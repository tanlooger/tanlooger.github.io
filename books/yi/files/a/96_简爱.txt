第一章


那天，出去散步是不可能了。实际上，上午我们已经在光秃秃的灌木丛中闲逛了一个小时。但是午饭以后（在家里没有客人时，里德太太总是开饭很早），冬日凛冽的寒风刮来密布的阴云，接着就是大雨倾盆，在这样糟糕的天气下不可能再有什么户外活动了。

我却很高兴，因为我向来不喜欢长距离的散步，尤其是在阴冷的午后。在冰冷的黄昏回到家中，手脚都冻僵了，还会因为保姆贝茜的训斥而心情忧郁，因为自己身体没有伊丽莎、约翰和乔治亚娜好而羞愧。那种感觉真可怕。

此时此刻，刚才提到的伊丽莎、约翰和乔治亚娜都在客厅里围着他们的妈妈。她则躺在壁炉边的沙发上，身边坐着自己的小宝贝们（眼下既未争吵也未哭叫），看上去十分幸福满足。而我呢，她准许我不必加入他们了，还会说，不得不让我独自一人待在一旁她很遗憾。但是要等到保姆贝茜向她报告，或者是她亲眼看到，我确实是在认真努力养成更为随和、更为活泼可爱的行为举止——也就是更欢快、更坦白、更自然一些，否则，她不会让我享受只有快乐知足的孩子才能享受到的特权。

“贝茜说我干什么啦？”我问。

“简，我不喜欢吹毛求疵或者刨根问底的人，况且，一个小孩子这样和长辈顶嘴实在让人讨厌。去找个地方待着，在学会好好说话之前，把嘴闭上。”

客厅的隔壁有一间小餐室，我溜了进去。里面有一个书架。我很快地就挑了一本书——特意挑了一本插图多的，然后爬上窗台，收拢双脚，像土耳其人那样盘腿坐下，将红色的波纹窗帘几乎完全拉严，把自己双重地隐蔽起来。

在我的右侧，褶皱重重的猩红色窗幔遮住了我的视线；在我的左侧，是明亮的玻璃窗，它们保护着我，让我免受十一月阴沉天气的侵害，却又没有把我和外面的世界隔绝。在翻书的间隙，我时不时地向窗外眺望一下冬日的景色。只见远方白茫茫一片云雾，近处则是湿漉漉的草地和被风雨袭击的灌木。一阵持久凄厉的狂风驱赶着冬季连绵的暴雨横扫而过。

我重又低下头来看书——比维克[1]的《英国禽鸟史》。我一般对文字部分不感兴趣，但是有几页导言，虽说我是孩子，却也不愿意完全当做空白随手翻过去。它的内容写的是只有海鸟们栖居的“孤寂的岩石和海岬”；写到了挪威的海岸，从最南端的林纳斯尼斯[2]，也就是纳斯，到北角[3]，沿着海岸线，许多小岛星罗棋布：





那里，北冰洋掀起的巨大旋涡，

围绕着极地光秃凄凉的小岛咆哮；

大西洋的汹涌波涛，

泻入了风雨交加的赫布里底群岛[4]。





还有一些地方我也不能不看，那就是书中提到的拉普兰[5]、西伯利亚、斯匹次卑尔根群岛、新地岛[6]、冰岛和格陵兰的荒凉海岸。那里“广袤无垠的北极地带和一片片凄凉广漠荒无人烟的地区——那里储存着千百年的冰雪，千百个寒冬积聚成的坚硬的冰原，像阿尔卑斯山的层层高峰——晶莹光滑，它们包围着极地，日复一日堆积着严寒”。我对这些惨白色的区域，已经形成了自己的想法：朦朦胧胧，就像所有那些似懂非懂的概念那样，它们隐约掠过孩子们的脑海，但却又出奇的生动。导言中的这几页文字，与后面的小插图都是有关系的，使得那些孤立在浪花飞溅、波涛汹涌的大海中的礁石，搁浅在荒凉海岸上的破船，以及从云缝间俯视沉船的像幽灵般冷漠的月亮，都显得意味深长了。

我说不清楚是一种什么样的感情萦绕在墓地上：那里有刻有铭文的墓碑、一扇大门、两棵树、低低的地平线、衰败的围墙。还有一弯初升的新月，表明正是黄昏时分。

两艘轮船停泊在水波不兴的海面上，我觉得它们好像是海上的鬼怪。

魔鬼从背后按住窃贼的背包，那情景实在可怕，我赶快翻了过去。

头上长角的黑色怪物独踞于岩石之上，远远望着一大群人围着绞架，也同样可怕。

每幅画都在讲述一个故事；由于我理解力不足，欣赏水平也有限，它们往往显得神秘莫测，但仍旧令人颇感兴趣，就像在某些冬夜，贝茜碰巧心情不错时讲述的故事一样。那时，她会把熨衣桌搬到育儿室的壁炉旁边，让我们围着它坐好，她一边熨里德太太的蕾丝装饰，把她睡帽边缘烫出褶皱来，一边让我们迫不及待地听着她讲的一段段爱情和历险的故事。她的这些片段都来自于古老的神话传说和更古老的歌谣，或者是我后来的发现，来自《帕梅拉》[7]和《莫兰伯爵亨利》[8]的故事。

我把比维克的书放在膝上，觉得很快乐，至少是自得其乐。我最担心的是有人来打搅，但打扰偏偏来得很快。餐室的门开了。

“嗨，忧郁小姐！”约翰·里德大喊着，接着停下了，显然他已经发觉房间里空无一人。

“见鬼，她去哪儿了？”他接着喊，“丽茜[9]！乔琪[10]！”（喊着他的姐妹）“琼[11]不在这儿，告诉妈妈她跑到雨地里去了——坏东西！”

“幸好我拉上了窗帘。”我想，我真希望他发现不了我的藏身之处。约翰·里德自己是发现不了我的，他眼不尖，头脑也不灵敏。但是伊丽莎刚在门口探头一望，就立刻说：

“她在窗台上，肯定没错，杰克[12]。”

我立即走了出来，因为一想到要被这个杰克硬拖出去浑身就开始发抖。

“什么事？”我既尴尬又害怕。

“要说‘什么事，里德少爷？’”他说，“我要你到这里来。”他在扶手椅上坐下，打了个手势示意我到他面前去。

约翰·里德是一个十四岁的小学生，比我大四岁，因为我才十岁。以他的年龄来说，他长得又大又胖，皮肤发暗，一副病态；宽脸盘，粗线条，胖胖的四肢，手脚都很大；还喜欢暴饮暴食，结果肝火很旺，目光迟钝，两颊松弛。现在，他本应该待在学校里，可是他妈妈把他接回家住一两个月，说是“身体虚弱”。但他的老师迈尔斯先生却断言，如果家里少送些糕点、糖果去，他会什么都很好的。但是他的母亲不能接受这么粗暴的意见，而倾向于一种更体面的想法，认为约翰之所以脸色不好，是因为过于用功，或者是想家造成的。

约翰对母亲和姐妹们没有多少感情，而对我更是厌恶。他欺侮我，虐待我，不是一周两三次，也不是一天一两次，而是经常如此。我的每根神经都怕他，只要他一靠近我，我骨头上的每块肌肉都会收缩起来。有时我会被他吓得手足无措，因为面对他的恐吓和欺侮，我无处哭诉。用人们不愿站在我这边去得罪他们的少爷，而里德太太则装聋作哑，仿佛她从来没有见过他打我骂我，尽管他动不动就当着她的面这样做，当然不用说，背着她的时候就更多了。

我已经习惯对约翰逆来顺受，走到他椅子前。足有两三分钟，他拼命向我伸着舌头，就差没有绷断舌根。我知道他马上就会动手打我了，一面担心挨打，一面打量着这个就要动手的人的那副令人厌恶的丑态。我不知道他是不是从我的脸上看到了这个想法，反正他二话没说，突然朝我使劲打过来。我一个踉跄，从他椅子前倒退了一两步才站稳身子。

“这是对你的教训，谁叫你刚才那么无礼跟我妈妈顶嘴，”他说，“谁叫你鬼鬼祟祟躲到窗帘后面，谁叫你两分钟之前眼里那副神气，你这只耗子！”

我已经习惯约翰·里德的辱骂，从来不愿去理睬，一心只想着如何去忍受辱骂以后必然而来的殴打。

“你躲在窗帘后面干什么？”他问。

“看书。”

“把书拿来。”

我回到窗前把书拿过来。

“你没有资格动我们的书。妈妈说，你靠别人养活，你没有钱，你爸爸什么也没留给你，你应当去讨饭，而不该和我们这样体面人家的孩子一起生活，不该和我们吃一样的饭，穿妈妈花钱买来的衣服。现在我要教训教训你，让你知道乱翻我的书架的后果。这些书都是我的，连整座房子都是，或者说过几年就是了。滚，站到门口去，别站在镜子和窗子前。”

我照他的话做了，起初并不知道他的用意。但一看到他把书举起，站起身子要朝我扔过来的架势时，我本能地发出一声惊叫，往旁边一躲。但已经晚了，书已经扔过来，打中了我。我跌倒了，头撞在门上磕破了。伤口开始流血，疼痛难忍；我的恐惧心理已经超过了极限，被其他情感所代替。

“你是个恶毒残暴的坏孩子！”我说，“你像个杀人犯——你是个奴隶监工——你像罗马的暴君！”

我读过哥尔德斯密[13]的《罗马史》，对尼禄[14]、卡利古拉[15]等人物已有自己的看法，并暗暗作过一些对比，但绝没想到竟然会如此大声地说出来。

“什么！什么！”他嚷起来，“她竟敢对我说这样的话？伊丽莎、乔治亚娜，你们听见了吗？我是不是应该告诉妈妈？不过我得先——”

他向我直冲过来，我只觉得他抓住了我的头发和肩膀，他和一个像我这样不顾死活的人扭打在一起了。我发现他真是一个暴君，一个杀人犯。我觉得有一两滴血从我头上顺着脖子淌下来，感到一阵剧痛。这些感觉压倒了恐惧，我发疯似的与他对打起来。我不太清楚自己的双手究竟干了些什么，只听见他骂我“耗子！耗子！”，一面大声号叫。他的帮手就在身边，伊丽莎和乔治亚娜早已经跑出去搬救兵了。里德太太本来在楼上，她来到现场，后面跟随着贝茜和女佣艾博特。我们被拉开了，我只听到她们说：

“哎呀！哎呀！这么大的脾气，敢打约翰少爷！”

“谁见过发这么大脾气的！”

里德太太接着说：

“把她带到红房子里关起来。”立刻有两双手按住了我，把我推上了楼。

第二章


我一路反抗，这对我来说还是头一次，这大大加深了贝茜和艾博特小姐对我的厌恶。我确实有点儿难以自制，或者如法国人所说，失常了。我知道，一时的反抗会给我带来难以想象的惩罚。因此，像其他造反的奴隶一样，我在绝望中下定决心，决计不顾一切了。

“抓住她的胳膊，艾博特小姐，她像一只发了疯的猫。”

“真丢脸！真丢脸！”这位女主人的侍女叫道，“多可怕的举动，爱小姐，居然打起小少爷来了，他是你恩人的儿子，你的小主人！”

“主人，他怎么会是我的主人，难道我是仆人吗？”

“不是，你连仆人都不如。你白吃白住，什么也不干。好啦，坐下来，好好想一想你自己干的坏事。”

这时候她们已经把我拖进了里德太太指定的那个房间，把我按在一张凳子上，我禁不住像弹簧一样跳起来，但立刻又被两双手按住了。

“如果你不老老实实地坐着，我们就得把你绑起来了。”贝茜说，“艾博特小姐，把你的吊袜带借给我，我那副肯定会被她一下子绷断的。”

艾博特小姐动手从她粗壮的腿上解下要用的带子。捆绑前的准备工作以及由此带来的加倍的羞辱，使我激动的情绪稍稍得到了缓解。

“不要解了，”我叫道，“我不动就是了。”

作为保证，我双手紧抓着凳子。

“记住别动。”贝茜说。当她确信我真的平静下来了，就放开了我。然后她和艾博特小姐抱着胳膊站在那儿，沉着脸，不放心地瞪着我，仿佛不相信我的精神还是正常似的。

“她以前从来没有这样过呀。”最后贝茜转向阿比盖尔[1]说。

“不过这种本性她一直都有。”对方回答，“我经常和太太说我对这孩子的看法，太太也同意。她真是一个狡猾的小东西，我还从来没见过哪个像她这样年纪的小姑娘，有这么多鬼心眼的。”

贝茜没有说话，但过了一会儿，她对我说：“小姐，你应该明白，你受了里德太太的恩惠，是她养着你的。如果她把你赶走，你就得进贫民院了。”

对于她的这番话，我无话可说，因为这听起来并不新鲜。事实上，我生活的最早的记忆中就包含着类似的暗示。靠别人养活，这种责备在我的耳朵中已经成了含义模糊的老生常谈：让人痛苦难忍，但我又似懂非懂。艾博特小姐接着说：

“你不能因为太太好心让你和里德小姐和少爷一起长大，就以为自己与他们平等了。他们将来会有很多很多钱，而你却一个子儿也不会有。你得学着谦恭些，尽力去讨好他们。”

“我们这么说，都是为了你好，”贝茜补充道，口气并不严厉，“你应该学得有用一点，讨人喜欢一点，那样也许还可以在这儿住下去。如果你一味倔犟，动不动就使性子，那么，我敢说，太太肯定会把你撵走的。”

“再说，”艾博特小姐说，“上帝会惩罚她，也许会在她乱发脾气的时候，把她处死，到时候她能上哪儿呢？来吧，贝茜，咱们走吧，别管她。反正我是没有办法得到她的好感的。爱小姐，你一个人待着的时候，做做祈祷吧。如果你不忏悔的话，说不定有个邪恶的东西会从烟囱里进来，把你带走。”

她们走了，关了门，还上了锁。

红房子是个空房间，很少有人在这儿过夜。其实，也可以说，从来没有。除非偶尔盖茨黑德府上来了一大批客人，有必要动用全部房间时。但它却是整座房子里最宽敞、最富丽堂皇的了。正中间摆放着一张由很粗的红木柱子支撑起来的床，罩着深红色的锦缎帐幔，像一个帐篷。屋子里还有两扇大窗户，但是窗帘总是紧闭，被同一色帷幔布制成的流苏遮得严严的。地毯是红色的，床脚边的桌子上铺着深红色的台布，墙是柔和的淡褐色，略带粉红。衣橱、梳妆台和椅子都是乌黑发亮的红木做的。床上堆着层层的褥垫和枕头，上面铺着雪白的马赛布床罩，在周围深色调陈设的映衬下，白得耀眼。几乎同样显眼的是床头一把铺着坐垫的大安乐椅，一样的白色，前面还放着一只脚凳，在我看来，它像一个苍白的宝座。

屋子里难得生火，所以很冷；因为离育儿室和厨房都很远，所以很静；又因为谁都知道很少有人进来，所以显得庄严肃穆。只有女佣每逢星期六到这里来，把一周内静悄悄落在镜子上和家具上的灰尘抹去。还有里德太太本人，隔很长时间才来一次，查看一下衣橱里某个秘密抽屉里的东西。那里面存放着各类羊皮纸文契、她的首饰盒，还有她已故丈夫的肖像。这最后一点就是红房子的神秘和魔力所在，使得它虽然富丽堂皇，却分外凄凉。

里德先生已经过世九年了，他就是在这间房子里咽气的，也是在这里入殓的，殡葬工从这里抬走了他的灵柩。从此之后，这里便始终弥漫着一种阴森森的祭奠氛围，所以很少有人进来。

贝茜和刻薄的艾博特小姐让我一动不动坐在靠近大理石壁炉的一条软垫矮凳上。我面前就耸立着这张床，我的右面是黑沉沉的衣橱，柔和斑驳的反光使橱壁板的光泽摇曳变幻。我左面是关得紧紧的窗子，两扇窗子中间有一面大镜子，映照出床和房间的空旷和肃穆。我不能肯定她们是否把门锁上了，等我敢走动的时候，就起来去看。哎呀，真锁上了，比牢房锁得还紧。走回原处时，必须经过那面大镜子。我的目光被吸引着不由自主地向镜中去看个究竟。在虚幻的映像中，一切都显得比现实中更冷漠、更阴沉。里面那个陌生的小家伙直瞪着我，苍白的胳膊和脸上都蒙上了斑驳的阴影，在一切都凝滞时，只有那双惊惶发亮的眼睛在转动，看上去真像是一个幽灵。我觉得它就像那种半神半妖的小精灵，贝茜在夜晚的故事中讲过，它们从沼泽地带山蕨丛生的荒谷中冒出来，出现在迟归的旅行者眼前。我回到了我的矮凳上。

那时我真有点迷信了，不过还没有到完全听凭它摆布的程度，我依然热血沸腾，奴隶反叛的那种情绪依然激励着我。要我在可怕的现实面前低头，就得首先克制住自己不再去回忆那些如潮的往事。

约翰·里德的专横霸道，他姐妹们的高傲冷漠，他母亲的憎恶，仆人们的偏心，像一口混沌的井中黑色的沉淀物，在我混乱的脑海中不断翻滚着。为什么我总是受苦，总是遭人白眼，受人欺侮，受到责备呢？为什么我永远不能讨人喜欢？为什么我竭力想赢得别人的好感，却总是徒劳呢？伊丽莎自私任性，却受到尊敬；乔治亚娜脾气被惯坏了，尖酸刻薄，而且强词夺理，盛气凌人，偏偏得到所有人的纵容。她的美貌，她红润的面颊，金色的鬈发，使得她人见人爱，不管有什么错都可以得到原谅。至于约翰，没有人敢顶撞他，更不用说受到惩罚了，尽管他扭断鸽子的脖颈，弄死小孔雀，放狗去咬羊，摘掉温室中的葡萄，掐断暖房珍贵花木的嫩芽；有时还叫他母亲“老姑娘”，还骂她皮肤黑，尽管他的皮肤也是一样黑。他蛮横，不听她的话，经常撕破她的丝绸服装，而他却依然是“她的心肝宝贝”。而我不敢犯一点错，尽力把每一件事做好，不敢有丝毫闪失，别人却还是说我淘气、讨厌、阴险、鬼鬼祟祟，从早上说到下午，从下午说到晚上。

我被他打倒，头还在疼，还流着血。约翰蛮横地打了我，却没有人责备他，而我不过为了免遭进一步无理殴打，反抗了一下，便受到了众人的指责。

“不公平——太不公平了！”我的理智呼喊着。在痛苦的刺激下我的理智变得早熟，化作一种短暂的力量。而同样被激起来的决心也在怂恿着我采取某种不寻常的办法来逃脱这难以忍受的压迫——比如逃跑，或者不行的话，就不吃不喝，活活饿死。

在那个阴沉的下午，我心里多么惶恐不安！我的整个脑子乱成一团，我的整颗心在反抗：然而那场内心斗争又显得多么茫然，多么无知啊！我无法回答心底那不断提出的疑问——为什么我要如此受苦？如今，在相隔——我不愿说隔了多少年以后，我才完全明白。

我在盖茨黑德府上格格不入。在那里我和谁都不像。和里德太太、她的孩子、她赏识的仆人没有一点一致的地方。他们不爱我，说实在的，我也一样不爱他们。他们没有必要热情对待一个与自己合不来的家伙，无论是个性、地位，还是爱好都和他们相反；在他们看来，我是个毫无用处的家伙，既不能给他们提供帮助，也不能给他们增添欢乐；我是一个讨厌的家伙，对他们的虐待越来越憎恨，对他们的想法越来越不屑一顾。我明白，如果我是一个乐观开朗、聪明伶俐、无忧无虑、漂亮顽皮的孩子，即使同样是寄人篱下，同样是无亲无故，里德太太也会对我的处境更加宽容忍耐，她的孩子们也会对我亲切热情一些，用人们也不会动辄在育儿室把我当做替罪羊了。

阳光开始从红房子里退去，已经四点多了，阴沉的下午正在变为凄凉的黄昏。我听见雨点仍不停地敲打着楼梯的窗户，狂风在屋后的树丛中怒号。我渐渐地冻得像块石头，勇气也随之消失了。我惯有的自卑心理、自我怀疑和孤独沮丧的情绪，像凉水一样浇灭了我越来越弱的怒火。大家都说我坏，也许我真的不好吧。我刚才不是还想着饿死自己吗？这当然是一种罪过。而我该不该死呢？或者，盖茨黑德教堂圣坛下的墓穴是个令人向往的归宿？听说里德先生就被埋葬在那样的墓穴里。这一念头又勾起了我对他的回忆，而且越想越害怕。我已经记不起他了，只知道他是我的舅舅——我母亲的哥哥——他收养了我这个襁褓中的孤儿，而且在弥留之际，要里德太太答应，把我当做她自己的孩子来抚养。里德太太也许认为自己是遵守诺言的，我敢说在她的天性允许的范围内，她确实是这样做的。可是她怎么能真心喜欢一个丈夫死后就和她毫无关系的人呢？她为了勉强做出的保证而不得不去当一个她无法喜爱的孩子的母亲，眼看着一个趣味不相投的外人永远硬挤在自己的家人中间。对她来说，这肯定是件最恼人的事情了。

我忽然有了一个奇怪的想法。我不怀疑——也从来没有怀疑过——里德先生如果还在世的话，一定会待我很好。此刻，我坐在这里，打量着白色的床和昏暗的墙壁，不时还用禁不住诱惑的目光瞥一眼隐隐发亮的镜子，不由得想起了关于死人的种种传说。据说由于人们违背了他们临终的嘱托，他们在坟墓里也不安宁，便重回人间，惩罚不遵守誓言的人，为受害者报仇。我想，里德先生的幽灵为外甥女的冤屈所动，会离开他的住所，不管那是教堂的墓穴，还是死者居住的无人知晓的世界，来到这间房子，站在我面前。我抹去眼泪，忍住哭泣，担心号啕大哭会惊动什么不可知的声音来安慰我，或者在昏暗中招来某些带光环的面孔，带着怪异的怜悯表情俯身看着我。这个想法，从理论上来说会令人感到安慰，但如果真的实现了却十分可怕。我竭力不去想它，把垂在眼睛上的头发甩开，抬起头来，大着胆子环顾了一下漆黑的房间。就在这时，墙上闪过一道亮光。我问自己，会不会是一缕月光，透过百叶窗的缝隙照了进来？不，月光是静止的，而这道亮光却是流动的。我正看着时，它滑到了天花板上，在我头顶上抖动起来。现在我会很自然地联想到，那很可能是有人提着灯笼穿过草地时射进来的光。但那时，我脑子里只想到恐惧的事，我的神经也由于激动而极其脆弱，我认为那道飞快掠过的光，是某个幽灵从另一个世界到来的先兆。我的心怦怦乱跳，头发晕，耳朵里充满了一种声音，我以为是翅膀的拍击声，好像什么东西已经逼近我了。我感到压抑，感到窒息，再也忍不住了。我冲向门口，不顾一切地拼命摇着门锁。外面走廊上响起了飞奔而来的脚步声，钥匙转动了，贝茜和艾博特走进房间。

“爱小姐，你不舒服吗？”

“多可怕的声音！简直钻到我的心里去了！”

“把我带出去！让我到育儿室去！”我喊道。

“怎么了？你受伤了吗？你看到什么东西了吗？”

“啊！我看到了一道光，我想一定是鬼来了。”这时，我拉住了贝茜的手，她没有抽回去。

“她是故意乱叫的，”艾博特厌烦地说，“而且叫得那么凶！如果她真有那么大的痛苦，倒还可以原谅，可她只不过要把我们骗到这里来，我知道她那套鬼把戏。”

“到底是怎么回事？”一个严厉的声音问道。里德太太从走廊里走过来，松开的帽带飘动着，长衣沙沙作响。“艾博特、贝茜，我想我吩咐过，让简·爱待在红房子里，直到我自己来看她。”

“简小姐叫得那么响，太太。”贝茜辩解道。

“别管她。”这是唯一的回答，“松开贝茜的手，孩子。你尽可放心，靠这些办法，是出不去的，我讨厌耍花招，尤其是小孩子，我有责任让你知道，鬼把戏不管用。现在你要在这里多待一个小时，而且只有你完全顺从，安静下来，才会放你出来。”

“啊，舅妈，可怜可怜我吧。饶了我吧！我实在受不了啦，用别的办法惩罚我吧！我会吓死的，如果——”

“住嘴！这么闹闹嚷嚷讨厌透了。”她无疑就是这么感觉的。在她眼里我是个早熟的演员，她从心底认为，我是个本性恶毒、心灵卑劣、为人阴险的货色。

贝茜和艾博特退了出去。里德太太对我疯也似的痛苦号叫很不耐烦，不想再和我多费口舌，猛地把我往后一推，锁上了门。我听见她匆匆走开了；她走后不久，我大概经历了一阵痉挛，昏了过去，结束了这场吵闹。

第三章


接下来我记得的是，我仿佛从一场可怕的噩梦中醒来，眼前闪烁着刺目的红光，中间横着一根根又粗又黑的线。我还听到了沉闷的说话声，仿佛被一阵风声或水声盖住了。激动不安以及压倒一切的恐怖感，使我神志模糊了。不久，我明白有人在照料我，把我扶起来，让我靠着他坐着。我觉得以前从来没有被人这么温柔体贴地抱起过，我把头倚在一个枕头上或是一条胳膊上，感到很舒服。

五分钟后，迷茫的云烟消散了。我完全清醒了，知道我是在自己的床上，那红光是育儿室的炉火。已经是夜里了，桌上点着蜡烛。贝茜端着脸盆站在床脚边，一位老先生坐在我枕边的椅子上，俯身向着我。

我知道房间里有一个陌生人，一个不属于盖茨黑德府，又和里德太太非亲非故的人。这时，我感到了一种难以言表的宽慰，一种安全感。我的目光离开贝茜（尽管有她在身边远没有艾博特那么讨厌），细细端详这位先生的脸。我认识他，他是劳埃德先生，是个药剂师，有时里德太太请他来给用人们看病。但她自己和孩子们不舒服时，请的是位内科医生。

“瞧，我是谁？”他问。

我说出了他的名字，同时把手伸给他，他握住了我的手，微微一笑说：“慢慢会好起来的。”然后他扶我躺下，对贝茜说，一定要小心，夜里别让我受到打扰。他又交代了几句，说了第二天再来，就走了。我非常难过。有他坐在我枕边的椅子上，我感到既温暖又亲近，而他一走，门一关上，整个房间暗淡了下来，我的心再次沉重起来，一种无可名状的哀伤压在我的心头。

“你想睡了吗，小姐？”贝茜问，口气相当温和。

我几乎不敢回答她，生怕她下一句又是粗声粗气了。“我试试看。”

“你想喝什么，或者能吃点什么吗？”

“不想，谢谢，贝茜。”

“那我去睡了，已经过了十二点啦，不过如果你夜里需要什么，尽管叫我。”

多么殷勤有礼啊！于是我大着胆子问了个问题。

“贝茜，我怎么了？病了吗？”

“你是病了，是在红房子里哭得生病了，不过肯定很快就会好的。”

贝茜走进了附近用人的卧房。我听见她说：

“萨拉，过来同我一起睡在育儿室吧。今天晚上，我怎么也不敢自己陪那个可怜的孩子过夜了。她说不定会死的。真奇怪她竟会昏过去。不知道她看见了什么。里德太太也太狠心了。”

萨拉跟着她回来了，两个人都上了床，互相悄声低语地讲了半个小时才睡着。我只听到了只言片语，但我可以清楚地推断出她们谈论的主题。

“有个东西从她身边经过，一身雪白的衣服，转眼就不见了……”“一条大黑狗跟在他后面……”“在房门上重重地敲了三下……”“一道白光正好照在他教堂的坟墓上……”如此等等。

最后，两人都睡着了，炉火和烛光也熄灭了。我就这样充满恐惧地醒着挨过了漫漫长夜，害怕得耳朵、眼睛和头脑都紧张起来，这种恐惧只有孩子们才能感受到。

红房子事件并没有给我的身体留下严重或长期的后遗症，它只是使我的精神受了惊吓，对此我至今仍记忆犹新。是的，里德太太，你让我受了可怕的精神创伤，但我应当原谅你，因为你并不明白自己干了些什么，你折磨我的心的时候，却还以为是在根除我的恶习。

第二天中午，我起来穿好衣服，裹了块浴巾，坐在育儿室的壁炉旁边。我身体虚弱，像要垮掉一样。但最大的痛楚却是内心难以言传的痛苦，我不断默默地流泪。我刚把一滴咸咸的眼泪从脸颊上抹去，另一滴又滚落下来。不过，我想我应该高兴，因为里德一家人都不在，他们坐马车出去了。艾博特在另一间屋里做针线活，而贝茜呢，来回忙碌着，一边把玩具收拾起来，把抽屉整理好，一边还不时地和我说两句少有的体贴话。对我来说，过惯了那种成天挨骂、辛辛苦苦吃力不讨好的日子后，眼前这种情况对我来说应该是个宁静的天堂了。然而，我的精神已被折磨得痛苦不堪，任何平静也无法让它们得到安慰，任何乐趣也难以让它们兴奋起来。

贝茜下楼去了一趟厨房，端上来一个馅饼，用一个图案鲜艳的瓷盘盛着，图案上画的是一只极乐鸟，偎依在旋花和玫瑰花苞上。这幅画曾引起我热烈的赞叹，我曾经恳求过几次，要把盘子拿在手里仔细瞧瞧，但总是被认为不配享受这样的特权。此刻，这只珍贵的器皿就放在我的膝头，我还受到热诚的邀请，品尝器皿里一小圈精美的糕点。徒然的好意啊！和其他久久盼望却始终得不到的期望一样，来得太晚了！我吃不下这馅饼，而那鸟的羽毛和花卉的色泽也奇怪地黯然无光了。我把盘子和馅饼推开，贝茜问我要不要看书。“书”这个字像一帖速效的兴奋剂产生了效力，我请她去图书室取来一本《格列佛游记》。我曾兴致勃勃地一遍又一遍地读过这本书，认为书中叙述的都是真事，觉得比童话中写的还有趣。就说那些小矮人吧，我曾在指顶花叶子与花冠之间，在蘑菇底下和爬满老墙角落的常春藤下遍寻无着之后，最后只好灰心丧气地承认：他们都已逃离英国到某个原始树林更茂密，人烟更稀少的荒凉乡间去了。在我的信念中，小人国和大人国都是地球表面实实在在的一部分。我毫不怀疑有朝一日我会去远航，亲眼看一看一个王国里小小的田野、小小的房子、小小的树木，看一看那里的小人、小牛、小羊和小鸟们，亲眼看一看另一个王国里如森林一般高耸的玉米地、硕大的猛犬、巨大无比的猫以及高塔一般的人们。然而，此刻当我手里捧着这本珍爱的书，一页页翻过去，从奇妙的插图中寻找以前从来不会落空的魅力时，我找到的只是怪诞和乏味。巨人成了瘦骨嶙峋的妖怪，小人全都是恶毒可怖的小鬼，而格列佛则已是陷身于险境的孤独的流浪者了。我不敢往下看了，合上书，把它放在桌上未尝过的馅饼旁边。

现在贝茜已经收拾好房间，洗了手，她打开一个小抽屉，那里面装着一些漂亮的零碎绸缎，她要给乔治亚娜的洋娃娃做一顶新帽子。她边做边唱着：





很久很久以前，

我们像吉卜赛人一样到处流浪。





我以前常听这首歌，每次都觉得欢快悦耳，因为贝茜的嗓子很甜，至少我认为如此。而此刻，虽然她甜蜜的嗓子依旧，但歌里却透出了一种难以言喻的悲哀。有时，她干活出了神，把一句歌词拉得很长，唱得很低沉，一句“很久很久以前”唱出来，就像是送葬曲最哀伤的调子。她接着又唱起一首民谣来，这一首真的很悲伤凄凉。





我的双脚酸痛了，四肢酸麻了，

可是，路途遥远，山野荒凉。

没有月光啊暮色苍茫，

笼罩着苦命孤儿的旅途。



为什么要让我孤苦伶仃远走他乡，

流落在荒野连绵、峭岩重叠的异地。

人心狠毒啊，唯有天使善良，

保佑苦命孤儿的脚步。



从远处吹来了柔和的夜风，

晴空中繁星闪烁着温煦的光芒。

仁慈的上帝啊，你赐福于万众，

苦命的孤儿得到了保护、安慰和希望。



即使我从断桥跌入深渊，

或是在迷茫恍惚中误入泥沼，

天父啊，你带着祝福与许诺，

把苦命的孤儿搂入你怀抱。



即使我无家可归无亲无故，

有个信念能赋予我力量。

天堂啊，永远是归宿和安息之所，

上帝永远是苦命孤儿的朋友。





“来吧，简小姐，别哭了。”贝茜唱完了说。她还不如去对着炉火说：“别燃烧了！”不过，她又怎么能知道折磨我的巨大的痛苦呢？

早上劳埃德先生又来了。“怎么，已经起床了！”他一进育儿室就说，“嗯，保姆，她怎么样了？”

贝茜回答说我很好。

“那她应该高兴才是。过来，简小姐，你的名字叫简，是吗？”

“是的，先生，我叫简·爱。”

“瞧，你一直在哭，简·爱小姐，你能告诉我为什么吗？哪儿疼吗？”

“不疼，先生。”

“啊，我想是因为不能跟小姐们一起坐马车出去才哭的。”贝茜插嘴说。

“肯定不是！她那么大了，不会为这点小事哭鼻子的。”

这正是我的想法。而她这么冤枉我，伤了我的自尊，所以我当即回答：“我长这么大从来没有为这种事哭过，而且我又讨厌乘马车出去。我是因为心里难受才哭的。”

“呸，小姐！”贝茜说。

好心的药剂师似乎有些迷惑不解。我站在他面前，他目不转睛地看着我。他灰色的小眼睛并不十分有神，但现在想来也许应当说是非常锐利的。他其貌不扬，却和蔼可亲，他不慌不忙地打量了我一会儿说：

“昨天你怎么得病的呢？”

“她跌了一跤。”贝茜又插嘴了。

“摔倒了？这又像个小孩子了！她都这么大了还不会走路？总有八九岁了吧。”

“我是被人给打倒的。”自尊心再次受到伤害引起我的不快，我脱口而出，冒昧地作了这样的辩解。“但光这样也不会生病。”这时劳埃德先生取了一撮鼻烟吸起来。

他把烟盒放入背心口袋。这时，铃声大作，叫用人们去吃饭。他知道这一点。“那是叫你的，保姆，”他说，“你下楼去吧，我来开导开导简小姐，等你回来。”

贝茜本想留下，可是又不得不走，准时吃饭是盖茨黑德府的一条严格的规矩。

“你不是因为摔了跤而生病吧？那么为什么呢？”贝茜一走，劳埃德先生接着问道。

“他们把我关在一间闹鬼的房子里，一直到天黑。”

我看到劳埃德先生微微一笑，同时又皱起眉头来。“鬼？瞧，你毕竟还是个小孩子！你怕鬼吗？”

“我怕里德先生的鬼魂，他就死在那间房子里，还在那里停过灵。无论贝茜，还是别人，晚上只要能不进去，谁也不会去的。太狠心了，把我一个人关在里面，连支蜡烛也不点——那么狠心，我一辈子都忘不了。”

“胡说！就因为这个你心里难受吗，现在白天你还怕吗？”

“现在不怕，不过马上又要到晚上了。再说，我不快活，很不快活，为了一些别的事情。”

“别的什么事？能说给我听听吗？”

我多么希望能详详细细地回答这个问题！然而，要做出回答又是多么困难：孩子们能够感觉，但无法分析自己的情感，即使在脑子里做了部分分析，却还不知道如何用语言去表达分析的结论。但是我又担心失去这第一次也是唯一一次诉苦的机会，所以局促不安地踌躇了一会儿以后，终于做出了一个尽管贫乏但就其本身来讲仍相当真实的回答。

“首先，我没有父母，没有兄弟姐妹。”

“可是你有一位和蔼可亲的舅母，还有表兄妹们。”

我又停了一会儿，然后笨拙地说：

“可是约翰·里德把我打倒了，而舅妈又把我关在红房子里。”

劳埃德先生再次掏出了鼻烟盒。

“你不觉得盖茨黑德府是座漂亮的房子吗？”他问，“让你住那么好的一个地方，你难道不感激吗？”

“这又不是我的房子，先生。艾博特还说我比这儿的用人还不如呢！”

“哎！你总不至于傻得想离开这么好的地方吧？”

“如果我有别的地方去，我会很高兴离开这儿的。可是只要我还没长大，我就不能离开盖茨黑德。”

“也许可以——谁知道呢？除了里德太太，你还有别的亲戚吗？”

“我想没有了，先生。”

“你父亲那头也没有了吗？”

“我不知道，有一回我问过舅妈，她说可能有些姓爱的亲戚，不过他们又穷又没有地位，她对他们的情况也不太清楚。”

“如果有这样的亲戚，你愿意去吗？”

我陷入了沉思，在成年人看来贫困是可怕的，对于孩子则更是如此。他们不大明白那种勤奋干活、受人尊重的贫穷。他们以为，贫穷这个字眼只与衣衫褴褛，缺少食物，没有炉火，举止粗鲁以及低贱的恶习联系在一起。对我来说，贫困就是堕落的同义词。

“不，我不愿意和穷人在一起。”这就是我的回答。

“即使他们对你很好也不愿意？”

我摇了摇头，不明白穷人怎么会有条件对人好，而且，我还要学得像他们那样说话、做事、没有教养，长大了像有时我见到的坐在盖茨黑德乡村茅屋门口的那种贫苦女人一样，奶孩子或者洗衣服。不，我可没有那样的英雄气概，宁愿牺牲身份来换取自由。

“不过你的亲戚都那么穷吗，都是靠干活过日子吗？”

“我不太清楚。里德舅妈说，即使我有亲戚，也准是一群要饭的，我可不愿去要饭。”

“你愿意上学吗？”

我再次沉思起来。我几乎不知道学校是什么样子的。只听贝茜有时说起过，好像在那个地方，年轻小姐们带着足枷，系着背板坐着，举止要非常文雅规矩。约翰·里德对学校恨之入骨，还大骂教师。不过他的感受对我来说不足为凭。如果贝茜关于校纪的说法（她来盖茨黑德之前，从她主人家一些年轻小姐那儿收集来的）有些骇人听闻，那么她细说的关于那些小姐所学得的才艺，也同样令我着迷。她绘声绘色地谈起了她们制作的风景画和花卉画，谈起了她们能唱的歌、能弹的曲子、能编织的钱包、能翻译的法文书，一直谈得我都动了心，想和她们比一比。而且，上学会彻底地改变环境——意味着一次远行，意味着完全离开盖茨黑德，意味着进入一种新的生活。

“我真的愿意去上学。”经过一番思索以后，我说出了结论。

“唉，唉，谁知道会发生什么呢？”劳埃德先生站起身来说。“这孩子应当换换空气，换换环境，”他自言自语地补充说，“神经不是很好。”

这时，贝茜回来了，同时砂石路上响起了马车的声音。

“是你们太太吗，保姆？”劳埃德先生问道，“走之前我想和她谈一谈。”

贝茜请他到早餐室，在前边带路。从以后发生的情况推测，药剂师在随后与里德太太的谈话中，大胆建议送我进学校。无疑，这个建议被欣然采纳了。一天夜里，艾博特和贝茜坐在育儿室里，做着针线活儿，谈起了这件事。那时，我已经上床，她们以为我睡着了。艾博特说：“我想太太一定巴不得摆脱这样一个坏脾气的讨厌孩子，这孩子就好像老用眼睛盯着每个人，像暗地里在搞什么阴谋似的。”我想艾博特肯定认为我是幼年的盖伊·福克斯[1]式的人物。

就是这一次，我从艾博特与贝茜的交谈中第一次知道，我父亲生前是个牧师，我母亲违背了朋友们的意愿嫁给了他，他们认为这桩婚事有失她的身份。我的外祖父里德，因为我母亲不听话而勃然大怒，同她断绝了关系，什么也没有留给她。父亲在一个大工业城镇当副牧师，因为奔走于供职地区的穷人中间——当时那儿正流行斑疹伤寒——而染上了那种病。我母亲从父亲那儿染上了同一疾病，结果父母双双故去，前后相距不到一个月，那时我父母亲结婚才一年。

贝茜听了这番话叹了口气说：“可怜的简小姐也真值得同情啊，艾博特。”

“是呀，”艾博特回答，“如果她是个乖巧漂亮的孩子，人们也许会同情她这么孤苦伶仃的，可是像她那样讨厌的小东西，的确不太讨人喜欢。”

“确实不太讨人喜欢，”贝茜也同意，“至少在同样的境况下，乔治亚娜这样的美人儿会更加惹人喜爱。”

“是呀，我就是喜欢乔治亚娜小姐！”艾博特大声说道，“真是个小宝贝儿——长长的鬈发、蓝蓝的眼睛，还有那么可爱的肤色，简直像画出来的一样！——贝茜，晚餐我真想吃威尔士兔子[2]。”

“我也一样——再配上烤洋葱。来，我们下楼去吧。”她们走了。

第四章


从我和劳埃德先生的谈话，还有上次听到贝茜和艾博特之间的议论以后，我信心倍增，动力十足，盼望着一切都好起来。看来，即将发生某种变化了，我也会默默地期待着。然而，它迟迟未来。一天天过去了，一周周过去了，我的身体已经恢复了，但我朝思暮想的那件事，却并没有被重新提起。里德太太有时用严厉的目光打量我，但很少和我说话。自从我生病以后，她在我和她的孩子之间划了一条比以前更加明显的界限：指定一个小房间让我一个人睡，罚我单独用餐，整天待在育儿室里，而我的表兄妹们却经常在客厅玩耍。她丝毫没有要送我上学的意思，但我有一种很有把握的直觉，她不会长期容忍我与她一起生活的，因为她每次看我的目光中越来越多地流露出一种无法克制的、深深的厌恶。

伊丽莎和乔治亚娜显然是按吩咐行事，尽量少和我说话。而约翰一见我就做鬼脸，有一回竟想对我动武。像上次一样，我被一种暴怒和死命反抗的情绪所激动，立刻转身扑了过去。他一想还是住手为好，就从我身边逃走了，一边嘴里还骂着，诬赖我打破了他的鼻子。我的拳头确实瞄准了他那个突起的部位，用力狠狠地打了他一拳。当我看到这一招或是我的目光使他吓破了胆时，我真想乘胜追击，达到目的，可是他已经逃到他妈妈那里去了。我听到他哭哭啼啼地开始诉说“那个讨厌的简·爱”如何像疯猫一样扑向他。但他的哭诉被严厉地喝住了。

“别跟我提起她，约翰。我和你说过不要走近她，她不值得我们理睬。我不愿意你或者你妹妹和她打交道。”

这时，我正倚在栏杆上，突然不假思索地大叫了一声：

“他们不配和我交往！”

尽管里德太太的体态有些臃肿，但一听见我这大胆的不可思议的声明时，却十分敏捷地跑上楼梯，一阵风似的把我拖进育儿室，把我按倒在小床边上，气势汹汹地说，看我今天还敢不敢再从这儿爬起来再说一句话。

“如果里德先生还活着，他会怎么说你？”我几乎无意中问了这个问题。我说几乎无意，是因为我的舌头似乎是未经意志的同意就自动吐出来了。

“什么？”里德太太压低了声音说。她平日冷漠平静的灰色眸子显得惶惶不安，露出了近乎恐惧的神色。她的手从我的胳膊中抽出来，死死地盯着我，仿佛真的弄不明白我究竟是个孩子还是个魔鬼。这时，我真是骑虎难下了。

“里德舅舅在天堂里，你做的和想的，他都看得清清楚楚。我爸爸妈妈也看得清清楚楚。他们知道你把我关了一整天，还巴不得我死掉。”

里德太太很快就恢复了常态，她用力地摇晃我，扇了我两记耳光，然后二话没说扔下我就走。在接下来的时间里，贝茜对我进行了长达一个小时的说教，证实我无疑是最坏、最任性的被人收养的孩子。我也有点相信她的话了。因为我确实觉得，在我的心里翻腾的尽是一些坏的想法。

十一月、十二月和一月的上半月都过去了。在盖茨黑德，圣诞节和元旦照例喜气洋洋地庆祝了一番，相互交换礼物，举行圣诞晚餐和晚会，当然，这些享受都与我无关，我的那份乐趣就是看着伊丽莎和乔治亚娜每天梳妆打扮，看她们穿上薄纱上衣，系着红腰带，头发被精心地卷过，下楼到客厅去。然后倾听楼下弹奏钢琴和竖琴的声音，管家和仆人来来往往的脚步声，上点心时杯盘相碰的声音，随着开关客厅门时断断续续传来的谈话声。当我对这种消遣感到厌烦时就离开楼梯口，走进冷清寂静的育儿室。在那儿虽然有点忧伤，但并不会让人心里难受。说实话，我不想去凑热闹，因为即使去了，也很少有人理我，如果贝茜能友好和善一些，我觉得和她一起安安静静地度过一个晚上，比在一间挤满了先生太太的房间里面对着里德太太那可怕的眼神要舒服多了。但是，贝茜给两位小姐打扮完，总会到厨房、女管家室等热闹的地方去，还总把蜡烛也带走。于是，我只好坐下来，把我的娃娃放在膝盖上，直到炉火渐渐熄灭，我偶尔向四周张望一下，以确信除了自己之外在这幽暗的房间里没有什么可怕的东西了。等炉火转为暗红色，我便赶紧脱衣服，用力地解开衣服上的纽扣和带子钻进小床，躲避寒冷与黑暗。我常把我的娃娃随身带到床上，人总得喜爱点什么。在缺乏更值得爱的东西的时候，我便想以珍爱一个退了色的布偶来得到一点乐趣。尽管这个娃娃已经破烂不堪，活像个小小的稻草人，此刻忆起这件往事，也使我迷惑不解，当时，我是多么可笑地喜爱着这个小玩具呀！我还有点相信它是活的，只有把它裹进了睡袍里我才能入睡，只有等它安安稳稳、暖暖和和地躺在那里，我才觉得愉快多了，而且相信它也一样的愉快。

在我等客人们散去，听着贝茜上楼的脚步声时，时间仿佛过得很慢很慢：有时她会中间上楼来，找顶针或剪刀，或者端上一个小面包、奶酪饼什么的当做我的晚餐。她会坐在床上看我吃，我一吃完，她会替我把衣服塞好，亲我两下，说：“晚安，简小姐。”当贝茜这样温柔的时候，我觉得她是世界上最好、最漂亮、最善良的人，我特别希望她总是那样和颜悦色，那么和蔼可亲，不要老是支使我，骂我，无端责备我。现在想来，贝茜一定是位很有天赋的姑娘，因为她干什么活都很出色，还有讲故事的出色才能，至少在育儿室讲故事留给我的印象，让我可以做出这样的判断。如果我对她的面容和身材没有记错的话，她还长得很漂亮。在我的记忆中，她是个身材苗条的姑娘，黑头发、黑眼睛、端正的五官和光洁的皮肤，不过她的脾气有点任性急躁，缺乏原则性和正义感。尽管如此，和盖茨黑德府中其他人比起来，我最喜欢的还是她。

那是一月十五日早上九点钟左右。贝茜下楼吃早餐了，我的表兄妹们还没有被叫到他们妈妈的身边。伊丽莎正戴上宽边帽，穿上暖和的园艺服，准备去喂她的家禽。这活儿她最喜欢干了，她也同样喜欢把鸡蛋卖给管家，把卖来的钱攒起来。她有做生意的天赋，有突出的聚财癖，不仅表现在贩卖鸡蛋和鸡方面，还表现在和园艺工就花茎、花籽和插枝的讨价还价上，里德太太曾吩咐园艺工，凡是伊丽莎想卖掉的花圃产品，他都得统统买下。而如果能卖个好价钱，伊丽莎连出售自己的头发也心甘情愿。至于所得的钱，起初她用破布或陈旧的卷发纸包好，藏在偏僻的角落里，但后来有几包被女佣发现了，她生怕有一天丢失她值钱的宝藏，只得同意由她母亲保管，但要收取近乎高利贷的利息——百分之五十或六十，一个季度收一次。她还把账记在一个小本子上，算得分毫不差。

乔治亚娜坐在一条高脚凳上，对着镜子梳理着自己的头发。她把一朵朵人造花和一根根退色的羽毛插到鬈发上，这些东西是她在阁楼上的一个抽屉里找到的。我正在铺床，因为根据贝茜的严格命令，我必须在她回来之前把一切都收拾好（贝茜现在常常把我当做育儿室女佣下手来使唤，吩咐我整理房间，擦椅子上的灰尘等等），我铺好被子，叠好睡衣后，走向窗台，正要把散乱的图画书和玩具放好，突然听到乔治亚娜命令我不许动她的玩具（因为这些椅子、镜子、小盘子和小杯子都是她的财产），我马上停手。一时无事可做，便开始往凝结在窗上的霜花上哈气，在玻璃上化开了一小块地方，透过它可以眺望外面的院落，那里的一切在严霜的威力之下，仿佛凝固似的寂然不动。

从窗口能望得见门房和马车道。我在蒙着一簇簇银白色霜花的窗玻璃上，正哈出一块可以往外窥视的地方时，只见大门开了，一辆马车驶了进来，我毫不在意地看着它爬上小道，因为尽管马车经常光临盖茨黑德府，却从来没有带来过一位我感兴趣的客人。这辆车在房子前面停下，门铃声响起，客人被请了进来，既然这种事情与我无关，我又被一种更有趣的景象吸引住了。那是一只饿坏了的小知更鸟，飞到紧贴靠窗的墙的一棵光秃秃的樱桃树枝上，唧唧喳喳叫个不停。我早餐吃剩的牛奶和面包就摆在桌子上，我把一小块面包弄碎，正推窗把碎屑放到窗台上时，贝茜跑上楼梯，走进了育儿室。

“简小姐，快把围裙脱掉。你在那儿干什么呀？今天早上洗脸、洗手了吗？”

我没有回答，又推了一下窗子，因为我要让这鸟儿万无一失地吃到面包。窗子终于松动了，我撒出了面包屑，有的落在石头窗边，有的落在樱桃树枝上。我把窗户关好后说：“没有，贝茜，我刚把屋子打扫完。”

“你这个粗心大意、难管的孩子！现在在干什么呢？看你满脸通红，好像干了什么坏事似的，你开窗干什么？”

贝茜似乎很着急，等不及听我解释，这省了我回答的麻烦。她一把把我拖到洗脸架前，不由分说往我脸上、手上擦了肥皂，洗了一遍，用一块粗糙的毛巾，虽然手脚很重但速度很快地擦完了我的脸。又用一把粗毛刷子，梳理了我的头发，脱下我的围裙，急急忙忙把我带到楼梯口，吩咐我立刻下楼去，说早餐室有人找我。

我想问她是谁在找我，还想问一问里德太太是不是也在那里。可是贝茜已经走了，育儿室的门在我身后关上。我只好慢慢地走下楼梯。近三个月来，里德太太从来没有叫过我。由于在育儿室里被禁闭了那么长时间，早餐室、餐厅和客厅都成了让我望而生畏的地方，我简直不敢进去。

现在，我站在空荡荡的大厅里，面前就是早餐室的门。我停住了脚步，吓得直发抖。在那些日子里，不公平的惩罚引起的恐惧使我变成了一个可怜的胆小鬼。我既不敢退回育儿室，又怕向前走向客厅。我焦虑不安、犹犹豫豫地站了十来分钟，直到早餐室一阵喧闹的铃声使我下定了决心：非进去不可了。

“谁会找我呢？”我心里有些纳闷，用两只手去转动僵硬的门把手，足有一两秒钟，那把手纹丝不动，“除了里德舅妈之外，我还会在客厅里见到谁呢？是男人还是女人？”把手转动了一下，门开了。我进去深深地行了一个屈膝礼，然后抬头一看——一根黑色的柱子！至少乍一看来是这样。一身黑色的衣服，一个直挺挺地站在壁炉前地毯上的笔直瘦长的高个子，上面那张冷漠无情的脸好像是雕刻的假面具被当做柱头安放在柱子身上。

里德太太坐在壁炉旁她平时坐的位置上，示意我走近她。我照着做了。她用这样的话把我介绍给那个毫无表情的陌生人：“这就是我向你提出申请的那个小女孩。”

他——因为是个男人——缓缓地把头转向我站立的地方，用他那双浓眉下满含探究目光的灰色眼睛审视着我，然后响起了他严肃的男低音：“她个子很小，几岁了？”

“十岁。”

“这么大了？”他有几分疑问地问道。然后又仔细打量了我几分钟，对我说：“你叫什么名字，小姑娘？”

“简·爱，先生。”

这时，我抬头看了他一眼，我觉得他是位身材高大的先生，不过，当时我实在是太矮小了。他的五官粗大，每个部位以及骨架上的每根线条，都是同样粗糙和刻板。

“哦，简·爱，你是个好孩子吗？”

我不可能回答说“是”，我那个小天地里的人都持有相反的意见，我只好保持沉默。里德太太意味深长地摇了一下头，等于替我做了回答，接着说：“这个话题也许还是少谈为妙，布罗克赫斯特先生。”

“很遗憾听你这么说，我必须和她谈一谈。”他弯下腰，坐在里德太太对面的扶手椅上，“过来。”他说。

我走过地毯，他让我笔直站在他面前，这时他的脸与我的几乎处在同一个水平面上，那是一张多怪的脸呀！多大的鼻子，多难看的嘴巴！还有那一口的大暴牙！

“没有比看到一个淘气孩子更让人丧气的了，”他开始说，“尤其是不听话的小姑娘。你知道坏人死后到哪里去吗？”

“他们下地狱。”我的回答既现成又正统。

“地狱是什么地方？能告诉我吗？”

“是个火坑。”

“你愿意落到那个火坑里，永远被火烧吗？”

“不愿意，先生。”

“那你怎样做才能避免呢？”

我认真地思考了一会儿，终于做出了不合时宜的回答：“我得保持健康，不要死掉。”

“你怎么才能保持健康呢？每天都有比你小的孩子死去。一两天前我还埋葬过一个只有五岁的孩子，一个好孩子，现在他的灵魂已经上了天，如果你被召唤去的话，恐怕很难说能同他一样了。”

我无法消除他的疑虑，便只好低下头去看他那双粘在地毯上的大脚，叹了一口气，巴不得自己离他远一些。

“但愿你的叹息是发自内心的，但愿你已经后悔不该给你的大恩人带来烦恼。”

“恩人！恩人！”我心里嘀咕着，“他们都说里德太太是我的恩人，如果真是这样的话，那么恩人真是个令人讨厌的东西了。”

“你每天早晚都做祷告吗？”我的询问者继续说。

“是的，先生。”

“你读《圣经》吗？”

“有时候读。”

“高兴读吗？你喜欢读吗？”

“我喜欢《启示录》、《但以理书》、《创世记》和《撒母耳记》，《出埃及记》的一小部分、《列王记》和《历代志》的几个部分，还有《约伯记》和《约拿书》。”

“还有《诗篇》呢？我想你也喜欢吧？”

“不喜欢，先生。”

“不喜欢？哎呀，真让人吃惊！有个小男孩，比你年纪还小，却能背六首赞美诗。如果你问他，是愿意吃一块姜饼呢，还是学一首赞美诗，他就会说：‘啊，学赞美诗吧！因为天使总是唱赞美诗。’还说：‘我真希望做一个人间的小天使。’他小小年纪就那么虔诚，为此他得到了两块姜饼作为奖赏。”

“赞美诗很乏味。”我说。

“这说明你心很坏，你应当祈求上帝给你换一颗新的纯洁的心，把那颗石头般的心取走，赐给你一颗血肉之心。”

我正要问他换心的手术怎样做时，里德太太插嘴了，吩咐我坐下来，然后谈起她自己的话题来。

“布罗克赫斯特先生，我相信三个星期以前我给你的信中曾经提到，这个小姑娘缺乏我所期望的人品与气质。如果你准许她进洛伍德学校，我乐意请校长和教师们对她严加看管，尤其要提防她身上最大的毛病——爱说谎。我当着你的面说这件事，简，目的是让你别再去欺骗布罗克赫斯特先生。”

我有理由害怕、讨厌里德太太，因为她生性就爱刻毒地伤害我，在她面前我永远不会快活。不管我怎样小心听话，千方百计讨她欢喜，我的努力仍然是白费，反而换来她上面说的那些话。她当着陌生人的面这样指责我，实在伤透了我的心。我依稀感到，她抹去了我对新生活所怀的希望，这种生活是她特意为我安排的。尽管我无法把这种感情表达出来，但我感到，她在我通向未来的道路上，播下了反感和无情的种子。我看到自己在布罗克赫斯特先生的眼睛里，已变成了一个工于心计、令人讨厌的孩子，我还能有什么办法来弥合这种伤痕呢？

“确实没有。”我一边想，一边竭力忍住哭泣，急忙擦掉几滴泪水，那是我极端痛苦的懦弱的表现。

“在孩子身上，说谎确实是一种可悲的缺点，”布罗克赫斯特先生说，“它近似于欺骗，而所有的说谎者，都会落到燃烧着硫黄烈火的湖里。不过，里德太太，我们会对她严加看管的，我会告诉坦普尔小姐和教师们的。”

“我希望能用和她将来前途适用的方式去培养她，”我的恩人继续说，“让她成为有用之才，永远保持谦卑。至于假期嘛，如果你允许的话，就让她在洛伍德过吧。”

“您的决定非常明智，太太。”布罗克赫斯特先生回答，“谦恭是基督教徒的美德，对洛伍德的学生尤其适用，所以我指示要特别注意在她们中间培养这种美德。我研究过如何最有效地克制她们世俗的傲慢情绪。而且，就在前几天得到了一个可喜的成功例证。我的第二个女儿奥古斯塔和她的妈妈一起访问了学校，一回来就感叹说：‘啊，亲爱的爸爸，洛伍德学校的姑娘都那么文静朴实！头发都梳在耳后，系长围裙，上衣外面还有一个亚麻布小口袋，她们简直就像穷人家的孩子！而且，’她说，‘她们都看着我和妈妈的穿着，好像从来没有看过丝绸衣服似的。’”

“这种情况我十分赞赏，”里德太太回答，“就是找遍整个英国，也很难找到一个更适合像简·爱这样孩子待的机构了。坚持不懈，亲爱的布罗克赫斯特先生，我主张干什么都要坚持不懈。”

“太太，坚持不懈是基督教徒的首要职责。它贯穿于洛伍德学校的一切安排之中：简单的饭菜，朴素的服装，简单的住宿，自觉吃苦耐劳的习惯。这就是这所学校和全校学生的生活准则。”

“您说得很对，先生。那我可以相信这个孩子已经被洛伍德学校收为学生，并在那里受到与她的地位和前途相称的教育了，是吗？”

“太太，您可以放心：她将被放在培植珍贵花草的苗圃里，我相信她会因为无比荣幸地被选中而心怀感激的。”

“既然这样，我会尽快送她去的，布罗克赫斯特先生，因为说实在的，我急于卸掉这副令人厌烦的担子呢。”

“的确，的确是这样，太太。现在我就向你告辞了。一两周之后我才回到布罗克赫斯特府去，我的好朋友一位副主教不肯让我早点离开。我会通知坦普尔小姐，一位新来的姑娘要到。这样，在接待方面就不会有什么困难了，再见。”

“再见，布罗克赫斯特先生。请向布罗克赫斯特太太和小姐、奥古斯塔、西奥多和布劳顿·布罗克赫斯特少爷问好。”

“我会的，太太。小姑娘，这里有本书叫《儿童指南》，你每次做完祷告后读一读，尤其要注意那个部分，说的是‘一个满口谎言、欺骗成性的孩子，玛莎·格××暴死的经过’。”

说完，布罗克赫斯特先生把一本装有封皮的薄薄小册子塞进我手里，接着打铃让人备好马车，离开了。

房间里只剩下了里德太太和我，在沉默中过了几分钟。她在做针线活，我在打量着她，当时里德太太也许只有三十六七岁，是个体魄健壮的女人，肩膀宽阔，四肢结实，个子不高，身体粗壮但并不肥胖，她的下颚很发达也很壮实，所以显得她的脸就有些大了。她的眉毛很低，下巴又大又突出，嘴巴和鼻子倒是十分匀称。在她浅色的眉毛下，闪动着一双缺乏同情心的眼睛。她的皮肤发黑，没有光泽，头发近乎亚麻色。她的体质很好，从不生病。她是一位精明能干的总管，家庭和租赁的产业都由她一手控制，只有她的孩子敢偶尔蔑视嘲笑她的权威。她穿着讲究，还有一种能衬托那些漂亮服饰的风度和举止。

我坐在离她的扶手椅几码远的一条矮凳上，打量着她的身材，仔细端详着她的五官。我手里拿着那本记述说谎者暴死经过的小册子，他们把这个故事作为一种恰当的警告要我特别注意。刚才发生的那一切，里德太太对布罗克赫斯特先生说的关于我的话，他们谈话的内容，仍在耳边回响，刺痛着我的心。每句话都听得明明白白，每句话都那么刺耳。一种怨恨之情在我的内心升起。

里德太太放下手头的活儿，抬起头来，目光与我的目光相遇，她的手指停止了灵巧的动作。

“出去，回到育儿室去。”她命令道。我的神情或者别的什么让她感觉受到了冒犯，因为她说话时尽管克制着，但仍然非常生气。我站起身来，走到门口，又走了回来，穿过房间走到窗口，一直走到她面前。

我一定要说，我一直受到别人的践踏，我必须反抗。可是怎么反抗呢，我用什么力量来回击对手呢？我鼓足勇气，直截了当地说：

“我不骗人，如果我骗人，我会说我爱你。但我声明，我不爱你，除了约翰·里德，你是世上我最不喜欢的人，这本写说谎者的书，你可以送给你的女儿乔治亚娜，因为爱说谎的是她，不是我。”

里德太太的手仍一动不动地放在她的活儿上，冰冷的目光，继续冷冷地注视着我。

“你还有什么话要说？”她问，那种口气与其说是平常对付孩子的，不如说是在对付一个成年的对手。

她的目光和语调，激起了我极大的反感，我激动得难以抑制，浑身发抖，继续说下去：

“我很庆幸你不是我的亲戚，今生今世我再也不会叫你舅妈了。长大了我也永远不会来看你，如果有人问我喜欢不喜欢你，你待我怎样，我会说，一想起你就使我感到厌恶，我会说，你对我残酷到了可耻的地步。”

“你怎么敢这么说，简·爱？”

“我怎么敢？里德太太，我怎么不敢？因为这是事实，你以为我没有情感，以为我不需要一点抚爱或亲情也可以活下去，可是我不能这样生活。还有，你没有怜悯之心，我会记住你怎么推我，粗暴地把我关进红房子，锁在里面，我到死都不会忘记，不管我有多痛苦，不管我泣不成声地说：‘放了我吧！放了我吧，里德舅妈！’还有你强加给我的惩罚。完全是因为你那可恶的坏孩子打了我，无缘无故把我打倒在地，我要把事情的经过，原原本本告诉每个问我的人。人们都以为你是个善良的女人，其实你很坏，铁石心肠。你自己才骗人呢！”

我还没有回答完，内心便已开始感到舒畅和喜悦了，那是一种前所未有的、奇怪的自由感和胜利感，就像无形的枷锁已被冲破，我似乎闯进了意外得到的自由的天地，这种情感不是没有原因的，因为里德太太看来是吓坏了，活儿从她的膝头滑落，她举起双手，身子前后摇晃着，甚至连脸都扭曲了，她好像要哭出来了。

“简，你搞错了，你怎么了？怎么抖得那么厉害？想喝水吗？”

“不，里德太太。”

“你想要别的什么吗？简，说实在的，我希望成为你的朋友。”

“你才不会呢。你对布罗克赫斯特先生说我品质恶劣、欺骗成性，可我要让洛伍德每个人都知道你是个什么样的人，都知道你干的好事。”

“简，这些事儿你不明白，孩子们有缺点应该得到纠正。”

“我没有骗人的缺点！”我发疯似的大叫着。

“但是你性子暴躁，简，这点你必须承认。现在回到育儿室去吧，乖孩子，去休息一会儿。”

“我不是你的乖孩子，我不休息，快点送我到学校去吧，里德太太，因为我讨厌住在这儿。”

“我真得早点送她去学校了。”里德太太低声喃喃着，收拾好针线活，突然离开了房间。

我——战场上的胜利者孤零零地站在那里。这是我经历的最艰难的一场战斗，也是我获得的第一次胜利。我在布罗克赫斯特先生站过的地毯上站了一会儿，享受着胜利者的孤独感。我先是暗自发笑，感到十分得意。但是这种狂喜犹如一时加快的脉搏会迅速递减一样，很快就消退了。一个孩子像我这样和长辈顶嘴，像我这样毫无顾忌地发泄自己的怒气，事后必定要感到悔恨和反作用带来的沮丧。我在责难和威胁里德太太时，内心好像一片点燃了的荒野，火光闪烁，来势凶猛，但经过半个小时的沉默和反思，深感自己行为的疯狂和自己恨人又被人嫉恨的处境的悲凉时，我内心的这片荒地，便已灰飞烟灭，留下的只有黑色的焦土了。

我第一次尝到了一点报复的滋味——犹如芬芳的美酒，刚喝下时觉得暖和香甜，但回味起来却又苦又涩，给我一种喝了毒药的感觉。现在，我很想去求得里德太太的宽恕，但经验和直觉告诉我，那只会使她以加倍的蔑视讨厌我，结果是再次激起我天性中爱爆发的冲动。

我愿意发挥比说话刻薄更高明的才能，也愿意培养比郁愤更好的情感。我取了一本阿拉伯故事书，坐下来很想看看，却全然不知所云，我的思绪飘忽在我自己与平日看得入迷的书页之间。我打开早餐室的玻璃门，只见灌木丛中一片沉寂，严霜依然覆盖着大地，没有一丝阳光也没有风。我撩起衣裙罩住头和胳膊，走出门去，漫步在一片僻静的树林里。但是沉寂的树木，落下的杉果，以及冰封了的秋天的遗物，被风聚成一堆堆如今又被冻结了的枯黄的树叶，都没有给我带来愉快。我倚在一扇大门上，凝望着空空的田野，那里没有觅食的羊群，只有冻坏了的苍白的浅草。这是一个灰蒙蒙的日子，天空一片混沌，偶尔飘下片片雪花，落在坚硬的小径和灰白的草地上，没有融化。我站立着，一副可怜巴巴的样子，一遍又一遍悄悄问自己说：“我该怎么办呢？我该怎么办呢？”

突然我听到一个清脆的声音叫道：“简小姐，你在哪儿？快来吃饭！”

是贝茜的声音，我很清楚，但是却一动没动，她沿着小径脚步轻快地走过来。

“你这个小淘气！”她说，“喊你你为什么不来？”

和刚才一直思考的那些事情相比，贝茜的到来是令人愉快的，尽管她和平常一样有些生气。其实，与里德太太发生冲突，并占了上风之后，我并没有把保姆一时的生气放在心上。我更想分享她那种年轻人轻松愉快的心情。我用胳膊搂着她说：“好啦，贝茜，别骂我了。”

这个动作比我平常的举动都要直率大胆，不知怎的，倒让贝茜高兴了。

“你真是个奇怪的孩子，简小姐。”她低头看着我，“一个喜欢独来独往的小东西。我想你要去上学了，是不是？”

我点了点头。

“离开可怜的贝茜，你不难过吗？”

“贝茜哪会把我放在心上？她老是骂我。”

“谁叫你是那么个古怪胆小又怕羞的小东西，你应该胆子大一点。”

“什么！要多挨几顿打吗？”

“胡说！不过你受了些虐待，这倒是事实。上个星期我母亲来看我的时候说，她不希望自己的哪一个小家伙处于你这样的位置——好啦，进去吧，我有个好消息告诉你。”

“我看你不会有的，贝茜。”

“孩子！你这是什么意思？你盯着我的那双眼睛多么忧郁啊！瞧！太太、小姐和约翰少爷今天下午都出去用茶点了，你可以跟我一起了。我会叫厨师给你烤个小蛋糕，然后你要帮我检查一下你的抽屉，因为我马上就要给你整理箱子了。太太想让你这一两天内离开盖茨黑德，你可以挑你喜欢的玩具带走。”

“贝茜，你得答应我，在我走之前不骂我了。”

“好吧，我答应你，不过别忘了，做个好孩子，而且也别怕我。如果我偶尔说话凶了一点，也别吓得哆嗦，那真让人恼火。”

“我想我不会怕你了，贝茜，因为我已经习惯了，很快我又有另外一些人要怕了。”

“如果你怕他们，他们会不喜欢你的。”

“像你一样吗，贝茜？”

“我并不是不喜欢你，小姐，我想，和其他人比起来，我更喜欢你。”

“不过你没有表现出来。”

“你这狡猾的小东西：你说话的口气不一样了，怎么会变得那么大胆和鲁莽呢？”

“呵，我不久就要离开你了，再说——”我正想谈谈我与里德太太之间发生的事，但又一想，还是不说为好。

“那么你是很高兴离开我了？”

“没有，贝茜，说真的，现在我心里有点儿难过。”

“‘现在’，‘有点儿’，我的小姐说得多么冷静！我想如果我现在要求你吻我一下，你是不会答应的，你会说，还是不要吧。”

“我吻你，而且我很愿意，把你的头低下来。”贝茜弯下了腰，我们相互拥抱着，我跟着她进了屋子。我们就在和谐平静的气氛中度过了那个下午。晚上，贝茜给我讲了几个最动人的故事，给我唱了几支她最动听的歌。甚至对我这样的人来说，生活中也还有几缕阳光呢。





第五章


一月十九日早晨，钟刚敲过五点，贝茜就端了蜡烛来到我的房间，看到我已经起床，衣服也几乎穿戴整齐了。其实在她进来之前半个小时，我就起床了。那时，半月正在下沉，月光从床边狭窄的窗户泻进房间，我借着月光洗了脸，穿好了衣服，那天我就要乘坐早晨六点钟经过院子门口的马车离开盖茨黑德。只有贝茜一个人起床了。她在育儿室里生了火，正在动手给我做早餐。孩子们想到出门总会兴奋不已，很少能吃得下饭，我也不例外，贝茜徒劳地劝我吃几口为我准备的热牛奶和面包，最后只得用纸包了些饼干，塞进了我的包里。接着她帮我穿上长外衣，戴好帽子，她自己也披上一个披肩，我们两个便离开了育儿室，经过里德太太卧室的时候，她说：“你要进去和太太告个别吗？”

“不啦，贝茜，昨天晚上你下楼去吃晚饭的时候，她到我的床边，说早晨不必吵醒她或者表兄妹们了，她还让我记住，她永远是我最好的朋友，说如果我以后这么谈起她她会万分感激的。”

“你是怎么说的呢，小姐？”

“我什么也没说，只是用床单蒙住脸，转过身去对着墙壁。”

“这可不对，简小姐。”

“我没有做错，贝茜。你的太太从来都不是我的朋友，她是我的敌人。”

“噢，简小姐！别这样说！”

“再见了，盖茨黑德！”穿过大厅走出前门时，我说。

月亮已经下沉，天空一片漆黑。贝茜提着灯，灯光闪烁在刚刚解冻而变得湿漉漉的台阶和砂石路上。冬天的清晨阴湿寒冷。我匆匆沿着车道走去，冻得牙齿直打冷战，门房的灯亮着。我们走到那儿时，只见他的妻子正在生火。前一天晚上我的箱子就已经被拿下楼，用绳子捆好放在了门边。这时离六点还差几分钟。不一会儿，钟响了，远处传来车轮声，说明马车已经驶来。我走到门口，看着车上的灯在黑暗中越来越近。

“她一个人走吗？”门房的妻子问道。

“是呀。”

“离这儿有多远？”

“五十英里。”

“那么远的路啊！真奇怪，里德太太怎么能放心让她一个人走那么远的路。”

马车停了下来，就在大门口，套着四匹马，顶座上坐满了乘客。车夫和管车人大声吆喝着催促快些上车，我的箱子被递了上去，当时我正搂着贝茜的脖子跟她连连亲吻呢。

“一定要好好照顾她呀。”管车人把我提起来放进车里时，贝茜对他说。

“行啊，行啊！”那人回答。车门关上了，“好啦”，一声吆喝，我们便上路了。就这样我告别了贝茜和盖茨黑德，就像一阵风似的被卷往陌生的、当时看来遥远而神秘的地方。

一路上的情形，我已经记不太清了。我只知道那一天对于我来说似乎特别长，好像是走了几百英里路似的。我们经过几个城镇，其中有一个很大，马车在那里停了下来。马匹被卸下，乘客们也下车吃点东西。我被带进一家客栈，管车人让我吃点饭，可是我却一点儿胃口也没有，于是他把我留在了一间大房间里。屋子的两头都有一个壁炉，天花板上挂着枝形吊灯，靠墙的高处有一个小小的红色陈列窗，里面放满了乐器。我在房间里来回走了很久，心里很不自在，害怕有人会进来把我拐走。我相信肯定有拐骗小孩的人，他们所干的勾当常常出现在贝茜在火炉旁所讲的故事中。管车人终于回来了，我再次被塞进车厢，我的保护人登上他的座位，吹起了瓮声瓮气的号角，车声辘辘地驶过L镇的“石头路”。

午后，天气潮湿，雾气蒙蒙。将近黄昏时，我开始感到离盖茨黑德真的很远了。我们不再经过城镇，乡村的景色也起了变化，一座座灰暗的大山耸立在地平线上。随着暮色渐浓，车子驶进一个山谷，这里长着一片树木。夜幕完全笼罩着周围的景色，之后很久，我听见狂风在林中呼啸。

那声音好像是催眠曲，我终于昏昏入睡了。没睡多久，车子突然停了下来，我被惊醒了。车门已经打开，一个仆人模样的人站在门边。我借着灯光看清了她的面容和穿着。

“这里有个叫简·爱的小姑娘吗？”她问。我回答说：“有。”然后被抱下了车，箱子也卸了下来，马车立即就驶走了。

因为坐得时间太长，我身子都僵硬了，马车的喧闹声和一路的颠簸弄得我迷迷糊糊。我定下神来，环顾左右，只见漫天的风雨，周围一片漆黑。不过我还是依稀看到面前有一堵墙，墙上有一扇门，我跟着我的新向导走进门去，她随手把门关上，锁好。这时可以看见一幢或者几幢房子——因为整座建筑物铺得很开——有很多窗子，其中有几扇透出灯光。我们走上一条宽阔的湿漉漉的石子路，又进了一扇门。接着仆人带我穿过一条过道，进了一个生着火的房间，把我一个人留下走了。

我站着在火上烤着冻僵了的手指，举目四顾，房间里没有蜡烛，不过，壁炉中摇曳的火光，不时地映出糊过壁纸的墙、地毯、窗帘、发亮的红木家具。这是一间客厅，虽没有盖茨黑德客厅宽敞华丽，却也十分舒适。我正迷惑地猜测墙上的一幅画的主题时，门开了，有一个人手里提着灯走了进来，还有一个人紧跟在后面。

走在前面的是一位高个子的女士，黑头发，黑眼睛，白皙宽大的额头。她半个身子裹在一条大披巾里，神情严肃，体态挺拔。

“这孩子这么小，真不该让她一个人来。”她说着，把蜡烛放在桌子上，仔细地打量了我一两分钟，随后补充道：

“还是早点送她上床吧，看来她累了。你累了吗？”她把手放在我肩上问道。

“有点累，小姐。”

“肯定也饿了。米勒小姐，让她上床前吃点晚饭。你是第一次离开父母来上学吗，我的小姑娘？”

我向她解释说我没有父母。她问我他们去世多久了，还问我的年龄，叫什么名字，会不会读写，会不会做一点儿缝纫，然后用食指轻轻摸了摸我的脸说，希望我是一个好孩子，说完便打发我与米勒小姐走了。

那位刚离开的小姐大约二十九岁，带我一起走的那位比她略小几岁。前者说话的声调、外表和神态都给了我很深的印象，而米勒小姐则比较一般，看上去显得有些疲倦，但面色却还红润，步态和行动显得十分匆忙，好像总有忙不完的事情。她看上去的确像一个助理教师，后来我发现果真如此，她领着我在一个形状不规则的大楼里，走过一个又一个房间，穿过一条又一条过道，这些地方都颇为寂静，甚至还有几分凄凉。终于听到嗡嗡的嘈杂的人声，走进了一个又宽又长的房间里，屋子两头各摆着两张大木板桌。每张桌子上点着两支蜡烛，一群年龄在九或十岁到二十岁之间的姑娘，围着桌子坐在长凳上。在昏暗的烛光下，我感到她们似乎多得难以计数，尽管实际上不会超过八十个。她们清一色地穿着式样古怪的棕色毛料罩衫，系着粗麻布长围裙。正是学习时间，她们正忙于默记明天的功课，我听到的嗡嗡声，原来是她们小声背书的声音。

米勒小姐示意我坐在门边的长凳上，随后走到这个长房间的尽头，大声叫道：

“班长们，把课本收起来，放到一边！”

四个高个子的姑娘分别从不同的桌子旁边站起来，转了一圈，把课本收集起来放好。米勒小姐再次发布命令：

“班长们，去把晚饭托盘端来！”

高个子姑娘们走了出去，很快又回来了，每人端了一个盘子，盘子里放着一份份分好了的东西，我不知道究竟是什么，中间是一大罐水和一只大杯子。那一份份的东西依次传递下去，谁想喝水就喝口水，那大杯子是公用的。轮到我的时候，因为口渴，我喝了点水，但没有去动食物，兴奋和疲倦使我胃口全无。不过，这时我看清楚了，那是一张薄薄的燕麦饼，被分成了几小块。

吃过晚饭，米勒小姐念了祷告，各班的姑娘两个一排地排队上楼了。这时我已经疲惫不堪，几乎没去注意寝室是什么样子，只知道它和教室一样长。今天晚上我和米勒小姐睡同一张床，她帮我脱掉衣服。我躺下以后看了看很长的一排排床铺，每张床上都很快地睡下了两个人，十分钟以后，仅有的一盏灯也熄灭了，在一片寂静和漆黑中，我沉沉睡去。

一夜很快过去了，我累得连梦也没有做，只醒了一次，听见狂风阵阵，大雨倾盆，还知道米勒小姐睡在我身边。等我再一次睁开眼睛时，听见响亮的铃声，姑娘们已经起床穿衣服了。天还没有亮，房间里燃着一两支灯芯草蜡烛，我也无可奈何地起床了。天气冷得刺骨，我打着哆嗦，勉强把衣服穿好，等脸盆空出来时洗脸。这并不容易等到，因为六个姑娘合用一个脸盆，摆在楼下房间正中的架子上。铃声再次响起，大家一排排站好了，列队走下楼梯，走进阴冷而烛光暗淡的教室里，米勒小姐念了祷告，接着，她大声喊道：

“按班级集中！”

接下来是几分钟的混乱，米勒小姐不断地喊道：“安静！”“遵守秩序！”喧闹声平息下来之后，我看到她们排成了四个半圆形，分别面对着四张桌子后面的四把椅子，每人手里都拿着书。桌子上各有一部《圣经》似的大书，放在空着的座位上。几秒钟的安静之后，响起了低沉而含糊的嗡嗡声。米勒小姐从一个班走到另一个班，把这种模糊的闹声压下去。

远处传来了叮咚的铃声，立刻有三位小姐进了房间，分别走向一张桌子，在椅子上坐下来。米勒小姐坐在了靠门最近的第四把空椅子上，椅子周围是一群年龄最小的孩子，我被叫到了这个低级班，安排在最末的位置。

现在一天的功课开始了：反复诵读当天的祈祷以后，接着读了几篇经文，最后是慢声朗读《圣经》的章节，这用了一个小时的时间。等到这些功课做完，天色已经大亮，不知疲倦的钟声第四次响起，各个班级列队走进另一个房间去吃早饭。想到马上有东西吃，我多么高兴啊！前一天吃得太少，这时我简直饿坏了。

饭厅是一个光线昏暗的大房间，天花板很低；两张长桌上放着两大盆热气腾腾的东西。但令人失望的是，散发出来的气味却并不诱人，我发现，被叫来吃这种食物的人，鼻子中闻到了这种气味时，都露出不满的表情。站在最前面的第一班的高个子姑娘们开始窃窃私语：

“真讨厌，粥又煮糊了！”

“安静！”突然有人喊了一声。说话的不是米勒小姐，而是一个高级教师。她身材矮小、皮肤黝黑、穿着漂亮，但是脸色有些阴沉。她站在桌子上手，坐在另一张桌子上手的是一位体态丰满的女士。我想找头一天晚上见过的那位小姐，但是没有找到，米勒小姐坐在我坐着的那张桌子的下手。而一位看上去很怪、颇像外国人的年长妇女，坐在另外一张餐桌的下手，后来才知道她是法语教师。大家做了一个长长的感恩祷告，唱了一首赞美歌，然后一个仆人给教师们送来了茶点，早餐就这样开始了。

我饿极了，现在已经头昏眼花了，便把自己那份粥吞下了一两调羹，也顾不上是什么滋味。但是最初的饥饿感一消失，我便发觉手里拿着的东西令人作呕，烧焦的粥与烂马铃薯一样糟糕，连饥饿本身也很快厌恶起它来。汤匙在各人手里缓慢地移动着，我看见每个姑娘尝了尝自己的食物，竭力想把它咽下去，可是大多立刻放弃了这种努力。早餐时间结束了，可是谁也没有吃。我们做了感恩祷告，对我们实际没有得到的东西表示感恩，还唱了第二首赞美诗，接着便离开餐厅到教室去。我是走在最后的一个，经过餐桌时，看见一位教师端起一碗粥尝了尝。她看了看其他人，她们脸上都露出了不快的神色，其中的一个，就是体态较丰满的那位说：

“多难吃的东西！真丢脸！”

一刻钟以后才开始上课。在这一刻钟里，教室里沸沸扬扬，乱作一团。在这段时间里，似乎允许自由地大声说话，大家都利用了自己的这份特权。整个谈话的内容都围绕着早餐，都狠狠骂了一通。可怜的人啊！这就是她们仅有的安慰。此刻米勒小姐是教室里唯一的一位教师，一群大姑娘围着她，严肃愤怒地做着手势和她说话。我听见有人提到了布罗克赫斯特先生的名字，米勒小姐听见了，不以为然地摇了摇头；但她无意去遏制这种普遍的愤怒，无疑她自己也在生气。

教室里的钟敲了九点，米勒小姐离开了她的圈子，站到房间中间，喊道：

“安静，回到自己的座位上去！”

纪律占了上风，不到五分钟，乱哄哄的人群就秩序井然了。相对的安静平息了嘈杂的喧闹。高级教师们都准时就位，不过似乎所有的人都在等待着。八十个姑娘坐在屋子两边的长凳上，坐得笔直，一动也不动。她们好像是一群聚集在一起的古怪人物，头发都平直地向后梳着，看不见一绺鬈发。穿的是褐色衣服，领口很高，颈部还围着一个窄窄的领布，罩衣前胸都系着一个亚麻布口袋（样子有点像苏格兰高地人的钱包），用做工作口袋，所有的人都穿着羊毛长袜和乡下人做的鞋子，鞋上装着铜扣。二十多位这身打扮的人都已经是成熟的大姑娘了，或者说是年轻的妇人了。这身打扮对她们很不合适，即使是最漂亮的姑娘看上去也很古怪。

我还在打量着她们，偶尔也审视一下教师们——确切地说没有一个看着顺眼的。身体健壮的那一个有点粗俗；黑的那个看起来很凶；那位外国人严厉而怪僻；而米勒小姐呢，可怜的人，她脸色发紫，一副饱经风霜、劳累过度的样子——当我的目光正从一张张脸上移开时，全校学生仿佛被同一个弹簧带动起来似的，同时站起来。

发生什么事情了？我没听到有人下命令啊，真是奇怪。我还没有定下神来，全体已经坐下了；既然所有人的目光都转向了那一点，我也就跟着看过去，看到的是昨天晚上接待我的那个人，她站在长长教室顶端的壁炉旁边，教室两头都生了火，她神情严肃地默默审视着站成两排的姑娘们。米勒小姐走近她，好像问了一个问题，得到回答后，又回到原来的地方，大声说道：

“一班班长，把地球仪拿来！”

这个命令正在执行时，米勒小姐刚才请示过的那位女士慢慢地从房间的一头走过来。我想我身上肯定有一种相当发达的崇敬的器官，因为至今我仍保存着当时目光紧随着她的脚步时的那种敬仰之情。当时，在大白天，她看上去修长、美丽、身材匀称，棕色的眸子透出慈祥的目光，细长如画的睫毛、白皙的宽额头，深棕色的鬓发照时尚梳成圆圆的发卷，那时光滑的发辫和长长的鬈发还没有流行。她的服装也很时髦，紫色的布料，衬上一种黑丝绒的西班牙饰边。一只金表（当时手表不像现在这么普遍）在她腰带上闪光。要使这幅画像更加完整，还请读者再加上秀丽的容貌、略显苍白却十分明净的肤色以及端庄的仪态。至少在文字所能表达清楚的范围内有了一个坦普尔小姐外表的正确概念，也就是玛丽亚·坦普尔。这个名字，是我后来有一次替她带一本祈祷书到教堂去时看到上面她的签名时才知道她的全名的。

这位洛伍德学校的校长（也就是这位女士的职务）在放在一张桌上的两个地球仪前面坐了下来，把第一班的人叫到她身边，开始上地理课。较低的几个班级被其他几个教师叫走，背诵历史、语法等等，这持续了一个小时。接着是写作和数学，坦普尔小姐还给大一点的姑娘上了音乐课，每节课的时间都是按钟点计算的。钟终于敲响了十二点，校长站了起来。

“我有话要对同学们说。”她说。

下课时的喧闹本来已经开始，可是听到她的话又安静了下来，她继续说：

“今天早晨的饭，大家都吃不下去，一定饿坏了，我已经吩咐给大家准备了面包和乳酪当点心。”

教师们都吃惊地看着她。

“此事由我负责。”她带着解释的口气向她们补充了一句，接着很快地离开了教室。

面包和乳酪立刻端了进来，分发给大家，全校学生无不欢欣鼓舞，精神振奋。这时来了命令，“到花园里去！”每个人都戴上一个粗糙的草帽，帽子上系着用染过的白布做成的带子，还披上了灰色的粗绒斗篷。我也是同样的打扮，随着人流走向户外。

花园是一大片圈起来的场地，四周围墙高耸，看不到外面的景色。花园的一边有一条带顶的游廊，几条宽阔的通道围着中间的一块地，这块地被分割成几十个小花坛，分配给学生们培植花草，每个花坛都有一个主人。百花盛开的时候，这些花坛肯定非常美丽，但是现在是一月底，一片冬日枯黄凋零的景象。我站在那儿，环顾四周，不觉打了个寒噤。这天的户外活动时间内，并没有下雨，不过迷蒙的雾霭让天色一片阴沉；脚下的地面由于昨天的大雨依然潮湿，身体比较健壮的几位姑娘跑来跑去，活泼地做起了游戏，但苍白瘦弱的姑娘们都挤在走廊这个温暖的藏身之处。浓雾渗进了她们颤抖着的身体，我不时听见一声声干咳。

我没有和别人说过话，似乎也没有人注意到我。我孤零零地站着，不过已经习惯于这种孤独感，并不觉得十分压抑，我倚在走廊的柱子上，拉着灰色的斗篷紧紧地裹住自己，竭力忘记身外刺骨的严寒，忘记肚子里折磨着我的饥饿，集中全部精力去观察和思考。我的思索过于凌乱含糊，不值一记。我几乎不知道自己身在何处。盖茨黑德和往昔的生活似乎已经逝去，眼前的一切模糊而陌生，将来的一切更是无法预测。我看了看四周修道院一般的花园，又抬头看了看校舍。大楼一半似乎灰暗古旧，另一半却很新。新的一半里安排了教室和寝室，由于装上了直棂的格子窗，光线很好，看上去有点像教堂。门上有一块石头牌子，刻有这样的文字：





洛伍德慈善学校——该部分由本郡布罗克赫斯特府的内奥米·布罗克赫斯特重建于公元××××年。





“你们的光也当这样照在人前，叫他们看见你们的好行为，便将荣耀归给你们在天上的父。”——《马太福音》第5章第16节。





我反复读着这些文字，觉得它们肯定有某种解释，但还无法完全理解其中的内涵。我正在思索“慈善学校”一词的含义，竭力要找出第一句话与经文之间的联系，听见身后有人咳嗽，便回过头去，看到一个姑娘坐在附近的石凳上，正低头聚精会神地看书。从我站着的地方可以看到书名是《拉塞拉斯》[1]。这个看起来很特别的书名吸引了我。她翻书页的时候，碰巧抬起头来，我直截了当地对她说：

“你的书有趣吗？”我已经打算哪一天向她借书读一读。

“我很喜欢。”她打量了我一两秒钟以后才回答。

“它讲的什么？”我继续问。我自己也不知道哪里来的勇气，去和一个陌生人说起话来。这不符合我的天性和习惯，不过也许是她的专注打动了我，因为我也喜欢读书，尽管是肤浅幼稚的一类。对那些主题严肃、内容充实的书，我是无法消化和理解的。

“你可以看看。”女孩一边回答一边把书递给了我。

我看了看，只匆匆一翻，我就深信，书的内容不像书名那么有吸引力。《拉塞拉斯》对我不足称道的口味来说太枯燥了，没有仙女，没有妖怪，密密麻麻印着字的书页中连彩色的图画也没有。我把书还给她，她默默地接过去，什么也没有说，又要像刚才一样专心地去读时，我再次冒昧地打扰了她：

“你能告诉我，门上那块石匾上的字是什么意思吗？洛伍德学校是什么？”

“就是你来住宿的这所房子。”

“他们为什么叫它‘慈善学校’呢？与别的学校有什么不同吗？”

“这是一个半慈善性质的学校，你、我还有所有其他人都是慈善学校的孩子。我想你也是个孤儿，不是父亲去世了，就是母亲去世了。”

“在我记事之前他们就都去世了。”

“是啊，这里的姑娘们不是没有父亲就是没有母亲，或者是父母亲都没有了，这儿是教育孤儿的学校。”

“我们不付钱吗？他们免费养活我们吗？”

“我们自己付钱，或者我们的朋友付，每年十五英镑。”

“那他们为什么叫我们慈善学校的孩子？”

“因为十五英镑不够付住宿费和学费，不足的钱靠捐款来补足。”

“谁捐的款呢？”

“这儿附近或者伦敦好心肠的太太绅士们。”

“内奥米·布罗克赫斯特是谁？”

“就像石板上写着的那样，那位盖大楼新区的太太，这里所有的一切都由她的儿子监督指挥。”

“为什么？”

“因为他是这个学校的司库和管事。”

“这么说这幢大楼不属于那位戴着手表、告诉我们可以吃面包和乳酪的高个子女士了？”

“属于坦普尔小姐？啊，不是！真希望是属于她的。她所做的一切都要对布罗克赫斯特先生负责，我们吃的和穿的都是布罗克赫斯特先生买的。”

“他住在这儿吗？”

“不——在两英里以外，一个大庄园里。”

“他是个好人吗？”

“他是个牧师，据说做了很多好事。”

“你说那位高个子女士叫坦普尔小姐？”

“是啊。”

“其他教师的名字叫什么？”

“脸颊红红的那个叫史密斯小姐，她负责劳动，还有裁剪——因为我们自己缝自己的衣服、罩衣、外衣，所有一切。那个黑头发、个子矮小的是斯卡查德小姐，她教历史、文法，还负责二班的背诵。那位围着披巾、腰里用黄丝带系着一块手帕的是皮埃罗太太，她来自法国里尔，教法语。”

“你喜欢这些教师吗？”

“很喜欢。”

“你喜欢那个黑黑的小个子和——那个太太吗？——我没法把她的名字读成像你读的那样。”

“斯卡查德小姐脾气急躁，你要小心别惹她生气；皮埃罗太太倒是不坏。”

“不过坦普尔小姐最好，是不是？”

“坦普尔小姐非常好，非常聪明，她比别人都强，因为她懂得比她们要多很多。”

“你来这儿很长时间了吗？”

“两年了。”

“你是孤儿吗？”

“我母亲死了。”

“你在这儿快乐吗？”

“你的问题太多了。我已经回答你很多问题了，现在我想看书了。”

但是这时候吃饭铃响了，大家回到屋里。弥漫在餐厅里的气味并不比早餐时我们闻到的更诱人。饭菜盛在两个大白铁桶里，热腾腾一股腐肉的气味。我发现这堆东西是把一些烂土豆和变质的腐肉搅在一起煮成的，每个学生都分到满满的一盘。我把能吃的都吃了，心里暗自纳闷，是不是每天的饭食都是这样？

午饭以后，我们立刻又去了教室，开始上课，一直到下午五点钟。

下午唯一值得一提的是，我看到了在走廊上和我交谈的女孩被斯卡查德小姐赶出历史课堂，罚站在大教室中央。在我看来，这种惩罚实在是太丢脸了，尤其是对像她这么大的姑娘来说——她看上去有十三岁了，或许更大一些，我以为她会露出伤心和羞耻的表情。但使我吃惊的是，她既没有哭，也没有脸红，她在众目睽睽之下，站在那里，虽然神情严峻，却非常镇定。“她怎么能那么默默而又坚定地忍受呢？”我心里想着，“换作是我，我肯定希望脚下会裂一道缝把我吞下去。而她看上去仿佛在想惩罚之外的什么事，而不是她的处境，是某种与眼前或周围无关的事。我听说过白日梦，难道她在做白日梦？她的眼睛盯着地板，但可以肯定她视而不见，她的目光似乎是向内的，直视自己的心灵。我相信，她注视的是自己记忆中的事情，而不是眼前实实在在的东西。我不明白她是哪种类型的女孩——是好女孩呢，还是一个淘气的女孩？”

下午五点钟刚过，我们又吃了一餐，是一小杯咖啡和半片黑面包。我狼吞虎咽地吃了面包，喝了咖啡；不过如果能再多一点的话，我会很高兴的——我仍然很饿。接下来是半小时的娱乐活动，然后是学习，再后来是一杯水，一个燕麦饼，祈祷，上床，这就是我在洛伍德的第一天。

第六章


第二天开始了，和第一天一样，借着灯芯草蜡烛的微光，穿衣起床，不过今天早晨不得不放弃洗脸这个仪式了，因为罐里的水都结了冰。从昨天傍晚起，天气变了，刺骨的东北风，透过寝室窗子的缝隙，彻夜呼呼地吹着，我们在床上直打哆嗦，罐子里的水也都冻成了冰。

冗长的一个半小时的祷告和《圣经》诵读还没有结束，我就已经觉得快要冻死了。早餐的时间终于到了，而且今天的粥没有烧焦，还能下咽，只可惜量太少。我的那份看上去真少呀！真希望能吃双份。

在这一天，我被编入第四班，老师还给我布置了正规的功课和作业。在此之前，我一直是一个旁观者，看着洛伍德的各项活动，而现在自己也成了其中的一员了。最初，由于我不习惯于背诵，觉得课文又长又难，功课一门门不断变换，弄得我头昏脑涨。大约下午三点钟，史密斯小姐把一根两码长的细布滚边塞到我手里，还有针和顶针之类的东西，让我坐在教室一个安静的角落里，按照吩咐缝滚边，我很高兴。那时，别人也大都和我一样在做针线活儿，不过还有一个班仍围着斯卡查德小姐的椅子，站着读书。因为四周都很安静，所以能听得见她们功课的内容，也听得见每个姑娘读得怎样，听得见斯卡查德小姐听完以后对她们的责备和表扬。这是一堂英国历史课，我注意到在读书的人中，有一位是我在走廊上相识的。开始上课时，她被安排在全班的首位，可是由于某些发音错误或者是忽视了标点，她突然被降到全班的末尾去了。即使到了这种不引人注意的位置上，斯卡查德小姐也继续使她成为始终引人注意的对象，不断地向她说出这样的话来：

“彭斯（这似乎是她的姓，这儿的女孩们和其他地方的男孩一样，都是用姓来称呼的），彭斯，你把鞋子踩偏了，快把脚趾伸直。”“彭斯，你伸着下巴，难看死了，快收回去。”“彭斯，我要你抬起头来，我不允许你这样站在我面前。”诸如此类。

一章书从头到尾读了两遍，课本便合了起来，开始对姑娘们进行测试。这堂课讲的是查理一世[1]王朝的一个时期，问了各种关于船舶港税和造舰税的问题。大多数姑娘似乎都答不上来，可是每道题似乎一到彭斯那里，都会迎刃而解的。她像已经把整堂课的内容都记在脑子里了，任何问题都能对答如流。我一直以为斯卡查德小姐要称赞她专心致志了，谁知她突然大叫起来：

“你这肮脏讨厌的丫头！你早上一定没洗指甲！”

彭斯没有回答，我对她的沉默感到诧异。

“她为什么不解释，”我想，“水结冻了，所以无法洗脸和指甲。”

此时，史密斯小姐转移了我的注意力，她让我替她撑住一束线，一面绕，一面不时跟我说话。问我以前是否进过学校，会不会绣花、缝纫、编织等，直到她打发我走，我才有可能进一步观察斯卡查德小姐的行动。正在我回到自己的座位上时，她发布了一道命令，命令的内容我没有听清楚。但是只见彭斯立刻离开了班级，走进里面一个放书的小间，隔了半分钟后又返了回来，手里拿着一束一头扎好的小树枝。她毕恭毕敬地行了个屈膝礼，把这个不祥的刑具交给了斯卡查德小姐。接着，她不用吩咐，便默默地解开了自己的围裙，这位教师立刻用这束小树枝狠狠地在她脖子上抽了十几下，彭斯没有掉一滴眼泪。看见这种情景，我心里不由得涌起了一种气愤却又无可奈何的感觉，连手指都颤抖起来，手中的针线活儿也不得不停下来。而她那张沉思的脸上，却依然是平日的表情，一点也没有改变。

“顽固不化的丫头！”斯卡查德小姐嚷道，“什么都改不掉你那邋遢的习惯，把木条拿走。”

彭斯听从吩咐。她从藏书室里出来时，我仔细打量了她一下，她正把手帕放回她的口袋，瘦瘦的脸颊上闪着泪痕。

在洛伍德，傍晚的游戏时间是一天中我觉得仅有的一点儿愉快的时光。下午五点钟大口吞下的一小块面包和几口咖啡，虽然不能消除饥饿感，却让人恢复了活力。一整天的紧张拘束也放松了，教室里比早上要暖和，因为允许把炉火生得更旺一些，以便多少可以代替尚未点燃的蜡烛。红彤彤的火光、放肆的喧闹、嘈杂的人声，给人以一种受欢迎的自由感。

在我看见斯卡查德小姐鞭打她的学生彭斯的那天晚上，我和原来一样，徘徊在长凳、桌子和笑声不绝的人群中间，虽然无人做伴，倒也并不觉得寂寞。经过窗口时，我不时地拉起百叶窗，向外眺望。大雪纷飞，下端的窗玻璃上已经积起了一层积雪，我把耳朵贴近窗子，可以在屋内的欢声笑语中分辨出外面寒风凄厉的哀号。

如果我刚离开了一个温暖的家和慈祥的双亲，这一时刻也许会引起我离别的哀愁。因为外面的风声使我心情哀伤，里面这杂乱的人声会搅乱我的平静；但实际上两者激起了我一种奇怪的激动，在不安和狂热之中，我盼望风会咆哮得更猛烈，天色会更浓到一片漆黑，嗡嗡的人声进而变成喧嚣。

我跳过凳子钻过桌子，来到一个壁炉前，我发现彭斯正跪在高高的铁丝防护板旁边，借着余烬灰暗的火光在全神贯注地默默地读着一本书，似乎忘掉了周围的一切。

“还是那本《拉塞拉斯》吗？”我来到她背后，问道。

“是的，”她说，“我刚读完它。”

过了五分钟她合上了书，我很高兴。

现在，我想，我也许能让她开口说话吧。我挨着她，坐在了地板上。

“你姓彭斯，那你叫什么名字呢？”

“海伦。”

“你从很远的地方来吗？”

“我是从靠北一点的地方来的，那儿靠近苏格兰边境了。”

“你还回去吗？”

“我希望能这样，可是将来的事谁也说不准。”

“你一定很希望离开洛伍德，是吗？”

“不，干吗要这样呢？我是被送到洛伍德来接受教育的，没有达到这个目的就离开有什么意义呢？”

“可是那个教师，就是斯卡查德小姐，对你那么凶。”

“凶？一点也没有！她很严格，她不喜欢我的缺点。”

“如果我是你，我会讨厌她的，我会反抗。如果她用那束小树枝打我的话，我会从她手里夺过来，当着她的面把它折断。”

“也许你根本不会干那种事。但是如果你真做了，布罗克赫斯特先生会把你撵出学校的，那会使你的亲戚感到难过。耐心忍受只有自己感到的痛苦，远比冒失的行动影响到所有和你有关的人要好，更何况，《圣经》上告诉我们要以德报怨。”

“可是挨鞭子，在满屋子都是人的房间中被罚站，毕竟是丢脸的呀！而且你已经是那么大的姑娘了，我比你小得多还受不了呢。”

“不过，如果无法避免，那你的职责就是忍受。如命里注定该你忍受的事情，你忍受不了，那就是软弱和愚蠢。”

我听着她的话感觉特别吃惊。我无法理解这“忍受”的信条，更无法明白或同情她对惩罚者所表现出的宽容。不过我仍觉得海伦·彭斯是凭借一种我所看不见的光来考虑事情的，我怀疑也许她是对的，而我是错的。但是我对这事不想再去深究，像费利克斯[2]一样，我将它推迟到以后方便的时候再去考虑。

“你说你有缺点，海伦，什么缺点？我觉得你很好。”

“那你就听我说吧，不要以貌取人，像斯卡查德小姐说的那样，我很邋遢，我很少把东西整理得整整齐齐的。我很粗心，总是忘掉规则，该做功课的时候却在看书。我做事情缺乏条理，有时候我也像你一样会说，我受不了这种井井有条的安排。这些都让斯卡查德小姐很恼火，她天生讲究整洁，遵守时间，一丝不苟。”

“而且凶狠暴躁。”我补充了一句，但海伦不同意我的补充，她依然沉默不语。

“坦普尔小姐对你和斯卡查德小姐一样严厉吗？”

一提到坦普尔小姐的名字，她严肃的脸上便掠过了一丝温柔的微笑。

“坦普尔小姐非常善良，不忍心严厉对待任何人，即使是学校里最差的学生。她看到我的错误，会和颜悦色地向我指出。如果我做了值得称赞的事情，她就慷慨地表扬我。我的天性坏到了可悲地步的一个有力证据就是，尽管她的规劝那么恰到好处，那么合情合理，却依旧没有治好我的那些毛病。甚至她的赞扬，虽然我很珍视，却无法激励我经常保持小心谨慎，考虑周到。”

“这真是奇怪，”我说，“要做到小心多么容易啊。”

“对于你说来，无疑是这样。早上我仔细观察了你上课时的情形，发现你非常专心。米勒小姐讲解功课，问你问题时，你思想从不开小差。而我却总是心不在焉，在我本该听斯卡查德小姐讲课，应该用心把她讲的记住时，我却常常连她说话的声音都听不见了，我好像是进入了梦境。有时我以为自己在诺森伯兰[3]，以为周围的声音是我家附近流过‘深谷’的那条小溪潺潺的水声——所以轮到我回答问题时，就得先把我叫醒。而因为刚才是在听幻想中的溪流声，现实中其实什么也没有听到，我也就回答不上来了。”

“可是你今天下午回答得多好呀！”

“那只是碰巧，因为我对我们读的内容很感兴趣，今天下午我没有梦游‘深谷’，反而一直在纳闷，一个像查理一世那样一心要做好事的人，怎么有时会干出那么极不公平的蠢事来，我想真可惜，那么正直真诚的人竟看不到皇权以外的东西。如果他的目光能看得远一些，看清了所谓时代精神的走向该有多好！尽管这样，我还是喜欢查理一世，我尊敬他，同情他，可怜的被谋杀的皇帝。是的，他的仇敌最坏了，他们让他们没有权利伤害的人流了血，他们竟敢杀了他！”

此刻海伦是在自言自语了，她忘了我听不太懂她的话，忘了我对她谈论的话题一无所知，或者说是几乎一无所知。我把她重新拉回到我的水平上来。

“那么坦普尔小姐上课的时候，你也走神吗？”

“当然不是，不常这样。因为坦普尔小姐总是有比我的想法更富有新意的东西要说，她的语言我也特别喜欢，她所传授的知识常常正好是我所希望获得的。”

“这么说，你在坦普尔小姐面前表现很好喽？”

“是的，是出于被动。我并非有意那样，只是顺其自然而已，这种表现好像也没有什么了不起。”

“挺了不起的，别人待你好，你也待别人好，这就是我一直希望做的。如果人们对于那些冷酷无情的人总是和和气气、唯唯诺诺的话，那些坏人就会为所欲为，他们会有恃无恐，永远也不会改变，只会愈来愈坏。如果我们无缘无故地挨打，我们就要狠狠地回击，我坚信我们应该这样，狠狠地教训那个打我们的人，让他以后再也不敢动手了。”

“我想，等你长大了你的想法会改变的，现在你还是一个没有受过教育的小姑娘。”

“可我总觉得，海伦，那些不管我怎样讨好他们、还是讨厌我的人，我也讨厌他们，我必须反抗那些不讲道理地惩罚我的人。这就像我爱那些爱护我的人，或者是情愿接受我认为自己该受的惩罚一样，是很自然的事情。”

“那是异教徒和野蛮民族的信条，基督教徒和文明的民族不觉得这有什么道理。”

“怎么会呢？我不懂。”

“暴力不是消除仇恨的最好办法——同样，报复也绝对医治不了伤害。”

“那什么能呢？”

“读一读《新约全书》，看一看基督的言行，把他的话作为你的规范，他的行为作为你的榜样。”

“他是怎么说的？”

“你们的仇敌要爱他，诅咒你们的要为他祝福，恨你们、凌辱你们的要待他好。”[4]

“那我应当爱里德太太了，这我可做不到；我应当祝福她的儿子约翰了，但那根本不可能。”

这回轮到海伦·彭斯要我解释明白了，我便按照自己的想法尽情地倾诉了我所受的苦和自己心中的怨恨。心里一激动，说话便尖酸刻薄起来，但是我怎么想的就怎么说，毫无保留，语气也不委婉。

海伦耐心地听完了我的话，我以为她会发表点感想，但是她什么也没有说。

“那么，”我耐不住终于问，“难道里德太太不是一个冷酷无情的坏女人吗？”

“毫无疑问，她对你不客气。因为你瞧，她讨厌你的性格，就像斯卡查德小姐不喜欢我的性格一样，但是，你把她对你说过的和做过的记得那么清楚！她的不公好像已经在你心里留下了深刻的印记！可是无论我受过什么样的虐待，都不会在我的心里烙下这样的印记。如果你忘掉她对你的严厉，忘掉由此而引起的愤怒，你不是会更愉快一些吗？对于我来说，生命似乎太短暂了，不应用来结仇和记恨。我们生活在世间，人人都难免有过失，而且必定如此，但我相信，很快就会有这么一天，我们在摆脱腐坏躯体的同时，也会摆脱这些罪过。到那时，堕落与罪过将会随同累赘的肉体一起离开我们，只留下精神的火花——生命和思想的本源，它像当初离开上帝使万物具有生命时那么纯洁，它从哪里来就回到哪里去，也许又会被传递给比人类更高级的东西——也许会一步步地经过荣耀的各个等级，从人灰暗苍白的灵魂，变亮成为最高级的炽天使[5]。相反它绝不会允许从人类堕落成魔鬼，是吧？是的，我不相信会这样。我持有另一种信条，这种信条没有人教过我，我也很少对人提起，但我为此感到愉快，我对它坚信不渝，因为它给所有的人都带来了希望。它使永恒成为一个安息处，一个宏伟的家，而不是恐惧的深渊。而且，有了这个信条，我能够清楚地把罪犯和他所犯的罪区别开来，我可以真诚地宽恕前者，而对后者无比憎恶，有了这个信条，报复心永远也不会来扰乱我，凌辱永远不会过分深恶痛绝，不公平不会把我完全压倒，我平静地生活，期待着末日的到来。”

海伦的头一直低垂着，她向来喜欢如此说完最后一句时垂得更低了。从她的神态上我知道她不想再和我谈下去了，而宁愿与自己的思想交流。她也没有能沉思多长时间，不一会儿，一位班长，一个高大粗鲁的姑娘，带着很重的昆布兰[6]口音叫道：

“海伦·彭斯，如果现在你不去整理抽屉，收拾你的针线活儿，我就要告诉斯卡查德小姐，请她来看看。”

海伦的幻想消散了，她叹了口气，站起来，没有耽搁，默默地服从了班长的命令。

第七章


在洛伍德度过的第一个季度似乎有一个时代那么长，而且并不是黄金时代；在这一个季度里，我得做种种令人生厌的斗争，来克服困难，适应新的规矩和陌生的工作。我一直担心在这方面出错，生怕在这些方面受挫的心情，比起我命里注定身体上要承受的艰苦来，更让我苦恼，尽管后者也不是轻松的小事。

在一月、二月还有三月的部分日子里，雪一直积得很厚，一旦融化，道路就几乎无法通行，我们除了去教堂活动以外，便被困在花园的围墙之内了。可是在这个范围内，我们还是要每天在户外度过一小时。我们身上的衣服不足以抵抗寒冷。我们没有长靴，雪灌进鞋子里，并在里面融化。我们没有手套，手都冻僵了，像脚上一样，长满了冻疮。我现在仍然记忆犹新，我的双脚红肿，每天晚上都痛痒难忍，每天早上还要把肿痛僵硬的脚塞进鞋子里。食品的供应不足也令人沮丧，我们这些孩子都正是长身体的年龄，食欲旺盛，可吃的东西连维持一个虚弱的病人都不够。营养不足造成了不良习气，这就害苦了年纪较小的学生。饥肠辘辘的大姑娘们只要一有机会，就或是哄骗或是威吓，把年龄较小的姑娘们的那一份拿走。有很多次，我曾把午后茶点时分得的那一口珍贵的黑面包分给两位勒索者，把我那杯咖啡的一半给了第三个勒索者，自己一边因为饥饿流着眼泪，一边咽下剩下的一半。

在那个寒冷的季节里，星期日是个沉闷的日子。我们得走上两英里路，到布洛克尔桥教堂去，我们的保护人在那儿做礼拜。出发的时候很冷，到达教堂时就更冷了。做早祷时我们几乎要冻僵了，那儿离学校太远，不能回去吃午饭，在两次祷告之间分给一份冷肉和面包，分量也跟平时的饭食一样，少得可怜。

下午的祷告结束以后，我们沿着一条毫无遮掩的山路返回学校。冬日刺骨的寒风，吹过大雪覆盖的山峰，向北边刮来，几乎把我们脸上的皮都刮掉了。

我至今仍然记得，坦普尔小姐脚步轻快地走在我们这个垂头丧气的队伍旁边，寒风吹得她的花呢斗篷紧贴在身上。她一面口头开导我们，一面以身作则，鼓励我们振作精神，像她所说的，“像坚强的战士”那样奋勇前进。可怜其他教师，自己也十分颓丧，更顾不上为别人鼓劲了。

回到学校以后，我们多么渴望熊熊炉火发出的光和热！可是至少小姑娘们是得不到的，教室里的每个壁炉立刻被两排大姑娘围住，小一点的孩子只好成群蹲在她们身后，用围裙裹着冻僵了的胳膊。

吃茶点时，我们才得到些许安慰，发给了双份面包——一整片而不是半片——上面还涂了薄薄一层可口的黄油；这是我们从一个星期日盼望到另一个星期日每周一次的享受。通常我都设法能把这美餐的一部分留给自己，其余的总是不得不分给别人。

星期天晚上我们要背诵教堂的教义问答和《马太福音》的第五、六、七章，还要听米勒小姐冗长的讲道，她忍不住一再打哈欠，说明她也疲倦了。在这些节目中经常出现的一个插曲是，总有六七个小姑娘要扮演犹推古[1]的角色，她们因为困倦不堪，虽然不是从三楼上而是从第四排长凳上摔下来，扶起来时也已经半死了。挽救的办法是把她们推到教室的中间，迫使她们一直站着，直至讲道结束。有时她们的双脚不听使唤，瘫下来缩作一团，那就不得不用班长的高凳把她们支撑起来。

我还没有提到布罗克赫斯特先生的造访，其实这位先生在我到学校后第一个月的大部分日子里，都不在家；也许是在他的朋友副主教那里多逗留了些时间。他不在倒使我松了口气，不用说，我自有害怕他来的理由，可是他终于还是来了。

一天下午（当时我已经到洛伍德三个星期了），我手里拿了块写字板坐着，苦苦思索着一道乘除法，偶然心不在焉地向窗外一望，看到有一个人影闪过。我几乎本能地认出了那瘦削的轮廓。两分钟后，全校上下，整个学校的人，包括教师在内，都全体[2]起立时，我没有必要抬起头来看他们在迎接谁了。有人大步走过教室，不一会儿，曾经在盖茨黑德的壁炉地毯上狠狠地对我皱过眉的那根黑铁柱子，就已经矗立在了同样站起身来的坦普尔小姐身边。我侧目偷看了一眼这个建筑物，对，我没有看错，就是布罗克赫斯特先生，穿着紧身长外衣，扣紧纽扣，看上去越发瘦长刻板了。

我有理由为他的出现感到丧气。里德太太关于我的性情等等的恶意的暗示，布罗克赫斯特先生说过要把我的恶劣本性告诉坦普尔小姐和教师们的话，我都记得清清楚楚。我一直害怕他的这一诺言会得到兑现——每天都提防着这个“将要到来的人”。他关于我以往生活和言谈的介绍，会让我永远背上坏孩子的恶名，现在他终于来了。他站在坦普尔小姐身旁，跟她在小声耳语，毫无疑问他是在揭露我的恶劣行径。我急切而痛苦地望着坦普尔小姐的眼睛，随时准备着她乌黑的眸子转向我，投来厌恶与蔑视的一瞥。我也细听着，因为我正好坐在靠近屋子上手的地方，他说的话，一大半都能听得见。谈话的内容消除了我眼前的忧虑。

“坦普尔小姐，我想在洛顿买的线可以用吧，这种线缝衬衣正合适，我还挑了一些和它相配的针。请你告诉史密斯小姐，我忘了开一张买织补针的条子，不过下星期可以送给她；叫她无论如何每次最多只能给每个学生发一根针，给多了，她们往往不当回事，把它们弄丢了。噢，还有，小姐！但愿你们的羊毛袜子能照看得好些！上次我来这里的时候到菜园子里转了一下，仔细瞧了瞧晾在绳子上的衣服，看见不少黑色长袜都该补了，从破洞的大小来看，我肯定袜子经常没有好好地补。”

他停了一下。

“你的指示一定照办，先生。”坦普尔小姐说。

“还有，小姐，”他继续说下去，“洗衣女工告诉我，有些姑娘一周换了两次干净领饰；这太多了，按规定只能换一次。”

“我想这件事我可以解释一下，先生。上星期四，艾格妮丝和凯瑟琳·约翰斯通有朋友邀请她们去洛顿喝茶，我允许她们在这种场合换上干净的领饰。”

布罗克赫斯特先生点了点头。

“好吧，偶尔一次还行，但是，请不要让这种事经常发生。还有另一件事也叫我吃惊，我跟总管结账时，发现上两个星期，给姑娘们供应了两次点心，发了面包和奶酪，这是怎么回事？我查了一下规章，发现里面没有提到供应点心。是谁定的新制度？又得到了谁的批准？”

“这事由我负责，先生，”坦普尔小姐回答说，“早饭做得太糟，学生们都咽不下去。我不敢让她们一直饿到中午。”

“小姐，请允许我说几句——你应该清楚我培养这些姑娘，不是打算让她们养成骄奢放纵的习惯，而是让她们吃苦耐劳、善于忍耐、严于克己。如果偶尔有不合口味的小事发生，譬如一顿饭烧坏了，一个菜佐料加少了或者加多了，就代之以更可口的食物来弥补失去的享受，那样只会娇纵肉体，偏离这所学校的办学目的。应该利用这种事情给学生精神上的熏陶，鼓励她们在暂时艰苦的情况下，表现出坚韧不拔的精神。在这种场合，应该不失时宜地发表一个简短的讲话。一位贤明的导师会抓住机会，提一下早期基督徒所受的苦难；殉道者遭受的酷刑；我们神圣的主的亲口训诫，召唤使徒们背起十字架跟他走；提一下他给予的警告：人活着不是单靠面包，还得依靠上帝口中说出的每一句话；提一下他神圣的抚慰‘你们若为我忍饥受渴，便为有福’。噢，小姐，当你不是把烧焦的粥，而是把面包和奶酪放进孩子们嘴里的时候，你也许是在喂她们邪恶的肉体，而你却没有想到，你在使她们不朽的灵魂挨饿！”

布罗克赫斯特先生又停了一下，也许是感情太冲动的缘故。他开始讲话时，坦普尔小姐一直低着头，但现在眼睛却直视前方。她的脸本来就像大理石那样白，现在似乎更透出了大理石所特有的冷漠与坚定。尤其是她的嘴紧闭着，仿佛只有用雕刻家的凿子才能凿开似的，眉宇间也渐渐地呈现出一种凝固似的严峻神色。

这时候，布罗克赫斯特先生倒背着双手站在壁炉前，威风凛凛地检阅着全校。突然他的眼睛眨了一下，好像碰上了什么耀眼或者刺目的东西。他转过身来，用比刚才更急促的语调说：

“坦普尔小姐，坦普尔小姐，那个，那个鬈发姑娘是怎么回事？红头发，小姐，鬈发，满头都是鬈发？”他用鞭子指着那可怕的东西，手都有点儿发抖。

“那是朱莉娅·塞汶。”坦普尔小姐语调平静地回答。

“朱莉娅·塞汶，小姐！为什么她，或者是不管什么人，烫起鬈发来了？她竟然在我们这个福音派慈善机构里，无视学校的戒律和原则，这么肆无忌惮地迎合流俗，烫了一头鬈发？”

“朱莉娅是天生的鬈发。”坦普尔小姐的语调更加平静。

“天生的！不错，但我们不能顺从天性。我希望这些姑娘是受上帝恩惠的孩子，再说何必要留那么多头发？我一再表示我希望头发要剪短，要朴实，要简单。坦普尔小姐，那个姑娘的头发必须统统剪掉，明天我会派个理发匠来。我看其他人头上的那个累赘物也太多了——那个高个子姑娘，叫她转过身来。叫第一班全体起立，转过脸去，朝墙站着。”

坦普尔小姐用手帕轻轻地拭了一下嘴唇，仿佛要抹去嘴角上情不自禁的笑容，不过她还是下了命令。第一班学生弄明白对她们的要求之后，也都服从了。我坐在长凳上，身子微微后仰，可以看得见大家挤眉弄眼，做出各种表情，表示对这个命令不满。可惜布罗克赫斯特先生没能看到，否则他也许会感受到，他纵然可以摆布杯盘的外表，但其内部，却远非他所想的那样可以随意干涉了。

他把这些“活奖章”的背面细细打量了五分钟，然后宣布了判决，他的话一出口就像敲响了丧钟：

“头上的那些顶髻统统都要剪掉。”

坦普尔小姐似乎要抗议。

“小姐，”他接着说，“我为主效劳，他的王国并不属于这个世界。我的职责是压制这些姑娘肉体上的欲望，教导她们衣着朴素，不扎辫子，不穿华丽衣服。而我们面前的每个年轻人，出于虚荣都把一束头发编成辫子。我再说一遍，这些头发必须剪掉，想一想为此而浪费的时间，想想……”

说到这儿，布罗克赫斯特先生被打断了。另外三位来访者走进教室，都是女客。她们早来一点就好了，那就可以听听他刚才关于服饰的高论。她们穿着华丽，一身丝绒、绸缎和皮毛。三位中两位年轻的（十六七岁的漂亮姑娘）戴着当时十分时髦的灰色水獭皮帽，上面插着鸵鸟毛，在雅致的头饰边沿下，是一团浓密的鬈发，烫得十分精致。上年纪的那位太太裹着一条贵重的貂皮边丝绒披巾，额前还戴着法国式的假鬈发。

这几位太太小姐，一位是布罗克赫斯特太太，还有两位是布罗克赫斯特小姐。她们受到了坦普尔小姐恭敬的接待，被领到了教室一头的上座。看来她们是和担任圣职的家属乘一辆马车来的，在他和总管办理公务、查问洗衣妇、教训监督时，她们仔细地查看了楼上的房间。现在，她们对负责照管衣被、检查寝室的史密斯小姐提出了种种看法和责难。可是我现在没有时间听她们的话，另外的事情吸引了我的注意力。

在这以前，我一边留心听布罗克赫斯特先生和坦普尔小姐的谈话，一边始终没忘了注意保证自己的安全。我想只要我不让他看到，我就是安全的。为了达到这个目的，我坐在长凳上身体尽量往后靠，看上去像是在忙于做算术，把石板举得高高的，遮住我的脸。我本可以逃避别人的注意，却不料我那块捣乱的石板，不知怎么忽然从我手里滑了下去，砰的一声落在地上。顷刻之间人人都朝我看了过来。我知道这下全完了，我弯下腰捡起了碎为两半的石板，鼓足勇气准备面对最坏的结果。它终于来了。

“粗心的姑娘！”布罗克赫斯特先生说。接着又立刻说：“是个新来的学生，我看出来了。”我还没喘过气来，他又说：“我不能忘了，关于她我还有话要说。”然后他大声喊，在我听来那声音有多大啊！“叫打破石板的那个孩子到前面来！”

我自己已经动不了了，我瘫了下来。可是坐在我两边的两个大姑娘扶我站起来，推我朝那个可怕的法官走去。接着，坦普尔小姐轻轻地扶我到他的脚跟前，我听见她小声地安慰我：

“别怕，简，我知道你不是故意的，你不会受罚的。”

这善意的耳语像匕首一样直刺到我的心里。

“再过一分钟，她就会把我当做伪君子，瞧不起我了。”我想。一想到这点，心中便激起了一股对里德太太和布罗克赫斯特一伙的怒火，我可不是海伦·彭斯。

“把那张凳子拿来。”布罗克赫斯特先生指着一个很高的凳子说，一位班长刚从那儿站起来，凳子拿了过来。

“把这个孩子放上去。”

我被抱到了凳子上，是谁抱的，我并不知道，我已经不可能去注意这些小事了。我只知道他们把我抱到了和布罗克赫斯特先生的鼻子一样高的地方，他离我只有一码远；在我的下方，一片橘黄色和紫红色的闪缎饰皮外衣和浓雾般银色的羽毛在舒展，在飘动。

布罗克赫斯特先生清了清嗓子。

“女士们，”他转向他的家人，“坦普尔小姐，教师们和孩子们，你们都看到这个女孩了吧？”

她们当然都看到了，我觉得她们的眼睛像凸透镜似的对准了我烧痛的皮肤。

“你们瞧，她年纪还很小。你们看到了，她的外貌与别的孩子没有什么不同，上帝仁慈地赐予她和我们一样的外形，没有哪一点残缺的地方表明她是个特殊的人。谁能想到，魔鬼已经在她身上找到了一个奴仆和代理人？然而，我痛心地说，这的确是事实。”

他又停顿了一下。在这中间，我开始让自己紧张的神经稳定下来，觉得卢比孔河[3]已经渡过，既然审判已无法回避，只有坚强地去忍受了。

“我亲爱的孩子们，”这位黑大理石般的教士悲痛地继续说下去，“这是一个悲哀而令人忧伤的时刻，因为我有责任告诫大家，这个小姑娘原本可以成为上帝的羔羊，但是她却是一个遭到上帝摒弃的孩子，不是真正羔羊中的一个，而显然是一个闯入者，是一个异己。你们必须小心提防着她，避免学她的样子；必要的话，避免和她在一起，不许她加入你们的游戏，和你们交谈。教师们，你们必须看牢她：注意她的行踪，掂量她的话语，监视她的行动，惩罚她的肉体，以拯救她的灵魂，如果她的灵魂还可以拯救的话，因为（这话我都觉得有点难以说出口），这个姑娘，这个孩子，出生于一个基督徒的国度里，却比许多向梵天祈祷[4]、膜拜讫里什那神像[5]的小异教徒还坏，这个女孩是一个——说谎者！”

这次停顿了十分钟。这时我已经完全清醒了，只见布罗克赫斯特家的三个女人都拿出了手帕擦擦眼睛，上了年纪的那个摇晃着身子，年轻的两位低声说着：“多可怕啊！”

布罗克赫斯特先生继续说下去。

“我是从她的恩人那儿，一位虔诚慈善的太太那儿知道的。这位太太在她父母双亡的时候收养了她，把她当做自己的女儿来抚养，而这个姑娘竟以忘恩负义来报答她的善良和慷慨。这种行为多么恶劣，多么可怕。那位善良的女恩人终于不得不把她和自己的孩子隔开，以免她的行为玷污了他们的纯洁。她被送到这里来治疗，就像古时的犹太人把病人送往毕士大[6]搅动着的池水中一样。所有教师和学监，我请求你们不要让她周围的水停滞不动。”

说了这样精彩的结束语以后，布罗克赫斯特先生整了一下长大衣最上头的一个纽扣，与他的家属低声说了些什么，她们站起身来，向坦普尔小姐鞠了一躬。然后所有的大人物都威风凛凛地走出了房间。走到门口时，我的法官说：

“让她在那张凳子上再站半个小时，在今天剩下的时间里谁也不许和她讲话。”

于是我就在那儿高高地站着；我曾说过，我不能忍受站在教室中间的耻辱，但现在我却在众目睽睽之下站在耻辱台上。我的感受是无法用言语形容的。正当大家站起身来，我呼吸困难、喉咙紧缩的时候，一位姑娘走了过来，从我身边经过时，她抬起了眼睛。那双眼睛闪着多么奇怪的光芒啊！那道光芒使我产生了一种多么异乎寻常的感觉！这种新感觉又给予了我多大的支持！仿佛一位殉道者，一个英雄，走过一个奴隶或者牺牲者的身边，赋予了他力量。我控制住了正待发作的歇斯底里，抬起头来，坚定地站在凳子上。海伦·彭斯问了史密斯小姐某个关于她作业的小问题，因为问题太琐碎被申斥了一通。她回自己的位置时，再次经过我身边，朝我微笑了一下。这是怎样的微笑啊！我至今还记得，而且还明白这是睿智和真正勇气的流露，它像天使脸上的反光一样，照亮了她那富有特征的轮廓、瘦削的脸庞和深陷的灰色眼睛。而当时，海伦·彭斯的胳膊上还戴着“不整洁标记”；不到一小时之前我听见斯卡查德小姐罚她明天中饭只吃面包和喝清水，就因为她在抄写习题时弄脏了练习本。人的天性就是这样不完美！即使是最明亮的星球也会有黑斑，而斯卡查德小姐这样的眼睛只能看到细小的缺陷，却对星球的耀眼光芒视而不见。

第八章


半个小时不到，钟就敲响了五点。下课了，大家都进饭厅去吃茶点，我这才大着胆走下凳子。这时暮色正浓，我躲进一个角落，在地板上坐了下来。一直支撑着我的魔力消失了，反作用出现了。很快，压倒一切的悲伤攫住了我，我颓然扑倒在地上，号啕大哭起来。海伦·彭斯不在身边，我没有支撑。剩下我一个人，我难以自制，眼泪淌满了地板。我曾打算在洛伍德表现出色，做许多的好事，交一些朋友，赢得别人的尊敬，赢得大家的爱护，而且已经取得了明显的进步。就在那天早上，我在班上已经名列前茅，米勒小姐热情夸奖我，坦普尔小姐微笑着表示赞许，还答应教我绘画，让我学法文，只要我在两个月之内继续取得同样的进步。此外，我也深受同学们的欢迎，同我年龄相仿的人也对我平等相待，我已不再受人欺负。然而此刻，我又被打倒在地，遭人践踏。我还有再爬起来的一天吗？

“永远没有了。”我想，一心希望自己死掉算了。正当我泣不成声地诉说着这个心愿时，有人走近了我，我惊跳了起来。又是海伦·彭斯，她来到了离我不远处，渐暗的炉火恰好照亮她走过空空荡荡的长房间。她给我端来了咖啡和面包。

“来，吃点东西。”她说，可是我把咖啡和面包都从我面前推开了，只觉得仿佛咽一滴咖啡或一口面包就会把我噎住似的。海伦凝视着我，也许很惊奇，这时我虽已竭尽全力，却仍无法抑制内心的激动，继续大声哭着。她在我身旁的地上坐下，胳膊抱着双膝，把头靠在膝头上，她就那么像一个印度人似的坐着，一声不响。倒是我第一个开了口：

“海伦，你怎么会跟一个人人都相信是说谎者的人待在一起呢？”

“是人人吗，简？我只听见八十个人叫你撒谎者，而世界上有千千万万的人呢。”

“可是我跟那千千万万的人有什么关系呢？我认识的八十个人瞧不起我。”

“简，你错啦，也许学校里没有一个人会瞧不起你，或者讨厌你，我敢肯定，很多人都很同情你。”

“听了布罗克赫斯特先生的话以后，她们怎么可能同情我呢？”

“布罗克赫斯特先生不是神，也不是一个值得钦佩的伟人。这里的人不喜欢他，他也没干过什么让别人喜欢的事。如果他把你看成他的宠儿，你倒会在你的周围发现许多明里暗里的敌人。事实上，如果敢的话，大部分人都会同情你的。而且，只要你继续好好努力，用不了多久，这些感情正因为暂时的压抑，反而不久就会更加明显地表现出来。再说，简……”她停住了。

“怎么，海伦？”我说着把自己的手塞到了她手里，她轻轻地揉着我的手指，让它们暖和过来，又接着说下去：

“即使整个世界恨你，相信你很坏，只要你自己问心无愧，知道你是清白的，你就不会没有朋友。”

“不，我知道应该看重自己，但这还不够，如果别人不爱我，那么与其活着还不如死去——我受不了孤独和别人的厌恶，海伦。瞧，为了从你那儿，或者坦普尔小姐，或是任何一个我确实所爱的人那儿，得到真正的爱，我会心甘情愿忍受手臂骨被折断，或者愿让牛角把我挑起来，或者站在一匹马后面，任马蹄踢向我的胸膛——”

“嘘，简！你太看重人的爱了，你太冲动，太感情用事了。一只至高无上的手创造了你的躯体，又赋予了它生命，这只手除了造就了你脆弱的自身，或者与你一样脆弱的创造物之外，还给你提供了别的财富。在地球和人类之外，还有一个看不见的世界，一个神灵的王国。这个世界就在我们周围，因为它是无所不在的。那些神灵们守护着我们，因为它们是奉命保护我们的，哪怕我们被痛苦和耻辱折磨死去，鄙视从四面八方刺伤我们，仇恨把我们压得粉碎，天使们会看到我们的苦难，会承认我们清白无辜——如果我们确实清白无辜，我知道布罗克赫斯特先生对你的指控不过是从里德太太那儿听来的，既苍白无力又夸大其词，因为我从你热情的双眼和明净的前额上，看到了诚实的天性——而上帝要我们等待灵魂和肉体的分离，才会赐予我们充分的报酬。当生命很快结束，死亡必定成为幸福与荣耀之门时，我们又何必一味沉溺于痛苦之中呢？”

我默默无言。海伦使我平静，但在她所传递的宁静中，混合着一种难以言传的悲哀。她说话时我感受到了这种悲哀，但又不知道它从何而来。话一讲完，她开始有点气喘，短短地咳了几声，我立刻忘掉了自己的苦恼，隐隐地为她担起心来。

我把头靠在海伦的肩上，双手抱住了她的腰，她把我拉近一些，两人默默地偎依着。我们这样没坐多久，又有一个人进来了。刚刚刮起的风吹散了满天乌云，露出一轮明月。月光从邻近的窗户泻进来，清晰地照亮了我们两个人和那个走近的身影，我们立刻认出来，那是坦普尔小姐。

“我是特地来找你的，简·爱。”她说，“要你到我房间里去，既然海伦·彭斯也在，那也一起来吧。”

我们去了，跟在这位校长身后，穿过了一条条复杂的过道，爬上通向她房间的楼梯，走到她住的房间。房间里炉火正旺，十分惬意。坦普尔小姐叫海伦·彭斯坐在火炉一边的扶手椅上，她自己坐在另一把上，把我叫到她身边。

“没事了吧？”她低头瞧着我的脸问，“把伤心都哭完了？”

“恐怕永远也哭不完。”

“为什么？”

“因为我被冤枉了，小姐您，还有所有其他人，都会认为我是个坏孩子。”

“孩子，我们会根据你的表现来看待你的。继续做个好姑娘，你会让我满意的。”

“我会吗，坦普尔小姐？”

“你会的。”她搂着我，“现在你告诉我，被布罗克赫斯特称为你的恩人的那位太太是谁？”

“里德太太，我舅舅的妻子。我舅舅去世了，他把我交给她照顾。”

“那么说，她抚养你不是自愿的？”

“不是，小姐。不得不抚养我她很不情愿。我常听仆人们说，舅舅临终前要她保证永远照顾我。”

“好吧，简，你知道，至少我要让你知道，罪犯在被起诉时总是允许为自己辩护。你被指责为说谎，那现在你尽力为自己辩护吧，凡是你记得的事实你都说出来，可别添油加醋，夸大其词。”

我暗下决心，一定尽量说得准确无误，恰如其分。我先思考了几分钟，把该说的话理出了个头绪，便一五一十地向她诉说了悲苦的童年。因为激动得筋疲力尽，我说得比我平时谈论这个伤心的话题时语气要温和得多。我还记住了海伦的告诫，不要过于憎恨，在叙述时掺杂的刻薄和怨恨也比平时要少得多。这样有所克制和不过分啰唆，使我更加可信。我在说着的时候就觉察到，坦普尔小姐完全相信我的话。

我在叙述自己的经历时，还提到了劳埃德先生，说他在我昏厥后来看过我。我永远忘不了可怕的红房子事件，在说到细节时，我的情绪肯定有些过于激动，因为当里德太太冷漠地拒绝我拼命的求饶、把我第二次关进那间闹鬼的黑屋子时，那种阵阵揪心的痛苦，在记忆中是什么都抚慰不了的。

我讲完了。坦普尔小姐默默地注视了我几分钟，然后说：

“劳埃德先生我有点认识，我会写信给他的。如果他的答复和你说的相符，一定会公开澄清对你的诋毁。对我来说，简，现在你已经是清白的了。”

她吻了吻我，仍旧让我待在她身边（我非常乐意站在那里，因为我端详着她的脸，她的服装，她的一两件饰品，她那白皙的额头，浓密光亮的鬈发和乌黑发亮的眼睛时，从这里我得到了一种幼稚的喜悦）。她开始与海伦·彭斯说话：

“今晚你感觉怎么样，海伦？今天咳得厉害吗？”

“我想不太厉害，小姐。”

“胸口的疼痛呢？”

“好一点了。”

坦普尔小姐站起来，拉起她的手，量了量她的脉搏，又回到自己的座位上。在她坐下时，我听她轻声叹了口气。她沉思了一会儿，然后振作起精神来，愉快地说：

“可是今天晚上你们俩是我的客人，我得把你们当做客人来对待。”她按了下铃。

“芭芭拉，”她对应召而来的女仆说，“我还没吃点心，你把盘子端来，给两位年轻的小姐也放上杯子。”

盘子很快就端来了，在我看来，这些放在火炉旁小圆桌上的瓷杯和亮晶晶的茶壶多么漂亮啊！茶的热气和烤面包的味道多香啊！但是使我失望的是（因为开始觉得饿了），我发现面包只有很小的一份，坦普尔小姐也注意到了：

“芭芭拉，”她说，“不能再拿点面包和黄油来吗？这不够三个人吃。”

芭芭拉走了出去，很快又回来了。

“小姐，哈顿太太说已经按平时的分量送来了。”

得说明一下，哈顿太太是个管家，她完全符合布罗克赫斯特先生的心意，他们两个人的心都是用鲸鱼骨和铁制成的。

“噢，好吧。”坦普尔小姐回答，“我看，我们只好将就一下了，芭芭拉。”这位姑娘出去后，她微笑着补充说：“幸亏我能弥补这次的不足。”

她请海伦和我到桌子前，在我俩面前各放了一杯茶和一小片可口却很薄的烤面包，她站起来，用钥匙打开抽屉，从里面取出一个纸包。我们眼前立刻出现了一个很大的香草子饼。

“我本来想让你们每人带一点儿回去，”她说，“可是烤面包这么少，只好现在吃掉了。”她慷慨地把饼切成了一块块的。

那天晚上，我们享受了珍馐美味；我们的女主人带着满意的微笑，看着我们吃着她提供的美食，笑容中流露出款待客人的莫大愉快。吃完茶点，盘子端走后，她又把我们叫到火炉边去。我们两个人分别坐在她的两旁。这时，她与海伦开始谈话，能有机会听到这样的谈话真是难得的幸运。

坦普尔小姐向来神情宁静，风度庄重，谈吐文雅得体，这些让她不至于陷入狂热、激动和浮躁，这也同样让注视她、倾听她的人，出于一种敬畏心情，不会露出过分的喜悦，这就是我此刻的感觉。但是海伦·彭斯的情况却让我十分吃惊。

令人振奋的一餐，明亮的炉火，自己喜爱的老师的亲切招待，也许比这些更为重要的是，她自己与众不同的头脑中的某些想法，激起了她内心的力量。这些力量醒过来了，燃烧着。首先，她的脸上闪耀着奕奕神采，而在这以前，我在她的脸上只能看到苍白、毫无血色。还有，这也显露在她水灵且炯炯有神的眼睛里，这双眼睛突然呈现出一种比坦普尔小姐的眼睛更为独特的美，它没有好看的色彩，没有长长的睫毛，没有用眉笔描过的眉毛，却有一种内在的美，流动的美，光辉的美。随后她似乎心口交融，话语流畅。这些话从什么源头流出来，我无从判断。一个十四岁的女孩会有这样宽广、这样生气勃勃的胸怀，装得下这纯洁、充盈、热情洋溢的雄辩之泉？在这个我难以忘怀的晚上，海伦说起话来就是这样的特色；她的心灵似乎要急于在短暂的片刻中，充实度过别人在漫长的一生中度过的生活。

她们谈论着我从未听说过的事情，谈到古老的民族和时代、遥远的国度、已发现或还在猜测中的奥秘，还谈到了各种书籍。她们读过的书真多啊！她们的知识真渊博啊！她们似乎对法国人的名字和法国作者了如指掌。但最使我惊讶的是，这时坦普尔小姐问海伦是不是抽空在复习她爸爸教她的拉丁文，还从书架上取了一本书，让她朗读维吉尔[1]的一页著作并且逐字翻译；我的惊讶真是到了极点，海伦照着做了。听着她逐行朗读诗句，我心中对她愈加敬重。她还没有读完，寝铃就响了，不允许拖延。坦普尔小姐拥抱了我们两个，把我们搂到怀里时说：

“上帝保佑你们，我的孩子们！”

她拥抱海伦的时间比我要长，更不愿放她走。她一直目送海伦到门口，为了海伦，她再次伤心地叹了口气，为了海伦，她从脸上抹去了一滴眼泪。

到了寝室，我们听见了斯卡查德小姐的声音，她正在检查抽屉，而且刚好拉出海伦·彭斯的。我们一走进房间，海伦就被劈头盖脸地骂了一顿，还说要她明天把五六件叠得乱七八糟的东西别在肩上。

“我的东西的确乱得丢脸，”海伦喃喃地对我说，“我是想把它们放整齐的，可总是忘。”

第二天早上，斯卡查德小姐在一块纸牌上写下了十分醒目的一个词“邋遢”，像经匣[2]似的，把它系在海伦那宽阔温顺、聪颖厚道的额头上。她耐心而毫无怨言地戴着它，视之为应得的惩罚，一直戴到晚上。下午放学以后，斯卡查德小姐一走，我便跑到海伦那儿，一把撕下那块牌子，把它扔进火里。她所不会有的怒火整天在我心中燃烧着，大滴大滴的热泪，不断刺痛着我的脸颊，看着她那悲哀的、逆来顺受的样子，我的心里痛苦得难以忍受。

上述事件后大约一周，坦普尔小姐写给劳埃德先生的信有了回音，看来他在信中所说的，进一步证实了我的自述。坦普尔小姐把全校师生召集起来，当众宣布，对简·爱所受的指责已经做了调查，而且她很高兴能声明对简·爱的诋毁已彻底澄清。于是老师们过来和我握手，吻我，我的同学们的行列中也到处传来了高兴的低声议论。

这样我便卸下了一个沉重的包袱。我决心从头起步，决心排除万难自己闯出一条路来。我辛勤苦干，有几分耕耘，便有几分收获。我的记忆力虽然不是生来很强，但经过锻炼，已经有了改进，反复的练习使我的头脑更为机敏。几周之后，我升到了高班，不到两个月就获准学习法文和绘画。我学了动词être[3]最基本的两个时态；同一天我还作了自己的第一幅茅屋素描（顺便说一句，屋子墙壁的倾斜度可与比萨斜塔媲美）。那天夜里上床时，我忘了在想象中准备热的烤土豆、白面包和新鲜牛奶的巴米赛德[4]式晚餐了，往常我是以此来解馋的。而现在，我在黑暗中所见到的理想画面成了我的盛宴。所有的画作都出自我的手笔，熟练地勾画出树木房屋、别致的岩石和废墟、魁普[5]式的牛群，有蝴蝶在含苞欲放的玫瑰花上翩翩起舞，有鸟儿啄着成熟的樱桃；有藏着珍珠般鸟蛋的鹪鹩巢穴，四周环绕着一圈嫩绿的常春藤。我还在脑子里思量着是不是有可能把那天皮埃罗太太给我看的薄薄的法文故事书流利地翻译出来。这个问题还没有得到满意的解决，我就甜甜地睡着了。

所罗门说得好：“吃素菜，彼此相爱；强如吃肥牛，彼此憎恨。”[6]

现在，我绝不愿意用贫困的洛伍德去换取终日奢华的盖茨黑德。

第九章


然而，洛伍德的贫困，或者不如说是艰辛，有所减轻。春天渐近，实际上已经来临，冬季的严寒过去了。积雪已融化，刺骨的寒风有所缓和了。我可怜的双脚，原先被一月的寒气冻掉了一层皮，肿了起来，连走路都一瘸一拐的，如今在四月的和风下开始消肿和痊愈。夜晚和清晨不再出现加拿大式的低气温，险些把我们血管里的血冻住。现在我们也可以忍受花园中的游戏时刻了。有时碰到阳光灿烂的日子，甚至让人觉得愉快而舒适。枯黄的花坛里长出了一片新绿，一天比一天鲜嫩，仿佛使人觉得希望之神曾在夜间走过，每天清晨留下她愈来愈明亮的足迹。花朵从树叶丛中探出头来，有雪花莲、藏红花、紫色的报春花和金眼三色堇。每逢星期四下午（半假日），我们都出去散步，在路边的篱笆下还会看到一些更加可爱的花。

我还发现，在我们花园周围插满铁钉的高墙之外，有一种莫大的乐趣和享受，它广阔无垠，直达天际。这种愉快，包括可以看到崇山峻岭环抱着的一个树木葱茏绿荫盖地的大山谷；还包括一条清澈的山溪，里面布满了暗色的石块和闪亮的涡流。这种景色与我在冬日铁灰色的苍穹下，冰霜封冻、积雪覆盖时看到的情景多么不同呀！那时候，死一般冷的雾气在东风的驱赶下飘过紫色的山峰，滚下草地与河滩，直到和山溪上冰冻的雾气混合在一起。那时，这条小溪是一股混浊不堪、势不可当的急流，它冲决了树林，在空中咆哮，那声音往往夹杂着暴雨和旋转的冻雨，听起来更加沉闷。至于两岸的树木，看上去像是一排排骷髅。

时间由四月走向五月，这是一个明媚宁静的五月，整整一个月都是蔚蓝的天空、和煦的阳光、轻柔的西风或南风。现在，草木茁壮成长起来。洛伍德抖开了它的秀发，变成了一片绿色，到处都是鲜花。榆树、岑树和橡树光秃秃的高大树干恢复了勃勃的生机，林间植物在幽深处茂密生长，洼地里覆满了青苔。数不清的野樱草花，就像是奇妙的从地上长出来的阳光。我在林荫深处曾见过它们淡淡的金色光芒，犹如点点散开的可爱光斑。所有这一切我都尽情享受着，自由自在，无人看管，而且几乎总是独自一人。这种自由与乐趣所以这么不同寻常，是有其原因的，现在我的任务就是讲清楚这个原因。

我刚才说这儿依偎在树林和山冈之间，坐落于溪流之畔时，不是把它描绘成一个舒适的住处吗？的确，舒适倒是够舒适的，是否有益于健康，却是另一回事了。

洛伍德所在的林间山谷，是大雾和瘴疠的发源地；瘟疫随着春天急速的步伐，加速潜入了孤儿院，把斑疹伤寒带进了拥挤的教室和寝室，还没到五月，就已经把整所学校变成了医院。

学生们素来半饥半饱，得了感冒也无人过问，所以大多容易受到感染。八十个姑娘中病倒了四十五个。班级停课，纪律也松懈了。对于少数没有得病的，几乎完全放任自流，因为医护人员认为她们必须经常参加活动以保持身体健康。即使不是这样，也没有人顾得上看管她们了。坦普尔小姐的全部注意力都放在了病人身上，她整天待在病房里，除了夜间抽空休息几小时外，几乎寸步不离。别的教师们则完全忙于打点行李或做其他准备，送走那些有亲戚朋友能够而且愿意接她们离开的幸运姑娘们。很多已经染病的回家去等死；有些人则死在了学校里，马上悄悄地草草埋掉，疾病的性质容不得半点拖延。

就这样，疾病在洛伍德安了家，死亡成了这里的常客；校园内笼罩着阴郁和恐怖；房间里和走廊里散发着医院的气味，药物和香锭徒劳地挣扎着要盖住死亡的恶臭。而在户外，五月的明媚阳光从万里无云的天空，洒向陡峭的山冈和美丽的林地。洛伍德的花园也繁花似锦。蜀葵长得和树一样高，百合花已经开了，郁金香和玫瑰争妍斗艳，粉红色的海石竹和深红的双瓣雏菊，把小花坛的边缘装扮得十分鲜艳。多花蔷薇在清晨和夜间都散发着香料和苹果的香味。而这些芬芳的珍宝，除了能时时提供一束香草和鲜花放在棺材里，对洛伍德的人来说已毫无用处。

不过我和其余还没有病倒的人，可以充分享受着这景色和季节的美。它们让我们像吉卜赛人一样，从早到晚在林中游荡，爱干什么就干什么，爱上哪里就上哪里。我们的生活也有所改善。布罗克赫斯特先生和他的家人现在已不再靠近洛伍德，日常事务也无人来查问，坏脾气的管家也逃之夭夭了，生怕受到传染。接替她的人原来是洛顿诊所的护士长，对于新地方的规矩还没有习惯，因此伙食的供应比较自由一些。而且，吃饭的人少了，病人又吃得很少，于是我们早餐盘里的东西也就多了一些。常常没有时间准备正餐，干脆就给我们一大块冷饼，或者厚厚的一片面包和乳酪，我们把这些东西带到树林里，找个自己喜欢的地方，大吃一顿。

我最喜欢坐在一块光滑的大石头上。它在小溪正中，又白又干燥，只有涉水才能过去，我每次都是赤脚来完成这一壮举的。这块石头正好够舒舒服服地坐上两个人，我和另一位姑娘。她是我当时最要好的伙伴，叫玛丽·安·威尔逊，她聪明伶俐，目光敏锐。我喜欢和她做伴，一半是因为她头脑机灵，一半是因为她的举止不会让我感到拘束。她比我大几岁，经历的事情比我多一些，能告诉我很多我爱听的事情，满足我的好奇心。对于我的缺点她也能大方得不去计较，不管我说什么，她从不硬加管教和阻止。她善于叙述，我善于分析；她喜欢讲，我喜欢问；我们两个处得很融洽，从彼此的交往中即使得不到进步，也得到了不少乐趣。

这时候，海伦·彭斯到哪儿去了呢？为什么我没有和她一起度过这些自由自在的快乐日子呢？我把她忘了，还是我如此可鄙厌倦了她纯洁的友谊？玛丽·安·威尔逊当然比不上我的第一位相识，她只能给我讲些有趣的故事，或是和我一起沉迷于活泼尖刻的闲聊。而海伦呢，如果我没有说错的话，她可以让有幸听她谈话的人品味到趣味高级得多的东西。

的确如此，读者，我明白，并感觉到了这一点。虽然我是一个有缺点的人，毛病多优点少，但我决不会嫌弃海伦，对她的眷恋之情也从来没有停止过。这种感情和曾经激励过我心灵的任何一种感情一样强烈，一样温柔，一样令人珍重。不论何时何地，海伦都给了我默默而忠实的友谊。闹别扭或者发脾气都不会带来丝毫损害。可是现在海伦病倒了，好几个星期没有见到她了，她被搬到楼上的某个房间去了。听说她不在安置伤寒病人的房间里，因为她得的是肺病，不是斑疹伤寒。在我幼稚的心灵中，认为肺病比较轻，只要好好护理，过一段时间肯定会好的。

我的想法得到了证实，在暖和晴朗的下午，她偶尔被坦普尔小姐带到花园。但在这种场合，却不允许我过去和她说话。我只能从教室的窗户中看她，而且还看不清楚，因为她裹得严严实实，远远地坐在走廊上。

六月初的一个傍晚，我和玛丽·安在林子里待到很晚。和平时一样，我们又离开别人，到了很远的地方，我们迷路了，不得不去一间孤零零的茅舍问路。那里住着一户人家——丈夫和妻子，养了一群以林间山毛榉为食的半野的猪。我们回校时，月亮已经升起来了。在花园门口看到一匹矮马，我们认得这是医生的马。玛丽·安说，她想一定是有人病得很重，这么晚了还派人请贝茨先生来。她先进屋，我在外面待了几分钟，把我刚从森林里挖来的花根栽在花园里，怕留到第二天早晨会枯死。栽好以后，我又多耽搁了一会儿。降露水的时候，花是那么香甜；这是一个如此可爱的夜晚，那么宁静，又那么温暖。西边天际仍亮着一片霞光，预示着明天又是好天气。月亮从黯淡的东方庄严升起。我注意着这一切，尽一个孩子所能欣赏的程度欣赏着。这时我脑海里出现了一个从未有过的想法：

“现在躺在病床上，随时面临着死亡的威胁是多么悲哀呀！这个世界如此美好，被迫离开这儿，到一个谁都不知道的地方去，是多么悲惨呀。”

这时我第一次潜下心来理解以前灌输进去的天堂和地狱的事：它第一次畏缩起来，不知所措了。它第一次瞻前顾后，却只见周围一片无底深渊。它感到除了现在这一立足点之外，其余一切都是无形的浮云和空虚的深渊。想到自己摇摇晃晃要落入一片混乱之中，就不寒而栗。我正细细咀嚼着这个新想法，听见前门开了，贝茨先生走了出来，后面还有一个护士。她目送贝茨先生上马离去后，正要关门，我跑到她面前。

“海伦·彭斯怎么样了？”

“很糟糕。”她回答说。

“贝茨先生是来看她的吗？”

“是的。”

“他说她的病怎么样了？”

“他说她不会在这儿待多长时间了。”

如果我是昨天听到这句话，它所表达的含意只能是，她将要搬到诺森伯兰郡自己家去了，我不会去怀疑它包含着“她要死了”的意思。但现在我立刻明白了。我清清楚楚地感觉到，海伦在世的日子已经屈指可数了，她将被带往精灵的地域，如果这样的地域确实存在的话。我感到一阵恐怖，接着是一阵钻心的悲伤，随后是一种愿望——一种想要见到她的愿望，我问她在哪一个房间。

“她在坦普尔小姐的房间。”护士说。

“我可以上去和她说话吗？”

“啊，不行，孩子！这不可能。现在你该进来了，如果降了露水还待在外面，你也会发烧的。”

护士关了前门，我从通往教室的边门进去。我正好准时，九点钟整，米勒小姐正吩咐学生上床。

也许过了两小时，可能是将近十一点了，我难以入睡，而且从宿舍里的一片沉寂推断，我的同伴们都已经睡熟。于是我轻手轻脚地爬起来，在睡衣外面穿了件外衣，赤着脚从屋里溜了出来，去寻找坦普尔小姐的房间。它在房子的另外一头，不过我认得路。夏夜的皎洁月光，零散地洒进过道的窗户，使我毫不费力地找到了她的房间。一股樟脑味和烧焦的醋味，提醒我已走近了伤寒病房。我快步走过门前，生怕通宵值班的护士听到我的声音。我唯恐被人发现然后被赶回房去。我必须看到海伦——在她死之前我必须拥抱她一下——我必须最后吻她一下，说最后一句话。

我下了楼梯，穿过楼下的一段路，终于毫无声响地开关了两道门，到了另一排楼梯；我走上楼梯，对面就是坦普尔小姐的房间。一点微光从锁孔里和门底下透出来，四周一片寂静。我走近一看，发现门虚掩着，也许是为了让闷人的病室进去一点新鲜空气。我不喜欢犹豫，而且当时迫不及待——我全身心都因极度痛苦而颤抖——我推开门向里面看，寻找着海伦，生怕看到的是死亡。

紧挨着坦普尔小姐的床，有一张小床被白色的帷帐遮盖了一半。我看到了被子底下身体的轮廓，但脸被帷幔遮住了。那位在花园里和我讲过话的护士坐在一把安乐椅上睡着了。一支没有剪去灯芯的蜡烛在桌子上昏暗地燃着，没有看到坦普尔小姐。后来我才知道，她被叫到伤寒病室里一个昏迷不醒的病人那儿去了。我向前走去，在小床旁边停了下来。我的手伸向帷幔，但我宁愿在拉开之前先开口说句话，我畏缩了，唯恐看到的是一具尸体。

“海伦！”我轻声地唤她，“你醒着吗？”

她动了一下，拉开帷幔，我看到了她的脸，苍白、憔悴，却十分镇静，她看上去几乎没什么变化，我的恐惧立即消失了。

“怎么是你，简？”她以她独特的柔和声音问。

“啊！”我想，“她不会死，他们搞错了，如果她要死了，不可能说话和神情都这么镇定。”

我上了她的小床，吻了她一下。她的额头冰冷，两颊也冰冷，而且还很消瘦，她的手和手腕也是冰冷的，只有微笑还和原来一样。

“你怎么到这儿来了，简？已经过了十一点了，几分钟前我听见敲了钟。”

“我来看你，海伦。我听说你病得很重，不和你说句话我睡不着。”

“那你是来和我告别了，也许你来得正是时候。”

“你要去哪儿，海伦？你要回家吗？”

“是的，回我永久的——我最后的家。”

“不，不，海伦。”我停下了，伤心极了。我竭力咽下眼泪，这时海伦一阵咳嗽，不过没有吵醒护士。咳嗽过去以后，她筋疲力尽地躺了几分钟，然后轻声说：

“简，你还光着脚呢，躺下来吧，盖上我的被子。”

我照她的话做了。她用胳膊搂住我，我紧紧依偎着她，沉默了许久，她又接着低声说：

“我很高兴，简。当你听到我死了的时候，千万不要悲伤。没有什么可以悲伤的，总有一天我们大家都得死去。现在正夺去我生命的疾病并不痛苦。它比较温和，发展也慢，我的心灵已经得到安息，我没有什么牵挂。我只有一个父亲，他最近结了婚，也不会思念我了。我那么年轻就死去，反而能逃避许多严酷的磨难。我没有什么能在这个世界上做出丰功伟业的气质和才华，我肯定我会一直犯错误的。”

“可是你要去哪儿呀，海伦？你能看到吗？你知道吗？”

“我相信，我有信仰，我要去上帝那儿。”

“上帝在哪儿？上帝是什么？”

“我的创造者，也是你的创造者。他永远不会毁坏他所创造的东西。我毫无保留地依赖他的力量，完全相信他的仁慈，我计算着时间，直到那个重要时刻到来，那时我又被送还给他，他会再次显现在我面前。”

“海伦，那你肯定的确有天堂这个地方，而且我们死后灵魂都到那儿去吗？”

“我敢肯定有一个未来的国度，我相信上帝是仁慈的。我可以毫无畏惧地把我不朽的灵魂托付给他，上帝是我的父亲，是我的朋友。我爱他，我相信他也爱我。”

“海伦，我死以后，还能再见到你吗？”

“你会来到同一个幸福的地方，被同一个伟大的、万能的父亲所接纳，这毫无疑问，亲爱的简。”

我不禁又问，不过这次是在心里问。“这个地方在哪儿？它存在不存在？”我用胳膊把海伦搂得更紧了。她对我似乎比以往任何时候都宝贵，我仿佛觉得我不能让她走，我躺着把脸埋在她的脖子下面。她立刻用最甜蜜的声音说：

“我多么舒服啊！刚才那一阵咳嗽让我有点儿累了，我觉得好像要睡着了，不过别离开我，简，我喜欢你在我身边。”

“我会和你在一起，亲爱的海伦。谁也不能把我带走。”

“你暖和吗，亲爱的？”

“是的。”

“晚安，简。”

“晚安，海伦。”

她吻了我，我吻了她，我们两个很快就睡着了。

我醒来的时候天已经亮了，一阵异样的动作把我弄醒了。我抬起头来，发现自己躺在别人的怀里；那位护士抱着我，正穿过走廊把我送回寝室。我并没有因为离开自己的床位而受到责备，人们还要忙别的事儿，我提出的很多问题也没有得到回答。一两天后我知道，坦普尔小姐在黎明时分回到房间时，发现我躺在小床上，我的脸紧贴着海伦·彭斯的肩膀，胳膊搂着她的脖子，我睡着了，而海伦——死了。

她的坟墓在布罗克布里奇桥墓地，她去世后十五年中，墓上仅有一个杂草丛生的土墩，不过现在已经立了一块灰色的大理石墓碑标出了这个地方，上面刻着她的名字及“Resurgam[1]”这个词。

第十章


到目前为止，我已经详细记述了我微不足道的生活中的一些事情。我一生的最初十年，差不多花了十章来描写。但这不是一部正规的自传。我只是想重新回忆一些我认为可以使读者感兴趣的记忆而已。因此我现在要几乎只字不提跳过那以后八年的生活，只想简单交代几句以保持上下文的衔接。

斑疹伤寒在洛伍德完成了它的摧毁使命以后，便逐渐从那里销声匿迹了。不过，那是在它的危害以及受害者的人数引起了公众对学校的关注之后的事了。人们对这场灾祸的根源做了调查，而逐步披露的事实大大激怒了公众。学校所在的地点不利于健康，孩子们的食物的分量和质量，做饭用的带咸味的臭水，学生们的穿着和居住条件的恶劣，这一切都暴露无遗，其结果是布罗克赫斯特先生失脸面，学校则获益匪浅。

郡里一些富有的慈善家慷慨解囊，在一个更好的地点建造了一座更适用的大楼。重新制定了校规，伙食和衣着都有所改善。学校的经费委托给一个委员会管理。布罗克赫斯特先生凭着不能忽视的财富和家族关系，保留了司库一职。但在他行使职务时要由几位更为慷慨也更富有同情心的绅士协助。他作为督导的职能，也由他人一起来承担，他们知道该怎样把理智与严格、舒适与经济、怜悯与正直结合起来。学校因此大有改进，终于成了一个真正高尚而有用的机构。学校经过革新以后，我在校园里生活了八年，当了六年的学生，两年的教师。这两种身份都能使我成为这所学校的价值和重要性的见证。

在这八年中，我的生活一成不变，但不能说不愉快，因为它并非死气沉沉。我有了受到良好教育的机会，喜爱某些课程，一心想在各方面表现出色，再加上为自己能得到老师们，尤其是自己所喜欢的老师们的喜爱而感到的喜悦，这一切都激励我奋进。我充分利用提供的有利条件，终于一跃而成为班级的第一名，后来又被授予教师职务，满腔热情地干了两年，但两年之后我改变了主意。

坦普尔小姐历经种种变迁，一直担任着学校的校长，我所取得的绝大部分成绩归功于她的教导。和她的友谊和交往始终是我的一种安慰。她担当了我的母亲和家庭教师的角色，后来又成了我的同事。在这期间，她结了婚，随她的丈夫（一位牧师，一个出色的男人，与这样一位妻子很般配）迁往一个遥远的郡，因此我失去了她。

自从她离开的那天起，我就不再是原来的我了。那种安定的感觉，那些让我觉得洛伍德有几分像家的联想，都随着她的离开而消失了。我从她那儿吸收了某些个性和很多习惯——比较和谐的思想，比较有节制的感情，已经在我的头脑里扎了根。我忠于职守，遵守纪律。我行为平和，相信自己很满足。在别人的眼中，甚至在我自己看来，我似乎是一位循规蹈矩、安分守己的人。

但是命运借助于纳史密斯牧师把我和坦普尔小姐分开了。举行婚礼后不久，我就眼看着她身着旅行装跨进一辆驿站马车。我凝视着马车爬上小山，消失在山顶的那一边。然后我回到自己的房间，在孤寂中度过了为庆祝婚礼而放的半天假中的绝大部分时间。

大部分时候我在房间里踯躅。我本以为自己只会一味惋惜所受到的损失，考虑如何加以补救，但当我结束了思考，抬头一看，发觉下午已经过去。夜色正浓时，我突然有了新的发现。那就是在这段时间，我经历了一个转变，我已经抛弃了从坦普尔小姐那儿学来的东西，或者不如说她带走了我在她身边所感受到的宁静气息。现在我又恢复了自己的本性，感到原有的情绪开始萌动了。我并不是失去了支柱，而是失去了动机；并不是无力保持平静，而是需要保持平静的理由已不复存在。几年来，我的世界就在洛伍德，我的经历就是学校的规章制度，而现在我记起来了，真正的世界无限广阔，一个充满着希望与忧虑、刺激与兴奋的变化多端的天地等待着那些有胆识、敢于冒风险、追求人生真谛的人们。

我来到窗前，打开窗向外眺望。我看见了大楼的两翼，看见了花园，看见了洛伍德的边缘，看见了山峦起伏的地平线。我的目光越过这一切，停留在那些最遥远的蓝色山峰上；那正是我渴望去攀登的山峰，周围一片乱石和黄草地，似乎是囚禁和流放犯人的场所。一条白色的道路蜿蜒着绕过山脚，消失在两山之间的峡谷之中。我的目光顺着这条大路望去，我多么希望能看到更远的地方啊！我记起了我乘着马车沿着那条路走的日子，还有在黄昏时分从山上驶下。自从我被第一次带到洛伍德时起，仿佛一个世纪已经过去，而我从来没有离开过这里。假期都是在学校里度过的，里德太太从来没有把我接到盖茨黑德去过，不管是她本人，还是家里的其他人，从未来看过我。我与外部世界既没有书信往来，也不通任何信息。学校的规定、任务、习惯、观念、音容、语言、服饰、好恶，就是我所知道的生活内容。但现在我觉得这很不够。在短短的一个下午，我对八年的常规生活突然感到厌倦了。我憧憬着自由，迫切地向往着自由，我为获得自由作了一个祷告，但是这祈祷似乎被周围的微风所驱散。于是我不再奢求，设想了一个更低的目标，只要求变化和刺激。这种祈求似乎也被吹到了茫茫的太空中。“那么，”我近乎绝望地叫道，“至少赐给我一个新的工作吧！”

这时，晚饭铃响了，把我召唤到了楼下。

直到就寝时，我才有时间继续那被打断了的沉思。即便在那时，同房间的一位教师还絮絮叨叨闲聊了好久，使我没法回到我所渴望的问题上。我多么希望睡眠能让她安静下来！仿佛只要我重新思考伫立窗前时闪过脑际的念头，一个富于创造性的建议就会冒出来让我摆脱困境似的。

格丽丝小姐终于打鼾了。她是一位粗笨的威尔士女人，在此之前我对她惯常的鼻音曲除了觉得讨厌，没有别的看法。而今晚我满意地迎来了它最初的深沉曲调。我终于摆脱了干扰，心中那渐已模糊的想法又重新清晰起来。

“一种新的工作！这有点道理。”我自言自语（要知道，只是心里想想，没有说出口来），“我知道是有道理，因为它并不十分动听，不像自由、兴奋、享受这些词，它们的声音确实很悦耳，但却徒然浪费时间。但是工作却全然不同！它毕竟是实实在在的，任何人都可以工作。我在这儿已经待了八年，现在我所企求的不过是到别处工作。难道我连这点愿望也达不到？难道这事也不可行？对，对，要达到目的并不困难，只要我肯动脑筋，找到达到目的的方法。”

我从床上坐起来，以便开动脑筋。这是一个寒冷的夜晚，我在肩上围了块披巾，然后便全力以赴地进一步思考起来。

“我需要什么呢？在新的环境、新的面孔、新的房子中一个新的工作。我只要这个，因为好高骛远是徒劳无益的。人们怎样才能找到一个新工作呢？我猜想他们求助于朋友。但是我没有朋友。很多没有朋友的人只好自己动手去找工作，自己帮自己，他们采用什么办法呢？”

我说不上来，也找不到答案。然后我命令自己的脑子找到一个答案，而且要快。我动着脑筋，越转越快。我感到我的脑袋和太阳穴在搏动。但一个小时过去了，我的脑子乱七八糟，一切努力毫无结果。我因为徒劳无功而暴躁不安，便站起身来，在房间里转一转，拉开窗帘，望见一两颗星星，在寒夜中颤抖，我又重新爬到床上。

肯定是有一位善良的仙女，趁我不在床上时把我需要的答案放到了我的枕头上，因为我躺下时，这个答案便悄悄地自然而然地进入了我的脑海：“凡是求职的人总是登广告，你一定要到××郡的《先驱报》上去登个广告。”

“怎么登呢？我对广告一无所知。”

回答来得自然而又及时：

“你必须把广告和广告费放在一个信封里，寄给《先驱报》的编辑；一有机会你就把信封投到洛顿邮局，写明回信务必寄往那里邮局的J.E.[1]收。信寄出后大约一个星期，你可以去查询。如果有了回信，再看情况行事。”

这个计划我琢磨了两三次，直到它在我的脑子里成熟了，我设想得既清晰又具体，感到很满意，不久便酣然入梦了。

第二天一大早我就起来了，没等起床铃把全校吵醒就写好了广告词，封入信封，写上地址。信是这样写的：





现有一年轻女士，熟悉教学（我不是做了两年教师吗？），愿谋一家庭教师职位，教授十四岁以下儿童（我想自己才十八岁，去指导一个跟我年龄相仿的人是不行的）。该女士能胜任英国良好教育所含的常规课程，以及法语、绘画和音乐（读者，现在看来这些不算什么特长，在当年却已经很广博了）。回信请寄××郡，洛顿邮局，J.E.收。





这封信在我抽屉里锁了整整一天。直到下午用完茶点以后，我向新来的校长请假，说要去洛顿为自己和一两位共事的老师办些小事。得到她的许可后我便去了。到洛顿要步行两英里，傍晚还下着雨，好在白天还算长。我逛了一两家商店，把信送到邮局，冒着大雨回来，衣服都淋透了，但心里却很轻松。

接着的那个星期似乎很长，然而，像世上的所有事情一样，终于到了尽头。一个秋高气爽的傍晚，我再次踏上了去洛顿的路途。顺便说一下，小路上风景如画，沿着小溪蜿蜒着穿过一条景色诱人的山谷。不过那天我想得更多的不是草地和溪水的美丽，而是我要去的那个小镇上那封可能在（也可能不在）等着我的信。

这次我表面上的任务是去定做一双鞋。所以我先去办完了这件事。然后从鞋匠那儿出来，穿过清洁宁静的小街，来到邮局。管理员是位老妇人，鼻梁上架着角质眼镜，手上戴着黑色露指手套。

“有写给J.E.的信吗？”我问。

她从眼镜上方盯着我看了一会儿，然后打开一个抽屉，在里面放着的东西中间翻了好久。时间那么长，我都快不抱什么希望了。最后，她终于把一封信放到眼镜底下看了将近五分钟，才隔着柜台递给了我，同时还用探究和疑虑的目光瞥了我一眼——这封信是写给J.E.的。

“只有这么一封吗？”我问。

“没有了。”她说，我把信放进口袋，转过身来往回走。当时我不能拆开，按照规定我得八点前返回，而这时已经七点半了。

一到学校便有种种事情等着我。姑娘们自习时我得坐在那儿陪着她们，接着就轮到我来读祈祷文，看着她们上床。然后和其他教师一起吃了晚餐。即使到了最后夜间安寝时，还有那位始终避不开的格丽丝小姐与我做伴。烛台上只剩下一短截蜡烛了，我担心她会喋喋不休地讲到蜡烛燃完。幸好那一顿饭产生了催眠的作用，还没等我脱完衣服，她就已经鼾声大作了。蜡烛只剩下一英寸了，我取出信，信封上署着缩写F.，我打开信封，内容很简短：





如上周四在郡《先驱报》上登了广告的J.E.确实具备她所提及的修养，并能为自己的品格与能力提供满意的证明人，即可获得一份工作，仅需教一名学生，一个不满十岁的小女孩，年薪为三十英镑。务请将证明人及其姓名、地址和详情寄往下列姓名和地址：××郡，米尔科特附近，桑菲尔德，费尔法克斯太太收。





我把信件细看了很久。字体是老式的，笔迹不大稳，像是一位老年妇女写的。这一情况倒是让人满意的。我曾暗自担心，怕我这样自作主张，自行其是，会有陷入某种困境的危险。尤其重要的是，我希望自己努力得来的成果是体面的、正当的、规规矩矩的。我现在感到，现在的这件事里有一位上年纪的老太太倒是好事。费尔法克斯太太！我可以想象得出她身着黑色长袍，戴着寡妇帽，也许显得冷淡一些，但并不失礼，是一位典型的英国老派的体面人物。桑菲尔德！毫无疑问，那是她住宅的名称，肯定是个整洁而井井有条的地方，尽管我无力设想这幢房子的确切结构。××郡的米尔科特，我重温了记忆中的英国地图。不错，郡和镇都看到了。××郡比我现在居住的最偏远的郡离伦敦要近七十英里。这对我来说是十分可取的。我向往生活丰富活跃的地方。米尔科特是个大工业城市，坐落在埃×河岸上，无疑是一个相当繁华的地方。这样岂不更好，至少也是个彻底的改变。想象中那些高大的烟囱和团团烟雾对我自然不会有太大的吸引力——“不过，”我辩解着，“也许桑菲尔德离城很远呢。”

这时，残烛落入了烛台孔中，烛芯熄灭了。

第二天我得采取进一步的行动了，这个计划不能只藏在心里。为了获得成功，我必须说出来。下午娱乐活动的时间，我去拜见了校长，告诉她我有可能找到一个新的职位，薪金是我目前所得的两倍（在洛伍德我的年薪为十五英镑），请她替我把这事透露给布罗克赫斯特先生或委员会里的某些成员，并问问他们是否有人同意做我的证明人。她欣然同意做中间人促成此事。第二天，她向布罗克赫斯特先生提了这件事，而他说必须写信通知里德太太，因为她是我的当然监护人，结果便向那位太太发了封简函。她回信说“想做什么就做什么”，她很久以前就不再管我的事了。这封信函在委员会里传阅，并经过了在我看来长得令人厌烦的拖延后，我终于得到了正式许可，允许我在可能的情况下改善自己的境遇，还附加了一份保证。由于我在洛伍德学习和任教期间一向表现良好，将随即为我提供一份由学校督学签字的品格和能力证明书。

大约一周以后，我拿到了这份证明书，抄寄了一份给费尔法克斯太太，并得到了那位太太的回复，说是对我感到满意，并定于两周后去那位太太家就任家庭教师。

现在我忙于做准备。两周时间飞快地过去了。我没有太多的衣服，不过也够我穿的。所以完全来得及在最后一天整理箱子——还是八年前从盖茨黑德带来的那一只。

箱子用绳子捆好，贴上了标签。半小时之后有脚夫来把它取走，送往洛顿，我自己则要第二天一早赶到那里去搭公共马车。我把我那件黑呢旅行装刷干净，准备好帽子、手套和皮手筒；又把所有的抽屉翻了一遍，看看是否遗忘了什么。这以后，我就没有更多的事要做了，便想坐下来休息一下。但是我做不到，尽管我已奔忙了一整天，但是仍一点也无法休息。我太兴奋了，我生活的一个阶段今天晚上就要结束，明天将开始一个新的阶段。在这之间，我是不可能安心入睡的，我必须满腔热情地注视着这一变化的完成。

我像个不安的幽灵似的在门厅里游荡，这时，一个仆人进来对我说：“小姐，楼下有人要见你。”

“肯定是脚夫，”我想，没有细问就奔下楼去。我正经过半开着的后客厅——也就是教师休息室——向厨房走去，有人忽然从里面跑了出来。

“肯定是她！无论在哪儿我都能认出她来！”那人拦住我，一把抓住了我的手叫道。

我看了看，是一个少妇，像一个衣着讲究的仆人，看样子是已婚妇女，但年轻漂亮，黑头发黑眼睛，脸色红润。

“嗯，这是谁呢？”她的声音我还依稀记得。

“我想你没有把我完全忘记吧，简小姐？”

刹那间我就狂喜地抱住了她，吻起她来。“贝茜！贝茜！贝茜！”除了叫她的名字以外，我什么也说不出来了；她听了则是又哭又笑，我们两个进了客厅。壁炉旁边站着一个三岁左右的小家伙，身穿花格呢外衣和裤子。

“这是我的儿子。”贝茜立刻说。

“这么说，你结婚了，贝茜？”

“是，已经快五年了，嫁给了马车夫罗伯特·利文，除了站在这儿的鲍比，我还有一个小女孩，我把她的教名取做简。”

“你不住在盖茨黑德了？”

“我住在门房里，原来那个看门的走了。”

“噢，他们都过得怎么样？把他们的事情都告诉我，贝茜。不过先坐下来，还有鲍比，过来坐在我的膝上好吗？”但鲍比还是喜欢在妈妈身边。

“你长得不算太高，也不太壮，简小姐，”利文太太继续说，“我想学校里没有把你照顾太好吧，里德小姐要比你高出很多呢。而乔治亚娜小姐要比你胖一倍。”

“乔治亚娜肯定很漂亮吧，贝茜？”

“很漂亮。去年冬天她和妈妈去了伦敦，在那儿人人都夸她，一个年轻勋爵爱上了她，但勋爵的亲戚们反对这门亲事，后来——你猜怎么样——他决定和乔治亚娜小姐私奔，可是让人发现了，受到了阻止。发现他们的正是里德小姐，我想她是出于妒忌，现在她们姐妹俩在一起就像猫狗似的不相容，总是吵架。”

“那么，约翰·里德怎么样了？”

“噢，他可没有他妈妈希望的那样好。他去上了大学，但是考试不及格，给——‘刷’下来了，我想他们是这么说的。后来他的几个舅舅想让他将来当律师，学习法律，但他是个浪荡小伙子，我想他们永远没办法让他混出点名堂来。”

“他长得怎么样？”

“很高，有人说他是个帅气的小伙子，不过他的嘴唇很厚。”

“里德太太怎么样？”

“太太看上去有些发胖，外表看看还不错，不过我想她的心情可能不会太好。约翰先生的行为让她很不高兴——约翰先生花掉了很多钱。”

“是她让你到这里来的吗，贝茜？”

“说真的，不是。不过我早就想见你了。我听说你写了信来，说是要去另一个地方了，我想我还是在你走之前来看看你。”

“恐怕你对我失望了吧，贝茜。”说完我笑了起来。我发觉贝茜的目光虽然流露出关切，却丝毫没有赞赏之意。

“不，简小姐，不完全是这样。你很文雅，看上去像大家闺秀。这和我原来预料的一样，你还是孩子的时候就长得不漂亮。”

听了贝茜坦率的回答，我笑了。我想她说得很对，但我也承认，对她的话并非毫不在意。大多数人在十八岁时都希望自己能讨人喜欢；一旦意识到自己的外貌不大可能帮助自己实现这个愿望时，心里是绝不会高兴的。

“不过我想你很聪明，”贝茜继续说，以示安慰，“你会写什么呢？会弹钢琴吗？”

“会一点儿。”

房间里有一架钢琴，贝茜走过去把它打开，然后让我坐下来给她弹支曲子。我弹了一两首华尔兹，她听得着了迷。

“里德家的两位小姐弹不了这么好！”她欣喜地说，“我一直说你在学问上一定会超过她们的，你会画画吗？”

“壁炉架上的那幅画就是我画的。”那是一幅水彩风景画，我把它作为礼物送给了校长，以感谢她代表我在委员会中所作的善意周旋。她给这幅画加了框。

“嗯，好漂亮，简小姐！这和里德小姐的绘画老师画得一样好，更不用说年轻小姐们自己了。她们和你相比差远啦，你学法语了吗？”

“学了，贝茜，我能看也能说。”

“你会在细布和粗布上刺绣吗？”

“我会。”

“啊，你真是大家闺秀啦，简小姐！我早知道你会这样的。不管你的亲戚是否照应你，你都会有出息的。有件事儿我想问你，你父亲的亲属、爱家的人，有没有给你写过信？”

“从来没有。”

“啊，你知道太太总是说，他们又穷又让人瞧不起。他们可能是穷，但我相信他们和里德家的人一样都是上等人。大约七年前有一天，一位爱先生到盖茨黑德，想要见见你。太太说你在五十英里外的学校，他看上去很失望，因为没有时间耽搁。他要乘船到外国去，一两天后从伦敦起航。他看上去完全是位绅士，我想他是你父亲的兄弟。”

“他要去国外哪个国家，贝茜？”

“几千英里外的一个岛，那儿出产酒——管家告诉我的。”

“马德拉岛？”我提示她。

“对，就是这地方——就是这几个字。”

“那他走了？”

“是的，他在屋里没有待多长时间。太太对他很傲慢，后来她管他叫‘狡猾的生意人’，我家的罗伯特认为他是个酒商。”

“很可能，”我答道，“或者是酒商的职员或代理人。”

贝茜又和我谈了大约一个小时的往事，后来，她不得不告辞了。第二天在洛顿等车时又见到了她，我们在一起待了五分钟，最后在布罗克赫斯特纹章店的门口分了手，各奔东西了；她动身去洛伍德山搭车回盖茨黑德；而我登上车子，让它把我带往米尔科特那个陌生的郊区，从事新的工作，开始新的生活。

第十一章


小说中新的一章就像是戏剧中新的一场。这次当我把帷幕拉开的时候，读者，你一定想，你看到的是米尔科特乔治客栈里的一个房间。这里和其他客栈的陈设大致相同，一样的大图案墙纸，一样的地毯，一样的家具，一样的壁炉台上的饰品，一样的图画，其中一幅是乔治三世[1]的肖像，另一幅是威尔士亲王的肖像，还有一幅表现的是沃尔夫[2]之死。借着悬挂在天花板上的油灯和壁炉的熊熊火光，这一切你都可以看见。我把皮手筒和伞放在桌子上，披着斗篷戴着帽子坐在壁炉旁取暖。我凌晨四点从洛顿出发，到米尔科特镇时时钟正敲响八点。在十月阴冷的天气里奔波了十六个小时，身体都冻僵了。

读者，尽管看上去我住得舒舒服服的，但内心却并不平静。我本以为车子一停就会有人来接我。走下“擦靴的”[3]替我殷勤放好的短木梯，我焦急地四处张望，期待着有人能叫我的名字，期待着能看到有辆马车正等着把我送往桑菲尔德，然而都没有。我问一位侍者是否有人来打听过一位爱小姐，得到的回答是没有。别无他法，我只好请他们把我带到一个僻静的房间等待着，心中却疑虑重重，忐忑不安。

对一位涉世未深的年轻人来说，这是一种奇怪的感受，自己在世上孤身一人，切断了所有联系，对于能否到达目的地毫无把握，要返回出发点又障碍重重。冒险的魅力使这种感觉变得甜蜜，自豪的激情使它变得温暖，但随后到来的恐惧又使它变得不安。半小时过去了，我依然孤单一人，恐惧压倒了一切，我想到了按铃。

“这附近有没有个一个叫‘桑菲尔德’的地方？”我问应声而来的侍者。

“桑菲尔德？我不知道，小姐，我到吧台问问。”他走了，但很快又回来了。

“您是姓爱吗，小姐？”

“是的。”

“这儿有人在等您。”

我跳了起来，拿起皮手筒和伞，急忙走到旅店过道。有一个人站在敞开的门口，街上的路灯下，我依稀看到了一辆马车。

那人看见了我，指着过道上我的箱子，冷不丁地问我：“这就是您的行李，对吧？”

“是的。”他把箱子举起来放到了车上，这是一辆四轮马车。我坐了进去，不等他关门就问他到桑菲尔德有多远。

“大约六英里。”

“我们到那儿需要多长时间？”

“大概一个半小时。”

他关上车门，爬到车厢外面车夫的位置，我们便上路了。车夫不慌不忙地赶着马车，这让我有充分的时间来思考。想到终于快到目的地了，我很高兴，把身体放松地靠在虽不精致却很舒适的马车上，一时浮想联翩。

“我估计，”我想道，“不论是仆人还是马夫穿着装扮都很朴实，从这点来看，费尔法克斯太太应该不是一个衣着华丽的女人，这样倒更好。到现在为止我只和上等人一起生活过一次，那真是一段悲惨的经历。不知道她是否只和小女孩一个人生活。如果是这样，而且她还算友善和气的话，我肯定能和她好好相处，我会尽力而为。可让人遗憾的是竭尽全力并不是总能得到回报。其实在洛伍德，我就是这样想的，而且也一直是这样做的，最终赢得了别人的好感，但是在里德太太那里，我记得我的好心总是遭到鄙弃。上帝保佑啊，费尔法克斯太太可千万不要成为第二个里德太太。可如果她真是那样的话，我也并不是非与她相处下去不可，就是发生了最坏的情况，我还可以再登广告。不知道我们现在已走了多远了？”

我把窗子放下来向外望去，米尔科特已在我们身后。从灯光的数量来看，这似乎是一个相当大的城市，比洛伍德要大得多。现在马车好像在一片公地上行驶，不过这一带住满了人家。我感觉自己到了一个与洛伍德不同的地方。这里人烟更为稠密，熙熙攘攘，却没有洛伍德风景优美，充满浪漫。

道路难行，夜雾沉沉，车夫让他的马一路慢行。一个半小时过去了，两个小时过去了，终于他从车座上回过头来说：

“现在您离桑菲尔德不远了。”

我再次向窗外望去，马车正经过一个教堂，可以看见天空下低矮、宽阔的塔楼，教堂的钟声正缓慢悠长地敲响一刻；山腰上有一小片灯光，表明那是一个村庄，或者是一个没有教堂的小村子。大约十分钟后，车夫跳下车来，打开两扇大门让马车通过，门在我们身后砰地关上了。马车缓步走上车道，来到一幢房子面前。整个房子一片漆黑，只有一扇拉着窗帘的弓形窗中漏出点点微光。马车停在前门，一个女佣开了门，我从车上下来走了进去。

“请走这边，小姐。”女仆说。我跟着她穿过一个四周都是高门的方形大厅，走进一个灯火通明的房间。里面炉火烛光交相辉映，和我已经习惯了两小时的黑暗形成鲜明对比，一时令我眼花缭乱。等视力恢复正常以后，眼前出现了一幅温馨舒适的画面。

这是一个舒适的小房间，温暖的炉火旁摆着一张圆桌，一把老式高背安乐椅上，坐着一位再整洁不过的矮小老妇人，头戴寡妇帽，身穿黑色丝绸长袍，还围着雪白的平纹细布围裙，跟我想象中的费尔法克斯太太一模一样，只是不那么威严，却显得更加和蔼罢了。她正忙着编织，一只大猫娴静地蹲在她脚边。作为一幅理想的家居闲适图，它真是完美无缺了。对一个新来乍到的家庭女教师来说，也很难设想有比这更让人放心的初次见面的情景了。没有盛气凌人的豪华，也没有令人难堪的庄严。我一进门，那老妇人便立刻起身，客客气气地上前来迎接我。

“你好，亲爱的！恐怕一路坐车很乏味吧。约翰驾车又那么慢，你一定怪冷的，到火炉边来吧。”

“我想您就是费尔法克斯太太了？”我说。

“是呀，我是，请坐吧。”

她把我领到她自己的椅子上坐下，随后动手取下我的披巾，解开我的帽带，我请她不用如此麻烦了。

“啊，一点也不麻烦，你的手恐怕差点儿冻僵了吧。莉娅，调点儿热尼格斯酒，切一两片三明治。储藏室的钥匙在这儿。”

她从口袋里掏出一串井然有序的钥匙，递给了仆人。

“好啦，靠近火炉些吧，”她继续说，“你已经把行李带来了是吗，亲爱的？”

“是的，太太。”

“我来叫人搬到你房间去。”她说着，急急忙忙走了出去。

“她把我当客人来看待了，”我想，“我没有想到会受到这样的待遇。我以为只有冷漠与生硬。这不像我耳闻的家庭女教师的待遇。可是我也绝不能高兴得太早了。”

她回来了，亲自动手从桌上把她的编织工具和一两本书挪开，为莉娅端来的托盘腾出了地方。接着她亲自把点心递给我。我颇有些受宠若惊，自己从来没有受到过这样的关心，况且这种关心来自我的雇主和上司。可是看起来，她并没有认为自己做得有什么不妥，所以我也就认为自己还是默默地接受她的款待比较好。

“今晚我能有幸见一见费尔法克斯小姐吗？”吃完了她给我的点心后我问道。

“你说什么，亲爱的，我有些耳背。”这位好心的太太转过身来问道，把耳朵凑近我的嘴。

我把这个问题更清楚地重复了一遍。

“费尔法克斯小姐？噢，你指的瓦伦小姐！你要教的学生叫瓦伦。”

“是吗，那么说她不是您的女儿？”

“不是，我没有家人。”

我本想把第一个问题继续往下问，问问瓦伦小姐和她的关系，但又一想，觉得问这么多问题不太礼貌，而且以后我肯定也会知道这些问题的。

“我很高兴……”她在我对面坐下来，把那只猫放到膝盖上，继续说，“我很高兴你来了。有个伴儿，住在这儿，肯定会是一件愉快的事情。当然，在这儿什么时候都很愉快，桑菲尔德府是一个很好的老庄园，这几年人们也许有些淡忘了，但它仍然是一个受人尊重的地方。不过你知道，到了冬天，即使住在最好的地方你也会觉得沉闷无趣的。我是说一个人——莉娅当然是一位好姑娘，约翰夫妇也都是正派人。但是你知道他们总归是仆人，不便于与他们平等交谈，与他们保持适当的距离，免得失去威信。我肯定去年冬天——如果你还记得的话，那个冬天很冷，不是下雪，就是刮风下雨——从十一月到今年二月，除了卖肉的和送信的，没有别人到府上来过。我一夜一夜独自一人坐着，心情都很忧郁。有时我也让莉娅进来读些东西给我听，不过我想这个可怜姑娘并不喜欢这差使。她肯定觉得这样不太自由。春天和秋天到了以后，阳光和变长的白天使得情况好了很多。接着，秋天刚刚开始，小阿德拉·瓦伦和她的保姆来了，孩子的到来立刻使整幢房子充满了生机，现在你也来了，我的心情更愉快了。”

听了这位可敬的老妇人的话，我的心温暖起来，我把椅子向她身边挪了挪，真诚地希望她能发现，我是一位如她所愿的伙伴。

“不过今晚我不会留你太晚，”她说，“现在已经敲响十二点了，你奔波了一整天，一定很累，要是你的脚已经暖和过来了，我带你去卧室。我已经让人在我的隔壁房间给你收拾出来了一间卧室，是个小房间，但是我想，和前面的大房间比起来，你肯定会更喜欢它。虽然那些大房间里的家具的确更为精致，但是却孤独冷清，我自己从不在大房间里睡觉。”

对她周到细致的安排我表示感谢，但长途旅行之后，我的确已经疲惫不堪，便表示准备休息。她端上蜡烛走在前面，我跟着她走出房间，先去看大厅的门上了锁没有。她从锁上取下钥匙，领我上了楼梯。楼梯和扶手是橡木做的，楼梯上的窗子都是高高的花格窗，这种窗子和直通一间间卧室的长长过道，使整幢房子看上去更像一间教堂。楼梯和过道上散发出一阵阵寒意，给人一种空旷孤寂之感。因此当我终于被领进自己的房间，发现它面积不大，摆着普通的现代风格的家具时，心里十分高兴。

费尔法克斯太太跟我道了晚安。我闩上了门，目光随意四顾，刚才由那宽阔的大厅、漆黑空旷的楼梯和阴冷的长廊所造成的恐怖的印象，不觉已被这小房间的蓬勃生机抹去了不少。这时我忽然想到，经历了身心交瘁的一天之后，此刻我终于到达了一个安全的避风港，感激之情油然而生。我跪在床边开始祈祷，感谢理应感谢的上苍。在站起来之前，并未忘记祈求在前路上赐予我帮助与力量，使我配得上还没有付出努力就坦率地授予我的那份厚意。那夜，我的床榻上没有荆棘，我独居的房间里也没有恐惧。立刻，倦意与满足感笼罩了我，我很快便沉沉睡去，醒来时，天色已经大亮。

阳光从鲜艳的蓝色印花布窗帘缝隙中射进来，照出了糊着墙纸的四壁和铺着地毯的地板，与洛伍德光秃秃的楼板和的灰泥全然不同。相形之下，这房间显得小巧而明亮，眼前的情景使我精神为之一振。外在的表现形式对年轻人往往有很大影响，我觉得自己生命中更为光明的时代开始了，这里将会有荆棘和艰辛，也会有鲜花和欢愉。新的环境给了我新的希望，我的各种感官都被新改变的环境唤醒了。它们开始骚动，我也说不清楚它们具体在期待着什么，但肯定是令人愉快的事情，可能不是在某一月某一天，而是在不确定的未来。

我起床，认真地穿戴，只能是简朴——因为我没有一件衣服不是极其朴实的——但渴求整洁依然是我的天性。不注意仪容，不在乎形象，可不是我的习惯。相反，我一向希望自己的外表尽可能好一些，并希望在我平庸的外貌所允许的情况下，尽可能多得到别人的好感。有时候，我为自己没有长得漂亮些而感到遗憾，有时候希望自己有红润的双颊、挺直的鼻梁和樱桃般的小口。我希望自己拥有修长、端庄、匀称的身材。然而不幸的是，我身材矮小，苍白，五官不那么端正，又不引人注目。为什么我有这些希望却又有这些遗憾？这很难说清楚，当时我自己虽然说不上来，但是肯定有理由，而且是合乎逻辑、合乎常情的理由。然而，当我把头发梳得溜光，穿上那件黑色的外衣——虽然看上去确实像贵格会[4]教徒，但至少非常合身——整理好干净洁白的领布，我想我可以体面地去见费尔法克斯太太了，我的新学生至少不会因为厌恶而直往后退。我打开了房间的窗户，看到梳妆台上的东西收拾得整整齐齐，便壮起胆子走出门去。

走过铺着地席的长廊，走下光滑的橡木楼梯，我到了大厅。我停了下来，端详着墙上的几幅画（记得其中一幅画的是一个穿着护胸铁甲的威严男子和一个头发上搽了粉，戴着珍珠项链的贵妇），看了看从天花板上垂下来的青铜灯；看了看一个大钟，钟壳是橡木做的，上面刻着奇怪的花纹。年深月久，反复擦拭，大钟已似古木般乌黑发亮。这一切都显得那样庄严肃穆、富丽堂皇。不过，那时的我不大习惯于这种豪华。镶着大块玻璃的大厅门敞开着，我走了过去。这是一个天气晴朗的秋天的早晨，朝阳宁静地照耀着深褐色的小树林，照耀着依然翠绿的田野。我继续前行，走到了草坪，抬起头来，从正面仔细地观察这座大宅。它高三层，虽算不上宏大，却也是颇具规模。算得上是一座绅士的庄园，却够不上贵族的府第。围绕其顶端的防卫墙，使整座建筑别具风姿。灰色的正面正好反衬着一个白嘴鸦的巢穴，十分醒目。它的居住者正在边房呱呱叫着，展翅飞越草坪和庭园，落到一片草地上。一道矮篱把草地和庭园分开。草地上长着一排排巨大的老荆棘树丛，强劲多节大如橡树，一下子说明了这座府第名称的由来[5]。更远处是座座小山，不像洛伍德四周的山那么高耸峻峭，也不像它们那样是一道与世隔绝的屏障，但这些山十分幽静，仿佛将桑菲尔德拥抱在怀，给它带来了一种远离闹市的清静，一种在离喧闹的米尔科特地区如此之近的地方不曾想到的清静。一个小村庄零散地分布在一座小山的一侧，屋顶与树木相连。地区教堂坐落在桑菲尔德附近，它古老的钟楼俯视着房屋与大门之间的土丘。

我享受着宁静的景色、宜人的新鲜空气，愉快地倾听着白嘴鸦的呱呱叫声，细细打量着这所庄园宽阔灰白的正面，心想，偌大的一处宅院，居然只住着费尔法克斯太太这样一位孤单矮小的老妇人。就在这时，这位妇人出现在门口。

“怎么，已经出来了？”她说，“我看你是个喜欢早起的人。”我向她走去，她慈祥地吻了吻我，还握了握我的手。

“你喜欢桑菲尔德吗？”她问。我告诉她非常喜欢。

“是呀，”她说，“这儿是个美丽的地方。但我担心它会慢慢败落，除非罗切斯特先生心里还想着这儿，在这儿永久居住下来，想着要来，或者，至少是经常回来看看。大房子好庭园需要主人的出现。”

“罗切斯特先生！”我很吃惊，大声问道：“他是谁？”

“桑菲尔德的主人，”她平静地回答，“你不知道他叫罗切斯特吗？”

我当然不知道，而且以前从来没有听说过这个人。但是看起来，这位老妇人把他的存在看做众所周知的事实，所有的人仅凭直感就会知道的。

“我还以为，”我继续说道，“您是桑菲尔德的主人呢。”

“我是？上帝啊，我的孩子！这真是奇怪的想法！我是？我只不过是一个管家——管理人而已。其实，我是罗切斯特先生母亲的远亲，或者至少我丈夫是。他是靠近大门的那个教堂的牧师，是海村的——山上更远处的那个小村。现在的罗切斯特先生母亲的姓氏也是费尔法克斯，她的父亲和我丈夫的父亲是堂兄弟，但是我从来没有指望这层关系，其实这对我没什么影响。我只把自己当做一个普普通通的管家，我的雇主对我一直都很客气，而我也就没有什么别的要求了。”

“那个小女孩呢——我的学生？”

“罗切斯特先生是她的监护人，他委托我给她找一位家庭教师。他打算把她养大成人。你看，她和她的保姆[6]来了。”谜底被揭开了，这个和蔼亲切的老妇人并不是什么大家贵妇，和我一样，她也是主人的下属。但是我并没有因此而不喜欢她，相反，我感到更愉快了。我和她之间是真正的平等，而不是她的特意屈尊形成的。这样感觉就更好了，我的处境就更自由了。

我还沉思着自己刚才的发现时，一个小女孩向草坪这边跑过来了，后面还跟着她的保姆。我看着我的学生，她一开始并没有注意到我的存在。她十足是个孩子，大约有七八岁，身材瘦小，脸色苍白，五官纤巧，一头过长的鬈发垂到腰际。

“早上好，阿德拉小姐，”费尔法克斯太太说，“过来和这位小姐说说话，她会教你读书，让你将来成为一个聪明的姑娘。”她向我走过来。

“这是我的家庭教师吗？”[7]她指着我问她的保姆。保姆回答说：

“当然是。”[8]

“她们都是外国人吗？”听到他们在讲法语，我吃惊地问道。

“保姆是外国人，阿德拉出生在欧洲大陆[9]，而且我想她直到六个月前的时候才离开那儿。她刚到这儿来的时候，一句英语也不会讲，现在能讲一点了，可我还是听不懂，因为她的话里既有英语又有法语。但是我相信，你肯定能听懂她的意思。”

幸好我曾跟一位法国太太学习过法语，此时这成了我的有利条件。那时我总是尽可能地抓住一切机会与皮埃罗太太交谈。此外，在过去的七年中我还坚持每天背诵一段法文，在语调的学习上也下了不少工夫，尽可能逼真地去模仿老师的发音，因而我的法语已经相当流利相当准确，不至于应付不了阿德拉小姐。当她知道我是她的家庭教师后，便走过来和我握手。我带她进屋去吃早饭，用她的语言说了几句，起初她回答得很简短，但等我们在餐桌旁坐定后，她用淡褐色的大眼睛打量了我十来分钟之后，突然唧唧喳喳地说开了。

“啊！”她用法语叫道，“你说我的话就像罗切斯特先生说得一样好。我可以和你交谈了，像我可以和他交谈一样。索菲也可以和你交谈了，她会很开心的，因为这里没人能听得懂她的话，费尔法克斯太太满口英语。索菲是我的保姆，她和我一起坐一艘大轮船过来的，船上还有只烟囱一直冒烟，那烟真浓啊！我病倒了，索菲也病倒了，还有罗切斯特先生也病倒了。罗切斯特先生躺在一间漂亮的房间里的一张沙发上，这个漂亮的房间叫沙龙。索菲和我睡在另一个地方的小床上。我差点就从床上掉下来，它像个架子一样。小姐——你叫什么名字？”

“爱——简·爱。”

“埃尔？啊？我可说不好。嗯，我们的船在早晨停了下来，那时天还没有全亮，到了一个大城市，一个很大的城市，房子都很黑，全都冒着烟。一点也不像我原来住的城镇那样干净漂亮。罗切斯特先生抱着我穿过甲板，走到陆地，索菲在后面跟着我们。我们都坐进了一辆马车，到了一座美丽的大房子那儿，比这座房子还要大，还要好，叫做旅馆。我们在那里待了差不多一个星期，我和索菲每天都去散步，到一个很大的地方，里面种满了树，碧绿碧绿的，那儿叫做公园。除了我，那里面还有好多孩子，还有一个池塘，有很多漂亮的鸟，我用面包屑喂它们。”

“她讲得那么快，你能听懂吗？”费尔法克斯太太问我。

我完全能听得懂她的话，因为过去已经听惯了皮埃罗太太那流利的口齿。

“我希望，”这位善良的老妇人继续说道，“你问她一两个关于她父母的问题，不知道她是否还记得他们。”

“阿德拉，”我问，“在你刚才说的那个漂亮干净的镇上，你跟谁一起住啊？”

“很久以前我跟妈妈住在一起，可是她到圣母玛利亚那儿去了。妈妈过去经常教我跳舞唱歌，还教我朗诵诗歌。很多很多先生和太太来看妈妈，我常常跳舞给他们看，或者是坐在他们膝盖上，唱歌给他们听。我喜欢这样，我现在唱歌给你听，好吗？”

她已经吃过了早饭，所以我允许她表现一下。她爬下椅子，走过来坐到我的膝上。然后，一本正经地把小手交叠，把鬈发往身后一甩，抬眼望着天花板，开始唱起了某出歌剧中的一首歌。歌中唱的是：一个被遗弃的女人，对情人的绝情痛哭了一番之后，求助于自己的自尊，让她的仆人用最耀眼的首饰和最华丽的礼服，把她装扮起来，决定参加当晚的一个舞会，在那儿与那个负心人见面，以自己的轻松愉快向他证明，对于他的负心，她毫不在意。

一个儿童选择这样的歌来唱，真是奇怪。不过我想，要她表演的目的在于他们想听一听用童声唱出来的爱情和妒忌的曲调。这样做的目的本身就是低级趣味，至少我这样认为。

阿德拉把这支歌唱得悦耳动听，而且还带着她那种年纪才会有的天真烂漫。唱完以后，她从我膝头跳下来说：“小姐，现在我给你朗诵几首诗吧。”

摆好了姿势，她说：“《拉封丹[10]寓言·老鼠同盟》[11]。”随后朗诵了这首短诗，语调抑扬顿挫，婉转动听，动作得体，按她现在的年龄，做得相当出色，看得出她肯定受过严格的训练。

“这首诗是你妈妈教的吗？”我问她。

“是的，她总是这么说：‘你怎么啦？’一只老鼠问，‘说呀！’[12]她要我把手举起来——像这样——，还提醒我问问题的时候声音要大一点。现在我来跳舞给你看好吗？”

“啊，不用啦，这就行了。你刚才说的，你妈妈到圣母玛利亚那儿去了以后，你和谁一起住啊？”

“和弗雷德里克太太和她的丈夫。她照看我，但是她和我不是亲戚。我想她很穷，因为她不像妈妈那样有好房子。我在那儿待的时间并不长。罗切斯特先生问我，是否愿意和他一起到英国去住。我说好的。因为我在认识弗雷德里克太太之前就认识罗切斯特先生了。他一直待我很好，还送我漂亮的衣服和玩具，可是他根本就不遵守诺言，你瞧，他把我带到了英国，自己却又回去了，我再也没有见过他。”

早饭过后，我和阿德拉到了图书室。罗切斯特先生好像曾吩咐把这儿用做教室。大部分书籍都被锁在玻璃门内，有一个书架却是敞开的，上面摆着基础教育所需要的各类书籍，另外还有几部轻松的文学作品、诗歌、传记、游记和一些传奇故事。我想这些可能就是他认为家庭女教师个人想看的书。确实，现有的这些书已经使我非常满意了。与在洛伍德东拣西拣的少量书籍相比，这里算得上是知识和娱乐的大丰收了。在房间里还有一架小巧的钢琴，外观崭新，音质上乘。除此以外，还有一个画架和一对地球仪。

我发觉我的学生相当听话，虽然不大肯用功。她还不习惯于做任何固定不变的事。我觉得一开始就过多地限制她是不明智的。因此，我跟她谈了不少东西，让她学得却不多。临近中午时，就让她回保姆那儿去了。接下来的时间我打算画几幅小素描，供她日后学习用。

上楼去取画夹和铅笔时，费尔法克斯太太叫住了我：“我想你上午的课已经结束了吧。”她正在一个折门打开的房间里。听到她的招呼我走了进去。这是个豪华气派的大房间，紫色的椅子，紫色的窗帘，土耳其地毯，胡桃木镶板墙，色彩斑斓的大玻璃窗。高高的天花板，装饰得颇为华丽。费尔法克斯太太此时正给餐具柜上几只精美的紫晶石花瓶掸灰尘。

“这房间真漂亮！”我环顾四周，不觉惊叹起来。我所见过的最漂亮气派的房间也不及它的一半。

“是呀。这是餐室，我刚刚把窗子打开，好透进一点新鲜空气和阳光，这些房间难得有人住，都快发霉了。那边的客厅简直就像地窖。”

她指了指跟那窗子相对应的一扇宽大的拱门，上面挂着红紫色的窗帘，此刻拉了上来。跨过两步宽阔的台阶，我朝里一看，宛若仙境一般，眼前的景象让从未见过如此美丽景色的我眼前一亮。然而，它不过是一间漂亮的客厅，里面还有一间闺房。两间房子都铺着白色的地毯，上面仿佛摆着鲜艳夺目的花环。天花板上都雕刻着雪白的葡萄和葡萄叶子，与天花板下绯红的睡椅和软垫搁脚凳形成鲜明对比。灰白色的帕罗斯[13]大理石壁炉架上，波希米亚玻璃饰品如红宝石般闪闪发光。窗户之间的大镜子折照出雪白和鲜红两种色调的混合。

“这些房间收拾得真整齐洁净，费尔法克斯太太！”我说，“连帆布罩都没用，却是纤尘不染，如果不是这里的空气有点凉，还以为天天有人在这儿住呢。”

“噢，爱小姐，尽管罗切斯特先生很少回来，可是一旦回来就很突然，让人始料不及。我发现他最讨厌看到什么东西都裹得严严实实的，比起等他到了才开始手忙脚乱地收拾，我想还是提前把房间准备妥当比较好。”

“罗切斯特先生是不是那种爱挑剔、难于取悦的人？”

“也不完全是。不过他具有上等人的品位和习惯，并且希望按照他的品位和习惯做事。”

“您喜欢他吗？大家都喜欢他吗？”

“啊，是的。他的家族在这儿一向都受人尊敬。自从很久很久以前，这儿的所有土地，只要是你能望得见的，都是罗切斯特家的。”

“哦，不过，撇开他的土地不谈，您喜欢他吗？别人喜欢他吗？我是说他本人。”

“我没有理由不喜欢他。我相信他的佃户们也都认为他是个正直慷慨的地主，不过他从来没有和他们长待过。”

“但是他没有什么怪癖吗？或者是，他的性格如何？”

“啊，我想他的性格是无可指责的，或许是有些特别。我想他到过很多地方，见过很多世面。他一定很聪明，不过，我和他交谈得也不多。”

“他在哪方面有些特别呢？”

“我不知道——这很难说清楚——不是很明显，但是当他和你说话时，你就能感觉到。你不知道他的话是在开玩笑还是当真，他是高兴，还是不高兴。总之，你不能彻底了解他——至少我不能。但是这些没有关系，他是一个很好的主人。”

这就是我从费尔法克斯太太那儿听来的关于我们两个人的共同雇主的全部情况。有些人似乎不善于如何描述一个人，或者是不善于观察和描绘人和事的特点，显然，这位善良的老妇人就属于这类人。我被自己的疑问困扰着，她也没能给我所需要的答案。在她的眼中，罗切斯特先生就是罗切斯特先生，一个绅士，一位土地拥有者——别无其他。她不作进一步询问和探求，显然对我想进一步确切地了解他的性格的想法感到难以理解。

我们离开餐厅时，她提议带我去看看庄园里其他的房子。一路上我跟着她上楼下楼，对她钦佩不已，因为一切都安排得那么井然有序，妥帖漂亮。在我看来，宽敞的前房尤其豪华。还有三楼的一些房间，虽然阴暗低矮，却古色古香，也别有一番情趣。由于时尚的变迁，一度由楼下房间使用的家具，逐渐搬到了这里。从狭窄的窗扉投射进来的斑驳光影，映照着有上百年历史的床架；映照着橡木或胡桃木的柜子，上面雕刻着奇特的棕榈树枝和小天使头部，看上去很像各种希伯来约柜[14]；映照着一排排历史悠久、窄小高背的椅子；映照着更加古老的凳子，坐垫上明显还留着磨损了的刺绣，当年做绣活的手指化为尘土已经有两代之久了。这一切陈迹使桑菲尔德府三楼成了往事的家园、回忆的殿堂。白天我喜欢这儿的静谧、幽暗和古雅。不过晚上我可绝不想在那些宽大笨重的床上睡觉。有些床装着橡木门，可以关闭；有的挂着古老的英格兰帐幔，上面绣满了奇异的花朵，更为奇异的鸟和最为奇异的人。所有这些在苍白的月光下会显得更加古怪。

“仆人们睡在这儿吗？”我问。

“不，他们睡在后面的小房子里，这里没有人住。可以这样说，如果桑菲尔德府有鬼的话，这儿将是它们最容易出没的地方。”

“我也有这种感觉。这么说，这儿没有鬼了？”

“反正我从没听说过，”费尔法克斯太太笑着说。

“鬼的传说也没有？没有传奇或者是鬼故事？”

“我看没有。不过据说，罗切斯特家人在世时都性格暴烈，而非柔柔弱弱的，这也许就是他们至今仍平静地躺在墓中的原因吧。”

“是呀，‘经过了一场人生的热病，他们现在睡得好好的’[15]。”我喃喃地说，看到她要走，“您现在要去哪里呀，费尔法克斯太太？”

“到铅皮屋顶去走走，你愿意和我一起去那儿看看风景吗？”我继续跟在她后面，沿着狭窄的楼梯走上阁楼，再爬上扶梯，穿过活动天窗，到了桑菲尔德府的屋顶。这时我与白嘴鸦的领地已处于同一高度，能看到它们的巢穴里面。倚在防卫墙上，放目远眺，大地似地图般铺展，颜色鲜亮如天鹅绒般柔软的草坪，环绕在大厦灰色的宅基周围；如公园般宽广的田地在古老的树林间星罗棋布；深褐色枯萎的树林，被一条小径分割开来，上面长满了青苔，看上去比树上的叶子还绿；秋日下，门口的教堂、道路和寂静的群山一片恬静；地平线与祥和的天空与远处的地平线融为一体，蔚蓝的天空中夹杂着大理石般的珠白色。这番景色并无出奇之处，但一切都显得赏心悦目。当转过身，再次经过活动天窗时，我几乎看不清下扶梯的路了。与我刚才抬头观望的蓝色苍穹相比，与我兴致勃勃地俯瞰过、以桑菲尔德府为中心的阳光照耀下的树林、牧场和绿色群山相比，这阁楼便如墓穴一般漆黑了。

费尔法克斯太太逗留了片刻，闩上活动天窗。我摸索着找到了顶楼的出口，爬下狭窄的扶梯，在长长的过道上徘徊。这条过道把三楼的正房与后房隔开，低窄黑暗，仅在远远的尽头处开了一扇小窗，两排黑色的小门全都关着，活像蓝胡子[16]城堡里的一条走廊。

我正轻步往前走时，没想到在如此寂静的地方，竟然听见了一声刺耳的笑声。这笑声古怪、木讷、忧郁却又清晰。我停下脚步，这笑声也停止了。但片刻之后，笑声重新响起，而且声音越来越大，不像起初那样清晰却不大。尽管这声音不过来自一个房间，我完全可以指出是从哪扇门后发出来的，但笑声之大足可以在每个寂静房间中引起回声。

“费尔法克斯太太？”我大声叫道，因为这时正听见她走下楼梯。“您听见有人大笑了吗？那是谁呀？”

“很可能是某个仆人，”她回答说，“也许是格雷斯·普尔。”

“您听到了吗？”我再次问道。

“听到了，而且很清楚。我常常听到她笑，她在这儿的一间房子里做针线活，有时莉娅和她在一起，她们两个在一起总是闹嚷嚷的。”

笑声又响了起来，低沉而清晰，最后以古怪的嘟哝作为结束。

“格雷斯！”费尔法克斯太太叫道。

我真不希望有哪位格雷斯来应答，因为这笑声和我刚才听到的一样悲惨，一样不可思议。要不是正值中午，要不是鬼魂的出现从来不伴随奇怪的狂笑，要不是当时的情景和季节都不会带来恐惧，我肯定会迷信地心惊胆战。然而，事情表明，我如此吃惊真是可笑。

离我最近的一扇门开了，一个仆人走了出来，这是一个年龄在三十到四十之间的女人，她身材高大魁梧，有一头红发、一张冷漠丑陋的脸。实在难以想象还有什么幽灵比她更缺少传奇色彩，更不像鬼魂了。

“太吵啦，格雷斯。”费尔法克斯太太说，“别忘了对你的吩咐！”格雷斯默默地行了个屈膝礼，走回房间。

“她是我们雇来做针线活、帮助莉娅干家务的，”这位寡妇继续说道，“在某些方面她是不讨人喜欢，不过她活儿干得不错。顺便问一下，早上你跟你的学生相处得怎么样？”

于是我们的话题转到了阿德拉身上，一直谈到了下面明亮欢快的地方。阿德拉在大厅里迎着我们跑过来，一面还嚷嚷着：

“女士们，午饭摆好啦[17]！”又添了一句：“我都饿坏了[18]！”

我们发现午餐已经在费尔法克斯太太的房间摆好了，正等我们回去。

第十二章


在桑菲尔德府的平静开端，似乎预示着我未来的工作将会一帆风顺。对这个地方和这里的人进一步熟悉了以后，我发现的确如此。费尔法克斯太太和当初给我的印象一样，性格温和，心地善良，受过足够的教育，智力中等。我的学生非常活泼，虽然由于娇纵溺爱，有时倔犟任性，不过好在完全由我照管，任何方面都没有进行不明智的干预，打断我的培养计划，她也很快改掉了任性的小毛病，变得驯服可教了。她天赋一般，个性平平，不具备什么特殊的感觉或情趣让她超过一般儿童，不过也没有什么让她居于常人之下的缺陷和恶习。她取得了相当大的进步，我们两个之间建立了一种虽不是很深厚却也愉快的关系。她的天真烂漫，她想讨人喜欢做出的努力，反过来也多少激起了我对她的爱恋，我们两人对彼此都感到满意，相处也很和谐。

这些话，顺便说一句[1]，会被有些人视为过于冷淡，这些人怀有庄严的信条，认为孩子本有天使般的本性，承担孩子教育的责任人，应当对他们怀有偶像崇拜般的虔诚。不过我这样写并不是迎合父母的利己主义，不是附和时髦的高论，不是支持骗人的空谈。我说的只不过是真话而已。我真诚地关心着阿德拉的幸福和进步，默默地喜欢着这个小家伙，正如我对费尔法克斯太太的善良怀着感激之情一样，由于她对我默默的尊重以及她本人温和的心灵与性情，与她相处得也很愉快。

我想再说几句，谁要是高兴都可以指责我。我时常独自在庭院里散步，当我走到大门口顺着大路向外望时，或者在阿德拉和保姆做游戏、费尔法克斯太太在储藏室制作果冻时，我爬上三楼，推开顶楼的活动天窗，登上铅皮屋顶，顺着暗淡的地平线，极目远眺与世隔绝的田野和群山时，我渴望自己能拥有超越极限的视力，能看到那些至今只闻其名却不得一见的充满生机的繁华世界，城镇和地区。我还渴望拥有比现在更多的实际经验，接触比现在范围更广的与我兴趣相投的人，熟悉各种性格的人。我珍视费尔法克斯太太身上的美德，也珍视阿德拉身上的长处，但我相信世界上还有其他更为鲜明的美德。我所相信存在的事物，我都想亲眼看一看。

谁会指责我呢？毫无疑问，肯定会有很多人，而且我会被说成贪心不知足。我没有办法，躁动不安是我的天性，有时它也很令我痛苦。而我唯一的解脱办法就是，在三层楼过道上来回踱步。这里悄无声息，僻静冷清，可以任心灵的目光观察浮现在眼前的任何光明的景象——当然这些景象众多而灿烂；可以任心灵随着喜悦而起伏跳动，这种跳动在烦恼中使心灵膨胀，同时又以蓬勃的生命将它扩展。然而，我最大的快乐，是敞开心灵的耳朵，去倾听一个永远也不会结束的故事。这个故事由我的想象创造，并被连续不断地讲下去。这个故事里因为有我所向往却在实际生活中不曾经历的事件、生活、激情和感觉，而显得更加生动活泼。

说人类应当满足于平静的生活，是徒劳无益的。人类应当有所行动，倘若找不到，那就由自己来创造。成千上万的人注定要承受比我更沉寂的灭亡；还有成千上万的人在默默地与他们的命运抗争着。没有人知道除了政治反抗之外，还有多少抗争在人世间芸芸众生中酝酿着。一般人都认为女人应当平平静静，但是女人跟男人一样是有感觉的。她们需要发挥自己的才能，而且也像兄弟们一样需要有用武之地。她们对于过分严厉的束缚、过分绝对的停滞，和男人一样感到痛苦，比她们更享有特权的同类们，只有心胸狭窄者才会说，女人们只应当做做针线，织织长袜，弹弹钢琴，绣绣荷包。如果仅仅因为她们希望超越世俗认定的女性所应守的规范，做更多的事情，学更多的东西，就去谴责或讥笑她们，这未免显得自私轻率。

我这样独自一人时，时常听到格雷斯·普尔的笑声，同样的大声，同样的低沉，同样迟缓的哈哈大笑声，乍一听来，令人毛骨悚然。我也曾听到过她古怪的嘟囔声，比她的笑声更怪异。有些时候她则十分安静，但还有一些时候她就会发出令人费解的声音。有时候我会看到她从房间里出来，手里拿着脸盆、盘子，或者是一个托盘，下楼到厨房去，很快就回来，一般说来（唉，我浪漫的读者，请恕我讲述如此呆板的过程！）拿着一罐黑啤酒。人们对她发出古怪声音的好奇心，通常在看到她的外貌时就会消失得无影无踪。她面貌凶恶呆板，没有一点能引起人感兴趣的地方。我几次试图与她搭话，但她似乎是个少言寡语的人，回答往往只有一两个字，终于使我意兴全无了。

府上的其他成员，如约翰夫妇、女佣莉娅和法国保姆索菲都是正派人，但能力也一般。我经常和索菲说法语，有时也问她一些关于她祖国的事儿，但她显然不具备描绘和叙述的才能，回答往往乏味混乱，仿佛有意阻止而不是鼓励我继续发问。

十月、十一月和十二月过去了。第二年一月的一个下午，阿德拉感冒了，费尔法克斯太太代她来向我请假。阿德拉热切的表情，使我想起自己的童年时代，偶尔的假日显得多么宝贵。于是我同意了，觉得自己这样做很对。这一天天气虽然寒冷却很晴朗。我讨厌呆呆地坐在书房，消磨长长的整个上午。费尔法克斯太太刚写好了一封信要去邮寄。于是我戴好帽子，披了斗篷，自告奋勇把信送到海村去。在一个冬日的下午步行两英里路，也是一件惬意的事。我看到阿德拉舒舒服服地坐在费尔法克斯太太的客厅炉火边的小椅子上，给了她最好的蜡制娃娃（平时我用锡纸包好放在抽屉里）玩，身旁还有一本故事书在她烦了的时候可以调剂一下。她对我说：“早点儿回来，我的好朋友，亲爱的简小姐。[2]”我吻了她一下，算是对她的回答，然后就出发了。

地面坚硬，空气沉静，我独自走在路上。我走得很快，直到浑身暖和起来才放慢脚步，享受着此时此景带来的种种欢乐。此时已是下午三点，我经过钟楼时，教堂的钟正好敲响。此时之美在于天色渐暗，落日低垂，阳光惨淡。我走在离桑菲尔德一英里的一条小路上。夏天，这里野玫瑰盛开，秋天，坚果与黑草莓果实累累，就连现在，也还残留着珊瑚色珍宝般的蔷薇果和山楂果。但在冬日里，它最大的快乐却在于它的幽静和光秃秃的树木所透出的安宁。若微风徐来，在这里则无声无息，因为没有一枝冬青也没有一棵常绿树会发出婆娑声。光秃秃的山楂和榛灌木像小径中间磨圆了的白碎石一样寂静无声。小径两旁，只见田野，没有吃草的牛群。树篱间偶尔惊起的黄褐色小鸟，看上去像是忘记落下的零星枯叶。

这条小径顺坡而上，直达海村。走到一半路时，我在通往田野的台阶上坐了下来。用斗篷把自己紧紧裹住，把手捂在皮手筒里，尽管天寒地冻，却并不觉得很冷。几天前已经融化泛滥的小河，现在又重新冻结了。堤坝上结了一层薄冰，这说明天气还是很寒冷。从我坐的地方可以俯视桑菲尔德府，建有护城墙的灰色府第是低谷中最显眼的建筑，树林和白嘴鸦黑幽幽的巢穴映衬着西边的天际。我在这儿流连徘徊，直到太阳落入树丛，显出一片火红，才转身向东走去。

头顶处，初升的月亮悬挂于山顶，先是像云朵般苍白，但是很快又明亮起来，俯视着海村。海村掩映在树木之中，寥寥的烟囱里升起了袅袅青烟。这里与海村相距还有一英里，然而万籁俱寂，我可以清晰地听到村落轻微的动静，我的耳朵也听到了水流声，但来自哪个溪谷和深沟却无法判断。海村那边群山绵延，肯定会有许多山溪流过隘口。黄昏的宁静，更加衬托出近处溪流的叮咚声和远处的飒飒风声。

一个粗重的声音，遥远却又清晰，打破了细微的潺潺水声和沙沙的风声，这是一种确确实实的脚步声。刺耳的嘚嘚声，盖过了柔和的流水声。犹如在一幅画中，浓墨渲染的前景——大块峭岩或者一棵大橡树的粗壮树干，消融在茫茫远景中。青翠的山峦与明亮的地平线、斑驳的白云融为一体。

声音是从小路上传来的，一匹马过来了，蜿蜒的小路遮挡着它，但它越来越近。我正要离开台阶，但因为小路狭窄，只好坐下来让它先过去。那时我还年轻，脑海里有着种种光明和黑暗的幻想，记忆中的育儿室故事夹杂着其他的无稽之谈。这一切又在我的脑海中重新出现时，正在成熟的青春给它们增添了一种童年时所没有的活力，让它们栩栩如生。当这匹马越来越近，而我凝眸等待它在薄暮中出现时，我蓦地记起了贝茜讲的故事中有一个英格兰北部的精灵，名叫“盖特拉西”，形状像马，也像骡子，或是像一条大狗，在偏僻的道路上出没，有时还会袭击迟归的旅人，正如此刻这匹马向我驰来一样。

马已经很近了，但还看不见。这时除了嘚嘚的马蹄声，我还听见树篱下一阵骚动，紧靠地面的榛子树枝下，悄悄地溜出一条大狗，黑白相间的毛色衬着树木，使它极其清晰。这和贝茜故事里的“盖特拉西”何其相似。一个狮子一般的怪物，有着长长的毛发和巨大的脑袋，它从我身旁经过，却什么也没有发生。并没有像我担心的那样停下来，它用比同类更具智慧的奇特目光，抬起头来看着我的脸。那匹马紧随其后，这是一匹高头大马，马背上坐着骑手。那个人，的的确确是个人，他的出现立刻将我所想象的诡异气氛冲散了。“盖特拉西”总是独来独往，它的背上才不会有什么骑士。而且据我所知，尽管妖怪们虽然可能会化作不会讲话的野兽，却不大可能选一般人的躯体作为藏身之地。这根本不是什么“盖特拉西”，只不过是一位赶路人，想要抄近路到米尔科特去。他从我身边走过，我接着赶路。还没走几步，我便回过头来，因为我听到了一阵滑倒的声音，一声“怎么办，活见鬼！”和稀里哗啦落地翻滚的声音，引起了我的注意。这时人和马都已经倒在地上，是被路上结的冰滑倒了。那条狗又飞奔回来，看见主人处境困难，马儿也在呻吟，便狂吠起来，在暮霭中的群山间引起了回声，那吠声十分深沉，与它巨大的身躯倒是颇为相称。它嗅了嗅倒在地上的人和马，然后跑到了我的面前。它也只能如此，因为附近没有别人可以求助。我按照它的意思走到这位赶路人身旁，此刻他正从马身上挣脱下来，从他用力的样子来看，他的伤好像并不重。但我还是问了他：

“您是不是受伤了，先生？”

我觉得他是在诅咒着什么，但不能确定。然而，他其实是在说些客套话，以至于无法立即回答我。

“我能帮上什么忙吗？”我又问道。

“你就站在一边吧。”他一边说着一边爬了起来，先是呈跪姿，然后站了起来。我照着他说的做了。这时候马开始嘶叫跺脚，马蹄嘚嘚作响，狗也跟着狂吠起来，这一番景象把我有效地赶到了几码以外，但还不至于远到看不见整件事情的发展。最后总算万幸，马重新站了起来，狗也在它主人的吆喝声“别叫了，派洛特！”后闭上了嘴巴。此刻这位赶路人正弯着腰，摸了摸脚和腿，仿佛在试试它们是否安然无恙。显然还有什么部位疼痛，他步履蹒跚地走向我刚离开的台阶那儿，坐了下来。

我想当时我是很想帮忙，至少是装装样子，因为我又向他走近了。

“如果您受伤了，需要帮忙，先生，我可以去叫人，到桑菲尔德府，或者海村。”

“谢谢你，我能行，我的骨头没断，只不过是脚扭了。”他再次站起来，试着抬脚，却不由自主地“啊！”地叫了一声。

白昼的余光还没有完全散去，月光也越来越亮，我能很清楚地看到他。他身上罩着骑手披风，戴着皮毛领，系着钢扣子。看不清楚他的具体模样。但依稀可以看到，他大体中等身材，宽宽的胸膛，黝黑的面庞，浓密的眉毛，面容坚毅。从他的眼睛和紧锁的双眉中可以看到愤怒和挫败。他大约三十五岁，虽已不再年轻，但还没有步入中年。我并不害怕他，但还是有点儿腼腆。如果我面前是一位英俊潇洒的年轻绅士，我肯许不会如此大胆地站在他面前，无视他的漠然屡次向他提问，而且主动向他提供帮助。我平生很少看到英俊的青年，更没和他们说过一句话。我敬畏尊崇理论上的美丽、高雅、勇敢和魅力，但如果我在男性身上看到了这些品质，我也会本能地知道，它们不会也不可能与我身上的任何东西产生共鸣。我会像躲开大火、闪电，或者是别的虽然明亮却不讨人喜欢的东西一样，对它们避之不及。

如果在我和这位陌生人说话时，他笑容满面，富于幽默感，如果他愉快地谢绝了我的帮助，并表示感谢，我肯定会继续赶路，不会感到有什么责任也不会屡次向他提问。但是在这位紧皱眉头、冷漠粗暴的赶路人面前，我却坦然自若，因此当他挥手示意叫我离开的时候，我仍然不为所动，大声宣布：

“我不可能这样把您扔在这儿，先生。天这么晚了，这条路又这么偏僻，除非我看到您能骑上马。”

在我说话的时候，他一直看着我。而在这之前，他连正眼都没瞧过我。

“我觉得你应该自己回家，要是你的家在附近的话。你是从哪儿来的？”他问。

“就是下面那个地方，如果有月光，在外面待晚了我也一点都不害怕。如果您愿意的话，我很乐意为您去跑一趟海村。实际上，我也正要去那儿寄一封信。”

“就住在下面，你指的是不是有防卫墙的那幢房子？”他指着桑菲尔德府。这时月亮给桑菲尔德府洒下了一层银光，清晰地勾勒出它以树林为背景的苍白轮廓。而树林，在西边的天际衬托之下，似乎成了一大片阴影。

“是的，先生。”

“那是谁的房子？”

“罗切斯特先生的。”

“你认识罗切斯特先生吗？”

“不认识，我从来没有见过他。”

“他不经常住在那儿吗？”

“是的。”

“能告诉我他在哪里吗？”

“我不知道。”

“那么，你肯定不是桑菲尔德府里的用人了？你是——”他的话停了下来，目光掠过我和平时一样简单的穿着，此时的我披着黑色美利奴羊毛斗篷，戴着一顶黑水獭皮帽，这两件中的任何一件都没有太太的女佣们的衣服讲究，甚至连一半都赶不上。他似乎难以判断我的身份，我帮助了他。

“我是家庭教师。”

“啊，家庭教师！”他重复了一下，“真是见鬼，我竟然把这也忘了！家庭教师！”我的穿着再次成了他审视的对象。过了两分钟，他从台阶上站起来，刚一挪动，脸上就露出了痛苦的表情。

“我不能让你去找人帮忙，”他说，“不过如果你愿意的话，你本人倒可以帮我一点忙。”

“当然可以，先生。”

“有把伞我可以当拐杖用一用吗，有吗？”

“没有。”

“想办法抓住缰绳，尽量让它靠近我，你不会害怕吧？”

如果我是单独一人，要去碰一匹马，我肯定会害怕的，但是现在，我很乐意照他的话去做。我把皮手筒摘下来放在台阶上，向那匹高高的骏马走去。我竭力想抓住缰绳，但这匹马性子很烈，不让我靠近它的头部。我试了又试，却都劳而无功，我又很怕被它的前腿踩着。这位赶路人等着看了一会儿，终于大笑起来。

“我明白了，”他说，“山是永远搬不到穆罕默德这边来的[3]，因此你能做的，是帮助穆罕默德走到山那边去，我得请你到这儿来。”

我走了过去。“对不起，”他继续说，“出于需要，我不得不请你帮忙了。”他把手重重地放在了我的肩上，吃力地倚着我，一瘸一拐朝他的马走去。他一抓住缰绳，马立刻就服服帖帖了，他随即跳上马鞍，因为扭伤的脚又被拉了一下，他的脸上露出了痛苦不堪的表情。

“好啦，”他说，放松了紧咬着的下唇，“把马鞭递给我就行啦，在树篱下面。”

我找了一下，把马鞭找到了。

“谢谢你，现在你快去海村寄信吧，快去快回。”

他把带马刺的后跟一叩，马惊得竖起前蹄，而后疾驰而去，那条狗蹿上去紧追不舍，刹那之间，三者便消失了：





像荒野上的石南，

被一阵狂风卷走。[4]





我拾起皮手筒继续赶路，对我来说，这件事已经发生，而且已经成为过去。在某种程度上说，它既不重要，也不浪漫，更不有趣。不过，它标志着我单调乏味的生活有了一小时的变化。有人需要我的帮助，并且要求我的帮助，而我帮助了他。我很高兴自己做了点事情，尽管这件事情微不足道，稍纵即逝，但毕竟是积极的，而我已经厌倦了平时被动的生活方式。这张新面孔犹如一幅新画，被送进了我记忆的画廊，它与已经张贴在那儿的所有画都全然不同。第一，因为这是一位男性；第二，他又黑又强壮，又严厉。当我走进海村把信投到邮局的时候，这幅画仍然在我眼前浮现。我一路快步下山赶回家时，依然能看到它。我路过台阶时，驻足片刻，举目四顾，侧耳静听。感觉马蹄声会再次在小路上响起，一位身披斗篷的骑手，一条盖特拉西似的纽芬兰狗也会再次出现在我的眼前。但是我所能看到的只是我面前的树篱和一棵没有枝梢的柳树，静静地兀立着，迎接月亮的清辉；我所能听到的只是一阵微风在桑菲尔德府的树林间掠过；我朝微风拂过的方向俯视时，目光掠过桑菲尔德府的正面，一个窗户里亮起的灯光，提醒我时间已经不早了，于是我匆匆地向前走去。

我不太愿意再次跨进桑菲尔德府。踏进门槛就意味着回到了一潭死水之中。穿过寂静的大厅，登上黑洞洞的楼梯，寻找自己孤零零的小房间，然后去见平静如常的费尔法克斯太太，和她，也只能和她一人度过漫长的冬夜，这一切将彻底消除这次散步所带来的兴奋，用千篇一律静止生活的无形镣铐，重新把自己锁住。这种稳定安逸的生活，我再也难以欣赏。那时候如果我被抛进变幻无常、苦苦挣扎的生活风暴中去，如果艰难痛苦的经历能启发我向往我现在所深感不满的宁静生活，对自己会有多大的益处啊！是呀，它的好处正如一个久坐于“超等安乐椅”[5]的人，站起身来做了一次长距离的散步。就像在我这种情况下，在我现在这种情况下，希望走动走动，这和他希望走动一样，是很自然的事情。

我在门口徘徊，在草坪上徘徊，在人行道上来回踱步。玻璃门上的百叶窗已经关闭了，看不到窗子里面。我的目光与心灵似乎已从那幢阴暗的房子，从在我看来满是暗室的灰色洞穴中，退缩出来，到达了我面前的天地——万里无云的蓝色海洋。月亮正庄严地缓缓升起，离开先前藏身的山顶，将山峦远远地抛在下面，仿佛还在翘首仰望，一心要到达黑如子夜、深远莫测的天顶。那些闪烁着的繁星尾随其后，我望着它们不觉心灵震颤，热血沸腾。一些小事往往又让我们重返红尘。大厅里的钟已经敲响，这就够了。我告别了月亮和星星，打开边门，走了进去。

大厅内并不暗，因为大厅里的一盏高悬的铜灯点亮了，而且，暖融融的火光，映照着大厅和橡树楼梯最低几级的台阶。这红光是从大餐厅里射出来的，那儿的两扇门开着。壁炉里炉火通红，映照着大理石炉板和铜制的炉具，给紫色的帐幔和光洁的家具涂上了一层悦目的亮光。炉火也照亮了壁炉边的一群人，我还没有来得及看清楚他们，也没有来得及听清楚欢乐而嘈杂的声音——仿佛阿德拉的声音也夹杂其间，门就关上了。

我匆忙赶到费尔法克斯太太的房间，那儿也生着壁炉，不过没有点蜡烛，费尔法克斯太太也不见踪影。我却看到了一只黑白相间、酷似小路上遇到的“盖特拉西”的长毛大狗，正端端正正独自坐在地毯上，神情严肃地看着壁炉的火苗。它和那个“盖特拉西”如此相像，以至于我忍不住走上前叫了它一声“派洛特”，它立刻一跃而起，走过来嗅嗅我。我抚摸着它，它摇着硕大的尾巴。不过单独和它在一起时，这个家伙却显得有些让人恐惧，我不知道它是从什么地方来的。我拉了一下铃，想要一支蜡烛，同时也想了解一下这位来客。莉娅走了进来。

“这条狗是从哪儿来的？”

“它是和主人一起来的。”

“和谁？”

“跟主人，罗切斯特先生，他刚到。”

“真的！费尔法克斯太太和他在一起吗？”

“是的，还有阿德拉小姐。他们都在餐厅，约翰已经去请医生了。主人出了点事，他的马摔倒了，他扭伤了脚踝。”

“他的马是在海村的路上摔倒的吗？”

“是呀，是在下山的时候，在冰上滑了一下。”

“啊！给我一支蜡烛好吗，莉娅？”

莉娅把蜡烛送来了，进门时后面还跟着费尔法克斯太太，她把刚才的新闻又重复了一遍，还说卡特大夫已经来了，现在正和罗切斯特先生在一起。然后又匆匆出去吩咐上茶点，我走上楼脱下外出时穿的装束。

第十三章


那天晚上，罗切斯特先生大概是按照医生的嘱托，早早地就上床休息了，第二天早晨也没有早起。他下楼是为了处理事务，他的代理人和一些佃户到了，等着和他说话。

阿德拉和我现在得把图书室腾出来，这儿要用做日常来访者的接待室。楼上的一个房间生起了火，我把书搬到那里，把那儿作为将来的教室。早上我发觉桑菲尔德变了样，不再像教堂那般安静，而是每隔一两个小时就会响起敲门声或拉铃声，还时常有脚步声穿过大厅。楼下不时传来不同声调的陌生的声音，一条潺潺溪流从外面的世界流进了桑菲尔德府，这里有了主人。就我来说，我更喜欢这样。

那天给阿德拉上课真不容易。她无法专心，老是往门口跑，扶着栏杆向下张望，看看能不能看上罗切斯特先生一眼。她还编出种种借口，要到楼下去，我一猜就知道她是想到书房去看看，我知道那儿并不需要她。后来，我有些生气了，让她乖乖地坐着，她嘴里不停地说着她的“朋友，爱德华·费尔法克斯·罗切斯特先生[1]”，她这样称呼他（我以前从没有听说过他的教名），还想象着他给她带来了什么礼物。因为他似乎在前天晚上提起过，他的行李从米尔科特运到后，里面会有一个小盒子，阿德拉特别想知道盒子里装的是什么。

“这就是说，盒子里面有一件给我的礼物，也许还有一件是给你的呢，小姐。先生说起过你，他问我我的家庭教师叫什么名字，问你是不是长得很矮小、比较瘦，而且面色有点儿苍白。我回答说是的。因为这是真的，对吧，小姐？”

和往常一样，我和我的学生在费尔法克斯太太的客厅里用餐。下午风雪交加，我们就待在教室里。天黑时我允许阿德拉放下书本和作业，跑到楼下去，因为下面已经比较安静，门铃声也不再响起，现在罗切斯特先生可能有空了。房间里只剩下我一个人，我走到窗子跟前，可什么也看不见。暮色和雪花把空气变得不再透明，连草坪上的灌木丛也看不清楚了。我放下窗帘，回到了火炉边。

在明亮的余烬中，我仿佛看到了一种景象，像是记忆中莱茵河畔的海德堡。这时费尔法克斯太太闯了进来，搅碎了我正在拼凑的火焰镶嵌图，也驱散了我孤独时涌上心头的不受欢迎的忧愁。

“如果今天晚上你和你的学生一起到休息室用茶点的话，他会非常高兴的。”她说，“罗切斯特先生今天太忙了，要不他会早点见你的。”

“他什么时间用茶点？”我问。

“哦，六点钟。在乡下他总是早起早睡，你最好现在就去换件外衣。我陪你一起去，帮你扣扣子，给你蜡烛。”

“有必要换外衣吗？”

“当然，最好还是换换。罗切斯特先生在这儿的时候，我晚上都穿晚礼服。”

这额外的礼节似乎过于庄重，不过我还是回了自己的房间。在费尔法克斯太太的帮助下，把黑色呢衣脱下来，换上了一件黑丝绸衣服，这是除了那一套淡灰色衣服以外——以我的洛伍德的服饰观念而言——我最好的也是唯一一套额外的衣服。我觉得那件灰色的衣服，除了头等重要的场合，是过于讲究而不宜穿着的。

“你还需要一枚胸针。”费尔法克斯太太说。我只有一件珍珠小饰品，是坦普尔小姐作为临别礼物送给我的，我把它戴上下了楼。不习惯见生人的我，觉得这么一本正经被罗切斯特先生召见，简直就是受罪。去餐室时，我让费尔法克斯太太走在我前面，自己则尽量走在她的暗影里，穿过此时已放下门帘的拱门，到了另一间高雅精致的套间。

桌上点着两支蜡烛，在壁炉台上还有两支蜡烛。派洛特躺在地上，沐浴在炉火的光与热中。阿德拉跪在它的旁边，罗切斯特先生半倚在长沙发上，脚下垫着坐垫。他正注视着阿德拉和狗，火光照亮了他的面庞。我认得出我见过的这位赶路人的浓密宽阔的眉毛，方方的额头，在上面横梳的黑发的衬托下，额头显得更加方正了。我认得他那坚毅的鼻子，与其说是因为英俊，不如说是因其个性。他的大鼻孔，我认为，表明他容易发怒。他那严厉的嘴唇、下巴和颚骨，对，都很严厉，一点都不错。我发现，他的身材，此刻已经脱去了斗篷以后，和他方方正正的容貌倒是颇为相配。从运动学术语来看算是好身材吧——胸宽腰细，虽然既不高大也不优美。

罗切斯特先生肯定已经知道，费尔法克斯太太和我走进了房间，但他似乎并不想看我们，因为我们走近时，他连头都没有抬。

“爱小姐来了，先生。”费尔法克斯太太语调轻柔地说。他点了下头，目光依旧没有离开狗和孩子。

“让爱小姐坐下吧。”他说，僵硬勉强地点点头。那不耐烦却又不失礼的说话语气，似乎想进一步表示：“爱小姐来不来和我有什么关系？真是见鬼，现在我可不想和她打招呼。”

我坐了下来，不再窘迫。颇为客气地接待我，反倒会使我手足无措，因为对我来说，无法报之以温良谦恭。而粗鲁任性可以使我不必拘礼，相反，行为古怪又合乎礼仪的沉默，却给我带来了方便。此外，这接待客人的反常方式也颇有意思，我饶有兴趣地看事情如何发展下去。

他仍像塑像一般，既不说话，也不动。大概费尔法克斯太太认为总得有一个人随和些，于是便先开口说起话来，照例和和气气，也照例是那老一套。对他一整天都忙于处理事务表示慰问，说他的脚扭伤了肯定很痛苦，然后又称赞他承受这一切的耐心与毅力。

“太太，我想喝点儿茶。”这是她所得到的唯一的回答。她赶忙去打铃，托盘端上来时，她又殷勤麻利地动手摆好杯子、茶匙等等。我和阿德拉走近桌子，但是主人并没有离开他的长沙发。

“你把罗切斯特先生的杯子端过去好吗？”费尔法克斯太太对我说，“阿德拉没准儿会把茶洒出去。”

我按她的要求做了。他从我手里接过杯子时，阿德拉也许认为可以趁机为我提出一个要求，她叫道：

“先生，您的小盒子里是不是有件礼物要送给爱小姐？”

“谁说过有礼物[2]？”他语气生硬地说，“你盼望一份礼物吗，爱小姐？你喜欢礼物吗？”他仔细地打量着我的脸，目光看起来阴沉恼怒而尖刻。

“我说不上来，先生，我对这些东西没有什么经验，一般认为是讨人喜欢的。”

“一般认为？但是你认为呢？”

“我需要一些时间，先生，才能给您一个值得您接受的回答。一件礼物可以从不同的角度去看它，是不是？人们需要在全面考虑之后，才能对礼物的性质提出自己的看法。”

“爱小姐，你不像阿德拉那么单纯，她一见到我就嚷着要‘礼物[3]’，而你却拐弯抹角。”

“因为我对自己是否有资格得到礼物，不像阿德拉那么有信心。她可以凭借彼此熟悉，也可以凭借着往常的习惯提出要求，因为她说过，你过去经常送给她玩具，可是要让我提出点理由来，我就不知道该说什么了，因为我是一个陌生人，没有做过什么应得到报答的事情。”

“啊，别以过分的谦虚来搪塞！我已经检查过阿德拉的功课，发现你为她下了很大的工夫，她并不聪明，也没有什么天分，但在短期内取得了很大进步。”

“先生，你已经给了我‘礼物[4]’，我很感谢您，赞扬学生的进步，是教师们最向往的酬劳。”

“哼！”罗切斯特先生哼了一声，默默地喝起茶来。

“坐到火炉边来。”主人说。这时托盘已经端走，费尔法克斯太太退到角落里忙着编织，阿德拉拉着我的手在房间里转来转去，指给我看那些放在螺形托脚小桌和柜子上的漂亮的书籍和饰品，我们遵命走过去。阿德拉想坐在我膝上，可罗切斯特先生吩咐她去和派洛特玩。

“你在我家住了三个月了吧？”

“是的，先生。”

“你是从——”

“××郡的洛伍德学校。”

“噢！一个慈善机构。你在那里待了几年？”

“八年。”

“八年！你的生命力一定很顽强。我还以为在那种地方就是待上你待的一半的时间，任何人的身体都会被搞垮的！难怪你看上去像是从另外一个世界来的。我一直都很奇怪，你从哪儿得来了这副面孔。昨天晚上我在海村路上碰到你的时候，不由得想到了一些神话故事，差点儿就想问你，是不是给我的马施了魔法，我现在还在怀疑。你的父母是谁？”

“我没有父母。”

“从来没有过，我想，你还记得他们吧？”

“不记得。”

“我想也记不得了。所以你坐在台阶上等你的同伴？”

“等谁，先生？”

“等绿衣仙人呗，晚上月光皎洁，正是他们出现的时间。是不是因为我冲破了你们的圈子，你就在路面上撒下了那该死的冰？”

我摇了摇头。“绿衣仙人一百年前就离开了英格兰，”我也像他一样一本正经地说，“而且，不管是在海村的路上还是在周围的田野里，您都找不到他们的一丝踪迹。我看不管是夏天、秋天还是冬天，月亮再也不会照耀他们的狂欢了。”

费尔法克斯太太放下手里的织物，抬起眉毛，似乎在奇怪这是哪种谈话。

“好吧，”罗切斯特先生继续说道，“要是你没有父母，总应该有些别的亲人吧，比如叔叔或者是姨妈等等？”

“没有，我从来没见过。”

“那么你家在哪儿？”

“我没有家。”

“你兄弟姐妹住在哪儿？”

“我没有兄弟姐妹。”

“谁推荐你到这里来的呢？”

“我登了广告，费尔法克斯太太给了我答复。”

“是这样的，”这位好心的太太说道，现在她终于知道我们在谈什么了，“我每天感谢主引导我做出了这个选择。爱小姐是我难得的伙伴，又是阿德拉和善细心的老师。”

“别忙着给她做鉴定了，”罗切斯特先生回答说，“赞美之词也不能让我偏听偏信，我会自己做出判断。她最初给我的印象就是把我的马弄倒在地。”

“先生？”费尔法克斯太太说。

“我得感谢她使我扭伤了脚。”

这位寡妇听得莫名其妙。

“爱小姐，你在城里住过吗？”

“没有，先生。”

“你认识的人多吗？”

“以前除了洛伍德的学生和教师，没有接触过别人。现在多了桑菲尔德府里的人。”

“你读过很多书吗？”

“只是碰到什么书就读什么书，数量不多，也不高深。”

“你过的简直就是修女的生活，毫无疑问，你在宗教礼仪方面受过严格的训练。布罗克赫斯特，我知道是他管辖着洛伍德，他是位牧师，是吗？”

“是的，先生。”

“你们这些姑娘也许都很崇拜他，就像整个修道院的修女都崇拜她们的院长一样。”

“哦，不。”

“你倒是很冷静！不！一个见习修女不崇拜她的牧师！这听起来有些亵渎神灵。”

“我不喜欢布罗克赫斯特先生，有这种感觉的不只我一个人。他是个很严酷的人，既自负又爱管闲事，他剪掉了我们的头发，而且为了省钱，给我们买质量很差的针线，大家简直都没法儿做针线活。”

“那种节省可不合算。”费尔法克斯太太议论道，此刻她又听懂了我们的话题。

“而这就是他最大的罪状？”罗切斯特先生问。

“他还让我们挨饿，那时他主管伙食，而委员会还没有成立。他每个星期都要给我们做一次长篇大论的讲道，我们都厌烦透了。每天晚上还要我们读他自己编的书，写的都是一些关于暴死呀，报应呀，吓得我们都不敢睡觉。”

“你去洛伍德的时候几岁？”

“大概十岁。”

“你在那里待了八年，也就是说你现在是十八岁？”

我表示同意。

“你看，算术还是有用的。没有它的帮助，我很难猜出你的年龄。像你这样五官与神情差别那么大，要确定你的年龄可不容易。好吧，你在洛伍德学了些什么？你会弹钢琴吗？”

“会一点儿。”

“当然，都是这样回答的，到图书室去——我的意思是说，如果你愿意的话——请原谅我命令的口气，我已经习惯于说‘这样做’，别人就这样做了。我无法为一个府上新来的人改变我的老习惯——那么，到图书室去，带上蜡烛，让门开着，坐在钢琴面前，弹上一曲。”

我听从他的吩咐去了。

“可以了！”几分钟以后，他大声说道，“你的确是会一点儿，我知道了，和别的任何一个英国女学生一样，也许比她们有些人好一些，但还不够好。”

我合上钢琴，走了回来。罗切斯特先生继续说：

“今天早上阿德拉给我看了几张素描，她说是你画的，我不知道它们是否全部都是由你一个人画的，也许是有哪个老师帮助了你？”

“没有，的确没有！”我脱口而出。

“啊，这话刺伤了你的自尊。好吧，把你的画夹拿过来，如果你能保证里面的画都是你自己创作的。不过，没有把握就不要保证，拼拼凑凑的东西我肯定能看出来。”

“那我什么也不说，您可以自己去判断，先生。”

我从书房取来了画夹。

“把桌子移过来。”他说，我把桌子推到了他的长沙发跟前，阿德拉和费尔法克斯太太也都走近来看画。

“别都挤过来，”罗切斯特先生说，“等我看好了，你们可以从我手里把画拿过去，但是别把你们的脸离我这么近。”

他仔仔细细地看了每幅画作。把其中三幅单独放在一旁，其余的看完以后便推开了。

“把它们放到别的桌子上去，费尔法克斯太太，”他说道，“和阿德拉一起看看吧。你——（他扫了我一眼）还坐到你的位子那儿，回答我的问题。看得出来这些画儿都是出自一人之手，是你的手吗？”

“是的。”

“你什么时候抽出时间来画的？这些画很费时间，也得费些心思去构思。”

“在洛伍德的最后两个假期画的，那时我没有别的事情做。”

“你从哪儿弄来的摹本？”

“从我的脑袋里。”

“就是现在我看到的你肩膀上的那个吗？”

“是的，先生。”

“那里面还有其他类似的东西吗？”

“我想也许有。我希望——还有更好的。”

他把这些画铺在他面前，再一次挑着看。

趁他忙于看画的时候，读者，我要告诉您，那是些什么画。首先我得声明，它们并没有什么了不起。画的题材的的确确是在我的脑海里生动地浮现出来的。在我把它们具体表现出来之前，仅仅用我心灵的目光看到它们时，它们的确是很动人的。然而在真正落笔时，我的手却不听我想象的使唤，每次都只能将想象中的东西勾勒成一个苍白无力的图像。

这几张都是水彩画。第一张画的是，低垂的乌云在波涛汹涌的海面上翻滚，远处的一切全都隐没在黑暗中，前景也是如此，或者不如说是，靠得最近的波涛也是如此，因为画中没有陆地。一道微光照亮了半沉入水的桅杆，桅杆上栖息着一只又黑又大的鸬鹚，翅膀上沾着斑驳的泡沫，嘴里衔着一只镶嵌了宝石的金手镯，我给手镯用上了调色板所能调出的最明亮的色调，而且，用我的铅笔所能勾画出来的最清晰的轮廓表现出来。在鸟和桅杆下面的碧波里，隐约可见一具沉溺的尸体，身上唯一能看得清楚的是一条美丽的胳膊，那手镯就是从这里被水冲走或被鸟儿啄下来的。

第二张画的背景只有一座朦胧的山峰，青草和树叶似乎被微风吹得倾斜着。远处和上面展开了一片薄暮时分深蓝色的浩瀚天空。高高耸入云端的是一个女人的上半身，我把色调尽可能弄得柔和幽暗。她暗淡的额头上像戴着王冠似的戴着一颗星，下面的脸仿佛只是透过朦胧的雾气隐隐显露。她双目乌黑，炯炯有神，神情狂野。头发如阴影一般飘洒下来，仿佛是被风暴或者是闪电撕下的一片暗淡无光的云块。脖子上有一抹宛若月色的淡淡反光，一片片薄云也有着同样浅色的光泽，金星的幻影就是从那里低头升起的。

第三幅画的是一座冰山的尖顶，刺破了北极冬季的天空，一束束北极光沿着地平线密集地竖起朦胧的长矛。近景上，一个头颅赫然出现，一个奇大无比的头，朝冰山低垂着，靠在冰山上面，把这一切都远远地抛在后面。两只瘦瘦的手合在一起支着额头，拉起了脸下半部的黑纱。额头毫无血色，苍白如骨。一只凹陷的眼睛一动不动地凝视着，满是绝望与木然。在两鬓之上，黑色缠头布的皱褶中，有一圈如云雾般变幻莫测的白色火焰在闪闪发光，上面还镶嵌着更为耀眼的点点火花，这淡淡的新月是“王冠的写照”[5]，戴王冠的便是“无形的形体”[6]。

“在画这些画时，你心情愉快吗？”看完画儿后，罗切斯特先生问道。

“我全神贯注，先生。是的，我很愉快。总之，画这些画等于是享受我从未经历过的最大乐趣。”

“这倒是讲得不过分，按照你自己说的情况来看，你的乐趣并不多。不过我相信你在调试安排这些奇怪的颜色时，肯定生活在一种艺术家的梦境之中，你每天要花很长时间坐着画这些画吗？”

“因为放假，我没有别的事情可做，我坐着从早上画到中午，从中午画到晚上。仲夏白天很长，我比较容易专心致志地工作。”

“你对自己这样饱含热情的劳动成果满意吗？”

“不太满意。我为自己所想的和实际画出来的东西存在的差距而苦恼。每次我都想象了一些东西，却苦于没有能力加以表达。”

“不完全如此。你已经画到了你思想的影子，但也许仅此而已。你缺乏足够的艺术技巧和专门知识，把它们淋漓尽致地表达出来。不过对一个女学生来说，这些画已经很难得了。至于那些构思，倒是有些古怪。那幅金星中的眼睛你一定是在梦中看见的，你怎么能使它那么明亮，又不耀眼呢？因为眼睛上端的那颗星星淹没了它们的光。它们那么庄严深邃又包含着什么意思？是谁教你画风的，天空中和那座山峰上都刮着大风。你在什么地方见到拉特莫斯山[7]的？——因为那确实是拉特莫斯山。好，把画儿拿走吧！”

我刚把画夹上的绳子扎好，他看了看表，突然说：

“已经九点了，爱小姐，你还在干什么，让阿德拉待到这么晚？带她去睡觉。”

阿德拉走出房间之前过去吻了吻他，他接受了这种亲热，但似乎并不比派洛特更欣赏它，甚至还不如派洛特。

“现在，我祝你们大家晚安。”他说着，朝门的方向做了个手势，表示他对我们的陪伴已经感到厌烦，希望打发我们走。费尔法克斯太太收起了她的织物，我拿起了画夹，我们向他行了屈膝礼。他冷冷地点了点头，算是回答，于是我们就退了出去。

“您说过罗切斯特先生并不是特别古怪，费尔法克斯太太。”安顿好阿德拉上床后，我再次到了费尔法克斯太太的房间里时说。

“怎么？他古怪吗？”

“我看是这样，他变幻无常，态度生硬。”

“不错。毫无疑问，在一个陌生人看来，他似乎是这样。但我已经非常习惯他的态度了，因此从来不去想它。更何况如果他真的是脾气古怪的话，那也是情有可原的。”

“为什么？”

“一半是因为他生性如此——谁都对自己的天性毫无办法；另一半毫无疑问是因为老是有一些痛苦的心事折磨着他，让他心绪不宁。”

“什么事情？”

“一方面是家庭纠葛。”

“可是他根本就没有家庭。”

“不是说现在，是曾经有过——至少是亲戚。几年前他失去了他的哥哥。”

“他的哥哥？”

“是的，现在的这位罗切斯特先生拥有这份产业的时间并不长，也就是九年左右的时间。”

“九年的时间也不算短了，他那么爱他的哥哥，直到现在还为他的去世而伤心不已吗？”

“唉，不——也许不是。我想他们之间有些什么误会。罗兰特·罗切斯特先生对爱德华先生不太公平，也许他还使他们的父亲对爱德华先生也抱有偏见。这位老先生很爱钱，一心想让家产保持完整，不希望因为分家而把产业缩小。同时又很想让爱德华先生拥有自己的一份财产，以保持这名字的荣耀。在爱德华先生成年后不久，他们采取了一些不太合理的办法，造成了很大麻烦。为了让爱德华先生也获得一份财产，老罗切斯特先生和罗兰特先生联合起来，使爱德华先生陷入了他认为痛苦的境地，具体是什么境地，我始终不太清楚。但在精神上他无法忍受不得不忍受的一切。他不是一个善于忍让的人，于是和家庭断绝了关系。多年以来，他一直过着一种漂泊不定的生活。自从他哥哥没有留下遗嘱就去世、他成了这份产业的主人以后，我想他在桑菲尔德府上连续住的时间从未超过两个星期。再说，的确，也难怪他要躲避这所老宅子。”

“他为什么要躲避呢？”

“也许他认为这地方让人感觉沉闷吧。”

这个回答显得含糊其辞。我很想了解得更清楚一些，但是费尔法克斯太太或许是不能，或许是不愿意，向我进一步提供关于罗切斯特先生痛苦的原因和性质。她坚持说，这对她本人来说也是个谜，她所知道的多半是她自己的猜测，看上去她的确希望我放下这个话题，所以我也就不再多问了。

第十四章


接下来的几天里，我很少见到罗切斯特先生。早上他似乎忙于事务，下午从米尔科特及其附近一带来的绅士拜访他，有时留下和他一起吃晚餐。等他的伤势好一点，可以骑马时，他经常骑马外出，可能是去回访，因此他常常直到深夜才回来。

这段时间，连阿德拉也很少被他叫去。我和他的见面，仅仅限于在大厅里、楼梯上或走廊上的偶然相遇。在这种场合，他有时高傲而冷淡地从我身边走过，只远远地点点头或者是冷冷地看我一眼，表示承认了我的存在，而有时却很有绅士风度，谦虚有礼地鞠躬微笑。我并没有因为他情绪变化而生气，因为我明白这些变化与我无关，他情绪起伏的原因与我毫不相干。

一天，他留客人吃晚饭，派人来取我的画夹，这无疑是要让人家看看里面的画。绅士们走得很早，费尔法克斯太太告诉我，他们要到米尔科特去参加一个公众大会。不过那天晚上风雨交加，天气寒冷，罗切斯特先生没有同他们一起去。客人们走后不久，他便打铃，说让我和阿德拉到楼下去。我把阿德拉的头发梳好，把她打扮得整整齐齐的，至于我自己，确信自己平时这身贵格会教徒的打扮没有什么可以再修饰的了——一切都严谨而朴素，包括辫起来的头发在内，不可能再有什么凌乱的地方了——然后我们走下楼去。阿德拉正疑惑着，不知道她的小盒子[1]到了没有。可能是出了什么差错，它直到现在还迟迟未到。她满意了：我们走进餐厅时，桌子上放着一个小盒子。阿德拉似乎凭直觉就知道了。

“我的盒子！我的盒子！[2]”她朝它跑过去，嘴里大声嚷着。

“是的，你的盒子[3]终于到了，拿到角落里去看吧，你这位地道的巴黎女孩，去把里面的东西拿出来自己开心吧。”罗切斯特先生的声音深沉而带有讥讽意味，这声音是从火炉旁巨大的安乐椅深处发出来的。“而且，你还要记住，”他继续说道，“别拿拆盒子的任何细节，或者是盒子内容情况的任何报告来打搅我，你自己安安静静地摆弄吧——要安静一些，孩子，懂吗？[4]”

阿德拉似乎并不需要警告，她已经带着她的宝贝退到了一张沙发上，正忙着解开系住盒盖的绳子。清除完这层障碍，揭起银色包装薄纸，一个劲儿地大叫着——

“噢，天哪！多漂亮啊！”然后便心花怒放地全神贯注地盯着看起来。

“爱小姐来了吗？”这时这位主人问道，一边从坐椅上欠起身子，回过头来看看门口，我仍站在门旁。

“啊！好吧，到前面来，坐在这儿。”他把一把椅子拉到自己椅子的旁边。“我不太喜欢听孩子们唧唧喳喳地说话，”他继续说道，“因为像我这样的老单身汉，他们口齿不清的话，不会引起我什么愉快的联想。整个晚上和一个小孩子面对面地度过，对于我来说实在是一件难以忍受的事情。别把椅子拉得那么远，爱小姐。就坐在我放的地方——当然，如果你愿意的话。让那些礼节见鬼去吧！我老是把它们给忘了。我也不太喜欢头脑简单的老太太。顺便说一句，我得把我们这儿的这一位放在心上，她可是怠慢不得。她是费尔法克斯家族的，或者说是嫁给了一个姓这个姓的。据说血总是浓于水的嘛。”

他打铃派人去请费尔法克斯太太，很快她就来了，手里还提着她的编织篮。

“晚上好，太太，我请你来做件好事。我不允许阿德拉跟我谈礼物的事，她已经憋了一肚子的话了，你做做好事听她讲讲，和她说说话，这样你就做了一件天大的好事了。”

果然，阿德拉一见到费尔法克斯太太，就把她叫到沙发旁，很快在她的膝上就摆满了她从盒子里掏出来的“礼物[5]”，瓷的，象牙的，蜡制的，一边还用她学到的那一点蹩脚的英语，滔滔不绝地加以解释，告诉她自己有多开心。

“现在我已扮演了一位好主人的角色，”罗切斯特先生继续说道，“让我的客人们都各得其所，彼此都有乐趣。我应当有权关心一下自己的乐趣了。爱小姐，再把你的椅子拉近一点，你坐得太远了，坐在这把舒舒服服的椅子上，不换姿势就看不到你，可我实在不想动。”

我按照他的吩咐做了，尽管我宁愿仍旧待在多少有点阴影的地方。但罗切斯特先生却是那么直截了当地下命令，似乎立即服从他是理所当然的。

我刚才已经说过，我们是在餐厅里。为用晚餐而点上的枝形吊灯把整个房间照得如节日般灯火辉煌，熊熊的炉火通红透亮，高大的窗子和更高大的拱门前悬挂着华贵宽大的紫色帷幔。除了阿德拉压低嗓门的说话声（她不敢大声说话），以及在谈话停顿间隙传来的冬雨敲打窗户的声音，一切都寂静无声。

罗切斯特先生坐在他那把锦缎面的椅子上，看上去与我以前看到的他不同，没那么严厉，更没那样忧郁。他嘴角带着一丝微笑，眼睛闪闪发光，是不是因为喝了酒的缘故，我不敢肯定，不过很可能如此。总之，他正在饭后的兴头上，更加健谈，更加亲切，和早上的冷淡刻板比起来，也显得更加随便。不过他看上去依然十分严厉。大脑袋靠在椅子隆起的靠背上，炉火的光照在他犹如花岗岩镌刻出来的脸庞上，照进他又大又黑的眸子里——因为他有着一双乌黑的大眼睛，而且很漂亮，有时在眼睛深处也并非没有一点变化，那即使不是柔情，至少也会让你想起这种感情。

他盯着炉火看了已经有两分钟了，而我在用同样的时间打量着他。这时，他突然转过头来，发现我正盯着他看。

“你在观察我，爱小姐，”他说，“你认为我漂亮吗？”

如果我经过仔细考虑的话，我本应当对这个问题做出一个习惯上含糊、礼貌的回答，但不知怎的，我还没意识到就已经脱口而出：“不，先生。”

“啊！我敢打赌，你这人有点儿特别，”他说，“你的神态像个小修女[6]，怪僻、文静、严肃、单纯。你坐着的时候把手放在面前，眼睛总是低垂着看地毯——顺便说一句，除了目光尖利地盯着我的脸的时候，就像刚才那样——别人问你一个问题，或者是发表一些你必须回答的看法时，你会突然直言不讳地回答，如果这不是无礼，至少也是唐突。你的话是什么意思？”

“先生，我刚才的话太直率了，请您原谅。我本应该回答说，关于外貌这样的问题，要当场回答是不容易的；应当说人的审美观各不相同；应当说漂亮并不重要，或者是诸如此类的话。”

“你本来就不应当这样回答。漂亮并不重要，确实如此！原来你是假装要缓和一下刚才的无礼态度，想安慰我，让我平静下来，而实际上这等于在我耳朵下面又狡猾地捅了一刀。继续说下去，请问你发现我有什么缺点？我想我的五官四肢和别人没有什么两样吧。”

“罗切斯特先生，请允许我收回我的第一个回答。我并不是要故意出口伤人，只不过是一时失言而已。”

“是的，我想是这样的。不过你要对此负责。批评我吧，我的额头让你讨厌吗？”

他撩起了平铺在额前的黑色鬈发，露出一个硕大而坚实的有智慧的额头，但是那里显然缺乏那种本该有的仁慈宽厚的迹象。

“好吧，小姐，我是个傻瓜吗？”

“绝对不是这样，先生。如果我反过来问您是不是一个慈善家，您会认为我粗暴无礼吗？”

“又来了！假装是在拍我的头，却又捅了我一刀。那是因为我曾说我不喜欢同孩子和老妇人待在一起。（得小声点儿！）不，年轻小姐，我不是一个一般意义上的慈善家，但是我还有良心。”于是他指了指据说是表示良心的突出的地方。幸亏对他来说，那地方很显眼，使他脑袋的上半部有着引人注目的宽度。“此外，我曾有过一种原始的柔情。在我和你一样年纪的时候，我是一个富有同情心的人，偏爱羽翼未丰、无人养育和运气不佳的人，但是以后命运却一直打击我，它甚至用它的指关节揉面似的揉我，现在我庆幸自己像一个印度皮球一样坚韧了，不过通过一两处空隙还能渗透到里面。在那块地方的中心，还有点感情。是的，那会给我留下一点希望吗？”

“希望什么，先生？”

“希望我最终从橡胶重新变回血肉之躯吗？”

“他肯定是喝得太多了。”我想。我不知道该如何来回答这个奇怪的问题。我怎么知道他是不是可能被转变过来呢？

“看来你感到困惑不解，爱小姐，而你虽然并不漂亮，就像我并不英俊一样，但那种迷惑的神情倒是很适合你。再说，这样也好，可以把你那种搜寻的目光从我的脸上转移到别处去，忙着去看毛毯上的花朵。那你就继续困惑下去吧。年轻的小姐，今天晚上我有点爱凑热闹，也很健谈。”

说完这些，他便从椅子上起来，把胳膊倚在大理石壁炉架上站着。这种姿势让人把他看得一清二楚，就如同看他的体形和面容。他的胸部出奇的宽阔，同他四肢的长度不成比例。我敢肯定，大多数人都认为他是个丑陋的男人，但是他的举止中却无意识地流露出那么明显的傲慢，在行为方面又那么从容自如，对自己的外表显得那么毫不在乎，又是那么高傲地依赖其他内在或外来的特质的力量，来弥补自身外貌上缺乏的吸引力。因此，你一瞧着他，就会不由自主地被他的漠然态度所感染，甚至盲目地对他的自信表示信服。

“今天晚上我有点爱热闹，喜欢说话，”他又重复了这句话，“这就是我请你来的原因。只有炉火和吊灯与我做伴是不够的，派洛特也不行，因为它不会说话。阿德拉稍微好一些，但还远远不够。费尔法克斯太太也一样。而你，我相信正符合我的要求，如果你愿意的话。第一天晚上我邀请你下楼到这里来的时候，你就使我迷惑不解。从那时候起，我几乎把你忘了。别的事情，把你从我的脑子里赶走了。不过今天晚上我决定安闲自在一些，忘掉那些纠缠不休的事情，回忆回忆愉快的事。如果能让你开口说话，我会很高兴的——好进一步了解你，所以说话吧。”

我没有说话，只是微笑，是既不显得非常得意也不是很谦恭的那种微笑。

“说吧。”他催促着。

“说什么呢，先生？”

“想说什么就说什么，说话的内容和方式，都由你来决定。”

我还是端坐着，什么也没有说。“如果他指望我为讲话而讲话，为卖弄自己而讲话，那他会发现自己找错了人了。”我想。

“你哑巴了吗，爱小姐？”

我依然沉默不语。他把头朝我微微一低，匆匆地瞥了我一眼，似乎要探究我的眼睛。

“还不肯开口？”他说，“而且生气了。噢，这倒是合情合理。我提要求的方式，荒谬而近乎无礼。爱小姐，请你原谅。实际上，就一次说清楚吧。我不想把你当做下人看待。那就是（他纠正自己），我有比你强的地方，但那只不过是年龄上大二十岁，经历上相差一个世纪的必然结果。这是合理的，就像阿德拉说的那样，我坚持这一点[7]。凭借这种优势，也仅仅是由于这种优势，我想请你和我谈一会儿，转移一下我的想法，我最近老是纠缠在同样的事情上——像一根生锈的钉子那样被腐蚀着。”

他屈尊做了解释，近乎道歉。我对他的屈尊俯就并没有无动于衷，也不想显得如此。

“先生，只要我能够，我是乐意让您开心的，十分乐意。不过我不能随便谈个话题，因为我怎么知道你对什么感兴趣呢？您提问吧，我尽力回答。”

“那么首先一个问题是，你同不同意，由于我刚才所说的理由，我有权在某些时候稍微专横、唐突或者严厉一些呢？我的理由是，按我的年纪，我可以做你的父亲，而且我有着种种阅历，和许多国家的许多人打过交道，漂泊了半个地球。而你和同一类人平静地生活在同一所房子里。”

“您想怎么样就怎么样吧，先生。”

“这不算是回答，或者说是一个很让人生气的回答，回答得含糊其辞——要回答得明确些。”

“先生，我并不认为您有权命令我，仅仅因为您年纪比我大，或者比我阅历丰富——能否有特权取决于您如何使用自己的时间和阅历。”

“哼！答得倒快。但是我不承认，我认为这对我的情况绝不适用，因为对两者的有利条件，我毫无兴趣。更不必说没有充分利用了。那么我们暂且不谈优越性的问题，但你必须偶尔听候我吩咐，不会由于命令的口气而生气或伤心，好吗？”

我微笑了一下，心想：“罗切斯特先生真是特别，他似乎忘了，他每年付我三十英镑就是让我听他吩咐的。”

“笑得很好，”他立即抓住了我转瞬即逝的表情说，“不过还得开口讲话。”

“先生，我在想，很少有主人会费心去问他们雇用的下属，是否因为他们的命令语气而生气或伤心的。”

“雇用的下属！什么，你是我雇用的下属吗？哦，对了，我把薪俸的事儿给忘了？好吧，那么出于雇用观点，你也得让我耍点儿威风吧？”

“不，先生，不是出于那个理由。而是由于您居然忘了我们的这种关系，由于您还关心您的下属是否心情愉快，我从心底同意。”

“你同意我免去许多的繁文缛节和礼俗客套，而不认为这种省略是出于无礼？”

“我同意，先生。我决不会把不拘礼节误认为蛮横无理。我对不拘礼节很欣赏，至于傲慢无礼，却是任何自由人都不愿忍受的，哪怕是为了赚取薪俸。”

“胡说！为了薪俸，大多数自由人可以忍受一切，因此，只谈你自己吧，不要冒险谈什么你一无所知的事物的普遍性吧。不过，尽管你的回答不太确切，我还是在心里和你握手表示感谢。这不只是为了你回答的内容，同样也是为了你回答时的态度。这种坦率诚恳的态度是不常见的。恰恰相反，对于别人的坦白，人们倒是往往用矫揉造作或者冷漠无情，或者愚蠢粗心的误解来报答。三千个初出校门的女学生担任的家庭教师中，像你刚才那么回答我的不到三个。不过我不是要恭维你，因为如果说你和大多数人不一样，是用另一种模子铸造出来的，这也不是你的功劳，而是大自然的造就。再说，我的结论毕竟下得太快了：就我所知，你未必比别人强多少，或许你还有些让人无法容忍的缺点，抵消了你本来就不多的优点呢。”

“可能您也一样。”我心想，这个想法在我头脑中掠过时，我的目光正好与他的目光相遇。他似乎已揣度出我这一瞥的含意，马上做了回答，仿佛那一瞥的含意不仅存在于想象之中，而且已经说出口了。

“对，对，你是对的，”他说，“我自己也有很多缺点，我知道。我向你保证，我不想掩饰，上帝知道，我不必对别人过于苛求。我要反省我过去的生活，我的一系列行为，我的生活方式，这很可能把我对别人的嘲笑和责备拉回到自己身上。我在二十一岁那一年开始走上了——因为像其他有过失的人一样，我总爱把一半的罪责推给厄运和逆境——或者不如说，被推上了歧途，而且从此之后，再也没有回到正道上。要不然我也许会大不相同，也许会和你一样善良——更聪明一些——几乎一样洁白无瑕。我羡慕你平静的心境、清白的良心、没有遭到玷污的记忆，小姑娘，一个没有污点或未受污染的记忆必定是一种无价之宝，是身心愉快的永不枯竭的源泉，是不是？”

“您十八岁时的记忆怎么样，先生？”

“那时很好，无忧无虑，身心健康。没有滚滚污水把它变成臭水潭。十八岁时我同你不相上下——和你完全一样。总的说来，大自然有意让我成为一个好人，爱小姐，较好的一类人中的一个，而你看到了，我现在并非如此，或许你会说你看不出来，至少我自以为从你的眼睛里看到了这层意思——顺便提一句，你要注意那个器官流露出来的感情，我可是很善于察言观色的——那么请相信我的话：我不是一个恶棍。你不要那样猜想——不要把这些恶名加在我身上。但我深信，是环境而非天性让我成了一个平凡而普通的罪人，沉迷于富人和无用的人试图用来点缀生活的种种无聊至极的放荡行为之中。我向你坦白这些，你不觉得奇怪吗？要知道，在你未来的人生道路上，你常常会发现自己不由自主地被别人当做知己，去倾听你的熟人倾吐隐私。人们像我那样凭直觉就能感到，你的长处不在于谈论你自己，而在于倾听别人谈论他们自己；他们也会感到，你听的时候，并没有因为别人行为不端而带着恶意的轻蔑，而是怀着一种发自内心的同情。这种同情虽然没有十分明显地表露出来，却同样能让人感到安慰和鼓励。”

“您怎么知道的？——这一切您是怎么猜到的呢，先生？”

“我知道得清清楚楚，所以，我才能继续把我的思想说出来，几乎就像把我的思想写在日记中一样，你会说，我本应当战胜环境，是这样——确实应该这样。不过你看到了，我没有做到。当命运对我不公时，我没有用理智保持冷静，我变得不顾一切，于是我堕落了。现在任何一个堕落的傻瓜说了卑俗的下流话，都会激起我的厌恶，可是我并不以为我会比他好些，我不得不承认我与他是一丘之貉。我真希望当初自己站稳了脚——上帝知道我是这么希望的。爱小姐，当你受到诱惑要做错事的时候，你要担心悔恨，悔恨是生活的毒药。”

“据说忏悔是治疗的良药，先生。”

“忏悔治不了它，也许改过自新才是良方。我可以改过自新，我还有力量这样做，如果——不过像我这样受阻碍、受拖累、受诅咒的人，想这些还有什么用呢？既然我已被无可挽回地剥夺了幸福，那我就有权利从生活中获得快乐。我一定要找到乐趣得到它，不管代价有多大。”

“这样您会进一步堕落的，先生。”

“可能吧。不过如果我能获得新鲜甜蜜的欢乐，那我为什么不这样呢？也许我得到的会像是蜜蜂在沼泽地上酿成的野蜂蜜一样甜蜜新鲜。”

“蜜蜂会蜇人——而且野蜂蜜吃起来也是苦的，先生。”

“你怎么知道？——你从来没有试过。那么严肃！——你看上去多么一本正经，而你对这种事情一无所知，就像这个浮雕头一样（他从壁炉上取了一个）！你没有资格对我说教，你这位新教士，你还没有跨入生活的大门，对其中的奥秘一无所知。”

“我不过是用您自己的话提醒您，先生。您说错误带来悔恨，您还说悔恨是生活的毒药。”

“现在谁说错误啦？我并不以为，刚才在我脑子里闪过的想法是个错误。我相信这是一种灵感，而不是一种诱惑，它非常亲切，非常令人欣慰——这我清楚。瞧，它又来了。我敢肯定，它不是魔鬼；或者即使是魔鬼，也披着光明天使的外衣。我认为这样一位美丽的宾客要求进入我心里，我应当同意。”

“不要相信它，先生。它不是一个真正的天使。”

“我再问一次，你怎么知道的呢？你凭什么直觉，就装作能区别一个堕落天使和一位来自永恒王座的使者——区别一位向导和一个勾引者？”

“我是根据您的表情来判断的，先生。刚才您说那个想法又出现了的时候，您的表情很苦恼。我觉得我能肯定，如果您听信了它，那一定会给您造成更大的不幸。”

“绝对不会——它带来的是世界上最美好的信息，至于别的，你又不是我良心的监护人，因此，别为此感到不安。来吧，进来吧，美丽的流浪者！”

他仿佛在对着一个除了他自己别人谁也看不见的幻影说话，随后他把伸出了一半的胳膊收起来放在胸前，似乎要把那个看不见的人搂在怀里。

“现在，”他继续说，再次转向了我，“我已经接待了这位流浪者——乔装打扮的神，我完全相信。它已经为我做了好事。我的心原来像一个停尸所，现在要变成一座神龛了。”

“说实话，先生，我一点也听不懂您的话；我没法和您继续交谈下去了，因为它已超出我的理解范围。我只知道一点，您曾说您并不像自己所希望的那样好，您对自己的缺陷感到遗憾——有一件事我能理解，那就是您说的，一个被玷污了的记忆是永久的祸根。在我看来，只要您努力，到时您会发现有可能变成一个您自己认可的人；只要您从今天开始，下决心改正自己的思想和行为，几年以后您就会积累起一个新的、没有污点的记忆库，供您愉快地去回味了。”

“想得有道理，说得也对，爱小姐；现在，我正努力地给地狱铺路呢。”

“先生？”

“我正在用良好的意图铺路，我相信它像燧石一样经久耐用。当然，今后我所交往的人和追求的事物会和以前不同了。”

“比以前更好？”

“是更好——就像纯矿石比污浊的渣滓要好得多一样。你似乎对我表示怀疑，我对自己一点都不怀疑。我明白自己的目的是什么，动机是什么。现在我要通过一项目的和动机都正确的法律，它像玛代人和波斯人的法律[8]那样不可更改。”

“先生，如果它们需要一个新的法规将它们合法化，那它们就不可能是正当的。”

“它们是正当的，爱小姐，尽管完全需要一个新法规；没有先例的复杂状况需要没有先例的法则。”

“这听起来是个危险的格言，先生，因为一眼就可以看出来，它很容易被人滥用。”

“爱说教的圣人！情况就是如此，但我以家神的名义发誓，我决不滥用。”

“您是凡人，难免会出错。”

“我是凡人，你也一样——那又怎么样？”

“凡人难免出错，不应该冒称具有安全地托付给神明和完人的权力。”

“什么权力？”

“对于任何奇怪的、未经准许的行为说：‘算它对吧。’”

“‘算它对吧’——就是这几个字，你已经说出来了。”

“那就说‘但愿它对吧。’”我说着，站起来，觉得已没有必要再继续这番自己感到糊里糊涂的谈话。此外，我也意识到，我无法摸透对方的性格，至少目前是这样；我还有了一种因深信自己无知而产生的没有把握和隐隐约约的不安全感。

“你要去哪儿？”

“送阿德拉去睡觉，已经过了她上床的时间了。”

“你害怕我，因为我说话像斯芬克斯[9]。”

“您的语言真像谜语，先生。不过尽管我迷惑不解，但我根本不怕。”

“你是害怕的——你的自爱心理使你害怕犯错误。”

“从这个意义上说，我的确有些害怕——我不想胡说。”

“你即使是胡说，也会是一副严肃镇静的板着的神态，我还会误以为说得很有道理。你从来不笑吗，爱小姐？你不必费心来回答——我知道你难得一笑，但是你能够开怀大笑的。请相信我，你不是生来就是严肃的，就像我生来不是邪恶的一样。洛伍德的约束至今还在某种程度上束缚着你，控制着你的神态，压抑着你的声音，捆绑着你的手脚，所以你不敢在一个男人，一位兄长——或者父亲、主人，或者随便什么人——面前开怀大笑，害怕说话太随便，害怕动作太活泼。不过总有一天，我想你会学着和我自然相处，就像我感觉对你不拘礼节一样；到那时，你的深情和动作就会比现在更有生气，更富于变化。我经常透过栅栏紧密的鸟笼，观察一只新奇的鸟，看它的眼神，笼子里分明是一个活跃、不安、不屈不挠的囚徒，一旦获得自由，它一定会展翅高飞，直入云霄。你还是一定要走？”

“已经过了九点，先生。”

“没有关系——等一会儿吧，阿德拉还不想上床呢，爱小姐。我坐的位置，背靠着炉火，面对房间，便于观察。和你谈话的时候，我也不时注意着她——我有理由把她当做奇特的研究对象，这理由我可以……不，我改天再讲给你听——大约十分钟之前，她从盒子里取出一件粉红色的丝绸小上衣，打开看的时候脸上充满了喜悦，媚俗之气流动在她的血液里，融入她的脑髓里，渗入她的骨髓里。‘我一定得试一试！[10]’她嚷道，‘马上就试！[11]’于是她冲出了房间。现在她和索菲在一起，正忙着试装呢。用不了几分钟，她会再次进来，我知道我会看到什么——塞莉纳·瓦伦的缩影，当年帷幕开启，她出现在舞台上的模样，不过，别去管她。但是，我最柔弱的感情将为之震动，这就是我的预感。现在别走，看看我的话是否会成为现实。”

没多久，我就听见阿德拉的小脚轻快地穿过客厅，她进来了，正如她的保护人所预言的那样，已经完全变了模样。一套玫瑰色缎子衣服代替了原来的棕色上衣，这件衣服很短，裙摆大得不能再大。她的额上戴着一个玫瑰花蕾编成的花环，脚上穿着丝袜和白缎子小凉鞋。

“我这件衣服合身吗？[12]”她蹦蹦跳跳地跑到前面，大声叫着，“我的鞋呢？袜子呢？看，我要跳舞了！[13]”

她展开裙子，滑着轻快的舞步穿过房间，到了罗切斯特先生面前，踮起脚尖在他面前轻盈地转了一圈，然后一膝着地，蹲在他脚边，嚷着：

“先生，多谢您的好意。[14]”随后她站立起来补充了一句，“妈妈过去也是这样做的，对吗？[15]”

“确——实——像。”他答道，“而且就像那样[16]，她把我迷住了，从我这个英国人的裤袋里骗走了我英国的钱。我也曾稚嫩过，爱小姐——唉，青草一般稚嫩，一度使我生气勃勃的青春一点也不比你现在差。不过，我的春天已经逝去，却把这朵法国小花留在了我的手上。依我有时的心情，我真想摆脱它。现在我不再珍视生它出来的根，而且还发现它需要用金土来培育，于是我对这朵花也就不怎么喜欢了，尤其是当它像刚才那显得矫揉造作的时候。我收留它，养育它，只是按照罗马天主教教义，用做一件好事来赎无数大大小小的罪孽。改天再给你解释这一切。晚安。”

第十五章


在日后的一个场合，罗切斯特先生果然对这件事情做了解释。一天下午，他偶然在庭院里碰到了我和阿德拉。趁阿德拉正逗着派洛特、玩着板羽球的时候，他请我去一条长长的布满山毛榉的小路上散步，从那儿可以看得见阿德拉。

于是，他告诉我阿德拉是法国歌剧演员塞莉纳·瓦伦的女儿，他对这位歌剧演员，一度怀着他所说的“强烈的爱情[1]”。而对于他的这种爱情，塞莉纳声称将以一种更加火热的激情来回报。他以为自己是她崇拜的偶像，尽管他长得丑，但是他相信，像他所说的，和贝尔维德尔的阿波罗[2]的优美比起来，她更喜欢他的“体育家的身材[3]”。

“爱小姐，这位法国美女竟然钟情于一个英国侏儒，这让我简直受宠若惊，于是我把她安顿在一家旅馆里，给她配备了一整套的仆役和马车，送给她开司米羊绒、钻石和花边布等等。总之，我像任何一个痴情汉一样，开始按照那种大家都司空见惯的方式来毁掉自己了。我似乎缺乏独创性去另辟蹊径地走向耻辱和毁灭，而是愚蠢地严格循着旧道，一寸也没有偏离别人的足迹。我遭到了——我这是自作自受——和所有别的痴情汉一样的命运。一天晚上，我偶然地去看她，我到时她不在，她没有想到我会去。那是一个温暖的夜晚，因为我是步行穿过巴黎，走得累了，所以就在她的闺房里坐了下来，愉快地呼吸着新近由于她的存在而变得神圣了的空气。不——我言过其实了，我从来不认为她身上有什么神圣的德性。这只不过是她所留下的一种香水的气味，与其说是圣洁的香气，不如说是一种麝香和琥珀的气味。暖房里鲜花的气息和弥漫着的香水味使我开始透不过气来，我想到要打开落地长窗，到阳台上去。这时月色皎洁，街上的煤气灯也亮着，十分静谧。阳台上摆着一两把椅子，我坐了下来，掏出一支雪茄——现在我也想抽一支，如果你不介意的话。”

说到这里他停顿了一下，拿出一支雪茄点燃了。他把雪茄放到嘴里，把一缕哈瓦那烟雾喷进寒冷而阴沉的空气里，又继续说道：

“那时候，我还喜欢糖果，爱小姐。而当时我一会儿大嚼[4]——别介意我的粗野——巧克力糖果，一会儿抽雪茄，同时还望着沿着繁华街道向邻近的歌剧院驶去的一辆辆马车。这时，在灯火辉煌的城市夜景中驶来了一辆精致的轿式马车，由一对漂亮的英国马拉着，我看得清清楚楚，那正是我送给塞莉纳的‘马车[5]’。她回来了。当然，我的心迫不及待地撞击着我倚靠的铁栏杆。不出我所料，马车在旅馆门口停了下来。我的心肝——这个词用来称呼一个唱歌剧的情人非常合适——从车上走下来，尽管罩着斗篷——顺便说一句，在那么暖和的六月的夜晚，那完全是不必要的累赘——但是，当她从马车踏脚上跳下来时，我从那双从衣裙下面露出的小脚，立刻就认出了她。我从阳台上探出身子，正要轻声呼唤一声‘我的天使[6]’——当然用的是只有情人才能听得见的音调——这时，一个身影跟在她后面也跳下了马车，同样也披着斗篷。但是在人行道上发出声响的却是带马刺的脚跟，接着从供车辆出入的旅馆拱形大门4[7]下面经过的是一个戴礼帽的脑袋。

“你从来没有忌妒过，是不是，爱小姐？当然没有，这我不必问你，因为你从来没有恋爱过。这两种感情还有待于你去体验。你的灵魂还在沉睡，还有待于一次震荡才能把它唤醒，你认为一切生活都像平静的流水般逝去，就像到现在为止你的青春一直在平静地流走一样。你闭着眼睛，蒙住了耳朵，随波逐流，既没有看到不远的河床上礁石林立，也没有听到浪涛在礁石脚下滚滚翻腾，但是我告诉你——你仔细听着——某一天你会来到河道中岩石嶙峋的关隘，这里，你整个生命的河流会被撞得粉碎，成了旋涡和骚动、泡沫和喧嚣，你不是在岩石尖角上被冲得粉身碎骨，就是被某个席卷一切的巨浪掀起来带走，汇入较为平静的河流中去——就像我现在一样。

“我喜欢今天这样的日子，喜欢这铁灰色的天空，喜欢严寒笼罩下的庄严与寂静，喜欢桑菲尔德，喜欢它的古老、它的幽静，喜欢它乌鸦栖息的老树和荆棘，它灰色的正面外观，它映出灰色苍穹的一排排暗黑的窗户。可是有很长时间，我连想想它都觉得厌恶，像躲避瘟疫病房一样对它避之不及，就连现在我依然多么厌恶——”

他咬住牙，然后沉默了下来。他停下了脚步，用靴子踢着坚硬的地面，仿佛有某种仇恨的思想紧紧地抓住了他，使他无法向前。

他这样停下来的时候，我们正沿着小路往前走；桑菲尔德府出现在我们面前。他抬起头望望防卫墙，怒目而视。这种眼神，我以前和以后都没有见过。痛苦、羞耻、愤怒、烦躁、厌恶、憎恨——一时似乎在他浓黑的眉毛下胀大的瞳孔里，进行着一场令人战栗的斗争。这场激烈的斗争非常地疯狂，不过另一种感情在他心中升起，胜利了，那是一种冷酷而愤世嫉俗的、任性而坚决的感情，这种感情平息了他的激情，他的脸上出现了一种木然的神色，他继续说道：

“刚才在我沉默的时候，爱小姐，我正跟自己的命运商榷着一件事情，她站在那儿，在那株山毛榉树干的旁边——一个女巫，就像在福累斯荒原上出现在麦克白面前的几个女巫中的一个[8]。‘你喜欢桑菲尔德吗？’她竖起手指问道，随后在空中写了一条警语，那文字奇形怪状，十分可怖，横贯整个屋子的正面，在上下两排的窗户之间：‘如果你能，你就喜欢它！如果你敢，你就喜欢它！’

“‘我要喜欢它，’我说，‘我敢喜欢它。’（他郁郁寡欢地补充了一句）我会信守诺言，排除艰难险阻去追求幸福，追求善良——对，善良。我希望做个比以前、比现在更好的人——就像约伯的海中怪兽[9]那样，折断矛戟和标枪，刺破盔甲，扫除一切障碍，别人以为这些障碍坚如钢铁，而我却视之为干草、朽木。”

这时阿德拉拿着板羽球跑到了他面前。“走开！”他厉声喝道，“离得远一点，孩子，要不，到里面索菲那儿去！”随后他继续默默地散步，我大胆地提醒他刚才突然岔开的话题。

“瓦伦小姐进屋的时候，先生，”我问道，“您离开阳台了吗？”

我本预料他会拒绝回答这个不合时宜的问题，可是恰恰相反，他从一脸愁容、茫然若失之中醒了过来，把目光转向我，眉宇间的阴云也似乎消散了。

“哦，我都把塞莉纳给忘了！好吧，我接着讲。当我看见那个把我迷得神魂颠倒的女人，由一个好献殷勤的男人陪着走进来时，我似乎听到了嘶的一声，绿色的妒忌之蛇，从月光照耀下的阳台上呼地蹿了上来，抖开了盘踞的身体，钻进了我的背心，两分钟后一直咬到了我的心里。真奇怪！”他突然又偏离了话题，惊叫一声：“真奇怪我竟会选你来听我的这番知心话，年轻的女士，更奇怪的是你居然静静地听着，仿佛这是世界上最正常不过的事情，一个像我这样的男人，把自己和歌剧演员情人之间的故事，讲给一个像你这样古怪而不谙世事的姑娘听。不过正像我曾说过的那样，后一件怪事正好解释了前面的一件，正如我以前有一次和你说过的：你严肃、体贴、细心，生来就是听别人吐露隐秘的。此外，我知道我选择的是哪一类心灵来与自己的心灵沟通。我知道这是一个不易受到感染的心灵，一个与众不同的心灵，一个独一无二的心灵。幸好我并不想伤害它，不过，即使是我想这么做的话，它也不会受影响的，你和我谈得越多越好，因为我不可能伤害你，而你却可以使我重新振作起来。”说完这些离题的话以后，他又继续说：

“我仍然待在阳台上。‘他们肯定会到她的闺房里来，’我想，‘让我来准备一场伏击。’于是我把手伸进开着的窗子将窗帘拉拢，只剩下一条便于观察的空隙。然后把窗子关上，只留下一条狭窄的缝，刚好听见‘情人们的喃喃耳语和山盟海誓’，接着我偷偷地回到了椅子上。刚坐好，那一对进来了。我马上把眼睛凑近缝隙。塞莉纳的侍女走进房间，点上灯，放在桌子上，退了出去。于是这一对便清清楚楚地暴露在我的面前了。两人都脱去了斗篷，这位‘名人瓦伦’满身绸缎，珠光宝气——当然是我的馈赠——她的伴儿穿了一身军官制服，我知道他是一个有子爵[10]头衔的年轻的花花公子[11]——一个没有头脑的恶少，在社交场合见过几次面，不过，我从来没想到去憎恨他，因为我根本就瞧不起他。一认出是他，忌妒之蛇的毒牙立即断了，因为与此同时，我对塞莉纳的爱火也被浇灭了。一个为了这样一个情敌而背弃我的女人，是不值得一争的，她只配让我蔑视，然而我更该如此，因为我竟然受了她的愚弄。

“他们开始谈话。两个人的谈话使我完全安心了，轻浮浅薄、唯利是图、冷酷无情、毫无意义，叫人听了只会厌烦，而不是愤怒。桌上放着一张我的名片，他们一看见便议论起我来了。两个人谁也没有能力和智慧来狠狠痛斥我，而是尽他们所能，以可鄙的方式，粗俗地侮辱我，尤其是塞莉纳，甚至夸大其词地对我进行人身攻击，把我的缺陷说成残疾，而以前她却惯于热情赞美我的所谓“男性美[12]”。在这一点上，你与她截然不同，在我们第二次见面时，你就直截了当地告诉我，你认为我长得不帅，那时两者的对比给我留下了深刻印象，而且……”

这时阿德拉又跑到他的面前。

“先生，约翰刚才说，您的代理人来了，要见您。”

“噢！那样我就只好长话短说了。我打开落地窗，朝他们走过去，解除了我对塞莉纳的保护关系，通知她离开旅馆，给了她一笔钱供她急用，没有理睬她的尖叫、歇斯底里、哀求、抗议和抽搐，跟那位子爵约定在布洛尼树林[13]决斗的时间。第二天早晨，我有幸与他进行了决斗，在他一条瘦弱得如同瘟鸡翅膀般可怜的胳膊上，留下了一颗子弹，随后就自以为我已了结同这伙人的关系。但是不幸的是，在六个月以前，这位瓦伦给我留下了这个小姑娘[14]阿德拉，并咬定她是我的女儿。也许她是，尽管我从她的脸上看不出有什么这种不容置疑的父女关系的证据，派洛特都比她更像我呢。我同她母亲决裂后几年，她遗弃了孩子，跟一个音乐家或者是歌唱家私奔到了意大利。当时我并没有承认自己有抚养阿德拉的义务，就是现在也不承认，因为我并不是她的父亲，不过听说她孤苦无依，我便把这个可怜虫带出了巴黎的烂泥塘，带到了这里，让她在英国乡间花园健康的土壤中，干干净净地成长。费尔法克斯太太找到了你来培养她，而现在，你知道她是一位法国歌剧女郎的私生女，也许会对自己的职位和你的学生的身份有了新的看法，也许哪一天你会来见我，通知我你已经找到了别的工作，让我另请一位新的家庭教师等等呢——呃？”

“不，阿德拉不应该对她母亲和您的过失负责。我很关心她，现在我知道她在某种意义上说是没有父母——被她的母亲所抛弃，又不被您承认，先生——我会比以前更加疼爱她。我怎么可能宁愿去教一个富贵人家娇生惯养、讨厌家庭教师的孩子，而离开像朋友一样对待自己、依赖自己、孤苦无依的孤儿呢？”

“啊，你是从这个角度来看待这件事的，好吧，我得进去了，你也一样，天已经黑了。”

不过我与阿德拉和派洛特在外面又待了几分钟——和她赛了一次跑，又打了一盘板羽球。我们进屋以后，我脱下了她的帽子和外衣，把她放在自己的膝上，让她整整坐了一个小时。在这期间，听凭她尽情地唠叨个不停，即使有点放肆和轻浮，也不加指责。在别人特别注意她的时候，她就会犯这个毛病，暴露出她性格上的浅薄。这种浅薄在英国人看来十分不相宜，很可能是来自她母亲的遗传。不过她也有她的优点，我特意地尽量欣赏她身上的一切优点。我在她的脸上竭力寻找着与罗切斯特先生的相似之处，但是却一点也没有找到。没有一点特征，没有一丝表情能够表明他们之间的血缘关系。真可惜，如果能证实她像他，他肯定会更关心她的。

直到回到自己房间休息的时候，我才仔细地回味罗切斯特先生告诉我的故事。正像他所说的，故事的内容本身也许没有什么特别的地方，无非是一个有钱的英国男人热恋一个法国舞女，而她背叛了他。毫无疑问，这是上流社会中司空见惯的事情。不过在他谈起自己目前的满足和对老宅及其周围的环境重新感到的乐趣时，突然情绪激动起来，这真是有些奇怪。我带着疑问思考这件事，但是慢慢地也就放弃了，因为我发现这是我目前所无法解释的。我又回过头考虑起主人对我的态度来，他认为可以对我推心置腹，这似乎是对我处事审慎的赞美；我是这样看待的，也是这样接受它的。几周来他在我面前的举动已不像当初那样变化无常。他似乎从不认为我碍手碍脚，也没有动不动摆出一副冷冰冰的傲慢态度[15]来。有时他和我意外地相遇，对于这样的碰面，他似乎也很欢迎，总是说上一两句话，有时还对我笑笑。在正式邀请我去见他时，我很荣幸地受到了热情的接待，这使我觉得自己确实能给他带来乐趣，觉得他这样的晚上找我既是为了我，也是为了让他自己感到愉快。

其实，相比之下我的话并不多，不过我津津有味地听他说。他天生健谈，喜欢向一个未见世面的人披露一点世事人情（我不是指腐败的风尚和恶劣的习气，而是指那些因为广泛流行、新奇独特而显得有趣的世事），我非常乐意接受他所提供的新观念，想象出他所描绘的新画面，在脑海中跟随着他越过他展示出来的新领域，从来没有由于他提到的某些有害的暗示而吃惊或者烦恼。

他举手投足无拘无束，使我不再感到让人难受的窘迫。他对我友好坦诚，既得体又热情，让我更加接近他。我感觉有时候他更像是我的一个亲戚，而不是我的主人。虽然他有时仍然盛气凌人，但是我并不在意，因为我知道，他就是这副模样。生活中平添了这种新的乐趣，我变得又愉快又满意，不再去渴望有自己的亲人了，我那纤如新月的命运也似乎壮大了，生活中的空白被填补了，我的健康有所好转，人长胖了，也有了力量。

在我看来，罗切斯特先生现在还很丑吗？不，读者。感激之情还有许多愉快而亲切的联想使我现在最爱看的就是他的脸。房间里只要有他在，比生了最旺的炉火还让人高兴。不过我并没有忘记他的缺点。说实话，要忘也忘不了，因为他常常让缺点暴露在我面前。对于不管是哪方面低于他的人，他都高傲刻薄，喜欢挖苦，态度粗暴。在我的内心深处，我明白他对我的宽厚和蔼的程度和对其他人不公正的严厉的程度是相等的。他郁郁寡欢，简直到了难以理解的程度。我被叫去读书给他听时，曾不止一次发现他独自一人坐在图书室里，把头埋在交叠的双臂中。他抬起头时，一副阴郁的、近乎恶意的怒容，使他的脸变得阴暗。不过我相信他的忧郁、他的严厉和他道德上以前的过错（我说以前，因为现在他似乎已经改正了）都来源于他命运中某些无情的磨难。我相信，比起那些纯粹由环境造就、教育所培养或者是命运所鼓励的人来说，他为人天生就有着更好的志向，更高的原则，更纯洁的趣味。我想他身上有着优秀的素质，只是目前给糟蹋了，乱纷纷地混杂在一起。我无法否认，我为他的悲伤而悲伤，不管那悲伤是什么，并且愿意付出很大的代价去减轻它。

虽然我现在已经吹灭了蜡烛，躺在床上，但一想起他在林荫道上停下来时的神色，我便无法入睡。那时他说命运之神怎样出现在他面前，问他敢不敢在桑菲尔德获得幸福。

“为什么不敢呢？”我问自己，“是什么使他与这所房子疏远了呢？他会马上再次离开这儿吗？费尔法克斯太太说，他连续待在这儿的时间很少超过两周。而这次已经住了八周了。如果他真的走了，带来的变化真令人悲哀。想想如果他春天、夏天、秋天都不在这儿，那阳光和晴朗的天气将多么无趣！”

这样想了一会儿以后，我也不知道自己是否睡着过。总之，在我听到一阵含糊的喃喃声之后，便完全清醒过来。那声音古怪而悲哀，就是从我头上传来的。我真希望蜡烛还继续点着，夜黑得可怕，我感到心情压抑。于是我坐了起来，在床上，静静地听着。那声音又消失了。

我努力想再睡着，可是心却惶恐不安地怦怦直跳。我内心的平静被打破了，远在楼底下的大厅里，时钟敲响了两点。就在这时，我的房门似乎被碰了一下，仿佛有人摸黑走过外面的走廊时，手指从门上摸过一样。我问：“谁在那里？”没有回答。我吓得浑身发凉。

我蓦地想起这可能是派洛特，厨房门偶尔开着的时候，它常常会设法来到罗切斯特先生卧室的门口，有几个早晨我就亲眼看见它躺在那里。这么一想，心里便稍微镇静了一些。我躺了下来。寂静安抚了我的神经。待到整所房子又被一片宁静所笼罩时，我感到睡意再次来临。但是那天晚上我是注定无法睡着了。梦神几乎刚刚接近我的耳朵就被吓得仓皇而逃了——发生了一件把人吓得冷彻骨髓的事情。

那是一阵恶魔般的笑声——压抑而低沉——仿佛就在我房门的锁孔外。我的床头离门很近，起初我还以为那发出笑声的魔鬼就站在我的床边，或者是蹲在枕旁。但是我起身环顾四周，却什么也没有看到。而当我还在凝神细看时，那个奇怪的声音再次响起，我知道它是从门后面传来的。我的第一个反应是起身去把门闩好，接着我又大声喊道：“谁在那里？”

有个什么东西发出咯咯声，还有呻吟声。不久，有脚步声又退回走廊，上了三楼的楼梯。最近那里装了一扇门，关闭了楼梯。我听见门被打开又被关上，一切又恢复平静。

“那是格雷斯·普尔吗，是她妖魔附身了吗？”我想。我独自一人再也待不下去了。我必须得去找费尔法克斯太太。我匆匆地穿上外衣，披上披肩，用颤抖着的手拉开门闩，开了门。就在门外面，在走廊的垫子上，有一支点燃的蜡烛。看到此情景，我心里一惊，但更使我惊慌的是，我发觉空气十分混浊，仿佛弥漫着烟雾，正当我左顾右盼，寻找青色烟雾的来源时，我进一步闻到了一股浓烈的燃烧的气味。

什么东西嘎吱响了一声。是一扇半掩的门，是罗切斯特先生的房门，一团团的烟雾正从里面冒出来。我不再去想费尔法克斯太太，也不再去想格雷斯·普尔，或者那笑声。一瞬间，我就冲进了他的房间。火舌从床和四周蹿出，帐幔已经起火。在火光与烟雾的包围中，罗切斯特先生一动不动地伸直了身子躺着，正在沉沉酣睡。

“快醒醒！快醒醒！”我一面推他，一面大叫，他却只是嘟哝了一声，翻了一个身，他已被烟雾熏得麻木了，连床单也已经起火，一分钟也不能耽搁了。我冲向他的脸盆和水罐，幸好脸盆很大，水罐很深，而且里面灌满了水。我举起脸盆和水罐，用水向着床和睡在床上的人泼过去，接着我又飞快地跑回自己的房间，取了我的水罐，再次向床上泼过去。上帝保佑，我终于把正要吞噬床榻的火焰扑灭了。

被浇灭的火焰发出的嘶嘶声，我倒完水随手扔掉的水罐的破裂声，尤其是我毫不吝啬地泼洒如沐浴般的水的哗啦声，终于把罗切斯特先生吵醒了。尽管此刻漆黑一片，但我知道他醒了，因为我听到他一发现自己躺在一片汪洋之中，便怒气冲冲地发出了奇怪的咒骂声。

“发洪水了吗？”他大声叫道。

“没有，先生，”我回答道，“只不过是发生了一场火灾。起来吧，一定得起来，现在您浑身都湿透了，我去给您拿支蜡烛来。”

“看在基督世界所有精灵的分上，那是简·爱吗？”他问道，“你都对我做了些什么，你这个女巫，妖婆，除了你，房间里还有谁，你要密谋把我淹死吗？”

“我去给您拿支蜡烛，先生，看在老天的分上，快起来吧。是有个什么人密谋要做件什么事。您不可能马上弄清楚是谁密谋了什么事。”

“瞧——现在我起来了。不过你还得冒险去取一支蜡烛来，不过等我两分钟，让我穿上一件干外衣，如果还有什么干衣服的话——好了，这是我的衬衣，好了，跑吧！”

我真的跑了，把仍然留在走廊上的蜡烛拿了回来。他从我手里拿走蜡烛，举得高高的，仔细地察看着床铺，只见一片焦黑，床单湿透了，周围的地毯也浸泡在水中。

“这是怎么回事？是谁干的？”他问道。

我简要地向他叙述了一下事情的经过。我听到的走廊上奇怪的笑声，走上三楼的脚步声，还有那烟雾——把我引到他房间的火焦味，我在那儿看到的场面，还有我又怎样把我所能找到的水都倒在他的身上。

他表情严肃地听着。随着我继续往下说，他脸上的表情，忧虑超过了惊讶。我讲完以后他并没有马上开口。

“要我去叫费尔法克斯太太吗？”我问。

“费尔法克斯太太？不要了，真是见鬼，你叫她干什么？她能干什么呢？让她安安稳稳地睡她的觉吧。”

“那么我去叫莉娅，把约翰夫妇唤醒。”

“根本不用，安安静静就行了。你披上披肩了吗？如果觉得还不够暖和，把那边的斗篷拿去。把自己裹起来，坐在安乐椅里，那儿——我替你披上。现在把脚放在小凳子上，免得弄湿了。我要离开你几分钟，我得把蜡烛拿走，你待在这儿别动，直到我回来。你要像耗子一样安静，我得到三楼去看看。记住别动，也别去叫人。”

他走了，我注视着灯光越来越远。他蹑手蹑脚地走上楼梯，开了楼梯的门，尽可能不发出一点声音来，随手把门关上，于是最后一点光也消失了。我被留在了一片黑暗之中。我侧耳听着有什么声音，但是什么也没听到。过了很长一段时间，我不耐烦起来，尽管披着斗篷，但依然感觉很冷。而且既然我又不打算把屋子里的人叫醒，我继续待下去也没什么必要了。我正要不顾会引起罗切斯特先生的不快，违背他的命令时，灯光又隐约映亮了走廊的墙壁，我听到他光脚走过地席的声音。“希望是他，”我心想，“而不是什么更坏的东西。”

他回到屋里时脸色苍白，神情忧郁。“我全都搞清楚了，”他把蜡烛放在洗衣架上，说，“和我想的一样。”

“怎么回事，先生？”

他没有回答，只是抱起双臂站在那儿，眼睛望着地板。几分钟后，他带着奇怪的声调问道：

“我忘了你是不是说过你打开房门的时候看到了什么东西。”

“没有，先生，只看见地板上的蜡烛。”

“可是你听到了古怪的笑声？我想你以前听到过那笑声，或者类似的声音。”

“是的，先生，这儿有一个做针线活儿的女人，她叫格雷斯·普尔——她的笑声就这样，她是个怪人。”

“就是这么回事，格雷斯·普尔，你猜对了。正像你说的那样，她是一个古怪人，很古怪。好吧，我要考虑一下这件事情。同时我很高兴，你是除我之外唯一一个知道今晚这件事情确切细节的人。你不是一个爱多嘴的傻瓜，关于这件事，你什么也不要说。这儿这种情景（他指着床），由我来解释。现在回到你自己的房间，剩下的时间我完全可以在书房的沙发上对付过去。现在已经快四点了，再过两个小时用人们就要起床了。”

“那么，晚安，先生。”说着我就要走。

他似乎很吃惊——这很自相矛盾，因为他刚才还说让我走。

“什么！”他大声叫道，“你就要走了，就这么走了？”

“您说我可以走了，先生。”

“可总不能不道个别，不说上一两句道谢和友善的话吧，总之不能那样简单、冷淡地走吧。哎，你救了我的命！把我从可怕的、痛苦的死亡中拯救了出来！而你就这么从我面前走过，仿佛我们素不相识！至少也得握握手吧。”

他伸出手来，我也向他伸出手去。他先是用一只手握着，随后用双手把我的手握住。

“你救了我的命。我很高兴，欠了你那么大一笔人情债。我无法再说别的话了，如果换成别的人，我欠了那么大的情，我肯定会难以忍受，可是你却不同。你一点也没有让我觉得欠你的恩情是一种负担，简。”

他停了下来，凝视着我，看得出话语几乎已经到了他颤抖的嘴边，可是声音却被哽住了。

“再次祝您晚安，先生，这件事情谈不上欠债、恩情、负担或者是恩惠。”

“我早就知道，”他继续说道，“你会在某一时候，以某种方式来帮助我——我初次见你的时候，就从你眼睛里看到了这一点，它们的表情和微笑并不是（他再次停了下来），并不是（他急急忙忙地继续说道）无缘无故地让我在心底感到欢乐。人们爱谈天生的同情心，我曾听说过善良的神怪，在最荒诞的寓言里也包含有几分真理。我珍爱的救命恩人，晚安。”

在他的嗓音里有一种奇怪的活力，在他的眼神中有一种奇怪的激情。

“我很高兴，我碰巧醒着。”我说，接着我就准备走了。

“什么，你要走了？”

“我觉得冷，先生。”

“冷？对——而且还站在一摊水中！那么走吧，简，走吧！”不过他仍然握着我的手，我没法抽回来，于是我想了一个办法。

“我好像听到了费尔法克斯太太走动的声音了，先生。”我说。

“好吧，你走吧。”他放开手，我走了。

我又回到了我的床上，却毫无睡意。我一直在欢乐却不安的海面上辗转颠簸，烦恼的波涛在喜悦的巨浪下翻滚，如此一直到了天明。有时候我想，越过汹涌澎湃的水面，我看到了像比乌拉山[16]那么甜蜜的海岸，不时有一阵被希望所唤起的愈来愈强劲的清风，将我的灵魂胜利地载向目的地，即使在幻想之中，我也难以抵达那里——从陆地上吹来了一阵逆风，不断地把我赶回去，理智会抵制幻想，判断能告诫热情，我兴奋得无法入睡，所以天一亮就起床了。

第十六章


在那个不眠之夜后的第二天，我既希望见到罗切斯特先生，又害怕见到他。我很想再一次听到他的声音，可是又害怕与他的目光相遇。上午的前半晌我时刻盼望着他的到来。他不经常走进教室，但有时却进来待上几分钟。我有这样的预感，那天他一定会来。

但是，早上和往常一样过去了。没有发生什么使阿德拉安静的学习受到干扰。只是早餐过后不久，我听到罗切斯特先生房间附近一阵喧闹，有费尔法克斯太太的声音，还有莉娅的和厨娘的——也就是约翰妻子的声音，甚至还有约翰本人粗重的声调，乱纷纷的一片惊呼：“主人没有给烧死在床上，真是幸运啊！”“点蜡烛过夜总归是很危险的。”“真是上帝保佑，他还能那么清醒，想起了水罐！”“真奇怪，他谁都没有吵醒！”“但愿他睡在图书室沙发上不会着凉！”

七嘴八舌地议论一番之后，就响起了擦擦洗洗、收拾整理的声音。我下楼吃饭经过那间房子的时候，从开着的门望进去，只见一切都重新收拾得井井有条，只是床上的帐幔给拿掉了。莉娅正站在窗台上，擦着被烟熏黑了的玻璃。我正想和她说话，想知道这件事是怎么解释的。但是往前走过去一看，房间里还有另外一个人——一个女人正坐在床边的椅子上，给新窗帘上钉挂环。这个女人正是格雷斯·普尔。

她坐在那里，像往常一样一副沉默寡言的样子，穿着褐色毛料衣服，围着格子围裙，系着白手帕，戴着帽子。她专心致志地忙着手头的活儿，似乎全部注意力都集中在了这上面。她冷漠的额头和普普通通的五官，既不显得苍白，也不见绝望的表情——那种人们期望在一个蓄谋杀人的女人脸上看到的表情特征，而且她图谋杀害的人昨天夜里还跟踪到了她的藏身之处，而且（我相信）已经指控了她谋杀未遂的罪行。我大惑不解——简直给弄糊涂了。我继续盯着她看时，她抬起了头，脸上没有惊慌，也没有变色，不曾露出一丝激动或者负罪感，或者害怕被发现的恐惧。只是以她惯常的冷淡和简短的方式说了声：“早上好，小姐。”然后拿起另外一个挂环和一圈线带，继续缝了起来。

“让我来试试她，”我想，“那样高深莫测真让人难以理解。”

“早上好，格雷斯。”我说，“这儿发生了什么事吗？我好像听到刚才仆人们都在议论呢。”

“没有什么，只是主人昨天夜里在床上看书，点着蜡烛就睡着了，结果床幔起了火，幸亏在床单和床架木板着火之前他就醒了，想办法用水罐里的水把火浇灭了。”

“真是怪事！”我低声说道，然后目不转睛地盯着她，“罗切斯特先生没有叫醒别人吗？没有人听到他走动的声音吗？”

她再次抬起眼睛看着我，这一次她的眼睛里流露出了一种有所察觉的神情。她似乎先是警惕地打量了我一会儿，然后才回答道：

“仆人们睡的地方离得很远，你知道的，小姐，他们是不大可能听到的。费尔法克斯太太的房间和你的房间离主人的卧室最近，可是费尔法克斯太太说她什么也没有听到，人上了年纪，总是睡得很死。”她顿了一下，随后装作若无其事的样子，却以清楚而意味深长的语调补充说：“不过你很年轻，小姐，我想你不会睡得那么沉吧，或许你听到了什么声音。”

“我是听到了。”为了不让正在擦窗的莉娅听到，我压低了声音说，“一开始我还以为是派洛特，可是派洛特不会笑，而我敢肯定，我是听到了笑声，古怪的笑声。”

她又拿了一根线，仔细地上了蜡，手沉稳地把线穿过了针眼，然后十分镇静地说：

“我想，小姐，在那样危险的情况之下，主人是不大可能笑的，小姐，你一定是在做梦了。”

“我没有做梦。”我有点恼火地说，因为她这种厚颜无耻的镇定把我激怒了。她又看着我，还是用那种探究和警惕的眼神。

“你告诉主人你听到笑声了吗？”她问道。

“今天早上我还没有机会和他说话呢。”

“你没有想到把门打开，往走廊里看一看？”她继续问道。

她似乎是在盘问我，想让我在不知不觉中把话说出来。我忽然想到，如果她发现我知道或者是怀疑她有罪，就会恶意捉弄我，我想还是小心提防她为妙。

“恰恰相反，”我说，“我把门闩上了。”

“这么说你每天睡觉之前没有闩门的习惯吗？”

“魔鬼！她想知道我的习惯，以便根据它来定出计划！”愤怒再次压倒谨慎，我尖刻地回答：“在这以前，我常常忘了把门闩上，我认为这没有必要，我以前没有想到在桑菲尔德府还要担心什么危险或者烦恼；但是，从今以后（我特别强调了这几个字），我一定要确保一切都安全之后再睡下。”

“这样做是明智的。”她回答，“虽然这附近一带比我知道的任何地方都安静，从府宅建好以来，我还没有听说过有强盗上门呢；但是大家都知道，餐具柜里有的餐具就值几百英镑；而且你看，这么大的一座府宅，却只有很少的几个用人，因为主人不常在这儿住，他即使回来住，也不过是个单身汉，用不了几个人伺候。不过我一直都觉得过分地注意安全总比不注意安全好，把门闩上费不了多少事，闩上门把自己和外面可能发生的任何的灾祸分开为好。小姐，很多人都把一切托付给上帝，但是我觉得，上帝不会排斥采取措施，尽管他总是常常祝福那些谨慎采取的措施。”说到这里她才结束了她的长篇演说。这番话对于她来说是够长的了，而且口气里带着贵格会女教徒的一本正经。

我还站在那里，被她那种不可思议的镇定和深不可测的伪善惊呆了。这时候，厨娘走了进来。

“普尔太太，”她对格雷斯说，“用人的午饭马上就准备好了，你下楼去吗？”

“不用啦，只要把我那一品脱葡萄酒再加上一小块布丁放在托盘里就行了，我会自己端到楼上去。”

“你还要些肉吗？”

“就要一小点儿吧，再来一点奶酪，就这些。”

“还要西米[1]吗？”

“现在不要，吃茶点之前我会下来的，我自己来做。”

这时厨娘转向我说，费尔法克斯太太在等我，于是我就离开了。

吃午饭的时候，费尔法克斯太太谈起帐幔失火的事，我也无心去听。因为我绞尽脑汁苦苦思索着格雷斯·普尔这个神秘人物，尤其是考虑她在桑菲尔德的地位问题；不明白那天早晨她为什么没有被关押起来，或者至少被主人辞退。昨天晚上，他几乎已经宣布了，她肯定是犯了罪。是什么神秘的原因阻止他去指控她呢？为什么他也嘱咐我要严守秘密呢？真是奇怪，一位大胆的、爱报复的、自负的绅士，不知怎的似乎受制于一个最卑微的仆人，而且如此受制于她，甚至在她动手要谋杀他的时候，也不敢公开指控她的图谋，更不要说惩罚她了。

如果格雷斯年轻漂亮，我也许还会猜想，或许有一种比谨慎或害怕更为温柔的情感左右了罗切斯特先生，使他偏袒她。可是她面貌丑陋，又是一副管家婆的样子，这种想法也就不大可能成立了。“不过，”我暗忖道，“她也曾青春年少过，那时主人也跟她一样年轻。费尔法克斯太太曾经告诉我，她在这里已住了很多年。我想，她或许从来就没有姿色，但是也许她性格的力量和独特之处弥补了外貌上的不足。罗切斯特先生喜欢果断和古怪的人，格雷斯至少是一个古怪的人。如果是从前一时的任性（像他那种刚愎自用、反复无常的个性，完全有可能干出轻率的事来）使他受她的摆布，行为上的不检点酿成了恶果，使他如今对格雷斯所施加给自己的秘密影响，既无法摆脱，又不能漠视，那又有什么奇怪的呢？”但是，一想到这里，普尔太太宽阔、结实、扁平的身材和丑陋干瘪甚至是粗糙的脸，就清晰地浮现在我的脑海中，使我不由得想：“不，不可能！我的猜想不可能是正确的。可是，”我们内心那个经常和我们对话的秘密的声音又在提醒我，“你也不漂亮，而罗切斯特先生却赞赏你，至少你总是感觉好像他是这样，而且昨天晚上——想想他说的话，他当时的神情，他的声音！”

这一切我都记得清清楚楚：当时的语言、眼神、语调此刻又活生生地重新出现了。我现在正在教室里，阿德拉正在画画，我弯着腰指导她使用画笔，她有些吃惊地抬起头来。

“你怎么啦，小姐？[2]”她说，“你的手抖得像树叶，你的脸红得像樱桃！[3]”

“我这样弯着腰很热，阿德拉！”她继续画她的画，我继续我的思考。

我急于要把对格雷斯·普尔的讨厌想法从脑海中赶走，因为它使我感到厌恶，我把自己与她作了比较，发现我们是完全不同的。贝茜·利文曾说我像一位大家闺秀。她说的是事实，我是一位大家闺秀。而我现在看上去比当初贝茜见我的时候还要好得多。我脸色比以前更红润，人也更加丰满、更有生气、更加活跃，因为我有了更光明的希望和更强烈的乐趣。

“黄昏来临了。”我朝窗子望了望，自言自语地说，“今天我还没有在房间里听到过罗切斯特先生的声音和脚步声。不过天黑之前我肯定能见到他。早上我害怕和他见面，而现在却渴望和他见面。因为我的期望总是落空，所以真有点不耐烦了。”

夜幕降临，阿德拉离开我到保育室去和索菲一起玩了，我急切地盼望着能见到他。我等待着听到楼下响起铃声，等待着听到莉娅带着口信上楼。有时还在恍惚中听到罗切斯特先生的脚步声，于是转向门口，期待着门一开，他走了进来。但门依然紧闭着，只有夜色透进了窗户。不过现在还不算太晚，他常常到七八点钟才派人来叫我，而此刻才六点。今天晚上我肯定不会完全失望，因为我有那么多的事情要告诉他，我要对他再次谈起格雷斯·普尔，听听他会怎么回答，我要直截了当地问他，他是否能确信，昨天晚上那可怕的图谋是她干的；如果是的，他又为什么替她的恶劣行径保密。至于我的好奇心会不会激怒他，那倒没什么关系，我明白那种不断惹他生气再抚慰他的乐趣，这是最令我享受的事情。而且有一种可靠的直觉总是能使我避免做得过头。我从不冒险越过使他动怒的界线，但是我却很喜欢在危险的边缘上试一试身手。在既不忽略表示尊敬的每一个细节、又谨守与我的身份相符的规矩的同时，我仍然能毫不畏惧或者是毫无拘束地和他争论，这样对我们两个人都合适。

楼梯上终于响起了咯吱咯吱的脚步声，是莉娅来了，不过她只是来通知茶点已经在费尔法克斯太太房间里摆好了，我朝那里走去，心里很高兴，至少可以到楼下去了。我想，这样我离罗切斯特先生就更近了。

“你一定想用茶点了，”到了她那里以后，这位善良的太太说，“午饭你吃得那么少，我担心，”她继续说道，“你今天不太舒服。你看上去脸色通红，像是在发烧。”

“哦！很好，我觉得再好不过了。”

“那你得用好胃口来证实一下，你给茶壶续上水，让我织完这一针好吗？”干完她的活儿，她起身把一扇开着的百叶窗放下来。大概没有关窗是为了充分利用日光吧，虽然这时已是暮色沉沉，天色一片朦胧了。

“今天晚上天气不错，”她透过窗玻璃往外看着，“虽然没有星光，罗切斯特先生出门总算遇上了好天气。”

“出门？——罗切斯特先生到哪里去了呢？我不知道他出去了。”

“噢，吃过早饭他就走了！他去了里斯，埃希顿先生那儿，在米尔科特的另一边，离这儿十英里，我想那儿大概有很多客人，英格拉姆勋爵、乔治·林恩爵士、登特上校等都在。”

“您估计他今晚会回来吗？”

“不——明天也不会回来。我想他很可能待上一个星期，甚至更长。这些杰出的上流社会的人物相聚，气氛欢快，各种娱乐应有尽有，所以他们是不会急于分手的。而在这样的场合，尤其需要绅士们。罗切斯特先生既有才能，在社交场中又很活跃，我想他一定受到大家的欢迎。女士们都很喜欢他，尽管你会认为，他的相貌在她们眼里并不特别招人喜爱。不过我想，他的学识、能力，也许再加上他的财富和出身，就能弥补他外貌上任何小小的缺点了。”

“里斯那儿有贵妇小姐吗？”

“有埃希顿太太和她的三个女儿——都是举止文雅的年轻小姐。还有尊敬的布兰奇和玛丽·英格拉姆，我看她们两个都是非常漂亮的女人。其实我在六七年前见过布兰奇，当时她才十八岁。她来这里参加罗切斯特先生举办的圣诞舞会和宴会。如果你能亲眼看看那天的餐厅就好了——布置得那么豪华，那么灯火辉煌！我想大概有五十位女士和先生在场——都是来自郡里的上等人家。英格拉姆小姐是那天晚上公认的美女。”

“您说您见过她，费尔法克斯太太。她长得怎么样？”

“是呀，我见过她，餐室的门敞开着，而且由于是圣诞期间，所以允许用人们聚在大厅里，听一些女士们唱歌弹琴。罗切斯特先生让我进去，我找了一个安静的角落坐下来看着她们。我从来没有见过那么富丽堂皇的场面。女士们穿着华丽，她们中的大多数——至少是大多数年轻女子，长得很漂亮，而英格拉姆小姐肯定是她们中的皇后了。”

“她长得什么模样？”

“高高的个子、漂亮的胸部、瘦削的肩膀、颀长典雅的脖子、黝黑而洁净的橄榄色皮肤、高贵的五官，眼睛有些像罗切斯特先生，又大又黑，和她身上的珠宝一样明亮。而且，她还有那样一头秀发，乌黑乌黑的，梳理得妥妥帖帖的，脑后盘着粗粗的发辫，额前垂着鬈发，那是我所看到过的最长最光亮的鬈发，她穿着一身纯白色的衣服；琥珀色围巾从肩头披到胸前，在旁边打个结，一直垂到膝盖之下，下端悬着长长的流苏。头发上还戴着一朵琥珀色的花，与她一团乌黑的鬈发形成了对比。”

“她肯定是很受众人倾慕了？”

“一点也不错，不仅仅是因为她长得漂亮，还因为她多才多艺，她是那天唱歌的女士之一，一位先生给她做钢琴伴奏，她还和罗切斯特先生一起表演了二重唱。”

“罗切斯特先生！我不知道他还会唱歌。”

“哦！他可有一副漂亮的男低音的嗓子，对音乐很有鉴赏力。”

“那么英格拉姆小姐呢，她的嗓子怎么样？”

“非常圆润而有力，她唱得很动听。听她唱歌真是一种享受——后来她又弹琴。我不会欣赏音乐，可是罗切斯特先生会。我听他说，她弹得非常出色。”

“这位才貌双全的小姐还没有结婚吗？”

“好像还没有，我猜想她与她妹妹的财产都不多。老英格拉姆勋爵的产业大部分都是限定继承的，他的大儿子几乎继承了所有的产业。”

“不过我不明白，为什么没有一位有钱的贵族或绅士喜欢上她，比如说罗切斯特先生，他很有钱，不是吗？”

“哦！是呀。不过你看，年龄相差太大了。罗切斯特先生已经快四十岁了，而她只有二十五岁。”

“那有什么关系？比这更不般配的婚姻每天都有呢。”

“那是事实，但我觉得罗切斯特先生不会有这种想法的。可是你什么也没吃，从开始吃茶点到现在，你几乎一口都没有尝过。”

“不，我太渴了，吃不下去。让我再喝一杯行吗？”

我正要将话题重新回到原来的路上，继续谈论罗切斯特先生和美丽的布兰奇小姐可不可能结合的问题，阿德拉进来了，谈话就转到了别的方面。

当我又独自一人时，我把刚才听到的情况回忆了一遍，我审视着自己的内心深处，细细地检查那里的思想和感情，努力把那些一直迷失在漫无边际、杂乱无章的想象荒野中的一切，用一只严厉的手坚决地拉回到安全的常识范围之内。

我在自己的法庭上受审。记忆出来作证，陈述了从我昨夜以来珍藏的希望、愿望以及情感，陈述了过去近两周我所沉溺的总的思想状态。理智站出来，以她独有的沉静的方式叙述一个朴实无华的故事，揭示了我如何拒绝现实，而去疯狂地吞噬空想。我宣布了如下的判决：

世上还不曾有过比简·爱更傻的傻瓜，还没有一个更异想天开的白痴，曾经过量吞食了甜蜜的谎言，把毒药当做美酒吞下。

“你，”我说，“是罗切斯特先生喜欢的人吗？你有让他喜欢的天赋吗？你有哪方面对于他来说是举足轻重的吗？滚开！你的愚蠢让我恶心。而你还因为人家偶尔表示出来的喜爱而沾沾自喜——殊不知这是一位名门绅士，一位精于世故的人，对一位下属和一个初出茅庐的人所做的暧昧的表示。你竟然那么大胆！可怜的愚蠢的受骗者！难道连自身利益的考虑都不能让你变得聪明一些吗？今天早上你还反复重温着昨夜那短短的一幕？——蒙起你的脸，感到羞愧吧。他说了几句称赞你眼睛的话，是吗？盲目的自我陶醉者，睁开你那双模糊的眼睛，瞧瞧你自己该死的糊涂吧！一个女人受到比她地位高、又无意娶她的人的恭维，可没有什么好处。爱情之火悄悄地在内心点燃，而这种爱情，如果得不到回报或者不被察觉，必定会反过来毁掉培育它的人的生命；而一旦被察觉，得到回报，又一定像鬼火[4]一样，把人引进荒野的泥沼，令人无法自拔。这对任何一个女人来说，都是发疯。

“那么，简·爱，听着对你的判决：明天，把一面镜子放在你面前，用粉笔绘出你自己的画像，要如实画，一个缺点也不能缩小，不能省略任何一处粗糙的线条，不能掩饰任何令人讨厌的不匀称的地方，在下面写上‘孤苦无依、相貌平凡的家庭女教师肖像’。

“然后，拿出一块光滑的象牙[5]——在你的画盒里就有一块，拿出你的调色板，把你最鲜艳、最漂亮、最纯净的色泽调出来，挑出几只最纤细的驼毛画笔，仔细地画出你所能想象出的最漂亮的脸的轮廓，根据费尔法克斯太太对布兰奇·英格拉姆的描述，用最柔和的色调和最悦目的色彩来给她着色。别忘了乌黑的头发，东方人式的黑眼睛——什么！你又回过来以罗切斯特先生作为模特儿，命令你！不准哭鼻子！——不准多愁善感！——不要懊悔！我只容许理智和决心。回忆一下那庄重而和谐的脸，希腊式的脖子和胸部，露出一条让人目眩神迷的圆润的胳膊来，还有一只纤纤细手。不要省掉钻石耳环和金手镯。如实地画下衣服、薄薄的花边、闪闪发光的缎子、雅致的长披巾和金色的玫瑰花，把这幅肖像题为‘多才多艺的名门闺秀布兰奇’。

“将来无论何时，你偶尔幻想罗切斯特先生对你有好感的时候，就把这两张肖像拿出来比较一下，说：罗切斯特先生也许能赢得那位高贵女士的爱情，如果他努力的话。他难倒会费心来认真考虑这个贫穷卑微的平民女子吗？”

“我会这么做的。”我下定了决心。决心已定，我的心里平静下来，于是便沉沉睡去。

我说到做到，只用了一两个小时就用蜡笔画成了自己的肖像。而完成一幅想象中的布兰奇·英格拉姆象牙微型画，却花了将近两个星期的时间。那是一张足够可爱的脸，拿它与粉笔画的真人头像一比，其对比之强烈几乎超过了自制力所能承受的程度。我受益于这一工作。它使我的头脑和双手都没有空闲，而且使我希望在我心里烙下的不可磨灭的新印象更加强烈，更加不可动摇。

没过多久，我就有理由庆幸自己在迫使自己的情感服从必要的纪律方面所取得的进展。多亏这样，我才能以得体的镇静来面对后来发生的种种事情；不然，如果我毫无准备的话，我或许连表面上的镇静都无法做到。

第十七章


一个星期过去了，没有一点儿罗切斯特先生的消息，十天过去了，他还是没有回来。费尔法克斯太太说：如果他直接从里斯去伦敦，又从那儿转道去欧洲大陆，一年内不再在桑菲尔德露面，她也不会奇怪的。像他这样突然不辞而别，对他来说是常有的事。听到这些，我的心里奇怪地打了个冷战，若有所失。实际上，我是任凭自己陷入一种令人厌恶的失落感。不过我竭力恢复理智，重建了原则，立刻使自己的情绪恢复了正常；说来也让人惊奇，我终于纠正了这一时的过错——清除了认为有理由为罗切斯特先生的行动担心的错误想法。我并没有怀着奴性的自卑感，相反，我只是说：

“你和桑菲尔德的主人没有任何关系，你只不过是拿了他给的工资，去教他的被监护人，并且感谢他对你适当的尊重和礼遇而已，不过这也是由于你尽职尽责理所应得的。要清楚，这是你与他之间他认真承认的唯一关系。所以不要把你的柔情、你的喜悦、你的痛苦等等系在他身上。他不属于你的阶层。记住你自己的社会地位吧，要自重，不能把全心全意的爱，徒然浪费在不需要甚至不屑于接受这份礼物的人身上。”

我平静地干着每天的工作。不过脑海中时时隐约闪过我要离开桑菲尔德的理由，我不由自主地一再设计起要登的广告，并且对新的工作做出种种猜想。我没有必要去制止这些想法，如果可能，它们也许会生根发芽甚至还会结出果实呢。

罗切斯特先生已经离开两个多星期了，这时邮差送来了一封给费尔法克斯太太的信。

“是主人写来的，”她看了看姓名和地址说，“我看我们马上就会知道他是否打算回来了。”

她拆开封口仔细看着信，我继续喝我的咖啡（我们在吃早饭）。咖啡很热，我把脸上突然泛起的红晕归因于它。不过，我的手为什么抖个不停，为什么我情不自禁地把半杯咖啡洒到了碟子上，我就不想去考虑了。

“是的，有时候我认为太冷清，可是现在可有机会够我们忙了，至少得忙上一阵子。”费尔法克斯太太说，仍然把信纸举在眼镜前。

在我允许自己要求解释之前，先系好了阿德拉碰巧松开的围裙带子，又帮她拿了块儿小面包，给她的杯子再倒满牛奶，接着若无其事地问道：

“我想，罗切斯特先生不会马上回来吧？”

“不，他就要回来了——他说三天以后，也就是这个星期四，而且不是他一个人。我不知道有多少里斯的贵客要和他一起来。他吩咐准备好最好的卧室，图书室与客厅都要打扫干净。我还要从米尔科特的乔治旅馆和其他能找到人的地方再叫些厨房帮工来。女士们都带着女仆，先生们也都带男仆。所以，我们房子里要住满人了。”费尔法克斯太太匆匆咽下早饭，急急忙忙去工作了。

这三天，正如她所预想的，十分忙碌。我本以为桑菲尔德的所有房子都纤尘不染，收拾得很好；但看来我错了，他们找来三个女工帮忙。擦呀，刷呀，洗漆具，拍打地毯，把画拿下又挂上，擦拭镜子和枝形挂灯，在卧室生火，在壁炉旁烘晒床单和羽绒褥垫，这种情景不论过去还是以后我都没有见过。在一片忙乱之中，阿德拉变野了；为迎接客人做准备，盼望着客人的到来，似乎使她欣喜若狂。她会让索菲把她所有所谓的“衣服[1]”都查看一下，把那些“旧的[2]”都翻新，把新的晾一晾放好。她自己呢，什么也不干，只顾在房前跑来跑去，在床上跳上跳下，有时候来到烧得噼啪作响的炉火前，躺在床垫和堆起来的靠垫和枕头上。功课也全免了，因为费尔法克斯太太拉我做了帮手。我整天待在贮藏室，给她和厨师帮忙（或者说是添麻烦），学做牛奶蛋糕、奶酪蛋糕和法国糕点，捆扎野味和装饰一碟碟的甜点心。

这批客人预计星期四下午到达，正好赶上六点钟的晚餐。在等待期间，我没有时间去胡思乱想了。我想我和其他人一样活跃，一样高兴——阿德拉除外。不过我的欢乐时常像给泼上冷水似的，我会感到沮丧，会情不自禁地回想起那些疑惑、警告和不祥的猜测。那就是当我偶尔看到三楼楼梯的门慢慢地打开（近来它一直锁着），格雷斯·普尔戴着整洁的帽子，系着围裙，揣着手帕，走出来的时候。我看着她穿着布拖鞋，一声不响地走过走廊。我看见她往忙乱的卧房里看了看，也许是跟打杂的女工说上一两句话，教她们如何擦亮炉栅，如何清理大理石壁炉架，如何从糊了墙纸的墙上除去污迹，说完便匆匆地走了。她一天下楼一次，到厨房吃饭，在炉边有节制地吸一斗烟，然后就带上一罐黑啤酒回到楼上自己那个阴暗的住所去独自享用。一天二十四小时中，她只有一小时与楼下别的用人待在一起，其余的时间都是在三层楼上一个橡木卧室低矮的天花板下度过的。她坐在那里做着针线活——也许还暗自阴沉地大笑起来——形单影只，像监狱里的犯人。

最奇怪的是，除了我，房子里没有人注意到她的习惯，也无人对此表示诧异。没有人议论她的地位或工作，没有人同情她的孤独冷清。其实，我一次偶尔听到了莉娅和一个打杂女工关于格雷斯的一段对话，莉娅先是说了什么话，我没听清楚，打杂女工回答道：

“估计她的薪金很高。”

“是呀，”莉娅说，“但愿我的薪金也这么高。这倒不是说我有什么值得抱怨的——因为桑菲尔德府是从不吝啬的，不过我拿的薪金还不到普尔太太的五分之一。她还在存钱呢，一季度要去一次米尔科特的银行。我一点不怀疑她要是想走的话，攒下的钱足够她养活自己了。不过我想她在这儿已经待惯了，更何况她还不到四十岁，身强力壮，干什么活儿都还行，要放弃工作是太早些了。”

“我想她是个干活的好手。”打杂女工说。

“啊——她明白自己该干什么——她比谁都清楚。”莉娅意味深长地回答说，“不是谁都干得了她的活的，就是给和她一样多的钱也干不了。”

“的确干不了！”对方回答，“不知道主人——”

打杂女工还想往下说，这时莉娅回过头来，看到了我，便立即用胳膊肘顶了顶她的伙伴。

“她不知道吗？”我听见那女人悄悄问。

莉娅摇了摇头，于是谈话就到此为止。我从这里所能猜测到的只是：在桑菲尔德有一个秘密，而我则被有意排除在这个秘密之外。

星期四到了，一切准备工作都已在前一天晚上完成。地毯铺开了，床帐挂上了彩条，雪白耀眼的床罩也铺好了，梳妆台已经安排妥当，家具都擦得干干净净，花瓶里插满了鲜花。卧室和客厅都已尽可能收拾得焕然一新；大厅也已经擦洗过，巨大的木雕钟，楼梯的台阶和栏杆都已擦得像玻璃一般闪闪发亮。餐室里，餐具柜里的各式各样的盘子光亮夺目；在客厅和起居室内，一瓶瓶异国鲜花，在四周灿然绽放。

到了下午，费尔法克斯太太穿上了她最好的黑缎袍子，戴上手套和金表，因为要由她来接待客人，把女士们领到各自的房间里去，等等。阿德拉也要打扮起来，虽然我认为，至少在那天，她不大有机会见客人。但为了让她高兴，我让索菲给她穿上了一件宽松的麻纱短上衣。至于我自己，是没有必要换装的，不会把我从教室叫出来的，这间教室如今已经成了我的密室，成了我“患难时愉快的避难所”。

这是个温和宁静的春日，是三月末四月初预示着夏季即将到来的日子。这时已近日暮，但黄昏时更加暖和，我坐在教室里工作，窗子敞开着。

“时候不早了，”费尔法克斯太太的缎子衣服窸窣作响，她走进房间说，“幸亏我订的饭菜比罗切斯特先生说的时间晚一个小时，现在已经过了六点了。我已派约翰到大门口去，看看路上有没有什么动静。从那儿往米尔科特的方向望去，可以看得很远。”她走到窗前。“约翰在那儿！”她说，“嗨，约翰！（她探出身子）有消息吗？”

“他们来了，太太，”他回答道，“十分钟后就到。”

阿德拉朝窗子飞奔过去。我跟在后面，小心地站在窗子一边，让窗帘遮掩着，这样我可以看得清清楚楚，却不被人看见。约翰所说的那十分钟似乎很长。不过终于听到了车轮声。四位骑手沿着车道疾驰而来，两辆敞篷马车尾随其后。车内面纱飘拂，羽毛摆动。有两位骑士是看上去颇为时髦的年轻绅士；第三位是罗切斯特先生，骑着他的黑马梅斯罗，派洛特跳跃着奔跑在他前面；他身边是一位女士，两人走在队伍的最前边。她那身紫色的骑装几乎拖到了地上，长长的面纱在微风中飘动，乌黑浓密的鬈发和透明的褶皱绕在一起，透过面纱闪动着光芒。

“英格拉姆小姐！”费尔法克斯太太嚷着，急忙下楼去履行她的职责了。

这队人马沿着车道很快转过屋角，在我视线中消失了。这时阿德拉要求下楼。我把她搂在膝头，让她明白无论是现在，还是以后什么时候，除非有人特地来叫她，否则她绝不可以冒冒失失地出现在女士们面前，因为罗切斯特先生会生气的，等等。听了这些话，她流了一些自然会流下的眼泪，不过见我神情严肃，她也终于同意把眼泪擦掉了。

这时可以听到大厅里一片欢快的喧哗声：男士们深沉的语调与女士们银铃似的嗓音和谐地混合在一起。其中最清晰可辨的是桑菲尔德主人那虽不大却很洪亮的声音，对这些贵宾们的光临表示欢迎。随后，这些人脚步轻快地上了楼梯，穿过走廊，还有伴随着柔和欢快的笑声和开门关门的声音。随即便暂时安静下来。

“她们在换装。[3]”阿德拉说。她仔细听着，注意着每一点动静，接着她叹了口气，说：“在妈妈家里时，有客人来，总是让我到处跟着，到客厅，到她的房里，我经常看到使女们给太太小姐们梳头、穿衣。那很有趣，还能长见识。[4]”

“你觉得饿了吗，阿德拉？”

“饿了，小姐，我们已经有五六个小时没吃东西了。[5]”

“好吧，趁女士们都在自己房间里的时候，我冒险下去给你拿点吃的来。”

我小心翼翼地走出自己的避难所，找了一条直通厨房的后楼梯下去。那里火光熊熊，一片混乱，汤和鱼都已到了最后烹饪阶段，厨娘弯腰在锅台上忙活着，全身心地紧张着。在用人屋里，两个马车夫和三个绅士的仆从围着火炉或站或坐；女仆们想必在楼上同小姐们在一起。从米尔科特新雇来的用人也到处忙个不停。我穿过这一片混乱，终于到了食品室，拿了一只冷鸡、一卷面包、几块馅饼、一两个盘子和一副刀叉。我带着这份“战利品”急忙撤退，重新登上走廊，正要随手关上后门时，一阵越来越响的嗡嗡声提醒我，女士们马上就要从房间里走出来了。我回到教室去，就必须经过这几间房门，就得冒着端着一大堆食物被她们撞见的危险；因此，我一动不动地站在走廊的这一头。这里没有窗子，光线很暗：此刻天色已黑，因为太阳已经落山，暮色越来越浓了。

不一会儿，房间里美丽的女住客一个接一个出来了，个个心情欢快，步履轻盈，衣服在昏黄的暮色中闪闪发光。她们聚集在走廊的另一头，站了片刻，用轻快动听的语调低声交谈着，然后毫无声息地走下了楼梯，仿佛是一团明亮的雾从山上降落下来。她们的外貌给我留下的总的印象是：出身高贵，形象优雅，这是我以前从未见识过的。

我发现阿德拉从教室的门缝偷看。“多漂亮的小姐！”她用英语叫道，“啊，我真希望到她们那儿去！你认为晚饭后罗切斯特先生会派人来叫我们去吗？”

“不，真的，我看不会。罗切斯特先生还有别的事情要考虑。今天晚上就别去想那些小姐了，也许明天你会见到她们的。这是你的晚饭。”

她真的饿坏了，因此鸡和馅饼暂时分散了她的注意力。幸亏我弄到了这份食物，不然她和我，还有与我们分享这顿晚餐的索菲，都很可能根本吃不上晚饭。楼下的人都快忙得顾不上我们了。九点以后才送上甜食。到了十点钟，男仆们还端着托盘和咖啡杯子，到处奔跑。我允许阿德拉待到比往常晚得多的时间才上床，因为她说楼下的门不断地开呀关呀，人来人往，她没法睡觉。此外，她还说也许她脱了衣服后，罗切斯特先生会让人捎来口信，“那多可惜呀！[6]”

我给她讲故事，她愿意听多久就讲多久。接着我带她到走廊上解解闷。这时大厅的灯已经点上，阿德拉觉得从栏杆上往下看、瞧着仆人们来往穿梭，十分有趣。夜深了，客厅里传来音乐声，一架钢琴已经搬到了那里。阿德拉和我坐在楼梯的顶端台阶上倾听着。刹那之间响起了一个声音，与钢琴低沉的调子相交融。那是一位小姐在唱歌，歌喉十分动听。独唱过后，二重唱跟上，随后是三重唱，歌唱间歇响起了一阵嗡嗡的谈话声。我久久地听着，突然发现自己的耳朵聚精会神地分析那混杂的声音，竭力要从混沌交融的音调中，分辨出罗切斯特先生的嗓音。我很快将它捕捉住以后，便进而从由于距离太远而变得模糊不清的音调中，猜想出他在说什么来。

时钟敲了十一点。我看了一眼阿德拉，她的头已倚在我肩上，眼皮越来越沉。我把她抱在怀里，送她去睡觉。将近凌晨一点钟，客人们才各自回房。

第二天和第一天一样，天气晴朗，客人们在这一天到附近的某个地方游览。他们上午很早就出发了，有的骑马，有的坐马车。我眼看着他们出发，看着他们归来。像以前一样，英格拉姆小姐是唯一一位女骑手。罗切斯特先生和她走在一起，他们两个人骑着马和其他的客人拉开了一段距离。费尔法克斯太太正与我一起站在窗前，我向她指出了这一点：

“您说他们不大可能想到结婚，”我说，“可是您瞧，比起其他女人来，罗切斯特先生显然更喜欢她。”

“是呀，我想他肯定爱慕她。”

“而且她也爱慕他，”我补充说，“瞧，她的头凑近他，仿佛在说什么悄悄话呢！但愿能见到她的脸，我还从来没见过一眼呢！”

“今天晚上你会见到她的。”费尔法克斯太太回答说，“我偶然向罗切斯特先生提起，阿德拉特别希望能见一见小姐们。他说：‘呵，那就让她饭后到客厅里来吧，请爱小姐陪她来。’”

“噢，他不过是出于礼貌才那么说的，我相信我不必去。”我回答。

“瞧，我对他说，你不习惯交往，所以我想你不会喜欢在这些热闹的客人面前露面；他还是那么急躁地说：‘胡说！如果她不愿意来，就告诉她我特别希望她来。如果她拒绝，你就说，如果她这么倔犟，我要亲自来叫了。’”

“我不愿给他添那么多麻烦，”我回答，“如果没有更好的办法，我就去。但我实在不喜欢。您去吗，费尔法克斯太太？”

“不，我请求不去，他同意了。我告诉你怎样避免那种一本正经入场的尴尬，你得在女士们离席之前，客厅里还没有人的时候进去，找个僻静的角落坐下。男宾们进来之后，你不必待得很久，除非你高兴这么做。只要让罗切斯特先生看到你在那里，随后你就悄悄溜走——没有人会注意到你。”

“您认为这批客人会待得很久吗？”

“也许两三个星期，肯定不会再久了。乔治·林恩爵士由于新近当上了米尔科特市议员，过了复活节假期得去城里就职。我想罗切斯特先生会同他一起去，这次他在桑菲尔德待了那么长时间，真让我奇怪。”

眼看我带着阿德拉进客厅的时刻就要到了，我心里惴惴不安。阿德拉听说晚上要去见女士们，整天都处于极度兴奋的状态，直到索菲开始给她打扮，才安静下来。这时，她意识到了事情的重要性，很快便安安稳稳地待着。待到她鬈发梳得溜光，一束束垂着，穿上了粉红色的缎子罩衣，系好长长的腰带，戴上了网眼无指手套，她看上去已像一位法官那么严肃了。这时已没有必要提醒她别弄乱自己的服装，她穿戴整齐后，便安静地坐在小椅子上，急忙小心地把缎子裙提起来，唯恐弄皱了。还向我保证，她会一动不动坐在那里，直到我准备好为止。我很快就穿好了自己最好的衣服（银灰色的那一件，专为参加坦普尔小姐的婚礼购置的，后来一直没有穿过），把头发梳好，戴上了我仅有的饰品——那枚珍珠胸针，然后我们下了楼。

幸亏还有另外一扇门通往客厅，不必经过他们都坐着吃饭的餐厅。我们看到房间里空无一人，大理石砌成的壁炉中静静地烧着一堆旺火；桌上装饰着精致的花朵，烛光在花朵中孤寂地闪亮着。拱门前悬挂着猩红的帷幔，虽然我们与隔壁餐厅的客人仅一层之隔，但他们说话声音很轻，除了柔和的嗡嗡声，谈话的内容一点都听不清楚。

阿德拉似乎还处于严肃气氛中，一声不响地坐在我指给她的小凳上。我退到一个靠窗的位置，随手从临近的桌子上取了本书，想读下去。阿德拉把她的小凳子搬到我脚边，碰了碰我的膝盖。

“怎么啦，阿德拉？”

“小姐，我能从这些美丽的花朵中摘下一朵吗？我想打扮得更美一点。[7]”

“你对自己的‘打扮[8]’想得太多啦，阿德拉。不过你可以戴一朵花。”我从花瓶里摘下一朵花，插在她的腰带上，她无比满足地松了口气，仿佛这就把她的幸福之杯斟满了。我转过脸去，掩饰自己抑制不住的微笑。这位巴黎小女子天生对服饰的热烈追求，既有几分可笑，又有几分可悲。

这时，响起了客人们轻轻起身的声音，帐幔被撩到了拱门背后，露出了餐厅，只见长长的桌上摆满了盛甜点心的豪华餐具，烛光倾洒在银制的和玻璃制的器皿上。一群女士站在门口，她们走进来，帷幔在她们身后落下。

一共只有八位，可不知怎么她们一起进来的时候，给人的印象远不止这个数目。她们中间有几个个子很高，有几个一身洁白。她们的服装都宽大，仿佛雾气使月亮变大一样，这些服装也把她们的身形变大了。我站起来向她们行了屈膝礼，有一两位点头回礼，其余的只是瞪着眼睛看我而已。

她们在房间里散开，动作轻盈，令我想起了一群覆着白色羽毛的鸟。有些人坐下来，斜倚在沙发和卧榻上，有的俯身看桌子上的鲜花和书籍，其余的人则围坐在火炉旁。大家都用低沉而清晰的声音交谈着，似乎这已成了她们的习惯。后来我知道了她们的姓名，现在不妨来提一下。

首先是埃希顿太太和她的两个女儿。她显然曾经是位漂亮的女人，而且保养得很好。她的大女儿艾米个头比较小，有些天真，脸部和举止都透出了孩子气，外表也显得很调皮。她那白色的薄纱礼服和蓝色的腰带很合身。二女儿路易莎的个子要高些，身材也更加优美，脸长得很不错，属于法国人所说的“俏皮面孔[9]”那一类。姐妹俩都像百合花那么白净。

林恩太太四十岁上下，长得又高又壮，腰背挺直，一脸傲气，穿着华丽的绸缎衣服。乌黑的头发在一根天蓝色羽毛和一圈宝石的映衬下闪闪发光。

登特上校太太不像别人那么招摇，不过我认为她更具贵妇风度。她身材苗条，面容白皙温和，头发金黄。她的黑色缎子服、华丽的外国花边围巾以及珍珠首饰，远比那位有爵位的贵妇闪光的艳服更赏心悦目。

但最令人瞩目的是富孀英格拉姆太太与她的女儿布兰奇和玛丽——也许部分是由于她们在这一群人中个子最高。这位太太年龄可能在四十到五十岁之间，但身材依然很好，头发乌黑（至少在烛光下看起来是这样的），牙齿也明显依然完整无缺。多数人都会把她看成是那个年纪中的美人。以形体而言，她无疑是这样。不过她的举止和表情显出一种令人难以容忍的傲慢。她长着一副罗马人的脸相，双下巴与脖子连在一起，像一根粗柱子。在我看来，这样的五官不仅因为傲慢而显得膨胀和阴沉，而且还起了皱纹。她的下巴由于同样的原因总是抬得高高的，几乎到了不自然的程度。此外，她的目光凶狠冷酷，使我想起了里德太太的眼睛。她说话装腔作势，嗓音深沉，声调夸张，语气专横——总之，让人难以忍受。一件深红丝绒袍，一顶用印度金丝织物做的披肩式软帽赋予她（我猜她是这样想的）一种真正的皇家气派。

布兰奇和玛丽都是同样的身材——像白杨一样高大挺拔，玛丽按她的身高来说显得过分苗条了些，而布兰奇长得像个月亮女神。当然我是怀着特殊的兴趣来注意她的。首先，我希望看看，她的外貌是不是同费尔法克斯太太描绘的一样；第二，我想看看她是不是和我凭想象画成的微型肖像画相似；第三，明说吧，看她是否像我设想的那样适合罗切斯特先生的口味。

就外貌而言，她各方面都与我的画和费尔法克斯太太的描绘相吻合。高高的胸部、斜溜的肩膀、优美的脖颈、乌黑的眼睛和黑油油的鬈发——但她的脸呢？活像她母亲的，只是年轻而没有皱纹。一样低低的额头，一样高傲的五官，一样的盛气凌人。不过她的傲慢并不那么阴沉，她常常笑声不断。她的笑里带着嘲讽，这也是她那弯弯的傲气十足的嘴唇常有的表情。

据说天才总有很强的自我意识。我无法判断英格拉姆小姐是不是位天才，但是她有自我意识——而且相当强。她同温文尔雅的登特太太谈起了植物学。而登特太太似乎没有研究过那门学问，尽管她说喜爱花卉，“尤其是野花”。英格拉姆小姐却是研究过的，而且还神气活现地卖弄植物学字眼，我立刻觉察到她在“追猎”（用行话来表达）登特太太，也就是说，在戏弄她的无知。她的追猎也许很高明，但绝不厚道。她钢琴弹得很出色；她唱歌嗓子很优美；她单独和她妈妈在一起时讲法语，她讲得很好，非常流利，发音也很准确。

和布兰奇相比，玛丽的脸显得更温顺坦率，五官更为柔和，皮肤也要白皙几分（英格拉姆小姐像西班牙人一样黑）——但玛丽缺乏生气，面无表情，目光没有神采。她不怎么说话，一坐下来，就像壁龛里的雕像那样，一动不动。姐妹俩都穿着一身洁白的衣服。

那么，我现在是不是认为，英格拉姆小姐有可能成为罗切斯特先生的意中人呢？我说不上来——我不了解他在女性美方面的好恶。要是他喜欢端庄，她正是端庄的典型，而且她多才多艺，充满活力。我想多数有身份的人都会倾慕她，而他确实倾慕她，我似乎已经得到了证实。要消除最后的一丝怀疑，只要看他们待在一起时的情景就行了。

读者啊，您别以为阿德拉始终在我脚边的小凳子上端坐不动，她可不是。女士们一进来，她便站起来，迎了上去，端端正正鞠了一躬，并且一本正经地说：

“太太小姐们，你们好。[10]”

英格拉姆小姐带着嘲弄的神情低头看她，大声说：“啊，好一个小玩具娃娃！”

林恩太太说道：“我想这是罗切斯特先生监护的孩子——他提过的那个法国小姑娘。”

登特太太和蔼地握住她的手，给了她一个吻。艾米和路易莎·埃希顿不约而同地叫道：

“多可爱的孩子！”

随后她们把她叫到一张沙发跟前。此刻她就坐在她们中间，一会儿用法语，一会儿用蹩脚的英语聊天，不但引起了年轻小姐们的注意，就连埃希顿太太和林恩太太也被她迷住了。阿德拉心满意足地受着大伙的宠爱。

最后端上了咖啡，男宾们都被请了进来。如果这个灯火辉煌的房间还有什么幽暗所在的话，那我就坐在暗处，被帷幔半掩着。拱门的帐幔再次撩起，他们进来了。男士们一起登场时的情景，与女宾们一样气度非凡。他们都身着黑色礼服；大多数都身材高大，有几位很年轻。亨利·林恩和弗雷德里克·林恩看上去精神抖擞，生气勃勃；登特上校一身英武之气；地方法官埃希顿先生一副绅士派头，头发很白，眉毛和络腮胡子却依然乌黑，让他有几分像“舞台上的尊贵长者[11]”。英格拉姆勋爵与他的姐妹们一样是高挑个头，很漂亮，但有着玛丽那种冷漠、无精打采的神色；他的四肢好像更加发达，胜过了精力的旺盛和头脑的灵活。

那么，罗切斯特先生在哪儿呢？

他最后一个进来，虽然我没有朝拱门张望，但看到他进来了。我竭力要把注意力集中在钩针和我手边正编织的手提包网眼上——真希望自己只想手头的活，只看见膝上的银珠和丝线；而我却清清楚楚地看到了他的身影，禁不住忆起了上次见到这身影时的情景，那是在他所说的给了他重大帮助以后，他拉住我的手，低头看着我的脸，仔细端详着我，眼神里露出急于倾吐全部感情的目光，而我也是同样的心情。那时，我和他多么贴近啊！从那以后，什么事情刻意使他和我的关系起了变化呢？而现在，我们之间的关系变得多么疏远、多么陌生呀！我们之间已存在隔阂，因此我并不指望他过来和我说话。我也并不感到诧异，他居然连看都不看我一眼就在房间另一头坐下，开始和一些女士们交谈起来。

我一见他注意力都在她们身上，而我完全可以注视他们而不被察觉，我的目光便不由自主地被吸引到了他的脸上。我无法控制我的眼皮，它们总要抬起来，眼珠一定要盯着他。我看着，这给了我一种强烈的快乐——一种甜蜜而辛辣的快乐；是纯金，却又夹杂着痛苦的尖刺。像一个渴得要死的人所体会到的快乐，明知道自己爬近的泉水已经下了毒，却偏要弯腰去喝那宝贵的几口。

“情人眼里出西施”，这话对极了。我的主人那缺少血色的橄榄色的脸，宽大的方额角、又粗又浓的眉毛、深沉的眼睛、粗线条的五官、坚毅而严厉的嘴——处处都显示出活力、决断和意志——按常理并不漂亮，但对我来说远胜于漂亮。它们充满情趣和魅力，将我征服了，使我的感情脱离我的控制，而被他所左右。我并不想去爱他。读者知道，我努力从自己内心深处剪除露头的爱的萌芽，而此刻，一旦与他重新见面，那萌芽又自动复活了，变得碧绿粗壮！他连看都不用看我就让我爱上了他。

我拿他和他的客人们作了比较。他的外表焕发着天生的精力和真正的力量，相比之下，林恩兄弟的风流倜傥、英格拉姆勋爵的懒散文雅——甚至登特上校的英武出众，又算得了什么呢？我对他们的外貌与表情不以为然。但我能想象得出多数旁观者都会称他们英俊迷人、气度不凡，而毫不犹豫地说罗切斯特先生五官粗糙、神态忧郁。我瞧见他们微笑和大笑——都微不足道。烛光中所潜藏的生气并不亚于他们的微笑，铃声中所包含的意义也并不逊于他们的大笑。我看见罗切斯特先生微微一笑——他严厉的五官变得柔和了，他的眼神转为明亮而温存，目光犀利而又甜蜜。这会儿，他和路易莎和艾米·埃希顿交谈着，我不解地看着她们从容接受他那对于我似乎透入心扉的目光。我本以为在这种目光下，她们会垂下眼来，脸上会泛起红晕。但是我却高兴地发现，她们都无动于衷。“他在她们眼里和在我的眼里是不同的，”我想，“他不属于她们那类人。我相信他和我是同类——我确信如此，我和他相似——他的表情和动作中的含意，我都明白。虽然地位和财富把我们截然分开，但我的头脑和心里，我的血液和神经里，有着某种使我与他彼此心灵相通的东西。难道几天前我不是说过，除了从他手里领取薪金，我和他没有关系吗？难道我除了把他看做雇主外，不是不允许自己对他有别的想法吗？这真是违背天性！我的每种善良、真实、生气勃勃的情感，都冲动地朝他涌去了。我知道我必须掩饰自己的情感，抑制自己的愿望，牢记住他不会太在乎我。我说我属于他那类人，并不是说我有他那种影响力、那种迷人的魅力，而不过是说我与他有某些共同的志趣与情感罢了。而我必须不断提醒自己，我们之间永远横亘着一条鸿沟——尽管如此，只要我还在呼吸，还有思想，我就不能不爱他。”

咖啡端来了。男宾们一进屋，女士们便像百灵鸟般活跃起来。谈话转为轻松欢快。登特上校和埃希顿先生在政治问题上争论了起来，他们的太太侧耳静听着。林恩太太和英格拉姆太太两位高傲的寡妇，在促膝谈心。还有乔治爵士，顺便说一句，我忘记描述他了。他是一位个子高大、精神十足的乡绅，现在手里端着咖啡杯，站在沙发前，偶尔插上一句话。弗雷德里克·林恩先生坐在玛丽·英格拉姆旁边，给她看着一本装帧豪华的书里的插画。她看着，不时微笑着，但显然说话不多。高大冷漠的英格拉姆勋爵，抱着双肩，斜倚在小巧活泼的艾米·埃希顿的椅背上。她抬头看着他，像鹪鹩似的唧唧喳喳。在罗切斯特先生与这位勋爵之间，她更喜欢勋爵。亨利·林恩在路易莎的脚边占了一条脚凳，与阿德拉合用。他努力同她说法语，一说错，路易莎就笑他。布兰奇·英格拉姆会跟谁结伴呢？她一个人站在桌边，很有风度地俯身看着一本书。她似乎在等人来邀请，但她不愿久等下去，便自己选了个伴儿。

罗切斯特先生离开了两位埃希顿小姐后，和英格拉姆小姐独自站在桌旁一样，一个人站在火炉旁。她走到壁炉架的另一边，面对着他站定。

“罗切斯特先生，我想你并不喜欢孩子？”

“我是不喜欢。”

“那你怎么会想到去抚养这样一个小玩偶呢？（指了指阿德拉）你是从哪儿把她捡来的？”

“我并没有捡，是别人给我的。”

“你该送她进学校。”

“我负担不起，学费那么贵。”

“可是，我想你为她请了个家庭教师，刚才我还看到有个人和她在一起——她走了吗？哦，没有！她还在那边窗帘的后面。当然你付她工钱。我想这一样很贵——更贵，因为你得负担两个人的生活费用。”

我担心——或者我是否该说，我希望？——因为提到了我，罗切斯特先生会朝我这边望过来，所以我不由自主地往阴影里躲，可是他根本没有把目光转到这边来。

“我没有考虑过这个问题。”他漫不经心地说，眼睛直视着前面。

“可不——你们男人从来不考虑经济和常识问题，你该听听我妈妈是怎么讲那些家庭教师的。我想，玛丽和我小时候有过至少一打家庭教师，一半让人讨厌，其余的又十分可笑，反正个个都是噩梦——是不是，妈妈？”

“你说什么，我的宝贝儿？”

被这位遗孀称为特殊财产的年轻小姐，重新说了一遍她的话，并作了解释。

“我的宝贝儿，别提那些家庭教师了，一提到这个词就让我精神紧张。她们乖僻任性、毫不称职，让我吃尽了苦头。谢天谢地，现在我总算摆脱她们了。”

登特太太向这位虔诚的女士俯下身子，向她耳语了一阵。我从对方做出的回答中推测，那是提醒她，她们所诅咒的那类人中的一位，就在现场。

“算了！[12]”这位太太说，“我希望这对她有好处！”随后她压低了嗓门，不过还是高得能让我听见。“我注意到了她，我善于看相，在她身上我看到了她们那类人的缺点。”

“什么缺点，太太？”罗切斯特先生大声问道。

“我会私下告诉你的。”她答道，意味深长地把头巾甩了三下。

“不过要是那样的话我的好奇心会没胃口，现在它急于要吃东西。”

“问问布兰奇吧，她比我更靠近你。”

“哎呀，可别把他交给我，妈妈！对于她们那种人，我只有一句话要说：她们真讨厌。并不是说我吃过她们很多苦头，我倒是刻意要把局面扭转过来。西奥多和我过去是怎样捉弄威尔逊小姐、格雷太太和尤伯特太太的呀！玛丽常常困得厉害，提不起精神来参与我们的阴谋。戏弄尤伯特太太最有趣。威尔逊小姐是个病恹恹的可怜虫，老是哭哭啼啼，愁眉苦脸的。总之，不值得费劲去征服她。格雷太太又粗俗又迟钝，怎么整她她都不在乎。但是可怜的尤伯特太太就不一样啦！我们把她逼得急了，我见她会大发雷霆——我们把茶泼掉，把面包和奶油弄得稀巴烂，把书扔到天花板上，用尺子拍桌子，用炉具敲围栏，闹得翻天覆地。西奥多，你还记得那些欢乐的日子吗？”

“是——呀，当然记得。”英格拉姆勋爵慢吞吞地说，“这可怜的老木瓜还常常大叫‘哎呀，你们这些坏孩儿！[13]’——然后我们就训斥她，说她自己那么无知，竟还想来教我们这些聪明伶俐的孩子。”

“我们确实这么做了，特多[14]，你知道我帮你告发——或者是迫害——你的家庭教师，那个脸色苍白的维宁先生，我们管他叫病鬼教师。他和威尔逊小姐胆大妄为，竟谈起恋爱来——至少特多和我是这么想的。我们当场看到他们温存地眉目传情，唉声叹气，并把这些理解为“恋爱[15]”的表现。我敢保证，大家很快就得益于我们的发现了，我们将它作为杠杆，把压在身上的两个沉重包袱撬出门去。亲爱的妈妈稍一听到关于这件事的风声，就断定了这是件伤风败俗的事。是这样的吗，我的母亲大人？”

“当然，我的宝贝。而且我十分正确。相信我的话，有千万条理由说明，在任何一个规矩的家庭里，男女家庭教师私通都是一刻也不能容许的。首先——”

“哎呀，妈妈，别给我们一一列举啦！再说[16]，我们都知道。那会给童年的纯真树立坏榜样；热恋者相依相伴，魂不守舍，会导致失责；而狂妄自大——傲慢无礼也会随之而生——会造成冲突和对抗的总爆发。我说得对吗，英格拉姆庄园的英格拉姆男爵夫人？”

“我的百合花，你说得很对，你一向很对。”

“那就不必再说下去了，换个话题吧。”

艾米·埃希顿不知是没有听见，还是没有注意到这一声明，用她那孩子般柔声细气的腔调说：“路易莎和我，以前也常常戏弄我们的家庭教师，不过她真是个好人，什么都能忍耐，怎么整她都不会生气。她从来没有对我们发过火，是不是这样，路易莎？”

“不错，从来不发火。我们爱怎么干就可以怎么干。搜查她的书桌和针线盒，把她的抽屉翻得底朝天。而她的脾气却那么好，我们要什么她都给。”

“现在我想，”英格拉姆小姐撅起嘴唇嘲讽地说，“我们要为全体家庭女教师编一个回忆录摘要了。为了避免这场灾难，我再次提议换一个新话题，罗切斯特先生，你赞成我的提议吗？”

“小姐，无论是这件事还是别的事情，我都支持你。”

“那得由我把这件事提出来了，爱德华先生[17]，今晚你的嗓子行吗？”

“英格拉姆小姐[18]，只要你下命令，我就唱。”

“那么，先生[19]，我传旨清一清你的嗓子和其他发音器官，来为皇家效力。”

“谁不甘愿做如此神圣的玛丽的里丘[20]呢？”

“里丘算得了什么！”她大声说着，把满头鬈发一甩，朝钢琴走过去，“我认为提琴手戴维肯定是个枯燥乏味的家伙。我更喜欢黑皮肤的博斯威尔[21]。我觉得，一个男人如果没有一点魔鬼气质就一文不值。不管历史怎样对詹姆斯·赫伯恩说长道短，我觉得，他就是那种我愿意下嫁的狂野、凶狠的绿林豪杰。”

“先生们，你们听着：你们中谁最像博斯威尔？”罗切斯特先生嚷道。

“应当说你最够格。”登特上校立即呼应。

“我发誓，我对你感激之至。”他回答道。

英格拉姆小姐此刻坐在钢琴前面，矜持而姿态万千，雪白的长袍堂皇地铺开。她一边开始弹起了灿烂的前奏曲，一边还交谈着。今晚她似乎趾高气扬。她的言辞和派头似乎不仅是为了博得听众的赞叹，而且要使他们感到惊讶。显然她一心要给人留下深刻的印象，觉得她潇洒而大胆。

“我真讨厌今天的年轻人！”她一边飞快地弹奏着，一面说道，“这些弱小的可怜虫，不敢越出爸爸的庄园门一步，没有妈妈的准许和保护，甚至还不敢走这么远。这些家伙关心的是漂亮的面孔，白皙的双手和一双小脚，仿佛男人与美有关似的，仿佛可爱不是女性的特权——不是她们的合法附属品和遗传物！我同意一个丑陋的女人是造物主白净脸上的一个污点。至于男人们，让他们只关心拥有力量和勇气吧，让他们把打猎、射击和争斗作为座右铭。其余的则一钱不值。如果我是个男人，我就这样做。”

“不论何时结婚，”她停了一下，见没有人插话，于是又继续说，“我决定，我的丈夫不应当和我平起平坐，而只能是个陪衬，我不允许王者的身旁有竞争者的存在；我需要绝对忠心。不允许他既忠于我，又忠于他镜中看到的影子。罗切斯特先生，现在唱吧，我给你伴奏。”

“我唯命是从。”这便是她得到的回答。

“这里有一首海盗歌。你知道我喜欢海盗，因此你要唱得精神饱满一点。[22]”

“英格拉姆小姐的圣旨一下，连牛奶和水也会产生灵性。”

“那么，小心点儿，要是你不能使我满意，我会教你应当怎么做，而让你丢脸。”

“那是对无能的一种奖赏，现在我要努力让自己失败。”

“小心一点！[23]如果你故意出错，我要做出相应的惩罚。”

“英格拉姆小姐应当手下留情，因为你能够做出使凡人无法承受的惩罚。”

“哈哈！你解释一下！”小姐命令道。

“请原谅，小姐。不需要解释了。你敏锐的直觉一定会告诉你，你一皱眉头就足可以抵得上死刑。”

“唱吧！”她说着，再一次用手指触摸钢琴，开始了精神抖擞的伴奏。

“现在我该溜了。”我思忖道，但是那富有穿透力的声调吸引了我。费尔法克斯太太曾说过，罗切斯特先生的嗓子很好。确实，他有一副圆润、洪亮的男低音嗓子。唱的时候他倾注了自己的情感和力量。那歌声透过耳朵，灌进了心田，神奇地唤醒了知觉。我一直等到深沉雄浑的颤音消失——直到嗡嗡的谈话声停顿了片刻后再次响起才离开我躲藏的角落。幸亏边门很近，便从那里走了出去。这里有一条狭窄的走廊通向大厅。穿过过道时，我发觉自己的鞋带松了，停下来跪在楼梯脚下的垫子上把它系上。这时我听见餐室的门开了，一位男士走了出来。我急忙直起身子，正好和他面对面站着，原来是罗切斯特先生。

“你好吗？”他问。

“我很好，先生。”

“刚才在房间里，你为什么不走过来和我说话呢？”

我想我本可以反问这个问题，但我不愿那么放肆，只是回答说：

“我不想打搅您，因为您好像正忙着呢，先生。”

“我不在家的时候，你干些什么呢？”

“没有什么，照常教阿德拉。”

“而且比以前苍白了——这我一眼就看出来了，你怎么啦？”

“没事儿，先生。”

“是不是在你差点淹死我的那天夜里着了凉？”

“绝对没有。”

“回到客厅里去吧，你走得太早了。”

“我累了，先生。”

他看了我一会儿。

“而且心情有点不好，”他说，“什么事儿？告诉我。”

“没有——真的没有，先生。我没有心情不好。”

“可是我可以肯定你心里不高兴，而且，只要再说几句你就要掉泪了——其实此刻你的眼泪已经在闪动了，一颗泪珠已从眼睫毛上滚下，落在石板地上了。如果我有时间，如果不是我怕撞见一本正经爱饶舌的仆人，我肯定会弄清楚这到底是怎么回事的。好吧，今晚我就让你走。不过你得知道，只要客人们还在这里，我希望你每天晚上都在客厅露面。这是我的愿望，不要置之不理，现在你走吧，叫索菲来把阿德拉带走。晚安，我的……”他停住了，咬紧嘴唇，蓦地离开了我。

第十八章


那段时间是桑菲尔德府欢乐的日子，也是忙碌的日子。同最初三个月我在这儿度过的平静、单调和孤寂的日子相比，真有天壤之别！一切忧郁的感觉都已被逐出窗外，一切令人沮丧的联想也都被遗忘了，到处都充满生气，整天人来人往。过去静悄悄的门廊、空无住客的前排正房，现在一走进去就会遇见漂亮的使女，或者是穿戴讲究的男仆。

无论是厨房、配膳间、仆役室还是门厅，都一样热闹非凡。只有在和煦的春日里，蔚蓝的天空和明媚的阳光，把人们吸引到外面庭院去的时候，几间大客厅才显得空荡沉寂。即使天气不好，接连几天阴雨连绵，也似乎不曾让他们扫兴，室外的娱乐虽然中止，室内的消遣反而更加活跃和多样了。

第一个晚上有人建议改变一下娱乐方式的时候，我还奇怪他们打算干什么。他们说起要玩“字谜游戏”，但我一无所知，一时不明白这个名称。仆人们被叫了进来，餐桌给搬走了，灯光也做了新的布置，椅子面对拱门围成了一个半圆形。罗切斯特先生和其他男宾们指挥着做些变动时，女士们纷纷上楼下楼，按铃呼唤她们的侍女。费尔法克斯太太被叫进来，报告各类披肩、服装和帐幔等家藏物品情况。三楼的一些衣柜都翻遍了，里面的东西，如带裙环的织锦裙、缎子宽身女裙、黑色丝织品、花边飘带等，都由使女们成包地搬下楼来，经过挑选，把选中的东西送进客厅内的小屋里。

与此同时，罗切斯特先生把女士们再次叫到他的身边，挑选她们中的几个加入他这一组。“英格拉姆小姐当然是属于我的了。”他说，然后他又点名要埃希顿家的两位小姐和登特太太。他看了看我，我恰巧在他身边，正在给登特太太松开的手镯扣好。

“你想玩吗？”他问，我摇了摇头。生怕他会坚持，好在没有。他允许我安静地回到平时的座位上去。

他和他的搭档们退到了帐幔后面，而以登特上校为首的一组，在排成半圆形的椅子上坐了下来。其中一位叫埃希顿先生的男士，注意到了我，好像提议邀请我加入他们，但英格拉姆太太立即否决了他的建议。

“不行，”我听见她说，“她看上去太蠢了，玩不了这类游戏。”

不一会儿，铃声响了，帷幕拉开了。在半圆形之内，出现了乔治·林恩爵士用白布裹着的粗笨的身影，他也是由罗切斯特先生选中的。他前面的一张桌子上放着一本大书，艾米·埃希顿站在他身边，身上披着罗切斯特先生的斗篷，手里也拿着一本书。有个不露面的人摇响了欢快的铃声。随后阿德拉（她坚持参加她监护人的一组）蹦蹦跳跳地来到前面，把挽在胳膊上的一篮子花撒向四周。接着英格拉姆小姐优美的身影出现了，她一身洁白，头披长纱，额上戴着玫瑰花环。罗切斯特先生走在她身边，两人一起走向桌子。他们跪了下来，与此同时，一样浑身雪白的登特太太和路易莎·埃希顿，在他们的身后站定。接着无声地表演了仪式。不难看出，这是一场哑剧婚礼。结束时，登特上校和他那一方的人低声商量了一两分钟，然后上校喊道：

“新娘！”罗切斯特先生行了鞠躬礼，随后帷幕落下。

过了好一会儿，帐幕才再次拉开。第二幕表演显得比第一幕准备得更加精心。如我以前所看到的，客厅比餐厅要高出两个台阶，在距最高那个台阶一两码的地方，放着一个硕大的大理石水缸，我认出来那是温室里的一个装饰品——平时里面养着金鱼，周围布满了异国花草——它体积大，分量重，搬到这儿来肯定费了一番周折。

在这个水缸旁边的地毯上，坐着罗切斯特先生，身裹披巾，额缠头巾。他乌黑的眼睛、黝黑的皮肤和穆斯林式的五官，与这身打扮十分般配。他看上去像一位东方的酋长，不是绞死人就是被人绞死的角色。不久，英格拉姆小姐出场了。她也是一身东方装束——一条深红色围巾像腰带似的缠在腰间；一块绣花手帕在鬓角打了一个结；她那美丽的双臂赤裸着，其中的一条高高举起，优美地托着顶在头上的一个坛子。她的体态和容貌，她的肤色和神韵，都让人想起了宗法时代的以色列公主，无疑那正是她要扮演的角色。

她走近水缸，俯身似乎要把水坛灌满。随后再次把坛子举起来放在头上。这时，那个在井边的人似乎在招呼她，请求着什么。“她就急忙拿下瓶来，托在手上给他喝。”[1]接着，他从长袍的衣襟里，取出一个盒子，把它打开，露出华贵的手镯和耳环；她表现出吃惊和赞叹的表情。他跪着把珠宝放到了她的脚下，她的神态和动作中流露出疑惑与喜悦，陌生人替她戴好了手镯，挂好了耳环。这就是以利以谢和利百加[2]的故事，只不过没有骆驼。

猜谜的一方再次交头接耳起来，显然他们对这场戏所表现的究竟是哪一个词或者字，无法达成一致意见。他们的发言人登特上校要求表演一个“完整的场面”，于是帷幕又一次落下。

帷幕第三次拉开，只露出了客厅的一部分，其余部分由一块黑色粗布幔遮住了；大理石水缸已被搬走，代之以一张松木桌和一把厨房用的椅子。蜡烛全都被吹灭了，这一切在一盏羊角式灯笼的幽暗灯光下隐约可见。

在这暗淡的场景中，坐着一个人，双手攥紧放在膝头上，双目紧盯着地上。我知道这是罗切斯特先生，尽管污秽的脸，散乱的服饰（外衣在他的一条胳膊上垂挂着，好像在一场搏斗中几乎是从背上撕下来似的），绝望阴沉的面容，粗糙竖起的头发，几乎让人认不出来。他走动时，铁链叮当作响，他的手腕上戴着手铐。

“监狱！”登特上校大声喊道，字谜被猜中了。

接着是一段充分的休息时间，让表演者恢复原来的服装，他们再次走进餐室。罗切斯特先生领着英格拉姆小姐，她正夸奖着他的演技。

“你知道吗，”她说，“在你饰演的三个人物中，我最喜欢最后一个。啊，如果你早出生几年，很可能会成为一个豪爽的绿林绅士！”

“我脸上的煤烟都洗干净了吗？”他向她转过脸问道。

“哎呀！都洗掉了，多可惜呀！歹徒的紫红色脸与你的肤色再般配不过了。”

“那么说，你喜欢劫路的英雄了？”

“英国的绿林好汉仅次于意大利土匪，而意大利土匪稍逊于地中海海盗。”

“好吧，不管我是什么人，记住你是我的妻子，一小时之前我们已结婚，当着所有的目击者。”她咯咯地笑起来，脸上泛起了红晕。

“现在，登特，”罗切斯特先生继续说道，“轮到你们了。”另一组人退下去以后，他和他的伙伴们便在空出来的位置上坐了下来。英格拉姆小姐坐在首领的右侧，其余的猜谜人坐在他们两旁的椅子上。这时我不去观看演员了，不再兴趣十足地等这帷幕开启，我的注意力已被观众所吸引。我的目光刚才还盯着拱门，此时已不可抗拒地转向了排成半圆形的椅子。登特上校和他的搭档们玩的是什么字谜游戏，选择了什么字，如何圆满地完成自己扮演的角色，我都不记得了。但每场表演后互相商量的情景，却仍历历在目。我看到罗切斯特先生转向英格拉姆小姐，英格拉姆小姐又转向罗切斯特先生，我看见她向他侧过头去，直到她乌黑的鬈发几乎擦到了他的肩头，拂过他的脸颊。我听见他们互相耳语，我记得他们交换眼色。甚至连目睹当时的情景涌起的某种感情，也至今记忆犹新。

我曾告诉过您，读者，我意识到自己爱上了罗切斯特先生。我绝不会停止爱他，仅仅因为发现他不再注意我——因为我在他面前待上几个小时，而他连看都不看我一眼——仅仅因为我看到他的全部注意力都被一位贵族小姐所吸引，而这位贵族小姐连路过我身边时都不屑于让长袍的边碰我一下，她傲慢的黑眼睛即使偶尔落在我身上时，也会立即移开，就好像是看到了卑微而不值一顾的东西。我不可能不爱他，仅仅因为断定他很快会娶这位小姐——仅仅因为我每天觉察到，她高傲地觉得他肯定会娶她的；即使我随时都看到他那副求爱的神态——那神态虽然显得漫不经心，好像在等待被人追求而不是主动追求别人似的；但正因为漫不经心，更显得富有魅力，正因为傲慢，更显得不可抗拒。

这种情况虽然很可能会产生绝望，但丝毫不会使爱情冷却或消失。读者呀，如果处于我这样地位的女人，敢去妒忌像英格拉姆小姐那样地位的女人的话，读者啊，您也许会认为有许多东西会引起忌妒吧。但是我并不忌妒，或者是很少忌妒——我所经受的痛苦不能用这两个字来解释。英格拉姆小姐不是一个值得妒忌的对象，她不值得引起这种感情。请原谅这看上去自相矛盾的话：我是认真的。她喜欢卖弄，却缺乏诚意。她外表很美，多才多艺，但头脑肤浅，心里天性贫瘠；在这样的土地上是不会自动开出花朵的，没有经过强迫的天然果实是不会喜欢这样的新土的。她并不善良，没有独创性，而惯于重复书本中的大话，从不提出，也从来没有自己的见解。她鼓吹高尚的情操，但并不知道同情和怜悯，身上丝毫没有温柔和真诚之处。随时暴露这一点的是，她常常无端发泄对小阿德拉的恶意反感。如果小阿德拉偶尔走近了她，她会用恶毒的言语把她撵走，有时命令她离开房间，常常冷淡恶毒地对待她。除了我，还有一双眼睛也注视着这些个性的流露——密切急迫而敏锐地注视着。是的，就是罗切斯特先生这位准新郎，也无时无刻不在注视着他的未婚妻。正是这种清醒——他的戒备——这种对自己美丽的爱人的缺点清醒全面的认识，正是他在感情上对她明显缺乏热情的迹象，引起了我无穷的痛苦。

我看出他要娶她是出于门第观念，也许还有政治上的考虑。因为她的地位和家庭关系与他很相配。我觉得他并没有把自己的爱给她，她也没有资格从他那儿得到这么珍贵的东西。这就是问题所在——也就是我心烦意乱的地方——就是我激动的心情持续不断的原因：她不可能让他迷恋。

如果她立刻获取了胜利，他宣告臣服，虔诚地拜倒在她脚下，我倒会捂住脸转向墙壁（打个比喻），从此死了这条心。如果英格拉姆小姐是一位高尚出色的女人，富有力量、热情、善心和理性，我会与两头猛虎——忌妒与绝望决一死战。即使我的心被掏出来吞噬掉，我也会钦佩她——承认她的出众，默默地度过余生。她的优越越是不容置疑，我就会越加钦慕——我也就越能真正地平静。但实际情况并非如此，目睹英格拉姆小姐想方设法迷住罗切斯特先生，又眼看着这种努力不断落空——她自己却并没有意识到，反而徒劳地幻想，每一支射出的箭都击中了目标，自我陶醉地夸耀胜利，而她的骄傲和自负却把她一心想引诱的对象推得越来越远——看着这些使我马上陷入了无休止的激动和令人痛苦的自制之中。

因为当她失败时，我却看到了她能获得成功的方法。我知道，那些不断擦过罗切斯特先生的胸膛却没有射中而纷纷落在脚下的箭，如果由一个更有把握的射手来射，肯定会射中他骄傲的心——会在他严厉的目光中唤起爱，在嘲弄的脸上唤起柔情。或者更好，不用武器就可以无声地将他征服。

“既然她有接近他的有利条件，为什么却不能进一步地影响他呢？”我不禁问自己，“显然她不可能真正喜欢他，或者至少不是出于真心的爱！如果她是，那她就不必一味地献媚装笑，频送秋波，不必如此装腔作势，卖弄风情了。我似乎觉得，她只要安安静静地坐在他身边，不必张口，也不必左顾右盼，就可以贴近他的心了。我曾见过他一种全然不同的表情，全然不像她此刻拼命向他献媚时他所露出的冷漠态度。但那时的表情是自发的，不是靠低俗的计谋和利己的手腕来索讨的。你只要接受它——他问什么你回答什么，不用弄虚作假；需要时同他说话，不必扭捏作态——而这种表情会越来越浓，越来越温和，越来越亲切，像滋养人的阳光那样使你感到温暖。一旦他们结了婚，她怎样使他高兴呢？我想她不会做到这一点，然而，这是可以做到的；我确信，他的妻子会成为天底下最快乐的女人。”

对罗切斯特先生从个人利益和亲属关系考虑的婚姻计划，我始终没有说过一句谴责的话。我初次发觉他的这一打算时，曾经很诧异。我曾经认为像他这样的人，在选择妻子时不会为这么陈腐的动机所左右。但是我对他们男女双方的地位、教养等问题考虑得越久，就越感到自己没有理由因为罗切斯特先生和英格拉姆小姐按照无疑在童年时就灌输进去的思想和原则行事而责备他们。他们整个阶级的人都奉行这样的原则，我猜想他们也有我无法揣测的理由去恪守这些原则。我似乎觉得，如果我是一个像他这样的绅士，我只会拥抱一个我真正喜爱的妻子。然而我相信一定有某些我不知道的理由使它不被完全采纳，否则我相信全世界肯定会按照我想的那样去做了。

但是，不但在这一点上，在其他方面，我也对我的主人渐渐地宽容了。我逐渐忘记了他所有的缺点，而过去我是紧盯不放的。以前我研究他性格的各个方面，好坏都看，权衡两者，以做出公正的评价。现在我看不到坏的方面了。令人厌恶的嘲弄，一度使我吃惊的严厉，现在看来不过像是一盘佳肴中浓重的调料，有了它，会让人感觉辛辣，没有它，反而感觉平淡无味。至于令人难以捉摸的神情——是不幸还是忧伤，是故弄玄虚还是颓唐沮丧——一个细心的观察者会看到这种表情不时地从他目光中流露出来，但是没等你探测暴露部分的神秘深渊，它又隐匿不见了。它过去曾使我畏惧和退缩，仿佛徘徊在火山似的群山之中，突然感到大地颤抖，看到地面裂开了；这种神情我仍能时不时地看到，而且看到时依旧怦然心动，而并未精神麻木。我不想躲避，只渴望迎头而上，去探个究竟。我觉得英格拉姆小姐是幸运的，因为有一天她可以在闲暇时探查这个深渊，考察它的秘密，分析这些秘密的性质。

与此同时，在我只想着我的主人和他未来的新娘——眼睛只看见他们，耳朵只听见他们的谈话，心里只看着他们的一举一动——其他客人都各自有他们的兴致和乐趣。林恩太太和英格拉姆太太还在一起一本正经地交谈着。彼此点着戴了头巾帽的头，根据谈到的话题，各自举起双手，作着表示惊愕、迷惑或恐惧的手势，活像一对放大了的木偶。温存的登特太太在和好脾气的埃希顿太太聊天，两位太太有时还和我说句客套话，或者朝我笑笑。乔治·林恩爵士、登特上校和埃希顿先生在谈论政治、郡里的事或司法事务。英格拉姆勋爵和艾米·埃希顿在调情。路易莎弹琴唱歌给一位林恩先生听，或者是和他一起弹唱。玛丽·英格拉姆无精打采地听着另一位林恩先生献殷勤的话。有时候，所有的人都不约而同地停止了自己的插曲，来观看和倾听主要演员们的表演，因为罗切斯特先生和英格拉姆小姐——由于与他密切有关，毕竟是全体宾客的生命和灵魂。只要他离开房间一个小时，一种可以觉察到的沉闷情绪便悄悄地漫上客人们的心头，而他再一次进屋必定会给谈话注入新的活跃的激情。

一天，他有事被叫到了米尔科特，要很晚才能回来，大家就特别明显地感觉到缺少了他能活跃气氛的感染力。那天下午下了雨，原定徒步去看新近扎在海村工地上的吉卜赛人营房的事，也只好推迟了。男士们有几位去了马厩，年青的几位和小姐们一起在台球室里打台球。两位富孀英格拉姆和林恩，安静地玩纸牌消遣。登特太太和埃希顿太太拉着布兰奇·英格拉姆小姐一起聊天，她爱理不理地拒绝了；自己先是伴着钢琴哼了一些感伤的曲调，随后从图书室里拿了本小说，傲慢地往沙发上懒洋洋地一躺，准备求助于小说的魅力，来消磨几个钟头无人做伴的无聊时光。除了不时传来楼上玩台球的人们的笑声，整个房间、整个宅子都寂静无声。

快到黄昏了，教堂的钟声提醒人们换装，准备进晚餐的时间到了。就在这时，在客厅里跪在我身边窗台上的阿德拉突然大叫起来：

“罗切斯特先生回来啦！[3]”

我转过身去，英格拉姆小姐从沙发上一跃而起，其余的人也停下各自干的事抬起头来；这时，可以听见砂石路上传来了车轮的吱嘎声和马蹄溅水的声音，一辆驿站马车驶了进来。

“他怎么会现在回来呢？”英格拉姆小姐说道，“他出门时骑的是梅斯罗（那匹黑马），不是吗？还带着派洛特——他把马和狗怎么样啦？”

她说这话时，高高的身躯和宽大的衣服紧挨着窗子，弄得我只好竭力把身体向后仰，连脊骨都差一点绷断了。她在急切之中起初并没有看见我，等她一看到我，便撇了撇嘴，到另外一扇窗那儿去了。马车停了下来，驾车人按了按门铃，一位穿着旅行装的绅士跳下车来。不过不是罗切斯特先生，是位看上去很时髦的高个子男人，一位陌生人。

“真气人！”英格拉姆小姐叫起来，“你这个讨厌的猴子！（对阿德拉说）是谁把你弄到窗子上谎报消息的？”她怒气冲冲地瞥了我一眼，仿佛这是我的过错。

大厅里传来了谈话声，没多久，来人走了进来。他向英格拉姆太太鞠躬致意，因为他认为她是在场的人中最年长的妇人。

“看来我来得不巧，太太，”他说，“正巧我的朋友罗切斯特先生出门去了，可是我是远道赶来，作为亲密的老相识，我想冒昧在这儿住下，等他回来。”

他的举止彬彬有礼，但说话口音听来有些异样——不是十足的外国腔，但也不完全是英国口音。他的年龄与罗切斯特先生相仿——在三十到四十岁之间。他的脸色黄得出奇，要不然他倒是个英俊的男人，乍看之下尤其如此。仔细一打量，你会发现他脸上有种不讨人喜欢，或是无法让人喜欢的东西。他的五官很标准，但太松散。他的眼睛很大，也还秀气，但是从中透出的神情却空洞消沉——至少我是这样想的。

通知换装的铃声响了，大家纷纷走散。直到吃晚饭时我才再次见到他。那时他似乎已显得十分自在。但是我却比初见面时更不喜欢他的面相了。我觉得它既不安稳又无生气。他的目光游移不定，毫无目的。这使他显出一副我从未见过的古怪的神情。这样一个漂亮而且看来也并非不和蔼的男人，却让我异常地厌恶。在那皮肤光滑的鹅蛋形脸蛋上看不到力量，那个鹰钩鼻和那张不大的嘴缺少坚毅，在那低平的额头上看不到思想，在那空洞的褐色眼睛里看不到意志。

我坐在我常坐的角落里，打量着他，借着壁炉上把他浑身照得透亮的枝形烛架上的光——因为他坐在靠近火炉的一把安乐椅上，还不住地靠近炉火，仿佛怕冷似的——我把他同罗切斯特先生作了比较。我想（但愿我这么说并无不敬）一只光滑的雄鹅和一只凶猛的猎鹰，一头温顺的绵羊和看守它的皮毛蓬乱、目光犀利的猎狗之间的差别，也不见得比他们两人之间的差别更大。

他说罗切斯特先生是他的故友，那肯定是种奇怪的友谊，真可以说是那句古老谚语“同性相斥，异性相吸”的一个明证。

两三位男士坐在他旁边，我听到了他们在房间另一头谈话的片断。起初我听不大懂，因为路易莎·埃希顿和玛丽·英格拉姆离我更近，她们的谈话使断断续续传到我耳边的只言片语更加模糊不清。路易莎和玛丽正在谈论着那位陌生人，都称他为“美男子”。路易莎说他是位“可爱的人儿”而且“喜欢他”，玛丽则列举了“他漂亮的小嘴和好看的鼻子”，认为这是她心目中理想的魅力所在。

“他有一个多么温顺的额头啊！”路易莎叫道，“那么光滑——没有那种我最讨厌的皱眉蹙额的怪样子，还有那眼神和笑容多么恬静！”

接着，我总算松了口气，因为亨利·林恩先生把她们叫到房间的另一头，去商量关于推迟去海村公地远足的问题了。

现在我可以把注意力集中到火炉边的那群人身上了。我很快就知道那个刚来的人叫梅森先生。然后我知道他刚到英国，来自某个气候炎热的国家，无疑那就是他脸色那么黄、离火炉那么近、在室内穿着紧身长外衣的原因了。不久，诸如牙买加、金斯敦[4]、西班牙城[5]一类字眼，表明他在西印度群岛居住过。没过一会儿，我颇为吃惊地了解到，他在那儿初次见到并结识了罗切斯特先生。他谈起他朋友不喜欢那个地区烤人的炎热，不喜欢飓风和雨季。我知道罗切斯特先生曾是位旅行家，费尔法克斯太太这么说过他。不过我想他游荡的足迹只限于欧洲大陆，在这之前我从未听人提起他到过更遥远的地方。

我正在详细思考这事儿的时候，一件事情，一件颇为意外的事情，打断了我的思路。有人偶然开门时，梅森先生哆嗦着要求在炉子上再加些煤，因为尽管大块煤渣依然通红发亮，但火焰已经燃尽。送煤进来的仆人走出去时凑近埃希顿先生低声对他说了什么，我只听清了“老太婆”“挺讨厌”几个字。

“要是她不走就把她铐起来。”埃希顿法官回答说。

“不——等一等！”登特上校打断了他，“别把她打发走，埃希顿。我们也许可以利用一下，还是问问女士们吧。”接着他大声说道，“女士们，你们不是说要去海村公地看一下吉卜赛人营地吗？现在萨姆说，有个本奇妈妈[6]在仆人的饭厅里，非要让人把她带到‘贵人’面前，替他们算算命。你们愿意见她吗？”

“上校，”英格拉姆太太叫道，“你肯定不会纵容这样一个低级骗子吧？无论如何一定要把她打发走！”

“可是，太太，我没法把她劝走，”仆人说，“别的用人也没有办法，现在费尔法克斯太太正在那儿让她走；可是她索性在壁炉旁的椅子上坐了下来，还说，除非允许她进来，否则她不会离开椅子的。”

“她要干什么？”埃希顿太太问。

“她说‘给贵人们算命’，太太，她还诅咒说必须要算，一定要算。”

“她长得怎么样？”两位埃希顿小姐异口同声地问道。

“一个丑得吓人的老东西，小姐，几乎和煤炭一样黑。”

“啊，她是个地道的女巫呢！”弗雷德里克·林恩叫道，“那还用说，让她进来吧。”

“当然了，”他的兄弟回答说，“如果失去这样一个有趣的机会那就太可惜了。”

“亲爱的孩子们，你们在想什么呀？”林恩太太惊叫起来。

“我绝不能支持这种荒谬的做法。”英格拉姆太太附和说。

“其实，妈妈，你是能够支持的——你会的。”布兰奇傲气地从琴凳上转过身来，用傲慢的语气说，刚才她一直一声不响地坐在那儿，显然是在仔细翻阅各种乐谱。“我很想让人给我算命，所以，萨姆，把那个丑老太婆叫进来吧。”

“布兰奇，我的宝贝！再想一想——”

“我想了——你想让我想的我都想了，我还是得按照我自己的意愿办——快去，萨姆！”

“对——对——对！”年轻的小姐和先生们都齐声叫起来，“让她进来吧——这肯定非常有趣！”

男仆还在迟疑着，“她看上去那么粗鲁。”他说。

“去！”英格拉姆小姐喝道，仆人去了。

所有的人一下子兴奋起来。萨姆返回时，大家正在相互戏谑嘲弄，闹得不可开交。

“她现在不来了，”他说，“她说了她的使命不是到‘一群庸人’——她的话——面前来的。她一定让我带她到只有她一个人的房间里，然后，想要请教她的人得一个一个去。”

“现在你明白了吧，我的女皇布兰奇，”英格拉姆太太开腔了，“她得寸进尺了。听我的话，我天使般的女儿——还有——”

“当然，带她到图书室去。”“天使般的女儿”打断了她的话，“在一群庸人面前听她说话也不是我的使命：我要让她单独跟我谈。图书室里生火了吗？”

“生火了，小姐——可她完全像一个流浪者。”

“住嘴，笨蛋！照我说的去做。”

萨姆又出去了，神秘、激动、期待的气氛再一次高涨。

“她现在准备好了。”仆人再次进来说。

“她想知道她的第一位客人是谁。”

“我想在女士们进去之前，还是先让我去看一看吧。”登特上校说。

“告诉她，萨姆，一位先生要来了。”

萨姆去了又回来了。

“她说，先生，她不见男士，他们不必费心去接近她了。还有，”他好不容易忍住不笑出声来，补充道，“女士们除了年轻单身的也不必见了。”

“天哪！她还挑肥拣瘦呢！”亨利·林恩嚷道。

英格拉姆小姐严肃地站了起来：“我第一个去。”她说，那口气好像她是一位带领部下突围的敢死队队长。

“噢，我的心肝！噢，我最最亲爱的！等一等——再想一想！”她妈妈喊道。但是她神色严肃，一声不响地从她身边走过，走进登特上校为她开着的门，我们听见她进了图书室。

接着是一阵相对的沉寂。英格拉姆太太认为该是搓手的“情况[7]”，于是便搓起手来，玛丽小姐宣称，她觉得换了她是不敢冒险的。艾米和路易莎·埃希顿在小声哧哧地笑着，有点害怕的样子。

时间一分一分过得很慢，图书室的门再次打开时，才数到十五分钟。英格拉姆小姐穿过拱门回到了我们这里。

她会笑吗？还是当做玩笑？所有的人都带着急切好奇的目光看着她，她则是一种拒绝和冷漠的眼神，看上去既没有不安也没有愉快，她身体僵硬地走向自己的座位，默默地坐了下来。

“嗨，布兰奇！”英格拉姆勋爵叫道。

“她说了什么啦，姐姐？”玛丽问。

“你认为怎样？感觉如何？她真的会算命吗？”埃希顿姐妹问。

“好了，好了，你们这些好人，”英格拉姆小姐回答道，“别逼我了，你们真是太容易好奇和轻信了，你们大家——也包括我的好妈妈——都那么重视这件事，似乎绝对相信这屋子里真有一个与恶魔勾结的巫婆。我看到了一个流浪的吉卜赛人，她用陈腐的方法看了看手相，跟我谈了几句她们这类人常说的话。我一时的好奇心已经得到了满足。现在我想，如果埃希顿先生像他威胁过的那样，明天一早把这个丑老婆子铐起来，倒是做了一件好事。”

英格拉姆小姐拿了本书，往椅背上一靠，不愿再和别人交谈了。我观察了她近半个小时，这半个小时内她没有翻过一页书。脸色也越来越阴沉、沮丧、愤怒且流露出失望的表情。显然，她没有听到对她有利的话，她那么长时间地郁郁不欢、沉默不语，但似乎使我觉得，尽管她嘴里说自己不在乎，心里却过于重视刚才听到的不知什么预言了。

这时，玛丽·英格拉姆、艾米和路易莎·埃希顿说什么也不敢独自一人去，却又都希望去试试。通过萨姆这位使者的斡旋，她们开始了一场谈判。萨姆多次往返奔波，小腿想必也跑疼了。最后，终于从这位寸步不让的女巫嘴里讨得许可，让她们三个人一起去见她。

她们的拜访可不像英格拉姆小姐那么安静。我们听见图书室里传来歇斯底里的笑声和一阵阵的尖叫声。大约二十分钟以后，她们猛地推开了门，奔跑着穿过大厅，仿佛被吓疯了似的。

“我敢肯定她有些邪门歪道！”她们一齐叫起来，“她竟然同我们讲了这样的事情！我们的事儿她全知道！”她们各自气喘吁吁地在男士们急忙拿过来的椅子上坐了下来。

大家缠住她们，要求她们详细地说一说。她们说：她给她们讲了小时候说过的话、做过的事，还描绘了她们家中闺房里的书籍和装饰品、亲戚们赠给她们的纪念品。她们说她甚至摸透了她们的想法，在每个人的耳边悄悄地说出她最喜欢的人的名字，告诉她们各自最希望的是什么。

听到这里，先生们插嘴了，强烈地请求她们对最后谈到的两点，进一步透露一下。可他们得到的回答只是她们的脸红、惊叫、颤抖和痴笑。这时，太太们递上了香嗅瓶，给她们摇扇，还因为这几位女士没有及时接受她们一再的劝告而不安；年长的男士们哈哈大笑，年轻的赶紧去给美丽的女士压惊。

在这一片混乱之中，我的眼睛和耳朵都被眼前的情景吸引住了。这时我听见身旁有人清了清嗓子，回头一看，是萨姆。

“对不起，小姐，那个吉卜赛人说，房子里还有一位未婚的年青女士没有去见她，她发誓不见到所有的人是不会走的。这一定指的是你，没有其他人了。我怎么去回复她呢？”

“好，我一定去。”我回答。我很高兴能有这个意外的机会满足我被激起的好奇心。我溜出房间，谁也没有看到我——因为大家聚在一起，围着那三位刚刚回来还一直哆嗦着的三个人——我随手轻轻地关上门。

“如果你愿意的话，小姐，”萨姆说，“我在大厅里等你，如果她吓着你了，你就叫我一声，我会进来的。”

“不用了，萨姆，你回厨房吧，我一点也不害怕。”我真的不害怕，反倒更感兴趣，也很兴奋。

第十九章


我进门的时候，图书室里很安静，那个女巫——如果她确实是的话，正舒适地坐在烟囱角落的安乐椅上。她身披红色斗篷，头戴一顶黑色女帽，或者更确切地说是宽边吉卜赛帽，用一块带条纹的头巾系住，在颏下打了一个结。桌子上放着一根熄灭了的蜡烛。她弯腰对着火炉，似乎在借着火光读一本黑皮小书，像是祈祷书。她一面读，一面像大多数老妇人那样，口中念念有词。我进来时她并没有立即放下书，似乎想把一段读完。

我站在炉边的地毯上，暖了暖冰冷的手，因为在客厅时我坐得离火炉较远。这时我的心情和往常一样平静，确实，吉卜赛人的外表没有什么会使我感到不安的。她合上书，慢慢抬起头来，帽檐遮住了一部分脸。但是她抬起头来时，我还是能看得出那是一张面容古怪的脸。乱发从绕过下巴的白色带子下钻出来，漫过半个脸颊，或者不如说下颚。她的目光立刻朝我看过来，大胆地直视着我。

“噢，你想要算命吗？”她说，口气和她的目光一样坚定，也像她的五官一样严厉。

“我无所谓，嬷嬷，你高兴算就算吧，不过我得提醒你，我并不相信。”

“这话倒是合乎你那莽撞的脾性，我料定你会这样，从你进门时的脚步声里就听出来了。”

“是吗？你的耳朵倒是真灵。”

“不错，而且眼睛亮，脑子快。”

“干你这一行需要这样。”

“是需要，尤其是和你这样的顾客打交道的时候。你怎么不发抖？”

“我并不冷。”

“你的脸为什么不发白？”

“我没有生病。”

“你为什么不请我算一算？”

“我不傻。”

这个干瘪老太婆在帽子和带子底下暗笑了一阵。然后拿出一个短短的烟斗点上，开始抽起来。她在这份镇静剂里享受了一会儿，便直起了弯着的腰，从嘴里抽出烟斗，一面注视着炉火，一面不慌不忙地说：

“你冷，你有病，你很傻。”

“拿出证据来。”我回答。

“我会的，只要几句话便足以证明了。你冷，因为你孤单一人，没有和别人接触来激发你内心的火花。你病了，因为人最美好的、最高尚、最甜蜜的情感，与你无缘。你很傻，因为你尽管痛苦，却总不敢让它靠近你，也不肯朝着它正等你的方向跨出一步。”

她再次把那杆黑色的短烟斗放进嘴里，使劲吸了起来。

“对于你所知道的在大宅子里谋生的任何一个孤单的人，你几乎都可以说这样的话。”

“是几乎对谁都可以这么说，但几乎对谁都适用吗？”

“适合处于我这种情况的人。”

“是的，一点也不错，适合你的情况。不过你给我找出另一个处境和你一模一样的人吧。”

“找出几千个都不难！”

“恐怕你连找一个都困难。如果你知道就好了，你处于一个很特殊的境况之下，离幸福很近，是的，触手可及。条件都已具备，只要动一动手就可以把它拿在手里了。偶然情况还把它们多多少少地分开着，只要让它们接近，肯定会有一个幸福如意的结果。”

“我不懂猜谜。这一辈子我还没猜中过一条谜语。”

“如果想让我说得更明白一些，把手伸出来让我看看。”

“我猜，还得在上面放上银币吧。”

“当然。”

我给了她一个先令。她从口袋里掏出一只旧长袜，把钱币放进去，系好后放回原处。她让我伸出手去，我照办了。她把脸贴近我的手掌，仔细看着，但没有碰它。

“太纤细了，”她说，“这样的手我什么也看不出来，几乎没有皱纹。况且，手掌里会有什么呢？命运又不刻在那儿。”

“我相信你。”我说。

“不，”她继续说，“它刻在脸上，在额头上，在眼睛的周围，就在眼睛本身，在嘴的轮廓上。你跪下，抬起头来。”

“哦！你现在才说到实处了。”我一面按她的话做，一面说，“我现在开始有些相信你了。”

我在离她半码远的地方跪下来。她拨着炉火，那块被她翻动的煤块发出一道火光。不过因为她坐着，那火光只是让她的脸蒙上了更深的阴影，而我的脸却被照亮了。

“我不知道你是怀着什么样的心情上我这里来的。”她仔细打量了我一会儿后说，“你在那边的房间里，接连几个小时枯坐着，看着那帮风雅人物像幻灯中的影子那样晃动着，这时你心里会有什么想法呢？这些人与你没有什么情感的交流，好像不过是外表似人的影子，而不是真实的人。”

“我常常感到疲倦，有时很困，但很少感到悲伤。”

“那一定是有某种秘密的愿望支撑着你，而你对未来的憧憬也使你感到高兴。”

“我才没有呢。我最大的愿望就是积攒下足够的钱，将来自己租一间小小的房子，办一所学校。”

“只靠这么点可怜的养料来寄托精神，而且，老是坐在窗口的那个位置。你瞧，我知道你的习惯——”

“你是从仆人那儿打听来的。”

“呵，你以为自己很机灵吧。好吧——也许我是。说实话，我认识他们其中的一个——普尔太太。”

听到这个名字，我立刻惊跳起来。

“你认识她——是吗？”我心想，“那么，这里面看来是有点魔法了。”

“别惊慌，”这个怪人继续说，“普尔太太很可靠，嘴很紧，话不多。谁都可以信赖她。不过像我刚才说的，你总坐在窗口那个位置，只想着将来办学校，别的什么也没有想？那些坐在你面前沙发上和椅子上的客人，难道你没有对其中哪一位感兴趣吗？你没有研究过其中的一张脸吗？至少出于好奇，对某一个人的举动都没有注意过吗？”

“我喜欢观察所有的面孔和所有的人。”

“不过，难道你就没有从中挑出一个，或者是两个？”

“我的确经常这么做，当两个人的手势和神色中大有故事可听的时候，注视他们对我来说是一种乐趣。”

“你最喜欢听什么故事？”

“呵，我没有多大选择的余地，他们一般总是同一个主题——求婚，而且大都预示着同一灾难性的结局——结婚。”

“你喜欢这单调的主题吗？”

“我一点也不关心，这与我无关。”

“与你无关？有这样一位小姐，她既年轻活泼健康，又美丽动人，而且财富和地位与生俱来，总是微笑着坐在一位绅士面前，这位先生，你——”

“我怎么样？”

“你认识——而且也许还有好感。”

“我并不了解这儿的先生们，我几乎同谁都没有说过一句话。至于对他们有没有好感，我认为有几位高雅庄重，已到中年，其余几位年青、潇洒、漂亮、活跃。当然他们有充分自由，爱接受谁的笑就接受谁的笑，我不必把感情介入其中，考虑这件事与我有何相干？”

“你不了解这儿的先生们吗？你没有同谁说过一句话？对这里的主人你也这么说吗？”

“他不在家。”

“回答真妙！多么高明的诡辩！他今天早上去米尔科特了，要到晚上或者明天早上才能回来，难道因为这你就把他排除在你认识的人之外——仿佛完全抹杀他的存在？”

“不，但我实在不明白罗切斯特先生与你提出的这个话题有什么关系。”

“我刚才谈到女士们在先生们眼前微笑，最近那么多的笑容注进了罗切斯特先生的眼里，他的双眼就像两只满得快要溢出来的杯子，你难道从来没有注意到这些吗？”

“罗切斯特先生有权享受同他的客人们交往的乐趣。”

“毫无疑问，他有这个权利，可是你没有觉察到吗，这里谈论到的婚姻传闻中，罗切斯特先生一直很荣幸地被谈论得最为起劲，谈论的时间也最长吗？”

“越有人爱听就越有人谈得起劲。”这句话，我与其说是说给吉卜赛人听，还不如说是在自言自语。她的奇怪的谈论、声音还有举止把我带进了一种梦境，从她的嘴里说出的一句又一句出乎意料的话让我陷入了一张神秘的网里，我开始怀疑有什么看不见的精灵，几周以来一直守候在我的心灵旁边，注视着它的活动，记录着它的每一个脉搏。

“越有人爱听？”她重复了一遍。“是的，罗切斯特先生整小时地坐在那儿，侧耳倾听着那迷人的小嘴兴高采烈地说个不停；罗切斯特先生是那么乐意接受，而且看起来对于给他的这种消遣，他感激不尽。你注意到这些了吗？”

“感激不尽！我不记得曾经在他的脸上察觉出什么感激之情。”

“察觉！这么说，你还分析过呢。如果不是感激，那你察觉到了什么？”

我什么也没有说。

“你看到了爱情，不是吗？——而且再往前看，你看到了他结婚，看到他的新娘很幸福？”

“哼！不完全是这样。有时候你的巫术也会失灵。”

“那么你究竟看到了什么？”

“别管这个，我到这来是来询问，不是来表白的。不是大家都知道罗切斯特先生要结婚了吗？”

“是的，和漂亮的英格拉姆小姐。”

“很快？”

“种种迹象将证实这一结论——你竟敢大胆提出疑问，真应该受到惩罚——毫无疑问，他们会是非常幸福的一对。他一定会喜爱这样一位美丽、高贵、机智、多才多艺的小姐，而她或许也爱他，或者，即使不是爱他本人，至少也爱他的钱。我知道她对罗切斯特的财产十分满意。虽然——上帝宽恕我——一小时前我就这一点对她谈了谈我的意见，她听了便沉下了脸，嘴角拉下了半英寸。我劝她对她的那位黑脸求婚者当心一点，如果又有一位求婚者，有更多或者更稳固的财产——那他肯定会被淘汰——”

“可是，嬷嬷，我不是来听罗切斯特先生命运的，我是来听自己的命运的，可你一点还没有谈过呢。”

“你的命运还不太明朗。我仔细看了你的脸相，各个特征都是互相矛盾的。命运赐给了你一份幸福，这我知道，是我今晚来这里之前知道的。她已经小心翼翼地替你把幸福放在一边，我看见她这么做的。现在就看你自己伸手去把它拿起来了，不过你会不会这么做，正是我要思考的问题。你再跪在地毯上吧。”

“别让我跪得太久，炉火烤得我难受。”

我跪了下来。她没有向我俯下身来，只是靠在椅背上，紧紧地盯着我。她开始咕哝起来：

“火焰在眼睛里闪烁，眼睛像露水一样发亮；看上去温柔而多情，对我说的话露出微笑；看上去很敏感。清澈的眼球上掠过一个又一个印象。笑容一旦消失，神色便转为忧伤。倦意不知不觉落在眼睑上，露出孤独带来的忧郁。那双眼睛避开了我，受不了进一步的观察，而且投来讥讽的一瞥，似乎要否认我已经发现的事实——既不承认说它敏感，也不承认说它懊丧，它的自尊与矜持却更肯定了我的看法。这双眼睛是讨人喜欢的。

“至于嘴巴，有时爱笑，希望坦露头脑中的一切想法，但我猜，对不少内心的体验却不愿说出。它口齿伶俐，绝不想紧闭双唇，永远安于孤寂沉默。这张嘴爱说爱笑，爱交谈，通情理。这一部分也不错。

“只有额头，我看到了有碍幸福结局的地方，那个额头表白道：‘我可以孤单地生活，如果自尊心和客观环境需要我这样做的话。我不必出卖灵魂去换取幸福。我天生具有一笔内在的财富，即使外界的欢乐全部被剥夺，或者欢乐需要用我难以承受的代价去换取时，它能使我继续活下去。’额头还声明：‘理智稳坐不动，紧握缰绳，却不能让感情像脱缰野马，将自己带入荒芜的深渊。激情会像真正的异教徒那样狂热起来，欲望也可以想入非非，但是判断在每次争执中仍持有决定权，在每一次决策中掌握着决定性的一票。狂风、地震和大火虽然都可能会降临，但我将一定遵循那解释我良心的细微的声音的指引。’

“说得好，额头，你的宣言将得到尊重。我已经定好了计划——我认为是正确的计划——其中我考虑了良心的要求、理智的忠告。我明白在呈上来的幸福之杯中，只要发现一块耻辱的沉渣、一丝悔恨之情，青春就会很快逝去，花朵就会立即凋零；而我不希望有牺牲、悲伤和分离——这些不合我的口味。我希望培育，不希望摧残；希望赢得感激，而不是挤出血泪——不，也不要泪水；我的收获必须是微笑、抚慰和甜蜜——这样才行。我想我是在美梦中呓语，我真想把眼前这一刻无限期地[1]延长，但我不敢。此刻，我总算控制住了自己。像心里暗暗发誓的那样表演，但是再演下去也许要经受一场非我力所能及的考验。起来，爱小姐，你走吧，戏已经演完了[2]。”

我在哪儿呢？是醒着还是睡着了？难道我一直在做梦吗？难道现在我还在梦中？这位老妇人的声音已经变了。她的口音、她的手势，一切都熟悉得像镜中我的脸——就像我自己口中说出来的话。我站起身来，但并没有走，我看了看，拨了拨炉火，再定睛看过去。但是她把帽子和绷带拉了拉，把脸遮得更严了，并且再次摆手让我走。火焰照亮了她伸出的手。这时我已清醒，一心想看个究竟，立即注意到了这只手。它和我的手一样，不是老年人干枯的手。它丰满柔软，手指光滑而匀称，一枚宽宽的戒指在小手指上闪闪发光。我俯身向前仔细观察，看到了一颗我以前见过上百次的宝石。我再次打量了那张脸，这次她没有避开我——相反，帽子摘了下来，头巾也拉了下来，头伸向了我。

“嗨，简，你认识我吗？”那熟悉的声音问。

“您只要脱下红色的斗篷，先生，那就——”

“可是这绳子打结了——帮我一下。”

“扯断它，先生。”

“好吧，那么‘脱下来，这些借来的东西！’”罗切斯特先生脱去了伪装。

“哦，先生，这是个多奇怪的主意！”

“不过干得很成功，嗯？你不这样想吗？”

“对付那些小姐，您也许做得很好。”

“但对你不行？”

“您并没对我扮演吉卜赛人的角色。”

“我演了什么角色啦？我自己吗？”

“不，一个难以捉摸的人物。总之，我相信您一直要把我的话套出来，或者把我拉进您的圈套。您一直在胡言乱语为的是让我也这样，这很难说是公平的，先生。”

“你肯原谅我吗，简？”

“我要仔细想想后才能回答。如果经过考虑我觉得自己并没有干出荒唐的事来，那我会努力原谅您的。不过您这样做是不对的。”

“哦，你刚才一直做得很对——非常谨慎，非常明智。”

我回想了一下，大体认为自己是这样。这叫人安心。不过说实在的，几乎从一见面，我就心存戒心。我怀疑有点伪装，我知道吉卜赛人和算命人并不像这个看上去像老太婆的人那样说话。此外，我还注意到了她装出来的腔调，注意到了她急于遮掩自己的面容。可是我脑子里一直想着格雷斯·普尔——那个谜中之谜，因此根本就没有想到罗切斯特先生。

“好吧，”他说，“你呆呆地在想什么呀？那严肃的笑容是什么意思？”

“惊讶和庆幸，先生。我想，现在您允许我离开了吧？”

“不，再待一会儿。告诉我那边会客室里的人在干什么？”

“我想是在议论那个吉卜赛人。”

“坐下，坐下！——讲给我听听他们说我什么啦？”

“我还是不要久待好，先生。现在快十一点了。哦，您可知道，罗切斯特先生，您早晨走后，有位陌生人到了。”

“陌生人！——不，会是谁呢？我并没有等什么人来，他走了吗？”

“没有呢，他说他和您相识很久了，可以冒昧地住下等您回来。”

“见鬼！他说了姓名吗？”

“他的名字叫梅森，先生，他是从西印度群岛来的，我想是牙买加的西班牙城。”

罗切斯特先生正站在我身旁。他拉住了我的手，仿佛要领我坐到一把椅子上。我一说出这话，他便一阵痉挛，紧紧抓住我的手，嘴上的笑容冻结了，显然一阵呼吸急促使他透不过气来。

“梅森！——西印度群岛！”他说，那口气使人想起一架会说话的机器在单调地重复着，“梅森！——西印度群岛！”他又说了一遍，把那几个字重复了三遍，这时，脸色白如死灰，几乎不知道自己在干什么。

“您不舒服吗，先生？”我问。

“简，我受到了打击——我受到了打击，简！”他身子直摇晃。

“啊！——靠在我身上，先生。”

“简，你的肩膀曾支撑过我，现在再支撑一回吧。”

“好的，先生，好的，还有我的胳膊。”

他坐了下来，让我坐在他旁边；用双手握住我的手，轻轻地抚摸着；同时用十分不安和忧伤的眼神凝视着我。

“我的小朋友，”他说，“我真希望待在一个平静的小岛上，只有你和我在一起，让那些烦恼、危险、讨厌的往事都离我们远远的。”

“我能帮助您吗，先生？——我愿用我的生命为您效劳。”

“简，如果我需要帮助的话，我会找你帮忙，我向你保证。”

“谢谢您，先生。告诉我该干些什么——至少我会尽力的。”

“简，替我从餐厅里拿杯酒来，他们都会在那里吃晚餐。告诉我梅森是不是和他们在一起，他在干什么？”

我去了。如罗切斯特先生所说，大家都在餐厅里吃晚餐。他们并没有坐在桌子跟前；晚餐摆在餐具柜上，谁想吃什么就拿什么。大家三三两两地站着，手里端着盘子和酒杯。大家看上去都兴致勃勃，谈笑风生，气氛十分活跃。梅森先生站在火炉旁，在与登特上校和登特太太交谈，看上去和别人一样愉快。我倒了一杯酒（我看见英格拉姆小姐皱着眉头在看我，肯定是认为我太放肆了），回到了图书室。

罗切斯特先生极度苍白的脸已经恢复神色，又显得坚定而严肃了。他从我手里接过酒杯。

“祝你健康，救护天使！”他说着，一口气喝下了酒，把杯子还给我，“他们在干什么呢，简？”

“谈天说地，先生。”

“他们没有像听到什么奇怪的事情那样，显得严肃和神情怪异吗？”

“一点也没有——大家都是谈笑风生。”

“梅森呢？”

“他也和他们一起说笑。”

“如果这些人都一起来唾弃我，你会怎么办呢，简？”

“把他们赶出去，先生，只要我办得到。”

他露出笑意。“如果我到他们那儿去，他们只是冷冷地看着我，还轻蔑地窃窃私语，然后便一个个撇下我走开了，那怎么办呢？你会和他们一起走吗？”

“我想我不会的，先生。和您在一起我会更愉快。”

“你会安慰我吗？”

“是的，先生，尽我的力量安慰您。”

“如果他们禁止你跟着我呢？”

“也许我根本就不会知道他们的禁令，即使知道我也根本不在乎。”

“那么说，你为了我不顾别人的责难了？”

“任何一位朋友，如果值得我守护，我会敢于面对责难的。我深信您就是一位这样的朋友。”

“现在你回到客厅去，悄悄地走到梅森身边，小声地凑近他的耳朵告诉他罗切斯特先生已经到了，希望见他。把他领到这里来，然后你就走。”

“好的，先生。”

我按他的吩咐办了，客人们都瞪着眼睛看我径直从他们中间穿过。我找到了梅森先生，告诉了他，领他走出房间。带他走进图书室，然后我走上楼去了。

深夜时分，我上床之后过了一段时间，我听见客人们才各自回房。我听出了罗切斯特先生的嗓音，听见他说：“这边走，梅森，这是你的房间。”

他高兴地说着。欢快的语气使我放下心来，我很快就睡着了。

第二十章


我忘记像平常那样拉上帐幔，窗帘也没有放下。结果，一轮皎洁的满月（因为那天夜色很好），沿着她的轨道，来到我窗户对面的天空，透过没有遮拦的窗玻璃窥视着我，她那明亮的目光把我唤醒了。夜阑人静，我睁开眼睛，看到了月亮那水晶般洁白的圆脸。它美丽却过于肃穆。我欠起身子，伸手去拉帐幔。

天哪！多么可怕的喊声！

宁寂而安静的夜晚突然被响彻桑菲尔德府的一声狂野刺耳的尖叫打破了。

我的脉搏和心脏都停止了跳动，我伸出的胳膊僵住了。喊声消失，没有再响起。的确，不管是什么东西发出了刚才那可怕的叫声，也不可能立即再叫一次，即使是安第斯山上翅膀最大的秃鹰，也不可能在它巢穴周围的云端连续两次发出这样的叫声。发出这个声音必须得喘口气才有力气再重复一遍。

这声音是从三楼传来的，因为是从我的头顶上传来的。在我的头顶——不错，就在我天花板上头的房间里——此刻我听到了一阵挣扎，听起来像是垂死的挣扎，还有一个快要窒息的声音喊道：

“救命！救命！救命！”急促地连叫了三遍。

“怎么没有人来啊？”这声音喊道。接着，在一阵发疯似的连续踉跄和跺脚中，透过地板和灰泥，我听出有人在喊：

“罗切斯特！罗切斯特，看在上帝的分上，快来呀！”

一扇房门开了。有人跑过，或者说冲过了走廊。另一个人的脚步踩在头顶的地板上，接着有什么东西跌倒了，随后便是一片沉寂。

尽管我吓得四肢发抖，但还是穿上衣服走出了房间。所有熟睡的人都被惊醒了，每个房间都响起了惊叫声和不安的低语声。一扇扇门被打开了，一个个人都探出头来。走廊上站满了人。男女宾客们都从床上爬起来。“哎呀，怎么回事？”——“谁受伤了？”——“出了什么事？”——“把灯拿来啊！”——“起火了吗？”——“是不是有窃贼？”——“我们得往哪儿逃呀？”到处都是乱哄哄的询问。若不是有月光，众人眼前会是一片漆黑。他们来回乱跑，挤成一团。有的人在哭泣，有的人跌了跤，顿时乱作一团。

“见鬼，罗切斯特在哪儿？”登特上校叫道，“他床上没有人。”

“在这儿！在这儿！”有人大声回答，“大家镇静一些，我来了。”

走廊尽头的那扇门开了，罗切斯特先生拿着蜡烛走过来。他刚从楼上下来，有一位女士就立即朝他跑过去，一把抓住他的胳膊。是英格拉姆小姐。

“出了什么可怕的事？”她说，“快说！马上把最坏的情况告诉我们！”

“别把我拖倒，也别勒死我。”他回答，因为此刻两位埃希顿小姐也紧紧抓住他不放，两位遗孀穿着宽大的白色衬衣，像鼓足了风帆的船，向他直冲过来。

“什么事儿也没有！——什么事儿也没有！”他喊道，“不过是‘无事生非’的一场彩排。女士们，让开，不然我可要生气了。”

而此时他确实目露凶光，乌黑的眼睛直冒火星。他竭力使自己镇定下来，接着说道：

“一个仆人做噩梦了，仅此而已。她是个容易激动、有点神经质的人。她把梦里见到的当成了鬼魂，或者是诸如此类的东西，吓得昏了过去。好吧，现在我得看着大家都回到自己的房间里去。因为只有整座房子都安静下来了，我们才能去照顾她。先生们，请你们给女士们做个榜样。英格拉姆小姐，我肯定你会证明自己不会被无聊的恐惧吓住的。艾米和路易莎，就像一对鸽子一样回到自己的窝里去吧，你们本来就像一对鸽子。太太们（对着两位遗孀），如果你们再在这冰冷的走廊里待下去的话，那肯定会感冒的。”

就这样，他连哄带命令，好不容易让所有的人回到了各自的房间，关上了门。我没有等他命令就悄悄地回到自己房间，就像离开房间一样没有人注意到。

不过我没有上床睡觉，反而小心地穿好了衣服。那声尖叫以后传来的响动和大声喊出来的话，很可能只有我一个人听到，因为它是从我头顶的房间传来的。但我确信，闹得整座房子一片惊恐的绝不是仆人的噩梦，罗切斯特先生的解释不过是为了让客人们安心而凭空编造的。于是我穿上衣服准备应付万一。穿好衣服之后，我眺望着静谧的庭院和银色的田野，长时间地坐在窗边，连自己也不知道在等待着什么。我似乎感到，在奇怪的喊叫、搏斗和呼救之后，肯定要发生什么事情。

但没有，一切又恢复平静了。种种低语和走动都渐渐平息下来，一小时后整座桑菲尔德府便像荒漠般沉寂了。暗夜与沉睡似乎又恢复了它们的统治。这时，月亮渐渐下沉，快要消失了。我不喜欢在一片漆黑和阴冷中坐着，觉得还是和衣躺在床上好一些。于是我离开窗口，轻手轻脚地穿过地毯，想弯腰去脱鞋，这时，忽然听到一只手谨慎地轻轻地敲响了我的门。

“需要我帮忙吗？”我问。

“你没有睡？”我盼望中的那个声音问道，那是我主人的声音。

“是的，先生。”

“穿好衣服了吗？”

“是的。”

“那么，出来吧，别出声。”

我照他说的做了。罗切斯特先生端着灯，站在走廊上。

“我需要你的帮忙，”他说，“这边走，别着急，也别出声。”

我穿的是一双很薄的拖鞋，走在铺好席子的地板上像猫一样轻柔。他悄悄顺着走廊走过去，上了楼梯，在多事的三楼幽暗低矮的走廊上停住了脚步，我跟着他，在他旁边停了下来。

“你房间里有海绵吗？”他低声说。

“有，先生。”

“有没有盐——容易挥发的那种盐？”

“有。”

“回去把这两样东西都拿来。”

我回到房间，在脸盆架上找到了海绵，从抽屉里找到了盐，然后再顺原路返回。他还在等我，手里拿了把钥匙。走到那些黑色小门中的一扇，把钥匙插进锁孔，又停下来，对我说：

“见到血你不会昏倒吧？”

“我想不会吧，不过我从来没有试过。”

我回答时不觉感到毛骨悚然，但没感到冷，也没有头晕。

“把手伸给我，”他说，“可不能冒让你昏倒的危险。”

我把手指放在他手里。“温暖而沉着。”他给了我这样的评价。他转动钥匙，开了门。

我看见了一个似曾见过的房间，记得就在费尔法克斯太太带我参观整幢房子的那一天。那时房间里挂着的帷幔现在有一部分已经卷了起来，露出了一扇门。门敞开着，里面有亮光透出来。那里传出来又叫又抓的声音，和狗叫差不多。罗切斯特先生放下蜡烛，对我说“等一下”，便向里屋走去。他一进去迎接他的就是一阵狂笑，后来以格雷斯·普尔妖怪般的哈哈声而告终。她就在那儿，他默不做声地不知作了些什么安排，不过我还听到有人低声地跟他说话。他走了出来，随手关了门。

“到这儿来，简！”他说。我绕到了一张大床的另外一头，这张拉上了帷幔的床占去了大半个房间。床头边有把安乐椅，椅子上坐了个人，他穿得很整齐，只是没有穿外套。他一动不动，头往后靠着，双眼紧闭。罗切斯特先生把蜡烛举起来照着他。从苍白没有血色的脸上，我认出了是那个陌生人梅森。我还看到，他衬衣的一边和一只胳膊几乎全浸在鲜血里。

“拿着蜡烛。”罗切斯特先生说，我接过了蜡烛。他从脸盆架上端来了一盆水，“端着它。”他说。我照办了。他拿了海绵，在脸盆里浸了一下，用它湿润了那张像死尸般的脸。他向我要了嗅盐瓶，把它放在梅森的鼻子底下。不一会儿梅森先生睁开眼睛，开始呻吟起来。罗切斯特先生解开他的衬衫，露出了包扎绷带的胳膊和肩膀。他用海绵把迅速往下淌的鲜血吸去。

“有生命危险吗？”梅森先生喃喃地说。

“呸！不会——不过划破了一点皮。别那么消沉，伙计。打起精神来！现在我去给你请医生，希望明天一早可以把你送走。简——”他回头对我说。

“先生？”

“我得把你留下来陪这位先生待上一小时，也许两小时。如果又有血流出来，你就像我那样用海绵把它吸掉。如果他感到头昏，你就把架子上的那杯水端到他嘴边，让他闻一闻嗅盐。无论如何不要跟他说话——而——理查德——如果你跟她说话，你就会有生命危险，譬如说张开嘴——让自己激动起来——那我可不对后果负责了。”

这个可怜的人又呻吟起来。他看上去好像不敢轻举妄动，也不知道是怕死还是害怕别的什么东西，好像弄得他几乎全身瘫痪了。罗切斯特先生把那块已浸染了血的海绵放到我手里，我就开始像他那样做起来。他看了我一会儿，说了句：“记住！——别说话！”便离开了房间。钥匙在锁孔里咔嗒一下，他逐渐远去的脚步声再也听不到时，我有了一种奇怪的感觉。

如今，我在三楼上，被锁进了一个神秘的小屋里。周围是黑夜，眼前和手下是一幕苍白的血淋淋的场景。一个杀人的女凶手与我只有一门之隔。是的——那令人胆战心惊——其余的倒还可以忍受，可我一想到格雷斯·普尔会向我扑来，便吓得浑身直打哆嗦了。

尽管这样，我还得坚守岗位。我得看着这副死人般的面孔——这张不准说话的僵硬发青的嘴——一双一会儿闭上，一会儿张开，一会儿又朝屋里四处张望，一会儿又盯住我，被吓得总是呆滞无光的眼睛。我必须把手一次次地深入那盆血水里，擦去淌下的鲜血，我必须在忙碌中眼看着没有剪过烛芯的烛光渐渐暗淡下去，它照出的阴影落在我周围精致古老的挂毯上，在陈旧的大床的帷幔下变得越来越浓重，还在对面一个大柜的门上古怪地晃动着——柜子的正面分成十二块嵌板，嵌板上画着十二使徒的头，面目狰狞，每块嵌板上像画框似的镶着一个头像，而在它们的最上面，悬挂着一个乌木十字架和垂死的基督。

游移的暗影和闪烁的光芒在四处浮动和跳跃，我一会儿看到了留胡子的医生低垂着头；一会儿看到了圣约翰的长发在飘动；不久又看到了嵌板上突现出来的犹大魔鬼似的面孔，似乎渐渐活了过来，很快就要以最大的背叛者撒旦的化身出现。

在这种情形下，我不但要注意观察还要仔细倾听，倾听那边洞穴里那头野兽或恶魔的动静。可是自从罗切斯特先生来过之后，它似乎被魔法镇住了。整整一夜我只听见过三声响动，而且间隔很长——一次悄悄的脚步声，一次重又短暂发作的狗嗥似的声音，一次是人的深沉的呻吟声。

此外，我自己也焦虑不安。究竟是一种什么罪行，以人的化身出现，蛰居在这座与世隔绝的大宅里，而宅子的主人既无法驱赶也难以制服？究竟是什么不可思议的东西，在夜深人静时，弄得一会儿起火，一会儿流血？究竟是什么，以普通女人的面貌和体态伪装自己，发出时而像嘲弄人的魔鬼的笑声，时而像寻觅腐尸的猛禽的声音？

我俯身照料的这个人——这个普普通通、安安静静的陌生人——他是怎么被卷入这个恐怖的网中的呢？为什么复仇之神要扑向他呢？本该在床上睡觉的他，又是出于什么原因不合时宜地到宅子的这个房间里来呢？我曾听罗切斯特先生在楼下指定了一个房间给他——是什么东西把他带到这儿来的呢？而且为什么他对加在他身上的暴行或者暗算，却这样逆来顺受呢？为什么他对罗切斯特先生强迫掩盖真相，竟默默地顺从？为什么罗切斯特先生非要掩盖事实真相呢？这次，罗切斯特先生的一位客人受到了伤害，上次他自己也遭到了恶毒的谋害，而这两件事他竟都悄悄地掩盖、隐瞒起来！最后，我看到梅森先生对罗切斯特一副顺从的样子，罗切斯特先生的专断个性完全支配着梅森先生顺从的个性。他们之间寥寥数语就使我确信不疑。显然在他们以往的交谈中，一位的消极脾性惯于受另一位的主动精神的影响，既然如此，那么罗切斯特先生一听梅森先生到了，为什么会如此沮丧呢？为什么几小时之前罗切斯特先生仅仅听到了这个不速之客的名字——罗切斯特先生的话足以使他像孩子般服服帖帖的——居然就像一棵橡树遭到了雷击一样？

哎，当他向我低声耳语“简，我受到了打击——我受到了打击，简”时，我忘不了他的表情和苍白的脸色，也忘不了他的胳膊靠在我肩上时颤抖得多厉害。能征服费尔法克斯·罗切斯特坚毅的精神，使他强健的身躯颤抖的，决不是什么小事情。

“他什么时候回来？他什么时候回来？”我心里大声呼喊着，漫漫黑夜——我这位流着血的病人已身体虚弱，又是呻吟，又是发晕。而白昼和支援迟迟未到，我已经一次次把水端到梅森苍白的嘴边，一次次把刺激性的嗅盐给他闻。我的努力似乎并没有奏效，肉体上的痛苦，或者精神上的悲伤，或者是失血，或者三者兼而有之，使他的精力衰竭了。他一直呻吟着，看上去那么衰弱、狂乱和绝望，我担心他要死了，而我却连话也不能和他说。

蜡烛终于燃尽了，熄灭了。这时，我看到窗帘边缘透出一缕缕灰色的微光，黎明正渐渐到来。不一会儿，我听到派洛特在下面院子里远远的狗窝外的叫声。总算有了希望。这不是没有根据的，五分钟后，钥匙咔嗒一响，锁打开了，这预示着我的守护工作结束了。总共才两个小时，但似乎比几个星期还要长。

罗切斯特先生进来了，还有他请来的外科医生。

“喂，卡特，你得注意，”他对来人说，“我只给你半个小时，包扎伤口、捆绑绷带，把病人送到楼下，全都包括在内。”

“不过他适宜走动吗，先生？”

“没有问题。伤势并不严重，就是心里紧张，必须让他打起精神来。来，动手吧。”

罗切斯特先生拉开厚厚的窗幔，掀起亚麻布窗帘，尽量让光照进屋来。看到黎明即将来临，一道道玫瑰色的霞光照亮东方的天际，我真是又惊又喜！接着，罗切斯特先生走近梅森，这时外科医生已经在给他治疗了。

“喂，我的好伙计，怎么样？”他问道。

“恐怕我要死在她的手里了。”对方微弱地回答。

“不会的！——勇敢点！再过两周你就没事了，只不过是流了点血。卡特，让他放心，他不会有危险的。”

“我可以凭良心这么说。”卡特说，他已经打开了绷带，“如果早来一会儿就好了，他就不会流那么多血了——这是怎么回事？怎么肩膀上的肉像刀割似的裂开了？这不是刀伤，是牙齿咬的。”

“她咬了我，”他咕哝着，“罗切斯特把刀从她手里夺走的时候，她就像一只母老虎似的对我又撕又咬。”

“你不该退让，应该马上抓住她。”罗切斯特先生说。

“可是在那种情况下，你能怎么办？”梅森回答道，“哦，太可怕了！”他浑身颤抖说，“我都没有想到，开始她看上去那么平静。”

“我警告过你，”他的朋友回答，“我说——你在接近她时一定要小心。而且，你真应该等到明天，让我和你一起去。你今天晚上就一个人去见她，真是够愚蠢的。”

“我想我可以做点好事。”

“你想！你想！真是的，听你这么说真让我不耐烦。不过，你毕竟是吃了苦头，不听我劝告你会吃够苦头，所以我不想再说了。卡特，快点！快点！太阳马上要出来了，我必须让他离开。”

“马上好，先生。肩膀已经包扎好了。我得处理一下胳膊上的另一个伤口。我想这儿也被咬了。”

“她吸了血，她还说要把我心里的血也吸干。”梅森说。

我看见罗切斯特先生打了个冷战，一种极其明显的厌恶、恐惧和憎恨的表情，几乎使他的脸扭曲得变了形。可是他只是说：

“好了，别说了，理查德，别管她的胡说八道了。别再提了。”

“但愿我能忘掉。”对方回答。

“你一出这个国家就会忘掉。等你回到了西班牙城，你就当她已经死了，埋了——或者根本就不必去想她。”

“怎么也忘不了今天晚上！”

“不会忘不了，老兄，打起精神来吧。两小时之前你还说你像条死鱼那样快没命了，可现在你还不是活得好好地在说话。瞧！——卡特已经给你包扎好啦，或者差不多好了。一会儿我就让你打扮得整整齐齐。简（他回来以后还是第一次和我说话），拿着这把钥匙，下楼到我的卧室去，一直走进更衣室，打开衣柜顶端的抽屉，取件干净的衬衫和一条围巾，拿到这里来，动作要快。”

我去了，找到了他说的衣柜，翻出了他要的东西，拿了回来。

“好啦，”他说，“我要给他换衣服了，你到床那边去，不过别离开房间，也许还需要你。”

我按他的吩咐退到一旁。

“你下楼的时候有人在吗，简？”罗切斯特先生立刻问。

“没有，先生，什么动静也没有。”

“我们得小心地把你送走，迪克。这对你自己，对那边那个可怜的家伙都比较好。一直以来我都竭力地隐瞒，想不到最后还是泄露出去了。来，卡特，帮他穿上背心。你的皮斗篷放在哪儿了？我知道，在这种见鬼的冷天气里，没有斗篷，连一英里都走不了。在你房间里吗？——简，下楼到梅森先生的房间去——在我的隔壁——把你看到的斗篷拿来。”

我又赶快跑着去，又跑着回来，拿来一件毛皮镶边的大斗篷。

“现在，我还有一件事情需要你，”我那不知疲倦的主人说，“你得再去我房间一趟。幸亏你穿的是丝绒鞋，简！——在这种时候，粗手笨脚的人可不行。你得打开我梳妆台的中间抽屉，把你看到的一个小瓶子和一个小杯拿来——快！”

我又飞奔着跑去跑回来，拿来了他要的药瓶和杯子。

“太好了！现在，医生，我要擅自用药了，我自己负责。这瓶兴奋剂，我是从罗马一位意大利庸医那儿搞来的——那个家伙，你肯定会一脚把他踢开的。卡特，这东西不能随便乱用，但偶尔用用还挺有效，譬如说现在。简，拿点水来。”

他递过那小玻璃杯，我从脸盆架上拿起水瓶，倒了半杯水。

“够了——现在用水把瓶口沾湿。”

我这么做了。他滴了十二滴深红色液体，递给梅森。

“喝吧，理查德，它会把你所缺乏的勇气鼓起来，能维持一小时左右。”

“可是对身体有害吗？——有没有刺激性？”

“喝吧！喝吧！喝吧！”

梅森先生服从了，显然抗拒也无济于事。这时他已穿戴整齐，看上去仍很苍白，但已不再浑身血污了。罗切斯特先生让他在喝了那液体后，又坐了三分钟，然后扶住他的胳膊：

“我相信你能站起来了，”他说，“试试看。”

病人站了起来。

“卡特，扶住他的另一个肩膀。理查德，振作起来，往前跨一步——好！”

“我确实感觉好多了。”梅森先生说。

“我相信你是这样。嗨，简，你先走，在我们前面带路，到后楼梯去把边门的门闩拉开，告诉在院子里能看到的驿车车夫——也许车子就在院子外面，因为我告诉他别在石子道上驾车，弄得轮子嘎吱直响——让他准备好，我们就来了。还有，简，如果附近有人，你就走到楼梯下咳嗽一声。”

这时已是五点半，太阳就要升起。不过我发觉厨房里依然漆黑一片，没有声音。边门还锁着，我尽量悄悄把它打开。院子里静悄悄的。但院门敞开着，有辆驿车停在外面，马匹都套了马具，车夫坐在车座上。我走过去，告诉他先生们就要来了。他点了点头。接着我小心地四处张望，仔细听着。清晨，一切都在沉睡，处处一片宁静。仆人房间里的门窗都还拉着窗帘，小鸟在白花满枝的果树上唱歌，树枝像白色的花环那样低垂着，从院子一边的围墙探出头来。拉车用的马在关着的马厩里不时蹬几下蹄子，此外便没有任何声音了。

这时先生们到了。梅森由罗切斯特先生和医生扶着，步子似乎还算平稳，他们搀着他上了车，卡特也跟着上去了。

“小心照顾他，”罗切斯特先生对卡特说，“在他身体恢复之前，让他待在你家里。过一两天我会骑马过去探望他的。理查德，你怎么样了？”

“新鲜空气让我精神好多了，费尔法克斯。”

“让他那边的窗子开着，卡特，没有风——再见，迪克。”

“费尔法克斯——”

“噢，什么事？”

“照顾照顾她吧，待她尽量温柔些，让她——”他哭了起来，说不下去了。

“我会尽力的。我已经这么做了，将来也会这么做的。”他答道，关上了驿车的门，车子开走了。

“上帝保佑，这一切总得有个了结！”罗切斯特先生一面说，一面把沉重的院门关上，闩好。然后，他步履迟缓，精神恍惚地走向果园旁边的墙门。我想他已经不再需要我了，准备回房间。可是又听见他叫了声：“简！”他已经打开了门，站在门口等我。

“来，到空气新鲜的地方待一会儿吧，”他说，“这所房子简直是座监狱，你不这样觉得吗？”

“依我看，这是一座很漂亮的宅子，先生。”

“天真无知的魔力蒙住了你的眼睛，”他回答说，“你是用被施了魔法的眼光来看它的；你看不出镀的金是黏土，丝绸帐幔是蛛网，大理石是肮脏的石板，上光的木器不过是废木屑和烂树皮。而这里（他指着我们踏进的树叶繁茂的院落）一切都是真实、可爱、纯洁的。”

他信步沿着一条小径走去，小径一旁种着黄杨木、苹果树、梨树和樱桃树；另一边是花坛，长满了各色常见的花，有：紫罗兰、美洲石竹、报春花、三色堇，混杂着青蒿、多花蔷薇和各色香草。四月里持续不断晴雨交替的天气之后，迎来了一个春光明媚的早晨，这些花草都格外鲜艳。太阳光穿过光影斑驳的东方，照耀着花满枝头露水晶莹的果树，洒落在树下静静的小径上。

“简，给你一朵花好吗？”

他摘了枝头上蓓蕾初开的玫瑰，送给了我。

“谢谢，先生。”

“你喜欢日出吗，简？喜欢天空，喜欢那高高的天空上一暖和就消失的轻云吗？——喜欢这宁静而温馨的气氛吗？”

“喜欢，很喜欢。”

“你度过了一个奇特的夜晚，简。”

“是的，先生。”

“你的脸色都变苍白了，把你一个人留在梅森身边，你怕吗？”

“我怕有人会从里屋出来。”

“可是我锁上了门——钥匙在我口袋里。如果我把一只羊羔——我心爱的小羊——毫无保护地留在狼窝边，那我岂不是一个粗心大意的牧羊人了？你很安全。”

“格雷斯·普尔还会住在这儿吗，先生？”

“哦，是的，别为她伤脑筋了——忘掉这件事儿吧。”

“我总觉得只要她在，您就不得安宁。”

“别怕——我自己会小心的。”

“您昨晚担心的危险，现在是否已经过去了呢，先生？”

“在梅森离开英格兰之前，我还不敢肯定。甚至他离开了也不敢。活着对我来说，简，好像是站在火山口上，不知道哪天它就会裂开，喷出火来。”

“可是梅森先生好像很顺从，先生，您显然能影响他，他绝不会和您作对，或者故意伤害您。”

“呵，不错！梅森是不会跟我作对，也不会故意来伤害我——不过，他可能会无意间失言，即使不会剥夺我的生命，也会剥夺我一生的幸福。”

“叫他小心，先生，让他知道您的忧虑，告诉他怎样避开危险。”

他嘲讽地哈哈大笑起来，一下子抓住我的手，一下子又把它甩掉了。

“如果我能那样做，傻瓜，那还有什么危险，转眼就可以消除了。自我认识梅森以来，我只要对他说‘那么做’，他就会那么办。不过在这件事情上我可不能对他发号施令，我无法对他说‘当心不要伤害我，理查德’，因为我绝不能让他知道他可以伤害到我，现在你似乎迷惑不解，我还会让你更迷惑不解呢。你是我的小朋友，对吗？”

“我很高兴为您效劳，先生，只要是对的，我都服从您。”

“确实如此，我看你是这么做的。你帮助我，使我愉快——为我忙碌，也与我一起忙碌，干你特别强调的‘只要是对的’事情时，我从你的步履和神采，你的目光和表情上，看到了一种真诚的满足。因为如果我吩咐你去做你心目中的错事，那就不会有步态轻盈的奔忙，干脆利落的敏捷，也不会有活泼的眼神和兴奋的脸色了。我的朋友会神态恬静面容苍白地转向我说：‘不，先生，那不可能，我不能干，因为那是不对的。’你会像一颗恒星那样不可动摇。噢，你也能左右我，还可以伤害我，不过我不敢把我的弱点告诉你，因为尽管你既忠实又友好，也会马上给我致命一击的。”

“如果您对梅森的惧怕还没超过对我的惧怕，那您就是安全的。”

“上帝保佑，但愿如此！来，简，这里有个凉棚，坐下吧。”

凉棚是搭在围墙上的一个拱顶，上面爬满了藤蔓。棚下有一条粗木长凳，罗切斯特先生坐了下来，还留出了地方让我坐。不过我还是站在他面前。

“坐下吧，”他说，“这条长凳够两个人坐的，你不会是为要不要坐在我旁边而犹豫不决吧？这难道是不对的吗，简？”

我以行动回答了他，坐了下来。我觉得拒绝他是不明智的。

“好吧，我的小朋友，当太阳吸吮着雨露——这个古老的花园里的花苏醒开放时，鸟儿飞越桑菲尔德为雏鸟送来早餐，早起的蜜蜂开始了它们第一阵忙碌时——我要把这件事诉说给你听，你必须要努力把它设想成自己的。不过先看着我，告诉我你很平静，并不担心我把你留下，或者你留下来是不对的。”

“不，先生，我很愿意。”

“那么好吧，简，发挥你的想象力吧——设想你不再是受过精心培养和教导的姑娘，而是一个从小就放纵任性的男孩。设想你身处遥远的异国，假设你在那里铸成了大错，不管其性质如何，出于什么动机，它的后果将伴随你一生，玷污了你整个生活。注意，我没有说犯罪，不是说流血或是其他犯罪行为，那样的犯罪者会被绳之以法，我用的词是错误。你做下的那件事的后果最后让你感到无法忍受。你采取了种种措施以求获得解脱，那些非正常的措施，但既不违法，也并非有罪。但你仍然感到痛苦，因为你刚进入生活的边缘，希望却离你而去，你的太阳遇上日食，在正午就开始暗淡，你觉得不到日落不会有所改变。痛苦和令人耻辱的回想，成了你记忆的唯一食粮。你四处漂泊，在放逐生活中寻求安宁，在寻欢作乐中寻觅幸福——我指的是那种没有感情的肉欲——它销蚀才智，摧残情感。在几年的自愿放逐以后，你心力交瘁，灵魂麻木地回到了家里，结识了一位新知——何时结识、如何结识，都无关紧要。在这位陌生人身上，你发现了二十多年苦苦寻找却始终没有遇到的优异品质。这些品质清新、健康，没有丝毫的尘埃或污点，这种交往使你振作，重获新生。你觉得美好的生活回来了——又有了更高的期望和更纯洁的感情。你渴望重新开始生活，以一种更配得上不朽灵魂的方式度过余生。为了达到这个目的，你是不是有理由越过习俗的藩篱——那种既没有得到你良心的认可，也不为你的见识所赞同的纯粹世俗的障碍？”

他停了一下等我回答，而我该说什么呢？哦，但愿有一位善良的精灵能给我提示一个明智而满意的答复！但这只是徒然的愿望！西风在我周围的藤蔓中耳语，可就是没有一位温柔的爱丽儿[1]借助风声给我提示。鸟儿在树梢歌唱，它们的歌声虽然甜美，却无法让人理解。

罗切斯特先生再次提出了他的问题：

“这个一度四处流浪、罪孽深重、现在思安悔过的人，是不是有理由无视世俗的偏见，让这位温柔、文雅、和蔼可亲的陌生人和他永远在一起，以获得内心的宁静和生命的复苏呢？”

“先生，”我回答，“一个流浪者要安顿下来，或者一个罪人要改过自新，不应当依赖他的同类。无论男人和女人都难免一死；哲学家们会在智慧面前踌躇，基督徒会在德行面前犹豫。如果你知道有人曾因犯了错误而痛苦，就让他从高于他的同类那儿去寻求改过自新的力量，寻求安慰来治愈创伤吧。”

“可是途径呢——途径，即使上帝做这件事，也得有途径啊。我自己——直截了当地告诉你吧——曾经是个庸俗、放荡、焦躁的人，现在我相信自己找到了救治的途径，那就是——”

他停住了。鸟儿继续唱歌，树叶仍沙沙作响。我几乎感到奇怪，它们为什么不停止歌唱和低语，倾听这暂时中断的自白。不过它们得等好几分钟——这沉默持续了好久。我终于抬头去看这位说话吞吞吐吐的人，他也急切地看着我。

“小朋友，”他说，完全改了口气——脸上的表情也变了，失去了所有的温柔和庄重，变得粗暴而嘲弄——“你注意到了我对英格拉姆小姐的柔情吧，你认为，如果我娶了她，会使我彻底新生吗？”

他猛地站了起来，几乎走到了小径的另一头，走回来时嘴里哼着曲子。

“简，简，”他说着在我跟前站住了，“你守了一夜，脸色都发白了，你不怪我打扰了你的休息吗？”

“责怪你？不，先生。”

“让我们握手为证。多冷的手啊！昨晚在那间神秘的卧室门外相遇时，比现在要暖和得多。简，什么时候你再和我一起守夜呢？”

“凡是用得着我的时候，先生。”

“比如说，我结婚的前一夜。我肯定会睡不着。你答应陪我一起守夜吗？我可以和你谈我心爱的人，因为现在你已经见过她，认识她了。”

“是的，先生。”

“她是一个不可多得的人，是不是，简？”

“是的，先生。”

“一个体魄强壮的女人——十足的强壮女人，简。高高的个子，褐色的皮肤，丰满的胸部，迦太基女人大概会有的头发。天哪！登特和林恩在那边的马厩里了！穿过灌木，从小门进去。”

我走了一条路，他走了另一条。只听见他在院子里愉快地说：

“梅森今天早晨比谁起得都早。还没等太阳出来他就走了，我四点钟就起来给他送行的。”

[1]爱丽儿，西方中世纪传说中的空气精灵。





第二十一章


预感真是奇怪的东西！感应和征兆也是如此。而三者相结合构成了人类至今还未解开的谜。我平生从未嘲笑过预感，因为我自己也有过这种奇怪的经历。我相信心灵感应是存在的（例如在相隔遥远、久不往来、完全生疏的亲戚之间，尽管彼此疏远，但他们归根结底，还是同出一源）。心灵感应究竟如何产生，不是人类所能理解的。而征兆，也许只是自然与人的感应，不过我对此几乎一无所知。

我还只是一个六岁的小女孩时，一天夜里听见贝茜·利文对马撒·艾博特说，她梦见了一个小孩，而梦见孩子无论对自己还是对亲人，肯定是不祥之兆。如果不是紧接着发生的一件事给我留下了深刻的印象，这种说法我也许早就淡忘了。第二天，贝茜被叫回家去看望她垂危的小妹妹。

最近我常常想起这种说法还有这件事情。因为上个星期，我几乎每晚睡觉时都会梦见一个婴儿。有时是抱在怀里哄它安静下来；有时是放在膝头抚摸它；有时看着它在草地上玩着雏菊，或者伸手在水中玩水。一晚是一个哭着的孩子，另一晚是一个笑着的孩子；一会儿它紧紧依偎着我，一会儿又逃得远远的。但是不管这个小精灵心情怎样，长相如何，一连七夜只要我一进入梦乡，它肯定会来迎接我。

我不喜欢同一念头反复不去——不喜欢同一形象奇怪地一再出现。在将要上床和幻象就要出现的时刻，我紧张不安起来。在那个夜里，我又和那个梦中的婴儿在一起，直到听到叫声惊醒过来。第二天下午，有人告诉我，让我到楼下去，有人在费尔法克斯太太房间里等着要见我。我到了那里，只见一个看上去像绅士的仆人在那儿等我，他身上穿着丧服，手中拿着的帽子上缠着黑纱。

“恐怕您已经不记得我了，小姐，”我进去，他站了起来说，“我叫利文，八九年前你在盖茨黑德的时候，我在那里给里德太太当车夫。现在我还住在那儿。”

“哦，罗伯特！你好吗？我完全记得你，有时候你还让我骑一骑乔治亚娜小姐的栗色小马呢。贝茜怎么样？你不是和她结婚了吗？”

“是的，小姐，我老婆身体很好，谢谢您。两个月之前她又给我生了个小家伙——现在我们有三个了——大人和孩子都挺好。”

“盖茨黑德府的人都好吗，罗伯特？”

“我很抱歉不能给你带来好消息，小姐。现在他们都很糟——非常糟糕。”

“但愿不是有人去世了。”我看了一眼他黑色的丧服说。他也低头看了一下缠在帽上的黑纱，说：

“约翰先生一周以前在他伦敦的住所去世了。”

“约翰先生？”

“是。”

“他母亲怎么能受得了呢？”

“哎，你知道，爱小姐，这可不是一般的不幸事。他的生活非常放荡，最近三年他更是荒唐得出奇，他死得也让人难以接受。”

“我听贝茜说，他干得不太好。”

“干得不太好？简直是不能再坏了，他在一批坏男女中厮混，弄坏了身体，花光了家产。他负债累累，进了监狱。他母亲两次把他弄出来，但他一出来就回到他的老熟人那儿，恢复了旧习惯。他的脑子不大好使，那些和他在一起的无赖，用我听都没听说过的各种手段来欺骗他。三个星期之前，他到盖茨黑德府，让太太把全部家产都给他，被太太拒绝了，因为她的财产早已被他挥霍得所剩不多了。所以他只好返回，接着就传来他死的消息。天知道他是怎么死的！——据说他是自杀的。”

我沉默了，这消息太可怕了。罗伯特·利文继续说：

“太太自己的身体也不好，这已经有好长一段时间了。身体发胖，但并不强壮。她丢了钱，又怕受穷，这几乎使她完全垮了。约翰先生的死讯和他的这种死法对她来说太突然了，让她中风了。她三天都没有说话。不过上个星期二似乎好些了，仿佛想说什么，不停地向我妻子做着手势，嘴里还叽里咕噜的。不过昨天早上贝茜弄明白了，她叫的是您的名字。最后总算听清了她的话：‘把简带来——去把简·爱叫来，我有话要和她说。’贝茜不敢肯定她的神志是否清醒，这些话是不是认真的。但是她还是告诉了里德小姐和乔治亚娜小姐，向她们建议把您叫来。起初两位年轻小姐置之不理，但她们的母亲越来越焦躁不安，不停地叫着‘简，简’，最后她们总算同意了。昨天我从盖茨黑德府出发。小姐，如果来得及准备的话，我想明天一早让您和我一起回去。”

“好的，罗伯特，我会准备好的，看来我还是应该回去一趟。”

“我也是这么想的，小姐。贝茜说她肯定您不会拒绝。不过我想，您得先请个假才能离开吧。”

“对，我现在就去请假。”我把他带到了仆人室，将他交给约翰的妻子照应，并请约翰亲自关照后，然后去找罗切斯特先生了。

我在楼下的房间里都没有找到他，也不在院子、马厩或者庭院里。我问费尔法克斯太太有没有见到过他——是的，她想他是在和英格拉姆小姐玩台球。我急忙赶到台球房，那儿传来了台球的撞击声和说话声。罗切斯特先生、英格拉姆小姐、两位埃希顿小姐和她们的倾慕者们正玩得起劲。要去打断这些兴致正高的人是需要一些勇气的，但我的事儿又不容拖延。于是我便向我的主人走去，他正站在英格拉姆小姐的旁边。我走近的时候，她回过头来盛气凌人地看着我，眼神似乎在说：“那个偷偷溜进来的家伙要干什么？”听到我轻轻地叫了声“罗切斯特先生”，她的手动了一下，仿佛要命令我走开。我还记得她那时的样子——优雅动人。她穿着一件天蓝色的丝绸衬衣，头发上系着一条青色薄纱头巾。她玩得正起劲，虽然此刻自尊心受到了触犯，但脸上傲慢的表情丝毫没有缓和。

“那个人是找你吗？”她问罗切斯特先生。罗切斯特先生回头看看“那个人”是谁，做了一个古怪的鬼脸——这是他的奇特而含糊的表情之一——扔下球拍，跟我走出了房门。

“怎么啦，简？”他关了房门，身子倚在门上问。

“对不起，先生，我想请一两周假。”

“干什么？——你要去哪儿？”

“去看一位生病的太太，是她派人来叫我的。”

“什么生病的太太？——她住在哪儿？”

“盖茨黑德府，在××郡。”

“××郡？离这儿有一百英里远！这么远叫你回去看她，这人是谁呀？”

“先生，她姓里德——里德太太。”

“盖茨黑德的里德？盖茨黑德府是有一个叫里德的，一个地方行政官。”

“我说的是他的遗孀，先生。”

“那你和她有什么关系？你怎么会认识她呢？”

“里德先生是我的舅舅——我母亲的哥哥。”

“见鬼，他是你的舅舅！你从来没有跟我说起过他，你一直说你没有亲戚。”

“没有一个亲戚肯认我，先生。里德先生去世了，他的太太把我赶出来了。”

“为什么？”

“因为我穷，是个累赘，她不喜欢我。”

“可是里德也有孩子吧？——你一定有表兄妹了？昨天乔治·林恩爵士还提到盖茨黑德府一个姓里德的人——他说那个人是城里一个十足的无赖，英格拉姆也提到过那儿有一个叫乔治亚娜·里德的，由于长得很漂亮，一两个社交季节之前，在伦敦很受赞赏。”

“约翰·里德也死了，先生，他毁了自己，也几乎毁了他的家，据说他是自杀的。这消息让他的母亲大受打击，结果中风了。”

“可你去了对她有什么好处呢？真荒唐，简！如果是我，我才不会想跑一百英里去看一个老太太呢，也许还没等你赶到她就死了呢。而且，你刚才还说是她把你赶出来了呢。”

“是的，先生，但那已经是很久以前的事了，那时她的境况也很不相同。现在如果我不考虑她的心愿，我会不安心的。”

“你要待多长时间？”

“尽可能短，先生。”

“答应我只待一个星期——”

“我最好还是别许下诺言，也许我会不得不食言。”

“无论如何你都要回来，你不会被她找到什么借口说服，和她长期住下去吧？”

“哦，不会的！只要一切顺利，我肯定会回来的。”

“谁和你一起去呢？你总不至于一个人赶一百英里路吧？”

“不，先生，她派了一个马车夫来。”

“这人可靠吗？”

“是的，先生，他已经在里德家待了十年。”

罗切斯特先生沉思了一会儿。“你打算什么时候走？”

“明天一早，先生。”

“嗯，你身上得带上一些钱，出门没有钱可不行。我想你钱不多。我还没有付你工资呢。你一共还有多少钱，简？”他笑着问。

我掏出钱包，里面瘪瘪的。“五先令，先生。”他拿起钱包，把里面的钱全倒在手心里，看着它咯咯笑了起来，仿佛是看到钱少而高兴似的。他立刻拿出了自己的皮夹子，“给你。”他说着递给我一张钞票，是一张五十英镑的钞票，而他只欠我十五英镑。我告诉他我找不开。

“我不要你找，你知道的。拿着你的工资吧。”

我拒绝接受超过我应得的钱。他先是沉下了脸，接着又像是想起了什么似的说：

“好吧，好吧，现在还是不要都给你的好。如果你有五十镑，也许就会待上三个月。十英镑，够吗？”

“够啦，先生，不过现在您欠我五英镑了。”

“那就回来拿吧，你还有四十英镑存在我这儿。”

“罗切斯特先生，我还是趁这个机会向您提一下我工作的事情吧。”

“你的工作？我很想听听。”

“您实际上已经告诉我了，先生，您很快就要结婚了。”

“是的，然后呢？”

“如果那样的话，先生，阿德拉该去上学了，我想您肯定也意识到了这样做的必要性。”

“别让她妨碍到我的新娘，否则她会更加看不起她。毫无疑问，你的建议非常有道理。像你说的，阿德拉必须去上学，而你，当然，得去见——魔鬼？”

“希望不是这样，先生。不过我得到别的地方再去找份工作。”

“当然！”他带着鼻音大声说道，面部抽搐了一下，表情既古怪又可笑。他看了我几分钟。

“我猜，你会去求里德太太，或者她的女儿，也就是那些小姐们给你找份工作，是吧？”

“不，先生，我跟亲戚们的关系可没那么好——不过我可以登广告。”

“你还可以大步跨上埃及金字塔！”他咆哮着，“你冒险登广告！但愿我刚才只给了你一镑，而不是十镑。还给我九镑，简，我要用。”

“我也要用，先生，”我一边回答，一边双手抓住钱包藏到了背后，“这钱我无论如何不能给。”

“小气鬼！”他说，“向你要点儿钱你都不给！给我五镑，简。”

“五镑也不给，先生，连五便士也不给。”

“让我看一看你的钱吧。”

“不，先生，我不能相信你。”

“简！”

“先生？”

“答应我一件事。”

“只要我能办得到，先生，我都答应你。”

“不要去登广告，你就把找工作的事交给我吧，到时候我会给你找一个职位。”

“我很乐意这么做，先生。只要你答应我，在你的新娘进门之前，让我和阿德拉平安地离开这儿。”

“好！很好！我答应你。你明天就走了？”

“是的，先生，一大早。”

“晚饭后你到客厅来吗？”

“不了，先生，我还得收拾行李。”

“那你我就暂时告别了？”

“我想是这样，先生。”

“人们都用什么样的仪式来告别呢，简？教一教我吧，对这些我不太清楚。”

“他们说：再见，或者是他们喜爱的其他的方式。”

“那就这么说吧。”

“再见，罗切斯特先生，暂时再见了。”

“我该怎么说呢？”

“一样的，如果您愿意，先生。”

“再见了，简·爱，暂时再见了。就是这些吗？”

“是的。”

“在我看来，这样似乎太吝啬了，干巴巴的，不友好。我还想要点别的，一点礼仪之外的东西。比如，握握手，不——那也不能使我满意。那么除了一声‘再见’，你不想再做些什么了吗，简？”

“这就够了，先生，一句出于真心的话所表达出来的好意，胜过千言万语。”

“很可能，但这既空洞又冷淡——‘再见’。”

“他背靠着门，打算站多久啊？”我心里想，“我得收拾行李了。”晚餐铃响了，他一句话也没有再说，突然跑开了。那天我没有再见到他，第二天早晨，他还没起床我就动身了。

五月一日下午五点左右，我到了盖茨黑德府门房。在进宅子之前我先去那儿看看。里面十分整洁，装饰性的窗户上挂着白色的小窗帘，地上一点儿污渍也没有，炉栅和炉具都擦得锃亮，炉火明亮地燃烧着。贝茜坐在炉边，给她最小的孩子喂奶，罗伯特和妹妹安静地在墙角玩耍。

“太好了！——我知道你会来的！”看到我进来，利文太太叫了起来。

“是呀，贝茜，”我吻了吻她说，“我相信来得还不算晚，里德太太怎么样了？——我希望她还活着。”

“是的，她还活着，比以前神志更清醒了，也安定了一些。医生说她会拖上一周两周，但认为她不大可能恢复。”

“这几天她还提到我吗？”

“今天早上还说起过你呢，希望你能来。不过她现在睡着了，或者说十分钟之前我在楼上的时候，正睡着呢。一般整个下午她都躺在那儿昏睡，六七点钟才醒。小姐，你在这儿休息一个小时，然后我再陪你一起上去好吗？”

这时罗伯特进来了，贝茜把睡着的孩子放进摇篮，过去迎接他。接着，她非让我脱掉帽子，用点茶点，因为她说我看上去既苍白又疲惫。我很乐于接受她的殷勤招待，顺从地任她脱去旅行服，就像小时候任她脱去衣服一样。

她来来去去地忙着，拿出最好的瓷器，摆上茶盘，切好面包和奶油，烤上喝茶时吃的点心，不时还轻轻地拍一拍或推一推罗伯特或简，就像小时候对我一样，往事又立刻浮上了我的心头。贝茜还保持着她轻快的步伐，好看的容貌，还有急躁的脾气。

茶点准备好了，我正要走近桌子，她却用从前那种不容违抗的口气让我坐着别动。她说，一定要给我端到火炉旁吃。她把一张小圆几儿放在我面前，上面摆了一杯茶和一盘点心，就像过去她把悄悄拿来的好吃的放在育儿室的椅子上给我吃一模一样。我像从前一样微笑着听从她的安排。

她想知道我在桑菲尔德府过得是不是高兴，女主人怎么样。当我告诉她只有一个男主人时，她问我他是不是一位好先生，我是不是喜欢。我告诉她我的主人长得比较难看，却很有教养，待我很好，我很满意。然后我就继续给她讲最近在府上寻欢作乐的那批客人，贝茜兴致勃勃地听着，这正是她最爱听的。

谈着谈着一小时很快就过去了，贝茜又把帽子、衣服给我穿好，陪着我到宅子里去。大约九年前她也是这样陪着我，从我现在走的小径走下来的。在一月份的一个灰暗阴冷、雾蒙蒙的早晨，我怀着绝望怨恨的心情——一种被驱逐和近乎被摒弃的感觉，离开了这所充满敌意的房子，去洛伍德寻找那寒冷的避风港，那个遥远而陌生的地方。现在，这所充满敌意的房子又出现在我的面前，我的前途渺茫，我的心还隐隐作痛。我仍然觉得自己是在世间漂泊。但对于我自己和自己的力量有了更强的自信，面对压迫也不再畏惧退缩。饱受委屈的流血的伤口，如今也已愈合，怨恨的火焰已经熄灭。

“你先去餐厅，”贝茜领我穿过大厅时说，“小姐们会在那儿。”

不一会儿我就进了那个房间。这儿的每件家具和我被初次介绍给布罗克赫斯特先生的那个早上一模一样。他站过的那块地毯仍旧铺在壁炉前。朝书架上一看，我仍能辨认出比维克的两卷本《英国禽鸟史》，仍旧放在第三个格，还有再上面一格的《格列佛游记》和《天方夜谭》。无生命的东西依旧，有生命的东西却变得认不出了。

两位年轻的小姐出现在我面前，一位个子很高，与英格拉姆小姐相仿——也很瘦，脸色发黄，神情严肃。看上去有点苦行者的感觉，极度朴实的穿着和打扮，更加重了这种感觉。她穿着黑色直筒呢裙，浆洗过的麻布领圈，头发从两鬓往后梳，戴着修女的装饰品，一串黑檀木念珠和一个十字架。我猜这肯定是伊丽莎，尽管从她那张拉长了的毫无血色的脸上，已经很难找到一点与昔日的她相似的地方了。

另外一位肯定是乔治亚娜，不过已经不是我记忆中纤瘦苗条、仙女般的十一岁姑娘乔治亚娜了。这是一位如花盛开、十分丰满的年轻姑娘，肤色像个蜡人似的洁白，端正漂亮的五官，含情脉脉的蓝眼睛，黄色的鬈发。她衣服的颜色也是黑色的，但样式却与她姐姐的大不相同——要飘逸合身得多——看上去很时髦，而另一位看上去则像位清教徒。

姐妹两个人各自都有她们母亲的一个特征——只有一个。瘦削苍白的姐姐有着她母亲的烟水晶般的眼睛，而娇嫩如花的妹妹却继承了母亲颏骨和下巴的轮廓——也许要稍微柔和一些，但这却给她原本娇艳美丽的脸上加上了一种无法描绘的冷峻。

等我走上前去的时候，两位小姐都站起来迎接我，都称呼我为“爱小姐”。伊丽莎的招呼短促而突然，也没有笑容。说完她又坐下了，眼睛盯着炉火，似乎把我忘了。乔治亚娜在“你好”之后又加了几句关于旅途和天气之类的寒暄，说话时慢声慢气，还不时侧眼看我，从头到脚打量着——目光时而掠过我的黄褐色美利奴毛皮外衣的褶缝，时而停留在我乡村式小帽的普通饰边上。年轻小姐们自有一套绝妙的办法，让你知道她认为你是个“怪物”而不必说出来。某种高傲的神态，冷淡的举止和漠然的语调，就充分表达了她们在这方面的感情，完全不需要什么无礼的言行。

然而，不管是明嘲还是暗讽，现在对我来说已经失去了曾经有过的影响力。我坐在两位表姐妹中间，惊讶地发现自己对一位的完全忽视、另一位半带讥讽的殷勤处之泰然——伊丽莎并没有使我难堪，乔治亚娜也没有使我生气。事实上我有别的事情要考虑。最近几个月里，我内心被唤起的感情，比她们所能引起的要强烈得多——所激起的痛苦和欢乐也远比她们所能造成和赐予的要剧烈得多——她们的态度不论好坏我都不会关心。

“里德太太怎么样了？”我马上问道，神情平静地望着乔治亚娜，她认为应当对这样的称呼表示愤怒，仿佛那是一种出乎意料的冒昧行为。

“里德太太？哦！你说的是妈妈。她的情况非常糟糕，我怀疑你今晚是否能见她。”

“如果，”我说，“你能上楼去告诉她说我来了，我会非常感激的。”

乔治亚娜惊讶得几乎跳了起来，一双蓝眼睛睁得大大的。“我知道她特别希望见到我，”我补充了一句，“除非绝对必要，我可不愿意迟迟不满足她的愿望。”

“妈妈不喜欢晚上有人打搅。”伊丽莎说。我立刻站起来，默默地脱去帽子和手套，说我要去见贝茜——我想贝茜一定在厨房里——叫她问清楚里德太太今晚是否愿意接待我。我找到了贝茜，让她去问问，同时考虑进一步要采取的措施。在这以前，我一直习惯于在傲慢面前退缩：如果这是在一年之前，我会决定明天早晨就离开盖茨黑德。而现在，我明白那是个愚蠢的想法。我长途跋涉一百英里来看舅妈，我必须留下来直到她好转或者离世。至于她女儿们的高傲或愚蠢，我应该抛在一边，不去理睬，不受她们的影响。因此，我招呼管家，让她给我安排一个房间，告诉她我或许要在这儿待上一两周，让她把我的箱子搬到房间里去。我也跟着去那里，走到楼梯口时，我碰到了贝茜。

“太太醒着，”她说，“我告诉她你来了。来，看看她还认不认得你。”

我不用别人带领就能走进那个熟悉的房间，以前我总是被叫到那里挨骂受罚。我在贝茜之前轻轻推开了门。桌子上点着一盏有灯罩的灯，天色已渐渐暗下来。和以前一样，还是那张琥珀色帐幔罩着四根大床柱的床，还是以前的梳妆台、安乐椅、脚凳。在这条脚凳上，我曾经成百次地被罚跪，请求她宽恕我并没有犯过的过错。我朝附近的墙角看了一眼，很想看到曾使我胆战心惊的细长木条，因为过去它总是躲在那里，像魔鬼一样伺机蹿出来，抽打我发抖的手或往后缩的脖子。我走到床前，打开床幔，朝高高叠起的枕头俯下身去。

我清楚地记得里德太太的那张脸，急切要寻找那熟悉的面孔。令人高兴的是，时光平息了报复的渴望，消除了愤怒与厌恶的冲动。过去我带着痛苦与仇恨离开了这个女人，现在又回到了她身边，仅仅是出于对她遭受的巨大痛苦的同情，我强烈渴望忘却和宽恕她对我的种种伤害——希望彼此和解，握手言欢。

那里是一张熟悉的面孔，还是那样冷酷无情——任何东西也无法软化的眼睛和微微扬起的专横独断的眉毛，曾有多少次向我投来恐吓和仇视的目光！如今，我辨认出它那严峻的轮廓时，童年时代的恐惧和悲伤的记忆又都复活了！然而我还是弯下腰，吻了吻她。她看着我。

“你是简·爱吗？”她说。

“是的，里德舅妈。你好吗，亲爱的舅妈？”

我曾经发过誓再也不会叫她舅妈。但是我想此刻忘记和违背自己当初的誓言并不是罪过。我紧紧地握着她放在被单外面的手。如果她和蔼地握一握我的手，我会由衷地感到愉快，但是顽固的本性不是立刻就能被软化的，天生的反感也并非轻易就能被消除。里德太太把手缩了回去，转过脸，说夜晚很暖和。她还是那么冷冰冰地对待我，我立刻感觉到她对我的看法——对我的感情——没有改变，也永远不会变。从她石头般的眼神——那温情无法打动、眼泪无法溶解的冷漠的眼神中看出，她决心到最后一刻都认为我很坏，因为相信我是好人给她带来的不会是宽厚的愉快，而是一种屈辱的感觉。

我感到痛苦，接着是愤怒，但最后我下定决心要征服她——不管她的本性和意志怎么样，我都要控制它。像小时候那样，我的眼泪涌了上来，但我硬把它们压了回去。我拿起一把椅子放到床头，我坐在椅子上，向枕头俯下身去。

“是你派人叫我来的，”我说，“现在我来了，我想住下来看看你的病怎么样。”

“噢，当然！你见我女儿了吗？”

“见到了。”

“好吧，那你可以告诉她们，我希望你待下去，直到我能跟你谈谈我心里想着的一些事情。今天已经太晚了，而且我回忆起来有困难。不过我想说一件事情——让我想想——”

她游移的目光和走了样的语调证明她那曾经强壮的身体受到了多大的伤害。她焦躁地翻着身，想用被子裹住身体，正好我的一只胳膊放在被角上，把它压住了，她立刻发起火来。

“坐直了！”她说，“别压住被子让我生气——你是简·爱吗？”

“我是简·爱。”

“谁都不会知道这个孩子给我带来了多大的麻烦。给我留下了这么大一个累赘——她那让人摸不透的性子，常常突然就发脾气，还是鬼鬼祟祟地看别人的一举一动，她每天每刻给我带来多少烦恼啊！我肯定地说，有一次她像疯子或者像个魔鬼似的对我说话——没有哪个孩子会像她那样说话或看人。我很高兴把她从这里撵走了。在洛伍德他们是怎么对待她的呢？那里发生了伤寒，很多孩子都死了，而她居然没有死。但是我说她死了——希望她已经死了！”

“真是一个奇怪的愿望，里德太太，你怎么会那么恨她？”

“我一直讨厌她的母亲，因为她是我丈夫唯一的妹妹，他很宠她。她降低身份结了婚，他却坚决反对家里人和她断绝关系。得知他妹妹的死讯时，他哭得像个傻子。他要把孩子接来，尽管我恳求他说我宁愿自己付钱把孩子送到外面交给保姆养。我第一次见到她就讨厌她——一个哭哭啼啼、病病歪歪的东西！她整夜在摇篮里哭——不像别的孩子那样放声大哭，而是呜呜咽咽、哼哼唧唧。里德可怜她，亲自喂她照顾她，仿佛是自己的孩子似的。说实在的，他自己的孩子这么大的时候，他都没有这么关心过。他想让我的孩子友好地对待这个小要饭的，宝贝们受不了，可是只要他们表现出不喜欢她，里德就会发火。他病重时，还不断地叫人把她抱到他床边，而临终前一小时让我发誓抚养这个小东西。我倒宁愿养一个从济贫院里出来的小叫花子。可是他软弱，天生软弱。约翰一点不像他父亲，我为此感到高兴。约翰像我和我的兄弟们——他真是十足的吉卜森家的人。哎，但愿他不要老是写信要钱来折磨我！我已经没有钱给他了。我们变穷了。我得辞掉一半的用人，把一部分房子关闭或者租出去。我决不甘心这样做——可是要不我们该怎么生活下去呢？我把三分之二的收入都拿去付抵押借款的利息了。约翰赌得太厉害了，而且老是输——可怜的孩子！他被一群赌棍骗子团团围住了。约翰变坏了，堕落了——他的样子太可怕了——看到他我都为他丢脸。”

她越来越激动。“我想我现在还是离开好。”我对站在床另一边的贝茜说。

“或许是，小姐，不过到了晚上她总是这么说话的——早上比较安静。”

我站起身来。“站住！”里德太太叫起来，“我还有件事要和你说。他威胁我——不断用他的死或我的死来威胁我。有时我梦见他正等着入殓，喉咙上一个大窟窿，或者鼻青脸肿。我到了一个奇怪的关口，我遇到了大麻烦。我该怎么办？到哪儿去弄钱呢？”

这时，贝茜竭力说服她服用镇静剂，好不容易才说服她。里德太太渐渐安静下来，陷入了昏睡状态，于是我离开了她。

十多天过去了，我都没有再次和她谈话。她不断地昏迷或是昏睡。医生禁止她做一切会让她痛苦或激动的事情。这期间，我尽力跟乔治亚娜和伊丽莎处好关系。的确，她们起初十分冷淡。伊丽莎会一坐半天，缝纫、读书或者写字，几乎不和我和她妹妹说话。乔治亚娜会喋喋不休地对着她的金丝雀几个小时说一些无聊的话，根本不理我。但我下定决心，不显得无所事事，或是不知如何消磨时光的样子。我带来了绘画工具，这样既让自己有事可做，又可以消磨时光。

我拿了画笔和画纸，经常在离她们较远的靠窗的地方坐下，忙着画一些想象中的图画，表现出变幻不定的想象中万花筒里的各种景象。例如，两块礁石之间的一片大海、初升的月亮、横穿月亮的一条船、一丛芦苇和菖蒲、一个仙女头戴荷花从荷叶中探出头来、一个精灵坐在一圈山楂花下的篱雀窝里，等等。

一天早晨，我着手画一张脸，至于要画什么样的脸，我既不关心，也不知道。我取了一支黑色软铅笔，把笔尖弄得粗粗的，画了起来。不一会儿，我就在纸上勾勒出了一个宽阔突出的额头，脸的下部画得方方的。这个外形使我感到愉快，我的手指又继续画上了五官。在额头下，画了两条引人注目的平直的眉毛，下面自然是轮廓分明的鼻子，笔直的鼻梁和大大的鼻孔，然后是看上去很灵活、中等的嘴巴，再是坚毅的下巴，中间有一道明显的凹痕。当然还有黑黑的络腮胡和漆黑的头发，浓密地长在两鬓，在前额蜷曲成波浪形。要画眼睛了，我把它们留到最后，因为它们需要小心仔细地描绘。我把眼睛画得大大的，很好看，睫毛又长又浓，眼珠又黑又亮。“好！可是不完全像，”我一边观察这效果，一边想，“还少一点力量和精神。”我把暗处加深，这样可以让明亮处更闪亮——恰到好处地加了一两笔，就圆满地完成了。这样，我的一位朋友的脸就出现在了我的面前，那两位小姐不理睬我又有什么关系呢？我看着它，看着这栩栩如生的肖像微笑着；我看得出神，感到心满意足。

“那是你熟人的一幅肖像吗？”伊丽莎问，我没有注意到她已经朝我走了过来。我回答说：这不过是想象的一个头像，连忙把它塞到其他画纸下面。当然我是撒谎，其实那是罗切斯特先生的一张十分逼真的肖像。但这和她，或是除我以外的任何一个人有什么关系呢？乔治亚娜也走来看。别的几幅画她都很喜欢，却把那一幅说成“一个丑陋的男人”，她们两个对我的技艺感到吃惊，我提出要给她们画肖像，两个人轮流坐着让我画铅笔轮廓像。然后乔治亚娜拿出了她的画集。我答应画一幅水彩画让她放到她的画集里面，她听了以后立刻高兴起来，提议到庭园里去散步。我们出去还不到两个小时，就无话不谈了。她向我讲述了两个社交季之前在伦敦度过的出尽风头的那个冬季，如何受到倾慕，如何引人注目，我甚至还听到了有爵位的人也倾心于她的暗示。那天下午和晚上，这类暗示越来越多，她复述各种情意绵绵的情话，描绘了一些动情的场面。总之，那天她为我即席创作了一部描写上流社会生活的小说。这类谈话一天天继续着，始终围绕着同一个主题——她自己，她的爱情和苦恼。很奇怪，她一次也没有提到她母亲的病情和哥哥的死，或者是现在她们家庭惨淡的前景。她似乎满脑子都是对昔日欢乐的回忆和对未来奢侈生活的向往，每天在她母亲的病榻前只待上五分钟，一分钟也不多待。

伊丽莎依然沉默寡言。显然她没有时间说话，我从来没有见过像她看起来这么忙碌的人，可是很难说她究竟在忙些什么，或者不如说很难发现她忙碌的结果。她有一个闹钟，早早地把自己叫起来。我不知道早餐前她干些什么，但早餐后她把自己的时间分成几段，每个小时都有规定的任务。她一天三次读一本小书，我仔细看了一下，原来是本祈祷书。一次我问她，书中最吸引人的是什么，她说“礼拜规程”。三个小时用于缝纫，用金线给一块方形红布缝边，这块布大得足可以用做地毯。我问起它的用途，她告诉我是铺在盖茨黑德附近新建教堂祭坛上的，两个小时用来写日记，两个小时在菜园里劳动，还有一个小时用来整理账目。她似乎不需要同伴，也不需要交谈。我相信她一定自得其乐，满足于这种按部就班的工作，如果发生了什么事情迫使她改变钟表般准确的规律，这是最让她恼火的了。

一天晚上，她比平时话多一些，告诉我约翰的行为和家里面临的破落是她烦恼的根源。但她说现在已经安下心来，下定了决心。她已经留心保住了她自己的财产，一旦她母亲去世——她冷静地说，母亲不可能痊愈或者长久拖下去了——她将实现自己酝酿已久的计划，寻找一个归隐之处，使自己严守时间的习惯不受干扰，并且在自己和浮华的世界之间设立一个安全的屏障。我问她要不要乔治亚娜陪伴她。

她回答说：当然不。乔治亚娜和她没有共同之处，从来没有过。无论如何她不要她的陪伴，让自己自讨苦吃。乔治亚娜应当走她自己的路，而她伊丽莎也会走自己的路。

乔治亚娜不向我倾诉心事的时候大都躺在沙发上，抱怨家里太沉闷，一再希望吉卜森舅妈会寄来邀请信，请她到城里去。她说：“如果能躲开一两个月，等一切都过去，那就最好了。”我并没有问她“一切都过去”的含意，但我猜想她指的是她母亲的死，以及随后悲伤的葬礼。伊丽莎对妹妹的懒散和怨言并不在意，仿佛她面前并不存在这个嘀嘀咕咕、懒洋洋躺在那儿的人。不过有一天，她收起账簿，打开绣花活时，突然责备起她来：

“乔治亚娜，在地球上没有比你更爱虚荣、更荒唐的动物了。你根本不该生下来，因为你在糟蹋生命。你非但没像一个有理智的人该做的那样，为自己生活，安分守己地生活，靠自己生活，反而一味想依靠别人的力量来支撑你的软弱。如果找不到人愿意背这个肥胖、孱弱、自负、无用的包袱时，你就会大嚷大叫，说你受到了亏待，受到了冷落，遭到了不幸。而且，你认为生活应该是不断变换、充满刺激的一场戏，否则这个世界就是监狱。你要别人爱慕你，追求你，恭维你——你要有音乐、舞会和社交活动——否则你就会一天天憔悴枯萎。难道你就没有头脑想出一套办法来，不依赖别人，只靠你自己的努力和自己的意志？拿一天来，你就把它分成几份，每分钟规定好任务，全部时间都包括在内，不留一刻钟、十分钟、五分钟的零星空闲时间。井然有序、有条不紊地干每一件事。这样，在你几乎还没发觉一天已经开始的时候，它就已经结束了。这样你就用不着欠别人的情，帮你消磨空闲时间了。你用不着求人给你做伴交谈，用不着请求别人的同情和忍耐。总之，你像一个独立的人应该生活的那样生活。听从我的劝告吧，这是我给你的第一个，也是最后一个忠告。那样，无论出什么事，你就不需要我或者是别人也行了。如果你不听劝告——仍像现在这样想入非非、哀叹、懒散，你就得承受你愚蠢行为带来的后果了，不管它会如何糟糕，如何难以忍受。我要明白告诉你，你好好听着。虽然我不准备再重复我说的话，但我会坚定地去做。母亲一死，你的事我就彻底不管了。从她的棺材抬进盖茨黑德教堂墓地那天起，你我就各不相干像没有认识过一样。你不要以为我们碰巧是同一个父母，我会让你以丝毫站不住脚的理由拖累着。我可以告诉你——就是除了你我以外，整个人类都毁灭了，在地球上只有我们两个，我也会让你留在旧世界，而独自奔向新世界。”

她闭了嘴。

“你还是不必费神做什么长篇大论了，”乔治亚娜回答说，“谁都知道你是世上最自私、最没良心的家伙。我知道你对我有刻骨的仇恨，这我有真实的例子——你在埃德温·维尔勋爵的事情上对我玩的诡计。你受不了我的地位比你高，得到贵族头衔，被你连面都不敢露的社交圈子所接纳。因此你从中扮演了奸细和告密者的角色，永远毁了我的前途。”

乔治亚娜说完掏出手帕，在这以后的一个小时里，她一直在擤鼻涕；伊丽莎冷冷地坐着，无动于衷，忙着自己的活儿。

确实，有些人不重视真挚宽厚的感情。不过这里表现出来的两种性格，却因为少了它，一种刻薄得叫人难以容忍，而另一种枯燥乏味得可鄙。没有理智的感情固然淡而无味，但缺乏感情的理智也太苦涩粗糙叫人难以下咽。

一个风雨交加的下午，乔治亚娜在沙发上看一部小说，看着看着就睡着了。伊丽莎去新教堂参加万圣节仪式——因为在宗教方面，她严格拘泥于形式，风雨无阻，按时履行着心中虔诚的义务。不论天气好坏，每个星期上教堂三次，平时只要有祷告仪式也一定要参加。

我想起要上楼去，看看这个生命垂危的女人病情如何。她躺在那里，几乎没有人照料；用人们也只是想起来的时候才去照料一下；雇来的护士，因为没有人看管，想溜就溜。贝茜虽然是忠心的仆人，但也有自己的家要照应，只能偶尔过来。果然，房间里没有人照看，护士不在。病人一动不动地躺在那儿，似乎在昏睡，铅灰色的脸深陷在枕头里，炉中的火也快熄灭了。我添了燃料，重新收拾了床单，看了她一会儿。这时，她已经无法睁开眼睛看我了。接着，我朝窗子走过去。

大雨猛烈地敲打着窗子，狂风呼啸着。“那个躺在那儿的人，”我想，“很快就要超脱人世间的风风雨雨了。此刻，灵魂正挣扎着脱离躯壳，一旦得到解脱，将会到哪里去呢？”

我在思索这个重大的谜时，想起了海伦，想起她临终时说的话——她的信仰——脱离了躯体的灵魂都是平等的。在想象中仍倾听着她那难以忘怀的声音，她平静地躺在临终的病榻上，低声诉说着要回到神圣的天父怀抱的渴望，想象着她苍白超越尘世的容貌、消瘦的脸庞和令人崇敬的凝视，那时……正想着，我身后的床上响起了微弱的声音：“是谁呀？”

我知道里德太太已经几天没有说话了，是她醒过来了？我朝她走了过去。

“是我，里德舅妈。”

“我——又是谁？”她回答，“你是谁？”她诧异而惊恐地看着我，但神色还没有失常，“我一点儿不认识你——贝茜呢？”

“她在门房，舅妈。”

“舅妈！”她重复了一声。“谁叫我舅妈呢？你不是吉卜森家的人，不过我知道你——那张面孔，那双眼睛和那个前额，我很熟悉。你像——对，你像简·爱！”

我默不做声，怕一说出我的身份会让她受惊。

“可是，”她说，“恐怕这是个错觉，我的头脑混乱不清。我很想看看简·爱，就凭空想象看到了相似的人。再说，过了八年，她的变化一定很大。”我这才慢慢地让她相信，我就是她猜想和想见的人。看她似乎明白了我的意思，头脑也还镇静，我就告诉她，贝茜如何派她丈夫把我从桑菲尔德叫来。

“我的病很重，这我知道，”没过多久她说，“几分钟之前，我一直想翻身，却发觉胳膊腿都动弹不了。看来临死之前，我还是把心事说出来才能安心。身体好时很少想的事，现在却像沉重的包袱似的压在我的心头。护士在吗？房间里除了你，没有别人吗？”

我向她保证只有我们两个。

“哎，我两次做了对不起你的事，现在我后悔了。一次是违背了我对丈夫许下的诺言，没有把你当做自己孩子抚养成人。另一次——”她停住了，“毕竟这不是什么重要的事情。”她喃喃自语，“那样我也许会好受些，但是，这样低声下气地和她说话，我实在太痛苦了。”

她挣扎着要换一下姿势，但没有成功。她的脸色变了。她似乎经历着某种内心的激动——也许是最后一阵痛苦的先兆。

“哎，我得了却这桩心事。长眠就在眼前，我还是告诉她好。到我化妆盒那儿去，打开它，把你看到的一封信拿出来。”

我照她说的做了。“读一读那封信。”她说。

这封信很短，文中写道：





太太：

烦请惠告我侄女简·爱地址，并告知其近况。我欲立即去信，盼她来马德拉我处。托上帝之福，目前我家境富裕。我未娶无后，甚望有生之年将她收为养女，并在死后将全部财产馈赠于她。谨致敬意。

约翰·爱于马德拉





日期是三年之前。

“为什么我从来没有听说过这件事？”我问。

“因为我对你讨厌之极，因此不愿意帮助你，让你过上好日子。我忘不了你对我的举动，简——你有一次冲我大发脾气，你说在这个世界上你最讨厌我的腔调；你说一想起我就恶心，说我冷酷地虐待你——丝毫不像孩子的神情与口气。我也忘不了你这样突然发作，把心头的怨气尽情地发泄时我的感受：我觉得害怕，就好像我曾经打过或者推过的动物忽然抬起头来，用人一样的眼光看着我，用人一样的声音诅咒我……拿些水来！快点！”

“亲爱的里德太太，”我把她要的水端给她时说，“别再想这些了，忘了吧。原谅我说的那些气话，那时我还只是个孩子，离现在已经八九年了。”

她根本没听我在说些什么。只是喝了水，喘了口气，又继续说：

“我告诉你我忘不了这些，所以进行了报复。让你由叔叔领养，去过舒适宽裕的日子，我不能忍受。我写信给他，说是很遗憾让他失望了，但简·爱死了，在洛伍德死于伤寒。现在随你怎么办吧，写封信否认我的说法——揭露我的谎话。我想，你生来就是专门折磨我的。让我临死之前还要回想起曾经做过的事而不得安宁。如果不是因为你，我本来不会禁不住诱惑，去干那种事的。”

“如果你能听从劝告，不再想这些，舅妈，用宽厚和原谅的心来对待我——”

“你的脾气很坏，”她说，“这种性格我到今天都难以理解。九年中，不管怎样对待你，你都忍耐着，默默无声，而到了第十年，却全部爆发出来了，我永远无法理解。”

“我的脾性并不像你想的那么坏，我易动感情，却不爱报复。小时候有很多次，只要你允许，我很愿意爱你。现在我诚恳希望同你和好。吻吻我吧，舅妈。”

我把脸颊凑向她嘴唇。她却不愿碰它，还说我倚在床上压着她了，而且再次要水喝。我让她躺下时——因为我扶起她，让她靠着我的胳膊喝水，把手放在她冷冰冰、湿腻腻的手上，她衰竭无力的手指缩了回去了——失神的眼睛避开了我的目光。

“那么，爱我也好，恨我也好，随你便吧。”我最后说，“反正你已经彻底得到了我的宽恕。现在你去请求上帝的宽恕，安心吧。”

可怜而痛苦的女人！现在想努力改变她惯有的想法，已经太晚了。活着的时候，她一直恨我——临终的时候，她肯定仍然还在恨我。

这时，护士进来了，贝茜跟在后面。我又待了半小时，希望看到某种和解的表情，但她没有任何表示。她很快又陷入昏迷状态，没有再清醒过来。当晚十二点她去世了。我没有在场给她合上眼睛，她的两个女儿也不在。第二天早上，她们来告诉我，一切都过去了。那时她的遗体已等候入殓，伊丽莎和我都去看她，乔治亚娜号啕大哭，说她不敢去看。萨拉·里德的躯体躺在那里，过去是那么强健而充满生机，现在却僵硬不动了。冰冷的眼皮遮住了她无情的双眼，额头和强硬的面容仍带着她冷酷灵魂的印记。对我来说，那具尸体既奇怪又严肃。我看着她，心中忧伤而痛苦。它引起的不是温柔、甜蜜、惋惜，或是希望、压抑的感觉，而只是一种为她的不幸——不是我的损失——而感到强烈的痛心，以及她的死亡所引起的忧郁和无泪的沮丧。

伊丽莎镇定地打量着她母亲。沉默了几分钟后，她说：

“像她那样的体质，本可以活到高龄，是烦恼缩短了她的寿命。”接着她的嘴抽搐了一下，然后转身离开了房间，我也离开了。我们两个人谁也没有掉一滴眼泪。





第二十二章


罗切斯特先生只给了我一个星期的假，可是我却一直过了一个月才离开盖茨黑德。我想葬礼后立即动身，乔治亚娜却恳求我一直待到她去伦敦，因为她的舅舅吉卜森先生在他主持完他姐姐的葬礼和安排家庭事务后终于邀请她去伦敦了。乔治亚娜害怕同伊丽莎单独相处，说是情绪低沉时得不到她的同情，胆怯时得不到她的支持，收拾行装时得不到她的帮助。所以我尽量忍受着她软弱的哀叹，自私的怨天尤人，尽力帮她做针线活，收拾行装。确实，在我忙着的时候她会闲着什么也不做。我暗想：“如果你我注定要长期一直生活，表姐，那我就要把事情重新安排了。我不该乖乖地成为忍受的一方，而会把你的一份活儿分派给你，迫使你去完成，否则就让它留着不做。我还一定要让你把那些慢声细气、半真半假的诉苦咽到你肚子里去。正是由于我们之间的关系十分短暂，而且又是在特殊的悲伤的时期，所以我才甘愿忍耐和顺从。”

我终于送走了乔治亚娜，可是现在却轮到伊丽莎要求我再住一个星期了。她说她的计划需要她全力以赴，因为就要动身去某个未知的目的地了。她成天闩上门待在自己房间里，装箱子，腾空抽屉，烧掉信件纸张，不和任何人交谈。她希望我替她看管房子，接待来客，回复唁函。

一天早晨，她告诉我不用再麻烦我了。“而且，”她补充道，“对于你提供的宝贵的帮助和周到的办事成果我很感激。和你相处和与乔治亚娜相处，是不同的。你在生活中尽自己的责任，而不会成为别人的负担。明天，”她继续说，“我要动身去大陆。我会在里斯尔[1]附近给自己找个栖身之所——你大概会称它为修道院。在那里我会安静度日，不受干扰。我要花一段时间来潜心研究罗马天主教教义，仔细研究他们的修道方式。如果我发现它正如我大体上预想的那样，是最能保证把什么都办得规规矩矩、井井有条的话，那我会皈依天主教，或许还会正式去当修女。”

听到这个决定，我既没有表示惊奇，也没有试图劝阻她。“这对你再适合不过了，”我想，“但愿它会对你大有益处！”

我们分手时，她说：“再见，简·爱表妹，祝你好运，你还是有些见识的。”

我回答道：“你也不是没有见识，伊丽莎表姐。但再过一年，我想你所有的见识会被活活地囚禁在法国修道院的围墙之内。不过这不关我的事儿，既然这样对你适合——我并不太在乎。”

“你说得很对。”她说。我们彼此说了这几句话后，便各奔东西了。由于我没有机会再提起她或她的妹妹了，我不妨在这儿说一下。乔治亚娜有了一桩对她有利的婚事，嫁给了上流社会一个年老的有钱人。伊丽莎果真做了修女，一段见习期过后，现在就在她做修女时见习过的那个修道院当院长，还把全部财产都捐给了修道院。

人们外出，不管是长时间还是短时间，回家时的心情如何，我不知道，因为我从来没有这种经历。但我知道，小时候走了很远的路后回到盖茨黑德府，因为怕冷或担心挨骂是什么滋味。还有后来在洛伍德，我从教堂回来，渴望一顿丰盛的饭菜和生得很旺的炉火，结果这两种又什么都得不到时心里的感觉。这两种回家的感觉都不是令人愉快和向往的，因为没有什么磁力吸引我奔向目标，不是越走近吸引力就越大。至于这次回到桑菲尔德的感觉，还有待我去体味。

旅途是令人厌倦的——非常令人厌倦。白天走五十英里，晚上在旅店过夜。第二天又走五十英里。最初十二个小时，我总是想着临终前的里德太太。我看到她变了形的、没有血色的脸，听见了她奇怪的走了调的声音。我回想着举行葬礼的那一天，棺材、灵车、一队队穿黑衣服的佃户和用人——亲戚参加的不多——挖好的墓穴、寂静的教堂、庄严的仪式。随后我想起了伊丽莎和乔治亚娜，我看见一个是舞场的中心人物，另一个是修道院陋室的修女。我继续思索着，分析着她们各自的个性和品格。傍晚时抵达一个大城镇，这些想法被驱散了。夜间，我的思绪转到了其他的事情上。我躺在旅店的床上，抛开回忆，想着未来。

我就要回到桑菲尔德了，但是我会在那儿待多长时间呢？不会太久，我确信这一点。在我离开的那段时间，费尔法克斯太太写信告诉我，府上的聚会已经散了，罗切斯特先生三周前动身去了伦敦，不过预定两周后就返回。费尔法克斯太太推测，他是去准备婚礼的，因为他曾说起要购置一辆新马车。她还说，罗切斯特先生打算娶英格拉姆小姐，她总觉得有些奇怪。不过根据众人说的，也根据她亲眼见的来看，她就不再怀疑婚礼很快就要举行了。“如果你连这也怀疑，那真是太多疑了。”这是我心里的评论，“我一点也不怀疑。”

接下来的问题就是：“我去哪儿呢？”我整夜都梦见英格拉姆小姐。在生动逼真的晨梦中，我看见她当着我的面关上了桑菲尔德的大门，给我指了指另外一条路。罗切斯特先生袖手旁观——好像在对我和她冷笑。

我没有告诉费尔法克斯太太我回去的确切日期，因为我不希望派普通马车或是高级马车到米尔科特接我。我打算一个人静静地走完这段路。因此，我把箱子交给旅店的马夫后，在六月的一个黄昏，六点钟左右，我悄悄地从乔治旅店出发，踏上了通往桑菲尔德的老路，这条路大部分穿过田野，现在已经很少有人走了。

这是一个夏日的傍晚，虽晴朗暖和却并不明亮，沿路晒制干草的工人们正忙碌着。天空虽然远说不上万里无云，却仍有好天气的兆头。天空的蓝色——在看得见蓝色的地方——柔和而稳定，云层又高又薄。西边显得很温暖，没有饱含雨意的闪闪水光给它带来凉意——看上去好像有一团火在大理石般雾气的屏障后的一个祭坛上燃烧着，从缝隙中射出金色的光。

剩下的路越来越短，我心里非常高兴，高兴得有一次竟停下脚步问自己，这种喜悦究竟是什么意思，并提醒理智，我不是回到自己家里，或是去一个永久的安身之处，我是到一个亲密的朋友盼望我、等我到达的地方。“费尔法克斯太太肯定会以平静的微笑表示欢迎。”我说，“而小阿德拉会又跳又拍手，不过你心里很明白，你想的不是她们，而是另外一个人，而这个人却不想你。”

但是，有什么比青春更任性的吗？有什么比幼稚更盲目的呢？青春与幼稚认定，不管他是不是看我，有幸能再看到罗切斯特先生总是令人愉快的；它们还补充说：“快点！快点！在还可能的时候跟他在一起，只要再过几天，最多几个星期，你就与他永别了！”于是，我抑制住了刚刚在心里产生的新的痛苦——一个我自己都不敢强迫去承认和养育的畸形儿——又继续赶路了。

在桑菲尔德的草地上，人们也在晒制干草，或者更确切些，我到时那些干活的人正要收工，他们肩上扛着草耙打算回家去。我只要再走过一两块田地，就可以穿过大路，到大门口了。树篱上的蔷薇花真多啊！但我没时间采，急于赶回去。我经过一棵高大的蔷薇，它叶茂花盛的枝丫一直伸到了小路中间。我看到了窄窄的石阶，我还看到——罗切斯特先生坐在那里，手里拿着一本书和一支铅笔，正在写着什么。

是的，他并不是魔鬼，但我的每一根神经都紧张起来。一时间我竟无法控制自己。这是怎么回事？我还从未想到一见他就颤抖起来——或者在他面前竟然一句话也说不出来。如果我还能动的话，我一定会返回。因为没有必要让自己变成一个大傻瓜，我知道通往桑菲尔德的另一条路。但是即使我认得二十条路也没有用了，因为他已经看到了我。

“喂！”他叫道，收起了书和铅笔，“你回来啦！请过来。”

我想我确实走过去了，尽管自己也不清楚是怎么走过去的。我几乎对自己的动作一无所知，一心想着镇定，尤其要控制面部肌肉的活动——而它却公然违抗我的意志，拼命要把我决心掩饰的东西表露出来。好在我还戴着面纱——把面纱放下来。我可以尽力装出镇定自若的样子。

“这是简·爱吗？你从米尔科特来，步行来的吗？不错——又是你的一个鬼点子，不叫人派一辆马车去接你，像普通人一样沿着大街小巷走回来，还要在黄昏，偷偷来到你家附近，仿佛你是一个梦或者影子。真见鬼，你这一个月都干了些什么？”

“我和我舅妈在一起，先生，她去世了。”

“真是地道的简·爱式的回答！但愿善良的天使保护我吧！她刚从另一个世界来——从死人的住所来，而且还要趁黄昏时我一个人的时候这么告诉我。如果我敢的话，我真应该摸摸你，看你是实实在在的人，还是一个影子。你这个小精灵！——可是我甘愿去沼泽地里捕捉五色的鬼火[2]。玩忽职守的小东西！玩忽职守的小东西！”他停了一会儿又接着说：“离开我整整一个月，我敢保证，你肯定已经把我忘得一干二净了！”

我知道和主人重逢是一件愉快的事，尽管担心他很快就不再是我的主人了，而且我明明知道对他来说我算不了什么。不过在罗切斯特先生身上（至少我认为）永远有着一种使人快乐的巨大力量，只要尝一尝他撒给像我这样迷途的孤鸟的面包屑，就无异于饱餐一顿盛宴了。他最后的几句话使我得到了安慰，意思似乎是：我有没有忘记他，对他来说还比较重要呢，他还把桑菲尔德说成是我的家——但愿那是我的家！

他一直没有离开台阶，我也不想让他让路。我接着问他是不是去过伦敦了。

“是的，我想你是通过千里眼发现的吧。”

“费尔法克斯太太在信里告诉我了。”

“她告诉你我去干什么了吗？”

“呵，是的，先生！谁都知道你这次去的目的。”

“你一定要看看这辆马车，简，而且，如果你认为它完全适合罗切斯特太太，就告诉我。她靠在紫色的软垫上，像不像波狄西亚女王[3]。简，但愿我的外貌和她更般配一点。你是个小精灵，你能不能告诉我——能不能给我一道符咒，或者有魔力的药，或是某种类似的东西，让我变成一个美男子呢？”

“这不是魔力所能办到的，先生。”说完，我又在心里补充了一句：“充满爱的目光，就是你需要的魔力。在这样的目光中，你已经够美了，或者不如说，你严厉的神情已经具有一种超越美的力量。”

罗切斯特先生有时有一种我所无法理解的敏锐，能看透我没有说出的想法，现在他没有在意我唐突的口头回答，而是用他自己特有的微笑回答了我。这种微笑在他的脸上很少看到，似乎他认为太珍贵了，舍不得用于普通的场合。这确实是富有情感的阳光——而此刻他用它照耀着我的全身。

“走过去吧，珍妮特[4]。”他说着腾出地方，让我跨过台阶，“回家去，在朋友的家门口，让你那双不停奔波而疲倦了的小脚休息一会儿吧。”

现在我唯一能做的就是默默地听从他，不必再说什么了。我一声不响地跨过台阶，打算平静地离开他。但是一种冲动紧紧地抓住了我——一种力量迫使我回过头来。我说道——或者是内心的某种东西不由自主地替我说道：

“罗切斯特先生，谢谢你对我的好意。回到你身边，我感到说不出的高兴，你在哪儿，哪儿就是我的家——我唯一的家。”

我走得那么快，就是他要追也追不上。小阿德拉一见我乐得差点儿疯了，费尔法克斯太太仍然用她那朴实的友情接待了我。莉娅朝我笑笑，甚至连索菲也愉快地对我说了声“晚上好[5]”。我感到非常愉快。被自己周围的人所爱，自己的存在也使他们感到舒适，没有比这更幸福的了。

那天晚上，我紧闭双眼，不去想将来；我堵住耳朵，不去听那些不断警告我离别已经临近、伤心即将到来的声音。喝过晚茶，费尔法克斯太太开始了编织，我在她旁边的一个较低的座位上坐下来，阿德拉跪在地毯上，紧紧地依偎着我。亲密的感觉，像宁静的金色光环围绕着我们。我默默地祈祷着，希望我们彼此不要分离得太远，不要分离得太早。但是正当我们这样坐着时，罗切斯特先生悄悄地进来了，望着我们，似乎对如此融洽的景象感到愉快——正当他说，既然老太太又见到了自己的养女，想必她已安心，并补充说他看到阿德拉“恨不得把她的英国小妈妈一口吞下去[6]”时——我近乎冒昧地希望，即使在结婚以后，他也会把我们一起安置在某个地方，得到他的庇护，而不至于被完全地从他的阳光照耀下赶出去。

我回到桑菲尔德府后的两个星期，平静得让人生疑。丝毫没有听到有人提起主人的婚事，也没有看到做什么准备。几乎每天我都会问费尔法克斯太太，她是否听说已经做出了决定。她的回答总是否定。有一次她说，其实她已经问过罗切斯特先生，什么时候把新娘接回家来，但他只是开个玩笑，做个鬼脸。她实在猜不透他的意思。

有一件事更让人感到奇怪，他并没有奔走于两个庄园之间，没有去英格拉姆小姐的庄园拜访：离这儿只有二十英里，在另一个郡的边界上。但这点距离对一个热恋中的情人来说算得了什么？对于像罗切斯特先生这样一位熟练而不知疲倦的骑手，那只不过是一个上午的行程。我不禁萌生不该有的希望：这门婚事告吹了，传言不实，一方或双方改变了主意。我常常观察我主人的脸，看他是伤心还是恼怒，但是我想不起他有什么时候像现在这样没有一点忧愁和不快。在我和我的学生与他相处的时候，我偶尔兴致不高或者情绪低沉时，他反而更加兴高采烈。他从来没有这样经常地把我叫到他面前，到那之后他对我从来没有像现在这样亲切过——还有，哎！我也从来没有像现在这样地爱着他。

第二十三章


仲夏明媚的阳光普照英格兰。接连许多天都可以见到明净的天空、灿烂的阳光；在我们这个风浪环绕的岛国，即使短短一两天也难得碰上这样的好天气。仿佛意大利的好天气像一群欢快的候鸟从南方飞过来，落在英格兰的悬崖上歇脚。干草已经收了进来，桑菲尔德周围的田野已经收割干净，显出一片绿色。道路被阳光烤得发白，树木郁郁葱葱，十分茂盛。树篱与林子一片浓荫，枝繁叶茂，与它们之间收割过的遍地阳光的草地形成了鲜明的对比。

施洗约翰节[1]前夕，阿德拉在海村小路上采了半天的野草莓，累坏了，太阳一落山就上床睡觉。看着她睡着后，我离开她向花园走去。

现在是二十四小时中最美好的时刻——“白昼已耗尽了它的烈火”，清凉的露水落在透不过气的平原和烤焦了的山顶上。在夕阳没有亮丽的云彩的陪伴、平平淡淡落下的地方，铺展开了一抹庄严的紫色，在山峰的一个尖顶上燃烧着红宝石和炉火般的光辉，向高处和远处伸延，显得越来越柔和，覆盖了半个天空。东方也有它自己湛蓝悦目的美，也有它谦虚的珍宝，一颗徐徐升起的孤星。它很快会以月亮而自豪，不过这时月亮还在地平线之下。

我在石子路上散了一会儿步，可是隐约有一阵细微而熟悉的清香——雪茄的气味——悄悄地从某个窗子里钻了出来。我看见图书室的窗开了一手宽的缝隙。我知道可能有人在那儿看着我，就离开那儿进了果园。整个庭园里没有比这更隐蔽、更像伊甸园的地方了。这里树木繁茂，鲜花盛开，一侧有高墙与院子隔开；另一侧是一条长满山毛榉的林荫道，像屏障似的与草坪隔开。果园尽头是一道坍塌的篱笆，这是它与寂寞的田野唯一的分界线。一条小径蜿蜒着通向篱笆，两旁种着月桂树，最后面是一棵巨大的七叶树，树下是一圈座位。你可以在这儿漫步而不被人发现。在这种蜜似的露水渐渐降落、万籁俱寂、暮色渐浓的时刻，我觉得仿佛会永远在这样的阴影中漫步。但这时我被初升的月亮投向园中高处开阔地的光芒所吸引，穿过花圃和果园，我停下了脚步——不是因为听到或是看到了什么，而是因为再次闻到了一种引起我警惕的香味。

香蔷薇、青蒿、茉莉、石竹和玫瑰早已奉献着它们的晚香，刚刚飘过来的气味既不是来自灌木，也不是来自花朵，它是——我熟悉的——罗切斯特先生的雪茄气味。我向四周看了看，仔细听着。我看到树上满是即将成熟的果实，听到夜莺在半英里外的树上歌唱；我看不见走动的身影，也听不到任何走近的脚步声，但是那香味却越来越浓了。我得赶紧逃走。我向通往灌木林的小门走去，却看见罗切斯特先生正走进来。我往旁边一闪，躲进了长满常春藤的隐蔽处。他不会停留很长时间，很快就会回去，只要我坐着不动，他肯定不会看到我。

可是不行——黄昏对他来说也像我所感觉的一样可爱，古老的园子对他来说也是一样迷人。他继续向前走着，一会儿拎起醋栗树枝，看看梅子般大的累累果实；一会儿从墙上摘下一颗熟透了的樱桃；一会儿又向着一簇花弯下腰，不是闻一闻香味，就是欣赏花瓣上的露珠。一只大飞蛾嗡嗡地从我身旁飞过，落在罗切斯特先生脚边的一株花上，他看见了它，弯下腰仔细地看着。

“现在，他背对着我，”我想，“而且又那么聚精会神，如果我脚步轻一点，也许我可以偷偷地走掉，他不会发觉。”

我沿着路边的草皮上走，免得走在沙石路上发出声音暴露自己。他站在离我要经过的地方有一两码远的花坛中间，显然那只飞蛾吸引了他的注意。“我会顺利地走过去的。”我暗想。月亮还没有升得很高，把他的影子长长地投在地上，我正要跨过这影子，他却头也不回就轻声说：

“简，过来看看这家伙。”

我没有发出声音，他背后也没长眼睛——难道他的影子有感觉吗？我先是吓了一跳，然后就朝他走去。

“你看它的翅膀，”他说，“它让我想起了西印度的昆虫，在英国不常见到这种又大又艳丽的夜游虫。啊！它飞走了。”

飞蛾飘走了。我也正想怯生生地走开。可是罗切斯特先生跟着我一直到了小门，他说：

“回来吧。这么可爱的夜晚，坐在屋子里太可惜了。在日落紧接月出的时刻，肯定没有人想睡觉。”

我有一个缺点，那就是尽管我口齿伶俐，对答如流，但在需要寻找借口的时候却往往无话可说，尤其在某些关键时刻，特别是在需要一句脱口而出的话或者一个理由充足的借口来摆脱窘境时。我不愿在这个时候单独和罗切斯特先生在幽暗的果园里散步。但是我又找不出一个脱身的理由。我慢吞吞地跟在后头，拼命动脑筋想出一个脱身的办法来。可是他看上去那么泰然自若，又那么严肃，反而让我为自己的慌乱而感到不好意思了。行为不端——如果说是现在还是以后有什么行为不端的话——那也只能说我有。他心里却泰然自若，浑然不觉。

“简，”我们正踏上长满月桂的小径，慢慢走向矮篱笆和七叶树时，他又开口了，“夏天的桑菲尔德可是个可爱的地方，是吗？”

“是的，先生。”

“你肯定有些依恋桑菲尔德了——你有欣赏自然美的天赋，而且又很容易产生依恋之情。”

“我的确依恋这个地方。”

“而且，尽管我不理解是什么原因，但我看得出，你已经开始关心阿德拉这个小傻瓜，甚至对头脑简单的老太太费尔法克斯也相当关心吧。”

“是的，先生，我都爱她们，尽管方式不同。”

“离开她们你会很难过吧？”

“是的。”

“真可惜！”他说，叹了口气，停了一会儿，“生活中有些事情总是这样，”他又继续说，“你刚在一个愉快的休憩处安顿下来，一个声音又叫你起来继续赶路，因为休息的时间已经过了。”

“我必须要继续赶路吗，先生？”我问，“我必须离开桑菲尔德吗？”

“我想是的，简，我很抱歉，珍妮特，但我认为你确实该走了。”

这是一个打击，可我还没有被它打倒。

“那好，先生，让我走的命令一下，我就走。”

“现在命令来了——我今晚就不得不下。”

“这么说，您是要结婚了，先生？”

“确——实——如——此，一——点——不——错。凭你一贯的机敏，你一下子就猜中了。”

“快了吗，先生？”

“很快，我的——哦，爱小姐，你还记得吧，简，我第一次，或者是传言把我的打算明白地告诉你，我打算把我这个老单身汉的脖子套进神圣的绞索里，踏入结婚的圣坛——简单地说，把英格拉姆小姐搂入我的怀抱——她是很大的一抱，不过没关系：像我美丽的布兰奇这样的宝贝，是谁都不会嫌大的。嗯，就像我刚才说的——听我说，简！别回头去看还有没有飞蛾吧？那不过是个瓢虫，孩子，‘正飞回家去’。我想提醒你一下，正是你以我所敬佩的审慎，那种适合你责任重大而又依人谋生的地位的明智和远见，首先向我提出，如果我娶了英格拉姆小姐，你和小阿德拉两个还是立刻离开好。我并不计较这一建议所隐含的对我意中人人格上的诋毁。的确，在你远离我的时候，珍妮特，我会尽量把它忘掉。我所注意到的只是其中的明智之处，我已把这种明智奉为我行动的准则。阿德拉必须上学，而你，爱小姐，必须找一份新的工作。”

“是的，先生，我会马上去登广告，在这期间我想——”我想说：“我想我可以待在这里，直到我另外找到一个住处。”但我停了下来，觉得不能冒险说一个长句，因为我的声音已经难以自制了。

“大约再过一个月，我就成为新郎了，”罗切斯特先生继续说，“在这段期间，我会亲自为你留意找一份工作和一个住处。”

“谢谢您，先生，我很抱歉给您——”

“啊——不必道歉！我认为一个下属把工作做得像你一样出色时，她就有权要求雇主给予一点容易办到的小小的帮助。其实，我已经从我未来的岳母那儿听说，有一个我看来适合你去的地方，是在爱尔兰康诺特的苦果山庄，教迪奥尼修斯·奥加尔太太的五个女儿，我想你会喜欢爱尔兰的，听说那儿的人都非常热心。”

“离这儿很远，先生。”

“没有关系——像你这样有见识的姑娘是不会害怕航行或路远的。”

“不是航行，而是距离。还隔着大海——”

“和什么隔着大海，简？”

“和英格兰和桑菲尔德，还有——”

“什么？”

“和您，先生。”

我不由自主地说出了口，眼泪也未经意志的同意就夺眶而出。但我没有哭出声来，我不想抽泣。一想到奥加尔太太和苦果山庄就让我寒了心，但更让我寒心的是在我与此刻同我并肩而行的主人之间的茫茫大海，而最让我寒心的是，更加辽阔的海洋——那隔在我和我无法避免、自然而然爱上的人之间的财产、地位和习俗。

“路很远。”我又说了一句。

“的确很远。等你到了爱尔兰康诺特的苦果山庄，我就永远也见不到你了，这是确定无疑的。我从来不去爱尔兰，因为我不太喜欢那个国家。我们一直是好朋友，简，是吗？”

“是的，先生。”

“在分别的前夕，朋友们往往喜欢亲密地度过留给他们的很少的时间。来吧——星星在那边天上闪烁时，我们用上半个小时左右的时间，平静地谈一谈航行和离别。这儿是一棵七叶树，这有围着老树根的凳子。来吧，今晚我们就安安静静地坐在这儿，尽管我们以后再也不会坐在一起了。”他让我坐下，自己也坐了下来。

“到爱尔兰很远，珍妮特，我很抱歉让我的小朋友去做那么令人厌倦的旅程。不过，我没法安排得更好了，那又有什么办法呢？简，你觉得你和我有点相似吗？”

这一次我没冒险做出回答，我心里很平静。

“因为，”他说，“有时我对你有一种奇怪的感觉——尤其是你像现在这样靠近我的时候。仿佛我左面的肋骨上有一根弦，跟你小小的身体同样地方的一根类似的弦打成了结，打得紧紧的，解都解不开。如果波涛汹涌的海峡和二百英里左右的陆地把我们远远分开，恐怕这根联系的弦也会折断。那样我有一种紧张的想法，我的内心会流血。至于你——你会忘掉我。”

“我永远也不会，先生，你知道——”我说不下去了。

“简，听见夜莺在树林中歌唱了吗？——你听！”

我听着听着便哭泣起来，再也抑制不住压抑在我心中的感情，我不得不任其流露了，我痛苦万分地浑身战栗着。等我能说出话来，我只能表达一个强烈的愿望：但愿自己从未出生，从未到过桑菲尔德。

“你是因为要离开这儿而难过吗？”

悲伤与爱情在我内心所激起的强烈的感情，正占上风，并竭力支配一切，压倒一切，战胜一切，要求生存、扩展和最终主宰一切，是的——还要求说出来。

“离开桑菲尔德我很伤心。我爱桑菲尔德——我爱它，因为我在这里过的生活充实而愉快——至少现在是。我没有受到别人的轻视，也没有被弄得古板僵化，没有被埋没在低劣的人之间，也没有被排斥在同光明、健康、高尚的心灵交往的一切机会之外。我已经面对面和我所敬重的人、我所喜欢的人——和一个独特、活跃、宽广的心灵交谈过。我认识了你，罗切斯特先生，知道我必须要永远和你分开，这让我感到恐惧和痛苦。我知道我非走不可，就像我感到自己非死不可一样。”

“你从哪儿感到的？”他突然问道。

“从哪儿？你，先生，你已经把这些放在了我的面前。”

“以什么形式呢？”

“以英格拉姆小姐的形式，一个高贵而漂亮的女人——你的新娘。”

“我的新娘！什么新娘？我没有新娘！”

“可是你会有的。”

“对。我会！——我会！”他咬紧牙齿。

“那我非走不可——你自己亲口说的。”

“不，你非留下不可！我发誓——这个誓言我一定会遵守的。”

“我告诉你，我非走不可！”我有点恼火了，反驳说，“你以为，我会留下来做一个对你来说无足轻重的人吗？你以为我是一架机器？——一架没有感情的机器？能够容忍别人把仅有的一口面包从我嘴里抢走，把仅有的一滴生命之水从我杯子里泼掉？难道就因为我贫穷、低微、长相平庸、个子瘦小，就没有灵魂，没有心灵吗？——你想错了！——我和你一样有灵魂，我的心和你的一样充实！如果上帝赋予我一些美貌和财富，我也会让你难以离开我，就像现在我难以离开你一样。我不是通过习俗、常规，甚至也不是通过凡人的肉体在和你说话，而是我的灵魂在和你的灵魂对话，仿佛我们两个人经过了坟墓，站在上帝脚下，是平等的——因为我们本来就是平等的！”

“本来就是平等的！”罗切斯特先生重复了一遍——“就这样。”他补充道，用胳膊把我抱住，搂到怀里，把嘴唇贴到我的嘴唇上。“就这样，简？”

“对，就这样，先生，”我回答，“可是并没有这样。因为你已结了婚——或者说等于是结了婚，和一个配不上你的人——一个你并无好感的人——我不相信你真的会爱她，因为我看到过，也听到过你对她嗤之以鼻。对这样的婚姻我表示不屑，所以我比你还要好一些——让我走！”

“去哪儿，简？去爱尔兰？”

“是的——去爱尔兰。我已经把心里话都说出来了，现在去哪儿都行。”

“简，平静点，别这样挣扎了，像一只发疯的鸟儿一样，绝望地撕碎自己的羽毛。”

“我不是鸟儿，也没有网要捕我。我是一个有独立意志的自由人，现在我要运用自己的意志离开你。”

经过又一次努力后我自由了，笔直地站在他面前。

“你的意志会决定你的命运。”他说，“我把我的手、我的心和我的一切财产的分享权都献给你。”

“你在上演一出闹剧，我看了只会发笑。”

“我请求你和我一起度过余生——做我的另一半和我最好的终身伴侣。”

“对于那种命运，你已经做出了你自己的选择，那就应该遵守。”

“简，安静一会儿，你太激动了，我也要平静下来。”

一阵风顺着月桂小径吹来，穿过摇曳着的七叶树枝，飘走了——走了——到了渺茫的远方——消失了。夜莺的歌声成了此刻唯一的声音，听着听着我又哭了起来。罗切斯特先生静静地坐着，温柔而严肃地望着我。过了好一会儿他才开口说：

“到我身边来，简，让我们解释一下，彼此谅解吧。”

“我再也不会回到你身边了，我已经被拉走，不可能再回来了。”

“可是，简，我是叫你过来做我的妻子，我要娶的只有你。”

我没有回答，心想他是在取笑我。

“过来，简——到这边来。”

“你的新娘挡在我们中间。”

他站起身来，一步就跨到了我跟前。

“我的新娘在这儿，”他说着，再次把我拉向他的怀里，“因为配得上我的人在这儿，和我相像的人在这儿。简，你愿意嫁给我吗？”

我仍然没有回答，仍在努力挣脱他的怀抱，因为我仍然不相信他的话。

“你是在怀疑我吗，简？”

“绝对怀疑。”

“你不相信我？”

“一点也不信。”

“在你眼里我是一个撒谎者吗？”他情绪激动地问，“疑神疑鬼的小东西，我一定要让你相信。我对英格拉姆小姐有什么爱情？没有，这你是知道的。她对我有什么爱情？没有，这和我想办法证实的一样。我放出谣言到她那儿，说我的财产还不到人们猜想中的三分之一，然后，我去看看效果如何。她和她的母亲对我都非常冷淡。我不愿意——也不可能——娶英格拉姆小姐。你——你这古怪的——你这近乎是精灵的小东西——我像爱我自己一样爱你。你——虽然贫穷、低微、长相平庸、个子瘦小——我请求你答应让我做你的丈夫。”

“什么，我！”我失声叫了出来。看到他的认真，尤其是他的鲁莽，我开始相信他的真诚。“我，在这个世上除了你以外，一个朋友也没有的我——如果你是我朋友的话——除了你给我的钱，一个先令也没有的我？”

“就是你，简。我必须让你属于我——完全属于我。你愿意吗？快说‘愿意’。”

“罗切斯特先生，让我看看你的脸。转过去朝着月光。”

“干吗？”

“因为我要仔细看看你的脸，转呀！”

“那儿，你会发现它并不比一张揉皱了的、乱涂过的纸更容易看懂。看吧，不过快些，因为我难受。”

他的脸焦急不安，涨得通红，五官表情强烈，眼睛闪出奇异的光芒。

“呵，简，你在折磨我！”他嚷道，“你用那种犀利而忠实宽厚的目光看着我，你在折磨我！”

“我怎么会呢？如果你是真诚的，你的求婚也是真的，那么我对你的感情只会是感激和忠诚——不可能是折磨。”

“感激！”他脱口喊道，然后又发狂似的补充道——“简，快答应我吧。说，爱德华——叫我的名字——爱德华，我愿意嫁给你。”

“你是认真的吗？——你真的爱我？——你真心希望我成为你的妻子？”

“是的。如果我必须发誓的话才能让你满意，那我就发誓。”

“那么，先生，我愿意嫁给你。”

“叫爱德华——我的小妻子。”

“亲爱的爱德华！”

“到我身边来——完完全全过来。”他说。把他的脸贴着我的脸，用深沉的语调对着我的耳朵补充说：“使我幸福吧——我也会使你幸福。”

“上帝宽恕我吧！”一会儿他又加了一句，“不要让别人来干涉我，我得到了她，我要守住她。”

“没有人会干涉，先生。我没有亲戚来干涉。”

“没有——那再好不过了。”他说。如果我不是那么爱他，我会认为他的口气和他狂喜的表情有些野蛮。然而，我从离别的噩梦中醒来——被唤入结合的乐园，坐在他身旁，只想着源源而来的幸福。他一遍又一遍地问我：“你幸福吗，简？”我一遍又一遍地回答：“是的。”随后他又喃喃地说着：“我会赎罪的——会赎罪的。我不是发现她没有朋友，身边太冷清，需要安慰吗？我不是会保护她，珍爱她，安慰她吗？难道我的心里没有爱情，我的决心不是坚定不移吗？那这一切会在上帝的法庭上得到宽恕。我知道造物主会准许我这样做的。至于世间的评判——我可以不管，别人的议论——我毫不在乎。”

可是，夜晚发生了什么变化？月亮还没有下落，我们已经完全被笼罩在一片黑暗之中了。虽然主人离我这么近，但我几乎看不清他的脸。七叶树受了什么折磨？它翻腾着，呻吟着，狂风在月桂树小径怒号着，向我们横扫过来。

“我们必须进去了，”罗切斯特先生说，“天气变了。不然我真想和你坐到明天早晨，简。”

“我也是。”我想，“想和你在一起。”也许我会说出来，可是一道惨白的闪电从我正仰望着的云层闪出来，然后是咔嚓一声霹雳和近处的一阵隆隆雷声。我除了把自己被照得眼花缭乱的眼睛靠在罗切斯特先生的肩膀上藏起来，什么也顾不上了。

大雨倾盆而下，他催我赶快沿着小径穿过庭园回屋去。可是我们还没跨进门槛，身体就已经全被淋透了。罗切斯特先生在客厅里给我取下披肩，把水滴从我松散的头发上抖掉。这时，费尔法克斯太太从她的房间里出来了，开始我和罗切斯特先生都没有看到她。灯亮着，时钟正敲响十二点。

“快把湿衣服脱下来，”他说，“在走之前，晚安——晚安，我亲爱的！”

他不断地吻我。我从他的怀抱里脱出身来抬起头一看，只见那位寡妇站在那儿，脸色苍白，神情严肃而惊讶。我只是对她笑了笑，就跑上楼去了。“等以后解释也不晚。”我想。但是回到房间里，一想到她哪怕是暂时对她所看到的情景产生的误解，心里也是极度不安，然而喜悦抹去了所有其他的感情。在两个小时的暴风雨中，尽管狂风大作，雷声隆隆，电光闪个不停，暴雨瀑布般地倾注，我既没有感到害怕，也没有感到恐惧。在这期间罗切斯特先生三次来到我的门前，问我是否平安无事：这就是安慰，这就是足以应付一切的力量。

早晨还没起床，小阿德拉就跑来告诉我，果园尽头的那株大七叶树昨天夜里遭到了雷击，被劈掉了一半。

[1]施洗约翰节，每年6月24日。





第二十四章


我起床穿衣的时候，回想着发生的事，怀疑它是不是一场梦。在我再次看见罗切斯特先生、听到他重申他的爱和诺言之前，我实在无法确定这就是真的。

在梳理头发时，我看着镜子里自己的脸，感到它不再平淡无奇了。面容透出了希望，脸色有了活力，眼睛仿佛看到了丰收的源泉，反射出了光彩夺目的涟漪的光芒。过去我常常不愿去看主人，因为我怕他不喜欢我的相貌。但是现在我相信，我可以扬起脸来看他了，我的外貌不会使他的爱冷却。我从抽屉里拿了件朴素但是干净的浅色夏装穿上；似乎从来没有一件衣服像这件这样适合我，因为没有一件是在这种幸福的心情里穿上的。

我跑下楼去，来到大厅，昨天的暴风雨过后是阳光灿烂的六月早晨。从敞开的玻璃门外吹来一阵清新芬芳的微风，我一点也没有感到奇怪。既然我是如此快乐，大自然也一定非常高兴。一个讨饭的女人和她的小男孩——全都脸色苍白，衣衫褴褛——沿着小径走过来，我跑过去把钱包里所有的钱都给了他们——大约三四个先令，不管怎样，让他们也分享我的欢乐。白嘴鸦呱呱叫着，更活泼的鸟儿在唱歌，可是什么也不比我自己内心的欢唱更美妙动听。

让我吃惊的是，费尔法克斯太太神色忧愁地望着窗外，她严肃地说：“爱小姐，请来用早餐好吗？”吃饭时她安静而冷淡。但是我那时还无法给她解释清楚。我得等我的主人来解释，所以她也只好等待了。我勉强吃了一点，匆匆上了楼，碰见阿德拉正要离开读书室。

“你去哪儿？上课的时间到了。”

“罗切斯特先生让我去育儿室。”

“他在哪儿？”

“就在里面。”她指了指她刚离开的房间。我走进去，他正站在那儿。

“过来对我说声早安。”他说。我高兴地走过去。现在我得到的不仅仅是一句淡淡的话，或者是握一握手，而是拥抱和亲吻。受到他这样的热恋和爱抚，似乎显得十分亲切和自然。

“简，你看上去容光焕发，笑盈盈的，漂亮极了。”他说，“今天早晨你真的很漂亮。这就是我那个脸色苍白的小精灵吗？这就是我的小芥子吗？是这个脸带笑靥，有玫瑰色的嘴唇、光滑的褐色头发，和发亮的褐色眼睛的小姑娘吗？”（读者，我的眼睛是绿色的，但是您要原谅他的错觉，对他来说我的眼睛染上了新的颜色。）

“我是简·爱，先生。”

“很快就要叫做简·罗切斯特了，”他补充说，“四个星期以后，珍妮特。一天也不多，你听到了吗？”

我听到了，但是我不能完全理解，它让我头都晕了。他的宣布在我心头所引起的感觉，是一种和喜悦极不相同的更强烈的东西——一种让人震惊、发呆的东西。我觉得这近乎恐惧。

“你刚才脸还发红，现在却脸色发白了，简。那是为什么？”

“因为你给了我一个新名字——简·罗切斯特，这听起来很奇怪。”

“是的，罗切斯特太太，”他说，“年轻的罗切斯特太太——费尔法克斯·罗切斯特的少女新娘。”

“这绝不可能，先生，听起来不大可能。在这个世界上，人类永远享受不到全部的幸福。我也不会有与我的同类不同的命运，只有在童话里，在白日梦里这样的命运才会降临到我头上。”

“我能够而且也要实现这样的梦想，从今天就开始。今天早上我已经写信给我伦敦的银行代理人，让他把我托他保管的珠宝——桑菲尔德女主人的传家宝——送过来一些。我希望再过一两天后把它们统统倒入你的裙兜里，我要像娶一个贵族女儿一样，把能给你的一切特权和关心，都给你。”

“呵，先生！——别提珠宝了！我不喜欢说起珠宝。对简·爱来说，珠宝听来既不自然又很古怪，我可不要这些。”

“我会亲自把钻石项链戴在你的脖子上，把头饰套在你的额头上——一定会很相配的，因为大自然至少把它的贵族标志盖在这个额头上了，简。我还要在这纤细的手腕上套上手镯，给这仙女般的手指戴上戒指。”

“不，不，先生，想点别的话题，讲点别的事情，换种口气说话吧。不要把我当做美人似的同我说话，我不过是位相貌平平、像贵格会教徒似的家庭教师。”

“你在我眼里就是个美人。正好合我心意的美人——娇小而飘逸。”

“你的意思是瘦小而无足轻重吧。你在做梦呢，先生——不然就是有意取笑。看在上帝的分上，别挖苦人了！”

“我还要全世界都承认你是个美人，”他继续说，他说话的口气确实让我不安起来，我觉得他不是在盲目地欺骗自己，就是存心欺骗我，“我要让我的简·爱穿上缎子和花边衣服，头发上插上玫瑰花，我还要在我最心爱的人头上蒙上珍贵无比的面纱。”

“那你就认不出我了，先生，我不再是你的简·爱，而是穿了丑角衣装的猴子——一只披了别人羽毛的八哥。我不愿穿上宫廷贵妇的长袍，就像我不愿看见你罗切斯特先生穿上戏服一样；我并没有说你漂亮，尽管我非常爱你，太爱你了，所以不愿奉承你。你也别奉承我了。”

可是他不顾我的反对，还是接着这个话题继续说下去：“今天我就带你坐着马车去米尔科特，你得为自己挑选一些衣服。我和你说过了，四个星期后我们就举行婚礼。婚礼不张扬，就在下面那个教堂里举行。然后，我马上就把你送到城里。短暂停留后，我将带我的宝贝去阳光明媚的地方，到法国的葡萄园和意大利的平原去。她将看到在古老历史和现代记载中一切著名的东西；她还将尝到城市生活的风味。那时，她只要和别人比较一下，就知道看重自己了。”

“我要去旅行？——和你吗，先生？”

“你将住在巴黎、罗马和那不勒斯，还有佛罗伦萨、威尼斯和维也纳。凡是我漫游过的地方，你都得重新去走走，凡是我走过的地方，也要留下你仙女般的脚印。十年前，我发疯似的跑遍了欧洲，陪伴我的只有厌恶、憎恨和愤怒。如今我被治愈了、净化了，还有一位真正的天使给我安慰，陪我故地重游。”

他这样说的时候，我朝他微笑着。“我不是天使，”我说，“永远也不是。我是我自己。罗切斯特先生，你不该在我身上期望或强求只有天上才会有的东西——你不会得到的，就像我也无法从你身上得到一样，我根本就没期望这些。”

“那你期望我什么呢？”

“在短期内，你也许会与现在一样——一个很短的时期，然后你就会冷静下来，你会变得反复无常，又会严厉起来，而我得费尽心机让你高兴；可是等你完全习惯我了，你也许又会重新喜欢我——我是说喜欢我，而不是爱我。我猜六个月以后，或者更短一些，你的爱情就会化为泡影。我注意到在由男人撰写的书中，那是一个丈夫的热情所能保持的最长时间。不过话虽如此，我希望作为一个朋友和伴侣，永远不会让我亲爱的主人生厌。”

“生厌？重新喜欢你！我想我会再喜欢你，更喜欢你。我会让你承认，我不只是喜欢你，而是爱你——真挚、热烈、永不变心地爱你。”

“你不会反复无常吧，先生？”

“对那些只是以容貌来吸引我的女人，一旦我发现她们既没有灵魂也没有良心——看到她们乏味、浅薄，也许还有愚蠢、粗俗和性情暴躁时，我就成了真正的魔鬼。可是对于清澈的目光、流利的口齿，对于热情如火的心灵，对于既柔顺又稳重、既温顺又坚定、宁折不弯的性格时——我会永远温柔而真诚。”

“你遇到过这样的性格吗，先生？你爱上过这样性格的人吗？”

“我现在正爱着呢。”

“在我以前呢？我真的在各方面都符合你那苛刻的标准？”

“我从来没有遇到过能和你相比的人，简，你使我愉快。使我倾倒——你看上去很顺从，而我喜欢你给我的柔顺的感觉。我把一束柔软的丝线，绕过手指时，一阵战栗，从我的胳膊涌向我心里。我受到了感染——我被征服了。这种感觉比我所能表达的更加甜蜜，我所遭受的这种征服比我赢得的任何胜利都更为迷人。你为什么笑了，简？你脸上那种令人费解的、神秘的样子是什么意思？”

“我在想，先生（请你原谅我这个想法，这是不由自主的），我想起了赫拉克勒斯[1]、参孙[2]和使他们着迷的美女。”

“你在想这些，你这个小精灵——”

“嘘，先生！你刚才说的那些话并不比那些先生们的举动更聪明。不过，如果他们当初结了婚，我肯定他们也会用丈夫的威严代替求婚时的温柔，我担心你也会一样。如果一年以后我请你做一件你不方便或者不乐意的事，不知你会怎样答复我。”

“你现在就说一件事吧，简——哪怕是件琐碎的小事，我渴望听到你求我——”

“真的，我会的，先生。我现在就有个请求。”

“说吧！不过你要是带着那样的面容抬头含笑，那我不等弄清楚你要的是什么就发誓给你，我肯定会上你当的。”

“绝对不会，先生。我只有一个要求，就是不要叫人送珠宝，不要让我头上插满玫瑰花，你还不如把你那块普普通通的手帕镶上一条金边呢。”

“我还不如‘给纯金镶上金子’。我知道了，那么你的请求，我同意了——现在就这样。我会收回我给银行代理人的命令。不过你还没有向我要什么，你只要求我取消礼物。再提一个要求吧。”

“那好，先生。请你满足我在某件事上被大大激起的好奇心。”

他不安起来了。“什么？是什么？”他连忙问，“好奇心可是一个危险的请求理由：幸亏我没有发誓同意你的每个要求——”

“但是答应这个要求并没有什么危险，先生。”

“说吧，简。不过但愿你希望的不是打听——也许是打听一个秘密，而是希望得到我的一半财产。”

“哎呀，亚哈随鲁王[3]。我要你一半的财产干什么？你难道以为我是放高利贷的犹太人，要在土地上投资吗？我宁愿能与你推心置腹，如果你已答应向我敞开心扉，那你就不会不让我知道你的心事吧？”

“只要是值得知道的心事，简，都欢迎你知道。不过看在上帝的分上，别要求无用的负担！别渴望毒药——不要变成缠住我的一个地道的夏娃！”

“为什么不呢，先生？你刚才还告诉我，你多么高兴被我征服，多么喜欢对你提出过分的要求，你难道不认为，我最好利用一下你的表白，开始哄骗哀求——必要时甚至还可以哭闹、生气——只是为了尝试一下我的力量？”

“看你敢不敢做这样的试验。强行霸道，肆无忌惮，那就一切都完了。”

“是吗，先生？你马上就变了。现在你的表情多么严厉！你的眉头已皱得跟我的手指一样粗，你的前额像某些惊人的诗中所描写的那样犹如‘乌云层叠的雷霆’。我想那就是你结婚以后的神气了？”

“如果你结婚以后会是那副神情，像我这样的基督徒，会立刻打消娶一个十足的小妖精或者火神的念头。不过你该要什么呢，小东西？——说出来吧！”

“瞧，现在连礼貌也不讲了，和奉承相比，我更喜欢鲁莽。我宁愿做个小东西，也不愿做天使。我想问的是——你为什么费尽心机要我相信你想娶英格拉姆小姐？”

“就是这些吗？谢天谢地，不算太糟！”此时他松开了浓黑的眉头，低头朝我笑笑，还抚摸着我的头发，仿佛十分庆幸躲过了危险似的。“我想还是坦率地说比较好。”他继续说，“尽管我要让你生点儿气，简——我已经看到了，你生气的时候像一个火神。昨天晚上，在清凉的月光下，你反抗命运，声称你和我的地位是平等的。珍妮特，顺便提一句，是你先向我求婚的。”

“当然是我，但是还是请你说正题吧，先生——英格拉姆小姐。”

“好吧，我假装向英格拉姆小姐求婚，因为我希望让你爱我就像我爱你那样发狂；我知道，为了达到这个目的，忌妒是我所能找到的最好的盟友。”

“好极了！现在你很渺小——丝毫不比我的小手指尖大。简直是奇耻大辱，这种想法可耻透顶，难道你一点也不考虑英格拉姆小姐的感情吗，先生？”

“她的感情只有一种——骄傲。那就需要把她的气焰压下去。你妒忌了吗，简？”

“这你别管，罗切斯特先生。你是不在乎知道这个的。再老实回答我一次，你不认为英格拉姆小姐会为你的虚情假意感到痛苦吗？难道她不会有被遗弃的感觉吗？”

“不可能！——我告诉过你，正好相反，是她抛弃了我，一想到我破产了，她的热情一下子冷却甚至是熄灭了。”

“你真是古怪而工于心计，罗切斯特先生。恐怕在某些方面，你的行事准则相当古怪。”

“我的准则从来没有受过训练，简。由于缺乏关心，难免会有点歪了。”

“再认真地问一次，我可以享受到你向我担保的幸福，而不必担心有人会经受我刚经历过的痛苦吗？”

“你可以，我善良的小姑娘。世界上没有第二个人对我怀着像你一样纯洁的爱——因为我把那舒适的油膏，也就是对你的爱情的信任，涂到了我的心上。”

我把嘴唇转过去，吻了吻搭在我肩上的手。我深深地爱着他——深得连我自己也难以相信——深得难以用语言来表达。

“再提些要求吧，”他立刻说，“能被请求并加以同意，这是我的乐趣。”

我又有了新的请求：“把你的打算告诉费尔法克斯太太吧，昨晚她看见我和你待在大厅里，大吃一惊。在我再次见到她之前，你给她解释一下吧。让这样善良的女人误解，我很痛苦。”

“到你自己的房间去，戴上帽子，”他回答，“早上我想让你陪我到米尔科特去。在你准备上车之前，我会给这个老太太说清楚的。难道她认为，珍妮特，你为了爱而不顾一切，完全不值得吗？”

“我相信她认为我忘了自己的地位和你的地位，先生。”

“地位！地位！——现在，或者从今以后，你的地位就在我的心里，就在那些想污辱你的人的头上——去吧！”

我很快就穿好衣服，一听到罗切斯特先生离开费尔法克斯太太的起居室，便匆匆下楼赶到那里。这位老太太在读她早晨该读的一段《圣经》——这一天的功课。面前摆着打开的《圣经》，上面放着眼镜。在被罗切斯特先生的宣布打断以后，她似乎已经忘了自己刚才正在做的事情。她的眼睛呆呆地望着对面空无一物的墙上，流露出被一个不寻常的消息扰乱了平静心灵引起的惊讶。看到了我，她才回过神来，竭力想笑一笑，还想说几句祝贺的话。但她的笑容僵住了，她的话讲了一半讲不下去了。她戴上眼镜，合上《圣经》，把椅子从桌旁推开。

“我感到很吃惊，”她开始说，“我真不知道该对你说什么，爱小姐。我肯定不是在做梦吧，是不是？有时候我自己一个人坐着就朦朦胧胧地睡过去了，梦见了从来没有发生的事情。在打瞌睡的时候，我不止一次看见我十五年前去世的亲爱的丈夫，走进屋里，在我身边坐下，我甚至听到他像以前一样叫我的名字艾丽斯。现在，你能不能告诉我，罗切斯特先生真的已经向你求婚了吗？别笑话我，不过我确实觉得他五分钟之前进来对我说，一个月以后你就是他的妻子了。”

“他也是这样和我说的。”我回答。

“他说过！你相信他吗？你答应了吗？”

“是的。”

她疑惑不解地看着我。“这我怎么也想不到。他是一个很高傲的人。罗切斯特家族的人都很高傲，至少他的父亲很看重金钱，也经常让他谨慎。他的意思是要娶你吗？”

“他是这么告诉我的。”

她把我从头到脚打量了一番，从她的目光中我看出，她并没有在我身上发现足以解开这个谜的魅力。

“我真难以理解！”她继续说，“不过既然你这样说了，毫无疑问是真的了。以后的结局如何，我不知道。我真的不知道。在这类事情上，地位和财产方面彼此平等往往是明智的。何况你们两个人的年龄相差二十岁，他几乎可以做你的父亲。”

“绝对不会，费尔法克斯太太！”我恼火地大声说，“他一点儿也不像我的父亲！谁看见我们在一起，都绝不会有这种想法。罗切斯特先生看上去依然和有些二十五岁的人一样年轻。”

“他真的是因为爱你而娶你的？”她问。

她的冷漠和怀疑伤了我的心，眼泪涌上了我的眼眶。

“对不起让你伤心了，”寡妇继续谈下去，“可是你那么年轻，对男人的了解那么少，我希望让你存些戒心；老话说‘闪光的不一定都是金子’，而在这方面，我担心将来会出现你我都料想不到的事。”

“为什么？——难道我是个怪物？”我说，“难道罗切斯特先生不可能真心爱我？”

“不，你很好，而且近来比以前更好了。我猜罗切斯特先生很喜欢你。我一直注意到，你好像是他喜欢的人。有时候为你着想，我对他明显的偏爱感到不安，而且希望你警惕一些；但我甚至不想暗示会有出事的可能，我知道这种想法会使你吃惊，也许还会让你生气。你那么谨慎，那么谦逊，那么通情达理，我就抱着希望，希望你可以保护自己。昨天晚上，我找遍了整幢房子，到处都没有找到你，也没有找到主人，后来在十二点钟时我看到你和他一起进来，那时我的痛苦实在难以说明白。”

“好吧，现在别提这些了，”我不耐烦地打断了她，“一切都很好，那就够了。”

“我也希望最后一切都好，”她说，“不过，请相信我，你还是谨慎一些。尽量与罗切斯特先生保持一段距离，不要相信你自己，也不要太相信他，像他那样有地位的绅士通常是不大会娶家庭教师的。”

我真的恼火了，幸亏这时阿德拉跑了进来。

“让我去——我也要去米尔科特！”她嚷着，“罗切斯特先生不肯让我去，新马车里明明还有位子。求他让我去吧，小姐。”

“我会的，阿德拉。”我急急忙忙和她一起走开了，很高兴离开了这位让人丧气的告诫者。马车已经准备好了，他们正把它停在前门；我的主人在石子路上踱步，派洛特忽前忽后跟着他。

“阿德拉可以和我们一起去吗，先生？”

“我告诉过她不行，我不要小孩子——我只要你。”

“请你让她去吧，罗切斯特先生，那样会更好些。”

“不行，她会碍事。”

他的神情和语气都很专断。我想起了费尔法克斯太太令人寒心的警告和让我扫兴的疑虑，一种不踏实、不牢靠的感觉困扰着我的希望。我自认为能左右他的感觉失掉了一半。我正要机械地服从他，不再争辩时，他扶我上了马车，看了看我的脸。

“怎么啦？”他说，“阳光全不见了，你真的希望这个小家伙去吗？如果没带上她，你会不高兴吗？”

“我希望让她去，先生。”

“那就去戴上你的帽子，像闪电一样赶回来！”他朝阿德拉喊道。

她以最快的速度按他的吩咐去办了。

“一个上午的打搅没多大关系，”他说，“我马上就打算要你——你的思想、你的谈话和你的陪伴——一辈子只归我一个人了。”

阿德拉一被抱上车，就开始吻起我来，以表达对我替她说情的感激。她很快被藏到了靠他一边的角落里。她偷偷地朝我坐的地方扫视了一下，那么严肃的一位邻座使她很拘束。在他目前的心境下，她既不敢小声地发表什么意见，也不敢问他什么。

“让她到我这边来，”我请求道，“或许她会妨碍你，先生，我这边还有位子。”

他把她像递一只小狗一样递了过来。“我还是要送她上学去。”他说，不过现在是笑着说的。

阿德拉听了就问：她是不是一个人上学校，“不和小姐在一起了？[4]”

“是的，”他回答，“不和小姐在一起了[5]，因为我要带小姐到月亮上去，我要在火山顶上一个白色的山谷中找个山洞，小姐要和我住在那里，只和我一个人。”

“她会没有东西吃，你会把她饿坏的。”阿德拉说。

“我会在早上和晚上采集吗哪[6]给她吃，月亮上的平原和山边白茫茫一片都是吗哪，阿德拉。”

“她要取暖，用什么生火呢？”

“火会从月亮山上喷出来。她冷了，我会把她带到一座山峰上，让她躺在火山口的边上。”

“她在那儿会多糟——多不舒服啊！[7]还有她的衣服呢，都会穿坏的，她怎么做新的呢？”

罗切斯特先生假装给难住了。“哟！”他说，“你会怎么办呢，阿德拉？动动脑筋，想个办法。一片白云，或者一片粉红色的云做件长袍，你觉得怎么样？用彩虹也可以做一条不错的围巾。”

“她现在这样要好得多，”阿德拉想了一会儿说，“而且，在月亮上只和你生活在一起，她会觉得厌烦的。如果我是小姐，我肯定不会同意跟你去。”

“她已经同意了，还发了誓。”

“可是你没法带她去，没有道路能通往月亮，全都是空气。而且你与她都不会飞。”

“阿德拉，你看那边的田野。”现在我们已经出了桑菲尔德的大门，正沿着通往米尔科特平坦的道路，平稳而轻快地行驶着；暴风雨刚过去，路上没有飞扬的尘土，两旁低矮的树篱和挺拔的大树都青翠欲滴，被雨水冲洗得十分清新。

“在那边田野上，阿德拉，两个星期前的一个晚上，我散步到很晚的时候——就是你帮我在果园草地上晒干草的那天晚上，我收干草收得累了，就在一个台阶上休息；我取出一本小书和一支铅笔，开始写很久以前我遭到的不幸，和对未来幸福日子的憧憬。尽管阳光从树叶上渐渐隐去，我还是很快地写着，这时一个东西从小路上走来，在离我两码远的地方停了下来。我看了看它，是一个戴着薄纱的小东西。我招呼它走近我，它很快就站到了我的膝上。我没有和它说话，它也没有和我说话，可是我看懂了它的眼神，它也看懂了我的眼神。我们之间无声的谈话大致意思是这样的：

“它说，它是个小精灵，从精灵仙境来。它的使命就是让我幸福，我必须和它一起离开凡间，到一个人迹罕至的地方——譬如月亮上——它朝干草山上升起的月牙儿点了点头。它告诉我，我们可以住在石膏山洞和白银溪谷里。我说我想去，但我就像你刚才提醒的那样，提醒它我没有翅膀，不会飞。”

“‘哦，’那个精灵回答说，‘这没有关系！这里有个法宝，可以排除一切困难。’她递给我一枚漂亮的金戒指。‘把它戴上，戴在你左手第四个手指上，我就属于你，你就属于我了。我们将离开地球，到那边建立自己的天堂。’她又朝月亮点了点头。阿德拉，这枚戒指就在我裤袋里，变成一个金镑的硬币，不过我很快就要重新把它变成一枚戒指。”

“可是那和小姐有什么关系呢？我才不在乎精灵呢，你刚才不是说要带小姐到月亮上去吗——？”

“小姐是个精灵。”他神秘地低声说着。这时，我告诉她别去管他的玩笑了。而她却显示了她那份地道的法国式怀疑精神，把罗切斯特先生称作一个“十足的撒谎者[8]”，向他明确表示她毫不在乎他的“神话[9]”，还说：“再说，根本就没有仙女，就是有的话，[10]”她敢肯定，也绝不会出现在他的面前，也不会给他戒指，或者建议和他一起住在月亮上。

在米尔科特度过的那一个小时，对我来说，真有点烦。罗切斯特先生非要我到一家丝绸铺去，让我在那儿挑选六件衣服。我讨厌这事儿，请求他以后再说。“不行——现在就要办好。”经过我拼命在他耳边恳求，才由六件减为两件。不过他发誓要亲自挑选。我忐忑不安地看着他的目光在五颜六色的货品上转来转去，最后落在一块色泽鲜艳、十分华丽的紫晶色丝绸和一块粉红色高级缎子上。我又一次小声地告诉他，还不如同时给我买件金袍子和一顶银帽子更好些。我当然绝不会冒险地去穿他选择的衣服。费了好大的力气（因为他像顽石一般固执），我才说服他换一块素净的黑色缎子和珠灰色的丝绸。“这暂时还过得去。”他说，“不过，我还要看你穿得花团锦簇，光彩夺目。”

我很高兴总算催他走出了丝绸铺又走出了首饰店。他给我买的东西越多，我的脸颊也因为烦恼和屈辱而烧得越厉害。我又上了马车，疲惫不堪地往后一靠。这时我想起来了，在一连串黑暗和光明的时间过去的时候，我已完全忘却了我叔叔约翰·爱写给里德太太的信，忘了他要收养我，让我成为他遗产继承人的打算。“如果我有那么一点儿独立财产的话，”我想，“说真的，那也许会好得多。我实在不能忍受罗切斯特先生把我打扮成玩偶一样，或者像第二个达那厄[11]那样坐着，每天让金雨洒遍全身。我一到家就要写信到马德里，告诉我叔叔约翰我要结婚了以及和谁结婚。只要我想到将来有一天能给罗切斯特先生带来一笔新增的财产，那自己现在由他供养，也会好受一点。”这么一想，心里便感到有些宽慰（这个想法当天我就去实施了），也就敢于再次直视我主人兼恋人的目光。这时他的目光正在固执地搜寻着我的，尽管我一直避开他的面容和目光。他微笑了。我想他的微笑大概正像一个苏丹王在欣喜和多情的时刻，对一个他刚慷慨赠予金银财宝的女奴似的。他的手一直在找寻我的手，我使劲握了它一下，然后把他这只被紧握得发红的手推了回去。

“你别那么神气，”我说，“如果你这样的话，那我就只穿我那身洛伍德学校的旧衣服，别的都不穿。结婚的时候我穿那套淡紫色格子布衣服——你自己尽可以用珠灰色丝绸做一件晨衣，用黑色的缎子做无数件背心。”

他笑了起来，搓着手。“呵，看她那样子，听她说话真有趣！”他大声叫了起来，“她还不够古怪、泼辣吗？我绝不愿意用这个英国小姑娘去换土耳其王后宫的全部嫔妃，即使她们有羚羊般的眼睛、女神般的身体！”

这个东方式的比喻又一次刺痛了我。“我根本比不了你那些后宫中的嫔妃，”我说，“所以你就别把我同她们相提并论。如果你喜欢这类东西，先生，你还是赶快到伊斯坦布尔的市场上去，把你不知道该怎么花才好的钱全都拿出来购买大批的奴隶吧。”

“珍妮特，在我为无数吨肉和各类黑眼睛讨价还价时，你会干什么？”

“我会收拾行装，出去当个传教士，向那些被奴役的人——包括你那些后宫嫔妃们宣扬自由。我会到你的后宫，鼓动造反。而你呢，即使你是三尾帕夏[12]，转眼之间，也会被我们的人戴上镣铐，除非你签署一份宪章，有史以来的专制君王所签发的最宽容的宪章，否则是不会同意释放你的。”

“我会甘愿听你摆布，盼你开恩，简。”

“如果你用这种目光恳求，罗切斯特先生，我不会开恩。我敢肯定，只要你是这样一副神态，无论强迫你同意哪种宪章，你获释后要干的第一件事，就是破坏它的条款。”

“嗨，简，你究竟要干什么？恐怕除了圣坛前的结婚仪式之外，你一定要我再举行一次秘密的婚礼吧。看得出来，你还要规定一些特殊的条件——是些什么条件呢？”

“我只求内心的安宁，先生，而不被数不清的恩惠压得透不过气来。你还记得你是怎么说塞莉纳·瓦伦的吗？——说你送给她的钻石和毛料？我不会做你英国的塞莉纳·瓦伦。我会继续当阿德拉的家庭教师，挣得我的食宿，以及三十英镑的年薪，我会用这笔钱购置自己的衣服，你什么也不要给我，除了……”

“嗯，除了什么？”

“你的尊重。而我也报之以我的尊重，这样我们就互不相欠了。”

“嘿，要论起天生的冷漠无礼和过分自尊，再没有人能比得上你了。”他说。这时我们驶近了桑菲尔德。“你愿意今天和我一起吃饭吗？”我们驶进大门时，他问。

“不，谢谢你，先生。”

“为什么说‘不，谢谢你’呢？如果我可以问问的话。”

“我从来没有和你一起吃过饭，先生。也看不出有什么理由现在要这样做，除非到——”

“到什么呀？你总是欲言又止。”

“一直等到我不得不这样做的时候。”

“难道你把我想成吃起饭来像吃人的魔王或者食尸的妖怪，所以你害怕和我一起吃饭？”

“关于这点，我没有那样的想象，先生，但是我希望再像往常一样过上一个月。”

“你应该马上放弃家庭教师这份苦差使。”

“说真的，请原谅，先生，我不放弃。我还是像往常一样整天不和你见面；如果晚上你想见我了，可以派人来叫我，我会来的，但别的时候不行。”

“在这种情况下，简，我想吸支烟，或者撮鼻烟，安慰安慰自己，像阿德拉会说的‘装作不在乎的样子[13]’。但不幸的是，我既没有带雪茄烟盒，也没有带鼻烟壶。可是听着——悄悄同你说——现在由你得意，小暴君，不过我的日子很快就会来了：一旦我完全抓住了你，我就会——打个比方——把你紧紧地拴在一根链条上不放（摸了摸他的表链）。是的，美丽的小仙女，我要把你揣在怀里，免得失落了我的宝贝。”

他一边说一边扶我下了马车，当他接着去抱阿德拉下来时，我乘机进了屋，溜到了楼上。

傍晚时他准时把我叫了过去。我事先已想好了事情让他做，因为我不想整个晚上都花在和他说悄悄话儿上。我记得他的嗓子很好，还知道他喜欢唱歌——唱得好的人一般都这样。而且按照他那种苛刻的标准，我既不会唱歌，也不会演奏。但是我喜欢看出色的表演。薄暮的浪漫时刻，刚刚在窗外垂下了它缀满星星的蓝色旗子，我就站起身来，打开钢琴，恳求他一定给我唱首歌。他说我是个爱恶作剧的女巫，说他宁愿在别的时候唱，但我一口咬定说没有比现在更合适的了。

他问我：喜欢他的嗓子吗？

“非常喜欢。”我本来不想纵容他敏感的虚荣心，不过就这么一次，而且又出于目前的需要，我甚至会迎合和怂恿这样的虚荣心。

“那么，简，你得给我伴奏。”

“很好，先生，我试试。”

我确实试了。但没过多久，就被赶下了琴凳，而且被叫做“笨手笨脚的小东西”。他毫无礼貌地把我推到了一旁——这正是我希望的，他坐在了我的位置上，开始自己伴奏起来，因为他既能唱歌又能弹琴。我赶紧走向窗子的凹处，坐了下来，望着窗外沉寂的树木和朦胧的草地，听他用圆润的嗓音，在优美的旋律下，唱起了下面的歌：





炽热如火的心底，

感受到最真诚的爱情，

它把生命的热潮，

欢快地注入了每根血管。



每天，她的来临是我的希望，

她的离去是我的痛苦。

偶尔她意外地姗姗来迟，

我的每根血管就像结成了冰块。



我梦想，爱别人也为别人所爱，

是一种莫名的幸福。

朝着这个目标我向前赶路，

心情急切，又十分盲目。



谁知在我们两人之间，

还横亘着无路的荒漠。

犹如翻江倒海的绿波，

湍急又危险。



犹如盗贼出没的小径，

穿过山林和荒漠。

强权和公理、忧伤和愤怒，

使我们的心灵相隔。



艰难险阻，我毫不畏惧，

种种凶兆，我视若无睹。

一切骚扰、警告和威胁，

我都漠然处之。



我的彩虹如闪电般疾驰，

我在梦中飞翔。

因为在我的眼前光辉出现了，

雨过天晴的曙光。



温柔庄严的欢乐依旧辉煌，

照耀着灰暗苦难的朦胧云雾。

尽管阴森险恶的灾难已经逼近，

如今，我已毫不在乎。



我已冲过重重的险阻，

在这甜蜜的时刻我已无所顾忌。

哪怕险阻会再度展翅迅猛袭击，

宣布要无情地报复。



尽管傲慢的憎恨会把我击倒，

公理不容我上前分辩。

残暴的强权更满面怒容，

发誓与我不共戴天。



我心爱的人儿，怀着崇高的真诚，

把她的小手放在我的手里。

宣誓让婚姻的神圣纽带，

把我们两人紧紧系在一起。



我心爱的人儿用矢志不渝的一吻，

发誓与我生死同受。

我终于得到了无法形容的幸福，

我爱别人——也为别人所爱。





他站起身，向我走来。我看见他满脸都燃烧着热情的火焰，睁大的鹰眼闪闪发光，脸上到处流露着温柔与激情。我一时感到有些畏缩——但随后又振作起来了。柔情的场面、大胆的表示，都不是我希望发生的。但现在我处在这两种危险之中。我必须准备好防御的武器——我磨利了我的口齿，等他一走近，我就粗声粗气地问道：“他现在究竟要和谁结婚？”

“我亲爱的简提出了一个这么奇怪的问题。”

“真的！我认为这是个很自然很必要的问题，他谈到他的未婚妻和他一起死，他提出这样的异教徒想法是什么意思？我可不想和他一起死——他不用怀疑这一点。”

“哦，他渴望的、他祈祷的是你和他一起活！死亡可不属于像你这样的人。”

“当然也是属于我的，和他一样，我的时候一到，我也有权利去死。不过我要静待天年，而不是自焚殉夫，匆匆了此一生。”

“你肯原谅他这种自私的想法，给他一个吻，表示原谅和和解吗？”

“不，我看还是免了吧。”

这时我听见他称我为“心如铁石的小东西”，接着又听道：“如果是别的女人，听了这样的歌，肯定都感动到骨头里了。”

我明确地告诉他，我天生就是硬心肠——硬得像石头，他会发现我经常如此。还说我决定在以后的四周里，让他看看我性格中倔犟的一面。他应当非常明白，他订的是怎样的婚约，趁现在还来得及取消。

“你愿意心平气和、合情合理说话吗？”

“如果你喜欢的话，我会心平气和的；至于说话合情合理，那不是自我恭维，我现在就是这么做的。”

他很恼火，嘴里又是呸又是啐的。“很好，”我想，“你发火也好，烦躁也好，我相信，这是对付你的最好办法。尽管我对你的喜欢，已经无法用言语来表达，但是我不愿落入多愁善感的流俗，我要用这巧辩的锋芒，让你也不至于陷进去。而且还要凭借它刺痛的帮助，在你我之间保持着对彼此都有利的距离。”

我得寸进尺，惹得他很恼火，随后趁他悻悻地快要走到屋子另一头的时候，站起来像往常那样自自然然，恭恭敬敬地说了声“祝您晚安，先生”，便从边门溜掉了。

开始采取的这种办法，我在整个试探期都一直用着，而且大获成功。当然他时常有点愠怒，但总的说来，他的心情不错。而绵羊般的顺从、斑鸠似的多情，一方面会助长他的专横，另一方面也不见得能像现在这样取悦他的理智，满足他的理智，甚至适合他的趣味。

别人在场的时候，我还和以前一样显得恭敬文雅，没有必要有其他的举动。只有在晚上谈话的时候，才那么阻挠他，折磨他。他仍然是钟一敲七点便准时把我叫去，不过在他跟前时，他不再满嘴“亲爱的”、“宝贝儿”这一类的甜蜜称呼了。用在我身上最好的词是“令人恼火的木偶”、“恶毒的小精灵”、“小妖精”、“丑八怪”等等。而且，我得到的不是抚慰，而是鬼脸；不是紧紧握手，而是拧一下胳膊；不是吻一下脸颊，而是使劲拉拉耳朵。这没什么。现在我确实更喜欢这种粗暴的宠爱，而不喜欢什么温柔的表示。我发现费尔法克斯太太也赞成，她已不再为我担忧了，因此我更相信自己做得很对。与此同时，罗切斯特先生却口口声声说我把他折磨得只剩皮包骨头了，并威胁在即将到来的那个时期，对我现在的行为狠狠报复。对于他的恐吓，我暗自好笑。“现在我可以把你合乎情理地约束住，”我想，“我并不怀疑今后还能这么做。如果一种办法失效了，那就得另外再想出一种来。”

然而，我的工作毕竟不轻松，我常常愿意讨他喜欢而不是捉弄他。我的未婚夫正成为我的整个世界，还不仅仅是整个世界，而几乎成了我进入天堂的希望。他简直让我顾不得再去想宗教观念，犹如日食让人看不到太阳一样。在那些日子里，因为上帝创造的人，我看不到上帝，我把他当成了我的偶像。

第二十五章


求婚的一个月过去了，只剩下了最后几个小时了；快要来临的那个日子——结婚的日子不会推迟。一切准备工作也已就绪，至少我手头没有别的事儿要干了。我的箱子已收拾停当，锁好，捆好，沿小房间的墙根排成排。明天这个时候它们将要被送往遥远的伦敦，当然还有我（上帝应允的话），或者不是我，而是一个叫简·罗切斯特的人，这个人我目前尚不认识。只有地址标签还没贴上，那四个小方块仍躺在抽屉里。罗切斯特先生亲自在每个标签上书写了“伦敦旅馆罗切斯特太太收”这几个字。我无法让自己或者别人把它们贴上去。罗切斯特太太！她并不存在，要到明天八点钟后的某个时候才降生。我得等到完全相信她已经活生生地来到这个世界时，才把那份财产划归她。在我梳妆台对面的衣柜里，一些据说是她的衣物，已经取代了她洛伍德的黑呢上衣和草帽。这已经足够了，因为那套婚礼服，以及垂挂在临时占用的钩子上的珠白色长袍和薄雾似的面纱，本不属于她。我关上了衣柜，隐去了里面幽灵似的奇装异服。在晚间九点这个时辰，这些衣着在我房间的暗影里，发出了阴森森的微光。“我要让你独个儿留着，白色的梦幻。”我说。我兴奋难耐，我听见风在劲吹，我到外面吹吹风吧。

使我兴奋的不仅是匆匆忙忙的结婚准备，也不仅是因为对巨大的变化——明天开始的新生活所怀的希望。毫无疑问，两者都起了作用，使我兴奋不安，这么晚了还匆匆来到越来越黑的庭园。但是第三个原因对我的心理影响更大。

我心里有一种陌生而又焦虑的想法。一定发生了什么我无法理解的事情，除了我，没有人知道这件事情，也没有看见过。这事发生在婚礼前一天的晚上。那天晚上罗切斯特先生没有在家，并且一晚上都没有回家。他因为有事到三十英里外的两三个小农庄去了——这些事务需要他在计划离开英国之前亲自去办理。此刻我等着他回来，急于卸去心头的包袱，请他解开困惑着我的谜。我要待到他回来，读者，我一向他倾诉我的秘密，你们也就不言自明了。

我朝果园走去，被风吹到了果园安全的地方；南风强劲地刮了一整天，而没有带来一滴雨。随着夜晚的来临，风不但没有小，反而更加撒欢似的奔跑着，深沉地咆哮着；树木被风吹得只往一个方向摇摆，在一个小时内几乎就没有改变过方向；树梢被劲风绷得统统向北弯腰，云块从这儿飘到那儿，接连不断。那个七月的日子，看不到一丝蓝天。

奔跑于风中，任自己烦乱的思绪随呼啸穿空的无尽气流吹散，倒也很值得欢喜。我走下月桂路，看见了七叶树的悲惨；它站在那里，颜色漆黑，裂成两半；树干从中间被劈开，在那儿可怕地喘息着。裂开的两半却并未七零八散，因为坚实的树根把它们联结到一块，虽然生命的完整已经被破坏，树液无法流动，巨大的树枝已经枯死。这年冬天的暴风雪一定会将它们或它压倒在地上。但它仍然可以称为一棵树，只不过它是一棵死树。

“你们这样相互依存，确实很对。”我说，仿佛这两块离开的树干是有生命的，它们可以听到我说话似的，“虽然你们满身是伤，像炭一样黑，但还有一线生机，从那忠实正直的树根结合处长出。你们不会再吐绿叶，也不会再目睹小鸟筑巢、歌唱。欢乐与相爱的时光已经离你们远去，但你们并不孤独，相濡以沫。”抬头仰望这棵树，刹那间，月亮恰好在裂缝中间的那片天空上出现，圆圆的月亮只看见一半，颜色血红。她仿佛迷惑忧伤地看了我一眼，立即又躲进厚厚的云层。一瞬间桑菲尔德四周风势越来越弱，但远处树林和水面上，却响起狂乱悲伤的哀号，听起来让人心寒，我拔腿就跑。

我一个人在果园里溜达，把树根周围厚厚的青草底下的苹果捡起来，随后就专心致志地把成熟的苹果和不成熟的区分开来，把它们拿进房间里，放进贮藏室。接着我就去书房看看火炉里的火是否还燃烧着；虽然时值夏天，但我想在这样一个阴沉的夜晚，当罗切斯特先生回来的时候，一定希望火炉里的火烧得旺旺的。火已经着了有一段时间了，火势很旺。我把他的安乐椅放在炉角，把桌子推近它。我放下窗帘，让人送来蜡烛，以备点灯。

这一切都安排好以后，我很有些坐立不安，甚至连屋子里也待不住了。房间里的小钟和厅里的老钟同时敲响了十点。

“这么晚了！”我自言自语地说，“我要到楼下的大门口去，借着微暗的月光，我能看清楚门口的路。这会儿也许他正在回来的路上，出去迎接他可以省去几分钟的担心。”

风在遮掩着大门的巨树中咆哮着；但是我使劲地往远处看，看看左边，看看右边，路上静悄悄的，甚至有些孤寂，只有云的阴影不时掠过。月亮探出头来时，也不过是苍白的一长条，单调得连一个移动的斑点都没有。

在我东张西望的时候，不争气的眼泪模糊了我的双眼，这是失望和不耐烦的眼泪；我感到很惭愧，于是赶紧把它拭去。我还在门口徘徊，月亮把自己完全藏进了她的房子里，并且把厚厚的云彩做的窗帘也一并拉上了。夜深了，骤雨随着大风降下。

“希望他会回来！希望他会回来！”我大嚷着，内心被抑郁症的预感所缠绕。我本来以为他在晚茶之前可以回来，可是现在天已经黑了。是什么事情让他脱不开身呢？发生了什么事情呢？昨天晚上的一幕又在我脑海中重现，我把它看成了一种厄运的征兆。我担心自己的希望过于光明而不可能实现，最近我享了那么多福，自己不免想到，我的运气已过了顶点，如今必然要走下坡路了。

“是的，我不能回屋去，”我思忖道，“当他在这么恶劣的天气里在外不归的时候，我不能够安心坐在火炉边，与其让我的精神紧张，还不如让我四肢劳累一下的好。我应该向前走走去迎接他。”

我开始向前走，走得很快，但没走多远，我估计大约走了四分之一英里的时候，我便听见了一阵马蹄声。一位骑手疾驰而来，旁边跟着一条狗。不祥的预感一扫而光！这正是他，骑在梅斯罗上的正是他，身后跟着派洛特。他看见了我，因为月亮在空中开辟了一条蓝色的光带，在光带中飘移，晶莹透亮。他摘下帽子，在头顶挥动，我迎着他跑了上去。

“瞧！”他大声叫道，一面伸出双手，从马鞍上弯下腰来，“看来你少了我不行，这是很显然的事情。踩在我靴子尖上，把两只手都给我，上来！”

我照他说的做了。心里一高兴身手也矫捷了许多。我跳上马，坐到他前面。他使劲吻我，表示对我的欢迎，随后又自鸣得意地吹了一番，我尽量一股脑儿都相信。得意之中他刹住话题问我：“发生什么事情了吗，珍妮特？你怎么这个时候出来接我？出了什么事了？”

“没有。不过我以为你永远都不会回来了。我实在不能忍受在屋子里面等你，尤其是在这个风雨交加的夜晚。”

“确实雨大风疾！是呀，看你淋得像美人鱼一样。把我的斗篷拉过去盖上。不过我想你有些发烧，简。你的脸颊和手都烫得厉害。我再问一句，出了什么事了吗？”

“现在没有。我既不害怕也不担忧。”

“你的意思是说你刚才害怕过，发愁过了？”

“有一些，不过等一会儿慢慢地我会告诉你的，先生。我猜想你只会讥笑我自寻烦恼。”

“等明天一过，我会痛痛快快地笑话你，但现在可不敢。我的奖品还不一定到手呢。上个月你就像鳗鱼一样狡猾，像玫瑰一样多刺，什么地方手指一碰就挨了刺。现在我好像已经把迷途的羔羊揽在怀里了，你溜出羊栏来找你的牧羊人啦，简？”

“我需要你。别吹嘘了，我们已经到了桑菲尔德了，让我下去吧。”

他把我放到了石子路上。约翰把马牵走了，他跟在我后头进了大厅，告诉我赶快换上干衣服，然后到书房找他。我正向楼梯走去，他拦住我，硬要我答应不要磨蹭太久。我确实没有待多久，五分钟后我便回到了他身边，这时他正在用晚饭。

“简，坐下来陪陪我；如果上帝保佑的话，在很长一段时间内，这是你在桑菲尔德吃的倒数第二顿饭了。”

我在他旁边坐下，告诉他我已经吃不下了。“简，难道你在担心前面的旅程吗？还是因为想着去伦敦没有胃口了？”

“先生，我今天晚上突然看不清楚我的未来了，我几乎都不知道我脑袋里想的是什么；生活中的一切似乎都是不现实的，是虚幻的。”

“除了我。我非常的真实——摸我一下试试看。”

“先生，你最像幻影了，你只不过是个梦。”

他伸出手，边靠近我的眼睛，边笑道：“这是一个梦吗？”他的手浑圆、强劲有力、十分匀称，他的胳膊又长又壮实。

“是的，是一个梦，尽管我触摸到了它。”说着把他的手从我面前按下去，“先生，你吃完晚饭了吗？”

“是的，简。”

我打了铃，吩咐下人把托盘拿走。当我们两个人再次单独在一起的时候，我拨了拨火，在我主人膝边找了个低矮的位置坐下。

“快半夜了。”我说。

“不错，但记住，简，你答应过在婚礼前夜陪我一起守夜的。”

“我的确答应过，而且我会信守承诺，至少陪你一两个小时，我不想睡觉。”

“你都准备好了吗？”

“准备好了，先生。”

“我也准备好了，”他说，“我什么都处理好了，明天从教堂一回来，半小时之内我们就离开桑菲尔德。”

“很好，先生。”

“你说‘很好’两个字的时候，笑得真有些反常，简！你双颊上的一小块多亮！你眼睛里的闪光多怪呀！你还好吧？”

“我相信很好。”

“相信！怎么回事？告诉我你的感受。”

“我不能告诉你我现在的感受，因为我的感受是不能用言语表达的。我只是希望此时此刻永远都不会结束。谁知道下一个钟头的命运会怎样呢？”

“这是忧郁症的表现啊。简，这段时间你太兴奋，也太劳累了。”

“你觉得平静而幸福吗，先生？”

“平静？不，但很幸福，幸福到了心窝里。”

我抬起头看着他，读着他脸上幸福的表情；这是一张真诚而涨得通红的脸。

“简，把你的秘密告诉我吧。”他说，“跟我说说你内心的顾虑，释放一下吧。你担心什么呢？怕我不是个好丈夫？”

“我从未如此想过。”

“那就是为你即将踏入的新环境担心？也就是你即将要过的新生活？”

“不是。”

“你把我弄糊涂了，简。你那忧伤而大胆的目光和语气，使我困惑，也使我痛苦。我要求你解释一下。”

“那么，先生，听着。昨天晚上你是不是不在家？”

“是的。我知道你不久前曾经暗示，我不在的时候发生了一些事情，我想也没什么严重的。但它却扰乱了你的心绪，说给我听听吧。是不是费尔法克斯太太说了什么？还是你听到用人们谈论了什么，使你那敏感的自尊心受到了伤害？”

“没有，先生。”这时正敲十二点。我等到小钟响过清脆和谐的声音，大钟停止沙哑的震荡才继续说下去：

“昨天一整天我都很忙碌，这样无休止的忙碌我觉得很幸福；并不像你想象的那样，我为新天地之类的忧虑而烦恼。我认为怀着和你一起生活的希望是幸福的，因为我爱你。不要，先生，现在请不要抚摸我，让我继续把话说完。昨天，我相信上苍，相信对你我来说一切都会很顺利。你总还记得，那是个晴朗的日子，天空那么宁静，你旅途的平安和舒适丝毫不会引起我的牵挂。晚茶过后，我在石子路上散了一会儿步，心里想着你。在思念中，我感觉你离我很近，几乎就在我眼前。我思忖着展现在我面前的生活——你的生活，先生——比我的更奢华，更激动人心，就像容纳了江河的大海深处，与海峡的浅滩相比，有天壤之别。我觉得奇怪，为什么道德学家称这个世界为凄凉的荒漠，对我来说，它好像盛开的玫瑰。就在夕阳西下的时候，天气转冷，乌云布满了天空，我便进屋去了。索菲叫我上楼去看看刚买的婚礼服，在礼服下面的盒子里，我看见了你的礼物，是你叫人从伦敦专程送来的面纱，你真是像王子一样阔绰。我猜想你肯定是因为我不愿要某件珠宝而决意哄我接受某种同样昂贵的东西。我打开面纱，会心地笑了笑，想着我怎样来嘲弄你的贵族气派，取笑你刻意要给你的平民新娘戴上贵族的假面的用心。我想象着自己如何把那块早已准备好遮盖自己卑微出身而没有绣花的花边方丝巾拿下来，问问你，对一个既无法给她的丈夫带来财富，也没有美色，也无法给他带来社会关系的女人，是不是已经足够了。我清清楚楚地看到了你的表情，听到了你激烈而开明的回答，听到你高傲地否认仰仗与金钱和桂冠结亲来增加自己的财富或者提高自己地位的必要性的断言。”

“你把我看得真透，你这个女巫！”罗切斯特先生插嘴道，“但除了刺绣之外，你到底还在面纱里发现了什么，你是见到了毒药，还是匕首，弄得现在这么愁眉苦脸？”

“没有，没有，先生。除了织品的精致和华丽以及费尔法克斯·罗切斯特的傲慢，我什么也没有看到。他的傲慢可吓不倒我，因为我已经习惯了。可是，先生，天越来越黑，风也越来越大了。昨天的风不像现在这样强劲肆虐，而是沉闷的低吟声，显得十分古怪。我真希望你还在家里。我走进这个房间，一见到空空荡荡的椅子和冷冰冰的炉子，心便凉了半截。上床以后，我因为激动不安而忧心忡忡，久久不能入睡。风势越来越大，在我听来，它似乎裹挟着一阵低声的哀鸣。这声音来自屋内还是户外，起初我无法辨认，但后来又响了起来，每次间歇听上去模糊而悲哀。最后我终于确信那一定是远处的狗叫声。后来声音消失了，我的心情也好起来了。但一睡着，又继续梦见月黑风高的夜晚，继续盼着能和你在一起，并且奇怪而遗憾地意识到，我们被某种障碍隔开了。刚睡着的时候，我梦见自己沿着一条弯曲的陌生路走着，四周黑糊糊一片，雨点肆意地打在我身上，我抱着一个孩子，疲惫不堪，不堪重负。一个孩子，年纪太小，身体又弱，不能走路，在我冰冷的怀抱里颤抖，在我耳旁悲哀地哭泣。先生，你远远地走在我前面，我使出吃奶的力气要赶上你，一次次奋力叫着你的名字，央求你停下来，但我的行动被束缚着，我的嗓音渐渐地沉下去，变得模糊不清，而你，离我越来越远了。”

“简，我现在就在你身边，这些梦还困扰着你的灵魂吗？神经质的小东西！忘掉梦幻中的不幸，享受现实中的幸福吧！说你爱我，珍妮特。不错，那我不会忘记，你也不能否认。这些话并没有在你嘴边模糊不清地消失。我听来既清晰又温柔。也许这个想法过于严肃了，但却像音乐一样甜蜜：‘我想怀有同你一起生活的希望是幸福的，因为我爱你。’你爱我吗，简？再说一遍。”

“我爱你，先生，我爱你，全身心地爱你。”

“好了，”他沉默片刻后说，“真奇怪，听了那句话，我的心在隐隐作痛。为什么呢？也许是因为你说得那么虔诚，那么富有力量，因为你抬眼看我时，目光里透出了极度的信赖、真诚和忠心。那太崇高了，仿佛在我身边的是某个神灵。摆出凶相来吧，简，你很明白该怎么摆。装出任性、腼腆、挑衅的笑容来，告诉我你恨我——戏弄我，惹怒我吧，什么都行，就是别打动我。我宁愿发疯而不愿哀伤。”

“等我把故事讲完，我会戏弄你，惹怒你，让你心满意足的，现在听我把故事讲完吧。”

“我想，简，你已经把一切都告诉我了，我认为我已经发现你的忧郁全因为一个梦！”

我摇了摇头。

“什么！还有别的！但我不相信能有什么了不起的事情。我有言在先，我对你说的话表示怀疑，继续说吧。”

他神态不安，举止有些忧虑焦躁。我很惊奇，但我还是继续说下去了：

“我还做了另外一个奇怪的梦，先生。梦见桑菲尔德庄园是一处凄凉的废墟，成了蝙蝠和猫头鹰的栖息地。富丽堂皇的正墙只剩下一道贝壳似的残壁，很高大也很单薄。在一个有月亮的晚上，我在这杂草丛生的围墙中徘徊。不是这儿被大理石火炉绊倒，就是撞到了落地的檐板。我披着一块披肩，怀里始终抱着那个来路不明的孩子；尽管我的胳膊很累，但我不能把他放下；无论多累，我都要带着他。一阵马蹄声从远处传来，我想那肯定是你，你离开我已经好多年了，你去了一个遥远的地方。我发疯似的爬那单薄的残壁，想从上面看你一眼。突然脚下的石头滚落下来，抓住的那根常春藤也突然断开，怀中的孩子恐惧地搂紧了我的脖子，我快要窒息了。好不容易爬到了墙顶，却见你就像一个小人儿，越来越小。风依然刮得那么强劲，人站都站不住。我索性在墙头坐了下来，安慰一下怀中受惊吓的孩子。你拐弯了，我俯身想看个究竟，没想到墙倒了，我一摇晃，孩子从我腿上滚了下去，我也失去平衡，跌了下来，随后我就醒过来了。”

“简，你现在讲完了吧。”

“这只是序幕，先生，故事才刚刚开始。当我醒来的时候，一股强光让我眼花缭乱。我当时就想，哦，那是日光；但是我立即意识到我错了，那只不过是烛光。我想肯定是索菲进来了。梳妆台上有一盏灯，而衣橱门大开着，睡觉前我曾把我的婚礼服和面纱放进橱里。我听见了一阵窸窸窣窣的声音。我就问：‘索菲，你在干什么呢？’没有人回答。但是从衣橱里面钻出一个人影来。只见它拿着蜡烛，擎得很高，并且仔细端详着从架子上垂下来的衣服。‘索菲！索菲！’我又叫了起来，但它依然没有出声。我从床上坐起来，俯身向前。我先是感到吃惊，继而迷惑不解。我血管里的血也冷了。罗切斯特先生，它不是索菲，不是莉娅，也不是费尔法克斯太太。它不是……不，我当时很肯定，现在也很肯定——甚至也不是那个奇怪的女人格雷斯·普尔太太。”

“肯定是她们中的一个。”主人打断了我的话。

“不，先生，我庄严地向你保证，我想的和你说的恰恰相反。站在我面前的人影，我以前从来没有在桑菲尔德见过；它的身高、体形对我来说很陌生。”

“描绘一下吧，简。”

“先生，它似乎是一个女人，又高又大，披散着粗黑的长发；我不知道她穿了什么衣服，反正又白又整齐。但究竟是袍子、被单，还是裹尸布，我说不上来。”

“简，那你看见她的脸了吗？”

“刚开始没有。但她立刻把我的面纱从原来的地方取下来，拿起来呆呆地看了很久，随后往自己头上一盖，转身照镜子。那一刹那，在暗淡的鸭蛋形镜子里，我清清楚楚地看到了她的面容与五官。”

“是什么样子？”

“我觉得很吓人，像鬼一样。哦，先生，我从来没有见过这样的面孔！没有血色，还满脸凶气。但愿我忘掉那双骨碌碌转的红眼睛，那副黑乎乎的鬼相！”

“鬼魂的脸总是苍白的，简。”

“不，先生，它的脸却是紫色的。它的嘴唇又肿又黑，额头上布满皱纹，布满血丝的眼睛上面竖立着眉毛。我可以告诉你我想起什么了吗？”

“可以。”

“想起了可恶的德国幽灵——吸血鬼。”

“啊！它究竟干了什么？”

“先生，她把我的面纱从她憔悴的头上扯下来，撕成两半，然后把它扔在地上，用脚使劲踩。”

“那后来呢？”

“后来她拉开窗帘，往外张望。也许她看到天快亮时，便拿着蜡烛朝房门走去。这个身影在我的床边停了下来。火一般的目光向我射来，她把蜡烛举起来靠近我的脸，在我眼皮底下把它吹灭了。我感到她白煞煞的脸朝我闪着光，我昏了过去。平生第二次——只不过第二次——我吓昏了。”

“你醒过来时跟谁在一起？”

“除了看到大白天，先生，谁也没有。我起床用水冲了一下头和脸，喝了一大口水，觉得身子虽然虚弱，却没有生病，便决定除了你，对谁都不说这噩梦的事儿。好了，现在先生，请你告诉我这女人是谁，干什么的？”

“显然那是头脑过于兴奋的产物。我必须要小心翼翼地看护你，我的宝贝，像你这样的神经，是经不住粗暴对待的。”

“先生，毫无疑问，我的神经没有毛病，那件事情是真的，事情确实发生了。”

“那么你以前的梦呢，也都是真的吗？桑菲尔德庄园毁了吗？你我被不可逾越的障碍隔开了吗？难道我没有流一滴眼泪，没有吻一吻你，没有说一句话就离开你了？”

“不，现在还没有。”

“你认为我以后会这么做吗？我们永久结合的日子马上就要到来了。等咱们结婚了，这种精神上的恐惧就再也不会有了，我保证。”

“精神恐惧！我真的希望是这样！既然连你都无法解释这件事情，现在我更希望只是精神恐惧了。”

“既然我都无法解释，简，那就一定不会是真的。”

“但是，先生，当我今天早晨起床对我自己这么说的时候，当我环顾整个房间，想从大白天每件熟悉的东西愉悦的外形上找到一点勇气和慰藉的时候，我在地毯上看见的东西完全否定了我的假设，那就是被撕成两半的面纱。”

我发觉罗切斯特先生大吃一惊，打了个寒战，急急忙忙搂住我脖子。“谢天谢地！”他嚷道，“幸好昨晚你所遇到的险情，不过就是毁了面纱——哎呀。”

他喘着粗气，紧紧地搂住我，差点让我透不过气来。沉默片刻之后，他兴致十足地说下去：

“珍妮特，我现在向你解释事情的全部。这一半是梦，一半是真。我并不怀疑确实有个女人进了你房间，那女人就是——肯定是——格雷斯·普尔。你自己不也把她叫做怪人吗？你有理由这么叫她，瞧她怎么对待我的？怎么对待梅森的？在似睡非睡的状态下，你注意到她进了房间，看到了她的行动，但由于你兴奋得几乎发狂，你把她当成了不同于她本来面貌的鬼相。散乱的长发、黑黑的肿脸、夸大了的身材是你的臆想、噩梦的产物。恶狠狠撕毁面纱倒是真的，很像她干的事。我明白你会问：干吗在屋里养着这样一个女人？等我们结婚一周年时，我会告诉你，而不是现在。你满意了吗，简？你同意对这个谜的解释吗？”

我想了一想，对我来说实在也只能这么解释了，说满意那倒未必，但为了使他高兴，我尽力装出这副样子来——说感到宽慰却是真的，于是我对他报以满意的微笑。这时早过了一点钟，我准备向他告辞了。

“索菲不是和阿德拉一起睡在育儿室吗？”我点起蜡烛时，他问。

“是的，先生。”

“阿德拉的小床还能睡得下你，今晚得跟她一起睡，简。你说的事情会使你神经紧张，那也毫不奇怪。我倒情愿你不要单独睡，答应我到育儿室去。”

“我很乐意这样做，先生。”

“从里面把门闩牢。上楼的时候叫醒索菲，麻烦她明天早上及时把你叫醒，因为你得在八点前穿好衣服，吃完早饭。现在别再那么忧心忡忡了，抛开沉重的烦恼，珍妮特。你难道没有听见轻风的细语？雨点不再敲打窗户，瞧（他撩起窗帘），多么可爱的夜晚！”

确实如此。半个天空都明净如水。此刻，风已改由西面吹来，轻云在风前疾驰，朝东排列成长长的银色圆柱，月亮洒下了宁静的光辉。

“好吧。”罗切斯特先生说，一边带着探询的目光窥视我。“这会儿我的珍妮特怎么样了？”

“夜晚非常平静，先生，我也一样。”

“明天除了欢乐的爱和幸福的结合，你再也不会梦见分离和悲伤了。”

这一预见只实现了一半。我的确没有梦见忧伤，但也没有梦见欢乐，因为我根本就没有睡着。我搂着阿德拉，瞧着孩子沉沉睡去——那么平静，那么安宁，那么天真，等待着明天即将升起的太阳。我的整个生命都在心中苏醒了，在我躯体内躁动着。太阳刚一出来，我便起来了，我记得离开阿德拉时她紧紧搂住我，我记得把她的小手从我脖子上松开的时候，我吻了吻她。我怀着一种莫名的情感对着她哭了起来，赶紧离开了她，生怕哭泣声会惊动她的酣睡。看到她，我仿佛就见到了昨天的自己；而他，我此刻梳妆打扮前去会面的那个人，既可怕而又亲切，却代表了不可预测的未来。





第二十六章


七点钟的时候索菲过来帮我梳妆打扮，花费了好长时间终于大功告成。时间那么长，罗切斯特先生差人来问我为什么还没有到，我想可能是因为对我的迟迟未去有点不耐烦的缘故吧。索菲刚把面纱（到底还是那一块淡色的普通方巾）用饰针别到我头发上，我就尽可能迅速地从她的手底下逃了出来。

“慢着！”她用法语喊道，“看一下镜子里的你吧，你连一眼都还没有看呢。”

于是我从门口转过身来，看到了一个穿长袍戴面纱的人站立在镜子里，和平时的我判若两人，就仿佛是一位陌生人。“简！”外面传来呼唤我的声音，我赶忙下楼，正好在楼梯下面遇见罗切斯特先生。

“磨磨蹭蹭的家伙，”他喊道，“我的耐心已经被磨光了，你怎么耽搁这么久！”

他带我进了餐厅，用他一贯锐利的眼光把我从头到脚打量了一遍，称赞我“像百合花那么娇美，不单是他生活中的骄傲，而且也让他大饱眼福”。随后他告诉我只给我十分钟吃早饭，并按了按铃。他新雇用的仆人中的一位马夫应声而来。

“约翰把马车准备好了吗？”

“准备好了，先生。”

“行李搬下去了吗？”

“他们正在搬呢，先生。”

“去一趟教堂，看看沃德先生（牧师）和执事在不在，回来告诉我具体的情况。”

如读者所知，大门旁边就是教堂，所以马夫很快就回来了。

“先生，沃德先生在法衣室里，正忙着穿法衣呢。”

“马车准备得怎么样了？”

“正在上套具。”

“我们去教堂用不着马车，但是在我们回来的时候，一切必须都准备就绪：所有的箱子和行李都准备妥当和包扎好，马夫在座位上等待出发。”

“是，先生。”

“简，你准备好了吗？”

我站起来，没有伴郎和伴娘，也没有亲戚们的等候或引领。除了罗切斯特先生和我，再也没有别人。我们经过大厅时，费尔法克斯太太站在那里。我本想走上前和她说话，但我的手像被铁钳抓住似的，我被我几乎跟不上的大步催促着往前走。看到罗切斯特先生的脸，我就知道任何意图的些许耽搁都是不可容忍的。我不知道其他新郎是不是像他这样——那么专注于一个目的，那么毅然决然，或者有谁在那对稳重的眉毛下，露出过那么火辣辣、光闪闪的眼睛。

我搞不清楚那天天气是好还是不好，走下车道时，我既没望天也没看地，心灵与目光仿佛同时融进了罗切斯特先生的心里。我要瞧一瞧他凶狠的目光紧盯不放的那个无形物体，感觉他仿佛正在奋力抵抗种种念头。

在教堂院子边门旁他停了下来，他发现我已经上气不接下气了。“我的爱很残酷，对吗？”他问，“简，靠着我稍微休息一会儿吧。”

如今，我还能回忆起当时的情景：灰色的老教堂在我面前宁静地屹立着；一只白嘴鸦在教堂尖顶盘旋；远处的晨空被朝霞映得通红。我还隐约记得绿色的坟墩；也并没有忘记两个陌生的人影，在低矮的小丘之间徘徊，一边读着刻在几块长满青苔的墓石上的铭文。这两个人我确实注意到了，因为一见到我们，他们便转到教堂后面去了。我认为他们肯定是从侧廊的门进去观看仪式的。罗切斯特先生并没有注意到这两个人，他正热切地注视着我的脸。我想我的脸一时毫无血色，因为我觉得我额头汗涔涔，两颊和嘴唇冰凉。但我不久便回过神来，与他一起沿着小径向门廊走去。

我们进了肃静而略微简陋的教堂，牧师身穿白色的法衣，在低矮的圣坛等候，旁边站着执事。一切都十分平静，只有两个身影在远处的拐角处蠕动。我的猜测完全正确，那两个陌生人在我们之前溜了进来，此刻他们正站立在罗切斯特家族的墓穴旁，背对着我们，隔着栏杆在检视年深月久、污迹斑斑的大理石坟墓。那里一位下跪的天使正守卫着在内战中阵亡于马斯顿荒原的戴默尔·德·罗切斯特和他的妻子伊丽莎白的遗骸。

我们在圣餐台栏杆前站好。我听见身后有轻轻的脚步声，便回过头看了一眼，只见一个陌生人——显然是一位绅士——正在走上圣坛。仪式开始了，牧师对婚姻的目的作了解释，随后往前走了一步，向罗切斯特先生微微欠了欠身子，仪式继续。

“我要求并告诫你们两个人——因为在所有人内心所有的秘密都要袒露无遗的最后审判日，你们也将做出回答——如果你们两个人中的一位知道有什么障碍使你们不能合法结婚，那就现在供认吧；因为你们要确信，凡是众多没有得到上帝允许而结合的人，都不是由上帝结成的夫妇，他们的婚姻是非法的。”

按照惯例，他稍微停顿了一下。这句话之后的停顿，什么时候曾被回答所打破呢？不会的，也许一百年才有一次。因而牧师没有抬眼，依然盯着书，静默片刻之后又继续说下去。他的手一边伸向罗切斯特先生，一边问道：“你愿意娶这个女人做你的妻子吗？”话音未落，近处一个清晰的声音打断了牧师的问话：

“婚礼停止进行，我宣布存在着障碍。”

牧师抬头看了一下说话人，站在那里一言不发，执事也一样。罗切斯特先生稍微颤动了一下，仿佛地震从他脚下滚过，脚跟站稳后，头也不回，眼也不抬，说道：“继续。”

当听到罗切斯特先生深沉地说出这句话后，整个教堂一片寂静。沃德先生立即说：

“在对刚才所说事情的真伪做出调查之前，婚礼不能继续。”

“婚礼完全终止，”背后的嗓音补充道，“我能够证实我刚才的断言，这桩婚事存在着难以克服的障碍。”

罗切斯特先生听了之后并没有放在心上。他顽固而倔犟地站着，一动不动，只是握住了我的手。他的手是那么热烈而有力！那时，他那苍白、坚毅、宽阔的额头多像开采下来的大理石！他的眼睛多亮！多平静警觉！而眸子深处又是多么狂野！

沃德先生一时不知所措。“到底是哪一类性质的障碍？”他问。“说不定解释清楚就可以排除呢。”

“几乎不可能，”那人回答，“我称它是难以克服的障碍，是经过认真考虑的。”

说话者上前一步，倚在栏杆上。他继续往下说，他所说的每个字是那么清楚、镇定和稳重，但音调并不高：

“障碍其实很简单，就是罗切斯特先生此前有一次既成婚姻，并且他的妻子现在还活着。”

这句轻声道来的话，极大地震动了我的神经，而这种震动是雷电所不能及的。我的血液感受到了它们轻微的波动，而这种感觉却比以前感受过的烈火或霜冻还有过之而无不及。但我又镇定下来了，没有晕倒的危险，我瞧了瞧罗切斯特先生，示意他看着我。他满脸苍白，面无表情，好像岩石一般；他的眼睛直冒火花，却又坚如燧石。他一点也没有否认那人所说的话，似乎要挑战一切。没有任何言语、任何微笑，甚至都没有把我看做一个人，而只是用胳膊紧紧搂住我的腰，把我紧紧地拉到他身边。

“你是谁？”他反问那个入侵者。

“我叫布里格斯，是伦敦某某街的一名律师。”

“你难道真要把一个莫须有的妻子强加给我吗？”

“先生，我想我应该要提醒你你妻子的存在。即使你不承认，可是在法律上她还是你的妻子。”

“那你能给我描述一下她的情况吗？关于她的姓名、出身以及她居住在什么地方。”

“没问题。”说完布里格斯先生镇定自若地从口袋里取出了一份文书，用鼻音很重的官腔读道：





我断言并证明，公元某某年十月二十日（十五年前的一天），英国某某郡桑菲尔德庄园及某某郡芬丁庄园的爱德华·费尔法克斯·罗切斯特与我的姐姐，商人乔纳斯·梅森及妻子克里奥尔人安托瓦内特的女儿，贝莎·安托瓦内特·梅森，在牙买加的西班牙城某某教堂举行婚礼。婚礼的记录可见于教堂的登记簿——现在其中一份记录就在我手中。

理查德·梅森





“即使这份文件是真的，也只能证明我曾经结过婚，但是也无法证明上述被称为我妻子的女人还活着。”

“三个月之前她还活着。”律师反驳道。

“你怎么知道？”

“在这件事情上，我有一位证人，他的证词恐怕连罗切斯特先生自己也难以反驳。”

“叫他出来——不然你就见鬼去吧。”

“我这就把他叫出来——他就在现场。梅森先生，麻烦你到前面来。”

一听到“梅森”这个名字，罗切斯特先生立刻咬紧了牙关，同时还承受着一种强烈的抽搐性的颤抖。我就在他身边，来自他周身的愤怒和绝望的痉挛我都感受到了。这时候一直躲在幕后的第二个陌生人走了出来，只见律师的肩头上露出一张苍白的脸——不错，这就是梅森先生本人。罗切斯特先生回头怒视着他。我常说他眼睛是黑的，而现在因为愁上心头，便有了一种黄褐色的光，不，是带血色的光。他的脸涨红了——橄榄色的脸颊和没有血色的额头，也由于心火不断上升和扩大而闪闪发亮。他动了动，举起他强壮的胳膊——他完全可以痛打梅森一顿，把他击倒在教堂的地板上，无情地把他揍得断气——但梅森往后缩了一下，低声叫了起来：“天哪！”一种冷冷的蔑视在罗切斯特先生心中油然而生，就仿佛蛀虫使植物枯萎一样，他的怒气消失了，只是问了一句：“你有什么要说的？”

梅森先生苍白的唇间给出的回答几乎听不到。

“真是见鬼，你连话都说不清楚。我再次问你，你有什么要说的吗？”

“先生——先生——”牧师插话道，“别忘了你是在一个神圣的地方。”随后他转向梅森，轻声问道：“你知道这位先生的妻子还活着吗？”

“勇敢点，”律师催促，“说啊。”

“她现在住在桑菲尔德庄园，”梅森用比较清晰的声调说，“今年四月我还在桑菲尔德见过她。我是她亲弟弟。”

“在桑菲尔德庄园？”牧师失声叫道，“不可能！先生，我住在这个地方好多年了，我从来没听说过桑菲尔德庄园还有一位罗切斯特太太。”

我看见罗切斯特先生的嘴唇被一阵狞笑扭歪了，随后他自言自语道：

“不——上帝啊！我千方百计不让外人知道有这件事情——或者知道她是我的妻子。”他沉思着——思考了十多分钟，终于打定主意宣布道：

“够了——索性把一切都挑明了吧，就像把枪膛里的子弹一股脑地都打出来一样。沃德先生，合上你的书，脱下你的法衣吧。约翰·格林（执事），请你也离开教堂。今天没有婚礼了。”说完，执事离开了教堂。

罗切斯特先生大胆而又不顾一切地继续说了下去：“重婚是一个丑陋的字眼！——但是我就是故意要成为重婚者，但命运却挫败了我，或者说是上天制止了我——也许后者的几率会更大一些。此刻我比魔鬼强不了多少。正如我那位牧师告诉我的，我必定会受到上帝最严厉的审判——甚至该受不灭的火和不死的虫的折磨。先生们，我的计划被打破了！——这位律师和他的委托人所说的都是真的。我结过婚，并且跟我结婚的女人还活着！沃德，你说在你居住的地方从来没有听说过有一位罗切斯特太太，可是，也许你已经多次听到人家谈论过在那儿看管着的一个神秘的疯子吧。肯定有人偷偷地告诉你，说她是我同父异母的私生姐姐，也肯定有人说她是被我抛弃的情妇。现在我告诉你们，她是我的妻子——就是十五年前跟我结婚的女人——她的名字叫贝莎·梅森，是这位果敢人物的姐姐。此刻他正用颤抖的四肢、苍白的脸颊向你们表示男子汉们的心是多么刚强。拿出你的勇气来，迪克？——用不着怕我！——我不会打你，就像我不会打女人一样。贝莎·梅森是个疯子，并且出身于一个疯人家庭——三代都是白痴和疯子！她的母亲，那个克里奥尔人，是个疯子也是个酒鬼！——这些都是我和她的女儿结婚后才发现的，因为以前他们对家庭的秘密只字不提。贝莎像是一个百依百顺的孩子，在这两方面承袭了她母亲。我有过一位迷人的伴侣——她纯洁、睿智、谦逊。你们可以想象我是一个多么幸福的男人——我经历了多么丰富的场面！啊！我的阅历真有趣，要是你们知道就好了！不过我不再进一步解释了，布里格斯、沃德、梅森——我邀请你们到桑菲尔德庄园去，去看一下普尔太太的病人，也就是我的妻子！——到时候你们会看到我被骗娶了一个什么样的女人，然后你们再评判一下我是不是有权撕毁这段荒唐的婚约，寻求至少是符合人性的同情。

“这位姑娘，”他看着我继续说道，“沃德，对这个令人厌恶的秘密，她并不比你们知道得多。她认为一切既公平又合法，做梦都没想到自己会落入圈套，与一个已经跟恶劣的野兽般的疯子结合的受了骗的可怜虫缔结婚姻！来吧，你们都跟我来！”

他仍然紧紧握着我的手，离开了教堂。其余三位先生跟在后面。在大厅的前门，早已准备好的马车停放在那里。

“约翰，把它送回马车房，”罗切斯特先生面无表情地说，“今天不需要它了。”

我们进门时，费尔法克斯太太、阿德拉、苏菲、莉娅都走上前来祝贺我们。

“走开，统统都走开！”主人喊道，“拿着你们的祝贺一起走开！谁需要它？——我可不要！——你们的祝贺足足晚了十五年！”

他继续往前走，上了楼梯，一面仍紧紧握着我的手，一面还招呼先生们跟着他，他们照着做了。我们走上第一道楼梯，穿过走廊，走到了第三层楼。一扇又矮又黑的门出现在我们面前。罗切斯特先生用主人钥匙打开了这扇门，让我们进了铺有花毯的房间，房内有一张大床和一个饰有图案的柜子。

“你肯定知道这个地方，梅森先生，”我们的向导说，“因为她曾经在这里咬过你，用匕首刺伤过你。”

他撩起墙上的帷幔，出现第二扇门，罗切斯特先生又把它打开。在一间没有窗户的房间里，燃着一堆火，外面用一个又高又坚固的火炉围栏围着，点着一盏灯，在从天花板上垂下的铁链子上挂着。格雷斯·普尔俯身向着火，显然在锅里面炖着什么。在房间另一头的阴暗处，一个影子在前后跑动着，那究竟是野兽还是人，当我们第一眼看到的时候很难做出判断。它好像四肢着地趴着，又是抓又是叫，活像某种奇异的野生动物。但是它却罩着衣服，密密层层的黑发间夹杂着些许白发，蓬乱得像马鬃似的遮住了它的头和脸。

“早上好，普尔太太！”罗切斯特先生说，“你好吗？你照管的人今天怎么样？”

“还可以，先生，谢谢你。”格雷斯一面回答，一面小心地把烧滚了的乱七八糟的东西放在炉旁架子上，“有些急躁，但没有到暴怒的程度。”

一阵凶恶的叫声似乎要揭穿她报喜的言论，这条穿了衣服的野狗直起身来，高高地用后腿站起来。

“哎呀，先生，她看见你了！”格雷斯叫喊道，“你最好还是离开这里。”

“只待一会儿，格雷斯。你就让我待一会儿吧。”

“那你要当心点，先生！看在上帝的分上，当心！”

这疯子咆哮着，把她乱蓬蓬的头发从脸上撩开，凶狠地盯着来访者。我清清楚楚地记得那发紫的脸，还有那肿起来的五官。普尔太太走上前来。

“别拦着我。”罗切斯特先生说着把她推到了一边，“我想她现在手里没有刀吧，而且我会当心的。”

“谁也不知道她手里到底有什么，先生，她那么狡猾，我们不能用常人的思维来判断她的诡计。”

“我们还是走吧。”梅森悄声说。

“你见鬼去吧！”这是他姐夫给他的建议。

“当心！”格雷斯大声喊道。三位先生不约而同地往后退，罗切斯特先生把我拉到他背后。只见那个疯子猛扑过来，恶狠狠地掐住罗切斯特先生的脖子，使劲用牙咬他的脸颊，他们扭打在一起。她是大个子女人，腰圆膀粗，身材几乎与她丈夫不相上下。扭打过程中，那个疯子显露出男性般的力量，尽管罗切斯特先生有着健康的体魄，但不止一次地险些被那个女人掐死。他完全可以狠狠地给她一拳将她彻底制服，但是他并没有那样做，他宁愿搏斗。最后他终于掌控了她的胳膊。格雷斯·普尔递给他一根绳子，他将她的手反绑起来，又用身边的一根绳子将她绑在一把椅子上。这一连串动作是在凶神恶煞般的叫喊和猛烈的反扑中完成的。随后罗切斯特先生转向旁观者，带着辛辣而凄楚的笑看着他们。

“这就是我的妻子。”他说，“那就是我所知道的夫妻拥抱——那就是我消闲的慰藉与亲热！这位年轻的女孩子，在地狱门口是这么严肃、安静地看着一个魔鬼跳跃的游戏。我要她，是希望在那道呛人的菜之后换换口味。沃德先生和布里格斯先生，瞧瞧两者的区别吧！把这双清澈透明的眼睛与那边的红色球状体比较一下吧，把这张脸与那张面具，把这副身材与那个庞然大物比较一下吧，然后再来审判我。布道的牧师和护法的律师，都请记住，你们怎么审判我，将来也会受到怎样的审判。现在你们走吧，我要把我的宝贝藏起来了。”

我们都退了出来。罗切斯特先生过了一会儿也出来了，他对格雷斯·普尔进一步交代了一下。下楼的时候，那位律师叫住了我，对我说：

“小姐，”他说，“你没有任何责任，不应该受到任何指责。你叔叔听到这个消息将会很高兴，如果等梅森先生回到马德拉，他还活着的话。”

“我叔叔！他怎么样？你认识他吗？”

“梅森先生认识他，爱先生是他在丰沙尔的商号的多年老客户。你的叔叔接到你的信，得知你与罗切斯特先生有意结合时，梅森先生正好也在，他是在回牙买加的路上，逗留在马德拉群岛疗养的。爱先生提起了这个消息，因为他知道我的一个顾客与一位名叫罗切斯特的先生相熟。你可以想象，梅森先生听到这个消息时既惊讶又难过的表情，便披露了事情的真相。很遗憾，你的叔叔正卧病在床，考虑到疾病的性质——痨病，以及疾病的严重程度，他很可能会一病不起。因此他不可能亲自赶到英国，把你从掉入的陷阱中解救出来，但他恳求梅森先生立即采取措施来阻止这桩欺骗的婚姻。你叔叔让我帮梅森先生的忙。我一刻也没有耽搁，谢天谢地，总算并不太晚，无疑你也必定有同感。我相信在你赶到马德拉之前，你的叔叔极有可能已经去世了，要不我会建议你和梅森先生一起回去的。但事情既然如此，我想你最好还是留在英格兰，直到你得到爱先生的通知或听到关于爱先生的具体消息再行动吧。我们留在这儿还有什么事情吗？”他问梅森先生。

“没有了——我们快走吧。”听者急不可耐地回答。没有等向罗切斯特先生告别，他们便从大厅的正门出去了。牧师倒是留下来和他那几个高傲的教区居民说了几句话，或是劝导或是责备，尽了这番责任，也就离去了。

这时我已回到自己的房间里，站在半掩着的门旁边，听见他已经远去了。人都走光了，我把自己关进房间，闩上门，免得别人闯进来，然后开始——没有哭泣，没有悲伤，我对这件事情很镇静，只是——机械地脱下婚纱，换上昨天我穿的那件衣服，本来以为是最后一次穿它了。随后我坐了下来，感到浑身疲软。我用胳膊支着桌子，将头靠在手上。现在我开始思考了。在此之前，我只是听，只是看，只是动——由别人领着或拖着，跟上跟下——观看事情一件件发生，秘密一桩桩揭开。而现在，我开始思考了。

早上是很平静的——除了与疯子在一起的短暂场面，一切都平平静静。教堂里的一幕也并没有嘈杂喧哗，没有暴怒，没有大声吵闹，没有争辩，没有对抗或挑衅，没有眼泪，没有哭泣。几句话平静地对婚姻的合法性提出异议，罗切斯特先生问了几个严厉而简短的问题，对方做了回答和解释，援引了证据，罗切斯特先生公开承认了事实，随后看了活着的证据。破坏者走了，一切都过去了。

我像往常一样待在我的房间里——只有我自己，没有明显的变化。我没有受到折磨、损伤或者残害，然而昨天的简·爱又在哪儿呢？——她的生活在哪里？——她的希望又在哪里呢？

简·爱，她曾是一个热情、充满幻想的女人——差一点做了新娘——现在再次变成了冷漠、孤独的姑娘。她的生活苍白无力，她的希望暗淡无光。圣诞的霜冻降临在仲夏；十二月的白色风暴六月里便刮得天旋地转；冰凌替成熟的苹果上了釉彩；积雪摧毁了怒放的玫瑰；干草田和玉米地里覆盖着一层冰冻的寿衣；昨夜还姹紫嫣红的小巷，今日已经被无人踩踏的积雪封住了道路；十二小时之前还树叶婆娑、香气扑鼻犹如热带树丛的森林，现在已经白茫茫一片荒芜，犹如冬日挪威的松林，我的希望全都熄灭了——一夜之间降落在埃及的所有狮子身上的那种不可想象的命运袭击了我。回视我所珍惜的希望，昨天还是那么繁茂，那么光彩照人，现在却变得光秃秃、寒战战，成了铅灰色、永远无法复活的尸体。我审视着我的爱情，我主人所创造的那种感情，在我心里打着寒战，像冰冷摇篮里的一个生着病的孩子，病痛已经缠身，却又难以回到罗切斯特先生的怀抱——无法从他的胸膛得到温暖。啊，永远也回不到他那儿去了，因为信念已被扼杀——信任感已被摧毁！对我来说，罗切斯特先生不是过去的罗切斯特先生了，因为他已不像我所想象的那样。我不会把恶行加于他，我不会说他背叛了我，但是真理一尘不染的属性，已与他毫无关系，我必须离开，这点我非常清楚；什么时候走——怎样走——上哪儿去，我还不能说清。但我相信他自己会急于把我从桑菲尔德庄园撵走，他似乎已不可能对我怀有真情，而只有忽冷忽热的激情，而且受到压抑。他不再需要我了，现在我竟害怕与他狭路相逢，他一见我准感到厌恶。哎，我的眼睛多瞎！我的行动多软弱！

我的眼睛被蒙住了，而且闭了起来。旋转的黑暗飘浮着似乎包围了我，思绪滚滚而来犹如黑色的浊流。我自暴自弃、浑身松弛、百无聊赖。仿佛躺在一条大河干枯的河床上，我听见洪水从远山奔泻而来，我感觉到激流逼近了。爬起来吧，我没有意志；逃走吧，我又没有力气。我昏昏沉沉地躺着，渴望死去。有一个念头仍像生命那样在我内心搏动——上帝的怀念，并由此产生了无言的祈祷。这些话在我没有阳光的内心左右徘徊，仿佛某些话该悄声倾吐出来，却又无力去表达它们。

“求你不要远离我，因为困难临近了，没有人帮助我。”

困难确实临近了，而我并没有请求上天消灾灭祸——我既没有合上双手，没有屈膝下跪，也没有张嘴——困难降临了，洪流滚滚而来，把我吞噬。我意识到我的生活十分孤单，我的爱情消失了，我的希望破灭了，我的信心死掉了。这个想法犹如一个色彩单调的块状物，在我头顶有力地大幅度摆动着。这痛苦的时刻不堪描述，真是“水灌进了我的灵魂，我陷入了深深的泥淖，觉得无处立足，坠进深渊，激流把我淹没了”。





第二十七章


下午的某个时候，我抬起头来，环顾了一下四周，看见即将落下的太阳正在墙壁上映上落日的痕迹。我问自己：“我该怎么办？”

“立即离开桑菲尔德庄园”的想法闪入我脑海，这种想法是那么迅速，又那么可怕，我赶忙捂住了耳朵。我说：这些话我现在可受不了。“我没有成为爱德华·罗切斯特先生的新娘，这只是我痛苦中最小的部分，微乎其微，”我说，“从美梦中惊醒，发现一切都是水中月、镜中花，这种恐惧我也能忍受和克服。不过要我决然、迅速、永远地离罗切斯特而去，我承受不了，我也不能这么做。”

但是，内心的另一个声音却认为我应该这样做，而且预言我会这么做。我在不停地作着思想斗争，希望自己软弱些，这样就可以以躲避我脚下可怕而又痛苦的道路。但此时此刻，良知变得专横起来，抓住激情的喉咙，嘲弄她说：她那美丽的脚已经陷入了泥沼，还发誓要用铁臂把她推入深不可测的痛苦深渊。

“那么把我拉走吧！”我嚷道，“让别人来帮助我吧！”

“不，你得自己挣脱，没有人能帮助你。你必须自己挖出你的右眼，砍掉你自己的右手，让你的心成为贡品，而又必须由你自己戳穿。”

恐惧孤独中出没这么一位无情的判官，害怕寂静中充满这么可怕的声音。这样的孤独和寂静让我有些害怕，我蓦地站了起来。站直时只觉得脑袋发晕。我明白自己由于激动和缺乏营养而感到不舒服。那天我没有吃早饭，没吃肉，也没喝饮料。带着一种莫名的痛苦，我忽然想起来，我已经把自己关在里面好久了，但一直没有人来问我怎么样了，或者建议我下楼去，甚至连阿德拉也没有来敲我的门，费尔法克斯太太也没有来找我。“朋友们总是忘记那些被命运所抛弃的人。”我咕哝着，一面拉开门闩，一面走了出去。我被什么东西绊了一下；我头脑发晕，视线模糊，四肢无力，所以我无法立刻控制住自己。我跌倒了，但没有跌倒在地上，伸出的手扶住了我。我抬起头来——是罗切斯特先生，他正坐在我房门口的一把椅子上。

“你终于肯出来了。”他说，“我已经等了你很久，仔细倾听着房间里面的每一个声音；但既没有听到任何动静，也没有听到一声哭泣。如果再过五分钟你还不出来的话，我可就要像盗贼那样破门而入了。你想避开我？——你把自己关起来独自黯然神伤！我倒情愿你出来大骂我一顿。你是那么多愁善感，因此我估计你会大闹一场。我以为你会热泪如雨，只不过希望它们都落在我胸膛上；而现在，它们却洒落在了没有知觉的地板上，或是被湿透了的手帕吸收了。可是我错了，你根本没有哭！我看到了苍白的脸颊、暗淡的眼神，但没有看到泪痕。那么我想，你的心一定在流血，对吗？

“那么，简，你对我就没有一句责备的话吗？没有尖刻的、辛辣的话要说吗？没有挫伤感情或者打击激情的话语？你静静地坐在我让你坐的地方，用一种疲惫、被动的眼神看着我。

“简，我从来没想过要这样伤害你。如果一个男人像女儿般的养着一只小母羊，这只小母羊吃他的面包，喝他杯子里的水，躺在他的怀里，而他却在屠宰场把这只小母羊给误杀了，他对于这次血腥的大错的悔恨程度绝对不如我现在的心情，你能宽恕我吗？”

亲爱的读者，我当时当地就宽恕了他。他的目光隐含着那么深沉的忏悔，语调里透出这样真实的同情，举止中富有如此男子气的活力。此外，他的整个神态和风度中流露出那么矢志不移的爱情——我彻底宽恕了他，不过没有用语言表达出来，没有外露，而只是掩藏在心底。

“简，你认为我是个恶棍，对吗？”不久他若有所思地问——我想是对我继续缄默而感到纳闷，我那种心情是软弱而不是意志力的表现。

“是的，先生。”

“那就直截了当毫不留情地告诉我吧——不要顾及我的脸面。”

“我不想，我既疲倦又不舒服。我想喝点儿水。”他颤抖着叹了口气，把我抱在怀里，一直到楼下。起初我不知道他要把我带到哪个房间，在我呆滞的目光中一切都扑朔迷离。很快我感觉到了火的温暖，虽然时值夏天，我在自己的房间里早已浑身冰凉。他把酒递到我嘴边，我呷了以后，不久就苏醒过来了。随后我吃了些他拿来的东西，于是很快便恢复过来了。我意识到我在书房里——坐在他的椅子上——他就在我旁边。“要是我现在就毫无痛苦地结束生命，那倒是再好不过了，”我想，“那样我就不必狠心绷断自己的心弦，以中止和罗切斯特先生心灵上的联系。看来我得离开他。我不想离开他——我不能离开他。”

“你现在还好吗，简？”

“好多了，先生。很快就会好起来的。”

“再喝一口吧，简。”

我照他的话做了。随后他把酒杯放在桌上，站到我面前，目不转睛地看着我。突然他转过身来，发出一种充满激情但又含糊不清的声音；他快步走过房间，又折回来，朝我弯下身子，像是要吻我的样子；但我知道现在亲昵的抚爱已经被禁止。我转过头去，推开了他。

“为什么？——这是怎么回事？”他急忙嚷道，“哦，我知道了！你是不想吻贝莎·梅森的丈夫？你认为我的怀里已经有人，我的拥抱已经属于别人了，对吗？”

“无论怎么说，它都不属于我，也没有我的位置了，先生。”

“为什么，简？让我来替你回答吧——我想你会说因为我已经有了一个妻子——我猜得对吗？”

“是的。”

“要是你这样想，你肯定对我抱有成见了，你一定认为我是一个诡计多端的放荡子——低俗下贱的恶棍，煽起没有真情的爱，把你拉进预先设置好的圈套，剥夺你的名誉，毁掉你的自尊。你是不是这么认为的？我看你肯定不会提出异议：首先你身体依然很虚弱，花足够的时间才能喘过气来；其次，你还没有形成指控我、辱骂我的习惯；另外，眼泪的闸门打开着，如果你倾诉得太多，泪水会夺眶而出。你不想反抗我，斥责我以及对我大吵大闹，因为你正思考着如何做——你认为空谈一点作用也不起。我了解你——我正等待着。”

“先生，我不想与你作对。”我说，我那颤抖的嗓音警告我要把话缩短。

“不按你的话而从我的理解看来，你正策划着如何毁灭我。你刚才已经清清楚楚地告诉我：我是一个已婚男子，正因为这样，你才躲避我；刚才你已经拒绝了我的吻。你打算跟我完全成为陌路人，只是作为阿德拉的家庭教师住在这所房子里。如果我曾经对你说了句友好的话，要是曾经有一种友好的感情使你再次接受我，你会说：‘那个男人差点让我成了他的情妇，我必须对他像冰一样冷酷，像岩石一样态度坚硬。’于是你就真的变成了冰块和岩石。”

我清了清喉咙，稳住了声音回答他：“一切都变了，先生。我也必须随之改变——这是毋庸置疑的。另外，为了避免感情的跌宕起伏和无休止的回忆与联想，那就只有一个办法——我想阿德拉需要另请一个家庭教师，先生。”

“噢，阿德拉会去学校——这我已经作了安排。我也不想让你整天活在桑菲尔德庄园可怕的联想和回忆的折磨中。这是个被诅咒的地方，是亚干[1]的营帐，是个傲慢的墓穴，在光天化日之下透出僵尸般的恐惧；这是个狭小的石头地狱，里面藏着一个真正的魔鬼，比我们想象中的千百个魔鬼还要可怕。简，你不要再待在这个地方了，我也一样。我明知道桑菲尔德庄园鬼影幢幢，却把你带到这儿来，这是我的过错。在我还没有见到你的时候，我就告诫他们对这座庄园的鬼魅三缄其口；所有这些只是因为我怕你一旦知道与谁同住在一个屋檐下，阿德拉就再也找不到肯待在这里的女家庭教师了。而我的计划又不允许我把这疯女人移到别的地方。我拥有一个比这里更幽静、更隐蔽的老房子，叫做芬丁庄园。要不是考虑到那里地处森林深处，环境污浊，加上良心的谴责，我没有这样做，但是我完全可以让她安安稳稳地住在那儿。那里潮湿的墙壁可能会很快从我肩上把她这个包袱卸下来。不过恶棍种种，恶行各有不同，我的用意并不在于间接谋杀，即便是对付恨之入骨的人。

“然而，向你隐瞒有个疯女人做邻居，就像用斗篷盖起一个孩子，把他放在一棵箭毒树旁边。那魔鬼把四周都毒化了，以前也一直是这样。不过我将把桑菲尔德庄园封闭起来，用钉子封住前门，用板条钉住窗户。我给普尔太太一年二百英镑，让她照顾我的妻子——你称之为我妻子的那个可怕的臭婆娘，跟她一起生活。只要给钱，格雷斯愿意干很多事，而且她可以让她在格里姆斯疯人院做管家的儿子来帮忙，在我的妻子发病的时候帮助她。我的妻子发作的时候，就像受妖精的蛊惑半夜要把人们烧死在床上，用刀刺他们，从骨头上把肉咬下来，和诸如此类的事情。”

“先生，”我打断他说，“对那个不幸的女人，你实在是过于冷酷无情。你一谈起她，就充满了厌恶和反感。这很残忍——并不是她自己想疯的！”

“简，我的小宝贝——我会这么叫你，因为你确实如此——你不了解你所谈论的事，你错怪我了。我并不是因为她疯了才恨她。要是你疯了，你觉得我会恨你吗？”

“我想你会的，先生。”

“那你又错了。你一点也不了解我，一点也不了解我所拥有的爱。你身上每一块肌肤都如同我自己身上的一样宝贵，即使在生病或痛苦的时候也是如此；你的思想是我珍视的财富，即使它支离破碎，我也同样会珍惜；要是你呓语连篇，拥抱你的会是我的胳膊，而不是紧身马甲——即使你发怒的时候，对我来说也是一种诱惑。如果你像今天早上那个疯女人一样朝我扑来，我会张开双臂拥抱你，亲爱的程度至少和约束的程度相仿。我不会像对她一样带着厌恶的情绪退缩。你安静的时候，没有任何的监视者或看护人，只有我陪在你身边；我会不厌其烦地温柔地对你，即使你不会回报给我一个微笑；我还会目不转睛地注视着你的眼睛，尽管它们永远都不会发出认识我的光芒。但是我为什么要那样想呢？我刚谈着让你离开桑菲尔德庄园。你知道，一切都准备好了，让你立刻离开这里，明天你就走。我只能委屈你在这个庄园里再忍受一个晚上，简，之后你就可以向痛苦和恐惧永远说再见了。我安排好了一个地方，那会是个安全的避难所，在那里，可以躲开不堪回首的记忆、不受欢迎的干扰——甚至还有欺诈和诽谤。”

“带着阿德拉吧，先生，”我插嘴说，“她可以给你做伴。”

“你这是什么意思，简？我已经告诉过你了，我要送阿德拉去上学。我为什么要一个小孩子——一个法国舞女的杂种——给我做伴，况且还不是我自己的孩子？你干吗把我跟她缠在一起？你为什么非得让阿德拉给我做伴？”

“你适才谈起了隐居，先生，而隐退和独居是枯燥乏味的，对你来说太乏味了。”

“独居！独居！”他恼怒地重复了两遍。“我看我必须解释一下。我不知道你的脸上正露出什么令人费解的表情。你要和我一起分享孤独，你明白吗？”

我摇了摇头。在他那么激情飞跃的时候，即使冒险不做声来表示不赞同也需要勇气。他在房间里飞快地走动着，随后停了下来，仿佛在一个地方生了根似的。他严肃地打量了我半天。我把目光从他身上移开，停留在火炉上，竭力摆出并保持一副安静和镇定的样子。

“现在简的性格出现了障碍。”他终于说，他的神态比我期望的要镇定。“到现在为止，这团丝线还是转得够顺利的，但我一直都知道，结头和谜团迟早会出现的，现在就是。此刻是烦恼、焦躁和无尽的麻烦！上帝呀！我真想动用参孙的一份力量，快刀斩乱麻！”

他又开始走动，但很快停了下来，这回正好停在我面前。

“简！你愿意听我讲讲道理吗？（他弯下腰来，贴在我的耳朵上说）因为要是你不听，我就要使用暴力了。”他的声音嘶哑，他的神态像是要冲破不可忍受的束缚，不顾一切地大胆放肆了。我看得出来，再过一会儿，要是再增一分狂乱的冲动，我就对他束手无策了。此刻，唯有在一瞬之间将他控制住，不然，一个表示厌恶、逃避和胆怯的动作将置我自己——还有他——于死地。然而我并不害怕，丝毫没有。我感到一种内在的力量，一种气势在支持着我。危急关头往往险象环生，但也并非没有魅力，就像印第安人乘着皮筏穿过激流所感觉到的那样。我握住他捏得紧紧的手，松开他扭曲的手指，抚慰他说：

“坐下来，你想谈多久我就跟你谈多久，你想说什么，不管有理无理，我都听你说。”

他坐了下来，但我并没有让他马上开口，我强忍眼泪很长时间，竭力不让它流下来，因为我知道他不喜欢看到我哭。但现在我认为还是让它们肆意地流淌更好一些，爱流多久就流多久。要是满腹的泪水惹怒了他，那就更好了。于是我开始放纵自己，尽情地哭泣起来。

不久我就听他真诚地求我镇静下来，我说他那么怒火冲天，我可无法镇静下来。

“可是，简，我并没有生气。我只是太爱你了。你那苍白的小脸神色木然，冷若冰霜，我受不了。好了，别哭了，把眼泪擦一下吧。”

他软下来的口气说明他已经克制住了自己的情绪。因此我也随之安静下来。这时他试着把他的头靠在我肩上，但我拒绝了。随后他一把把我揽到他怀里，我拒绝了！

“简！简！”他说，声调那么伤心，我的每根神经都为之触动。“你不再爱我了？你看重的只是作为我妻子的身份和地位吗？现在你认为我已经没有资格做你的丈夫，你就害怕我碰你，好像我是什么癞蛤蟆或者猿猴似的？”

这些话刺痛了我，可是我又能做什么，说什么呢？也许我应当什么也不做，什么也不说。但是我被悔恨折磨着，因为我伤了他的感情，我无法抑制自己的愿望，忍不住在因我而起的伤口上敷上止痛药。

“我的确很爱你，”我说，“以前从未这么爱过。但我绝不能表露或放纵这种感情。这是我最后一次表达我的爱意。”

“最后一次，简！什么！你认为可以跟我住在一起，天天看到我，虽然仍然爱我，却又经常保持冷漠和疏远吗？”

“不，先生，我肯定做不到，因此我认为只有一个办法，但要是我说出来，你准会发火。”

“噢，说吧！我就是大发雷霆，你也有哭鼻子的本事。”

“罗切斯特先生，我必须得离开你。”

“离开多长时间，简？几分钟吧，去梳理一下你有些蓬乱的头发或洗一下你看上去有些发烧的脸庞吗？”

“我必须得离开阿德拉和桑菲尔德庄园。我必须和你永远分离，今生今世都不再见面。我必须在陌生的面孔和陌生的环境中开始新的生活。”

“当然。我和你说过你应当这样。我不理睬你一味要走的疯话。我的意思是你得成为我的一部分。至于新的生活，那很好，但你得成为我的妻子。我没有结过婚。你得成为罗切斯特太太——应当名实相符。只要你我还活着，我只会守着你。你得去我在法国南部拥有的一个地方，地中海沿岸一座墙壁雪白的别墅。在那里有人守护着你，你准会过着无忧无虑的幸福生活。绝不必担心我会引诱你上当——让你成为我的情妇。你为什么摇头？简，你得通情达理，要不然我真的会再发狂的。”

他的嗓子和手都颤抖着，他大大的鼻孔张大了，他的眼睛冒着火光，但我依然敢说：

“先生，你的妻子还活着，这是早上你自己承认的事实。要是按你的希望与你一起生活，我岂不成了你的情妇？别的说法都是诡辩——是欺骗。”

“简，我不是一个脾气温和的人——你忘了这点。我忍不了很久。我并不冷静，也不是一个不动感情的人，可怜可怜我和你自己吧，把你的手指按在我脉搏上，感觉一下它怎样跳动吧，而且当心——”

他露出手腕，伸向我。他的脸颊和嘴唇因为失血而变得苍白。我左右为难，十分苦恼。用他所厌恶的拒绝把他煽动起来吧，那是残酷的；要让步呢，又不可能。我做了一件走投无路的人出于本能会做的事——求助于高于凡人的神明。“上帝帮助我！”这句话从我嘴里脱口而出。

“我真傻。”罗切斯特先生突然说。“我老是告诉她我没有结过婚，却没有解释为什么。我忘了她一点也不知道那个女人的性格，不知道我与她地狱一般结合的背景。哦，我可以肯定，一旦简知道了我所知道的一切，她准会同意我的看法。把你的手放在我的手里，珍妮特——这样我有接触和目光为依据，证明你在我旁边——我会用寥寥几句话，告诉你事情的真相。你能听我吗？”

“是的，先生。听你几小时都行。”

“我只要求几分钟。简，不知你是否知道我在家里不是长子，我上面还有一个哥哥？”

“我记得费尔法克斯太太曾经告诉过我。”

“那你听说过我的父亲是个贪得无厌的人吗？”

“大致了解一些。”

“嗯，简，出于贪婪的本性，我父亲不能容忍财产因为要分给我相当一部分而被分割的事实，决心要保持他的财产的完整性，于是他把所有的财产都留给我哥哥罗兰。然而他也不忍心他的儿子成为穷光蛋，他决定为我物色一份富有的婚姻。不久之后他替我找了个伴侣。他有一个叫梅森的旧识，是西印度的一位种植园主和商人。在作了调查之后，他肯定梅森先生家业很大。梅森先生有一儿一女，并且他还打听到，梅森先生愿意给他女儿三万英镑的财产作为嫁妆，那已经足够了。我大学一毕业就被送往牙买加，跟一个已经跟我定了亲的新娘成婚。但我的父亲对巨额嫁妆的事情只字未提，只告诉我梅森小姐有倾城之貌，后来的事实证明此言不虚。她的确是个美人，身材高大，皮肤黝黑，雍容华贵，有布兰奇·英格拉姆的派头。她家里也希望把我弄到手，因为我和她一样有不错的身世。他们把她带到聚会上给我看，打扮得很华丽。我和她单独见面的机会很少，也很少跟她私下交谈。她奉承我，还故意卖弄姿色和才艺来讨好我。她圈子里的男人似乎都被她所倾倒，同时也羡慕我，我被弄得眼花缭乱，激动不已。我的感官被刺激起来了，由于幼稚无知，没有经验，以为自己爱上了她。社交场中的愚蠢角逐，年轻人的好色、鲁莽和盲目，会使人什么糊里糊涂的蠢事都干得出来。她的亲戚们怂恿我，情敌们激怒我，她来勾引我。于是我还几乎不知道是怎么回事儿，婚事就定了。呵——一想起这种行为我便失去了自尊！——我被内心一种自我鄙视的痛苦所压倒，我从来没有爱过她，敬重过她，甚至也不了解她。她天性中有没有一种美德我都没有把握。在她的内心或举止中，我既没有看到谦逊和仁慈，也没有看到坦诚和高雅。而我娶了她——我是多么粗俗，多么没有骨气！真是个有眼无珠的大傻瓜！要是我没有那么大的过失，也许我早就——不过还是让我记住我在跟谁说话。

“新娘的母亲我从来没有见过，我以为她死了。但蜜月一过，我便发现自己搞错了。她不过是疯了，被关在疯人院里。我妻子还有个弟弟，是个不会说话的白痴。你所见到的那弟弟——尽管我讨厌他的亲人，却并不恨他，因为在他软弱的灵魂中，还有许多爱心，表现在他对可怜的姐姐一直很关心，以及对我一度显出狗一般的依恋——有一天很可能也会落到这个地步。我父亲和我哥哥罗兰对这些情况都知道，但他们只想着三万英镑，并且狼狈为奸坑害我。

“这都是些丑恶的发现，但是，除了隐瞒实情的欺诈行为，我不应当把这些都归罪于我的妻子。尽管我发现她的个性与我格格不入，她的趣味使我感到厌恶，她的气质平庸、低下、狭隘，完全不可能向更高处引导，向更广处发展；我发现无法跟她舒舒畅畅地度过一个晚上，甚至一个小时。我们之间没有真诚的对话，因为一谈任何话题，马上会得到她既粗俗又陈腐，既怪僻又愚蠢的呼应——我发觉自己绝不会有一个清静安定的家，因为没有一个仆人能忍受她不断发作暴烈无理的脾性，能忍受她荒唐、矛盾和苛刻的命令所带来的烦恼——即使那样，我也克制住了。我避免责备，减少规劝，悄悄地吞下了自己的悔恨和厌恶。我抑制住了自己的反感。

“简，我不想用这些乏味的细节来打扰你了，我要说的话可以用几句激烈的话来表达。我跟楼上那个疯女人住了四年，在那之前她折磨得我够呛。她的性格成熟了，并可怕地急剧发展。她的劣迹不计其数，而且那么严重，只有使用暴力才能加以制止，但我又不忍心。她的智力那么弱——而她的冲动又那么强啊！那些冲动给我造成了多么可怕的灾祸！贝莎·梅森——一个声名狼藉的母亲的女儿——把我拖进了骇人的痛苦深渊。一个男人与一个既放纵又鄙俗的妻子结合，这必定是在劫难逃的。

“在这期间我哥哥死了，四年之后我父亲也去世了。从那以后我富有了——但同时又穷得要命。我所见过的最粗俗、最肮脏、最下贱的生命与我联系在一起，被法律和社会称作我的一部分。而我不能通过任何法律程序加以摆脱，因为这时医生们发觉我的妻子疯了，她的放肆已经使发疯的种子早熟——简，你不喜欢我的叙述，你看上去好像很反感——其余的话我们要不改日再说？”

“不，先生，你把它讲完。我同情你——真诚地同情你。”

“简，同情这个词从某些人口中说出来是带有讨厌和污辱性的，完全有理由把它奉还给说出来的人。不过那是内心自私无情的人的同情，这是听到灾祸以后所产生的以自我为中心的痛苦，混杂着对受害者的盲目鄙视。但这不是你的怜悯，简。此刻你满脸流露的不是这种感情。此刻你眼睛里洋溢的，你内心搏动的，使你的手颤抖的是另一种感情。我的宝贝，你的同情和怜悯是爱的痛苦之母，它的痛苦是神圣的热恋出世时的阵痛。我接受了，简！让那女儿自由地降生吧——我的怀抱已等待着接纳她了。”

嗓音里透出的温存使我难过得心碎，也使我怀着不祥的恐惧，变得石头般冰冷。

“好，先生，继续说下去，你发现她疯了以后怎么办呢？”

“简——我那时到了崩溃的边缘，能把我和万劫不复隔开的就只剩自尊了。在世人的眼里，毫无疑问我已是名声扫地，但我决定保持自己在自己眼中的清白——我终于拒绝接受她罪孽的熏陶，挣脱了与她精神缺陷的联系。但世人依然把我本人和我的名字与她相提并论，我也仍旧天天能看到她，听到她的声音。我呼吸着的空气与她呼出的空气交织在一起。呸！此外，我还记得我曾是她的丈夫——对我来说过去和现在都对这种联想有说不出的厌恶。而且我知道，只要她还活着，我就永远不能成为别人的丈夫，不能娶一个比她好千倍的妻子。尽管她比我长五岁——她的家人和她的父亲甚至在她年龄这样的细节上也骗了我——她很可能跟我活得一样长，尽管她头脑简单，但体魄强健。于是在二十六岁的时候，我便感觉到了人生的暮年。

“直到一天夜里我被她的叫喊惊醒了——自从医生宣布她疯了以后，她自然是被关起来了——那是西印度群岛火燎似的夜晚，这种天气常常是飓风到来的前奏。我难以入睡，便爬起来开了窗。空气像含硫的蒸气——到处都让人透不过气来。从窗户外飞进来的蚊子嗡嗡地叫着，阴沉地在房间里打转。在那儿我能听到大海之声，像地震一般沉闷地隆隆响着。黑云在大海上空集结，月亮沉落在宽阔的红色波浪上，像一枚滚烫的炮弹，向颤抖着正酝酿风暴的海洋，投去血色的目光。我确实深受这种气氛和景色的感染，我的耳朵里充满了那个疯子的尖叫和咒骂声。咒骂中夹杂着我的名字，语调里充满仇恨，语言又那么肮脏！没有一个以卖淫为业的妓女，会使用比她更污秽的字眼，尽管隔了两个房间，我每个字都听得清清楚楚——西印度群岛薄薄的隔板丝毫挡不住她狼一般的嗥叫。

“‘这种生活，’我终于受不了了，‘是地狱！这些空气，这些声音就是无底的深渊！我有权解脱自己，这种人世的痛苦连同拖累我灵魂的沉重肉体会离我而去。我并不害怕狂热者信奉的地狱之火。将来的任何状况都比现在好——救救我，让我回到上帝那儿去吧！’

“我一面说，一面蹲在一只箱子旁边，打开了一只放着一对上了子弹的手枪的箱子。我想开枪结束我的生命。但这一念头只是一闪而过，由于我还是清醒的，那种激起自杀念头并使我万念俱灰的危机，转瞬即逝。

“来自欧洲的风吹过海面，穿过宽敞的窗户。暴风雨来了，一时间大雨滂沱，雷电交加，空气变得清新了。随后我设想并下定了决心。我在湿漉漉的园子里水珠滴答的橘子树下，在湿透的石榴和菠萝树间漫步，周围燃起了灿烂的热带黎明——于是我思考着，简——噢，听着，在那一时刻真正的智慧抚慰了我，向我指明了正确的道路。

“从欧洲吹来的甜甜的风，在格外清新的树叶间耳语，大西洋自由自在地咆哮着。我那颗早已干枯和焦灼的心，对着那声音舒张开来，仿佛注满了鲜活的血液——我的身躯渴望新生——我的心灵期盼甘霖。我重新看见了希望——感到了生的呼唤。我从花园一端的繁花拱形下眺望大海——它比天空更加蔚蓝。旧世界已经到了海的那一边，清晰的前景展现在面前，于是：

“‘走吧，’希望说，‘再回到欧洲生活吧，在那里人们不会知道你的名字曾被玷污过，也没有人知道你背负着多么龌龊的重荷。你可以把这个疯子一同带往英国，关在桑菲尔德，并给予应有的照料和看守。然后你可以随心所欲地去旅行，重新建构你自己喜欢的交际圈。那个让你长期受苦、败坏你的名声、践踏你的荣誉、毁灭你的青春的女人，她不是你妻子，你也不是她丈夫。但要让她的病情得到应有的照应，这是上帝要求你做的。让她的身份，她跟你的关系永远被忘却，你绝不要把这些告诉任何活人。把她安置在一个安全舒适的地方，悄悄地把她的堕落掩藏起来，离开她。’

“我完全遵从这个建议去做。我父亲和哥哥并没有把我婚姻的真实底细透露给他们的旧识，因为在我写给他们的第一封信里，我就向他们报告了我的婚姻状况——已经开始感受到它极其令人厌恶的后果，而且从那一家人的性格和体质中，看到了我可怕的前景——我顺便又警告他们要严守秘密。不久，我父亲替我选中的妻子的丑行，已经到了这个地步，使他也羞于认她为儿媳了。他非但不想承认这种关系，反而像我一样急于把它掩盖起来。

“随后我把她带到了英格兰，跟这么个怪物一起旅行，真的很可怕。当我最终把她带到桑菲尔德，看到她被安全地安置在那间三楼的房间里时，我高兴极了。在房间的内密室，她已经住了十年，十年来已被她弄成了野兽的巢穴——妖怪的密室。找一个合适的人照料她确实让我煞费周章。必须要找一位忠诚、值得信赖的人才行，因为她的胡言乱语随时都会泄露我的秘密；并且她偶尔清醒的几天——有时候是几周——会不停地辱骂我，说我的坏话。最后我从格里姆斯精神病院雇来了格雷斯·普尔。她和外科医生卡特——梅森被刺伤和咬伤的那个夜晚，就是他给梅森包扎的伤口——是知道我内心秘密的两个人。也许费尔法克斯太太确实曾经怀疑过什么，但是她不可能确切地知道事情的真相。事实证明，格雷斯总的来说还是个不错的看守人；虽然由于她的一个似乎无法医治的而且是从事这种麻烦职业的人常有的过错，她不止一次放松和丧失警惕。这个疯子既狡猾又恶毒，绝不放过任何一次利用看护人暂时疏忽的机会。有一次是偷偷藏匿了一把刀子，并用这把刀子捅了她的亲弟弟；有两次她偷拿了小密室的钥匙，夜里从里面逃出来。第一次的时候，她意图想把我杀死在床上，第二次是她对你进行了一次可怕的访问。多亏上帝保佑你，她只是把怨气发泄在了结婚礼服上，有可能它勾起了她自己结婚时候的模糊回忆。至于接下来要发生什么，我都不敢继续往下想。当我想起早上扑向我喉咙的那个东西用它又黑又红的脸俯在我的鸽子的巢上时，我的血凝结了——”

“那么，先生，”趁他顿住时我问，“你把她安顿在这里后，你做了些什么呢？你上哪儿去了呢？”

“我干了什么，简？我让自己变成了一个飘忽不定的人。我上哪儿去了？我像三月的鬼魂一样到处游荡。我到大陆去，辗转去了它所有的国家。我的目标是找寻一个聪明出色的女人，一个值得我爱的女人，一个和我留在桑菲尔德的那个泼妇相反的女人——”

“但你不能结婚，先生。”

“我决心要结婚，而且我深信我有资格结婚，我应当结婚。虽然我欺骗了你，但我的本意并非想欺骗谁。我有意要和盘托出我的故事，光明正大地求婚。因为在我看来，我有自由爱别人，也有资格被爱，是完全合乎情理的。我坚信我一定能找到愿意而且能够理解我的故事的女人，尽管我背负着诅咒的包袱。”

“是吗，先生？”

“看到你刨根究底的样子，简，我禁不住想笑。你像一只小鸟睁开急切的眼睛，时而局促不安地动来动去，仿佛口头回答的语速太慢，你还想读一读人家心上的铭文。在我继续往下讲之前，告诉我‘是吗，先生？’是什么意思。你经常使用这个小小的问句，它常常引导我进入滔滔不绝的讲述中，我不清楚究竟是为什么。”

“我的意思是——随后发生了什么？你怎么继续下去？这件事情后来怎样了？”

“确实是这样。那现在你想知道什么呢？”

“你是否找到了自己喜欢的人，如果找到了，是否要求她嫁给你，她又是怎么说的呢？”

“我可以告诉你不管我是否找到了自己喜欢的人，是否向她求婚，但是她说了些什么却要记录在‘命运’的书本里。十年来我四处漂泊，先住在一个国家的首都，后来又到了另外一个。有时在圣·彼得堡，更多的时候是在巴黎，偶尔也会在罗马、那不勒斯和佛罗伦萨。有大量的金钱和祖宗的名号做保障，我可以选择我喜欢的社交圈，没有一个社交圈子会拒绝我。在众多的英国女士、法国伯爵夫人、意大利夫人[2]、德国伯爵夫人[3]中我寻找着我理想的女人，可是到头来我还是两手空空。有时候某个瞬间，我被某个眼神、某个声调、某个形体所吸引，我就以为我的梦想要实现了，但是我立刻从幻觉中醒悟过来。你不要以为我是个在心灵或人品上渴求完美的人，我只是想要适合我的女人——想要和那个克里奥尔人完全相反的女人，可是我的渴望只是徒劳。即使我是自由的——因为我已经受过不相称婚姻的危险、恐怖和厌恶的警告了——我也找不到一个让我向她求婚的女人。失望让我变得焦躁不安。我尝试着过放荡的生活——但不是淫荡的生活。淫荡，我过去痛恨，现在也一样。但淫荡确实是我那印第安妻子的本性。对于淫荡和对于她的深恶痛绝，甚至在我寻欢作乐时都给了我很大的约束。凡是近似淫乱的任何享乐似乎都使我变得接近她和她的罪过，因此我都一概不沾。

“但是我无法独自生活，所以我尝试找情妇来做伴。我第一个情妇是塞莉纳·瓦伦——这一步又是一个让人回忆起来自己都轻视自己的事情。你现在已经知道她是什么样的人，我们之间的不正当关系是如何结束的。她之后还有两个，一个是意大利人嘉辛塔，另一个是德国人克莱拉，两个都被人认为美妙绝伦。几周之后，她们的美貌在我眼里又算什么呢？嘉辛塔不讲道德而且蛮横无理，三个月之后，我就对她厌倦了；克莱拉诚实文静，但很笨，没有头脑，很不敏感，一点也不对我的口味。我很乐意地给她投资一笔钱去创建她自己的生意，这样，我就很体面地把她也打发掉了。但是，简，从你的脸上我可以看出来，你现在正在对我形成一个很坏的看法。你认为我是个没有感情、没有道德的流氓，是吗？”

“说实在的我并不像以前有时候那么喜欢你，先生。你难道一点也不觉得这种一会儿这个情妇、一会儿那个情妇的生活方式不对吗？你谈起来仿佛这是理所当然的。”

“我是曾有这个想法，但我不喜欢那样的生活。这是一种苟且偷生的生活，我绝不想走回头路了。找一个情妇是仅次于买一个奴隶的糟糕事情；情妇和奴隶的天资往往比较低下，地位也很低；跟比自己低的人一起亲密地生活会使人堕落。我现在讨厌和塞莉纳、嘉辛塔还有克莱拉在一起的日子。”

我觉得这番话很真实，并从中做出了推断：要是我忘掉自己，忘掉曾经灌输给我的教导，用任何借口、任何辩解，受了任何诱惑，步那几个可怜姑娘的后尘，那他总有一天会用现在亵渎对她们的回忆的那种感情来看待我。我并没有把这个想法说出来，只要能感受到就够了。我把它印在心坎里，让它在我受到考验的时刻对我有所帮助。

“噢，简，现在为什么不说‘是的，先生？’了呢？我还没有说完呢。你看起来神情严肃，我知道你不同意我的看法。我们还是言归正传吧。去年一月，我打发走了所有的情妇，带着粗暴、痛苦的心情——那是到处漫游、空虚而孤独的生活的结果——受到失望的侵蚀，对所有人都怒气冲天，特别是对所有的女人都怀有敌意——因为，我开始认为理智、忠实、可爱的女人不过是一种梦想——因为事务需要，我回到了英格兰。

“在一个寒冷的冬日下午，我骑着马在路上走着，已经看见桑菲尔德庄园了。让人毛骨悚然的地方！我不期望那儿有什么平静和快乐。我看到一个文静的人影独自坐在干草道的阶梯上。我不经意地从她身旁走过，就像路过对面修剪过树梢的柳树一样。她对我意味着什么，我没有任何的预感；这小家伙与我会有什么关系，我没有预感，也没有内心的感应暗示我。我生活的主宰——不管好坏，我生活的守护神——穿着一身简陋的衣服坐在那儿等着我。我并不知道她，当我的梅斯罗出了事故，这个小家伙一本正经上来要求帮忙时，我也还不知道。这样一个孩子般的小家伙，仿佛一只红雀跳到我脚边，提议用它细小的翅膀背负我。我有些粗暴，但这小家伙就是不走，站在我旁边，固执得出奇，一副不容违抗的神态和口气。我得有人帮忙，而且由那双手来帮，结果我得到了帮助。

“我一压那娇柔的肩膀，某种新的东西——新鲜的活力和感觉——悄然地流进了我的躯体。好在我已知道这个小精灵得回到我身边——她住在下面属于我的房子里面，否则她从我的手底下溜走，消失在暗淡的树篱中，我会感到非常遗憾的。那天晚上我听到你回家，简，尽管你很可能没有意识到我在思念你或注视着你。第二天当你跟阿德拉在走廊玩耍的时候，我在一个不被人看见的地方足足观察了你半个小时。我记得那是一个雪天，你们不能到户外。我在我的房间里面，门半掩着；我可以聆听，也可以观察。阿德拉一时占据了你的注意力，但我幻想你的思想在别的地方。但是我的小简，你对她非常有耐心，你和她说话，陪她玩了好长一段时间。当最后她离开你的时候，你又立刻陷入了沉思。你开始在走廊上慢慢地踱起步来，不时经过窗前，你往外眺望着纷纷扬扬的雪，倾听着似泣似诉的风，你再次轻轻地走着，陷入了遐想。我想那些天白天的光线并不很暗，你的眼睛里时而映现出一种愉悦的光，面容里露出柔和的兴奋，表明这不是一种痛苦、暴躁、疑病症式的沉思。你的目光中透出一种青春的甜蜜思索，心甘情愿的翅膀载着青春的心灵，追逐着希望的踪影，不断登高，飞向理想的天国。费尔法克斯太太在大厅里与仆人说话的声音惊醒了你，而你奇怪地独自笑着，对自己笑，珍妮特。你的微笑蕴含着多种含意，既十分敏锐，也似乎是笑你自己的心不在焉。它仿佛说：‘我所看到的美好景象尽管不错，但我绝不能忘记这是绝对虚假的。在我的脑海里，有一个玫瑰似的天空，一个红花绿草的伊甸园；但在外面，我完全意识到，脚下有一条坎坷的路要走，有渐渐聚拢的黑色风暴要面对。’你跑下楼，问费尔法克斯太太有什么事情需要帮忙，我想是清算一周的家务账目等诸如此类的事情吧。你离开了我的视线，我对你很生气。

“我焦急地等待着夜晚的到来，那时我就可以把你叫到我的面前。我猜想你有一种不同寻常的性格，对我来说这是一种全新的性格。我渴望更深一层地探寻它，更进一步地了解它。你进了房间，目光与神态既腼腆又很有主见。你穿着古怪——很像你现在的样子。我让你讲话，不久我就发现你身上充满奇怪的反差。你的装扮和行为举止受戒律的约束，你的神情是胆怯的，完全是那种天性高雅绝不适应社交的人，很害怕自己的失礼和错误而出丑。但一旦与你交谈，对方就会感受到你投去的锐利、大胆、闪亮的目光。你的每个眼神都有一种穿透力。问你思路严密的问题，你应对如流。你似乎很快对我习惯了——我相信你觉得在你与你的严厉、暴躁的主人之间，有引起共鸣的地方，因为我惊异地看到，一种愉快的自在感，立刻使你的举止变得平静了。尽管我暴跳如雷，你并没有对我的乖戾露出惊奇、胆怯、苦恼或不快。你观察着我，不时朝我笑笑，那笑容中带着一种难以形容的朴实和聪明伶俐的神态。我立刻对我所目睹的感到满意和兴奋。我喜欢已经见到的东西，而且希望见得更多。然而很长一段时间我疏远你，很少找你聊天、谈话。我是一个精神享乐主义者，希望与这位活泼的新朋友相识而带来的喜悦能经久不衰。此外，我一时为一种拂之不去的忧虑所困扰，担心要是我随意摆弄这朵花，它就会凋谢，新鲜诱人的魅力也会随之消失。那时我并不知道，这不是一朵朝开夕落的花朵，而是一种灿烂绚丽不可摧毁的宝石花。此外，我想看一看，要是我躲着你，你是否会来找我；但你没有，你待在书房里，像你的桌子和画板那样纹丝不动。要是我偶尔碰到你，你会很快走开，只是礼貌性地打一个招呼。简，在那些日子里，你惯有的表情是一种若有所思的神态：不是低沉沮丧，因为你没有病态；也不是轻松活泼，因为你没有什么希望和真正的快乐。我不知道你是怎么看待我的或者你是否想到过我。为了证实这一点，我继续观察你。你交谈时眼神中透出某种快意，举止中隐含着亲切。我看到你内心是喜欢与人交往的，但你的情绪却被清静的教室、乏味的生活折磨得很低落。我让自己享受对你亲切所带来的愉快，而善意很快激起了反应。你的面部表情变得温柔了，你的声调也变得亲切了。我很喜欢你叫我的名字，因为你的声音中带着感激和快乐的音符。那时候我真是喜欢邂逅你。简，你的一笑一颦中有一种很有意思的迟疑，你投给我的目光中有一种微微的困惑，那时游移不定，你不知道我可能会怎样地反复无常。我究竟是要摆出主人的架子，一脸的威严呢，还是做个朋友，平易近人呢？这时我已经太喜欢你了，不忍激起第一种念头。我真诚地伸出手时，清新、光明、幸福的表情便浮现在你年轻而充满渴望的脸上，我总是犹疑不定，免得自己当场就把你拉进怀抱。”

“不要说以前的那些日子了，先生。”我打断了他，偷偷地抹去了几滴眼泪。他的话对我来说是一种折磨，因为我知道自己该做什么——并且马上做——所有这些回忆和他情感的告白只会让我接下来的决定更加困难。

“不，简，”他回答说，“当现在的一切都更加确定，未来的日子会更加美好的时候，我们在这里缅怀过去又有什么不妥呢？”

听了这番糊涂的话，我不禁打了个寒噤。

“你现在明白是怎么回事了，对不对？”他继续说，“我的青年期和成年期的一半是在难以形容的苦难和无聊的寂寞孤独中度过的。我找到了你，平生第一次找到了我的真爱。你是我的同情者——最好的我自己——我最爱的天使，一种强烈的依恋把我和你连在了一起。我认为你很出色，聪明而可爱，一种热烈而庄严的激情隐藏在我内心。这种激情因你而起——把你拉到我生命的中心和源泉，让我的生命围绕着你——点燃起纯洁、强大的火焰，把你我共熔。

“正因为我感受到这点，清楚地知道这一点，所以我决定要和你结婚。提醒我我已经有一位妻子对我来说是无理的嘲弄。现在你知道我没有妻子，只有一个可怕的魔鬼。我试图欺骗你是我不对，但是我害怕你性格中固执的一面。我担心早就种下的偏见，我想在稳操胜券以后，再冒吐露真情的危险。这其实是怯懦，我应当像现在这样，先求助于你的高尚心灵和宽宏大度，直截了当地向你倾吐生活中的苦恼，向你描述我对更高级和更有价值的生活的渴求。不是向你表示决心——这字眼太弱了——而是不可抵御的爱意，即在被别人忠贞不贰地深爱着的时候，我也那么去爱别人，随后我应当要求你接受我忠贞的誓言，也要求你的誓言。简，把你的誓言告诉我吧。”

一阵静默。

“为什么不说话，简？”

我正经历着一次煎熬。一双铁铸火燎的手，紧紧抓住了我的要害。一个可怕的时刻，充满着搏击、黑暗和燃烧！人世间没有人比我更希望被爱，而爱我的人我也绝对地崇拜他，但我必须摒弃爱情和偶像。一个凄凉的字眼就表达了我不可忍受的责任——“走！”

“简，你明白我期待你干什么，就只是一个这样的承诺：‘我也将属于你，罗切斯特先生。’”

“罗切斯特先生，我不能属于你。”

又一次长时间的沉默。

“简！”他又开口了，嗓音里透出的温存使我难过得心碎，也使我怀着不祥的恐怖，变得石头般冰冷，因为这种平静的声音是狮子站起来时的喘息——“简，你的意思是，你要在世界的一个地方，而我在其他的地方，对吗？”

“是的。”

“简，”他俯下身子拥抱我，“你这会儿还是这个意思吗？”

“是的，”

“那么现在呢？”他轻轻地吻了吻我的额头和脸颊。

“是的。”我迅速地完全挣脱了他的拥抱。

“哦，简，这太残忍了！这——这是罪过，但爱我并不算罪过。”

“照你的话办会不道德。”

一种狂野的神色掠过他的脸庞使他双眉直竖。他站了起来，但还是克制着。我抓住椅背撑住自己；我颤抖，我害怕——但我依然决定那样做。

“等一下，简。看一看你走后我的可怕生活吧。你一走，一切幸福都随你而去。那时只剩下什么了？我只有楼上的一个疯子妻子，你还不如把我和墓地里的死尸扯在一起。我该怎么办，简？我去哪儿寻求一个志同道合的伙伴，又去哪儿寻求希望呢？”

“像我一样做，相信上帝，相信自己，相信上天，希望在那儿再次见到你。”

“那么你不会妥协了？”

“不会！”

“那你判我活着受罪，死了挨骂吗？”他提高了嗓门。

“我劝你活得清白，希望你死得安宁。”

“那你就把爱情和清白从我这里夺走了？你把我推回老路，拿肉欲当爱情，以作恶为职业？”

“罗切斯特先生，我不会把这种命运强加给你，就像我不会去抓住它作为自己的命运一样。我们生来就是要奋斗和忍受，你我都一样。那就这样做吧。在我忘记你之前，你会把我忘掉的。”

“你说这样的话是要把我当成一个骗子，你侮辱了我。我发誓我不会变，而你却当着我的面说我马上就会变心。你的行为证明，你的判断是多么歪曲，你的思想是多么乖戾！难道仅仅违背人类的一个法律不是比把你的同类推向绝望更好吗？——任何人都不会因为违背法律而受到伤害，因为你既无亲戚又无熟人，不必害怕由于与我生活而得罪他们。”

这倒是真的。当他说话的时候，我的良心和理智都背叛了我，责怪我拒绝他的罪过。两者似乎像感情一样大叫大嚷。“哦，同意吧！”它们说，“想想他的痛苦，想想他危险的处境——想想丢下他一个人的情形，记住他轻率冒险的本性，想一想伴随绝望而来的鲁莽吧——安慰他吧，拯救他吧！爱他，告诉他你的爱，告诉他你是属于他的。这个世界上谁会在乎你？或你的所作所为又能让谁受伤呢？”

但是那回答依然是不可改变的——“我在乎我自己，越是孤单，越是没有朋友，越是没有帮助，我就越尊重我自己。我将遵守上帝创造、世人遵守的规则；我会坚持我清醒时，而不是像现在发疯时接受的原则。法规和准则不光适用于没有诱惑的时刻，还用在像现在这样，肉体和灵魂起来抗拒它的严厉和苛刻的时候。它们再严厉也是不可破坏的。要是出于我个人的方便而违背它们，那它们还有什么价值？它们是有价值的——我向来相信如此。如果我此刻不信，那是因为我疯了——疯得可厉害啦，我的血管里燃烧着火，我的心跳快得难以计数。此刻我所能依靠的是原有的想法和以往的决心：我要岿然不动地站在那里。”

我这么做了，罗切斯特先生观察着我的脸色，看出我已经这么办了。他的愤怒到了极点。不管接下来会发生什么事情，他必须暂时让它发作一下。他从房间一头走过来，抓住我的胳膊，把我的腰紧紧抱住。冒火的眼睛，仿佛要把我吞下去似的。肉体上，这时我无能为力，就像扔在炉中的草根；精神上，我还控制着我的灵魂，并且肯定它最终会是安全的。幸亏眼睛能表达灵魂的意思，虽然常常是不自觉地表达，但是表达得很忠实。我抬眼看他的眼睛，当我望见他那一张凶狠的脸时，不由自主地叹了口气。他抓得我很疼，我用力过度，力气差不多耗尽了。

“从来没有，”他咬牙切齿地说，“从来没有任何东西那么脆弱，又那么坚强。在我手里她摸上去只不过像根芦苇（他紧握着手使劲摇我），我可以不费力地把它弄弯，但即使我把它弄弯了，拔起来，碾碎它，又有什么好处呢？想想那双眼睛，想想从中流露出的坚定、狂野、自在的目光，蔑视我，内中隐含的不只是勇气，还有坚韧的胜利感。不管我怎么折磨这个笼子，我都无法靠近它；这野蛮、漂亮的家伙，要是我撕坏或者打破这小小的监狱，我的暴行只会让囚徒获得自由。我也许可以成为这所房子的征服者，但我还来不及称自己为泥屋的拥有者，里边的居住者早就飞到天上去了。而我要的正是你的精神——富有意志、活力、德行和纯洁，而不单是你脆弱的躯体。如果你愿意，你自己可以轻轻地飞来，偎依着我的心坎，而要是违背你的意思死死抓住你，你会像一阵香气那样在我手掌中溜走——我还没有闻到你就消失了。哦，来吧，简，来吧！”

他一面说，一面松开了紧握的手，只是看着我。这眼神远比发疯似的紧抱更难以抗拒。然而现在只有傻瓜才会屈服。我已面对他的怒火，把它挫败了。我得避开他的忧愁，便向门边走去。

“你要走了，简？”

“是的，先生。”

“你要离开我了？”

“是的。”

“你不会回来了？你不愿来抚慰我、拯救我？——我对你深深的爱、我的狂暴的悲伤、疯狂的祈求，你都熟视无睹？”

他的嗓音里带着一种多么难以言表的悲哀！要毅然决然重复“我走了”这句话有多难！

“简！”

“罗切斯特先生。”

“离开吧——我同意——但记住，你丢下我，让我活在痛苦当中。回你自己的房间去，仔细想想我说的话。简，看看我的痛苦吧——想想我吧。”

他走开了，一脸扎进了沙发。“简！我的希望，我的爱，我的生命！”他痛苦地脱口而出，随后响起了深沉而强烈的哭泣声。

我已经走到了门边，可是读者呀，我走了回去——像我退出时一样坚决地走了回来。我跪倒在他旁边，把他的脸从靠垫转向我，吻了一下他的脸颊，用手梳理着他的头发。

“上帝祝福你，我亲爱的主人。”我说，“上帝会保护你免受伤害，不会让你做错事情的——他会指引你，安慰你，会好好地报答你过去对我的好意。”

“你对我的爱将是对我最好的报答。”他回答说，“没有它，我的心都碎了。但简会给我她的爱，是的，高尚而又慷慨。”

血一下子涌到了他的脸上，他的眼睛射出了火光。他猛地一跳，站直了身子，伸出双臂。但我躲开了拥抱，立刻走出了房间。

“别了。”我离开他时我的心在叫喊。绝望又使我加了一句话：“永别了。”





那天晚上我根本就没有想到要睡觉，但我一躺到床上就睡着了。我又梦到了小时候的情景。我梦见自己躺在盖茨黑德的红房子里，夜很黑，我的脑子里充满着奇怪的恐惧。使我昏厥的光，又出现在这情景中，似乎溜上了墙，抖动着停在模糊的天花板中间。我抬头去看，只见屋顶已化成了云彩，又高又暗。那光线像月亮冲破雾气时照在浓雾上的光。我看着月亮过来——带着奇怪的期待注视着，仿佛某种判决词将要刻写在圆圆的脸上。她从云层中冲了出来，从来没有什么月亮像她那么穿云破雾的。一只手伸进了她黑色的云层把它挥走，随后一个白色的人影出现在天空中，那人光芒四射的额头俯向大地，盯着我看了又看，并对我的灵魂说起话来。那种声音既远在天边，又近在咫尺。它就在我耳边低声说道：

“我的女儿，逃离诱惑吧！”

“母亲，我会的。”

从恍恍惚惚的睡梦中醒来后，我做出了回答。时候依然是夜间，但七月的夜很短，午夜过后不久，黎明便到来了。“对于我该着手做的工作怎样都不会嫌早的。”我想。我从床上爬起来，身上穿着衣服，因为除了鞋子我什么也没脱。我知道该在抽屉的哪个角落找到内衣、一个挂件和一枚戒指。在找寻这些东西时，我看到了罗切斯特先生几天前硬要我收下的一串珍珠项链。我把它留了下来，这不是我的，它属于那位已幻化的梦境中的新娘。我把其余的东西打进一个包裹里。钱包里还有二十先令（我的全部家产），我把它放进了口袋。我系好草帽，别上披肩，拿了包裹和那双没有穿上的拖鞋，悄悄地出了房间。

“再见了，善良的费尔法克斯太太！”我溜过她门口时悄声说。“再见了，我可爱的阿德拉。”我向育儿室看了一眼说。此时我已经不允许有进去拥抱她一下的念头了。我得骗过那双很尖的耳朵，也许它们此刻正在侧耳细听呢。

我本不打算在罗切斯特先生的房间跟前停下，但到了门口，我停止了心跳，脚也跟着停了下来。我听见房里的人在屋内踱来踱去，不停地叹息。要是我愿意，房间里有一个我的天堂，不过只是暂时的，我只要跨进门去说：

“罗切斯特先生，我会生生世世爱你，与你相伴。”喜悦的泉水会涌向我嘴边，我想到了这情景。

那位善良的主人，此刻难以成眠，不耐烦地等待着天亮。他在早上会把我叫去，发现已经走了；那他会派人找我，而发现一切都是徒劳。他会觉得自己被我无情地抛弃了，他的爱遭到了拒绝。他会痛苦，甚至会绝望。想到这里，我的手又向门锁伸了伸，但又缩了回来，仍然悄悄地往前走。

我凄凉地走下弯弯曲曲的楼梯，清清楚楚地知道自己需要干什么，便机械地去准备了。我在厨房里找到了偏门的钥匙，还找了一小瓶油和一根羽毛，把钥匙和锁都抹上油。我还准备了一些水和面包，来应付长途跋涉。我这几天身体状况不太好，可千万不能在中途倒下。悄悄地做完这一切之后，我轻轻地打开偏门，又轻轻地把它关上了。在院子里，看到太阳若隐若现，大门紧关着，偏门只是闩住了。我从这扇门走了出去，随手又把它关上，我出了桑菲尔德。

一英里外有一条路，通向与米尔科特相反的方向。这条路我从来没有走过，但曾经注意到它，不知道它通向哪里。我不假思索地沿着它走去。此刻，我不能回头看，也不能往前看，既不能回头，更没有未来可以展望。过去的时光好比一本书，那么美妙绝伦，又是那么哀伤至极；读上一行就会打消我的勇气，摧毁我的精力。而未来是一个可怕的空白，仿佛是洪水肆虐过的世界。

我沿着田野、篱笆和小路走着，直到太阳出来。我想这是一个宜人的夏日清晨，我知道离家时穿的鞋子已很快被露水打湿，但我没看初升的太阳、微笑的天空，也没看苏醒的大自然。被带往断头台的人，见到怡人的景色，不会有心思去想路上微笑的花朵，而只是想到行刑时的砧板和斧头的利刃，想到身首的分离，想到最终张着大口的墓穴。而我，想到了令人心灰意冷的逃跑、无家可归的流浪，还有我狠心逃离的那一切。但我也没有办法控制。此刻我想起了他——在他的房间里——看着日出，盼望我马上去说：我愿意与他待着，愿意属于他。我渴望属于他，渴望回去，现在还不算太晚。我能抚平他失去我的剧痛。而且可以肯定，我的逃跑还没有被发现。我可以回去，成为他的安慰者——他的骄傲、他的拯救者，免除他的悲苦，也许还有毁灭。哦，我担心他会自暴自弃——比我自暴自弃还要糟糕——多么强烈地刺激着我！这是插入我胸膛带倒钩的箭头，我想把它拔出来，它却撕裂我，而记忆进一步将它往里推去，我疼痛难忍。小鸟在矮树丛和灌木林中开始歌唱。鸟儿忠于它们的伙伴，是爱的标志。而我又是什么呢？在内心的疼痛和狂热地恪守原则之中，我讨厌我自己。我没有从自责中找到安慰，甚至在自尊中也找不到它。我已经损害——伤害——离开了我的主人。在我自己眼中我也是可憎的。但我不能回去，甚至后退一步。上帝得继续领我向前。至于我自己的意志或良心，充满激情的忧伤已经把一个扼杀，使另一个窒息。我一面在路上孤独地走着，一面号啕大哭，越走越快，就像发了狂。一种虚弱从内心开始扩向四肢，攫住了我，我摔了一跤。我在地上躺了一会儿，把脸埋在潮湿的草地上，我有些担心——或者说是希望——我会死在这儿。但我马上就起来了，先是两脚两手往前爬了一阵，随后再次站了起来——像以往那么急切和坚决地走到了大路上。

到了大路上，我不得不坐到树篱旁休息一下。正坐着，我听见了滚滚的车轮声，一辆马车向我驶来。我招了招手，它停了下来。我问车子要去哪里，马夫说了一个离这儿很远的地名，我确信罗切斯特先生在那儿没有亲戚。我问到那里需要多少钱，马夫说三十先令。我说我只有二十先令，他就勉强同意了。因为车是空的，他又允许我坐在里边。我走进去，关上门，车子继续前行。

好心的读者，我当时的心情希望你一辈子都不要感受，我那天流的眼泪希望你从来都没有流过，也希望你从来没有像我那样绝望而痛苦地祈祷。衷心地希望你永远不必像我这样担心会给你全身心爱着的人带来灾祸。

第二十八章


两天过去了。那是一个夏天的傍晚，马车夫把我放在了一个叫做惠特克劳斯的地方。我给他的车费已经花完，他不愿意再多载我一程，而我连一先令都没有了。这时，马车已经驶出一英里远，我独自站在那里。在那个时候，我发现我忘记取放在马车口袋里的包裹，我当初是为了安全起见才把它放在那里的。它一定还在那里，可是现在，我真是赤贫了。

惠特克劳斯不是一个城镇，甚至连乡村都不是。它不过是一根石柱，矗立在四条路的交汇点，粉刷得很白，想必是为了在远处和黑夜显得更醒目。柱顶上伸出四个指路标，按上面的标志看，离这个交汇点最近的镇有十英里，最远的二十多英里。从这些熟悉的地名上，我知道了自己身在何处；这儿是一个靠北的郡，放眼看去，是黄昏笼罩下的一片荒野，四周全是山。我的后面和左右都是荒野，从我脚下的深谷望去，是连绵不断的山峰。这里肯定人烟稀少，因为路上根本看不到一个行人。一条条道路，蜿蜒地伸向东、西、南、北各个方向，苍白、宽广而又孤独。它们被荒野拦腰截住，路边疯狂地长满了茂密的欧石楠。偶尔也会有一两个行人经过。我现在不希望他们看到我。如果让他们看见，他们肯定会很奇怪，我像一个路标一样停留在这儿，到底要干什么。那一刻我迷失了自己，毫无方向。他们也许会来问我，但我只会说一些在他们看来很荒唐而不可信的话。那个时候，我和人类社会完全脱节了，没有任何希望可以给我指明我的同类在哪里，也没有人看到我时会有一个善良的念头或对我表达美好的祝福；那个时候，除了我们共同的母亲——大自然，我没有任何亲人，我将寻找她温暖的怀抱，渴望从中得到一丝慰藉。

我径直走进欧石楠丛，看见棕色的荒原边上有一条深陷的沟壑，便一直沿着它往前走去，穿行在没膝的青色树丛中，顺着一个个弯道拐了弯，在一个隐蔽的角落找到了一块布满青苔的花岗岩，在底下坐了下来。我周围是荒原高高的边沿，头上的岩石保护着我，再上面是天空。

当我在这种地方，心情平静下来的时候，已经过去了一段时间。我隐约地害怕会有野牛隐藏在附近，有某个狩猎者或偷猎者发现我。一阵风吹来，吹起了阵阵荒草，我警觉地抬头看，唯恐野牛扑过来。鸻鸟的低鸣，我也想象成了人的声音。但发现一切担忧都只不过是庸人自扰。随着夜幕的降临，沉默就成了主宰者，这让我镇静了下来，也自信了许多。但我不能够思索，我只能聆听，只能警觉地观察，只能恐惧和害怕，现在我又可以思考了。

我该怎么办？往哪儿去？当我对任何事情都无能为力、不知道该往哪儿去的时候，这是一个多么让人难以忍受的问题！我必须要靠疲惫而颤动的双腿走到有人烟的地方，我需要靠祈求才能赢得别人冷冷的善心，得到一处栖息之地，我也必须靠诉说我的经历来赚取别人勉强的同情，满足我的需要。

我碰了一下欧石楠，干干的，还带着夏日的余温。我仰望着天空，天空是那么晴朗，星星在山坳的上空和善地眨着眼睛。露水出来了，带着吉祥的温柔。没有一丝风。大自然对我是仁慈、和善的，我想她是爱着我的，尽管我现在成了流浪人；我可以像子女对母亲一样地孝顺她，而我从人类那里得到的只是相互猜疑、抛弃、侮辱。今天晚上，我将会成为她的客人，因为我是她的孩子，我的母亲将不计金钱、不计较价格地收留我。我还剩下一小口面包，那是我中午经过镇子的时候，用我最后的一分钱买的。已经熟了的越橘，就像欧石楠上的水珠一样，处处闪着光芒。我摘了一小撮，就着面包吃了下去。我比以前更饿了，幸好这顿隐士的饭菜可以暂时满足它。吃完饭后，我又做了祷告，随后就找了个地方躺了下来。

峭壁旁边的欧石楠长得很茂密。我一躺下，双脚便陷了进去，两边的石楠高高竖起，只留下很窄的一块地方要受夜气侵袭。我把披肩对折，铺在身上作被子，把一个长满青苔的低矮小墩当枕头。我就这么住下了，至少在夜刚来临时，没觉得冷。

我本可以快快乐乐地睡上一觉，只是心痛得无法入睡。它哭诉着张开的伤口、流血的内心和折断的琴弦；它在为罗切斯特和他的不幸颤抖，对他报以深深的同情；它对他有着无尽的渴望，尽管像断了翅膀的小鸟那样无能为力，却仍旧抖动着断翅，徒劳地找寻着他。

这种想法把我折磨得疲惫不堪，我只好把腿蜷了起来。夜幕降临，她的星辰升起来了，多么安全而又安静的夜晚啊！安静得让人有些害怕。我们知道上帝无处不在，但当他的作品最大限度地展现在我们面前的时候，我们才最能感受到他的存在。在万里无云的夜空中，在他的宇宙无声地滚滚向前的地方，我们清楚地看到了他的无边无涯，他的万能，他的无处不在。我跪起来为罗切斯特先生祈祷，抬起头，含着泪水，泪眼婆娑地看着浩渺的银河。一想起银河是什么——那里有无数的星系像一道微光那么扫过太空——我便感到了上帝的巨大力量。我确信他有能力拯救他的创造物，更相信无论是地球，还是他所珍爱的一个灵魂，都不会毁灭。我开始感恩，感谢生命的源泉，也感谢精神的救赎。罗切斯特先生会安然无恙，因为他是上帝的，也必将受到上帝的保护。我再次投入小山的怀抱，不久，在沉睡中忘掉了忧愁。

但第二天，需求苍白而赤裸地向我走来。那个时候，小鸟早已离开它们的巢穴，蜜蜂也早已开始了一天辛勤的工作，忙着在露水未干之前采摘欧石楠的花蜜，早晨长长的影子缩短了，太阳普照大地和天空，我起来了，朝四周看了看。

多么安静和炎热的天气啊！金色沙漠上，荒野无限延伸着，太阳光照耀着每一寸土地。我希望我能生活在其中，能在这里活下来。我看到一条蜥蜴在峭壁上蠕动着，一只蜜蜂在越橘丛中忙碌地采蜜。我此刻愿意变成一条蜥蜴或一只蜜蜂，那样我就可以在这里找到合适的食物和永久的避难所。但我是一个人，有着人类的向往，我不能在这个不能满足我任何要求的地方久待。想到这里，我站了起来，看了看我刚刚离开的“床”。未来毫无希望，真的希望上帝能在我熟睡的时候，把我的灵魂收回去。但愿我这疲乏的身躯能因为死亡而摆脱与命运的进一步搏斗；但愿它此刻无声无息地腐烂，平静地与这荒原的泥土融为一体。但生命还是属于我的，我还拥有生命的所有要求、所有痛苦和所有责任。我必须背起包袱，满足生命的需求，忍受人生的痛苦，也必须履行某种责任。因此我又出发了。

我又回到了惠特克劳斯，那时太阳炽热地照射着大地，我沿着与太阳方向相反的一条路走着。我不知道自己该怎么办。我觉得已经走了好长时间的路，自己也已经筋疲力尽，我需要休息一下了，我就坐在附近的石头上，毫无办法地感受着心灵和四肢的疲惫。就在这时，钟声传来，那是教堂的钟声。

于是我就转向声音传来的方向前进。在那边，在我一个小时以前还不会去注意的富有浪漫色彩的群山中，我看到了村庄和耸立的尖塔。我左侧的山谷满眼都是牧地、玉米地和树林。一条闪光的小溪弯弯曲曲地流过深浅不一的绿荫，流过正在成熟的稻谷，暗淡的树林，明净而充满阳光的草地。辘辘的车轮声把我的思绪拉到了面前的路上，我看见一辆载着重物的车子正在往山上移动，不远处是两头牛和它们的主人。人类生活和人类劳作就在眼前了。我必须努力，努力地活下去，努力地像其他人那样去劳作。

大约下午两点，我进了村庄。在一条街道的尽头有一个小商店，商店的橱窗里放了些面包。我很想得到一块，有那样一块点心，我也许还能恢复一点力气，如果再没有吃的，我实在是无法往前走了。一回到人群中，我心头又升起了要恢复精力的愿望。

我觉得因为饥饿昏倒在一个小村的大路上是很丢脸的事情。难道我身上就连换取几块面包的东西都没有了吗？我绞尽脑汁地想着。我脖子上围有一小块丝绸围巾，还有一副手套。我难以表达贫困潦倒中的男女是怎么度日的。我不知道这两件东西是否会被人接受。可能他们不会要，但我还是要试一试。

我走进了小商店，里面有一个女人。她看见进来我这样一位穿着体面的人，肯定猜想我是位贵妇，于是很有礼貌地走上前来。她会怎么接待我呢？我羞愧难当。我的舌头好像打了结一样，迟迟未说出我事先准备好的请求。我不敢拿出半旧的手套，皱巴巴的围巾。另外，我还觉得这很荒唐。我只求她让我坐一会儿，因为我累了。她原以为来了一位顾客，现在却没有，于是很失望，就冷冷地同意了我的请求。她指了指一个座位，我一屁股坐了下来。我很想哭，但意识到那种表现会不合情理，便忍住了。我立刻问她：“村子里有没有裁缝或者做一般针线活的女人？”

“有两三个。按活计算也就够多的了。”

我沉思了一下。现在我不得不直说了。我已经面临困境，落到了没有食物、没有朋友、没有一文钱的地步。我得想点办法。什么办法呢？我要上某个地方去求助。上哪个地方呢？

“你知道附近有什么地方需要用人吗？”

“不，我不知道。”

“这个地方的主要行业是什么？大多数人靠什么为生？”

“有些是农场工，还有很多人在奥利弗先生的针厂和铸造厂工作。”

“奥利弗先生雇用女工吗？”

“不，那是男人的活。”

“那么女人干什么呢？”

“我说不上来。”对方回答，“有的干这个，有的干那个，穷人总得想方设法把日子过下去呀。”

她似乎对我的问题不耐烦了，确实，我有什么权利追问她呢？这时进来了一两位邻居，很明显我的椅子需要给别人用了，我起身告辞了。

我一边在街道上走着，一边打量着街道两旁的房屋；但我却没有找到一个理由或借口可以让我进入其中一座。我在村庄里漫无目的地游荡，有时候走得远一点，然后又回来了，这样反反复复了一个小时或更多。我太疲惫了，又非常地想吃东西，于是我只好转向路边的草地，在一个篱笆下面坐了下来。坐了没几分钟，我重新站了起来，继续去找食物，或者至少打听到一点消息。草地的高处有一所漂亮的小房子，它的前面有一处花园，非常整齐，一派欣欣向荣的景象。我在它跟前停了下来。走近这所白色的大门或按下闪光的门铃，门开了以后，我要干什么呢？我用什么样的方式才能让这里的居住者想帮助我呢？但我还是走近了它，按下了门铃。一个面目和善、穿着干净的年轻女人打开了门。我用一个内心绝望、身体虚弱的人那种可怜低沉、吞吞吐吐的声音问她需不需要一个用人。

“不要，”她说，“我们不雇用人。”

“你能告诉我，哪儿能找到工作吗？”我继续问，“我是个外乡人，在本地朋友不多，我想找份工作，什么样的都行。”

但为我操心找一个落脚的地方不是她的责任。还有，在她看来，我的身份、地位、叙述是多么可疑，她摇了摇头，表示不能为我提供任何信息，随后，白色的门轻轻地、很有礼貌地合上了，但毕竟把我关在了门外。要是她再晚一会儿关门，我相信我准会向她讨点面包，因为现在我已到了十分落魄的地步了。

我不能再回那个冷血的村子了，在那里，我根本就没有希望得到任何帮助。我本想绕道去一个看得见的不远的林子里。那里浓荫盖地，似乎有可能提供合适的落脚地点。但是我那么虚弱，那么为生理的渴求所折磨，本能使我只绕着有机会得到食品的住处转。当饥饿像猛禽一样嘴爪俱下抓住我时，孤独也不称其孤独，歇息也谈不上歇息了。

我走近了住宅，然后又离开了，接着又返回来，接下来又是徘徊。然而总会被一种意识所击退，觉得没有理由提出要求，没有权利期望别人对我孤独的命运发生兴趣。我像一条迷路的饿狗那样转来转去，一直到了下午，我穿过田野的时候，看到前面的教堂尖顶，便急步朝它走去。靠近教堂院子和一个花园的中间，有一所虽然不大但建造得很好的房子，我确信那是牧师的住所，我想起来，陌生人到了一个无亲无故的地方，想找份工作，有时会去找牧师引荐和提供帮助。给那些希望自立的人帮忙，至少是出主意，是牧师分内的事儿。我似乎有某种权利上那儿去求主意。于是我鼓起勇气，集中起一点点残留的力气，奋力往前走去。我到了房子跟前，敲了敲厨房的门。一位老妇人开了门，我问她这是不是牧师的住所。

“是的。”

“牧师在吗？”

“没有。”

“很快会回来吗？”

“不，他出门了。”

“去很远的地方？”

“不太远——有三英里。他父亲突然去世被叫回去了，他现在在沼泽居，很可能在那儿要待上两周。”

“家里的女主人在吗？”

“没有，除了我没有别人，我是管家。”读者呀，我没颜面求她帮我摆脱越陷越深的困境，而我又不能乞讨，于是我再次退缩了。

我再次取下围巾，就又想起了小商店里的面包。哎，能换一小片面包也好啊！就是一口，也能减轻饥饿的折磨。我本能地又看了一眼村庄，我又看到了那家商店，于是我走了进去。尽管当时除了那个女人，还有别的人在里面，我还是鼓起勇气问道：“我能用这条围巾换一个面包卷吗？”

她显然满腹狐疑地看着我：“不，我从来不那么卖东西。”

在几乎走投无路之中，我央求她换半个也可以，可是她再次拒绝了。“我怎么知道你从什么地方弄来的围巾？”她说。

“那这副手套呢？”

“不行，我要它干什么？”

读者啊，沉湎于这些细节是一件让人不愉快的事情。有人说回忆过去痛苦的经历是一种享受，但即使在今天，我也不忍再去回想那个时期，人格上的屈辱夹杂着身体上的痛苦，构成了那段不堪回首的往事。我不怨恨任何一个拒绝帮助我的人，我认为他们那样做是情理之中的，是不自觉的行为。一个普通的乞丐是被怀疑的对象，一个衣着华丽的乞丐也必然如此。我想讨一份工作，但是给我提供一份工作是他们的职责吗？不，当然不是！他们只不过是第一次见到我、对我的性格一无所知的陌生人。对于那个不能接受我的围巾换面包的妇人，那也是可以理解的，如果在她看来我的提议居心叵测，或是这桩交换无利可图，那她的做法也是不错的。让我长话短说吧，我讨厌这个话题。

天快黑的时候，我经过一家农户。一位农夫正坐在敞开着的门口，吃着面包和奶酪。我停住对他说：

“能给我一片面包吗？我实在饿得慌。”他惊异地看了我一眼，二话没说，便切了一厚片面包给我。我估计他并不认为我是个乞丐，而只是一位性格怪僻的贵妇，看中了他的黑面包。走到望不见他屋子的地方，我便坐下，狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。

既然无望投宿人家，我只好去我早先提到的那个小树林里过夜。但那个晚上糟糕透了，我的休息泡汤了。那天地上湿漉漉的，天气很冷；此外，不止一次地有人从我身边走过，因此我不得不一次又一次地更换“住处”，这让我很没有安全感，内心也无法安静下来。因为早上下了雨，第二天一整天都很潮湿。读者啊，不要再问我那天的任何事情了。像以前一样我努力地寻找工作，一次次地被拒绝，仍然饿着肚子，但有一次食物却到了我嘴边。在一家农舍的门口，我看到一个小女孩准备把冻了的粥倒进猪槽里。

我赶忙问：“能把它给我吗？”

她瞪着我。“妈妈！”她嚷道，“有个女的要我把粥给她。”

“行啊，孩子，”里边的一个声音回答，“要是她是个乞丐，那就给了她吧，反正猪也不会吃的。”

这女孩把结了冰的粥倒在我手上，我狼吞虎咽地吃掉了。

湿润的夜色越来越浓，我在一条偏僻的马道上走了一个多小时后停了下来。

“我快撑不住了，”我自言自语地说，“自己觉得走不了多远了。难道今晚又没有地方投宿？雨下得这么大，难道我又得把头靠在阴冷湿透的地面上吗？我担心自己别无选择了。谁肯接纳我呢？带着这种饥饿、昏眩、寒冷、凄楚的感觉和一种绝望的心情，那着实可怕。不过很可能我挨不到早上就会死去。那么我为什么不能心甘情愿地死掉呢？为什么我还要挣扎着维持没有价值的生命？因为我知道，或是相信，罗切斯特先生还活着，另外，死于饥寒是天性所不能默认的命运。啊，上天呀！再支撑我一会儿！帮助我，指引我吧！”

我那呆滞的眼睛徘徊在暗沉沉、雾蒙蒙的山水之间。我发现自己已远离村庄，因为它已在我视线中消失，村子周围的耕地也不见了。我已经穿小径、抄近路再次靠近了一大片荒原。此刻，在我与黑黝黝的小山之间，只有几小片田野，几乎没有被开垦过，和原来的欧石楠几乎一样荒芜和贫瘠。

“我宁可死在更远一点的地方，也不愿意死在街道上或人来人往的路上。”我沉思着，“让乌鸦和渡鸦——要是那些地区有渡鸦的话——啄我骨头上的肉也比装在贫民院的棺材里或乞丐的墓穴里要强。”

随后我折向那座小山，到了那里。现在就只剩找个能躺下来的地方了，就算并不安全，至少也是隐蔽的。可是荒原的表面看上去都一样平坦，只是色彩上有些差别；灯芯草和苔藓茂密生长的湿地呈青色，而只长欧石楠的干土壤是黑色的。虽然夜越来越黑，但我仍能看清这些差别，尽管它不过是光影的交替，因为颜色已经随日光退尽了。

我的目光仍在暗淡的高地游弋，沿着在最荒凉的景色中消失的荒原边缘逡巡。这时，远在沼泽和山脊之中，一个模糊的点，一道光跃入我眼帘。“那是鬼火。”这是我第一个想法，我估计它会立即消失。然而，那光继续亮着，显得很稳定，既不后退，也不前进。“难道是刚点燃的篝火？”我产生了疑问。我注视着，看它会不会扩散。但没有，它既不缩小，也不扩大。“这也许是一间房子里的烛光。”我随后猜想着，“即便那样，我也永远到不了那儿了。它离这儿太远，可就是离我一码远，又有什么用？我只会敲门，开门，门又当着我的面关上。”

我就在站立的地方颓然倒下，把头埋进地里，静静地躺了一会儿。夜风刮过小山，吹过我的身体，呜咽着在远处消失。雨下得很大，很重，把我彻底浇透了。要是这么冻成了冰块——友好地麻木而死——雨点也许还会那么敲击着，而我会毫无感觉。可是我依然活着的肉体，在寒气的侵袭下颤抖，不久我只好站了起来。

那边的光仍然若隐若现，在雨中显得那么模糊和遥远。我试着继续往前走，拖着疲乏的双腿慢慢地朝它走去。它引导我穿过一个宽阔的泥沼，迂回地上了山。要是在冬天，这个泥沼是没法通过的，就是眼下盛夏，也是泥浆四溅，一步一摇晃。我跌倒了两次，两次都爬了起来，振作起精神。那道光是我渺茫的希望，我必须赶到那里。

穿过沼泽我看到荒原上有一条白印子，我向它走去，见是一条大路或是小径，直通那道正从树丛中一个小土墩上射来的光。在昏暗中从树形和树叶能分辨出，那显然是杉木树丛。我一走近，我的星星便不见了，原来某些障碍把它和我隔开了，我伸出手在面前一团漆黑中摸索。我辨认出了一堵矮墙的粗糙石头——上面像是一道栅栏，里面是高而带刺的篱笆。我继续往前摸。那白色东西又在我面前闪光了，原来是一扇门——一扇旋转门，我一碰便在铰链上转了起来。门两边各有一丛黑黑的灌木——是冬青或是紫杉。

进了门，走过灌木，眼前便现出了一所房子的剪影，又黑又矮却相当长。但是那道引路的光却消失了，一切都模模糊糊。难道屋里的人都休息了？我担心准是这样。我换了一个地方去找门，那里又闪起了令人心仪的灯光，是从大约一尺长的一扇格子小窗的菱形玻璃上射出来的，那扇窗因为常青藤或是满墙的爬藤类植物的叶子，显得更小了。留下的空隙那么小，又覆盖得那么好，窗帘和百叶窗似乎都没有必要了。我弯腰撩开窗户上浓密的小枝条，里面的一切便看得清清楚楚了。我能看得清房间的沙子地板擦得干干净净。还有一个核桃木餐具柜，上面放着一排排锡盘，映出了燃烧着泥炭的红光。我能看得见一只钟表、一张白色的松木桌和几把椅子，桌子上点着一根蜡烛，烛光一直是我的灯塔。一个看上去有些粗糙，但也像她周围的一切那样一尘不染的老妇人，借着烛光在编织袜子。

我只是粗略地看了看这些东西——并没有什么特别的地方。令我更感兴趣的是火炉旁的人，在洋溢着玫瑰色的宁静和暖意中默默地坐着。两个年轻高雅的女子——从各方面看都像大家闺秀——一个坐在低低的摇椅里，另一个坐在一条更矮的凳子上。两人都穿戴了黑纱和毛葛织成的重丧服，暗沉沉的服饰格外烘托出她们白皙的脖子和面孔。一只大猎狗把它巨大无比的头靠在一个姑娘膝头，另一个姑娘的膝头则偎着一只黑猫。

这间简陋的厨房里居然有这样两个人存在，真是奇怪。她们会是谁呢？肯定不可能是桌子旁边那个妇人的女儿，因为她显得很土气，而她们却很高雅而有涵养。我没有在别的地方见过这两个人，但是仔细看看她们，她们脸上的每个特征都是那么熟悉。她们算不上漂亮——她们太苍白，太严肃，够不上这个词。两人都低头看着书，若有所思，甚至还有些严肃。她们之间的架子上放着第二根蜡烛和两大卷书，两人不时地翻阅着，似乎还在与手中的小书作比较，像是在查阅词典，翻译什么似的。这一刻静得仿佛所有人都成了影子，生了火的房间活像一幅画。这儿是那么静谧，我都能听到煤渣从炉栅上落下的声音，昏暗的角落里时钟的滴答声，我甚至想象我能分辨出那女人咔嗒咔嗒的编织声，因而当一个嗓音终于打破奇怪的宁静时，我足以听得分明。

“听着，黛安娜，”两位全神贯注的女子中的一位说，“弗朗茨和老丹尼尔晚上在一起。弗朗茨正在说一个梦，这个梦刚把他给吓醒——听！”她声音放得很低，读了什么东西，我连一个字也没听懂，因为那是一种完全陌生的语言——既不是法语，也不是拉丁语。是希腊语还是德语，我无法判断。

“那说得很有力，”她念完后说，“我很欣赏。”另一位抬头听着她姐妹说的话，一面凝视炉火，一面又重复了刚才读过的一行。后来，我知道了这种语言和这本书，所以我在这里引用几行，尽管我当初听来，仿佛是敲在铜器上的响声——不传达任何意义：

“‘有一个人走了出来，其外貌犹如夜晚的星星。’妙！妙！”她大声嚷着，乌黑、深沉的眼睛里闪着光芒。“你面前恰好站了一位模糊而伟大的天使！这一行胜过一百页浮华的文章。‘我在我愤怒的天平中，权衡这种思想，我用我激怒的砝码，权衡这个作品。[1]’我喜欢它！”

两人又沉默了。

“有哪个国家的人是这么说话的？”那老妇人停下手头的编织，抬头问道。

“有的，汉娜——一个比英国大得多的国家，那里的人都这么说。”

“噢，说真的，我不知道他们之间怎么交流，要是你们当中任何一个人去那儿，我想你们能听懂他们说的话，对吧？”

“他们说的我们也许能听懂一部分，不是全部都懂——汉娜，我们没有你想象的那么聪明。我们不会说德语，离开了词典的帮助，我们连读德文书都不会。”

“那这对你们有什么好处吗？”

“某一天我们想教别人德语——或者像他们说的，至少教基础德语，这样我们会比现在赚更多的钱。”

“很可能，不过今晚你们读得够多了。该休息了。”

“我想也是，至少我有些累了，玛丽，你呢？”

“累极了，没有老师，只靠一部词典来学一门语言，毕竟是吃力的工作。”

“是呀，尤其是像德语这样艰涩而难学的语言。我想知道圣·约翰什么时候回家？”

“肯定不会太长时间了，现在刚好十点。”

她从腰带间掏出一只小小的金表来，看了一眼。

“雨下得很大，汉娜。劳烦你照看一下客厅里的火炉好吗？”

那妇人站起来，开了门。从门外望进去，我依稀看到了一条过道。不一会儿我听她在内间拨着火，她马上又返回了。

“哦，孩子们！”她说，“这会儿进那边的房间真让我难受。椅子空空的，都靠后摆在角落里，看上去很冷清。”

她用围裙揩了揩眼睛，两位先前神情严肃的姑娘这时也伤心起来。

“不过他现在在一个更好的地方了，”汉娜继续说，“我们不该再盼望他再次回到这里。而且，谁也不会比他死得更安详了。”

“你说他从没提起过我们？”一位小姐问。

“他来不及提，孩子，你们的父亲一下子就去了。像前一天一样，他一直有点痛，但不严重。圣·约翰先生问他，是否要派人去叫你们两个中的一个回来，你们的父亲还笑他呢。第二天，他的头开始有点沉——那是两周以前——后来他睡过去了，再也没有醒来。你们的哥哥进房间看他的时候，发现他差不多已经咽气了。哦，孩子们！那是最后一个老派人了——你们和圣·约翰先生好像跟过世的那些人不属于同一种类型；尽管你们比较像你们的母亲，因为她像你们一样读过很多书。玛丽，你更像她，黛安娜更像你们的父亲。”

我认为她们彼此很像，看不出老仆人（这会儿我断定她是这种身份）所见的区别。两人都是皮肤白皙，身材苗条。两人的脸部都很有特征，一副聪明的模样。当然一位的头发颜色比另一位要深些，发式也不一样。玛丽的浅褐色头发两边分开，梳成了光光的辫子，黛安娜的深色头发梳成粗厚的发卷，遮盖着脖子。时钟敲了十点。

“你们肯定饿了，”汉娜说，“圣·约翰先生要是回来了也会一样。”

她忙着去准备晚饭了。两位小姐立起身来，似乎正要走开，到客厅去。在这之前我一直目不转睛地看着她们，她们的外表和谈话引起了我强烈的兴趣，我竟把自己的痛苦处境忘掉了一半。这会儿却重新想了起来，与她们一比，我的境遇就更凄凉、更绝望了。要打动房子里的人让她们来关心我，相信我的需要和悲苦都是真的并说动她们为我提供一个栖身之处，是多么不现实呀！我摸到门边，迟疑地敲起来，我觉得自己后一个念头不过是妄想。汉娜开了门。

“你有什么事？”她一面借着手中的烛光打量我，一面带着惊异的声调问。

“我可以跟女主人说话吗？”我说。

“你还是告诉我你有什么话要跟她们讲吧，你从哪儿来的？”

“我是一个外乡人。”

“这时候来这里干什么？”

“我想在外间或者什么地方借宿一个晚上，还想向你讨点东西吃。”

汉娜脸上出现了我所担心的那种怀疑的表情。“我可以给你一片面包，”她稍微停顿了一下说，“但我们不收流浪者过夜。那不妥当。”

“务必让我跟你的小姐们说说吧。”

“不行，我不允许。她们能替你做什么呢？你这会儿不要在这儿游荡了，天气看来很糟糕。”

“但你把我赶走，我能上哪儿去呢？我又能怎么办呢？”

“哼，我保证你知道上哪儿去，也知道该干什么？当心别干坏事就行啦。这是一个便士，你走吧！”

“一便士不能填饱肚子，而我已经没有力气赶路了。别关门！——啊，不要，看在上帝分上！”

“我必须这么做，雨打进来了。”

“通报一下小姐们吧，让我见见她们。”

“说真的，我不会这么做的。你不守本分，要不你不会这么吵吵嚷嚷的。走吧！”

“可是把我赶走，我准会死掉的。”

“你才不会呢。我担心你打着什么坏主意，所以才深更半夜到人家房子里来，要是你有什么同伙——强入住宅打劫的那一类人——就在附近，你可以告诉他们，房子里不光是我们这几个人，我们还有一位先生，还有几只狗和几条枪。”说到这儿，这位老实却执拗的用人关了门，在里面上了闩。

这下子可是倒霉透顶了。一阵剧痛——彻底绝望的痛苦——充溢并撕裂了我的心。其实我已经衰弱不堪，再往前跨一步的力气都没有了。我颓然倒在潮湿的门前台阶上。我呻吟着——绞着手——极度痛苦地哭了起来。啊，死亡的幽灵！啊，这最后的一刻来得那么恐怖！哎呀，这种孤独——那样从同类中被驱逐！不要说希望消失了，就连刚强精神立足的地方也不见了——至少有一会儿是这样。但后者，我马上又努力恢复了。

“我只能死了，”我说，“而我相信上帝，让我默默地等待他的意旨吧。”

这些话我不仅脑子里想了，而且还把它说出了口，我把一切痛苦又驱回心里，竭力强迫它留在那里，安安静静地不出声。

“所有人都是会死的，”离我很近的一个声音说道，“但并不是所有人都注定要像你这样，慢悠悠受尽折磨而早死的，要是你就这么死于饥渴的话。”

“是谁或者什么东西在说话？”我问道，一时被突如其来的声音吓了一跳。此刻我不会对发生的任何事情寄予得救的希望。一个影子移近了——究竟什么影子，漆黑的夜和衰弱的视力使我难以分辨。这位新来者在门上重重地长时间敲了起来。

“是你吗，圣·约翰先生？”汉娜问道。

“是的，快开门。”

“哎呀，这么个狂风暴雨的夜晚，你准是又湿又冷吧！快进来！你的妹妹们正为你担心，而且我相信附近有坏人。有一个女乞丐——我敢说她肯定还没有走呢！就躺在那里。快起来！真不害臊！我说你走吧！”

“嘘，汉娜！我有话对这个女人说。你把她挡在门外已经尽到了你的职责，这会儿让我来尽我的职责让她进来。我就在附近，听到了你说的，也听了她说的。我想这情况特殊——我至少得了解一下。年轻的女人，起来吧，走在我前面，进屋去吧。”

我困难地照他的话办了。不久我就站在干净、明亮的厨房里了——就在炉子跟前——浑身发抖，病得厉害。我知道自己被风吹雨打，头发蓬乱，样子极其可怕。两位小姐，她们的哥哥圣·约翰先生和老仆人都呆呆地注视着我。

“圣·约翰，这是谁？”我听见她们其中的一个问。

“我也不知道，我在门口发现她的。”那人回答。

“她脸色真苍白。”汉娜说。

“像泥土或死人一样白，”对方回答，“她要昏倒了，让她坐着吧。”

说真的我的脑袋昏昏沉沉的。我倒了下去，但一把椅子接住了我。尽管我说不了话，但神志是清醒的。

“也许喝点水会使她恢复过来。汉娜，拿点水来。不过她瘦得不成样子了。多瘦啊，一点血色也没有！”

“简直是个幽灵。”

“她是病了，还是饿坏了？”

“我想是饿坏了吧。汉娜，那是牛奶吗？给我吧，再给我一片面包。”

黛安娜（我是在她朝我弯下身子，看到垂在我与火炉之间的长鬈发知道的）掰下了一块面包，在牛奶里浸了一浸，送进我嘴里。她的脸紧挨着我，在她脸上我看到了一种怜悯的表情，从她急促的呼吸中我感受到了她的同情。她用朴素的话说出了满腔温情：“尽量吃一点吧。”

“是呀——尽量吃一点。”玛丽和气地重复着，从我头上摘去了湿透的草帽，把我的头托起来。我尝了尝她们给我的东西，先是有气无力，但马上便急不可耐地吃了起来。

“刚开始别让她吃得太多——控制一下，”哥哥说，“她已经吃得够多了。”于是他端走了那杯牛奶和那盘面包。

“再让她吃一点点吧，圣·约翰——瞧她眼睛里贪婪的样子。”

“暂时不要给她吃了，妹妹。试试她能不能说话，问问她的名字。”

我觉得自己能说话了，而且回答：“我的名字叫简·爱略特。”因为仍急于避免被人发现，我早就决定用化名了。

“你家在什么地方，你的朋友在哪里？”

我没有吭声。

“我们可以把你认识的人找来吗？”

我摇了摇头。

“你能说说你自己的事儿吗？”

不知怎的，我一跨进门槛，一被带到这家主人面前，就不再觉得自己无家可归，到处流浪，被广阔的世界所抛弃了。我就敢于扔掉行乞的行当——恢复我本来的举止和个性。我再次开始了解自己。圣·约翰要我谈一下自己的事时，我稍稍顿了一顿后说，眼下我体质太弱没法儿讲——

“先生，今晚我没法给你细讲了。”

“不过，”他说，“那么你希望我们为你做些什么呢？”

“不用。”我回答。我的力气只够我做这样简要的回答。

黛安娜接过了话：“你的意思是，”她问，“你需要的帮助，我们现在都已经给了你了？我们就可以把你打发到荒原和雨夜中去了？”

我看了看她。我想她的脸很出众，洋溢着力量和善意。我蓦地鼓起勇气，对她满是同情的目光报以微笑。我说：“我相信你们，假如我是一条迷路的丧家犬，我知道你们今天晚上也不会把我从火炉旁撵走。其实，我真的并不害怕。随你们怎么对待我和照应我吧，但请原谅我不能讲得太多——我有些气短——一讲话就痉挛。”三个人都仔细打量着我，都不说话。

“汉娜，”圣·约翰先生终于说，“这会儿就让她坐在那里吧，别问她问题。十分钟后把剩下的牛奶和面包给她。玛丽和黛安娜，我们到客厅去，好好商量一下这件事。”

他们出去了，很快一位小姐又回来了——我分不出是哪一位，我坐在暖融融的火炉边时，一种恍惚的快感悄悄地流遍我全身。她低声吩咐了汉娜。没多久，在用人的帮助下，我挣扎着登上楼梯，脱去了湿淋淋的衣服，很快躺在一张温暖干燥的床上。我感谢了上帝——在难以言说的疲惫中感受到了一丝感激的喜悦——便睡着了。

第二十九章


接下来的三天三夜，我脑子里的记忆是模糊的。我能回忆起那段时间些许的感觉，但形不成什么想法，也没有任何动作。我知道我在一个小屋里面，躺在一张小床上。我似乎长在这张小床上了，像块石头一样躺在上面一动不动。把我从那儿拉走，就像要我的命一样。我没有注意时间的流逝——不在乎上午转为下午、下午转为晚上的变化。我观察进入或离开房间的任何一个人，甚至还能分辨出他们是谁，我还能听懂别人在我身旁所说的话，但回答不上来。动嘴唇与动手脚一样是不可能的事情。用人汉娜是我这个房间的常客，她的到来打扰了我。我有一种感觉，她希望我走。她不了解我或我的处境，对我持有偏见。黛安娜和玛丽每天来房间看我一两次。她们会在我的床前悄悄说类似这样的话：

“幸好我们把她收留下来了。”

“是啊。如果她在外面待上一整夜，第二天早上起来肯定会被发现死在门口了。我真想知道她究竟经历了什么事情。”

“我想是很离奇的苦难吧——消瘦、苍白、可怜的流浪者！”

“从她的行为方式看，我想她应该是个有教养的人。她的口音非常纯正；尽管她脱下来的衣服都弄湿了并且还溅上了泥巴，但还不算旧并且做工精致。”

“她的脸很奇特，尽管皮包骨头又很憔悴，但我比较喜欢这种类型。我可以想象当她健康而有活力的时候，这是一张多么讨人喜欢的脸啊！”

在她们的交谈中，我从来没有听到她们说过一句对自己的好客表示懊悔，或者对我表示怀疑或厌恶的话。我得到了安慰。

圣·约翰先生只来过一次，他瞧着我，说我昏睡不醒是长期疲劳过度的反应。他还说没有必要去请医生，他确信最好是顺其自然。他说我的每一根神经都在某种程度上过度紧张，所以整个机体功能必须沉睡麻痹一阵子。他说我没有病，他还说一旦麻痹期一过，我会恢复得很快。这些看法，短短的几句话，安静而低沉的语调就把它们说了出来。停顿了一会儿，他又说道：“一张与众不同的面相，却没有低俗或堕落的迹象。”

“恰恰相反，”黛安娜回答，“说实话，圣·约翰，我内心对这可怜的小幽灵产生了好感。但愿我们永远能够帮助她。”

“这不大可能，”对方回答，“你会发现她是某个年轻小姐，只是与自己的朋友产生了误会而离家出走的。如果她不固执，我们也许可以把她送回她朋友的身边。但是我注意到了她脸上强有力的线条，我怀疑她的脾气很倔犟。”他站着端详了我一会儿，随后又说道：“她看上去很聪明，但不漂亮。”

“那是因为她病得很严重，圣·约翰。”

“不管身体好不好，反正长得很一般。那些五官缺少美的雅致与和谐。”

到了第三天，我身体好转了；到了第四天，我可以说话，走动，从床上坐起来，转动身子了。我想大约是晚饭的时候，汉娜给我端来了一些米粥和干面包。我津津有味地吃完，觉得这些东西很好吃，不像前两天发烧时，吃什么都没有味道。等她走开后，我感到很有力气，整个人也恢复了活力。在床上躺久了，我想换个姿势，也想起来运动运动；我想起床，但起床后，我穿什么衣服呢？我只有潮湿而沾满污泥的那身衣服，我就是穿着那件衣服在地上睡过，摔倒在沼泽里。穿成那样出现在我的救命恩人面前，我会感到丢人。

但我却发现，床边的椅子上放着我的衣物，既干净又干燥。我那黑丝的上衣正挂在墙上。泥沼的印迹已经洗去，潮湿留下的褶皱已经熨平，看上去很不错，我的鞋子和袜子已洗得干干净净，很像样。房子里有梳洗的工具，有一把梳子和一把刷子可以把头发梳理整齐。我疲乏地挣扎了一番，每隔五分钟休息一下，终于穿好了衣服。因为消瘦，衣服穿在身上很宽松，不过我用披肩掩盖了这个不足。于是我再一次清清爽爽、体体面面了；我扶着栏杆，爬下了石头楼梯，到了一条低矮窄小的过道，进了厨房。

厨房里充满了鲜面包的香味和火炉温暖的气息。汉娜正在烤面包。众所周知，偏见最不容易从未受过教育的心灵中根除。它就像长在石缝之间的种子，顽固而坚强。她刚看见我的时候，冷漠、僵硬；慢慢地，她的态度开始缓和了。当她看到我干净利索地出现在她面前的时候，她竟然笑了起来。

“哎呀，你怎么起来了？”她说，“这么说，你好些了。要是你愿意，你可以坐在炉边我的椅子上。”

她指了指那把摇椅，我坐了下来。她忙碌着，不时用眼角的余光瞟我。她一边从烤炉里取出面包，一面转向我直截了当地问道：

“你到这个地方来之前是乞丐吗？”

我当时很生气，但是知道生气解决不了问题，并且我也曾经像乞丐似的在她面前出现过，因此我用平静但却仍带着明显的强硬口气回答她：

“你把我错当成乞丐了，我不是什么乞丐，就像你或者你的女主人们不是乞丐一样。”

停顿片刻后她说：“那我就不大明白了，我看你没有房子也没有钱吧？”

“没有房子或钱并不一定是你说的乞丐呀？”

“你上过学吗？”她立刻问。

“上过，读过不少书。”

“那你肯定从来没有在寄宿学校待过吧？”

“我在寄宿学校待了八年。”

她立刻瞪大了眼睛，“那你做什么还养活不了自己啊？”

“我养活过自己，而且我相信以后还能养活自己。你要拿这些醋栗干什么？”看见她拎出一篮醋栗时我问道。

“做成酱。”

“给我吧，我帮你拣。”

“不用了，我不想让你帮忙做什么。”

“但我总得干点什么，还是让我来吧。”

她同意了，甚至还拿来一块干净的毛巾，一面铺在我衣服上一面说：“铺上它，别把你的衣服弄脏了。”

“你没有干惯用人的活吧，从你的手上我能看得出来，”她说，“你也许是个裁缝？”

“不是，你猜错了。现在不要管我以前怎样，也别为我的事情费脑筋，不过你能告诉我我们住的这所房子的名字吗？”

“有人叫它泽庄，有人叫它沼泽居。”

“住在这儿的那位先生叫圣·约翰先生？”

“不，他不住在这儿，他只是在这儿短居。他的家在莫尔顿教区那里。”

“是离这儿几英里远的村子吗？”

“是的。”

“他是从事什么职业的？”

“是位牧师。”

我记起了当我要求见牧师时，牧师公馆的老管家的回答。“这里是他父亲的居所吗？”

“是的。老里弗斯先生在这儿住过，还有他父亲、祖父及曾祖父。”

“那么，那位先生的名字是圣·约翰·里弗斯先生了。”

“对，圣·约翰是他受洗礼时的名字。”

“他的两个妹妹叫黛安娜·里弗斯和玛丽·里弗斯？”

“是的。”

“他们的父亲去世了？”

“三个星期前死于中风。”

“他们的母亲呢？”

“女主人已经去世多年了。”

“你在这家已经很长时间了吗？”

“我在这里三十年了，三个人都是我一手带大的。”

“那你肯定是一位老实可靠的仆人。尽管你曾经那么没有礼貌地把我当做乞丐，可我还是愿意说你的好话。”

她再次用吃惊的目光打量着我。“我相信，”她说，“我完全把你看错了，不过这里来往的骗子很多，你得原谅我。”

“而且，”我继续说，口气颇有些严厉，“你在一个不忍心把一条狗关在门外的晚上，竟然拒我于门外。”

“嗯，确实有些残忍。可是我又能怎么办呢？我想得更多的是孩子们而不是我自己，可怜的孩子们！除了我没有人照顾、关心他们，我要显得厉害些才好啊。”

我严肃地沉默了几分钟。

“你别把我想得太坏。”她又说。

“不过我确实把你想得很坏，”我说，“而且我告诉你为什么——不是因为你不许我投宿，或者把我看成了骗子，而是因为你刚才因为我没钱、没房子就责备我。有些好人像我一样穷得一个子儿也没有。如果你是个基督徒，你就不该把贫困当成一种罪过。”

“以后不会这样了，”她说，“圣·约翰先生也是这么和我说的。我知道自己错了——但是，我现在对你的看法跟以前明显不同了。你看来完全是个体面的小家伙。”

“那行了——我现在原谅你了，握一下手吧。”

她把沾了面粉的布满老茧的手放进我手里，粗糙的脸上闪过一个非常亲切的笑容，从那时起我们便成了朋友。

汉娜显然很健谈。当我拣果子，她和面准备做饼时，她继续和我说着关于过世的主人和女主人，以及她称作“孩子们”的年轻人的故事。

据汉娜讲，老里弗斯先生是一个再普通不过的人了，但他确实是一位绅士，有着古老的家族背景。在沼泽居还是一所小房子的时候，它就属于里弗斯家了。“大约有两百多个年头了。这所房子很小，很简陋，根本不能跟奥利弗先生的豪宅相提并论。但当奥利弗先生的父亲是一个走街串巷的卖针郎的时候，里弗斯家族已是亨利时代的贵族了，看看莫尔顿教堂法衣室记事簿，就都知道了，”她继续说道：“老主人喜欢一般人喜欢的工作，如狩猎、农耕等等。”女主人则不同。她读过很多书，也学习过不少东西，孩子们这点就像太太。附近都找不出第二家来，以前从来没有过。三个孩子差不多从他们刚会说话那会儿，就开始喜欢学习，他们一直都保持着这种习性。圣·约翰先生长大后上了大学，然后成为一名牧师。女孩子们一离开学校，就寻找地方当家庭教师，因为她们被告知老主人因为错信了人而损失了一大笔钱，破产了。老主人没有给她们留下什么遗产，她们只好自己养活自己。她们很长时间都不在家住，因为她们的父亲去世了，这才回来住几周。她们现在住在伦敦及其他大的城镇，但她们总说：去过那么多地方，没有一个地方能跟家比。而且，她们俩意气相投——从来没有翻过脸，也没有争吵过。她从来不知道哪儿还有这样团结一心的人家。

拣完了醋栗后，我问她：两位小姐和她们的哥哥上哪儿去了？

“去莫尔顿散步了，半小时内会回来吃茶点。”

他们在汉娜规定的时间内回来了，是从厨房门进来的。圣·约翰先生点点头，就从我身边走过去了。两位小姐则停了下来。玛丽和蔼而又冷静地用几句话表达了对我能下楼走动的喜悦，黛安娜握住我的手，对着我摇摇头。

“你该得到我们的允许后才好下楼，”她说，“你脸色还是很苍白——又那么瘦！可怜的孩子！——可怜的姑娘！”

黛安娜的声调在我听来像鸽子的咕咕声一样悦耳，她有一双我很乐意接触的眼睛。对我来说，她的整张脸都充满了无限的魅力。玛丽的面容，同样聪明——她的五官很漂亮，但她的表情比较冷淡，她的仪态虽然文雅却有一种距离感。黛安娜的神态和说话的样子都有一种权威感，显然很有个性。我天性喜欢屈服于她那样的权威；而且喜欢在我的良心和自尊心允许的情况下，服从积极的意志。

“你在这儿有什么事吗？”她继续说，“这不是你待的地方。玛丽和我有时在厨房里坐坐，因为在家里我们随便些，甚至有些放肆——但你是客人，得到客厅去。”

“我在这儿很舒服。”

“不是这样的，汉娜这么忙，说不定会把面粉撒到你身上。”

“另外，火炉对你来说也有些热。”玛丽插嘴说。

“没有错，”她姐姐补充说，“来吧，你得听话。”她一面握着我的手一面拉我起来，领进内室。

“坐那儿，”她说着把我安顿在沙发上，“等我们脱掉衣服，准备好茶点。这是我们在小小沼地上的家里行使的另一个特权——在我们高兴的时候，或者汉娜烤面包、酿酒、洗衣服或者熨烫衣服的时候，我们自己来做饭。”

她关了门，留下我与圣·约翰先生单独待着。他坐在我对面，手里捧着一本书或一张报纸。我先是打量了一下客厅，随后再看看它的主人。

客厅是一个小房间，装饰得一般，但干净、整洁，让人感觉很舒服。客厅里老式的椅子锃亮，核桃木的桌子看起来像是一块能照出人影的玻璃。略带污点的墙上挂着几幅奇怪而又古老的男人和女人画像。在一个装有玻璃门的橱柜里，放着几本书和一套古瓷器。除了放在书桌上的一对针线盒和青龙木女用书台，房间里没有多余的装饰品——没有一件现代家具。包括地毯和窗帘在内的一切，看上去虽陈旧却保养得很好。

圣·约翰在那坐着一动不动，就像挂在墙上布满灰尘的画像，眼睛一个劲儿地盯着他看的书，他的嘴唇闭着，很容易让我看个究竟。他要是想装成塑像，那是再容易不过的事情了。他很年轻，二十八到三十岁的样子，个子很高。他的脸庞，活像希腊人的脸，轮廓非常清晰，笔直的古典式鼻梁，和雅典人非常相像的嘴和下巴。说实话，很少有英国人的脸型长得像他这样酷似古典。他也许对我不规则的面貌有些吃惊，因为他自己的是那么和谐。他的眼睛又大又蓝，睫毛还是棕色的。高高的前额，像象牙一样洁白，额头上不经意披下了几绺金色的头发。

读者啊，这是不是一幅活生生的写真呢？然而画中的人给我的印象却并不属于那种温和忍让、容易打动甚至十分平静的个性。虽然他此刻默默地坐着，但我觉察到，他的鼻孔、嘴巴、额头有着某种东西，表现出内心的不安、冷酷或急切。他没有和我说一句话，甚至都没有看我一眼，直到他的妹妹们回来。黛安娜来来回回地准备茶点，给我带来了一块小蛋糕，那是在烤箱上面烤的。

“吃吧，”她说，“你肯定饿了。汉娜说从早饭到现在，你只喝了点粥。”

我没有拒绝，因为我的胃口确实大开，迫切需要吃东西。里弗斯先生现在合上书，在桌子旁边找了一个座位坐了下来，用那双画一般的蓝眼睛目不转睛地看着我。目光里有一种不拘礼节的直率，一种锐利、明确的坚定，说明他一直避开陌生人不是出于腼腆，而是故意的。

“你很饿，对不对？”他说。

“是的，先生。”这是我的行为方式，本身固有的行为方式，简问简答，直问直说。

“幸好前三天的低烧抑制了你的食欲，如果起初你这么暴饮暴食的话，就很危险了。现在你可以放心吃了，但也要节制才好。”

“我相信我吃你的不会吃很久的，先生。”这是我很笨拙、很粗鲁的回答。

“不，”他冷冷地说，“等你把朋友的住址告诉我们，我们可以给他们写信，你就又可以回家了。”

“我必须直率地告诉你们，我没有能力这么做，因为我既没有家，也没有朋友。”

三个人都看着我，但眼光中并没有不信任。我可以感觉得到，他们的眼神中没有怀疑，更多的是好奇，我这里尤其是指那些小姐们。圣·约翰的眼睛表面看起来很明亮，但却很难让人看穿。他的眼睛更多的是用来探测他人内心思想的工具，而不是来表达属于他自己的思想。眼神里热情与冷漠的交融，很大程度上不是为了鼓励别人，而是要使人感到窘迫。

“你的意思是说，”他问，“你没有任何亲戚朋友吗？”

“对。我和活着的任何人都没有联系，我也没有权利被英格兰的任何一个家庭接纳。”

“像你这样的年纪，这种状况真是少见。”

说到这里，他瞥了一眼我重叠着放在桌子上的手。我很奇怪他在找什么，不过，不久他的话就给了这个探索一个解释。

“你没有结婚？是个单身女人？”

黛安娜大笑起来。“嗨，她不会超过十七或十八岁，圣·约翰。”她说。

“我快十九了，不过没有结过婚，没有。”

一提到结婚，让我想起了残酷而恼人的回忆，脸上觉得火辣辣的。他们都把我当时的尴尬和感情看在眼里。黛安娜和玛丽为了减轻我的不自在，她们故意看别的地方，而不是盯着我绯红的脸看个不停；但那个冷血、残忍的哥哥仍然在盯着我看，直到他激起的不安逼得我不仅脸红而且流出了眼泪。

“来这之前你住在什么地方？”他又问道。

“你的问题也太多了，圣·约翰。”玛丽低声咕哝着。但他带着诱人的坚定的眼光，将身子俯过桌子，要求得到回答。

“我住在哪儿，跟谁住在一起，这是我的秘密。”我回答得很简略。

“在我看来，要是你高兴，你就有权不把它告诉圣·约翰或其他人。”黛安娜回答说。

“不过，要是我不了解你或者你的过去，我无法帮助你，”他说，“而你现在需要帮助，不是吗？”

“我需要帮助，我也一直在寻找帮助，先生。我希望真正的慈善家能帮我找到一份我可以干的工作，能有一份可以养活我自己的薪水，能满足基本的生活需要就行。”

“我不知道自己算不算一位真正的慈善家，但我会尽最大努力帮助你；那么请你首先告诉我，你以前干什么工作？你能干什么工作？”

我现在已经吃完茶点，饮料使我犹如喝了酒的巨人，精神大为振作，它给我衰弱的神经注入了新的活力，使我能够不慌不忙地跟这位目光敏锐的年轻法官说话。

“里弗斯先生，”我转向他，看着他，就像他看着我一样，坦诚而勇敢，“你和你的妹妹们帮了我一个大忙——这是一个伟大的人能为他的同类提供的最大帮助了。你们的好心把我从死亡线上救了回来。你们对我的恩情，让我感激不尽。在某种程度上，你们也有权知道我的秘密。我会在不损害我心境的平静、自身及他人道德和人身安全的前提下，尽量把你们所庇护的流浪者的身世说个明白。

“我是一个孤儿，一个牧师的女儿。在我还不记事的时候，我的父母就过世了。我靠人抚养长大，在一个慈善机构受了教育。我甚至可以告诉你这个机构的名字，我在那里做了六年学生，两年教师——某某郡洛伍德孤儿院，你可能听说过，里弗斯先生？——罗伯特·布罗克赫斯特是那里的赞助人。”

“我听说过布罗克赫斯特先生，也去过那所学校。”

“大约一年前我离开了洛伍德，当了一名私人家庭教师。我得到了一份很好的工作，生活也很愉快。来这里的四天前，我不得不离开那个地方。离开的原因我不能也不该解释，就是解释了也没有用，而且很危险，有些让人难以置信。我没有任何过错，像你们三位中的任何一位一样，是无罪的。我很难过，以后一段时间还得这样，因为我是因为一个奇怪而又可怕的原因被从我看做天堂的房子里赶出来的。在计划逃离时我认为两点很重要——速度和隐蔽。为了做到这两点，我不得不把我所有的东西统统留下，只拿了一个包裹。就是这个小包裹，我也在匆忙和烦恼中，落在把我带到惠特克劳斯的马车上了。于是我囊空如洗来到附近。我露宿了两夜，游荡了两天，没有跨进一道门槛，在这段时间只吃过两样东西。正当我由于饥饿、疲乏和绝望到了几乎只剩最后一口气时，你，里弗斯先生，不让我饿死或冻死在你家门口，把我收留进你们的房子。我知道从那时起你的妹妹们为我所做的一切——因为在我外表上麻木迟钝的那些日子里，我并不是没有感觉的——我对你们给予我的自然、真诚、亲切的怜悯，如同对你合乎福音的慈善，欠下了一笔很大的债。”

“现在别再让她谈下去了，圣·约翰。”我停下来时，黛安娜说，“显然她不宜激动，上沙发这儿来，坐下吧，爱略特小姐。”

一听这个化名，我不由自主地微微一惊，我已忘了我新起的名字。但什么都逃不过里弗斯先生的眼睛，他立刻注意到了。

“你说你的名字叫简·爱略特是吗？”他说。

“我是这么说过，这个名字，我是想作为权宜之计暂时用用的，但不是我的真名。所以当我第一次听到它时，有点陌生。”

“你不愿意告诉我们你的真名？”

“不愿。我害怕被人发现我是谁。凡是会导致这种后果的事，我都要避开。”

“我敢肯定你做得很对，”黛安娜说，“现在，哥哥，让她安静一会儿吧。”

但是，圣·约翰沉默了一会儿后，又开腔了，还是像刚才那样目光敏锐，不慌不忙：

“你不愿长期依赖我们的好客吧——我看你会希望尽快摆脱我妹妹们的怜悯，尤其是我的慈善（我对他的强调很敏感，但也不生气——因为那是正当的）。你希望独立生活，不依赖我们，对吗？”

“是的，我已经这么说过了。告诉我怎么工作，或者怎么找到工作，这就是我现在所要求的。然后放我走，即使是到最简陋的草屋去我都愿意。但在我找到工作之前，请让我待在这儿，我害怕再去品尝无家可归饥寒交迫的滋味。”

“你会留在这儿的。”黛安娜把她白皙的手放在我头上说。“你会的。”玛丽重复说，口气里透出了含蓄的真诚，这在她似乎是自然的流露。

“你瞧，我的妹妹们很乐意收留你，”圣·约翰先生说，“就像乐意收留和抚育一只被寒风驱赶到了窗前，快要冻僵的鸟一样。我更倾向于让你自己养活自己，而且要努力这样做。但是请注意，我的活动范围很窄，不过是个贫困乡村教区的牧师。我的帮助肯定是最微不足道的。要是你不屑于干日常琐事，那就去寻找比我所能提供得更有效的帮助吧。”

“她已经说过，她愿意干任何力所能及的事情。”黛安娜替我回答，“而且你知道，圣·约翰，她没有别的人可以求助，不得不忍受像你这么固执的人。”

“如果找不到更好的工作，我可以当个裁缝，可以当个普通女工，也可以当个仆人，做护理也可以。”我回答。

“行，”圣·约翰先生十分冷淡地说，“如果你有这种精神，我就答应你用合适的时间、合适的方式帮助你。”

这时他又继续看他那本茶点之前就已埋头在看的书。我立刻退了出去，因为我已经在我目前体力许可的范围内说了很多话，坐了很久了。





第三十章


对沼泽居的人多了解一分，我对他们就更喜欢一分。不到几天时间，我的身体便很快地恢复，我已经可以整天坐着，有时还能出去走走。我已能参与黛安娜和玛丽的一切活动，跟她们谈话，爱谈多久就谈多久；不论什么时候，什么地方，只要她们需要，我就去帮忙。在这些交往中，有一种令人振奋的愉悦——我还是第一次体会到——这种愉悦产生于趣味、情调和原则的融洽。

我喜欢读她们喜欢看的书，欣赏她们所欣赏的，赞同她们所赞同的。她们喜欢这个宁静的家，喜欢这个灰白、小巧、古老的建筑物。它有着低矮的屋顶、格子状的窗扉、销蚀的小径和古杉夹道的马路——山中强劲的风使这些古杉都已倾斜，我也喜欢。她们家的花园，黑乎乎的，长满了冬青树和紫杉，里面没有盛开的鲜花，唯有那茂盛的坚硬物种。她们眷恋住宅后面和周围紫色的荒原，眷恋凹陷的溪谷。一条鹅卵石筑成的马道，从大门口由高而低通向那里，先在碧树丛生的两岸之间蜿蜒着，随后又经过与欧石楠荒原交界的几片最荒芜的小牧场。一群灰色的荒原羊和苔藓般面孔的羊羔，都靠这几片牧场来维持生命——哦，她们热情满怀地眷恋着这番景色。我能理解她们的感情，与她们一样感受到这个地方的力量与真谛，我看到了这一带诱人的魅力，体会到它所奉献的孤寂。我的眼睛尽情地享受着起伏的荒原所带来的景色，享受着山脊上与山谷中由青苔、灰色欧石楠、小花点缀的草地、鲜艳夺目的欧洲蕨和颜色柔和的花岗岩所形成的荒野色彩。这些点滴景物之于我如同之于她们，都是无数清新可爱的快乐源泉。猛烈的狂风和柔和的微风、凄风苦雨的天气和平平静静的日子、日出时分和日落时刻、月光皎洁的夜晚和乌云密布的黑夜，都使我跟她们一样深为这个地方所吸引，如同对她们一样，都对我产生了一种魔力。

在室内，我们一样相处得很融洽。她们比我更有学问，读的书也更多。我在她们先前探索出来的知识道路上急切地追赶。我贪婪地读着她们借给我的书，而晚上与她们讨论我白天读过的书是一种极大的享受。想法与想法一致，观点与观点吻合，总之，大家意气相投。

如果在我们三个中要选出一位领导者的话，那人就是黛安娜。从身体条件上看，她远远优于我。她五官端正，体力强健。在她那旺盛的精神中，有着丰富的生命力，而且总是精力充沛，这使我无法理解，也激起了我的惊奇。夜晚的最初时刻，我还能谈一会儿，但一阵子轻松自如的谈话之后，我便只好坐在黛安娜脚边的矮凳上，把头靠在她膝头上，轮流听着她和玛丽深谈着我只触及了皮毛的话题。黛安娜愿意教我学德语，我喜欢跟她学。我发现教师的角色不仅让她高兴而且这个职业也很适合她，同样学生的角色也适合我，也使我高兴。我们的个性十分吻合，渐渐地彼此之间的感情越来越深厚。她们发现我会画画，因此她们的画笔和颜料盒的使用权就归我了。我在画画方面的技术要比她们好一些，这使她们非常吃惊，也让她们着迷了。我绘画时玛丽会一小时一小时地坐着看我作画，随后也学了起来，而且是位聪明、听话、用功的学生。我们就这样一起娱乐，彼此都得到了乐趣，一周的日子像一天，一天的日子像一小时似的，飞快地过去了。

至于圣·约翰先生，我与他妹妹之间形成的那种自然而迅速的亲密无间的感情，却没有延伸到他那儿。我们之间疏远的一个原因是他很少在家里待着，他的大部分时间都用在奔忙于教区分散的居民之间，走访病人和穷人。

不管下雨还是晴朗，没有任何天气能阻挡牧师巡防的步伐。当他早上学习的时间一过，他就会拿起帽子，牵着他父亲的那条猎犬——卡罗，外出去履行他应尽的使命——我不知道他是从什么角度来看待这一使命的。当天气不好的时候，他的妹妹们会劝他不要去了。那时候他就会带着一脸怪笑，更加严肃地说：

“如果一阵风或一场雨就可以这么轻易地让我放弃这份工作，那这种懒惰怎么能为我将来想干的事情做准备呢？”黛安娜和玛丽对这个问题的回答往往是一声叹息和几分钟明显伤心的沉默。

但除了经常不在家，和他交朋友的第二个障碍就是他是一个保守、心不在焉、沉思默想的人。他对自己的工作充满了热情，生活和习惯上都没有可以指责的地方，但他好像不喜欢享受每个虔诚的基督徒和脚踏实地的慈善家应得的内心的宁静和满足。晚上，他经常坐在挨着窗户的桌子旁边，桌子上摆放几张纸，不看书也不写东西，只是双手托着下巴，任凭思绪在我不熟知的领域内驰骋，从他眼睛频繁的闪烁和变幻莫测的张闭中，可以看到兴奋与激动。

除此之外，我想他不像他的妹妹那样，认为大自然是快乐的宝库。他曾经说过，我只听说过一次，他对崎岖的山丘怀着很深的感情，对自己家黑色的屋顶、灰色的墙壁有着很深的眷恋。但说这话时，他的语调和话语中充满了忧郁的味道，而绝非快乐。而且他从来没有因为要感受荒原的宁静而漫步其中，也从来没有去发现或谈及荒原给人千百种平静的乐趣。

由于他不爱交际，过了一段时间我才找到了解他的机会。我听了他在莫尔顿自己的教堂讲道后，对他的能力有了初步的了解。我希望能描绘一下他那次讲道，但我没有这个能力，我甚至无法确切表达它给我的印象。

开头很平静，其实，以讲演的风格和语调而言，应该是自始至终都很平静。一种发自肺腑而严加控制的热情，很快注进了清晰的语调，激发起生动的语言，话语变得铿锵有力起来。牧师的力量让人心灵为之颤动，思想为之诧异，却都没有被感化。他的讲演自始至终贯穿着一种奇怪的痛苦，缺少一种宽慰人的温柔。他不断严厉地提到加尔文主义——上帝的选拔、命定和天罚，每次的提醒听起来仿佛是在宣布末日的来临。布道结束以后，我的心情并没有因为受到他的启发而更加平静，而是感受到了一种莫名的哀伤。因为我似乎觉得我所倾听的雄辩，出自充满浑浊的失望的心灵深处，在那里跳动着一颗愿望无法满足和憧憬无法实现的躁动之心，不知道别人是不是有同样的感觉。我确信圣·约翰·里弗斯尽管生活单纯，为人真诚热情，但仍没有找到神圣的上帝的安宁。我想他与我一样，都没有找到。我是因为打碎了偶像，失去了天堂而产生了隐蔽而焦躁不安的悔恨——这些悔恨我虽然最近已避而不谈，但它仍无情地纠缠着我，压抑着我。

转眼间，一个月的时间过去了。黛安娜和玛丽不久就要离开沼泽居，回到各自不同的生活和角色中去了。她们要去英格兰南部一个既大又时髦的城市去当家庭教师。她们有各自不同的工作环境，都被富有家庭的成员看做卑下的附属物。那些人从来都不知道去挖掘她们内心的潜能，而只会赏识她们已经获得的技艺，这和赏识厨师的手艺、女人的情趣没有什么区别。曾经许诺给我找工作的事情，圣·约翰先生从来没有再提起过。但眼下对我来说，找一个可以谋生的职业已经是刻不容缓的事情了。一天早上，我和他在客厅里单独坐了一段时间后，我尝试着走近窗户，他的桌子、椅子等学习用的工具都在那儿。尽管我还没想好我要怎么说我要询问的事情，但我已准备开口问了。无论什么时候要打破包裹着他这种拘谨性格的外壳，都是十分困难的。他倒省了我麻烦，先开口了。

我走近时，他抬起头来，“你找我有事吗？”他说。

“是的，我想问一下你是否帮我找到适合我的工作了？”

“三个星期前，我为你找到了或设计了一份工作，但看到你在这儿过得很开心，况且我的妹妹们也都很喜欢你，你的存在给她们带来了不少快乐，我觉得打破你们之间的这种愉快是不合时宜的。我想还是等她们离开沼泽居，或你觉得有必要的时候再说吧。”

“那么她们三天之后就要离开了吗？”我说。

“是的。她们走了以后，我将会回到莫尔顿的牧师公馆，汉娜也会跟着我去。这座房子到时候就将关闭了。”

我等了一会儿，期待他能继续我刚才提出的问题，可是他好像陷入了另一段沉思，似乎忘了我和我工作的事情。我必须把他拉回我最为迫切、最为关心的话题上来。

“你为我想到了什么样的工作，里弗斯先生？希望这段时间的拖延不会增加谋职的难度。”

“呵呵，不会。因为这是一份只有我来提供、只有你来接受的工作。”

他又开始沉默，好像不大愿意继续说下去了。我有些不耐烦了——一个或两个不安的动作以及一个急切而严厉的眼神落在他脸上，为他表达了与语言一样有效的信息，但省了不少麻烦的情感。

“你没必要这么着急地知道，”他说，“坦白告诉你吧，我没有什么合适的或赚钱的工作要介绍给你。但我解释之前，我应该清楚地告诉你，如果我能帮助你的话，那肯定就像瞎子帮助瘸子一样苍白无力。当还完我父亲欠下的所有债务之后，我发现我成了一个穷人。他留给我的就是这座破旧的农庄，农庄后一排枯萎的杉树以及一片前面长着紫杉和冬青灌木的荒土。我是一个卑微的人，里弗斯是一个古老的姓氏，这个家族仅存的三个后裔中，有两个在陌生人家中靠他人为生，第三个认为自己应该远离故土，远走他乡，不仅活着这样，死了也要这样。是的，他认为这样的命运是他的光荣，他盼望有朝一日摆脱尘世束缚的十字架会放在他肩上，那位自己也是最卑微一员的教会斗士的首领会传下号令：‘起来，跟着我！’”

圣·约翰像布道一样说着这些话，语调平静而深沉，脸不发红，目光炯炯。他继续说：

“我是一个贫穷而卑贱的人，所以我也只能给你提供一个贫穷而低贱的工作。你可能会认为只是这种工作很低贱，因为从你平时的习惯看来，我能感觉到你的工作要求。你倾向于理想化，你的社交范围局限于受过教育的人。但我认为凡是对我们民族有好处的工作都不低俗。越是贫瘠和没有被开垦的土地，基督教徒越是要承担去那儿开垦的使命——他的劳动所挣得的报酬越少，他的荣誉就越高。在这种情况下，他的命运就是先驱者的命运，传播福音的第一批先驱者就是使徒们——他们的首领就是耶稣，他本人就是救世主。”

“嗯？”他再次停下时我说，“说下去。”

在他继续之前，他看了我一眼。确实，他似乎很悠闲地读着我的脸，仿佛它的五官和线条是一页书上的人物。他仔细打量后所得出的结论，一部分在他接下来的谈话中体现出来了。

“我相信你会接受我给你提供的工作，”他说，“至少会干一段时间，尽管不是永远。就像我不会永久担任英国乡村牧师这狭隘——使人越来越狭隘——平静而神秘的职位。因为你的性格跟我的一样，其中有一种不安分的东西，尽管本质不同。”

“请务必解释一下。”当他再次停下来时，我催促道。

“好的。你会听到这工作多么可怜、多么琐碎、多么束缚人。既然我的父亲已经去世了，我就是我自己的主人。我不会永远待在莫尔顿。我打算在一年内离开，但是我要竭尽全力促进它的发展。当我两年前来到莫尔顿的时候，这里没有学校，所有穷人的孩子都被进步的希望拒之门外。因此，我在这里建立了一所学校，专门为穷人家的男孩提供教育机会。现在我想再开一所女子学校。我已经租赁好了校舍，其中有一个两室的小屋是为女教师准备的。女教师的薪水是一年三十英镑。在奥利弗小姐的大力支持下，教师宿舍已经布置妥当，家具虽然少，但是足够用了。奥利弗小姐是我管辖教区最有钱的奥利弗先生唯一的女儿，奥利弗先生现在是坐落在山谷中的针厂和铸件厂的老板。奥利弗小姐还给一个从孤儿院找来的孤女支付了学费和制服费，条件是这个孤儿要帮助女教师干些家务和学校里的杂活，因为女教师忙于教学，没有时间亲自料理这些事。你愿意做这样一位教师吗？”

他有点仓促地提出这个问题。对于我的思想和感情，他猜到了一点，但是并不完全知道，他说不出我会怎样看待这种命运，他似乎有一半猜想，这个建议会遭到愤怒的，至少是轻蔑的拒绝。说实话，这工作很低俗——但它毕竟提供了一个遮风避雨的地方，我想有一个安全的避难所；这工作沉闷乏味——但比起富人家的家庭教师的职业来说，至少在人格上它是独立的。我怕到陌生人那里去当奴役，这种恐惧像铁钳一样夹住了我的心。这份工作并不丢脸，精神上也并不低下。我做出了决定。

“谢谢你的建议，里弗斯先生。我诚心诚意地接受这份工作。”

“你理解我说的是什么吗？”他说，“这是一所乡村学校，你的学生是穷人家的女儿，而且大部分是茅屋家的女儿，比较好的就是农场主的女儿。编织、缝纫、阅读、写作，都要你一个人来教。你自己的知识怎么办呢？你大部分的思想、感情、情趣又该怎么办呢？”

“先把它们保存起来，等用得着的时候再用。”

“那你知道你要从事什么样的工作了？”

“是的，我知道。”

这时他笑了，不是苦笑，也不是伤心的笑，而是十分满意并深为感激的笑。

“那你什么时候开始工作？”

“我明天就搬到分给我的房子里去，如果你愿意，下个星期就可以开学了。”

“很好，就这样吧。”

他立起身来，穿过房间，一动不动地站着再次看着我。他摇了摇头。

“有什么不妥吗，里弗斯先生？”我问。

“你不会长期待在莫尔顿的，不会，不会的。”

“为什么呢？能说一下这样说的理由吗？”

“我从你的眼睛里看到了——不是那种预示着要安度一生的表情。”

“我可没有野心。”

他听了“野心”两个字吃了一惊，便重复说：“不，你怎么会想到野心呢？谁有野心呢？我知道我自己是这样。但你怎么发现的？”

“我在说我自己。”

“嗯，要是你并不野心勃勃，那你是——”他打住了。

“是什么呢？”

“我想说激情，但又害怕你误会了我的意思，不高兴。我的意思是说，从你身上能强烈地感受到人类的爱心和同情心的影子。我相信你不会满足于在孤独中打发你的业余时间，也不希望把你的工作时间都浪费在没有激情的单调工作上。”接着他又强调地补充说，“就像我不会满足于住在这里，埋没在沼泽地里，封闭在大山之中，因为这与上帝赐予我的天性格格不入，上天所赋予的才能会被断送。这会儿你听见了我如何自相矛盾了吧。我自己讲道时说要安于自己卑贱的命运，只要为上帝效劳，即使当砍柴工和汲水人也心甘情愿。而我，上帝所任命的牧师，几乎是焦躁不安地咆哮着。哎呀，爱好与原则总得想个办法统一起来。”

他离开了房间。在短短的一小时之内，我对他的了解比我以前一个月了解的都多，但是他对我仍然是个谜。

随着离家和离开亲人的日子越来越近，黛安娜和玛丽变得越来越伤心，越来越沉默。她们都试图装出和平时一样的样子，可是她们努力与之战斗的悲伤却不是那么容易被征服和掩饰的。黛安娜说，这次离别与以往所经历的完全不同。就圣·约翰来说，那可能是一去几年，也可能是永别。

“他可以为自己决定已久的事情牺牲一切，”她说，“但天生的感情依然很强烈。简，圣·约翰看起来很平静，但他的内心深处却藏着一把火。你可以认为他很温顺，但有时候又像死亡一样无情。最糟糕的是，我根本无法说服他放弃他那个残酷的决定。当然，我绝不会因此而责备他，因为为基督献身是一件正确而又高尚的事情，但它让我的心都要碎了！”说到这儿，泪水已经充满了那双漂亮的眼睛，玛丽低着头干着手中的活儿。

“我们已没有父亲，很快就要没有家、没有哥哥了。”她喃喃地说。

这时候发生了一个小小的插曲，仿佛也是天意，要证实“祸不单行”的格言，伤心之中因眼看到手的东西又失掉而更添恼怒。圣·约翰走过窗前，读着一封信，他走进房间。

“我们的舅舅约翰去世了。”他说。

两位姐妹都似乎一怔，既不感到震惊也不表示惊讶。在她们的眼睛里这消息显得很重要，但并不令人痛苦。

“死了？”黛安娜重复说。

“是的。”

她带着搜索的目光紧盯着她哥哥的脸庞。“那又怎样呢？”她低声问。

“那又怎样，死了？”他回答，面部像大理石一样毫无表情，“那又怎样？哎呀——没有怎样。自己看吧。”

他把信扔在她的腿上，黛安娜匆匆看了一边，就把它递给了玛丽。玛丽默默地读着，读完之后，就又把信还给了圣·约翰。三个人你看看我，我看看你，都笑了起来，那是一种凄凉、忧郁的笑。

“阿门！我们毕竟活着。”黛安娜最后说。

“不管怎样，它并没有让我们的状况比以前更糟糕。”玛丽说。

“只不过它强行使人想起本来可能会出现的景象，”里弗斯先生说，“而与实际的景象形成有些过分鲜明的对照。”

他折好信，锁进抽屉，又走了出去。

几分钟内没有人开腔。黛安娜转向我。

“简，你会对我们和我们的秘密感到奇怪，”她说，“而且会认为我们心肠太狠，像舅舅这样一位近亲去世了居然不那么难过。但是我们从来没有见过他，也不认识他。他是我们母亲的兄弟，很久以前我父亲和他曾有过争吵。就是听从他的建议，父亲把大部分资产冒险投入一桩生意，就是这桩生意毁了我们的父亲。他们彼此责备对方，然后怒气冲冲地绝交了，再也没有和好。我舅舅后来又投资了几家使他财运亨通的企业。他似乎积攒了两万英镑的财产。他一直没有结婚，除了我们和另外一个人外，就没有别的近亲了。另外那个的关系比我们也近不了多少。我的父亲抱有这样的想法，希望他会把遗产留给我们，以弥补他的过失。现在他过世了，这封信通知我们，他已把所有遗产都给了他另外一位亲戚，只留下三十畿尼，由圣·约翰、黛安娜和玛丽·里弗斯三兄妹平分，用来购置三枚丧戒。当然他有权按他的意愿做，但是收到这样的消息暂时总使我们有些扫兴。玛丽和我各得一千英镑都会认为自己很富有了，而这样一笔钱对圣·约翰也是很有帮助的，因为这能让他做些好事。”

这番解释之后，这个问题就搁下了，不管是里弗斯先生还是他的妹妹们，都没有再提起。第二天，我离开沼泽居去了莫尔顿。第三天，黛安娜和玛丽辞别了她们的亲人，去了遥远的B城。一个星期之后，里弗斯先生和汉娜准备搬到牧师公馆。从此以后，这座古老的宅院就这样废置了。





第三十一章


我最终找到了一个属于我自己的家——一间小房子。它的墙壁被粉刷成白颜色，地面是沙石铺成的，还包括四把喷刷过的椅子和一张桌子，一个钟表，一个橱柜，上面摆放着几个盘子、碟子，还有一套陶瓷茶具。楼上，有一个厨房大小的房间是卧室，里面有床架和抽屉。衣柜虽小，但对我不多的衣物来说已经绰绰有余了，尽管我和蔼可亲的朋友们慷慨解囊，已经为我增添了一些必要的衣服。

傍晚时分，我给了给我当女仆的小孤女一个橘子，打发她走了。我独自坐在火炉旁。今天早上，学校开课了。我总共有二十个学生，其中只有三个学生有阅读能力，但是不会写字和算术，有几个学生会编织和懂一点缝纫技巧。学生们说话带着很浓的方言，目前我和他们的言语交流都存在着障碍。有一些学生没有礼貌、粗俗、很难管束和无知，但是其他学生很听话，有想要学点知识的渴望，是我喜欢的那种性格。我永远不能忘记这些穿着粗陋衣衫的小农民，像名门望族的后裔一样是有血有肉。在他们的心中，跟出身最好的人一样，存在着天生的美德、雅致、智慧和善良的情感。我的任务是让这些美好的种子茁壮成长，当然我在履行这个职责的时候，可能会发现一点快乐。我对目前摆在我面前的生活并没有多大的期望，但是如果我能管束一下我的心，像我应该的那样运用我的力量，毫无疑问，它会给我一些东西，让我一天天过下去。

今天上午和下午，在那间四壁空空、简陋不堪的教室里度过的几小时，使我感到快乐、安心、知足吗？为了对得起自己的良心，我不得不说“不是”。在某种程度上，我感觉很孤寂，我感觉——是的，我好像傻瓜一样——我感觉很丢人。我怀疑我所跨出的一步不是提高而是降低了自己的社会地位。我的所见所闻都是无知、贫穷和粗俗，这让我失望到了极点。但别让我因为这些情感而痛恨和蔑视自己，我知道这些情感是不对的——这是一大进步。我要努力驱除这些情感。我相信明天我将战胜它们中的一部分，几周之后或许我可以完全征服它们，几个月后，我会高兴地看到学生们大有进展，到时候满意就要大于厌恶了。

我同时也想问我自己：“更好是什么样的？”屈服于诱惑，听从激情，不作任何努力，不作任何斗争就陷入温柔乡中，在鲜花的覆盖下熟睡，等醒来的时候，发现自己在奢华的别墅当中。如果真是那样的话，我现在肯定在法国的某个地方，做了罗切斯特的情妇，有一半的时间在对他疯狂的爱恋中度过，他会，对，他会暂时地为我着迷。他爱我，没有人再这样爱我了。我永远也看不到有谁会为美丽、青春、优雅如此倾倒了，因为除了他，我不会对任何人有这么大的魅力。他喜欢我，为我感到骄傲，这是其他人对我不曾有的感情。可是我会在哪儿游荡，我会说什么，尤其是我会有什么感觉呢？我问，在马赛愚人的天堂做一个奴隶，一会儿开心得浑身发烧，一会儿羞愧和悔恨得痛哭流涕，是这样好呢，还是在健康的英国中部，一个山风吹拂的角落，做一个无忧无虑、老老实实的乡村女教师好呢？

是的，当我坚持原则和法则，嘲弄和碾碎不清醒的冲动的时候，我感觉自己是对的。上帝指引我做了一个正确的选择，我感激上帝对我的指引。

薄暮时分，我想到这里便站了起来，向门口走去。看着收获时节的落日、田野及离村庄有大约半英里远的学校。鸟儿们正唱着它们最后的一曲：





空气温和，露水芬芳。





看着眼前的一切，我想我是幸福的；但是很奇怪我发现自己已经哭泣了很长时间，为什么呢？因为命运把我从我深爱的主人身边强行拉走，因为我再也见不到他，因为他那绝望的悲痛和极度的狂怒，都是我出走所带来的。这种悲痛和狂怒也许正牵引他离正路越来越远，使他再也没有希望回到正确的方向上去了。一想到这里，我就不再去看黄昏可爱的天空和孤独的莫尔顿山谷，我很孤独，那是因为在山弯里，除了掩映在树丛中的教堂和牧师住宅，以及另一头顶端住着有钱的奥利弗先生和他女儿的溪谷庄园，再也看不见其他建筑了。我捂住眼睛，把头倚在门的石框上面。不久一阵细微的响动从我的小花园与外边草地分开的小门附近传来，于是我抬起头来。我看到了一条狗，那是里弗斯先生的卡罗，正在用鼻子推门。只见圣·约翰双手抱臂，倚在门上。他双眉紧锁，严肃得近乎不悦的目光盯着我，我请他进屋。

“不进去了，我待不了多长时间，我只是给你捎来了一个小包裹，是我的妹妹们留给你的。我想里面装了颜色盒、画笔和纸张。”

我走过去接过包裹，这是一个非常受欢迎的礼物。当我靠近的时候，我想他肯定会用严厉的眼神审视我的脸，泪水无疑会在脸上留下痕迹。

“第一天下来，是不是发现工作比想象中要难？”他问。

“没有！相反，我想我早晚会和我的学生们相处得很融洽的。”

“那或许是你的住宿条件、你的宿舍、宿舍里面的家具没有达到你的期望？说实话，确实很寒碜，但是——”

我打断了他：

“我的小屋既干净又可以避风雨，我的家具足够用了，而且用起来很方便。我看到的一切都让我心存感激，而不是失望。我绝不是一个傻瓜和享乐主义者，为缺少地毯、沙发、银盘而懊悔不已。五个星期以前，我一无所有，我是一个流浪汉、一个乞丐、一个漂泊者；现在我有了朋友，有了家，又有了养家糊口的职业。我感谢上帝的仁慈、朋友们的慷慨、命运的垂青。我并不感到烦恼。”

“但你不觉得孤独是一种压抑吗？你后面的小房子既黑又空。”

“但我几乎没有时间来享受宁静，更没有时间因为孤独而感到不耐烦。”

“不错。我希望你说的是真话。不管怎么说，你健全的理智会告诉你，像罗得的妻子那样犹豫迟疑、畏首畏尾，还为时过早。我见到你之前你遇到了什么，我无从知道，但我劝你要坚决抵制过去的诱惑。好好经营你现在的工作，至少要干几个月。”

“这正是我想做的。”我回答。

圣·约翰继续说：

“要控制工作的意愿和改变天性不是一件容易的事情；但也不是不能改变的，从我的经验来说，可以。在一定程度上，上帝给予我们掌握自己命运的权利；当我们渴望得到食物的时候，当我们的意志不得不顺着一条我们不愿意走的路走的时候，我们根本没有必要为食物不足而挨饿，也没有必要绝望地站在那里。我们应该换一换思维，为心灵寻找另一种养料，它像渴望品尝的禁果那样滋养人，也许还更清醇。要为敢于冒险的双脚开辟出一条路来，虽然更加坎坷，却与命运曾堵塞我们的路一样直、一样宽。

“一年之前，我也极其痛苦，觉得当牧师是一个大错误。它千篇一律的职责乏味得要命。我向往世间更活跃的生活，向往文学事业那更激动人心的劳作，向往艺术家、作家、演说家的命运，向往除了牧师之外的任何一种职业。是的，想成为政治家、士兵、光荣事业的献身者、沽名钓誉者、权力欲很强的人的一颗心，在牧师的法衣下跳动。我认为我的生活是悲惨的，必须加以改变，否则我会死去。经过一段时期的痛苦和斗争后，光明来临了，我得到了解脱。我受到约束的现状一下子豁然开朗起来，一下子扩展到了望不到边际的平原。我听到了来自上帝的召唤，于是我积聚全力，张开双翅，向未知攀登。上帝交代给我一个差事，让我把它传播到远方，很好地完成。最好的士兵、政客、演说家必需的技巧、力量、勇气和雄辩，都在一名优秀的传教士身上体现了出来。

“因此我决定成为一名传教士。从那时起，我的想法就变了，脚上的镣铐解除了，全身上下的官能得以解脱。剩下的不是束缚，而是擦伤的痛苦，那只有时间才可以治愈。其实我父亲不赞成我的决定，但现在他已经过世了，我就没有了任何合法的羁绊；其他的事情也解决了，接任我的莫尔顿牧师的人选已经定好了；感情纠葛已经冲破或者割断，这是我与人类的弱点最后的冲突，我知道我会克服它，我发誓我一定要克服它，因为我要离开欧洲，到东方去。”

他说这话的时候，口气里充满了奇怪、克制和着重强调。当他停止说话的时候，他不是在看我，而是在看落日，我也看着落日。他和我都背朝着从田野通向屋门的小径。在杂草丛生的小径上，我们没有听到脚步声，此时此刻此情此景中，唯一让人陶醉的声音是潺潺的溪流声。因此当一个银铃般的欢快甜蜜的嗓音叫起来时，我们很吃了一惊：

“晚上好，里弗斯先生，晚上好，老卡罗。你的狗比你先认出它的朋友，先生。当我还在田野那端的时候，它就看到了我，竖起它的耳朵，摇着尾巴，而你到现在还背对着我。”

确实是这样。尽管里弗斯先生猛地听到那种音乐般的声调的时候不免吃了一惊，就好像雷电从他脑袋上劈开一朵云彩一样。等说话人说完，他仍然保持着说话人惊吓了他时的表情和姿势，他的胳膊倚在门上，面朝西方。最后他转过身来，带着几分慎重。在我看来，他旁边出现了一个尤物。离他三尺的地方，有一个穿着纯白衣服的身影——年轻而优美的形体，丰满的线条，很美。这人弯下腰去抚摸卡罗时，抬起了头，把长长的面纱扔到后头，于是一张花一般的面孔，映入了眼帘。美妙绝伦是说重了一点，但我不愿收回这个词，或者另加修饰。英格兰温和的气候所能塑造的最可爱的面容，英格兰湿润的风和雾蒙蒙的天空所能催生、庇护的最纯正的玫瑰色和百合色，这种描绘在眼前的实例中证明是恰到好处的。不缺一丝妩媚，不见任何缺陷。这位年轻姑娘面部匀称娇嫩，眼睛的形状和颜色与我们在可爱的图画上看到的无异，又大又黑又亮，眼睫毛又长又浓，以一种柔和的魅力围着一双美丽的眼睛。画过的眉毛异常清晰。白皙光滑的额头给色泽与光彩所形成的活泼美增添了一种宁静。脸颊呈椭圆形，鲜嫩而滑润。嘴唇也一样鲜嫩，红彤彤十分健康，外形非常可爱。整齐而闪光的牙齿，微凹的下巴，没有缺点，浓密头发成了一个很好的装饰。总之，合在一起构成理想美的一切优点都是属于她的，我瞧着这位漂亮的女士，不胜惊讶，对她一心赞叹。大自然显然出于偏爱创造了她，忘记给予她通常吝啬的后母会给的小礼，而授予了她外祖母会给的慷慨恩赐。

圣·约翰·里弗斯看到这位人间的天使会有什么反应呢？当我看到圣·约翰转过身，看到这位美女的时候，很自然地就产生了这样的疑问。不过我也很自然地从他的脸上得到了答案。他的目光已经从这位美女身上移开，转而注视便门旁不起眼的雏菊。

“多美好的夜晚，不过太晚了，你不该独自出门。”他一面说，一面用脚踩踏着闭合起来的雪白的花头。

“哦，我下午刚从S市回来（她提了一下大约二十英里远的一个城市）。爸爸告诉我你的学校开学了，并且新的女老师已经到岗，所以我喝完茶后就戴上帽子跑到山谷这边来看看她。这就是那位新老师吗？”她指着我问道。

“是的。”圣·约翰说。

“你会喜欢上莫尔顿吗？”她问我，语调和举止里带着一种直率而幼稚的单纯，虽然有些孩子气，但讨人喜欢。

“我希望我会喜欢上这里。我这样做有很多原因。”

“学生有你想象中的那么专心吗？”

“十分专心。”

“你喜欢你的宿舍吗？”

“很喜欢。”

“我布置得好吗？”

“真的很好。”

“那么我选择爱丽丝·伍德给你帮忙，觉得还不错吧？”

“确实这样。她很听话也很乖巧。”那么我想这位就是继承人奥利弗小姐了。她似乎既在家产上又在容貌上得到了偏爱！我不知道她的出生碰上了什么行星的幸运组合呢？

“以后我会偶尔过来帮你上课，”她补充说，“经常来看看你，我也可以换换环境，而我喜欢有变化的生活。里弗斯先生，我待在S市的时候非常愉快。昨天晚上，或者说今天早晨，我跳舞一直跳到两点。第X团——自从骚乱以后，那个团一直驻扎在那里，而军官们是世上最讨人喜欢的人，他们使我们所有年青的磨刀匠和制剪商相形见绌。”

我好像觉得圣·约翰的下嘴唇往外伸了伸，上嘴唇抿了一会儿。当这位女孩子笑着给他这个信息的时候，他的嘴紧闭着，脸的下半部分异常严肃和古板。他不再注视那些雏菊，而把目光转到了她的身上。多么严肃、深刻而又意味深长的注视啊！她再次笑着跟他说话，笑声很适合她的年轻、她那玫瑰色的面容、她的微凹的下巴、她那晶莹的眸子。

圣·约翰一言不发，依然严肃地站着，而她又开始抚摸卡罗。“可怜的卡罗很喜欢我，”她说，“它不会严肃而疏远地对待它的朋友，如果它会说话，它不会用沉默来对待朋友的。”

当她以天生的优雅在卡罗年轻而又严肃的主人面前拍它的头的时候，我看见它主人的脸红了。我注意到他的眼睛被突然的一把火融化，闪烁着不可抗拒的感情，他的脸被烧得通红，这时候的他看起来真的很英俊，如同她是一位漂亮的女人那样。他的胸部一度起伏着，仿佛那颗巨大的心对专横的约束感到厌倦，已经违背意志扩展起来，强劲有力地跳动了一下，希望获得自由。但他把它控制住了，我想就像一位坚定的骑手勒住了跃起的马一样。对她的这种亲昵的靠近，他既没有说一句话，也没有做一个动作。

“听爸爸说，你最近都不来我们家了。”奥利弗小姐抬起头来继续说，“你简直成了溪谷庄园的陌生人了。今天晚上他只有一个人，而且不大舒服。你愿意和我一起回去看望他吗？”

“现在这个时候去打扰奥利弗先生不合适吧。”圣·约翰回答。

“不合适！我觉得这个时间正好合适。这个时间是爸爸最需要人做伴的时候，因为现在所有的工厂都关门了，他没有别的事情可以做。里弗斯先生，一定要去。为什么你这么羞赧，这么严肃呢？”她自己做了回答，填补了他的沉默所留下的空隙，“我怎么忘了！”她摇着她那漂亮的鬈发嚷道，仿佛对自己感到吃惊似的，“我真是又晕又没有脑子！请原谅我。我想你没有正当的理由拒绝和我们聊天。黛安娜和玛丽已经走了，沼泽居也已经关门了，真可怜，现在就剩下你一个人。到我们家去看看我爸爸吧。”

“今晚不去了，罗莎蒙德小姐，改日吧。”

圣·约翰先生机械地说着那些话。只有他自己知道要拒绝对方所要付出的力气。

“好吧，既然你那么固执，我要走了，可不敢再这么待下去，露水已经开始降了，晚安！”

她伸出手来。他只碰了一碰。“晚安！”他重复道，音调低沉，而且像回音那么沉闷。她转过身去，但过了一会儿又回过身来。

“你没生病吧？”她问。她难怪会提出这个问题来，因为他的脸色像她的衣服一样苍白。

“我很好。”他宣称，随后点了点头离开了大门。她走一条路，他走的是另一条路。她像仙女一样轻快地走下田野时，两次回头盯着他，而他坚定地大步走过，连头都没有回。

看到别人受苦和做出牺牲的情景，使我从对自己的受苦和牺牲的沉思中挣脱出来。黛安娜·里弗斯曾说她的哥哥“像死神一样无情”，她并没有夸张。





第三十二章


我继续尽可能积极而又全心全意地为这个乡村学校的发展工作着。起初这确实是件苦差事。在过去的那些日子里，通过我的努力，我可以了解我所有的学生及她们的性情。她们没有受过教育，官能都很迟钝，我当时觉得简直是无药可救了。乍一看，个个都是呆头呆脑的，但不久我便发现自己错了。她们之间是有差异的，就像受过教育的学生之间存在差异一样。我了解她们、她们也了解我之后，这种区别很快便不知不觉地扩大了。一旦她们对我的语言、习惯和生活方式逐渐适应以后，我发现一些神情呆滞、目光迟钝的乡下丫头，蜕变成了鬼灵精怪的小姑娘。有些学生亲切可爱。我发现她们中不少人天性就懂礼貌，自尊自爱，很有能力，赢得了我的好感和敬佩。这些学生很快就乐于把功课做好，保持个人卫生，经常学习并且养成了安静和遵守纪律的习惯。这种进步之大在某些方面是惊人的，我从中感到一种欣慰和真正的骄傲。另外，就我个人来讲，我喜欢上了其中几个比较出色的女孩子，同样她们也很喜欢我。在我的学生中间，有几个农民的孩子差不多已经是少女了。她们已经可以读书、写字和缝纫，对于她们，我就教给她们一些文法、地理、历史及比较细腻的针线活。我还在她们中间发现了几位难得的人，这些人对知识充满渴望，希望上进，我和她们一起度过了许多愉快的夜晚。而她们的父母（农夫和农妇）对我很殷勤。我非常高兴地接受他们纯朴的示好，作为回报，我也尊重他们的情感。对此他们不一定会随时都感到习惯，但这既让他们崇拜，也对他们有好处，因为他们眼看自己提高了地位，并渴望无愧于所受到的厚待。

我感觉我成了这个地区最受欢迎的人。每次出去，我都能听到来自四面八方的诚挚问候和看到友好的微笑。生活在普通人的关心之中，即便是劳动者的关心，也犹如阳光般的安静和甜蜜。发自内心的那种宁静恬淡的感情在阳光的普照下开始发芽、开花。在人生的这个时期，我并没有被自暴自弃淹没，相反，我却更加感恩生活。然而，读者，我把一切都告诉你们吧。在平静而充实的生活中，白天为学生做出了高尚的努力后，晚上便能充满成就感地作画、看书。但进入梦乡后，却总是做各种各样的梦，有烦躁不安的、有理想的、有激动人心的、也有急风骤雨式的，这些梦千奇百怪，充满着冒险、焦急及浪漫的气氛。在令人激动的关键时刻，我依旧会一次又一次地梦见罗切斯特先生：感受他的拥抱，倾听他的声音，迎合他的眼神，抚摸他的双手和双颊，爱他而又被他爱，希望能陪在他身边度过一生。这种感觉带着它们最初的火热复生了。随后，我醒了过来，想起了自己身在何处，是怎样的处境。接着我颤巍巍的从没有帐幔的床上爬起来。深夜目睹了我绝望的痉挛，听见了我激情的爆发。第二天早上九点，我又得按时上课，平心静气准备一天的常规工作。

罗莎蒙德·奥利弗小姐没有食言，会偶尔来看我。她通常都是在早上出来遛马的时候顺便到学校来看看。她一般骑着马到门口，后面跟着一个骑着马穿着制服的随从。她穿了一套粉红色的骑装，戴一顶亚马逊式黑丝绒帽，很有风度地戴在从脸颊一直披到肩的鬈发上，很难想象世上还有比她的外貌更标致的人了。她会这样走进那所简陋的教室，穿过被弄得眼花缭乱的乡村孩子的队伍。她总是在里弗斯先生上教义回答课时来。恐怕女访客的眼睛早已经热情地穿透了年轻牧师的心脏，当她进来的时候，一种本能提醒他，她进来了，尽管他没有亲眼看到。如果看到她出现了，他的脸颊会像发烧一样，他大理石般的脸庞，虽然努力绷紧不松，却早已难以形容地变了形。恬静中流露出一种受压抑的热情，要比肌肉的活动和目光的顾盼所显现的强烈得多。

她对自己的魅力是很自信的。确实，他没有向她隐瞒，也不可能隐瞒。尽管基督教禁欲主义的约束，当她走近他，和他说话，冲他开心、温柔甚至鼓励地微笑的时候，他的手开始颤抖，眼睛里充满了光芒。他似乎不是用嘴巴，而是用悲伤而坚毅的表情在说：“我爱你，我知道你也喜欢我。我不是因为感觉成功的希望渺茫而保持缄默。要是我勇敢地把我的心献出来，我相信你会接受它；但是这颗心早已经摆放在圣坛上，四周的火把都已准备好，它不久就只是一个焚烧的供品罢了。”

随后她就撅起了嘴，像个孩子一样，一片犹豫的云朵遮盖了她光芒四射的活力。她立即把手从他那里抽回来，任性了一会儿，就把眼神从这位既像英雄又像殉道者的脸上移开。当她离他而去的时候，圣·约翰很显然想不顾一切地追出去，挽留住她。但他的理智告诉他，他不能放弃进入天国的机会，也不能为了她的爱而失去进入真正的天国的希望。此外，他无法把他个性中的一切——流浪汉、追求者、诗人和牧师——集中于一种情感的局限之内。他不会为了溪谷山庄的客厅和宁静，放弃自己的战场。尽管他守口如瓶，但我有一次还是大胆地闯进他内心的密室，从他本人那儿了解到了如许秘密。

奥利弗小姐已经多次光临我的小屋。我对她的性格有了比较充分的了解，她并不神秘，也不虚伪；她风情万种又很热情，挑剔但不卑鄙自私，生活富足却不娇生惯养；她性子急，但很幽默；爱慕虚荣（她也是不得已，随便在玻璃里一瞥都能看见她的可爱），但并不装腔作势；她出手大方却并不因为有钱而自以为是；她头脑机灵，相当聪明，快乐活泼而没有城府。总之，她很让你着迷，即使像我这样冷眼旁观的同性也不例外；但她却又不能引起人们更大的兴趣和更深的印象。她的思想和里弗斯姐妹的完全不同，我对她的感情就像对我的学生阿德拉一样；略有不同的是，对我们看护和教育的孩子的感情要比同样具有这种魅力的成年人的感情更亲近一些。

她突然对我友好起来。她说我和里弗斯先生很像，不过她说，虽然我是一个干净利索的小人儿，但却不及他十分之一的英俊，他是一个天使。她还说我像他一样善良、聪明、镇定、坚强。她断言，作为一个乡村女教师，我天生是个怪人；她还相信我以前的故事肯定是一段有意思的奇事，如果我能告诉她的话。

一天晚上，她像孩子一样好动，轻率而并不叫人生气的好奇，把我小厨房里的碗柜和桌子里的抽屉翻腾了一遍。先是找到了两本文法书、一卷席勒的作品、一本德文语法和词典，随后又看到了我的绘画工具和几张速写，其中包括用铅笔画的我的一个学生，一个天使般的小姑娘和几张取自莫尔顿溪谷及周围荒原的不同自然景色的风景画。她先是惊讶得发呆，随后是高兴得激动不已。

“这是你画的吗？你懂法语和德语吗？你真可爱——真是个奇迹！你比S城第一流学校的教师画得还好。你愿意为我画一张速写，让我爸爸看看吗？”

“当然可以。”我回答。一想到有这样一个如此完美和充满活力的尤物做模特，画家的灵感被激发起来了。她当时穿了一件深蓝色的丝绸衣服，胳膊和脖子裸露在外面，唯一的装饰是她栗色的鬈发，波浪似的从肩上披下来。我拿了一张精致的卡纸，仔细地勾画着轮廓，并准备享受将上彩的乐趣。不过当时天色已晚，我只得告诉她改天再来给我当模特。

回到家后，她把我的情况一五一十地告诉了她的父亲。她的父亲很好奇，第二天晚上，就陪着她一起到我的住处来了。这是一个高个子、浓眉大眼、灰白头发的中年人。他的女儿站在他身旁，就好像一朵娇艳的鲜花长在灰白的大楼旁边似的。奥利弗先生不善言谈，也许是性格中的骄傲因素在作祟吧，但是他对我很和善。他很喜欢我给罗莎蒙德作的肖像速写，希望我务必把它完成，他还盛情地邀请我明天晚上去他家做客。

那天晚上我去了溪谷山庄。好大、好漂亮的住宅，到处都彰显着其所有者雄厚的实力。在溪谷庄的整个晚上，罗莎蒙德一直都是那么高兴和快乐。她的父亲和蔼可亲，喝过茶之后我们开始交谈。他对我在莫尔顿学校里的工作表示了极大的赞扬，但是通过他本人的所见所闻，只是担心我在这个小地方有些屈才，也许会很快辞职去找一份更合适的工作。

“很有可能！”罗莎蒙德嚷道，“她那么聪明，足够做一个名门的家庭女教师，爸爸。”

我想，我宁可在这儿，也绝不愿到世界上任何一个高贵的人家里去。随后奥利弗先生谈到了里弗斯先生以及里弗斯家族。提到他们的时候，奥利弗先生神情中充满了敬意。他说，里弗斯在这个地区是个古老的姓氏，那座老房子里的祖先都很富有，以前整个莫尔顿地区都属于他们。甚至现在，他认为，这家的代表要是乐意，满可以与最好的家庭联姻。他认为这么优秀、这么有才华的年轻人竟然决定要计划着去传教难免有些可惜，这就等于放弃有价值的生活。由此看来，奥利弗先生不会在罗莎蒙德和里弗斯先生的联姻上设置任何障碍，奥利弗先生明显地认为青年牧师的良好出身、古老的姓氏和神圣的职业是对他缺乏家财的足够补偿。

那天是十一月五日，一个假日。我的小助手在帮我打扫完房间以后拿着我给的一便士酬劳满意地离开了。我周围一尘不染，擦洗过的地板、磨得锃亮的炉栅栏和擦得干干净净的椅子闪闪发亮。我把自己也打扮得干净利落，随意打发着整个下午的时间。

头一个小时里，我翻译了几页德文；然后我拿起画板和画笔，开始了更为容易也更加惬意的工作，完成罗莎蒙德·奥利弗的肖像。头部已经画好，剩下的只是给背景着色，给服饰画上阴影，再在成熟的嘴唇上添一抹胭脂红——头发那儿再画上一点柔软的鬈发——把天蓝色眼盖下的睫毛的阴影加深一些。我正全神贯注地画着这些有趣的细节，一阵急促的敲门声响了起来，门打开了，圣·约翰·里弗斯先生走了进来。

“我来看看你怎么过假日的，”他说，“我希望没在想什么吧。没有，那很好，你一画画就不感到寂寞了。你看，我到现在还是不相信你，尽管你都挺到现在了。我给你带来一本书，可以帮你打发晚上的时间。”说着他把一本新出版的书放在桌上，那是一本诗集：现代文学的黄金时代，幸运的读者常常有机会欣赏一本货真价实的出版物。哎呀！我们这个时代的读者却没有那份福气。不过打起精神来！我不会停下来控诉或者发牢骚。我知道诗歌并没有死亡，天才也并没有销声匿迹，财欲也没有把两者征服，将他们捆绑起来或者杀掉，总有一天，两者都会表明自己的存在，展示自己的风采、自由和力量。强大的天使，稳坐天堂吧！当肮脏的灵魂获得胜利，弱者为自己的毁灭恸哭时，他们微笑着。诗歌被毁灭了吗？天才遭到驱逐了吗？没有！平凡的人们，不，别让忌妒激起你这种想法。不，他们不仅活着，而且在统治着，拯救着。没有他们无处不在的神圣影响，你会进地狱——你自己的卑微所造成的地狱。

当我急不可耐地浏览着《玛米昂》辉煌的篇章（因为《玛米昂》确实如此）的时候，圣·约翰走到我的画板前看起我的作品来。他蓦地惊跳起来，身体又直了起来。他什么也没有说。我抬头看了看他，他逃离了我的眼神的注视。我清清楚楚地知道他的想法，也明明白白知道他的心思。此刻我占了上风，要比他冷静得多；如果可能，我倒想帮他一把。

“他那么坚定不移和一味自我控制，”我想，“对自己实在太苛刻了。他把每种情感和痛苦都锁在内心——什么也不表白，不流露，不倾诉。我深信，和他谈一些关于那位他认为不可能结婚的对象——可爱的罗莎蒙德的事情对他有好处，我要让他开口说话。”

我首先打破僵局说：“找把椅子坐下吧，里弗斯先生。”但是他像往常一样说他一会儿就走。“那好吧，”我回答，“如果你愿意站着就站一会儿吧。但你现在还不能走，我已经下了决心。寂寞对你和对我至少是一样不好。我倒要试试，看我能不能发现你内心的秘密，在你大理石般的胸膛找到一个孔，从那里我可以滴进一滴同情的止痛剂。”

“我画得像不像？”我突然问道。

“像！像谁呀？我没仔细看。”

“你看呢，里弗斯先生。”

他被我突如其来和陌生的唐突吓着了，他惊讶地看着我。“呵，那还算不了什么，”我心里说着，“你生硬的态度吓不倒我，我可要努力地试一试。”我继续想道。

“你看得很仔细很清楚，但我不反对你再看一遍。”我站起来把画放在他手里。

“一张画得很好的画，”他说，“色彩柔和清晰，是一张很优美、很恰当的画。”

“是啊，是啊，这我都知道。不过像不像呢？像谁呢？”

他控制住了犹豫的情绪，回答：“奥利弗小姐，我猜。”

“是的。那么现在呢，为了奖励你回答正确，我答应你以这幅画为摹本，再创作一幅精细准确的复制品送给你，不过你得同意接受这件礼物。我不想把时间和精力花在一件你认为毫无价值的东西上。”

他继续注视着这张画。注视的时间越久，他就把画抓得越牢，就越想得到它。“很像！”他喃喃地说，“眼睛画得很好。颜色、光线、表情都很完美。她在微笑！”

“保存一张复制品对你来说是一种慰藉呢，还是会伤你的心？请你告诉我。当你在马达加斯加，或者好望角，或者印度，在你的行囊中有这样的纪念品，对你是一种安慰呢，还是一看见就激起你令人丧气和难受的回忆？”

这时他偷偷地抬起眼来。他忐忑不安地看了我一眼，再次细看起这幅画来。

“画我肯定是要的，但这样做是否明智，那就是另外一回事了。”

既然我已弄明白罗莎蒙德小姐真的喜欢他，她的父亲也不大可能反对这门亲事，我——我对自己的观点可不像圣·约翰那样崇高——我心里完全赞成他们的联姻。我觉得，要是他能获得奥利弗先生的大宗财产，他可以用这笔钱做很多事情，总比在热带的太阳下让才能枯竭、让力气白费强。想着可以这么劝说他，我立刻回答：

“依我看来，你要是能立刻把画中的本人拿走，那是更明智和更有见识的。”

这时他坐了下来，把手中的画放在了他前面的桌子上，双手托着额头，深情地反复地看着这幅画。我发觉他对我的大胆不发火也不感到震惊。我甚至还看到，那么坦率地谈论一个他认为不可接触的话题——听这个话题被任意谈论——他开始感到这是一种新的乐趣——一种出乎意外的宽慰。沉默寡言的人常常要比性格爽朗的人更需要直率地讨论他们的感情和不幸，看似最严酷的禁欲主义者毕竟也是人。大胆和好心“闯入”他们灵魂的“沉寂大海”，常常是给予他们的最好的恩惠。

“她喜欢你，我敢肯定，”我站在他椅子背后说，“她的父亲也很尊重你。此外，她是个可爱的姑娘，但是不大爱思考，但有你为你和她思考就足够了，你应当娶她。”

“她喜欢我？”他问。

“当然，胜过爱其他人。她经常谈起你，没有任何一个话题让她如此喜爱或谈论这么久。”

“听你这么说我很高兴，”他说，“真的，再谈一刻钟吧。”他真的取出手表，放在桌上计算时间。

“可是，继续谈有什么用？”我问，“你也许正在准备反抗的铁拳，或者锻造新的链条把自己的心束缚起来。”

“别想这些无情的东西了。想象一下我让步了，被感化了，就像我正在做的那样。俗人的爱就好比是我心中新开辟的喷泉，不断喷涌，甜蜜的泉水四溢，流淌到了我仔细而辛劳地开垦出来的田野里——这里辛勤地播种着善意和自我克制的种子。现在这里泛滥的甜美的洪水已经淹没了稚嫩的萌芽，现在可口的毒药正腐蚀着它们。此刻我看到自己躺在溪谷庄的睡榻上，躺在我的新娘——罗莎蒙德·奥利弗的脚跟前。她用那甜甜的嗓音和我说话，用被你灵巧的手画得那么传神的眼睛看着我，她那珊瑚色的嘴唇朝我微笑着，那个时候，她是我的，我是她的，眼前的生活和过眼烟云般的世界对我已经足够了。嘘！别张嘴！我欣喜万分，我神魂颠倒，让我平静地度过我所规定的时间。”

我默许了他。手表滴答响着，他的呼吸时而急促，时而缓慢，我默默地站着。一刻钟过去了。他放下画像，拿起表，走到了壁炉边。

“好了，”他说，“在那一小段时间中我已沉溺于痴心妄想了。我把脑袋靠在诱惑的胸口，心甘情愿地把脖子伸向她花一般的枷锁。我尝了她的美酒，枕头还燃着火，花环里有一条毒蛇，酒有苦味，她的允诺是空的，建议是假的。这一切我都明白。”

我惊诧不已地瞪着他。

“真是奇怪，”他说下去，“我那么狂热地爱着罗莎蒙德·奥利弗，怀着初恋的全部热情，而恋上的对象绝对漂亮、优雅、迷人；与此同时我又有一种宁静而不偏不倚的感悟，觉得她不会当个好妻子，不是适合我的伴侣，婚后一年之内我便会发现：十二个月销魂似的日子之后，接踵而来的是终身遗憾。这我知道。”

“奇怪，真奇怪！”我禁不住叫了起来。

“我内心的某一方面深深地被她的魅力折服，”他说下去，“但另一方面对她的缺陷也心知肚明。那就是她无法与我对我所追求的事业产生共鸣，不会成为我事业上的伴侣。罗莎蒙德是一个吃得起苦的劳作者、一个女使徒吗？罗莎蒙德愿意做一个传教士的妻子吗？不！”

“不过你不必当传教士，你可以放弃那个打算。”

“放弃！什么！放弃天职？我伟大的工作？我为天堂里的大厦在世间所打的基础？我要成为那一小群人的希望！这群人把自己的一切雄心壮志同那桩光荣的事业合而为一，那就是提高他们的种族，把知识传播到无知的领域，用和平代替战争，用自由代替束缚，用宗教代替迷信，用上天堂的愿望代替入地狱的恐惧。难道连这个也要一起放弃吗？它们比我的血还要珍贵，是我活着的目的，我生活的向往。”

他沉默了好长一会儿后，我说：“那么奥利弗小姐呢，难道她的失望和哀伤就和你一点关系都没有吗？”

“奥利弗小姐从来不乏求婚者和讨好献媚的人。不到一个月，我的影子就会在她的心里消失。她将会忘记我，极有可能会找一个比我更能给她带来幸福的人结婚。”

“你说得够冷酷的，但是你的内心也在忍受着矛盾的煎熬，你瘦了。”

“不是的。要是我果真瘦了，也是我为不知道未来的前景担忧的缘故——我的离别日期一拖再拖。就在今天早上，我接到消息说接替我的人——我盼了很久的人——还没有准备好在三个月之内接替我，也许三个月要拖延到六个月了。”

“无论什么时候，奥利弗小姐一走进教室你就颤抖，脸涨得通红。”

他脸上再次浮起惊讶的表情，没想到一个女人居然敢这样跟一个男人说话，可我早已习惯这种说话方式。与有思想、言语谨慎、有教养的人交往，不管是男人还是女人，我非要绕过缄默的传统，踏进奥秘的门槛，在心坎的火炉边上找到一个位置才肯罢休。

“你确实见解独到，”他说，“不过胆子也不小。你的精神中有一种勇气，正如你的眼睛有一种穿透力一样。可是请允许我向你保证，你误解了我的部分情感，你把这些情感想象得比实际的要深沉，要强烈。你给我的同情超过了我应得的范围。我在奥利弗小姐面前脸红、颤抖时，我不是怜悯自己，而是蔑视我的弱点。我知道这并不光彩，它不过是肉体的狂热，我宣布，不是灵魂的抽搐。那灵魂坚如磐石，牢牢扎在骚动不安的大海深处。你知道我是怎么样的人，一个冷酷无情的人。”

我怀疑地笑了笑。

“你出其不意，掏出了我的心里话，”他继续说，“我现在就听任你摆布了。除去用基督教义来掩盖人性缺陷，去除了血污的袍子，我就是一个冷血但野心勃勃的人。在所有的感情中，只有天然的爱对我有永久的力量，理智而不是感情，是我的向导。我的雄心没有边际，要比别人爬得高的欲望永无止境。我崇尚忍耐、坚持、勤勉和才能，因为这是干大事、出人头地的必要条件。我饶有兴趣地观察了你的经历，我认为你是勤勤恳恳、有条有理、富有活力的女人，倒并不是因为我对你经历过的或正在经受的苦难深表同情。”

“你会把自己完全描述成一位异教徒哲学家的。”我说。

“不，我与自然神论的哲学家是有区别的；我有信仰，我信奉福音。你的限定语用得不恰当，我不是异教徒哲学家，而是基督教哲学家——一个耶稣教派的信徒。作为他的信徒，我信奉纯洁、宽厚、仁慈的教义。我主张这样的教义，发誓要传播它们，我年轻时就信仰宗教，于是宗教培养了我最初的品格，它好比长在我心里的幼芽，自然地成长，长成浓荫蔽日的大树，变成了慈善主义，从人类真诚品质的粗糙野生的根上，相应长出了神圣的公正感。把我谋求私欲和好名声的雄心，变成扩大主的天地、为十字架旗帜获得胜利的大志。宗教已为我做了很多，使原始材料得到最好的利用，修剪和训练了我的天性。但是她不能消灭天性，天性不会消失，直到‘世间人变成不朽的时候’。”

说完，他拿起放在画板旁边的帽子，再一次看了看画像。

“她的确很讨人喜欢，”他喃喃地说，“她不愧为世界的玫瑰，名字起得真好。”

“那我还用再给你画一张同样的画吗？”

“有什么必要[1]？不必了。”

他拉过一张薄薄的纸盖在画上，这张纸是我平常作画时怕弄脏纸板常作为垫手用的。他究竟突然在这张空白纸上看到了什么，我无法判断。但某种东西引起了他的注意。他猛地拣起来，看了看纸边，随后瞟了我一眼，那目光奇怪得难以形容，而且不可理解，似乎摄取并记下了我的体态、面容和服饰的每个细节。他一扫而过，犹如闪电般迅速和锐利。他张开嘴唇，似乎想说话，但把到了嘴边的话咽了下去。

“怎么回事？”我问。

“没什么事，”对方回答，一面又把纸放下。我见他利索地从边上撕下一小条，放进了手套，匆匆忙忙点了点头。“下午好。”就消失得无影无踪了。

“嗨！”我用那个地区的一个短语嚷道，“真是莫名其妙！”

我也仔细看了看那张纸，但除了我试画笔色泽所留下的几滴暗淡的污渍，我什么也没有看到。对于这个谜我琢磨了一两分钟，但无法解开。我相信这也无关紧要，便不再去想它，不久也就忘了。

第三十三章


自从圣·约翰先生走后，天就开始下起雪来。飞旋的大雪纷纷扬扬地下了一整夜。第二天，凛冽的寒风又带来了几阵新的迷茫大雪。到了黄昏时分，山谷里堆满了积雪，几乎不能通行了。我关上了窗子，在门口放上了一个垫子，为了防止雪花从门下面刮进来，调整了一下火炉。之后我就在炉子旁边倾听暴风雪低沉的怒吼。大约过了一个小时，我点上了蜡烛，取来那本《玛米昂》，开始读了起来——





残阳照耀着诺汉那城堡峭立的陡壁，

美丽而又安静的特威德河宽广而又深邃，

契维奥特山孑然独立；

气势雄伟的塔楼和城堡的主垒，

两侧那绵延不绝的围墙，

都在落日余晖中闪动着金光。





在《玛米昂》的绝美韵律中，我忘记了外面的暴风雪。

突然，一个声响把我从诗中拉回到现实生活中来，我想肯定是风吹门的响声。不，那是圣·约翰先生。只见他拉起门闩，从寒冷的暴风、完全的黑暗中走出来，站在我的面前。披在他高大的身躯上的斗篷已经变成了白色，像冰川一般。我几乎吓坏了，我没想到那天夜里还会有客人到这个冰封的山谷里来。

“有什么坏消息吧？”我问，“出什么事了吗？”

“没有，你怎么那么容易受惊啊！”他回答，一边摘下斗篷，一面把它挂在门后面。他冷冷地推了推进来时被他弄歪了的垫子，跺了跺脚，把靴子上的雪抖掉。

“我会弄脏你的地面，”他说，“但这次你一定要原谅我。”说完他就向火炉走去。“我告诉你啊，我可是费了好大劲才到这儿的，”他边说便把手放在火炉上面取暖，“有一堆雪都到了我腰部，不过幸好很柔软。”

“可是你为什么在这种天气过来呢？”我忍不住问。

“问客人这样的问题，有点不太礼貌吧。但是既然你问了，我就简单地回答你，我只是想和你聊聊天。我已经厌倦了那些不会说话的书本和空荡荡的房间。另外，自从昨天以来，我一直感到一种激动，就像一个人听了故事的一半，急于想知道后一半一样。”

他坐了下来。我回想起他昨天奇怪的举动，真的开始担心他的脑子出了问题。如果他真的神志模糊了，也是一种冷酷而又镇定的不清醒。当他把被雪打湿的头发撩到一边，炉火照射着他苍白的眉毛和脸颊的时候——我从来没见过他这样英俊的面容，就像雕刻的大理石一样——我等着他能说一些我可以理解的话，但他的手一直托着下巴，手指放在嘴唇上。令我惊讶的是，他的手和脸一样消瘦。我心里涌起了一阵也许是不必要的怜悯之情，感动得说话了：

“要是黛安娜或玛丽能来跟你做伴多好啊！你孤零零一个人，实在太糟糕了，而你对自己的健康又那么不重视。”

“没那回事。必要的时候我会照顾好我自己的。我现在很好，你觉得我有什么不妥吗？”

这些话是用一种毫不在乎、心不在焉的漠然神情说出来的。这表明至少在他看来，我的关心是多余的。我选择了沉默。

他依然把手指缓慢地在上唇上滑动，他的眼睛出神地停留在了通红的炉栅上，好像有什么紧急、重要的事情要说。我觉得必须要马上说点什么，就问他是不是感到门那儿有冷风吹来，因为他是背门而坐的。

“没，没有。”他回答很简洁，甚至还有些恼火。

“好吧，”我想，“要是你不想聊天，那你就自己安静地待着好了。我不管你了，我要继续看书了。”

因此，我剪了一下灯芯，继续往下读《玛米昂》。不久他就有了反应，我的目光也立即被他的动作吸引；只见他取出一个摩洛哥的袖珍笔记本，里面夹着一封信，他取出来默默地读了一遍后，又把它折起来，放回远处，接着又重新陷入沉思。我眼前有这么一个难以捉摸的人，想要继续看书是不可能了；但我不愿意当哑巴，他要是不高兴，尽可拒绝我，但我必须要与他交谈。

“最近黛安娜和玛丽来信了吗？”

“只有一周前给你看的那封信，别的就没有了。”

“你自己的安排没有什么变动吧？该不会叫你比你估计得更早离开英国吧？”

“说实话，恐怕不会。如果是这样的话就太好了，可是这样的机会不会落到我头上。”

到现在为止，谈话进展不顺利，我就转变了话题——我想可以谈谈学校和我的学生。

“玛丽·加勒特的母亲身体有所好转。今天早上玛丽就回学校上课了。我下周打算接受四个从铸造厂区过来的新同学。要不是下雪，她们今天就过来了。”

“真的！”

“奥利弗先生支付其中两个学生的学费。”

“他会吗？”

“他还打算在圣诞节那天请全校的师生吃一顿。”

“我知道。”

“是你的建议吗？”

“不是。”

“那是谁的建议？”

“我想肯定是他女儿的提议。”

“这倒像她的做法，她总是那么善良。”

“是呀。”

谈话又一次冷场。表的钟声响了八下，已经八点了。这倒提醒了他。他把架起的那条腿放下来，转向我，笔直地坐着。

“把你的书放一会儿吧，离火炉再近点。”他说。

我有些纳闷，而且是非常纳闷，就答应了他。

“半小时之前，”他接着说，“我曾说要迫不及待地听一个故事的续篇。可是后来想了一下，觉得这件事情还是由我来叙述，你来听比较好。在讲这个故事之前，最好警告你一下，你听起这个故事来，也许会觉得陈旧；但是陈旧的细节经由新的嘴唇来讲述，往往会在一定程度上恢复它的新鲜。至于其他方面，不管它是陈腐还是新奇，故事并不长。

“二十年前，一个穷苦的牧师——不要管他叫什么名字——爱上了一个有钱人家的女儿；那个有钱人家的女儿也爱上了他，并且不顾朋友们的劝告和他结了婚。一结婚，朋友们就都跟她断绝了联系。结婚不到两年，这一对草率的夫妻就双双过世，安安静静地并肩合葬在一块石板下面。（我曾经见过他们的坟墓，它成了大墓地里辅路的一部分。那个大墓地就在某某郡一个过度发展的工业城市里，在那所给煤烟熏黑的可怕的古老大教堂周围。）他们留下了一个女儿，她一生下来就落入了慈善事业的膝头——那膝头像我今晚陷进去几乎不能自拔的积雪一样冰冷。慈善把这个无亲无故的小东西送到了她有钱的亲戚那里，由她的舅妈，盖茨黑德的里德太太抚养——这会儿我要提名字了。你吓了一跳——听见什么响动了？我猜想不过是一只老鼠，爬过毗邻教室的大梁。这里原先是个谷仓，谷仓向来是老鼠出没的地方，后来我整修改建了一下。继续往下说。里德太太抚养了这个孤儿十年，她在那儿是否幸福快乐我不敢说，因为从来没有人告诉过我。但是十年之后，她就被转移到了另外一个地方，这个地方你是知道的，那就是洛伍德寄宿学校，那个你住了很多年的地方。看来，她在那里的经历还很不错，先是学生，后来又留校当了老师，就像你一样。我觉得她的身世和你的有一些相同的地方——随后她离开那里做了一名家庭教师。做家庭教师的命运和你又很相像；在那里，她教育一个由罗切斯特先生收养的孩子。”

“里弗斯先生！”我打断他。

“我能猜出你此时的感受，”他说，“但是忍耐一会儿，我的故事快要结束了，听我讲故事的结尾。关于罗切斯特先生本人我知之甚少，一个不容置疑的事实就是他宣称要与这位年轻的女子结婚；可是就在他们站在圣坛的那一刻，这位姑娘突然发现罗切斯特先生原来早有妻室，并且他的妻子现在还活着，只是疯了而已。他接下来的行为和求婚只不过是想当然而已；但当有一件事情必须要询问这位女教师的时候，这才发现她已经离开了；没有人知道她是什么时候走的，到哪里去了，怎么去的。她是晚上离开桑菲尔德庄园的；她可能走的每一条线路都找过了，但都是徒劳；差不多整个国家都找遍了，也还是没有她的一点消息。找到她成了最急迫的一件事情，因此各种各样的报纸都登了寻人广告，我自己也收到了一位布里格斯先生的信，他在信中向我通报了其中的细节，这个故事是不是很奇怪？”

“你只要告诉我，”我说，“既然你知道得这么多，你当然能够告诉我罗切斯特先生的情况。他现在怎么样了，他过得好不好，现在在哪里？”

“关于罗切斯特先生，我一点都不知道。这封信也从来没有提及他的情况，只是提到了我刚才提及的他不诚实以及不合法的企图。比起这个，你更应该问问那个女家庭教师的名字以及非要她出面不可的这件事情到底是什么。”

“那么没有人去过桑菲尔德庄园吗？就没有人见过罗切斯特先生吗？”

“我想是的。”

“可是他们给他写过信吗？”

“当然。”

“他说什么了？谁有他的信？”

“布里格斯先生只告诉我，给他的回信不是罗切斯特先生本人写的，而是由一位太太回复的，信上的署名是‘艾丽斯·费尔法克斯’。”

我觉得又冷又沮丧，那么我担心的最可怕的事情极有可能会变成现实。他完全有可能离开英国，走投无路之中，轻率地冲到欧洲大陆以前常去的地方。他在那里，会为他的痛苦找到什么样的麻醉剂，会为他强烈的激情寻找一个什么样的目标呢？我不敢想象这些问题的答案。天哪，我可怜的主人，差一点成了我的丈夫，我还曾经称他“我亲爱的爱德华”呢。

“他肯定不是一个好人。”里弗斯先生说。

“你不了解他，就不要对他发表任何看法。”我激动地说。

“好的，”他平心静气地答道，“其实我倒并不关心他，我想结束我的故事。既然你没有问那个女家庭教师的名字，我得主动告诉你。稍等！——名字在这儿——看到几个要点都白纸黑字清清楚楚地记下来，总是更能令人满意的。”

他再次不慌不忙地拿出那个皮夹子，打开，仔细翻找起来，从一个夹层抽出一张纸条。我从纸条的质地和蓝一块、青一块、红一块的污渍就能认出这是他原先从我这里匆忙撕下的那张纸条。他站起来，把它拿到离我眼睛最近的地方，我看到了用黑墨写下的“简·爱”两字，是我自己的笔迹——那肯定是我无意间留下的。

“布里格斯写信给我，向我打听一个叫简·爱的人，”他说，“好几个广告都要找这样一个人。我不认识什么简·爱，而我认识的一个人叫简·爱略特。我承认，我以前有过怀疑，可是直到昨天下午才证实了我的猜测。你承认你叫简·爱，而取消你的化名吗？”

“是的——是的——不过布里格斯先生现在在哪儿？他也许比你更了解罗切斯特先生的情况。”

“布里格斯先生在伦敦。我怀疑他也不知道罗切斯特先生的任何事情，他对什么罗切斯特先生的情况不感兴趣。你现在只顾追问小事，倒把重要的事情给忘了。你就不问问布里格斯先生为什么要找你，他找你的目的是什么？”

“哦，他找我干什么？”

“不过是要告诉你，你的叔父，住在马德拉群岛的爱先生去世了。他把他的全部财产都留给了你，现在你有钱了，就这事，没别的了。”

“我？有钱了？”

“是的，你有钱了——一位不折不扣的女继承人。”

随后又是沉默。

“在此之前有必要验证一下你的身份，”圣·约翰说道，“不过这只是手续问题，你马上就可以得到遗产。你的财产都投资在英国公债上，布里格斯那边有遗嘱和一些必要的文件。”

命运又翻出一张新牌来！读者呀，瞬间从贫穷到拥有财富是一件好事情；但好归好，没有一件事情能让人立刻理解或享受。生命中有许多比这更刺激、更让人高兴的事情；这个事情很具体，是现实世界中的东西，没有任何理想成分；它所联系着的一切都实实在在、朴朴素素，它所体现的也完全一样。一个人一听到自己得到一笔财产，通常不会一跃而起，高呼万岁，而是开始考虑自己的责任，谋划正经事儿。称心满意之余，生出某种沉重的心事来——于是我们克制自己，皱起眉头为幸福陷入了沉思。

另外，遗产、遗赠这些词都与死亡、葬礼等不好的词语相联系。我听说我的叔叔，我唯一的一个亲戚去世了——自从知道他存在的那一天起，我就很珍惜他，希望哪一天可以见到他——现在我永远没有机会了。他的遗产都留给了我，只是留给了我自己，而不是留给我和一个快乐幸福的家庭。毫无疑问，这是一个巨大的恩惠，独立自主也是一件好事情，是的，我已经感觉到了，这种思想正在吞噬我的心。

“你终于抬起头来了，”里弗斯先生说，“我以为美杜莎[1]已经瞧过你，你现在正变为石头呢。也许这会儿你会问你的身价有多少？”

“我的身价有多少？”

“哦，肯定少得可怜！不值一提——我想他们说的是两万英镑吧——但那又有什么意思呢？”

“两万英镑？”

这又是一件惊人的事情——我原来估计也就四五千英镑。这个消息让我目瞪口呆了好一会儿。我从没有听到过圣·约翰先生的笑声，这时他却大笑起来。

“嗯，”他说，“我觉得，就是你杀了人，我告诉你，你的罪行已经被发现了，你也不会比现在更诧异。”

“这是很大一笔钱——你不会弄错了吧？”

“一点没错。”

“也许你把数字看错了——可能是两千吧？”

“不是用数字，是用字母写的。是两万。”

我再次感觉到颇像一个中等胃口的人，独自坐在可供一百人享用的盛宴面前。这会儿里弗斯先生站起来，穿上了斗篷，准备告辞了。

“如果不是这个十分恶劣的天气，”他说，“我会叫汉娜来跟你做伴。你一个人太可怜了。不过汉娜也是可怜的女人。她不像我这样善于走积雪的路，她的腿不够长，所以只好让你一个人伤心难过了。晚安！”

他再次提起门闩，突然我想起了一个问题。

“请再等一分钟！”我叫道。

“怎么了？”

“我不明白为什么布里格斯先生会向你打听我的事情？或者说他怎么知道你清楚我的情况？他怎么会想到你这个住在这样偏僻角落里的人有能力找到我呢？”

“哦，你忘了我是个牧师，”他说，“稀奇古怪的事情往往都向牧师求助。”门闩又一次咯咯响了起来。

“不，那不能使我满意！”我嚷道，其实他那么匆忙而不作解释的回答，不但没有消除我的好奇心，反而更刺激了它。

“这件事非常奇怪，”我补充说，“我需要进一步了解一下。”

“改天再谈吧。”

“不行，就今天晚上说！——今天晚上！”

他从门边转过身来时，我站到了他与门之间，弄得他有些尴尬。

“你如果不把事情的真相全部告诉我，你就别想走。”我说。

“现在我还是不说为好。”

“你要说！——一定得说！”

“我情愿让黛安娜和玛丽告诉你。”

当然，他的反复拒绝把我的焦急心情推向了顶点：我必须得到满足，而且不容拖延。我把我此时的心情告诉了他。

“不过我告诉过你，我是个铁石心肠的男人，”他说，“很难说服。”

“而我是个铁石心肠的女人，是不能搪塞过去的。”

“那么，”他继续说，“我很冷漠，任何热情都不能感化我。”

“而我很热情，火是用来融化冰的。那边的火已经化掉了你斗篷上所有的雪，由于同样原因，雪水淌到了我的地板上，弄得像踩踏过的街道。你把地上铺满沙子的厨房弄脏了，你里弗斯先生也曾经要求我原谅你的这种罪恶，那你就把你知道的事情告诉我吧。”

“好吧，”他说，“我让步了，要不是向你的真诚屈服，就是向你水滴石穿的恒心投降。另外，早晚有一天你会知道，早晚知道都是一样的。你的名字叫简·爱，对吗？”

“是的，这个问题之前已经解决了。”

“你也许没有意识到我跟你同姓？我施洗礼时被命名为圣·约翰·爱·里弗斯？”

“确实没有！现在可记起来了，我曾在你不同时间借给我的书里，看到你名字开头的几个字母中有一个E，但我从来没有问过它代表什么。不过那又怎么样？当然……”

我突然停住了。我不能相信自己会有这样的想法，更不敢表达出来。但是这想法闯入了我的脑海，顷刻之间，变成了确确实实可能的事情。种种情况凑合起来了，各就各位，变成了一个有条有理的整体，一根链条。以前一直是一堆没有形状的环，现在被一节节拉直了——每一个环都完好无缺，环与环之间的联结也很完整。圣·约翰还没有开口，我凭直觉就已经知道是怎么回事了。不过我不能期望读者也有同样的直觉，因此我得重复一下他的说明：

“我母亲的姓氏是爱，她有两个兄弟，一个是位牧师，他娶了盖茨黑德府的简·里德小姐；另一个叫约翰·爱先生，生前在马德拉群岛的沙韦尔经商。布里格斯先生是爱先生的律师，去年八月份写信告知我们舅舅去世的消息，并且还告诉我们，他把所有财产都给了他哥哥的孤女。由于我父亲与他之间一次永远无法冰释的争吵，他忽视了我们。几周前，布里格斯又写信来，说是那位女继承人失踪了，问我是否知道她的情况。一个随意写在纸条上的名字使我找到了她，接下来的事情你都知道了。”他又要走，我用背将门顶住。

“请务必让我也说一说，”我说，“让我喘口气，好好想一想。”我停住了——他站在我面前，手里拿着帽子，看上去很镇静。我接着说：

“你的母亲是我父亲的姐妹？”

“是的。”

“那么就是我的姑妈了？”

他点了点头。

“我的叔叔约翰就是你们的舅舅约翰，对吗？你、黛安娜还有玛丽是他姐妹的孩子，我是他兄弟的孩子，对吗？”

“没错。”

“你们三个是我的表亲，我们几个身上一半的血都来自同一个地方，对吗？”

“我们是表兄妹，是的。”

我细细打量着他。看来我找到了一个哥哥，一个我引以为荣、可以深爱的哥哥；我还找到了两个姐姐，她们的品质，在她们还把我当陌生人的时候，就已经引起了我由衷的爱和崇敬。那天我跪在潮湿的地上，透过低格子的窗户，充满好奇和绝望地看到的那两个姑娘，竟然是我的亲戚；那个发现我就要死在他家门口的那位年轻而又严肃的先生，竟然是我的表兄。这对孤独的我来说是一个多么伟大的发现哪！这确实是一笔财富，是心灵的一笔财富，是纯洁而友善的感情。这是一种幸福，光辉灿烂、生气勃勃、令人振奋！——不像沉重的黄金礼物：本身值钱而受人欢迎，但它的分量又让人感到压抑。这会儿我突然兴奋得拍起手来，我的脉搏跳动着，我的血管震颤着。

“哦，我真高兴——我真高兴！”我叫道。

圣·约翰笑了笑。“我不是说过你为了一些琐事而丢掉了重要的事情这样的话吗？”他说，“当我告诉你你将继承一大笔遗产的时候，你是那么的严肃；而现在为了一件不重要的事情，你却那么兴奋。”

“你说这话是什么意思呢？对你来说可能无关紧要，因为你已经有了两个妹妹，有没有我这个表妹并不在乎；但是我以前没有一个亲人，现在一下子却有了三个成人的亲人或两个——如果你不愿意包括在内的话，那就是两个——突然进入到我的生命中来，我再说一遍，我很高兴！”

我快步地在房间里面走动，我停住脚步，脑子里蹦出的思想快得叫我来不及接受、理解和安排，我几乎连气都透不过来；想着以后可能怎么样，能够怎么样，会怎么样，该怎么样。我看着空空如也的墙壁，好像是布满繁星的天空，每一颗星星都能给我一个目标、一种快乐。那些救过我的命，到现在我还爱着的那些人，现在是报答你们的时候了。他们现在都生活在禁锢中，我可以解放他们；他们分开了，我可以让他们重新团聚；我独立了，富有了，他们也要像我一样。我们不是有四个人吗？两万英镑平均分成四份，每人可以有五千英镑，够多了；这样公正地做了，彼此的幸福也就有了保障。金钱不能让我心绪不宁，现在对我而言，已经不是金钱的馈赠，而是一笔关于生活、希望和享受的遗产。

当这些想法占据我的灵魂的时候，我的神态如何，我无从知晓；但是我很快觉察到里弗斯先生已在我背后放了一把椅子，和和气气地要我坐下。他还劝我镇静，这等于暗示我当时束手无策和精神错乱。我对他的做法嗤之以鼻，把他的手推开，又开始走动起来。

“明天就写信给黛安娜和玛丽，”我说，“让她们马上回家来。黛安娜说如果她有一千英镑，她就认为自己很有钱了。现在她有了五千英镑，她们肯定感觉更不错了。”

“我去给你倒一杯水，”圣·约翰说，“我认为你真得好好地让自己的感情冷静一下了。”

“胡说！这笔遗产对你会有什么样的影响？它会让你留在英格兰，会让你和奥利弗小姐结婚，像一个凡人那样安顿下来吗？”

“你跑题了，你的大脑开始混乱了。这个消息我告诉你太仓促了，超出了你自制力的范围。”

“里弗斯先生！你让我有些不耐烦了！我现在很清醒，是你误解了我的意思，或者是你有意要曲解我的话。”

“要是你解释得再详细一点，我就更明白了。”

“解释！有什么需要解释的？两万英镑，也就是提到的这笔钱，我们四个人，一个外甥、二个外甥女和一个侄女平分的话，一人各得五千英镑，你不会不知道吧？我想要做的是，你应当写信给你的妹妹们，告诉她们所得的财产。”

“你的意思是你所得的财产吧？”

“我已经告诉你我在这件事情上的态度，除此之外，我不可能有别的想法。我不是一个盲目自私和忘恩负义的人；此外，我一心认定我会有一个家和几个亲人。我喜欢沼泽居，喜欢住在沼泽居；我喜欢黛安娜和玛丽，我愿意把我自己的生命同她们联系在一起。拥有五千英镑，我就很高兴和知足了。独自占有两万英镑会使我感到压抑，备受折磨。而且，如果我独自运用两万英镑，虽然在法律上它是公平的，但在道德上它是不公正的。那我只好把那些对我来说多余的钱还给你们。不要再反对，也不要再讨论了；让我们彼此协调一致，立刻把它定下来吧。”

“你的这种做法只不过是一时冲动，对于这件事情你必须好好考虑几天再做决定。在这之前说的话都可以视为无效。”

“天哪！如果你只是怀疑我的诚意我就放心了，你也看到这件事情的公正性了？”

“我的确看到了某种公平性，可是这违反常规。另外，继承整份财产是你的权利，它是我的舅舅通过自己的努力赚来的，他有选择把财产留给谁的自由。他把财产留给了你，毕竟在法律上允许你来拥有它，你可以问心无愧地完全拥有它。”

“对我来说，这完全是一个良心的问题，也是一个感情的问题。我必须要放纵自己的感情，尽管以前我很少有机会这么做。”我说，“就算是你争论、反对、生我一年的气，我也不能放弃初见端倪的快乐，那就是报答你们的帮助，为我自己赢得值得信赖一生的朋友。”

“你现在这么想，是因为你不知道拥有财富和享受财富的滋味。”圣·约翰说，“你不能理解两万英镑遗产对你有什么样的重要性，也不明白它将会给你带来怎样的社会地位，会给你来什么样的希望，你不能……”

“而你，”我打断了他，“绝对无法想象我多么渴望兄弟姐妹之情。我从来没有家，从来没有兄弟姐妹。我现在必须有也马上会有了，你不会不愿接受我、承认我吧？”

“简，我会成为你的哥哥，我的妹妹会成为你的姐姐，但是你没有必要牺牲自己的正当权利作为条件。”

“哥哥？是的，他在千里之外的地方！姐姐？不错，她们正在受陌生人的奴役！我，富有了，一个人享受着我从来没有见过的那么多钱！你们，一无所有！这就是赫赫有名的平等和友爱！多么紧密的团聚，何等亲切的依恋！”

“可是，简，你对亲属关系和家庭幸福的渴望，除了通过你思索的方式实现外，也可以通过别的途径来实现，你可以嫁人。”

“又胡说八道！嫁人！我不想嫁人，永远不嫁。”

“那说得有些过分了，这种鲁莽的断言证实了你还处于过度兴奋之中。”

“我并没有说得过分：我知道我自己是怎么想的，我现在都懒得去想结婚那事。没有人会因为爱而和我结婚，我又不愿意当金钱买卖的对象。我不想嫁给一个陌生人，与我没有共同语言，格格不入，截然不同。我只需要血肉至亲，需要那些与我有同胞感情的人。请再说一遍你愿意当我的哥哥；听到这个，我会很满意，很幸福；如果你可以，我还希望你能真诚地重复几遍。”

“我想我能。我明白我总是爱着我的妹妹们，我也明白我的爱是建立在什么基础上的，那就是对她们价值的尊重，对她们才能的钦佩。你也有原则和思想，你的趣味和习惯与黛安娜和玛丽很相近。有你在场我总感到很愉快；在与你的交谈中，我早已发现了一种有益的安慰。我觉得可以自然而轻易地在我心里留出位置给你，把你看做我的第三个或最小的妹妹。”

“谢谢你，这句话使我今晚很满意。现在你最好还是走吧，因为要是你再待下去，你也许会用某种不信任的顾虑再惹我生气。”

“那么学校呢，爱小姐？现在我想得关掉了吧。”

“不，我会一直保留女教师的职位，直到你找到接替我的人。”

他满意地笑了笑。我们握了手，他告辞了。

我想我没必要再赘述我为遗产的分配问题作的进一步斗争、争论了。反正这个工作很难办，但我已经决定，我的表兄妹们最后看到，我要公正地分配财产的想法已经不可改变地定了下来，也许还因为他们在内心一定感到这种想法是公平的，此外，也一定本来就意识到他们如处在我的地位，也一样会做我希望做的事——最后他们让步了，同意把事情交付公断。奥利弗先生和另一位有担当的律师做见证人，他们和我想法一致，于是我实现了自己的想法。遗产转移合同已经草拟完毕，圣·约翰、黛安娜、玛丽和我都有资格继承遗产了。

第三十四章


当一切都安排妥当的时候，圣诞节来临了。这个普通的假日马上来到了。现在我关闭了莫尔顿学校，并注意放假时不能让学生空手而归无所表示。交上好运气使人心境愉快，并且出手也非常大方。为了给自己不寻常的激动感情一个表达的理由，我把得到的大量的东西分给了学生们。很早的时候我就高兴地感觉到很多农村学生都喜欢我。当我们离别时，那种感觉被证实了，她们朴素而强烈地表达她们的感情。令我感到非常喜悦的是我发现自己在她们天真无邪的心灵中确实有一席之地，并且答应以后每周我都会去看望她们，在学校里给她们讲一小时的课。

里弗斯先生过来了，现在学校里面一共有六十多名学生。看到班里的学生在我面前走出教室，然后我锁上了教室门，这时我手拿着钥匙站在那里，和五六个最优秀的学生说着告别的话。这几个英国农民阶层中成长的姑娘举止得体，品格高尚，谦逊并且见多识广。这样说意义深远，毕竟英国农民是欧洲农民中最有教养、最懂得礼貌、最有自尊心的。从那以后，我见过一些法国和德国农妇，和莫尔顿的姑娘相比，就是她们中最出色的也显得很愚昧、粗俗和愚蠢。

“辛苦忙碌了一个季节，你认为付出的努力得到回报了吗？”她们离开后，里弗斯先生问，“你认为在你自己精力最充沛的年青时代做些有意义的好事会给你带来快乐吗？”

“当然。”

“而你只劳累了几个月，要是把你的一生都奉献给提升自己民族的事业不是很有意义吗？”

“是的。”我说，“但是我不能永远这样做下去。和培养别人一样，我还要施展我自己的才能，我现在就必须施展。不要让我的身心恢复到在学校时候的状态，我厌倦了，只想安心过一个完整的假期。”

他很严肃地看着我，“现在怎么了？为什么突然显得那么急切，你想表达什么意思？你准备做什么呢？”

“为了变成积极主动的一员，要尽我所能积极主动，首先我求你给汉娜自由，另外再找人服侍你。”

“你需要她吗？”

“对。我需要她和我一块去沼泽居。一周之后黛安娜和玛丽就要回家里了，我想把一切收拾得干干净净欢迎她们的归来。”

“我知道了。我还以为你要长途旅行呢。这样也好，让汉娜和你一块儿去收拾吧。”

“告诉她明天以前做好准备，教室钥匙在这儿。我明天早上把小屋的钥匙给你。”

他接过钥匙。“你倒是很高兴地放弃这份工作了，”他说，“我不是很懂你轻松的心情，因为我不能够告诉自己你要找什么工作来顶替你放弃的工作。现在你生活中的目标、目的和雄心是什么呢？”

“我首先要做的事情是清理（你能理解这样表达的全部力量吗？），从每个房间到地窖都打扫一遍；我要做的第二件事情是用蜂蜡、油和数不清的布把它们擦得像以前一样锃亮；我要做的第三件事情是按照数学的准确程度来安排每一把椅子、每一张桌子、每一张床和地毯的位置，然后我要充分利用你的煤和泥炭，把每个房间都生起火来；最后，汉娜和我会在你的妹妹们快要到的前两天里好好忙活上两天，打鸡蛋、精选葡萄干、磨调料、做圣诞蛋糕、剁做馅用的肉，还要隆重地操持其他烹饪风俗。像你这种外行，就是用语言也难以充分表达这番忙碌的情景。一句话，我的意思就是下周四黛安娜和玛丽来到之前，做好充分的准备。我的雄心就是她们来到时给她们一个最热情的欢迎。”

圣·约翰微微一笑，还是不满意。

“目前这么做很好，”他说，“不过说实在的，我相信当第一阵快活的冲动结束以后，你会看得更远，而不只是局限于家人的亲热和家庭的欢乐之中。”

“这是人世间最美好的东西啊！”我打断他说。

“不是，简，不是的，这个世界不是享受的地方，不要尝试把它变成这样，这也不是一个休息的地方，不要变得懈怠。”

“我的意思恰恰相反，要保持忙碌。”

“简，眼下我能原谅你，我给你两个月清闲的时间来充分享受你的新工作，也为刚刚找到亲戚好好高兴一番。但从今以后，我希望你能开阔视野，看得更远些，超越沼泽居、莫尔顿和姊妹之情，超越自己的安逸以及文明富裕所带来的肉体享受。我希望到那时你的充沛精力会再次让你跃跃欲试。”

我吃惊地看着他。“圣·约翰，”我说，“我认为你这样说太邪恶了。我希望自己像女皇那样心满意足，但你却要弄得我心烦意乱！你有什么目的？”

“我的目的是让上帝赐予你的才能发挥作用，并且上帝会在某天要求你对你的才能报账。简，我会密切而焦急地关注你——我警告你：要尽力克制把自己投入平凡的家庭中所流露出的过分的热情；不要过分地迷恋肉体上的联系，把你的坚定和热情留给一项适合的事业，避免把它浪费在平庸而又短暂的事情上。知道了吗，简？”

“知道了，好像你在说希腊文。我认为我有充分的理由保持快乐，我将会很愉快。再见！”

我在沼泽居的日子很快乐，我工作也很努力，汉娜也一样。她入迷地看我在这栋房子里忙得不亦乐乎，看我扫地呀、擦灰尘呀、清理呀、做饭呀。确实，那混乱无秩序的一两天以后，当我们从自己所制造的混乱中渐渐理出了头绪时，我们感到非常高兴。来这之前，为了买些新家具我去了一趟S城，我的表兄表姐把大权给我，只要我满意可以对房间作任何布置，并为这事情专门拿出一笔钱作为装修费用。普通的起居室和寝室，我尽量保持它们原来的样子，因为我知道黛安娜和玛丽再一次看到朴实的桌子、椅子和床时会比看到最整齐的装修更高兴。但是赋予它们某些新颖的东西也是必要的，因为我希望她们回家的时候能够感受到一种我所希望的新鲜和刺激。于是我又配上黑色漂亮的新地毯、新窗帘和几件经过精心挑选的、古色古香的瓷器和铜器做装饰，以及新床罩、镜子和梳妆台上的化妆盒等等，它们看上去鲜艳但并不刺眼。一间空余的客厅和卧室，我用古色古香的红木家具和大红的帷幔全部重新布置了一遍。在过道里铺了帆布，楼梯上铺了地毯。当一切都完成了以后，在这个季节里我想沼泽居堪称室内光亮舒适的典范，同时又是室外严冬凋零衰败、满目凄凉的反衬。

令人期待的星期四终于来到了，估计她们得天黑时分到。黄昏之前，我就把楼上楼下都生了火，厨房里面打扫得干干净净。汉娜和我都穿戴得整整齐齐，一切都准备好了。

圣·约翰先到了。我求他，为了室内整洁，请他等全都安排好了再进来。老实说，光看看四周这又脏又乱的样子，就足以把他吓得躲得远远的。他见我在厨房里，正在烘烤茶点用饼，于是走近炉子问我：“你是不是对女仆的活儿感到满意了？”为了回答他，我领着他全面地察看一下我辛苦劳动的成果。我终于说动他能到房子里转一转，但他也只是从我替他打开的门缝向里瞧了一瞧。他在楼上楼下看了一圈后说，肯定是费了很大力气和麻烦，才能在如此短的时间内带来这么大的变化。但是面貌改变后给他带来了什么，他只字未提。

这种沉默让我失望。我心里想，是不是这些改变打乱了他所珍惜的某些往事的联想。我询问他是不是这个原因，语气中夹杂着灰心丧气的腔调。

“不是。恰恰相反，我想你认真考虑了所有与之有关的情形。老实说，我害怕你在这上面花费太多精力，这不值得。举个例子，在考虑布置这间房间时你花了多少时间？——随便问一下，某某书放在哪儿了你知道吗？”

我给他指了指书架上的那本书。他拿下来，像平常一样躲到窗子旁边的角落里，埋头看了起来。

读者啊，这时候，我讨厌他这副模样。圣·约翰是个好人，他说自己铁石心肠时，我开始觉得他说的是实话。人间的喜怒哀乐对他没有吸引力——静静的享受也吸引不了他。他活着的目的就是为了追求——当然是追求杰出伟大的东西。但他从不停歇，也不同意身边的其他人休息。当我瞧着他平静的高耸的额头宛如白色的岩石——看着他陷入沉思的优美的面容时，我马上想到他不可能成为一个好丈夫，做他的妻子是个苦差事。我才恍然领悟到他对奥利弗小姐爱的本质。我同意他的观点，那只不过是一种感官的爱。我明白了他为什么会因为这种爱给他带来的狂热感情而蔑视自己，为何会希望阻止和毁灭它，为何不相信爱会对他或她的幸福永远有帮助。我知道他是一块大自然造就出来的英雄材料——基督教徒和异教徒英雄——法律制定者、政治家、征服者。他是巨大利益的坚强堡垒，但是在家中，他却总像一根冰冷笨重的柱子，阴郁沉闷，与现实相距甚远。

“这间客厅不是他待的地方，”我暗忖道，“喜马拉雅山山谷或者南非丛林，甚至是瘟疫盛行的几内亚海岸的沼泽，那里才是他的用武之地。他可以毫无顾忌地放弃平静的家庭。家庭不应该是他的活动场所，在家里他的官能会变得呆滞，无法施展或发挥作用。只有在充满斗争和危险的环境中——显示勇气、发挥能力、考验毅力韧性的地方——他才会像一个首领和长官那样说话和做事。而在家里，他甚至不如一个快乐的孩子。他选择做一个传教士是正确的——现在我可以理解了。”

“来啦！来啦！”汉娜“砰”地推开客厅门嚷道。就在这个时候，老卡罗也高兴地汪汪大叫起来。我冲了出去，这时天黑了，但是能听得见车轮的声音。汉娜马上点亮了提灯。车子停在了便门旁边，车夫打开车门，一个熟悉的身影走了出来，紧接着另一个又走了出来。一瞬间我的面庞就埋到了她们的帽子底下，首先触到了玛丽柔软的脸蛋，然后是黛安娜飘逸的鬈发。她们欢笑着——亲了亲我——随后又亲了亲汉娜，拍了拍卡罗，卡罗十分高兴。她们急切地问大家是否一切都好，在得到肯定的答复之后，就匆忙进了屋。

从惠特克劳斯到这里，她们一路舟车劳顿，弄得浑身僵硬，夜间的寒气一定把她们冻坏了。所以一见到令人振奋的火光，她们便露出了快乐的笑容。当车夫和汉娜忙着把行李拿进屋的时候，她们问圣·约翰在哪里。这时圣·约翰才从客厅里走了出来。她们俩立刻搂住了他的脖子，他轻轻地吻了每个人一下，小声说了几句欢迎的话，站在那里同她们说了一会儿话，然后说他们很快会在客厅会面，像避难一样退回了客厅。

为了让她们上楼，我事先点好了蜡烛，但是黛安娜周到地交代了几句招待车夫的话后，两人就一直跟在我后面。对房间的整修和装饰，她们非常满意，对新的帷幔、新的地毯和色泽艳丽的瓷花瓶装饰品她们也很满意，对我表达了强烈的感激之情。我非常高兴，我完全是根据她们的愿望来安排的，我所做的一切为她们快乐的回家之旅增加了生动的魅力。

那个夜晚真的很甜蜜。高兴的表姐们，口才非常棒，又是叙述又是讨论，她们热烈的交谈掩盖了圣·约翰的沉默。对妹妹们的到来，他发自内心地感到高兴，但是她们洋溢的热情、无尽的喜悦都无法引起他的共鸣。当天的大事——黛安娜和玛丽的回家——说到这里他感到很高兴，但是随之而来的热闹欢腾，喋喋不休，隆重的款待，使他厌倦。我知道他盼望宁静的第二天快点来临。用完茶点后一个小时，这种欢乐的气氛达到了顶峰。就在这时传来了一阵敲门声，汉娜进来说：“一个可怜的孩子，来得可真不是时候，请里弗斯先生去看看她的母亲，她快要死了。”

“她住哪儿，汉娜？”

“一直要到惠特克劳斯坡呢，差不多四英里的路程，一路上都是沼泽和青苔。”

“告诉他我马上就去。”

“先生，我认为你还是不去为好。天这么黑，走这样的路是很危险的，整个沼泽地都没有路，而且又碰上了这样的坏天气——从来没有刮过这么大的风——先生，你还是捎个话，明天再去吧。”

但他已经披上斗篷，站在走廊里了，毫不反对，毫无怨言，然后出发了。那时候已经是晚上九点钟了。到了半夜他才回来，尽管冻得够呛，身子疲乏，但是看起来比出发时还愉快。他又尽了一份责任、一份努力，觉得自己有舍己利人的魄力，自我感觉很不错。

我害怕接下来的七天，他会很不耐烦。这是圣诞周，我们无事可做，都陶醉在家庭的欢乐气氛之中。荒原上的空气、家里无拘无束的氛围、美好的希望，对黛安娜和玛丽的心灵来说，就像能够治疗百病的良药。从上午到下午，从下午到晚上，她们都快乐着。她们总能找到话题，她们的谈话机敏、精辟、具有独创性，我被她们深深地吸引了。我喜欢聆听和参与，胜过喜欢干其他一切别的事情。圣·约翰对我们的说笑并没有意见，但是无法回避。他平常不在家，他的工作范围很大，由于人口分布很广，访问不同地区的贫苦人家，便成了每天的家常便饭。

一天早晨，吃早饭时，黛安娜有几分钟的时间显得有些忧郁，随后就问他：“你的计划变了没有？”

“没有，也不可能变。”他回答道。他然后告诉我们，他准备明年离开英国。

“那么罗莎蒙德·奥利弗呢？”玛丽问。这句话好像是随口说出来的，因为她刚说完便做了手势，好像要把这话收回去。圣·约翰手里拿着一本书——吃饭的时候看书是他跟普通人不一样的习惯——他合上书，把头抬了起来。

“罗莎蒙德·奥利弗，”他说，“她准备和格兰比先生结婚了。他是弗雷德里克·格兰比爵士的孙子和继承人，是S城里家庭背景最好、最德高望重的公民之一。昨天我从他父亲那儿得到这个消息。”

黛安娜和玛丽互相看了看，然后又看了我一眼。我们都看着他，他看起来像一块玻璃那样平静。

“这桩婚事肯定是订得很匆忙，”黛安娜说，“他们不可能认识很久的。”

“有两个月了。十月份他们在S城的一个乡间舞会上相识。然而，目前这种情况，从各方面考虑，这门亲事都是非常好的，没有什么不妥，根本没有拖延的必要。只要弗雷德里克爵士让给他们住的S府装修好，可以住进去了，他们就结婚。”

这次谈话以后，当我第一次见圣·约翰独自待着的时候，我很想问他一下，对这件事他是不是很伤心。但他好像不需要同情，所以，我没有冒昧地问下去，想起自己以前的冒昧反而觉得很惭愧。另外，我很少与他交谈，他的冷漠像冰霜覆盖了一切，凝固了我的坦率。他没有遵守诺言，像妹妹一样待我，总是不断地表现出那种小小的令人寒心的差别，丝毫没有发展真正感情的意思。总之，自从我被认做他的亲人，并同住一栋房屋后，我觉得我们之间的距离，比当初我是乡村女教师时还要大。当我想起自己曾深得他的信任时，我难以理解他现在的冷漠态度。

这种情况下，他从趴着的书桌上突然抬起头来说话，我感到有些惊讶。

“你看，简，战争已经结束了，而且取得了胜利。”

他这样的说话方式吓了我一跳，我没有马上回答。但是犹豫了一会儿后，说道：

“你能确信自己是那种可以为胜利付出巨大代价的征服者吗？如果再有一次这样的胜利会不会把你毁掉？”

“不会。即使我的处境如此，也没多大关系。我再也不会应召去参加这样的战斗了。战争的结局是决定性的，我的道路已经扫清了，我为此要感谢上帝！”说完后，他又回到文件和沉默中去了。

我们（黛安娜、玛丽和我）之间的欢乐逐渐变得平静起来。我们继续着往常的习惯和有规律的学习，圣·约翰待在家里的时间更长了，与我们一起待在同一个房间里，有时一坐就是几小时。玛丽绘画，黛安娜继续她的《百科全书》阅读课程（我很惊讶和敬畏），我努力学习德文。圣·约翰则探索着自己神秘的学问，那是某种东方语言，他认为要把自己的理想变为现实必须掌握它。

他好像就这么忙碌着，待在属于自己的领地里，不声不响。但是他的蓝眼睛经常离开那些看上去稀奇古怪的语法，转来转去，有时会紧盯着我们三人。一旦与别人的目光接触，他就会立即收回，时不时地又回过来扫一眼我们的桌子。我感到不解。我也弄不明白，在我看来虽然每周去莫尔顿学校上一次课是件小事，可是他每次肯定都抓住机会表示满意。我更不明白的是，如果哪一天天气不好，下雪或下雨，或者风很大，他的妹妹们都会劝我别去，然而他肯定会不考虑她们的关心，鼓励我克服天气因素去完成任务。

“简可不是你们所想象中的那种弱者，”他说，“她会顶着狂风、大雨，或暴雪，和我们一样。她身体健康又有适应能力——比很多身强力壮的人更能承受恶劣的天气变化。”

回到家里，虽然有时经历风吹雨打，身心疲惫，可我从不敢抱怨，因为我知道我一开口他就会生气。不管什么时候，你坚毅不屈不挠，他会为你感到高兴；相反，他会特别生气。

然而，一天下午，我获准留在家里，我确实感冒了。他妹妹们替我去了莫尔顿，我坐下看起席勒的作品来。他在破译天书一样的东方涡卷形字体。当我练习翻译时，碰巧朝他那看了一下，发现自己正处于那双蓝眼睛的监视之下。我都不知道被他从上到下、反反复复地扫视了多长时间。他的目光那样犀利，那样冷酷，刹那间我竟产生了某种错觉——感觉与某种神秘的东西同处一室。

“简，你在干什么？”

“学德语。”

“我要你放弃德语，改学印度斯坦语。”

“你不会当真吧？”

“是真的，我会告诉你原因。”

接下来他继续解释说，印度斯坦语是他目前正在学习的语言，学了后面的容易忘记前面的。如果有个学生，会对他帮助很大，他可以频繁地向她教授那些基本知识，因此自己能够牢记在心。到底是选我还是他的妹妹们，他想了好长时间。最终选中了我，因为他看到我比她们中任何一位都耐得住寂寞。我会帮他吗？可能我不必作太多牺牲，因为还有三个月他就要远行了。

圣·约翰是不能轻易拒绝的。他的每个想法，让你感到痛苦也好，愉快也罢，都是刻骨铭心、终生难忘的。我答应了。黛安娜和玛丽回到家，发现自己的学生转到了她哥哥那里，就开怀大笑。她们都认为，圣·约翰绝对说服不了她们这样做。他平静地回答：

“我知道。”

我发现他是一位很有耐心、克制而且又很苛求的人。他对我抱有很大的希望，然而一旦我达到了他的要求，他就会以自己特有的方式表示认可。渐渐地，他产生了某种左右我的力量，使我失去了自由。他的赞许和在意比他的冷淡更能束缚我。只要一见到他，我就不能谈笑自如，因为有一种令人厌倦的纠缠不休的直觉，时刻告诫我他厌烦轻松活泼（至少在我看来是这样的）。我彻底意识到只有保持认真的态度、做着正式的事儿才能够令他满意，因此只要他在场，你就不能有别的想法。我感觉自己被桎梏在一种凝固的魔力之下。当他说“去”的时候，我就去；他说“来”的时候，我就来；他说“干这事”，我就干这事。但是我不喜欢这种奴役的状态，已经好多次了，我希望他能像以前那样忽视我。

一天夜里，到了睡觉时间，他的妹妹和我都围他站着，跟他道晚安。他习惯地吻了吻两个妹妹，又习惯地把手伸向我。黛安娜正好在玩的兴头上（她并没有痛苦地被他的意志所控制，从另一个方面上说她的性格也很坚强），便嚷道：

“圣·约翰！你以前经常把简当做你的第三个妹妹，可是你却没有像对待妹妹一样待她，你也应该吻她一下。”

她把我推向他。我想黛安娜也是够气人的，一时心里很不舒服。我心里正这么想着并很激动时，圣·约翰低下头，那希腊式的面孔与我的摆到一个水平面上，他的眼神强烈地探索着我的眼睛——他吻了我。这世上没有大理石吻或冰吻一类的说法，不然我会说，我的牧师表哥的吻，就属于这类。也许有试探性的吻，他的也是这样一种吻。吻过我以后，他还看了我一眼，想看看有什么结果。结果当然不明显，我的脸肯定没有变红，我的脸色可能有点儿苍白，因为我感觉这个吻仿佛是束缚我的一个封条。从这以后他再也没有忘记这一礼节，每次我都庄重沉默；我静静地忍受着，在他看来这似乎又为这个吻增添了一定魅力。

对我来说，天天都想更讨他喜欢。可是这么做，我越来越感觉到我必须放弃一半个性，扼杀一半才能，强迫自己改变原有的爱好，迫使自己去追求自己缺乏毅力来完成的事业。他要把我带到我永远无法达到的高度。我时刻都为期望达到他的标准而承受着煎熬。这是不能实现的，就像要把我那不匀称的脸庞，塑造成他正牌的古典模式，也像要把他那海蓝色色泽和严肃的光彩，染到我那不可改变的黑色眼睛里一样。

但是，让我无法动弹的不全是他对我的奴役。这两天我很容易显出一脸伤心，一个腐朽的魔鬼侵入了我的内心，耗尽了我幸福的源泉——这就是焦虑的恶魔。

读者，您可能认为在地点和命运的改变中，我已经忘记了罗切斯特先生。老实说，时刻都没有忘记。我仍然想念他，因为这不是阳光能够驱散的雾气，也不是暴风随便就能够吹散的沙雕。这是一个刻在碑文上的名字，注定了它要像刻着它的大理石那样地久天长。不管我走到哪里，我都希望得到他的消息。在莫尔顿的时候，每晚我一走进那间小屋便想起他来；现在在沼泽居，每晚一走进自己的卧室，一想起他我就会心潮跌宕。

当为了遗嘱的事我必须写信给布里格斯先生时，我问他是否知道罗切斯特先生现在的住所和身体状况。就像圣·约翰猜测的，他对他的状况一点也不了解。我接着写信给费尔法克斯太太，请她谈谈相关情况。我本来认为这次肯定会早早地收到她的回音。然而两个星期过去了，还是没有收到回信，我万分焦急。现在两个月过去了，邮件一封接着一封来到，但始终没有我的信，我因此更加担心了。

我又写了一信，我认为第一封有可能是丢了。新努力带来了新希望，与上次一样开始给了我一点希望，随后也一样渐渐地杳无音信了。我一点消息都没有得到。在焦急的盼望中半年过去了，我的愿望破灭了，以后我觉得真的坠入了黑暗之中。

万里无云的春天，我的心情却没有那么好。夏天快要到了，黛安娜尽力使我兴奋起来，说我脸色不好，要陪我去海边散步。圣·约翰不同意，他说我不需要休息，只是缺少事情做。目前，我的生活没有重心，需要有个目标。我想可能是为了补课，他又延长了我学习印度斯坦语的时间，并且急切地要我去完成。我像一个傻瓜一样，从来没有想到过反抗——也无法反抗他。

一天，我开始做我的功课，情绪比平常还要低落。我的无精打采来源于一种强烈感受到的失望。汉娜早上告诉我有我的信，当我下楼去取信的时候，心里想十拿九稳，应该是我久盼的消息终于来了。但是我却发现这只不过是一封无关紧要的便笺，是布里格斯先生的公务信。我痛苦地极力克制自己，但眼泪涌了出来。而我坐在那里精读印度文字难懂的词句和精彩的比喻时，我又禁不住热泪盈眶了。

圣·约翰把我叫到他身边读书，可是我的嗓子哑了，要读的词语被淹没在抽泣中。客厅里只有我们两个人，黛安娜在休息室练习弹唱，玛丽在修葺园子——这是阳光明媚的五月，天高气爽，阳光明媚，微风拂面。我的同伴对我这种低落的情绪并未表示惊讶，也没有问我什么原因，他只是说：

“我们停几分钟吧，简，等你平静下来再说。”我赶紧忍住阵发的抽搐。而他镇定而有耐心地坐在那里，倚在书桌上，像个医生，用医学的眼光观察着病人的病情，这种病情是在意料之中并且是再明白不过的。我停止哽咽，擦掉眼泪，嘟哝着说早上身体不好，又继续做我的功课。终于做完了，圣·约翰把我们的书放到旁边，锁上书桌，说：

“好吧，简，跟我一起去散散步吧。”

“我去叫黛安娜和玛丽。”

“不，今天上午我只要你一个人做伴。穿上衣服，穿过厨房，沿着通往沼泽谷源头的路前行，我会马上赶过来的。”

我不知道妥协的办法。在跟与我自己的性格相反的独断冷酷的人交往时，除了选择绝对服从和坚决反抗，现实生活中我不知道还有什么路可以选择。我往往忠实地倾向于前一种方法，有时终于到了忍无可忍、一触即发的地步，接着便转变成选择后一种方法了。既然目前的情况还不足以让我起来反抗，而我现在的心境又不想反抗，我便谨慎地服从了圣·约翰的吩咐。十分钟以后，我俩就并肩走在通往幽谷的小路上了。

微风从西面吹来，越过山冈，吹来了欧石楠和灯芯草扑鼻的芳香；天空湛蓝湛蓝的，没有一点云彩；溪水由于春雨的灌溉而撒了欢儿似的从山谷中飞流而下，碧波盈盈而清澈，借着太阳的金光和天空赋予它的蓝宝石光泽，别有一番情趣。我们往前走着，离开了小径，走在一块细如苔藓、青如绿宝石的软绵绵的草地上面，草地上零星地散落着一朵朵白色小花，一种星星似的黄花闪烁着艳丽的颜色装饰着这块草地。我们被周围的一座座小山包围住，蜿蜒的幽谷已到尽头，这里已是群山的中心。

“我们在这里休息一下吧。”当我们走到一个岩石群边上散乱的岩石跟前时，圣·约翰说。这个岩石群守卫着隘口，一条小溪从隘口的另一头飞流直下，形成了瀑布。再远一点的地方，山峦抖落了身上的绿草和花朵，只剩下欧石楠蔽体，岩石作点缀；在这里山把荒凉夸大成了蛮荒，用愁眉苦脸来代替精神饱满；在这里，山为孤寂守护着无望的希望，为静穆守护着最后的避难所。

我同意了他的提议，坐了下来，圣·约翰在我旁边站着。他抬头仰望群山，又低头鸟瞰山谷。他的目光游移不定，一会儿随着溪流的方向移动，一会儿又回过来扫视这给溪流上了彩的清澈的天空。他摘下帽子，尽情地让微风吹拂他的头发，亲吻他的额头。他似乎在与他经常来的这个地方的守护神恳谈，他此刻的眼神似乎在向某种东西告别。

“我会再见到它的，”他大声说道，“在梦里，当我睡在恒河旁边的时候。还有，在更遥远的时刻——当我再次沉睡过去的时候——在一条没有名气的小溪的岸边。”

多么离奇的爱，多么离奇的话：表达了一个简朴的爱国者对自己祖国的热情！他坐了下来，接下来的半小时里我们都没有说话，他不开口，我也不吱声。这段时间之后，他又开始说了：

“简，六周以后我就要离开了，我已经在‘东印度人’号船上订好了铺位，六月二十日起航。”

“上帝会保佑你的，因为你在为上帝工作。”我回答。

“是的，”他说，“我很高兴能为上帝工作，那是我的光荣。我是给一个永远都不会出错的主人当奴仆。我这次出门不用我们这些肉体凡胎的指导，也不用忍受残缺的法律的制约，也不用遭受我的软弱同类的错误领导的支配；我的国王，我的立法者，我的首领是尽善尽美的上帝。我感觉奇怪，我周围的人为什么不投到同一面旗帜下来——共同完成这项事业呢？”

“并不是所有人都像你那样有魄力。弱者希望跟强者同行是件愚蠢至极的事情。”

“我指的不是弱者，也没有想到他们。我只和那些适合做这种工作，并且有能力履行使命的人说话。”

“那种人很少，并且不容易发现。”

“你说的是事实。但是一旦发现，就应该去激励他们——督促和劝告他们做这一方面的努力——告诉他们自己的天赋是什么以及为什么上帝要把这些天赋赐予他们，应该把上帝的使命告诉他们，还应该直接从上帝那儿，给他一个在他的选民中的位置。”

“如果他们真的适合做这种工作，并且能胜任这种工作的话，他们的心灵不应该第一个得到反应吗？”

我觉得好像有一种可怕的魔力正在我周围形成并且在头顶聚集起来。我战栗着唯恐听到某些致命的话，这些致命话会立即在瞬间释放。

“那你的心能说些什么呢？”圣·约翰问。

“我的心是沉默的——沉默的。”我回答，我像被击中要害一样吓得毛骨悚然。

“那么我替它说吧。”他继续说，语调深沉、冷酷，“简，我们一起去印度吧，做我的妻子和助手吧。”

此刻峡谷和天空旋转起来，群山也翻腾起伏；我仿佛听到了上天的召唤——仿佛有个像马其顿那样的异象中的使者已经宣布：“过来帮助我们！”但我不是使徒，我看不见那位使者，也接受不到他的召唤。

“啊，圣·约翰！”我叫道，“可怜可怜我吧！”

我在向一个自以为在履行职责而不知道怜悯和同情别人的人请求。他继续说：

“让你做一名传教士的妻子是上帝和大自然的意旨。他们给予你的不是物质上的能力，而是精神上的才能。你是为工作而生，而不是为了爱情。你一定要做传教士的妻子——很快就要做。你将要属于我，我需要你——不是为了我个人享乐，而是为了服侍主。”

“我不适合，我没有这方面的才能。”我说。

他已经猜到我刚开始肯定会反对，因此他没有被我的话惹怒。的确，他倚在背后的一块岩石上，双臂交叉抱着放在胸前，脸色看起来很平静。我料到他早已经准备好对付长久烦人的反抗，而且积累了足够的耐心让自己坚持到底——下定决心以他对别人的征服而结束。

“简，谦虚，”他说，“是基督美德的根本。你说得没错，你不适合这一项工作。但是谁适合呢？或者，那些曾经真正受召唤的人，谁能相信自己是值得受召唤的呢？在我看来，不过是普通人而已，和圣·保罗相比，我承认自己是最大的罪人。但我不能忍受我个人可耻的罪恶感使自己畏缩不前。我知道我的领导者，正直并且强大，在选择一个微弱的器具来完成一项伟大的事业时，他的意志会借助上帝储藏的无穷的智慧，为达到目的而弥补方法上的不足。像我一样去想，简——像我一样去相信吧。我要你依靠的是不朽的磐石，别再疑惑了，它将承受你人性弱点的负荷。”

“我不了解传教士的生活，也从来没有研究过传教士的工作。”

“我也一样，我和你一样无知。只要你愿意，我可以给你一些必要的帮助。我可以一个小时一个小时地给你分配工作，可以常常站在你旁边，经常帮助你。这是我最初的时候能够做到的；工作不久——因为我知道你的工作能力——你就会像我一样强大，一样适合，也就不会再需要我的帮助了。”

“但是我的能力，证明我能承担起这项工作的能力在哪儿呢？我感觉不到它。刚才当你说话的时候，我自己感觉不到任何东西在我心里说话或活动。我感觉不到灯火在燃烧，感觉不到心脏在加剧跳动，也感觉不到有声音在劝诫和鼓励我。哦，但愿我能让你看到，我的心此刻像阴暗的地牢，地牢深处桎梏着一种犹豫不决的忧虑——那就是害怕自己被你说服，去尝试做我不能够完成的事情。”

“我告诉你答案——你听着。当我们第一次见面的时候，我就已经开始观察你了，我研究你已经十个月了。那个时候，我已经通过各种各样的实验，证明你有这个能力。我了解到了什么，发现了什么呢？在乡村学校里，我发现你能准时而正直地完成和你习性、心愿不相符的工作。我看到你能施展自己的才能和机灵智慧去完成它。当你能自我控制时，你就能取胜。你知道自己突然发财时很平静，我看到了一个毫无底马[1]恶习的明亮的心灵——钱财并不能支配你。你会毅然地把财富分成四份，自己只要一份，把其余的让给了有各种理由索要的其他三个人。我看到了一个因牺牲自己的激情而感到幸福的灵魂。从你一直坚持的孜孜不倦的精神中，从你对待困难那永不衰竭的活力和不可动摇的个性中，我看到了你具备我所寻求的一切品格。简，你温顺、勤奋、无私、忠诚、坚定和勇敢。你非常温和而且也很勇敢。别再不相信自己了——我可以无条件地信任你。你可以做印度学校的领导，去帮助印度妇女，你的帮助对我来说是无法估量的。”

罩在我头上的紧箍越来越紧。我正在被慢慢地、稳健地说服。我即将闭上眼睛，最后的几句话彻底成功地打通了原先似乎已堵塞的道路。我所做的工作看起来是那么模糊，零碎不堪，经他描述以后有了清晰的框架。他等候着我回答他。在我再次冒险回答他之前，我要求他给我一刻钟的时间思考。

“好。”他回答道。他站了起来，向隘口快走了一小段路，躺倒在一块隆起的欧石楠地上，静静地躺在那里。

“我必须认清并承认，如果生活已经放弃了我，我可以做他要我做的事，”我思索起来，“但我觉得在印度那么强烈的日光照射下，我肯定活不了多久。接下来会怎样呢？他又不关心我。我死的时候，他将会把我平静和神圣地交付给我生命的上帝。我现在的状况非常清晰。离开英国，就要离开一块我所热爱但无所挂念的地方——罗切斯特先生也不在英国。即使他在，和我有关系吗？现在我就是要在没有他的情况下继续生活下去。没有什么比这么日复一日地苟且偷生更可笑更软弱的了，在现实生活中，好像我在等待某些不可能发生的变化，从而再次把我和他联系在一起。当然——如圣·约翰曾说过的那样——我得在生活中寻找另一种有乐趣的事情，来替代那已经失去的。而他现在给我提供的工作，不正是我能接受的、上帝给我安排的最好的工作吗？通过他高尚的关心和崇高的结果来看，岂不最适合弥补破裂的情感和消逝的希望所留下的空缺吗？我认为我一定要说，是的——然而我浑身战栗。哎呀！要是我跟着他，我就抛弃了我自己个性中的一半。如果我去印度那就是过早地走向死亡。而离开英国到印度和离开印度到坟墓之间的间隔，又该怎样填补呢？噢，我很明白。为了竭力使圣·约翰满意，我会不停地工作下去，直到身体吃不消为止。我将要让他满意——做得尽善尽美不让他失望。要是我真的做出他需要的牺牲，那我会做彻底。我会把一切，包括我的心灵和肉体——都祭到圣坛上。他也会不再爱我，但他会同意我的做法。我会向他展现他没有见过的能力和他意料不到的才智。是的，我会像他那样努力工作，无怨无悔。

“那么就是同意了，但是除了一条，可怕的一条。那就是要我做他的妻子，而他那颗做丈夫的心，并不比峡谷中小溪流过以后能够泛起水泡的凹凸不平的巨石强多少。他重视我就像士兵对待一件好的武器，也就是这样。不嫁给他，这绝对不会令我感到悲伤。可是我能让他心满意足——冷静地实施他的计划——走进婚礼殿堂吗？我能从他那儿得到婚戒，接受到爱的一切形式（我相信他会小心翼翼地做到），我能承受他所给予的每一份爱只不过是他所做出的对原则的一种牺牲这种意识吗？不能，这样的殉情太畸形了。我绝不能忍受。作为他的妹妹，绝不是他的妻子来伴随着他，我这就告诉他。”

我朝隆起的石块方向望去，他躺在那，静静地像根倒地的柱子。他的脸庞朝向我，眼里闪着警惕和敏锐的光芒。他蓦地站起，朝我走来。

“如果我可以自由自在地去，我准备和你一起去印度。”

“你的回答需要解释一下，”他说，“我不清楚你的意思。”

“迄今为止，你在我心里一直都是我的表兄，而我是你的表妹，让我们维持这种关系不好吗？我想我们最好不要结婚。”

他摇了摇头。“表兄妹的亲属关系在这种情况下是行不通的。如果你是我的亲妹妹，那就不同了，我将会带着你，而不再寻找妻子。但是现在的情况是，我们的结合必须以婚姻的形式来神圣化和保证，否则我们就不可能结合。现实的情况不允许我们有别的打算。你难道不明白吗，简？好好想想吧——你坚强的意志会指引你。”

我确实考虑过了。我的理智像刚才一样引导我明白一个事实：我们之间不存在丈夫和妻子之间应该有的那种爱，因为我的理智做出的推论就是我们不应该结婚。于是我决定说出来。“圣·约翰，”我回答他，“我把你当做哥哥——你把我当做妹妹，就让我们继续保持这种关系吧。”

“不可能——不可能，”他简短、急速、决然地回答，“这不行。你已经说过要和我一起去印度。记住——你说过这句话。”

“我去是有条件的。”

“好了——好了。在重要的问题上——和我一块儿离开英国，在我未来的工作中与我协作——你没有异议。你已经等于把你的手放在犁头上了，你不能说话不算数，别再收回你所说的话。你只能想着一个目标——怎样把你要做的工作做得最好，简化你那些复杂的兴趣、情感、想法、愿望和目标，把一切因素都汇成一个共同目标，那就是：竭尽全力，高效地完成主赐予你的伟大使命。要实现这个目标，你必须有个助手——不是一个哥哥，那样太散漫，而是一个丈夫。我也一样，不需要一个妹妹。妹妹任何时候都可以从我身边走开。我要的是妻子，我生活中能施予有效影响的唯一帮手，能够伴我一生的妻子。”

他说这话的时候我战栗着。我觉得他的影响浸入我的骨髓——他束缚了我的手脚。

“别在我身上浪费精力了，到其他地方另找一个吧，圣·约翰，找一个适合你的。”

“你的意思是一个适合我目标的——适合我职业的人。我再告诉你一遍，并不是要作为微不足道的个人——一个仅仅带有自私观念的男人，而是作为一个传教士，我希望。”

“我将把我的精力献给传教士——他所需要的就是这个——而不是我本人。我对于他来说，只不过是把果壳加到果仁上，对他来说，果壳一类的东西并没有什么作用：我要留着它们。”

“你不能——也不应该。你想上帝会接受一半祭品吗？他会接受不完整的牺牲吗？我拥护的是上帝的事业，我要按照上帝的标准把你招募到他的麾下。我不能代表上帝来接受你的部分忠诚，一定要毫不保留。”

“哦！我会把我的心交给上帝的，”我说，“但是你不需要它。”

读者啊，我不能发誓我说出这句话时的语气和伴随着的感情里，没有一点被压抑的讽刺。直到现在，我从内心深处害怕圣·约翰，因为我不完全了解他。他让我感到敬畏，因为我总是猜不透他。他有多少属于圣人，多少属于凡人，我一直说不出来。但从这次交谈中我得到了启示，在我眼皮底下我对他的本性进行了剖析。我看到了他的错误，并能够理解他的这些错误。坐在欧石楠岸边，看着前面那个漂亮的身躯时，我明白我是坐在一个与我一样有缺点的男人跟前。面纱从他冷酷和专横的面孔上落下。一旦觉得他身上有这些品质，我便感到他并非那么完美，因而鼓起了勇气。我和一位平等的人在一起——我可以和他争论——如果认为合理，还可以反驳。

我说完最后一句话的时候，他沉默了。我立刻大胆地抬头去看他的面容。他的眼睛看着我，既惊讶又表达了急切的探询之情。“她可在嘲笑我？是嘲笑我吗？”这目光好像在说，“这是什么意思呢？”

“我们不要忘了这是一件严肃的事情，”过了一会儿他说，“这不是一件我们可以轻率谈论或思考而不犯罪的事情。简，我相信当你说要全心全意为上帝服务的时候，你是真诚的。这就是我想要的全部。一旦你把心从人体掏出来，把它固定在你的创造者身上，那么推进上帝的精神王国在现实生活中出现会成为你的乐趣和毕生的事业。只要能推进这一目标，你都会马上准备去做。你将会看到我们身体和精神上的结合，将会对你我的付出产生多大的促进作用！只有这种结合才能给人类的命运和设想以永久一致的特性。而且只要你摆脱一切琐细的任性——克服感情上的一切细小障碍和娇气——放弃考虑个人爱好的程度、种类、力量和柔情——你就会立刻急于要达成这种结合。”

“我会吗？”我简短地说。我看着他的脸，漂亮匀称，但却呆板严肃得可怕；他的额头，威严却不舒展；他的眼睛，明亮、深沉、锐利，却不温柔；看着他那高高的、威严的身躯。我在心里默默地把自己设想为他的妻子。不，这绝对不可能。当他的副牧师，做他的助手，这都没有问题。我愿意以那样的身份和他一起漂洋过海，和他一起在日光下劳作；敬佩和仿效他的勇气、虔诚与活力，默默地接受他领导者的身份，心平气和地嘲笑他不可动摇的雄心；区分教徒与平常人，尊重前者，而宽恕后者。毫无疑问，以这样的身份依附他，会使我常常感到痛苦。我的肉体将会被置于紧紧的枷锁之中，但至少我的心灵和思想却是自由的。孤独的时候，我可以求助于不曾枯萎的自我，与未受奴役的感情交流。那样我的心中有一块属于我的角落，情感在那里发展，新鲜而隐蔽，他永远无法触及。他的严酷无法使它凋落，他那勇士般的整齐步伐也无法践踏它。但是做他的妻子，就得永远在他身边，永远被他束缚，永远需要克制；天性之火压得很小，它只能在内心燃烧，永远不能喊出声来，被禁锢的火焰把我的五脏六腑一个接一个地烧毁，这令人难以忍受。

“圣·约翰！”想到这儿，我叫了出来。

“嗯？”他冷冷地回答。

“我重复一遍，我完全同意和你一起去印度做你的助手，但是不是作为妻子；我不能和你结婚，不能够成为你的一部分。”

“你必须成为我的一部分，”他沉着地回答，“不然整个事情只是一句空话。除非你跟我结婚，不然我一个快三十岁的男人就这么带着一个十九岁的小姑娘去印度了？除非她嫁给我。我们不结婚怎么能始终待在一起呢——有时候是单独相处，有时候与野蛮种族相处？”

“很好，”我简洁地说，“既然这样，那还不如把我当成你的亲妹妹，或者把我当成一个像你一样的男人或牧师。”

“你不是我的亲妹妹，这是众所周知的。我不能向别人那么介绍你，要是那么做，只会引来人家对我们俩有害的猜疑。至于其他，尽管你有着男子般活跃的头脑，却有一颗女人的心，这不行。”

“可以，”我带有几分不屑地肯定说，“完全可以。我有一颗女人的心，但这颗心与你关心的没有关系。对你，我只有同伴的坚贞，战友之间的坦率、忠诚和友谊。如果你愿意，那就还有新的传教士对牧师的尊敬；请放心，除此之外，再也没有别的感情了。”

“这就是我所需要的，”他自言自语地说，“我正需要这个。道路上障碍重重，必须一一排除。简，跟我结婚你不会后悔的，肯定不会。我们必须结婚，我再说一句，别无其他选择。毫无疑问，结婚以后，自然会产生爱情，到那个时候，连你都会觉得这种结合是很正确的。”

“我不屑于你的爱情观。”我不由自主地说，一面站起来，背靠岩石站在他面前，“我也看不起你的虚情假意，是的，圣·约翰，你那么做的时候，我就瞧不起你了。”

他一面目不转睛地盯着我，一面紧抿着有棱角的嘴唇。他究竟是被激怒了，还是感到吃惊或是其他什么，很难说清楚。他很善于掩饰自己的情感。

“我从来没想到会从你口中听到那样的表述，”他说，“我认为我并没有做过和说过什么让别人瞧不起的事情。”

我被他温和的语调所打动，也被他傲慢镇定的神态所震慑。

“原谅我刚才的话吧，圣·约翰。不过这也怨你，你把我逼急了我才那么口无遮拦的。你谈起了一个我们俩天生就意见相左的话题——一个我们绝不应该讨论的话题。爱情这两个字本身就会引起我们之间无休止的争论，要是从实际出发，我们该怎么办呢？我们该怎么感觉？亲爱的表兄，放弃你那套结婚计划吧，放弃它。”

“不，”他说，“这是一个考虑很长时间的计划，而且是唯一能使我实现我伟大目标的计划。不过现在我不想再劝你了。明天我要到剑桥去，与我在那里的朋友们告别。我大约要在外面待两周——利用这段时间好好考虑一下我的建议吧。别忘了，要是你的答案是否定的话，你舍弃的不是我，而是上帝。上帝通过我为你提供了高尚的职业，而只有做我的妻子，你才能从事这项职业。拒绝做我的妻子，你就会把自己永远局限在自私闲适和无所事事的小道上。恐怕在这种情况下，你就要被列入抛弃信仰的人当中去，而且比不信教者更糟！”

他说完从我那儿走开，说：





“眺望小溪，眺望山坡。”





但这时候他把自己的感情全都放在心里。我已经没有资格听他宣泄。当我们一起回家的时候，从他的沉默中，我清楚地知道他对我的感觉。那是严厉、专制的个性，在预料对方能俯首帖耳的情形下、却遭到了反抗时的失望——一种冷静固执的判断力发现自己不能同意的感情与见解时的不满。总之，作为一个男人，他原希望逼迫我就范，而只是因为他是一位虔诚的基督教徒，才这么耐心地忍住了我的执拗，给我那么长时间思考和忏悔。

那天晚上，他吻过他的妹妹们告别后，认为最好是忘记和我握手，于是默默离开了房间。我被他这种有意的忘记伤害了，尽管我对他没有爱情，却有着非常深厚的友谊。我心里很难受，眼睛里噙着泪水。

“我看得出来，你们在荒原上散步时，你和圣·约翰吵过了，简。”黛安娜说，“可是，去追他吧，他在过道里徘徊，他正盼着你去呢，他会和你和好的。”

这种情况下我没有太多的自尊。与其保持尊严，还不如保持心境愉快，我跟在他后面跑过去——他在楼梯跟前站住了。

“晚安，圣·约翰。”我说。

“晚安，简。”他镇定地回答。

“握握手吧。”我加了一句。

他的手触碰我的手指时是那么松软，那么冷淡！看来他确实对今天的事情耿耿于怀。热诚已无法使他温暖，眼泪也不能打动他了。与他已不可能达成愉快的和解，他没有激励人的笑容，也没有慷慨大度的话语。可是这位基督徒依然保持耐心和平静。我问他是否愿意原谅我时，他说他没有记住这些小事的习惯；再说也没有什么好原谅的，因为我压根儿就没有冒犯他。

说着他便离开了我，我倒希望他把我一拳打倒在地上。

[1]底马，据《圣经·新约·提摩太后书》第4章第10节，底马贪爱现今的世界，离弃了基督耶稣的使徒保罗。





第三十五章


第二天，他并没有像他说的那样去剑桥，而是把行程推迟了整整一周。在这段时间内，他这样一个善良却苛刻、真诚却不宽容的人，让我感受了他让开罪他的人受到了多么严厉的惩罚。没有公开的敌视行为，没有一句责备的话，却让我能立刻相信，我已得不到他的欢心。

并不是说圣·约翰怀有非基督徒的报复之心——不是说他不会伤害我一分一毫，尽管他完全可以这样做。从本质和原则上来说，他超越了卑劣的报复；他已经原谅我轻蔑他，不屑于他的爱，但他永远也不会忘记那些话；只要我和他都活着，他就不会忘记。当他转向我的时候，我看见了他的表情，而那种表情是我和他之间经常有的；不管我什么时候说话，在他听来，我的嗓音里总有着这些话的味道，他给我的每个回答也回响着这些话的余音。

他并没有刻意躲避我，不和我说话，他甚至还像往常一样，每天早上把我叫到他的桌子旁边。我担心他心中的堕落者有一种秘而不宣、也不为纯洁的基督徒所欣赏的乐趣，表明他能多么巧妙地在一如既往的言论举动中，从每个行动和每句话里，抽掉某种曾使他的言语和风度产生严肃魅力的关心和赞许态度。对我来说，他已经不是雪融之躯，而是一尊塑像；他的眼睛像冷漠、明亮的蓝宝石；他的舌头是说话的工具，仅此而已。

这对我是一种折磨，一种细细的、慢慢的折磨。这种折磨保持着愤怒和悲痛的文火，让我感到难受，压得我喘不过气来。如果我成了他的妻子，这位没有经过太阳照射的好人，不吸取我的一滴血，良心上不会感到一丝罪恶感，也会很快把我杀死。当我试着取悦他的时候，还能感受到这一点。我的同情得不到响应；他不会感受到疏远的痛苦，也不渴望调和；虽然我的眼泪不止一次地滴落在书上，但这对他没产生任何影响，他的心就像石头或铁做的。然而，他对他的妹妹们比以前更殷勤了，好像他的冷漠不能让我感受到被排斥似的，他还要加上对比的作用；但我相信他所做的，不是出于恶意，只是出于原则。

在他离家的前一天晚上，我偶然看到他在花园里散步。看着他的身影，我想起这个眼下虽然与我有些隔阂、但曾经救过我性命的人，又是我的近亲，心里便感动得打算为我们曾经的友谊做最后一次努力。我走出门，向他走去，他倚着小门站着，我立刻开门见山地说：

“圣·约翰，我感到很不舒服，因为你还在生我的气。让我们成为朋友吧。”

“但愿我们是朋友。”他一面无动于衷地回答，一面仍然仰望着冉冉上升的月亮；刚才我朝他走去时，就已经在看了。

“不，圣·约翰。我们的友谊不像以前那样了，这一点你是知道的。”

“不一样了吗？这么说可就不对了。就我来说，我并没希望你倒霉，而是愿你一切都好。”

“圣·约翰先生，我相信你，因为我深信你不会希望任何人倒霉；不过我是你的亲戚，我希望能多得到一份爱，超过你施与一般陌路人的普遍之爱。”

“当然，”他说，“你的愿望很合情理，我也远不止把你当做陌生人看待。”

说这话的时候，他的语气是冷漠、平静的，真是够折磨人的。如果顾及自尊和恼怒的情绪的话，我会立即离开他的。但有另外一种感情比这种感情更强烈。我很敬重我表兄的才能和原则。他的友情对我很重要，失去它我会非常难过。我不能这么快就放弃重新获得友谊的机会。

“我们就这样分别了吗，圣·约翰？你就这么离开我去印度，连一句好听的话都不说？”

他这会儿已经不看月亮，而是把脸转向我。

“我去印度就是离开你吗，简？什么！你不去印度？”

“你说我不能去，除非我嫁给你。”

“你不和我结婚？你还坚持你以前的决定？”

读者呀，您可像我一样，知道这个冷酷的人能赋予他冰块一般的问题怎样的恐怖，知道他一动怒多么像雪崩，一不高兴多么像冻冰的海面突然迸裂吗？

“不，圣·约翰，我不会和你结婚的，我坚持自己的决定。”

崩裂的冰雪抖动着往下滑，但还没有塌下来。

“再说一遍，为什么拒绝我？”他问。

“刚才我回答过了，”我说，“因为你根本就不爱我；现在我回答，因为你几乎要恨我。如果我跟你结婚，你会要我的命，现在就快要我的命了。”

他的嘴唇和脸颊顿时变白了，而且是很白很白。

“我要你的命？我正在要你的命？你这些话很暴力，很矫情，不像是女人说的。它们暴露了一种不幸的大脑状态，是不可原谅的，应该受到斥责。但原谅同伴是人类的职责，哪怕原谅他七十七次也一样。”

这下子事情完全搞砸了。我原本希望从他的脑海里抹去以前不愉快的回忆，却不料在它坚韧的表面上打上了更深的印记，我已经把它烙到里面去了。

“现在你真的恨我了，”我说，“再继续安抚你已经没有用了，我知道我已把你变成了永久的敌人。”

这些话的确又带来了一些新麻烦，甚至比上一次还要糟糕，因为它触及了事实的真相。无血而苍白的嘴唇不停地颤抖，直到痉挛。我知道我已经点燃了他的愤怒，我很痛苦。

“你完全误会我的意思了，”我一把抓住他的手说，“我本无意让你痛苦或悲伤，真的，我不是有意的。”

他苦笑着——非常坚决地把手抽了回去。“我猜，现在你可以完全收回你的承诺，绝对不去印度了，是吗？”一阵相当长的静默之后，他说。

“不，我愿意去，不过是作为你的助手。”我回答。

接下来是一段长时间的沉默。我不知道在这段时间里他的本性与理性之间会经历怎样的斗争；只见他的眼睛里闪着火花，脸上掠过奇怪的阴影。最后，他还是开口了：

“我之前已经和你说过，你这样的年轻女人要和我这样的男人一起去旅行是很荒唐的事情。我想你不会再提这个计划了。但你还是提了，我为你感到悲哀。”

我打断了他。这种直截了当的责备反而给了我反击的勇气。“圣·约翰先生，你讲点道理好不好？你越来越不讲理了。你假装对我说的话很震惊；其实你根本就没这么吃惊，因为像你这么聪明的人，不可能那么迟钝或自负到误解我的意思。我再说一遍，如果你愿意，我愿意当你的副牧师，但永远不会是你的妻子。”

他的脸再次铁青、煞白；但像往常一样，他很好地控制住了自己的情绪，他的回答很有力也很镇静：

“一个副牧师，却不是我的妻子，这对我绝对不合适。那么看来，你是不能跟我去了。但如果你的建议很诚心，那我去镇上的时候可以跟一个已婚的教士说说，他的妻子需要一个助手。你有自己的财产，不必依赖教会的赞助，这样，你就不会因为失信和毁约而感到耻辱。”

读者们明白，我从来没有正式许诺过，也没有跟谁订下过约定。在这种场合，他的话说得太狠、太专横了。我回答：

“这件事情不存在什么耻辱，也不存在着失信和毁约。我丝毫没有义务去印度，尤其是和陌生人一起。如果和你一起去，我愿意冒这个险；作为妹妹，我崇拜你、信任你、爱你；但我很明白一点，不管去哪儿，和谁一块去，在那种环境下，我都不会活得太久。”

“哦，危险的是你自己。”他撅起嘴唇说。

“我是害怕。上帝给了我生命不是让我随便舍弃的；如果按你的意愿去做，这无异于自杀。况且，在我决定离开英国之前，还要弄明白，留下是不是比离开更有价值。”

“你这是什么意思？”

“解释也是徒劳的，在这一点上我长期忍受着痛苦的疑虑，除非通过某种办法来解除疑团，否则我什么地方也不能去。”

“我知道你的心里在想些什么，在依恋着什么。你所拥有的疑虑是非法的、不神圣的。你早该将它抛弃。这会儿你应当为提起它而感到羞愧。你是不是还想着罗切斯特先生？”

事实就是如此，我默认了。

“你要去找罗切斯特先生吗？”

“我想知道他现在怎么样了。”

“那么，”他说，“就让我在祷告中记住你，真诚地祈求上帝不让你真的成为弃儿。我想我已认为你是主的选民了。不过上帝的眼光跟人的不一样，他的才真正起作用。”

他推开门，穿过它，溜达着到峡谷去了，很快就不见踪影。

我再次进入客厅的时候，发觉黛安娜伫立在窗边，一副若有所思的样子。我走近她，她个子比我高得多，她把手搭在我肩上，俯身端详起我的脸来。

“简，你现在看起来很焦虑，脸色很苍白，”她说，“我想一定发生了什么事情。告诉我刚才在你和圣·约翰之间发生了什么事情；我一直从窗户里观察了你们半个小时，你得原谅我偷窥你们；但看了这么长时间，我都没有看明白，圣·约翰是一个怪人……”

她停了一会儿，见我没说话，就继续说道：

“我那位哥哥对你有一些奇特的想法，我想他对你关注很长时间了，他对其他人从来不这样。我想他是爱上你了，简，对吗？”

我把她冰冷的手放在我发烫的额头上，对她说：“不会，到死都不会。”

“那他的眼神为什么总是在你身上，那他为什么总是找机会和你独处，而且一直把你留在身边？我和玛丽都断言他肯定让你嫁给他。”

“他确实这样做了，他向我求婚了。”

黛安娜拍手叫好：“这正是我们所想所盼的！你会嫁给他的，简，是吗？那样他就会留在英国了。”

“才不是你想的那样呢，黛安娜。他向我求婚的目的是为他在印度的苦役中找个合适的伙伴。”

“什么！他希望你跟他去印度？”

“是的。”

“他简直疯了！”她嚷了起来，“我敢肯定，你到了印度肯定活不过三个月。简，你不会去的，你没有答应他，是不是？”

“我已经拒绝嫁给他——”

“结果他不高兴了？”她提醒说。

“很不高兴，我担心他永远不会原谅我。不过我提出以他妹妹的身份陪他去。”

“简，你要这样做可就傻到了极点。想想你要从事的工作，不停地劳作甚至连强壮的人都吃不消，更何况是柔弱的你。圣·约翰，你知道，他会强迫你干一些不可能的事情；跟他在一起，大热天也不会有时间休息；但不幸的是，我注意到，凡是他强求的，你都努力去完成。听到你有勇气拒绝做他的助手，我真的很惊讶。这么说，简，你不爱他了？”

“那种爱不是对丈夫的爱。”

“不过他是个很英俊的家伙。”

“而我又长得那么平庸，你知道，黛安娜。我们不般配。”

“平庸！你吗？绝对不是。你太漂亮，也太好了，不能活活地放到加尔各答去烤。”她再次真诚地恳求我放弃与她兄长一起出国的念头。

“说真的，我得这样，”我说，“因为刚才我再次提出愿意做他的副牧师时，他对我的不恭表示惊奇。他好像认为提议不结婚陪他去有失体统，仿佛我一开始就不希望把他当成兄长，而且一直这么看他似的。”

“你为什么说他不爱你呢，简？”

“你应该听听他对这个问题的看法。他一次又一次地解释说他结婚不是为了自己，是他的工作需要他结婚。他还曾经告诉我，说我生来是为了劳作，而不是为了爱；毫无疑问，这有一定道理。但依我看来，如果我生来不是为了爱，那我生来就注定不会结婚。黛安娜，难道一辈子和一个只把你当工具的人拴在一起，这不是咄咄怪事吗？”

“不能容忍，不通人情，根本不可能！”

“虽然现在我对他只有兄妹感情，但如果被迫做了他的妻子，我想也会产生一种不可避免、陌生而又让人痛苦的爱，因为他是如此有才华，他的外表、风度以及谈吐常常有一种英雄的壮美。在那种情况下，我的命运就会有说不出的悲惨。他将不会再要我爱他。要是我依然有所表露，他会让我感到，那是多余的，他既不需要，对我也不合适。我知道他会这样。”

“可圣·约翰是个好人。”黛安娜说。

“他是一个好人，同时也是一个了不起的人；但他忘记了小人物在追求大目标时的感情和要求。因此，微不足道的人还是离他远一点好，免得在他前进时被踩在脚下。他回来了！我得离开了，黛安娜。”我慌忙上楼的时候，看见他进了花园。

晚饭的时候，我不得不再次面对他。他表现得和往常一样；我想他一定不会和我说话了，并且他也一定已经放弃要和我结婚的计划。但接下来的事情证明我这两点都想错了。他还是像以前那样和我说话；毫无疑问，他已经寻求了圣灵的力量，来压制被我激起的愤怒，并且相信他已经再次原谅了我。

祷告前的夜读，他选了《启示录》的第二十一章。倾听《圣经》中的话从他嘴里念出来始终是一种享受。在发表上帝的圣谕时，他优美的嗓子是最洪亮、最动听的，他的态度高尚纯朴令人难忘。而今天晚上，他的语调更加严肃——他的态度更富有令人震颤的含意——他坐在围成一圈的家人中间（五月的月亮透过没有拉上窗帘的窗子，泻进室内，使桌上的烛光显得几乎是多余的）。他坐在那里，低头看着伟大而古老的《圣经》，描绘着书页中的新天堂和新世界的幻境——告诉大家上帝如何会来到世间与人同住，如何会抹去人们的眼泪，并允诺不会再有死亡，也不会有忧愁和哭泣，不会有痛苦，因为这些往事都已一去不复返了。

接下来的一番话，他讲得让我出奇的激动，尤其是从他声音中难以描述的细小变化，我感觉到，他在说这些话的时候，目光已经转向了我。

“得胜的，必承载这些伟业；我要做他的上帝，他要做我的子民。”这段话读得又慢又清楚，“唯有胆怯的，持有异议的……将葬身于烧着硫黄的火湖里，这是第二次的死。”

此后，我知道圣·约翰担心什么命运会落在我头上。

他在朗读那一章最后几句壮丽的诗句时，露出一种平静而克制的得意之情，混杂着热切的渴望。这位朗读者相信，他的名字已经写在羔羊生命册上了；他盼望着允许他进城的时刻，地上的君王已将自己的荣耀归于那座城市。那城市不需要太阳、月亮的光照，因为有上帝光辉的永恒照耀和上帝的羔羊自己的光明，这已足够。

在这章之后的祈祷中，他调动了全身的活力——他那一本正经的热情又复苏了，他虔诚地向上帝祈祷，决心要取胜。他祈求给弱者以力量，给脱离羊栏的迷途羔羊指明方向，让那些受世俗生活和情欲诱惑而离开正道者在关键时刻迷途而知返。他请求，他敦促，他要求上天开恩，让他们免于火烙。真诚永远是庄严的。开始，我听着祈祷的时候，对他的真诚心存疑惑；接着，祈祷继续进行而且声音越来越响，我被打动了，最后终于产生了敬畏之心。他真诚地感到他目的的伟大与高尚，那些听他为此祈祷的人也不能不产生同感。

祷告结束以后，我们都和他告别，因为他第二天一早就要离开。黛安娜和玛丽吻过他之后离开了房间，我想肯定是他给了她们某些暗示；我伸出手去，祝他旅途愉快。

“谢谢你，简。我说过，两周后我会从剑桥回来，你利用这段时间好好考虑一下。如果我听从人的自尊，我就不会再说要你和我结婚这种话；但我必须听从我的职责，把它作为我的第一个目标，做什么事情都是为了上帝的荣耀。我的主长期受苦受难，我也会这样。我不能让你永堕地狱，变成受上天谴责的人。趁你还没有堕落的时候忏悔吧——下决心吧。记住，我们受到吩咐：要趁白天工作——我们还受到警告：‘黑夜将到，就没有人能做工了。’记住那些今世享福的财主的命运。上帝使你有力量选择好的福分，这福分是不能从你那儿夺走的。”

他说最后几个字时把手放在我头上，话说得很诚恳，也很委婉。说真的，他用的不是一个情人看女友的眼神，而是牧师召回迷途羔羊的目光——更好听点，是一个守护神注视着受他监护的灵魂的目光。一切有才能的人，无论有无感情，无论是狂热者还是追求者，抑或暴君，只要诚恳，在征服和统治期间都有令人崇敬的时刻。我崇敬圣·约翰——那么强烈，结果所产生的冲击力一下子把我推到了我久久回避的那一点上。我很想停止跟他搏斗——很想顺着他意志的洪流急速冲进他生活的海峡，把我淹没。现在我被他所困扰，几乎就像当初我受到另一个人的不同方式的困扰一样，两次我都做了傻瓜；在当时让步会是原则上的错误，而现在让步就会犯判断的错误。所以，当我透过时间的平静介质，回头去看那危机时，我这么想。当初，我并没有意识到自己的愚蠢。

我一动不动地站着，受着圣师的触摸。我忘却了拒绝——克服了恐惧——停止了搏斗。不可能的事——我与圣·约翰的婚姻——很快要成为可能了。猛地一阵风过后，全都变了样。宗教在呼唤——天使在招手——上帝在指挥——生命被卷起，好像书卷——死亡之门打开了，露出了彼岸的永恒。后来，为了那里的安全和幸福，这里什么都可以立即牺牲。阴暗的房间里充满了幻象。

“你现在就能决定吗？”传教士问。问话的语调很温柔，他同样温柔地把我拉向他。啊，那么温柔！它比强迫要有力得多！我能抵御圣·约翰的愤怒，但面对他的和善，我便像芦苇一样柔顺了。但我始终很清楚，要是我现在让步，有一天我照样会对现在的顺从懊悔。他的本性并不会因为一小时的庄严祈祷而改变，只不过升华了一点。

“只要有把握，我就能决定，”我回答，“只要让我信服嫁给你是上帝的意志，那我现在就可以不顾一切地发誓嫁给你，不管以后会发生什么事情！”

“我的祈祷应验了！”圣·约翰激动地叫道。他放在我头上的手按得更紧了，仿佛我已经是他的了。他用胳膊搂住我，几乎像是爱着我（我说“几乎”，因为我曾感受过被爱的滋味。但是像他一样，我已把爱置之度外，想的只是职责）。我在疑云翻滚的内心同不明朗的态度斗争着。我诚恳地、深深地、热切地期望去做正确的事情，也只做正确的事情。“给我指点一下，给我指点一下吧！”我祈求上苍。我从来没有像现在这样激动。至于后来发生的事情是不是激动的结果，读者自可判断。

整座房子寂静无声。因为我相信，除了圣·约翰和我，所有的人都已经进入梦乡了。那一根蜡烛正在渐渐熄灭，月光洒满整个房间。我的心怦怦乱跳，我能听见它的搏动。突然一种难以言表的感觉袭来，我的心为之震颤，这种感觉立即涌向大脑和四肢，我的心也随之停止了跳动。这种感觉不像电击，但却像电击一样尖锐、古怪惊人。它作用于我的感官，仿佛它们在这之前的最活跃时刻也只不过处于麻木状态。而现在它们受到了召唤，被惊醒了。它们起来了，充满了期待，眼睛和耳朵等候着，而骨头上的肌肉在颤抖。

“你听到什么啦？你看见什么了？”圣·约翰问。我什么也没有看到，可是我听见一个声音在什么地方呼唤着我的名字——

“简！简！简！”随后什么也听不到了。

“啊，上帝呀！那是什么声音？”我喘息着。

我本该说：“这声音是从哪里来的？”因为它似乎不在房间里，也不在花园里；它不是来自空中，也不是来自地下，更不是来自头顶。我已经听到了这声音——从何而来，或者为何而来，那是永远无法知道的！而这是一个声音——一个熟悉、亲切、记忆犹新的声音——爱德华·费尔法克斯·罗切斯特的声音。这声音痛苦而悲哀，显得狂乱、怪异和急切。

“我来了！”我叫道。“等等我！啊，我来了！”我飞也似的走到门边，向走廊里窥视着，那时一片漆黑，我冲进花园，外面什么也没有。

“你在哪儿？”我喊道。

沼泽居另一边的山峦隐隐约约地回声过来：“你在哪儿？”我倾听着。风在冷杉中低吟着，一切只有荒原的孤独和午夜的沉寂。

“去你的迷信！”那幽灵黑魆魆地在门外紫杉木旁边出现时，我说道，“这不是你的骗局，也不是你的巫术，而是大自然的功劳。她苏醒了，虽然没有创造奇迹，却尽了最大努力。”

我挣脱了圣·约翰，因为他一直跟着我，想让我留下。轮到我做回我自己的时候了。我的力量在起作用，在发挥威力。我告诉他不要问我任何问题，希望他能离我远一点，我想一个人待一会儿，他接受了我的要求，立即走开了。只要下的命令有震慑力，别人总是听话的。我回到楼上的卧室，把自己锁在房里，跪了下来，以我的方式祈祷着；但这种方式不同于圣·约翰，它自有其效果，我似乎已进入一颗伟大的心灵，我的灵魂感激地冲出去来到他脚边。我从感恩中站起来，下定了决心，随后躺了下来，并不觉得害怕，却受到了启发，急切地盼望着第二天的到来。





第三十六章


白天到来了。拂晓时分我起床，忙了一两个小时来整理我的房间，抽屉和衣橱里的东西，整理成便于我打算短期离开的时候所需要的样子。与此同时，我听到圣·约翰从他的房间里走出来。他在我门口停下，我害怕他敲门，但是他没有敲，只是从门下面把一小片纸塞了进来。我拿起它，只见上面写着：





昨天晚上你离开太突然了。如果你再稍微多待一会儿，你就会把手放在耶稣的十字架和天使的桂冠上。当我两个星期以后回来的时候，我希望你能做一个明确的决定。在这期间，你要留神和祈祷，愿自己不受诱惑。我相信，灵是愿意的；但我也看到，肉是软弱的。我会时时为你祈祷。

诚挚的圣·约翰





“我的灵魂愿意去做任何正确的事情，”我心里回答，“我希望我的肉体也一样坚强，一旦明确上帝的意志，便有力量去实现它。无论如何，我的肉体是够坚强的，让我可以去探求——询问——摸索出路，驱散疑云，找到确然无疑的晴空。”

这是六月一日。早晨，满天阴云，凉气袭人，骤雨敲窗。我听见前门开了，圣·约翰走了出去。透过窗子，我看到他走过花园，踏上雾蒙蒙的荒原，朝惠特克劳斯方向走去，他将在那儿搭乘马车。

“几小时之后我会循着你的路线，表兄，”我想，“我也要去惠特克劳斯搭乘马车。在永远告别英国之前，我也有人要探望和问候。”

离早餐还有两个小时。这段时间我在房间里轻轻地走来走去，思忖着促成我眼前这番计划的奇事。我回忆着我当时所经历的内心感觉，我能回想起那种难以言说的怪异。我回想着我听到的声音，再次像以前那样徒劳地问：它究竟从何而来？这声音似乎来自我内心——而不是外部世界。我问道，难道这不过是一种神经质的印象——一种幻觉？我既无法想象，也并不相信。它更像是神灵的启示。这惊人的震感来势猛似地震，摇撼了保罗和西拉所在的监狱的地基，它打开了心灵的牢门，松开了锁链——把心灵从沉睡中唤醒，它呆呆地战栗着，倾听着。随后它发出三声大喊，冲击着我受惊的耳朵，钻进我震颤的心，穿透了我的心灵。心灵既不害怕，也没有震惊，而是欢喜雀跃，仿佛因为有幸不受沉重的躯体支配，作了一次成功的努力而十分高兴似的。

“用不了很多天，”我从沉思中回过神来，说，“我想了解一下他的情况，昨晚他的声音在呼唤我。寄信证明是一种毫无用处的做法，我要亲自去打听一下。”

早餐时，我告诉黛安娜和玛丽，我要出门一趟，至少需要四天。

“你自己去吗，简？”她们问。

“是的，去看看一位朋友或者打听一下他的消息，我已为他担心好久了。”

我心里非常清楚，她们肯定相信，除了她们我没有别的朋友。也确实如此，我以前经常这样说。但是她们天生的教养让她们没有做过多的评论。黛安娜问我身体是不是健康，是否能够去旅行，因为她说我看起来脸色很苍白。我告诉她我身体很健康，没有任何疾病，只是心里有些忧虑，也许过一会儿就会稍微好一点。

没有任何询问和推测，接下来的准备就容易多了。我曾经有一次向她们解释过，我现在也不清楚我的计划，她们就好心而聪明地同意了我的要求，让我保持沉默，给了我在同样情况下也会给她们的自由行动的权利。

我下午三点钟的时候离开了沼泽居，刚过四点，我便已经站在惠特克劳斯的路牌下，等待着马车把我带到遥远的桑菲尔德去。在荒山野路的寂静之中，我很远就听见了马车的声音，而且越来越近。一年前的夏天的夜晚，我就是从这个地方下了那辆马车。当时的我是多么孤单，多么没有希望而又多么漫无目的啊！我一招手马车便停了下来。我上了车——现在已不必为一个座位而倾其所有了。我再次踏上去桑菲尔德的路，真有信鸽飞回家园之感。

从这儿到桑菲尔德需要走三十六个小时。我幸好是下午从惠特克劳斯出发的，星期四一大早，马夫在路边的一家旅店停下来饮马。旅店坐落在绿色的树篱、宽阔的田野和低矮的放牧小山之中（与中北部莫尔顿严峻的荒原相比，这里的地形多么柔和，颜色何等苍翠），这番景色映入我眼帘，犹如一位一度熟悉的人的面容。不错，我了解这里景物的特点，我确信离目的地很近了。

“这儿离桑菲尔德庄园多远？”我问旅店喂马的人。

“翻过田野再走两英里就到了，小姐。”

“我的旅行就要结束了。”我暗自想到。我走出马车，付了车夫钱，让他帮忙照看行李，等我需要的时候就过来取；曙光照在旅店的招牌上，我看到了镀金的字母“罗切斯特纹章”，心便怦怦乱跳，原来我已来到我主人的地界。但转念一想，又心如止水了。

“也许你的主人在英吉利海峡的另一边。况且，就是他在你匆匆前往的桑菲尔德庄园，除了他还有谁在那里呢？他发了疯的妻子吗？可是你与她毫不相干。你不敢同他说话，也不敢去找他。你不要白费力气了——你还是别再往前走了。”冥冥中的监视者敦促道，“从旅店里的人那里探听一下消息吧，他们会提供你想知道的一切情况，会立刻解开你的疑团。去问问那个人，罗切斯特先生在不在家。”

这个建议很在理，可我却无法强迫自己这样做，因为我害怕别人的一声回答会打碎我的希望。在这个时候，延迟知道事情的真相就是延长希望。再说，我还想在星火的照耀下，重新看一看那座庄园呢。我面前还是那道台阶，还是那片田野，那天早晨我逃离桑菲尔德的时候，急急忙忙地穿过这片田野，什么都看不见，什么也听不见，仇恨的怒火一个劲地在后面追我，当时我就像疯了一样。我还没想好走哪一条路，就已置身于这片田野之中了。我走得多快呀，简直就是在跑啊！我多么希望一眼就看到熟悉的林子啊！我是以多么欣喜的心情迎接那一棵棵我熟悉的树，看到树丛间我熟悉的草地和小山坡啊！

树林终于出现在眼前，白嘴鸦黑压压聚集了一片，一片片响亮的鸦鸣划破了清晨的宁静。一种奇怪的喜悦激励着我，使我急匆匆地往前赶，穿过另一片田野——走过一条小径——看到了院墙——但后屋的下房、府楼本身以及白嘴鸦的巢穴，依然隐而不见。“我第一眼看到的应是庄园的正面，”我暗自决定，“那里雄伟醒目的城垛会立刻扑入眼帘；从那里我能认出我主人的那扇窗子。也许此刻他会伫立窗前，因为他起得很早。也许他这会儿正在果园里或者前面铺筑过的路上散步呢。要是能见他一面该多好！哪怕就一会儿也好！如果真见到了，我总不会发疯似的冲他奔过去吧。我不知道，我也不敢肯定。要是我冲上去了，那又怎么样？上帝保佑他！那又怎么样？让我回味一下他的目光所给予我的生命，又会伤害了谁呢？我真是在说梦话，说不定此刻人家正在比利牛斯山或者南部风平浪静的海面上观日出呢。”

我沿着果园的矮墙往前走，在拐角处转了弯，发现有一扇开向草地的门，门两边有两根石柱，顶上有两个石球。从石柱的后面，我可以偷偷地看一眼庄园的正面。我小心谨慎地探出头，想看一下他的窗子是否已经开启；从这个隐蔽的地方望去，城垛、窗子和府楼长长的正面，一览无余。

我这么观察着的时候，盘旋在我头顶的乌鸦们也许正俯视着我。我不知道它们在想什么，它们一定以为起初我十分小心和胆怯，但渐渐地我变得大胆而鲁莽了。我先是偷看，随后是久久盯着，再后来是离开我的护身符，不由自主地走进了草地，突然在庄园正面停下脚步，久久地盯着它。“起初为什么装模作样，唯唯诺诺？”乌鸦们也许会问，“而这会儿又为什么傻里傻气，不顾一切了？”

听我来解释一下吧，读者。

一位情人发现他的爱人睡在长满青苔的河岸上，他不希望惊醒她，只是想看一眼她那迷人的面容。他在草坪上蹑手蹑脚地走近她，小心翼翼地不弄出响声来。他停下脚步——以为她动了一下；于是他就往后退，千方百计不要让她看到。四周万籁俱寂，没有一点声响。他再次往前走，向她低下头。她的脸上盖着一层薄薄的纱。他揭开面纱，身子弯得更低了。这会儿他的眼睛期待着看到这个美人儿——热情、年轻和可爱的睡美人。他的第一眼多么急不可耐！但他两眼发呆了：他多么吃惊！他刚刚还不敢用手指碰一下，现在却这么突然、这么冲动地把那躯体抱在怀里！他大声呼叫着她的名字，放下抱着的包袱，死死地盯着她。他就这样紧紧抱着，大声呼喊着，因为他不再担心发出的任何声响和所做的任何动作会把她惊醒。他以为爱人睡得很甜，可他却发现她早已死去了。

我忐忑不安地朝庄园望去，映入我眼帘的是一片焦黑的废墟。

没有必要躲在门柱后面畏缩不前了，真的！没有必要偷偷地眺望房间的格子窗，而担心窗后会有动静！没有必要倾听打开房门的声音，也没有必要想象铺筑过的路和砂石小径上的脚步声了！因为草地和庭院已经被踏得稀烂，呈现出一片荒芜的景象。正门敞开着，就像我梦里见到的那样，只剩下一堵贝壳似的断壁，高大而又单薄。只见那断壁上布满了没有玻璃的窗洞。没有屋顶，没有城垛，没有烟囱，所有东西都倒塌了。

这里有的只是死一般的寂静和荒野一般的凄凉。怪不得给这儿的人写信就像把信寄到教堂过道中的墓穴里一样收不到回信呢。黑森森的石头告诉我庄园是毁于一场大火，但火是怎么着起来的？这场灾难后面到底发生了什么事情？除了灰浆、大理石和木制品，还有什么其他损失？人是不是也都像财产一样消失了？如果是的话，谁去世了？这个令人心惊胆战的问题，这儿没有人可以回答，沉默的迹象、无言的标志都不能回答。

我徘徊在残垣断壁之间，在被毁坏的房子里面搜寻着；我发现这场火灾并不是最近发生的。我想冬天的雪曾经飘落在空空的拱门中，冬天的雨打在没有玻璃的窗户上。在一堆堆湿透了的废墟中，春天催醒了绿色；草和种子在石缝中、倒塌的木椽中发芽。唉，这片废墟的主人在哪里？在什么地方？是否平安？我的目光不由自主地飘向了大门边灰色的教堂塔楼，我问自己：“难道他已随戴默尔·德·罗切斯特而去，和他一起住在狭窄的大理石房子里了吗？”

我必须知道这些问题的答案。我在附近找不到任何人，我只能去之前去过的那个酒馆打听。于是不久我就重新回到了那里。老板亲自把早餐端到客厅里来，我请他关了门，坐下来，因为我有些问题要问他。但征得他的同意之后，我却不知道从何开始了。我对可能得到的回答怀着一种恐惧感，然而刚才看到的那番荒凉景象，为一个悲惨的故事做好了一定的准备。老板看上去是一位和蔼可亲的中年人。

“那你一定知道桑菲尔德庄园了？”我终于开口问了。

“是的，小姐，我以前在那里住过。”

“是吗？”我想肯定不是我在那儿的时候，因为我好像从来没见过他。

“我是已故罗切斯特先生的管家。”他补充道。

已故？我觉得我避之不及的事情，现在它似乎重重地给了我一下。

“已故？”我透不过气来了。“他死了吗？”

“我说的是现在的主人——爱德华先生的父亲。”他解释说。我又喘过气来了，我的血液继续流动。他的这番话使我确信，爱德华先生——我的罗切斯特先生（无论他在何方，愿上帝保佑他！）至少还活着，总之还是“现在的主人”。多让人高兴的话！我似乎觉得，不管他透露什么消息，我会比较平静地去倾听。我想，就是知道他在新西兰或澳大利亚，我都能忍受。

“罗切斯特先生现在还住在桑菲尔德庄园吗？”我问，我当然知道能得到什么样的答复，但并不想马上就直截了当地问他确切的住处。

“不，小姐——哦，不！那儿已经没有人住了。我想你是个外乡人吧，要不然你怎么不知道去年秋天发生的事情呢？桑菲尔德庄园几乎全毁了，是由收获季节的一场大火引起的。多可怕的一场灾难哪！那么多值钱的财产都毁掉了，几乎没有一件家具幸免。大火发生在深夜，当救火车从米尔科特赶来的时候，庄园已经是一片火海了。这景象真可怕，我是亲眼见到的。”

“深夜！”我小声说着。是呀，在桑菲尔德府那是致命的时刻。“你知道火是怎么引起的吗？”我问。

“他们猜想，小姐，他们是这么猜想的，其实，我该说那是确然无疑的。你也许不知道吧，”他往下说，把椅子朝桌子稍稍挪了挪，声音放得很低，“庄园里关着一位太太，是一个疯子。”

“我略有所闻。”

“小姐，她被严密地看管着，好多年了，人们几乎都不知道她的存在。从来没有人见过她，只是传说庄园里有这么一个女人。但她究竟是谁、干什么的，却很难想象。有人说她是爱德华先生从国外带回来的，也有人说她是爱德华先生的情妇。但一年前发生了一件奇怪的事情，一件非常奇怪的事情。”

我担心这会儿要轮到我自己的故事了。我努力地把他拉回我关心的问题上。

“这位太太呢？”

“小姐，这位太太，”他回答，“原来就是罗切斯特先生的妻子！这件事情发现的过程也很奇怪。以前庄园里来了一位年轻的女家庭教师，罗切斯特先生与她相爱了——”

“火灾呢？”我提醒。

“小姐，我就要谈到了。爱德华先生爱上了这位女家庭教师。听仆人们说，他们从来没见过他这么爱过谁，他一直在不停地追求她。过去他们总观察他，他爱慕她，胜过任何人。而实际上，除了他，没有人觉得那位女教师漂亮。他们说，她是那么弱小，差不多像个孩子。不过我本人从来没见过她，但我听女仆莉娅说起过她。莉娅很喜欢她。罗切斯特先生大约四十岁了，而那位女教师还不到二十岁；我想你也明白，他这个年龄的男子一旦爱上小姑娘，就会被迷得神魂颠倒。他要跟她结婚。”

“这部分故事等改天你再告诉我吧，”我说，“我现在特别想听你说说大火的事儿。是不是怀疑这个疯子，也就是罗切斯特太太干的？”

“你说对了，小姐。肯定是她，除了她，没有谁会放火。侍奉这个女人的女仆是一位叫普尔的太太，在她们那个行业里很能干，也很可靠。但像她们那个行业的人，都有一个毛病，就是爱喝酒。她私自留了一瓶松子酒，而且还时不时喝上几口。不过这也情有可原，毕竟照看疯子确实是件苦差事；但干这种差事，喝酒也很危险。当普尔太太喝完酒大睡的时候，那个狡猾而恶毒的疯女人从她的口袋里偷出钥匙，溜出看护室，在整个庄园里游荡，头脑一热什么事情都能干得出来。他们说她有一次差点把她的丈夫烧死在床上，但我不清楚这件事情。但是，那天晚上，她先是放火点燃了隔壁房间的帷幔，随后下了一层楼，走到原来那位女家庭教师的房间——不知怎么搞的，她似乎知道一切事情的进展，而且对她怀恨在心——放火烧了她的床，幸好睡在那儿的人两个月之前就走了。罗切斯特先生像丢了什么宝贝似的发疯地找她，但没有得到一点消息。罗切斯特先生的脾气因为失望变得越来越暴躁。他从来就不是一个性情温和的人，而失去她以后，简直就更危险了。他把费尔法克斯太太，就是他的管家，送到她远方的朋友那儿，还慷慨付给她一笔终身年金；她是受之无愧的，她是一个很好的管家。他把阿德拉小姐送进了学校，并与所有绅士断绝了来往，自己像隐士一样住在庄园里，很少出来走动。”

“什么？难道他没有离开英国？”

“离开英国？哎呀，没有！他不愿意跨出房门半步。除了夜里，他会像幽灵一样在庭院和果园里游荡，仿佛精神错乱似的，依我看是这么回事。他败在那位小女教师手里之前，小姐，你从来没见过哪位先生像他那么活跃，那么大胆，那么勇敢。他不像有些人那样热衷于饮酒、玩牌和赛马，他也不怎么漂亮，但他有着男人特有的勇气和意志。你瞧，他还是一个孩子的时候我就认识他了；至于我，但愿那位爱小姐还没到桑菲尔德庄园就沉到海底去了。”

“那么，起火时罗切斯特先生是在家里了？”

“不错，他确实在家。上上下下都烧起来的时候，他上了阁楼，把仆人们从床上叫醒，亲自帮助他们下楼——随后又返回去，把他发疯的妻子救出。那时他们喊他，说她在屋顶。她站在城垛上挥动着胳膊，大喊大叫，一英里外都听得见。我亲眼见了她，亲耳听到了她的声音。她个儿很大，头发又长又黑，站着时我们看到她的头发映着火光在飘动。我亲眼看到，还有好几个人也看到了罗切斯特先生穿过天窗爬上了屋顶。我们听他叫了声‘贝莎！’我们见他朝她走去，随后，小姐，她大叫一声，纵身跳了下去，刹那之间，她已躺在路上，摔得粉身碎骨。”

“死了？”

“死了！哦，完全断气了，在石头上摔得脑浆迸裂，鲜血四溅。”

“天哪！”

“你完全可以这么说，小姐，真吓人哪！”他打了个寒战。

“那么后来呢？”我催促着。

“哎呀，小姐，后来整座房子都夷为平地了，眼下矗立的只有断壁了。”

“还有其他伤亡吗？”

“没有——要是有的话，也许会更好些。”

“你这话是什么意思？”

“可怜的爱德华，”他失声叫道，“我从来没有想到会见到这样的事情！有人说那不过是对他隐瞒第一次婚姻并且妻子活着还想再娶的报应。但我认为，他是值得同情的。”

“你说他还活着？”我叫道。

“是啊，是啊，他还活着。但很多人认为他不如死了的好。”

“为什么？怎么会呢？”我的血又冰冷了，“他在哪儿？”我问，“在英国吗？”

“对——对——他是在英国，他没有办法走出英国了，我想——现在他是寸步难行了。”

那是什么病痛呀？这人似乎决意吞吞吐吐。

“他全瞎了。”他终于说，“是的，他全瞎了，爱德华先生全瞎了。”

我本来担心更坏的结局，担心他疯了。我又鼓足勇气，问他造成灾难的原因是什么。

“因为他的胆量，你也可以说，因为他的善良，小姐。他要等所有人逃出去之后才肯离开房子。罗切斯特太太跳下城垛后，他终于走下了那个大楼梯；就在这时，轰隆一声，整座宅子全塌了下来。他从废墟底下被拖了出来，虽然还活着，但伤势严重。一根梁坍塌了，正好护住了他一部分。不过他的一只眼球被砸了出来，一只手被压烂了，卡特医生不得不立刻将它截了下来。另一只眼睛发炎了，也失去了视力。如今他又瞎又残，真是无依无靠了。”

“他在哪儿？他现在住在什么地方？”

“芬丁庄园，他的另一个庄园里，离这里三十英里，是个很荒凉的地方。”

“谁跟他在一起？”

“老约翰和他的妻子。别人他都不要。他们说，他彻底垮了。”

“你有车吗，什么样的都行？”

“我们有一辆轻便马车，小姐，一辆很好看的车。”

“马上把车准备好。要是你那位马夫能在天黑前把我送到芬丁庄园，我会付给你和他比你们平时所要的多一倍的价钱。”





第三十七章


芬丁庄园是一幢相当古老的建筑物，中等面积，没有任何建筑风格，并且隐藏在森林深处。我以前听说过这座庄园，罗切斯特先生经常提到它，有时也会到这里来。罗切斯特先生的父亲为了打猎买下了这个地方，本来想把它租出去，可是由于位置偏僻和对身体有害，始终没有找到要租房子的人。芬丁庄园就一直很少有人居住，也没有陈列家具。只有两三个房间装修过，供罗切斯特先生的父亲打猎时用。

天黑之前，我来到了这座庄园。当时天空阴沉沉的，刮着寒冷的大风，又下着透骨的绵绵细雨。按照我的承诺，付了马夫两倍的路费把他打发走了，而剩下的最后一英里，我决定步行。即使在离这座庄园很近的地方，除了庄园周围枝繁叶茂、郁郁葱葱的树林，什么也看不到。两根花岗岩柱子之间的铁门告诉我入口在什么地方；穿过两根石柱，我立即发现自己进入了密林的昏暗当中。有一条杂草丛生的小径，沿着林荫小道而下，两旁是灰白多节的树干，顶上是枝丫交叉的拱门。我顺着这条路走去，以为很快就会到达住宅。谁知它不断往前延伸，蜿蜒曲折，看不见住宅或庭园的痕迹。

我想我走错了方向，迷了路。黑暗和树林里的薄雾向我袭来。我看了看四周，希望能找到另一条路。但除了缠绕交织的枝丫，圆柱似的树干，茂密的夏日绿叶，就没有其他的了。

我继续往前走。这条路终于有了出口，树林也稀疏些。我立刻看到了一排栏杆。随后是房子——在暗洞洞的光线中，依稀能把它与树木分开。颓败的墙壁阴湿碧绿。我进了一扇只是上了闩的门，站在围墙之内的一片空地上，那里的树木呈半圆形展开。没有花草，没有苗圃。只有一条宽阔的砂石路绕着一小片草地，藏于茂密的森林之中。房子的正面有两堵突出的山墙。窗子很窄，装有格子，正门也很窄小，一步就到了门口。正如“罗切斯特纹章”的老板所说，整个庄园显得“十分荒凉”，静得像周日的教堂。落在树叶上哗哗的雨声是附近能听到的唯一声音。

“这儿会有生命吗？”我暗自问道。

是的，这儿确实有某种有生命的东西；因为我听到了某种响声——不错，狭窄的正门打开了，一个人影刚要从房子里面出来。

门慢慢地打开，一个人影出现在暮色中。只见他站在台阶上，是个没带帽子的男人。他伸出手，好像要感觉一下天是否在下雨。尽管外面下着雾，我认出他了，他不是别人，他就是我的主人：爱德华·费尔法克斯·罗切斯特。

我停下脚步，屏住呼吸，一动不动地站在那儿看着他，仔细地看着他；可是他看不见我啊。这是一次突然的相遇，一次喜悦完全被痛苦所制约的会面。我很容易压住了我的嗓音，免得自己冒失地喊出声来；我也很轻松地控制了我的脚步，免得急乎乎地冲上前去。

他的身体还和以前一样强壮，腰背笔直，头发乌黑。他的五官没有任何变化也没有瘦。一年的时光，任何悲伤也休想销蚀他运动员般的力量，也休想摧毁他蓬勃的青春活力。但他的面部表情变化了，他看上去是那么绝望，那么郁郁寡欢；这让我想起了被虐待的动物或小鸟儿，在它绝望之际，走近它是很危险的。一只笼中的鹰，金色的双眼被残酷地剜去了，样子也许就像这位失明的参孙一样。

读者，你们认为，我会被他又恶又凶的脾气吓倒吗？要是你认为我怕，那你太不了解我了。伴随着哀痛，我心头浮起了温柔的愿望，我想冒险去吻一下他岩石般的额头和额头下冷峻的封闭的眼睑。但现在还不敢，我还不想招呼他。

他又下了一个台阶，慢慢摸索着朝那块草地走去。他原先的大步去哪儿了？接着他就停下了，好像他不知道该往哪条路上拐。他举起手，睁开眼睛，做了很大的努力，茫然地注视着一切，他伸出了右手（截了肢的左臂藏在胸前），似乎想通过它摸一摸周围的情况。但他碰到的依然是一片空虚，因为树木离他站着的地方有几码远。他只好作罢，抱着胳膊，静默地站在雨中，这会儿下大了的雨打在他光秃秃的头上。正在这时，约翰不知从哪里出来，走近他。

“扶着我的胳膊好吗，先生？”他说，“马上就要下大雨了，你还是回屋吧！”

“别管我。”他回答。

约翰走开了，没有注意到我。这时罗切斯特先生试着走动走动，却徒劳无功——他对周围的一切太没有把握了。他摸回自己的屋子，进去后关了门。

我走上前去敲门，约翰的妻子开了门。“玛丽，”我说，“你还好吗？”

她像见到鬼似的，很是惊恐。我设法让她镇静下来。“这么晚了到这样一个偏僻的地方来，真的是你吗，小姐？”我抓住她的手作为回答，然后跟她进了厨房。约翰正坐在火炉旁。我简短地向他们解释，我离开桑菲尔德以后发生的事情我都已经知道了，我是来看罗切斯特先生的。我让约翰到我下车的那个关卡去，把我留在那儿的箱子取来。我一边取下我的帽子和披巾，一边问玛丽我可不可以在这里住上一晚。我得知，要办到这一点虽然困难，但不是不可能，所以就告诉她，我要住下来。就在这时候，客厅的铃响了。

“你进去的时候，”我说，“告诉你主人，说有人想见他，但是不要提我的名字。”

“我想他不会见你，”她回答，“他谁都不想见。”

当玛丽回来的时候，我问他怎么回答的。“你要报上你的名字和你有什么事情才可以，不然他是不会见你的。”她回答。接着她又去倒了一杯水，拿了几根蜡烛，都放进托盘里。

“他按铃就是为了这个？”我问。

“是的，尽管他看不见，但天黑后总是让人把蜡烛拿进去。”

“把托盘给我吧，我拿进去。”

我从玛丽的手中接过托盘，她给我指了指客厅的门。当我接过它的时候，托盘一直在抖，水从玻璃杯中溅出，我的心又响又急地碰撞着我的肋骨。玛丽为我打开客厅的门，我进去之后，她又在后面把门关上了。

这个客厅看起来很阴暗。一小堆没人照看的火在炉子里燃烧着。只见有一个人头倚在高高的旧式壁炉架上，身子对着炉火，那人就是我那位瞎眼的主人。他的那条老狗派洛特则弯着身子躺在一边，离他远远的，生怕被他不经意踩着似的。我一进门，派洛特便竖起了耳朵，跳起来，随后叫了一通，便朝我奔过来，差点打翻了我手中的盘子。我把盘子放在桌上，拍了拍它，轻轻地说：“躺下！”罗切斯特先生机械地转过身来，想看看那骚动是怎么回事，但他什么也没看见，于是便回过头去，叹了口气。

“玛丽，把水给我。”他说。

我走近他，托盘里只盛着半杯子水。派洛特跟在我后面，很兴奋的样子。

“怎么了？”他问。

“躺下，派洛特！”我又说。他还没把水端到嘴边就停了下来，似乎在听。他喝了水，放下杯子。

“是你吗，玛丽？你是玛丽吗？”

“玛丽在厨房里。”我回答。

他伸出手，做了一个迅速的动作，但是他没看到我站在哪里，也没有摸着我。“你是谁？你是谁？”他追问着，好像要努力地用他那双失明的眼睛看清楚——无效而痛苦的尝试啊！“快回答我，再说话！”他命令道，既专横又大声。

“你还要再喝点水吗，先生？杯子里的水让我洒掉了一半。”我说。

“是谁？是什么？是谁在说话？”

“派洛特认得我，约翰和玛丽知道我在这里，我今天晚上才来到这里。”我回答。

“天哪！我产生了怎样的幻觉？什么甜蜜的疯狂控制了我？”

“不是幻想也不是疯狂。先生，你的头脑非常正常，不会陷入痴心梦想；你的身体十分强壮，不会发狂。”

“说话人在什么地方？不会只有一个声音吧？天啊，我虽然不能看到，但是我必须感觉到，否则我的心脏将会停止跳动，我的脑浆将会迸出。不管是什么东西，也不管是什么人，让我感觉一下，否则我会死掉的！”

他摸索着；我抓住他摸索的手，用双手紧握住它。

“是她的手指！”他叫道，“她细小而又修长的手指！如果是的话，就不止这一双手，一定还有其他部分。”

这只男人的手挣脱了我的束缚，我的胳膊被抓住了，我的肩膀、脖子、腰都被搂住了，紧紧地贴着他。

“是简吗？这是什么？像她一样的身体，像她一样的个头。”

“还有她的声音。”我补充说，“她整个人都在这里了，还有她的心。上帝祝福你，先生！能再次近距离地靠近你，我非常高兴。”

“简·爱！简·爱！”他不停地叫着。

“我亲爱的主人，”我回答，“我是简·爱。我找到了你——我回到你身边了。”

“真的？是她本人？我生动活泼的简·爱？”

“先生你摸摸我，你抱着我，抱得紧紧的。我并不像尸体那样冰冷，也不像空气那样虚无缥缈，是不是？”

“我活生生的宝贝！这些当然是她的四肢，当然是她的五官了。不过那番痛苦之后我可没有这福分了。这是一个梦，我晚上常常会梦见这种情形。再一次心贴心的交流，就像现在这样，吻她，觉得她爱我，相信她不会离开我。”

“从今天起，先生，我永远不会离开你了。”

“永远不会，幻象是这么说的吗？可我一醒来，总发觉原来是一场空。我凄凉孤独，我的生活黑暗、寂寞、无望；我的灵魂干渴，却不许喝水；我的心儿渴望食物，却没有人给我提供；温存轻柔的梦呀，这会儿你偎依在我的怀里，但你会飞走的，像早已逃之夭夭的姐妹们一样。可是，吻我一下，拥抱我一下再离开吧，简。”

“来，先生——来！”

我把嘴唇紧贴着当初目光炯炯如今已黯淡无光的眼睛上——我拨开了他额上的头发，吻了一下。他似乎突然醒悟，顿时相信这一切都是事实了。

“是你——是简吗，你回到我身边啦？”

“是的。”

“你没有死在那个溪流下面的沟里吗？你没有憔悴不堪，流落在异乡人中间吗？”

“没有，先生。我现在是一个完全独立的女人了。”

“独立！这话是什么意思，简？”

“我马德拉的叔叔去世了，给我留下了五千英镑的遗产。”

“哦，这可是够实在的，是真的！”他喊道，“我绝不会做这种梦。而且这是她特有的嗓音，那么活泼又那么温柔；它安慰了我干涸的心灵，让它复苏了。简，你成了独立的女人了、有钱的女人了？”

“很有钱了，先生。要是你不愿意我跟你一起生活，我可以紧靠你的房子建造一幢房子；晚上你要人做伴的时候，你可以过来，坐在我的客厅里。”

“可是你有钱了，简，不用说，如今一定会有朋友照顾你，不会容许你忠实于一个像我这样的瞎眼残疾的。”

“先生，我跟你说过我独立了，而且很有钱，我自己可以做主。”

“那你愿意同我一起生活吗？”

“当然——除非你反对。我愿当你的邻居、你的护士、你的管家。我发现你很孤独，我想成为你的伙伴，为你读书，和你一起散步，一起坐着聊天，服侍你，做你的眼睛和手。不要再这样忧郁了，我亲爱的主人；只要我活着一天，你就不会感到孤单寂寞的。”

他没有回答，神情很严肃而又心不在焉。他叹了口气；嘴唇半张着，好像有话要说，但又合上了。我感到有些尴尬。也许我提议陪伴他、帮助他是自作多情；也许我太坦白了，超越了礼数；也许他像圣·约翰一样，从我的粗疏中看到了我说话的不端庄。其实，我建议的目的，就是希望他求我做他的妻子。一种虽然没有说出口、却十分肯定的期待支持着我，认为他会立刻要求我成为他的人。但是他并没有吐出这一类暗示，他的面部表情越来越阴沉了。我猛地想到，也许自己全搞错了，或许无意中充当了傻瓜。我开始轻轻地从他的怀抱中抽出身来——但是他焦急地把我抓得更紧了。

“不——不——简，你一定不能走。不——我已经触摸到你，已经听到你说话，也已经感受到了有你的幸福——你甜蜜的抚慰。我不能放弃这些快乐，我快要一无所有了——但我必须拥有你。也许世人会笑话我——会说我荒唐、自私——但这都没有关系。我的灵魂渴求你，它希望得到满足，不然它会对躯体进行致命的报复。”

“好，先生，我愿意与你在一起，这我已经说过了。”

“不错——不过你理解的和我在一起与我理解的完全是两回事。也许你已经下定决心，要侍奉我左右，像一个好心的护士那样——你有一颗热诚的心、慷慨大度的灵魂，让你能为那些你所怜悯的人做出牺牲——对我来说，那已经够了。我想我现在对你只能有父亲般的情感了，你也是这么想的吗？过来和我说说吧。”

“你喜欢我怎么样，我就怎么想，先生；只做你一个人的护士我也很满足，如果你认为这样更好的话。”

“可你不能一辈子永远做我的护士，珍妮特。你还年轻——将来你还要结婚。”

“结不结婚我都无所谓。”

“你应当在乎，珍妮特。如果我还是以前的我，我会想尽办法让你在乎的——可是——我只是一个失去视力的废物！”

他又开始郁郁寡欢，一言不发了；而我，却更高兴，更大胆了。最后的这些话让我看到了他内心的矛盾；我不在乎这些困难，完全摆脱了先前的不安，谈话也畅快了许多。

“现在是有人帮助你重新做人的时候了，”我说着，扒开了他又粗又长没有理过的头发，“因为我知道你正蜕变成一头狮子，或是狮子一类的东西。你‘相似的模样[1]’，田野中的尼布甲尼撒2[2]。”

“这只胳膊既没有手也没有指甲。”他说着，从怀里抽出那只截了肢的手，伸给我看，“只有一截了，看上去很可怕，是吗，简？”

“看到它我很遗憾，你的眼睛，额头上的伤痕也一样让我难过。最糟糕的是，就因为这些，便有让人爱抚过分、照料过头把你惯坏的危险。”

“我想你看到我的胳膊和疤痕累累的面孔时会觉得厌恶的。”

“你是这样想的吗？别跟我说这样的话——不然我会对你的判断说出不恭的话来。好吧，让我走开一会儿，把火生得旺些，把壁炉清扫一下。火旺的时候，你能看得见吗？”

“能，右眼能看到红光——一阵红红的烟雾。”

“蜡烛光你能看见吗？”

“非常模糊——每根蜡烛像一团发亮的云彩。”

“你能看见我吗？”

“不能，我的天使。但我很感激上帝能让我听见你的声音，能感觉到你。”

“你什么时候吃晚饭？”

“我从来不吃晚饭。”

“但你今天晚上要吃一点。我饿了，我想你也肯定饿了，只不过你忘了而已。”

我把玛丽叫来，不久客厅就被收拾得整整齐齐，让人看了比较愉快。另外，我还给他准备了一顿可口的晚餐。我的精神很振奋，晚饭时候我与他轻松愉快地谈话；吃完饭好长时间以后，谈话仍在继续。跟他在一起，不存在令人痛苦的自制，没有必要压抑自己欢快的情绪；跟他在一起，感觉很自在，因为我知道自己跟他是天生一对。我所做的一切都能给他带来安慰，给他以新的生命。多么愉快的感觉！它唤醒了我全部的天性，使它释放光辉。在他面前，我尽情地生活着，同样，在我面前，他也尽情地生活着。尽管他眼睛看不见了，但笑容洋溢在他脸上，欢快跳跃在他的额头，他的面部表情温柔而又略显激动。

晚饭过后，他开始问关于我的许多问题。这些问题无非是我到底上哪儿去了，我这段时间都做了什么，我是怎么找到他的等等。但是我只能回答他的部分问题，因为那夜已经太晚，无法细谈了。此外，我不想去剧烈拨动那震颤的心弦，不想在他的心田开掘新情感。我眼下的唯一目的就是让他高兴。而如我所说，他现在很高兴，但却有些反复。如果沉默了一会儿，他会坐立不安，摸摸我，随后叫一声“简！”

“你是完完全全的人吗，简？你肯定是这样的吗？”

“我诚恳地相信是这样，罗切斯特先生。”

“可是，在这样一个悲哀的黑夜，你怎么会突然出现在我冷落的炉边呢？我伸手从一个用人那儿取一杯水，结果却是你端上来的。我问了个问题，期待着约翰的妻子回答我，我的耳边却响起了你的声音。”

“因为我替玛丽端着盘子进来了。”

“我现在与你一起度过的每一个时刻，都让我迷恋。谁能料到几个月来我挨过了黑暗、凄凉、无望的生活？什么也不干，什么也不盼，白天和黑夜不分。炉火熄了便感到冷，忘记吃饭便觉得饿。随后是无穷无尽的哀伤，有时就痴心妄想，希望再见见我的简。不错，重新拥有她的渴望远胜过恢复失去的视力。简怎么能跟我在一起，说她爱我呢？她会不会突然来，突然走呢？我担心明天我再也看不到她了。”

在他这样的心境中，给他一个普普通通、实实在在与他烦乱的思绪毫无联系的回答，是再好不过了，也最能让他放下心来。我用手指摸了摸他的眉毛，并说眉毛已被烧焦了，我可以敷上点什么，使它长得跟以往一样粗、一样黑。

“随你怎么做好事对我有什么用处呢，慈善的精灵？反正在关键时刻，你又会抛弃我，像影子一样消失；上哪儿去，怎么去，我一无所知，而且从此之后，我就再也找不到你了。”

“你身边有小梳子吗，先生？”

“干什么，简？”

“把乱蓬蓬的黑色鬃毛梳理一下。我凑近你细细打量时，发现你有些可怕。你说我是个精灵，而我相信，你更像一个棕仙。”

“我可怕吗，简？”

“很可怕，先生。你知道，你向来如此。”

“哼！不管你在哪儿待过一阵子，你还是改不掉那淘气的样子。”

“可是我跟很好的人待过，比你好得多，要好一百倍。这些人的想法和见解，你平生从来没有过。他们比你更文雅，更高尚。”

“你究竟跟谁一起生活过？”

“要是你那么扭动的话，我会把你的头发拔下来，那样我想你再也不会怀疑我是实实在在的人了吧。”

“你跟谁待过一阵子？”

“今天晚上别想从我这里得到任何消息了，先生，你必须等到明天早上才有答案。我的故事还有一半没有讲完，这才能保证我将出现在明天的早餐桌上把它讲完。顺便说一句，那时候，我得记住，不是只端着水在你的炉边出现，至少还得带个鸡蛋，更不必说带煎火腿了。”

“你这个爱嘲弄人的丑仙童——算你是仙女生、凡人养吧！你让我尝到了十二个月来从未有过的滋味。那就不需要弹琴就能把恶魔赶走了[3]。”

“瞧，先生，可把你收拾得整整齐齐、体体面面的了。这会儿我要离开你了。最近三天我一直奔波于旅途中，我想我很累了。晚安！”

“再问最后一句话，简，你前一阵子待的地方只有女士吗？”

我大笑着跑掉了，跑上楼梯还笑个不停。“好主意！”我快活地想道，“看来以后的日子我有办法让他急得忘掉忧郁了。”

第二天一大早，我听见他起来走动了，从一个房间摸到另一个房间。玛丽一下楼，我就听见他问：“爱小姐还在这儿吗？”接着又问：“你把她安排在哪一个房间了？里面干燥吗？她起床了吗？赶紧去问问她是否需要什么？她什么时候下楼来？”

约摸到了早餐的时候，我就下楼了。我蹑手蹑脚进了房间，在他发觉我进来之前，我就已经看见他了。说实话，看到那么一个生龙活虎的人变成了一个恹恹的弱者，怎能不叫人心酸。他坐在椅子上，虽然一动不动，却并不安分，显然在盼望着什么。如今，习惯性的愁容，已镌刻在他富有特色的脸庞上。他的面容就像一盏熄灭的灯，等待着再度点燃。唉！现在他自己已无力恢复生气勃勃、光彩照人的表情了，只好依赖他人来完成。我本想显得高高兴兴、无忧无虑，但是这个强者那么无能为力的样子，使我心碎了。不过我还是尽可能轻松愉快地跟他打了招呼：

“今天是个明亮晴朗的早晨，先生。”我说，“雨过天晴，阳光很怡人，你很快可以去走走了。”

我已唤醒了那道亮光，他顿时容光焕发了。

“啊，你真的还在，我的云雀！到我这儿来。你没有走，没有飞得无影无踪吗？一小时之前，我听见你的一个同类在高高的树林里歌唱，可是对我来说，它的歌声没有音乐感，就像初升的太阳没有光芒。凡我能听到的世间美妙的音乐，都集中在简的舌头上，凡我能感受到的阳光，都全聚在她身上。”

听完他表示对别人的依赖，我不禁热泪盈眶。他仿佛是被链条锁在栖木上的一只巨鹰，竟不得不企求一只麻雀为它觅食。不过，我不喜欢哭哭啼啼，抹掉带咸味的眼泪，便忙着去准备早餐了。

我们早上大部分时间都是在户外度过的。我领着他走出潮湿荒凉的树林，到了令人心旷神怡的田野。我向他描绘田野是多么翠绿，花朵和树篱又是多么新鲜，天空是多么蓝。我在一个隐蔽可爱的地方，替他找了个座位，那是一个干枯的树桩。坐定以后，我没有拒绝他把我放到他膝头上。既然他和我都觉得紧挨着比分开更愉快，那我又何必要拒绝呢？派洛特躺在我们旁边，四周一片寂静。他正把我紧紧地搂在怀里时突然嚷道：

“残忍，残忍的逃跑者！简，你知道当我发现你离开桑菲尔德庄园的时候，当我找遍所有地方都找不到你的时候，当我检查你的房间，确认你没带一分钱或其他可以值得变卖的东西的时候，我当时是什么感受吗？我曾经送你的那串珍珠项链原封不动地留在小盒子里。你的箱子捆好上了锁，像原先准备结婚旅行时一样。我当时就在想，身边没有一分钱，我完全赤贫的宝贝儿该怎么办？她干了些什么？现在讲给我听听吧。”

在他的追问下，我开始讲述我去年的经历。我美化了一下我三天的流浪和挨饿的经历，避免引起他不必要的心疼；但是我确实告诉他的一丁点儿，也撕碎了他那颗忠实的心，其严重程度超出了我的预料。

他说，我不该不带任何东西就离开他。我应该对他有信心，他永远都不会强迫我做他的情妇。尽管他绝望时性情暴烈，但事实上，他爱我至深至亲，绝不会变成我的暴君。他还说，他宁愿给我一半的财产，甚至不需要我回报他一个吻，也不愿意我一个人无亲无故地在广袤的世界上游荡。他确信，我所忍受的比我说给他听的要严重得多。

“嗯，不管我受什么样的苦，好在时间都不长。”我回答。随后我就继续给他讲我如何被沼泽居收留，又如何得到学校教师的职位等等，接着又讲了我如何继承遗产和如何发现了我的亲戚。当然，圣·约翰·里弗斯在我的故事中经常出现。当我讲完的时候，他的名字立即被单独提了出来。

“那位圣·约翰是你的表兄？”

“是的。”

“你经常提到他，你喜欢他吗？”

“他是个非常好的人，先生，我忍不住喜欢他。”

“一个好人？那意思是不是一个体面而品行好的五十岁的男人？不然，那是什么意思？”

“圣·约翰只有二十九岁，先生。”

“还年轻[4]，就像法国人说的。那么他是个矮小、冷淡、平庸的人吗？是不是那种虽没什么过错却不是德行出众的人？”

“他十分活跃，不知疲倦，他活着就是要成就伟大崇高的事业。”

“但他的头脑呢？大概比较软弱吧？他本意很好，但听他谈话你会耸肩。”

“他说话不多，先生。但一开口总是切中问题的要害。我想他的头脑是一流的，很固执，却十分活跃。”

“那么他很能干了？”

“确实很能干。”

“是一个受过良好教育的人？”

“圣·约翰是一个造诣高深、学识渊博的学者。”

“他的行为态度，我想你说过，不合你的口味？——正经，一副牧师腔调？”

“我从来没有提起过他的行为方式。除非我的口味很差，不然是很合意的。他的风度优雅、沉着，一副绅士派头。”

“他的外表——我忘了你是怎样描述他的外表了——那种没有经验的牧师，扎着白领巾，弄得气都透不过来；穿着厚底高帮靴，顶得像踏高跷似的，是吧？”

“圣·约翰一表人才，是个英俊的男子，高个子，白皮肤，蓝眼睛，鼻梁笔挺。”

他自言自语：“见他的鬼！”然后转向我：“你喜欢他吗，简？”

“我喜欢他，罗切斯特先生。不过你之前已经问过我了。”

当然，我觉察出了说话人的用意。忌妒已经攫住了他，刺痛了他。这是有益于身心的，让他暂时免受忧郁的咬啮。因此我不想立刻降服忌妒这条毒蛇。

“也许你不愿意在我膝头上坐下去了，爱小姐？”接着便是这出乎意料的话。

“为什么不愿意呢，罗切斯特先生？”

“你刚才所描绘的图画，暗示了一种十分强烈的对比。你的话已经巧妙地勾勒出一个漂亮的阿波罗。他出现在你的想象之中——‘高个子，白皮肤，蓝眼睛，鼻梁笔挺’。而你眼下看到的是一个伏尔甘——一个地道的铁匠，褐色的皮肤，宽阔的肩膀，瞎了眼睛，又瘸了腿。”

“我以前可从来没有想到过这点，不过你确实像个火神，先生！”

“好吧——你可以离开我了，小姐。但你走之前（他把我搂得更紧了），请你回答我一两个问题。”他顿了一下。

“什么问题，罗切斯特先生？”

接踵而来的便是下面这番盘问：

“圣·约翰在不知道你是他表妹之前让你当莫尔顿女子学校的老师？”

“是的。”

“你经常见到他吗？他有时候会去学校吗？”

“他每天都去学校。”

“简，他赞同你提出的计划吗？我知道那些计划肯定特别巧妙，因为你是一个有天赋的家伙。”

“是的——他赞同。”

“他会在你身上发现很多预料不到的东西，是吗？你身上的某些才艺不同寻常。”

“我不知道。”

“你曾经说过你住的小屋就在学校附近，那么他去你的小屋看过你吗？”

“偶尔。”

“晚上去过吗？”

“去过一两次。”

他停顿了一下。

“当你们的表兄妹关系发现以后，你和他以及他的妹妹们在一起住了多长时间？”

“五个月。”

“里弗斯先生和家里的女士们在一起的时候很多吗？”

“是的，后客厅既是他的书房，也是我们的书房。他坐在窗边，我们坐在桌子旁。”

“他读过很多书吗？”

“是的，很多。”

“都读些什么书？”

“印度斯坦语。”

“那时候你干什么呢？”

“起初学德语。”

“他教你吗？”

“他不懂德语。”

“他没教过你什么东西吗？”

“教了一点儿印度斯坦语。”

“里弗斯教你印度斯坦语？”

“是的，先生。”

“也教他的亲妹妹们吗？”

“没有。”

“只教你自己？”

“是的，就我自己。”

“是你要求他教的吗？”

“不是。”

“他希望教你？”

“是的。”

他又停顿了一下。

“他为什么主动教你？印度斯坦语对你有什么用处吗？”

“他要我和他一起去印度。”

“哦！这下子看到问题的根源了。他要你嫁给他吗？”

“他向我求过婚。”

“那是虚构的——胡编乱造来气我。”

“请你原谅，这是千真万确的事实。他不止一次地求过我，而且在这点上像你一样坚定不移。”

“爱小姐，我再重复一遍，你可以离开我了。这句话我说过多少次了？我已经通知你可以走了，为什么硬赖在我膝头上不走？”

“因为在这儿很舒服。”

“不，简，你在这儿不舒服，因为你的心根本就不在我这儿，它在你的表兄，那位圣·约翰那儿。在这一刻之前，我还幻想着我的简是完全属于我一个人的，我坚信她一直爱我，尽管她不在我身边，这是我痛苦中的安慰剂。但我万万没有想到，当我为我们的离别潸然泪下，为思念她黯然神伤的时候，她竟然爱上了别人！但悲痛也于事无补。简，离开我，去找里弗斯，和他结婚吧。”

“甩掉我吧，把我推开吧，我自己是不愿意离开你的。”

“简，我一直喜欢你说话的声调，它仍然能唤起新的希望，它听起来又那么真诚。我一听到它，便又被带回一年之前。我忘了你结识了新的关系。不过我不是傻瓜——走吧……”

“我要上哪儿去呢，先生？”

“你自己随便吧——到你看中的丈夫那儿去。”

“我看中的丈夫是谁？”

“你知道——圣·约翰·里弗斯。”

“他不是我的丈夫，永远不会是；他不喜欢我，我也不喜欢他。他以前爱着一个漂亮的女人，叫罗莎蒙德，不过她现在已经结婚了。他的爱和你的不同。他之所以想和我结婚，是因为他认为我适合做一个传教士的妻子，而她不适合。他非常善良和伟大，但太过严厉，对我，就像一座冰山一样。先生，他不像你，所以我在他旁边不高兴，不愿意靠近他和他在一起。他根本就不喜欢我，在我身上发现不了什么吸引人的地方，甚至连我的年轻都看不到，只是他心里想的我的几个用处而已。那么，先生，我还要离开你，去他那儿吗？”

我不由自主地哆嗦了一下，本能地把我失明而又亲爱的主人搂得更紧了。他微微一笑。

“什么，简？这是真的吗？这真是你与里弗斯之间的真实情况吗？”

“绝对是这样，先生，你不要吃醋啦！我只是想逗你一下，让你开心一些。我觉得愤怒总比哀伤要好一些吧。不过要是你希望我爱你，你就只要瞧一瞧我确实那么爱你，你就会自豪和满足了。我的整颗心都是你的，完完全全属于你，先生；而且它将永远陪伴着你，哪怕你把我身体其余的部分从这儿赶走。”

他吻我的时候，痛苦的想法又布满了他的脸庞。

“我烧毁了的视力！我伤残了的肢体！”他遗憾地咕哝着。

我抚摸着他，给他以安慰。我知道他心里想些什么，真想替他说出来，但我又不敢。当他把脸转过去的一刹那，泪珠从眼角滑落下来，看到这个，我的心猛地一下膨胀了。

“比起桑菲尔德果园那棵遭雷击的老栗子树，我也好不了多少。”没过多久，他说，“那些残枝，有什么权利吩咐一棵露出新芽的忍冬以自己的鲜艳来掩盖它的腐朽呢？”

“亲爱的，你不是残枝，也不是被雷劈的树。你是一片绿色，充满生机，嫩芽会依附着你的根，冒出芽来。不管你愿意与否，花草乐于躲在你慷慨的树荫的庇护下。长大后它们会偎依着你，缠绕着你，因为你的力量给了它们可靠的支撑。”

他再次笑了起来，我又给了他安慰。

“你说的是朋友吗，简？”他问。

“是的，是朋友。”我迟疑地回答。我知道我的意思超出了朋友，但无法判断要用什么词。他帮了我的忙。

“哦！可是，简，我需要一个妻子。”

“是吗，先生？”

“是的，对你来说这是新闻吗？”

“当然，先前你什么也没说。”

“是一则不受欢迎的新闻？”

“那就要看情况了，先生——要看你的选择。”

“你替我选择吧，简。我会遵从你的决定。”

“先生，那就挑最爱你的人吧。”

“我至少会选择我最爱的人，简。你愿意嫁给我吗？”

“我愿意，先生。”

“一个可怜的瞎子，你必须用手领着走路的人？”

“我愿意，先生。”

“一个比你大二十岁的瘸子，你得侍候的人？”

“我愿意，先生。”

“你说的都是真的吗，简？”

“完全是真的，先生。”

“哈，我的宝贝！愿上帝祝福你，报答你！”

“罗切斯特先生，如果我平生做过一件好事——如果我有过一个好的想法——如果我做过一个真诚而没有过错的祷告——如果我曾有过一个正当的心愿——那么现在我得到了酬报。对我来说，做你的妻子是世上最愉快的事了。”

“因为你乐意做出牺牲。”

“牺牲？我牺牲了什么？牺牲饥饿而得到食品，牺牲期待而得到满足，享受特权搂抱我珍重的人——亲吻我热爱的人——寄希望于我信赖的人，那能叫牺牲吗？如果说这是牺牲，那我当然乐于做出牺牲了。”

“还要忍受我的体弱，简，忽视我的缺陷。”

“我毫不在乎，先生。现在我确实对你有所帮助了，所以比起当初你能自豪地独立自主，除了施与者与保护人，把什么角色都不放在眼里时，要更爱你了。”

“到此刻为止，我很讨厌别人的帮助，讨厌别人给我做向导；但现在我不再讨厌了。我不喜欢用人牵着我的手，但我却渴望被简的小手牵着。与其让下人们来照顾，还不如独处，但是简温柔体贴的照应却永远是一种享受。简对我来说很合适，可我适合简吗？”

“你与我的天性丝丝入扣。”

“既然如此，就根本没有什么好等的了，我们得马上结婚。”

他的神态和说话都很急切，他焦躁的老脾气又发作了。

“我们必须毫不迟疑地化为一体了，简。只剩下把证书拿到手——随后我们就结婚——”

“罗切斯特先生，我刚发现，太阳向西偏移，早过了子午线。派洛特实际上已经回家吃饭了，让我看看你的手表。”

“把它别在你腰带上吧，珍妮特，今后你就留着，反正我用不上。”

“将近下午四点了，先生。你饿吗？”

“从今天算起第三天，应该是我们举行婚礼的日子，简。现在，别去管什么豪华衣装和金银首饰了，这些东西都那么微不足道。”

“太阳已经晒干了雨露，先生。风停了，天气很热。”

“你知道吗，简，此刻在领带下面青铜色的脖子上，我戴着你小小的珍珠项链。自从失去仅有的宝贝那天起，作为对你的纪念我就戴上它了。”

“我们穿过林子回家吧，这条路最阴凉。”

他顺着自己的思路去想，没有理会我说什么。

“简！我敢说你肯定认为我是一个没有宗教信仰的人吧，可这会儿我对世间仁慈的上帝充满了感激。他看事情不像平常人，他能看得更清楚一些；他判断事情也不同于常人，要更睿智一些。我错了，要不是上帝把它从我这儿抢走的话，我会玷污清白的花朵，把罪孽带给无辜。我倔犟地反抗，险些咒骂这种处理方式，我不是俯首听命，而是全不放在眼里。神的审判照旧进行，大祸频频临头。我被迫走过阴死的幽谷，他的惩罚十分严厉，其中一次惩罚使我永远甘于谦卑。你知道我曾经对自己的本事很自负，但如今看来却是那么微不足道。我现在脆弱得就像一个孩子，需要别人的引导才能行动。简，我最近开始承认上帝主宰着我们的命运，我愿意听从上帝的安排，开始自我反省和忏悔。我已经开始祈祷了，虽然很短，但很虔诚。

“已经有几天了，不，我能说出具体的时间，是四天。那是上星期一的晚上，一种不可名状的忧伤涌上我的心头。我到处找你都没有找到，想你一定早已不在人间。那天晚上十一到十二点左右，睡觉之前，我闷闷不乐地祈求上帝，如果可以的话，希望他能把我从人世间收走，希望他允许我到达未来的世界，那样我至少还有机会和我的简相聚。

“我坐在自己房间敞开的窗子边，清香的夜风沁人心脾。凭着发亮而又模糊的雾气，我知道那天晚上有月亮。我渴望着你，不管是肉体还是灵魂，我都渴望见到你。我既痛苦而又谦卑地问上帝，我凄凉、痛苦、备受折磨，是不是惩罚已经够了，能不能让我很快再次尝到幸福与平静。我承认我所忍受的一切都是罪有应得；我祈求上帝，我实在是快受不了了。我内心的全部愿望不由自主地脱口而出，化作这样几个字——‘简！简！简！’”

“你大声说了这几个字吗？”

“我说了，简。谁要是听见了，一定会以为我在发疯，我疯也似的使劲叫着那几个字。”

“而那是星期一晚上，半夜时分！”

“嗯！时间倒不是主要的，随后发生的事情很是奇怪。也许你会认为是我迷信，但我确实有些迷信，向来如此。不过这次是真的，我现在所说的听到的话，都是真的。

“我大声呼喊着‘简！简！简！’的时候，不知道从什么地方传来了‘我来了，请等一等我！’的声音，虽然不知道来自什么地方，但我却听得清清楚楚，知道说话的人是谁。

“要是我能够，我会告诉你这些话在我的心灵中所展示的思想和画面，不过要表达自己的想法并不容易。你知道，芬丁庄园深藏在密林里，这儿的声音很沉闷，没有回音便消失。‘你在哪儿呀？’这声音似乎来自大山中间，因为我听到了山林的回声重复着这几个字。这时空气凉爽清新，风似乎也朝我额头吹来。我会认为我与简在荒僻的野景中相会。我相信，在精神上我们一定已经相会了。毫无疑问，当时你睡得很熟，说不定你的灵魂脱离了它的躯壳来抚慰我的灵魂。因为那正是你的声音——千真万确——是你的！”

读者呀，正是星期一晚上，将近午夜时，我也听到了神秘的召唤，而那些正是我回答的话。我倾听着罗切斯特先生的叙述，却并没有向他吐露什么，我觉得这种巧合太令人畏惧、令人费解了，因而既难以言传，也无法议论。要是我说出什么来，我的经历也必定会在聆听者的心灵中留下深刻的印象，而这饱受痛苦的容易忧伤的心灵，不需要再笼罩在更深沉的超自然阴影中了。于是我把这些留在心里，反复思量。

“这会儿你不会奇怪了吧，”我的主人继续说，“那天晚上你出乎意料地在我面前冒出来时，我难以相信你不只是一个声音和幻象，不只是某种会销声匿迹的东西，就像以前已经消失的夜半耳语和山间回声那样。现在我感谢上帝，我知道这回不同了。是的，我感谢上帝！”

他把我从他的腿上抱下来，随后站了起来，虔诚地摘下帽子，用看不见的眼睛注视着大地，默默地站着。我只听见最后几句祷告的话语：

“我感谢造物主，在审判时还记得慈悲为怀。我谦恭地恳求我的救世主赐予我力量，让我们从今以后过一种更纯洁的生活！”

说完，他伸出手让我抓着。我握住那只亲爱的手，在我的唇边放了许久，然后把它放在了我的肩头。我的身高要比他矮许多，这样我既方便做他的拐杖，又可以做他的向导。我们进了树林，朝家里走去。

第三十八章


读者啊，我和他结婚了。我们举办了一个安安静静的婚礼，婚礼现场只有四个人：他、我、牧师和教堂的执事。从教堂回来，我走进庄园的厨房，玛丽正在那儿做晚饭，而约翰正在清洗餐刀，我说：

“玛丽，今天早上我和罗切斯特先生结婚了。”管家和她的丈夫都是不大动感情的规矩人，你什么时候都可以放心地告诉他们惊人的消息，而你的耳朵不会有被一声尖叫刺痛的危险，你也不会随之被一阵好奇的唠叨弄得目瞪口呆。玛丽确实抬起了头来，注视着我。她用来给两只烤着的鸡涂油的勺子，在空中停了大约三分钟，约翰忘了擦拭，手中的刀具停了同样长的时间。但是玛丽又弯下腰，忙她的烤鸡去了，只不过说：

“是真的吗，小姐？嗯，那毫无疑问！”

过了一会儿她接着说：“我看见你与主人出去，但我不知道你们是去教堂结婚的。”说完她又忙着给鸡涂油了。而约翰呢，我转向他的时候，已经笑得合不拢嘴了。

“我以前就告诉过玛丽事情会是什么样子，”他说，“我知道爱德华先生（约翰是个老用人，他的主人还是幼子的时候他就认识他了，因此他常常用教名称呼他）——我知道爱德华先生会怎么做。我肯定他不会等很久，也许他做得很对。祝你快乐，小姐！”他很有礼貌地拉了一下自己的额发[1]。

“谢谢你，约翰。罗切斯特先生让我把这个给你和玛丽。”

我把一张五英镑的钞票放到他的手里，他还来不及说什么，我就离开了厨房。不久当我穿过那个密室的时候，我听到了这样的话：

“也许她比什么阔小姐都好。”接着又说，“虽然她算不上最漂亮的，但也不丑，而且脾气又好。在他眼里她是个很美的美人，这点谁都看得出来。”

我也立即给沼泽居和剑桥方面写信，告诉他们我结婚的消息，并详细解释了我这么做的原因。黛安娜和玛丽对我的做法毫无保留地表示赞同，黛安娜还说，让我好好度蜜月，过一段时间就会来看我。

“还是别让她等到我们蜜月结束吧，简，”当我读信给他听的时候，他说，“如果这样，那就太晚了，因为我们蜜月的甜蜜将会照耀我们一生，它的光辉永远都不会退色，除非你或我进坟墓的时候。”

圣·约翰得到这个消息时候的反应我不得而知，我告诉他这个消息的那封信，他一直没有回复。但六个月后，他写信给我，信中没有提及罗切斯特先生的名字，也没有论及我的婚事。他的信平静而友好，尽管很严肃。从那以后，他保持着虽不经常但定期写信给我的习惯。他祝我快乐，并相信我不会是那种活在世上、只顾俗事而忘了上帝的人。

我相信读者还没有完全忘记小阿德拉吧，我并没有忘记。我请求罗切斯特先生允许我去阿德拉寄宿的学校看她，他答应了。她再次见到我时那种高兴的心情，着实令我感动。她看上去面容苍白消瘦，她还说她在那儿不愉快。我发现对她这个年龄段的孩子来说，这个学校的规章太严格，课程太紧张了，于是我把她带回家。我本想再当她的家庭教师，但不久却发现根本不可行。现在我的时间与精力都给了另一个人——我的丈夫。因此我选了一个校规比较宽松的学校，而且离家又近，那样我可以常常去探望她，有时还可以把她带回家来。我还留意让她过得舒舒服服，什么都不缺。她很快在新居所安顿下来了，在那儿过得很愉快，学习上也取得了长足进步。她长大以后，健全的英国教育在很大程度上纠正了她的法国式缺陷。她离开学校时，我发觉她已是一个讨人喜欢、懂礼貌的伙伴：和气、听话、很讲原则。她出于感激，对我和我家人的照应，早已报答了我在力所能及的情况下给予她的微小帮助。

我的故事快结束了。再说一句我婚后的生活，再看一眼书中最常出现的人物的命运吧，那样本书就可以结束了。

我们现在已经结婚十年了。我清楚地知道与这个世界上我最爱的人一起生活和为他生活是怎样一回事。我认为自己很幸福，幸福到了无法用言语表达的程度，因为我和他的生命完全相融，我丈夫完全是我的生命，正如我是他的生命一样。没有女人比我跟我的丈夫更为亲近了，我是他的骨中之骨、肉中之肉了。我与爱德华相处，永远不知疲倦，他与我相处也是如此，就像我们对搏动在各自的胸腔里的心跳不会厌倦一样。结果，我们始终待在一起。对我们来说，在一起既像独处时一样自由，又像相聚时一样欢乐。我想我们整天交谈着，相互交谈不过是一种听得见、更活跃的思索罢了。他与我推心置腹，我与他无话不谈。我们的性格完全投合，结果彼此心心相印。

我们结婚后的头两年，罗切斯特先生的眼睛仍然看不见，也许正是这种状况使我们彼此更加密切——靠得很紧，因为当时我成了他的眼睛，就像现在我依然是他的右手一样。我确实是他的眼睛，他常常这样称呼我。通过我，他观察自然，从书本中汲取知识；我毫无厌倦地替他观察，用语言来描述田野、树林、城镇、河流、云彩、阳光和面前的景色的效果，描述我们周围的天气——用声音使他的耳朵得到光线无法再使他的眼睛得到的印象。我从不厌倦地读书给他听，领他去想去的地方，干他想干的事。我乐此不疲，尽管有些伤心，却享受着充分而独特的愉快，因为他要求我帮忙时没有痛苦地感到羞愧，也没有沮丧地觉得屈辱。他真诚地爱着我，从不勉为其难地受我照料。他觉得我爱他如此之深，受我照料就是满足我最愉快的希望。

第二年年末的一个早晨，我正在写一封由他口授的信的时候，他走过来朝我低下头说：

“简，你脖子上有一件闪光的饰品吗？”

我挂着一根金表链，于是回答：“是的。”

“你还穿了件淡蓝色衣服，对吗？”

我当时确实穿了。随后他告诉我，已经有一段时间，他总觉得遮住眼睛的那层黑暗在渐渐变薄，现在更相信这种说法了。

我们去了一趟伦敦，看了一位很有名望的眼科医生，他最终恢复了一只眼的视力。他现在看不太清楚，也不能长时间、大量地阅读和写作，但是他可以在没有别人引导的情况下走路。此时，天空对他来说不再只是一片空白，土地对他来说也不再是一片虚空。当他抱着我们第一个孩子的时候，他还可以看到小男孩继承了他的眼神，就像他失明前一样，又大、又亮、又黑。在那一时刻，他又一次甘愿承认，上帝仁慈地减轻了对他的惩罚。

从此，爱德华和我都过上了幸福的生活，尤其使我们感到幸福的是，我们最爱的人也一样很幸福。黛安娜和玛丽都结婚了。我们轮流拜访，一年一次，不是他们来看我们，就是我们去看她们。黛安娜的丈夫是个海军上校，一位英武的军官，一个好人。玛丽的丈夫是位牧师，她哥哥大学里的朋友，无论从造诣还是品行来看，这门亲事都很般配。菲茨詹姆斯上校和沃顿先生与自己的妻子彼此相爱。

圣·约翰·里弗斯先生，离开英国，去了印度。他继续在自己规划的道路上走着，并将依然走下去，他奋斗在岩石和危险之中，再也没有比他更坚定不移、不知疲倦的先驱者了。他是那么坚决、忠实、虔诚。他精力充沛、热情真诚地为自己的同类含辛茹苦，他为他们开辟艰辛的前进之路，像巨人一般砍掉拦在路上的信条和等级的偏见。他也许很严厉，也许很苛刻，也许还雄心勃勃；但他的严厉是武士大心[2]一类的严厉，大心保卫他所护送的香客免受亚玻伦人的袭击，他的苛刻是使徒的苛刻，他代表上帝说：“若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。”他的雄心是高尚的主的精神的雄心，目的是要名列被拯救出尘世者的前茅——这些人毫无过错地站在上帝的宝座前，分享耶稣最后的伟大胜利。他们被召唤，被选中，都是些忠贞不贰的人。

圣·约翰没有结婚，现在看来他再也不会结婚了。他一人足以胜任辛劳，不过他的劳作也快要结束。他那光芒四射的太阳就要匆匆下沉了。在给我的最后一封信里，他留下了世俗的眼泪，也使我心中充满了神圣的欢乐。他提前得到了必定得到的酬报，那不朽的桂冠。我知道一只陌生的手随之会写信给我，说这位善良而忠实的仆人已最终被召安享主的欢乐了。为什么要为此哭泣呢？不会有死的恐惧使圣·约翰的临终时刻暗淡无光。他的头脑十分明晰，他的心灵无所畏惧，他的希望十分可靠，他的信念不可动摇。他自己的话就是一个很好的保证：

“我的主，”他说，“已经预先警告过我。他每天都更加清楚地宣告：‘是了，我一定赶紧来。’我每时每刻更加急切地回答：‘阿门，主耶稣啊，我愿你来！’[3]”

PREFACE


A preface to the first edition of Jane Eyre being unnecessary, I gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.

My thanks are due in three quarters.

To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions.

To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant.

To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author.

The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large‑hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, that is, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.

Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as Jane Eyre in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.

Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns. These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded; appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.

The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinize and expose, to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it, to penetrate the sepulchre and reveal charnal relics; but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.

Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.

There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears; who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel, and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital, a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the satirist of Vanity Fair admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time, they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Ramoth-Gilead.

Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognized; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day, as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterize his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does the electric death—spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him-if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of Jane Eyre.

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION


I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of Jane Eyre affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone. If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited: and consequently, denied where it is justly due.

This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I


There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out door exercise was now out of the question.

I was glad of it; I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.

The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group, saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy little children."

"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.

"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."

A small breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.It contained a bookcase; I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near, a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.

I returned to my book—Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl of "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—





"Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,

Boils round the naked, melancholy isles

Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge

Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."





Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold." Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.

I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.

The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.

The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.

So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.

Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery-hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.

With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door was opened.

"Boh! Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.

"Where the dickens is she!" he continued. "Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!"

"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I, and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once—"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."

And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack.

"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.

"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed,'" was the answer. "I want you to come here"; and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.

John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, "on account of his delicate health." Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application, and, perhaps, to pining after home.

John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs.Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence; more frequently, however, behind her back.

Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.

"That is for your impudence in answering mama a while since," said he, "and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"

Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it: my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.

"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.

"I was reading."

"Show the book."

I returned to the window and fetched it thence.

"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense. Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows."

I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.

"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said. "You are like a murderer—you are like a slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!"

I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.

"What! what!" he cried. "Did she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first—"

He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant: a murderer.I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort. I don't very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat! Rat!" and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the words—

"Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!"

"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"

Then Mrs. Reed subjoined: "Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there." Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.





CHAPTER II


I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say. I was conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.

"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."

"For shame, for shame!" cried the lady's-maid. "What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!Your young master."

"Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?"

"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."

They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs.Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pairs of hands arrested me instantly.

"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie. "Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."

Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.

"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."

In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.

"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.

"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.

"But it was always in her," was the reply. "I've told missis often my opinion about the child, and missis agreed with me. She's an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."

Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said, "You ought to be aware, miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off you would have to go to the poorhouse."

I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing song in my ear; very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Missis Abbot joined in—

"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them. They will have a great deal of money and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them."

"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice."You should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, missis will send you away, I am sure."

"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away."

They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.

The red-room was a spare chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour, with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly-polished old mahogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it, and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.

This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchens; solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered. The housemaid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust; and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.

Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.

My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas! yes! no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.

Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.

All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference, all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?

Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less punished, though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea—chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling". I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.

My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received; no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned against him to avert further irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.

"Unjust!—unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonizing stimulus into precocious though transitory power; and resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.

What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the ceaseless inward question—why I thus suffered; now, at the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.

I was a discord in Gateshead Hall; I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathize with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.

Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle—my mother's brother—that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband's death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.

A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not—never doubted—that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn; but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift-darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.

"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.

"What a dreadful noise! It went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.

"Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.

"What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?" again demanded Bessie.

"Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come." I had now got hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.

"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust."And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here; I know her naughty tricks."

"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs.Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily. "Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself."

"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.

"Let her go," was the only answer. "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer; you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then."

"O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it—let me be punished some other way! I shall be killed if—"

"Silence! This violence is all most repulsive;" and so, no doubt, she felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes: she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous duplicity.

Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without further parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.





CHAPTER III


The next thing I remember is waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.

In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire.It was night: a candle burnt on the table: Bessie stood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.

I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed. Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physician.

"Well, who am I?" he asked.

I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it, smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by and by." Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.

"Do you feel as if you should sleep, miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.

Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be rough. "I will try."

"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"

"No, thank you, Bessie."

"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you may call me if you want anything in the night."

Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.

"Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?"

"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better soon, no doubt."

Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment which was near. I heard her say—

"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be alone with that poor child tonight; she might die; it's such a strange thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis was rather too hard."

Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half an hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed.

"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"—"A great black dog behind him"—"Three loud raps on the chamber door"—"A light in the churchyard just over his grave" etc., etc.

At last both slept; the fire and the candle went out. For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and mind were alike strained by dread, such dread as children only can feel.

No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the redroom: it only gave my nerves a shock, on which I feel the reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering. But I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.

Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worst ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears. No sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there—they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.

Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not eat the tart: and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded! I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdingnag being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-?like men and women of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hands—when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table beside the untasted tart.

Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.Meantime she sang: her song was—





"In the days when we went gipsying,

A long time ago."

I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice—at least, I thought so. But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly"a long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one.





"My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;

Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;

Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary

Over the path of the poor orphan child.



Why did they send me so far and so lonely,

Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?

Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only

Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.



Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,

Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,

God, in His mercy, protection is showing,

Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.



Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,

Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,

Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,

Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.



There is a thought that for strength should avail me,

Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;

Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;

God is a friend to the poor orphan child."





"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie, as she finished. She might as well have said to the fire, "Don't burn!" but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.

"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery. "Well, nurse, how is she?"

Bessie answered that I was doing very well.

"Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name is Jane, is it not?"

"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."

"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about? Have you any pain?"

"No, sir."

"Oh! I dare say she is crying because she could not go out with missis in the carriage," interposed Bessie.

"Surely not! Why, she is too old for such pettishness."

I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable."

"Oh fie, miss!" said Bessie.

The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey; not very bright; but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered me at leisure, he said, "What made you ill yesterday?"

"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.

"Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can't she manage to walk at her age? She must be eight or nine years old."

"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride; "But that did not make me ill," I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.

As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for the servants' dinner; he knew what it was. "That's for you, nurse," said he; "You can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."

Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.

"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd, when Bessie was gone.

"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost, till after dark."

I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. "Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?"

"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am; he died in that room, and was laid out there.Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it."

"Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in daylight?"

"No: but night will come again before long; and besides, I am unhappy—very unhappy, for other things."

"What other things? Can you tell me some of them?"

How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.

"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."

"You have a kind aunt and cousins."

Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced—

"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the redroom."

Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.

"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he. "Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"

"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant."

"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"

"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."

"Perhaps you may who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs.Reed?"

"I think not, sir."

"None belonging to your father?"

"I don't know. I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about them."

"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"

I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.

"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.

"Not even if they were kind to you?"

I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind, and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste.

"But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?"

"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any they must be a beggarly set; I should not like to go a-begging."

"Would you like to go to school?"

Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John Reed hated his school and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation, as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change; it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.

"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my musings.

"Well, well; who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up. "The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to himself; "Nerves not in a good state."

Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel walk.

"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd. "I should like to speak to her before I go."

Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from after occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, "Missis was," she dared say, "glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand." Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.

On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent; that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month of each other.

Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied too, Abbot."

"Yes," responded Abbot; "If she were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that."

"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "At any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."

"Yes, I dote on miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot. "Little darling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper."

"So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down." They went.





CHAPTER IV


From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near—I desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks passed; I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me; since my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children, appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.

Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible; John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose. I had, indeed, levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat; he was stopped rather harshly—

"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her: she is not worthy of notice. I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her."

Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on my words—

"They are not fit to associate with me!"

Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.

"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.

"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold, composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.

"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead."

Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. I half believed her, for I felt, indeed, only bad feelings surging in my breast.

November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringleted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed: and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doted on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.

Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs. Sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said, "Good night, Miss Jane." When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty, too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice; still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.

It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning.Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm gardencoat to go and feed her poultry—an occupation of which she was fond, and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.

Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under nursery-maid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, etc.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night dress, I went to the window seat to put in order some picture books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.

From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door bell rang loudly, the new comer was admitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry tree nailed against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.

"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore. What are you doing there? Have you washed your hands and face this morning?" I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—

"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."

"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?"

I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.

I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs.Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.

I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.

"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts. "What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a woman?" The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at a black pillar! such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.

Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you."

He—for it was a man—turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking gray eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice— "Her size is small: what is her age?"

"Ten years."

"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me—

"Your name, little girl?"

"Jane Eyre, sir."

In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.

"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"

Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."

"Sorry indeed to hear it! She and I must have some talk;" and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the armchair opposite Mrs.Reed's. "Come here," he said.

I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!

"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?"

"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.

"And what is hell? Can you tell me that?"

"A pit full of fire."

"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for-ever?"

"No, sir."

"What must you do to avoid it?" I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable: "I must keep in good health, and not die."

"How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since, a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence." Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.

"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."

"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly, "they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."

"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.

"Yes, sir."

"Do you read your Bible?"

"Sometimes."

"With pleasure? Are you fond of it?"

"I like Revelations, and the Book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah."

"And the Psalms? I hope you like them?"

"No, sir."

"No? Oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, 'Oh! The verse of a Psalm! Angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little angel here below.' He then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety."

"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.

"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.

"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit.I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."

Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?

"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.

"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."

"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects," continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood."

"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.Brocklehurst. "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mamma to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they are almost like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and mamma's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"

"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."

"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants."

"Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects?"

"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election."

"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome."

"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will he no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye."

"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."

"I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'an account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G—, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.'"

With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.

Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.

Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.

Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.

"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate. My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.

Speak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—

"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."

Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.

"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.

That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—

"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty."

"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"

"How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the TRUTH.You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the redroom, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!' And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hardhearted. You are deceitful!"

Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she would cry.

"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?"

"No, Mrs. Reed."

"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to be your friend."

"Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done."

"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for their faults."

"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.

"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery—there's a dear—and lie down a little."

"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.Reed, for I hate to live here."

"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed, sotto voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.

I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's solitude.First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.

Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned. Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.

I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, "Onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes fell at intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, "What shall I do?—what shall I do?"

All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you? Come to lunch!"

It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came tripping down the path.

"You naughty little thing!" she said. "Why don't you come when you are called?"

Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just put my two arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."

The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her.

"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me; "a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I suppose?"

I nodded.

"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"

"What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me."

"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should be bolder."

"What! To get more knocks?"

"Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that's certain. My mother said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place. Now, come in, and I've some good news for you."

"I don't think you have, Bessie."

"Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I'll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."

"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."

"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of me. Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so provoking."

"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread."

"If you dread them they'll dislike you."

"As you do, Bessie?"

"I don't dislike you, miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others."

"You don't show it."

"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking. What makes you so venturesome and hardy?"

"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"—I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.

"And so you're glad to leave me?"

"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."

"Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say you'd rather not."

"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down." Bessie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.





CHAPTER V


Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed. I had risen half an hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m.Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid missis good-bye?"

"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."

"What did you say, miss?"

"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the wall."

"That was wrong, Miss Jane."

"It was quite right, Bessie. Your missis has not been my friend: she has been my foe."

"O Miss Jane! Don't say so!"

"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door. The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.

"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.

"Yes."

"And how far is it?"

"Fifty miles."

"What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone."

The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung with kisses.

"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted me into the inside.

"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "all right", and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.

I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the "Stony Street" of L—.

The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.

Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coachdoor was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.

"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked. I answered "Yes."and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.

I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.

I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.

The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect.

"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further added—

"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.

"A little, ma'am."

"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?"

I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed me along with Miss Miller.

The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their tomorrow' s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.

Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up to the top of the long room: she cried out—

"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"

Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—

"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"

The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common to all.When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.

The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. Tonight I was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.

The night passed rapidly. I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room.I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—

"Form classes!"

A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!" When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.

A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her seat. Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.

Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat!I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.

The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words—

"Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!"

"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.

Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—

"Abominable stuff! How shameful!"

A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly.Poor things! It was the sole consolation they had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.

A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried—

"Silence! To your seats!"

Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a workbag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.

I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing, looked purple, weatherbeaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.

What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—

"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"

While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book entrusted to me to carry to church.

The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, etc., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose—

"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.

The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice. She went on—

"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry. I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all."

The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.

"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.

The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now given"To the garden!" Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.

The garden was a wide enclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered veranda ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay.I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise—not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the veranda; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.

As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the veranda, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription—





"Lowood Institution.—This portion was rebuilt A.D.—, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county." "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven."—St. Matt. v. 16.





I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was still pondering the signification of "Institution", and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title—it was Rasselas; a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly—

"Is your book interesting?" I had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day.

"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which she examined me.

"What is it about?" I continued. I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.

"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.

I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title. Rasselas looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—

"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowood Institution?"

"This house where you are come to live."

"And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from other schools?"

"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?"

"Both died before I can remember."

"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans."

"Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?"

"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."

"Then why do they call us charity-children?"

"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription."

"Who subscribes?" "Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London."

"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"

"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."

"Why?"

"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."

"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"

"To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes."

"Does he live here?"

"No—two miles off, at a large hall."

"Is he a good man?"

"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."

"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"

"Yes."

"And what are the other teachers called?"

"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work, and cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French."

"Do you like the teachers?"

"Well enough."

"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame—?—I cannot pronounce her name as you do."

"Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."

"But Miss Temple is the best—isn't she?"

"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because she knows far more than they do."

"Have you been long here?"

"Two years."

"Are you an orphan?"

"My mother is dead."

"Are you happy here?"

"You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for the present: now I want to read."

But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day's fare would be like this.

After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.

The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the veranda dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. "How can she bear it so quietly—so firmly?" I asked of myself. "Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether good or naughty."

Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half a slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I was still hungry. Half an hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.





CHAPTER VI


The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.

Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been doubled.

In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, etc., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the veranda: at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following—

"Burns (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), Burns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately." "Burns, you poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in." "Burns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude," etc. etc.

A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I, and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out—

"You dirty, disagreeable girl! You have never cleaned your nails this morning!"

Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence. "Why," thought I, "does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?"

My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, etc.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.

"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "Nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."

Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.

The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.

On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.

Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace: as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.

Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.

"Is it still Rasselas?" I asked, coming behind her.

"Yes," she said. "And I have just finished it."

And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this. "Now," thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk." I sat down by her on the floor.

"What is your name besides Burns?"

"Helen."

"Do you come a long way from here?"

"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."

"Will you ever go back?"

"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."

"You must wish to leave Lowood?"

"No: why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."

"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"

"Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults."

"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her. If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should break it under her nose."

"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil."

"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it."

"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required to bear."

I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathize with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.

"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very good."

"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances. I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."

"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition: she kept silence.

"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"

At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her grave face.

"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."

"That is curious." said I, "It is so easy to be careful."

"For you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house; then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready."

"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."

"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!"

Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she discussed. I recalled her to my level.

"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"

"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain."

"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"

"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides me. There is no merit in such goodness."

"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again."

"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are but a little untaught girl."

"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."

"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine; but Christians and civilised nations disown it."

"How? I don't understand."

"It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury."

"What then?"

"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."

"What does he say?"

"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you."

"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son John, which is impossible."

In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.

Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a remark, but she said nothing.

"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?"

"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because, you see, she dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you! What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain—the impalpable principle of life and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."

Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—

"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"

Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay.





CHAPTER VII


My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.

During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet. I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.

Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.

At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.

I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers." The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.

How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.

A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.

The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors' high stools.

I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.

One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.

I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, etc.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise—I had been looking out daily for the "coming man", whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.

He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.

"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma'am! I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."

He paused.

"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.

"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them to one."

"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion."

Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.

"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned.Who introduced this innovation? And by what authority?"

"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple: "the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."

"Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, 'If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye.' Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"

Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity.

Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used—

"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—what is that girl with curled hair? Red hair, ma'am, curled—curled all over?" And extending his cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.

"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.

"Julia Severn, ma'am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"

"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.

"Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly.Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber tomorrow: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."

Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed.Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.

He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—

"All those top-knots must be cut off."

Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.

"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame—facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of—"

Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.

These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention.

Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.

"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—"It is the new pupil, I perceive." And before I could draw breath, "I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her." Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me!"Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"

Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—

"Don't be afraid, Jane. I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished."

The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.

"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.

"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.

"Place the child upon it."

And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.

Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.

"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?"

Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin.

"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."

A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.

"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, "this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl is—a liar!"

Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, "How shocking!" Mr. Brocklehurst resumed—

"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her."

With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room. Turning at the door, my judge said—

"Let her stand half an hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day."

There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken gray eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm "the untidy badge"; scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow, because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature of man! Such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.





CHAPTER VIII


Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?

"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.

"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke—

"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?"

"Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."

"But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise me."

"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you; many, I am sure, pity you much."

"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"

"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man: he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane"—she paused.

"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on—

"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends."

"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough; if others don't love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—"

"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign Hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence—if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front—and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to glory?"

I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.

Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.

"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."

We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.

"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face, "Have you cried your grief away?"

"I am afraid I never shall do that."

"Why?"

"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked."

"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."

"Shall I, Miss Temple?"

"You will," said she, passing her arm round me, "and now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"

"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care."

"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"

"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me."

"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can.Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing."

I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.

In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.

I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she then said—

"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now."

She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.

"How are you tonight, Helen? Have you coughed much today?"

"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."

"And the pain in your chest?"

"It is a little better."

Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—

"But you two are my visitors tonight; I must treat you as such." She rang her bell.

"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."

And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.

"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter? There is not enough for three."

Barbara went out: she returned soon—

"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."

Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.

"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "We must make it do, Barbara, I suppose." And as the girl withdrew, she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."

Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.

"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she; "but as there is so little toast, you must have it now;" and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.

We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.

Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.

Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.

The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple's—a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.

They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime; no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—

"God bless you, my children!"

Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.

On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that tomorrow she should have half a dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.

"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a low voice. "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."

Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire. The fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.

About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.

Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty. I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits. In a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I learned the first two tenses of the verb etre, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by the way, out-rivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings. I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

Well has Solomon said, "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith."

I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries.





CHAPTER IX


But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring drew on—she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snowdrops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays)we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.

I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—When mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.

April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration.And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.

Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream? Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question.

That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fogbred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into a hospital.

Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.

While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.

But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.

My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson, a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.

And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far higher things.

True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus; and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.

I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the veranda.

One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer; the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before—

"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows where…"

And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.

"How is Helen Burns?"

"Very poorly," was the answer.

"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"

"Yes."

"And what does he say about her?"

"He says she'll not be here long."

This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.

"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.

"May I go up and speak to her?"

"Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."

The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.

It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see Helen, I must embrace her before she died—I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.

Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple's room. A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with keen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.

Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.

"Helen!" I whispered softly. "Are you awake?"

She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated.

"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.

"Oh!" I thought. "She is not going to die; they are mistaken; she could not speak and look so calmly if she were."

I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.

"Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it strike some minutes since."

"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you."

"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."

"Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?"

"Yes; to my long home—my last home."

"No, no, Helen!" I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered—

"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt." I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering—

"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual; my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father, and he is lately married, and will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault."

"But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?"

"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."

"Where is God? What is God?"

"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me."

"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we die?"

"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."

"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"

"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."

Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. "Where is that region? Does it exist?" And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the sweetest tone—

"How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me."

"I'll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away."

"Are you warm, darling?"

"Yes."

"Good-night, Jane."

"Good-night, Helen."

She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.

When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was—dead.

Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."





CHAPTER X


Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography. I am only bound to invoke memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection.

When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils' wretched clothing and accommodations—all these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.

Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee.Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.

During these eight years my life was uniform; but not unhappy, because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.

Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.

From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.

But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.

I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.

I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eyes passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space; "Then," I cried, half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"

Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.

I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.

Miss Gryce snored at last. She was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance. Tonight I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.

"A new servitude! There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). "I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing feasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."

I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to think again with all my might.

"What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?"

I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.

A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind. "Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the—shire Herald."

"How? I know nothing about advertising."

Replies rose smooth and prompt now:

"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."

This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind: I had it in a clear practical form; I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.

With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:





"A young lady accustomed to tuition (had I not been a teacher two years?) is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age). She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive). Address J.E., Post Office, Lowton, —shire."





This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.

The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale; but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.

My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.

"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.

She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter. At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E.

"Is there only one?" I demanded.

"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward. I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and it was already half past seven.

Various duties awaited me on my arrival. I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had finished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.





"If J.E., who advertised in the —shire Herald of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction: —Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, —shire."





I examined the document long: the writing was old−fashioned and rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en règle. I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote,—shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town. —shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A—; a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke—"but,"—I argued, "Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town."

Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.

Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references. She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs." This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should forthwith be furnished me.

This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house.

I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk—the same I had brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.

The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half an hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life was closing to night, a new one opening to morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished.

"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering like a troubled spirit, "A person below wishes to see you."

"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.I was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—

"It's her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!" cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.

I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively complexion.

"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised; "You've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"

In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!Bessie! Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.

"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.

"Then you are married, Bessie?"

"Yes: nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."

"And you don't live at Gateshead?"

"I live at the Lodge: the old porter has left."

"Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.

"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued Mrs. Leaven. "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth."

"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"

"Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling—"

"Well, and what of John Reed?"

"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to college, and he got—plucked, I think they call it; and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think."

"What does he look like?"

"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he has such thick lips."

"And Mrs. Reed?"

"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her—he spends a deal of money."

"Did she send you here, Bessie?"

"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country, I thought I'd just set off and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach."

"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie." I said this laughing: I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration. "No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child."

I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.

"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace. "What can you do? Can you play on the piano?"

"A little." There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.

"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly. "I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"

"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece." It was a landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.

"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"

"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."

"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"

"I can."

"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father's kinsfolk, the Eyres?"

"Never in my life."

"Well, you know missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your father's brother."

"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"

"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did tell me—"

"Madeira?" I suggested.

"Yes, that is it—that is the very word."

"So he went?"

"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: missis was very high with him; she called him afterwards 'a sneaking tradesman'. My Robert believes he was a wine-merchant."

"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant."

Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.





CHAPTER XI


A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe.All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.

Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the "boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.

It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when half an hour elapsed and still I was alone. I bethought myself to ring the bell.

"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of the waiter who answered the summons.

"Thornfield? I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar." He vanished, but reappeared instantly—

"Is your name Eyre, miss?"

"Yes."

"Person here waiting for you."

I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the innpassage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.

"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.

"Yes." He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.

"A matter of six miles."

"How long shall we be before we get there?"

"Happen an hour and a half."

He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.

"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her: let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.How far are we on our road now, I wonder?"

I let down the window and looked out: Millcote was behind us; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.

The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said—

"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."

Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.

"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.

A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking.She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beauideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.

"How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."

"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.

"Yes, you are right: do sit down."

She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.

"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom."

And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and delivered them to the servant.

"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire;" she continued. "You've brought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.

"She treats me like a visitor," thought I. "I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon." She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.

"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax tonight?" I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.

"What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf," returned the good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.

I repeated the question more distinctly.

"Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your future pupil." "Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?"

"No, I have no family."

I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.

"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took the cat on her knee: "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one's authority. I'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adèla Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."

My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.

"But I'll not keep you sitting up late tonight," said she; "it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your bedroom.I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."

I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and vaultlike air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.

When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.

The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite future period.

I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quaker-like as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.

Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine Autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion. It was three stories high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.

I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.

"What! out already?" said she. "I see you are an early riser." I went up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.

"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked. I told her I liked it very much.

"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."

"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed. "Who is he?"

"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly. "Did you not know he was called Rochester?"

Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.

"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."

"To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the housekeeper—the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother's side; or, at least my husband was; he was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester's mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on the connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I expect nothing more."

"And the little girl—my pupil?"

"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her. He intended to have her brought up in —shire, I believe. Here she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse." The enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame, but a dependent like myself. I did not like her the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much the better—my position was all the freer.

As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.

"Good morning, Miss Adèla," said Mrs. Fairfax. "Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day." She approached.

"C'est la gouvernante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her nurse; who answered—

"Mais oui, certainement."

"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.

"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adèla was born on the Continent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I dare say."

Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adèla. She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.

"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie. She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf. And mademoiselle—what is your name?"

"Eyre—Jane Eyre."

"Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called a hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs."

"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.

I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.

"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"

"Adèle," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of?"

"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you hear me sing now?"

She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.

The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I thought so.

Adèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naïveté of her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now, mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."

Assuming an attitude, she began La Ligue des Rats; fable de La Fontaine. She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age; and which proved she had been carefully trained.

"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.

"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez-vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!' She made me lift my hand so to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?"

"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?"

"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself, and I never see him."

After breakfast, Adèle and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, etc. I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.

I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use.

As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said she. She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.

"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.

"Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."

She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Pariain mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.

"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I. "No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily."

"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."

"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"

"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them."

"Do you like him? Is he generally liked?"

"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind."

"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked for himself?"

"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived much amongst them."

"But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?"

"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him."

"In what way is he peculiar?"

"I don't know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good master."

This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.

When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings, all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.

"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.

"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."

"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"

"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.

"Nor any traditions of one? No legends or ghost stories?"

"I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."

"Yes—'after life's fitful fever they sleep well.'" I muttered. "Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.

"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?" I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.

Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard's castle.

While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.

"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs. "Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?"

"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."

"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.

"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.Sometimes Leah is with her: they are frequently noisy together."

The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd murmur.

"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.

I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachination; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.

The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out—a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.

"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax. "Remember directions!" Grace curtseyed silently and went in.

"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work," continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough. By-the-by, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?"

The conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below. Adèle came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming—

"Mesdames, vous êtes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"

We found dinner ready and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.





CHAPTER XII


The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.

This, par parenthèse , will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adèle's welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little self; just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.

Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.

Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.

It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.

When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (Oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.

The other members of the household, viz, John and his wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.

October, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as Adèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk.Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her "Revenez bient t, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle. Jeannette." with a kiss I set out.

The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.

This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay: having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.

On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes.That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.

A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.

The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash", which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.

It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse followed—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this—only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do—there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question—

"Are you injured, sir?"

I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.

"Can I do anything?" I asked again.

"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!" The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.

I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him again.

"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay."

"Thank you; I shall do: I have no broken bones—only a sprain," and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary "Ugh!"

Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright; I could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared, and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.

If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—

"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."

He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before.

"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"

"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter."

"You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?" pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.

"Yes, sir."

"Whose house is it?"

"Mr. Rochester's."

"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"

"No, I have never seen him."

"He is not resident, then?"

"No."

"Can you tell me where he is?"

"I cannot."

"You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—" He stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady's maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.

"I am the governess."

"Ah, the governess!" he repeated, "Deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.

"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so kind."

"Yes, sir."

"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"

"No."

"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not afraid?"

I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet. The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.

"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to come here."

I came. "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you useful." He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.

"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge."

I sought it and found it.

"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you can."

A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished—





"Like heath that, in the wilderness,

The wild wind whirls away."





I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the postoffice; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.

I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk—to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his.

I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me, a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.

The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit only by the high-hung bronze lamp: a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase.This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.

I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it that I went forward and said "Pilot" and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.

"What dog is this?"

"He came with master."

"With whom?"

"With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived."

"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"

"Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained."

"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"

"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."

"Ah! Bring me a candle, will you, Leah?"

Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.





CHAPTER XIII


Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.

Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.

Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose contents she had an interest.

"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura là-dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. monsieur a parlé de vous: il m'a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'était pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu p le. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"

I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.

In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.

"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."

"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.

"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle."

"Is it necessary to change my frock?"

"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here."

This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.

"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. I let Mrs.Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.

Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt near him.Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire shone full on his face.I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term—Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.

"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.

"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."

I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.

He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs.Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.

"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got. She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, etc., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.

"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adèle might perhaps spill it."

I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—

"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?"

"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly: "did you expect a present, Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.

"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things."

"Generally thought? But what do you think?"

"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? And one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature."

"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a 'cadeau' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."

"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."

"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adèle, and find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."

"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau'; I am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils' progress."

"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.

"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres. We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.

"You have been resident in my house three months?"

"Yes, sir."

"And you came from—?"

"From Lowood school, in —shire."

"Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?"

"Eight years."

"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?"

"I have none."

"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"

"No."

"I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile?"

"For whom, sir?"

"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?"

I shook my head. "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. "And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more."

Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.

"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"

"No; none that I ever saw."

"And your home?"

"I have none."

"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"

"I have no brothers or sisters."

"Who recommended you to come here?"

"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."

"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to Adèle."

"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester: "eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She began by felling my horse."

"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.

"I have to thank her for this sprain."

The widow looked bewildered.

"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"

"No, sir."

"Have you seen much society?"

"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield."

"Have you read much?"

"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned."

"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms; Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?"

"Yes, sir."

"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director."

"Oh, no."

"You are very cool! No! What! A novice not worship her priest! That sounds blasphemous."

"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew."

"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue.

"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.Rochester.

"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed."

"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"

"About ten."

"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"

I assented.

"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?"

"A little."

"Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—I mean, if you please. Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,' and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate. Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."

I departed, obeying his directions.

"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes. "You play a little, I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well."

I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued—

"Adèle showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours. I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"

"No, indeed!" I interjected.

"Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patchwork."

"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."

I brought the portfolio from the library.

"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Adèle and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.

"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine." He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.

"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at them with Adèle; you (glancing at me) resume your seat, and answer my questions. I perceive these pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?"

"Yes."

"And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and some thought."

"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other occupation."

"Where did you get your copies?"

"Out of my head."

"That head I see now on your shoulders?"

"Yes, sir."

"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"

"I should think it may have: I should hope—better."

He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.

While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.

These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land.One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.

The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.

The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."

"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr.Rochester presently.

"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."

"That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I dare say you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?"

"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."

"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"

"Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise."

"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a schoolgirl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind. There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos.There—put the drawings away!"

I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, he said abruptly—

"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adèle sit up so long? Take her to bed."

Adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.

"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.

"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.

"Well, is he?"

"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."

"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made."

"Why?"

"Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits unequal."

"What about?"

"Family troubles, for one thing."

"But he has no family."

"Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder brother a few years since."

"His elder brother?"

"Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years."

"Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss?"

"Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."

"Why should he shun it?"

"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."

The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. She averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.





CHAPTER XIV


For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.

During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.

One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs. I brushed Adèle's hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended, Adèle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.

"Ma bo te! Ma bo te!" exclaimed she, running towards it.

"Yes, there is your 'bo te' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. "And mind," he continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"

Adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had already retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—

"Oh, Ciel! Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation.

"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.

"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here." He drew a chair near his own. "I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp.It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening tête-à-tête with a brat.Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them.Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-by, I must have mine in mind; it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water."

He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand.

"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have forbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed."

Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her "bo te"; pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.

"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester, "put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do."

I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.

We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.

Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less gloomy.There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.

He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.

"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"

I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware—

"No, sir."

"Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet—except, by-the-by, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance—; and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean by it?"

"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort."

"You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"

"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder."

"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me: does my forehead not please you?"

He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.

"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"

"Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?"

"There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience"; and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart.When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an indiarubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?"

"Hope of what, sir?"

"Of my final re-transformation from indiarubber back to flesh?"

"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed?

"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative tonight."

With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.

"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative tonight," he repeated, "and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk. Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here. I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but tonight I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out—to learn more of you—therefore speak."

Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.

"Speak," he urged.

"What about, sir?"

"Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself."

Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person," I thought.

"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."

I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.

"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an inferior: that is (correcting himself), I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's advance in experience. This is legitimate, et j'y tiens , as Adèle would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a rusty nail."

He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.

"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them."

"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?"

"Do as you please, sir."

"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive one. Reply clearly."

"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience."

"Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won't allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?"

I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar—he seems to forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.

"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing expression; "but speak too."

"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders."

"Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?"

"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily."

"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"

"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary."

"Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant. However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done. But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points."

"And so may you," I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined—

"Yes, yes, you are right," said he. "I have plenty of faults of my own: I know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I started, or rather—for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances—was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one and twenty, and have never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as good as you—wiser—almost as stainless. I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"

"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"

"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal. Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don't see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-by, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).Then take my word for it—I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite, commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you wonder that I avow this to you? Know that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."

"How do you know? How can you guess all this, sir?"

"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was not. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool; I turned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do! Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre: remorse is the poison of life."

"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."

"It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I will get it, cost what it may."

"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."

"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor."

"It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir."

"How do you know?—you never tried it. How very serious—how very solemn you look; and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head (taking one from the mantelpiece). You have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries."

"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."

"And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flitted across my brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that. Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart."

"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."

"Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?"

"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it."

"Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"

He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.

"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim—a disguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done me good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."

"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection; one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with pleasure."

"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am paving hell with energy."

"Sir?"

"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been."

"And better?"

"And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that both are right."

"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalize them."

"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."

"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse."

"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it."

"You are human and fallible."

"I am: so are you—what then?" "The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."

"What power?"

"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action, 'Let it be right.'"

"'Let it be right'—the very words: you have pronounced them."

"May it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.

"Where are you going?"

"To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime."

"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a sphynx."

"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly not afraid."

"You are afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder."

"In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense."

"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don't trouble yourself to answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly; but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high. You are still bent on going?"

"It has struck nine, sir."

"Never mind, wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet. My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adèle. I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study, reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day. She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. 'Il faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et à l'instant même!' and she rushed out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will reenter; and I know what I shall see—a miniature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of—but never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realized."

Ere long, Adèle's little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.

"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"

And spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tiptoe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—

"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;" then rising, she added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"

"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English gold out of my British breeches' pocket. I have been green, too, miss Eyre—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I'll explain all this some day. Good-night."





CHAPTER XV


Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and her shuttle-cock, he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.

He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "grande passion". This passion Céline had professed to return with even superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he believed, as he said, that she preferred his "taille d'athlète" to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.

"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, etc. In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Céline did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No—I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar—I will take one now, if you will excuse me."

Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on—

"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was croquant—overlook the barbarism—croquant chocolate comfits, and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I had given Céline. She was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame—that is the very word for an opera inammorata— alighted: though muffed in a cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-by, on so warm a June evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur 'Mon ange'—in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched porte cochere of the hotel.

"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I tell you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master wave into a calmer current—as I am now.

"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-house? How I do still abhor—"

He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.

We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified his countenance: he went on—

"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. 'You like Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can! Like it if you dare!'

"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and (he subjoined moodily) I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness—yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hinderances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood."

Adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock. "Away!" he cried harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!" Continuing then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point whence he had abruptly diverged—

"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle Varens entered?"

I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. "Oh, I had forgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core. Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point. "Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistress to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me." After this digression he proceeded—

"I remained in the balcony. 'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,' thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.' So putting my hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens' shining in satin and jewels, my gifts of course, and there was her companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On recognizing him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.

"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my 'beauté mâle': wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—"

Adèle here came running up again.

"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you."

"Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this fillette Adèle, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess, etc.—eh?"

"No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense, parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"

"Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens."

But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttle-cock. When we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.

It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to him, were everyday matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.

I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were characterized); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.

The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to him.I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.

And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features.But I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say former, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.

Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at Thornfield.

"Why not?" I asked myself. "What alienates him from the house? Will he leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks. If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"

I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.

I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I said, "Who is there?" Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.

All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.

This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is there?"

Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.

"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.

Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.

"Wake! wake!" I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.

The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last. Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of water.

"Is there a flood?" he cried.

"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."

"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he demanded. "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?"

"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up. Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."

"There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, here is my dressing-gown. Now run!"

I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.

"What is it? And who did it?" he asked. I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.

He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.

"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.

"Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she do? Let her sleep unmolested."

"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."

"Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the third storey. Don't move, remember, or call any one."

He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. "I hope it is he," thought I, "and not something worse."

He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. "I have found it all out," said he, setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."

"How, sir?"

He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone—

"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door."

"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."

"But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should think, or something like it?"

"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole—she laughs in that way. She is a singular person."

"Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say, singular—very well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night's incident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs (pointing to the bed): and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four—in two hours the servants will be up."

"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.

He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to go.

"What!" he exclaimed, "Are you quitting me already, and in that way?"

"You said I might go, sir."

"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.Why, you have saved my life—snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death! And you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands."

He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in both his own.

"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."

He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips—but his voice was checked.

"Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case."

"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some time; I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did not—(again he stopped)—did not (he proceeded hastily) strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!"

Strange energy was in his voice; strange fire in his look.

"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said; and then I was going.

"What! you will go?"

"I am cold, sir."

"Cold? Yes, and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!" But he still retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an expedient.

"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.

"Well, leave me." he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.

I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.





CHAPTER XVI


I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.

But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adèle's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's—that is, John's wife—and even John's own gruff tones. There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!" "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night." "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!" "I wonder he waked nobody!" "It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa." etc.

To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.

There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was amazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said "Good morning, miss," in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.

"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension."

"Good morning, Grace," I said. "Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago."

"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.

"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly, "Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?"

She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she answered—

"The servants sleep so far off, you know, miss, they would not be likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but Mrs.Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy." She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone—"But you are young, miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?"

"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."

She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—

"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, miss, when he was in such danger: you must have been dreaming."

"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinizing and conscious eye.

"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.

"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."

"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?" she further asked.

She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.

"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."

"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?"

"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!" Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary.I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future (and I laid marked stress on the words) I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down."

"It will be wise so to do," was her answer, "this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, though he often blesses them when they are used discreetly." And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.

I still stood absolutely dumbfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.

"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon be ready: will you come down?"

"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll carry it upstairs."

"You'll have some meat?"

"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."

"And the sago?"

"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before tea-time: I'll make it myself."

The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me: so I departed.

I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's service. He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.

Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could not be admitted. "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I don't think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?" But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"

I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom: Adèle was drawing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.

"Qu'avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she; "vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"

"I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!" She went on sketching; I went on thinking.

I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.

"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window. "I have never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house today; but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient."

When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed tonight, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.

A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room. Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.

"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate so little at dinner. I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well today: you look flushed and feverish."

"Oh, quite well! I never felt better."

"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the teapot while I knit off this needle?" Having completed her task, she rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity.

"It is fair tonight," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for his journey."

"Journey! Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out."

"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He has gone to the Leas, Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote: I believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others."

"Do you expect him back tonight?"

"No—nor tomorrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look."

"Are there ladies at the Leas?"

"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a Christmas ball and party Mr.Rochester gave. You should have seen the dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening."

"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"

"Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen."

"And what was she like?"

"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls."

"She was greatly admired, of course?"

"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."

"Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing."

"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."

"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"

"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen to her; and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but Mr.Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."

"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"

"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large fortunes. Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the eldest son came in for everything almost."

"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?"

"Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."

"What of that? More unequal matches are made every day."

"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you began tea."

"No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?"

I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the conversation was turned into another channel.

When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.

Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the ideal; I pronounced judgment to this effect:

That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.

"You," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted with the power of pleasing him? You of importance to him in any way? Go! Your folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid dupe!Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night? Cover your face and be ashamed!He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.

"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: tomorrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.'

"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye; what! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no sentiment!—no regret!I will endure only sense and resolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.'

"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"

"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew calm, and fell asleep.

I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.

Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even externally.





CHAPTER XVII


A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester; ten days, and still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said—

"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised."

I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.

Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.

"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction. "Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."

And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer, I did not choose to consider.

"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the note before her spectacles.

Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Adèle's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—

"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"

"Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either. I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it." And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.

The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since. Adèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes" as she called frocks; to furbish up any that were "passees", and to air and arrange the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.

The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms—just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself—as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.

The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—

"She gets good wages, I guess?"

"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of—there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business."

"She is a good hand, I dare say," said the charwoman.

"Ah!—she understands what she has to do—nobody better," rejoined Leah significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for all the money she gets."

"That it is not!" was the reply. "I wonder whether the master—"

The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and she instantly gave her companion a nudge.

"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.

Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.All I had gathered from it amounted to this—that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.

Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them.The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.

Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the company—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, etc. Adèle, too, would be dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least.However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me—"a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."

It had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.

"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. "I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote." She went to the window. "Here he is!" said she. "Well, John (leaning out), any news?"

"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer. "They'll be here in ten minutes."

Adèle flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.

The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.

"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.

The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adèle now petitioned to go down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, etc. "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.

A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.

"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adèle; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement; and she sighed.

"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je les suivais partout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'étaìt si amusant: comme cela on apprend."

"Don't you feel hungry, Adèle?"

"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voilà cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas mangé."

"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and get you something to eat."

And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants' hall two coachmen and three gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the Abigails I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victuallage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.

Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.

I found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar. "What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English. "Oh, I wish I might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-by, after dinner?"

"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.Never mind the ladies tonight; perhaps you will see them tomorrow: here is your dinner."

She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after nine and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about.Besides, she added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors quel dommage!"

I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Adèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.

The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.

The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me—

"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I, "but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies."

"Yes, I dare say: no doubt he admires her."

"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have never had a glimpse of it yet."

"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax. "I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adèle wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"

"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I answered.

"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and he replied, in his quick way, 'Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy.'"

"I will not give him that trouble," I answered. "I will go, if no better may be; but I don't like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"

"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I'll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go into the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you."

"Will these people remain long, do you think?"

"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take his seat; I dare say Mr. Rochester will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield."

It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adèle had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.This I quickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.

Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.

Adèle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read. Adèle brought her stool to my feet; ere long she touched my knee.

"What is it, Adèle?"

"Est-ceque je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette."

"You think too much of your 'toilette', Adèle: but you may have a flower." And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full.I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.

A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them. There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.

They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.

First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: , and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term mìnoìs chìffonné: both sisters were fair as lilies.

Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.

Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.

But the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine; her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical—very intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a truly imperial dignity.

Blanche and Mary were of equal stature—straight and tall as poplars.Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly—it will out!—whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.

As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there; but her face? Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip.

Genius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent.It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones"; Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed) trailing Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her ignorance—her trail might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice was fine; she talked French apart to her mama; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.

Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression, her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat, remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.

And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female beauty.If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that he did admire her, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.

You are not to suppose, reader, that Adèle has all this time been sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity—

"Bon jour, mesdames."

And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed, "Oh, what a little puppet!"

Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose—the little French girl he was speaking of."

Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.

Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—

"What a love of a child!"

And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.

At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a "père noble de the tre." Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.

And where is Mr. Rochester?

He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me. I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.

No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.

Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer." My master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth—all energy, decision, will—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.

I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram—even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile—his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is not of their kind. I believe he is of mine—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand the language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me.For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered—and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him."

Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr.Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir George—whom, by-the-by, I have forgotten to describe—a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adèle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself selects a mate.

Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.

"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"

"Nor am I."

"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that? (pointing to Adèle) Where did you pick her up?"

"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."

"You should have sent her to school."

"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."

"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just now—is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-curtain.You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as expensive—more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."

I feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make Mr.Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never turned his eyes.

"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking straight before him.

"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi—were they not, mama?"

"Did you speak, my own?"

The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated her question with an explanation.

"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!"

Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the anathematised race was present.

"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!" Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."

"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.

"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban three times with portentous significancy.

"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."

"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."

"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the whole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"

"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram: "and the poor old stick used to cry out 'Oh you vilains childs!'—and then we sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she was herself so ignorant."

"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting—or persecuting—your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle passion', and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did you not, my lady-mother?"

"Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—"

"Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste, we all know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence accompanying—mutiny and general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"

"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."

"Then no more need be said: change the subject."

Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"

"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured, she would give us anything we asked for."

"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic. Mr.Rochester, do you second my motion?"

"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."

"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are you in voice tonight?"

"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."

"Then, Signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."

"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"

"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as she moved to the piano. "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand."

"Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried Mr. Rochester.

"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.

"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.

Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high horse tonight; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.

"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she, rattling away at the instrument. "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's permission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage! I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the gentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their motto be—hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a filip. Such should be my device, were I a man."

"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted, "I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."

"I am all obedience," was the response.

"Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that reason, sing it con spirito."

"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and water."

"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how such things should be done."

"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to fail."

"Gardez-vous-en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate punishment."

"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."

"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.

"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment."

"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.

"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: he did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near. Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.

"How do you do?" he asked.

"I am very well, sir."

"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"

I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I would not take that freedom. I answered—

"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."

"What have you been doing during my absence?"

"Nothing particular; teaching Adèle as usual."

"And getting a good deal paler than you were—as I saw at first sight.What is the matter?"

"Nothing at all, sir."

"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"

"Not the least."

"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."

"I am tired, sir." He looked at me for a minute.

"And a little depressed," he said. "What about? Tell me."

"Nothing—nothing, sir. I am not depressed."

"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes—indeed, they are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means. Well, tonight I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adèle. Good-night, my—" he stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.





CHAPTER XVIII


Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.

The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.

I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades", but in my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, etc., were brought down in armfuls by the Abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.

Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. "Miss Ingram is mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.

"Will you play?" he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.

He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.

"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."

Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out—

"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.

A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a large marble basin—which I recognized as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.

Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes and swarth skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very model of an eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to represent.

She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost her; to make some request: "She hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink." From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.

The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated. Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole"; whereupon the curtain again descended.

On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.

Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were attached fetters.

"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.

A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.

"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"

"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.

"Alas! yes: the more's the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your complexion than that ruffian's rouge."

"You would like a hero of the road then?"

"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."

"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses." She giggled, and her colour rose.

"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn." And as the other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs. What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.

I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.

There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous, or very rarely; the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy; she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain arose.

I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons, because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve was touched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: she could not charm him.

If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers—jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my admiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence. But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—herself unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what she wished to allure—to witness this, was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.

Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye, and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.

"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so near to him?" I asked myself. "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when they are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on."

I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, etc., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act.

But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their nature.

Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride—saw only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their movements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with their own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good−natured Mrs.Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me.Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of the Misses Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected with him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.

The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.

It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—

"Voilà, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"

I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.

"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram. "He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot was with him—what has he done with the animals?"

As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement. The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.

"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey! (apostrophizing Adèle) Who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.

Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered. He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.

"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to install myself here till he returns."

His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat unusual—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's—between thirty and forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to please. His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life—at least so I thought.

The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease. But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.

As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.

He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that "extremes meet".

Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they both called him "a beautiful man". Louisa said he was "a love of a creature", and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.

"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa, "so smooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such a placid eye and smile!"

And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.

I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.

I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near Mr.Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, "old woman,"—"quite troublesome."

"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself off," replied the magistrate.

"No—stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent. "Don't send her away, Eshton; we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies." And speaking aloud, he continued—"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought in before 'the quality', to tell them their fortunes. Would you like to see her?"

"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"

"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."

"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.

"'To tell the gentry their fortunes' she says, ma'am; and she swears she must and will do it."

"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.

"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."

"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn. "Let us have her in, of course."

"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to throw away such a chance of fun."

"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.

"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed in the Dowager Ingram.

"Indeed, mama, but you can—and will," pronounced the haughty voice of Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. "I have a curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame forward."

"My darling Blanche! recollect—"

"I do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will—quick, Sam!"

"Yes—yes—yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. "Let her come—it will be excellent sport!"

The footman still lingered. "She looks such a rough one," said he.

"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.

Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.

"She won't come now," said he. "She says it's not her mission to appear before the 'vulgar herd' (them're her words). I must show her into a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by one."

"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches. Be advised, my angel girl—and—"

"Show her into the library, of course," "cut in the angel girl." "It is not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?"

"Yes, ma'am—but she looks such a tinkler."

"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."

Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow once more.

"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.

"She wishes to know who will be her first visitor."

"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go," said Colonel Dent.

"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."

Sam went and returned.

"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."

"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.

Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his men.

"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!" was her mama's cry; but she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.

A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it "Le cas" to wring her hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their breath, and looked a little frightened. The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.

Would she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.

"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.

"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.

"What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?" demanded the Misses Eshton.

"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem, by the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to this matter—absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a gipsy-vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is gratified; and now I think Mr.Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks tomorrow morning, as he threatened."

Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further conversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She had obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself, notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her.

Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.

Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.

"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all. "She told us such things! She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.

Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of things they had said and done when they were mere children; described books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what they most wished for.

Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity. The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.

In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and saw Sam.

"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it. What shall I tell her?"

"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered; and I was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped out of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door quietly behind me.

"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she frightens you, just call and I'll come in."

"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid." Nor was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.





CHAPTER XIX


The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the sibyl—if sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a Prayer Book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.

I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm. She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.

"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided as her glance, as harsh as her features.

"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn you, I have no faith."

"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold."

"Did you? You've a quick ear."

"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."

"You need them all in your trade."

"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with. Why don't you tremble?"

"I'm not cold."

"Why don't you turn pale?"

"I am not sick."

"Why don't you consult my art?"

"I'm not silly."

The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately—

"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."

"Prove it," I rejoined.

"I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you.You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you."

She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking with vigour.

"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great house."

"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any one?"

"In my circumstances."

"Yes; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another precisely placed as you are."

"It would be easy to find you thousands."

"You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. Chance laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."

"I don't understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life."

"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."

"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"

"To be sure." I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she told me to hold out my hand. I did. She ached her face to the palm, and pored over it without touching it.

"It is too fine," said she. "I can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not written there."

"I believe you," said I.

"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head."

"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her. "I shall begin to put some faith in you presently." I knelt within half a yard of her.She stirred the fire, so that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.

"I wonder with what feelings you came to me tonight," she said, when she had examined me a while. "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."

"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."

"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?"

"Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."

"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-seat (you see I know your habits) —"

"You have learned them from the servants."

"Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I have an acquaintance with one of them—Mrs. Poole—"

I started to my feet when I heard the name.

"You have—have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business after all, then!"

"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"

"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."

"But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?"

"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it amuses me to watch them."

"What tale do you like best to hear?"

"Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage."

"And do you like that monotonous theme?"

"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."

"Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—"

"I what?"

"You know—and perhaps think well of."

"I don't know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."

"You don't know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the house!"

"He is not at home."

"A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here tonight or tomorrow: does that circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him, as it were, out of existence?"

"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had introduced."

"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"

"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."

"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?"

"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator." I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.

"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have noticed this?"

"Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."

"Detecting! You have analyzed, then. And what did you detect, if not gratitude?"

I said nothing.

"You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?"

"Humph! Not exactly. Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."

"What the devil have you seen, then?"

"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr.Rochester is to be married?"

"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."

"Shortly?"

"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not his person, at least his purse. I know she considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch. I would advise her black-aviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll—he's dished—"

"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."

"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study.Kneel again on the rug."

"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."

I knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair. She began muttering—

"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made—to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.

"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I dare say it would be silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor.That feature, too, is propitious.

"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say—'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.' The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.'

"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood—no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet—that will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength.Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out."

Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream still? The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before. Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me—on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.

"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.

"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—"

"But the string is in a knot—help me."

"Break it, sir."

"There, then—'Off, ye lendings!'" And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his disguise.

"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"

"But well carried out, eh? Don't you think so?"

"With the ladies you must have managed well."

"But not with you?"

"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."

"What character did I act? My own?"

"No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying to draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir."

"Do you forgive me, Jane?"

"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not right."

"Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible."

I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but, indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview.Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to conceal her features.But my mind had been running on Grace Poole—that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her. I had never thought of Mr.Rochester.

"Well," said he, "what are you musing about? What does that grave smile signify?"

"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire now, I suppose?"

"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are doing."

"Discussing the gipsy, I dare say."

"Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me."

"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock. Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this morning?"

"A stranger!—no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he gone?"

"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of installing himself here till you returned."

"The devil he did! Did he give his name?"

"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think."

Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead me to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.

"Mason!—the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!—the West Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly seemed to know what he was doing.

"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.

"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"

He staggered.

"Oh, lean on me, sir."

"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."

"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."

He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary look.

"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."

"Can I help you, sir?—I'd give my life to serve you."

"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."

"Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do—I'll try, at least, to do it."

"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is doing."

I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester had said; they were not seated at table—the supper was arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and animated. Mr.Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a liberty, I dare say), and I returned to the library.

Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand.

"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said. He swallowed the contents and returned it to me. "What are they doing, Jane?"

"Laughing and talking, sir."

"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?"

"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."

"And Mason?"

"He was laughing too."

"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do, Jane?"

"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."

He half smiled. "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?"

"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with you."

"To comfort me?"

"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."

"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"

"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should care nothing about it."

"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"

"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as you, I am sure, do."

"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then leave me."

"Yes, sir."

I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.

At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."

He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon asleep.





CHAPTER XX


I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silverwhite and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.

Good God! What a cry!

The night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.

My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.

It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted—

"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.

"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:

"Rochester! Rochester! for God's sake, come!"

A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there was silence.

I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"—"Who is hurt?"—"What has happened?"—"Fetch a light!"—"Is it fire?"—"Are there robbers?"—"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands. But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.

"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent. "I cannot find him in his bed."

"Here! here!" was shouted in return. "Be composed, all of you: I'm coming."

And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey. One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.

"What awful event has taken place?" said she. "Speak! let us know the worst at once!"

"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.

"All's right! All's right!" he cried. "It's a mere rehearsal of 'Much Ado About Nothing'. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."

And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself by an effort, he added—

"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She's an excitable, nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after.Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames (to the dowagers), you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."

And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.

Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.

No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was. I left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.

"Am I wanted?" I asked.

"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, namely, my master's.

"Yes, sir."

"And dressed?"

"Yes."

"Come out, then, quietly."

I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.

"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no noise."

My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his side.

"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.

"Yes, sir."

"Have you any salts—volatile salts?"

"Yes."

"Go back and fetch both."

I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer, and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock; he paused, and addressed me again.

"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"

"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."

I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.

"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting fit."

I put my fingers into his. "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned the key and opened the door.

I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out of the room within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog quarrelling. Mr.Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's own goblin ha! ha! she then was there. He made some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he came out and closed the door behind him.

"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it, dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant back; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I recognized in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason: I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in blood.

"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin of water from the washstand: "hold that," said he. I obeyed. He took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.

"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.

"Pooh! No—a mere scratch. Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!I'll fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by morning, I hope. Jane—" he continued.

"Sir?"

"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to him on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I'll not answer for the consequences."

Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear, either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyze him. Mr.Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then saying, "Remember!—no conversation," he left the room. I experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard.

Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon me.

I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.

According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his subordinate's form.

Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side-den. But since Mr.Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but three sounds at three long intervals—a step creak, a momentary renewal of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.

Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner? What mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?

And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here! And why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival? Why had the mere name of this unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on an oak?

Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered: "Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane." I could not forget how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.

"When will he come? When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.

The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed shorter.

Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.

"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but half an hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the patient downstairs and all."

"But is he fit to move, sir?"

"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must be kept up. Come, set to work."

Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.

"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.

"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.

"Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all! Carter, assure him there's no danger."

"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have bled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well as cut.This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth here!"

"She bit me," he murmured. "She worried me like a tigress, when Rochester got the knife from her."

"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once," said Mr. Rochester.

"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason. "Oh, it was frightful!" he added, shuddering. "And I did not expect it: she looked so quiet at first."

"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said—be on your guard when you go near her. Besides, you might have waited till tomorrow, and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview tonight, and alone."

"I thought I could have done some good."

"You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not taking my advice; so I'll say no more. Carter—hurry!—hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off."

"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."

"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.

I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only said—

"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat it."

"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.

"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not think of her at all."

"Impossible to forget this night!"

"It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a trice. Jane (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance), take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."

I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named, and returned with them.

"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."

I retired as directed.

"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.Rochester presently.

"No, sir; all was very still."

"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here, Carter, help him on with his waist-coat. Where did you leave your furred cloak? You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold climate. In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room, the one next mine, and fetch a cloak you will see there."

Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur.

"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a little glass you will find there—quick!"

I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.

"That's well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance.Jane, a little water."

He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the waterbottle on the washstand.

"That will do—now wet the lip of the phial."

I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to Mason. "Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."

"But will it hurt me—is it inflammatory?"

"Drink! drink! drink!"

Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied. Mr.Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the liquid; he then took his arm—

"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said; "try."

The patient rose.

"Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard; step out—that's it!"

"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.

"I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt the side passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive his rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."

It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The sidepassage door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box, stationed outside. I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.

The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the chaise; Carter followed.

"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to see how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?"

"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."

"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye, Dick."

"Fairfax—"

"Well what is it?"

"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let her—" he stopped and burst into tears.

"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.

"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.

This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!" He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.

"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"

"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."

"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now here (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered), all is real, sweet, and pure."

He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.

"Jane, will you have a flower?"

He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to me.

"Thank you, sir."

"Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid and balmly atmosphere?"

"I do, very much."

"You have passed a strange night, Jane."

"Yes, sir."

"And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone with Mason?"

"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."

"But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."

"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"

"Oh yes! Don't trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your thoughts."

"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."

"Never fear—I will take care of myself."

"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"

"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then. To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any day."

"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you." "Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."

"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to avert the danger."

He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it from him.

"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done. But I cannot give him orders in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard'; for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are my little friend, are you not?"

"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."

"Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me—working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, 'all that is right': for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star. Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix me at once."

"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir, you are very safe."

"God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."

The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him.

"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two. You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?"

I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.

"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their first spell of work—I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."

"No, sir; I am content."

"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy—suppose you were no longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence. Mind, I don't say a crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves?"

He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.

Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:

"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant man justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own peace of mind and regeneration of life?"

"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die; philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to amend and solace to heal."

"But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the instrument. I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for my cure, in—"

He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes—so long was the silence protracted. At last I looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.

"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and sarcastic—"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"

He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he came back he was humming a tune.

"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"

"Curse you? No, sir."

"Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious chamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?"

"Whenever I can be useful, sir."

"For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company? To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."

"Yes, sir."

"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"

"Yes, sir."

"A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there's Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."

As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying cheerfully—

"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise: I rose at four to see him off."





CHAPTER XXI


Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.

When I was a little girl, only six years old, I, one night, heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there.The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.

Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.

I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.

"I dare say you hardly remember me, miss," he said, rising as I entered; "but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."

"Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how is Bessie? You are married to Bessie?"

"Yes, miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another little one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and child are thriving."

"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"

"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, miss: they are very badly at present—in great trouble."

"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress. He too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied—

"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."

"Mr. John?"

"Yes."

"And how does his mother bear it?"

"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and his death was shocking."

"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."

"Doing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him.Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself."

I was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed—

"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, 'Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.' Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you.The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times, that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, miss, I should like to take you back with me early tomorrow morning."

"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."

"I think so too, miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"

"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants' hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.

He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes: she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr.Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a low voice, "Mr. Rochester, "she made a movement as if tempted to order me away. I remember her appearance at the moment—it was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments.

"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the "person" was. He made a curious grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his cue and followed me from the room.

"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which he had shut.

"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."

"What to do? —where to go?"

"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."

"What sick lady? Where does she live?"

"At Gateshead; in —shire."

"—shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for people to see her that distance?"

"Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed."

"Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."

"It is his widow, sir."

"And what have you to do with her? How do you know her?"

"Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother's brother."

"The deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no relations."

"None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me off."

"Why?"

"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."

"But Reed left children?—you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London."

"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."

"And what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."

"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."

"How long will you stay?"

"As short a time as possible, sir."

"Promise me only to stay a week—"

"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."

"At all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"

"Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well."

"And who goes with you? You don't travel a hundred miles alone."

"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."

"A person to be trusted?"

"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."

Mr. Rochester meditated.

"When do you wish to go?"

"Early tomorrow morning, sir."

"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I dare say you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.

I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. "Five shillings, sir." He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocketbook: "Here," said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen. I told him I had no change.

"I don't want change; you know that. Take your wages."

I declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, he said—

"Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not plenty?"

"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."

"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."

"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity."

"Matter of business? I am curious to hear it."

"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?"

"Yes; what then?"

"In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it."

"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically? There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it: Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to—the devil?"

"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."

"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.

"And old Madam Reed, or the misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?"

"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of them—but I shall advertise."

"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled. "At your peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."

"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind me. "I could not spare the money on any account."

"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request! Give me five pounds, Jane."

"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."

"Just let me look at the cash."

"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."

"Jane!"

"Sir?"

"Promise me one thing."

"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."

"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I'll find you one in time."

"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it."

"Very well! Very well! I'll pledge my word on it. You go tomorrow, then?"

"Yes, sir; early."

"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"

"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."

"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"

"I suppose so, sir."

"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me; I'm not quite up to it."

"They say farewell; or any other form they prefer."

"Then say it."

"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."

"What must I say?"

"The same, if you like, sir."

"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"

"Yes?"

"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like something else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for instance; but no—that would not content me either. So you'll do no more than say 'farewell', Jane?"

"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many."

"Very likely; but it is blank and cool—farewell."

"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked myself; "I want to commence my packing." The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.

I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her last−born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.

"Bless you!—I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.

"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too late. How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope."

"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she will finally recover."

"Has she mentioned me lately?"

"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, miss, and then I will go up with you?"

Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.

Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good looks.

Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.

She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master, whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.

In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my bonnet, etc., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall. It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.

"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."

In another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth.Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's History of British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.

Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.

The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as wax-work, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her sister's—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as the other's looked puritanical.

In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.

Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the name of "Miss Eyre". Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her "How d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet.Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.

A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.

"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty.

"Mrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see her tonight."

"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I should be much obliged to you."

Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. "I know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."

"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza. I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not tonight. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been today, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her daughters' pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.

"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let us see if she will know you."

I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilettable, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.

Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.

The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.

"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.

"Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?"

I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated.Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling towards me—was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony eye—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.

I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.

"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on."

"Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?"

"Yes."

"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: tonight it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to say—let me see—"

The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated.

"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane Eyre?"

"I am Jane Eyre."

"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, did not die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!"

"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"

"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long—not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers—he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money? I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off. I can never submit to do that—yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages.John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I feel ashamed for him when I see him."

She was getting much excited. "I think I had better leave her now," said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.

"Perhaps you had, miss: but she often talks in this way towards night—in the morning she is calmer."

I rose. "Stop!" exclaimed mrs. Reed. "There is another thing I wished to say. He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?"

Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.

More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me for both.

Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.

One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large. "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit"; and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend's face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.

"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man". They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour.She proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day in her mother's sick-room, and no more.

Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she said "the Rubric". Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.

She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.

Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had had. She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.

Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town. "It would be so much better," she said, "if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over." I did not ask what she meant by "all being over", but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—

"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life. Instead of living for, in and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do.Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be. I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.After my mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new."

She closed her lips.

"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade, "answered Georgiana. "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever." Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.

True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.

It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day service at the new church—for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.

I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.

The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: "One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its material tenement—flit when at length released?"

In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls.I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid death-bed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom—when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind, "Who is that?"

I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up to her.

"It is I, Aunt Reed."

"Who—I?" was her answer. "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. "You are quite a stranger to me—where is Bessie?"

"She is at the lodge, aunt."

"Aunt," she repeated. "Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!"

I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity.

"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed." I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.

"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long. "I was trying to turn myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?"

I assured her we were alone.

"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other—" she stopped. "After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."

She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed; she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.

"Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell her. Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there."

I obeyed her directions. "Read the letter." she said.

It was short, and thus conceived—





"Madam,

Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.

I am, madam, etc., etc.

JOHN EYRE, Madeira."





It was dated three years back.

"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.

"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man's voice. Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!"

"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required, "think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day."

She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath, she went on thus—

"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."

"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness—"

"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend."

"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt."

I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I laid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.

"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."

Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me—dying, she must hate me still.

The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered halfan hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o'clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me.I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her woes—not my loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.

Eliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she observed—

"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble." And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.





CHAPTER XXII


Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that while I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part."

At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention, she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.

One morning she told me I was at liberty. "And," she added, "I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There is some difference between living with such a one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one. Tomorrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent. I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil."

I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it. "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much good may it do you!"

When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you have some sense."

I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent.However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't much care."

"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her fortune.

How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.

My journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analyzed their separate peculiarities of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of—scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.

I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a fortnight.Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place. "You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment. "I don't doubt it."

The question followed, "Where was I to go?" I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both her and me.

I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.

It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it—it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.

I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival. "Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I, "and little Adèle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."

But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience? These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they added—"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!" And then I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on.

They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.

Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.

"Hello!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. "There you are! Come on, if you please."

I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure.

"And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? Yes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?"

"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."

"A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I'd touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh. Truant! truant!" he added, when he had paused an instant. "Absent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"

I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially. His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home—would that it were my home!

He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I inquired soon if he had not been to London.

"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."

"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."

"And did she inform you what I went to do?"

"Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand."

"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally. Tell me now, fairy as you are—can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"

"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "a loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."

Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he shed it over me now.

"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."

All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to colloquize further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. I said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—

"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only home."

I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried. Little Adèle was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs. Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee. This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.

I, that evening, shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my cars against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adèle, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter back again, and added that he saw Adèle was "prête à croquer sa petite maman Anglaise"—I half ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.

A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.

One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds. I used to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never had I loved him so well.





CHAPTER XXIII


A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour, even singly, our wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.

On Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.

It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four. "Day its fervid fires had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit. Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.

I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen.While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed—not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.

Sweet-briar and southern-wood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—Mr. Rochester's cigar. I look round and listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.

But no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.

"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."

I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. "I shall get by very well," I meditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without turning—

"Jane, come and look at this fellow."

I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel? I started at first, and then I approached him.

"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England: there! He is flown."

The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said—

"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise."

It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.

"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, "Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"

"Yes, sir."

"You must have become in some degree attached to the house—you, who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?"

"I am attached to it, indeed."

"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?"

"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."

"And would be sorry to part with them?"

"Yes."

"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused. "It is always the way of events in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired."

"Must I move on, sir?" I asked. "Must I leave Thornfield?"

"I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must."

This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.

"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."

"It is come now—I must give it tonight."

"Then you are going to be married, sir?"

"Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail straight on the head."

"Soon, sir?"

"Very soon, my—that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short—she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the point: one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche—well, as I was saying—listen to me, Jane! You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you? That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away home.' I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with that discretion I respect in you—with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position—that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adèle had better trot forthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have made it my law of action. Adèle must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation."

"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—"I was going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.

"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester; "and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you."

"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give—"

"Oh, no need to apologize! I consider that when a dependent does her duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs.Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."

"It is a long way off, sir."

"No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance."

"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—"

"From what, Jane?"

"From England and from Thornfield: and—"

"Well?"

"From you, sir." I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved.

"It is a long way," I again said.

"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain. I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"

"Yes, sir."

"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half an hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit there in peace tonight, though we should never more be destined to sit there together."

He seated me and himself.

"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"

I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.

"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you—you'd forget me."

"That I never should, sir: you know—" Impossible to proceed.

"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!"

In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.

"Because you are sorry to leave it?"

The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes—and to speak.

"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield—I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life—momentarily at least. I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in—with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death."

"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.

"Where? You, sir, have placed it before me."

"In what shape?"

"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman—your bride."

"My bride! What bride? I have no bride!"

"But you will have."

"Yes—I will!—I will!" He set his teeth.

"Then I must go—you have said it yourself."

"No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept."

"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion. "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as you—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal—as we are!"

"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester—"so," he added, enclosing me in his arms. Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so, Jane!"

"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you—to one with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you—let me go!"

"Where, Jane? To Ireland?"

"Yes—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."

"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation."

"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you."

Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.

"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions."

"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."

"I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and best earthly companion."

"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."

"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too."

A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite distance—it died. The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said—

"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."

"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return."

"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."

I was silent: I thought he mocked me.

"Come, Jane—come hither."

"Your bride stands between us."

He rose, and with a stride reached me.

"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?"

Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I was still incredulous.

"Do you doubt me, Jane?"

"Entirely."

"You have no faith in me?"

"Not a whit."

"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately. "Little sceptic, you shall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not—I could not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost unearthly thing!—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband."

"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness—and especially in his incivility—to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the world but you—if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have given me?"

"You, Jane, I must have you for my own—entirely my own. Will you be mine? Say yes, quickly."

"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."

"Why?"

"Because I want to read your countenance—turn!"

"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."

His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.

"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed. "With that searching and yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!"

"How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture."

"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly—"Jane, accept me quickly. Say, Edward—give me my name—Edward—I will marry you."

"Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife?"

"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."

"Then, sir, I will marry you."

"Edward—my little wife!"

"Dear Edward!"

"Come to me—come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "make my happiness—I will make yours."

"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I have her, and will hold her."

"There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere."

"No—that is the best of it," he said. And if I had loved him less I should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but, sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the paradise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow.Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?" And again and again I answered, "Yes." After which he murmured, "It will atone—it will atone.Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at God's tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world's judgment—I wash my hands thereof. For man's opinion—I defy it."

But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was. And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.

"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes. I could have sat with thee till morning, Jane."

"And so," thought I, "could I with you." I should have said so, perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.

The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold.He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room. I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester. The lamp was lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.

"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-night—good-night, my darling!"

He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, and ran upstairs. "Explanation will do for another time," thought I. Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen. But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was strength for anything.

Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adèle came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.





CHAPTER XXIV


As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr.Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.

While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.

I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.

Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad countenance, and saying gravely—"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?" During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her then.I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met Adèle leaving the schoolroom.

"Where are you going? It is time for lessons."

"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."

"Where is he?"

"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and there he stood.

"Come and bid me good-morning," said he. I gladly advanced; and it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.

"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?" (I had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were new-dyed, I suppose.)

"It is Jane Eyre, sir."

"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day more. Do you hear that?"

I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than was consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned. It was, I think almost fear.

"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"

"Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems so strange."

"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax Rochester's girl-bride."

"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is a fairy tale—a day-dream."

"Which I can and will realize. I shall begin today. This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his keeping—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."

"Oh, sir!—never mind jewels! I don't like to hear them spoken of.Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not have them."

"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on your forehead—which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairylike fingers with rings."

"No, no, sir! Think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in another strain. Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain, Quakerish governess."

"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my heart—delicate and aerial."

"Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir—or you are sneering. For God's sake don't be ironical!"

"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. "I will attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."

"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane eyre any longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes.I would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you. Don't flatter me."

He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. "This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be married in four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town. After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."

"Shall I travel?—and with you, sir?"

"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also. Ten years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel as my comforter."

I laughed at him as he said this. "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me—for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate."

"What do you anticipate of me?"

"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now—a very little while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again—like me, I say, not love me.I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my dear master."

"Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only like, but love you—with truth, fervour, constancy."

"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"

"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts—when they open to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break—at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever tender and true."

"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love such an one?"

"I love it now."

"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult standard?"

"I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me—you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane? What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"

"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers—"

"You were, you little elfish—"

"Hush, sir! You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant."

"Ask me something now, Jane—the least thing: I desire to be entreated—"

"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."

"Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."

"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."

"I might as well 'gild refined gold'. I know it: you request is granted then—for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn: try again."

"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much piqued on one point."

He looked disturbed. "What? What?" he said hastily. "Curiosity is a dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request—"

"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."

"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."

"Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?"

"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for God's sake, don't desire a useless burden! Don't long for poison—don't turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"

"Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don't you think I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and entreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay of my power?"

"I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is up."

"Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled thunderloft'. That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"

"If that will be your married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what had you to ask. thing—out with it?"

"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal better than flattery. I had rather be a thing than an angel. This is what I have to ask—why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry Miss Ingram?"

"Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!" And now he unknit his black brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well pleased at seeing a danger averted. "I think I may confess," he continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane—and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by-the-by, it was you who made me the offer."

"Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?"

"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."

"Excellent! Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of my little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"

"Her feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humbling.Were you jealous, Jane?"

"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know that. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won't she feel forsaken and deserted?"

"Impossible!—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a moment."

"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your principles on some points are eccentric."

"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little awry for want of attention."

"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"

"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the world has the same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."

I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very much—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words had power to express.

"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be entreated, and to yield."

I was again ready with my request. "Communicate your intentions to Mrs. Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman."

"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied. "I mean you to accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding. Did she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"

"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."

"Station! station!—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of those who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go."

I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's parlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady, had been reading her morning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended by Mr.Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.

"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you, Miss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice, as he used to do.Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don't laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month you would be his wife."

"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.

"He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?"

"Yes."

She looked at me bewildered. "I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always been called careful. He means to marry you?"

"He tells me so."

She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.

"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say so.How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know. Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost be your father."

"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant. Mr.Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-twenty."

"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.

I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my eyes.

"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard. It is an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters'; and in this case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or I expect."

"Why?—am I a monster?" I said: "Is it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have a sincere affection for me?"

"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I dare say, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with him."

"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough that all was right."

"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance: distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses."

I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.

"Let me go—let me go to Millcote too!" she cried. "Mr. Rochester won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let me go, mademoiselle."

"That I will, Adèle;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to the front, and my master was the pavement, Pilot following him backwards and forwards.

"Adèle may accompany us, may she not, sir?"

"I told her no. I'll have no brats!—I'll have only you."

"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."

"Not it: she will be a restraint."

He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs.Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at my face.

"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone. Do you really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"

"I would far rather she went, sir."

"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he to Adèle.

She obeyed him with what speed she might.

"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said he,

"When I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and company—for life."

Adèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.

"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir: there is plenty of room on this side."

He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. "I'll send her to school yet," he said, but now he was smiling.

Adèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans mademoiselle?"

"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me."

"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adèle.

"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle."

"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"

"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."

"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will wear out: how can she get new ones?"

Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. "Hem!" said he. "What would you do, Adèle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow."

"She is far better as she is," concluded Adèle, after musing some time: "besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."

"She has consented: she has pledged her word."

"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and neither you nor she can fly."

"Adèle, look at that field." We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rainrefreshed.

"In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this effect—

It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her horn, rising over Hayhill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly."

"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify! Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring. 'Put it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.' She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring again."

"But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don't care for the fairy: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"

"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai menteur", and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his "contes de fée", and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fées, et quand même il y en avait;" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.

The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr.Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose half-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk. "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would yet see me glittering like a parterre."

Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee. "It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr.Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now." And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.

"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I'll be married in this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin."

He chuckled; he rubbed his hands. "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?" he exclaimed. "Is she original? Is she piquant? I would not exchange this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!"

The Eastern allusion bit me again. "I'll not stand you an inch in the stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for one. If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here."

"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"

"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them that are enslaved—your harem inmates amongst the rest. I'll get admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."

"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."

"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released, would be to violate its conditions."

"Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they be?"

"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.Do you remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Céline Varens. I shall continue to act as Adèle's governess; by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides. I'll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but—"

"Well, but what?"

"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."

"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal," said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. "Will it please you to dine with me today?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.

"No, thank you, sir."

"And what for 'no, thank you,' if one may inquire."

"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now: till—"

"Till what? You delight in half-phrases."

"Till I can't help it."

"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the companion of my repast?"

"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as usual for another month."

"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."

"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."

"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this, 'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adèle would say; and unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But listen—whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this (touching his watch-guard). Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne."

He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he afterwards lifted out Adèle, I entered the house, and made good my retreat upstairs.

He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a tête-à-tête conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked to sing—good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and, in his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in listening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song. He said I was a capricious witch, and that he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like the present.

"Did I like his voice?" he asked.

"Very much." I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and stimulate it.

"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."

"Very well, sir, I will try."

I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a little bungler". Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was precisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following strain:





"The truest love that ever heart

Felt at its kindled core,

Did through each vein, in quickened start,

The tide of being pour.



Her coming was my hope each day,

Her parting was my pain;

The chance that did her steps delay

Was ice in every vein.



I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,

As I loved, loved to be;

And to this object did I press

As blind as eagerly.



But wide as pathless was the space

That lay our lives between,

And dangerous as the foamy race

Of ocean-surges green.



And haunted as a robber-path

Through wilderness or wood;

For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,

Between our spirits stood.



I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;

I omens did defy:

Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,

I passed impetuous by.



On sped my rainbow, fast as light;

I flew as in a dream;

For glorious rose upon my sight

That child of Shower and Gleam.



Still bright on clouds of suffering dim

Shines that soft, solemn joy;

Nor care I now, how dense and grim

Disasters gather nigh.



I care not in this moment sweet,

Though all I have rushed o'er

Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,

Proclaiming vengeance sore.



Though haughty Hate should strike me down,

Right, bar approach to me,

And grinding Might, with furious frown,

Swear endless enmity.



My love has placed her little hand

With noble faith in mine,

And vowed that wedlock's sacred band

Our nature shall entwine.



My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,

With me to live—to die;

I have at last my nameless bliss.

As I love—loved am I!"





He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament. I quailed momentarily—then I rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be prepared—I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity, "whom he was going to marry now?"

"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."

"Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a pagan idea? I had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on that."

"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!Death was not for such as I."

"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."

"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a reconciling kiss?"

"No: I would rather be excused."

Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing"; and it was added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise."

I assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.

"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"

"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered myself I was doing that now."

He fretted, pished, and pshawed. "Very good," I thought; "you may fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage."

From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then, after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.

The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.

In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet", "malicious elf", "sprite", "changeling", etc. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well.Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised."

Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.





CHAPTER XXV


The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. I, at least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; tomorrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I (D.V.)—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr.Rochester had himself written the direction, "Mrs. Rochester, —Hotel, London," on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester! She did not exist: she would not be born till tomorrow, some time after eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o'clock—gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. "I will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said. "I am feverish: I hear the wind blowing; I will go out of doors and feel it."

It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to commence tomorrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind more than they.

I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but myself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles off—business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited now his return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence.

I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads northward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.

It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.

"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. "I think, scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathize with him in his decay." As I looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.

Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the house and put them away in the store-room. Then I repaired to the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten.

"How late it grows!" I said. "I will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."

The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried by one moving speck.

A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.

"I wish he would come! I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realized; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.

"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."

I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him.

"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the saddle: "you can't do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe; give me both hands: mount!"

I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well as I could. He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?"

"No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind."

"Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?"

"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."

"Then you have been both?"

"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-by, sir; and I dare say you will only laugh at me for my pains."

"I'll laugh at you heartily when tomorrow is past; till then I dare not: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?"

"I wanted you: but don't boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me get down."

He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I found him at supper.

"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."

I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat. "Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?"

"I cannot see my prospects clearly tonight, sir; and I hardly know what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal."

"Except me: I am substantial enough—touch me."

"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."

He held out his hand, laughing. "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well as a long, strong arm.

"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from before my face. "Sir, have you finished supper?"

"Yes, Jane."

I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.

"It is near midnight," I said.

"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding."

"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish to go to bed."

"Are all your arrangements complete?"

"All, sir."

"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and we shall leave Thornfield tomorrow, within half-an-hour after our return from church."

"Very well, sir."

"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—'very well,' Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?"

"I believe I am."

"Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel."

"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come charged?"

"This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or overfatigued."

"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"

"Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart's core."

I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.

"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?—that I shall not prove a good husband?"

"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."

"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the new life into which you are passing?"

"No."

"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain me. I want an explanation."

"Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?"

"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened in my absence: nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"

"No, sir." It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibritting stroke, and then I proceeded.

"All day, yesterday, I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don't caress me now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before me—your life, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present—the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet."

"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"

"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark, the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and high—but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie. I wished you were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I could not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop—but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment."

"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to you? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget that; and you cannot deny it. Those words did not die inarticulate on your lips. I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music—'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because I love you.' Do you love me, Jane?—repeat it."

"I do, sir—I do, with my whole heart."

"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that sentence has penetrated by breast painfully. Why? I think because you said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me you hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened."

"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have finished my tale: but hear me to the end."

"I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream."

I shook my head. "What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on."

The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.

"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke."

"Now, Jane, that is all."

"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam dazzled my eyes; I thought—Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?' No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau. 'Sophie! Sophie!' I again cried: and still it was silent.I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not—no, I was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."

"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.

"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."

"Describe it, Jane."

"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."

"Did you see her face?"

"Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."

"And how were they?"

"Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"

"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."

"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?"

"You may."

"Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre."

"Ah!—what did it do?"

"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."

"Afterwards?"

"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—she thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in my life—only the second time—I became insensible from terror."

"Who was with you when you revived?"

"No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"

"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough handling."

"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the transaction actually took place."

"And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall a ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you without a tear—without a kiss—without a word?"

"Not yet."

"Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."

"Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the mystery of that awful visitant."

"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."

"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet—I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis—the veil, torn from top to bottom in two halves!"

I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round me. "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "That if anything malignant did come near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think what might have happened!"

He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could scarcely pant. After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily—

"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman was—must have been—Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her—what did she do to me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the mystery?"

I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so—relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented smile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.

"Does not Sophie sleep with Adèle in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my candle.

"Yes, sir."

"And there is room enough in Adèle's little bed for you. You must share it with her tonight, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery."

"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."

"And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time tomorrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet. Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the windowpanes: look here (he lifted up the curtain)—it is a lovely night!"

It was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.

"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my Janet now?"

"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."

"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow tonight; but of happy love and blissful union."

This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all. With little Adèle in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so tranquil, so passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day: all my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too. I remember Adèle clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my past life; and he, I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future day.





CHAPTER XXVI


Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose, impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She was just fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.

"Stop!" she cried in French. "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have not taken one peep."

So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. "Jane!" called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the stairs by Mr.Rochester.

"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry so long!"

He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately hired servants, a footman, answered it.

"Is John getting the carriage ready?"

"Yes, sir."

"Is the luggage brought down?"

"They are bringing it down, sir."

"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there: return and tell me."

The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the footman soon returned.

"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."

"And the carriage?"

"The horses are harnessing."

"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in his seat."

"Yes, sir."

"Jane, are you ready?"

I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did so bent up to a purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.

I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. I wanted to see the invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he seemed breasting and resisting.

At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of breath. "Am I cruel in my love?" he said. "Delay an instant: lean on me, Jane."

And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green gravemounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.I noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I dare say, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold.When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the porch.

We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was still: two shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct: the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.

Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a gentleman, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began.The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.Rochester, went on.

"I require and charge you both—as you will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed—, that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."

He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched towards Mr.Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?"—when a distinct and near voice said—

"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."

The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he said, "Proceed."

Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said—

"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood."

"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us. "I am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this marriage exists."

Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and strong grasp he had! And how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild beneath!

Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. "What is the nature of the impediment?" he asked. "Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?"

"Hardly," was the answer. "I have called it insuperable, and I speak advisedly."

The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued, uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—

"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr.Rochester has a wife now living."

My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.

"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.

"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of —Street, London."

"And you would thrust on me a wife?"

"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law recognises, if you do not."

"Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her place of abode."

"Certainly." Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read out in a sort of official, nasal voice—

"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D.—(a date of fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the county of —, and of Ferndean Manor, in —shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at —church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church—a copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard Mason.'"

"That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."

"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.

"How do you know?"

"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely controvert."

"Produce him—or go to hell."

"I will produce him first—he is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the goodness to step forward."

Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder—yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him. His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred, lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!" Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only asked—"What have you to say?"

An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.

"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand, what have you to say?"

"Sir—sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred place." Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "are you aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"

"Courage," urged the lawyer—"speak out."

"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate tones: "I saw her there last April. I am her brother."

"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman. "Impossible! I am an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall."

I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered—

"No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under that name." He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he formed his resolve, and announced it—

"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding today." The man obeyed.

Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-man uvred me, or Providence has checked me—perhaps the last. I am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up!— what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I dare say you have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago, Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer up, Dick!—never fear me!—I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations? Her mother, the Creole, was both a mad woman and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes!Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and my wife! You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner! Come all of you—follow!"

Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came after.At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.

"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it will not be wanted today."

At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet us.

"To the right-about—every soul!" cried the master; "Away with your congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too late!"

He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.

"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you here."

He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain.Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan.In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.

"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester. "How are you? and how is your charge today?"

"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not rageous."

A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind feet.

"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "You'd better not stay."

"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."

"Take care then, sir!—for God's sake, take care!"

The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognized well that purple face—those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.

"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."

"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom her craft."

"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.

"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.

"Ware!" cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.Mr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.

"That is my wife," said he. "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure hours! And this is what I wished to have (laying his hand on my shoulder): this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment you judge or you shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize."

We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he descended the stair.

"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be glad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason returns to Madeira."

"My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?"

"Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his house for some years. When your uncle received your letter intimating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He referred him to me for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.

"No, no—let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.

I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved—followed up and down where I was led or dragged—watched event rush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.

The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.

I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change: nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her prospects?

Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate.A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, today were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead—struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master's—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms—it could not derive warmth from his breast.Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted—confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!

My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only still throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them—

"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."

It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me."





CHAPTER XXVII


Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked, "What am I to do?"

But the answer my mind gave—"Leave Thornfield at once"—was so prompt, so dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such words now. "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable. I cannot do it."

But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.

"Let me be torn away!" I cried. "Let another help me!"

"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."

I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge haunted—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me. "Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an out-stretched arm caught me. I looked up—I was supported by Mr.Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.

"You come out at last," he said. "Well, I have been waiting for you long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar.So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. You are passionate. I expected a scene of some kind. I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?

"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter—nothing poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.

"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you ever forgive me?"

Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my heart's core.

"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired wistfully—wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness than of will.

"Yes, sir."

"Then tell me so roundly and sharply—don't spare me."

"I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water." He heaved a sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs. At first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber. He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the library—sitting in his chair—he was quite near. "If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's. I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave him—I cannot leave him."

"How are you now, Jane?"

"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."

"Taste the wine again, Jane."

I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and looked at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I turned my face away and put his aside.

"What!—How is this?" he exclaimed hastily. "Oh, I know! you won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and my embraces appropriated?"

"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."

"Why, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for you—because I have a wife already, you would reply—I guess rightly?"

"Yes."

"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard me as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect. What do you say to that? I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how to act—talking you consider is of no use. I know you—I am on my guard."

"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice warned me to curtail my sentence.

"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine, you are scheming to destroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man—as a married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss me. You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only as Adèle's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will say—'that man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."

I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir; I must change too—there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one way—Adèle must have a new governess, sir."

"Oh, Adèle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine.Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adèle never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac elsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect assassination, even of what I most hate.

"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I'll shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with my wife, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when my wife is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on—"

"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady: you speak of her with hate—with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel—she cannot help being mad."

"Jane, my little darling—so I will call you, for so you are—, you don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"

"I do indeed, sir."

"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive. I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me. But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: tomorrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander."

"And take Adèle with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion for you."

"What do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Adèle to school; and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child—a French dancer's bastard? Why do you importune me about her! I say, why do you assign Adèle to me for a companion?"

"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull for you."

"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation. "I see I must come to an explanation. I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming in your countenance. You are to share my solitude. Do you understand?"

I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot. He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.

"Now for the hitch in Jane's character." he said at last, speaking more calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak. "The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle: here it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a fraction of Samson's strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"

He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just before me.

"Jane! will you hear reason? (he stooped and approached his lips to my ear) Because, if you won't, I'll try violence." His voice was hoarse; his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him. The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which to control and restrain him—a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom—and his. But I was not afraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him, soothingly—

"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."

He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly. I had been struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave way and cried heartily.

Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could not while he was in such a passion.

"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it.Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."

His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn, became calm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but I would not permit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.

"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then? It was only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape."

These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm where I had wounded.

"I do love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."

"The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"

"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."

"Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping."

"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."

"For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face—which looks feverish?"

"I must leave Adèle and Thornfield. I must part with you for my whole life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes."

"Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about parting from me. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the new existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married. You shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally. I shall keep only to you so long as you and I live. You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must be reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."

His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed: still I dared to speak.

"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by yourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false."

"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that: I am not long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware!"

He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands. To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to one higher than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.

"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. "I keep telling her I am not married, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union with her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in opinion, when she knows all that I know! Just put your hand in mine, Janet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me—and I will in a few words show you the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?"

"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."

"I ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know at I was not the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"

"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."

"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"

"I have understood something to that effect."

"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.My father said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very little private conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission. Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!—an agony of inward contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her. I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her mind or manners—and, I married her: gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might have—But let me remember to whom I am speaking.

"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. The honey-moon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum. There was a younger brother, too—a complete dumb idiot.The elder one, whom you have seen—and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me, will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my brother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against me.

"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile—when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting orders—even then I restrained myself: I eschewed up-braiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.

"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words shall express what I have to say. I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty. What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.

"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my father died too. I was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me. And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that my wife was mad—her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?"

"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you."

"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them. But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this moment—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with which your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine. Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent—my arms wait to receive her."

"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"

"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all that intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own sight—and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects. Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband—that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior—her family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her age—, she was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

"One night I had been awakened by her yells—since the medical men had pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up—it was a fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window. The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no refreshment anywhere. Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air—those are the sounds of the bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul. Of the fanatic's burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present one—let me break away, and go home to God!'

"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself. I only entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.

"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and pineapples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to follow.

"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a pure draught. I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible. From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus—

"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like. That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband. See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity, her connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave her.'

"I acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother had not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring to publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.

"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a monster in the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield, and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den—a goblin's cell.I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. She and the surgeon, Carter—who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and worried, are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled. The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you. I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles—"

"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had settled her here? Where did you go?"

"What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the Marchs-pirit. I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its lands. My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield—"

"But you could not marry, sir."

"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was burdened."

"Well, sir?"

"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You open your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the tablet of one's heart. But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your 'Well, sir?' It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I don't very well know why."

"I mean—what next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?"

"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"

"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you; and what she said."

"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence. Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German gr finnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realization of my dream: but I was presently undeserved. You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I longed only for what suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly. Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I—warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions—would have asked to marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure. Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them. You already know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated. She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"

"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and then another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course."

"It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of existence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading. I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Céline, Giacinta, and Clara."

I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching that had ever been instilled into me, as—under any pretext—with any justification—through any temptation—to become the successor of these poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in his mind desecrated their memory. I did not give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it. I impressed it on my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.

"Now, Jane, why don't you say, 'Well, sir?' I have not done. You are looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to the point. Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to England.

"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.Abhorred spot! I expected no peace, no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap and sense—stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf must return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—or I could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret. I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you. The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for half an hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Adèle claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to say, 'My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.' You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.

"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence. An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed—much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillized your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.

"I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might be—whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart."

"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.

"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the past, when the present is so much surer—the future so much brighter?"

I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.

"You see now how the case stands—do you not?" he continued. "After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have found you. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel. I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.

"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly my life of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier existence—shown to you, not my resolution (that word is weak), but my resistless bent to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours. Jane—give it me now."

A pause.

"Why are you silent, Jane?"

I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and idol.One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—"Depart!"

"Jane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise—'I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.'"

"Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours."

Another long silence.

"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still voice was the pant of a lion rising—"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go another?"

"I do."

"Jane (bending towards and embracing me), do you mean it now?"

"I do."

"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.

"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.

"Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This—this is wicked. It would not be wicked to love me."

"It would to obey you."

A wild look raised his brows—crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, I feared—but I resolved.

"One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone. All happiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder churchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for a companion and for some hope?"

"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again there."

"Then you will not yield?"

"No."

"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?" His voice rose.

"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."

"Then you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust for a passion—vice for an occupation?"

"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for myself. We were born to strive and endure—you as well as I: do so. You will forget me before I forget you."

"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct! Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach?—for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?"

This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.They spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. "Oh, comply!" it said. "Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in the world cares for you? or who will be injured by what you do?"

Still indomitable was the reply: "I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now.Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."

I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist.He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed strength almost exhausted.

"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand! (And he shook me with the force of his hold) I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage, beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit—with will and energy, and virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!"

As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me. The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however, would have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his fury; I must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.

"You are going, Jane?"

"I am going, sir."

"You are leaving me?"

"Yes."

"You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"

What unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate firmly, "I am going."

"Jane!"

"Mr. Rochester!"

"Withdraw, then—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings—think of me."

He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. "Oh, Jane!my hope—my love—my life!" broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a deep, strong sob.

I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back as determinedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his face from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my hand.

"God bless you, my dear master!" I said. "God keep you from harm and wrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kindness to me."

"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered; "without it, my heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love: yes—nobly, generously."

Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.

"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added, "Farewell for ever!"





That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay down in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears. The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come—watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart—

"My daughter, flee temptation."

"Mother, I will."

So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. "It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride's who had melted in air. The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.

"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door. "Farewell, my darling Adèle!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery. No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.

I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened. There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say—

"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of this.

That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.He would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of this too.My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided on.

Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.

A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly sad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.

I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now—in his room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how it goaded me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in. Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I had no solace from selfapprobation: none even from self-respect. I had injured—wounded—left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some fear—or hope—that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet—as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.

When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections.I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.

Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.





CHAPTER XXVIII


Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.

Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet: white-washed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.

I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.

Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man. Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.

What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!

I touched the heath, it was dry, and yet warm with the beat of the summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness. Tonight, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny—my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit's meal. I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.

Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least—at the commencement of the night, cold.

My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.

Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.

But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got up, and I looked round me.

What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading moor!Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was a human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.

Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.

I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human life and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.

About two o'clock p.m., I entered the village. At the bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.

I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it. Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?"

"Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for."

I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face with necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must apply somewhere.Where?

"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?"

"Nay; she couldn't say."

"What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people do?"

"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's needle-factory, and at the foundry."

"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"

"Nay; it was men's work."

"And what do the women do?"

"I knawn't," was the answer. "Some does one thing, and some another.Poor folk mun get on as they can."

She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I took leave.

I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and faltering—I asked if a servant was wanted here?

"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."

"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued. "I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want some work: no matter what."

But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale. She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out. If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.

I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.

I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards it.Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman's function to help—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves. I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage?

"Yes."

"Was the clergyman in?"

"No."

"Would he be in soon?"

"No, he was gone from home."

"To a distance?"

"Not so far—happen three miles. He had been called away by the sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer."

"Was there any lady of the house?"

"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.

Once more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request—"Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?"

She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'that way."

Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. "How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.

"Would she take my gloves?"

"No! what could she do with them?"

Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so.To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am sick of the subject.

A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I stopped and said—

"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry." He cast on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from his loaf and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.

I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough.

"Will you give me that?" I asked.

She stared at me. "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to give her these porridge."

"Well, lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar. T'pig doesn't want it."

The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it ravenously.

As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.

"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy. "I feel I cannot go much further. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer!Aid!—direct me!"

My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.

"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road," I reflected. "And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens there be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave."

To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.

My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. "That is an ignisfatuus ," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. "Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned. I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge. "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have it shut in my face."

And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly numbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere long.

The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.

Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On each side stood a sable bush-holly or yew.

Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere.All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire.I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.

I noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young, graceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.

A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call them handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the clickclick of the woman's knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.

"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terror—listen!" And in a low voice she read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell.

"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it." The other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me—conveying no meaning—

"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.' Good! good!" she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. "There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a hundred pages of fustian. 'Ich w-ge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.' I like it!"

Both were again silent.

"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman, looking up from her knitting.

"Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way."

"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t'one t'other: and if either o'ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"

"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don't speak German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."

"And what good does it do you?"

"We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than we do now."

"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for tonight."

"I think we have: at least I'm tired. Mary, are you?"

"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon."

"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home."

"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"

The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.

"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."

She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.

"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."

"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.

"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr.St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day—that is, a fortnight sin'—and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand him. Ah, childer!that's t' last o' t' old stock—for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned. She wor the pictur' o'ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."

I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence.One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck ten.

"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.St. John when he comes in."

And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera.Hannah opened.

"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.

"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.

"You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come from?"

"I am a stranger."

"What is your business here at this hour?"

"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat."

Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face. "I'll give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely."

"Do let me speak to your mistresses."

"No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill."

"But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?"

"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don't do wrong, that's all. Here is a penny; now go—"

"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don't shut the door!— oh, don't, for God's sake!"

"I must; the rain is driving in—"

"Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—"

"Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't make such a noise. Move off."

"But I must die if I am turned away."

"Not you. I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk's houses at this time o' night. If you've any followers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns." Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within.

This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true despair—rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung my hands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to regain.

"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God. Let me try to wait His will in silence."

These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there—dumb and still.

"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you perished here of want."

"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.

"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.

"Yes—yes; open quickly."

"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about. There has been a beggarwoman—I declare she is not gone yet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!"

"Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house."

With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean, bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me.

"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.

"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.

"She does look white," said Hannah.

"As white as clay or death," was responded. "She will fall: let her sit."

And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.

"Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!"

"A mere spectre!"

"Is she ill, or only famished?"

"Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of bread."

Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it, and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."

"Yes—try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon.

"Not too much at first—restrain her," said the brother; "she has had enough." And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.

"A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes."

"No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her name."

I felt I could speak, and I answered—"My name is Jane Elliott." Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an alias.

"And where do you live? Where are your friends?"

I was silent.

"Can we send for any one you know?"

I shook my head.

"What account can you give of yourself?"

Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off the mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at present I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—

"Sir, I can give you no details tonight."

"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"

"Nothing," I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana took the word—

"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?" I looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her compassionate gate with a smile, I said: "I will trust you. If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth tonight: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I feel a spasm when I speak." All three surveyed me, and all three were silent.

"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over."

They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I thanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy—and slept.





CHAPTER XXIX


The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bed-side—

"It is very well we took her in."

"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone through?"

"Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"

"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."

"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be agreeable."

Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to, myself. I was comforted.

Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue.He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."

"Far otherwise," responded Diana. "To speak truth, St. John, my heart rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit her permanently."

"That is hardly likely," was the reply, "you will find she is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability." He stood considering me some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."

"She is so ill, St. John."

"Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features."

On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the food was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed.When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the humiliation.

On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.

It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilized by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.

"What, you have got up!" she said. "You are better, then. You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."

She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—

"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"

I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—

"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than yourself or your young ladies."

After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house, nor no brass, I guess?"

"The want of house or brass—by which I suppose you mean money—does not make a beggar in your sense of the word."

"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.

"Yes, very."

"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"

"I was at a boarding-school eight years."

She opened her eyes wide. "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"

"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are you going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a basket of the fruit.

"Mak' em into pies."

"Give them to me and I'll pick them."

"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."

"But I must do something. Let me have them."

She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."

"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she remarked. "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"

"No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are."

"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."

"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"

"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton."

"That village a few miles off?"

"Aye."

"And what is he?"

"He is a parson."

I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had asked to see the clergyman.

"This, then, was his father's residence?"

"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and gurt (great) grandfather afore him."

"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"

"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."

"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"

"Yes."

"Their father is dead?"

"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."

"They have no mother?"

"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."

"Have you lived with the family long?"

"I've lived here thirty years. I nursed them all three."

"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar."

She again regarded me with a surprised stare. "I believe," she said, "I was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me."

"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."

"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o'th' childer nor of mysel: poor things! They've like nobody to tak' care on 'em but me. I'm like to look sharpish."

I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.

"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.

"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why—not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no 'brass' and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime."

"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang—but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a raight down dacent little crater."

"That will do—I forgive you now. Shake hands." She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.

Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer", as she called the young people.

Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two hundred years old—for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale. But she could remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers wor gentry I' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers I' Morton Church vestry." Still, she allowed, "The owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o' t' common way: stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like." The mistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "Bairns" had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always been "Of a mak' of their own." Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor "threaped". She did not know where there was such a family for being united.

Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two ladies and their brother were now.

"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half an hour to tea."

They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.

"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said. "You still look very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!"

Diana had a voice toned to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face seemed to me full of charm. Mary's countenance was equally intelligent—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently. It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active will.

"And what business have you here?" she continued. "It is not your place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be free, even to license—but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour."

"I am very well here."

"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."

"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.

"To be sure," added her sister. "Come, you must be obedient." And still holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.

"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our little moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."

She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first, the parlour, and then its occupant.

The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the room—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of work-boxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn and well saved.

Mr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young—perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his. He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.

This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat, there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.

"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry. Hannah says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast."

I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided stead-fastness in his gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.

"You are very hungry," he said.

"I am, sir." It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.

"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately."

"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.

"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."

"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely without home and friends."

The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.

"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from every connection?"

"I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to admittance under any roof in England."

"A most singular position at your age!"

Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon explained the quest.

"You have never been married? You are a spinster?"

Diana laughed.

"Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St. John," said she.

"I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No."

I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.

"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.

"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look.

"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my secret," I replied concisely.

"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.

"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he said. "And you need help, do you not?"

"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."

"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you can do."

I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.

"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a great service—the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.

"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I could know them. I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable institution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan Asylum, —shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer."

"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."

"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible.No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points in planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."

"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused; "she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss Elliott."

I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias: I had forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at once.

"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.

"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to me."

"Your real name you will not give?"

"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to it, I avoid."

"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana. "Now do, brother, let her be at peace a while."

But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.

"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion, and, above all, with my charity (I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it—it is just): you desire to be independent of us?"

"I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution."

"Indeed you shall stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my head. "You shall," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her.

"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John, "as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement. I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer."

"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."

"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-work-woman; I will be a servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.

"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. "If such is your spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way."

He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.





CHAPTER XXX


The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them. In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.

I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fernbanks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs: they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.

Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.

If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana. Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection—of the strongest kind—was the result. They discovered I could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service. My skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.

As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.

No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful—

"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to myself?"

Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.

But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.

I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.

Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.

It began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom. When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannized over me ruthlessly.

Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning, being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess— which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his—when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.

Looking up as I drew near—"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.

"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself to undertake?"

"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."

"And they will go in three days now?" I said.

"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."

I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.

"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."

"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept."

He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.

"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependent's crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the head of that church militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, 'Rise, follow Me!'"

St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance.He resumed—

"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading—for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."

"Well?" I said, as he again paused, "Proceed."

He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations.

"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."

"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.

"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is—how trivial, how cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house. Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will you be this mistress?"

He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was humble—but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading. I made my decision.

"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart."

"But you comprehend me?" he said. "It is a village school: your scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers' children—at the best, farmers' daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your mind—sentiments—tastes?"

"Save them till they are wanted. They will keep."

"You know what you undertake, then?"

"I do."

He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.

"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"

"I will go to my house tomorrow, and open the school, if you like, next week."

"Very well: so be it."

He rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at me. He shook his head.

"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.

"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"

"Why? What is your reason for saying so?"

"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life."

"I am not ambitious."

He started at the word "ambitious". He repeated, "No. What made you think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find it out?"

"I was speaking of myself."

"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—" He paused.

"What?"

"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the word, and been displeased. I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made useless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service—I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness. Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means."

He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.

Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.

"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!" And the tears gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.

"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother," she murmured.

At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a letter. He entered.

"Our uncle John is dead," said he.

Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.

"Dead?" repeated Diana.

"Yes."

She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. "And what then?" she demanded, in a low voice.

"What then, Di?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature. "What then? Why—nothing. Read."

He threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All three looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive smile enough.

"Amen! We can yet live," said Diana at last.

"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked Mary.

"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might have been," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what is."

He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.

For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.

"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was my mother's brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by his advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realized a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."

This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day I left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B—. In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.





CHAPTER XXXI


My home, then—when I at last find a home—is a cottage; a little room with white-washed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.

It is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth. This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But three of the number can read: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a few sew a little.They speak with the broadest accent of the district. At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's language. Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a disposition that pleases me. I must not forget that these coarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those of the best-born. My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office. Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.

Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to deceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree. I felt—yes, idiot that I am—I felt degraded. I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence. I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I heard and saw round me. But let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong—that is a great step gained; I shall strive to overcome them.Tomorrow, I trust, I shall get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite subdued. In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for disgust.

Meantime, let me ask myself one question: Which is better?—To have surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort—no struggle—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr. Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he would—oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while. He did love me—no one will ever love me so again. I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms.He was fond and proud of me—it is what no man besides will ever be.But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and above all, feeling? Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss one hour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next—or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?

Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!

Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest−day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. The birds were singing their last strains—





"The air was mild, the dew was balm."





While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping—and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now, perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say londely, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in.

"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."

I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it.

"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he asked.

"Oh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very well."

"But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture—have disappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough; but—" I interrupted—

"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious. All I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine."

"But you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind you is dark and empty."

"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness."

"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot's wife. What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least."

"It is what I mean to do," I answered. St. John continued—

"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our will strains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.

"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death. I burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more exciting toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice. I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds; my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.

"A missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal. My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I will overcome—and I leave Europe for the East."

He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too. Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket. We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed—

"Good evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is quicker to recognize his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me now."

It was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the west. He turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side. There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which, combined, realize the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.

What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.

"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.

"Oh, I only came home from S— (she mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant) this afternoon. Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?" pointing to me.

"It is," said St. John.

"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.

"I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so."

"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"

"Quite."

"Do you like your house?"

"Very much."

"Have I furnished it nicely?"

"Very nicely, indeed."

"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"

"You have indeed. She is teachable and handy." (This then, I thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)

"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added. "It will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. Mr. Rivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S—. Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock. The —th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame."

It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper lip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.

As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. "Poor Carlo loves me," said she. "He is not stern and distant to his friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."

As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face. I saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.

"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking up. "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"

"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.John.

"Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?" She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.

"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at herself. "I am so giddy and thoughtless! Do excuse me. It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa."

"Not tonight, Miss Rosamond, not tonight."

Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort it cost him thus to refuse.

"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any longer: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!"

She held out her hand. He just touched it. "Good evening!" he repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a moment returned.

"Are you well?" she asked. Well might she put the question: his face was blanched as her gown.

"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate. She went one way; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned at all.

This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own. Diana Rivers had designated her brother "inexorable as death". She had not exaggerated.





CHAPTER XXXII


I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won both my good will and my admiration.These soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners.The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I had amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown, almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them—characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.

I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet": serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met Mr.Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the burst of passion. By nine o'clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.

Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the school was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She would canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children. She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor's heart. A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.

Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say, with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."

And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not bind all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.

Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.

She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel." I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a lusus naturae, she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.

One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors. She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.

"Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a love—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first school in S—. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"

"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist—delight at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another day.

She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of Rosamond's portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale Hall.

I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton School, and said he only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and would soon quit it for one more suitable.

"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa."

I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with great respect. He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best. He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond's union with St. John. Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.

It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright—scoured floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.

The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature. The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.

"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said. "Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely.You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace," and he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days—the golden age of modern literature.Alas! the readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell of your own meanness.

While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of Marmion (for Marmion it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read his heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do him some good, if I could.

"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make him talk."

I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers." But he answered, as he always did, that he could not stay. "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me. I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."

"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.

"Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely."

"You did, Mr. Rivers."

He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me astonished. "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within. "I don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to considerable lengths." I continued, "You observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I rose and placed it in his hand.

"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very graceful and correct drawing."

"Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?"

Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."

"Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless."

He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. "It is like!" he murmured; "the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!"

"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting? Tell me that! When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"

He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.

"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or wise is another question."

Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my views than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered—

"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once."

By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to "burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.

"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her. You ought to marry her."

"Does she like me?" he asked.

"Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so often."

"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said, "very: go on for another quarter of an hour." And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon the table to measure the time.

"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart?"

"Don't imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with her sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has copied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips. She is mine—I am hers—this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say nothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the time I marked pass in peace."

I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood silent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.

"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers. I tasted her cup. The pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all this."

I gazed at him in wonder.

"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know."

"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.

"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such that she could sympathize in nothing I aspired to—cooperate in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? Rosamond a missionary's wife? No!"

"But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme."

"Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting peace for war, freedom for bondage, religion for superstition, the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to live for."

After a considerable pause, I said, "And Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"

"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I should do."

"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are wasting away."

"No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning, I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."

"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom."

Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in this sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.

"You are original," said he, "and not timid. There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I shade before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man."

I smiled incredulously.

"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state—stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence.I watch your career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer."

"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.

"No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I advocate them: I am sworn to spread them. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my original qualities thus: From the minute germ, natural affection, she has developed the over-shadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom, to achieve victories for the standard of the cross. So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"

Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.

"She is lovely," he murmured. "She is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!"

"And may I not paint one like it for you?"

"Cui bono? No."

He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took it up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.

"What is the matter?" I asked.

"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good afternoon", he vanished.

"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district; "that caps the globe, however!"

I, in my turn, scrutinized the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.





CHAPTER XXXIII


When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down Marmion and beginning—





"Day set on Norham's castled steep,

And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,

And Cheviot's mountains lone;

The massive towers, the donjon keep,

The flanking walls that round them sweep,

In yellow lustre shone—"





I soon forgot storm in music.

I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St.John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night.

"Any ill news?" I demanded. "Has anything happened?"

"No. How very easily alarmed you are?" he answered, removing his cloak and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow from his boots.

"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse me for once." Then he approached the fire. "I have had hard work to get here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame. "One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."

"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.

"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been halft-old, and who is impatient to hear the sequel."

He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the fire-light shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say—

"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health."

"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary. I am well now.What do you see amiss in me?"

This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I was silenced.

He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind him.

"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.

"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still: I'll let you alone now, and return to my book."

So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of Marmion. He soon stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if my he liked, but talk I would.

"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"

"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."

"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements? You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"

"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me." Baffled so far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars. "Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close—they would have come today but for the snow."

"Indeed?"

"Mr. Oliver pays for two."

"Does he?"

"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."

"I know."

"Was it your suggestion?"

"No."

"Whose, then?"

"His daughter's, I think."

"It is like her: she is so good-natured."

"Yes."

Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.

"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.

Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.

"Half an hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.

"Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment—fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in —shire.) They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as that of the snowdrift I almost stuck fast in tonight. Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-law, called—I come to names now—Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You start—did you hear a noise? I dare say it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats. —To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It seems her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours. She left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester."

"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.

"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. She had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is it not an odd tale?"

"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he doing? Is he well?"

"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess— the nature of the event which requires her appearance."

"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr.Rochester?"

"I suppose not."

"But they wrote to him?"

"Of course."

"And what did he say? Who has his letters?"

"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax'."

I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe sufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there? I dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master—once almost my husband—whom I had often called "my dear Edward"!

"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.

"You don't know him—don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with warmth.

"Very well," he answered quietly; "and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white."

And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover.He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"—the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.

"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre;" he said, "the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott. I confess I had my suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty.You own the name and renounce the alias?"

"Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr.Rochester than you do."

"Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you."

"Well, what did he want?"

"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely that— nothing more."

"I!—rich?"

"Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress."

Silence succeeded.

"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents."

Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and blood over our bliss with a solemn brow.

Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came only to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self. It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I felt that—that thought swelled my heart.

"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers. "I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?"

"How much am I worth?"

"Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I think they say—but what is that?"

"Twenty thousand pounds?"

Here was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand. This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard laugh before, laughed now.

"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."

"It is a large sum—don't you think there is a mistake?"

"No mistake at all."

"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!"

"It is written in letters, not figures—twenty thousand."

I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.

"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows. Good-night."

He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.

"Stop one minute!" I cried.

"Well?"

"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the power to aid in my discovery."

"Oh! I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters." Again the latch rattled.

"No: that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.

"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more about it."

"Another time."

"No; tonight! tonight!" and as he turned from the door, I placed myself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.

"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said. "I would rather not just now."

"You shall!—you must!"

"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."

Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.

"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to persuade."

"And I am a hard woman—impossible to put off."

"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."

"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr.Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."

"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must know some day—as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?"

"Of course: that was all settled before."

"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"

"No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely—"

I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself—that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight—every ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his explanation.

"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out. You know the rest." Again he was going, but I set my back against the door.

"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect." I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough. I resumed—

"Your mother was my father's sister?"

"Yes."

"My aunt, consequently?"

He bowed.

"My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"

"Undeniably."

"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the same source?"

"We are cousins; yes."

I surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud of—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!—wealth to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating—not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight. I now clapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.

"Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!" I exclaimed.

St. John smiled. "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles?" he asked. "You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."

"What can you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations—or two, if you don't choose to be counted—are born into my world full-grown. I say again, I am glad!"

I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them: thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars—every one lit me to a purpose or delight. Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit. They were under a yoke—I could free them: they were scattered—I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be theirs, too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each—enough and to spare: justice would be done—mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin—it was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.

How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He also advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.

"Write to Diana and Mary tomorrow," I said, "and tell them to come home directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."

"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must really make an effort to tranquillize your feelings."

"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you? Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an ordinary mortal?"

"You wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too abrupt in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."

"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."

"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should comprehend better."

"Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each? What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them."

"To you, you mean."

"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful.Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections. I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."

"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."

"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the case?"

"I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom. Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own."

"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends."

"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot—"

"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?"

"Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters— without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."

"Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes; slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternization! Close union! Intimate attachment!"

"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realized otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."

"Nonsense, again! Marry! I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."

"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour."

"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation. And I do not want a stranger—unsympathizing, alien, different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."

"I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded—respect for their worth and admiration of their talents. You, too, have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."

"Thank you: that contents me for tonight. Now you had better go; for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple."

"And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?"

"No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."

He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.

I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property; as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point. The instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.





CHAPTER XXXIV


It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached. I now closed Morton School, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.

Mr. Rivers came up, as—having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before me, and locked the door—I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and B-uerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.

"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?" asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. "Does not the consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"

"Doubtless."

"And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the task of regenerating your race be well spent?"

"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday."

He looked grave. "What now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince? What are you going to do?"

"To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."

"Do you want her?"

"Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."

"I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It is better so: Hannah shall go with you."

"Tell her to be ready by tomorrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."

He took it. "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing.What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?"

"My first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend the full force of the expression?) to clean down Moor House from chamber to cellar; my next to rub it up with beeswax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beauideal of a welcome when they come."

St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.

"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys."

"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.

"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."

"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."

"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but then, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence. I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."

I looked at him with surprise. "St. John," I said, "I think you are almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?"

"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account.Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane?"

"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause to be happy, and I will be happy. Good-bye!"

Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. I had previously taken a journey to S— to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me carte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.

The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.

St. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?" I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.

This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.

"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?—By-the-by, could I tell him where such a book was?"

I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.

Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian and Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.

"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to advantage.It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary's career—I see it now."

"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran. It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls. They laughed—kissed me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into the house.

They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.

I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me. They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.

Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathize. The event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In the very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away."

"Where does she live, Hannah?"

"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way."

"Tell him I will go."

"I'm sure, sir, you had better not. It's the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog. And then it is such a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."

But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o'clock: he did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.

I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.

One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes, asked him, "if his plans were yet unchanged."

"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply. And he proceeded to inform us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.

"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his hand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and looked up.

"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S—, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father yesterday."

His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him: he was serene as glass.

"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have known each other long."

"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S—. But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can he refitted for their reception."

The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.

Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said—

"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."

Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment's hesitation I answered—

"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?"

"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!" So saying, he returned to his papers and his silence.

As our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his plans.

Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table.I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton School; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.

"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic; better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."

And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse was a special annoyance.

One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment superstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.

"Jane, what are you doing?"

"Learning German."

"I want you to give up German and learn Hindustani."

"You are not in earnest?"

"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."

He then went on to explain that Hindustani was the language he was himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.

St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to such a step.He answered quietly—

"I know it."

I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell. When he said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.

One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicksome humour (she was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—

"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat her as such: you should kiss her too."

She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.

As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his own.

Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of suspense.

Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.

In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.

I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.

A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the seaside. This St. John opposed; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindustani, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him—I could not resist him.

One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business. The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.

St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—

"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed." And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient, leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it.St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and said—

"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."

"I will call Diana and Mary."

"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.Put on your things; go out by the kitchen door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."

I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him.

The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament.As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.

"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning—where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.

I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.

"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber overcomes me, on the shore of a darker stream!"

Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot's passion for his fatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced—

"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the twentieth of June."

"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.

"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the all-perfect. It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner—to join in the same enterprise."

"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong."

"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."

"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."

"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge and exhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and why they were given—to speak Heaven's message in their ear—to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."

"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?"

I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.

"And what does your heart say?" demanded St. John.

"My heart is mute—my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.

"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice. "Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."

The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard a summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!" But I was no apostle—I could not behold the herald—I could not receive his call.

"Oh, St. John!" I cried. "have some mercy!"

I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued—

"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary's wife you must—shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service."

"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.

He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by them.Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him to its close—resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for him.

"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.Think like me, Jane—trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness."

"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary labours."

"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon—for I know your powers—you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."

"But my powers—where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light kindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths—the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"

"I have an answer for you—hear it. I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas—lucre had no undue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties—I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly. As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable."

My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.

"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.

"I can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that," I meditated—"that is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then? He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? My business is to live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him. Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, yes—and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him—to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations. If I do go with him—if I do make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.

"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item—one dreadful item. It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all. Unmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations—coolly put into practice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love—which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe—and know that the spirit was quite absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I will never undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him—not as his wife: I will tell him so."

I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column; his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He started to his feet and approached me.

"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."

"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."

"You have hitherto been my adopted brother—I, your adopted sister: let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."

He shook his head. "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case. If you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife.But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a moment—your strong sense will guide you."

I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so. "St. John," I returned, "I regard you as a brother—you, me as a sister: so let us continue."

"We cannot—we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it would not do. You have said you will go with me to India: remember—you have said that."

"Conditionally."

"Well—well. To the main point—the departure with me from England, the cooperation with me in my future labours—you do not object. You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view—how the work you have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of your great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that is a loose tie—but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."

I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold on my limbs.

"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."

"One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with the man's selfish senses—I wish to mate: it is the missionary."

"And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For them he has no use: I retain them."

"You cannot—you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."

"Oh! I will give my heart to God," I said. "You do not want it."

I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now, because I had not understood him. He had held me in awe, because he had held me in doubt.How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes. I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them.I understood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I. The veil fell from his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an equal—one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.

He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. "Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to me!" it seemed to say. "What does this signify?"

"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long; "one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once."

"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea his wife.Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as his wife—at his side always, and always restrained, and always checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital—this would be unendurable.

"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.

"Well?" he answered icily.

"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."

"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we be for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes—and unwed?"

"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself."

"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both. And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and—it would not do."

"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well. I have a woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more—don't fear."

"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I want.And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane, you would not repent marrying me—be certain of that; we must be married.I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your eyes."

"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. "I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it."

He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: he could command his countenance thoroughly.

"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."

I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.

"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If the reality were required, what should we do? How should we feel? My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage—forget it."

"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.Tomorrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight—take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"

He had done. Turning from me, he once more "looked to river, looked to hill."

But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected submission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathize: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.

That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I—who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.

"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in the passage expecting you—he will make it up."

I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him: he stood at the foot of the stairs.

"Good-night, St. John," said I.

"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.

"Then shake hands," I added.

What a cold, loose touch he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had with him—no cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.

And with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me down.





CHAPTER XXXV


He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.

Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.

He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.

All this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by force, but on principle.

The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship. I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.

"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us be friends."

"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.

"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that."

"Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all good."

"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers."

"Of course," he said. "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you as a stranger."

This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough.Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could. I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and principle. His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.

"Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"

He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.

"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you not go to India?"

"You said I could not unless I married you."

"And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?"

Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?

"No. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution."

The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash down.

"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.

"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply, because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me now."

His lips and cheeks turned white—quite white. "I should kill you—I am killing you? Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even until seventy-and-seven times."

I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.

"Now you will indeed hate me," I said. "It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."

A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.

"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not."

Most bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine. "And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.

"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.

A very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in him between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He spoke at last.

"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret—for your sake."

I interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once. "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense. You pretend to be shocked by what I have said. You are not really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife."

Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion perfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly—

"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With me, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor.Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."

Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much too despotic for the occasion. I replied—

"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case. I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.With you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."

"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.

"I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it."

"What do you mean?"

"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed."

"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it. You think of Mr. Rochester?"

It was true. I confessed it by silence.

"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"

"I must find out what is become of him."

"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a castaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen. But God sees not as man sees: His will be done."

He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.He was soon out of sight.

On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.

"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now. I am sure there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what.St. John is a strange being—"

She paused—I did not speak: soon she resumed—

"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed to any one else—to what end? I wish he loved you—does he, Jane?"

I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Di, not one whit."

"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side? Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him."

"He does—he has asked me to be his wife."

Diana clapped her hands. "That is just what we hoped and thought! And you will marry him, Jane, won't you? And then he will stay in England."

"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."

"What! He wishes you to go to India?"

"Yes."

"Madness!" she exclaimed. "You would not live three months there, I am certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"

"I have refused to marry him—"

"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.

"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him as his sister."

"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you undertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.St. John—you know him—would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?"

"Not as a husband."

"Yet he is a handsome fellow."

"And I am so plain you see, Di. We should never suit."

"Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta." And again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.

"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."

"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"

"You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He has told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Di, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"

"Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!"

"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.I know he would."

"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.

"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I will leave you, Diana." And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.

But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.

For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and tonight that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more thrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.

The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them, his eye had turned on me.

"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the unbelieving, etc., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."

Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.

A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader believed his name was already written in the Lamb's Book of Life, and he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.

In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weakhearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it, could not but feel it too.

The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.

"Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to do all things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent—resolve, while there is yet time.Remember, we are bid to work while it is day—warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.' Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!"

He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be sincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.

I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch. My refusals were forgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralyzed. The impossible—that is, my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion called—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a scroll—death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim room was full of visions.

"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer: it was only elevated.

"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered; "were I but convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now—come afterwards what would!"

"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, almost as if he loved me (I say almost—I knew the difference—for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. "Show me, show me the path!" I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge.

All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb. Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities. The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones.

"What have you heard? What do you see?" asked St. John. I saw nothing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry—

"Jane! Jane! Jane!"—nothing more.

"O God! what is it?" I gasped.

I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room, nor in the house, nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air, nor from under the earth, nor from overhead. I had heard it—where, or whence, for ever impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human being—a known, loved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.

"I am coming!" I cried. "Wait for me! Oh, I will come!" I flew to the door and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the garden: it was void.

"Where are you?" I exclaimed.

The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back, "Where are you?" I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland loneliness and midnight hush.

"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate. "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did—no miracle—but her best."

I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It was My time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and in force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way—a different way to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve—and lay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight.





CHAPTER XXXVI


The daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence. Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door: I feared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door. I took it up. It bore these words:





"You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the angel's crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight.Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak. I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, St. John."





"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty."

It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain beat fast on my casement. I heard the frontdoor open, and St. John pass out.Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross; there he would meet the coach.

"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought I; "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever."

It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in me—not in the external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.

"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them."

At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and should be absent at least four days.

"Alone, Jane?" they asked.

"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy."

They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.

It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.

I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at the foot of the signpost of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot, how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered, not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.

It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.

"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.

"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."

"My journey is closed," I thought to myself. I got out of the coach, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The Rochester Arms". My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it—

"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost your labour—you had better go no farther," urged the monitor. "Ask information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home."

The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them!

At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened. Another field crossed, a lane threaded, and there were the courtyard walls, the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. "My first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell—I am not certain. And if I did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south."

I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered station were at my command.

The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey. I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it. "What affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded; "what stupid regardlessness now?"

Hear an illustration, reader.

A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he can make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.

I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin.

No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.

And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even dumb sign, mute token.

In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence.Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?"

Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit down: I had some questions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.

"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.

"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."

"Did you?" Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.

"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.

The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been trying to evade.

"The late!" I gasped. "Is he dead?"

"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained. I breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words that Mr. Edward—my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman". Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since he was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.

"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he really was.

"No, ma'am—oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself."

"At dead of night!" I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield. "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.

"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware," he continued, edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?"

"I have heard something of it."

"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing."

I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the main fact.

"And this lady?"

"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—"

"But the fire," I suggested.

"I'm coming to that, ma'am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was after her continually. They used to watch him—servants will, you know, ma'am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him thought her so very handsome. She was a little small thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were bewitched. Well, he would marry her."

"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire. Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"

"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—she kept a private bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the chamber that had been the governess's—she was like as if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr.Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved it—she was a very good woman.Miss Adèle, a ward he had, was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall."

"What! did he not leave England?"

"Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to Thornfield Hall."

"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"

"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we heard him call 'Bertha!' We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the pavement."

"Dead?"

"Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were scattered."

"Good God!"

"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!" He shuddered.

"And afterwards?" I urged.

"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some bits of walls standing now."

"Were any other lives lost?"

"No—perhaps it would have been better if there had."

"What do you mean?"

"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my part."

"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.

"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better he dead."

"Why? How?" My blood was again running cold. "Where is he?" I demanded.

"Is he in England?"

"Ay—aye—he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy—he's a fixture now."

What agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it.

"He is stone-blind," he said at last. "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.Edward."

I had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned strength to ask what had caused this calamity.

"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way, ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before him.As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash—all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that also. He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a cripple."

"Where is he? Where does he now live?"

"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off: quite a desolate spot."

"Who is with him?"

"Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken down, they say."

"Have you any sort of conveyance?"

"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."

"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your postboy can drive me to Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire you usually demand."





CHAPTER XXXVII


The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers.He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.

To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain.The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it would far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.

I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.

I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate spot." It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.

"Can there be life here?" I asked.

Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.

It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.

I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.

His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.

And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?—If you do, you little know me. A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.

He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arm, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some quarter.

"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?"

"Let me alone," was the answer.

John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to walk about: vainly—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.

I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me. "Mary," I said, "how are you?"

She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried "Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?" I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John to go down to the turnpike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang.

"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak to him, but do not give my name."

"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."

When she returned, I inquired what he had said.

"You are to send in your name and your business," she replied. She then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.

"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.

"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."

"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."

I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my ribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.

This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room. His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands. I set it on the table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!" Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to see what the commotion was: but as he saw nothing, he returned and sighed.

"Give me the water, Mary," he said.

I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me, still excited.

"What is the matter?" he inquired.

"Down, Pilot!" I again said. He checked the water on its way to his lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. "This is you, Mary, is it not?"

"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.

He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, he did not touch me. "Who is this? Who is this?" he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to see with those sightless eyes—unavailing and distressing attempt! "Answer me—speak again!" he ordered, imperiously and aloud.

"Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the glass," I said.

"Who is it? What is it? Who speaks?"

"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this evening," I answered.

"Great God!—what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has seized me?"

"No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your health too sound for frenzy."

"And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever, whoever you are, be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!" He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.

"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers! If so there must be more of her." The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my shoulder, neck, waist—I was entwined and gathered to him.

"Is it Jane? What is it? This is her shape—this is her size—"

"And this her voice," I added. "She is all here: her heart, too. God bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again."

"Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre," was all he said.

"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I am come back to you."

"In truth?—in the flesh? My living Jane?"

"You touch me, sir,—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"

"My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream; such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus—and felt that she loved me, and trusted that she would not leave me."

"Which I never will, sir, from this day."

"Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—my life dark, lonely, hopeless—my soul athirst and forbidden to drink—my heart famished and never to be fed.Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before you go—embrace me, Jane."

"There, sir—and there!"

I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept his hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to arouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.

"It is you—is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?"

"I am."

"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"

"No, sir! I am an independent woman now."

"Independent! What do you mean, Jane?"

"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."

"Ah! this is practical—this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it. What, Janet!Are you an independent woman? A rich woman?"

"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want company of an evening."

"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?"

"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own mistress."

"And you will stay with me?"

"Certainly—unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your housekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your companion—to read to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so long as I live."

He replied not: he seemed serious—abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened his lips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a little embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly overleaped conventionalities; and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me closer.

"No—no—Jane; you must not go. No—I have touched you, heard you, felt the comfort of your presence—the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot give up these joys. I have little left in myself—I must have you. The world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame."

"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."

"Yes—but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand another. You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair—to wait on me as a kind little nurse—for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity, and that ought to suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so? Come, tell me."

"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if you think it better."

"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young—you must marry one day."

"I don't care about being married."

"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you care—but—a sightless block!"

He relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of conversation.

"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort. You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles' feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have not yet noticed."

"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me. "It is a mere stump—a ghastly sight! Don't you think so, Jane?"

"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes—and the scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well for all this; and making too much of you."

"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my cicatrised visage."

"Did you? Don't tell me so—lest I should say something disparaging to your judgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?"

"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze."

"And you see the candles?"

"Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud."

"Can you see me?"

"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."

"When do you take supper?"

"I never take supper."

"But you shall have some tonight. I am hungry: so are you, I dare say, only you forget."

Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine. Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his lineaments softened and warmed.

After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been, what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night. Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no fresh well of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits. If a moment's silence broke the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."

"You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?"

"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."

"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on my lone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."

"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."

"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past? Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again. Yes: for her restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight. How can it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she not depart as suddenly as she came? Tomorrow, I fear I shall find her no more."

A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this frame of mind. I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as ever.

"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me—passing like a shadow, whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?

"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"

"What for, Jane?"

"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie."

"Am I hideous, Jane?"

"Very, sir: you always were, you know."

"Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have sojourned."

"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life: quite more refined and exalted."

"Who the deuce have you been with?"

"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality."

"Who have you been with, Jane?"

"You shall not get it out of me tonight, sir; you must wait till tomorrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it. By-the-by, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham."

"You mocking changeling—fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as I have not felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp."

"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I'll leave you: I have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired. Good-night."

"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been?"

I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. "A good idea!" I thought with glee. "I see I have the means of fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come."

Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is Miss Eyre here?" Then: "Which room did you put her into? Was it dry? Is she up? Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."

I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered my presence. It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. He sat in his chair—still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness marking his strong features. His countenance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! It was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity I could.

"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said. "The rain is over and gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon."

I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.

"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not gone: not vanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays. All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to my ear—I am glad it is not naturally a silent one: all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence."

The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.

Most of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky. I sought a seat for him in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why should I, when both he and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet. He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms—

"Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now."

Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper than I wished.

I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my way: I should have told him my intention. I should have confided in him: he would never have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he had seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless on the wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed to him.

"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, etc. The accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due order. Of course, St.John Rivers' name came in frequently in the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately taken up.

"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"

"Yes."

"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"

"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."

"A good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty? Or what does it mean?"

"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."

"'Jeune encore,' as the French say. Is he a person of low stature, phlegmatic, and plain? A person whose goodness consists rather in his guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."

"He is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to perform."

"But his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well: but you shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"

"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point. His brain is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."

"Is he an able man, then?"

"Truly able."

"A thoroughly educated man?"

"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."

"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?—priggish and parsonic?"

"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentleman-like."

"His appearance—I forget what description you gave of his appearance; a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"

"St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile."

(Aside) "Damn him!"—(To me) "Did you like him, Jane?"

"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."

I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy had got hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy. I would not, therefore, immediately charm the snake.

"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was the next somewhat unexpected observation.

"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"

"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming contrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination—tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile. Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan—a real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the bargain."

"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan, sir."

"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go (and he retained me by a firmer grasp than ever), you will be pleased just to answer me a question or two." He paused.

"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"

Then followed this cross-examination.

"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his cousin?"

"Yes."

"You would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?"

"Daily."

"He would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be clever, for you are a talented creature!"

"He approved of them—yes."

"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."

"I don't know about that."

"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come there to see you?"

"Now and then?"

"Of an evening?"

"Once or twice."

A pause.

"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was discovered?"

"Five months."

"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"

"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the window, and we by the table."

"Did he study much?"

"A good deal."

"What?"

"Hindustani."

"And what did you do meantime?"

"I learnt German, at first."

"Did he teach you?"

"He did not understand German."

"Did he teach you nothing?"

"A little Hindustani."

"Rivers taught you Hindustani?"

"Yes, sir."

"And his sisters also?"

"No."

"Only you?"

"Only me."

"Did you ask to learn?"

"No."

"He wished to teach you?"

"Yes."

A second pause.

"Why did he wish it? Of what use could Hindustani be to you?"

"He intended me to go with him to India."

"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?"

"He asked me to marry him."

"That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex me."

"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."

"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the same thing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given you notice to quit?"

"Because I am comfortable there."

"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it is with this cousin—this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I thought my little Jane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another! But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."

"Shake me off, then, sir,—push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own accord."

"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so truthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that you have formed a new tie. But I am not a fool—go—"

"Where must I go, sir?"

"Your own way—with the husband you have chosen."

"Who is that?"

"You know—this St. John Rivers."

"He is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me: I do not love him. He loves—as he can love, and that is not as you love— a beautiful young lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would not have done. He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg.He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him.He has no indulgence for me—no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth—only a few useful mental points. Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"

I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but beloved master. He smiled.

"What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?"

"Absolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would be proud and content. All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever."

Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.

"My scared vision! My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.

I caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and wanted to speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek. My heart swelled.

"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut tree in Thornfield orchard," he remarked ere long.

"And what right would that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"

"You are no ruin, sir—no lightning truck tree: you are green and vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop."

Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.

"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.

"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.

"Ah! Jane. But I want a wife."

"Do you, sir?"

"Yes: is it news to you?"

"Of course: you said nothing about it before."

"Is it unwelcome news?"

"That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice."

"Which you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision."

"Choose then, sir—her who loves you best."

"I will at least choose—her I love best. Jane, will you marry me?"

"Yes, sir."

"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"

"Yes, sir."

"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait on?"

"Yes, sir."

"Truly, Jane?"

"Most truly, sir."

"Oh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!"

"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life—if ever I thought a good thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer—if ever I wished a righteous wish—I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth."

"Because you delight in sacrifice."

"Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for content. To be privileged to put my arms round what I value—to press my lips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."

"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."

"Which are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."

"Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit her?"

"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."

"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be married instantly."

He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.

"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the licence to get—then we marry."

"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me look at your watch."

"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no use for it."

"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir. Don't you feel hungry?"

"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."

"The sun has dried up all the raindrops, sir. The breeze is still: it is quite hot."

"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since the day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."

"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."

He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.

"Jane! you think me, I dare say, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower—breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff—necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it.Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. his chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of late—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.

"Some days since: nay, I can number them—four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy—sorrow, sullenness. I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that night—perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock—ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.

"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words—'Jane! Jane! Jane!'"

"Did you speak these words aloud?"

"I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."

"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"

"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point. You will think me superstitious—some superstition I have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is that I heard what I now relate.

"As I exclaimed 'Jane! Jane! Jane!' a voice—I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice it was—replied, 'I am coming: wait for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words, 'Where are you?'

"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express. Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating. 'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met.You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents—as certain as I live—they were yours!"

Reader, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it. I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural. I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.

"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise. Yes, I thank God!"

He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion.Only the last words of the worship were audible.

"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"

Then he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. We entered the wood, and wended homeward.





CHAPTER XXXVIII—CONCLUSION


Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manorhouse, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said—

"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning." The housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only—

"Have you, miss? Well, for sure!"

A short time after she pursued, "I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.

"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)—I knew what Mr.Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and he's done right, for aught I know. I wish you joy, miss!" and he politely pulled his forelock.

"Thank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."

I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words—

"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies." And again, "If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faàl and varry good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."

I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.

"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I read her letter to him; "If she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine."

How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind. He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

You have not quite forgotten little Adèle, have you, reader? I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the school where he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much. She looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy. I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another—my husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything that could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.

My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.

I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest—blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully is he is mine. No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character—perfect concord is the result.

Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand. Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw nature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round us—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad—because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.

One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said—

"Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?"

I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."

"And have you a pale blue dress on?"

I had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was sure of it.

He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him—the earth no longer a void. When his firstborn was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once were—large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.

My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man.Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.

As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says, "Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me." His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth—who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.

St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown. I know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this—

"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me. Daily He announces more distinctly, 'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly respond, 'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"
