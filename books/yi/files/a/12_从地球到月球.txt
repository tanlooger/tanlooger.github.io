第一章　大炮俱乐部


美国南北战争期间，马里兰州中部的巴尔的摩城新成立了一个颇具影响力的俱乐部。众所周知，那些船主、商贾和机械师的军事才能得到了多么大程度的发挥和展现。那些普普通通的商人，没有经过西点[1]的任何训练，便走出自己的商店，摇身一变，竟然变成了上尉、上校及将军。很快，他们便可以与他们欧洲大陆的同行们并驾齐驱、不相上下了，并且同他们一样，凭借在弹药、金钱和人力上的大量投入取得了一些胜利。

但是，在重炮射击学方面，美国人却远远超过欧洲人。这并不是说美国人的武器达到了一个更完美的程度，而是指他们的武器体积极大，因此射程极远，在当时绝无仅有。就平射、俯射、直射、斜射、纵射、反射而言，英国人、法国人、普鲁士人的技术均已达到臻于完美的程度；但是，他们的加农炮、榴弹炮、迫击炮与美国的巨型大炮相比就小巫见大巫了，如同一把小手枪一般。

对此，无人感到惊讶。如同意大利人深谙音乐，德国人擅长玄学一样，美国佬——这些世界上最早的技师——是天生的工程师。因此，当人们看到他们在重炮射击学方面大胆地运用聪明才智时，也就不以为奇了。大家知道，在这一方面，帕罗特、达尔格林、罗德曼等功不可没。而“阿姆斯特朗”、“帕利泽”和博利厄的“特勒伊”等大炮，在它们大洋彼岸的对手面前也只能甘拜下风，俯首称臣了。

每当一个美国人有了一个想法，他就会寻找另一个美国人来商讨这个想法；而一旦有了三个人，他们就会选出一个主席和两个秘书来。等有了四个人时，他们就任命一个资料保管员，办公室便开始运作了。等有了五个人时，他们便召开全体大会，俱乐部就宣告成立了。巴尔的摩城的俱乐部就是这样形成的。第一个设计新型大炮者，与第一个铸造该大炮以及第一个为之打孔的人相互合作。他们三人便成为大炮俱乐部的核心。俱乐部成立一个月后，拥有正式会员一千八百三十三人，通信会员三万零五百六十五人。

但凡想加入该俱乐部的人都必须具备一个条件，即设计过或至少改良过一门大炮；如果没有设计或改良过大炮，那么设计或改良过任何一种火器也可。不过，说实在的，那些设计过十五响左轮手枪、轮盘式卡宾枪或刀式手枪的人并不太受推崇，而炮弹专业人员总是备受青睐。

“他们所受到的敬重，”有一天，大炮俱乐部里最具才华的演说家中的一位说道，“是与他们的大炮的大小成正比的，而且与炮弹‘射程的平方数’相关！”

人们很容易想象得出，大炮俱乐部成立之后，美国人的创造才能在这一方面产生了多么大的效果。战争中使用的炮弹体积庞大，而且射程超出规定的距离，偶尔还会伤及无辜的平民百姓。所有这些发明将欧洲的那些简陋的武器装备远远地抛到了后面。

必须补充一句，这帮天不怕地不怕的美国佬，并不只是纸上谈兵，而且还身体力行，不怕牺牲自己的生命。他们中间有各种军阶的军官，有中尉，有将军；有年龄不一的军人，有刚入伍不久的新兵，也有老死在炮架旁的老兵。许多人都战死在了疆场，他们的名字被留在大炮俱乐部的光荣簿上，而大多数幸存者都伤痕累累，带有不容置疑的表明他们勇敢无畏的标记。拐杖、木腿、假臂、假手、橡胶下颌、银嵌头骨、铂金鼻子，应有尽有。统计学家皮特凯恩做过统计，在大炮俱乐部里，四个人加起来顶多只有一条胳膊，而六个人则仅有两条腿。

不过，这些勇敢的炮兵对死亡和伤残并不在意；而且，每当有关一场大战的报告说敌人死亡人数是他们所发射的炮弹数的十倍时，他们便会情不自禁地感到自豪。

可是，有一天，那是令人感到悲伤而凄凉的一天：战争的幸存者们签署了停战协议，隆隆炮声渐渐停息，迫击炮哑然无语，榴弹炮长期缄默无言，加农炮垂头丧气地返回武器库，炮弹码放在露天仓库中，腥风血雨的记忆逐渐淡去，棉株在施了大量肥料的棉田里茁壮生长，丧服因痛苦已不复存在而无须穿戴，大炮俱乐部的会员们深陷于极度的无所事事之中。

某些永不言弃的顽强者仍埋头致力于弹道计算中，他们仍在梦想着制造出一些巨型炸弹和无出其右的炮弹。但是，若无法付诸实践，那些空洞的理论又有何用？这么一来，俱乐部的大厅空无一人，仆人们在前厅里打盹儿，报纸放在桌子上发霉，昏暗的角落里传来阵阵忧伤的呼噜声，往日里大声嚷叫的大炮俱乐部的会员们现在被那令人丧气的和平局势弄得默然无语，沉浸在柏拉图式的梦幻之中。

“真丧气！”一天晚上，正直的汤姆·亨特把两条木腿对着吸烟室的壁炉口，边烤火边说道，“无所事事！毫无希望！好让人烦躁的日子！那些每天清晨被欢快的炮声唤醒的日子哪里去了？”

“那种日子已不复存在了。”乐呵呵的比尔斯比一边试图伸伸他那两条已不存在了的胳膊，一边回答道，“那时候可真开心呀！我们设计大炮，一铸造好，便跑去对准敌人试射。然后，带着谢尔曼[2]的鼓励或麦克莱伦[3]的祝贺返回军营。可是，如今，将军们全都解甲归田了，不再弄枪动炮，而是侍弄他们那没有攻击力的棉桃了！啊！圣巴比[4]！难道炮弹的未来就这样断送在美国了吗！”

“看来没有什么可打的仗了！”大名鼎鼎的J.T.马斯顿一边用铁钩手挠着他那古塔橡胶修补的脑壳一边说道，“远方没有一丝战争的阴云，而现在大炮科学正是大有作为的时候呀！我跟你们说吧，今天早上，我弄好了一份图纸，是关于能够改变战况的迫击炮的，还附有平面图、剖面图和正视图！”

“是吗？”汤姆·亨特一边应声一边情不自禁地回想起令人尊敬的J.T.马斯顿的上一次试验来。J.T.马斯顿当时发明的一种大炮，在第一次试验时就炸死了三百三十七个人。

“是呀。”J.T.马斯顿回答道，“可是，我们研究了那么久，效果又那么好，而且还克服了重重困难，又有什么用呢？这不是白白地浪费时间和精力吗？‘新大陆’的人民好像商量好了要和平地生活，就连我们那好战的《论坛报》[5]都在预测因人口的骤增将导致的灾难了！”

“不过，马斯顿，”布洛姆斯贝瑞上校说道，“在欧洲，人们仍在为维护民族自治而奋斗呢！”

“那又能怎样呀？”

“又能怎样？说不定在那儿可以尝试点儿什么，而如果他们想要我们效力的话——”

“你想什么呢？”比尔斯比大声说道，“研究弹道学为外国人谋福利？”

“这总比什么也不干好。”上校回答道。

“那倒是，”J.T.马斯顿说，“不过，这只是权宜之计，不应该考虑。”

“为什么呀？”上校问道。

“因为在欧洲大陆，他们对于晋升的看法与我们美国人的思维习惯大相径庭。他们那种人想象不出没有当过少尉就能当上将军，也就是说，没有亲手铸造过大炮的人就不能成为一个神炮手！”

“荒谬至极！”汤姆·亨特一边用鲍伊猎刀[6]划着扶手椅的扶手一边反驳道，“这么说来，我们只好去种烟草或去熬鲸鱼油了！”

“什么？”J.T.马斯顿扯起嗓门儿大声吼道，“难道我们下半生就不再去研究武器的改进了？我们就不去找机会来试验我们大炮的射程了？天空就不再被我们的炮火照亮了？就再也不会出现国际矛盾让我们向大洋彼岸的某个强国宣战了？法国人将不会击沉我们的任何船只，英国人也不会再蔑视人权绞死我们的国民了？”

“对，马斯顿，”布洛姆斯贝瑞上校回答道，“我们不会有这种运气了！不会了！再也不会了！而且，就算会有这种机会，我们可能也利用不上了！美国人的火气日益消退了，我们成了受气包了！”

“太对了，”J.T.马斯顿激动地说道，“世界上有成千个打仗的理由，可他们就是不打！人们不想丢胳膊断腿，而这正对那些不会打仗的人的心思！喏，用不着跑老远去找什么打仗的由头，北美从前不就隶属英国人吗？”

“那倒是。”汤姆·亨特用他的拐杖狠狠地捅了捅炉火，回应道。

“对呀！”J.T.马斯顿又说，“为什么就不能轮到英国隶属美国人呢？”

“这样倒公平。”布洛姆斯贝瑞上校说道。

“去向美国总统建议吧，”J.T.马斯顿嚷嚷道，“看他会怎么对待你们！”

“他是不会给我们好脸色的。”比尔斯比用他那在战争中幸存的只有四颗牙齿的嘴嘟嘟囔囔地说。

“看着吧，”J.T.马斯顿嚷叫道，“下次选举时，他就甭想让我投他的票了。”

“也别指望我们把票投给他了。”这些好战的残疾人异口同声道。

“现在，”J.T.马斯顿说，“总而言之，如果不给我提供在战场上试验我的新式迫击炮的机会，我就退出大炮俱乐部，到阿肯色州的大草原上去隐居！”

“我们跟您一起去。”勇敢的J.T.马斯顿的同伴们一致回答说。

众人说到这里，情绪越来越激昂，俱乐部正面临散伙的危机。但就在这时，一件意想不到的事情阻止了这一不幸灾难的发生。

就在他们这次交谈后的第二天，大炮俱乐部的每个成员都收到了一份通知，上面写道：

作为大炮俱乐部的主席，我荣幸地通知诸位：在本月五日的会议上，我将宣布一个大家非常感兴趣的消息。因此，我请求大家拨冗莅临。顺致诚挚的敬意！

大炮俱乐部主席　因比·巴比凯恩

十月三日于巴尔的摩





第二章　巴比凯恩的报告


十月五日晚八点，位于联合广场二十一号的大炮俱乐部里，所有的厅堂都挤满了人。住在巴尔的摩的所有俱乐部会员应主席之邀，全都参加了会议。至于通信会员，有数百人之多，全都搭车拥入该城，出现在各条街道上。尽管会议厅很大，但这些科学家仍然无法觅得一个座位，因此，他们只好挤到隔壁的厅室里，或待在走廊尽头，甚至拥到庭院中去。他们和一群普通民众聚集在庭院门口，人人都试图挤到院门前。他们彼此拥来挤去，互不相让，都想挤到前几排；他们以自治政府教育影响下的独特的自由方式，推啊，挤啊，撞啊，急切地想听到巴比凯恩主席的重要报告。

那天晚上，一个待在当地的外地人，即使出再高的价钱也无法获准进入会议大厅。会议大厅是专供当地会员或通信会员进入的，其他各色人等均不得入内，甚至该城的名流、民选的市政官员也不例外。他们不得不挤在市民中间，竖起耳朵来听从大厅传来的报告声。

可是，这个宽敞的大厅呈现出的竟是一幅奇特的景象。宽大的会场完全符合它的用途。高大的柱子是用加农炮码放成的，基座则是粗大的迫击炮。这些柱子支撑着穹顶的精美铁架，那是一些用冲头冲制成的铸铁花边。墙上陈列着老式短铳、老式火枪、喇叭口火枪、卡宾枪等各种各样旧式的和新式的火器，错落有致，蔚为壮观。由上千支手枪拼成的一只只枝形吊灯用煤气点燃，照亮了大厅。同时，用手枪组成的多枝烛台和用步枪捆成束组成的大烛台被点燃了，让大厅更加灯火辉煌。大炮模型、青铜炮样品、被子弹打得千疮百孔的靶子、被俱乐部的大炮炮弹击碎的钢板、一套套的送弹棍和炮膛刷、一排排的炸弹、一圈圈的火箭炮、一串串的炮弹，总之，炮手的所有工具都摆放得十分醒目，令人大开眼界，而且也让人联想到这些武器弹药摆放在那儿，更多的是为了装饰而非杀戮。

在大厅较远的一头，俱乐部主席由四位秘书陪同，占了一个很大的平台。他的椅子高踞于一个雕花炮架上，整体看去，呈现出一门三十二寸[7]迫击炮的强大形象。它装在转轴上，可以转动九十度，主席因而可以像坐在转椅上似的左右转动，这在炎热天气下，是很舒服的。在以六门大口径、短炮身的海军大炮支撑着的宽大钢板办公桌上，可以看到一个精心雕刻的、用远程大口径火铳炮弹制成的别具一格的墨水瓶，以及一只形似手枪、可以摇出当当响声的铃铛。在争论激烈时，这只新颖别致的铃铛的铃声勉勉强强地可以盖过情绪激动的炮手们的嚷叫声。

宽大的桌子前面摆放着一条条长凳，宛如防御工事的封锁壕，呈之字形排列，形成一座座碉堡和碉堡护墙，上面坐着大炮俱乐部的全体会员。那天晚上，可以说，“碉堡上坐满了人”。大家比较了解主席，知道若不是特别严重的情况，他是不会惊扰他的同事们的。

因比·巴比凯恩年已四十，沉着、冷静、严肃、严谨、专注，犹如一架精密计时器一般准确。他性格坚定，坚韧不拔，经得起各种考验，虽然缺少骑士风度，但不失冒险精神，并且，即使是在最大胆的行动中也很注意实事求是。他是新英格兰的一位杰出之人，北方殖民主义者，斯图亚特王朝的死对头——圆颅党人[8]——的后裔，是祖国旧时骑兵——南方绅士们——不共戴天的敌人。总之，他是一个地地道道的美国佬。

巴比凯恩曾经营木材生意，赚了一大笔钱；战争期间被委任为制炮业的主管，创造力极其丰富；他想法大胆，为大炮这种武器的发展做出了巨大的贡献，并极大地推动了大炮的试验工作。

此人中等身材，四肢健全，这在大炮俱乐部的所有会员中是一个罕见的例外。他面部轮廓分明，好似用角尺和直尺勾画出来的一般。如果真的要猜测一个人的本性就必须看他的侧影的话，那么，从侧面看过去，巴比凯恩显现出的最明显的特质是精力充沛、大胆和冷静。

此时此刻，他坐在扶手椅里，一动不动，沉默不语，全神贯注，陷入沉思中，眼睛似乎是被一顶美国人常戴的黑缎圆筒高顶礼帽遮住。

当大厅里的钟当当地敲了八下时，巴比凯恩像身上装有弹簧似的突然站了起来。大厅里顿时鸦雀无声，演说家巴比凯恩便用一种略带夸张的声调说道：

“正直的同事们，很久以来，一种毫无意义的和平让我们大炮俱乐部的会员们陷入了恼人的无所事事之中。这几年来，经历了如此多的事故之后，我们只好撇下我们的工作，在前进的路上陡然停下。我不害怕大声宣布，任何能让我们重新拿起武器的战争都是很受欢迎的！”（热烈的掌声）“可是，战争，先生们，在目前的形势下，战争是不可能爆发的。无论我们多么殷切地盼望，离我们的大炮在战场上再次怒吼起来，还有一段很长的时间。因此，我们必须拿定主意，想方设法在其他领域寻找我们的出路。”

全体听讲者都感觉到他们的主席就要谈及那个敏感的问题了，所以大家便竖起耳朵，注意听下去。

“几个月来，我正直的同事们，”巴比凯恩继续说道，“我一直在想，我们是不是可以在我们的专业领域搞点儿什么无愧于十九世纪的伟大试验？我们是不是可以把弹道学的进步引向成功的目标？于是，我进行了研究、探索、计算，从而坚定了自己的信念，那就是我们将在一项任何其他国家似乎完全无法行得通的事业中获得成功。这个计划我已拟出很久了，我今天就要向大家汇报。该计划无愧于诸位，无愧于大炮俱乐部昔日的辉煌，它肯定会在全世界引起轰动！”

全场的人都感到心情十分激动。

巴比凯恩动作麻利而坚定地戴好帽子，用平静的语气继续他的报告：

“正直的同事们，你们中间没有人没见过月亮，起码没有谁没听说过它。我在此跟你们谈论月亮，请你们不要感到惊讶。它也许能让我们成为那个未知世界的‘哥伦布’。请大家理解我，竭尽全力帮助我，我将带领大家去征服它，让它的名字加入组成我们这个伟大的合众国的三十六个州来。”

“月亮万岁！”大炮俱乐部的会员们齐声欢呼道。

“人们对月球进行过大量的研究，”巴比凯恩继续说道，“它的质量、密度、重量、体积、结构、运动规律、和地球之间的距离以及在太阳系中的作用等都完全被确定了。人们已经绘制出了月面图，即使不超过地面图，至少也与后者一样完美。所拍摄到的月球照片显示出这颗地球卫星美不胜收。总而言之，关于月亮，数学、天文学、地质学和光学所能告诉我们的，我们全都一清二楚了。但是，迄今为止，我们还从未与月球进行过直接的联系。”

主席的这番话引起了与会者们强烈的兴趣，令他们非常吃惊。

“请允许我，”巴比凯恩继续说道，“与大家一起简短地回顾一下一些头脑发热、一门心思幻想着做月球旅行的人，是如何吹嘘自己已经探测到这颗地球卫星的秘密的。十七世纪时，一个名叫大卫·法布里丘斯的人，大言不惭地说自己亲眼见到了月球上的居民。一六四九年，一个名叫让·博杜安的法国人发表了由西班牙探险家写的《多明戈·冈萨雷斯月球旅行记》。同一时期，西拉诺·德·贝热拉克出版了一本《月球游记》，在法国获得了巨大成功。这之后，另一个名叫封特奈尔的法国人（这些人都非常关注月球），写了一本名为《宇宙多样性》的书，成为当时的名著。一八三五年左右，译自《美国的纽约》的一本小册子[9]中讲到，被派往好望角搞天文学研究的约翰·赫歇尔[10]先生，借助一架可以内部照明的天文望远镜，把月球与地球的距离缩短到了八十码[11]。因此，他有可能清晰地看到河马出没的岩洞、镶着金边的青山、长着象牙角的绵羊、白色的狍子、长着类似蝙蝠膜翅的居民。这本小册子是一个名叫洛克的美国人的作品，获得了很大成功。在结束这段短暂的回顾之前，我还想补充一点：鹿特丹的一个名叫汉斯·普法尔的人，钻进一只灌满了从氮气中提取的气体的气球中（这种气体的密度是氢气的三十八分之一），在飞行了十九天之后，到达了月球。这次飞行如同前面所讲的那些尝试一样，纯属幻想，但是，那却是在美国深受读者欢迎的作家的作品，我说的是埃德加·坡[12]！”

“埃德加·坡万岁！”与会者们被主席的演讲鼓动得大声呼喊道。

“关于前人所做的尝试，我就说到这儿，”巴比凯恩说道，“这些我认为是纯文学性的探索，它们根本就无法达成与月球的真正联系。不过，我应该补充一句，有几位认真求实的人试过与月球进行真切的联系。比如，几年前，一位德国的几何学家就建议过，派遣一个科考团前往西伯利亚大草原，在那辽阔的原野上，建起一些巨大的用反射灯光映现出的几何图形，其中包括被法国人俗称为‘驴桥’的弦的正方形。这位几何学家说：‘但凡聪明的人都应该懂得这个图形的科学用途。如果真的存在月球居民的话，他们就会用相似的图形来回答，而交流一旦建立起来，就将很容易地创造一个字母表，就能与月球居民进行沟通了。’这位德国几何学家这么说了，但他却并未将这个计划付诸实践；而直至今日，地球同它的卫星月球也从未建立起任何的直接联系。这正好让美国人的应用才能得以发挥，去同星星的世界建立联系。达到此目的的方法既简单、容易，又可靠且万无一失，这也是我提议的目的。”

主席的这番话引得全场欢声雷动，与会者没有一个不为演讲者的话所折服、所吸引、所着迷。

当乱哄哄的会场安静下来之后，巴比凯恩用更严肃的声音继续他那被打断的演讲。

“大家知道，”他说，“这几年来，弹道学取得了什么样的进步；而且，如果战争继续下去的话，武器将会达到什么样的完美程度。大家也同样知道，一般来说，大炮的后坐力和炸药的爆炸力是无限的。喏，根据这一原理，我曾想过，假设能弄到一种具备某种确定的后坐力的合适装置的话，是否可能将一颗炮弹打到月球上去。”

听他这么一说，从众人那呼吸急促的胸膛里发出了一片惊愕的“啊”声，随即便是一片寂静，仿佛暴风雨来临前的沉寂一般。确实，过了一会儿，暴风雨突然来临了，不过那是掌声、叫喊声、嘈杂声混合而成的“雷鸣声”，震颤了整个大厅。主席想继续讲下去，却无法办到。足足过了十分钟，他才终于让大家安静下来，听他继续往下讲。

“请让我讲完，”巴比凯恩冷静地说道，“我把这个问题的方方面面全都考虑过了，并且认真细致地进行了研究。我的缜密的计算表明，任何一颗射向月球的炮弹，如果它的初速度达到每秒一万两千码的话，就肯定可以到达月球。因此，我荣幸地建议大家，我正直的同事们，来尝试一下这个小小的试验！”





第三章　巴比凯恩报告的影响


我们无法描述尊敬的大炮俱乐部主席的最后一席话所产生的影响。呼喊声、叫嚷声、喝彩声、“噢”“啊”声，以及美国英语中的各种象声词响成一片，声震屋瓦！会场上的混乱、喧闹难以形容！人们嘴里喊着，脚在跺着。即使这座大炮博物馆的所有武器一起开火，也不会造成这么大的声响。这倒也不足为奇，因为有些炮手的嗓门儿几乎同他们的大炮一样响。

在这片热情高涨的喧闹声中，巴比凯恩保持着冷静。他也许还想向他的同事们说点儿什么，因为他还在做着手势，让大家安静下来，他把声音清脆响亮的铃铛当当地摇个不停。但是，大家根本就听不见他的铃声。很快，他便被人从座位上拽起来，高高地抬起，忠实的同事们将他从激动不已的人群中传递开去。

美国人是不信邪的。人们常常说法语中不存在“不可能”这个词，他们想必是查错了字典。其实在美国才是这样，一切都很容易，一切都很简单；至于那些所谓的机械难题，没等它们出现便已胎死腹中了。在巴比凯恩的计划与它的实施之间，没有哪个真正的美国佬会感到存在着困难。他们一言既出，万难皆消。

巴比凯恩的庆祝游行一直持续到深夜。那是一次真正的火炬游行。爱尔兰人、德国人、法国人、苏格兰人，住在马里兰州的各个种族的所有居民都在用各自的母语叫喊着，激情昂扬地欢呼着，亢奋不已。

月亮好像明白了这一切与自己相关似的，皎洁的光、平静地照耀着大地，让它周围的光亮都黯然失色。美国佬们全都抬头望着那明亮的月亮。有人向它挥手致意，有人则用各种可爱的名字呼唤它。从晚上八点到午夜，琼斯富尔街的一个光学仪器商靠卖望远镜发了笔财。

午夜的钟声已经敲响，但人们高涨的热情并未减退。各阶层的群众皆是如此：科学家、小商贩、零售商、搬运工，聪明人和稚嫩者，都感到触动了自己的心弦。这是一件全国性的大事，因此，上城、下城、帕塔普斯科河附近码头上和船坞里停泊着的船只，全都被灌满了杜松子酒和威士忌的欢快的、兴奋的人们给挤得满满当当的。无论是懒散地躺在酒吧的长沙发上喝着雪利酒的绅士们，还是在费尔波因的阴暗小酒馆里被低廉的烈酒灌得醉醺醺的水手们，全都在交谈着、争论着、讨论着，掌声热烈，赞叹声不断。

大约深夜两点钟光景，激动的人们平静了下来。巴比凯恩主席总算回到了家里，他已精疲力竭，疲惫不堪，全身快要散架了。即使是一个大力士，也经不住这样的狂热。人群渐渐地从广场和大街上散去。从费城、华盛顿、哈里斯堡和惠灵通往巴尔的摩的四条铁路把这些各个种族的人送到美国各地之后，巴尔的摩城才较为安静了些。

翌日，一千五百家报纸和杂志，无论是日报、周刊、月刊或半月刊都在关注这个问题。它们从政治角度或文明角度，从物理学、气象学、经济学或伦理学等方面对之进行了分析。它们在探讨月球是否已经完善，是否不会再有任何变化。它是不是类似于大气层尚不存在时期的地球？它那从地球上看不到的那一面是什么样子的？尽管只是想向月球发射一颗炮弹，但是大家都从中看到，那是一系列试验的开始。大家都在期盼着有一天，美国能洞悉这个神秘星球最深奥的秘密；有些人甚至好像还很担心征服月球会不会明显地打破欧洲的平衡。

经过分析讨论，没有哪家报纸、杂志对成功征服月球心存疑虑。各种汇编、小册子、简报，以及由科学家、文学家或宗教人士等团体出版的杂志，都在强调并指出这一计划的亮点。而波士顿的自然史协会、奥尔巴尼的美国科学艺术协会、纽约的地理统计协会、费城的美国哲学协会、华盛顿的史密森学会则向大炮俱乐部发出了上千封祝贺信，并表示愿意立即提供人力和资金方面的援助。

因此，因比·巴比凯恩从当日起，便成了美国最伟大的公民之一，有点儿像是科学界的华盛顿；而这一例证是众多例证之一，它将表明一国民众对某一个人会致以多么崇高的敬意。

那次大炮俱乐部著名的会议之后没几天，一家英国剧团的经理便宣布，在巴尔的摩剧场将演出《无事生非》[13]。但是，巴尔的摩的市民们发现此剧有影射巴比凯恩主席的方案之嫌，便闯入剧场，砸毁座椅，并逼迫倒霉的经理改换剧目。经理是个明白人，顺从了公众的意愿，用《皆大欢喜》[14]替换了前面那个不合时宜的剧目。一连数周，这位经理都获得了惊人的收入。





第四章　剑桥天文台的回复


不过，巴比凯恩并未因受到众人的欢呼而忘乎所以。他首先要做的，是把他的同事们召集到大炮俱乐部的办公室里来。在那儿，经过一番讨论，大家同意就方案的天文学部分请教一下天文学家。等天文学家的回音一到，大家就将着手讨论机械装备的问题；而且，为保证这一伟大试验的成功，任何细节都不可疏忽。

于是，一份包括一些专业问题的十分明确的纪要便拟好了，寄给了位于马萨诸塞州的剑桥天文台[15]。剑桥城是美国第一所大学的诞生地，而且也正是因为它的天文台而享誉世界。那儿聚集着一些顶尖的科学家；那里的一台高性能望远镜使邦德[16]解析了仙女座星云，使克拉克发现了天狼星。这座著名的天文台完全值得大炮俱乐部信赖。

两天后，大家焦急不安等待着的回信寄到了巴比凯恩主席的手中。内容如下：

剑桥天文台台长致巴尔的摩大炮俱乐部主席：

您本月六日以巴尔的摩大炮俱乐部全体会员的名义，寄给剑桥天文台的信函，我台业已收悉。我们立即开了会，并做出如下我们认为较为合适的答复。

您提出的问题归纳如下：

1.可不可能向月球发射一颗炮弹？

2.地球与它的这颗卫星的精确距离是多少？

3.在给炮弹以足够的初速度的情况下，它能飞行多长时间？而为了让它落在月球上的某一个特定地点，应该何时发射为好？

4.炮弹落在月球上的最佳位置应该是在什么时候？

5.发射炮弹的大炮应该对准天空中的哪一个点？

6.炮弹射出时，月球将在天空中的什么位置？

就第一个问题：可不可能向月球发射一颗炮弹？现回答如下。

可以。如果能使炮弹的初速度达到每秒一万二千码的话，就可以向月球发射。经过计算，这一速度足够了。随着物体离开地球，地心引力的作用与距离的平方成反比，因而引力在逐渐减小，也就是说，如果距离变为原来的三倍，这一引力就将减小到原来的九分之一。因此，炮弹的重量在迅速减小，到月球的引力与地球的引力持平的时候，也就是说，在射程达到五十二分之四十七的时候，炮弹的重量就会减少到零。这时，炮弹就不再有重量了。如果它超越了这个点，它就将在唯一的月球的引力之下落在月球上。试验的理论性完全得到了验证。至于成功与否，那就只取决于发射装置的功率了。

就第二个问题：地球与它的这颗卫星的精确距离是多少？现回答如下。

月球围绕地球运转的轨迹并不是圆形的，而是椭圆形的，我们的地球占据着这个椭圆中心中的一个，因此，月球有时离地球较近，有时又较远；用天文学术语来说就是，时而在远地点，时而在近地点。可是，最大距离与最小距离之间的差距是很大的，大到不容我们忽略。事实上，在远地点时，月球距离地球二十四万七千五百五十二英里；而在近地点时，距离则只有二十一万八千六百五十七英里，相差两万八千八百九十五英里，超过总射程的九分之一。因此，近地点的距离应该作为考虑的基础。

就第三个问题：在给炮弹以足够的初速度的情况下，它能飞行多长时间？而为了让它落在月球上的某一个特定地点，应该何时发射为好？现回答如下。

如果炮弹始终保持发射时的初速度——每秒一万二千码的话，它大约只需九个多小时便可到达目的地。但是，由于这个初速度将逐渐减小，经过推算，炮弹将要花费三十万秒，亦即八十三小时二十分，才能到达地球引力和月球引力相抵消的点。然后，从这个点起，它将在五万秒之后，亦即十三小时五十三分二十秒之后落到月球上。因此，应该在炮弹将到达月球上的那个瞄准点之前的九十七小时十三分二十秒之前发射它。

就第四个问题：炮弹落在月球的最佳位置应该是在什么时候？现回答如下。

根据刚才上面所说的，首先必须选择月球在近地点的时刻，同时也要是它通过天顶[17]的时刻，这将能够减少相当于一个地球半径的距离，亦即三千九百一十九英里；这样的话，最终射程则为二十一万四千九百七十六英里。不过，如果说月球每月都经过近地点的话，那它并不是在这一时刻总是处在天顶。而这两个条件同时具备的话，必须有一个很长的间隔。因此，必须等待月球到达近地点同时又在天顶的时刻的到来。不过，巧得很，明年十二月四日，月球将正好具备这两个条件：午夜时分，它将到达它的近地点，也就是说离地球最近的距离；与此同时，它又经过天顶。

就第五个问题：发射炮弹的大炮应该对准天空中的哪一个点？现回答如下。

根据上述看法，大炮应该瞄准天顶，这样，炮弹飞出时与地平线呈垂直状，它因此也就能尽快地摆脱地球引力。不过，要使这种情况出现，即月球到达天空最高点的话，就必须让这个地方的纬度不高于地球的赤纬[18]，也就是说，它必须位于北纬或南纬的0°至28°之间。在其他任何地点，就必须倾斜发射，而这就可能影响试验的成功。

就第六个问题：炮弹射出时，月球将在天空中的什么位置？现回答如下。

当炮弹将向天空发射时，每天以十三度十分三十五秒向前运行的月球，应该出现在离天顶是这个度数四倍距离的地方，亦即五十二度四十二分二十秒的地方，这一空间正好符合炮弹轨迹中月球的运行路线。不过，由于必须同时考虑到地球自转所引发的炮弹的偏差，而且还由于炮弹只是经过一个相当于十六个地球半径的偏差距离之后才到达月球（从月球轨道来看，这个偏差大约为十一度），因此，我们必须把这十一度加到所提及的月球离天空最高点的距离中去，变为六十四度整。这样一来，在发射炮弹时，月球视线方位将与发射点的垂直线构成一个六十四度的夹角。

这就是剑桥天文台对大炮俱乐部的会员们提出的问题的回复。

概括起来，就是：

1.大炮必须安放在一个北纬或南纬0°至28°之间的地方。

2.大炮必须瞄准天空最高点。

3.炮弹的初速度必须达到每秒一万二千码。

4.炮弹应该在明年十二月一日晚上十点四十六分四十秒发射。

5.炮弹将于发射后的第四天，即精确时间十二月四日午夜时分，在通过天空最高点时到达月球。

因此，大炮俱乐部的会员们应该立即着手进行这样的一次试验所必需的工作，做好在规定时刻发射的准备；因为如果错过了十二月四日这个日期的话，那就必须等到十八年零十一天以后，才能遇上月球同时符合既位于近地点又处在天空最高点的条件。

剑桥天文台愿意毫无保留地回答所有有关天文学理论方面的问题，并与全国人民一起恭祝诸位马到成功。

第五章　月球的传说


一位目光极其敏锐的观察家，置身于宇宙围绕运转的这个未知的中心的话，就会看到无数的原子充满了宇宙混沌时期的空间。但是，随着时间的推移，渐渐地发生了一个变化：一个引力定律出现了，此前一直游离着的原子都遵守着这一定律。这些原子根据其相似性以化学的方式进行组合，构成分子，并形成模糊的星团，散布于天空深处。这些星团立刻开始围绕它们的中心点旋转起来。这个由一些模糊的分子组成的中心开始自转，同时逐渐地凝聚在一起。另外，根据力学不变定律，随着凝结所导致的体积的缩小，它的旋转速度在加快；而在这两种变化持续不断的作用下，便形成了一个主星，即模糊星团的中心。

观察家如果仔细观察，就会看到星团的其他那些分子也像主星一样，通过逐渐加速的旋转凝聚起来，形成无数的星体，围绕着主星转动。于是，星云就形成了。据天文学家统计，现在有大约五千个星云。

在这五千个星云中，有一个星云被人们称为“银河”，它包含着一千八百万颗星星，其中的每一颗星星都变成了某个太阳系的中心。

如果观察家专注于这一千八百万颗星星中最普通、最暗淡的星中的一颗四等星，也就是被人们自豪地称为“太阳”的那一颗的话，那么宇宙形成的所有现象都会相继呈现在他的眼前。其实，这个太阳还处于气体状态，由一些活动的分子组成，观察家会发现它绕着自身的轴心在旋转，最后凝聚起来。这一运动遵循着力学原理，随着体积的缩小，它的旋转速度在加快；到了某一时刻，离心力便会胜过把分子吸向中心的向心力。

这时，另一种现象就会出现在观察家的眼前：位于赤道表面的分子像投石器的绳子断了之后的石子似的纷纷飞了出去，在太阳周围形成好多土星光环似的同心圆圈。而这些宇宙物质组成的光环在围着一个中心旋转，分裂成一个个雾状星云，即行星。假如观察家集中注意力观察这些行星的话，就会发现它们产生了一个或多个宇宙物质组成的光环，这就是人们称为卫星的低级天体的起源。

因此，从原子到分子，从分子到星团，从星团到星云，从星云到主星，从主星到太阳，从太阳到行星，从行星到卫星，人们看到自宇宙初期开始天体经历的一系列演变。

被太阳通过万有引力束缚在它们的椭圆形轨道上的这些小行星，有几个也有它们自己的卫星。天王星有八个，土星有八个，木星有四个，海王星可能有三个，地球有一个。最后的这一个是整个太阳系中最微不足道的一个，名叫月球，而大胆的美国人声称要征服的正是它。

由于离我们相对而言比较近，而且它的不同的月相更替又很快，所以这个星球首先吸引了地球居民们的注意。

从公元前五世纪的米利都的泰勒斯[19]到公元十五世纪的哥白尼，到公元十六世纪的第谷·布拉赫，人们不断地进行观测工作，得出的结论或多或少是正确的，而直到今天月球上山脉的精确高度才被确定下来。伽利略根据月球上山脉的存在阐释了某些相位的光现象，他认为这些山脉的平均高度为四千五百托瓦兹[20]。在伽利略之后，但泽[21]的一位名为埃沃利尤斯的天文学家，认为这些山脉的平均高度只有两千六百托瓦兹。但是，他的同行里西奥利却认为它们的平均高度有七千托瓦兹。

十八世纪末，赫歇尔借助一台高倍天文望远镜，又将这些山脉的测量数据大大地缩减了。他认为最高的那些山脉只有一千九百托瓦兹，认为高低不平的山脉的平均高度仅四百托瓦兹而已。不过，赫歇尔还是弄错了。后来，经哈利、内史密斯、比安奇尼、格鲁伊修森等诸多天文学家的观测，特别是经过比尔先生和麦德莱先生孜孜不倦的探求，这个关于山脉的高度问题才最终得到解决。比尔先生和麦德莱先生一共测量了一千九百零五座山，其中有六座超过两千六百托瓦兹，有二十二座超过两千四百托瓦兹。其中最高的山峰以三千八百零一托瓦兹的高度俯视着月球表面。与此同时，对月球的了解变得完整了。这颗星球上遍布着火山口，它的火山特性在每一次观测中都表现得很明显。由于被它遮挡住的行星的星光并没有折射，我们可以推定，月球上几乎没有空气。没有空气，导致了水的缺失。因此，显而易见，月球人在这种条件下生存，就必须具有独特的身体结构，与地球人迥然不同才行。

总之，由于采用了新的方法，加上新的仪器又更加完善，月球被不断地探测着，它的表面没有一处未被探测到。月球的直径为两千一百五十英里[22]，表面积是地球表面积的十三分之一[23]，体积为地球这个扁球体的四十九分之一，它的任何秘密都无法逃过天文学家们的眼睛；而且，这些聪明过人的科学家将更加深入地进行惊人的观察。

通过观测，他们发现满月时，月面的某些部分会出现白色条纹；而在不同月相时，出现的则是黑色条纹。经过更加仔细而精确的研究，他们终于完全弄清楚了这些条纹的性质。这是一些狭长的沟槽，凹陷于两条平行边之间，一般来说，一直延伸至火山口的周围；它们的长度在十到一百英里之间，宽八百托瓦兹。天文学家把它们称为沟槽，不过，他们能够做到的，也只能是给它们取这么个名称。至于这些沟槽是不是从前的河流干涸后的河床，他们就说不清楚了。

因此，美国人希望有一天能弄清楚这一地质现象。他们也希望有一天能搞明白，被格鲁伊修森这位来自慕尼黑的博学的教授在月球表面上发现的一系列平行壁垒系统的真正本质。这位教授把它们看作月球工程师们所构筑的防御工事系统。这两个问题悬而未决。当然还有其他的一些问题，只有在与月球建立起直接的联系之后，才能彻底解决。

至于月光的强度，已不再有任何的疑问了。人们已经知道，月光的强度是太阳光强度的三十万分之一，而且月亮的热力对温度计不起作用；至于那个被称为“灰光”的现象，当然是太阳光射向地球后反射到月球上产生的，当月相为新月或满月的时候，“灰光”与月面呈现出的月牙形式似乎在相互辉映。

这就是目前所掌握的这颗地球卫星的情况。大炮俱乐部准备从宇宙学、地质学、政治学和伦理学等方面对之进行全面的研究。





第六章　在美国不能不知道的东西和不允许胡乱相信的东西


巴比凯恩的提议使得所有有关月球的天文现象都成为人们的谈资。人人都在潜心研究月球。好像月球是首次出现在地平线上，谁都未曾在天空中见过它似的。各种报纸连篇累牍地再次掀起“狼的太阳”那古老传说的热潮。人们回味着原始时代由于愚昧而赋予月亮这个称呼所产生的影响。简而言之，全美国人都变成了月球迷。

而那些科学杂志则更加专业地探讨了大炮俱乐部所提出的问题。剑桥天文台的那封回信被公布出来，人们做了高度评价，毫无保留地表示了赞同。

在此之前，大多数人都弄不明白人们是如何计算出月球和地球之间的距离的。天文学家们趁此机会告诉他们，这个距离是通过测量月球的视差求得的。如果“视差”一词人们听不懂的话，天文学家们就进一步解释说，那是从地球半径的两端到月球的两条直线构成的角。要是他们怀疑这种方法的精确性的话，就会有人立即向他们证明，不但这个平均距离是二十三万四千三百四十七英里，而且天文学家们计算的误差不会超过七十英里。

对于那些不太了解月球运行规律的人，报纸每天都刊登文章为他们介绍，月球有着两种不同的运动：一种是绕着轴心的自转，另一种是围绕地球的公转。这两种运动都在一个相同的时间段——二十七又三分之一天——里完成。

自转运动也就是在月球表面产生白昼与黑夜的运动。而每个朔望月只有一个白昼和一个黑夜，而且二者的持续时间都是三百五十四又三分之一小时。不过，对于月球来说，幸运的是，它面对地球的那一面被地球那相当于十四个月亮光照强度的光线照亮。至于它那背朝地球的一面，始终没人看见，当然是三百五十四小时都处于绝对的黑夜之中，只是依靠“从其他的星星上散落下来的光亮保持温度而已”。

有一些一根筋的、脑子有点儿冥顽不灵的人，一开始并不明白月球在公转时始终不变地面朝着地球，而实际上它也在自转着。对于这些人，人们便告诉他们：“如果您去餐厅，而且眼睛始终盯着餐桌的中心绕着餐桌转，当您转完了一圈之后，您其实已经自己绕着自己转了一圈，因为您的目光相继扫视了一遍餐桌的各个点。喏，我们不妨把餐厅视作天空，餐桌就是地球，而月球就是您自身！”经这么一比喻，他们就明白了，于是就高高兴兴地离开了。

因此，月球总是只有一个面对着地球。但是，为了准确起见，必须补充一点：由于月球由北向南、由西向东的某种“摆动”的缘故，人们可以看到的月面比它的实际月面的一半还要大一点儿，也就是能看到百分之五十七的月面。

当那些无知的人对月球的自转了解得与剑桥天文台台长一样多的时候，他们就开始非常担心月球绕着地球公转的情况，因此，二十家科学杂志便立即向他们介绍这是怎么一回事。它们向人们指出：挂着满天星斗的天穹可以被视作一个巨大的钟面，月球便在上面运行着，向地球上的居民们指示着准确的时间；月球正是在运行过程中呈现各种月相的。当它背向太阳时，也就是说，当三个星体连成一线，而地球夹在中间的时候，月球呈满月状；当月球与太阳合在一起时，也就是说当它位于地球和太阳之间时，月球呈新月状；最后，当月球与太阳和地球构成一个直角而它又居于直角顶端时，呈现的就是上弦月或下弦月。

至于月球所能达到的天际高度问题，剑桥天文台的回信中已经详细回答了。人人皆知，这一天际高度是随着观测点纬度的变化而变化的。但是，月球通过天顶最高点，也就是说，它直接位于观测者头顶上方的唯一的地区，必须是在南北纬的28°和地球赤道之间。因此，回信中强调指出，试验必须是在地球这一地区的任意一个点进行，这样炮弹才能垂直发射，从而尽快地摆脱地心引力。这是保证试验成功的一个重要条件，而公众对此也极其关注。

至于月球围绕地球公转的轨迹问题，剑桥天文台已经解释得十分清楚：这个轨迹是一条凹曲线，不是圆形而是椭圆形，地球位于某一个圆心上。所有的行星或卫星，它们的轨迹都是这种形状，而且理论力学也证实了它们的轨迹不会出现其他形状。当然，月球在远地点时距离地球最远，而在近地点时距离地球最近。

任何一个美国人不管愿意与否，都得了解这一点，任何人都不可以不懂得。然而，虽然说这些科学原理很快地普及开来，但也必然会出现很多的谬误，会出现一些毫无道理的担忧，而且很难消弭。

例如，有一些正直的人坚称，月球曾是一颗古老的彗星，它在沿着扁长的轨道绕着太阳转，恰好经过地球附近时，被地球的引力圈吸引住。这些坐而论道的天文学家声称，这样就可以解释月球表面的焦黑状况了，认为这是光亮的月球无法弥补的不幸。只不过，当人们向他们指出彗星上有空气，而月球上则空气稀薄或者根本没有空气时，他们便瞠目结舌，无言以对了。

另有一些好像很胆怯的人，他们对月球感到有些害怕。他们听说自从哈里发[24]时代所进行的观测以来，月球的公转在按照一定的比例加速。他们由此而进行了推断，倒也十分符合逻辑：运行速度的加快必然导致两个星球之间的距离缩小；而且，如果这种双重作用没完没了地继续下去的话，月球总有一天会掉落到地球上。不过，当人们告诉他们，根据法国的一位名叫拉普拉斯的著名数学家的计算，这种运行的加速只局限在极其有限的范围之内，而且会出现一定比例的减速，因此，太阳系的平衡在未来的几个世纪中是不会被打破的。这么一来，他们也就放下心来，不再为子孙后代担忧了。

最后，只剩下那些愚昧而迷信的人了。这些人倒也不是完全无知，他们对并不存在的事物倒甚为了解；对于月亮，他们知道得就更多了。他们中的一些人把月亮视作一面光滑的镜子，通过它，人们可以看见地球的各个不同的地方，并相互交流沟通。另有一些人则声称，在观察过的一千次新月中，有九百五十次导致了重大的变故，诸如大灾大难、革命、地震、洪水等。他们因此而认为，这个黑夜星球对人类的命运有着神秘的影响；他们觉得每一个月球人都与某个地球人有感应；他们坚持认为，生命体系完全受它的支配；等等。但是随着时间的推移，这些无稽之谈终究要被抛弃，唯一的真理必须回归。至于美国佬们，他们不再存有其他的野心，只是想要独霸这块天空中的新大陆，在月球的最高峰上插上美利坚合众国的星条旗。





第七章　炮弹赞歌


剑桥天文台在它那封有重大意义的回信中，从天文学的角度阐述清楚了问题，今后需要从力学方面去解决它。

巴比凯恩主席抓紧时间，在大炮俱乐部内任命了一个执行委员会。该委员会的职责是要把大炮、炮弹和火药这三大问题解决好。委员会由下面四位在这三个方面知识渊博的会员组成：巴比凯恩（他在意见分歧的情况下有最终决定权）、摩根将军、埃尔菲斯通少校和J.T.马斯顿——他被委任为委员会的秘书兼发言人。十月八日，执行委员会在共和国街三号巴比凯恩主席家里开会。巴比凯恩首先发言。

“先生们，”他说道，“我们现在必须解决关于弹道学的最重要的问题中的一个。也许，这第一次会议用来讨论大炮的问题更符合逻辑。不过，经过审慎的考虑，我觉得炮弹的问题要比大炮的问题更加重要，而且大炮的体积将取决于炮弹的大小。”

“我来说几句。”J.T.马斯顿大声说道。马斯顿的要求得到了满足。“先生们，”他激动得声音发颤地说道，“我们的主席把炮弹问题摆在其他各种问题之前是颇有见地的！我们即将发射到月球上去的这颗炮弹是我们的信使，是我们的使节，请允许我以一种纯伦理的观点来看待它。先生们，我认为炮弹是人类力量最辉煌的体现。如果说上帝创造了恒星和行星，那么我们人类却创造了炮弹。电的速度、光的速度、恒星的速度、彗星的速度、行星的速度、风的速度以及声音的速度等，都是属于上帝的。然而，比火车的速度和最快的马的速度快一百倍的炮弹的速度却是属于我们人类的！如果我们以每秒七英里的速度把它发射出去，那会是个什么景况呀！难道不是吗，先生们——难道炮弹在月球上不会像一位地球使节似的受到热情的接待吗？”

他控制住了情绪，坐了下来，将注意力集中在面前的一大碟三明治上。

“好了，”巴比凯恩说道，“我们对此已经唱颂了不少赞歌了，现在，我们还是直接进入关键问题吧。”

“我们准备好讨论具体问题了。”委员会的成员们回答道，每个人的嘴里都塞满了三明治。

“你们都知道要解决的问题是什么，”巴比凯恩又说道，“那就是让炮弹的速度达到每秒一万二千码。让我们先研究一下到目前为止，炮弹所能达到的速度是多少。摩根将军可以向我们介绍一下这方面的情况。”

“这并不难，”将军回答道，“因为战争期间，我是试验委员会的成员。我告诉你们吧，射程为两千五百托瓦兹的一百磅的达尔格伦大炮可让炮弹的初速度达到每秒五百码。罗德曼的哥伦比亚大炮试射了一颗重半吨的炮弹，射程为六英里，速度为每秒八百码——这是英国的阿姆斯特朗大炮和帕利泽大炮从来没有达到过的速度。”

“这么说，”巴比凯恩又问道，“这个八百码的速度是迄今为止炮弹发射所能达到的最大速度了？”

“是的。”将军回答。

“啊！”J.T.马斯顿叹息道，“如果我的那门迫击炮没有爆炸的话——”

“是呀，”巴比凯恩平静地回答道，“可它毕竟爆炸了。咱们就以这八百码的速度作为基点吧。必须将这一速度提高二十倍。因此，我们先将达到这一速度的问题留待下一次的会议来讨论吧。现在我请大家把注意力集中在炮弹应该多大才合适的问题上。你们很清楚，我们在这儿要考虑的不再是重达半吨的炮弹了！”

“为什么不是？”少校问道。

“因为我们的这颗炮弹，”J.T.马斯顿迅速回答道，“应该很大，大到足够吸引月球居民的注意，如果月球上真的有人的话。”

“对，”巴比凯恩回答道，“而且还有一个更加重要的原因。”

“您是什么意思？”少校问道。

“我的意思是说，不但要把炮弹发射出去，而且还要注视着它，必须追踪它的飞行全过程，直到它抵达目的地为止。”

“天哪！”将军和少校吃惊地喊道。

“非如此不可，”巴比凯恩镇定自若地说道，“非如此不可，否则我们的试验将不会有任何结果。”

“这么说，”少校反驳道，“您想让这颗炮弹体积巨大？”

“不。请仔细听我说。你们知道，光学仪器已经达到很精密的程度了；有些天文望远镜已经能够达到六千倍了，能够将月球的距离缩短到将近四十英里。而在这一距离下，六十英尺见方的物体完全清晰可辨。人们之所以没有更进一步地增强天文望远镜的穿透力，是因为那样会损害望远镜的光亮度；而月亮只是一面反射镜，不能反射出足够强的光来，使我们能够感知较小的物体。”

“那么，您打算怎么办呢？”将军问道，“您想让您的炮弹直径达到六十英尺？”

“不。”

“那您是想让月光更亮一些？”

“的确如此。如果我能够减少月光穿过的大气层的厚度，不就能让月光变得更亮了吗？要想做到这些，我必须在某座较高的山上设立一架天文望远镜。这就是我们要做的。”

“我明白了，”少校说道，“您的方法让事情变得简单了！那么您希望把放大倍率增加到多少呢？”

“增加到四万八千倍，这样就可以将月球和地球的距离缩小到只有五英里了，而且物体直径只需要九英尺就清晰可见了。”

“妙极了！”J.T.马斯顿嚷道，“我们的炮弹直径就只要九英尺就行了？”

“不过，我冒昧地说一句，”埃尔菲斯通少校打断道，“这么个重量还是——”

“哦！我亲爱的少校，”巴比凯恩回答道，“在讨论它的重量之前，请允许我告诉您，我们的前辈在这一方面是做出过出色成绩的。我并不是想说弹道学没有进步，只是我们应该知道，自中世纪时起，人们就获得了一些惊人的成绩，而且我敢说，比我们所取得的成绩还要惊人。比如，一四五三年，穆罕默德二世围攻君士坦丁堡时，士兵们发射出的石弹重达一千九百磅，个头儿应该挺大的。在骑士时代，在马耳他，圣艾尔玛堡的一尊大炮发射的一些炮弹重达两千五百磅。这之后，我们又见到了什么呢？见到了阿姆斯特朗大炮发射出五百磅的炮弹，见到了罗德曼的哥伦比亚大炮发射出半吨重的炮弹！因此，似乎炮弹的射程加大了，但是它的重量却减轻了。不过，如果我们把注意力集中在这个方面的话，随着科学的进步，我们就能够把穆罕默德二世和马耳他骑士们的炮弹的重量增大十倍。”

“这一点是很明显的，”少校回答道，“但是，您打算用什么金属材料来制造这种炮弹呢？”

“就用铸铁吧。”摩根将军说。

“但是！”少校说，“既然炮弹的重量与它的体积成正比，那么一颗直径为九英尺的铸铁弹的重量就大得吓人了！”

“如果它是实心的，那当然如此；但如果是空心的，那就不一样了。”

“空心的！那还是炮弹吗？”

“是的，是空心炮弹，”巴比凯恩回答道，“它必须是一颗空心炮弹，一颗一百零八英寸的实心炮弹可能重达二十多万磅，显然太重了。不过，为了让炮弹保持一定的稳定性，我建议它的重量为五千磅。”

“那它的弹壳应该多厚？”少校问道。

“如果我们按照规定的比例做的话，”摩根回答道，“一颗一百零八英寸直径的炮弹的弹壳至少得两英尺厚。”

“那可太厚了，”巴比凯恩说，“请注意：这里所说的炮弹并不是穿甲弹，只要让它足以抵御火药气体的压力就可以了。因此，现在的问题就是，要做一颗重量仅两万磅的铸铁炮弹，弹壁应该多厚？我们聪明的秘书将当场告诉我们。”

“这再简单不过了。”令人尊敬的委员会秘书回答道。他边说边飞快地在纸上写了几道几何公式，大家看到在他的笔下出现了几个π和x的二次幂。他甚至好像没怎么计算就求出了某个立方根，然后说道：“弹壁顶多两英寸厚。”

“这么点儿厚度行吗？”少校满脸疑惑地问道。

“显然不行！”巴比凯恩主席回答道。

“那该怎么办呢？”埃尔菲斯通不知如何是好地问道。

“不要用铸铁，改用另外一种金属。”

“用铜怎么样？”摩根说。

“不行，铜仍然太重，我有更好的建议。”

“什么金属？”少校问道。

“铝。”巴比凯恩回答道。

“铝！”主席的那三位同事异口同声地喊道。

“正是，我的朋友们。这种宝贵的金属白如银，又如金子般具有恒定性，如铁一般具有韧性，如铜一般具有可熔性，又如玻璃一般轻巧，而且还很容易加工；它在大自然中分布很广，因为铝矾土是大多数岩石的主要成分；它的重量只是铁的四分之一。它似乎是专门为我们提供的制造炮弹的特殊材料。”

“不过，亲爱的主席，”少校问道，“铝的成本是不是非常之高呀？”

“从前是的，在发现它的初期，确实昂贵；但是现在，一磅铝只要九美元。”

“可是，九美元一磅也还是价格不菲呀！”不轻易屈服的少校反驳道。

“那倒是，亲爱的少校，但这个价格并不是不可以接受的。”

“那么我们的炮弹的重量会是多少呢？”摩根问道。

“我算了一下，结果是，”巴比凯恩回答道，“一颗直径为一百零八英寸的炮弹，如果是铸铁制的，重量会是六万七千四百四十磅；而用铝浇铸的话，重量就会减小到一万九千二百五十磅。”

“妙极了！妙极了！”少校喊道，“不过，您要知道，一磅铝价格为九美元的话，那我们的炮弹就得花费——”

“十七万三千两百五十美元，这我知道得很清楚。但是，朋友们，你们不必担心，我敢保证我们的试验并不缺钱。喏，你们大家对使用铝怎么看呀？”

“同意！”委员会的那三位委员异口同声地回答。委员会的第一次会议到此便结束了，炮弹的问题已经完全解决了。





第八章　大炮的历史


这次会议所做出的决定在外界引起了极大的反响。一些胆小的人一想到要将一颗重达两万磅的炮弹发往太空，不免有点儿惶恐不安。有的人在寻思什么样的大炮能够具有如此大的威力，让这么大个儿的炮弹产生足够大的初速度。委员会第二次会议记录将很好地回答种种疑问。

“亲爱的同事们，”巴比凯恩说道，“我们现在就来讨论一下大炮制造的问题。它需要多长，什么结构，重量是多少等。我们有可能得造一门巨型炮，但是，无论困难有多大，我们的工业精英们都会战而胜之的。请大家注意听我说，如有反对意见，请立即提出来。我不害怕反对意见！现在的问题是这样的：如何让一颗直径为一百零八英寸、重达两万磅的炮弹产生每秒一万两千码的初速度？当一颗炮弹被发射到空中去，会是个什么情况呢？它会为三种独立的力量所左右：外界阻力、地球引力和驱使它的推动力。让我们来研究一下这三种力量。外界阻力，也就是空气阻力，影响并不大。其实，地球大气层的厚度只有四十英里。而炮弹的速度高达每秒一万两千码，五秒钟就穿过去了，时间很短，以至外界阻力可以说是微乎其微的。再来看一下地球引力，也就是炮弹的重力问题。我们知道，这个重力是与距离的平方成反比的。当一个物体呈自由落体状坠落到地球表面的时候，它在第一秒钟时下降十五英尺；而这同样的物体被移到二十五万七千五百四十二英里的远处，也就是说，移到月球所在的那么远的地方去的话，它的下降幅度在第一秒钟时将减小到半法分[25]左右。这几乎等于静止不动了。因此，我们需要逐渐克服重力作用。怎么才能如愿以偿呢？利用推动力。”

“这就是困难之所在。”少校紧接着说道。

“没错，这确实是困难之所在，”巴比凯恩继续说道，“但是，我们一定会战胜它的，因为这个对我们来说必不可少的推动力将由大炮的长度以及所使用的炮弹火药的多少来决定，而后者又是受到前者的抗力限制的。因此，我们今天就要研究一下大炮体积的大小问题。”

“到目前为止，”巴比凯恩接着说道，“最长的那些大炮，并没有超过二十五英尺，而我们将不得不制造的体积巨大的大炮，会让世人惊讶不已。很明显，必须拥有一门炮身很长的大炮，因为炮身越长，炮弹底下聚集的气体就越多；但是也得有一定的限度，超过了也没有必要。”

“太对了。”少校说道，“在这种情况下，应该采用一些什么样的标准呢？”

“一般来说，一门大炮的长度是炮弹直径的二十到二十五倍，重量是炮弹的两百三十五到两百四十倍。”

“这可不够。”J.T.马斯顿急躁地大声嚷嚷道。

“我同意，是不够，尊敬的朋友。确实，按照这个比例，发射一颗直径九英尺、重三万磅的炮弹所需的大炮只不过长两百二十五英尺，重七百二十万磅。”

“这也太小了，简直就像一把手枪！”J.T.马斯顿说。

“我也这么认为，”巴比凯恩回应道，“因此我想把它的长度扩大到四倍，造一门长九百英尺的大炮。”

将军和少校提出了点异议；但是，巴比凯恩的这一建议得到了大炮俱乐部秘书的热烈支持，最后被采纳了。

“但是，”埃尔菲斯通说，“炮管壁的厚度应该是多少呢？”

“六英尺厚。”巴比凯恩回答道。

“您大概不会认为得把这么个大玩意儿支到炮架上去吧？”少校问道。

“可是，那才壮观呀！”J.T.马斯顿说。

“不过，不好操作，”巴比凯恩说道，“我想还是把这门大炮就浇铸在地上，用一圈一圈的铸铁把它箍紧，再用石头和石灰给它砌上厚厚的炮座。炮身一旦铸成，就要仔细地铰好炮膛[26]，量好内径，以防止炮弹漏气[27]，这样就不会浪费任何一点气体，火药爆炸产生的力都将变成推动力。”

“我有一个小小的疑问，”埃尔菲斯通说，“这门加农炮—榴弹炮—迫击炮混合体有没有膛线呀？”

“没有，当然没有。”巴比凯恩回答道，“我们必须让它具有一个非常大的初速度；你们很清楚，有膛线的炮管发射的炮弹没有光滑炮管发射的速度快。”

“没错。”

委员会的四名成员每人都吃了三明治，又喝了茶，然后又开始讨论起来。

“先生们，”巴比凯恩说道，“我们现在必须考虑一下使用哪种金属。我们的大炮必须具有抗断裂性极大，硬度高，高温耐熔，遇酸不溶解、不氧化的特性。”

“这些都不成问题，”少校回答道，“而且，因为必须使用大量的金属材料，选择起来还不能盲目。”

“那好！”摩根说道，“我建议用迄今为止已知的最好的合金，也就是说，由一百份铜、十二份锡和六份黄铜组成的合金。”

“我承认，”主席说道，“这种组合结果非常好，但是，照目前的情况来说，它的造价太昂贵，制造起来也极其繁难。因此，我想，必须采用一种性能极好却价格低廉的材料，比如铸铁。您是不是这个想法，少校？”

“正是。”埃尔菲斯通回答道。

“确实，”巴比凯恩接着说道，“铸铁的造价只有铜的十分之一，而且它很容易熔化，在砂模里简单地浇铸即可，操作起来极其快捷，因此，既省钱又省时。另外，这种材质绝佳。我记得战争期间，在围攻亚特兰大的时候，那些铸铁大炮每门炮每隔二十分钟便发射一次，共射出一千颗炮弹，而大炮却毫发无损。”

“可是铸铁很容易断裂。”摩根说道。

“那倒是，不过，它有极强的抗力。因此，我要请我们尊敬的秘书计算一下，一门长九百英尺、内径九英尺、炮筒壁厚六英尺的铸铁大炮有多重。”

“马上就能算出来。”J.T.马斯顿回答说。然后，他非常熟练地列出公式来，一分钟之后，他说道：

“这门大炮将重达六万八千零四十吨。如果按每磅两美分来计算，得——”

“两百五十一万七百零一美元。”

J. T.马斯顿、少校和将军神情焦虑地看着巴比凯恩。

“好！先生们，”主席说道，“我要把我昨天跟你们说的重复一遍，请你们放宽心，我们并不缺钱！”

主席做了如此保证之后，委员会的成员们又决定在第二天晚上举行第三次会议，然后便散会了。





第九章　火药问题


接下来需要解决的便是火药问题。公众都在焦急地等待着这最后一个问题的解决。炮弹的大小和大炮的长度都已经定下来了，那么制造推动力所必需的火药应该是多少呢？

一般来说，大家都认为火药是十四世纪时由德国修道士施瓦兹[28]发明的，他甚至为这一伟大的发明付出了生命的代价。但是现在几乎已经证实，这一说法应该归入中世纪的传说中了。火药并不是哪一个人发明的，它是直接从希腊火硝衍生而来的；它同希腊火硝一样，都是由硫黄和硝石构成的。很少有人了解火药在力学方面的威力。而必须了解这点，才能明白委员会所讨论的这一问题有多么重要。

一升火药重约两磅，燃烧时会产生四百升气体；这些气体释放出来，在高达两千四百度的高温作用下膨胀开来，充盈着四千升的空间。因此，火药的体积与它爆炸时产生的气体体积之比是一比四千。我们由此可以想象，当这些气体被压缩在四千分之一的一个狭小空间里的时候，它们产生的推动力该是多么吓人。第二天，当委员会的成员们进行讨论时，他们对此已经有足够的了解了。

埃尔菲斯通少校首先发言，因为他在战争期间曾经担任过火药厂厂长。

“先生们，”这位著名的化学家说道，“我想先举出一些无可辩驳的数字作为我们讨论的基础。旧式的二十四磅炮弹仅用十六磅火药就能发射出去。”

“您对这个数据有把握吗？”巴比凯恩问道。

“绝对没错，”少校回答道，“阿姆斯特朗大炮只用七十五磅的火药便能发射一颗八百磅的炮弹，而罗德曼的哥伦比亚大炮只用一百六十磅的火药，就能将半吨重的炮弹射到六英里远的地方。这些都是事实，毋庸置疑，因为这些数据都是我亲自从大炮委员会的会议纪要中摘录的。”

“好极了。”将军说道。

“那好！”少校接着说道，“从这些数据中要得出的结论就是，火药的用量并不随着炮弹重量的增加而增加。确实，发射一颗二十四磅的炮弹需用十六磅的火药；换句话说，对普通大炮而言，火药的用量是炮弹重量的三分之二，但这一比例并不是恒定的。你们计算一下就会发现，一颗半吨重的炮弹需用的火药并不是三百三十三磅，而是一百六十磅。”

“您的意思是？”主席问道。

“亲爱的少校，”J.T.马斯顿说道，“如果您将您的理论推向极端的话，您会发现，当炮弹足够重时，您就不需要放任何火药了。”

“我的朋友马斯顿即使是讨论严肃的问题，也这么乱开玩笑，”少校回敬道，“不过，敬请放心，我马上就提出一些有关火药的数据，完全能满足他那作为炮手的自尊心。我只根据统计事实说，战争期间，即使是最大的大炮，它的火药的用量也被减少了，经过试验，减少到了炮弹重量的十分之一。”

“非常精确，”摩根说，“不过，在决定推动力所必需的火药数量之前，我觉得——”

“我们将使用粗粒火药，”少校说道，“它比粉状火药能更快地引起爆炸。”

“那是肯定的，”摩根说道，“但是，它极具破坏性，会损伤炮膛的。”

“是的！对于一门旨在长期使用的大炮来说，这确实是一大缺陷，可是对于我们的哥伦比亚大炮来说，就无伤大雅了。我们不会有任何被炸飞的危险，为了使它的推动力发挥到极致，需要迅速点燃火药。”

“我们可以，”J.T.马斯顿说道，“在炮弹上打几个孔，以便同时在多处点火。”

“当然，”埃尔菲斯通回答道，“不过，这样操作起来更加困难。因此，我再回到我说的那种粗粒火药上，它能解决这些难题。罗德曼在给他的哥伦比亚大炮填充火药时，使用的是一种如栗子一般大的粗粒火药，它是用在铸铁锅炉里简单烘烤的柳木炭制成的。这种火药既坚硬又有光泽，摸了手上也没有印迹，并且富含氢气和氧气，一点就着；尽管容易爆裂，但却对炮口没有什么损伤。”

在这之前，巴比凯恩一直没有参加到讨论中来。他让大家说，自己只是在听。很明显，他已经有了一个主意，但他只是简简单单地说道：“现在，朋友们，你们的意见是用多少火药呢？”

大炮俱乐部的那三名成员彼此看了一会儿。

“二十万磅。”摩根最终开口说道。

“五十万磅。”少校补充道。

“八十万磅！”J.T.马斯顿大声嚷道。

在这三位同事提出各自的建议之后，大家沉默了一会儿。最后，巴比凯恩主席打破了沉默。

“先生们，”他语气平缓地说道，“我考虑这一问题的原则是，我们在一些既定条件下制造的这门大炮的后坐力巨大。因此，我说的话要让尊敬的J.T.马斯顿感到惊讶了：我想告诉他，他的计算太保守了，而我建议把他提出的八十万磅火药的数字翻一番。”

“一百六十万磅？”J.T.马斯顿闻言，腾地从椅子上站了起来，说道。

“正是。”

“可是，那就得使用我那半英里长的大炮了。显而易见，一百六十万磅的火药将要占据一个将近两万二千立方英尺的空间；可是，您的大炮的容量只有五万四千立方英尺，一半都给火药填满了，而炮管又不够长，无法让气体膨胀到产生足够的推动力去推出炮弹。”

“不过，”主席说道，“我坚持认为需要这一数量的火药。你们仔细想一想，一百六十万磅的火药将产生六十亿升气体。六十亿升呀！你们想想看呀！”

“那要怎么做呢？”将军问道。

“这很简单。必须把这么多火药的用量减少，同时还得保证这个推动力。”

“对！可是，用什么方法呢？”

“我来说给你们听吧。”巴比凯恩平静地回答道。

“这再容易不过了，把这么一大堆火药的体积缩减到原来的四分之一大就行了。你们都知道构成蔬菜基本组织的那种奇妙的物质吧？这种物质，可以从各种物体，尤其是棉花中获得，而且非常纯净。其实棉花只是棉籽上的绒毛而已。而棉花浸泡在冷硝酸中，就会转化成一种极难溶化，而又极易燃烧、极易爆炸的物质。一八三二年，一位名叫布拉科诺的法国化学家首次发现了这种物质，把它称为‘木炸药’。一八三八年，另一位法国人佩鲁兹研究了它的各种特性。最后，一八四六年，巴勒[29]的化学教授松班建议将它用于战争。这种炸药，就是棉火药或者叫硝化棉。这种物质很容易制成：把棉花浸入硝酸里十五分钟，然后用水冲洗，再晒干，就行了。”

“这的确非常简单。”摩根说道。

“再者，硝化棉耐潮，我们认为这一特质非常宝贵，因为给大炮装填火药得花费好几天工夫。它的燃点不是两百四十度，而是一百七十度；而且，它的燃烧速度极快，可以先点燃普通火药，然后再引燃它。”

“好极了！”少校说。

“只是它贵了点儿。”

“那有什么关系？”J.T.马斯顿反驳道。

“最后一点，它可以给炮弹以四倍于普通火药所给予的速度。我还要补充一句，如果在其中掺进它的重量的十分之八的、加了硝酸盐的碳酸盐的话，它爆炸产生的力还会大幅度地增大。”

“这有必要吗？”少校问道。

“我认为没有必要，”巴比凯恩回答道，“因此，我们用不着一百六十万磅火药，只需四十万磅硝化棉就行了；而且因为我们可以毫无危险地把五百磅的棉花压缩成二十七立方英尺，所以这种物质在哥伦比亚大炮里只占据着一个三十托瓦兹高的空间。这么一来，炮弹在飞往月球之前，在六十亿升气体的推动下，还要在炮膛里穿越七百多英尺的距离！”

听到这里，J.T.马斯顿激动得难以自抑了，他像一颗炮弹似的猛扑进他的朋友巴比凯恩的怀里；如果不是巴比凯恩身板硬朗，扛得住“炮弹”的冲击的话，可能就会被马斯顿顶穿了。

委员会的第三次会议在这一小插曲下结束了。

巴比凯恩和他的那几位无所畏惧的同事刚刚解决了炮弹、大炮和火药等极其复杂的问题。他们的计划已经拟定，就等着实施了。

“小事一桩，小菜一碟。”J.T.马斯顿说道。





第十章　两千五百万个朋友与一个敌人


美国公众对大炮俱乐部的事情，无论大小，都表现出浓厚的兴趣。他们每天都在关注委员会的讨论。这次伟大试验的最简单的准备工作、它涉及的几个数字、尚待解决的力学难题——总之，有关“它的进展”的一切情况——都是他们最感兴趣的。

这时候，一个意外情况更加激发了公众对这次纯科学的试验的兴趣。

大家都知道，巴比凯恩的计划使它的制订者赢得了很多的崇拜者和朋友。然而，有这么一个人，美利坚合众国各州中唯一的这么一个人，却起来反对大炮俱乐部的这种做法。他一有机会便对它进行猛烈的攻击。人的本性使得巴比凯恩对这唯一的一个人的反对意见比对所有其他人的赞扬声更加关注。其实，他很清楚这个反对意见的动机，知道这个唯一的敌对意见源自何方，知道它是出于个人恩怨且积怨甚深，他还知道它是从何种争强好胜的心态中萌发的。

这个死缠着不放的敌人，大炮俱乐部主席从未与他谋过面。这反倒更好，否则狭路相逢，后果不堪设想。这个对手同巴比凯恩一样，也是一位科学家，生性狂妄自大、桀骜不驯，性格暴烈，是个十足的美国佬。人们称他尼科尔船长。他住在费城。

人人皆知南北战争期间炮弹和铁甲之间的奇特的争斗：炮弹旨在穿透铁甲，而铁甲则下定决心不让炮弹穿透。从此，南北各州的海军就彻底地改变了。炮弹和铁甲在前所未有的激烈争斗中互不相让：炮弹变大变重，铁甲也在不断地加宽加厚。“梅里马克”号、“莫尼托”号、“田纳西”号、“威霍肯”号[30]在披上铁甲以防敌方炮火的攻击之后，也发射了一些巨型炮弹。事实上，它们在用它们不希望对方用以对付它们的方法来对付对方，而战争艺术就是建立在这个不朽法则上的。

不过，如果说巴比凯恩是一位伟大的炮弹铸造者的话，那么尼科尔就是一位伟大的铁甲锻造者。一个夜以继日地在巴尔的摩铸造炮弹，而另一个则夜以继日地在费城锻造铁甲。巴比凯恩刚设计出一种新型炮弹，尼科尔便立刻发明一种新的铁甲。二人遵循着各自完全对立的观点在行事。大炮俱乐部主席毕生从事“穿洞”，而尼科尔船长则在竭力地阻止对方把他的铁甲打穿。幸好，这两位对国家极其有用的公民被五六十英里的一段距离隔了开来，这使得他俩永远无法相遇。现在，这两位发明家到底谁能胜过谁，人们尚不太清楚，因为双方都成绩不菲，难以定论。不过，说到底，似乎铁甲最终会败给炮弹。然而，资深人士仍心存疑虑。

最近的一次试验，巴比凯恩的锥形炮弹面对尼科尔的铁甲简直是小巫见大巫了。那一天，费城的这位铁甲锻造者自以为胜券在握，就不把自己的对手放在眼里了。但是，当巴比凯恩用普通的六百磅炮弹代替前面的那些锥形炮弹，以非常适中的速度发射之后，尼科尔船长便败下阵来了。的确，这些炮弹虽然速度一般[31]，却能将用最好的金属锻造的铁甲击破、击穿，炸成碎片。

竞争发展到这一地步，胜利似乎应属于炮弹了，但是，在战争结束的当天，尼科尔却发明了一种新型铸钢铁甲！这是铁甲中的一个杰作，它在向世界上所有的炮弹挑战。尼科尔船长把它运往华盛顿的炮兵靶场，挑衅大炮俱乐部主席前来比试比试。但是，巴比凯恩已经宣布了和平，不想去一比高下。

于是，尼科尔火冒三丈，他扬言可以接受任何形状的炮弹，无论是实心的、空心的、圆形的还是锥形的，都不妨一试。可是，巴比凯恩不为所动，不愿比试，怕影响自己向月球发射炮弹计划的成功。

尼科尔见对方如此执拗，非常气愤，便心生一计，他向巴比凯恩提出各种好处，以引诱他比赛。他提出把自己的铁甲放在离大炮两百码处。巴比凯恩仍然表示拒绝。那么，一百码如何？即使是七十五码也不参赛。

“那就五十码吧，”尼科尔船长通过报纸叫板，“再近些也行，二十五码，而且，我就站在铁甲后面！”

巴比凯恩回复说，即使尼科尔船长站在铁甲前面，他也不会开炮的。

尼科尔得知对方这一回复，再也克制不住了，含沙射影地说对方在尽量掩饰自己的懦弱、胆怯；说对方完全是被吓破了胆才一再拒绝的；说那些炮手现在小心翼翼地躲在六英里以外打仗，是用数学公式来代替个人胆量的。

对于尼科尔的这种种影射，巴比凯恩并没予以还击。他也许根本就没有听到对方的那些讽刺挖苦，因为当时他正在一门心思地计划他那伟大的创举呢。

当巴比凯恩在大炮俱乐部做了他的那个著名的报告后，尼科尔船长已经是怒发冲冠，心情难以平复了。这其中还夹杂着一种极大的嫉妒和一种强烈的无力感！如何才能制造出一种比那九百英尺长的哥伦比亚大炮更好的东西呢？什么样的铁甲能够永远抵御一颗两万磅重的炮弹！一开始，尼科尔被这“轰天炮”吓住了，沮丧而无奈，但他随后便逐渐恢复镇静，决心粉碎对方所说的炮弹重量的提议。

于是，他对大炮俱乐部的计划进行了猛烈的攻击，他写了许多信件，报纸倒也不拒绝为他发表。他努力证明巴比凯恩对重炮射击的基本原理一无所知。根据尼科尔的计算，让某一个物体产生每秒一万两千码的速度是绝对不可能的。他认为一发如此重的炮弹不可能穿透地球大气层！退一步讲，即使达到了这一速度，炮弹也抵御不了一百六十万磅火药燃烧后释放出来的气体的压力；而就算它抵御住了这个压力，那它至少也忍受不了这样高的温度。它一射出哥伦比亚大炮的炮口就会熔化，像雨点一般纷纷溅落，浇到那些冒冒失失的观看者的脑袋上。

面对这些攻击，巴比凯恩连眉头都没皱一皱，仍然继续工作着。

于是，尼科尔从其他方面对这个问题发起攻击。他认为，且莫说这一试验从各个方面来看都毫无意义，而且，它无论对将去参观这个该受谴责的试验的观众们，还是对处在这门该死的大炮周边的各个城市，都是极具危险性的。另外，他还指出，如果炮弹到达不了目的地——它绝对不可能到达目的地的——那它显然会落在地球上；而这么个大家伙，以它速度的平方加速坠落，必然会导致地球上的某个地方惨遭祸殃。因此，在此种情况之下，即使没有伤害到自由公民们的权利，政府也应该出面干涉，而不应为了某一个人的一时消遣而危及大众的安全。

大家可以看到，尼科尔船长都夸大其词到了什么程度。但是，持有他这种观点的只有他一人。没有人相信他的不祥的预言。他未能从大炮俱乐部主席那儿夺走哪怕一个崇拜者，而后者甚至都不屑于反驳他的对手的那些观点。

尼科尔走投无路了，他把自己的全部精力都搭了进去，但仍然未能赢得胜利，所以便决定用钱取胜。于是，他在《里士满调查报》上就此问题公开提出一系列的赌注，而且越赌越大。

他打赌道：

1.大炮俱乐部无法筹集到必需的资金，赌注一千美元。

2.铸造一门九百英尺长的大炮不切实际，而且不可能成功，赌注两千美元。

3.给哥伦比亚大炮装填火药是不可能的，硝化棉在炮弹的压力之下会自燃，赌注三千美元。

4.一开炮，哥伦比亚大炮就会爆炸，赌注四千美元。

5.炮弹飞不出六英里，而且在发射几秒钟之后便会落地，赌注五千美元。

尼科尔船长因此为他那无法遏制的执拗下了巨额赌注，总计不少于一万五千美元。

尽管赌注巨大，但五月[32]十九日，他还是收到了一封封了口的短笺，内容十分简单，就两个字：

愿赌。

巴比凯恩

十月十八日于巴尔的摩





第十一章　佛罗里达州和得克萨斯州


不过，有一个问题尚需解决：必须选择一个适合试验的地方。根据剑桥天文台的建议，炮弹应垂直于地平线发射，也就是说，应正对天顶。而月球只有在纬度0°到28°之间才会到达天空最高点，换句话说，它的赤纬只有28°。因此，必须精确无误地确定巨型哥伦比亚大炮的铸造地点。

十月二十日，大炮俱乐部召开全体会议，巴比凯恩带来一张绘制精美的美国地图。“先生们，”他在讨论前说道，“我想我们都同意试验只能而且只应该在美利坚合众国的土地上进行。幸运的是，美国的某些边界已延伸到北纬28°以南了。你们仔细看一下这张地图就会发现，我们拥有得克萨斯州和佛罗里达州的整个南部地区。”

会议做出决定，哥伦比亚大炮要么在得克萨斯州要么在佛罗里达州铸造。不过，这一决定可能会引发这两个州的不同城镇之间史无前例的竞争。

北纬28°线与美国海岸交汇之后，先是横穿佛罗里达半岛，并将之分为差不多大的两部分。随后，它进入墨西哥湾，穿过由亚拉巴马州、密西西比州和路易斯安那州构成的弓形海岸。然后，在得克萨斯州的一角登陆，延伸过墨西哥，穿越索诺拉，跨过古老的加利福尼亚州，隐没于茫茫的太平洋之中。因此，只有得克萨斯州和佛罗里达州两州位于这条纬线以南的那些部分，才符合剑桥天文台所建议的纬度条件。

佛罗里达州南部地区并无什么重要的城市，只有一些大堡垒耸立着，那是防备东流西窜的印第安人的。只有一个城市——坦帕城——可能符合条件，有权申请。

相反，在得克萨斯州，城市更多也更重要：纽埃西斯地区的科珀斯克里斯蒂，以及布拉沃河上的那些城市——威伯地区的拉雷多、科马里特、圣伊格纳西奥，斯塔尔地区的里奥格兰德城，伊达尔戈地区的爱丁堡，卡梅伦地区的圣丽塔、埃尔潘达、布朗斯维尔——组成了一个强势联盟，对抗着咄咄逼人的佛罗里达州。因此，刚一获知会议的决定，得克萨斯州和佛罗里达州的议员们便飞快地赶到了巴尔的摩。自那一时刻起，巴比凯恩主席和大炮俱乐部中有影响的会员们就没日没夜地被一些强烈的要求包围着。如果说希腊的七座城市为争夺荷马诞生地的殊荣而争执不休的话，那么得克萨斯州和佛罗里达州这两个州则为了一门大炮的问题而威胁要以武力相向。

这时候，人们看到那些“凶狠的兄弟”携带着武器在巴尔的摩的大街小巷里游来荡去。每次双方一见面，大家都担心会发生冲突，那样可能会导致灾难性的后果。幸好，由于巴比凯恩主席的谨慎和机智，这种危险才得以避免。个人的那种种不满在各个州的报纸上得到了宣泄。这么一来，《纽约先驱论坛报》和《论坛报》支持得克萨斯州，而《时代报》和《美国评论》则站在佛罗里达州的代表们一边。大炮俱乐部的会员们不知道该听谁的好。

得克萨斯州的二十六个县不可一世地一起上阵；而佛罗里达州则回击道：在一个只有得克萨斯州六分之一大的州里，有十二个县动员起来了，它们的力量足以胜过二十六个县。

得克萨斯州大肆标榜它拥有三十三万人口，而佛罗里达州面积虽小，只有五万六千人，但也不忘吹嘘自己人口密度大。

得克萨斯人通过《纽约先驱论坛报》补充道：“对一个生产全美国最优质棉花的州，一个生产造船用的优质绿橡树的州，一个蕴藏着出矿率高达百分之五十的优质煤矿和铁矿的州，我们应该表达敬意才是。”

对此，《美国评论》回应道，佛罗里达州的土地虽然没那么肥沃，却能为哥伦比亚大炮的制模和铸造提供最好的条件，因为它是由沙土和黏土构成的。

“可能确实不错，”得克萨斯人回敬道，“但是，想在一个地方铸造任何一样东西，就必须先到那个地方去。然而，去佛罗里达州的交通极为不便，而得克萨斯州沿岸却有着加尔维斯顿海湾，周长达十四法里，能停泊全世界的船队。”

“很好，”忠实于佛罗里达州的那些报纸回应道，“你们竟然把你们那位于纬度29°线以南的加尔维斯顿海湾都给抬出来了。难道我们就没有圣埃斯皮里图海湾吗？它可就在纬度28°线上呀，而且船只通过它就可以直达坦帕城了。”

“好美丽的海湾！”得克萨斯州人反诘道，“它的一半都被泥沙淤塞住了！”

“你们才被淤塞住了呢！”佛罗里达州人气愤不已地驳斥道。

口水战如此这般地打了几天，佛罗里达人企图把对手引到另一个战场上去。有一天，《时代报》暗示，由于这个试验“纯粹是美国的”，那它就应该在一块“纯粹是美国的”领土上进行。

闻听此言，得克萨斯人急了，叫喊道：“美国人！难道我们不是同你们一样是美国人吗？得克萨斯州和佛罗里达州不是都在一八四五年并入美利坚合众国的吗？”

“毫无疑问，”《时代报》回答道，“我们可是从一八二〇年起就属于美国了。”

“这我们是相信的，”《论坛报》回击道，“在当了二百年的西班牙人或英国人之后，人家又把你们以五百万美元的价格卖给了美国！”

“那又怎么样！”佛罗里达人反驳道，“我们应该因此而感到羞惭吗？一八〇三年，难道美国不是以一千六百万美元从拿破仑那儿买下了路易斯安那州吗？”

“这是奇耻大辱！”得克萨斯州的代表们吼叫道，“像佛罗里达州这么一丁点儿大的地方也敢同得克萨斯州相提并论？得克萨斯州可没被卖过，而是独立自主的。它于一八三六年三月二日把墨西哥人赶走，在山姆·休斯顿于圣哈辛托河畔击败桑塔·安纳[33]的军队之后，便宣布成立了联合共和国！这个州最后自愿加入了美利坚合众国！”

“没错，那是因为它害怕墨西哥人！”佛罗里达人回答道。

“害怕！”自从这个实在很刺激人的词说出来之后，局势便变得非常严峻了。人们预见到双方的人马会在巴尔的摩的街头巷尾大打出手，非置对方于死地不可，于是不得不把代表们监视起来。

巴比凯恩主席不知如何是好。纪要、文件、恐吓信纷纷落到了他的手里。他应该支持哪一方呢？从土地的适用性、通信的便利性、交通的快捷性来说，这两个州旗鼓相当，不分伯仲。至于政治条件，也都没有问题。

巴比凯恩为此犹豫不决，举棋不定了很长时间，最后他决心摆脱困境。他把他的同事们召集在一起，向他们提出了一个非常明智的解决办法，我们马上就可以看到。

“仔细考虑佛罗里达州和得克萨斯州之间刚发生的事之后，”巴比凯恩说道，“很明显，同样的种种困难也将会出现在被看好的那个州的各个城市之间。竞争将越来越扩大，从州到市，难度也愈发地加大。而得克萨斯州就有十一个城市符合规定的条件，它们都将为争夺这份荣耀而博弈不止，这又将给我们制造出一些新的麻烦来。而佛罗里达州却只有一个城市，因此，我们就选择佛罗里达州，选择坦帕城吧！”

这个决定一公布，得克萨斯州的代表们便惊呆了。他们怒火中烧，愤恨不已，指名道姓地大骂大炮俱乐部的会员们。巴尔的摩的行政官员们只有一个办法，他们便采取了这个办法。他们让人开来一列特许专列，硬是将得克萨斯人塞进车里，以时速三十英里的速度把他们送走了。

然而，尽管把他们全都迅速地送走了，可他们仍然没有忘记冲对手们最后再挖苦一句，威吓一下。

他们挖苦佛罗里达州小得可怜，只不过是两个大海中间夹着的一个狭小的半岛；他们还声称，佛罗里达州肯定承受不住炮弹的冲击，大炮一响，准会被震上天去的。

“好呀！就让它上天去吧！”佛罗里达人以一种古斯巴达时代的简洁语言回应道。





第十二章　世界各地行动起来[34]


天文学、力学、地形学方面的难题一解决，资金的问题就出来了。实施该计划必须筹集一笔巨款。任何个人，甚至任何一个州都拿不出所必需的数百万美元来。

于是，巴比凯恩主席打定主意，尽管这是一项美国人的试验，也要把它当作一项全球的共同事业来做，并要求各个国家给予财政援助。他坚称，参与地球卫星的事业既是全球人的权利也是全球人的义务。为此目的而开展的公开募捐，从巴尔的摩扩展到全世界，全世界都行动起来。

这场募捐运动将会异乎寻常地获得成功。不过，这是赠款而非借贷。严格地说，这一运动是没有任何回报的，是没有任何的获利机会的。

不过，巴比凯恩报告的影响不仅局限于美国国内，它越过了大西洋和太平洋，席卷了亚洲和欧洲、非洲和大洋洲。美利坚合众国的各个天文台同国外的天文台进行直接联系。一些天文台，如巴黎、彼得堡、柏林、斯德哥尔摩、汉堡、马耳他、里斯本、贝拿勒斯、马德拉斯等地的天文台，都纷纷向大炮俱乐部表示祝贺；其他国家的那些天文台则持一种谨慎的观望态度。至于格林尼治天文台，在英国其他二十二个天文台的支持下，态度十分明确地表示反对。它断然否定试验会取得成功，公开站在尼科尔船长一边。这纯粹是英国式的妒意大发。

十月八日，巴比凯恩主席发表了一篇热情洋溢的宣言，号召“全球所有善良的人们”积极地行动起来。这篇宣言被译成各种语言，取得了巨大的成功。

募捐活动在美利坚合众国各主要城市展开，募捐到的钱最后存入了巴尔的摩街九号的巴尔的摩银行里。接着，在欧、美两个大陆的各个国家又开展了募捐活动：

维也纳，S.M.德·罗斯柴尔德银行；

彼得堡，施蒂格列茨公司；

巴黎，动产信贷银行；

斯德哥尔摩，托蒂及阿弗莱德森银行；

伦敦，N.M.罗斯柴尔德父子银行；

都灵，阿尔杜安公司；

柏林，门德尔松银行；

日内瓦，隆巴尔及奥迪埃公司；

君士坦丁堡，奥斯曼银行；

布鲁塞尔，J.兰伯特银行；

马德里，丹尼尔·威思韦尔银行；

阿姆斯特丹，荷兰信贷银行；

罗马，托洛尼亚公司；

里斯本，莱思纳银行；

哥本哈根，私人银行；

里约热内卢，私人银行；

蒙得维的亚，私人银行；

瓦尔帕莱索，托马斯·拉尚贝尔公司；

墨西哥城，马丁·达朗公司；

巴比凯恩主席的宣言发表后第三天，就有四百万美元汇入美利坚合众国各个城市的银行了。有了这么一大笔资金，大炮俱乐部的试验工作就可以开始了。不过，几天之后，美国收到一封又一封电报，说是外国的募捐搞得也很轰轰烈烈。有些国家表现得慷慨大方，也有一些国家却并不豪爽。这也难怪，性格使然。不管怎么说，数字比语言更有说服力，以下便是募捐活动结束之后，大炮俱乐部所统计到的捐款情况。

俄国捐出的款项高达三十六万八千七百三十三卢布。俄国人对科学有着极大的兴趣，在天文学研究方面取得了很大的进步，这多亏了建有许多天文台。如果了解这些情况，就不会对他们的慷慨解囊感到惊讶了。

法国一开始是嘲讽美国人的狂妄自大的。法国人趁机以月亮为题材，改编了成千上万的老旧文字游戏和一二十部滑稽戏，其中庸俗与无知的语句比比皆是。但是，正如法国人从前唱完歌要付钱一样，这一次，他们笑完之后也付了钱：一百二十五万三千九百三十法郎。出了这么一大笔钱，他们完全有理由说笑一番了。

奥地利虽然财政困难，但也表现得比较慷慨。它从税收中拿出二十一万六千弗罗林，数目不小，颇受称赞。

瑞典和挪威捐出五万二千里克斯达尔[35]。对这两个国家来说，这笔钱已经不少了。不过，如果在克里斯蒂安尼亚和斯德哥尔摩同时搞募捐的话，捐款肯定会更多的。挪威人不知何故，反正不喜欢把自己的钱寄往瑞典去。

普鲁士人捐出二十五万塔勒[36]，表明他们高度赞赏这一试验。

土耳其人也很大方。不过，话说回来，这个试验与他们的国家利益息息相关。事实上，它的年历和斋戒日都是依据月球的运行而制定的。所以，他们捐出了一百三十七万两千六百四十皮阿斯特[37]，表现出了极大的热情；不过，这其中夹杂着土耳其苏丹政府施加的一些压力。

在二流国家中，比利时独占鳌头，捐出了五十一万三千法郎，相当于每个比利时人大约捐了两生丁。

荷兰及其殖民地对这个试验也比较感兴趣，捐赠了十一万弗罗林，但是要求返还百分之五的折扣，因为他们付的是现金。

丹麦虽然国土面积有点儿小，但是也捐出了九千个足色金币杜卡托[38]，这足以证明丹麦人对科学探险的热爱。

日耳曼联邦保证捐赠三万四千二百八十五弗罗林（72000法郎），它不会再多出了，即使再要求，它也不会答应的。

意大利显然很拮据，但仍从人们的口袋里掏出了二十万里拉，不过这已经把他们的口袋全都翻了个遍。如果威尼托地区还属于它的话就好了，可惜威尼托地区已经不属于它了。

教皇国认为，捐赠数额不应少于七千零四十罗马埃居；而葡萄牙为表达自己对科学的忠诚信仰，捐出三万克鲁扎多[39]。

瑞士为美国的这项伟大事业提供了两百五十七法郎。必须实话实说，瑞士并不看好这个试验；它并不认为往月球上发射一颗炮弹就能真的同月球建立起任何联系，它觉得把资金投到这么毫无把握的事情上是很轻率的。不过，瑞士也许言之有理。

至于西班牙，它是不可能筹集到多于一百一十里亚尔[40]的。它的借口是它有多条铁路等待完工。而真实的情况是，科学在这个国家并不被看好，还比较落后。另外，有一些西班牙人虽然并不是没有知识，但是却不完全清楚，与月球的体积相比，炮弹的个头儿有多大。他们害怕炮弹会干扰月球的运行轨道，破坏它的地球卫星的作用，导致月球坠落到地球上。那样的话，还是放弃的好。因此，他们只出了几个里亚尔意思意思。

还有就是英国了。大家知道英国对巴比凯恩的建议是嗤之以鼻的。大不列颠岛上的两千五百万英国人只有一种共同的精神。他们暗示大炮俱乐部的行为是有悖于“不干涉原则”的，所以他们一个子儿也不出。

听到英国人的说法，大炮俱乐部的会员们只是耸了耸肩，不予理会，只顾忙自己的伟大事业了。南美洲，也就是秘鲁、智利、巴西、拉普拉塔河流域的各省以及哥伦比亚，分别捐赠了各自的份额，总计三十万美元，列在捐赠榜单的首位。以下是捐赠款的总数：

美国捐款：4000000美元

外国捐款：1446675美元

总计：5446675美元

以上即为公众捐到大炮俱乐部的钱柜里的5446675美元。

请大家千万别对这么一大笔钱款感到惊讶。铸炮、钻孔、筑墙、运送工匠、把工匠们安置在一个几乎荒无人烟的地方、建造熔炉和房屋、工厂的设备、火药、炮弹、额外支出等，根据工程预算，几乎会将这笔钱花得一干二净。南北战争时期，某些大炮的炮弹需花上一千美元；而巴比凯恩的这颗在枪炮史册上独一无二的炮弹，很可能得贵上五千倍不止。

十月二十日，大炮俱乐部同纽约附近的科尔德斯普林工厂签订了一份协议。该厂曾在战争期间向帕罗特提供了它最好的铸铁炮。缔约双方规定，科尔德斯普林工厂负责将铸造哥伦比亚大炮所需的物资运往佛罗里达州南部的坦帕城。这一运输任务最迟必须在第二年十月十五日完成，而且必须保证交付使用的大炮完美无缺，否则将处以每天一百美元的罚金，直到月球在同样条件下出现为止，也就是说，到十八年零十一天之后。

另外还规定，工匠的招聘、他们工资的发放、必要的管理工作，一并由科尔德斯普林工厂负责。

这份真诚的协议一式两份，由大炮俱乐部主席因比·巴比凯恩和科尔德斯普林工厂厂长T.默奇森共同签字，立即生效。





第十三章　乱石岗


自从大炮俱乐部的会员们做出了有损于得克萨斯州的选择之后，在人人都读书识字的美国，每个人都把研究佛罗里达州的地理视为一种义务。书商们从未卖出过如此多的有关地理方面的书籍，如巴特朗的《佛罗里达游记》、罗曼的《佛罗里达东西部自然史》、威廉的《佛罗里达版图》、克莱朗的《论佛罗里达东部的甘蔗种植》等。这些书籍一版再版，盛况空前。

巴比凯恩可无暇看书，他要做的事情太多了。他要亲自查看并确定哥伦比亚大炮的铸造点。因此，他立即把制造一架天文望远镜的必需资金划拨给了剑桥天文台，还同奥尔巴尼的布雷德维尔公司签订了铸造铝弹的合同。随后，他在J.T.马斯顿、埃尔菲斯通少校以及科尔德斯普林工厂厂长的陪同下，离开了巴尔的摩。

第二天，这四位到达了新奥尔良。他们在那儿立即登上了政府拨给他们乘坐的美利坚合众国海军护卫舰“坦皮科”号，随即点火起航，很快便驶离了路易斯安那海岸。

航程并不遥远。起程两天之后，“坦皮科”号便航行了四百八十英里，到达佛罗里达海岸。在驶近海岸时，巴比凯恩看到的是一片平坦的低洼地，十分贫瘠。驶过一个又一个盛产牡蛎和龙虾的小海湾之后，“坦皮科”号便进入埃斯皮里图桑托湾了。十月二十二日晚七点，“坦皮科”号在希尔斯伯勒河口形成的一个天然小港口停泊，四位乘客立即下了船。

“先生们，”巴比凯恩说道，“我们时间紧迫，从明天起，我们将骑马去勘察这片土地。”

巴比凯恩一踏上陆地，立即受到坦帕城三千居民的热烈欢迎，这是这位选定他们的土地来做试验的大炮俱乐部主席应该获得的殊荣。

但是，巴比凯恩急匆匆地离开了欢呼的人群，躲进富兰克林旅馆的一个房间。

第二天，十月二十三日，一些健壮活跃的西班牙矮种马在他的窗下踢蹬着。可是，并不是四匹，而是五十匹，骑手们都骑在马背上。巴比凯恩领着他的三位同伴连忙下楼，置身于这么大的一支马队之中，一下子都怔住了。另外，他发现每一个骑手肩上都斜背着一支马枪，马匹两边的手枪皮套里还插着手枪。

见他满脸疑惑，一个年轻的佛罗里达人立即上前向他道明这么炫耀武力的缘由，解释道：

“先生，这里有许多塞米诺尔人。”

“塞米诺尔人？”

“半游牧民，是一些野蛮人，在草原上四处流窜，所以我们觉得应该护卫您。”

“哼！”J.T.马斯顿边上马边哼了一声。

“反正，这样要保险一些。”那佛罗里达青年又说道。

“先生们，”巴比凯恩回答道，“我非常感谢诸位这么关心我们。好了，咱们走吧！”

这时是清晨五点。巴比凯恩和他的同伴离开坦帕城，沿着海岸，向阿利菲小溪走去。这条小溪在坦帕城上方十二英里处流入希尔斯伯勒湾。巴比凯恩一行人沿着小溪右岸往东行进。海湾的波涛很快便隐没于蜿蜒起伏的地面后面了，展现在他眼前的只是佛罗里达的田野。

佛罗里达州是由胡安·庞斯·德莱昂在一五一二年圣枝主日[41]那一天发现的，被命名为“鲜花盛开的复活节岛”。不过，有着干旱炎热海岸的它并不配拥有这么迷人的名字。然而，在离岸边几英里处，土质在逐渐改变，该地区才无愧于它那迷人的名字。不一会儿，眼前便呈现出种满植物的平原，北方的和南方的蔬菜比比皆是。种有菠萝、木薯、烟草、水稻、棉花和甘蔗的田地广袤无垠，一望无际，展示着肥沃的土地，丰硕的收获。

巴比凯恩看到地势在逐步升高，十分满意。这时候，J.T.马斯顿就这一点问他时，他回答道：

“尊敬的朋友，我们最感兴趣的就是在高地上铸造我们的哥伦比亚大炮。”

“为了离月球近一点儿吧？”大炮俱乐部秘书大声说道。

“不完全是。”巴比凯恩面带笑容地回答道，“在高地中间，我们的工作就会更容易一点儿——我们将不必跟水斗争了，省去安装那费时、费力、费钱的长长的水管道了。因此，让我们想办法，在一块高于海平面数百托瓦兹的地方开挖我们的坑洞吧。”

“您说得对，巴比凯恩先生。”工程师默奇森说道，“如果我没弄错的话，我们很快就将找到一个合适的地方。”

“好啊！我想挖第一镐。”巴比凯恩主席说。

“那我就挖最后一镐吧！”J.T.马斯顿大声嚷道。

将近上午十点，这一小队人马走了有十二英里左右的路程。肥沃的田野过后，接着是一片林区，生长着各种各样的热带树木。在这片几乎难以进入的大森林里，有石榴树、柑橘树、柠檬树、无花果树、橄榄树、杏树、香蕉树、粗壮的葡萄藤，真是花儿朵朵，果实累累，五颜六色，香气四溢。在这些美不胜收、香气十足的大树的枝叶下，百鸟翻飞，欢声歌唱。

J. T.马斯顿和少校置身在这大自然的美景之中，啧啧称羡，流连忘返。但是，巴比凯恩主席对这人间仙境却无动于衷，只顾往前赶路。这片土地如此肥沃，反倒引起他的不悦。因此，大家仍在往前走着。途中必须蹚过好些条小河，这也相当危险，因为河里满是凯门鳄，足有十五到十八英尺长。J.T.马斯顿用他那可怕的铁钩大胆地吓唬它们，不过他只是把河岸边的那些“野居民”——鹈鹕、野鸭给惊飞了，而一群群体形很大的火烈鸟则呆呆地看着他。

最后，这些湿地上的不速之客离开了。树木逐渐稀少，稀稀拉拉地散布在不太茂密的林地上。有几丛孤单零落的小树显现在无垠的平原上，只见一群群受惊的鹿在奔跑。

“好了！总算到了松林地区了！”巴比凯恩大声叫道。

“这也是野人出没之地。”少校说道。

果然，远方影影绰绰可见几个塞米诺尔人，他们情绪激动，骑着快马跑来跑去，手举着长矛或用步枪射击。不过，他们也只是在表明他们的敌视态度，并无其他举动，所以巴比凯恩及其同伴们并不担心什么。

这时，他们来到一块遍地石头的平原中央。这是一块开阔地，足有好几英亩，火辣辣的阳光照射在它上面。它由一块很宽阔的隆起的土地形成，仿佛在向大炮俱乐部的那几位会员展现它具备安装哥伦比亚大炮的所有必需之条件。

“停下！”巴比凯恩说着便停了下来，“这个地方在当地叫什么？”

“乱石岗。”一个佛罗里达人回答道。

巴比凯恩没有吭声，翻身下马，拿起他的仪器，开始极其精确地测量自己所在的方位。其他的人围在他身旁，悄无声息地看着他。

此刻，太阳经过子午线了。不一会儿，巴比凯恩迅速地计算出并记录下了观测结果，说道：

“这个地方海拔一千八百英尺，位于北纬27°7'，西经5°7'[42]。我觉得此处土质干燥、多石，完全符合我们的试验条件。因此，我们将在这儿建造我们的弹药库、车间、熔炉以及工棚。我们的炮弹，”他用脚猛踩乱石岗的山头，说道，“就在这儿，就从这儿，飞向太阳系！”





第十四章　十字镐和镘刀


当晚，巴比凯恩及其同伴们回到了坦帕城，而默奇森工程师则登上“坦皮科”号返回新奥尔良了。他要回去招募许多工匠，并且要将大量的物资运来。大炮俱乐部的会员们在坦帕城住了下来，以便在当地人的帮助之下，着手准备开工。

“坦皮科”号驶离八天之后，回到了埃斯皮里图桑托湾，一队蒸汽船跟在它的后面也进了港。默奇森招募到一千五百名劳工。由于受到大炮俱乐部提供的很高的报酬以及丰厚奖金的吸引，经他的手招募来的劳动人员，都是一些出色的烧火工、铸铁工、石灰煅烧工、矿工、制砖工以及各行各业的小工。这里有黑人也有白人，不分肤色。其中的许多人都把自己的家属带了来。这是一次真正的大移民。

十月三十一日上午十点，这支劳动大军登上了坦帕城的码头。不难想象，一日之间，小城的人口一下子翻了一番，熙熙攘攘，热闹非凡。

开头几天，大家都忙着把船队运送来的设备卸下来，其中有机器，还有食物，以及非常多可拆卸、编了号的铁皮组装的活动房。与此同时，巴比凯恩还设置了第一批长十五英里、旨在连接乱石岗和坦帕城的铁路路标。十一月一日，巴比凯恩领着一小队工匠离开了坦帕城；自第二天起，乱石岗周围那由活动房搭建起来的城市便出现了。城市周围用栅栏围了起来，生机勃勃，热热闹闹；大家很快便把它视为美利坚合众国的大城市之一了。城里的生活有条不紊，工程也按部就班地开始了。

通过事先的精心勘测，他们了解了土地的性质，所以，十一月四日就得以开挖。

这一天，巴比凯恩把工头们召集起来，对他们说道：“朋友们，你们大家都知道，我为什么要把你们集中到佛罗里达州的这片荒僻之地来。是因为要铸造一门炮，内径九英尺，壁厚六英尺，并覆有十九英尺半厚的石头保护层。因此，必须挖一个大大的坑洞，直径六十英尺，深九百英尺。这项庞大的工程八个月内必须完成。因此，你们在两百五十五天之内，必须挖掘两百五十四万三千四百立方英尺的土；凑个整数，也就是每天要挖一万立方英尺的土。当然，对于一千个行动完全自由的工匠来说，这并没有什么困难；但是，在一个相对狭小的空间里干活儿，就比较艰难了。然而，这项工程既然应该做，那就要做好，我相信你们既有这种勇气又不缺乏技巧。”

上午八点，第一镐凿在了佛罗里达州的土地上；自这一刻起，这些工具在矿工们的手中就没有停歇过片刻。工匠们每三小时轮班休息一次。

十一月四日，五十名工匠在围起来的场地中央，也就是乱石岗的最高处，挖了一个直径六十英尺的圆形坑洞。十字镐首先碰到的是一种厚六英寸的黑土，很容易挖。随后便是一层两英尺厚的细沙土，工匠们细心地将它们收拢起来，留作以后制内层模子用。这层细沙土的下面是一种白色黏土，相当硬实，类似于英国的泥灰石，厚四英尺。再往下挖，十字镐碰上了地下的坚硬土层，火星四溅，那是一种由很干、很硬的贝壳化石构成的岩石层，所有工具都挖不动。坑洞到这儿为止，已有六英尺半深了，于是，便开始砌井壁。

在这个坑洞底部，人们制作了一个橡木“圆轮”，是一种用螺栓牢牢地固定住的不怕挤压的坚固圆盘，中心部位凿了圆洞，直径与哥伦比亚大炮的外径相等。井壁的头几块基石就砌在它的上面，水泥把它们结结实实地粘在一起。工匠们从外围往中央砌着，最后被关在了一口直径二十一英尺的井里。当这个活儿干完之后，工匠们又拿起鹤嘴锄和十字镐，开始挖掘木圆盘下方的岩石，并小心翼翼地用一些非常结实的“龙骨墩”（一种支架）支撑住木圆盘。每向下挖掘两英尺，他们便把这些龙骨墩抽出来，木圆盘便逐渐往下落去，而砌好的圆形井壁石基也在往下落。工匠们不停地砌着井壁，壁上留着“出气孔”，以使铸造大炮时产生的气体从孔中溢出。

这种活计要求工匠们技术娴熟，不得有一时一刻的疏忽大意。在挖掘木圆盘下方的岩石时，不少工匠被崩起的石块击成重伤，甚至致命；但是，他们的热情并未消减，仍在夜以继日地拼命干着。白天，强烈的阳光毫无顾忌地洒向工地；夜晚，在一盏盏电灯的白光之下，鹤嘴锄挖掘岩石的声响、雷管的爆炸声、机器的轰鸣声响成一片；还有那飘浮在空中的滚滚浓烟，在乱石岗周围形成一个巨大而骇人的黑圈。无论是成群结队的野牛，还是一伙一伙的塞米诺尔人，都不敢靠近。不过，工程正常地推进着，蒸汽吊车在忙着吊运物资。很少出现未曾预料到的困难，所遇到的困难都是事先考虑到的，并被巧妙地解决了。

第一个月过去了，洞深达到了一个月所预定的目标——一百一十二英尺。十二月份，洞深翻了一番；一月份，深度达到第一个月的三倍。

二月，工匠们不得不对付出现在眼前的地下含水层。工匠们使用大功率的水泵和空气压缩机把水抽干，然后像堵住船的漏水处一样，用混凝土把出水口给堵上。最后，这些该死的水流终于被制服了。不过，由于土层松动，木圆盘出现了局部的断裂，而且井壁也出现了部分塌陷。这次意外夺去了好几个工匠的生命。

自此之后，没有再出现任何新的意外来妨碍工程的进展。六月十日，离巴比凯恩确定的完工日期还有二十天，这个坑洞的石壁已经全部砌好，深度达到九百英尺。井壁底部立于一个三十英尺厚的巨大的圆墩上，而它的顶端则与地面持平。

巴比凯恩主席和大炮俱乐部的会员们热烈地祝贺默奇森工程师，赞扬他以极快的速度完成了这项巨大的工程。

在这八个月中，巴比凯恩一刻也没离开过乱石岗。他在密切地关注挖掘工程的同时，始终没有忘记关心他的工匠们的福利待遇和身体健康。他很高兴他们避开了那些人口密集的地方常有的传染病，这些疫病在赤道地区热带气候条件之下极具灾难性。

的确，有好几个工匠因干这种危险活儿而丢了性命，但是，这种不幸又是无法避免的；再说，在美国人看来，这算不了什么，他们也不太在乎。他们更关注的是整个人类而非某个个人。

不过，巴比凯恩却与之相反，他始终在贯彻既关乎人类又关乎个人的原则。因此，幸亏有他的细心关怀、他的足智多谋、他在困难情况之下的有力干预，以及他那非凡的仁慈和远见卓识，这项工程的平均灾难发生率才没有超过海外那些采取了大量防范措施的国家，特别是法国；据估计，大约每一项二十万法郎的工程就有一起事故发生。





第十五章　铸炮欢庆


在挖井工程进行的那八个月时间里，铸炮的准备工作也以极快的速度同时在进行。如果一个外地来的人来到乱石岗，他会对呈现在眼前的景象感到十分惊讶。

在离井口六百码的地方，围绕中心点垒起了一千二百个反射炉，每个炉子直径六英尺，彼此间隔半托瓦兹。这一千二百个反射炉连接起来形成一条线的话，可长达两英里。它们全都是一个模式，都有一个四角形的高大烟囱，景象十分壮观。

大家记得，委员会召开第三次会议时，便决心使用铸铁铸造哥伦比亚大炮，还特别指定用灰铸铁来造。这种金属的确更加有韧性，有延展性，更加易于锻压，易于镗孔，适应各种模具铸模；而且，经泥煤处理之后，质地上乘，适合制作各种高强度的机件，比如大炮、蒸汽压路机、水压机等。

不过，铸铁如果只经过一次熔化的话，很难保持质地均衡，必须通过第二次熔化，除去它最后的那些泥土杂质之后，才能变得纯净无瑕。因此，铁矿石在运往坦帕城之前，必须先在科尔德斯普林的高炉里加工处理，在高温之下与炭和硅接触，进行碳化，并转化成铸铁。经过第一道工序之后，铸铁被运到乱石岗。但是，一亿三千六百万磅的铸铁，如果通过铁路运输的话，运费十分昂贵，比材料的费用多一倍。看来，在纽约租一些船，装上铸铁锭更划算一些；但这也起码得租六十八条载重一千吨的大船，那可真算得上一支船队了。五月三日，这支大船队驶离纽约，于当月十日在圣埃斯皮里图湾靠岸，毫发未损地停泊在坦帕城港口。船上的铸铁被卸到码头，装到通往乱石岗的火车上。一月中旬[43]，这堆积如山的金属终于运抵目的地。

不难想象，要同时熔炼这六万吨铸铁，一千二百个熔炉也不算太多。每个熔炉可容纳将近十四万磅的金属。它们都是按照当年为铸造罗德曼大炮所需之铸铁的模式建造的，呈梯形，非常低矮。加热装置和烟囱都在熔炉两端，因而熔炉各个部位都能均匀受热。熔炉全都用耐火砖制成，只装置着一个用以燃烧泥煤的铁架，以及一张摆放铸铁锭的“炉床”。这张“炉床”呈二十五度角倾斜，以便熔化了的金属得以流入承流器里；然后，一千两百条槽沟便将金属液引向中央基坑之中。

井壁和坑洞工程完工后的第二天，巴比凯恩便着手制造内模：在坑洞的中心，以它的轴心为基准，立起一个九百英尺高、直径九英尺的圆柱，它毫厘不差地填满留给哥伦比亚大炮炮膛的空间。该圆柱由黏土和沙土混合制成，其中掺了一些干草和稻草。铸模和井壁之间留下的空隙得灌满金属液，这些金属液将成为六英尺厚的炮筒壁。为了让这个大圆柱保持平衡，必须用一些铁框架将它固定住，并每隔一段用横梁插入井壁，加以支撑。炮壁铸成之后，这些横梁便与已凝固的金属契合在一起，外表看不出任何痕迹了。

七月八日，铸模工程宣告结束，第二天将开始铸炮。

“铸炮的开工仪式肯定很精彩。”J.T.马斯顿对他的朋友巴比凯恩说道。

“当然，”巴比凯恩回答道，“不过，那不会是一个公众的节日！”

“怎么！您不把围墙的门打开让人们前来参观吗？”

“小心为佳，马斯顿。铸造哥伦比亚大炮尽管不能说是一种危险的试验，但也是一种大意不得的试验哪。我宁愿关起门来铸造它。到发射炮弹的时候，如果愿意的话，倒是可以庆贺一番，但在这之前，庆祝是绝对不可以的。”

巴比凯恩主席说的是有道理的。这种试验可能会出现一些预料不到的危险，而观者如云的话，一旦遇到危险，场面必然一片混乱，无法控制。必须保证试验不受任何干扰。除了前来坦帕城的大炮俱乐部会员们的一个代表团之外，任何人都不得进入围墙内。该代表团成员包括潇洒倜傥的比尔斯比、汤姆·亨特、布洛姆斯贝瑞上校、埃尔菲斯通少校、摩根将军等人，对他们来说，铸造哥伦比亚大炮已经变成他们个人的事情了。J.T.马斯顿充当起他们的向导来，向他们讲解每一个细节，带他们四处参观，去弹药库，去车间，去机器中间，还硬要让他们一个一个地参观那一千二百个熔炉。等参观到第一千二百个熔炉时，他们已经实在是累得受不了了。

铸炮在正午时开始。前一天，每座炉子都装满了十一万四千磅的铁锭，交叉叠放着，以便热气得以在铁锭中间自由流动。从早晨起，那一千二百座熔炉便开始向空中喷吐出大量的火焰，大地都在颤动着。装填了多少磅的金属，就得燃烧多少磅的煤。因此，六万八千吨煤同时在阳光的照射下喷出浓烟，形成一块厚厚的黑幕布。很快，熔炉圈内的温度直线上升，让人无法忍受，再加上轰隆声响成一片，如雷声滚滚。大功率的鼓风机也夹杂其中，呼呼地连续地往炉内吹风，氧气充足，炉火很旺。要想成功，就得快速完成这项工作。号炮一响，每个熔炉就必须立即把金属液引出，让炉子排空。一切安排就绪之后，工头们和工匠们都怀着一种激动而焦急的心情，等待着那决定性时刻的到来。熔炉圈内的人全都被疏散开了，而每个熔炉炉长都守候在金属液槽边，坚守着自己的岗位。

巴比凯恩及其同事们站在近旁的一个高处，观看出炉。他们前面放着一门大炮，等工程师一发信号便发炮。正午前几分钟，有小滴小滴的金属液开始流出，承流器渐渐积满。铸铁完全熔化之后，还得在承流器里待上片刻，以便让金属液里的杂质沉淀下去。

十二点整。突然一声炮响，一道黄褐色的光亮在空中一闪。一千二百个金属液槽同时打开，只见一千二百条火蛇向中央基坑爬行着。到了基坑边，只听见一阵可怕的巨响，金属液便哗哗地向九百英尺深的深渊滚滚地倾泻着。场面十分壮观，非常激动人心。金属液一边向空中喷吐着滚滚浓烟，一边让铸模里的湿气蒸腾，变成一股股的蒸汽，从井壁的通气孔中冒出来。这时候，大地都在颤动。这些假云假雾呈螺旋状向天穹升腾，直达五百托瓦兹的高空。如果远方有个野人，看到这番景象的话，还以为佛罗里达州深处可能有一处火山在喷发。不过，那可不是火山爆发，不是龙卷风，不是暴风雨，不是大自然在发威。不是！全都不是！是人的威力，是人在制造这些红褐色的蒸汽，是人在制造这些可与火山媲美的巨大火焰，是人在制造这些宛如地震一般的、可怕的、震耳欲聋的声响，是人在制造这些与狂风骤雨匹敌的轰鸣，是人的双手在把像尼亚加拉大瀑布似的金属液倾入自己挖出的深渊中！





第十六章　哥伦比亚大炮


铸铁工程成功了吗？我们只能对此做一些简单的推测。不过，所有一切都让人觉得它是成功的，因为铸模已经把熔炉里的金属液全部吸收了。虽然如此，还是需要很长的时间才能对此进行正式确定。

在这期间，大炮俱乐部会员们的耐心受到了严峻的考验。但是，急也没有用，他们只能耐心地等待着。J.T.马斯顿更是急不可耐。熔铁工作完成后的第十五天，一个硕大无比的烟柱仍然耸立在空中；乱石岗顶上，方圆二百英尺以内，地面仍烫得无法下脚。人们根本不可能靠近它，只好等待。大炮俱乐部的会员们无可奈何地苦苦等待着。

“今天都八月十日了，”一天早晨，J.T.马斯顿大声说道，“离十二月一日只有不到四个月了！我们会来不及准备的！”巴比凯恩却什么也不说，但他的沉默隐含着愠怒。

不过，通过每天的观测，人们还是发现地面的情况出现了某些变化。将近八月十五日，喷发出来的蒸汽的强度和浓度明显地在降低。几天之后，地面只散发出一层薄薄的水汽。渐渐地，大地的颤动消失了，热量散发的范围缩小了。到了八月二十二日，巴比凯恩及其同事们和工程师终于可以踏到铸铁上面去了，而铸铁的最高层面与乱石岗顶层持平。

“总算成功了！”大炮俱乐部主席深深地吐了一口气，大声地说道。

当天，工程便又继续下去。他们立即着手内模的清除工作，以保证炮壁畅通无阻。鹤嘴锄、打孔器在忙碌地工作着。黏土和沙土因热力作用变得十分坚实。但是，有机器相帮，与炮壁粘黏在一起的、仍然热乎乎的这种泥沙混合物，还是被清除掉了。清除下来的杂物被立即装车运走了。大家干得热火朝天，巴比凯恩又督促得紧，再加上他用美元来刺激众人，所以到了九月三日，铸模的残迹全被清除得一干二净了。

跟着，镗孔的工作便开始了。大功率的铰刀开动起来，几个星期之后，巨大的炮筒的内层表面已被铰刀磨成圆筒状，炮壁也十分光滑。

最后，九月二十二日，离巴比凯恩的报告不到一年的时间，这尊大炮，口径精确无误，垂直竖立起来，准备好发射了。现在就只剩等着月亮了。不过，大家相信，月亮是不会爽约的。

J. T.马斯顿高兴得有点儿忘乎所以，他急不可耐地探头观察炮筒时，差一点儿就跌下去了。幸亏尊贵的布洛姆斯贝瑞上校眼疾手快，伸出右臂一把将他搂住，大炮俱乐部秘书才幸免于难，否则J.T.马斯顿就成了又一位埃罗斯特拉托斯[44]，葬身于哥伦比亚大炮的炮筒底部了。

大炮铸好了；毋庸置疑，完美无比。因此，十月六日，尼科尔船长无可奈何，只得对巴比凯恩主席履行诺言，往巴比凯恩的户头上汇入两千美元。不难想象，尼科尔船长嘴都要气歪了，简直咽不下这口气。不过，还有三个赌注——三千、四千和五千的——尚未见分晓；只要能赢得其中的两个赌注，那么，虽然说不上大赚一笔，但也并不是输得很惨。不过，他气的并非是钱的得失，而是他的对手的大炮竟然让他的六十英尺厚的钢板无可奈何，这可是给了他可怕的一击。

自九月二十三日起，乱石岗的围墙便向公众敞开了，观看者一下子便像潮水般涌了进来。大家在坦帕城和乱石岗之间来来回回不停地走动着，成群结队，络绎不绝，犹如朝圣一般。

人们已经能够预见到，试验的那一天，观者将会达到数百万之多，因为他们已经从全球各地聚集到这块狭长的陆地上来了。整个欧洲在往美国移民。

不过，必须指出，到目前为止，这如云般的观者的好奇心只得到了一点点满足而已。许多人原指望能观看铸炮的场景，但是看到的却只是团团的烟雾。这对他们贪婪的目光来说是太少太少了，可是，巴比凯恩就是不准任何人走近试验场。因而，人们深感不快，嘟嘟囔囔，怨声载道，指责大炮俱乐部主席的声音四起，说他专横跋扈，说他的方式“缺少美国味”。乱石岗围墙周围差点发生骚乱。但大家知道，巴比凯恩不为所动，决心不改。但是，当哥伦比亚大炮的铸造工作全部完成的时候，严禁参观的禁令已无法执行。再说，壁垒森严也太不合情理，甚至会惹恼公众，那就很麻烦了。于是，巴比凯恩便向所有来者敞开了大门。不过，他是个讲求实际的人，决定利用公众的好奇心赚点儿钱。

对于美国人来说，能够观赏巨型的哥伦比亚大炮已经是非常非常高兴的事了；但是，如果能够下到它的底部去看一看，那他们会觉得自己是“世界上最最幸福的人”了。因此，没有一个好奇者不愿意享有欣赏这个巨大的金属深渊的快乐。一些吊在蒸汽绞盘车上的吊箱使得观众们的好奇心得到了满足。人们像疯了似的。女人、孩子、老人全都乐此不疲，非要深入炮筒底部看清巨炮的秘密不可。下去一趟的票价为每人五美元，尽管价格不菲，在试验前的两个月里，大炮俱乐部还是赚了近五十万美元。

不用说，哥伦比亚大炮的首批参观者是大炮俱乐部的会员，这个杰出团体理所当然地享有这一优先权。这一盛典于九月二十五日举行。一只贵宾吊箱把巴比凯恩主席、J.T.马斯顿、埃尔菲斯通少校、摩根将军、布洛姆斯贝瑞上校以及该俱乐部的其他几位尊贵的会员送了下去。一共有十个人。这个金属长筒的底部仍然很热。大家在下面感到有点儿憋闷，但是心里却是极其高兴的！多么迷人啊！哥伦比亚大炮的石台上支了一张餐桌，摆放着十副餐具，一束电灯光把大炮照得亮如白昼。无数的珍肴佳馔仿佛从天而降，一道一道地摆在宾客们的面前，而且法国最上等的葡萄美酒也在这九百英尺深的地下不停地流淌着。

盛宴气氛热烈，欢声笑语不断，觥筹交错。他们为地球干杯，为它的卫星干杯，为大炮俱乐部干杯，为美利坚合众国干杯，为月亮干杯，为月亮女神菲贝干杯，为狄安娜干杯，为满月女神塞勒涅干杯，为“宁静的天穹使者”干杯！欢呼声、干杯声、笑声通过巨型传声筒像雷鸣一般传到上面，围在乱石岗周围的人群与地下的宾客们一样激动着，幸福着，跟着一起欢呼着。

J. T.马斯顿已经难以抑制自己激动的心情了。他是否发出的叫喊声比他做的手势多，他是否喝的比吃的要多，没人能够说得清楚。反正即使用一个帝国来换他此时此刻的位置，他也不会干的。他说道：“不，即使大炮装满了火药，马上开炮，把我炸得粉碎，打到太空，我也不在乎。”





第十七章　一封电报


大炮俱乐部的那些重大工程可以说已经结束了，但是，离向月球发射炮弹的时间还有两个月。对于全世界翘首以待的人们来说，两个月宛如数年一般漫长！在炮弹发射那一天之前，报纸每天都连篇累牍地刊登关于发射的哪怕是最微小的细节，人们以热情而贪婪的目光研读着报纸。

其实，这是根本不会出现的情况：最出乎意料的、最新奇特别的、最难以置信的、最像是不真实的一件事又重新刺激了焦躁不安的人们的神经，让全世界都为之震惊，兴奋不已。

九月三十日这一天，凌晨三点四十七分，巴比凯恩主席接到了一封通过爱尔兰瓦伦西亚、纽芬兰岛和美洲大陆的海底电缆传来的电报。

巴比凯恩主席立即打开了电报，尽管他自制力很强，但嘴唇仍然发白，视力逐渐模糊不清。其实电报的字数并不多。

这封电报现保存在大炮俱乐部的档案馆里，全文如下：

美国佛罗里达州坦帕城　巴比凯恩收

应用锥形圆柱体炮弹代替圆形炮弹。本人愿置身于炮弹之内随

之飞往月球。我将乘“亚特兰大”号轮船抵美。

米歇尔·阿尔当

于法国巴黎

九月三十日晨四点[45]





第十八章　“亚特兰大”号轮船上的乘客


如果这个惊天动地的消息不是从海底电缆传送而来的，而是通过邮局封签寄来的，那么巴比凯恩会毫不犹豫地把它随手扔掉。而且，他会因为小心谨慎和不影响他的杰作的声誉而缄默不语。这封电报可能是个骗局，特别是它出自一个法国人之手。一个普普通通的人，就算是胆大包天，又怎么会突发奇想要去月球旅行呢？即使有这么一个人，那他也是个疯子，应该将他关进疯人院，而不是把他装在炮弹里。

但是，电报内容已经传开了，因为电报传送机本身就缺少保密性。米歇尔·阿尔当的建议已经在美利坚合众国各州传遍了。这么一来，巴比凯恩就没有任何理由保持沉默了。因此，他把尚留在坦帕城的同事们召集起来，随便地把那简短的电文读了一遍，既没向他们吐露自己的看法，也没有让大家讨论电文的可信度。与会者们既用语言又用在此情况之下所必有的手势，发泄了自己的怀疑、愤怒和不屑之情。只有J.T.马斯顿突发一言，语惊四座。“这倒也是个好主意！”他大声说道。

当巴比凯恩建议向月球发射一颗炮弹的时候，人人都认为这一试验合乎情理，切实可行，是一个纯属重炮射击学的问题！可如今，却冒出一个并不是疯子的人偏偏提出来要置身炮弹之中，准备做一次异想天开的旅行，整个事情就变成了一场闹剧，用准确地翻译成本国语言的法国词语来说，简直就是一个“骗局”[46]。

不过，先得弄清：是否真的有这么个人？这封通过大西洋底传送来的电报，那个法国人声称的自己乘坐的那艘轮船的名字，以及所指明的到达日期等所有这些情况，表明他的建议具有某种真实性。必须将这些情况全都弄清楚。很快，人们就分别组合起来，越聚越多，从而形成一个密集的人群，向着巴比凯恩主席的住处走去。巴比凯恩主席自收到电报时起，就没有发表过任何个人意见，他缄默不语，静观事态发展。公众都按捺不住了，可他却以一种极其不悦的目光看着聚集在他窗下的坦帕城的民众们。很快，嘟哝声、谩骂声把他逼了出来。他站到了窗前，民众安静下来。随即，一位公民说话了。他单刀直入地向巴比凯恩提出下面这个问题：“电报上署名米歇尔·阿尔当的人是不是正在前来美国的路上？是，还是不是？”

“先生们，”巴比凯恩回答道，“我并不比你们知道得多。”

“必须弄清楚这个问题！”一些人不耐烦地大声嚷叫道。

“时间将会告诉我们的！”巴比凯恩主席冷冷地回答道。

“时间无权让整个国家的人心存疑惑。”那个带头发言的人又说道，“您是否根据那封电报所要求的那样修改了炮弹图纸？”

“还没有，先生们；不过，你们说得对，必须弄清楚到底是怎么回事。电报局引起了这么大的混乱，它应该提供更多的情况。”

“找电报局去！”民众们叫嚷着。

巴比凯恩走下楼来。他走在庞大队伍的前头，带着大家向电报局大楼走去。几分钟之后，一封电报发给了利物浦船舶经纪人联合会。人们在电报中要求对方就下列问题给予答复：

“‘亚特兰大’号是什么样的船？它什么时候离开的欧洲？船上是否有一个名叫米歇尔·阿尔当的法国人乘坐？”

两小时过后，巴比凯恩收到了回电，内容十分明确，无可怀疑。

利物浦的“亚特兰大”号于十月二日起航，驶往坦帕城，船上有一名法国乘客，登记簿上写的是米歇尔·阿尔当。

不过，当天晚上，他便立即修书一封，寄往布雷德维尔公司，请求对方暂停铸造炮弹的工作，等待新的命令下达。十月十日，上午九点，巴哈马运河信号台报告，远方地平线上有一股浓烟。两个小时之后，一艘大型蒸汽轮船与信号台进行了信号联络。于是，“亚特兰大”号的名字立即传到了坦帕城。四点钟，这艘英国轮船驶入埃斯皮里图桑托湾。五点钟，它全速穿越了希利斯波洛湾。六点钟，它停泊在坦帕港。还没等船锚钩住海底，便有五百条小船把“亚特兰大”号团团围住，使它动弹不得。巴比凯恩第一个跨过船舷，用难以抑制的声音喊道：“米歇尔·阿尔当！”

“我在这儿！”有个站在艉楼上的人应答道。

巴比凯恩双臂交叉，嘴唇紧闭，用询问的目光盯着“亚特兰大”号上的这位乘客。

此人四十二岁，身材高挑，但已经有点儿驼背。他脑袋很大，状若狮子头，不时地甩动他那像狮鬣般的火红的头发。他短脸阔额，八字胡竖起，似猫胡须一般，长着一簇簇黄褐色的络腮胡，眼睛圆圆的，目光有点儿茫然，两只近视眼眯缝着，让整张脸看着更像是猫脸了。但是，他的鼻子却是又大又挺，嘴巴又尤为讨人喜爱，额头很高，显出聪明样儿，上面布满皱纹，像是一块新犁过的田地一样沟壑交错；他上身肌肉发达，实实在在地立在两条长腿上；他双臂健壮有力，神态果断，看起来像是一个坚强、快乐、随和的人。

他不停地在轮船甲板上的人群中走来走去，从不停下来，如同水手们所说的，他在“走锚”，而且说话时手总是比画来比画去的，见到所有的人都很放肆，尤其老爱咬指甲。这是造物主一时心血来潮造出来，而又立即毁掉其模子的那些怪人中的一个。

除种种怪癖外，他还像莎士比亚一样，以一个“崇高的无知者”自诩，公开蔑视科学家。他说：“有些人只能在我们搞比赛时帮我们计计分而已。”总之，这是一个四处漂泊的波希米亚人，一个喜欢冒险而非冒险家的人，一个无比胆大的人，一个带着备用翅膀的伊卡洛斯[47]。反正，他敢于破釜沉舟，随时准备粉身碎骨，但最后总能安然无恙，如同孩子们爱玩的接骨木木偶一样。他的座右铭就几个字：“我有自己的看法！”对不可能的事的追求是他的“至爱”。

“亚特兰大”号上的这位乘客就是这样一个人，总是躁动不安，总是火急火燎，总是激动不已。这是因为他那燥热的体质使然。如果要找两个性格截然不同的人的话，那么非法国人米歇尔·阿尔当和美国人巴比凯恩莫属了。不过，这两个人却也有共同之处：执着、大胆、无所畏惧。

大炮俱乐部主席一直出神地凝视着这个让自己退居次要位置的对手；但很快，人群中爆发出的一阵阵欢呼声和喝彩声打断了他的沉思。一阵阵的呼喊声越来越疯狂，对米歇尔·阿尔当的个人崇拜，几乎达到了狂热的程度，以至这个法国人在与成千上万的人握过手之后，恨不得把自己的手指头奉献出去，好躲进自己的船舱。

巴比凯恩跟着他走，但一言未发。

“你就是巴比凯恩吧？”二人单独在一起时，米歇尔·阿尔当问对方道，那口气像是跟一个二十年的老朋友说话似的。

“是的。”大炮俱乐部主席回答道。

“嗯，你好，巴比凯恩。事情进展得怎么样呀？很好？那太好了！”

“这么说，”巴比凯恩直截了当地说道，“您真的决定出发了？”“真的决定了。”

“没有什么可以让您改变了？”

“没有什么了。你是否按照我电报上所指明的那样，对你的炮弹进行了改动？”

“我一直想等您来了之后再说，不过，”巴比凯恩又问了一句，“您真的考虑好了？”

“当然啰，难道我还有时间可耽误吗？我找到了去月球旅行的机会，我就得抓住它，就这么回事。我觉得这事用不着翻来覆去地考虑。”

巴比凯恩凝视着这个人；此人在谈到他的月球旅行时是那么轻描淡写，漫不经心，毫不畏惧。“可是，起码，”巴比凯恩对他说道，“您得有个计划，有一些实施方案吧？”

“当然有啊，亲爱的巴比凯恩。不过，请允许我向你指出一点：我喜欢一下子把自己的故事对所有的人讲完，然后就别再提了。这么做将可以避免一说再说。因此，如果你没有更好的意见的话，就请你把你的朋友们、同事们、全城的百姓们、全佛罗里达州的人们，以及——要是您愿意的话——全美国的人们，全都召集起来。明天我就可以把我的全部方案介绍一下，并且准备好应对各种各样的反对意见。请你放心，我是不怕反对意见的。你觉得怎样？”

“我觉得可以。”巴比凯恩回答道。

说完，巴比凯恩便走出了船舱，把米歇尔·阿尔当的意见告诉了大家。他的话受到了众人的欢迎，大家又跺脚又欢呼。这么一来，困难全都迎刃而解了。第二天，人人都可以随意地欣赏这位欧洲英雄了。但是，有些比较固执的群众仍然不愿离开“亚特兰大”号的甲板，他们准备留在船上过夜。其中包括J.T.马斯顿，他用他那铁钩钩住船艉栏杆，除非用绞盘，否则无法将它弄走。

“他是英雄！英雄！”他忽高忽低地不停地呼喊着，“与这个欧洲人相比，我们简直就是懦夫！”

至于巴比凯恩主席，在劝说众人离去之后，他又返回米歇尔·阿尔当的舱房，直到船上的钟在午夜敲响时，他才离去。

这两位深孚众望的对手热烈地握手，友好地道别了。





第十九章　大会


翌日，巴比凯恩担心有人会提出一些让米歇尔·阿尔当难以作答的问题，因此想把到场的人限制在很少的一部分专家中，比如说他的同事们。但是，这如同想筑上一道大堤坝以挡住尼亚加拉大瀑布一样困难。于是，他不得不放弃他的这一想法，只好让他的这位新朋友在一场公开演讲会上碰碰运气了。会场选的是城外的一处宽阔的原野。只几个钟头，原野上的阳光便被遮挡住了。港口停泊的船只上，船帆、索具、吊杆以及桅桁应有尽有，足以建起一个巨型帐篷。有三十万人待在帐篷里，不顾闷热难耐，一连好几个小时在等待着那个法国人的大驾光临。在这如云的与会者中，前面三分之一的人可以看见发言者和听见发言；中间三分之一的人勉强能够看见，但却听不见；而最后那三分之一的人则什么也看不见，更听不见，但他们同样在热烈鼓掌。下午三点，米歇尔·阿尔当在大炮俱乐部的主要成员的陪同下，步入会场。巴比凯恩主席挽着他的右臂，J.T.马斯顿挽着他的左臂，他显得神采奕奕，比正午的太阳还要光彩夺目。阿尔当登上讲台，眼睛向台下扫视了一番，只见黑压压一片帽子的海洋。

他看上去毫不紧张，毫不装模作样，像是在自己的家中一样，高高兴兴、无拘无束、和蔼可亲。面对听众们的热情欢呼，他优雅自然地回礼答谢。然后，他挥了挥手，让大家安静下来，开始用英语发言，十分得体地侃侃而谈。

“先生们，尽管天气炎热，我仍然想占用你们的一点儿宝贵时间，跟你们说说你们似乎感兴趣的一些计划。我既不是演说家，也不是科学家，我根本也未曾打算要在公开场合说上一番。但是，我的朋友巴比凯恩跟我说，我来说一说，你们会很高兴的，所以我就来了。因此，在场的三十万观众，用你们的六十万只耳朵听我说，如果我有什么说错了的地方，请予以谅解。首先，请你们不要忘记，站在你们面前的是一个无知的人；不过，他的无知却让他无视任何困难。他觉得，坐着炮弹飞向月球，是一件相当简单、自然、容易的事。月球旅行是迟早都将进行的事，至于应采用的交通方式，那就只能根据科学的进步规律来决定了。人类起先是手脚并用走路的；后来，有一天，就用两只脚直立行走了；接着又是四轮马车、公共马车；最后乘火车。好！我要告诉大家，炮弹就是我们未来的交通工具，其实，所有的行星也只不过是一些炮弹而已。先生们，你们中的有些人，可能以为赋予‘炮弹车’的速度太高了，其实并非如此；所有星球的运行速度都超过了它，而地球在围绕太阳运转的过程当中，其速度比它自转时要快三倍。更何况同其他行星相比，它只不过是在漫步，而且这个速度还变得越来越慢！不久的将来，它难道不会被其他一些速度更快的星体所超越吗？而那些速度更快的星体的电和光极有可能是它们的速度的原动力。”

“会的，亲爱的听众们，”他接着又说道，“按照某些目光短浅的人——这个形容词非常适合他们——的看法，人类将可能被局限在地球上，被囿于一个魔法圈里，永远别想钻出来。幸而事实并非如此！我们即将飞往月球，还将飞向其他行星，飞向恒星；如同我们今天从利物浦到纽约一样，方便、快速、安全，距离只是一个相对的概念，最终距离将归于零。”

全场的人虽然对这位法国英雄十分崇敬，激动万分，但是，对他的这个大胆的理论却不禁感到有点儿惊愕。米歇尔·阿尔当似乎也能理解这一点。

“先生们，”他又笑容可掬地接着说道，“你们好像并不信服。好吧！我们来推算一下。你们知道一列快速列车到达月球需要多长时间吗？三百天。不会超过三百天的！那么，这是个什么概念呢？这个距离甚至都不到地球周长的九倍，而任何一名水手或旅行者一生中所走过的路无不超过这一距离。所以，请诸位想一想，我飞往月球只不过需要九十七小时而已！啊！你们总是以为月球离地球非常遥远，非得考虑再三之后才能去冒这个险！可是，如果是去海王星呢，它可是在十一亿四千七百万法里外围绕太阳转的！喏！朋友们，如果拿海王星到太阳的距离与它同其他恒星的距离相比较，那么，它到太阳的距离简直不值一提了。说什么这个距离是存在的！错！大错特错！纯属谬论！你们知道我对这个以光芒四射的星球为起始，以海王星为结束的太阳系的看法吗？你们想不想知道我的理论？这个理论非常简单！在我看来，太阳系是一个均质的固体，组成它的那些行星拥挤在一起，互相贴近，彼此挨着，它们之间的距离小而又小，如同银、铁或铂这样一些大密度金属的分子间的间隙那么小！因此，我有理由认定，并且以将使你们大家心服口服的一种信心再次强调指出：‘距离是一个空泛的词，它根本就不存在！’”

“对！”J.T.马斯顿比其他任何人的嗓门儿都大地叫喊道，“距离并不存在！”可是，他由于动作太大，身体失去平衡，难以控制，差点儿便从台上摔到地上去了。不过，他还是站稳了，总算没有摔下去，否则这一摔将会向他证明，距离可能不是一个空泛的词。

“先生们，”米歇尔·阿尔当继续说道，“我重申一次，地球和月球之间的距离根本不值一提，不值得为此过分忧虑。我相信，不出二十年，地球上将会有一半的人访问月球！现在，尊敬的朋友们，如果你们有什么问题要问我的话，你们显然会让一个我这样的可怜人尴尬难堪的，但是，我将尽我所能地回答你们。”

直到这时为止，大炮俱乐部主席对讨论的情况都十分满意。但是，必须阻止米歇尔·阿尔当扯到实际问题上去，那肯定不是他的强项。因此，巴比凯恩连忙抢过话头，问他的这位新朋友是否认为月球或行星上有人居住。

“你这可是问了我一个很大的问题呀，我尊敬的主席。”演讲者笑吟吟地说道，“不过，如果我没弄错的话，一些才智过人的人，比如普鲁塔克、斯威登伯格、贝纳丹·德·圣比埃尔和其他许多人，都认为是有的。如果从自然哲学的观点去看待这个问题的话，我趋向于赞同他们的看法。我认为但凡这个世界上所存在的，就没有什么是无用的。不过，巴比凯恩朋友，如果通过另一个问题来回答你的问题的话，我冒昧地断言，如果所有星体都是可以居住的话，那么，它们现在就住着人，或者曾经住过人，或者将来会住人。”

“这个回答太符合逻辑了，太正确了！”大炮俱乐部主席回应道，“所以现在的问题应归结为：所有的星球是否都适合居住？以我个人来看，我认为是的。”

“我也对这一点深信无疑。”米歇尔·阿尔当回答道。

“但是，”听众中有一位反驳道，“有很多证据表明其他星球是不可以居住的。很显然，这些星球中的大部分的生存条件显然必须要大大改善。光就行星而言，由于距离太阳的远近不同，有些行星上的人就会被热死，而另一些行星上的人则会被冻死。”

“很遗憾，”米歇尔·阿尔当回答道，“我本人并不认识这位尊敬的反对者，否则我将尽量地回答他。我承认，他的意见有其意义；不过，我认为我可以成功地驳倒它，而且所有有关天体不具备可居住性的观点也都是可以驳倒的。如果我是自然哲学家的话，我就会说，假如紧邻太阳的行星运行中产生的卡路里少的话，那么，相反，远离太阳的行星在运行中所产生的卡路里就多。这种简单的现象就足以平衡热量，使得这些天体的温度变得能够适合像我们这样的有机生物承受。如果我是博物学家的话，我就会告诉他，根据一些杰出的科学家的观点，在地球上，大自然向我们提供了一些生活在不同条件下的动物的实例；告诉他鱼类可以在其他动物会窒息而死的条件下呼吸；两栖动物有着难以解释的双重的生存方式；海洋里的某些生物能够生活在很深的海底，而不被五六十个大气压压碎；各种各样的水生昆虫对温度并不敏感，既能在沸腾的热泉里生活，又能在北冰洋的冰原下生活；另外，必须承认，大自然存在着多种多样的生存方式，它们往往很难为我们所理解，但却是真实地存在着的。如果我是化学家，我就会告诉他说，陨石这种显然是在地球外形成的物体，通过分析研究，可以看到一些无可争辩的碳的痕迹，而这种物质只能来源于有机生物；而且，根据赖兴巴赫的试验来看，它一定是‘动物质化’了的物质。而如果我是神学家的话，我就会告诉他说，根据圣保罗的看法，神的救赎似乎不仅施于地球，还施于所有的宇宙天体。不过，我既不是神学家、化学家，也不是博物学家、哲学家，因此，我对于支配着宇宙的那些伟大的规律毫无所知，所以我只能回答说：‘我不知道这些天体上面是否住着人。’但是，正因为我不知道，我就更要去那上面看一看！”

反对米歇尔·阿尔当理论的那位是不是又提出了一些反对意见？这一点无法说清，因为人群在疯狂地喊叫，什么意见也听不清了。直到离讲台最远处的听众们也安静下来之后，得意扬扬的演讲者才又补充了几句：

“先生们，你们很清楚，关于这个大问题，我只是很粗浅地涉及了一点。尚有很多很多的论据表明，天体上是有人居住的。我暂且不谈这个问题。我只是请大家允许我坚持一点，对于那些坚持认为行星上无人居住的人，必须回答他们说：‘你们可能说得有道理，如果你们能证明地球是最佳星体的话；但是无论伏尔泰对此有何见解，却都并非如此。’‘地球只有一个卫星，而木星、天王星、土星、海王星却有好几个卫星围绕着它们，这个优势是绝不可小觑的。不过，让我们的地球变得不那么适于居住的最大原因是，它的地轴与轨道平面之间有一个交角，因此造成白昼和黑夜不一样长，季节的恼人变化也因此而产生。我们这个不幸的星球，不是太热就是太冷；冬天冻死人，夏天热死人。这是一个风湿病、咳嗽病和支气管炎多发的星球。而比如说木星就不然，它的轴的倾斜度很小[48]；它的居民们就可以享受四季如一的恒温；木星上也有四季分明的春天、夏天、秋天和冬天；每一位木星人都可以选择他所喜欢的气候，一生一世都不必忍受气候变化之苦。你们毫无疑问地会承认木星胜过我们地球的这一优势，更何况木星的一年相当于我们地球人的十二年！还有，我认为，在这些有利因素和极佳的生存条件之下，这个幸运星球上的居民们是一些高级生物。我们的星球还需要补充些什么才能达到这么完美的程度？只要地球自转轴与它的轨道平面间的交角不那么大就行了。’”

“那好！”一个洪亮的声音喊道，“那我们就团结我们的力量，发明一些机器，把地球自转轴矫正一些！”

这一建议引起了雷鸣般的掌声，而提此建议者并非别人，只能是J.T.马斯顿。如果他们知道了阿基米德寻找的支点之所在的话，这些美国佬想必就会制造一根能够撬起地球的杠杆，把地球的轴心撬正了。但是，那个支点，那些鲁莽的机械师还没有找到。





第二十章　攻击与反击


可是，当大家激动的情绪平复下来之后，只听见有一个严肃而洪亮的声音说道：

“现在，演说家已经长篇大论地介绍了他的幻想，他是否能回到他的主题上来，少谈点儿理论，多谈点儿他的月球之行的实际部分呀？”

众人的目光一下子转向了说话的那个人。此人干瘪瘦削，精力充沛，下巴上蓄着一丛美国式山羊胡子。由于会场上出现过几次骚动，他得以逐渐地挤到第一排来了。他站在那儿，双臂交叉，目光炯炯有神，犀利、严肃，死死地凝视着大会的主角。他提完问题之后便沉默不语，对集中到他身上来的数千道目光以及被他的话激起的不满的嘟哝声似乎无动于衷。由于没有听到演讲者的回答，他又重复了一遍自己所提的问题，和刚才一样清晰而明确，然后，他又补充道：“我们来这儿讨论的是月球而不是地球。”

“您说得对，先生，”米歇尔·阿尔当回答道，“讨论是离题了。我们还是回到月球的问题上来吧。”

“先生，”那个陌生人又说道，“您声称我们的卫星上有人居住。很好，但是，如果有月球人存在的话，那些人肯定是不用呼吸便能生存的人，因为——我提请您注意——月球表面连一个空气分子都没有。”

阿尔当闻听此言，不禁连狮鬣都竖了起来；他意识到来者不善，与他必有一争。他也定睛注视着此人，说道：

“啊！月球上没有空气！请问，这是谁下的结论？”

“科学家们。”

“是吗？”

“就是。”

“先生，”米歇尔·阿尔当又说道，“我并非说假话，我真的是深深地敬重有真才实学的科学家的；不过，我对那些无知的科学家是鄙夷不屑的。”

“您了解属于后一种的科学家吗？”

“特别了解。在法国，有这么一位科学家声称，精确来讲，鸟儿‘肯定’不会飞；而另有一位用理论指出，鱼其实在水里是活不了的。”

“先生，我说的不是这种人，而我可以举出几个您无法反对的名字，以证实我的观点是正确的。”

“先生，您这可是让我这么个可怜的无知者大为尴尬了；不过，我倒是觉得能够得到您的指教，真的是求之不得。”

“您既然没有研究过科学问题，那您为什么要讨论它们呢？”陌生人粗暴地诘问道。

“为什么！”阿尔当回答道，“因为我始终是个勇敢者，不畏任何艰难险阻！我是一无所知，但恰恰是我的弱点给予了我力量。”

“您的弱点发展到了疯狂的程度！”陌生人气呼呼地大声说道。

“呃，好极了！”法国人反驳道，“如果我的疯狂能把我带到月球上去的话，那可再好也没有了！”

巴比凯恩及其同事们眼睛死死地盯着这个如此大胆地跑来对试验从中作梗的不速之客，恨不得吃了他。谁也不认识他，而巴比凯恩主席对这么激烈的论战的后果十分担心，因此，他不免忧心忡忡地看着自己的那位新朋友。与会者们全都全神贯注而且真的非常焦虑不安，因为这场论战的后果有可能把全场人的注意力吸引到月球旅行的危险性上来，或者吸引到这一试验的不可能性上来。

“先生，”米歇尔·阿尔当的对手又说道，“理由很多很多，而且无可争议，它们证明了月球周围没有一点儿空气。我甚至可以凭借先验说，就算这种空气曾经存在过，也该被地球吸光了。不过，我仍然更想用无可辩驳的事实来驳斥您。”

“您就驳斥好了，先生，您想怎么驳斥就怎么驳斥吧！”

“您知道，”陌生人说道，“当光线穿过一种像空气这样的介质的时候，它们就会偏离直线；或者换句话说，它们发生了折射。好！当星星被月亮遮挡住，在它们的光线擦过月亮边缘的时候，却毫无偏离，也无丝毫折射现象。因此，可以得出明显的结论：月球并未被大气包围。”

“实际上，”米歇尔·阿尔当回答道，“这也许并非您唯一的论据，但至少是您最有力的论据了。也许一个科学家对此难以作答，但是，我嘛，我只想告诉您，您的这一论据是有缺陷的。因为它是以假设月球的角直径完全确定为前提的，但实际情况并非如此。不过，我们暂且不谈这个问题。我只想请您告诉我，亲爱的先生，您是否承认月球表面有火山存在。”

“是的，是有一些死火山，但活火山却没有。”

“不过，这也就是说，这些死火山在某一段时期内曾经是很活跃的？”

“这是肯定的；但是，由于火山本身可以自供它燃烧所需的氧气，因此，它们的爆发根本就不能证明月球上有大气存在。”

“那好，先别讨论这一问题，我们还是说说直接的看法吧。一七一五年，卢维尔和哈雷两位天文学家在观测五月三日的月食时，发现有某些十分怪异的雷电。他们认为，那些转瞬即逝的并往往会重复出现的闪光，是月球大气层里所产生的暴风雨导致的。”

“一七一五年，”那个陌生人反驳道，“天文学家卢维尔和哈雷是把纯属地球的现象误以为是月球现象了，比如产生于地球大气层里的流星或其他一些现象。科学家们当时对他们的这种发现就是这么回答的，我今天的回答也同他们的一样。”

“这个问题咱们也先搁在一边，”阿尔当并未被对方问倒，镇定地回答道，“一七八七年，赫歇尔不是观测到月球表面有大量的光点吗？”

“是呀，不过，赫歇尔并未阐释这些光点的来源，他本人并没有下结论说它们的出现是因为月球有大气层的缘故。我要补充一句，对月球这个黑夜星球很有研究的两位权威人士比尔先生和默雷德先生都认为月球表面绝对没有空气。”

人群中出现了一阵骚动，他们似乎被这个陌生人的论据打动了。

“这个问题也先搁在一边吧，”米歇尔·阿尔当从容而冷静地回答道，“咱们现在先来谈谈一个重要事实。一位名叫洛斯达的杰出的法国天文学家，在观测一八六〇年七月十八日的日食时发现，月牙形的太阳的两边的角呈圆形，被切去了两个尖角。而这一现象的出现，只能是太阳光穿过月球大气层时发生折射而产生的，不可能有其他的解释。”

“但这件事确实无误吗？”陌生人急切地问道。

“确实无误！”

人群又一次出现骚动，不过，这次的骚动是在为大家所爱戴的英雄而激动，而他的对手此刻却一言不发。阿尔当并未因一时的得胜而忘乎所以，他只是说道：

“您很清楚，亲爱的先生，话不能说得太绝对，不能硬说月球表面不存在大气层。这个大气层可能并不很厚，空气很稀薄，但是，当今的科学界一般还是承认它的存在的。”

“您也别不高兴，我还是要说，起码高山上没有空气。”陌生人仍固执己见地反驳道。

“对，不过在山谷深处有，而且不超过几百英尺的厚度。”

“不管怎么说，您得小心谨慎，因为那儿的空气极其稀薄。”

“我的好先生，反正足够一个人呼吸的了。再说，一旦到了那上面，我会尽量节省空气的，只有在重大的场合我才呼吸！”

此言一出，立刻引起听众们的一阵巨大的哄笑声，敲击着神秘的陌生人的耳朵，但他仍趾高气扬地环视会场，表情鄙夷不屑。

“因此，”米歇尔·阿尔当神情轻松地接着说道，“既然我们都认为那儿是有一定的空气存在着的，那我们就不得不承认那儿也有一定数量的水存在着。我对这么一个结论感到高兴。另外，我可爱的反对者，请允许我再向您指出一点。我们只了解月球的一面，如果它面向我们的那一面只有极少量的空气的话，那背对我们的那一面就可能有大量的空气。”

“那是为什么呀？”

“因为月球在地球引力作用之下呈鸡蛋形，我们只能从它小的那一头看到它。因此，汉森的测算得出了如此的结果：月球的重心位于它的另一半球。所以我们可以得出结论：自月球形成初期，所有的空气和水都被吸引到它的另一面去了。”

“无稽之谈！”陌生人叫嚷道。

“非也！这纯粹是建立在力学定律基础上的理论，我觉得这是很难推翻的。因此，我呼吁本次大会，对在地球上生存的生物能否在月球上生存的问题进行表决。”

三十万听众一起鼓掌欢迎这一提议。米歇尔·阿尔当的那位反对者仍想说点儿什么，但是大家根本不可能听得见，因为喊叫声、威胁声像冰雹似的一阵阵地向他袭来。

“够了！够了！”有些人在喊叫。

“把这个私自闯入者驱逐出去！”另有一些人呼叫道。

“赶出去！赶出去！”愤怒的群众齐声高喊。

可是，陌生人仍岿然不动地站在台前，神色坚定，任凭雷鸣般的叫骂声此起彼伏。幸亏米歇尔·阿尔当连忙挥手制止，否则这场暴风雨将越刮越猛。米歇尔·阿尔当非常讲究骑士风度，不想丢下他的反对者不管。

“您还想说几句吗？”他语气十分亲切地问他的反对者。

“是的，还要说一百句，一千句！您要是坚持您的试验的话，您就必须准备好——”

“信口雌黄！您怎么能这样对待我？我只是向我的朋友巴比凯恩提议制造一种圆锥形炮弹，以便一路上不会像笼子里的松鼠似的打转。”

“但是，可怜的人呀，炮弹发射时的强大的后坐力会把您击得粉碎的！”

“我亲爱的反对者，您这才是点到真正的又是唯一的难题了。不过，我对美国人的创造才能非常有好感，所以我相信他们一定会解决这一难题的！”

“可是，炮弹穿过大气层时，由于高速而产生的高温问题怎么解决？”

“噢！炮弹壁很厚，而且穿越大气层又只是瞬间的事！”

“那么食物呢？水呢？”

“我算过了，我可以带上一年所需的水和食物，而我飞向月球只需四天工夫！”

“沿途所要呼吸的空气呢？”

“我会用化学方法解决的。”

“那您若真的到达月球的话，如何降落呢？”

“那只有在地球上降落的速度的六分之一，因为在月球表面，重力是地球上的六分之一。”

“即便如此，那也会像摔玻璃器皿似的把您摔得粉碎的！”

“到时候，我难道不会使用装配合适的火药并及时点火的火箭来减缓下降速度吗？”

“好吧，就算您把这些难题全都解决了，把所有的障碍都清除了，让所有的好运全都集中到您的身上了，您可以安然无恙地到达月球上了，可是，您又怎么返回来呢？”

“我不返回来了！”

闻听这句简洁而豪迈的话语，全场的人顿时一言不发了。不过，此时无声胜有声，比激动万分的欢呼更具有说服力。陌生人趁机最后一次发表自己的反对意见。

“您肯定必死无疑！”陌生人大声说道，“而您的死只不过是一个疯子的死亡，对科学毫无意义！”

“说下去，好心的陌生朋友，因为您的预言方式真的很讨人喜欢。”

“啊！您太过分了！”米歇尔·阿尔当的反对者大声嚷道，“我不明白为什么我要继续进行这么不严肃的讨论！您随心所欲地继续您的疯狂试验吧！应该谴责的倒并不是您！”

“噢！请尽管直说！”

“是的！对您的行动负责的应该另有其人！”

“请问那是谁呢？”米歇尔·阿尔当严厉地问道。

“是那个组织这个既荒谬又滑稽的试验的无知者。”

攻击是直言不讳的。自从陌生人介入以来，巴比凯恩在竭尽全力克制自己，拼命地压住直往上冒的怒火；但是，见自己被如此肆无忌惮地攻击，他再也受不了了。他腾地一下站了起来，冲着敢于放肆地向他挑战的对手径直走了过去，可是他突然发现自己被隔了开来。

原来搭建的讲台一下子被上百只强壮的胳膊举了起来，大炮俱乐部主席和米歇尔·阿尔当分享了胜利的荣耀。讲台非常沉重，抬的人在不停地轮流替换，人人都争先恐后，互不相让，都想抬一抬，以表示自己的支持。

陌生人并未趁乱离开会场。再说，人群那么密集，他能出得去吗？肯定不能。总之，他仍然待在第一排，抱着双臂，眼睛死死地盯着巴比凯恩主席。

在胜利的巡游过程中，人群的欢呼声达到了顶点。米歇尔·阿尔当满脸愉悦地接受着群众的热情欢呼。他容光焕发，精神抖擞。有几次，被众人抬着的讲台前后颠簸，左右摇摆，仿佛一条被浪涛折腾着的小船。但是，大会的这两位英雄却站得稳稳当当，岿然不动；于是，他们的这条“小船”便安然无恙地“驶”入坦帕城的港口。

米歇尔·阿尔当最后幸运地躲过了他的那些热情洋溢的崇拜者的拥抱，逃进富兰克林旅馆，快步进到自己的房间，迅速躺到床上，而一支十万人的群众大军却苦苦地守候在他的窗下。

在这段时间里，那个神秘人物与大炮俱乐部主席之间出现了一个短暂的、严肃的、具有决定性意义的场面。

终于得以脱身的巴比凯恩径直走向他的对手。

“跟我来！”他简短地说。

那人跟着他在码头上走着，不一会儿二人便单独来到朝向琼斯瀑布的一个码头的入口处。

这两个彼此尚不认识的敌人在那儿对视着。

“您到底是谁？”巴比凯恩问道。

“尼科尔船长。”

“我就猜到是您。此前，您一直没有机会来挡我的道。”

“我已经到您的这条道上来了！”

“您侮辱了我！”

“而且还是在大庭广众之下。”

“您得给我说清楚为什么要侮辱我。”

“我现在就说。”

“不。我希望一切都只在我俩之间私下里进行。离坦帕城三英里处有一片树林，名叫斯克思诺树林。您知道这地方吗？”

“知道。”

“明天清晨五点，您能否从树林的一边进去？”

“可以，如果您在同一时间从另一边进去的话。”

“您到时不会忘记带上您的来复枪吧？”巴比凯恩说。

“您不忘我也不会忘的。”尼科尔回答道。

大炮俱乐部主席冷冰冰地说完这句话之后，便同尼科尔船长各自离去了。巴比凯恩回到自己的住处，未顾得上在约会前所剩下的几个小时里休息一下，便熬夜研究避免炮弹后坐力的方法，来解决米歇尔·阿尔当在大会上提出的这个难题。





第二十一章　一个法国人是如何摆平一件事的


当大炮俱乐部主席巴比凯恩与尼科尔船长在讨论决斗事宜——这是一场可怕、野蛮的决斗，双方都想置对手于死地——的时候，米歇尔·阿尔当却在休息，以消除胜利所造成的疲劳。但很显然，“休息”一词用得很不恰当，因为美国人的床铺硬得可以同大理石桌或花岗岩桌相媲美了。

因此，阿尔当睡得很不踏实。他裹着毛巾被，在床上辗转反侧，难以入眠，他在考虑如何才能在炮弹里放置一张软和舒适的床垫。正在这时候，一阵嘈杂声把他从睡梦中惊醒过来。他的房门被敲得乱响，仿佛被铁锤锤击一般。一大清早，能分辨得出在这片嘈杂声中有大声说话声。“开门！”有人在喊，“天哪，快开门哪！”阿尔当完全可以对这种粗暴的要求置之不理，但是，他还是起身去开门了。这时，房门几乎要被顽固的来访者撞开了。大炮俱乐部秘书冲进房来，简直比一颗炮弹肆无忌惮地射了进来的动静还大。

“昨天晚上，”J.T.马斯顿冲进来直嚷嚷道，“我们主席在大会上被公开侮辱了！他向他的对手下了战书，那家伙并非别人，就是尼科尔船长！他俩今早要去斯克思诺树林一决雌雄！这一切都是巴比凯恩亲口对我说的！如果巴比凯恩被杀了，那我们的计划就全都泡汤了！所以必须阻止这场决斗！但这世上只有一个人有能力阻止巴比凯恩，而这个人就是您，米歇尔·阿尔当！”

J. T.马斯顿在这么说时，米歇尔·阿尔当并不想打断他，只是急匆匆地套上他那条肥大的裤子。不到两分钟工夫，他便同来者一起拼命地向坦帕城郊跑去。

马斯顿边奔跑边将情况告诉了阿尔当。阿尔当这才知道巴比凯恩和尼科尔互相仇恨的真正原因，知道二人的积怨由来已久；而且，多亏了双方共同的朋友们的帮助，二人在这之前才从未碰到一起。马斯顿还告诉阿尔当，唯一的根源是钢板与炮弹之争，而大会上的那一幕只不过是尼科尔长期以来寻找的发泄积怨的一次机会罢了。

没有什么比这类美国式的一对一的决斗更可怕的了，因为决斗双方在树丛中相互寻觅，躲在荆棘丛中彼此窥视，在灌木丛中像野兽似的互相对射。在这种时刻，他们中每一个人大概都会羡慕大草原上印第安人那天生的超人本领——他们的机智敏捷，他们的聪明狡猾，以及发现敌人的敏锐嗅觉。一个失误，一丝犹豫，走错一步，都可能导致死亡。在这种决斗之中，美国佬往往会带上自己的狗，他们既是猎人又是猎物，数小时不停地追逐着。

“你们真是一群魔鬼！”听了同伴绘声绘色的描述之后，米歇尔·阿尔当大声嚷道。

“我们就是这样的人，”J.T.马斯顿谦逊地说，“不过，我们还是跑快点儿吧。”

然而，尽管米歇尔·阿尔当和J.T.马斯顿二人飞奔过被露水打湿了的平原，越过稻田和小溪，专拣近道走，他们还是无法在五点半之前赶到斯克思诺树林。巴比凯恩大概半个小时之前就已经进入树林里了。

树林边有一个老樵夫正在忙着锯断他用斧头砍倒的一棵树。

马斯顿跑过去，冲他喊道：“您看没看见一个背着步枪的人进到树林里去？他叫巴比凯恩……主席……我最好的朋友……”

大炮俱乐部的这位可敬的秘书天真地认为，全世界的人都认识他的主席。但是，那樵夫好像没有听明白他在说什么。

“一个猎人。”阿尔当插了一句。

“一个猎人？有一个。”樵夫回答道。

“进去多久了？”

“大概有一小时了吧。”

“太迟了！”马斯顿叫嚷道。

“那您听见枪声了吗？”阿尔当问道。

“没有。”

“一声也没有？”

“一声也没有。那个猎人好像没什么收获！”

“怎么办呀？”马斯顿问。

“进树林里去，哪怕冒着被一颗不是针对我们的流弹击中的危险。”

“啊！”马斯顿以明确无误的声音坚定地说道，“我宁愿被二十颗子弹击中脑袋，也不愿看到一颗子弹射中巴比凯恩的脑袋。”

“进树林吧！”阿尔当握紧同伴的手说道。

几秒钟之后，二人便消失在树丛中了。这个灌木林非常茂密，长满了高大的柏树、假挪威槭树、鹅掌楸、橄榄树、罗望子树、橡树和木兰树。各种各样的树木枝叶交错，缠绕在一起，遮挡住视线，使人无法看到远处。米歇尔·阿尔当和马斯顿一前一后地紧跟着往前走，静默地穿过深草丛，在粗壮的藤条中砍出一条道来，目光在灌木丛中搜寻着，每走一步都担心会听到可怕的枪声。至于巴比凯恩穿过树林时留下的足迹，他们根本就辨认不出来，他俩只是盲目地在那些模糊不清的小径上往前走着。只有印第安人才可能在这种路径上一步一步地追踪自己的敌人。

徒劳地寻找了一个小时之后，二人停了下来。他俩心中更加焦急不安了。

“人肯定是完了，”马斯顿丧气地说，“像巴比凯恩这样的人是不会同敌人耍花招的，既不会设陷阱，又不会使诡计！他太老实，太大胆了。他勇往直前，直冲危险奔去；那樵夫想必离得太远，所以才没有听见枪声！”

“可我们呢！我们呢！”米歇尔·阿尔当反驳道，“自我们进到树林里之后，我们本该听见的呀！”

“可能我们来得太迟了！”马斯顿绝望地喊叫道。

阿尔当不知如何回答才好，他和马斯顿又继续沉默着不停地往前走。他俩不时地呼唤着，一会儿叫巴比凯恩，一会儿叫尼科尔；但是那两个互相仇恨的对手都没有回应。一些愉快地飞翔着的鸟儿，被他们的叫喊声惊着了，消失在树枝间，而几只受惊的小鹿则慌忙逃进树丛中去了。

他们又继续寻找了一个钟头。大部分的树林都被他们找遍了，就是不见两个决斗者的踪影。他们开始怀疑那个樵夫是不是没有说真话。阿尔当有点儿不耐烦了，不想继续进行这种长时间的无谓的寻找了。但正在这时，马斯顿突然停下了脚步。

“嘘，”马斯顿嘘了一声，说，“那边有人！”

“有人？”米歇尔·阿尔当回应道。

“是的！一个男人！他好像一动不动。他手里也没有枪了。他在干什么呢？”

“您认出他是谁了吗？”米歇尔·阿尔当眼睛近视，在这种情况之下看不清楚谁是谁，便这么问道。

“认出来了！认出来了！他正要转过身来。”马斯顿回答道。

“他是……”

“尼科尔船长！”

“尼科尔！”米歇尔·阿尔当的心立刻揪了起来，大声嚷道。

“尼科尔没了武器！他难道不用再害怕他的对手了？”

“我们走到他面前去，”米歇尔·阿尔当说道，“看看究竟是怎么回事。”

他俩还没走到五十步便停了下来，更加小心谨慎地观察船长。他们原以为会发现一个嗜血如命、复仇心切的人！

可是，仔细一看，二人怔住了。

两棵高大的鹅掌楸之间张着一个网眼很密的捕鸟网，网里有一只小鸟，翅膀被网眼缠住了，拼命地挣扎着，发出一声声凄惨的哀鸣。设置这么异常复杂的网的不是人类，而是当地特有的一种毒蜘蛛，其脑袋大若鸽蛋，长有锋利的螫牙。这种丑恶的动物在扑向它的猎物时，却偏偏转过身来，躲到鹅掌楸的高大枝丫中去了，因为一个可怕的敌人正在威胁着它的生命。

原来，尼科尔船长把枪放在了地上，忘了自己已经身处险境，只是一心一意地、尽可能小心谨慎地去解救那只落在可怕的蛛网中的小鸟。他终于把小鸟从蛛网中解救了下来，把它放飞了。小鸟快乐地扑扇着翅膀，飞走了。

尼科尔怜爱地望着小鸟穿过树枝。正在这时，他听见有人在激动地喊着：

“您真是一个勇敢的人哪！”

尼科尔闻声立刻转过头来。米歇尔·阿尔当站在他的面前，非常激动地又说了一句：

“您是一个善良的人！”

“米歇尔·阿尔当！”尼科尔船长叫道，“您怎么跑到这儿来了？”

“我是来问候您的，尼科尔，并且要阻止您杀害巴比凯恩或者阻止您被他杀死。”

“巴比凯恩！”船长大声嚷道，“我都找了他两个钟头了，也没找到他！他藏到哪儿去了？”

“尼科尔，”米歇尔·阿尔当说，“您这么说可不太礼貌啊！我们应该始终尊重自己的对手。您放心好了，只要巴比凯恩还活着，我们就一定能找到他的，而且很容易就能找到他，如果他不像您那么兴致勃勃地去解救受困的鸟儿的话，他大概也在找您呢。不过，等我们找到他的时候，我米歇尔·阿尔当可要告诉您，你们俩不许再决斗了。”

“我同巴比凯恩主席之间，”尼科尔严肃地回答道，“不共戴天，你死我活，互不相容……”

“得了吧！得了吧！”阿尔当又说道，“像你们这样的人，曾经互不相容，现在应该一笑泯恩仇。你们不要再决斗了。”

“我必须决斗，先生！”

“绝对不行！”

“船长，”J.T.马斯顿诚恳而贴心地说道，“我是主席的朋友，相交甚笃，不分彼此。如果您非要杀谁的话，那就冲我开枪吧，反正都是一回事。”

“先生，”尼科尔紧攥着枪说，“这种玩笑……”

“我们的朋友马斯顿没在开玩笑，”阿尔当回答道，“我完全理解他宁愿替自己敬爱的人去死的想法！不过，无论是他还是巴比凯恩，都不会倒在尼科尔船长的枪下，因为我对你们二位敌对者有一个很诱人的建议，你们一定会迫不及待地接受它的。”

“什么建议？”尼科尔显然不相信地问道。

“您先别急，”阿尔当回答道，“我得等巴比凯恩也在场时才能说。”

“那咱们就去找他吧！”船长大声说道。

三个人立即上路。船长把枪里的子弹退了膛之后，把枪背在肩上，二话没说便迈开大步向前走去。

又过了半个小时，搜寻仍毫无结果。马斯顿有种不祥的预感。他神情凝重地看着尼科尔，心想尼科尔的报复是否已经得逞了，可怜的巴比凯恩是不是已经挨了一枪，鲜血淋漓地躺在灌木丛深处，早已气绝身亡了。阿尔当似乎也同马斯顿一样作如是想，二人一直在用探询的目光盯着尼科尔船长。突然间，马斯顿停下了脚步。

只见一个人背靠着一棵二十英尺高的美洲梓树，上半身一动不动，下半身隐没在深草丛中。

“是他！”马斯顿喊道。

巴比凯恩没有动弹。阿尔当目光紧盯着船长的眼睛，可尼科尔并无异常反应。阿尔当边喊边往前走了几步：

“巴比凯恩！巴比凯恩！”

没有什么回应。阿尔当向他的朋友奔过去；但是，正当他要去抓后者的胳膊时，却惊愕地大叫一声，突然停下了。

巴比凯恩手里拿着铅笔，正在一个本子上画着一些几何图形，而他的那支退了膛的步枪却扔在地上。

这位科学家早已把决斗和复仇忘到脑后，一门心思地思考着自己的工作，什么也没看见，什么也没听见。

当阿尔当用手去摸巴比凯恩的手时，他立刻抬起头来，用惊诧的目光看着对方。

“啊！”巴比凯恩终于大声嚷道，“原来是你呀！我找到了，我的朋友！我找到了！”

“找到什么了？”

“我的方法！”

“什么方法？”

“就是消除炮弹发射时的后坐力的方法呀！”

“真的吗？”米歇尔·阿尔当边说边用余光瞄了船长一眼。

“真的！用水！用普通的水，就能……就能起到弹性作用……啊！马斯顿！”巴比凯思叫嚷道，“您也在呀！”

“是呀，他也在，”阿尔当回答道，“同时，请允许我向你介绍一下尊敬的尼科尔船长！”

“尼科尔！”巴比凯恩腾地站起身来大声说道，“对不起，船长，我刚才忘了决斗的事情了……我现在准备好了！”

米歇尔·阿尔当没容这两个敌人彼此叫板，立即插言道：

“好啊！”他说，“幸亏像你们俩这样正直的人刚才没有碰到一起！否则我们现在就得为你们中的一位哭泣了。多亏上帝进行了干预，现在用不着再担惊受怕了。一个人能忘掉仇恨，专心研究力学问题或者制服蜘蛛，那么，这种仇恨就不是那般骇人。”

于是，米歇尔·阿尔当便把船长大战毒蜘蛛的故事讲给巴比凯恩主席听了。

“我倒是想问你们一下，”他最后说道，“像你们二位这样的好人，难道生来就是为了用枪击碎彼此脑袋的吗？”

在这种有点儿滑稽可笑的情境之下，出现了某种极其出人意料的东西，以至巴比凯恩和尼科尔都不太知道该如何对待对方。这一点米歇尔·阿尔当明显地感受到了，因此他决定抓紧时机让二人握手言欢。

“我善良的朋友们，”他的嘴角浮现出迷人的微笑，说道，“你们二位之间只不过出现了一点儿小小的误会而已，并没有别的什么事。喏！为了表明你们之间一切积怨全都消除了，而且你们也都是敢于冒生命危险的人，所以请坦率地接受我要向你们提出的建议吧。”

“您说吧。”尼科尔说道。

“巴比凯恩朋友认为他的炮弹将径直飞向月球。”

“正是，肯定如此。”巴比凯恩应答道。

“而尼科尔朋友则坚信它将掉在地球上。”

“我对此深信不疑。”船长大声说道。

“那好！”阿尔当接着说道，“我无意让你们二位看法一致，我只想告诉你们：跟我一起飞往月球，去看看我们是否会停在半道上。”

“什么？”J.T.马斯顿惊愕不已，叫嚷道。

两位敌对者闻听这个突然的建议，不禁彼此凝视着。巴比凯恩在等待船长的回答，而尼科尔则等着巴比凯恩主席的回应。

“怎么样？”米歇尔问道，“反正也不用担心后坐力的问题！”

“同意！”巴比凯恩大声喊道。

巴比凯恩虽然回答得极快，但尼科尔也未落后半秒。

“好啊！太好了！哈！哈！”米歇尔边大声欢呼边向两位对手伸出手去，“现在问题已经解决了，朋友们，请允许我以法国的方式来招呼你们。咱们吃饭去吧！”





第二十二章　美国新公民


那一天，全美国都获知了尼科尔船长和巴比凯恩主席之间发生的事情及奇特的结局。自那一日起，米歇尔·阿尔当便得不到片刻的休息了。一批又一批来自美利坚合众国各地的代表团没完没了地缠着他。他只好硬着头皮接待他们。他不停地与人握手，不停地与人寒暄，很快就累得要散架了。但他却知道如何管住自己，使自己保持在一种令人愉快的半醉状态之中。

在缠着米歇尔·阿尔当的各色代表团中，有一个“受月亮影响者”[49]代表团，他们没有忘记对这位未来的月球征服者应该做的是什么。有一天，这些在美国为数不少的可怜人中的一些人前来找他，要求同他一起回到自己的故乡——月球——上去。

“真是怪病缠身！”米歇尔·阿尔当向他们承诺会给他们在月球上的朋友捎口信才把他们打发走了之后，对巴比凯恩说道，“你不相信月球对疾病有影响吧？”

“一点儿不信！”

“我也不相信，不过，历史上记载过一些至少是很令人惊讶的事情。比如，一六九三年，在一次传染病猖獗之时，死人死得最多的是一月二十一日的一次月食的时候。大名鼎鼎的培根每到月食时便会昏厥。国王查理六世在一三九九年一年中，癫痫病发作了六次，在新月或满月的时候都发作过。有一些医生将癫痫病归入那些受月相影响的疾病之列。事实上，通过对发烧、梦游和其他人类疾病等病例进行的观察，似乎都证明月球对地球上的疾病有着一种神秘的影响。”

“那它是怎么影响的？为什么会影响呢？”巴比凯恩问道。

“为什么？我的回答同阿拉戈的完全一样。他曾借用十九个世纪以前普鲁塔克说的那句话：‘也许这并非真有其事吧！’”

在成功之时，米歇尔·阿尔当逃不过一个名人不得不应付的任何一项苦差事。成功的工厂主们想拿他当招牌。巴纳姆想向他提供一百万，要他跑遍美国的一座又一座城市，把他当作珍稀动物似的巡回展览。他的照片，各种尺寸、造型应有尽有；转眼间，便卖出五百多万张。

崇拜他的不单单是男人们，女人们亦然。要是他心血来潮想“成家立业”，那就会有无数的“美满姻缘”在等着他！尤其是那些苦等了四十来年不见美好婚姻的老姑娘，更是没日没夜地看着他的照片想入非非。可以肯定，即使他定下必须跟他一起飞向太空这样的条件，也会有成百上千的女子愿意做他的妻子的。但是，他可并没有到月球上去传宗接代的打算，也不想把法国和美国的混血儿留在那儿。

所以，凡求婚者，他一概拒绝。

当他总算摆脱了那些令人尴尬的庆功会的时候，他就在他的朋友们的陪伴之下，前去参观哥伦比亚大炮。他参观哥伦比亚大炮时，对它赞不绝口，而且还下到很快就要把他发射到月球上的这门巨炮的底部。

在此，必须回述一下J.T.马斯顿的一个相关建议。当大炮俱乐部秘书听见巴比凯恩和尼科尔接受了米歇尔·阿尔当的提议时，他便决定与他们合伙，来个“四人结伴游”。因此，有一天，他便提出了自己的这一要求。但是，巴比凯恩显得很为难地拒绝了他，明确告诉他炮弹载不了这么多人。J.T.马斯顿非常沮丧，便跑去找米歇尔·阿尔当。阿尔当就劝他还是别去了，并且说出了几条很有说服力的理由。

“你知道的，老伙计，”他说道，“你可千万别误解我的意思；不过，说实在的，咱俩说句掏心窝的话，你不是个身体完整的人了，到月球上去是很不合适的！”

“身体不完整？”勇敢的残疾人大声嚷叫道。

“正是！我亲爱的朋友！你想一想，万一我们在那上面碰到月球居民的话，你希望给他们留下一个对我们地球非常糟糕的印象吗？让他们知道什么叫战争，告诉他们我们把最美好的时光用来互相厮杀，你吞我，我吃你，彼此被弄得缺胳膊少腿的？让他们知道这就是本可以养活上千亿人，现如今只能养活十二亿人的地球？我看你还是算了吧，我尊贵的朋友，否则你会让我们大家都被赶出月球的！”

“可是，如果你们到达月球时被摔得粉身碎骨了，不也同我一样不完整了吗？”

“那当然喽，”米歇尔·阿尔当回答道，“但是，我们会安然无恙，不会粉身碎骨的！”

的确，十月十八日进行了一次预射，结果十分理想，让人满怀着充分的理由相信试验会成功的希望。当时，巴比凯恩想要了解一下炮弹发射的后坐力有多大，便从彭萨科拉军工厂弄了一门口径三十二英寸的迫击炮。它被架设在希尔斯伯勒湾的岸边上，好使炮弹落在海里，减少它落下时的撞击力。其目的只在于试验一下炮弹发射时的震动，而不是测试它落下时的撞击力度。

为了这个新奇的试验，他们精心地准备了一颗空心炮弹。在用最优质的钢材制成的弹簧网上包上了一层厚厚的护垫，使得弹壁受到双层保护。经过这么一弄，炮弹简直像是一个精心构建的鸟巢。

“无法坐进去真叫人好不遗憾啊！”J.T.马斯顿因自己的身体问题无法参与试验而感慨地说道。

在这颗由螺钉拧紧盖子的可爱的炮弹里，先放进去一只大肥猫，然后又放进去一只属于大炮俱乐部常任秘书的小松鼠。尽管这只小松鼠是J.T.马斯顿的最爱，但是大家都想弄明白这个不怕眩晕的小家伙是怎样承受这场试验的。

迫击炮里装上了一百六十磅的火药，炮弹塞进了炮膛，点火了。炮弹立即飞升，在空中清晰地画了一道雄伟的抛物线，上升到大约一千英尺的高度，然后又画出一道优美的弧线，落入波涛汹涌的海水中。

一只小船立即向着炮弹落下的地点飞快地划过去。几位本领高强的潜水员立即跳入水中，用缆绳拦腰捆住炮弹，极快地将它弄上了小船。从两只小动物被装进炮弹到把它们的“牢房”门打开，还不到五分钟。

阿尔当、巴比凯恩、马斯顿、尼科尔都坐在小船上，他们怀着一种不难理解的心情认真观看了这次试验。炮弹门刚一打开，那只猫便立即蹿了出来，它只有一点儿轻微的擦伤，仍旧活蹦乱跳的，不像是经历了一场空中远行归来的样子。但是，却没有看见小松鼠。不得不承认现实了：是猫把它的旅伴给吃了。

J. T.马斯顿失去了他那只可怜的小松鼠，感到无比难过，决定把它记录在科学殉难者的名录之中。

不管怎么说，反正经过这次试验之后，所有的疑虑、担忧全都烟消云散了。再说，根据巴比凯恩的计划，炮弹还将进行改进、完善，后坐力将几乎全部消除。

两天之后，米歇尔·阿尔当收到美利坚合众国总统的一封短笺。获此殊荣，他非常激动。

美国政府参照米歇尔·阿尔当的有着骑士风度的同胞拉斐特侯爵的例子，授予他“美利坚合众国公民”的称号。





第二十三章　炮弹车厢


著名的哥伦比亚大炮完工之后，公众的注意力立即转向炮弹——那个准备把那三位大胆的冒险者送往太空的运输工具。

因此，一些新的图纸被送到奥尔巴尼的布雷德维尔公司，并要求尽快地制造出来。经过如此这般修改过的炮弹于十一月二日铸造完成，并立即通过东方铁路运抵乱石岗。十一月十日，炮弹完好无损地运到目的地。米歇尔·阿尔当、巴比凯恩和尼科尔焦急地等待着这节“炮弹车厢”的到来。

炮弹里装了三英尺深的水，水面上漂浮着一个绝不透水的圆盘状木板，它紧紧地贴着炮弹内壁漂动。乘客们就将坐在这个真正的“木筏”上。至于炮弹内那大量的水，则被一些平放着的隔板隔开；炮弹发射时，这些隔板将被一块一块地相继冲击而破碎。每一层水，从最下面的一层到最上面的一层，都可通过一根根的排水管冲向炮弹的上部；这样一来，它们就像弹簧似的起到缓冲作用，而那个圆盘状木板本身也装有弹力极强的缓冲装置，只有在各层隔板被相继撞碎之后，才会撞上缓冲装置的底部。无疑，当水全部排出去之后，乘客们当然会感觉到一股强大的反冲力；但是，最先出现的那股冲击力几乎完全被那弹力极强的缓冲装置所消除掉了。至于炮弹上部的弹壁，则拿一层很厚的皮垫料包裹起来，而且是安装在最好的钢材制成的螺旋芯上，排水管就藏在这个包裹层里，一点儿也看不出来。因此，所有能想到的防范最初的冲击力的措施都采取了；而且，按照米歇尔·阿尔当的说法，除非是“身体结构极差的人”，否则绝对不会撞得头破血流的。

人需要通过一个在锥形弹头上的狭小进出口进入这个“金属塔”，这个进出口如同蒸汽锅炉上的“人的进出口”一般大小。人进去之后，把铝制门板关上，再将压力螺丝拧紧，进出口便被关得严严实实的了。这样，乘客们一到达月球，就可以自由地从这座活动监狱中走出来了。

在垫料层下面有四扇厚的透镜状玻璃舷窗，其中的两个位于炮弹环状壁上，第三个在炮弹底部，而第四个则在炮弹的圆顶上。只不过为了让舷窗免遭发射时的冲击力的破坏，舷窗外还装了一层坚实的金属护窗板，只需轻轻地拧一下炮弹内的螺丝帽，这块护窗板便会立即脱落。这样，炮弹内的空气就不会外泄，观赏沿途风光便成为可能了。舱内固定着几只容器，用来放置三位乘客所需的水和食物。他们甚至还可以通过被压缩在好几个大气压的特制容器里的煤气点火和点灯。只需拧一下龙头，这煤气就可以保证六小时内照亮和温暖这节舒适的车厢。

食物和照明的问题得以解决，剩下的就是空气的问题了。炮弹载有巴比凯恩及其两位同伴，再加上他们打算带上的两条狗。因此，必须更换炮弹里的空气。大家知道，空气主要是由百分之二十一的氧气和百分之七十九的氮气构成的。人把维持生命的氧气吸进体内，把氮气原封不动地呼出去。呼出去的空气里失去了约百分之五的氧气，又增加了体积大致相等的二氧化碳，而这种二氧化碳是血液氧化过后的必然产物。因此，就会出现这种情况：在一个封闭的环境中，过了一段时间之后，空气中所有的氧气全都被对人体极为有害的二氧化碳所取代。自此，这一问题可以简化为下面这两点：第一，再造被吸入的氧气；第二，破坏呼出的二氧化碳。用氯酸钾和氢氧化钾去处理是最简便不过的了。氯酸钾是一种白色结晶状态下的盐，把它放在四百摄氏度的高温之下，它便会转化成氯化钾，并释放出它所含有的全部氧气。十八磅的氯酸钾能产生七磅的氧气，也就是我们的那几位乘客二十四小时所需的氧气量。

至于氢氧化钾，那是一种对混入空气中的二氧化碳吸收性极强的物质，只需轻轻晃动它，就能吸收二氧化碳，从而形成碳酸氢钾，这就是吸收二氧化碳的方法。把这两种方法结合起来运用，肯定能把污浊的空气净化掉。

但是，必须指出，直到那时为止，这一试验还只是在动物身上进行过。不论它在科学上如何精确，人们都根本不了解这一办法是否适用于人类。

没获准登月的J.T.马斯顿强烈要求获得参加这次试验的殊荣。

“既然我去不成月球，”这位勇敢的炮手说道，“那起码也该让我在炮弹里待上一个星期吧。”

拒绝他的这一要求也太不近情理了。于是，他的心愿得到了满足。炮弹里为他准备了足够的氯酸钾、氢氧化钾和八天的食物。接着，十一月十二日早上六点，他与朋友们握手告别，并且被再三叮嘱二十日晚上六点之前绝对不可打开“监狱”大门。之后，他便钻进炮弹里去，随即将门紧紧地关上。在那一个星期里，是个什么情况，无法知晓。炮弹壁很厚，里面的任何动静都听不到。十一月二十日晚上六点整，铝质门打开了，J.T.马斯顿的朋友们不禁心儿怦怦乱跳。不过，当他们听见一个快乐的声音在高喊“万岁”时，久悬的心便立即放下来了。

很快，大炮俱乐部秘书以胜利者的姿态出现在炮弹的锥形尖顶上。他变胖了！





第二十四章　落基山上架起的望远镜


前一年十月二十日募捐活动结束之后，大炮俱乐部主席便将建造一架巨型光学望远镜所需的款项拨给了剑桥天文台。设计这台仪器的目的是，能清晰地观测到月球表面上的一个直径九英尺大小的物体。

在大炮俱乐部进行它的伟大试验的时候，这类仪器已经特别精密，效果极佳。在这些望远镜中，当时有两架功率极强，体形极大。第一架是赫歇尔制造的，长三十六英尺，装配着一个四英尺六英寸宽的物镜，能将被观测物放大六千倍。第二架架设在爱尔兰的帕森斯顿公园里，属于罗斯勋爵，其镜筒长达四十八英尺，物镜直径六英尺，可以将物体放大六千四百倍，必须建造一个特大的房子才能安放这架重达两万八千磅的仪器，以便操作。

不过，大家都看到了，尽管这些望远镜体形庞大，但所能放大的最大倍数也就是六千倍。可是，放大六千倍只能将月球到地球的距离缩短到三十九英里，只能观测直径有六十英尺的物体，除非该物体特别长。

可发射到太空中的只是一颗直径九英尺、长十五英尺的炮弹。这么看来，至少得将月球的距离拉近到五英里才行，而要想做到这一点，就得制造出一架放大倍数为四万八千倍的望远镜才行。

这就是向剑桥天文台提出的难题。就经费而言，问题并不大，难办的是物资方面困难重重。

经过多次探讨后，确定了仪器的最佳结构和原理依据，制作工作便全面展开了。根据剑桥天文台的计算，新型反射式望远镜的镜筒长度应该是两百八十英尺，而物镜的直径应为十六英尺。这样的一架望远镜尽管体形巨大，但也不比几年前天文学家胡克所建议制造的那架望远镜大。后者建议制造的望远镜长达一万英尺。

至于它的安置地点问题，立即便解决了。要选择一座高山，不过在美利坚合众国内的高山并不太多。确实，在这个广袤的国家，只有两条中等高度的山脉，那条壮丽的密西西比河便在其间流过。如果美国人承认有什么王国的话，他们就会把这条河冠以“河流之王”的。

东边是阿巴拉契亚山脉，最高峰位于新罕布什尔州，高度不到五千六百英尺，这也太矮了。

相反，西边的落基山脉是一条连绵不断的山脉，起自麦哲伦海峡，沿着南美洲西海岸延伸，名为安第斯山脉或科迪勒拉山脉，然后穿过巴拿马地峡，经北美，一直延伸至北冰洋海岸。这些山脉不算很高，与阿尔卑斯山或喜马拉雅山相比，简直是小巫见大巫。的确，它们中最高的那些山峰也只有一万零七百英尺。不过，既然大炮俱乐部坚持要把望远镜和哥伦比亚大炮安置在美利坚合众国内，只好选择落基山脉了，于是一切必需的物资都在往密苏里州境内的朗斯峰上运。

想要描述美国工程师们所要克服的重重困难以及他们在工作中所表现出来的胆略与智慧，非笔墨或语言所能为。那真的是一次壮举。必须越过荒芜的草原，穿过人迹罕至的森林，蹚过可怕的急流，远离人烟，深入几乎无法生存的荒野地区，把一块块巨石、一件件沉甸甸的铸铁、角铁、巨大的镜筒部件，以及重达近三万磅的物镜，弄到高度超过一万英尺的终年积雪的山顶去。然而，这千难万险都被美国人的天才智慧战胜了。开始制造望远镜之后不到一年工夫，在九月的最后几天，那架巨型望远镜便将长达两百八十英尺的镜筒向空中竖起。它挂在一个很大的铁架上，精密的机械装备使之操作方便，可以对准天空中的任何一点，并且可以随着星体的方位移动而移动。

这架望远镜的造价超过四十万美元。当它第一次对准月球的时候，观测者们的心情是既新奇又不安的。他们会在这架可以把物体放大四万八千倍的望远镜的视野中发现些什么呢？会发现一些居民？成群的月球动物？一些城市？一些湖泊？一些海洋？不，只能发现科学界已经知晓的东西，而且在月面的各处，都完全证实了月球的火山性质。

落基山的望远镜在为大炮俱乐部服务之前，已经为天文学做出过巨大贡献。由于它的强大的穿透能力，天空的最深处已经被探测到了，许多星体的视直径被精确地测量过了，而且剑桥天文台的克拉克先生还将蟹状星云从金牛座中分离了出来，这是罗斯勋爵从未做到的。





第二十五章　最后的细节


已经到十一月二十二日了，再过十天大炮就要发射了。只剩下一项工作还需要圆满完成。那是一项棘手的、危险的、要求小心又小心的工作。对于这项工作，尼科尔船长第三次打赌，认为它成功不了。的确，这关系到要给哥伦比亚大炮装填上四十万磅的火棉。尼科尔曾经认为——也许他的想法不无道理——把这么大量的棉火药装进去有可能造成大灾难；而且，不管怎么说，这堆易燃爆性极强的物品在炮弹的压力之下，很可能会自燃。

而且，美国人一向粗心而轻率，这也使得本已很危险的事情变得更加危险了。但是，巴比凯恩一心想着成功，绝不愿功败垂成。

首先，他绝对不许把火棉一下子都运到乱石岗围墙内。他让人把火棉装在密封的弹药车里，分期分批地运进来。火棉通过坦帕城的铁路一车接一车地运到乱石岗来。弹药车一到，光着脚的工匠们就立即卸车，然后用人工操作的吊车把火棉一桶桶地装进哥伦比亚大炮的炮膛里。任何蒸汽机械都被弄出施工现场，而且，方圆两英里内没有一点儿火星。

尽管已是十一月了，但阳光仍然强烈，要让这么多的火棉不被烈日烤燃也非易事。因此，大家宁可夜晚干活儿，借助鲁姆科夫的设备，在真空中制造出人工月光，连哥伦比亚大炮的底部都被照得一清二楚。一桶桶的弹药整齐有序地排列在大炮的底部，彼此之间用一根金属丝连接着，旨在同时将电火花传到火药桶的中心去，也就是说，这么一大堆火棉最终都会被点燃。

十一月二十八日，八百个弹药桶全部在哥伦比亚大炮的底部码放好了。这一步的工作算是圆满地完成了。但是，在此期间，巴比凯恩主席经受了多少煎熬和抗争啊！他的确在禁止闲杂人等进入乱石岗，但是，每天都有许许多多的好奇者攀爬栅栏，有的甚至疯狂得置危险于不顾，竟然跑到火棉堆前抽起烟来。巴比凯恩每天都怒气冲天。J.T.马斯顿想尽办法协助他，拼命地驱赶擅自闯入者，并且仔细地捡拾美国佬们随地扔下的烟头。这个活儿可够艰苦的，因为有三十多万人挤在栅栏旁。米歇尔·阿尔当自告奋勇地一路押运弹药车，直到哥伦比亚大炮的炮口。但是，大炮俱乐部主席却发现这个阿尔当一面撵走擅自闯入者，一面自己嘴里还衔着一支大雪茄。这可是给那帮冒失鬼树立了一个极可怕的榜样，所以他感到不能太信赖这个烟不离嘴的家伙，只好派专人紧紧地盯着阿尔当。

最后，好像神明在庇护这些炮手似的，没有发生爆炸之类的事情，弹药装填工作圆满结束。因此，尼科尔船长的第三次打赌看来是输定了。现在就看把炮弹装入哥伦比亚大炮，并将它放置在厚厚的一层火棉上会怎么样了。

但是，在进行这项工作之前，必须把旅行所必备的东西先装进炮弹车厢，整齐有序地放置好。东西很多，如果把这事交由阿尔当去办，那他立即就会把留给乘客们的位置给挤占掉了。没人能想象得出这个可爱的法国人要把多少东西带到月球上去。肯定是一大堆乱七八糟的无用之物。巴比凯恩只好出面干预，只能带上一些必不可少的东西。于是，工具箱里放了好几支温度计、气压计和好几副望远镜。

旅行者们都盼着沿途好好地观测月球，所以为了方便大家了解这个新的世界，还带了一张比尔和默德雷制作的精美的月球图。该图被公认为是经耐心观察之后绘制而成的真正杰作。这幅图精确地再现了月球运行时面对地球那一部分的全部的细微地形变化：山脉、峡谷、火山口、山峰以及沟壑等都标得一清二楚，大小无误，方位精确；从高高矗立在月面东部的多尔弗尔山和莱布尼兹山，一直延伸至北部极地地区的“冰海”，都一一标清了名称。

他们还带了三支来复枪和三支装有爆炸弹头的猎枪；另外，还带了数量可观的火药和铅弹。

“我们并不知道将要面对的是谁，”米歇尔·阿尔当说道，“人或者兽都可能认为我们去拜访他（它）们是不怀好意的！所以必须有所准备。”

除了防身武器外，他们还带上了一些鹤嘴锄、十字镐、手锯，以及其他一些必不可少的工具；当然，在各种气候条件下——从严寒到酷热——所必备的衣服也是不能不带上的。

阿尔当想带上一定数量的动物，当然不必每种动物都带上一对，因为他觉得没必要跑到月球上去驯化蛇、虎、鳄，以及其他一些凶猛的野兽。“这都用不着，”他对巴比凯恩说道，“不过，带上几头牲口，小公牛或奶牛，驴或马，不仅会给旅行增添乐趣，而且可以派上大用场。”

“我同意你的意见，亲爱的阿尔当，”大炮俱乐部主席回答道，“但是，我的炮弹车厢并非挪亚方舟，它既无这么大的能力，也没这一使命。所以，我们还是尽我们的所能吧。”

最后，经过一番争论，旅行者们一致同意只带上尼科尔的那条母猎犬和一条很强壮的纽芬兰公狗，还带上了好几箱最有用的种子，那是必不可少的物品之一。如果任由米歇尔·阿尔当处理的话，他肯定还会带上几袋泥土，好在月球上播种。不过，他还是带上了十多棵小树苗，仔细用稻草包裹好，打算栽种到月球上。

剩下的就是重要的食物问题了，因为必须考虑到着陆地点可能是月球上绝对贫瘠的地方。巴比凯恩心细，带上了足够吃一年的粮食。这些食物，包括肉和蔬菜，是经过水力压榨机压过的压缩食品，体积很小，但营养成分并未减少。另外还储备了白兰地和只够两个月消耗的水。其实，根据天文学家们最近的观测，毋庸置疑，月球表面有着一定数量的水。至于粮食，认为地球居民在月球上找不到吃的，那简直是一派胡言。在这一点上，阿尔当是坚信不疑的。如果他有此疑惑的话，也就不会决定去月球了。

“再说，”有一天，他对他的朋友们说，“我们在地球上的同事们不会完全抛下我们不管的，他们肯定不会不与我们联系的。”

“肯定不会的！”J.T.马斯顿回答道。

“这很简单嘛，”阿尔当回答道，“哥伦比亚大炮不是将一直待在那儿吗？喏！每当月球出现在天顶时，即使不在近地点，也就是说，差不多一年一次，地球上的同事们难道就不能发射几颗装满食物的炮弹给我们吗？我们只需在固定的日子在上面等着就行了。”

“好极了！好极了！”J.T.马斯顿呼喊道，“多么聪明的家伙！说得真好！我的好朋友们，我们肯定不会忘记你们的！”

“那就仰仗诸位了！因此，你们也明白了，我们将定期获得地球上的消息；对我们而言，如果无法与我们在地球上的好友们通消息，那我们就两眼一抹黑了！”

米歇尔·阿尔当神色坚定、镇静自若地说出的这番话，让大炮俱乐部所有的人都恨不得跟着飞往月球去。他的话说得非常简单、普通，确信胜利在望，让人觉得非跟他们三人一起登月不可，否则就枉为人了，只能可怜巴巴地生活在这个倒霉的地球上。

最后，一切准备就绪，只差将炮弹装进哥伦比亚大炮里去了。不过，装弹工作充满着危险和困难。

巨型炮弹运到了乱石岗山顶。几部功率强大的吊车钩住它，悬于金属竖井上方。

这是让人心惊肉跳的一刻！万一缆绳突然被这么重的一个大家伙坠断了，它便会掉下来，引着火棉，必然爆炸。

幸好，什么意外也没发生。几个小时之后，“炮弹车厢”平缓地在炮膛里往下滑落，停放在像易燃的鸭绒被一样厚厚的火棉层上。它的压力除了把哥伦比亚大炮的火药层压得更瓷实一点儿之外，没有其他任何影响。

“我输了。”船长边说边将三千美元交给巴比凯恩主席。

巴比凯恩不愿接受旅伴的钱，但是，见尼科尔坚持要给，他不得不做出让步，因为尼科尔坚持在离开地球之前履行自己的诺言。

“这么说，”米歇尔·阿尔当说道，“我现在只有一件事要祝福您了，我的好船长。”

“哪一件？”尼科尔问道。

“就是祝您输掉另外的两次赌注呗！这样一来，我们就笃定不会停在半路上了。”





第二十六章　发射！


十二月的头一天终于来到了，这可是决定成败的一天！因为如果炮弹不能在当晚十点四十六分四十秒发射出去的话，那就只好再等上十八年多，月球才会同时位于天顶和近地点。

天气晴朗。尽管冬天将近，太阳仍然灿烂，整个地球沐浴在阳光中，它的三个居民将离它而去，飞向新世界。

许许多多的人都在焦急地等待着这一天的到来。他们在头一天晚上辗转反侧，简直难以成眠！有多少人因这种难以忍受的期待之苦而憋闷难耐啊！人人都焦虑不安，心在怦怦直跳，只有米歇尔·阿尔当是个例外。这个沉着稳健的人像往常一样忙忙碌碌，跑来跑去，看不出他心中有任何不寻常的担心。

从一大清早起，人群便黑压压地挤满了乱石岗周围那一望无际的大草原。每隔一刻钟，从坦帕城发来的火车便送来新一批好奇者。人流不断地涌来，越聚越多，很快便人满为患了。根据《坦帕城观察家报》的统计，在这个难忘的日子里，有不下五百万个看热闹的人踏上了佛罗里达州的这片土地。

一个月以来，其中的大部分人都在围墙周围安营扎寨，这为日后被称为“阿尔当城”的城市奠定了基础。草原上随处可见临时搭起的木板屋、茅屋、窝棚和帐篷。在这里，地球上各个民族的人都有，他们操着各自的方言土语，简直就像是各种语言的大杂烩，如同《圣经》中记载的巴别塔[50]一样。在这里，美国社会的各个阶层混杂在一起，完全平等。银行家、农民、水手、棉花种植者、掮客、商人、船夫、官员等像原始人一样摩肩接踵，你挤我拥。路易斯安那的克里奥尔人[51]同印第安纳的农夫们称兄道弟；肯塔基和田纳西的绅士们、衣冠楚楚的高傲的弗吉尼亚人，同大湖区半开化的设陷阱捕捉毛皮兽的猎人以及辛辛那提的牛贩子们一起高谈阔论。他们头戴阔边的白海狸皮皮帽，或者传统的巴拿马草帽，下穿蓝色棉长裤，上身套着雅致的棉布服，足蹬颜色鲜艳的低筒皮靴，炫耀着怪异的襟饰，还故意显摆衬衣上、袖口上、领带上、十个指头上，甚至耳朵上的所有的装饰品：戒指、胸针和小装饰品，价格昂贵，但却庸俗不堪。妇女、儿童、仆人等的穿戴也毫不逊色，前呼后拥地围着丈夫、父亲和主人；后者在家人、家丁的簇拥之下，简直就像部落的酋长一般。

吃饭的时候，不妨看看这帮人是如何如狼似虎地扑向南部各州的特色菜肴的，如炖田鸡、焖猴肉、杂烩鱼、烤负鼠肉、烧浣熊肉等。同样，饮料或酒也种类繁多，帮助人们去消化上述那些难以消化的食物。酒吧或小酒馆里玻璃杯、啤酒杯、酒瓶、长颈大肚玻璃瓶等各种形状的瓶子比比皆是，还有各种各样的磨糖块的钵和成扎的麦管。人们又唱又叫，喊声如雷，令人难耐！“薄荷糖浆酒！”一个卖酒人喊道。“波尔多桑加里酒！”另外一个喊道。“鸡尾酒！”“白兰地！”“尝尝真正的最新口味的薄荷糖浆酒呀！”所有叫喊声交织在一起，处处是震耳欲聋的喧哗声。

但是，那一天，十二月的头一天，叫喊吆喝声变得又弱又小。没有人想着吃点儿什么喝点儿什么；而且，一直到下午四点，有许多人还在人群中窜来窜去，连午饭都没吃。当天即将发生的大事吸引了人们，消除了一切需求，没有给娱乐留下一席之地。

一直到晚上，没有任何喧嚣之声，如同大难临头一般，有的只是一种焦躁不安，笼罩在焦急的人们心头。人人的心里都有着一种说不清道不明的不适感，一种莫名的压抑感聚在心间，一种无法形容的感觉在揪着人们的心。人人都企盼着“这赶紧成为过去”。

然而，将近七点钟的时候，这沉闷的寂静突然间被打破了。月亮从地平线上升起。数百万人的欢呼声在向升起的月亮致敬。它准时践约。人们的呼喊声直冲云霄。当月亮女神在美丽的夜空中安详地照耀，并用它那皎洁的月光轻抚着如醉如痴的人们的时候，四面八方的喝彩声响成一片。这时候，三位勇敢无畏的旅行者出现了。人们一看见他们，欢呼声便变得更加激烈。这一大群人立刻齐声唱起了美国国歌，五百万人齐声合唱《扬基歌》[52]，歌声嘹亮，直上云霄。之后，人群陷入了深深的沉默。

这时候，那位法国人和那两位美国人已经走过外面挤满了人的围墙。他们由大炮俱乐部的会员们以及欧洲各个天文台的代表们陪同着。巴比凯恩冷静沉着，平静地下达最后的几道命令。尼科尔紧抿着嘴，双手背在身后，步伐坚定而有力。米歇尔·阿尔当仍旧一副悠然自得的样子，一副真正的旅行者的装扮，绑着皮护腿，腰间系着腰包，一身宽大的天鹅绒套装，嘴里叼着烟；他精神饱满，热情洋溢，笑个不停，还不时地逗弄J.T.马斯顿。总而言之，直到最后一刻，他都表现得像一个“地道的法国人”，或者更糟的是，是个“巴黎人”。

十点了。登上炮弹车厢的时刻到了。要登上去，必须经过一道道“关卡”，然后拧紧门板螺钉，移走吊车，拆除哥伦比亚大炮炮口上的脚手架，凡此种种，颇费时间。

巴比凯恩把他那只精确到十分之一秒的秒表与默奇森的表对了一下，默奇森负责用电火花点燃火药。进入炮弹车厢的旅行者们可以盯着不慌不忙地走着的指针，它将指明他们出发的准确时间。

告别的时刻终于到了，场面极其感人。米歇尔·阿尔当尽管开心快乐，但仍不免十分激动。J.T.马斯顿一向眼皮干涩，很久未见泪水，但此时此刻也不禁流出了一滴保存良久的眼泪来。他将他的这滴眼泪滴在了他的亲切的主席的额头上。

“我能跟你们一起去吗？”他说道，“现在还来得及！”

“不行啊，老兄。”巴比凯恩回答道。片刻之后，那三位旅伴便坐进了炮弹车厢里，从里面将门板螺钉拧紧。然后，哥伦比亚大炮那已经完全解放了的炮口，自由地朝向天空。

月亮在纯净的天空中移动着；在月亮的运行途中，所有的星星都显得黯然无光了。月亮穿过了双子座，几乎到了地平线与天顶的正中间。

一种瘆人的寂静笼罩着这一切。大地上没有一丝风！人人的胸中都紧憋着气！心脏都不敢跳动了！所有惶恐不安的目光都紧紧地盯着哥伦比亚大炮的炮口。

默奇森的目光紧盯着他的秒表的指针。离点火的时间只有四十秒了，可那嘀嗒作响的秒针转动的每一秒，都像一个世纪一般漫长。当秒表的指针走到二十秒的时候，所有的人全都战栗了一下，人人都突然感到，被关在炮弹车厢里的那几位勇敢的旅行者也在数着那可怕的一秒又一秒！有一些声音孤零零地在数着：

“三十五！——三十六！——三十七！——三十八！——三十九！——四十！——点火！”

默奇森立即用手指摁下开关，电流接通，电火花传向哥伦比亚大炮的底部。

刹那间，传来一声可怕的、闻所未闻的、超常的巨响，无论霹雳声、火山喷发声或者其他什么声响，都没法与它相比。一束巨大的火焰，如同从火山中喷发出来一般，从地底深处轰然喷出。大地在抖动。只有少数几个人能在刹那间隐隐约约地看见炮弹在烈火浓烟中傲然地划破长空。





第二十七章　恶劣的天气


当炽热的烈焰冲上云霄时，迸发出来的光芒照亮了整个佛罗里达州。在无法计算时间有多久的那个瞬间，在这一大片地区，白昼代替了黑夜。这么巨大的一团火焰在一百英里远的地方都可以看见，不止一位船长在自己的航海日志上记下了这个宏大的大气现象的出现。

哥伦比亚大炮轰然一声响，大地就像遇上了地震一般发颤。连佛罗里达州的地底深处都在颤动。火药爆炸所产生的气体因高温而扩散，以无可比拟的威力冲击大气层；而这股人造的飓风要比暴风雨中的飓风更加迅猛上百倍，像一股龙卷风似的在空中掠过。

观看者中无人能站得稳。男人、女人、儿童，全都像被暴风雨击打过的麦子一般倒伏在地，随即传来一阵阵撕心裂肺的惨叫声，很多人受了重伤。J.T.马斯顿因为太掉以轻心，站得太靠近，结果像一发炮弹似的从他的同胞们的头顶上方飞过，被抛到二十托瓦兹开外的地方。霎时间，三十万观者惊呆了，什么也听不见了。

最初的一阵混乱平静下来之后，伤者、失聪者等所有的人全都惊醒过来，拼命地在叫喊着：“阿尔当万岁！巴比凯恩万岁！尼科尔万岁！”狂热的欢呼声直冲云霄。好几百万人抬头仰望天空，举起望远镜，仔细地搜索着，全然不顾扭伤、摔伤和疼痛，只顾追踪那炮弹车厢。但是，他们怎么看都是白费力气！他们看不到它了，只有耐心地等待来自朗斯峰的电报了。剑桥天文台台长正在落基山上坚守着自己的岗位，而观测的使命正落到了这位才华横溢、坚韧不拔的天文学家头上。

不过，有一个尽管很容易预料但却并未预见到的而又令人感到无能为力的现象，对公众的耐心是极大的考验。

此前一直晴朗的天空突然变得浓云密布。大气层被猛烈地冲击之后，在四十万磅棉火药燃烧后所产生的大量烟雾的弥漫之下，天空不被浓烟所遮蔽，还会是什么样子呢？

第二天，太阳照常升起，只是天边浓云密布，仿佛天地间挂着一块厚重而无法穿透的巨大幕布；遗憾的是，这块幕布一直延伸到落基山地区。这可是一个沉重的打击！既然人类用大炮扰乱了大气层，就应该喝下自酿的苦酒。

如果试验成功了，那么十二月一日十点四十六分四十秒出发的旅行者们就该在四日午夜抵达目的地。因此，在这之前的几天里，反正在这种条件之下很难看到像炮弹这么小的一个东西，所以嚷嚷也没有用，只能尽可能耐心地等待着。

从十二月四日到六日，美国的天气大致相同，伟大的欧洲天文观测器，赫歇尔的，罗斯的和福柯的，一直朝着月亮，因为当时的天气很好；但是这些观测器镜片的相对弱点妨碍了观测，没有得出任何可靠的观测结果。

七日，天空好像稍微有了点儿变化。大家都在企盼着，但这种希望并未维持多久，厚厚的云层卷土重来，挡住了漫天繁星，也挡住了人们的视线。

如此看来，情况变得严重了。九日，太阳又露出了一小会儿，像是在嘲讽美国人似的。大家冲着太阳骂骂咧咧，它大概是因这种对待而大伤自尊，便更不愿抛洒它的光芒了。

十日，无变化。J.T.马斯顿几乎要疯了。大家都替这位可敬之人担心着，生怕他的脑子会出问题；而此前，他的那颗古塔橡胶制成的脑壳一直都在很好地保护着他的脑袋。

但是，十一日，一场可怕的热带风暴刮了起来。猛烈的东风把聚集了很长时间的阴云吹散了；到了夜晚，被吞噬了一半的月面庄重地显现在清澈的星空之中。





第二十八章　一颗新星


当天夜里，让人焦急企盼的那个激动人心的消息如一声霹雳，响彻美利坚合众国的每一个州，并从美国越过大洋，在全球各条电报线上传送着。多亏了朗斯峰的那架巨型望远镜，炮弹车厢被观测到了。下面便是剑桥天文台台长做的记录。它对大炮俱乐部的这次伟大的尝试给出了科学的结论。

朗斯峰　十二月十二日

致剑桥天文台的先生们：

十二月十二日晚八点四十七分，贝尔法斯特先生和J.T.马斯顿先生在月亮进入下弦月时，观测到了哥伦比亚大炮从乱石岗发射的炮弹。

这颗炮弹并未到达目的地。它从月球近旁飞过，不过，几乎是擦肩而过的，但是它还是被月球的引力吸住了。

这时候，它的直线运动变成了一种令人头晕目眩的极速圆周运动，并被吸附在环绕月球的一个椭圆形轨道上，成了月球的一颗名副其实的卫星。

这颗新的星球的情况尚无法确定。我们既不了解它的移动速度，也不知道它的自转速度。它与月球表面的距离估计约有两千八百三十三英里。

现在，可能会有两种假设出现，它们可能会改变现状。

或者月球的引力占上风，炮弹车厢上的旅行者们将到达目的地；或者炮弹车厢被固定在一个一成不变的轨道上，围绕月球运转，直到世界末日。

天文观测有一天会得出结论的；但是，在这之前，大炮俱乐部的尝试除了为太阳系增添了一颗新星以外，并无其他任何成果。

J. M.贝尔法斯特

这个意外的结局引出了多少问题啊！未来留待科学研究的将会有多少奥秘啊！无论如何，尼科尔、巴比凯恩、米歇尔·阿尔当的名字将永远载入天文学大事记里。

朗斯峰的报告一经公布，立即在全世界引起了一片惊讶与恐慌。有没有可能帮这三位勇敢的地球居民一把？想必是没有，因为他们已经越过上帝为地球生物划定的界线，跑到人类以外的地方去了。他们还有两个月的空气可供自己呼吸。他们尚有一年的余粮。可是，这之后呢？……

只有一个人不愿承认情况已经到了令人绝望的程度。只有一个人仍有信心，那就是他们忠实的朋友J.T.马斯顿。

他的眼睛仍一直盯着他的朋友们。从今往后，他的家就定在朗斯峰天文台了，他的视野就是那架巨型望远镜的反射镜。只要月亮一从地平线上升起，他就将它框在望远镜的视野里，目光一刻也不离开它，执着地紧紧盯着它穿过星空运行。他坚持不懈地耐心观测着炮弹车厢经过银色的月面。这个可敬可爱的人真的在与他的三个朋友保持着永远的联系，他坚信总有一天会再见到他们的。

“那三个人，”他说道，“就能将艺术、科学和技术的精华带到太空。有了这种本领，一个人就能心想事成；而你们将看到，他们会摆脱困难，遇难成祥！”





Chapter I The Gun Club


During the War of the Rebellion, a new and influential club was established in the city of Baltimore in the State of Maryland. It is well known with what energy the taste for military matters became developed among that nation of ship-owners, shopkeepers, and mechanics.Simple tradesmen jumped their counters to become extemporized captains, colonels, and generals, without having ever passed the School of Instruction at West Point；nevertheless, they quickly rivaled their compeers of the old continent, and, like them, carried off victories by dint of lavish expenditure in ammunition, money, and men.

But the point in which the Americans singularly distanced the Europeans was in the science of gunnery. Not, indeed, that their weapons retained a higher degree of perfection than theirs, but that they exhibited unheard-of dimensions, and consequently attained hitherto unheard-of ranges.In point of grazing, plunging, oblique, or enfilading, or point-blank firing, the English, French, and Prussians have nothing to learn；but their cannon, howitzers, and mortars are mere pocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines of the American artillery.

This fact need surprise no one. The Yankees, the first mechanicians in the world, are engineers—just as the Italians are musicians and the Germans metaphysicians—by right of birth.Nothing is more natural, therefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to the science of gunnery.Witness the marvels of Parrott, Dahlgren, and Rodman.The Armstrong, Palliser, and Beaulieu guns were compelled to bow before their transatlantic rivals.

Now when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second American to share it. If there be three, they elect a president and two secretaries.Given four, they name a keeper of records, and the office is ready for work；five, they convene a general meeting, and the club is fully constituted.So things were managed in Baltimore.The inventor of a new cannon associated himself with the caster and the borer.Thus was formed the nucleus of the“Gun Club”.In a single month after its formation it numbered 1，833 effective members and 30，565 corresponding members.

One condition was imposed as a sine qua non upon every candidate for admission into the association, and that was the condition of having designed, or（more or less）perfected a cannon；or, in default of a cannon, at least a firearm of some description. It may, however, be mentioned that mere inventors of revolvers, fire-shooting carbines, and similar small arms, met with little consideration.Artillerists always commanded the chief place of favor.

The estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to one of the most scientific exponents of the Gun Club, was“proportional to the masses of their guns, and in the direct ratio of the square of the distances attained by their projectiles”.

The Gun Club once founded, it is easy to conceive the result of the inventive genius of the Americans. Their military weapons attained colossal proportions, and their projectiles, exceeding the prescribed limits, unfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending pedestrians.These inventions, in fact, left far in the rear the timid instruments of European artillery.

It is but fair to add that these Yankees, brave as they have ever proved themselves to be, did not confine themselves to theories and formulae, but that they paid heavily, in propria persona, for their inventions. Among them were to be counted officers of all ranks, from lieutenants to generals；military men of every age, from those who were just making their debut in the profession of arms up to those who had grown old in the gun-carriage.Many had found their rest on the field of battle whose names figured in the“Book of Honor”of the Gun Club；and of those who made good their return the greater proportion bore the marks of their indisputable valor.Crutches, wooden legs, artificial arms, steel hooks, caoutchouc jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses, were all to be found in the collection；and it was calculated by the great statistician Pitcairn that throughout the Gun Club there was not quite one arm between four persons and two legs between six.

Nevertheless, these valiant artillerists took no particular account of these little facts, and felt justly proud when the despatches of a battle returned the number of victims at ten-fold the quantity of projectiles expended.

One day, however—sad and melancholy day！—peace was signed between the survivors of the war；the thunder of the guns gradually ceased, the mortars were silent, the howitzers were muzzled for an indefinite period, the cannon, with muzzles depressed, were returned into the arsenal, the shot were repiled, all bloody reminiscences were effaced；the cotton-plants grew luxuriantly in the well-manured fields, all mourning garments were laid aside, together with grief；and the Gun Club was relegated to profound inactivity.

Some few of the more advanced and inveterate theorists set themselves again to work upon calculations regarding the laws of projectiles. They reverted invariably to gigantic shells and howitzers of unparalleled caliber.Still in default of practical experience what was the value of mere theories?Consequently, the clubrooms became deserted, the servants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the tables, sounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of the Gun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to silence by this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly to dreams of a Platonic kind of artillery.

“This is horrible！”said Tom Hunter one evening, while rapidly carbonizing his wooden legs in the fireplace of the smoking-room；“Nothing to do！Nothing to look forward to！What a loathsome existence！When again shall the guns arouse us in the morning with their delightful reports?”

“Those days are gone by，”said jolly Bilsby, trying to extend his missing arms.“It was delightful once upon a time！One invented a gun, and hardly was it cast, when one hastened to try it in the face of the enemy！Then one returned to camp with a word of encouragement from Sherman or a friendly shake of the hand from McClellan. But now the generals are gone back to their counters；and in place of projectiles, they despatch bales of cotton.By Jove, the future of gunnery in America is lost！”

“Ay！And no war in prospect！”continued the famous J. T.Maston, scratching with his steel hook his gutta-percha cranium.“Not a cloud on the horizon！And that too at such a critical period in the progress of the science of artillery！Yes, gentlemen！I who address you have myself this very morning perfected a model（plan, section, elevation, etc.）of a mortar destined to change all the conditions of warfare！”

“No！Is it possible?”replied Tom Hunter, his thoughts reverting involuntarily to a former invention of the Hon. J.T.Maston, by which, at its first trial, he had succeeded in killing three hundred and thirty-seven people.

“Fact！”replied he.“Still, what is the use of so many studies worked out, so many difficulties vanquished?It's mere waste of time！The New World seems to have made up its mind to live in peace；and our bellicose Tribune predicts some approaching catastrophes arising out of this scandalous increase of population.”

“Nevertheless，”replied Colonel Blomsberry，“they are always struggling in Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities.”

“Well?”

“Well, there might be some field for enterprise down there；and if they would accept our services—”

“What are you dreaming of?”screamed Bilsby.“Work at gunnery for the benefit of foreigners?”

“That would be better than doing nothing here，”returned the colonel.

“Quite so，”said J. T.Matson；“but still we need not dream of that expedient.”

“And why not?”demanded the colonel.

“Because their ideas of progress in the Old World are contrary to our American habits of thought. Those fellows believe that one can't become a general without having served first as an ensign；which is as much as to say that one can't point a gun without having first cast it oneself！”

“Ridiculous！”replied Tom Hunter, whittling with his bowie-knife the arms of his easy chair；“but if that be the case there, all that is left for us is to plant tobacco and distill whale-oil.”

“What！”roared J. T.Maston.“Shall we not employ these remaining years of our life in perfecting firearms?Shall there never be a fresh opportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles?Shall the air never again be lighted with the glare of our guns?No international difficulty ever arise to enable us to declare war against some transatlantic power?Shall not the French sink one of our steamers, or the English, in defiance of the rights of nations, hang a few of our countrymen?”

“No such luck，”replied Colonel Blomsberry；“nothing of the kind is likely to happen；and even if it did, we should not profit by it. American susceptibility is fast declining, and we are all going to the dogs.”

“It is too true，”replied J. T.Maston, with fresh violence；“there are a thousand grounds for fighting, and yet we don't fight.We save up our arms and legs for the benefit of nations who don't know what to do with them！But stop—without going out of one's way to find a cause for war—did not North America once belong to the English?”

“Undoubtedly，”replied Tom Hunter, stamping his crutch with fury.

“Well, then，”replied J. T.Maston，“why should not England in her turn belong to the Americans?”

“It would be but just and fair，”returned Colonel Blomsberry.

“Go and propose it to the President of the United States，”cried J. T.Maston，“and see how he will receive you.”

“Bah！”growled Bilsby between the four teeth which the war had left him；“that will never do！”

“By Jove！”cried J. T.Maston.“He mustn't count on my vote at the next election！”

“Nor on ours，”replied unanimously all the bellicose invalids.

“Meanwhile，”replied J. T.Maston，“allow me to say that, if I cannot get an opportunity to try my new mortars on a real field of battle, I shall say good-bye to the members of the Gun Club, and go and bury myself in the prairies of Arkansas！”

“In that case we will accompany you，”cried the others.

Matters were in this unfortunate condition, and the club was threatened with approaching dissolution, when an unexpected circumstance occurred to prevent so deplorable a catastrophe.

On the morrow after this conversation every member of the association received a sealed circular couched in the following terms：

BALTIMORE, October 3.

The president of the Gun Club has the honor to inform his colleagues that, at the meeting of the 5th instant, he will bring before them a communication of an extremely interesting nature. He requests, therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in accordance with the present invitation.Very cordially，

IMPEY BARBICANE, P. G.C.





Chapter II President Barbicane’s Communication


On the 5th of October, at eight P. M.，a dense crowd pressed toward the saloons of the Gun Club at No.21 Union Square.All the members of the association resident in Baltimore attended the invitation of their president.As regards the corresponding members, notices were delivered by hundreds throughout the streets of the city, and, large as was the great hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of savants.They overflowed into the adjoining rooms, down the narrow passages, into the outer courtyards.There they ran against the vulgar herd who pressed up to the doors, each struggling to reach the front ranks, all eager to learn the nature of the important communication of President Barbicane；all pushing, squeezing, crushing with that perfect freedom of the action which is so peculiar to the masses when educated in ideas of“self-government”.

On that evening a stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore could not have gained admission for love or money into the great hall. That was reserved exclusively for resident or corresponding members；no one else could possibly have obtained a place；and the city magnates, municipal councilors, and“select men”were compelled to mingle with the mere townspeople in order to catch stray bits of news from the interior.

Nevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle. Its immense area was singularly adapted to the purpose.Lofty pillars formed of cannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine ironwork of the arches, a perfect piece of cast-iron lacework.Trophies of blunderbuses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all kinds of firearms, ancient and modern, were picturesquely interlaced against the walls.The gas lit up in full glare myriads of revolvers grouped in the form of lustres, while groups of pistols, and candelabra formed of muskets bound together, completed this magnificent display of brilliance.Models of cannon, bronze castings, sights covered with dents, plates battered by the shots of the Gun Club, assortments of rammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, wreaths of projectiles, garlands of howitzers—in short, all the apparatus of the artillerist, enchanted the eye by this wonderful arrangement and induced a kind of belief that their real purpose was ornamental rather than deadly.

At the further end of the saloon the president, assisted by four secretaries, occupied a large platform. His chair, supported by a carved gun-carriage, was modeled upon the ponderous proportions of a 32-inch mortar.It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees, and suspended upon truncheons, so that the president could balance himself upon it as upon a rocking-chair, a very agreeable fact in the very hot weather.Upon the table（a huge iron plate supported upon six carronades）stood an inkstand of exquisite elegance, made of a beautifully chased Spanish piece, and a sonnette, which, when required, could give forth a report equal to that of a revolver.During violent debates this novel kind of bell scarcely sufficed to drown the clamor of these excitable artillerists.

In front of the table benches arranged in zigzag form, like the circumvallations of a retrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and curtains set apart for the use of the members of the club；and on this especial evening one might say，“All the world was on the ramparts.”The president was sufficiently well known, however, for all to be assured that he would not put his colleagues to discomfort without some very strong motive.

Impey Barbicane was a man of forty years of age, calm, cold, austere；of a singularly serious and self-contained demeanor, punctual as a chronometer, of imperturbable temper and immovable character；by no means chivalrous, yet adventurous withal, and always bringing practical ideas to bear upon the very rashest enterprises；an essentially New Englander, a Northern colonist, a descendant of the old anti-Stuart Roundheads, and the implacable enemy of the gentlemen of the South, those ancient cavaliers of the mother country. In a word, he was a Yankee to the backbone.

Barbicane had made a large fortune as a timber merchant. Being nominated director of artillery during the war, he proved himself fertile in invention.Bold in his conceptions, he contributed powerfully to the progress of that arm and gave an immense impetus to experimental researches.

He was personage of the middle height, having, by a rare exception in the Gun Club, all his limbs complete. His strongly marked features seemed drawn by square and rule；and if it be true that, in order to judge a man's character one must look at his profile, Barbicane, so examined, exhibited the most certain indications of energy, audacity, and sang-froid.

At this moment he was sitting in his armchair, silent, absorbed, lost in reflection, sheltered under his high-crowned hat—a kind of black cylinder which always seems firmly screwed upon the head of an American.

Just when the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck eight, Barbicane, as if he had been set in motion by a spring, raised himself up. A profound silence ensued, and the speaker, in a somewhat emphatic tone of voice, commenced as follows：

“My brave colleagues, too long already a paralyzing peace has plunged the members of the Gun Club in deplorable inactivity. After a period of years full of incidents, we have been compelled to abandon our labors, and to stop short on the road of progress.I do not hesitate to state, baldly, that any war which would recall us to arms would be welcome！”（Tremendous applause！）“But war, gentlemen, is impossible under existing circumstances；and, however we may desire it, many years may elapse before our cannon shall again thunder in the field of battle.We must make up our minds, then, to seek in another train of ideas some field for the activity which we all pine for.”

The meeting felt that the president was now approaching the critical point, and redoubled their attention accordingly.

“For some months past, my brave colleagues，”continued Barbicane，“I have been asking myself whether, while confining ourselves to our own particular objects, we could not enter upon some grand experiment worthy of the nineteenth century；and whether the progress of artillery science would not enable us to carry it out to a successful issue. I have been considering, working, calculating；and the result of my studies is the conviction that we are safe to succeed in an enterprise which to any other country would appear wholly impracticable.This project, the result of long elaboration, is the object of my present communication.It is worthy of yourselves, worthy of the antecedents of the Gun Club；and it cannot fail to make some noise in the world.”

A thrill of excitement ran through the meeting.

Barbicane, having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his head, calmly continued his harangue：

“There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen the Moon, or, at least, heard speak of it. Don't be surprised if I am about to discourse to you regarding the Queen of the Night.It is perhaps reserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world.Only enter into my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead you to its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the thirty-six states which compose this Great Union.”

“Three cheers for the Moon！”roared the Gun Club, with one voice.

“The moon, gentlemen, has been carefully studied，”continued Barbicane；“her mass, density, and weight；her constitution, motions, distance, as well as her place in the solar system, have all been exactly determined. Selenographic charts have been constructed with a perfection which equals, if it does not even surpass, that of our terrestrial maps.Photography has given us proofs of the incomparable beauty of our satellite；all is known regarding the moon which mathematical science, astronomy, geology, and optics can learn about her.But up to the present moment no direct communication has been established with her.”

A violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this remark of the speaker.

“Permit me，”he continued，“to recount to you briefly how certain ardent spirits, starting on imaginary journeys, have penetrated the secrets of our satellite. In the seventeenth century a certain David Fabricius boasted of having seen with his own eyes the inhabitants of the moon.In 1649 a Frenchman, one Jean Baudoin, published a‘Journey performed from the Earth to the Moon by Domingo Gonzalez'，a Spanish adventurer.At the same period Cyrano de Bergerac published that celebrated‘Journeys in the Moon'which met with such success in France.Somewhat later another Frenchman, named Fontenelle, wrote‘The Plurality of Worlds'，a chef-d'oeuvre of its time.About 1835 a small treatise, translated from the New York American, related how Sir John Herschel, having been despatched to the Cape of Good Hope for the purpose of making there some astronomical calculations, had, by means of a telescope brought to perfection by means of internal lighting, reduced the apparent distance of the moon to eighty yards！He then distinctly perceived caverns frequented by hippopotami, green mountains bordered by golden lace-work, sheep with horns of ivory, a white species of deer and inhabitants with membranous wings, like bats.This brochure, the work of an American named Locke, had a great sale.But, to bring this rapid sketch to a close, I will only add that a certain Hans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, launching himself in a balloon filled with a gas extracted from nitrogen, thirty-seven times lighter than hydrogen, reached the moon after a passage of nineteen hours.This journey, like all previous ones, was purely imaginary；still, it was the work of a popular American author—I mean Edgar Poe！”

“Cheers for Edgar Poe！”roared the assemblage, electrified by their president's words.

“I have now enumerated，”said Barbicane，“the experiments which I call purely paper ones, and wholly insufficient to establish serious relations with the Queen of the Night. Nevertheless, I am bound to add that some practical geniuses have attempted to establish actual communication with her.Thus, a few days ago, a German geometrician proposed to send a scientific expedition to the steppes of Siberia.There, on those vast plains, they were to describe enormous geometric figures, drawn in characters of reflecting luminosity, among which was the proposition regarding the‘square of the hypothenuse'，commonly called the‘Ass's Bridge'by the French.‘Every intelligent being，'said the geometrician，‘must understand the scientific meaning of that figure.The Selenites, do they exist, will respond by a similar figure；and, a communication being thus once established, it will be easy to form an alphabet which shall enable us to converse with the inhabitants of the moon.'So spoke the German geometrician；but his project was never put into practice, and up to the present day there is no bond in existence between the Earth and her satellite.It is reserved for the practical genius of Americans to establish a communication with the sidereal world.The means of arriving thither are simple, easy, certain, infallible—and that is the purpose of my present proposal.”

A storm of acclamations greeted these words. There was not a single person in the whole audience who was not overcome, carried away, lifted out of himself by the speaker's words！

As soon as the excitement had partially subsided, Barbicane resumed his speech in a somewhat graver voice.

“You know，”said he，“what progress artillery science has made during the last few years, and what a degree of perfection firearms of every kind have reached. Moreover, you are well aware that, in general terms, the resisting power of cannon and the expansive force of gunpowder are practically unlimited.Well！starting from this principle, I ask myself whether, supposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed upon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be possible to project a shot up to the moon?”

At these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand panting chests；then succeeded a moment of perfect silence, resembling that profound stillness which precedes the bursting of a thunderstorm. In point of fact, a thunderstorm did peal forth, but it was the thunder of applause, or cries, and of uproar which made the very hall tremble.The president attempted to speak, but could not.It was fully ten minutes before he could make himself heard.

“Suffer me to finish，”he calmly continued.“I have looked at the question in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it, and by incontrovertible calculations I find that a projectile endowed with an initial velocity of 12，000 yards per second, and aimed at the moon, must necessarily reach it. I have the honor, my brave colleagues, to propose a trial of this little experiment.”





Chapter III Effect of the President’s Communication


It is impossible to describe the effect produced by the last words of the honorable president—the cries, the shouts, the succession of roars, hurrahs, and all the varied vociferations which the American language is capable of supplying. It was a scene of indescribable confusion and uproar.They shouted, they clapped, they stamped on the floor of the hall.All the weapons in the museum discharged at once could not have more violently set in motion the waves of sound.One need not be surprised at this.There are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their own guns.

Barbicane remained calm in the midst of this enthusiastic clamor；perhaps he was desirous of addressing a few more words to his colleagues, for by his gestures he demanded silence, and his powerful alarum was worn out by its violent reports. No attention, however, was paid to his request.He was presently torn from his seat and passed from the hands of his faithful colleagues into the arms of a no less excited crowd.

Nothing can astound an American. It has often been asserted that the word“impossible”in not a French one.People have evidently been deceived by the dictionary.In America, all is easy, all is simple；and as for mechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise.Between Barbicane's proposition and its realization no true Yankee would have allowed even the semblance of a difficulty to be possible.A thing with them is no sooner said than done.

The triumphal progress of the president continued throughout the evening. It was a regular torchlight procession.Irish, Germans, French, Scotch, all the heterogeneous units which make up the population of Maryland shouted in their respective vernaculars；and the“vivas”，“hurrahs”，and“bravos”were intermingled in inexpressible enthusiasm.

Just at this crisis, as though she comprehended all this agitation regarding herself, the moon shone forth with serene splendor, eclipsing by her intense illumination all the surrounding lights. The Yankees all turned their gaze toward her resplendent orb, kissed their hands, called her by all kinds of endearing names.Between eight o'clock and midnight one optician in Jones'-Fall Street made his fortune by the sale of opera-glasses.

Midnight arrived, and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution. It spread equally among all classes of citizens—men of science, shopkeepers, merchants, porters, chair-men, as well as“greenhorns”，were stirred in their innermost fibres.A national enterprise was at stake.The whole city, high and low, the quays bordering the Patapsco, the ships lying in the basins, disgorged a crowd drunk with joy, gin, and whisky.Every one chattered, argued, discussed, disputed, applauded, from the gentleman lounging upon the barroom settee with his tumbler of sherry-cobbler before him down to the waterman who got drunk upon his“knock-me-down”in the dingy taverns of Fell Point.

About two A. M.，however, the excitement began to subside.President Barbicane reached his house, bruised, crushed, and squeezed almost to a mummy.Hercules could not have resisted a similar outbreak of enthusiasm.The crowd gradually deserted the squares and streets.The four railways from Philadelphia and Washington, Harrisburg and Wheeling, which converge at Baltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous population to the four corners of the United States, and the city subsided into comparative tranquility.

On the following day, thanks to the telegraphic wires, fifteen hundred newspapers and journals, daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly, all took up the question. They examined it under all its different aspects, physical, meteorological, economical, or moral, up to its bearings on politics or civilization.They debated whether the moon was a finished world, or whether it was destined to undergo any further transformation.Did it resemble the earth at the period when the latter was destitute as yet of an atmosphere?What kind of spectacle would its hidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid?Granting that the question at present was simply that of sending a projectile up to the moon, every one must see that that involved the commencement of a series of experiments.All must hope that some day America would penetrate the deepest secrets of that mysterious orb；and some even seemed to fear lest its conquest should not sensibly derange the equilibrium of Europe.

The project once under discussion, not a single paragraph suggested a doubt of its realization. All the papers, pamphlets, reports—all the journals published by the scientific, literary, and religious societies enlarged upon its advantages；and the Society of Natural History of Boston, the Society of Science and Art of Albany, the Geographical and Statistical Society of New York, the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and the Smithsonian of Washington sent innumerable letters of congratulation to the Gun Club, together with offers of immediate assistance and money.

From that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest citizens of the United States, a kind of Washington of science. A single trait of feeling, taken from many others, will serve to show the point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual attained.

Some few days after this memorable meeting of the Gun Club, the manager of an English company announced, at the Baltimore theatre, the production of“Much Ado about Nothing”. But the populace, seeing in that title an allusion damaging to Barbicane's project, broke into the auditorium, smashed the benches, and compelled the unlucky director to alter his playbill.Being a sensible man, he bowed to the public will and replaced the offending comedy by“As you like it”；and for many weeks he realized fabulous profits.





Chapter IV Reply from the Observatory of Cambridge


Barbicane, however, lost not one moment amid all the enthusiasm of which he had become the object. His first care was to reassemble his colleagues in the board-room of the Gun Club.There, after some discussion, it was agreed to consult the astronomers regarding the astronomical part of the enterprise.Their reply once ascertained, they could then discuss the mechanical means, and nothing should be wanting to ensure the success of this great experiment.

A note couched in precise terms, containing special interrogatories, was then drawn up and addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in Massachusetts. This city, where the first university of the United States was founded, is justly celebrated for its astronomical staff.There are to be found assembled all the most eminent men of science.Here is to be seen at work that powerful telescope which enabled Bond to resolve the nebula of Andromeda, and Clarke to discover the satellite of Sirius.This celebrated institution fully justified on all points the confidence reposed in it by the Gun Club.

So, after two days, the reply so impatiently awaited was placed in the hands of President Barbicane. It was couched in the following terms：

The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President of the Gun Club at Baltimore.

CAMBRIDGE, October 7.

On the receipt of your favor of the 6th instant, addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in the name of the members of the Baltimore Gun Club, our staff was immediately called together, and it was judged expedient to reply as follows：

The questions which have been proposed to it are these—

1.Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?

2.What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite?

3.What will be the period of transit of the projectile when endowed with sufficient initial velocity?And, consequently, at what moment ought it to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a particular point?

4.At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position to be reached by the projectile?

5.What point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at which is intended to discharge the projectile?

6.What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?

Regarding the first question，“Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?”

Answer.—Yes；provided it possess an initial velocity of 12，000 yards per second；calculations prove that to be sufficient. In proportion as we recede from the earth the action of gravitation diminishes in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance；that is to say, at three times a given distance the action is nine times less.Consequently, the weight of a shot will decrease, and will become reduced to zero at the instant that the attraction of the moon exactly counterpoises that of the earth；that is to say at 47/52 of its passage.At that instant the projectile will have no weight whatever；and, if it passes that point, it will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar attraction.The theoretical possibility of the experiment is therefore absolutely demonstrated；its success must depend upon the power of the engine employed.

As to the second question，“What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its satellite?”

Answer.—The moon does not describe a circle round the earth, but rather an ellipse, of which our earth occupies one of the foci；the consequence, therefore, is, that at certain times it approaches nearer to, and at others it recedes farther from, the earth；in astronomical language, it is at one time in apogee, at another in perigee. Now the difference between its greatest and its least distance is too considerable to be left out of consideration.In point of fact, in its apogee the moon is 247，552 miles, and in its perigee，218，657 miles only distant；a fact which makes a difference of 28，895 miles, or more than one-ninth of the entire distance.The perigee distance, therefore, is that which ought to serve as the basis of all calculations.

To the third question.

Answer.—If the shot should preserve continuously its initial velocity of 12，000 yards per second, it would require little more than nine hours to reach its destination；but, inasmuch as that initial velocity will be continually decreasing, it will occupy 300，000 seconds, that is 83hrs. 20m.in reaching the point where the attraction of the earth and moon will be in equilibrio.From this point it will fall into the moon in 50，000 seconds, or 13hrs.53m.20sec.It will be desirable, therefore, to discharge it 97hrs.13m.20sec.before the arrival of the moon at the point aimed at.

Regarding question four，“At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most favorable position, etc.?”

Answer.—After what has been said above, it will be necessary, first of all, to choose the period when the moon will be in perigee, and also the moment when she will be crossing the zenith, which latter event will further diminish the entire distance by a length equal to the radius of the earth, i. e.3，919 miles；the result of which will be that the final passage remaining to be accomplished will be 214，976 miles.But although the moon passes her perigee every month, she does not reach the zenith always at exactly the same moment.She does not appear under these two conditions simultaneously, except at long intervals of time.It will be necessary, therefore, to wait for the moment when her passage in perigee shall coincide with that in the zenith.Now, by a fortunate circumstance, on the 4th of December in the ensuing year the moon will present these two conditions.At midnight she will be in perigee, that is, at her shortest distance form the earth, and at the same moment she will be crossing the zenith.

On the fifth question，“At what point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed?”

Answer.—The preceding remarks being admitted, the cannon ought to be pointed to the zenith of the place. Its fire, therefore, will be perpendicular to the plane of the horizon；and the projectile will soonest pass beyond the range of the terrestrial attraction.But, in order that the moon should reach the zenith of a given place, it is necessary that the place should not exceed in latitude the declination of the luminary；in other words, it must be comprised within the degrees 0°and 28°of lat.N.or S.In every other spot the fire must necessarily be oblique, which would seriously militate against the success of the experiment.

As to the sixth question，“What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the projectile's departure?”

Answer.—At the moment when the projectile shall be discharged into space, the moon, which travels daily forward 13°10'35"，will be distant from the zenith point by four times that quantity, i. e.by 52°42'20"，a space which corresponds to the path which she will describe during the entire journey of the projectile.But, inasmuch as it is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the rotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot, and as the shot cannot reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the earth, which, calculated upon the moon's orbit, are equal to about eleven degrees, it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to those which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned：that is to say, in round numbers, about sixty-four degrees.Consequently, at the moment of firing the visual radius applied to the moon will describe, with the vertical line of the place, an angle of sixty-four degrees.

These are our answers to the questions proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge by the members of the Gun Club：

To sum up—

1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0°and 28°of N.or S.lat.

2nd. It ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place.

3rd. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of 12，000 yards per second.

4th. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs.46m.40sec.of the 1st of December of the ensuing year.

5th. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge, precisely at midnight on the 4th of December, at the moment of its transit across the zenith.

The members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, without delay, to commence the works necessary for such an experiment, and to be prepared to set to work at the moment determined upon；for, if they should suffer this 4th of December to go by, they will not find the moon again under the same conditions of perigee and of zenith until eighteen years and eleven days afterward.

The staff of the Cambridge Observatory place themselves entirely at their disposal in respect of all questions of theoretical astronomy；and herewith add their congratulations to those of all the rest of America.

Director of the Observatory of Cambridge.





Chapter V The Romance of the Moon


An observer endued with an infinite range of vision, and placed in that unknown center around which the entire world revolves, might have beheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of the universe. Little by little, as ages went on, a change took place；a general law of attraction manifested itself, to which the hitherto errant atoms became obedient：these atoms combined together chemically according to their affinities, formed themselves into molecules, and composed those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are strewed.These masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion around their own central point.This center, formed of indefinite molecules, began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual condensation；then, following the immutable laws of mechanics, in proportion as its bulk diminished by condensation, its rotary motion became accelerated, and these two effects continuing, the result was the formation of one principal star, the center of the nebulous mass.

By attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived the other molecules of the mass, following the example of this central star, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation, and gravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars. Thus was formed the Nebulae, of which astronomers have reckoned up nearly 5，000.

Among these 5，000 nebulae there is one which has received the name of the Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of which has become the center of a solar world.

If the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the more humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies, a star of the fourth class, that which is arrogantly called the Sun, all the phenomena to which the formation of the Universe is to be ascribed would have been successively fulfilled before his eyes. In fact, he would have perceived this sun, as yet in the gaseous state, and composed of moving molecules, revolving round its axis in order to accomplish its work of concentration.This motion, faithful to the laws of mechanics, would have been accelerated with the diminution of its volume；and a moment would have arrived when the centrifugal force would have overpowered the centripetal, which causes the molecules all to tend toward the center.

Another phenomenon would now have passed before the observer's eyes, and the molecules situated on the plane of the equator, escaping like a stone from a sling of which the cord had suddenly snapped, would have formed around the sun sundry concentric rings resembling that of Saturn. In their turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited by a rotary motion about the central mass, would have been broken up and decomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into planets.Similarly he would have observed these planets throw off one or more rings each, which became the origin of the secondary bodies which we call satellites.

Thus, then, advancing from atom to molecule, from molecule to nebulous mass, from that to principal star, from star to sun, from sun to planet, and hence to satellite, we have the whole series of transformations undergone by the heavenly bodies during the first days of the world.

Now, of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their elliptical orbits by the great law of gravitation, some few in turn possess satellites. Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter four, Neptune possibly three, and the Earth one.This last, one of the least important of the entire solar system, we call the Moon；and it is she whom the daring genius of the Americans professed their intention of conquering.

The moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly varying appearances produced by her several phases, has always occupied a considerable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth.

From the time of Thales of Miletus, in the fifth century B. C.，down to that of Copernicus in the fifteenth and Tycho Brahe in the sixteenth century A.D.，observations have been from time to time carried on with more or less correctness, until in the present day the altitudes of the lunar mountains have been determined with exactitude.Galileo explained the phenomena of the lunar light produced during certain of her phases by the existence of mountains, to which he assigned a mean altitude of 4，500 toises.After him Hevelius, an astronomer of Dantzic, reduced the highest elevations to 2，600 toises；but the calculations of Riccioli brought them up again to 7，000 toises.

At the close of the eighteenth century Herschel, armed with a powerful telescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements. He assigned a height of 1，900 toises to the maximum elevations, and reduced the mean of the different altitudes to little more than 400 toises.But Herschel's calculations were in their turn corrected by the observations of Halley, Nasmyth, Bianchini, Gruithuysen, and others；but it was reserved for the labors of Boeer and Maedler finally to solve the question.They succeeded in measuring 1，905 different elevations, of which six exceed 2，600 toises, and twenty-two exceed 2，400 toises.The highest summit of all towers to a height of 3，801 toises above the surface of the lunar disc.At the same period the examination of the moon was completed.She appeared completely riddled with craters, and her essentially volcanic character was apparent at each observation.By the absence of refraction in the rays of the planets occulted by her we conclude that she is absolutely devoid of an atmosphere.The absence of air entails the absence of water.It became, therefore, manifest that the Selenites, to support life under such conditions, must possess a special organization of their own, must differ remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth.

At length, thanks to modern art, instruments of still higher perfection searched the moon without intermission, not leaving a single point of her surface unexplored；and notwithstanding that her diameter measures 2，150 miles, her surface equals the one-thirteenth part of that of our globe, and her bulk the one-forty-ninth part of that of the terrestrial spheroid—not one of her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the astronomers；and these skillful men of science carried to an even greater degree their prodigious observations.

Thus they remarked that, during full moon, the disc appeared scored in certain parts with white lines；and, during the phases, with black. On prosecuting the study of these with still greater precision, they succeeded in obtaining an exact account of the nature of these lines.They were long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges, bordering generally upon the edges of the craters.Their length varied between ten and 100 miles, and their width was about 800 toises.Astronomers called them chasms, but they could not get any further.Whether these chasms were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not they were unable thoroughly to ascertain.

The Americans, among others, hoped one day or other to determine this geological question. They also undertook to examine the true nature of that system of parallel ramparts discovered on the moon's surface by Gruithuysen, a learned professor of Munich, who considered them to be“a system of fortifications thrown up by the Selenitic engineers”.These two points, yet obscure, as well as others, no doubt, could not be definitely settled except by direct communication with the moon.

Regarding the degree of intensity of its light, there was nothing more to learn on this point. It was known that it is 300，000 times weaker than that of the sun, and that its heat has no appreciable effect upon the thermometer.As to the phenomenon known as the“ashy light”，it is explained naturally by the effect of the transmission of the solar rays from the earth to the moon, which give the appearance of completeness to the lunar disc, while it presents itself under the crescent form during its first and last phases.

Such was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth's satellite, which the Gun Club undertook to perfect in all its aspects, cosmographic, geological, political, and moral.





Chapter VI Permissive Limits of Ignorance and Belief in the United States


The immediate result of Barbicane's proposition was to place upon the orders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the Queen of the Night. Everybody set to work to study assiduously.One would have thought that the moon had just appeared for the first time, and that no one had ever before caught a glimpse of her in the heavens.The papers revived all the old anecdotes in which the“sun of the wolves”played a part；they recalled the influences which the ignorance of past ages ascribed to her；in short, all America was seized with selenomania, or had become moon-mad.

The scientific journals, for their part, dealt more especially with the questions which touched upon the enterprise of the Gun Club. The letter of the Observatory of Cambridge was published by them, and commented upon with unreserved approval.

Until that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which the distance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated. They took advantage of this fact to explain to them that this distance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the moon.The term parallax proving“caviare to the general”，they further explained that it meant the angle formed by the inclination of two straight lines drawn from either extremity of the earth's radius to the moon.On doubts being expressed as to the correctness of this method, they immediately proved that not only was the mean distance 234，347 miles, but that astronomers could not possibly be in error in their estimate by more than seventy miles either way.

To those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being that of rotation upon her axis, the second being that of revolution round the earth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of time, that is to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days.

The motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the surface of the moon；save that there is only one day and one night in the lunar month, each lasting three hundred and fifty-four and one-third hours. But, happily for her, the face turned toward the terrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an intensity equal to that of fourteen moons.As to the other face, always invisible to us, it has of necessity three hundred and fifty-four hours of absolute night, tempered only by that“pale glimmer which falls upon it from the stars”.

Some well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not at first comprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself. To such they answered，“Go into your dining-room, and walk round the table in such a way as to always keep your face turned toward the center；by the time you will have achieved one complete round you will have completed one turn around yourself, since your eye will have traversed successively every point of the room.Well, then, the room is the heavens, the table is the earth, and the moon is yourself.”And they would go away delighted.

So, then the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth；nevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add that, in consequence of certain fluctuations of north and south, and of west and east, termed her libration, she permits rather more than half, that is to say, fifty-seven percent, to be seen.

As soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the director of the observatory himself knew, they began to worry themselves regarding her revolution round the earth, whereupon twenty scientific reviews immediately came to the rescue. They pointed out to them that the firmament, with its infinitude of stars, may be considered as one vast dial-plate, upon which the moon travels, indicating the true time to all the inhabitants of the earth；that it is during this movement that the Queen of Night exhibits her different phases；that the moon is full when she is in opposition with the sun, that is when the three bodies are on the same straight line, the earth occupying the center；that she is new when she is in conjunction with the sun, that is, when she is between it and the earth；and, lastly that she is in her first or last quarter, when she makes with the sun and the earth a right angle of which she herself occupies the apex.

Regarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon, the letter of the Cambridge Observatory had said all that was to be said in this respect. Every one knew that this altitude varies according to the latitude of the observer.But the only zones of the globe in which the moon passes the zenith, that is, the point directly over the head of the spectator, are of necessity comprised between the twenty-eighth parallels and the equator.Hence the importance of the advice to try the experiment upon some point of that part of the globe, in order that the projectile might be discharged perpendicularly, and so the soonest escape the action of gravitation.This was an essential condition to the success of the enterprise, and continued actively to engage the public attention.

Regarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round the earth, the Cambridge Observatory had demonstrated that this path is a re-entering curve, not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, of which the earth occupies one of the foci. It was also well understood that it is farthest removed from the earth during its apogee, and approaches most nearly to it at its perigee.

Such was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every American on the subject, and of which no one could decently profess ignorance. Still, while these principles were being rapidly disseminated many errors and illusory fears proved less easy to eradicate.

For instance, some worthy persons maintained that the moon was an ancient comet which, in describing its elongated orbit round the sun, happened to pass near the earth, and became confined within her circle of attraction. These drawing-room astronomers professed to explain the charred aspect of the moon—a disaster which they attributed to the intensity of the solar heat；only, on being reminded that comets have an atmosphere, and that the moon has little or none, they were fairly at a loss for a reply.

Others again, belonging to the doubting class, expressed certain fears as to the position of the moon. They had heard it said that, according to observations made in the time of the Caliphs, her revolution had become accelerated in a certain degree.Hence they concluded, logically enough, that an acceleration of motion ought to be accompanied by a corresponding diminution in the distance separating the two bodies；and that, supposing the double effect to be continued to infinity, the moon would end by one day falling into the earth.However, they became reassured as to the fate of future generations on being apprised that, according to the calculations of Laplace, this acceleration of motion is confined within very restricted limits, and that a proportional diminution of speed will be certain to succeed it.So, then, the stability of the solar system would not be deranged in ages to come.

There remains but the third class, the superstitious. These worthies were not content merely to rest in ignorance；they must know all about things which had no existence whatever, and as to the moon, they had long known all about her.One set regarded her disc as a polished mirror, by means of which people could see each other from different points of the earth and interchange their thoughts.Another set pretended that out of one thousand new moons that had been observed, nine hundred and fifty had been attended with remarkable disturbances, such as cataclysms, revolutions, earthquakes, the deluge, etc.Then they believed in some mysterious influence exercised by her over human destinies—that every Selenite was attached to some inhabitant of the earth by a tie of sympathy；they maintained that the entire vital system is subject to her control, etc.But in time the majority renounced these vulgar errors, and espoused the true side of the question.As for the Yankees, they had no other ambition than to take possession of this new continent of the sky, and to plant upon the summit of its highest elevation the star-spangled banner of the United States of America.





Chapter VII The Hymn of the Cannon-Ball


The Observatory of Cambridge in its memorable letter had treated the question from a purely astronomical point of view. The mechanical part still remained.

President Barbicane had, without loss of time, nominated a working committee of the Gun Club. The duty of this committee was to resolve the three grand questions of the cannon, the projectile, and the powder.It was composed of four members of great technical knowledge, Barbicane（with a casting vote in case of equality），General Morgan, Major Elphinstone, and J.T.Maston, to whom were confided the functions of secretary.On the 8th of October the committee met at the house of President Barbicane，3 Republican Street.The meeting was opened by the president himself.

“Gentlemen，”said he，“we have to resolve one of the most important problems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery. It might appear, perhaps, the most logical course to devote our first meeting to the discussion of the engine to be employed.Nevertheless, after mature consideration, it has appeared to me that the question of the projectile must take precedence of that of the cannon, and that the dimensions of the latter must necessarily depend on those of the former.”

“Suffer me to say a word，”here broke in J. T.Maston.Permission having been granted，“Gentlemen，”said he with an inspired accent，“our president is right in placing the question of the projectile above all others.The ball we are about to discharge at the moon is our ambassador to her, and I wish to consider it from a moral point of view.The cannon-ball, gentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent manifestation of human power.If Providence has created the stars and the planets, man has called the cannon-ball into existence.Let Providence claim the swiftness of electricity and of light, of the stars, the comets, and the planets, of wind and sound—we claim to have invented the swiftness of the cannon-ball, a hundred times superior to that of the swiftest horses or railway train.How glorious will be the moment when, infinitely exceeding all hitherto attained velocities, we shall launch our new projectile with the rapidity of seven miles a second！Shall it not, gentlemen—shall it not be received up there with the honors due to a terrestrial ambassador?”

Overcome with emotion the orator sat down and applied himself to a huge plate of sandwiches before him.

“And now，”said Barbicane，“let us quit the domain of poetry and come direct to the question.”

“By all means，”replied the members, each with his mouth full of sandwich.

“The problem before us，”continued the president，“is how to communicate to a projectile a velocity of 12，000 yards per second. Let us at present examine the velocities hitherto attained.General Morgan will be able to enlighten us on this point.”

“And the more easily，”replied the general，“that during the war I was a member of the committee of experiments. I may say, then, that the 100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance of 2，500 toises, impressed upon their projectile an initial velocity of 500 yards a second.The Rodman Columbiad threw a shot weighing half a ton a distance of six miles, with a velocity of 800 yards per second—a result which Armstrong and Palisser have never obtained in England.”

“This，”replied Barbicane，“is, I believe, the maximum velocity ever attained?”

“It is so，”replied the general.

“Ah！”groaned J. T.Maston，“if my mortar had not burst—”

“Yes，”quietly replied Barbicane，“but it did burst. We must take, then, for our starting point, this velocity of 800 yards.We must increase it twenty-fold.Now, reserving for another discussion the means of producing this velocity, I will call your attention to the dimensions which it will be proper to assign to the shot.You understand that we have nothing to do here with projectiles weighing at most but half a ton.”

“Why not?”demanded the major.

“Because the shot，”quickly replied J. T.Maston，“must be big enough to attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, if there are any?”

“Yes，”replied Barbicane，“and for another reason more important still.”

“What mean you?”asked the major.

“I mean that it is not enough to discharge a projectile, and then take no further notice of it；we must follow it throughout its course, up to the moment when it shall reach its goal.”

“What?”shouted the general and the major in great surprise.

“Undoubtedly，”replied Barbicane composedly，“or our experiment would produce no result.”

“But then，”replied the major，“you will have to give this projectile enormous dimensions.”

“No！Be so good as to listen. You know that optical instruments have acquired great perfection；with certain instruments we have succeeded in obtaining enlargements of 6，000 times and reducing the moon to within forty miles'distance.Now, at this distance, any objects sixty feet square would be perfectly visible.If, then, the penetrative power of telescopes has not been further increased, it is because that power detracts from their light；and the moon, which is but a reflecting mirror, does not give back sufficient light to enable us to perceive objects of lesser magnitude.”

“Well, then, what do you propose to do?”asked the general.“Would you give your projectile a diameter of sixty feet?”

“Not so.”

“Do you intend, then, to increase the luminous power of the moon?”

“Exactly so. If I can succeed in diminishing the density of the atmosphere through which the moon's light has to travel I shall have rendered her light more intense.To effect that object it will be enough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain.That is what we will do.”

“I give it up，”answered the major.“You have such a way of simplifying things. And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?”

“One of 48，000 times, which should bring the moon within an apparent distance of five miles；and, in order to be visible, objects need not have a diameter of more than nine feet.”

“So, then，”cried J. T.Maston，“our projectile need not be more than nine feet in diameter.”

“Let me observe, however，”interrupted Major Elphinstone，“this will involve a weight such as—”

“My dear major，”replied Barbicane，“before discussing its weight permit me to enumerate some of the marvels which our ancestors have achieved in this respect. I don't mean to pretend that the science of gunnery has not advanced, but it is as well to bear in mind that during the middle ages they obtained results more surprising, I will venture to say, than ours.For instance, during the siege of Constantinople by Mahomet II, in 1453，stone shot of 1，900 pounds weight were employed.At Malta, in the time of the knights, there was a gun of the fortress of St.Elmo which threw a projectile weighing 2，500 pounds.And, now, what is the extent of what we have seen ourselves?Armstrong guns discharging shot of 500 pounds, and the Rodman guns projectiles of half a ton！It seems, then, that if projectiles have gained in range, they have lost far more in weight.Now, if we turn our efforts in that direction, we ought to arrive, with the progress on science, at ten times the weight of the shot of Mahomet II and the Knights of Malta.”

“Clearly，”replied the major；“but what metal do you calculate upon employing?”

“Simply cast iron，”said General Mogran.

“But，”interrupted the major，“since the weight of a shot is proportionate to its volume, an iron ball of nine feet in diameter would be of tremendous weight.”

“Yes, if it were solid, not if it were hollow.”

“Hollow?then it would be a shell?”

“Yes, a shell，”replied Barbicane；“decidedly it must be. A solid shot of 108 inches would weigh more than 200，000 pounds, a weight evidently far too great.Still, as we must reserve a certain stability for our projectile, I propose to give it a weight of 5，000 pounds.”

“What, then, will be the thickness of the sides?”asked the major.

“If we follow the usual proportion，”replied Mogran，“a diameter of 108 inches would require sides of two feet thickness, or less.”

“That would be too much，”replied Barbicane；“for you will observe that the question is not that of a shot intended to pierce an iron plate；it will suffice to give it sides strong enough to resist the pressure of the gas. The problem, therefore, is this—What thickness ought a cast-iron shell to have in order not to weight more than 20，000 pounds?Our clever secretary will soon enlighten us upon this point.”

“Nothing easier，”replied the worthy secretary of the committee. And, rapidly tracing a few algebraical formulae upon paper, among which π2 and x 2 frequently appeared, he presently said：“The sides will require a thickness of less than two inches.”

“Will that be enough?”asked the major doubtfully.

“Clearly not！”replied the president.

“What is to be done, then?”said Elphinstone, with a puzzled air.

“Employ another metal instead of iron.”

“Copper?”said Morgan.

“No！that would be too heavy. I have better than that to offer.”

“What then?”asked the major.

“Aluminum！”replied Barbicane.

“Aluminum?”cried his three colleagues in chorus.

“Unquestionably, my friends. This valuable metal possesses the whiteness of silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity of iron, the fusibility of copper, the lightness of glass.It is easily wrought, is very widely distributed, forming the base of most of the rocks, is three times lighter than iron, and seems to have been created for the express purpose of furnishing us with the material for our projectile.”

“But, my dear president，”said the major，“is not the cost price of aluminum extremely high?”

“It was so at its first discovery, but it has fallen now to nine dollars a pound.”

“But still, nine dollars a pound！”replied the major, who was not willing readily to give in；“even that is an enormous price.”

“Undoubtedly, my dear major；but not beyond our reach.”

“What will the projectile weigh then?”asked Mogran.

“Here is the result of my calculations，”replied Barbicane.“A shot of 108 inches in diameter, and twelve inches in thickness, would weigh, in cast-iron，67，440 pounds；cast in aluminum, its weight will be reduced to 19，250 pounds.”

“Capital！”cried the major；“but do you know that, at nine dollars a pound, this projectile will cost—”

“One hundred and seventy-three thousand and two hundred and fifty dollars（$173，250）. I know it quite well.But fear not, my friends；the money will not be wanting for our enterprise.I will answer for it.Now what say you to aluminum, gentlemen?”

“Adopted！”replied the three members of the committee. So ended the first meeting.The question of the projectile was definitely settled.





Chapter VIII History of the Cannon


The resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great effect out of doors. Timid people took fright at the idea of a shot weighing 20，000 pounds being launched into space；they asked what cannon could ever transmit a sufficient velocity to such a mighty mass.The minutes of the second meeting were destined triumphantly to answer such questions.

“My dear colleagues，”said Barbicane, without further preamble，“the subject now before us is the construction of the engine, its length, its composition, and its weight. It is probable that we shall end by giving it gigantic dimensions；but however great may be the difficulties in the way, our mechanical genius will readily surmount them.Be good enough, then, to give me your attention, and do not hesitate to make objections at the close.I have no fear of them.The problem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12，000 yards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter, weighing 20，000 pounds.Now when a projectile is launched into space, what happens to it?It is acted upon by three independent forces：the resistance of the air, the attraction of the earth, and the force of impulsion with which it is endowed.Let us examine these three forces.The resistance of the air is of little importance.The atmosphere of the earth does not exceed forty miles.Now, with the given rapidity, the projectile will have traversed this in five seconds, and the period is too brief for the resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise than as insignificant.Proceding, then, to the attraction of the earth, that is, the weight of the shell, we know that this weight will diminish in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance.When a body left to itself falls to the surface of the earth, it falls fifteen feet in the first second；and if the same body were removed 257，542 miles further off, in other words, to the distance of the moon, its fall would be reduced to about half a line in the first second.That is almost equivalent to a state of perfect rest.Our business, then, is to overcome progressively this action of gravitation.The mode of accomplishing that is by the force of impulsion.”

“There's the difficulty，”broke in the major.

“True，”replied the president；“but we will overcome that, for the force of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine and the powder employed, the latter being limited only by the resisting power of the former. Our business, then, today is with the dimensions of the cannon.”

“Now, up to the present time，”said Barbicane，“our longest guns have not exceeded twenty-five feet in length. We shall therefore astonish the world by the dimensions we shall be obliged to adopt.It must evidently be, then, a gun of great range, since the length of the piece will increase the detention of the gas accumulated behind the projectile；but there is no advantage in passing certain limits.”

“Quite so，”said the major.“What is the rule in such a case?”

“Ordinarily the length of a gun is twenty to twenty-five times the diameter of the shot, and its weight two hundred and thirty-five to two hundred and forty times that of the shot.”

“That is not enough，”cried J. T.Maston impetuously.

“I agree with you, my good friend；and, in fact, following this proportion for a projectile nine feet in diameter, weighing 30，000 pounds, the gun would only have a length of two hundred and twenty-five feet, and a weight of 7，200，000 pounds.”

“Ridiculous！”rejoined J. T.Maston.“As well take a pistol.”

“I think so too，”replied Barbicane；“that is why I propose to quadruple that length, and to construct a gun of nine hundred feet.”

The general and the major offered some objections；nevertheless, the proposition, actively supported by the secretary, was definitely adopted.

“But，”said Elphinstone，“what thickness must we give it?”

“A thickness of six feet，”replied Barbicane.

“You surely don't think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?”asked the major.

“It would be a superb idea, though，”said J. T.Maston.

“But impracticable，”replied Barbicane.“No, I think of sinking this engine in the earth alone, binding it with hoops of wrought iron, and finally surrounding it with a thick mass of masonry of stone and cement. The piece once cast, it must be bored with great precision, so as to preclude any possible windage.So there will be no loss whatever of gas, and all the expansive force of the powder will be employed in the propulsion.”

“One simple question，”said Elphinstone；“is our gun to be rifled?”

“No, certainly not，”replied Barbicane；“we require an enormous initial velocity；and you are well aware that a shot quits a rifled gun less rapidly than it does a smooth-bore.”

“True，”rejoined the major.

The committee here adjourned for a few minutes to tea and sandwiches, the discussion being renewed.

“Gentlemen，”said Barbicane，“we must now take into consideration the metal to be employed. Our cannon must be possessed of great tenacity, great hardness, be infusible by heat, indissoluble, and inoxidable by the corrosive action of acids.”

“There is no doubt about that，”replied the major；“and as we shall have to employ an immense quantity of metal, we shall not be at a loss for choice.”

“Well, then，”said Morgan，“I propose the best alloy hitherto known, which consists of one hundred parts of copper, twelve of tin, and six of brass.”

“I admit，”replied the president，“that this composition has yielded excellent results, but in the present case it would be too expensive, and very difficult to work. I think, then, that we ought to adopt a material excellent in its way and of low price, such as cast iron.What is your advice, major?”

“I quite agree with you，”replied Elphinstone.

“In fact，”continued Barbicane，“cast iron costs ten times less than bronze；it is easy to cast, it runs readily from the moulds of sand, it is easy of manipulation, it is at once economical of money and of time. In addition, it is excellent as a material, and I well remember that during the war, at the siege of Atlanta, some iron guns fired one thousand rounds at intervals of twenty minutes without injury.”

“Cast iron is very brittle, though，”replied Mogran.

“Yes, but it possesses great resistance. I will now ask our worthy secretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron gun with a bore of nine feet and a thickness of six feet of metal.”

“In a moment，”replied J. T.Maston.Then, dashing off some algebraical formulae with marvelous facility, in a minute or two he declared the following result：

“The cannon will weigh 68，040 tons. And, at two cents a pound, it will cost—”

“Two million five hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and one dollars.”

J. T.Maston, the major, and the general regarded Barbicane with uneasy looks.

“Well, gentlemen，”replied the president，“I repeat what I said yesterday. Make yourselves easy；the millions will not be wanting.”

With this assurance of their president the committee separated, after having fixed their third meeting for the following evening.





Chapter IX The Question of the Powders


There remained for consideration merely the question of powders. The public awaited with interest its final decision.The size of the projectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what would be the quantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?

It is generally asserted that gunpowder was invented in the fourteenth century by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his grand discovery with his life. It is, however, pretty well proved that this story ought to be ranked among the legends of the middle ages.Gunpowder was not invented by any one；it was the lineal successor of the Greek fire, which, like itself, was composed of sulfur and saltpeter.Few persons are acquainted with the mechanical power of gunpowder.Now this is precisely what is necessary to be understood in order to comprehend the importance of the question submitted to the committee.

A litre of gunpowder weighs about two pounds；during combustion it produces 400 litres of gas. This gas, on being liberated and acted upon by temperature raised to 2，400 degrees, occupies a space of 4，000 litres：consequently the volume of powder is to the volume of gas produced by its combustion as 1 to 4，000.One may judge, therefore, of the tremendous pressure on this gas when compressed within a space 4，000 times too confined.All this was, of course, well known to the members of the committee when they met on the following evening.

The first speaker on this occasion was Major Elphinstone, who had been the director of the gunpowder factories during the war.

“Gentlemen，”said this distinguished chemist，“I begin with some figures which will serve as the basis of our calculation. The old 24-pounder shot required for its discharge sixteen pounds of powder.”

“You are certain of this amount?”broke in Barbiacne.

“Quite certain，”replied the major.“The Armstrong cannon employs only seventy-five pounds of powder for a projectile of eight hundred pounds, and the Rodman Columbiad uses only one hundred and sixty pounds of powder to send its half ton shot a distance of six miles. These facts cannot be called in question, for I myself raised the point during the depositions taken before the committee of artillery.”

“Quite true，”said the general.

“Well，”replied the major，“these figures go to prove that the quantity of powder is not increased with the weight of the shot；that is to say, if a 24-pounder shot requires sixteen pounds of powder；—in other words, if in ordinary guns we employ a quantity of powder equal to two-thirds of the weight of the projectile, this proportion is not constant. Calculate, and you will see that in place of three hundred and thirty-three pounds of powder, the quantity is reduced to no more than one hundred and sixty pounds.”

“What are you aiming at?”asked the president.

“If you push your theory to extremes, my dear major，”said J. T.Maston，“you will get to this, that as soon as your shot becomes sufficiently heavy you will not require any powder at all.”

“Our friend J. T.Maston is always at his jokes, even in serious matters，”cried the major；“but let him make his mind easy, I am going presently to propose gunpowder enough to satisfy his artillerist's propensities.I only keep to statistical facts when I say that, during the war, and for the very largest guns, the weight of the powder was reduced, as the result of experience, to a tenth part of the weight of the shot.”

“Perfectly correct，”said Morgan；“but before deciding the quantity of powder necessary to give the impulse, I think it would be as well—”

“We shall have to employ a large-grained powder，”continued the major；“its combustion is more rapid than that of the small.”

“No doubt about that，”replied Morgan；“but it is very destructive, and ends by enlarging the bore of the pieces.”

“Granted；but that which is injurious to a gun destined to perform long service is not so to our Columbiad. We shall run no danger of an explosion；and it is necessary that our powder should take fire instantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete.”

“We must have，”said J. T.Maston，“several touch-holes, so as to fire it at different points at the same time.”

“Certainly，”replied Elphinstone；“but that will render the working of the piece more difficult. I return then to my large-grained powder, which removes those difficulties.In his Columbiad charges Rodman employed a powder as large as chestnuts, made of willow charcoal, simply dried in cast-iron pans.This powder was hard and glittering, left no trace upon the hand, contained hydrogen and oxygen in large proportion, took fire instantaneously, and, though very destructive, did not sensibly injure the mouth-piece.”

Up to this point Barbicane had kept aloof from the discussion；he left the others to speak while he himself listened；he had evidently got an idea. He now simply said，“Well, my friends, what quantity of powder do you propose?”

The three members looked at one another.

“Two hundred thousand pounds，”at last said Morgan.

“Five hundred thousand，”added the major.

“Eight hundred thousand，”screamed J. T.Maston.

A moment of silence followed this triple proposal；it was at last broken by the president.

“Gentlemen，”he quietly said，“I start from this principle, that the resistance of a gun, constructed under the given conditions, is unlimited. I shall surprise our friend J.T.Maston, then, by stigmatizing his calculations as timid；and I propose to double his 800，000 pounds of powder.”

“Sixteen hundred thousand pounds?”shouted J. T.Maston, leaping from his seat.

“Just so.”

“We shall have to come then to my ideal of a cannon half a mile long；for you see 1，600，000 pounds will occupy a space of about 22，000 cubic feet；and since the contents of your cannon do not exceed 54，000 cubic feet, it would be half full；and the bore will not be more than long enough for the gas to communicate to the projectile sufficient impulse.”

“Nevertheless，”said the president，“I hold to that quantity of powder. Now，1，600，000 pounds of powder will create 6，000，000，000 litres of gas.Six thousand millions！You quite understand?”

“What is to be done then?”said the general.

“The thing is very simple；we must reduce this enormous quantity of powder while preserving to it its mechanical power.”

“Good；but by what means?”

“I am going to tell you，”replied Barbicane quietly.

“Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its bulk. You know that curious cellular matter which constitutes the elementary tissues of vegetable?This substance is found quite pure in many bodies, especially in cotton, which is nothing more than the down of the seeds of the cotton plant.Now cotton, combined with cold nitric acid, become transformed into a substance eminently insoluble, combustible, and explosive.It was first discovered in 1832，by Braconnot, a French chemist, who called it xyloidine.In 1838 another Frenchman, Pelouze, investigated its different properties, and finally, in 1846，Schonbein, professor of chemistry at Bâle, proposed its employment for purposes of war.This powder, now called pyroxyle, or fulminating cotton, is prepared with great facility by simply plunging cotton for fifteen minutes in nitric acid, then washing it in water, then drying it, and it is ready for use.”

“Nothing could be more simple，”said Morgan.

“Moreover, pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture—a valuable property to us, inasmuch as it would take several days to charge the cannon. It ignites at 170 degrees in place of 240，and its combustion is so rapid that one may set light to it on the top of the ordinary powder, without the latter having time to ignite.”

“Perfect！”exclaimed the major.

“Only it is more expensive.”

“What matter?”cried J. T.Maston.

“Finally, it imparts to projectiles a velocity four times superior to that of gunpowder. I will even add, that if we mix it with eight-tenths of its own weight of nitrate of potassium, its expansive force is again considerably augmented.”

“Will that be necessary?”asked the major.

“I think not，”replied Barbicane.“So, then, in place of 1，600，000 pounds of powder, we shall have but 400，000 pounds of fulminating cotton；and since we can, without danger, compress 500 pounds of cotton into twenty-seven cubic feet, the whole quantity will not occupy a height of more than 30 toises within the bore of the Columbiad. In this way the shot will have more than 700 feet of bore to traverse under a force of 6，000，000，000 litres of gas before taking its flight toward the moon.”

At this juncture J. T.Maston could not repress his emotion；he flung himself into the arms of his friend with the violence of a projectile, and Barbicane would have been stove in if he had not been boom-proof.

This incident terminated the third meeting of the committee.

Barbicane and his bold colleagues, to whom nothing seemed impossible, had succeeding in solving the complex problems of projectile, cannon, and powder. Their plan was drawn up, and it only remained to put it into execution.

“A mere matter of detail, a bagatelle，”said J. T.Maston.





Chapter X One Enemy v.Twenty-Five Millions of Friends


The American public took a lively interest in the smallest details of the enterprise of the Gun Club. It followed day by day the discussion of the committee.The most simple preparations for the great experiment, the questions of figures which it involved, the mechanical difficulties to be resolved—in one word, the entire plan of work—roused the popular excitement to the highest pitch.

The purely scientific attraction was suddenly intensified by the following incident：

We have seen what legions of admirers and friends Barbicane's project had rallied round its author. There was, however, one single individual alone in all the States of the Union who protested against the attempt of the Gun Club.He attacked it furiously on every opportunity, and human nature is such that Barbicane felt more keenly the opposition of that one man than he did the applause of all the others.He was well aware of the motive of this antipathy, the origin of this solitary enmity, the cause of its personality and old standing, and in what rivalry of self-love it had its rise.

This persevering enemy the president of the Gun Club had never seen. Fortunate that it was so, for a meeting between the two men would certainly have been attended with serious consequences.This rival was a man of science, like Barbicane himself, of a fiery, daring, and violent disposition；a pure Yankee.His name was Captain Nicholl；he lived at Philadelphia.

Most people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during the Federal war between the guns and armor of iron-plated ships. The result was the entire reconstruction of the navy of both the continents；as the one grew heavier, the other became thicker in proportion.The Merrimac, the Monitor, the Tennessee, the Weehawken discharged enormous projectiles themselves, after having been armor-clad against the projectiles of others.In fact they did to others that which they would not they should do to them—that grand principle of immortality upon which rests the whole art of war.

Now if Barbicane was a great founder of shot, Nicholl was a great forger of plates；the one cast night and day at Baltimore, the other forged day and night at Philadelphia. As soon as ever Barbicane invented a new shot, Nicholl invented a new plate；each followed a current of ideas essentially opposed to the other.Happily for these citizens, so useful to their country, a distance of from fifty to sixty miles separated them from one another, and they had never yet met.Which of these two inventors had the advantage over the other it was difficult to decide from the results obtained.By last accounts, however, it would seem that the armor-plate would in the end have to give way to the shot；nevertheless, there were competent judges who had their doubts on the point.

At the last experiment the cylindro-conical projectiles of Barbicane stuck like so many pins in the Nicholl plates. On that day the Philadelphia iron-forger then believed himself victorious, and could not evince contempt enough for his rival；but when the other afterward substituted for conical shot simple 600-pound shells, at very moderate velocity, the captain was obliged to give in.In fact, these projectiles knocked his best metal plate to shivers.

Matters were at this stage, and victory seemed to rest with the shot, when the war came to an end on the very day when Nicholl had completed a new armor-plate of wrought steel. It was a masterpiece of its kind, and bid defiance to all the projectiles of the world.The captain had it conveyed to the Polygon at Washington, challenging the president of the Gun Club to break it.Barbicane, peace having been declared, declined to try the experiment.

Nicholl, now furious, offered to expose his plate to the shock of any shot, solid, hollow, round, or conical. Refused by the president, who did not choose to compromise his last success.

Nicholl, disgusted by this obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane by offering him every chance. He proposed to fix the plate within two hundred yards of the gun.Barbicane still obstinate in refusal.A hundred yards?Not even seventy-five！

“At fifty then！”roared the captain through the newspapers.“At twenty-five yards！and I'll stand behind！”

Barbicane returned for answer that, even if Captain Nicholl would be so good as to stand in front, he would not fire any more.

Nicholl could not contain himself at this reply；threw out hints of cowardice；that a man who refused to fire a cannon-shot was pretty near being afraid of it；that artillerists who fight at six miles distance are substituting mathematical formulae for individual courage.

To these insinuations Barbicane returned no answer；perhaps he never heard of them, so absorbed was he in the calculations for his great enterprise.

When his famous communication was made to the Gun Club, the captain's wrath passed all bounds；with his intense jealousy was mingled a feeling of absolute impotence. How was he to invent anything to beat this 900-feet Columbiad?What armor-plate could ever resist a projectile of 20，000 pounds weight?Overwhelmed at first under this violent shock, he by and by recovered himself, and resolved to crush the proposal by weight of his arguments.

He then violently attacked the labors of the Gun Club, published a number of letters in the newspapers, endeavored to prove Barbicane ignorant of the first principles of gunnery. He maintained that it was absolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of 12，000 yards per second；that even with such a velocity a projectile of such a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth's atmosphere.Further still, even regarding the velocity to be acquired, and granting it to be sufficient, the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas developed by the ignition of 1，600，000 pounds of powder；and supposing it to resist that pressure, it would be less able to support that temperature；it would melt on quitting the Columbiad, and fall back in a red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators.

Barbicane continued his work without regarding these attacks.

Nicholl then took up the question in its other aspects. Without touching upon its uselessness in all points of view, he regarded the experiment as fraught with extreme danger, both to the citizens, who might sanction by their presence so reprehensible a spectacle, and also to the towns in the neighborhood of this deplorable cannon.He also observed that if the projectile did not succeed in reaching its destination（a result absolutely impossible），it must inevitably fall back upon the earth, and that the shock of such a mass, multiplied by the square of its velocity, would seriously endanger every point of the globe.Under the circumstances, therefore, and without interfering with the rights of free citizens, it was a case for the intervention of Government, which ought not to endanger the safety of all for the pleasure of one individual.

In spite of all his arguments, however, Captain Nicholl remained alone in his opinion. Nobody listened to him, and he did not succeed in alienating a single admirer from the president of the Gun Club.The latter did not even take the pains to refute the arguments of his rival.

Nicholl, driven into his last entrenchments, and not able to fight personally in the cause, resolved to fight with money. He published, therefore, in the Richmond Inquirer a series of wagers, conceived in these terms, and on an increasing scale：

No. 1（$1，000）.—That the necessary funds for the experiment of the Gun Club will not be forthcoming.

No. 2（$2，000）.—That the operation of casting a cannon of 900 feet is impracticable, and cannot possibly succeed.

No. 3（$3，000）.—That is it impossible to load the Columbiad, and that the pyroxyle will take fire spontaneously under the pressure of the projectile.

No. 4（$4，000）.—That the Columbiad will burst at the first fire.

No. 5（$5，000）.—That the shot will not travel farther than six miles, and that it will fall back again a few seconds after its discharge.

It was an important sum, therefore, which the captain risked in his invincible obstinacy. He had no less than$15，000 at stake.

Notwithstanding the importance of the challenge, on the 19th of May he received a sealed packet containing the following superbly laconic reply：

BALTIMORE, October 19.

Done.

BARBICANE.





Chapter XI Florida and Texas


One question remained yet to be decided；it was necessary to choose a favorable spot for the experiment. According to the advice of the Observatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired perpendicularly to the plane of the horizon, that is to say, toward the zenith.Now the moon does not traverse the zenith, except in places situated between 0°and 28°of latitude.It became, then, necessary to determine exactly that spot on the globe where the immense Columbiad should be cast.

On the 20th of October, at a general meeting of the Gun Club, Barbicane produced a magnificent map of the United States.“Gentlemen，”said he, in opening the discussion，“I presume that we are all agreed that this experiment cannot and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the limits of the soil of the Union. Now, by good fortune, certain frontiers of the United States extend downward as far as the 28th parallel of the north latitude.If you will cast your eye over this map, you will see that we have at our disposal the whole of the southern portion of Texas and Florida.”

It was finally agreed, then, that the Columbiad must be cast on the soil of either Texas or Florida. The result, however, of this decision was to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the different towns of these two States.

The 28th parallel, on reaching the American coast, traverses the peninsula of Florida, dividing it into two nearly equal portions. Then, plunging into the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc formed by the coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana；then skirting Texas, off which it cuts an angle, it continues its course over Mexico, crosses the Sonora, Old California, and loses itself in the Pacific Ocean.It was, therefore, only those portions of Texas and Florida which were situated below this parallel which came within the prescribed conditions of latitude.

Florida, in its southern part, reckons no cities of importance；it is simply studded with forts raised against the roving Indians. One solitary town, Tampa Town, was able to put in a claim in favor of its situation.

In Texas, on the contrary, the towns are much more numerous and important. Corpus Christi, in the county of Nueces, and all the cities situated on the Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San Ignacio on the Web, Rio Grande City on the Starr, Edinburgh in the Hidalgo, Santa Rita, Elpanda, Brownsville in the Cameron, formed an imposing league against the pretensions of Florida.So, scarcely was the decision known, when the Texan and Floridan deputies arrived at Baltimore in an incredibly short space of time.From that very moment President Barbicane and the influential members of the Gun Club were besieged day and night by formidable claims.If seven cities of Greece contended for the honor of having given birth to a Homer, here were two entire States threatening to come to blows about the question of a cannon.

The rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands；and at every occasion of their meeting a collision was to be apprehended which might have been attended with disastrous results. Happily the prudence and address of President Barbicane averted the danger.These personal demonstrations found a division in the newspapers of the different States.The New York Herald and the Tribune supported Texas, while the Times and the American Review espoused the cause of the Floridan deputies.The members of the Gun Club could not decide to which to give the preference.

Texas produced its array of twenty-six counties；Florida replied that twelve counties were better than twenty-six in a country only one-sixth part of the size.

Texas plumed itself upon its 330，000 natives；Florida, with a far smaller territory, boasted of being much more densely populated with 56，000.

The Texans, through the columns of the Herald claimed that some regard should be had to a State which grew the best cotton in all America, produced the best green oak for the service of the navy, and contained the finest coal, besides iron mines, in which the yield was fifty percent of pure metal.

To this the American Review replied that the soil of Florida, although not equally rich, afforded the best conditions for the moulding and casting of the Columbiad, consisting as it did of sand and argillaceous earth.

“That may be all very well，”replied the Texans；“but you must first get to this country. Now the communications with Florida are difficult, while the coast of Texas offers the bay of Galveston, which possesses a circumference of fourteen leagues, and is capable of containing the navies of the entire world！”

“A pretty notion truly，”replied the papers in the interest of Florida，“that of Galveston bay below the 29th parallel！Have we not got the bay of Espiritu Santo, opening precisely upon the 28th degree, and by which ships can reach Tampa Town by direct route?”

“A fine bay；half choked with sand！”

“Choked yourselves！”returned the others.

Thus the war went on for several days, when Florida endeavored to draw her adversary away on to fresh ground；and one morning the Times hinted that, the enterprise being essentially American, it ought not to be attempted upon other than purely American territory.

To these words Texas retorted，“American！are we not as much so as you?Were not Texas and Florida both incorporated into the Union in 1845?”

“Undoubtedly，”replied the Times；“but we have belonged to the Americans ever since 1820.”

“Yes！”returned the Tribune；“after having been Spaniards or English for two hundred years, you were sold to the United States for five million dollars！”

“Well！and why need we blush for that?Was not Louisiana bought from Napoleon in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars?”

“Scandalous！”roared the Texas deputies.“A wretched little strip of country like Florida to dare to compare itself to Texas, who, in place of selling herself, asserted her own independence, drove out the Mexicans in March 2，1836，and declared herself a federal republic after the victory gained by Samuel Houston, on the banks of the San Jacinto, over the troops of Santa Anna！—a country, in fine, which voluntarily annexed itself to the United States of America！”

“Yes；because it was afraid of the Mexicans！”replied Florida.

“Afraid！”From this moment the state of things became intolerable. A sanguinary encounter seemed daily imminent between the two parties in the streets of Baltimore.It became necessary to keep an eye upon the deputies.

President Barbicane knew not which way to look. Notes, documents, letters full of menaces showered down upon his house.Which side ought he to take?As regarded the appropriation of the soil, the facility of communication, the rapidity of transport, the claims of both States were evenly balanced.As for political prepossessions, they had nothing to do with the question.

This dead block had existed for some little time, when Barbicane resolved to get rid of it all at once. He called a meeting of his colleagues, and laid before them a proposition which, it will be seen, was profoundly sagacious.

“On carefully considering，”he said，“what is going on now between Florida and Texas, it is clear that the same difficulties will recur with all the towns of the favored State. The rivalry will descend from State to city, and so on downward.Now Texas possesses eleven towns within the prescribed conditions, which will further dispute the honor and create us new enemies, while Florida has only one.I go in, therefore, for Florida and Tampa Town.”

This decision, on being made known, utterly crushed the Texan deputies. Seized with an indescribable fury, they addressed threatening letters to the different members of the Gun Club by name.The magistrates had but one course to take, and they took it.They chartered a special train, forced the Texans into it whether they would or no；and they quitted the city with a speed of thirty miles an hour.

Quickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to hurl one last and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries.

Alluding to the extent of Florida, a mere peninsula confined between two seas, they pretended that it could never sustain the shock of the discharge, and that it would“bust up”at the very first shot.

“Very well, let it bust up！”replied the Floridans, with a brevity of the days of ancient Sparta.





Chapter XII From Country to World


The astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties resolved, finally came the question of finance. The sum required was far too great for any individual, or even any single State, to provide the requisite millions.

President Barbicane undertook, despite of the matter being a purely American affair, to render it one of universal interest, and to request the financial cooperation of all peoples. It was, he maintained, the right and duty of the whole earth to interfere in the affairs of its satellite.The subscription opened at Baltimore extended properly to the whole world—Urbi et orbi.

This subscription was successful beyond all expectation；notwithstanding that it was a question not of lending but of giving the money. It was a purely disinterested operation in the strictest sense of the term, and offered not the slightest chance of profit.

The effect, however, of Barbicane's communication was not confined to the frontiers of the United States；it crossed the Atlantic and Pacific, invading simultaneously Asia and Europe, Africa and Oceanica. The observatories of the Union placed themselves in immediate communication with those of foreign countries.Some, such as those of Paris, Petersburg, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares, Madras, and others, transmitted their good wishes；the rest maintained a prudent silence, quietly awaiting the result.As for the observatory at Greenwich, seconded as it was by the twenty-two astronomical establishments of Great Britain, it spoke plainly enough.It boldly denied the possibility of success, and pronounced in favor of the theories of Captain Nicholl.But this was nothing more than mere English jealousy.

On the 8th of October President Barbicane published a manifesto full of enthusiasm, in which he made an appeal to“all persons of good will upon the face of the earth”. This document, translated into all languages, met with immense success.

Subscription lists were opened in all the principal cities of the Union, with a central office at the Baltimore Bank，9 Baltimore Street.

In addition, subscriptions were received at the following banks in the different states of the two continents：

At Vienna, with S. M.de Rothschild.

At Petersburg, Stieglitz and Co.

At Paris, The Credit Mobilier.

At Stockholm, Tottie and Arfuredson.

At London, N. M.Rothschild and Son.

At Turin, Ardouin and Co.

At Berlin, Mendelssohn.

At Geneva, Lombard, Odier and Co.

At Constantinople, the Ottoman Bank.

At Brussels, J. Lambert.

At Madrid, Daniel Weisweller.

At Amsterdam, Netherlands Credit Co.

At Rome, Torlonia and Co.

At Lisbon, Lecesne.

At Copenhagen, Private Bank.

At Rio de Janeiro, Private Bank.

At Montevideo, Private Bank.

At Valparaiso, Thomas la Chambre and Co.

At Mexico, Martin Daran and Co.

Three days after the manifesto of President Barbicane$4，000，000 were paid into the different towns of the Union. With such a balance the Gun Club might begin operations at once.But some days later advices were received to the effect that foreign subscriptions were being eagerly taken up.Certain countries distinguished themselves by their liberality；others untied their purse-strings with less facility—a matter of temperament.Figures are, however, more eloquent than words, and here is the official statement of the sums which were paid in to the credit of the Gun Club at the close of the subscription.

Russia paid in as her contingent the enormous sum of 368，733 roubles. No one need be surprised at this, who bears in mind the scientific taste of the Russians, and the impetus which they have given to astronomical studies—thanks to their numerous observatories.

France began by deriding the pretensions of the Americans. The moon served as a pretext for a thousand stale puns and a score of ballads, in which bad taste contested the palm with ignorance.But as formerly the French paid before singing, so now they paid after having had their laugh, and they subscribed for a sum of 1，253，930 francs.At that price they had a right to enjoy themselves a little.

Austria showed herself generous in the midst of her financial crisis. Her public contributions amounted to the sum of 216，000 florins—a perfect godsend.

Fifty-two thousand rix-dollars were the remittance of Sweden and Norway；the amount is large for the country, but it would undoubtedly have been considerably increased had the subscription been opened in Christiana simultaneously with that at Stockholm. For some reason or other the Norwegians do not like to send their money to Sweden.

Prussia, by a remittance of 250，000 thalers, testified her high approval of the enterprise.

Turkey behaved generously；but she had a personal interest in the matter. The moon, in fact, regulates the cycle of her years and her fast of Ramadan.She could not do less than give 1，372，640 piastres；and she gave them with an eagerness which denoted, however, some pressure on the part of the government.

Belgium distinguished herself among the second-rate states by a grant of 513，000 francs—about two centimes per head of her population.

Holland and her colonies interested themselves to the extent of 110，000 florins, only demanding an allowance of five percent discount for paying ready money.

Denmark, a little contracted in territory, gave nevertheless 9，000 ducats, proving her love for scientific experiments.

The Germanic Confederation pledged itself to 34，285 florins. It was impossible to ask for more；besides, they would not have given it.

Though very much crippled, Italy found 200，000 lire in the pockets of her people. If she had had Venetia she would have done better；but she had not.

The States of the Church thought that they could not send less than 7，040 Roman crowns；and Portugal carried her devotion to science as far as 30，000 cruzados.

Two hundred and fifty-seven francs, this was the modest contribution of Switzerland to the American work. One must freely admit that she did not see the practical side of the matter.It did not seem to her that the mere despatch of a shot to the moon could possibly establish any relation of affairs with her；and it did not seem prudent to her to embark her capital in so hazardous an enterprise.After all, perhaps she was right.

As to Spain, she could not scrape together more than 110 reals. She gave as an excuse that she had her railways to finish.The truth is, that science is not favorably regarded in that country, it is still in a backward state；and moreover, certain Spaniards, not by any means the least educated, did not form a correct estimate of the bulk of the projectile compared with that of the moon.They feared that it would disturb the established order of things.In that case it were better to keep aloof；which they did to the tune of some reals.

There remained but England；and we know the contemptuous antipathy with which she received Barbicane's proposition. The English have but one soul for the whole twenty-five million of inhabitants which Great Britain contains.They hinted that the enterprise of the Gun Club was contrary to the“principle of non-intervention”.And they did not subscribe a single farthing.

At this intimation the Gun Club merely shrugged its shoulders and returned to its great work. When South America, that is to say, Peru, Chili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia, had poured forth their quota into their hands, the sum of$300，000，it found itself in possession of a considerable capital, of which the following is a statement：

United States subscriptions……$4，000，000

Foreign subscriptions……$1，446，675

——

Total……$5，446，675

Such was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the Gun Club.

Let no one be surprised at the vastness of the amount. The work of casting, boring, masonry, the transport of workmen, their establishment in an almost uninhabited country, the construction of furnaces and workshops, the plant, the powder, the projectile, and incipient expenses, would, according to the estimates, absorb nearly the whole.Certain cannon-shots in the Federal war cost one thousand dollars apiece.This one of President Barbicane, unique in the annals of gunnery, might well cost five thousand times more.

On the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory at Coldspring, near New York, which during the war had furnished the largest Parrott, cast-iron guns. It was stipulated between the contracting parties that the manufactory of Coldspring should engage to transport to Tampa Town, in southern Florida, the necessary materials for casting the Columbiad.The work was bound to be completed at latest by the 15th of October following, and the cannon delivered in good condition under penalty of a forfeit of one hundred dollars a day to the moment when the moon should again present herself under the same conditions—that is to say, in eighteen years and eleven days.

The engagement of the workmen, their pay, and all the necessary details of the work, devolved upon the Coldspring Company.

This contract, executed in duplicate, was signed by Barbicane, president of the Gun Club, of the one part, and T. Murchison, director of the Coldspring manufactory, of the other, who thus executed the deed on behalf of their respective principals.





Chapter XIII Stones Hill


When the decision was arrived at by the Gun Club, to the disparagement of Texas, every one in America, where reading is a universal acquirement, set to work to study the geography of Florida. Never before had there been such a sale for works like Bertram's, Roman's, William's, and Cleland on.It became necessary to issue fresh editions of these works.

Barbicane had something better to do than to read. He desired to see things with his own eyes, and to mark the exact position of the proposed gun.So, without a moment's loss of time, he placed at the disposal of the Cambridge Observatory the funds necessary for the construction of a telescope, and entered into negotiations with the house of Breadwill and Co.，of Albany, for the construction of an aluminum projectile of the required size.He then quitted Baltimore, accompanied by J.T.Maston, Major Elphinstone, and the manager of the Coldspring factory.

On the following day, the four fellow-travelers arrived at New Orleans. There they immediately embarked on board the Tampico, a despatch-boat belonging to the Federal navy, which the government had placed at their disposal；and, getting up steam, the coast of Louisiana speedily disappeared from sight.

The passage was not long. Two days after starting, the Tampico, having made four hundred and eighty miles, came in sight of the coast of Florida.On a nearer approach Barbicane found himself in view of a low, flat country of somewhat barren aspect.After coasting along a series of creeks abounding in lobsters and oysters, the Tampico entered the bay of Espiritu Santo, where she finally anchored in a small natural harbor, formed by the embouchure of the River Hillsborough, at seven P.M.，on the 22d of October.

“Gentlemen，”said Barbicane，“we have no time to lose；tomorrow we must obtain horses, and proceed to reconnoiter the country.”

Barbicane had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the inhabitants of Tampa Town came forth to meet him, an honor due to the president who had signalized their country by his choice.

Declining, however, every kind of ovation, Barbicane ensconced himself in a room of the Franklin Hotel.

On the morrow some of the small horses of the Spanish breed, full of vigor and of fire, stood snorting under his windows；but instead of four steeds, here were fifty, together with their riders. Barbicane descended with his three fellow-travelers；and much astonished were they all to find themselves in the midst of such a cavalcade.He remarked that every horseman carried a carbine slung across his shoulders and pistols in his holsters.

On expressing his surprise at these preparations, he was speedily enlightened by a young Floridan, who quietly said：

“Sir, there are Seminoles there.”

“What do you mean by Seminoles?”

“Savages who scour the prairies. We thought it best, therefore, to escort you on your road.”

“Pooh！”cried J. T.Maston, mounting his steed.

“All right，”said the Floridan；“but it is true enough, nevertheless.”

“Gentlemen，”answered Barbicane，“I thank you for your kind attention；but it is time to be off.”

It was five A. M.when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town, made their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek.This little river falls into Hillsborough Bay twelve miles above Tampa Town.Barbicane and his escort coasted along its right bank to the eastward.Soon the waves of the bay disappeared behind a bend of rising ground, and the Floridan“champagne”alone offered itself to view.

Florida, discovered on Palm Sunday, in 1512，by Juan Ponce de Leon, was originally named Pascha Florida. It little deserved that designation, with its dry and parched coasts.But after some few miles of tract the nature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself worthy of the name.Cultivated plains soon appear, where are united all the productions of the northern and tropical floras, terminating in prairies abounding with pineapples and yams, tobacco, rice, cotton-plants, and sugar-canes, which extend beyond reach of sight, flinging their riches broadcast with careless prodigality.

Barbicane appeared highly pleased on observing the progressive elevation of the land；and in answer to a question of J. T.Maston, replied：

“My worthy friend, we cannot do better than sink our Columbiad in these high grounds.”

“To get nearer the moon, perhaps?”said the secretary of the Gun Club.

“Not exactly，”replied Barbicane, smiling；“do you not see that among these elevated plateaus we shall have a much easier work of it?No struggles with the water-springs, which will save us long expensive tubings. Our business, then, is to open our trenches upon ground some hundreds of toises above the level of the sea.”

“You are right, sir，”struck in Murchison, the engineer；“and, if I mistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.”

“I wish we were at the first stroke of the pickaxe，”said the president.

“And I wish we were at the last，”cried J. T.Maston.

About ten A. M.the little band had crossed a dozen miles.To fertile plains succeeded a region of forests.There perfumes of the most varied kinds mingled together in tropical profusion.These almost impenetrable forests were composed of pomegranates, orange-trees, citrons, figs, olives, apricots, bananas, huge vines, whose blossoms and fruits rivaled each other in color and perfume.Beneath the odorous shade of these magnificent trees fluttered and warbled a little world of brilliantly plumaged birds.

J. T.Maston and the major could not repress their admiration on finding themselves in the presence of the glorious beauties of this wealth of nature.President Barbicane, however, less sensitive to these wonders, was in haste to press forward；the very luxuriance of the country was displeasing to him.They hastened onward, therefore, and were compelled to ford several rivers, not without danger, for they were infested with huge alligators from fifteen to eighteen feet long.J.T.Maston courageously menaced them with his steel hook but he only succeeded in frightening some pelicans and teal, while tall flamingos stared stupidly at the party.

At length these denizens of the swamps disappeared in their turn；smaller trees became thinly scattered among less dense thickets—a few isolated groups detached in the midst of endless plains over which ranged herds of startled deer.

“At last，”cried Barbicane, rising in his stirrups，“here we are at the region of pines！”

“Yes！and of savages too，”replied the major.

In fact, some Seminoles had just came in sight upon the horizon；they rode violently backward and forward on their fleet horses, brandishing their spears or discharging their guns with a dull report. These hostile demonstrations, however, had no effect upon Barbicane and his companions.

They were then occupying the center of a rocky plain, which the sun scorched with its parching rays. This was formed by a considerable elevation of the soil, which seemed to offer to the members of the Gun Club all the conditions requisite for the construction of their Columbiad.

“Halt！”said Barbicane, reining up.“Has this place any local appellation?”

“It is called Stones Hill，”replied one of the Floridans.

Barbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, seized his instruments, and began to note his position with extreme exactness. The little band, drawn up in the rear, watched his proceedings in profound silence.

At this moment the sun passed the meridian. Barbicane, after a few moments, rapidly wrote down the result of his observations, and said：

“This spot is situated eighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, in 27°7'N. lat.and 5°7'W.long.of the meridian of Washington.It appears to me by its rocky and barren character to offer all the conditions requisite for our experiment.On that plain will be raised our magazines, workshops, furnaces, and workmen's huts；and here, from this very spot，”said he, stamping his foot on the summit of Stones Hill，“hence shall our projectile take its flight into the regions of the Solar World.”





Chapter XIV Pickaxe and Trowel


The same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town；and Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the Tampico for New Orleans. His object was to enlist an army of workmen, and to collect together the greater part of the materials.The members of the Gun Club remained at Tampa Town, for the purpose of setting on foot the preliminary works by the aid of the people of the country.

Eight days after its departure, the Tampico returned into the bay of Espiritu Santo, with a whole flotilla of steamboats. Murchison had succeeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans.Attracted by the high pay and considerable bounties offered by the Gun Club, he had enlisted a choice legion of stokers, iron-founders, lime-burners, miners, brickmakers, and artisans of every trade, without distinction of color.As many of these people brought their families with them, their departure resembled a perfect emigration.

On the 31st of October, at ten o'clock in the morning, the troop disembarked on the quays of Tampa Town；and one may imagine the activity which pervaded that little town, whose population was thus doubled in a single day.

During the first few days they were busy discharging the cargo brought by the flotilla, the machines, and the rations, as well as a large number of huts constructed of iron plates, separately pieced and numbered. At the same period Barbicane laid the first sleepers of a railway fifteen miles in length, intended to unite Stones Hill with Tampa Town.On the first of November Barbicane quitted Tampa Town with a detachment of workmen；and on the following day the whole town of huts was erected round Stones Hill.This they enclosed with palisades；and in respect of energy and activity, it might have been mistaken for one of the great cities of the Union.Everything was placed under a complete system of discipline, and the works were commenced in most perfect order.

The nature of the soil having been carefully examined, by means of repeated borings, the work of excavation was fixed for the 4th of November.

On that day Barbicane called together his foremen and addressed them as follows：“You are well aware, my friends, of the object with which I have assembled you together in this wild part of Florida. Our business is to construct a cannon measuring nine feet in its interior diameter, six feet thick, and with a stone revetment of nineteen and a half feet in thickness.We have, therefore, a well of sixty feet in diameter to dig down to a depth of nine hundred feet.This great work must be completed within eight months, so that you have 2，543，400 cubic feet of earth to excavate in 255 days；that is to say, in round numbers，10，000 cubic feet per day.That which would present no difficulty to a thousand navvies working in open country will be of course more troublesome in a comparatively confined space.However, the thing must be done, and I reckon for its accomplishment upon your courage as much as upon your skill.”

At eight o'clock the first stroke of the pickaxe was struck upon the soil of Florida；and from that moment that prince of tools was never inactive for one moment in the hands of the excavators. The gangs relieved each other every three hours.

On the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the very center of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill, a circular hole sixty feet in diameter. The pickaxe first struck upon a kind of black earth, six inches in thickness, which was speedily disposed of.To this earth succeeded two feet of fine sand, which was carefully laid aside as being valuable for serving the casting of the inner mould.After the sand appeared some compact white clay, resembling the chalk of Great Britain, which extended down to a depth of four feet.Then the iron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil；a kind of rock formed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid, and which the picks could with difficulty penetrate.At this point the excavation exhibited a depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun.

At the bottom of the excavation they constructed a wheel of oak, a kind of circle strongly bolted together, and of immense strength. The center of this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter equal to the exterior diameter of the Columbiad.Upon this wheel rested the first layers of the masonry, the stones of which were bound together by hydraulic cement, with irresistible tenacity.The workmen, after laying the stones from the circumference to the center, were thus enclosed within a kind of well twenty-one feet in diameter.When this work was accomplished, the miners resumed their picks and cut away the rock from underneath the wheel itself, taking care to support it as they advanced upon blocks of great thickness.At every two feet which the hole gained in depth they successively withdrew the blocks.The wheel then sank little by little, and with it the massive ring of masonry, on the upper bed of which the masons labored incessantly, always reserving some vent holes to permit the escape of gas during the operation of the casting.

This kind of work required on the part of the workmen extreme nicety and minute attention. More than one, in digging underneath the wheel, was dangerously injured by the splinters of stone.But their ardor never relaxed, night or day.By day they worked under the rays of the scorching sun；by night, under the gleam of the electric light.The sounds of the picks against the rock, the bursting of mines, the grinding of the machines, the wreaths of smoke scattered through the air, traced around Stones Hill a circle of terror which the herds of buffaloes and the war parties of the Seminoles never ventured to pass.Nevertheless, the works advanced regularly, as the steam-cranes actively removed the rubbish.Of unexpected obstacles there was little account；and with regard to foreseen difficulties, they were speedily disposed of.

At the expiration of the first month the well had attained the depth assigned for that lapse of time, namely，112 feet. This depth was doubled in December, and trebled in January.

During the month of February the workmen had to contend with a sheet of water which made its way right across the outer soil. It became necessary to employ very powerful pumps and compressed-air engines to drain it off, so as to close up the orifice from whence it issued；just as one stops a leak on board ship.They at last succeeded in getting the upper hand of these untoward streams；only, in consequence of the loosening of the soil, the wheel partly gave way, and a slight partial settlement ensued.This accident cost the life of several workmen.

No fresh occurrence thenceforward arrested the progress of the operation；and on the tenth of June, twenty days before the expiration of the period fixed by Barbicane, the well, lined throughout with its facing of stone, had attained the depth of 900 feet. At the bottom the masonry rested upon a massive block measuring thirty feet in thickness, while on the upper portion it was level with the surrounding soil.

President Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly congratulated their engineer Murchison；the cyclopean work had been accomplished with extraordinary rapidity.

During these eight months Barbicane never quitted Stones Hill for a single instant. Keeping ever close by the work of excavation, he busied himself incessantly with the welfare and health of his workpeople, and was singularly fortunate in warding off the epidemics common to large communities of men, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe which are exposed to the influences of tropical climates.

Many workmen, it is true, paid with their lives for the rashness inherent in these dangerous labors；but these mishaps are impossible to be avoided, and they are classed among the details with which the Americans trouble themselves but little. They have in fact more regard for human nature in general than for the individual in particular.

Nevertheless, Barbicane professed opposite principles to these, and put them in force at every opportunity. So, thanks to his care, his intelligence, his useful intervention in all difficulties, his prodigious and humane sagacity, the average of accidents did not exceed that of transatlantic countries, noted for their excessive precautions—France, for instance, among others, where they reckon about on accident for every two hundred thousand francs of work.





Chapter XV The Fête of the Casting


During the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation the preparatory works of the casting had been carried on simultaneously with extreme rapidity. A stranger arriving at Stones Hill would have been surprised at the spectacle offered to his view.

At 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as a central point, rose 1，200 reverberating ovens, each six feet in diameter, and separated from each other by an interval of demi-toise. The circumference occupied by these 1，200 ovens presented a length of two miles.Being all constructed on the same plan, each with its high quadrangular chimney, they produced a most singular effect.

It will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee had decided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular the white description. This metal, in fact, is the most tenacious, the most ductile, and the most malleable, and consequently suitable for all moulding operations；and when smelted with pit coal, is of superior quality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power, such as cannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like.

Cast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely sufficiently homogeneous；and it requires a second fusion completely to refine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits. So long before being forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, molten in the great furnaces of Coldspring, and brought into contact with coal and silicium heated to a high temperature, was carburized and transformed into cast iron.After this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill.They had, however, to deal with 136，000，000 pounds of iron, a quantity far too costly to send by railway.The cost of transport would have been double that of material.It appeared preferable to freight vessels at New York, and to load them with the iron in bars.This, however, required not less than sixty-eight vessels of 1，000 tons, a veritable fleet, which, quitting New York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the same month ascended the Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their cargoes, without dues, in the port at Tampa Town.Thence the iron was transported by rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January this enormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination.

It will easily be understood that 1，200 furnaces were not too many to melt simultaneously these 60，000 tons of iron. Each of these furnaces contained nearly 140，000 pounds weight of metal.They were all built after the model of those which served for the casting of the Rodman gun；they were trapezoidal in shape, with a high elliptical arch.These furnaces, constructed of fireproof brick, were especially adapted for burning pit coal, with a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were laid.This bottom, inclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the metal to flow into the receiving troughs；and the 1，200 converging trenches carried the molten metal down to the central well.

The day following that on which the works of the masonry and boring had been completed, Barbicane set to work upon the central mould. His object now was to raise within the center of the well, and with a coincident axis, a cylinder 900 feet high, and nine feet in diameter, which should exactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the Columbiad.This cylinder was composed of a mixture of clay and sand, with the addition of a little hay and straw.The space left between the mould and the masonry was intended to be filled up by the molten metal, which would thus form the walls six feet in thickness.This cylinder, in order to maintain its equilibrium, had to be bound by iron bands, and firmly fixed at certain intervals by cross-clamps fastened into the stone lining；after the castings these would be buried in the block of metal, leaving no external projection.

This operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the run of the metal was fixed for the following day.

“This fête of the casting will be a grand ceremony，”said J.T.Maston to his friend Barbicane.

“Undoubtedly，”said Barbicane；“but it will not be a public fête.”

“What！Will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers?”

“I must be very careful, J. T.Maston.The casting of the Columbiad is an extremely delicate, not to say a dangerous operation, and I should prefer its being done privately.At the discharge of the projectile, a fête if you like—till then, no！”

The president was right. The operation involved unforeseen dangers, which a great influx of spectators would have hindered him from averting.It was necessary to preserve complete freedom of movement.No one was admitted within the enclosure except a delegation of members of the Gun Club, who had made the voyage to Tampa Town.Among these was the brisk Bilsby, Tom Hunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan, and the rest of the lot to whom the casting of the Columbiad was a matter of personal interest.J.T.Maston became their cicerone.He omitted no point of detail；he conducted them throughout the magazines, workshops, through the midst of the engines, and compelled them to visit the whole 1，200 furnaces one after the other.At the end of the twelve-hundredth visit they were pretty well knocked up.

The casting was to take place at twelve o'clock precisely. The previous evening each furnace had been charged with 114，000 pounds weight of metal in bars disposed cross-ways to each other, so as to allow the hot air to circulate freely between them.At daybreak the 1，200 chimneys vomited their torrents of flame into the air, and the ground was agitated with dull tremblings.As many pounds of metal as there were to cast, so many pounds of coal were there to burn.Thus there were 68，000 tons of coal which projected in the face of the sun a thick curtain of smoke.The heat soon became insupportable within the circle of furnaces, the rumbling of which resembled the rolling of thunder.The powerful ventilators added their continuous blasts and saturated with oxygen the glowing plates.The operation, to be successful, required to be conducted with great rapidity.On a signal given by a cannon-shot each furnace was to give vent to the molten iron and completely to empty itself.These arrangements made, foremen and workmen waited the preconcerted moment with an impatience mingled with a certain amount of emotion.Not a soul remained within the enclosure.Each superintendent took his post by the aperture of the run.

Barbicane and his colleagues, perched on a neighboring eminence, assisted at the operation. In front of them was a piece of artillery ready to give fire on the signal from the engineer.Some minutes before midday the first driblets of metal began to flow；the reservoirs filled little by little；and, by the time that the whole melting was completely accomplished, it was kept in abeyance for a few minutes in order to facilitate the separation of foreign substances.

Twelve o'clock struck！A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot its flame into the air. Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously opened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept toward the central well, unrolling their incandescent curves.There, down they plunged with a terrific noise into a depth of 900 feet.It was an exciting and a magnificent spectacle.The ground trembled, while these molten waves, launching into the sky their wreaths of smoke, evaporated the moisture of the mould and hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone lining in the form of dense vapor-clouds.These artificial clouds unrolled their thick spirals to a height of 500 toises into the air.A savage, wandering somewhere beyond the limits of the horizon, might have believed that some new crater was forming in the bosom of Florida, although there was neither any eruption, nor typhoon, nor storm, nor struggle of the elements, nor any of those terrible phenomena which nature is capable of producing.No, it was man alone who had produced these reddish vapors, these gigantic flames worthy of a volcano itself, these tremendous vibrations resembling the shock of an earthquake, these reverberations rivaling those of hurricanes and storms；and it was his hand which precipitated into an abyss, dug by himself, a whole Niagara of molten metal！





Chapter XVI The Columbiad


Had the casting succeeded?They were reduced to mere conjecture. There was indeed every reason to expect success, since the mould has absorbed the entire mass of the molten metal；still some considerable time must elapse before they could arrive at any certainty upon the matter.

The patience of the members of the Gun Club was sorely tried during this period of time. But they could do nothing.J.T.Maston escaped roasting by a miracle.Fifteen days after the casting an immense column of smoke was still rising in the open sky and the ground burned the soles of the feet within a radius of two hundred feet round the summit of Stones Hill.It was impossible to approach nearer.All they could do was to wait with what patience they might.

“Here we are at the 10th of August，”exclaimed J. T.Maston one morning，“only four months to the 1st of December！We shall never be ready in time！”Barbicane said nothing, but his silence covered serious irritation.

However, daily observations revealed a certain change going on in the state of the ground. About the 15th of August the vapors ejected had sensibly diminished in intensity and thickness.Some days afterward the earth exhaled only a slight puff of smoke, the last breath of the monster enclosed within its circle of stone.Little by little the belt of heat contracted, until on the 22nd of August, Barbicane, his colleagues, and the engineer were enabled to set foot on the iron sheet which lay level upon the summit of Stones Hill.

“At last！”exclaimed the president of the Gun Club, with an immense sigh of relief.

The work was resumed the same day. They proceeded at once to extract the interior mould, for the purpose of clearing out the boring of the piece.Pickaxes and boring irons were set to work without intermission.The clay and sandy soils had acquired extreme hardness under the action of the heat；but, by the aid of the machines, the rubbish on being dug out was rapidly carted away on railway wagons；and such was the ardor of the work, so persuasive the arguments of Barbicane's dollars, that by the 3rd of September all traces of the mould had entirely disappeared.

Immediately the operation of boring was commenced；and by the aid of powerful machines, a few weeks later, the inner surface of the immense tube had been rendered perfectly cylindrical, and the bore of the piece had acquired a thorough polish.

At length, on the 22d of September, less than a twelvemonth after Barbicane's original proposition, the enormous weapon, accurately bored, and exactly vertically pointed, was ready for work. There was only the moon now to wait for；and they were pretty sure that she would not fail in the rendezvous.

The ecstasy of J. T.Maston knew no bounds, and he narrowly escaped a frightful fall while staring down the tube.But for the strong hand of Colonel Blomsberry, the worthy secretary, like a modern Erostratus, would have found his death in the depths of the Columbiad.

The cannon was then finished；there was no possible doubt as to its perfect completion. So, on the 6th of October, Captain Nicholl opened an account between himself and President Barbicane, in which he debited himself to the latter in the sum of two thousand dollars.One may believe that the captain's wrath was increased to its highest point, and must have made him seriously ill.However, he had still three bets of three, four, and five thousand dollars, respectively；and if he gained two out of these, his position would not be very bad.But the money question did not enter into his calculations；it was the success of his rival in casting a cannon against which iron plates sixty feet thick would have been ineffectual, that dealt him a terrible blow.

After the 23rd of September the enclosure of Stones Hill was thrown open to the public；and it will be easily imagined what was the concourse of visitors to this spot！There was an incessant flow of people to and from Tampa Town and the place, which resembled a procession, or rather, in fact, a pilgrimage.

It was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the experiment itself, the aggregate of spectators would be counted by millions；for they were already arriving from all parts of the earth upon this narrow strip of promontory. Europe was emigrating to America.

Up to that time, however, it must be confessed, the curiosity of the numerous comers was but scantily gratified. Most had counted upon witnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they were treated to nothing but smoke.This was sorry food for hungry eyes；but Barbicane would admit no one to that operation.Then ensued grumbling, discontent, murmurs；they blamed the president, taxed him with dictatorial conduct.His proceedings were declared“un-American”.There was very nearly a riot round Stones Hill；but Barbicane remained inflexible.When, however, the Columbiad was entirely finished, this state of closed doors could no longer be maintained；besides it would have been bad taste, and even imprudence, to affront the public feeling.Barbicane, therefore, opened the enclosure to all comers；but, true to his practical disposition, he determined to coin money out of the public curiosity.

It was something, indeed, to be enabled to contemplate this immense Columbiad；but to descend into its depths, this seemed to the Americans the ne plus ultra of earthly felicity. Consequently, there was not one curious spectator who was not willing to give himself the treat of visiting the interior of this great metallic abyss.Baskets suspended from steam-cranes permitted them to satisfy their curiosity.There was a perfect mania.Women, children, old men, all made it a point of duty to penetrate the mysteries of the colossal gun.The fare for the descent was fixed at five dollars per head；and despite this high charge, during the two months which preceded the experiment, the influx of visitors enabled the Gun Club to pocket nearly five hundred thousand dollars！

It is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad were the members of the Gun Club. This privilege was justly reserved for that illustrious body.The ceremony took place on the 25th of September.A basket of honor took down the president, J.T.Maston, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members of the club, to the number of ten in all.How hot it was at the bottom of that long tube of metal！They were half suffocated.But what delight！What ecstasy！A table had been laid with ten covers on the massive stone which formed the bottom of the Columbiad, and lighted by a jet of electric light resembling that of day itself.Numerous exquisite dishes, which seemed to descend from heaven, were placed successively before the guests, and the richest wines of France flowed in profusion during this splendid repast, served nine hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth！

The festival was animated, not to say somewhat noisy. Toasts flew backward and forward.They drank to the earth and to her satellite, to the Gun Club, the Union, the Moon, Diana, Phoebe, Selene, the“peaceful courier of the night！”All the hurrahs, carried upward upon the sonorous waves of the immense acoustic tube, arrived with the sound of thunder at its mouth；and the multitude ranged round Stones Hill heartily united their shouts with those of the ten revelers hidden from view at the bottom of the gigantic Columbiad.

J. T.Maston was no longer master of himself.Whether he shouted or gesticulated, ate or drank most, would be a difficult matter to determine.At all events, he would not have given his place up for an empire，“not even if the cannon—loaded, primed, and fired at that very moment—were to blow him in pieces into the planetary world.”





Chapter XVII A Telegraphic Dispatch


The great works undertaken by the Gun Club had now virtually come to an end；and two months still remained before the day for the discharge of the shot to the moon. To the general impatience these two months appeared as long as years！Hitherto the smallest details of the operation had been daily chronicled by the journals, which the public devoured with eager eyes.

Just at this moment a circumstance, the most unexpected, the most extraordinary and incredible, occurred to rouse afresh their panting spirits, and to throw every mind into a state of the most violent excitement.

One day, the 30th of September, at 3：47 P. M.，a telegram, transmitted by cable from Valentia（Ireland）to Newfoundland and the American Mainland, arrived at the address of President Barbicane.

The president tore open the envelope, read the dispatch, and, despite his remarkable powers of self-control, his lips turned pale and his eyes grew dim, on reading the twenty words of this telegram.

Here is the text of the dispatch, which figures now in the archives of the Gun Club：

FRANCE, PARIS，

30 September，4 A. M.

Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States.

Substitute for your spherical shell a cylinder-conical projectile. I shall go inside.Shall arrive by steamer Atlanta.MICHEL ARDAN.





Chapter XVIII The Passenger of the Atlanta


If this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric wires, had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope, Barbicane would not have hesitated a moment. He would have held his tongue about it, both as a measure of prudence, and in order not to have to reconsider his plans.This telegram might be a cover for some jest, especially as it came from a Frenchman.What human being would ever have conceived the idea of such a journey?And, if such a person really existed, he must be an idiot, whom one would shut up in a lunatic ward, rather than within the walls of the projectile.

The contents of the dispatch, however, speedily became known；for the telegraphic officials possessed but little discretion, and Michel Ardan's proposition ran at once throughout the several States of the Union. Barbicane, had, therefore, no further motives for keeping silence.Consequently, he called together such of his colleagues as were at the moment in Tampa Town, and without any expression of his own opinions simply read to them the laconic text itself.It was received with every possible variety of expressions of doubt, incredulity, and derision from every one, with the exception of J.T.Maston, who exclaimed，“It is a grand idea, however！”

When Barbicane originally proposed to send a shot to the moon every one looked upon the enterprise as simple and practicable enough—a mere question of gunnery；but when a person, professing to be a reasonable being, offered to take passage within the projectile, the whole thing became a farce, or, in plainer language a humbug.

One question, however, remained. Did such a being exist?This telegram flashed across the depths of the Atlantic, the designation of the vessel on board which he was to take his passage, the date assigned for his speedy arrival, all combined to impart a certain character of reality to the proposal.They must get some clearer notion of the matter.Scattered groups of inquirers at length condensed themselves into a compact crowd, which made straight for the residence of President Barbicane.That worthy individual was keeping quiet with the intention of watching events as they arose.But he had forgotten to take into account the public impatience；and it was with no pleasant countenance that he watched the population of Tampa Town gathering under his windows.The murmurs and vociferations below presently obliged him to appear.He came forward, therefore, and on silence being procured, a citizen put point-blank to him the following question：“Is the person mentioned in the telegram, under the name of Michel Ardan, on his way here?Yes or no?”

“Gentlemen，”replied Barbicane，“I know no more than you do.”

“We must know，”roared the impatient voices.

“Time will show，”calmly replied the president.

“Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense，”replied the orator.“Have you altered the plans of the projectile according to the request of the telegram?”

“Not yet, gentlemen；but you are right！We must have better information to go by. The telegraph must complete its information.”

“To the telegraph！”roared the crowd.

Barbicane descended；and heading the immense assemblage, led the way to the telegraph office. A few minutes later a telegram was dispatched to the secretary of the underwriters at Liverpool, requesting answers to the following queries：

“About the ship Atlanta—when did she leave Europe?Had she on board a Frenchman named Michel Ardan?”

Two hours afterward Barbicane received information too exact to leave room for the smallest remaining doubt.

“The steamer Atlanta from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd of October, bound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne on the list of passengers by the name of Michel Ardan.”

That very evening he wrote to the house of Breadwill and Co.，requesting them to suspend the casting of the projectile until the receipt of further orders. On the 10th of October, at nine A.M.，the semaphores of the Bahama Canal signaled a thick smoke on the horizon.Two hours later a large steamer exchanged signals with them.the name of the Atlanta flew at once over Tampa Town.At four o'clock the English vessel entered the Bay of Espiritu Santo.At five it crossed the passage of Hillsborough Bay at full steam.At six she cast anchor at Port Tampa.The anchor had scarcely caught the sandy bottom when five hundred boats surrounded the Atlanta, and the steamer was taken by assault.Barbicane was the first to set foot on deck, and in a voice of which he vainly tried to conceal the emotion, called“Michel Ardan！”

“Here！”replied an individual perched on the poop.

Barbicane, with arms crossed, looked fixedly at the passenger of the Atlanta.

He was a man of about forty-two years of age, of large build, but slightly round-shouldered. His massive head momentarily shook a shock of reddish hair, which resembled a lion's mane.His face was short with a broad forehead, and furnished with a moustache as bristly as a cat's, and little patches of yellowish whiskers upon full cheeks.Round, wildish eyes, slightly near-sighted, completed a physiognomy essentially feline.His nose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly sweet in expression, high forehead, intelligent and furrowed with wrinkles like a newly-plowed field.The body was powerfully developed and firmly fixed upon long legs.Muscular arms, and a general air of decision gave him the appearance of a hardy, jolly companion.

On the bridge of the steamer, in the midst of the crowd, he bustled to and fro, never still for a moment，“dragging his anchors”，as the sailors say, gesticulating, making free with everybody, biting his nails with nervous avidity. He was one of those originals which nature sometimes invents in the freak of a moment, and of which she then breaks the mould.

Among other peculiarities, this curiosity gave himself out for a sublime ignoramus，“like Shakespeare”，and professed supreme contempt for all scientific men. Those“fellows”，as he called them，“are only fit to mark the points, while we play the game.”He was, in fact, a thorough Bohemian, adventurous, but not an adventurer；a hare-brained fellow, a kind of Icarus, only possessing relays of wings.For the rest, he was ever in scrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet, like those little figures which they sell for children's toys.In a few words, his motto was“I have my opinions”，and the love of the impossible constituted his ruling passion.

Such was the passenger of the Atlanta, always excitable, as if boiling under the action of some internal fire by the character of his physical organization. If ever two individuals offered a striking contrast to each other, these were certainly Michel Ardan and the Yankee Barbicane；both, moreover, being equally enterprising and daring, each in his own way.

The scrutiny which the president of the Gun Club had instituted regarding this new rival was quickly interrupted by the shouts and hurrahs of the crowd. The cries became at last so uproarious, and the popular enthusiasm assumed so personal a form, that Michel Ardan, after having shaken hands some thousands of times, at the imminent risk of leaving his fingers behind him, was fain at last to make a bolt for his cabin.

Barbicane followed him without uttering a word.

“You are Barbicane, I suppose?”said Michel Ardan, in a tone of voice in which he would have addressed a friend of twenty years'standing.

“Yes，”replied the president of the Gun Club.

“All right！how d'ye do, Barbicane?how are you getting on—pretty well?That's right.”

“So，”said Barbicane without further preliminary，“you are quite determined to go.”

“Quite decided.”

“Nothing will stop you?”

“Nothing. Have you modified your projectile according to my telegram.”

“I waited for your arrival. But，”asked Barbicane again，“have you carefully reflected?”

“Reflected?have I any time to spare?I find an opportunity of making a tour in the moon, and I mean to profit by it. There is the whole gist of the matter.”

Barbicane looked hard at this man who spoke so lightly of his project with such complete absence of anxiety.“But, at least，”said he，“you have some plans, some means of carrying your project into execution?”

“Excellent, my dear Barbicane；only permit me to offer one remark：My wish is to tell my story once for all, to everybody, and then have done with it；then there will be no need for recapitulation. So, if you have no objection, assemble your friends, colleagues, the whole town, all Florida, all America if you like, and tomorrow I shall be ready to explain my plans and answer any objections whatever that may be advanced.You may rest assured I shall wait without stirring.Will that suit you?”

“All right，”replied Barbicane.

So saying, the president left the cabin and informed the crowd of the proposal of Michel Ardan. His words were received with clappings of hands and shouts of joy.They had removed all difficulties.Tomorrow every one would contemplate at his ease this European hero.However, some of the spectators, more infatuated than the rest, would not leave the deck of the Atlanta.They passed the night on board.Among others J.T.Maston got his hook fixed in the combing of the poop, and it pretty nearly required the capstan to get it out again.

“He is a hero！A hero！”he cried, a theme of which he was never tired of ringing the changes.“And we are only like weak, silly women, compared with this European！”

As to the president, after having suggested to the visitors it was time to retire, he re-entered the passenger's cabin, and remained there till the bell of the steamer made it midnight.

But then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and parted on terms of intimate friendship.





Chapter XIX A Monster Meeting


On the following day Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet questions might be put to Michel Ardan, was desirous of reducing the number of the audience to a few of the initiated, his own colleagues for instance. He might as well have tried to check the Falls of Niagara！He was compelled, therefore, to give up the idea, and let his new friend run the chances of a public conference.The place chosen for this monster meeting was a vast plain situated in the rear of the town.In a few hours, thanks to the help of the shipping in port, an immense roofing of canvas was stretched over the parched prairie, and protected it from the burning rays of the sun.There three hundred thousand people braved for many hours the stifling heat while awaiting the arrival of the Frenchman.Of this crowd of spectators a first set could both see and hear；a second set saw badly and heard nothing at all；and as for the third, it could neither see nor hear anything at all.At three o'clock Michel Ardan made his appearance, accompanied by the principal members of the Gun Club.He was supported on his right by President Barbicane, and on his left by J.T.Maston, more radiant than the midday sun, and nearly as ruddy.Ardan mounted a platform, from the top of which his view extended over a sea of black hats.

He exhibited not the slightest embarrassment；he was just as gay, familiar, and pleasant as if he were at home. To the hurrahs which greeted him he replied by a graceful bow；then, waving his hands to request silence, he spoke in perfectly correct English as follows：

“Gentlemen, despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a short time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which seem to have so interested you. I am neither an orator nor a man of science, and I had no idea of addressing you in public；but my friend Barbicane has told me that you would like to hear me, and I am quite at your service.Listen to me, therefore, with your six hundred thousand ears, and please excuse the faults of the speaker.Now pray do not forget that you see before you a perfect ignoramus whose ignorance goes so far that he cannot even understand the difficulties！It seemed to him that it was a matter quite simple, natural, and easy to take one's place in a projectile and start for the moon！That journey must be undertaken sooner or later；and, as for the mode of locomotion adopted, it follows simply the law of progress.Man began by walking on all-fours；then, one fine day, on two feet；then in a carriage；then in a stage-coach；and lastly by railway.Well, the projectile is the vehicle of the future, and the planets themselves are nothing else！Now some of you, gentlemen, may imagine that the velocity we propose to impart to it is extravagant.It is nothing of the kind.All the stars exceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself is at this moment carrying us round the sun at three times as rapid a rate, and yet she is a mere lounger on the way compared with many others of the planets！And her velocity is constantly decreasing.Is it not evident, then, I ask you, that there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?

“Yes, gentlemen，”continued the orator，“in spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York！Distance is but a relative expression, and must end by being reduced to zero.”

The assembly, strongly predisposed as they were in favor of the French hero, were slightly staggered at this bold theory. Michel Ardan perceived the fact.

“Gentlemen，”he continued with a pleasant smile，“you do not seem quite convinced. Very good！Let us reason the matter out.Do you know how long it would take for an express train to reach the moon?Three hundred days；no more！And what is that?The distance is no more than nine times the circumference of the earth；and there are no sailors or travelers, of even moderate activity, who have not made longer journeys than that in their lifetime.And now consider that I shall be only ninety-seven hours on my journey.Ah！I see you are reckoning that the moon is a long way off from the earth, and that one must think twice before making the experiment.What would you say, then, if we were talking of going to Neptune, which revolves at a distance of more than one thousand one hundred and forty-seven millions of miles from the sun！And yet what is that compared with the distance of the fixed stars, some of which, such as Arcturus, are billions of miles distant from us?And then you talk of the distance which separates the planets from the sun！And there are people who affirm that such a thing as distance exists.Absurdity, folly, idiotic nonsense！Would you know what I think of our own solar universe?Shall I tell you my theory?It is very simple！In my opinion the solar system is a solid homogeneous body；the planets which compose it are in actual contact with each other；and whatever space exists between them is nothing more than the space which separates the molecules of the densest metal, such as silver, iron, or platinum！I have the right, therefore, to affirm, and I repeat, with the conviction which must penetrate all your minds，‘Distance is but an empty name；distance does not really exist！'”

“Hurrah！”cried one voice（need it be said it was that of J. T.Maston）.“Distance does not exist！”And overcome by the energy of his movements, he nearly fell from the platform to the ground.He just escaped a severe fall, which would have proved to him that distance was by no means an empty name.

“Gentlemen，”resumed the orator，“I repeat that the distance between the earth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and undeserving of serious consideration. I am convinced that before twenty years are over one-half of our earth will have paid a visit to the moon.Now, my worthy friends, if you have any question to put to me, you will, I fear, sadly embarrass a poor man like myself；still I will do my best to answer you.”

Up to this point, the president of the Gun Club had been satisfied with the turn which the discussion had assumed. It became now, however, desirable to divert Ardan from questions of a practical nature, with which he was doubtless far less conversant.Barbicane, therefore, hastened to get in a word, and began by asking his new friend whether he thought that the moon and the planets were inhabited.

“You put before me a great problem, my worthy president，”replied the orator, smiling.“Still, men of great intelligence, such as Plutarch, Swedenborg, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and others have, if I mistake not, pronounced in the affirmative.Looking at the question from the natural philosopher's point of view, I should say that nothing useless existed in the world；and, replying to your question by another, I should venture to assert, that if these worlds are habitable, they either are, have been, or will be inhabited.”

“No one could answer more logically or fairly，”replied the president.“The question then reverts to this：Are these worlds habitable?For my own part I believe they are.”

“For myself, I feel certain of it，”said Michel Ardan.

“Nevertheless，”retorted one of the audience，“there are many arguments against the habitability of the worlds. The conditions of life must evidently be greatly modified upon the majority of them.To mention only the planets, we should be either broiled alive in some, or frozen to death in others, according as they are more or less removed from the sun.”

“I regret，”replied Michel Ardan，“that I have not the honor of personally knowing my contradictor, for I would have attempted to answer him. His objection has its merits, I admit；but I think we may successfully combat it, as well as all others which affect the habitability of other worlds.If I were a natural philosopher, I would tell him that if less of caloric were set in motion upon the planets which are nearest to the sun, and more, on the contrary, upon those which are farthest removed from it, this simple fact would alone suffice to equalize the heat, and to render the temperature of those worlds supportable by beings organized like ourselves.If I were a naturalist, I would tell him that, according to some illustrious men of science, nature has furnished us with instances upon the earth of animals existing under very varying conditions of life；that fish respire in a medium fatal to other animals；that amphibious creatures possess a double existence very difficult of explanation；that certain denizens of the seas maintain life at enormous depths, and there support a pressure equal to that of fifty or sixty atmospheres without being crushed；that several aquatic insects, insensible to temperature, are met with equally among boiling springs and in the frozen plains of the Polar Sea；in fine, that we cannot help recognizing in nature a diversity of means of operation oftentimes incomprehensible, but not the less real.If I were a chemist, I would tell him that the aerolites, bodies evidently formed exteriorly of our terrestrial globe, have, upon analysis, revealed indisputable traces of carbon, a substance which owes its origin solely to organized beings, and which, according to the experiments of Reichenbach, must necessarily itself have been endued with animation.And lastly, were I a theologian, I would tell him that the scheme of the Divine Redemption, according to St.Paul, seems to be applicable, not merely to the earth, but to all the celestial worlds.But, unfortunately, I am neither theologian, nor chemist, nor naturalist, nor philosopher；therefore, in my absolute ignorance of the great laws which govern the universe, I confine myself to saying in reply，‘I do not know whether the worlds are inhabited or not；and since I do not know, I am going to see！'”

Whether Michel Ardan's antagonist hazarded any further arguments or not it is impossible to say, for the uproarious shouts of the crowd would not allow any expression of opinion to gain a hearing. On silence being restored, the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the following remarks：

“Gentlemen, you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon this great question. There is another altogether different line of argument in favor of the habitability of the stars, which I omit for the present.I only desire to call attention to one point.To those who maintain that the planets are not inhabited one may reply：you might be perfectly in the right, if you could only show that the earth is the best possible world, in spite of what Voltaire has said.She has but one satellite, while Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune have each several, an advantage by no means to be despised.But that which renders our own globe so uncomfortable is the inclination of its axis to the plane of its orbit.Hence the inequality of days and nights；hence the disagreeable diversity of the seasons.On the surface of our unhappy spheroid we are always either too hot or too cold；we are frozen in winter, broiled in summer；it is the planet of rheumatism, coughs, bronchitis；while on the surface of Jupiter, for example, where the axis is but slightly inclined, the inhabitants may enjoy uniform temperatures.It possesses zones of perpetual springs, summers, autumns, and winters；every Jovian may choose for himself what climate he likes, and there spend the whole of his life in security from all variations of temperature.You will, I am sure, readily admit this superiority of Jupiter over our own planet, to say nothing of his years, which each equal twelve of ours！Under such auspices and such marvelous conditions of existence, it appears to me that the inhabitants of so fortunate a world must be in every respect superior to ourselves.All we require, in order to attain such perfection, is the mere trifle of having an axis of rotation less inclined to the plane of its orbit！”

“Hurrah！”roared an energetic voice.“Let us unite our efforts, invent the necessary machines, and rectify the earth's axis！”

A thunder of applause followed this proposal, the author of which was, of course, no other than J. T.Maston.And, in all probability, if the truth must be told, if the Yankees could only have found a point of application for it, they would have constructed a lever capable of raising the earth and rectifying its axis.It was just this deficiency which baffled these daring mechanicians.





Chapter XX Attack and Riposte


As soon as the excitement had subsided, the following words were heard uttered in a strong and determined voice：

“Now that the speaker has favored us with so much imagination, would he be so good as to return to his subject, and give us a little practical view of the question?”

All eyes were directed toward the person who spoke. He was a little dried-up man, of an active figure, with an American“goatee”beard.Profiting by the different movements in the crowd, he had managed by degrees to gain the front row of spectators.There, with arms crossed and stern gaze, he watched the hero of the meeting.After having put his question he remained silent, and appeared to take no notice of the thousands of looks directed toward himself, nor of the murmur of disapprobation excited by his words.Meeting at first with no reply, he repeated his question with marked emphasis, adding，“We are here to talk about the moon and not about the earth.”

“You are right, sir，”replied Michel Ardan；“the discussion has become irregular. We will return to the moon.”

“Sir，”said the unknown，“you pretend that our satellite is inhabited. Very good, but if Selenites do exist, that race of beings assuredly must live without breathing, for—I warn you for your own sake—there is not the smallest particle of air on the surface of the moon.”

At this remark Ardan pushed up his shock of red hair；he saw that he was on the point of being involved in a struggle with this person upon the very gist of the whole question. He looked sternly at him in his turn and said：

“Oh！So there is no air in the moon?And pray, if you are so good, who ventures to affirm that?

“The men of science.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

“Sir，”replied Michel，“pleasantry apart, I have a profound respect for men of science who do possess science, but a profound contempt for men of science who do not.”

“Do you know any who belong to the latter category?”

“Decidedly. In France there are some who maintain that, mathematically, a bird cannot possibly fly；and others who demonstrate theoretically that fishes were never made to live in water.”

“I have nothing to do with persons of that description, and I can quote, in support of my statement, names which you cannot refuse deference to.”

“Then, sir, you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant, who, besides, asks nothing better than to learn.”

“Why, then, do you introduce scientific questions if you have never studied them?”asked the unknown somewhat coarsely.

“For the reason that‘he is always brave who never suspects danger'. I know nothing, it is true；but it is precisely my very weakness which constitutes my strength.”

“Your weakness amounts to folly，”retorted the unknown in a passion.

“All the better，”replied our Frenchman，“if it carries me up to the moon.”

Barbicane and his colleagues devoured with their eyes the intruder who had so boldly placed himself in antagonism to their enterprise. Nobody knew him, and the president, uneasy as to the result of so free a discussion, watched his new friend with some anxiety.The meeting began to be somewhat fidgety also, for the contest directed their attention to the dangers, if not the actual impossibilities, of the proposed expedition.

“Sir，”replied Ardan's antagonist，“there are many and incontrovertible reasons which prove the absence of an atmosphere in the moon. I might say that, a priori, if one ever did exist, it must have been absorbed by the earth；but I prefer to bring forward indisputable facts.”

“Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.”

“You know，”said the stranger，“that when any luminous rays cross a medium such as the air, they are deflected out of the straight line；in other words, they undergo refraction. Well！When stars are occulted by the moon, their rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, exhibit not the least deviation, nor offer the slightest indication of refraction.It follows, therefore, that the moon cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere.

“In point of fact，”replied Ardan，“this is your chief, if not your only argument；and a really scientific man might be puzzled to answer it. For myself, I will simply say that it is defective, because it assumes that the angular diameter of the moon has been completely determined, which is not the case.But let us proceed.Tell me, my dear sir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon's surface?”

“Extinct, yes！In activity, no！”

“These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?”

“True, but, as they furnish themselves the oxygen necessary for combustion, the mere fact of their eruption does not prove the presence of an atmosphere.”

“Proceed again, then；and let us set aside this class of arguments in order to come to direct observations. In 1715，the astronomers Louville and Halley, watching the eclipse of the 3rd of May, remarked some very extraordinary scintillations.These jets of light, rapid in nature, and of frequent recurrence, they attributed to thunderstorms generated in the lunar atmosphere.”

“In 1715，”replied the unknown，“the astronomers Louville and Halley mistook for lunar phenomena some which were purely terrestrial, such as meteoric or other bodies which are generated in our own atmosphere. This was the scientific explanation at the time of the facts；and that is my answer now.”

“On again, then，”replied Ardan；“Herschel, in 1787，observed a great number of luminous points on the moon's surface, did he not?”

“Yes！but without offering any solution of them. Herschel himself never inferred from them the necessity of a lunar atmosphere.And I may add that Baeer and Maedler, the two great authorities upon the moon, are quite agreed as to the entire absence of air on its surface.”

A movement was here manifest among the assemblage, who appeared to be growing excited by the arguments of this singular personage.

“Let us proceed，”replied Ardan, with perfect coolness，“and come to one important fact. A skillful French astronomer, M.Laussedat, in watching the eclipse of July 18，1860，probed that the horns of the lunar crescent were rounded and truncated.Now, this appearance could only have been produced by a deviation of the solar rays in traversing the atmosphere of the moon.There is no other possible explanation of the facts.”

“But is this established as a fact?”

“Absolutely certain！”

A counter-movement here took place in favor of the hero of the meeting, whose opponent was now reduced to silence. Ardan resumed the conversation；and without exhibiting any exultation at the advantage he had gained, simply said：

“You see, then, my dear sir, we must not pronounce with absolute positiveness against the existence of an atmosphere in the moon. That atmosphere is, probably, of extreme rarity；nevertheless at the present day science generally admits that it exists.”

“Not in the mountains, at all events，”returned the unknown, unwilling to give in.

“No！But at the bottom of the valleys, and not exceeding a few hundred feet in height.”

“In any case you will do well to take every precaution, for the air will be terribly rarified.”

“My good sir, there will always be enough for a solitary individual；besides, once arrived up there, I shall do my best to economize, and not to breathe except on grand occasions！”

A tremendous roar of laughter rang in the ears of the mysterious interlocutor, who glared fiercely round upon the assembly.

“Then，”continued Ardan, with a careless air，“since we are in accord regarding the presence of a certain atmosphere, we are forced to admit the presence of a certain quantity of water. This is a happy consequence for me.Moreover, my amiable contradictor, permit me to submit to you one further observation.We only know one side of the moon's disc；and if there is but little air on the face presented to us, it is possible that there is plenty on the one turned away from us.”

“And for what reason?”

“Because the moon, under the action of the earth's attraction, has assumed the form of an egg, which we look at from the smaller end. Hence it follows, by Hausen's calculations, that its center of gravity is situated in the other hemisphere.Hence it results that the great mass of air and water must have been drawn away to the other face of our satellite during the first days of its creation.”

“Pure fancies！”cried the unknown.

“No！Pure theories！which are based upon the laws of mechanics, and it seems difficult to me to refute them. I appeal then to this meeting, and I put it to them whether life, such as exists upon the earth, is possible on the surface of the moon?”

Three hundred thousand auditors at once applauded the proposition. Ardan's opponent tried to get in another word, but he could not obtain a hearing.Cries and menaces fell upon him like hail.

“Enough！enough！”cried some.

“Drive the intruder off！”shouted others.

“Turn him out！”roared the exasperated crowd.

But he, holding firmly on to the platform, did not budge an inch, and let the storm pass on, which would soon have assumed formidable proportions, if Michel Ardan had not quieted it by a gesture. He was too chivalrous to abandon his opponent in an apparent extremity.

“You wished to say a few more words?”he asked, in a pleasant voice.

“Yes, a thousand；or rather, no, only one！If you persevere in your enterprise, you must be a—”

“Very rash person！How can you treat me as such?me, who have demanded a cylindro-conical projectile, in order to prevent turning round and round on my way like a squirrel?”

“But, unhappy man, the dreadful recoil will smash you to pieces at your starting.”

“My dear contradictor, you have just put your finger upon the true and only difficulty；nevertheless, I have too good an opinion of the industrial genius of the Americans not to believe that they will succeed in overcoming it.”

“But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing the strata of air?”

“Oh！The walls are thick, and I shall soon have crossed the atmosphere.”

“But victuals and water?”

“I have calculated for a twelvemonth's supply and I shall be only four days on the journey.”

“But for air to breathe on the road?”

“I shall make it by a chemical process.”

“But your fall on the moon, supposing you ever reach it?”

“It will be six times less dangerous than a sudden fall upon the earth, because the weight will be only one-sixth as great on the surface of the moon.”

“Still it will be enough to smash you like glass！”

“What is to prevent my retarding the shock by means of rockets conveniently placed, and lighted at the right moment?”

“But after all, supposing all difficulties surmounted, all obstacles removed, supposing everything combined to favor you, and granting that you may arrive safe and sound in the moon, how will you come back?”

“I am not coming back！”

At this reply, almost sublime in its very simplicity, the assembly became silent. But its silence was more eloquent than could have been its cries of enthusiasm.The unknown profited by the opportunity and once more protested：

“You will inevitably kill yourself！”he cried；“and your death will be that of a madman, useless even to science！”

“Go on, my dear unknown, for truly your prophecies are most agreeable！”

“It really is too much！”cried Michel Ardan's adversary.“I do not know why I should continue so frivolous a discussion！Please yourself about this insane expedition！We need not trouble ourselves about you！”

“Pray don't stand upon ceremony！”

“No！another person is responsible for your act.”

“Who, may I ask?”demanded Michel Ardan in an imperious tone.

“The ignoramus who organized this equally absurd and impossible experiment！”

The attack was direct. Barbicane, ever since the interference of the unknown, had been making fearful efforts of self-control；now, however, seeing himself directly attacked, he could restrain himself no longer.He rose suddenly, and was rushing upon the enemy who thus braved him to the face, when all at once he found himself separated from him.

The platform was lifted by a hundred strong arms, and the president of the Gun Club shared with Michel Ardan triumphal honors. The shield was heavy, but the bearers came in continuous relays, disputing, struggling, even fighting among themselves in their eagerness to lend their shoulders to this demonstration.

However, the unknown had not profited by the tumult to quit his post. Besides he could not have done it in the midst of that compact crowd.There he held on in the front row with crossed arms, glaring at President Barbicane.

The shouts of the immense crowd continued at their highest pitch throughout this triumphant march. Michel Ardan took it all with evident pleasure.His face gleamed with delight.Several times the platform seemed seized with pitching and rolling like a weather beaten ship.But the two heros of the meeting had good sea-legs.They never stumbled；and their vessel arrived without dues at the port of Tampa Town.

Michel Ardan managed fortunately to escape from the last embraces of his vigorous admirers. He made for the Hotel Franklin, quickly gained his chamber, and slid under the bedclothes, while an army of a hundred thousand men kept watch under his windows.

During this time a scene, short, grave, and decisive, took place between the mysterious personage and the president of the Gun Club.

Barbicane, free at last, had gone straight at his adversary.

“Come！”he said shortly.

The other followed him on the quay；and the two presently found themselves alone at the entrance of an open wharf on Jones'Fall.

The two enemies, still mutually unknown, gazed at each other.

“Who are you?”asked Barbicane.

“Captain Nicholl！”

“So I suspected. Hitherto chance has never thrown you in my way.”

“I am come for that purpose.”

“You have insulted me.”

“Publicly！”

“And you will answer to me for this insult?”

“At this very moment.”

“No！I desire that all that passes between us shall be secret. There is a wood situated three miles from Tampa, the wood of Skersnaw.Do you know it?”

“I know it.”

“Will you be so good as to enter it tomorrow morning at five o'clock, on one side?”

“Yes！if you will enter at the other side at the same hour.”

“And you will not forget your rifle?”said Barbicane.

“No more than you will forget yours?”replied Nicholl.

These words having been coldly spoken, the president of the Gun Club and the captain parted. Barbicane returned to his lodging；but instead of snatching a few hours of repose, he passed the night in endeavoring to discover a means of evading the recoil of the projectile, and resolving the difficult problem proposed by Michel Ardan during the discussion at the meeting.





Chapter XXI How a Frenchman Manages an Affair


While the contract of this duel was being discussed by the president and the captain—this dreadful, savage duel, in which each adversary became a man-hunter—Michel Ardan was resting from the fatigues of his triumph. Resting is hardly an appropriate expression, for American beds rival marble or granite tables for hardness.

Ardan was sleeping, then, badly enough, tossing about between the cloths which served him for sheets, and he was dreaming of making a more comfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise disturbed his dreams. Thundering blows shook his door.They seemed to be caused by some iron instrument.A great deal of loud talking was distinguishable in this racket, which was rather too early in the morning.“Open the door，”some one shrieked，“for heaven's sake！”Ardan saw no reason for complying with a demand so roughly expressed.However, he got up and opened the door just as it was giving way before the blows of this determined visitor.The secretary of the Gun Club burst into the room.A bomb could not have made more noise or have entered the room with less ceremony.

“Last night，”cried J. T.Maston, ex abrupto，“our president was publicly insulted during the meeting.He provoked his adversary, who is none other than Captain Nicholl！They are fighting this morning in the wood of Skersnaw.I heard all the particulars from the mouth of Barbicane himself.If he is killed, then our scheme is at an end.We must prevent his duel；and one man alone has enough influence over Barbicane to stop him, and that man is Michel Ardan.”

While J. T.Maston was speaking, Michel Ardan, without interrupting him, had hastily put on his clothes；and, in less than two minutes, the two friends were making for the suburbs of Tampa Town with rapid strides.

It was during this walk that J. T.Maston told Ardan the state of the case.He told him the real causes of the hostility between Barbicane and Nicholl；how it was of old date, and why, thanks to unknown friends, the president and the captain had, as yet, never met face to face.He added that it arose simply from a rivalry between iron plates and shot, and, finally, that the scene at the meeting was only the long-wished-for opportunity for Nicholl to pay off an old grudge.

Nothing is more dreadful than private duels in America. The two adversaries attack each other like wild beasts.Then it is that they might well covet those wonderful properties of the Indians of the prairies—their quick intelligence, their ingenious cunning, their scent of the enemy.A single mistake, a moment's hesitation, a single false step may cause death.On these occasions Yankees are often accompanied by their dogs, and keep up the struggle for hours.

“What demons you are！”cried Michel Ardan, when his companion had depicted this scene to him with much energy.

“Yes, we are，”replied J. T.modestly；“but we had better make haste.”

Though Michel Ardan and he had crossed the plains still wet with dew, and had taken the shortest route over creeks and rice fields, they could not reach Skersnaw in under five hours and a half.

Barbicane must have passed the border half an hour ago.

There was an old bushman working there, occupied in cutting fagots from trees that had been leveled by his axe.

J. T.Maston ran toward him, saying，“Have you seen a man go into the wood, armed with a rifle?Barbicane, the president, my best friend?”

The worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought that his president must be known by all the world. But the bushman did not seem to understand him.

“A hunter?”said Ardan.

“A hunter?Yes，”replied the bushman.

“Long ago?”

“About an hour.”

“Too late！”cried J. T.Maston.

“Have you heard any gunshots?”asked Ardan.

“No！”

“Not one?”

“Not one！that hunter did not look as if he knew how to hunt！”

“What is to be done?”said J. T.Maston.

“We must go into the wood, at the risk of getting a ball which is not intended for us.”

“Ah！”cried J. T.Maston, in a tone which could not be mistaken，“I would rather have twenty balls in my own head than one in Barbicane's.”

“Forward, then，”said Ardan, pressing his companion's hand.

A few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse. It was a dense thicket, in which rose huge cypresses, sycamores, tulip-trees, olives, tamarinds, oaks, and magnolias.These different trees had interwoven their branches into an inextricable maze, through which the eye could not penetrate.Michel Ardan and J.T.Maston walked side by side in silence through the tall grass, cutting themselves a path through the strong creepers, casting curious glances on the bushes, and momentarily expecting to hear the sound of rifles.As for the traces which Barbicane ought to have left of his passage through the wood, there was not a vestige of them visible：so they followed the barely perceptible paths along which Indians had tracked some enemy, and which the dense foliage darkly overshadowed.

After an hour spent in vain pursuit the two stopped in intensified anxiety.

“It must be all over，”said J. T.Maston, discouraged.“A man like Barbicane would not dodge with his enemy, or ensnare him, would not even maneuver！He is too open, too brave.He has gone straight ahead, right into the danger, and doubtless far enough from the bushman for the wind to prevent his hearing the report of the rifles.”

“But surely，”replied Michel Ardan，“since we entered the wood we should have heard！”

“And what if we came too late?”cried J. T.Maston in tones of despair.

For once Ardan had no reply to make, he and J. T.Maston resuming their walk in silence.From time to time, indeed, they raised great shouts, calling alternately Barbicane and Nicholl, neither of whom, however, answered their cries.Only the birds, awakened by the sound, flew past them and disappeared among the branches, while some frightened deer fled precipitately before them.

For another hour their search was continued. The greater part of the wood had been explored.There was nothing to reveal the presence of the combatants.The information of the bushman was after all doubtful, and Ardan was about to propose their abandoning this useless pursuit, when all at once J.T.Maston stopped.

“Hush！”said he，“there is some one down there！”

“Some one?”repeated Michel Ardan.

“Yes；a man！He seems motionless. His rifle is not in his hands.What can he be doing?”

“But can you recognize him?”asked Ardan, whose short sight was of little use to him in such circumstances.

“Yes！Yes！He is turning toward us，”answered J. T.Maston.

“And it is?”

“Captain Nicholl！”

“Nicholl?”cried Michel Ardan, feeling a terrible pang of grief.

“Nicholl unarmed！He has, then, no longer any fear of his adversary！”

“Let us go to him，”said Michel Ardan，“and find out the truth.”

But he and his companion had barely taken fifty steps, when they paused to examine the captain more attentively. They expected to find a bloodthirsty man, happy in his revenge.

On seeing him, they remained stupefied.

A net, composed of very fine meshes, hung between two enormous tulip-trees, and in the midst of this snare, with its wings entangled, was a poor little bird, uttering pitiful cries, while it vainly struggled to escape. The bird-catcher who had laid this snare was no human being, but a venomous spider, peculiar to that country, as large as a pigeon's egg, and armed with enormous claws.The hideous creature, instead of rushing on its prey, had beaten a sudden retreat and taken refuge in the upper branches of the tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy menaced its stronghold.

Here, then, was Nicholl, his gun on the ground, forgetful of danger, trying if possible to save the victim from its cobweb prison. At last it was accomplished, and the little bird flew joyfully away and disappeared.

Nicholl lovingly watched its flight, when he heard these words pronounced by a voice full of emotion：

“You are indeed a brave man.”

He turned. Michel Ardan was before him, repeating in a different tone：

“And a kindhearted one！”

“Michel Ardan！”cried the captain.“Why are you here?”

“To press your hand, Nicholl, and to prevent you from either killing Barbicane or being killed by him.”

“Barbicane！”returned the captain.“I have been looking for him for the last two hours in vain. Where is he hiding?”

“Nicholl！”said Michel Ardan.“This is not courteous！We ought always to treat an adversary with respect；rest assured if Barbicane is still alive we shall find him all the more easily；because if he has not, like you, been amusing himself with freeing oppressed birds, he must be looking for you. When we have found him, Michel Ardan tells you this, there will be no duel between you.”

“Between President Barbicane and myself，”gravely replied Nicholl，“there is a rivalry which the death of one of us—”

“Pooh, pooh！”said Ardan.“Brave fellows like you indeed！You shall not fight！”

“I will fight, sir！”

“No！”

“Captain，”said J. T.Maston, with much feeling，“I am a friend of the president's, his alter ego, his second self；if you really must kill some one, shoot me！It will do just as well！”

“Sir，”Nicholl replied, seizing his rifle convulsively.“these jokes—”

“Our friend J. T.Maston is not joking，”replied Ardan.“I fully understand his idea of being killed himself in order to save his friend.But neither he nor Barbicane will fall before the balls of Captain Nicholl.Indeed I have so attractive a proposal to make to the two rivals, that both will be eager to accept it.”

“What is it?”asked Nicholl with manifest incredulity.

“Patience！”exclaimed Ardan.“I can only reveal it in the presence of Barbicane.”

“Let us go in search of him then！”cried the captain.

The three men started off at once；the captain having discharged his rifle threw it over his shoulder, and advanced in silence.

Another half hour passed, and the pursuit was still fruitless. J.T.Maston was oppressed by sinister forebodings.He looked fiercely at Nicholl, asking himself whether the captain's vengeance had already been satisfied, and the unfortunate Barbicane, shot, was perhaps lying dead on some bloody track.The same thought seemed to occur to Ardan；and both were casting inquiring glances on Nicholl, when suddenly J.T.Maston paused.

The motionless figure of a man leaning against a gigantic catalpa twenty feet off appeared, half-veiled by the foliage.

“It is he！”said J. T.Maston.

Barbicane never moved. Ardan looked at the captain, but he did not wince.Ardan went forward crying：

“Barbicane！Barbicane！”

No answer！Ardan rushed toward his friend；but in the act of seizing his arms, he stopped short and uttered a cry of surprise.

Barbicane, pencil in hand, was tracing geometrical figures in a memorandum book, while his unloaded rifle lay beside him on the ground.

Absorbed in his studies, Barbicane, in his turn forgetful of the duel, had seen and heard nothing.

When Ardan took his hand, he looked up and stared at his visitor in astonishment.

“Ah, it is you！”he cried at last.“I have found it, my friend, I have found it！”

“What?”

“My plan！”

“What plan?”

“The plan for countering the effect of the shock at the departure of the projectile！”

“Indeed?”said Michel Ardan, looking at the captain out of the corner of his eye.

“Yes！Water！Simply water, which will act as a spring—Ah！J. T.Maston，”cried Barbicane，“you here also?”

“Himself，”replied Ardan；“and permit me to introduce to you at the same time the worthy Captain Nicholl！”

“Nicholl！”cried Barbicane, who jumped up at once.“Pardon me, captain, I had quite forgotten—I am ready！”

Michel Ardan interfered, without giving the two enemies time to say anything more.

“Thank heaven！”said he.“It is a happy thing that brave men like you two did not meet sooner！We should now have been mourning for one or other of you. But, thanks to Providence, which has interfered, there is now no further cause for alarm.When one forgets one's anger in mechanics or in cobwebs, it is a sign that the anger is not dangerous.”

Michel Ardan then told the president how the captain had been found occupied.

“I put it to you now，”said he in conclusion，“are two such good fellows as you are made on purpose to smash each other's skulls with shot?”

There was in“the situation”somewhat of the ridiculous, something quite unexpected；Michel Ardan saw this, and determined to effect a reconciliation.

“My good friends，”said he, with his most bewitching smile，“this is nothing but a misunderstanding. Nothing more！Well！To prove that it is all over between you, accept frankly the proposal I am going to make to you.”

“Make it，”said Nicholl.

“Our friend Barbicane believes that his projectile will go straight to the moon?”

“Yes, certainly，”replied the president.

“And our friend Nicholl is persuaded it will fall back upon the earth?”

“I am certain of it，”cried the captain.

“Good！”said Ardan.“I cannot pretend to make you agree；but I suggest this：go with me, and so see whether we are stopped on our journey.”

“What?”exclaimed J. T.Maston, stupefied.

The two rivals, on this sudden proposal, looked steadily at each other. Barbicane waited for the captain's answer.Nicholl watched for the decision of the president.

“Well?”said Michel.“There is now no fear of the shock！”

“Done！”cried Barbicane.

But quickly as he pronounced the word, he was not before Nicholl.

“Hurrah！bravo！hip！hip！hurrah！”cried Michel, giving a hand to each of the late adversaries.“Now that it is all settled, my friends, allow me to treat you after French fashion. Let us be off to breakfast！”





Chapter XXII The New Citizen of the United States


That same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl and President Barbicane, as well as its singular denouement. From that day forth, Michel Ardan had not one moment's rest.Deputations from all corners of the Union harassed him without cessation or intermission.He was compelled to receive them all, whether he would or no.How many hands he shook, how many people he was“hail-fellow-well-met”with, it is impossible to guess！Such a triumphal result would have intoxicated any other man；but he managed to keep himself in a state of delightful semi-tipsiness.

Among the deputations of all kinds which assailed him, that of“The Lunatics”were careful not to forget what they owed to the future conqueror of the moon. One day, certain of these poor people, so numerous in America, came to call upon him, and requested permission to return with him to their native country.

“Singular hallucination！”said he to Barbicane, after having dismissed the deputation with promises to convey numbers of messages to friends in the moon.“Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon distempers?”

“Scarcely！”

“No more do I, despite some remarkable recorded facts of history. For instance, during an epidemic in 1693，a large number of persons died at the very moment of an eclipse.The celebrated Bacon always fainted during an eclipse.Charles VI relapsed six times into madness during the year 1399，sometimes during the new, sometimes during the full moon.Gall observed that insane persons underwent an accession of their disorder twice in every month, at the epochs of new and full moon.In fact, numerous observations made upon fevers, somnambulism, and other human maladies, seem to prove that the moon does exercise some mysterious influence upon man.”

“But the how and the wherefore?”asked Barbicane.

“Well, I can only give you the answer which Arago borrowed from Plutarch, which is nineteen centuries old.‘Perhaps the stories are not true！'”

In the height of his triumph, Michel Ardan had to encounter all the annoyances incidental to a man of celebrity. Managers of entertainments wanted to exhibit him.Barnum offered him a million dollars to make a tour of the United States in his show.As for his photographs, they were sold of all size, and his portrait taken in every imaginable posture.More than half a million copies were disposed of in an incredibly short space of time.

But it was not only the men who paid him homage, but the women as well. He might have married well a hundred times over, if he had been willing to settle in life.The old maids, in particular, of forty years and upward, and dry in proportion, devoured his photographs day and night.They would have married him by hundreds, even if he had imposed upon them the condition of accompanying him into space.He had, however, no intention of transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the surface of the moon.

He therefore declined all offers.

As soon as he could withdraw from these somewhat embarrassing demonstrations, he went, accompanied by his friends, to pay a visit to the Columbiad. He was highly gratified by his inspection, and made the descent to the bottom of the tube of this gigantic machine which was presently to launch him to the regions of the moon.

It is necessary here to mention a proposal of J. T.Maston's.When the secretary of the Gun Club found that Barbicane and Nicholl accepted the proposal of Michel Ardan, he determined to join them, and make one of a smug party of four.So one day he determined to be admitted as one of the travelers.Barbicane, pained at having to refuse him, gave him clearly to understand that the projectile could not possibly contain so many passengers.Maston, in despair, went in search of Michel Ardan, who counseled him to resign himself to the situation, adding one or two arguments ad hominem.

“You see, old fellow，”he said，“you must not take what I say in bad part；but really, between ourselves, you are in too incomplete a condition to appear in the moon！”

“Incomplete?”shrieked the valiant invalid.

“Yes, my dear fellow！Imagine our meeting some of the inhabitants up there！Would you like to give them such a melancholy notion of what goes on down here?To teach them what war is, to inform them that we employ our time chiefly in devouring each other, in smashing arms and legs, and that too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred billions of inhabitants, and which actually does contain nearly two hundred millions?Why, my worthy friend, we should have to turn you out of doors！”

“But still, if you arrive there in pieces, you will be as incomplete as I am.”

“Unquestionably，”replied Michel Ardan；“but we shall not.”

In fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th of October, had yielded the best results and caused the most well-grounded hopes of success. Barbicane, desirous of obtaining some notion of the effect of the shock at the moment of the projectile's departure, had procured a 32-inch mortar from the arsenal of Pensacola.He had this placed on the bank of Hillsborough Bay, in order that the shell might fall back into the sea, and the shock be thereby destroyed.His object was to ascertain the extent of the shock of departure, and not that of the return.

A hollow projectile had been prepared for this curious experiment. A thick padding fastened upon a kind of elastic network, made of the best steel, lined the inside of the walls.It was a veritable nest most carefully wadded.

“What a pity I can't find room in there，”said J. T.Maston, regretting that his height did not allow of his trying the adventure.

Within this shell were shut up a large cat, and a squirrel belonging to J. T.Maston, and of which he was particularly fond.They were desirous, however, of ascertaining how this little animal, least of all others subject to giddiness, would endure this experimental voyage.

The mortar was charged with 160 pounds of powder, and the shell placed in the chamber. On being fired, the projectile rose with great velocity, described a majestic parabola, attained a height of about a thousand feet, and with a graceful curve descended in the midst of the vessels that lay there at anchor.

Without a moment's loss of time a small boat put off in the direction of its fall；some divers plunged into the water and attached ropes to the handles of the shell, which was quickly dragged on board. Five minutes did not elapse between the moment of enclosing the animals and that of unscrewing the coverlid of their prison.

Ardan, Barbicane, J. T.Maston, and Nicholl were present on board the boat, and assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be comprehended.Hardly had the shell been opened when the cat leaped out, slightly bruised, but full of life, and exhibiting no signs whatever of having made an aerial expedition.No trace, however, of the squirrel could be discovered.The truth at last became apparent—the cat had eaten its fellow-traveler！

J. T.Maston grieved much for the loss of his poor squirrel, and proposed to add its case to that of other martyrs to science.

After this experiment all hesitation, all fear disappeared. Besides, Barbicane's plans would ensure greater perfection for his projectile, and go far to annihilate altogether the effects of the shock.Nothing now remained but to go！

Two days later Michel Ardan received a message from the President of the United States, an honor of which he showed himself especially sensible.

After the example of his illustrious fellow-countryman, the Marquis de la Fayette, the government had decreed to him the title of“Citizen of the United States of America”.





Chapter XXIII The Projectile-Vehicle


On the completion of the Columbiad, the public interest centered in the projectile itself, the vehicle which was destined to carry the three hardy adventurers into space.

The new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co.，of Albany, with the request for their speedy execution. The projectile was consequently cast on the 2nd of November, and immediately forwarded by the Eastern Railway to Stones Hill, which it reached without accident on the 10th of that month, where Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl were waiting impatiently for it.

The projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet with a bed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden disc, which worked easily within the walls of the projectile. It was upon this kind of raft that the travelers were to take their place.This body of water was divided by horizontal partitions, which the shock of the departure would have to break in succession.Then each sheet of the water, from the lowest to the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top of the projectile, constituted a kind of spring；and the wooden disc, supplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike the lowest plate except after breaking successively the different partitions.Undoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent recoil after the complete escapement of the water；but the first shock would be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring.The upper parts of the walls were lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened upon springs of the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were completely concealed；thus all imaginable precautions had been taken for averting the first shock；and if they did get crushed, they must, as Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials.

The entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture contrived in the wall of the cone. This was hermetically closed by a plate of aluminum, fastened internally by powerful screw-pressure.The travelers could therefore quit their prison at pleasure, as soon as they should reach the moon.

Light and view were given by means of four thick lenticular glass scuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the third in the bottom, the fourth in the top. These scuttles then were protected against the shock of departure by plates let into solid grooves, which could easily be opened outward by unscrewing them from the inside.Reservoirs firmly fixed contained water and the necessary provisions；and fire and light were procurable by means of gas, contained in a special reservoir under a pressure of several atmospheres.They had only to turn a tap, and for six hours the gas would light and warm this comfortable vehicle.

There now remained only the question of air；for allowing for the consumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two dogs which he proposed taking with him, it was necessary to renew the air of the projectile. Now air consists principally of twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen.The lungs absorb the oxygen, which is indispensable for the support of life, and reject the nitrogen.The air expired loses nearly five per cent of the former and contains nearly an equal volume of carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the elements of the blood.In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain time, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic acid—a gas fatal to life.There were two things to be done then—first, to replace the absorbed oxygen；secondly, to destroy the expired carbonic acid；both easy enough to do, by means of chlorate of potassium and caustic potash.The former is a salt which appears under the form of white crystals；when raised to a temperature of 400 degrees it is transformed into chlorure of potassium, and the oxygen which it contains is entirely liberated.Now eighteen pounds of chlorate of potassium produces seven pounds of oxygen, or 2，400 litres—the quantity necessary for the travelers during twenty-four hours.

Caustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid；and it is sufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid and form bicarbonate of potassium. By these two means they would be enabled to restore to the vitiated air its life-supporting properties.

It is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had hitherto been made in anima vili. Whatever its scientific accuracy was, they were at present ignorant how it would answer with human beings.The honor of putting it to the proof was energetically claimed by J.T.Maston.

“Since I am not to go，”said the brave artillerist，“I may at least live for a week in the projectile.”

It would have been hard to refuse him；so they consented to his wish. A sufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and of caustic potash was placed at his disposal, together with provisions for eight days.And having shaken hands with his friends, on the 12th of November, at six o'clock A.M.，after strictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th, at six o'clock P.M.，he slid down the projectile, the plate of which was at once hermetically sealed.What did he do with himself during that week?They could get no information.The thickness of the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the inside to the outside.On the 20th of November, at six P.M.exactly, the plate was opened.The friends of J.T.Maston had been all along in a state of much anxiety；but they were promptly reassured on hearing a jolly voice shouting a boisterous hurrah.

Presently afterward the secretary of the Gun Club appeared at the top of the cone in a triumphant attitude. He had grown fat！





Chapter XXIV The Telescope of the Rocky Mountains


On the 20th of October in the preceding year, after the close of the subscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the Observatory of Cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction of a gigantic optical instrument. This instrument was designed for the purpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object exceeding nine feet in diameter.

At the period when the Gun Club essayed their great experiment, such instruments had reached a high degree of perfection, and produced some magnificent results. Two telescopes in particular, at this time, were possessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions.The first, constructed by Herschel, was thirty-six feet in length, and had an object-glass of four feet six inches；it possessed a magnifying power of 6，000.The second was raised in Ireland, in Parsonstown Park, and belongs to Lord Rosse.The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and the diameter of its object-glass six feet；it magnifies 6，400 times, and required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the purpose of working it, its weight being twenty-eight thousand pounds.

Still, despite these colossal dimensions, the actual enlargements scarcely exceeded 6，000 times in round numbers；consequently, the moon was brought within no nearer an apparent distance than thirty-nine miles；and objects of less than sixty feet in diameter, unless they were of very considerable length, were still imperceptible.

In the present case, dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter and fifteen feet long, it became necessary to bring the moon within an apparent distance of five miles at most；and for that purpose to establish a magnifying power of 48，000 times.

Such was the question proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge. There was no lack of funds；the difficulty was purely one of construction.

After considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of the proposed instrument the work was finally commenced. According to the calculations of the Observatory of Cambridge, the tube of the new reflector would require to be 280 feet in length, and the object-glass sixteen feet in diameter.Colossal as these dimensions may appear, they were diminutive in comparison with the 10，000 foot telescope proposed by the astronomer Hooke only a few years ago！

Regarding the choice of locality, that matter was promptly determined. The object was to select some lofty mountain, and there are not many of these in the United States.In fact there are but two chains of moderate elevation, between which runs the magnificent Mississippi, the“king of rivers”as these Republican Yankees delight to call it.

Eastwards rise the Appalachians, the very highest point of which, in New Hampshire, does not exceed the very moderate altitude of 5，600 feet.

On the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense range which, commencing at the Straights of Magellan, follows the western coast of Southern America under the name of the Andes or the Cordilleras, until it crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and runs up the whole of North America to the very borders of the Polar Sea. The highest elevation of this range still does not exceed 10，700 feet.With this elevation, nevertheless, the Gun Club were compelled to be content, inasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and Columbiad should be erected within the limits of the Union.All the necessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the summit of Longs Peak, in the territory of Missouri.

Neither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds which the American engineers had to surmount, of the prodigies of daring and skill which they accomplished. They had to raise enormous stones, massive pieces of wrought iron, heavy corner-clamps and huge portions of cylinder, with an object-glass weighing nearly 30，000 pounds, above the line of perpetual snow for more than 10，000 feet in height, after crossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful rapids, far from all centers of population, and in the midst of savage regions, in which every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble problem.And yet, notwithstanding these innumerable obstacles, American genius triumphed.In less than a year after the commencement of the works, toward the close of September, the gigantic reflector rose into the air to a height of 280 feet.It was raised by means of an enormous iron crane；an ingenious mechanism allowed it to be easily worked toward all the points of the heavens, and to follow the stars from the one horizon to the other during their journey through the heavens.

It had cost$400，000. The first time it was directed toward the moon the observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety.What were they about to discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects 48，000 times?Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals, towns, lakes, seas?No！there was nothing which science had not already discovered！and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of the moon became determinable with the utmost precision.

But the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before doing its duty to the Gun Club, rendered immense services to astronomy. Thanks to its penetrative power, the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost extent；the apparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately measured；and Mr.Clark, of the Cambridge staff, resolved the Crab nebula in Taurus, which the reflector of Lord Rosse had never been able to decompose.





Chapter XXV Final Details


It was the 22nd of November；the departure was to take place in ten days. One operation alone remained to be accomplished to bring all to a happy termination；an operation delicate and perilous, requiring infinite precautions, and against the success of which Captain Nicholl had laid his third bet.It was, in fact, nothing less than the loading of the Columbiad, and the introduction into it of 400，000 pounds of gun-cotton.Nicholl had thought, not perhaps without reason, that the handling of such formidable quantities of pyroxyle would, in all probability, involve a grave catastrophe；and at any rate, that this immense mass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite when submitted to the pressure of the projectile.

There were indeed dangers accruing as before from the carelessness of the Americans, but Barbicane had set his heart on success, and took all possible precautions.

In the first place, he was very careful as to the transportation of the gun-cotton to Stones Hill. He had it conveyed in small quantities, carefully packed in sealed cases.These were brought by rail from Tampa Town to the camp, and from thence were taken to the Columbiad by barefooted workmen, who deposited them in their places by means of cranes placed at the orifice of the cannon.No steam-engine was permitted to work, and every fire was extinguished within two miles of the works.

Even in November they feared to work by day, lest the sun's rays acting on the gun-cotton might lead to unhappy results. This led to their working at night, by light produced in a vacuum by means of Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which threw an artificial brightness into the depths of the Columbiad.There the cartridges were arranged with the utmost regularity, connected by a metallic thread, destined to communicate to them all simultaneously the electric spark, by which means this mass of gun-cotton was eventually to be ignited.

By the 28th of November, eight hundred cartridges had been placed in the bottom of the Columbiad. So far the operation had been successful！But what confusion, what anxieties, what struggles were undergone by President Barbicane！In vain had he refused admission to Stones Hill；every day the inquisitive neighbors scaled the palisades, some even carrying their imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by bales of gun-cotton.Barbicane was in a perpetual state of alarm.J.T.Maston seconded him to the best of his ability, by giving vigorous chase to the intruders, and carefully picking up the still lighted cigar ends which the Yankees threw about.A somewhat difficult task！Seeing that more than 300，000 persons were gathered round the enclosure.Michel Ardan had volunteered to superintend the transport of the cartridges to the mouth of the Columbiad；but the president, having surprised him with an enormous cigar in his mouth, while he was hunting out the rash spectators to whom he himself offered so dangerous an example, saw that he could not trust this fearless smoker, and was therefore obliged to mount a special guard over him.

At last, Providence being propitious, this wonderful loading came to a happy termination, Captain Nicholl's third bet being thus lost. It remained now to introduce the projectile into the Columbiad, and to place it on its soft bed of gun-cotton.

But before doing this, all those things necessary for the journey had to be carefully arranged in the projectile vehicle. These necessaries were numerous；and had Ardan been allowed to follow his own wishes, there would have been no space remaining for the travelers.It is impossible to conceive of half the things this charming Frenchman wished to convey to the moon.A veritable stock of useless trifles！But Barbicane interfered and refused admission to anything not absolutely needed.Several thermometers, barometers, and telescopes were packed in the instrument case.

The travelers being desirous of examing the moon carefully during their voyage, in order to facilitate their studies, they took with them Boeer and Moeller's excellent Mappa Selenographica, a masterpiece of patience and observation, which they hoped would enable them to identify those physical features in the moon with which they were acquainted. This map reproduced with scrupulous fidelity the smallest details of the lunar surface which faces the earth；the mountains, valleys, craters, peaks, and ridges were all represented, with their exact dimensions, relative positions, and names；from the mountains Doerfel and Leibnitz on the eastern side of the disc, to the Mare frigoris of the North Pole.

They took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces, and a large quantity of balls, shot, and powder.

“We cannot tell whom we shall have to deal with，”said Michel Ardan.“Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit. It is only wise to take all precautions.”

These defensive weapons were accompanied by pickaxes, crowbars, saws, and other useful implements, not to mention clothing adapted to every temperature, from that of polar regions to that of the torrid zone.

Ardan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts, not indeed a pair of every known species, as he could not see the necessity of acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or any other noxious beasts in the moon.“Nevertheless，”he said to Barbicane，“some valuable and useful beasts, bullocks, cows, horses, and donkeys, would bear the journey very well, and would also be very useful to us.”

“I dare say, my dear Ardan，”replied the president，“but our projectile-vehicle is no Noah's ark, from which it differs both in dimensions and object. Let us confine ourselves to possibilities.”

After a prolonged discussion, it was agreed that the travelers should restrict themselves to a sporting-dog belonging to Nicholl, and to a large Newfoundland. Several packets of seeds were also included among the necessaries.Michel Ardan, indeed, was anxious to add some sacks full of earth to sow them in；as it was, he took a dozen shrubs carefully wrapped up in straw to plant in the moon.

The important question of provisions still remained；it being necessary to provide against the possibility of their finding the moon absolutely barren. Barbicane managed so successfully, that he supplied them with sufficient rations for a year.These consisted of preserved meats and vegetables, reduced by strong hydraulic pressure to the smallest possible dimensions.They were also supplied with brandy, and took water enough for two months, being confident, from astronomical observations, that there was no lack of water on the moon's surface.As to provisions, doubtless the inhabitants of the earth would find nourishment somewhere in the moon.Ardan never questioned this；indeed, had he done so, he would never have undertaken the journey.

“Besides，”he said one day to his friends，“we shall not be completely abandoned by our terrestrial friends；they will take care not to forget us.”

“No, indeed！”replied J. T.Maston.

“Nothing would be simpler，”replied Ardan；“the Columbiad will be always there. Well！Whenever the moon is in a favorable condition as to the zenith, if not to the perigee, that is to say about once a year, could you not send us a shell packed with provisions, which we might expect on some appointed day?”

“Hurrah！hurrah！”cried J. T.Matson.“What an ingenious fellow！What a splendid idea！Indeed, my good friends, we shall not forget you！”

“I shall reckon upon you！Then, you see, we shall receive news regularly from the earth, and we shall indeed be stupid if we hit upon no plan for communicating with our good friends here！”

These words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried all the Gun Club with him in his enthusiasm. What he said seemed so simple and so easy, so sure of success, that none could be so sordidly attached to this earth as to hesitate to follow the three travelers on their lunar expedition.

All being ready at last, it remained to place the projectile in the Columbiad, an operation abundantly accompanied by dangers and difficulties.

The enormous shell was conveyed to the summit of Stones Hill. There, powerful cranes raised it, and held it suspended over the mouth of the well of metal.

It was a fearful moment！What if the chains should break under its enormous weight?The sudden fall of such a body would inevitably cause the gun-cotton to explode！

Fortunately this did not happen；and some hours later the projectile-vehicle descended gently into the heart of the cannon and rested on its couch of pyroxyle, a veritable bed of explosive eider-down. Its pressure had no result, other than the more effectual ramming down of the charge in the Columbiad.

“I have lost，”said the captain, who forthwith paid President Barbicane the sum of three thousand dollars.

Barbicane did not wish to accept the money from one of his fellow-travelers, but gave way at last before the determination of Nichol who wished before leaving the earth to fulfill all his engagements.

“Now，”said Michel Ardan，“I have only one thing more to wish for you, my brave captain.”

“What is that?”asked Nicholl.

“It is that you may lose your two other bets！Then we shall be sure not to be stopped on our journey！”





Chapter XXVI Fire！


The first of December had arrived！The fatal day！For if the projectile were not discharged that very night at 10h. 46m.40s.P.M.，more than eighteen years must roll by before the moon would again present herself under the same conditions of zenith and perigee.

The weather was magnificent. Despite the approach of winter, the sun shone brightly, and bathed in its radiant light that earth which three of its denizens were about to abandon for a new world.

How many persons lost their rest on the night which preceded this long-expected day！All hearts beat with disquietude, save only the heart of Michel Ardan. That imperturbable personage came and went with his habitual business-like air, while nothing whatever denoted that any unusual matter preoccupied his mind.

After dawn, an innumerable multitude covered the prairie which extends, as far as the eye can reach, round Stones Hill. Every quarter of an hour the railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers；and, according to the statement of the Tampa Town Observer, not less than five millions of spectators thronged the soil of Florida.

For a whole month previously, the mass of these persons had bivouacked round the enclosure, and laid the foundations for a town which was afterward called“Ardan's Town”. The whole plain was covered with huts, cottages, and tents.Every nation under the sun was represented there；and every language might be heard spoken at the same time.It was a perfect Babel re-enacted.All the various classes of American society were mingled together in terms of absolute equality.Bankers, farmers, sailors, cotton-planters, brokers, merchants, watermen, magistrates, elbowed each other in the most free-and-easy way.Louisiana Creoles fraternized with farmers from Indiana；Kentucky and Tennessee gentlemen and haughty Virginians conversed with trappers and the half-savages of the lakes and butchers from Cincinnati.Broad-brimmed white hats and Panamas, blue-cotton trousers, light-colored stockings, cambric frills, were all here displayed；while upon shirt-fronts, wristbands, and neckties, upon every finger, even upon the very ears, they wore an assortment of rings, shirt-pins, brooches, and trinkets, of which the value only equaled the execrable taste.Women, children, and servants, in equally expensive dress, surrounded their husbands, fathers, or masters, who resembled the patriarchs of tribes in the midst of their immense households.

At meal-times all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the Southern States, and consumed with an appetite that threatened speedy exhaustion of the victualing powers of Florida, fricasseed frogs, stuffed monkey, fish chowder, underdone possum, and raccoon steaks. And as for the liquors which accompanied this indigestible repast！The shouts, the vociferations that resounded through the bars and taverns decorated with glasses, tankards, and bottles of marvelous shape, mortars for pounding sugar, and bundles of straws！“Mint-julep”roars one of the barmen；“Claret sangaree！”shouts another；“Cocktail！”“Brandy-smash！”“Real mint-julep in the new style！”All these cries intermingled produced a bewildering and deafening hubbub.

But on this day，1st of December, such sounds were rare. No one thought of eating or drinking, and at four P.M.there were vast numbers of spectators who had not even taken their customary lunch！And, a still more significant fact, even the national passion for play seemed quelled for the time under the general excitement of the hour.

Up till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as precedes great catastrophes, ran through the anxious multitude. An indescribable uneasiness pervaded all minds, an indefinable sensation which oppressed the heart.Every one wished it was over.

However, about seven o'clock, the heavy silence was dissipated. The moon rose above the horizon.Millions of hurrahs hailed her appearance.She was punctual to the rendezvous, and shouts of welcome greeted her on all sides, as her pale beams shone gracefully in the clear heavens.At this moment the three intrepid travelers appeared.This was the signal for renewed cries of still greater intensity.Instantly the vast assemblage, as with one accord, struck up the national hymn of the United States, and“Yankee Doodle”，sung by five million of hearty throats, rose like a roaring tempest to the farthest limits of the atmosphere.Then a profound silence reigned throughout the crowd.

The Frenchman and the two Americans had by this time entered the enclosure reserved in the center of the multitude. They were accompanied by the members of the Gun Club, and by deputations sent from all the European Observatories.Barbicane, cool and collected, was giving his final directions.Nicholl, with compressed lips, his arms crossed behind his back, walked with a firm and measured step.Michel Ardan, always easy, dressed in thorough traveler's costume, leathern gaiters on his legs, pouch by his side, in loose velvet suit, cigar in mouth, was full of inexhaustible gayety, laughing, joking, playing pranks with J.T.Maston.In one word, he was the thorough“Frenchman”（and worse, a“Parisian”）to the last moment.

Ten o'clock struck！The moment had arrived for taking their places in the projectile！The necessary operations for the descent, and the subsequent removal of the cranes and scaffolding that inclined over the mouth of the Columbiad, required a certain period of time.

Barbicane had regulated his chronometer to the tenth part of a second by that of Murchison the engineer, who was charged with the duty of firing the gun by means of an electric spark. Thus the travelers enclosed within the projectile were enabled to follow with their eyes the impassive needle which marked the precise moment of their departure.

The moment had arrived for saying“good-bye！”The scene was a touching one. Despite his feverish gayety, even Michel Ardan was touched.J.T.Maston had found in his own dry eyes one ancient tear, which he had doubtless reserved for the occasion.He dropped it on the forehead of his dear president.

“Can I not go?”he said，“There is still time！”

“Impossible, old fellow！”replied Barbicane. A few moments later, the three fellow-travelers had ensconced themselves in the projectile, and screwed down the plate which covered the entrance-aperture.The mouth of the Columbiad, now completely disencumbered, was open entirely to the sky.

The moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness, outshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars. She passed over the constellation of the Twins, and was now nearing the halfway point between the horizon and the zenith.

A terrible silence weighed upon the entire scene！Not a breath of wind upon the earth！Not a sound of breathing from the countless chests of the spectators！Their hearts seemed afraid to beat！All eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of the Columbiad.

Murchison followed with his eye the hand of his chronometer. It wanted scarce forty seconds to the moment of departure, but each second seemed to last an age！At the twentieth there was a general shudder, as it occurred to the minds of that vast assemblage that the bold travelers shut up within the projectile were also counting those terrible seconds.Some few cries here and there escaped the crowd.

“Thirty-five！—thirty-six！—thirty-seven！—thirty-eight！—thirty-nine！—forty FIRE！”

Instantly Murchison pressed with his finger the key of the electric battery, restored the current of the fluid, and discharged the spark into the breech of the Columbiad.

An appalling unearthly report followed instantly, such as can be compared to nothing whatever known, not even to the roar of thunder, or the blast of volcanic explosions！No words can convey the slightest idea of the terrific sound！An immense spout of fire shot up from the bowels of the earth as from a crater. The earth heaved up, and with great difficulty some few spectators obtained a momentary glimpse of the projectile victoriously cleaving the air in the midst of the fiery vapors！





Chapter XXVII Foul Weather


At the moment when that pyramid of fire rose to a prodigious height into the air, the glare of flame lit up the whole of Florida；and for a moment day superseded night over a considerable extent of the country. This immense canopy of fire was perceived at a distance of one hundred miles out at sea, and more than one ship's captain entered in his log the appearance of this gigantic meteor.

The discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake. Florida was shaken to its very depths.The gases of the powder, expanded by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous violence, and this artificial hurricane rushed like a water-spout through the air.

Not a single spectator remained on his feet！Men, women children, all lay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest. There ensued a terrible tumult；a large number of persons were seriously injured.J.T.Maston, who, despite all dictates of prudence, had kept in advance of the mass, was pitched back 20 toises, shooting like a projectile over the heads of his fellow-citizens.Three hundred thousand persons remained deaf for a time, and as though struck stupefied.

As soon as the first effects were over, the injured, the deaf, and lastly, the crowd in general, woke up with frenzied cries.“Hurrah for Ardan！Hurrah for Barbicane！Hurrah for Nicholl！”rose to the skies. Thousands of persons, noses in air, armed with telescopes and race-glasses, were questioning space, forgetting all contusions and emotions in the one idea of watching for the projectile.They looked in vain！It was no longer to be seen, and they were obliged to wait for telegrams from Longs Peak.The director of the Cambridge Observatory was at his post on the Rocky Mountains；and to him, as a skillful and persevering astronomer, all observations had been confided.

But an unforeseen phenomenon came in to subject the public impatience to a severe trial.

The weather, hitherto so fine, suddenly changed；the sky became heavy with clouds. It could not have been otherwise after the terrible derangement of the atmospheric strata, and the dispersion of the enormous quantity of vapor arising from the combustion of 400，000 pounds of pyroxyle！

On the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds—a thick and impenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily extended as far as the Rocky Mountains. It was a fatality！But since man had chosen so to disturb the atmosphere, he was bound to accept the consequences of his experiment.

Supposing, now, that the experiment had succeeded, the travelers having started on the 1st of December, at 10h. 46m.40s.P.M.，were due on the 4th at 0h.P.M.at their destination.So that up to that time it would have been very difficult after all to have observed, under such conditions, a body so small as the shell.Therefore they waited with what patience they might.

From the 4th to the 6th of December inclusive, the weather remaining much the same in America, the great European instruments of Herschel, Rosse, and Foucault, were constantly directed toward the moon, for the weather was then magnificent；but the comparative weakness of their glasses prevented any trustworthy observations being made.

On the 7th the sky seemed to lighten. They were in hopes now, but their hope was of but short duration, and at night again thick clouds hid the starry vault from all eyes.

Matters were now becoming serious, when on the 9th the sun reappeared for an instant, as if for the purpose of teasing the Americans. It was received with hisses；and wounded, no doubt, by such a reception, showed itself very sparing of its rays.

On the 10th, no change！J. T.Maston went nearly mad, and great fears were entertained regarding the brain of this worthy individual, which had hitherto been so well preserved within his gutta-percha cranium.

But on the 11th one of those inexplicable tempests peculiar to those intertropical regions was let loose in the atmosphere. A terrific east wind swept away the groups of clouds which had been so long gathering, and at night the semi-disc of the orb of night rode majestically amid the soft constellations of the sky.





Chapter XXVIII A New Star


That very night, the startling news so impatiently awaited, burst like a thunderbolt over the United States of the Union, and thence, darting across the ocean, ran through all the telegraphic wires of the globe. The projectile had been detected, thanks to the gigantic reflector of Longs Peak！Here is the note received by the director of the Observatory of Cambridge.It contains the scientific conclusion regarding this great experiment of the Gun Club.

LONGS PEAK, December 12.

To the Officers of the Observatory of Cambridge.

The projectile discharged by the Columbiad at Stones Hill has been detected by Messrs. Belfast and J.T.Maston，12th of December, at 8：47 P.M.，the moon having entered her last quarter.

This projectile has not arrived at its destination. It has passed by the side；but sufficiently near to be retained by the lunar attraction.

The rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion of extreme velocity, and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round the moon, of which it has become a true satellite.

The elements of this new star we have as yet been unable to determine；we do not yet know the velocity of its passage. The distance which separates it from the surface of the moon may be estimated at about 2，833 miles.

However, two hypotheses come here into our consideration.

Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing them into itself, and the travelers will attain their destination；or, the projectile, following an immutable law, will continue to gravitate round the moon till the end of time.

At some future time, our observations will be able to determine this point, but till then the experiment of the Gun Club can have no other result than to have provided our solar system with a new star.

J. M.BELFAST.

To how many questions did this unexpected denouement give rise?What mysterious results was the future reserving for the investigation of science?At all events, the names of Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan were certain to be immortalized in the annals of astronomy！

When the dispatch from Longs Peak had once become known, there was but one universal feeling of surprise and alarm. Was it possible to go to the aid of these bold travelers?No！For they had placed themselves beyond the pale of humanity, by crossing the limits imposed by the Creator on his earthly creatures.They had air enough for two months；they had victuals enough for twelve；—but after that?

There was only one man who would not admit that the situation was desperate—he alone had confidence；and that was their devoted friend, J. T.Maston.

Besides, he never let them get out of sight. His home was henceforth the post at Long's Peak；his horizon, the mirror of that immense reflector.As soon as the moon rose above the horizon, he immediately caught her in the field of the telescope；he never let her go for an instant out of his sight, and followed her assiduously in her course through the stellar spaces.He watched with untiring patience the passage of the projectile across her silvery disc, and really the worthy man remained in perpetual communication with his three friends, whom he did not despair of seeing again some day.

“Those three men，”said he，“have carried into space all the resources of art, science, and industry. With that, one can do anything；and you will see that, some day, they will come out all right.”
