第一章　体育馆后


那是一个阴沉的秋日，吉尔·波尔躲在体育馆后面哭泣。

她哭是因为他们一直欺负她。这不是一个校园故事，所以我尽可能少说吉尔学校里的事情，那也不是一个令人开心的话题。这是一所男女同校的学校，一所男女生兼收的学校。这种学校过去也被称作“混合”学校，有人说，这里混乱的程度远不如办这所学校的人的脑袋混乱。这些人认为，男孩和女孩应该被允许做他们喜欢做的事情。然而，不幸的是，其中十个或十五个年龄最大的男孩和女孩最喜欢做的事情就是欺负别人。如果普通学校中发生了任何可怕的事情，不到半个学期就会被发现并被制止，但是在这所学校里面不会如此。即便会，那些做这些坏事的人也不会被开除或是被惩罚。校长说，他们都是很有趣的心理学案例，于是找他们来，和他们谈上好几个钟头。而如果你知道哪些事情适合和校长说，那么最可能出现的结果就是，你会成为很讨校长喜欢的人。

正因如此，在一个阴沉的秋日，吉尔·波尔才在体育馆后面和灌木丛之间的一条潮湿的小路上哭泣。她还没哭够，就有一个男孩，双手插在口袋里，拐过体育馆吹着口哨而来，差一点儿就撞在了吉尔的身上。

“你走路就不能看着点儿吗？”吉尔·波尔说。

“好吧，”男孩说，“你不用一开始……”然后他看到了她的脸，“我说，波尔，”他说，“怎么啦？”

吉尔只是做了个鬼脸，那种你想说些什么却发现一旦说话就会又哭起来时做的鬼脸。

“是他们，我猜，……一向如此。”男孩严肃地说，他的手往口袋里面插得更深了。

吉尔点点头。即便她能说话，也没有必要说什么了。因为他们两个都明白。

“好了，你瞧，”男孩说，“我们这样可没有什么用处……”

他的本意是好的，但他说起话来就像讲课一样。吉尔突然间就发起了脾气（如果你哭着的时候被人打断了，很可能也会出现这种状况）。

“噢，走开，管好你自己的事。”她说，“没人让你来多管闲事，是不是？你跑来说什么我们该怎么做，真是个大好人，是不是？我猜你是想说，我们应该把时间都用来奉承他们，像你一样拍他们马屁，大献殷勤。”

“啊，天啊！”男孩说着坐在了灌木丛边缘长满草的土坡上，但他很快又站了起来，因为草湿漉漉的。他的名字不幸叫作尤斯塔斯·斯克罗布　，但他不是个坏孩子。

“波尔！”他说，“你这么说公平吗？我这个学期做过任何这样的事情吗？我没有因为兔子的事情和卡特起冲突吗？我不是守住了斯皮温斯的秘密——即便受了折磨也没有说吗？还有我没有……”

“我……不知道，我也不关心。”吉尔抽泣着说。

斯克罗布看她还没有完全平静下来，就非常明智地给了她一颗薄荷糖。他自己也吃了一颗。很快，吉尔开始头脑清醒地看待事情了。

“抱歉，斯克罗布，”她立刻说，“我那么说不公平。这个学期……你是做了好多事。”

“如果可以的话，就忘了上个学期吧，”尤斯塔斯说，“我那时和现在不是同一个人。我原来……天啊，我那时候是个多坏的讨厌鬼啊！”

“好吧，说实话，你当时的确是。”吉尔说。

“那你觉得我现在有改变吗？”尤斯塔斯说。

“不仅我觉得，”吉尔说，“大家都这么说。他们都注意到了。昨天埃莉诺·布莱基斯顿听到阿黛拉·彭尼法瑟在女更衣室说这件事呢。她说：‘得有人去管管那个叫斯克罗布的孩子了，他这个学期可真不听话。我们接下来真得去关照关照他了。’”

尤斯塔斯不禁一阵哆嗦。实验学校里的每个人都知道被他们“关照”是什么意思。

两个孩子沉默了一阵子。水滴从月桂树的叶子上滴落下来。

“你上个学期怎么会与现在如此不同呢？”过了一会儿，吉尔问。

“假期时，在我身上发生了很多奇怪的事情。”尤斯塔斯神秘兮兮地说。

“什么样的事？”吉尔问。

有好一阵子，尤斯塔斯一句话也没有说。之后，他说道：“你瞧，波尔，你和我都讨厌这个地方，要多讨厌有多讨厌，是不是？”

“我知道我是。”吉尔说。

“那我就真的认为我可以信任你了。”

“你真是太好了。”吉尔说。

“是的，但这真的是个非常重大的秘密。波尔，我说，你会相信某些事情吗？我是说那种这里每个人都会取笑的事情。”

“我从来都没有碰到过呢，”吉尔说，“但我觉得我会信。”

“如果我跟你说，我离开了这个世界——到了这个世界之外的地方——就在上个假期，你会相信吗？”

“我听不懂你在说什么。”

“好吧，那咱们就不扯什么世界了。假设，我跟你说，我去了一个地方，那里动物能说话，那里还有……呃……还有魔法和龙……还有……嗯，所有你在童话中会见到的东西。”斯克罗布说这些话时，觉得非常尴尬，脸都涨红了。

“你是怎么到那里的？”吉尔说。她也莫名地害羞起来。

“你唯一能去那里的方式——就是通过魔法。”尤斯塔斯几乎是在说悄悄话了，“我和我的两个表亲一起去的。我们嗖的一下就去了。他们以前就去过那儿。”

因为他们是在说悄悄话，不知怎的，吉尔就觉得这事比较容易相信了。这时，突然之间，一个可怕的猜想突然出现在她心里，她说（怒气冲冲的，像只母老虎一般）：“如果让我发现你在拿我取乐，我就绝不再和你说话了，绝不，绝不，绝不！”

“我没有。”尤斯塔斯说，“我发誓我没有。我发誓——以一切发誓。”

（我上学的时候，如果一个人要发誓，会说：“我以《圣经》发誓。”但在实验学校里面，《圣经》是不被提倡的。）

“好吧，”吉尔说，“我会相信你。”

“然后谁也不告诉？”

“你把我当什么人了？”

他们说这些时非常激动，说完后，吉尔打量四周，看到了阴沉的秋日天空，听到水滴从树叶上滴落的声音，想着实验学校里面毫无希望的一切（这个学期有十三个星期，而现在，还剩下十一个），她说：“但说到底，又有什么用呢？我们不在那个世界里：我们在这个世界里。我们根本没办法到那里。还是我们可以？”

“我也一直在想这个呢。”尤斯塔斯说，“我们从那个地方回来后，有人说，那两个佩文西家的孩子（也就是我那两个表亲）再也去不了那里了。要知道，那是他们第三次去那里。我猜，他们已经把可以去的次数用光了。但他从没有说我不能再去。他的意思应该是我还可以再回去，否则他肯定会对我说同样的话，是不是？所以，我就忍不住想，我们能不能……能不能去……？”

“你是说，我们应该做点儿什么，这样就可以去那个世界了？”

尤斯塔斯点了点头。

“你是说，我们也许可以在地上画一个圈——然后在里面写下一些奇怪的字母——然后站在圈里——然后背诵几段咒语？”

“好吧，”尤斯塔斯认真地思考了一会儿才回答，“我相信这正是我所想的，不过我从来没试过。但既然说到这点了，我觉得那些圈子啊什么的都是胡说八道，他不会喜欢的。这样做看起来就像是我们认为我们可以命令他做那样的事情。但实际上，我们只能请　求他。”

“你一直在说的这个人到底是谁啊？”

“在那个地方，他们叫他阿斯兰。”尤斯塔斯说。

“这名字可真奇怪！”

“还不及他本人一半奇怪。”尤斯塔斯郑重地说，“咱们继续吧，反正也不会有什么坏处，问问也无妨。咱俩肩并肩站着，就这样。然后把胳膊伸到前方，手心朝下，就像他们在拉曼杜的岛上的做法一样……”

“谁的岛？”

“下次再告诉你。他也许会喜欢我们面朝东方。让我们看看，哪边是东？”

“我不知道。”吉尔说。

“女孩们的特别之处就是，她们从来都搞不明白方向。”尤斯塔斯说。

“你也搞不明白。”吉尔愤愤不平地说。

“我能，只要你别总打断我。我现在搞明白了。那边是东，面对月桂树。现在，你能重复我说的话吗？”

“什么话？”吉尔问。

“当然是我要说的话了。”尤斯塔斯回答，“注意……”

然后，他开始了：“阿斯兰，阿斯兰，阿斯兰！”

“阿斯兰，阿斯兰，阿斯兰！”吉尔重复道。

“请让我们两个进入……”

就在这时，一个声音从体育馆的另一面传来，那声音喊道：“波尔？是的。我知道她在哪里。她躲在体育馆后面哭哭啼啼呢。要我去把她揪出来吗？”

吉尔和尤斯塔斯对望一眼，然后赶忙躲到了月桂树下，顺着灌木丛所在的陡峭土坡往上爬，速度飞快，足够为他们赢得很好的成绩。（由于实验学校古怪的教学方法，在这里学不到多少法语、数学或拉丁语之类的东西，却可以学会很多在他们寻找你时迅速而安静地逃离的方法。）

爬了大约一分钟后，他们停下来听了听，根据听到的动静可知，有人跟着他们。

“但愿能够再次打开那扇门！”斯克罗布说，吉尔点了点头，他们继续向上爬。灌木丛的顶上有一道高高的石墙，墙上有一道门，出去就是开阔的荒野。这扇门基本上都是锁着的。但也有几次人们发现它是开着的。可能只有那么一次。但你应该可以想象出来，即便仅有一次，也会让人们一直期待着，去试试那扇门开没开，因为如果它碰巧没有上锁，那就是一条偷偷溜出校园的绝佳通道。

吉尔和尤斯塔斯在月桂树丛下弯着腰跑了一路，都热得要命，浑身脏兮兮的，气喘吁吁地跑到了墙边。而那扇门，如同以往一样，是锁着的。

“肯定不会有用啊！”尤斯塔斯把手握在了门把手上，然后，“哦哦哦，我的天啊！”门把手转动，门打开了。

就在刚才，他们两个都想，只要门没有上锁，他们就飞快地跑出门去。但现在，门真的是开着的，他们却都站在原地，一动也不动。因为他们透过门看到的，和他们预想的，截然不同。

他们本以为会看到荒野上灰色的、长满石南丛的山坡一路向上，向上，和阴沉的秋日天空融为一体。然而，迎接他们的却是耀眼的阳光。阳光照进门口，就如同你打开车库的门，六月的阳光斜射进来一样。阳光照得草叶上的水滴如同珍珠一般闪闪发光，也使得吉尔挂着泪痕的脸蛋显得更脏。他们断定阳光是从一个截然不同的世界中照射过来的——他们看得到那个世界。他们看到了柔嫩的草地，吉尔从没有见过这么柔嫩这么明艳的草地，还有湛蓝的天空，还有一些飞来飞去、特别明艳的东西，可能是珠宝或是巨大的　蝴蝶。

尽管吉尔一直都渴望能遇到这样的事情，不过现在她有点儿被吓到了。她看了看斯克罗布的脸，看到他也被吓到了。

“来吧，波尔。”他用一种透不过气来的声音说。

“我们还回得来吗？那里安全吗？”吉尔问。

就在这个时候，一个刻薄、恶毒的小嗓门在他们后方喊道：“好啦，波尔，”那声音尖叫着，“大家都知道你在那里，下来。”这是伊迪斯·杰科尔的声音，她还不算是他们中的一员，不过是他们的跟班，给他们跑腿打小报告的人。

“快点儿！”斯克罗布说，“来，握着我的手。我们不能分开。”吉尔还没有意识到怎么回事，他就一把抓住她的手，拉着她穿过了那扇门，走出校园，走出英国，走出我们的整个世界，到了“那个地方”。

伊迪斯·杰科尔的声音立刻就消失了，就仿佛收音机被关掉了一般。而与此同时，一种完全不同的声音包围了他们。那声音是头顶那些明艳的东西发出来的，现在他们能看清楚了，是鸟儿。它们发出了一片喧闹之声，不过，这声音与我们这个世界里的鸟儿的歌声相比，更像是音乐——非常现代化的音乐，刚开始听可能没有办法领会。然而，尽管有歌声，四周环境却无比寂静。这种寂静，加上这里新鲜的空气，令吉尔觉得，他们现在肯定是在一座非常高的山顶上。

斯克罗布依然握着她的手，他们一边向前走，一边打量着周围的一切。吉尔看到四面八方都长着巨大的树木，这树木很像雪松，却比雪松更高大。但这些树之间的距离并不近，而且也没有矮树丛，无遮无拦，无论是向森林的左边看，还是向右边看，都能望出很远。就吉尔目力所及，周围景色大体相同——平缓的草地，长着黄色或蜻蜓蓝或彩虹色羽毛的飞鸟，冷森森的阴影，一片空荡荡。凉爽而明亮的空气中没有一丝风。这真是一片非常孤寂的森林。

他们的正前方没有树，只有蓝色的天空。他们一直向前走，没有说话。突然，吉尔听到斯克罗布说：“小心！”然后觉得自己被向后猛地一拉。原来他们正站在一处悬崖的边缘。

碰巧吉尔是那种站在高处依然头脑清醒的人。她一点儿都不在意站在峭壁边缘。她甚至有点儿恼火斯克罗布向后拉她——“显得我像个小孩一样。”她说着，把手从他手里挣了出来。她看到斯克罗布的脸此刻变得十分苍白，便有点儿看不起他。

“怎么了？”她问。为了显示自己不害怕，她真的站到了非常靠近悬崖边的地方，实际上，她站的地方比她自己心里想站的地方还要靠边很多。然后她向下望。

这时，她意识到斯克罗布的确有理由脸色发白，因为我们的世界中没有一处悬崖能与这个相比。想象一下你自己站在你所知道的最高的悬崖顶上。再想象一下你正俯视着这处悬崖的最底部。然后想象一下悬崖一直往下延伸，越来越深，比这里深十倍，深二十倍。当你向下俯视那么长的距离，想象你看到一些小小的白色的东西，起初第一眼，你可能以为那是羊群，但很快你发现那其实是云——不是雾气形成的小云卷，而是巨大的棉花状的白云，一团团的，就如同你见过的最大的山一样大。最后，透过云层的缝隙，你终于瞥到了真正的底部，由于距离太遥远了，你根本看不清下面是田野还是树林，是陆地还是水面，崖底距离云层的距离，比你和云层的距离还要远得多。

吉尔盯着悬崖底部。这时，她想，也许她应该后退一两步，离边缘远点儿，不过她又不愿意退，她不想让斯克罗布觉得她是因为害怕才这么做的。然后，她突然间决定，不必在乎他怎么想，她巴不得离那可怕的边缘远远的，从此以后再也不笑话那些恐高的人了。但当她想要挪动的时候，她发现自己动不了了。她的腿似乎被定住了。眼前的一切都在飞速移动。

“你在做什么，波尔？快回来——你这个十足的小傻瓜！”斯克罗布喊道。不过他的声音似乎来自很远的地方。她感到他拉住了她，但是现在，她没有办法控制自己的胳膊和腿。有那么一会儿，她在悬崖边上挣扎着。吉尔太害怕了，晕乎乎的，完全不知道自己做了什么。但有两件事，只要她活着，就不会忘记（这两件事情经常出现在她的梦里）。其一，她挣脱了斯克罗布紧拉着她的手；其二，与此同时，尤斯塔斯惨叫一声，失去平衡，摔向深渊。

幸运的是，她没有来得及思考自己到底做了什么，一个色彩鲜艳的巨兽就冲到了悬崖的边缘，那家伙卧低身子，向前探着，然后吹气。这是最奇怪的一点，它没有吼叫，也没有喷响鼻，而是把嘴张得大大的吹气，持续不断地吹气，就好像真空吸尘器持续吸气那样。吉尔躺着的地方离这只动物非常近，她甚至能感觉到空气稳稳地从他体内流出时的震颤。因为站不起来，她只好一动不动地躺着。她差一点儿就晕过去了，实际上，她真希望自己晕了过去，不过晕厥没有听从她的召唤。最后，她看到，在她下方很远很远的地方，一个小小的黑点正轻轻地向上，飘着离开悬崖。那黑点越飘越高，越飘越远。等飘到和悬崖顶差不多高度时，那黑点就已经远得看不到了。很显然，那黑点在以飞快的速度离开他们。吉尔不禁想，一定是她身边的这家伙把那黑点吹走的。

她扭头看过去。那是一头狮子。





第二章　吉尔得到一项任务


狮子看都没看吉尔一眼，就站起身来，又吹了最后一口气。然后，他仿佛很满意自己的成果，转身悄无声息地缓缓离开，向树林走去。

“这肯定是一场梦，肯定是，肯定是。”吉尔对自己说，“我很快就会醒来。”但这并不是梦，她也没有醒来。

“我真希望我们从没来过这个鬼地方，”吉尔说，“我相信斯克罗布对这里的了解一点儿都不比我多。他要是了解的话，不应该不提前警告我这里是什么样子，就把我带过来。他摔下悬崖不是我的错。如果他不管我，我们两个都会好好的。”然后，她又想起了斯克罗布摔下去时的惨叫声，她放声大哭起来。

大哭一场固然痛快，但你迟早得停下来，然后还得决定该做什么。吉尔停止哭泣的时候，发现自己渴得要命。原来她一直脸朝下趴在地上，这时，她坐起了身子。鸟儿已经不再唱了，此时万籁俱寂，只有一个小小的持续不断的声音，那声音似乎是从很遥远的地方传来的。她认真听着，几乎可以肯定那是流水的声音。

吉尔站起身，非常仔细地打量了一下四周。狮子的踪迹早已消失；不过周围有那么多树，他极有可能就待在附近，只是她看不到而已。根据她的知识，这里可能有好多狮子。但是她渴得厉害，只好鼓足勇气，出发去寻找流水。她踮着脚尖走路，谨慎地从一棵树悄悄挪到另一棵树背后，每走一步都停下来观察一下四周。

森林里非常安静，不难判断出水声是从哪里传来的。水流的声音愈来愈清晰，她没想到这么快就来到一片开阔的空地，看到了那道溪流，溪水明亮得像玻璃一样，绕着草地奔流，就在距离她一步之遥的地方。尽管看到水，让她感觉又渴了十倍，不过她并没有急匆匆跑上前去喝。相反，她仿佛变成了石头，一动不动地站着，嘴张得大大的。而她之所以这样做，理由非常充分，因为狮子就卧在溪流的这一边。

狮子卧在地上，头抬着，两只前爪探在身前，像特拉法尔加广场上的狮子雕塑一样。她立刻就知道他看到了她，因为他直直地望了她一阵，之后才转移视线——就仿佛他非常了解她，并不太在意她。

“如果我现在跑开，他很快就能追上我。”吉尔想，“如果我向前走，就会直接跑进他的嘴里。”总之，她就算想动，也动不了，她的视线一刻也不敢从那头狮子身上挪开。这情形到底持续了多久，她无法确定，似乎有好几个小时。而她越来越渴，她甚至都觉得只要能够先喝上一口水，就算被狮子吃掉也在所不惜。

“如果你渴了，你可以喝。”

这是自从斯克罗布在悬崖边跟她说过话后，她听到的第一句话。有一秒钟，她看看这里，看看那里，想知道到底是谁在说话。然后那个声音又说：“如果你渴了，过来喝吧。”她当然想起了斯克罗布说过在另外的世界里，动物是可以说话的，然后意识到这是狮子在说话。反正，这一次，她看到了他的嘴唇在动，而且这声音也不像人的声音。那是一种更深沉、更野性、更有力的声音，是一种庄重而高贵的声音。这声音没有让她变得不那么害怕，反而令她感觉到了一种完全不同的恐惧。

“你不渴吗？”狮子说。

“我要渴死了。”吉尔说。

“那就喝吧。”狮子说。

“我可不可以……我能不能……我喝水的时候能不能请你走开一些？”吉尔问。

狮子的回答只是一个眼神和一声非常低的轻吼。吉尔看着他一动不动的身体，感觉自己像是在要求整座高山为了方便她而挪到旁边一样。

溪流令人开心的潺潺声引得她就要疯了。

“你能保证不——不对我做任何事情吗，如果我过去的话？”吉尔问。

“我不保证。”狮子说。

吉尔现在太渴了，她竟然不知不觉地向前挪了一步。

“你吃女孩吗？”她说。

“我曾吞过女孩和男孩，女人和男人，国王和皇帝，城市和王国。”狮子说。他说这话并不像是在吹牛，似乎也不觉得抱歉或是愤怒。他只是随口说说而已。

“我不敢过去喝水。”吉尔说。

“那你会渴死。”狮子说。

“啊，天啊！”吉尔说着又走近了一步，“我觉得我必须离开这里，去寻找另一条小溪。”

“这里没有别的小溪。”狮子说。

吉尔丝毫不怀疑狮子的话——任何人只要看过他严峻的脸，就不会对他心生怀疑——她突然下了决心。这可能是她做过的最糟糕的事情了，但她还是向前走到小溪边，跪在地上，用手掬起水。这是她喝过的最冷洌、最清凉的水了。你不需要喝太多，因为它能瞬间解你的渴。在喝到水之前，她本来决定，只要一喝完水，就立刻从狮子身边逃走。但现在，她意识到，那应该会是所有事情中最危险的。她站起身，站在那里，嘴唇湿漉漉的。

“过来。”狮子说。她不得不过去。她几乎走到了狮子的两个前爪中间，两眼直直地对着他的脸。但她没有办法坚持太久，很快就垂下了眼帘。

“人类的孩子，”狮子说，“那个男孩去哪儿了？”

“他摔下悬崖了。”吉尔说，然后又补充道，“先生。”她不知道除此之外还应该怎么称呼狮子，可是，不加个称呼，又显得很没有礼貌。

“他是怎么摔下去的，人类的孩子？”

“他想要防止我摔下去，先生。”

“你为什么距离悬崖边缘那么近，人类的孩子？”

“我在显摆，先生。”

“这是一个很好的回答，人类的孩子。别再那么做了。而现在，”这时，狮子的脸第一次显得没有那么严峻了，“男孩很安全。我把他吹去了纳尼亚。但因为你刚才的所作所为，你的任务要比他困难一些。”

“请问，是什么任务，先生？”吉尔说。

“正是为了这个任务，我将你和他从你们自己的世界中召唤过来。”

这让吉尔非常困惑。“他肯定是把我错当成别人了。”她想。但是她不敢告诉狮子这件事，不过她感觉，如果她不说出来，后面的事情就会变得一团糟。

“说出你的想法，人类的孩子。”狮子说。

“我在想……我是说……是不是出了什么错？因为，你瞧，没有人召唤我和斯克罗布。是我们两个自己要求来这里的。斯克罗布说我们要呼唤——呼唤某某——名字我不记得了……然后，可能，某某就会让我们进入这个世界。我们就呼唤了，然后我们发现那扇门开了。”

“如果我没有召唤你们，你们是不会呼唤我的。”狮子说。

“那么，你就是某某了，先生？”吉尔说。

“是。现在听听你的任务。在离这里很远的纳尼亚的土地上，住着一位年老的国王，他非常悲伤，因为他没有王子延续他的血脉，在他过世之后继承王位。他之所以没有继承人，是因为很多年以前他唯一的儿子被人偷走了。在纳尼亚没有人知道王子去了哪里，也没有人知道他是否还活着。但其实他还活着。我征召你们来承担这项任务，去寻找这位失踪的王子，直到找到他将他带回他父亲的王庭，如果找不到他，你们要么会死在寻找的路上，要么会回到你们自己的世界去。”

“怎么去找，请问？”吉尔说。

“我会告诉你的，孩子。”狮子说，“以下是我引导你们寻找王子的提示。第一，那个名叫尤斯塔斯的男孩一踏足纳尼亚，就会遇到一个昔日的好朋友。他必须立即去和那个朋友打招呼，如果他这么做了，你们两个就会得到很有益的帮助。第二，你们必须离开纳尼亚，一直向北，直到走到古代巨人的城市遗迹。第三，你们会在那座城市遗迹中发现一块石头，上面刻着文字，你们必须按照上面的文字去做。第四，你们会据此认出那位失踪的王子（如果你们找到他的话）：他是你们旅行中遇到的第一个请求你们以我的名义，以阿斯兰的名义做一件事情的人。”

狮子似乎说完了，吉尔觉得自己应该说点儿什么。于是，她说：“非常感谢，我明白了。”

“孩子，”阿斯兰的声音比以往都温柔，“可能你并没有你自己以为的那么明白。但第一步，是要记住。给我按顺序复述一遍那四条提示。”

吉尔试着背了一遍，不是完全正确。于是，狮子一遍遍地纠正她，并让她一次次地复述，直到她说得完全正确为止。在这个过程中，他非常有耐心，因此，背完之后，吉尔鼓起勇气问了个问题：“请问，我该怎么去纳尼亚？”

“乘着我的呼吸。”狮子说，“我会把你吹到这个世界的西方，就像我吹尤斯塔斯一样。”

“我可以及时追上他告诉他第一条提示吗？但我觉得这没关系。如果他见到了老朋友，肯定会过去和朋友说话的，是不是？”

“你没有时间了。”狮子说，“因此，我要立即把你送去。来吧。走在我前面，到悬崖边上去。”

吉尔很清楚地意识到，如果说没有时间了，那也全是她自己的错。“如果我表现得没有那么蠢，斯克罗布和我就已经一起去了那里了。而他也会像我一样听到所有的提示。”她想。她听从狮子的话。但走回悬崖边的这一路还是很令人心惊胆战的，特别是狮子不是和她走在一起，而是走在她后面——他柔软的爪子没有发出一点儿声音。

然而，离悬崖边还有一段不小的距离时，她身后的声音就说：“站好，我马上就会吹了。但是，首先，要牢记，牢记，牢记那些提示。每天早上醒来，对自己说一遍；每天晚上躺下，对自己说一遍；半夜醒来，对自己说一遍。无论你遇到什么奇怪的事情，都不要忘记那些提示。第二，我给你一个警告。在这座山上，我能清楚地和你交谈，在纳尼亚我不会经常这么做。在这座山上，空气很清新，你的头脑很清醒，但当你落到纳尼亚，空气会变得浑浊。一定要小心，不要让它使你的脑子变糊涂了。你在这里获得的那些提示，在那里遇到时，看上去会跟你想象中的完全不一样。所以，你必须要用心去认识它们，不要只看外表，这一点非常重要。记住那些提示，相信那些提示。其他一切都不重要。现在，夏娃之女，再见了……”

到了这席话结尾的时候狮子的声音变得更轻柔了，现在，那声音已经彻底消失了。吉尔看了看身后。令她吃惊的是，她看到悬崖已经离她至少有一百码远了，而狮子也变成了悬崖边一个金光闪闪的小点。她本来一直咬紧牙关，紧紧握着拳头，准备迎接狮子呼吸带来的猛风，但没想到那呼吸非常轻柔，她在离开地面之时甚至都没有感觉。而现在，在她身下，向下几千尺又几千尺，除了空气别无其他。

她只害怕了一秒钟。一来，下面那个世界离她是那么遥远，似乎和她没有什么关系。二来，飘在狮子呼出的空气上极其舒服。她发现自己可以躺下，可以趴着，可以随心所欲地动来动去，就像在水中一样（如果你的漂浮学得很好的话）。因为她移动的速度和狮子的呼吸一样，所以并没有风，空气也似乎格外的温暖宜人。这和在飞机里的感觉完全不同，因为既没有任何噪音，也没有任何震颤。如果吉尔坐过气球的话，她会觉得这更像是在气球里，只是比乘气球更舒服些。

回头望去时，她才第一次发现她刚刚离开的山到底有多大。她很好奇为什么这么巨大的一座山会没有冰雪覆盖——“不过，我猜，这个世界的一切都是与众不同的。”吉尔想。然后她又向下看，不过她距离地面太远了，根本分辨不出自己是在陆地上方飘移还是在海洋上空浮动，更看不出她在以多快的速度移动。

“天啊！那些提示！”吉尔突然说，“我最好背一遍。”她慌了一两秒，但她发现依然能完全正确地说出来。“那就没什么问题了。”她说，心满意足地长出一口气，背向后靠着空气，仿佛靠着沙发一样。

“呃，我得说，”几个小时后，吉尔自言自语地说，“我刚才睡着了。睡在空中，可真是奇怪啊。真想知道还有没有人这么做过。我猜没有吧。噢，讨厌——斯克罗布可能这么睡过！就在这同一段旅途中，他比我提前一些。让我看看下面是什么样子吧。”

下面看起来像是一片广阔的湛蓝色平原。看不到山，但平原上方有白色的庞然大物在缓缓移动。“那肯定是云了。”她想，“但这些云朵比我们从悬崖上看到的那些大太多了。我猜，云变大了，是因为我离得近了。我肯定是飘得低些了。这太阳真讨厌。”

她的旅程刚开始的时候，太阳是当头照的，而现在，阳光射入了她的眼中。这说明，太阳在她前面，落山了。斯克罗布有一点说得很对，吉尔（我不知道一般的女孩子怎么样）没什么方向感。否则，在太阳开始照射她的眼睛时，她就会知道自己基本上是朝着正西方向而去的。

她凝望着身下的蓝色平原，很快便注意到上面零星地散落着一些颜色浅些亮些的小点。“这是海！”吉尔想，“我相信那些小点是岛屿。”的确如此。如果她知道斯克罗布曾经在一艘船的甲板上眺望过那些岛屿，甚至还登上了其中的一座岛屿，她应该会非常嫉妒，不过她并不知道这些。然后，过了一会儿，她才开始看清楚那蓝色而平静的海面上掀起了微微的褶皱：如果你身处那些褶皱之间，你就会发现这些微微的褶皱是非常大的海浪。而现在，在海天相接的地方出现了一道粗粗的暗黑色的线，那条线以极快的速度变得越来越粗，越来越黑，快得你可以看到它在不断地扩张。这是她正飞速行进的第一个迹象。另外，她知道，那越来越粗的线肯定就是陆地。

突然间，从她左边（现在正吹南风）急速地飘来一大片白云，这时，云和她在同一高度。她还没有意识到自己身在何方，就直接飞进了云的中心，那里又冷又湿，雾气蒙蒙。这令她透不过气来，不过她只在云里待了一小会儿。出来后，阳光照过来，她眨了眨眼睛，发现衣服都湿了。（她穿着运动衫、毛衣、短裤、短袜和一双很厚的鞋子；英国的今天是个泥泞的日子。）她从云里出来的时候飘浮的高度比进去的时候又低了一些，她一出来，就注意到了一些事情，我猜这应该是她一直都期待着的，不过，她还是大为震惊。是声音。直到这一刻之前，她都是在一片彻底的静寂中旅行。而现在，第一次，她听到了海浪声和海鸥的鸣叫声。同时，她还闻到了大海的气息。她可以确定，自己的确是在快速移动。她看到两个海浪撞在一起，啪的一声巨响，一团泡沫从中间升起，但还没等她看清楚，这些泡沫就已经消失在她身后一百码远的地方了。陆地正以飞快的速度向她靠近。她能看到远在内陆的高山，也能看到左边一些离得比较近的山。她能看到海湾和海岬，森林和田地，还有一片片的沙滩。海浪拍岸的声音越来越大，渐渐淹没了海洋上的其他声音。

突然之间，陆地呈现在了她的眼前。她直接面向一条河的入海处。她现在飘得很低了，距离水面只有几英尺。一个海浪的浪峰触到了她的脚趾，溅起一大团泡沫，几乎把她腰部以下都打湿了。现在，她的速度慢了下来。她没有被吹到河面上，而是滑到了左侧的河岸上。这里有太多值得看的东西了，她真的目不暇接：一片平滑的绿草地，一艘色泽明亮耀眼得仿佛巨大宝石的大船，塔楼，城垛，迎风招展的旗帜，人群，漂亮的衣服，铠甲，黄金，宝剑。她还听到了音乐。但这一切都显得杂乱无章。她清楚地意识到的第一件事情是她降落了，正站在河岸附近的一片树丛下面。而在离她只有几英尺的地方站着的正是斯克罗布。

她最先想到的是，他多么邋遢啊，看起来多不起眼啊，其次才想到“我简直湿透了呀”！





第三章　国王远航


斯克罗布之所以显得这么邋遢（吉尔也非常邋遢，如果她能看看自己的话），是因为他们周围的一切都非常华丽。我最好立刻就把这一切描述一下。

吉尔在飞向陆地的过程中，曾经从山峰中的一道缝隙，看到了遥远的内陆，落日的余晖正照在一片平整的草地上。在草地的另一边，耸立着一座有很多塔楼和角楼的城堡，城堡的风向标反射着阳光，闪闪发亮，这是吉尔见过的最美丽的城堡。草地的这边，是一座由白色大理石筑造的码头，码头边停泊着一艘船，这是一艘高高大大的船，漆成金色和深红色，船首楼和船尾楼耸立其上，桅杆顶上飘着一面大旗，甲板上有很多旗帜迎风飞舞，舷墙上挂着一排盾牌，像银子般闪闪发亮。船上搭着一条跳板，跳板下面站着一个非常非常沧桑的老人，他正要上船。老人穿着一件富丽华美的猩红色斗篷，斗篷前面是敞开的，露出了里面的银质锁子甲。他头上戴一个细细的金头箍。胡子几乎垂到了腰部，白得像羊毛一般。他站得笔直，把手放在一个衣着华丽的大臣的肩膀上，那个大臣看起来比老人年轻一些，但是你能够看出来他也非常苍老了，而且身体虚弱，似乎一阵风就能将他吹走，而他的眼睛满含泪水。

国王面前——他在登船之前转过身来和臣民说话——是一把小轮椅，这把轮椅由一只比大猎犬大不了多少的小毛驴拉着。轮椅当中坐着一个肥胖的小矮人。他的穿着和国王一样华丽，但是因为肥胖，以及弓腰驼背地坐在椅垫中间，所以两个人的穿衣效果非常不同：他穿着那衣服，让他看起来就像是用一捆乱糟糟的皮毛、丝绸和天鹅绒堆成的。他和国王一样老，不过精神矍铄，精力饱满，眼睛炯炯有神。他光着头没戴帽子，头顶已经秃了，脑袋很大，在夕阳的照射下，就像是一个巨大的台球一样闪闪发光。

再远一些，站成半圆形的，吉尔立刻就认出来了，那是廷臣们。他们的衣着和铠甲都非常引人注目。从吉尔所站的地方来看，他们就像是一个花坛，而不像是一群人。真正让吉尔眼睛和嘴巴都张到最大的，是那些人。如果他们能被称作“人”的话。因为里面只有大约五分之一是人类。其余的，都是你在我们这个世界里从来都没有见过的物种。半羊怪，树精，半人马，吉尔能叫出这些来，因为她见过这些物种的图画。另外还有矮人。还有很多她认识的动物：熊、獾、鼹鼠、豹、老鼠以及各种鸟儿。但他们又和在英国的土地上有着相同名字的动物截然不同。有些要大很多——比方说老鼠，用两条后腿站着，足有两英尺高。除了大小之外，他们的样子也完全不同。你可以从他们脸上的表情判断出来，他们和我们一样，能说话，能思考。“天啊！”吉尔想，“所以一切都是真的。”但她立刻又有了新疑问，“我很好奇，他们好不好相处？”因为她刚刚注意到，人群的外围有一两个巨人，还有一些物种她根本不知道叫什么。

就在这时，阿斯兰和那些提示闪现在了她的脑海中。在过去半小时里，她把这些都忘得干干净净了。

“斯克罗布！”她抓住他的胳膊，轻声说，“斯克罗布，快！你看到有你认识的人了吗？”

“所以，你又出现了，是吗？”斯克罗布不怎么友好地说（他是有理由这样的），“好啦，安静，行吗？我想先听听。”

“别傻模傻样的了。”吉尔说，“一刻都不能耽搁的。你看到某个老朋友了吗？因为你必须立刻过去跟他说话。”

“你在说什么呀？”斯克罗布说。

“是阿斯兰——狮子——说你必须得这样。”吉尔绝望地说，“我见到他了。”

“噢，你见到了，真的吗？他说了什么？”

“他说，你在纳尼亚见到的第一个人，会是你的一个老朋友，你要立刻过去和他说话。”

“呃，这里没有我过去认识的人。而且，我也不知道这里是不是纳尼亚。”

“我还以为你来过这里呢！”吉尔说。

“好吧，你以为错了。”

“好吧，亏你说得出口！你跟我说过……”

“看在老天的分上，你安静一下，咱们听听他们说什么。”

国王正在跟矮人说话，但是吉尔听不到他说了什么。根据她的观察，矮人没有答话，只是不断地点头或摇头。然后国王提高了声调，对全场的人讲话，但他的声音非常苍老沙哑，吉尔只听明白一丁点儿——特别是那些与她从没有听说过的人和地方有关的讲话内容。

讲完话后，国王俯下身子，亲吻了矮人的两颊，然后站直身，举起右手，仿佛是在祈福，接着就迈着无力的步伐，缓慢地走上跳板，上了船。廷臣们似乎因为他的离开而深受触动。大家纷纷拿出了手绢，抽泣声此起彼伏。跳板撤掉，号角声从船尾响起，船只离开了港口。（船是由一艘划艇拖着的，不过吉尔没看到划艇。）

“现在……”斯克罗布说，不过他没有说下去，因为就在这时，一个白色的庞然大物从空中滑落，落在了他的脚下。吉尔起初有一瞬间觉得那是一只风筝。不过，那是一只白色的猫头鹰，只是个头非常大，站在那里和大个的矮人一样高。

他眨了眨眼睛，像近视眼似的盯着他们看，微微歪了歪脑袋，然后用一种温和的呜呜声说：“嘟——呜，嘟——呜！你们俩是谁啊？”“我叫斯克罗布，这是波尔。”尤斯塔斯说，“能麻烦你告诉我们，我们在哪里吗？”

“在纳尼亚的土地上，在国王的凯尔帕拉维尔城堡。”

“是刚刚上船的那个国王吗？”

“非常正确，非常正确。”猫头鹰悲伤地说着，晃了晃他的大脑袋，“不过你们是谁啊？你们两个身上有些魔法。我看到了你们是怎么来到这里的：你们是飞来的。其他人都在忙着给国王送行，都没有注意到，除了我。我碰巧注意到了你们，你们是飞来的。”

“我们是被阿斯兰送到这里来的。”尤斯塔斯低声说。

“嘟——呜，嘟——呜！”猫头鹰说着，竖起了身上的羽毛，“我真有些受不了啊，现在太早了，夜还不够深。太阳落山前我总是不太舒服。”

“我们是被派来寻找失踪的王子的。”吉尔说，她迫不及待地想要加入对话。

“这是我第一次听说这事儿呢。”尤斯塔斯说，“什么王子？”

“你们最好立刻过去跟摄政王大人说说这事儿。”猫头鹰说，“他就在那边，坐在驴车里的那个，矮人杜鲁普金。”猫头鹰一边转身开始领路，一边自己轻声咕哝，“呜！嘟——呜！真是乱透了！我还没有办法思考清楚啊。现在太早了。”

“国王叫什么名字？”尤斯塔斯说。

“凯斯宾十世。”猫头鹰说。吉尔不知斯克罗布为什么猛地停住了脚步，脸色变得非同寻常。她觉得她从来都没有见过他因为什么事情而这么难受。但她还没有来得及问，他们就已经走到了矮人身边，矮人刚刚拉起驴子的缰绳，准备驾车回城堡。廷臣们都各自散开，三三两两地朝同一个方向而去，就像人们刚刚看完运动会或比赛散场一样。

“嘟——呜！哎嗨！摄政王！”猫头鹰说着，稍微低了一下头，把喙靠近矮人的耳朵。

“嗯？怎么了？”矮人说。

“有两个陌生人，大人。”猫头鹰说。

“守林人(1)！你是什么意思？”矮人说，“我看到的是两个格外邋遢的野小子。他们想要什么？”

“我叫吉尔。”吉尔上前一步。她急于说明他们来这里办理的那件重要的大事。

“女孩的名字叫吉尔。”猫头鹰用最大的声音说。

“什么？”矮人说，“女孩全都被杀死了(2)！我一点儿也不相信！什么女孩？谁杀了她们？”

“只有一个女孩，大人。”猫头鹰说，“她的名字叫吉尔。”

“大声讲，大声讲，”矮人说，“不要站在那里，对着我耳朵边嗡嗡啾啾的！谁被杀了？”

“没人被杀。”猫头鹰呜呜地叫道。

“谁？”

“没人。”

“好吧，好吧。你没必要喊。我没有那么聋。你来这里告诉我没人被杀，是什么意思？为什么应该有人被杀？”

“你最好告诉他我是尤斯塔斯。”斯克罗布说。

“男孩叫尤斯塔斯，大人。”猫头鹰用最大的声音喊道。

“没用的？(3)”矮人恼怒地说，“我敢说他的确没用。你把他带到王庭来是为了什么？嘿？”

“不是没用的。”猫头鹰说，“是尤斯塔斯。”

“他已经习惯了？说真的，我不知道你到底在说什么。我告诉你，闪亮羽毛先生，我还是个年轻的矮人的时候，这个国家里面有会说话的兽和鸟，是真的能说话。他们完全不是你这种嘟嘟囔囔，叽叽咕咕，呢呢哝哝。这种说话方式我一刻都不能容忍。一刻都不行，先生。乌那斯，请拿我的助听筒来……”

一直安安静静地站在矮人的手肘边的小半羊怪递给了他一个银制的助听筒。这东西很像一种叫作蛇筒的乐器，管子盘在矮人的脖子上。在他忙着戴助听筒的时候，猫头鹰闪亮羽毛突然间压低了声音对两个孩子说：“我的脑子现在清楚一些了。千万不要说任何关于失踪的王子的事情。我过会儿会跟你们解释。没有用，没用的，嘟——呜！噢，真是一团乱啊！”

“好了，”矮人说，“如果你有任何合情合理的话要说，闪亮羽毛先生，那你就说吧。先深呼吸，不要说太快。”

在孩子们的帮助下，尽管矮人爆发出一阵咳嗽，闪亮羽毛还是解释清楚了这两个陌生人是由阿斯兰派来，拜访纳尼亚王庭的。矮人的眼中闪现出一种异样的光芒，飞快地扫了他们一眼。

“狮子亲自派来的，是吗？”他说，“而且是从……嗯嗯……从另外的地方——从世界尽头之外，是吗？”

“是的，大人。”尤斯塔斯对着助听筒吼道。

“亚当之子和夏娃之女，是不是？”矮人说。但是实验学校的学生没有听说过亚当和夏娃，所以吉尔和尤斯塔斯无法回答这个问题。不过矮人似乎并不在意。

“好吧，亲爱的，”他说着依次挽起两个孩子的手，微微颔首，“非常欢迎你们的到来。如果善良的国王，我可怜的主人，没有刚刚启航去七群岛，他也会因你们的到来而非常开心的。至少你们可以让他暂时重返青春时光——暂时重返。而现在，正是吃晚饭的时候。明天早上你们可以在全体会议上把你们的事告诉我。闪亮羽毛先生，请确保为我们的这些客人提供最尊贵的住处和服装以及其他需要的东西。另外——闪亮羽毛——借一步说话……”

矮人把嘴贴到了猫头鹰的脑袋边，毫无疑问，他想说悄悄话，但是就像其他耳聋的人一样，他对自己的声音没有太好的判断，两个孩子都听到他说：“确保他们好好洗干净。”

之后，矮人用鞭子轻轻抽了一下他的驴子，出发向城堡而去，驴子的速度介于慢走和小跑之间（它是个非常胖的小家伙），半羊怪、猫头鹰和两个孩子则以相当缓慢的速度步行跟在后面。太阳已经落山，空气渐渐变凉。

他们穿过草地，然后又穿过一片果园，到达了凯尔帕拉维尔城堡的北门，走进敞开的大门，他们看到一个长满青草的庭院。右边的大厅和正前方一大片非常复杂的建筑群的窗户都已经亮着灯了。猫头鹰领着他们走进去，然后叫来一个极其讨人喜欢的人照顾吉尔。这个人比吉尔高不了多少，非常苗条，不过显然已经是个成年人了，姿态娴雅，动若拂柳，头发也如同柳条一样，里面似乎还长着苔藓。

她带着吉尔来到一座塔楼中的一个圆形房间里，房间的地面上嵌着一个小浴缸，壁炉中生着火，木柴散发着甜美的气息，穹顶上垂下一条银链，吊着一盏灯。从朝西的窗户可以看见纳尼亚这个异乡的风景，吉尔看到夕阳的红色余晖依然在远山后面燃烧。此情此景令她非常渴望经历更多的冒险，她十分肯定，现在只不过是开始而已。

她洗完澡，梳了头发，换上了已经给她准备好的衣服——这些衣服不仅穿着舒服，看起来也很漂亮，味道宜人，移动的时候发出的声音还非常好听——吉尔本来想回到窗边，继续看外面令人兴奋的风景，不过这时门外传来了砰的一声。

“请进。”吉尔说。斯克罗布走了进来，他也洗了澡，穿着华丽的纳尼亚服装。不过，他的表情显得并不是很享受这一切。

“噢，你原来在这儿呢。”他没好气地说，坐到了一把椅子里，“我一直在找你。”

“好吧，你找到了。”吉尔说，“我说啊，斯克罗布，这一切太让人兴奋和开心了，简直难以形容，是不是？”此刻，她暂时忘记了关于提示和失踪的王子的事情。

“噢！你这么想的啊，是吗？”斯克罗布说，顿了一下，他又接着说，“我想跟神仙祈祷，我们从来没有来过这里。”

“到底为什么呀？”

“我受不了。”斯克罗布说，“看到凯斯宾国王……成了那样一个颤巍巍的老人。这……这太可怕了。”

“啊，这对你有什么伤害？”

“唉，你不会懂的。我现在想起来了，你不会懂的。我没有告诉你，这个世界和我们那个世界的时间是不一样的。”

“你是什么意思？”

“你在这里停留的时间，不会耗费我们任何的时间。你明白了吗？我是说，无论我们在这里待多久，等我们回到实验学校的时候，我们的时间还在离开的那一刻……”

“那就没有那么好玩了。”

“唉，闭嘴！不要一直打断我。等你回到英国——回到我们的世界——你没有办法判断这里的时间是怎么变化的。我们在家里待一年，在纳尼亚可能已经过去了很多年。佩文西家的人跟我说过这些，不过，我就是个傻瓜，全都给忘了。显然，这里和我上次来的时候相比，已经过去了大约七十年——七十纳尼亚年。你明白了吗？我又回来了，却发现凯斯宾变成了一个非常非常苍老的人。”

“所以，国王就是你的老朋友！”吉尔说。一个恐怖的想法袭上心头。

“我真该想到是他的，”斯克罗布痛苦地说，“他真是个要多好就有多好的朋友。不过，我上一次见他，他只不过比我大几岁而已。而现在，看到一个长着白胡子的老人，再想想我们占领孤独群岛那个清晨时的凯斯宾，或是和海蛇大战时的凯斯宾——唉，太可怕了。这比回到这里发现他死了还要可怕。”

“噢，闭嘴。”吉尔不耐烦地说，“这事情比你想的更糟糕。我们错过了第一个提示。”当然，斯克罗布听不懂这些。然后，吉尔就将自己和阿斯兰的对话、四个提示和寻找失踪的王子的任务告诉了他。

“你明白了吗，”她总结说，“正像阿斯兰所说，你看到了一个老朋友，本来应该立刻过去和他说话，但你没有，事情从一开始就走向了错误的方向。”

“但我怎么会知道呢？”斯克罗布说。

“在我想告诉你时，你要是听听就好了，我们就都会做对了。”吉尔说。

“是啊，如果你没有在悬崖边上跟个傻瓜一样，差点儿把我害死就好了——好吧，我说了害死，我还会再说，反复说，让你能保持头脑清醒——如果不是这样，我们就会一起过来，两个人就都知道该做什么了。”

“我猜他就是你看到的第一个人吧。”吉尔说，“你肯定比我早到这里好几个小时。你肯定你没有先看到别的人吗？”

“我只比你早到大约一分钟。”斯克罗布说，“他吹你的速度肯定比我快。为了弥补损失的时间：你损失的时间。”

“别那么讨厌，斯克罗布。”吉尔说，“嘿，是怎么回事？”

原来是城堡内晚餐的钟声响了，因而，即将转变为大吵一场的谈话，就这样愉快地结束了。这个时候，两个人的胃口都非常好。

晚餐在城堡大厅里举行，他们两个都是第一次见到这么丰盛的晚餐，尽管尤斯塔斯过去来过这个世界，不过那一次他的整个经历都在海上度过，丝毫不了解纳尼亚本土的排场和礼节。旗帜从屋顶悬垂下来，每上一道菜，都会吹号击鼓。晚餐上的汤令人一想到就馋涎欲滴，还有一种叫帕文德的美味的鱼，还有鹿肉、孔雀肉和馅饼，冰激凌、果冻、水果和坚果，以及各种各样的酒和果汁。尤斯塔斯甚至兴高采烈地说这顿饭很“像回事儿”。当所有正式的吃吃喝喝结束，一个盲眼的诗人走上前，开始讲述关于科林王子、阿拉维斯以及一匹名叫布里的马的宏大而古老的传说，这个故事名叫《能言马与男孩》，讲的是在至尊王彼得统治凯尔帕拉维尔城堡的黄金时代，发生在纳尼亚、卡罗门以及两国交接的地方的传奇。（现在我没时间讲这个故事，尽管很值得一听。）

当他们终于拖着疲惫的身体上床，哈欠打得脑袋都快掉了的时候，吉尔说：“我打赌，我们今晚会睡得很好。”这一天过得实在是非常充实。而这也刚好说明，没有人知道他们接下来还会遇到什么事情。

第四章　猫头鹰会议


说来有趣，你越困，准备上床的时间就越长，特别是如果你足够幸运房间里面有一个壁炉的话。吉尔觉得她如果不先在壁炉前坐一会儿，就根本没有办法脱衣服。但坐下去之后，她就再也不想起来了。她已经对自己说了五次“我必须上床睡觉了”，这时传来轻拍窗户的声音，让她吃了一惊。

她站起来，拉开窗帘，一开始只看到一片黑暗。然后，她跳了起来，向后退，因为有个庞然大物冲到窗户上，撞响了玻璃。一个非常不愉快的念头出现在了她的脑中：“这应该是这个国家的大蛾子吧！呃！”但这时，那个东西又回来了，而这一次，她差不多可以肯定她看到了一个鸟喙，是那个鸟喙敲响了窗户。“这是一种巨鸟。”吉尔想，“是一只老鹰吗？”她可不怎么期待一只老鹰过来拜访，不过，她打开窗户，向外望去。伴随着一阵巨大的扑拍翅膀的声音，那个东西落在了窗台上，站在那里，占满了整个窗户，所以，吉尔不得不又向后退了一步，给它腾出地方。来访的是猫头鹰。

“嘘嘘！嘟——呜，嘟——呜！”猫头鹰说，“不要出声。你们两个真的渴望去做你们要做的事情吗？”

“关于失踪的王子，你是说？”吉尔说，“是的，我们渴望。”现在，她想起了狮子的声音和脸孔，在大厅里享受盛宴和听故事的时候，她几乎把那些都忘光了。

“很好。”猫头鹰说，“那没有时间可浪费了。你们必须立刻离开这里。我去唤醒另外那个人。然后我会回来找你。你最好换下那些宫廷服装，穿上一些可以旅行的衣服。我一转眼就会回来。嘟——呜！”吉尔还没来得及回答，他就飞走了。

如果吉尔过去经常冒险的话，她可能会质疑猫头鹰的话，不过她没有这样的经历，一想到午夜出逃，她就兴奋不已，完全没有了睡意。她重新换上了自己的运动衫和短裤，短裤的腰带上有一把多功能小刀，她觉得可能会用得到——然后又带上了一些那个长着柳条似的头发的女孩给她留在房间里的东西。她挑了一件短斗篷，这件斗篷到膝盖长，连着一个兜帽（“要是下雨，正好用得着”，她想），她还拿了几块手帕和一把梳子。然后，她坐下来静静等着。

她又开始困了的时候猫头鹰才回来。

“我们准备好了。”猫头鹰说。

“你最好带路。”吉尔说，“我还不熟悉这些走廊。”

“嘟——呜！”猫头鹰说，“我们不是要穿过城堡，那样行不通。你骑到我身上来，我们飞过去。”

“噢！”吉尔张大嘴巴，一动不动，她不太喜欢这个主意，“对你来说，我会不会太重了点儿？”

“嘟——呜！嘟——呜！别傻了。我已经驮过另一个了。好啦，不过我们得先把灯熄灭。”

灯熄灭之后，透过窗户看到的夜色就显得没有那么黑了——不再是黑漆漆的，而是灰蒙蒙的了。猫头鹰站在窗台上，背朝着房间，举起了翅膀。吉尔不得不爬上他短短的胖身子，把膝盖伸到翅膀下面，紧紧夹住。他的羽毛温暖又柔软，但没有可以抓的地方。“我真好奇斯克罗布喜不喜欢他的骑行经历！”吉尔想。她还在这么想时，他们已经猛地一冲，离开了窗台，那双翅膀掀起了一阵风，吹在她的耳朵边，夜晚的空气凉爽而潮湿，轻拂着她的脸颊。

外面比她预想的要亮很多，尽管是阴天，但一抹水汪汪的银色，表明月亮藏在云层后面。下面的田野看上去是灰蒙蒙的，树木都是黑漆漆的。有一些风——是一种刷刷刷哗哗哗的风，显示大雨将至。

猫头鹰兜了一个圈子，城堡出现在他们的前方。只有很少的几扇窗户还亮着灯。他们从城堡上方飞过，飞向北方，飞过那条河，空气变得越来越冷，吉尔觉得她能够看到下方的水面上猫头鹰白色的倒影。但是很快，他们就飞到了河的北岸，飞到了森林地带的上方。

猫头鹰猛地咬住了一个吉尔都没有看到的东西。

“噢，拜托不要这样！”吉尔说，“不要那样乱动。你差点儿把我甩出去。”

“抱歉。”猫头鹰说，“我只是抓住了一只蝙蝠。从节俭这方面来说，没有比可口美味的小胖蝙蝠更能抗饿的东西了。要不要我给你抓一只？”

“不了，谢谢。”吉尔打着哆嗦说。

现在，猫头鹰飞得低了一些，一个黑色的庞然大物出现在他们前方。吉尔刚好来得及看清楚这是一座塔——她觉得是一座部分倾圮的塔，塔身上爬满常春藤——然后，她就发现自己要俯身躲过一扇窗户的拱顶，猫头鹰带着她穿过了一个爬满常春藤、挂满蜘蛛网的入口，从凉爽的灰色夜幕进入到塔楼顶部内的一个黑漆漆的地方。里面有一股浓重的霉味，打从猫头鹰背上滑下来起，她就意识到（一个人通常总能莫名其妙地意识到）这里很拥挤。她听见黑暗之中，四面八方都传来了“嘟——呜！嘟——呜！”的声音，她意识到这里挤满了猫头鹰。这时，一个非常与众不同的声音响起，她真的长出了一口气，那声音说：“是你吗，波尔？”

“是你吗，斯克罗布？”吉尔说。

“好啦，”闪亮羽毛说，“我想人都到齐了。咱们召开猫头鹰会议吧。”

“嘟——呜，嘟——呜。你说得对，正该这么办。”好几个声音说。

“等一小会儿，”斯克罗布的声音说，“我想先说些事情。”

“说，说，说。”猫头鹰们说。吉尔也说：“快说。”

“我猜，你们所有人——我是说猫头鹰，”斯克罗布说，“我猜你们全都知道国王凯斯宾十世年轻时曾经向世界东方尽头航行的事情。呃，我和他一起进行了那场航行，和他，还有老鼠雷佩契普、德里宁大人以及其他所有人。我知道这听起来难以置信，但是在我们的世界，人长大变老的速度和你们这里不一样。我想说的就是，我是国王的人，如果这场猫头鹰会议是任何反对国王的阴谋，我一点儿都不会参与其中。”

“嘟——呜，嘟——呜，我们也都是国王的猫头鹰。”猫头鹰们说。

“那么，会议是为了什么？”斯克罗布说。

“事情是这样的，”闪亮羽毛说，“如果摄政王矮人杜鲁普金听说你们要去寻找失踪的王子，他是不会让你们去的。他会立刻把你们囚禁起来，严加看管。”

“老天爷啊！”斯克罗布说，“你不会是说杜鲁普金是一个叛国者吧？过去，在海上的时候，我听过很多关于他的事情。凯斯宾——我的意思是说国王——无比信任他。”

“噢，不是的。”一个声音说，“杜鲁普金不是叛国者。不过有三十多个勇士（骑士、半人马、善良的巨人以及各种人），先后出发去寻找失踪的王子，没有一个回来的。最后，国王说，他不能让所有最勇敢的纳尼亚人都因为寻找他的儿子而折损掉。所以，现在任何人都不得去寻找王子。”“但他肯定会让我们去的。”斯克罗布说，“只要他知道我是谁，知道是谁派我来的。”

（“派了我们两个。”吉尔插话说。）

“是的。”闪亮羽毛说，“我觉得，他很可能会同意。但是国王不在，杜鲁普金会严守规定。他忠诚如钢，但他聋得像根柱子似的，脾气又非常暴躁。你根本不能让他明白这也许是该破例的时候。”

“你可能会以为他会听取我们的一些建议，因为我们是猫头鹰，每个人都知道猫头鹰有多聪明。”另外一只猫头鹰说，“但他太老了，他只会说：‘你不过是只小鸟崽。我还记得你是个蛋的时候。别来教育我，先生。多嘴多舌！’”

这只猫头鹰惟妙惟肖地模仿了杜鲁普金的声音，四周响起了一片猫头鹰的笑声。两个孩子开始发现，纳尼亚人对杜鲁普金的感觉，就像学校里面的学生对脾气暴躁的老师的感觉一样，每个人都有点儿怕他，每个人都开他的玩笑，但没有人真的讨厌他。

“国王会离开多久？”斯克罗布问。

“但愿我们能知道！”闪亮羽毛说，“你看，有传言说，阿斯兰在群岛上现身了，在泰拉本西亚，我觉得是那里。国王说他在死前应该努力和阿斯兰再见上一面，征询阿斯兰的建议，在他死后该由谁来继承王位。但我们都很担心，如果他没有在泰拉本西亚见到阿斯兰，他会向东，去七群岛和孤独群岛——然后再向东，向东。他从来都没有说过，但我们都知道他永远都忘不了去往世界尽头的航行。我肯定，在他的内心深处，他希望能再去那里一次。”

“那么，等他回来是没有什么用的，对不对？”吉尔说。

“没有，没有用。”猫头鹰说，“噢，真是一团糟！如果你们两个当时知道这些，立马就去和他谈谈！他会安排好一切——应该会给你们一支军队，让你们带着去搜寻王子。”

吉尔这一回没有说话，她希望斯克罗布足够有风度，别把真相告诉所有的猫头鹰。他的确有那份风度，或者说是差不多有吧。就是说，他只是轻声咕哝了一句：“好吧，这并不是我的错。”然后，大声说道：“好吧。我们只好在没有军队的情况下尽力去实现目标了。但我还想知道一件事情。如果这个你所谓的猫头鹰会议，非常正直，光明正大，没有任何不轨之处，那为什么要搞得这么神秘呢——在夜深人静的时候，在一个废弃的古堡里开会？”

“嘟——呜！嘟——呜！”好多只猫头鹰呼呼叫着，“我们应该在哪里见面？除了夜里，人们还会在什么时候开会？”

“你看，”闪亮羽毛解释说，“纳尼亚的大部分生物都有着非常不符合自然规律的习惯。他们在白天做事，在亮堂堂的大太阳底下，呃，这个时候大家都应该在睡觉才对。然后呢，到了晚上，他们就又瞎又蠢，你没办法让他们说一句话。我们猫头鹰坚持在合乎情理的时间开会的习惯，因此在需要讨论事情的时候，我们就自己开会。”

“我明白了。”斯克罗布说，“好啦，现在，我们继续吧。把关于失踪的王子的事情都告诉我们。”然后一只老猫头鹰，不是闪亮羽毛，给他们讲述了王子的故事。

那是大约十年前，凯斯宾的儿子瑞利安还是一个非常年轻的骑士，五月的一个清晨，他和他的母后在纳尼亚的北方骑行。他们带了很多随从和女士，头上都戴着鲜嫩的树叶编织的花环，身边都带着号角，但他们没有带猎犬，因为他们是在进行五朔节(1)游行，而不是在打猎。那天比较暖和的时候，他们来到了一片风景宜人的林间空地，那儿还有一眼泉水从大地中汩汩冒出，他们在那里下马，欢乐饮宴，十分尽兴。过了一会儿，王后觉得困倦了，他们便在长满绿草的泉水岸边铺开斗篷供她休息，瑞利安王子和其他人走得远了一些，以防他们的谈话声和欢笑声吵到她。然而，过了一会儿，一条巨蟒从茂密的树丛中钻出来，在王后的手上咬了一口。所有人都听到了她的尖叫声，于是都向她奔去，瑞利安是第一个跑到她身边的。他看到那条大蟒蛇从王后身边溜走，便拔剑追了上去。那是一条又大又亮、青绿色的毒蛇，他看得十分清楚，但是它潜入了浓密的树丛，他没有办法追上去。于是，他回到母亲身边，发现人们都在她身边忙个不停。

但一切忙碌都是徒劳的，瑞利安一看到她的脸，就知道这世界上的任何药物都无法救治她了。弥留之际，她似乎想努力告诉他一些什么。但她没有办法说清楚，无论她想说些什么，都没有说明白就死去了。从他们听到她的叫声到她死去，几乎不到十分钟。

他们抬着死去的王后返回凯尔帕拉维尔城堡，瑞利安、国王以及所有的纳尼亚人都沉痛地哀悼着她。她是一位了不起的女士，睿智，慷慨，开朗，是凯斯宾国王从世界的东方的尽头带回来的新娘。人们都说她身上流淌着星星的血脉。王子对于母亲的离世非常悲伤，这倒并不奇怪。之后，他总是骑马去往纳尼亚的北方，寻找那条有毒的巨蟒，希望杀了它为母亲复仇。尽管王子每次漫游回来都疲惫不堪，心烦意乱，但大家对此倒不以为意。然而，在王后离世大约一个月后，有些人说他们看得出王子发生了变化。他的眼神就像那些看到了幻象的人那样呆滞散乱，尽管他整天待在外面，但是他的马匹却并没有长途跋涉的迹象。在那些年老的廷臣中，他最好的朋友就是曾经在他父亲去往世界东方的伟大航行时担任船长的德里宁大人。

一天晚上，德里宁对王子说：“殿下必须及早停止寻找那条巨蟒。对无知的畜生，不比对一个人，谈不上真正的复仇。一切都是徒劳的，你只是在折腾自己而已。”王子回答说：“大人，最近这七天，我几乎已经忘记了那条蟒蛇了。”德里宁问他，如果真是这样，为什么他还总是骑马去北方的森林。“大人，”王子说，“我在那里见到了有史以来最美丽的东西。”“好王子，”德里宁说，“明天请容许我与您同行，这样我也能见见这美丽的东西。”“十分荣幸。”瑞利安说。

于是，第二天一早，他们便上马向北方的森林飞奔，直到王后死去的泉水边才下马。德里宁觉得非常奇怪，王子居然偏偏选择了这个地方徘徊逗留。他们在那里休息，直到正午；午后，德里宁抬起头，看到了他这一生中见过的最美丽的女士，她就站在泉水的北面，一言不发，只是对着王子招手，仿佛是在请他到她身边去。她个子高高的，光彩照人，裹着一件薄薄的青绿色长外套。王子失魂落魄地凝视着她。但突然之间，那个女士消失不见了，德里宁不知道她去了哪里，两个人回到了凯尔帕拉维尔城堡。德里宁深深地觉得，那个光彩照人的绿幽幽的女人非常邪恶。

德里宁犹豫不决，不确定自己是否该把这次旅行报告给国王，但是他极不愿意做一个告密者，于是闭紧了嘴巴。可是事后他反倒宁愿自己说了。第二天，瑞利安王子独自骑马出行。那天晚上，他没有回来，从那时起，在纳尼亚或是邻国的土地上，都再也没有发现过他的踪迹，也没有发现过他的马、他的帽子、他的斗篷或是任何他的其他东西。

然后德里宁怀着满腔的痛苦，去见凯斯宾，说：“国王陛下，请立刻将我当作一个大叛徒处决吧：因为我的沉默，我害了你的儿子。”他把故事告诉给了国王。

凯斯宾拿起一把战斧，冲向德里宁大人，要杀了他，德里宁一动不动地站着，等待着死亡的一击。但凯斯宾刚把斧子举了起来，又突然扔了出去，哭着说：“我已经失去了我的王后和儿子，难道我还要失去我的朋友吗？”他搂着德里宁大人的脖子，拥抱他，两个人相拥而泣，他们的友情一如既往。

这就是瑞利安的故事。故事讲完之后，吉尔说：“我打赌，那条蛇和那个女人其实是一回事。”

“是啊，是啊，我们也这么想。”猫头鹰们呜呜叫着。

“但我们不认为她杀了王子。”闪亮羽毛说，“因为没有尸骨……”

“我们知道她没有。”斯克罗布说，“阿斯兰告诉波尔他依然活在某个地方。”

“而这就更糟糕了。”最年老的猫头鹰说，“这意味着她要利用他，意味着她有一个针对纳尼亚的重大阴谋。很久很久以前，在最开始的时候，有一个白女巫自北方而来，用冰雪禁锢了我们的土地长达百年。我们觉得这个可能是她的同伙。”

“很好，那么，”斯克罗布说，“波尔和我必须去找王子。你们能帮帮我们吗？”

“你们有任何线索吗，你们两个？”闪亮羽毛说。

“有的。”斯克罗布说，“我们知道我们必须去北方，到达一座巨人的城市的遗迹。”

这时响起了一阵“嘟——呜”声，比之前都大，还有鸟儿们挪动脚步、扇动翅膀的声音，然后所有的猫头鹰都同时开始说话。他们都在解释说他们有多么遗憾不能和两个孩子一起去寻找失踪的王子。“你们要白天赶路，而我们想在晚上赶路。”他们说，“不行的，不行的。”还有几只猫头鹰补充说，即便是在这座废弃的塔楼中，现在也没有会议刚开始时那么黑了，因为会议进行了很长时间。实际上，只是提了一句要旅行到巨人的城市遗迹，似乎就令这些鸟儿情绪低落。

不过，闪亮羽毛说：“如果他们要往那个方向走——去往埃汀斯摩尔——我们必须带他们去见一个沼泽怪。只有沼泽怪能给他们很大的帮助。”

“是的，是的，该这么做。”猫头鹰们说。

“那么，来吧，”闪亮羽毛说，“我驮一个孩子。谁来驮另一个？必须今晚去。”

“我来，只飞到沼泽怪那里。”另一只猫头鹰说。

“你准备好了吗？”闪亮羽毛问吉尔。

“我觉得波尔睡着了。”斯克罗布说。

第五章　普登格伦姆


吉尔睡着了。从猫头鹰会议一开始，她就哈欠连天，现在彻底进入了梦乡。她被再次吵醒时，一点儿都不开心　，而且她发现自己躺在一个满是尘埃、一团漆黑的钟楼里的光秃秃的地面上，周围几乎挤满了猫头鹰。当她听说还要骑在猫头鹰的背上，出发去别的地方——显然不是去睡觉——心里更加不开心了。

“噢，好啦，波尔，精神一点儿，”斯克罗布的声音说，“毕竟，这就是冒险啊。”

“我讨厌冒险了。”吉尔没好气地说。

不过，她还是答应爬到闪亮羽毛的背上，当猫头鹰驮着她飞入夜空，冷得出奇的空气令她彻底清醒了过来（只是清醒了一会儿）。月亮已经不见了，天空中也没有星星。她能看到，在她身后很远的地方，唯一一扇还亮着灯的窗户高出地面不少，无疑，那是凯尔帕拉维尔城堡的塔楼的一扇窗户。看到这灯光，她非常渴望能回到那个舒服的卧室里，缩在床上，望着壁炉里的炉火。她把手藏在斗篷下面，把斗篷紧紧拉着裹在身上。她听着黑暗的空中距离不太远的地方传来的两个声音，感觉非常怪诞：那是斯克罗布和他的猫头鹰在聊天。“他听起来一点儿都不累。”吉尔想。她没有想到他过去在这个世界中进行过伟大的冒险，纳尼亚的空气令他重新拥有了和凯斯宾国王一起向东方海洋航行时获得的力量。

吉尔不得不掐自己以保持清醒，她知道如果她在闪亮羽毛的背上打瞌睡的话，很有可能会摔下去。最后，两只猫头鹰结束了飞行，她四肢僵硬地从闪亮羽毛身上爬下来，站到一片平地上。一阵冷冽的风吹来，看起来，他们是在一片没有树的地方。“嘟——呜，嘟——呜！”闪亮羽毛叫道，“醒醒，普登格伦姆。醒醒，是狮子的事情。”

过了很长时间都没有回应。最后，在很远的地方，出现一点隐约的微光，离他们越来越近。随即传来一个声音。

“猫头鹰啊！”那声音说，“什么事？国王死了？有敌人踏足纳尼亚了？发洪水了吗？还是出现了龙？”

光线照到他们身边，他们这才知道原来那是一只大灯笼。吉尔几乎看不清那个举着灯笼的人。他的身体似乎只有腿和胳膊。两只猫头鹰和他说话，解释一切，但吉尔太累了，没有听他们说什么。当她意识到他们在跟她道别时，她努力让自己清醒一些。但是之后，她就记不清了，只记得，不知过了多久，她和斯克罗布弯腰钻进了一道矮矮的门，然后（噢，真是谢天谢地）躺在了一个又软又暖的东西上，一个声音说：“就在这里吧。我们已经尽了最大努力了。你们躺着会觉得又冷又硬，还很潮湿，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。你们很有可能根本睡不着，即便这儿没有雷雨或洪水，或者这棚屋也不会塌下来砸在我们所有人身上，正如我知道的那样。必须要尽力去……”那声音还没说完，吉尔就睡得沉沉的了。

第二天早上，孩子们很晚才醒过来，他们发现自己躺在一个光线暗淡的角落里的两个又干燥又温暖的稻草床上。阳光从一个三角形的开口照射进来。

“我们到底在哪儿啊？”吉尔问。

“在一个沼泽怪的棚屋里。”尤斯塔斯说。

“一个什么？”

“一个沼泽怪，别问我是什么东西，我昨晚没看清。我要起来了，咱们去找找它。”

“一个人穿着衣服睡觉，醒来后的感觉真是糟透了啊！”吉尔说着坐了起来。

“我刚刚还在想起床后不用穿衣服有多好啊。”尤斯塔斯说。

“或者也不用洗漱，我猜。”吉尔轻蔑地说。但斯克罗布已经起来了，打着哈欠，抖擞了一下精神，便爬出小屋。吉尔也跟他一起出去了。

他们发现外面和他们昨天看到的纳尼亚截然不同。他们是在一片广袤的平原上，只是这里被难以计数的水道分隔成了难以计数的小岛。这些小岛都覆盖着不平整的野草，岛边长着芦苇和灯心草，时不时地会出现一片一英亩大小的灯心草地。云集在一起的鸟儿不断落在草中，然后又从草中飞起——其中有鹬、麻鸦和苍鹭。他们还看到，周围有很多小屋零零星星地分布着，就像他们昨晚待的那个那样，不过这些小屋彼此都相隔甚远；因为沼泽怪喜欢独居，喜欢不受干扰。除了南方和西方好几英里外的森林边缘，视野之内就一棵树也没有了。东方是平坦的沼泽，一直延伸到地平线上那低矮的沙丘，你能根据从那个方向吹来的风中的咸味判断出来，大海就在那个方向。北方是低矮的灰色山丘，那里偶尔有几处石头堡垒。其余地方都是平坦的沼泽地。若是在潮湿的夜晚，这个地方会令人感觉非常抑郁。但是在清晨的阳光下，清新的微风吹拂，空气中回荡着鸟鸣，沼泽的孤寂中显示出一种美好、新鲜而清新的感觉。孩子们的情绪高涨了起来。

“真好奇那个什么什么东西去哪里了。”吉尔说。

“沼泽怪。”斯克罗布说，他似乎因为自己知道这个名字而非常骄傲，“我很期待——嘿，那肯定就是他。”这时，他们两个都看到了他，离他们大约五十码远，正背对着他们坐着钓鱼。起初很难注意到他，因为他几乎和沼泽是一样的颜色，而且坐着一动不动。

“我觉得我们最好过去和他说话。”吉尔说。斯克罗布点点头。他们都感到了一丝紧张。

他们渐渐靠近，那个人转过了头，露出一张瘦长的脸，脸颊下陷，嘴巴紧闭，鼻子尖尖的，没有胡子。他头戴一顶仿佛尖塔似的又高又尖的帽子，但帽檐却格外的又宽又平。他的头发，如果那能被称作头发的话，是灰绿色的，垂下来盖住了大大的耳朵，每一绺头发都是扁平的，而不是圆的，看起来就像小小的芦苇一样。他的表情非常严肃，肤色是泥巴的颜色，你立刻就能看出来他对待生活的态度非常认真。

“早上好，客人们。”他说，“尽管我说好，但我的意思不是说天也许会下雨或下雪，或是下雾，或是打雷。我敢说，你们一直没睡着吧。”

“实际上，我们睡着了。”吉尔说，“昨天晚上我们睡得很好。”

“啊，”沼泽怪晃了晃脑袋，“我看得出来你们身处逆境也能尽力做到最好，这很好。你们的教养都很好，的确很好。你们都学会了笑对一切。”

“请问，我们还不知道你的名字呢。”斯克罗布说。

“我叫普登格伦姆。不过你们记不住也没有关系。我可以再告诉你们的。”

两个孩子一边一个坐在他的身旁。他们现在都看到了，他的腿和手臂都非常长，所以，尽管他的躯干并不比矮人的躯干大多少，但如果他站起来，还是会比大多数人高。他的手指就像青蛙的爪子一样，是有蹼的，他在泥水中晃荡着的赤着的脚也是有蹼的。他身上松垮垮地穿着泥土颜色的衣服。

“我要抓点儿鳗鱼，做个炖鳗鱼当作我们的午饭。”普登格伦姆说，“不过如果我一条也抓不到，也一点儿都不奇怪。如果我抓到了，你们也不会像我这样喜欢吃鳗鱼。”

“为什么不喜欢啊？”斯克罗布说。

“唉，尽管我毫不怀疑你们会装得对此毫不在乎的样子，可是你们没有理由喜欢我们这种饮食的。不过，我抓鱼的时候，希望你们两个能试着生火——试试总是没坏处的！木柴在小屋后面，可能是湿的。你们可以在小屋里面生火，然后我们的眼睛就都会被烟呛到。你们也可以在外面生火，然后就会下雨将火打灭。这是我的火绒盒，你们不知道怎么用吧，我猜。”

然而，斯克罗布在上次冒险时学过这种事情。孩子们一起跑回小屋，找到木柴（极其干燥），然后没有费多少事儿就成功地生起了一团火。接着，斯克罗布就坐下来看着火，吉尔则出去，在最近的水道里洗漱了一下——洗得不是特别舒服。然后她看着火，轮到斯克罗布去洗漱。他们两个都觉得清爽了很多，但也都饥肠辘辘。

没多久，沼泽怪回来了。尽管他以为自己抓不到鳗鱼，但实际上他抓了十几条，都已经剥皮清理干净了。他架起一口大锅，添了柴火，然后点燃了烟斗。沼泽怪抽的是一种味道很奇怪很浓烈的烟草（有人说里面混了泥），孩子们注意到普登格伦姆的烟斗中冒出来的烟根本就没有往上飘，而是从烟斗中一缕缕地飘出来，向下沉，贴着地面散开，仿佛迷雾一样。烟非常黑，引得斯克罗布阵阵咳嗽。

“好吧，”普登格伦姆说，“那些鳗鱼要花很长时间才能做好，你们两个在做好之前可能会饿昏。我认识一个小女孩——不过，我还是不要跟你们讲那个故事了。那会让你们沮丧的，这是我绝对不会做的事情。所以，不要想着饥饿，我们可以谈谈我们的计划。”

“是的，咱们谈谈吧。”吉尔说，“你能帮我们寻找瑞利安王子吗？”

沼泽怪使劲咂着烟斗，咂得脸颊都凹下去了，他的脸颊下陷，低到了你根本想象不到的程度。“好吧，我不知道你们称这为帮忙，”他说，“我不知道有谁正好能帮这个忙。因为一年中在这个时节，是冬天很快就要到来的时候，我们不大可能往北走太远。而且，从万物的情形看，这是一个早冬。但你们绝不能因此垂头丧气。相比于要面对的敌人、要翻越跋涉的山河、迷路、没有食物、腿脚酸痛等等，我们多半不大会留意天气。而且如果我们走得不够远，就成不了什么事，那么，如果我们走得足够远，也就没必要急匆匆回来了。”

两个孩子都注意到了他说的是“我们”，而不是“你们”，他们两个都异口同声地说：“你要和我们一起去吗？”

“噢，是啊，我当然去啦。也应该一起去，你们懂的。既然国王又再度起航去往异国，我认为我们再也看不到国王重返纳尼亚了，而且他离开的时候咳嗽得很厉害。然后还有杜鲁普金，他的身体也在迅速垮掉。你们会看到这个夏季大旱之后遇上歉收。如果有什么敌人来攻击我们，我一点儿都不觉得惊奇。记住我的话。”

“我们该怎么上路？”斯克罗布说。

“好吧，”沼泽怪缓缓地说，“其他去寻找瑞利安王子的人，都是从德里宁大人看到那个女人的那眼泉水边开始的。他们大多数人都是从那里向北，不过没有一个人回来，我们也说不好他们有过什么发现。”

“我们得先找到一个巨人的城市遗迹。”吉尔说，“阿斯兰是这么说的。”

“得先找到，是不是？”普登格伦姆回答，“不能只是随便找找，我猜是这样吧？”

“当然，我就是这个意思。”吉尔说，“然后，等我们找到了……”

“是的，等找到了！”普登格伦姆非常郑重地说。

“有什么人知道那座城市在哪里吗？”斯克罗布问。

“我不认识‘什么人’。”普登格伦姆说，“我不会说我没有听说过那座城市遗迹。不过，既然你们不从寻找泉水开始。那你们就必须穿过埃汀斯摩尔。如果真有这么一座城市，那么它一定就在那儿。不过我往那个方向走的距离和大多数人一样，也从来都没有见过任何遗迹，所以，我不能欺骗你们。”

“埃汀斯摩尔在哪儿？”斯克罗布说。

“从这儿向北看，”普登格伦姆用烟斗指着说，“看到那些山和那片悬崖了吗？那里就是埃汀斯摩尔的边缘。但是我们要到那里需要过一条河，施瑞堡河。河上没桥，当然没有啦。”

“不过，我觉得我们可以试试涉水过河。”斯克罗布说。

“嗯，之前有人试过。”沼泽怪承认说。

“也许，我们在埃汀斯摩尔可以遇到人，给我们指路。”吉尔说。

“遇到人，你算说对了。”普登格伦姆说。

“什么人住在那里？”吉尔问。

“我也不太适合说他们那样有什么不对。”普登格伦姆说，“如果你喜欢他们那种生活方式的话。”

“是的。不过他们是什么呢？”吉尔追问，“这个国家有很多很多奇怪的生物。我是说，他们是走兽，是鸟类，还是矮人，或者其他什么？”

沼泽怪吹了一声长长的口哨。“咦！”他说，“你们还不知道？我以为猫头鹰都告诉你们了。他们是巨人。”

吉尔心生怯意。书本里面出现的巨人，她从来都不喜欢，她还在噩梦中梦到过巨人。这时，她看到斯克罗布的脸都变成青的了，心中暗想道：“我敢打赌，他比我还害怕呢。”这让她觉得自己勇敢了一些。

“很久之前，国王跟我讲过，”斯克罗布说，“那是我和他在海上冒险的时候——他说他在战争中大大挫败了那些巨人，而且逼得他们向他朝贡。”

“那的确千真万确。”普登格伦姆说，“他们和我们和平共处。只要我们待在施瑞堡河的这边，他们就不会伤害我们。而到了他们那边，到了荒原上——总有个万一。如果我们不靠近他们，如果他们没人忘乎所以，如果别让他们看见我们，我们就有可能走上一大段路。”

“听着！”斯克罗布突然间发起了脾气，人们在感到恐惧时会很容易发脾气，“我不相信事情有你说的一半那么糟糕，就像你说小屋的床不舒服，木头是湿的一样没什么可怕。我觉得如果希望渺茫成那样，阿斯兰就不会派我们去了。”

他以为沼泽怪会怒气冲冲地回答他，但沼泽怪只是说：“就是要这种精神，斯克罗布。这就是说话的态度，笑对一切。但既然我们要一起经历很多艰难，那我们都需要非常注意控制我们的脾气。不该争吵，你们知道的。无论如何，不要太快开始争吵。我知道那些探险队通常都会那样结束：大业未成，却拔刀相向，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。但是只要我们能控制的时间长点儿……”

“好吧，如果你觉得这事没有希望，”斯克罗布打断了他，“我觉得你最好还是留下来，波尔和我单独出发，行不行，波尔？”

“闭嘴，别像头蠢驴似的，斯克罗布。”吉尔赶忙说道，她很担心沼泽怪把他的话当真。

“别灰心，波尔，”普登格伦姆说，“我会去的，肯定会去，一定会去。我不会错过任何这样的机遇。这对我有好处。他们都说——我是说，其他的沼泽怪都说——我太轻浮了，对生活不够严肃。只要他们说起来，肯定就会说上一千次。‘普登格伦姆，’他们说，‘你总是夸夸其谈，激动亢奋，情绪高涨。你得懂得生活并不只是青蛙肉丁和鳗鱼馅饼。你需要一些东西，能让你自己清醒一下。我们都是为了你好才说这些话的，普登格伦姆。’他们就是这么说的。而这样的一个任务——在冬季要开始的时候往北方旅行，去寻找可能不在那里的王子，途经一座谁也没见过的城市遗迹——就是这样的事情。如果这不能让一个人坚定，我真不知道还有什么事能了。”他搓了搓两只青蛙爪子一样的大手，仿佛要去参加一场聚会，或是表演一幕哑剧。“好的，”他接着说，“咱们去看看那些鳗鱼怎么样了。”

饭菜端上来了，非常美味，两个孩子都吃了两大份。起初，沼泽怪不相信他们真的喜欢吃，不过他们吃了好多，就由不得他不信了。他转而说这些食物可能非常不适合他们吃。“沼泽怪的食物，对人类来说可能是毒药，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。”他说。吃过饭后，他们又喝了茶，用的是锡罐（就像你看到那些在路上干活的人喝东西时用的那种），普登格伦姆从一个方形的黑色瓶子里抿了很多口。他给了孩子们一些，不过他们觉得味道很不好。

那天剩下来的时间，他们都用来为明天一早出发做准备。普登格伦姆是三个人里面最大的，他说自己会带上三条毯子，在里面裹上一大块培根。吉尔要拿着剩下的鳗鱼、一些饼干和火绒盒。斯克罗布要在他和吉尔不穿斗篷的时候负责拿两个人的斗篷。斯克罗布（在凯斯宾的带领下向东方航行时学过射箭）带上了普登格伦姆第二好的弓，而普登格伦姆则拿着自己最好的弓，尽管他说，因为刮风、弓弦潮湿、光线不好、手指寒冷，他们射到东西的概率顶多百分之一。他和斯克罗布都有长剑，斯克罗布的那把是从凯尔帕拉维尔城堡的房间里面拿来的，而吉尔不得不只用她的小刀了。他们本可能因此争吵起来，不过争吵一开始，沼泽怪就搓着手，说：“好啦，你们开始了，我早就想到了。这是冒险时经常有的事儿。”他们两个都因此闭了嘴。

三个人都很早就在小屋里面睡着了。这个晚上孩子们真的没睡好。主要是因为普登格伦姆，他说：“你们最好试着睡上一会儿，你们两个，尽管我觉得今天晚上我们谁都没有办法闭上眼。”刚一说完，他就鼾声大作，接连不断，吉尔最后终于入睡，她整夜都梦见轧路机、瀑布和穿过隧道的特快列车。





第六章　北方的野蛮荒原


第二天早上大约九点钟，就可以看到三个寂寞的身影小心谨慎地踩着沙洲和踏脚石，穿过施瑞堡河。这是一条水声喧嚣的浅浅溪流，即便是吉尔，也只是湿到膝盖以下就到达了北岸。过了河再走五十码，地势开始变高，这里便是荒原的边缘了，到处都非常险峻，还有很多悬崖峭壁。

“我觉得那就是我们的路了！”斯克罗布指着左面朝西的地方，那里有一条溪流沿着一道浅浅的河谷穿过荒原顺流而下。但是沼泽怪摇了摇头。

“巨人们主要居住在那道河谷沿岸。”他说，“你可以说那道河谷就是他们的街道。我们最好一直朝前走，尽管这边有点儿陡。”

他们发现了一个可以往上爬的地方，大约十分钟后，他们爬到了坡顶上，三人都气喘吁吁的。他们回头遥遥望了一眼纳尼亚的谷地，然后又转头面朝北方。广袤而孤寂的荒原伸展着，望不到边际。他们左侧的地面上岩石嶙峋。吉尔觉得那边肯定是巨人河谷的边缘，所以不太想往那个方向看。他们就这样出发了。

这儿的土地松软有弹性，路况良好，走起来非常舒服，整天都有冬季的阳光淡淡地照射着。他们往荒原深处走得越远，孤寂的感觉就越强烈，时不时可以听见田凫的叫声，或是看到一只鹰飞过。上午过半时，他们停下来休息了一会儿，从一条小溪边的小浅坑里取了一些水喝，吉尔感觉她终究还是喜欢冒险的，便跟大家这么说了。

“我们还没有开始冒险呢。”沼泽怪说。

第一次休息之后再继续上路——就像在学校里早上休息过后，或铁路旅行中换车后那样——绝对不会和最初时一样了。当他们再度出发，吉尔注意到河谷岩石嶙峋的边缘离他们越来越近了。而且那些石头比起之前看到的，也不那么平坦了，直上直下的。实际上，那些岩石就像一座座小石塔。那些岩石的形状多有趣啊！

“我相信，”吉尔想，“凡是关于巨人的故事，都可能起源于那些奇怪的石头。如果你在天半黑时沿着这里前行，你很容易就误认为这一堆堆的石头是巨人。看看那一个啊！你几乎可以认为顶上的那一大块是个脑袋。虽然相对身体来说这脑袋有点儿太大了，但对一个丑陋的巨人来说却刚好合适。还有，那边那些灌木——我觉得是石南花和鸟巢，真的——但很适合想象成头发和胡子。两边支出来的东西真的很像耳朵。真是大得吓人啊，但是我敢说，巨人就是有大耳朵，像大象一样。还有，哦哦哦！……”

她的血液仿佛结了冰一般，那个东西动了。那就是一个真正的巨人，一点儿没错，她看到他转过了头。她看到了那张硕大而愚蠢的鼓着腮帮子的脸。所有那些东西都是巨人，不是石头。他们共计有四五十个，站成一排，显然是脚踩着河谷的底部，手肘搁在河谷的边缘上，就像人靠着矮墙站的样子——像那些慵懒的人，在一个晴朗的上午吃了早饭后的那副模样。

“继续向前。”普登格伦姆轻声说，他也看到了巨人。“不要看他们。无论做什么，千万不要跑。他们会一下子就追上我们的。”

于是，他们继续向前，假装没有看到巨人。这很像是你经过一座房子的大门，而那里有一条恶犬，只是这比那还要可怕得多。那里有好几十个巨人。他们看上去并没有怒气——不过也不和气——似乎对一切都没有什么兴趣。没有迹象表明他们注意到了这几个旅行者。

这时，嗖——嗖——嗖——有些沉重的东西冲向天空，然后咣啷一声，一颗巨大的卵石落在他们前方二十步的地方。然后——砰——又一颗落在了他们后方二十英尺的地方。

“他们是在瞄着我们扔吗？”斯克罗布问。

“不是。”普登格伦姆说，“如果他们瞄准我们，那我们反而安全多了。他们只是想砸那个——右边那个石堆。他们砸不中，你们知道的。那个石堆非常安全，他们的准头都非常差。他们在大多数晴朗的早晨都会扔石头玩。这大约是他们的智力唯一能理解的游戏了。”

这段时间可怕至极。那一长串的巨人似乎没有尽头，而且一直不停地扔石头，有几块落的位置离他们非常近。除了这真枪实弹的危险，看看他们的脸，听听他们的声音，也足够吓人了。吉尔努力地不去看他们。

大约二十五分钟后，巨人们似乎产生了争执，于是扔石头比赛结束了，但和一群争吵的巨人相隔只有一英里远，也不是什么愉快的事。他们群情激愤，说出一大串毫无意义的词语来彼此嘲笑，每个词都有二十个音节那么长。他们都狂怒地口吐白沫，叽里咕噜说个没完，还上蹿下跳的，每跳一下都好像炸弹爆炸一样，震得大地直颤。他们用巨大笨拙的石头锤子砸彼此的脑袋，不过他们的头颅都太硬了，锤子都被弹了起来，然后发动攻击的那个怪物会因为弹回来的锤子弄疼了他的手指而丢下锤子，痛苦地号叫。但是他太蠢了，过了一分钟，他又会重复完全相同的动作。从长远来看，这倒是好事一件，因为一个小时后，所有的巨人都伤势严重，坐下来开始痛哭。他们坐下之后，头就比河谷的边缘低了，那样就再也看不到他们了，但是在走出一英里远之后，吉尔依然可以听到他们哀号阵阵，又哭又闹，乱吼乱叫的声音。

那天晚上，他们就在光秃秃的荒原上露宿，普登格伦姆向孩子们展示了如何背靠背睡，以充分利用毯子。（背靠背能互相温暖，还能将两条毯子都盖到身上。）尽管如此，还是非常冷，地面又硬，还坑坑洼洼的。沼泽怪告诉他们，他们只要想想过段时间更深入北方后会比现在冷得多，就会觉得舒服一些了，不过这丝毫无法令他们高兴起来。

他们穿越埃汀斯摩尔荒原的行程持续了很多天，省下了腌肉，食物的主要来源是尤斯塔斯和沼泽怪打到的荒原野禽（当然，不是会说话的鸟）。吉尔非常羡慕尤斯塔斯射箭的能力，这是他与凯斯宾国王航行时学会的。荒原中有数不清的溪流，所以，他们一路上都没有缺水。吉尔发现，书里面讲到人们依靠猎杀到的东西为食时，从来都不会告诉你给死鸟开膛破肚清理内脏是件多么耗时间、臭哄哄、脏兮兮的工作，以及这个过程令你的手指感觉有多么寒冷。不过，最好的事情就是他们几乎没有碰到巨人。有一个巨人看到了他们，不过是放声笑了一阵，就咚咚地走开去忙自己的事情了。

大约第十天，他们到达了一片地势开始有了变化的地方。他们来到了荒原的北方边缘，顺着一道长长的陡坡望下去，是一片截然不同的更加阴冷的大地。斜坡底部就是悬崖，悬崖对面，是耸峙的高山，黑黢黢的峭壁，怪石嶙峋的河谷，又深又窄、看不到其中的情形。几条奔涌的大河，从回声隆隆的河谷中喷涌而出，阴沉沉地奔入黑色的深渊。无须说，还是普登格伦姆，指出在更远的斜坡上有点点白雪。

“不过，山坡北面的雪会更多，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。”他说。

他们花了一些时间才到达坡底，然后，他们站在悬崖的顶上，俯视着下方一条从西向东奔流的河。河对岸和他们这边一样，都是峭壁，河面绿幽幽的，丝毫晒不到日光，满是激流和瀑布。河水的咆哮声惊天动地，连他们所站的地方他们都感觉到了震动。

“好的一面是，”普登格伦姆说，“如果我们爬下悬崖时摔断脖子，就不用被河水淹死了。”

“那是什么？”斯克罗布突然指着左边上游的方向说。他们全都看了过去，看到了他们都没有想到的东西——一座桥。而且是多好的一座桥啊！那是一座巨大的单拱桥，横跨河谷，从这边悬崖的顶端通往那边悬崖的顶端，拱顶的位置比两边的悬崖都要高，就如同圣保罗教堂的穹顶比街道高一样。

“天啊，那肯定是一座巨人的桥梁。”吉尔说。

“或者是一座巫师桥，这更有可能。”普登格伦姆说，“我们在这样的地方一定要小心，留神有没有魔法。我觉得这是个陷阱。我觉得我们走到一半，桥就会变成迷雾，融化不见。”

“唉，老天在上，别这么扫兴，”斯克罗布说，“它怎么就不能是一座真真正正的桥呢？”

“你觉得我们见到的巨人里有哪一个够聪明，能建造出这样的东西？”普登格伦姆说。

“但这就不可能是其他巨人建造的吗？”吉尔说，“我是说，那些生活在几百年前的巨人，那些巨人比现在的这种要聪明很多很多。可能和我们寻找的巨人城市的建造者是同一伙人。而那也就是说，我们的路线正确——古老的桥通向古老的城市！”

“这个思路真正好，波尔！”斯克罗布说，“肯定是这样的。走吧。”

于是，他们转弯，向那座桥走去。到了桥跟前，他们发现那座桥确实非常牢固。建桥用的石头，每一块都和史前巨石阵那里的石柱一般大，而且曾经有非常优秀的石匠将石头修整得四四方方，只是现在有了一些裂缝和破损。栏杆上显然曾经有非常精美的浮雕，现在还能看到依稀的痕迹：残破巨人的脸孔和身形，还有牛头人身怪、乌贼、蜈蚣和可怕的神灵的形象。普登格伦姆依然对这座桥不放心，不过他愿意和两个孩子一起过去。

通往拱顶的上坡路走起来漫长而艰难。有很多地方的大石头已经掉落了，出现了骇人的缝隙，透过缝隙往下看，你能看到几千英尺下方河水中泛起的泡沫。他们看到一只鹰从他们脚下飞过。往拱顶方向走得越高，就感觉越寒冷，风也越大，吹得他们几乎都站不稳脚跟，似乎把桥都吹得摇晃起来了。

到达拱顶位置后，他们俯视着桥的另一面，能看到很多残留的古老的巨人道路向远方延伸，直入群山的深处。路上的很多铺路石也都不见了，残留下来的石头中间冒出了一大片一大片的青草。而在路上，有两个正常身材的成人正骑马向他们驰来。

“接着走，向他们走。”普登格伦姆说，“你在这样的地方见到的任何人，都不太可能是敌人，不过我们也不能让他们觉得我们害怕。”

他们走下桥，走到草地上时，那两个陌生人已经离他们很近了。其中一人是个骑士，全副铠甲，面罩也是拉下来的。他的盔甲和马都是黑色的，盾牌上没有装饰，长矛上也没有方旗。另一人是个骑白马的女士，那匹马美极了，让人一看到就想过去吻吻它的鼻子，给它一大块糖吃。而那位女士，偏坐在马鞍上，穿着一件飘逸的绿莹莹的长裙，样子更美。

“你们好，旅——行者。”她的声音俨如最甜美的鸟儿在唱歌，旅字微带颤音，透着欢喜，“要走过这片崎岖的荒原，你们当中有人真得算是小朝圣者了。”

“可能是吧，女士。”普登格伦姆神情严峻，满身戒备。

“我们在寻找巨人的城市遗迹。”吉尔说。

“城市遗——迹？”女士说，“你们找的可真是个古怪的地方。如果找到了，你们计划做什么？”

“我们要……”吉尔开口，但被普登格伦姆打断了。

“请原谅，女士。但我们还不认识你和你的朋友——他是个沉默寡言的小伙子，是不是？——而你也还不认识我们。希望你不介意，我们不愿意这么快和陌生人谈论我们的事情。你看很快就要下雨了吧？”

女士笑出了声，这是你能想象到的最圆润最悦耳的笑声。“好吧，孩子们，”她说，“你们有一位聪明而稳重的老向导陪着。他保留他的看法，我觉得没有什么不对，但我想随心所欲地说说我的看法。我经常听人提到巨人的城市废墟，但从来都没有人跟我说过怎么去那里。这条路通向哈方镇和哈方城堡，那里居住着文雅的巨人，他们都温和、文雅、聪明、彬彬有礼，而埃汀斯摩尔的那些都愚蠢、凶残、野蛮、兽性十足。你们在哈方或许可以打听到去城市废墟的方向，也可能打听不到，不过你们肯定能找到很好的住处和热情的主人。你们最好在那里过冬，至少，在那里休整一些日子，放松一下，恢复一下。你们在那里能够享受到热腾腾的热水澡、软软的床和亮堂堂的炉火，还有烘的烤的，甜的辣的，一天供应四顿。”

“哇！”斯克罗布叫道，“真像样啊！真想再在床上睡觉。”

“是啊，还要洗热水澡。”吉尔说，“你觉得他们会让我们留下来吗？你看，我们不认识他们的。”

“只要告诉他们，”女士说，“绿裙女士让你们代为向他们问好，并且给秋季盛宴送来两个白嫩的南方孩子。”

“哦，谢谢你，非常感谢。”吉尔和斯克罗布说。

“但要注意，无论你们哪天到达哈方，可别太晚上门。因为他们中午过后几个钟头内就会关上大门，这是城堡的习俗，只要拉上门闩，就不会给任何人开门，无论他花多大力气来敲门。”

两个孩子眼睛发亮，再次向她道谢，女士向他们挥手道别。沼泽怪摘下自己的尖帽，动作僵硬地鞠了一躬。然后，那位沉默无声的骑士就和女士一起，骑马走上了拱桥的斜坡，马蹄声嗒嗒，十分响亮。

“好啦！”普登格伦姆说，“我真的特别想知道她从哪儿来，到哪儿去。巨人国的荒野中绝不会遇到她这种人，是不是？她图谋不轨，我敢打赌。”

“胡扯！”斯克罗布说，“我觉得她这人好极了。想想热饭和暖和的屋子。我真希望去哈方的路不远。”

“我同意。”吉尔说，“她的裙子真好看，是不是？还有那匹马！”

“不管怎样，”普登格伦姆说，“我希望我们对她的了解能多一些。”

“我原本打算问问她自己的事的。”吉尔说，“但你不肯告诉她我们的事，我该怎么问呢？”

“是啊。”斯克罗布说，“你为什么要这么严肃，这么郁郁不乐呢？你不喜欢他们吗？”

“他们？”沼泽怪说，“什么他们？我只看到了一个人。”

“你没有看到那个骑士吗？”吉尔问。

“我看到了一套铠甲。”普登格伦姆说，“他为什么不说话呢？”

“我觉得他是害羞。”吉尔说，“或者可能他只想看着她，听她悦耳的声音。如果我是他，我肯定是这样。”

“我真想知道，”普登格伦姆说，“如果掀开头盔的面罩往里看，到底能看到什么。”

“该死的！”斯克罗布说，“想想那铠甲的样式！里面除了是个人，还能是什么？”

“说不准是一具骷髅呢。”沼泽怪的话里透着一股阴森的愉悦。“或者，可能，”他又补充说，“里面根本什么都没有。我是说，你什么都看不到，一个隐形人。”

“好啦，普登格伦姆，”吉尔打了个哆嗦，说，“你的想法真是太吓人了。你觉得他们怎么样？”

“啊，管他的想法呢！”斯克罗布说，“他总是往最坏的方向想，而且总是想错。咱们想想那些文雅的巨人吧，尽快去哈方吧。我真希望知道去那里的路有多远。”

此刻，普登格伦姆曾经预言的第一场争吵马上就要爆发了：不是之前吉尔和斯克罗布经常发生的斗嘴和互相指责，而是第一次真正的严重分歧。普登格伦姆根本不想让他们去哈方。他说，他不知道巨人理解的文雅是什么样的，而且，阿斯兰的提示中完全没有说和巨人住在一起的事情，无论那些巨人是不是文雅的。

而另一方面，一路上的风雨，在篝火上烤的瘦骨嶙峋的野禽，以及睡在坚硬寒冷的地面上，让孩子们都受够了，他们真是死都想去拜访文雅的巨人。最后，普登格伦姆同意了，但有一个条件。两个孩子必须绝对保证，除非他允许，否则，他们不能告诉文雅的巨人他们来自纳尼亚，也不能说出他们在寻找瑞利安王子。他们向他做出了保证后，他们才继续上路。

在和那位女士聊过天之后，有两个方面变得糟糕了。首先，这里变得更难走了。那条路似乎长得没有尽头，窄窄的山谷中总有凛冽的北风吹来，一直吹着他们的脸。没有能用来生火的东西，没有暖和的小浅坑来宿营，这里不再是荒原了。地上全都是石头，白天走在上面，双脚酸疼；晚上睡在上面，浑身都酸疼。

其次，无论那位女士是出于什么目的告诉他们关于哈方的事情，对孩子们产生的实际影响都是不好的。他们一心只想着床铺、热水澡、热饭以及进入室内会有多舒服。现在，他们不再谈起阿斯兰或失踪的王子。吉尔已经放弃了每天晚上和早晨暗自背诵指示的习惯。她先是对自己说，她太累了，然后很快就把提示全都忘掉了。也许你会以为到了哈方能够好好享受的想法，可以让他们振作精神，但实际上却让他们更加自怨自艾，脾气暴躁，彼此找茬，也找普登格伦姆的茬。

最后，在一个下午，他们终于来到了一个地方，这里的河谷豁然开朗，两侧生长着乌黑的杉木。他们向前眺望，发现他们已经穿过了山区。他们面前是一片荒凉的遍布岩石的平地，平地的另一边是覆盖着白雪的远山。而在他们和那些远山之间，有一座矮矮的山丘，山顶虽然参差不齐，地势还比较平坦。

“看啊！看啊！”吉尔指着平地那边叫道，在渐渐聚拢的暮霭之中，在平顶山的另一边，他们都看到了灯光。灯光！不是月光，不是火光，而是一排让人精神一振的点着灯的窗户。如果你从来都没有在蛮荒的野外日以继夜地待上几个星期，就很难理解他们此时的感受。

“哈方！”斯克罗布和吉尔用欣喜激动的声音叫道。“哈方。”普登格伦姆用低沉阴郁的声音重复道。不过他又接着说：“嘿！野鹅！”他说着，迅速摘下了背在肩上的弓。他射了一只肥美的野鹅。今天天色有些晚了，根本不必去想赶到哈方的事了。不过他们有了一餐热腾腾的饭和温暖的营火，这个夜晚一开始比之前一个多星期度过的夜晚都要暖和。然而火熄灭之后，夜里变得寒冷刺骨，第二天他们醒来时，毯子上覆盖着寒霜，已经被冻得硬邦邦的了。

“没关系！”吉尔跺着脚，说，“今晚就能洗上热水澡了！”





第七章　有奇怪沟渠的山丘


无可否认，天气糟透了。头上的天空暗无天日，阴云密布，很快就会下大雪，脚下是黑漆漆的寒霜，冷风吹过，让人觉得皮都要被风吹掉了。他们进入平原后，发现这一段的古道比过去走过的路段毁损得都要严重。他们不得不小心谨慎地迈步，在破裂的大石块、卵石和碎石砾之间选择下脚的地方：他们本来就双脚酸疼，走在这样的路上更加艰难了。然而，尽管累得不行，但实在太冷了，他们根本不能停下来休息。

大约十点钟，第一片小雪花慢慢地飘落下来，落在了吉尔的手臂上。十分钟后，雪就下得非常密了。二十分钟后，大地变成一片耀眼的白色。半小时后，来了一场实实在在的大暴雪，而且看起来会下上一整天，风雪直扑向他们的脸，他们几乎什么都看不到了。

为了理解接下来发生的故事，你必须时刻记住他们能看到的东西多么有限。当他们渐渐走向那座矮山丘时，那座小山把昨天晚上窗户亮着灯的那个地方挡住了，以至于他们几乎一点儿也看不见。只能看到眼前几步远的地方，这真是个大问题，更何况这几步远的地方，还需要你眯缝着眼睛仔细看。不用说，他们都没有说话。

他们到达山丘脚下时，瞥到了两侧可能是石头的东西——如果仔细看的话，能看出来是方方正正的石头，但没有人细看。他们满腹心思都放在了正前方挡住了他们路的一道岩壁上。这道岩壁大约四英尺高。沼泽怪的双腿很长，可以毫不费力地跳到顶上去，然后他再帮助两个孩子上去。对两个孩子来说，爬上去的这个过程弄得他们湿漉漉的，非常讨厌，因为现在岩壁顶上的雪已经非常厚了，不过沼泽怪却没当回事。之后，他们虽然浑身僵硬，但还是开始了爬坡，中间吉尔摔了一跤，他们顺着非常陡峭、非常崎岖的路向上爬了大约一百码远，遇到了第二道岩壁。他们总共遇到了四道岩壁，之间的距离都不相等。

他们费力地爬上第四道岩壁后，已经毋庸置疑，他们到了平顶山的山顶。在此之前，山坡多多少少帮他们挡了些风，而到了这里，他们开始直面猛烈的狂风了。这座山相当奇怪，山顶非常平，和远处看起来的一样。这里是一片高高的台地，暴风雪毫无阻挡地在上面肆虐。在大多数的地方，雪几乎无法积在地上，因为风一直吹着，一层层、一团团的雪被吹离了地面，直拍他们的脸。雪在他们脚边像是旋风一样打着转，就像有时候看到暴风雪刮过冰面那样。实际上，这里有很多地方，地面都平得像冰一样。但雪上加霜的是，地面上纵横交错地分布着奇怪的堤坝或矮坡，将这片山顶分成了大大小小的正方形和长方形。所有这些堤坝当然都需要爬过去，高度从两英尺到五英尺不等，有好几码厚。每一道堤坝的北侧都已经积了厚厚的雪，每爬过一道堤坝，你就会陷进一个雪坑，搞得浑身湿漉漉的。

吉尔头戴兜帽，低着头，顶风冒雪地往前走，斗篷下面的双手都冻麻了，这时她看到这片可怕的台地上还有奇怪的东西——她右边的东西看起来隐约像是工厂的烟囱，她左边有一大块悬崖，直上直下的，比所有的悬崖都要陡。但她对这些毫无兴趣，没把这些放在心上。她此时想的只是她冰冷的双手（还有鼻子、下巴和耳朵），以及到了哈方能享受到的热水澡和温暖的床。

突然之间，她脚下打滑，滑出去大约五英尺远，她发现自己滑入了一个黑暗狭窄的裂缝，不由心惊胆战起来。这道裂缝似乎是突然之间就出现在她面前的一般。半秒钟之后，她滑到了裂缝底部。这里似乎是一个水渠或水沟，只有大约三英尺宽。尽管摔下来的过程吓得她浑身发抖，但她首先注意到的是这里没有风，不由得放松了下来，因为这里的沟壁高出她头顶很多。接下来她注意到的，自然就是斯克罗布和普登格伦姆忧心的脸，他们正从沟边向下望着她。

“你受伤了吗，波尔？”斯克罗布说。

“两条腿都断了，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。”普登格伦姆喊道。

吉尔站起来，解释说自己很好，但他们必须想办法帮她出去。

“你掉进去的是个什么地方呀？”斯克罗布问。

“我觉得是水渠，也可能是地道之类的。”吉尔说，“笔直笔直的。”

“好吧，天啊，”斯克罗布说，“正通向北方！我猜这是不是一条路？如果是的话，我们可以到下面去，躲开这要命的风。下面雪多吗？”

“几乎没有。雪应该都从顶上吹过去了，我猜。”

“还有什么？”

“等一下，我看看。”吉尔说。她站起来，顺着沟渠走，但没走多远，路就拐向了正右方。她喊着把这个信息告诉给了另外两个人。

“拐弯之后呢？”斯克罗布问。

对于这拐来拐去的黑暗地下世界，或者说差不多算是地下世界，吉尔的感觉和斯克罗布对悬崖边缘的感觉是一样的。她不想孤身一人拐过去，特别是她还听到普登格伦姆在她身后大声嘶吼：“要小心啊，波尔。这种地方，可能会通向恶龙的巢穴。而且在巨人国里面，可能会有巨型蚯蚓或是巨型甲虫。”

“我觉得可能哪儿也到不了。”吉尔说着，就赶紧往回走。

“我真该去看一下。”斯克罗布说，“你说的哪儿也到不了是什么意思，我很想搞明白。”于是他坐在沟边（现在他们全都浑身湿透了，根本不在乎再湿一点儿了），滑了下去。他从吉尔身边挤过去，尽管他什么都没有说，但吉尔确信他知道自己害怕了。所以她紧紧地跟在他身后，但又小心地不走到他前面去。

不过，事实证明，这是一次令人失望的探险。他们向右转弯，又直着走了几步，然后就面临了选择，是继续向前，还是拐向正右方。“那边不行。”斯克罗布打量着右边的转弯，说，“拐了我们就回去了——朝南走了。”他选择了直走，不过没走太远，又碰上了第二个向右的转弯，而这一次，没有其他的选择了，因为他们走的那条沟到了尽头。

“不行。”斯克罗布咕哝着。吉尔立刻转身往回走。当他们回到吉尔原本落下来的地方，沼泽怪用他长长的胳膊毫不费力地将他们拉了上去。

不过，重新回到上面非常可怕。在沟渠下面窄窄的缝隙中时，他们的耳朵已经开始解冻了。他们又能看得很清楚，呼吸很轻松，能听到彼此讲话，说话时不需要大声喊。而回到令人瑟缩的严寒中，真是太痛苦了。而且，普登格伦姆还选择了这个时候开口说话：

“你还确切记得那些提示吗，波尔？我们现在应该遵照哪一条？”

“噢，算啦！别理那些提示了。”波尔说，“应该是关于什么人提到了阿斯兰的名字的什么事吧，我觉得。不过，我可一点儿都不想在这里背诵。”

你看，她已经把顺序记乱了。这是因为她不再每天晚上背诵那些提示。如果花心思去想的话，她其实还是知道的，但她对自己要记住的功课已经没有那么熟悉，在被问及时，已经不能不假思索、完全确定无误地按照正确的顺序张口就说了。而且，普登格伦姆的问题让她恼火，因为，在她内心深处，她已经开始对自己恼火了，她对狮子的提示的掌握程度，并不像她自己感觉的那么熟悉。因为这种恼火，再加上又冷又累的痛苦，所以，她说了“别理那些提示了”，不过她并不是真心这么想的。

“噢，那是下一条吧，是不是？”普登格伦姆说，“我真想知道你是不是说对了。都搞混了，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。对我来说，这座山，我们现在所在的这片平地，真的值得停下来仔细看看。你们注意到了吗……”

“天啊！”斯克罗布说，“现在是停下来看风景的时候吗？天神在上，咱们接着走吧。”

“噢，看，看，看！”吉尔大声叫道，她指着一个方向。大家都转头去看，大家也都看到了。再往北一些，比他们所站的台地高出很多的地方，出现了一排灯光。这一次，比他们昨天晚上看到的要更明显，这些就是窗户，小些的窗户让人想到卧室的温馨，大些的窗户令人想到大厅中火焰腾腾的壁炉和桌子上的热汤，或是味美多汁的牛里脊肉冒出的热气。

“哈方！”斯克罗布叫道。

“这很好。”普登格伦姆说，“但我刚才要说的是……”

“噢，闭嘴吧！”吉尔气哄哄地说，“我们不能浪费时间了。你们还记得那位女士说他们很早就锁门吗？我们必须及时赶到那里，必须，必须。这样的晚上，如果我们被关在门外的话，肯定会死的。”

“其实，这并不是晚上，还没到呢。”普登格伦姆开口说，但两个孩子异口同声地说：“走啦！”然后就以他们最快的速度在滑溜溜的台地上费力向前。沼泽怪跟在他们身后，依然说个不停，不过由于他们现在是逆风而行的，两个孩子就算想听他说话，也是听不到的。更何况他们根本不想听。他们都在想着热水澡、床和热饮料，一想到有可能太晚到达哈方被关在门外，就感觉受不了。

尽管他们急匆匆地赶路，但是穿过山丘的平顶还是花了很长的时间。而且，即便是穿过了这一段，山的另一面还有好几道岩壁需要爬下去。不过，他们终于还是到达了山脚，可以看到哈方是什么样子了。

哈方坐落在一处高耸的峭壁上，尽管有很多塔楼，不过这里更像是一座大房子，而不像一座城堡。很显然，文雅的巨人不惧怕外来的攻击。外墙上的窗户开得离地面很近——重要的堡垒都不会出现这样的情况。而且，墙上还有很多奇怪的小门，可以很轻易地不经过庭院就进出城堡。这令吉尔和斯克罗布都精神一振。因为这样的城堡显得非常友好，没有那么可怕。

起初，那处峭壁的高度和陡峭程度令他们生畏，但很快，他们就发现在左边，有一条相对容易上去的路，这条路是条盘山路，曲折地往上。这段上山路也着实骇人，特别是在经历了他们经历过的旅途之后，吉尔差一点儿就要放弃了。斯克罗布和普登格伦姆不得不帮助她走完最后的几百码。不过，到了最后，他们终于站在了城堡大门前。吊闸是升起来的，大门敞开着。

不论你有多么疲惫，要走到巨人家的前门，还是需要一些勇气的。尽管之前普登格伦姆一直都在警告他们，也反对来哈方，但结果看来还是他最勇敢。

“现在，脚步放稳，”他说，“无论做什么，都别表现出害怕来。我们来这里就是做了这个世界上最愚蠢的事情了，但是既然都到了，那我们最好勇敢面对。”

说完这些话，他就大步流星地走到门口，在拱门下面站定，这个位置有回声跟他的声音共鸣，他用他最大的声音叫道：

“哈！看门的！有客人要借宿。”

然后，他就一边等着回应，一边摘下自己的帽子，将宽宽的帽檐上积着的一大堆雪清理下去。

“我觉得吧，”斯克罗布悄声对吉尔说，“他也许很喜欢让人扫兴，不过他真的很有胆子——脸皮也挺厚。”

一扇门打开，显露出一丛诱人的炉火的火光，看门人出现了。吉尔咬着嘴唇，因为她害怕自己会叫出声。这个看门人并不是一个特别高大的巨人，这也就是说，他只比苹果树高一些，不过却没有电线杆那么高。他长着粗硬的红头发，穿着皮背心，上面镶满了金属板，看上去就像是一件锁子甲，膝盖赤裸着（上面长了很多毛），小腿上缠着像是绑腿一样的东西。他弯腰俯身，瞪大了眼睛盯着普登格伦姆。

“你们是什么生物，怎么称呼你们自己？”他说。

吉尔鼓起全身的勇气。“拜托，”她仰头冲着巨人喊道，“绿裙女士向文雅的巨人的国王问好，送我们这两个南方的孩子和这个沼泽怪（他叫普登格伦姆）来加入你们的秋日盛宴。——当然，如果方便的话。”她接着说。

“噢噢！”看门人说，“那就是另外一回事了。进来吧，小人儿，进来吧。你们最好到屋里等着，我去传话给陛下。”他好奇地看了看两个孩子。“青色的脸。”他说，“我真不知道他们是这种颜色的。不过我自己倒不在意。我敢说，你们彼此看起来肯定都觉得挺好看的。甲虫喜欢其他的甲虫，人们都这么说。”

“我们的脸只是被风吹成了青色，”吉尔说，“我们实际上不是这种颜色。”

“进来暖和暖和吧。进来，小虾米们。”看门人说。他们跟着他进了屋。尽管那扇巨大的门在他们身后咣当一下关上的声音听来相当吓人，不过他们立刻把这事情给忘了，因为他们看到了自昨晚晚餐后就一直渴望的东西——一堆火。那是多好的一堆火啊！似乎有四五棵整棵的树在火上燃烧，热烘烘的，他们都没有办法走到距离火堆几码的范围内。不过，他们都瘫坐在砖地上，尽量靠近火堆，如释重负地长长出了一口气。

“好啦，年轻人，”看门人对另一个巨人说，那个巨人一直坐在房间后面，盯着客人，眼睛似乎要从头上跳出来了，“跑去把这个消息报给王庭。”他把吉尔说的话讲给年轻的巨人听，年轻的巨人又望了客人最后一眼，然后一阵狂笑，离开了房间。

“好啦，青蛙仔，”看门人对普登格伦姆说，“你看起来需要点儿东西提提神。”他拿出一个黑色的瓶子，和普登格伦姆自己的瓶子很像，不过要大上二十倍。“让我想想，让我想想，”看门人说，“不能给你用杯子，那样你会淹死的。让我想想。那个小盐瓶正合适。你不需要跟王庭提这个事情，银器今后还会继续弄到这儿来的，而这可不是我的错。”

那个盐瓶和我们用的不一样，要细很多，而且也比较直，巨人将盐瓶放在普登格伦姆旁边的地上，一看就非常适合做他的杯子。

孩子们本以为普登格伦姆要拒绝，像之前那样不信任文雅的巨人。但他只是低声咕哝：“现在我们都进了屋，门也关上了，再考虑谨慎行事已经太晚了。”然后他闻了闻那液体。“闻起来很好。”他说。“但也不好判断，最好确认一下，”说完，他抿了一口。“尝起来也很好。”他说，“但可能就是第一口好喝。接下来如何呢？”他又抿了一大口。“啊哈！”他说，“不过，会全都一样好吗？”他又喝了一口。“底下肯定会有些不对劲儿的，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。”他说完就将酒喝光了，舔了舔嘴唇，然后跟两个孩子说：“你们看，这是个测试。如果我缩成一团，或是身子炸开，或是变成蜥蜴，或是发生什么事，你们就知道，不能吃任何他们给你们的东西。”

巨人离他们很远，没有听到普登格伦姆压低了声音说的话，他大声笑着说：“啊呀，青蛙仔，你是个真男人。都喝光了！”

“不是男人……是沼泽怪。”普登格伦姆用有些含糊的声音回答，“也不是青蛙，是沼泽怪。”

就在这时，他们身后的门开了，年轻的巨人走进来说：“他们需要立刻就去大殿。”

两个孩子站起身，而普登格伦姆则依然坐着说：“沼泽怪，沼泽怪。非常受人尊敬的沼泽怪。受尊敬的怪。”

“给他们带路，年轻人。”看门巨人说，“你最好扛着青蛙仔。他喝得稍微有点儿多了。”

“我没事。”普登格伦姆说，“不是青蛙。半点儿不是青蛙。我是一个受尊敬的怪。”

但年轻的巨人将他拦腰提起，然后示意两个孩子跟上。他们就以这种不体面的方式穿过了庭院。普登格伦姆被巨人牢牢地箍住，腿在空中乱踢，样子真的非常像青蛙。但他们都没来得及注意到这一点，因为他们很快就到了主城堡的大门口——两个孩子的心跳都比平常快了很多——为了跟上巨人的步伐，他们不得不小跑着，啪嗒啪嗒地经过好几道走廊，然后，他们发现自己置身于一个宽敞的房间里，屋内明亮耀眼，灯光璀璨，炉火熊熊，在镀金的屋顶和飞檐的反射下照得人直眨眼。屋内的巨人多得数不清楚，分左右两排站立，全都身着华丽的长袍，房间的另一端有两把宝座，坐在其上的两个庞然大物应该就是国王和王后了。

他们走到距离王座大约二十英尺的地方，停住了脚步。斯克罗布和吉尔笨手笨脚地鞠躬行礼（在实验学校，并不教女孩们怎么行屈膝礼），年轻的巨人轻手轻脚地将普登格伦姆放在地上，他立刻瘫坐在地。说实话，他的四肢那么长，样子真是格外像一只大蜘蛛。





第八章　哈方王庭


“赶紧上，波尔，该你表现了。”斯克罗布压低声音说。

吉尔感觉嘴唇干涩，一个字也说不出来。她拼命地向斯克罗布示意。

斯克罗布心想，他永远都不会原谅她（也不会原谅普登格伦姆），他舔了舔嘴唇，向巨人国王喊道：“陛下，请听我说，绿裙女士让我们向你问好，她还说你会让我们加入你的秋日盛宴。”

巨人国王和王后对视一眼，彼此点了点头，然后微微一笑，吉尔真不喜欢他们笑的模样。相比来说，她更喜欢国王一些。国王长着精致拳曲的胡子，直挺的鹰钩鼻，真的比一般的巨人好看很多。王后胖得要命，双下巴，大胖脸上涂了厚厚的粉——她的脸即便在最好的比例下也不怎么漂亮，更何况还放大了十倍，当然看起来就更糟糕了。然后国王探出舌头，舔了舔嘴唇。虽然任何人都有可能做这样的动作，但是他的舌头又大又红，而且是出人意料地探出来的，真的把吉尔吓了一大跳。

“哦，多好的孩子啊！”王后说。（“可能她才是和气的那个。”吉尔心想。）

“的确是。”国王说，“真是很棒的孩子。我们欢迎你们来到我们的王庭。把你们的手给我。”

他伸出硕大的右手——非常干净，手指上还戴了不知道多少戒指，不过他的指甲都尖尖的，十分吓人。而且他的手也太大了，根本没办法和孩子们伸过来的手相握，于是，他握了握孩子们的胳膊。

“那是什么？”国王指着普登格伦姆问。

“尊金鬼。”普登格伦姆说。

“啊！”王后尖叫道，她收拢裙子，围住脚踝，“好可怕！是活的。”

“他很好的，陛下，真的，他很好。”斯克罗布急忙解释说，“等你们了解了他，就会非常喜欢他的。我肯定你们会的。”

要是我告诉你就在这时吉尔哭了起来，希望你们看到下文不要对吉尔失去兴趣。她之所以哭是有充足理由的。她的双脚、双手、耳朵和鼻子才刚刚开始解冻，融化的雪水滴滴答答地从她衣服上滴落，那天她几乎没有吃过东西，也没有喝过什么，她的双腿酸疼，感觉快站不住了。不管怎么说，在这个时候，她哭起来这个举动，比任何其他举动都要好，因为王后说：“啊，可怜的孩子！陛下，我们让我们的客人一直这么站着，真是不对。快点儿，快来人！带他们走。给他们食物和酒水，让他们洗个热水澡。哄哄那个小姑娘。给她棒棒糖，给她娃娃，给她吃药，想到什么统统给她——牛乳酒、酒心糖、香菜、摇篮曲，还有玩具。别哭了，小姑娘，不然盛宴开始时你就不好了。”

吉尔就如同你我可能有的反应一样，一听到玩具和娃娃，就大为光火，尽管棒棒糖和酒心糖应该挺好的，但她真希望可以得到一些实在的东西。不过，王后的一席蠢话产生了极佳的效果，因为普登格伦姆和斯克罗布立刻就被身形巨大的侍从抱起来，抱起吉尔的是一个身形巨大的女侍从，他们就这样被送去了各自的房间。吉尔的房间有一间教堂那么大，如果壁炉里面没有熊熊燃烧的火，地上没铺着厚厚的猩红色地毯，整个房间就会显得相当阴森。而到了这里，令她愉快的事情开始发生了。她被转交给王后的老保姆，以巨人的角度来看，老保姆是个小个子老妇人，因为上了年纪背驼得很厉害，身体几乎像是对折了一般，而从人类的角度来看，她依然是个女巨人，只是身形较小，进入一个普通房间不会把头撞在屋顶上。她很能干，不过吉尔真希望她不要老是喋喋不休，说些“哦啦啦！起来没事啦”，“这是只鸭子”，“现在我们没事啦，我的小乖乖”之类的话。

她将热水倒入巨人的洗脚盆中，然后帮吉尔爬进去。如果你会游泳的话（吉尔就可以），就会觉得巨人的浴盆是个非常好的东西。而巨人的毛巾呢，虽然有点儿粗糙，也非常好，因为足有几英亩大小。实际上，你根本不需要擦干，只需要在炉火前摊开毛巾，然后在上面滚来滚去滚着玩就可以了。等这一切搞定后，吉尔穿上了干净、清爽又已经被烘暖了的衣服。这些衣服非常漂亮，只是对她来说大了一点儿，但看得出来这些衣服是做给人类的，而不是做给女巨人的。“我猜，如果那个穿着绿裙子的女人常来这里，他们肯定已经习惯了招待我们这种体型的客人了。”吉尔想。

她很快就发现，她猜对了，因为他们给她安排了一套高度刚好合适，普通的成年人类用的桌椅，刀、叉、勺子的大小也正合适。终于可以暖暖和和的，干干净净的，坐下来了，这感觉真是太让人开心了。她的脚还光着，不过踩在巨人的地毯上非常舒服。她踩下去，脚在里面一直能陷到足踝，这正是酸痛的脚所需要的。而那餐饭——我觉得我们该称其为晚餐，尽管现在是接近下午茶的时间——包括韭菜鸡汤、热腾腾的烤火鸡、蒸布丁、烤板栗，还有想吃多少就吃多少的水果。

唯一烦人的事情是保姆一直进进出出的，每次进来，都会拿进来一个巨大的玩具——一个比吉尔还大的大娃娃，一个足有大象那么大的带轮子的木马，一个仿佛小煤气罐一样的鼓，还有一个羊毛制的小羊。这些东西都是粗制滥造的，涂着非常刺眼的颜色，吉尔一看就觉得讨厌。她不断地跟保姆说她不想要，但保姆说：“嘘嘘嘘嘘！等你休息一会儿，你就会想要了，我知道的！嘻嘻嘻！宝宝得睡觉啦。宝贝小乖乖！”

这不是巨人的床，只是一张有四个柱子的大床，和你在老式旅馆中可能会见到的差不多，放在这间大房间里显得格外小。她很开心能摊在床上。

“现在还在下雪吗，保姆？”她困恹恹地问。

“不下了。现在在下雨，宝贝儿！”女巨人说，“雨会把讨厌的雪都冲走。宝贝小乖乖明天就可以出去玩了！”她给吉尔裹好被子，说了声晚安。

我真不知道还有什么事会比被女巨人亲吻更让人不舒服的了。吉尔也是这么想的，不过她没用五分钟就睡着了。

那天傍晚的雨一直不停地下了整整一夜，雨水冲刷着城堡的窗户，不过吉尔完全没听到，她睡得非常沉，睡过了整个晚饭时间，一直睡到后半夜。到了夜里最沉寂的时刻，在这座巨人的房子里面，除了老鼠就没有其他醒着的东西了。在这个时候，吉尔做了一个梦。在她看来，她似乎就在这个房间里醒了过来，看到那堆火，火苗低低的，红红的，借着火光，她看到了那个巨大的木马。那木马似乎有了自己的意识，轮子自己滚动起来，滚过地毯，在她头边停住。现在，它的样子不再是一匹马了，而是一头像马一样大的狮子。而且，不是一个玩具狮子，而是一头真正的狮子。真正的狮子，就像她在世界尽头之外的山上见到的一样。一股混合了所有甜美气息的味道充斥整个房间。吉尔的思绪有点儿混乱，尽管她想不明白是怎么回事，眼泪还是从她脸上滑落，打湿了枕头。狮子让她重复一下那些提示，而她发现自己已经全部忘掉了。想到这里，她感到恐慌至极。阿斯兰将她叼了起来（她能感觉到他的双唇，他的呼吸，但没有感觉到他的牙齿），叼着她到了窗户边，让她透过窗户向外看。月光明亮皎洁，整个大地，也可能是整个天空（她不知道到底是哪儿）上写着大大的字母，拼出来的词语是：在我之下。之后，这个梦就渐渐消失了，第二天早上她很晚才醒来，这时她已经完全不记得自己做过的梦了。

她起床穿好衣服，在炉火边吃了早饭，这时保姆打开门，说：“漂亮小乖乖的小朋友来找她玩啦。”

斯克罗布和沼泽怪进了门。

“嘿！早上好。”吉尔说，“奇不奇怪？我相信我睡了大约有十五个钟头。我感觉好多了，你们呢？”

“我也是。”斯克罗布说，“不过普登格伦姆说他头疼。嘿！——你的窗户有靠窗座。如果我们能够上去，就可以看看外面了。”他们立刻就这样做了，只看了一眼，吉尔就说：“啊，真是糟透了啊！”

外面阳光普照，雪基本上已经彻底被雨水冲没了，只剩下几堆残雪。在他们的下方，像地图一样摊开着的是他们昨天下午跋涉过的平顶山丘的山顶，从城堡中望过去，那分明就是巨人城市的遗迹，不可能被错当成别的。吉尔现在才看出来，那里那么平，是因为那儿铺着砖石，只是有些地方的路面裂开了。而那纵横交错的堤坝，则是这片巨大建筑留下的残垣断壁，那里可能一度是巨人的宫殿或庙宇。有一面墙，大约有五百英尺高，依然矗立在那里，之前她本以为那是一道悬崖。而那些像工厂烟囱的东西，则是巨大的支柱，都已经断裂成了高高低低错落不等的残桩，断裂下来的碎片就在柱子的底座旁边，仿佛是被砍倒的大石头树。而他们从山的北坡爬下的岩壁，是巨人楼梯残留下来的台阶——毫无疑问，他们从南坡爬上的那些岩壁也是如此。而更糟的是，在路的正中，有大大的黑色字母，写着单词：“在我之下。”

三个旅行者沮丧地面面相觑，斯克罗布吹了一声短促的口哨，然后说出了三个人都在想的事情。“第二条和第三条提示被错过了。”就在此时，吉尔的梦又回到了她的脑海。

“是我的错。”她绝望地说，“我——我没有坚持每天晚上背诵那些提示。如果我能时刻想着，应该可以看出来那就是城市的，即便是冒着那么大的雪。”

“我更不行。”普登格伦姆说，“我真看出来了，差不多看出来了。我想过它格外像一座城市遗迹。”

“最不该怪的就是你了。”斯克罗布说，“你试过让我们停下来。”

“不过却不够坚持。”沼泽怪说，“我不该只是试试，我应该做到的。我一手一个，难道拦不住你们俩吗！”

“实际上，”斯克罗布说，“我们都只想着快点儿到这里，全都没有费心思去理会别的事情。至少我知道自己是这样。自从遇到那个女人和那个不说话的骑士，我们就再也没有想过别的。我们几乎都忘了瑞利安王子了。”

“我一点儿都不觉得奇怪，”普登格伦姆说，“这正是她真正的目的。”

“我不明白的是，”吉尔说，“我们怎么会没看到那些字母呢？还是那是昨天晚上才出现的？是不是他——阿斯兰——在夜里留在那里的？我做了一个奇怪的梦。”她将梦都告诉了他们。

“啊呀，你个笨蛋！”斯克罗布说，“我们看到了。我们进到字母里面去了。你不明白吗？我们进入ME后一个字母E里面了。就是你掉下去的那个地道。我们沿着E底下的横走了一段，这段是向北的——右拐到了竖着的那一笔上——然后遇到了第一个右转的路口——这是中间那一横——我们继续走，到了左上角，也就是这个字母的东北角（如果你喜欢用方向表示），然后我们又走了回去。我们可真是大笨球。”他狠狠踢着靠窗座，又接着说，“这样没用，波尔。我知道你在想什么，因为我也在那么想。你在想，如果是阿斯兰在我们经过后才把那些提示留在了城市遗迹的石头上该有多好啊。那样，就是他的错，不是我们的错了。差不多是这样，对不对？不行。我们必须实事求是。我们现在只剩下第四条提示了，前三条都被我们错过了。”

“你是说被我错过了。”吉尔说，“千真万确。自从你把我带到这里，我把一切都搞砸了。不过——我真的感到非常非常抱歉——但不过，那些提示是什么意思？‘在我之下’，听起来说不通啊。”

“说得通的，”普登格伦姆说，“意思是我们要到那座城市的下面去寻找王子。”

“但我们怎么才能去呢？”吉尔问。

“的确是个问题。”普登格伦姆搓着像青蛙爪子一样的大手，“我们现在怎么才能去呢？毫无疑问，如果我们在遗迹里面一直都想着我们的任务，也许就会得知怎么走了——发现一道小门，或是一个山洞，或是一条隧道，然后碰到能帮助我们的人。也许是阿斯兰自己，这可说不好。我们肯定会找到办法去到这些大石头下面。阿斯兰的提示一向管用，毫无例外。但现在该怎么办呢——这就是另一回事了。”

“好吧，我们必须得回去，我估计。”吉尔说。

“很容易，是不是？”普登格伦姆说，“我们也许应该先打开那扇门。”他们全都望向门，没有一个可以够到把手，而且即便他们可以够到把手，也几乎可以肯定没有人能转动把手。

“你们觉得，如果我们自己提出来，他们会让我们出去吗？”吉尔说。没有人说话，不过大家都在想，“假如他们不肯呢。”

这真不是个让人开心的想法。普登格伦姆坚决反对向巨人透露他们真正要做的事情以及直接要求离开的想法，当然，孩子们没有他的许可不会去说，因为他们都承诺过。三个人都非常肯定，在夜里逃出城堡是万万不可能的。他们一进屋，门就会被关上，直到天亮前他们都得像囚犯一样待在里面。当然，他们可以要求让门开着，但那样会引来怀疑。

“我们唯一的机会，”斯克罗布说，“就是趁着天亮偷偷溜出去。中午时候，大多数巨人是不是都要睡上一个小时？——如果我们可以偷偷溜到厨房里去，会不会有一扇后门是开着的？”

“在我看来，这真的很难算作机会。”沼泽怪说，“不过这似乎是我们仅有的机会了。”实际上，斯克罗布的计划并不像你们想象的那么希望渺茫。如果你们想偷偷溜出一座房子，从某些方面来讲，下午过半之时比午夜之时要好。门和窗都极有可能是开着的，如果你被抓住，你总是能假装你并不想走远，并没有什么特别的计划。（而如果在凌晨一点，你从卧室窗户往外爬时被抓住了，就很难让巨人或是大人相信你的话了。）

“不过，我们必须让他们放下戒备。”斯克罗布说，“我们必须假装我们喜欢留在这里，渴望参加那个秋日盛宴。”

“秋日盛宴就在明天晚上。”普登格伦姆说，“我听一个巨人这么说。”

“我明白了。”吉尔说，“我们必须假装对秋日盛宴非常期待非常兴奋，一直跟他们打听。反正他们完全把我们当成了小孩子，这样事情办起来会更容易些。”

“开开心心！”普登格伦姆深深叹了一口气，“我们就这么做。开开心心的，假装我们什么都不在乎，玩玩闹闹。我注意到了，你们两个小家伙的兴致并不总是很高，你们必须看着我，跟着我学。我要开开心心的，就像这样。”说着，他硬挤出了一个超级难看的笑容，“玩玩闹闹。”他凄凄切切地跳了一下。“你们只要盯着我看，很快就能学会的。他们已经觉得我是个好玩的家伙了。我敢说，你们两个昨天晚上肯定认为我喝得有点儿醉了，不过我跟你们保证那是——基本上是——假装的。我知道会有用的，就是知道。”

两个孩子后来谈论起他们的冒险经历时，从来都不敢肯定这最后一句话到底是真是假，不过他们都肯定普登格伦姆在说的时候自己真的认为是那么回事。

“好吧。开开心心，这是关键。”斯克罗布说，“好吧，但愿能有个人来把这扇门打开。我们四处闲逛假装开心的时候，得尽量摸清这座城堡的情况。”

很幸运，就在这个时候，门开了，巨人保姆急匆匆地说：“好啦，我的小乖乖们。想不想出来见见国王和整个王庭去打猎？可壮观啦！”

他们立即从保姆身边冲过去，爬下他们遇到的第一段阶梯。猎犬、号角，还有巨人们说话的声音，都是引路的信号，没一会儿，他们就到了庭院。巨人们全都步行，因为这片地区没有巨马，所以巨人们打猎都是徒步的，和英国人携比格犬步行追猎一样。猎犬们也都是普通体型的。

吉尔没有看到马，起初失望得要命，因为她肯定体型巨大肥胖的王后绝对不会徒步跟在猎犬后面，而让她全天都留在屋子里是万万不可能的。不过，这时，她看到王后坐在一个类似担架的东西上，由六个年轻的巨人抬在肩膀上。这个老蠢货穿了一身绿衣裳，身侧带着一个号角。

这里集合了二三十个巨人，包括国王在内，全都做好了狩猎的准备，一片欢声笑语的喧哗，声音大得可以把你的耳朵震聋，而在他们脚下，和吉尔差不多高的，是一条条摆来摆去的尾巴，汪汪叫着的松垮而又潮乎乎的狗嘴和狗鼻子硬往你手里挤。普登格伦姆正准备摆出他认为是开开心心、玩玩闹闹的姿态来（如果有人看到的话，肯定会把一切都搞砸的），这时吉尔露出了她最具吸引力的孩子气的微笑，冲到王后的担架边，大声对王后叫道：“噢，拜托了！你不是要出去吧，是不是？你会回来的吧？”

“是的，亲爱的。”王后说，“我今晚就回来。”

“啊，真好。太棒了！”吉尔说，“我们明天晚上可以参加盛宴，是不是？我们都特别期待明天晚上呢！我们真喜欢留在这里。你们不在的时候，我们在整个城堡里四处转着看看，可以吗？请一定要答应啊。”

王后真的答应了，不过所有侍从都哈哈大笑，几乎淹没了她说话的声音。





第九章　重要发现


后来，另外两人都承认，吉尔那天的表现棒极了。国王带领狩猎团一出发，她就开始满城堡地参观，问东问西，但始终是以一种天真的孩子气的方式，所以没有人会怀疑她有什么秘密企图。尽管她的舌头一直都没有闲着，但你很难说她是在说话，还是一直在咿咿呀呀叽叽咯咯。她对每个人都示好——马夫、看门人、女佣、女侍从，还有无法去打猎的年老的巨人爵士们。她顺从地接受数不清的女巨人的亲吻和爱抚，她们似乎都很可怜她，都叫她“可怜的小东西”，不过没有人解释这到底是为什么。她和厨师交上了朋友，并发现了至关重要的事情：后厨的洗碗间有一扇门，可以让他们直接穿过外墙，因此他们就不必穿过庭院或是经过门房。在厨房里面，她装作非常贪吃的样子，把厨师和杂工开心地给她的各种食物残渣都吃了。不过到了楼上，和夫人们在一起时，她又开始打听应该穿什么样的衣服出席盛宴，宴会过程中她能待多久，是不是可以和一个个子非常非常矮小的巨人跳舞。这时（后来每当她回忆起来时，都感觉浑身发烫）她歪着脑袋摆出一副白痴相——成年人、巨人和其他人都觉得这个姿势很迷人——晃动着一头鬈发，坐立不安地说：“啊，我真想现在就是明天晚上了，你们呢？你们觉得时间能过得快一些吗？”所有的女巨人都说她真是个完美的小宝贝，有些人用大手帕抹着眼睛，似乎就要哭出来了。

“他们这个年纪的都是些可爱的小东西，”一个女巨人对另一个说，“这似乎很遗憾……”

斯克罗布和普登格伦姆也都尽了全力，然而在这种事情上，女孩就是表现得比男孩好。不过男孩依然表现得比沼泽怪好。

午饭的时候，发生了一些事，让这三个人都更急于离开文雅巨人的城堡。他们在大厅中离壁炉不远的一张专门给他们用的小桌子边用餐。距离他们大约二十码远的地方，有一张大桌子，有五六个老巨人在那边吃午饭。他们的谈话声非常吵，而且又高高在上，两个孩子很快就不注意这些话了，正如你很快就会不注意窗户外面的汽笛声或街道上车马往来的声音。他们吃的是冷鹿肉，吉尔过去从来都没有吃过这种东西，她很喜欢吃。

突然之间，普登格伦姆转头望向他们，他的脸刷的一下变得十分苍白，即便是他的皮肤上蒙了一层天生的泥土色，你依然能看到他苍白的脸色。他说：“一口也别再吃了。”

“怎么了？”两个孩子悄声问。

“你们没听到那些巨人刚才说的话吗？‘这块鹿的腰腿肉真是又美味又软嫩。’其中一个说。‘这么说，那头公鹿真是个骗子。’另一个说。‘为什么这么说呀？’第一个说。‘噢，’另一个说，‘他们说，他被抓住的时候，说：“不要杀我，我的肉很硬，你们不会喜欢的。”’”

吉尔一时没有理解这些话的真正含义。直到斯克罗布惊恐地睁大眼睛，说：“所以我们吃的是一头会说话的公鹿。”

对于这个发现，每个人的感觉不尽相同。吉尔对这个世界还不熟悉，觉得那头公鹿很可怜，认为杀了他的巨人很坏。而斯克罗布曾经来过这个世界，至少有一个会说话的动物是他的好朋友，所以他觉得非常害怕，就像你对谋杀的感觉一样。而普登格伦姆生来就是纳尼亚人，他恶心难受，头晕目眩，就仿佛你发现自己吃了一个婴儿一样。

“我们惹得阿斯兰对我们发怒了，”普登格伦姆说，“这就是我们没有留意到那些提示的结果。我们被诅咒了，我觉得是。如果可以的话，我们能做的最好的事情就是拿起这些刀子，插入我们自己的心脏。”

最后，即便是吉尔也能从普登格伦姆的立场来看待这件事情了。总之，他们没有一个人再吃得下午饭。他们一等到认为比较安全的时候，就轻手轻脚地溜出了大厅。

现在离他们希望能安全逃出去的时间越来越近了，三个人都紧张了起来。他们在走廊中走来走去，等待一切都安静下来。大厅中的巨人们在吃过饭后又坐了极其漫长的一段时间。一个秃头的巨人讲了一个故事。等到他们结束，三个旅行者便悄悄地溜进了厨房。不过那里还有很多巨人，至少在洗碗间里面还有很多巨人忙着擦洗碗碟，收拾东西。等待这些巨人一个接一个地干完各自的活儿，擦干手离开厨房的过程真是让人痛苦难耐。终于，厨房里只剩下一个年老的女巨人了。她东晃晃，西晃晃，最后三个旅行者惊恐地意识到，她根本没打算离开。

“好啦，宝贝们，”她对他们说，“那些活儿都差不多干完了。咱们把水壶放那边，很快就能泡出一杯好喝的茶来。现在我要休息一小会儿。好乖乖们，你们看看洗碗间里面，告诉我后门开着没。”

“是开着的。”斯克罗布说。

“好的。我总是把后门开着，这样小猫就能进出了，那可怜的小东西。”

然后她坐在一把椅子里，把脚架在了另一把椅子上。

“不知道我能不能打个盹，”女巨人说，“但愿喜欢找茬的狩猎队不会回来得太早。”

听到她说“打个盹”，三个人的精神都提了起来，但听到她说狩猎队回来，就又一下落了下去。

“他们通常都什么时候回来？”吉尔问。

“谁也说不准。”女巨人说，“好啦，你们去一边安静一会儿，小宝贝们。”

他们退到厨房的另一头，要不是那个女巨人坐起来，睁开眼睛，挥手赶走了一只苍蝇，他们可能早就溜到洗碗间里去了。“在我们肯定她真的睡着了之前不要轻举妄动。”斯克罗布低声说，“不然会把事情搞砸的。”所以，他们都挤在厨房的那一端，等待着，观察着。去打猎的人随时都有可能回来，一想到这个，他们就觉得可怕极了。而女巨人又一直都睡得不安生。每次他们认为她真的睡着了，她就会动一动。

“我受不了了。”吉尔心想。为了分散注意力，她开始打量四周。她面前正好是一张干净的宽桌子，上面摆着两个干净的馅饼模子，还有一本打开的书。当然，它们是巨大的馅饼模子。吉尔觉得自己都可以舒舒服服地躺到其中的一个里面去。然后，她就爬到了桌边的长椅上，想看看那本书。她读道：

野鸭。这种美味的鸟有多种烹饪方法。

“这是一本厨艺书。”吉尔没有多少兴趣，她扭过头望了望，女巨人的眼睛是闭着的，不过她的样子似乎并没有真的睡着。吉尔又转头继续看书。这本书是按照字母排序的，看到下一个条目时，她的心几乎停止了跳动。这一条是这样的：

人。这种外形优雅的小型两足动物很久以前就被当作美味佳肴，成为秋季盛宴的一道传统菜。在鱼和烤肉之间上桌。每个人……

她读不下去了。她转过身。女巨人又醒了，爆发出一阵咳嗽。吉尔用胳膊肘推了推另外两个人，指着那本书。他们也都爬上长椅，伏在巨大的书页上。斯克罗布还在读着如何烹饪人的那部分，普登格伦姆指向了下面一个条目。那个条目是这样的：

沼泽怪。有些专家不吃这种动物，因为其肉质多筋还带有土腥味，不适合巨人的消化系统。不过土腥味可以极大程度地降低，只要……

吉尔轻轻地碰了碰他的脚，又碰了碰斯克罗布的脚。三个人都转头望向女巨人。她的嘴微微张着，鼻子发出了此刻在他们听来比任何音乐都要动人的声音：她在打鼾。现在的关键就是踮着脚尖走路了，他们不敢走得太快，几乎都不敢喘气，他们穿过洗碗间（巨人的洗碗间味道极其可怕），最终走到了冬季午后苍白暗淡的阳光里。

他们站在一条崎岖的小路的顶上，这是一条下坡路，十分陡峭。而且，谢天谢地，这条路正在城堡的正面，他们能够看到古城遗迹。过了一会儿，他们就走上了从城堡大门向下的宽敞陡峭的大路。而这一边的每一扇窗户，都可以一览无遗地看到他们。如果这面只有一扇窗户，或是两扇，哪怕是五扇，那还有相当的可能性没有人往外看。但这里可不是五扇窗，而是差不多有五十扇。而且，他们现在也发现了，他们正在走的这条路，乃至他们与古城遗迹之间的整片地方，都没有什么能够提供掩护，哪怕是掩护一只小狐狸，这里全是坑坑洼洼的野草、鹅卵石和平坦的石块。而雪上加霜的是，他们现在穿的衣服是昨天晚上巨人给他们的衣服，普登格伦姆除外，因为没有适合他的衣服。吉尔穿的是一件鲜绿色的长袍，对她来说特别特别长，外面披着一件镶了白色皮毛边的猩红色斗篷。斯克罗布穿的是猩红色的长袜、蓝色束腰上衣和蓝色斗篷，配一把金柄的剑，头戴一顶装饰着羽毛的无边帽。

“真是色彩缤纷啊，你们俩。”普登格伦姆咕哝，“在冬天这么穿真是很显眼呢。只要你们在射程内，这个世界上最糟糕的弓箭手也不会失手。说到弓箭手，我们用不了多久就会遗憾没有带上弓，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。你们的那些衣服还有点儿薄，是不是？”

“是，我已经冻坏了。”吉尔说。

几分钟之前，他们还在厨房里的时候，她本来以为只要他们能离开城堡，他们的逃亡就差不多大功告成了。现在她才意识到，最危险的部分还没有开始呢。

“稳住，稳住，”普登格伦姆说，“不要回头看。不要走太快。无论做什么，都不要跑。表现得就像我们只是在闲逛一样，这样的话，如果有人看到我们，他可能，只是可能不会在意我们。如果我们表现得像逃跑的人，就完蛋了。”

和古城遗迹之间的距离似乎比吉尔认为的要长。不过，他们还是在一点点儿地往前走。这时，传来了一阵动静。另外两个人都倒吸了一口凉气。吉尔并不知道那是什么声音，问：“那是什么？”

“狩猎的号角。”斯克罗布轻声说。

“不过现在也不能跑。”普登格伦姆说，“绝对不能跑，除非我发话。”

这一次，吉尔不由自主地扭头望了望。他们左后方半英里远的地方，是归来的狩猎队。

他们继续向前走。突然之间，传来一阵巨大的喧嚣声，紧接着是各种喊叫声。

“他们看见我们了。快跑！”普登格伦姆说。

吉尔拎起长裙——穿着这样的衣服逃跑真是可怕——放开脚步跑了起来。现在真的有危险了。她能听到猎狗的叫声。她能听到国王的吼声：“追上他们，追上他们，要不明天我们就没有人肉馅饼吃了。”

她是三个人当中跑在最后面的，衣服很碍事，她在松动的石头上滑了一下，头发飘进了嘴里，因为奔跑而产生的痛苦直击胸口。猎犬离他们的距离比刚才近了很多。而现在，她必须得跑上山，爬上怪石嶙峋的陡坡，这条陡坡通向巨人台阶最下面的一层。她不知道到了那里之后该怎么办，也不知道就算他们到了顶上，又能好到哪里去。不过她没有想那么多。现在的她就像一只被追猎的动物，只要后面还有人追着，她就必须一直跑，直到倒下为止。

沼泽怪跑在最前面。他刚到最低的台阶边，就停下脚步，向右边望了望，突然之间就钻进了台阶底部的一个小洞中，也可能是一道裂缝。他的长腿一下就缩进去不见了，样子特别像只蜘蛛。斯克罗布迟疑了一下，跟着他躲了进去。吉尔上气不接下气，头昏脑涨，比他们晚了一分钟到那个地方。这个洞看起来真的不会让人产生爬进去的欲望——是一道泥土和石头之间的裂缝，大约三英尺长，几乎不到一英尺高。你必须趴下去，才能爬进去。而且，你也没有办法很快地躲进去。她觉得，她还没有进去，猎狗的牙齿就肯定会咬住她的脚后跟。

“快点儿，快点儿。石头，堵住洞口。”普登格伦姆的声音从她身边的黑暗中传来。下面一片漆黑，只有他们爬进去的洞口处有些灰蒙蒙的光。另外两个人正在卖力干活。她能看到斯克罗布的小手和沼泽怪像青蛙爪子一样的大手，背着光看起来黑漆漆的，正在拼命地堆石头。这时，她才意识到这有多重要，自己也开始摸索大石头，递给另外两个人。在猎狗吠叫着到达洞口前，他们把洞口堵得严严实实的，而现在，当然，洞内一点儿光都没有了。

“再往里走，快。”是普登格伦姆的声音。

“咱们手拉着手吧。”吉尔说。

“好主意。”斯克罗布说。不过他们花了好一会儿工夫才在黑暗中握到彼此的手。此刻，猎狗们正在他们筑起的障碍的另一面嗅来嗅去。

“试试我们能不能站起来。”斯克罗布提议。他们试了试，发现可以站起来。然后，普登格伦姆向后探着手给斯克罗布，斯克罗布向后探着手给吉尔（她真的希望自己是在中间，而不是在最后），他们开始伸出脚探路，在黑暗中跌跌撞撞地向前。脚底下全都是松动的石头。这时，普登格伦姆遇到了一面石壁。他们向右拐了一些，继续向前。一路上非常曲折，还有很多拐弯处。吉尔完全失去了方向感，已经不知道洞口在何方了。

“问题是，”普登格伦姆的声音从前面的黑暗中传来，“综合权衡之下，就算我们可以回去，再回去给巨人们的盛宴添菜也不会有什么好处吧，哪怕我们会在一座山的内部迷路，我敢说，这里十有八九会有龙，有深坑，有毒气，有大水，有——哎哟！松手！顾好你们自己！我……”

这之后的一切瞬息万变。先是传来一声狂叫，然后嗖的一声，紧接着灰尘四起，一阵沙沙的声音，还有石头滚动的声音，然后吉尔发现自己正在下滑，下滑，势不可挡地下滑，下滑的速度越来越快，而身下的斜坡也越来越陡。这并不是一个光滑而牢固的斜坡，而是由碎石和垃圾组成的斜坡。即便你能够站起来，也不会有什么用。无论你站在这个斜坡上的哪一点，这个地方都会滑动起来，并且带着你一起往下。更何况吉尔不是站着的，而是躺着的。他们滑行的距离越远，带动的石头和泥土也就越多，所以，整个下滑的洪流（包括他们自己）也就越来越快，声音越来越大，灰尘越来越多，一切都越来越脏。从其他两个人发出来的尖叫声和咒骂声，吉尔大体听得出来她带动起来的很多石头都重重地砸在了斯克罗布和普登格伦姆身上。她的速度快得像疯了似的，她很肯定自己滑到底部，必然会摔成碎片。

然而，不知怎么回事，他们并没有。他们都有很多瘀伤，脸上有湿漉漉黏糊糊的东西，那应该是血。她身子周围堆了一大圈松动的土、鹅卵石和大石头（有些压在了她身上），她站不起来。周围是一片黑暗，睁着眼睛和闭着眼睛根本不会有什么区别。而且一片静寂。这是吉尔这一生经历的最糟糕的时刻了。她以为她是孤单一人，她以为另外两个都……这时，她听到了身边传来的动静。没多久，三个人就都用颤抖的声音解释说自己似乎没有摔断骨头。

“我们再也上不去了。”斯克罗布的声音说。

“你们注意到这里有多暖和了吗？”普登格伦姆的声音说，“这意味着我们下滑了很长一段路。也许差不多有一英里。”

没有人再说什么。过了一会儿，普登格伦姆又说：“我的火绒盒不见了。”

又是很长一段时间的沉默，然后吉尔说：“我要渴死了。”

没有人提议做什么事情，因为很明显无事可做。那个时候，他们的感觉并不像大家以为的那么糟糕，因为他们都太累了。

过了很久很久，丝毫没有预兆，出现了一个非常奇怪的声音。他们立刻就听出来了，这并不是他们各自心中都最期待的那个声音，这不是阿斯兰的声音。这是一个阴森单调的声音，是一个几乎漆黑一片的声音，要是你能理解的话。这个声音说：“你们怎么到了这里，地上世界的生物？”





第十章　没有太阳的旅行


“谁在那里？”三个旅行者喊道。

“我是地下世界大军的队长，有一百个全副武装的地下人和我一起。”那个声音回答说，“立刻告诉我你们是谁，你们来到深域王国要做什么？”

“我们是意外摔下来的。”普登格伦姆说，非常诚恳。

“很多人摔下来，却很少有人能重返阳光照耀的土地。”那个声音说，“现在准备好跟我去见深域王国的女王。”

“她要我们做什么？”斯克罗布谨慎地问。

“我不知道。”那个声音说，“她的旨意不容置疑，只能遵守。”

他说这些话的时候，传来一种像是轻微爆炸的嗓音，紧接着，一片冷冷的、灰蒙蒙的、隐约透着蓝色的光充满了洞窟。三个人本来都希望那个声音说自己有一百个全副武装的同伴是在毫无根据地吹牛，此刻他们全都死了心。吉尔眨了眨眼睛，然后凝视着那一大伙密密麻麻的人。那群人高高矮矮，从差不多只有一英尺高的小地精，到比一般人高的庄严身影都有，全都手持三叉长矛，肤色白得吓人，一动不动地站着，仿佛雕塑一般。除了这个相同点之外，他们的外貌千差万别，有的有尾巴，有的没有，有的长了大胡子，有的脸孔又圆又光滑，像大南瓜一般。有的长着又长又尖的鼻子，有的长着像小树干一样粗的又长又软的鼻子，还有的长着大大的肉团状的鼻子。有好几个脑袋中间长了独角。不过他们身上又有一点全都非常相似：就是整整一百个人的脸上，都流露出无比的悲伤。他们实在太伤心了，吉尔看了一眼，几乎都忘了害怕。她觉得自己很想给他们打打气。

“好的！”普登格伦姆搓着手说，“这正是我需要的。如果这些家伙教不会我严肃正经地看待生活，我真不知道还有什么可以了。看看那个长着海象胡须的家伙——或是那个……”

“起来！”地下人的头领说。

别无他法，三个旅行者费力地站起身，手拉手。一个人在这种时候就需要摸着一个朋友的手。地下人围拢在他们周围，用又大又软的脚慢慢走着，有的人脚上长了十个脚指头，有的人长了十二个，有的人一个也没长。

“出发。”队长说。然后他们就出发了。

那冷冷的光是从一根长杆子顶上的一个大球发出来的，最高的一个地精举着长杆，走在队列最前面。借助这种死气沉沉的光线，他们看出来他们是在一个天然的洞窟之内，洞壁和洞顶上都疙疙瘩瘩的，扭成一团，或是被一道道裂缝割成千百片奇形怪状的区域，石头地面一路向下倾斜。吉尔的感觉比另外两个同伴要糟糕一些，因为她讨厌黑暗的地下。他们不断前进，洞窟不断向下，也越来越狭窄。终于，举灯的人停住脚步，站到一边，后面的地精一个接一个地弯下腰（最矮的那几个不必弯腰）走入一道黑漆漆的狭小缝隙，消失不见了。这时，吉尔真的受不了了。

“我不能进到那里面去，我不能！我不能！我不去！”她气喘吁吁地说。地下人都一言不发，只是全都把长矛放低，指向了她。

“稳住，波尔，”普登格伦姆说，“如果那道缝后面没变宽些，这些大家伙也不会爬过去的。而且在这个地下世界有一个好处，我们不会淋一点儿雨。”

“唉，你不会明白的。我不能进去。”吉尔哀号。

“想想我在悬崖上的感觉，波尔。”斯克罗布说，“你走前面，普登格伦姆，我跟在她后面。”

“好的。”沼泽怪说着，两手两膝着地，跪在了地上，“你抓着我的脚后跟，波尔，斯克罗布会抓着你的。这样我们就都会很安心的。”

“安心！”吉尔说。但她还是跪下来，用胳膊肘撑着往里爬。这真是一个让人讨厌的地方。你必须趴着，感觉足足需要爬半小时，不过可能实际只有五分钟。那里很热，吉尔感觉就要透不过气来了。不过，前方终于出现了暗淡的光，这条隧道变得越来越宽，越来越高，出去之后，他们又热又脏，浑身颤抖，进入了一个巨大的洞窟，大得根本不像是一个洞窟。

洞里充满一种昏昏沉沉朦朦胧胧的光，所以就不需要地下人那奇怪的灯了。地面上软软的，是一种苔藓，苔藓之中长出了很多奇形怪状的东西，它们像树一样高大并且有很多分枝，又像蘑菇一样松软。它们彼此之间散得很开，不足以连成一片树林，这里更像是一个公园。那种光（一种灰绿色的光）似乎是从这种东西和苔藓上发出来的，但光芒不足以照亮洞顶，洞顶肯定非常非常高。穿过这片温和松软、令人昏昏欲睡的地方，他们被迫往前走。这真让人悲伤，不过这是一种仿佛柔和的音乐一般，带着点儿恬静的悲伤。

他们沿路还看到了几十个奇怪的动物，躺在苔藓地上，到底是死了还是睡着了，吉尔看不出来。这些动物大部分都长得像龙或是蝙蝠，至于是什么物种，普登格伦姆一个都不知道。

“他们是在这里生长的吗？”斯克罗布问队长。队长似乎很惊讶有人会和他说话，不过还是回答了：“不，他们都是通过裂缝或洞窟从地上世界进入深域王国的。很多人下来，却很少有人重返阳光照耀的土地。据说，到了世界终结之时，他们就都会醒过来。”

说完这些话，他的嘴就紧紧闭了起来，仿佛扣上盖子的盒子一般，洞窟内一片沉寂，孩子们感觉他们都不敢再说话了。地精们的赤足踩在厚厚的苔藓上，没有半点儿声音。这里没有风，没有鸟，没有流水的声音。那些奇怪的动物也没有呼吸的声音。

他们走了好几英里，来到一面石墙边，墙上有一个低矮的拱道，通向另一个洞窟。不过，这个通道比上一个入口好多了，吉尔不用低头就能进去。他们进入了一个狭长的小洞窟，大小和形状很像一座大教堂。这里躺着一个正在熟睡的身形极其巨大的人，几乎有整个洞窟那么长。他的身高比所有巨人都高，脸不像是巨人的脸，而是透着高贵和美丽。他雪白的胡须一直盖到腰部，胡须下的胸口轻轻地一起一伏。有一道谁也看不出是从哪里发出的纯净的银光照在他身上。

“那是谁？”普登格伦姆说。已经很长一段时间没有人说话了，吉尔都好奇他是怎么有胆量开口的。

“这是时间老爹，他过去是地上世界的一个国王。”队长说，“现在他掉进了深域王国，躺在这里做梦，梦到他在地上世界所做的一切。很多人下来，很少有人返回阳光照耀的土地。他们说到了世界末日他就会醒过来。”

走出这个洞窟，他们又进入了另一个洞窟，然后一个洞窟接一个洞窟，吉尔都数不清楚了，不过，他们一直都在走下坡路，每一个洞窟都比前一个低一些，现在他们一想起头上泥土的重量和厚度，就不由得透不过气来。最后，他们来到了一个地方，队长命令再度点燃那盏死气沉沉的灯。然后他们又进入了一个洞窟，这里非常宽敞，但一片黑暗，只能看到正前方一条灰白色的沙地直通一片平静的水域。水边有一座小码头，停着一艘船，船上没有桅杆和风帆，但有许多船桨。他们被迫上船，被带到船首，划船手的长凳前面有一块空间，沿舷墙内侧还装有一排座位。

“有一件事情我很想知道，”普登格伦姆说，“以前有没有从我们世界来的人——我的意思是从上面来的——到过这儿？”

“很多人都在苍白的海滩上了船，”队长回答，“却……”

“好啦，我知道，”普登格伦姆打断了他，“很少有人返回阳光照耀的土地。你不需要再说一遍了。你是个死心眼，是不是？”

孩子们一边一个挨着普登格伦姆坐着，在地面上的时候，他们都觉得他是个很爱扫兴的人，但是在这里，他似乎是他们唯一的慰藉了。那盏暗淡的灯被挂在船中间，地下人坐在船桨边，船开始移动了。灯光能照亮的范围很小。他们望向前方，只能看到光滑而黑暗的水面渐渐融入彻底的黑暗。

“唉，我们到底会碰上什么呢？”吉尔绝望地说。

“不要情绪低落，波尔，”沼泽怪说，“有一件事情你要记住。我们已回到了正途。我们现在进入了城市遗迹的下面，我们在它之下了。我们又遵循了提示。”

过了一会儿，他们得到了食物——一种扁扁的松软蛋糕，基本上什么味道都没有。然后，他们渐渐睡着了。等他们醒过来的时候，发现一切都和睡前一样，矮人们还在划桨，船只还在前行，前方还是一片死寂的黑暗。他们醒过来又睡过去，再醒来吃东西又睡过去，这样折腾了多少次，谁也记不清楚了。最糟糕的就是，你开始感觉你似乎一直都生活在这艘船上，生活在那片黑暗中，已经开始想，阳光、蓝天、风和鸟儿是否都只是一个梦。

就在他们几乎放弃希望，也对一切都不再恐惧的时候，他们终于看到前方出现了光，一种阴沉的光，就像他们那盏灯一样。然后，突然之间，那道光靠近了，他们看清他们是超过了另一艘船。之后，他们又遇到了很多艘船。然后，他们就眼巴巴地望着，直到眼睛作痛，终于看到了前方有光照耀在什么东西之上，那仿佛是码头、墙壁、塔，还有移动的人群。但依然没有任何声音。

“天啊！”斯克罗布说，“一座城市！”没多久，他们就都看出来他说的是对的。

但这是一座奇怪的城市。城里的光稀稀落落的，都比不上我们世界中零落分散的小屋的灯光。不过透过那些光你所能看到的那一小块一小块的地方，很像是一片大海港。你能分辨出在一个地方有一大批船只正在装货卸货；在另一个地方，是一大包一大包的货物，还有仓库；在第三个地方，有墙壁和柱子，表明那里是恢弘的宫殿或庙宇。而且无论灯光照在哪里，总能看到没有边际的人群——成百上千的地下人，熙熙攘攘地挤来挤去，他们迈着轻快的脚步，穿过狭窄的街道、宽阔的广场或是爬上一大段台阶，忙着自己的事情。船越来越近，可以听到他们持续不断的活动形成的一种轻柔的低语般的声音，不过其中并没有歌声、喊叫声、钟声和车轮滚动的声音。这座城市非常安静，也非常黑暗，就仿佛是在一座蚁丘的内部。

最后，他们的船只终于被拖到码头边拴牢。三个旅行者被带上岸，向城里进发。一群群地下人，面貌各不相同，在拥挤的街道上和他们擦肩而过，那令人悲伤的灯光照在很多悲伤而怪诞的脸上。不过没有人对陌生人表现出任何兴趣来。每一个地精似乎都在悲伤地忙碌着，只是吉尔一直都没有搞明白他们到底在忙些什么。他们只是没完没了地走来走去，挤挤撞撞，匆匆忙忙，啪嗒啪嗒，轻柔的步履永不停歇。

最后，他们到了一个似乎是一座大城堡的地方，不过城堡里只有很少的几扇窗亮着。他们被带了进去，穿过一个庭院，爬上很多台阶，最后被带到了一个灯光迷蒙的大房间。而在这个房间的一个角落——天啊，真让人高兴——有一道拱门，里面有一种非常与众不同的光，真正的温暖的黄色的光，就像人类使用的一样。这道光照亮了拱门里面的情形，那是一段夹在两面石墙中的楼梯的底部。光应该是从楼梯顶上照下来的。两个地下人一边一个站在拱门处，仿佛哨兵，也可能是侍者。

队长走到这两个人身边，开口说了一句仿佛口令似的话：“很多人掉入地下世界。”

“很少有人返回阳光照耀的土地。”他们两个回答，就像是回复暗语。然后三个人把头凑在一起，交谈了起来。最后，那两个地下侍者中的一个说：“我跟你说，女王陛下出门去处理大事了。我们最好把这些地上居民关在海峡监牢里，直到她归来。很少有人返回阳光照耀的土地。”

就在这时，对话被一个声音打断了，在吉尔听来，那简直是全世界最美妙的声音。声音从上方楼梯的顶上传来，是一个清澈如银铃般的完美的人类声音，是一个年轻男人的声音。

“你们在下面闹腾什么呢，穆鲁古瑟兰？”那声音叫道，“地上人，哈！给我把他们带上来，快！”

“请殿下记住……”穆鲁古瑟兰说，但那个声音打断了他的话。

“要让殿下我高兴，主要是要服从，老话痨。带他们上来。”那个声音说。

穆鲁古瑟兰摇了摇头，示意旅行者们跟着他，迈步走上台阶。每上一级台阶，光就强一分。墙壁上挂着精美的挂毯，灯光透过楼梯顶上薄薄的帘幕，洒下一片金色。地下人撩开帘子，站在一边。三个人走了进去。他们进入了一间漂亮的屋子，屋内挂了很多富丽华美的挂毯，整洁的壁炉中燃烧着明亮的火光，桌上的红酒和雕花玻璃杯也熠熠生辉。一个金色头发的年轻人站起来和他们打招呼。他长得非常帅气，看起来既直率又和气，尽管他脸上有些东西似乎不太对劲。他穿着一身黑色的衣服，很像哈姆雷特(1)。

“欢迎光临，地上人，”他叫道，“不过等一下！请原谅！我见过你们这两个可爱的孩子，还有这个，你们奇怪的监护人。我和我的那位女士一起骑马到埃汀斯摩尔边缘的桥时，见到的就是你们三个，对不对？”

“啊……你是那个一直没有说话的黑骑士？”吉尔叫道。

“那位女士是地下世界的女王吗？”普登格伦姆问，声调不怎么友好。而斯克罗布也在想同样的问题，他脱口而出说：“因为如果她是的话，我觉得她把我们送到想把我们吃掉的巨人的城堡，可真是太卑鄙了。我很想知道，我们到底做过什么伤害她的事情？”

“怎么会？”黑骑士蹙着眉毛说，“如果你不是这么年幼的话，孩子，你和我必须为此争执进行一场生死决斗。我听不得任何诋毁我的那位女士的荣誉的话。但关于此事，你们可以相信，她无论对你们说了什么，都是出于好心。你们不了解她。她拥有所有美德，诚实，慈悲，耐心，温柔，勇气，等等。我知道什么就说什么。单是她对我的善意，对一个没有办法回报她的人的善意，就足以彪炳史册。你们以后会了解她并爱上她的。然而，你们来到深域之境有什么事情吗？”

吉尔坦率直言，普登格伦姆根本来不及阻止她。“我们正在努力寻找纳尼亚的瑞利安王子。”然后，她意识到自己冒了可怕的风险，这些人可能是他们的敌人。但是骑士没有表现出丝毫的兴趣。

“瑞利安？纳尼亚？”他心不在焉地问，“纳尼亚？那是什么地方？我从来都没有听说过这个名字。那肯定距离我所了解的地上世界有一千里格远。不过，你们还真是异想天开，来我的那位女士的国度寻找这个——你们怎么称呼他的？——比利安？垂里安？事实上，据我所知，这里没有这么一个人。”他笑得非常大声，吉尔心中暗想：“我真想知道他的脸到底怎么了，他是不是有点儿傻啊？”

“我们被告知到古城遗迹的石头上寻找一条信息。”斯克罗布说，“然后我们看到了‘在我之下’几个字。”

这时，骑士笑得更猛了。“你们又被骗了。”他说，“这些话和你们的目的没有任何关系。如果当时你们问问我的那位女士，她会给你们更好的建议。因为那些词不过是古时候一条长句遗留下来的部分，她记得十分清楚，那句诗是这样的：

尽管此刻，我身处地下，我的王座不知何处，

然而，在我活着时，所有的大地都在我之下。

由此可以看出，显然是古代巨人中的一个伟大国王被埋在了那里，他的墓碑上刻了这些吹牛的话，然后墓碑碎成了石头，有些被搬走建了新房子，有些和碎石一起填补缝隙，最后只剩下那几个字还能看清。你们居然认为这是写给你们的，这是不是世界上最好笑的笑话？”

这就像一盆冷水一样浇在了斯克罗布和吉尔身上，因为他们觉得，这些词语很可能与他们要寻找的东西毫无关系，他们只是因为意外被带到了这里。

“你们别理会他。”普登格伦姆说，“这不是意外。我们的向导是阿斯兰，巨人国王下令刻下那些字的时候他刚好在，他早就知道会发生的一切，包括此时。”

“你们的向导肯定是个老寿星，朋友。”骑士又笑了起来。

吉尔开始觉得那笑声有点儿让人烦躁。

“对我来说，阁下，”普登格伦姆回答，“你的那位女士肯定也是个老寿星，如果她真记得那些字最初被刻下时的情形。”

“你十分聪明，青蛙脸。”骑士拍了拍普登格伦姆的肩膀，又笑了起来，“你说中了真相。她属于神族，从不知生死和年月。我无比感谢她对我这样一个可怜的凡人的无尽慷慨。你们必须明白，先生们，我是一个承受着最离奇的苦难的人，除了女王陛下，没有人会如此耐心地对我。耐心，我是不是这么说的？不过事情远远不止如此。她许诺让我成为地上世界的伟大国王，等我成为国王，就能牵上她最美的手，共结连理！不过说来话长，不该让你们饿着肚子站着听。嘿，来人，来个人！给我的客人们拿酒来，拿地上居民的食物来！请你们落座，先生们。还有小女士，请坐这把椅子。回头我就把来龙去脉说给你们听。”

第十一章　黑暗城堡中


等到饭（包括鸽子肉馅饼、冷火腿、沙拉和蛋糕）端上来后，大家都拉开椅子坐到桌边吃了起来，而骑士继续讲了起来：

“你们必须要理解，朋友们，我完全不知道自己是谁，什么时候来到这个黑暗世界的。我完全不记得没住到这位几乎无与伦比的女王的王庭之前的事情，但我认为是她从一个邪恶的魔法中拯救了我，并非常慷慨地将我带到了这里。（诚实的青蛙腿，你的杯子空了。让我把它斟满吧。）在我看来，这个可能性很大，因为即便是现在，我依然受到咒语的束缚，只有我的那位女士才能给我解除。每天晚上，都有一个小时，我的意识会经历最可怕的改变，我的身体也会发生变化。一开始，我会变得暴躁易怒，野性十足，如果不将我禁锢起来，我会扑向我最亲爱的朋友把他们杀死。接着很快，我会变成一条巨蟒一样的东西，饥肠辘辘，凶恶残忍，能致人死命。（先生，请再吃一块鸽胸肉，请一定要吃。）他们是这么跟我说的，他们说的肯定是真的，因为我的那位女士也是这么说的。我自己什么都不知道，因为那一个小时过去后，我醒过来时，完全不记得那可怕的恶性发作，我又变回了正常的面貌，有了清晰的意识——只是我会感觉有些疲惫。（小女士，吃块蜂蜜蛋糕吧，这是从世界极南端的一些蛮荒之地专门带来给我的。）现在，女王陛下通过她的法术得知，只要她能让我成为地上世界的国王，头戴王冠，我就能摆脱这个魔法。这个地方已经选好了，还有我们要冲出去的地点。她的地下人一直在日日夜夜地忙碌，在那个地方下面挖了一条路，他们已经挖了很远，到了很高的位置，他们已经挖到离那个国家的地上居民走来走去的草地下方不足二十英尺的地方。很快，那些地上人的命运就会改变。今天晚上，她亲自去了挖掘点，我正等着她的消息，好去和她会合。等到将我和我的王国隔开的那层薄薄的屋顶被洞穿之时，她会领着我，一千个地下人的大军跟在我身后，我会全副武装地骑马向前，突然出现在我们的敌人面前，杀死他们的首领，荡平他们的要塞，肯定不用二十四个小时我就能加冕成为他们的国王。”

“他们运气有点儿背，是不是？”斯克罗布说。

“你真是个令人惊叹、头脑敏捷的小伙子！”　骑士说，“因为，我得凭良心说，我过去从来都没有想到过这一点。我明白你的意思。”一时之间他看上去有一点点儿烦恼的样子，但他的脸色很快就又晴朗起来，他发出了一阵响亮的笑声。“呸，去他的吧！那些人全都忙忙碌碌的，做梦也想不到就在他们平静的土地和地板下面，只有一寻深的地方，有一支强大的军队，时刻准备着就像喷泉一样冲上去攻击他们，想想啊，这是不是世界上最滑稽最荒谬的事情？而且他们还从来都没有怀疑过！啊呀，在最初失败的伤痛过去之后，他们自己再想起来，也只好对这个妙计付之一笑了。”

“我觉得这一点儿都不好笑。”吉尔说，“我觉得你会是个邪恶的暴君。”

“什么？”骑士依然在大笑，他用一种非常惹人恼火的方式拍了拍吉尔的头，“我们的小少女是一个深沉的政治家吗？但是不要害怕，甜心。统治那片土地的时候，我一切都会跟我的那位女士商量，那时她就是我的王后了。她的话就是我的律法，甚至就像我的话将会成为我们征服的子民的律法一样。”

“在我的家乡，”吉尔对他的厌恶每一分钟都在增加，“人们不会重视这么受妻子支使的男人。”

“等你某天有了自己的男人，看法就会不同了，我跟你保证。”骑士说，显然觉得这非常好笑，“不过，我的那位女士是完全不一样的。能听命于她，我感到心满意足，她已经救过我上千次了。母亲会贴心地为孩子承受痛苦，但任何一个母亲都不及女王对我的恩泽。啊呀，你们瞧，她日理万机，百忙之中还经常陪我骑马去地上世界，好让我的眼睛适应阳光。只是那时我必须全身铠甲，放下面罩，不让任何人看到我的脸，也不能对任何人说话。因为她通过魔法发现，那样做会阻碍我摆脱我所承受的邪恶魔法。一位这样的女士，难道不值得一个男人全心全意崇拜吗？”

“听起来她的确是位很好的女士。”普登格伦姆虽然这么说，但语气却表明他的看法恰好相反。

他们还没有吃完晚餐，就已经彻底厌倦了骑士的废话。普登格伦姆心想：“我真的很好奇那个女巫到底打算在这个年轻的傻瓜身上玩什么把戏。”斯克罗布在想：“他是个巨婴，真的是，被绑在了那个女人的围裙带子上了，他真是个笨蛋。”吉尔在想：“他真是很长一段时间以来我见过的最愚蠢、最自大、最自私的猪。”不过，吃完饭后，骑士的情绪发生了变化。他不再笑了。

“朋友们，”他说，“我的那一个小时就快要到了。尽管我很害怕单独一个人，但如果你们看见我那副模样，我会感觉到很羞愧。他们很快就会进来，将我的手脚绑在那边的椅子上。唉，必须这样的，因为他们告诉我，在我发狂的时候，我会把能碰到的一切都摧毁。”

“我说，”斯克罗布说，“对于你中魔法，我真的感到很难过，不过，那些人进来捆你的时候，会对我们做什么？他们之前说要把我们关到监狱里面的。我们非常不喜欢那些黑暗的地方。我们更愿意留在这里直到你……好起来……如果可以的话。”

“这样很周到，”骑士说，“不过根据惯例，在我中了魔法的一小时里，除了女王本人，谁也不能和我在一起。她细心地维护我的荣誉，所以，除了她自己，她不愿意让任何一双耳朵听到我在癫狂中说出的那些话。而我也不可能轻易说服照顾我的地精允许你们留下来陪我。我觉得此时我已经听到了他们上楼的轻柔的脚步声了。你们从那扇门出去，那里通向我的另一个房间。你们可以在那里等到他们将我松绑后我过去找你们，或者，如果你们愿意的话，可以回来坐在这里陪着发疯的我。”

他们按照他的指点，通过一扇他们之前没见打开过的门走出房间。走过这扇门，他们很欣喜地发现，这扇门不是通向黑暗，而是通向一条点了灯的走廊。他们试着打开了好几扇门，发现了（他们正迫切需要的）清洗用的水，甚至找到了一面镜子。“他在晚餐前都没让我们洗洗。”吉尔擦着脸说，“自私自利、以自我为中心的猪。”

“我们要回去看看中了魔法的骑士吗，还是留在这里？”斯克罗布问。

“我主张待在这儿，”吉尔说，“我不愿意看见这种事情。”但她心里还是觉得有点儿好奇。

“不，回去。”普登格伦姆说，“我们可以探得一些消息，我们需要能得到的一切消息。我很肯定，那个女王是个女巫，是敌人。那些地下人一看到我们，就会迎面击来。这个地方有一股很强烈的危险、谎言、魔法和背叛的气息，比我过去闻到过的都要强烈。我们需要保持耳聪目明。”

他们顺着走廊走了回去，轻轻地将门推开。“没事。”斯克罗布说，这是说屋里面没有地下人。然后，他们就都走入了他们之前吃晚饭的房间。

正门现在关上了，挡住了他们最初进来时通过的门帘。骑士坐在一把样子奇怪的银椅中，他的脚踝、膝盖、手肘、手腕和腰部都被捆在了椅子上。他的前额上有涔涔的汗水，表情痛苦。

“进来吧，朋友们，”他飞快地抬头扫了一眼，“我还没有发作。不要出声，我跟那个爱打听的侍从说你们去睡觉了。现在……我能感觉到自己就要发作了。快！在我还能掌控自己的时候听我说。我发作后，可能会恳求你们，乞求你们，威逼利诱你们给我松绑。他们说我会这样。我会跟你们说出最动听的话，也会说出最可怕的话。但不要听我的，你们把心硬起来，把耳朵堵起来。只要我被绑着，你们就是安全的。但只要我能起来，离开这把椅子，我就会发狂，然后——”他打了个哆嗦，“就会变成恶心的毒蛇。”

“不要害怕我们会给你松绑，”普登格伦姆说，“我们不想看到狂人，也不想看到毒蛇。”

“我也觉得不会。”斯克罗布和吉尔异口同声地说。

“反正，”普登格伦姆轻声说，“我们别太确信。我们要保持警惕。你知道，我们已经错过了一切。一旦他发作起来，就会变得非常狡猾，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。我们能信任彼此吗？我们都能发誓说无论他说什么我们都不会去碰那些绳索吗？无论他说什么，可以吗？”

“当然！”斯克罗布说。

“无论他说什么，做什么，都不会让我改变主意。”吉尔说。

“嘘！有变化了。”普登格伦姆说。

骑士开始呻吟。他的脸色苍白，仿佛油灰，他在捆绑中挣扎。不知道是不是对他产生了同情，或是其他原因，吉尔觉得他现在比原来看起来顺眼了一些。

“啊，”他哀号着，“魔法，魔法……沉重、混乱、冰冷、黏湿的邪恶魔法的网。被活埋。被拉入地下，拉入乌黑的黑暗之中……有多少年了……我在坑中活了十年了，还是已经一千年了？我的周围都是蛆人。啊，可怜可怜我。让我出去，让我回去。让我感受风的吹拂，让我看看天空……曾经有一个小水池，当你俯视着它，就能看见所有的树在水中的倒影，一片绿色，在它们下面，深处，很深的深处，是蓝色的天空。”

他一直都低声说着，而现在他抬起头来，眼睛牢牢地盯在他们身上，用洪亮清晰的声音说：　“快！我现在清醒了。每天晚上我会清醒过来。只要我能离开这把魔椅，清醒就能持续下去，我就能再度为人。但每个晚上，他们都会捆住我，因此，每个晚上，我的机会都会失去。但你们不是敌人，我不是你们的囚犯。快！割断这些绳索。”

“站住别动！稳住！”普登格伦姆对两个孩子说。

“我请你们听我说，”骑士强迫自己平静地诉说，“他们是不是告诉你，如果把我从这把椅子中放出，我就会杀了你们，还会变成一条毒蛇？我从你们的表情可以看出来，他们这么说了。这是个谎言。实际上一整天里只有这一个小时我是意识清醒的，剩下的时间我都是中了魔法的状态。你们不是地下人，不是女巫。你们为什么要站在他们那边？求求你们，割开我的绳索。”

“稳住！稳住！稳住！”三个旅行者对彼此说。

“唉，你们的心真像石头一样。”骑士说，“相信我，你们眼前的是个可怜人，遭受了几乎任何凡人都无法承受的苦难。我到底对你们做过什么，会令你们站在我的敌人那一边，让我继续承受这样的痛苦？时间在一分一分地溜走。你们现在可以救我，如果这一个小时过去，我就又会变得愚蠢——像个玩具，像个哈巴狗，不，更像是个小卒子，像个工具，要被最邪恶的女巫利用，给人类带去痛苦。而今晚，不同以往，她不在这里！你们碰上了一个千载难逢的机会，可以将我救出来。”

“这真可怕。我真希望我们能去别处，等到这一切结束。”吉尔说。

“稳住！”普登格伦姆说。

囚犯的声音提高，变成了尖叫。“放开我，我说。把我的剑给我。我的剑！只要我自由了，就会狠狠地报复地下人，让地下世界一千年都不会忘记，都要谈论此事。”

“发狂开始了。”斯克罗布说，“我希望那些绳结够结实。”

“是啊。”普登格伦姆说，“如果他现在获得自由，他的力量肯定会翻倍。我的剑使得不太好。他会干掉我们两个，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪，然后波尔就要独自对抗毒蛇了。”

囚犯现在开始猛烈挣扎，绳索陷入了他的手腕和脚踝。“当心，”他说，“当心。有一天晚上我真的挣断了绳索。不过那个时候女巫在这里。今天晚上你们可没有她帮忙。现在就放开我，我会成为你们的朋友。否则，我会是你们不共戴天的死敌。”

“很狡猾，是不是？”普登格伦姆说。

“机不可失，”囚犯说，“我命令你们放开我。以所有的恐惧和所有的爱，以地上世界的明媚天空，以伟大的狮子，以阿斯兰本人，我要求你们……”

“啊！”三个旅行者齐声惊呼，仿佛都受了伤一样。

“这是指示。”普登格伦姆说。

“这是指示中出现的词语。”斯克罗布说得更加严谨。

“啊，我们该怎么办？”吉尔说。

这是一个很糟糕的问题。如果他们一听到骑士碰巧叫出了他们真正在意的那个名字，就去放开他，那他们刚才彼此承诺无论如何不会去放开他又有什么意义呢？而另一方面，如果不遵照指示行事，那记住那些指示又有什么意义呢？阿斯兰是否真的想让他们给以他的名义提出松绑要求的任何人松绑呢，哪怕是个疯子——只要那人说出了他的名字？这是巧合吗？或者，如果地下世界的女王得知了所有指示，让骑士记住这个名字，只是为了给他们设圈套，那又该怎么办？不过，如果这真的是指示呢？他们已经错过了三个了，他们不敢错过第四个。

“啊，但愿能知道怎么办！”吉尔说。

“我觉得我们的确知道。”普登格伦姆说。

“你是说，你认为，如果我们给他松绑，最后会万事大吉？”斯克罗布说。

“我不知道。”普登格伦姆说，“你们看，阿斯兰没有告诉波尔会发生什么。他只是告诉她该做什么。那个家伙站起来后会杀了我们，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪，但是我们不能因此而不去遵照指示。”

他们站在那里，用明亮的眼睛看着彼此。这是一个令人痛苦的时刻。“好的！”吉尔突然说道，“我们去了结这事。再见，各位！”他们握了握彼此的手。骑士现在开始尖叫起来，满脸是汗。

“来吧，斯克罗布。”普登格伦姆说。他和斯克罗布拔出剑，走向了囚犯。

“以阿斯兰之名。”他们说着，有条不紊地割开了绳子。那个囚犯一获得自由，就一跃跳到了房间的另一面，抓起自己的剑（被捆前剑被从他身边拿开，放在了桌上），拔了出来。

“你是第一个！”他叫道，挥剑砍向了银椅。那肯定是一把利剑，银椅在剑锋之下，就像绳子一样，没一会儿，就只剩下一堆乱七八糟的碎片，在地上闪闪发光了。而就在椅子破裂之时，它突然发出一道亮光和一个如同闷雷的声音，散发出一股恶心的气味（持续了一小会儿）。

“你就躺在那里吧，邪恶的巫术工具！”他说，“以防你的女主人再用你来对付别的受害者。”然后，他转过身来，打量着拯救他的人，而他脸上那种不对劲的东西，无论是什么，此刻都已经消失了。

“什么？”他望着普登格伦姆，惊呼，“我眼前的，是一个沼泽怪——一个真正的、活着的、诚实的纳尼亚的沼泽怪？”

“啊，所以，你是听说过纳尼亚的？”吉尔说。

“我中咒的时候忘了它吗？”骑士问，“好吧，那已经结束了，其他所有的着魔的举动都已经结束了。你们完全可以相信我知道纳尼亚，因为我是瑞利安，纳尼亚的王子，伟大的国王凯斯宾是我的父亲。”

“殿下！”普登格伦姆说着单膝跪地（孩子们也是同样），“我们来到这里，就是为了寻找你，不找到你誓不罢休。”

“我的另外两位救星，你们又是谁？”王子对斯克罗布和吉尔说。

“我们是阿斯兰本人派来的，从世界尽头之外而来，到这里寻找殿下。”斯克罗布说，“我是尤斯塔斯，曾经与国王一起航海到过拉曼杜岛。”

“你们三位的恩情我无以为报。”瑞利安说，“但，我的父亲呢？他还活着吗？”

“在我们离开纳尼亚之前，他又向东方航行了。”普登格伦姆说，“但殿下，你必须想到国王已经很老很老了。陛下十有八九会死在海上。”

“你说他老了。我被女巫控制了多久？”

“自从殿下在纳尼亚北方的树林中失踪，已经过去十年多了。”

“十年！”王子说着，用一只手在脸上抹了一把，仿佛要把过去都抹掉一样，“是的，我相信你。现在，我又变回了自己，我能想起中了魔法时的生活，尽管中了魔法的时候我无法想起真正的我。现在，亲爱的朋友们——等等！我能听到他们上楼的脚步声（那啪啪的软绵绵的脚步声，是不是让人作呕！呸！）。锁上门，男孩。或者，你还是别动。我有了个更好的主意。既然阿斯兰给了我智慧，我要耍耍这些地下人。看我信号行事。”

他毅然走向门口，将门大大地敞开。





第十二章　地下世界的女王


两个地下人走了上来，但他们没有往房间里面走，而是一边一个地站在门两边，然后深深鞠躬。紧接着，出现了这个时候所有人都没有想到也绝对不想见的人：绿裙女士，地下世界的女王。她站在门口，一动不动，他们能够看到她眼珠转动着打量整个屋内的情势——三个陌生人，银椅毁了，王子自由了，手中拿着剑。

她的脸变得刷白，吉尔觉得这并不是那种人们在害怕时会出现的白，而是在生气时会出现的白。女巫的视线牢牢地锁在王子身上好一会儿，眼神中透着杀气。然后，她似乎改变了主意。

“退下。”她对那两个地下人说，“除非我传唤，不要让任何人打扰我们，违令者死。”地精们顺从地离开了，巫女王把门关上，又上了锁。

“怎么了，我尊贵的王子？”她说，“你每晚的发作还没开始吗？还是提前结束了？你为什么站在这里，没有被绑住？这些外人是谁？是他们摧毁了银椅吗？那可是你唯一的安全之所。”

她说话的时候，瑞利安王子打了个哆嗦。这丝毫不奇怪，要想在半小时内摆脱一个奴役了你十年的魔法，那可不容易。然后，他费了很大力气，说：“女士，我不再需要那把椅子了。而你，曾经跟我说过一百次，你是因为我中了巫术而深切地同情我，你听到这魔法已经永远结束了，一定会很开心吧。似乎你对付巫术的方法有点儿小小的错误。而这些人，我真正的朋友们拯救了我。现在，我意识清醒，有两件事情我要对你说。首先——你计划让我担任地下人大军的头领，冲出地面，冲入地上世界，然后依靠武力，让我成为一个从来都没有对我做过丝毫错事的国家的国王，杀死他们本来的大臣，掌握他们的王座，成为一个血腥的异族暴君——而现在，我又知道了自己是谁，我坚决拒绝，并认为这一举动是一种赤裸裸的恶行。第二，我是纳尼亚国王的儿子瑞利安，是凯斯宾十世，航海家凯斯宾唯一的子嗣。因此，女士，我计划——并且也有责任——离开你的王庭，回到我自己的国家。请你授予我和我的朋友们一个安全通行证和一个向导，穿越你的黑暗王国。”

女巫一言未发，只是脚步轻盈地走向房间另一头，她的眼睛和脸始终牢牢地朝向王子。她走到壁炉附近，那里的墙上嵌着一个小柜子，她打开柜子，从中抓出一把绿色的粉末。她将粉末丢到了火上。粉末并没有熊熊燃烧起来，而是散发出了一种令人昏昏欲睡的甜美气息。在接下来的交谈中，这种气息越来越浓，充斥了整个房间，令人难以思考。然后，她又拿出一个很像是曼陀林(1)的乐器，开始用手指弹奏——那是一种沉稳而单调的弹拨声，开头你并不在意，但你越不去注意这声音，这声音却越钻到你脑子里和血液里。这同样会让人难以思考。弹了一会儿之后（这时甜美的气息已经变浓了），她用一种甜美而平静的声音开口说话了。

“纳尼亚？”她说，“纳尼亚？我经常听殿下在发狂时叫出这个名字。亲爱的王子，你病得很严重。没有一个地方叫纳尼亚。”

“有的，是有的，女士，”普登格伦姆说，“你看，我碰巧一生都生活在那里。”

“的确。”女巫说，“那么，我请你告诉我，那个国家在哪里？”

“在上面。”普登格伦姆断然说，他指了指头顶，“我——我不知道具体在哪里。”

“怎么回事？”女王发出了一阵温柔、和缓、如同音乐般的笑声，“在上面的石头和屋顶的泥灰当中有一个国家吗？”

“不是。”普登格伦姆有些勉强地控制着自己的呼吸，“是在地上世界。”

“那是什么，是哪里，这个……你怎么称呼来着……这个地上世界？”

“哎，别装傻了。”斯克罗布努力抗拒着甜味和琴声的魔法，“说得好像你不知道一样！就在上面，在你能看到天空、太阳和星辰的地方。啊，你自己也上去过。我们在那里见过你。”

“请原谅，小弟弟，”女巫笑了（你绝对没听过比那更美好的笑声），“我不记得那次碰面。但我们做梦的时候，总是会在奇怪的地方遇上我们的朋友。除非所有人的梦都一样，否则你不可能叫别人记得那个梦。”

“女士，”王子坚决地说，“我已经告诉你了，我是纳尼亚国王的儿子。”

“会是的，亲爱的朋友，”女巫用一种舒缓的声音说，仿佛是在哄孩子一般，“你会在幻想中成为很多想象中的国度的国王。”

“我们也去过那里。”吉尔厉声说。她非常恼怒，因为她能够感觉到魔法对她的控制愈益增强。不过，她还能感觉到魔法，表明魔法还没有完全见效。

“而你就是纳尼亚的女王了，我毫不怀疑，小可爱。”女巫用同样诱哄又透着嘲弄的语调说。

“完全不是那样的。”吉尔跺了跺脚，“我们来自另外的世界。”

“啊，这个游戏比刚才那个更好玩。”女巫说，“告诉我，小美女，另外的世界在哪里？有什么船只或马车往返于它和我们的世界吗？”

一时之间，吉尔的头脑中涌现出了很多很多东西：实验学校，阿黛拉·彭尼法瑟，她自己的家，收音机，电影院，汽车，飞机，配给供应车，排队。但这一切又都非常模糊非常遥远。（嗡——嗡——嗡，女巫的琴弦发出声响。）吉尔想不起来我们世界中这些东西的名字了。而这一次，她也没有意识到，她是中了魔法，因为现在魔法已经发挥了全部效力。当然，你中的魔法越深，你越会深信自己根本没有中魔法。

她发现自己不知不觉地开始说（当时，这么说倒是让她感觉松了一口气）：“不。我认为另外的世界肯定完全就是一场梦。”

“是的。那完全就是一场梦。”女巫说，她始终都在嗡嗡地弹琴。

“是的，完全是一场梦。”吉尔说。

“从来都没有这样的一个世界。”女巫说。

“是的，”吉尔和斯克罗布说，“从来都没有这样的一个世界。”

“除了我的世界，没有其他世界。”女巫说。

“除了你的世界，没有其他世界。”他们说。

普登格伦姆还在奋力地抵抗魔法。“我真的不知道你们所有人都说的一个世界是什么意思。”他说话的样子很像是透不过气来一般，“但你尽管可以一直弹琴，弹到你手指断掉，也还是不能让我忘记纳尼亚，还有整个的地上世界。我们再也不会见到那个世界了，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。据我所知，你可能会将它吞并，将它变得像这里一样黑暗。这确定无疑。但我知道我曾经生活在那里。我见过满天星斗的天空。我见过太阳在清晨从海上升起，在傍晚落入群山之后。我见过太阳高高挂在中天，阳光明亮得令我无法直视。”

普登格伦姆的话有一种让人清醒的强大效果。其他三个人都开始呼吸，就像刚从睡梦中醒来一样面面相觑。

“啊，是啊！”王子叫道，“当然啦！阿斯兰在庇佑这个诚实的沼泽怪。刚才的几分钟我们全都被催眠了。我们怎么会忘了呢？我们当然全都见过太阳。”

“天啊，是啊！”斯克罗布说，“你太厉害了，普登格伦姆！我相信，你是我们当中唯一一个有理智的。”

这时，女巫的声音又响了起来，轻柔柔，软绵绵，同寂静的夏日下午三点钟，野鸽子从老花园里高高的榆树上发出的叫声一样轻柔。那声音说：“你们说的那个太阳是什么东西？你们这个词有什么意义吗？”

“是的，完全是有的。”斯克罗布说。

“你能告诉我太阳是什么样的吗？”女巫问。（嗡，嗡，嗡，琴弦发出声响。）

“遵命陛下，”王子非常冷静、非常有礼貌，“你看那盏灯。它高高地挂在屋顶上，圆圆的，黄黄的，射出的光芒照亮了整个房间。我们称作太阳的东西，就如同那盏灯，只是要大得多、明亮得多。它高高地挂在天空之上，发出的光能照亮整个地上世界。”

“挂在什么上，殿下？”女巫问，他们都还在想着该如何回答她，她就已经发出了一阵轻柔的银铃般的笑声，接着又说道，“你们明白了没？你们努力地想弄明白这个太阳到底是什么，但又没有办法向我描述。你们只能告诉我说它像一盏灯。你们的太阳就是一个梦，梦里的东西没有一样不是模仿灯的。灯是真实存在的，但太阳只是个传说，是个儿童故事。”

“是的，我明白了。”吉尔用一种沉重的、绝望的声音说，“肯定是这样的。”她这么说的时候，自己觉得这话还是很有道理的。

女巫用缓缓的声音郑重重复道：“没有太阳。”他们什么也没有说。女巫的声音变得更加柔和，更加低沉：“没有太阳。”沉默了片刻，此时他们的脑子里一阵纠结，然后四个人齐声说：“你是对的。没有太阳。”他们说出这句话，就此投降，都觉得如释重负。

“从来都没有太阳。”女巫说。

“没有。从来都没有太阳。”王子、沼泽怪和两个孩子说。

在过去的几分钟里，吉尔一直有种感觉，有些东西，无论付出什么代价，她都必须回想起来。而现在她想起来了。只是要说出来，却感觉困难重重。她觉得她的双唇上仿佛压着特别沉重的东西。最后，她似乎是用尽了身体内所有的力量，说：“有阿斯兰。”

“阿斯兰？”女巫说，她弹琴的速度微微地加快了一点儿，“多好听的名字啊！是什么意思？”

“他是伟大的狮子，将我们从我们自己的世界召唤过来，”斯克罗布说，“然后派我们来这里寻找瑞利安王子。”

“狮子是什么？”女巫问。

“啊，该死的！”斯克罗布说，“你不知道吗？我们该怎么向她描述呢？你见过猫吗？”

“当然，”女王说，“我喜欢猫。”

“呃，狮子就是稍微——只是稍微，请注意——像是一只巨猫——还长着鬃毛。不过，完全不像马的鬃毛，你知道吗？它的鬃毛是黄色的，更像法官的假发。而且狮子极其强壮。”

女巫摇了摇头。“我明白了，”她说，“我们对待你们所谓的狮子的态度，应该和对待你们所谓的太阳一样。你们见过灯，于是就想象出了一盏更大更好的灯，将其称作太阳。你们见过猫，于是就想出了更大更好的猫，称其为狮子。好吧，这就是一场家家酒，不过，说实话，如果你们年纪再小些这样说会更合适的。看看你们，你们置入游戏中的东西，无一不是模仿真实的世界，模仿我的世界，而这是唯一存在的世界。不过，即便是这两个孩子，要玩这种游戏，年纪也太大了。而至于你，我的王子殿下，你是成年人了，真丢脸啊！玩这样的东西你不觉得惭愧吗？好啦，你们所有人。丢开这些孩子气的把戏吧。在这个真实的世界中，我有事情需要你们所有人来做。没有纳尼亚，没有地上世界，没有天空，没有太阳，没有阿斯兰。现在，都上床睡觉吧。我们明天开始更加理智的生活。不过，首先，到床上去，去睡觉，睡得沉沉的，枕着软软的枕头，好好睡，不要做愚蠢的梦。”

王子和两个孩子都垂着头站着，脸颊通红，眼睛半闭，他们身体内的力量都被掏空了，魔法几乎完全见效了。而普登格伦姆，拼死积聚起全身最后的力量，走向了炉火。然后他做了一件非常勇敢的事情。他知道火会烧伤他，但不会像烧伤人那么严重，因为他的脚（光着的）就像鸭子的脚一样，有蹼，十分坚硬，里面的血液是冷的。但他也知道这会令他伤得很重，事实的确如此。他赤足踩上了火堆，将浅浅的壁炉底部的大部分火都碾成了灰。这样一来，立刻就发生了三件事情。

首先，那种浓烈的甜甜的气味变弱了很多。尽管火并没有被完全熄灭，但绝大部分都灭了，而还燃烧着的火中混入了很多沼泽怪被烧伤后的气味，已经完全不是有魔力的气味了。这一下每个人的头脑都立刻清醒多了。王子和孩子们又抬起了头，睁开了眼。

其次，女巫发出了一阵骇人的大叫声，和她刚才一直使用的甜美声调截然不同。她吼道：“你在做什么？烂泥，要是你敢再碰我的火，我就把你血管中的血都变成火烧死你！”

最后，因为疼痛，普登格伦姆的头脑彻底清醒了片刻，他完全明白了自己真正的想法。要解除这种类型的魔法，实在没有什么比得上剧烈的疼痛更有效了。

“再说一句，女士。”他说着从炉火边走了回来，由于疼痛而一瘸一拐的，“再说一句。你刚才所说的一切都是对的，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。但我这个人，总是希望能做好最坏的打算，然后用最乐观的态度去面对。所以，我不会否认你说的任何事情。不过，即便如此，还是有一件事要说。假设我们只是做梦的时候梦到或是编造了那一切——树，草，太阳，月亮，星星，还有阿斯兰。假设我们是做梦。那么我所能说的就是，那样的话，这些编造出来的东西，要比真实的一切重要得多。假设你的这个黑坑一样的王国就是唯一的世界。好吧，我真觉得，这是个相当可怜的世界。你如果仔细想想，这件事很有意思。如果你说的是对的，我们只是玩游戏的孩子。但四个玩游戏的孩子创造出的一个游戏世界，却可以让你这个真实世界显得一无是处。因此，我要支持那个游戏世界。我要支持阿斯兰，哪怕根本没有阿斯兰。我要像纳尼亚人一样生活，哪怕根本没有纳尼亚。好吧，谢谢你盛情招待我们的晚餐，如果这两位先生和这位小姐准备好了，我们就要立刻离开你的王庭，出发到黑暗中，用尽我们的生命，去寻找地上的世界。我们的生命应该不会很长，我觉得，但如果世界就像你说的这么无趣，那也不会是什么大损失。”

“喔喔，万岁！老普登格伦姆太棒了！”斯克罗布和吉尔叫道。

不过王子突然喊道：“小心！快看女巫！”

他们看过去，头发几乎都竖了起来。

她手中的乐器掉在了地上。她的手臂似乎固定在了身体两侧，两条腿纠缠纽结，脚消失不见。她长长的绿裙越来越厚，越来越坚硬，贴上她缠绕在一起的双腿，连成一体，成为一根绿莹莹的柱子。而这根绿莹莹的柱子蜷曲摇摆，仿佛没有关节，又仿佛全身都是关节。她头向后仰，鼻子越来越长，脸上的其他部分都不见了，只剩下一双眼。巨大的火红的双眼，没有眉毛，没有睫毛。把这一切写下来要花很多时间，但实际上发生得非常迅速，他们只看了一眼她就变成了这样。他们还没有来得及做什么，变形就完成了，女巫变成了一条巨大的毒蛇，泛着毒药一般绿幽幽的光，和吉尔的腰一样粗，它已经用它令人恶心的身体在王子腿上缠了两三圈了。它速度快如闪电，又一圈缠了上来，想要将王子握剑的手困在身侧。不过王子于千钧一发之际抓住了时机。他举起手臂，逃脱了束缚：那个有生命的“绳子”只缠在了他的胸口——不过它越收越紧，随时都可能像折断木柴一般挤断他的肋骨。

王子用左手抓住那条蛇的脖子，想要把它掐到窒息。因此，它的脸（如果你能称之为脸的话）距离他的脸只有五英寸远。它分叉的舌头不停地扭动着，从嘴里进进出出，不过就是够不到王子。王子用右手拔出了剑，用他能使出的最大力气挥出。与此同时，斯克罗布和普登格伦姆也都拔出了武器，冲上去帮忙。三个人的剑同时落下：斯克罗布的剑砍到了王子手下面蛇的身体上（连片鳞片都没有砍掉，一点儿作用都没发挥出来），不过王子的剑和普登格伦姆的剑双双落在了蛇的脖子上。即便如此，也没有彻底将它杀死，不过它开始放松了对瑞利安腿部和胸口的束缚。他们不断地砍，一剑又一剑，最终，砍掉了它的头。但这个可怕的东西在死了之后依然继续扭动缠绕，活动了很长一段时间。因而，你能想象，地板变得一片狼藉。

王子缓过气来说：“先生们，谢谢你们。”之后，很长一段时间，三个战士就站在那里，面面相觑，气喘吁吁，一言不发。吉尔非常明智，安安静静地坐在一边。她心中自言自语：“真希望自己不要晕倒，不要哭哭啼啼——也不要做任何蠢事。”

“我母后的大仇得报了。”过了一会儿，瑞利安说，“毫无疑问，这就是很多年前，我在纳尼亚树林的泉水边寻而未获的那个卑鄙的家伙。这些年来，我一直都是杀死我母亲的凶手的奴隶。不过，先生们，我还是很开心，这个邪恶的女巫最后显出了蛇形。不然，要杀死一个女人，我总是难以心安，也感觉有损荣耀。还是照顾一下女士吧。”他指的是吉尔。

“我没事，谢谢。”她说。

“女士，”王子向她鞠躬，“你勇气可嘉，因此，我毫不怀疑，你在你自己的世界中必然出身高贵。不过，好了，朋友们。这儿还有些酒。咱们缓一缓，也祝贺彼此。然后，再研究我们的计划。”

“真是个好主意，先生。”斯克罗布说。

第十三章　没有女王的地下世界


大家都觉得他们已经获得了斯克罗布所说的“喘口气”的时间。女巫刚才把门锁了起来，并且吩咐地下人不要来打扰她，所以，目前没有被人打扰的危险。他们要处理的第一件事情当然就是普登格伦姆烧伤的脚。他们从王子的卧室找到了几件干净的衬衫，撕成一条条的，然后从晚餐桌上拿来黄油和色拉油，在布条内侧涂了厚厚一层，做成了特别好的包扎用的布带。弄好之后，他们都坐下来，休息了一阵，然后开始讨论逃离地下世界的计划。

瑞利安解释说，这儿有很多的出口可以通向地面。他过去经常被女王带着出去，走过大部分的出口。但是他从来都没有单独出去过，每次都是跟女巫一起，而且每一次去这些出口，都要乘船通过无日之海。如果他不是和女巫一起去港口，却是四个陌生人，直接要一艘船，那些地下人会说什么呢，谁也想不到。但很有可能，他们会问一些难堪的问题。不过，那个新出口，也就是准备入侵地上世界的那个，就在海的这一面，只有几英里远。王子知道那里快完工了，只要再挖几英尺，就能通向外面了。甚至现在有可能已经完工了。也许，女巫回来就是要告诉他这个消息，准备发动进攻。即便还没有完工，他们应该仅用几个小时的时间就可以自己挖出去——只要他们能顺利到达那里，不被人阻拦，并且挖掘点那里没有守卫。但是这些正是困难的所在。

“如果你们问我……”普登格伦姆刚开口，就被斯克罗布打断了。

“听，”他问，“那是什么声音？”

“我心里已经纳闷了好一阵子了！”吉尔说。

实际上，他们都听到那个声音有一会儿了，不过那声音是响起后渐渐增强的，所以他们都不知道自己是什么时候开始留意到的。有一段时间，那个声音隐约而模糊，听起来就像是温和的风，或是远处的车声。然后，慢慢增强，变得像是大海的低语声。然后变成了轰轰隆隆的声音。而现在听来像是人声，其中还混杂着不是人声的持续不断的咆哮声。

“狮子在上，”瑞利安王子说，“看来这片沉默的国度似乎终于能开口了。”他站起来，走到窗口，拉开窗帘。其他人也都凑到他身边向外望去。

他们注意到的第一件事情是一大片红光。红光照射在他们上方几千英尺远的地下世界的洞顶上，映射出一大块红斑，因而，他们可以看到一片岩石的屋顶，可能它从创世之初就隐藏在了黑暗之中。那光是从城市的另一端发出的，所以，很多建筑背光而立，形成一片黑色的剪影，肃穆而庄严。但红光还是照射到了很多从它发出的位置通向城堡的街道。在那些街道上，发生了一些非常奇怪的事情。那一群群本来摩肩接踵、悄无声息的地下人都不见了。取而代之的是四处奔散的人，有的独身一人，有的三三两两。他们就像是很不想被别人看到一样，躲到扶壁后面的阴影中，或是藏在门洞里，然后以飞快的速度穿过开阔的地方，跑到下一个躲藏的地点。但对任何了解地精的人来说，其中最奇怪的就是那声音。四面八方都是呐喊和尖叫的声音。从海港传来了一种低沉的呼呼的咆哮声，声音持续不断，越来越大，已经震撼了整个城市。

“地下人怎么了？”斯克罗布说，“是他们在喊吗？”

“不太可能。”王子说，“我在被困住的漫长而无聊的岁月中，从来都没有听过这些混蛋中有谁会大声说话。这是一种新的诡计，我肯定。”

“那边的红光又是什么？”吉尔问，“有东西着火了吗？”

“如果要我说，”普登格伦姆说，“我会说那是地心的火冲了出来，形成了一座新火山。我们很可能就在火山中间，我一点儿都不奇怪。”

“看那艘船！”斯克罗布说，“没有人在划桨，它怎么过来得这么快？”

“快看，快看！”王子说，“那艘船已经靠向海港这边了——它到街道上了。看！所有的船都驶入了城市！天啊，海水在上涨。洪水正朝着我们而来。赞美阿斯兰，这座城堡位于高处。但水涨得可真是飞快啊！”

“啊，接下来会怎么样呢？”吉尔叫道，“又是火，又是水，还有这么多人在街上躲来躲去。”

“我跟你们说这是怎么回事吧，”普登格伦姆说，“女巫施了一串魔咒，所以，只要她被杀了，她的整个王国也就即刻崩溃了。她就是那种人，只要知道杀死她的人五分钟内就会被烧死、被活埋或是被淹死，她就连自己的死也不在乎了。”

“有道理，沼泽朋友，”王子说，“我们的剑砍下了女巫的头，那一击结束了她所有的魔法，而现在，深域王国就要崩溃了。我们马上要迎来的是深域王国的末日。”

“就是这样，殿下，”普登格伦姆说，“除非这碰巧也是整个世界的末日。”

“但我们要留在这里——等着吗？”吉尔倒吸了一口凉气。

“依我之见，不行。”王子说，“我要去救我的马黑煤，还有女巫的马雪花（一匹很高贵的马，值得拥有一个更好的女主人）。两匹马所在的马厩都在庭院里。救出马后，咱们就离开这里去高地，希望能找到一个出口。必要时，两匹马每匹都能驮两个人，我们骑上马，或许可以从洪水中逃脱。”

“殿下你不穿盔甲吗？”普登格伦姆问，“我不喜欢那些东西的样子。”——他指着下方的街道。大家全都望了下去。几十个东西从海港的不同方向扑来（近了一些，可以很清楚地看出来是地下人）。但从他们移动的方式看，他们不是漫无目的的乌合之众,而像是攻击中的现代士兵，冲锋，寻找掩护，努力不被城堡窗户这边的人注意到。

“我不敢再看那盔甲里面的样子。”王子说，“我穿着它的时候就像穿着一座移动的地牢，里面有魔法和奴役的恶臭。不过我会带上盾牌。”

他离开房间，过了一会儿回来时，眼神中闪耀着一种奇异的神采。

“听着，朋友们，”他把盾牌举到他们面前，“一个小时前，它是黑色的，毫无装饰，而现在，它变成了这样。”盾牌变得明亮如银，上面有鲜红的印记，比血和浆果都要红的印记，是一头狮子。

“无疑，”王子说，“这表明阿斯兰是我们善良的神，无论他为我们安排的是生是死。一切都没有差别。好啦，依我之见，我们应该跪下朝拜亲吻他的肖像，然后握握彼此的手，就像不久之后或许就要分散的真正的朋友一般。然后，我们就冲入城市，开始这场我们的冒险。”

他们都按照王子所说的话行事。当斯克罗布和吉尔握手之时，他说：“别了，吉尔。很抱歉我一直是个胆小鬼，还爱乱发脾气。我希望你能安全返家。”而吉尔说：“别了，尤斯塔斯。很抱歉我一直是个蠢猪。”这是他们第一次称呼彼此的教名，因为在学校里大家都不叫名字的。

王子打开门，他们都顺着楼梯走下去：三个男人手中拿着出鞘的长剑，吉尔拿着出鞘的刀。侍从已经不知去向，王子楼梯下面的大房间空荡荡的。那种灰蒙蒙的令人沮丧的灯依然燃着，借助这些灯光，他们毫不费力地穿过一道道走廊，走下一道道楼梯。他们在上面的房间里时，城堡外面的声音听起来并不清晰。而城堡里面，依然死一般寂静，似乎空无一人。他们拐过一个角落，进入一楼的大厅时，才第一次遇到了地下人——那是一个苍白的胖子，长着猪一样的脸，正狼吞虎咽地把桌上所剩的食物全都吞入肚中。他哼哼着（也像猪的叫声一样）藏到一把长椅下面，长尾巴一晃，刚好躲开了普登格伦姆。然后他就飞速地冲向了远处的门，速度太快，他们根本追不上。

他们走出大厅，来到庭院。吉尔在放假时曾经上过骑术课，这时她闻到了一股马厩的气味（在地下世界这样的地方，闻到这种气味，真的感觉亲切又真实，仿佛回到了家一般）。而这时尤斯塔斯说：“老天爷啊！快看那边！”一根巨大的火箭从城堡墙外升起，然后碎裂成点点绿幽幽的星光。

“焰火！”吉尔迷惑地说。

“是的。”尤斯塔斯说，“但那些地下人不可能为了找乐子放焰火！这肯定是个信号！”

“而这对我们来说可不是什么好事，我敢打赌。”普登格伦姆说。

“朋友们，”王子说，“当一个人要开始这样的冒险时，就必须告别所有的希望与恐惧，否则，无论死亡还是救赎，都来不及拯救他的荣誉和理智。嘿，美人们，”他打开了马厩门，“嘿，兄弟们！稳住，黑煤！轻轻的，雪花！你们没被人忘掉。”

两匹马都被奇怪的光和动静吓坏了。吉尔虽然之前很害怕在山洞之间的黑洞穿行，现在却毫无畏惧地走到了两匹跺着蹄子、喷着响鼻的马中间，她和王子没用几分钟，就给两匹马上好了马鞍，拴好了缰绳。离开马厩冲入庭院时它们雄赳赳地摇晃着脑袋。吉尔骑在雪花身上，普登格伦姆在她身后，尤斯塔斯在王子身后，与他共骑黑煤。随着一阵马蹄的回响声，他们冲出城堡大门，进入了街道。

“被烧伤的危险不大，这是好的一面。”普登格伦姆指了指他们右边。距离大约一百码远的地方，流水拍打着房屋的墙壁。

“要勇敢！”王子说，“那边的路很陡，水只爬到了城市最高峰的一半。开头半小时海水离我们可能很近，但接下来两小时就不会更近。我更担心那个……”他用他的剑指着一个长着公猪獠牙的又高又大的地下人，后面跟着六个体型和外形都各式各样的人，他们刚跑出一条小街，藏入人们看不见的屋子的阴影里。

王子领着大家，一直朝着鲜艳的红光偏左一些的方向而去。他计划绕过那处火（如果是火的话），到高地上去，希望能找到通往新挖的出口的路。和其他三个人不同，他似乎非常轻松，简直自得其乐。他一边骑马向前，一边吹着口哨，有时候还会唱一首关于阿钦兰王国“霹雳拳”柯林的一首老歌的片段。事实上，他真的很开心能够解脱长久以来施加在他身上的魔咒，所以在他眼中，其他所有的危险相比之下都不过是儿戏罢了。但是其他人却觉得这是一段可怕的旅程。

身后，传来船只相撞、纠缠的声音，和建筑物轰轰坍塌的声音。头顶，地下世界的洞顶上有一大片血红色的光。前方就是那神秘莫测的光，它看起来一点儿都没有变大。从那个方向还传来了持续不断的嘶吼声、呐喊声、怪叫声、哄笑声、尖叫声和咆哮声，各种各样的焰火升入黑暗的空中。没有人能猜出来那些焰火有什么含义。离他们不远的地方，城市已经有一部分被红光照亮了，而还有一部分依然是那死气沉沉的地下人的灯亮着，两者截然不同。但是还有很多地方一点儿光都没有，一片乌黑。始终都有地下人的身影从这些地方飞奔着进进出出，一闪而过，他们始终都把目光锁定在旅行者身上，又始终努力隐藏着自己，避免被对方看到。他们有大脸的，有小脸的，有长着鱼眼一样的巨眼的，也有长着熊眼一样的小眼的。有长羽毛的，有长鬃毛的，有长犄角的，有长獠牙的，有长着鞭绳一样的鼻子的，有长着长长的像胡子一样的下巴的。时不时地，他们会聚起一大群，或是它们靠得太近。王子这时就会挥动长剑，装出要打他们的架势。而那些生物，就会发出各种怪叫声，呜呜呜，唧唧唧，咯咯咯，四散奔逃，藏入黑暗中。

但当他们爬上一条又一条陡峭的街道，远离了洪水，几乎已经出城，到了内陆的一面的时候，事情也变得更加麻烦了。现在，他们离红光非常接近，几乎已经和它处在同一个高度上了，不过他们依然看不出来那到底是什么。而在红光的照耀下，他们能更加清楚地看到他们的敌人。好几百——也可能有好几千——的地精全都向着红光移动。他们都是一小段一小段地向前冲，只要停下脚步，他们就望向旅行者们。

“如果殿下听我一言，”普登格伦姆说，“我要说这些家伙是想绕到前面截住我们。”

“我也是这么想的，普登格伦姆，”王子说，“面对这么多人，我们绝对杀不出去。听着！咱们骑到那边的房子边缘，再沿着它骑马向前。我们靠近那里后，你务必悄悄躲入阴影中。小姐和我再向前一些。那样，有些魔鬼就会来追我们，我肯定；他们会聚集起一大批，跟在我们后面。你，你有长手臂，如果可以，就趁他们经过你的埋伏时活捉一个。我们也许可以从他嘴里得知真实情况，或是搞明白他们为什么要和我起冲突。”

“不过，其他人会不会都冲向我们，以救回被我们抓住的那个？”吉尔努力让自己镇定一些，不过并不太成功。

“那么，女士，”王子说，“你会看到我们在你身边殊死战斗保护你，而你必须把自己的命交给狮子了。行动吧，好普登格伦姆。”

沼泽怪悄悄溜入阴影中，动作敏捷得像一只猫。其他人继续向前走了大约一分钟，这一分钟着实难挨。这时，后面突然传来一串可怕得令人血液凝结的尖叫声，其中还夹杂着他们熟悉的普登格伦姆的声音：“得啦！趁你还好好的不要叫了，否则你真的会受伤的，明白吗？其他人听到还以为是在杀猪呢。”

“出师大捷！”王子立刻调转黑煤的马头，回到房子的角落里。“尤斯塔斯，”他说，“麻烦你，掌着黑煤的缰绳。”然后他下了马，三个人都沉默地望着，等待普登格伦姆将他的俘虏从黑暗中拖出来。这简直是最差劲的一个地精了，只有大约三英尺高。头顶上长了一个类似鸡冠的凸起（只是要硬很多），小小的粉色眼睛，嘴和下巴都很大，脸长得就像一只发育不良的小河马。如果不是在这样一个紧张的情形下看见它这副模样，大家肯定会大笑起来的。

“听着，地下人，”王子站在他旁边俯视着他，手里的剑尖非常靠近俘虏的脖子，“说话，做个诚实的地精，然后你就自由了。敢和我们耍无赖，你就是个死地下人。好普登格伦姆，你把他的嘴捏得那么牢，他能开口说话吗？”

“不能，这样他也不能咬人。”普登格伦姆说，“如果我的手和你们人类一样软得要命（尊贵的殿下除外），我现在已经浑身是血了。即便是沼泽怪，也不喜欢老被他咬啊。”

“小子，”王子对地精说，“再咬一口，你就死定了。让他的嘴张开吧，普登格伦姆。”

“哎哟——哟——哟，”地下人尖叫道，“放开我，放开我。不是我。我没做。”

“没做什么？”普登格伦姆说。

“无论殿下说我做了什么，我都没做。”那个家伙回答说。

“告诉我你的名字。”王子说，“还有，你们地下人今天要干什么。”

“啊，拜托，殿下，求你了，好心的先生，”地下精灵抽泣着说，“请保证你不会把我说的任何事情告诉给女王陛下。”

“你所说的女王陛下，”王子厉声回答，“已经死了。我亲手杀了她。”

“什么？”地精叫道，他那本就夸张的嘴巴因为惊奇越张越大，“死了？女巫死了？殿下动的手？”他如释重负地长出了一口气，然后说，“哎呀，这么说，殿下是朋友！”

王子把剑向后收了一寸左右。普登格伦姆让地下人坐了起来。他转动着闪烁的红眼睛，打量了一下四个旅行者，咯咯笑了两声，然后开始讲述。





第十四章　世界底层


“我叫高尔戈，”地精说，“我会把我所知道的一切都告诉殿下。大约一个小时前，我们都在忙着我们的活计——她的活计，我该说——沮丧而沉默，一如既往，我们日复一日年复一年都是这样的。然后，传来了哐啷的一声巨响。一听到这个声音，大家都开始自言自语，我已经很长时间没有唱过歌、跳过舞、放过爆竹了，为什么呢？每个人都心里想着，哎呀，我肯定是中了魔法。然后，每个人都对自己说：真希望能知道我为什么要搬这些重物，我再也不要搬了，就这样。我们都把自己的口袋、包袱和工具扔到了一边。然后大家都转头，看到了那边巨大的红光。每个人都对自己说：那是什么呢？然后每个人都回答自己：那是一道裂缝，或断层，是从我们下方一千英寻的真正的深层国度冒上来的美好暖光。”

“老天爷啊，”尤斯塔斯惊呼，“下面还有其他国度？”

“啊，是啊，阁下。”高尔戈说，“很美丽的地方，我们称之为毕斯莫。而我们现在所在的这个国家，女巫的国家，被我们称作浅地。这里距离地表太近了，不适合我们生活。噢！你们应该是生活在外面的，生活在地表之上的。你们看，我们都是来自毕斯莫的可怜地精，女巫用魔法把我们召唤上来，给她干活。但我们把一切都忘了，直到那声巨响，咒语被打破。过去，我们不知道自己是谁，来自哪里。我们什么也做不了，什么也想不了，脑袋里只有被她放进去的东西。而那些年当中，她放进我们头脑里的都是阴郁黑暗的事情。我几乎已经忘了该怎么开玩笑，怎么跳舞。但那声巨响传来，那边的裂缝打开，海水开始上升，一切就都回到了我的脑中。当然，我们全都尽快出发，以便能到达裂缝，回到我们自己的家乡。你可以看那边，他们都在开心地放焰火，手舞足蹈，甚至倒立着行走。如果殿下能尽快放了我，让我加入其中，我会不胜感激。”

“我觉得这真的太棒了，”吉尔说，“我很开心我们砍断了女巫的头，这一举动既解救了我们自己，也令地精们重获自由！而且我真的开心他们实际上并不那么可怕和沮丧，正如王子其实也并不是……呃，看上去那副模样。”

“那的确很好，波尔，”普登格伦姆谨慎地说，“但在我看来，那些地精不太像只想逃跑的人。要我说，他们更像是行军的编队。看着我的脸，高尔戈先生，跟我说，你们并没有在准备大战。”

“我们当然在准备啊，阁下，”高尔戈说，“你看，我们不知道女巫已经死了。我们还以为她正在城堡上看着呢。我们尽量悄悄地行动，避免被发现。然后你们四个骑着马拿着剑从城堡里出来，每个人当然都会对自己说战争开始了，谁也不知道殿下不是女巫那边的。我们都决心要大战一场，无论如何也不会放弃返回毕斯莫的希望。”

“我敢发誓这是个诚实的地精。”王子说，“放了他吧，朋友普登格伦姆。至于我，好高尔戈，我也像你以及你的同伴一样中了魔咒，也刚刚才记起我自己是谁。现在只问你一件事。你知道去新的挖掘点的路吗？就是女巫准备率领大军攻入地上世界的那个。”

“咦……咦……咦！”高尔戈尖叫道，“是的，我知道那条可怕的路。我可以指给你们它的起点在哪里。但殿下如果叫我跟你一起去，那没有半点儿用。我宁愿去死。”

“为什么？”尤斯塔斯好奇地问，“那条路有什么可怕的地方？”

“距离顶部太近了，距离外面太近了。”高尔戈打着哆嗦说，“这是女巫对我们做的最坏的事情了。她打算带我们从那里出去——上到外面的世界中去。他们说那里根本没有顶，只有一片被称作天空的巨大而可怕的虚空。而挖掘的地方已经特别靠上，再挖几下就能到外面去了。我不敢靠近。”

“好哇！现在说到重点了！”尤斯塔斯叫道。吉尔说：“不过上面一点儿都不可怕。我们很喜欢那儿，我们就住在那里。”

“我知道你们地上人住在那里。”高尔戈说，“不过我觉得这只是因为你们找不到下来的路。你们不会真的喜欢那里——像苍蝇一样在世界顶上爬来爬去。”

“现在就把那条路指给我们好吗？”普登格伦姆说。

“正是时候！”王子叫道。他们这一群人就此出发了。王子上了坐骑，普登格伦姆也爬上马坐在了吉尔身后，高尔戈在前面带路。他一路走，一路不停地大声地喊出好消息：女巫已经死了，这四个地上人没有危险。而那些听到他的话的人又把消息传递给其他人，所以，没一会儿，整个地下世界都响起了呐喊声和欢呼声，成百上千的地精雀跃舞蹈，翻着跟斗，或是倒立着，玩着青蛙跳，点燃大爆竹，聚集在黑煤和雪花周围。王子不得不将他自己中了魔法然后解除魔法的故事讲了至少十遍。

他们就这样一路来到了裂缝的边缘。那条裂缝大约一千英尺长，可能有两百英尺宽。他们都从马上下来，来到边缘处，向下望。一股强烈的热浪迎面扑来，其中还混杂着一种他们从来都没有闻到过的味道。那味道浓郁、刺激、令人亢奋，还会让人打喷嚏。裂缝的深处一片明亮，起初他们的眼都花了，根本什么都看不到。等他们适应了之后，他们觉得能够辨别出一条流动着火焰的河流，而在河岸上，似乎是田地和果园，放射着令人难以直视的热腾腾的光彩——尽管相比河流来说它们已经算是暗淡的了。那里蓝红绿白，各种颜色凑在一起——一块非常好看的彩色玻璃在正午时分热带太阳的直射下，可能会营造出差不多的视觉效果来。在强光的照射下，成百上千的地下人黑压压一片仿佛苍蝇一般在裂缝凹凸不平的侧壁上向下爬。

“阁下们，”高尔戈说（他们转头看他时，有好一会儿什么都看不见，只看到一团黑，他们的眼睛都花了），“阁下们，你们为什么不下去到毕斯莫去呢？到那里生活，你们会觉得比在上面的直接裸露而毫无保护的寒冷国度要开心得多。至少下去稍微参观一下吧。”

有一瞬间，吉尔理所当然地认为其他人都不会听从这样的建议。然而令她大为惊恐的是，她听到王子开口说：“的确，朋友高尔戈，我有些想和你一起下去。因为这将是一次不可思议的冒险，可能没有一个凡人曾去过毕斯莫，甚至将来也不会再有此良机。而且，将来一年年过去，我不知道，当回想起我曾经有能力去探索地球的最深处却望而却步时，自己是否可以承受。不过，人在那里能活吗？你们不会在火河中游泳吧？”

“啊，不，殿下，我们不游。只有火蜥蜴住在火里面。”

“你们的火蜥蜴是种什么动物呢？”王子问。

“很难描述他们这个物种，殿下，”高尔戈说，“因为他们浑身雪白浑身发热，根本没有办法观察。但他们很像小型的龙。他们在火里和我们说话。他们真的非常能说会道，反应敏捷，雄辩善言。”

吉尔匆忙瞥了尤斯塔斯一眼。她肯定他比自己还要不喜欢爬下裂缝这个主意。但看到他的脸色变化之后，她的心沉了下来。他那副样子，看起来像王子，而不像实验学校里的斯克罗布。因为在这一刻，他昔日所经历的全部冒险，他与国王凯斯宾一起航行的日子，又都回到了他心中。

“殿下，”他说，“如果我的老朋友老鼠雷佩契普在这里，他会说，我们无法拒绝毕斯莫的冒险，否则会极大地有损我们的荣誉。”

“下去吧。”高尔戈说，“我可以带你们去看真正的金子，真正的银子，真正的钻石。”

“胡扯！”吉尔粗鲁地说，“说得就像我们不知道我们在这里就已经是在最深的矿下面一样。”

“的确，”高尔戈说，“我听说过被你们地上居民称作矿的那种上层的小小擦痕。但在那里你得到的是死去的金，死去的银，死去的宝石。而在毕斯莫，这些都是活生生的，会生长的。在那里，我可以摘下成串的红宝石给你们吃，还能给你们榨满满一杯钻石汁喝。当你在毕斯莫品尝过活的这些后，就根本不会想碰你们浅矿中那些冷冰冰的死了的财宝了。”

“我父亲曾去过世界尽头。”瑞利安若有所思地说，“如果他的儿子能去世界的底层，将会是一件了不起的事情。”

“如果殿下想在你父亲活着的时候见到他，我想他可是求之不得呢，”普登格伦姆说，“现在我们差不多该上路去挖掘点了。”

“我不会下到那个洞里去，不管谁说什么。”吉尔接着说。

“哎呀，如果阁下们真的准备回到地上世界，”高尔戈说，“有一段路可能比这还低呢。而且如果洪水继续上涨，可能……”

“啊，拜托了，拜托了，拜托了，咱们快走吧！”吉尔恳求道。

“恐怕必须走了。”王子深深地叹了一口气，“但我觉得自己有一半的心留在了毕斯莫。”

“求求你了！”吉尔恳求道。

“那条路在哪里？”普登格伦姆问。

“沿路都有灯。”高尔戈说，“阁下可以在裂缝那一边看到路的起点。”

“那些灯能燃多久？”普登格伦姆问。

就在那时，有一种嘶嘶嘶的声音，仿佛是火本身发出来的声音一般（后来，他们猜测可能是一只火蜥蜴的声音），从毕斯莫的深渊中呼啸着传了上来。

“快！快！快！去悬崖！去悬崖！去悬崖！”那声音说，“裂口要合上了。合上了。合上了。快！快！”与此同时，随着震耳欲聋的轰隆声，石头开始移动。等他们再看时，裂缝已经变窄了。每一个方向都有迟到的地精急匆匆地冲入裂缝。他们来不及顺着石头爬下去了。他们猛冲过去，可能是由于从下面冒上来的热气太强烈，或是其他原因，可以看到他们如同树叶一样飘飘荡荡地向下落。飘动的地下人越来越多，一层层地越来越厚，他们黑色的身影几乎将下面的火河和活宝石果园的光都给遮挡住了。

“再见，阁下们，我要走了。”高尔戈大叫一声，跳了下去。跟在他身后的人已经很少了。现在裂缝的宽度和一条小溪差不多。然后就变得跟邮筒上的开口那样窄，再然后几乎只剩下一条闪亮的线。最后，传来一声如同一千节货车车厢撞上一千对缓冲器时发出的巨响，那道岩石的裂缝合上了。热烘烘的让人发狂的热气消失了。现在只剩下几个旅行者孤零零地留在地下世界，这里似乎比原来更黑了。只有那些苍白、暗淡、死气沉沉的灯光显示出了路的方向。

“走吧，”普登格伦姆说，“我们十有八九待得太久了，不过还是可以试一试。那些灯五分钟内就会熄灭，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。”

他们催马小跑起来，伴着隆隆马蹄声，神气十足地沿昏黑的路而去。不过，刚一上路，他们就开始下坡。如果不是看到在山谷对面还有灯光并且一直向上，一直延伸到他们看不到的地方，他们都会认为高尔戈指错了路。不过，到了山谷底部，灯光照到的就是流水了。

“快！”王子叫道。他们沿着斜坡飞驰而下。只要再晚五分钟，下面的情况就会变得非常棘手，因为洪水正汹涌地灌入山谷，如果弄得必须游过去，那么这两匹马恐怕就不大行了。不过，现在还只有一两英尺深，尽管水流在马腿边刷刷打转，但他们还是安全地到了河对岸。

然后，他们缓慢而疲倦地爬上了山，视力所及之处，除了持续向上的昏暗灯光，别无他物。他们回头望，看到水已经漫延开了。地下世界的所有山峰都变成了岛屿，而且只有那些岛屿上还有灯。每时每刻，都有一些隐约的灯光消失不见。很快，除了他们走的这条路，到处都会变得一片漆黑，他们身后地势低的地方，虽然灯还没灭，但灯光却都照在水上了。

尽管他们必须赶路，不过马却不能永远不休息。他们停了下来，在一片寂静之中，可以听到水拍打山石的声音。

“我想知道，他叫什么名字来着——时间老爹——现在是不是被大水冲走了。”吉尔说，“还有那些奇怪的睡着的动物。”

“我觉得我们还没到那么高。”尤斯塔斯说，“你还记得我们到达无日之海之前走了多少下坡路吗？我觉得水应该还没涨到时间老爹的洞窟。”

“这也有可能。”普登格伦姆说，“我更好奇这条路上的那些灯。看着有点儿暗，是不是？”

“一直是这样。”吉尔说。

“是啊，”普登格伦姆说，“不过，现在又绿了一些。”

“你不是说，你觉得它们要熄灭了吧？”尤斯塔斯叫道。

“好吧，不管是怎么回事，你总不能认为它们永远都会亮着，你知道的。”沼泽怪回答，“但别沮丧，斯克罗布。我还观察了一下水势，感觉水面上升的速度没有之前那么快了。”

“小小的安慰，朋友。”王子说，“如果我们找不到出去的路，我要恳请你们的原谅，你们所有人。应该怪我，我因为骄傲和幻想，在毕斯莫国的入口处拖延大家太久了。好啦，咱们上马接着走吧。”

在接下来大约一个小时的时间里，吉尔有时觉得普登格伦姆关于灯的说法是对的，有时又觉得这只是他的想象。而在这个过程中，地势发生了变化。地下世界的顶层越来越近，即使在暗淡的灯光下，他们也能看得清清楚楚。而地下世界凹凸不平的大墙壁也能明显地看出来正从周围向他们收缩。那条引着他们向上的路，已经渐渐变成了一个陡峭的隧道。他们走过的路上开始出现铁镐、铁锹和手推车，以及其他说明挖坑工不久前还在此干活的痕迹。如果确信可以出去，那么这一切都是非常振奋人心的。但是要进入一个会变得越来越窄的洞，而且窄得都很难转身，却是让人很不开心的。

最后，顶层变得太低了，普登格伦姆和王子都撞到了头。他们从马上下来，牵着马前行。到了这里，路开始崎岖不平，落脚时必须谨慎小心。正因如此，吉尔注意到了渐渐浓重的黑暗。这点现在毫无疑问了。在绿幽幽的光中，其他人的脸看起来怪怪的，仿佛鬼魅。突然之间吉尔发出了一声小小的尖叫（她是真的忍不住）。而就在此时，有一盏灯，就是他们前面的那一盏，熄灭了。他们后面的那盏也熄灭了。然后，他们陷入了彻底的黑暗。

“要勇敢，朋友们，”瑞利安王子的声音传来，“无论我们是生是死，阿斯兰都是我们善良的神。”

“没错，殿下，”普登格伦姆的声音说，“你们绝对不要忘记，如果我们被困在这里，总是有一个好处的，这样就省了葬礼的花销了。”

吉尔咬住了自己的舌头。（如果你不希望其他人知道你有多害怕，这总是一个聪明的办法，将你出卖的正是你的声音。）

“我们与其在这儿站着，还不如向前走。”尤斯塔斯说，吉尔听到了他声音中的颤抖，于是觉得自己非常明智，没有信任自己的声音。

普登格伦姆和尤斯塔斯走在前面，他们把手臂探在前面摸索着，害怕会撞到什么，吉尔和王子牵着马跟在后面。

“我说，”过了好一阵，尤斯塔斯的声音传来，“是我的眼花了，还是上面真的有道光？”

别人还没来得及回答，普登格伦姆就叫道：“停步，我碰到头了。这是泥土，不是岩石。你刚说什么，斯克罗布？”

“狮子在上，”王子说，“尤斯塔斯说的没错。是有一种……”

“不过不是日光，”吉尔说，“只是一种冷冷的蓝光。”

“总比什么也没有强。”尤斯塔斯说，“我们能够得到吗？”

“那道光没在我们的头顶上。”普登格伦姆说，“在我们上方，不过是在我刚碰到的墙里面。波尔，你踩在我的肩膀上，看看能不能够到，你觉得怎么样？”





第十五章　吉尔消失了


那道光并没有照亮他们所处的那片黑暗中的任何东西。其他人看不到吉尔费力地爬到沼泽怪背上的过程，只能听到动静。他们听到他说“你不需要把手指伸到我的眼睛里”，然后，“也不要把脚踩在我嘴里”，再然后，“现在比较像样”，再然后，“好啦，我会扶着你的腿，你的手臂可以腾出来，撑着泥土，稳住身子”。

然后，他们抬头看，很快就看到了吉尔的脑袋在那道光中的黑色轮廓。

“怎么样？”他们好奇地齐声叫道。

“是个洞。”吉尔的声音叫道，“如果我能再高点儿，就可以钻进去。”

“你从洞口能看到什么？”尤斯塔斯问。

“不太多。”吉尔说，“我说，普登格伦姆，松开我的腿，我不坐在你的肩膀上了，我要站上去。我扶着洞口，完全能稳住。”

他们能听到她移动的声音，然后就看到她的大半个身子出现在灰蒙蒙的洞口，实际上，是她的整个腰部以上。

“我说……”吉尔开口，但突然之间变成了一声惊呼，不是特别尖锐的惊呼。听起来好像是她的嘴被捂住了，或是有什么东西塞进了她嘴里。后来，她又能说话了，似乎在用自己最大的声音喊叫，然而，他们都听不清她说了什么。就在那一瞬间，同时发生了两件事情。首先，那道光被完全遮住了一秒左右；其次，他们听到了扭打挣扎的声音，还有沼泽怪气喘吁吁的说话声：“快！来帮忙！抓住她的腿！有人在拉她。那边！不，这边！太晚了！”

那个洞口，以及照入洞口的冷冷的光，此刻又一清二楚了。而吉尔已经不见了。

“吉尔！吉尔！”他们发疯一般地叫着，但没有回应。

“你到底为什么没拉住她的脚？”尤斯塔斯说。

“不知道，斯克罗布，”普登格伦姆低声说，“生来就时运不济，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。命中注定。命中注定我害死波尔，就像我命中注定在哈方吃了说话的公鹿。不过，当然，这并不是说不是我的错。”

“这是我们遭遇的最大的耻辱和悲伤。”王子说，“我们将一位勇敢的小姐推入了敌人之手，自己却安全地留在后面。”

“不要说得那么坏，殿下。”普登格伦姆说，“我们并不怎么安全，除非待在这个洞里面饿死。”

“我想知道我的身形够不够小，能不能从吉尔过去的地方过去？”尤斯塔斯说。

吉尔遇到的事情，实际上是这样的。她刚一把头探出洞口，就发现自己像是从楼上的窗户向下看，而不像是从天窗向上看。她在黑暗中待得太久了，一开始眼睛都不太适应，没明白自己看到的东西：只是她肯定自己没有看到她非常渴望的阳光照耀的世界。空气冷得要命，光是灰暗幽蓝的。还有不少动静，有很多白色的东西在空中飞来飞去。就在那时，她对普登格伦姆说让她站在他的肩膀上。

她站起来后，看得更清楚了，听得也清楚了很多。她实际上听到了两种声音：一种是有节奏的跺脚声，另一种是四把小提琴、三管笛子和一个鼓共同奏出的音乐。她也搞清楚了自己所处的位置。她正从一个陡峭的坡上的洞口向外看，向下大约有十四英尺才到地平面。目之所及的一切都是白色的。很多人在那里移动。这时，她倒吸了一口气！那些是衣着整洁的小半羊怪，以及头戴树叶王冠、头发在身后飞舞的树精。最开始的一瞬，吉尔觉得他们就像是在随随便便地走来走去，然后，她看出来，他们实际上是在跳一种舞蹈——一种有很多复杂舞步和动作的舞蹈，需要看上一会儿才能明白。然后，她如遭雷击一般恍然大悟，那种暗淡的蓝光实际上是月光，而地面上白色的东西实际上是雪。哎呀，当然啦！头顶黑漆漆的寒冷的天幕上挂着星星。而那些舞蹈者后面高大的黑色物体是树木。最终，他们不仅仅来到了地上世界，而且还来到了纳尼亚的中心地带。吉尔觉得她开心得就要晕过去了，而那音乐——那狂野的音乐，极为动听，不过也透着一点点儿怪诞，充满了善的魔法，就如同女巫的琴声中充满恶的魔法一样——这令她感到更加开心了。

把这些讲出来要花很长的时间，但真正的看的过程当然只是一瞬。吉尔几乎是立刻就向她下方的其他人呼喊：“我说！没事了。我们出去了，我们回家了。”而她只说了“我说”，没说完后面的话，原因如下。在跳舞者外面围着一圈圈的矮人，他们都穿着最精美的服装，几乎都是带毛皮镶边的兜帽和金色流苏的红衣，以及大大的长筒翻毛皮靴。他们围成圈子，全都在不知疲倦地抛着雪球。（吉尔刚才看到在空中飞来飞去的白色东西就是雪球。）他们并不像英国的愚蠢男孩那样把雪球砸向舞者，而是将雪球从舞者中间丢过去，和音乐完美合拍，准头又好，如果所有舞者都在正确的时间处于正确的位置，那么没有一个人会被击中。这就是“大雪球舞”，在纳尼亚，每年白雪覆盖大地后的第一个有月光的晚上都会跳这种舞。当然，这既是一种舞蹈，也是一种游戏，因为时不时地会有舞者出一点儿小错，被一个雪球砸中脸部，惹来大家一阵爆笑。但一队配合得很好的舞者、矮人和乐手，可以持续好几个小时也不会砸中一个人。在晴朗的夜晚，凛冽的寒意、咚咚的鼓声、呜呜的猫头鹰的啸叫声、皎洁的月光，都会渗入他们狂野的林地人的血液中，令他们变得更加狂野，他们会一直跳到天亮。我真希望你们能亲眼看看。

令吉尔只说了“我说”就住口的一个原因，当然就是一个大雪球从另一边的矮人手中飞出，飞过舞蹈的人群，正打中了吉尔的嘴巴。可她一点儿都不在意，在那个时候，即便是有二十个雪球也不会浇灭她的热情。不过，就算你再开心，嘴里都是雪也是没有办法说话的。而经过相当长的一阵子的开不了口的支支吾吾之后，她终于又能说话了。她实在太兴奋，以致忘记了在她身后下方黑暗中的其他人都还不知道这个好消息呢。她只是尽量把身子探到洞外，冲着舞蹈者们大叫：“救命！救命！我们被埋在山里了。快来把我们挖出去。”

那些纳尼亚人起初根本没有注意到山麓上有一个小洞，此时当然大吃一惊。他们四处打量了好久，才最终找到了声音的来源。一看到吉尔，他们就全都跑了过来，纷纷地往上爬，有十几双手伸向了她。吉尔握住他们的手，从洞中出来，倒头朝下从山坡滑了下去，然后站起身来，说：“啊，请去把其他人挖出来吧。还有三个人，还有马。其中一个是瑞利安王子。”

她说这话的时候，已经被人群围了起来，除了跳舞的人以外，还有各种各样的人在看跳舞，起初吉尔没有看见，此刻他们都跑了过来。松鼠仿佛雨点一样纷纷从树里面冒了出来，猫头鹰也跟着钻了出来。刺猬撒开小短腿，以他们最快的速度摇摇摆摆地飞奔而来。熊和獾缓缓地跟在后面。有一头大豹子，兴奋地摆动着尾巴，是最后一个过来的。

他们一听明白吉尔在说什么，就立刻行动了起来。“镐和铲子，孩子们，拿镐和铲子来。去拿我们的工具！”矮人们说着全速奔入树林中。“把鼹鼠叫醒，他们都擅长挖掘，和矮人一样厉害。”一个声音说。“她说的瑞利安王子是怎么回事？”另一个声音说。“嘘！”豹子说，“这可怜的孩子肯定疯了，迷失在山里面，经历了这一切，肯定疯了。她不知道自己说了什么。”“是这回事。”一头老熊说，“噢，对，她说瑞利安王子是一匹马！”“不，她没说。”一只松鼠非常泼辣地说。“说了，她说了。”另一只松鼠更加泼辣。

“是真……真……真……真的。别……别……别犯傻。”吉尔说。她这样说话，是因为她被冻得牙齿一直打战。

一个树精立刻捡起某个急着去取采矿工具的矮人匆忙之间丢下的毛斗篷，裹在了吉尔身上，一个热心的半羊怪小跑着穿过树丛去给她找点儿热东西喝，吉尔可以看到他去的那个山洞口有火光。不过他还没回来，所有的矮人就都带着铁锹、鹤嘴锄回来了，直接扑向了山坡。然后，吉尔就听到了各种喊声：“嘿！你做什么呢？放下剑！”还有，“好啦，年轻人，别那样！”还有，“他是个坏人，是不是？”吉尔赶忙跑过去，看到了尤斯塔斯的脸，不知道是该笑还是该哭，尤斯塔斯脸色苍白，脏兮兮的，从黑暗的洞中探出来，右手挥着剑，只要有人靠近，他就刺过去。

当然，刚刚过去的几分钟里，尤斯塔斯和吉尔的感觉和经历完全不同。他听到了吉尔的叫声，看到她莫名其妙地消失了。与王子和普登格伦姆一样，他也认为是有敌人把她抓走了。而且，在那下面，他没有看出来那暗淡幽蓝的光实际上就是月光。他以为这个洞口是通向另一个洞窟的，那里闪着鬼火磷光，满是地下世界的妖魔鬼怪，老天才说得出他们到底是什么。于是，他说服了普登格伦姆支撑着他，他拔出剑，探出头，真的非常非常勇敢。另外两人如果可以的话，是会冲在前面的，不过那个洞太小了，他们爬不出来。尤斯塔斯的体形比吉尔要高一些，也臃肿很多，所以，当他向外看的时候，头撞到了洞顶，引来了一场小雪崩砸在他的脸上。因此，当他可以再看清楚的时候，只看到几十个人影以最快的速度扑了过来，所以，他自然而然地想要挡住他们。

“住手，尤斯塔斯，住手，”吉尔叫道，“他们全都是朋友。你没看出来吗？我们又回到纳尼亚了。一切都很好。”

然后，尤斯塔斯看明白了，便向矮人们道歉（矮人们都说不用提了），有几十双粗壮多毛的矮人的手帮他出了洞，就像刚才帮吉尔出来一样。然后，吉尔又爬上山坡，把头探入黑黑的洞口，将好消息大声告诉了下面被困的人。就在她离开时，她听到普登格伦姆低声咕哝：“唉，可怜的波尔。她肯定受不了了，最后这一刻。她的头晕了，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。她肯定产生了幻觉。”

吉尔和尤斯塔斯会合，他们都用双手握住彼此的手，然后深深地呼吸着自由的午夜的空气。一件暖和的斗篷披在了尤斯塔斯身上，热饮也给二人送了过来。他们喝着东西，矮人们已经将山麓上洞口周围原有的雪和草地都清理了一大片下来，然后鹤嘴锄和铁锹欢快地工作起来，就像十分钟前半羊怪和树精跳舞的脚步一样欢快。只有十分钟啊！不过，此时，吉尔和尤斯塔斯都开始感觉，他们在黑暗中经历的种种危险，在地下感受到的热度，以及窒息的感觉，肯定都是一场梦。站在这里，在冷冷的户外，月亮和硕大的星星挂在头顶（在纳尼亚，星星比在我们的世界离地面近些），周围都是和气快活的脸孔，真的不会相信地下世界的存在。

他们还没有喝完热腾腾的饮料，就已经有十多个鼹鼠赶了过来，他们刚被从睡梦中唤醒，依然睡意恹恹，不是太高兴。不过，他们一搞清楚是怎么回事，就自愿加入了其中。甚至半羊怪们也贡献了自己的力量，用小小的独轮车运走挖出来的泥土，而松鼠们激动地手舞足蹈，前后跳跃，只是吉尔一直都不清楚他们到底有没有想过自己在做什么。熊和猫头鹰很自得其乐地提供指导建议，还一直问孩子们是不是想去山洞里（就是吉尔看到火光的那个山洞）暖和一下，吃点儿东西。不过孩子们不愿意在看到朋友们获救之前离开。

在我们的世界中，没有人能从事纳尼亚的矮人和会说话的鼹鼠所从事的工作，不过，当然，鼹鼠和矮人没有将之视为工作。他们喜欢挖掘。因此，真的没用多长时间，他们就在山麓上开凿出了一个黑黝黝的大裂口。而首先从黑暗中进入月光之下的——如果不知道出来的人会是谁，这一幕真的非常吓人——是沼泽怪长着长腿头戴尖帽的修长身子，然后是牵着两匹大马的瑞利安王子。

普登格伦姆一出来，四面八方就传来了各种叫声：“哎呀，是个沼泽怪——哎呀，是老普登格伦姆——东部沼泽的老普登格伦姆——你到底干什么去了，普登格伦姆？——有好几个寻人队去找你了呢——杜鲁普金大人发布了通知，有悬赏呢！”但在一瞬间，这一切声音都戛然而止，一片死寂，就像是校长突然打开了闹腾腾的宿舍门时所有的声音都戛然而止一样。因为，此时，他们都看到了王子。

没有一个人对他的身份有过片刻的怀疑。有很多的走兽、树精、矮人和半羊怪都还记得中了魔法之前的他。有一些老人记得他父亲凯斯宾国王年轻时的样子，看到了他们的相似之处。但我觉得无论如何，他们都会认出他来。尽管因为被长时间囚禁在深域王国，他脸色苍白，身上穿着黑漆漆的衣服，满是尘埃，头发蓬乱，疲倦不堪，但他脸上和他气质中的某些东西，没有人会认错。那种表情，那种气质，会出现在纳尼亚所有真王的脸上，出现在所有因阿斯兰的旨意而统治王国，坐在至尊王彼得在凯尔帕拉维尔的王座上的人的脸上。一时之间，所有人都摘掉帽子，跪在了地上，过了一会儿，他们爆发出了欢呼呐喊，兴奋得手舞足蹈，载歌载舞，每个人都和身边的人握手亲吻拥抱，吉尔也热泪盈眶。无论经历了怎样的伤痛，付出了多大的代价，他们的寻找之旅都是值得的。

“殿下，请移步，”最老的一个矮人说，“那边的山洞中准备了一些晚餐，是准备在雪球舞结束之后吃的……”

“乐意之至，老爹，”王子说，“因为绝对不会有任何王子、骑士、绅士或者熊，能有今晚我们这四个流浪者这么好的胃口。”

大伙都开始穿过树林，朝山洞走去。吉尔听到普登格伦姆对簇拥在他身边的人说：“不，不，我的故事可以等会儿再说。发生在我身上的事情没什么值得说的。我想听听新闻。不要对我委婉隐瞒，我想一次性都知道。国王沉船了吗？森林失火了吗？卡罗门边境没有发生战事吗？还是出现了几条龙？我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。”所有人都一阵大笑，说：“沼泽怪不就是这样吗？”

两个孩子又累又饿，几乎快要瘫倒在地了，不过山洞里面暖融融的，一看到山洞，还有在壁炉中跳跃的火光，还有餐具柜和杯盘碗碟，还有光滑的石头地面，这一切都如同乡村农场的厨房一般，他们就精神了一些。不过，在准备晚餐的过程中，他们还是沉沉地睡着了。当他们醒来时，瑞利安王子正在向动物和矮人中的老者和智者们讲述整个冒险的经历。他们现在都明白了是怎么回事：那个邪恶的女巫（无疑和很久很久之前给纳尼亚带来了漫长冬季的白女巫是同一类）谋划了整件事情，先是杀死了瑞利安的母亲，然后又对瑞利安施了魔法。他们现在明白了她在纳尼亚地下挖掘，准备冲上来，然后通过瑞利安统治纳尼亚，明白了王子做梦都没有想到，女王要让他担任国王（名义上的国王，实际上是她的奴隶）的国家，就是他自己的祖国。从两个孩子讲述的部分，他们听明白了她和哈方的危险巨人狼狈为奸。

“殿下，这其中最重要的教训就是，”最老的矮人说，“那些北方的女巫一直都在图谋同样的东西，只是不同的时代，她们会使出不同的阴谋罢了。”





第十六章　治愈伤痛


第二天早上吉尔醒来时，发现自己身处一个山洞中，一时之间惊恐万分，以为自己又回到了地下世界。但当她注意到她躺在欧石南铺成的床上，身上盖着一件毛绒绒的披风，看到石头壁炉中欢快的噼啪作响的炉火（像是刚刚点燃的一般），以及再远一些的地方，从山洞口照射进来的朝阳的光辉，就想起了所有开心的现实。他们享用了一顿非常丰盛的晚餐，所有人都挤到了山洞中，不过晚宴还没有正式结束，她就觉得实在困倦不堪了。她模模糊糊记得矮人们凑在火堆周围，围着比他们自己还大的煎锅，记得滋滋的热油声，还有香肠的美味，以及还有更多、更多、更多的香肠。不是那种一半是面包和黄豆的劣质香肠，而是真正的肉做的味道浓郁的香肠，肉质肥美，煎得滚烫，已经裂开，微微有点儿焦。另外还有大杯的冒着泡的热巧克力，烤土豆，烤板栗，中间夹了葡萄干的去核烤苹果，在吃完热腾腾的东西之后，还有冰让你精神一振。

吉尔坐起身，打量四周。普登格伦姆和尤斯塔斯躺在离她不远的地方，都沉沉地睡着。

“嘿，你们俩！”吉尔大声喊，“你们还不准备起床吗？”

“嘘，嘘！”她头顶上方一个睡意恹恹的声音说，“该歇下了。好好睡一觉，睡吧，睡吧。别瞎闹腾。嘟——呜！”

“哎呀，我真的相信，”吉尔抬头看到在山洞一个角落栖息在一台落地大座钟的顶上的那一团毛绒绒的白色羽毛，“我真的相信那是闪亮羽毛。”

“正是，正是。”猫头鹰呼呼地叫了起来，他抬起藏在翅膀下的头，睁开一只眼睛，“我在两点左右给王子送了个信儿。是松鼠给我们带来的好消息，给王子的信。他走了，你们也要跟着去。再见……”然后他的脑袋又不见了。

看样子想从猫头鹰那里再得到任何信息是没有希望了，吉尔站起身，四处打量，想看看可不可以洗漱，有没有早饭吃。不过，立刻就有一个小半羊怪小跑着进了山洞，他的羊蹄子踩在石头地板上，嘎达嘎达的响声清脆。

“啊！你终于醒了，夏娃之女。”他说，“也许你最好唤醒亚当之子。你们一会儿就要出发了，有两个半人马非常好心地愿意让你们骑着他们去凯尔帕拉维尔。”他的声音降低了一些，补充道，“当然，你要明白，能够骑一个半人马，是非常特别的无上光荣。我觉得我过去没有听说过有谁做过这样的事情。所以不能让他们等着。”

“王子在哪里？”这是尤斯塔斯和普登格伦姆醒来后问的第一个问题。

“他已经去见国王了，也就是他父亲，就在凯尔帕拉维尔。”半羊怪回答，他的名字叫奥伦斯，“陛下的船随时都会回港。据说，国王遇到了阿斯兰——我不知道是看到了显灵，还是直接面对面——那时候他还没有航行到太远的地方，阿斯兰让他调转船头回来，告诉他，回到纳尼亚，他就会看到自己失踪已久的儿子正等着他。”

尤斯塔斯起来了，他和吉尔帮奥伦斯准备早饭。普登格伦姆按照吩咐待在床上。一个名叫云生的半人马是知名的医生，或者按照奥伦斯的说法，是个“郎中”，一会儿要过来给他检查烫伤的脚。

“哎呀！”普登格伦姆用一种几乎可以说是心满意足的声音说，“他肯定会把我的腿从膝盖截肢的，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。你就等着瞧他会不会吧。”不过他很开心能够待在床上。

早餐是炒鸡蛋和面包片，尤斯塔斯吃得风卷残云一般，就好像他昨天半夜没有吃那顿极其丰盛的晚餐一样。

“我说，亚当之子，”半羊怪惊叹地看着尤斯塔斯的嘴巴，“没有必要那么匆忙，吃得那么快。我觉得半人马这会儿还没有吃完早餐呢。”

“那他们肯定起得很晚，”尤斯塔斯说，“我打赌现在已经十点多了。”

“噢，不是，”奥伦斯说，“他们天没亮就起来了。”

“那他们肯定等了老长的时间才吃上早饭。”尤斯塔斯说。

“不，没有。”奥伦斯说，“他们一醒来就开始吃饭了。”

“天啊！”尤斯塔斯说，“他们吃了老大一份早饭吗？”

“哎呀，亚当之子，你不懂吗？半人马有一个人的胃，还有一个马的胃，两个胃都需要早餐啊。所以，他们会先喝粥，吃帕文德鱼、腰子、腌肉、鸡蛋饼、冷火腿、面包片、果酱，还要喝咖啡和啤酒。然后他再照顾马的那一部分，去牧场里吃上一个小时左右，最后再吃一些热麦麸、燕麦和一袋糖。因此，这就是为什么说请一个半人马来过周末是一件非常重大的事情。真的是非常重大的事情。”

就在这时，传来一阵马蹄踏在山洞口的岩石上的声音，孩子们都抬头望去。有两个半人马，其中一个长着黑胡须，另一个长着金色的胡须，胡须飘拂在他们赤裸的健美的胸膛前，他们就站在那里等着，稍微低着头往洞里观望。于是，孩子们变得礼貌了起来，非常迅速地吃完了早餐。任何人在看到半人马时都不会觉得好笑。他们是肃穆而庄重的人，满腹从星星那里学来的古代智慧，既不会轻易被逗笑，也不会轻易被激怒，不过，如果他们愤怒起来，那就会如同海啸一般可怕。

“再见，亲爱的普登格伦姆，”吉尔走到沼泽怪的床边，“很抱歉我们过去说你是个扫兴的人。”

“我也是。”尤斯塔斯说，“你是全世界最好的朋友。”

“我真的希望我们能有机会再见。”吉尔又说。

“没有太多机会了，我得说，”普登格伦姆说，“我估计我很可能再也见不到我的旧棚屋了。还有王子——他真是个和气的人——不过，你们认为他很强壮吗？地下世界的生活把他的体格毁了，我一点儿都不觉得奇怪。他看上去就像那种随时都可能完蛋的人。”

“普登格伦姆！”吉尔说，“你真是个一成不变的老骗子！你说的话就像葬礼一样阴郁，但我相信你极其快乐。你说得好像你什么都怕，但你其实勇敢得像头狮子。”

“好啦，说到葬礼……”普登格伦姆开口说，不过吉尔听到身后传来的半人马的蹄声，于是甩动胳膊，抱住了他瘦瘦的脖子，亲吻了他烂泥一般的脸，吓了他一大跳。一边的尤斯塔斯也握紧了他的手。然后，他们两个都急匆匆地离开，去找半人马了，而沼泽怪又坐回到床上，自言自语地说：“好吧，我真是做梦也想不到她会这么做。尽管我的确是个长得还不错的家伙。”

骑半人马无疑是极高的荣耀（除了吉尔和尤斯塔斯之外，今天这个世界活着的人中可能就没有别人做过这事了），但骑在上面也非常不舒服。因为，任何一个珍视自己生命的人，都会建议给半人马配个马鞍，没有马鞍真的一点儿都不好玩，特别是如果你像尤斯塔斯一样从来没有学过骑术。半人马很有教养，只是这种教养中流露着成年人的庄重谦和，他们小跑着穿过纳尼亚的树林时，向两个孩子讲了一些草药和植物根的特性，行星的影响力，阿斯兰的九个名字以及每个名字的意义，以及其他类似的事情，但始终都没有回一下头。不过，尽管两个人浑身酸痛，一路颠簸，但他们如今还是愿意付出一切代价重温这段旅行，去看那些林间空地和山坡在隔夜雪后闪闪发光，去和那些跟你道早安的兔子、松鼠和鸟儿相遇，去再次呼吸纳尼亚的空气，倾听纳尼亚树木的低语。

他们来到河边，流淌的河水在冬日的艳阳下泛着璀璨的蓝光，在最后一座桥下面（那座桥在温暖舒适的红屋顶的小镇伯鲁纳），他们搭了一条筏子，摆渡人将他们送过了河。确切地说，这个摆渡人该被称作摆渡沼泽怪，因为在纳尼亚，大多数与水和鱼有关的工作，都是由沼泽怪来做的。过了河之后，他们沿着河的南岸前行，很快就到了凯尔帕拉维尔城堡。他们刚到那里，就看到了他们刚刚踏足纳尼亚时看到的那条大船，它如同一只巨大的鸟一般，逆流而上。所有的廷臣又一次聚集在城堡和渡口之间的绿地上，欢迎凯斯宾国王归家。瑞利安已经换下黑衣，在银色锁子甲外面披了一件猩红色斗篷，没戴帽子或头盔，站在靠近水边的地方准备迎接他的父亲。矮人杜鲁普金就在他旁边，坐在驴拉着的椅子中。孩子们发现没有办法穿过人群去到王子身边了，不过，他们现在也很害羞。所以，他们问半人马，是否可以在他们背上多待一会儿，这样他们就能越过廷臣们的脑袋，看到发生的一切。半人马说他们可以。

一阵银色小号的奏鸣声从船的甲板上传出，回荡在水面上，水手们抛下绳索，老鼠们（当然是会说话的老鼠）和沼泽怪们将其系在岸上，这样船被拖进了港口。原本隐藏在人群中的乐手们奏响庄重的凯旋之音。很快，国王的帆船便横摆过船身，老鼠们顺着跳板跑到了船上。

吉尔期待能看到老国王从船上下来。不过，那边似乎是有了麻烦。一个脸色苍白的大臣上岸，跪在王子和杜鲁普金面前。然后三个人把脑袋凑在一起，窃窃私语了好一会儿，但没人能听到他们说了什么。音乐还在演奏，但你能感觉到每个人都不安起来。然后，四个骑士抬着什么东西，迈着非常缓慢的步子，出现在了甲板上。当他们顺着跳板走下船时，就能看清楚他们抬的是什么了，是躺在床上的老国王，脸色苍白，一动不动。他们将他放下。王子跪在老国王身边，拥抱他。他们都能看到凯斯宾国王举起手，给儿子送上了祝福。大家欢呼了一下，不过却有些心不在焉，因为他们都预感要出事了。然后，突然之间，国王的头倒在了枕头上，乐师们停止了演奏，一片死寂笼罩下来。王子跪在国王的床边，把头伏在床上，开始哭泣。

前前后后各个方向都传来了窃窃私语声。这时，吉尔注意到，所有的帽子、头盔或兜帽都被摘掉了——尤斯塔斯也摘掉了帽子。然后她听到从高处的城堡那边传来了一阵刷刷飒飒的声音，她望过去，看到绘有金色狮子的大旗被降半旗。然后，哀泣的弦乐和惆怅的号角残忍地缓缓响起，音乐又开始演奏，只是这一次演奏的是一种令人心碎的曲调。

他们两个都从半人马身上下来了（半人马都没有注意到）。

“我真希望自己待在家里面。”吉尔说。

尤斯塔斯点了点头，什么都没有说，只是咬住了自己的嘴唇。

“我来了。”他们身后传来一个低沉的声音。他们转头望去，看到了狮子，鲜活，真实，强壮，和他一比，一切都黯然失色。还不到转瞬的工夫，吉尔就忘记了死去的纳尼亚国王，心里想的只有她害得尤斯塔斯跌落悬崖，她几乎错过了所有的提示，以及一路上的拌嘴和争吵。她想说一句“对不起”，却开不了口。然后狮子用眼神将他们招到身边，低下头，用舌头舔了舔他们苍白的脸，说：“别再想那些了。我永远都不会训斥人。你们已经完成了我送你们来纳尼亚需要完成的使命。”

“请问，阿斯兰，”吉尔说，“我们现在能回家吗？”

“是的。我来带你们回家。”阿斯兰说。然后他张大嘴巴，吹了一口气。不过这一次，他们并没有觉得自己飞到了空中，而是相反，他们似乎留在原地没动，阿斯兰猛烈的呼气将船只、死去的国王、城堡、雪和冬季的天空都给吹走了。这些东西都化作云烟，飘散在了空中，而突然之间，他们就站在了灿烂耀眼的仲夏阳光下，站在柔软的草地上，站在巨大的树木间，旁边是一道清澈鲜活的小溪。这时，他们看到自己又一次来到了阿斯兰大山，高高耸立在纳尼亚那个世界的尽头之上和之外。奇怪的是，凯斯宾国王的哀乐还在演奏着，尽管没有人能说出声音是从哪里传来的。他们沿着小溪而行，狮子走在他们前面：狮子是如此美丽，而音乐又是如此绝望，吉尔真不知道自己到底是因为哪一点，眼眶中涌满了泪水。

然后，阿斯兰停下了脚步，孩子们向溪水望去。在水中，在河床的金色沙砾中，躺着凯斯宾国王，他已经死去，溪水从他身体上方流过，仿佛液体的玻璃。他长长的白胡须仿佛水草一般，在水中摇摆。他们三个都站在水边默默地流泪。甚至是狮子也在流泪，伟大的狮子的眼泪，若他的每滴眼泪是一颗钻石，那一颗就要比尘世间的一切都珍贵。吉尔注意到，尤斯塔斯既不像个小孩子一样哭，也不像个男孩子一样想要掩饰自己的哭泣，而是像个大人一样流泪。至少，这是她认为最符合实际的描述方式了，不过，实际上，如她自己所说，在那座山上，人们似乎没有特定的年龄。

“亚当之子，”阿斯兰说，“到那丛灌木里，找一根荆棘折下来，拿来给我。”

尤斯塔斯听命行事。那根荆棘有一英尺长，尖得像一柄轻剑。

“把它刺进我的爪子里，亚当之子。”阿斯兰说着，举起了右前爪，将爪子的大肉垫展现在尤斯塔斯面前。

“我必须这么做吗？”尤斯塔斯问。

“是的。”阿斯兰说。

然后，尤斯塔斯咬紧牙关，将荆棘刺入了狮子的爪垫。从那里流出一大滴血，红红的，比你见过或是能想象到的所有红色都要红。鲜血滴入溪水中，落在国王的尸体上方。与此同时，哀乐停止了。死去的国王开始变化。他白色的胡须变成了灰色，又从灰色变成了黄色，而且越来越短，最后彻底消失不见。他深陷的脸颊又变得圆润饱满，容光焕发，皱纹都变平了，他的眼睛睁开，眼睛和嘴唇都透着笑意，突然之间，他一跃而起，站在了他们面前——他是一个非常年轻的男人，或者应该说是一个男孩。（但是吉尔说不清楚到底是哪个，因为在阿斯兰的国度，人们没有特定的年纪。哪怕在我们这个世界中，最笨的孩子往往都是最孩子气的，最蠢的成人也往往都是最成人气的。）他飞奔到阿斯兰面前，挥动手臂，用力搂住他的脖子，他给阿斯兰献上了国王有力的亲吻，阿斯兰也给了他狮子狂野的亲吻。

最后，凯斯宾转向两个孩子。他发出一阵惊喜的大笑声。

“啊！尤斯塔斯！”他说，“尤斯塔斯！所以，你最终到达了世界尽头。我那把被你在海蛇身上砍断的第二好的宝剑怎么样了？”

尤斯塔斯向他走近一步，探出双手，不过立刻又带着震惊的表情抽了回来。

“听着！我说，”他结结巴巴地说，“那把剑很好。但你不是……？我是说你没有……？”

“哦，别傻了。”凯斯宾说。

“不过，”尤斯塔斯看着阿斯兰，“他没有——呃，没死吗？”

“死了。”狮子用非常平静的声音回答，（吉尔觉得）他似乎是在笑，“他已经死了。大多数人都死过，你知道的。甚至我也死过。只有很少数的人没死过。”

“啊，”凯斯宾说，“我明白你的困扰是什么了。你觉得我是个鬼魂，或者是个解释不清的妖怪。但你不明白吗？如果我现在出现在纳尼亚，的确会是那样，因为我已经不再属于那里了。人不会在属于他的国度做鬼。如果我进入你的世界，我就是个鬼魂。我也不知道。但我觉得，那里也不是你们的世界了，你们来到了这里。”

孩子们心中升起了巨大的期望。但阿斯兰摇了摇他长毛蓬松的头。“不，亲爱的，”他说，“当有一天你们再在这里和我重逢，那将是你们留下来的时刻。不过不是现在。你们必须暂时返回你们自己的世界中去。”

“阁下，”凯斯宾说，“我一直都想看一眼他们的世界。那有问题吗？”

“你所想的东西都不再有问题，你已经死了，我的孩子。”阿斯兰说，“你会看到他们的世界——按他们的时间计算，五分钟。对你来说，把那儿的事情纠正过来，不需要更多的时间。”然后阿斯兰向凯斯宾解释了吉尔和尤斯塔斯回到的世界是什么样子的，解释了关于实验学校的一切，他就像两个孩子一样了解那里。

“女儿，”阿斯兰对吉尔说，“从灌木中拔一根软枝来。”她听命行事，软枝一到她手里，就变成了一根崭新的优良的马鞭。

“好的，亚当之子们，拔出你们的剑，”阿斯兰说，“但只能用剑背，因为我要送你们去对抗的，都只是胆小鬼和孩子，不是战士。”

“你会和我们一起吗，阿斯兰？”吉尔说。

“他们只会看到我的背。”阿斯兰说。

他领着他们快速穿过树林，没走太远，实验学校的墙就出现在了他们面前。这时，阿斯兰一声咆哮，天空中的太阳颤抖了一下，他们面前的墙塌掉了三十英尺。他们透过缺口望向里面，目光顺着校园内的灌木丛而下，一直到体育馆的屋顶上，一切都还在他们冒险开始前所见到的阴沉的秋日天空之下。阿斯兰转身看着吉尔和尤斯塔斯，呼吸喷在他们身上，他用舌头舔了舔他们的前额。然后他躺在自己在墙上震出的缺口处，把金色的背部朝向英国，庄严的脸朝着他自己的土地。而就在此时，吉尔看到了那些她已经太过熟悉的身影，正穿过月桂树丛扑向了他们。

那个团伙的大多数人都在这里，阿黛拉·彭尼法瑟，霍尔蒙德利·梅杰，伊迪斯·温特博罗特，“斑点”索里尔，大巴尼斯特，还有讨厌的加莱特双胞胎。但他们突然间都停下了脚步。他们的脸色都变了，原有的刻薄、自负、残酷、鬼祟，几乎都消失了，只剩下了一种表情：恐惧。因为他们看到了倒塌的墙，一头像小象一样大的狮子躺在缺口处，三个衣着华丽、手持武器的人影正向他们冲来。他们身上充满了阿斯兰的力量，吉尔将软鞭挥向了女孩们，而凯斯宾和尤斯塔斯则将剑背砸在了男孩身上，不到两分钟，所有的霸凌者都疯了一般地四散奔逃，嘴里叫嚷着：“凶手！法西斯！狮子！这不公平！”然后，校长（顺便说一句，是个女的）赶来查看到底出了什么事。当她看到狮子、坍塌的墙以及凯斯宾、吉尔和尤斯塔斯（她完全没有认出他们来）时，她歇斯底里地跑回教学楼，给警察打电话，报告说有狮子从马戏团里跑了出来，还有越狱的逃犯携带着出鞘的剑毁坏了校园的墙壁。在这一片混乱之中，吉尔和尤斯塔斯悄悄地溜回了屋里，脱下了身上亮丽的衣服，换上了普通的衣服，凯斯宾则回到了自己的世界中。而那堵墙，在阿斯兰的旨意下恢复得完整如初。警察赶来时并没有发现狮子和坍塌的墙，也没有发现逃犯，而校长表现得就像个疯子一般，于是他们开始调查整个事件的来龙去脉。在调查过程中，关于实验学校的各种事情都浮上了水面，大约有十个人被开除了。在这之后，校长的朋友们发现校长已经不能再担任校长这个职务了，于是便安排她当了督学，去监督其他校长。然后，他们发现她也不太擅长做那个工作，于是就把她送进了国会，她在那里一直过得很开心。

一个晚上，尤斯塔斯将他精美的衣服悄悄地埋在了校园里，而吉尔则偷偷地把衣服带回了家中，在之后假期的化装舞会上穿上了那些衣服。从那天开始，实验学校中的一切都开始变好，那里变成了一所很好的学校。而吉尔和尤斯塔斯成了永远的朋友。

而在遥远的纳尼亚，瑞利安国王埋葬了他的父亲——航海者凯斯宾十世，并深深地哀悼他。瑞利安将纳尼亚治理得很好，在他统治的时代，那里是一片乐土，不过普登格伦姆（他的脚三个星期就康复如新）经常说，晴朗的早晨会变成湿漉漉的下午，你不能期望好日子能永久。那座山上的洞口依然留着，在炎热的夏日，经常有纳尼亚人带着船只和灯笼进去，到下面的水中，在凉爽黑暗的地下海洋上游船，唱歌，讲述几千英寻的地下的城市的其他故事。如果你有幸能亲自到纳尼亚去，不要忘了去看一眼那些洞窟。





CHAPTER ONE: BEHIND THE GYM


IT was a dull autumn day and Jill Pole was crying behind the gym.

She was crying because they had been bullying her. This is not going to be a school story, so I shall say as little as possible about Jill's school, which is not a pleasant subject. It was Co-educational, a school for both boys and girls, what used to be called a “mixed” school; some said it was not nearly so mixed as the minds of the people who ran it. These people had the idea that boys and girls should be allowed to do what they liked. And unfortunately what ten or fifteen of the biggest boys and girls liked best was bullying the others. All sorts of things, horrid things, went on which at an ordinary school would have been found out and stopped in half a term; but at this school they weren't. Or even if they were, the people who did them were not expelled or punished. The Head said they were interesting psychological cases and sent for them and talked to them for hours. And if you knew the right sort of things to say to the Head, the main result was that you became rather a favourite than otherwise.

That was why Jill Pole was crying on that dull autumn day on the damp little path which runs between the back of the gym and the shrubbery. And she hadn't nearly finished her cry when a boy came round the corner of the gym whistling, with his hands in his pockets. He nearly ran into her.

“Can't you look where you're going?” said Jill Pole.

“All right,” said the boy, “you needn't start—” and then he noticed her face. “I say, Pole,” he said, “what's up?”

Jill only made faces; the sort you make when you're trying to say something but find that if you speak you'll start crying again.

“It's Them, I suppose—as usual,” said the boy grimly, digging his hands further into his pockets.

Jill nodded. There was no need for her to say anything, even if she could have said it. They both knew.

“Now, look here,” said the boy, “there's no good us all—”

He meant well, but he did talk rather like someone beginning a lecture. Jill suddenly flew into a temper (which is quite a likely thing to happen if you have been interrupted in a cry).

“Oh, go away and mind your own business,” she said. “Nobody asked you to come barging in, did they? And you're a nice person to start telling us what we all ought to do, aren't you? I suppose you mean we ought to spend all our time sucking up to Them, and currying favour, and dancing attendance on Them like you do.”

“Oh, Lor!” said the boy, sitting down on the grassy bank at the edge of the shrubbery and very quickly getting up again because the grass was soaking wet. His name unfortunately was Eustace Scrubb, but he wasn't a bad sort.

“Pole!” he said. “Is that fair? Have I been doing anything of the sort this term? Didn't I stand up to Carter about the rabbit? And didn't I keep the secret about Spivvins—under torture too? And didn't I—”

“I d-don't know and I don't care,” sobbed Jill.

Scrubb saw that she wasn't quite herself yet and very sensibly offered her a peppermint. He had one too. Presently Jill began to see things in a clearer light.

“I'm sorry, Scrubb,” she said presently. “I wasn't fair. You have done all that—this term.”

“Then wash out last term if you can,” said Eustace. “I was a different chap then. I was—gosh! what a little tick I was.”

“Well, honestly, you were,” said Jill.

“You think there has been a change, then?” said Eustace.

“It's not only me,” said Jill. “Everyone's been saying so. They've noticed it. Eleanor Blakiston heard Adela Pennyfather talking about it in our changing room yesterday. She said, ‘Someone's got hold of that Scrubb kid. He's quite unmanageable this term. We shall have to attend to him next.’”

Eustace gave a shudder. Everyone at Experiment House knew what it was like being “attended to” by Them.

Both children were quiet for a moment. The drops dripped off the laurel leaves.

“Why were you so different last term?” said Jill presently.

“A lot of queer things happened to me in the hols,” said Eustace mysteriously.

“What sort of things?” asked Jill.

Eustace didn't say anything for quite a long time. Then he said: “Look here, Pole, you and I hate this place about as much as anybody can hate anything, don't we?”

“I know I do,” said Jill.

“Then I really think I can trust you.”

“Dam' good of you,” said Jill.

“Yes, but this is a really terrific secret. Pole, I say, are you good at believing things? I mean things that everyone here would laugh at?”

“I've never had the chance,” said Jill, “but I think I would be.”

“Could you believe me if I said I'd been right out of the world—outside this world—last hols?”

“I wouldn't know what you meant.”

“Well, don't let's bother about that then. Supposing I told you I'd been in a place where animals can talk and where there are—er—enchantments and dragons—and—well, all the sorts of things you have in fairy tales.” Scrubb felt terribly awkward as he said this and got red in the face.

“How did you get there?” said Jill. She also felt curiously shy.

“The only way you can—by Magic,” said Eustace almost in a whisper. “I was with two cousins of mine. We were just—whisked away. They'd been there before.”

Now that they were talking in whispers Jill somehow felt it easier to believe. Then suddenly a horrible suspicion came over her and she said (so fiercely that for the moment she looked like a tigress):

“If I find you've been pulling my leg I'll never speak to you again; never, never, never.”

“I'm not,” said Eustace. “I swear I'm not. I swear by—by everything.”

(When I was at school one would have said, “I swear by the Bible.” But Bibles were not encouraged at Experiment House.)

“All right,” said Jill, “I'll believe you.”

“And tell nobody?”

“What do you take me for?”

They were very excited as they said this. But when they had said it and Jill looked round and saw the dull autumn sky and heard the drip off the leaves and thought of all the hopelessness of Experiment House (it was a thirteen-week term and there were still eleven weeks to come) she said:

“But after all, what's the good? We're not there: we're here. And we jolly well can't get there. Or can we?”

“That's what I've been wondering,” said Eustace. “When we came back from That Place, Someone said that the two Pevensie kids (that's my two cousins) could never go there again. It was their third time, you see. I suppose they've had their share. But he never said I couldn't. Surely he would have said so, unless he meant that I was to get back? And I can't help wondering, can we—could we—?”

“Do you mean, do something to make it happen?”

Eustace nodded.

“You mean we might draw a circle on the ground—and write in queer letters in it—and stand inside it—and recite charms and spells?”

“Well,” said Eustace after he had thought hard for a bit. “I believe that was the sort of thing I was thinking of, though I never did it. But now that it comes to the point, I've an idea that all those circles and things are rather rot. I don't think he'd like them. It would look as if we thought we could make him do things. But really, we can only ask him.”

“Who is this person you keep on talking about?”

“They call him Aslan in That Place,” said Eustace.

“What a curious name!”

“Not half so curious as himself,” said Eustace solemnly. “But let's get on. It can't do any harm, just asking. Let's stand side by side, like this. And we'll hold out our arms in front of us with the palms down: like they did in Ramandu's island—”

“Whose island?”

“I'll tell you about that another time. And he might like us to face the east. Let's see, where is the east?”

“I don't know,” said Jill.

“It's an extraordinary thing about girls that they never know the points of the compass,” said Eustace.

“You don't know either,” said Jill indignantly.

“Yes I do, if only you didn't keep on interrupting. I've got it now. That's the east, facing up into the laurels. Now, will you say the words after me?”

“What words?” asked Jill.

“The words I'm going to say, of course,” answered Eustace. “Now—”

And he began, “Aslan, Aslan, Aslan!”

“Aslan, Aslan, Aslan,” repeated Jill.

“Please let us two go into—”

At that moment a voice from the other side of the gym was heard shouting out, “Pole? Yes. I know where she is. She's blubbing behind the gym. Shall I fetch her out?”

Jill and Eustace gave one glance at each other, dived under the laurels, and began scrambling up the steep, earthy slope of the shrubbery at a speed which did them great credit. (Owing to the curious methods of teaching at Experiment House, one did not learn much French or Maths or Latin or things of that sort; but one did learn a lot about getting away quickly and quietly when They were looking for one.)

After about a minute's scramble they stopped to listen, and knew by the noises they heard that they were being followed.

“If only the door was open again!” said Scrubb as they went on, and Jill nodded. For at the top of the shrubbery was a high stone wall and in that wall a door by which you could get out on to open moor. This door was nearly always locked. But there had been times when people had found it open; or perhaps there had been only one time. But you may imagine how the memory of even one time kept people hoping, and trying the door; for if it should happen to be unlocked it would be a splendid way of getting outside the school grounds without being seen.

Jill and Eustace, now both very hot and very grubby from going along bent almost double under the laurels, panted up to the wall. And there was the door, shut as usual.

“It's sure to be no good,” said Eustace with his hand on the handle; and then, “O-o-oh. By Gum!!” For the handle turned and the door opened.

A moment before, both of them had meant to get through that doorway in double quick time, if by any chance the door was not locked. But when the door actually opened, they both stood stock still. For what they saw was quite different from what they had expected.

They had expected to see the grey, heathery slope of the moor going up and up to join the dull autumn sky. Instead, a blaze of sunshine met them. It poured through the doorway as the light of a June day pours into a garage when you open the door. It made the drops of water on the grass glitter like beads and showed up the dirtiness of Jill's tear-stained face. And the sunlight was coming from what certainly did look like a different world—what they could see of it. They saw smooth turf, smoother and brighter than Jill had ever seen before, and blue sky, and, darting to and fro, things so bright that they might have been jewels or huge butterflies.

Although she had been longing for something like this, Jill felt frightened. She looked at Scrubb's face and saw that he was frightened too.

“Come on, Pole,” he said in a breathless voice.

“Can we get back? Is it safe?” asked Jill.

At that moment a voice shouted from behind, a mean, spiteful little voice. “Now then, Pole,” it squeaked. “Everyone knows you're there. Down you come.” It was the voice of Edith Jackle, not one of Them herself but one of their hangers-on and tale-bearers.

“Quick!” said Scrubb. “Here. Hold hands. We mustn't get separated.” And before she quite knew what was happening, he had grabbed her hand and pulled her through the door, out of the school grounds, out of England, out of our whole world into That Place.

The sound of Edith Jackle's voice stopped as suddenly as the voice on the radio when it is switched off. Instantly there was a quite different sound all about them. It came from those bright things overhead, which now turned out to be birds. They were making a riotous noise, but it was much more like music—rather advanced music which you don't quite take in at the first hearing—than birds' songs ever are in our world. Yet, in spite of the singing, there was a sort of background of immense silence. That silence, combined with the freshness of the air, made Jill think they must be on the top of a very high mountain.

Scrubb still had her by the hand and they were walking forward, staring about them on every side. Jill saw that huge trees, rather like cedars but bigger, grew in every direction. But as they did not grow close together, and as there was no under-growth, this did not prevent one from seeing a long way into the forest to left and right. And as far as Jill's eye could reach, it was all the same—level turf, darting birds with yellow, or dragonfly blue, or rainbow plumage, blue shadows, and emptiness. There was not a breath of wind in that cool, bright air. It was a very lonely forest.

Right ahead there were no trees: only blue sky. They went straight on without speaking till suddenly Jill heard Scrubb say, “Look out!” and felt herself jerked back. They were at the very edge of a cliff.

Jill was one of those lucky people who have a good head for heights. She didn't mind in the least standing on the edge of a precipice. She was rather annoyed with Scrubb for pulling her back—“just as if I was a kid,” she said—and she wrenched her hand out of his. When she saw how very white he had turned, she despised him.

“What's the matter?” she said. And to show that she was not afraid, she stood very near the edge indeed; in fact, a good deal nearer than even she liked. Then she looked down.

She now realized that Scrubb had some excuse for looking white, for no cliff in our world is to be compared with this. Imagine yourself at the top of the very highest cliff you know. And imagine yourself looking down to the very bottom. And then imagine that the precipice goes on below that, as far again, ten times as far, twenty times as far. And when you've looked down all that distance imagine little white things that might, at first glance, be mistaken for sheep, but presently you realize that they are clouds—not little wreaths of mist but the enormous white, puffy clouds which are themselves as big as most mountains. And at last, in between those clouds, you get your first glimpse of the real bottom, so far away that you can't make out whether it's field or wood, or land or water: further below those clouds than you are above them.

Jill stared at it. Then she thought that perhaps, after all, she would step back afoot or so from the edge; but she didn't like to for fear of what Scrubb would think. Then she suddenly decided that she didn't care what he thought, and that she would jolly well get away from that horrible edge and never laugh at anyone for not liking heights again. But when she tried to move, she found she couldn't. Her legs seemed to have turned into putty. Everything was swimming before her eyes.

“What are you doing, Pole? Come back—blithering little idiot!” shouted Scrubb. But his voice seemed to he coming from a long way off. She felt him grabbing at her. But by now she had no control over her own arms and legs. There was a moment's struggling on the cliff edge. Jill was too frightened and dizzy to know quite what she was doing, but two things she remembered as long as she lived (they often came back to her in dreams). One was that she had wrenched herself free of Scrubb's clutches; the other was that, at the same moment, Eustace himself, with a terrified scream, had lost his balance and gone hurtling to the depths.

Fortunately, she was given no time to think over what she had done. Some huge, brightly-coloured animal had rushed to the edge of the cliff. It was lying down, leaning over, and (this was the odd thing) blowing. Not roaring or snorting, but just blowing from its wideopened mouth; blowing out as steadily as a vacuum cleaner sucks in. Jill was lying so close to the creature that she could feel the breath vibrating steadily through its body. She was lying still because she couldn't get up. She was nearly fainting: indeed, she wished she could really faint, but faints don't come for the asking. At last she saw, far away below her, a tiny black speck floating away from the cliff and slightly upwards. As it rose, it also got further away. By the time it was nearly on a level with the cliff-top it was so far off that she lost sight of it. It was obviously moving away from them at a great speed. Jill couldn't help thinking that the creature at her side was blowing it away.

So she turned and looked at the creature. It was a lion.





CHAPTER TWO: JILL IS GIVEN A TASK


WITHOUT a glance at Jill, the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.

“It must be a dream, it must, it must,” said Jill to herself. “I'll wake up in a moment.” But it wasn't, and she didn't.

“I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place,” said Jill. “I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right.” Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.

Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small, persistent sound, which seemed to come from a good distance away. She listened carefully, and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.

Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tiptoes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.

The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.

It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.

“If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment,” thought Jill. “And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth.” Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.

“If you're thirsty, you may drink.”

They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, “If you are thirsty, come and drink,” and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realized that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.

“Are you not thirsty?” said the Lion.

“I'm dying of thirst,” said Jill.

“Then drink,” said the Lion.

“May I—could I—would you mind going away while I do?” said Jill.

The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realized that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.

The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.

“Will you promise not to—do anything to me, if I do come?” said Jill.

“I make no promise,” said the Lion.

Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.

“Do you eat girls?” she said.

“I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms,” said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.

“I daren't come and drink,” said Jill.

“Then you will die of thirst,” said the Lion.

“Oh dear!” said Jill, coming another step nearer. “I suppose I must go and look for another stream then.”

“There is no other stream,” said the Lion.

It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realized that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.

“Come here,” said the Lion. And she had to. She was almost between its front paws now, looking straight into its face. But she couldn't stand that for long; she dropped her eyes.

“Human Child,” said the Lion. “Where is the Boy?”

“He fell over the cliff,” said Jill, and added, “Sir.” She didn't know what else to call him, and it sounded cheek to call him nothing.

“How did he come to do that, Human Child?”

“He was trying to stop me from falling, Sir.”

“Why were you so near the edge, Human Child?”

“I was showing off, Sir.”

“That is a very good answer, Human Child. Do so no more. And now,” (here for the first time the Lion's face became a little less stern) “the Boy is safe. I have blown him to Narnia. But your task will be the harder because of what you have done.”

“Please, what task, Sir?” said Jill.

“The task for which I called you and him here out of your own world.”

This puzzled Jill very much. “It's mistaking me for someone else,” she thought. She didn't dare to tell the Lion this, though she felt things would get into a dreadful muddle unless she did.

“Speak your thought, Human Child,” said the Lion.

“I was wondering—I mean—could there be some mistake? Because nobody called me and Scrubb, you know. It was we who asked to come here. Scrubb said we were to call to—to Somebody—it was a name I wouldn't know—and perhaps the Somebody would let us in. And we did, and then we found the door open.”

“You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you,” said the Lion.

“Then you are Somebody, Sir?” said Jill.

“I am. And now hear your task. Far from here in the land of Narnia there lives an aged king who is sad because he has no prince of his blood to be king after him. He has no heir because his only son was stolen from him many years ago, and no one in Narnia knows where that Prince went or whether he is still alive. But he is. I lay on you this command, that you seek this lost prince until either you have found him and brought him to his father's house, or else died in the attempt, or else gone back into your own world.”

“How, please?” said Jill.

“I will tell you, Child,” said the Lion. “These are the signs by which I will guide you in your quest. First; as soon as the Boy Eustace sets foot in Narnia, he will meet an old and dear friend. He must greet that friend at once; if he does, you will both have good help. Second; you must journey out of Narnia to the north till you come to the ruined city of the ancient giants. Third; you shall find a writing on a stone in that ruined city, and you must do what the writing tells you. Fourth; you will know the lost prince (if you find him) by this, that he will be the first person you have met in your travels who will ask you to do something in my name, in the name of Aslan.”

As the Lion seemed to have finished, Jill thought she should say something. So she said, “Thank you very much. I see.”

“Child,” said Aslan, in a gentler voice than he had yet used, “perhaps you do not see quite as well as you think. But the first step is to remember. Repeat to me, in order, the four signs.”

Jill tried, and didn't get them quite right. So the Lion corrected her, and made her repeat them again and again till she could say them perfectly. He was very patient over this, so that, when it was done, Jill plucked up courage to ask:

“Please, how am I to get to Narnia?”

“On my breath,” said the Lion. “I will blow you into the west of the world as I blew Eustace.”

“Shall I catch him in time to tell him the first sign? But I suppose it won't matter. If he sees an old friend, he's sure to go and speak to him, isn't he?”

“You will have no time to spare,” said the Lion. “That is why I must send you at once. Come. Walk before me to the edge of the cliff.”

Jill remembered very well that if there was no time to spare, that was her own fault. “If I hadn't made such a fool of myself, Scrubb and I would have been going together. And he'd have heard all the instructions as well as me,” she thought. So she did as she was told. It was very alarming walking back to the edge of the cliff, especially as the Lion did not walk with her but behind her—making no noise on his soft paws.

But long before she had got anywhere near the edge, the voice behind her said, “Stand still. In a moment I will blow. But, first, remember, remember, remember the signs. Say them to yourself when you wake in the morning and when you lie down at night, and when you wake in the middle of the night. And whatever strange things may happen to you, let nothing turn your mind from following the signs. And secondly, I give you a warning. Here on the mountain I have spoken to you clearly: I will not often do so down in Narnia. Here on the mountain, the air is clear and your mind is clear; as you drop down into Narnia, the air will thicken. Take great care that it does not confuse your mind. And the signs which you have learned here will not look at all as you expect them to look, when you meet them there. That is why it is so important to know them by heart and pay no attention to appearances. Remember the signs and believe the signs. Nothing else matters. And now, daughter of Eve, farewell—”

The voice had been growing softer towards the end of this speech and now it faded away altogether. Jill looked behind her. To her astonishment she saw the cliff already more than a hundred yards behind her, and the Lion himself a speck of bright gold on the edge of it. She had been setting her teeth and clenching her fists for a terrible blast of lion's breath; but the breath had really been so gentle that she had not even noticed the moment at which she left the earth. And now, there was nothing but air for thousands upon thousands of feet below her.

She felt frightened only for a second. For one thing, the world beneath her was so very far away that it seemed to have nothing to do with her. For another, floating on the breath of the Lion was so extremely comfortable. She found she could lie on her back or on her face and twist any way she pleased, just as you can in water (if you've learned to float really well). And because she was moving at the same pace as the breath, there was no wind, and the air seemed beautifully warm. It was not in the least like being in an aeroplane, because there was no noise and no vibration. If Jill had ever been in a balloon she might have thought it more like that; only better.

When she looked back now she could take in for the first time the real size of the mountain she was leaving. She wondered why a mountain so huge as that was not covered with snow and ice—“but I suppose all that sort of thing is different in this world,” thought Jill. Then she looked below her; but she was so high that she couldn't make out whether she was floating over land or sea, nor what speed she was going at.

“By Jove! The signs!” said Jill suddenly. “I'd better repeat them.” She was in a panic for a second or two, but she found she could still say them all correctly. “So that's all right,” she said, and lay back on the air as if it was a sofa, with a sigh of contentment.

“Well, I do declare,” said Jill to herself some hours later, “I've been asleep. Fancy sleeping on air. I wonder if anyone's done it before. I don't suppose they have. Oh, bother—Scrubb probably has! On this same journey, a little bit before me. Let's see what it looks like down below.”

What it looked like was an enormous, very dark blue plain. There were no hills to be seen, but there were biggish white things moving slowly across it. “Those must be clouds,” she thought. “But far bigger than the ones we saw from the cliff. I suppose they're bigger because they're nearer. I must be getting lower. Bother this sun.”

The sun which had been high overhead when she began her journey was now getting into her eyes. This meant that it was getting lower, ahead of her. Scrubb was quite right in saying that Jill (I don't know about girls in general) didn't think much about points of the compass. Otherwise she would have known, when the sun began getting in her eyes, that she was travelling pretty nearly due west.

Staring at the blue plain below her, she presently noticed that there were little dots of brighter, paler colour in it here and there. “It's the sea!” thought Jill. “I do believe those are islands.” And so they were. She might have felt rather jealous if she had known that some of them were islands which Scrubb had seen from a ship's deck and even landed on; but she didn't know this. Then, later on, she began to see that there were little wrinkles on the blue flatness: little wrinkles which must be quite big ocean waves if you were down among them. And now, all along the horizon there was a thick dark line which grew thicker and darker so quickly that you could see it growing. That was the first sign she had had of the great speed at which she was travelling. And she knew that the thickening line must be land.

Suddenly from her left (for the wind was in the south) a great white cloud came rushing towards her, this time on the same level as herself. And before she knew where she was, she had shot right into the middle of its cold, wet fogginess. That took her breath away, but she was in it only for a moment. She came out blinking in the sunlight and found her clothes wet. (She had on a blazer and sweater and shorts and stockings and pretty thick shoes; it had been a muddy sort of day in England.) She came out lower than she had gone in; and as soon as she did so she noticed something which, I suppose, she ought to have been expecting, but which came as a surprise and a shock. It was Noises. Up till then she had travelled in total silence. Now, for the first time, she heard the noise of waves and the crying of seagulls. And now, too, she smelled the smell of the sea. There was no mistake about her speed now. She saw two waves meet with a smack and a spout of foam go up between them; but she had hardly seen it before it was a hundred yards behind her.

The land was getting nearer at a great pace. She could see mountains far inland, and other nearer mountains on her left. She could see bays and headlands, woods and fields, stretches of sandy beach. The sound of waves breaking on the shore was growing louder every second and drowning the other sea noises.

Suddenly the land opened right ahead of her. She was coming to the mouth of a river. She was very low now, only a few feet above the water. A wave-top came against her toe and a great splash of foam spurted up, drenching her nearly to the waist. Now she was losing speed. Instead of being carried up the river she was gliding in to the river bank on her left. There were so many things to notice that she could hardly take them all in; a smooth, green lawn, a ship so brightly coloured that it looked like an enormous piece of jewellery, towers and battlements, banners fluttering in the air, a crowd, gay clothes, armour, gold, swords, a sound of music. But this was all jumbled. The first thing that she knew clearly was that she had alighted and was standing under a thicket of trees close by the river side, and there, only a few feet away from her, was Scrubb.

The first thing she thought was how very grubby and untidy and generally unimpressive he looked. And the second was “How wet I am!”





CHAPTER THREE: THE SAILING OF THE KING


WHAT made Scrubb look so dingy (and Jill too, if she could only have seen herself) was the splendour of their surroundings. I had better describe them at once.

Through a cleft in those mountains which Jill had seen far inland as she approached the land, the sunset light was pouring over a level lawn. On the far side of the lawn, its weather-vanes glittering in the light, rose a many-towered and many-turreted castle; the most beautiful castle Jill had ever seen. On the near side was a quay of white marble and, moored to this, the ship: a tall ship with high forecastle and high poop, gilded and crimson, with a great flag at the mast-head, and many banners waving from the decks, and a row of shields, bright as silver, along the bulwarks. The gangplank was laid to her, and at the foot of it, just ready to go on board, stood an old, old man. He wore a rich mantle of scarlet which opened in front to show his silver mail shirt. There was a thin circlet of gold on his head. His beard, white as wool, fell nearly to his waist. He stood straight enough, leaning one hand on the shoulder of a richly dressed lord who seemed younger than himself: but you could see he was very old and frail. He looked as if a puff of wind could blow him away, and his eyes were watery.

Immediately in front of the King—who had turned round to speak to his people before going on board the ship—there was a little chair on wheels, and, harnessed to it, a little donkey: not much bigger than a big retriever. In this chair sat a fat little dwarf. He was as richly dressed as the King, but because of his fatness and because he was sitting hunched up among cushions, the effect was quite different: it made him look like a shapeless little bundle of fur and silk and velvet. He was as old as the King, but more hale and hearty, with very keen eyes. His bare head, which was bald and extremely large, shone like a gigantic billiard ball in the sunset light.

Further back, in a half-circle, stood what Jill at once knew to be the courtiers. They were well worth looking at for their clothes and armour alone. As far as that went, they looked more like a flower-bed than a crowd. But what really made Jill open her eyes and mouth as wide as they would go, was the people themselves. If “people” was the right word. For only about one in every five was human. The rest were things you never see in our world. Fauns, satyrs, centaurs: Jill could give a name to these, for she had seen pictures of them. Dwarfs too. And there were a lot of animals she knew as well; bears, badgers, moles, leopards, mice, and various birds. But then they were so very different from the animals which one called by the same names in England. Some of them were much bigger—the mice, for instance, stood on their hind legs and were over two feet high. But quite apart from that, they all looked different. You could see by the expression in their faces that they could talk and think just as well as you could.

“Golly!” thought Jill. “So it's true after all.” But next moment she added, “I wonder, are they friendly?” For she had just noticed, on the outskirts of the crowd, one or two giants and some people whom she couldn't give a name to at all.

At that moment Aslan and the signs rushed back into her mind. She had forgotten all about them for the last half-hour.

“Scrubb!” she whispered, grabbing his arm. “Scrubb, quick! Do you see anyone you know?”

“So you've turned up again, have you?” said Scrubb disagreeably (for which he had some reason). “Well, keep quiet, can't you? I want to listen.”

“Don't be a fool,” said Jill. “There isn't a moment to lose. Don't you see some old friend here? Because you've got to go and speak to him at once.”

“What are you talking about?” said Scrubb.

“It's Aslan—the Lion—says you've got to,” said Jill despairingly. “I've seen him.”

“Oh, you have, have you? What did he say?”

“He said the very first person you saw in Narnia would be an old friend, and you'd got to speak to him at once.”

“Well, there's nobody here I've ever seen in my life before; and anyway, I don't know whether this is Narnia.”

“Thought you said you'd been here before,” said Jill.

“Well, you thought wrong then.”

“Well, I like that! You told me—”

“For heaven's sake dry up and let's hear what they're saying.”

The King was speaking to the Dwarf, but Jill couldn't hear what he said. And, as far as she could make out, the Dwarf made no answer, though he nodded and wagged his head a great deal. Then the King raised his voice and addressed the whole court: but his voice was so old and cracked that she could understand very little of his speech—especially since it was all about people and places she had never heard of. When the speech was over, the King stooped down and kissed the Dwarf on both cheeks, straightened himself, raised his right hand as if in blessing, and went, slowly and with feeble steps, up the gangway and on board the ship. The courtiers appeared to be greatly moved by his departure. Handkerchiefs were got out, sounds of sobbing were heard in every direction. The gangway was cast off, trumpets sounded from the poop, and the ship moved away from the quay. (It was being towed by a rowing-boat, but Jill didn't see that.)

“Now—” said Scrubb, but he didn't get any further, because at that moment a large white object—Jill thought for a second that it was a kite—came gliding through the air and alighted at his feet. It was a white owl, but so big that it stood as high as a good-sized dwarf.

It blinked and peered as if it were short-sighted, and put its head a little on one side, and said in a soft, hooting kind of voice:

“Tu-whoo, tu-whoo! Who are you two?”

“My name's Scrubb, and this is Pole,” said Eustace. “Would you mind telling us where we are?”

“In the land of Narnia, at the King's castle of Cair Paravel.”

“Is that the King who's just taken ship?”

“Too true, too true,” said the Owl sadly, shaking its big head. “But who are you? There's something magic about you two. I saw you arrive: you flew. Everyone else was so busy seeing the King off that nobody knew. Except me. I happened to notice you, you flew.”

“We were sent here by Aslan,” said Eustace in a low voice.

“Tu-whoo, tu-whoo!” said the Owl, ruffling out its feathers. “This is almost too much for me, so early in the evening. I'm not quite myself till the sun's down.”

“And we've been sent to find the lost Prince,” said Jill, who had been anxiously waiting to get into the conversation.

“It's the first I've heard about it,” said Eustace. “What prince?”

“You had better come and speak to the Lord Regent at once,” it said. “That's him, over there in the donkey carriage; Trumpkin the Dwarf.” The bird turned and began leading the way, muttering to itself, “Whoo! Tu-whoo! What a to-do! I can't think clearly yet. It's too early.”

“What is the King's name?” asked Eustace.

“Caspian the Tenth,” said the Owl. And Jill wondered why Scrubb had suddenly pulled up short in his walk and turned an extraordinary colour. She thought she had never seen him look so sick about anything. But before she had time to ask any questions they had reached the dwarf, who was just gathering up the reins of his donkey and preparing to drive back to the castle. The crowd of courtiers had broken up and were going in the same direction, by ones and twos and little knots, like people coming away from watching a game or a race.

“Tu-whoo! Ahem! Lord Regent,” said the Owl, stooping down a little and holding its beak near the Dwarf's ear.

“Heh? What's that?” said the Dwarf.

“Two strangers, my lord,” said the Owl.

“Rangers! What d'ye mean?” said the Dwarf. “I see two uncommonly grubby man-cubs. What do they want?”

“My name's Jill,” said Jill, pressing forward. She was very eager to explain the important business on which they had come.

“The girl's called Jill,” said the Owl, as loud as it could.

“What's that?” said the Dwarf. “The girls are all killed! I don't believe a word of it. What girls? Who killed 'em?”

“Only one girl, my lord,” said the Owl. “Her name is Jill.”

“Speak up, speak up,” said the Dwarf. “Don't stand there buzzing and twittering in my ear. Who's been killed?”

“Nobody's been killed,” hooted the Owl.

“Who?”

“NOBODY.”

“All right, all right. You needn't shout. I'm not so deaf as all that. What do you mean by coming here to tell me that nobody's been killed? Why should anyone have been killed?”

“Better tell him I'm Eustace,” said Scrubb.

“The boy's Eustace, my lord,” hooted the Owl as loud as it could.

“Useless?” said the Dwarf irritably. “I dare say he is. Is that any reason for bringing him to court? Hey?”

“Not useless,” said the Owl. “EUSTACE.”

“Used to it, is he? I don't know what you're talking about, I'm sure. I tell you what it is, Master Glimfeather; when I was a young Dwarf there used to be talking beasts and birds in this country who really could talk. There wasn't all this mumbling and muttering and whispering. It wouldn't have been tolerated for a moment. Not for a moment, Sir. Urnus, my trumpet please—”

A little Faun who had been standing quietly beside the Dwarf's elbow all this time now handed him a silver eartrumpet. It was made like the musical instrument called a serpent, so that the tube curled right round the Dwarf's neck. While he was getting it settled the Owl, Glimfeather, suddenly said to the children in a whisper:

“My brain's a bit clearer now. Don't say anything about the lost Prince. I'll explain later. It wouldn't do, wouldn't do, Tu-Whoo! Oh what a to-do!”

“Now,” said the Dwarf, “if you have anything sensible to say, Master Glimfeather, try and say it. Take a deep breath and don't attempt to speak too quickly.”

With help from the children, and in spite of a fit of coughing on the part of the Dwarf, Glimfeather explained that the strangers had been sent by Aslan to visit the court of Narnia. The Dwarf glanced quickly up at them with a new expression in his eyes.

“Sent by the Lion Himself, hey?” he said. “And from—m'm—from that other Place—beyond the world's end, hey?”

“Yes, my lord,” bawled Eustace into the trumpet.

“Son of Adam and Daughter of Eve, hey?” said the Dwarf. But people at Experiment House haven't heard of Adam and Eve, so Jill and Eustace couldn't answer this. But the Dwarf didn't seem to notice.

“Well, my dears,” he said, taking first one and then the other by the hand and bowing his head a little. “You are very heartily welcome. If the good King, my poor Master, had not this very hour set sail for Seven Isles, he would have been glad of your coming. It would have brought back his youth to him for a moment—for a moment. And now, it is high time for supper. You shall tell me your business in full council tomorrow morning. Master Glimfeather, see that bedchambers and suitable clothes and all else are provided for these guests in the most honourable fashion. And—Glimfeather—in your ear—”

Here the Dwarf put his mouth close to the Owl's head and, no doubt, intended to whisper: but, like other deaf people, he wasn't a very good judge of his own voice, and both children heard him say, “See that they're properly washed.”

After that, the Dwarf touched up his donkey and it set off towards the castle at something between a trot and a waddle (it was a very fat little beast), while the Faun, the Owl, and the children followed at a rather slower pace. The sun had set and the air was growing cool.

They went across the lawn and then through an orchard and so to the North Gate of Cair Paravel, which stood wide open. Inside, they found a grassy courtyard. Lights were already showing from the windows of the great hall on their right and from a more complicated mass of buildings straight ahead. Into these the Owl led them, and there a most delightful person was called to look after Jill. She was not much taller than Jill herself, and a good deal slenderer, but obviously full grown, graceful as a willow, and her hair was willowy too, and there seemed to be moss in it.

She brought Jill to a round room in one of the turrets, where there was a little bath sunk in the floor and a fire of sweetsmelling woods burning on the flat hearth and a lamp hanging by a silver chain from the vaulted roof. The window looked west into the strange land of Narnia, and Jill saw the red remains of the sunset still glowing behind distant mountains. It made her long for more adventures and feel sure that this was only the beginning.

When she had had her bath, and brushed her hair, and put on the clothes that had been laid out for her—they were the kind that not only felt nice, but looked nice and smelled nice and made nice sounds when you moved as well—she would have gone back to gaze out of that exciting window, but she was interrupted by a bang on the door.

“Come in,” said Jill. And in came Scrubb, also bathed and splendidly dressed in Narnian clothes. But his face didn't look as if he were enjoying it.

“Oh, here you are at last,” he said crossly, flinging himself into a chair. “I've been trying to find you for ever so long.”

“Well, now you have,” said Jill. “I say, Scrubb, isn't it all simply too exciting and scrumptious for words?” She had forgotten all about the signs and the lost Prince for the moment.

“Oh! That's what you think, is it?” said Scrubb: and then, after a pause, “I wish to goodness we'd never come.”

“Why on earth?”

“I can't bear it,” said Scrubb. “Seeing the King—Caspian—a doddering old man like that. It's—it's frightful.”

“Why, what harm does it do you?”

“Oh, you don't understand. Now that I come to think of it, you couldn't. I didn't tell you that this world has a different time from ours.”

“How do you mean?”

“The time you spend here doesn't take up any of our time. Do you see? I mean, however long we spend here, we shall still get back to Experiment House at the moment we left it—”

“That won't be much fun—”

“Oh, dry up! Don't keep interrupting. And when you're back in England—in our world—you can't tell how time is going here. It might be any number of years in Narnia while we're having one year at home. The Pevensies explained it all to me, but, like a fool, I forgot about it. And now apparently it's been about seventy years—Narnian years—since I was here last. Do you see now? And I come back and find Caspian an old, old man.”

“Then the King was an old friend of yours!” said Jill. A horrid thought had struck her.

“I should jolly well think he was,” said Scrubb miserably. “About as good a friend as a chap could have. And last time he was only a few years older than me. And to see that old man with a white beard, and to remember Caspian as he was the morning we captured the Lone Islands, or in the fight with the Sea Serpent—oh, it's frightful. It's worse than coming back and finding him dead.”

“Oh, shut up,” said Jill impatiently. “It's far worse than you think. We've muffed the first Sign.” Of course Scrubb did not understand this. Then Jill told him about her conversation with Aslan and the four signs and the task of finding the lost prince which had been laid upon them.

“So you see,” she wound up, “you did see an old friend, just as Aslan said, and you ought to have gone and spoken to him at once. And now you haven't, and everything is going wrong from the very beginning.”

“But how was I to know?” said Scrubb.

“If you'd only listened to me when I tried to tell you, we'd be all right,” said Jill.

“Yes, and if you hadn't played the fool on the edge of that cliff and jolly nearly murdered me—all right, I said murder, and I'll say it again as often as I like, so keep your hair on—we'd have come together and both known what to do.”

“I suppose he was the first person you saw?” said Jill. “You must have been here hours before me. Are you sure you didn't see anyone else first?”

“I was only here about a minute before you,” said Scrubb. “He must have blown you quicker than me. Making up for lost time: the time you lost.”

“Don't be a perfect beast, Scrubb,” said Jill. “Hullo! What's that?”

It was the castle bell ringing for supper, and thus what looked like turning into a first-rate quarrel was happily cut short. Both had a good appetite by this time.

Supper in the great hall of the castle was the most splendid thing either of them had ever seen; for though Eustace had been in that world before, he had spent his whole visit at sea and knew nothing of the glory and courtesy of the Narnians at home in their own land. The banners hung from the roof, and each course came in with trumpeters and kettledrums. There were soups that would make your mouth water to think of, and the lovely fishes called pavenders, and venison and peacock and pies, and ices and jellies and fruit and nuts, and all manner of wines and fruit drinks. Even Eustace cheered up and admitted that it was “something like”. And when all the serious eating and drinking was over, a blind poet came forward and struck up the grand old tale of Prince Cor and Aravis and the horse Bree, which is called The Horse and His Boy and tells of an adventure that happened in Narnia and Calormen and the lands between, in the Golden Age when Peter was High King in Cair Paravel. (I haven't time to tell it now, though it is well worth hearing.)

When they were dragging themselves upstairs to bed, yawning their heads off, Jill said, “I bet we sleep well, tonight”; for it had been a full day. Which just shows how little anyone knows what is going to happen to them next.





CHAPTER FOUR: A PARLIAMENT OF OWLS


IT is a very funny thing that the sleepier you are, the longer you take about getting to bed; especially if you are lucky enough to have a fire in your room. Jill felt she couldn't even start undressing unless she sat down in front of the fire for a bit first. And once she had sat down, she didn't want to get up again. She had already said to herself about five times, “I must go to bed”, when she was startled by a tap on the window.

She got up, pulled the curtain, and at first saw nothing but darkness. Then she jumped and started backwards, for something very large had dashed itself against the window, giving a sharp tap on the glass as. it did so. A very unpleasant idea came into her head—“Suppose they have giant moths in this country! Ugh!” But then the thing came back, and this time she was almost sure she saw a beak, and that the beak had made that tapping noise. “It's some huge bird,” thought Jill. “Could it be an eagle?” She didn't very much want a visit even from an eagle, but she opened the window and looked out. Instantly, with a great whirring noise, the creature alighted on the window-sill and stood there filling up the whole window, so that Jill had to step back to make room for it. It was the Owl.

“Hush, hush! Tu-whoo, tu-whoo,” said the Owl. “Don't make a noise. Now, are you two really in earnest about what you've got to do?”

“About the lost Prince, you mean?” said Jill. “Yes, we've got to be.” For now she remembered the Lion's voice and face, which she had nearly forgotten during the feasting and storytelling in the hall.

“Good!” said the Owl. “Then there's no time to waste.

You must get away from here at once. I'll go and wake the other human. Then I'll come back for you. You'd better change those court clothes and put on something you can travel in. I'll be back in two twos. Tu-whoo!” And without waiting for an answer, he was gone.

If Jill had been more used to adventures, she might have doubted the Owl's word, but this never occurred to her: and in the exciting idea of a midnight escape she forgot her sleepiness. She changed back into sweater and shorts—there was a guide's knife on the belt of the shorts which might come in useful—and added a few of the things that had been left in the room for her by the girl with the willowy hair. She chose a short cloak that came down to her knees and had a hood (“just the thing, if it rains,” she thought), a few handkerchiefs and a comb. Then she sat down and waited.

She was getting sleepy again when the Owl returned.

“Now we're ready,” it said.

“You'd better lead the way,” said Jill. “I don't know all these passages yet.”

“Tu-whoo!” said the Owl. “We're not going through the castle. That would never do. You must ride on me. We shall fly.”

“Oh!” said Jill, and stood with her mouth open, not much liking the idea. “Shan't I be too heavy for you?”

“Tu-whoo, tu-whoo! Don't you be a fool. I've already carried the other one. Now. But we'll put out that lamp first.”

As soon as the lamp was out, the bit of the night which you saw through the window looked less dark-no longer black, but grey. The Owl stood on the window-sill with his back to the room and raised his wings. Jill had to climb on to his short fat body and get her knees under the wings and grip tight. The feathers felt beautifully warm and soft but there was nothing to hold on by. “I wonder how Scrubb liked his ride!” thought Jill. And just as she was thinking this, with a horrid plunge they had left the window-sill, and the wings were making a flurry round her ears, and the night air, rather cool and damp, was flying in her face.

It was much lighter than she expected, and though the sky was overcast, one patch of watery silver showed where the moon was hiding above the clouds. The fields beneath her looked grey, and the trees black. There was a certain amount of wind—a hushing, ruffling sort of wind which meant that rain was coming soon.

The Owl wheeled round so that the castle was now ahead of them. Very few of the windows showed lights. They flew right over it, northwards, crossing the river: the air grew colder, and Jill thought she could see the white reflection of the Owl in the water beneath her. But soon they were on the north bank of the river, flying above wooded country.

The Owl snapped at something which Jill couldn't see.

“Oh, don't, please!” said Jill. “Don't jerk like that. You nearly threw me off.”

“I beg your pardon,” said the Owl. “I was just nabbing a bat. There's nothing so sustaining, in a small way, as a nice plump little bat. Shall I catch you one?”

“No, thanks,” said Jill with a shudder.

He was flying a little lower now and a large, black looking object was looming up towards them. Jill had just time to see that it was a tower—a partly ruinous tower, with a lot of ivy on it, she thought—when she found herself ducking to avoid the archway of a window, as the Owl squeezed with her through the ivied cobwebby opening, out of the fresh, grey night into a dark place inside the top of the tower.

It was rather fusty inside and, the moment she slipped off the Owl's back, she knew (as one usually does somehow) that it was quite crowded And when voices began saying out of the darkness from every direction “Tuwhoo! Tu-whoo!” she knew it was crowded with owls. She was rather relieved when a very different voice said:

“Is that you, Pole?”

“Is that you, Scrubb?” said Jill.

“Now,” said Glimfeather, “I think we're all here. Let us hold a parliament of owls.”

“Tu-whoo, tu-whoo. True for you. That's the right thing to do,” said several voices.

“Half a moment,” said Scrubb's voice. “There's something I want to say first.”

“Do, do, do,” said the owls; and Jill said, “Fire ahead.”

“I suppose all you chaps-owls, I mean,” said Scrubb, “I suppose you all know that King Caspian the Tenth, in his young days, sailed to the eastern end of the world. Well, I was with him on that journey: with him and Reepicheep the Mouse, and the Lord Drinian and all of them. I know it sounds hard to believe, but people don't grow older in our world at the same speed as they do in yours. And what I want to say is this, that I'm the King's man; and if this parliament of owls is any sort of plot against the King, I'm having nothing to do with it.”

“Tu-whoo, tu-whoo, we're all the King's owls too,” said the owls.

“What's it all about then?” said Scrubb.

“It's only this,” said Glimfeather. “That if the Lord Regent, the Dwarf Trumpkin, hears you are going to look for the lost Prince, he won't let you start. He'd keep you under lock and key sooner.”

“Great Scott!” said Scrubb. “You don't mean that Trumpkin is a traitor? I used to hear a lot about him in the old days, at sea. Caspian—the King, I mean—trusted him absolutely.”

“Oh no,” said a voice. “Trumpkin's no traitor. But more than thirty champions (knights, centaurs, good giants, and all sorts) have at one time or another set out to look for the lost Prince, and none of them have ever come back. And at last the King said he was not going to have all the bravest Narnians destroyed in the search for his son. And now nobody is allowed to go.”

“But surely he'd let us go,” said Scrubb. “When he knew who I was and who had sent me.”

(“Sent both of us,” put in Jill.)

“Yes,” said Glimfeather, “I think, very likely, he would. But the King's away. And Trumpkin will stick to the rules. He's as true as steel, but he's deaf as a post and very peppery. You could never make him see that this might be the time for making an exception to the rule.”

“You might think he'd take some notice of us, because we're owls and everyone knows how wise owls are,” said someone else. “But he's so old now he'd only say, ‘You're a mere chick. I remember you when you were an egg. Don't come trying to teach me, Sir. Crabs and crumpets!’”

This owl imitated Trumpkin's voice rather well, and there were sounds of owlish laughter all round. The children began to see that the Narnians all felt about Trumpkin as people feel at school about some crusty teacher, whom everyone is a little afraid of and everyone makes fun of and nobody really dislikes.

“How long is the King going to be away?” asked Scrubb.

“If only we knew!” said Glimfeather. “You see, there has been a rumour lately that Aslan himself has been seen in the islands—in Terebinthia, I think it was. And the King said he would make one more attempt before he died to see Aslan face to face again, and ask his advice about who is to be King after him. But we're all afraid that, if he doesn't meet Aslan in Terebinthia, he'll go on east, to Seven Isles and Lone Islands—and on and on. He never talks about it, but we all know he has never forgotten that voyage to the world's end. I'm sure in his heart of hearts he wants to go there again.”

“Then there's no good waiting for him to come back?” said Jill.

“No, no good,” said the Owl. “Oh, what a to-do! If only you two had known and spoken to him at once! He'd have arranged everything—probably given you an army to go with you in search of the Prince.”

Jill kept quiet at this and hoped Scrubb would be sporting enough not to tell all the owls why this hadn't happened. He was, or very nearly. That is, he only muttered under his breath, “Well, it wasn't my fault,” before saying out loud:

“Very well. We'll have to manage without it. But there's just one thing more I want to know. If this owls' parliament, as you call it, is all fair and above board and means no mischief, why does it have to be so jolly secret—meeting in a ruin in dead of night, and all that?”

“Tu-whoo! Tu-whoo!” hooted several owls. “Where should we meet? When would anyone meet except at night?”

“You see,” explained Glimfeather, “most of the creatures in Narnia have such unnatural habits. They do things by day, in broad blazing sunlight (ugh!) when everyone ought to be asleep. And, as a result, at night they're so blind and stupid that you can't get a word out of them. So we owls have got into the habit of meeting at sensible hours, on our own, when we want to talk about things.”

“I see,” said Scrubb. “Well now, let's get on. Tell us all about the lost Prince.” Then an old owl, not Glimfeather, related the story.

About ten years ago, it appeared, when Rilian, the son of Caspian, was a very young knight, he rode with the Queen his mother on a May morning in the north parts of Narnia. They had many squires and ladies with them and all wore garlands of fresh leaves on their heads, and horns at their sides; but they had no hounds with them, for they were maying, not hunting.

In the warm part of the day they came to a pleasant glade where a fountain flowed freshly out of the earth, and there they dismounted and ate and drank and were merry. After a time the Queen felt sleepy, and they spread cloaks for her on the grassy bank, and Prince Rilian with the rest of the party went a little way from her, that their tales and laughter might not wake her.

And so, presently, a great serpent came out of the thick wood and stung the Queen in her hand. All heard her cry out and rushed towards her, and Rilian was first at her side. He saw the worm gliding away from her and made after it with his sword drawn. It was great, shining, and as green as poison, so that he could see it well: but it glided away into thick bushes and he could not come at it. So he returned to his mother, and found them all busy about her. But they were busy in vain, for at the first glance of her face Rilian knew that no physic in the world would do her good. As long as the life was in her she seemed to be trying hard to tell him something. But she could not speak clearly and, whatever her message was, she died without delivering it. It was then hardly ten minutes since they had first heard her cry.

They carried the dead Queen back to Cair Paravel, and she was bitterly mourned by Rilian and by the King, and by all Narnia. She had been a great lady, wise and gracious and happy, King Caspian's bride whom he had brought home from the eastern end of the world. And men said that the blood of the stars flowed in her veins. The Prince took his mother's death very hardly, as well he might. After that, he was always riding on the northern marches of Narnia, hunting for that venomous worm, to kill it and be avenged. No one remarked much on this, though the Prince came home from these wanderings looking tired and distraught. But about a month after the Queen's death, some said they could see a change in him. There was a look in his eyes as of a man who has seen visions, and though he would be out all day, his horse did not bear the signs of hard riding. His chief friend among the older courtiers was the Lord Driman, he who had been his father's captain on that great voyage to the east parts of the earth.

One evening Drinian said to the Prince, “Your Highness must soon give over seeking the worm. There is no true vengeance on a witless brute as there might be on a man. You weary yourself in vain.” The Prince answered him, “My Lord, I have almost forgotten the worm this seven days.” Drinian asked him why, if that were so, he rode so continually in the northern woods. “My lord,” said the Prince, “I have seen there the most beautiful thing that was ever made.” “Fair Prince,” said Drinian, “of your courtesy let me ride with you tomorrow, that I also may see this fair thing.” “With a good will,” said Rilian.

Then in good time on the next day they saddled their horses and rode a great gallop into the northern woods and alighted at that same fountain where the Queen got her death. Drinian thought it strange that the Prince should choose that place of all places, to linger in. And there they rested till it came to high noon: and at noon Drinian looked up and saw the most beautiful lady he had ever seen; and she stood at the north side of the fountain and said no word but beckoned to the Prince with her hand as if she bade him come to her. And she was tall and great, shining, and wrapped in a thin garment as green as poison. And the Prince stared at her like a man out of his wits. But suddenly the lady was gone, Driman knew not where; and the two returned to Cair Paravel. It stuck in Drinian's mind that this shining green woman was evil.

Drinian doubted very much whether he ought not to tell this adventure to the King, but he had little wish to be a blab and a tale-bearer and so he held his tongue. But afterwards he wished he had spoken. For next day Prince Rilian rode out alone. That night he came not back, and from that hour no trace of him was ever found in Narnia nor any neighbouring land, and neither his horse nor his hat nor his cloak nor anything else was ever found.

Then Drinian in the bitterness of his heart went to Caspian and said, “Lord King, slay me speedily as a great traitor: for by my silence I have destroyed your son.” And he told him the story.

Then Caspian caught up a battle-axe and rushed upon the Lord Drinian to kill him, and Drinian stood still as a stock for the death blow. But when the axe was raised, Caspian suddenly threw it away and cried out, “I have lost my queen and my son: shall I lose my friend also?” And he fell upon the Lord Drinian's neck and embraced him and both wept, and their friendship was not broken.

Such was the story of Rilian. And when it was over, Jill said, “I bet that serpent and that woman were the same person.”

“True, true, we think the same as you,” hooted the owls.

“But we don't think she killed the Prince,” said Glimfeather, “because no bones—”

“We know she didn't,” said Scrubb. “Aslan told Pole he was still alive somewhere.”

“That almost makes it worse,” said the oldest owl. “It means she has some use for him, and some deep scheme against Narnia. Long, long ago, at the very beginning, a White Witch came out of the North and bound our land in snow and ice for a hundred years. And we think this may be some of the same crew.”

“Very well, then,” said Scrubb. “Pole and I have got to find this Prince. Can you help us?”

“Have you any clue, you two?” asked Glimfeather.

“Yes,” said Scrubb. “We know we've got to go north. And we know we've got to reach the ruins of a giant city.”

At this there was a greater tu-whooing than ever, and noise of birds shifting their feet and ruffling their feathers, and then all the owls started speaking at once. They all explained how very sorry they were that they themselves could not go with the children on their search for the lost Prince

“You'd want to travel by day, and we'd want to travel by night,” they said. “It wouldn't do, wouldn't do.” One or two owls added that even here in the ruined tower it wasn't nearly so dark as it had been when they began, and that the parliament had been going on quite long enough. In fact, the mere mention of a journey to the ruined city of giants seemed to have damped the spirits of those birds.

But Glimfeather said: “If they want to go that way—into Ettinsmoor—we must take them to one of the Marsh-wiggles. They're the Only people who can help them much.”

“'True, true. Do,” said the owls.

“Come on, then,” said Glimfeather. “I'll take one. Who'll take the other? It must be done tonight.”

“I will: as far as the Marsh-wiggles,” said another owl.

“Are you ready?” said Glimfeather to Jill.

“I think Pole's asleep,” said Scrubb.





CHAPTER FIVE: PUDDLEGLUM


JILL was asleep. Ever since the owls' parliament began she had been yawning terribly and now she had dropped off. She was not at all pleased at being waked again, and at finding herself lying on bare boards in a dusty belfry sort of place, completely dark, and almost completely full of owls. She was even less pleased when she heard that they had to set off for somewhere else—and not, apparently, for bed—on the Owl's back.

“Oh, come on, Pole, buck up,” said Scrubb's voice. “After all, it is an adventure.”

“I'm sick of adventures,” said Jill crossly.

She did, however, consent to climb on to Glimfeather's back, and was thoroughly waked up (for a while) by the unexpected coldness of the air when he flew out with her into the night. The moon had disappeared and there were no stars. Far behind her she could see a single lighted window well above the ground; doubtless, in one of the towers of Cair Paravel. It made her long to be back in that delightful bedroom, snug in bed, watching the firelight on the walls.

She put her hands under her cloak and wrapped it tightly round her. It was uncanny to hear two voices in the dark air a little distance away; Scrubb and his owl were talking to one another. “He doesn't sound tired,” thought Jill. She did not realize that he had been on great adventures in that world before and that the Narnian air was bringing back to him a strength he had won when he sailed the Eastern Seas with King Caspian.

Jill had to pinch herself to keep awake, for she knew that if she dozed on Glimfeather's back she would probably fall off. When at last the two owls ended their flight, she climbed stiffly off Glimfeather and found herself on flat ground. A chilly wind was blowing and they appeared to be in a place without trees. “Tu-whoo, tu-whoo!” Glimfeather was calling. “Wake up, Puddleglum. Wake up. It is on the Lion's business.”

For a long time there was no reply. Then, a long way off, a dim light appeared and began to come nearer. With it came a voice.

“Owls ahoy!” it said. “What is it? Is the King dead? Has an enemy landed in Narnia? Is it a flood? Or dragons?”

When the light reached them, it turned out to be that of a large lantern. She could see very little of the person who held it. He seemed to be all legs and arms. The owls were talking to him, explaining everything, but she was too tired to listen. She tried to wake herself up a bit when she realized that they were saying goodbye to her. But she could never afterwards remember much except that, sooner or later, she and Scrubb were stooping to enter a low doorway and then (oh, thank heavens) were lying down on something soft and warm, and a voice was saying:

“There you are. Best we can do. You'll lie cold and hard. Damp too, I shouldn't wonder. Won't sleep a wink, most likely; even if there isn't a thunderstorm or a flood or the wigwam doesn't fall down on top of us all, as I've known them do. Must make the best of it—” But she was fast asleep before the voice had ended.

When the children woke late next morning they found that they were lying, very dry and warm, on beds of straw in a dark place. A triangular opening let in the daylight.

“Where on earth are we?” asked Jill.

“In the wigwam of a Marsh-wiggle,” said Eustace.

“A what?”

“A Marsh-wiggle. Don't ask me what it is. I couldn't see it last night. I'm getting up. Let's go and look for it.”

“How beastly one feels after sleeping in one's clothes,” said Jill, sitting up.

“I was just thinking how nice it was not to have to dress,” said Eustace.

“Or wash either, I suppose,” said Jill scornfully. But Scrubb had already got up, yawned, shaken himself, and crawled out of the wigwam. Jill did the same.

What they found outside was quite unlike the bit of Narnia they had seen on the day before. They were on a great flat plain which was cut into countless little islands by countless channels of water. The islands were covered with coarse grass and bordered with reeds and rushes. Sometimes there were beds of rushes about an acre in extent. Clouds of birds were constantly alighting in them and rising from them again—duck, snipe, bitterns, herons. Many wigwams like that in which they had passed the night could be seen dotted about, but all at a good distance from one another; for Marsh-wiggles are people who like privacy.

Except for the fringe of the forest several miles to the south and west of them, there was not a tree in sight. Eastward the flat marsh stretched to low sandhills on the horizon, and you could tell by the salt tang in the wind which blew from that direction that the sea lay over there. To the North there were low pale-coloured hills, in places bastioned with rock. The rest was all flat marsh. It would have been a depressing place on a wet evening. Seen under a morning sun, with a fresh wind blowing, and the air filled with the crying of birds, there was something fine and fresh and clean about its loneliness. The children felt their spirits rise.

“Where has the thingummy got to, I wonder?” said Jill.

“The Marsh-wiggle,” said Scrubb, as if he were rather proud of knowing the word. “I expect—hullo, that must be him.” And then they both saw him, sitting with his back to them, fishing, about fifty yards away. He had been hard to see at first because he was nearly the same colour as the marsh and because he sat so still.

“I suppose we'd better go and speak to him,” said Jill. Scrubb nodded. They both felt a little nervous.

As they drew nearer, the figure turned its head and showed them a long thin face with rather sunken cheeks, a tightly shut mouth, a sharp nose, and no beard. He was wearing a high, pointed hat like a steeple, with an enormously wide flat brim. The hair, if it could be called hair, which hung over his large ears was greeny-grey, and each lock was flat rather than round, so that they were like tiny reeds. His expression was solemn, his complexion muddy, and you could see at once that he took a serious view of life.

“Good morning, Guests,” he said. “Though when I say good I don't mean it won't probably turn to rain or it might he snow, or fog, or thunder. You didn't get any sleep, I dare say.

“Yes we did, though,” said Jill. “We had a lovely night.”

“Ah,” said the Marsh-wiggle, shaking his head. “I see you're making the best of a bad job. That's right. You've been well brought up, you have. You've learned to put a good face on things.”

“Please, we don't know your name,” said Scrubb.

“Puddleglum's my name. But it doesn't matter if you forget it. I can always tell you again.”

The children sat down on each side of him. They now saw that he had very long legs and arms, so that although his body was not much bigger than a dwarf's, he would be taller than most men when he stood up. The fingers of his hands were webbed like a frog's, and so were his bare feet which dangled in the muddy water. He was dressed in earth-coloured clothes that hung loose about him.

“I'm trying to catch a few eels to make an eel stew for our dinner,” said Puddleglum. “Though I shouldn't wonder if I didn't get any. And you won't like them much if I do.”

“Why not?” asked Scrubb.

“Why, it's not in reason that you should like our sort of victuals, though I've no doubt you'll put a bold face on it. All the same, while I am a catching of them, if you two could try to light the fire-no harm trying-! The wood's behind the wigwam. It may be wet. You could light it inside the wigwam, and then we'd get all the smoke in our eyes. Or you could light it outside, and then the rain would come and put it out. Here's my tinder-box. You won't know how to use it, I expect.”

But Scrubb had learned that sort of thing on his last adventure. The children ran back together to the wigwam, found the wood (which was perfectly dry) and succeeded in lighting a fire with rather less than the usual difficulty. Then Scrubb sat and took care of it while Jill went and had some sort of wash—not a very nice one—in the nearest channel. After that she saw to the fire and he had a wash. Both felt a good deal fresher, but very hungry.

Presently the Marsh-wiggle joined them. In spite of his expectation of catching no eels, he had a dozen or so, which he had already skinned and cleaned. He put a big pot on, mended the fire, and lit his pipe. Marsh-wiggles smoke a very strange, heavy sort of tobacco (some people say they mix it with mud) and the children noticed the smoke from Puddleglum's pipe hardly rose in the air at all. It trickled out of the bowl and downwards and drifted along the ground like a mist. It was very black and set Scrubb coughing.

“Now,” said Puddleglum. “Those eels will take a mortal long time to cook, and either of you might faint with hunger before they're done. I knew a little girl—but I'd better not tell you that story. It might lower your spirits, and that's a thing I never do. So, to keep your minds off your hunger, we may as well talk about our plans.”

“Yes, do let's,” said Jill. “Can you help us to find Prince Rilian?”

The Marsh-wiggle sucked in his cheeks till they were hollower than you would have thought possible. “Well, I don't know that you'd call it help,” he said. “I don't know that anyone can exactly help. It stands to reason we're not likely to get very far on a journey to the North, not at this time of the year, with the winter coming on soon and all. And an early winter too, by the look of things. But you mustn't let that make you down-hearted. Very likely, what with enemies, and mountains, and rivers to cross, and losing our way, and next to nothing to eat, and sore feet, we'll hardly notice the weather. And if we don't get far enough to do any good, we may get far enough not to get back in a hurry.”

Both children noticed that he said “we”, not “you”, and both exclaimed at the same moment. “Are you coming with us?”

“Oh yes, I'm coming of course. Might as well, you see. I don't suppose we shall ever see the King back in Narnia, now that he's once set off for foreign parts; and he had a nasty cough when he left. Then there's Trumpkin. He's failing fast. And you'll find there'll have been a bad harvest after this terrible dry summer. And I shouldn't wonder if some enemy attacked us. Mark my words.”

“And how shall we start?” said Scrubb.

“Well,” said the Marsh-wiggle very slowly, “all the others who ever went looking for Prince Rilian started from that same fountain where the Lord Drinian saw the lady. They went north, mostly. And as none of them ever came back, we can't exactly say how they got on.”

“We've got to start by finding a ruined city of giants,” said Jill. “Aslan said so.”

“Got to start by finding it, have we?” answered Puddleglum. “Not allowed to start by looking for it, I suppose?”

“That's what I meant, of course,” said Jill. “And then, when we've found it—”

“Yes, when!” said Puddleglum very drily.

“Doesn't anyone know where it is?” asked Scrubb.

“I don't know about Anyone,” said Puddleglum. “And I won't say I haven't heard of that Ruined City. You wouldn't start from the fountain, though. You'd have to go across Ettinsmoor. That's where the Ruined City is, if it's anywhere. But I've been as far in that direction as most people and I never got to any ruins, so I won't deceive you.”

“Where's Ettinsmoor?” said Scrubb.

“Look over there northward,” said Puddleglum, pointing with his pipe. “See those hills and bits of cliff? That's the beginning of Ettinsmoor. But there's a river between it and us; the river Shribble. No bridges, of course.”

“I suppose we can ford it, though,” said Scrubb.

“Well, it has been forded,” admitted the Marsh-wiggle.

“Perhaps we shall meet people on Ettinsmoor who can tell us the way,” said Jill.

“You're right about meeting people,” said Puddleglum.

“What sort of people live there?” she asked.

“It's not for me to say they aren't all right in their own way,” answered Puddleglum. “If you like their way.”

“Yes, but what are they?” pressed Jill. “There are so many queer creatures in this country. I mean, are they animals, or birds, or dwarfs, or what?”

The Marsh-wiggle gave a long whistle. “Phew!” he said. “Don't you know? I thought the owls had told you. They're giants.”

Jill winced. She had never liked giants even in books, and she had once met one in a nightmare. Then she saw Scrubb's face, which had turned rather green, and thought to herself, “I bet he's in a worse funk than I am.” That made her feel braver.

“The King told me long ago,” said Scrubb—“that time when I was with him at sea—that he'd jolly well beaten those giants in war and made them pay him tribute.”

“That's true enough,” said Puddleglum. “They're at peace with us all right. As long as we stay on our own side of the Shribble, they won't do us any harm. Over on their side, on the Moor-Still, there's always a chance. If we don't get near any of them, and if none of them forget themselves, and if we're not seen, it's just possible we might get a long way.”

“Look here!” said Scrubb, suddenly losing his temper, as people so easily do when they have been frightened. “I don't believe the whole thing can be half as bad as you're making out; any more than the beds in the wigwam were hard or the wood was wet. I don't think Aslan would ever have sent us if there was so little chance as all that.”

He quite expected the Marsh-wiggle to give him an angry reply, but he only said, “That's the spirit, Scrubb. That's the way to talk. Put a good face on it. But we all need to be very careful about our tempers, seeing all the hard times we shall have to go through together. Won't do to quarrel, you know. At any rate, don't begin it too soon. I know these expeditions usually end that way: knifing one another, I shouldn't wonder, before all's done. But the longer we can keep off it—”

“Well, if you feel it's so hopeless,” interrupted Scrubb, “I think you'd better stay behind. Pole and I can go on alone, can't we, Pole?”

“Shut up and don't be an ass, Scrubb,” said Jill hastily, terrified lest the Marsh-wiggle should take him at his word.

“Don't you lose heart, Pole,” said Puddleglum. “I'm coming, sure and certain. I'm not going to lose an opportunity like this. It will do me good. They all say—I mean, the other wiggles all say—that I'm too flighty; don't take life seriously enough. If they've said it once, they've said it a thousand times. 'Puddleglum,' they've said, ‘you're altogether too full of bobance and bounce and high spirits. You've got to learn that life isn't all fricasseed frogs and eel pie. You want something to sober you down a bit. We're only saying it for your own good, Puddleglum.’ That's what they say. Now a job like this—a journey up north just as winter's beginning, looking for a Prince that probably isn't there, by way of a ruined city that no one has ever seen—will be just the thing. If that doesn't steady a chap, I don't know what will.” And he rubbed his big frog-like hands together as if he were talking of going to a party or a pantomime. “And now,” he added, “let's see how those eels are getting on.”

When the meal came it was delicious and the children had two large helpings each. At first the Marsh-wiggle wouldn't believe that they really liked it, and when they had eaten so much that he had to believe them, he fell back on saying that it would probably disagree with them horribly. “What's food for wiggles may be poison for humans, I shouldn't wonder,” he said. After the meal they had tea, in tins (as you've seen men having it who are working on the road), and Puddleglum had a good many sips out of a square black bottle. He offered the children some of it, but they thought it very nasty.

The rest of the day was spent in preparations for an early start tomorrow morning. Puddleglum, being far the biggest, said he would carry three blankets, with a large bit of bacon rolled up inside them. Jill was to carry the remains of the eels, some biscuit, and the tinder-box. Scrubb was to carry both his own cloak and Jill's when they didn't want to wear them. Scrubb (who had learned some shooting when he sailed to the East under Caspian) had Puddleglum's secondbest bow, and Puddleglum had his best one; though he said that what with winds, and damp bowstrings, and bad light, and cold fingers, it was a hundred to one against either of them hitting anything. He and Scrubb both had swords—Scrubb had brought the one which had been left out for him in his room at Cair Paravel—but Jill had to be content with her knife. There would have been a quarrel about this, but as soon as they started sparring the wiggle rubbed his hands and said, “Ah, there you are. I thought as much. That's what usually happens on adventures.” This made them both shut up.

All three went to bed early in the wigwam. This time the children really had a rather badnight. That was because Puddleglum, after saying, “You'd better try for some sleep, youtwo; not that I suppose any of us will close an eye tonight,” instantly went off into such aloud, continuous snore that, when Jill at last got to sleep, she dreamed all night about road-drills and waterfalls and being in express trains in tunnels.





CHAPTER SIX: THE WILD WASTE LANDS OF THE NORTH


AT about nine o'clock next morning three lonely figures might have been seen picking their way across the Shribble by the shoals and stepping-stones. It was a shallow, noisy stream, and even Jill was not wet above her knees when they reached the northern bank. About fifty yards ahead, the land rose up to the beginning of the moor, everywhere steeply, and often in cliffs.

“I suppose that's our way!” said Scrubb, pointing left and west to where a stream flowed down from the moor through a shallow gorge. But the Marsh-wiggle shook his head.

“The giants mainly live along the side of that gorge,” he said. “You might say the gorge was like a street to them. We'll do better straight ahead, even though it's a bit steep.”

They found a place where they could scramble up, and in about ten minutes stood panting at the top. They cast a longing look back at the valley-land of Narnia and then turned their faces to the North. The vast, lonely moor stretched on and up as far as they could see. On their left was rockier ground. Jill thought that must be the edge of the giants' gorge and did not much care about looking in that direction. They set out.

It was good, springy ground for walking, and a day of pale winter sunlight. As they got deeper into the moor, the loneliness increased: one could hear peewits and see an occasional hawk. When they halted in the middle of the morning for a rest and a drink in a little hollow by a stream, Jill was beginning to feel that she might enjoy adventures after all, and said so.

“We haven't had any yet,” said the Marsh-wiggle.

Walks after the first halt—like school mornings after break or railway journeys after changing trains—never go on as they were before. When they set out again, Jill noticed that the rocky edge of the gorge had drawn nearer. And the rocks were less flat, more upright, than they had been. In fact they were like little towers of rock. And what funny shapes they were!

“I do believe,” thought Jill, “that all the stories about giants might have come from those funny rocks. If you were coming along here when it was half dark, you could easily think those piles of rock were giants. Look at that one, now! You could almost imagine that the lump on top was a head. It would be rather too big for the body, but it would do well enough for an ugly giant. And all that bushy stuff—I suppose it's heather and birds' nests, really—would do quite well for hair and beard. And the things sticking out on each side are quite like ears. They'd be horribly big, but then I dare say giants would have big ears, like elephants. And—o-o-o-h!—”

Her blood froze. The thing moved. It was a real giant. There was no mistaking it; she had seen it turn its head. She had caught a glimpse of the great, stupid, puffcheeked face. All the things were giants, not rocks. There were forty or fifty of them, all in a row; obviously standing with their feet on the bottom of the gorge and their elbows resting on the edge of the gorge, just as men might stand leaning on a wall—lazy men, on a fine morning after breakfast.

“Keep straight on,” whispered Puddleglum, who had noticed them too. “Don't look at them. And whatever you do, don't run. They'd be after us in a moment.”

So they kept on, pretending not to have seen the giants. It was like walking past the gate of a house where there is a fierce dog, only far worse. There were dozens and dozens of these giants. They didn't look angry—or kind—or interested at all. There was no sign that they had seen the travellers.

Then—whizz-whizz-whizz—some heavy object came hurtling through the air, and with a crash a big boulder fell about twenty paces ahead of them. And then—thud!—another fell twenty feet behind.

“Are they aiming at us?” asked Scrubb.

“No,” said Puddleglum. “We'd be a good deal safer if they were. They're trying to hit that—that cairn over there to the right. They won't hit it, you know. It's safe enough; they're such very bad shots. They play cock-shies most fine mornings. About the only game they're clever enough to understand.”

It was a horrible time. There seemed no end to the line of giants, and they never ceased hurling stones, some of which fell extremely close. Quite apart from the real danger, the very sight and sound of their faces and voices were enough to scare anyone. Jill tried not to look at them.

After about twenty-five minutes the giants apparently had a quarrel. This put an end to the cock-shies, but it is not pleasant to be within a mile of quarrelling giants. They stormed and jeered at one another in long, meaningless words of about twenty syllables each. They foamed and gibbered and jumped in their rage, and each jump shook the earth like a bomb. They lammed each other on the head with great, clumsy stone hammers; but their skulls were so hard that the hammers bounced off again, and then the monster who had given the blow would drop his hammer and howl with pain because it had stung his fingers. But he was so stupid that he would do exactly the same thing a minute later. This was a good thing in the long run, for by the end of an hour all the giants were so hurt that they sat down and began to cry. When they sat down, their heads were below the edge of the gorge, so that you saw them no more; but Jill could hear them howling and blubbering and boo-booing like great babies even after the place was a mile behind.

That night they bivouacked on the bare moor, and Puddleglum showed the children how to make the best of their blankets by sleeping back to back. (The backs keep each other warm and you can then have both blankets on top.) But it was chilly even so, and the ground was hard and lumpy. The Marsh-wiggle told them they would feel more comfortable if only they thought how very much colder it would be later on and further north; but this didn't cheer them up at all.

They travelled across Ettinsmoor for many days, saving the bacon and living chiefly on the moor-fowl (they were not, of course, talking birds) which Eustace and the wiggle shot. Jill rather envied Eustace for being able to shoot; he had learned it on his voyage with King Caspian. As there were countless streams on the moor, they were never short of water. Jill thought that when, in books, people live on what they shoot, it never tells you what a long, smelly, messy job it is plucking and cleaning dead birds, and how cold it makes your fingers. But the great thing was that they met hardly any giants. One giant saw them, but he only roared with laughter and stumped away about his own business.

About the tenth day, they reached a place where the country changed. They came to the northern edge of the moor and looked down a long, steep slope into a different, and grimmer, land. At the bottom of the slope were cliffs: beyond these, a country of high mountains, dark precipices, stony valleys, ravines so deep and narrow that one could not see far into them, and rivers that poured out of echoing gorges to plunge sullenly into black depths. Needless to say, it was Puddleglum who pointed out a sprinkling of snow on the more distant slopes.

“But there'll be more on the north side of them, I shouldn't wonder,” he added.

It took them some time to reach the foot of the slope and, when they did, they looked down from the top of the cliffs at a river running below them from west to east. It was walled in by precipices on the far side as well as on their own, and it was green and sunless, full of rapids and waterfalls. The roar of it shook the earth even where they stood.

“The bright side of it is,” said Puddleglum, “that if we break our necks getting down the cliff, then we're safe from being drowned in the river.”

“What about that?” said Scrubb suddenly, pointing upstream to their left. Then they all looked and saw the last thing they were expecting—a bridge. And what a bridge, too! It was a huge, single arch that spanned the gorge from cliff-top to cliff-top; and the crown of that arch was as high above the cliff-tops as the dome of St Paul's is above the street.

“Why, it must be a giants' bridge!” said Jill.

“Or a sorcerer's, more likely,” said Puddleglum. “We've got to look out for enchantments in a place like this. I think it's a trap. I think it'll turn into mist and melt away just when we're out on the middle of it.”

“Oh, for goodness' sake, don't be such a wet blanket,” said Scrubb. “Why on earth shouldn't it be a proper bridge?”

“Do you think any of the giants we've seen would have sense to build a thing like that?” said Puddleglum.

“But mightn't it have been built by other giants?” said Jill. “I mean, by giants who lived hundreds of years ago, and were far cleverer than the modern kind. It might have been built by the same ones who built the giant city we're looking for. And that would mean we were on the right track-the old bridge leading to the old city!”

“That's a real brainwave, Pole,” said Scrubb. “It must be that. Come on.”

So they turned and went to the bridge. And when they reached it, it certainly seemed solid enough. The single stones were as big as those at Stonehenge and must have been squared by good masons once, though now they were cracked and crumbled. The balustrade had apparently been covered with rich carvings, of which some traces remained; mouldering faces and forms of giants, minotaurs, squids, centipedes, and dreadful gods. Puddleglum still didn't trust it, but he consented to cross it with the children.

The climb up to the crown of the arch was long and heavy. In many places the great stones had dropped out, leaving horrible gaps through which you looked down on the river foaming thousands of feet below. They saw an eagle fly through under their feet. And the higher they went, the colder it grew, and the wind blew so that they could hardly keep their footing. It seemed to shake the bridge.

When they reached the top and could look down the further slope of the bridge, they saw what looked like the remains of an ancient giant road stretching away before them into the heart of the mountains. Many stones of its pavement were missing and there were wide patches of grass between those that remained. And riding towards them on that ancient road were two people of normal grown-up human size.

“Keep on. Move towards them,” said Puddleglum. “Anyone you meet in a place like this is as likely as not to be an enemy, but we mustn't let them think we're afraid.”

By the time they had stepped off the end of the bridge on to the grass, the two strangers were quite close. One was a knight in complete armour with his visor down. His armour and his horse were black; there was no device on his shield and no banneret on his spear. The other was a lady on a white horse, a horse so lovely that you wanted to kiss its nose and give it a lump of sugar at once. But the lady, who rode side-saddle and wore a long, fluttering dress of dazzling green, was lovelier still.

“Good day, t-r-r-avellers,” she cried out in a voice as sweet as the sweetest bird's song, trilling her R's delightfully. “Some of you are young pilgrims to walk this rough waste.”

“That's as may be, Ma'am,” said Puddleglum very stiffly and on his guard.

“We're looking for the ruined city of the giants,” said Jill.

“The r-r-ruined city?” said the Lady. “That is a strange place to be seeking. What will you do if you find it?”

“We've got to—” began Jill, but Puddleglum interrupted.

“Begging your pardon, Ma'am. But we don't know you or your friend—a silent chap, isn't he?—and you don't know us. And we'd as soon not talk to strangers about our business, if you don't mind. Shall we have a little rain soon, do you think?”

The Lady laughed: the richest, most musical laugh you can imagine. “Well, children,” she said, “you have a wise, solemn old guide with you. I think none the worse of him for keeping his own counsel, but I'll be free with mine. I have often heard the name of the giantish City Ruinous, but never met any who would tell me the way thither. This road leads to the burgh and castle of Harfang, where dwell the gentle giants. They are as mild, civil, prudent, and courteous as those of Ettinsmoor are foolish, fierce, savage, and given to all beastliness. And in Harfang you may or may not hear tidings of the City Ruinous, but certainly you shall find good lodgings and merry hosts. You would be wise to winter there, or, at the least, to tarry certain days for your ease and refreshment. There you shall have steaming baths, soft beds, and bright hearths; and the roast and the baked and the sweet and the strong will be on the table four times in a day.”

“I say!” exclaimed Scrubb. “That's something like! Think of sleeping in a bed again.”

“Yes, and having a hot bath,” said Jill. “Do you think they'll ask us to stay? We don't know them, you see.”

“Only tell them,” answered the Lady, “that She of the Green Kirtle salutes them by you, and has sent them two fair Southern children for the Autumn Feast.”

“Oh, thank you, thank you ever so much,” said Jill and Scrubb.

“But have a care,” said the Lady. “On whatever day you reach Harfang, that you come not to the door too late. For they shut their gates a few hours after noon, and it is the custom of the castle that they open to none when once they have drawn bolt, how hard so ever he knock.”

The children thanked her again, with shining eyes, and the Lady waved to them. The Marsh-wiggle took off his steeple-hat and bowed very stiffly. Then the silent Knight and the Lady started walking their horses up the slope of the bridge with a great clatter of hoofs.

“Well!” said Puddleglum. “I'd give a good deal to know where she's coming from and where she's going. Not the sort you expect to meet in the wilds of Giantland, is she? Up to no good, I'll be bound.”

“Oh rot!” said Scrubb. “I thought she was simply super. And think of hot meals and warm rooms. I do hope Harfang isn't a long way off.”

“Same here,” said Jill. “And hadn't she a scrumptious dress. And the horse!”

“All the same,” said Puddleglum, “I wish we knew a bit more about her.”

“I was going to ask her all about herself,” said Jill. “But how could I when you wouldn't tell her anything about us?”

“Yes,” said Scrubb. “And why were you so stiff and unpleasant. Didn't you like them?”

“Them?” said the wiggle. “Who's them? I only saw one.”

“Didn't you see the Knight?” asked Jill.

“I saw a suit of armour,” said Puddleglum. “Why didn't he speak?”

“I expect he was shy,” said Jill. “Or perhaps he just wants to look at her and listen to her lovely voice. I'm sure I would if I was him.”

“I was wondering,” remarked Puddleglum, “what you'd really see if you lifted up the visor of that helmet and looked inside.”

“Hang it all,” said Scrubb. “Think of the shape of the armour! What could be inside it except a man?”

“How about a skeleton?” asked the Marsh-wiggle with ghastly cheerfulness. “Or perhaps,” he added as an afterthought, “nothing at all. I mean, nothing you could see. Someone invisible.”

“Really, Puddleglum,” said Jill with a shudder, “you do have the most horrible ideas. How do you think of them all?”

“Oh, bother his ideas!” said Scrubb. “He's always expecting the worst, and he's always wrong. Let's think about those Gentle Giants and get on to Harfang as quickly as we can. I wish I knew how far it is.”

And now they nearly had the first of those quarrels which Puddleglum had foretold: not that Jill and Scrubb hadn't been sparring and snapping at each other a good deal before, but this was the first really serious disagreement. Puddleglum didn't want them to go to Harfang at all. He said that he didn't know what a giant's idea of being “gentle” might be, and that, anyway, Aslan's signs had said nothing about staying with giants, gentle or otherwise. The children, on the other hand, who were sick of wind and rain, and skinny fowl roasted over campfires, and hard, cold earth to sleep on, were absolutely dead set to visit the Gentle Giants. In the end, Puddleglum agreed to do so, but only on one condition. The others must give an absolute promise that, unless he gave them leave, they would not tell the Gentle Giants that they came from Narnia or that they were looking for Prince Rilian. And they gave him this promise, and went on.

After that talk with the Lady things got worse in two different ways. In the first place the country was much harder. The road led through endless, narrow valleys down which a cruel north wind was always blowing in their faces. There was nothing that could be used for firewood, and there were no nice little hollows to camp in, as there had been on the moor. And the ground was all stony, and made your feet sore by day and every bit of you sore by night.

In the second place, whatever the Lady had intended by telling them about Harfang, the actual effect on the children was a bad one. They could think about nothing but beds and baths and hot meals and how lovely it would be to get indoors. They never talked about Aslan, or even about the lost prince, now. And Jill gave up her habit of repeating the signs over to herself every night and morning. She said to herself, at first, that she was too tired, but she soon forgot all about it. And though you might have expected that the idea of having a good time at Harfang would have made them more cheerful, it really made them more sorry for themselves and more grumpy and snappy with each other and with Puddleglum.

At last they came one afternoon to a place where the gorge in which they were travelling widened out and dark fir woods rose on either side. They looked ahead and saw that they had come through the mountains. Before them lay a desolate, rocky plain: beyond it, further mountains capped with snow. But between them and those further mountains rose a low hill with an irregular flattish top.

“Look! Look!” cried Jill, and pointed across the plain; and there, through the gathering dusk, from beyond the flat hill, everyone saw lights. Lights! Not moonlight, nor fires, but a homely cheering row of lighted windows. If you have never been in the wild wilderness, day and night, for weeks, you will hardly understand how they felt.

“Harfang!” cried Scrubb and Jill in glad, excited voices; and “Harfang,” repeated Puddleglum in a dull, gloomy voice. But he added, “Hullo! Wild geese!” and had the bow off his shoulder in a second. He brought down a good fat goose. It was far too late to think of reaching Harfang that day. But they had a hot meal and a fire, and started the night warmer than they had been for over a week. After the fire had gone out, the night grew bitterly cold, and when they woke next morning, their blankets were stiff with frost.

“Never mind!” said Jill, stamping her feet. “Hot baths tonight!”





CHAPTER SEVEN: THE HILL OF THE STRANGE TRENCHES


THERE is no denying it was a beast of a day. Overhead was a sunless sky, muffled in clouds that were heavy with snow; underfoot, a black frost; blowing over it, a wind that felt as if it would take your skin off. When they got down into the plain they found that this part of the ancient road was much more ruinous than any they had yet seen. They had to pick their way over great broken stones and between boulders and across rubble: hard going for sore feet. And, however tired they got, it was far too cold for a halt.

At about ten o'clock the first tiny snow flakes came loitering down and settled on Jill's arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white. And by the end of half an hour a good steady snowstorm, which looked as if it meant to last all day, was driving in their faces so that they could hardly see.

In order to understand what followed, you must keep on remembering how little they could see. As they drew near the low hill which separated them from the place where the lighted windows had appeared, they had no general view of it at all. It was a question of seeing the next few paces ahead, and, even for that, you had to screw up your eyes. Needless to say, they were not talking.

When they reached the foot of the hill they caught a glimpse of what might be rocks on each side—squarish rocks, if you looked at them carefully, but no one did. All were more concerned with the ledge right in front of them which barred their way. It was about four feet high. The Marsh-wiggle, with his long legs, had no difficulty in jumping onto the top of it, and he then helped the others up. It was a nasty wet business for them, though not for him, because the snow now lay quite deep on the ledge. They then had a stiff climb—Jill fell once—up very rough ground for about a hundred yards, and came to a second ledge. There were four of these ledges altogether, at quite irregular intervals.

As they struggled on to the fourth ledge, there was no mistaking the fact that they were now at the top of the flat hill. Up till now the slope had given them some shelter; here, they got the full fury of the wind. For the hill, oddly enough, was quite as flat on top as it had looked from a distance: a great level tableland which the storm tore across without resistance. In most places the snow was still hardly lying at all, for the wind kept catching it up off the ground in sheets and clouds, and hurling it in their faces. And round their feet little eddies of snow ran about as you sometimes see them doing over ice. And, indeed, in many places, the surface was almost as smooth as ice. But to make matters worse it was crossed and crisscrossed with curious banks or dykes, which sometimes divided it up into squares and oblongs. All these of course had to be climbed; they varied from two to five feet in height and were about a couple of yards thick. On the north side of each bank the snow already lay in deep drifts; and after each climb you came down into a drift and got wet.

Fighting her way forward with hood up and head down and numb hands inside her cloak, Jill had glimpses of other odd things on that horrible tableland—things on her right that looked vaguely like factory chimneys, and, on her left, a huge cliff, straighter than any cliff ought to be. But she wasn't at all interested and didn't give them a thought. The only things she thought about were her cold hands (and nose and chin and ears) and hot baths and beds at Harfang.

Suddenly she skidded, slid about five feet, and found herself to her horror sliding down into a dark, narrow chasm which seemed that moment to have appeared in front of her. Half a second later she had reached the bottom. She appeared to be in a kind of trench or groove, only about three feet wide. And though she was shaken by the fall, almost the first thing she noticed was the relief of being out of the wind; for the walls of the trench rose high above her. The next thing she noticed was, naturally, the anxious faces of Scrubb and Puddleglum looking down at her from the edge.

“Are you hurt, Pole?” shouted Scrubb.

“Both legs broken, I shouldn't wonder,” shouted Puddleglum.

Jill stood up and explained that she was all right, but they'd have to help her out.

“What is it you've fallen into?” asked Scrubb.

“It's a kind of trench, or it might be a kind of sunken lane or something,” said Jill. “It runs quite straight.”

“Yes, by Jove,” said Scrubb. “And it runs due north! I wonder is it a sort of road? If it was, we'd be out of this infernal wind down there. Is there a lot of snow at the bottom?”

“Hardly any. It all blows over the top, I suppose.”

“What happens further on?”

“Half a sec. I'll go and see,” said Jill. She got up and walked along the trench; but before she had gone far, it turned sharply to the right. She shouted this information back to the others.

“What's round the corner?” asked Scrubb.

Now it happened that Jill had the same feeling about twisty passages and dark places underground, or even nearly underground, that Scrubb had about the edges of cliffs. She had no intention of going round that corner alone; especially when she heard Puddleglum bawling out from behind her:

“Be careful, Pole. It's just the sort of place that might lead to a dragon's cave. And in a giant country, there might be giant earthworms or giant beetles.”

“I don't think it goes anywhere much,” said Jill, coming hastily back.

“I'm jolly well going to have a look,” said Scrubb. “What do you mean by anywhere much, I should like to know?” So he sat down on the edge of the trench (everyone was too wet by now to bother about being a bit wetter) and then dropped in. He pushed past Jill and, though he didn't say anything, she felt sure that he knew she had funked it. So she followed him close, but took care not to get in front of him.

It proved, however, a disappointing exploration. They went round the right-hand turn and straight on for a few paces. Here there was a choice of ways: straight on again, or sharp to the right. “That's no good,” said Scrubb, glancing down the right-hand turn, “that would be taking us back—south.” He went straight on, but once more, in a few steps, they found a second turn to the right. But this time there was no choice of ways, for the trench they had been following here came to a dead end.

“No good,” grunted Scrubb. Jill lost no time in turning and leading the way back. When they returned to the place where Jill had first fallen in, the Marsh-wiggle with his long arms had no difficulty in pulling them out.

But it was dreadful to be out on top again. Down in those narrow slits of trenches, their ears had almost begun to thaw. They had been able to see clearly and breathe easily and hear each other speak without shouting. It was absolute misery to come back into the withering coldness. And it did seem hard when Puddleglum chose that moment for saying:

“Are you still sure of those signs, Pole? What's the one we ought to be after, now?”

“Oh, come on! Bother the signs,” said Pole. “Something about someone mentioning Aslan's name, I think. But I'm jolly well not going to give a recitation here.”

As you see, she had got the order wrong. That was because she had given up saying the signs over every night. She still really knew them, if she troubled to think: but she was no longer so “pat” in her lesson as to be sure of reeling them off in the right order at a moment's notice and without thinking. Puddleglum's question annoyed her because, deep down inside her, she was already annoyed with herself for not knowing the Lion's lesson quite so well as she felt she ought to have known it. This annoyance, added to the misery of being very cold and tired, made her say, “Bother the signs.” She didn't perhaps quite mean it.

“Oh, that was next, was it?” said Puddleglum. “Now I wonder, are you right? Got 'em mixed, I shouldn't wonder. It seems to me, this hill, this flat place we're on, is worth stopping to have a look at. Have you noticed—”

“Oh Lor!” said Scrubb, “is this a time for stopping to admire the view? For goodness' sake let's get on.”

“Oh, look, look, look,” cried Jill and pointed. Everyone turned, and everyone saw. Some way off to the north, and a good deal higher up than the tableland on which they stood, a line of lights had appeared. This time, even more obviously than when the travellers had seen them the night before, they were windows: smaller windows that made one think deliciously of bedrooms, and larger windows that made one think of great halls with fires roaring on the hearth and hot soup or juicy sirloins smoking on the table.

“Harfang!” exclaimed Scrubb.

“That's all very well,” said Puddleglum. “But what I was saying was—”

“Oh, shut up,” said Jill crossly. “We haven't a moment to lose. Don't you remember what the Lady said about their locking up so early? We must get there in time, we must, we must. We'll die if we're shut out on a night like this.”

“Well, it isn't exactly a night, not yet,” began Puddleglum; but the two children both said, “Come on,” and began stumbling forward on the slippery tableland as quickly as their legs would carry them. The Marsh-wiggle followed them: still talking, but now that they were forcing their way into the wind again, they could not have heard him even if they had wanted to. And they didn't want. They were thinking of baths and beds and hot drinks; and the idea of coming to Harfang too late and being shut out was almost unbearable.

In spite of their haste, it took them a long time to cross the flat top of that hill. And even when they had crossed it, there were still several ledges to climb down on the far side. But at last they reached the bottom and could see what Harfang was like.

It stood on a high crag, and in spite of its many towers was more a huge house than a castle. Obviously, the Gentle Giants feared no attack. There were windows in the outside wall quite close to the ground—a thing no one would have in a serious fortress. There were even odd little doors here and there, so that it would be quite easy to get in and out of the castle without going through the courtyard. This raised the spirits of Jill and Scrubb. It made the whole place look more friendly and less forbidding. At first the height and steepness of the crag frightened them, but presently they noticed that there was an easier way up on the left and that the road wound up towards it. It was a terrible climb, after the journey they had already had, and Jill nearly gave up. Scrubb and Puddleglum had to help her for the last hundred yards. But in the end they stood before the castle gate. The portcullis was up and the gate open.

However tired you are, it takes some nerve to walk up to a giant's front door. In spite of all his previous warnings against Harfang, it was Puddleglum who showed most courage.

“Steady pace, now,” he said. “Don't look frightened, whatever you do. We've done the silliest thing in the world by coming at all: but now that we are here, we'd best put a bold face on it.”

With these words he strode forward into the gateway, stood still under the arch where the echo would help his voice, and called out as loud as he could.

“Ho! Porter! Guests who seek lodging.”

And while he was waiting for something to happen, he took off his hat and knocked off the heavy mass of snow which had gathered on its wide brim.

“I say,” whispered Scrubb to Jill. “He may be a wet blanket, but he has plenty of pluck—and cheek.”

A door opened, letting out a delicious glow of firelight, and the Porter appeared. Jill bit her lips for fear she should scream. He was not a perfectly enormous giant; that is to say, he was rather taller than an apple tree but nothing like so tall as a telegraph pole. He had bristly red hair, a leather jerkin with metal plates fastened all over it so as to make a kind of mail shirt, bare knees (very hairy indeed) and things like puttees on his legs. He stooped down and goggled at Puddleglum.

“And what sort of creature do you call yourself,” he said.

Jill took her courage in both hands. “Please,” she said, shouting up at the giant. “The Lady of the Green Kirtle salutes the King of the Gentle Giants, and has sent us two Southern children and this Marsh-wiggle (his name's Puddleglum) to your Autumn Feast. If it's quite convenient, of course,” she added.

“Oho!” said the Porter. “That's quite a different story. Come in, little people, come in. You'd best come into the lodge while I'm sending word to his Majesty.” He looked at the children with curiosity. “Blue faces,” he said. “I didn't know they. were that colour. Don't care about it myself. But I dare say you look quite nice to one another. Beetles fancy other beetles, they do say.”

“Our faces are only blue with cold,” said Jill. “We're not this colour really.”

“Then come in and get warm. Come in, little shrimps,” said the Porter. They followed him into the lodge. And though it was rather terrible to hear such a big door clang shut behind them, they forgot about it as soon as they saw the thing they had been longing for ever since supper time last night—a fire. And such a fire! It looked as if four or five whole trees were blazing on it, and it was so hot they couldn't go within yards of it. But they all flopped down on the brick floor, as near as they could bear the heat, and heaved great sighs of relief.

“Now, youngster,” said the Porter to another giant who had been sitting in the back of the room, staring at the visitors till it looked as if his eyes would start out of his head, “run across with this message to the House.” And he repeated what Jill had said to him. The younger giant, after a final stare, and a great guffaw, left the room.

“Now, Froggy,” said the Porter to Puddleglum, “you look as if you wanted some cheering up.” He produced a black bottle very like Puddleglum's own, but about twenty times larger. “Let me see, let me see,” said the Porter. “I can't give you a cup or you'll drown yourself. Let me see. This salt-cellar will be just the thing. You needn't mention it over at the House. The silver will keep on getting over here, and it's not my fault.”

The salt-cellar was not very like one of ours, being narrower and more upright, and made quite a good cup for Puddleglum, when the giant set it down on the floor beside him.

The children expected Puddleglum to refuse it, distrusting the Gentle Giants as he did. But he muttered, “It's rather late to be thinking of precautions now that we're inside and the door shut behind us.” Then he sniffed at the liquor. “Smells all right,” he said. “But that's nothing to go by. Better make sure,” and took a sip. “Tastes all right, too,” he said. “But it might do that at the first sip. How does it go on?” He took a larger sip. “Ah!” he said. “But is it the same all the way down?” and took another. “There'll be something nasty at the bottom, I shouldn't wonder,” he said, and finished the drink. He licked his lips and remarked to the children, “This'll be a test, you see. If I curl up, or burst, or turn into a lizard, or something, then you'll know not to take anything they offer you.”

But the giant, who was too far up to hear the things Puddleglum had been saying under his breath, roared with laughter and said, “Why, Froggy, you're a man. See him put it away!”

“Not a man... Marsh-wiggle,” replied Puddleglum in a somewhat indistinct voice. “Not frog either: Marsh-wiggle.”

At that moment the door opened behind them and the younger giant came in saying, “They're to go to the throne-room at once.”

The children stood up but Puddleglum remained sitting and said, “Marsh-wiggle. Marsh-wiggle. Very respectable Marsh-wiggle. Respectowiggle.”

“Show them the way, young 'un,” said the giant Porter. “You'd better carry Froggy. He's had a drop more than's good for him.”

“Nothing wrong with me,” said Puddleglum. “Not a frog. Nothing frog with me. I'm a respectabiggle.”

But the young giant caught him up by the waist and signed to the children to follow. In this undignified way they crossed the courtyard. Puddleglum, held in the giant's fist, and vaguely kicking the air, did certainly look very like a frog. But they had little time to notice this, for they soon entered the great doorway of the main castle—both their hearts beating faster than usual—and, after pattering along several corridors at a trot to keep up with the giant's paces, found themselves blinking in the light of an enormous room, where lamps glowed and a fire roared on the hearth and both were reflected from the gilding of roof and cornice. More giants than they could count stood on their left and right, all in magnificent robes; and on two thrones at the far end, sat two huge shapes that appeared to be the King and Queen.

About twenty feet from the thrones, they stopped. Scrubb and Jill made an awkward attempt at a bow (girls are not taught how to curtsey at Experiment House) and the young giant carefully put Puddleglum down on the floor, where he collapsed into a sort of sitting position. With his long limbs he looked, to tell the truth, uncommonly like a large spider.





CHAPTER EIGHT: THE HOUSE OF HARFANG


“GO on, Pole, do your stuff,” whispered Scrubb.

Jill found that her mouth was so dry that she couldn't speak a word. She nodded savagely at Scrubb.

Thinking to himself that he would never forgive her (or Puddleglum either), Scrubb licked his lips and shouted up to the King giant.

“If you please, Sire, the Lady of the Green Kirtle salutes you by us and said you'd like to have us for your Autumn Feast.”

The giant King and Queen looked at each other, nodded to each other, and smiled in a way that Jill didn't exactly like. She liked the King better than the Queen. He had a fine, curled beard and a straight eagle-like nose, and was really rather good-looking as giants go. The Queen was dreadfully fat and had a double chin and a fat, powdered face—which isn't a very nice thing at the best of times, and of course looks much worse when it is ten times too big. Then the King put out his tongue and licked his lips. Anyone might do that: but his tongue was so very large and red, and came out so unexpectedly, that it gave Jill quite a shock.

“Oh, what good children!” said the Queen. (“Perhaps she's the nice one after all,” thought Jill.)

“Yes indeed,” said the King. “Quite excellent children. We welcome you to our court. Give me your hands.”

He stretched down his great right hand—very clean and with any number of rings on the fingers, but also with terrible pointed nails. He was much too big to shake the hands which the children, in turn, held up to him; but he shook the arms.

“And what's that?” asked the King, pointing to Puddleglum.

“Reshpeckobiggle,” said Puddleglum.

“Oh!” screamed the Queen, gathering her skirts close about her ankles. “The horrid thing! It's alive.”

“He's quite all right, your Majesty, really, he is,” said Scrubb hastily. “You'll like him much better when you get to know him. I'm sure you will.”

I hope you won't lose all interest in Jill for the rest of the book if I tell you that at this moment she began to cry. There was a good deal of excuse for her. Her feet and hands and ears and nose were still only just beginning to thaw; melted snow was trickling off her clothes; she had had hardly anything to eat or drink that day; and her legs were aching so that she felt she could not go on standing much longer. Anyway, it did more good at the moment than anything else would have done, for the Queen said:

“Ah, the poor child! My lord, we do wrong to keep our guests standing. Quick, some of you! Take them away. Give them food and wine and baths. Comfort the little girl. Give her lollipops, give her dolls, give her physics, give her all you can think of-possets and comfits and caraways and lullabies and toys. Don't cry, little girl, or you won't be good for anything when the feast comes.”

Jill was just as indignant as you and I would have been at the mention of toys and dolls; and, though lollipops and comfits might be all very well in their way, she very much hoped that something more solid would be provided. The Queen's foolish speech, however, produced excellent results, for Puddleglum and Scrubb were at once picked up by gigantic gentlemen-in-waiting, and Jill by a gigantic maid of honour, and carried off to their rooms.

Jill's room was about the size of a church, and would have been rather grim if it had not had a roaring fire on the hearth and a very thick crimson carpet on the floor. And here delightful things began to happen to her. She was handed over to the Queen's old Nurse, who was, from the giants' point of view, a little old woman almost bent double with age, and, from the human point of view, a giantess small enough to go about an ordinary room without knocking her head on the ceiling. She was very capable, though Jill did wish she wouldn't keep on clicking her tongue and saying things like “Oh la, la! Ups-a-daisy” and “There's a duck” and “Now we'll be all right, my poppet”.

She filled a giant foot-bath with hot water and helped Jill into it. If you can swim (as Jill could) a giant bath is a lovely thing. And giant towels, though a bit rough and coarse, are lovely too, because there are acres of them. In fact you don't need to dry at all, you just roll about on them in front of the fire and enjoy yourself. And when that was over, clean, fresh, warmed clothes were put on Jill: very splendid clothes and a little too big for her, but clearly made for humans not giantesses. “I suppose if that woman in the green kirtle comes here, they must be used to guests of our size,” thought Jill.

She soon saw that she was right about this, for a table and chair of the right height for an ordinary grown-up human were placed for her, and the knives and forks and spoons were the proper size too. It was delightful to sit down, feeling warm and clean at last. Her feet were still bare and it was lovely to tread on the giant carpet. She sank in it well over her ankles and it was just the thing for sore feet. The meal—which I suppose we must call dinner, though it was nearer tea time—was cock-a-leekie soup, and hot roast turkey, and a steamed pudding, and roast chestnuts, and as much fruit as you could eat.

The only annoying thing was that the Nurse kept coming in and out, and every time she came in, she brought a gigantic toy with her—a huge doll, bigger than Jill herself, a wooden horse on wheels, about the size of an elephant, a drum that looked like a young gasometer, and a woolly lamb. They were crude, badly made things, painted in very bright colours, and Jill hated the sight of them. She kept on telling the Nurse she didn't want them, but the Nurse said:

“Tut-tut-tut-tut. You'll want 'em all right when you've had a bit of a rest, I know! Te-he-he! Beddy bye, now. A precious poppet!”

The bed was not a giant bed but only a big four-poster, like what you might see in an oldfashioned hotel; and very small it looked in that enormous room. She was very glad to tumble into it.

“Is it still snowing, Nurse?” she asked sleepily.

“No. Raining now, ducky!” said the giantess. “Rain'll wash away all the nasty snow. Precious poppet will be able to go out and play tomorrow!” And she tucked Jill up and said good night.

I know nothing so disagreeable as being kissed by a giantess. Jill thought the same, but was asleep in five minutes.

The rain fell steadily all the evening and all the night, dashing against the windows of the castle, and Jill never heard it but slept deeply, past supper time and past midnight. And then came the deadest hour of the night and nothing stirred but mice in the house of the giants. At that hour there came to Jill a dream. It seemed to her that she awoke in the same room and saw the fire, sunk low and red, and in the firelight the great wooden horse. And the horse came of its own will, rolling on its wheels across the carpet, and stood at her head. And now it was no longer a horse, but a lion as big as the horse. And then it was not a toy lion, but a real lion, The Real Lion, just as she had seen him on the mountain beyond the world's end. And a smell of all sweet-smelling things there arefilled the room. But there was some trouble in Jill's mind, though she c ould not think what it was, and the tears streamed down her face and wet the pillow. The Lion told her to repeat the signs, and she found that she had forgotten them all. At that, a great horror came over her. And Aslan took her up in his jaws (she could feel his lips and his breath but not his teeth) and carried her to the window and made her look out. The moon shone bright; and written in great letters across the world or the sky (she did not know which) were the words UNDER ME. After that, the dream faded away, and when she woke, very late next morning, she did not remember that she had dreamed at all.

She was up and dressed and had finished breakfast in front of the fire when the Nurse opened the door and said: “Here's pretty poppet's little friends come to play with her.”

In came Scrubb and the Marsh-wiggle.

“Hullo! Good morning,” said Jill. “Isn't this fun? I've slept about fifteen hours, I believe. I do feel better, don't you?”

“I do,” said Scrubb, “but Puddleglum says he has a headache. Hullo!—your window has a window seat. If we got up on that, we could see out.” And at once they all did so: and at the first glance Jill said, “Oh, how perfectly dreadful!”

The sun was shining and, except for a few drifts, the snow had been almost completely washed away by the rain. Down below them, spread out like a map, lay the flat hill-top which they had struggled over yesterday afternoon; seen from the castle, it could not be mistaken for anything but the ruins of a gigantic city. It had been flat, as Jill now saw, because it was still, on the whole, paved, though in places the pavement was broken. The criss-cross banks were what was left of the walls of huge buildings which might once have been giants' palaces and temples. One bit of wall, about five hundred feet high, was still standing; it was that which she had thought was a cliff. The things that had looked like factory chimneys were enormous pillars, broken off at unequal heights; their fragments lay at their bases like felled trees of monstrous stone. The ledges which they had climbed down on the north side of the hill—and also, no doubt the other ledges which they had climbed up on the south side—were the remaining steps of giant stairs. To crown all, in large, dark lettering across the centre of the pavement, ran the words UNDER ME.

The three travellers looked at each other in dismay, and, after a short whistle, Scrubb said what they were all thinking, “The second and third signs muffed.” And at that moment Jill's dream rushed back into her mind.

“It's my fault,” she said in despairing tones. “I—I'd given up repeating the signs every night. If I'd been thinking about them I could have seen it was the city, even in all that snow.”

“I'm worse,” said Puddleglum. “I did see, or nearly. I thought it looked uncommonly like a ruined city.”

“You're the only one who isn't to blame,” said Scrubb. “You did try to make us stop.”

“Didn't try hard enough, though,” said the Marshwiggle. “And I'd no call to be trying. I ought to have done it. As if I couldn't have stopped you two with one hand each!”

“The truth is,” said Scrubb, “we were so jolly keen on getting to this place that we weren't bothering about anything else. At least I know I was. Ever since we met that woman with the knight who didn't talk, we've been thinking of nothing else. We'd nearly forgotten about Prince Rilian.”

“I shouldn't wonder,” said Puddleglum, “if that wasn't exactly what she intended.”

“What I don't quite understand,” said Jill, “is how we didn't see the lettering? Or could it have come there since last night. Could he—Aslan—have put it there in the night? I had such a queer dream.” And she told them all about it.

“Why, you chump!” said Scrubb. “We did see it. We got into the lettering. Don't you see? We got into the letter E in ME. That was your sunk lane. We walked along the bottom stroke of the E, due north—turned to our right along the upright—came to another turn to the right—that's the middle stroke—and then went on to the top left-hand corner, or (if you like) the north-eastern corner of the letter, and came back. Like the bally idiots we are.” He kicked the window seat savagely, and went on, “So it's no good, Pole. I know what you were thinking because I was thinking the same. You were thinking how nice it would have been if Aslan hadn't put the instructions on the stones of the ruined city till after we'd passed it. And then it would have been his fault, not ours. So likely, isn't it? No. We must just own up. We've only four signs to go by, and we've muffed the first three.”

“You mean I have,” said Jill. “It's quite true. I've spoiled everything ever since you brought me here. All the same—I'm frightfully sorry and all that—all the same, what are the instructions? UNDER ME doesn't seem to make much sense.”

“Yes it does, though,” said Puddleglum. “It means we've got to look for the Prince under that city.”

“But how can we?” asked Jill.

“That's the question,” said Puddleglum, rubbing his big, frog-like hands together. “How can we now? No doubt, if we'd had our minds on our job when we were at the Ruinous City, we'd have been shown how—found a little door, or a cave, or a tunnel, met someone to help us. Might have been (you never know) Aslan himself. We'd have got down under those paving-stones somehow or other. Aslan's instructions always work: there are no exceptions. But how to do it now—that's another matter.”

“Well, we shall just have to go back, I suppose,” said Jill.

“Easy, isn't it?” said Puddleglum. “We might try opening that door to begin with.” And they all looked at the door and saw that none of them could reach the handle, and that almost certainly no one could turn it if they did.

“Do you think they won't let us out if we ask?” said Jill. And nobody said, but everyone thought, “Supposing they don't.”

It was not a pleasant idea. Puddleglum was dead against any idea of telling the giants their real business and simply asking to be let out; and of course the children couldn't tell without his permission, because they had promised. And all three felt pretty sure that there would be no chance of escaping from the castle by night. Once they were in their rooms with the doors shut, they would be prisoners till morning. They might, of course, ask to have their doors left open, but that would rouse suspicions.

“Our only chance,” said Scrubb, “is to try to sneak away by daylight. Mightn't there be an hour in the afternoon when most of the giants are asleep?—and if we could steal down into the kitchen, mightn't there be a back door open?”

“It's hardly what I call a Chance,” said the Marshwiggle. “But it's all the chance we're likely to get.” As a matter of fact, Scrubb's plan was not quite so hopeless as you might think. If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try it than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren't meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you're found climbing out of a bedroom window at one o'clock in the morning.)

“We must put them off their guard, though,” said Scrubb. “We must pretend we love being here and are longing for this Autumn Feast.”

“That's tomorrow night,” said Puddleglum. “I heard one of them say so.”

“I see,” said Jill. “We must pretend to be awfully excited about it, and keep on asking questions. They think we're absolute infants anyway, which will make it easier.”

“Gay,” said Puddleglum with a deep sigh. “That's what we've got to be. Gay. As if we hadn't a care in the world. Frolicsome. You two youngsters haven't always got very high spirits, I've noticed. You must watch me, and do as I do. I'll be gay. Like this”—and he assumed a ghastly grin. “And frolicsome”—here he cut a most mournful caper. “You'll soon get into it, if you keep your eyes on me. They think I'm a funny fellow already, you see. I dare say you two thought I was a trifle tipsy last night, but I do assure you it was—well, most of it was—put on. I had an idea it would come in useful, somehow.”

The children, when they talked over their adventures afterwards, could never feel sure whether this last statement was quite strictly true; but they were sure that Puddleglum thought it was true when he made it.

“All right. Gay's the word,” said Scrubb. “Now, if we could only get someone to open this door. While we're fooling about and being gay, we've got to find out all we can about this castle.”

Luckily, at that very moment the door opened, and the giant Nurse bustled in saying, “Now, my poppets. Like to come and see the King and all the court setting out on the hunting? Such a pretty sight!”

They lost no time in rushing out past her and climbing down the first staircase they came to. The noise of hounds and horns and giant voices guided them, so that in a few minutes they reached the courtyard. The giants were all on foot, for there are no giant horses in that part of the world, and the giants' hunting is done on foot; like beagling in England. The hounds were also of normal size.

When Jill saw that there were no horses she was at first dreadfully disappointed, for she felt sure that the great fat Queen would never go after hounds on foot; and it would never do to have her about the house all day. But then she saw the Queen in a kind of litter supported on the shoulders of six young giants. The silly old creature was all got up in green and had a horn at her side.

Twenty or thirty giants, including the King, were assembled, ready for the sport, all talking and laughing fit to deafen you: and down below, nearer Jill's level, there were wagging tails, and barking, and loose, slobbery mouths and noses of dogs thrust into your hand. Puddleglum was just beginning to strike what he thought a gay and gamesome attitude (which might have spoiled everything if it had been noticed) when Jill put on her most attractively childish smile, rushed across to the Queen's litter and shouted up to the Queen.

“Oh, please! You're not going away, are you? You will come back?”

“Yes, my dear,” said the Queen. “I'll be back tonight.”

“Oh, good. How lovely!” said Jill. “And we may come to the feast tomorrow night, mayn't we? We're so longing for tomorrow night! And we do love being here. And while you're out, we may run over the whole castle and see everything, mayn't we? Do say yes.”

The Queen did say yes, but the laughter of all the courtiers nearly drowned her voice.





CHAPTER NINE: HOW THEY DISCOVERED SOMETHING WORTH KNOWING


THE others admitted afterwards that Jill had been wonderful that day. As soon as the King and the rest of the hunting party had set off, she began making a tour of the whole castle and asking questions, but all in such an innocent, babyish way that no one could suspect her of any secret design. Though her tongue was never still, you could hardly say she talked: she prattled and giggled. She made love to everyone—the grooms, the porters, the housemaids, the ladies-in-waiting, and the elderly giant lords whose hunting days were past. She submitted to being kissed and pawed about by any number of giantesses, many of whom seemed sorry for her and called her “a poor little thing” though none of them explained why. She made especial friends with the cook and discovered the allimportant fact there was a scullery door which let you out through the outer wall, so that you did not have to cross the courtyard or pass the great gatehouse. In the kitchen she pretended to be greedy, and ate all sorts of scraps which the cook and scullions delighted to give her. But upstairs among the ladies she asked questions about how she would be dressed for the great feast, and how long she would be allowed to sit up, and whether she would dance with some very, very small giant. And then (it made her hot all over when she remembered it afterwards) she would put her head on one side in an idiotic fashion which grown-ups, giant and otherwise, thought very fetching, and shake her curls, and fidget, and say, “Oh, I do wish it was tomorrow night, don't you? Do you think the time will go quickly till then?” And all the giantesses said she was a perfect little darling; and some of them dabbed their eyes with enormous handkerchiefs as if they were going to cry.

“They're dear little things at that age,” said one giantess to another. “It seems almost a pity...”

Scrubb and Puddleglum both did their best, but girls do that kind of thing better than boys. Even boys do it better than Marsh-wiggles.

At lunchtime something happened which made all three of them more anxious than ever to leave the castle of the Gentle Giants. They had lunch in the great hall at a little table of their own, near the fireplace. At a bigger table, about twenty yards away, half a dozen old giants were lunching. Their conversation was so noisy, and so high up in the air, that the children soon took no more notice of it than you would of hooters outside the window or traffic noises in the street. They were eating cold venison, a kind of food which Jill had never tasted before, and she was liking it.

Suddenly Puddleglum turned to them, and his face had gone so pale that you could see the paleness under the natural muddiness of his complexion. He said:

“Don't eat another bite.”

“What's wrong?” asked the other two in a whisper.

“Didn't you hear what those giants were saying? ‘That's a nice tender haunch of venison,’ said one of them. ‘Then that stag was a liar,’ said another. ‘Why?’ said the first one. ‘Oh,’ said the other. ‘They say that when he was caught he said, Don't kill me, I'm tough. You won't like me.”’

For a moment Jill did not realize the full meaning of this. But she did when Scrubb's eyes opened wide with horror and he said: “So we've been eating a Talking stag.”

This discovery didn't have exactly the same effect on all of them. Jill, who was new to that world, was sorry for the poor stag and thought it rotten of the giants to have killed him. Scrubb, who had been in that world before and had at least one Talking beast as his dear friend, felt horrified; as you might feel about a murder. But Puddleglum, who was Narnian born, was sick and faint, and felt as you would feel if you found you had eaten a baby.

“We've brought the anger of Aslan on us,” he said. “That's what comes of not attending to the signs. We're under a curse, I expect. If it was allowed, it would be the best thing we could do, to take these knives and drive them into our own hearts.”

And gradually even Jill came to see it from his point of view. At any rate, none of them wanted any more lunch. And as soon as they thought it safe they crept quietly out of the hall.

It was now drawing near to that time of the day on which their hopes of escape depended, and all became nervous. They hung about in passages and waited for things to become quiet. The giants in the hall sat on a dreadfully long time after the meal was over. The bald one was telling a story. When that was over, the three travellers dawdled down to the kitchen. But there were still plenty of giants there, or at least in the scullery, washing up and putting things away. It was agonizing, waiting till these finished their jobs and, one by one, wiped their hands and went away. At last only one old giantess was left in the room. She pottered about, and pottered about, and at last the three travellers realized with horror that she did not intend to go away at all.

“Well, dearies,” she said to them. “That job's about through. Let's put the kettle there. That'll make a nice cup of tea presently. Now I can have a little bit of a rest. Just look into the scullery, like good poppets, and tell me if the back door is open.”

“Yes, it is,” said Scrubb.

“That's right. I always leave it open so as Puss can get in and out, the poor thing.”

Then she sat down on one chair and put her feet up on another.

“I don't know as I mightn't have forty winks,” said the giantess. “If only that blarney hunting party doesn't come back too soon.”

All their spirits leaped up when she mentioned forty winks, and flopped down again when she mentioned the return of the hunting party.

“When do they usually comeback?” asked Jill.

“You never can tell,” said the giantess. “But there; go and be quiet for a bit, my dearies.”

They retreated to the far end of the kitchen, and would have slipped out into the scullery there and then if the giantess had not sat up, opened her eyes, and brushed away a fly.

“Don't try it till we're sure she's really asleep,” whispered Scrubb. “Or it'll spoil everything.”

So they all huddled at the kitchen end, waiting and watching. The thought that the hunters might come back at any moment was terrible. And the giantess was fidgety. Whenever they thought she had really gone to sleep, she moved.

“I can't bear this,” thought Jill. To distract her mind, she began looking about her. Just in front of her was a clean wide table with two clean pie-dishes on it, and an open book. They were giant pie-dishes of course. Jill thought that she could lie down just comfortably in one of them. Then she climbed up on the bench beside the table to look at the book. She read:

MALLARD. This delicious bird can be cooked in a variety of ways.

“It's a cookery book,” thought Jill without much interest, and glanced over her shoulder. The giantess's eyes were shut but she didn't look as if she were properly asleep. Jill glanced back at the book. It was arranged alphabetically: and at the very next entry her heart seemed to stop beating; it ran—

MAN. This elegant little biped has long been valued as a delicacy. It forms a traditional part of the Autumn Feast, and is served between the fish and the joint. Each Man—

but she could not bear to read any more. She turned round. The giantess had wakened up and was having a fit of coughing. Jill nudged the other two and pointed to the book. They also mounted the bench and bent over the huge pages. Scrubb was still reading about how to cook Men when Puddleglum pointed to the next entry below it. It was like this:

MARSH-WIGGLE. Some authorities reject this animal altogether as unfit for giants' consumption because of its stringy consistency and muddy flavour. The flavour can, however, be greatly reduced if—

Jill touched his feet, and Scrubb's, gently. All three looked back at the giantess. Her mouth was slightly open and from her nose there came a sound which at that moment was more welcome to them than any music; she snored. And now it was a question of tiptoe work, not daring to go too fast, hardly daring to breathe, out through the scullery (giant sculleries smell horrid), out at last into the pale sunlight of a winter afternoon.

They were at the top of a rough little path which ran steeply down. And, thank heavens, on the right side of the castle; the City Ruinous was in sight. In a few minutes they were back on the broad, steep road which led down from the main gate of the castle. They were also in full view from every single window on that side. If it had been one, or two, or five windows there'd be a reasonable chance that no one might be looking out. But there were nearer fifty than five. They now realized, too, that the road on which they were, and indeed all the ground between them and the City Ruinous, didn't offer as much cover as would hide a fox; it was all coarse grass and pebbles and flat stones. To make matters worse, they were now in the clothes that the giants had provided for them last night: except Puddleglum, whom nothing would fit. Jill wore a vivid green robe, rather too long for her, and over that a scarlet mantle fringed with white fur. Scrubb had scarlet stockings, blue tunic and cloak, a gold-hilted sword, and a feathered bonnet.

“Nice bits of colour, you two are,” muttered Puddleglum. “Show up very prettily on a winter day. The worst archer in the world couldn't miss either of you if you were in range. And talking of archers, we'll be sorry not to have our own bows before long, I shouldn't wonder. Bit thin, too, those clothes of yours, are they?”

“Yes, I'm freezing already,” said Jill.

A few minutes ago when they had been in the kitchen, she had thought that if only they could once get out of the castle, their escape would be almost complete. She now realized that the most dangerous part of it was still to come.

“Steady, steady,” said Puddleglum. “Don't look back. Don't walk too quickly. Whatever you do, don't run. Look as if we were just taking a stroll, and then, if anyone sees us, he might, just possibly, not bother. The moment we look like people running away, we're done.”

The distance to the City Ruinous seemed longer than Jill would have believed possible. But bit by bit they were covering it. Then came a noise. The other two gasped. Jill, who didn't know what it was, said, “What's that?”

“Hunting horn,” whispered Scrubb.

“But don't run even now,” said Puddleglum. “Not until I give the word.”

This time Jill couldn't help glancing over her shoulder. There, about half a mile away, was the hunt returning from behind them on the left.

They walked on. Suddenly a great clamour of giant voices arose: then shouts and hollas.

“They've seen us. Run,” said Puddleglum.

Jill gathered up her long skirts—horrible things for running in—and ran. There was no mistaking the danger now. She could hear the music of the hounds. She could hear the King's voice roaring out, “After them, after them, or we'll have no man-pies tomorrow.”

She was last of the three now, cumbered with her dress, slipping on loose stones, her hair getting in her mouth, running—pains across her chest. The hounds were much nearer. Now she had to run uphill, up the stony slope which led to the lowest step of the giant stairway. She had no idea what they would do when they got there, or how they would be any better off even if they reached the top.

But she didn't think about that. She was like a hunted animal now; as long as the pack was after her, she must run till she dropped.

The Marsh-wiggle was ahead. As he came to the lowest step he stopped, looked a little to his right, and all of a sudden darted into a little hole or crevice at the bottom of it. His long legs, disappearing into it, looked very like those of a spider. Scrubb hesitated and then vanished after him. Jill, breathless and reeling, came to the place about a minute later. It was an unattractive hole—a crack between the earth and the stone about three feet long and hardly more than a foot high. You had to fling yourself flat on your face and crawl in. You couldn't do it so very quickly either. She felt sure that a dog's teeth would close on her heel before she had got inside.

“Quick, quick. Stones. Fill up the opening,” came Puddleglum's voice in the darkness beside her. It was pitch black in there, except for the grey light in the opening by which they had crawled in. The other two were working hard. She could see Scrubb's small hands and the Marshwiggle's big, frog-like hands black against the light, working desperately to pile up stones. Then she realized how important this was and began groping for large stones herself, and handing them to the others. Before the dogs were baying and yelping at the cave mouth, they had it pretty well filled; and now, of course, there was no light at all.

“Further in, quick,” said Puddleglum's voice.

“Let's all hold hands,” said Jill.

“Good idea,” said Scrubb. But it took them quite a long time to find one another's hands in the darkness. The dogs were sniffing at the other side of the barrier now.

“Try if we can stand up,” suggested Scrubb. They did and found that they could. Then, Puddleglum holding out a hand behind him to Scrubb, and Scrubb holding a hand out behind him to Jill (who wished very much that she was the middle one of the party and not the last), they began groping with their feet and stumbling forwards into the blackness. It was all loose stones underfoot. Then Puddleglum came up to a wall of rock. They turned a little to their right and went on. There were a good many more twists and turns. Jill had now no sense of direction at all, and no idea where the mouth of the cave lay.

“The question is,” came Puddleglum's voice out of the darkness ahead, “whether, taking one thing with another, it wouldn't be better to go back (if we can) and give the giants a treat at that feast of theirs, instead of losing our way in the guts of a hill where, ten to one, there's dragons and deep holes and gases and water and—Ow! Let go! Save yourselves. I'm—”

After that all happened quickly. There was a wild cry, a swishing, dusty, gravelly noise, a rattle of stones, and Jill found herself sliding, sliding, hopelessly sliding, and sliding quicker every moment down a slope that grew steeper every moment. It was not a smooth, firm slope, but a slope of small stones and rubbish. Even if you could have stood up, it would have been no use. Any bit of that slope you had put your foot on would have slid away from under you and carried you down with it. But Jill was more lying than standing. And the further they all slid, the more they disturbed all the stones and earth, so that the general downward rush of everything (including themselves) got faster and louder and dustier and dirtier. From the sharp cries and swearing of the other two, Jill got the idea that many of the stones which she was dislodging were hitting Scrubb and Puddleglum pretty hard. And now she was going at a furious rate and felt sure she would be broken to bits at the bottom.

Yet somehow they weren't. They were a mass of bruises, and the wet sticky stuff on her face appeared to be blood. And such a mass of loose earth, shingle, and larger stones was piled up round her (and partly over her) that she couldn't get up. The darkness was so complete that it made no difference at all whether you had your eyes open or shut. There was no noise. And that was the very worst moment Jill had ever known in her life. Supposing she was alone: supposing the others... Then she heard movements around her. And presently all three, in shaken voices, were explaining that none of them seemed to have any broken bones.

“We can never get up that again,” said Scrubb's voice.

“And have you noticed how warm it is?” said the voice of Puddleglum. “That means we're a long way down. Might be nearly a mile.”

No one said anything. Some time later Puddleglum added: “My tinder-box has gone.”

After another long pause Jill said, “I'm terribly thirsty.”

No one suggested doing anything. There was so obviously nothing to be done. For the moment, they did not feel it quite so badly as one might have expected; that was because they were so tired.

Long, long afterwards, without the slightest warning, an utterly strange voice spoke. They knew at once that it was not the one voice in the whole world for which each had secretly been hoping; the voice of Aslan. It was a dark, flat voice—almost, if you know what that means, a pitch-black voice. It said:

“What make you here, creatures of the Overworld?”





CHAPTER TEN: TRAVELS WITHOUT THE SUN


“WHO's there?” shouted the three travellers.

“I am the Warden of the Marches of Underland, and with me stand a hundred Earthmen in arms,” came the reply. “Tell me quickly who you are and what is your errand in the Deep Realm?”

“We fell down by accident,” said Puddleglum, truthfully enough.

“Many fall down, and few return to the sunlit lands,” said the voice. “Make ready now to come with me to the Queen of the Deep Realm.”

“What does she want with us?” asked Scrubb cautiously.

“I do not know,” said the voice. “Her will is not to be questioned but obeyed.”

While he said these words there was a noise like a soft explosion and immediately a cold light, grey with a little blue in it, flooded the cavern. All hope that the speaker had been idly boasting when he spoke of his hundred armed followers died at once. Jill found herself blinking and staring at a dense crowd. They were of all sizes, from little gnomes barely a foot high to stately figures taller than men. All carried three-pronged spears in their hands, and all were dreadfully pale, and all stood as still as statues. Apart from that, they were very different; some had tails and others not, some wore great beards and others had very round, smooth faces, big as pumpkins. There were long, pointed noses, and long, soft noses like small trunks, and great blobby noses. Several had single horns in the middle of their foreheads. But in one respect they were all alike: every face in the whole hundred was as sad as a face could be. They were so sad that, after the first glance, Jill almost forgot to be afraid of them. She felt she would like to cheer them up.

“Well!” said Puddleglum, rubbing his hands. “This is just what I needed. If these chaps don't teach me to take a serious view of life, I don't know what will. Look at that fellow with the walrus moustache—or that one with the—”

“Get up,” said the leader of the Earthmen.

There was nothing else to be done. The three travellers scrambled to their feet and joined hands. One wanted the touch of a friend's hand at a moment like that. And the Earthmen came all round them, padding on large, soft feet, on which some had ten toes, some twelve, and others none.

“March,” said the Warden: and march they did.

The cold light came from a large ball on the top of a long pole, and the tallest of the gnomes carried this at the head of the procession. By its cheerless rays they could see that they were in a natural cavern; the walls and roof were knobbed, twisted, and gashed into a thousand fantastic shapes, and the stony floor sloped downward as they proceeded. It was worse for Jill than for the others, because she hated dark, underground places. And when, as they went on, the cave got lower and narrower, and when, at last, the lightbearer stood aside, and the gnomes, one by one, stooped down (all except the very smallest ones) and stepped into a little dark crack and disappeared, she felt she could bear it no longer.

“I can't go in there, I can't! I can't! I won't,” she panted. The Earthmen said nothing but they all lowered their spears and pointed them at her.

“Steady, Pole,” said Puddleglum. “Those big fellows wouldn't be crawling in there if it didn't get wider later on. And there's one thing about this underground work, we shan't get any rain.”

“Oh, you don't understand. I can't,” wailed Jill.

“Think how 1 felt on that cliff, Pole,” said Scrubb. “You go first, Puddleglum, and I'll come after her.”

“That's right,” said the Marsh-wiggle, getting down on his hands and knees. “You keep a grip of my heels, Pole, and Scrubb will hold on to yours. Then we'll all be comfortable.”

“Comfortable!” said Jill. But she got down and they crawled in on their elbows. It was a nasty place. You had to go flat on your face for what seemed like half an hour, though it may really have been only five minutes. It was hot. Jill felt she was being smothered. But at last a dim light showed ahead, the tunnel grew wider and higher, and they came out, hot, dirty, and shaken, into a cave so large that it scarcely seemed like a cave at all.

It was full of a dim, drowsy radiance, so that here they had no need of the Earthmen's strange lantern. The floor was soft with some kind of moss and out of this grew many strange shapes, branched and tall like trees, but flabby like mushrooms. They stood too far apart to make a forest; it was more like a park. The light (a greenish grey) seemed to come both from them and from the moss, and it was not strong enough to reach the roof of the cave, which must have been a long way overhead. Across the mild, soft, sleepy place they were now made to march. It was very sad, but with a quiet sort of sadness like soft music.

Here they passed dozens of strange animals lying on the turf, either dead or asleep, Jill could not tell which. These were mostly of a dragonish or bat-like sort; Puddleglum did not know what any of them were.

“Do they grow here?” Scrubb asked the Warden. He seemed very surprised at being spoken to, but replied, “No. They are all beasts that have found their way down by chasms and caves, out of Overland into the Deep Realm. Many come down, and few return to the sunlit lands. It is said that they will all wake at the end of the world.”

His mouth shut like a box when he had said this, and in the great silence of that cave the children felt that they would not dare to speak again. The bare feet of the gnomes, padding on the deep moss, made no sound. There was no wind, there were no birds, there was no sound of water. There was no sound of breathing from the strange beasts.

When they had walked for several miles, they came to a wall of rock, and in it a low archway leading into another cavern. It was not, however, so bad as the last entrance and Jill could go through it without bending her head. It brought them into a smaller cave, long and narrow, about the shape and size of a cathedral. And here, filling almost the whole length of it, lay an enormous man fast asleep. He was far bigger than any of the giants, and his face was not like a giant's, but noble and beautiful. His breast rose and fell gently under the snowy beard which covered him to the waist. A pure, silver light (no one saw where it came from) rested upon him.

“Who's that?” asked Puddleglum. And it was so long since anyone had spoken, that Jill wondered how he had the nerve.

“That is old Father Time, who once was a King in Overland,” said the Warden. “And now he has sunk down into the Deep Realm and lies dreaming of all the things that are done in the upper world. Many sink down, and few return to the sunlit lands. They say he will wake at the end of the world.”

And out of that cave they passed into another, and then into another and another, and so on till Jill lost count, but always they were going downhill and each cave was lower than the last, till the very thought of the weight and depth of earth above you was suffocating. At last they came to a place where the Warden commanded his cheerless lantern to be lit again. Then they passed into a cave so wide and dark that they could see nothing of it except that right in front of them a strip of pale sand ran down into still water. And there, beside a little jetty, lay a ship without mast or sail but with many oars. They were made to go on board her and led forward to the bows where there was a clear space in front of the rowers' benches and a seat running round inside the bulwarks.

“One thing I'd like to know,” said Puddleglum, “is whether anyone from our world—from up-a-top, I mean—has ever done this trip before?”

“Many have taken ship at the pale beaches,” replied the Warden, “and—”

“Yes, I know,” interrupted Puddleglum. “And few return to the sunlit lands. You needn't say it again. You are a chap of one idea, aren't you?”

The children huddled close together on each side of Puddleglum. They had thought him a wet blanket while they were still above ground, but down here he seemed the only comforting thing they had. Then the pale lantern was hung up amidships, the Earthmen sat to the oars, and the ship began to move. The lantern cast its light only a very short way. Looking ahead, they could see nothing but smooth, dark water, fading into absolute blackness.

“Oh, whatever will become of us?” said Jill despairingly.

“Now don't you let your spirits down, Pole,” said the Marsh-wiggle. “There's one thing you've got to remember. We're back on the right lines. We were to go under the Ruined City, and we are under it. We're following the instructions again.”

Presently they were given food—flat, flabby cakes of some sort which had hardly any taste. And after that, they gradually fell asleep. But when they woke, everything was just the same; the gnomes still rowing, the ship still gliding on, still dead blackness ahead. How often they woke and slept and ate and slept again, none of them could ever remember. And the worst thing about it was that you began to feel as if you had always lived on that ship, in that darkness, and to wonder whether sun and blue skies and wind and birds had not been only a dream.

They had almost given up hoping or being afraid about anything when at last they saw lights ahead: dreary lights, like that of their own lantern. Then, quite suddenly, one of these lights came close and they saw that they were passing another ship. After that they met several ships. Then, staring till their eyes hurt, they saw that some of the lights ahead were shining on what looked like wharfs, walls, towers, and moving crowds. But still there was hardly any noise.

“By Jove,” said Scrubb. “A city!” and soon they all saw that he was right.

But it was a queer city. The lights were so few and far apart that they would hardly have done for scattered cottages in our world. But the little bits of the place which you could see by the lights were like glimpses of a great seaport. You could make out in one place a whole crowd of ships loading or unloading; in another, bales of stuff and warehouses; in a third, walls and pillars that suggested great palaces or temples; and always, wherever the light fell, endless crowds—hundreds of Earthmen, jostling one another as they padded softly about their business in narrow streets, broad squares, or up great flights of steps. Their continued movement made a sort of soft, murmuring noise as the ship drew nearer and nearer; but there was not a song or a shout or a bell or the rattle of a wheel anywhere. The City was as quiet, and nearly as dark, as the inside of an ant-hill.

At last their ship was brought alongside a quay and made fast. The three travellers were taken ashore and marched up into the City. Crowds of Earthmen, no two alike, rubbed shoulders with them in the crowded streets, and the sad light fell on many sad and grotesque faces. But no one showed any interest in the strangers. Every gnome seemed to be as busy as it was sad, though Jill never found what they were so busy about. But the endless moving, shoving, hurrying, and the soft pad-pad-pad went on.

At last they came to what appeared to be a great castle, though few of the windows in it were lighted. Here they were taken in and made to cross a courtyard, and to climb many staircases. This brought them in the end to a great murkily lit room. But in one corner of it—oh joy!—there was an archway filled with a quite different sort of light; the honest, yellowish, warm light of such a lamp as humans use. What showed by this light inside the archway was the foot of a staircase which wound upward between walls of stone. The light seemed to come from the top. Two Earthmen stood one on each side of the arch like sentries, or footmen.

The Warden went up to these two, and said, as if it were a password:

“Many sink down to the Underworld.”

“And few return to the sunlit lands,” they answered, as if it were the countersign. Then all three put their heads together and talked. At last one of the two gnomes-in-waiting said, “I tell you the Queen's grace is gone from hence on her great affair. We had best keep these top dwellers in strait prison till her homecoming. Few return to the sunlit lands.”

At that moment the conversation was interrupted by what seemed to Jill the most delightful noise in the world. It came from above, from the top of the staircase; and it was a clear, ringing, perfectly human voice, the voice of a young man.

“What coil are you keeping down there, Mullugutherum?” it shouted. “Overworlders, ha! Bring them up to me, and that presently.”

“Please it your Highness to remember,” began Mullugutherum, but the voice cut him short.

“It pleases my Highness principally to be obeyed, old mutterer. Bring them up,” it called.

Mullugutherum shook his head, motioned to the travellers to follow and began going up the staircase. At every step the light increased. There were rich tapestries hanging on the walls. The lamplight shone golden through thin curtains at the staircase-head.

The Earthmen parted the curtains and stood aside. The three passed in. They were in a beautiful room, richly tapestried, with a bright fire on a clean hearth, and red wine and cut glass sparkling on the table. A young man with fair hair rose to greet them. He was handsome and looked both bold and kind, though there was something about his face that didn't seem quite right. He was dressed in black and altogether looked a little bit like Hamlet.

“Welcome, Overworlders,” he cried. “But stay a moment! I cry you mercy! I have seen you two fair children, and this, your strange governor, before. Was it not you three that met me by the bridge on the borders of Ettinsmoor when I rode there by my Lady's side?”

“Oh... you were the black knight who never spoke?” exclaimed Jill.

“And was that lady the Queen of Underland?” asked Puddleglum, in no very friendly voice. And Scrubb, who was thinking the same, burst out, “Because if it was, I think she was jolly mean to send us off to a castle of giants who intended to eat us. What harm had we ever done her, I should like to know?”

“How?” said the Black Knight with a frown. “If you were not so young a warrior, Boy, you and I must have fought to the death on this quarrel. I can hear no words against my Lady's honour. But of this you may be assured, that whatever she said to you, she said of a good intent. You do not know her. She is a nosegay of all virtues, as truth, mercy, constancy, gentleness, courage, and the rest. I say what I know. Her kindness to me alone, who can in no way reward her, would make an admirable history. But you shall know and love her hereafter. Meanwhile, what is your errand in the Deep Lands?”

And before Puddleglum could stop her, Jill blurted out, “Please we are trying to find Prince Rilian of Narnia.” And then she realized what a frightful risk she had taken; these people might be enemies. But the Knight showed no interest.

“Rilian? Narnia?” he said carelessly. “Narnia? What land is that? I have never heard the name. It must be a thousand leagues from those parts of the Overworld that I know. But it was a strange fantasy that brought you seeking this—how do you call him?—Billian? Trillian? in my Lady's realm. Indeed, to my certain knowledge, there is no such man here.” He laughed very loudly at this, and Jill thought to herself, “I wonder is that what's wrong with his face? Is he a bit silly?”

“We had been told to look for a message on the stones of the City Ruinous,” said Scrubb. “And we saw the words UNDER ME.”

The Knight laughed even more heartily than before. “You were the more deceived,” he said. “Those words meant nothing to your purpose. Had you but asked my Lady, she could have given you better counsel. For those words are all that is left of a longer script, which in ancient times, as she well remembers, expressed this verse:

Though under Earth and throneless now I be,

Yet, while I lived, all Earth was under me.

From which it is plain that some great king of the ancient giants, who lies buried there, caused this boast to be cut in the stone over his sepulchre; though the breaking up of some stones, and the carrying away of others for new buildings, and the filling up of the cuts with rubble, has left only two words that can still be read. Is it not the merriest jest in the world that you should have thought they were written to you?”

This was like cold water down the back to Scrubb and Jill; for it seemed to them very likely that the words had nothing to do with their quest at all, and that they had been taken in by a mere accident.

“Don't you mind him,” said Puddleglum. “There are no accidents. Our guide is Aslan; and he was there when the giant King caused the letters to be cut, and he knew already all things that would come of them; including this.”

“This guide of yours must be a long liver, friend,” said the Knight with another of his laughs.

Jill began to find them a little irritating.

“And it seems to me, Sir,” answered Puddleglum, “that this Lady of yours must be a long liver too, if she remembers the verse as it was when they first cut it.”

“Very shrewd, Frog-face,” said the Knight, clapping Puddleglum on the shoulder and laughing again. “And you have hit the truth. She is of divine race, and knows neither age nor death. I am the more thankful to her for all her infinite bounty to such a poor mortal wretch as I. For you must know, Sirs, I am a man under most strange afflictions, and none but the Queen's grace would have had patience with me. Patience, said I? But it goes far beyond that. She has promised me a great kingdom in Overland, and, when I am king, her own most gracious hand in marriage. But the tale is too long for you to hear fasting and standing. Hi there, some of you! Bring wine and Updwellers' food for my guests. Please you, be seated, gentlemen. Little maiden, sit in this chair. You shall hear it all.”





CHAPTER ELEVEN: IN THE DARK CASTLE


WHEN the meal (which was pigeon pie, cold ham, salad, and cakes) had been brought, and all had drawn their chairs up to the table and begun, the Knight continued:

“You must understand, friends, that I know nothing of who I was and whence I came into this Dark World. I remember no time when I was not dwelling, as now, at the court of this all but heavenly Queen; but my thought is that she saved me from some evil enchantment and brought me hither of her exceeding bounty. (Honest Frogfoot, your cup is empty. Suffer me to refill it.) And this seems to me the likelier because even now I am bound by a spell, from which my Lady alone can free me. Every night there comes an hour when my mind is most horribly changed, and, after my mind, my body. For first I become furious and wild and would rush upon my dearest friends to kill them, if I were not bound. And soon after that, I turn into the likeness of a great serpent, hungry, fierce, and deadly. (Sir, be pleased to take another breast of pigeon, I entreat you.) So they tell me, and they certainly speak truth, for my Lady says the same. I myself know nothing of it, for when my hour is past I awake forgetful of all that vile fit and in my proper shape and sound mind—saving that I am somewhat wearied. (Little lady, eat one of these honey cakes, which are brought for me from some barbarous land in the far south of the world.) Now the Queen's majesty knows by her art that I shall be freed from this enchantment when once she has made me king of a land in the Overworld and set its crown upon my head. The land is already chosen and the very place of our breaking out. Her Earthmen have worked day and night digging a way beneath it, and have now gone so far and so high that they tunnel not a score of feet beneath the very grass on which the Updwellers of that country walk. It will be very soon now that those Uplanders' fate will come upon them. She herself is at the diggings tonight, and I expect a message to go to her. Then the thin roof of earth which still keeps me from my kingdom will be broken through, and with her to guide me and a thousand Earthmen at my back, I shall ride forth in arms, fall suddenly on our enemies, slay their chief men, cast down their strong places, and doubtless be their crowned king within four and twenty hours.”

“It's a bit rough luck on them, isn't it?” said Scrubb.

“Thou art a lad of a wondrous, quick-working wit!” exclaimed the Knight. “For, on my honour, I had never thought of it so before. I see your meaning.” He looked slightly, very slightly troubled for a moment or two; but his face soon cleared and he broke out, with another of his loud laughs, “But fie on gravity! Is it not the most comical and ridiculous thing in the world to think of them all going about their business and never dreaming that under their peaceful fields and floors, only a fathom down, there is a great army ready to break out upon them like a fountain! And they never to have suspected! Why, they themselves, when once the first smart of their defeat is over, can hardly choose but laugh at the thought!”

“I don't think it's funny at all,” said Jill. “I think you'll be a wicked tyrant.”

“What?” said the Knight, still laughing and patting her head in a quite infuriating fashion. “Is our little maid a deep politician? But never fear, sweetheart. In ruling that land, I shall do all by the counsel of my Lady, who will then be my Queen too. Her word shall be my law, even as my word will be law to the people we have conquered.”

“Where I come from,” said Jill, who was disliking him more every minute, “they don't think much of men who are bossed about by their wives.”

“Shalt think otherwise when thou hast a man of thine own, I warrant you,” said the Knight, apparently thinking this very funny. “But with my Lady, it is another matter. I am well content to live by her word, who has already saved me from a thousand dangers. No mother has taken pains more tenderly for her child, than the Queen's grace has for me. Why, look you, amid all her cares and business, she rideth out with me in the Overworld many a time and oft to accustom my eyes to the sunlight. And then I must go fully armed and with visor down, so that no man may see my face, and I must speak to no one. For she has found out by art magical that this would hinder my deliverance from the grievous enchantment I lie under. Is not that a lady worthy of a man's whole worship?”

“Sounds a very nice lady indeed,” said Puddleglum in a voice which meant exactly the opposite.

They were thoroughly tired of the Knight's talk before they had finished supper. Puddleglum was thinking, “I wonder what game that witch is really playing with this young fool.” Scrubb was thinking, “He's a great baby, really: tied to that woman's apron strings; he's a sap.” And Jill was thinking, “He's the silliest, most conceited, selfish pig I've met for a long time.” But when the meal was over, the Knight's mood had changed. There was no more laughter about him.

“Friends,” he said, “my hour is now very near. I am ashamed that you should see me yet I dread being left alone. They will come in presently and bind me hand and foot to yonder chair. Alas, so it must be: for in my fury, they tell me, I would destroy all that I could reach.”

“I say,” said Scrubb, “I'm awfully sorry about your enchantment of course, but what will those fellows do to us when they come to bind you? They talked of putting us in prison. And we don't like all those dark places very much. We'd much rather stay here till you're... better... if we may.”

“It is well thought of,” said the Knight. “By custom none but the Queen herself remains with me in my evil hour. Such is her tender care for my honour that she would not willingly suffer any ears but her own to hear the words I utter in that frenzy. But I could not easily persuade my attendant gnomes that you should be left with me. And I think I hear their soft feet even now upon the stairs. Go through yonder door: it leads into my other apartments. And there, either await my coming when they have unbound me; or, if you will, return and sit with me in my ravings.”

They followed his directions and passed out of the room by a door which they had not yet seen opened. It brought them, they were pleased to see, not into darkness but into a lighted corridor. They tried various doors and found (what they very badly needed) water for washing and even a looking glass. “He never offered us a wash before supper,” said Jill, drying her face. “Selfish, self-centred pig.”

“Are we going back to watch the enchantment, or shall we stay here?” said Scrubb.

“Stay here, I vote,” said Jill. “I'd much rather not see it.” But she felt a little inquisitive all the same.

“No, go back,” said Puddleglum. “We may pick up some information, and we need all we can get. I am sure that Queen is a witch and an enemy. And those Earthmen would knock us on the head as soon as look at us. There's a stronger smell of danger and lies and magic and treason about this land than I've ever smelled before. We need to keep our eyes and ears open.”

They went back down the corridor and gently pushed the door open. “It's all right,” said Scrubb, meaning that there were no Earthmen about. Then they all came back into the room where they had supped.

The main door was now shut, concealing the curtain between which they had first entered. The Knight was seated in a curious silver chair, to which he was bound by his ankles, his knees, his elbows, his wrists, and his waist. There was sweat on his forehead and his face was filled with anguish.

“Come in, friends,” he said, glancing quickly up. “The fit is not yet upon me. Make no noise, for I told that prying chamberlain that you were in bed. Now... I can feel it coming. Quick! Listen while I am master of myself. When the fit is upon me, it well may be that I shall beg and implore you, with entreaties and threatenings, to loosen my bonds. They say I do. I shall call upon you by all that is most dear and most dreadful. But do not listen to me. Harden your hearts and stop your ears. For while I am bound you are safe. But if once I were up and out of this chair, then first would come my fury, and after that”—he shuddered—“the change into a loathsome serpent.”

“There's no fear of our loosing you,” said Puddleglum. “We've no wish to meet wild men; or serpents either.”

“I should think not,” said Scrubb and Jill together.

“All the same,” added Puddleglum in a whisper. “Don't let's be too sure. Let's be on our guard. We've muffed everything else, you know. He'll be cunning, I shouldn't wonder, once he gets started. Can we trust one another? Do we all promise that whatever he says we don't touch those cords? Whatever he says, mind you?”

“Rather!” said Scrubb.

“There's nothing in the world he can say or do that'll make me change my mind,” said Jill.

“Hush! Something's happening,” said Puddleglum.

The Knight was moaning. His face was as pale as putty, and he writhed in his bonds. And whether because she was sorry for him, or for some other reason, Jill thought that he looked a nicer sort of man than he had looked before.

“Ah,” he groaned. “Enchantments, enchantments... the heavy, tangled, cold, clammy web of evil magic. Buried alive. Dragged down under the earth, down into the sooty blackness... how many years is it?... Have I lived ten years, or a thousand years, in the pit? Maggotmen all around me. Oh, have mercy. Let me out, let me go back. Let me feel the wind and see the sky... There used to be a little pool. When you looked down into it you could see all the trees growing upside-down in the water, all green, and below them, deep, very deep, the blue sky.”

He had been speaking in a low voice; now he looked up, fixed his eyes upon them, and said loud and clear:

“Quick! I am sane now. Every night I am sane. If only I could get out of this enchanted chair, it would last. I should be a man again. But every night they bind me, and so every night my chance is gone. But you are not enemies. I am not your prisoner. Quick! Cut these cords.”

“Stand fast! Steady,” said Puddleglum to the two children.

“I beseech you to hear me,” said the Knight, forcing himself to speak calmly. “Have they told you that if I am released from this chair I shall kill you and become a serpent? I see by your faces that they have. It is a lie. It is at this hour that I am in my right mind: it is all the rest of the day that I am enchanted. You are not Earthmen nor witches. Why should you be on their side? Of your courtesy, cut my bonds.”

“Steady! Steady! Steady!” said the three travellers to one another.

“Oh, you have hearts of stone,” said the Knight. “Believe me, you look upon a wretch who has suffered almost more than any mortal can bear. What wrong have I ever done you, that you should side with my enemies to keep me in such miseries? And the minutes are slipping past. Now you can save me; when this hour has passed, I shall be witless again—the toy and lap-dog, nay, more likely the pawn and tool, of the most devilish sorceress that ever planned the woe of men. And this night, of all nights, when she is away! You take from me a chance that may never come again.”

“This is dreadful. I do wish we'd stayed away till it was over,” said Jill.

“Steady!” said Puddleglum.

The prisoner's voice was now rising into a shriek. “Let me go, I say. Give me my sword. My sword! Once I am free I shall take such revenge on Earthmen that Underland will talk of it for a thousand years!”

“Now the frenzy is beginning,” said Scrubb. “I hope those knots are all right.”

“Yes,” said Puddleglum. “He'd have twice his natural strength if he got free now. And I'm not clever with my sword. He'd get us both, I shouldn't wonder; and then Pole on her own would be left to tackle the snake.”

The prisoner was now so straining at his bonds that they cut into his wrists and ankles. “Beware,” he said. “Beware. One night I did break them. But the witch was there that time. You will not have her to help you tonight. Free me now, and I am your friend. I'm your mortal enemy else.”

“Cunning, isn't he?” said Puddleglum.

“Once and for all,” said the prisoner, “I adjure you to set me free. By all fears and all loves, by the bright skies of Overland, by the great Lion, by Aslan himself, I charge you—”

“Oh!” cried the three travellers as though they had been hurt.

“It's the sign,” said Puddleglum.

“It was the words of the sign,” said Scrubb more cautiously.

“Oh, what are we to do?” said Jill.

It was a dreadful question. What had been the use of promising one another that they would not on any account set the Knight free, if they were now to do so the first time he happened to call upon a name they really cared about? On the other hand, what had been the use of learning the signs if they weren't going to obey them? Yet could Aslan have really meant them to unbind anyone—even a lunatic—who asked it in his name? Could it be a mere accident? Or how if the Queen of the Underworld knew all about the signs and had made the Knight learn this name simply in order to entrap them? But then, supposing this was the real sign?... They had muffed three already; they daren't muff the fourth.

“Oh, if only we knew!” said Jill.

“I think we do know,” said Puddleglum.

“Do you mean you think everything will come right if we do untie him?” said Scrubb.

“I don't know about that,” said Puddleglum. “You see, Aslan didn't tell Pole what would happen. He only told her what to do. That fellow will be the death of us once he's up, I shouldn't wonder. But that doesn't let us off following the sign.”

They all stood looking at one another with bright eyes. It was a sickening moment. “All right!” said Jill suddenly. “Let's get it over. Good-bye, everyone!” They all shook hands. The Knight was screaming by now; there was foam on his cheeks.

“Come on, Scrubb,” said Puddleglum. He and Scrubb drew their swords and went over to the captive.

“In the name of Aslan,” they said and began methodically cutting the cords. The instant the prisoner was free, he crossed the room in a single bound, seized his own sword (which had been taken from him and laid on the table), and drew it.

“You first!” he cried and fell upon the silver chair. That must have been a good sword. The silver gave way before its edge like string, and in a moment a few twisted fragments, shining on the floor, were all that was left. But as the chair broke, there came from it a bright flash, a sound like small thunder, and (for one moment) a loathsome smell.

“Lie there, vile engine of sorcery,” he said, “lest your mistress should ever use you for another victim.” Then he turned and surveyed his rescuers; and the something wrong, whatever it was, had vanished from his face.

“What?” he cried, turning to Puddleglum. “Do I see before me a Marsh-wiggle—a real, live, honest, Narnian Marsh-wiggle?”

“Oh, so you have heard of Narnia after all?” said Jill.

“Had I forgotten it when I was under the spell?” asked the Knight. “Well, that and all other bedevilments are now over. You may well believe that I know Narnia, for I am Rilian, Prince of Narnia, and Caspian the great King is my father.”

“Your Royal Highness,” said Puddleglum, sinking on one knee (and the children did the same), “we have come hither for no other end than to seek you.”

“And who are you, my other deliverers?” said the Prince to Scrubb and Jill.

“We were sent by Aslan himself from beyond the world's end to seek your Highness,” said Scrubb. “I am Eustace who sailed with him to the island of Ramandu.”

“I owe all three of you a greater debt than I can ever pay,” said Prince Rilian. “But my father? Is he yet alive?”

“He sailed east again before we left Narnia, my lord,” said Puddleglum. “But your Highness must consider that the King is very old. It is ten to one his Majesty must die on the voyage.”

“He is old, you say. How long then have I been in the power of the witch?'

“It is more than ten years since your Highness was lost in the woods at the north side of Narnia.”

“Ten years!” said the Prince, drawing his hand across his face as if to rub away the past. “Yes, I believe you. For now that I am myself I can remember that enchanted life, though while I was enchanted I could not remember my true self. And now, fair friends—but wait! I hear their feet (does it not sicken a man, that padding woolly tread! faugh!) on the stairs. Lock the door, boy. Or stay. I have a better thought than that. I will fool these Earthmen, if Aslan gives me the wit. Take your cue from me.”

He walked resolutely to the door and flung it wide open.





CHAPTER TWELVE: THE QUEEN OF UNDERLAND


TWO Earthmen entered, but instead of advancing into the room, they placed themselves one on each side of the door, and bowed deeply. They were followed immediately by the last person whom anyone had expected or wished to see: the Lady of the Green Kirtle, the Queen of Underland. She stood dead still in the doorway, and they could see her eyes moving as she took in the whole situation—the three strangers, the silver chair destroyed, and the Prince free, with his sword in his hand.

She turned very white; but Jill thought it was the sort of whiteness that comes over some people's faces not when they are frightened but when they are angry. For a moment the Witch fixed her eyes on the Prince, and there was murder in them. Then she seemed to change her mind.

“Leave us,” she said to the two Earthmen. “And let none disturb us till I call, on pain of death.” The gnomes padded away obediently, and the Witch-queen shut and locked the door.

“How now, my lord Prince,” she said. “Has your nightly fit not yet come upon you, or is it over so soon? Why stand you here unbound? Who are these aliens? And is it they who have destroyed the chair which was your only safety?”

Prince Rilian shivered as she spoke to him. And no wonder: it is not easy to throw off in half an hour an enchantment which has made one a slave for ten years. Then, speaking with a great effort, he said:

“Madam, there will be no more need of that chair. And you, who have told me a hundred times how deeply you pitied me for the sorceries by which I was bound, will doubtless hear with joy that they are now ended for ever. There was, it seems, some small error in your Ladyship's way of treating them. These, my true friends, have delivered me. I am now in my right mind, and there are two things I will say to you. First—as for your Ladyship's design of putting me at the head of an army of Earthmen so that I may break out into the Overworld and there, by main force, make myself king over some nation that never did me wrong—murdering their natural lords and holding their throne as a bloody and foreign tyrant—now that I know myself, I do utterly abhor and renounce it as plain villainy. And second: I am the King's son of Narnia, Rilian, the only child of Caspian, Tenth of that name, whom some call Caspian the Seafarer. Therefore, Madam, it is my purpose, as it is also my duty, to depart suddenly from your Highness's court into my own country. Please it you to grant me and my friends safe conduct and a guide through your dark realm.”

Now the Witch said nothing at all, but moved gently across the room, always keeping her face and eyes very steadily towards the Prince. When she had come to a little ark set in the wall not far from the fireplace, she opened it, and took out first a handful of a green powder. This she threw on the fire. It did not blaze much, but a very sweet and drowsy smell came from it. And all through the conversation which followed, that smell grew stronger, and filled the room, and made it harder to think. Secondly, she took out a musical instrument rather like a mandolin. She began to play it with her fingers—a steady, monotonous thrumming that you didn't notice after a few minutes. But the less you noticed it, the more it got into your brain and your blood. This also made it hard to think. After she had thrummed for a time (and the sweet smell was now strong) she began speaking in a sweet, quiet voice.

“Narnia?” she said. “Narnia? I have often heard your Lordship utter that name in your ravings. Dear Prince, you are very sick. There is no land called Narnia.”

“Yes there is, though, Ma'am,” said Puddleglum. “You see, I happen to have lived there all my life.”

“Indeed,” said the Witch. “Tell me, I pray you, where that country is?”

“Up there,” said Puddleglum, stoutly, pointing overhead. “I—I don't know exactly where.”

“How?” said the Queen, with a kind, soft, musical laugh. “Is there a country up among the stones and mortar of the roof?”

“No,” said Puddleglum, struggling a little to get his breath. “It's in Overworld.”

“And what, or where, pray is this... how do you call it... Overworld?”

“Oh, don't be so silly,” said Scrubb, who was fighting hard against the enchantment of the sweet smell and the thrumming. “As if you didn't know! It's up above, up where you can see the sky and the sun and the stars. Why, you've been there yourself. We met you there.”

“I cry you mercy, little brother,” laughed the Witch (you couldn't have heard a lovelier laugh). “I have no memory of that meeting. But we often meet our friends in strange places when we dream. And unless all dreamed alike, you must not ask them to remember it.”

“Madam,” said the Prince sternly, “I have already told your Grace that I am the King's son of Narnia.”

“And shalt be, dear friend,” said the Witch in a soothing voice, as if she was humouring a child, “shalt be king of many imagined lands in thy fancies.”

“We've been there, too,” snapped Jill. She was very angry because she could feel enchantment getting hold of her every moment. But of course the very fact that she could still feel it, showed that it had not yet fully worked.

“And thou art Queen of Narnia too, I doubt not, pretty one,” said the Witch in the same coaxing, half-mocking tone.

“I'm nothing of the sort,” said Jill, stamping her foot. “We come from another world.”

“Why, this is a prettier game than the other,” said the Witch. “Tell us, little maid, where is this other world? What ships and chariots go between it and ours?”

Of course a lot of things darted into Jill's head at once: Experiment House, Adela Pennyfather, her own home, radio-sets, cinemas, cars, aeroplanes, ration-books, queues. But they seemed dim and far away. (Thrum—thrum—thrum—went the strings of the Witch's instrument.) Jill couldn't remember the names of the things in our world. And this time it didn't come into her head that she was being enchanted, for now the magic was in its full strength; and of course, the more enchanted you get, the more certain you feel that you are not enchanted at all.

She found herself saying (and at the moment it was a relief to say): “No. I suppose that other world must be all a dream.”

“Yes. It is all a dream,” said the Witch, always thrumming.

“Yes, all a dream,” said Jill.

“There never was such a world,” said the Witch.

“No,” said Jill and Scrubb, “never was such a world.”

“There never was any world but mine,” said the Witch.

“There never was any world but yours,” said they.

Puddleglum was still fighting hard. “I don't know rightly what you all mean by a world,” he said, talking like a man who hasn't enough air. “But you can play that fiddle till your fingers drop off, and still you won't make me forget Narnia; and the whole Overworld too. We'll never see it again, I shouldn't wonder. You may have blotted it out and turned it dark like this, for all I know. Nothing more likely. But I know I was there once. I've seen the sky full of stars. I've seen the sun coming up out of the sea of a morning and sinking behind the mountains at night. And I've seen him up in the midday sky when I couldn't look at him for brightness.”

Puddleglum's words had a very rousing effect. The other three all breathed again and looked at one another like people newly awaked.

“Why, there it is!” cried the Prince. “Of course! The blessing of Aslan upon this honest Marsh-wiggle. We have all been dreaming, these last few minutes. How could we have forgotten it? Of course we've all seen the sun.”

“By Jove, so we have!” said Scrubb. “Good for you, Puddleglum! You're the only one of us with any sense, I do believe.”

Then came the Witch's voice, cooing softly like the voice of a wood-pigeon from the high elms in an old garden at three o'clock in the middle of a sleepy, summer afternoon; and it said:

“What is this sun that you all speak of? Do you mean anything by the word?”

“Yes, we jolly well do,” said Scrubb.

“Can you tell me what it's like?” asked the Witch (thrum, thrum, thrum, went the strings).

“Please it your Grace,” said the Prince, very coldly and politely. “You see that lamp. It is round and yellow and gives light to the whole room; and hangeth moreover from the roof. Now that thing which we call the sun is like the lamp, only far greater and brighter. It giveth light to the whole Overworld and hangeth in the sky.”

“Hangeth from what, my lord?” asked the Witch; and then, while they were all still thinking how to answer her, she added, with another of her soft, silver laughs: “You see? When you try to think out clearly what this sun must be, you cannot tell me. You can only tell me it is like the lamp. Your sun is a dream; and there is nothing in that dream that was not copied from the lamp. The lamp is the real thing; the sun is but a tale, a children's story.”

“Yes, I see now,” said Jill in a heavy, hopeless tone. “It must be so.” And while she said this, it seemed to her to be very good sense.

Slowly and gravely the Witch repeated, “There is no sun.” And they all said nothing. She repeated, in a softer and deeper voice. “There is no sun.” After a pause, and after a struggle in their minds, all four of them said together. “You are right. There is no sun.” It was such a relief to give in and say it.

“There never was a sun,” said the Witch.

“No. There never was a sun,” said the Prince, and the Marsh-wiggle, and the children.

For the last few minutes Jill had been feeling that there was something she must remember at all costs. And now she did. But it was dreadfully hard to say it. She felt as if huge weights were laid on her lips. At last, with an effort that seemed to take all the good out of her, she said:

“There's Aslan.”

“Aslan?” said the Witch, quickening ever so slightly the pace of her thrumming. “What a pretty name! What does it mean?”

“He is the great Lion who called us out of our own world,” said Scrubb, “and sent us into this to find Prince Rilian.”

“What is a lion?” asked the Witch.

“Oh, hang it all!” said Scrubb. “Don't you know? How can we describe it to her? Have you ever seen a cat?”

“Surely,” said the Queen. “I love cats.”

“Well, a lion is a little bit—only a little bit, mind you—like a huge cat—with a mane. At least, it's not like a horse's mane, you know, it's more like a judge's wig. And it's yellow. And terrifically strong.”

The Witch shook her head. “I see,” she said, “that we should do no better with your lion, as you call it, than we did with your sun. You have seen lamps, and so you imagined a bigger and better lamp and called it the sun. You've seen cats, and now you want a bigger and better cat, and it's to be called a lion. Well, 'tis a pretty makebelieve, though, to say truth, it would suit you all better if you were younger. And look how you can put nothing into your make-believe without copying it from the real world, this world of mine, which is the only world. But even you children are too old for such play. As for you, my lord Prince, that art a man full grown, fie upon you! Are you not ashamed of such toys? Come, all of you. Put away these childish tricks. I have work for you all in the real world. There is no Narnia, no Overworld, no sky, no sun, no Aslan. And now, to bed all. And let us begin a wiser life tomorrow. But, first, to bed; to sleep; deep sleep, soft pillows, sleep without foolish dreams.”

The Prince and the two children were standing with their heads hung down, their cheeks flushed, their eyes half closed; the strength all gone from them; the enchantment almost complete. But Puddleglum, desperately gathering all his strength, walked over to the fire. Then he did a very brave thing. He knew it wouldn't hurt him quite as much as it would hurt a human; for his feet (which were bare) were webbed and hard and coldblooded like a duck's. But he knew it would hurt him badly enough; and so it did. With his bare foot he stamped on the fire, grinding a large part of it into ashes on the flat hearth. And three things happened at once.

First, the sweet heavy smell grew very much less. For though the whole fire had not been put out, a good bit of it had, and what remained smelled very largely of burnt Marshwiggle, which is not at all an enchanting smell. This instantly made everyone's brain far clearer. The Prince and the children held up their heads again and opened their eyes.

Secondly, the Witch, in a loud, terrible voice, utterly different from all the sweet tones she had been using up till now, called out, “What are you doing? Dare to touch my fire again, mud-filth, and I'll turn the blood to fire inside your veins.”

Thirdly, the pain itself made Puddleglum's head for a moment perfectly clear and he knew exactly what he really thought. There is nothing like a good shock of pain for dissolving certain kinds of magic.

“One word, Ma'am,” he said, coming back from the fire; limping, because of the pain. “One word. All you've been saying is quite right, I shouldn't wonder. I'm a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won't deny any of what you said. But there's one thing more to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things—trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a playworld which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia. So, thanking you kindly for our supper, if these two gentlemen and the young lady are ready, we're leaving your court at once and setting out in the dark to spend our lives looking for Overland. Not that our lives will be very long, I should think; but that's a small loss if the world's as dull a place as you say.”

“Oh, hurray! Good old Puddleglum!” cried Scrubb and Jill.

But the Prince shouted suddenly, “'Ware! Look to the Witch.”

When they did look their hair nearly stood on end.

The instrument dropped from her hands. Her arms appeared to be fastened to her sides. Her legs were intertwined with each other, and her feet had disappeared. The long green train of her skirt thickened and grew solid, and seemed to be all one piece with the writhing green pillar of her interlocked legs. And that writhing green pillar was curving and swaying as if it had no joints, or else were all joints. Her head was thrown far back and while her nose grew longer and longer, every other part of her face seemed to disappear, except her eyes. Huge flaming eyes they were now, without brows or lashes. All this takes time to write down; it happened so quickly that there was only just time to see it. Long before there was time to do anything, the change was complete, and the great serpent which the Witch had become, green as poison, thick as Jill's waist, had flung two or three coils of its loathsome body round the Prince's legs. Quick as lightning another great loop darted round, intending to pinion his swordarm to his side. But the Prince was just in time. He raised his arms and got them clear: the living knot closed only round his chest—ready to crack his ribs like firewood when it drew tight.

The Prince caught the creature's neck in his left hand, trying to squeeze it till it choked. This held its face (if you could call it a face) about five inches from his own. The forked tongue flickered horribly in and out, but could not reach him. With his right hand he drew back his sword for the strongest blow he could give. Meanwhile Scrubb and Puddleglum had drawn their weapons and rushed to his aid. All three blows fell at once: Scrubb's (which did not even pierce the scales and did no good) on the body of the snake below the Prince's hand, but the Prince's own blow and Puddleglum's both on its neck. Even that did not quite kill it, though it began to loosen its hold on Rilian's legs and chest. With repeated blows they hacked off its head. The horrible thing went on coiling and moving like a bit of wire long after it had died; and the floor, as you may imagine, was a nasty mess.

The Prince, when he had breath, said, “Gentlemen, I thank you.” Then the three conquerors stood staring at one another and panting, without another word, for a long time. Jill had very wisely sat down and was keeping quiet; she was saying to herself, “I do hope I don't faint—or blub—or do anything idiotic.”

“My royal mother is avenged,” said Rilian presently. “This is undoubtedly the same worm that I pursued in vain by the fountain in the forest of Narnia, so many years ago. All these years I have been the slave of my mother's slayer. Yet I am glad, gentlemen, that the foul Witch took to her serpent form at the last. It would not have suited well either with my heart or with my honour to have slain a woman. But look to the lady.” He meant Jill.

“I'm all right, thanks,” said she.

“Damsel,” said the Prince, bowing to her. “You are of a high courage, and therefore, I doubt not, you come of a noble blood in your own world. But come, friends. Here is some wine left. Let us refresh ourselves and each pledge his fellows. After that, to our plans.”

“A jolly good idea, Sir,” said Scrubb.





CHAPTER THIRTEEN: UNDERLAND WITHOUT THE QUEEN


ALL felt that they had earned what Scrubb called a “breather”. The Witch had locked the door and told the Earthmen not to disturb her, so there was no danger of interruption forthe present. Their first business was, of course, Puddleglum's burnt foot. A couple ofclean shirts from the Prince's bedroom, torn into strips, and well greased on the insidewith butter and salad oil off the supper table, made a fairly good dressing. When this hadbeen applied, they all sat down and had a little refreshment, and discussed plans forescaping from the Underworld.

Rilian explained that there were quite a lot of outlets by which one could get to the surface—he had been taken out through most of them at one time or another. But he had never gone out alone, only with the Witch; and he had always reached these outlets by going in a ship across the Sunless Sea. What the Earthmen would say if he went down to the harbour without the Witch, and with four strangers, and simply ordered a ship, no one could guess. But most likely they would ask awkward questions. On the other hand the new outlet, the one for the invasion of Overworld, was on this side of the sea, and only a few miles away. The Prince knew that it was nearly finished; only a few feet of earth divided the diggings from the outer air. It was even possible that it had now been quite finished. Perhaps the Witch had come back to tell him this and to start the attack. Even if it was not, they could probably dig themselves out by that route in a few hours—if they could only get there without being stopped, and if only they found the diggings unguarded. But those were the difficulties.

“If you ask me—” began Puddleglum, when Scrubb interrupted.

“I say,” he asked, “what's that noise?”

“I've been wondering that for some time!” said Jill.

They had all, in fact, been hearing the noise but it had begun and increased so gradually that they did not know when they had first noticed it. For a time it had been only a vague disquiet like gentle winds, or traffic very far away. Then it swelled to a murmur like the sea. Then came rumblings and rushings. Now there seemed to be voices as well and also a steady roaring that was not voices.

“By the Lion,” said Prince Rilian, “it seems this silent land has found a tongue at last.” He rose, walked to the window, and drew aside the curtains. The others crowded round him to look out.

The very first thing they noticed was a great red glow. Its reflection made a red patch on the roof of the Underworld thousands of feet above them, so that they could see a rocky ceiling which had perhaps been hidden in darkness ever since the world was made. The glow itself came from the far side of the city so that many buildings, grim and great, stood up blackly against it. But it also cast its light down many streets that ran from it towards the castle. And in those streets something very strange was going on. The closely-packed, silent crowds of Earthmen had vanished. Instead, there were figures darting about by ones, or twos, or threes. They behaved like people who do not want to be seen: lurking in shadow behind buttresses or in doorways, and then moving quickly across the open into fresh places of hiding. But the strangest thing of all, to anyone who knew the gnomes, was the noise. Shouts and cries came from all directions. But from the harbour there came a low, rumbling roar which grew steadily louder and was already shaking the whole city.

“What's happened to the Earthmen?” said Scrubb. “Is it them shouting?”

“'Tis hardly possible,” said the Prince. “I never heard one of the rascals so much as speak with a loud voice in all the weary years of my bondage. Some new devilry, I don't doubt.”

“And what is that red light over there?” asked Jill. “Is something on fire?”

“If you ask me,” said Puddleglum, “I should say that was the central fires of the Earth breaking out to make a new volcano. We'll be in the middle of it, I shouldn't wonder.”

“Look at that ship!” said Scrubb. “Why's it coming on so quickly? No one's rowing it.”

“Look, look!” said the Prince. “The ship is already far this side of the harbour—it is in the street. Look! All the ships are driving into the city! By my head, the sea's rising. The flood is upon us. Aslan be praised, this castle stands on high ground. But the water comes on grimly fast.”

“Oh, what can be happening?” cried Jill. “Fire and water and all those people dodging about the streets.”

“I'll tell you what it is,” said Puddleglum. “That Witch has laid a train of magic spells so that whenever she was killed, at that same moment her whole kingdom would fall to pieces. She's the sort that wouldn't so much mind dying herself if she knew that the chap who killed her was going to be burned, or buried, or drowned five minutes later.”

“Hast hit it, friend wiggle,” said the Prince. “When our swords hacked off the Witch's head, that stroke ended all her magic works, and now the Deep Lands are falling to pieces. We are looking on the end of Underworld.”

“That's it, Sir,” said Puddleglum. “Unless it should happen to be the end of the whole world.”

“But are we just going to stay here and—wait?” gasped Jill.

“Not by my counsel,” said the Prince. “I would save my horse, Coalblack, and the Witch's Snowflake (a noble beast and worthy of a better mistress) which are both stabled in the courtyard. After that, let us make shift to get out to high ground and pray that we shall find an outlet. The horses can carry two each at need, and if we put them to it they may outstrip the flood.”

“Will your Highness not put on armour?” asked Puddleglum. “I don't like the look of those”—and he pointed down to the street. Everyone looked down. Dozens of creatures (and now that they were close, they obviously were Earthmen) were coming up from the direction of the harbour. But they were not moving like an aimless crowd. They behaved like modern soldiers in an attack, making rushes and taking cover, anxious not to be seen from the castle windows.

“I dare not see the inside of that armour again,” said the Prince. “I rode in it as in a movable dungeon, and it stinks of magic and slavery. But I will take the shield.”

He left the room and returned with a strange light in his eyes a moment later.

“Look, friends,” he said, holding out the shield towards them. “An hour ago it was black and without device; and now, this.” The shield had turned bright as silver, and on it, redder than blood or cherries, was the figure of the Lion.

“Doubtless,” said the Prince, “this signifies that Aslan will be our good lord, whether he means us to live or die. And all's one, for that. Now, by my counsel, we shall all kneel and kiss his likeness, and then all shake hands one with another, as true friends that may shortly be parted. And then, let us descend into the city and take the adventure that is sent us.”

And they all did as the Prince had said. But when Scrubb shook hands with Jill, he said, “So long, Jill. Sorry I've been a funk and so ratty. I hope you get safe home,” and Jill said, “So long, Eustace. And I'm sorry I've been such a pig.” And this was the first time they had ever used Christian names, because one didn't do it at school.

The Prince unlocked the door and they all went down the stairs: three of them with drawn swords, and Jill with drawn knife. The attendants had vanished and the great room at the foot of the Prince's stairs was empty. The grey, doleful lamps were still burning and by their light they had no difficulty in passing gallery after gallery and descending stairway after stairway. The noises from outside the castle were not so easily heard here as they had been in the room above. Inside the house all was still as death, and deserted. It was as they turned a corner into the great hall on the ground floor that they met their first Earthman—a fat, whitish creature with a very pig-like face who was gobbling up all the remains of food on the tables. It squealed (the squeal also was very like a pig's) and darted under a bench, whisking its long tail out of Puddleglum's reach in the nick of time. Then it rushed away through the far door too quickly to be followed.

From the hall they came out into the courtyard. Jill, who went to a riding school in the holidays, had just noticed the smell of a stable (a very nice, honest, homely smell it is to meet in a place like Underland) when Eustace said, “Great Scott! Look at that!” A magnificent rocket had risen from somewhere beyond the castle walls and broken into green stars.

“Fireworks!” said Jill in a puzzled voice.

“Yes,” said Eustace, “but you can't imagine those Earth people letting them off for fun! It must be a signal.”

“And means no good to us, I'll be bound,” said Puddleglum.

“Friends,” said the Prince, “when once a man is launched on such an adventure as this, he must bid farewell to hopes and fears, otherwise death or deliverance will both come too late to save his honour and his reason. Ho, my beauties” (he was now opening the stable door). “Hey cousins! Steady, Coalblack! Softly now, Snowflake! You are not forgotten.”

The horses were both frightened by the strange lights and the noises. Jill, who had been so cowardly about going through a black hole betweeen one cave and another, went in without fear between the stamping and snorting beasts, and she and the Prince had them saddled and bridled in a few minutes. Very fine they looked as they came out into the courtyard, tossing their heads. Jill mounted Snowflake, and Puddleglum got up behind her. Eustace got up behind the Prince on Coalblack. Then with a great echo of hoofs, they rode out of the main gateway into the street.

“Not much danger of being burnt. That's the bright side of it,” observed Puddleglum, pointing to their right. There, hardly a hundred yards away, lapping against the walls of the houses, was water.

“Courage!” said the Prince. “The road there goes down steeply. That water has climbed only half up the greatest hill in the city. It might come so near in the first half-hour and come no nearer in the next two. My fear is more of that—” and he pointed with his sword to a great tall Earthman with boar's tusks, followed by six others of assorted shapes and sizes who had just dashed out of a side street and stepped into the shadow of the houses where no one could see them.

The Prince led them, aiming always in the direction of the glowing red light but a little to the left of it. His plan was to get round the fire (if it was a fire) on to high ground, in hope that they might find their way to the new diggings. Unlike the other three, he seemed to be almost enjoying himself. He whistled as he rode, and sang snatches of an old song about Corin Thunder-fist of Archenland. The truth is, he was so glad at being free from his long enchantment that all dangers seemed a game in comparison. But the rest found it an eerie journey.

Behind them was the sound of clashing and entangled ships, and the rumble of collapsing buildings. Overhead was the great patch of lurid light on the roof of the Underworld. Ahead was the mysterious glow, which did not seem to grow any bigger. From the same direction came a continual hubbub of shouts, screams, cat-calls, laughter, squeals, and bellowings; and fireworks of all sorts rose in the dark air. No one could guess what they meant. Nearer to them, the city was partly lit up by the red glow, and partly by the very different light of the dreary Gnome lamps. But there were many places where neither of these lights fell, and those places were jet-black. And in and out of those places the shapes of Earthmen were darting and slipping all the time, always with their eyes fixed on the travellers, always trying to keep out of sight themselves. There were big faces and little faces, huge eyes like fishes' eyes and little eyes like bears'. There were feathers and bristles, horns and tusks, noses like whipcord, and chins so long that they looked like beards. Every now and then a group of them would get too big or come too near. Then the Prince would brandish his sword and make a show of charging them. And the creatures, with all manner of hootings, squeakings, and cluckings, would dive away into the darkness.

But when they had climbed many steep streets and were far away from the flood, and almost out of the town on the inland side, it began to be more serious. They were now close to the red glow and nearly on a level with it, though they still could not see what it really was. But by its light they could see their enemies more clearly. Hundreds—perhaps a few thousands—of gnomes were all moving towards it. But they were doing so in short rushes, and whenever they stopped, they turned and faced the travellers.

“If your Highness asked me,” said Puddleglum, “I'd say those fellows were meaning to cut us off in front.”

“That was my thought too, Puddleglum,” said the Prince. “And we can never fight our way through so many. Hark you! Let us ride forth close by the edge of yonder house. And even as we reach it, do you slip off into its shadow. The Lady and I will go forward a few paces. Some of these devils will follow us, I doubt not; they are thick behind us. Do you, who have long arms, take one alive if you may, as it passes your ambush. We may get a true tale of it or learn what is their quarrel against us.”

“But won't the others all come rushing at us to rescue the one we catch,” said Jill in a voice not so steady as she tried to make it.

“Then, Madam,” said the Prince, “you shall see us die fighting around you, and you must commend yourself to the Lion. Now, good Puddleglum.”

The Marsh-wiggle slipped off into the shadow as quickly as a cat. The others, for a sickening minute or so, went forward at a walk. Then suddenly from behind them there broke out a series of blood-curdling screams, mixed with the familiar voice of Puddleglum, saying, “Now then! Don't cry out before you're hurt, or you will be hurt, see? Anyone would think it was a pig being killed.”

“That was good hunting,” exclaimed the Prince, immediately turning Coalblack and coming back to the corner of the house. “Eustace,” he said, “of your courtesy, take Coalblack's head.” Then he dismounted, and all three gazed in silence while Puddleglum pulled his catch out into the light. It was a most miserable little gnome, only about three feet long. It had a sort of ridge, like a cock's comb (only hard), on the top of its head, little pink eyes, and a mouth and chin so large and round that its face looked like that of a pigmy hippopotamus. If they had not been in such a tight place, they would have burst into laughter at the sight of it.

“Now, Earthman,” said the Prince, standing over it and holding his sword point very near the prisoner's neck, “speak, up, like an honest gnome, and you shall go free. Play the knave with us, and you are but a dead Earthman. Good Puddleglum, how can it speak while you hold its mouth tight shut?”

“No, and it can't bite either,” said Puddleglum. “If I had the silly soft hands that you humans have (saving your Highness's reverence) I'd have been all over blood by now. Yet even a Marsh-wiggle gets tired of being chewed.”

“Sirrah,” said the Prince to the gnome, “one bite and you die. Let its mouth open, Puddleglum.”

“Oo-ee-ee,” squealed the Earthman, “let me go, let me go. It isn't me. I didn't do it.”

“Didn't do what?” asked Puddleglum.

“Whatever your Honours say I did do,” answered the creature.

“Tell me your name,” said the Prince, “and what you Earthmen are all about today.”

“Oh please, your Honours, please, kind gentlemen,” whimpered the gnome. “Promise you will not tell the Queen's grace anything I say.”

“The Queen's grace, as you call her,” said the Prince sternly, “is dead. I killed her myself.”

“What!” cried the gnome, opening its ridiculous mouth wider and wider in astonishment. “Dead? The Witch dead? And by your Honour's hand?” It gave a huge sigh of relief and added, “Why, then your Honour is a friend!”

The Prince withdrew his sword an inch or so. Puddleglum let the creature sit up. It looked round on the four travellers with its twinkling, red eyes, chuckled once or twice, and began.





CHAPTER FOURTEEN: THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD


“MY name is Golg,” said the gnome. “And I'll tell your Honours all I know. About an hour ago we were all going about our work—her work, I should say—sad and silent, same as we've done any other day for years and years. Then there came a great crash and bang. As soon as they heard it, everyone says to himself, I haven't had a song or a dance or let off a squib for a long time; why's that? And everyone thinks to himself, Why, I must have been enchanted. And then everyone says to himself, I'm blessed if I know why I'm carrying this load, and I'm not going to carry it any further: that's that. And down we all throw our sacks and bundles and tools. Then everyone turns and sees the great red glow over yonder. And everyone says to himself, What's that? and everyone answers himself and says, There's a crack or chasm split open and a nice warm glow coming up through it from the Really Deep Land, a thousand fathom under us.”

“Great Scott,” exclaimed Eustace, “are there other lands still lower down?”

“Oh yes, your Honour,” said Golg. “Lovely places; what we call the Land of Bism. This country where we are now, the Witch's country, is what we call the Shallow Lands. It's a good deal too near the surface to suit us. Ugh! You might almost as well be living outside, on the surface itself. You see, we're all poor gnomes from Bism whom the Witch has called up here by magic to work for her. But we'd forgotten all about it till that crash came and the spell broke. We didn't know who we were or where we belonged. We couldn't do anything, or think anything, except what she put into our heads. And it was glum and gloomy things she put there all those years. I've nearly forgotten how to make a joke or dance a jig. But the moment the bang came and the chasm opened and the sea began rising, it all came back. And of course we all set off as quick as we could to get down the crack and home to our own place. And you can see them over there all letting off rockets and standing on their heads for joy. And I'll be very obliged to your Honours if you'll soon let me go and join in.”

“I think this is simply splendid,” said Jill. “I'm so glad we freed the gnomes as well as ourselves when we cut off the Witch's head! And I'm so glad they aren't really horrid and gloomy any more than the Prince really was—well, what he seemed like.”

“That's all very well, Pole,” said Puddleglum cautiously. “But those gnomes didn't look to me like chaps who were just running away. It looked more like military formations, if you ask me. Do you look me in the face, Mr Golg, and tell me you weren't preparing for battle?”

“Of course we were, your Honour,” said Golg. “You see, we didn't know the Witch was dead. We thought she'd be watching from the castle. We were trying to slip away without being seen. And then when you three came out with swords and horses, of course everyone says to himself, Here it comes: not knowing that his Honour wasn't on the Witch's side. And we were determined to fight like anything rather than give up the hope of going back to Bism.”

“I'll be sworn 'tis an honest gnome,” said the Prince. “Let go of it, friend Puddleglum. As for me, good Golg, I have been enchanted like you and your fellows, and have but newly remembered myself. And now, one question more. Do you know the way to those new diggings, by which the sorceress meant to lead out an army against Overland?”

“Ee-ee-ee!” squeaked Golg. “Yes, I know that terrible road. I will show you where it begins. But it is no manner of use your Honour asking me to go with you on it. I'll die rather.”

“Why?” asked Eustace anxiously. “What's so dreadful about it?”

“Too near the top, the outside,” said Golg, shuddering. “That was the worst thing the Witch did to us. We were going to be led out into the open—on to the outside of the world. They say there's no roof at all there; only a horrible great emptiness called the sky. And the diggings have gone so far that a few strokes of the pick would bring you out to it. I wouldn't dare go near them.”

“Hurrah! Now you're talking!” cried Eustace, and Jill said, “But it's not horrid at all up there. We like it. We live there.”

“I know you Overlanders live there,” said Golg. “But I thought it was because you couldn't find your way down inside. You can't really like it—crawling about like flies on the top of the world!”

“What about showing us the road at once?” said Puddleglum.

“In a good hour,” cried the Prince. The whole party set out. The Prince remounted his charger, Puddleglum climbed up behind Jill, and Golg led the way. As he went, he kept shouting out the good news that the Witch was dead and that the four Overlanders were not dangerous. And those who heard him shouted it on to others, so that in a few minutes the whole of Underland was ringing with shouts and cheers, and gnomes by hundreds and thousands, leaping, turning cart-wheels, standing on their heads, playing leap-frog, and letting off huge crackers, came pressing round Coalblack and Snowflake. And the Prince had to tell the story of his own enchantment and deliverance at least ten times.

In this way they came to the edge of the chasm. It was about a thousand feet long and perhaps two hundred wide. They dismounted from their horses and came to the edge, and looked down into it. A strong heat smote up into their faces, mixed with a smell which was quite unlike any they had ever smelled. It was rich, sharp, exciting, and made you sneeze. The depth of the chasm was so bright that at first it dazzled their eyes and they could see nothing. When they got used to it they thought they could make out a river of fire, and, on the banks of that river, what seemed to be fields and groves of an unbearable, hot brilliance—though they were dim compared with the river. There were blues, reds, greens, and whites all jumbled together: a very good stained-glass window with the tropical sun staring straight through it at midday might have something the same effect. Down the rugged sides of the chasm, looking black like flies against all that fiery light, hundreds of Earthmen were climbing.

“Your honours,” said Golg (and when they turned to look at him they could see nothing but blackness for a few minutes, their eyes were so dazzled). “Your honours, why don't you come down to Bism? You'd be happier there than in that cold, unprotected, naked country out on top. Or at least come down for a short visit.”

Jill took it for granted that none of the others would listen to such an idea for a moment. To her horror she heard the Prince saying:

“Truly, friend Golg, I have half a mind to come down with you. For this is a marvellous adventure, and it may be no mortal man has ever looked into Bism before or will ever have the chance again. And I know not how, as the years pass, I shall bear to remember that it was once in my power to have probed the uttermost pit of Earth and that I forbore. But could a man live there? You do not swim in the fire-river itself?”

“Oh no, your Honour. Not we. It's only salamanders live in the fire itself.”

“What kind of beast is your salamander?” asked the Prince.

“It is hard to tell their kind, your Honour,” said Golg. “For they are too white-hot to look at. But they are most like small dragons. They speak to us out of the fire. They are wonderfully clever with their tongues: very witty and eloquent.”

Jill glanced hastily at Eustace. She had felt sure that he would like the idea of sliding down that chasm even less than she did. Her heart sank as she saw that his face was quite changed. He looked much more like the Prince than like the old Scrubb at Experiment House. For all his adventures, and the days when he had sailed with King Caspian, were coming back to him.

“Your Highness,” he said. “If my old friend Reepicheep the Mouse were here, he would say we could not now refuse the adventures of Bism without a great impeachment to our honour.”

“Down there,” said Golg, “I could show you real gold, real silver, real diamonds.”

“Bosh!” said Jill rudely. “As if we didn't know that we're below the deepest mines even here.”

“Yes,” said Golg. “I have heard of those little scratches in the crust that you Topdwellers call mines. But that's where you get dead gold, dead silver, dead gems. Down in Bism we have them alive and growing. There I'll pick you bunches of rubies that you can eat and squeeze you a cup full of diamond-juice. You won't care much about fingering the cold, dead treasures of your shallow mines after you have tasted the live ones of Bism.”

“My father went to the world's end,” said Rilian thoughtfully. “It would be a marvellous thing if his son went to the bottom of the world.”

“If your Highness wants to see your father while he's still alive, which I think he'd prefer,” said Puddleglum, “it's about time we were getting on to that road to the diggings.”

“And I won't go down that hole, whatever anyone says,” added Jill.

“Why, if your Honours are really set to go back to Overworld,” said Golg, “there is one bit of the road that's rather lower than this. And perhaps, if that flood's still rising—”

“Oh, do, do, do come on!” begged Jill.

“I fear it must be so,” said the Prince with a deep sigh. “But I have left half of my heart in the land of Bism.”

“Please!” begged Jill.

“Where is the road?” asked Puddleglum.

“There are lamps all the way,” said Golg. “Your Honour can see the beginning of the road on the far side of the chasm.”

“How long will the lamps burn for?” asked Puddleglum.

At that moment a hissing, scorching voice like the voice of Fire itself (they wondered afterwards if it could have been a salamander's) came whistling up out of the very depths of Bism.

“Quick! Quick! Quick! To the cliffs, to the cliffs, to the cliffs!” it said. “The rift closes. It closes. It closes. Quick! Quick!” And at the same time, with ear-shattering cracks and creaks, the rocks moved. Already, while they looked, the chasm was narrower. From every side belated gnomes were rushing into it. They would not wait to climb down the rocks. They flung themselves headlong and, either because so strong a blast of hot air was beating up from the bottom, or for some other reason, they could be seen floating downwards like leaves. Thicker and thicker they floated, till their blackness almost blotted out the fiery river and the groves of live gems.

“Goodbye to your Honours. I'm off,” shouted Golg, and dived. Only a few were left to follow him. The chasm was now no broader than a stream. Now it was narrow as the slit in a pillarbox. Now it was only an intensely bright thread. Then, with a shock like a thousand goods trains crashing into a thousand pairs of buffers, the lips of rock closed. The hot, maddening smell vanished. The travellers were alone in an Underworld which now looked far blacker than before. Pale, dim, and dreary, the lamps marked the direction of the road.

“Now,” said Puddleglum, “it's ten to one we've already stayed too long, but we may as well make a try. Those lamps will give out in five minutes, I shouldn't wonder.”

They urged the horses to a canter and thundered along the dusky road in fine style. But almost at once it began going downhill. They would have thought Golg had sent them the wrong way if they had not seen, on the other side of the valley, the lamps going on and upwards as far as the eye could reach. But at the bottom of the valley the lamps shone on moving water.

“Haste,” cried the Prince. They galloped down the slope. It would have been nasty enough at the bottom even five minutes later for the tide was running up the valley like a mill-race, and if it had come to swimming, the horses could hardly have won over. But it was still only a foot or two deep, and though it swished terribly round the horses' legs, they reached the far side in safety.

Then began the slow, weary march uphill with nothing ahead to look at but the pale lamps which went up and up as far as the eye could reach. When they looked back they could see the water spreading. All the hills of Underland were now islands, and it was only on those islands that the lamps remained. Every moment some distant light vanished. Soon there would be total darkness everywhere except on the road they were following; and even on the lower part of it behind them, though no lamps had yet gone out, the lamplight shone on water.

Although they had good reason for hurrying, the horses could not go on for ever without a rest. They halted: and in silence they could hear the lapping of water.

“I wonder is what's his name—Father Time—flooded out now,” said Jill. “And all those queer sleeping animals.”

“I don't think we're as high as that,” said Eustace. “Don't you remember how we had to go downhill to reach the sunless sea? I shouldn't think the water has reached Father Time's cave yet.”

“That's as may be,” said Puddleglum. “I'm more interested in the lamps on this road. Look a bit sickly, don't they?”

“They always did,” said Jill.

“Aye,” said Puddleglum. “But they're greener now.”

“You don't mean to say you think they're going out?” cried Eustace.

“Well, however they work, you can't expect them to last for ever, you know,” replied the Marsh-wiggle. “But don't let your spirits down, Scrubb. I've got my eye on the water too, and I don't think it's rising so fast as it did.”

“Small comfort, friend,” said the Prince. “If we cannot find our way out. I cry you mercy, all. I am to blame for my pride and fantasy which delayed us by the mouth of the land of Bism. Now, let us ride on.”

During the hour or so that followed Jill sometimes thought that Puddleglum was right about the lamps, and sometimes thought it was only her imagination. Meanwhile the land was changing. The roof of Underland was so near that even by that dull light they could now see it quite distinctly. And the great, rugged walls of Underland could be seen drawing closer on each side. The road, in fact, was leading them up into a steep tunnel. They began to pass picks and shovels and barrows and other signs that the diggers had recently been at work. If only one could be sure of getting out, all this was very cheering. But the thought of going on into a hole that would get narrower and narrower, and harder to turn back in, was very unpleasant.

At last the roof was so low that Puddleglum and the Prince knocked their heads against it. The party dismounted and led the horses. The road was uneven here and one had to pick one's steps with some care. That was how Jill noticed the growing darkness. There was no doubt about it now. The faces of the others looked strange and ghastly in the green glow. Then all at once (she couldn't help it) Jill gave a little scream. One light, the next one ahead, went out altogether. The one behind them did the same. Then they were in absolute darkness.

“Courage, friends,” came Prince Rilian's voice. “Whether we live or die Aslan will be our good lord.”

“That's right, Sir,” said Puddleglum's voice. “And you must always remember there's one good thing about being trapped down here: it'll save funeral expenses.”

Jill held her tongue. (If you don't want other people to know how frightened you are, this is always a wise thing to do; it's your voice that gives you away.)

“We might as well go on as stand here,” said Eustace; and when she heard the tremble in his voice, Jill knew how wise she'd been not to trust her own.

Puddleglum and Eustace went first with their arms stretched out in front of them, for fear of blundering into anything; Jill and the Prince followed, leading the horses.

“I say,” came Eustace's voice much later, “are my eyes going queer or is there a patch of light up there?”

Before anyone could answer him, Puddleglum called out: “Stop. I'm up against a dead end. And it's earth, not rock. What were you saying, Scrubb?”

“By the Lion,” said the Prince, “Eustace is right. There is a sort of—”

“But it's not daylight,” said Jill. “It's only a cold blue sort of light.”

“Better than nothing, though,” said Eustace. “Can we get up to it?”

“It's not right overhead,” said Puddleglum. “It's above us, but it's in this wall that I've run into. How would it be, Pole, if you got on my shoulders and saw whether you could get up to it?”





CHAPTER FIFTEEN: THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JILL


THE patch of light did not show up anything down in the darkness where they were standing. The others could only hear, not see, Jill's efforts to get on to the Marsh-wiggle's back. That is, they heard him saying, “You needn't put your finger in my eye,” and, “Nor your foot in my mouth either,” and, “That's more like it,” and, “Now, I'll hold on to your legs. That'll leave your arms free to steady yourself against the earth.”

Then they looked up and soon they saw the black shape of Jill's head against the patch of light.

“Well?” they all shouted up anxiously.

“It's a hole,” called Jill's voice. “I could get through it if I was a little bit higher.”

“What do you see through it?” asked Eustace.

“Nothing much yet,” said Jill. “I say, Puddleglum, let go my legs so that I can stand on your shoulders instead of sitting on them. I can steady myself all right against the edge.”

They could hear her moving and then much more of her came into sight against the greyness of the opening; in fact all of her down to the waist.

“I say—” began Jill, but suddenly broke off with a cry: not a sharp cry. It sounded more as if her mouth had been muffled up or had something pushed into it. After that she found her voice and seemed to be shouting out as loud as she could, but they couldn't hear the words. Two things then happened at the same moment. The patch of light was completely blocked up for a second or so; and they heard both a scuffling, struggling sound and the voice of the Marsh-wiggle gasping: “Quick! Help! Hold on to her legs. Someone's pulling her. There! No, here. Too late!”

The opening, and the cold light which filled it, were now perfectly clear again. Jill had vanished.

“Jill! Jill!” they shouted frantically, but there was no answer.

“Why the dickens couldn't you have held her feet?” said Eustace.

“I don't know, Scrubb,” groaned Puddleglum. “Born to be a misfit, I shouldn't wonder. Fated. Fated to be Pole's death, just as I was fated to eat Talking Stag at Harfang. Not that it isn't my own fault as well, of course.”

“This is the greatest shame and sorrow that could have fallen on us,” said the Prince. “We have sent a brave lady into the hands of enemies and stayed behind in safety.”

“Don't paint it too black, Sir,” said Puddleglum. “We're not very safe except for death by starvation in this hole.”

“I wonder am I small enough to get through where Jill did?” said Eustace.

What had really happened to Jill was this. As soon as she got her head out of the hole she found that she was looking down as if from an upstairs window, not up as if through a trap-door. She had been so long in the dark that her eyes couldn't at first take in what they were seeing: except that she was not looking at the daylit, sunny world which she so wanted to see. The air seemed to be deadly cold, and the light was pale and blue. There was also a good deal of noise going on and a lot of white objects flying about in the air. It was at that moment that she had shouted down to Puddleglum to let her stand up on his shoulders.

When she had done this, she could see and hear a good deal better. The noises she had been hearing turned out to be of two kinds: the rhythmical thump of several feet, and the music of four fiddles, three flutes, and a drum. She also got her own position clear. She was looking out of a hole in a steep bank which sloped down and reached the level about fourteen feet below her. Everything was very white. A lot of people were moving about. Then she gasped! The people were trim little Fauns, and Dryads with leafcrowned hair floating behind them. For a second they looked as if they were moving anyhow; then she saw that they were really doing a dance—a dance with so many complicated steps and figures that it took you some time to understand it. Then it came over her like a thunderclap that the pale, blue light was really moonlight, and the white stuff on the ground was really snow. And of course! There were the stars staring in a black frosty sky overhead. And the tall black things behind the dancers were trees. They had not only got out into the upper world at last, but had come out in the heart of Narnia. Jill felt she could have fainted with delight; and the music—the wild music, intensely sweet and yet just the least bit eerie too, and full of good magic—as the Witch's thrumming had been full of bad magic-made her feel it all the more.

All this takes a long time to tell, but of course it took a very short time to see. Jill turned almost at once to shout down to the others, “I say! It's all right. We're out, and we're home.” But the reason she never got further than “I say” was this. Circling round and round the dancers was a ring of Dwarfs, all dressed in their finest clothes; mostly scarlet with furlined hoods and golden tassels and big furry top-boots. As they circled round they were all diligently throwing snowballs. (Those were the white things that Jill had seen flying through the air.) They weren't throwing them at the dancers as silly boys might have been doing in England. They were throwing them through the dance in such perfect time with the music and with such perfect aim that if all the dancers were in exactly the right places at exactly the right moments, no one would be hit. This is called the Great Snow Dance and it is done every year in Narnia on the first moonlit night when there is snow on the ground. Of course it is a kind of game as well as a dance, because every now and then some dancer will be the least little bit wrong and get a snowball in the face, and then everyone laughs. But a good team of dancers, Dwarfs, and musicians will keep it up for hours without a single hit. On fine nights when the cold and the drumtaps, and the hooting of the owls, and the moonlight, have got into their wild, woodland blood and made it even wilder, they will dance till daybreak. I wish you could see it for yourselves.

What had stopped Jill when she got as far as the say of “I say” was of course simply a fine big snowball that came sailing through the dance from a Dwarf on the far side and got her fair and square in the mouth. She didn't in the least mind; twenty snowballs would not have damped her spirits at that moment. But however happy you are feeling, you can't talk with your mouth full of snow. And when, after considerable spluttering, she could speak again, she quite forgot in her excitement that the others, down in the dark, behind her, still didn't know the good news. She simply leaned as far out of the hole as she could, and yelled to the dancers.

“Help! Help! We're buried in the hill. Come and dig us out.”

The Narnians, who had not even noticed the little hole in the hillside, were of course very surprised, and looked about in several wrong directions before they found out where the voice was coming from. But when they caught sight of Jill they all came running towards her, and as many as could scrambled up the bank, and a dozen or more hands were stretched up to help her. And Jill caught hold of them and thus got out of the hole and came slithering down the bank head first, and then picked herself up and said:

“Oh, do go and dig the others out. There are three others, besides the horses. And one of them is Prince Rilian.”

She was already in the middle of a crowd when she said this, for besides the dancers all sorts of people who had been watching the dance, and whom she had not seen at first, came running up. Squirrels came out of the trees in showers, and so did Owls. Hedgehogs came waddling as fast as their short legs would carry them. Bears and Badgers followed at a slower pace. A great Panther, twitching its tail in excitement, was the last to join the party.

But as soon as they understood what Jill was saying, they all became active. “Pick and shovel, boys, pick and shovel. Off for our tools!” said the Dwarfs, and dashed away into the woods at top speed. “Wake up some Moles, they're the chaps for digging. They're quite as good as Dwarfs,” said a voice. “What was that she said about Prince Rilian?” said another. “Hush!” said the Panther. “The poor child's crazed, and no wonder after being lost inside the hill. She doesn't know what she's saying.” “That's right,” said an old Bear. “Why, she said Prince Rilian was a horse!” “No, she didn't,” said a Squirrel, very pert.—“Yes, she did,” said another Squirrel, even perter.

“It's quite t-t-t-true. D-d-don't be so silly,” said Jill. She spoke like that because her teeth were now chattering with the cold.

Immediately one of the Dryads flung round her a furry cloak which some Dwarf had dropped when he rushed to fetch his mining tools, and an obliging Faun trotted off among the trees to a place where Jill could see firelight in the mouth of a cave, to get her a hot drink. But before it came, all the Dwarfs reappeared with spades and pick-axes and charged at the hillside. Then Jill heard cries of “Hi! What are you doing? Put that sword down,” and “Now, young 'un: none of that,” and, “He's a vicious one, now, isn't he?” Jill hurried to the spot and didn't know whether to laugh or cry when she saw Eustace's face, very pale and dirty, projecting from the blackness of the hole, and Eustace's right hand brandishing a sword with which he made lunges at anyone who came near him.

For of course Eustace had been having a very different time from Jill during the last few minutes. He had heard Jill cry out and seen her disappear into the unknown. Like the Prince and Puddleglum, he thought that some enemies had caught her. And from down below he didn't see that the pale, blueish light was moonlight. He thought the hole would lead only into some other cave, lit by some ghostly phosphorescence and filled with goodness-knows-what evil creatures of the Underworld. So that when he had persuaded Puddleglum to give him a back, and drawn his sword, and poked out his head, he had really been doing a very brave thing. The others would have done it first if they could, but the hole was too small for them to climb through. Eustace was a little bigger, and a lot clumsier, than Jill, so that when he looked out he bumped his head against the top of the hole and brought a small avalanche of snow down on his face. And so, when he could see again, and saw dozens of figures coming at him as hard as they could run, it is not surprising that he tried to ward them off.

“Stop, Eustace, stop,” cried Jill. “They're all friends. Can't you see? We've come up in Narnia. Everything's all right.”

Then Eustace did see, and apologized to the Dwarfs (and the Dwarfs said not to mention it), and dozens of thick, hairy, dwarfish hands helped him out just as they had helped Jill out a few minutes before. Then Jill scrambled up the bank and put her head in at the dark opening and shouted the good news in to the prisoners. As she turned away she heard Puddleglum mutter. “Ah, poor Pole. It's been too much for her, this last bit. Turned her head, I shouldn't wonder. She's beginning to see things.”

Jill rejoined Eustace and they shook one another by both hands and took in great deep breaths of the free midnight air. And a warm cloak was brought for Eustace and hot drinks, for both. While they were sipping it, the Dwarfs had already got all the snow and all the sods off a large strip of the hillside round the original hole, and the pickaxes and spades were now going as merrily as the feet of Fauns and Dryads had been going in the dance ten minutes before. Only ten minutes! Yet already it felt to Jill and Eustace as if all their dangers in the dark and heat and general smotheriness of the earth must have been only a dream. Out here, in the cold, with the moon and the huge stars overhead (Narnian stars are nearer than stars in our world) and with kind, merry faces all round them, one couldn't quite believe in Underland.

Before they had finished their hot drinks, a dozen or so Moles, newly waked and still very sleepy, and not well pleased, had arrived. But as soon as they understood what it was all about, they joined in with a will. Even the Fauns made themselves useful by carting away the earth in little barrows, and the Squirrels danced and leaped to and fro in great excitement, though Jill never found out exactly what they thought they were doing. The Bears and Owls contented themselves with giving advice, and kept on asking the children if they wouldn't like to come into the cave (that was where Jill had seen the firelight) and get warm and have supper. But the children couldn't bear to go without seeing their friends set free.

No one in our world can work at a job of that sort as Dwarfs and Talking Moles work in Narnia; but then, of course, Moles and Dwarfs don't look on it as work. They like digging. It was therefore not really long before they had opened a great black chasm in the hillside. And out from the blackness into the moonlight—this would have been rather dreadful if one hadn't known who they were—came, first, the long, leggy, steeple-hatted figure of the Marsh-wiggle, and then, leading two great horses, Rilian the Prince himself.

As Puddleglum appeared shouts broke out on every side: “Why, it's a Wiggle—why, it's old Puddleglum—old Puddleglum from the Eastern Marshes—what ever have you been doing, Puddleglum?—there've been search parties out for you—the Lord Trumpkin has been putting up notices—there's a reward offered!” But all this died away, all in one moment, into dead silence, as quickly as the noise dies away in a rowdy dormitory if the Headmaster opens the door. For now they saw the Prince.

No one doubted for a moment who he was. There were plenty of Beasts and Dryads and Dwarfs and Fauns who remembered him from the days before his enchanting. There were some old ones who could just remember how his father, King Caspian, had looked when he was a young man, and saw the likeness. But I think they would have known him anyway. Pale though he was from long imprisonment in the Deep Lands, dressed in black, dusty, dishevelled, and weary, there was something in his face and air which no one could mistake. That look is in the face of all true kings of Narnia, who rule by the will of Aslan and sit at Cair Paravel on the throne of Peter the High King.

Instantly every head was bared and every knee was bent; a moment later such cheering and shouting, such jumps and reels of joy, such hand-shakings and kissings and embracings of everybody by everybody else broke out that the tears came into Jill's eyes. Their quest had been worth all the pains it cost.

“Please it your Highness,” said the oldest of the Dwarfs, “there is some attempt at a supper in the cave yonder, prepared against the ending of the snow-dance—”

“With a good will, Father,” said the Prince. “For never had any Prince, Knight, Gentleman, or Bear so good a stomach to his victuals as we four wanderers have tonight.”

The whole crowd began to move away through the trees towards the cave. Jill heard Puddleglum saying to those who pressed round him. “No, no, my story can wait.

Nothing worth talking about has happened to me. I want to hear the news. Don't try breaking it to me gently, for I'd rather have it all at once. Has the King been shipwrecked? Any forest fires? No wars on the Calormen border? Or a few dragons, I shouldn't wonder?” And all the creatures laughed aloud and said, “Isn't that just like a Marsh-wiggle?”

The two children were nearly dropping with tiredness and hunger, but the warmth of the cave, and the very sight of it, with the firelight dancing on the walls and dressers and cups and saucers and plates and on the smooth stone floor, just as it does in a farmhouse kitchen, revived them a little. All the same they went fast asleep while supper was being got ready. And while they slept Prince Rilian was talking over the whole adventure with the older and wiser Beasts and Dwarfs. And now they all saw what it meant; how a wicked Witch (doubtless the same kind as that White Witch who had brought the Great Winter on Narnia long ago) had contrived the whole thing, first killing Rilian's mother and enchanting Rilian himself. And they saw how she had dug right under Narnia and was going to break out and rule it through Rilian: and how he had never dreamed that the country of which she would make him king (king in name, but really her slave) was his own country. And from the children's part of the story they saw how she was in league and friendship with the dangerous giants of Harfang.

“And the lesson of it all is, your Highness,” said the oldest Dwarf, “that those Northern Witches always mean the same thing, but in every age they have a different plan for getting it.”





CHAPTER SIXTEEN: THE HEALING OF HARMS


WHEN Jill woke next morning and found herself in a cave, she thought for one horrid moment that she was back in the Underworld. But when she noticed that she was lying on a bed of heather with a furry mantle over her, and saw a cheery fire crackling (as if newly lit) on a stone hearth and, further off, morning sunlight coming in through the cave's mouth, she remembered all the happy truth. They had had a delightful supper, all crowded into that cave, in spite of being so sleepy before it was properly over. She had a vague impression of Dwarfs crowding round the fire with frying-pans rather bigger than themselves, and the hissing, and delicious smell of sausages, and more, and more, and more sausages. And not wretched sausages half full of bread and soya bean either, but real meaty, spicy ones, fat and piping hot and burst and just the tiniest bit burnt. And great mugs of frothy chocolate, and roast potatoes and roast chestnuts, and baked apples with raisins stuck in where the cores had been, and then ices just to freshen you up after all the hot things.

Jill sat up and looked around. Puddleglum and Eustace were lying not far away, both fast asleep.

“Hi, you two!” shouted Jill in a loud voice. “Aren't you ever going to get up?”

“Shoo, shoo!” said a sleepy voice somewhere above her. “Time to be settling down. Have a good snooze, do, do. Don't make a to-do. Tu-whoo!”

“Why, I do believe,” said Jill, glancing up at a white bundle of fluffy feathers which was perched on top of a grandfather clock in one corner of the cave, “I do believe it's Glimfeather!”

“True, true,” whirred the Owl, lifting its head out from under its wing and opening one eye. “I came up with a message for the Prince at about two. The squirrels brought us the good news. Message for the Prince. He's gone. You're to follow too. Good-day—” and the head disappeared again.

As there seemed no further hope of getting any information from the Owl, Jill got up and began looking round for any chance of a wash and some breakfast. But almost at once a little Faun came trotting into the cave with a sharp click-clack of his goaty hoofs on the stone floor.

“Ah! You've woken up at last, Daughter of Eve,” he said. “Perhaps you'd better wake the Son of Adam. You've got to be off in a few minutes and two Centaurs have very kindly offered to let you ride on their backs down to Cair Paravel.” He added in a lower voice. “Of course, you realize it is a most special and unheard-of honour to be allowed to ride a Centaur. I don't know that I ever heard of anyone doing it before. It wouldn't do to keep them waiting.”

“Where's the Prince?” was the first question of Eustace and Puddleglum as soon as they had been wakened.

“He's gone down to meet the King, his father, at Cair Paravel,” answered the Faun, whose name was Orruns. “His Majesty's ship is expected in harbour any moment. It seems that the King met Aslan—I don't know whether it was in a vision or face to face—before he had sailed far, and Aslan turned him back and told him he would find his long-lost son awaiting him when he reached Narnia.”

Eustace was now up and he and Jill set about helping Orruns to get the breakfast. Puddleglum was told to stay in bed. A Centaur called Cloudbirth, a famous healer, or (as Orruns called it) a “leech”, was coming to see to his burnt foot.

“Ah!” said Puddleglum in a tone almost of contentment, “he'll want to have the leg off at the knee, I shouldn't wonder. You see if he doesn't.” But he was quite glad to stay in bed.

Breakfast was scrambled eggs and toast and Eustace tackled it just as if he had not had a very large supper in the middle of the night.

“I say, Son of Adam,” said the Faun, looking with a certain awe at Eustace's mouthfuls. “There's no need to hurry quite so dreadfully as that. I don't think the Centaurs have quite finished their breakfasts yet.”

“Then they must have got up very late,” said Eustace. “I bet it's after ten o'clock.”

“Oh no,” said Orruns. “They got up before it was light.”

“Then they must have waited the dickens of a time for breakfast,” said Eustace.

“No, they didn't,” said Orruns. “They began eating the minute they awoke.”

“Golly!” said Eustace. “Do they eat a very big breakfast?”

“Why, Son of Adam, don't you understand? A Centaur has a man-stomach and a horsestomach. And of course both want breakfast. So first of all he has porridge and pavenders and kidneys and bacon and omelette and cold ham and toast and marmalade and coffee and beer. And after that he attends to the horse part of himself by grazing for an hour or so and finishing up with a hot mash, some oats, and a bag of sugar. That's why it's such a serious thing to ask a Centaur to stay for the weekend. A very serious thing indeed.”

At that moment there was a sound of horse-hoofs tapping on rock from the mouth of the cave, and the children looked up. The two Centaurs, one with a black and one with a golden beard flowing over their magnificent bare chests, stood waiting for them, bending their heads a little so as to look into the cave. Then the children became very polite and finished their breakfast very quickly. No one thinks a Centaur funny when he sees it. They are solemn, majestic people, full of ancient wisdom which they learn from the stars, not easily made either merry or angry; but their anger is terrible as a tidal wave when it comes.

“Goodbye, dear Puddleglum,” said Jill, going over to the Marsh-wiggle's bed. “I'm sorry we called you a wet blanket.”

“So'm I,” said Eustace. “You've been the best friend in the world.”

“And I do hope we'll meet again,” added Jill.

“Not much chance of that, I should say,” replied Puddleglum. “1 don't reckon I'm very likely to see my old wigwam again either. And that Prince—he's a nice chap—but do you think he's very strong? Constitution ruined with living underground, I shouldn't wonder. Looks the sort that might go off any day.”

“Puddleglum!” said Jill. “You're a regular old humbug. You sound as doleful as a funeral and I believe you're perfectly happy. And you talk as if you were afraid of everything, when you're really as brave as—as a lion.”

“Now, speaking of funerals,” began Puddleglum, but Jill, who heard the Centaurs tapping with their hoofs behind her, surprised him very much by flinging her arms round his thin neck and kissing his muddy-looking face, while Eustace wrung his hand. Then they both rushed away to the Centaurs, and the Marsh-wiggle, sinking back on his bed, remarked to himself, “Well, I wouldn't have dreamt of her doing that. Even though I am a goodlooking chap.”

To ride on a Centaur is, no doubt, a great honour (and except Jill and Eustace there is probably no one alive in the world today who has had it) but it is very uncomfortable. For no one who valued his life would suggest putting a saddle on a Centaur, and riding bareback is no fun; especially if, like Eustace, you have never learned to ride at all. The Centaurs were very polite in a grave, gracious, grown-up kind of way, and as they cantered through the Narnian woods they spoke, without turning their heads, telling the children about the properties of herbs and roots, the influences of the planets, the nine names of Aslan with their meanings, and things of that sort. But however sore and jolted the two humans were, they would now give anything to have that journey over again: to see those glades and slopes sparkling with last night's snow, to be met by rabbits and squirrels and birds that wished you good morning, to breathe again the air of Narnia and hear the voices of the Narnian trees.

They came down to the river, flowing bright and blue in winter sunshine, far below the last bridge (which is at the snug, red-roofed little town of Beruna) and were ferried across in a flat barge by the ferryman; or rather, by the ferry-wiggle, for it is Marsh-wiggles who do most of the watery and fishy kinds of work in Narnia. And when they had crossed they rode along the south bank of the river and presently came to Cair Paravel itself. And at the very moment of their arrival they saw that same bright ship which they had seen when they first set foot in Narnia, gliding up the river like a huge bird. All the court were once more assembled on the green between the castle and the quay to welcome King Caspian home again. Rilian, who had changed his black clothes and was now dressed in a scarlet cloak over silver mail, stood close to the water's edge, bare-headed, to receive his father; and the Dwarf Trumpkin sat beside him in his little donkey-chair. The children saw there would be no chance of reaching the Prince through all that crowd, and, anyway, they now felt rather shy. So they asked the Centaurs if they might go on sitting on their backs a little longer and thus see everything over the heads of the courtiers. And the Centaurs said they might.

A flourish of silver trumpets came over the water from the ship's deck: the sailors threw a rope; rats (Talking Rats, of course) and Marsh-wiggles made it fast ashore; and the ship was warped in. Musicians, hidden somewhere in the crowd, began to play solemn, triumphal music. And soon the King's galleon was alongside and the Rats ran the gangway on board her.

Jill expected to see the old King come down it. But there appeared to be some hitch. A Lord with a pale face came ashore and knelt to the Prince and to Trumpkin. The three were talking with their heads close together for a few minutes, but no one could hear what they said. The music played on, but you could feel that everyone was becoming uneasy. Then four Knights, carrying something and going very slowly, appeared on deck. When they started to come down the gangway you could see what they were carrying: it was the old King on a bed, very pale and still. They set him down. The Prince knelt beside him and embraced him. They could see King Caspian raising his hand to bless his son. And everyone cheered, but it was a half-hearted cheer, for they all felt that something was going wrong. Then suddenly the King's head fell back upon his pillows, the musicians stopped and there was a dead silence. The Prince, kneeling by the King's bed, laid down his head upon it and wept.

There were whisperings and goings to and fro. Then Jill noticed that all who wore hats, bonnets, helmets, or hoods were taking them off-Eustace included. Then she heard a rustling and flapping noise up above the castle; when she looked she saw that the great banner with the golden Lion on it was being brought down to half-mast. And after that, slowly, mercilessly, with wailing strings and disconsolate blowing of horns, the music began again: this time, a tune to break your heart.

They both slipped off their Centaurs (who took no notice of them).

“I wish I was at home,” said Jill.

Eustace nodded, saying nothing, and bit his lip.

“I have come,” said a deep voice behind them. They turned and saw the Lion himself, so bright and real and strong that everything else began at once to look pale and shadowy compared with him. And in less time than it takes to breathe Jill forgot about the dead King of Narnia and remembered only how she had made Eustace fall over the cliff, and how she had helped to muff nearly all the signs, and about all the snappings and quarrellings. And she wanted to say “I'm sorry” but she could not speak. Then the Lion drew them towards him with his eyes, and bent down and touched their pale faces with his tongue, and said:

“Think of that no more. I will not always be scolding. You have done the work for which I sent you into Narnia.”

“Please, Aslan,” said Jill, “may we go home now?”

“Yes. I have come to bring you Home,” said Aslan. Then he opened his mouth wide and blew. But this time they had no sense of flying through the air: instead, it seemed that they remained still, and the wild breath of Aslan blew away the ship and the dead King and the castle and the snow and the winter sky. For all these things floated off into the air like wreaths of smoke, and suddenly they were standing in a great brightness of midsummer sunshine, on smooth turf, among mighty trees, and beside a fair, fresh stream.

Then they saw that they were once more on the Mountain of Aslan, high up above and beyond the end of that world in which Narnia lies. But the strange thing was that the funeral music for King Caspian still went on, though no one could tell where it came from. They were walking beside the stream and the Lion went before them: and he became so beautiful, and the music so despairing, that Jill did not know which of them it was that filled her eyes with tears.

Then Aslan stopped, and the children looked into the stream. And there, on the golden gravel of the bed of the stream, lay King Caspian, dead, with the water flowing over him like liquid glass. His long white beard swayed in it like water-weed. And all three stood and wept. Even the Lion wept: great Lion-tears, each tear more precious than the Earth would be if it was a single solid diamond. And Jill noticed that Eustace looked neither like a child crying, nor like a boy crying and wanting to hide it, but like a grownup crying. At least, that is the nearest she could get to it; but really, as she said, people don't seem to have any particular ages on that mountain.

“Son of Adam,” said Aslan, “go into that thicket and pluck the thorn that you will find there, and bring it to me.”

Eustace obeyed. The thorn was a foot long and sharp as a rapier.

“Drive it into my paw, Son of Adam,” said Aslan, holding up his right fore-paw and spreading out the great pad towards Eustace.

“Must I?” said Eustace.

“Yes,” said Aslan.

Then Eustace set his teeth and drove the thorn into the Lion's pad. And there came out a great drop of blood, redder than all redness that you have ever seen or imagined.

And it splashed into the stream over the dead body of the King. At the same moment the doleful music stopped. And the dead King began to be changed. His white beard turned to grey, and from grey to yellow, and got shorter and vanished altogether; and his sunken cheeks grew round and fresh, and the wrinkles were smoothed, and his eyes opened, and his eyes and lips both laughed, and suddenly he leaped up and stood before them—a very young man, or a boy. (But Jill couldn't say which, because of people having no particular ages in Aslan's country. Even in this world, of course, it is the stupidest children who are most childish and the stupidest grown-ups who are most grown-up.) And he rushed to Aslan and flung his arms as far as they would go round the huge neck; and he gave Aslan the strong kisses of a King, and Aslan gave him the wild kisses of a Lion.

At last Caspian turned to the others. He gave a great laugh of astonished joy.

“Why! Eustace!” he said. “Eustace! So you did reach the end of the world after all. What about my second-best sword that you broke on the sea-serpent?”

Eustace made a step towards him with both hands held out, but then drew back with a somewhat startled expression.

“Look here! I say,” he stammered. “It's all very well. But aren't you—? I mean didn't you—?”

“Oh, don't be such an ass,” said Caspian.

“But,” said Eustace, looking at Aslan. “Hasn't he—er—died?”

“Yes,” said the Lion in a very quiet voice, almost (Jill thought) as if he were laughing. “He has died. Most people have, you know. Even I have. There are very few who haven't.”

“Oh,” said Caspian. “I see what's bothering you. You think I'm a ghost, or some nonsense. But don't you see? I would be that if I appeared in Narnia now: because I don't belong there any more. But one can't be a ghost in one's own country. I might be a ghost if I got into your world. I don't know. But I suppose it isn't yours either, now you're here.”

A great hope rose in the children's hearts. But Aslan shook his shaggy head. “No, my dears,” he said. “When you meet me here again, you will have come to stay. But not now. You must go back to your own world for a while.”

“Sir,” said Caspian, “I've always wanted to have just one glimpse of their world. Is that wrong?”

“You cannot want wrong things any more, now that you have died, my son,” said Aslan. “And you shall see their world—for five minutes of their time. It will take no longer for you to set things right there.” Then Aslan explained to Caspian what Jill and Eustace were going back to and all about Experiment House: he seemed to know it quite as well as they did.

“Daughter,” said Aslan to Jill, “pluck a switch off that bush.” She did; and as soon as it was in her hand it turned into a fine new riding crop.

“Now, Sons of Adam, draw your swords,” said Aslan. “But use only the flat, for it is cowards and children, not warriors, against whom 1 send you.”

“Are you coming with us, Aslan?” said Jill.

“They shall see only my back,” said Aslan.

He led them rapidly through the wood, and before they had gone many paces, the wall of Experiment House appcared before them. Then Aslan roared so that the sun shook in the sky and thirty feet of the wall fell down before them. They looked through the gap, down into the school shrubbery and on to the roof of the gym, all under the same dull autumn sky which they had seen before their adventures began. Aslan turned to Jill and Eustace and breathed upon them and touched their foreheads with his tongue. Then he lay down amid the gap he had made in the wall and turned his golden back to England, and his lordly face towards his own lands. At the same moment Jill saw figures whom she knew only too well running up through the laurels towards them.

Most of the gang were there—Adela Pennyfather and Cholmondely Major, Edith Winterblott, ‘Spotty’ Sorrier, big Bannister, and the two loathsome Garrett twins. But suddenly they stopped. Their faces changed, and all the meanness, conceit, cruelty, and sneakishness almost disappeared in one single expression of terror. For they saw the wall fallen down, and a lion as large as a young elephant lying in the gap, and three figures in glittering clothes with weapons in their hands rushing down upon them. For, with the strength of Aslan in them, Jill plied her crop on the girls and Caspian and Eustace plied the flats of their swords on the boys so well that in two minutes all the bullies were running like mad, crying out, “Murder! Fascists! Lions! It isn't fair.” And then the Head (who was, by the way, a woman) came running out to see what was happening. And when she saw the lion and the broken wall and Caspian and Jill and Eustace (whom she quite failed to recognize) she had hysterics and went back to the house and began ringing up the police with stories about a lion escaped from a circus, and escaped convicts who broke down walls and carried drawn swords. In the midst of all this fuss Jill and Eustace slipped quietly indoors and changed out of their bright clothes into ordinary things, and Caspian went back into his own world. And the wall, at Aslan's word, was made whole again. When the police arrived and found no lion, no broken wall, and no convicts, and the Head behaving like a lunatic, there was an inquiry into the whole thing. And in the inquiry all sorts of things about Experiment House came out, and about ten people got expelled. After that, the Head's friends saw that the Head was no use as a Head, so they got her made an Inspector to interfere with other Heads. And when they found she wasn't much good even at that, they got her into Parliament where she lived happily ever after.

Eustace buried his fine clothes secretly one night in the school grounds, but Jill smuggled hers home and wore them at a fancy-dress ball next holidays. And from that day forth things changed for the better at Experiment House, and it became quite a good school. And Jill and Eustace were always friends.

But far off in Narnia, King Rilian buried his father, Caspian the Navigator, Tenth of that name, and mourned for him. He himself ruled Narnia well and the land was happy in his days, though Puddleglum (whose foot was as good as new in three weeks) often pointed out that bright mornings brought on wet afternoons, and that you couldn't expect good times to last. The opening into the hillside was left open, and often in hot summer days the Narnians go in there with ships and lanterns and down to the water and sail to and fro, singing, on the cool, dark underground sea, telling each other stories of the cities that lie fathoms deep below. If ever you have the luck to go to Narnia yourself, do not forget to have a look at those caves.
