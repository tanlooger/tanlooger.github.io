墙上的斑点


我初次看到墙上的那个斑点差不多是在今年一月中旬，为了要具体到哪一天，我想我还得回忆当时都看见了些什么。首先浮现在我脑海中的是炉火，一整片黄色的火光映射在我的书页上，三朵菊花安静地伫立在壁炉上的圆形玻璃缸中。是的，我可以肯定，那定是冬季里的某天，我们刚饮过茶后，因为我记得当时我正在抽烟，偶然一抬头，第一次看见了墙上的这个斑点。循着烟雾望去，我的目光在那堆火红的炭块上片刻停留。久违的幻觉再次浮现，数不清的红衣骑士如潮水般策马奔上黑色岩壁的侧坡，鲜红的旗帜依稀在城堡的塔楼上随风飘扬。而就是那个斑点把我从幻觉中拉回现实，我的心情也变得轻松起来，因为那幻觉是陈旧的，是一种无意识的幻想，大概萌生于我的童年。那是一个呈暗黑色的圆形小斑点，就在壁炉上方六七寸的雪白墙壁上。

我们的思绪总会轻易地喷涌而出，围着一件新鲜事物打转，就仿佛一群蚂蚁，狂热地抬起一根稻草，片时之后又将其抛弃……如果这个斑点是一枚钉子所遗留下的痕迹，那铁定不是为了挂一幅油画，而是为了挂一幅小肖像画——一幅贵妇人的肖像画，画中的贵妇用白粉扑饰鬈发，用脂粉装扮脸庞，而她的嘴唇就如红石竹花般娇艳。当然，这肖像画无疑是件赝品，这房子以前的主人也只会选这一类画——老房子就应该配老式画像，他们就是这样一家人——十分有趣的一家。我常常会想到他们，基于一些奇怪的场景，毕竟谁都不会再见到他们，也不会知道他们后来的遭遇。他说那家人是因为想换一套其他样式的家具才搬出了这所房子，就在他正说着在他看来艺术品背后应该包含着思想的瞬间，我们分手了。这情形如同我们坐在火车上，看见有个老太太在路旁郊外的别墅里正准备倒茶，有个青年正举起球拍打网球。火车一霎而过，我们便和老太太及青年分了手，并将他们抛于火车之后。

不过，我仍无法弄清那个斑点的实质，毕竟我不相信它是由一枚钉子造成的，对于一枚钉子而言，它太大，也太圆了。我倒是可以站起来，但即便我站起来去瞧它，也八成说不出它是个什么。因为一旦完成一件事，就没人知道它为什么会发生。哦！老天！生命是多么的奇特，思想是多么的难以捉摸，人类是多么的无知！为了验证我们对自己的私有物品是多么地无从控制——相对我们的文明而言，人的生活有太多偶然性——我只需列举我们一生中遗失的少数几件物件就够了。譬如那三只装着订书工具的浅蓝色罐子，这算得上遗失物中最神秘的类型——它们总不会是被猫吃了，或是被老鼠啃了。再譬如那几个鸟笼、铁裙箍、钢质滑冰鞋、安女王时代的煤斗子、弹珠戏球台、手摇风琴——全不见了，那些珠宝也都不见了，还有那些散落在芜菁根部的乳白宝石和绿宝石。它们都是费尽心血省吃俭用积攒起来的。这一刻我的背上还盖着衣服，身边的家具都还颇有价值，这是多么神奇啊！若是要用什么来比喻生活，就只能是像一个人被以每小时五十英里的速度抛出地下铁道，当他从隧道口出来时，赤身裸体，连头发上的一只发卡都不剩，就这样又被抛到上帝脚下。如同一捆捆棕色纸包被扔进邮局的管道[1]一样，倒立着摔在开满水仙的草原上，头发随风飞扬，与奔跑在赛马会上的马的尾巴十分相像。对了，这些比拟同样适用于表达生活的快速性，表达永无止境的消耗和修复，一切都是如此偶然，如此碰巧……

那来世又怎样呢？粗壮的绿色枝条在拉扯中缓慢地弯了下来，杯盏形的花朵如同倾翻一般，用它那紫色和红色的光芒照耀着人们。人究竟为何要投生到此地，而非彼地，不能行动、不能说话、连目光也无法集中，只得在青草之间或巨人的脚间摸索呢？而对于何为树，男人和女人的本质是什么，或是否存在这些东西，五十年后人们也无法给出答案。除了充满黑和白的空间，没有其他的东西。若干条粗大的茎干横亘中间，或许在更高一点的地方，还有一些颜色模糊的玫瑰花形状的斑块——淡粉色或蓝色——它会随时光流逝而愈加清楚，愈加——我也不知道怎样……

不过，墙上的斑点不是个小洞，它大概是个深黑色的圆形物。比如说是一片在夏天保存下来的玫瑰花瓣的杰作，因为我并不是一个十分警惕的管家——看看壁炉上的尘土，那就是证据。传言特洛伊城就是被这样的尘土给结结实实地埋了三层，只有一些罐子的碎片无法被它们毁灭，这一点完全令人信服。

窗外树枝柔和地轻叩玻璃——我希望能够悠闲、安静地思考，不被人打扰，不必从椅子上站起来，可以在没有任何反对和阻碍的情况下，轻松地从这件事想到那件事。我希望远离表层的某些事实，能够不断深入地沉下去。使自己保持平稳，以使我能抓住第一个一闪而过的念头……莎士比亚……对啦，不管是他还是其他的什么人都行。此人在扶手椅里安稳地坐着，看着炉火，如此这般——一阵像暴雨般的想法从天国连续不断地倾注到他的脑中。人们站在敞开的大门外面向里张望，他正用手支着前额——我们假设这情景发生在夏天的傍晚——可是，这一切虚构的历史太过沉闷，我对它根本没有兴趣。我希望我能想出一条令人满意的思路，这条思路还能间接地给我带来几分荣耀，这种想法是最美妙的。连那些深以为自己不爱听到他人赞赏的谦虚之人也时常产生这种想法。这种想法不同于那些直截了当进行自我赞扬的想法，这就是妙处，这种想法是这样的：

我走进屋子的当儿，他们正在谈植物学，我说我曾经看见一朵花，就在金斯威一座老房子的地基上，大概是人们在查理一世当国王时种下的一粒花籽。“人们在查理一世当国王时种些什么花呢？”我问道——（我已经忘了回答的是什么）。可能是有着紫色花穗的高高的花吧，于是便这样想了下去。同时，我一直在自己的脑海里爱怜且低调地打扮自己的形象，完全不是那种公开的做派。因为，倘若我真的公开这么干了，我就会马上用书来掩盖自己。这也着实奇怪，人们通常都会本能地进行自卫，以免被偶像崇拜或别的什么愚弄，或者避免太远离本貌而使人们不再相信。但是，这事实也很平常，这问题挺重要。假设镜子被打碎，那个浪漫的形象和周围一片葱郁的森林就会消失。只有别的人看见了那个人的外表——这个世界会变得何等的单调、沉闷！一个完全不适宜生存的世界。当我们在公共汽车和地铁上相对而坐的时候，我们就是在照镜子。这反映出了我们的眼神为什么那么没有神采。这些想法的重要性会被未来的小说家逐渐认识，因为这是无数想法，而非一个。他们会追逐那些深奥又虚幻的东西，他们也会将故事中现实的东西减得越来越少，并认为这类知识是一种天赋，希腊人就这样认为的，可能莎士比亚也是这么想的。但是，这种概括没一点儿价值，一听到概括这词儿的音调就已经够了，它使人回想起社会评论、内阁大臣等一系列事物。人们在幼年时期就认为这些事物很正经，不得违犯，否则便会有被打入十八层地狱的危险。提到概括，不知为何会让人联想到伦敦的星期日及星期日午后的散步和午餐，也会使人想起已经过世的人的音容笑貌。好比大伙一起坐在一间屋子里直到某个固定时间的习惯，尽管所有人都讨厌这么干。所有事都有一定的规矩，在那个特殊的时期，对桌布来说，规矩就是一定要用印有黄色的小方格的花毯做成，如同照片中所见到的皇宫走廊上铺的毯子。而其他花样的桌布就难被称作真正的桌布。当我们觉察到这些诸如星期天的午餐、散步以及庄园府邸和桌布等真实的事物很多是假的——的确有虚幻的感觉——而怀疑它们的人所得到的惩戒仅仅是一种违法的自由感时，让人很是惊奇！令我奇怪的是，究竟是什么代替了那些真实而又正经的东西？如果你是个女人，那它大概就是个男人。我们的生活被男性的想法支配，是它制定了那些准则以及惠特克的尊卑序列表[2]。据我推断，它在大战后已经让许多男人和女人觉得非常虚幻，并且我们盼望它短时间内就会像幻象、红木碗橱、兰西尔的版画、上帝、魔鬼和炼狱之类的东西般被嘲笑，被视为垃圾，为我们留下一种让人留恋的违法的自由感——若自由真实存在的话……

墙上的那个斑点在某种光线下看上去竟像是墙上凸出来的，它并不是一个完全的圆形。我不敢确定，不过它仿佛投下了一点模糊的影子，这使我感到，如果我用手指沿着墙壁摸过去，在某一点上，我会摸到一个非常小的旧坟，这旧坟如同南方唐斯丘陵[3]上的旧坟一样平滑，据说，它们如果不是坟墓，就是营地。两者之间，我倒希望它更像坟墓。就同多数英国人一样，我更钟情忧伤，并且觉得在散步后很自然就会联想到地下埋有白骨……绝对有一部书描绘过它。肯定有某个古董收藏家曾挖掘出这些白骨，并赋予它们名字……我渴望了解古董收藏家会是怎样的人？大概准是些上校在退役后带着一帮年老的工人爬上这儿的顶端，对泥块和石头进行检查，与邻近的牧师彼此通信。牧师在早餐时看拆开的信，感到自己很够分量。为了将不同的箭镞进行比较，需要在各县城之间进行频繁的乡间旅行，这样的旅行对牧师及他们的老伴都是一种惬意的职责，他们的老伴正打算用樱桃做酱，或正打算把书房收拾一番。他们自然希望那个有关营地或坟址的重大问题长期搁置。而就上校来说，他对搜集到这一问题两方面的证据很乐观。的确，他最终更倾向于相信营地说。面对质疑，他写了一篇文章，打算在本地会社的一个季度性的例会上朗读，这时他刚巧因中风病倒，盘旋在他头脑中的最后一个清醒的念头无关他的妻儿，而是营地和箭镞，这个箭镞此刻置身于当地博物馆的一个展柜，和一只中国女杀人犯的脚、一捧伊丽莎白时代的铁钉、相当大一堆都铎王朝的土制烟斗、一个罗马时代的陶制品，以及曾被纳尔逊[4]用来喝酒的酒杯放在一处——我的确不清楚它究竟证明了什么。

不，不，什么都没证明，什么都没发现。假设我当下站起身来，将墙上的斑点弄清楚，它的确是——该怎么说呢？——一枚被钉进墙里两百多年的旧的大钉子的头部，延续至今，经过数代女用仔细地擦拭，钉头终于露在了油漆的外面，在燃烧着炉火、墙壁洁白的房间里，初次领略现代生活，这样做我会有什么收获呢？是知识？还是一些可以让我增进思索的参考？静坐或站立都不会影响我的思考。知识是什么？我们的学者除了那些蹲在洞穴里或森林里煮草药、盘问老鼠、研究占星术的巫神的后裔和隐士们，还会是什么？随着我们的迷信越来越少，以及我们对漂亮和健康的意识越来越注重，我们对他们的崇敬也会越来越少。没错，人们可以构思一个迷人的世界，这是一个祥和宽广的世界，有着红艳和湛蓝的花朵在旷野上绽放。这个世界没有专家、学者，或是有着警察特征的管家。在这里人们能像鱼儿用鱼鳍划开水面般凭自己的想法划分世界，在轻柔地掠过荷花的茎条后，于满是白色海鸟蛋的鸟巢上飞旋……在世界的中心立足，穿过浑厚的海水和水中转瞬即逝的光影向上看，这里万籁俱寂——如果没有《惠特克年鉴》和尊卑序列表的话！

为了弄清墙上的斑点，我必须得跳起来观察下，不管它是——一枚钉子、一片玫瑰花瓣，还是一条在木块上开裂的纹。

大自然又在施展永存的老套路，她想这只是费点力气的事儿，或许违背现实，但是谁会无端指责惠特克尊卑序列表呢？大法官在坎特伯雷大主教的排名之后，紧接着是约克大主教。每个人都要有一个排列的顺序，这便是惠特克的哲学观念。排列次序极其关键，惠特克当然明白。大自然给你一个提醒，别因此而不高兴，要想到好的一面。如果你想不到好的一面，非得让这一小时变得扫兴的话，那就思考下墙上的斑点吧。

对于大自然的把戏我再清楚不过——她以卑劣的手段鼓动我们停止让人振奋或痛苦的思想。我想，正是这样，我们才看不惯那些实干家——这种人在我们看来毫无思想。不过，我们也可以试图通过观察墙上的斑点来转移这种苦涩的思想。

确实是这样，我此刻越认真瞧它，越感觉像在落水后抓住一块木板。我感受到一种让人欣慰的存在感，将那两位主教和大法官赶往虚幻的空间。这里，不是一件模糊不清的东西，它非常真实。半夜，我们被噩梦吓醒之后，也都会这样想，赶紧打开电灯，平静地躺一段时间，夸赞抽屉、夸赞坚实的物体、夸赞现实、夸赞这个能够证明我们并不是单独存在的客观世界。这也是一直困扰我们的问题……木头是一件值得让我们思考的事物。他来自一棵树，树木会渐渐长大，我们对它的生长经历一无所知。它们在森林、草地或水边生长——这些东西很符合我们思考的习惯——它们随年月生长，无视我们。炎热的下午，母牛的尾巴在树下摇摆；树木为小河边的地方装点上一片翠绿，甚至会让我们想到一只母红松鸡在潜水之后会披着绿毛出现。我非常热衷去想如同鼓风飞扬的旗帜般逆流游着的鱼群；我还热衷去想那些在河边制造圆土堆的水甲虫。我比较钟意那棵树自身的模样：最初是它本身木质的又干又密的感觉，接着受到风雨洗礼，然后就感到树的汁液慢慢地、畅快地逐渐流出来。我还热衷去想这棵树如何在冬天孤傲地伫立在旷野上，树叶抱成团，将柔软的内在隐藏起来，不让月光冷硬的子弹看到，如同在整夜不休地滚来滚去的大地上立着的一根光秃秃的桅杆。鸟儿在六月的叫声一定很喧嚣，很奇怪；小昆虫费劲地爬过皱皱的树皮，或是在树叶搭成的躺椅上享受日光浴，眼睛像红色的宝石一般，直视前方，此时它们的脚肯定很冷……酷寒使树木的纤维开裂。最后的暴风雨将树摧折，枝叶落入泥土。即便如此，生命也未消失。这个世界还散布着这棵树上的千百万个坚强且清晰的生命，可能在卧室中、在轮船上或人行道上，也可能被制成房内的护壁板，喝完茶后，人们就在这屋里抽烟。太多恬淡而幸福的联想是由这棵树所勾起的。我非常乐意依次去对它们进行思考。——不过，中间有些麻烦……我想到哪儿啦？怎么会想到这儿呢？不管是树、河流、唐斯、《惠特克年鉴》还是那些在原野上盛开的水仙花，我都忘了。所有的事物都在旋转下沉中消失……事物显得无比混乱。有人弯腰和我说话——

“我准备出去买份报纸。”

“是吗？”

“但是买报纸没什么意义……都是些旧闻。这该死的战争，让它下地狱去吧！……不过，无论如何，我想我们不该让一只蜗牛待在墙上面。”

啊，那个墙上的斑点！原来是只蜗牛。

三个画面


第一个


人若想看不到种种如画般的景象，大概是不可能的。假如你的父亲是我们王国的一名王室贵胄，而我的父亲只是一个铁匠，那么在你的眼中，我就好比一幅图画，而在我的眼中，你也好比一幅图画。我们无法因为各自讲着自然的语言就能走出那个隐形的画框。你看到我正靠着铁匠铺的门，手里抓着一块马蹄铁，你坐车路过，不禁会想：“这是一幅多么生动而特别的画面啊！”而我看到正悠闲坐在车里仿佛要向你的子民们致以问候的你，我也会想：“好一幅展现古老英格兰贵族奢侈生活的画面！”毫无疑问，我们对彼此的判断都是有出入的，可是这种出入却无法避免。

此时此刻，在路的拐角，我看到了这样一幅画面。其实，可以用“水手归乡图”或其他类似的题目来命名它。一个英俊年轻的水手背着行囊，他的手臂被一个姑娘挽着，邻居们都聚集在他们周围，小屋的园子里开满鲜花。当你经过他们时，你将从这幅画面的底部读到这样一些信息：水手漂洋过海，不远万里去往中国，而今回返故乡，家中客厅已备好一桌美酒佳肴为他接风洗尘；他为年轻妻子准备的礼物，就藏在他的行囊里；用不了多久，他们就会拥有自己的第一个孩子。人们会有这样一种感觉——这幅图景中所有的一切都是那么的温馨，美好，和谐，完美，就好像一切都本应该如此一般。

眼前的幸福有益身心，使人满足；生活好像变得比从前更加甜美，更加令人向往。

我带着这些遐想从他们面前经过，竭尽全力让这个画面变得尽可能地充实一些，我观察着她裙子的颜色，他眼睛的颜色，看着那只浅棕色的猫咪在小屋门口偷偷转悠。

短时期内，这些画面将悬浮在我的眼前，平日里的那些物事，此刻忽然明亮起来，温暖起来，越发质朴、淳厚。也有一些事，却显得乖谬、愚蠢。还有些事则显得理当如此，更显深意。从那天开始，一直到后来的数天内，每当人们享受闲适的时候，那个画面就会再次出现在他们的脑海里，他们会怀着满腔的善意来妒忌这两个幸运的人——那个幸福的水手，以及他的妻子。人们会猜测，他们这时候在做什么？在谈论什么？有了第一个画面，在想象力的驱策下，还会衍生出更多的画面来。有的画面里，水手在砍柴挑水；有的画面里，他与妻子在谈论中国；有的画面里，妻子为了让所有的人都看到，而把他送的礼物摆放在壁炉架上；有的画面里，妻子在为自己的宝宝缝制衣服；还有的画面里，小屋的门窗敞开，能看见花园里轻快飞舞的小鸟儿，能看见忙忙碌碌的蜜蜂，还能看见罗杰斯——这是水手的名字——叼着烟斗，迈步走进花园——有了一次远航中国海域的经历后，现在他简直无法形容眼前的一切到底有多么令他心满意足。





第二个


刺耳的哭号声打破深夜村庄的宁静。一阵杂乱的拖拽声过后，一切陷入死寂。透过窗只能看见道路两旁的丁香树沉重的枝杈悬吊在空中。这是一个无月之夜，寂静，闷热。所有的一切都因为那阵哭号声而变得凶厉起来。是谁在哭泣？为什么她要哭泣？听得出，那个声音出自一个女人，可是因为某种极端情绪的压迫，它已经变得没有任何性别特征可言，而纯粹变成了人性的哀号：宣泄某种不可言说的恐惧，或者因遭遇某种不平之事而大声申诉。

死一般的寂静。连星星都只是发着光亮，不再闪烁。田野间的树木屏息凝神，一动不动。可是不祥仍在弥漫，如同所有的一切都已被判决，被定罪。人们觉得应该做些什么。上下蹿动的火光应该不安地四处游移，某些人应该冲到街道上。那些小房子的窗口应该亮起灯光。或许还会再次传来哭号声，不过那声音多少平和了一些，有了女性的特点，她已经得到了一些安慰，不再泣不成声。可是并没有灯光亮起，也没有脚步声，第二声哭号也没有再响起。第一声哭号已被完全吞没，只剩下一片死寂。

人们躺在黑暗中细细谛听，那不过是一个声音。没有任何事情能与它联系在一起，也没有哪一个画面可以诠释它，以便让人容易理解。当黑暗最终褪去后，人们所能看见的不过是一个模模糊糊、完全不可辨认其体态的人影，正举着它那巨大的手臂，伸向苍天，申斥某种难以抗拒的不公。





第三个


天气一直晴朗适宜。人们甚至会觉得地球停泊在了某个港口，而生活也不再顺着风势卖力前行，它驶入了一个宁静的港湾，像是一动不动地停滞在了宁静的水域里，落碇抛锚——除了夜里的那一阵哭号声。不管人们走到哪儿，总是回荡着那个声音，比方在山里长时间溜达的时候，总是感到有些东西在深处慌乱涌动，以至于连四下里安稳宁静的景致也都虚幻起来。山坡上，一群群绵羊彼此聚拢；山谷如若平缓的水波，上下起伏，又如细小的涟漪，亲吻着海岸。时不时的，人们就会看见一所孤零零的农舍，院子里，有小狗在嬉戏打滚，有蝴蝶在荆豆花的上方翩翩起舞，所有的一切都显得宁静祥和——这一切总会被哭号声给摧毁的，人们不由自主地想到。所有的这一切，这些美好的景致，都参与并谋划了夜里的那场罪行。它们都承诺过，说要保持自己的美丽，持续这份宁静。可是，它们再次被摧毁，可能只是须臾间的事。所有的美好与安稳，都不过是一种表象。

于是人们再次回味起“水手归乡图”，只为了让自己的心不再焦虑难安。那些画景又在眼前重现，还增添了各种之前并没有利用到的细枝末节，比如她蓝色的裙子，开着黄花的树所投射的影子，等等。她轻轻拽着他的衣袖，在他背上背着一只行囊，两人站在门口。一只沙黄色的猫儿从门口偷偷溜达过去。人们会通过回忆这个画面的每一个细节而逐渐让自己相信：隐藏在表象下的，或许并不是罪恶和凶厉，而更可能是善意、满足和平静。羊群正低头吃草，山峦迭起，农舍、小狗，以及翩飞的蝴蝶——一起都宛如从前那般真实。人们一边遐想着水手与他的妻子，一边返身回家，一幕幕画景就在他们的脑海里虚构出来。人们不过是希冀那些美丽幸福的图景能掩盖住他们内心的惶恐罢了，希冀这些画景最后能够把那恐怖的哭号声给闷死，给碾压成齑粉，让它随风消散。

人们走到了每次都要经过的教堂墓园，总算是返回村庄了。如同往常一般，再次走过这片墓园时，人们会想：多么安宁的地方啊，看那紫杉葱茏，石碑被擦拭了一遍又一遍，四周围分散着多少无名者的坟墓——死亡是快乐的！人们会这样觉得。没错，看看这个画面！一个男子正在挖墓，旁边，他的孩子们正在吃东西，当他把黄土一锹一锹地铲出来时，孩子们正自由自在地蘸着果酱吃面包，捧着大牛奶罐子喝牛奶。挖墓者的妻子，一个胖乎乎的金发女郎，靠在一块墓碑边上，挖掘的墓穴旁边的草地上铺了一个围裙，当作茶桌来用。一些泥土撒落在茶具中间。我问：“谁要葬在这个墓里？难道多德森老先生终于去世了吗？”“不，不是，”那个女人回答说，“这个坟头是给年轻的水手罗杰斯挖的。”她看着我说：“两天前的夜里他就死了，说是得了什么外国的热病。你难道没有听见他妻子又哭又嚎吗？她跑到大路上哭嚎……汤米，你看看你，怎么弄得满身是土！”

这又是怎样一个画面啊！





新　装


梅布尔第一次感到满肚子疑惑，是在她将披风脱下来时，布尼特夫人给她递过来镜子，给她刷刷抹抹，这样的话，她的所有注意力都被梳妆台上的化妆工具、理发工具和整装器具给吸引走了，这进一步加重了她的疑惑——肯定有哪里不对劲，绝对是的。上楼的时候，她的疑惑愈加猛烈，愈加沉重，尤其当她向克拉丽萨·达洛维打招呼时，她几乎已经确信了。梅布尔飞奔到房间的另一头，扑进一个阴暗的角落里，那里挂着一面镜子，她赶紧照了照——看吧！真的不对劲！刹那间，那种她一直在竭力掩饰的痛苦，那种深深的不满——那种从孩童时期就产生的低人一等的自卑感——再次涌上心头，冷酷，无情，强烈到让她无法摆脱，她总是靠阅读布罗[1]或者斯科特[2]来度过无数个难寐的漫漫长夜，可这方法于它却无法奏效。因为这些男男女女会想——“梅布尔身上穿的那叫什么！她看上去真是太惊悚了！这件新的连衣裙看着就让人觉得讨厌！”——他们眨巴着眼睛走过来，而后紧紧地将它闭上。然而最令她伤心的是她本身的可怕的缺陷、她的胆怯以及她那卑贱的血统。一瞬间，这个屋子，这个她和矮个子裁缝花了无数个小时设计连衣裙样式的屋子，变得肮脏不堪、令人厌恶。就连她的客厅也寒酸起来。以前每当她出来，伸手去拿放在门厅桌上的信函时，就会炫耀地说“真是无聊啊”，虚荣心十足——现在，这所有的一切都显得那么卑微、愚蠢、土气。当她一跨进达洛维夫人的客厅时，这一切都原形毕露，化为乌有，显得毫无价值。

那天晚上，达洛维夫人的请柬送来的时候，他们正坐着喝茶，当时她想，要说赶时髦，她当然做不到。装时髦简直就是荒唐——时髦意味着款式、格调，以及至少三十几尼的花销，与其如此，为何不自己动手制作呢？这样还能有自己的独特风格。她霍然起身拿起母亲的那本老旧的出自巴黎帝国时代的时装册子，心想当然是她们更加美丽，更加有女人味，更加高雅了！要设法让自己——噢，真是愚蠢——看起来像她们一样，实际上，是在炫耀她自己端庄典雅，古朴迷人，毋庸置疑，她让自己陷入了一种应当受罚的自恋狂的状态中。这是她自作自受。

但她连镜子都不敢照一下，她无法面对现实的惨淡——浅黄色的，傻里傻气的老式丝绸连衣裙，长长的下摆，高高的袖肩，还有那腰身，明明在那本时装册子里，显得那样迷人。可一穿到自己的身上，就完全变了味儿，甚至连那些普通人都不如。她站在那里，就像裁缝店里任由年轻人乱插大头针的衣模。

“不过，亲爱的，确实漂亮！”罗丝·肖说，她翘起自己的嘴唇，带着一脸的讥讽打量了一遍又一遍。她早就料到对方会有这种举动，罗丝身上穿的从来都是最时髦的衣服，跟别人穿的不差一丁点。

我们都跟费尽心机要爬过碟沿的苍蝇一样，梅布尔想，然后她把这个想法重复了一遍，就好像在身上划着十字一般，试图去找寻一个咒语，以让这种痛楚得到缓解，变得可以忍受。当她陷入苦闷中难以自拔时，一句很久以前她在书上读到过的莎士比亚的台词突然浮现在她脑海里，她反复默念着。“竭尽全力爬窜的苍蝇！”她一次次重复着。如果她能将这句台词重复千万遍，直到令自己看到苍蝇，她就能变得麻木、淡漠、冷酷、沉默。现在她已经看见几只翅膀粘在一起的苍蝇正从奶碟里慢慢地爬出来。她竭尽全力（站在镜子前听罗丝·肖喋喋不休）让自己把罗丝·肖和在场所有人都看成是苍蝇，卑贱、软弱、辛苦忙碌的苍蝇，竭力想要从某些地方钻出来，或钻进某些东西里。可是她不仅没办法把她们看成苍蝇，反倒觉得自己这副模样才是一只苍蝇，而别人则是蝴蝶，蜻蜓，美丽的昆虫。她们拍打着翅膀，在空中飞舞，蹁跹摇曳，唯独她正竭力将自己从奶碟里拉出来。（她最主要的弊病是两种令人厌恶的恶念——怨念与妒恨！）

“我就像一只寒碜的、弱不禁风的、脏了吧唧的老苍蝇！”她说。

罗伯特·海顿停下脚步，恰好听见她的话。通过回味这句可怜兮兮的怪话，刚好能让她安心，并因此显得她语言风趣，思想高超，毫无违和感。当然，罗伯特·海顿非常礼貌地回应了一声，她早就看穿了他的口是心非。所以他刚刚走开，她就对自己说：“谎言！谎言！谎言！”（这也是某本书上的话）她想，反正这种聚会要么让事情变得更加真实，要么让事情变得更加虚假。她想她已经看穿了罗伯特·海顿的心，她把一切都看明白了。她看到了真相。这才是真的，这间客厅，这个自我，其余的一切都是假的。米兰小姐窄小闷热的工作间里乱糟糟的，有一股衣服和炖白菜的味道。但当米兰小姐将镜子递到她手上，她窥见镜中身着完工的连衣裙的自己时，一阵狂喜涌上心头。她光彩照人，一下子变得生机勃勃。摆脱了所有的顾虑和担忧，她梦寐以求的自己正站在这里——一个美丽的女人，就那么一瞬间（米兰小姐要测量清楚裙摆的长度，所以她不敢看太久），看着旋涡状纹饰的红木镜框里那个面庞粉白，露出神秘笑颜的女孩，那是她的核心，她的灵魂。这让她觉得真实，觉得美好，觉得温馨，不仅仅是虚荣和孤芳自赏。

米兰小姐说裙摆不能再加长了。硬要做什么修改的话，米兰小姐皱着眉头，苦口婆心地说，下摆有必要改短一些。她突然心血来潮，由衷地对米兰小姐心生爱意，那份喜爱远远胜过对世界上其他人的喜爱。甚至，当米兰小姐咬着几根大头针伏在地上，憋得满脸通红，眼睛都鼓起来时，因心中的怜悯之情，她的双眼泪水满溢——一个人竟能为另一个人做到这样，这让她看到眼中的人们仅仅作为人，看到自己去参加了晚上的活动，看到米兰小姐拿过盖子把金丝雀的笼子盖好或是让金丝雀叼走她唇间的一颗大麻籽。一想到它，想到人性的这一面，想到它的耐心和忍耐，和为一丁点可怜巴巴的、微不足道的小快乐就感到心满意足，她的眼中不禁噙满了眼泪。

现在，一切事物都消失了。连衣裙，客厅，怜悯，热忱，框上有旋涡状纹饰的镜子和金丝雀笼子——所有的一切都消失得无影无踪。只剩下她独自坐在达洛维太太客厅的角落里，饱受折磨，清醒地面对现实。

说起来，这未免也太懦弱，太狭隘，太小肚鸡肠了，那么在意自己的年龄和已经是两个孩子的妈妈的事情，心里有那么多顾虑，没有原则，没有信条。不能像别人一样随心所欲，想说什么就说什么。比如：“莎士比亚算什么？死亡算什么？我们全都是船长饼干里的象鼻虫[3]。”——或者任何别人可能会讲的话。

她凝视着镜中的自己，蹭了蹭左肩，跨进房间，就好像无数长矛从四面八方射向她黄色的连衣裙。但她并没有像罗丝·肖一样露出凶狠的、悲愤的表情——罗丝会露出像布狄卡[4]一样的表情——她看起来傻傻的，十分羞涩，宛如小学生一般地微笑着，漫不经心地穿过屋子，行为鬼祟，像极了一只斗败的杂种狗，眼睛盯着一幅画，一幅雕版画。就好像她参加晚宴目的就是为了看这幅画！在场的所有人都明白她为什么这样做——是耻辱、羞愤促使她这样。

“现在苍蝇就泡在奶碟里，”她对自己说，“就在奶碟的正中心，爬不出来，那奶，”她一边想，一边死死地盯着那幅画，“就要把它的翅膀粘到一起了。”

“真是太老土了。”她拦下正要去跟其他人说话的查尔斯·伯特（他最讨厌这种把人拦下来的举动），说道。

她想要表达的是，或者说她努力让自己认为她想要表达的是，那幅画，而不是她的连衣裙，真是太老土了。如果这时候查尔斯能够说上一句赞美她、关心她的话，对她而言将意义重大。只要他能说一句：“梅布尔，你今晚真漂亮！”那么她的一生都将因此而改变。但那时她就应该诚实一点，直爽一点。查尔斯没有说这种话，当然，他是恶意的化身。他总能将人一眼看透，尤其是当别人处于自卑、怯懦和迟钝的时候。

“梅布尔穿了一件新的连衣裙！”他说，可怜的苍蝇一下被推到了奶碟的中心。实际上，她觉得，他恨不得她被淹死呢。他根本没有心，没有一丁点儿善意，空有一副看似友好的外表。米兰小姐比他真实百倍，宽容千倍。如果谁能拥有并永远坚守这份感情，那该多好啊！

“为什么，”她问自己——回答查尔斯的话有些失礼，让他看出来她生气了，或者用他的话来形容叫“奓毛了”（他问：“奓毛得厉害吗？”然后同在场的一些女人们合起来嘲笑她。）——“为什么，”她问自己，“我对事物的感受，对于我十分确信米兰小姐是对的，查尔斯是错的并坚持己见这件事的感受，对于金丝雀，那份怜悯，那份爱意的感受，总不至于在走近一个挤满人的房间的瞬间就立即转变了吧？”她那变化不定、弱不禁风、令人讨厌的性格又出来捣乱了，每次都会在紧要的关头败下阵来，总是不能对贝壳学、语源学、植物学、考古学产生兴趣，不能像玛丽·丹尼斯和维奥莉特·瑟尔那样，切开土豆，观察它们的繁衍。

当豪尔曼夫人看见她站在那里时，就向她冲了过来。豪尔曼夫人当然不会过分关注一件连衣裙这样的小事，因为她的家人总是摔下楼梯或是患上猩红热。梅布尔能否告诉她八九月份艾尔姆莎普是否出租？这场谈话让她厌烦到了极致。她快要被气疯了，因为她居然被当成一个房屋销售员或信童来使唤。一点价值都没有，就是这样，她这样想。她一边很现实地回答着关于那栋房子的问题，例如浴室朝南的一面和顶层热水供应的问题，一边努力地想要抓住一点坚固的东西，一点实在的东西。整个过程中，她能从那面圆镜中看到自己身上那斑斓的黄色连衣裙，这些斑驳的东西被镜子变得像鞋扣一般小，就跟小蝌蚪似的。这么多的委屈、烦恼、自卑、不甘以及此起彼伏的情绪，都能被一件只值三便士硬币的东西给容纳，想到这个，还真是叫人难以置信。另外更让人难以置信的是，这件东西与梅布尔·韦林是相互隔离的，根本没有关联。豪尔曼夫人（那枚黑色的纽扣）身体前倾，对她讲述自己的大儿子和小儿子是如何的让她不放心。可是她从镜子里看出，她是根本没有牵挂的。尽管镜子里的那个小黑点身体前倾，手舞足蹈，可是一个自尊心那么强的小黄点坐在那里，黑点又如何能让寂寞的黄点感受到她内心的东西呢？她们都不过是强忍、伪装而已。

“想叫男孩子消停一会儿，那简直是不可能的。”大家都这样说。

豪尔曼太太有时会同情心泛滥，有时却小气地抠抠索索，就像这是她的权利一样（实际上她的小女儿今早膝关节发肿了，她理应获得更多），她接受了这份可悲的礼物，却满眼怀疑和不情愿地看着它，就好像本来她应该拿到一英镑，偏偏只拿到一个便士，却又不得不把它放进了腰包里。生活艰难，太艰难了，所以虽然有些小气，但也只能忍耐。心中委实不甘的豪尔曼夫人不厌其烦地讲述着女儿的膝关节肿胀的情况。啊，真是可悲，人的这种贪婪，这种聒噪，就像是一群拍打着翅膀呱呱乱叫的水鸭子一样，只为了博取别人的同情心——真是可悲，期望别人能感同身受一下，而不仅仅是装出一副同情的样子。

但今晚身着黄色连衣裙的她，没办法再拧出哪怕一滴同情了，她选择把所有的同情都留给自己。她知道别人在诽谤她，轻视她（她一眨不眨地看着镜子，不断地在那耀眼的蓝池中沉浮），自己就像一只因为软弱、不坚定而被扔进臭水沟里的动物，这件黄色的连衣裙在她看来等同于一种对罪恶的严酷惩罚，即便她穿上一身像罗丝·肖那样漂亮的修身天鹅绒皱边儿绿裙，她仍旧要遭受这种酷刑。绝对逃不掉的，她想，没有任何可能。不过，这终究不是她的错。谁让她的家里有十口人呢，就算再怎么精打细算，手头也永远拮据。母亲背着沉重的包袱，连楼梯边沿的油布地毡也磨破了，小灾小难一件接着一件——虽然这些都算不上什么大灾难，养羊赔钱了，但赔得不算惨烈；她大哥娶了一个出身不如他的女人，不过也没有差太多——从头到尾没有一点浪漫的色彩，所有的事都不算太过极端。

海滨胜地是他们家的人安度晚年的首选地。就说这一刻吧，无论哪一处海滨胜地，必定有她的某个姑姑躺在离海不远的寄居宿舍里。他们家的传统就是这样的——他们总是目无一切。她的表现也大抵如此——与她的姑姑们是如出一辙。她从前梦想能够居住在印度，嫁给一个如同亨利·洛伦斯[5]爵士一样的英雄或者某个帝国的杰出人物（现在亦如此，只要看到一个头上裹布条的土著，她的脑海里依然会出现许多浪漫的传奇故事），不过都没有实现。她嫁给了休伯特，一个在法院里有份稳定持久的下层工作的男人。他们住在一栋小房子里，日子勉强过得去，没有雇佣固定的女用。她一人在家的时候，就吃杂烩，或黄油面包，不过偶尔——豪尔曼夫人走开了，她肯定觉得她是一个不会打扮自己的、世上最干瘪的、缺乏同情心的木头疙瘩，她肯定会见人就谈论梅布尔的怪模怪样的打扮。

梅布尔·韦林偶尔会想，一个人被扔进那张蓝色的沙发里，用拳头在坐垫上砸出一个窝，仅仅只是为了证明现在有人占着它。她不愿意与查尔斯·伯特和罗丝·肖他们在一起，因为他们没准正在壁炉那边嘲笑她呢，就跟喜鹊一样叽叽喳喳地絮叨着。

偶尔，她也能享受到片刻舒适。近来的一个晚上，她在床上躺着看书。复活节的时候，她躺在海滩上晒太阳——让她回想一下那时候的情形——一大窝盘根错节的灰白色沙草长在那里，如长矛一样直刺苍穹，天空像是一颗坚硬而又滑溜的瓷卵，还有海浪奏出的音乐——“哗，哗……”，海浪在低声细语。孩子们正在水里嬉戏，欢快地喊啊叫啊——啊，多么神圣的一刻啊，她觉得自己躺在了世界女神的掌心中。冷酷无情但格外美艳的女神，被摆在祭坛上的羔羊。（每每孤独的时候就会想到这些愚蠢的场景，不过没有关系，别人是不会知道的。）

说起神圣的时刻，她跟休伯特在一起的时候，偶尔也会有那么片刻，比如切羊肉准备周日的午餐，走进一间屋子，毫无来由地打开一封信。那时候她对自己说（这件事她从来不会告诉别人）：“据说是这样的。它就这样发生了。就是这样的！”即便不是这样也有让人惊异的地方——当万事俱备之时——假日、天气、音乐、快乐的元素全都准备就绪时——快乐却没有发生。人是不可能快乐的。只有郁闷、沉闷的境况，不会有别的。

没错，又是她那可怜的存在感！作为母亲，她从来都软弱不堪，心情烦躁，做什么事都不肯尽心尽力。作为妻子，她的生活一塌糊涂，懒懒散散，什么都整理不清，没有一丝亮点，和她的兄弟姐妹相差无几，除了赫伯特之外——他们都是一丘之貉，卑贱的可怜虫。当她在生活中匍匐前进时，冷不丁地便被推到了风口浪尖上。那只卑微的苍蝇——这个念念不忘的有关苍蝇和奶碟的故事她是从哪里看来的？——挣扎了出来。没错，她也曾享受过这样的时刻。可而今四十多岁了，这样的时刻会越来越稀少。最可悲的是，以后慢慢地她将无力挣扎。这种状况让她无法忍受！她感到无比的自卑！

她打算明天去趟伦敦图书馆，她会十分偶然地发现一本神奇的，对她有帮助的，令人惊诧的书，作者是一位牧师，一个根本不出名的美国人。或者，她将出去散步，沿着海滨路，不经意间走进一个大厅里，那里正有一个矿工讲述他在矿窑里的经历。她会摇身一变，成为一个崭新的人，她要彻底改变。她会穿上一套制服，被人们尊称为“大姐”，以后再也不必为穿什么衣服劳心费神了。关于查尔斯·伯特、米兰小姐、这个房间或那个房间的一切，她都将了解得清清楚楚，每一天都将如此，就好像躺着晒太阳或切羊肉一样。一定会如此的！

于是，她从蓝色沙发上起身，镜子里的那枚黄色纽扣也站起来了，她朝查尔斯和罗丝挥了挥手，她的意思是，她根本就不会依赖他们。那枚黄色纽扣彻底从镜子里走了出来，当她走向达洛维夫人并道“晚安”的时候，所有的矛头齐齐射向她的胸口。

“现在就走吗？时间还早着呢！”美丽动人的达洛维夫人说。

“我怕是必须要离开了，但是——”梅布尔·韦林说，“但——”她用怯生生的颤抖的声音继续说，“我今晚过得非常开心。”当她用力地发出这个声音的时候，听起来是那么可笑。

她在楼梯上遇上了达洛维先生，她对他说：“今晚我过得很开心！”

“撒谎！都是谎言！全都是谎言！”她一边对自己说，一边走下楼。

“正好在奶碟里！”她一边对自己说，一边感谢布尼特夫人的帮助，而后将自己层层包裹进那件她已经穿了二十年的中国式披风中。

热爱同类者的人


布里克特·阿里斯在那天下午跑过院长院[1]时，极其意外地撞上了理查德·达洛维。说得准确一点，应该是两人正要彼此错过时，却相互偷偷扭头从帽檐底下瞄了对方一眼，然后十分意外地认出了对方。他们以前是同学，已经有二十年没有见面了。阿里斯现在做什么行当？是律师吗？当然是啦，当然是啦，因为他总是对报纸上的案件特别感兴趣。这里显然不是说话的地方，他为什么不来参加晚上的聚会呢（他们就住在街角，还是老地方）？有些人会参加，十有八九乔恩森会来。“现在可是家喻户晓的人物了。”理查德说。

“好啦！——晚上再见啦。”理查德说，并继续向前走，“特别开心”（这话倒不假）碰上那个怪里怪气的家伙，一点都没变，跟他上学那会儿一模一样，还是过去那样胖墩墩的，圆乎乎的，浑身都长着刺儿。不过真不是一般的聪明，还获得过纽卡斯尔奖。瞧——他走了。

布里克特·阿里斯转过身来，注视着达洛维的背影渐渐消失时，心里宁愿自己没有遇见他，至少，不该答应参加今晚的聚会，因为他一直喜欢着他。达洛维已经结婚了，他经常举办晚会；他们根本就是没有交集的两个人。他还得穿上礼服。但，等到夜幕降临，他暗自琢磨，如他所言，他不想显得太没礼貌，他必须前去赴约。

可是这种娱乐活动实在叫人不安！连向来话不投机的乔恩森也在那儿，这个家伙本来就特别自负，到后来就更是越来越狂妄，他就是这样一个人。可是除了他，整个屋子里再不会有布里克特·阿里斯所认识的人了，一个也没有。他总不能够不跟达洛维打声招呼就立马走人吧。可是穿着一身白马甲的达洛维为了尽地主之谊正忙得不可开交，心思根本不会放到别的地方上来。他只能一个人干巴巴地站在那里。这类事真令他反胃。仔细想一想，那些已经步入成年人行列，富有责任感的男男女女，几乎每天都在做这类事情！他靠墙站着，一句话也不说。剃须时他把脸刮得红一块紫一块，显得皱纹更深了。尽管他干活儿的时候，像头牛一样卖力，可是他还是特别注重锻炼，对身体健康特别上心。他看上去坚毅而凶猛，他的小胡子上像是沾了霜一样，头发直直地竖起来，一副气冲冲的样子。他穿的那身看上去邋里邋遢的礼服是廉价货，衬得他更加呆板生硬，毫无地位。

这些高雅的女士们和先生们，穿着极其华丽的衣着，头脑简单，没完没了地说说笑笑，简直无聊极了。布里克特·阿里斯观察着这些人，将他们跟布鲁纳夫妇做比较。当初，布鲁纳夫妇与芬纳啤酒厂打了一场官司，赢得官司后对方赔付了他们两百英镑（连应得的赔偿金的一半都不到），他们就买了一只五英镑的钟送给他。那件事做得相当得体，令他感动不已。他变得更加苛刻，死死地盯着这些人，穿着过分讲究，待人尽显刻薄，享受荣华富贵。他拿现在的这种感受同那天上午十一点时的感受相对比，那天，正直而可敬的布鲁纳夫妇穿着他们最漂亮的衣服前来拜访他，并送了他老布鲁纳口中的小纪念品，老人直挺挺地站着，像发表演说似的向他表示感谢和敬佩。他说，您替我们把官司打得这么漂亮，然后布鲁纳夫人脱口而出，他是他们的大功臣。他们非常感谢他的慷慨无私——当然，这是因为他没有向他们收取律师费。

他放下手里的钟，把它摆放在壁炉架的中央。他觉得，自己不愿意让别人看见自己的脸的。这是自己应得的酬劳——是通过工作得来的。看着眼前的这群人，他又想起了发生在律师事务所里的那一幕，而它现在成了这群人的舞台，并将他们暴露出来。当这一场景消失时——布鲁纳夫妇也消失了——仿佛那一场景只剩下了他自己，面对着这群满怀敌意的人。他不过是一个社会底层的人（他挺直了腰板），没见过世面，普普通通，穿着劣质的衣服，瞪着一双充满怒火的眼睛，毫无绅士风度。他只是一个十分平庸的人，一个很普通的人，一个连真实感情都不懂得如何隐藏的人，他愤世嫉俗，看不惯社会上的堕落和冷酷。他一刻也不想在这里多待了。现在他戴上眼镜，将目光转向那些画作。他念着那排书的书名，多半都是些诗集。莎士比亚，狄更斯——他非常愿意再回味一遍以前就特别喜欢的那些作品，他一直希望能抽时间去趟国家美术馆，可是从来也没办法践行——没办法，真的没办法，他办不到——这种情况是这个世界的普遍现象。当成天都有人需要你的帮助，吵吵嚷嚷来找你帮忙时，真的办不到的。目前还不是追求奢华的时候。他望了望扶手椅、精致的书册和裁纸刀，摇了摇头，他明白自己恐怕这一生都不会有时间并且有那份心情、有那么多钱去享受那种奢华。要是这里的人们知道他抽着多少钱的烟丝，了解到他怎么去借用别人的衣服，铁定会一惊一乍的。不过，他也有一件奢侈品，唯一的一件，就是那艘漂浮在诺福克宽阔河段上的小快艇。他允许自己拥有一件享乐品。确实，每年，他都喜欢享受一段离开所有人，独自仰躺在田野上的时光。他想，这些高雅人士该会多惊讶地发现，他是如何自得其乐，老派到去热爱大自然，热爱那些从孩童时代就已经熟识的树木和原野。

这些高雅人士绝对会震惊到无以复加的。实际上，当他站在那里，摘掉眼镜，把它装进衣兜里时，他感觉自己每一刻都在变得越来越令人震惊。这种感觉真的让人很不舒服。他感觉不到自己喜欢人类，他只抽五便士一盎司的烟草，他热爱的是大自然——毫不矫揉造作，默默地爱着。所有的喜悦都化成了不满。他想，他之所以需要站出来为自己辩护，正是因为这些他所轻视的人。他一次次地说：“我是个普通人。”可是接下来的话让他不好意思说出口，但他还是说了出来：“但我每天为与我一样的人们所做的事，比你们一辈子做的事加起来还要多。”他实在控制不住自己；他不停地回忆着从前的那些经历，诸如布鲁纳夫妇送钟给他的那件事——他不断地用那些美好的事提醒自己，那些人们所称赞的他的善良、慷慨，以及他如何帮助别人。一直以来，他都把自己看成是人类的仆人，脱离愚昧，脱离狭隘。他多么想大声地将人们对他的赞誉背出来。他感觉自己是那么的善良，这种感觉在他的心里不停地翻涌，让他感觉越来越不舒服。更可恶的是，他没有办法将人们对他的评价讲给任何一个人听。感谢上帝！他不停地念叨着——明天我就能回去继续工作。然而，他已经不再甘心于现在就从那扇门偷偷地溜出去，逃回家。他必须待下去，必须待到为自己申辩后才能走。可是他能等到这样一个机会吗？这个房间里的人，他并不知道该对何人说。

终于，理查德·达洛维走了过来。

“我来介绍一下，这位是奥吉弗小姐。”他说。奥吉弗小姐是个三十多岁的女人，她盯着他的眼睛，一眨也不眨。这个女人傲慢无礼，莽撞轻浮。

奥吉弗小姐想要点冰淇淋或者饮料，叫布里克特·阿里斯替她去取。阿里斯觉得她这种傲慢的行为太过失礼了。而她之所以这样做，是因为她曾在某个热浪炎炎的午后，看见一个女人带着两个小孩趴在广场的栏杆上往里边看，贫穷和困顿正折磨着他们。她看见他们后，心中的怜悯像潮水一般汹涌澎湃，心想，能让他们进来吗？不，她立马又愤慨起来，把自己狠狠地责备了一顿，恨不得扇自己一耳光。整个世界都救不了他们。所以她捡起一只网球，大力丢了回去。她极为愤慨，说，整个世界都救不了他们。所以，她才会向一个陌生男人发号施令：“给我拿些冰淇淋过来。”

布里克特·阿里斯在她旁边站着，等她吃完冰淇淋还早着呢。他什么都没吃，他跟她说，他已经十五年没有参加过晚宴了，这身礼服是从他妹夫那里借来的，他对这些东西不感兴趣。假如她允许他继续说下去，让他证明自己是个普通人，就喜欢与普通人相处，那他一定会感到非常畅快，那么接下来他就会为她讲（后来又感觉讲这件事有点难为情）布鲁纳夫妇与那只钟的故事。可是她却说——

“你有没有看过《暴风雨》[2]？”

然后（他没有看过《暴风雨》）就问他有没有读过什么书？还是没有。于是，她把手里的冰淇淋放下来，他从来没有读过诗吗？

布里克特·阿里斯从心里头冒出一个东西来，这个东西将把这个年轻女人的头砍下来，让她成为受害者，杀掉她。他让她坐在那儿，一个无人打扰他们的地方，空空如也的花园里的两把椅子上。树叶摇摆，一两只猫偷偷从草坪溜达过去，红色的、黄色的果子像灯笼一样摇曳着，人们都聚在楼上，各种嘈杂的声音都钻进你的耳朵里。仿佛一个幽灵管弦乐队正在为园中的这些东西进行疯狂的伴奏。这场谈话就像一段狂乱的基干舞曲，为某种异乎寻常的真实和煎熬所伴奏。

“太漂亮了！”奥吉弗小姐说。

实在是太美了。在客厅里待了一段时间，忍耐够那样的喧嚣后，再来到这块小小的绿草坪里，看着耸立在高空的黑黢黢的威斯敏斯特的塔楼将它包围在中央，这里显得那么寂静。毕竟，他们还有这一切——那个困顿不堪的女人和那两个孩子。

布里克特·阿里斯把烟斗点上。烟斗里装进去的自然是廉价烟丝——五便士就能买一盎司，这会使得她感到无比震惊。他抽着烟丝，想象着自己独自一人躺在那条小船里抽烟，他能够看到自己，在黑夜的星光下抽着烟斗。假如这些人来看他，他会是一副什么模样？一整个晚上他在想这个问题。他拿着一根火柴，随手在鞋底上划了一下。这里实在看不出有什么漂亮的东西，他跟奥吉弗小姐说。

“或许，”奥吉弗小姐说，“你根本不在乎美。”（因为他说过他没有看过《暴风雨》，他甚至没有读过什么书。他给人印象最深的就是胡须、下巴和银表链，整个人看上去邋里邋遢。）在她看来，这是免费的。博物馆和国家美术馆都可以免费参观，当然，还有乡村。她也清楚各种反驳的借口，比如做饭、洗衣服、看孩子，可是一切的根源不外乎是快乐根本不值钱，只不过人们不愿说出来而已。“美”这种东西，你可以不花一分钱就能享受到。

布里克特·阿里斯让她尽管享受——这个面无血色，傲慢无礼，冒冒失失的女人。他一边向她诉说着自己在那天做了些什么，一边抽着他的廉价烟丝。六点钟便从床上爬起来，然后是接连不断的会面，在一个肮脏不堪的贫民窟忍受着臭水沟里散发出来的恶臭，之后就去了法庭。

说到这里的时候他犹豫了片刻，本来想讲一些自己的成就给她听，不过最后这种冲动被他强压了下去，他变得更加尖酸刻薄。他说他无法忍受那些成天只知道饱食终日、服饰奢华的女人们谈论美。（她的嘴唇动了动。她很瘦，她的衣服算不上华贵。）

“美！”他说，他怕是永远也理解不了脱离了人的美。

他们的目光出神地望着这个空无一人的花园。灯光恍恍惚惚，有一只猫抬起一只前爪，看起来像是在犹豫什么。

什么叫脱离人的美？他是什么意思？她忽然发问。

这个：他把布鲁纳夫妇与那只钟的故事讲了出来，越说越亢奋，心里面的自豪感再也掩饰不住了。那就是美，他说。

她无法用言语来描述他的故事给她带来的惊骇。首先他是那么自以为是；其次讲到人类情感时，他以粗俗野蛮的言辞来亵渎它；他用一个故事来证明他热爱同类，世界上又有哪一个人会这样做？然而，他讲述着那个故事，讲到那位老人如何站着向他致辞时，她眼眶里流出了热泪，要是曾有人告诉过她这个故事该多好啊！然而，又一次，她感觉，正是这一点致使人类备受谴责。诸如送钟这一类感人的场景，人们永远也无法超越。布鲁纳夫妇向布里克特·阿里斯这一类人致感谢辞，布里克特·阿里斯这一类人每每就会说他们多么热爱自己的同类。他们自始至终都会不思进取，相互妥协下去，对美有种畏惧感。然后自此时起，由畏惧、懒惰以及对这类感人场景的热爱为源泉，就会产生一场变革。这个男人一如既往需要从布鲁纳夫妇这类人身上获得满足感，而她一如既往要从那些被禁止进入广场的可怜的穷女人身上获得痛苦。他们谁都不说话，只是坐在那里。他们都不快乐。布里克特·阿里斯并没有从自己所说的话里得到任何快慰。至于她身上的尖刺，他非但没有把它们拔出来，反而还又摁进去了一些。他早晨时的快乐已荡然无存。奥吉弗小姐也极为懊恼，她被搞得头昏脑涨，她更糊涂了，更加搞不明白了。

“我只是所有热爱自己的同类的最普通的人当中的一个。”他站起身，说道。

听到这句话奥吉弗小姐几乎就要脱口嚷道：“我也是。”

这两个热爱自己同类的人站起来。他们憎恨对方，也憎恨那个屋子里的所有人，因为是他们营造了这个让人煎熬、让人幻想破灭的夜晚。他们不多说一句话，永远分手了。

拉平与拉平诺娃


他们结婚了！婚礼进行曲悠然响起。鸽子拍打着翅膀，纷纷飞向天空。穿着伊顿式外套[1]的男童们扬洒着谷米。一只狐犬从小道上跑了过去。欧内斯特·瑟伯恩挽着他的新娘，穿过观礼的人群，朝着汽车走去。这些人都是一群素不相识的人，他们总是在伦敦聚集，欣赏着别人的幸福或者舛讹。毫无疑问，新郎英俊潇洒，新娘娇羞恬静。谷米又飞扬了片刻，随后汽车便开走了。

那是礼拜二的事。今天已经礼拜六了。罗莎琳达已经是欧内斯特·瑟伯恩夫人了，可她还是不太适应这个事实，或许她永远也无法适应自己是欧内斯特·某某夫人这个事实，她想。

这时候，她正在旅馆的弓形飘窗前静坐，目光从湖面游离到山峦，她在等待着丈夫下楼吃早餐。这是一个令她很难适应的名字——欧内斯特，她不喜欢这个名字，甚至即便是迪莫希、安东尼或彼得，都比这个名字要好。何况，他看起来一点儿也不像欧内斯特。说起这个名字，她总会联想到艾伯特纪念馆，联想到放置餐具的红木橱柜，以及雕刻着亲王和他家人的钢板画——也就是她婆婆位于帕彻斯特大街的餐厅。

但此刻他就在这儿。真是感谢上帝，他并没有欧内斯特的那种做派！一点都没有！但是他看起来像什么呢？她用眼角的余光打量着他，哦，他吃烤面包片时的样子，倒是像极了一只兔子。

欧内斯特有一双湛蓝的眼睛，高挺的鼻梁，棱角分明的嘴角，无疑是一个俊朗壮硕的青年，任谁也不会把他和身体小小的，胆子怯怯的兔子联想到一块儿。但有意思的是，他吃东西的时候，鼻子会微微翕动。跟她那只宠物兔一样。她目不转睛地注视着他那不断翕动的鼻子。当他觉察到她的目光时，她只好笑着跟他解释她为什么会笑。

“因为你看起来像极了一只兔子，欧内斯特，”她说，“像只野兔，”她看着他，继续说，“一只猎兔，一只兔子王，一只为其他兔子制定法规的兔子。”

欧内斯特并不反感充当那样一只兔子。既然自己抽动鼻子可以逗乐她——他从来不知道自己的鼻子能翕动——他索性故意翕动起来。她乐不可支，他也同样笑得合不拢嘴。因此，那几个老小姐和那名渔夫，以及那个穿着油腻腻的黑色短褂子的瑞士仆人都猜对了，他们非常幸福。可是，这种幸福能持续多长时间呢？他们暗问自己。又根据自身的情况各自做了回答。

午餐时间，他们坐在湖边的一片欧石楠上，罗莎琳达伸手拿着裹老鸡蛋吃的生菜说：“兔子，想吃生菜吗？”她接着又说：“来，我喂你吃。”他就把脖子伸过来，一边咀嚼着生菜，一边翕动着鼻子。

“好兔儿，真乖！”她如平素拍自己那只温顺的兔子一般拍着他说道。不过显然有点不合情理，他怎么看都算不上是一只温顺的兔子，所以她又用兔子的法语“拉拼”（Lapin）来称呼他，不过还是不合情理，他也绝不是一只法国兔子，他是个纯粹的英国人。他出生在帕彻斯特大街，上学在拉格比[2]，如今是王室行政部门的一名职员。所以她又改叫他“胖尼”（Bunny）。这就更不合适了。“胖尼”是形容那些胖墩墩，软趴趴，有些滑稽的人的，而他硬朗，匀称，庄重严肃。他的鼻子仍然在翕动。“拉平（Lappin）！”她惊喜地喊出。然后低声欢呼，终于找到了那个苦苦求索的词。

“拉平！拉平！拉平王！”她一遍遍念叨着。这似乎正好适合他！从此他不再是欧内斯特了，而是拉平王！至于为什么，她也不知道。

当他们默不作声地散着步，许久也没有新鲜的话题可讨论时——天空飘起了雨，之前每个人都警告他们说要下雨；或者是在凄清寒夜，他们坐在火炉旁，老小姐们与渔夫都已离开，仆人也只有在你按铃的时候才会出现时，她就会肆意遐想关于拉平部落的故事。在她的手里——她正在做针线活儿，他正在看报——他们变得格外鲜活，格外生动有趣。欧内斯特放下手中的报纸过来帮她。黑兔子，红兔子；友好的兔子，敌对的兔子；荒凉的大草原，幽僻的沼泽，还有他们居住的森林——最关键的是，拉平王在这里！他可不光只会抽鼻子，他会的玩意儿多着呢！随着时间的推移，他成了一只品德极为高尚的动物，而罗莎琳达总能在他身上发现新的品质。还有一点更为重要，他还是一只伟大的猎兔。

蜜月的最后一天，罗莎琳达问他：“国王今天做什么了？”

实际上，他们今天整整一天都在爬山，她的脚都磨出了水泡。但她显然不是说这个。

“今天啊，”欧内斯特翕动着鼻子咬掉了雪茄头，“他去追一只野兔了。”他顿了顿，划着一根火柴，然后又抽了抽鼻子，补充道：“一只母野兔！”

“一只白野兔！”就像是她早就料到了一样，罗莎琳达大声说，“更准确地说，是一只银灰色的、眼睛大大的小野兔？”

“没错！”欧内斯特说，他凝望着她，就如之前她凝望他时的样子，“一只脑袋上突起圆溜溜的大眼睛，耷拉着两只小前爪的小可怜。”她正是这样坐着的。手里举着针线，悬在那里；眼睛大大的，亮晶晶的，确实有一点小突起。

“哇喔！拉平诺娃！”罗莎琳达喃喃道。

“这是她的名字吗？”欧内斯特说，“原来这才是罗莎琳达的真名！”他望着她，觉得自己深深地爱着她。

“没错！”罗莎琳达说，“拉平诺娃！这才是她的名字！”于是，事情就在当晚休息前定了下来。他是拉平国王，她是拉平诺娃王后；他们的性格截然相反，他坚强、勇敢，她胆小、谨慎、需要依赖别人；他管理着忙忙碌碌的兔子世界，而她的世界是个清幽而神秘的地方，她常常漫步于那个世界的月光之下；但他们的领地依然连在一起；他是国王，她是王后。

于是，当他们的蜜月之旅结束后，他们便拥有了一片私密的世界。这里除了一只白兔是野兔外，其他都是家兔。没有人能想到会有这样一个地方，这也使这个地方变得更加有趣。他们如同在与整个外部世界作战，有着强烈的联盟感，这种感觉比其他任何一对年轻夫妻都强烈。每当别人提及诸如兔子、森林、打猎、陷阱等字眼时，他们就会暗地里互相挤眉弄眼；或是当玛丽姑妈说她觉得兔子就像一个婴儿一样，所以不忍心看见它们成为桌上餐时，他们就会隔着餐桌悄悄地眉来眼去；又或者是当欧内斯特那个爱好运动的弟弟约翰，告诉他们威尔特郡当年秋季兔子——连毛带皮一起卖——的价格时，他们也会偷偷用眼神交流。有时候，出于一种玩闹的心态，他们还会用“偷猎者”“庄园主”“猎场巡守”等名称来指代他们的朋友。不过所有的这些都是他们两人的秘密，这是无比重要的，除了他们俩之外，世界上再没有其他人知道有这样一个世界的存在。

罗莎琳达不知道，如果没有这个世界的存在，她将如何度过那样一个冬天。例如，在庆祝金婚纪念日的晚会上，瑟伯恩一家人全部来到帕彻斯特大街，祝贺那对结婚五十周年的幸福夫妇——他们不是生下了欧内斯特·瑟伯恩吗？而且简直是硕果累累——他们还有九个孩子，其中大都不是已经成婚且有了自己的儿女了吗？这样的一场聚会让她感到不踏实，可是又不可避免。上楼的时候，她甚至有些痛苦，感觉自己是个独苗，是个孤儿，是贴着闪闪发光的缎纹壁纸和挂着熠熠生辉的历代祖先肖像画的大客厅里瑟伯恩家族众多成员中的一粒尘埃。现在还活着的瑟伯恩家族的人，都跟画像上的祖先长得一样，仅有的差别是他们的嘴巴是真实的，而不是画上去的。他们的嘴一刻不停，要么讲着笑话，要么讲着上学时候的趣事，比如他们怎么把女老师坐着的椅子抽掉，又怎么在老小姐们干干净净的被罩里藏只青蛙。而她呢，她甚至都没有做过一次苹果派的底托。她手持礼物去见公公婆婆。婆婆穿着一身名贵的绸缎衣服，公公别着明黄色的康乃馨。各种耀眼的礼物摆放在他们四周的桌椅上，有的用棉衬盖着，有的就散乱地摆在那里——烛台，雪茄烟盒，链子，金光闪闪的，所有的物件都有金匠的标记，以证明是正品纯金，品质保证，真真正正。而她的礼物只是一个小巧的、上面有个小孔的假金盒子；一件洒沙器，十八世纪的老古物，从前用它来把沙子撒在未干的墨迹上。一件一点用处也没有的礼物，她觉得——这个年代人们都用吸墨纸了。当她把这件礼物献上去时，她想起了他们订婚时婆婆用粗短的黑体字表示的祝福：“我的儿子会给你幸福。”可是，她并不幸福，一点儿也不幸福。她望向欧内斯特，他笔直地站着，他的鼻子就跟那些画像上的鼻子是一样的，根本不是一个会抽动的鼻子。

接着，他们去楼下吃晚餐。硕大的菊花，所有的花瓣，金色的，红色的，都向内卷着，卷成一个紧巴巴的圆球，而她就躲在花球后面，只让自己露出一半。所有的一切都是金黄的。菜单也是金边卡片，上面的菜名首字母是金色的花体字。菜一道接着一道摆在他们面前，她把汤勺伸进一盘澄澈的金色液体里。盘子的边缘被一张金黄色的网映衬得模糊不清，连带着菠萝也多了一层凹凸不平的金皮，那张金网是屋子外阴冷潮湿的白雾被灯光照射形成的。

只有她，一身素白的结婚礼服，一双眼睛鼓突突的，望着前方，宛如一根无法融化的冰柱。

房间里的空气随着晚宴的进行变得热烘烘的，汗珠子从那些男士们的额头上冒出来。她觉得连她这根冰柱都要融化成水了，她正在融化，消失，化作一团青烟。她就要晕过去了。她耳朵里的声音乱糟糟的，脑海里的思绪也乱糟糟的，她听见一个女人在大声说话：“他们本来就是这么延续香火的！”

瑟伯恩家族的人——是的，他们就是这么延续香火的，她重复道。她快要坚持不住了，感觉头晕目眩，那些处于亢奋中的圆脸在她的眼中从一张晃成两张，在环绕的金色迷雾中逐渐变大。“他们本来就是这么延续香火的！”然后她听见约翰大声吵吵：“小家伙们——瞅准它们开枪！用你们的靴子踩！对付它们就得这样……兔子！”

她突然就清醒了过来，因为她听见了那个字眼，那个魔力非凡的字眼！透过那些菊花，她看见欧内斯特抽动着他的鼻子，一个劲地抽动着，如同一叠叠细微的波浪。然后神奇诡秘的灾难降临了，降临在了瑟伯恩家族人们的头上。金灿灿的餐具变了样子，变成了一片荒野，上面盛开着成片的金雀花；喧嚣的声音变了，变成了云雀的欢快叽啾，飘荡在天空之上。湛蓝的天空上，云朵悠悠飘过。瑟伯恩家族的人，全都变了样子——她看向她的公公，那个染了胡子的贼眉鼠眼的矮个子男人。他有一个癖好，喜欢收藏各种各样的东西，诸如图章、搪瓷盒，他还背着妻子在书房的抽屉里收藏了十八世纪梳妆台上用的各种小玩意儿。可是现在，他在她的眼睛里原形毕露了，原来他是——一个偷猎者，他把野鸡和鹧鸪塞进他的衣服里，直到鼓起来他才偷偷溜走，然后又悄悄把它们塞进小屋里被烟熏得发黑的三足锅里。这才是她公公的真面目——一个偷猎者！还有西莉亚，那个尚未出嫁的小姑子，她总爱探听别人的秘密，那些人们希望能够隐藏的小事情——她是一只有着粉色眼睛、白色毛皮的雪貂，鼻尖上还遗留着在地下打洞时沾上的泥土。被一只网兜住，而后甩到男人的肩膀上，再塞入一个洞里——一种多么可悲的生活——西莉亚的生活。可是这不能怪她，西莉亚在她的眼中就是这样的。她又望向她的婆婆，人们冠以她“庄园主”的称号。她面色红润，举止粗俗，是个悍妇——现在她站在那里向别人回谢时就是这副样子。可是罗莎琳达——不，是拉平诺娃看见了她，注意到了她身后那座破败的家宅，一块块灰泥正从墙壁上脱落下来，她抽抽噎噎，感谢孩子们塞给她一个早已子虚乌有的世界（他们对她只有恨）。她耳朵中的这些声音戛然而止。人们都举起了酒杯，将杯中酒一口喝下去。然后这样的场景结束了。

“啊，拉平国王！”她嚷道，当他们一起在迷雾走回家时，“要是那个时候你的鼻子没有抽动，我铁定会掉进陷阱里！”

“你这不是一切都安好吗！”拉平国王轻握着她的爪子，说道。

“一切安好！”她说。

他们开车回家，穿过公园，穿过沼泽国度、迷雾国度、荆豆飘香的荒野的国王和王后。

时光荏苒，一年，两年。冬天的某一个夜晚，这一天恰好是上次金婚宴会的周年纪念日——但雷金纳德·瑟伯恩夫人已经去世了，那栋房子正打算租出去，现在只住着一个看门者——欧内斯特下班回到家里，他们在南肯辛顿有了自己的温暖小屋，那是一家马具商店楼上的半层屋子，离地铁站不远。那天大雾弥漫，格外寒冷。罗莎琳达正坐在炉火边上缝补衣物。

“你猜我今天干吗了？”当他坐下来，把脚伸近炉火时，她立即滔滔不绝地讲起来，“我正从小溪蹚过去，当——”

“什么小溪？”欧内斯特打断了她，问道。

“就是我们的森林与黑森林交汇的地方，那条幽僻的小溪。”她解释道。

欧内斯特一脸迷惑，不解其意。

“你究竟在说什么呀？”他问道。

“我亲爱的欧内斯特！”她忽然情绪激动起来，惶恐不安地叫嚷道，“拉平国王！”她补充道，一对小前爪停顿在半空中。但他没有抽动他的鼻子。她的手——她的爪子变成了手——紧紧攥着手中的针线活儿。她的眼睛从头上鼓突起来。足足过了五分钟，欧内斯特·瑟伯恩才变成拉平国王。等待的时间里，她感觉自己的脖子上压着什么东西，就好像有人要将它拧断似的，不过他总算是变回了拉平国王，他的鼻子抽动着。他们像往常一样在树林中散步，度过了这个夜晚。

但她睡得并不安稳。半夜惊醒后，她总觉得自己身上发生了什么怪事，浑身僵硬，冰冷。

她把灯打开，欧内斯特就在她的身边睡着。能听到他的呼噜声，他睡得很香。可是，他在打呼噜的时候，鼻子却一下也不抽动，就像是这个鼻子从来也没有抽动过一样。他真的是欧内斯特吗？她真的嫁给了欧内斯特吗？曾在婆婆餐厅里出现的那些影像又浮现在她的脑海——他们坐在一起，欧内斯特跟她都已经老了，他们坐在餐具橱前面，头上就是钢雕画像……那一天是他们的结婚纪念日。她实在无法忍受了。

“拉平，拉平国王！”她轻声呼唤，他仍旧沉睡，只是鼻子像是自动翕动了一下，“醒一醒，拉平！醒一醒！”她喊道。

“怎么啦？”欧内斯特醒了，看见她笔直地坐在一旁，问道。

“我觉得，我的兔子死了！”她抽咽着说。欧内斯特恼怒了。

“不要胡说了，罗莎琳达，”他说，“赶紧睡觉吧。”

他翻过身去，很快又睡着了，呼噜声再次响起。

但她睡不着。她蜷缩着身子躺在另一边，就像一只缩在洞里的兔子。她关了灯，街上的灯光打在天花板上，映出一张带有花边的网，那是房子外的树影，看起来就像是幽暗的小树林出现在了天花板上。她行走在那个树林里，曲曲折折，拐来绕去，反反复复，追逐着，被追逐着，号角的呜呜声，猎犬的狂吠声，奔跑，逃亡……直到女用把窗帘拉开，送来了他们的早茶。

接下来的一天她无论做什么都感到不踏实，总觉得有什么东西遗失了一样。她感觉自己的身体仿佛缩小了，不光缩小了，而且黑沉沉的，硬邦邦的，就连关节也僵硬了。当她照镜子时，在住所闲逛时她每天都要照好几回，她的眼睛就像小面包上的葡萄干，好像要从脑袋里鼓出来了。房间也好像萎缩了，角落里的大家具像是要鼓出来了，她一个劲地跌跌撞撞。她戴上帽子，离开了这所房子。她行走在克伦威尔大街上，她觉得所有自己经过的房屋都变成了餐厅，里面挂着厚厚的带着花边的金灿灿的窗帘，屋里摆着红木餐具橱，人们正在钢雕画下进餐。她走到自然历史博物馆，她小时候就特别喜欢这里。可是进去后首先映入眼帘的，却是一只野兔的标本。它站在人造雪上，有一双粉红色的玻璃眼睛。她整个身体不明所以地颤抖起来，或许等到太阳落山后就会好些吧。她返回家中，没有开灯，在炉火边上坐下，全身心地投入到遐想中——自己独自一人走出家门，坐在荒野里，一条小溪从身旁奔流而过，小溪的对面是一片幽暗的树林。她怎么也蹚不过那条小溪，最终她只能蹲在溪岸边湿漉漉的草地上——实际是蜷缩在椅子里，耷拉着两只空荡荡的手。她的眼睛伴随着火光不停地闪烁着，宛如玻璃一般。突然传来“砰”的一声枪响……她吓得一激灵，如同是自己中弹了一样。实际只是欧内斯特开门转动钥匙时发出的声音。

她的身体颤抖着，等待着。他走进屋子，将灯打开。这个高大挺拔、英俊威武的男人站在那儿，揉搓着自己冻得发红的双手。

“怎么坐着不开灯啊？”他说。

“啊，欧内斯特！欧内斯特！”她大喊着从椅子上蹦起来。

“嗯，怎么啦？”他一边烤手，一边漫不经心地问。

“拉平诺娃……”她惶恐不安地看了他一眼，结结巴巴地说，“她走了！我把她给丢了，欧内斯特！”

欧内斯特皱紧了眉头。他嘴唇紧闭。“噢？就因为这个，是吗？”

他对妻子笑了笑，笑容是那么冰冷。接下来的十秒钟，他站在那里一动不动，一言不发。她等待着，她感觉脖子上的那双手越掐越紧了。

“是啊，”最后，他说道，“可怜的拉平诺娃——”边说边对着壁炉架上的镜子整了整领带。

“跌进陷阱里，”他说，“死掉了。”他坐下来，开始看报纸。

于是，这一段婚姻从此消亡了。

坚实之物


如圆弧般的海滩，一望无垠，上面有一个微不可查的黑点在移动。当它与搁浅的沙丁鱼船的船肋和船脊越来越近时，黑影某些纤薄的地方显露出来，原来这个点长着四条腿，到后来，越来越明显了，原来这个点是由两个青年男子的身体组成的。即便相比沙滩而言，他们只是一个轮廓，但他们显得非常富有活力，他们时而互相接近，时而又互相避退，展现出一种难以言喻的活力。这两个圆溜溜的小脑袋上的更小的嘴，正在互相争辩着什么，虽然动作十分轻微，却显然十分激烈。如果近一些，你可以看到，右边的一根手杖正反复地戳击，这足以证明这一点。“你准备跟我说……实际上你相信……”右边那根离海浪最近的手杖就如在做这样的认定，在沙滩上拖出一条长长的直线。

“该死的政权！”左边的身体言词清晰地说，他在说这句话的时候，这两个对话者的嘴巴、鼻子、下巴和小胡子，以及呢绒花纹帽、粗布鞋、猎装、花格袜子都变得清晰起来。烟雾从二人的烟斗中蹿出袅袅腾空，这两具身体是如此的健壮硬朗，如此的活力四射，身姿雄健，汗毛浓密，肤色通红，在这片广阔无垠的海洋和沙丘上，没有任何东西能与其媲美。

他们扑到黑色沙丁渔船的六根船肋和船脊上。你知道当身体从争论中脱身，并为一种慷慨激昂的情绪道歉时是什么样子的；呈一种松懈瘫软的姿态扑在地上，思索着找些新的玩意儿来玩耍——无论什么趁手的东西都行。因此查尔斯在挥动手杖击打了半英里的海岸之后，开始拿石头片子打水漂。约翰则开始徒手挖沙子，刚才那句“该死的政权”正是出自他的口中。当沙坑深度超过手腕，他不得不往高撸了撸袖子，本来深邃的眼神已然不再，更确切地说那种给予成年人的眼神一种难以揣度的深度的思想和阅历的背景消失了，只剩下一览无余的空洞表面和稚童的眼睛里常有的那种好奇，挖沙子的举动十有八九与此有关。他记得，挖了片刻，便有水从指间附近渗出来，于是沙坑变成了一条沟，一口井，一汪泉，一条通向大海的隐秘渠道。他的手指依然在水里挖掘，他考虑着应该把它挖成什么样子，这时，他的手指握住了某个坚实的东西——一个圆滚滚的固体——一个不太规则的东西被渐渐挖出来，他把它放到地面上。一抹浅绿在一层细沙被擦去后显露出来，原来是块浑浊的玻璃，它很不透明，棱角已经被海水彻底磨掉，失去了原来的形状，你难以辨别它之前到底是个玻璃杯、玻璃瓶还是一块窗玻璃。反正它只是一块玻璃，你也可以把它当成一块宝石。你只要在它上面穿条绳子，再给它镶个边儿，它就能变成一条项链上的一颗宝石了。你也可以当它是指针上的一抹绿光。没准它还真是一块宝石呢，是某位黑公主戴过的东西，她将手指伸进水中，坐在船的尾部，在划桨的奴隶们的歌声中，穿过这片海湾；抑或是某个伊丽莎白时代沉落海底的珠宝箱的橡木箍断开了，然后翻滚着，翻滚着，里面的绿宝石就被冲到了海岸上。约翰把它放在手心，来回滚动，拿它对着阳光看，将它对着他的朋友看，以使这个不规则的小玩意儿把他朋友的身体遮住，并拉长他的右臂；当它对着天空看时，那抹绿色变得更浅了一些；当它对着身体时，颜色又会略微变深。它使他高兴，亦使他疑惑。和这片模糊的海洋和朦胧的海滨比起来，它是一个更加坚硬，更加集中，更加确切的物体。

他的思绪被一阵深远、短促的叹气声打断了，然后他意识到，是他的朋友查尔斯要么已经把身边所有的石头片儿都扔光了，要么就是他觉得扔石头赚不了什么便宜。两人开始吃三明治，吃完以后抖抖身子站起来，约翰一言不发，仍拿着那块玻璃细细端详，查尔斯也看着它。他一眼就看出它不是扁的。他把烟斗填满，带着一股排除愚蠢思想的力量，他说：

“话又说回来——”

他没有看见，或者看见了，只是没有注意到：约翰端详了一会儿玻璃，在犹豫的那一刻把玻璃偷偷放进了衣兜里。那种冲动，或许也致使一个孩子在一条鹅卵石铺就的路上捡起一块鹅卵石，并向它许诺要把它放在儿童室的壁炉架上，给予它永恒的安全和温暖，且当意识到这种举动所蕴含的仁爱和力量后感到无比喜悦，并始终相信，当这块石头看到自己是被从千千万万枚石头中选出，得以享受这种福气，避免在大路上忍受寒冷和潮湿度过一辈子时，它一定也会满心欢喜。“或许一不小心，我就同那成千上万的石头同一命运了，不过这次被选中的是我，是我，我！”

约翰心里的想法是不是这样，无人知道，不过这块玻璃的确被放在了壁炉架上，它不仅成为了一块上好的镇纸，在它颇有分量的身体下，压着一些信件和账单，还成为了这个年轻人的目光从书本上离开后，一个自然而然的驻足点。一边盯着这个东西，一边想着别的事情，心神恍惚间，这件东西就与心中想着的事情紧紧纠缠在了一起。它会失去本来的形态，在我们并不刻意期盼却在脑海里拥有了另一个理想的形状时，它就会重新组合自己，让自己稍有不同。约翰发现，他去外面散步的时候，被古玩店的橱窗所吸引，只是因为看到了某些让他能联想起那块玻璃的东西。任何东西，只要它是一种物体，看起来圆润，或许自身形体内还镶嵌着一道残留的光焰，任何东西——比如琥珀、岩石、大理石、瓷器——甚至一个史前遗留至今的滑溜溜的鸟蛋，他都会这么做。渐渐地，他的关注点聚焦到了地面，尤其是每家每户扔垃圾的荒地周围，因为在那种地方，这种物体出现的频率更高——它们只是被扔掉了，一无是处，没有形态，废物一个。短短几个月，在壁炉架上又多了四五个他收集来的东西。它们是有用的，因为一个正在竞选议员，即将平步青云、一飞冲天的人有许多文件需要摆放整齐——比如施政宣言、演讲稿、号召捐赠的稿件、宴会请帖等等。

有一天，他准备乘坐火车去给选民们做演讲，刚从圣殿律师学院的房间里走出来，就在法政机关大楼下的一片狭长的草丛带里发现了一个东西，那个东西躺在地上，若隐若现，在他眼里却特别显眼。只有把手杖探到栅栏里面，他才能用手杖的尖端碰到它。但他看得出，它是一块形状极其独特的碎瓷片，有点像海星，或许它本来就是那样，也或许是某个物件儿意外摔成了那样，有了五个不规则却又十分精准的尖角。它的主体颜色是蓝色的，不过在蓝色主体上点缀着一些绿色的碎点儿和条纹儿，还有一些红色的线条，显得格外明艳漂亮。约翰努力往前伸他的手杖，誓要得到它，可是那个东西却一个劲地后退。他只好回屋找了一根长棍，突发奇想在上面套了一个铁丝圈儿，用它施展技巧，最终一点点地把那个碎瓷片儿拨弄到了手能够得着的地方。他把它攥在手里的那一刻，不禁发出了一声胜利的欢呼，几乎是同时，钟声敲响了。失约已成定局。那场会议将在没有他的情况下按时举行。但这枚模样奇特的碎瓷片究竟是怎么形成的呢？海星形是偶然摔成的，细看之下就能确定。这太奇怪了，无疑，世上再难找出第二枚这种形状的碎片来。它被放在壁炉架上，与从海滩挖出来的那块玻璃疙瘩遥相对应，这个稀奇古怪的东西像一个小丑，仿佛是一个来自另一个世界的生物。它又像一颗在天空中旋转，闪烁不定的星星。与那块沉默深邃的玻璃疙瘩相比，这块碎瓷片要活泼鲜明得多，两者的差异使他着迷，令他好奇，也让他迷惘，他不禁自问：这两件东西怎么可能同时存在于一个世界，现在居然还在同一个房间里的同一块狭窄的大理石上面放着。这是一个没有答案的问题。

于是，他开始频繁出没于那些发现碎瓷片几率较高的地方，比如铁轨周围的荒地里，伦敦周边的工地里，或者拆除后的旧房屋的遗址上。但是瓷器从高处扔下来的事件显然不可多得，这是一种极其罕见的人类行为。除非你能同时遇上一栋高楼大厦，和一个脾气异常暴躁，思想偏激，做事冲动的女人，她毫不理会下面是否有人，直愣愣地就把瓶瓶罐罐从窗户里扔下来。你可以找到许多碎瓷片，摔碎的原因十之八九都只是一些琐碎的家庭活动，根本没有目的性，也没有什么奇特的地方。不过，当他深入思考这个问题时，他常常为仅在伦敦就发现了如此数量的奇形怪状的东西而感到惊诧，那些形形色色的设计与材质给予他无限惊奇，让他遐思万千。遇上最精致的样品，他就会把它们带回家，放在壁炉架上，不过，随着需要镇纸压住的文件越来越少，它们放在那里的功用更多的就是装饰、点缀。

最终，他落选了。或许是因为他对自己的工作职责过于懈怠、敷衍，也或许是因为他的选民们前来造访时，他的壁炉架没有给他们留下良好的印象。总之，无论如何，他失去了代表他们的资格。查尔斯是他的朋友，因为放心不下这件事而过来安慰他，可是在这位朋友眼里的灾难，似乎根本就没有对他产生一丝的打击。查尔斯只能认为，他的朋友只是失去了对于这件事的整体认知能力，因为这件事对他造成的打击太严重了。

事实上，这一天约翰去了巴纳斯工地，他在一片荆豆丛里发现了一个铁块，这是一个与那块玻璃的形状非常相似的铁块，它特别坚硬，样子像一个圆球，但却冰冷，沉重，乌黑，且具有金属特性，根本不是地球上的东西，他或许来自某颗濒临毁灭的星球，或者它也可能是某颗卫星的残体。它坠在他的口袋里，怪沉的，然后壁炉架承担了它的体重。这个散放着幽冷气息的“陨铁”摆在了那枚玻璃疙瘩和海星状碎瓷片所在的台子上。

这些东西映入这个年轻人的眼帘时，他被自己那种远不满足于这些东西的占有欲折磨着。于是他的寻觅变得更加投入，更加坚决了。他坚定地认为，总有一天他会从某个垃圾堆里找到回报，因此即便屡屡遭受愚弄，承受着疲累和失望，他也依旧雄心不减，决不放弃这种追求。他带着一根长棍，在上面装了一个口袋和一只灵活多变的钩子，将整个土层翻遍；灌木丛也成了他搜寻的地方，无论它们纠缠得有多么厉害；他也期望能在墙壁间的巷弄和空地上找到这种被遗弃的玩意儿。随着他失望的次数越来越多，他的品位和标准也越来越高，但是那些奇形怪状的碎瓷片和玻璃疙瘩就像是他的一线曙光一样，诱惑着他不断地寻觅下去。直到多年过去，他失去了他的前程——即他的政治前程，也失去了他的青春，再也没有人来拜访他。他沉默寡言，关于自己的理想和追求从来不会认真地讲给别人听。人们不愿请他吃饭，也不会给予他理解——从他们的言谈和行为上就可以看出。

查尔斯把壁炉架上的石头拿起又放下，这个动作重复了十几次，他正在大肆评论政府的举措，显然一次都没有注意到石头的存在。而他，只是懒洋洋地陷在椅子里，看着他。

“这究竟是怎么一回事，约翰？”查尔斯忽然转过身来，盯着他，“你怎么会突然就放弃了呢？”

“我现在还没放弃。”约翰回答。

“可你现在一点机会都没有了。”查尔斯狂躁地说。

“我并不这样认为。”约翰满怀信心地说。查尔斯盯着他，一点也不觉得踏实。他有着一肚子的疑惑，他甚至生出一种怪异的感觉来——他们根本说不到一块儿去。为了缓解这种糟糕的沮丧感，他让自己四下扫视着，可是看到这个乱糟糟的房间后，他觉得更加心灰意冷了。那些破石头是什么玩意儿？还有挂在墙上的那只旧旅行包，又是什么东西？他看向约翰，然后他陷入了惶恐之中，约翰居然表现出了一脸悠远的专注。再想让他走上演讲台已经是不可能的事了，他看明白了这一点。

“好漂亮的石头啊！”他尽量挤出满脸的欢喜说道，紧接着便说他还有另一个约会，自此他永远地离开了约翰。





公爵夫人与珠宝商


奥利夫·培根住在这幢房子的顶层，从这里他可以俯瞰格林公园。他拥有一整套公寓；几把皮面椅子以一种恰到好处的角度凸现出来，几张锦套沙发将阳台填满。三个长方形窗户，素白的网格搭配着花缎，相得益彰。红木橱柜里考虑周到地装满了适口的白兰地、威士忌以及各种烈酒。从中间的窗户向下望去，他就能看到皮卡迪利窄巷里停满了时尚轿车，锃光瓦亮的车顶一览无余。这个地段位处中心，再难想象还有哪儿比它更优越了。清晨八点的时候，他将享用男仆用托盘端来的早餐：男仆通常会将他在清晨所穿的那件红色晨衣摊开，他总是用自己尖锐的长指甲挑开那些信封，然后从中抽出白色请柬。这些厚厚的请柬，上面有突出的图纹，无非是一些公爵、伯爵或子爵夫人或者其他贵妇名媛们送来的。他洗漱完毕后，会先吃点烤面包，然后就会坐在煤电燃烧发出的亮光下看报。

“奥利夫，你看，”他常常自言自语，“你的生活是从这条脏乱不堪的小巷子里开始的，你——”他低头去看自己的腿，穿着完美的裤子显得线条十分生动；再看看靴子，看看靴套。它们全都线条优美，光鲜亮丽，皆是萨威尔大街[1]最好的工匠用最好的布料裁剪出来的。可是每当他卸下这套装扮，他就又变回了游荡在黑巷里一个穷鬼。他曾一度想，他的最高理想——就是能偷几条狗，把它们卖给白教堂区的那些时尚的女人。有一次他真的成功了。“哦！奥利夫呀，”他的母亲声泪俱下地说，“奥利夫呀！你什么时候才能长大呀，我的儿子？”……这之后他在柜台工作过，还倒卖过廉价的手表，揣着个钱包跑到阿姆斯特丹……想到这些，他忽然笑了起来——成年的奥利夫回忆起年少时的奥利夫。是啊，那次的确干得很漂亮，三颗钻石，以及通过那些绿宝石吃的回扣。他还进过哈顿花园的一家商店，待在商店后面的密室里。在那间房子，摆放着保险柜、天平、厚厚的放大镜。而后……而后……他又开始大笑。记得那是一个晚上，空气特别闷热，许多的珠宝商都聚集在那里，议论着价格、金矿、钻石、南非来的报导。他挤在人群中的时候，有一个人用手指指了指鼻子，发出一声轻哼。不过是轻轻地撞了下肩膀，一根手指头戳了戳他的鼻子，不过是在一个闷热的晚上，从哈顿花园的珠宝商堆里传来的一声哼哼罢了——啊，已经过了这么多年了！但奥利夫依然感觉它咕噜噜地顺着脊梁往下直窜。那一碰，一哼，就像在说：“嘿，快瞧啊，年轻的珠宝商奥利夫，他要走了！”他那会儿的确还年轻，最初只有一辆两个轮子的马车，后来有了一辆汽车，穿衣打扮越来越讲求档次；最初的时候，看戏只是上花楼，后来就必须是正厅里靠在前排的座位；他在里士满[2]买了一栋近水别墅，在格子棚架上养着红玫瑰；法国小姐每天清晨都会摘一朵玫瑰插在他的扣眼里。

“哈——”奥利夫·培根站了起来，伸了伸腿，“哈——”

壁炉上方有一幅老妇人的画像，他站在画像下高举双手，说：“我说过的都做到了，我赌赢了！”他双掌合在一起，像是在向她祷告。他说的是真的，他成了英国最富有的珠宝商，可他那跟大象鼻子一样的，容易弯曲的长鼻子，鼻孔莫名其妙地颤动了一下（不光是鼻孔，好像整个鼻子都在颤动），像是在说他还不满足；他闻到了还有什么东西在他前面的地下。你试想一下，有一头体型巨大的肥猪在这片盛产块菌[3]的牧场上拱来拱去，一块块块菌被它拱出来，有一块更大更黑的块菌就在它前面的地下，也被它闻到了。奥利夫的前面就有一块更大更黑的块菌，就在梅菲尔这块富饶的土地上。

他规整了一下领带上的珍珠，把那件时髦的蓝色大衣套在身上，然后拿起黄手套和手杖，左摇右晃地下了楼。他那尖尖的长鼻子，一边吸气，一边叹气，行走在皮卡迪利大街上。虽然这一把他赌赢了，可是他仍旧不满足，他仍旧没有感觉到丝毫快乐，就好像还有什么隐藏着的东西在等着他去寻找。

他晃晃悠悠地走在路上，就好像动物园里行走在柏油小道上的骆驼，一摇一晃的。而那些杂货商们以及他们的妻子们，就挤在小道的两旁，吃着从纸袋里掏出来的东西，然后把银锡箔揉成一团随手丢在路上。骆驼的眼睛里，是一片蓝盈盈的湖水，还有湖畔的一整排棕榈树。骆驼对自己的命运极度不满。骆驼对杂货商们不屑一顾。这位珠宝商——全世界最富有的珠宝商，左摇右摆地从皮卡迪利大街走过去，他戴着手套，拄着手杖，那身衣着装扮无可挑剔，可是他依然不满足。他走进邦德街[4]附近的那家昏暗的小店，这家小店在法国、德国、奥地利、意大利乃至全美洲都十分出名。

他一句话也不说，就像往常那样，挺胸抬头，穿过商店。马歇尔和斯宾塞两个老伙计，赫蒙特和维克斯两个小伙计，这四个伙计全都直挺挺地站着，用艳羡的目光注视着他。他的一根藏在琥珀色手套里的手指动了一下，以此表示他跟他们打过招呼了。然后他走进私室，关上门。

他把窗户的格子窗帘拉开，霎时间，邦德街的喧嚣声，以及远处车辆的嘈杂声一下子涌了进来。商店后面的反光镜让光线拐了个弯，向上射去，一棵树摇晃着它的六片绿叶，因为正值六月。现在，再没有人在他的扣眼里插一朵玫瑰花了，因为那名法国小姐已经嫁给了当地的啤酒商派特先生。

“哈——”他半叹气，半喷鼻息，“哈——”

他在墙上的一根弹簧上按了下，嵌板缓缓地滑到一旁，露出后面的五个，不，是六个保险柜，全部都是用抛光钢制作的。他用一把钥匙拧了下，打开了一个保险柜，接着又打开了一个。每一个里面都垫着一层暗红色的天鹅绒垫层。每一个保险柜里都放着珠宝首饰——项链，头饰，公爵的头冠，手镯，戒指，放在玻璃罩里的零散的宝石，珍珠，钻石，红宝石，绿宝石，每一颗都占据着一席之地，映射出璀璨的冷光，它们把光线浓缩起来，打算永远地燃烧下去。

“眼泪啊！”奥利夫看向珍珠，说道。

“心血啊！”然后他又看向红宝石，说道。

“炸药！”他继续说，手指拨弄钻石发出唰啦啦的响声，那光彩显得更加璀璨了。

“炸药足够把梅菲尔炸飞了——飞了，飞了，飞了！”他仰起头，像是马儿嘶鸣一样。

桌上的电话响了起来，发出细声细气的嗡嗡声，好似迎合奉承一般。他把保险柜关上。

“十分钟以内，”他说，“不会提前。”说完他坐在办公桌前，盯着袖口上的那枚雕刻着罗马帝王头像的链扣。他又把自己的那套装束换下来，再一次变回了在那条街巷里弹玻璃球的小男孩，他们每个星期天都会在那条巷子里倒卖偷来的狗。他变成了那个有着樱桃般红润嘴唇的古灵精怪似的小男孩。他把手指伸进那些穿成串的牛肚中间，他把牛肚放入煎锅里。他在人群里躲躲藏藏，他消瘦而敏捷，一双眼睛像被舔舐过的宝石一样。可现在——现在时钟的指针一刻不停地走着，一，二，三，四……百代伯爵的金枝玉叶莱博恩公爵夫人正在等他抽出时间来接见自己。她需要等个十来分钟，她得等到他抽出时间并且愿意见她的时候她才能见到他，所以她现在正坐在柜台前的一把椅子上。那只时钟套在一个绿色的套子里，指针一刻不停地走着，他看着它，每走一步它都要响一下，每响一下就好像是这只钟给他送来——肥鹅肝酱，一杯香槟，一杯上等的白兰地，一支价值一几尼的雪茄。时钟用十分钟时间，把这些东西全都送到了他的面前，就在桌子上摆着。走廊那里传来微不可闻的动静，响起轻轻的脚步声，然后门开了，赫蒙特先生贴着墙站好，通报道：“公爵夫人到了。”

他身子贴在墙上，恭候在那里。

奥利夫能听见公爵夫人从走廊走过来时衣裙带出的微弱声音，他站起来，她的身影已经映入眼帘，所有公爵与公爵夫人的香味、名望、傲慢、阔绰、骄傲、气质都化成一个巨浪，从门外汹汹涌涌扑进来，填满了整间屋子。她坐下来时，巨浪就破碎了，她也碎了，往四下里扩散，并迸溅起来，溅到大珠宝商奥利夫·培根的身上，那绚烂缤纷的绿色、红色、紫色将他笼罩。他的身上蒙上了浓郁的香味，缤纷的色彩，还有从丝绸上散出的、从羽毛上飞出的、从指端射出的各种各样的光辉。她的个头很高，体态也极为丰腴，一身衣着都是粉色塔夫绢[5]料子做成的。她的年龄已经过了最灿烂的季节，从前她是一把扶摇在荷叶边的遮阳伞，而今伞已折起；从前她是一只开屏的孔雀，而今雀屏已收敛。如今，她收敛起自己的一切，深陷在皮质的扶手椅里面。

“早上好，培根先生。”她说着，从那只白色手套里抽出自己的手，奥利夫躬身致礼，握了握她的手。这两只手刚触碰在一起，就又一次建立起两个人的联系。他们亦敌亦友，一个是主人，一个是主妇，相互欺瞒，相互利用，惧怕着彼此，他们待在这间不大的屋子里，外面阳光明媚，大街上无比喧闹，有六片叶子挂在那棵树上，身后立着几个保险柜，每当他们的手握在一起时，他们都会有这样的感觉。

“公爵夫人，不知今天有什么可以为您效劳呢？”奥利夫开口说道，他的表现尽显温柔。

公爵夫人不说话，只是叹了口气，她打算说些掏心窝子的话了。她从手提包里掏出一个长长的模样像是一只瘦小的黄毛雪貂似的软皮口袋，雪貂的肚子上有一条缝儿，她就从这条缝里一连挤出十颗珍珠来。一颗，两颗，三颗，四颗——这些如同某种天上鸟儿的蛋一样的珍珠从雪貂肚子上的那条缝儿里滚落出来。

“亲爱的培根先生，我只剩下这些了。”她带着悲戚的语调说道。五颗，六颗，七颗——珍珠滚落出来，从那巨山的斜坡上滚下，落入她两膝之间那条狭窄的山谷里——八颗，九颗，十颗。一共十颗珍珠，它们正躺在塔夫绢的桃红色光辉中。

“从阿普尔比教堂的圣衣腰带上摘下来的，”她哀伤地说道，“最后的了……我把最后的这些全都带来了。”

奥利夫伸手拈起一颗，用拇指和食指夹着它，莹润，浑圆，是真是假呢？她是不是又在说谎？她敢吗？

她竖起一根圆滚滚的手指放在自己唇上，压低声音说道：“要是让公爵先生知道了这件事，那就全完……”

她是不是又在赌运气？

“混蛋！骗子！”她咬牙说道。

颧骨受伤的那个人？是个混蛋。据他所知，公爵挺得像根烧火棍一样，蓄着络腮胡子；要是他知道了，准会跟她撇清关系，然后把她关起来，奥利夫想，接着向身后的保险柜瞄了一眼。

“我全都是为了她们。”她期期艾艾地说，“戴安娜、达芙妮和阿拉明塔。”

他认识戴安娜、达芙妮和阿拉明塔，她们是她的女儿，他很仰慕她们，不过只爱戴安娜一个人。

“我所有的秘密都被你知道了。”她向他暗送秋波。她的脸上滚下泪珠，钻石一般的泪珠，在她那樱花一样的脸颊上滑落，沾着泪槽里的脂粉，滑落。

“老朋友，”她嘟囔着，“我的老朋友啊！”

“老朋友，”他重复道，“老朋友。”就好像在舔舐着这几个字。

“你打算卖多少钱？”他试探着问。

她用一只手盖住珍珠。

“两万！”她压低声音说。

但他手里捏着的这颗，究竟是真是假呢？阿普尔比圣衣腰带——她不是已经卖掉了吗？他需要按铃把斯宾塞和赫蒙特叫来。“我要先拿去验一验。”他说，并伸手按铃。

“明天请你一定要去一趟我家，好吗？”她打断了他的计划，她用恳求的语气说，“有首相，有王室……”她又补充道，“……还有戴安娜。”

奥利夫将手从铃上拿开。

他的视线越过她的头顶，投注到邦德街那一栋栋房子的后墙上。他看的并不是邦德街的建筑，而是那条荡起阵阵涟漪的河。他看见鳟鱼跃出水面，鲑鱼在河水里嬉戏；他看到了首相，以及身着白色马甲的自己。还看到了戴安娜。他低下头，瞅了瞅手里的珍珠，怎么样才能判断它的真伪呢？用戴安娜的目光吗？还是用那条河泛出来的水光？这时候，公爵夫人也一眨不眨地盯着他看。

“两万！”她期期艾艾地说，“我以自己的声誉来担保！”

戴安娜母亲的声誉！他把支票簿拽了过来，然后拿出了钢笔。

“两……”他刚写了一个字便顿笔。画里老夫人的眼睛正盯着他——那老夫人的，也就是他母亲的眼睛。

“奥利夫，”她在向他示警，“不要犯糊涂，别做糊涂事！”

“奥利夫！”公爵夫人用恳求的语调说，她用的是“奥利夫”，不是“培根先生”了，“这个长长的周末你会过来吧？”

和戴安娜在树林里单独相处！和戴安娜在树林里骑马！

他写上“万”！然后签上自己的名字。

“拿去。”他说。

她离开椅子，站了起来。如阳伞般的荷叶霎时张开，如一只开屏的孔雀，又开始闪动波光了，阿金库尔[6]又亮出刀剑了。斯宾塞、马歇尔、维克斯和赫蒙特，这两对老少，四个伙计，又贴在了柜台后面，齐刷刷地目送着他领着她穿过店面走到门口，目光不无艳羡。他走过他们时晃了晃黄手套。她用两只手紧紧攥着她的名誉，这张支票上有他的签名，价值两万英镑。

“这些珍珠是真的吗？”奥利夫问道，他关上门。那十颗珍珠就摆放在他办公桌上的一张吸墨纸上。他走到窗户前，对着阳光，用放大镜照射这些珍珠……原来这就是他从土里拱出来的块菌。从核儿里就烂了，烂透了！

“妈妈，请您原谅我吧！”他举起一只手，像是在祈求画里的老夫人原谅他。他又变回那条巷子里的小男孩儿了，每到礼拜天人们就会在那里倒卖偷来的狗。

“为了，”他双掌合在一起，喃喃说道，“这个长长的周末！”

遗　物


“茜茜·米勒留念。”在妻子的客厅里，基尔伯德·克兰顿捡起小桌上的一枚珍珠胸针，它就混在那些散乱摆放的戒指和胸针里，他读着上面的铭文：“茜茜·米勒留念，顺附爱心一片。”

真是安吉拉一贯的作风，连她的秘书茜茜·米勒都没有落下。不过基尔伯德·克兰顿又一想，这很奇怪，她的每一个朋友都得到了她的一件赠礼，难道她预感到自己即将离开这个世界，所以才把一切都安排得这么妥当吗？可是六个星期前那天早晨，当她走出家门的时候，身体非常健康。当她在皮卡迪利[1]刚刚踏出人行道时，一辆汽车夺走了她的生命。

他正等候着茜茜·米勒，他邀请了她过来。他觉得他应该把这件表达关爱的纪念品送到她的手中，毕竟她跟他们共事了这么多年。他坐在那里一边等待，一边继续想着心事，说起来真奇怪，安吉拉把所有事情都安排得滴水不漏，为每一个朋友都留下了一份代表着关爱的小礼物作为纪念。不管是戒指、项链，还是小盒子上（她对小盒子相当偏爱）都铭刻着某个人的名字。任何一件小礼物都能引起他曾经的回忆。比方说，有一件小玩意儿是他送给她的；还有另一件，一个眼睛部位镶嵌着红宝石的搪瓷海豚，是她在威尼斯的某条偏僻的街巷里购买的，当时她一下就喜欢上了它，到现在他还记得她那声欣喜的惊呼呢。可是，她留给他的，仅仅是日记，她写的日记，除此之外再没有其他特别的东西了。那是十五个绿色封皮的小本子，整整齐齐地排列在他身后的她的书桌上。她每天都写日记，从他们结婚那天开始就没有断过。他们为数不多的几次——他并不称它们为争吵，顶多算是口角——就与这些日记有关。他每次回家看到她写日记，她就会用双手捂住，要么就是把日记本合上。他依稀又听到她的话音：“不行，不行，就是不行，等我哪天不在这个世界了，你再——”现在，它成了她的遗物，她就这样把她的日记留给了他。他们在一起生活的时候，所有东西都是共享的，除了那些日记。他曾经一厢情愿地以为，她会比他活得更长久。也许她只要稍微停顿那么片刻，想一想自己正在干什么，她现在就依然能活生生地站在他的面前。可是撞了她的司机在接受审讯的时候说，她走出人行道的那一秒根本没有给他刹车的机会，她迈出的那一步是那么的突兀……门厅里传来说话声，他的思绪被拽回了现实。

“米勒小姐来了，先生。”女用说。

她走了进来。以前他们俩从来没有单独见过面，她更没有在他面前流过泪。可是现在她哭得很伤心。这也难怪，安吉拉不仅仅是她的上司，更是她的朋友。他搬过来一把椅子，请她坐下。他想，她并不比与她同类型的其他女人出色多少。像茜茜·米勒这样穿着一身黑色制服，手里提着公文包，看起来毫无活力的小女人，实在数不胜数。可是善于发现别人之美的安吉拉，却能在茜茜·米勒身上发现一系列优秀品质，譬如，她踏实可靠，惜言如金，做事稳重谨慎，人们都乐意对她吐露心声，诸如此类的等等。

刚开始，米勒小姐泣不成声，只是坐在那里不停地用手帕擦眼泪。过后，她卯足了劲似的开口：“请原谅我，克兰顿先生。”

他随口寒暄了几句。这是人之常情，他心里明白。他能够猜到，妻子于她而言意味着什么。

她四下里扫视着，说道：“在这儿工作的时间里，我感到特别开心。”最后她的目光定在了他身后的写字桌上。那曾是她们工作的地方——她和安吉拉。作为一名政府要员的妻子，她尽心竭力地履行着自己所肩负的责任，她是他事业上的贤内助。每次他都能看到她与茜茜坐在那张桌子前——茜茜遵照她的口述，在打字机上敲打信函。显然米勒小姐也回想起了这些过往。现在他只是要把妻子遗赠给她的胸针交给她，这是他必须做的也是唯一能做的了。只是，这件礼物是不是分量有点太轻了？就算给她一些钱，或者把那台打字机送给她，都要显得更隆重一些。可是那件铭刻着“茜茜·米勒留念，顺附爱心一片”的胸针就在这儿。他把胸针递给她，顺便简短地演讲了一番刚刚准备好的说辞。他说，他知道她会珍爱这件礼物，这是他妻子生前经常佩戴的一件饰品……她接过胸针后也回应了一篇如同事先准备好的演说词，说它将是她永远珍爱的宝物……她身上穿着一套黑色衣裙，应该是一套该行业统一的职业装，样式又短又瘦。他想，她应该换上别的什么衣服，免得戴上这枚珍珠胸针后显得那么不搭调。不过他突然反应过来，她穿的这身衣服是丧服，没错！她也刚刚遭遇了不幸，在比安吉拉早一两个星期的时候，她的一个至亲的哥哥死了。安吉拉向他提到过。好像是发生了什么意外吧，他记不大清了。那时候安吉拉心情特别糟糕，她实在太关心别人了。茜茜·米勒站了起来，她把手套戴到手上，她显然觉得自己不应该过来叨扰主人。可是无论如何也要先谈谈她的未来打算才能让她走啊。她是怎么打算的？有没有哪些方面他能帮扶一把呢？

她望着那张桌子，从前，她就在那里打字，现在桌子上面放着那些日记本。她沉浸在对安吉拉的思念里，并没有马上回答他关于给予帮助的建议。他想，她大概是没有领会自己的意思，于是又说了一遍：“米勒小姐，你将来怎么打算的？”

“打算？哦，我没什么打算，克兰顿先生。”她回答道，“您没必要为我操心。”

他把她的意思领会为：她并不需要他的资助。他意识到，这种建议还是用书面的方式提出比较好。当她起身告辞，两人握手的时候，他所能做的仅仅是说一句：“请记住，米勒小姐，要是有任何我能够帮得上忙的地方，请尽管开口……”他打开门，她好像忽然想起了什么，停在了门口。

“克兰顿先生。”她说，并第一次直视他的眼睛，而他也第一次被她那双清澈而富有同情心的眼睛所打动。她继续说道：“看在您夫人的分上，不管什么时候，只要您有什么需要我出力的地方，我一定义不容辞……”

话一说完，她就走了。这让他感到特别意外，她说的话，她说话时的神情，就像是她认定他会需要她的帮忙，或者反过来说她希望他有用得着她的地方。他走回椅子跟前，一个荒谬的、奇怪的想法忽然冒了出来。这些年里他其实很少关注她，她会不会像小说里写的那样，不知不觉地对他产生了那种情愫呢？他从镜子前面走过去，捕捉到自己的形象，虽然他已经年过五十，但他不得不承认，正如镜子中所呈现出的那般，他仍旧是一个相貌出众的男人。

“可怜的茜茜·米勒！”他忽然忍俊不禁，说道。他好想以这个话题为引子，来跟妻子开个玩笑啊！如同出于一种本能，他的注意力转向了她的日记。随手翻开了一页，上面写道：“基尔伯德看起来一副春风得意的样子……”简直就像是对他的问题给予了回答一样，她似乎是说，在女人们眼里，你魅力不凡。茜茜·米勒自然也是如此感觉。他继续往下读。“能做他的妻子，是我的骄傲！”当然，他也一直为能做她的丈夫而骄傲。他们出去吃饭的时候，他常常会隔着餐桌一个劲地打量她，并告诉自己：“这里的女人当中，她是最可爱的！”他继续读日记。那年他第一次竞选议员，两人在他的选区里巡回演讲。“基尔伯德坐下来，掌声如潮水般响起。全体人员起立，高声歌唱：‘因为他是最好的伙伴。’我被深深感染。”他也记得当时的场面。他们俩就肩并肩在演讲台上坐着，当时她望向他，他与她的目光撞上，发现她眼眶湿润。他翻动着日记。后来他们去了威尼斯。他回想起了当选后的那次愉快假日。“在弗罗里安，我们吃着冰淇淋。”他笑了，她依然像个孩子，喜欢吃冰淇淋。“基尔伯德把威尼斯的历史讲给我听，简直不能再有趣了。他还给我讲那些总督……”她用小学生的字体将这些一一记录了下来。安吉拉的求知欲特别旺盛，这也是他和安吉拉一起出去旅行的一大乐趣。她总是说，她什么都不懂，就好像这也是她的一项魅力似的。接着——他翻开下一本日记——他们回到了伦敦。“我迫不及待想留下一个好印象。我穿上了结婚礼服。”他仿佛又看到了她坐在他的上司老爱德华爵士的身旁，那个老家伙为她的绝世风华所倾倒。他赶紧接着往下读，那些场景便因为她这些零零碎碎的记叙而完整起来，饱满起来。“吃饭地点是下议院……在拉弗格拉夫的晚宴上，拉弗格拉夫夫人问我有没有做好心理准备，担起身为基尔伯德妻子的责任。”后来，随着时间的流逝——他把越来越多的精力和时间都投入到工作中。她独守空房的日子越来越多……她最大的遗憾就是，他们没能生养一个孩子。有一篇日记写道：“我多么希望，基尔伯德能有一个儿子。”可是，现在想起来真够奇怪的，这种情况并没有让他觉得有多少遗憾。他一直都觉得自己的生活非常精彩，非常充实。那年，他还只是在政府供职的一个小官，那真是一个芝麻大的小官，不过她却这样评论：“我现在更加坚信了，他将来肯定能成为首相！”如果情况略微发生些改变，倒也不是没有可能，只是……他停顿了片刻，思考着这个可能性。他想，政治就如一场豪赌，虽然现在已年过半百，但是这并不意味着角逐即将结束。他迅速地浏览着，又看了几页，这几页记录的都是一些日常琐事。正是这些微不足道的小快乐组成了她的生活。

他又拿起一本日记，随手翻开一页。“我真是个胆小鬼！我又失去了一次机会。不过他的公务那么繁忙，我不应该那么自私，拿自己的小事情去烦扰他。况且，今晚我们能够单独在一起，已经够难得了。”这话是什么意思呢？哦，原来是指她在东区的工作，日记下面就有解释。“后来我鼓足勇气，向基尔伯德说了这件事，他并没有反对。他总是这么通情达理。”那场对话他现在回忆起来了。她对他说，她希望有一份自己的工作，不想再这么游手好闲，一无是处。她想做点能够帮助别人的事情——她当时就坐在那把椅子上，说这件事儿的时候满脸通红。他还记得他当时油嘴滑舌地调侃了她几句。这么多事了她还觉得无所事事吗？又要照顾丈夫，还要打理家中的大小事务。不过，他是不会反对的，只要这件事能让她开心就好，管它是什么事，哪个地区，哪个委员会，唯一重要的就是，她必须答应不能把自己累出毛病来。记得好像每个礼拜三她都会去一趟白教堂区。那会儿他非常不喜欢她那身必须在那种场合下穿的衣服。不过她似乎干得特别认真。她的日记中记录了许多这样的事情：“探望琼斯夫人……她丈夫在事故中失去了一只手臂，她自己养着十个孩子……我尽全力帮助莉莉找了一份工作。”他继续往下看。接下来他的名字出现的次数并没有那么密集了，所以他的兴趣也减弱了，有几篇他甚至都看不大懂。“同B.M.激烈争论了一番，话题是关于社会主义。”这个B.M.是谁？他想通过这两个首字母把名字补全，可是办不到。他猜测，或许是她在某个委员会上遇到的某个女人吧。“有一次B.M.狠狠地抨击上层社会阶级……散会以后我同B.M.一道回家，路上我试图说服他，可是他的心胸实在太狭隘了。”原来B.M.是个男人，十有八九又是那些自命不凡的知识分子中的一员。就跟安吉拉说的一模一样，这类人心胸狭窄，言语偏激。她还邀请过他来做客。“B.M.前来用餐，他同米妮握了握手！”他想象出的情景居然被这个惊叹号扭曲了一下。B.M.跟米妮握了握手，他好像因为客厅里有女用而感到拘谨。基尔伯德对这种人并不陌生，这是一种被驯化了的工人，经常出没于上流社会妇女们的客厅里，然后借机鼓吹自己的观点。别管B.M.是什么人，反正他对这类人一点好感也没有。接下来又是他。“同B.M.一起参观伦敦塔……他说我们被这个虚幻乐园给蒙蔽了……他说即将掀起一场革命。”基尔伯德似乎都听到了他在那里大放厥词，这正是B.M.这种人的口头禅，而且他还能看清楚他那副嘴脸：个头跟侏儒似的，满脸乱蓬蓬的胡须，身上总是穿一套花呢西服，系一条红领带，一辈子都没做过一件像样的事。以安吉拉的眼光，肯定能一眼就看透他。继续往下读。“B.M.说了许多特别难听的话，他说的是……”那个名字被小心翼翼地划掉了。“我告诉他，我不想听他诽谤……”又是一个被划掉了的名字。难道是他自己的名字吗？每次安吉拉都会在他进来时捂住她的日记，原因是在这里吗？他本来就对B.M.异常反感，这个想法无疑起到了催化作用。他居然敢在这间屋子里数落他的不是，真是太没教养了！但是，安吉拉为什么从来也没有跟他提过这件事啊？她并没有隐瞒事情的习惯，一向都非常坦诚，简直堪称典范呀。他翻阅着这本日记，把所有与B.M.有关联的话都找出来。“B.M.给我讲了他的童年，他说自己的母亲是个清洁工……知道这个情况后，我感觉现在过的这种生活太奢华了，都不忍心再继续过下去了……一顶帽子就要三个几尼[2]！”这问题太过复杂，她怎么可能想明白呢？如果她能把问题说出来，跟他一起探讨，那该多好啊！那样的话，她也就用不着用这些问题伤她的小脑瓜了。《卡尔·马克思之未来革命》，他居然还借给她书看。不断地出现B.M.，B.M.，B.M.……可为什么从头到尾也没有提过全名呢？用首字母来代替，意味着关系亲密，比较随意，这可不是安吉拉一直以来的个性。她会不会当面也是直接称呼他为B.M.呢？他继续翻阅。“让人意外的是，吃完晚饭后，B.M.来了，幸好这时家里只有我一个人。”那是一年前发生的事。“幸好”——她为什么要用“幸好”呢？——“家里只有我一个人。”那一天，他在哪儿呀？他从自己的记事本上查到了那个日期，那天夜里他在市长宅邸里参加晚宴。安吉拉居然和B.M.孤男寡女相处了一个晚上！那天他回来的时候她是不是还没有睡下等着他？他仔细地回忆着那个晚上的一切。屋子里的情况是不是跟平时一样呢？椅子有没有并排放着？桌子上是不是放着酒杯？一点印象都没有了，他什么都记不起来了，能记起来的只有他在晚宴上的那番演讲词。他的妻子单独接待了一个他根本不认识的男人——整件事情、整个场景，越来越解释不清楚了。他赶忙去拿最后一本日记，或许所有的解释都能在这本日记里面找到。这本日记，是她生前正在写的一本。“与B.M.一起吃饭……他越发显得急躁。他说是时候让我们互相理解了……我坚持要先把我的意见说出来，可是他听不进去，他甚至威胁我，说如果我不……”接下来的话都被涂抹了，这一整页都只剩下一连串的“埃及。埃及。埃及……”他根本看不懂是什么意思，但是只剩下一种合理的解释了——那个混蛋想要她做他的情妇！他的房间里，没有第三人在场！基尔伯德·克兰顿顿时热血上涌，全都向着脸上聚来。他翻日记的速度也加快了，他迫切地想要知道她是怎么答复的。可是那个首字母再也不出现了。出现的全都是“他”。“他又过来了。我对他说我没办法做出什么决定……我央求他不要再缠着我。”他居然想要强迫她，而且就在他的房子里！可是她什么都没有跟他说，到底是为什么呢？在这种时候她怎么能够遮遮掩掩畏畏缩缩呢？“我写了一封信给他。”然后写了这么一句话，后面则是一连几页的空白。“没有回信。”又出现一句，接下来又是几页的空白，然后写道：“他居然真的做了先前用以威胁我的事。”接下来又会是什么呢？他一页一页地往后翻着，空白，还是空白，直到她死亡的前一天，终于又出现了一行字：“我是否也有勇气这么做呢？”日记的结尾就是这句话。

日记本从基尔伯德·克兰顿的手里滑落到地板上。她好像就站在他的面前，她瞪着眼睛，她攥着拳头，她站在皮卡迪利的道牙上，然后一辆汽车飞驰过来……

这让他不能承受，他疾走几步来到电话机旁，这件事必须查个水落石出。

“米勒小姐！”先是沉默。随后他听见房间里响起脚步声。

“我是茜茜·米勒。”——她的声音终于回复了他。

“B.M.是谁？”他咆哮道。

他能听见她的壁炉上那只廉价的钟发出的声音，她长长地叹了一口气，说：“他是我哥哥。”

她哥哥？他居然是她那个自杀了的哥哥？那头茜茜·米勒说：“有什么需要我解释的吗？”

“没有！”他吼道，“不必！”

他已经知道她遗赠给他的是什么了。她把什么都说明白了。她踏出人行道是为了去和她的情夫相聚，她是为了逃离他才踏出道牙的。

探照灯


这座十八世纪的伯爵宅邸在二十世纪变成了一所俱乐部。坐在廊柱森立，吊灯悬顶的大厅中，伴着耀眼的灯光，享受完晚餐，漫步到阳台上观景，俯览整个公园，那种感觉真的是美妙极了。树木枝繁叶茂，每当月亮出来，人们就能在栗树林上看到粉白色的冠冕。但那是一个温暖宜人的无月之夜，在一个阳光明媚的夏季白日后。

阳台上，艾维米夫妇的客人们正在那里抽烟，喝咖啡。仿佛是为了让他们免于交谈，让他们能毫不费力地放松娱乐，有一道光线旋转着从天空划过。那会儿的局势比较和平。空军正在进行演习，搜寻着空中的敌方战机。在停下来探查过一个可疑地点后，灯光再次旋转起来，就像是风车的翼板，或者某种巨型昆虫的触角一样。石质建筑物的正面被它照得一片惨白，一棵正在盛开的栗树也显现出来，然后灯光突然照射到阳台上，闪出另一道亮光，那是一个锃亮的圆盘——很可能是某位女士手提袋里的化妆镜。

“快看！”艾维米夫人忽然叫道。

灯光已经掠过了这边，黑暗又重新将他们笼罩。

她接着说：“你们绝对猜不到我看到了什么！”于是他们纷纷猜测起来。

“不，不，不是。”可是她却一一否定。没有人能猜到，只有她知道，只有她能知道，因为她是那个男人的曾孙女。他给她讲过那个故事。什么样的故事呢？如果他们想听，她可以试着讲出来。反正距离开戏还有一段时间。

“该从什么地方讲起呢？”她思忖着，“一八二○年？……那时候我曾祖父还是个孩子。现在连我自己都不再年轻了。”不是的，她非常漂亮，风姿绰约。“当我还是个孩子时，他告诉了我这个故事，那时他已经是一个老人了。一个非常英俊的老人，一头蓬乱的白发，湛蓝的眼睛。从前他准是个帅气的小伙子。说来奇怪……不过也是自然的，”她解释道，“如果看见他们是怎么生活的。库默，这是他的姓氏。这个家族曾经非常有名气，文人雅士辈出，在约克郡有地产。但后来家道中落，在他还是个孩子的时候，家里仅剩一座塔楼了，住的房子也只是坐落在田野中间的小农舍。十年前我们曾见过它，还刻意地细细观察了它一番。我们不得不把车留在外面，步行穿过田野，因为没有一条道路能通向那所房子。那里只有那一所房子，荒草长得足有大门高……屋里屋外到处都是四处觅食的鸡群，一切都破败不堪。我记得塔楼上还突然掉下来一块石头。”她略作停顿，又继续说道：“他们，一个老人，一个女人，以及一个男孩，就住在那样一个地方。女人并不是他的妻子，也不是男孩的妈妈。她只是一个雇农，是他的妻子去世后，他带着一起生活的女孩。这也许是没有人来拜访他们的另一个原因——也是这片地方显得如此破败不堪的另一个原因。我还记得门上的族徽，当然，还有那些书，那些发霉的旧书。正是这些书，让他拥有了那么多知识。他跟我说他将那些旧书读了一遍又一遍，书里常常有地图探出书页。他将那些书用绳子拉到了塔楼的顶上——那根绳子和那个破破烂烂的楼梯现在都还在呢。那条座板都没了的椅子还在窗户里。窗户开着，玻璃碎了，窗框吱嘎摇晃，从这儿能够眺望数英里的荒野。”

讲到这儿，她停顿了一下，就好像正从塔楼的那扇敞开的、摇晃的窗户向外眺望。

“可惜我们没法……”她说，“找到望远镜。”餐厅里碗碟碰撞的叮当声从他们背后传来。艾维米夫人坐在阳台上，显得那么无奈，因为她找不到望远镜。

“为什么要望远镜？”有人问。

“为什么？要是没有望远镜的话，”她大笑，“我现在就不能坐在这里了。”

当然，这个风姿绰约、仪态万千的中年妇女现在就坐在这儿，肩膀上有个蓝蓝的东西。

“它一定在那儿，”她接着说道，“因为，他告诉过我，每个当老人们都上床歇息后的夜晚，他都会坐在窗前，捧着望远镜看天上的星星。木星，仙后座，金牛座。”她举起手来，向树林上方那些朝她眨眼的星星挥了挥手。天色渐暗，探照灯看上去更亮了，它在天空中扫来扫去，这儿停停，那儿顿顿，凝视着星星。

“它们在那儿，”她继续说，“那些星星。那个男孩——我的曾祖父——问自己：‘它们是什么？它们为什么会在那儿？我又是谁呢？’一个人独自坐在那里，没有可以说话的人，望着星星时，他就是这么做的。”

她沉默了。大家望着树林之上点亮黑夜的星星，那些亘古不变的星星。喧闹的伦敦沉寂下来。弹指一挥间百年光阴。他们感觉男孩正同他们仰望同一片星空。他们好像和他在一起，在那座塔楼里，眺望着原野上空的星星。

此时，一个声音在他们身后说：

“没错，就是星期五。”

他们转过身来，身体挪动的瞬间，便又重新坠落回了阳台上。

“‘没错——就是星期五——’，唉，可是那时候却没有人在他耳边像这样说话。”她喃喃道。那对夫妇起身，告辞离开了。

“他独自一人，”她继续说，“那是盛夏六月的一个晴天。那些完美夏日中的一天，所有的一切都好像处在酷暑之中。鸡群在农场院子里啄食；老马在马厩里跺脚；老人端着杯子打盹儿；女人在清洗间里涮桶。或许会有一个石头从塔上掉落。仿佛一天永远都不会有尽头。他没有人可以说话——也没有什么事可以做。整个世界在他眼前铺展开来。荒野起起伏伏，与天空相接。绿的，蓝的，蓝的，绿的，永永远远。”

他们可以看到，在这明暗参半的阳台上，艾维米夫人正倚靠在那里，两只手托着自己的下巴，就好像正从塔楼的顶上眺望整个荒原。“只有寥廓的高天，苍茫的大地，苍茫的大地，寥廓的高天，永永远远。”她喃喃自语道。

然后她做了那么一个动作，像是要把某样东西甩到真正属于它的某个地方似的。

“要是用望远镜来瞭望这片大地，它会是什么样子的呢？”说着，她又做了一个十分敏捷的小动作，手指像是在拧动着某样事物。

“他把望远镜朝向大地，”她说，“他调整着它，让它对准极远处的那一大片幽暗的树林。以便他能看清……每一棵树……每一棵独立的树……还有鸟群……起起落落……一道孤烟……在那里……在树林中间。……接着……低一点……再低一点……（她垂下眼睛）……那儿有一栋房子……夹在树林中间……是一间农舍……每块砖头都清晰可见……蓝色、粉色的花儿，绣球花儿，栽在花盆里，摆放在门的两边，或许……”她略微停顿，“正巧从屋里走出一个小姑娘……头上戴着某种蓝色的饰物……她就站在那里……给鸟儿喂食……是鸽子……它们在她周围盘旋……接着……看……一个男人……一个男人！他从拐角走出来。他环抱住她！他们接吻了……他们接吻了。”

艾维米夫人张开自己的双臂，然后抱拢，就像是正在亲吻着一个人。

“这是他第一次看见一个男人亲吻一个女人——在他的望远镜里——在数英里之外的荒野！”

她像是推开了什么东西——或许是望远镜吧。然后直起腰来，就那样坐着。

“于是，他从楼上跑了下去，奔过荒野，沿着小路一直跑，然后上了大路，然后穿过树林。不知跑了有多久，当星星刚好出现在树林的头顶时，他终于到达了那座房子……满面风尘，汗水沾衣……”

她停住了，就好像她看见了他。

“然后呢？接下来发生了什么？他们有没有做什么？他有没有说什么，那个女孩……”他们迫不及待地问道。

一个光柱扫到艾维米夫人身上，就好像有人用望远镜对准了她。（那实际上是空军在搜寻敌机。）她站起身来，头上戴着某样蓝色的饰物。她举起双手，仿佛站在门道里，一脸吃惊的样子。

“啊！那个女孩……她是我——”她稍微迟疑了一下，就好像要说“我自己”。但她回想起来，便纠正了自己，“她就是我的曾祖母！”她说。

她回身去找那件披风，它就放在她身后的一把椅子上。

“告诉我们——那个从拐角走出来的男人呢？那个男人他怎么样了？”他们问道。

“那个男人？那个男人——”艾维米夫人喃喃地说，弯腰抚摸着那件披风（探照灯离开了阳台），“他应该消失了，我想。”

“这灯，”她一边说，一边收拾东西，“总是这儿扫一扫，那儿扫一扫。”

探照灯从这里扫了过去，现在正照向那个广阔而素洁的地方——白金汉宫。他们要出去看戏了。





镜中的女人——一幅映像


人们不应再在房间里挂镜子，就像不应该曝露信函和支票簿，来昭示自己的罪恶一样。那一个夏日的午后，你坐在客厅深处的沙发上，不由自主地往外面门厅的长镜里瞅了一眼。一切都是造化使然。你在沙发深处，能从这面意大利镜子里看到对面大理石台面的桌子，还可以看到后面的那片花园，还可以看到花儿铺就的高堤中间，有一条漫长的绿草小径蜿蜒盘旋，然后被镜子的金边切掉一个角。

房间里空荡荡的，你独自一人待在客厅里，这时候你就会觉得自己像个博物学家，躺在青草和树叶下面，观察着那些胆小的动物们——比如獾、水獭、翠鸟——自由地在活动，而自己却不被它们发现。那一个下午，房间里全是这样胆小的东西，光影交错，飘动的窗帘，凋落的花瓣——从来没有发生过的景象，大致就是这样的情景，如果有人在看的话。在这间古老而静谧的乡村房屋里，有小地毯和石头砌成的壁炉，以及被压弯了腰的书橱和红金色的柜子，到处都是这些白天蛰伏，夜里出来活动的东西。它们打着旋儿踩着地板跑过去，高抬爪子，舒展尾巴，迈着轻轻的步子，用有着暗示作用的喙啄来啄去，如同白鹤，抑或是一群群褪去粉色、举止优雅的火烈鸟们，再或是尾翎上镀了一层银膜的孔雀。还有那模模糊糊的红彩和乌光，像一只乌贼忽然朝天空喷吐了一团团紫色的体液。这屋子如同一个人一样，有着自身的悲伤、愤怒、妒忌和疯狂，它们从心头涌出来，整个将它笼罩。所有的一切都变化莫测。

但门厅外的镜子却精准地映照出桌子、向日葵和花园里的小径，如同把它们固定了一样，它们无处可逃，也无法逃脱，牢牢地被固定在那里。两相对照，这种感觉特别奇妙——一边古井无波，静止不动；一边波澜壮阔，时时变化。你会忍不住看看这边，望望那边。与此同时，因为天气太热的原因门窗全都敞开着，所以总有不停的叹息声、停息声、飘忽之声、死亡之声，它们不断地往复来去，就如同人的呼吸一样。可是镜子里呢，所有的一切都在朦胧中保持静默，固守永恒，无声无息。

半小时前，房屋的女主人伊莎贝拉·泰森穿着一身薄如蝉翼的夏装，挎着一只篮子走上绿草小径，然后杳无踪影，她被镀了金边儿的镜子边角给切掉了。可能她是到花园深处采摘花朵去了吧，或者这样推测似乎更加合情合理，那就是去采诸如葡萄叶铁丝莲，或缠绕在丑陋墙壁上的绽放着白色或紫色花朵的优雅旋花之类的藤蔓悠长、叶片茂盛、既小巧又奇特的花朵。想到她，你所联想到的只会是令人战栗的奇美旋花，而不会是笔直的紫菀、挺拔的百日菊，或长在玫瑰树上那犹如挂在高高灯柱上彤红似火的玫瑰。若用这种比喻来形容她，那只能证明即便这么多年过去了，你还是一点也不了解她。一个活生生的女人，只要到了五六十岁这个年龄，她就不可能真是一个花环或是一串卷须了。与其说这种比喻肤浅、无聊，毋宁说它是一种残忍、冷酷。一旦有了这种比喻，就像是旋花于真实情况和人的眼睛之间的颤抖。真实的一面肯定是有的。那一堵墙，也肯定是存在的。认识伊莎贝拉的年头也不算短了，可是有一件奇怪的事，那就是你根本说不清楚她真实的那一面到底是什么样的，而你只能捏造一些诸如旋花、葡萄叶铁丝莲等的意象。要说事实，事实上她是一个有着很多钱的老小姐。她不仅买下了这所房子，还亲自去收集了椅子、橱柜、地毯等，这些东西每每都在世界最偏僻的角落，寻觅的过程中还充斥着被毒刺叮蛰或染上东方疾病的危险。这些东西现在就在你的眼前，它们白天里蛰伏，只有在夜里才会活动。有时候看上去好像它们比我们更了解她，毕竟她在它们上面坐过，在它们旁边写过，在它们上面小心翼翼地踩过。所有的橱柜都带着许多小抽屉，几乎每一个小抽屉里都放有信件，用缎带打着蝴蝶结系着，上面撒有玫瑰花瓣或者薰衣草秆。这又是另一个事实——如果你只是对事实感兴趣的话——伊莎贝拉有很多朋友，她认识很多人。假如有谁敢打开一个抽屉，偷看她的信件，那他肯定会发现各种各样的痕迹：有许多焦躁的情绪，有要赴约的见面，有失约的谴责，也有卿卿我我、情意绵绵的长信，也有嫉妒斥责、言辞激烈的信，还有绝望伤感的分手信——所有的约会都以失败而告终——因此，她至今都还没有结婚。可是，你能从她那如同戴了一张面具的冰冷面孔里看出，她有着丰富的感情，并且在这方面经历过很多的坎坷。跟那些吹捧爱情的人相比，跟那些生怕别人不知道什么是爱情的人相比，她是更高明的一类。越多猜想伊莎贝拉，你就越会觉得她的房间光怪陆离，充满象征，角落越来越暗了，桌腿越来越细了，越来越像符咒。

所有的映像忽然间就悄无声息地消失了。镜子里出现了一个巨大无比的黑影，它矗立在那里，把所有的东西都遮住了。它在桌子上洒下一把粉色和灰色纹络的大理石石片儿，然后它不见了。可是画面已经不再是原先的画面了。一瞬间，画面变得难以辨认，怪诞离奇，完全失去了焦距。你无法将这些石头片儿和人类的某种目的相挂钩。接着，某种逻辑程序启动了，慢慢地开始对它们产生作用，重新将它们排列整理一番，终于把它们纳入了日常生活经验的范畴里。这时候你才认出来，原来它们不过是几封信件。一个男人送来了这些信件。

它们在大理石台面的桌子上沉睡着，所有的流光溢彩最初都是粗糙的，无法融通的。可是后来，它们被重新排列后，被聚拢到一起，成为整体画面的组成部分，镜子将它的永恒和静谧赐予了它们，这一下，景象可就意义非凡了。虽然躺在那里，可是它们拥有了一种崭新的意义，本身变得真实了，有了一种厚重感，仿佛你若要将它们从桌子上挖下来，没有一把凿子是不行的。无论是不是异想天开，它们不再是几封无足轻重的信了，它们变成了铭刻着永恒真理的石碑，——只要你能读到它们，那么有关伊莎贝拉的一切你就都可以清楚了，除此之外，你还可以获得有关生命的真理。在大理石一样的信封中，肯定全都是蕴含深理，令人无法一刻就忘的词句。伊莎贝拉进来后，就会拿起它们，从容地把它们一封封打开，一字一句地认真读完，最后她会如洞悉沧桑一般，心有所悟地长叹一声，将所有的信封都撕成碎片，把信纸扎成一束。她会把它们锁进橱柜的抽屉里，将不想被别人知悉的世界隐藏起来。

这种想法多少有些挑衅的意味。伊莎贝拉不想别人知道——可是她一味逃避也并非是个好办法。这很荒唐，很滑稽，不可理喻。她越是知道得多，越是隐藏得多，你就越是想用自己的想象力——这种最常见的工具来撬开她。那一刻，你必须把全部的心神都投注在她的身上，牢牢盯紧她。你必须摆脱即时进行的对话、动作的干扰——不被造访、宴会和文雅的交谈影响。你必须踩进她的鞋子里——如果你从字面上理解这句话，你轻易就可以看到，此时她正站在花园的低洼处，脚上穿着那双鞋子。鞋子窄窄长长，时下非常流行——它是用最柔韧的皮革制作的，做工非常精良，就如她身上穿的每一件衣饰一样。可能她正站在花园的低洼处，抽出系在腰上的剪刀，拿着它剪掉那些枯萎的花朵，或者剪掉那些长得太突出的树枝。太阳照射在了她的脸上，照射进她的眼睛里，但是，在这紧要时刻，一朵薄薄的云彩遮住了太阳，她的眼睛一下就变得迷离起来——是感动还是嘲讽，是明亮还是空洞？那张脸抬起来，仰望着天空，可是你看到的只是一个朦胧的轮廓，它已经略显衰老了，不过看起来仍然风韵犹存。她可能正在想，该是时候去订购一张新网了，好继续保护草莓；该是时候把花送给约翰逊的遗孀了；该是时候坐车去拜访一下西裴斯莱的新家了。这些事情她多半会在吃饭的时候提起，不过她在吃饭时谈论的事情都已经让你烦不胜烦了。只有那种更深层次的生活情状，才是你想从她那里获悉并谈论的，那种状态对于精神的意义就如呼吸对于身体的意义一样，那种东西通常你会称其为幸运或者不幸。说起这些字眼，她肯定非常幸福，这是毋庸置疑的。因为她有很多钱，她非常出色，她有很多朋友，而且她经常去旅行——她的地毯是在土耳其买的，她的蓝色花盆是在波斯买的。当她正用剪刀剪那颤巍巍的枝条时，薄云遮住了她的脸，她所站立的地方，向外散发出各种各样快乐的感觉。

她手中的剪刀猛然一颤，葡萄叶铁丝莲的那根枝条断了，掉落在地上。当它掉落的那一刻，定会有一抹光线穿透进来，她的内心世界，又向你敞开了一点。此时，她的心被柔弱和怜惜之感所包裹……她会因为一根长势太过突出的枝条被剪掉而伤心难过，它毕竟曾活在这世界上，可见在她的心目中生命是极其珍贵的。是的，与此同时，那落在地上的枝条，让她想到世界上所有的一切都是短暂的，都是无奈的，她也想到自己的生命也总有一天会从世间消逝。但是，因为具有即时反应的本领，这种思绪很快就被她驱逐出脑海，她想生活并没有薄待她。哪怕有一天她会坠落，那也是落入了大地的怀抱里，甜美地腐烂着，融进了紫罗兰的根系里。她站在那里，任由思绪驰骋。她其实并不明确自己在想什么，心里的想法根本就没有一个头绪——因为她是那种只会在心里想，而不会把想法说出来的人——她沉默寡言，如同被禁言的云团笼罩。她的心，就如一间小屋，光线舒展尾翎，在屋里随意飞旋，步履轻盈，进退自如，把自己的前路啄开，而后她的整个身心就如房间一样，被某种浓厚的才气、某种不可言说的落寞和遗憾充盈着，她的身心就如她的橱柜一样，有着许许多多上了锁的抽屉，里面藏着满满当当的信件。说到“撬开她”，就好像她是一只牡蛎，除了那些特别精妙，而且顺手的工具外，你对她使用任何工具都显得荒唐、不近人情。你只需想象——她就在镜子里。它会使你震惊。

起初她离你太远，你无法看清她，后来她走走停停，在流连与徘徊中走过来，有时扶起一根石竹，把鼻子凑上去闻一闻，有时又扶直一朵玫瑰，但总也不见她停下来，只是镜子里的她好像逐渐变大了，逐渐地完整起来，变成了你企图探究其心灵的那个她。你一点点地把你已经发现的各种品质，放在这个身体上来检验，看是否与实际符合。墨绿色的衣裙，纤长的鞋子，还有她的篮子，以及咽喉上闪闪发光的某样东西。她缓步走来，不慌不忙，镜子里的景象没有一丝紊乱的迹象，仅仅是多了一种新的元素。其他的景物因它而变幻，它轻轻移动，如同在礼貌地请求它们为她让出一点空间。于是原本一直据守在镜子中的桌子、信件、绿草小径和向日葵都分开了，为她让出空间来，欢迎她踏入镜中来。她忽然止步，站在那儿，站在门厅里的桌子旁，一动也不动了。镜子适时溢出一道光彩，照射到她的身上，将她定住了。就像是皮毛被某种酸类给腐蚀了，剩下来的只有真实。云彩、篮子、钻石、衣裙，以及一切你称之为藤蔓植物和旋花的东西，都从她的身上褪去了。这是一幅多么迷人的图景。这儿就是下面坚硬的墙壁，这儿是这个女人本身。她身无片缕地站在无情的光照下，空无一物。伊莎贝拉一无所有。她没有思想，没有朋友，没有牵挂。她的信件，原来不过是些票据和账单。迟暮之人站在那里，你看她，瘦巴巴的，皮肤上爬满皱纹，条条青筋那么明显，还有那皱缩的脖子，高耸的鼻梁。她甚至都没有心思拆开来看看它们。

人们不应该在房间里挂镜子。





狩猎会


进了车厢后，她把行李箱放上架子，又把那对野鸡放在行李箱上，而后坐在了角落里。火车从中部地区一路穿行，车厢似乎被她开门时带进来的雾气给撑大了，四名旅客被雾气完全隔开。显而易见，M.M.——行李箱上的首字母——这个周末参加了一场狩猎会。显而易见，此刻她正斜倚在角落里，回想着这次活动。她没有闭上眼睛，但她显然没有看见对面的那个男人，也没有看见约克大教堂的彩色照片。但她肯定听见了他们的谈话。她的眼睛凝视着前方，嘴唇微微翕动，不时露出微笑。她端庄，优雅，就像一朵百叶蔷薇，又像一颗带有斑斑点点的黄褐色苹果。但她的下颌上有一道疤——她微笑的时候，那道疤痕就被拉长。她定是作为一位客人参与到了她正在回想的那段故事里。但是，她身上穿着早就过时了的衣服，多年前体育报纸时尚版块插图上的女人就是这副装扮，所以她看起来又不像是一位客人，但也不是一名女用。她要是提上一个篮子的话，就跟给狐犬喂食的妇女没什么两样了。当然，也可能是暹罗猫的主人，或是与猎狗与马匹有关的某类人。可是，她带的东西只有一只行李箱，一对野鸡，仅此而已。无论如何，她钻进了这个空间里，她认真打量着周围，视线扫过车厢里的物品，扫过那个男人光秃秃的脑袋，扫过约克大教堂的彩色照片。她一定是听到了他们的谈话，所以才像某人模仿别人的声音一样，从喉咙里发出轻轻的“咯咯”声，然后，她笑了起来。

“咯。”安东尼亚小姐说，她向上推了推鼻梁上的眼镜。

湿润的树叶沿着过道上长长的窗户飘落而下，一两片鱼形的叶子落在玻璃窗上，就像是贴在上面的一两片棕色的木片。猎苑里的树木哗哗颤动着，树叶翩翩然飘落下来，使得这个颤动变得更加清晰可见——这个潮湿、棕色的颤动。

“咯。”安东尼亚小姐又抽了抽鼻子，手指在那块白色的薄片上一个劲点着，就像一只极度紧张的母鸡敏捷地啄食着一块白面包一般。

冷风叹息着。房间通风良好，门和窗户都没有关严。毯子不时泛起一道涟漪，像是有虫子从下面爬过一般。阳光滞留窗边，在地毯上倒映出黄绿色的窗格。而后阳光缓缓移动，伸出一根手指点在地毯上，像是有意嘲讽一样，正巧手指停留在地毯的一个破洞上。然后它又继续挪动，那根柔软而公正的手指点在了壁炉上方的纹章上——温和地照耀着盾牌、长矛、低垂的葡萄串，以及美人鱼。当安东尼亚小姐抬头的时候，光线稍微变强了些。祖辈们拥有大片的土地，他们说——她的祖先——拉瑟里家族。就在那里。上面居住着亚马逊人、海盗、航海者，劫掠绿宝石，巡岛追查，抓捕俘虏、少女。她就在那里，从尾到腰布满鳞片。安东尼亚小姐嘴唇翕动，又笑了。太阳的手指点到哪里，她的目光便跟到哪里，现在它挪到了一个银质相框上，又挪动到相片上，挪到了一个像鸡蛋一样光秃秃的脑袋上，挪到了被胡须衬托出的嘴唇上，最终停留在下面用花体字写着的名字“爱德华”上。

“国王……”安东尼亚小姐低低地说了一句。她把那片白色的薄片翻到自己的膝盖上，抬起头，又说道：“……有一间蓝屋。”光线变暗了。





外面，皇家马道上，野鸡被驱赶着从枪口下飞过去。它们像重型火箭一样，带着紫红色的火焰飞起来，从树林下的灌木丛中猛地冲出来。它们一出来，便响起阵阵急骤、响亮的枪声，就像一排猎狗突然狂吠起来。一朵朵白色的烟雾团，顷刻间凝聚成一整片，然后越来越淡，慢慢化开，最终消散了。

一辆运货马车停在棚子下面那条挖得很深的路上。上面堆满了软绵绵、暖乎乎的躯体，它们的眼睛依旧光芒绽放，可是爪子已经没有力气了。这些鸟儿好像并没有死，只是在厚厚的潮湿的羽毛下晕厥过去了。它们看上去十分放松，舒适极了，偶尔还会动一下，就像睡在车板上一堆温暖的绒毛上。

其后，长着一张丑陋麻脸的农场主，腿上绑着一对破破烂烂的护腿，嘴里骂着不堪入耳的脏话，举起了他的枪。





安东尼亚小姐正在做针线活儿。壁炉里，火舌不时卷住横跨在炉间的灰木，贪婪地将它整个吞食掉，直至熄灭，树皮被啃食掉的地方留下了白色手镯般的痕迹。安东尼亚小姐本能地将头抬起，眼睛瞪得大大的，注视了片刻，就像家犬盯着火苗一样。等火光黯淡后，她又继续做手里的针线活儿。

高大的门无声无息地被推开。两个消瘦的男子走了进来，他们将一张桌子拉过来，放在地毯上那个破洞的正上方。他们出去，进来，在桌上铺上一块桌布；他们出去，进来，拎着一只篮子，篮底铺着一块绿呢，里面装着刀叉、杯子、面包、放着盐巴和糖的瓶瓶碟碟，还有一只里面插有三朵菊花的银瓶。桌子已经张罗好了。安东尼亚小姐继续做她的针线活儿。

轻轻地，门又被推开了。一只哈巴狗慢悠悠地溜达进来，用它那灵敏的鼻子这儿嗅嗅，那儿嗅嗅，然后停下来。门还没有关上时，老拉瑟里小姐拄着拐杖从外面颤巍巍地走进来，她那光秃秃的头顶被一条裹成钻石形的白色披巾给遮住了。她蹒跚走进屋里，把身体蜷缩在壁炉边上的高背椅上。安东尼亚小姐还在做她的针线活儿。

“打猎呢。”她总算开口说了一句话。

老拉瑟里小姐点了点头。“在皇家马道呢。”她说。她紧握着她的拐杖。她们坐在那里，静候着。





猎手们已经从皇家马道转移到了家族山林中。他们站在外面紫色的农田里。不时有细小的树枝折断，树叶打着转从树上飞下来。雾霭之上，一座蓝色岛屿——淡蓝，纯蓝——孤悬在空中。纯澈的天空中，一阵钟声从远方尖塔处传来，宛如一只自由自在游弋在天空中的天使一样，它欢快地嬉戏着，蹦跳着，最后渐渐消失。接着，那些火箭再一次飞腾起来，那些紫红色的野鸡一窝蜂地向上飞逃。枪声再一次响起，一朵朵烟雾团又聚集成形，然后又化开，消散。小狗们忙了起来，奔跑在田野上，用自己灵敏的鼻子这儿嗅嗅，那儿嗅嗅，一个劲地搜寻着。那潮湿、温热的躯体已经失去了力气，变得软弱无力，就好像昏睡过去了一样，被绑着裹腿的男人们捆成束，丢进大车里。

“行啦！”女管家米莉·马什特斯把眼镜摘下来，轻声道。她正坐在那间能监看整个马厩的黑漆漆的小屋里，手上也在做针线活，是给她那打扫教堂的儿子做的一件套衫。这件粗糙的羊毛套衫已经织好了。“做好啦！”她轻轻地说，然后她听见了马车的动静，车轮从鹅卵石铺就的路面上碾过。她站了起来。双手捂拢那头栗色头发，站在庭院里，任凭风吹着。

“我马上来！”她朗笑着，脸上的那道疤痕又拉长了。当她把储藏室的门闩拨开的时候，猎场看守温格正赶着马车从鹅卵石路上驶来。所有的禽鸟都断气了，它们的爪子紧扣着，像是要抓住什么，却什么也没有抓住。它们灰暗的眼皮皱巴巴地蒙在眼睛上。女管家马什特斯太太和猎场看守温格抓住死禽的脖子，一捆捆将它们扔进野味储藏室的石地上。石地被鲜血染红了。这会儿那些野鸡的身体缩在了一起，看起来就跟变小了似的。温格将车尾抬起来，锁好保险销子。车板上全都是鲜血，上面沾满了灰蓝色的细碎羽毛，但车里已经空了。

马车离开了。“最后一批了！”米莉·马什特斯露齿微笑着说。





“夫人，”男管家指着桌子，说，“午餐准备好了！”他所指的地方精确地对着那些他指挥下人摆放好的扣着银盖的佳肴。管家和仆人都站在那里，恭敬待命。

安东尼亚小姐将白色薄皮放在篮子上，把丝线拿到一边，又将顶针从手指上摘下来。她把针都别在一块绒布上，然后取下眼镜，把它挂在胸前的钩子上。她站起身来。

“吃午饭啦！”她附在老拉瑟里小姐的耳边大声喊道。过了一会儿，老拉瑟里小姐蹬了蹬腿，握住拐杖也站起来。两位老妇人慢悠悠走到桌子跟前。管家和男用人把她们搀扶进椅子里，这边一个，对面一个。揭开银盖后，那亮晶晶的、拔光了毛的野鸡，静静地躺在盘子里，大腿紧贴在身侧，两边的面包屑堆成了小山。

安东尼亚小姐用切肉刀在鸡胸上平平地切下一片肉。她切了两片，放进一个盘子里。男用熟练地从她手里接过盘子，老拉瑟里小姐举起了手中的刀叉。忽然，窗户下的树林里响起了枪声。

“来了吗？”老拉瑟里小姐举着叉子，说。

猎苑里的树木，树枝挥动起来，颤摆不已。

她咬了一口鸡肉。树叶飘落下来，敲打在玻璃窗上，有一两片贴在了玻璃上。

“这会儿到家族山林了，”安东尼亚小姐说，“休最后一次打猎的地方。”

她下刀，从鸡脯的另一侧切下去，而后在肉的周围依次地加上土豆泥和肉汁，又浇上甘蓝和面包沙司调味，在盘中围成了一个圈。管家与男用们像是盛大宴席上的侍应生一样站在边上，静候着。两位老妇人一句话也不说，静静地吃着饭，她们吃得很慢，一点也不着急，最后把那只野鸡吃得干干净净，只剩下了盘子里的骨头。男管家举着酒瓶，站在安东尼亚小姐跟前，垂着脑袋，静候着。

“就放在这儿吧，格里菲思。”安东尼亚小姐边说，边用手指夹起骨头扔向桌子下面的那条哈巴狗。管家和男用们躬身行礼后，退了出去。

“不远了！”拉瑟里小姐侧耳凝听，说道。风呼呼地刮着，一阵昏暗的震颤搅动了空气，树叶飞速地飘落，无法再贴到窗子上了，窗玻璃哗啦啦地乱颤。

“鸟受惊了。”安东尼亚小姐点了点头，望着外面乱糟糟的景象，说。





老拉瑟里小姐把自己的杯子倒满。两位老妇人轻酌慢饮，眼睛里的光彩就如宝石在光照下所折射出的一样。拉瑟里小姐的眼睛是石青色的，安东尼亚小姐的眼睛是葡萄酒红的。她们喝酒的时候，连她们衣服上绣的花边儿和莲叶都在颤动，就像是温软而慵懒的身体被护在羽毛之下。

“你还记得吗？也是这样的一天。”老拉瑟里小姐说，她的手指在酒杯上拨弄了一下。“他们把他送回来——一颗子弹贯穿了他的心窝。他们说，一根刺藤绊住了他的脚……”她咯咯地笑着，抿了一口酒。

“还有约翰……”安东尼亚小姐说。“他们说，那匹母马踩进了地窟窿里，死在了野外。猎手们的马从他的身上踏了过去。他也回来了，躺在一扇百叶窗上……”

她们又饮了一口酒。

“还记得丽莉吗？”老拉瑟里小姐说，“那个坏蛋。”她摇了摇头，“她骑着马，手杖上拴着个红穗儿……”

“坏到家了！”安东尼亚小姐嚷嚷着说。

“上校写来的信你还记得吧？‘你的儿子就像是被二十个魔鬼缠住一样——骑在马上疯了似的往前冲。’然后一个白鬼——哈哈哈！”她又喝了一口酒。

“我们家的男人们——”拉瑟里小姐开口道，她举起酒杯，将它举得高高的，像是要跟壁炉上的石膏雕刻的美人鱼干杯。她顿住了。枪声划破天际。咔嚓一声响，不知是什么木头器具发出的，也或许是石膏雕像后面有一只耗子在乱窜？

“总是女人们……”安东尼亚小姐点了点头，“我们家的男人们。你还记得磨坊的露西吗，那个白白净净的小姑娘？”

“你是说山羊镰刀店艾伦的女儿？”老拉瑟里小姐说。

“还有裁缝店的那个姑娘，”安东尼亚小姐喃喃道，“休的马裤就是在那家店买的，右边那间阴沉沉的小店……”

“……那里一到冬天就要发洪水。就是他家的儿子，”安东尼亚小姐咯咯地笑着，边说边往她姐姐那边靠拢，“在打扫教堂。”

哗啦！从烟囱里掉下来一块石板，把那根大木头一下砸成两段。壁炉上方的盾牌掉下一块石膏片儿。

“掉了，掉了！”老拉瑟里小姐大笑。





“该是谁，”安东尼亚小姐看着地毯上的碎片，说道，“该让谁来赔偿？”





她们宛如老顽童一般地嬉笑着，无拘无束，无所顾忌。她们走到壁炉跟前，站在灰烬和石膏碎片旁饮着她们的雪利酒[1]。杯中酒已经见底了，只剩下最后一滴紫红色的液体。她们彼此紧挨着，坐在灰烬旁边玩赏着手中的酒杯，却再也没有把杯子放到过嘴唇边上，似乎最后这一滴酒令这两位老太太舍不得一饮而尽。

“米莉·马什特斯在野味储藏室里，”老拉瑟里小姐开口说道，“她是我们兄弟的……”

窗户下又传来枪声。雨帘被生生切断，大雨骤然洒落下来，如柱子一般笔直地击落到窗玻璃上。地毯上的光暗了下来。两位老太太坐在白色的灰烬旁，眼睛里的光彩同样黯淡了下来，她们静静地凝听，眼珠灰暗、干涩，如同刚从水里捞出来的鹅卵石一样。她们的手如同那些抓不住任何东西的死禽的爪子一般，紧紧地攥着。她们变得无精打采，宛如身体在衣服里面悄然枯萎了一样。

安东尼亚小姐又举起酒杯，对着那美人鱼。她喝下了最后一滴酒。“来了！”她像年迈的乌鸦一样沙哑着嗓子说了一句，而后放下了酒杯。一扇门发出巨响，接着又一扇门发出巨响，接二连三。能听见脚步声、拖拽声，从走廊那边朝凉厅这边移近。

“近了！更近了！”拉瑟里小姐露出她的三颗大黄牙，张嘴笑道。

那扇高大的门被推开了。三条猎狗从门外冲了进来，然后站住不动，大喘粗气。紧接着疲惫的庄园主本人走了进来，他腿上裹着绑腿。猎狗摇晃着脑袋，绕着他跑动，嗅着他的口袋，然后忽然向前跳去，脊背和尾巴如同汹涌的波浪般，从凉厅的地板上极速扫过，四下寻觅着，它们闻到了肉味。它们在桌子上嗅嗅，又在桌布上挠挠。然后，伴着一阵如同马儿嘶鸣般的叫声，忽然扑向正在桌子底下啃骨头的黄毛小狐犬。

“该死的！真该死！”庄园主怒叱，可是他的声音像是迎着大风喊出来一样虚弱不堪。“真该死，真该死！”他大声怒叱。不过这一次是冲着他的姐姐骂的。

安东尼亚小姐和拉瑟里小姐跳了起来。那只小狐犬已经被几条大狗给逮住了。大狗们戏弄着它，用他们那大黄牙叼它。庄园主手里挥舞着一条打结的皮鞭，左抽一下，右抽一下，嘴里大声喝骂着，不知是骂狗，还是骂他的姐姐。不过他的骂声根本没有威慑力。那瓶菊花被他的鞭子抽到了地上。老拉瑟里小姐的脸被他的鞭子抽到了，跌跌撞撞地往后躲去，撞到了壁炉台上。她胡乱挥动着她的拐杖，打到了壁炉上的盾牌。拉瑟里家的盾牌从墙上掉下来，然后她自己也跌倒在了炉灰上。她被美人鱼压住了，被长矛压住了。

大风狠狠摇晃着玻璃窗。猎苑里传来连绵不绝的枪声。一棵树倒下了。银框里的国王爱德华也摇摇晃晃，滑了一下，从上面掉了下来。





车厢里的雾气越发厚重，越发朦胧，宛如一面纱巾遮盖下来。角落里的四名旅客也似乎被它隔得越来越远，实际上他们仍然像三等车厢所限定的那样，挨得非常近。这情景实在奇怪。这位从中部某一站上了火车，衣衫破旧却品位不俗、风韵犹存的老妇女此时此刻已经失去了她的轮廓，她的身体已经被雾气所同化。不过那双眼睛依然炯炯有神，明亮、灵动。这双与身体隔离的眼睛，能看见别人所看不到的东西，它们在迷蒙的雾气中闪烁着，转动着，在这坟墓般的氛围中——玻璃窗被迷雾蒙上，灯光被迷雾劫掠——它们像人们谣传的游弋在墓园中不眠逝者坟墓上的鬼火一样，闪烁着明光。这个想法真是滑稽！真是够天马行空的！既然世间没有不留下任何残留的事物，那么记忆就是当现实被埋葬后，跃动在脑海中的一盏明灯。既然如此，那为何那双灵动的、闪亮的眼睛不能成为一个家族、一个时代、一个文明的灵魂在坟墓上曼舞呢？

火车变慢了，灯一盏接着一盏地亮起，黄色的光芒晃了一会儿，接着便熄灭了。当火车进站后，灯又亮了，发出耀眼的光芒。那双角落里的眼睛呢？它们闭上了，或许是因为灯光太强了。这很正常的，毕竟车站的灯光太刺眼了——她是一个再普通不过的年迈女人，去伦敦办一件日常小事而已——一件与猫猫狗狗或马匹有关的小事。她站了起来，伸手去拿行李箱。她把野鸡从行李架上拿下来。当她推开车厢的门并走出去时，是不是一边走一边发出“咯咯”的轻笑呢？

[1]　西班牙安达鲁西亚贺雷兹产的一种强化型葡萄酒。





邱　园


无数的花枝在椭圆形的花坛里舒展着腰肢，上面长满心形的、舌形的叶片，红色、蓝色、黄色的花瓣在枝头一一绽放，花瓣的表面有一颗颗凸起的斑点。一根根挺直的花柱从红的、蓝的或黄的花蕊里伸出来，金色的花粉将其涂抹得毛茸茸的，其顶端是一个粗粗的肉球。夏风微拂，无数花瓣随风摇曳，红黄蓝三色彩光交相辉映，在棕色的大地上投下斑驳绚烂的图斑。绮丽的彩光还洒落在鹅卵石平滑的灰背上，也投影在螺旋状花纹蜗牛的灰色外壳上，甚至是一滴雨露里。雨露薄弱的壁膜，被明艳的红黄蓝三种颜色撑大，你看了会不由自主地担心，它会不会被撑破，顷刻间就破灭？可是，这时候有一片厚厚的叶子抢夺了那光彩，雨珠只能再次变回银灰色。随着光彩的游走，叶片上面交错纵横的叶脉清晰可见，而被心形或舌形树叶遮挡住的无垠的绿茵世界一下子被那光明扩张开来。头顶的和风吹得稍微猛烈了一些，将那斑斓的光彩如数吹进了盛夏七月间前来游园的男男女女的眼睛中。

这些男女信步游走在花坛之中，没有既定的路线，令人称奇，像极了那盘旋飞舞在花坛间草坪上的蓝白相间的蝴蝶。一名男子在坛中随意地闲逛着，距他身后六英寸左右有一名女子，显然是诚心来游玩的。这名女子不时回头看上一眼，以防孩子们跑得太远。男子或许是刻意的，也或许是下意识的，与女子保持着这个距离，走在她的前面，他希望能边走边思考一些事情。

“我和丽莉曾经来过这里，那应该是十五年前吧。”他思索着，“那天天气很热，我们坐在那边的湖畔上，整整一个下午，我都用来向她求婚。记得有一只蜻蜓，它总是绕着我们飞来飞去。所有的一切都恍若昨日：那只蜻蜓，她的那只鞋，还有鞋尖上的那只方方正正的银纽扣。我说话的时候，总是盯着那只鞋，我不用抬头，只要看到它躁动不安地动弹一下，我就知道她想说什么了，就好像整个她都在她的这只鞋里一样；而我的爱情，我的欲望，则在那只蜻蜓身上。不知出于什么原因，我认为只要这只蜻蜓落在那边，落在那片中间有一朵红花的叶子上，只要蜻蜓落在那片宽大的叶子上，她就一定会立刻答应我。但是那只蜻蜓却总是转啊，转啊，怎么也不落下来，哪儿都没有落——当然没有落，还好没有落，不然我也没机会带着埃莉诺和孩子们在这里游逛了。告诉我，埃莉诺，你有没有回忆过以前？”

“怎么突然问起这个了，西蒙？”

“因为我总是想起过去，想起丽莉，那个我可能与之结婚的女人……好吧，你为什么不说话了？你介意我回想过去吗？”

“我为什么要介意呢，西蒙？看到男男女女在花园里散步，躺在树荫下，谁又能不想起过去呢？那些男女，躺在树下的幽灵——不正是我们俩的曾经，唯一留存下来的曾经的碎片吗？不正是我们的幸福，我们的真实吗？”

“对我来说，那是鞋上的一个四四方方的银纽扣，和一只蜻蜓——”

“对我来说，那是一个吻。想象一下，二十年前有六个小姑娘坐在湖畔的画架前，描摹着睡莲，那火红的睡莲我还是第一次见。我忽然感到后颈被人吻了一下。我的手因此抖了整整一个下午，再也没办法画画。我掏出表紧盯着指针，我只允许自己回味那个吻五分钟，那是多么珍贵的一个吻！它来自一个白发苍苍、鼻子上还长着个大疙瘩的老太婆。我的一生再也忘不了那个吻，它是那么的刻骨铭心。卡罗琳，休伯特，快过来，过这儿来！”

他们沿着花坛继续往回走着，变成四个人并排行走。不大会儿，他们的身影越来越小，走进了树林中。他们的后背上，斑驳的阳光摇晃着阴影，浮浮沉沉，他们的身体如同变得透明了一样。

椭圆形的花坛里，两分钟就被染成红、黄、蓝三色的蜗牛壳儿里，蜗牛似乎轻微地动了动，片刻后它就上路了，缓慢地行走在松散的沙粒上。它爬到哪儿，哪儿的沙粒便散开，滚落下来。在前方好像有一个明确的目标等待着它。而那只笨拙的青虫，则与它截然相反，青虫高抬着步子，雄赳赳气昂昂地想要从蜗牛面前横穿过去。不过，它的触须动了动，像是进行了一番细致而深入的思考，略微犹豫了一下后，便用它那快速而怪异的行走方式，朝着相反的方向爬去了。褐色悬崖下的山谷中那深不可测的绿色湖泊；从根茎到树梢都在晃动的扁形植被；还有那灰白浑圆的大卵石；以及劈啪作响的薄叶那巨大多皱的表面——这些障碍横亘在枝杈花茎之间，是蜗牛前往目的地的必经之处。到底是硬闯过去，还是从一片拱起的枯叶帐篷旁边绕道过去，它还没有考虑好。这时，其他几个人沿着花坛边儿走了过来。

这次是两个男人。有一个比较年轻，与同伴说话时，眼睛看着前方，一眨不眨，这份神情恬淡得有些不真实。等同伴说完话之后，他便低头凝望着脚下，要么停顿许久之后才开口，要么干脆不说话。另一个人年龄比较大，走起路来摇摇晃晃，一脚深一脚浅，看起来特别怪异。他就像是一匹在院门外等得太久而失去耐心的马，向后仰仰头，向前甩甩手，不过这种肢体动作对他来说并不代表某种决心，不含有任何深意。他说起话来滔滔不绝，时而会忽然停下脚步，自顾自地笑一笑，如同这一笑就代表一个回答似的，然后接着说。他在谈论灵魂——亡者的灵魂！他说，亡者们现在正在把他们千奇百怪的天国之旅讲给他听。

“威廉，古时候的人们把塞萨利当成天国，现在到处都是战争，亡灵像闪电一样在山野间流窜。”他停顿了一下，像是在倾听什么，然后笑着仰起头，继续说，“你找一节小电池和一块橡胶，把电线绝缘——是隔离还是绝缘？算了，管他呢，细节不重要，反正别人都听不懂，说不说无所谓。总之，你只要在床头上或者随便某个方便的地方，比如精巧的红木台上，装上这小玩意儿——你信我说的，让工匠们装上它，寡妇们就能用她们的耳朵，像接收特定信号一样来招魂了。不过只能是女人！寡妇！穿黑衣服的女人——”

他大概是看见了那个女人的一袭长裙，在树荫的映衬下，像是紫黑色。他把帽子脱下来，嘴里念叨着什么，一只手按在胸口，一只手挥动着，风一般朝那个女人冲过去。但是他的袖子被威廉抓住了，威廉用手杖指着一朵花，想要把年长者的注意力转移到花上。年长者显得很忙乱，朝那朵花看了几眼，如同倾听花儿的话语一般把耳朵凑过去。乌拉圭的森林，他谈起了这个，言称在几个世纪前一位欧洲最美丽的姑娘陪着他去过那里。依稀能听见他的嘴里嘟囔着什么，好像是说乌拉圭的森林里有热带玫瑰那蜡一样的花瓣漫天飞舞，还说什么夜莺、海滩、美人鱼、淹死在海里的女人等。他说这些的时候，威廉便提议快点往前走，他勉强接受建议。威廉波澜不惊的脸上显得越发深邃了。

紧紧跟在他的身后是两个中产阶级下层的老女人，看见他手舞足蹈的样子有些摸不着头脑。这两个女人一个比较壮硕，动作粗笨，另一个脸色莹润，举手投足都非常灵敏。像她们这种阶级的人，都有一个共同的特点：只要见到某种古怪的、疯疯癫癫的行为，尤其是富人的这种行为，她们就会毫不掩饰地表现出强烈的兴趣来。她们离他仍是不够近，不能确定他的这种肢体动作究竟是一种古怪的习惯，还是他发疯了。她们一句话也不说，瞅着那老男人的背影细细琢磨，带着某种让人猜不透的眼神互相看了一眼，然后又兴致高昂地继续她们杂七乱八的对话。

“奈尔，伯特，罗特，赛思，菲尔，父亲，他说，我说，她说，我说，我说，我说——”

“我的伯特，妹妹，比尔，祖父，老人家，糖，糖，面粉，腌鱼，青菜，糖，糖，糖。”

不管对方说得多么好听，那个壮实粗笨的女人都只是用好奇的目光盯着地上那高傲美艳的花朵。她看花时的神态，如同一个人刚刚从睡梦中醒来，忽然看见黄铜烛台的反光般新奇不已，于是又闭上眼睛，再睁开，再次去看黄铜烛台，然后终于清醒过来，所有的心神都集中在上面。健壮的女人最后干脆直挺挺地面向椭圆形花坛站着，连假装倾听对方说话也不愿意了，任凭对方说得多么动听，她都只是一门心思地看着她的花，上半身前后摇摆，俯身，抬身，俯身，抬身。然后她提议不如找个地方坐下来喝口茶。

除了从枯叶上攀爬过去或是从旁边绕道的法子，蜗牛已经把所有可能的方法都想过了。从枯叶上爬过去，一是花力气不说，关键是它担心那薄弱的枯叶能否承担它的体重，方才它用触角试探过了，只是轻轻碰一下，那枯叶都抖动个不停，这不能不令它担心。它因此下定决心，要从枯叶下方钻过去。这片叶子是拱起来的，那桥洞挺高，足够它钻过去了。它把头探了进去，在入口处观察着这个高大的棕色穹顶，棕光显得有些阴凉，它要先适应一下。这时候，草地外面又走过来两个人，一男一女，都很年轻，正是花样年华，或者说是花样年华即将到来的时期，青春洋溢，如同含苞欲放的花蕾，也如同已经长好翅膀却依然在阳光下一动不动的蝴蝶。

“今天不是周五，真是幸运啊！”男子说。

“为什么？你相信运气？”

“如果今天是星期五，你就要花六个便士了。”

“不就是六个便士嘛，难道你觉得它不值吗？”

“它是什么？你说的‘它’是指什么？”

“算了，我只是随口一说，我的意思是——你能明白的，对吗？”

他们的语气十分平淡，听不出半点抑扬顿挫的味道，每说完一句话都要沉默好半晌。他们静静地站在花坛边上，合力把遮阳伞的尖柄深深插进松软的泥土里。正如他们那简短而无意义的谈话表达出了某种东西一般，他们的动作，尤其是男子把手放在女子手上的举动，这种奇特的方式同样表达出了他们之间的情感。不过他们的语句实在太简短了，以至于话的短翼没办法承载起深沉的躯体，没办法将感情远远地传送出去，而是令它笨拙地跌落在身边一些毫无价值的东西上。然而，相比这对翅膀笨拙的触碰而言，这些东西太过沉重了。不过谁又知道呢（他们把伞的尖柄插入泥土里时这么想），或许在这些对话中隐藏着陡峭的悬崖也未可知，也或许冰寒的陡坡正在明媚的阳光下闪烁寒光。谁又清楚呢？这种状况以前从来没见过。或许，当她想要知道邱园能够供应什么样的茶水时，他也会琢磨她的话里面有没有悄悄隐藏着什么，是否有某个坚硬、巨大的东西屹立在话后，迷雾悄然升起，显露出来——哦，上帝！那些斑斓驳杂的东西是什么呀？——小小的白桌旁，女侍看了看她，又看了看他，递上了账单。他需要付一枚两先令的硬币。这是真的，全都是真的，他的手在衣兜里摸索着硬币，他毫不怀疑，这对谁而言都不是虚假的，但他们却不在其中。最后连他也感觉到它的真实性了，然后他激动过度，站不稳了，不能思考了，把遮阳伞一把从地里拔出来，急切地想要找一个地方像别人一样跟其他人喝茶。

“特丽西，走吧，我们应该去喝点茶。”

“喝茶的人们在哪儿啊？”她问，她的声音颤抖着，显得异常激动，一双眼睛漫无目的地胡乱扫视，任由自己被拉着沿草径小路走着，阳伞拖在身后。

她一边跟着他走，一边四处扫视，至于喝茶一事早已忘得一干二净了。她想去的地方太多了，这儿，那儿，她想起了长在野花丛中的幽兰，仙鹤，中国的宝塔，以及一只红冠小鸟，但她依旧被他牵着往前走。

一对又一对的人们接连不断地从花坛旁经过，你看不到他们有什么目的明确的举止，总之都是那么洒脱自在。人们为一层层青色雾气所包围，最初还能看见他们身体的形状和颜色，但是后来连形状与颜色也被青蒙蒙的雾气所同化。太热了！如此闷热的天气里，连画眉鸟也待在花荫里不愿出来，每隔许久才机械地跳跃一下。四处嬉戏的白蝴蝶也不再远飞了，只会在同伴的上方翩翩起舞，微小的白点，相互交替着，立在最高的花朵上，那轮廓如同一根残破的大理石柱。棕榈房耀眼的玻璃屋顶，如一朵朵在闹市阳光下撑开的绿伞。夏天的晴空，在飞机的轰鸣中沉声说话，讲述着自身灵魂的暴躁。

突然间，黄色，黑色，粉色，白色，各种颜色，男人女人，老人孩子，统统出现在了天际，密匝匝，黑压压，他们摇摇欲坠，待看见草地上的一片金黄，立即飞扑到树荫下，就如颗颗水珠融化进了那团空气的黄与绿里，然后却又悄无声息地把空气染成了斑驳的红与蓝。炎热之中一个个沉重的身体动也不动地蜷曲在地上，可是他们发出的声音，颤巍巍地如同粗蜡燃烧时冒出的火焰。声音。没错，声音，沉默的声音。死寂被这种声音打破，被炽烈的欲望与深不见底的餍足打破，被孩童们的声音与令人战栗的清新打破。可实际并无寂静。公共汽车不断地变挡，车轮飞快转动，就如一个个钢铁锻造的巨大盒子，一个套着一个，发出嗡嗡噪声，不断地转动着。喧嚣的声音之上，无数的花瓣在空中绽放光彩。





琼·马丁小姐的日记


我的读者对我可能并不了解。因此，尽管这样的做法十分罕见且不太自然——众所周知，作家们都是极其谦逊的——我仍要毫不犹豫地自我介绍一番。我的名字叫罗莎蒙德·梅里丢，四十五岁——我一贯坦率！——我对中世纪英格兰土地所有制的研究使我在历史领域颇负盛名。柏林人对我的大名耳熟能详，法兰克福人抢着为我举办晚宴，牛津及剑桥两耳不闻窗外事的学者们对我的名声也并不陌生。考虑到人类的天性，为了让大家更加信服，或许，我应该这样来阐释我的成就：我舍弃了婚姻、家庭，以及能让我安度晚年的房子，只是为了把全部的时间都投入到泛黄的古代文献书稿中。这些古文稿没几个人能看得懂，看得懂的人也很少有愿意静下心来研究它们的。很多时候，我都怀着极度的好奇，去阅读其她女性同胞的著作，而面对这些枯燥乏味的文献时，我心中总是带着莫名的激动与喜爱。正如现实生活中母亲往往最疼爱她最丑最笨的孩子一样，它们在我心中就好比一个郁郁寡欢的跛子，但他的眼眸中却闪耀着睿智的光芒。我并不想对这句话做过多解释，因为它很难解释清楚，恰如打比方时说的那位母亲，纵使她做再多的努力，都几乎不可能让别人觉得她的丑儿子是一个英俊的小男孩儿，甚至俊过他所有的兄弟姐妹。

至少，我的调查研究把我变得像是一个四处游走的沿街叫卖的小贩，唯一不同的是，我所从事的是求购，而不是出售。我每到一个地方——如古老的乡下小院儿、颓败的庄园大宅、牧师住所、教堂的法器屋——都会问同一个问题：您这儿有什么古籍文献能让我瞧瞧吗？正如你能想象到的那样，时至今日，收购古籍越发不易了。稍微有点历史尘埃的玩意儿，人们就会削尖了脑袋一哄而上，最初的个人收购行为也被政府机构所取代。常有人告诉我，有政府官员承诺他们，说要过来看看他们的旧文稿。相比我微不足道的个人信誉，人们更加倾向于相信政府的承诺。

我倒也并无多少怨言，回想曾经，我也收集过一些能够引起历史学家兴致的珍贵史料。除此之外，一些资料偶尔带来的微小启迪，也足以使我兴致勃勃，乐此不疲。比如，一束出乎意料的光投射到伊丽莎白·帕特里奇夫人画像的腿上，照亮了整个英格兰，使王座上的国王得到了启示：她没有穿袜子！除了现实之外，这双中世纪的腿并没有给人留下其他深刻的印象；因此，关于中世纪身躯的现实，逐步地继续往上，关于中世纪头部的现实，最后你站在了所有年代的中心：要么从中间开始，要么在中间结束。另外，这使我的另一擅长方向也得以体现——我研究十二、十三、十四世纪的土地所有制之所以能获得不菲成果，多半要归功于我擅长将它们和当时人民的生活相互结合起来阐释。我始终牢记一点，男女老幼的生活最重要的方面并不能完全体现土地所有制的复杂性；我常常大胆暗示自己，那些使我们忍俊不禁的细节并不是因为他们令人称叹的细心，而恰恰是因为他们的马虎大意；我甚至敢不知天高地厚地质问：哪个疯子会为了自己死去五百年后才出生的文物研究者，而殚精竭虑地把制度复杂化？

这个话题我已经讨论过很多遍了，没必要再浪费口舌，之所以在这里提出它，仅仅是为了说明我为什么会紧抓那些描绘家庭生活的图片的细节——比如开在交错盘缠的根茎上的鲜花、燧石碰撞时迸发出的火花，并在我的文章中予以探讨。

不同性格的读者在阅读我的文章《庄园名册》时，有的会觉得我的那些题外话别有趣味，而有的则会觉得不知所谓。

我不在乎铺陈笔墨信手挥毫，就如作工笔画那样，将当时的生活场景的每一个细节都勾勒出来：我敲开农奴的门，发现他正在烤他偷猎来的野兔；或者，我也可以描述庄园主正准备外出远行，或叫上他的狗去田野散步，或坐在高背椅上，在光滑的羊皮纸上画某个干活儿的人。而在另一个房间，我也可以向你展示埃莉诺夫人正在缝补衣服，她的女儿坐在她旁边的一张矮凳子上也在缝衣服，不过没有她母亲那么认真，然后母亲就斥责女儿：“丫头呀，怕是等你丈夫来迎娶你的时候，你的嫁妆都还没有准备好啊。”

不过，您要是想看这些详细的描述，就只能去我的书里慢慢看了！评论家们往往喜欢从两个方面来批评我：首先，他们会说，虽然这些题外话也跟历史沾点边儿，但是跟中世纪的土地所有制八竿子打不着；接着他们会指责我，说我提供不了任何历史资料来证明我的论述与史实相符。众所周知，我探究的那个历史阶段，私人收藏的史料最为匮乏。除非你选择仅从帕斯顿的信函中汲取你全部的灵感，否则你将更愿意倚仗自己的想象，就像其他叙述者一样。他们会说：想象很有用，但历史是一门严谨的学术，容不得掺杂想象的成分。对此，我只能把我经常说的并在《历史学季刊》中论证过的那个观点搬出来再说一遍：我们的研究需要有创新，否则某些任性的读者会干脆把书丢掉，声称早就掌握了书本里的东西——唉，新坛装老醋！又是那些老学究们的争执！让我在此画上一条线——将所有似是而非、真假难辨的问题都抛在身后。

两年前的六月，某天早晨，我碰巧驾车沿着塞特福特路从诺里奇前往东哈灵。我正进行着一些探险——又是一次徒劳的考察——为了拿到一些我认为被埋藏在凯斯特大教堂的废墟里的资料。如果我们把每年花费在挖掘希腊古城上的钱拿出十分之一来挖掘国内的废墟遗址的话，英格兰的历史将全部被改写。

我在想这些的时候，正以考古的眼光扫视着汽车行进时掠过的那些景物。我是根据一份电报的指示跳上车来到这里的，途中我突然叫司机急转弯，向左行驶。汽车在林荫路上飞驰，路的两旁整齐地栽着古老的榆树，不过最吸引我的，是路的尽头，那条由古老的雕花白石砌成的门道，在绿荫的掩映下，宛如一幅小小的镶嵌在绿色边框中的正方形风景画。

当我们驶近，方发现门道的两侧是狭长的矮墙，墙面抹着淡黄色的灰泥，墙头不远处是铺着红瓦的屋顶，迎面耸立着一栋小房子，从外部看起来，就好像去掉中间一横的“E”字。

有一些简陋而小巧的老宅邸，几个世纪以来它们从未被改动过，简直默默无闻，因为他们太过无关紧要以至于无人愿意来修葺或拆除它们，而宅邸的主人又囊中羞涩没有这份闲心。那些建造者的后人们继续居住在这里，没有意识到这些房子的价值，他们仅如经过无数年烟熏火燎后被熏黑的烟囱一样，成为它的一部分。这栋房子就是这样的。当然，大一点的房子住起来会更舒服一些，我一点儿也不怀疑，如果有人愿意出高价买这栋老房子，他们肯定会毫不犹豫卖出去的。但正是这种顺其自然，无人装饰与修缮的风格才证明了房子最真实的一面被保存了下来。你很难对一栋居住了五百年的房子产生感动。我站在门前抬手按门铃的时候，心想：就是这样的地方，它们的主人才最有可能拥有完美无缺的手稿，而且还会像出售喂猪的泔水或猎园里的木头一样，不假思索地将它们卖给一个来收破烂的人。毕竟，我认为我对古文稿的痴迷是病态的怪人想法，而他们是真实健康的正常人。他们不会写字吗？他们会告诉我；旧书信能有什么价值呢？我总是烧掉我自己写的信——或者用来包酱罐。

终于，一个女用过来开了门，她煞有介事地打量着我，似乎想把我的容貌和职业牢牢记住。

“这里的主人是谁？”我问她。

“马丁先生。”她惊讶地张大了嘴，仿佛我问的问题是：现在的英格兰国王是谁？

“他有夫人吗？她在不在家？我能跟她谈谈吗？”

女用招招手，示意让我跟她走。她一声不吭，只是领着我往前，似乎我的问题古怪到令她无法回答，而只能带我到那个能回答的人那里去。

我们从一间镶着橡木护墙板的大厅里穿过去，来到一间比较小的房间里。我看到一位年龄与我差不多的妇女正在一台缝纫机上修理裤子，她的皮肤十分红润，看上去至少是个管家。不过，女用低声跟我说：“她是马丁夫人。”

她站起来的姿势就像在表明：她即便不是一位接受下午的正式拜访的贵妇人，但最起码她是这所房子权威的女主人，有权利知道我的来意。

古物收藏圈里有自己的一套潜规则，第一，也是最简单的一条——初次见面最忌讳直奔主题。“我碰巧经过您的门前，恕我冒犯——我必须告诉您，我极其热爱美景，希望能有机会参观您的府邸。在我看来，它实在是美不胜收。”

“我可否问下，您打算租下它吗？”马丁太太说，她的声音非常好听，略微带着一点地方口音。

我问道：“您有房间要出租吗？”

“哦，不是，”马丁太太果断摇头，“我们从来不出租房间，我是想，或许您有兴趣把它整栋租下来。”

“对我来说，它实在有些大——不过，我有些朋友也许有兴趣。”

“这样也可以。”马丁太太爽朗地说道。她把利益问题暂且搁在一边，打算先成全我的心愿，她说：“我很乐意带您在房子里随便瞧瞧——我对古物没多少了解，而且也并没有听说过这房子里有什么特别的东西。如果您是从伦敦来的——那它还真是一个挺不错的地方。”她带着一种好奇的目光，打量着我的身材和裙子。我在她好奇加关怀的目光下，感觉腰板也没有平时挺得那么直了。我满足了她的好奇。我们顺着一条长廊往前走，一间一间地参观那些小房间。走廊的墙壁刷着白色刷墙粉，还镶着橡木条，看起来十分养眼。每一个房间都打扫得干干净净，墙壁上有方方正正的窗户，可以看到花园里的勃勃绿荫，至于家具，只有疏疏落落那么几样东西，不过都很精致。

我们互问了对方一些问题，也回答了对方许多问题。她的丈夫算得上是一个农场主，不过现在的土地远不如以前值钱了。他们不得不住在这栋房子里，因为租不出去。尽管房子大得远超他们的需求，并且老鼠成灾。这栋房子由她丈夫的家族持有很多年了，她很自豪地告诉我。她不清楚具体有多少年，但人们说，马丁家族曾是这片区域的名门望族。她特意向我指出：马丁这个姓氏中间是“y”，而不是“i”。她带着一种历经沧桑的自豪感告诉我，她经历过太多艰难困苦，所以她完全明白他们这些贵族出身的人，而今因为土地的贬值和财务的窘困，所剩下的不过是一栋屋顶漏水的房子和一群群飞扬跋扈的老鼠。

尽管这个地方被打扫得一尘不染，且刻意细心地维护着，但所有的房间都显得太过空旷，大大的橡木桌十分显眼地摆在那里，只有几只白镴杯和瓷盘陪衬着，让人猛一看就会觉得很不舒服，就好像大部分容易被移动的小物件都被卖掉了一样。

我没有告诉这位女主人我觉得她的房子已经失去了它从前的光辉，怕伤了她的颜面，但却不禁觉得她向我展示这些几乎全空的房间的热情姿态，实际上是在拿今日的寒酸与往日的奢华作对比，就差直言不讳地说：“以前比现在要好得多。”

她领着我看了一整排卧室，其中有一两间用来做起居室真的很不错——假如主人有闲情逸致在里面静坐的话。我看到她脸上浮现出一丝歉疚的神色，大概她是想向我说明她自己也意识到了她那样的魁梧身材跟这样的房子严重不协调吧。

这所有的一切，都让我没心情再提出那个我最感兴趣的话题了——你们有没有旧书籍？我开始觉得已经耽误了这位热心肠的女主人太多的时间，是时候让她回到缝纫机那里继续她的工作了，恰好这时候窗户外传来一声口哨，她霍然朝窗外望去，喊着进来吃晚餐什么的。然后，她转身对着我时，略带羞赧地殷切邀请我“留下来”和他们“一起用餐”。

“我丈夫约翰对这些古物的了解远胜于我，并且我知道他十分乐意与人交谈，”她笑着说，“他天生如此，我跟他说过的。”

我实在找不出理由拒绝她的邀请。

约翰·马丁先生与他的妻子迥然不同，你很难说清楚他是一个什么样的人。他是一个身材匀称的中年人，发色近于黑色，肤色偏黑，但是对于一个农夫而言，又显得太过白净。他的嘴上留着两撇小胡子，说话的时候习惯用那双骨架匀称的手抚摸他的胡须。他有一双浅灰色眼睛，特别明亮，但每当我对上他的目光时，总觉得他看我的眼神中带着几分怀疑。后来他用比妻子还要明显的诺福克口音开始说话，跟他的着装一样，他的声音也说明，即便他的外貌可能不太像，但他确实是个诺福克的农场主。

当我跟他说他的妻子非常热心，带我参观了他们的房屋时，他只是点了点头，而后目光灼灼地看着她，说：“要是遵照她的意愿，我们是应该搬走把这里留给那些老鼠们居住的。这栋房子太空旷了，里面有不计其数的幽灵，是不是，贝蒂？”她只是微笑，大概那一场她参加过的争吵在很久以前就落幕了。

我为了博取他的好感，说了很多话来赞美这所房子，说它有多么漂亮，历史有多么悠久，但是他似乎一点都不在乎，一边大口嚼着冷牛肉，一边漫不经心地回应一声“是的”或“不是”。

在他头上方挂着一幅可能绘成于查理一世时期的画像，画中的人物看起来跟他非常相像，只是把他身上的翻领衬衫和花色呢绒外衣换成了皱领衬衫和真丝紧身上衣。我跟他说他们很像。

“哦，是的，”他说，看上去对此一点兴趣都没有，“那是我的曾祖父，也可能是高祖父，我们家的祖先太多了。”

“那位在伯聂参战的马丁先生是不是他？”贝蒂一边坚持让我再吃一块牛肉，一边随口问道。

“在伯聂？”她的丈夫大声说，语气带着质疑和恼怒，“噢，我的好夫人呀，你说的那位是贾斯珀叔叔。在伯聂战役还没发生的时候，画像里的那位就已作古了。他是威洛比。”他转过脸来看着我，格外认真地解说，对于这种大约没有人会感兴趣的事情，可能他觉得像这样的错误是不可原谅的，所以他希望我能详尽了解。

“威洛比·马丁，生于1625年，死于1685年；马斯顿荒原战役中，他担任诺福克郡骑兵连队长。我们家族向来都站在皇室这一边，护国公时期他被驱逐出境，流亡到阿姆斯特丹，在那里他从纽卡斯尔公爵手里买了一匹红鬃马，我们现在还有这匹马的后代呢。后来王政复辟时期他返回这里，与庄园主之女莎莉·汉普顿成婚，他们在我出生前就都死掉了。他们生了六个孩子——四男两女。他买了那块洼地牧场，你忘了吗，贝蒂？”他冲妻子扬了扬下巴，奚落她的记性太差。

“我现在记起来了。”她淡然地说。

“他死于天花，也可能是其他某种疾病，只是当时被人们叫作天花。他的晚年就是在这里度过的。他还把这种病传染给了他的女儿琼，最后两人一同被葬在了那边的教堂里。”他翘起大拇指指了指，继续吃他的晚餐。他三言两语自顾自地介绍完这些，就像这是他必须执行的职责一样。这么多年以来，他对这些人物以及他们的故事已经非常熟悉了，甚至熟悉到了一种厌烦的地步，却不得不又重复一次。

我也不得不再次表示对这个故事很感兴趣，虽然我知道我的表现对取悦这位男主人毫无帮助。

以至于后来他的脸上都带上了愠色，用一种幽默的语气掩饰自己的不快：“您对我的祖先们好像有着超出人之常情的兴趣啊。”

“约翰，等用完晚餐后，你一定要带着这位小姐去看看那些画像，还有所有的那些古董。”他的妻子这时插话说。

“我真的很感兴趣，”我说，“但我不能再打扰你们了。”

“约翰对它们了解很多，他真的学习了很多和那些画像有关的知识。”

她的丈夫很是不满，低声说道：“就算是白痴也了解自己的祖先，贝蒂。不过，这位女士，要是您愿意参观下我们的这些画像，我倒是乐意奉陪。”他说话很有技巧，而后打开门，极有绅士风度地让我先走，这让我想起了他姓氏中间的字母“y”。

他带着我将整座宅邸都逛了一遍，用手里的短马鞭指着经过的每一幅黯淡的油画，并用简短的几个词汇略加描述一番。这些挂在墙壁上的画，统统是按照时间顺序来排列的。即便是厚厚的灰尘，也无法掩盖一个事实，那就是后期作品的艺术价值远比不上早期作品，而且画像中的人物，也远没有早期的卓越。军装出现的次数越来越少，十八世纪的马丁先生们，几乎清一色地穿着做工粗糙的黄褐色外套，马丁先生简短地用“农场主”“那个把水田卖掉的人”这样的词汇来解说他们。后期的画像中，他们的妻子和女儿们干脆就不再出现了，好像画像逐渐被当作了一种属于一家之主的不可或缺的陪衬，而不是对美好事物的描绘了。

但是，他的声音中既没有自豪，也没有任何失落，以至于我无法从中捕捉到任何信号以证明他正一边用短马鞭指着画像，一边追忆着这个家族的兴衰荣辱。大概，他已经将这个故事讲了太多遍吧，以至于连那些词汇都失去了自身的褒贬色彩。

“这是最后一幅画像——我的父亲。”他带着我不紧不慢地将整个宅邸的边边角角都兜了一遍，最后说道。我看了看这幅粗糙的帆布画，猜测它大概绘成于六十年代早期，工笔并不讲究，很可能是一个流浪画家画的。可能是画匠的手法不够娴熟，画像上的人物脸部特征显得不够饱满，肤色也不够匀称，活脱脱就是一个农夫形象，儿子身上的绅士风采与野性风采，在父亲的这幅画像上丝毫没有体现出来。这位画家把被画者塞进黑色的外套里，拿一条僵直的白色领带狠狠勒在他的脖子上，那位可怜的绅士大概从始至终也没有自在过吧。

我觉得自己真的应该说些感谢的话：“马丁先生，我不知该怎样感谢您和您的妻子——”

“不急。”他打断我，说，“还没完呢，还有一些书籍。”

他的语气颇为强硬，让我觉得有点滑稽，显然他对自己现在的所作所为毫无兴致，但是他又坚持要进行到底。

他推开一扇门，让我进入了一间小屋，或者不如说是办公室。桌子上摞着厚厚的文件，墙根处放着账簿，这间屋子应该是地产主人进行交易的地方。屋子里有拍纸簿、画笔等一类装饰品，靠墙的架子上和壁柜中有许多死去的动物，他们举着全无生气的爪子，张开的嘴里露出石膏舌头。

“这些东西的年代比画像还要久远。”他弯下腰，费力地将一大包泛黄的纸张拎起来。它们没有被装订，也没有作任何方式联络，只是简单地用一根两端带有小棍儿的绿色粗线绳扎起来，就像你用来穿透一些油腻文件的小棍儿——如肉贩的账单、当年的收据等。他说：“这是最早的一批。”他用手指划拉着纸张的边缘，就好像划拉一副扑克牌一样，“这是最早的，1480年到1500年的。”

正如任何人都会做出的反应那样，我倒吸了一口冷气，但是马丁先生冷漠的语气提醒着我，热情与这里格格不入。的确，与这些真迹相比，热情简直就像一个十分廉价的商品。

“噢！确实很有意思，我可以看一看吗？”我只说了一句，可是，当马丁先生随意地拿起它，放进我的手里时，尽管我竭力地控制自己，我的双手还是微微颤抖了起来。马丁先生说要去把掸子取来，免得我沾上纸上的灰尘，但是我向他保证，沾上也不要紧。我担心他出于某些更实质的原因而不想让我碰这些珍贵无比的纸卷，所以语气不由自主地急迫起来。

他在书柜前弯下腰的时候，我迫不及待地扫了一眼第一页羊皮纸上的题词——

“琼·马丁小姐的日记，”我一字一字地念了出来。“公历1480年，由她本人于诺福克郡马丁大宅记述。”

“是我姑祖母琼的日记，”马丁先生打断我，他转过身来，臂弯里抱着厚厚一摞书。“这个老太太肯定脾气很怪。我也经常尝试写日记，但是总是坚持不下来，最长的一次只写到了二月十日。可是你看这儿，”他凑过来，翻动着纸页，用手指指着它说，“这是一月、二月、三月、四月——往后还有——整整十二个月。”

“那您读过它们吗？”我问。

我估计——不，是我希望——他说没有。

“嗯，是的，我读过。”他漫不经心地说，仿佛那根本就是一件不值一提的小事，“为了习惯她的行文我花了不少时间，她拼写得太古怪了，另外，里面记录的东西也让人摸不着头脑。”他边想边道，“不管怎么说，我至少从她的日记里知道了很多关于土地的事情。”

我问他：“那您对她的生平也有所了解啰？”

“琼·马丁，”他用一种主持人的语调说道，“生于1495年[1]。父亲贾尔斯·马丁。她是他唯一的女儿，他还有三个儿子——我们总是生儿子。她二十五岁的时候开始写这本日记，她一生都住在这里——终身未嫁。实际上，她在三十岁的时候就去世了。你在那边能看到她的墓，当然，其他所有人的墓也都在那儿。”

“现在看这个，”他用手指了指一本用羊皮纸装订的厚书，“我觉得这个更有趣。这是贾斯珀1583年的家宅手册，通过这套册子你可以了解这位老先生是怎么记账的，他们的饮食有些什么，肉类、面包和酒水当时卖多少钱，他有多少个仆人、多少马匹、马车、家具、床等等，你想了解的一切都可以从这里找到。我有一整套十本。”他谈论这些的时候，语气中流露出一股不易觉察的自豪，这是我在之前听他谈论其他财产时所感觉不到的。

“在冷寂的冬夜里，阅读这些材料无疑是个不错的选择。”他又说道：“这是威洛比的良种马登记册。你应该记得威洛比吧。”

“他是从纽卡斯尔公爵手里买下那匹马，死于天花的那位。”我毫不含糊地复述道。

“没错，”他点了点头，“这本书可是件宝贝。”他继续说道，像一位鉴赏家，正在评论自己最喜爱的牌子的波特酒，“给我二十英镑我也绝不会卖的。它如圣经一样详细记录着它们的名字、血统、品相、功绩以及后代。”他舌头上下翻动，念叨着那些早已死去的马的稀奇古怪的名字，就像是在品味红酒一般，他笑道：“我可以不看书就把它们的名字一一背出来，不信的话问问我妻子。”他极为小心地把那本书合上，放回书架上。

“这些是记载庄园的册子，一直记到了今年，这是最后一本。这是我们家族的族谱。”他打开一卷长长的羊皮纸，上面画着繁杂的族谱树，一些书写于中世纪的花体字都已经褪色了。从庞大而交错纵横的枝蔓上可看出，这个家族的确人丁兴旺，有些人甚至因为纸张篇幅的原因而未能记录于上。比如，有个人养了十个孩子，最后只得舍掉他妻子的名字。在纸张的最下面，有几行新的墨迹，正是招待我的主人贾斯珀·马丁，和他的妻子伊丽莎白·克莱，以及他们三个儿子的名字。他的手指由上而下顺着族谱树飞快滑动，似乎这根手指已经驾轻就熟了，他绝对相信它能自行完成任务。他轻声念着一个个名字，如同祈祷者一遍遍吟诵着圣徒名录和他们的种种事迹一样。

“嗯，”他把羊皮纸卷起来放好，做总结似的说，“我觉得我最喜欢的就是这两本，无论是马匹的名字，还是我祖先的名字，我都能闭着眼睛一一把它们说出来！”

“那您一定经常在这儿研究啰？”我问道，这个奇怪的男人让我有些困惑。

“我没有时间研究。”他粗声粗气地回答道，就像是我的问题突然把他隐藏的农夫本性给激发出来了一样，“我喜欢在冬夜里读一些不太难懂的书；要是早晨醒得早，我也会看上一会儿。有时候，我还会把它们放在枕头边儿上，用来催眠。至于自己家族的那些人名，你什么都不用做，自然而然就记住了。我向来不擅长读书，这是我的一大遗憾。”

他在征得我的同意后，点着烟斗，抽起了烟，他一边吞云吐雾一边整理面前的卷册。我将那卷最古老的文件，那一小卷羊皮纸，留在手中，不过他好像并不在乎。

“我猜，要是跟这些分开，您会觉得难过吧？”我旁敲侧击地问他，并以干笑来掩饰自己的急迫心情。

“跟它们分开？”他反问道，“为什么要跟它们分开？”可见他从来就没想过要卖掉它们，因此我的试探也没有像我担心的那样引起他的疑心。

“不会，绝对不会，”他继续说道，“对我来说，把它们换成钞票远不如留着它们对我有用。当初正是这些旧资料在法庭上证明了我的权利。况且，我希望我的家人们与我同在，要是没有这些祖父、祖母、叔叔、姑母的名字陪着我，我一定会非常孤独的。您能明白我的意思吗？”他似乎是在坦诚自己的缺点一样。

“当然，”我说道，“我非常理解——”

“依我看，像您这样的女士，如果一个人生活在这样的地方，也会有同感吧？别人的陪伴是一种不可思议的力量，它的重要性无与伦比。我都不敢想象，要是没有这些亲戚们的陪伴，我该如何打发时间。”

无论是用我的文字描述，还是通过记录他的话语，都无法再现他说话时所产生的奇怪印象，就像所有的这些亲戚们，伊丽莎白时期的祖父们，不，应该是爱德华四世时期的祖母们都正在——或许可以这样说——正在墙角沉思不语。他的语气并没有因为有这些先祖而自豪，那只是一种孩子对待父母似的赤诚之爱。他的脑海中有一束明亮的光静静照耀着每一代先辈，那束光不一定今日才有，但也绝不是我们通常所以为的诞生于过去。它有的只是清晰、寥廓，不掺杂一丝浪漫。故人在光的照耀下，清晰地显现出来，让我恍然以为曾经的他们又活灵活现地站在了我的面前。

无需刻意，便可轻易想象得到，贾斯珀·马丁从农场回到家里，随时都能走进这间房子，一个人坐在那里，和他的“亲人们”轻松惬意地畅叙一番。他们的谈话一定是轻声细语的，就像从敞开的窗户里飘进来的在楼下田野间沐浴着午后斜阳劳作的农民们的说话声。

当我想起最开始打算问他愿不愿意卖掉这些书册的企图时，不禁脸红了。这样的企图无疑是非常无礼，且不恰当的。而且，虽然听起来很不可思议，不过这时的我真的没有了那种古物收藏家的热切。所有我对于古物和历史印记的热情都离我而去，我现在只觉得它们都已无足轻重了，不过是真正重要的事物在因缘际会下的副产品罢了。面对马丁先生的先人们，古物研究者的智慧根本无法解读他们，而马丁先生家族的历史也完全不需要这些研究者们跑来多事。

他会告诉我，他们还活着，跟你并无不同。他们已经逝去四五个世纪的事实并不能对他们产生影响，就如你放在画布上的玻璃并不会掩盖下面的图画。

但换句话说，当我自知提出买书很是失礼时，自然而然的，就想到了跟他借书——或许是我头脑太过简单了。

“唔……马丁先生，”最后，我语气平缓，无一丝局促感地说——连我自己都敢不相信在这种情况下我能做到如此，“我想我会在离这儿不远处——就是那家加瑟姆的天鹅旅馆住上一周的时间，如果您不介意的话，我想在这段时间里借阅一下您的这些史料，对于您的慷慨我将感激不尽。这是我的名片。您要是质疑我的身份，莱索姆先生（当地的一名庄园主）可以为我作证。”直觉告诉我马丁先生并不是那种好说话的人。

谁知他轻描淡写地说：“哦，女士，没这个必要。”

听起来，就好像我的这种要求根本算不了什么，他完全不需要细查考虑一番。他说：“如果您对这些资料感兴趣，欢迎您随时来借阅。”不过，他表现出了一种诧异，所以我补充道：“我对家族史有着浓厚的兴趣，就算不是我家的也一样。”

他十分礼貌地表示了认同，说：“如果您愿意花时间，我想，它们会给您带来乐趣的。”

不过我觉得，他对我的才学并不是很看好。

“您想借哪一本？”他问我，一边伸出手去，把贾斯珀的家宅手册和威洛比的良种马记录册拿了起来。

“这个，我想先拜读一下您姑祖母琼的，”我说道，“我喜欢从第一本开始读。”

“哦，好的，”他笑道，“虽然我不认为您会发现她有什么特别之处，她跟我们所有人一样，本来就没有什么了不起的地方……”

不过最终我还是带着他姑祖母琼的日记离开了。他们本打算让小信差骑自行车把它给我送过去，不过我拒绝了。但这一个大包看上去有些不伦不类，所以在贝蒂的坚持下，就用牛皮纸把它包了起来。





（一）


母亲告诉我，这个时代的状况，远不如她儿时那么安全和幸福了，因此我们必须待在家族的领地里。天黑以后——一月份的天总是早早地就黑了——为了安全，我们不能踏出大厅的门半步。等天彻底黑下来，母亲没办法继续做针线活儿的时候，她就会手里拿着一大串钥匙走出去。“还有谁没回屋子吗？”她大喊道，摇响路旁的铃铛，以免还有人在田间劳作。然后她就会关上大门，将它锁好，把我们与外面的世界彻底隔离。

当月亮升起，照得结霜的大地一片白亮时，我常常会变得十分大胆，且心生躁动。我觉得自己感觉到了一切美丽自由的地方——整个英格兰，大海以及大海另一边的陆地——传来的压力，它就像潮水一样席卷而来，冲击着我们的铁门，在漫长的黑夜里，一波接一波，一浪接一浪，不知疲倦。有一次我甚至从床上跳起，冲进母亲的房间里，哭喊道：“让他们进来。让他们进来！我们要饿死了！”“是士兵来了吗？”母亲大声问道，“还是你父亲的声音？”她跑到窗前，我们一起凝视着窗外泛着银光的田野，那里一片宁和。但我没办法解释我听到了什么，母亲命令我回去睡觉，并为有一扇结实的大门能将我和外面的世界隔开而庆幸不已。

不过在狂风四起、乌云闭月的夜晚，我却乐意坐在火炉旁，觉得在这个时刻，那些蹑手蹑脚行走在路上或潜藏在树林里的坏人们即便拼尽全力也无法冲破我们坚实的大门。昨天晚上就是这样一个夜晚。他们常常在冬天的时候跑来，这时候父亲身在伦敦，我其他的兄弟——除了弟弟杰里米外——都在部队里，母亲不得不管理农场，指挥人们，以保障我们衣食无忧。教堂的钟响过八次以后，我们就不能再点蜡烛了，于是，神父约翰·桑兹以及一两个跟我们一起住在大宅子里的仆人就会陪着我们围坐在火焰腾腾的火堆边，我那总是不让自己闲下来的母亲，连这点火光也要利用起来，坐在壁炉旁边被火光照得通红的大木椅上绕着毛线来织毛衣。每当她的毛线绕好时，她就拿起大铁棍使劲地捅壁炉里的木头，火星溅起，火头蹿得更高了些。她将脸颊凑近昏暗的火光时，你依旧会觉得她是一位真正的贵妇人。尽管母亲才四十多岁，可操劳和忧虑已让她的额头上布满了深深的皱痕，她戴着一顶细亚麻布料做的帽子，帽子的形状非常贴合她的头型。她的眼睛深邃而又坚定，她那红彤彤的脸颊就像冬日里储存良好的红苹果一样。能作为这样一个女人的女儿是一件了不起的事情，并且我希望有一天能拥有和她同样的能力——她管理着我们所有人。

尽管约翰·桑兹爵士是一位神父，从事的是神职工作，但他同时也是母亲的仆从，对母亲的吩咐总是不断抱怨却又一一执行，尤其是当她询问他的意见却又独断专行的时候。可每当我对此有所不满的时候，母亲就会严厉地批评我，她视自己为教会的女儿，忠诚于教会，并尊敬她的神父。

再来就是威廉和安妮，和我们一起坐在炉火边的仆人，因为他们都上了年岁，所以母亲希望他们同我们一起坐着烤火，但威廉的岁数实在太大了，而且由于多年在田间劳作，日晒风吹的关系，他的脊背已经佝偻，皮肤也布满黑斑，粗糙不堪。实际上他与我们一起烤火闲聊，还不如长在湿地的一棵垂柳说的话多。不过，他有时会尽可能地回忆一些很久以前的故事讲给我们听，尤其是他年轻时候的见闻，这倒是让我很感兴趣。

老安妮过去是母亲的保姆，后来又做过我的保姆，直到现在她还在给我们缝补衣服。除了母亲以外，她是家里最擅长家务事的人。哪怕是家里的一把椅子，一张桌子或一条挂毯，她都能讲出它们的故事来。她最喜欢与母亲和约翰爵士谈论的话题，就是我最适合嫁给什么样的男人。

要是光线允许的话，我就必须大声朗读——因为这里只有我能读书，尽管母亲会拼写单词，这已经领先于她那个年代的女孩。父亲从伦敦寄回来一份书稿，书名叫《玻璃宫殿》，由约翰·利德盖特创作，是一部关于海伦和特洛伊战争的诗。

昨天晚上，我为他们读着诗人笔下的海伦，她是那么美丽，有那么多的追求者，他们都一声不响地听着，然后我又讲到特洛伊城如何牢不可破，易守难攻——虽然我们都不知道那些地方在世界的哪一端，但是它们却在我们的想象中栩栩如生。当讲到战士们遭受磨难时，我们会一起流泪。在想象海伦是多么的高贵时，我觉得，她一定在某些方面和我的母亲相似。我讲到她的时候，母亲就会用一只脚轻叩出节拍，从她那双明亮无比的眼睛和跟着诗的节奏快慢有致地点着的头，我知道，她是在想象队伍行进。“那肯定是跟康沃尔[2]一样的地方，”约翰爵士说，“亚瑟王和他的骑士们守护在那里。他们的故事我全都知道，他们做过的所有事情我都能讲给你们听，可惜我有点记不大清了。”

“噢，还有北欧英雄们的故事！”这时安妮插话说，她的母亲就来自北欧，“我常常把他们的故事唱给主人和琼小姐听呢。”

“琼，继续往下读，趁着火光还亮。”母亲催促我，我觉得，她是所有人中听得最认真的一个。当不远处的教堂响起宵禁的钟声时，她也是最为懊恼的，她说自己还要给远在伦敦的父亲记账呢，现在却浪费时间听故事，真是老糊涂了。

火光渐弱，我终于看不清文字了，朗读没办法再继续下去，接下来他们便开始谈论国家局势，讲述那些在离我们不远的地方发生的阴谋、战争和血腥事件。我觉得今时与古时相比并没有什么不同，无论是生活在海伦的时代，还是生活在我们所生活的这个诺福克时代，结果都是一样的。比如说去年，简·莫里森不就在新婚之夜被人抢走了吗？

不过，海伦的故事终究是太过久远了。在我母亲还是小姑娘的时候它就很久远了。可是那些烧杀劫掠的事件直到现在也还在继续。因此当他们谈论这些的时候，我和杰里米就会浑身颤抖，只要大门稍微发出一点响动，我们就会觉得是亡命的匪徒们在撞门。

更糟的是，我们不得不睡觉了。这时壁炉里的火已经熄灭了，我们需要摸索着走上楼梯，借助从走道窗户硬挤进来的一丁点微末光亮，穿过楼道走进冷森森的卧室。我房间里的窗户破了，弄了点稻草来勉强挡风，可风还是会吹进来。每当墙上的挂毯被风撩起来时，我就会想象有一群穿盔戴甲的人骑马向我冲来。昨夜，我向上帝祈祷，祈祷我们的大门牢不可破，祈祷所有的盗匪和杀人犯都只是路过。





（二）


拂晓，即便冷得让人无精打采，也一定会像泛着幽光的尖锐冰箭一般，刺穿我的四肢。我拉开厚重的幔子，寻找天空中的第一缕阳光，那是冲破禁锢的生命。我把脸贴在玻璃窗上，想象着我正在最大限度地贴近时间的壁垒，它不停地吊举和拉伸，为我们让出新的生存空间。我要细细地品味这一刻，在它洒向世界的其他地方之前！让我品味这最新鲜的时刻！我透过玻璃窗看着教堂的庭院，我的祖先们都埋葬在那里。我深深地同情着这些永远落入古老时间长河的死去的可怜人。我看见他们永恒地随着黯淡的浪潮不断地翻滚。让我们这些幸运拥有现在的人好好享受它、不要辜负它——这便是每日清晨我所祈祷的内容。

雨一直下个不停，所以我一早上都只能做些针线活儿。母亲正在给父亲写信，约翰·阿什下礼拜要去伦敦，正好把信捎过去。我的思绪自然而然地飘到了这次旅行上，飘到了那座伟大的城市上。我曾无数次梦想能去一趟伦敦，可是估计这个梦想永远也无法实现了吧。这一路上要花上好几天时间，所以必须一大早就出发。约翰同其他三个也要去伦敦的人结伴而行。我许多次看见他们启程，我是多么渴望能骑在马背上同他们一块儿出发。他们在院里集合时，天上的星星还在眨眼呢。附近的人们也赶来了，他们穿着奇怪的外套，披着斗篷。母亲为他们送行，为每一个出发的人斟了一大杯烈酒。马匹前后绑了许多包裹，不过，当他们需要策马疾驰时，也并不会受到影响。他们都装备了精良的武器，紧身骑服里面都穿着毛皮内衬，因为冬天白昼太短，格外寒冷，而且有可能露宿在树篱下。这是清晨庄重的一幕。马儿都不耐烦地踏着地，想要快点出发。人们围在一起，向上帝祈祷，祈求他们一路平安，并且顺利把信带给伦敦的亲人和朋友。当钟声敲响四下，他们转过身来，向母亲和其他人行礼道别，而后转身上路。一大群年轻的男男女女跟随在他们后面，为他们送行，直到晨雾遮住了他们的视线。因为，以往那些凌晨出发的男人们，有许多人再也没有回来。

我想象着他们整日奔走在白色的大道上，而后在圣母玛利亚的雕像前下马、礼拜，祈求她保佑此行顺遂。去伦敦的路只有一条，将要穿行一片无垠的荒地，那里没有人烟，只有劫掠者和杀人犯出没。由于这些人无法和其他人一起居住在城镇里，所以只能与野兽待在一起。而那些野兽也是会吃人的，它们会冷不丁从背后冒出来袭击人们。这是一段充满艰险的旅途，但说实话，我很想走上一遭，就像泛舟出海那样，从那片土地上穿行过去。

中午的时候，他们在一家小旅馆歇脚——去往伦敦的路上遍布着许多小旅馆，为旅客们提供一个安全的休息地。店老板将会告诉你道路的情况，他们也会询问你来时的经历，然后再提醒其他即将路经那里的人。但你必须继续前行，为了尽快赶到过夜的地方，要不然天一黑，那些白日里躲起来的野兽就会出动了。约翰常常跟我说，天黑以后人们就会把枪拿在手里，谁也不会说话，连那些马匹也会高竖起耳朵，加快步伐，根本不需要人来催促。等到达山顶后，要谨慎仔细地查看下方的动静了，以防那些躲藏在路边或冷杉丛里的野兽。这时候精神头十足的磨坊主罗宾就会唱上一曲，然后他们就会鼓足勇气，一边勇敢地骑向山下，一边高谈阔论。不然那呼呼的风声就像是女人发出的叹息声一样，会让他们毛骨悚然。有人踩着马镫立起身来，瞭望远方亮着灯火的小旅馆。如果圣母玛利亚保佑，我们在家中跪地祈祷的时候，他们就能安全到达目的地了。





（三）


今早，我正在看书的时候，母亲叫我去她房间，说有话要跟我谈。我在那间小屋子里找到了她。父亲在家的时候总是坐在这里，面前摆放着庄园名册和其他法律文书。当母亲代替父亲管理家业时，她也坐在这里。我恭恭敬敬地行礼，大概已猜到了她派人来叫我的原因。

她的前面放着一张纸，上面写满了蝇头小字。她叫我读一下，可是正当我要拿起来的时候，她又抢着说：“算了——我还是亲口告诉你吧。”

“女儿，”她开始说，带着一脸的严肃，“你必须成婚了。要不是国家太乱，”——她叹了口气——“我们自己也乱糟糟的，也不至于将这个问题搁置这么长时间。”

她面露微笑，看着我问：“你有没有想过结婚？”

“我舍不得离开你。”我说。

“你这孩子，还是没有长大呀。”她笑着说，我想，我的不舍多少也让她感到一些满足吧。

“但是，如果你嫁给我希望你嫁的人，”她在那张纸上拍了拍，“你是不会离我太远的。比如，你可以管理柯福林斯庄园——你的土地将与我们的毗邻——你将成为我们的好邻居。艾米亚斯·毕戈德爵士就是柯福林斯的领主，他的家族历史久远。”

“我觉得这桩婚姻挺合适的，所有的母亲都希望自己的女儿能嫁入这样的人家。”她沉思着说，那张纸一直在她的面前展开着。

我只见过一次艾米亚斯爵士，当时他跟我父亲一起参加完诺里奇会议后，来我家做客。不过我跟他的交流，仅限于庄重地向他敬上我斟的萨克酒，并行屈膝礼。所以我没办法谎称我对他的了解胜过她所说的这些。他皮肤白皙，一脸严肃的样子，头发略显灰白，不过没有我父亲的那么白，我知道的仅此而已。他的土地跟我们家的毗邻，我们有望幸福地生活在一起。

“婚姻，我的女儿，你必须知道，”母亲又说道，“既代表至高荣耀，又意味着最沉重的负担。你若跟艾米亚斯这样的人成婚，你不仅将领导他的家庭——那包括很多人，还将永远成为他的氏族的首领——那包括更多人。我们不会谈论爱情——如你的那位诗人所描述的炽烈、澎湃、疯狂的爱情。”

“哎呀，妈妈，他就是个会讲故事的人而已。”我插话说。

“那些东西，我们无法在真实生活中找到它们，最起码我认为很罕见。”母亲说话的时候总是伴随着沉思。

“不过，这些话题跟我们关系不大，我的女儿，”她说，并把那张纸抚得更加平整，“这是艾米亚斯爵士写给你父亲的信。他想向你求婚，他在信里询问你是否已有婚配，另外他还问我们会给你准备什么样的嫁妆。又说了他那边会拿什么当聘礼。我现在把信交给你，你自己读一读吧，琢磨琢磨，这桩交易是不是有利于你。”

我的嫁妆有多少钱，有多少土地，我都已知晓。我还知道身为父亲唯一的女儿，我的嫁妆肯定不会太寒酸。

为了这块我深爱着的土地，为了不至于离开母亲太远，我可以接受在财产与土地上不如我的人。可是——

可是当母亲把这封信放在我手里的时候，我的心居然是那么的压抑，就好像一下子大了好几岁。打小我就经常听到父亲和母亲谈论我的婚事，近几年来，他们有好几次差点就为我订婚了，不过最后都不了了之。我的年龄确实到了必须订立婚约的地步了。

自然，我考虑着母亲关于“婚姻是荣耀和负担”的说法，想了很久，直到中午用餐铃摇响。这是女人一生中无可比拟的重大转折。女人住在父亲家时，她总是被忽视，就如影子那样。可如果她幸运地嫁个好丈夫的话，婚姻就会赋予她实体，她会因此得到人们的重视，人们会关注她，为她让路。所以，每一个女孩子都会在茫然和忐忑中，期待这个转变的来临。因为这意味着：即刻起她将成为一名像我母亲那样的贵妇人，受到人们的尊敬，或者变得更加没有地位，更加没有价值——无论是生前，还是死后。

嫁得好，我就能执掌一个强大家族以及大量的土地；我就能拥有许许多多的仆人，做他们的女主人；我还会养育自己的儿子；丈夫不在家的时候，他的仆从、牛羊和庄稼，我都要代为管理，还要防备他的仇敌；我需要在家里存储细亚麻布，将调味品和果酱装满橱柜；我需要缝补破了的旧衣服，缝制新衣服，而待我离世时，我的女儿会在壁橱里看到比我出嫁时多很多倍的漂亮衣服；在我去世后的整整三天里，四方乡邻会纷纷赶来送我最后一程，为我祈福，为我朗读颂词，我的儿女们还会吩咐神父举行弥撒，好让我的灵魂得以升上天堂，而教堂里的蜡烛将永远为我燃烧。

我的思绪被用餐的铃声打断了。你不能迟到，否则你将会错过约翰爵士的感恩祷告，那意味着你将吃不到布丁。虽然饭后我还想继续想象女人结婚以后的生活状态，但是我的弟弟杰里米非要坚持和安东尼一起出去散步。安东尼是最受父亲器重的管家——仅次于我的母亲。

他虽然有些笨拙，但我挺喜欢他，因为他是个忠诚的仆人，对土地和羊群的了解胜过诺福克的任何人。去年的圣米迦勒节，兰瑟鲁特因为对母亲说话不敬，安东尼就把他的头给打破了。他大部分的时间都在田间巡视，我曾经跟他说，他是所有人中最热爱、最了解我们这片土地的人。他对这片土地的感情，就像是一个普通男子对待自己的爱人一样，觉得它是世间最美的。

我们不允许单独到外面散步，只能在他的陪同下在农田里走一走，他的热情也感染了我们。诺福克以及诺福克的朗文顿教区于我而言就像是我的祖母一样，她是一位温和的母亲，高贵、恬静、令人觉得亲切，我最终还是要回到她的身边。唉，要是能永远活在孩提时代，永远不用嫁人，一直保持着那份天真纯朴该多好！这世上有太多的烦恼，唯有这里的流水和绿荫能令我暂得清逸，重拾童真。婚姻和其他任何癫狂的喜悦，都会让我失去现在的清醒。我只要一想到即将失去它，就会在心中哭喊：“不，我永远不要为了丈夫或情人失去你！”接着，我立即跟杰里米和他的狗一起穿过石楠树丛追逐野兔。

明朗的午后，天气干冷干冷的，太阳不再是火焰，而是闪烁着寒光的冰块，阳光如同一条条长长的冰锥从天空射向地面，刺进我们的脸颊，撞碎在湿地上。整片田野上只有几只敏捷的野兔，除此之外，空无一物，但着实简单实在，安静幽雅，令人愉快。我们跑了起来，好让身体暖和一些，等到血液在四肢快速流窜时，我们开始闲聊。安东尼大步流星地走着，似乎他的步伐是世界上最有效的御寒武器。当然，当我们遇到有缺口的树篱笆，或者支开捕捉野兔的捕兽夹时，他就摘掉手套，单膝跪在那里认真地琢磨，就好像现在还是仲夏时分似的。一次，我们遇上一个低着脑袋走路的陌生人，他穿着一身铜绿色衣服，看他的神色，好像是迷路了一般。但是安东尼拽住我的手，告诉我说，这个人是躲藏在避难所里的罪犯，偷偷跑出来找食物的。或许他杀了人，或许抢了别人财物，也或许是欠了别人的钱。杰里米发誓他看见了那个人手上的血，不过他是个小男子汉，会用弓箭保护我们所有人。

安东尼有点事情要到一间棚屋去，我们想暖暖身子，就跟着他一起走了进去。可是，我实在受不了里头的热气和那股怪味。比阿特丽斯·萨默斯和她的丈夫彼得住在这里，他们有孩子。但它看起来根本不像是人住的屋子，而像是栖身在荒郊野岭的野兔们的洞窟。整个屋顶都是用树枝和稻草勉强搭起来的，地上也没有地砖，只有踏没了花草的泥土。树枝在角落里燃烧，散发的黑烟熏刺着我们的眼睛。一个女人坐在屋里唯一的一个烂木头墩上，正在给孩子喂奶。她看着我们，眼中没有一丝畏惧，只有显而易见的怀疑和反感。她将怀中的孩子抱得更紧了些。安东尼冲她说话的时候，就好像冲着某种长着尖利爪牙和凶狠眼睛的野兽一样，他居高临下，仿佛他的大靴子随时都会把她踩个稀巴烂。但她既没有移动分毫，也未曾开口说话。我甚至怀疑她会不会说话，抑或她的语言仅有嘶吼或咆哮。

我们在屋外碰见了彼得，他刚从湿地回来，他把手举到额头向我们行礼，然而我看不出他有哪一点比他的妻子更有人样。他似乎被我的彩色斗篷吸引住了，盯着我看了半晌，然后一瘸一拐地走进他的棚屋，在铺着干凤尾草的地上躺下——这是我猜的——一直睡到第二天天亮。

我们一定要把这些人踩在脚下，管束着他们，必须逼迫他们去干他们唯一该干的事情，要不然他们就会露出锋利的牙齿，把我们撕成碎片。安东尼带着我们离开那里的时候，这样告诉我们，他说话的时候，拳头是紧紧攥着的，嘴唇也绷得很紧，像是刚刚把某个混蛋打得趴在了地上。

然而，因为那张又丑又凶的脸，接下来的散步都俨然失去了兴味。看起来，即便是在我这片亲切的乡土上也有这样的害虫。我甚至感觉，那样的眼睛正躲在金雀花和杂乱的灌木丛中，死死地盯着我。

当回到整洁的大厅，看到那火苗旺盛的带着大烟囱的壁炉，看到那光洁耀眼的橡木家具时，我们就好像刚刚从一场噩梦中苏醒过来一样。母亲从楼梯上走下来，穿着一身华美的长袍，带着洁白胜雪的亚麻布帽子。但我忽然意识到，她的脸上之所以会有皱纹，她的语气之所以如此严苛，或许正是因为她总是要面对我今天所看到的那些情景吧。





（五）


五月

姗姗来迟的春天，对于我们来说不单单意味着叶绿花开。英格兰周围海域的洋流不再像冬天时那么冰冷，我们住在这座小岛上，能感觉到海浪带着巨大的声响，冲击着我们的海岸。前一两个星期里，我经常看到有一些奇怪的行人，我猜他们可能是朝圣者，也可能是沿街叫卖的小贩，也或许是相伴去往伦敦或北方的绅士。这样的季节里，尽管身体需要保持冷静，但是那颗心却总是被希冀和渴望占据着。太阳落山的那一刻被延长了，仿佛有新的光线在西边凝聚，使人忍不住遐想有一种比阳光更为白亮的光彩在缓缓向整片大地弥漫。当你坐着做针线活时，或者出去散步时，你的眼帘都能感觉到它。

五月的一个清晨，天空明朗，正因被烦恼困扰而躁动时，我们看到一个男人沿着这条路大步走来。迈着矫健步伐的同时，他不停地挥舞手臂，如同在跟空气说话。他的背上有一只大皮包，手里还拿着一本厚厚的羊皮书，他不时往书上瞅上一眼，口中还大声念叨着什么。那个声音起起落落，跟他的步调一致，特别有节奏，听起来像是在抱怨，又像是在恫吓什么。我和杰里米向后退缩，紧靠在树篱上，他看见我们后脱下帽子，向我们深深地鞠了一躬，我只能行礼以示回敬。

“小姐，”他用一种低沉如夏日闷雷的声音问，“请问这条路是去朗文顿的吗？”

“再往前走一英里就到了，先生。”我回答道。

同时，杰里米还用他的手杖为他指了指。

他合上了那本书。立刻看起来头脑清晰多了，对时间和地点的感觉也分明了。

“哦，先生，我可否请教您一下，我去哪座宅邸更容易把这些书卖出去？我是从康沃尔一路走来的，一边为人们吟诵，一边出售我带来的这些书稿，可是至今我的皮包还是满满的。看上去对诗歌而言，时局十分不利啊。”他说。

这个人脸色红润，身体非常健壮，不过身上却衣衫褴褛，一双鞋子打满了补丁，估计走路的时候会特别难受。但他的奕奕神采告诉别人，他很愉快；他的一举一动也极有绅士风采，仿佛他本身就是一曲优美的音乐，思想凌驾于平凡人之上。

我拉了拉我弟弟的胳膊，说：“先生，我们就是住在宅院里的。我们乐意为您带路，我非常乐意看一看您的书。”他眼睛里的那种欢快忽然不见了，语气近乎严厉，问道：“您识字吗？”

“当然，琼经常埋头苦读的。”杰里米一边拉着我，一边大声说道。

“先生，您能讲一讲吟游途中的趣事吗？您去过伦敦吗？请问您叫什么名字？”

“先生，我叫理查德，”他微笑着说，“当然，我还有姓氏，不过别人从来没有用它称呼过我。我来自格维希恩，隶属康沃尔，我会的康沃尔的歌曲，这位小姐，绝对比整个公爵领地里的任何人都多。”他看向我，掏出一本书，拿在手上，接着说：“您看，就这么一本薄薄的书，所有圆桌骑士的传说都收录在里面了。它是安东尼大师亲手撰写的，插图是坎布里亚的修士们绘制的。我没有妻子儿女，可它比妻儿们更让我觉得珍贵。它对我来说还意味着酒肉饭食，因为吟游途中的晚餐和住宿费，都是我通过为人们吟唱书中的故事换来的。它还是我的马匹和拐杖，如此漫长的旅途全赖它的支撑我才能走下来。走南闯北，它是我最合拍的伴侣，因为它总是能提供给我新歌曲，而当我想要入睡时，它又会保持沉默。从古到今再没有比它更好的书了！”

我从没见过有人这样说话，他好像有些词不达意，不过他也不在意我们是否能听懂，只是专心致志地措辞，无论是严肃的话，还是逗乐的话。当我们走进院子，他停了下来，拍了拍鞋子上的尘土，又整理一下衣服，让它略微比原先整洁一点，他做这些动作的时候，手指特别灵巧。他清了清嗓子，就像人们唱歌前做的那样。我跑进去唤我的母亲，她慢悠悠地走到楼上的窗前，说在决定是否听他唱歌之前，要先看看他。

“妈妈，他背着整整一皮包的书呢，”我催促道，“所有亚瑟王和圆桌骑士的故事他都知道。我敢打赌，他一定也知道海伦嫁给她的丈夫后所发生的故事。妈妈，求你了，我们听他唱一唱吧！”

母亲被我的急躁逗笑了，她吩咐我把约翰爵士也叫来。如此晴朗的清晨，确实应该找点活动娱乐一下。

我跟约翰爵士从楼上下来的时候，理查德正来回走动着，给我弟弟讲他在旅途中的故事，讲到他一拳砸在一个男人的脑袋上，又冲另一个喊：“‘来啊，你这个坏蛋！’然后他们就一窝蜂逃走了，就像……”正讲到这里，他瞧见了我的母亲，于是习惯性地从头上摘下帽子。

“先生，我女儿跟我说，您是从其他地方过来的，还会唱歌？我们都是些没见识的乡下人，所以对其他地方的故事所知甚少。但我们很乐意听一听。您不妨就先唱一唱您家乡的故事吧，然后，如果您愿意的话，可以坐下来和我们一起吃点肉，我们很乐意听一听您家乡的新鲜事。”

她坐在橡树底下的一条长凳上。约翰爵士喘着粗气站在她的身旁。她吩咐杰里米把大厅的门打开，好让宅院里对此有兴趣的人进来。他们格外拘谨，不过出于好奇，还是走了进来，站在那里，瞪大眼睛静静地看着理查德。他再次摘下帽子，冲大家挥了挥。

他站在一个长有嫩绿青草的小土坡上，用婉转动听的旋律配以洪亮的嗓音，开始吟唱特里斯特拉姆与伊索尔特公主的故事。

他面上的欢快神情不见了，目光直视前方，望向我们的远方，抵达了遥远的彼方，就好像他所吟唱的故事就发生在不远处。他唱到最激动人心的部分，声音越来越高亢，他的双拳紧握，一只脚抬起来，双臂向前伸展。当唱到那两个相爱的人分别时，他就像是眼睁睁看着公主离特里斯特拉姆远去，而他的目光也随之望向远处，越来越远，越来越远，直至视线模糊，特里斯特拉姆的双臂间空无一物。而后，他又唱到特里斯特拉姆在布列塔尼半岛受伤，仿佛他听见了伊索尔特公主乘风破浪前去救他。

有些感觉我难以用语言形容，那种骑士们和他们心爱的姑娘们飘荡在空气中，在我们的四周徘徊走动，牵着彼此的手，在彼此的耳畔细语呢喃，对我们视而不见的感觉。接着，那些佩戴着金银珠宝的人们被白杨树和海滩上的树弹飞到空中，然后又从空中缓缓飘落下来。忽然间，这个清晨就淹没在细语声、叹息声、恋人的哀苦声中了。

突然，歌声停止了。所有的人影都退了回去，飞向天空，向着他们居住的西方渐渐远去，逐渐消失。我睁开眼睛，理查德，灰色的墙壁和站在门口的那些人们，都像是从深邃的水中缓缓往上浮一样，逐渐在水面上显现出来，清晰起来。

“可怜的人啊！”母亲说。

这时，理查德就像一个怀中失去了什么东西的人一样，一拳打在空气中。他看着我们，我甚至想要伸出手去告诉他他很安全。不过他随即恢复过来，冲着大家微笑，仿佛有值得他高兴的某种理由。

他看到站在门口熙熙攘攘的人群后，唱了一曲欢快的曲子，是深棕色头发的少女与她的心上人的故事。他们都笑得前仰后合，不能自已。

接着，母亲叫我们进屋用餐，她安排理查德坐在她的右侧。

他大快朵颐，酒肉一股脑地吞下肚了，就像是一直以来都是以野蔷薇果和山楂果充饥，用山溪水解渴的一样。当肉食撤下去后，他转身去拿那只皮包，神情庄重而严肃，从中取出一大堆五花八门的东西，把它们摆放在桌子上。这里面有扣环、胸针、串珠项链，以及许多订起来的羊皮纸，不过没有他的那本书厚。他似乎看出了我迫切的心情，于是把那本珍贵的书稿放在我的手里，让我看里面的插图。这部作品真的是太漂亮了，大写字母里面镶嵌着如蓝宝石一样的天空和金色的长袍，正文里是大幅的彩色插图，你能看到城镇里处于队列当中的王子和公主，悬崖峭壁上有教堂，之下是涌动的碧蓝大海。它们就如镜子一样，将我刚才在空中看到的那些景象再次映照出来，不过这里的它们是被描绘下来的，不会消失。

“这样的景物，您亲眼见过吗？”我问他。

“只要去看，总能遇见。”他故作神秘地回答。之后他把书册从我手中拿走，认真地捆好封面，放进他胸前的口袋里。

这本书就如弥撒书一样，在虔诚的神父手里逐渐泛黄，变得粗糙，可是书里那美丽的诗歌以及永远回荡的曲调，令骑士们和姑娘们的形象永葆光辉。他合上放进外套衣兜里的，是一个奇妙的梦幻国度。

我们留他住了一晚，实际上，只要他愿意留下来继续为我们唱歌，他可以多住些日子的。可惜他没有满足我们的心愿，就如常春藤里的猫头鹰那样，仅仅说了一句话：“我的旅途只有驿站，没有终点。”天刚亮他便离开了屋子，在我们的心里，他就像一只落在我们屋顶上的陌生鸟儿，仅仅休息片刻便又飞走了。

仲夏

一年中最美的一周——也或许仅仅是一天——到来了。它停留在一年的最高峰，在这段或长或短的时间里静止下来，仿佛有一个极为重要的问题需要它想明白，然后它就会像一位从王位上退下来的君王，一步步走下来，消失于黑暗中。

但数字是一个不可信赖的东西！

这时候，我如同被扔进了一片无与伦比的平静国度，仿佛到了世界的另一面。国家恢复了和平，我们生活的这个偏僻之地又恢复了喧嚣——我的父亲和兄弟们都在家——一切都是那么的圆满。你可以直接飞跃天宇来到我们的屋顶，而不需要翻越任何沟壑天堑。

因此，在这个时节开启我们前往沃森汉圣母神殿的仲夏朝圣之旅是再合适不过的了。尤其是我，我要向圣母感恩，因为她在很多事情上都保佑了我，我还要祈求她继续保佑。我将于今年的十二月二十日与艾米亚斯爵士成婚，我们双方都在紧锣密鼓的筹备中。因此，为了表示谦卑，昨天天刚蒙蒙亮，我就出发，徒步前往圣殿。这是一条漫长的路，不过如此才更显虔诚！

如果你带着一种从未有过的心情出发，就如一匹米粟喂养的马儿一样。她会驮着你四处奔跑，仰首奋蹄，快若风驰。她走在路上，无拘无束，她在沾有露珠的草地上飞奔，将漫山遍野的娇艳花朵踩在脚下。

不过，空气越来越热了，你会勒令仍旧扬蹄飞奔的马儿回到大路上。她会驮着你轻快的前行，一直到正午时分，你不得不稍作歇息。实事求是，毫不夸张地说，当你的双脚迈着轻快的步伐自由前行，任由清晰的意识在凝滞的精神迷宫里随意穿行时，越来越熟练，越来越敏捷。我就花了整整一周的时间在房间里幻想步行穿越沃森汉的短短三个小时，我想我的练习已经足够多了。

最初，我的大脑非常活跃，心情也格外舒畅，如孩童一般欢快奔跑跳跃。后来，我又及时冷静下来，认真地走路，即便这样我也特别开心。我想到一生中最沉重的东西——比如衰老，贫穷，疾病，死亡，想到我的一生终要经历这些。我还想到一生中终将经历的那些快乐和悲伤的事情。小事情不再像从前那样使我高兴或者使我烦恼。可是，尽管这些令我感到沉重，我却明白，我已经到了要经历它们的时候了。我甚至觉得我应该体会这些感觉，并且研究它们，就像当初聆听理查德歌唱故事时所做的那样。

我将它们视作纯净透明的水晶球，里面是缤纷绚烂的大地和天空，微不足道的男人和女人劳作着，就像在苍穹之下一般。

众所周知，沃森汉只是一个坐落在山顶上的小小村庄。不过，当你穿过那一片绿意盎然的平原，尚未到达沃森汉时，隔着很远你就能望见这个高耸的山丘。正午，夺目的阳光洒满沼泽地，绿色的植被和蓝色的水泽交相辉映，置身其中，仿佛来到了一片安宁富饶的陆地，如一本流光溢彩的画册，闪闪发光。走向陡峭的山顶，阳光照耀着一个尖挺向上的建筑物，它如同一座骨塔般素白。

最终，我达到了山顶，加入到众多朝圣者组成的洪流中。我们手牵着手，表现出作为凡人的谦卑姿态，一边沿着最后一段山路，向着山顶走去，一边唱着《求主垂怜曲》。

山顶上聚集着众多男男女女，其中不乏瘸子和盲人，有的人衣衫褴褛，有的人骑在马背上。我承认我好奇地打量着他们的脸。有一刻我甚至绝望地想：我们被泥沼与血肉隔开，这是何等的悲哀。他们一定有着新奇而快乐的故事可以讲述。

但是现在，我看到了那个淡色的十字架和圣母神像，我的脑海中只剩下对她的无比崇敬。

我不愿意装作没有感受到那种强烈的召唤。神像已经在风雨的侵蚀下变得粗糙、褪去了颜色。可是，当我竭力想如他人那样向她表示崇拜时，我的脑海中却被那个巨大而又苍白的身影占据了，除它之外容不下任何别的想法。有一刻，我屈服于她，带着极致的虔诚，卖力地亲吻着她那粗糙的石头外衣，直到嘴唇发肿。我没有戴帽子，汗水直接从头顶蒸发，像是冒出了缕缕烟雾一样。当狂喜冷却之后，山脚下那片田野，就像是旌旗一样在我面前蓦然展开。





（七）


秋季

秋天如期而至，意味着我的婚期将近。艾米亚斯爵士是一位真正的绅士，他对我谦恭有礼，竭尽所能让我开心。大概没有任何一首诗能够描述我们之间的爱恋关系吧。无可否认，自从我读了公主们的故事，我有时候也会因为自己的命运与她们的迥然相异而伤心落寞。不过，毕竟她们没有生活在内战时期的诺福克。况且，母亲还曾对我说，真实拥有的才是最好的。

母亲开始让我帮助她管理家务和田地诸事，以便让我明了作为人妻该负的职责。我逐渐明白，我的婚后生活，应是绝大多数时间都要放在思考与男人和幸福无关的事情上。我的领主丈夫会经常不在家，而那时我就要把我的身心和所有的判断力都放在羊群、林木、庄稼和家奴上。倘若遇上如今这般动乱的年份，我还要充当丈夫的左膀右臂，担负起排兵布阵、对抗敌人的职责。另外，作为女人，应对家中的琐碎之事也是我的天职。的确，如母亲所言，我根本没有时间去幻想什么王子与公主！她继续为我诠释她对“土地所有者”的理解。在这样一个时代里，作为这样一个被海水围困的小岛的管辖者，该如何在小岛上修筑道路，如何建造堤坝阻截海潮，如何培育并栽种农作物。

或许某一天海水会从这里退去，这块巴掌大的土地会准备好与一个新的世界相连接。她梦想中的英格兰，未来就是这个样子的，她一生的梦想就是管理好自己的这块封地，任谁踩上去都会觉得它厚实。她命令我必须渴望自己能够活着看见英格兰成为一个和平稳定的国家。假如我真的能够看到，我应该感谢我的母亲，以及所有像她一样的妇女。

有一点不容辩白，即便我仰慕我的母亲，并尊重她说的每一句话，但我心底深处其实并不完全认同她的话。或许，她最美好的愿望，就是有一天土地能够从包围它的海水中升上来。我相信，在她的心里最美好的前景，就是有一条宽阔的大路将这片土地与大世界贯通起来，而她能看见人们骑在马上排着长长的队列闲庭信步似的缓缓的在大路上骑行，前往朝圣的人们不必再带任何武器，一路欢笑地行走着，路上马车川流不息，它们装载着货物去往海岸，回来时又从海岸那边拉回满船的货物。她还梦想所有的大房子都能映入眼帘，没有阻隔；护城河被填平，瞭望塔被拆除；家家都敞开大门，欢迎每一个过往之客；领主能够与客人、仆人同桌共饮，与他们共庆欢呼；骑马游览时，路旁的农田里种满了粮食，牧场上有成群的家禽与牛羊，贫民也能住上石头建筑的小房子。这些美好的景状从我的笔端落于纸上时，我就觉得这些希望都是正确的。

可是，假如我真的置身于这些想象中的场景时，我大概并不会觉得它十分美好吧，那么完美的生活我一定适应不来。

那么，我究竟渴望着什么东西呢？虽然我渴望它，默默地期待它，我却不清楚它是什么。我经常——随着时间的推移，现在更加频繁——在走路时忽然停下来，好像我所熟悉的这块土地突然间就换了一个面貌。它在向我暗示什么？我尚未弄懂它就消失了。好比一张熟悉的脸，露出了一个陌生的微笑，它会吓你一跳，但同时也会吸引你。





最后的几页


昨日，我坐在平常写日记的书桌前，这时父亲进来了。我会读书写字令他感到骄傲，可以说，是他把我抱在他的腿上手把手教会我读写的。

但当他问我在写什么时，我感到一阵茫然，我支支吾吾地说在写“日记”，并用手捂住那张纸。

“哦，”他感叹道，“要是我父亲也爱写日记就好了！可惜，他是个可怜的人，连他自己的名字都不会写。约翰、皮尔斯、斯蒂芬都在那边的教堂里长眠，可是没有一个字能证明他们是好人还是坏人。”他一直说个不停，直到我的脸色又苍白起来。

“这样一来我的外孙就会谈论起我，”他还在继续说，“如果可以，我想亲手写下这些话：‘我是贾尔斯·马丁，身材匀称，皮肤偏黑，眼睛浅褐色，留有胡须。我识字，不过有限。我骑着全县最好的那匹母红鬃马去过伦敦。’”

“我还应该补充些什么呢？也不知他们有没有兴趣听。另外，他们又会是谁？”他笑了起来。他习惯在说完话后笑一笑，哪怕开始说的时候非常严肃。

“既然您想知道您父亲的生平，”我说，“那么他们为什么会没兴趣听呢？”

“我的先人们都是我这个样子，他们所有的人都生活在这儿。他们耕种的田地，就是我现在耕种的这块田地，他们迎娶的妻子，也是乡下人。嘿，说不定，要是他们现在从大门走进来，我一眼就能认出他们，根本不会觉得奇怪。不过——”他耸了耸肩，“谁能说得准呢？没准儿等到将来我们会从大地上被冲刷掉呢，琼。”

“不，不，”我大声说，“我们一定会永远住在这儿的，我确信！”

父亲暗暗高兴，还有谁能比他自己更加在乎他的土地和他的名字呢？尽管他坚定地认为，要是我们家族的人能够自尊心更强一些，我们早就过上比现在更好的日子了。

“很好，琼，你一定要坚持写日记。说得更确切一点，我必须替你保存好它们。”父亲说，“因为你就要离开我们了，虽然不会走得太远——”他转念又道，“至于名字，并不是很重要，我只是希望你走后，我们至少还有你留下的这些纪念品。而且，这样一来，我们俩至少有一个有资格让我们的后代们敬重了。”他看着我整洁的文字，一个劲地发出赞赏。“至于现在，我的女儿，跟我一起去趟教堂吧，无论如何我也要看看我父亲的墓碑上刻了些什么。”

我们走在路上的时候，我又想起他说的那些话，以及珍藏在我橡木书桌里的那些纸。自从我第一次带着自豪的心情在它们上面写下那些花体字，已经过去了一年，严冬又悄然来临了。我的自尊心非常强烈，并且我想着诺福克很少有女性做这样的事情，若非如此，我的日记早就中断了。因为，事实上，在我平淡无奇的生活中，并没有什么事情值得记述，这种记录我早已厌倦。当我感受着冬季清晨寒冷的空气，漫步而行的时候，我就想：以后假如我还会写日记，我不会再写诺福克的事或我自己的事了，我会写公主与骑士，会写他们在奇幻世界的冒险经历。

云朵从西方涌来，逐渐吞没天空，它们像是队长与士兵。而后，我又不由自主觉得，有些云朵真的像是头盔和宝剑，而有些则像洁白的容颜、高贵的头饰。

但是，正如母亲所说，最好的故事是那些围坐在火堆旁时讲述的故事。要是我也能像那些老夫人一样，在冬天夜幕降临时，让全家人静静地围坐在她身边，听她讲她耳闻目睹的那些奇闻逸事和她年轻时候的事迹，让一天在这样的氛围中结束，我一定会感到心满意足的。我迄今都觉得，那些故事有一部分是云朵赐予的，要不然，为何它们会比我听闻过的那些事情更加令人感动呢？没有任何书籍能与它们相提并论。

爱尔贝莎·艾斯克夫人就是这样的一位老夫人。她的年纪大了，身体已大不如前，肌肉发僵，连站起来都做不到，更别说织毛衣或缝补衣服了。所以她终日两只手交握着，坐在火堆跟前。你只需扯扯她的袖子，她的那双眼睛立刻就会亮起来，给你讲述战争和国王以及权贵的故事、也有穷人们的故事，一直讲到连空气也似乎呢喃动荡起来。她还会自编自唱民谣——那些词都是她坐在那里时自己编的。不论男女老少，人们都从远方赶来，只为听她吟唱。他们认为她还能够算命。

我们走到了教堂，这是我的先祖们沉睡的地方，闻名遐迩的雕刻大师诺里奇的拉尔夫最近为我的爷爷修建了一座墓，已经快竣工了。我们走进教堂，这里光线幽暗，烛焰笔直。我们跪下来，为他的灵魂祈祷。然后父亲便去跟约翰爵士谈话了，而我就留在这里做我最喜欢做的事情——拼写他们的名字，以及观摩我已故的祖先和亲戚们的雕像的容貌。我知道在我小的时候，我非常害怕这些白色的雕像，尤其是当我知道他们跟我同姓的时候。不过现在，我知道它们从不翻身，并且双手一直交握着，我就开始同情他们，并做些小动作来逗他们开心——一定是些秘密的，又没有人想到过的动作，——一个吻或轻抚，就像他们活生生站在我面前一样。

弗拉希


第一章　三里口


这篇传记的主人公，属于一个极其古老的家族，这个家族的传承相当久远，这一点无人怀疑。所以这个姓氏的起源早已湮灭在历史中，我们也就无从考究了。在几百万年以前，现在被称为西班牙的地方，正处于蒙昧时代，格外的喧嚣、纷乱。然后漫长的一段时间过去，这里出现了植被。按照自然法则定律，有植被的地方当然就会有兔子，而天意安排，有兔子的地方就必然会有狗。这都是不需要讨论就有的结果。不过我们为什么会称呼捕猎兔子的狗叫西班尼尔呢？这个问题令所有人感到迷惑，无法给出标准答案。某些历史学家认为当西班牙这块土地上第一次出现迦太基[1]人时，他们看到从草丛里、灌木丛里突然蹿出一个个兔子来，于是士兵们就不约而同地大声喊出“西班！西班！”。这片土地上满是兔子。在迦太基语中，西班的发音表示兔子。“荷西班尼牙”的意思就是“兔子王国”，这片土地名称的由来就是这样。另外，在人们发现兔子的同时，还发现了疯狂追赶兔子的狗，于是它们被称为“西班尼尔”，也就是“兔犬”。

或许有了这样的解释已经能够令很多人满意了，可是基于事实，我有必要补充一下另一个学派的不同观点。他们认为，在迦太基人的语言中，“西班”与“荷西班尼牙”根本八竿子打不着。“荷西班尼牙”的意思是“边缘”或“边境”，是从巴斯克语“厄西班尼亚”演变过来的。假如这种说法更加贴近事实的话，显然，那一幅浪漫喜悦的画面——士兵、灌木丛、兔子、狗——就要从我们的脑海里消失了。“西班尼尔”之所以被叫作“西班尼尔”，我们就有了一个简单到不能再简单的原因——因为西班牙被称为“厄西班尼牙”。还有第三个学派的学者也有自己的看法，不过他们所坚持的看法有些荒诞，猜测的成分居多，不值得讨论。他们说，西班牙人用“罗圈腿”或“凸背”称呼他们的爱犬（“厄西班尼牙”这个词也含有这样的释义），就如一个情人常常称呼他们的情妇为“妖怪”或“猴子”一样，大家都知道，西班尼尔狗与那种丑陋的异类正好是相反的。

我们先把上述的或其他的这些搞不清楚也没必要搞清楚的理论统统放下，让我们来看看十世纪中叶就拥有了西班尼尔狗的威尔士。有人认为，在几个世纪以前，西班牙的一个大族艾波尔家族或者是埃佛尔家族就把这种狗带到了这里来。有一点可以肯定，到了十世纪中叶，这种狗就相当有名了，值钱得不得了。“国王的西班尼尔狗价值一英镑”——这是豪威尔·达所制定的法典里的规定。在公元948年，一英镑能够买多少女人、奴隶、牛马、鸡鹅？如果你还记得这段历史，就能够领会那时的西班尼尔狗是多么珍贵了。那时它就已经在国王的身边享有一席之地。它的家庭成员也被众多声名显赫的王族喂养在身边。当不兰他日奈家族[2]、都铎家族[3]和斯图亚特家族[4]都还没有坐上王位时，西班尼尔狗就已经在宫廷里享受荣华富贵了。而早在霍华德、卡文迪什和罗塞尔家族[5]的名字从诸如史密斯、琼斯、汤姆金斯等姓氏中声名鹊起之前，西班尼尔狗的家族就已卓越不凡、非同一般。西班尼尔狗的家族，发展到后来产生了一些不算太大的分支。渐渐地，跟随着英国历史的步伐，至少有七个品种的西班尼尔狗出现了，每一种都非常有名：科朗博尔、萨塞克斯、诺福克、哈菲尔德、科克尔、爱尔兰沃尔特，以及英格兰沃尔特。它们都与历史悠远的纯种西班尼尔狗一脉相承，但也体现着各自与众不同的特点。因此，理所当然的，它们也享受了优越的待遇。狗中的贵族阶级，是在伊丽莎白女王[6]执政的时候产生的。这是有确切证据的。菲利普·雪尼爵士[7]在《阿卡迪亚》中这样写道：“艾斯潘犬是犬中贵族，西班尼尔是犬中绅士，猎犬是犬中平民。”

如果我们以此为据假定西班尼尔狗遵循人类的原则，觉得艾斯潘犬比自己高一等，觉得普通的猎犬比自己低一等，那么，我们便不可否认，它们划分贵族的理由要比我们人类充分得多。至少研究过西班尼尔俱乐部的法则的人，一定会得出同样的结论。这个团体的可敬之处在于，它把西班尼尔狗的优点和缺陷都规定得一清二楚，比如，眼睛颜色太淡是一种欠缺，耳朵弯曲的话更不必说，要是鼻子颜色太浅，头部枕骨突出的话，那就糟糕透顶了。西班尼尔狗的优点也同样规定得十分详细，比如：额头一定要光滑；吻部以上没有明显凸起；颅骨一定要比较浑圆，以为脑力开发提供足够的空间；眼睛必须要大而不突；让人一眼看去就觉得温顺、聪明。西班尼尔狗中但凡拥有这些优点的都格外受宠，并肩负起了繁衍后代的责任。至于那些眼睛颜色太浅、枕骨突出的西班尼尔狗，则无法享受到它们的同类所享受的特权和宠爱。那些专家们不但做了这些规定，而且为了保证这些规定得以落实，还制定了奖罚制度。

但是我们回过头来看看，我们人类的社会又是怎样的混乱不堪啊！又有哪个团队有这样的权力划分人类的品种呢？我们在功能上与西班尼尔俱乐部最接近的机构，就是“宗谱纹章协会”，至少，它为维持人类家族的纯洁做了一些尝试。但是当问及是什么因素决定出身的高贵——是眼睛颜色深浅吗？还是耳朵曲直呢？枕骨要是突出的话，是不是格外致命的缺陷呢？我们的评判者对此哑口无言，仅仅会去参考我们臂膀上的族徽。你或许根本就没有这玩意儿，那你就是个无名小卒。但一旦你有王族的徽记，并证实你是某个王子或者贵胄的后代，那么他们便会承认你的存在，而且还会宣称：你的身份高贵不俗。居住在梅菲尔的那些人家，几乎每一只调味瓶上都会刻有纹章徽记，要么是或蹲或卧的狮子，要么是站立的美人鱼。就连亚麻布的制造商们，也会在大门上挂上一个皇族的徽章，就好像这是一种证明：睡在他们出售的床单上就是安全的。人们肯定了这种等级制度的优越性，所以森严的等级也就比比皆是了。不过当我们进行一番实际考察后就会摇头叹气了，觉得还是西班尼尔狗俱乐部的专家们更靠谱一些——波旁王室、哈布斯堡王室、侯恩佐伦王室拥有那么多的王冠、蹲伏的狮子、直立的豹子以及纹章盾面，可是到头来却只能流落到异国他乡，再无人尊重，再无丝毫特权。为了得到进一步证实，我们不妨从这些重要的问题上跳出来，来思考一下米特福德家的弗拉希的早期生活。

大约在十八世纪末期，一窝有着名贵血统的西班尼尔狗正生活在离雷丁[8]不远的一位姓米德福德或米特福德的医生的家里。这位绅士深谙“宗谱纹章协会”的精髓，选择了米特福德作为自己的姓，并且把这个作为依据，宣称自己是伯特伦堡的米特福德家族的诺桑巴尔兰德的后裔。至于他的妻子，由于姓拉塞尔，那必然是多少与贝德弗德公爵沾上一点亲的嘛。不过，没有一个专家承认他的家族血统纯正，或是允许他这种品种长存，谁让米特福德的先祖们无视原则，在择偶时那么肆意妄为呢？他有一双浅色的眼睛，一双弯曲的耳朵，和一个有着致命缺陷的突出的枕骨。换句话说，他有着各种不折不扣的毛病：自私、粗心、虚伪、好赌、浪荡、庸俗。他挥霍自己的财产、妻子的财产和女儿的收入。手头有钱的时候，他从来不管他的妻子和女儿，不过等老了以后，却又赖着她们不放。要说他没有优点，倒也有两个：一个是长得比较好看，像太阳神阿波罗——直到他暴饮暴食，肆意酗酒，将太阳神阿波罗变成了酒神巴克斯——另一个就是，他全心全意地爱狗。但你根本不用怀疑，假如人类社会真有一个类似于西班尼尔狗俱乐部的俱乐部，无论他是宣称伯特伦堡的米特福德是他的本家，还是他把“米德福德”写成“米特福德”，都挡不住别人来嘲笑他，辱骂他，视他为野种，无资格繁衍后代；一点作用也没有，并不能保护他犯了法以后不受制裁。可是他始终是个人，所以没有什么东西来阻止他娶一位贵族小姐为妻，并与她生一个女儿，而他自己活到八十岁高龄，还拥有好几代艾斯潘犬和西班尼尔狗。

直到目前为止，还没有任何研究能够证实弗拉希出生的确切年份，更别提精确到月日了。不过有一种较大的可能，他诞生于1842年年初的某一天，而且可能真的是特拉伊的直系后裔。不过令人沮丧的是，关于那条特别有名气的狗的优点，只能从现在的那些不太可信的诗歌中来了解了。这些诗歌证实，他是一只出色的红色科克尔西班尼尔狗。倒是有充分的理由来证明弗拉西是那只“真正的老科克尔西班尼尔狗”的儿子。当时有人想要买走弗拉希的父亲，出价高达二十几尼，但“因为它在赛狗大会上出尽风头”，所以米特福德医生想都没想就拒绝了。想要知道年轻时候的弗拉希是什么模样，我们只能借助现存的诗歌了。他有着一身深褐色的皮毛，当阳光照在他的身上时，闪耀出的是“一片金色”。“华丽的长毛覆盖在他细长的腿上”，他的尾巴蓬松而肥大。他的耳朵“像丝绒做成的穗儿一样”。他长着一双“浅褐色的，善良而机敏”的眼睛。就算考虑到诗歌对韵律格外讲究，并且诗歌的语言风格并不讲求精确，这些描述也全都符合西班尼尔狗俱乐部的标准。弗拉希具备了他那个品种的所有优秀特征，显而易见，它是一只纯种的红色科克尔犬。

他出生后，最初的几个月生活在三里口，一间工人的小房子，离雷丁不太远。米特福德一家这时已经近乎穷困潦倒了——他们家的仆人只剩下了科伦哈泼克一个了——家里所有的椅套，用的都是最廉价的布料，而且都是米特福德小姐亲手缝制的——最重要的家具，是一张大桌子。最重要的房间，是一间大温室——恐怕弗拉希并没有享受过像他这种品质的狗理应享受的奢华生活，比如防雨的狗窝、贴身伺候的女用或侍童、水泥面儿的遛狗小道等。但弗拉希依旧长得非常健壮，他尽情享受着生活中他的活泼气质带来的大部分乐趣，以及他的年轻和性别带来的自然应有的快乐。米特福德小姐平常总是窝在家里，她不得不一连几小时大声读书给她的父亲听，再陪他玩纸牌游戏，直到她父亲睡着，她还得趴在温室的那张桌子上一个劲地写作，好挣些钱来交付账单、偿还债务。最终，一天最令人盼望的时刻来临了。她把纸张推到一边，带上伞，戴上帽子，带着几只狗来到田野散步。西班尼尔狗有一个天性，那就是通情达理，而弗拉希比一般的狗更能理解人类的情感，本文将证实这一点。他所热爱的女主人总算是呼吸到了新鲜空气，她的白发被微风轻轻吹起，她生来就红扑扑的脸蛋儿也沐浴在清风中，她那宽额头上的皱纹也舒展开来了，一看到这些，他就会兴奋地四处蹦跳，其中有一半都是在为她的快乐而感到快乐。当她跨过茂密的草丛时，他就将又高又密的草丛分开，好让她在绿色里穿行。露珠和雨滴在他的鼻尖溅开，落下去，凉凉的水雾像一道彩虹一样。他的脚掌被时硬时软、时冷时暖的土地刺激着，戏弄着，仿佛是在对着他脚底那柔软的肉垫呵痒。接着，各种各样的气味以微妙的组合交织在一起，刺激着他的鼻孔：有强烈的泥土味，花香味，还有树叶和荆棘难以名状的香味，他们在路上闻到的酸味，还有在豆子地里闻到的辛辣气味。突然，一种气味从风中飘来，钻进了他的大脑里，它是那么强烈，那么具有诱惑力，激起了他的千种本能，勾起了他的万种回忆——这是兔子的气味！狐狸的气味！他迅速冲了过去，宛如一条在湍急的河流中横冲直下的鱼儿。这一刻，他忘记了他的女主人，甚至忘记了所有人类。“西班！西班！”他听见黝黑的人们在呼唤，听见皮鞭在空中抽响，他奔跑着，冲撞着，最终迷迷糊糊地停了下来，魔咒消失了。“弗拉希！弗拉希！”米特福德小姐站在远处，手里的雨伞在挥动。他羞涩地摆动着尾巴，慢慢地小跑穿过草丛回到米特福德小姐身边。那个魔咒的召唤还有更急迫的时候，那一次，打猎的号角声把他灵魂深处的本能唤醒了，把他更狂野、更强烈的感情唤醒了，他忘却了树木，忘却了野草，甚至忘却了兔子和狐狸，他是那般激动，不由得狂叫出声。他听到了维纳斯狩猎的号角，他看到爱神点燃了火炬。在他还没有完全成年之前，他就当上了爸爸。

就算是在1842年，要是某个男人做出这样的行为，谁若为他著书立传，也必须先找出各种理由来为他把这件事澄清。要是做出这种事的是某个女人，那她的名字就必然会被以玷污之名从书册上抹去，无论什么样的辩解都显得苍白无力。不过犬类世界的道德准则，无论是比我们好的，还是比我们坏的，肯定是跟我们存在着本质区别的，所以弗拉希即便做出这样的行为，我们也完全用不着为他遮掩。他也不会因此被认定不适宜生活在当时英国由贞洁无瑕的人群组成的社会之中。换言之，有证据表明，当时普希医生的哥哥特别想买下弗拉希。我们能通过普希医生高尚的品德来推断出他哥哥的品德。由此可知，弗拉希作为一条狗，就算他举止轻佻，可也不妨碍他将会成为一条庄重沉稳、拥有大好前途的狗。还有另一个更为充分的证据能够证明他天生就具有迷人的品质——普希先生想要买下他，可是米特福德小姐却断然拒绝了。要知道，米特福德小姐那时正处于最艰难的时刻，想要拒绝普希医生哥哥的金钱诱惑，是相当不容易的。那会儿她对于该写怎样的悲剧，该编辑怎样的年鉴都是毫无头绪的，她不得不做她最不愿意做的事——借助朋友的接济来生活。弗拉希父亲的身价曾经高达二十英镑，有人出过这个价，至于弗拉希，米特福德小姐完全也可以为弗拉希要价十英镑或十五英镑。对于米特福德小姐来说，十英镑或十五英镑绝对是一笔极其可观的巨款了。有了这些钱，她就可以重新修葺她的温室，更换她的椅套，为自己买满满一橱柜的衣服。“四年来，我一顶帽子、一件长外套、一件披风都没有买过，甚至连一双手套都没有买过。”她在1842年这样写道。

可是即便这样，她也绝不会考虑卖掉弗拉希。弗拉希是那种无法用金钱来估量的罕见宝物。他的罕见不是那种建立在金钱之上的罕见，因为它所体现的是一种精神上的友爱，他只能作为体现无私友谊的礼物，恰当地赠送给友人。如果一个人运气足够好，能够有这么一位朋友，一位就像是自己的女儿一样的朋友，来接受这件礼物的话。米特福德小姐就有这样的一位朋友。她过着与世隔绝的生活，终年都躺在温珀尔大街的一所宅子后面的卧室里。她就是英国最伟大的女诗人，才华横溢、命运多舛、令人敬仰的伊丽莎白·巴雷特！还有什么能比弗拉希更适合作为一份珍贵的礼物赠予这样一位友人呢？每当米特福德小姐带弗拉希在阳光下奔跑或打滚的时候，每当她来到伦敦，来到那间爬满常春藤的昏暗卧室里，坐在巴雷特小姐病床边上的时候，这种想法就会源源不断地涌进她的脑海。是的，也只有巴雷特小姐才有资格拥有一条弗拉希这样的好狗，反过来，也只有弗拉希这样的好狗才有资格拥有巴雷特小姐这样的主人。无疑，这对米特福德小姐来说是一个巨大的牺牲，不过她愿意做这样的牺牲。于是，可能是在1842年夏初的某一天吧，或许有人看到了这样的一幕，一对奇怪的组合步行在温珀尔大街上——一个年纪已不小的胖乎乎的矮个子女人，满头白发，不过脸色红润，穿着一身看起来有些寒酸的衣服，牵着一条东瞅瞅西望望、全身都长满金毛、被铁链牵着的、精神奕奕的科克尔西班尼尔小狗。他们走到50号宅院的门口止住了步伐。抱着胆怯的心，米特福德小姐按响了门铃。

就算是今天，无论是谁按响了温珀尔大街的门铃，都必然会心生忐忑。它可是伦敦最具威严、最没人情味的一条街。即便是文明基石被动摇，朝不保夕，世界即将倾塌，离毁灭只有一步之遥，但只要你来到温珀尔大街上看一看，来这条街上走一走，你就会发现，这里的房屋在风格上依然是那么统一，连整洁而奢华的窗帘都会让你惊叹不已，连大门上那排列得整整齐齐的扣环都让你心生赞叹。你不妨再看看厨子们是如何与屠夫为一根肘子讨价还价的，你可以推测下这条街上的居民是否遵纪守法，并且估量一下他们的收入。当你来到温珀尔大街，你深深地呼吸几口只有有权有势的人们才能呼吸到的宁静空气，你就会不由自主地发出叹息，心怀感恩，因为那些古老的帝国都已经成了历史云烟，科林斯、麦思纳都已经倒台，王冠落在地上，一切随风飘散，可是温珀尔大街还是一如既往。从温珀尔大街走到牛津街上，你会发自内心地向上天祈祷，希望温珀尔大街的一砖一石都保持从前的样子，连窗帘也不会产生任何变化，屠夫们可以永远不愁卖不出去东西，厨师们也可以永远不愁买不到牛肉、羊排、腰条、肘子和胸脯肉。因为只要温珀尔大街不动摇，文明就不会动摇。

温珀尔大街的管家们直到今天也是那样，走路的时候步履沉稳，一丝不苟。更别说是在1842年的夏天了，他们更是刻意如此。那个年代的仆役制度，苛刻程度远不是现在可比的：你擦拭银器的时候，必须穿绿台尼围裙；打开大厅之门的时候，必须穿有条纹的背心和黑色燕尾服，在那时，这样的礼仪必须严格遵守，远比现在严格。在50号的大门打开前，米特福德小姐和弗拉希至少在门前的台阶上等了有三分半钟。门最终打开了，米特福德小姐和弗拉西被迎入房门。米特福德小姐是这里的常客，虽然巴雷特小姐的府邸令她感到压抑，不过她从不会为这个府邸中的某样东西感到惊奇。但弗拉希就不一样了，直到此刻他涉足过的房子也只有三里口的那所工人的小房子，除此之外他再没有进过别的房子，因此来到这儿后他显得特别兴奋。三里口的那间房子里，木板光秃秃的，席子上磨起了毛刺儿，椅子也是便宜货，而这里却没有一件东西是光秃秃的，也没有一件东西磨起了毛刺，更没有一件东西是便宜货——弗拉希一眼就看出来了。巴雷特先生，这个宅邸的主人，是个相当有钱的商人，他儿女众多，且都已步入成年，他手底下还有一个按比例来说数目极其可观的仆役团。他的房子带有一些东方幻想色彩的情调，布置的时候参考的是三十年代末的风格样式。他曾经在什罗普郡[9]装修过一幢房子，出于对这种情调的偏爱，那所房子被装上了摩尔式[10]的拱顶和新月形的窗饰。不过这么高的要求在温珀尔大街是没办法达成的。我们倒是可以发挥下想象力——在那些幽暗的、又高又大的房间里，地板上铺着厚厚的华美地毯；土耳其式矮凳和雕花的红木家具满满当当地摆放在那里；所有的桌子都是螺旋状的桌腿，在桌面上摆放着琳琅满目的器皿，都是由金丝和银丝编织成的；或长或短的刀剑悬挂在暗红色的墙壁上，壁龛里放着他从位于东印度群岛的产业那里带回来的各种稀罕玩意儿。

当弗拉希尾随着跟在管家之后的米特福德小姐进入这所宅邸后，他用鼻子嗅到的惊奇，远远多于他用眼睛看到的。一股热乎乎的红烧肉、烤肘子、油烧鸡的香味顺着楼梯飘了下来。这种气味儿就跟食物本身一样令他嘴馋，要知道，以前的时候，科伦哈泼克只会给他做些炒杂碎、烧杂烩，干巴得可怜。还有一些其他的味道，混在了食物的气味儿当中——杉木、檀木和红木的气味；男人和女人的气味；男仆和女用的气味；外衣和裤子的气味；披风和裙子的气味；长毛绒挂帘和织锦挂帘的气味；葡萄酒和雪茄的气味，煤灰和烟雾的气味。餐厅、客厅、书房、卧室——每当他经过一个房间——都会飘出一种独特的气味，而后与整个房子的混合气味融汇到一起。当他的脚掌踩着那华美的软绒地毯向前走时，每走一步都能感受到一阵温柔的轻抚。最后，他们止步于房子后部一扇紧闭的门前。管家轻叩房门，门轻轻地开了。

巴雷特小姐的卧室肯定是很昏暗的，所有的记载都表明了这一点。平常的时候，从外面照射进来的光线被绿色的锦缎窗帘所遮挡，而到了夏天，因为窗台上的花箱里种满了常春藤、牵牛花、龙爪豆和金莲花，屋子里就更显得幽暗了。在这种朦朦胧胧的淡绿氛围中，弗拉希起初什么都看不清，只能看到有五个闪烁着神秘微光的圆球悬挂在高处，可是房间里的气味，却再次让他恍恍惚惚，飘飘曳曳。当他生平第一次站在温珀尔大街上的一间病人的卧室里，闻着科隆香水的味道时，他的心里边有着千千万万的感触和想法，他就像一个考古学者，慢慢走下一座陵墓，走进一间墙壁黏腻潮湿，被霉菌所覆盖，散发着阵阵腐烂和古迹的酸臭味的墓穴之中。他举着一盏小灯，晃晃悠悠地照着半空中那模模糊糊的大理石雕像，墓室里的所有事物，都随着欲明欲灭的灯火而若隐若现，他这里照照，那里照照——只有这种走进了一座深埋在早已毁灭的城市之下的墓穴里的探险家的心理感受才能跟弗拉希此时的感受相比。

弗拉希用鼻子嗅着，用爪子探索着，终于慢慢地通过轮廓辨认出了几样家具。靠近窗户的那个巨大的东西可能是一个衣橱，在衣橱的旁边，是一个五屉柜；屋子中央，有一个桌子模样的东西慢慢浮现出来，有一道环嵌在它的周围；随后，朦朦胧胧的扶手椅和桌子也逐渐显露出了身影。可是它们所显现出来的样貌都不是它们的本来样貌。有三个白色的胸像立在衣橱顶上；在五屉柜的顶上，则放着一只书箱，在书箱上蒙了一层暗红色的美利奴羊毛呢。还有两尊胸像立在盥洗台上的冠状架子上；这间屋子里的任何一件家具，都与他们的本来样子有很大差距，看起来都像是别的什么东西。你看那挂在窗户上的用来遮光的窗帘，连它都不是用寻常的平纹细布做的，而是用一种印有各种花纹的纺织物做成的，其上印着各种各样的城堡、城堡的大门、树林以及几个正在散步的农夫。这些已经扭曲了的东西，经过屋子里的几面镜子的进一步扭曲后——五尊诗人的胸像幻化成了十尊，两张桌子变成了四张桌子……弗拉希为此感到迷惑，当他看到墙壁上的一个洞里正有另一只狗在瞪着他时，他的恐惧就更加强烈了。那只狗把舌头伸在外面，不断眨动的眼睛炯亮炯亮的。他吃惊地停住脚步，而后又胆战心惊地继续朝前挪动步子。

就这样，弗拉希走走退退，退退走走，耳朵中除了能听到像是远方的微风拂过树梢一般的几个人的低语声外，他什么都听不到。他就像是一个惴惴不安、万分小心地挪动着双脚行走在树林里的探险家，看到一条树根就怀疑它是一条眼镜蛇，看到一片阴影，就以为那里有一头狮子。而后他甚至感到头顶上也有一些庞然大物在晃动，如此胆战心惊地度过了一个小时，弗拉希最终哆哆嗦嗦地钻到屏风后面。低语声停了，然后门也被关上了。有那么一刹那，他停驻，困惑，紧张不安。突然间，他那尘封的记忆复苏了，弗拉希像一头张牙舞爪的老虎一样，一个猛子扑了上去。他感到了孤独，他觉察到自己被抛弃了。他朝房门口冲过去。那扇门被关上了，他用自己的爪子挠，竖起一对耳朵倾听。他听到了有人下楼的脚步声，他知道那是属于他的女主人的熟悉的脚步声。脚步声停顿了，不不，又响起来了，它朝着楼下去了。米特福德小姐迈着缓慢而沉重的步子恋恋不舍地走下楼梯，当听到她的脚步声渐渐消失时，恐慌勒住了弗拉希。伴随着米特福德小姐走下楼梯，弗拉希看到，那一道道通向田野、通向自由、通向荒草、通向兔子的门全都关闭了。他所崇拜与敬重的女主人，那位给他洗澡、打他、把自己盘子里本就少得可怜的食物分给他的老太太，他再也见不到了。所有他所知道的幸福、爱抚、人类的恩宠都化作乌有了。听！那扇院门关上了。他形单影只了，她抛弃了他。

失落和绝望的巨浪朝他席卷而来，这难以扭转的命运给他带来的打击太过沉重，以使他仰头乱嚎。“弗拉希！”有一个声音叫道。他充耳不闻。“弗拉希！”这个声音又叫了他一遍。他为之一惊。他本以为这个世界只剩下他自己了，可是没想到房间里居然还有另一个活物跟自己在一起，他回过头来，难道沙发上有什么吗？不管它是什么，或许它能打开这扇门，这样他就能从这里出去，追赶上米特福德小姐了。焦急的弗拉希还怀着一个希望，这或许只是一个游戏，是他们以前经常在家里的温室中玩的捉迷藏——他向沙发那边跑去。

“喔！弗拉希！”巴雷特小姐说。这是她第一次认真打量弗拉希。这也是弗拉希第一次对这位躺在沙发上的小姐进行观察。

那一瞬间，他们都感到无比惊讶。巴雷特小姐那稠密的鬓发从脸颊两侧垂下，她的那双眼睛又大又亮，格外迷人，她正用她那张大嘴微笑着。弗拉希那一对肥厚的耳朵从脸颊两侧垂下，他的那双眼睛同样又大又亮，他也咧着阔阔的大嘴——他们之间有某种东西是一样的。他们互相凝视的时候，彼此都感到：这就是我吗？然而又会感到：但是多么不同啊！她的脸是一张病态的脸，虽然年轻，可是隔绝了空气，隔绝了阳光，隔绝了自由，是那么的憔悴。而他的脸，却是一张活力四射的动物的脸，年轻，红润，温暖，健康！他们就像是从同一个模子里拓出来的，却又大不相同。那么他们能不能唤醒彼此身体里沉眠的东西呢？能不能互补不足，相辅相成呢？这对她来说或许可以，完全可以！不过对他来说，不行！有一条区分不同生物的鸿沟隔在他们中间，不可逾越——她能说话，可他不能。一个人，一条狗，他们之间的差别是如此巨大，可他们却又如此紧密地走到了一起。他们互相凝望着。最后，弗拉希纵身跃到沙发上，躺在了那个从此以后他将一直躺的地方——巴雷特小姐脚边的毛毯上。





第二章　深闺


历史学家告诉我们，1842年的夏天与以往的夏天没有什么不同。但对于弗拉希来说，这个夏天与往年是大不相同的，他甚至怀疑，这个世界本身也发生了变化。这是一个在卧室里度过的夏天；这是一个和巴雷特小姐一起度过的夏天；这是一个在伦敦，在文明的心脏度过的夏天。起初，弗拉希除了卧室和其中的家具外，什么也没有看到，不过就是这些也足够令他震撼了。以他的脑瓜完全没办法把他所看到的这些形形色色的东西辨认出来，区别出来，并准确叫出它们的名字来。当他还没有习惯那些桌子、盥洗台和胸像——科隆香水味依旧折磨着他的鼻孔时，他们就迎来了一个难得的好天气。晴朗无风，温暖但不炙热，干爽但不起纤尘，这种好天气最适合病人出去走走，呼吸下新鲜空气了。巴雷特小姐能承受住同她妹妹一起逛街的巨大风险的日子来临了。

叫来马车以后，巴雷特小姐从沙发上站起来，戴上她的口罩和面纱，下了楼梯。当然，弗拉希也会跟她一起去的。他跳上马车，趴在她的膝盖上。马车是顺着牛津街前行的。繁华伦敦的各种奇观异景令他眼花缭乱，目不暇接。他看见一个完全用玻璃做成的房屋，窗户上装饰着一闪一闪的飘带，屋子里面堆着各种各样散发着紫色、玫瑰色、黄色或粉红色光芒的东西。马车停了下来，弗拉希走进了神秘的拱形游廊，里面被彩云蛛网般的彩色薄纱笼罩着。成千上万种从中国和阿拉伯运来的物品散发出它们各自的香气，飘飘渺渺地钻进了弗拉希感官最深处的神经纤维里。柜台上，一匹匹丝绸不停地闪烁着它们的光芒，至于那些厚重的颜色深沉的邦巴辛毛葛，它们卷动起来就慢多了。剪刀一刻不歇地工作着，硬币散发着耀眼的光芒。用纸包好了，捆上绳子，飘带上下翻飞，翎羽时时颤动，挺直的马匹，黄色的号衣，行人的脸庞，跳跃着，舞动着——弗拉希受到的刺激实在太多了，于是他迷迷糊糊地睡着了，而后发生的一切他都一概不知，直到他被抱出马车，温珀尔大街上的那扇大门在他身后嘎地关上时，他才清醒过来。

第二天的天气还是和昨天一样好，巴雷特小姐进行了一次更胆大的冒险——她坐在轮椅上，来到了温珀尔大街上。弗拉希自然是要跟着她出来的。他第一次听到脚掌与伦敦坚硬的地砖相触碰时所发出的声音，第一次嗅到炎炎夏日伦敦街头的各种气味。他嗅到了水槽里那令人头晕脑胀的气味，嗅到了锈蚀的铁栏杆散发出来的苦涩气味，嗅到了从地下室泛出来的让人迷醉的气味——这些气味比他在雷丁附近的田野间嗅到的气味要复杂得多，污浊得多。这些不同的气味纠缠在一起，人类鼻子的嗅觉已经对此无能为力了。在巴雷特小姐的轮椅向前移动的时候，他一个劲儿地嗅来嗅去，时不时因为吃惊而停下来，在脖子上的项圈被突然拽一下之后，才趔趄着向前行走。他跟在巴雷特小姐的轮椅后面，沿着温珀尔大街小跑着向前走，看着来来往往的行人，他的眼睛应接不暇。他的头顶，有裙子在呼呼响动，他的两肋，被人的裤腿不断摩擦。有的时候，车轮就擦着他的鼻尖儿风一般地疾驰而过。有一次，一辆货车驰过他的身旁，一股破坏力十足的飓风灌入他的耳中，甚至把他脚爪上的毛都给掀了起来，他的耳朵嗡嗡作响，他再次陷入了极度恐惧之中。正当此时，项圈上系着的链条慈悲地将他拽住，巴雷特小姐紧紧地拉住了他，否则它将一头冲出去被车碾死。

最后，他们来到了摄政公园。他激动得每一种感官都在欢呼雀跃，每一根神经都在剧烈跳动。他再一次看见了仿佛已经消失多年的青草、树木、鲜花，从前追赶猎物时发出的欢呼声再一次在他的耳畔响起，他仿佛回到了老家的田野里一样，撒着欢儿向前飞跑，可是，他的喉咙被某一个东西给狠狠地勒住，而后猛地一下，他被拉了回去，蹲在了地上。这里没有树木和青草吗？他问道。难道这些不是自由的信号吗？以前米特福德小姐散步的时候，他不总是会冲在最前面跑跑跳跳吗？为什么来了这里就成了囚犯？他茫然无措了。他注意到，跟老家的鲜花比起来，这里的鲜花长得实在太稠密了，在一块狭小的地皮上，花儿们几乎是肩并肩地挤着。而在这块挤满鲜花的地皮上，又有许多黑色的小径交错纵横，许多戴着夺目礼帽的男人们正在小径上来来往往。一看到他们，他就颤抖起来，更加紧贴轮椅，他们的出现是不祥的征兆。此时，他很乐意接受这条链子的保护。就在最初的这几次散步中，一种新的观念入驻了他的脑海。他把所有的事情都联系起来，然后推导出一个结论：但凡有花园的地方，就一定有沥青路；但凡有花园和沥青路的地方，就一定有戴着亮闪闪的礼帽的男人；而有花园、沥青路和戴着亮闪闪的礼帽的男人的地方，狗就一定要用链子拴起来。所以就算他不认识大门口公告牌上的那些字，可是有关他的那条规定他却悟懂了——摄政公园里，狗一定要用链子拴好。

1842年夏天，弗拉希通过这些奇怪的经历弄懂了知识的这个核心。然后很快他就又悟出了一条道理：狗与狗之间是不平等的，每条狗之间都存在着差异。记得在三里口时，弗拉希与所有的狗都有着不错的关系，无论是酒吧间里的狗，还是当地乡绅的艾斯潘犬，他对他们的态度都是一样的。他不知道补锅匠的狗跟自己有什么不同。的确，他孩子的母亲——虽然出于礼貌我们称她为西班尼尔狗，很有可能是一只杂种狗，她的耳朵属于一个品种，尾巴又属于另一个品种。弗拉希很快便发现，伦敦的狗都是严格划分等级的。有的狗能够随便乱窜，有的狗就必须被铁链拴着；有的狗出来散步是可以乘坐马车的，喝水也是在紫色的罐子里喝，而有的狗没有戴项圈，也无人照料他们，赖以为生的食物都要从臭水沟里翻找。狗与狗是有区别的！有高贵的狗，也有低贱的狗。弗拉希开始怀疑了。温珀尔大街上往来的人们短短的几句话，便使他的这种怀疑得到了证实。“你看见了吗？那个畜生只是一条杂种狗！——噢，上帝呀！真漂亮啊！那条狗是不列颠最好的品种之一，那是一条西班尼尔狗！——稍显不足的是耳朵，要是耳朵能再卷一点就好了。——看，你看那边那条狗，它的枕骨是突出的！”

就是这些零零碎碎的话，和那些或褒奖或嘲笑的语气，令弗拉希在这个夏天结束之前，就在男仆们交头接耳讨论赛马会的酒馆外面，或在邮筒旁边懂得了狗与狗之间是不平等的：有高贵的狗，也有低贱的狗！那他自己属于哪一种呢？回到家后他迫不及待跑到镜子前审视自己，他的头部一点不突出；眼睛大大的，却不显得鼓突；脚掌上覆盖着厚厚的毛——感谢上帝，他是一条血统高贵的狗！他的地位与温珀尔大街上最高贵的科克尔狗不相伯仲！看到给自己喂水的那只紫色罐子，他感到相当满意，因为这是一种特权，只有高贵的狗才有资格享受。他低下头来，乖顺地让链子拴在他的项圈上，这个代价是必须付的，除非他不想当一条高贵的狗。巴雷特小姐却对看着镜子眼睛一眨也不眨的弗拉希产生了误解，以为他是一位正在思考现象与本质的区别的哲学家。显然，事实与猜想截然相反，他是一个贵族，正在思考的是自己有哪些优越的方面。

美妙的夏天眨眼间就结束了。外面刮起了瑟瑟秋风。巴雷特小姐又把自己关在深闺里了，像以前那样过着隐居者的生活。弗拉希的生活也发生了变化。从前在户外所受到的教育，而今在室内得到了进一步的补充。对于有着弗拉希这样性格的一条狗，这无非是所能想象到的情况中最糟糕的。每天，他只能出去散一次步，时间很短，又马马虎虎，并且是由巴雷特小姐的女用威尔逊领着。大部分的时间里，他都只能蜷缩在沙发上，陪伴在巴雷特小姐的脚边。他所有的天赋本能都被压抑、否定了。记得去年刮起秋风的时候，他正在伯克郡的田野里那堆庄稼的茬头上狂奔着。而现在呢？每当常春藤的枝叶刮擦玻璃窗的声音响起，巴雷特小姐就会立马叫来威尔逊，让她把窗户关得严严实实。每当那些栽种在窗台花箱里的龙爪豆和金莲花的叶子枯黄脱落的时候，巴雷特小姐就会将身上那件印度披肩裹得更紧。到了十月份，当窗玻璃上溅开秋雨的时候，威尔逊就会堆一摞高高的煤，然后把火生起来。当秋天尽了，初冬乍到时，几场大雾就把空气搞得像得了黄疸病一般。威尔逊和弗拉希想看清去邮筒，或者去药房的路都十分艰难。当他们回到家后，除了那些立在衣橱顶上闪烁着微亮光芒的惨白胸像，房间里再也看不清其他东西了。看向窗户，遮光窗帘上的城堡与农夫全都不见了，只有漫天昏黄的大雾。弗拉希有种错觉，他与巴雷特小姐正单独处于一个山洞里，里面有火光，地上铺着垫子。外面来来往往的车辆不断传来枯燥而低沉的嗡嗡声，偶尔还会传来几声嘶哑的“修椅子补篮子啰！”还有的时候，一阵刺耳的风琴声会从大街的另一头飘过来，这种声音越来越近，越来越响，然后又越来越远，越来越弱，最终彻底消失。但这些声音中无一意味着自由、玩耍和活动。对于弗拉希而言，除了温暖，安宁，将灯点亮，拉上窗帘和拨弄炭火堆外，什么风啊，雨啊，狂暴的秋日啊，仲冬的寒日啊，都毫无意义了。

这样的日子在刚开始的时候实在是太难熬了。秋天的日子里，弗拉希总是忍不住在房间里蹦来跳去，伴随着阵阵凉风，在田野里庄稼的茬头上肯定会落有鹧鸪。他仿佛听到了从风里边传来的枪声。只要外面一传来狗叫声，他颈上的毛就会自动竖起来，他便会情不自禁地朝门口跑去。但当巴雷特小姐呼唤他回来，用她那双纤细的手掌抚摸他的脖子时，他又抵抗不住另外一种情感的召唤，这种感情是那么急切，并与他的本性相互冲突，令他心烦意乱——他不知道它叫什么，也不明白自己为什么会遵从它的召唤，可是很明显，他被这种感情控制住了。他静静地卧回她的脚边。学会乖顺，学会控制，学会压抑自身那些最强烈的天赋本能——这就是弗拉希在深闺中所受到的教育，这就是他所学习的最基本的课程——就像那些学习希腊语的学者们所遇到的困难一样，这种课程对于弗拉希来说，实在是太艰难了。而他克服这种惊人的困难所经受的痛苦，则远远超过了他们。弗拉希所经受的痛苦是如此之多，某些将军承受的痛苦连这些的一半都不到，就已经在战争中取得了胜利。巴特雷小姐是他的老师。随着时间的推移，弗拉希越来越感觉到他们之间存在一种纽带，一种让人不适但又令人兴奋的紧密联系。他感到，要是他的快乐引起了她的痛苦，那么这种快乐有一多半会变成痛苦，不能再称作是快乐了。这种感觉的真实性每一天都在得到证实。有人打开了门，用口哨唤他出去，他为什么不出去呢？他渴望空气和活动。他的四肢因整天躺在沙发上变得僵硬。他依旧没有习惯科隆香水的气味。但是，不——尽管门开着，他也不愿意离开巴雷特小姐。他犹犹豫豫地走向门口，半路折返，随后躺回了沙发上。“弗拉希，”巴雷特小姐写道，“是我的朋友，我的伴侣，他对我的爱比对外面阳光的爱还要强烈。”她没办法出门。沙发是她的囚牢。“就像一只在鸟笼子里关着的鸟儿一样。”她这样形容自己的生活。对于弗拉希来说，他的世界本该是自由的，可是他却放弃了温珀尔大街上那各种各样的诱人气味，只为了陪伴在她的身边。

他们之间的那条纽带，有时候也会断开，这是因为他们对事物有着各自的理解，而且彼此有着巨大的差别。他们躺在沙发上，茫然不解地相互凝望。巴雷特小姐想知道，为什么弗拉希会突然颤抖起来，竖起耳朵，嘴里呜呜地叫着站起来？她并没有听到任何声音，也没有看到任何东西，房间里除了他们再没了别人。她根本不会猜到，原来是弗莉——她妹妹的小猫刚刚从门口溜达过去了；也或许是那条古巴猎狗卡蒂琳刚在楼下的厨房里，从仆人那里得到了一块羊肉骨头。所有的这一切只有弗拉希自己知道，他能听得到，他被一阵阵情欲和贪欲引诱着。另外，对于弗拉希来说，威尔逊的雨伞又意味着什么呢？巴雷特小姐竭力发挥她的想象力，可仍是猜不出来。她猜不出，原来雨伞令他回忆起了森林、鹦鹉和吼叫的大象。巴雷特小姐也猜想不到，为什么凯尼恩先生被门铃的线绊倒时，他会跑过去咬凯尼恩先生。她猜不到，弗拉希的耳朵里在那时忽然响起了皮肤黝黑的人在山里的呼喝——“西班！西班！”然后那种从祖先那里传承下来却被压抑了太久的狂野驱使他去咬凯尼恩先生。

同样的，巴雷特小姐的情感，也令弗拉希感到疑惑不解。他不明白她为什么总是一连好几小时躺在那里，用一根黑色的小棍子在一张白纸上来来回回地划拉，而有时候她的眼睛里会突然盈满泪水。原来，她是在写信。“哦，亲爱的霍恩先生，我的病情突然恶化……因此，我走投无路，只好到了陌生的托基……这件事对于我来说，将是一生的噩梦，它从我生活中掠走的东西要远多于我在这里所能说的。亲爱的霍恩先生，这件事就忘了它吧，无论到了什么地方都不要再提起它。”是什么让巴雷特小姐流泪呢？房间里没有什么声音，也没有什么气味啊！有时候，巴雷特小姐在舞动手里的那根细棍儿时，又会突然哈哈大笑。实际上，她刚刚画好了“一张非常简洁，颇具特色的弗拉希的画像，简洁明了，手法很幽默，很像我自己。”在肖像画的下面有她的一行题字：“不能算是我自己的肖像画杰作，仅仅因为我把他画得比我高贵了。”巴雷特小姐把画拿到弗拉希面前让他看。他听不到任何声音，也嗅不到任何气味，纸上的这个黑色的斑块到底有什么好笑的？

房间里没有别人，他们无法用言语沟通思想，这无疑导致了他们之间众多的误解。但，也正因为如此，才使得他们之间有了那种奇特的紧密联系。有一次，巴雷特小姐写了一整个下午后，叫道：“写，写，写……”她最终可能会思考，语言和文字真的可以表达一切吗？词语真的能表达某些东西吗？若强行用词语来表达它们力所不及的东西不也是一种破坏吗？最起码，关于这一点，有一次巴雷特小姐好像真的发现了什么。她躺在沙发上冥思的时候，居然完全忘记了弗拉希。她的思绪十分悲伤，以至于她将眼泪滴落到了枕头上。忽然，一个毛茸茸的大脑袋贴近了她，一双明晃晃的大眼睛正注视着她。她居然吃了一惊，弗拉希变成潘神了吗？难道她这个温珀尔大街的病号变成了阿卡迪亚[11]某个幽暗树林中的仙女吗？吻她的这个难道是满脸胡须的畜牧神吗？有一阵她陷入了虚幻的神话中，弗拉希成了潘神，而她成了一名仙女，在风和日丽的天空下，他们燃烧起了炽烈的爱火。但是假如弗拉希会说人类的语言的话——他难道不会对爱尔兰的马铃薯疾病进行一番高谈阔论吗？

同样的，弗拉希也感到身体中产生了一种怪异的冲动。每一次，当他看到巴雷特小姐伸出她那纤弱的手掌，轻轻地从镶有花边的桌子上拿起一个银盒子或者一件珍珠饰品的时候，他那毛茸茸的脚趾就好像收缩了回来。要是自己的爪子能变成十根分离的手指头该多好啊！而当巴雷特小姐用她那幽幽的嗓音念出那么多的音节的时候，他是多么希望自己那粗野的吼叫有一天也能变得像她的声音那样简单，又充满神秘的意义。当她手里夹着一根细棍在纸上不知疲累地写写画画的时候，他又是多么希望自己有一天也能把一张纸抹成黑色，就像她做的那样。

可是，他有可能像她那样书写文字吗？——这个问题实在是乐观过头了，事实逼迫我们不得不做出说明，在1842年和1843年之间，巴雷特小姐只是个病人，没有变成仙女；而弗拉希也仅仅是一条红色的科克尔西班尼尔狗，不是什么诗人；温珀尔大街也只是温珀尔大街，不是阿卡迪亚。

漫长的时间就在这寂静的卧室里悄无声息地消逝了。没有什么能干扰到他们，顶多只是从远处传来的关闭前门的声音，从楼梯上传来的上上下下的脚步声，邮递员叩门的声音，或者扫帚与地板摩擦发出的声音。壁炉里面的煤块伸出它们火红的舌头，发出噼噼啪啪的声音，火光一个劲地闪烁着，映照在五尊白色胸像的额头上，映照在书橱及其上面的红色美利奴精制毛纺纱上。有时，楼梯上的脚步声会在门前停下来，并不总是从门外经过，之后门把手转动，门就打开了，有人走了进来。接着，屋里所有的家具都变换了模样！房间里立刻回旋起迥乎寻常的气味和声音的旋涡，它们席卷着桌腿，撞击着衣橱那尖锐的棱角。进入屋里的人，可能是端着一盘饭菜或一杯药水的威尔逊，也可能是巴雷特小姐的两个妹妹之一——阿莱贝拉或亨利艾塔，还可能是巴雷特小姐的七个弟弟之一——查尔斯、萨缪尔、乔治、亨利、阿尔弗雷德、塞普蒂默斯或奥古特维亚斯。每一周都免不了有那么一两次让弗拉希感到像是有某件极其重要的事情要发生了。比如卧床被细致地装点了一番，变成了一张沙发；在沙发旁边放上了一把从边上搬过来的扶手椅；巴雷特小姐在身上裹上了一件得体的印度披肩；盥洗用品被小心翼翼地藏到了乔叟[12]和荷马的胸像下面；弗拉希也被梳洗打扮了一番，变得干干净净。大约下午两三点钟时，就会有一阵很特别的、很有特色的、清晰的敲门声响起。这时候，巴雷特小姐会红着脸，面带微笑地伸出她的手。走进来的人也许是亲爱的米特福德小姐，她手里捧着一束天竺葵，脸蛋红扑扑的，会唠唠叨叨地说上一阵。也可能是矮墩墩胖乎乎的凯尼恩先生，这是一位已上了年纪的绅士，衣着打扮非常整洁，他带着一本书，浑身上下都洋溢着一种慈爱的光辉。还可能是詹姆森太太，与凯尼恩先生的形象截然相反，她是一个“脸色苍白，面容憔悴，眼睛清澈，薄薄的嘴唇没有血色，鹰钩鼻子，下巴又尖又细”的女人。来这里的任何一位客人都有着自己的独特风格，以及气味、声音和腔调。米特福德小姐说起话来唠唠叨叨，虽然有点口不择言，不过所有的话里没有一句是空话、假话或套话。凯尼恩先生是个特别有涵养的人，对礼节十分注重，因为有两颗门牙掉了，所以有时候说话会让人听不太清楚。詹姆森夫人所有的牙都长得好好的，一说起话来，那张嘴就会飞快而又精准地颤动着。

他们谈话的时候，话音会像涟漪一样在弗拉希的耳边荡来荡去，弗拉希会一连好几个小时蜷缩在巴雷特小姐的脚边。在谈话的过程中，巴雷特小姐有时开怀大笑，有时发出惊呼，有时叹息，有时告诫几句，有时又笑起来。最后，他们都安静下来了，就连米特福德小姐那张喋喋不休的嘴也沉默了。弗拉希总算大松一口气。难道已经七点钟了吗？打从中午开始她就一直在这儿，现在想赶火车必须得跑着去了吧？一直在朗读的凯尼恩先生也会把书本合上，背向炉火站起身来。詹姆森夫人则会朝一根根手指上套她的手套，那动作飞快而又笨拙。弗拉希有时候会被他们拍拍脑袋，有时候会被他们拉拉耳朵。告辞的那一套过场实在令人忍无可忍。好在，詹姆森夫人，或凯尼恩先生，或米特福德小姐都站了起来，说了再见。想起了什么东西，落下了什么东西，又找到了什么东西，走到门口把门打开，总算是走了，谢天谢地！

巴雷特小姐躺回枕头上，她面色苍白，一脸疲惫。弗拉希挨近她。谢天谢地，他们终于又能独处了。不过客人待得时间太长了，已经快到晚餐时间了。这时候从楼下的厨房里飘上来各种各样的气味。威尔逊也来到了门口，端着一个托盘，上面放着巴雷特小姐的晚餐。她把托盘放到巴雷特小姐身边的桌子上，揭开碗碟上的盖子。可是巴雷特小姐吃不下任何东西。因为穿衣化妆、在那么热的房间里谈了那么长时间的话，告别的时候心情又太激动，所以她现在特别的疲惫。鸡翅，鹧鸪翅，还有肥羊排，她看了眼晚餐的食物，轻轻地叹了一口气。假如威尔逊在房间里，她就拿着刀叉，百无聊赖地拨弄着那些食物，只要威尔逊一离开，她就立马打个手势，然后举起手中叉着一块鸡翅的叉子。弗拉希就会凑上去。巴雷特小姐点点头，他就灵巧地，轻轻松松地从叉子上把那块鸡翅咬下来，一丁点肉沫儿都不会浪费。当这块鸡翅被他毁尸灭迹后，那块上面抹着厚厚奶油的米布丁也会被他用同样的方法消灭掉。弗拉希配合得非常干净漂亮，而且十分实在，其他任何人都比不了。接下来他就会像平常那样，卧回巴雷特小姐的脚边，蜷缩起身子，像是睡着了一样。巴雷特小姐，也会做出一副刚刚享受完美味晚餐的样子，躺下来打个盹儿。这时候，楼梯上会响起一阵任何人都不可比拟的沉重的、坚定的、谨慎的脚步声，最后在门外停下来。敲门声响了起来，庄严而肃穆。这绝不是在询问能否进来，而是在命令别人把门打开。门开了，一个皮肤比任何人都黝黑，样貌比任何人都凶狠的老男人走了进来。这就是巴雷特先生本人。他的眼睛马上就扫向托盘，吃过晚饭了吗？他的命令被执行了吗？嗯，盘子是空的。巴雷特先生弯下身板，在她身边的椅子上重重地坐下来，以此表示对女儿的温柔和褒奖。弗拉希看到那个黑黝黝的身躯挨得自己那么近，他的后背一阵战栗，他感到极度恐惧。他的样子就像一个蹲伏在鲜花丛中的野蛮人。那个声音就像是上帝发出的一样，像天空上炸响的怒雷，弗拉希害怕得浑身发抖。这时候，外面传来威尔逊的口哨声，他如蒙大赦，立即心虚地逃了出去，仿佛巴雷特先生有那种本领，能够看穿他的心思，而他的思想中又藏着某种罪恶一样。他一逃出房门，就急匆匆地向楼下跑去。进入房间的那种力量，令他感到心惊胆战，完全无力抗衡。有一回，人们没有提防他，被他溜进了房间，他看见了巴雷特先生正跪在他女儿身边祈祷。





第三章　戴风帽的人


在温珀尔大街后部的卧室中经受了这种教育后，即便是普通的狗也会受到影响，何况弗拉希不是一条普通的狗。弗拉希十分好动，但也勤于思考。他是一条极通人性的狗。那间卧室的气氛有一种奇特的力量在影响着他。如果他作为狗的天性被削弱了，那也不是他的错，只不过他受到了那种情感的驯化。他将头枕在一本希腊语词典上，他变得不再喜欢咬人，也不喜欢吠叫，不喜欢狗的狂野；他越来越喜欢兔子的宁静，喜欢人类的抚摸，这是很自然的转变。巴雷特小姐也全力教育他，好让他变得更加高雅。她从窗台边上拿起一架竖琴，放在弗拉希身旁，问他是不是觉得因为竖琴能够奏出音乐，所以它就是有生命的。起初他非常疑惑，他瞅着，听着，思索着，最后终于有了判断——它没有。她又陪着他一起站在镜子跟前，而后问他为什么要发抖，为什么要吠叫。对面的那条棕色的小狗，不正是他自己吗？弗拉希也在思索另一个问题：“自己”又是什么呢？是那东西本身呢，还是人们见到的东西呢？他解答不了这些现实的问题，于是他更加亲密地贴在巴雷特小姐身边，“带着丰富的表情”舔着她的腿，至少巴雷特小姐是真实的。

从诸如此类的问题中挣扎出来，带着撼动他的神经系统的令他困扰的情感，弗拉希走下了楼，如果当他因他的行为举止中有什么——些微的目空一切，不可一世——激怒了粗野的古巴猎狗卡蒂琳，在那条猎狗扑上来，撕咬他时，他哀嚎着逃回楼上，去寻求巴雷特小姐的庇护的话，我们应该对此不足为奇。弗拉希“绝对不是一个英雄”，巴雷特小姐得出这样的结论。是什么原因剥夺了他当一个英雄的资格呢？难道她不需要为此负大半责任吗？她是一个公正的人，所以她马上就明白过来，弗拉希是为了她抛弃了自己的勇敢，正如他为了她舍弃了新鲜的空气和阳光一样。这种敏感、易激动的性格无疑是有弊端的——当弗拉希扑向被门铃的拉绳绊倒的凯尼恩先生，并对其猛咬一口时，她必须要连声道歉；当弗拉希因不允许睡在她的床上而整夜哀嚎时——当弗拉希一定要她亲自喂食，否则就不吃东西时，她虽然恼怒，但即便如此，她还是忍住了没有责怪弗拉希，毕竟这一切都是因为弗拉希爱她。他为了她已经舍弃了阳光和空气。她跟霍恩先生说：“他是一条值得喜爱的狗，不是吗？”但无论霍恩先生作何回答，在巴雷特小姐心中都早已有了定论。她爱弗拉希，而弗拉希也配得上她的喜爱。所以无论霍恩先生是如何回答的，都已经无所谓了。

随着时间的推移，他们的这种关系越来越牢固，越来越亲密，仿佛这个世界上没有任何东西能够破坏他们之间的这种关系，仿佛他们的全部生命也将这样度过。1842年、1843年、1844年逐一过去了，他们迎来了1845年。弗拉希不再是一条小狗了，他已经四五岁大，步入成年了。没有变化的是，巴雷特小姐仍旧躺在温珀尔大街卧室的沙发上，而弗拉希也仍旧陪伴在她的脚边。巴雷特小姐的生活宛如“一只关在笼中的鸟儿”。有时候，她将自己禁足在卧室里一连好几个星期。就算偶尔出去转转，也要么是坐着马车去商店里购物，要么是让人推着她的轮椅，去摄政公园里溜达一圈，但时间都不会太久，顶多一两个小时。巴雷特家族的成员从来都没有离开过伦敦。巴雷特先生、巴雷特小姐、她的七个弟弟、她的两个妹妹、管家、威尔逊、女用、猎狗卡蒂琳、小猫弗莉还有弗拉希，从年初到年尾一直都生活在温珀尔大街50号。他们做饭在厨房里，吃饭在餐厅里，睡觉在卧室里，抽烟在书房里。把热水提进去，把脏水倒出来。地毯有些旧了，椅套有些脏了。在家具的缝隙里，在画框的顶上，在雕刻物的旋涡状装饰图形里和丝织品里，煤灰、烟尘、软泥、雾气、酒气、雪茄的烟气还有肉渣在一个劲地聚集着。常春藤在巴雷特小姐卧室的窗户外越长越稠密，这绿色的窗帘变得越来越厚实，夏天，窗台花箱里的龙爪豆和金莲花也越长越旺盛。

但在1845年1月初的某个晚上，邮递员敲响了门。他一如既往地把信件塞进信箱里。威尔逊也一如既往地下楼取信。所有的事都一如往常——每天晚上邮递员都会来敲门，每天晚上威尔逊都会去取信，每天晚上都会有一封信是给巴雷特小姐的，但是今晚的这封信却不同以往。弗拉希看出来了，在信封被拆开之前，他就看出来了。他从巴雷特小姐拿到信后，翻来覆去地察看那信封上书写她名字的苍劲有力、参差不齐的字体时的样子判断了出来。他从她那莫名颤抖的手指，从她那迫不及待拆开信封的动作，从她那读完信后怔怔出神的表情判断了出来。他凝望着她读信的样子，聆听着她读信的声音，就像我们在半睡半醒时，听见喧嚣的街市上传来一阵铃音，并且深知它是在召唤我们，令人担忧但又十分微弱，就好像是有人正在远处设法唤醒我们，告诉我们发生了火灾，或者盗窃，或者其他什么会威胁到我们安危的事件，于是我们半睡半醒之中一跃而起——所以当巴雷特小姐阅读那封涂满墨迹的信时，弗拉希也听到了那阵睡梦中警醒他的铃音，铃音告诉他，有一种危险正在临近，他不能再睡了。巴雷特小姐很快就把信看了一遍，然后放慢速度又细细地看了一遍，最后把信纸放回信封里。她也无法入睡了。

不久后的一个晚上，同样的信再次出现在了威尔逊的托盘里。巴雷特小姐依然是先飞快地读完一遍，然后再放慢速度细细地品读一遍，然后再反反复复地阅读许多遍。而后这封信并没有同米特福德小姐的众多来信一起被放进抽屉，而是被小心翼翼地单独存放在另外的某个地方。弗拉希能够嗅到别人无法察觉的痕迹，毕竟在这几年漫长的时间里，他都陪伴在巴雷特小姐的脚边，所累积的敏锐非比寻常。巴雷特小姐抚摸他的时候，他能从她的手指上感觉出她所期待的只有一件事——邮递员的敲门声，以及躺在威尔逊的托盘里的信函。巴雷特小姐会在轻轻地、极有韵律地拍打他的时候——突然急促地敲击起来——她的手指攥紧了，弗拉希立时会觉得自己好像被老虎钳夹住一样，而这时楼梯上会响起威尔逊的脚步声。她把信接到手里，就会松开他，把他忘到一边。

不过，弗拉希依旧在争辩，既然巴雷特小姐的生活没有发生什么变化，那么他又有什么好担心的呢？巴雷特小姐的生活确实一如往昔，没有一个陌生面孔前来。凯尼恩先生像往常一样来访；米特福德小姐也一如既往地来拜访；兄弟姐妹们也照常探望；晚上，巴雷特先生也会来。他们什么也没有发现，什么也不怀疑。所以当有时那种信连续几天都不出现时，弗拉希便宽慰自己，让自己相信敌人已经离开了。在他的想象中，肯定有一个戴着风帽、裹着头巾、披着斗篷、像个窃贼一样的男人来到这里并摇响了门铃，但发现有人在门口守卫着，所以他只能灰头土脸地偷偷离开。那个人已经离去了，已经不存在威胁了，弗拉希努力让自己相信这些。然而，那种信又来了。

随着那样的来信越来越频繁，弗拉希开始察觉到巴雷特小姐本身也在日渐产生变化。弗拉希生平第一次见到她坐卧不宁、焦躁不安的样子。她没有心思读书，没有心思写作，常常站在窗口凝望外面。另外，她还非常着急地询问威尔逊天气如何——东风有没有停？摄政公园里是不是春暖花开了？哦，没有，威尔逊回答说，寒冷的东风还在刮着。这时弗拉希感觉，巴雷特小姐立马像是舒了一口气，不过又显得很不高兴。她一边咳嗽，一边抱怨说自己身体不舒服——不过比刮东风的时候稍微好点了。然后当她一个人的时候，她会把前一天晚上收到的信再拿出来细细品味。这封信是目前为止她所收到的最长的来信，厚厚的信纸上密布着黑色墨迹写的复杂难懂的象形文字。待在巴雷特小姐脚边的弗拉希只能看到这些，但他完全无法理解巴雷特小姐嘴里那些呢呢喃喃的话语。他只能感受到当她读完信纸最后一行时内心的激动。她大声念道（虽然弗拉希听不懂）：“你觉得我是应该再过两个月来看望你，还是三个月呢？”

然后她就拿起笔，满怀激动地在一张张信纸上奋笔疾书。但巴雷特小姐所写的这些词语，它们意味着什么呢？“四月即将来临。还有五月和六月，只要我们还活着。无论如何，或许我们能够……等到天气转暖，我的气力恢复些的时候，我一定会跟你见一面……不过起初你确实让我感到害怕——虽然我现在写这些话的时候并没有那样的感觉。你就像帕拉塞尔萨斯[13]，而我只是一个把自己关在深闺中的病号，像是一个服刑者，我的神经纤维都已经断裂，正散乱地悬着，我每前进一步，每呼吸一口空气，它们都会颤抖。”

弗拉希无法阅读她正在他头顶上方书写的那些东西，但是他又好像能够读懂每一个词语一样，十分清楚自己的女主人在写信的时候有多么非比寻常地激动难耐，也知道有怎样彼此冲突的欲望在撼动着她的心灵——或许四月会来到；或许四月不会来到；她要马上跟这位陌生人相见；她永远不会跟这个陌生人相见。只要一听到脚步声或者呼吸声响起，弗拉希就会跟着她一起颤抖。时间飞快地流逝，暖酥酥的风儿终将窗帘掀开，把阳光送进了屋里，照亮了那些胸像。不知是什么地方，有一只小鸟儿啁啾鸣啭。卖花人的叫卖声从楼下的温珀尔大街飘了进来。他知道，所有的这些声音都意味着四月即将到来，五月和六月也近了——什么也无法阻止那令人厌恶的春天的到来。如果春天到了，伴随着它来到这里的又会是什么？是一种可怖的东西，一种令人害怕的东西！这种东西令弗拉希感到无比害怕，因为巴雷特小姐害怕它。一阵脚步声从楼梯上传来，那声音把他吓了一跳，还好那只是亨利艾塔。一阵敲门声从外面传来，又把他吓坏了，还好那只是凯尼恩先生。四月份，以及五月份的前二十天，就在这样的气氛中过去了，五月二十一日那天，弗拉希知道，这一天终于来临了。五月二十一日，星期二，这一天巴雷特小姐在镜子里认认真真地打量着自己，披上自己的印度披肩，打扮得又漂亮又高雅。她吩咐威尔逊把扶手椅拉到离沙发不远不近的地方。摸摸这里，摸摸那里，而后背靠枕头，坐得笔直。弗拉希紧张地蹲在她的脚边。他们等待着，一起等待着。马里尔伯恩教堂的钟响了两下，他们依然在等待。马里尔伯恩教堂的钟又响了一下，两点半了——两点半的钟声刚刚停歇，一阵果断而勇敢的敲门声就从前门那边传了进来，巴雷特小姐的脸刷一下就白了。她一动不动，一声不响，在那里躺着。弗拉希也一声不吭，安安静静地卧在那里。那脚步声冲着楼上来了，听起来那么可怕，那么冷酷。弗拉希知道，半夜里出现的那个不祥的影子，那个戴着风帽、裹着头巾的人朝着楼上走来了，而且他已经把手放在了门上——门把手转动了，他的身影出现在了门口。

“勃朗宁先生来了！”威尔逊开口说道。

弗拉希凝望着巴雷特小姐，她的双颊飞上了一层红晕，她的那双眼睛格外明亮，她的嘴唇张开了，她叫道：“勃朗宁先生！”

勃朗宁先生手中扭扯着他的黄手套，眼睛眨动着，他的衣着干净整洁，仪表堂堂，姿态豪放不羁。他大步走来，握住巴雷特小姐的手，并在她旁边的椅子上坐下来。他们立即开始了谈话。

当他们谈话时，一种可怕的孤独朝弗拉希袭来。他以前的感觉是，自己和巴雷特小姐住在一个山洞里，山洞里有明亮的火光。现在火光消失了，山洞变得又阴暗又潮湿，巴雷特小姐走出了山洞。他看了看自己的周围，所有的一切都不复原样了。那个书架，那五个立在高处的胸像都变得陌生、狰狞起来，再也不是和善可亲的神了。待在巴雷特小姐脚边的他动了动，可是巴雷特小姐一点也没有注意到，他感到无比委屈，发出自己的呜咽声，可是他们还是一点也没听见。最后痛苦不堪的他躺在那里一动不动，不再出声。他们的谈话继续进行着，语调不像往常的谈话那样连贯、平稳，只偶尔有一些起伏，它跌跌宕宕，有时忽然停住，有时又忽然起来。巴雷特小姐现在的这种声音，弗拉希以前从来也没有听到过。她的声音是那么富有生气，那么激动澎湃。还有她容光焕发的面颊，神采奕奕的大眼睛，他以前也从来没有看到过。钟声响了四下，他们依旧在谈话。当四点半的钟声敲响后，勃朗宁先生突然蹦起来。他的每一个动作都是那么果决、勇敢，那么令人厌恶、令人害怕。他跟巴雷特小姐握了握手，戴上手套和帽子，跟巴雷特小姐说了再见，这一系列动作眨眼间就完成了。他们听着他下楼的声音，然后门轻快地关上了，他离去了。

以往，每当凯尼恩先生或米特福德小姐告辞后，巴雷特小姐就会躺回枕头上，可这一次她没有。现在她依然端端正正地坐着。脸颊上的红晕依旧在泛光，眼睛中依旧有火焰在燃烧，她似乎感觉勃朗宁先生依旧跟她在一起。直到弗拉希碰了碰她，她才像是受到惊吓一样，想起他来。她微笑着，在他的头上拍了拍，一脸的喜悦。她用一种很奇怪的目光看着他，就好像希望他能说话一样——就好像她希望能跟他分享她此刻的心情一样。接着，她又笑了，笑容里带着一种怜悯，似乎她觉得这种想法有些荒谬。弗拉希，可怜的弗拉希，感受不到她所感受的，也明白不了她所明白的。这是一片以前从未出现过的悲凉荒漠，它横亘在了他们中间。虽然他还是躺在那里，可是没有得到任何关注。他觉得，或许他躺在这里已然是个错误，她已经把他给遗忘了。

当天晚上，她把所有的鸡肉都吃完了，连一点土豆片、土豆渣都没有扔给弗拉希。像平常一样，巴雷特先生进来看他的女儿，他在那个人坐过的椅子上坐下了，把头靠在了那个人靠过的垫子上，弗拉希感到十分惊疑，他怎么会这么迟钝，难道他什么也觉察不到吗？“你闻不到他的气味吗？”弗拉希惊诧地想，“有人在那个椅子上坐过，难道你一点也感觉不到吗？”于弗拉希而言，整间房子里都充斥着勃朗宁先生的气味。空气裹着这种气味从书架上流窜过去，又在五个胸像的头顶上绕着圈圈。可是这个身体笨重的人沉浸在自己的思想中，虽然坐在女儿的身旁，却什么都没有注意到，一点疑心都没有生起。他的迟钝令弗拉希感到震惊。弗拉希悄悄地从他的身边走过去，出了房门。

尽管他们迟钝地令人震惊，但几个星期以后，巴雷特家族的成员们也开始注意到了巴雷特小姐身上的变化。她开始离开自己的卧室，到楼下的客厅里坐着。然后她又做了一件很久都没有做过的事情，她用自己的脚，陪着妹妹一直走到了德文郡别墅的大门。这样的进步令他的家人和朋友们都感到惊讶。这种力量的源泉，只有弗拉希知根知底，是那个坐在扶手椅上的皮肤黑黝黝的男人给她的。他接二连三地来这里造访，起初只是每星期来一次，后来每星期来两次。下午来，下午走。每次他来，巴雷特小姐都会单独会见他。就算是那些他不来的日子，也总会有他的信件被送来。屋子里现在还留着他带来的鲜花。上午的时候，如果屋子里只有巴雷特小姐一个人，她就会写信给他。那个皮肤黝黑，脸蛋红润，一头黑发，衣饰整洁，精力旺盛，动作粗犷，手上戴一副黄手套的男人——到处都是他的身影。巴雷特小姐的身体逐渐好了起来。她能够走路了，弗拉希当然也不愿再躺着了。他陷入了新的躁动和不安中，从前的欲望又复苏了！他睡觉的时候，总是不停地做梦。他梦到了自从离开三里口后就再也没有梦到过的那些事物——野兔从深草丛中忽然蹿出来；长着长长的尾翎的野鸡像箭一般嗖地一下飞上天空；鹧鸪呼地一下从收割过的庄稼地里飞过；他梦见自己正在追赶一条西班尼尔狗，那条狗浑身斑斑点点，在前面亡命奔逃，最终逃脱了他的追猎。他梦见自己在西班牙，在威尔士，在伯克郡；他梦见自己奔跑在摄政公园里，后面有守园人拿着一根短棍追赶他。他一睁眼，兔子消失了，鹧鸪消失了，挥动的皮鞭也消失了，呼喝着“西班！西班！”的皮肤黝黑的人们也消失了。只有勃朗宁先生坐在扶手椅上，正和沙发上的巴雷特小姐聊天。

只要有这个男人在这儿，他就不可能睡得着。弗拉希躺在那里，瞪着他的大眼睛，听着他们的谈话。尽管他听不懂这些有时候每个星期三次从两点半到四点半在他头顶盘旋的谈话，但他能清晰地判断出他们谈话的语调在发生变化。刚开始时，巴雷特小姐的声音像是从嘴里硬挤出来的一样，虽然饱含生机，可是一点也不自然。而现在，她的声音里出现了一种热情和自在，这是他从未听到过的。她的声音总会在那个人每来一次后就增添一些新的东西——有时候，他们只是奇怪地闲聊着；有时候，他们会像一群掠过他的头顶，自由自在飞翔在天空中的鸟儿一样；有时候，他们咕咕咯咯地叫着，就好像他们是鸟窝中的两只小鸟；然后巴雷特小姐的声音就会变得更加响亮，像盘旋在空中一样，久久不落；再然后，勃朗宁先生的朗笑声就会响起，听起来格外嘶哑，刺耳；最后，他们俩的声音就会融合在一起，像是一阵宁静的嗡嗡声，弗拉希听到的只是他们的窃窃私语。夏去秋来，弗拉希凭着他那惊人的洞察力留意到了，他们的声音里又有了新的语调。有一种新的活力、压力和殷切的味道出现在了那个男人的声音里，而巴雷特小姐的声音里则多了一种战栗和犹豫的味道，弗拉希对此的认知是，巴雷特小姐在害怕什么。她的声音越来越弱，支支吾吾的，似乎在恳求，恳求停止什么，好让她休息一下，她在喘息，看起来她特别害怕。然后那个男人就陷入了沉默中。

他们根本就不会在意他。在勃朗宁先生的眼里，他或许就是一根躺在巴雷特小姐脚边的木头。勃朗宁先生在经过他的身边时，有时也会伸手摸摸他的脑袋，不过动作非常暴躁，力道过猛，就跟抽筋一样，里面不包含一丁点感情。无论他的这种抚摸代表的真正意思是什么，都只是引起了弗拉希的强烈反感。当勃朗宁先生穿着那身裁剪得极为合体，能够把他发达的肌肉绷得紧紧的衣服时，当他用双手扭扯着那双黄手套时，他都感觉自己的牙根在发痒，让他有种想要扑上去咬他几口的冲动。总而言之，1845年到1846年的这个冬天，在这段时光里，弗拉希感受到了前所未有的痛苦。

冬去春来。弗拉希怀疑自己的苦难永远不会有结束之日了。这样的日子就像一条倒映出岸上宁静的树林、飞回树梢的乌鸦和吃草的牛群的小河，谁也无法阻止它向着飞流直下的瀑布流淌而去。所以，弗拉希知道，这样的日子，其结局只会是一场灾难。空气中弥漫着即将发生大改变的气息。有时他觉得一次大规模的迁徙将要发生。整个家里都有一种说不上来的纷乱，就像是出门旅行前——这可能吗？——那种乱哄哄的情景。箱子上的灰尘被打扫得干干净净，并难以置信地全都打开了，接着又被关上了。不，不是全家都要迁徙。她的弟弟妹妹们还是像往常一样来探望她，每天晚上，那个人离去后，巴雷特先生会在他所习惯的那个时间来看望他的女儿。可是，到底会发生什么样的事呢？1846年的夏天也一天天过去了，弗拉希断定他们的生活即将发生变化。他再一次从在他头顶进行的没完没了的谈话的声调变化中品味了出来。巴雷特小姐原本害怕、恳求的声音如今不再颤抖了。从她现在的声音里，弗拉希听到了一种她从未有过的果决和勇敢。要是巴雷特先生能够听到她在迎接那个篡权者时说话的声调，她在问候他时的笑声，以及他握着她的手时她发出的喜悦的惊呼就好了！可惜，这个屋子里除了弗拉希，就只剩下他俩了。弗拉希为巴雷特小姐的变化而感到异常恼怒，这不仅仅是因为巴雷特小姐与勃朗宁先生的关系一天比一天好，还因为她和其他人的关系包括她对弗拉希的感情在内，也都在一天天地发生着变化。她态度粗暴地对待他的撒娇和好动，她笑着打断他所做的那些亲昵的动作；她让他觉得他原本的那一套表达亲热的方式变得小气、愚蠢、做作，且毫无意义。他的虚荣心被刺痛了，妒火在他心中熊熊燃起。最终，等到七月来临的时候，他决定采取一次暴力行动，以夺回他失去的宠爱，没准还能赶走那个新来的家伙。他不会制订什么计划，也不知道该怎么做才能一箭双雕。不过在七月八号那天，他突然就被自己的情感支配了，他一下子扑到了勃朗宁先生的身上，死命地咬他。勃朗宁先生那整洁干净的裤子被他的牙齿咬透了，可是裤子里的这条腿却跟钢铁一样坚硬——凯尼恩先生的那条腿跟他的一比，简直就像松软的黄油。勃朗宁先生只是轻松地将手臂一挥，就把弗拉希拨到了一边，然后若无其事地继续谈话。对于他的这次袭击，巴雷特小姐和勃朗宁先生给予了一致的态度——不屑一顾。弗拉希失败了，他彻底没辙了。他唯一能做的，就是大喘着粗气，带着满腔的怒火和失落躺回垫子上。可是他低估了巴雷特小姐的洞察力。等勃朗宁先生离开后，巴雷特小姐将他叫了过去，前所未有地给予了他一顿最严厉的惩罚。首先她打他的耳朵——这不算什么，而且虽然很奇怪，不过她打他的耳朵时，他感到很高兴，还希望她再多打一下呢。但接着她用严肃、坚定地语气说了一句话，她说她再也不会爱他了。这句话就像一支利箭刺穿了他的心脏。这些年来，他一直跟她生活在一起，无论是什么都会一起分享，可是现在她却因为他的一次小小的过错就再也不爱他了。接着，似乎是要让这个打击变得更加彻底一些，她把勃朗宁先生送给她的鲜花插进了一个装满水的花瓶里。在弗拉希的眼里，这是一种经过认真思考后故意做出的敌意行为。巴雷特小姐的目的是，叫他彻彻底底认识到自己无足轻重。她就像是在说：“这株玫瑰，还有这株石竹，都是他带来的。就让这红色和黄色的花儿竞相争艳吧。而这些绿叶就插在这里作为这些鲜活的陪衬吧……”她插好所有的花枝后，就站到一旁认真地端详起面前的这一大束娇艳的鲜花，就好像那个戴着黄手套的男人就站在她面前一样。不过就算是这样，在她捣鼓那些鲜花和绿叶的时候，她也无法忽视弗拉希怔怔盯着她的目光。她无法否认“他脸上的表情带着一种绝望”。她心软了。“最后我说：‘弗拉希，要是你真的听话，你就过来说声对不起。’听到这话，他一下就跑了过来。我见他浑身都在颤抖，一个劲地吻着我的手，在两只手上交替地吻着。他还把自己的前爪抬起来，想要我跟他握一握。他看着我的眼神是那么的楚楚可怜，你也一定会像我一样原谅他的过错。”她向勃朗宁先生讲这件事的时候就是这么说的。“哦，可怜的弗拉希！”他的回答当然是这样的。“莫非你觉得我会因他的监督而心生嫉妒，然后就不爱他，不尊重他了吗？你觉得他认识了你之后，就不能在短时间里再接纳另一个人吗？”勃朗宁先生用一种毫不在乎的态度宽容了他，可是这种宽容就像锋锐的蒺藜一样，刺进了弗拉希的身体中。

没过几天，又发生了另一件事，而这件事更加突显了巴雷特小姐与弗拉希之间的裂痕有多么深。从前他们的心明明是紧紧连在一起的，可现在他几乎不能指望从巴雷特小姐那里获取任何同情。有一天下午，巴雷特小姐在勃朗宁先生离开后，打算坐车跟妹妹一起去摄政公园。当她们在公园门口下车的时候，弗拉希的爪子被四轮马车的门给夹住了。他“凄惨地呜咽着”，试图博得巴雷特小姐的怜悯，抬起爪子给巴雷特小姐看。要是以前发生这种情况，就算是远比这轻得多的伤痛，巴雷特小姐也会给予极大的同情，可是这次他从她的眼睛里看到的却只是戏谑和挑衅，还有漠不关心。她怀疑他在假装，她在嘲笑他。她写道：“……他脚一沾草地，就把刚才这事儿忘得一干二净了，可了劲地撒欢儿奔跑。”然后她又讽刺性地评说道：“弗拉希会最大限度地利用自己的不幸——他是拜伦派的——摆出一副受害者的模样。”可是这一次巴雷特小姐误会了弗拉希，她只沉浸在自己的感情海洋里，不知道就算他的脚爪折断了，他还是会蹦跳着跑开的。他的奔跑是一种回答，针对她的嘲讽，他说，我跟你断绝关系了——他在奔跑时回头看了她一眼，所表达的就是这个意思。他的脚掌被草叶扎得生痛，他的鼻孔里钻进了灰尘，花儿的芬芳杳无踪影，他失望了。他就那样奔跑着，跳跃着。他又看见了那块牌子——“狗一定得拴上铁链”。那些头上戴着礼帽，手里持着短棍的护园者四处巡查，这句话被一遍遍地强调着。可是对他来说，“一定”这个词已经失去任何意义了。他现在可以随便乱跑了，跑到哪儿都行，因为爱的锁链已经断了。就让那些护园者挥动他们的短棍吧。他要去追赶西班尼尔狗，他要追猎那些鹧鸪，他还要跳到大丽菊花坛的中间，把那些红色的黄色的所有鲜艳耀眼的玫瑰都踩断。就让他们打碎他的脑袋吧，如果他们愿意，也可以把他的内脏掏空，让他在巴雷特小姐的脚边死去。他什么也不在乎了。可实际上，这些情况一样都没有发生，根本没有人来追赶他，甚至没有人多看他一眼。那个寂寞的护园者正在和一个年轻的保姆聊天。最后，他又回到巴雷特小姐的身边，而她漫不经心地把铁链套在他的脖子上，把他领回了家。

两次遭遇到这样的屈辱，就算是一条普通的狗，甚至是一个平常的人，他们的精神都会支离破碎。弗拉希尽管是一条驯服、温顺的狗，但他的眼睛里也喷出了怒火。他的愤怒不仅仅会如同烈火一般熊熊燃烧，还会在心里不断沉淀，只要等到某个时机，就会汹涌喷发。他做出了一个决定，要跟敌人来一次单对单、面对面的较量，只有他们两个对决者，决不让第三者来插手这场终极决战。七月二十一日，又是一个星期二，这天下午他悄无声息地跑下楼，在客厅里等待着。他没有让他久等，不久他便听见了那熟悉的脚步声在大街上响起，听见了那熟悉的敲门声，勃朗宁先生进来了。他的手里提着一盒蛋糕，他似乎清楚弗拉希准备袭击他，所以打算采取一种最为温和的方式来解决这件事。当勃朗宁先生看见待在客厅里的弗拉希后，他表现出一副想要摸摸他的样子，友善地伸出手来，可能他还打算让他吃蛋糕呢。但是那个动作已经足够了。勇猛的弗拉希以不可思议的速度朝着敌人扑去。他的牙齿第二次把勃朗宁先生的裤子咬透。可是怒气冲顶的他忘记了一件很重要的事——保持缄默，他居然狂吠起来。他一边怒冲冲地大声吼叫，一边朝着勃朗宁先生狂扑过去。显而易见，他的吠叫声把家里所有的人都惊动了。威尔逊一溜小跑，从楼上跑下来，把弗拉希狠狠地修理了一顿，把他彻底制伏了。他在屈辱中被威尔逊拖走了。这简直是莫大的耻辱——他对勃朗宁先生发动的攻击没有成功不说，还反过来被威尔逊狠狠教训了一顿。勃朗宁先生甚至连一根手指都没有动。他丝毫无碍，非常镇定，像是什么事情都没有发生过一样，带着他的蛋糕一个人上楼去了，进入了那间卧室。可是弗拉希却被带走了。

在被软禁于厨房，同鹦鹉、甲虫、蕨类植物和炖锅一起熬过了痛苦的两个半小时后，弗拉希被带到了巴雷特小姐面前。她正躺在沙发上，她的妹妹阿莱贝拉就坐在她旁边。弗拉希相信正义是站在自己这边的，他高昂着头颅走到巴雷特小姐跟前。可是她根本不正眼瞧他。于是他将目光转向阿莱贝拉。她只说了一句：“弗拉希你这个捣蛋鬼，一边儿去！”威尔逊——那个出手狠辣、令他畏惧的威尔逊也在这里。巴雷特小姐把身子转过来，询问了威尔逊事情的经过。威尔逊说她打了弗拉希，“因为该打”，然后她又补充说，她只是用手打了他。因为有威尔逊的证词在这儿，弗拉希自然被判定为有罪了。巴雷特小姐做出裁断：勃朗宁先生并没有招惹弗拉希，而弗拉希毫无道理地对他发动了攻击。她相信勃朗宁先生是一个心胸宽广的人，人类所有的美德都能从他的身上看到。一个仆人，连鞭子都没有动用，就让弗拉希败退了，“因为他该打”。剩下的就不用说了，巴雷特小姐已经下达了判决书——弗拉希有罪！她写道：“就这样，他在我脚边的地上卧下来，撩起一点眉毛，用眼睛怯生生地望着我。”可是就算弗拉希或许正在望着她，巴雷特小姐却根本懒得去看他的眼睛。她依然躺在那张沙发上，可弗拉希却躺在了地下。

他躺在地毯上，没有人关注他。他就好像在翻腾、旋转的感情旋涡里挣扎着。或许他可以拽住一根野草，强忍痛苦慢慢爬到岸边，最后来到一片废墟的峰顶，映入眼帘的是重新开创的另一片大地上的世界，也或许他的灵魂会被卷上岩石，撞得粉身碎骨。是毁灭，还是重建？这是一个问题。毕竟在他脑海里的辩论是没有声音的，因此他所面对的困境我们只能用这些粗浅的词句来进行描述。两次，弗拉希都尽了自己最大的努力，想要杀死他的敌人，可是两次都失败了。他反省，为什么会失败呢？原因仅仅是他爱巴雷特小姐。他从眉毛下偷偷地看了看正在沙发上躺着的巴雷特小姐，巴雷特小姐一句话也不说，一副严厉的表情。他知道，这是无法更改的，终其一生，他都会爱着她。事情并不是这么简单的，相反，它特别复杂。假如他咬伤了勃朗宁先生，也就等于咬了巴雷特小姐。仇恨并不只是仇恨本身，仇恨也是爱，仅此而已。痛苦的弗拉希困惑地摇了摇耳朵，忐忑不安地在地板上翻了个身。勃朗宁先生就是巴雷特小姐，巴雷特小姐就是勃朗宁先生。恨就是爱，爱就是恨。他呻吟了一声，伸展四肢，抬起头来，钟声敲了八下。他已经进退维谷地躺在那里三个多小时了。

虽然巴雷特小姐对他冷淡，严厉，不讲情面，不过她还是放下了笔。她正在给勃朗宁先生写信：“可恶的弗拉希！……要是有像弗拉希一样的人，做出了跟狗一样粗暴的事情，他们就一定要为自己这种狗一样的行为承担后果。再看看你，你是这么和善，对他这么好。也只有你才会这样，要是换作别人，至少会说些‘火气腾腾的话’。”买个嘴套倒是个好主意，她想。她抬起头，看了看弗拉希。她忽然停顿了一下，放下手中的笔，她一定是被他眼睛里的那种莫可名状的东西给触动了。他为她牺牲了阳光，他为她吃过鸡肉和涂满了奶油的米布丁。有一次她在睡梦中被他吻醒，还把他当成了潘神。她召唤他来到自己跟前，说，她原谅他了！

可是，只是出于一时的心血来潮，就说了声原谅，而允许他回到沙发上，就好像他在地板上经历了那些痛苦的思索后却毫无所获一样，她根本就没有发现事实上他已经发生了巨变——这弗拉希可不会答应的。可是，因为当时弗拉希太疲惫了，所以他顺从了。然而，几天后，一件只有巴雷特小姐注意到的引人注目的事发生了，这件事展现出实际上他的感情是那么的深刻。那天勃朗宁先生从这里离开后，房间里只剩下巴雷特小姐跟弗拉希，如果是以前的话，他一定早就跳上沙发在她的脚边躺下了，可是这一次，他跟以往大相径庭，并没有跳上沙发去讨巴雷特小姐的爱抚，而是走到了“勃朗宁先生的扶手椅”——它已被这样称呼——跟前。弗拉希一向都很厌恶这把椅子，因为敌人的影子还留在上面。可是这一次，他的思想斗争取得了胜利，他的心里只有满满的爱。他不光盯着那把椅子打量，而且在打量它的时候“突然陷入了一种神摇魂荡的境界”。巴雷特小姐从头到尾都密切关注着他，她自然留意到了这件奇怪的事情。她顺着他的眼光看去，发现他正注视着一张桌子。那张桌子上放着勃朗宁先生带来的那盒蛋糕。他“令我意识到，你留下的蛋糕还在桌子上放着呢”。蛋糕已经干了，不再新鲜了，诱人食欲的香味已经消失了。弗拉希的意思再明白不过了，蛋糕是他的敌人送来的，所以当蛋糕还是新鲜的时候，他拒绝吃它。而现在虽然蛋糕不再新鲜了，但它的象征意义已经由恨转变为爱了，送它来的敌人也变成了朋友了，所以他要吃它。是的，他做出了表示，他要吃那盒蛋糕了。巴雷特小姐站起身来，拿起那盒蛋糕。她在把蛋糕递给他的时候，又出声告诫他：“我就向他言明，蛋糕是你带给他的，他应该为自己过去的恶劣行径感到惭愧，并下定决心爱你，以后再也不能咬你——我就这样允许他从你对他的仁爱中获得教训。”蛋糕已经被苍蝇踩过了，发霉了，散发出酸味了。当弗拉希吃下一角色香味都已变质的蛋糕时，等于是他用自己的语言庄重地宣读了之前她所说的那些话——他发誓，以后会爱勃朗宁先生，再也不会咬他了。

他立即就受到了褒奖——不是旧蛋糕或鸡翅，不是现在已经拥有了的爱抚，也不是巴雷特小姐允许他重新躺回沙发上，躺在她的脚边的承诺，他获得的褒奖是精神上的，而这种褒奖却产生了具体的、实在的、令人吃惊的效果。这几个月以来，他把所有的仇恨都集聚在心里，效果就好比一根正在生锈腐烂的铁条，把下面压着的一切生命都杀死了。而现在这根铁条被一把利刃和一场痛苦的手术取走了。血液重新流动起来，神经感受到了痒痛，新肉开始生长。就像春天到来了一样，弗拉希又能感受到树叶的生长，听到鸟儿的鸣啭了，整个大自然都在欢呼雀跃。他躺在沙发上，贴在巴雷特小姐的脚边，全身都流淌着自豪和喜悦。他再不是站在他们的对立面了，而是跟他们站在同一阵营。从现在起，他们的希望、期待和心愿，就是他的希望、期待和心愿。弗拉希的吠叫，已经变成了对勃朗宁先生的欢迎。“我希望一整个星期全都是星期二！每个月，每年，一生的每一天，全都是星期二！”勃朗宁先生抬高嗓音说道。弗拉希颈上的毛因为这些谈话时出现的简洁明快的高音调词汇竖了起来。我，弗拉希回应道，希望每个月，每年，一生的每一天全都是星期二！你们的需求就是我的需求。我们三个人正在共同筹划着一项最伟大的事情。我们因为同情而风雨同舟，我们因为仇恨而同甘共苦，我们因为爱而一脉相连。我们要团结一致，对那个骑在我们头顶的黑暴君还以颜色。总而言之，这种他似懂非懂却必然会到来的成功，这种他们共同分享的光荣胜利，令弗拉希寄托了他的全部希望。可是，意外也就在这时候突然发生了。九月一日，星期二的上午，弗拉希陪着巴雷特小姐和她的妹妹到维尔大街的一家商店买东西，就在这安全、文明、友善的中心地，突然间他就头下脚上地跌进了一片黑暗中。地牢的门在他的头顶上关上了。他被人偷了！





第四章　白教堂


“今天上午我和阿莱贝拉，弗拉希同我们一起，”巴雷特小姐写道，“坐着马车到维尔大街去办事，弗拉希像往常一样跟着我们进了商店，又出了商店，直到我上车的时候，我还看见他就跟在我后面。在车里转过身，我唤了一声‘弗拉希’，阿莱贝拉也四下扫视，寻找弗拉希——却发现弗拉希不见了！就在那短短的一瞬间，他就被人偷走了，他是从车轮下面被偷走的，你明白我在说什么吗？”勃朗宁先生非常明白，巴雷特小姐没有用铁链拴住弗拉希，有人就趁机把弗拉希给偷走了。1846年的温珀尔大街以及附近的那些街道上，这种事情屡见不鲜。

说实话，温珀尔大街要是单从表面上看的话，那是再安定不过了。她作为一个病人，能够到达的范围，或是坐轮椅所能去到的地方，所见到的只会是这样一片让人心情愉悦的景状：四层楼高的房屋，红木大门，厚厚的玻璃窗。哪怕是在下午的时候乘坐一辆双驾马车出去散步，只要车夫多小心一点，也绝不需要超出这个斯文体面的人们所居住的范围。不过话说回来，假如你不是个病人，也不乘坐两匹马拉的马车，跟大多数身体健康的人一样，喜欢用双腿走路的话，那么你在温珀尔大街周围所看到的景象、所听到的言语、所闻到的味道，都会令你对这条大街的安定产生疑问。正如托马斯·彼慕斯[14]先生在大约同一时期一时兴起来到伦敦街头散步时所发现的一样。他实实在在地被惊到了，感到无比意外。辉煌宏伟的建筑物屹立在温珀尔大街的两旁，在那些建筑物的背后，隐藏着挤满了人群和牲口的破破烂烂的棚子，上面住人，下面养牛——“七平方英尺的面积就住着两个人”。他认为应该把自己看到的、听到的这些情景让更多人了解到。可是，两三个家庭挤在一间牛棚里，棚顶没有任何通风设备，脚下正在进行着挤牛奶、杀牛、吃牛肉的事情——怎样的言语才能将这样的情景描述得贴切恰当呢？试图描述这些情景的彼慕斯先生发现，让英语来承担这项重任实在是太勉强了。但是他觉得，自己还是应该把那天下午在伦敦的那些最豪华的街区散步时的见识听闻记录下来。斑疹伤寒[15]的威胁实在太严重了，富豪们压根不知道他们所要面临的是什么样的危险。他无法对在威斯敏斯特、马里尔伯恩[16]、以及巴丁顿[17]的所见所闻保持沉默。例如，他走到一个曾经属于一位声名赫赫的贵族的旧府邸里，那里大理石壁炉架的遗迹尚在、房间里镶嵌着护板、楼梯扶手上雕着花，可是房间的地板已经朽烂，墙壁上滴滴答答地滴落着污水，在原本举办宴会的大厅里，一群群男男女女就那样半裸着身子住在那里。他又往前走了一段路，在原来贵族府邸的地皮上建起了一所“经济公寓[18]”，它是由一位胆大妄为的建筑商一再偷工减料潦潦草草建起来的，屋顶漏雨，墙壁透风。他看见一个小孩正将一个罐头浸在一条绿幽幽的小溪里，他问他们是否要饮用这水。当然，洗东西也是在这里洗，因为房子的主人只答应每个星期放两次水。要是在伦敦那些堪称最文明、最安宁的地段看见这种情景，你一定会更加惊诧不已吧？可是“连最豪华的街区都不例外”。就比如巴雷特小姐卧室后面的那个区域，就是伦敦最惨不忍睹的贫民窟之一。整洁和污浊混淆在一起。不过也有一些指定区域，专供穷人们居住，没有人会去那里打搅他们。在白教堂，或者说在托登汉宫路尽头的一个三角形的地域，在这里，贫穷、苦难和罪恶肆意繁衍、传播了好几个世纪。破旧的建筑密密匝匝地成堆挤在圣吉尔街上，“简直就是一座乞丐城，一个劳教场。”像这样的，完全由贫穷的人们堆积起来的地区，有一个恰当的称呼——“鲁克利”[19]。因为在那里，密密麻麻的人群像叠罗汉一样堆挤到一块儿，就像栖息在树梢的白嘴鸦一样多，只不过这些建筑不是树罢了，但也几乎不能称之为房子了。它们由流着污水的小巷子隔开。白天的时候，人们会半裸着身子挤满整个小巷，你听那声音吧，还有什么比那更喧嚣的？晚上的时候，那些在伦敦西区干了一天玩儿命工作的乞丐、妓女和盗贼们就会蜂拥而回。警察拿他们一点儿办法也没有。要是行人单独从这里走过，必须脚步飞快。或许，就跟彼慕斯先生一样，说一些富含种种隐喻、借代，和暗喻的话，以此来暗示，这个世界上的东西，并不是每一样都能如它应该的那样美好。霍乱已经要爆发了，或许关于霍乱的警告不必再如此遮遮掩掩。不过1846年的夏天，霍乱警告还没有被发出。在温珀尔大街及其附近居住的人们，只得到了这样的安全警告：一定要留在体面的街区里，不要走出去；一定要给狗拴上铁链。要是你忘了做这件事，就像巴雷特小姐那样，那你将付出的代价也会像巴雷特小姐现在所需付出的代价一样。毗邻的温珀尔大街和圣吉尔街的关系是早已定好的：对于圣吉尔街，只要能偷的就会偷；对于温珀尔大街，该付出什么代价就必定付出什么代价。阿莱贝拉马上“安慰我说，我顶多只需要花费十英镑，就能把他救回来”。十英镑，是根据估算，泰勒先生救一条科克尔西班尼尔狗将会索要的赎金。泰勒先生是那个黑帮的头头。温珀尔大街上不论是哪一位女士丢了自己的狗，第一时间她就应该去见泰勒先生。无论他索要的赎金是多少，她都必须照付不误，不然的话，过几天就会有一个装着狗脑袋和狗爪的牛皮纸包寄到温珀尔大街。这是一位曾经和泰勒先生砍价的女士所受到的教训，就发生在温珀尔大街上。对于巴雷特小姐来说，她肯定是打算付钱的。所以她一回到家里就立马跟她的弟弟亨利说了这事，当天下午，亨利就去见了泰勒先生。他去时，泰勒先生“正在抽雪茄，房间里挂满了图画”——据传闻说，泰勒先生光是每年从温珀尔大街的狗身上获得的钱就有两三千英镑——泰勒先生承诺，第二天就会把狗弄回来，不过这之前他先要跟他的“组织”协商一下。这件事太让人恼火了，但更让人恼火的是，巴雷特小姐这时候正需要用钱。1846年要是忘了给狗拴上铁链，那么一定就是这个结果了。

不过于弗拉希而言，情况就完全不是这个样子了。弗拉希，巴雷特小姐认为，“并不知道我们能够把他救回来”，因为弗拉希对人类社会的那一套规则完全陌生，“他一定会整夜哀嚎，我完全明白”。九月一日星期二的下午，巴雷特小姐在给勃朗宁先生的信中这样写道。可就在巴雷特小姐给勃朗宁先生写信的时候，弗拉希正在经历他一生中最可怕的煎熬。他正处于极度困惑之中。上一秒他还走在威尔大街上五颜六色的丝带中间，可是下一秒他就头下脚上地被套进了一个袋子中，一路颠簸地穿过了好几条街，最终被人从袋子里弄了出来，丢在了这里。他发现自己处在彻底的黑暗之中，置身于一个阴冷潮湿的地方。当他不再那么眩晕，微微恢复一些清醒后，在这间又黑又矮的屋子里辨认出了一些东西——破破烂烂的几张椅子和一张床垫。没多久，他被人抓了起来，被拴在了某个东西的腿上。有一个四脚朝天的东西在地上躺着——不知道是人，还是什么动物。脏兮兮的裙子拖在地上，还有大皮靴子，绊手绊脚、一个劲地在这里进进出出。地上满是腐臭的肉渣，苍蝇围在这里，嗡嗡地叫着。从阴暗的角落里爬出几个孩童，过来揪他的耳朵。他因为嚎叫了几声，脑袋就被一只分量十足的手狠狠打了一下。他紧贴着墙根儿，蜷缩在那只有几英寸的潮乎乎的砖地上。这会儿他终于能够看清楚了，地上挤满了形形色色的动物。几只瘦了吧唧、肋骨都清晰可见的狗正在为一块腐臭了的肉骨头争得你死我活。他们是那么肮脏，没有人给他们梳理皮毛，也没有人给他们擦洗身子，他们个个带着疾病，个个饿得发疯。可是弗拉希看出来了，他们都曾是很名贵的狗，戴着铁链，并有专门的仆人伺候，就像他一样。

他躺在那里，一连好几个小时都不敢出声，令他感到最难受的就是口渴。离他不远的地方放着一只桶，桶里面装着污浊的绿幽幽的水，他喝了一小口，然后被恶心坏了，他宁愿被渴死也不会再喝第二口。可是有一只好看的灰毛猎狗却不顾一切，在那里一通狂饮。每当门被踹开的时候，他就会抬头向那里张望，巴雷特小姐——是巴雷特小姐吗？巴雷特小姐终于来了吗？但进来的只是一个满脸胡子的恶棍。那个混蛋用脚踢他们，好给他分开一条路，然后一脚深一脚浅地走到一把破破烂烂的椅子前，狠狠地坐下去。这里越来越黑了，他几乎分辨不出那些在地上的、在床垫上的、在破椅子上的影子是些什么了。壁炉上面的架子上，点了一小段蜡烛，火光映照到外面的街沟里。弗拉希凭借这点摇摇晃晃、昏昏沉沉的火光，看见一些吓人的脸孔从外面经过，在窗户旁往里瞅了瞅，然后走了进来。这个小小的屋子本来就快挤爆了，这下就更挤了，弗拉希只能再次往后退一点，把身子蜷缩得更紧，贴在墙根上。这些恐怖的怪物——有的衣衫褴褛，有的被胭脂和羽毛所包裹——蹲坐在地上，围着桌子蜷缩着。他们开始喝酒。喝酒的时候，他们一边骂骂咧咧，一边打打闹闹。更多的狗从那些被扔在地上的口袋里钻出来，有哈巴狗，塞特猎狗，还有戴着项圈儿的指示犬。一只白色的大鹦鹉一边扑楞着翅膀惊慌地在各个角落横冲直撞，一边叫嚷着：“漂亮的鹦鹉！漂亮的鹦鹉！”要是它的女主人，那位住在麦达古的寡妇听到这个声音，一定会被吓得魂不附体的。接着那些女人们也打开了自己的口袋，从里面抖落出一些耳环、手镯、胸针，与弗拉希在巴雷特小姐和亨利艾塔小姐那儿见到的那些首饰一样。这些东西引发了怪物们的争抢，他们开始叫嚷、咒骂，狗也吠叫起来，孩子们也开始尖叫，至于那只漂亮的白毛大鹦鹉更是吵个不休：“漂亮的鹦鹉！漂亮的鹦鹉！”而且越叫越急促。对于这种常常被挂在温珀尔大街的窗户上的鸟，弗拉希早就司空见惯了。冷不丁地，一只拖鞋飞了起来，砸在它的身上，吓得那家伙发了疯一样，猛拍那双带着些黄斑的灰翅膀。蜡烛不知被它扇到哪去了，黑暗顿时把这间屋子给吞没了。闷热越来越严重，再加上臭烘烘的气味，简直叫人无法忍受。弗拉希的鼻子热腾腾的，他浑身抽搐着。可巴雷特小姐还没有来。

巴雷特小姐正躺在温珀尔大街卧室的沙发上。她十分懊恼，忧心忡忡，但并没有因此而惊慌失措。弗拉希肯定会遭罪的，他一定会彻夜哀嚎。不过再有几个小时就会好了，只要泰勒先生提出他的条件，她如数付完赎金，弗拉希就能回来了。

九月二日，星期三，白教堂的“鲁克利”迎来了新的黎明。灰色的晨曦破窗而入，阳光照射到那些仰躺在地上的恶徒那毛绒绒的脸上。弗拉希从迷迷糊糊中苏醒，再一次面对现实。这就是现实——这间屋子，这些恶徒，这些被拴得紧紧的、互相撕咬着的、不断哀嚎的狗，以及这片阴暗和潮湿。他昨天真的有跟着女士们行走在商店里那五颜六色的丝带中吗？世界上真的有那个叫作温珀尔大街的地方吗？真的有那样一个屋子，干净凉爽的饮水正在紫色的罐头里泛起涟漪吗？那么柔软舒适的垫子，他真的躺过吗？那香喷喷的烤鸡翅，他真的吃过吗？还有那个戴着黄手套的男人，他真的因为嫉妒和怒火而咬过他吗？那种生活，那些情感全都流逝了，渐渐消融，最终变得虚幻起来。

阳光冲破尘埃的封锁，照进屋子里，一个女人喘着粗气从麻袋上站起来，跌跌撞撞地走出去取啤酒。又开始喝酒了，咒骂声也随之而起。有一个膀大腰圆的女人攥住弗拉希的耳朵，把他从地上拎起来，她捏了捏他的肋骨，把他当作笑料，开着恶心人的玩笑——当她将他丢回地上的时候，那些恶棍们哄然大笑。那扇门，时不时被人踹开，又咣当一声关上。每一次，他都会抬起头来向着门口张望。会是威尔逊吗？要么是勃朗宁先生？或是巴雷特小姐？但都不是——那只是一个刽子手，一个小偷。看见那拖曳在地上的脏裙子和硬邦邦的靴子，他立马把头缩了回去。一次，有根骨头被丢在他的面前，他试着咬了一口，上面的肉像石头一样坚硬，他的牙齿根本咬不动，那股刺鼻的恶臭味实在让他觉得恶心。他越来越口渴了，他迫不得已舔了舔从桶里溢出来的绿色脏水。这个星期三为何过得如此缓慢。他躺在破木板上，闷热感，干渴感，疼痛感，都在加剧，三者汇在一起使他感到越来越煎熬。他对一切都漠不关心了，只是在门开时他还会抬头望一望。不，那不是巴雷特小姐。

事情进行得并不是很顺利，躺在温珀尔大街卧室沙发上的巴雷特小姐越发焦急起来。泰勒承诺过星期三下午会到白教堂跟他的“组织”沟通一下，可是别说星期三的下午了，甚至连晚上都已经过去了，泰勒却还没现身。照她的理解，这就意味着赎金要提高了——可是现在她的手头真的并不宽裕。不过，这笔钱，她还是要付的。她在给勃朗宁先生写信时说：“你知道的，我不能没有弗拉希。我不能冒险，不能去找他们商量赎金，不能去跟他们争吵。”所以她躺在沙发上给勃朗宁先生写信的时候，时刻倾听、等待着敲门声。威尔逊进来送信；威尔逊进来送热水。都到就寝的时间了，可是弗拉希还是没有回来。

九月三日，星期四，白教堂又迎来了新的黎明。那扇门打开又关上，在弗拉希身边躺着的那条哀嚎了一整夜的红色塞特猎犬被牵走了，拉走他的是一个穿着鼹鼠皮背心的恶棍。那条狗将会有什么样的命运呢？继续留在这里，或者死亡，哪个更好一些呢？活着和死去哪个更糟一些呢？这里的饥饿、口渴、噪音、恶臭——弗拉希记得，以前他对科隆香水特别厌恶——正在飞快地抹除他记忆里清晰的东西和欲望。他的脑海里，那些记忆的碎片开始翻涌不休。那是从田野里传来的老米特福德医生的呼喝声吗？门口那正在闲聊的，是科伦哈泼克跟面包师吗？屋子里面那窸窸窣窣的是什么声音？他觉得那是米特福德小姐正在捆一束天竺葵。原来那只是风——今天的风格外的猛烈——打在破烂窗格的牛皮纸上发出的声音。贫民窟里的醉鬼们歇斯底里地大呼小叫。角落里正在用平底锅炸青鱼的老太婆一个劲地嘟囔着；他已经被抛弃了，被遗忘了。没有人对他说话，或者救他出去。“漂亮的鹦鹉！漂亮的鹦鹉！”只有那只大鹦鹉还在不知疲倦地吼叫着。另外，还有一只金丝雀叽叽喳喳的，不知在胡乱叫什么。

屋子又被黑暗吞没了，又到了夜晚。碟子里那根竖着的蜡烛被点着了，外面又摇晃起了那昏昏沉沉的火光。接二连三的，从门口吧嗒着脚板走进来许多人，他们背着包裹，男人们个个面色凶狠，女人们个个涂脂抹粉，打扮得十分妖艳。他们有的躺倒在破床上，有的躺在桌子上。白教堂又一次被夜幕包裹起来。屋顶上有一个洞，雨水从洞里滴滴答答很有节奏地漏下来，滴进放在下面的一个用来接雨水的桶里。巴雷特小姐依然没有出现。

星期四早晨，温珀尔大街。弗拉希杳无踪影——泰勒那里没有传来任何消息。巴雷特小姐心里格外慌乱。她开始向人们问询。她把弟弟亨利叫来，询问他详细情况，然后发现她被他骗了。泰勒那个“邪恶的魔鬼”那天晚上按照约定来过，并且说了他的要价：六个几尼给他的“组织”，半个几尼给他本人。只是亨利只把这事告诉了巴雷特先生，却对她隐瞒了。很显然，巴雷特先生叮嘱他不许告诉他姐姐泰勒来过，也不许他去付这笔赎金。巴雷特小姐“气急败坏”，她命令她弟弟马上再去一次泰勒先生那里，并把赎金给他。亨利拒绝了，并“提起了爸爸”。拿爸爸来阻止这件事是不可能的，她反驳说，就在他们谈话的时候，弗拉希就有可能会被杀死。要是亨利不愿意去，她就自己去，这件事她是铁了心的。她给勃朗宁先生的信中说：“……要是他们不按我的决定去做，不把弗拉希救回来，明天早晨我就自己去。”

但很快巴雷特小姐就意识到了，这件事办起来比想象的要难得多。无论是她出去找弗拉希，还是弗拉希自己找回来，都是困难重重的。弗拉希被偷走，泰勒索要赎金，所有的消息都不胫而走，就好像整个温珀尔大街都在跟她对着干。温珀尔大街决定要跟白教堂大战一场。那位双目失明的博伊特先生派人过来传话，说他觉得要是付了这笔赎金，就是“助纣为虐”。连他的父亲和弟弟也竭力反对，为了维护他们的阶级利益，他们可以采取任何手段。但是最糟糕的还不是这些，——比这更糟糕的事情——勃朗宁先生居然也站在了温珀尔大街这一边。他用自己的学识、逻辑和口才，使出浑身解术来跟弗拉希作对。他写道，要是她向泰勒低头了，那么就等于是向罪恶低头了，向敲诈勒索者臣服了。这样做的话，无疑是助长邪恶和黑暗阵营的气焰，令正义与无辜受辱。要是她把这笔赎金交付给泰勒，“……那没有那么多钱来赎回爱犬的穷人又该怎么办呢？”他充分发挥自己的想象力，想象假如泰勒勒索的对象是他，哪怕他索要的只是五先令，他也会跟他说：“针对你手底下的人的这种行为，你必须为其承担后果，我找的就是你……什么砍脑袋砍脚爪，那些伎俩都对我没用，实话告诉你，我就是要干掉你这个强盗，哪怕付出我毕生的精力也在所不辞，我会施展一切可能的手段来收拾你和你的那些团伙，既然让我找到了你，我就绝不会放虎归山……”假如泰勒有幸见到这位绅士的话，这就是勃朗宁先生打算对他说的话。勃朗宁先生赶着星期四下午的末班邮车寄来了第二封信，信里他写道：“要是人们都只懂得软弱、忍受，当那些形形色色的吸血鬼掌握了这个秘密，你想想这种情况是多么可怕吧，他们会得寸进尺，更加得意忘形。”他并没有责怪巴雷特小姐，在他的眼里，巴雷特小姐所做的每一件事情都是完全合理、完全正确的。不过，在星期五上午的来信中，他还是这样说了：“我觉得这种软弱是一种悲哀……”要是她采取这样的方式，就等于是鼓励了泰勒的偷狗行为，这与赞成巴纳德·格雷戈里先生[20]盗窃人们的名誉是没有区别的。她有必要为那些有过悲惨遭遇的人们肩负起间接责任，像巴纳德·格雷戈里那样的恶徒记下了一本名录，诋毁他们的名誉，他们有的背井离乡，有的自杀身亡。“这些都是世界上最浅显的道理了，可是我为什么还要一遍又一遍地重复这些老掉牙的话呢？”就这样，勃朗宁先生每天都会从新路口那里写来两封信，以游说巴雷特小姐。

巴雷特小姐躺在沙发上，把这些信都一一看完了。“在我看来，您的宝贵意见比一百条科克尔西班尼尔狗的价值都高”，要说这种话是多么轻而易举啊，像“让步”这样的事情，是多么容易做到啊。她完全可以轻轻松松地靠在沙发的靠枕上，叹上一口气，愉悦地张口说一句：“你们替我决定吧，我只是一个弱不禁风的小女人，不大懂法律和公理。”她只需要拒绝支付赎金，她只需要不去理会泰勒跟他的团伙就行了。就算他们把弗拉希给杀了，把弗拉希的头跟脚爪装进包裹寄过来，她一打开包裹它们就从里面滚出来，也会有勃朗宁先生站在她的身边对她说她做得对，她赢得了他的尊敬。可是巴雷特小姐是不会被吓倒的。巴雷特小姐提笔反驳罗伯特·勃朗宁。这实在太好了，她写道，不光引用了多恩[21]的话，还举了格雷戈里的例子，甚至想出了一番慷慨激昂的回复泰勒先生的演讲词——即便泰勒先生打了她，格雷戈里诋毁她，她还是会那样做——可是如果是她被那些恶徒绑架了，她被他们牢牢地控制住了，然后威胁说，要把她的耳朵割下来，把它寄到新路口，不知勃朗宁先生会怎么做呢？不管他会做出怎样的举动，反正她的决心是不会变的。弗拉希那么孤独无助，她必须把他救回来，这是她的责任。“可是弗拉希，可怜的弗拉希，如此忠诚的弗拉希，如此深爱我的弗拉希，难道只因为该对泰勒先生兴师问罪，我就有权牺牲无辜的弗拉希吗？”她一定要把弗拉希救回来，无论勃朗宁先生说什么，就算她需要孤身一人深入白教堂那个魔窟，就算勃朗宁先生会因此看不起她。

于是，星期六这天，即便面前的桌子上放着已经拆开了的勃朗宁先生写来的信，可她还是准备把出门的衣服穿在身上。“我再补充一句，只针对这个问题而言，世上那些庸俗的父亲、兄弟、丈夫和家长们所采取的这种应该被诅咒的策略，我真的极为讨厌。”她读道。假如她去了白教堂，那么也就等于站在了罗伯特·勃朗宁的对立面，而跟那些庸俗的父亲、兄弟、家长们同流合污了。不过，她继续穿着衣服。一阵狗的哀嚎声从外面的小巷里传了进来，这条狗被那些残忍的人们捆绑得紧紧的，它一丝反抗的能力都没有。她听到这哀嚎声，就好像听见它在说：“想想弗拉希吧。”她穿好鞋子，把斗篷披在身上，把帽子戴好，又向着勃朗宁先生的那封信上扫了一眼。她读道：“我想要娶你。”那条狗还在哀嚎着。她出了卧室，走下楼去。

路上，亨利·巴雷特撞见了她，并告诉她在他看来，如果她执意如此，她极有可能会遭到抢劫，甚至被杀。她吩咐威尔逊去雇一辆马车。威尔逊吓得身子抖个不停，不过她还是照着吩咐去做了。马车到了以后，巴雷特小姐叫威尔逊上车。这是让她去送死啊，威尔逊坚信不疑，不过她还是上了马车。巴雷特小姐自己也上了马车，命令车夫起行，前往曼宁街的“滨沟”。他们出发了。红木大门，平整的玻璃窗，地下室前面的空地附近围着的铁栅栏，很快，这些东西都从他们的视野里消失了，他们来到了一个巴雷特小姐从来没有见过，也从来没有想象过的世界——牛群挤在卧室的地板之下，而人们就举家睡在这个窗户残破不堪的屋子里；这里每个星期只放两次水；贫穷和罪恶在这里不断繁殖；他们到了一个体面的车夫从未涉足过的地方。马车停了下来，车夫走进一家小酒肆去问路。“有两三个人从里面走出来，‘啊，你们找的人应该是泰勒先生，我敢打赌！’”两位女士乘坐马车跑到这神秘的世界里来，那她们要办的事情只会有一件，这里的人再清楚不过那是什么事情了。实在是惊心动魄。一个人跑到房子里，出来后说泰勒先生“‘不在家！我难道就在车上坐着吗？’害怕到极点的威尔逊一再恳求我别去干傻事。”车子被一大群男人和孩子给围住了。那个人又问：“您看，我还需要见泰勒先生的太太吗？”巴雷特小姐并不想见泰勒先生的太太，不过正在这时，从屋子里走出来一个胖得令人难以置信的女人，她“就是那种永远都睡得着吃得香的人”。她丈夫不在家，她告诉巴雷特小姐。“可能过几分钟就会回来，也可能过几小时才会回来——我愿意下车等他回来吗？”威尔逊拽了拽她的长大衣。你想想，光是在车里坐着就要忍受一大帮男人和孩子的围观，难道还要到那个女人的屋子里去等吗？于是巴雷特小姐就坐在车上跟那个“肥胖的女强盗”谈判。她的狗现在被泰勒先生所掌握，她说，泰勒先生承诺过要把她的狗还回来，今天泰勒先生能把狗送到温珀尔大街吗？“哦，当然没问题！”胖女人满脸堆笑，做出一副殷勤的样子，回答道。泰勒先生就是出去办这件事的，她比谁都清楚。她的脑袋“左摇右摆，以一种最优雅的姿势晃动着”。

于是，马车便掉头，离开了曼宁街的“滨沟”。按照威尔逊的说法就是“我们总算是侥幸死里逃生了”。巴雷特小姐自己也受到了震撼。“显而易见，在那里那群恶徒的势力相对来说是最大的。那个团伙，那个‘诡秘的组织’……他们的根在那里扎得很深。”她写道。许许多多的画面在她的眼前不断闪现，她的脑子里一个劲地思索着。这一切居然就在温珀尔大街的另一边——这些面孔，这些房子。在马车上从酒馆门前看见的那些东西，比她躺在温珀尔大街的卧室里花费五年时间所看到的东西还要多。“他们的面孔！”她惊呼道。她对那些面孔的印象太深刻了。她的想象力被它们激发了出来。看那些摆在书架上的胸像，那些“神圣的大理石雕像”却从来没有勾起过她哪怕一丝的想象。那里住着跟她一样的女人，她躺在沙发上，读书、写作，而她们却那样生活着。这会儿，在这条两旁耸立着四层楼的大街上，马车又开始奔跑了。那些熟悉的大门、窗户、黄铜门环、整洁的窗帘，还有砖砌的大道接踵出现。温珀尔大街50号到了。威尔逊从车上跳下来，可以想象，她一定会大松一口气吧——总算是平安回来了。可是巴雷特小姐却踌躇了那么一会儿，“那些人的面孔”依然在她眼前晃荡。很多年以后，当她坐在意大利新居那阳光充沛的阳台上的时候，这些脸孔又一次在她的眼前出现了。她从中获得灵感，写出了无比生动的诗篇，并编入了《奥罗拉·利》[22]。可是现在管家已经把马车门打开了，她只能又回到了楼上的卧室里。

到星期六这天，弗拉希已经被囚困了五天。他浑身一点力气也没有了，他已经完全绝望了。他仅仅只是躺在那块拥挤不堪的地板上一隅黑暗的角落里喘着气。那扇门时而被用力踹开，时而哐当一声关上。粗野的声音喊叫着，女人们大声尖叫，那声嘶力竭的声音刺耳极了。那只鹦鹉依然一个劲地聒噪着，翻来覆去只那么一句话，就像以前在麦达古跟寡妇们说话时一样，不过现在这些话所招来的除了老太婆们的咒骂没有别的。他太虚弱了，就连皮毛里有小虫子在窜来窜去他也懒得动弹一下了。那些过去的生活元素正在弗拉希的世界里一一消失——雷丁、暖房、米特福德小姐、凯尼恩先生、遮光窗帘上的农夫、胸像、书架——它们就像正在一口大锅里迅速消融的雪花一样。到了现在，如果说他心中还有什么期盼的话，那一定是一种不切实际的东西，那是一张仍然被称作“巴雷特小姐”的模糊不清的脸。世界上的一切都消失了，只有她还存在着，即便她也不可能跨过那无法跨越的天堑，来到他的身边。可是，她依然存在着。暗夜又将侵吞一切了，巴雷特小姐——他心中最后的希望，也将被黑暗粉碎了。

事实上，就算到了这最后一刻，温珀尔大街的那些方方面面的力量也还在竭力阻止弗拉希回到巴雷特小姐身边。星期六下午，遵照那个胖女人的承诺，巴雷特小姐在家里苦等泰勒先生前来。总算把他等来了，可是他却没有把她的狗带来。他只是叫人上楼通报——要巴雷特小姐当下就把六几尼付给他，他将马上去白教堂把狗带过来，“以他的名誉担保”。像泰勒这种“邪恶的魔鬼”的名誉担保，又有几分可信度呢？巴雷特小姐对此毫无信心。可是“好像也没有其他办法了”，弗拉希随时都可能有生命危险。泰勒正在走廊里等候，她叫人把六几尼钱送到楼下去。可是命运似乎故意跟巴雷特小姐唱反调，正当走廊里的泰勒一边等候一边欣赏那些雕塑、地毯、雨伞和其他奢华物品的时候，阿尔弗雷德·巴雷特走了进来。当他看见泰勒这个大恶棍居然出现在自己家里时，一下子就怒火爆发了，他大动干戈，破口大骂，骂他是“骗子、说谎的人、贼”，泰勒先生自然不会忍气吞声，就跟他对骂了起来。最糟糕的是，他信誓旦旦地说“由于他希望得到救赎，我们再也不可能见到我们的狗了”，他撂下这句话后，就气冲冲地离开了这里，一个鲜血染透的包裹会在第二天早上被送到这里。

巴雷特小姐慌乱地把衣服套上，跑到楼下去。威尔逊在哪里？赶紧叫她去雇一辆马车来。她要立刻到“滨沟”去。家里的人全都跑来阻止她。太阳就要落山了，她感觉浑身的力气都被抽干了。就算是一个身体强壮的男人，要做这件事也意味着极大的风险，而对于她来说，这跟发疯没什么两样。她的弟弟妹妹们全都跑过来，把她围在中间，劝阻她，恐吓她，“他们大呼小叫，骂我任性妄为，冥顽不灵，说我‘疯了’，他们把我狠狠骂了一顿，就像是在骂泰勒先生一样。”可是她却丝毫没有动摇自己的决心。到后来，他们总算是领教了她已经愚蠢到了什么地步：他们根本劝阻不了她，就算前面有着无法想象的危险。塞普蒂默斯向巴雷特小姐承诺，他会立马拿钱去泰勒家里把狗赎回来，只要她先回卧室去，并且“保持心情愉悦”。

九月五日的黄昏已经被浓稠的夜色代替，白教堂那间屋子的门又被踹开了，进来一个满脸络腮胡的恶棍，他抠住弗拉希的颈背，把他从角落里拎了出来。弗拉希看着这张可怕的脸，不知道这个仇敌是要放了他，还是要杀了他。不过他已经不在乎了，现在唯一还能略微记得的，就是巴雷特小姐那模模糊糊的身影。那个人弯下腰来，用他那粗棱棱的手指在他的喉咙上摸捏着。那是一条铁链，还是一把刀子？弗拉希的腿在颤抖，他感到眼前发黑，趔趔趄趄地被拖拽到了外面。

正待在温珀尔大街的巴雷特小姐，现在心急火燎地连饭都吃不下去了。她不知道弗拉希是否还活着。八点钟的时候，有人敲开门，送来了勃朗宁先生的信件。他每天都会写信来。但当她开门接信的时候，一个东西溜了进来——弗拉希！他径直奔向他的紫色水罐，一连往水罐里加了三次水，可他还在喝个不停。巴雷特小姐看着他，看着这条脏兮兮、晃悠悠、迷迷瞪瞪的狗不停地喝水，她这样说道：“跟我期盼的不太一样，他好像并不是那么想见我。”是的，他现在最想要的只有一样——干净的饮水。

那些人的脸，巴雷特小姐只是看过一眼，可是只这一眼，她的脑海里就永远印刻下了那些面孔。他们把弗拉希控制在那里，整整折磨了他五天。而现在，他又能躺回那张垫子上了。可是，这世界上唯一实在，唯一有价值的东西，就只剩下清水了。至于屋子里其他的、原本看起来很神圣的东西，无论是衣橱、书架，还是胸像，一切都变成虚假的玩意儿了。而这间屋子，也只是一个避难所了，不再是他的整个世界。它只是他的一个小巢穴，用弱不禁风的草叶遮掩起来，藏匿在一片随时可能遭遇猛兽和毒蛇的森林里，在这片森林的每一棵大树后面，都隐藏着一个杀人恶魔，他们随时都准备扑出来行凶。他神志恍惚，软塌塌地躺在沙发上巴雷特小姐的脚边，那些被拴起来的狗的惨嚎声，那些鸟的惊怖尖叫，都还在他的耳畔回荡不绝。每次门一开，他都会被吓得一惊，以为是一个满脸络腮胡的家伙拿着刀冲进来了——但是进来的人，要么是戴着黄手套的勃朗宁先生，要么是夹着一本书的凯尼恩先生，他现在开始躲避勃朗宁先生和凯尼恩先生了，他不再信任他们了。他们的抚摸全都隐藏着奸诈，在他们的友善和笑容背后，充满着残忍、谎言和背叛。就连威尔逊带他到邮筒寄信，他也感到心惊胆战。必须戴上铁链他才肯迈步。当他们问他“可怜的弗拉希，你被那些恶棍抓走过吗”时，他就会仰起头，呜呜地哀鸣，咆哮。只要听到一声鞭子响，他就会急匆匆地蹿下楼梯，把自己藏到一个安全的地方。要是待在屋子里，他就会留在沙发上，紧紧地挨着巴雷特小姐，只有她没有背弃他，只有她还能让他保持一些信任。慢慢地，巴雷特小姐又变回原先的巴雷特小姐了。脏兮兮的、瘦弱的弗拉希躺在沙发上，紧贴在她的脚边，筋疲力尽地发着抖。

白教堂的记忆随着日子一天天过去总算是得以平缓了。弗拉希躺在沙发上，紧紧挨着巴雷特小姐。他比以前更能读懂她的感情变化了。他曾一度失去她，现在总算又回到了她的身边。他们的关系比以往任何时刻都要紧密。无论是她的一个动作，还是她一瞬间的惊诧，他都会做出与她同步的反应。这些天她似乎总是一惊一乍的，她甚至会因为邮递员送来一个包裹而惊得跳起来。她把包裹拆开，然后双手颤抖着，从里面取出一双厚皮靴。旋即，她就将皮靴藏到了衣橱的隐蔽处，再躺回到沙发上，装作什么事也没有发生过一样。只是，有些事情真实地发生了。当屋子里只有他们俩的时候，她下了沙发，把一串钻石项链以及装着勃朗宁先生信件的盒子从一个抽屉里取出来。项链、靴子和信件全都被她藏进了一个旅行箱里——她好像听到楼梯上有脚步声——她飞快地把箱子推到床底下，并且回到沙发上躺好，再次把披巾盖上。她这些神神秘秘的举动，肯定是某种即将发生的危机的预兆，弗拉希这么认为。难道他们要远走高飞吗？他们马上要从这个可怕的到处都是偷狗贼、恶霸和暴君的地方逃走了吗？哇！很可能是这样的！他呜呜地叫了起来，激动得全身颤抖。巴雷特小姐压低嗓音，叫他不要出声，他立即安静了下来。她自己也静悄悄的。无论是哪一个弟弟或妹妹进来，她都会立刻躺回沙发上，一直保持着那个姿势。她躺着跟巴雷特先生说话，一如往常。

但到了九月二十日，星期六，巴雷特小姐做了一件事情，就弗拉希所知，她以前从来没有做过这样的事情。她刚刚穿好衣服，就马上出门，并做出一副已经吃过早饭的样子。就在她穿衣服的那会儿，弗拉希就透过她的神情看出，这一次她并不打算带他一起去。她准备单枪匹马去办一件很隐秘的事情。到了十点钟，威尔逊也穿好了衣服，来到屋子里，准备要出门散步的样子。她们俩一起出去了，弗拉希自己躺在沙发上，等待她们回来。巴雷特小姐大概在一个小时后一个人回来了。她就好像根本没有看到他一样，一眼也没往他身上瞅。她把手套摘掉后，他看见了，在她左手的一根手指上有一个亮闪闪的东西，那是一枚金戒指。过了片刻，她把戒指从手指上摘下来，藏到了一个抽屉黑漆漆的旮旯里。做完这些后，她又像平常那样，躺回了沙发上。无论发生了什么事情，他们都要想尽一切办法来保守秘密，因此他躺在她身边的时候，连大气都不敢出一口。

无论用什么办法，一定要让屋子跟原来的生活情形保持一模一样。可是，任何一件东西都发生变化了。对于弗拉希来说，就连拉开或者关上百叶窗，都像是一个预兆。阴影或者光线投射到那些胸像上，也都像是一种隐喻或者召唤。屋子里的所有事物都好像注意到了有什么变化即将发生，并做好了迎接大事件的准备。不过，所有的一切又都是隐蔽的，静悄悄的。和往常一样，弟弟妹妹们时不时来探望她，巴雷特先生每晚都会来，检查下她有没有喝葡萄酒，有没有把排骨吃完。谁都看不出在她身上隐藏着什么秘密，她不会让自己露出一丁点儿破绽来。如果屋里有别人的话，她一定会跟他们说说笑笑。不过如果屋子里只剩下他们俩的时候，她就会从床底下把那只箱子给拽出来，一边倾听外面的动静，一边偷偷摸摸、手疾眼快地把什么东西装进箱子里。这时候她的样子显然是非常紧张的。星期天，当听到教堂的钟声时，有人问：“那是哪里的钟声？”亨利艾塔小姐回答说：“是马里尔伯恩教堂的钟声。”这时候，弗拉希注意到，巴雷特小姐的脸刷一下就白了。但没有人注意到这一点。

周一，周二，周三，周四，时间一天天过去。吃饭，说话，沉默，在沙发上躺着，这样的生活就像一张蒙在他们头顶的毯子一样。弗拉希总是睡不踏实，他梦见了森林，在大森林里，他们身上盖着蕨类植物和树叶，并肩躺在那里。树叶忽然飞走了，他醒了过来。乌漆墨黑的屋子里，他看见威尔逊鬼鬼祟祟地走进来，把那只箱子从床底下抽出来，提着它轻手轻脚地走到外面。这是发生在九月十八日，星期五的夜里的事。星期六那天，他在沙发上躺了一整个上午，他就像一个预料到随时可能落下来一条手帕，随时会有一声口哨吹响，随时会有一个生死攸关的信号发出的人一样。他的眼睛一眨也不眨，看着巴雷特小姐把衣服穿好。三点四十五的时候，威尔逊打开门走了进来。这时候，信号发出了——巴雷特小姐伸出双手把他抱了起来，直起腰后就朝着门口走去。他们稍微驻足了片刻，回头扫视着这间屋子。那是胸像，那是桌子，那是沙发，沙发边上是勃朗宁先生的扶手椅。从常春藤叶子的缝隙里，透射进一缕缕阳光，微风轻轻扰动遮光窗帘，上面那行走的农夫舒舒卷卷。所有的一切都跟往常一样，似乎无论到什么时候，它们都将保持这样。可是，这将是巴雷特小姐和弗拉希在这屋里停留的最后片刻。巴雷特小姐轻轻地关上了那扇门。

他们不动声色地从楼梯上下来，走过客厅，走过书房，走过餐厅。入目的一切都还是它们平常的那个样子，闻到的一切，也都还是原本的那些气味。所有的一切安静得仿佛在这九月炎热的下午睡着了一样。大厅里躺在席子上的猎狗卡蒂琳也沉浸在梦乡里。他们走到前门，偷偷地拧动了门把手。在门外面，有一辆马车正在等候。

巴雷特小姐轻声细语地说道：“去霍奇森家。”弗拉希在她的双膝上安安静静地坐着。世界上的任何东西都不足以让他去打破这诡谲的宁静。





第五章　意大利


时间在流逝，一小时又一小时，一天又一天，一周又一周。在这期间，弗拉希感到忽明忽暗，四周一直有一个哐当哐当的声音在响。从隧道里穿过时，每一个角落都陷入昏暗，他被晃来晃去，不得安宁。接着，他又被提到了光亮中，他看到了近旁巴雷特小姐的脸。在他的视线里，还有那些斑驳的阳光、疏朗的树木、向前延伸的铁轨和高高大大的房屋。弗拉希所受到的这些待遇，全都是因为那时候铁路旅行的粗暴规定——狗必须关在笼子里。不过弗拉希没有一丝害怕。他们正在逃离，他们正将所有的恶棍和偷狗的强盗都甩在身后。随便你是哐当哐当地响，还是嘎吱嘎吱地挤，只要让我们远离那个白教堂和温珀尔大街就好，他在随着火车忽左忽右地颠簸时这样嘀咕道。终于车厢里一片明亮，哐当声终于停了。他听到了天空中鸟儿们的啁啾鸣啭，听见了沐浴在微风中的树木发出的叹息。那哗啦啦的声音是水流的声音吗？他张开眼睛，抖了抖身子。眼前的一幕，是那么的叫人惊讶，巴雷特小姐正坐在水流中央的一块大石头上。树枝在她头顶探头探脑，河水在她周围奔流不息。她一定处于危险当中！弗拉希纵身跳进湍急的河水中，溅起一路浪花跑到她的身边。当他踏上那块大石，跑到巴雷特小姐身边时，巴雷特小姐说道：“……他以比德拉卡[23]的名义接受了洗礼。”这时候，他们已经到了沃克鲁斯，她正坐在比德拉卡喷泉中间的一块石头上。

接下来又开始哐当哐当地响，嘎吱嘎吱地挤。不过，没多久，他就站在了稳定的地板上。黑暗退散，阳光打在他身上。他发现自己还活着，清醒着，只是不知怎么回事，自己就站在一间阳光充沛的大屋子的红瓷砖地面上了。他开始在屋子里来回跑动，这儿嗅嗅，那儿嗅嗅，用爪子碰碰这个，碰碰那个。这里没有地毯，没有壁炉，没有沙发，也没有扶手椅，没有书架，没有胸像——一样都没有。从未闻到过的辛辣气味刺激着他的鼻子，使他猛打喷嚏。锐利清晰的阳光晃得他睁不开眼睛。他从未踏进过这样一间——如果这确实是一间屋子的话——如此坚硬，如此明亮，如此宽广，如此空旷的屋子。在屋子中央放着一张桌子，巴雷特小姐就坐在桌旁的一张椅子上，这样一来，她好像比以前更显得瘦小了。威尔逊带着他出了门，时而满眼阳光，时而满眼阴影，让他无法适应，他感觉自己几近失明。大街上一边热得不行，而另一边却冷得要命。女人们都穿着厚厚的皮大衣在街上行走，手里还举着遮阳伞护着自己的脑袋。街道上干燥异常。虽然现在已是十一月中旬，可是大街上连一点儿能把他的爪子弄湿或把鸟羽粘成团的稀泥或水洼都没有。这里没有用栏杆来划分地段，当然，也不会有地段的划分。这里也没有在温珀尔大街或牛津街上所能闻到的令人倍感舒爽的混杂气味。不过，却有一些陌生的气味从那些石头角落里和干燥的黄色墙壁上散发出来，着实刺鼻但又确实稀奇。忽然，一股令人惊奇的香甜味从一张飘飘荡荡的黑门帘后面飘出来。他停了下来，举起自己的前爪，细细品味这香甜的气味。他的身体不受控制似的寻着这股气味朝里走去，他从那张门帘下面钻了进去。随之映入他眼帘的是一个灯光璀璨，高大空旷的前厅，厅中回荡着隆隆的响声。威尔逊一声惊呼，接着用力一拽，便把他拽了回去。于是他们又继续在街上溜达。街上的噪音震耳欲聋，就仿佛所有的人都在同一时刻尖叫着。不同于伦敦街头上那一刻不停的、让人昏昏欲睡的嗡嗡声，这里充斥的是咔嗒声、叫卖声、叮当声、呼喝声、鞭子声、车铃声。弗拉希跳来跳去，忙活个不停，威尔逊也只能跟着他跳来跳去。为了躲开大车和阉牛，以及给正在行进的士兵队伍和山羊群让行，他们不得不在人行道上上来下去，下去上来，反反复复二十次。这么多年以来，没有任何一天像今天这样让他感到自己是那么年轻，那么敏捷。他头晕目眩，但无比兴奋。当他躺在红瓷砖地板上睡觉的时候，感觉比在温珀尔大街的后屋卧室里的枕头上都香甜。

很快，弗拉希就意识到了比萨——现在他们正住在比萨——与伦敦之间更为深刻的区别：比萨的狗跟伦敦的狗不一样。如果是在伦敦，他就算只去邮筒附近溜达一圈儿，也会遇到许多哈巴狗、寻回猎犬、斗牛犬、马斯提夫犬[24]、柯利牧羊犬、纽芬兰犬、圣博尔纳犬、狐犬，或者鼎鼎有名的七种西班尼尔狗中的一种。他能叫出每一种狗的名字，也能给他们划分等级。可是在比萨，虽然也有很多狗，却并没有划分等级，大家全都是——这可能吗？——杂种狗。就他所看见的而言，他们都仅仅是狗而已——灰毛狗、黄毛狗、花纹狗、斑点狗。想从它们里面挑出一只西班尼尔狗、柯利牧羊犬、寻回猎犬或马斯提夫犬是不可能的。难道肯耐尔俱乐部在意大利没有权利来划分狗的等级吗？这里的人不知道西班尼尔俱乐部吗？这里就没有那种规定枕骨突出的狗就要接受死刑的法律吗？或者没有法律规定卷耳朵的狗应该被珍爱，脚上长满绒毛的狗应该被保护，狗的额头必须平滑，绝对不能突出吗？很显然，没有。弗拉希有这样一种感觉，仿佛自己是一位被流放的王子。在这么多的贱民里面，他是唯一的一位贵族，他是整个比萨城里唯一一条纯种的科克尔西班尼尔犬。

这些年来，弗拉希所受到的那些教育，督促他一直视自己为一个贵族。在他的灵魂里面，紫色的饮水罐和铁链定律早已根深蒂固了，如果此时他心灵的天平失去了平衡，那也是情有可原的。流落到泥棚里，与一群土著人共处一室的霍华德、考文迪什[25]不会因为时不时回想起查兹沃斯[26]，缅怀那红色的地毯以及被透过色彩明艳的窗户的火红余晖映照着的挂满王冠的长廊而受到谴责。我们无可否认，弗拉希身上有那么一点势利小人的味道。这一点米特福德小姐在很早以前就看出来了。在伦敦的时候，他生活在一个地位跟他相等甚至比他更高的贵族圈儿里，因此他的势利心态好像没怎么表现出来，可是现在，他觉得自己与众不同，这种势利的态势便燃起了苗头。他变得傲慢无礼了。“弗拉希已经变成了一个专横跋扈的暴君，他想要你把门打开的时候，就会狂叫不止，简直能让你发疯。”勃朗宁夫人写道，“罗伯特说，弗拉希，把他——我的丈夫——看成生来就是为了伺候他的。说起来，好像确实有点这样的迹象呢。”

“罗伯特”“我的丈夫”——要说弗拉希变了，那么巴雷特小姐也和从前判若两人了。她现在不仅称自己为勃朗宁夫人，还让她戴在手上的金戒指在阳光下闪闪发光。她跟弗拉希一样，都变了。“罗伯特”“我的丈夫”，弗拉希每天都能听她念叨个五十来次，而且她的那种引以为豪的语气，每每都让弗拉希颈毛竖起，心跳加速。她的变化可不仅仅是语言上的那些表现，实际上她已经完全变成另外一个人了。从前她喝一小口葡萄酒就直嚷嚷头疼，而现在她可以一口干下一整杯基安蒂[27]，然后美美地进入梦乡。摆在餐桌上的也不再是酸不啦唧的、剥了皮的黄色水果，而是一整枝成熟的橙子。从前她连去摄政公园散散步都要乘坐四轮马车，而现在她可以穿上一双厚靴子去攀登那些大岩石。从前他们会乘坐马车从牛津街上疾驰而过，而现在他们会坐在一辆旧而轻便的马车里，慢慢地行驶，去湖边观赏风景。如果累了，她再不会去叫一辆出租马车，而仅仅是坐在一块石头上，在那里观察一会儿蜥蜴。阳光固然能让她感到快乐，但寒冷也能让她觉得喜悦。天气很冷的时候，她就会把从公爵的森林里砍来的松木一整根都丢进火堆里。在噼噼啪啪的火堆旁，他们相依而坐，一同呼吸着那令人浑身舒泰的芳香。她对意大利赞不绝口，甚至不惜贬低英国。“……我们可怜的英国同胞啊，”她大喊道，“需要教育才能懂得快乐。他们想要变得优雅，需要的并不是火，而是阳光。”阳光给意大利带来了自由、生机和快乐。你不会见到人们打架斗殴，也不会听到人们相互谩骂；你不会看到喝得醉醺醺的意大利人。“在‘滨沟’时看见的那些面孔”一再在她的眼前浮现。她总是拿比萨与伦敦作比较，说自己更喜欢前者。在比萨大街上，美丽的女人完全可以独自出行，那些出生于名门望族的女人们，先把自己的便宜衣服掏空，“带着一脸显而易见的喜悦”到王宫里去。比起温珀尔大街以及那些红木大门和烤羊前腿，她更加喜爱比萨以及这里的钟声、杂种狗、骆驼和松林。所以，每天当勃朗宁夫人喝完基安蒂，然后剥开一个刚从枝上摘下来的橙子时，她就会夸赞意大利，并同时为贫穷、沉闷、潮湿、阴暗、奢华而保守的英国而哀叹连连。

不过，在这段时间里，威尔逊倒是没什么显著变化。那些关于男管家、地下室、大门、窗帘的记忆不会轻易就从她的脑海里祛除掉。甚至在参观美术展览馆时，她的道德准则都会令她被“那不雅的维纳斯惊得连连后退”，中途便退出了展览馆。后来，一个朋友出于善意，允许她从大公的宫殿门口瞧瞧里面那豪华的陈设，可是她一点都不觉得动心，依然视圣詹姆士宫为至高荣耀，忠诚地捍卫着它。她说：“相比我们英国的王宫，它实在显得有些寒酸。”不过，就在她全神贯注地在那儿看的时候，一名无比俊朗的大公侍卫的身影吸引了她的视线，她的芳心开始乱动，她的信念开始动摇，她的准则崩塌了。莉莉·威尔逊深深地爱上了莱伊先生，这位禁卫军军官。

在勃朗宁夫人探索着自己的新自由，并为自己的发现欢欣鼓舞的同时，弗拉希也在进行着他的发现，探索着他的自由。在他们离开比萨前——1847年春天他们搬到了佛罗伦萨——弗拉希曾面对着那稀奇的，一开始令他心烦意乱的事实——肯耐尔俱乐部的法律并不是全世界通行的。现在他总算是可以接受这个事实了，枕骨突出并非就是毋庸置疑的致命缺陷，他还根据这个将自己的准则修正了一番。虽然刚开始的时候他还有些踌躇不定，不过现在已经开始奉行狗社会的新观念了。随着时间一天天过去，他变得越来越民主。离开比萨之前，勃朗宁夫人就观察到“……每天他都出去，跟那些小狗谈话时，用的都是意大利语”。而到了佛罗伦萨，束缚他的枷锁的最后一点残余也都断开了。最终解放的一刻，发生在克赛因公园。当他在“如绿宝石一般的”草地上飞奔，“把野鸡吓得四处扑腾”时，弗拉希猛然回忆起了摄政公园，以及公园里的公告牌：狗必须要戴好铁链。现在，“必须”去哪儿了？铁链去哪儿了？护园者和他的小短棍去哪儿了？随着偷狗贼、白教堂、滨沟、四轮马车和漂亮的出租马车的消失，随着腐朽的贵族所创立的肯耐尔俱乐部和西班尼尔俱乐部的消失，所有的一切都消失了。他在奔跑，在疾驰，他的皮毛闪闪发光，他的眼中火光熊熊，现在他是整个世界的朋友。每一条狗都是他的亲人。在这个全新的世界里，他不需要铁链，不需要保护。要是勃朗宁先生耽误了散步时间——他和弗拉希现在已经是非常要好的朋友了——他就会毫无顾忌地去提醒他。他“站在他的面前叫个不休，活脱脱一副主人的架势”，勃朗宁夫人气哼哼地说——现在，弗拉希跟她的关系已经完全比不上从前了，她不再需要他那火红色的皮毛和明亮的大眼睛给予她自身缺少的某样东西，她已经为自己寻找到了潘神，就在那葡萄园里，就在那橄榄树上，就在夜晚那哔哔啵啵燃烧的松木火堆旁。假如勃朗宁先生耽误了时间，弗拉希就站起来用叫声催促他。当然，如果勃朗宁先生想要待在家里写点东西，那也无妨，弗拉希已经独立了。紫藤花和金链花正在墙头争奇斗艳；南欧紫荆花开满了整个花园；野郁金香的花蕾也正在田野里迎风招展。他干吗非要等呢？他自己便溜了出去，他已经是自己的主人了。“……他独自出门，在外面待上数个小时，”勃朗宁夫人写道，“……他认识佛罗伦萨的每一条街道——他干什么都有自己的一套办法。我不再因为看不见他而感到惊慌。”她补充道，带着一脸的微笑，回忆起温珀尔大街上那段不堪回首的痛苦经历，回忆起那帮随时都准备出击的恶棍，只要她忘记了给弗拉希戴上铁链，他们就会立马把他从马腿下抓走。在佛罗伦萨，人们根本不会害怕。这里没有偷狗贼，这里也没有父亲——虽然很可能她为此叹息过。

但是，弗拉希之所以一瞅见吉第居[28]的房门没关就撒腿跑出去，坦白说，并不是因为他要急着去看图画，或者溜进黑暗的教堂里仰着脖子去看那些壁画，而是因为外面有快乐在召唤他，他要寻求自己多年来牺牲掉的快乐。在伯克郡的田野间，维纳斯的号角就曾吹响过，那时他爱上了帕特里奇先生的狗，后来她还为他生下了一个孩子。那样的号角声如今又在佛罗伦萨这条狭窄的街道上吹响了。沉寂了那么多年后，这个号角声显得更加激烈，更加急迫了。弗拉希明白了人类永远也不会明白的一种东西——最朴素、最纯粹、最完全的爱。这种爱不会给他留下任何烦恼、懊悔和羞惭。这种爱说来就来，说走就走，就像蜜蜂采完蜜，然后就飞走一样。今日是玫瑰，明日是百合花；这一刻还在原野上采野生的蓟花，下一刻又在温室里采装腔作势的口袋模样的兰花。弗拉希拥抱各种各样的母狗，巷子那边的花斑西班尼尔狗，或是那条长有斑纹的狗，又或是那条黄狗——随便哪条都行。对弗拉希来说，她们并没有什么不同。只要号角声搭乘风儿来到耳中，他就会前往那号角吹响的地方。爱就是一切，有了爱就足够了。没有人会指责他这种出格的行为。有时弗拉希深夜才会回来，更甚者第二天早晨才回来，勃朗宁先生看到后就会笑着说：“像他这种有身份的狗，做这种事情未免显得有点不太光彩。”当弗拉希一下子躺倒在卧室的地板上，在镶嵌在大理石地板上的吉第居的族徽上呼呼睡去时，勃朗宁夫人也会哈哈大笑起来。

吉第居的房间里，所有的家具都简洁得毫无赘余。那些昔日她在过着修道院式隐居生活时的帷幔窗帘统统没有了。在这里，床就是床，盥洗台就是盥洗台，任何东西都只是它本身，而不是别的什么。宽敞的客厅里，几把陈旧的乌木雕花椅子摆放在那里，在壁炉的上方悬挂着一面装饰了两个丘比特的镜子以增进照明。勃朗宁夫人也已经扔掉了她那条印度披巾，她头上戴着一顶色彩明艳的薄绸帽，这顶帽子的颜色是她丈夫所喜欢的。她的发型也改变了。当太阳落下，窗户的遮板被打开时，她穿一身薄薄的素白色平纹细布衣服，漫步到阳台上。她喜欢坐在阳台上，倾听大街上那嘈嘈杂杂的说话声，观察那来来往往的行人。

初来佛罗伦萨不久的某个晚上，他们忽然听到大街上响起一阵脚步声，还有人大呼小叫，他们赶紧跑到阳台上去观望到底发生了什么。只见阳台下面的大街上，涌来潮水一般的人群，一边哼唱着一边叫嚷着，每个人手里都拿着一面小旗子。每一家的窗口都有脑袋探出来，每一家的阳台上都站满了人。人们将一把把鲜花和桂树叶从窗口抛向大街上的人群，街上的人们——不论是一脸肃穆的男人，还是一脸喜悦的年轻女人——互相亲吻着，还把他们手臂中的小孩儿高高举起，朝阳台上的人们致意。勃朗宁先生和勃朗宁夫人都把身子探出栏杆，一个劲地鼓掌。在火炬的光亮下，那一面面写着“殉难者永生”“意大利联邦”“自由”“比奥·侬诺万岁”和“列奥波尔多二世万岁”的小旗子从下面飘荡而过——这样的场面一直持续了三个半小时，人们的欢呼声和小旗子不断地从下面流过。勃朗宁先生和勃朗宁夫人在阳台上点了六支蜡烛，并且一个劲地挥手。有那么一会儿，连弗拉希都跑来凑热闹，挤在他们俩中间，把自己的前爪探出阳台的栏杆，挥来挥去以示庆祝。不过，最终——困倦占据了上风——他哈欠连天。“他终于承认他嫌他们闹腾得太久了。”勃朗宁夫人评价道。倦意一阵阵袭来，他对那些粗俗的笑话感到十分疑惑。这一切都是为了什么？他问自己，这位大公是谁？他承诺了什么？他们为什么都这么没头没脑地乱激动？勃朗宁夫人总是在下面有旗帜经过时就可劲儿地挥手，不知道怎么回事，他居然被她那种热情劲儿给惹恼了。他觉得他们对那个大公的热情已经超出他能容忍的范围了。当大公经过这里的时候，他注意到一条停在门口的小狗，于是他趁着勃朗宁夫人沉浸在兴奋中的当儿，瞅了个机会偷偷下了阳台，跑到了外面。他从人群和旗帜当中穿梭过去，在那只小狗后面紧随不舍。她朝着市中心的方向跑去了，于是他们越跑越远，渐渐地，人们的欢呼声、叫喊声越来越远、越来越弱了，最后连火把的光也看不见了。仅有一两颗星星倒映在亚诺河的涟漪中，忽明忽暗。弗拉希跟那条花斑西班尼尔狗相互依偎着躺在河边的一只破破烂烂的箩筐里，箩筐下面是一摊稀泥。他们爱意浓浓，尽情缠绵，直到第二天的太阳升起来。弗拉希回到家时，已经是上午九点钟了，勃朗宁夫人跟他打招呼时，用的是一种奚落的口吻——她觉得，他至少应该记得今天是她结婚一周年的纪念日。不过，她猜想：“他肯定是过得非常愉快。”一点不假。当四万人的脚步声和旗帜上慷慨激昂的标语以及大公的誓言令她沉浸在莫名其妙的满足中时，弗拉希以无限的热情爱上了门口的那条小狗。

毫无疑问，勃朗宁夫人和弗拉希在各自的生活旅程中所发现的东西是不同的——她目睹了一位大公的出现，而他结识了一条花狗——但是必须承认的是，那条曾经将他们联系在一起的纽带依然发挥着作用。弗拉希再也不用遵守那些“必须”，他在克赛因公园那绿宝石一样的野草地里无拘无束地奔跑着，将金色的、红色的野鸡惊得乱飞乱窜。不过没多久，他便发觉自己不能再这样放肆下去。他不得不再一次蹲在家里。最初并没有发生什么事——仅仅是一种征兆——1849年春天，勃朗宁夫人开始在家里忙着做针线活儿了。弗拉希真的看到了某些变化，所以才暂时不敢往外乱跑了。勃朗宁夫人并不擅长针线活儿。弗拉希看到，威尔逊挪开一张床，把一些白色的衣服装进了一个抽屉里。他把头从瓷砖地上抬起来，聚精会神地观望着，聆听着。又要发生什么事情了吗？他不安地四处察看，想从箱子和行李被打开的痕迹中找到一点证据。他们又要再次远走高飞、逃之夭夭了吗？可是，这次要逃往哪里呢？要躲避的东西又是什么呢？这里没有什么东西让人恐惧啊。他安慰勃朗宁夫人，叫她不要害怕。在佛罗伦萨，他和她都没必要害怕泰勒先生，或者害怕包裹着狗脑袋的牛皮纸包。不过他依然感到茫然不安，他看出来了，所有这些变化的蛛丝马迹，都跟逃跑毫无关系，而是一种更为神秘的期待。每当他看到勃朗宁夫人静悄悄地坐在她的低椅上做针线活儿的时候，他就感到，有一种可怕的东西正在接近，而且无法逃避。时间就这样一星期接一星期地过去了，勃朗宁夫人不再出门了，她坐在家里，就好像在等待某件大事发生。难道，有一个像泰勒那样的恶棍要出现了，而她打算孤身一人，不借助任何帮助去阻击他，去接下他那暴风雨一般的拳头吗？想到这儿，弗拉希激灵地打了个冷战。行李箱没有收拾好，显然，她并没有打算逃走，也没有离开这所房子的打算。看起来更像是有人要来到这里了。他嫉妒不已，焦躁难安。每一个新来的人，他都要细细地观察一番。现在这里多了许多新来的人——布莱格登小姐、兰道先生、海迪·霍斯梅尔、利顿先生——现在有许多的女士和先生到吉第居来。日子一天又一天地过去，勃朗宁夫人一直坐在她的扶手椅上，安静地缝纫着。

时间到了三月份，月初的某一天，勃朗宁夫人索性都不到客厅里来了。倒是有不少其他的人在这里一个劲进进出出，勃朗宁先生和威尔逊也在这里忙活个不停。弗拉希紧张地缩在沙发底下，看着他们慌乱失常地走进走出。人们一个劲地在楼梯上上上下下，喊人的时候竭力压低嗓门儿，并用一种非常罕见的不出声的声音交谈。他们在楼上的卧室里忙活。他藏在沙发底下，一点点地向后退缩，一直挪动到最黑暗的犄角里。他身体的每一个神经都感受得到，某些重大的变化已经发生了——某个可怕的事件正在逼近。记得几年前，他就像现在这样，等待着楼梯上响起那个戴风帽的人的脚步声，门开以后，巴雷特小姐就叫了一声“勃朗宁先生！”这一次又是谁来了？是一个什么样的戴风帽的人呢？一整天过去了，他彻彻底底地被抛弃了。他躺在客厅里，不吃不喝。可能已经有一千只花西班尼尔狗在门口嗅过了，可此时此刻他只想躲开她们。随着时间的推移，他那种感觉越来越强烈，好像有什么东西正在从外面进入这所房间里。他从沙发罩的荷叶边向外探视，烛台上的丘比特，乌木箱子，法国式椅子，一切都好像散架了似的。他还有一种感觉，就好像有某种力量正在推着他向墙根儿贴近，好给他看不见的某个东西让出空间来。勃朗宁先生下来过一次，不过那已经不再是原先的那个勃朗宁先生了。威尔逊也下来过一次，当然她也发生了变化——就好像他们都看见了那个他看不到但感觉到了的东西。

最后，威尔逊满脸通红，披头散发地从楼上下来，喜气洋洋地将他抱进怀里，上了楼。他们走进了卧室。一阵小羊羔似的轻飘飘的啼哭声从昏暗的房间中传来——有一个东西正在枕头上微微动弹。那是一个活物，是一个独立的生命个体，大门一直紧闭着，勃朗宁夫人在这间房子里由一个人变成了两个人。那个可恶的小生命在她的身旁不停地蠕动着，一个劲地啼哭。弗拉希嫉妒得发狂，心里的那股厌恶情绪再也压制不住，他挣脱了威尔逊，飞快地跑到楼下去。威尔逊和勃朗宁夫人唤回了他。他们抚摸他，给他好吃的点心，以此诱惑他，可是这些都无济于事，他拼命地逃离着这个可恶的小东西，这个令人生厌的存在，无论是阴暗的沙发底，还是黑暗的旮旯儿，只要看得见，他就跑进去躲起来。“……对于所有殷勤安抚，他都不予理睬，他忧郁了，并且深陷其中，不可自拔。这种情况足足持续了两个星期。”——尽管勃朗宁夫人手头有很多事情要忙，但是她还是注意到了这一点。如果我们在狗的大脑里加入我们人类自己的时间概念，我们将会看到，人类的一分钟，在狗意识里如何膨胀成了一小时；人类的一小时，又如何膨胀成狗的一整天。所以，我们可以毫不夸张地说，弗拉希那“深深的忧郁”持续了堪比人类概念中六个月的时间之长。而在比这更短的时间里，很多的人却已经把他们的爱或恨忘却了。

不过弗拉希再不是温珀尔大街上的那条什么也没学过、没经受过任何训练的狗了。他已经学习过他的情感教育课程了。他被威尔逊打过，还曾经在迫不得已的情况下吃下过发了霉的旧蛋糕，而那块蛋糕他本可以在它还是新鲜的时候就享用的，他只需要表示已经下定决心爱勃朗宁先生，再也不会去咬他。在沙发底下躺着的时候，他的脑海里就一个劲地翻腾着这些陈年旧事。他终于还是走出来了。为此，他又一次获得了褒奖。一开始，即便他并不讨厌这种褒奖，不过，不可否认，他也不觉得这种褒奖有多少分量。那个婴儿被放在他的背上，他的耳朵被那双小手拉着，他轻轻地、慢吞吞地跑着，他乖乖地顺从着，就算耳朵被拉疼了，他也只是回头“吻一吻那双尽是肉窝窝的小脚丫”。不到三个月的时间，那个柔柔弱弱，只会哇哇大哭的小不点就喜欢上他了。“大概的情况就是这样的。”勃朗宁夫人跟别人谈起的时候，这样说道。令弗拉希感到奇怪的是，没过多长时间，他自己也开始喜欢那个小不点了。难道他们没有什么共同之处吗——在那个孩子身上，不是有很多方面跟弗拉希酷似吗？他们不是拥有同样的见解，同样的品位吗？比如就风景问题而言。在弗拉希的眼里，所有的风景都是没什么意义的。这么多年来他从未学会将注意力集中到那重重的山岗上。当他们带着他去瓦隆布罗萨[29]游玩的时候，他看到那壮阔的树林感到的只是无聊。小不点几个月大的时候，他们又进行了一次长途探险活动，乘坐一辆马车去旅行。小不点躺在保姆的膝盖上，弗拉希坐在勃朗宁夫人的膝盖上。马车行进着，艰难地攀越着亚平宁山脉高高的山岗。勃朗宁夫人实在太开心了，她几乎不舍得离开车窗，她觉得即便把所有的英语词汇翻一遍，也不一定能找出有分量的词语来表达她现在的感受。“亚平宁山脉那如梦似幻般的景色，那不断变换的色彩和线条，那有着自身明显特色的每一座山岗，以及不同山岗的美景的突然转换，那被自身重量压得弯腰驼背而把枝杈探进深谷的栗子林，那被湍流撕裂或者劈开的岩石，还有那如同自己堆积起来，竞赛般不断改变着自身颜色的层峦叠嶂的山峰”——那些数量众多的新颖的词汇，因为亚平宁山脉的美景而诞生，以至于另一部分词汇被挤得失去了存在的空间。可是，小不点和弗拉希对于这种刺激都没有一点感觉，也都没觉得有一点儿遗憾。他们俩都保持着缄默。弗拉希“从车窗口收回自己的脑袋，对于窗外的美景表现出一副兴致缺缺的样子……什么山岗啦、树木啦，以及其他的什么，所引起的仅仅只是他的鄙夷”，勃朗宁夫人下了结论。马车隆隆地前行着，弗拉希睡着了，小不点儿也睡着了。最后他们来到一个村庄里，车窗外不断有灯光、房屋和人群闪现，弗拉希立马就警觉起来。“他把一双警觉的眼睛瞪得圆溜溜的，这边瞅瞅，那边瞧瞧。你一准儿会认为，他这是在做笔记，或者准备要做笔记了。”打动他是因为这里出现了人，而绝非是因为美景风光。美景至少会先凝聚成绿色或紫色的结晶粉，再由自然界的某种注射器吹送进弗拉希鼻孔后面的某条通道，触及他的感官，这时候他就会陷入一种难以言说的狂喜之中。凡是勃朗宁夫人需要用眼睛看的，用笔写的，他一律用鼻子来嗅。

这篇传记写到这里，作者必须要作一下停顿了。要恰如其分地描摹一下我们所看到的一切，两三千字是远远不够的——勃朗宁夫人无法否认，她已经被亚平宁山脉给征服了。“我没有办法告诉你这些东西的任何一点细枝末节。”她承认——如果要描述我们所闻到的东西，只需要三个半字就够了，人类的鼻子简直不存在。世界上最伟大的诗人，只是能闻到马粪的臭气和玫瑰花的香气。在这两者之间还存在着无数种他们无法辨别出来的气味。可是弗拉希不同，他所生活的那个世界，就是由各种各样的气味所构成的，爱情大部分是气味，形状、色彩是气味，音乐、建筑、法律、政治、科学全都是气味。对他来说，所谓的宗教也不过只是一种气味。即便只是想将他每天吃排骨和吃饼干这一类最简单的感受描述出来，我们也无能为力。甚至连斯温伯恩先生[30]也说不出一个六月的炎炎下午，温珀尔大街的气味于弗拉希而言究竟意味着什么。要想描述混杂在火把、桂花、焚香、旗帜、蜡烛和被带有樟脑味儿的缎面儿鞋的鞋跟儿踩烂的玫瑰花瓣编成的花环的气味中的一条西班尼尔狗的气味，或许只有莎士比亚才能做到吧，前提是他在写他的悲剧《安东尼与克丽奥佩特拉》的时候能够停下笔来，然而莎士比亚并没有停过笔。我们无法否认我们的鼻子确实很迟钝，我们所能够记下的只是：尽管弗拉希一生中最自由、最幸福、最充实的时光是在意大利度过的，但是对他来说，意大利的真实含义也只不过是一系列各种各样的气味。不妨这样设想，尽管爱情的吸引力正在逐渐淡去，但是气味的吸引力依然存在。他们选择在吉第居生活以后，每个人就都有了自己要干的事情，勃朗宁先生每天都有一个固定的时间要在一间屋子里写作，同样，勃朗宁夫人每天也有一个固定的时间要在另一间屋子里写作，他们的孩子在育儿室里玩耍，而弗拉希则在佛罗伦萨的大街上逍遥自在，享受着那使他迷醉的气味。他循着气味，穿过主干道和后街，穿过广场和小巷。他循着气味，从一种气味到另一种气味，一路前行，他跑过坑坑洼洼的路面，也到过光滑平坦的大道，他跑过黑暗的街道，也到过洒满金黄阳光的街道。他跑进跑出，跑上跑下。他跑到人们吹奏铜管乐器的地方，跑到人们烤面包的地方，跑到女人们坐着梳头的地方，跑到摞着高高的鸟笼的堤道上，跑到洒落着深红色葡萄酒的人行道上，跑到充斥着皮革、马具和大蒜气味的地方，跑到捣衣的地方，跑到葡萄藤摇曳摆拂的地方，跑到男人们喝酒、吐痰、赌博的地方——他不断地进进出出，把鼻子凑到地面上，在香气的海洋里痛饮，或者他也会把鼻子仰起来，迎着飘荡过来的阵阵香气抽动鼻翼。他躺在一块阳光曝晒的土地上——连石头都被太阳烤得冒气！他寻到一条阴凉的隧道——凉森森的石头上散发着一股酸味！他喜欢葡萄那紫色的味道，所以一口就将一整串葡萄都吞下；意大利主妇们把那些已经变硬了的吃剩下的羊肉片或通心粉丢下阳台，他嚼了一会儿又吐出来——羊肉和通心粉的气味是刺鼻的、深红色的。他循着令人宁静放松的焚香的味道，跑进昏沉沉的教堂中复杂难辨的紫罗兰色当中；他的鼻子可劲儿地嗅来嗅去，来到一块墓地，他去舔了那装着彩色玻璃的坟墓上的金子。他的触觉跟他的嗅觉一样灵敏。在他所熟悉的佛罗伦萨，既有大理石的光滑，也有砂石的粗糙。他用舌头去舔，用颤动的鼻子去触那年深日久已经发白的帷幕的褶皱和那光滑的石头雕像的手脚。他也会把那值得炫耀一番的拉丁铭文清晰地印在他那非常敏感的脚掌上。总而言之，弗拉希对佛罗伦萨这个地方的认知与人类大相径庭。他的佛罗伦萨，拉斯金[31]不了解，乔治·艾略特[32]也不了解。只有哑巴才能了解他所了解的东西。他那无穷无尽的感觉，没有一种是用语言来表述的，因此也不会受到语言的曲解。

写这部传记的作者，虽然可以轻描淡写地猜测说：弗拉希进入中年以后，就一直生活在这种不可思议的极致快乐中。但是，假如硬要说就在那个小不点一天天长大，开始牙牙学语，并拥有弗拉希不能理解的感情时，弗拉希就必定要永远生活在一个天堂里，在这个天堂里，香气是以最纯粹的形式存在的，事物赤裸裸的本质直接凌驾于他那毫无遮掩的神经之上，那就大错特错了。据我们所知，弗拉希并没有生活在这样的天堂里，像那样完美的幸福生活，也许只有那些徜徉在星空里的神明，或者那些从来没有到过人类集居地，只是不远万里飞往那白雪皑皑的极地冰原或热带的丛林上空的鸟儿，才能够享受到。至于弗拉希，他在人的膝盖上躺过，听到过人类的声音，他的身上沾满了人类的情感。另外，无论是哪种程度的嫉妒、愤怒和绝望，在他的身上都曾体现过。现在是夏天，弗拉希遭受着跳蚤的蹂躏。太阳催熟葡萄的同时也带来了跳蚤，这是多么严酷的讽刺啊！“弗拉希在佛罗伦萨的夏天所受到的煎熬，不见得就逊色于萨伏那罗拉[33]的殉难。”勃朗宁夫人这样写道。跳蚤栖息横行在佛罗伦萨每一栋房子的任何一个犄角旮旯里。那些古老的石头缝里，或者旧挂毯的褶皱里，斗篷里，毯子里，都有可能蹦出跳蚤来。它们在弗拉希的皮毛里安家，它们一直往他的皮毛深处叮咬。他抓啊挠啊，擦啊蹭啊。他的健康受到了威胁。他终日闷闷不乐，瘦得骨架都突显出来了，还发起了高烧。勃朗宁夫人求助米特福德小姐，向她咨询除跳蚤的方法。米特福德小姐还是坐在三里口的那间温室里，继续写着她的悲剧，她暂时把笔搁下，开始查阅自己的旧药方——五月花有什么药效，玫瑰花蕾有什么药效……可事实是，雷丁的跳蚤只要一小撮药就死了，但佛罗伦萨的跳蚤则是红色壮汉，米特福德小姐的药粉对这种跳蚤，根本没什么用。绝望中，勃朗宁夫妇只能跪在水桶边，想方设法用刷子和肥皂来祛除这种害虫，可是到头来只是白费力气。有一天，勃朗宁先生带着弗拉希出去遛弯儿时，注意到人们对着弗拉希指指点点，还有一个人把一根手指举到鼻子边小声说“疥癣”。当时，“罗伯特对弗拉希的喜爱已经像我一样”，因此，他等于是正带着一个朋友出来散步，却听到别人羞辱自己的朋友，这当然是无法容忍的。罗伯特“再也忍不住了”，他的妻子如此写道。只有最后一个办法没有尝试过，但这个办法的残酷本质跟那种疾病本身相比也不遑多让了。尽管弗拉希现在已经变得民主了许多，对于阶级地位的标志也不像以前那么在乎了，可是他依然是菲利普·西德尼[34]所说的“天生的绅士”，皮毛对于他来说，就是披挂在身上的血统荣耀。究其意义，就如同那倾家荡产的落魄乡绅揣在衣兜里的铭刻着家族徽记的金表一样。然而勃朗宁先生现在打算牺牲掉他的皮毛。他把弗拉希叫到身前，“拿出一把剪刀，把他剪得简直跟一只狮子一样”。

随着勃朗宁先生手里的剪刀开开合合，标志着科克尔西班尼尔狗的徽记，一撮撮地飘落到地上。当那个模仿其他动物的标志在脖子上凸显出来的时候，弗拉希觉得自己像是被阉割了一样，变得渺小，羞愤难当。我现在是个什么东西呢？他照镜子的时候想。“你什么都不是了。”镜子无情地拿事实回答了他。他什么都算不上了，他理所当然不再是一条科克尔西班尼尔狗了。他凝视着镜子，他的耳朵秃了，不卷了，好像还在痉挛，就像是代表真实和滑稽的精灵正在他耳边低语。他什么都不是了，难道这不正是世界上最让人满意的地位吗？他又朝镜子里瞅了瞅，看见了他脖子上套着的那只项圈。画漫画去讽刺那些自恃清高的人——不也是一种职业吗？无论如何，他身上的跳蚤总算是没了，至于怎么看那个问题已经不重要了。他摇晃着他的脖子，舞动着他那赤裸的瘦弱腿脚。他变得异常开心。就像一个久病初愈的美人，发现自己永久性地毁容了，于是生起一堆篝火，开开心心地在大笑声中把衣服和胭脂水粉统统丢进火堆里，心想，以后完全没必要再照镜子了，也不用再为情敌的阴冷和妒忌惴惴不安了。就像一位牧师终于可以将那件穿了二十多年已经浆洗得硬邦邦的长袍丢进垃圾桶里，并一把从书橱里抓起伏尔泰[35]的大作——弗拉希此时此刻的感受，或许只有这样的美人和牧师才能够理解。就这样，弗拉希全身上下被剪得光秃秃的，像一头狮子似的，惊惶而走，但他终于摆脱跳蚤了。“弗拉希，”勃朗宁夫人在写给妹妹的信中说道，“是明智的。”或许她是想到了希腊的一句至理名言：“想要得到幸福，就必先经历痛苦！”虽然它失去了皮毛，但也除掉了跳蚤。他是一个真正的哲学家。

但是这件事没过多久，弗拉希刚刚学会的哲学知识就遭到了考验。1852年夏天，吉第居又出现了上两次危机静悄悄来临的迹象：抽屉打开了，或是一根细绳从箱子里漏了出来。当一条狗看到这些迹象的紧张程度就好比牧羊人看到预示着雷雨的乌云，政治家听到战争即将爆发的谣言。某些变化又要来了，新的旅行即将开始了。可是究竟有什么事要发生呢？箱子已经拉下来绑好了，保姆把孩子抱了出来。勃朗宁先生和勃朗宁夫人穿着要出远门的衣服一起现身。门口停着一辆出租马车。弗拉希像个哲学家一般在门厅里冷静地等候着。他们做好准备的时候，他也准备好了。他们坐到马车上之后，他也轻轻一跃，跳上了马车。这次是威尼斯？罗马？还是巴黎——他们将要去往何处？现在所有的国家在他眼里都是平等的；所有的人类都是他的兄弟。他已经学会了这一课。但当他最终从一片朦胧中，跳下马车时，他需要运用他所学到的全部哲学知识了——他来到了伦敦。

街道的两旁，全都是砖瓦房。他走在硬邦邦、冷冰冰的人行道上。一个穿着紫色长毛绒大衣的女人，从一扇带有黄铜把手的红木门里走出来。她的头上戴着一个轻巧的花环。当男仆蹲下来，放置好一辆四轮马车的登车凳时，她提了提衣服，朝着街道的两端望了两眼，目光中带着一种轻蔑。这里是维尔贝克大街——整条大街都被一种红色的光芒笼罩着——这种红光与意大利那种醒目的红光截然不同，带着一点茶色，沾染着成千上万的车轮和马蹄荡起的尘土，显得模模糊糊的。现在正是伦敦举行社交活动的大好季节，在城市的上空，汇聚着各种各样的声音，形成一种嘈杂的嗡鸣声。一个侍从手里握着一条铁链，铁链的另一头，是一条雄壮的猎鹿犬。一个警察迈着轻快的步伐，大步流星地走来，举着他的牛眼灯四处探照。炖肉的香味、牛肉的香味、烤肉的油味、卷心菜炖牛肉的香味，从成千上万的地下室里飘荡出来。一个身着号衣的仆人将一封信投进了邮箱。

弗拉希在门口停住了，他被这个大城市震慑住了，被它的奢华跟大气震慑住了。威尔逊也停住了。这一刻，意大利的王室、意大利的文明、意大利的革命，还有意大利的大公跟侍卫，都变得微不足道！当那名警察走过来时，威尔逊在心中向上帝致谢，幸好她没有嫁给莱伊先生！与此同时，从街头拐角的小酒馆里蹿出一个不祥的身影，他向这边瞥了一眼，弗拉希赶紧钻进了屋子里。

一连好几个星期，他都只能待在维尔贝克大街上一所租来的房子里，活动范围仅限于客厅。监禁是有必要的。最近霍乱正在流行，不过说实话，那些贫民窟在这场霍乱中反倒是受益良多，有些情况略微得到了改善。不过，这种改善显然远远不够，因为仍旧有狗不断丢失，温珀尔大街的狗还是得用铁链拴好。当然，弗拉希有着自己的社交活动，他与其他的狗在邮筒附近或酒吧外面会晤。对于这位重返伦敦的新贵，它们表示十分欢迎，它们都有着很不错的教养，这是从祖先那里一代代传承下来的。这就好比某个英国贵族，长久地生活在东方，进而沾染了一些当地人的陋习——并且有传闻，说他成了伊斯兰教的教徒，变成了一个穆斯林，还跟一个中国的洗衣婆生了个儿子——当他坐回宫廷里的时候，老朋友们都愿意针对他的过失予以宽容并邀请他到查兹沃斯来，尽管他们都避免提及他的妻子，并知道他定会同他家人一起祷告忏悔一样——温珀尔大街的狗，不论是那些指示犬还是那些赛特狗，都对他的归来表示欢迎，没有在意他的皮毛状况。但，现在弗拉希反而觉得，伦敦的狗怎么看都好像有点不正常。内罗——克莱尔夫人的那条狗，大家都知道，有一次它居然从顶楼的窗户跳下来，试图自杀，据说它是因为感到奇恩路的生活太焦虑了才这么做的。重返维尔贝克大街的弗拉希对这条消息是深信不疑的，被监禁，和一堆乱七八糟的破玩意儿挤在一起，夜晚的蟑螂，白日的绿苍蝇，徘徊回荡的羊肉香味，餐橱上一年四季都不缺的香蕉——所有的这一切，加之常跟那些衣冠楚楚，却从来不把衣服洗干净的男男女女打交道，使得他脾气变得格外暴躁，神经也跟着紧张起来。他一连好几个小时躺在五屉柜的下面，他想从这间租来的屋子里跑出去是不可能的，因为前门总是锁着的。他只能等着某个人拿着铁链来牵他出去。

只有两件事情打断过他在伦敦度过的这段枯燥乏味的生活。夏季的某天，勃朗宁夫妇要去法南姆，拜访住在那里的查尔斯·金斯利牧师。在这个季节，意大利的土地一定是一片不毛之地了，会变得跟砖头一样硬，还会有到处肆虐的跳蚤，人们会尽可能地避开火炉似的太阳，走路的时候跟行尸走肉似的，拖着身子从一片阴影挪向另一片阴影，哪怕是看见某座出自多纳泰罗[36]之手的雕像上抬起的胳膊在地上投下的阴影，人们也会感恩戴德。但是在法南姆这片土地上，满眼都是绿油油的田野，天蓝色的水塘，还有那低声细语的树林。在这样的草地上，他的脚爪踩上去感觉太有弹性了，太绵软凉爽了。勃朗宁跟金斯利，这两家人一起享受了这样的一天。当弗拉希跟在他们后面跑来跑去的时候，他再次听见了昔日的号角声，那种逝去的狂喜又回来了——是野兔还是狐狸？他撒腿狂奔入萨里的荒野，自打离开三里口以后，弗拉希就再也没有真正跑过一次了。一只野鸡带着它那五颜六色的羽翎飞起来的时候，像箭一般快，他差一点就咬到了它的尾巴。然后他就听到了一声鞭响，听到了一声呼喝。难道是查尔斯·金斯利牧师在制止他吗？不管是不是，他最终还是停了下来。在法南姆，对于森林的保护是非常严格的。

没过几天，正当弗拉希躺在维尔贝克大街家里的客厅里时，勃朗宁夫人走了进来，她穿着一身要出远门的衣服，把弗拉希从五屉柜的下面唤出来，并把一条铁链套在他的脖子上。自1846年九月之后，时隔六年，他们再次一道踏上了温珀尔大街，来到了50号门口。就像从前一样，他们停下来，等待着；就像从前一样，管家不紧不慢地过来开门。门开了，俯卧在那条席子上的不正是卡蒂琳吗？这条已经老得没了牙的狗打了个哈欠，伸了个懒腰，看都没有看弗拉希一眼。就像从前走下这道楼梯时一样，而今他们蹑手蹑脚地走上去，寂静无声。勃朗宁夫人就像害怕看到那些即将看到的东西似的，悄悄地轻轻推开一扇又一扇的门。她从一间屋子出来，又进入另一间屋子。忧郁慢慢地将她笼罩。“……这些屋子似乎比以前更昏暗，更狭小了，”她写道，“放置在那儿的家具也让人觉得不太合适，不太方便。”后屋，常春藤依旧轻轻抽打着玻璃窗，那射来的光线仍旧被印花窗帘遮挡住。这么多年来，什么都没有变，什么事都没有发生。她一间间地挨个儿察看这些屋子，满满的回忆，满满的忧伤。弗拉希在她查看这些屋子的时候，已经急得如热锅上的蚂蚁了，如果巴雷特先生突然回来发现他们该怎么办？如果他皱起眉头盯着他们，然后把他们锁回后屋的卧室里，永远不让他们出来，该怎么办？好在，勃朗宁夫人把所有的门都关上了，再一次静默无声地从楼梯上走下来。是的，她说，应该打扫一下这些屋子了。

从那天以后，弗拉希就只有一个愿望——离开伦敦，离开英国，永远不要再回来。直到他意识到自己已经站在了穿越英吉利海峡去往法国的渡轮甲板上时，他才一改闷闷不乐的状态。这是一段非常难受的旅程。穿越海峡总共要花八个小时的时间。随着渡轮在大海里颠晃前行，弗拉希的回忆就像一团纷沓繁杂的乱麻，他又想起那个穿着长毛绒大衣的女人；那些拎着行囊衣衫褴褛的男人；摄政公园；在护卫队的簇拥下匆匆经过他们面前的维多利亚女王；英国的绿草丛和弥漫着刺鼻气味的英国人行道。这林林总总的画景，在他的脑海里一一重现，又一一消失。当他抬起头的时候，发现栏杆那儿靠着一个人，那是个个头挺拔，表情凝重的人。

“克莱尔先生！”他听见勃朗宁夫人叫道。这时——请记住，穿越海峡是一次非常痛苦的经历——弗拉希猛烈地呕吐了起来。水手们拎着拖把和水桶跑过来。“……他被命令离开甲板，可怜的狗儿。”勃朗宁夫人说，因为甲板是英国的，生病的狗都不准待在甲板上。可是他偏偏生病了。这就是他送给祖国的最后敬意。





第六章　尾声


弗拉希现在已经是一条老狗了。英国的那趟旅程，所唤起的回忆，无疑让他倍感疲倦。人们注意到了，从那里归来后，他对阳光开始疏远了，总是寻找阴凉的地方休息，虽然比起温珀尔大街的阳光，佛罗伦萨的阴凉可能还要燥热一些。他经常摊开四肢趴在一座雕像下，或者蜷缩起身子，待在喷泉下方一连睡上好几个小时，只为了等待那些时不时溅落在身上的水滴。还有不少小狗经常来找他。他就给他们讲白教堂和温珀尔大街的故事，讲三叶草和牛津街的气味，讲在他的记忆中接二连三所发生的那些变革，讲大公们如何来临，又如何离开。当然，那条住在小巷左边的花西班尼尔狗，据他说，是永远地走了。有时，兰道先生，那个脾气火暴的家伙急匆匆地从他身边走过，还佯装发火冲他亮下他的拳头。善良的伊莎·布兰戈登小姐，则每每在他身边驻足，从手提袋里掏出几块饼干来喂他。集市上的农妇们会在她们竹筐的阴凉处用一些树叶给他铺个小床，并时常扔一两串葡萄给他吃。在佛罗伦萨，他人尽皆知，他被所有人喜爱——无论是高贵的绅士，还是平民百姓，无论是人，还是狗。

可是弗拉希终究还是老了。他甚至不愿意再躺在喷泉下——那里的鹅卵石硌得他的骨头生疼——而是待在勃朗宁夫人的房间里那镶嵌在地板上的用光滑的人造大理石做成的吉第居的家族徽记上，或是客厅里那张大桌子下的那一片阴影里。从伦敦归来后不久的一天，他在那张桌子下沉沉地睡着，四仰八叉地张着四条腿，这样没有梦境，昏昏沉沉的睡眠只有那种上了年纪的狗才会有。说实在的，他如今的睡眠比以往更加深沉了，当他睡着了，会感觉到周围的黑暗越来越致密。如果说还会做梦，那么他多半会梦到自己躺在那寂静无声、连阳光也透不进来的原始森林深处。当然，偶尔他也会梦见昏昏欲睡的鸟儿所发出的那种充满倦意的叫声，或者一只静悄悄坐在那里的猴子在树枝被烈风摇动时所发出的温和笑声。

忽然间，光线撑开枝叶，攒射进来——四面八方全都是耀目的光束，猴子们吱吱叫着，鸟儿们惊飞起来，叽喳吵闹，与同类遥相呼应。弗拉希嗖一下站起来，困顿一扫而光，他周围的一切都变得混乱不堪。刚刚他在客厅桌子下面那几条滑溜溜的桌腿中间睡着了，可是现在围着他的却是不停翻涌着的裤腿和裙子，就连那张桌子也在摇来晃去，猛烈地动荡。他该往哪里逃跑？究竟发生了什么事？鬼知道这张桌子被下了什么咒语。他发出一声高亢的长啸，想问一问这是怎么回事。

关于弗拉希这些问题，我们没法提供让人满意的答案。但是我们知道一些事实，而这些事实完全没有经过加工处理。事情大概是这样的：在十九世纪初，布莱西顿伯爵夫人有一个水晶球，是从某个魔法师那里买来的。这位贵妇人“压根就不知道它有什么妙用”，她只看到了水晶本身而已，除此之外并没有发现任何其他的东西在球里面。她去世以后，她的财产被变卖了，这个水晶球落入了那些“拥有一双更加纯澈的眼睛，能够看得更加通透”的人们手中，他们发现了球中除水晶之外的别的某些东西。至于买下这个水晶球的人是不是斯坦赫普勋爵，他是否真的拥有“一双更加纯澈的眼睛”，我们就不得而知了。但可以肯定的是，1852年，斯坦赫普勋爵确实拥有一个水晶球，他只需往里一看，便能够在球里看见混杂在其他物质中的“太阳的精灵”。一个热情好客的贵族人士，理所当然不会独自欣赏那种奇景。斯坦赫普勋爵习惯在午宴上炫耀自己的水晶球或是邀请友人们来观看“太阳的精灵”。欣赏水晶球里的奇景确实是一件乐事，因此，在当时，人们对水晶球的热度一下就高涨起来了。不过，伦敦的一位十分幸运的眼镜制造商乔利先生对此态度却十分漠然。他发现，不需要是埃及人，也用不着去找魔法师，他自己就能制造出这种水晶球，尽管当时英国的水晶相当昂贵。于是，时间到了五十年代初期那会儿，有不少人都拥有了水晶球。尽管如斯坦赫普勋爵所说的一样，这些人“虽然在使用水晶球，可是没有一个人敢承认”。在伦敦，关于精灵，真的是闹得满城风雨，甚至还引起了某种恐慌。于是，斯坦赫普勋爵建议爱德华·里顿爵士“为了详细了解事情的真相，政府应该指定一个调查委员会”。不知是精灵被将要派遣调查专员的传言给吓坏了，还是精灵自身有血有肉，要聚在一起才容易繁衍后代——这样的问题我们无法求证，但是有一点是真的，精灵们变得惶惶不可终日，成批地逃到了桌子腿里。当时的那些人出于一种什么样的动机我们不用去管，关键是这个举措效果非常好。虽然水晶贵重无比，但桌子却家家都有。就这样，1852年冬天，当勃朗宁夫人返回意大利的时候，就发现精灵比她早到了一步，这时候佛罗伦萨每一张桌子都成了精灵的栖身所。勃朗宁夫人写道：“人们四处奔波，都在‘为桌子劳心费神’，上至大公使臣，下至药贩子，人们在桌子周围围成一圈，却并不是在玩惠斯特[37]。”那是在破解桌腿里传递出来的秘信。桌子能够“用它的腿敲击地面，将它的见解以字母表的顺序表达出来，非常聪颖”。如果一张桌子能够说出你的孩子已经四岁了，那还有什么是它办不到的呢？旋转桌成为商店里最热门的货物，墙壁上到处都张贴着广告，到了1854年，这个运动发展得如此迅捷，以至于“四十多万个说得出名姓的美国家庭……醉心于同精灵的交往之中”。连英国那边也有消息传来，声称爱德华·巴尔沃-里顿爵士购买了“许多种美国的敲打精灵”到他的内布沃斯庄园，并带来了令人愉快的结果：爵士相信自己变成了一个隐形人——某一天吃早饭的时候，小亚瑟·罗素看见“有一个老头子，穿着一件寒酸的睡袍，露出一副古怪的表情”盯着他看，人们便告诉他是这么一回事。

勃朗宁夫人是在斯坦赫普勋爵的午宴上第一次端详水晶球的。她除了觉得那个东西的确是一个不同凡响的时代标记外，并没有看出什么来。太阳精灵明确告知她，她马上就要前往罗马了，但是她当下就反驳了太阳精灵，因为实际上她并没有马上去罗马的打算。“但是，”她如实地补充道，“我喜欢这个奇妙而神秘的东西。”她曾经花了半个钟头冒着生命危险乘马车去曼宁街，在那里发现了一个令她极其意外的世界。那么，难道就没有一个更加美好的与佛罗伦萨比邻，转眼就能到达的世界吗？在那里，生活着已经在这个世界死去的人们，他们努力地想要同我们取得联系，可所有的努力都是徒劳的。不管怎么样，勃朗宁夫人在桌子边上坐了下来，她愿意冒险一试。那位隐身人的儿子，才华出众的里顿先生来了，弗雷德里克·丁尼生先生、鲍尔斯先生和维拉里夫人也都来了。他们坐在了桌子边上，吃着草莓和奶油，品着香茗的时候，桌子腿动了。“笼罩着山峦的紫雾将整个佛罗伦萨吞没，天上星光璀璨，”他们谈论着。“……我们讲了些什么故事，并断言看见了什么样的奇迹！噢，伊莎[38]，我们都成了信徒，除了罗伯特……”就在这时候，柯卡普先生忽然走了进来，他的胡子已经白了，稀稀疏疏的，耳朵也不好使了，他之所以来这儿，只是想说：“有一个精灵的世界——一个未来的国度。我承认了。我彻底信服了！”尽管柯卡普先生的听觉不太好，可是他分明听见敲击了三下，响亮的声音“惊得他跳了起来”。他原本的信念因为这三声敲击而改变，之前他一直“差不多是个无神论者”。柯卡普先生都这样了，勃朗宁夫人自然会尝试一下的。她写道：“我这个人喜欢幻想，这你是知道的，我总是渴望能敲遍现实世界的每一道门，以便找一找，看是否有一道门能够让我走出去。”所以，在她的召集之下，吉第居来了一大批虔诚的信徒，他们围绕在桌子周围坐下，把手放在桌子上，试图找到一扇大门，好走出这个现实的世界。

这非同一般的惊吓把弗拉希给惊醒，他看到头顶上只有一条桌腿支撑着的桌子，在他的周围，裤腿和裙子在晃动着，但不论围坐在桌子旁的那些男男女女能够看到或听到什么，他什么也听不见、看不见。千真万确，桌子只有一条桌腿是着地的但所有的桌子都可以这样，只要你尽量靠在桌子的一边的话。以前他自己就把桌子弄翻过，还为此被训斥了一顿。这时候，勃朗宁夫人两只眼睛瞪得大大的，就像是看见了有什么神奇的玩意儿在外面。弗拉希飞快地跑到阳台上，环顾四周。是不是又有许多的旗帜和火把簇拥着一位大公从这儿经过？可是弗拉希什么也没看见，街道上只有一个乞丐婆子蜷缩在一篮子西瓜后面。可勃朗宁夫人肯定是看见了什么，她肯定看见了非常奇妙的东西，这样的一幕曾经在温珀尔大街的时候就发生过一次，她突然间就哭了起来，让人摸不着头脑，然而过了一会儿，她拿起一张布满墨迹的纸张，又大笑了起来。这一次跟上一次不一样，她的神情中有某种东西令弗拉希感到害怕，有什么令他十分厌恶的东西在房间里，或许是藏在桌子里，也或许藏在那些裤子和裙子中间。

时间就这样一周周过去，勃朗宁夫人越发沉迷于那种神秘的东西了。在阳光明媚、天气燥热的白天，她也只是待在桌子跟前，不愿意去看一看石头缝里爬进爬出的蜥蜴。如果勃朗宁先生不在家的话，就算是群星闪耀的夜晚，她也会把哈欠连天的威尔逊叫进来，一起坐在桌子旁，一直坐着，直到桌腿能抬起来在地板上敲出响声，而不愿去看书或者在纸上写写画画。那张桌子对于弗拉希来说，最大的功能就是给他提供了一个幽暗的栖身地。有一刻，勃朗宁夫人忽然叫喊起来，说桌子告诉她威尔逊要生病了。威尔逊说她只是犯困了而已。可是没多久，这位来自英国的严肃认真、品行端正的威尔逊就发出一声尖叫晕倒了。勃朗宁夫人火急火燎地去寻找“纯净的醋”，忙得晕头转向。在弗拉希看来，用这种不愉快的方式来打发宁静的夜晚，还不如每个人都坐下来看书好呢。

有一件事是肯定的，这种令人焦虑，无法触摸又使人生厌的气味，还有敲击声、尖叫声和醋，彻底扰乱了弗拉希的神经。帕尼尼，勃朗宁夫人的孩子，祈祷“希望弗拉希的毛重新长出来”，对于这个愿望，弗拉希认为是不错的，是可以理解的。不过弗拉希被那种既要不修边幅、散发着难闻气味的男人到场，又要牢固的红木家具捣鬼的祷告所激怒了，就像是惹恼了他那健硕、聪明而衣冠楚楚的男主人一样。除了古怪的气味和举动之外，弗拉希觉得还有更加糟糕的事情——勃朗宁夫人常用一种仿佛看到了某种神妙东西的神情凝望着窗外，可是窗外根本就什么都没有。弗拉希刻意站在她眼皮子底下，但是她的目光却似乎是穿过了他，当他完全不存在似的。那种目光是弗拉希从她身上所见过的最残酷的，就算当初弗拉希咬了勃朗宁先生的腿，她的那种叫人心惊胆战的愤怒也要比现在的这种神情好上很多；就算弗拉希在摄政公园被马车门夹住爪子时，她的那种嘲讽也要比这种神情让他觉得好受。毋庸置疑，弗拉希偶尔会想念温珀尔大街以及那儿的桌子，因为在50号大宅里，没有任何一张桌子是病歪歪地用一条腿着地的。那张镶有花边儿，上面放着勃朗宁夫人珍贵饰品的小桌子，它从来都是静悄悄地站在那里。在过去那久远的时光里，每次只要他跳上沙发，巴雷特小姐就会从睡梦中醒过来，盯着他看上一会儿。可是现在，就算他跳上沙发，她也跟没有看见他似的。就连她写作的时候，也不再瞧上他一眼。她继续写到——“这次，还是在巫师的指挥下，精灵用双手捧起桌上的一个花环，帮我戴在头上。那双手就跟人类最大的手掌一样大，雪白雪白的，好看极了。它离我非常近，之间的距离就像我现在写字的手离我的眼睛的距离一样。我看得清清楚楚。”弗拉希抬起爪子用力地抓了她一下，可她视而不见，就仿佛他隐身了一样。于是，他跳下沙发，跑下楼梯，跑到了大街上。

那个下午热浪滚滚，坐在街头的乞丐婆已经趴在西瓜上睡着了。太阳似乎激荡着空气发出嗡嗡的响声。弗拉希沿着自己所熟悉的一条街道，靠着有阴凉的一边，一路小跑着去了市场。耀目的阳光下，市场里到处都是凉棚、摊位和色彩鲜艳的遮阳伞。女摊贩们坐在装有水果的筐子旁边。成群的鸽子呼扇着翅膀，钟声不绝于耳，鞭声划破长空。各种毛色的杂种狗，在佛罗伦萨的市场里跑来跑去，凑鼻子嗅一嗅，探爪子抓一抓。市场如蜂房一般繁忙，如火炉一般火热。弗拉希为了寻找一个阴凉的地方到处溜达，最后跑到了他的朋友卡特琳娜身边，在她那只大筐子的阴凉处躺了下来。在他的旁边有一道影子，那是一只装着红色和黄色鲜花的棕色水罐投下来的。他的头顶，有一座右手直指前方的雕像，也投下来阴影，于是这一块阴影就被加深了，变成了紫色的。弗拉希躺在这片阴凉之中，看着那些吠叫、打滚儿、撕咬、伸懒腰的小狗们，看着它们尽情地玩耍，尽情地享受着年轻的快乐。它们互相追逐着，绕着圈子跑跑跳跳，就如他在巷子里追逐着那条花西班尼尔狗一样。弗拉希的思绪恍惚间又回到了雷丁——帕特里奇先生的那条西班尼尔狗，他的初恋，他想起了他那青春时代的狂喜和天真。没错，他也有过属于自己的美好过往，他无需嫉妒别人。他已经尽情享受过了生活在这个世界上所能得到的快乐，他没有什么可抱怨的。那个女摊贩在他的耳朵后面挠了挠，从前她经常用巴掌教训弗拉希，因为弗拉希总是偷吃她的葡萄，或者是干了别的什么坏事。不过现在弗拉希老了，她也上了年纪，弗拉希帮她看瓜，她帮弗拉希挠耳朵。这会儿，弗拉希犯困打盹儿的时候，她正织着毛衣。已经切开的大西瓜露出粉色的瓤儿，烦人的苍蝇围在旁边不肯离去。

阳光透过百合花的叶缝，穿过五颜六色的遮阳伞照了进来。大理石雕像将它的热度大大减弱，变得如同香槟酒一般清凉。弗拉希任凭阳光流淌进他的皮毛里，浸润进他裸露的皮肤里。他等身体的一面晒热了以后，就翻个身，让太阳烘烤另一面。市场上充斥着人们的谈话声和讨价还价声；不断有买东西的妇女从他的身边走过，她们有的停下来，伸出手去摸一摸那些瓜果蔬菜。这种哼哼嗡嗡的嘈杂人声一刻也不曾停歇，不过却正合弗拉希的意。不多久，他就躺在百合花投下的阴影里睡着了。他睡得很沉，跟狗做梦时的状态一样。他的脚爪猛地一缩——难道他梦见了自己正在西班牙追赶野兔？或者，梦见他正沿着滚烫的山坡朝山上奔跑的时候，野兔忽然从灌木丛里蹿出来，旁边有一伙皮肤黑黝黝的人呼喝着“西班！西班！”？然后他又安静地躺了一阵。又过了一会儿，他轻轻地叫了起来，急促地叫了很多声。也许，他梦见了雷丁，米特福德医生在那催促着他的狐犬追逐猎物？不多久，他又急躁地摇动起了他的尾巴，或许他梦见了老米特福德小姐正在萝卜地里挥舞着雨伞，呵斥道：“坏狗！坏狗！”他跑回到她的身边。再后来，他就打起了呼噜，沉沉地进入了幸福的晚年才会有的那种酣梦中。突然间，他身上的肌肉抽搐起来，他从梦中惊醒。他以为自己是在哪里呢？难道自己又被白教堂的那群坏蛋抓住了？刀子正抵在他的咽喉上吗？

无论他做的梦是什么样的，总之他惊恐地从梦中醒了过来。他飞奔着逃离，就好像才从死亡中挣脱一般，就好像要去找寻一个避难所一般。女摊贩们被他逗得大笑起来，叫唤他回去，并扔葡萄引诱他，可是他根本不予理会。他在大街上横冲直闯，差点被大车的轮子压到。车夫站起来，大声喝骂，拿起鞭子朝他抽来。他从一群光着膀子的孩子身边跑过，孩子们一边喊叫着“疯啦！疯啦！”一边把鹅卵石扔向他。他们的母亲们则急慌慌地跑到门口，把他们拉回去。弗拉希真的疯了吗？是被太阳给晒傻了吗？或者，维纳斯又在他的耳畔吹响了号角？抑或是他被美国的某个藏在桌腿中的敲打精灵给附身了？到底是什么原因无人知道，只知道他一个劲地奔跑，从一条街跑到另一条街，一直跑到吉第居的大门口，然后径直跑到了楼上，冲进了客厅。

他冲进去的时候，勃朗宁夫人正躺在沙发上看书，她被他吓了一跳，抬头看了一眼。原来不是精灵——只是弗拉希呀。她笑了笑。他跳到沙发上，把脑袋凑过去，去挨她的脸蛋。她忽然想起了她自己写的那段诗文：





你看这只狗。依稀还是昨日，

我沉思着，忘记了他就在这里。

直到行行眼泪，伴着绵绵愁思缓缓落下，

恍如福纳斯[39]般的毛茸茸的脸蛋

从我泪颊所枕的枕边探出

紧贴在我的脸上——两只金黄而澄澈的

大眼睛令我惊叹，——一只垂下来的耳朵

扫过我的脸颊，将我的泪水擦干。

我先是惊愕，如同一个阿卡迪亚人，

看到半羊的神出现在暮光笼罩的树林

但，当这渐渐贴近的毛绒脸蛋，擦去

我的泪水时，我才认出，原来是弗拉希啊，

超越了惊喜和悲伤——我要感谢这位真正的潘神，

借助低微的生命，将我引向爱的顶点。





这篇诗文还是当年她在温珀尔大街时写下来的，那个时候她正处于郁郁寡欢的状态中。这么多年过去了，她现在非常幸福。她老了一些，弗拉希也是。她低头看了看弗拉希，她的脸，和弗拉希的阔嘴、大眼，还有那又密又卷的毛发，依然有着惊人的相似。他们像是从一个模子里拓出来的，但是又不尽相同。或许，他们已经形成了某种互补。然而，她是一个女人，他是一条狗。勃朗宁夫人继续埋头看书。过了一会儿，她又去看弗拉希，但是这次弗拉希没有看向她。在他的身上，已经发生了一种不同寻常的变化。她唤道：“弗拉希！”可是弗拉希没有回应她。他曾经活着，但现在他死了。就是这样。令人惊奇的是，客厅里的那张桌子，依然静静地在那里立着。

The Mark on the Wall


Perhaps it was the middle of January in the present year that I first looked up and saw the mark on the wall. In order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the fire; the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it must have been the winter time, and we had just finished our tea, for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and saw the mark on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy, for it is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark was a small round mark, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece.

How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new object, lifting it a little way, as ants carry a blade of straw so feverishly, and then leave it... If that mark was made by a nail, it can't have been for a picture, it must have been for a miniature—the miniature of a lady with white powdered curls, powder-dusted cheeks, and lips like red carnations. A fraud of course, for the people who had this house before us would have chosen pictures in that way—an old picture for an old room. That is the sort of people they were—very interesting people, and I think of them so often, in such queer places, because one will never see them again, never know what happened next. They wanted to leave this house because they wanted to change their style of furniture, so he said, and he was in process of saying that in his opinion art should have ideas behind it when we were torn asunder, as one is torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes past in the train.

But as for that mark, I'm not sure about it; I don't believe it was made by a nail after all; it's too big, too round, for that. I might get up, but if I got up and looked at it, ten to one I shouldn't be able to say for certain; because once a thing's done, no one ever knows how it happened. Oh! dear me, the mystery of life; The inaccuracy of thought! The ignorance of humanity! To show how very little control of our possessions we have—what an accidental affair this living is after all our civilization—let me just count over a few of the things lost in one lifetime, beginning, for that seems always the most mysterious of losses—what cat would gnaw, what rat would nibble—three pale blue canisters of book-binding tools? Then there were the bird cages, the iron hoops, the steel skates, the Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the bagatelle board, the hand organ—all gone, and jewels, too. Opals and emeralds, they lie about the roots of turnips. What a scraping paring affair it is to be sure! The wonder is that I've any clothes on my back, that I sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one wants to compare life to anything, one must liken it to being blown through the Tube at fifty miles an hour—landing at the other end without a single hairpin in one's hair! Shot out at the feet of God entirely naked! Tumbling head over heels in the asphodel meadows like brown paper parcels pitched down a shoot in the post office! With one's hair flying back like the tail of a race-horse. Yes, that seems to express the rapidity of life, the perpetual waste and repair; all so casual, all so haphazard ...

But after life. The slow pulling down of thick green stalks so that the cup of the flower, as it turns over, deluges one with purple and red light. Why, after all, should one not be born there as one is born here, helpless, speechless, unable to focus one's eyesight, groping at the roots of the grass, at the toes of the Giants? As for saying which are trees, and which are men and women, or whether there are such things, that one won't be in a condition to do for fifty years or so. There will be nothing but spaces of light and dark, intersected by thick stalks, and rather higher up perhaps, rose-shaped blots of an indistinct colour—dim pinks and blues—which will, as time goes on, become more definite, become—I don't know what...

And yet the mark on the wall is not a hole at all. It may even be caused by some round black substance, such as a small rose leaf, left over from the summer, and I, not being a very vigilant housekeeper— look at the dust on the mantelpiece, for example, the dust which, so they say, buried Troy three times over, only fragments of pots utterly refusing annihilation, as one can believe.

The tree outside the window taps very gently on the pane ... I want to think quietly, calmly, spaciously, never to be interrupted, never to have to rise from my chair, to slip easily from one thing to another, without any sense of hostility, or obstacle. I want to sink deeper and deeper, away from the surface, with its hard separate facts. To steady myself, let me catch hold of the first idea that passes ... Shakespeare ... Well, he will do as well as another. A man who sat himself solidly in an arm-chair, and looked into the fire, so—A shower of ideas fell perpetually from some very high Heaven down through his mind. He leant his forehead on his hand, and people, looking in through the open door—for this scene is supposed to take place on a summer's evening—But how dull this is, this historical fiction! It doesn't interest me at all. I wish I could hit upon a pleasant track of thought, a track indirectly reflecting credit upon myself, for those are the pleasantest thoughts, and very frequent even in the minds of modest mouse- coloured people, who believe genuinely that they dislike to hear their own praises. They are not thoughts directly praising oneself; that is the beauty of them; they are thoughts like this:

"And then I came into the room. They were discussing botany. I said how I'd seen a flower growing on a dust heap on the site of an old house in Kingsway. The seed, I said, must have been sown in the reign of Charles the First. What flowers grew in the reign of Charles the First?" I asked—(but, I don't remember the answer). Tall flowers with purple tassels to them perhaps. And so it goes on. All the time I'm dressing up the figure of myself in my own mind, lovingly, stealthily, not openly adoring it, for if I did that, I should catch myself out, and stretch my hand at once for a book in self-protection. Indeed, it is curious how instinctively one protects the image of oneself from idolatry or any other handling that could make it ridiculous, or too unlike the original to be believed in any longer. Or is it not so very curious after all? It is a matter of great importance. Suppose the looking glass smashes, the image disappears, and the romantic figure with the green of forest depths all about it is there no longer, but only that shell of a person which is seen by other people—what an airless, shallow, bald, prominent world it becomes! A world not to be lived in. As we face each other in omnibuses and underground railways we are looking into the mirror; that accounts for the vagueness, the gleam of glassiness, in our eyes. And the novelists in future will realize more and more the importance of these reflections, for of course there is not one reflection but an almost infinite number; those are the depths they will explore, those the phantoms they will pursue, leaving the description of reality more and more out of their stories, taking a knowledge of it for granted, as the Greeks did and Shakespeare perhaps—but these generalizations are very worthless. The military sound of the word is enough. It recalls leading articles, cabinet ministers—a whole class of things indeed which as a child one thought the thing itself, the standard thing, the real thing, from which one could not depart save at the risk of nameless damnation. Generalizations bring back somehow Sunday in London, Sunday afternoon walks, Sunday luncheons, and also ways of speaking of the dead, clothes, and habits—like the habit of sitting all together in one room until a certain hour, although nobody liked it. There was a rule for everything. The rule for tablecloths at that particular period was that they should be made of tapestry with little yellow compartments marked upon them, such as you may see in photographs of the carpets in the corridors of the royal palaces. Tablecloths of a different kind were not real tablecloths. How shocking, and yet how wonderful it was to discover that these real things, Sunday luncheons, Sunday walks, country houses, and tablecloths were not entirely real, were indeed half phantoms, and the damnation which visited the disbeliever in them was only a sense of illegitimate freedom. What now takes the place of those things I wonder, those real standard things? Men perhaps, should you be a woman; the masculine point of view which governs our lives, which sets the standard, which establishes Whitaker's Table of Precedency, which has become, I suppose, since the war half a phantom to many men and women, which soon, one may hope, will be laughed into the dustbin where the phantoms go, the mahogany sideboards and the Landseer prints, Gods and Devils, Hell and so forth, leaving us all with an intoxicating sense of illegitimate freedom—if freedom exists ...

In certain lights that mark on the wall seems actually to project from the wall. Nor is it entirely circular. I cannot be sure, but it seems to cast a perceptible shadow, suggesting that if I ran my finger down that strip of the wall it would, at a certain point, mount and descend a small tumulus, a smooth tumulus like those barrows on the South Downs which are, they say, either tombs or camps. Of the two I should prefer them to be tombs, desiring melancholy like most English people, and finding it natural at the end of a walk to think of the bones stretched beneath the turf... There must be some book about it. Some antiquary must have dug up those bones and given them a name ... What sort of a man is an antiquary, I wonder? Retired Colonels for the most part, I daresay, leading parties of aged labourers to the top here, examining clods of earth and stone, and getting into correspondence with the neighbouring clergy, which, being opened at breakfast time, gives them a feeling of importance, and the comparison of arrow-heads necessitates cross-country journeys to the county towns, an agreeable necessity both to them and to their elderly wives, who wish to make plum jam or to clean out the study, and have every reason for keeping that great question of the camp or the tomb in perpetual suspension, while the Colonel himself feels agreeably philosophic in accumulating evidence on both sides of the question. It is true that he does finally incline to believe in the camp; and, being opposed, indites a pamphlet which he is about to read at the quarterly meeting of the local society when a stroke lays him low, and his last conscious thoughts are not of wife or child, but of the camp and that arrowhead there, which is now in the case at the local museum, together with the foot of a Chinese murderess, a handful of Elizabethan nails, a great many Tudor clay pipes, a piece of Roman pottery, and the wine-glass that Nelson drank out of—proving I really don't know what.

No, no, nothing is proved, nothing is known. And if I were to get up at this very moment and ascertain that the mark on the wall is really—what shall we say?—the head of a gigantic old nail, driven in two hundred years ago, which has now, owing to the patient attrition of many generations of housemaids, revealed its head above the coat of paint, and is taking its first view of modern life in the sight of a white-walled fire-lit room, what should I gain? Knowledge? Matter for further speculation? I can think sitting still as well as standing up. And what is knowledge? What are our learned men save the descendants of witches and hermits who crouched in caves and in woods brewing herbs, interrogating shrew-mice and writing down the language of the stars? And the less we honour them as our superstitions dwindle and our respect for beauty and health of mind increases ... Yes, one could imagine a very pleasant world. A quiet, spacious world, with the flowers so red and blue in the open fields. A world without professors or specialists or house-keepers with the profiles of policemen, a world which one could slice with one's thought as a fish slices the water with his fin, grazing the stems of the water-lilies, hanging suspended over nests of white sea eggs ... How peaceful it is drown here, rooted in the centre of the world and gazing up through the grey waters, with their sudden gleams of light, and their reflections—if it were not for Whitaker's Almanack—if it were not for the Table of Precedency!

I must jump up and see for myself what that mark on the wall really is—a nail, a rose-leaf, a crack in the wood?

Here is nature once more at her old game of self-preservation. This train of thought, she perceives, is threatening mere waste of energy, even some collision with reality, for who will ever be able to lift a finger against Whitaker's Table of Precedency? The Archbishop of Canterbury is followed by the Lord High Chancellor; the Lord High Chancellor is followed by the Archbishop of York. Everybody follows somebody, such is the philosophy of Whitaker; and the great thing is to know who follows whom. Whitaker knows, and let that, so Nature counsels, comfort you, instead of enraging you; and if you can't be comforted, if you must shatter this hour of peace, think of the mark on the wall.

I understand Nature's game—her prompting to take action as a way of ending any thought that threatens to excite or to pain. Hence, I suppose, comes our slight contempt for men of action—men, we assume, who don't think. Still, there's no harm in putting a full stop to one's disagreeable thoughts by looking at a mark on the wall.

Indeed, now that I have fixed my eyes upon it, I feel that I have grasped a plank in the sea; I feel a satisfying sense of reality which at once turns the two Archbishops and the Lord High Chancellor to the shadows of shades. Here is something definite, something real. Thus, waking from a midnight dream of horror, one hastily turns on the light and lies quiescent, worshipping the chest of drawers, worshipping solidity, worshipping reality, worshipping the impersonal world which is a proof of some existence other than ours. That is what one wants to be sure of... Wood is a pleasant thing to think about. It comes from a tree; and trees grow, and we don't know how they grow. For years and years they grow, without paying any attention to us, in meadows, in forests, and by the side of rivers—all things one likes to think about. The cows swish their tails beneath them on hot afternoons; they paint rivers so green that when a moorhen dives one expects to see its feathers all green when it comes up again. I like to think of the fish balanced against the stream like flags blown out; and of water- beetles slowly raiding domes of mud upon the bed of the river. I like to think of the tree itself : first the close dry sensation of being wood; then the grinding of the storm; then the slow, delicious ooze of sap. I like to think of it, too, on winter's nights standing in the empty field with all leaves close-furled, nothing tender exposed to the iron bullets of the moon, a naked mast upon an earth that goes tumbling, tumbling, all night long. The song of birds must sound very loud and strange in June; and how cold the feet of insects must feel upon it, as they make laborious progresses up the creases of the bark, or sun themselves upon the thin green awning of the leaves, and look straight in front of them with diamond-cut red eyes ... One by one the fibres snap beneath the immense cold pressure of the earth, then the last storm comes and, falling, the highest branches drive deep into the ground again. Even so, life isn't done with; there are a million patient, watchful lives still for a tree, all over the world, in bedrooms, in ships, on the pavement, lining rooms, where men and women sit after tea, smoking cigarettes. It is full of peaceful thoughts, happy thoughts, this tree. I should like to take each one separately—but something is getting in the way ... Where was I? What has it all been about? A tree? A river? The Downs? Whitaker's Almanack? The fields of asphodel? I can't remember a thing. Everything's moving, falling, slipping, vanishing ... There is a vast upheaval of matter. Someone is standing over me and saying—

"I'm going out to buy a newspaper."

"Yes?"

"Though it's no good buying newspapers ... Nothing ever happens. Curse this war; God damn this war! ... All the same, I don't see why we should have a snail on our wall."

Ah, the mark on the wall! It was a snail.





Three Pictures


The First Picture


It is impossible that one should not see pictures; because if my father was a blacksmith and yours was a peer of the realm, we must needs be pictures to each other. We cannot possibly break out of the frame of the picture by speaking natural words. You see me leaning against the door of the smithy with a horseshoe in my hand and you think as you go by: "How picturesque!" I, seeing you sitting so much at your ease in the car, almost as if you were going to bow to the populace, think what a picture of old luxurious aristocratical England! We are both quite wrong in our judgments no doubt, but that is inevitable.

So now at the turn of the road I saw one of these pictures. It might have been called "The Sailor's Homecoming" or some such title. A fine young sailor carrying a bundle; a girl with her hand on his arm; neighbours gathering round; a cottage garden ablaze with flowers; as one passed one read at the bottom of that picture that the sailor was back from China, and there was a fine spread waiting for him in the parlour; and he had a present for his young wife in his bundle; and she was soon going to bear him their first child. Everything was right and good and as it should be, one felt about that picture. There was something wholesome and satisfactory in the sight of such happiness; life seemed sweeter and more enviable than before.

So thinking I passed them, filling in the picture as fully, as completely as I could, noticing the colour of her dress, of his eyes, seeing the sandy cat slinking round the cottage door.

For some time the picture floated in my eyes, making most things appear much brighter, warmer, and simpler than usual; and making some things appear foolish; and some things wrong and some things right, and more full of meaning than before. At odd moments during that day and the next the picture returned to one's mind, and one thought with envy, but with kindness, of the happy sailor and his wife; one wondered what they were doing, what they were saying now. The imagination supplied other pictures springing from that first one, a picture of the sailor cutting firewood, drawing water; and they talked about China; and the girl set his present on the chimneypiece where everyone who came could see it; and she sewed at her baby clothes, and all the doors and windows were open into the garden so that the birds were flittering and the bees humming, and Rogers—that was his name—could not say how much to his liking all this was after the China seas. As he smoked his pipe, with his foot in the garden.





The Second Picture


In the middle of the night a loud cry rang through the village. Then there was a sound of something scuffling; and then dead silence. All that could be seen out of the window was the branch of lilac tree hanging motionless and ponderous across the road. It was a hot still night. There was no moon. The cry made everything seem ominous. Who had cried? Why had she cried? It was a woman's voice, made by some extremity of feeling almost sexless, almost expressionless. It was as if human nature had cried out against some iniquity, some inexpressible horror. There was dead silence. The stars shone perfectly steadily. The fields lay still. The trees were motionless. Yet all seemed guilty, convicted, ominous. One felt that something ought to be done. Some light ought to appear tossing, moving agitatedly. Someone ought to come running down the road. There should be lights in the cottage windows. And then perhaps another cry, but less sexless, less wordless, comforted, appeased. But no light came. No feet were heard. There was no second cry. The first had been swallowed up, and there was dead silence.

One lay in the dark listening intently. It had been merely a voice. There was nothing to connect it with. No picture of any sort came to interpret it, to make it intelligible to the mind. But as the dark arose at last all one saw was an obscure human form, almost without shape, raising a gigantic arm in vain against some overwhelming iniquity.





The Third Picture


The fine weather remained unbroken. Had it not been for that single cry in the night one would have felt that the earth had put into harbour; that life had ceased to drive before the wind; that it had reached some quiet cove and there lay anchored, hardly moving, on the quiet waters. But the sound persisted. Wherever one went, it might be for a long walk up into the hills, something seemed to turn uneasily beneath the surface, making the peace, the stability all round one seem a little unreal. There were the sheep clustered on the side of the hill; the valley broke in long tapering waves like the fall of smooth waters. One came on solitary farmhouses. The puppy rolled in the yard. The butterflies gambolled over the gorse. All was as quiet, as safe [as] could be. Yet, one kept thinking, a cry had rent it; all this beauty had been an accomplice that night; had consented to remain calm, to be still beautiful; at any moment it might be sundered again. This goodness, this safety were only on the surface.

And then to cheer oneself out of this apprehensive mood one turned to the picture of the sailor's homecoming. One saw it all over again producing various little details—the blue colour of her dress, the shadow that fell from the yellow flowering tree—that one had not used before. So they had stood at the cottage door, he with his bundle on his back, she just lightly touching his sleeve with her hand. And a sandy cat had slunk round the door. Thus gradually going over the picture in every detail, one persuaded oneself by degrees that it was far more likely that this calm and content and good will lay beneath the surface than anything treacherous, sinister. The sheep grazing, the waves of the valley, the farmhouse, the puppy, the dancing butterflies were in fact like that all through. And so one turned back home, with one's mind fixed on the sailor and his wife, making up picture after picture of them so that one picture after another of happiness and satisfaction might be laid over that unrest, that hideous cry, until it was crushed and silenced by their pressure out of existence.

Here at last was the village, and the churchyard through which one must pass; and the usual thought came, as one entered it, of the peacefulness of the place, with its shady yews, its rubbed tombstones, its nameless graves. Death is cheerful here, one felt. Indeed, look at that picture! A man was digging a grave, and children were picnicking at the side of it while he worked. As the shovels of yellow earth were thrown up, the children were sprawling about eating bread and jam and drinking milk out of large mugs. The gravedigger's wife, a fat fair woman, had propped herself against a tombstone and spread her apron on the grass by the open grave to serve as a tea-table. Some lumps of clay had fallen among the tea things. Who was going to be buried, I asked. Had old Mr. Dodson died at last? "Oh! no. It's for young Rogers, the sailor," the woman answered, staring at me. "He died two nights ago, of some foreign fever. Didn't you hear his wife? She rushed into the road and cried out... . Here, Tommy, you're all covered with earth!"

What a picture it made!

Mabel had her first serious suspicion that something was wrong as she took her cloak off and Mrs. Barnet, while handing her the mirror and touching the brushes and thus drawing her attention, perhaps rather markedly, to all the appliances for tidying and improving hair, complexion, clothes, which existed on the dressing table, confirmed the suspicion—that it was not right, not quite right, which growing stronger as she went upstairs and springing at her, with conviction as she greeted Clarissa Dalloway, she went straight to the far end of the room, to a shaded corner where a looking-glass hung and looked. No! It was not right. And at once the misery which she always tried to hide, the profound dissatisfaction—the sense she had had, ever since she was a child, of being inferior to other people—set upon her, relentlessly, remorselessly, with an intensity which she could not beat off, as she would when she woke at night at home, by reading Borrow or Scott; for oh these men, oh these women, all were thinking— "What's Mabel wearing? What a fright she looks! What a hideous new dress!"—their eyelids flickering as they came up and then their lids shutting rather tight. It was her own appalling inadequacy; her cowardice; her mean, water-sprinkled blood that depressed her. And at once the whole of the room where, for ever so many hours, she had planned with the little dressmaker how it was to go, seemed sordid, repulsive; and her own drawing-room so shabby, and herself, going out, puffed up with vanity as she touched the letters on the hall table and said: "How dull!" to show off—all this now seemed unutterably silly, paltry, and provincial. All this had been absolutely destroyed, shown up, exploded, the moment she came into Mrs. Dalloway's drawing-room.

What she had thought that evening when, sitting over the teacups, Mrs. Dalloway's invitation came, was that, of course, she could not be fashionable. It was absurd to pretend it even—fashion meant cut, meant style, meant thirty guineas at least—but why not be original? Why not be herself, anyhow? And, getting up, she had taken that old fashion book of her mother's, a Paris fashion book of the time of the Empire, and had thought how much prettier, more dignified, and more womanly they were then, and so set herself—oh, it was foolish— trying to be like them, pluming herself in fact, upon being modest and old-fashioned, and very charming, giving herself up, no doubt about it, to an orgy of self-love, which deserved to be chastised, and so rigged herself out like this.

But she dared not look in the glass. She could not face the whole horror—the pale yellow, idiotically old-fashioned silk dress with its long skirt and its high sleeves and its waist and all the things that looked so charming in the fashion book, but not on her, not among all these ordinary people. She felt like a dressmaker's dummy standing there, for young people to stick pins into.

"But, my dear, it's perfectly charming!" Rose Shaw said, looking her up and down with that little satirical pucker of the lips which she expected—Rose herself being dressed in the height of the fashion, precisely like everybody else, always.

We are all like flies trying to crawl over the edge of the saucer, Mabel thought, and repeated the phrase as if she were crossing herself, as if she were trying to find some spell to annul this pain, to make this agony endurable. Tags of Shakespeare, lines from books she had read ages ago, suddenly came to her when she was in agony, and she repeated them over and over again. "Flies trying to crawl," she repeated. If she could say that over often enough and make herself see the flies, she would become numb, chill, frozen, dumb. Now she could see flies crawling slowly out of a saucer of milk with their wings stuck together; and she strained and strained (standing in front of the looking-glass, listening to Rose Shaw) to make herself see Rose Shaw and all the other people there as flies, trying to hoist themselves out of something, or into something, meagre, insignificant, toiling flies. But she could not see them like that, not other people. She saw herself like that—she was a fly, but the others were dragon-flies, butterflies, beautiful insects, dancing, fluttering, skimming, while she alone dragged herself up out of the saucer. (Envy and spite, the most detestable of the vices, were her chief faults.)

"I feel like some dowdy, decrepit, horribly dingy old fly," she said, making Robert Haydon stop just to hear her say that, just to reassure herself by furbishing up a poor weak-kneed phrase and so showing how detached she was, how witty, that she did not feel in the least out of anything. And, of course, Robert Haydon answered something quite polite, quite insincere, which she saw through instantly, and said to herself, directly he went (again from some book), "Lies, lies, lies!" For a party makes things either much more real, or much less real, she thought; she saw in a flash to the bottom of Robert Haydon's heart; she saw through everything. She saw the truth. This was true, this drawing-room, this self, and the other false. Miss Milan's little workroom was really terribly hot, stuffy, sordid. It smelt of clothes and cabbage cooking; and yet when Miss Milan put the glass in her hand, and she looked at herself with the dress on, finished, an extraordinary bliss shot through her heart. Suffused with light, she sprang into existence. Rid of cares and wrinkles, what she had dreamed of herself was there—a beautiful woman. Just for a second (she had not dared look longer, Miss Milan wanted to know about the length of the skirt), there looked at her, framed in the scrolloping mahogany, a grey-white, mysteriously smiling, charming girl, the core of herself, the soul of herself; and it was not vanity only, not only self-love that made her think it good, tender, and true. Miss Milan said that the skirt could not well be longer; if anything the skirt, said Miss Milan, puckering her forehead, considering with all her wits about her, must be shorter; and she felt, suddenly, honestly, full of love for Miss Milan, much, much fonder of Miss Milan than of any one in the whole world, and could have cried for pity that she should be crawling on the floor with her mouth full of pins, and her face red and her eyes bulging—that one human being should be doing this for another, and she saw them all as human beings merely, and herself going off to her party, and Miss Milan pulling the cover over the canary's cage, or letting him pick a hempseed from between her lips, and the thought of it, of this side of human nature and its patience and its endurance and its being content with such miserable, scanty, sordid, little pleasures filled her eyes with tears.

And now the whole thing had vanished. The dress, the room, the love, the pity, the scrolloping looking-glass, and the canary's cage— all had vanished, and here she was in a corner of Mrs. Dalloway's drawing-room, suffering tortures, woken wide awake to reality.

But it was all so paltry, weak-blooded, and petty-minded to care so much at her age with two children, to be still so utterly dependent on people's opinions and not have principles or convictions, not to be able to say as other people did, "There's Shakespeare! There's death! We're all weevils in a captain's biscuit"—or whatever it was that people did say.

She faced herself straight in the glass; she pecked at her left shoulder; she issued out into the room, as if spears were thrown at her yellow dress from all sides. But instead of looking fierce or tragic, as Rose Shaw would have done—Rose would have looked like Boadicea—she looked foolish and self-conscious, and simpered like a schoolgirl and slouched across the room, positively slinking, as if she were a beaten mongrel, and looked at a picture, an engraving. As if one went to a party to look at a picture! Everybody knew why she did it—it was from shame, from humiliation.

"Now the fly's in the saucer," she said to herself, "right in the middle, and can't get out, and the milk," she thought, rigidly staring at the picture, "is sticking its wings together."

"It's so old-fashioned," she said to Charles Burt, making him stop (which by itself he hated) on his way to talk to some one else.

She meant, or she tried to make herself think that she meant, that it was the picture and not her dress, that was old-fashioned. And one word of praise, one word of affection from Charles would have made all the difference to her at the moment. If he had only said, "Mabel, you're looking charming to-night!" it would have changed her life. But then she ought to have been truthful and direct. Charles said nothing of the kind, of course. He was malice itself. He always saw through one, especially if one were feeling particularly mean, paltry, or feebleminded.

"Mabel's got a new dress!" he said, and the poor fly was absolutely shoved into the middle of the saucer. Really, he would like her to drown, she believed. He had no heart, no fundamental kindness, only a veneer of friendliness. Miss Milan was much more real, much kinder. If only one could feel that and stick to it, always. "Why," she asked herself—replying to Charles much too pertly, letting him see that she was out of temper, or "ruffled" as he called it ("Rather ruffled?" he said and went on to laugh at her with some woman over there)—"Why," she asked herself, "can't I feel one thing always, feel quite sure that Miss Milan is right, and Charles wrong and stick to it, feel sure about the canary and pity and love and not be whipped all round in a second by coming into a room full of people?" It was her odious, weak, vacillating character again, always giving at the critical moment and not being seriously interested in conchology, etymology, botany, archeology, cutting up potatoes and watching them fructify like Mary Dennis, like Violet Searle.

Then Mrs. Holman, seeing her standing there, bore down upon her. Of course a thing like a dress was beneath Mrs. Holman's notice, with her family always tumbling downstairs or having the scarlet fever. Could Mabel tell her if Elmthorpe was ever let for August and September? Oh, it was a conversation that bored her unutterably!—it made her furious to be treated like a house agent or a messenger boy, to be made use of. Not to have value, that was it, she thought, trying to grasp something hard, something real, while she tried to answer sensibly about the bathroom and the south aspect and the hot water to the top of the house; and all the time she could see little bits of her yellow dress in the round looking-glass which made them all the size of boot-buttons or tadpoles; and it was amazing to think how much humiliation and agony and self-loathing and effort and passionate ups and downs of feeling were contained in a thing the size of a three penny bit. And what was still odder, this thing, this Mabel Waring, was separate, quite disconnected; and though Mrs. Holman (the black button) was leaning forward and telling her how her eldest boy had strained his heart running, she could see her, too, quite detached in the looking-glass, and it was impossible that the black dot, leaning forward, gesticulating, should make the yellow dot, sitting solitary, self-centred, feel what the black dot was feeling, yet they pretended.

"So impossible to keep boys quiet"—that was the kind of thing one said.

And Mrs. Holman, who could never get enough sympathy and snatched what little there was greedily, as if it were her right (but she deserved much more for there was her little girl who had come down this morning with a swollen knee-joint), took this miserable offering and looked at it suspiciously, grudgingly, as if it were a halfpenny when it ought to have been a pound and put it away in her purse, must put up with it, mean and miserly though it was, times being hard, so very hard; and on she went, creaking, injured Mrs. Holman, about the girl with the swollen joints. Ah, it was tragic, this greed, this clamour of human beings, like a row of cormorants, barking and flapping their wings for sympathy—it was tragic, could one have felt it and not merely pretended to feel it!

But in her yellow dress to-night she could not wring out one drop more; she wanted it all, all for herself. She knew (she kept on looking into the glass, dipping into that dreadfully showing-up blue pool) that she was condemned, despised, left like this in a backwater, because of her being like this a feeble, vacillating creature; and it seemed to her that the yellow dress was a penance which she had deserved, and if she had been dressed like Rose Shaw, in lovely, clinging green with a ruffle of swansdown, she would have deserved that; and she thought that there was no escape for her—none whatever. But it was not her fault altogether, after all. It was being one of a family of ten; never having money enough, always skimping and paring; and her mother carrying great cans, and the linoleum worn on the stair edges, and one sordid little domestic tragedy after another—nothing catastrophic, the sheep farm failing, but not utterly; her eldest brother marrying beneath him but not very much—there was no romance, nothing extreme about them all. They petered out respectably in seaside resorts; every watering-place had one of her aunts even now asleep in some lodging with the front windows not quite facing the sea. That was so like them—they had to squint at things always. And she had done the same—she was just like her aunts. For all her dreams of living in India, married to some hero like Sir Henry Lawrence, some empire builder (still the sight of a native in a turban filled her with romance), she had failed utterly. She had married Hubert, with his safe, permanent underling's job in the Law Courts, and they managed tolerably in a smallish house, without proper maids, and hash when she was alone or just bread and butter, but now and then—Mrs. Holman was off, thinking her the most dried-up, unsympathetic twig she had ever met, absurdly dressed, too, and would tell every one about Mabel's fantastic appearance—now and then, thought Mabel Waring, left alone on the blue sofa, punching the cushion in order to look occupied, for she would not join Charles Burt and Rose Shaw, chattering like magpies and perhaps laughing at her by the fireplace— now and then, there did come to her delicious moments, reading the other night in bed, for instance, or down by the sea on the sand in the sun, at Easter—let her recall it—a great tuft of pale sand-grass standing all twisted like a shock of spears against the sky, which was blue like a smooth china egg, so firm, so hard, and then the melody of the waves—"Hush, hush," they said, and the children's shouts paddling—yes, it was a divine moment, and there she lay, she felt, in the hand of the Goddess who was the world; rather a hard-hearted, but very beautiful Goddess, a little lamb laid on the altar (one did think these silly things and it didn't matter so long as one never said them). And also with Hubert sometimes she had quite unexpectedly—carving the mutton for Sunday lunch, for no reason, opening a letter, coming into a room—divine moments, when she said to herself (for she would never say this to anybody else), "This is it. This has happened. This is it!" And the other way about it was equally surprising—that is, when everything was arranged—music, weather, holidays, every reason for happiness was there—then nothing happened at all. One wasn't happy. It was flat, just flat, that was all.

Her wretched self again, no doubt! She had always been a fretful, weak, unsatisfactory mother, a wobbly wife, lolling about in a kind of twilight existence with nothing very clear or very bold or more one thing than another, like all her brothers and sisters, except perhaps Herbert—they were all the same poor water-veined creatures who did nothing. Then in the midst of this creeping, crawling life, suddenly she was on the crest of a wave. That wretched fly—where had she read the story that kept coming into her mind about the fly and the saucer?— struggled out. Yes, she had those moments. But now that she was forty, they might come more and more seldom. By degrees she would cease to struggle any more. But that was deplorable! That was not to be endured! That made her feel ashamed of herself!

She would go to the London Library to-morrow. She would find some wonderful, helpful, astonishing book, quite by chance, a book by a clergyman, by an American no one had ever heard of; or she would walk down the Strand and drop, accidentally, into a hall where a miner was telling about the life in the pit and suddenly she would become a new person. She would be absolutely transformed. She would wear a uniform; she would be called Sister Somebody; she would never give a thought to clothes again. And for ever after she would be perfectly clear about Charles Burt and Miss Milan and this room and that room; and it would be always, day after day, as if she were lying in the sun or carving the mutton. It would be it!

So she got up from the blue sofa, and the yellow button in the looking-glass got up too, and she waved her hand to Charles and Rose to show them she did not depend on them one scrap, and the yellow button moved out of the looking-glass, and all the spears were gathered into her breast as she walked towards Mrs. Dalloway and said "Good night."

"But it's top early to go," said Mrs. Dalloway, who was always so charming.

"I'm afraid I must," said Mabel Waring. "But," she added in her weak, wobbly voice which only sounded ridiculous when she tried to strengthen it, "I have enjoyed myself enormously."

'I have enjoyed myself," she said to Mr. Dalloway, whom she met on the stairs.

"Lies, lies, lies!" she said to herself, going downstairs, and "Right in the saucer!" she said to herself as she thanked Mrs. Barnet for helping her and wrapped herself, round and round and round, in the Chinese cloak she had worn these twenty years.





The Man Who Loved His Kind


Trotting through Deans Yard that afternoon, Prickett Ellis ran straight into Richard Dalloway, or rather, just as they were passing the covert side glance which each was casting on the other, under his hat, over his shoulder, broadened and burst into recognition; they had not met for twenty years. They had been at school together. And what was Ellis doing? The Bar? Of course, of course—he had followed the case in the papers. But it was impossible to talk here. Wouldn't he drop in that evening. (They lived in the same old place—just round the corner.) One or two people were coming. Joynson perhaps. "An awful swell now," said Richard.

"Good—till this evening then," said Richard, and went his way, "jolly glad" (that was quite true) to have met that queer chap, who hadn't changed one bit since he had been at school—just the same knobbly, chubby little boy then, with prejudices sticking out all over him, but uncommonly brilliant—won the Newcastle. Well—off he went.

Prickett Ellis, however, as he turned and looked at Dalloway disappearing, wished now he had not met him or, at least, for he had always liked him personally, hadn't promised to come to this party. Dalloway was married, gave parties; wasn't his sort at all. He would have to dress. However, as the evening drew on, he supposed, as he had said that, and didn't want to be rude, he must go there.

But what an appalling entertainment! There was Joynson; they had nothing to say to each other. He had been a pompous little boy; he had grown rather more self-important—that was all; there wasn't a single other soul in the room that Prickett Ellis knew. Not one. So, as he could not go at once, without saying a word to Dalloway, who seemed altogether taken up with his duties, bustling about in a white waistcoat, there he had to stand. It was the sort of thing that made his gorge rise. Think of grown up, responsible men and women doing this every night of their lives! The lines deepened on his blue and red shaven cheeks, as he leant against the wall, in complete silence; for though he worked like a horse, he kept himself fit by exercise; and he looked hard and fierce, as if his moustaches were dipped in frost. He bristled; he grated. His meagre dress clothes made him look unkempt, insignificant, angular.

Idle, chattering, overdressed, without an idea in their heads, these fine ladies and gentlemen went on talking and laughing; and Prickett Ellis watched them and compared them with the Brunners who, when they won their case against Fenners' Brewery and got two hundred pounds compensation (it was not half what they should have got) went and spent five of it on a clock for him. That was a decent sort of thing to do; that was the sort of thing that moved one, and he glared more severely than ever at these people, overdressed, cynical, prosperous, and compared what he felt now with what he felt at eleven o'clock that morning when old Brunner and Mrs. Brunner in their best clothes, awfully respectable and clean looking old people, had called in to give him that small token, as the old man put it, standing perfectly upright to make his speech of gratitude and respect for the very able way in which you conducted our case, and Mrs. Brunner piped up, how it was all due to him they felt. And they deeply appreciated his generosity— because of course he hadn't taken a fee.

And as he took the clock and put it on the middle of his mantelpiece, he had felt that he wished nobody to see his face. That was what he worked for—that was his reward; and he looked at the people who were actually before his eyes as if they danced over that scene in his chambers and were exposed by it, and as it faded—the Brunners faded—there remained as if left of that scene, himself, confronting this hostile population, a perfectly plain unsophisticated man, a man of the people (he straightened himself) very badly dressed, glaring, with not an air or a grace about him, a man who was an ill hand at concealing his feelings, a plain man, an ordinary human being, pitted against the evil, the corruption, the heartlessness of society. But he would not go on staring. Now he put on his spectacles and examined the pictures. He read the titles on a line of books; for the most part poetry. He would have liked well enough to read some of his old favourites again—Shakespeare, Dickens—he wished he ever had time to turn into the National Gallery, but he couldn't—no, one could not. Really one could not—with the world in the state it was in. Not when people all day long wanted your help, fairly clamoured for help. This wasn't an age for luxuries. And he looked at the arm chairs and the paper knives and the well bound books, and shook his head, knowing that he would never have the time, never he was glad to think have the heart, to afford himself such luxuries. The people here would be shocked if they knew what he paid for his tobacco; how he had borrowed his clothes. His one and only extravagance was his little yacht on the Norfolk Broads. And that he did allow himself. He did like once a year to get right away from everybody and lie on his back in a field. He thought how shocked they would be—these fine folk—if they realized the amount of pleasure he got from what he was old fashioned enough to call the love of nature; trees and fields he had known ever since he was a boy.

These fine people would be shocked. Indeed, standing there, putting his spectacles away in his pocket, he felt himself grow more and more shocking every instant. And it was a very disagreeable feeling. He did not feel this—that he loved humanity, that he paid only five pence an ounce for tobacco and loved nature—naturally and quietly. Each of these pleasures had been turned into a protest. He felt that these people whom he despised made him stand and deliver and justify himself. "I am an ordinary man," he kept saying. And what he said next he was really ashamed of saying, but he said it. "I have done more for my kind in one day than the rest of you in all your lives." Indeed, he could not help himself; he kept recalling scene after scene, like that when the Brunners gave him the clock—he kept reminding himself of the nice things people had said of his humanity, of his generosity, how he had helped them. He kept seeing himself as the wise and tolerant servant of humanity. And he wished he could repeat his praises aloud. It was unpleasant that the sense of his goodness should boil within him. It was still more unpleasant that he could tell no one what people had said about him. Thank the Lord, he kept saying, I shall be back at work to-morrow; and yet he was no longer satisfied simply to slip through the door and go home. He must stay, he must stay until he had justified himself. But how could he? In all that room full of people, he did not know a soul to speak to.

At last Richard Dalloway came up.

"I want to introduce Miss O'Keefe," he said. Miss O'Keefe looked him full in the eyes. She was a rather arrogant, abrupt mannered woman in the thirties.

Miss O'Keefe wanted an ice or something to drink. And the reason why she asked Prickett Ellis to give it her in what he felt a haughty, unjustifiable manner, was that she had seen a woman and two children, very poor, very tired, pressing against the railings of a square, peering in, that hot afternoon. Can't they be let in? she had thought, her pity rising like a wave; her indignation boiling. No; she rebuked herself the next moment, roughly, as if she boxed her own ears. The whole force of the world can't do it. So she picked up the tennis ball and hurled it back. The whole force of the world can't do it, she said in a fury, and that was why she said so commandingly, to the unknown man:

"Give me an ice."

Long before she had eaten it, Prickett Ellis, standing beside her without taking anything, told her that he had not been to a party for fifteen years; told her that his dress suit was lent him by his brother- in-law; told her that he did not like this sort of thing, and it would have eased him greatly to go on to say that he was a plain man, who happened to have a liking for ordinary people, and then would have told her (and been ashamed of it afterwards) about the Brunners and the clock, but she said:

"Have you seen the Tempest?"

then (for he had not seen the Tempest), had he read some book? Again no, and then, putting her ice down, did he never read poetry?

And Prickett Ellis feeling something rise within him which would decapitate this young woman, make a victim of her, massacre her, made her sit down there, where they would not be interrupted, on two chairs, in the empty garden, for everyone was upstairs, only you could hear a buzz and a hum and a chatter and a jingle, like the mad accompaniment of some phantom orchestra to a cat or two slinking across the grass, and the wavering of leaves, and the yellow and red fruit like Chinese lanterns wobbling this way and that—the talk seemed like a frantic skeleton dance music set to something very real, and full of suffering.

"How beautiful!" said Miss O'Keefe.

Oh, it was beautiful, this little patch of grass, with the towers of Westminster massed round it black high in the air, after the drawingroom; it was silent, after that noise. After all, they had that—the tired woman, the children.

Prickett Ellis lit a pipe. That would shock her; he filled it with shag tobacco—five pence halfpenny an ounce. He thought how he would lie in his boat smoking, he could see himself, alone, at night, smoking under the stars. For always to-night he kept thinking how he would look if these people here were to see him. He said to Miss O'Keefe, striking a match on the sole of his boot, that he couldn't see anything particularly beautiful out here.

"Perhaps," said Miss O'Keefe, "you don't care for beauty." (He had told her that he had not seen the Tempest; that he had not read a book; he looked ill-kempt, all moustache, chin, and silver watch chain.) She thought nobody need pay a penny for this; the Museums are free and the National Gallery; and the country. Of course she knew the objections—the washing, cooking, children; but the root of things, what they were all afraid of saying, was that happiness is dirt cheap. You can have it for nothing. Beauty.

Then Prickett Ellis let her have it—this pale, abrupt, arrogant woman. He told her, puffing his shag tobacco, what he had done that day. Up at six; interviews; smelling a drain in a filthy slum; then to court.

Here he hesitated, wishing to tell her something of his own doings. Suppressing that, he was all the more caustic. He said it made him sick to hear well fed, well dressed women (she twitched her lips, for she was thin, and her dress not up to standard) talk of beauty.

"Beauty!" he said. He was afraid he did not understand beauty apart from human beings.

So they glared into the empty garden where the lights were swaying, and one cat hesitating in the middle, its paw lifted.

Beauty apart from human beings? What did he mean by that? she demanded suddenly.

Well this: getting more and more wrought up, he told her the story of the Brunners and the clock, not concealing his pride in it. That was beautiful, he said.

She had no words to specify the horror his story roused in her. First his conceit; then his indecency in talking about human feelings; it was a blasphemy; no one in the whole world ought to tell a story to prove that they had loved their kind. Yet as he told it—how the old man had stood up and made his speech—tears came into her eyes; ah, if any one had ever said that to her! but then again, she felt how it was just this that condemned humanity for ever; never would they reach beyond affecting scenes with clocks; Brunners making speeches to Prickett Ellises, and the Prickett Ellises would always say how they had loved their kind; they would always be lazy, compromising, and afraid of beauty. Hence sprang revolutions; from laziness and fear and this love of affecting scenes. Still this man got pleasure from his Brunners; and she was condemned to suffer for ever and ever from her poor poor women shut out from squares. So they sat silent. Both were very unhappy. For Prickett Ellis was not in the least solaced by what he had said; instead of picking her thorn out he had rubbed it in; his happiness of the morning had been ruined. Miss O'Keefe was muddled and annoyed; she was muddy instead of clear.

"I am afraid I am one of those very ordinary people," he said, getting up, "who love their kind."

Upon which Miss O'Keefe almost shouted: "So do I."

Hating each other, hating the whole houseful of people who had given them this painful, this disillusioning evening, these two lovers of their kind got up, and without a word, parted for ever.





Lappin and Lapinova


They were married. The wedding march pealed out. The pigeons fluttered. Small boys in Eton jackets threw rice; a fox terrier sauntered across the path; and Ernest Thorburn led his bride to the car through the small inquisitive crowd of complete strangers which always collects in London to enjoy other people's happiness or unhappiness. Certainly he looked handsome and she looked shy. More rice was thrown, and the car moved off.

That was on Tuesday. Now it was Saturday. Rosalind had still to get used to the fact that she was Mrs. Ernest Thorburn. Perhaps she never would get used to the fact that she was Mrs. Ernest Anybody, she thought, as she sat in the bow window of the hotel looking over the lake to the mountains, and waited for her husband to come down to breakfast. Ernest was a difficult name to get used to. It was not the name she would have chosen. She would have preferred Timothy, Antony, or Peter. He did not look like Ernest either. The name suggested the Albert Memorial, mahogany sideboards, steel engravings of the Prince Consort with his family—her mother-in-law's dining-room in Porchester Terrace in short.

But here he was. Thank goodness he did not look like Ernest—no. But what did he look like? She glanced at him sideways. Well, when he was eating toast he looked like a rabbit. Not that anyone else would have seen a likeness to a creature so diminutive and timid in this spruce, muscular young man with the straight nose, the blue eyes, and the very firm mouth. But that made it all the more amusing. His nose twitched very slightly when he ate. So did her pet rabbit's. She kept watching his nose twitch; and then she had to explain, when he caught her looking at him, why she laughed.

"It's because you're like a rabbit, Ernest," she said. "Like a wild rabbit," she added, looking at him. "A hunting rabbit; a King Rabbit; a rabbit that makes laws for all the other rabbits."

Ernest had no objection to being that kind of rabbit, and since it amused her to see him twitch his nose—he had never known that his nose twitched—he twitched it on purpose. And she laughed and laughed; and he laughed too, so that the maiden ladies and the fishing man and the Swiss waiter in his greasy black jacket all guessed right; they were very happy. But how long does such happiness last? they asked themselves; and each answered according to his own circumstances.

At lunch time, seated on a clump of heather beside the lake, "Lettuce, rabbit?" said Rosalind, holding out the lettuce that had been provided to eat with the hard-boiled eggs. "Come and take it out of my hand," she added, and he stretched out and nibbled the lettuce and twitched his nose.

"Good rabbit, nice rabbit," she said, patting him, as she used to pat her tame rabbit at home. But that was absurd. He was not a tame rabbit, whatever he was. She turned it into French. "Lapin," she called him. But whatever he was, he was not a French rabbit. He was simply and solely English—born at Porchester Terrace, educated at Rugby; now a clerk in His Majesty's Civil Service. So she tried "Bunny" next; but that was worse. "Bunny" was someone plump and soft and comic; he was thin and hard and serious. Still, his nose twitched. "Lappin," she exclaimed suddenly; and gave a little cry as if she had found the very word she looked for.

"Lappin, Lappin, King Lappin," she repeated. It seemed to suit him exactly; he was not Ernest, he was King Lappin. Why? She did not know.

When there was nothing new to talk about on their long solitary walks—and it rained, as everyone had warned them that it would rain; or when they were sitting over the fire in the evening, for it was cold, and the maiden ladies had gone and the fishing man, and the waiter only came if you rang the bell for him, she let her fancy play with the story of the Lappin tribe. Under her hands—she was sewing; he was reading—they became very real, very vivid, very amusing. Ernest put down the paper and helped her. There were the black rabbits and the red; there were the enemy rabbits and the friendly. There were the wood in which they lived and the outlying prairies and the swamp. Above all there was King Lappin, who, far from having only the one trick—that he twitched his nose—became as the days passed an animal of the greatest character; Rosalind was always finding new qualities in him. But above all he was a great hunter.

"And what," said Rosalind, on the last day of the honeymoon, "did the King do to-day?"

In fact they had been climbing all day; and she had worn a blister on her heel; but she did not mean that.

"To-day," said Ernest, twitching his nose as he bit the end off his cigar, "he chased a hare." He paused; struck a match, and twitched again.

"A woman hare," he added.

"A white hare!" Rosalind exclaimed, as if she had been expecting this. "Rather a small hare; silver grey; with big bright eyes?"

"Yes," said Ernest, looking at her as she had looked at him, "a smallish animal; with eyes popping out of her head, and two little front paws dangling." It was exactly how she sat, with her sewing dangling in her hands; and her eyes, that were so big and bright, were certainly a little prominent.

"Ah, Lapinova," Rosalind murmured.

"Is that what she's called?" said Ernest—"the real Rosalind?" He looked at her. He felt very much in love with her.

"Yes; that's what she's called," said Rosalind. "Lapinova." And before they went to bed that night it was all settled. He was King Lappin; she was Queen Lapinova. They were the opposite of each other; he was bold and determined; she wary and undependable. He ruled over the busy world of rabbits; her world was a desolate, mysterious place, which she ranged mostly by moonlight. All the same, their territories touched; they were King and Queen.

Thus when they came back from their honeymoon they possessed a private world, inhabited, save for the one white hare, entirely by rabbits. No one guessed that there was such a place, and that of course made it all the more amusing. It made them feel, more even than most young married couples, in league together against the rest of the world. Often they looked slyly at each other when people talked about rabbits and woods and traps and shooting. Or they winked furtively across the table when Aunt Mary said that she could never bear to see a hare in a dish—it looked so like a baby: or when John, Ernest's sporting brother, told them what price rabbits were fetching that autumn in Wiltshire, skins and all. Sometimes when they wanted a gamekeeper, or a poacher or a Lord of the Manor, they amused themselves by distributing the parts among their friends. Ernest's mother, Mrs. Reginald Thorburn, for example, fitted the part of the Squire to perfection. But it was all secret—that was the point of it; nobody save themselves knew that such a world existed.

Without that world, how, Rosalind wondered, that winter could she have lived at all? For instance, there was the golden-wedding party, when all the Thorburns assembled at Porchester Terrace to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of that union which had been so blessed—had it not produced Ernest Thorburn? and so fruitful—had it not produced nine other sons and daughters into the bargain, many themselves married and also fruitful? She dreaded that party. But it was inevitable. As she walked upstairs she felt bitterly that she was an only child and an orphan at that; a mere drop among all those Thorburns assembled in the great drawing-room with the shiny satin wallpaper and the lustrous family portraits. The living Thorburns much resembled the painted; save that instead of painted lips they had real lips; out of which came jokes; jokes about schoolrooms, and how they had pulled the chair from under the governess; jokes about frogs and how they had put them between the virgin sheets of maiden ladies. As for herself, she had never even made an apple-pie bed. Holding her present in her hand she advanced toward her mother-in- law sumptuous in yellow satin; and toward her father-in-law decorated with a rich yellow carnation. All round them on tables and chairs there were golden tributes, some nestling in cotton wool; others branching resplendent—candlesticks; cigar boxes; chains; each stamped with the goldsmith's proof that it was solid gold, hall-marked, authentic. But her present was only a little pinchbeck box pierced with holes; an old sand caster, an eighteenth-century relic, once used to sprinkle sand over wet ink. Rather a senseless present she felt—in an age of blotting paper; and as she proffered it, she saw in front of her the stubby black handwriting in which her mother-in-law when they were engaged had expressed the hope that "My son will make you happy." No, she was not happy. Not at all happy. She looked at Ernest, straight as a ramrod with a nose like all the noses in the family portraits; a nose that never twitched at all.

Then they went down to dinner. She was half hidden by the great chrysanthemums that curled their red and gold petals into large tight balls. Everything was gold. A gold-edged card with gold initials intertwined recited the list of all the dishes that would be set one after another before them. She dipped her spoon in a plate of clear golden fluid. The raw white fog outside had been turned by the lamps into a golden mesh that blurred the edges of the plates and gave the pineapples a rough golden skin. Only she herself in her white wedding dress peering ahead of her with her prominent eyes seemed insoluble as an icicle.

As the dinner wore on, however, the room grew steamy with heat. Beads of perspiration stood out on the men's foreheads. She felt that her icicle was being turned to water. She was being melted; dispersed; dissolved into nothingness; and would soon faint. Then through the surge in her head and the din in her ears she heard a woman's voice exclaim, "But they breed so!"

The Thorburns-yes; they breed so, she echoed; looking at all the round red faces that seemed doubled in the giddiness that overcame her; and magnified in the gold mist that enhaloed them. "They breed so." Then John bawled:

"Little devils! ... Shoot 'em! Jump on 'em with big boots! That's the only way to deal with 'em ... rabbits!"

At that word, that magic word, she revived. Peeping between the chrysanthemums she saw Ernest's nose twitch. It rippled, it ran with successive twitches. And at that a mysterious catastrophe befell the Thorburns. The golden table became a moor with the gorse in full bloom; the din of voices turned to one peal of lark's laughter ringing down from the sky. It was a blue sky—clouds passed slowly. And they had all been changed—the Thorburns. She looked at her father-in-law, a furtive little man with dyed moustaches. His foible was collecting things—seals, enamel boxes, trifles from eighteenth-century dressing tables which he hid in the drawers of his study from his wife. Now she saw him as he was—a poacher, stealing off with his coat bulging with pheasants and partridges to drop them stealthily into a three-legged pot in his smoky little cottage. That was her real father-in-law—a poacher. And Celia, the unmarried daughter, who always nosed out other people's secrets, the little things they wished to hide—she was a white ferret with pink eyes, and a nose clotted with earth from her horrid underground nosings and pokings. Slung round men's shoulders, in a net, and thrust down a hole—it was a pitiable life—Celia's; it was none of her fault. So she saw Celia. And then she looked at her mother-in-law—whom they dubbed The Squire. Flushed, coarse, a bully—she was all that, as she stood returning thanks, but now that Rosalind—that is Lapinova—saw her, she saw behind her the decayed family mansion, the plaster peeling off the walls, and heard her, with a sob in her voice, giving thanks to her children (who hated her) for a world that had ceased to exist. There was a sudden silence. They all stood with their glasses raised; they all drank; then it was over.

"Oh, King Lappin!" she cried as they went home together in the fog, "if your nose hadn't twitched just at that moment, I should have been trapped!"

"But you're safe," said King Lappin, pressing her paw.

"Quite safe," she answered.

And they drove back through the Park, King and Queen of the marsh, of the mist, and of the gorse-scented moor.

Thus time passed; one year; two years of time. And on a winter's night, which happened by a coincidence to be the anniversary of the golden-wedding party—but Mrs. Reginald Thorburn was dead; the house was to let; and there was only a caretaker in residence—Ernest came home from the office. They had a nice little home; half a house above a saddler's shop in South Kensington, not far from the tube station. It was cold, with fog in the air, and Rosalind was sitting over the fire, sewing.

"What d'you think happened to me to-day?" she began as soon as he had settled himself down with his legs stretched to the blaze. "I was crossing the stream when—"

"What stream?" Ernest interrupted her.

"The stream at the bottom, where our wood meets the black wood," she explained.

Ernest looked completely blank for a moment.

"What the deuce are you talking about?" he asked.

"My dear Ernest!" she cried in dismay. "King Lappin," she added, dangling her little front paws in the firelight. But his nose did not twitch. Her hands—they turned to hands—clutched the stuff she was holding; her eyes popped half out of her head. It took him five minutes at least to change from Ernest Thorburn to King Lappin; and while she waited she felt a load on the back of her neck, as if somebody were about to wring it. At last he changed to King Lappin; his nose twitched; and they spent the evening roaming the woods much as usual.

But she slept badly. In the middle of the night she woke, feeling as if something strange had happened to her. She was stiff and cold. At last she turned on the light and looked at Ernest lying beside her. He was sound asleep. He snored. But even though he snored, his nose remained perfectly still. It looked as if it had never twitched at all. Was it possible that he was really Ernest; and that she was really married to Ernest? A vision of her mother-in-law's dining-room came before her; and there they sat, she and Ernest, grown old, under the engravings, in front of the sideboard. ... It was their golden-wedding day. She could not bear it.

"Lappin, King Lappin!" she whispered, and for a moment his nose seemed to twitch of its own accord. But he still slept. "Wake up, Lappin, wake up!" she cried.

Ernest woke; and seeing her sitting bolt upright beside him he asked:

"What's the matter?"

"I thought my rabbit was dead!" she whimpered. Ernest was angry.

"Don't talk such rubbish, Rosalind," he said. "Lie down and go to sleep."

He turned over. In another moment he was sound asleep and snoring.

But she could not sleep. She lay curled up on her side of the bed, like a hare in its form. She had turned out the light, but the street lamp lit the ceiling faintly, and the trees outside made a lacy network over it as if there were a shadowy grove on the ceiling in which she wandered, turning, twisting, in and out, round and round, hunting, being hunted, hearing the bay of hounds and horns; flying, escaping ... until the maid drew the blinds and brought their early tea.

Next day she could settle to nothing. She seemed to have lost something. She felt as if her body had shrunk; it had grown small, and black and hard. Her joints seemed stiff too, and when she looked in the glass, which she did several times as she wandered about the flat, her eyes seemed to burst out of her head, like currants in a bun. The rooms also seemed to have shrunk. Large pieces of furniture jutted out at odd angles and she found herself knocking against them. At last she put on her hat and went out. She walked along the Cromwell Road; and every room she passed and peered into seemed to be a dining-room where people sat eating under steel engravings, with thick yellow lace curtains, and mahogany sideboards. At last she reached the Natural History Museum; she used to like it when she was a child. But the first thing she saw when she went in was a stuffed hare standing on sham snow with pink glass eyes. Somehow it made her shiver all over. Perhaps it would be better when dusk fell. She went home and sat over the fire, without a light, and tried to imagine that she was out alone on a moor; and there was a stream rushing; and beyond the stream a dark wood. But she could get no further than the stream. At last she squatted down on the bank on the wet grass, and sat crouched in her chair, with her hands dangling empty, and her eyes glazed, like glass eyes, in the firelight. Then there was the crack of a gun... . She started as if she had been shot. It was only Ernest, turning his key in the door. She waited, trembling. He came in and switched on the light. There he stood tall, handsome, rubbing his hands that were red with cold.

"Sitting in the dark?" he said.

"Oh, Ernest, Ernest!" she cried, starting up in her chair.

"Well, what's up now?" he asked briskly, warming his hands at the fire.

"It's Lapinova..." she faltered, glancing wildly at him out of her great startled eyes. "She's gone, Ernest. I've lost her!"

Ernest frowned. He pressed his lips tight together. "Oh, that's what's up, is it?" he said, smiling rather grimly at his wife. For ten seconds he stood there, silent; and she waited, feeling hands tightening at the back of her neck.

"Yes," he said at length. "Poor Lapinova..." He straightened his tie at the looking-glass over the mantelpiece.

"Caught in a trap," he said, "killed," and sat down and read the newspaper.

So that was the end of that marriage.





Solid Objects


The only thing that moved upon the vast semicircle of the beach was one small black spot. As it came nearer to the ribs and spine of the stranded pilchard boat, it became apparent from a certain tenuity in its blackness that this spot possessed four legs; and moment by moment it became more unmistakable that it was composed of the persons of two young men. Even thus in outline against the sand there was an unmistakable vitality in them; an indescribable vigour in the approach and withdrawal of the bodies, slight though it was, which proclaimed some violent argument issuing from the tiny mouths of the little round heads. This was corroborated on closer view by the repeated lunging of a walking-stick on the right-hand side. "You mean to tell me ... You actually believe ..." thus the walking-stick on the right-hand side next the waves seemed to be asserting as it cut long straight stripes on the sand.

"Politics be damned!" issued clearly from the body on the left- hand side, and, as these words were uttered, the mouths, noses, chins, little moustaches, tweed caps, rough boots, shooting coats, and check stockings of the two speakers became clearer and clearer; the smoke of their pipes went up into the air; nothing was so solid, so living, so hard, red, hirsute and virile as these two bodies for miles and miles of sea and sandhill.

They flung themselves down by the six ribs and spine of the black pilchard boat. You know how the body seems to shake itself free from an argument, and to apologize for a mood of exaltation; flinging itself down and expressing in the looseness of its attitude a readiness to take up with something new—whatever it may be that comes next to hand. So Charles, whose stick had been slashing the beach for half a mile or so, began skimming flat pieces of slate over the water; and John, who had exclaimed "Politics be damned!" began burrowing his fingers down, down, into the sand. As his hand went further and further beyond the wrist, so that he had to hitch his sleeve a little higher, his eyes lost their intensity, or rather the background of thought and experience which gives an inscrutable depth to the eyes of grown people disappeared, leaving only the clear transparent surface, expressing nothing but wonder, which the eyes of young children display. No doubt the act of burrowing in the sand had something to do with it. He remembered that, after digging for a little, the water oozes round your finger-tips; the hole then becomes a moat; a well; a spring; a secret channel to the sea. As he was choosing which of these things to make it, still working his fingers in the water, they curled round something hard—a full drop of solid matter—and gradually dislodged a large irregular lump, and brought it to the surface. When the sand coating was wiped off, a green tint appeared. It was a lump of glass, so thick as to be almost opaque; the smoothing of the sea had completely worn off any edge or shape, so that it was impossible to say whether it had been bottle, tumbler or window-pane; it was nothing but glass; it was almost a precious stone. You had only to enclose it in a rim of gold, or pierce it with a wire, and it became a jewel; part of a necklace, or a dull, green light upon a finger. Perhaps after all it was really a gem; something worn by a dark Princess trailing her finger in the water as she sat in the stern of the boat and listened to the slaves singing as they rowed her across the Bay. Or the oak sides of a sunk Elizabethan treasure-chest had split apart, and, rolled over and over, over and over, its emeralds had come at last to shore. John turned it in his hands; he held it to the light; he held it so that its irregular mass blotted out the body and extended right arm of his friend. The green thinned and thickened slightly as it was held against the sky or against the body. It pleased him; it puzzled him; it was so hard, so concentrated, so definite an object compared with the vague sea and the hazy shore.

Now a sigh disturbed him—profound, final, making him aware that his friend Charles had thrown all the flat stones within reach, or had come to the conclusion that it was not worth while to throw them. They ate their sandwiches side by side. When they had done, and were shaking themselves and rising to their feet, John took the lump of glass and looked at it in silence. Charles looked at it too. But he saw immediately that it was not flat, and filling his pipe he said with the energy that dismisses a foolish strain of thought:

"To return to what I was saying—"

He did not see, or if he had seen would hardly have noticed, that John after looking at the lump for a moment, as if in hesitation, slipped it inside his pocket. That impulse, too, may have been the impulse which leads a child to pick up one pebble on a path strewn with them, promising it a life of warmth and security upon the nursery mantelpiece, delighting in the sense of power and benignity which such an action confers, and believing that the heart of the stone leaps with joy when it sees itself chosen from a million like it, to enjoy this bliss instead of a life of cold and wet upon the high road. "It might so easily have been any other of the millions of stones, but it was I, I, I!"

Whether this thought or not was in John's mind, the lump of glass had its place upon the mantelpiece, where it stood heavy upon a little pile of bills and letters, and served not only as an excellent paper-weight, but also as a natural stopping place for the young man's eyes when they wandered from his book. Looked at again and again half consciously by a mind thinking of something else, any object mixes itself so profoundly with the stuff of thought that it loses its actual form and recomposes itself a little differently in an ideal shape which haunts the brain when we least expect it. So John found himself attracted to the windows of curiosity shops when he was out walking, merely because he saw something which reminded him of the lump of glass. Anything, so long as it was an object of some kind, more or less round, perhaps with a dying flame deep sunk in its mass, anything—china, glass, amber, rock, marble—even the smooth oval egg of a prehistoric bird would do. He took, also, to keeping his eyes upon the ground, especially in the neighbourhood of waste land where the household refuse is thrown away. Such objects often occurred there—thrown away, of no use to anybody, shapeless, discarded. In a few months he had collected four or five specimens that took their place upon the mantelpiece. They were useful, too, for a man who is standing for Parliament upon the brink of a brilliant career has any number of papers to keep in order—addresses to constituents, declarations of policy, appeals for subscriptions, invitations to dinner, and so on.

One day, starting from his rooms in the Temple to catch a train in order to address his constituents, his eyes rested upon a remarkable object lying half-hidden in one of those little borders of grass which edge the bases of vast legal buildings. He could only touch it with the point of his stick through the railings; but he could see that it was a piece of china of the most remarkable shape, as nearly resembling a starfish as anything—shaped, or broken accidentally, into five irregular but unmistakable points. The colouring was mainly blue, but green stripes or spots of some kind overlaid the blue, and lines of crimson gave it a richness and lustre of the most attractive kind. John was determined to possess it; but the more he pushed, the further it receded. At length he was forced to go back to his rooms and improvise a wire ring attached to the end of a stick, with which, by dint of great care and skill, he finally drew the piece of china within reach of his hands. As he seized hold of it he exclaimed in triumph. At that moment the clock struck. It was out of the question that he should keep his appointment. The meeting was held without him. But how had the piece of china been broken into this remarkable shape? A careful examination put it beyond doubt that the star shape was accidental, which made it all the more strange, and it seemed unlikely that there should be another such in existence. Set at the opposite end of the mantelpiece from the lump of glass that had been dug from the sand, it looked like a creature from another world—freakish and fantastic as a harlequin. It seemed to be pirouetting through space, winking light like a fitful star. The contrast between the china so vivid and alert, and the glass so mute and contemplative, fascinated him, and wondering and amazed he asked himself how the two came to exist in the same world, let alone to stand upon the same narrow strip of marble in the same room. The question remained unanswered.

He now began to haunt the places which are most prolific of broken china, such as pieces of waste land between railway lines, sites of demolished houses, and commons in the neighbourhood of London. But china is seldom thrown from a great height; it is one of the rarest of human actions. You have to find in conjunction a very high house, and a woman of such reckless impulse and passionate prejudice that she flings her jar or pot straight from the window without thought of who is below. Broken china was to be found in plenty, but broken in some trifling domestic accident, without purpose or character. Nevertheless, he was often astonished, as he came to go into the question more deeply, by the immense variety of shapes to be found in London alone, and there was still more cause for wonder and speculation in the differences of qualities and designs. The finest specimens he would bring home and place upon his mantelpiece, where, however, their duty was more and more of an ornamental nature, since papers needing a weight to keep them down became scarcer and scarcer.

He neglected his duties, perhaps, or discharged them absent- mindedly, or his constituents when they visited him were unfavourably impressed by the appearance of his mantelpiece. At any rate he was not elected to represent them in Parliament, and his friend Charles, taking it much to heart and hurrying to condole with him, found him so little cast down by the disaster that he could only suppose that it was too serious a matter for him to realize all at once.

In truth, John had been that day to Barnes Common, and there under a furze bush had found a very remarkable piece of iron. It was almost identical with the glass in shape, massy and globular, but so cold and heavy, so black and metallic, that it was evidently alien to the earth and had its origin in one of the dead stars or was itself the cinder of a moon. It weighed his pocket down; it weighed the mantelpiece down; it radiated cold. And yet the meteorite stood upon the same ledge with the lump of glass and the star-shaped china.

As his eyes passed from one to another, the determination to possess objects that even surpassed these tormented the young man. He devoted himself more and more resolutely to the search. If he had not been consumed by ambition and convinced that one day some newly- discovered rubbish heap would reward him, the disappointments he had suffered, let alone the fatigue and derision, would have made him give up the pursuit. Provided with a bag and a long stick fitted with an adaptable hook, he ransacked all deposits of earth; raked beneath matted tangles of scrub; searched all alleys and spaces between walls where he had learned to expect to find objects of this kind thrown away. As his standard became higher and his taste more severe the disappointments were innumerable, but always some gleam of hope, some piece of china or glass curiously marked or broken lured him on. Day after day passed. He was no longer young. His career—that is his political career—was a thing of the past. People gave up visiting him. He was too silent to be worth asking to dinner. He never talked to anyone about his serious ambitions; their lack of understanding was apparent in their behaviour.

He leaned back in his chair now and watched Charles lift the stones on the mantelpiece a dozen times and put them down emphatically to mark what he was saying about the conduct of the Government, without once noticing their existence.

"What was the truth of it, John?" asked Charles suddenly, turning and facing him. "What made you give it up like that all in a second?"

"I've not given it up," John replied.

"But you've not a ghost of a chance now," said Charles roughly.

"I don't agree with you there," said John with conviction. Charles looked at him and was profoundly uneasy; the most extraordinary doubts possessed him; he had a queer sense that they were talking about different things. He looked round to find some relief for his horrible depression, but the disorderly appearance of the room depressed him still further. What was that stick, and the old carpet bag hanging against the wall? And then those stones? Looking at John, something fixed and distant in his expression alarmed him. He knew only too well that his mere appearance upon a platform was out of the question.

"Pretty stones," he said as cheerfully as he could; and saying that he had an appointment to keep, he left John—for ever.





The Duchess and the Jeweller


Oliver Bacon lived at the top of a house overlooking the Green Park. He had a flat; chairs jutted out at the right angles—chairs covered in hide. Sofas filled the bays of the windows—sofas covered in tapestry. The windows, the three long windows, had the proper allowance of discreet net and figured satin. The mahogany sideboard bulged discreetly with the right brandies, whiskeys and liqueurs. And from the middle window he looked down upon the glossy roofs of fashionable cars packed in the narrow straits of Piccadilly. A more central position could not be imagined. And at eight in the morning he would have his breakfast brought in on a tray by a man-servant: the man-servant would unfold his crimson dressing-gown; he would rip his letters open with his long pointed nails and would extract thick white cards of invitation upon which the engraving stood up roughly from duchesses, countesses, viscountesses and Honourable Ladies. Then he would wash; then he would eat his toast; then he would read his paper by the bright burning fire of electric coals.

"Behold Oliver," he would say, addressing himself. "You who began life in a filthy little alley, you who ..." and he would look down at his legs, so shapely in their perfect trousers; at his boots; at his spats. They were all shapely, shining; cut from the best cloth by the best scissors in Savile Row. But he dismantled himself often and became again a little boy in a dark alley. He had once thought that the height of his ambition—selling stolen dogs to fashionable women in Whitechapel. And once he had been done. "Oh, Oliver," his mother had wailed. "Oh, Oliver! When will you have sense, my son?" ... Then he had gone behind a counter; had sold cheap watches; then he had taken a wallet to Amsterdam. ... At that memory he would chuckle—the old Oliver remembering the young. Yes, he had done well with the three diamonds; also there was the commission on the emerald. After that he went into the private room behind the shop in Hatton Garden; the room with the scales, the safe, the thick magnifying glasses. And then ... and then ... He chuckled. When he passed through the knots of jewellers in the hot evening who were discussing prices, gold mines, diamonds, reports from South Africa, one of them would lay a finger to the side of his nose and murmur, "Hum—m—m," as he passed. It was no more than a murmur; no more than a nudge on the shoulder, a finger on the nose, a buzz that ran through the cluster of jewellers in Hatton Garden on a hot afternoon—oh, many years ago now! But still Oliver felt it purring down his spine, the nudge, the murmur that meant, "Look at him—young Oliver, the young jeweller—there he goes." Young he was then. And he dressed better and better; and had, first a hansom cab; then a car; and first he went up to the dress circle, then down into the stalls. And he had a villa at Richmond, overlooking the river, with trellises of red roses; and Mademoiselle used to pick one every morning and stick it in his buttonhole.

"So," said Oliver Bacon, rising and stretching his legs. "So ..."

And he stood beneath the picture of an old lady on the mantelpiece and raised his hands. "I have kept my word," he said, laying his hands together, palm to palm, as if he were doing homage to her. "I have won my bet." That was so; he was the richest jeweller in England; but his nose, which was long and flexible, like an elephant's trunk, seemed to say by its curious quiver at the nostrils (but it seemed as if the whole nose quivered, not only the nostrils) that he was not satisfied yet; still smelt something under the ground a little further off. Imagine a giant hog in a pasture rich with truffles; after unearthing this truffle and that, still it smells a bigger, a blacker truffle under the ground further off. So Oliver snuffed always in the rich earth of Mayfair another truffle, a blacker, a bigger further off.

Now then he straightened the pearl in his tie, cased himself in his smart blue overcoat; took his yellow gloves and his cane; and swayed as he descended the stairs and half snuffed, half sighed through his long sharp nose as he passed out into Piccadilly. For was he not still a sad man, a dissatisfied man, a man who seeks something that is hidden, though he had won his bet?

He swayed slightly as he walked, as the camel at the zoo sways from side to side when it walks along the asphalt paths laden with grocers and their wives eating from paper bags and throwing little bits of silver paper crumpled up on to the path. The camel despises the grocers; the camel is dissatisfied with its lot; the camel sees the blue lake and the fringe of palm trees in front of it. So the great jeweller, the greatest jeweller in the whole world, swung down Piccadilly, perfectly dressed, with his gloves, with his cane; but dissatisfied still, till he reached the dark little shop, that was famous in France, in Germany, in Austria, in Italy, and all over America—the dark little shop in the street off Bond Street.

As usual, he strode through the shop without speaking, though the four men, the two old men, Marshall and Spencer, and the two young men, Hammond and Wicks, stood straight and looked at him, envying him. It was only with one finger of the amber-coloured glove, waggling, that he acknowledged their presence. And he went in and shut the door of his private room behind him.

Then he unlocked the grating that barred the window. The cries of Bond Street came in; the purr of the distant traffic. The light from reflectors at the back of the shop struck upwards. One tree waved six green leaves, for it was June. But Mademoiselle had married Mr. Pedder of the local brewery—no one stuck roses in his buttonhole now.

"So," he half sighed, half snorted, "so ..."

Then he touched a spring in the wall and slowly the panelling slid open, and behind it were the steel safes, five, no, six of them, all of burnished steel. He twisted a key; unlocked one; then another. Each was lined with a pad of deep crimson velvet; in each lay jewels— bracelets, necklaces, rings, tiaras, ducal coronets; loose stones in glass shells; rubies, emeralds, pearls, diamonds. All safe, shining, cool, yet burning, eternally, with their own compressed light.

"Tears!" said Oliver, looking at the pearls.

"Heart's blood!" he said, looking at the rubies.

"Gunpowder!" he continued, rattling the diamonds so that they flashed and blazed.

"Gunpowder enough to blow Mayfair—sky high, high, high!" He threw his head back and made a sound like a horse neighing as he said it.

The telephone buzzed obsequiously in a low muted voice on his table. He shut the safe.

"In ten minutes," he said. "Not before." And he sat down at his desk and looked at the heads of the Roman emperors that were graved on his sleeve links. And again he dismantled himself and became once more the little boy playing marbles in the alley where they sell stolen dogs on Sunday. He became that wily astute little boy, with lips like wet cherries. He dabbled his fingers in ropes of tripe; he dipped them in pans of frying fish; he dodged in and out among the crowds. He was slim, lissome, with eyes like licked stones. And now—now—the hands of the clock ticked on. One, two, three, four... . The Duchess of Lambourne waited his pleasure; the Duchess of Lambourne, daughter of a hundred Earls. She would wait for ten minutes on a chair at the counter. She would wait his pleasure. She would wait till he was ready to see her. He watched the clock in its shagreen case. The hand moved on. With each tick the clock handed him—so it seemed—pâté de foie gras; a glass of champagne; another of fine brandy; a cigar costing one guinea. The clock laid them on the table beside him, as the ten minutes passed. Then he heard soft slow footsteps approaching; a rustle in the corridor. The door opened. Mr. Hammond flattened himself against the wall.

"Her Grace!" he announced.

And he waited there, flattened against the wall.

And Oliver, rising, could hear the rustle of the dress of the Duchess as she came down the passage. Then she loomed up, filling the door, filling the room with the aroma, the prestige, the arrogance, the pomp, the pride of all the Dukes and Duchesses swollen in one wave. And as a wave breaks, she broke, as she sat down, spreading and splashing and falling over Oliver Bacon the great jeweller, covering him with sparkling bright colours, green, rose, violet; and odours; and iridescences; and rays shooting from fingers, nodding from plumes, flashing from silk; for she was very large, very fat, tightly girt in pink taffeta, and past her prime. As a parasol with many flounces, as a peacock with many feathers, shuts its flounces, folds its feathers, so she subsided and shut herself as she sank down in the leather armchair.

"Good morning, Mr. Bacon," said the Duchess. And she held out her hand which came through the slit of her white glove. And Oliver bent low as he shook it. And as their hands touched the link was forged between them once more. They were friends, yet enemies; he was master, she was mistress; each cheated the other, each needed the other, each feared the other, each felt this and knew this every time they touched hands thus in the little back room with the white light outside, and the tree with its six leaves, and the sound of the street in the distance and behind them the safes.

"And to-day, Duchess—what can I do for you to-day?" said Oliver, very softly.

The Duchess opened; her heart, her private heart, gaped wide. And with a sigh, but no words, she took from her bag a long wash- leather pouch—it looked like a lean yellow ferret. And from a slit in the ferret's belly she dropped pearls—ten pearls. They rolled from the slit in the ferret's belly—one, two, three, four—like the eggs of some heavenly bird.

"All that's left me, dear Mr. Bacon," she moaned. Five, six, seven—down they rolled, down the slopes of the vast mountain sides that fell between her knees into one narrow valley—the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth. There they lay in the glow of the peach-blossom taffeta. Ten pearls.

"From the Appleby cincture," she mourned. "The last... the last of them all."

Oliver stretched out and took one of the pearls between finger and thumb. It was round, it was lustrous. But real was it, or false? Was she lying again? Did she dare?

She laid her plump padded finger across her lips. "If the Duke knew ..." she whispered. "Dear Mr. Bacon, a bit of bad luck ..."

Been gambling again, had she?

"That villain! That sharper!" she hissed.

The man with the chipped cheek bone? A bad 'un. And the Duke was straight as a poker; with side whiskers; would cut her off, shut her up down there if he knew—what I know, thought Oliver, and glanced at the safe.

"Araminta, Daphne, Diana," she moaned. "It's for them. "

The ladies Araminta, Daphne, Diana—her daughters. He knew them; adored them. But it was Diana he loved.

"You have all my secrets," she leered. Tears slid; tears fell; tears, like diamonds, collecting powder in the ruts of her cherry-blossom cheeks.

"Old friend," she murmured, "old friend."

"Old friend," he repeated, "old friend," as if he licked the words.

"How much?" he queried.

She covered the pearls with her hand.

"Twenty thousand," she whispered.

But was it real or false, the one he held in his hand? The Appleby cincture—hadn't she sold it already? He would ring for Spencer or Hammond. "Take it and test it," he would say. He stretched to the bell.

"You will come down to-morrow?" she urged, she interrupted. "The Prime Minister—His Royal Highness ..." She stopped. "And Diana," she added.

Oliver took his hand off the bell.

He looked past her, at the backs of the houses in Bond Street. But he saw, not the houses in Bond Street, but a dimpling river; and trout rising and salmon; and the Prime Minister; and himself too, in white waistcoats; and then, Diana. He looked down at the pearl in his hand. But how could he test it, in the light of the river, in the light of the eyes of Diana? But the eyes of the Duchess were on him.

"Twenty thousand," she moaned. "My honour!"

The honour of the mother of Diana! He drew his cheque book towards him; he took out his pen.

"Twenty," he wrote. Then he stopped writing. The eyes of the old woman in the picture were on him—of the old woman his mother.

"Oliver!" she warned him. "Have sense! Don't be a fool!"

"Oliver!" the Duchess entreated—it was "Oliver" now, not "Mr. Bacon." "You'll come for a long week-end?"

Alone in the woods with Diana! Riding alone in the woods with Diana!

"Thousand," he wrote, and signed it.

"Here you are," he said.

And there opened all the flounces of the parasol, all the plumes of the peacock, the radiance of the wave, the swords and spears of Agincourt, as she rose from her chair. And the two old men and the two young men, Spencer and Marshall, Wicks and Hammond, flattened themselves behind the counter envying him as he led her through the shop to the door. And he waggled his yellow glove in their faces, and she held her honour—a cheque for twenty thousand pounds with his signature—quite firmly in her hands.

"Are they false or are they real?" asked Oliver, shutting his private door. There they were, ten pearls on the blotting paper on the table. He took them to the window. He held them under his lens to the light... . This, then, was the truffle he had routed out of the earth! Rotten at the centre—rotten at the core!

"Forgive me, oh, my mother!" he sighed, raising his hand as if he asked pardon of the old woman in the picture. And again he was a little boy in the alley where they sold dogs on Sunday.

"For," he murmured, laying the palms of his hands together, "it is to be a long week-end."





The Legacy


"For Sissy Miller." Gilbert Clandon, taking up the pearl brooch that lay among a litter of rings and brooches on a little table in his wife's drawing-room, read the inscription: "For Sissy Miller, with my love."

It was like Angela to have remembered even Sissy Miller, her secretary. Yet how strange it was, Gilbert Clandon thought once more, that she had left everything in such order—a little gift of some sort for every one of her friends. It was as if she had foreseen her death. Yet she had been in perfect health when she left the house that morning, six weeks ago; when she stepped off the kerb in Piccadilly and the car had killed her.

He was waiting for Sissy Miller. He had asked her to come; he owed her, he felt, after all the years she had been with them, this token of consideration. Yes, he went on, as he sat there waiting, it was strange that Angela had left everything in such order. Every friend had been left some little token of her affection. Every ring, every necklace, every little Chinese box—she had a passion for little boxes—had a name on it. And each had some memory for him. This he had given her; this—the enamel dolphin with the ruby eyes—she had pounced upon one day in a back street in Venice. He could remember her little cry of delight. To him, of course, she had left nothing in particular, unless it were her diary. Fifteen little volumes, bound in green leather, stood behind him on her writing table. Ever since they were married, she had kept a diary. Some of their very few—he could not call them quarrels, say tiffs—had been about that diary. When he came in and found her writing, she always shut it or put her hand over it. "No, no, no," he could hear her say, "After I'm dead—perhaps." So she had left it him, as her legacy. It was the only thing they had not shared when she was alive. But he had always taken it for granted that she would outlive him. If only she had stopped one moment, and had thought what she was doing, she would be alive now. But she had stepped straight off the kerb, the driver of the car had said at the inquest. She had given him no chance to pull up... . Here the sound of voices in the hall interrupted him.

"Miss Miller, Sir," said the maid.

She came in. He had never seen her alone in his life, nor, of course, in tears. She was terribly distressed, and no wonder. Angela had been much more to her than an employer. She had been a friend. To himself, he thought, as he pushed a chair for her and asked her to sit down, she was scarcely distinguishable from any other woman of her kind. There were thousands of Sissy Millers—drab little women in black carrying attaché cases. But Angela, with her genius for sympathy, had discovered all sorts of qualities in Sissy Miller. She was the soul of discretion, so silent; so trustworthy, one could tell her anything, and so on.

Miss Miller could not speak at first. She sat there dabbing her eyes with her pocket handkerchief. Then she made an effort.

"Pardon me, Mr. Clandon," she said.

He murmured. Of course he understood. It was only natural. He could guess what his wife had meant to her.

"I've been so happy here," she said, looking round. Her eyes rested on the writing table behind him. It was here they had worked— she and Angela. For Angela had her share of the duties that fall to the lot of a prominent politician's wife. She had been the greatest help to him in his career. He had often seen her and Sissy sitting at that table—Sissy at the typewriter, taking down letters from her dictation. No doubt Miss Miller was thinking of that, too. Now all he had to do was to give her the brooch his wife had left her. A rather incongruous gift it seemed. It might have been better to have left her a sum of money, or even the typewriter. But there it was—"For Sissy Miller, with my love." And, taking the brooch, he gave it her with the little speech that he had prepared. He knew, he said, that she would value it. His wife had often worn it. ... And she replied, as she took it almost as if she too had prepared a speech, that it would always be a treasured possession.... She had, he supposed, other clothes upon which a pearl brooch would not look quite so incongruous. She was wearing the little black coat and skirt that seemed the uniform of her profession. Then he remembered—she was in mourning, of course. She, too, had had her tragedy—a brother, to who m she was devoted, had died only a week or two before Angela. In some accident was it? He could not remember—only Angela telling him. Angela, with her genius for sympathy, had been terribly upset. Meanwhile Sissy Miller had risen. She was putting on her gloves. Evidently she felt that she ought not to intrude. But he could not let her go without saying something about her future. What were her plans? Was there any way in which he could help her?

She was gazing at the table, where she had sat at her typewriter, where the diary lay. And, lost in her memories of Angela, she did not at once answer his suggestion that he should help her. She seemed for a moment not to understand. So he repeated:

"What are your plans, Miss Miller?"

"My plans? Oh, that's all right, Mr. Clandon," she exclaimed. "Please don't bother yourself about me."

He took her to mean that she was in no need of financial assistance. It would be better, he realized, to make any suggestion of that kind in a letter. All he could do now was to say as he pressed her hand. "Remember, Miss Miller, if there's any way in which I can help you, it will be a pleasure. ..." Then he opened the door. For a moment, on the threshold, as if a sudden thought had struck her, she stopped.

"Mr. Clandon," she said, looking straight at him for the first time, and for the first time he was struck by the expression, sympathetic yet searching, in her eyes. "If at any time," [she] was saying, "there's anything I can do to help you, remember, I shall feel it, for your wife's sake, a pleasure ..."

With that she was gone. Her words and the look that went with them were unexpected. It was almost as if she believed, or hoped, that he would have need of her. A curious, perhaps a fantastic idea occurred to him as he returned to his chair. Could it be, that during all those years when he had scarcely noticed her, she, as the novelists say, had entertained a passion for him? He caught his own reflection in the glass as he passed. He was over fifty; but he could not help admitting that he was still, as the looking-glass showed him, a very distinguished-looking man.

"Poor Sissy Miller!" he said, half laughing. How he would have liked to share that joke with his wife! He turned instinctively to her diary. "Gilbert," he read, opening it at random, "looked so wonderful. ..." It was as if she had answered his question. Of course, she seemed to say, you're very attractive to women. Of course Sissy Miller felt that too. He read on. "How proud I am to be his wife!" And he had always been very proud to be her husband. How often, when they dined out somewhere, he had looked at her across the table and said to himself, She is the loveliest woman here! He read on. That first year he had been standing for Parliament. They had toured his constituency. "When Gilbert sat down the applause was terrific. The whole audience rose and sang: 'For he's a jolly good fellow.' I was quite overcome." He remembered that, too. She had been sitting on the platform beside him. He could still see the glance she cast at him, and how she had tears in her eyes. And then? He turned the pages. They had gone to Venice. He recalled that happy holiday after the election. "We had ices at Florians." He smiled—she was still such a child; she loved ices. "Gilbert gave me a most interesting account of the history of Venice. He told me that the Doges ..." she had written it all out in her schoolgirl hand. One of the delights of travelling with Angela had been that she was so eager to learn. She was so terribly ignorant, she used to say, as if that were not one of her charms. And then—he opened the next volume—they had come back to London. "I was so anxious to make a good impression. I wore my wedding dress." He could see her now sitting next old Sir Edward; and making a conquest of that formidable old man, his chief. He read on rapidly, filling in scene after scene from her scrappy fragments. "Dined at the House of Commons. ... To an evening party at the Lovegroves. Did I realize my responsibility, Lady L. asked me, as Gilbert's wife?" Then, as the years passed—he took another volume from the writing table—he had become more and more absorbed in his work. And she, of course, was more often alone. ... It had been a great grief to her, apparently, that they had had no children. "How I wish," one entry read, "that Gilbert had a son!" Oddly enough he had never much regretted that himself. Life had been so full, so rich as it was. That year he had been given a minor post in the government. A minor post only, but her comment was: "I am quite certain now that he will be Prime Minister!" Well, if things had gone differently, it might have been so. He paused here to speculate upon what might have been. Politics was a gamble, he reflected; but the game wasn't over yet. Not at fifty. He cast his eyes rapidly over more pages, full of the little trifles, the insignificant, happy, daily trifles that had made up her life.

He took up another volume and opened it at random. "What a coward I am! I let the chance slip again. But it seemed selfish to bother him with my own affairs, when he has so much to think about. And we so seldom have an evening alone." What was the meaning of that? Oh, here was the explanation—it referred to her work in the East End. "I plucked up courage and talked to Gilbert at last. He was so kind, so good. He made no objection." He remembered that conversation. She had told him that she felt so idle, so useless. She wished to have some work of her own. She wanted to do something—she had blushed so prettily, he remembered, as she said it, sitting in that very chair—to help others. He had bantered her a little. Hadn't she enough to do looking after him, after her home? Still, if it amused her, of course he had no objection. What was it? Some district? Some committee? Only she must promise not to make herself ill. So it seemed that every Wednesday she went to Whitechapel. He remembered how he hated the clothes she wore on those occasions. But she had taken it very seriously, it seemed. The diary was full of references like this: "Saw Mrs. Jones ... She has ten children... . Husband lost his arm in an accident... . Did my best to find a job for Lily." He skipped on. His own name occurred less frequently. His interest slackened. Some of the entries conveyed nothing to him. For example: "Had a heated argument about socialism with B. M." Who was B. M.? He could not fill in the initials; some woman[,] he supposed[,] that she had met on one of her committees. "B. M. made a violent attack upon the upper classes. ... I walked back after the meeting with B. M. and tried to convince him. But he is so narrow-minded." So B. M. was a man—no doubt one of those "intellectuals", as they call themselves, who are so violent, as Angela said, and so narrowminded. She had invited him to come and see her apparently. "B. M. came to dinner. He shook hands with Minnie!" That note of exclamation gave another twist to his mental picture. B. M., it seemed, wasn't used to parlourmaids; he had shaken hands with Minnie. Presumably he was one of those tame working men who air their views in ladies' drawing-rooms. Gilbert knew the type, and had no liking for this particular specimen, whoever B. M. might be. Here he was again. "Went with B. M. to the Tower of London. ... He said revolution is bound to come ... He said we live in a Fool's Paradise." That was just the kind of thing B. M. would say—Gilbert could hear him. He could also see him quite distinctly—a stubby little man, with a rough beard, red tie, dressed as they always did in tweeds, who had never done an honest day's work in his life. Surely Angela had the sense to see through him? He read on. "B. M. said some very disagreeable things about..." The name was carefully scratched out. "I told him I would not listen to any more abuse of..." Again the name was obliterated. Could it have been his own name? Was that why Angela covered the page so quickly when he came in? The thought added to his growing dislike of B. M. He had had the impertinence to discuss him in this very room. Why had Angela never told him? It was very unlike her to conceal anything; she had been the soul of candour. He turned the pages, picking out every reference to B. M. "B. M. told me the story of his childhood. His mother went out charring ... When I think of it, I can hardly bear to go on living in such luxury... . Three guineas for one hat!" If only she had discussed the matter with him, instead of puzzling her poor little head about questions that were much too difficult for her to understand! He had lent her books. Karl Marx. "The Coming Revolution". The initials B.M., B. M., B. M., recurred repeatedly. But why never the full name? There was an informality, an intimacy in the use of initials that was very unlike Angela. Had she called him B. M. to his face? He read on. "B. M. came unexpectedly after dinner. Luckily, I was alone." That was only a year ago. "Luckily"—why luckily?—"I was alone." Where had he been that night? He checked the date in his engagement book. It had been the night of the Mansion House dinner. And B. M. and Angela had spent the evening alone! He tried to recall that evening. Was she waiting up for him when he came back? Had the room looked just as usual? Were there glasses on the table? Were the chairs drawn close together? He could remember nothing—nothing whatever, nothing except his own speech at the Mansion House dinner. It became more and more inexplicable to him—the whole situation; his wife receiving an unknown man alone. Perhaps the next volume would explain. Hastily he reached for the last of the diaries—the one she had left unfinished when she died. There, on the very first page, was that cursed fellow again. "Dined alone with B. M... . He became very agitated. He said it was time we understood each other. ... I tried to make him listen. But he would not. He threatened that if I did not... " the rest of the page was scored over. She had written "Egypt. Egypt. Egypt," over the whole page. He could not make out a single word; but there could be only one interpretation: the scoundrel had asked her to become his mistress. Alone in his room! The blood rushed to Gilbert Clandon's face. He turned the pages rapidly. What had been her answer? Initials had ceased. It was simply "he" now. "He came again. I told him I could not come to any decision. ... I implored him to leave me." He had forced himself upon her in this very house. But why hadn't she told him? How could she have hesitated for an instant? Then: "I wrote him a letter." Then pages were left blank. Then there was this: "No answer to my letter." Then more blank pages; and then this: "He has done what he threatened." After that—what came after that? He turned page after page. All were blank. But there[,] on the very day before her death[,] was this entry: "Have I the courage to do it too?" That was the end.

Gilbert Clandon let the book slide to the floor. He could see her in front of him. She was standing on the kerb in Piccadilly. Her eyes stared; her fists were clenched. Here came the car....

He could not bear it. He must know the truth. He strode to the telephone.

"Miss Miller!" There was silence. Then he heard someone moving in the room.

"Sissy Miller speaking"—her voice at last answered him.

"Who," he thundered, "is B. M.?"

He could hear the cheap clock ticking on her mantelpiece; then a long drawn sigh. Then at last she said:

"He was my brother."

He was her brother; her brother who had killed himself.

"Is there," he heard Sissy Miller asking, "anything that I can explain?"

"Nothing!" he cried. "Nothing!"

He had received his legacy. She had told him the truth. She had stepped off the kerb to rejoin her lover. She had stepped off the kerb to escape from him.





The Searchlight


The mansion of the eighteenth century Earl had been changed in the twentieth century into a Club. And it was pleasant, after dining in the great room with the pillars and the chandeliers under a glare of light to go out on to the balcony overlooking the Park. The trees were in full leaf, and had there been a moon, one could have seen the pink and cream coloured cockades on the chestnut trees. But it was a moonless night; very warm, after a fine summer's day.

Mr. and Mrs. Ivimey's party were drinking coffee and smoking on the balcony. As if to relieve them from the need of talking, to entertain them without any effort on their part, rods of light wheeled across the sky. It was peace then; the air force was practising; searching for enemy aircraft in the sky. After pausing to prod some suspected spot, the light wheeled, like the wings of a windmill, or again like the antennae of some prodigious insect and revealed here a cadaverous stone front; here a chestnut tree with all its blossoms riding; and then suddenly the light struck straight at the balcony, and for a second a bright disc shone—perhaps it was a mirror in a lady's hand-bag.

"Look!" Mrs. Ivimey exclaimed.

The light passed. They were in darkness again

"You'll never guess what that made me see!" she added. Naturally, they guessed.

"No, no, no," she protested. Nobody could guess; only she knew; only she could know, because she was the great-grand-daughter of the man himself. He had told her the story. What story? If they liked, she would try to tell it. There was still time before the play.

"But where do I begin?" she pondered. "In the year 1820?... It must have been about then that my great-grandfather was a boy. "I'm not young myself "—no, but she was very well set up and handsome—"and he was a very old man when I was a child—when he told me the story. A very handsome old man," she explained, "with a shock of white hair, and blue eyes. He must have been a beautiful boy. But queer... . That was only natural—seeing how they lived. The name was Comber. They'd come down in the world. They'd been gentlefolk; they'd owned land up in Yorkshire. But when he was a boy only the tower was left. The house was nothing but a little farmhouse, standing in the middle of fields. We saw it ten years ago and went over it. We had to leave the car and walk across the fields. There isn't any road to the house. It stands all alone, the grass grows right up to the gate ... there were chickens pecking about, running in and out of the rooms. All gone to rack and ruin. I remember a stone fell from the tower suddenly." She paused. "There they lived," she went on, "the old man, the woman and the boy. She wasn't his wife, or the boy's mother. She was just a farm hand, a girl the old man had taken to live with him when his wife died. Another reason perhaps why nobody visited them—why the whole place was gone to rack and ruin. But I remember a coat of arms over the door; and books, old books, gone mouldy. He taught himself all he knew from books. He read and read, he told me, old books, books with maps hanging out from the pages. He dragged them up to the top of the tower—the rope's still there and the broken steps. There's a chair still in the window with the bottom fallen out; and the window swinging open, and the panes broken, and a view for miles and miles across the moors."

She paused as if she were up in the tower looking from the window that swung open.

"But we couldn't," she said, "find the telescope." In the diningroom behind them the clatter of plates grew louder. But Mrs. Ivimey, on the balcony, seemed puzzled, because she could not find the telescope.

"Why a telescope?" someone asked her.

"Why? Because if there hadn't been a telescope," she laughed, "I shouldn't be sitting here now."

And certainly she was sitting there now, a well set-up middle- aged woman, with something blue over her shoulders.

"It must have been there," she resumed, "because, he told me, every night when the old people had gone to bed he sat at the window, looking through the telescope at the stars. Jupiter, Aldebaran, Cassiopeia." She waved her hand at the stars that were beginning to show over the trees. It was growing darker. And the searchlight seemed brighter, sweeping across the sky, pausing here and there to stare at the stars.

"There they were," she went on, "the stars. And he asked himself, my great-grandfather—that boy: 'What are they? Why are they? And who am I?' as one does, sitting alone, with no one to talk to, looking at the stars."

She was silent. They all looked at the stars that were coming out in the darkness over the trees. The stars seemed very permanent, very unchanging. The roar of London sank away. A hundred years seemed nothing. They felt that the boy was looking at the stars with them. They seemed to be with him, in the tower, looking out over the moors at the stars.

Then a voice behind them said:

"Right you are. Friday."

They all turned, shifted, felt dropped down on to the balcony again.

"'Right you are—Friday—' Ah, but there was nobody to say that to him," she murmured. The couple rose and walked away.

"He was alone," she resumed. "It was a fine summer's day. A June day. One of those perfect summer days when everything seems to stand still in the heat. There were the chickens pecking in the farm- yard; the old horse stamping in the stable; the old man dozing over his glass. The woman scouring pails in the scullery. Perhaps a stone fell from the tower. It seemed as if the day would never end. And he had no one to talk to—nothing whatever to do. The whole world stretched before him. The moor rising and falling; the sky meeting the moor; green and blue, green and blue, for ever and ever."

In the half light, they could see that Mrs. Ivimey was leaning over the balcony, with her chin propped on her hands, as if she were looking out over the moors from the top of a tower.

"Nothing but moor and sky, moor and sky, for ever and ever," she murmured.

Then she made a movement, as if she swung something into position.

"But what did the earth look like through the telescope?" she asked.

She made another quick little movement with her fingers as if she were twirling something.

"He focussed it," she said. "He focussed it upon the earth. He focussed it upon a dark mass of wood upon the horizon. He focussed it so that he could see ... each tree ... each tree separate ... and the birds ... rising and falling ... and a stem of smoke ... there ... in the midst of the trees... . And then ... lower ... lower ... (she lowered her eyes) ... there was a house ... a house among the trees ... a farmhouse ... every brick showed ... and the tubs on either side of the door ... with flowers in them blue, pink, hydrangeas, perhaps...." She paused ... "And then a girl came out of the house ... wearing something blue upon her head ... and stood there ... feeding birds ... pigeons ... they came fluttering round her... . And then ... look ... A man. ... A man! He came round the corner. He seized her in his arms! They kissed ... they kissed."

Mrs. Ivimey opened her arms and closed them as if she were kissing someone.

"It was the first time he had seen a man kiss a woman—in his telescope—miles and miles away across the moors!"

She thrust something from her—the telescope presumably. She sat upright.

"So he ran down the stairs. He ran through the fields. He ran down lanes, out upon the high road, through woods. He ran for miles and miles, and just when the stars were showing above the trees he reached the house ... covered with dust, streaming with sweat... "

She stopped, as if she saw him.

"And then, and then ... what did he do then? What did he say? And the girl... " they pressed her.

A shaft of light fell upon Mrs. Ivimey as if someone had focussed the lens of a telescope upon her. (It was the air force, looking for enemy air craft.) She had risen. She had something blue on her head. She had raised her hand, as if she stood in a doorway, amazed.

"Oh the girl... . She was my—" she hesitated, as if she were about to say "myself." But she remembered; and corrected herself. "She was my great-grandmother," she said.

She turned to look for her cloak. It was on a chair behind her.

"But tell us—what about the other man, the man who came round the corner?" they asked.

"That man? That man," Mrs. Ivimey murmured, stooping to fumble with her cloak (the searchlight had left the balcony), "he, I suppose, vanished."

"The light," she added, gathering her things about her, "only falls here and there."

The searchlight had passed on. It was now focussed on the plain expanse of Buckingham Palace. And it was time they went on to the play.





The Lady in the Looking-Glass: A Reflection


People should not leave looking-glasses hanging in their rooms any more than they should leave open cheque books or letters confessing some hideous crime. One could not help looking, that summer afternoon, in the long glass that hung outside in the hall. Chance had so arranged it. From the depths of the sofa in the drawingroom one could see reflected in the Italian glass not only the marble- topped table opposite, but a stretch of the garden beyond. One could see a long grass path leading between banks of tall flowers until, slicing off an angle, the gold rim cut it off.

The house was empty, and one felt, since one was the only person in the drawing-room, like one of those naturalists who, covered with grass and leaves, lie watching the shyest animals—badgers, otters, kingfishers—moving about freely, themselves unseen. The room that afternoon was full of such shy creatures, lights and shadows, curtains blowing, petals falling—things that never happen, so it seems, if someone is looking. The quiet old country room with its rugs and stone chimney pieces, its sunken book-cases and red and gold lacquer cabinets, was full of such nocturnal creatures. They came pirouetting across the floor, stepping delicately with high-lifted feet and spread tails and pecking allusive beaks as if they had been cranes or flocks of elegant flamingoes whose pink was faded, or peacocks whose trains were veiled with silver. And there were obscure flushes and darkenings too, as if a cuttlefish had suddenly suffused the air with purple; and the room had its passions and rages and envies and sorrows coming over it and clouding it, like a human being. Nothing stayed the same for two seconds together.

But, outside, the looking-glass reflected the hall table, the sunflowers, the garden path so accurately and so fixedly that they seemed held there in their reality unescapably. It was a strange contrast—all changing here, all stillness there. One could not help looking from one to the other. Meanwhile, since all the doors and windows were open in the heat, there was a perpetual sighing and ceasing sound, the voice of the transient and the perishing, it seemed, coming and going like human breath, while in the looking-glass things had ceased to breathe and lay still in the trance of immortality.

Half an hour ago the mistress of the house, Isabella Tyson, had gone down the grass path in her thin summer dress, carrying a basket, and had vanished, sliced off by the gilt rim of the looking-glass. She had gone presumably into the lower garden to pick flowers; or as it seemed more natural to suppose, to pick something light and fantastic and leafy and trailing, travellers' joy, or one of those elegant sprays of convolvulus that twine round ugly walls and burst here and there into white and violet blossoms. She suggested the fantastic and the tremulous convolvulus rather than the upright aster, the starched zinnia, or her own burning roses alight like lamps on the straight posts of their rose trees. The comparison showed how very little, after all these years, one knew about her; for it is impossible that any woman of flesh and blood of fifty-five or sixty should be really a wreath or a tendril. Such comparisons are worse than idle and superficial—they are cruel even, for they come like the convolvulus itself trembling between one's eyes and the truth. There must be truth; there must be a wall. Yet it was strange that after knowing her all these years one could not say what the truth about Isabella was; one still made up phrases like this about convolvulus and travellers' joy. As for facts, it was a fact that she was a spinster; that she was rich; that she had bought this house and collected with her own hands—often in the most obscure corners of the world and at great risk from poisonous stings and Oriental diseases—the rugs, the chairs, the cabinets which now lived their nocturnal life before one's eyes. Sometimes it seemed as if they knew more about her than we, who sat on them, wrote at them, and trod on them so care fully, were allowed to know. In each of these cabinets were many little drawers, and each almost certainly held letters, tied with bows of ribbon, sprinkled with sticks of lavender or rose leaves. For it was another fact—if facts were what one wanted—that Isabella had known many people, had had many friends; and thus if one had the audacity to open a drawer and read her letters, one would find the traces of many agitations, of appointments to meet, of upbraidings for not having met, long letters of intimacy and affection, violent letters of jealousy and reproach, terrible final words of parting—for all those interviews and assignations had led to nothing—that is, she had never married, and yet, judging from the mask-like indifference of her face, she had gone through twenty times more of passion and experience than those whose loves are trumpeted forth for all the world to hear. Under the stress of thinking about Isabella, her room became more shadowy and symbolic; the corners seemed darker, the legs of chairs and tables more spindly and hieroglyphic.

Suddenly these reflections were ended violently and yet without a sound. A large black form loomed into the looking-glass; blotted out everything, strewed the table with a packet of marble tablets veined with pink and grey, and was gone. But the picture was entirely altered. For the moment it was unrecognizable and irrational and entirely out of focus. One could not relate these tablets to any human purpose. And then by degrees some logical process set to work on them and began ordering and arranging them and bringing them into the fold of common experience. One realized at last that they were merely letters. The man had brought the post.

There they lay on the marble-topped table, all dripping with light and colour at first and crude and unabsorbed. And then it was strange to see how they were drawn in and arranged and composed and made part of the picture and granted that stillness and immortality which the looking-glass conferred. They lay there invested with a new reality and significance and with a greater heaviness, too, as if it would have needed a chisel to dislodge them from the table. And, whether it was fancy or not, they seemed to have become not merely a handful of casual letters but to be tablets graven with eternal truth—if one could read them, one would know everything there was to be known about Isabella, yes, and about life, too. The pages inside those marblelooking envelopes must be cut deep and scored thick with meaning. Isabella would come in, and take them, one by one, very slowly, and open them, and read them carefully word by word, and then with a profound sigh of comprehension, as if she had seen to the bottom of everything, she would tear the envelopes to little bits and tie the letters together and lock the cabinet drawer in her determination to conceal what she did not wish to be known.

The thought served as a challenge. Isabella did not wish to be known—but she should no longer escape. It was absurd, it was monstrous. If she concealed so much and knew so much one must prise her open with the first tool that came to hand—the imagination. One must fix one's mind upon her at that very moment. One must fasten her down there. One must refuse to be put off any longer with sayings and doings such as the moment brought forth—with dinners and visits and polite conversations. One must put oneself in her shoes. If one took the phrase literally, it was easy to see the shoes in which she stood, down in the lower garden, at this moment. They were very narrow and long and fashionable—they were made of the softest and most flexible leather. Like everything she wore, they were exquisite. And she would be standing under the high hedge in the lower part of the garden, raising the scissors that were tied to her waist to cut some dead flower, some overgrown branch. The sun would beat down on her face, into her eyes; but no, at the critical moment a veil of cloud covered the sun, making the expression of her eyes doubtful—was it mocking or tender, brilliant or dull? One could only see the indeterminate outline of her rather faded, fine face looking at the sky. She was thinking, perhaps, that she must order a new net for the strawberries; that she must send flowers to Johnson's widow; that it was time she drove over to see the Hippesleys in their new house. Those were the things she talked about at dinner certainly. But one was tired of the things that she talked about at dinner. It was her profounder state of being that one wanted to catch and turn to words, the state that is to the mind what breathing is to the body, what one calls happiness or unhappiness. At the mention of those words it became obvious, surely, that she must be happy. She was rich; she was distinguished; she had many friends; she travelled— she bought rugs in Turkey and blue pots in Persia. Avenues of pleasure radiated this way and that from where she stood with her scissors raised to cut the trembling branches while the lacy clouds veiled her face.

Here with a quick movement of her scissors she snipped the spray of travellers' joy and it fell to the ground. As it fell, surely some light came in too, surely one could penetrate a little farther into her being. Her mind then was filled with tenderness and regret. ... To cut an overgrown branch saddened her because it had once lived, and life was dear to her. Yes, and at the same time the fall of the branch would suggest to her how she must die herself and all the futility and evanescence of things. And then again quickly catching this thought up, with her instant good sense, she thought life had treated her well; even if fall she must, it was to lie on the earth and moulder sweetly into the roots of violets. So she stood thinking. Without making any thought precise—for she was one of those reticent people whose minds hold their thoughts enmeshed in clouds of silence—she was filled with thoughts. Her mind was like her room, in which lights advanced and retreated, came pirouetting and stepping delicately, spread their tails, pecked their way; and then her whole being was suffused, like the room again, with a cloud of some profound knowledge, some unspoken regret, and then she was full of locked drawers, stuffed with letters, like her cabinets. To talk of "prising her open" as if she were an oyster, to use any but the finest and subtlest and most pliable tools upon her was impious and absurd. One must imagine—here was she in the looking-glass. It made one start.

She was so far off at first that one could not see her clearly. She came lingering and pausing, here straightening a rose, there lifting a pink to smell it, but she never stopped; and all the time she became larger and larger in the looking-glass, more and more completely the person into whose mind one had been trying to penetrate. One verified her by degrees—fitted the qualities one had discovered into this visible body. There were her grey-green dress, and her long shoes, her basket, and something sparkling at her throat. She came so gradually that she did not seem to derange the pattern in the glass, but only to bring in some new element which gently moved and altered the other objects as if asking them, courteously, to make room for her. And the letters and the table and the grass walk and the sunflowers which had been waiting in the looking-glass separated and opened out so that she might be received among them. At last there she was, in the hall. She stopped dead. She stood by the table. She stood perfectly still. At once the looking-glass began to pour over her a light that seemed to fix her; that seemed like some acid to bite off the unessential and superficial and to leave only the truth. It was an enthralling spectacle. Everything dropped from her—clouds, dress, basket, diamond—all that one had called the creeper and convolvulus. Here was the hard wall beneath. Here was the woman herself. She stood naked in that pitiless light. And there was nothing. Isabella was perfectly empty. She had no thoughts. She had no friends. She cared for nobody. As for her letters, they were all bills. Look, as she stood there, old and angular, veined and lined, with her high nose and her wrinkled neck, she did not even trouble to open them.

People should not leave looking-glasses hanging in their rooms.





The Shooting Party


She got in and put her suit case in the rack, and the brace of pheasants on top of it. Then she sat down in the corner. The train was rattling through the midlands, and the fog, which came in when she opened the door, seemed to enlarge the carriage and set the four travellers apart. Obviously M. M.—those were the initials on the suit case—had been staying the week-end with a shooting party. Obviously, for she was telling over the story now, lying back in her corner. She did not shut her eyes. But clearly she did not see the man opposite, nor the coloured photograph of York Minster. She must have heard, too, what they had been saying. For as she gazed, her lips moved; now and then she smiled. And she was, handsome; a cabbage rose; a russet apple; tawny; but scarred on the jaw—the scar lengthened when she smiled. Since she was telling over the story she must have been a guest there, and yet, dressed as she was, out of fashion as women dressed, years ago, in pictures in fashion plates of sporting newspapers, she did not seem exactly a guest, nor yet a maid. Had she had a basket with her she would have been the woman who breeds fox terriers; the owner of the Siamese cat; some one connected with hounds and horses. But she had only a suit case and the pheasants. Somehow therefore she must have wormed her way into the room that she was seeing through the stuffing of the carriage, and the man's bald head, and the picture of York Minster. And she must have listened to what they were saying, for now, like somebody imitating the noise that someone else makes, she made a little click at the back of her throat. "Chk. Chk." Then she smiled.

"Chk," said Miss Antonia, pinching her glasses on her nose. The damp leaves fell across the long windows of the gallery; one or two stuck, fish shaped, and lay like inlaid brown wood upon the window panes. Then the trees in the Park shivered, and the leaves, flaunting down, seemed to make the shiver visible—the damp brown shiver.

"Chk." Miss Antonia sniffed again, and pecked at the flimsy white stuff that she held in her hands, as a hen pecks nervously rapidly at a piece of white bread.

The wind sighed. The room was draughty. The doors did not fit, nor the windows. Now and then a ripple, like a reptile, ran under the carpet. On the carpet lay panels of green and yellow, where the sun rested, and then the sun moved and pointed a finger as if in mockery at a hole in the carpet and stopped. And then on it went, the sun's feeble but impartial finger, and lay upon the coat of arms over the fireplace— gently illumined the shield; the pendant grapes; the mermaid; and the spears. Miss Antonia looked up as the light strengthened. Vast lands, so they said, the old people had owned—her forefathers—the Rashleighs. Over there. Up the Amazons. Freebooter. Voyagers. Sacks of emeralds. Nosing round the island. Taking captives. Maidens. There she was, all scales from the tail to the waist. Miss Antonia grinned. Down struck the finger of the sun and her eye went with it. Now it rested on a silver frame; on a photograph; on an egg-shaped baldish head; on a lip that stuck out under the moustache; and the name "Edward" written with a flourish beneath.

"The King ..." Miss Antonia muttered, turning the film of white upon her knee, "had the Blue Room," she added with a toss of her head. The light faded.





Out in the King's Ride the pheasants were being driven across the noses of the guns. Up they spurted from the underwood like heavy rockets, reddish purple rockets, and as they rose the guns cracked in order, eagerly, sharply, as if a line of dogs had suddenly barked. Tufts of white smoke held together for a moment; then gently solved themselves, faded, and dispersed.

In the deep cut road beneath the hanger a cart stood, laid already with soft warm bodies, with limp claws, and still lustrous eyes. The birds seemed alive still, but swooning under their rich damp feathers. They looked relaxed and comfortable, stirring slightly, as if they slept upon a warm bank of soft feathers on the floor of the cart.

Then the Squire, with the hang-dog, purple-stained face, in the shabby gaiters, cursed and raised his gun.





Miss Antonia stitched on. Now and then a tongue of flame reached round the grey log that stretched from one bar to another across the grate, ate it greedily, then died out, leaving a white bracelet where the bark had been eaten off. Miss Antonia looked up for a moment, stared wide-eyed, instinctively, as a dog stares at a flame. Then the flame sank and she stitched again.

Then, silently, the enormously high door opened. Two lean men came in, and drew a table over the hole in the carpet. They went out; they came in. They laid a cloth upon the table. They went out; they came in. They brought a green baize basket of knives and forks; and glasses; and sugar casters; and salt-cellars; and bread; and a silver vase with three chrysanthemums in it. And the table was laid. Miss Antonia stitched on.

Again the door opened, pushed feebly this time. A little dog trotted in, a spaniel, nosing nimbly; it paused. The door stood open. And then, leaning on her stick, heavily, old Miss Rashleigh entered. A white shawl, diamond-fastened, clouded her baldness. She hobbled; crossed the room; hunched herself in the high-backed chair by the fireside. Miss Antonia went on stitching.

"Shooting," she said at last.

Old Miss Rashleigh nodded. "In the King's Ride," she said. She gripped her stick. They sat waiting.





The shooters had moved now from the King's Ride to the Home Woods. They stood in the purple ploughed field outside. Now and then a twig snapped; leaves came whirling. But above the mist and the smoke was an island of blue—faint blue, pure blue—alone in the sky. And in the innocent air, as if straying alone like a cherub, a bell from a far hidden steeple frolicked, gambolled, then faded. Then again up shot the rockets, the reddish purple pheasants. Up and up they went. Again the guns barked; the smoke balls formed; loosened, dispersed. And the busy little dogs ran nosing nimbly over the fields; and the warm damp bodies, still languid and soft, as if in a swoon, were bunched together by the men in gaiters and flung into the cart.

"There!" grunted Milly Masters, the house-keeper, throwing down her glasses. She was stitching, too, in the small dark room that overlooked the stable yard. The jersey, the rough woollen jersey, for her son, the boy who cleaned the Church, was finished. "The end 'o that!" she muttered. Then she heard the cart. Wheels ground on the cobbles. Up she got. With her hands to her hair, her chestnut-coloured hair, she stood in the yard, in the wind.

"Coming!" she laughed, and the scar on her cheek lengthened. She unbolted the door of the game room as Wing, the keeper, drove the cart over the cobbles. The birds were dead now, their claws gripped tight, though they gripped nothing. The leathery eyelids were creased greyly over their eyes. Mrs. Masters the housekeeper, Wing the gamekeeper, took bunches of dead birds by the neck and flung them down on the slate floor of the game larder. The slate floor became smeared and spotted with blood. The pheasants looked smaller now, as if their bodies had shrunk together. Then Wing lifted the tail of the cart and drove in the pins which secured it. The sides of the cart were stuck about with little grey-blue feathers, and the floor was smeared and stained with blood. But it was empty.

"The last of the lot!" Milly Masters grinned as the cart drove off.





"Luncheon is served, ma'am," said the butler. He pointed at the table; he directed the footman. The dish with the silver cover was placed precisely there where he pointed. They waited, the butler and the footman.

Miss Antonia laid her white film upon the basket; put away her silk; her thimble; stuck her needle through a piece of flannel; and hung her glasses on a hook upon her breast. Then she rose.

"Luncheon!" she barked in old Miss Rashleigh's ear. One second later old Miss Rashleigh stretched her leg out; gripped her stick; and rose too. Both old women advanced slowly to the table; and were tucked in by the butler and the footman, one at this end, one at that. Off came the silver cover. And there was the pheasant, featherless, gleaming; the thighs tightly pressed to its side; and little mounds of breadcrumbs were heaped at either end.

Miss Antonia drew the carving knife across the pheasant's breast firmly. She cut two slices and laid them on a plate. Deftly the footman whipped it from her, and old Miss Rashleigh raised her knife. Shots rang out in the wood under the window.

"Coming?" said old Miss Rashleigh, suspending her fork.

The branches flung and flaunted on the trees in the Park.

She took a mouthful of pheasant. Falling leaves flicked the window pane; one or two stuck to the glass.

"In the The Home Woods, now," said Miss Antonia. "Hugh's last shoot." She drew her knife down the other side of the breast. She added potatoes and gravy, Brussels sprouts and bread sauce methodically in a circle round the slices on her plate. The butler and the footman stood watching, like servers at a feast. The old ladies ate quietly; silently; nor did they hurry themselves; methodically they cleaned the bird. Bones only were left on their plates. Then the butler drew the decanter towards Miss Antonia, and paused for a moment with his head bent.

"Give it here, Griffiths," said Miss Antonia, and took the carcase in her fingers and tossed it to the spaniel beneath the table. The butler and the footman bowed and went out.

"Coming closer," said Miss Rashleigh, listening. The wind was rising. A brown shudder shook the air; leaves flew too fast to stick. The glass rattled in the windows.

"Birds wild," Miss Antonia nodded, watching the helter-skelter.





Old Miss Rashleigh filled her glass. As they sipped their eyes became lustrous like half-precious stones held to the light. Slate blue were Miss Rashleigh's; Miss Antonia's red, like port. And their laces and their flounces seemed to quiver, as if their bodies were warm and languid underneath their feathers as they drank.

"It was a day like this, d'you remember?" said old Miss Rashleigh, fingering her glass. "They brought him home ... a bullet through his heart. A bramble, so they said. Tripped. Caught his foot..." She chuckled as she sipped her wine.

"And John ..." said Miss Antonia. "The mare, they said, put her foot in a hole. Died in the field. The hunt rode over him. He came home, too, on a shutter ..." They sipped again.

"Remember Lily?" said old Miss Rashleigh. "A bad 'un." She shook her head. "Riding with a scarlet tassel on her cane ...."

"Rotten at the heart!" cried Miss Antonia. "Remember the Colonel's letter. 'Your son rode as if he had twenty devils in him— charged at the head of his men.'... Then one white devil—ah hah!" She sipped again.

"The men of our house ..." began Miss Rashleigh. She raised her glass. She held it high, as if she toasted the mermaid carved in plaster on the fireplace. She paused. The guns were barking. Something cracked in the woodwork. Or was it a rat running behind the plaster?

"Always women ..." Miss Antonia nodded. "The men of our house. Pink and white Lucy at the Mill—d'you remember?"

"Ellen's daughter at the Goat and Sickle," Miss Rashleigh added.

"And the girl at the tailor's," Miss Antonia murmured, "where Hugh bought his riding-breeches, the little dark shop on the right..."

"...that used to be flooded every winter. It's his boy," Miss Antonia chuckled, leaning towards her sister, "that cleans the church."

There was a crash. A slate had fallen down the chimney. The great log had snapped in two. Flakes of plaster fell from the shield above the fireplace.

"Falling," old Miss Rashleigh chuckled, "falling."





"And who," said Miss Antonia, looking at the flakes on the carpet, "who's to pay?"





Crowing like old babies, indifferent, reckless, they laughed; crossed to the fireplace, and sipped the sherry by the wood ashes and the plaster until each glass held only one drop of wine, reddish purple, at the bottom. And this the old women did not wish to part with so it seemed; for they fingered their glasses, as they sat side by side by the ashes; but they never raised them to their lips.

"Milly Masters in the still room," began old Miss Rashleigh. "She's our brother's ..."

A shot barked beneath the window. It cut the string that held the rain. Down it poured, down, down, down, in straight rods whipping the windows. Light faded from the carpet. Light faded in their eyes too, as they sat by the white ashes listening. Their eyes became like pebbles, taken from water; grey stones dulled and dried. And their hands gripped their hands like the claws of dead birds gripping nothing. And they shrivelled as if the bodies inside the clothes had shrunk. Then Miss Antonia raised her glass to the mermaid. It was the last drop; she drank it off. "Coming!" she croaked, and slapped the glass down. A door banged below. Then another. Then another. Feet could be heard trampling, yet shuffling, along the corridor towards the gallery.

"Closer! Closer!" grinned Miss Rashleigh, baring her three yellow teeth.

The immensely high door burst open. In rushed three great hounds and stood panting. Then there entered, slouching, the Squire himself in shabby gaiters. The dogs pressed round him, tossing their heads, snuffling at his pockets. Then they bounded forward. They smelt the meat. The floor of the gallery waved like a wind-lashed forest with the tails and backs of the great questing hounds. They snuffed the table. They pawed the cloth. Then with a wild neighing whimper they flung themselves upon the little yellow spaniel who was gnawing the carcass under the table.

"Curse you, curse you!" howled the Squire. But his voice was weak, as if he shouted against a wind. "Curse you, curse you!" he shouted, now cursing his sisters.

Miss Antonia and Miss Rashleigh rose to their feet. The great dogs had seized the spaniel. They worried him, they mauled him with their great yellow teeth. The Squire swung a leather knotted tawse this way, and that way, cursing the dogs, cursing his sisters, in the voice that sounded so loud yet so weak. With one lash he curled to the ground the vase of chrysanthemums. Another caught old Miss Rashleigh on the cheek. The old woman staggered backwards. She fell against the mantelpiece. Her stick, striking wildly, struck the shield above the fireplace. She fell with a thud upon the ashes. The shield of the Rashleighs crashed from the wall. Under the mermaid, under the spears, she lay buried.

The wind lashed the panes of glass; shots volleyed in the Park and a tree fell. And then King Edward in the silver frame slid, toppled and fell too.

The grey mist had thickened in the carriage. It hung down like a veil; it seemed to put the four travellers in the corners at a great distance from each other, though in fact they were as close as a third- class railway carriage could bring them. The effect was strange. The handsome, if elderly, the well-dressed, if rather shabby woman, who had got into the train at some station in the midlands seemed to have lost her shape. Her body had become all mist. Only her eyes gleamed, changed, lived all by themselves, it seemed; eyes without a body; eyes seeing something invisible. In the misty air they shone out, they moved, so that in the sepulchral atmosphere—the windows were blurred, the lamps haloed with fog—they were like lights dancing, will-o'-the-wisps that move, people say, over the graves of unquiet sleepers in churchyards. An absurd idea? Mere fancy! Yet after all, since there is nothing that does not leave some residue, and memory is a light that dances in the mind when the reality is buried, why should not the eyes there, gleaming, moving, be the ghost of a family, of an age, of a civilization dancing over the grave?

The train slowed down. One after another lamps stood up; held their yellow heads erect for a second; then were felled. Up they stood again as the train slid into the station. The lights blazed. And the eyes in the corner? They were shut. Perhaps the light was too strong. And of course in the full blaze of the station lamps it was plain—she was quite an ordinary rather elderly woman, travelling to London on some ordinary piece of business—something connected with a cat or a horse or a dog. She reached for her suit case, rose, and took the pheasants from the rack. But did she, all the same, as she opened the carriage door and stepped out, murmur "Chk. Chk." as she passed?





Kew Gardens


From the oval-shaped flower-bed there rose perhaps a hundred stalks spreading into heart-shaped or tongue-shaped leaves half way up and unfurling at the tip red or blue or yellow petals marked with spots of colour raised upon the surface; and from the red, blue or yellow gloom of the throat emerged a straight bar, rough with gold dust and slightly clubbed at the end. The petals were voluminous enough to be stirred by the summer breeze, and when they moved, the red, blue and yellow lights passed one over the other, staining an inch of the brown earth beneath with a spot of the most intricate colour. The light fell either upon the smooth grey back of a pebble, or the shell of a snail with its brown, circular veins, or, falling into a raindrop, it expanded with such intensity of red, blue and yellow the thin walls of water that one expected them to burst and disappear. Instead, the drop was left in a second silver grey once more, and the light now settled upon the flesh of a leaf, revealing the branching thread of fibre beneath the surface, and again it moved on and spread its illumination in the vast green spaces beneath the dome of the heart-shaped and tongue-shaped leaves. Then the breeze stirred rather more briskly overhead and the colour was flashed into the air above, into the eyes of the men and women who walk in Kew Gardens in July.

The figures of these men and women straggled past the flower-bed with a curiously irregular movement not unlike that of the white and blue butterflies who crossed the turf in zig-zag flights from bed to bed. The man was about six inches in front of the woman, strolling carelessly, while she bore on with greater purpose, only turning her head now and then to see that the children were not too far behind. The man kept this distance in front of the woman purposely, though perhaps unconsciously, for he wanted to go on with his thoughts.

"Fifteen years ago I came here with Lily," he thought. "We sat somewhere over there by a lake, and I begged her to marry me all through the hot afternoon. How the dragonfly kept circling round us: how clearly I see the dragon-fly and her shoe with the square silver buckle at the toe. All the time I spoke I saw her shoe and when it moved impatiently I knew without looking up what she was going to say: the whole of her seemed to be in her shoe. And my love, my desire, were in the dragon-fly; for some reason I thought that if it settled there, on that leaf, the broad one with the red flower in the middle of it, if the dragon-fly settled on the leaf she would say "Yes" at once. But the dragon-fly went round and round: it never settled anywhere—of course not, happily not, or I shouldn't be walking here with Eleanor and the children—Tell me, Eleanor, d'you ever think of the past?"

"Why do you ask, Simon?"

"Because I've been thinking of the past. I've been thinking of Lily, the woman I might have married ... Well, why are you silent? Do you mind my thinking of the past?"

"Why should I mind, Simon? Doesn't one always think of the past, in a garden with men and women lying under the trees? Aren't they one's past, all that remains of it, those men and women, those ghosts lying under the trees ... one's happiness, one's reality?"

"For me, a square silver shoe buckle and a dragon-fly—"

"For me, a kiss. Imagine six little girls sitting before their easels twenty years ago, down by the side of a lake, painting the water-lilies, the first red water-lilies I'd ever seen. And suddenly a kiss, there on the back of my neck. And my hand shook all the afternoon so that I couldn't paint. I took out my watch and marked the hour when I would allow myself to think of the kiss for five minutes only—it was so precious—the kiss of an old grey-haired woman with a wart on her nose, the mother of all my kisses all my life. Come, Caroline, come, Hubert."

They walked on the past the flower-bed, now walking four abreast, and soon diminished in size among the trees and looked half transparent as the sunlight and shade swam over their backs in large trembling irregular patches.

In the oval flower bed the snail, whose shelled had been stained red, blue, and yellow for the space of two minutes or so, now appeared to be moving very slightly in its shell, and next began to labour over the crumbs of loose earth which broke away and rolled down as it passed over them. It appeared to have a definite goal in front of it, differing in this respect from the singular high-stepping angular green insect who attempted to cross in front of it, and waited for a second with its antenna trembling as if in deliberation, and then stepped off as rapidly and strangely in the opposite direction. Brown cliffs with deep green lakes in the hollows, flat, blade-like trees that waved from root to tip, round boulders of grey stone, vast crumpled surfaces of a thin crackling texture—all these objects lay across the snail's progress between one stalk and another to his goal. Before he had decided whether to circumvent the arched tent of a dead leaf or to breast it there came past the bed the feet of other human beings.

This time they were both men. The younger of the two wore an expression of perhaps unnatural calm; he raised his eyes and fixed them very steadily in front of him while his companion spoke, and directly his companion had done speaking he looked on the ground again and sometimes opened his lips only after a long pause and sometimes did not open them at all. The elder man had a curiously uneven and shaky method of walking, jerking his hand forward and throwing up his head abruptly, rather in the manner of an impatient carriage horse tired of waiting outside a house; but in the man these gestures were irresolute and pointless. He talked almost incessantly; he smiled to himself and again began to talk, as if the smile had been an answer. He was talking about spirits—the spirits of the dead, who, according to him, were even now telling him all sorts of odd things about their experiences in Heaven.

"Heaven was known to the ancients as Thessaly, William, and now, with this war, the spirit matter is rolling between the hills like thunder." He paused, seemed to listen, smiled, jerked his head and continued:—

"You have a small electric battery and a piece of rubber to insulate the wire—isolate?—insulate?—well, we'll skip the details, no good going into details that wouldn't be understood—and in short the little machine stands in any convenient position by the head of the bed, we will say, on a neat mahogany stand. All arrangements being properly fixed by workmen under my direction, the widow applies her ear and summons the spirit by sign as agreed. Women! Widows! Women in black—"

Here he seemed to have caught sight of a woman's dress in the distance, which in the shade looked a purple black. He took off his hat, placed his hand upon his heart, and hurried towards her muttering and gesticulating feverishly. But William caught him by the sleeve and touched a flower with the tip of his walking-stick in order to divert the old man's attention. After looking at it for a moment in some confusion the old man bent his ear to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from it, for he began talking about the forests of Uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years ago in company with the most beautiful young woman in Europe. He could be heard murmuring about forests of Uruguay blanketed with the wax petals of tropical roses, nightingales, sea beaches, mermaids, and women drowned at sea, as he suffered himself to be moved on by William, upon whose face the look of stoical patience grew slowly deeper and deeper.

Following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled by his gestures came two elderly women of the lower middle class, one stout and ponderous, the other rosy cheeked and nimble. Like most people of their station they were frankly fascinated by any signs of eccentricity betokening a disordered brain, especially in the well- to-do; but they were too far off to be certain whether the gestures were merely eccentric or genuinely mad. After they had scrutinised the old man's back in silence for a moment and given each other a queer, sly look, they went on energetically piecing together their very complicated dialogue:

"Nell, Bert, Lot, Cess, Phil, Pa, he says, I says, she says, I says, I says, I says—"

"My Bert, Sis, Bill, Grandad, the old man, sugar,

Sugar, flour, kippers, greens,

Sugar, sugar, sugar."

The ponderous woman looked through the pattern of falling words at the flowers standing cool, firm, and upright in the earth, with a curious expression. She saw them as a sleeper waking from a heavy sleep sees a brass candlestick reflecting the light in an unfamiliar way, and closes his eyes and opens them, and seeing the brass candlestick again, finally starts broad awake and stares at the candlestick with all his powers. So the heavy woman came to a standstill opposite the oval-shaped flower bed, and ceased even to pretend to listen to what the other woman was saying. She stood there letting the words fall over her, swaying the top part of her body slowly backwards and forwards, looking at the flowers. Then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea.

The snail had now considered every possible method of reaching his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it. Let alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf, he was doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated with such an alarming crackle when touched even by the tip of his horns would bear his weight; and this determined him finally to creep beneath it, for there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground to admit him. He had just inserted his head in the opening and was taking stock of the high brown roof and was getting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the turf. This time they were both young, a young man and a young woman. They were both in the prime of youth, or even in that season which precedes the prime of youth, the season before the smooth pink folds of the flower have burst their gummy case, when the wings of the butterfly, though fully grown, are motionless in the sun.

"Lucky it isn't Friday," he observed.

"Why? D'you believe in luck?"

"They make you pay sixpence on Friday."

"What's sixpence anyway? Isn't it worth sixpence?"

"What's 'it'—what do you mean by 'it'?"

"O, anything—I mean—you know what I mean."

Long pauses came between each of these remarks; they were uttered in toneless and monotonous voices. The couple stood still on the edge of the flower bed, and together pressed the end of her parasol deep down into the soft earth. The action and the fact that his hand rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings in a strange way, as these short insignificant words also expressed something, words with short wings for their heavy body of meaning, inadequate to carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon the very common objects that surrounded them, and were to their inexperienced touch so massive; but who knows (so they thought as they pressed the parasol into the earth) what precipices aren't concealed in them, or what slopes of ice don't shine in the sun on the other side? Who knows? Who has ever seen this before? Even when she wondered what sort of tea they gave you at Kew, he felt that something loomed up behind her words, and stood vast and solid behind them; and the mist very slowly rose and uncovered—O, Heavens, what were those shapes?—little white tables, and waitresses who looked first at her and then at him; and there was a bill that he would pay with a real two shilling piece, and it was real, all real, he assured himself, fingering the coin in his pocket, real to everyone except to him and to her; even to him it began to seem real; and then—but it was too exciting to stand and think any longer, and he pulled the parasol out of the earth with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had tea with other people, like other people.

"Come along, Trissie; it's time we had our tea."

"Wherever does one have one's tea?" she asked with the oddest thrill of excitement in her voice, looking vaguely round and letting herself be drawn on down the grass path, trailing her parasol, turning her head this way and that way, forgetting her tea, wishing to go down there and then down there, remembering orchids and cranes among wild flowers, a Chinese pagoda and a crimson crested bird; but he bore her on.

Thus one couple after another with much the same irregular and aimless movement passed the flower-bed and were enveloped in layer after layer of green blue vapour, in which at first their bodies had substance and a dash of colour, but later both substance and colour dissolved in the green-blue atmosphere. How hot it was! So hot that even the thrush chose to hop, like a mechanical bird, in the shadow of the flowers, with long pauses between one movement and the next; instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies danced one above another, making with their white shifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun; and in the drone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul. Yellow and black, pink and snow white, shapes of all these colours, men, women, and children were spotted for a second upon the horizon, and then, seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass, they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees, dissolving like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere, staining it faintly with red and blue. It seemed as if all gross and heavy bodies had sunk down in the heat motionless and lay huddled upon the ground, but their voices went wavering from them as if they were flames lolling from the thick waxen bodies of candles. Voices. Yes, voices. Wordless voices, breaking the silence suddenly with such depth of contentment, such passion of desire, or, in the voices of children, such freshness of surprise; breaking the silence? But there was no silence; all the time the motor omnibuses were turning their wheels and changing their gear; like a vast nest of Chinese boxes all of wrought steel turning ceaselessly one within another the city murmured; on the top of which the voices cried aloud and the petals of myriads of flowers flashed their colours into the air.





The Journal of Mistress Joan Martyn


My readers may not know, perhaps, who I am. Therefore, although such a practice is unusual and unnatural—for we know how modest writers are—I will not hesitate to explain that I am Miss Rosamond Merridew, aged forty-five—my frankness is consistent!— and that I have won considerable fame among my profession for the researches I have made into the system of land tenure in mediaeval England. Berlin has heard my name; Frankfurt would give a soirée in my honour; and I am not absolutely unknown in one or two secluded rooms in Oxford and in Cambridge. Perhaps I shall put my case more cogently, human nature being what it is, if I state that I have exchanged a husband and a family and a house in which I may grow old for certain fragments of yellow parchment; which only a few people can read and still fewer would care to read if they could. But as a mother, so I read sometimes not without curiosity in the literature of my sex, cherishes most the ugliest and stupidest of her offspring, so a kind of maternal passion has sprung up in my breast for these shrivelled and colourless little gnomes; in real life I see them as cripples with fretful faces, but all the same, with the fire of genius in their eyes. I will not expound that sentence; it would be no more likely to succeed than if that same mother to whom I compare myself took pains to explain that her cripple was really a beautiful boy, more fair than all his brothers.

At any rate, my investigations have made a travelling pedlar of me; save that it is my habit to buy and not to sell. I present myself at old farm houses, decayed halls, parsonages, church vestries always with the same demand. Have you any old papers to show me? As you may imagine the palmy days for this kind of sport are over; age has become the most merchantable of qualities; and the state moreover with its Commissions has put an end for the most part to the enterprise of individuals. Some official, I am often told, has promised to come down and inspect their documents; and the favour of the "state" which such a promise carries with it, robs my poor private voice of all its persuasion.

Still it is not for me to complain, looking back as I can look back, upon some very tine prizes that will have been of real interest to the historian, and upon others that because they are so fitful and so minute in their illumination please me even better. A sudden light upon the legs of Dame Elizabeth Partridge sends its beams over the whole state of England, to the King upon his throne; she wanted stockings! And no other need impresses you in quite the same way with the reality of mediaeval legs; and therefore with the reality of mediaeval bodies, and so, proceeding upward step by step, with the reality of mediaeval brains; and there you stand at the centre of all ages: middle beginning or end. And this brings me to a further confession of my own virtues. My researches into the system of land tenure in the 13th[,] 14th and 15th Centuries have been made doubly valuable, I am assured, by the remarkable gift I have for presenting them in relation to the life of the time. I have borne in mind that the intricacies of the land tenure were not always the most important facts in the lives of men and women and children; I have often made so bold as to hint that the subtleties which delight us so keenly were more a proof of our ancestors' negligence than a proof of their astonishing painstaking. For what sane man, I have had the audacity to remark, could have spent his time in complicating his laws for the benefit of half a dozen antiquaries who were to be born five centuries after he was in the grave?

We will not here discuss this argument on whose behalf I have given and taken many shrewd blows; I introduce the question merely to explain why it is that I have made all these enquiries subsidiary to certain pictures of the family life which I have introduced into my text; as the flower of all these intricate roots; the flash of all this scraping of flint.

If you read my work called "The Manor Rolls" you will be pleased or disgusted according to your temperament by certain digressions which you will find there.

I have not scrupled to devote several pages of large print to an attempt to show, vividly as in a picture, some scene from the life of the time; here I knock at the serf's door, and find him roasting rabbits he has poached; I show you the Lord of the Manor setting out on some journey, or calling his dogs to him for a walk in the fields, or sitting in the high backed chair inscribing laborious figures upon a glossy sheet of parchment. In another room I show you Dame Elinor, at work with her needle; and by her on a lower stool sits her daughter stitching too, but less assiduously. "Child, thy husband will be here before thy house linen is ready," reproves the mother.

Ah, but to read this at large you must study my book! The critics have always threatened me with two rods; first, they say, such digressions are all very well in a history of the time, but they have nothing to do with the system [of] mediaeval land tenure; secondly, they complain that I have no materials at my side to stiffen these words into any semblance of the truth. It is well known that the period I have chosen is more bare than any other of private records; unless you choose to draw all your inspiration from the Paston Letters you must be content to imagine merely, like any other story teller. And that, I am told, is a useful art in its place; but it should be allowed to claim no relationship with the sterner art of the Historian. But here, again, I verge upon that famous argument which I carried on once with so much zeal in the Historian's Quarterly. We must make way with our introduction, or some wilful reader may throw down the book and profess to have mastered its contents already: O the old story! Antiquaries' Quarrels! Let me draw a line here then so—and put the whole of this question of right and wrong, truth and fiction behind me.

On a June morning two years ago, it chanced that I was driving along the Thetford road from Norwich to East Harling. I had been on some expedition, a wild goose chase it was, to recover some documents which I believed to lie buried in the ruins of Caister Abbey. If we were to spend a tithe of the sums that we spend yearly upon excavating Greek cities in excavating our own ruins what a different tale the Historian would have to tell!

Such was the theme of my meditations; but nevertheless one eye, my archaeological eye, kept itself awake to the landscape through which we passed. And it was in obedience to a telegram from this that I leapt up in the carriage, at a certain point and directed the driver to turn sharply to the left. We passed down a regular avenue of ancient elm trees; but the bait which drew me was a little square picture framed delicately between green boughs at the far end, in which an ancient doorway was drawn distinctly in lines of carved white stone.

As we approached[,] the doorway proved to be encircled by long low walls of buff coloured plaster; and on top of them, at no great distance was the roof of ruddy tiles, and finally I beheld in front of me the whole of the dignified little house, built like the letter E with the middle notch smoothed out of it.

Here was one of those humble little old Halls, then, which survive almost untouched, and practically unknown for centuries and centuries, because they are too insignificant to be pulled down or rebuilt; and their owners are too poor to be ambitious. And the descendants of the builder go on living here, with that curious unconsciousness that the house is in any way remarkable which serves to make them as much a part of it, as the tall chimney which has grown black with generations of kitchen smoke. Of course a larger house might be preferable, and I doubt not that they would hesitate to sell this old one, if a good offer were to be made for it. But that is the natural, and unself-conscious spirit which proves somehow how genuine the whole thing is. You cannot be sentimental about a house you have lived in for five hundred years. This is the kind of place, I thought, as I stood with my hand on the bell, where the owners are likely to possess exquisite manuscripts, and sell them as easily [to] the first rag man who comes along, as they would sell their pig wash, or the timber from the park. My point of view is that of a morbid eccentric, after all, and these are the people of truly healthy nature. Can't they write? they will tell me; and what is the worth of old letters? I always burn mine—or use them to tie over jampots.

A maid came, at last, staring meditatively at me, as though she ought to have remembered my face and my business. "Who lives here?" I asked her. "Mr Martyn," she gaped, as if I had asked the name of the reigning King of England. "Is there a Mrs Martyn, and is she at home, and might I see her?" The girl waved to me to follow, and led me in silence to a person who could, presumably, undertake the responsibility of answering my strange questions.

I was shown across a large hall, panelled with oak, to a smaller room in which a rosy woman of my own age was using a machine upon a pair of trousers. She looked like a housekeeper; but she was, the maid whispered, Mrs Martyn.

She rose with a gesture that indicated that she was not precisely a lady to receive morning calls, but was nevertheless the person of authority, the mistress of the house; who had a right to know my business in coming there.

There are certain rules in the game of the antiquary, of which the first and simplest is that you must not state your object at the first encounter. "I was passing by your door; and I took the liberty—I must tell you I am a great lover of the picturesque, to call, on the chance that I might be allowed to look over the house. It seems to me a particularly fine specimen."

"Do you want to rent it, may I ask," said Mrs Martyn, who spoke with a pleasant tinge of dialect.

"Do you let rooms then?" I questioned.

"O no," rejoined Mrs Martyn, decisively: "We never let rooms; I thought perhaps you wished to rent the whole house."

"It's a little big for me; but still, I have friends."

"As well, then," broke in Mrs Martyn, cheerfully, setting aside the notion of profit, and looking merely to do a charitable act; "I'm sure I should be very pleased to show you over the house—I don't know much about old things myself; and I never heard as the house was particular in any way. Still it's a pleasant kind of place—if you come from London." She looked curiously at my dress and figure, which I confess felt more than usually bent beneath her fresh, and somewhat compassionate gaze; and I gave her the information she wanted. Indeed as we strolled through the long passages, pleasantly striped with bars of oak across the white wash, and looked into spotless little rooms with square green windows opening on the garden, and where I saw furniture that was spare but decent, we exchange a considerable number of questions and answers. Her husband was a farmer on rather a large scale; but land had sunk terribly in value; and they were forces to live in the Hall now, which would not let; although it was far too large for them, and the rats were a nuisance. The Hall had been in her husband's family for many a year, she remarkable with some slight pride; she did not know how long, but people said the Martyns had once been great people in the neighbourhood. She drew my attention to the "y" in their name. Still she spoke with the very chastened and clear sighted pride of one who knows by hard personal experience how little nobility of birth avails, against certain material drawbacks, the poverty of the land, for instance, the holes in the roof, and the rapacity of rats.

Now although the place was scrupulously clean, and well kept there was a certain bareness in all the rooms, a prominence of huge oak tables, and an absence of other decorations than bright pewter cups and china plates which looked ominous to my inquisitive gaze. It seemed as though a great deal must have been sold, of those small portable things that make a room look furnished. But my hostess' dignity forbade me to suggest that her house had ever been other than it was at present. And yet I could not help fancying a kind of wistfulness in the way she showed me into rooms that were almost empty, compared the present poverty to days of greater affluence, and had it on the tip of her tongue to tell me that "Things had once been better." She seemed half apologetic, too, as she led me through a succession of sitting rooms if people had had leisure to sit there, as though she wished to show me that she was quite aware of the discrepancy between such a house and her ówn sturdy figure. All this being as it was, I did not like to ask the question that interested me most—whether they had any books? And I was beginning to feel that I had kept the good woman from her sewing machine long enough, when she suddenly looked out of the window, hearing a whistle below, and shouted something about coming in to dinner. Then she turned to me with some shyness, but an expression of hospitality, and begged me to "Sit down to dinner" with them. "John, my husband, knows a sight more than I do of these old things of his, and I know he's glad enough to find some one to talk to. It's in his blood, I tell him," she laughed, and I saw no good reason why I should not accept the invitation. Now John did not fall so easily beneath any recognized heading as his wife did. He was a man of middle age and middle size, dark of hair and complexion, with a pallor of skin that did not seem natural to a farmer; and a drooping moustache which he smoothed slowly with one well shaped hand as he spoke. His eye was hazel and bright, but I fancied a hint of suspicion when its glance rested upon me. He began to speak however, with even more of a Norfolk accent than his wife; and his voice, and dress asserted that he was, in truth if not altogether in appearance, a solid Norfolk farmer.

He nodded merely when I told him that his wife had had the kindness to show me his house. And then, looking at her with a twinkle in his eye he remarked, "If she had her way the old place would be left to the rats. The house is too big, and there are too many ghosts. Eh Betty." She merely smiled, as though her share of the argument had been done long ago.

I thought to please him by dwelling upon its beauties, and its age; but he seemed little interested by my praises, munched largely of cold beef, and added "ayes" and "noes" indifferently.

A picture, painted perhaps in the time of Charles the First, which hung above his head, had so much the look of him had his collar and tweed been exchanged for a ruff and a silk doublet, that I made the obvious comparison.

"O aye," he said, with no great show of interest, "that's my grandfather; or my grandfather's grandfather. We deal in grandfathers here."

"Was that the Martyn who fought at the Bogne," asked Betty negligently while she pressed me to take another slice of beef.

"At the Bogne," exclaimed her husband, with query and even irritation—"Why, my good woman, you're thinking of Uncle Jasper. This fellow was in his grave long before the Bogne. His name's Willoughby," he went on speaking to me, as though he wished me to understand the matter thoroughly; because a blunder about such a simple fact was unpardonable, even though the fact itself might not be of great interest.

"Willoughby Martyn: born 1625 died 1685: he fought at Marston Moor as Captain of a Troop of Norfolk men. We were always royalists. He was exiled in the Protectorate, went to Amsterdam; bought a bay horse off the Duke of Newcastle there; we have the breed still; he came back here at the Restoration, married Sally Hampton—of the Manor, but they died out last generation, and had six children, four sons and two daughters. He bought the Lower Meadow you know Betty," he jerked at his wife, to goad her unaccountably sluggish memory.

"I call him to mind well enough now," she answered, placidly.

"He lived here all the last part of his life; died of small pox, or what they called small pox then; and his daughter Joan caught it from him. They're buried in the same grave in the church yonder." He pointed his thumb, and went on with his dinner. All this was volunteered as shortly and even curtly as though he were performing some necessary task, which from long familiarity had become quite uninteresting to him; hough for some reason he had still to repeat it.

I could not help showing my interest in the story, although I was conscious that my questions did not entertain my host.

"You seem to have a queer liking for these old fathers of mine," he commented, at last, with an odd little scowl of humorous irritation. "You must show her the pictures after dinner, John," put in his wife; "and all the old things."

"I should be immensely interested," I said, "but I must not take up your time."

"O John knows a quantity about them; he's wonderful learned about pictures."

"Any fool knows his own ancestors, Betty;" growled her husband; "still, if you wish to see what we have, Madam, I shall be proud to show you." The courtesy of the phrase, and the air with which he held the door open for me, made me remember the "y" in his name.

He showed me round the Hall, pointing with a riding crop to one dark canvas after another; and rapping out two or three unhesitating words of description at each, they were hung apparently in chronological order, and it was clear in spite of the dirt and the dark that the later portraits were feebler examples of the art, and represented less distinguished looking heads. Military coats became less and less frequent, and in the 18th century the male Martyns were represented [in] snuff coloured garments of a homely cut, and were briefly described as "Farmers" or "him who sold the Fen Farm" by their descendant. Their wives and daughters at length dropped out altogether, as though in time a portrait had come to be looked upon more as the necessary appendage of the head of the house, rather than as the right which beauty by itself could claim.

Still, I could trace no sign in the man's voice that he was following the decline of his family with his riding crop, for there was neither pride nor regret in his tone; indeed it kept its level note, as of one who tells a tale so well known that the words have been rubbed smooth of meaning.

"There's the last of them—my father," he said at length, when he had slowly traversed the four sides of the Hall; I looked upon a crude canvas, painted in the early sixties I gathered, by some travelling painter with a literal brush. Perhaps the unskillful hand had brought out the roughness of the features and the harshness of the complexion; had found it easier to paint the farmer than to produce the subtle balance which, one might gather, blent in the father as in the son. The artist had stuffed his sitter into a black coat, and wound a stiff white tie round his neck; the poor gentleman had never felt at ease in them,yet.

"And now, Mr Martyn," I felt bound to say, "I can only thank you, and your wife for ..."

"Stop a moment," he interrupted, "we're not done yet. There are the books."

His voice had a half comic doggedness about it; like one who is determined, in spite of his own indifference to the undertaking, to make a thorough job of it.

He opened a door and bade me enter a small room, or rather office; for the table heaped with papers, and the walls lined with ledgers, suggested the room where business is transacted by the master of an estate. There were pads and brushes for ornament; and there were mostly dead animals, raising lifeless paws, and grinning, with plaster tongues, from various brackets and cases.

"These go back beyond the pictures;" he said, as he stooped and lifted a great parcel of yellow papers with an effort. They were not bound, or kept together in any way, save by a thick cord of green silk, with bars at either end; such as you use to transfix bundles of greasy documents—butcher's bills, and the year's receipts. "That's the first lot," he said ruffling the leaves with his fingers, like a pack of cards; "that's no. Ⅰ:1480 to 1500." I gasped, as anyone may judge: but the temperate voice of Martyn reminded me that enthusiasm was out of place, here; indeed enthusiasm began to look like a very cheap article when contrasted with the genuine thing.

"Ah indeed; that's very interesting; may I look?" was all I said, though my undisciplined hand shook a little when the bundle was carelessly dropped into it. Mr Martyn indeed offered to fetch a duster before desecrating my white skin; but I assured him it was of no consequence, too eagerly perhaps, because I had feared that there might be some more substantial reason why I should not hold these precious papers.

While he bent down before a book case, I hastily looked at the first inscription on the parchment. "The Journal of Mistress Joan Martyn," I spelt out, "kept by her at Martyn's Hall, in the county of Norfolk the year of our Lord 1480."

"My grandmother Joan's diary," interrupted Martyn, turning round with his arm full of books. "Queer old lady she must have been. I could never keep a diary myself. Never kept one beyond the 10th of February, though I tried often. But here you see," he leant over me, turning the pages, and pointing with his finger, "here is January, February, March, April—so on—a whole twelve months."

"Have you read it, then?" I asked, expecting, nay, hoping that he would say no.

"O yes, I've read it;" he remarked casually, as though that were but a simple undertaking. "It took me some time to get used to the writing, and the old girl's spelling is odd. But there are some queer things in it. I learnt a deal about the land from her, one way and another." He tapped it meditatively.

"Do you know her history too?" I asked.

"Joan Martyn," he began in the voice of a showman, "was born 1495. She was the daughter of Giles Martyn. She was his only daughter. He had three sons though; we always have sons. She wrote this diary when she was twenty-five. She lived here all her life—never married. Indeed she died at the age of thirty. I daresay you might see her tomb down there with the rest of them."

"Now this," he said touching a thick book bound in parchment, "is more interesting to my mind. This is the household book of Jasper for the year 1583. See how the old gentleman kept his accounts; what they eat and drank; how much meat and bread and wine cost; how many servants he kept—his horses, carriages, beds, furniture, everything. There's method for you. I have a set of ten of them." He spoke of them with greater pride than I had heard him speak of any of his possessions yet.

"This one too makes good reading of a winter's night," he went on, "This is the Stud book of Willoughby; you remember Willoughby."

"The one who bought the horse of the Duke, and died of small pox," I repeated glibly.

"That's so," he nodded. "Now this is really fine stuff this one." He went on, like a connoisseur, talking of some favourite brand of port. "I wouldn't sell this for £20. Here are names, the pedigrees, the lives, values, descendants; all written out like a bible." He rolled some of the strange old names of these dead horses upon his tongue, as though he relished the sound like wine. "Ask my wife if I can't tell 'em all without the book," he laughed, shutting it carefully and placing it on the shelf.

"These are the Estate books; they go down to this year; there's the last of 'em. Here's our family history." He unrolled a long strip of parchment, upon with which an elaborate genealogical tree had been inscribed, with many faded flourishes and extravagances of some mediaeval pen. The boughs spread so widely by degrees, that they were lopped unmercifully by the limits of the sheet—a husband depending, for instance, with a family of ten children and no wife. Fresh ink at the base of all recorded the names of Jasper Martyn, my host, and his wife Elizabeth Clay: they had three sons. His finger travelled sagaciously down the tree, as though it were so well used to this occupation that it could almost be trusted to perform it by itself. Martyn's voice murmured on as though it repeated a list of Saints or Virtues in some monotonous prayer.

"Yes," he concluded, rolling up the sheet and laying it by, "I think I like those two best. I could say them through with my eyes shut. Horses or Grandfathers!"

"Do you study here a great deal then?" I asked, somewhat puzzled by this strange man.

"I've no time for study," he returned, rather roughly, as tho' the farmer cropped up in him at my question. "I like to read something easy in the winter nights; and in the morning too, if I wake early. I keep them by my bed sometimes. I say them to send myself to sleep. It's easy to know the names of one's own family. They come natural. But I was never any good at book learning, more's the pity."

Asking my permission, he lit a pipe and began puffing forth great curls of smoke, as he ranged the volume in order before him. But I kept No. One, the bundle of parchment sheets, in my hand, nor did he seem to miss it from the rest.

"You would be sorry to part with any of these, I daresay?" I hazarded, at last, covering my real eagerness with an attempt at a laugh.

"Part with them?" he returned, "what should I part with them for?'the idea was evidently so remote that my question had not, as I feared, irritated his suspicions.

"No, no," he went on, "I find them far too useful for that. Why, Madam, these old papers have stood out for my rights in a court of law before now; besides, a man likes to keep his family round him; I should feel—well kind of lonely if you take my meaning, without my Grandfathers and Grandmothers, and Uncles and Aunts." He spoke as though he confessed a weakness.

"O," I said, "I quite understand—"

"I daresay you have the same feeling yourself Madam and down here, in a lonely place like this, company means more than you could well believe. I often think I shouldn't know how to pass the time, if it weren't for my relations."

No words of mine, or attempts at a report of his words, can give the curious impression which he produced as he spoke, that all these "relations" Grandfathers of the time of Elizabeth, nay Grandmothers of the time of Edward the Fourth, were just, so to speak, brooding round the corner; there was none of the pride of "ancestry" in his voice but merely the personal affection of a son for his parents. All generations seemed bathed in his mind in the same clear and equable light: it was not precisely the light of the present day, but it certainly was not what we commonly call the light of the past. And it was not romantic, it was very sober, and very broad and the figures stood out in it, solid and capable, with a great resemblance, I suspect, to what they were in the flesh.

It really needed no stretch of the imagination to perceive that Jasper Martyn might come in from his farm and his fields, and sit down here alone to a comfortable gossip with his "relations;" whenever he chose; and that their voices were very nearly as audible to him as those of the labourers in the field below, which came floating in, upon the level afternoon sunlight through the open window.

But my original intention of asking whether he would sell, almost made me blush when I remembered it now: so irrelevant and so impertinent. And also, strange though it may seem, I had lost for the time my proper antiquarian zeal; all my zest for old things, and the little distinguishing marks of age, left me, because they seemed the trivial and quite immaterial accidents of large substantial things. There was really no scope for antiquarian ingenuity m the case of Mr Martyn's ancestors, anymore than it needed an antiquary to expound the history of the man himself.

They are, he would have told me, all flesh and blood like I am; and the fact that they have been dead for four or five centuries makes no more difference to them, than the glass you place over a canvas changes the picture beneath it.

But on the other hand, if it seemed impertinent to buy, it seemed natural, if perhaps a little simpleminded, to borrow.

"Well, Mr Martyn," I said at length, with less eagerness and less trepidation than I could have thought possible under the circum-stances, "I am thinking of staying for a week or so in this neighbourhood—at the Swan at Gartham indeed—I should be much obliged to you if you would lend me these papers to look through during my stay. This is my card. Mr Lathom, (the great landowner of the place) will tell you all about me." Instinct told me that Mr Martyn was not the man to trust the benevolent impulses of his heart.

"O Madam, there's no need to bother about that," he said, carelessly, as though my request were not of sufficient importance to need his scrutiny. "If these old papers please you, I'm sure you're welcome to 'em." He seemed a little surprised, however, so that I added, "I take a great interest in family histories, even when they're not my own."

"It's amusing eno', I daresay, if you have the time," he assented politely; but I think his opinion of my intelligence was lowered.

"Which would you like," he asked, stretching his hand towards the Household Books of Jasper; and the Stud book of Willoughby.

"Well I think I'll begin with your grandmother Joan," I said; "I like beginning at the beginning."

"O very well," he smiled; "though I don't think you'll find anything out of the way in her; she was very much the same as the rest of us—as far as I can see, not remarkable—"

But all the same, I walked off with Grandmother Joan beneath my arm; Betty insisted upon wrapping her in brown paper, to disguise the queer nature of the package, for I refused to let them send it over as they wished, by the boy who took the letters on his bicycle.





I


The state of the times, which my mother tells me, is less safe and less happy than when she was a girl, makes it necessary for us to keep much within our own lands. After dark indeed, and the sun sets terribly soon in January, we have to be safe behind the hall Gates; my mother goes out as soon as the dark makes her embroidery too dim to see, with the great keys on her arm. "Is everybody within doors?" she cries, and swings the bells out upon the road, in case any of our men may still be working in the field. Then she draws the Gates close, clamps them with the lock, and the whole world is barred away from us. I am very bold and impatient sometimes, when the moon rises, over a land gleaming with frost; and I think I feel the pressure of all this free and beautiful place—all England and the sea, and the land beyond—rolling like sea waves, against our iron gates, breaking, and withdrawing—and breaking again—all through the long black night. Once I leapt from my bed, and ran to my mother's room, crying, "Let them in. Let them in! We are starving!" "Are the soldiers there, child," she cried: "or is it your father's voice?" she ran to the window, and together we gazed out upon the silver fields, and all was peaceful. But I could not explain what it was that I heard; and she bade me sleep, and be thankful that there were stout gates between me and the world.

But on other nights, when the wind is wild and the moon is sunk beneath hurrying clouds, I am glad to draw close to the fire, and to think that all those bad men who prowl in the lanes, and lie hidden in the woods at this hour cannot break through our great Gates, try as they will. Last night was such a night; they come often in Winter when my father is away in London, my brothers are with the army, save my little brother Jeremy, and my mother has to manage the farm, and order the people, and see that all our rights are looked to. We may not burn the tapers after the church bell has struck 8 times, and so we sit round the logs, with the priest, John Sandys, and one or two of the servants sleep with us in the Hall. Then my mother, who cannot be idle even by fire light, winds her wool for her knitting, sitting in the great chair which stands by the cheek of the hearth. When her wool gets tangled she strikes a great blow with the iron rod, and sends the flames and the sparks spurting in showers; she stoops her head into the tawny light, and you see what a noble woman she is; in spite of age—she is more than forty—and the hard lines which much thought and watching have cut in her brow. She wears a fine linen cap, close fitting to the shape of her head, and her eyes are deep and stern, and her cheek is coloured like a healthy winter apple. It is a great thing to be the daughter of such a woman, and to hope that one day the same power may be mine. She rules us all.

Sir John Sandys, the priest, is, for all his sacred office, the servant of my mother; and does her will simply and querulously, and is never so happy as when she asks him for advice, and takes her own. But she would scold me well if I ever whispered such a thing: for she is the faithful daughter of the Church, and reverence her Priest. Again there are William and Anne, the servant who sit with us, because they are so old that my mother wishes them to share our fire. But William is so ancient, so curved with planting and digging, so bruised and battered by the sun and the wind that one might as well ask the pollard willow in the fen to share one's fire, or join one's talk. Still, his memory goes back a great way, and if he could tell us, as he sometimes tries to begin, of the things he has seen in his day, it would be curious to hear. Old Anne was my mother's nurse; she was mine; and still she mends our clothes, and knows more about household things than any, save my mother. She will tell you, too, the history of each chair and table or piece of tapestry in the house; but most of all she likes to discuss with mother and Sir John the men whom it would be most suitable for me to marry.

As long as the light serves it is my duty to read aloud—because I am the only one who can read though my mother can write, and spell words beyond the fashion of her time, and my father has sent me a manuscript from London; called The Palace of Glass, by Mr John Lydgate. It is a poem, written about Helen and the Siege of Troy.

Last night I read of Helen, and her beauty and her suitors, and the fair town of Troy and they listened silently; for though we none of us know where those places are, we see very well what they must have been like; and we can weep for the sufferings of the soldiers, and picture to ourselves the stately woman herself, who must have been, I think, something like my mother. My mother beats with her foot and sees the whole processions pass I know, from the way her eyes gleam, and her head tosses. "It must have been in Cornwall," said Sir John, "where King Arthur lived with his knights. I remember stories I could tell you of all their doings, but my memory is dim."

"Ah but there are fine stories of the Northmen, too," broke in Anne; whose mother was from those parts; "but I have sung them often to my Mister, and to you too Miss Joan."

"Read on Joan, while there is light," commanded my mother. Indeed, of all I think she listened closest, and was most vexed when the Curfew tolled from the Church nearby. Yet she called herself an old fool for listening to stories, when the account had still to be made up for my father in London.

When the light is out and I can no longer see to read, they begin talking of the state of the country; and telling dreadful stories of the plots and the battles and the bloody deeds that are going on all round us. But for all I can see, we are not worse now than we have always been; and we in Norfolk today are much the same as we were in the days of Helen, wherever she may have lived. Was not Jane Moryson carried off on the eve of her wedding only last year?

But anyhow, the story of Helen is old; my mother says it happened, long before her day; and these robbings and burnings are going on now. So the talk makes me, and Jeremy too, tremble and think that every rattle of the big door, is the battering ram of some wandering highwayman.

It is far worse tho', when the time for bed comes, and the fire sinks, and we have to feel our way up the great stairs, and along the passages, where the windows shine grey, and so into our cold bed rooms. The window in my room is broken, and stuffed with straw, but gusts come in and lift the tapestry on the wall, till I think that horses and men in armour are charging down upon me. My prayer last night was, that the great gates might hold fast, and all robbers and murderers might pass us by.





Ⅱ


The dawn, even when it is cold and melancholy, never fails to shoot through my limbs as with arrows of sparkling piercing ice. I pull aside the thick curtains, and search for the first glow in the sky which shows that life is breaking through. And with my cheek leant upon the window pane I like to fancy that I am pressing as closely as can be upon the massy wall of time, which is for ever lifting and pulling and letting fresh spaces of life in upon us. May it be mine to taste the moment before it has spread itself over the rest of the world! Let me taste the newest and the freshest. From my window I look down upon the Church yard, where so many of my ancestors are buried, and in my prayer I pity those poor dead men who toss perpetually on the old recurring waters; for I see them, circling and eddying forever upon a pale tide, Let us, then, who have the gift of the present, use it and enjoy it: That I confess, is part of my morning prayer.

It rained steadily today, so that I had to spend the morning with my sewing. My mother was writing her letter to my father which John Ashe will take with him to London next week. My thoughts naturally dwelt upon this journey, and upon the great city which perhaps I may never see, though I am for ever dreaming of it. You start at dawn; for it is well to spend few nights on the road. John travels with three other men, bound to the same place; and I have often seen them set forth, and longed to ride with them. They gather in the courtyard, while the stars are still in the sky; and the people of the neighbourhood come out wrapped in cloaks and strange garments, and my mother carries out a tankard of strong Ale to each traveler; and gives it to him from her own hand. Their horses are laden with packs before and behind, but not so as to hinder them from starting out in a gallop if need be; and the men are well armed, and closely dressed in fur lined habits, for the winter days are short and cold, and maybe they will sleep beneath a hedge. It is a gallant sight in the dawn, for the horses champ and fret to be gone; the people cluster round. They wish their God speeds and their last messages to friends in London; and as the dock strikes four they wheel about, salute my mother and the rest, and turn sharply on their road. Many young men and women too, follow them some paces on the way till the mist comes between, for often men who set forth thus in the dawn, never ride home again.

I picture them riding all day along the white roads, and I see them dismount at the shrine of our Lady and do homage, pray [to] her for a safe journey. There is but one road, and it passes through vast lands, where no men live, but only those who have murdered or robbed; fort hey may not dwell with others in towns, but must pass their lives with the wild beasts, who murder also, and eat the clothes from your back. It is a fearful ride; but, truly, I think I should like to go that way once, and pass over the land, like a ship at sea.

At midday they reach an Inn—for there are Inns at all the stages upon the journey to London, where a traveller may rest in safety. The landlord will tell you the state of the road, and he will ask you of your adventures, so that he may give warning to others who travel the same way. But you must press on, to reach your sleeping place before the dark lets loose all those fierce creatures, who have lain hidden in the day. John has often told me how as the sun comes from the sky silence falls on the company, and each man has his gun swung beneath his hand, and even the horses prick their ears and need no urging. Your each the crest of the road, and look fearfully beneath you, lest something moves in the shade of the fir trees by the wayside. And then Robin, the cheerful Miller, shouts a snatch of a song, and they take heart, and step bravely down the hill, talking lest the deep breath of the wind, as of a woman who sighs deeply, may cast a panic into their hearts. Then some one rises in his stirrup and sees the spark of a lodging far off on the rim of the land. And if Our Lady is merciful to them they reach this in safety when we at home are on our knees in prayer for them.

My mother called me from my book this morning to talk with her in her room. I found her in the little chamber where my father is wont to sit, when he is at home, with the Manor Rolls and other legal papers before him. It is here that she sits when she has duty to do as the head of the household. I curtseyed deeply; thinking that I guessed already why she had sent for me.

She had a sheet spread before her, covered with close writing. She bade me read it; and then before I had taken the paper in my hand she cried, "No—I will tell you myself."

"Daughter," she began, solemnly, "it is high time that you were married. Indeed it is only the troubled state of the land"—she sighed— "and our own perplexities, that have delayed the matter so long."

"Do you think much of marriage?" she looked at me half smiling.

"I have no wish to leave you," I said.

"Come, my child you speak like a Babe," she laughed, though I think she was well pleased at my affection.

"And besides, if you married as I would have you marry"—she tapped the paper—"you would not go far from me. You might for instance rule over the land of Kirflings—your land would touch ours—You would be our good neighbour. The Lord of Kirflings is Sir Amyas Bigod, a man of ancient name."

"I think it is a suitable match; such as a mother might wish for her daughter," she mused, always with the sheet before her.

As I have only seen Sir Amyas once, when he came home with my father from the sessions at Norwich, and as on that occasion my only speech with him was to invite him gravely to drink the sack which I proffered, curtseying, I could not pretend to add anything to what my mother said. All I knew was that he had a fair, straight face; and if his hair was gray, it was not so gray as my father's, and his land bordered ours so that we might well live happily together.

"Marriage, you must know my daughter," went on my mother, "is a great honour and a great burden. If you marry such a man as Sir Amyas you become not only the head of his household, and that is much, but the head of his race for ever and ever, and that is more. We will not talk of love—as that song writer of yours talks of love, as a passion and afire and a madness."

"O he is only a story teller, Mother," I chimed in—

"And such things are not to be found in real life; at least I think not often." My mother was used to consider gravely as she spoke.

"But that is beside the question. Here, my daughter," and she spread the paper before her, "is a writing from Sir Amyas, to your father; he asks for your hand, and wishes to know whether there are other treaties for you and what dowry we will give with you. He tells us what he will provide on his part. Now I give you this paper to read by yourself; that you may consider whether this exchange seems to you a fair one."

I knew already what lands and monies I had as my portion; and I knew that as the only daughter of my father my dowry was no mean one.

So that I might continue in this country which I love, and might live on close to my mother, I would take less than my fight both of wealth and of land. But the gravity of the compact is such that I felt as though several years were added to my age, when my mother handed me the roll of paper. Since I was a child, I have always heard my parents talk of my marriage; and during the last two or three years there have been several contracts almost made I know, that came nothing in the end. I lose my youth however, and it is high time that a bargain were struck.

I thought, naturally, for a long time, until the dinner bell rung indeed at midday, of the general honour and burden, as my mother calls it, of marriage. No other event in the life of a woman can mean so great a change; for from flitting shadow like and unconsidered in her father's house, marriage suddenly forms her to a substantial body, with weight which people must see and make way for. That is of course, if her marriage is suitable. And so, every maiden waits this change with wonder and anxiety; for it will prove whether she is to be [an] honourable and authoritative woman for ever, like my mother; or it will show that she is of no weight or worth. Either in this world or in the next.

And if I marry well, the burden of a great name and of great lands will be on me; many servants will call me mistress; I shall be the mother of sons; in my husband's absence I shall rule his people, taking care for herds and crops and keeping watch on his enemies; within doors I shall store up fine lines and my chests shall be laden with spices and preserves; by the work of my needle all waste of time and use will be repaired and renewed so that at my death my daughter shall find her cupboards better lined with fine raiments than when I found them. And when I lie dead, the people from the countryside shall pass for three days before my body, praying and speaking good of me, and at the will of my children the priest shall say mass for my soul and candles shall burn in the church for ever and ever.





Ⅳ


I was stopped in the midst of such reflections firstly by the dinner bell; and you must not be late, or you interfere with Sir John's grace and that means no pudding; and then, when I might have put myself more into the position of a married woman, Jeremy my brother, insisted that we should go for a walk with Anthony, my father's chief steward—after my mother that is.

He is a crass man, but I like him because he is a faithful servant, and knows as much about land and sheep as any man in Norfolk. It was heal so who broke Lancelot's head in last Michaelmas for using bad language [to] my mother. He is for ever tramping our fields, and knows them better and loves them more, so I tell him, than any human creature. He is wedded to this clump of earth, and sees in it a thousand beauties and gifts such as ordinary men see in their wives. And, as we have trotted by his side since we could walk alone, some of his affection has become ours too; Norfolk and the parish of Long Winton in Norfolk is to me what my own grandmother is; a tender parent, dear and familiar, and silent to whom I shall return in time. O how blessed it would be marry, or grow old; but to spend one's life innocently and indifferently among the trees and rivers which alone can keep one cool and childlike in the midst of the trouble of the world! Marriage or any other great joy would confuse the clear vision which is still mine. And at the thought of losing that, I cried in my heart," No, I will never leave you—for a husband or a lover," and straightway I started chasing rabbits across the heath with Jeremy and the dogs.

It was a cold afternoon, but a bright one; as though the sun were made of gleaming ice and not of fire; and its rays were long icicles that reached from sky to earth. They splintered on our cheeks, and went glancing across the fen. And the whole country seemed empty, save of a few swift rabbits, but very chaste and very glad in its solitude. We ran to keep warm, and chattered when the blood raced sparkling through our limbs. Anthony stalked straight on, as though his stride were the best thing in the world against the cold. Certainly when we came to a broken hedge, or a snare stretched for a rabbit, he took off his gloves and leant on his knee and took note of it as though it were a midsummer day. Once we came upon a strange man, slouching along the road, in rusty green, with the look of one who knows not which way to take. Anthony held my hand firmly; this was a Sanctuary man he said, prowling out of bounds in search of food. He had robbed or murdered, or perchance he was only a debtor. Jeremy swore he saw blood on his hands: but Jeremy is a boy, and would like to defend us all with his bow and arrows.

Anthony had some business at one of the cottages, and we came in with him out of the cold. But indeed, I could hardly stand the heat and the smell. Beatrice Somers, and her husband Peter live here, and they have children; but it was more like the burrow of some rabbit on the heath than the house of a man. Their roof was of brush, and straw, their floor was but the earth trodden bare of grass or flower; sticks burnt in the comer, and sent the smoke stinging into our eyes. There was but a rotten log on which a woman sat, nursing a baby. She looked at us, not with fright, but with distrust and dislike written clear in her eyes; and she clasped her child more closely. Anthony spoke to her as he would have spoken to some animal who had strong claws and a wicked eye: he stood over her, and his great boot seemed ready to crush her. But she did not move or speak; and I doubt whether she could have spoken, or whether snarling and howling was her only language.

Outside we met Peter coming home from the fen, and tho' he touched his forehead to us, he seemed to have no more human sense in him than his wife. He looked at us, and seemed fascinated by a coloured cloak which I wore; and then he stumbled into his burrow, to lie on the ground I suppose, rolled in dried bracken till morning. These are the people we must rule; and tread under foot, and scourge them to do the only work they are fitted to do; as they will tear us to pieces with their fangs. Thus Anthony spoke as he took us away, and then clenched his fists and set his lips as though he were razing to the earth some such poor wretch already. Still the sight of that ugly face spoilt the rest of the walk; since it seemed that even my dear country bred pests like these. Is aw such eyes staring at me from the furze bushes, and the tangles of the undergrowth.

It was like waking from a nightmare to enter our own clean hall, where the logs burnt tidily in the great chimney, and the oak shone bright; and my mother came down the staircase in her rich gown, with spotless linen on her head. But some of the lines on her face, and some of the sternness of her voice, had come there, I thought suddenly, because she always saw not far from her such sights as I had seen today.





Ⅴ


May

The spring which has now reached us means more than the mere birth of green growing things; for once again the current of life which circles round England is melted from its winter frost, and in our little island we feel the tide chafing at our shores. For the last week or two strange wayfarers have been seen on the roads, who may be either pilgrims and pedlars, or gentlemen travelling in parties to London or the North. And at this season the mind becomes eager and hopeful even though the body must stay motionless. For as the evenings lengthen and new light seems to well up from the West so one may fancy that a new whiter light of another kind is spreading over the land; and you may feel it hitting your eyelids as you walk or sit over your embroidery.

In the midst of such a stir and tumult, one bright May morning, we saw the figure of a man striding along the road, walking fast and waving his arms as though he conversed with the air. He had a great wallet at his back and we saw that he held a stout book of parchment in one hand at which he glanced occasionally: and all the while he shouted words in a kind of measure with his feet, and his voice rose up and down, in [menace?] or in plaint till Jeremy and I shrank dose against the hedge. But he saw us; and pulled off his cap and made a deep bow; to which I curtseyed as properly as I could.

"Madam," he said, in a voice that rolled like summer thunder, "may I ask if this is the road to Long Winton?"

"It is only a mile in front of you, Sir," I said, and Jeremy waved down the road with his stick.

"Then Sir," he went on, shutting his book, and looking at once more sober and more conscious of the time and place, "may I ask further where is the house where I could sell my books most easily? I am come all the way from Cornwall, singing songs, and trying to sell the manuscripts I have with me. My wallet is still full. The times are not favourable to songs."

Indeed the man, though ruddy of cheek, and lusty of frame, was as ill dressed as any hind; and his boots were so patched that walking must have been a penance. But he had a kind of gaiety and courtesy about him, as though the fine music of his own songs dung to him and set him above ordinary thoughts.

I pulled my brother's arm, and said, "We belong to the Hall ourselves Sir, and we will gladly shew you the way. I should be very glad to see those books of yours." His eye lost its merriment at once; and he asked me almost sternly, "Can you read?"

"O Joan's always got her nose in a book," called out Jeremy, starting to talk, and pulling me too.

"Tell us about your travels Sir. Have you been to London? What is your name?"

"I am called Richard Sir," said the man smiling. "Doubtless I have another name, but I never heard it. I come from Gwithian which is in Cornwall; and I can sing you more Cornish songs, Madam, than any man in the Duchy." He turned to me, and wound up with a flourish of one hand with the book in it. "Here for instance—in this little volume, are all the stories of the Knights of the round Table; written out by the hand of Master Anthony himself, and painted by the Monks of Cam Brea. I value this more than my wife or children; for I have none; it is meat and drink to me, because I am given supper and lodging for singing the tales in it; it is horse and staff to me, for it has lifted me over many miles of weary road; and it is the best of all companions on the way; for it has always something new to sing me; and it will be silent when I wish to sleep. There never was such a book!"

Such was the way he talked, as I have never heard any man talk. For in speaking he did not seem to speak his mind exactly, or to care whether we understood him. But words seemed dear to him, whether he spoke them in jest or earnest. We reached our courtyard, and he straightened himself, flicked his boots with a handkerchief; and tried with many swift touches of his fingers to set his dress somewhat more in order than it was. Also he cleared his throat, as one preparing to sing. I ran to fetch my mother, who came slowly, and looked at him from an upper window before she would promise to hear him.

"His bag is stuffed with books, mother," I urged; "he has all the Tales of Arthur and the Round Table; I daresay he can tell us what became of Helen when her husband took her. O Mother, do let us hear him!"

She laughed at my impatience; hut bade me call Sir John, for after all it was a fine morning.

When we came down the man Richard was walking up and down, discoursing to my brother of his travels; how he had knocked one man on the head, cried to the other, "'Come on Rascal' and the whole lot had fled like," here he saw my mother, and swept off his hat as was his way.

"My daughter tells me Sir that you come from foreign parts, and can sing. We are but country people; and therefore I fear very little acquainted with the tales of other parts. But we are ready to listen. Sing us something of your land; and then, if you will, you shall sit down to meat with us, and we will gladly hear news of the country."

She sat down on a bench beneath the oak tree; and Sir John came puffing to stand by her side. She bade Jeremy open the Gates, and let any of our people in who cared to hear. They came in shyly and curiously, and stood gaping at Master Richard, who once again waved his cap at them.

He stood on a small mound of grass; and began in a high melodious voice, to tell the story of Sir Tristram and the Lady Iseult.

He dropped his gay manner, and looked past us all, with straight fixed eyes, as though he drew his words from some sight not far from him. And as the story grew passionate his voice rose, and his fists clenched, and he raised his foot and stretched forth his arms; and then, when the lovers part, he seemed to see the Lady sink away from him, and his eye sought farther and farther till the vision was faded away; and his arms were empty. And then he is wounded in Brittany; and he hears the Princess coming across the seas to him.

But I cannot tell how it seemed that the air was full of Knights and Ladies, who passed among us, hand in hand, murmuring, and seeing us not; and then the poplars and the beech trees sent grey figures, with silver gems, floating down the air; and the morning was full, suddenly, of whispers, and sighs, and lovers' laments.

But then the voice stopped; and all these figures withdrew, fading and trailing across the sky to the West where they live. And when I opened my eyes, the man, and the grey wall; the people by the Gate, slowly swam up, as from some depths, and settled on the surface, and stayed there clear and cold.

"Poor things!" spoke my mother.

Meanwhile Richard was like a man who lets something slip from his clasp; and beats thin air. He looked at us, and I had half a mind to stretch out a hand; and tell him he was safe. But then he recollected himself, and smiled as though he had reason to be pleased.

He saw the crowd at the Gate; and struck up a jolly tune, about a Nut Brown Maid and her lover, and they grinned and stamped with their feet. Then my mother bade us come into dinner; and she sat Master Richard at her right side.

He eat like a man who has fed upon hips and haws, and drunk water from the brook. And after the meat had been taken away, he solemnly swung round his wallet; and took from it various things; which he laid upon the table. There were clasps and brooches, and necklaces of beads: but there were also many sheets of parchment stiched together; though none of such a size as his book. And then seeing my desire he placed the precious volume in my hands and bade me look at its pictures. Indeed it was a beautiful work; for the capital letters framed bright blue skies, and golden robes; and in the midst of the writing there came broad spaces of colour, in which you might see princes and princesses walking in procession and towns with churches upon steep hills, and the sea breaking blue beneath them. They were like little mirrors, held up to those visions which I had seen passing in the air but here they were caught and stayed for ever.

"And have you ever seen such sights as these?" I asked him.

"They are to be seen by those who look," he answered mysteriously. And he took his manuscript from me, and tied the covers safely across it. He placed it in his breast.

It was as yellow and gnarled outside as the missal of any pious priest; but inside the brilliant knights and ladies moved, undimmed, to the unceasing melody of beautiful words. It was a fairy world that he shut inside his coat.

We offered him a night's lodging, nay more, if he would but stay and sing to us again. But he listened to our prayers no more than the owl in the ivy: saying merely, "I must go on my way." By dawn he was out of the house, and we felt as though some strange bird had rested on our roof for a moment, and flown on.

Midsummer

There comes a week, or may be it is only a day, when the year seems poised consciously on its topmost peak; it stays there motionless for along or a short time, as though in majestic contemplation, and then slowly sinks like a monarch descending from his throne, and wraps itself round in darkness.

But figures are slippery things!

At this moment I have the feeling of one swung high. into tranquil regions; upon the great back of the world. The peace of the nation, and the prosperity of our own small corner of it—for my father and brothers are at home—make a complete circle of satisfaction; you may pass from the smooth dome of sky, to our own roof without crossing any gulf.

Thus it seemed a most suitable time for our midsummer pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady at Walsingham; more especially as I have this year to give thanks for much, and to pray for more. My marriage with Sir Amyas is settled for the 20th day of December; and we are busy making ready. So yesterday I started at dawn, and travelled on foot in order to show that I approached the shrine with a humble spirit. And a good walk is surely the best preparation for prayers!

Start with your spirit fresh like a corn fed horse; let her rear and race, and bucket you hither and thither. Nothing will keep her to the road; and she will sport in dewy meadows, and crush a thousand dedicate flowers beneath her feet.

But the day grows hot; and you may lead her, still with a springing step back to the straight way; and she will carry you lightly and swiftly, till the midday sun bids you rest. In sober truth, and without metaphor, the mind drives clearly through all the mazes of a stagnant spirit when a brisk pair of legs impels it; and the creature grows nimble, with its exercise. Thus I suppose I may have thought enough for a whole week lived indoors during those three hours that I spent striding along the road to Walsingham.

And my brain that was swift and merry at first, and leapt like a child at play, settled down in time to sober work upon the highway, though it was glad withal. For I thought of the serious things of life—such as age, and poverty and sickness and death, and considered that it would certainly be my lot to meet them; and I considered also those joys and sorrows that were for ever chasing themselves across my life. Small things would no longer please me or tease me as of old. But although this made me feel grave, I felt also that I had come to the time when such feelings are true; and further, as I walked, it seemed to me that one might enter within such feelings and study them, as, indeed, I had walked in a wide space within the covers of Master Richards's manuscript.

I saw them as solid globes of crystal; enclosing a round ball of coloured earth and air, in which tiny men and women laboured, as beneath the dome of the sky itself.

Walsingham, as all the world knows, is but a very small village on the top of a hill. But as you approach through a plain that is rich with green, you see this high ground rising above you for some time before you get there. The midday sun lit up all the soft greens and blues of the fen land; and made it seem as though one passed through a soft and luxurious land, glowing like a painted book; towards a stern summit, where the light struck upon something pointing upwards that was pale as bone.

At last I reached the top of the hill, joining with a stream of other pilgrims, and we clasped hands, to show that we came humbly as human beings and trod the last steps of the road together, singing our Miserere.

There were men and women, and lame people and blind people; and some were in rags, and some had ridden on horseback; I confess that my eyes sought their faces curiously, and I thought desperately for a moment that it was terrible that flesh and [fens?] should divide us. They would have strange, merry stories to tell.

But then the pale cross with the Image struck my eyes, and drew all my mind, in reverence towards it.

I will not pretend that I found that summons other than stern; for the sun and storm have made the figure harsh and white; but the endeavour to adore Her as others were doing round me filled my mind with an image that was so large and white that no other thought had room there. For one moment I submitted myself to her as I have never submitted to man or woman, and bruised my lips on the rough stone of her garment. White light and heat steamed on my bare head; and when the ecstasy passed the country beneath flew out like a sudden banner unfurled.

Autumn

The Autumn comes; and my marriage is not far off. Sir Amyas is a good gentleman, who treats me with great courtesy and hopes to make me happy. No poet could sing of our courtship; and, I must confess that since I have taken to reading of Princesses, I have sometimes grieved that my own lot was so little like theirs. But then they did not live in Norfolk, at the time of the Civil Wars; and my mother tells me that the truth is always finest.

To prepare me for my duties as a married woman, she has let me help her in the management of the house and lands; and I begin to understand how much of my time will be passed in thoughts which have nothing to do with men or with happiness. There are the sheep, the woods, the crops, the people, things all needing my care and judgment when my Lord is away as he will be so often; and if times areas troubled as they have been, I must also act as chief Lieutenant in the disposition of his forces against the enemy. And then there will be my proper work as a woman calling me within the house. Truly, as my mother says, there will be little time for Princes and Princesses! And she went on to expound to me what she calls her theory of ownership; how, in these times, one is as the Ruler of a small island set in the midst of turbulent waters; how one must plant it and cultivate it; and drive roads through it, and fence it securely from the tides, and one day perhaps the waters will abate and this plot of ground will be ready to make part of a new world. Such is her dream of what the future may bring to England; and it has been the hope of her life to order her own province in such a way that it may make one firm spot of ground to tread on at any rate. She bids me hope that I may live to see the whole of England thus solidly established; and if I do, I shall thank my mother, and other women like her.

But I confess that deeply though I honour my mother and respect her words, I cannot accept their wisdom without a sigh. She seems to look forward to nothing better than an earth rising solid out of the mists that now enwreathe it; and the fairest prospect in her mind is, I believe, a broad road running through the land, on which she sees long strings of horsemen, riding at their ease, pilgrims stepping cheerily unarmed, and waggons that pass each other going laden to the coast and returning as heavily laden with goods taken from ships. Then she would dream of certain great houses, lying open to the sight, with their moats filled up and their towers pulled down; and the gate would open freely to any passer by; and there would be cheer for guest or serving man at the same table with the Lord. And you would ride through fields brimming with corn, and there would be flocks and herds in all the pasture lands and cottages of stone for the poor. As I write this down, I see that it is good; and we should do right to wish it.

But at the same time, when I imagine such a picture, painted before me, I cannot think it pleasant to look upon; and I fancy that I should find it hard to draw my breath upon those smooth bright ways.

Yet what it is that I want, I cannot tell, although I crave for it, and in some secret way, expect it. For often, and oftener as time goes by, I find myself suddenly halting in my walk, as though I were stopped by a strange new look upon the surface of the land which I know so well. It hints at something; but it is gone before I know what it means. It is as though a new smile crept out of a well known face; it half frightens you, and yet it beckons.





Last Pages


My father came in yesterday when I was sitting before the desk at which I write these sheets. He is not a little proud of my skill in reading and writing; which indeed I have learnt mostly at his knee.

But confusion came over me when he asked me what I wrote; and stammering that it was a "Diary" I covered the pages with my hands.

"Ah," he cried, "if my father had only kept a diary! But he, poor man, could not write his own name even. There's John and Pierce and Stephen all lying in the church yonder, and no word left to say whether they were good men or bad." Thus he spoke till my cheeks were pale again.

"And so my grandson will say of me," he went on. "And if I could I should like to write a line myself: to say 'I am Giles Martyn; I am a middle sized man, dark skinned, hazel eyed, with hair on my lip; I can read and write, but none too easy. I ride to London on as good a bay mare as is to be found in the County.'"

"Well what more should I say? And would they care to hear it? And who will they be?" he laughed; for it was his temper to end his speech with a laugh, even though he began it soberly.

"You would like to hear of your father," I said; "why shouldn't they care to hear of you?"

"My fathers were much as I am;" he said; "they lived here, all of 'em; they ploughed the same land that I plough; they married women from the countryside. Why they might walk in at the door this moment, and I should know'em, and should think it nothing strange. But the future"—he spread out his hands—"who can tell? We may be washed off the face of the earth, Joan."

"Oh no," I cried; "I am certain we shall live here always." This pleased my father secretly; for there is no man who cares more for his land and his name than he does; though he will always hold that had we been a prouder race, we should not have stayed so long in the same prosperity.

"Well then Joan, you must keep your writing," he said; "or rather, I must keep it for you. For you are going to leave us—not to go far though," he added quickly; "and names matter but little. Still, I should like to have some token of you when you are away; and our descendants shall have cause to respect one of us at least." He looked with great admiration at the neat lines of my penmanship. "Now my girl, come with me, to the Church, where I must see to the carving on my father's tomb."

As I walked with him, I thought of his words and of the many sheets that lie written in my oaken desk. Winter had come round again since I made my first flourish so proudly. Thinking that there were few women in Norfolk who could do the like; and were it not that some such pride stayed with me I think that my writing would have ceased long before this. For, truly, there is nothing in the pale of my days that needs telling; and the record grows wearisome. And I thought as I went along in the sharp air of the winter morning, that if I ever write again it shall not be of Norfolk and myself, but of Knights and Ladies and of adventures in strange lands. The clouds even, which roll up from the west and advance across the sky take the likeness of Captains and of soldiery and I can scarcely cease from fashioning helmets and swords, as well as fair faces, and high headdresses from these waves of coloured mist.

But as my mother would say, the best of stories are those that are told over the fire side; and I shall be well content if I may end my days as one of those old women who can keen a household still on a winter's evening, with her tales of the strange sights that she saw and the deeds that were done in her youth. I have always thought that such stories came partly out of the clouds, or why should they stir us more than anything we can see for ourselves? It is certain that no written book can stand beside them.

Such a woman was Dame Elsbeth Aske, who, when she grew too old to knit or stitch and too stiff to leave her chair, sat with clasped hands by the fire all day long, and you had only to pull her sleeve and her eyes grew bright, and she would tell you stories of fights and kings, and great nobles, and stories of the poor people too, till the air seemed to move and murmur. She could sing ballads also; which she made as she sat there. And men and women, old and young, came long distances to hear her; for all that she could neither write nor read. And they thought that she could tell the future too.

Thus we came to the church where my fathers lie buried. The famous stone Carver, Ralph of Norwich, has lately wrought a tomb for my grandfather, and it lies almost finished now, above his body; and the candles were flaring upright in the dim church when we entered. We knelt and whispered prayers for his soul; and then my father withdrew in talk with Sir John; and left me to my favourite task of spelling out the names and gazing down at the features of my dead kinsmen and ancestors. As a child I know the stark white figures used to frighten me; especially when I could read that they bore my name; but now that I know that they never move from their backs, and keep their hands crossed always, I pity them; and would fain do some small act that would give them pleasure. It must be something secret, and unthought of—a kiss or a stroke, such as you give a living person.





Flush: A Biography


Chapter One Three Mile Cross


It is universally admitted that the family from which the subject of this memoir claims descent is one of the greatest antiquity. Therefore it is not strange that the origin of the name itself is lost in obscurity. Many million years ago the country which is now called Spain seethed uneasily in the ferment of creation. Ages passed; vegetation appeared; where there is vegetation the law of Nature has decreed that there shall be rabbits; where there are rabbits, Providence has ordained there shall be dogs. There is nothing in this that calls for question, or comment. But when we ask why the dog that caught the rabbit was called a Spaniel, then doubts and difficulties begin. Some historians say that when the Carthaginians landed in Spain the common soldiers shouted with one accord "Span! Span!"—for rabbits darted from every scrub, from every bush. The land was alive with rabbits. And Spanin the Carthaginian tongue signifies Rabbit. Thus the land was called Hispania, or Rabbit-land, and the dogs, which were almost instantly perceived in full pursuit of the rabbits, were called Spaniels or rabbit dogs.

There many of us would be content to let the matter rest; but truth compels us to add that there is another school of thought which thinks differently. The word Hispania, these scholars say, has nothing whatever to do with the Carthaginian word span. Hispania derives from the Basque word españa, signifying an edge or boundary. If that is so, rabbits, bushes, dogs, soldiers—the whole of that romantic and pleasant picture, must be dismissed from the mind; and we must simply suppose that the Spaniel is called a spaniel because Spain is called España. As for the third school of antiquaries which maintains that just as a lover calls his mistress monster or monkey, so the Spaniards called their favourite dogs crooked or cragged (the word españa can be made to take these meanings) because a spaniel is notoriously the opposite—that is too fanciful a conjecture to be seriously entertained.

Passing over these theories, and many more which need not detain us here, we reach Wales in the middle of the tenth century. The spaniel is already there, brought, some say, by the Spanish clan of Ebhor or Ivor many centuries previously; and certainly by the middle of the tenth century a dog of high repute and value. "The Spaniel of the King is a pound in value," Howel Dda laid down in his Book of Laws. And when we remember what the pound could buy in the year A.D. 948—how many wives, slaves, horses, oxen, turkeys and geese—it is plain that the spaniel was already a dog of value and reputation. He had his place already by the King's side. His family was held in honour before those of many famous monarchs. He was taking his ease in palaces when the Plantagenets and the Tudors and the Stuarts were following other people's ploughs through other people's mud. Long before the Howards, the Cavendishes or the Russells had risen above the common ruck of Smiths, Joneses and Tomkins, the Spaniel family was a family distinguished and apart. And as the centuries took their way, minor branches broke off from the parent stem. By degrees, as English history pursues its course, there came into existence at least seven famous Spaniel families—the Clumber, the Sussex, the Norfolk, the Black Field, the Cocker, the Irish Water and the English Water, all deriving from the original spaniel of prehistoric days but showing distinct characteristics, and therefore no doubt claiming privileges as distinct. That there was an aristocracy of dogs by the time Queen Elizabeth was on the throne Sir Philip Sidney bears witness:"... greyhounds, Spaniels and Hounds," he observes, "whereof the first might seem the Lords, the second the Gentlemen, and the last the Yeomen of dogs," he writes in the Arcadia.

But if we are thus led to assume that the Spaniels followed human example, and looked up to Greyhounds as their superiors and considered Hounds beneath them, we have to admit that their aristocracy was founded on better reasons than ours. Such at least must be the conclusion of anyone who studies the laws of the Spaniel Club. By that august body it is plainly laid down what constitute the vices of a spaniel, and what constitute its virtues. Light eyes, for example, are undesirable; curled ears are still worse; to be born with a light nose or a topknot is nothing less than fatal. The merits of the spaniel are equally clearly defined. His head must be smooth, rising without a too-decided stoop from the muzzle; the skull must be comparatively rounded and well developed with plenty of room for brain power; the eyes must be full but not gozzled; the general expression must be one of intelligence and gentleness. The spaniel that exhibits these points is encouraged and bred from; the spaniel who persists in perpetuating topknots and light noses is cut off from the privileges and emoluments of his kind. Thus the judges lay down the law and, laying down the law, impose penalties and privileges which ensure that the law shall be obeyed.

But, if we now turn to human society, what chaos and confusion meet the eye! No Club has any such jurisdiction upon the breed of man. The Heralds College is the nearest approach we have to the Spaniel Club. It at least makes some attempt to preserve the purity of the human family. But when we ask what constitutes noble birth—should our eyes be light or dark, our ears curled or straight, are topknots fatal, our judges merely refer us to our coats of arms. You have none perhaps. Then you are nobody. But once make good your claim to sixteen quarterings, prove your right to a coronet, and then you are not only born they say, but nobly born into the bargain. Hence it is that not a muffineer in all Mayfair lacks its lion couchant or its mermaid rampant. Even our linendrapers mount the Royal Arms above their doors, as though that were proof that their sheets are safe to sleep in. Everywhere rank is claimed and its virtues are asserted. Yet when we come to survey the Royal Houses of Bourbon, Hapsburg and Hohenzollern, decorated with how many coronets and quarterings, couchant and rampant with how many lions and leopards, and find them now in exile, deposed from authority, judged unworthy of respect, we can but shake our heads and admit that the Judges of the Spaniel Club judged better. Such is the lesson that is enforced directly we turn from these high matters to consider the early life of Flush in the family of the Mitfords.

About the end of the eighteenth century a family of the famous spaniel breed was living near Reading in the house of a certain Dr. Midford or Mitford. That gentleman, in conformity with the canons of the Heralds College, chose to spell his name with a t, and thus claimed descent from the Northumberland family of the Mitfords of Bertram Castle. His wife was a Miss Russell, and sprang, if remotely, still decidedly from the ducal house of Bedford. But the mating of Dr. Mitford's ancestors had been carried on with such wanton disregard for principles that no bench of judges could have admitted his claim to be well bred or have allowed him to perpetuate his kind. His eyes were light; his ears were curled; his head exhibited the fatal topknot. In other words, he was utterly selfish, recklessly extravagant, worldly, insincere and addicted to gambling. He wasted his own fortune, his wife's fortune, and his daughter's earnings. He deserted them in his prosperity and sponged upon them in his infirmity. Two points he had in his favour indeed, great personal beauty—he was like an Apollo until gluttony and intemperance changed Apollo into Bacchus—and he was genuinely devoted to dogs. But there can be no doubt that, had there been a Man Club corresponding to the Spaniel Club in existence, no spelling of Mitford with a t instead of with a d, no claim to kinship with the Mitfords of Bertram Castle, would have availed to protect him from contumely and contempt, from all the penalties of outlawry and ostracism, from being branded as a mongrel man unfitted to carry on his kind. But he was a human being. Nothing therefore prevented him from marrying a lady of birth and breeding, from living for over eighty years, from having in his possession several generations of greyhounds and spaniels and from begetting a daughter.

All researches have failed to fix with any certainty the exact year of Flush's birth, let alone the month or the day; but it is likely that he was born some time early in the year 1842. It is also probable that he was directly descended from Tray (c. 1816), whose points, preserved unfortunately only in the untrustworthy medium of poetry, prove him to have been a red cocker spaniel of merit. There is every reason to think that Flush was the son of that "real old cocking spaniel" for whom Dr. Mitford refused twenty guineas "on account of his excellence in the field." It is to poetry, alas, that we have to trust for our most detailed description of Flush himself as a young dog. He was of that particular shade of dark brown which in sunshine flashes "all over into gold." His eyes were "startled eyes of hazel bland." His ears were "tasselled"; his "slender feet" were "canopied in fringes" and his tail was broad. Making allowance for the exigencies of rhyme and the inaccuracies of poetic diction, there is nothing here but what would meet with the approval of the Spaniel Club. We cannot doubt that Flush was a pure-bred Cocker of the red variety marked by all the characteristic excellences of his kind.

The first months of his life were passed at Three Mile Cross, a working man's cottage near Reading. Since the Mitfords had fallen on evil days—Kerenhappock was the only servant—the chair-covers were made by Miss Mitford herself and of the cheapest material; the most important article of furniture seems to have been a large table; the most important room a large greenhouse—it is unlikely that Flush was surrounded by any of those luxuries, rainproof kennels, cement walks, a maid or boy attached to his person, that would now be accorded a dog of his rank. But he throve; he enjoyed with all the vivacity of his temperament most of the pleasures and some of the licences natural to his youth and sex. Miss Mitford, it is true, was much confined to the cottage. She had to read aloud to her father hour after hour; then to play cribbage; then, when at last he slumbered, to write and write and write at the table in the greenhouse in the attempt to pay their bills and settle their debts. But at last the longed-for moment would come. She thrust her papers aside, clapped a hat on her head, took her umbrella and set off for a walk across the fields with her dogs. Spaniels are by nature sympathetic; Flush, as his story proves, had an even excessive appreciation of human emotions. The sight of his dear mistress snuffing the fresh air at last, letting it ruffle her white hair and redden the natural freshness of her face, while the lines on her huge brow smoothed themselves out, excited him to gambols whose wildness was half sympathy with her own delight. As she strode through the long grass, so he leapt hither and thither, parting its green curtain. The cool globes of dew or rain broke in showers of iridescent spray about his nose; the earth, here hard, here soft, here hot, here cold, stung, teased and tickled the soft pads of his feet. Then what a variety of smells interwoven in subtlest combination thrilled his nostrils; strong smells of earth, sweet smells of flowers; nameless smells of leaf and bramble; sour smells as they crossed the road; pungent smells as they entered bean-fields. But suddenly down the wind came tearing a smell sharper, stronger, more lacerating than any—a smell that ripped across his brain stirring a thousand instincts, releasing a million memories—the smell of hare, the smell of fox. Off he flashed like a fish drawn in a rush through water further and further. He forgot his mistress; he forgot all humankind. He heard dark men cry "Span! Span!" He heard whips crack. He raced; he rushed. At last he stopped bewildered; the incantation faded; very slowly, wagging his tail sheepishly, he trotted back across the fields to where Miss Mitford stood shouting "Flush! Flush! Flush!" and waving her umbrella. And once at least the call was even more imperious; the hunting horn roused deeper instincts, summoned wilder and stronger emotions that transcended memory and obliterated grass, trees, hare, rabbit, fox in one wild shout of ecstasy. Love blazed her torch in his eyes; he heard the hunting horn of Venus. Before he was well out of his puppy-hood, Flush was a father.

Such conduct in a man even, in the year 1842, would have called for some excuse from a biographer; in a woman no excuse could have availed; her name must have been blotted in ignominy from the page. But the moral code of dogs, whether better or worse, is certainly different from ours, and there was nothing in Flush's conduct in this respect that requires a veil now, or unfitted him for the society of the purest and the chastest in the land then. There is evidence, that is to say, that the elder brother of Dr. Pusey was anxious to buy him. Deducing from the known character of Dr. Pusey the probable character of his brother, there must have been something serious, solid, promising well for future excellence whatever might be the levity of the present in Flush even as a puppy. But a much more significant testimony to the attractive nature of his gifts is that, even though Mr. Pusey wished to buy him, Miss Mitford refused to sell him. As she was at her wits' end for money, scarcely knew indeed what tragedy to spin, what annual to edit, and was reduced to the repulsive expedient of asking her friends for help, it must have gone hard with her to refuse the sum offered by the elder brother of Dr. Pusey. Twenty pounds had been offered for Flush's father. Miss Mitford might well have asked ten or fifteen for Flush. Ten or fifteen pounds was a princely sum, a magnificent sum to have at her disposal. With ten or fifteen pounds she might have re-covered her chairs, she might have re-stocked her greenhouse, she might have bought herself an entire wardrobe, and "I have not bought a bonnet, a cloak, a gown, hardly a pair of gloves," she wrote in 1842, "for four years."

But to sell Flush was unthinkable. He was of the rare order of objects that cannot be associated with money. Was he not of the still rarer kind that, because they typify what is spiritual, what is beyond price, become a fitting token of the disinterestedness of friendship; may be offered in that spirit to a friend, if one is so lucky enough as to have one, who is more like a daughter than a friend; to a friend who lies secluded all through the summer months in a back bedroom in Wimpole Street, to a friend who is no other than England's foremost poetess, the brilliant, the doomed, the adored Elizabeth Barrett herself? Such were the thoughts that came more and more frequently to Miss Mitford as she watched Flush rolling and scampering in the sunshine; as she sat by the couch of Miss Barrett in her dark, ivy-shaded London bedroom. Yes; Flush was worthy of Miss Barrett; Miss Barrett was worthy of Flush. The sacrifice was a great one; but the sacrifice must be made. Thus, one day, probably in the early summer of the year 1842, a remarkable couple might have been seen taking their way down Wimpole Street—a very short, stout, shabby, elderly lady, with a bright red face and bright white hair, who led by the chain a very spirited, very inquisitive, very well-bred golden cocker spaniel puppy. They walked almost the whole length of the street until at last they paused at No. 50. Not without trepidation, Miss Mitford rang the bell.

Even now perhaps nobody rings the bell of a house in Wimpole Street without trepidation. It is the most august of London streets, the most impersonal. Indeed, when the world seems tumbling to ruin, and civilisation rocks on its foundations, one has only to go to Wimpole Street; to pace that avenue; to survey those houses; to consider their uniformity; to marvel at the window curtains and their consistency; to admire the brass knockers and their regularity; to observe butchers tendering joints and cooks receiving them; to reckon the incomes of the inhabitants and infer their consequent submission to the laws of God and man—one has only to go to Wimpole Street and drink deep of the peace breathed by authority in order to heave a sigh of thankfulness that, while Corinth has fallen and Messina has tumbled, while crowns have blown down the wind and old Empires have gone up in flames, Wimpole Street has remained unmoved and, turning from Wimpole Street into Oxford Street, a prayer rises in the heart and bursts from the lips that not a brick of Wimpole Street may be repointed, not a curtain washed, not a butcher fail to tender or a cook to receive the sirloin, the haunch, the breast, the ribs of mutton and beef for ever and ever, for as long as Wimpole Street remains, civilisation is secure.

The butlers of Wimpole Street move ponderously even to-day; in the summer of 1842 they were more deliberate still. The laws of livery were then more stringent; the ritual of the green baize apron for cleaning silver; of the striped waistcoat and swallow-tail black coat for opening the hall door, was more closely observed. It is likely then that Miss Mitford and Flush were kept waiting at least three minutes and a half on the door-step. At last, however, the door of number fifty was flung wide; Miss Mitford and Flush were ushered in. Miss Mitford was a frequent visitor; there was nothing to surprise, though something to subdue her, in the sight of the Barrett family mansion. But the effect upon Flush must have been overwhelming in the extreme. Until this moment he had set foot in no house but the working man's cottage at Three Mile Cross. The boards there were bare; the mats were frayed; the chairs were cheap. Here there was nothing bare, nothing frayed, nothing cheap—that Flush could see at a glance. Mr. Barrett, the owner, was a rich merchant; he had a large family of grown-up sons and daughters, and a retinue, proportionately large, of servants. His house was furnished in the fashion of the late thirties, with some tincture, no doubt, of that Eastern fantasy which had led him when he built a house in Shropshire to adorn it with the domes and crescents of Moorish architecture. Here in Wimpole Street such extravagance would not be allowed; but we may suppose that the high dark rooms were full of ottomans and carved mahogany; tables were twisted; filigree ornaments stood upon them; daggers and swords hung upon wine-dark walls; curious objects brought from his East Indian property stood in recesses, and thick rich carpets clothed the floors.

But as Flush trotted up behind Miss Mitford, who was behind the butler, he was more astonished by what he smelt than by what he saw. Up the funnel of the staircase came warm whiffs of joints roasting, of fowls basting, of soups simmering—ravishing almost as food itself to nostrils used to the meagre savour of Kerenhappock's penurious frys and hashes. Mixing with the smell of food were further smells—smells of cedarwood and sandalwood and mahogany; scents of male bodies and female bodies; of men servants and maid servants; of coats and trousers; of crinolines and mantles; of curtains of tapestry, of curtains of plush; of coal dust and fog; of wine and cigars. Each room as he passed it—dining-room, drawing-room, library, bedroom—wafted out its own contribution to the general stew; while, as he set down first one paw and then another, each was caressed and retained by the sensuality of rich pile carpets closing amorously over it. At length they reached a closed door at the back of the house. A gentle tap was given; gently the door was opened.

Miss Barrett's bedroom—for such it was—must by all accounts have been dark. The light, normally obscured by a curtain of green damask, was in summer further dimmed by the ivy, the scarlet runners, the convolvuluses and the nasturtiums which grew in the window-box. At first Flush could distinguish nothing in the pale greenish gloom but five white globes glimmering mysteriously in mid-air. But again it was the smell of the room that overpowered him. Only a scholar who has descended step by step into a mausoleum and there finds himself in a crypt, crusted with fungus, slimy with mould, exuding sour smells of decay and antiquity, while half-obliterated marble busts gleam in midair and all is dimly seen by the light of the small swinging lamp which he holds, and dips and turns, glancing now here, now there—only the sensations of such an explorer into the buried vaults of a ruined city can compare with the riot of emotions that flooded Flush's nerves as he stood for the first time in an invalid's bedroom, in Wimpole Street, and smelt eau-de-cologne.

Very slowly, very dimly, with much sniffing and pawing, Flush by degrees distinguished the outlines of several articles of furniture. That huge object by the window was perhaps a wardrobe. Next to it stood, conceivably, a chest of drawers. In the middle of the room swam up to the surface what seemed to be a table with a ring round it; and then the vague amorphous shapes of armchair and table emerged. But everything was disguised. On top of the wardrobe stood three white busts; the chest of drawers was surmounted by a bookcase; the bookcase was pasted over with crimson merino; the washing-table had a coronal of shelves upon it; on top of the shelves that were on top of the washing-table stood two more busts. Nothing in the room was itself; everything was something else. Even the window-blind was not a simple muslin blind; it was a painted fabric[1] with a design of castles and gateways and groves of trees, and there were several peasants taking a walk. Looking-glasses further distorted these already distorted objects so that there seemed to be ten busts of ten poets instead of five; four tables instead of two. And suddenly there was a more terrifying confusion still. Suddenly Flush saw staring back at him from a hole in the wall another dog with bright eyes flashing, and tongue lolling! He paused amazed. He advanced in awe.

Thus advancing, thus withdrawing, Flush scarcely heard, save as the distant drone of wind among the tree-tops, the murmur and patter of voices talking. He pursued his investigations, cautiously, nervously, as an explorer in a forest softly advances his foot, uncertain whether that shadow is a lion, or that root a cobra. At last, however, he was aware of huge objects in commotion over him; and, unstrung as he was by the experiences of the past hour, he hid himself, trembling, behind a screen. The voices ceased. A door shut. For one instant he paused, bewildered, unstrung. Then with a pounce as of clawed tigers memory fell upon him. He felt himself alone—deserted. He rushed to the door. It was shut. He pawed, he listened. He heard footsteps descending. He knew them for the familiar footsteps of his mistress. They stopped. But no—on they went, down they went. Miss Mitford was slowly, was heavily, was reluctantly descending the stairs. And as she went, as he heard her footsteps fade, panic seized upon him. Door after door shut in his face as Miss Mitford went downstairs; they shut on freedom; on fields; on hares; on grass; on his adored, his venerated mistress—on the dear old woman who had washed him and beaten him and fed him from her own plate when she had none too much to eat herself—on all he had known of happiness and love and human goodness! There! The front door slammed. He was alone. She had deserted him.

Then such a wave of despair and anguish overwhelmed him, the irrevocableness and implacability of fate so smote him, that he lifted up his head and howled aloud. A voice said "Flush." He did not hear it. "Flush," it repeated a second time. He started. He had thought himself alone. He turned. Was there something alive in the room with him? Was there something on the sofa? In the wild hope that this being, whatever it was, might open the door, that he might still rush after Miss Mitford and find her—that this was some game of hide-and-seek such as they used to play in the greenhouse at home—Flush darted to the sofa.

"Oh, Flush!" said Miss Barrett. For the first time she looked him in the face. For the first time Flush looked at the lady lying on the sofa.

Each was surprised. Heavy curls hung down on either side of Miss Barrett's face; large bright eyes shone out; a large mouth smiled. Heavy ears hung down on either side of Flush's face; his eyes, too, were large and bright: his mouth was wide. There was a likeness between them. As they gazed at each other each felt: Here am I—and then each felt: But how different! Hers was the pale worn face of an invalid, cut off from air, light, freedom. His was the warm ruddy face of a young animal; instinct with health and energy. Broken asunder, yet made in the same mould, could it be that each completed what was dormant in the other? She might have been—all that; and he—But no. Between them lay the widest gulf that can separate one being from another. She spoke. He was dumb. She was woman; he was dog. Thus closely united, thus immensely divided, they gazed at each other. Then with one bound Flush sprang on to the sofa and laid himself where he was to lie for ever after—on the rug at Miss Barrett's feet.





Chapter Two The Back Bedroom


The summer of 1842 was, historians tell us, not much different from other summers, yet to Flush it was so different that he must have doubted if the world itself were the same. It was a summer spent in a bedroom; a summer spent with Miss Barrett. It was a summer spent in London, spent in the heart of civilisation. At first he saw nothing but the bedroom and its furniture, but that alone was surprising enough. To identify, distinguish and call by their right names all the different articles he saw there was confusing enough. And he had scarcely accustomed himself to the tables, to the busts, to the washing-stands— the smell of eau-de-cologne still lacerated his nostrils, when there came one of those rare days which are fine but not windy, warm but not baking, dry but not dusty, when an invalid can take the air. The day came when Miss Barrett could safely risk the huge adventure of going shopping with her sister.

The carriage was ordered; Miss Barrett rose from her sofa; veiled and muffled, she descended the stairs. Flush of course went with her. He leapt into the carriage by her side. Couched on her lap, the whole pomp of London at its most splendid burst on his astonished eyes. They drove along Oxford Street. He saw houses made almost entirely of glass. He saw windows laced across with glittering streamers; heaped with gleaming mounds of pink, purple, yellow, rose. The carriage stopped. He entered mysterious arcades filmed with clouds and webs of tinted gauze. A million airs from China, from Arabia, wafted their frail incense into the remotest fibres of his senses. Swiftly over the counters flashed yards of gleaming silk; more darkly, more slowly rolled the ponderous bombazine. Scissors snipped; coins sparkled. Paper was folded; string tied. What with nodding plumes, waving streamers, tossing horses, yellow liveries, passing faces, leaping, dancing up, down, Flush, satiated with the multiplicity of his sensations, slept, drowsed, dreamt and knew no more until he was lifted out of the carriage and the door of Wimpole Street shut on him again.

And next day, as the fine weather continued, Miss Barrett ventured upon an even more daring exploit—she had herself drawn up Wimpole Street in a bath-chair. Again Flush went with her. For the first time he heard his nails click upon the hard paving-stones of London. For the first time the whole battery of a London street on a hot summer's day assaulted his nostrils. He smelt the swooning smells that lie in the gutters; the bitter smells that corrode iron railings; the fuming, heady smells that rise from basements—smells more complex, corrupt, violently contrasted and compounded than any he had smelt in the fields near Reading; smells that lay far beyond the range of the human nose; so that while the chair went on, he stopped, amazed; smelling, savouring, until a jerk at his collar dragged him on. And also, as he trotted up Wimpole Street behind Miss Barrett's chair he was dazed by the passage of human bodies. Petticoats swished at his head; trousers brushed his flanks; sometimes a wheel whizzed an inch from his nose; the wind of destruction roared in his ears and fanned the feathers of his paws as a van passed. Then he plunged in terror. Mercifully the chain tugged at his collar; Miss Barrett held him tight, or he would have rushed to destruction.

At last, with every nerve throbbing and every sense singing, he reached Regent's Park. And then when he saw once more, after years of absence it seemed, grass, flowers and trees, the old hunting cry of the fields hallooed in his ears and he dashed forward to run as he had run in the fields at home. But now a heavy weight jerked at his throat; he was thrown back on his haunches. Were there not trees and grass? he asked. Were these not the signals of freedom? Had he not always leapt forward directly Miss Mitford started on her walk? Why was he a prisoner here? He paused. Here, he observed, the flowers were massed far more thickly than at home; they stood, plant by plant, rigidly in narrow plots. The plots were intersected by hard black paths. Men in shiny top-hats marched ominously up and down the paths. At the sight of them he shuddered closer to the chair. He gladly accepted the protection of the chain. Thus before many of these walks were over a new conception had entered his brain. Setting one thing beside another, he had arrived at a conclusion. Where there are flower-beds there are asphalt paths; where there are flower-beds and asphalt paths, there are men in shiny top-hats; where there are flower-beds and asphalt paths and men in shiny top-hats, dogs must be led on chains. Without being able to decipher a word of the placard at the Gate, he had learnt his lesson—in Regent's Park dogs must be led on chains.

And to this nucleus of knowledge, born from the strange experiences of the summer of 1842, soon adhered another: dogs are not equal, but different. At Three Mile Cross Flush had mixed impartially with tap-room dogs and the Squire's greyhounds; he had known no difference between the tinker's dog and himself. Indeed it is probable that the mother of his child, though by courtesy called Spaniel, was nothing but a mongrel, eared in one way, tailed in another. But the dogs of London, Flush soon discovered, are strictly divided into different classes. Some are chained dogs; some run wild. Some take their airings in carriages and drink from purple jars; others are unkempt and uncollared and pick up a living in the gutter. Dogs therefore, Flush began to suspect, differ; some are high, others low; and his suspicions were confirmed by snatches of talk held in passing with the dogs of Wimpole Street. "See that scallywag? A mere mongrel!... By gad, that's a fine Spaniel. One of the best blood in Britain! ... Pity his ears aren't a shade more curly... . There's a topknot for you!"

From such phrases, from the accent of praise or derision in which they were spoken, at the pillar-box or outside the public-house where the footmen were exchanging racing tips, Flush knew before the summer had passed that there is no equality among dogs: there are high dogs and low dogs. Which, then, was he? No sooner had Flush got home than he examined himself carefully in the lookingglass. Heaven be praised, he was a dog of birth and breeding! His head was smooth; his eyes were prominent but not gozzled; his feet were feathered; he was the equal of the best-bred cocker in Wimpole Street. He noted with approval the purple jar from which he drank—such are the privileges of rank; he bent his head quietly to have the chain fixed to his collar—such are its penalties. When about this time Miss Barrett observed him staring in the glass, she was mistaken. He was a philosopher, she thought, meditating the difference between appearance and reality. On the contrary, he was an aristocrat considering his points.

But the fine summer days were soon over; the autumn winds began to blow; and Miss Barrett settled down to a life of complete seclusion in her bedroom. Flush's life was also changed. His outdoor education was supplemented by that of the bed-room, and this, to a dog of Flush's temperament, was the most drastic that could have been invented. His only airings, and these were brief and perfunctory, were taken in the company of Wilson, Miss Barrett's maid. For the rest of the day he kept his station on the sofa at Miss Barrett's feet. All his natural instincts were thwarted and contradicted. When the autumn winds had blown last year in Berkshire he had run in wild scampering across the stubble; now at the sound of the ivy tapping on the pane Miss Barrett asked Wilson to see to the fastenings of the window. When the leaves of the scarlet runners and nasturtiums in the window- box yellowed and fell she drew her Indian shawl more closely round her. When the October rain lashed the window Wilson lit the fire and heaped up the coals. Autumn deepened into winter and the first fogs jaundiced the air. Wilson and Flush could scarcely grope their way to the pillar-box or to the chemist. When they came back, nothing could be seen in the room but the pale busts glimmering wanly on the tops of the wardrobes; the peasants and the castle had vanished on the blind; blank yellow filled the pane. Flush felt that he and Miss Barrett lived alone together in a cushioned and fire-lit cave. The traffic droned on perpetually outside with muffled reverberations; now and again a voice went calling hoarsely, "Old chairs and baskets to mend", down the street: sometimes there was a jangle of organ music, coming nearer and louder; going further and fading away. But none of these sounds meant freedom, or action, or exercise. The wind and the rain, the wild days of autumn and the cold days of mid-winter, all alike meant nothing to Flush except warmth and stillness; the lighting of lamps, the drawing of curtains and the poking of the fire.

At first the strain was too great to be borne. He could not help dancing round the room on a windy autumn day when the partridges must be scattering over the stubble. He thought he heard guns on the breeze. He could not help running to the door with his hackles raised when a dog barked outside. And yet when Miss Barrett called him back, when she laid her hand on his collar, he could not deny that another feeling, urgent, contradictory, disagreeable—he did not know what to call it or why he obeyed it—restrained him. He lay still at her feet. To resign, to control, to suppress the most violent instincts of his nature—that was the prime lesson of the bedroom school, and it was one of such portentous difficulty that many scholars have learnt Greek with less—many battles have been won that cost their generals not half such pain. But then, Miss Barrett was the teacher. Between them, Flush felt more and more strongly, as the weeks wore on, was a bond, an uncomfortable yet thrilling tightness; so that if his pleasure was her pain, then his pleasure was pleasure no longer but three parts pain. The truth of this was proved every day. Somebody opened the door and whistled him to come. Why should he not go out? He longed for air and exercise; his limbs were cramped with lying on the sofa. He had never grown altogether used to the smell of eau-de-cologne. But no—though the door stood open, he would not leave Miss Barrett. He hesitated halfway to the door and then went back to the sofa. "Flushie," wrote Miss Barrett, "is my friend—my companion—and loves me better than he loves the sunshine without." She could not go out. She was chained to the sofa. "A bird in a cage would have as good a story," she wrote, as she had. And Flush, to whom the whole world was free, chose to forfeit all the smells of Wimpole Street in order to lie by her side.

And yet sometimes the tie would almost break; there were vast gaps in their understanding. Sometimes they would lie and stare at each other in blank bewilderment. Why, Miss Barrett wondered, did Flush tremble suddenly, and whimper and start and listen? She could hear nothing; she could see nothing; there was nobody in the room with them. She could not guess that Folly, her sister's little King Charles, had passed the door; or that Catiline, the Cuba bloodhound, had been given a mutton-bone by a footman in the basement. But Flush knew; he heard; he was ravaged by the alternate rages of lust and greed. Then with all her poet's imagination Miss Barrett could not divine what Wilson's wet umbrella meant to Flush; what memories it recalled, of forests and parrots and wild trumpeting elephants; nor did she know, when Mr. Kenyon stumbled over the bell-pull, that Flush heard dark men cursing in the mountains; the cry, "Span! Span!" rang in his ears, and it was in some muffled, ancestral rage that he bit him.

Flush was equally at a loss to account for Miss Barrett's emotions. There she would lie hour after hour passing her hand over a white page with a black stick; and her eyes would suddenly fill with tears; but why? "Ah, my dear Mr. Horne," she was writing. "And then came the failure in my health ... and then the enforced exile to Torquay ... which gave a nightmare to my life for ever, and robbed it of more than I can speak of here; do not speak of that anywhere. Do not speak of that, dear Mr. Horne." But there was no sound in the room, no smell to make Miss Barrett cry. Then again Miss Barrett, still agitating her stick, burst out laughing. She had drawn "a very neat and characteristic portrait of Flush, humorously made rather like myself," and she had written under it that it "only fails of being an excellent substitute for mine through being more worthy than I can be counted." What was there to laugh at in the black smudge that she held out for Flush to look at? He could smell nothing; he could hear nothing. There was nobody in the room with them. The fact was that they could not communicate with words, and it was a fact that led undoubtedly to much misunderstanding. Yet did it not lead also to a peculiar intimacy? "Writing", Miss Barrett once exclaimed after a morning's toil, "writing, writing ..." After all, she may have thought, do words say everything? Can words say anything? Do not words destroy the symbol that lies beyond the reach of words? Once at least Miss Barrett seems to have found it so. She was lying, thinking; she had forgotten Flush altogether, and her thoughts were so sad that the tears fell upon the pillow. Then suddenly a hairy head was pressed against her; large bright eyes shone in hers; and she started. Was it Flush, or was it Pan? Was she no longer an invalid in Wimpole Street, but a Greek nymph in some dim grove in Arcady? And did the bearded god himself press his lips to hers? For a moment she was transformed; she was a nymph and Flush was Pan. The sun burnt and love blazed. But suppose Flush had been able to speak—would he not have said something sensible about the potato disease in Ireland?

So, too, Flush felt strange stirrings at work within him. When he saw Miss Barrett's thin hands delicately lifting some silver box or pearl ornament from the ringed table, his own furry paws seemed to contract and he longed that they should fine themselves to ten separate fingers. When he heard her low voice syllabling innumerable sounds, he longed for the day when his own rough roar would issue like hers in the little simple sounds that had such mysterious meaning. And when he watched the same fingers for ever crossing a white page with a straight stick, he longed for the time when he too should blacken paper as she did.

And yet, had he been able to write as she did?—The question is superfluous happily, for truth compels us to say that in the year 1842- 43 Miss Barrett was not a nymph but an invalid; Flush was not a poet but a red cocker spaniel; and Wimpole Street was not Arcady but Wimpole Street.

So the long hours went by in the back bedroom with nothing to mark them but the sound of steps passing on the stairs; and the distant sound of the front door shutting, and the sound of a broom tapping, and the sound of the postman knocking. In the room coals clicked; the lights and shadows shifted themselves over the brows of the five pale busts, over the bookcase and its red merino. But sometimes the step on the stair did not pass the door; it stopped outside. The handle was seen to spin round; the door actually opened; somebody came in. Then how strangely the furniture changed its look! What extraordinary eddies of sound and smell were at once set in circulation! How they washed round the legs of tables and impinged on the sharp edges of the wardrobe! Probably it was Wilson, with a tray of food or a glass of medicine; or it might be one of Miss Barrett's two sisters—Arabel or Henrietta; or it might be one of Miss Barrett's seven brothers— Charles, Samuel, George, Henry, Alfred, Septimus or Octavius. But once or twice a week Flush was aware that something more important was about to happen. The bed would be carefully disguised as a sofa. The armchair would be drawn up beside it; Miss Barrett herself would be wrapped becomingly in Indian shawls; the toilet things would be scrupulously hidden under the busts of Chaucer and Homer; Flush himself would be combed and brushed. At about two or three in the afternoon there was a peculiar, distinct and different tap at the door. Miss Barrett flushed, smiled and stretched out her hand. Then in would come—perhaps dear Miss Mitford, rosy and shiny and chattering, with a bunch of geraniums. Or it might be Mr. Kenyon, a stout, well- groomed elderly gentleman, radiating benevolence, provided with a book. Or it might be Mrs. Jameson, a lady who was the very opposite of Mr. Kenyon to look at—a lady with "a very light complexion—pale, lucid, eyes; thin colourless lips... a nose and chin projective without breadth". Each had his or her own manner, smell, tone and accent. Miss Mitford burbled and chattered, was fly-away yet substantial; Mr. Kenyon was urbane and cultured and mumbled slightly because he had lost two front teeth;[2] Mrs. Jameson had lost none of her teeth, and moved as sharply and precisely as she spoke.

Lying couched at Miss Barrett's feet, Flush let the voices ripple over him, hour by hour. On and on they went. Miss Barrett laughed, expostulated, exclaimed, sighed too, and laughed again. At last, greatly to Flush's relief, little silences came—even in the flow of Miss Mitford's conversation. Could it be seven already? She had been there since midday! She must really run to catch her train. Mr. Kenyon shut his book—he had been reading aloud—and stood with his back to the fire; Mrs. Jameson with a sharp, angular movement pressed each finger of her glove sharp down. And Flush was patted by this one and had his ear pulled by another. The routine of leave-taking was intolerably prolonged; but at last Mrs. Jameson, Mr. Kenyon, and even Miss Mitford had risen, had said good-bye, had remembered something, had lost something, had found something, had reached the door, had opened it, and were—Heaven be praised—gone at last.

Miss Barrett sank back very white, very tired on her pillows. Flush crept closer to her. Mercifully they were alone again. But the visitor had stayed so long that it was almost dinner-time. Smells began to rise from the basement. Wilson was at the door with Miss Barrett's dinner on a tray. It was set down on the table beside her and the covers lifted. But what with the dressing and the talking, what with the heat of the room and the agitation of the farewells, Miss Barrett was too tired to eat. She gave a little sigh when she saw the plump mutton chop, or the wing of partridge or chicken that had been sent up for her dinner. So long as Wilson was in the room she fiddled about with her knife and fork. But directly the door was shut and they were alone, she made a sign. She held up her fork. A whole chicken's wing was impaled upon it. Flush advanced. Miss Barrett nodded. Very gently, very cleverly, without spilling a crumb, Flush removed the wing; swallowed it down and left no trace behind. Half a rice pudding clotted with thick cream went the same way. Nothing could have been neater, more effective than Flush's co-operation. He was lying couched as usual at Miss Barrett's feet, apparently asleep, Miss Barrett was lying rested and restored, apparently having made an excellent dinner, when once more a step that was heavier, more deliberate and firmer than any other, stopped on the stair; solemnly a knock sounded that was no tap of enquiry but a demand for admittance; the door opened and in came the blackest, the most formidable of elderly men—Mr. Barrett himself. His eye at once sought the tray. Had the meal been eaten? Had his commands been obeyed? Yes, the plates were empty. Signifying his approval of his daughter's obedience, Mr. Barrett lowered himself heavily into the chair by her side. As that dark body approached him, shivers of terror and horror ran down Flush's spine. So a savage couched in flowers shudders when the thunder growls and he hears the voice of God. Then Wilson whistled; and Flush, slinking guiltily, as if Mr. Barrett could read his thoughts and those thoughts were evil, crept out of the room and rushed downstairs. A force had entered the bedroom which he dreaded; a force that he was powerless to withstand. Once he burst in unexpectedly. Mr. Barrett was on his knees praying by his daughter's side.





Chapter Three The Hooded Man


Such an education as this, in the back bedroom at Wimpole Street, would have told upon an ordinary dog. And Flush was not an ordinary dog. He was high-spirited, yet reflective; canine, but highly sensitive to human emotions also. Upon such a dog the atmosphere of the bedroom told with peculiar force. We cannot blame him if his sensibility was cultivated rather to the detriment of his sterner qualities. Naturally, lying with his head pillowed on a Greek lexicon, he came to dislike barking and biting; he came to prefer the silence of the cat to the robustness of the dog; and human sympathy to either. Miss Barrett, too, did her best to refine and educate his powers still further. Once she took a harp from the window and asked him, as she laid it by his side, whether he thought that the harp, which made music, was itself alive? He looked and listened; pondered, it seemed, for a moment in doubt and then decided that it was not. Then she would make him stand with her in front of the looking-glass and ask him why he barked and trembled. Was not the little brown dog opposite himself? But what is "oneself"? Is it the thing people see? Or is it the thing one is? So Flush pondered that question too, and, unable to solve the problem of reality, pressed closer to Miss Barrett and kissed her "expressively." That was real at any rate.

Fresh from such problems, with such emotional dilemmas agitating his nervous system, he went downstairs, and we cannot be surprised if there was something—a touch of the supercilious, of the superior—in his bearing that roused the rage of Catiline, the savage Cuba bloodhound, so that he set upon him and bit him and sent him howling upstairs to Miss Barrett for sympathy. Flush "is no hero," she concluded; but why was he no hero? Was it not partly on her account? She was too just not to realize that it was for her that he had sacrificed his courage, as it was for her that he had sacrificed the sun and the air. This nervous sensibility had its drawbacks, no doubt—she was full of apologies when he flew at Mr. Kenyon and bit him for stumbling over the bell-pull; it was annoying when he moaned piteously all night because he was not allowed to sleep on her bed—when he refused to eat unless she fed him; but she took the blame and bore the inconvenience because, after all, Flush loved her. He had refused the air and the sun for her sake. "He is worth loving, is he not?" she asked of Mr. Horne. And whatever answer Mr. Horne might give, Miss Barrett was positive of her own. She loved Flush, and Flush was worthy of her love.

It seemed as if nothing were to break that tie—as if the years were merely to compact and cement it; and as if those years were to be all the years of their natural lives. Eighteen-forty-two turned into eighteen-forty-three; eighteen-forty-three into eighteen-forty-four; eighteen-forty-four into eighteen-forty-five. Flush was no longer a puppy; he was a dog of four or five; he was a dog in the full prime of life—and still Miss Barrett lay on her sofa in Wimpole Street and still Flush lay on the sofa at her feet. Miss Barrett's life was the life of "a bird in its cage." She sometimes kept the house for weeks at a time, and when she left it, it was only for an hour or two, to drive to a shop in a carriage, or to be wheeled to Regent's Park in a bath-chair. The Barretts never left London. Mr. Barrett, the seven brothers, the two sisters, the butler, Wilson and the maids, Catiline, Folly, Miss Barrett and Flush all went on living at 50 Wimpole Street, eating in the diningroom, sleeping in the bedrooms, smoking in the study, cooking in the kitchen, carrying hot-water cans and emptying the slops from January to December. The chair-covers became slightly soiled; the carpets slightly worn; coal dust, mud, soot, fog, vapours of cigar smoke and wine and meat accumulated in crevices, in cracks, in fabrics, on the tops of picture-frames, in the scrolls of carvings. And the ivy that hung over Miss Barrett's bedroom window flourished; its green curtain became thicker and thicker, and in summer the nasturtiums and the scarlet runners rioted together in the window-box.

But one night early in January 1845 the postman knocked. Letters fell into the box as usual. Wilson went downstairs to fetch the letters as usual. Everything was as usual—every night the postman knocked, every night Wilson fetched the letters, every night there was a letter for Miss Barrett. But tonight the letter was not the same letter; it was a different letter. Flush saw that, even before the envelope was broken. He knew it from the way that Miss Barrett took it; turned it; looked at the vigorous, jagged writing of her name. He knew it from the indescribable tremor in her fingers, from the impetuosity with which they tore the flap open, from the absorption with which she read. He watched her read. And as she read he heard, as when we are half asleep we hear through the clamour of the street some bell ringing and know that it is addressed to us, alarmingly yet faintly, as if someone far away were trying to rouse us with the warning of fire, or burglary, or some menace against our peace and we start in alarm before we wake—so Flush, as Miss Barrett read the little blotted sheet, heard a bell rousing him from his sleep; warning him of some danger menacing his safety and bidding him sleep no more. Miss Barrett read the letter quickly; she read the letter slowly; she returned it carefully to its envelope. She too slept no more.

Again, a few nights later, there was the same letter on Wilson's tray. Again it was read quickly, read slowly, read over and over again. Then it was put away carefully, not in the drawer with the voluminous sheets of Miss Mitford's letters, but by itself. Now Flush paid the full price of long years of accumulated sensibility lying couched on cushions at Miss Barrett's feet. He could read signs that nobody else could even see. He could tell by the touch of Miss Barrett's fingers that she was waiting for one thing only—for the postman's knock, for the letter on the tray. She would be stroking him perhaps with a light, regular movement; suddenly—there was the rap—her fingers constricted; he would be held in a vice while Wilson came upstairs. Then she took the letter and he was loosed and forgotten.

Yet, he argued, what was there to be afraid of, so long as there was no change in Miss Barrett's life? And there was no change. No new visitors came. Mr. Kenyon came as usual; Miss Mitford came as usual. The brothers and sisters came; and in the evening Mr. Barrett came. They noticed nothing; they suspected nothing. So he would quieten himself and try to believe, when a few nights passed without the envelope, that the enemy had gone. A man in a cloak, he imagined, a cowled and hooded figure, had passed, like a burglar, rattling the door, and finding it guarded, had slunk away defeated. The danger, Flush tried to make himself believe, was over. The man had gone. And then the letter came again.

As the envelopes came more and more regularly, night after night, Flush began to notice signs of change in Miss Barrett herself. For the first time in Flush's experience she was irritable and restless. She could not read and she could not write. She stood at the window and looked out. She questioned Wilson anxiously about the weather—was the wind still in the east? Was there any sign of spring in the Park yet? Oh no, Wilson replied; the wind was a cruel east wind still. And Miss Barrett, Flush felt, was at once relieved and annoyed. She coughed. She complained of feeling ill—but not so ill as she usually felt when the wind was in the east. And then, when she was alone, she read over again last night's letter. It was the longest she had yet had. There were many pages, closely covered, darkly blotted, scattered with strange little abrupt hieroglyphics. So much Flush could see, from his station at her feet. But he could make no sense of the words that Miss Barrett was murmuring to herself. Only he could trace her agitation when she came to the end of the page and read aloud (though unintelligibly), "Do you think I shall see you in two months, three months?"

Then she took up her pen and passed it rapidly and nervously over sheet after sheet. But what did they mean—the little words that Miss Barrett wrote? "April is coming. There will be both a May and a June if we live to see such things, and perhaps, after all, we may ... I will indeed see you when the warm weather has revived me a little... . But I shall be afraid of you at first—though I am not, in writing thus. You are Paracelsus, and I am a recluse, with nerves that have been broken on the rack, and now hang loosely, quivering at a step and breath."

Flush could not read what she was writing an inch or two above his head. But he knew just as well as if he could read every word, how strangely his mistress was agitated as she wrote; what contrary desires shook her—that April might come; that April might not come; that she might see this unknown man at once, that she might never see him at all. Flush, too, quivered as she did at a step, at a breath. And remorselessly the days went on. The wind blew out the blind. The sun whitened the busts. A bird sang in the mews. Men went crying fresh flowers to sell down Wimpole Street. All these sounds meant, he knew, that April was coming and May and June—nothing could stop the approach of that dreadful spring. For what was coming with the spring? Some terror—some horror—something that Miss Barrett dreaded, and that Flush dreaded too. He started now at the sound of a step. But it was only Henrietta. Then there was a knock. It was only Mr. Kenyon. So April passed; and the first twenty days of May. And then, on the 21st of May, Flush knew that the day itself had come. For on Tuesday, the 21st of May, Miss Barrett looked searchingly in the glass; arrayed herself exquisitely in her Indian shawls; bade Wilson draw the armchair close, but not too close; touched this, that and the other; and then sat upright among her pillows. Flush couched himself taut at her feet. They waited, alone together. At last, Marylebone Church clock struck two; they waited. Then Marylebone Church clock struck a single stroke—it was half-past two; and as the single stroke died away, a rap sounded boldly on the front door. Miss Barrett turned pale; she lay very still. Flush lay still too. Upstairs came the dreaded, the inexorable footfall; upstairs, Flush knew, came the cowled and sinister figure of midnight—the hooded man. Now his hand was on the door. The handle spun. There he stood.

"Mr. Browning," said Wilson.

Flush, watching Miss Barrett, saw the colour rush into her face; saw her eyes brighten and her lips open.

"Mr. Browning!" she exclaimed.

Twisting his yellow gloves[3] in his hands, blinking his eyes, well groomed, masterly, abrupt, Mr. Browning strode across the room. He seized Miss Barrett's hand, and sank into the chair by the sofa at her side. Instantly they began to talk.

What was horrible to Flush, as they talked, was his loneliness. Once he had felt that he and Miss Barrett were together, in a firelit cave. Now the cave was no longer firelit; it was dark and damp; Miss Barrett was outside. He looked round him. Everything had changed. The bookcase, the five busts—they were no longer friendly deities presiding approvingly—they were alien, severe. He shifted his position at Miss Barrett's feet. She took no notice. He whined. They did not hear him. At last he lay still in tense and silent agony. The talk went on; but it did not flow and ripple as talk usually flowed and rippled. It leapt and jerked. It stopped and leapt again. Flush had never heard that sound in Miss Barrett's voice before—that vigour, that excitement. Her cheeks were bright as he had never seen them bright; her great eyes blazed as he had never seen them blaze. The clock struck four; and still they talked. Then it struck half-past four. At that Mr. Browning jumped up. A horrid decision, a dreadful boldness marked every movement. In another moment he had wrung Miss Barrett's hand in his; he had taken his hat and gloves; he had said good-bye. They heard him running down the stairs. Smartly the door banged behind him. He was gone.

But Miss Barrett did not sink back in her pillows as she sank back when Mr. Kenyon or Miss Mitford left her. Now she still sat upright; her eyes still burnt; her cheeks still glowed; she seemed still to feel that Mr. Browning was with her. Flush touched her. She recalled him with a start. She patted him lightly, joyfully, on the head. And smiling, she gave him the oddest look—as if she wished that he could talk—as if she expected him too to feel what she felt. And then she laughed, pityingly; as if it were absurd—Flush, poor Flush could feel nothing of what she felt. He could know nothing of what she knew. Never had such wastes of dismal distance separated them. He lay there ignored; he might not have been there, he felt. She no longer remembered his existence.

And that night she ate her chicken to the bone. Not a scrap of potato or of skin was thrown to Flush. When Mr. Barrett came as usual, Flush marvelled at his obtuseness. He sat himself down in the very chair that the man had sat in. His head pressed the same cushions that the man's had pressed, and yet he noticed nothing. "Don't you know," Flush marvelled, "who's been sitting in that chair? Can't you smell him?" For to Flush the whole room still reeked of Mr. Browning's presence. The air dashed past the bookcase, and eddied and curled round the heads of the five pale busts. But the heavy man sat by his daughter in entire self- absorption. He noticed nothing. He suspected nothing. Aghast at his obtuseness, Flush slipped past him out of the room.

But in spite of their astonishing blindness, even Miss Barrett's family began to notice, as the weeks passed, a change in Miss Barrett. She left her room and went down to sit in the drawing-room. Then she did what she had not done for many a long day—she actually walked on her own feet as far as the gate at Devonshire Place with her sister. Her friends, her family, were amazed at her improvement. But only Flush knew where her strength came from—it came from the dark man in the armchair. He came again and again and again. First it was once a week; then it was twice a week. He came always in the afternoon and left in the afternoon. Miss Barrett always saw him alone. And on the days when he did not come, his letters came. And when he himself was gone, his flowers were there. And in the mornings when she was alone, Miss Barrett wrote to him. That dark, taut, abrupt, vigorous man, with his black hair, his red cheeks and his yellow gloves, was everywhere. Naturally, Miss Barrett was better; of course she could walk. Flush himself felt that it was impossible to lie still. Old longings revived; a new restlessness possessed him. Even his sleep was full of dreams. He dreamt as he had not dreamt since the old days at Three Mile Cross—of hares starting from the long grass; of pheasants rocketing up with long tails streaming, of partridges rising with a whirr from the stubble. He dreamt that he was hunting, that he was chasing some spotted spaniel, who fled, who escaped him. He was in Spain; he was in Wales; he was in Berkshire; he was flying before park-keepers' truncheons in Regent's Park. Then he opened his eyes. There were no hares, and no partridges; no whips cracking and no black men crying "Span! Span!" There was only Mr. Browning in the armchair talking to Miss Barrett on the sofa.

Sleep became impossible while that man was there. Flush lay with his eyes wide open, listening. Though he could make no sense of the little words that hurtled over his head from two-thirty to four-thirty sometimes three times a week, he could detect with terrible accuracy that the tone of the words was changing. Miss Barrett's voice had been forced and unnaturally lively at first. Now it had gained a warmth and an ease that he had never heard in it before. And every time the man came, some new sound came into their voices—now they made a grotesque chattering; now they skimmed over him like birds flying widely; now they cooed and clucked, as if they were two birds settled in a nest; and then Miss Barrett's voice, rising again, went soaring and circling in the air; and then Mr. Browning's voice barked out its sharp, harsh clapper of laughter; and then there was only a murmur, a quiet humming sound as the two voices joined together. But as the summer turned to autumn Flush noted, with horrid apprehension, another note. There was a new urgency, a new pressure and energy in the man's voice, at which Miss Barrett, Flush felt, took fright. Her voice fluttered; hesitated; seemed to falter and fade and plead and gasp, as if she were begging for a rest, for a pause, as if she were afraid. Then, the man was silent.

Of him they took but little notice. He might have been a log of wood lying there at Miss Barrett's feet for all the attention Mr. Browning paid him. Sometimes he scrubbed his head in a brisk, spasmodic way, energetically, without sentiment, as he passed him. Whatever that scrub might mean, Flush felt nothing but an intense dislike for Mr. Browning. The very sight of him, so well tailored, so tight, so muscular, screwing his yellow gloves in his hand, set his teeth on edge. Oh! to let them meet sharply, completely in the stuff of his trousers! And yet he dared not. Taking it all in all, that winter—1845- 6—was the most distressing that Flush had ever known.

The winter passed; and spring came round again. Flush could see no end to the affair; and yet just as a river, though it reflects still trees and grazing cows and rooks returning to the tree-tops, moves inevitably to a waterfall, so those days, Flush knew, were moving to catastrophe. Rumours of change hovered in the air. Sometimes he thought that some vast exodus impended. There was that indefinable stir in the house which precedes—could it be possible?—a journey. Boxes were actually dusted, were, incredible as it might seem, opened. Then they were shut again. No, it was not the family that was going to move. The brothers and sisters still went in and out as usual. Mr. Barrett paid his nightly visit, after the man had gone, at his accustomed hour. What was it, then, that was going to happen? for as the summer of 1846 wore on, Flush was positive that a change was coming. He could hear it again in the altered sound of the eternal voices. Miss Barrett's voice, that had been pleading and afraid, lost its faltering note. It rang out with a determination and a boldness that Flush had never heard in it before. If only Mr. Barrett could hear the tone in which she welcomed this usurper, the laugh with which she greeted him, the exclamation with which he took her hand in his! But nobody was in the room with them except Flush. To him the change was of the most galling nature. It was not merely that Miss Barrett was changing towards Mr. Browning—she was changing in every relation—in her feeling towards Flush himself. She treated his advances more brusquely; she cut short his endearments laughingly; she made him feel that there was something petty, silly, affected, in his old affectionate ways. His vanity was exacerbated. His jealousy was inflamed. At last, when July came, he determined to make one violent attempt to regain her favour, and perhaps to oust the newcomer. How to accomplish this double purpose he did not know, and could not plan. But suddenly on the 8th of July his feelings overcame him. He flung himself on Mr. Browning and bit him savagely. At last his teeth met in the immaculate cloth of Mr. Browning's trousers! But the limb inside was hard as iron—Mr. Kenyon's leg had been butter in comparison. Mr. Browning brushed him off with a flick of his hand and went on talking. Neither he nor Miss Barrett seemed to think the attack worthy of attention. Completely foiled, worsted, without a shaft left in his sheath, Flush sank back on his cushions panting with rage and disappointment. But he had misjudged Miss Barrett's insight. When Mr. Browning was gone, she called him to her and inflicted upon him the worst punishment he had ever known. First she slapped his ears—that was nothing; oddly enough the slap was rather to his liking; he would have welcomed another. But then she said in her sober, certain tones that she would never love him again. That shaft went to his heart. All these years they had lived together, shared everything together, and now, for one moment's failure, she would never love him again. Then, as if to make her dismissal complete, she took the flowers that Mr. Browning had brought her and began to put them in water in a vase. It was an act, Flush thought, of calculated and deliberate malice; an act designed to make him feel his own insignificance completely. "This rose is from him," she seemed to say, "and this carnation. Let the red shine by the yellow; and the yellow by the red. And let the green leaf lie there—" And, setting one flower with another, she stood back to gaze at them as if he were before her—the man in the yellow gloves—a mass of brilliant flowers. But even so, even as she pressed the leaves and flowers together, she could not altogether ignore the fixity with which Flush gazed at her. She could not deny that "expression of quite despair on his face." She could not but relent. "At last I said, 'If you are good, Flush, you may come and say that you are sorry,' on which he dashed across the room and, trembling all over, kissed first one of my hands and then another, and put up his paws to be shaken, and looked into my face with such beseeching eyes that you would certainly have forgiven him just as I did." That was her account of the matter to Mr. Browning; and he of course replied: "Oh, poor Flush, do you think I do not love and respect him for his jealous supervision—his slowness to know another, having once known you?" It was easy enough for Mr. Browning to be magnanimous, but that easy magnanimity was perhaps the sharpest thorn that pressed into Flush's side.

Another incident a few days later showed how widely they were separated, who had been so close, how little Flush could now count on Miss Barrett for sympathy. After Mr. Browning had gone one afternoon Miss Barrett decided to drive to Regent's Park with her sister. As they got out at the Park gate the door of the four- wheeler shut on Flush's paw. He "cried piteously" and held it up to Miss Barrett for sympathy. In other days sympathy in abundance would have been lavished upon him for less. But now a detached, a mocking, a critical expression came into her eyes. She laughed at him. She thought he was shamming: " ... no sooner had he touched the grass than he began to run without a thought of it," she wrote. And she commented sarcastically, "Flush always makes the most of his misfortunes—he is of the Byronic school—il se pose en victime." But here Miss Barrett, absorbed in her own emotions, misjudged him completely. If his paw had been broken, still he would have bounded. That dash was his answer to her mockery; I have done with you—that was the meaning he flashed at her as he ran. The flowers smelt bitter to him; the grass burnt his paws; the dust filled his nostrils with disillusion. But he raced—he scampered. "Dogs must be led on chains"—there was the usual placard; there were the park-keepers with their top-hats and their truncheons to enforce it. But "must" no longer had any meaning for him. The chain of love was broken. He would run where he liked; chase partridges; chase spaniels; splash into the middle of dahlia beds; break brilliant, glowing red and yellow roses. Let the park- keepers throw their truncheons if they chose. Let them dash his brains out. Let him fall dead, disembowelled, at Miss Barrett's feet. He cared nothing. But naturally nothing of the kind happened. Nobody pursued him; nobody noticed him. The solitary park-keeper was talking to a nursemaid. At last he returned to Miss Barrett and she absentmindedly slipped the chain over his neck, and led him home.

After two such humiliations the spirit of an ordinary dog, the spirit even of an ordinary human being, might well have been broken. But Flush, for all his softness and silkiness, had eyes that blazed; had passions that leapt not merely in bright flame but sunk and smouldered. He resolved to meet his enemy face to face and alone. No third person should interrupt this final conflict. It should be fought out by the principals themselves. On the afternoon of Tuesday, the 21st of July, therefore, he slipped downstairs and waited in the hall. He had not long to wait. Soon he heard the tramp of the familiar footstep in the street; he heard the familiar rap on the door. Mr. Browning was admitted. Vaguely aware of the impending attack and determined to meet it in the most conciliatory of spirits, Mr. Browning had come provided with a parcel of cakes. There was Flush waiting in the hall. Mr. Browning made, evidently, some well-meant attempt to caress him; perhaps he even went so far as to offer him a cake. The gesture was enough. Flush sprang upon his enemy with unparalleled violence. His teeth once more met in Mr. Browning's trousers. But unfortunately in the excitement of the moment he forgot what was most essential— silence. He barked; he flung himself on Mr. Browning, barking loudly. The sound was sufficient to alarm the household. Wilson rushed downstairs. Wilson beat him soundly. Wilson overpowered him completely. Wilson led him in ignominy away. Ignominy it was—to have attacked Mr. Browning, to have been beaten by Wilson. Mr. Browning had not lifted a finger. Taking his cakes with him, Mr. Browning proceeded unhurt, unmoved, in perfect composure, upstairs, alone to the bedroom. Flush was led away.

After two and a half hours of miserable confinement with parrots and beetles, ferns and saucepans, in the kitchen, Flush was summoned to Miss Barrett's presence. She was lying on the sofa with her sister Arabella beside her. Conscious of the rightness of his cause, Flush went straight to her. But she refused to look at him. He turned to Arabella. She merely said, "Naughty Flush, go away." Wilson was there—the formidable, the implacable Wilson. It was to her that Miss Barrett turned for information. She had beaten him. Wilson said, "because it was right." And, she added, she had only beaten him with her hand. It was upon her evidence that Flush was convicted. The attack, Miss Barrett assumed, had been unprovoked; she credited Mr. Browning with all virtue, with all generosity; Flush had been beaten off by a servant, without a whip, because "it was right." There was no more to be said. Miss Barrett decided against him. "So he lay down on the floor at my feet," she wrote, "looking from under his eyebrows at me." But though Flush might look, Miss Barrett refused even to meet his eyes. There she lay on the sofa; there Flush lay on the floor.

And as he lay there, exiled, on the carpet, he went through one of those whirlpools of tumultuous emotion in which the soul is either dashed upon the rocks and splintered or, finding some tuft of foothold, slowly and painfully pulls itself up, regains dry land, and at last emerges on top of a ruined universe to survey a world created afresh on a different plan. Which was it to be—destruction or reconstruction? That was the question. The outlines only of his dilemma can be traced here; for his debate was silent. Twice Flush had done his utmost to kill his enemy; twice he had failed. And why had he failed, he asked himself? Because he loved Miss Barrett. Looking up at her from under his eyebrows as she lay, severe and silent on the sofa, he knew that he must love her for ever. But things are not simple but complex. If he bit Mr. Browning he bit her too. Hatred is not hatred; hatred is also love. Here Flush shook his ears in an agony of perplexity. He turned uneasily on the floor. Mr. Browning was Miss Barrett—Miss Barrett was Mr. Browning; love is hatred and hatred is love. He stretched himself, whined and raised his head from the floor. The clock struck eight. For three hours and more he had been lying there, tossed from the horn of one dilemma to another.

Even Miss Barrett, severe, cold, implacable as she was, laid down her pen. "Wicked Flush!" she had been writing to Mr. Browning,"... if people like Flush, choose to behave like dogs savagely, they must take the consequences indeed, as dogs usually do! And you, so good and gentle to him! Anyone but you, would have said 'hasty words' at least." Really it would be a good plan, she thought, to buy a muzzle. And then she looked up and saw Flush. Something unusual in his look must have struck her. She paused. She laid down her pen. Once he had roused her with a kiss, and she had thought that he was Pan. He had eaten chicken and rice pudding soaked in cream. He had given up the sunshine for her sake. She called him to her and said she forgave him.

But to be forgiven, as if for a passing whim, to be taken back again on to the sofa as if he had learnt nothing in his anguish on the floor, as if he were the same dog when in fact he differed totally, was impossible. For the moment, exhausted as he was, Flush submitted. A few days later, however, a remarkable scene took place between him and Miss Barrett which showed the depths of his emotions. Mr. Browning had been and gone; Flush was alone with Miss Barrett. Normally he would have leapt on to the sofa at her feet. But now, instead of jumping up as usual and claiming her caress, Flush went to what was now called "Mr. Browning's armchair." Usually the chair was abhorrent to him; it still held the shape of his enemy. But now, such was the battle he had won, such was the charity that suffused him, that he not only looked at the chair but, as he looked, "suddenly fell into a rapture." Miss Barrett, watching him intently, observed this extraordinary portent. Next she saw him turn his eyes towards a table. On that table still lay the packet of Mr. Browning's cakes. He "reminded me that the cakes you left were on the table." They were now old cakes, stale cakes, cakes bereft of any carnal seduction. Flush's meaning was plain. He had refused to eat the cakes when they were fresh, because they were offered by an enemy. He would eat them now that they were stale, because they were offered by an enemy turned to friend, because they were symbols of hatred turned to love. Yes, he signified, he would eat them now. So Miss Barrett rose and took the cakes in her hand. And as she gave them to him she admonished him, "So I explained to him that you had brought them for him, and that he ought to be properly ashamed therefore for his past wickedness, and make up his mind to love you and not bite you for the future—and he was allowed to profit from your goodness to him." As he swallowed down the faded flakes of that distasteful pastry—it was mouldy, it was flyblown, it was sour—Flush solemnly repeated, in his own language, the words she had used—he swore to love Mr. Browning and not bite him for the future.

He was instantly rewarded—not by stale cakes, not by chicken's wings, not by the caresses that were now his, nor by the permission to lie once more on the sofa at Miss Barrett's feet. He was rewarded, spiritually; yet the effects were curiously physical. Like an iron bar corroding and festering and killing all natural life beneath it, hatred had lain all these months across his soul. Now, by the cutting of sharp knives and painful surgery, the iron had been excised. Now the blood ran once more; the nerves shot and tingled; flesh formed; Nature rejoiced, as in spring. Flush heard the birds sing again; he felt the leaves growing on the trees; as he lay on the sofa at Miss Barrett's feet, glory and delight coursed through his veins. He was with them, not against them, now; their hopes, their wishes, their desires were his. Flush could have barked in sympathy with Mr. Browning now. The short, sharp words raised the hackles on his neck. "I need a week of Tuesdays," Mr. Browning cried, "then a month—a year—a life!" I, Flush echoed him, need a month—a year—a life! I need all the things that you both need. We are all three conspirators in the most glorious of causes. We are joined in sympathy. We are joined in hatred. We are joined in defiance of black and beetling tyranny. We are joined in love.—In short, all Flush's hopes now were set upon some dimly apprehended but none the less certainly emerging triumph, upon some glorious victory that was to be theirs in common, when suddenly, without a word of warning, in the midst of civilisation, security and friendship—he was in a shop in Vere Street with Miss Barrett and her sister: it was the morning of Tuesday the 1st of September—Flush was tumbled head over heels into darkness. The doors of a dungeon shut upon him. He was stolen.[4]





Chapter Four Whitechapel


"This morning Arabel and I, and he with us," Miss Barrett wrote, "went in a cab to Vere Street where we had a little business, and he followed us as usual into a shop and out of it again, and was at my heels when I stepped up into the carriage. Having turned, I said 'Flush,' and Arabel looked round for Flush—there was no Flush! He had been caught up in that moment, from under the wheels, do you understand?" Mr. Browning understood perfectly well. Miss Barrett had forgotten the chain; therefore Flush was stolen. Such, in the year 1846, was the law of Wimpole Street and its neighbourhood.

Nothing, it is true, could exceed the apparent solidity and security of Wimpole Street itself. As far as an invalid could walk or a bath- chair could trundle nothing met the eye but an agreeable prospect of four-storeyed houses, plate-glass windows and mahogany doors. Even a carriage and pair, in the course of an afternoon's airing, need not, if the coachman were discreet, leave the limits of decorum and respectability. But if you were not an invalid, if you did not possess a carriage and pair, if you were—and many people were—active and able-bodied and fond of walking, then you might see sights and hear language and smell smells, not a stone's- throw from Wimpole Street, that threw doubts upon the solidity even of Wimpole Street itself. So Mr. Thomas Beames found when about this time he took it into his head to go walking about London. He was surprised; indeed he was shocked. Splendid buildings raised themselves in Westminster, yet just behind them were ruined sheds in which human beings lived herded together above herds of cows—"two in each seven feet of space." He felt that he ought to tell people what he had seen. Yet how could one describe politely a bedroom in which two or three families lived above a cow-shed, when the cow-shed had no ventilation, when the cows were milked and killed and eaten under the bedroom? That was a task, as Mr. Beames found when he came to attempt it, that taxed all the resources of the English language. And yet he felt that he ought to describe what he had seen in the course of an afternoon's walk through some of the most aristocratic parishes in London. The risk of typhus was so great. The rich could not know what dangers they were running. He could not altogether hold his tongue when he found what he did find in Westminster and Paddington and Marylebone. For instance, here was an old mansion formerly belonging to some great nobleman. Relics of marble mantelpieces remained. The rooms were panelled and the banisters were carved, and yet the floors were rotten, the walls dripped with filth; hordes of half-naked men and women had taken up their lodging in the old banqueting-halls. Then he walked on. Here an enterprising builder had pulled down the old family mansion. He had run up a jerry-built tenement house in its place. The rain dripped through the roof and the wind blew through the walls. He saw a child dipping a can into a bright-green stream and asked if they drank that water. Yes, and washed in it too, for the landlord only allowed water to be turned on twice a week. Such sights were the more surprising, because one might come upon them in the most sedate and civilised quarters of London—"the most aristocratic parishes have their share." Behind Miss Barrett's bedroom, for instance, was one of the worst slums in London. Mixed up with that respectability was this filth. But there were certain quarters, of course, which had long been given over to the poor and were left undisturbed. In Whitechapel, or in a triangular space of ground at the bottom of the Tottenham Court Road, poverty and vice and misery had bred and seethed and propagated their kind for centuries without interference. A dense mass of aged buildings in St. Giles's was "wellnigh a penal settlement, a pauper metropolis in itself." Aptly enough, where the poor conglomerated thus, the settlement was called a Rookery. For there human beings swarmed on top of each other as rooks swarm and blacken tree-tops. Only the buildings here were not trees; they were hardly any longer buildings. They were cells of brick intersected by lanes which ran with filth. All day the lanes buzzed with half-dressed human beings; at night there poured back again into the stream the thieves, beggars, and prostitutes who had been plying their trade in the West End. The police could do nothing. No single wayfarer could do anything except hurry through as fast as he could and perhaps drop a hint, as Mr. Beames did, with many quotations, evasions and euphemisms, that all was not quite as it should be. Cholera would come, and perhaps the hint that cholera would give would not be quite so evasive.

But in the summer of 1846 that hint had not yet been given; and the only safe course for those who lived in Wimpole Street and its neighbourhood was to keep strictly within the respectable area and to lead your dog on a chain. If one forgot, as Miss Barrett forgot, one paid the penalty, as Miss Barrett was now to pay it. The terms upon which Wimpole Street lived cheek by jowl with St. Giles's were laid down. St. Giles's stole what St. Giles's could; Wimpole Street paid what Wimpole Street must. Thus Arabel at once "began to comfort me by showing how certain it was that I should recover him for ten pounds at most." Ten pounds, it was reckoned, was about the price that Mr. Taylor would ask for a cocker spaniel. Mr. Taylor was the head of the gang. As soon as a lady in Wimpole Street lost her dog she went to Mr. Taylor; he named his price, and it was paid; or if not, a brown paper parcel was delivered in Wimpole Street a few days later containing the head and paws of the dog. Such, at least, had been the experience of a lady in the neighbourhood who had tried to make terms with Mr. Taylor. But Miss Barrett of course intended to pay. Therefore when she got home she told her brother Henry, and Henry went to see Mr. Taylor that afternoon. He found him "smoking a cigar in a room with pictures"—Mr. Taylor was said to make an income of two or three thousand a year out of the dogs of Wimpole Street—and Mr. Taylor promised that he would confer with his "Society" and that the dog would be returned next day. Vexatious as it was, and especially annoying at a moment when Miss Barrett needed all her money, such were the inevitable consequences of forgetting in 1846 to keep one's dog on a chain.

But for Flush things were very different. Flush, Miss Barrett reflected, "doesn't know that we can recover him"; Flush had never mastered the principles of human society. "All this night he will howl and lament, I know perfectly," Miss Barrett wrote to Mr. Browning on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 1st September. But while Miss Barrett wrote to Mr. Browning, Flush was going through the most terrible experience of his life. He was bewildered in the extreme. One moment he was in Vere Street, among ribbons and laces; the next he was tumbled head over heels into a bag; jolted rapidly across streets, and at length was tumbled out—here. He found himself in complete darkness. He found himself in chillness and dampness. As his giddiness left him he made out a few shapes in a low dark room—broken chairs, a tumbled mattress. Then he was seized and tied tightly by the leg to some obstacle. Something sprawled on the floor—whether beast or human being, he could not tell. Great boots and draggled skirts kept stumbling in and out. Flies buzzed on scraps of old meat that were decaying on the floor. Children crawled out from dark corners and pinched his ears. He whined, and a heavy hand beat him over the head. He cowered down on the few inches of damp brick against the wall. Now he could see that the floor was crowded with animals of different kinds. Dogs tore and worried a festering bone that they had got between them. Their ribs stood out from their coats—they were half famished, dirty, diseased, uncombed, unbrushed; yet all of them, Flush could see, were dogs of the highest breeding, chained dogs, footmen's dogs, like himself.

He lay, not daring even to whimper, hour after hour. Thirst was his worst suffering; but one sip of the thick greenish water that stood in a pail near him disgusted him; he would rather die than drink another. Yet a majestic greyhound was drinking greedily. Whenever the door was kicked open he looked up. Miss Barrett—was it Miss Barrett? Had she come at last? But it was only a hairy ruffian, who kicked them all aside and stumbled to a broken chair upon which he flung himself. Then gradually the darkness thickened. He could scarcely make out what shapes those were, on the floor, on the mattress, on the broken chairs. A stump of candle was stuck on the ledge over the fireplace. A flare burnt in the gutter outside. By its flickering, coarse light Flush could see terrible faces passing outside, leering at the window. Then in they came, until the small crowded room became so crowded that he had to shrink back and lie even closer against the wall. These horrible monsters—some were ragged, others were flaring with paint and feathers—squatted on the floor; hunched themselves over the table. They began to drink; they cursed and struck each other. Out tumbled, from the bags that were dropped on the floor, more dogs—lap dogs, setters, pointers with their collars still on them; and a giant cockatoo that flustered and dashed its way from corner to corner shrieking "Pretty Poll," "Pretty Poll," with an accent that would have terrified its mistress, a widow in Maida Vale. Then the women's bags were opened, and out were tossed on to the table bracelets and rings and brooches such as Flush had seen Miss Barrett wear and Miss Henrietta. The demons pawed and clawed them; cursed and quarrelled over them. The dogs barked. The children shrieked, and the splendid cockatoo—such a bird as Flush had often seen pendant in a Wimpole Street window—shrieked "Pretty Poll! Pretty Poll!" faster and faster until a slipper was thrown at it and it flapped its great yellow-stained dove-grey wings in frenzy. Then the candle toppled over and fell. The room was dark. It grew steadily hotter and hotter; the smell, the heat, were unbearable; Flush's nose burnt; his coat twitched. And still Miss Barrett did not come.

Miss Barrett lay on her sofa in Wimpole Street. She was vexed; she was worried, but she was not seriously alarmed. Of course Flush would suffer; he would whine and bark all night; but it was only a question of a few hours. Mr. Taylor would name his sum; she would pay it; Flush would be returned.

The morning of Wednesday the 2nd September dawned in the rookeries of Whitechapel. The broken windows gradually became smeared with grey. Light fell upon the hairy faces of ruffians lying sprawled upon the floor. Flush woke from a trance that had veiled his eyes and once more realised the truth. This was now the truth—this room, these ruffians, these whining, snapping, tightly tethered dogs, this murk, this dampness. Could it be true that he had been in a shop, with ladies, among ribbons, only yesterday? Was there such a place as Wimpole Street? Was there a room where fresh water sparkled in a purple jar; had he lain on cushions; had he been given a chicken's wing nicely roasted; and had he been torn with rage and jealousy and bitten a man with yellow gloves? The whole of that life and its emotions floated away, dissolved, became unreal.

Here, as the dusty light filtered in, a woman heaved herself off a sack and staggered out to fetch beer. The drinking and the cursing began again. A fat woman held him up by his ears and pinched his ribs, and some odious joke was made about him—there was a roar of laughter as she threw him on the floor again. The door was kicked open and banged to. Whenever that happened he looked up. Was it Wilson? Could it possibly be Mr. Browning? Or Miss Barrett? But no—it was only another thief, another murderer; he cowered back at the mere sight of those draggled skirts, of those hard, horny boots. Once he tried to gnaw a bone that was hurled his way. But his teeth could not meet in stony flesh and the rank smell disgusted him. His thirst increased and he was forced to lap a little of the green water that had been spilt from the pail. But as Wednesday wore on and he became hotter and more parched and still more sore, lying on the broken boards, one thing merged in another. He scarcely noticed what was happening. It was only when the door opened that he raised his head and looked. No, it was not Miss Barrett.

Miss Barrett, lying on the sofa in Wimpole Street, was becoming anxious. There was some hitch in the proceedings. Taylor had promised that he would go down to Whitechapel on Wednesday afternoon and confer with "the Society." Yet Wednesday afternoon, Wednesday evening passed and still Taylor did not come. This could only mean, she supposed, that the price was going to be raised—which was inconvenient enough at the moment. Still, of course, she would have to pay it. "I must have my Flush, you know," she wrote to Mr. Browning. "I can't run any risk and bargain and haggle." So she lay on the sofa writing to Mr. Browning and listening for a knock at the door. But Wilson came up with the letters; Wilson came up with the hot water. It was time for bed and Flush had not come.

Thursday the 3rd of September dawned in Whitechapel. The door opened and shut. The red setter who had been whining all night beside Flush on the floor was hauled off by a ruffian in a moleskin vest—to what fate? Was it better to be killed or to stay here? Which was worse—this life or that death? The racket, the hunger and the thirst, the reeking smells of the place—and once, Flush remembered, he had detested the scent of eau-de-cologne—were fast obliterating any clear image, any single desire. Fragments of old memories began turning in his head. Was that the voice of old Dr. Mitford shouting in the field? Was that Kerenhappock gossiping with the baker at the door? There was a rattling in the room and he thought he heard Miss Mitford tying up a bunch of geraniums. But it was only the wind—for it was stormy to-day—battering at the brown paper in the broken window pane. It was only some drunken voice raving in the gutter. It was only the old hag in the corner mumbling on and on and on as she fried a herring in a pan over a fire. He had been forgotten and deserted. No help was coming. No voice spoke to him—the parrots cried "Pretty Poll, Pretty Poll" and the canaries kept up their senseless cheeping and chirping.

Then again evening darkened the room; the candle was stuck in its saucer; the coarse light flared outside; hordes of sinister men with bags on their backs, of garish women with painted faces, began to shuffle in at the door and to fling themselves down on the broken beds and tables. Another night had folded its blackness over Whitechapel. And the rain dripped steadily through a hole in the roof and drummed into a pail that had been stood to catch it. Miss Barrett had not come.

Thursday dawned in Wimpole Street. There was no sign of Flush—no message from Taylor. Miss Barrett was very much alarmed. She made enquiries. She summoned her brother Henry, and cross- examined him. She found out that he had tricked her. "The archfield" Taylor had come according to his promise the night before. He had stated his terms—six guineas for the Society and half a guinea for himself. But Henry, instead of telling her, had told Mr. Barrett, with the result, of course, that Mr. Barrett had ordered him not to pay, and to conceal the visit from his sister. Miss Barrett was "very vexed and angry". She bade her brother to go at once to Mr. Taylor and pay the money. Henry refused and "talked of Papa". But it was no use talking of Papa, she protested. While they talked of Papa, Flush would be killed. She made up her mind. If Henry would not go, she would go herself: "... if people won't do as I choose, I shall go down tomorrow morning, and bring Flush back with me," she wrote to Mr. Browning.

But Miss Barrett now found that it was easier to say this than to do it. It was almost as difficult for her to go to Flush as for Flush to come to her. All Wimpole Street was against her. The news that Flush was stolen and that Taylor demanded a ransom was now public property. Wimpole Street was determined to make a stand against Whitechapel. Blind Mr. Boyd sent word that in his opinion it would be "an awful sin" to pay the ransom. Her father and her brother were in league against her and were capable of any treachery in the interests of their class. But worst of all—far worse—Mr. Browning himself threw all his weight, all his eloquence, all his learning, all his logic, on the side of Wimpole Street and against Flush. If Miss Barrett gave way to Taylor, he wrote, she was giving way to tyranny; she was giving way to blackmailers; she was increasing the power of evil over right, of wickedness over innocence. If she gave Taylor his demand, "... how will the poor owners fare who have not money enough for their dogs' redemption?" His imagination took fire; he imagined what he would say if Taylor asked him even for five shillings; he would say, "You are responsible for the proceedings of your gang, and you I mark—don't talk nonsense to me about cutting off heads or paws. Be as sure as that I stand here and tell you, I will spend my whole life in putting you down, the nuisance you declare yourself—and by every imaginable means I will be the death of you and as many of your accomplices as I can discover— but you I have discovered and will never lose sight of... . " So Mr. Browning would have replied to Taylor if he had had the good fortune to meet that gentleman. For indeed, he went on, catching a later post with a second letter that same Thursday afternoon, "... it is horrible to fancy how all the oppressors in their several ranks may, if they choose, twitch back to them by the heartstrings after various modes the weak and silent whose secret they have found out." He did not blame Miss Barrett—nothing she did could be anything but perfectly right, perfectly acceptable to him. Still, he continued on Friday morning, "I think it lamentable weakness. ..." If she encouraged Taylor who stole dogs, she encouraged Mr. Barnard Gregory who stole characters. Indirectly, she was responsible for all the wretches who cut their throats or fly the country because some blackmailer like Barnard Gregory took down a directory and blasted their characters. "But why write this string of truisms about the plainest thing in the world?" So Mr. Browning stormed and vociferated from New Cross twice daily.

Lying on her sofa, Miss Barrett read the letters. How easy it could have been to yield—how easy it would have been to say, "Your good opinion is worth more to me than a hundred cocker spaniels." How easy it would have been to sink back on her pillows and sigh, "I am a weak woman; I know nothing of law and justice; decide for me." She had only to refuse to pay the ransom; she had only to defy Taylor and his society. And if Flush were killed, if the dreadful parcel came and she opened it and out dropped his head and paws, there was Robert Browning by her side to assure her that she had done right and earned his respect. But Miss Barrett was not to be intimidated. Miss Barrett took up her pen and refuted Robert Browning. It was all very well, she said, to quote Donne; to cite the case of Gregory; to invent spirited replies to Mr. Taylor—she would have done the same had Taylor struck her; had Gregory defamed her;—would that they had! But what would Mr. Browning have done if the banditti had stolen her; had her in their power; threatened to cut off her ears and send them by post to New Cross? Whatever he would have done, her mind was made up. Flush was helpless. Her duty was to him. "But Flush, poor Flush, who has loved me so faithfully; have I a right to sacrifice him in his innocence, for the sake of any Mr. Taylor's guilt in the world?" Whatever Mr. Browning might say, she was going to rescue Flush, even if she went down into the jaws of Whitechapel to fetch him, even if Robert Browning despised her for doing so.

On Saturday, therefore, with Mr. Browning's letter lying open on the table before her, she began to dress. She read his "one word more—in all this, I labour against the execrable policy of the world's husbands, fathers, brothers and domineerers in general." So, if she went to Whitechapel she was siding against Robert Browning, and in favour of fathers, brothers and domineerers in general. Still, she went on dressing. A dog howled in the mews. It was tied up, helpless in the power of cruel men. It seemed to her to cry as it howled: "Think of Flush." She put on her shoes, her cloak, her hat. She glanced at Mr. Browning's letter once more. "I am about to marry you," she read. Still the dog howled. She left her room and went downstairs.

Henry Barrett met her and told her that in his opinion she might well be robbed and murdered if she did what she threatened. She told Wilson to call a cab. All trembling but submissive, Wilson obeyed. The cab came. Miss Barrett told Wilson to get in. Wilson, though convinced that death awaited her, got in. Miss Barrett told the cabman to drive to Manning Street, Shoreditch. Miss Barrett got in herself and off they drove. Soon they were beyond plate-glass windows, the mahogany doors and the area railings. They were in a world that Miss Barrett had never seen, had never guessed at. They were in a world where cows are herded under the bedroom floor, where whole families sleep in rooms with broken windows; in a world where water is turned on only twice a week, in a world where vice and poverty breed vice and poverty. They had come to a region unknown to respectable cab-drivers. The cab stopped; the driver asked his way at a public-house. "Out came two or three men. 'Oh, you want to find Mr. Taylor, I daresay!'" In this mysterious world a cab with two ladies could only come upon one errand, and that errand was already known. It was sinister in the extreme. One of the men ran into a house, and came out saying that Mr. Taylor "'wasn't at home! but wouldn't I get out?' Wilson, in an aside of terror, entreated me not to think of such a thing." A gang of men and boys pressed round the cab. "Then wouldn't I see Mrs. Taylor?" the man asked. Miss Barrett had no wish whatever to see Mrs. Taylor; but now an immense fat woman came out of the house, "fat enough to have had an easy conscience all her life," and informed Miss Barrett that her husband was out: "might be in in a few minutes, or in so many hours—wouldn't I like to get out and wait?" Wilson tugged at her gown. Imagine waiting in the house of that woman! It was bad enough to sit in the cab with the gang of men and boys pressing round them. So Miss Barrett parleyed with the "immense feminine bandit" from the cab. She said Mr. Taylor had her dog; Mr. Taylor had promised to restore her dog; would Mr. Taylor bring back her dog to Wimpole Street for certain that very day? "Oh yes, certainly," said the fat woman with the most gracious of smiles. She did believe that Taylor had left home precisely on that business. And she "poised her head to right and left with the most easy grace."

So the cab turned round and left Manning Street, Shoreditch. Wilson was of opinion that "we had escaped with our lives barely." Miss Barrett herself had been alarmed. "Plain enough it was that the gang was strong there. The society, the 'Fancy'... had their roots in the ground," she wrote. Her mind teemed with thoughts, her eyes were full of pictures. This, then, was what lay on the other side of Wimpole Street—these faces, these houses. She had seen more while she sat in the cab at the public-house than she had seen during the five years that she had lain in the back bedroom at Wimpole Street. "The faces of those men!" she exclaimed. They were branded on her eyeballs. They stimulated her imagination as "the divine marble presences," the busts on the bookcase, had never stimulated it. Here lived women like herself; while she lay on her sofa, reading, writing, they lived thus. But the cab was now trundling along between four-storeyed houses again. Here were the familiar doors and windows: the avenue of pointed brick, the brass knockers, the regular curtains. Here was Wimpole Street and No.50. Wilson sprang out—with what relief to find herself in safety can be imagined. But Miss Barrett, perhaps, hesitated a moment. She still saw "the faces of those men." They were to come before her again years later when she was sitting on a sunny balcony in Italy.[5] They were to inspire the most vivid passages in Aurora Leigh.But now the butler had opened the door, and she went upstairs to her room again.

Saturday was the fifth day of Flush's imprisonment. Almost exhausted, almost hopeless, he lay panting in his dark corner of the teeming floor. Doors slammed and banged. Rough voices cried. Women screamed. Parrots chattered as they had chattered to widows in Maida Vale, but now evil old women merely cursed at them. Insects crawled in his fur, but he was too weak, too indifferent to shake his coat. All Flush's past life and its many scenes—Reading, the greenhouse, Miss Mitford, Mr. Kenyon, the bookcases, the busts, the peasants on the blind—had faded like snowflakes dissolved in a cauldron. If he still held to hope, it was to something nameless and formless; the featureless face of someone he still called "Miss Barrett". She still existed; all the rest of the world was gone; but she still existed, though such gulfs lay between them that it was impossible, almost, that she should reach him still. Darkness began to fall again, such darkness as seemed almost able to crush out his last hope—Miss Barrett.

In truth, the forces of Wimpole Street were still, even at this last moment, battling to keep Flush and Miss Barrett apart. On Saturday afternoon she lay and waited for Taylor to come, as the immensely fat woman had promised. At last he came, but he had not brought the dog. He sent up a message—Let Miss Barrett pay him six guineas on the spot, and he would go straight to Whitechapel and fetch the dog "on his word of honour". What "the archfiend" Taylor's word of honour might be worth, Miss Barrett could not say; but "there seemed no other way for it"; Flush's life was at stake; she counted out the guineas and sent them down to Taylor in the passage. But as ill luck would have it, as Taylor waited in the passage among the umbrellas, the engravings, the pile carpet and other valuable objects, Alfred Barrett came in. The sight of the archfiend Taylor actually in the house made him lose his temper. He burst into a rage. He called him "a swindler, and a liar and a thief". Thereupon Mr. Taylor cursed him back. What was far worse, he swore that "as he hoped to be saved, we should never see our dog again," and rushed out of the house. Next morning, then, the blood- stained parcel would arrive.

Miss Barrett flung on her clothes again and rushed downstairs. Where was Wilson? Let her call a cab. She was going back to Shoreditch instantly. Her family came running to prevent her. It was getting dark. She was exhausted already. The adventure was risky enough for a man in health. For her it was madness. So they told her. Her brothers, her sisters, all came round her threatening her, dissuading her, "crying out against me for being 'quite mad' and obstinate and wilful—I was called as many names as Mr. Taylor". But she stood her ground. At last they realised the extent of her folly. Whatever the risk might be they must give way to her. Septimus promised if Ba would return to her room "and be in good humour" that he would go to Taylor's himself and pay the money and bring back the dog.

So the dusk of the 5th of September faded into the blackness of night in Whitechapel. The door of the room was once more kicked open. A hairy man hauled Flush by the scruff of his neck out of his corner. Looking up into the hideous face of his old enemy, Flush did not know whether he was being taken to be killed or to be freed. Save for one phantom memory, he did not care. The man stooped. What were those great fingers fumbling at his throat for? Was it a knife or a chain? Stumbling, half blinded, on legs that staggered, Flush was led out into the open air.

In Wimpole Street Miss Barrett could not eat her dinner. Was Flush dead, or was Flush alive? She did not know. At eight o'clock there was a rap on the door; it was the usual letter from Mr. Browning. But as the door opened to admit the letter, something rushed in also;— Flush. He made straight for his purple jar. It was filled three times over; and still he drank. Miss Barrett watched the dazed, bewildered dirty dog, drinking. "He was not so enthusiastic about seeing me as I expected," she remarked. No, there was only one thing in the world he wanted—clean water.

After all, Miss Barrett had but glanced at the faces of those men and she remembered them all her life. Flush had lain at their mercy in their midst for five whole days. Now as he lay on cushions once more, cold water was the only thing that seemed to have any substance, any reality. He drank continually. The old gods of the bedroom— the bookcase, the wardrobe, the busts—seemed to have lost their substance. This room was no longer the whole world; it was only a shelter; only a dell arched over by one trembling dock-leaf in a forest where wild beasts prowled and venomous snakes coiled; where behind every tree lurked a murderer ready to pounce. As he lay dazed and exhausted on the sofa at Miss Barrett's feet the howls of tethered dogs, the screams of birds in terror still sounded in his ears. When the door opened he started, expecting a hairy man with a knife—it was only Mr. Kenyon with a book; it was only Mr. Browning with his yellow gloves. But he shrank away from Mr. Kenyon and Mr. Browning now. He trusted them no longer. Behind those smiling, friendly faces were treachery and cruelty and deceit. Their caresses were hollow. He dreaded even walking with Wilson to the pillar-box. He would not stir without his chain. When they said, "Poor Flush, did the naughty men take you away?" he put up his head and moaned and yelled. A whip cracking sent him bolting down the area-steps into safety. Indoors he crept closer to Miss Barrett on the sofa. She alone had not deserted him. He still kept some faith in her. Gradually some substance returned to her. Exhausted, trembling, dirty and very thin he lay on the sofa at her feet.

As the days passed and the memory of Whitechapel grew fainter, Flush, lying close to Miss Barrett on the sofa, read her feelings more clearly than ever before. They had been parted; now they were together. Indeed they had never been so much akin. Every start she gave, every movement she made, passed through him too. And she seemed now to be perpetually starting and moving. The delivery of a parcel even made her jump. She opened the parcel; with trembling fingers she took out a pair of thick boots. She hid them instantly in the corner of the cupboard. Then she lay down as if nothing had happened; yet something had happened. When they were alone she rose and took a diamond necklace from a drawer. She took out the box that held Mr. Browning's letters. She laid the boots, the necklace and the letters all in a carpet-box together and then—as if she heard a step on the stair— she pushed the box under the bed and lay down hastily, covering herself with her shawl again. Such signs of secrecy and stealth must herald, Flush felt, some approaching crisis. Were they about to fly together? Were they about to escape together from this awful world of dog-stealers and tyrants? Oh, that it were possible! He trembled and whined with excitement; but in her low voice Miss Barrett bade him be quiet, and instantly he was quiet. She was very quiet too. She lay perfectly still on the sofa directly any of her brothers or sisters came in; she lay and talked to Mr. Barrett as she always lay and talked to Mr. Barrett.

But on Saturday, the 12th of September, Miss Barrett did what Flush had never known her do before. She dressed herself as if to go out directly after breakfast. Moreover, as he watched her dress, Flush knew perfectly well from the expression on her face that he was not to go with her. She was bound on secret business of her own. At ten Wilson came into the room. She also was dressed as if for a walk. They went out together; and Flush lay on the sofa and waited for their return. An hour or so later Miss Barrett came back alone. She did not look at him—she seemed to notice nothing. She drew off her gloves and for a moment he saw a gold ring shine on one of the fingers of her left hand. Then he saw her slip the ring from her hand and hide it in the darkness of a drawer. Then she laid herself down as usual on the sofa. He lay by her side scarcely daring to breathe, for whatever had happened, and something had happened, it must at all costs be concealed.

At all costs the life of the bedroom must go on as usual. Yet everything was different. The very movement of the blind as it drew in and out seemed to Flush like a signal. And as the lights and shadows passed over the busts they too seemed to be hinting and beckoning. Everything in the room seemed to be aware of change; to be prepared for some event. And yet all was silent; all was concealed. The brothers and sisters came in and out as usual; Mr. Barrett came as usual in the evening. He looked as usual to see that the chop was finished, the wine drunk. Miss Barrett talked and laughed and gave no sign when anyone was in the room that she was hiding anything. Yet when they were alone she pulled out the box from under the bed and filled it hastily, stealthily, listening as she did so. And the signs of strain were unmistakable. On Sunday the church bells were ringing. "What bells are those?" somebody asked. "Marylebone Church bells," said Miss Henrietta. Miss Barrett, Flush saw, went deadly white. But nobody else noticed anything.

So Monday passed, and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday. Over them all lay a blanket of silence, of eating and talking and lying still on the sofa as usual. Flush, tossing in uneasy sleep, dreamt that they were couched together under ferns and leaves in a vast forest; then the leaves were parted and he woke. It was dark; but in the darkness he saw Wilson come stealthily into the room, and take the box from beneath the bed and quietly carry it outside. This was on Friday night, the 18th of September. All Saturday morning he lay as one lies who knows that at any moment now a handkerchief may drop, a low whistle may sound and the signal will be given for death or for life. He watched Miss Barrett dress herself. At a quarter to four the door opened and Wilson came in. Then the signal was given—Miss Barrett lifted him in her arms. She rose and walked to the door. For a moment they stood looking round the room. There was the sofa and by it Mr. Browning's armchair. There were the busts and the tables. The sun filtered through the ivy leaves and the blind with peasants walking blew gently out. All was as usual. All seemed to expect a million more such moments to come to them; but for Miss Barrett and Flush this was the last. Very quietly Miss Barrett shut the door.

Very quietly they slipped downstairs, past the drawing-room, the library, the dining-room. All looked as they usually looked; smelt as they usually smelt; all were quiet as if sleeping in the hot September afternoon. On the mat in the hall Catiline lay sleeping too. They gained the front door and very quietly turned the handle. A cab was waiting outside.

"To Hodgson's," said Miss Barrett. She spoke almost in a whisper. Flush sat on her knee very still. Not for anything in the whole world would he have broken that tremendous silence.





Chapter Five Italy


Hours, days, weeks, it seemed of darkness and rattling; of sudden lights; and then long tunnels of gloom; of being flung this way and that; of being hastily lifted into the light and seeing Miss Barrett's face close, and thin trees and lines and rails and high light-specked houses—for it was the barbarous custom of railways in those days to make dogs travel in boxes—followed. Yet Flush was not afraid; they were escaping; they were leaving tyrants and dog-stealers behind them. Rattle, grind; grind, rattle as much as you like, he murmured, as the train flung him this way and that; only let us leave Wimpole Street and Whitechapel behind us. At last the light broadened; the rattling stopped. He heard birds singing and the sigh of trees in the wind. Or was it the rush of water? Opening his eyes at last, shaking his coat at last, he saw—the most astonishing sight conceivable. There was Miss Barrett on a rock in the midst of rushing waters. Trees bent over her; the river raced round her. She must be in peril. With one bound Flush splashed through the stream and reached her. "... he is baptized in Petrarch's name," said Miss Barrett as he clambered up on to the rock by her side. For they were at Vaucluse; she had perched herself upon a stone in the middle of Petrarch's fountain.

Then there was more rattling and more grinding; and then again he was stood down on a stable floor; the darkness opened; light poured over him; he found himself alive, awake, bewildered, standing on reddish tiles in a vast bare room flooded with sunshine. He ran hither and thither smelling and touching. There was no carpet and no fireplace. There were no sofas, no armchairs, no bookcases, no busts. Pungent and unfamiliar smells tickled his nostrils and made him sneeze. The light, infinitely sharp and clear, dazzled his eyes. He had never been in a room—if this were indeed a room—that was so hard, so bright, so big, so empty. Miss Barrett looked smaller than ever sitting on a chair by a table in the midst. Then Wilson took him out of doors. He found himself almost blinded, first by the sun, then by the shadow. One half of the street was burning hot; the other bitterly cold. Women went by wrapped in furs, yet they carried parasols to shade their heads. And the street was dry as bone. Though it was now the middle of November there was neither mud nor puddle to wet his paws or clot their feathers. There were no areas and no railings. There was none of that heady confusion of smells that made a walk down Wimpole Street or Oxford Street so distracting. On the other hand, the strange new smells that came from sharp stone corners, from dry yellow walls, were extraordinarily pungent and queer. Then from behind a black swinging curtain came an astonishing sweet smell, wafted in clouds; he stopped, his paws raised, to savour it; he made to follow it inside; he pushed in beneath the curtain. He had one glimpse of a booming light-sprinkled hall, very high and hollow; and then Wilson with a cry of horror, jerked him smartly back. They went on down the street again. The noise of the street was deafening. Everybody seemed to be shouting shrilly at the same moment. Instead of the solid and soporific hum of London there was a rattling and a crying, a jingling and a shouting, a cracking of whips and a jangling of bells. Flush leapt and jumped this way and that, and so did Wilson. They were forced on and off the pavement twenty times, to avoid a cart, a bullock, a troop of soldiers, a drove of goats. He felt younger, spryer than he had done these many years. Dazzled, yet exhilarated, he sank on the reddish tiles and slept more soundly than he had ever slept in the back bedroom at Wimpole Street upon pillows.

But soon Flush became aware of the more profound differences that distinguish Pisa—it was in Pisa that they were now settled—from London. The dogs were different. In London he could scarcely trot round to the pillar-box without meeting some pug dog, retriever, bulldog, mastiff, collie, Newfoundland, St. Bernard, fox terrier or one of the seven famous families of the Spaniel tribe. To each he gave a different name, and to each a different rank. But here in Pisa, though dogs abounded, there were no ranks; all—could it be possible?—were mongrels. As far as he could see, they were dogs merely—grey dogs, yellow dogs, brindled dogs, spotted dogs; but it was impossible to detect a single spaniel, collie, retriever or mastiff among them. Had the Kennel Club, then, no jurisdiction in Italy? Was the Spaniel Club unknown? Was there no law which decreed death to the topknot, which cherished the curled ear, protected the feathered foot, and insisted absolutely that the brow must be domed but not pointed? Apparently not. Flush felt himself like a prince in exile. He was the sole aristocrat among a crowd of canaille. He was the only pure-bred cocker spaniel in the whole of Pisa.

For many years now Flush had been taught to consider himself an aristocrat. The law of the purple jar and of the chain had sunk deep into his soul. It is scarcely surprising that he was thrown off his balance. A Howard or a Cavendish set down among a swarm of natives in mud huts can hardly be blamed if now and again he remembers Chatsworth and muses regretfully over red carpets and galleries daubed with coronets as the sunset blazes down through painted windows. There was an element, it must be admitted, of the snob in Flush; Miss Mitford had detected it years ago; and the sentiment, subdued in London among equals and superiors, returned to him now that he felt himself unique. He became overbearing and impudent. "Flush has grown an absolute monarch and barks one distracted when he wants a door opened," Mrs. Browning wrote. "Robert," she continued, "declares that the said Flush considers him, my husband, to be created for the especial purpose of doing him service, and really it looks rather like it."

"Robert", "my husband"—if Flush had changed, so had Miss Barrett. It was not merely that she called herself Mrs. Browning now; that she flashed the gold ring on her hand in the sun; she was changed, as much as Flush was changed. Flush heard her say, "Robert", "my husband", fifty times a day, and always with a ring of pride that made his hackles rise and his heart jump. But it was not her language only that had changed. She was a different person altogether. Now, for instance, instead of sipping a thimbleful of port and complaining of the headache, she tossed off a tumbler of Chianti and slept the sounder. There was a flowering branch of oranges on the dinner-table instead of one denuded, sour, yellow fruit. Then instead of driving in a barouche landau to Regent's Park she pulled on her thick boots and scrambled over rocks. Instead of sitting in a carriage and rumbling along Oxford Street, they rattled off in a ramshackle fly to the borders of a lake and looked at mountains; and when she was tired she did not hail another cab; she sat on a stone and watched the lizards. She delighted in the sun; she delighted in the cold. She threw pine logs from the Duke's forest on to the fire if it froze. They sat together in the crackling blaze and snuffed up the sharp, aromatic scent. She was never tired of praising Italy at the expense of England. "... our poor English," she exclaimed, "want educating into gladness. They want refining not in the fire but in the sunshine." Here in Italy were freedom and life and the joy that the sun breeds. One never saw men fighting, or heard them swearing; one never saw the Italians drunk;—"the faces of those men" in Shoreditch came again before her eyes. She was always comparing Pisa with London and saying how much she preferred Pisa. In the streets of Pisa pretty women could walk alone; great ladies first emptied their own slops and then went to Court "in a blaze of undeniable glory." Pisa with all its bells, its mongrels, its camels, its pine woods, was infinitely preferable to Wimpole Street and its mahogany doors and its shoulders of mutton. So Mrs. Browning every day, as she tossed off her Chianti and broke another orange from the branch, praised Italy and lamented poor, dull, damp, sunless, joyless, expensive, conventional England.

Wilson, it is true, for a time maintained her British balance. The memory of butlers and basements, of front doors and curtains, was not obliterated from her mind without an effort. She still had the conscience to walk out of a picture gallery "struck back by the indecency of the Venus." And later, when she was allowed, by the kindness of a friend, to peep through a door at the glories of the Grand Ducal Court, she still loyally upheld the superior glory of St. James's. "It ... was all very shabby," she reported, "in comparison with our English Court." But even as she gazed, the superb figure of one of the Grand Duke's bodyguard caught her eye. Her fancy was fired; her judgment reeled; her standards toppled. Lily Wilson fell passionately in love with Signor Righi, the guardsman.[6]

And just as Mrs. Browning was exploring her new freedom and delighting in the discoveries she made, so Flush too was making his discoveries and exploring his freedom. Before they left Pisa—in the spring of 1847 they moved on to Florence—Flush had faced the curious and at first upsetting truth that the laws of the Kennel Club are not universal. He had brought himself to face the fact that light topknots are not necessarily fatal. He had revised his code accordingly. He had acted, at first with some hesitation, upon his new conception of canine society. He was becoming daily more and more democratic. Even in Pisa, Mrs. Browning noticed, " ... he goes out every day and speaks Italian to the little dogs." Now in Florence the last threads of his old fetters fell from him. The moment of liberation came one day in the Cascine. As he raced over the grass "like emeralds" with "the pheasants all alive and flying," Flush suddenly bethought him of Regent's Park and its proclamation: Dogs must be led on chains. Where was "must" now? Where were chains now? Where were park- keepers and truncheons? Gone, with the dog-stealers and Kennel Clubs and Spaniel Clubs of a corrupt aristocracy! Gone with four-wheelers and hansom cabs! with Whitechapel and Shoreditch! He ran, he raced; his coat flashed; his eyes blazed. He was the friend of all the world now. All dogs were his brothers. He had no need of a chain in this new world; he had no need of protection. If Mr. Browning was late in going for his walk—he and Flush were the best of friends now—Flush boldly summoned him. He "stands up before him and barks in the most imperious manner possible," Mrs. Browning observed with some irritation—for her relations with Flush were far less emotional now than in the old days; she no longer needed his red fur and his bright eyes to give her what her own experience lacked; she had found Pan for herself among the vineyards and the olive trees; he was there too beside the pine fire of an evening. So if Mr. Browning loitered, Flush stood up and barked; but if Mr. Browning preferred to stay at home and write, it did not matter. Flush was independent now. The wistarias and the laburnum were flowering over walls; the Judas trees were burning bright in the gardens; the wild tulips were sprinkled in the fields. Why should he wait? Off he ran by himself. He was his own master now. " ... he goes out by himself, and stays hours together," Mrs. Browning wrote; "... knows every street in Florence—will have his own way in everything. I am never frightened at his absence," she added, remembering with a smile those hours of agony in Wimpole Street and the gang waiting to snatch him up under the horses' feet if she forgot his chain in Vere Street. Fear was unknown in Florence; there were no dog-stealers here and, she may have sighed, there were no fathers.

But, to speak candidly, it was not to stare at pictures, to penetrate into dark churches and look up at dim frescoes, that Flush scampered off when the door of Casa Guidi was left open. It was to enjoy something, it was in search of something denied him all these years. Once the hunting horn of Venus had blown its wild music over the Berkshire fields; he had loved Mr. Partridge's dog; she had borne him a child. Now he heard the same voice pealing down the narrow streets of Florence, but more imperiously, more impetuously, after all these years of silence. Now Flush knew what men can never know—love pure, love simple, love entire; love that brings no train of care in its wake; that has no shame; no remorse; that is here, that is gone, as the bee on the flower is here and is gone. Today the flower is a rose, tomorrow a lily; now it is the wild thistle on the moor, now the pouched and portentous orchid of the conservatory. So variously, so carelessly Flush embraced the spotted spaniel down the alley, and the brindled dog and the yellow dog—it did not matter which. To Flush it was all the same. He followed the horn wherever the horn blew and the wind wafted it. Love was all; love was enough. No one blamed him for his escapades. Mr. Browning merely laughed—"Quite disgraceful for a respectable dog like him"—when Flush returned very late at night or early the next morning. And Mrs. Browning laughed too, as Flush flung himself down on the bedroom floor and slept soundly upon the arms of the Guidi family inlaid in scagliola.

For at Casa Guidi the rooms were bare. All those draped objects of his cloistered and secluded days had vanished. The bed was a bed; the wash-stand was a wash-stand. Everything was itself and not another thing. The drawing-room was large and sprinkled with a few old carved chairs of ebony. Over the fire hung a mirror with two cupids to hold the lights. Mrs. Browning herself had discarded her Indian shawls. She wore a cap made of some thin bright silk that her husband liked. Her hair was brushed in a new way. And when the sun had gone down and the shutters had been raised she paced the balcony dressed in thin white muslin. She loved to sit there looking, listening, watching the people in the street.

They had not been long in Florence before one night there was such a shouting and trampling in the street that they ran to the balcony to see what was happening. A vast crowd was surging underneath. They were carrying banners and shouting and singing. All the windows were full of faces; all the balconies were full of figures. The people in the windows were tossing flowers and laurel leaves on to the people in the street; and the people in the street—grave men, gay young women—were kissing each other and raising their babies to the people in the balconies. Mr. and Mrs. Browning leant over the balustrade and clapped and clapped. Banner after banner passed. The torches flashed their light on them. "Liberty" was written on one; "The Union of Italy" on another; and "The Memory of the Martyrs" and "Viva Pio Nono" and "Viva Leopoldo Secondo"—for three and a half hours the banners went by and the people cheered and Mr. and Mrs. Browning stood with six candles burning on the balcony, waving and waving. For some time Flush too, stretched between them with his paws over the sill, did his best to rejoice. But at last—he could not conceal it—he yawned. "He confessed at last that he thought they were rather long about it," Mrs. Browning observed. A weariness, a doubt, a ribaldry possessed him. What was it all for? he asked himself. Who was this Grand Duke and what had he promised? Why were they all so absurdly excited?—for the ardour of Mrs. Browning, waving and waving, as the banners passed, somehow annoyed him. Such enthusiasm for a Grand Duke was exaggerated, he felt. And then, as the Grand Duke passed, he became aware that a little dog had stopped at the door. Seizing his chance when Mrs. Browning was more than usually enthusiastic, he slipped down from the balcony and made off. Through the banners and the crowds he followed her. She fled further and further into the heart of Florence. Far away sounded the shouting; the cheers of the people died down into silence. The lights of the torches were extinguished. Only a star or two shone in the ripples of the Arno where Flush lay with the spotted spaniel by his side, couched in the shell of an old basket on the mud. There tranced in love they lay till the sun rose in the sky. Flush did not return until nine next morning, and Mrs. Browning greeted him rather ironically—he might at least, she thought, have remembered that it was the first anniversary of her wedding day. But she supposed "he had been very much amused." It was true. While she had found an inexplicable satisfaction in the trampling of forty thousand people, in the promises of Grand Dukes and the windy aspirations of banners, Flush infinitely preferred the little dog at the door.

It cannot be doubted that Mrs. Browning and Flush were reaching different conclusions in their voyages of discovery—she a Grand Duke, he a spotted spaniel;—and yet the tie which bound them together was undeniably still binding. No sooner had Flush abolished "must" and raced free through the emerald grass of the Cascine gardens where the pheasants fluttered red and gold, than he felt a check. Once more he was thrown back on his haunches. At first it was nothing—a hint merely—only that Mrs. Browning in the spring of 1849 became busy with her needle. And yet there was something in the sight that gave Flush pause. She was not used to sew. He noted that Wilson moved a bed and she opened a drawer to put white clothes inside it. Raising his head from the tiled floor, he looked, he listened attentively. Was something once more about to happen? He looked anxiously for signs of trunks and packing. Was there to be another flight, another escape? But an escape to what, from what? There is nothing to be afraid of here, he assured Mrs. Browning. They need neither of them worry themselves in Florence about Mr. Taylor and dogs' heads wrapped up in brown paper parcels. Yet he was puzzled. The signs of change, as he read them, did not signify escape. They signified, much more mysteriously, expectance. Something, he felt, as he watched Mrs. Browning so composedly, yet silently and steadfastly, stitching in her low chair, was coming that was inevitable; yet to be dreaded. As the weeks went on, Mrs. Browning scarcely left the house. She seemed, as she sat there, to anticipate some tremendous event. Was she about to encounter somebody, like the ruffian Taylor, and let him rain blows on her alone and unaided? Flush quivered with apprehension at the thought. Certainly she had no intention of running away. No boxes were packed. There was no sign that anybody was about to leave the house—rather there were signs that somebody was coming. In his jealous anxiety Flush scrutinised each new-comer. There were many now—Miss Blagden, Mr. Landor, Hattie Hosmer, Mr. Lytton—ever so many ladies and gentlemen now came to Casa Guidi. Day after day Mrs. Browning sat there in her armchair quietly stitching.

Then one day early in March Mrs. Browning did not appear in the sitting-room at all. Other people came in and out; Mr. Browning and Wilson came in and out; and they came in and out so distractedly that Flush hid himself under the sofa. People were trampling up and down stairs, running and calling in low whispers and muted unfamiliar voices. They were moving upstairs in the bedroom. He crept further and further under the shadow of the sofa. He knew in every fibre of his body that some change was taking place—some awful event was happening. So he had waited, years ago, for the step of the hooded man on the staircase. And at last the door had opened and Miss Barrett had cried "Mr. Browning!" Who was coming now? What hooded man? As the day wore on, he was left completely alone. He lay in the drawingroom without food or drink; a thousand spotted spaniels might have sniffed at the door and he would have shrunk away from them. For as the hours passed he had an overwhelming sense that something was thrusting its way into the house from outside. He peeped out from beneath the flounces. The cupids holding the lights, the ebony chests, the French chairs, all looked thrust asunder; he himself felt as if he were being pushed up against the wall to make room for something that he could not see. Once he saw Mr. Browning, but he was not the same Mr. Browning; once Wilson, but she was changed too—as if they were both seeing the invisible presence that he felt.

At last Wilson, looking very flushed and untidy but triumphant, took him in her arms and carried him upstairs. They entered the bedroom. There was a faint bleating in the shadowed room— something waved on the pillow. It was a live animal. Independently of them all, without the street door being opened, out of herself in the room, alone, Mrs. Browning had become two people. The horrid thing waved and mewed by her side. Torn with rage and jealousy and some deep disgust that he could not hide, Flush struggled himself free and rushed downstairs. Wilson and Mrs. Browning called him back; they tempted him with caresses; they offered him titbits; but it was useless. He cowered away from the disgusting sight, the repulsive presence, wherever there was a shadowy sofa or a dark corner. " ... for a whole fortnight he fell into deep melancholy and was proof against all attentions lavished on him"—so Mrs. Browning, in the midst of all her other distractions, was forced to notice. And when we take, as we must, human minutes and hours and drop them into a dog's mind and see how the minutes swell into hours and the hours into days, we shall not exaggerate if we conclude that Flush's "deep melancholy" lasted six full months by the human clock. Many men and women have forgotten their hates and their loves in less.

But Flush was no longer the unschooled, untrained dog of Wimpole Street days. He had learnt his lesson. Wilson had struck him. He had been forced to swallow cakes that were stale when he might have eaten them fresh; he had sworn to love and not to bite. All this churned in his mind as he lay under the sofa; and at last he issued out. Again he was rewarded. At first, it must be admitted, the reward was insubstantial if not positively disagreeable. The baby was set on his back and Flush had to trot about with the baby pulling his ears. But he submitted with such grace, only turning round, when his ears were pulled, "to kiss the little bare, dimpled feet", that, before three months had passed, this helpless, weak, puling, muling lump had somehow come to prefer him, "on the whole"—so Mrs. Browning said—to other people. And then, strangely enough, Flush found that he returned the baby's affection. Did they not share something in common—did not the baby somehow resemble Flush in many ways? Did they not hold the same views, the same tastes? For instance, in the matter of scenery. To Flush all scenery was insipid. He had never, all these years, learnt to focus his eyes upon mountains. When they took him to Vallombrosa all the splendours of its woods had merely bored him. Now again, when the baby was a few months old, they went on another of those long expeditions in a travelling carriage. The baby lay on his nurse's lap; Flush sat on Mrs. Browning's knee. The carriage went on and on and on, painfully climbing the heights of the Apennines. Mrs. Browning was almost beside herself with delight. She could scarcely tear herself from the window. She could not find words enough in the whole of the English language to express what she felt. "... the exquisite, almost visionary scenery of the Apennines, the wonderful variety of shape and colour, the sudden transitions and vital individuality of those mountains, the chestnut forests dropping by their own weight into the deep ravines, the rocks cloven and clawed by the living torrents, and the hills, hill above hill, piling up their grand existences as if they did it themselves, changing colour in the effort"—the beauty of the Apennines brought words to birth in such numbers that they positively crushed each other out of existence. But the baby and Flush felt none of this stimulus, none of this inadequacy. Both were silent. Flush drew "in his head from the window and didn't consider it worth looking at... . He has a supreme contempt for trees and hills or anything of that kind," Mrs. Browning concluded. The carriage rumbled on. Flush slept and the baby slept. Then at last there were lights and houses and men and women passing the windows. They had entered a village. Instantly Flush was all attention. "... his eyes were starting out of his head with eagerness; he looked east, he looked west, you would conclude that he was taking notes or preparing them." It was the human scene that stirred him, not beauty. Beauty, so it seems at least, had to be crystallised into a green or violet powder and puffed by some celestial syringe down the fringed channels that lay behind his nostrils before it touched Flush's senses; and then it issued not in words, but in a silent rapture. Where Mrs. Browning saw, he smelt; where she wrote, he snuffed.

Here, then, the biographer must perforce come to a pause. Where two or three thousand words are insufficient for what we see—and Mrs. Browning had to admit herself beaten by the Apennines: "Of these things I cannot give you any idea," she admitted—there are no more than two words and perhaps one-half for what we smell. The human nose is practically non-existent. The greatest poets in the world have smelt nothing but roses on the one hand, and dung on the other. The infinite gradations that lie between are unrecorded. Yet it was in the world of smell that Flush mostly lived. Love was chiefly smell; form and colour were smell; music and architecture, law, politics and science were smell. To him religion itself was smell. To describe his simplest experience with the daily chop or biscuit is beyond our power. Not even Mr. Swinburne could have said what the smell of Wimpole Street meant to Flush on a hot afternoon in June. As for describing the smell of a spaniel mixed with the smell of torches, laurels, incense, banners, wax candles and a garland of rose leaves crushed by a satin heel that has been laid up in camphor, perhaps Shakespeare, had he paused in the middle of writing Antony and Cleopatra—But Shakespeare did not pause. Confessing our inadequacy, then, we can but note that to Flush Italy, in these the fullest, the freest, the happiest years of his life, meant mainly a succession of smells. Love, it must be supposed, was gradually losing its appeal. Smell remained. Now that they were established in Casa Guidi again, all had their avocations. Mr. Browning wrote regularly in one room; Mrs. Browning wrote regularly in another. The baby played in the nursery. But Flush wandered off into the streets of Florence to enjoy the rapture of smell. He threaded his path through main streets and back streets, through squares and alleys, by smell. He nosed his way from smell to smell; the rough, the smooth, the dark, the golden. He went in and out, up and down, where they beat brass, where they bake bread, where the women sit combing their hair, where the bird-cages are piled high on the causeway, where the wine spills itself in dark red stains on the pavement, where leather smells and harness and garlic, where cloth is beaten, where vine leaves tremble, where men sit and drink and spit and dice—he ran in and out, always with his nose to the ground, drinking in the essence; or with his nose in the air vibrating with the aroma. He slept in this hot patch of sun—how sun made the stone reek! he sought that tunnel of shade— how acid shade made the stone smell! He devoured whole bunches of ripe grapes largely because of their purple smell; he chewed and spat out whatever tough relic of goat or macaroni the Italian housewife had thrown from the balcony—goat and macaroni were raucous smells, crimson smells. He followed the swooning sweetness of incense into the violet intricacies of dark cathedrals; and, sniffing, tried to lap the gold on the window- stained tomb. Nor was his sense of touch much less acute. He knew Florence in its marmoreal smoothness and in its gritty and cobbled roughness. Hoary folds of drapery, smooth fingers and feet of stone received the lick of his tongue, the quiver of his shivering snout. Upon the infinitely sensitive pads of his feet he took the clear stamp of proud Latin inscriptions. In short, he knew Florence as no human being has ever known it; as Ruskin never knew it or George Eliot either. He knew it as only the dumb know. Not a single one of his myriad sensations ever submitted itself to the deformity of words.

But though it would be pleasant for the biographer to infer that Flush's life in late middle age was an orgy of pleasure transcending all description; to maintain that while the baby day by day picked up a new word and thus removed sensation a little further beyond reach, Flush was fated to remain for ever in a Paradise where essences exist in their utmost purity, and the naked soul of things presses on the naked nerve—it would not be true. Flush lived in no such Paradise. The spirit, ranging from star to star, the bird whose furthest flight over polar snows or tropical forests never brings it within sight of human houses and their curling wood-smoke, may, for anything we know, enjoy such immunity, such integrity of bliss. But Flush had lain upon human knees and heard men's voices. His flesh was veined with human passions; he knew all grades of jealousy, anger and despair. Now in summer he was scourged by fleas.[7] With a cruel irony the sun that ripened the grapes brought also the fleas. "... Savonarola's martyrdom here in Florence," wrote Mrs. Browning, "is scarcely worse than Flush's in the summer." Fleas leapt to life in every corner of the Florentine houses; they skipped and hopped out of every cranny of the old stone; out of every fold of old tapestry; out of every cloak, hat and blanket. They nested in Flush's fur. They bit their way into the thickest of his coat. He scratched and tore. His health suffered; he became morose, thin and feverish. Miss Mitford was appealed to. What remedy was there, Mrs. Browning wrote anxiously, for fleas? Miss Mitford, still sitting in her greenhouse at Three Mile Cross, still writing tragedies, put down her pen and looked up her old prescriptions— what Mayflower had taken, what Rosebud. But the fleas of Reading die at a pinch. The fleas of Florence are red and virile. To them Miss Mitford's powders might well have been snuff. In despair Mr. and Mrs. Browning went down on their knees beside a pail of water and did their best to exorcise the pest with soap and scrubbing-brush. It was in vain. At last one day Mr. Browning, taking Flush for a walk, noticed that people pointed; he heard one man lay a finger to his nose and whisper "La rogna" (mange). As by this time "Robert is as fond of Flush as I am," to take his walk of an afternoon with a friend and to hear him thus stigmatised was intolerable. Robert, his wife wrote, "wouldn't bear it any longer". Only one remedy remained, but it was a remedy that was almost as drastic as the disease itself. However democratic Flush had become and careless of the signs of rank, he still remained what Philip Sidney had called him, a gentleman by birth. He carried his pedigree on his back. His coat meant to him what a gold watch inscribed with the family arms means to an impoverished squire whose broad acres have shrunk to that single circle. It was the coat that Mr. Browning now proposed to sacrifice. He called Flush to him and, "taking a pair of scissors, clipped him all over into the likeness of a lion".

As Robert Browning snipped, as the insignia of a cocker spaniel fell to the floor, as the travesty of quite a different animal rose round his neck, Flush felt himself emasculated, diminished, ashamed. What am I now? he thought, gazing into the glass. And the glass replied with the brutal sincerity of glasses, "You are nothing". He was nobody. Certainly he was no longer a cocker spaniel. But as he gazed, his ears bald now, and uncurled, seemed to twitch. It was as if the potent spirits of truth and laughter were whispering in them. To be nothing—is that not, after all, the most satisfactory state in the whole world? He looked again. There was his ruff. To caricature the pomposity of those who claim that they are something—was that not in its way a career? Anyhow, settle the matter as he might, there could be no doubt that he was free from fleas. He shook his ruff. He danced on his nude, attenuated legs. His spirits rose. So might a great beauty, rising from a bed of sickness and finding her face eternally disfigured, make a bonfire of clothes and cosmetics, and laugh with joy to think that she need never look in the glass again or dread a lover's coolness or a rival's beauty. So might a clergyman, cased for twenty years in starch and broadcloth, cast his collar into the dustbin and snatch the works of Voltaire from the cupboard. So Flush scampered off clipped all over into the likeness of a lion, but free from fleas. "Flush," Mrs. Browning wrote to her sister, "is wise." She was thinking perhaps of the Greek saying that happiness is only to be reached through suffering. The true philosopher is he who has lost his coat but is free from fleas.

But Flush had not long to wait before his newly-won philosophy was put to the test. Again in the summer of 1852 there were signs at Casa Guidi of one of those crises which, gathering soundlessly as a drawer opens or as a piece of string is left dangling from a box, are to a dog as menacing as the clouds which foretell lightning to a shepherd or as the rumours which foretell war to a statesman. Another change was indicated, another journey. Well, what of that? Trunks were hauled down and corded. The baby was carried out in his nurse's arms. Mr. and Mrs. Browning appeared, dressed for travelling. There was a cab at the door. Flush waited philosophically in the hall. When they were ready he was ready. Now that they were all seated in the carriage with one bound Flush sprang lightly in after them. To Venice, to Rome, to Paris—where were they going? All countries were equal to him now; all men were his brothers. He had learnt that lesson at last. But when finally he emerged from obscurity he had need of all his philosophy— he was in London.

Houses spread to right and left in sharp avenues of regular brick. The pavement was cold and hard beneath his feet. And there, issuing from a mahogany door with a brass knocker, was a lady bountifully apparelled in flowing robes of purple plush. A light wreath starred with flowers rested on her hair. Gathering her draperies about her, she glanced disdainfully up and down the street while a footman, stooping, let down the step of the barouche landau. All Welbeck Street—for Welbeck Street it was—was wrapped in a splendour of red light—a light not clear and fierce like the Italian light, but tawny and troubled with the dust of a million wheels, with the trampling of a million hooves. The London season was at its height. A pall of sound, a cloud of interwoven humming, fell over the city in one confluent growl. By came a majestic deerhound led on a chain by a page. A policeman swinging past with rhythmical stride, cast his bull's-eye from side to side. Odours of stew, odours of beef, odours of basting, odours of beef and cabbage rose from a thousand basements. A flunkey in livery dropped a letter into a box.

Overcome by the magnificence of the metropolis, Flush paused for a moment with his foot on the doorstep. Wilson paused too. How paltry it seemed now, the civilisation of Italy, its Courts and its revolutions, its Grand Dukes and their bodyguards! She thanked God, as the policeman passed, that she had not married Signor Righi after all. And then a sinister figure issued from the public-house at the corner. A man leered. With one spring Flush bolted indoors.

For some weeks now he was closely confined to a lodging-house sitting-room in Welbeck Street. For confinement was still necessary. The cholera had come, and it is true that the cholera had done something to improve the condition of the Rookeries; but not enough, for still dogs were stolen and the dogs of Wimpole Street had still to be led on chains. Flush went into society, of course. He met dogs at the pillar-box and outside the public-house; and they welcomed him back with the inherent good breeding of their kind. Just as an English peer who has lived a lifetime in the East and contracted some of the habits of the natives—rumour hints indeed that he has turned Moslem and had a son by a Chinese washerwoman—finds, when he takes his place at Court, that old friends are ready enough to overlook these aberrations and he is asked to Chatsworth, though no mention is made of his wife and it is taken for granted that he will join the family at prayers—so the pointers and setters of Wimpole Street welcomed Flush among them and overlooked the condition of his coat. But there was a certain morbidity, it seemed to Flush now, among the dogs of London. It was common knowledge that Mrs. Carlyle's dog Nero had leapt from a top storey window with the intention of committing suicide[8] He had found the strain of life in Cheyne Row intolerable, it was said. Indeed Flush could well believe it now that he was back again in Welbeck Street. The confinement, the crowd of little objects, the black-beetles by night, the bluebottles by day, the lingering odours of mutton, the perpetual presence on the sideboard of bananas—all this, together with the proximity of several men and women, heavily dressed and not often or indeed completely washed, wrought on his temper and strained his nerves. He lay for hours under the lodging- house chiffonier. It was impossible to run out of doors. The front door was always locked. He had to wait for somebody to lead him on a chain.

Two incidents alone broke the monotony of the weeks he spent in London. One day late that summer the Brownings went to visit the Rev. Charles Kingsley at Farnham. In Italy the earth would have been bare and hard as brick. Fleas would have been rampant. Languidly one would have dragged oneself from shadow to shadow, grateful even for the bar of shade cast by the raised arm of one of Donatello's statues. But here at Farnham there were fields of green grass; there were pools of blue water; there were woods that murmured, and turf so fine that the paws bounced as they touched it. The Brownings and the Kingsleys spent the day together. And once more, as Flush trotted behind them, the old trumpets blew; the old ecstasy returned—was it hare or was it fox? Flush tore over the heaths of Surrey as he had not run since the old days at Three Mile Cross. A pheasant went rocketing up in a spurt of purple and gold. He had almost shut his teeth on the tail feathers when a voice rang out. A whip cracked. Was it the Rev. Charles Kingsley who called him sharply to heel? At any rate he ran no more. The woods of Farnham were strictly preserved.

A few days later he was lying in the sitting-room at Welbeck Street, when Mrs. Browning came in dressed for walking and called him from under the chiffonier. She slipped the chain on to his collar and, for the first time since September 1846, they walked up Wimpole Street together. When they came to the door of No.50 they stopped as of old. Just as of old they waited. The butler just as of old was very slow in coming. At length the door opened. Could that be Catiline lying couched on the mat? The old toothless dog yawned and stretched himself and took no notice. Upstairs they crept as stealthily, as silently as once before they had come down. Very quietly, opening the doors as if she were afraid of what she might see there, Mrs. Browning went from room to room. A gloom descended upon her as she looked." ... they seemed to me," she wrote, "smaller and darker, somehow, and the furniture wanted fitness and convenience." The ivy was still tapping on the back bedroom window-pane. The painted blind still obscured the houses. Nothing had been changed. Nothing had happened all these years. So she went from room to room, sadly remembering. But long before she had finished her inspection, Flush was in a fever of anxiety. Suppose Mr. Barrett were to come in and find them? Suppose that with one frown, with one stare, he turned the key and locked them in the back bedroom for ever? At last Mrs. Browning shut the doors and went downstairs again very quietly. Yes, she said, it seemed to her that the house wanted cleaning.

After that, Flush had only one wish left in him—to leave London, to leave England for ever. He was not happy until he found himself on the deck of the Channel steamer crossing to France. It was a rough passage. The crossing took eight hours. As the steamer tossed and wallowed, Flush turned over in his mind a tumult of mixed memories—of ladies in purple plush, of ragged men with bags; of Regent's Park, and Queen Victoria sweeping past with outriders; of the greenness of English grass and the rankness of English pavements— all this passed through his mind as he lay on deck; and, looking up, he caught sight of a stern, tall man leaning over the rail.

"Mr. Carlyle!" he heard Mrs. Browning exclaim; whereupon—the crossing, it must be remembered, was a bad one—Flush was violently sick. Sailors came running with pails and mops. " ... he was ordered off the deck on purpose, poor dog," said Mrs. Browning. For the deck was still English; dogs must not be sick on decks. Such was his last salute to the shores of his native land.





Chapter Six The End


Flush was growing an old dog now. The journey to England and all the memories it revived had undoubtedly tired him. It was noticed that he sought the shade rather than the sun on his return, though the shade of Florence was hotter than the sun of Wimpole Street. Stretched beneath a statue, couched under the lip of a fountain for the sake of the few drops that spurted now and again on to his coat, he would lie dozing by the hour. The young dogs would come about him. To them he would tell his stories of Whitechapel and Wimpole Street; he would describe the smell of clover and the smell of Oxford Street; he would rehearse his memories of one revolution and another—how Grand Dukes had come and Grand Dukes had gone; but the spotted spaniel down the alley on the left—she goes on for ever, he would say. Then violent Mr. Landor would hurry by and shake his fist at him in mock fury; kind Miss Isa Blagden would pause and take a sugared biscuit from her reticule. The peasant women in the marketplace made him a bed of leaves in the shadow of their baskets and tossed him a bunch of grapes now and then. He was known, he was liked by all Florence— gentle and simple, dogs and men.

But he was growing an old dog now, and he tended more and more to lie not even under the fountain—for the cobbles were too hard for his old bones—but in Mrs. Browning's bedroom where the arms of the Guidi family made a smooth patch of scagliola on the floor, or in the drawing-room under the shadow of the drawing-room table. One day shortly after his return from London he was stretched there fast asleep. The deep and dreamless sleep of old age was heavy on him. Indeed today his sleep was deeper even than usual, for as he slept the darkness seemed to thicken round him. If he dreamt at all, he dreamt that he was sleeping in the heart of a primeval forest, shut from the light of the sun, shut from the voices of mankind, though now and again as he slept he dreamt that he heard the sleepy chirp of a dreaming bird, or, as the wind tossed the branches, the mellow chuckle of a brooding monkey.

Then suddenly the branches parted; the light broke in—here, there, in dazzling shafts. Monkeys chattered; birds rose crying and calling in alarm. He started to his feet wide awake. An astonishing commotion was all round him. He had fallen asleep between the bare legs of an ordinary drawing-room table. Now he was hemmed in by the billowing of skirts and the heaving of trousers. The table itself, moreover, was swaying violently from side to side. He did not know which way to run. What on earth was happening? What in Heaven's name possessed the drawing-room table? He lifted up his voice in a prolonged howl of interrogation.

To Flush's question no satisfactory answer can here be given. A few facts, and those of the baldest, are all that can be supplied. Briefly, then, it would appear that early in the nineteenth century the Countess of Blessington had bought a crystal ball from a magician. Her ladyship "never could understand the use of it"; indeed she had never been able to see anything in the ball except crystal. After her death, however, there was a sale of her effects and the ball came into the possession of others who "looked deeper, or with purer eyes", and saw other things in the ball besides crystal. Whether Lord Stanhope was the purchaser, whether it was he who looked "with purer eyes", is not stated. But certainly by the year 1852 Lord Stanhope was in possession of a crystal ball and Lord Stanhope had only to look into it to see among other things "the spirits of the sun". Obviously this was not a sight that a hospitable nobleman could keep to himself, and Lord Stanhope was in the habit of displaying his ball at luncheon parties and of inviting his friends to see the spirits of the sun also. There was something strangely delightful—except indeed to Mr. Chorley—in the spectacle; balls became the rage; and luckily a London optician soon discovered that he could make them, without being either an Egyptian or a magician, though naturally the price of English crystal was high. Thus many people in the early' fifties became possessed of balls, though "many persons", Lord Stanhope said, "use the balls, without the moral courage to confess it." The prevalence of spirits in London indeed became so marked that some alarm was felt; and Lord Stanley suggested to Sir Edward Lytton "that the Government should appoint a committee of investigation so as to get as far as possible at the facts". Whether the rumour of an approaching Government committee alarmed the spirits, or whether spirits, like bodies, tend to multiply in close confinement, there can be no doubt that the spirits began to show signs of restlessness, and, escaping in vast numbers, took up their residence in the legs of tables. Whatever the motive, the policy was successful. Crystal balls were expensive; almost everybody owns a table. Thus when Mrs. Browning returned to Italy in the winter of 1852 she found that the spirits had preceded her; the tables of Florence were almost universally infected. "From the Legation to the English chemists", she wrote, "people are 'serving tables' ... everywhere. When people gather round a table it isn't to play whist." No, it was to decipher messages conveyed by the legs of tables. Thus if asked the age of a child, the table "expresses itself intelligently by knocking with its legs, responses according to the alphabet". And if a table could tell you that your own child was four years old, what limit was there to its capacity? Spinning tables were advertised in shops. The walls were placarded with advertisements of wonders "scoperte a Livorno".By the year 1854, so rapidly did the movement spread, "four hundred thousand families in America had given their names ... as actually in enjoyment of spiritual intercourse". And from England the news came that Sir Edward BulwerLytton had imported "several of the American rapping spirits" to Knebworth, with the happy result—so little Arthur Russell was informed when he beheld a "strange-looking old gentleman in a shabby dressing-gown" staring at him at breakfast— that Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton believed himself invisible."[9]

When Mrs. Browning first looked into Lord Stanhope's crystal ball at a luncheon party she saw nothing—except indeed that it was a remarkable sign of the times. The spirit of the sun indeed told her that she was about to go to Rome; but as she was not about to go to Rome, she contradicted the spirits of the sun. "But," she added, with truth, "I love the marvellous." She was nothing if not adventurous. She had gone to Manning Street at the risk of her life. She had discovered a world that she had never dreamt of within half an hour's drive from Wimpole Street. Why should there not be another world only half a moment's flight from Florence—a better world, a more beautiful world, where the dead live, trying in vain to reach us? At any rate she would take the risk. And so she sat herself down at the table too. And Mr. Lytton, the brilliant son of an invisible father, came; and Mr. Frederick Tennyson, and Mr. Powers and M. Vili ari—they all sat at the table and then when the table had done kicking, they sat on drinking tea and eating strawberries and cream, with "Florence dissolving in the purple of the hills and the stars looking on", talking and talking: "... what stories we told, and what miracles we swore to! Oh, we are believers here, Isa, except Robert. ... " Then in burst deaf Mr. Kirkup with his bleak white beard. He had come round simply to exclaim, "There is a spiritual world—there is a future state. I confess it. I am convinced at last." And when Mr. Kirkup, whose creed had always been "the next thing to atheism", was converted merely because, in spite of his deafness, he had heard "three taps so loud that they made him leap", how could Mrs. Browning keep her hands off the table? "You know I am rather a visionary and inclined to knock round at all the doors of the present world to try to get out", she wrote. So she summoned the faithful to Casa Guidi; and there they sat with their hands on the drawing-room table, trying to get out.

Flush started up in the wildest apprehension. The skirts and the trousers were billowing round him; the table was standing on one leg. But whatever the ladies and gentlemen round the table could hear and see, Flush could hear and see nothing. True, the table was standing on one leg, but so tables will if you lean hard on one side. He had upset tables himself and been well scolded for it. But now there was Mrs. Browning with her great eyes wide open staring as if she saw something marvellous outside. Flush rushed to the balcony and looked over. Was there another Grand Duke riding by with banners and torches? Flush could see nothing but an old beggar woman crouched at the corner of the street over her basket of melons. Yet clearly Mrs. Browning saw something; clearly she saw something that was very wonderful. So in the old Wimpole Street days she had wept once without any reason that he could see; and again she had laughed, holding up a blotted scrawl. But this was different. There was something in her look now that frightened him. There was something in the room, or in the table, or in the petticoats and trousers, that he disliked exceedingly.

As the weeks passed, this preoccupation of Mrs. Browning's with the invisible grew upon her. It might be a fine hot day, but instead of watching the lizards slide in and out of the stones, she would sit at the table; it might be a dark starry night, but instead of reading in her book, or passing her hand over paper, she would call, if Mr. Browning were out, for Wilson, and Wilson would come yawning. Then they would sit at the table together until that article of furniture, whose chief function it was to provide shade, kicked on the floor, and Mrs. Browning exclaimed that it was telling Wilson that she would soon be ill. Wilson replied that she was only sleepy. But soon Wilson herself, the implacable, the upright, the British, screamed and went into a faint, and Mrs. Browning was rushing hither and thither to find "the hygienic vinegar". That, to Flush, was a highly unpleasant way of spending a quiet evening. Better far to sit and read one's book.

Undoubtedly the suspense, the intangible but disagreeable odour, the kicks and the screams and the vinegar, told upon Flush's nerves. It was all very well for the baby, Penini, to pray "that Flush's hair may grow"; that was an aspiration that Flush could understand. But this form of prayer which required the presence of evil-smelling, seedy- looking men and the antics of a piece of apparently solid mahogany, angered him much as they angered that robust, sensible, well-dressed man, his master. But far worse than any smell to Flush, far worse than any antics, was the look on Mrs. Browning's face when she gazed out of the window as if she were seeing something that was wonderful when there was nothing. Flush stood himself in front of her. She looked through him as if he were not there. That was the cruellest look she had ever given him. It was worse than her cold anger when he bit Mr. Browning in the leg; worse than her sardonic laughter when the door shut upon his paw in Regent's Park. There were moments indeed when he regretted Wimpole Street and its tables. The tables at No. 50 had never tilted upon one leg. The little table with the ring round it that held her precious ornaments had always stood perfectly still. In those far-off days he had only to leap on her sofa and Miss Barrett started wide-awake and looked at him. Now, once more, he leapt on to her sofa. But she did not notice him. She was writing. She paid no attention to him. She went on writing—"also, at the request of the medium, the spiritual hands took from the table a garland which lay there, and placed it upon my head. The particular hand which did this was of the largest human size, as white as snow, and very beautiful. It was as near to me as this hand I write with, and I saw it as distinctly." Flush pawed her sharply. She looked through him as if he were invisible. He leapt off the sofa and ran downstairs into the street.

It was a blazing hot afternoon. The old beggar woman at the corner had fallen asleep over her melons. The sun seemed droning in the air. Keeping to the shady side of the street, Flush trotted along the well-known ways to the market-place. The whole square was brilliant with awnings and stalls and bright umbrellas. The market women were sitting beside baskets of fruit; pigeons were fluttering, bells were pealing, whips were cracking. The many- coloured mongrels of Florence were running in and out sniffing and pawing. All was as brisk as a beehive and as hot as an oven. Flush sought the shade. He flung himself down beside his friend Catterina, under the shadow of her great basket. A brown jar of red and yellow flowers cast a shadow beside it. Above them a statue, holding his right arm outstretched, deepened the shade to violet. Flush lay there in the cool, watching the young dogs busy with their own affairs. They were snarling and biting, stretching and tumbling, in all the abandonment of youthful joy. They were chasing each other in and out, round and round, as he had once chased the spotted spaniel in the alley. His thoughts turned to Reading for a moment—to Mr. Partridge's spaniel, to his first love, to the ecstasies and innocences of youth. Well, he had had his day. He did not grudge them theirs. He had found the world a pleasant place to live in. He had no quarrel with it now. The market woman scratched him behind the ear. She had often cuffed him for stealing a grape, or for some other misdemeanour; but he was old now; and she was old. He guarded her melons and she scratched his ear. So she knitted and he dozed. The flies buzzed on the great pink melon that had been sliced open to show its flesh.

The sun burnt deliciously through the lily leaves, and through the green and white umbrella. The marble statue tempered its heat to a champagne freshness. Flush lay and let it burn through his fur to the naked skin. And when he was roasted on one side he turned over and let the sun roast the other. All the time the market people were chattering and bargaining; market women were passing; they were stopping and fingering the vegetables and the fruit. There was a perpetual buzz and hum of human voices such as Flush loved to listen to. After a time he drowsed off under the shadow of the lilies. He slept as dogs sleep when they are dreaming. Now his legs twitched—was he dreaming that he hunted rabbits in Spain? Was he coursing up a hot hill-side with dark men shouting "Span! Span!" as the rabbits darted from the brushwood? Then he lay still again. And now he yelped, quickly, softly, many times in succession. Perhaps he heard Dr. Mitford egging his greyhounds on to the hunt at Reading. Then his tail wagged sheepishly. Did he hear old Miss Mitford cry, "Bad dog! Bad dog!" as he slunk back to her, where she stood among the turnips waving her umbrella? And then he lay for a time snoring, wrapt in the deep sleep of happy old age. Suddenly every muscle in his body twitched. He woke with a violent start. Where did he think he was? In Whitechapel among the ruffians? Was the knife at his throat again?

Whatever it was, he woke from his dream in a state of terror. He made off as if he were flying to safety, as if he were seeking refuge. The market women laughed and pelted him with rotten grapes and called him back. He took no notice. Cart-wheels almost crushed him as he darted through the streets—the men standing up to drive cursed him and flicked him with their whips. Half-naked children threw pebbles at him and shouted "Matta! Matta!" as he fled past. Their mothers ran to the door and caught them back in alarm. Had he then gone mad? Had the sun turned his brain? Or had he once more heard the hunting horn of Venus? Or had one of the American rapping spirits, one of the spirits that live in table legs, got possession of him at last? Whatever it was, he went in a bee-line up one street and down another until he reached the door of Casa Guidi. He made his way straight upstairs and went straight into the drawing-room.

Mrs. Browning was lying, reading, on the sofa. She looked up, startled, as he came in. It was not a spirit—it was only Flush. She laughed. Then, as he leapt on to the sofa and thrust his face into hers, the words of her own poem came into her mind:





You see this dog. It was but yesterday

I mused forgetful of his presence here

Till thought on thought drew downward tear on tear,

When from the pillow, where wet-cheeked I lay,

A head as hairy as Faunus, thrust its way

Right sudden against my face,—two golden-clear

Great eyes astonished mine,—a drooping ear

Did flap me on either cheek to dry the spray!

I started first, as some Arcadian,

Amazed by goatly god in twilight grove;

But, as the bearded vision closelier ran

My tears off, I knew Flush, and rose above

Surprise and sadness,—thanking the true Pan,

Who, by low creatures, leads to heights of love.





She had written that poem one day years ago in Wimpole Street when she was very unhappy. Years had passed; now she was happy. She was growing old now and so was Flush. She bent down over him for a moment. Her face with its wide mouth and its great eyes and its heavy curls was still oddly like his. Broken asunder, yet made in the same mould, each, perhaps, completed what was dormant in the other. But she was woman; he was dog. Mrs. Browning went on reading. Then she looked at Flush again. But he did not look at her. An extraordinary change had come over him. "Flush!" she cried. But he was silent. He had been alive; he was now dead.[10] That was all. The drawing-room table, strangely enough, stood perfectly still.

[1]"painted fabric." Miss Barrett says, "I had a transparent blind put up in my open window." She adds, "papa insults me with the analogy of a back window in a confectioner's shop, but is obviously moved when the sunshine lights up the castle, notwithstanding." Some hold that the castle, etc., was painted on a thin metallic substance; others that it was a muslin blind richly embroidered. There seems no certain way of settling the matter.

[2]"Mr. Kenyon mumbled slightly because he had lost two front teeth." There are elements of exaggeration and conjecture here. Miss Mitford is the authority. She is reported to have said in conversation with Mr. Horne, "Our dear friend, you are aware, never sees anybody but the members of her own family, and one or two others. She has a high opinion of the skill in reading as well as the fine taste, of Mr.—,and she gets him to read her new poems aloud to her. ... So Mr.—stands upon the hearth-rug, and uplifts the Ms., and his voice, while our dear friend lies folded up in Indian shawls upon her sofa, with her long black tresses streaming over her bent- down head, all attention. Now, dear Mr.—has lost a front tooth—not quite a front one, but a side front one—and this, you see, causes a defective utterance ... an amiable indistinctness, a vague softening of syllables into each other, so that silence and ilence would really sound very like one another. ..." There can be little doubt that Mr.—was Mr. Kenyon; the blank was necessitated by the peculiar delicacy of the Victorians with regard to teeth. But more important questions affecting English literature are involved. Miss Barrett has long been accused of a defective ear. Miss Mitford maintains that Mr. Kenyon should rather be accused of defective teeth. On the other hand, Miss Barrett herself maintained that her rhymes had nothing to do with his lack of teeth or with her lack of ear. "A great deal of attention," she wrote, "—far more than it would have taken to rhyme with complete accuracy—have I given to the subject of rhymes and have determined in cold blood to hazard some experiments." Hence she rhymed "angels" with "candles," "heaven" with "unbelieving," and "islands" with "silence"—in cold blood. It is of course for the professors to decide; but anybody who has studied Mrs. Browning's character and her actions will be inclined to take the view that she was a wilful breaker of rules whether of art or of love, and so to convict her of some complicity in the development of modern poetry.

[3]"yellow gloves." It is recorded in Mrs. Orr's Life of Browning that he wore lemon-coloured gloves. Mrs. Bridell-Fox, meeting him in 1835-6, says, "he was then slim and dark, and very handsome, and— may I hint it—just a trifle of a dandy, addicted to lemon-coloured kid gloves and such things."

[4]"He was stolen." As a matter of fact, Flush was stolen three times; but the unities seem to require that the three stealings shall be compressed into one. The total sum paid by Miss Barrett to the dog- stealers was £20.

[5]"The faces of those men were to come back to her on a sunny balcony in Italy." Readers of Aurora Leigh—but since such persons are nonexistent it must be explained that Mrs. Browning wrote a poem of this name, one of the most vivid passages in which (though it suffers from the distortion natural to an artist who sees the object once only from a four-wheeler, with Wilson tugging at her skirts) is the description of a London slum. Clearly Mrs. Browning possessed a fund of curiosity as to human life which was by no means satisfied by the busts of Homer and Chaucer on the washing- stand in the bedroom.

[6]"Lily Wilson fell in love with Signor Righi, the guardsman." The life of Lily Wilson is extremely obscure and thus cries aloud for the services of a biographer. No human figure in the Browning letters, save the principals, more excites our curiosity and baffles it. Her Christian name was Lily, her surname Wilson. That is all we know of her birth and upbringing. Whether she was the daughter of a farmer in the neighbourhood of Hope End, and became favourably known to the Barrett cook by the decency of her demeanour and the cleanliness of her apron, so much so that when she came up to the great house on some errand, Mrs. Barrett made an excuse to come into the room just then and thought so well of her that she appointed her to be Miss Elizabeth's maid; or whether she was a Cockney; or whether she was from Scotland—it is impossible to say. At any rate she was in service with Miss Barrett in the year 1846. She was "an expensive servant"—her wages were £16 a year. Since she spoke almost as seldom as Flush, the outlines of her character are little known; and since Miss Barrett never wrote a poem about her, her appearance is far less familiar than his. Yet it is clear from indications in the letters that she was in the beginning one of those demure, almost inhumanly correct British maids who were at that time the glory of the British basement. It is obvious that Wilson was a stickler for rights and ceremonies. Wilson undoubtedly revered "the room"; Wilson would have been the first to insist that under servants must eat their pudding in one place, upper servants in another. All this is implicit in the remark she made when she beat Flush with her hand "because it is right." Such respect for convention, it need hardly be said, breeds extreme horror of any breach of it; so that when Wilson was confronted with the lower orders in Manning Street she was far more alarmed, and far more certain that the dog-stealers were murderers, than Miss Barrett was. At the same time the heroic way in which she overcame her terror and went with Miss Barrett in the cab shows how deeply the other convention of loyalty to her mistress was ingrained in her. Where Miss Barrett went, Wilson must go too. This principle was triumphantly demonstrated by her conduct at the time of the elopement. Miss Barrett had been doubtful of Wilson's courage; but her doubts were unfounded. "Wilson," she wrote—and these were the last words she ever wrote to Mr. Browning as Miss Barrett—"has been perfect to me. And I.. . calling her 'timid' and afraid of her timidity! I begin to think that none are so bold as the timid, when they are fairly roused." It is worth, parenthetically, dwelling for a second on the extreme precariousness of a servant's life. If Wilson had not gone with Miss Barrett, she would have been, as Miss Barrett knew, "turned into the street before sunset," with only a few shillings, presumably, saved from her sixteen pounds a year. And what then would have been her fate? Since English fiction in the 'forties scarcely deals with the lives of ladies' maids, and biography had not then cast its searchlight so low, the question must remain a question. But Wilson took the plunge. She declared that she would "go anywhere in the world with me." She left the basement, the room, the whole of that world of Wimpole Street, which to Wilson meant all civilisation, all right thinking and decent living, for the wild debauchery and irreligion of a foreign land. Nothing is more curious than to observe the conflict that took place in Italy between Wilson's English gentility and her natural passions. She derided the Italian Court; she was shocked by Italian pictures. But, though "she was struck back by the indecency of the Venus," Wilson, greatly to her credit, seems to have bethought her that women are naked when they take their clothes off. Even I myself, she may have thought, am naked for two or three seconds daily. And so "She thinks she shall try again, and the troublesome modesty may subside, who knows?" That it did subside rapidly is plain. Soon she not merely approved of Italy; she had fallen in love with Signor Righi of the Grand Ducal bodyguard—"all highly respectable and moral men, and some six feet high"—was wearing an engagement ring; was dismissing a London suitor; and was learning to speak Italian. Then the clouds descend again; when they lift they show us Wilson deserted—"the faithless Righi had backed out of his engagement to Wilson." Suspicion attaches to his brother, a wholesale haberdasher at Prato. When Righi resigned from the Ducal bodyguard, he became, on his brother's advice, a retail haberdasher at Prato. Whether his position required a knowledge of haberdashery in his wife, whether one of the girls of Prato could supply it, it is certain that he did not write to Wilson as often as he should have done. But what conduct it was on the part of this highly respectable and moral man that led Mrs. Browning to exclaim in 1850, "[Wilson] is over it completely, which does the greatest credit to her good sense and rectitude of character. How could she continue to love such a man?"—why Righi had shrunk to "such a man" in so short a time, it is impossible to say. Deserted by Righi, Wilson became more and more attached to the Browning family. She discharged not only the duties of a lady's maid, but cooked knead cakes, made dresses, and became a devoted nurse to Penini, the baby; so that in time the baby himself exalted her to the rank of the family, where she justly belonged, and refused to call her anything but Lily. In 1855 Wilson married Romagnoli, the Brownings' manservant, "a good tender-hearted man"; and for some time the two kept house for the Brownings. But in 1859 Robert Browning "accepted office as Landor's guardian," an office of great delicacy and responsibility, for Landor's habits were difficult; "of restraint he has not a grain," Mrs. Browning wrote, "and of suspiciousness many grains." In these circumstances Wilson was appointed "his duenna" with a salary of twenty-two pounds a year "besides what is left of his rations." Later her wages were increased to thirty pounds, for to act as duenna to "an old lion" who has "the impulses of a tiger," throws his plate out of the window or dashes it on the ground if he dislikes his dinner, and suspects servants of opening desks, entailed, as Mrs. Browning observed, "certain risks, and I for one would rather not meet them." But to Wilson, who had known Mr. Barrett and the spirits, a few plates more or less flying out of the window or dashed upon the floor was a matter of little consequence—such risks were all in the day's work.

[7]That day, so far as it is still visible to us, was certainly a strange one. Whether it began or not in some remote English village, it ended in Venice in the Palazzo Rezzonico. There at least she was still living in the year 1897, a widow, in the house of the little boy whom she had nursed and loved—Mr. Barrett Browning. A very strange day it had been, she may have thought, as she sat in the red Venetian sunset, an old woman, dreaming. Her friends, married to farm hands, still stumbled up the English lanes to fetch a pint of beer. And she had eloped with Miss Barrett to Italy; she had seen all kinds of queer things—revolutions, guardsmen, spirits; Mr. Landor throwing his plate out of the window. Then Mrs. Browning had died—there can have been no lack of thoughts in Wilson's old head as she sat at the window of the Palazzo Rezzonico in the evening. But nothing can be more vain than to pretend that we can guess what they were, for she was typical of the great army of her kind—the inscrutable, the all- but-silent, the all-but-invisible servant maids of history. "A more honest, true and affectionate heart than Wilson's cannot be found"— her mistress's words may serve her for epitaph.

[8]"he was scourged by fleas." It appears that Italy was famous for its fleas in the middle of the nineteenth century. Indeed, they served to break down conventions that were otherwise insurmountable. For example, when Nathaniel Hawthorne went to tea with Miss Bremer in Rome (1858), "we spoke of fleas—insects that, in Rome, come home to everybody's business and bosom, and are so common and inevitable, that no delicacy is felt about alluding to the sufferings they inflict. Poor little Miss Bremer was tormented with one while turning out our tea...."

[9]"Nero had leapt from a top window." Nero (c. 1849-60) was, according to Carlyle, "A little Cuban (Maltese? and otherwise mongrel) shock, mostly white—a most affectionate, lively little dog, otherwise of small merit, and little or no training." Material for a life of him abounds, but this is not the occasion to make use of it. It is enough to say that he was stolen; that he brought Carlyle a cheque to buy a horse with tied round his neck; that "twice or thrice I flung him into the sea [at Aberdour], which he didn't at all like"; that in 1850 he sprang from the library window, and, clearing the area spikes, fell "plash" on to the pavement. "It was after breakfast," Mrs. Carlyle says, "and he had been standing at the open window, watching the birds... . Lying in my bed, I heard thro' the deal partition Elizabeth scream: Oh God! oh Nero! and rush downstairs like a strong wind out at the street door ... then I sprang to meet her in my night- shift. ... Mr. C. came down from his bedroom with his chin all over soap and asked, 'Has anything happened to Nero?'—'Oh, sir, he must have broken all his legs, he leapt out at your window!'— 'God bless me!' said Mr. C. and returned to finish his shaving." No bones were broken, however, and he survived, to be run over by a butcher's cart, and to die at last from the effects of the accident on 1st February, 1860. He is buried at the top of the garden at Cheyne Row under a small stone tablet.

[10]Whether he wished to kill himself, or whether, as Mrs. Carlyle insinuates, he was merely jumping after birds, might be the occasion for an extremely interesting treatise on canine psychology. Some hold that Byron's dog went mad in sympathy with Byron; others that Nero was driven to desperate melancholy by associating with Mr. Carlyle. The whole question of dogs' relation to the spirit of the age, whether it is possible to call one dog Elizabethan, another Augustan, another Victorian, together with the influence upon dogs of the poetry and philosophy of their masters, deserves a fuller discussion than can here be given it. For the present, Nero's motives must remain obscure.

[11] "Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton thought himself invisible." Mrs. Huth Jackson in A Victorian Childhood says, "Lord Arthur Russell told me, many years later, that when a small boy he was taken to Knebworth by his mother. Next morning he was in the big hall having breakfast when a strange-looking old gentleman in a shabby dressing-gown came in and walked slowly round the table staring at each of the guests in turn. He heard his mother's neighbour whisper to her, 'Do not take any notice, he thinks he is invisible'. It was Lord Lytton himself" (pp. 17-18).

[12]"he was now dead". It is certain that Flush died; but the date and manner of his death are unknown. The only reference consists in the statement that "Flush lived to a good old age and is buried in the vaults of Casa Guidi". Mrs. Browning was buried in the English Cemetery at Florence, Robert Browning in Westminster Abbey. Flush still lies, therefore, beneath the house in which, once upon a time, the Brownings lived.
