前言


从古至今，传说、传奇、神话和童话陪伴人们度过童年，因为每个健康的孩子都喜爱神奇、不可思议、明显不真实的故事，这份喜爱天生而有益。格林和安徒生童话中长着翅膀的仙子，在人类创造出的所有东西中，最让孩子心里快乐。

以前的童话滋养了世世代代的人，现在也许可以归入少儿图书中“历史”这个类别；现在是一系列新“童话”的时代，这些童话去除了脸谱化的妖怪、矮人、仙子，也去除了所有恐怖和令人毛骨悚然的情节，过去的作者用这些情节赋予每个故事令人畏惧的道德寓意。现代教育包含道德教导，所以现代儿童从童话中只寻找乐趣，乐意不看所有不愉快的情节。

我带着这种想法写了《奥兹国历险记》，只为让今日的孩子开心。希望它成为一部现代化的童话，里面奇妙和欢乐常在，没有心痛和噩梦。

第一章　旋风


多萝西住在堪萨斯大草原中部，她同农夫亨利叔叔和他的妻子艾姆婶婶一起生活。他们的房子很小，因为建房子用的木料要用马车从好多英里外运来。这栋房子只有四面墙、地板和天花板围成的一间屋子；屋里有一只锈迹斑斑的煮饭炉、一个碗柜、一张桌子、三四把椅子，还有两张床。亨利叔叔和艾姆婶婶的大床摆在房间的一角，多萝西的小床摆在另一角。房子没有阁楼，也没有地下室，只在地板上挖了一个小洞，叫“旋风地窖”。万一刮起旋风，一家人可以躲进去。大风威力强劲，所过之处，无不墙倒屋塌。地板中央有一扇活板门，沿着梯子走下去，就到了又小又黑的地窖。

多萝西站在门口，朝四周望去，只见灰蒙蒙的大草原。这片广阔、平坦的原野四面延伸到天际，连一棵树、一座房子也没有。太阳炙烤着耕种过的土地，将它变成一大片灰色，布满小裂缝。就连草也不绿，因为长长的叶子梢儿被太阳晒焦，成了和四周一样的灰色。房子粉刷过一次，但是涂料被太阳晒得冒泡，又被雨水冲刷，现在这栋房子就像其他东西一样单调灰暗。

艾姆婶婶刚来这里住的时候，是一个年轻漂亮的妻子。日晒和风吹也改变了她。她眼睛里的神采消失了，只留下淡然的灰色；脸颊和嘴唇不再红润，也变成了灰色。她又瘦又憔悴，现在从来都不笑。多萝西是个孤儿，她刚到这里时，艾姆婶婶被这个孩子的笑声吓了一跳，只要多萝西欢快的笑声传进她的耳朵，她就捂紧胸口尖叫；她惊奇地看着这个小姑娘，不明白有什么好笑的。

亨利叔叔从来也不笑。他从早到晚辛勤劳动，不知道什么是快乐。他从长胡子到粗陋的靴子，浑身也灰蒙蒙的，表情严厉，很少说话。

是托托逗多萝西笑，不让她变得像周围其他东西一样灰蒙蒙。托托不是灰色的；它是一只黑色的小狗，缎子一样的长毛，黑色的小眼睛长在滑稽的小鼻子两边，欢快地闪闪发亮。托托整天玩耍，多萝西陪它玩，她非常喜爱托托。

但今天，他们没有玩。亨利叔叔坐在门前的台阶上，担忧地望向天空，天色比平时更灰暗。多萝西站在门前，怀里抱着托托，也望着天空。艾姆婶婶在洗盘子。

北方远远传来低沉的风吼，亨利叔叔和多萝西可以看见高草在风暴来临之前像波涛般翻滚。这时，南方的空中也传来尖利的呼啸声，他们朝那边转过头，看见从那个方向草的波涛也正一浪一浪地逼近。

亨利叔叔突然站起来。

“旋风要来了，艾姆。”他冲妻子喊道，“我去看看牲口。”说完，他就朝关牛马的牲口棚跑去。

艾姆婶婶放下手中的活儿，来到门边。只看了一眼，她就知道危险近在眼前。

“快，多萝西！”她尖叫道，“跑到地窖去！”

托托从多萝西的怀里跳出来，藏到床下，小姑娘去抓它。艾姆婶婶吓坏了，一把拉开地板上的活板门，沿着梯子爬进又小又黑的地窖。多萝西终于抓住了托托，要跟上婶婶。她已经走到屋子的中央，突然传来一阵猛烈的风啸声，房子剧烈地摇晃起来，多萝西脚下不稳，一屁股跌坐在地板上。

这时，一件奇怪的事发生了。

房子转动了两三下，缓缓升空。多萝西感觉自己像是坐在气球里往上升。

北风和南风在房子所在的地方会合，房子正好位于旋风中心。旋风中央的空气一般是静止的，但房子四周巨大的风压使它缓缓升高，直升到旋风的顶端，然后它就停在那里，随风飘移了好多英里。旋风带动房子，就像你拿起羽毛一样容易。

天色很暗，狂风在周围嘶吼，但多萝西发现她飞得挺轻松。房子起初旋转了几圈，有一次又倾斜得厉害，这之后她就觉得自己好像摇篮中的婴儿，被轻柔地摇晃着。

托托不喜欢这样。它大声吠叫着乱跑，一会儿跑到这里，一会儿跑到那里。而多萝西却静静地坐在地板上，等着看会发生什么。

有一次，托托离打开的活板门太近，掉了下去；小姑娘一开始以为自己永远失去了托托。可是不一会儿，她看见托托的一只耳朵竖在洞口，原来强大的气压托住了它，它掉不下去。她爬到洞口，抓住托托的耳朵，把它拉回屋里，然后关上活板门，这样就不会再发生意外了。

一小时又一小时过去了，多萝西渐渐战胜恐惧，但她觉得很孤独，四周狂风嘶吼，她几乎什么也听不见。一开始，她担心房子落地时自己会摔得粉碎，但几个小时过去了，什么可怕的事也没发生，她就不再担心，打算静静等待，看将来会怎样。最后，她爬过摇动的地板到自己的床边，躺了下来；托托跟着她，躺在她身边。

尽管房子在摇晃，风在呼啸，但多萝西很快闭上眼睛，睡熟了。





第二章　遇见芒奇金人


她被震醒了，这震动突然而剧烈，要不是多萝西躺在柔软的床上，就被震伤了。实际上，这震动使她屏住呼吸，想弄明白发生了什么事。托托冰凉的小鼻子贴着她的脸，惊恐地哀叫。多萝西坐起来，注意到房子不动了；天也不黑了，明亮的阳光照进窗口，小屋里亮堂堂。多萝西跳下床，跑去开门，托托紧跟在她身后。

小姑娘惊叫一声，她环顾四周，看到眼前奇妙的景象，眼睛睁得越发大了。

旋风轻轻地——对旋风来说很轻——把房子安放在一片异常美丽的国度中央。这里到处草儿青青，高大的树木上结满甜美的果子。坡上到处鲜花绚烂，树林间、灌木丛中鸟儿一身珍奇、鲜艳的羽毛，扑棱着翅膀在歌唱。不远处是一条闪亮的小溪，在翠绿的河岸间奔流。小溪那潺潺的低语，对一个长期在干旱的、灰蒙蒙的大草原上生活的小姑娘来说，真是动听极了。

多萝西站在那里，热切地望着奇异、美丽的景色，这时，她注意到有一小群怪模怪样的人朝她走来，她从没见过长这么怪的人。他们没有她平常见到的大人那样高，可也不是特别矮小。其实，他们跟多萝西差不多高，在她这个年纪，她算个子高的，但这群人看上去比多萝西年纪大很多。

这三男一女，都打扮古怪。他们戴着圆帽，尖尖的帽顶有一英尺高，帽檐缀着小铃铛，他们一走动，这些小铃铛就发出清脆的叮当声。男人戴蓝帽，女人戴白帽。那女人身穿白袍，衣褶从两肩垂落，上面点缀着小星星，在太阳底下像钻石一样闪闪发亮。男人们穿蓝衣，和帽子的色调一样，脚蹬锃亮的靴子，靴筒顶端有厚厚的卷边。多萝西心想，这三个男人和亨利叔叔岁数差不多，因为其中两个长着大胡子。不过那个矮个子女人肯定年纪更大。她满脸皱纹，头发差不多全白了，走路姿势非常僵硬。

多萝西站在门口，这几个人朝房子走来，不一会儿，他们停下了脚步，交头接耳一番，像是不敢继续往前走。最后，那矮个老太太走到多萝西面前，深鞠一躬，用甜美的声音说道：

“欢迎你，最高贵的魔法师，欢迎来到芒奇金国。我们非常感激你杀死了邪恶的东方女巫，使我们的人民获得自由。”

听到这番话，多萝西很吃惊。矮个老太太管她叫魔法师，还说她杀死了邪恶的东方女巫，这是什么意思？多萝西是个天真的小姑娘，没伤害过什么，她被旋风带到离家很多英里的地方；她可从来没有杀死过任何东西。

但矮个老太太显然等着她回答；于是，多萝西犹豫地说：

“你真好，可是你肯定搞错了。我什么也没杀死啊。”

“不管怎么说，是你的房子杀死了她，”矮个老太太笑道，“这是一回事。看！”她指着房子一角，又说道，“她的两只脚还伸在木块下。”

多萝西往那边看去，吓得轻轻叫了一声。是的，就在架起房子的大梁一角下面，伸出两只脚，脚上穿着尖头银鞋。

“噢，天哪！噢，天哪！”多萝西喊道，惊愕地紧握双手，“房子肯定掉到了她身上。我们该怎么办啊？”

“不怎么办啊。”矮个老太太平静地说。

“可她是谁？”多萝西问。

“她是邪恶的东方女巫，我刚才说了。”矮个老太太回答，“她奴役所有芒奇金人好多年了，让他们日日夜夜伺候她。现在他们都自由了，很感激你帮忙。”

“芒奇金人是谁？”多萝西问。

“他们是在这片东方土地上生活的人，而这片土地由邪恶的女巫统治着。”

“你是芒奇金人吗？”多萝西问。

“不是，但我是他们的朋友，我生活在北方土地上。芒奇金人看见东方女巫死了，就赶紧捎信给我，我马上就来了。我是北方女巫。”

“噢，天哪！”多萝西叫道，“你真的是女巫？”

“真的。”矮个老太太答道，“但我是好女巫，人们都喜欢我。邪恶女巫统治着这地方，她法力比我强大，不然我自个儿早就让这些人自由了。”

“可我还以为所有的女巫都是邪恶的。”小姑娘面对真正的女巫，有些害怕。

“噢，不，这真是个大误会。整个奥兹国只有四个女巫，其中两个，就是住在北方和南方的女巫，是好的。我知道真是这样的，因为我自己就是其中一个，错不了。住在东方和西方的那两个女巫确实很邪恶；但现在你杀死了她俩中的一个，那么整个奥兹国就只剩下一个邪恶女巫，就是住在西方的女巫。”

“可是，”多萝西想了一会儿，说，“艾姆婶婶告诉过我，女巫全都死了，好多好多年以前就死了。”

“艾姆婶婶是谁？”矮个老太太问。

“她是我婶婶，住在堪萨斯州，我就是从那里来的。”

北方女巫低头看着地面，好像在思考。过了一会儿，她抬起头，说：

“我不知道堪萨斯州在哪里，我从来没听谁提过这个国家。你告诉我，这是个文明国家吗？”

“是的。”多萝西回答。

“这就对了。我想，文明国家现在已经没有女巫、男巫，也没有女魔法师或男魔法师了。但是，你看，奥兹国从来没有过文明，因为我们与世界的其他地方隔绝了。所以，我们中间还有女巫和男巫。”

“谁是男巫？”多萝西问。

“奥兹本人就是大巫师。”女巫压低嗓子回答，“他的魔力比我们几个加在一块儿还要强。他住在翡翠城。”

多萝西正想再问一个问题，突然，一直站在旁边没出声的芒奇金人大叫起来，他们指着邪恶女巫躺着的屋角。

“怎么了？”矮个老太太问，她朝那边看了一眼，就笑了。死去的女巫的两只脚完全不见了，只剩下一双银鞋。

“她年纪太大了，”北方女巫解释道，“被太阳晒干了。这就是她的下场。这双银鞋归你了，你应该穿上。”她说着弯身捡起鞋子，抖抖上面的灰土，递给多萝西。

“东方女巫很为这双银鞋得意，”一个芒奇金人说，“它们带有一些魔力，但我们从来不知道究竟是什么魔力。”

多萝西把鞋拿进屋，放到桌上。之后，她又走出来，对芒奇金人说：

“我要赶紧回到我叔叔婶婶那里，他们肯定会担心我的。你们能帮我找到回去的路吗？”

芒奇金人和女巫先是看看彼此，然后又看看多萝西，最后摇摇头。

“往东去，离这里不远，”一个芒奇金人说，“是一片大沙漠，没有人能够活着走出去。”

“南方也一样，”另一个说，“我去过那里，亲眼见过。南边是夸德令人的国家。”

“我听说，”又一个说，“西方也是这样。那个国家生活着温基人，由邪恶的西方女巫统治。她会把过路人抓去做奴隶。”

“北方是我的家，”老太太说，“那四周和这奥兹国周围的是同一个大沙漠。亲爱的，恐怕你得和我们一起生活了。”

听到这话，多萝西抽抽搭搭地哭了，因为在这些陌生人中，她感到孤独。她的眼泪好像使好心的芒奇金人伤心起来，因为他们立刻掏出手绢，也哭了。这时，那个矮个老太太摘下帽子，把帽尖顶在鼻尖上，她声音庄重地数着“一，二，三”。帽子立时变成一块石板，上面用白色粉笔写着几个大字：

“让多萝西去翡翠城”。

矮个老太太从鼻子上取下石板，读出上面的话，她问：

“亲爱的，你叫多萝西吗？”

“是的。”小姑娘抬起头，擦擦眼泪。

“那你必须去翡翠城。也许奥兹会帮助你。”

“这座城在哪里？”多萝西问。

“就在这个国家的正中央，由奥兹统治，他就是我跟你说的大巫师。”

“他是好人吗？”多萝西担心地问。

“他是个好巫师。他是不是人，我就不知道了，因为我从来没见过他。”

“我怎么去那儿呢？”多萝西问。

“你得走路去。路途遥远，你要经过的土地有时舒适宜人，有时又黑暗可怕。不过，我会使出我知道的全部魔法，保护你不受伤害。”

“你不和我一起去吗？”小姑娘恳求道，她已经开始把矮个老太太当成她唯一的朋友了。

“不行，我不能去，”她回答，“但我会给你一个吻，没有人敢伤害一个被北方女巫吻过的人。”

她走近多萝西，在她额头上轻轻一吻。不久之后，多萝西发现北方女巫嘴唇触碰过的地方，留下了一个闪亮的圆形记号。

“通往翡翠城的路铺着黄砖，”女巫说，“所以你不会迷路。你见到奥兹，不要害怕，把你的故事讲给他听，请他帮助你。再见了，亲爱的。”

三个芒奇金人向她深鞠一躬，祝她旅途愉快。说完，他们穿过树林，离开了。女巫朝多萝西友好地点点头，随后左脚跟着地转了三圈，立即消失了。这让小托托吃惊极了，女巫一消失，它就在她身后大声吠叫，因为女巫在的时候，它吓得都不敢叫。

但多萝西知道她是女巫，料到她会那样消失，所以一点也不吃惊。





第三章　多萝西救稻草人


只剩下多萝西自己了，她开始觉得饿了。于是，她走到橱柜边，切了几片面包，抹上黄油。她分给托托一些，然后从架子上取下水桶，提到小溪那里，打了满满一桶澄澈、闪亮的溪水。托托跑到树下，冲着树上的鸟儿吠叫。多萝西过去逮托托，抬头看见枝头挂着鲜美的果子，于是她就摘下几颗，发现正好当早餐。

接着，她回到屋里，和托托一起痛快地喝饱清凉、澄澈的溪水，她准备要踏上去往翡翠城的旅途了。

多萝西只有一件换洗衣服，恰好干干净净地挂在小床旁的挂钩上。这是一条蓝白格子的棉布连衣裙，因为洗过很多次，蓝色褪色了，但还是很漂亮。小姑娘仔细梳洗一番，穿上干净的格子裙，系好粉色的太阳帽。她拿了一只小篮子，装满从橱柜里拿出的面包，再盖上一块白布。接着，她一低头，看到脚上的鞋破旧不堪。

“这双鞋肯定不能走远路，托托。”她说。托托仰着头，小黑眼睛望着多萝西的脸，它摇摇尾巴，表示明白她的意思。

这时，多萝西看到了桌上的银鞋，这双鞋从前是东方女巫的。

“不知道我穿合不合脚？”她对托托说，“穿这双鞋走远路正合适，穿不坏。”

她脱下自己的旧皮鞋，试穿上银鞋，这双鞋就像专为她定做的一样合脚。

最后，她挽起篮子。

“走啦，托托。”她说，“我们去翡翠城，问问大巫师奥兹怎么回堪萨斯去。”

多萝西关上门，上好锁，又小心地把钥匙放进裙子口袋。就这样，她起身上路，托托一副认真模样，快步小跑跟着她。

附近有好几条路，但多萝西没费多少工夫就找到了铺着黄砖的那条。不一会儿，她就步伐轻快地朝翡翠城赶去，银鞋踏着坚硬的黄砖路面，发出悦耳的叮叮声。阳光灿烂，鸟儿歌声美妙，多萝西几乎没有像大家可能认为的那样，因为突然被大风刮到远离家乡的陌生地方而感到沮丧。

她走在路上，惊奇地发现周围的景色十分美。路旁是整齐的篱笆，刷成清爽的蓝色，篱笆那边是成片的田地，种着许多庄稼和蔬菜。显然，芒奇金人都是种田的好把式，能取得很好的收成。多萝西不时路过一所房子，房子里的人都出来看她，深深地鞠躬送她离去；人人都知道是多萝西杀死了邪恶女巫，使他们重获自由。芒奇金人的房子外观古怪，每一所都是圆形的，都有一个大圆屋顶。所有房子都刷成蓝色，因为这个东方国家的人最喜欢蓝色。

傍晚，多萝西经过一天的长途跋涉，十分乏累，她开始考虑该去哪里过夜。这时，她走到一所房子门口，这所房子比别的房子都大。门前的绿草地上，有不少男男女女在跳舞。五个小提琴手卖力地拉琴，人们欢笑歌唱。旁边的大桌子上摆满了美味的水果、坚果、馅饼、蛋糕，还有许多别的美食。

人们和善地跟多萝西打招呼，邀请她共进晚餐并在他们这里过夜。这所房子的主人是这地方最富有的一个芒奇金人，他和朋友们在这里欢聚，庆祝脱离邪恶女巫的奴役，重获自由。

多萝西吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐。那个富有的芒奇金人叫波克，他亲自招待多萝西。饭后，多萝西坐在长椅上，看人们跳舞。

波克看见她穿着银鞋，就说：

“你一定是个大魔法师。”

“为什么？”小姑娘问。

“因为你穿着银鞋，还杀死了邪恶女巫。还有，你的连衣裙上有白色格子，只有女巫和魔法师才穿白色衣服。”

“我的裙子是蓝白两色的。”多萝西说着，拉平裙子上的褶皱。

“你这么穿非常好。”波克说，“蓝色是芒奇金人的颜色，白色是女巫的颜色。这样，我们就知道你是个友好的女巫。”

多萝西不知道应该怎么回答，因为所有的人好像都以为她是个女巫，可她十分清楚自己只是个普普通通的小姑娘，很偶然地被旋风带到这个陌生的地方。

多萝西看人们跳舞看累了，波克就领她进了房子，来到一个摆着漂亮小床的房间。床上铺着蓝布床单，多萝西美美地睡到天亮。托托蜷着身子睡在她旁边的蓝色毯子上。

多萝西边吃丰盛的早餐，边看着一个小不点儿的芒奇金宝宝和托托玩，小宝宝拽托托的尾巴，又叫又笑，这把多萝西逗乐了。托托勾起了所有人的好奇心，因为这之前他们谁也没见过狗。

“这里离翡翠城多远啊？”小姑娘问。

“不知道，”波克严肃地回答，“我从来没去过那里。要是没有什么事非要和奥兹打交道，还是离他远一点好。但我知道翡翠城还很远，要走好几天。这里富饶舒适，可你要走过崎岖危险的地方，才能到达旅途的终点。”

这番话让多萝西有些担心，不过，她知道只有大巫师奥兹才能帮她回到堪萨斯州，于是她做出勇敢的决定，就是不回头。

她告别了朋友，又沿着黄砖路出发了。走了几英里后，她觉得该停下歇歇脚，于是爬上路边的篱笆，坐下来。篱笆那边有一大片玉米地。多萝西看见不远处有个稻草人，高高地绑在一根竿子上，让鸟雀不能靠近成熟的玉米。

多萝西手托下巴，望着稻草人出神。他的脑袋是一只装满稻草的小麻袋，画着眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴，代表一张脸。一顶破旧的蓝色尖顶帽，从前是哪个芒奇金人的，现在戴在他头上。他身上穿着一套蓝色衣服，已经破旧褪色，里面也塞满稻草。脚上是一双蓝色筒旧靴子，与这国度里所有人一样。他背后绑着竿子，竖在玉米地里，比玉米秆还高。

多萝西仔细盯着稻草人那张画上去的、奇怪的脸，惊奇地发现他的一只眼睛竟然在朝自己慢慢眨动。一开始，她以为自己看错了，因为堪萨斯没有一个稻草人眨眼睛；可是现在这个稻草人冲她友好地点头呢。于是，多萝西爬下篱笆，走近稻草人，这时托托绕着竿子，边跑边叫。

“你好。”稻草人哑着嗓子说。

“你会说话？”小姑娘很惊讶。

“当然。”稻草人回答，“你好吗？”

“我很好，谢谢。”多萝西礼貌地回答，“你呢？”

“我感觉不好。”稻草人微笑着说，“因为整日整夜被挂在这里吓唬乌鸦，真没趣。”

“你不能下来吗？”多萝西问。

“不能。我后背绑在这根竿子上。如果你能把竿子拿走，我会很感激你的。”

多萝西伸出双臂，把稻草人从竿子上取下来，因为他身子里面塞的是稻草，所以很轻。

“谢谢你。”等稻草人被放到地上，他说，“我觉得自己是个新人了。”

多萝西听到这话，有些糊涂。听一个里面塞着稻草的人说话，看他鞠躬还跟自己并肩走路，这真稀奇。

“你是谁？”稻草人舒展身子，打了个哈欠，问道，“要去哪儿？”

“我叫多萝西。”小姑娘说，“我要去翡翠城，请伟大的奥兹送我回堪萨斯。”

“翡翠城在哪儿？”稻草人问，“奥兹是谁？”

“啊，你不知道吗？”多萝西吃惊地反问道。

“是的，我真不知道。我什么也不知道。你看，我是稻草填充起来的，所以我根本没有脑子。”他伤心地回答。

“噢，”多萝西说，“我很难过。”

“你觉得，”稻草人问，“如果我和你一起去翡翠城，奥兹会给我些脑子吗？”

“我说不准，”多萝西回答，“不过如果你愿意的话，可以和我一起去。就算奥兹一点脑子也不给你，你的情况也不会比现在更糟。”

“那倒没错。”稻草人说，“你知道，”他诚恳地接着说，“我不介意自己的腿、胳膊和身子是填充的，因为这样我不会受伤。要是有人踩我的脚趾或者用针扎我，也不要紧，因为我感觉不到。但我不想被人叫笨蛋，可是如果我的脑袋一直填满稻草，而不是像你一样装满脑子的话，我怎么能知道哪怕一点事情呢？”

“我理解你的感受。”小姑娘说，她真的为稻草人难过，“如果你跟我一起走，我会请求奥兹尽力帮助你。”

“谢谢。”稻草人感激地说。

他们回到路上。多萝西扶稻草人翻过篱笆，之后他们就沿着黄砖路继续往翡翠城去。

一开始，托托不喜欢稻草人加入。它绕着稻草人一个劲地嗅，仿佛怀疑稻草里面藏着一窝老鼠，还不时凶巴巴地朝稻草人大叫。

“别在意托托。”多萝西对她的新朋友说，“它从不咬人。”

“噢，我不害怕。”稻草人回答，“它伤害不了稻草。请让我为你提篮子，我不会在乎，因为我不会觉得累。我要告诉你一个秘密，”他一边走一边说，“在这世界上，我只怕一件东西。”

“是什么？”多萝西问，“是那个做出你的芒奇金农夫吗？”

“不是，”稻草人说，“我害怕划燃的火柴。”





第四章　穿过森林的路


走了几个小时，路开始变得崎岖，越来越难走，稻草人经常被高低不平的黄砖绊倒。有的地方，黄砖甚至破碎或者干脆不见了，地面坑坑洼洼，这时，托托就跳过去，多萝西就绕着走。可是稻草人没有脑子，只会笔直地往前走，于是他一脚踩进坑里，直挺挺地摔倒在坚硬的砖头上。不过，他从来不会受伤。多萝西看见后，就把他提起来，帮他重新站好。对刚才的倒霉事，他和多萝西一起开心地大笑。

这里的农场不像已被他们远远留在身后的那些地方，没有得到那么精心的照料。房子和果树也都少了，他们越往前走，沿路的景象越荒凉、冷清。

中午，他们在靠近一条小溪的路边坐下。多萝西打开篮子，拿出几片面包。她递给稻草人一片，但稻草人没要。

“我从来不饿，”他说，“这是一件幸运的事。我的嘴只是画上去的，要是割开一道口子，我也能吃饭。但那样的话，填充我的稻草就会钻出来，会破坏我脑袋的形状。”

多萝西立刻就看出确实是这样，于是她只是点点头，继续吃面包。

“跟我讲讲你自己的事，还有你来自的那个国家。”稻草人等多萝西吃完，说道。多萝西就把堪萨斯所有的事都跟稻草人说了，告诉他那里一切都是灰蒙蒙的，还告诉他旋风怎样把她带到了这个奇异的奥兹国。

稻草人认真地听完，然后说：

“我不明白你为什么想离开这个美丽的国家，而回到那个你叫作堪萨斯的干旱的、灰蒙蒙的地方。”

“因为你没有脑子。”小姑娘说，“不管我们的家乡有多么干燥、多么灰蒙蒙，我们这些有血有肉的人都宁愿住在那里，而不愿住在别的国家，就算它再美也不行。哪里也比不上家乡。”

稻草人叹了口气。

“我当然明白不了，”他说，“要是你们的脑袋里塞的是稻草，就像我一样，也许你们就会都住在美丽的地方，而堪萨斯就会根本没人住。你们有脑子，这是堪萨斯的幸运。”

“我们休息时，你给我们讲个故事好吗？”小姑娘请求道。

听到这话，稻草人用责备的眼神望着多萝西，回答道：

“我的生命太短暂，所以我什么事也不知道。我是前天才被农夫做好的。那之前世界上发生的事，我一点都不知道。幸运的是，农夫扎好我的脑袋以后，首先就给我画上耳朵，于是我听到了那会儿正在发生的事。他身边还有一个芒奇金人，我听到的第一件事是，那个农夫问：

“‘你觉得这两只耳朵怎么样？’

“‘它们不直。’另一个芒奇金人回答。

“‘没关系，’那个农夫说，‘反正它们还是耳朵。’这话倒是很对。

“‘现在，我要做眼睛了。’那个农夫说着，给我画了右眼。他一画好，我就发现自己怀着强烈的好奇心看着他，看着我周围的一切，因为这是我第一次看到世界。

“‘这只眼睛很漂亮。’那个芒奇金人看着农夫，评论道，‘蓝漆做眼睛的颜色正好。’

“‘我想把另一只眼睛画得更大一点。’农夫说。第二只眼睛画好后，我看得比之前更清楚了。随后，他又给我画了鼻子和嘴。但我没有说话，因为那时候我还不知道嘴是用来做什么的。我看着他们给我做身子、胳膊和腿，觉得很有趣。最后，他们固定好我的脑袋，那一刻，我非常自豪，以为自己也和别人一样。

“‘这家伙会很快吓走乌鸦的，’农夫说，‘他看着真像个人。’

“‘对啊，他就是人。’另一个说。我很赞同他的说法。那个农夫把我夹在胳膊下，走进玉米地，将我挂在一根高高的竿子上，你们就是在那儿看到我的。之后，他和他的朋友很快就离开了，留下我一个人。

“我不想这样被他们丢下，所以就想跟他们走。但我的脚着不了地，我只好待在竿子上。我过得孤独，因为没有什么事可想，毕竟我才被做好不久。许多乌鸦和小鸟飞进玉米地，但一看见我，它们就又飞走，以为我是个芒奇金人；这让我很开心，让我觉得自己是个重要人物。后来，一只老乌鸦一点点飞近我，他对着我仔细端详一番后，落在我肩膀上，说道：

“‘我怀疑那农夫想用这个蠢办法愚弄我。任何有脑子的乌鸦都看得出来，你不过是稻草填充的。’说着，他跳到我脚边，尽情地吃玉米。其他鸟看见我伤害不了那老乌鸦，也来吃玉米，这样不一会儿，我身边就围了一大群鸟。

“为此，我很伤心，因为这说明我根本不是一个称职的稻草人。但老乌鸦安慰我说：‘如果你脑袋里有脑子的话，就会像他们任何人一样棒，甚至比其中一些人还要棒。脑子是这个世界上唯一值得拥有的东西，不管你是乌鸦还是人。’

“乌鸦们走后，我琢磨这件事，决定尽力弄些脑子来。这是运气好，你们路过，把我从竿子上放下来，照你们说，我们一到翡翠城，伟大的奥兹肯定就会给我一些脑子。”

“我希望是这样，”多萝西真诚地说，“既然你好像急着要得到脑子。”

“噢，是的；我很着急。”稻草人回答，“知道自己是个傻瓜，这感觉真不好。”

“那好，”小姑娘说，“我们走吧。”她把篮子递给稻草人。

这段路边上一根篱笆也没有，路两旁是坑坑洼洼、没有开垦的荒地。傍晚，他们来到一大片森林边上，这里树木高大，一棵挨着一棵，茂密的树枝在黄砖路上方交叠，遮住了阳光，树下几乎一片黑暗。但是几个旅行者没有停步，继续走进了森林。

“如果这条路能进森林，那肯定也能出去，”稻草人说，“翡翠城在路的另一头，所以我们必须沿着这条路走，不管它通向哪里。”

“这个谁都知道。”多萝西说。

“当然；所以我才知道啊。”稻草人回答，“如果需要脑子才能弄明白，我无论如何也说不出来。”

约莫一个小时后，光线渐渐暗淡，他们在黑漆漆的森林里一路磕磕绊绊。多萝西什么也看不见，但托托能看见，因为有的狗在暗处也看得清清楚楚；而稻草人说他看得像白天一样清楚。于是，多萝西挽着稻草人的胳膊，安安稳稳地往前走。

“如果你看见什么房子，或者什么我们可以过夜的地方，”她说，“你一定要告诉我；因为摸黑赶路太不舒服了。”

没多久，稻草人站住脚。

“我看见我们右边有个小屋，”他说，“是用圆木和树枝建成的。我们过去吗？”

“当然过去。”小姑娘说，“我累坏了。”

于是，稻草人领着多萝西穿过森林，走到小木屋门口。多萝西走进小屋，发现屋角有一张干树叶铺成的床。她立刻躺下，不一会儿就沉沉入睡，托托就卧在她身边。稻草人永远也不知疲倦，他站在另一个角落，耐心地等待清晨到来。





第五章　解救铁皮樵夫


多萝西醒来时，太阳照进森林，托托早已出去追逐周围的小鸟和松鼠。她坐起身，四下张望。稻草人还耐心地站在那个角落，等着她。

“我们得去找水。”她对稻草人说。

“你为什么要水？”稻草人问。

“洗净脸上赶路的灰尘，喝点水，不让干面包卡在嗓子里。”

“血肉之躯肯定有不便之处，”稻草人若有所思，“你必须睡觉，还要吃饭喝水。可是，你有脑子，能真正思考，这些麻烦算不了什么。”

他们离开小木屋，在森林里走，直到看见一股清澈的泉水。多萝西喝了水，洗了脸，吃过早餐。她看到篮子里剩的面包不多了，幸好稻草人不用吃东西，因为食物连自己和托托吃一天都不太够。

她吃完早餐，正要回到黄砖路上，突然附近传来一声低沉的呻吟，她吓了一跳。

“什么声音？”她怯怯地问。

“我想不出来，”稻草人回答，“但我们可以去看看。”

就在这时，又是一声呻吟，似乎就从身后传来。他们转回身，在森林里又走了几步，这时，多萝西发现一束阳光照进林间，把什么东西照得闪闪发亮。她朝那儿跑过去，突然收住脚，发出轻声的惊叫。

一棵大树已经有一部分被砍断，树旁站着一个全身用铁皮做成的人，两手举着斧头。他的头、胳膊和腿都连在身上，但他站着一动不动，好像根本活动不了。

多萝西惊奇地看着铁皮人，稻草人也一样，而托托尖声叫唤，一口咬住他的腿，这硌痛了托托的牙。

“是你在呻吟吗？”多萝西问。

“是我，”铁皮人说，“是我。我已经呻吟一年多了，以前从没有人听见，也没有人来帮助我。”

“我能帮上什么忙？”多萝西柔声问道，她被铁皮人忧伤的声音感染了。

“拿来油壶，给我的关节上上油。”他答道，“我的关节锈得很厉害，一点也动弹不得；如果上足油，我马上就又好了。油壶放在我小屋里的一个架子上。”

多萝西马上跑回小木屋，找到油壶，然后跑回来，急切地问：“你的关节在哪儿？”

“先给我的脖子上油。”铁皮樵夫回答。于是，多萝西给他的脖子上了油，因为那儿锈得太厉害，所以稻草人扶住铁皮脑袋，轻轻地左右摇晃，直到脖子转动自如，铁皮人终于可以自己转头了。

“现在给我胳膊的关节上油吧。”他说。多萝西又给胳膊上油，稻草人小心翼翼地弯曲它们，直到胳膊上的锈除净，像新的一样。

铁皮樵夫满意地舒了一口气，把斧头放下，斜靠在树上。

“太舒服了。”他说，“自从锈住之后，我就一直举着斧头，我很高兴终于可以放下了。现在，如果你们给我腿上的关节上点油，我就又能正常了。”

于是，他们就给铁皮樵夫的腿上油，直到他的腿活动自如；他一再感谢他们解救了自己。铁皮樵夫看起来很有礼貌，很懂得感恩。

“要不是你们路过，我可能要在这里站一辈子，”他说，“所以你们真是救了我的命。你们怎么到这儿的？”

“我们要去翡翠城见伟大的奥兹，”多萝西回答，“在你的小木屋过了个夜。”

“你们为什么想见奥兹？”他问。

“我想请他送我回堪萨斯，稻草人想请他给自己的脑袋装些脑子。”她回答道。

铁皮樵夫似乎沉思了一会儿，然后说道：

“你觉得奥兹能给我一颗心吗？”

“哎，我觉得能，”多萝西回答，“这就像给稻草人脑子一样好办。”

“没错。”铁皮樵夫回答，“那要是你们允许我加入，我就也去翡翠城，请奥兹帮助我。”

“来吧。”稻草人热情地说。多萝西又补充说，自己很高兴有铁皮樵夫做伴。于是，铁皮樵夫扛起斧头，他们几个穿过森林，直走到铺着黄砖的路上。

铁皮樵夫已经让多萝西把油壶装进了篮子。“因为，”他说，“如果我淋了雨，又锈住了，我会非常需要油壶。”

铁皮樵夫新加入队伍，这对大家来说挺幸运的，因为他们才上路没多久，就走到一个地方，树木和树枝特别茂密，挡住道路，他们过不去了。还好，铁皮樵夫挥动斧头，卖力地劈砍，不一会儿就为大家清理出一条通道。

大家一边走，多萝西一边认真地想事，所以没注意到稻草人一脚踏进地上的坑，滚到了路旁。他只得喊多萝西扶他起来。

“你为什么不绕开坑呢？”铁皮樵夫问。

“我脑子不够使。”稻草人高兴地回答，“我的脑袋塞满了稻草，你知道的，我就是为此要去找奥兹，请他给我一些脑子。”

“噢，我明白了。”铁皮樵夫说，“可是脑子毕竟不是世界上最好的东西。”

“你有脑子吗？”稻草人问。

“没有，我脑袋空空，”樵夫回答，“但我曾经有脑子，也有一颗心；所以，我两样都尝试过，我宁愿有一颗心。”

“那是为什么？”稻草人问。

“我给你讲讲我的故事，你就知道了。”

于是，他们在森林里走着，铁皮樵夫讲起了下面的故事：

“我是一个樵夫的儿子，他在森林里砍树，然后把木头卖掉，以此为生。我长大后，也成了一名樵夫。父亲去世后，我照顾老母亲，直到她也去世。后来，我打定主意要结婚，而不是独自生活，这样就不会孤单了。

“有一位芒奇金姑娘，她非常美貌，我很快就一心一意地爱上了她。她答应，只要我攒够钱，能给她建一栋好一点的房子，她就嫁给我；所以，我开始比以前更卖力地干活儿。可是，姑娘和一个老妇人一起生活，那老妇人不想让姑娘嫁给任何人，因为她自己太懒了，希望姑娘留在身边，给她煮饭、做家务。所以，老妇人去找邪恶的东方女巫，许诺要是女巫阻止了这桩婚事，就给女巫两只羊和一头牛。于是，邪恶的女巫对我的斧头施了魔法。有一天，我正在奋力砍树，因为我急着要尽快建新房、讨媳妇，这时，斧头突然从手中滑落，砍掉了我的左腿。

“一开始，这似乎特别不幸，因为我知道一个独腿的人做不好伐木工。于是，我找到一位铁匠，让他用铁皮给我做了一条新腿。我一适应这条铁皮腿，它就活动自如了。可我的做法惹恼了邪恶的东方女巫，因为她许诺那老妇人，要让我娶不了漂亮的芒奇金姑娘。后来，我又开始砍树时，斧头滑落，砍掉了我的右腿。我又去找铁匠，他又给我装了一条铁皮腿。这之后，被施了魔咒的斧头又先后砍掉了我的两条胳膊；但这没什么可怕的，我把它们换成了铁皮的。后来，邪恶的女巫又让我的斧头滑落，这次把我的脑袋砍了下来。起初，我以为自己完了。但铁匠碰巧路过，他给我装上了新的铁皮脑袋。

“那时，我以为自己已经打败了邪恶女巫，干活儿比以前更卖劲了；但是我想不到自己的敌人多么残忍。她想出了一个新办法，来消灭我对芒奇金姑娘的爱。她让我的斧头再次滑落，这次斧头正划过我的身体，把我劈成两半。铁匠又来帮忙，他给我做了一个铁皮身体，用关节把我的铁皮胳膊、腿还有脑袋固定到身上，这样我就能像以前一样活动自如。可是，唉！我现在没有心了，所以我不再爱那个芒奇金姑娘，不在乎和不和她结婚。我想，她还和那老妇人住在一起，等着我去娶她。

“我的身体在阳光下闪闪发亮，我对此很骄傲，这下斧头滑落也不要紧了，因为它不能割伤我。只有一个危险，就是我的关节会生锈；但我的小木屋里一直放着一只油壶，我留心在需要的时候给自己上油。然而，有一天我忘记上油，而且遇上了暴风雨，没等我意识到危险，我的关节就锈住了，于是我只能站在林子里，直到你们过来帮忙。这经历非常可怕，但我在这里站了一年，有的是时间思考，我想自己最大的损失是失去了心。恋爱时，我是世上最快乐的人；但谁也不会爱一个没有心的人，所以我决定去找奥兹，请他给我一颗心。如果他给我一颗心，我就回去娶芒奇金姑娘。”

多萝西和稻草人都对铁皮樵夫的故事很有兴趣，现在他们知道了为什么他这么急着要得到一颗心。

稻草人说：“我仍然要脑子而不是心；因为一个傻子就算有一颗心，他也不知道能做什么。”

“我要心，”铁皮樵夫说，“因为脑子不能让人快乐，而快乐是世上最美好的东西。”

多萝西什么也没说，因为她搞不清两位朋友谁说得对。她决定只要自己能回到堪萨斯，回到艾姆婶婶身边，那樵夫没有脑子而稻草人没有心，或者他们都得到自己想要的，就不那么要紧了。

多萝西最担心的是，面包只剩下一点，她和托托再吃一顿，篮子就空了。樵夫和稻草人确实什么也不吃，但她不是用铁皮或者稻草做的，不吃东西可活不下去。





第六章　胆小狮


这段时间，多萝西和她的伙伴们一直走在密林中。这条路还是铺着黄砖，但被厚厚的枯枝败叶覆盖，所以一点也不好走。

这一带森林中，鸟儿很少，因为它们喜欢阳光充足的旷野。可时不时，藏身茂密树丛中的野兽会发出一声低沉的吼叫。小女孩听到这声音，吓得心怦怦急跳，她不知道这是什么东西发出的；然而，托托知道，它紧贴着多萝西腿边走，都不敢叫一声来回应。

“还有多久，”小女孩问铁皮樵夫，“我们才能走出森林？”

“不知道，”铁皮樵夫回答，“我从没去过翡翠城。不过，我爸爸去过一次，那时候我还小。他说路途遥远，要穿过一片危险的区域，虽然奥兹住的那座城附近风景很美。不过只要带上油壶，我就不怕，什么也伤害不到稻草人，而你的额头上有好女巫的吻痕，它能保护你不受伤害。”

“可是，托托！”小女孩焦急地说，“什么来保护它？”

“要是他遇上危险，我们就得亲自保护它。”铁皮樵夫答道。

话音未落，森林中传来一声可怕的嘶吼，接着，一头大狮子跳到路上。他一挥爪子，稻草人就被打倒，骨碌碌滚到路边，然后他用锋利的爪子攻击铁皮樵夫。樵夫被打翻在地，一动不动，可是令狮子大吃一惊的是，铁皮上一点爪印也没有。

小托托现在要面对敌人了，它吠叫着冲向狮子。那只大野兽张嘴就要咬小狗，多萝西害怕托托被咬死，就不顾危险，冲上前照着狮子的鼻子就是狠狠一巴掌，同时还喊叫道：

“你敢咬托托！你应该感到羞愧，像你这样的大家伙，居然咬一只可怜的小狗！”

“我没咬它。”狮子一边争辩，一边用爪子揉被多萝西打中的鼻子。

“没咬着，但是你想。”她反驳道，“你只不过是个大个头的胆小鬼。”

“我知道，”狮子说，羞愧地低下头，“我一直都知道。但我能怎么办？”

“我不知道，我肯定。想想吧，你竟然打一个可怜的稻草填充的人！”

“他是填充的？”狮子惊奇地问，他看着多萝西捡起稻草人，把他两脚立起来，拍打几下，稻草人恢复了原来的样子。

“他当然是填充的。”多萝西说，她气还没消。

“难怪他那么容易翻倒。”狮子说，“看他那样骨碌碌滚，我心里很吃惊。另一个也是填充的吗？”

“不，他是铁做的。”多萝西说着，扶起樵夫。

“所以他差点磨钝我的爪子，”狮子说，“我听到刮铁皮的声音，就脊背发凉。这是什么小动物，你这么护着它？”

“它是我的狗，托托。”多萝西说。

“它是铁做的，还是填充的？”狮子问。

“都不是。它是一只，呃，一只有血有肉的狗。”

“噢！它是个稀奇的家伙，我看看，个头可真小。没有谁会想咬这小不点儿，除了我这种胆小鬼。”狮子伤心地继续说。

“什么使你胆小？”多萝西好奇地望着这头大野兽，他跟小马一般大。

“这是个谜，”狮子回答，“我想我生来就这样。森林里所有的动物都很自然地觉得，我应该很勇敢，因为无论在哪里，狮子都被认为是万兽之王。我知道，如果我大声吼叫，所有的活物都会害怕，四散奔逃。每次我遇到一个人，都害怕极了；但我只要冲他吼，他就飞奔逃命去了。如果大象、老虎、熊想要和我打架，我就会自己逃跑。我就是个胆小鬼；但大家一听到我的吼声，就全要逃跑，而我当然会放它们走。”

“但这不对啊。万兽之王不应该是胆小鬼。”稻草人说。

“我知道，”狮子说着，用尾巴尖擦去一滴眼泪，“这件事让我非常伤心，生活很不快乐。但每次一遇到危险，我就开始心跳加速。”

“也许你有心脏病。”铁皮樵夫说。

“有可能。”狮子说。

“真是这样的话，”铁皮樵夫接着说，“你应该高兴，因为这证明你有一颗心。而我，我没有心；所以我得不了心脏病。”

“有可能，”狮子若有所思，“如果没有心，我就不会胆小。”

“你有脑子吗？”稻草人问。

“我想我有。我从来没想过要脑子。”狮子回答。

“我要去找伟大的奥兹，请他给我脑子，”稻草人说，“因为我的脑袋里填满了稻草。”

“我要请他给我一颗心。”樵夫说。

“我要请他把我和托托送回堪萨斯。”多萝西说。

“你们觉得奥兹能给我胆量吗？”胆小狮问。

“就跟他能给我脑子一样容易。”稻草人说。

“跟给我一颗心一样容易。”铁皮樵夫说。

“跟送我回堪萨斯一样。”多萝西说。

“那如果你们不介意，我想和你们一起去，”狮子说，“因为一丁点勇气也没有，我的生活无法忍受。”

“非常欢迎你，”多萝西说，“因为你可以帮忙赶走别的野兽。在我看来，它们如果那么轻易被你吓走，就肯定比你还胆小。”

“它们确实更胆小，”狮子说，“但那不能让我更勇敢。只要知道自己是个胆小鬼，我就不会开心。”

于是，这几个小伙伴又上路了，狮子威严地大步走在多萝西身旁。托托一开始不赞成这个新伙伴加入，因为他忘不了自己差点被狮子的大牙咬碎。过了一段时间，他感觉更自在了一些，而现在托托和胆小狮已经成了好朋友。

那天余下的时间里，没有其他危险来破坏他们平静的旅途。只是有一次，铁皮樵夫踩上一只沿路爬行的甲虫，要了这可怜的小家伙的命。这让铁皮樵夫很不开心，因为他总是注意不伤害任何生命；他一边走，一边流出几滴伤心悔恨的泪。泪水从他脸上缓缓流下，流到下巴的关节上，关节锈住了。过了一会儿，多萝西问铁皮樵夫一个问题，他张不开嘴，因为他的下巴牢牢地锈住了。铁皮樵夫害怕极了，朝多萝西打了很多次手势，请她解救自己，可是多萝西没有看懂。狮子也莫名其妙，不知道出了什么事。这时，稻草人从多萝西的篮子里拿出油壶，给铁皮樵夫的下巴上了油，于是不一会儿，樵夫就能和从前一样自如地说话了。

“这给我一个教训，”他说，“当心脚下。因为要是我再踩上一只甲虫，我肯定还会哭，泪水会把我的下巴锈住，我就不能讲话了。”

从此，他走路非常小心，眼睛盯着路面。有一次，他看见一只小蚂蚁艰辛地爬过，他就迈过去，不伤害小蚂蚁。铁皮樵夫很清楚自己没有心，所以非常注意绝不对任何东西冷酷残忍。

“你们这些有心的人，”他说，“有东西指引你们，你们永远不会做错事；但我没有心，所以我得特别小心。等奥兹给我一颗心，我当然就不用这么小心了。”





第七章　寻找伟大的奥兹的旅程


那天晚上，因为附近没有房子，他们只好在森林里一棵大树下露营。树冠像一个密实的盖子，为他们遮挡露水。铁皮樵夫用斧头砍了一大堆木头，多萝西搭起熊熊燃烧的火堆，她暖和起来，也觉得没有那么孤独了。她和托托吃完了最后几片面包，现在她不知道早餐怎么办。

“如果你愿意，”狮子说，“我就到森林里去，给你逮一头鹿。你可以烤着吃，因为你的口味很奇怪，喜欢熟食。那样，你能美美地吃一顿早餐。”

“别！千万别！”铁皮樵夫恳求道，“如果你杀死一头可怜的鹿，我肯定会哭的，那我的下巴就又要生锈。”

但狮子还是走进森林，为自己寻食。谁也不知道他吃了什么，因为他自己没提。稻草人找到一棵挂满坚果的树，他给多萝西装了满满一篮子坚果，这样她很久都不会挨饿了。多萝西觉得稻草人善良又周到，可看到这可怜的家伙笨手笨脚摘果子的样子，她还是放声大笑。他那稻草填充的手笨拙极了，坚果又那么小，所以掉在地上的果子和装进篮子的几乎一样多。但稻草人不在乎花多久才能装满篮子，因为这让他可以远离火堆，他害怕火星会蹦进身上的稻草，把他烧着。所以，他离火堆远远的，只是在多萝西睡着后给她盖上干树叶时，才靠近火堆。多萝西盖着这些树叶，舒服又温暖，她一觉睡到了早上。

天亮后，小姑娘在潺潺的溪水中洗好脸。很快，他们又朝翡翠城出发了。

这一天，他们将遇上很多事。他们才走了不到一小时，面前就出现一条壕沟，切断了道路，把他们能看见的森林一分为二。这是一条很宽的沟。他们爬到沟边，朝下张望，发现壕沟很深，沟底布满棱角尖锐的巨石。壕沟两侧非常陡，他们谁也爬不下去。一时间，他们以为旅途似乎要到此为止了。

“我们怎么办？”多萝西绝望地问。

“我一点主意也没有。”铁皮樵夫说。狮子摇着蓬松杂乱的鬃毛，若有所思。但稻草人说：

“我们不会飞，这点是肯定的。我们也不能爬下这条大沟。所以，如果我们不能跳过去的话，就只能停在这里了。”

“我想我能跳过去。”胆小狮在心里仔细估量壕沟的宽度之后，说道。

“那咱们就好办了，”稻草人答道，“你可以把我们都背在背上，一次一个带过去。”

“好，我试一试。”狮子说，“谁第一个？”

“我来，”稻草人表示，“因为要是你发现自己跳不过壕沟，那多萝西就会摔死，铁皮樵夫会碰到下面的巨石，撞得凹凸不平。但如果你背的是我，就不要紧，因为我就算摔下去，也不会受伤。”

“我自己很害怕掉下去，”胆小狮说，“但我想没有别的办法，只有试一试。所以，到我背上来，我们试一试。”

稻草人骑到狮子背上，这个大家伙走到壕沟边，蹲了下来。

“你为什么不助跑然后起跳呢？”稻草人问。

“因为我们狮子不是那样做的。”狮子说完，纵身一跃，轻盈地划过空中，稳稳地落在壕沟对面。大家看到狮子这么轻松地跳过去，都非常开心。稻草人从狮子背上下来后，狮子又跳回壕沟的这一边。

多萝西想第二个过去；于是，她怀抱着托托，爬上狮子的后背，用一只手紧紧抓住狮子的鬃毛。接下来，她感觉像在空中飞翔，还没来得及想什么，就安全地到达了壕沟对面。狮子第三次跳过壕沟，去接铁皮樵夫。然后，他们坐了一会儿，好让狮子有机会歇一歇。几次奋力跳跃之后，狮子呼吸急促，他像一只跑了很久的大狗，呼呼直喘。

他们发现壕沟这边的森林特别茂密，看起来昏暗阴沉。狮子休息好后，大家又踏上黄砖路，每个人都在心里默默地想，他们到底能不能走出这片林子，再次看到灿烂的阳光。更加让大家不安的是，不一会儿，他们就听到森林深处传来奇怪的声音，狮子悄声告诉他们，卡利达就住在这个地方。

“卡利达是什么？”小姑娘问。

“它们是巨兽，身子像熊，脑袋像老虎，”狮子回答，“爪子又长又锋利。它们可以把我撕成两半，就像我杀死托托一样容易。我怕极了卡利达。”

“我不奇怪你会怕它们，”多萝西说，“它们肯定是可怕的野兽。”

狮子正要答话，突然他们面前又出现一道大沟，切断道路。但这条沟又宽又深，狮子马上知道自己跳不过去。

于是，大家坐下来想办法。稻草人仔细思考一番，开口说：

“这里有一棵大树，长在沟边。如果铁皮樵夫能砍倒它，它就会倒向大沟那边，那我们就能很容易地从树上走过大沟。”

“这真是个好主意，”狮子说，“我差点要怀疑你脑袋里有脑子，而不是塞满稻草。”

樵夫马上动手砍树，他的斧头非常锋利，很快，树就要被砍断了。这时，狮子两只前爪抵住大树，用尽全力使劲一推，大树缓缓倾斜，接着重重地倒在沟上，树冠落在大沟对面。

大家刚走上这座奇特的桥，就听见一声尖利的吼叫。他们抬头一看，惊恐地发现两只巨大的野兽正冲他们跑来，野兽的身子像熊，脑袋像老虎。

“他们就是卡利达！”胆小狮说着，开始颤抖。

“快！”稻草人大喊，“咱们快过去。”

于是，多萝西打头，怀里抱着托托，铁皮樵夫跟在她身后，再后面是稻草人。虽然狮子确实很害怕，但他还是转身面对卡利达，发出一声洪亮可怕的吼叫。这一吼吓得多萝西尖声喊叫，稻草人仰面跌倒，就连凶恶的野兽也猛地站住，吃惊地看着狮子。

但它们看出自己比狮子个头大，还想起它们有两个，而狮子是一个，就又冲上来。狮子从大树上跑到沟对面，转身看它们接下来要怎样。凶恶的野兽一刻没停，也跑上大树。狮子对多萝西说：

“我们完了。它们肯定会用锋利的爪子把我们撕碎。站在我身后，靠紧我，我来和它们拼死一战。”

“等等！”稻草人喊道。他刚才在考虑最好的办法是什么，现在他让樵夫砍掉他们这边的树冠。铁皮樵夫立刻亮出斧头，眼看两头卡利达马上要过沟，大树轰隆一声掉进深沟，两只咆哮着的丑陋野兽也跟着摔了下去，在沟底尖锐的巨石上粉身碎骨。

“好了，”胆小狮长长地松了一口气，“我看咱们又能再多活一会儿，我很开心，因为不能活肯定让人很难受。这些野兽吓死我了，我的心现在还怦怦跳。”

“啊，”铁皮樵夫伤心地说，“我真想有颗心可以跳动。”

这番冒险的经历之后，几个旅行者要走出森林的心情比之前更加急切了，于是他们步子飞快，多萝西走累了，只好骑到狮子背上。他们很开心的是，越往前走，树木越稀疏。午后，他们突然来到一条水流湍急的大河边。河对岸，看得见黄砖路穿过一片美丽的原野，翠绿的草坪上绚烂的花儿星星点点，路边的树木挂满鲜美的果子。他们望见面前的美丽景色，满心欢喜。

“我们怎么过河？”多萝西问。

“那很容易。”稻草人回答，“铁皮樵夫得造一条木筏，这样我们就能漂到对岸去。”

于是，铁皮樵夫拿起斧头，动手砍倒小树，制作木筏。他正忙活着，稻草人在河岸上找到一棵结满甜美果子的树。多萝西很开心，因为她已经吃了一天的坚果，现在她美美地吃了一顿成熟的水果。

可是，制作木筏很花时间，即使铁皮樵夫这么勤劳而不知疲倦，夜幕降临的时候，木筏还是没有完工。于是，大家在树下找了一块舒适的地方，一直安睡到天亮。夜里，多萝西梦到翡翠城，还有好巫师奥兹，他马上就要送她回家。





第八章　要命的罂粟花田


第二天早晨，我们这一小队旅行者醒来，精力充沛，满怀希望。多萝西像个公主一样吃早餐，食物是从河边树上摘来的桃子和李子。他们身后是阴暗的森林，虽然他们经历了许多挫折，但已经安然通过；他们面前则是一片阳光照耀的美丽原野，像在召唤他们继续去往翡翠城。

现在，宽阔的大河把他们和这美丽的土地隔开。但木筏就要做好了，铁皮樵夫又砍了几根圆木，用木钉把它们固定在一起，这样，他们可以上路了。多萝西坐在木筏正中，抱着托托；胆小狮一上来，木筏就倾斜得厉害，因为他个头大，身子重；稻草人和铁皮樵夫站在木筏的另一头，好稳住木筏，他俩手握长杆，撑着木筏过河。

起初，他们行进得很顺利，但到河中央时，湍急的水流把木筏往下游冲去，离黄砖路越来越远。河水也越来越深，长杆够不着河底。

“这不妙，”铁皮樵夫说，“如果我们靠不了岸，就会被带到邪恶的西方女巫的国度，她会给我们施咒，让我们成为她的奴隶。”

“那我就得不到脑子了。”稻草人说。

“那我就得不到胆量了。”胆小狮说。

“那我就得不到心了。”铁皮樵夫说。

“那我就永远也不能回堪萨斯了。”多萝西说。

“如果我们能够，就一定要去翡翠城。”稻草人接着说，他使劲一撑长杆，不料长杆牢牢地卡进了河底的淤泥。他还没来得及拔出长杆或者松手，木筏已被大水冲走。可怜的稻草人紧紧抱住长杆，留在了河中央。

“再见！”稻草人冲着他们的背影大喊。大家只好非常伤心地离开了他。铁皮樵夫真的要哭了，幸好他记起自己会生锈，于是在多萝西的围裙上擦干眼泪。

这件事对稻草人来说，确实够糟糕的。

“我现在比当初见到多萝西的时候更不幸，”他想，“那时候，我被绑在玉米地里的一根竿子上，不管怎么说，还能装装样子，吓唬乌鸦。可是被困在河中央木杆上的稻草人，肯定什么用也没有。恐怕我永远不会得到脑子了！”

木筏向河下游漂去，可怜的稻草人被远远落在后面。这时，狮子说：

“我们必须采取点行动来自救。我想我可以拖着木筏游到岸边，你们只要抓住我的尾巴尖就行。”

于是，狮子纵身跳下水，铁皮樵夫紧紧抓住他的尾巴。接着，狮子使出全部的劲朝岸边游去。他个头很大，但游起来仍然很费力；一点一点地，狮子把大家拖出了激流。多萝西拿起铁皮樵夫的长杆，帮着把木筏推上岸。

最后，大家终于到岸，踏上美丽的绿草坪。每个人都筋疲力尽，也知道他们被水流冲向下游，远离了去往翡翠城的黄砖路。

“我们现在怎么办？”铁皮樵夫问。这时，狮子正躺在草地上，让太阳把自己晒干。

“我们得想个办法，回到黄砖路。”多萝西说。

“最好的办法就是沿着河岸走，直到我们回到那条路。”狮子说。

于是，他们休息好之后，多萝西拎起篮子，大家沿着草色青青的河岸，去往他们被河水冲走之前走的那条路。这是一片美丽的乡野，处处是赏心悦目的鲜花、果树和阳光。要不是为稻草人伤心的话，他们本来会非常开心的。

他们以最快的速度赶路，多萝西只停下来一回，去摘一朵美丽的花儿。过了一会儿，铁皮樵夫喊道：

“看呐！”

大家闻声向河面望去，只见稻草人在河中央紧紧抱着长杆，看起来孤独而忧伤。

“我们怎样才能救他？”多萝西问。

狮子和樵夫都摇摇头，想不出办法。他们坐在岸边，发愁地盯着稻草人，这时飞来一只鹳，她发现了他们，于是在水边停下来歇息。

“你们是什么人，要往哪里去？”鹳问道。

“我叫多萝西，”小姑娘回答，“这两位是我的朋友，铁皮樵夫和胆小狮；我们要去翡翠城。”

“不是这条路。”鹳说，她扭动长长的脖子，机警地看着三个奇怪的家伙。

“我明白，”多萝西回答，“可是我们失去了稻草人，不知道怎样救他回来。”

“他在哪儿？”鹳问。

“在那边河里。”小姑娘回答。

“要是他个头不这么大、身子不这么重，我就帮你们把他救回来。”鹳说。

“他一点都不重，”多萝西急忙说，“因为他是用稻草填充的；如果你能把他带回到我们身边，我们会永远感激不尽。”

“好吧，我试试，”鹳说，“可要是我觉得他太重带不动，我就得把他又抛回河里。”

于是，大鸟飞上天空，掠过河面，直飞到抱着长杆的稻草人身旁。她用大爪子抓起稻草人的胳膊，把他带到空中，送回多萝西、狮子、铁皮樵夫和托托坐着的河岸上。

稻草人见自己又与朋友们团聚了，他高兴得拥抱了所有人，连狮子和托托也拥抱了；大家往前走，稻草人每走一步都唱着“托—得—日—得—噢！”，他快活极了。

“我还以为我要永远待在河里了，”他说，“想不到好心的鹳救了我。要是我有了脑子，我一定去找她，做点什么事报答她。”

“不客气。”鹳在一旁飞，与他们一起往前走，“无论谁遇到困难，我总乐意帮忙。可我得走了，孩子们还在窝里等我回去呢。祝你们找到翡翠城，得到奥兹的帮助。”

“谢谢。”多萝西说。随后，好心的鹳飞上天空，一会儿就飞远不见了。

大家往前赶路，羽毛艳丽的鸟儿们的歌声在耳畔唱响，美丽的鲜花在面前盛开，这些花非常繁茂，像在地上铺了一层花毯。除了硕大的黄花、白花、蓝花、紫花，还有一大丛一大丛鲜红夺目的罂粟花，简直让多萝西看花眼。

“这些花儿美吧？”小姑娘深吸一口花朵浓郁的香气，问道。

“美。”稻草人回答道，“等我有了脑子，我应该会更喜欢这些花。”

“要是我有一颗心，我会喜欢的。”铁皮樵夫说。

“我一直很喜欢花，”狮子说，“它们的样子多么无助、脆弱。可森林里的花都没有这么鲜艳。”

他们越往前走，鲜红的大罂粟花越多，别的花越少；不久，他们发现自己走进了一大片罂粟花田。现在，众所周知，这些花多了香味会特别强烈，人闻到就昏睡，如果没有被从花香里抬出来，就会永远睡下去。可多萝西不知道这回事，而且她也摆脱不了遍地都是的鲜红罂粟花；所以不一会儿，她就眼皮发沉，觉得必须坐下来休息睡一觉。

但铁皮樵夫不让多萝西停下来。

“我们得快点走，在天黑前赶回到黄砖路上。”他说。稻草人同意樵夫的想法。因此，他们继续赶路，直到多萝西再也站不起来，眼睛不由自主地闭上了。她忘了自己在哪里，倒在罂粟花丛中，熟睡过去。

“我们该怎么办？”铁皮樵夫问。

“要是把她留在这里，她一定会没命的，”狮子说，“我们都要被花要了命去。我自己也快睁不开眼了，而狗已经睡着了。”

没错，托托已经睡倒在小主人身边。只有稻草人和铁皮樵夫没被花香熏倒，因为他俩不是血肉之躯。

“快跑，”稻草人对狮子说，“你能跑多快就跑多快，赶紧跑出这片要命的花田。我们会把小姑娘抬出去，可是你个头太大，我们抬不动。”

狮子听到这话，挣扎起身，奋力往前跳跃。不一会儿，他就跑远了。

“我们用手搭成一把椅子抬她。”稻草人说。他们抱起托托，放在多萝西的膝头，然后用手当座位，胳膊当扶手，搭成一把椅子，抬着熟睡的小姑娘穿过花田。

他们走啊走啊，要命的罂粟花连成一片大花毯，包围着他们，似乎永远走不到头。他们沿着河弯走，最后终于遇到了睡倒在罂粟花中的狮子。原来花香太浓，这个大家伙也终于受不住，在离花田尽头不远的地方倒下了，前头就是一片芳草青青的美丽田野。

“我们帮不了他，”铁皮樵夫伤心地说，“他太重，我们抬不动。我们不得不让他留在这里，永远睡下去，也许他会梦见自己终于拥有了胆量。”

“我很难过，”稻草人说，“狮子虽然胆小，却是一个好伙伴。我们还是走吧。”

他们把睡着的小姑娘抬到河边一处美丽的地方，这里远离罂粟花田，再也吸不到有毒的花香。他们把多萝西轻轻放在柔软的草地上，等着清新的微风唤醒她。





第九章　田鼠女王


“我们现在离黄砖路不会很远了，”稻草人站在小姑娘身边说，“因为我们走的路差不多有河水冲走我们那么远。”

铁皮樵夫正要答话，突然听到一声低沉的吼叫，他转头（头靠脖子关节旋转得很优美）看见一头奇怪的野兽跳过草丛，朝他们奔来。这其实是一只巨大的黄色野猫。樵夫想它一定是在追赶什么，因为它的耳朵紧贴着脑袋，嘴巴大张，露出两排难看的牙齿，血红的眼睛像燃烧的火球。野猫越来越近，铁皮樵夫看到跑在它前面的是一只灰色的小田鼠。尽管樵夫没有心，但他还是知道野猫想要杀死这样一个漂亮、无辜的小东西是不对的。

于是樵夫举起斧头，趁野猫跑过，迅速地一挥，这野兽的头就被齐刷刷地从身子上砍下来，骨碌碌滚到他脚边，碎成两半。

田鼠终于摆脱了敌人，突然收住脚，慢慢走到樵夫身边，用尖细微小的声音说：

“噢，谢谢！万分感谢你救了我一命。”

“请千万别这么说。”樵夫答道，“我没有心，所以就留意帮助那些可能需要朋友的人，哪怕那只是一只老鼠。”

“只是一只老鼠！”小家伙气愤地叫道，“我可是女王，所有田鼠的女王！”

“噢，是的。”樵夫说着，鞠了一个躬。

“所以你救了我一命，这是崇高之举，也是勇敢之举。”女王补充道。

这时，樵夫他们看见一些田鼠飞快地迈动小腿跑来，一看到他们的女王，就喊叫起来：

“噢，陛下，我们以为您被害了！您是怎么从那只大野猫那里逃脱的？”他们冲着小小的女王深深鞠躬，脑袋低得都要碰到地面了。

“是这位有趣的铁皮人，”女王说，“杀死野猫，救了我一命。所以，从今以后，你们都要为他效力，遵从他的意思。”

“遵命！”所有的田鼠齐声尖叫。接着，他们突然四散奔逃。原来托托睡醒了，看见身边围着一群田鼠，高兴地叫了一声，跳进这群田鼠中间。托托在堪萨斯的时候，就一直喜欢追田鼠，它看不出这会伤害谁。

铁皮樵夫把狗抱起来，紧紧搂住，然后对田鼠说：“回来吧！回来吧！托托不会伤害你们的。”

听到这话，田鼠女王从一丛青草下面探出脑袋，怯怯地问：

“你确定他不会咬我们？”

“我不会放开它的，”樵夫说，“你们别害怕。”

田鼠们小心地一只接一只爬回来。托托不再吠叫，但它想挣脱樵夫的胳膊，要不是非常清楚樵夫是铁皮做的，就要咬他一口了。最后，一只最大的田鼠开口了。

“你救了我们的女王一命，”他说，“我们能做点什么来报答你吗？”

“我想不出有什么。”樵夫说。稻草人努力地想，也想不出来，因为他的脑袋里塞满稻草。于是，他脱口而出：

“噢，是的。你们可以救我们的朋友胆小狮，他睡在罂粟花田里。”

“一头狮子！”小女王叫道，“天啊，他会把我们吃光的。”

“噢，不会的，”稻草人声明，“这头狮子是个胆小鬼。”

“真的？”大田鼠问。

“是他自己这么说的，”稻草人回答，“而且他绝不会伤害我们的朋友。如果你们帮我们救他，我保证他会对你们大家很友好。”

“那好，”女王说，“我们相信你。但我们该怎么做？”

“这里有很多称你为女王、愿意听你命令的田鼠吗？”

“噢，是的，有几千只呢。”女王回答。

“那请你叫所有田鼠都尽快过来，每只都带一根长绳。”

女王转身吩咐服侍她的田鼠们，让他们立即去召集所有的臣民。他们一听到女王的命令，就飞快地四散跑开。

“现在，”稻草人对铁皮樵夫说，“你必须到河边的树林去，做一辆搬运狮子的推车。”

樵夫一听就立刻到树林去，忙活起来；不一会儿，他就用大树枝做好一辆推车。他砍去大树枝上所有的树叶和枝杈，用木钉把大树枝钉在一起，又把一根大树干截成四段做车轮。他干得又快又漂亮，等田鼠们开始陆陆续续地到达时，推车已经做好了。

田鼠从四面八方过来，有好几千只：大田鼠、小田鼠，还有不大不小的田鼠；他们每只的嘴里都衔着一条长绳。就在这时，多萝西从长长的睡梦中醒来，睁开眼。她发现自己躺在草地上，身边站着几千只胆怯地望着她的田鼠，大吃一惊。稻草人给她讲了事情的所有经过，然后转身对着那只威严的小田鼠，说：

“请允许我给你介绍女王陛下。”

多萝西严肃地点点头，女王行了一个屈膝礼，随后她待小姑娘十分友善。

稻草人和樵夫这时开始用田鼠们带来的绳子，把他们套上推车。每条绳子都是一头绕住田鼠的脖子，另一头系在推车上。当然，推车比每一只拉它的田鼠都大一千倍，但所有的田鼠一齐使劲，就能轻易拉动推车。连稻草人和铁皮樵夫都能坐在推车上，由他们的这群奇异的小马拉着，迅速地去往狮子睡着的地方。

大家费了好大劲，才把狮子抬上车，因为他太重了。随后，女王急忙命令她的臣民开始拉车，因为她害怕田鼠们在罂粟花田里待久了，也会睡着。

一开始，这些小家伙虽然数目很多，但还是不大拉得动载着狮子的沉重推车。幸好樵夫和稻草人从后面推，才减轻了他们的负担。很快，他们拉着狮子出了罂粟花田，狮子才终于又能呼吸到清凉的新鲜空气，而不是花的毒气了。

多萝西迎上来，热情地感谢小田鼠们救了她的同伴一命。她这时已经非常喜欢大狮子，很高兴他获救了。

随后，田鼠们被从推车上解下来，他们蹦蹦跳跳地穿过草丛，各自回家了。田鼠女王一直待到最后。

“要是你们还需要我们帮助，”她说，“就到田野里喊一声，我们听见就会来帮忙。再见！”

“再见！”大家齐声回应。女王跑走了。这时，多萝西紧紧抱住托托，怕它去追赶女王，把她吓着。

大家送走田鼠女王，坐到狮子身边，等着他醒来；稻草人从附近一棵树上摘下水果，给多萝西做晚餐。





第十章　守门人


过了好一会儿，胆小狮才醒来，因为他在罂粟花田躺得太久，吸入了罂粟花致命的香气；当他终于睁开眼，从推车上滚下来的时候，他发现自己还活着，高兴极了。

“我拼命地跑，”他坐下来，打着哈欠说，“但是花香对我来说太浓烈。你们是怎么把我弄出来的？”

于是，他们跟他说起田鼠，说起他们怎样慷慨地救了他一命。胆小狮听完，大笑着说：

“我总是以为自己个头大、样子吓人；可是像花儿这样的小东西竟差点要了我的命，而像田鼠这样的小家伙竟又救活了我。这一切多么奇怪啊！可是，伙伴们，现在我们该怎么办？”

“我们必须继续赶路，直到再找到黄砖路，”多萝西说，“然后，我们才能接着往翡翠城去。”

于是，狮子重又神清气爽，精神抖擞，大家都起身上路，走过柔软、清新的草地，满心喜悦。没走多久，他们就到了黄砖路上，随后又转向伟大的奥兹居住的翡翠城的方向前进。

现在，道路通顺而平坦，四周是乡野美景，因此这队旅行者很高兴将森林远远留在身后，也将在它那阴森森的暗影里遇到的许多艰难险阻远远留在身后。他们又能看见路旁围着篱笆，但这些篱笆漆成了绿色；他们走过一所里面显然住着农民的小屋，它也是绿色的。下午的时候，他们路过了好几所这样的房子，有时人们站在门口，仿佛带着疑问般地望着他们；但没有谁走过来或者对他们说话，因为他们非常害怕大狮子。这地方的人都穿着漂亮的翡翠绿色衣服，戴着芒奇金人那样的尖帽。

“这一定是奥兹国，”多萝西说，“我们肯定离翡翠城不远了。”

“是的。”稻草人回答，“这里所有东西都是绿色的，而在芒奇金国，人们最喜欢蓝色。可是这里的人似乎不像芒奇金人一样友好，我们恐怕找不到地方过夜。”

“我想吃点水果以外的东西，”小姑娘说，“托托肯定也快饿得不行了。我们在下一所房子停一下，和人们说说话吧。”

于是，当他们走到一所大农舍时，多萝西勇敢地上前敲门。一个女人把门打开一道缝，刚够伸出脑袋。她问：

“孩子，你想要什么？那头大狮子为什么和你在一起？”

“如果你允许的话，我们想在你家过夜。”多萝西回答，“狮子是我的朋友和伙伴，他绝对不会伤害你。”

“他温顺吗？”女人一边问，一边把门缝开大了一些。

“噢，是的，”小姑娘说，“他胆子还特别小。你怕他，可他更怕你呢。”

“好吧，”女人仔细想了想，又瞥了一眼狮子，才说，“要是这样的话，你们可以进来，我给你们提供晚餐和睡觉的地方。”

于是，他们都进了房子。这家除了那女人，还有两个孩子和一个男人。男人伤着了腿，正躺在屋角的沙发上。这家人看见这群奇怪的人，好像非常吃惊。那女人忙着摆饭桌的时候，那男人问道：

“你们都要往哪儿去？”

“往翡翠城去，”多萝西说，“去见伟大的奥兹。”

“噢，真的！”男人惊叫道，“你们确定奥兹会见你们吗？”

“为什么不见？”多萝西反问。

“为什么？因为据说他从来不见任何人。我去过翡翠城很多次，那是一个美丽奇妙的地方；但我从来没有获准拜见伟大的奥兹，我也没听说有哪个在世的人见过他。”

“他从来不出门吗？”稻草人问。

“从不。他日复一日地坐在宫殿中的大觐见室里，就连那些服侍他的人也没有见过他的面。”

“他长什么样？”小姑娘问。

“这很难说。”男人若有所思地说，“你知道，奥兹是一位伟大的巫师，他想变成什么样子就能变成什么样子。所以，有些人说他像一只鸟，有些人说他像一头大象，有些人说他像一只猫。对另一些人，他以美丽的仙女，或者小精灵，或者他喜欢的任何其他样子出现。但是奥兹本人是谁，哪个才是他真正的样子，在世的人谁也不知道。”

“这非常奇怪，”多萝西说，“但我们还是得试一试，想办法见到他，不然我们这趟旅程将一无所获。”

“你们为什么想见可怕的奥兹？”男人问。

“我想请他给我一些脑子。”稻草人急切地说。

“噢，这个奥兹轻而易举就能做到，”男人说，“他拥有的脑子，比他需要的多。”

“我想请他给我一颗心。”铁皮樵夫说。

“这对他来说，一点都不费事，”男人接着说，“因为奥兹收藏了很多心，各种大小和形状的他都有。”

“我想请他给我胆子。”胆小狮说。

“奥兹的觐见室里有一大罐胆子，”男人说，“他用一只金盘子盖住罐口，好不让胆子流出来。他会很高兴给你一些的。”

“我想请他送我回堪萨斯。”多萝西说。

“堪萨斯在哪儿？”男人惊奇地问。

“我不知道，”多萝西伤心地说，“但我家在那里，我确定它在某一个地方。”

“很可能是这样。嗯，奥兹什么都能办到，所以我觉得他能帮你找到堪萨斯。但首先你得见着他，而这很难办到；因为这位大巫师不喜欢见任何人，他通常有自己的行事方式。那你想要什么？”他转而对托托说。托托只是摇摇尾巴；因为说来奇怪，它不会讲话。

这时，女人对他们喊：晚饭好了。于是大家都围到桌边。多萝西喝了一些美味的粥，吃了一碟炒鸡蛋、一盘白面包。她吃得很开心。狮子也喝了一些粥，但他不喜欢喝，他说粥是用燕麦做的，而燕麦是给马吃的，不是给狮子吃的。稻草人和铁皮樵夫什么也没吃。而托托每样都吃了一点，能再次吃到这样美味的晚餐，他很开心。

晚饭后，女人给多萝西安排了一张床睡觉，托托卧在多萝西身边，狮子守在房间门口，免得她受到打扰。而稻草人和铁皮樵夫站在屋子一角，虽然他们当然不能睡觉，但整晚都保持安静。

第二天清早，太阳一出来，他们就上路了，没走多久，就看见前方不远处的天空中闪着一片美丽的绿光。

“那肯定是翡翠城。”多萝西说。

他们越往前走，绿光越明亮，看起来他们终于要到达旅行目的地了。但直到下午他们才走到环绕着翡翠城的巨大墙壁前。这城墙又高又厚，颜色翠绿。

在他们前方、黄砖路的尽头，是一扇大门，上面镶满翡翠。这些翡翠在阳光下闪闪发亮，就连稻草人那画上去的眼睛都被它们的光彩晃花了。

门边有一只铃，多萝西按下按钮，就听到门内响起清脆的叮当声。接着，大门缓缓打开，大家都走进去，进入一个房间，高高的天花板是拱形的，四面的墙壁上无数翡翠灼灼闪亮。

在他们面前站着一个小人，个头和芒奇金人相当。他从头到脚穿着绿色的衣服，连皮肤都带着一丝绿色的色泽。他身边有一只绿色的大箱子。

这人见到多萝西和她的伙伴，问道：

“你们来翡翠城有什么事吗？”

“我们来这里拜见伟大的奥兹。”多萝西说。

小绿人对这回答很吃惊，他坐下仔细想了一番。

“已经很多年没人找我要拜见奥兹了。”他困惑地摇着头说，“他强大而可怕，如果你们是为无聊、愚蠢的事去打扰大巫师的智慧思考，他没准会生气，并在眨眼之间摧毁你们。”

“但我们的事并不愚蠢，也不无聊，”稻草人回答，“我们的事很重要。而且我们听说奥兹是位好心的巫师。”

“是的，”小绿人说，“他智慧而有序地统治着翡翠城。但对那些不诚实的人，或者出于好奇而接近他的人，他极其可怕，没有什么人敢要求见他的面。我是守门人，既然你们要求拜见伟大的奥兹，那我就得带你们去他的宫殿。但你们得先戴上眼镜。”

“为什么？”多萝西问。

“因为如果你们不戴眼镜，翡翠城的光辉会使你们失明。就连住在这城里的人，都要日夜戴着眼镜。按照翡翠城最初建造时奥兹的吩咐，人们的眼镜都锁上了，只有我有一把打开它们的钥匙。”

他说完打开大箱子，多萝西看见里面装满各种大小和形状的眼镜。这些眼镜镜片都是绿色的。守门人找出一副刚好适合多萝西的眼镜，给她戴上。眼镜上的两根金色带子，绕到她的脑后，由守门人用颈上链子末端的小钥匙锁住。眼镜一戴上，多萝西想摘也摘不下来，但她当然不想被翡翠城耀眼的光芒刺瞎眼睛，所以她什么也没说。

随后，守门的小绿人为稻草人、铁皮樵夫和狮子甚至托托都戴上眼镜，告诉他们他准备好带他们去宫殿了。他从墙上的钉子上取下一把金色大钥匙，打开另一扇门。于是，大家都跟着他走过大门，走进了翡翠城的街道。





第十一章　奥兹的奇妙翡翠城


即使眼睛得到绿眼镜的保护，多萝西和她的朋友们起初还是被这座奇妙之城的绚烂光彩晃花了眼。道路的两旁排列着绿色大理石建造的美丽房屋，处处点缀着闪亮的翡翠。他们走上一条同样用大理石铺成的人行道，石块间的缝隙满满当当地填着一排排的翡翠，在明亮的阳光下光彩灼灼。窗子上装着绿色玻璃；就连城市之上的天空也泛着淡淡的绿色，洒下的阳光也是绿色的。

许多人，有男有女，还有小孩，在这里来来去去。这些人都穿着绿衣服，皮肤也是浅绿色的。他们拿惊奇的目光望着多萝西和她怪模怪样的同伴，孩子们一看到狮子，都纷纷跑开，躲到母亲身后；没有一个人和他们讲话。路边有许多商店，多萝西看见里面的所有东西都是绿色的：绿色糖果、绿色爆米花，还有绿鞋、绿帽、各种绿衣服。有一家店卖绿色柠檬汁。孩子们来买柠檬汁时，多萝西发现他们付的钱也是绿色的。

这里好像没有马，没有任何动物。人们推着绿色的小车运东西。每个人看起来都幸福、满足而富裕。

守门人领他们走过一条条街，一直来到一座大房子前。这座房子在城市正中央，是大巫师奥兹的宫殿。有一名身穿绿制服、长着绿色长胡子的士兵站在门前。

“这几位外乡人，”守门人对士兵说，“请求拜见伟大的奥兹。”

“进来。”士兵回答，“我去向他禀报。”

于是，他们穿过宫殿大门，被领进一个大房间，里面铺着绿地毯，摆着镶嵌翡翠的漂亮家具。在进门之前，士兵让他们都在一只绿垫子上擦净脚底。大家落座后，士兵礼貌地说：

“请别拘束。我去觐见室门口，禀告奥兹你们来了。”

大家等了很久，士兵才终于回来。多萝西问：

“你见到奥兹了吗？”

“噢，没有。”士兵回答，“我从来没有见过他。但他坐在屏风后面，我隔着屏风和他说话，向他禀告了你们的口信。他说，如果你们这么想见他，他就恩准你们拜见；但是你们每个人要单独见他，而且每天只许一个人去。这样的话，你们就得在这宫殿住些日子了。我领你们去房间，旅行之后，你们可以在那里舒舒服服地歇息。”

“谢谢，”小姑娘回答道，“真要谢谢奥兹。”

这时，士兵吹响一只绿色的哨子，一位身穿漂亮绿丝裙的年轻姑娘立刻走进来。她长着一头美丽的绿头发和一双美丽的绿眼睛，朝多萝西深鞠一躬，说道：

“跟我来，我带你去房间。”

于是，多萝西告别朋友们，怀里抱着托托，跟随绿姑娘走过七条走廊、三段楼梯，一直来到宫殿前部的一个房间。这是世界上最可爱的小房间，房里摆着柔软舒适的床，上面是绿色丝绸床单和绿色天鹅绒被罩。房间中央有一座小小的喷泉，朝空中喷洒着绿色香水，再落回到雕刻精美的绿色大理石盆中。窗口盛开着美丽的绿色鲜花，书架上摆着一排绿色小书。多萝西有空打开这些书时，发现里面都是引她发笑的奇怪的绿色图画，有趣极了。

衣柜里挂着许多丝绸和天鹅绒料子的绿衣裙；每一件都正合多萝西的身。

“请千万别客气，”绿姑娘说，“有什么需要，你就按这个铃。奥兹明早会派人叫你。”

说完，她留下多萝西独自一人，又回到其他人那里去。她也把这些人领到各自的房间，大家都发现自己住进了宫殿里非常舒适的地方。当然，这样的礼待对稻草人是多余的；因为当房间里只剩下他一个后，他只是傻乎乎地站在门内的一个地方，一直等着天亮。就算躺下，他也得不到休息，而且他还闭不上眼睛；于是，稻草人整夜都盯着一只在屋角织网的小蜘蛛，就好像这不是世界上最好的房间一样。铁皮樵夫出于习惯在床上躺下，他记得自己还是血肉之躯时的日子；但是他睡不着，于是整夜上上下下地活动关节，以保证这些关节状态良好。狮子宁愿睡在森林中一张干树叶堆成的床上，也不喜欢被关在房间里；但他非常明智，不被这想法困扰，于是他跳上床，像猫一样蜷起身子，不到一分钟就呼呼地睡着了。

第二天早晨，吃过早餐，绿姑娘来领多萝西，她给多萝西穿上一件绿色锦缎做的最美的衣裙。多萝西围上一条绿丝绸围裙，给托托脖子上系了一条绿丝带。随后，他们出发去大巫师奥兹的觐见室。

他们首先来到一间大厅，里面有许多宫廷的淑女绅士，都穿着华美的服装。这些人无所事事，只是和彼此聊天，但他们每天早晨都来觐见室外等候，虽然他们从来没有获得准许拜见奥兹。多萝西走进大厅，大家都好奇地望着她，其中一个人轻声问：

“你真的要去面见可怕的奥兹吗？”

“当然，”多萝西回答，“如果他肯见我的话。”

“噢，他会见你的，”把多萝西的口信禀告巫师的那名士兵说，“虽然他不愿意人们求见他。实际上，他一开始很生气，说我应该把你送回你来的地方。接着，他问我你什么模样，我提起你的银鞋时，他非常感兴趣。最后，我说起你额头上的印记，他就决定准许你面见他。”

就在这时，铃响了，绿姑娘对多萝西说：

“这是信号。你必须一个人走进觐见室。”

绿姑娘打开一扇小门，多萝西勇敢地走进去。她发现自己到了一个美妙的地方。这是一个圆形的大房间，有高高的拱顶，墙面、天花板和地板上都密密麻麻地镶嵌着大颗的翡翠。穹顶中央挂着一盏大灯，像太阳一样明亮，灯光照耀下，翡翠散发着绚烂的光辉。

不过，多萝西最感兴趣的是房间中央那张绿色大理石做的大宝座。它形状像一把椅子，和所有其他东西一样，闪烁着宝石的光彩。椅子正中有一个巨大的脑袋，下面竟没有身子，也没有胳膊或者腿支撑它。这脑袋上没长头发，却长着眼睛、鼻子和嘴，它比最大的巨人的脑袋还要大。

多萝西惊恐地盯着大脑袋，这时，那双眼睛缓缓转动，敏锐而坚定地看着她。接着，那嘴巴也动了，多萝西听到一个声音说：

“我是奥兹，伟大而可怕的奥兹。你是谁，为什么找我？”

这声音没有多萝西预想的大脑袋会发出的声音那么可怕；于是她鼓起勇气，回答道：

“我是多萝西，渺小而温顺的多萝西。我是来请您帮忙的。”

那双眼睛若有所思地端详了她整整一分钟。接着，那声音说道：

“你的银鞋是从哪儿得到的？”

“我从邪恶的东方女巫那儿得到的，那会儿我的房子落在她身上，压死了她。”多萝西回答。

“你额头上的印记是怎么留下的？”那声音又问道。

“那是善良的北方女巫与我告别、送我到您这里来时吻的。”小姑娘说。

那双眼睛又一次敏锐地看着多萝西，它们看出她说的是实话。奥兹又接着问：

“你希望我做什么？”

“送我回堪萨斯吧，我的艾姆婶婶和亨利叔叔住在那里。”多萝西恳切地说，“我不喜欢您的国家，尽管它非常美丽。我离开这么久，艾姆婶婶肯定担心坏了。”

那双眼睛眨了三下，然后向上看看天花板，向下看看地面，又古怪地转动了一圈，好像看遍了觐见室的所有地方。最后，它们又望向多萝西。

“我为什么要为你做这件事？”奥兹问。

“因为您强大，我弱小；因为您是一位大巫师，而我只是一个需要帮助的小姑娘。”多萝西回答。

“可是你强大到杀死了邪恶的东方女巫。”奥兹说。

“那是凑巧的，”多萝西简单地说，“我没有办法。”

“好吧，”大脑袋说，“我来回答你。你没有权利期待我送你回堪萨斯，除非为我做事作为报答。在这个国家，每个人都要为自己得到的一切付出代价。如果你希望我用魔法送你回家，你就得先为我做事。你帮我，我就帮你。”

“我必须做什么？”小姑娘问。

“杀死邪恶的西方女巫。”奥兹回答。

“可我办不到！”多萝西大吃一惊，叫道。

“你杀死了东方女巫，穿着魔力强大的银鞋。现在世界上只剩一个邪恶女巫，等你可以告诉我她也死了的时候，我就送你回堪萨斯——这之前可不行。”

小姑娘开始哭起来，她失望极了；那双眼睛又眨了一下，焦急地看着她，仿佛大巫师奥兹觉得，只要多萝西愿意，她就能帮上他。

“我从来没有自愿地杀死过任何东西，”她抽泣道，“就算我想，我又怎么能杀死邪恶的西方女巫？如果您，伟大而可怕的奥兹，自己都不能杀死她，那怎么能指望我做到呢？”

“我不知道，”大脑袋说，“可这就是我的回答。等邪恶的西方女巫死去，你才能再见到你的叔叔和婶婶。记住，那女巫很邪恶——恶贯满盈——应该被杀死。现在，你走吧，完成任务之前不要再求见我。”

多萝西伤心地离开觐见室，回到狮子、稻草人和铁皮樵夫那里，他们等着听奥兹对她讲了什么。

“我没有希望了，”多萝西说，“因为要等我杀死邪恶的西方女巫，奥兹才会送我回家；而那是我永远都办不到的。”

她的朋友们都很难过，但又帮不上什么忙。于是，多萝西回到自己的房间，躺在床上哭泣，哭着哭着睡着了。

第二天早晨，绿胡子士兵来到稻草人的房间，说：

“跟我来，奥兹派我带你去见他。”

于是，稻草人跟着士兵走，获准进入了大觐见室。他看见翡翠宝座上坐着一位非常可爱的女士。她穿着绿绸薄纱裙，飘动的绿发上戴着一顶宝石皇冠，两肩上长着一对翅膀，色彩绚烂，轻盈得仿佛最轻微的气息都能拂动它们。

稻草人用他填充着稻草的身体，尽可能优雅地向面前这位美丽的女士鞠躬。女士温柔地望着稻草人，说：

“我是奥兹，伟大而可怕的奥兹。你是谁，为什么找我？”

这时，稻草人非常惊讶，他原以为会看到多萝西说的那个大脑袋；但他还是勇敢地回答：

“我只是一个稻草人，用稻草填充的。所以我没有脑子，我来恳求您给我脑袋里放些脑子，代替稻草，那样我就能和您国土上的其他人一样了。”

“我为什么要为你做这件事？”女士问。

“因为您是智慧而强大的奥兹，别人都帮不了我。”稻草人回答道。

“我从不不求回报地帮助人。”奥兹说，“但我许诺，如果你为我杀死邪恶的西方女巫，我就赐给你许多脑子，这些好使的脑子会让你成为全奥兹国最聪明的人。”

“我以为你曾让多萝西去杀死女巫。”稻草人吃惊地说。

“是的。我不在乎谁杀死女巫。但要等到她死了，我才会给你实现愿望。现在，你走吧，等你有资格获得你这么想要的脑子的时候，再来找我。”

稻草人伤心地回到朋友们那里，告诉了他们奥兹的话；多萝西吃惊地得知，大巫师奥兹不是她看到的大脑袋，而是一位可爱的女士。

“但是要求没变，”稻草人说，“她像铁皮樵夫一样需要一颗心。”

第二天早晨，绿胡子士兵来到铁皮樵夫的房间，说：

“奥兹派我带你去见他。跟我来。”

于是，铁皮樵夫跟着士兵走，来到大觐见室。他不知道自己见到的奥兹会是一位可爱的女士还是一个大脑袋，但他希望是那位可爱的女士。“因为，”铁皮樵夫心里想，“如果是大脑袋的话，我肯定得不到一颗心，因为脑袋自己没有心，不会同情我。但如果是那位可爱的女士，我就恳求她给我一颗心，因为所有的女人都自称心地善良。”

但是铁皮樵夫走进大觐见室时，他看到的既不是大脑袋，也不是女士。奥兹变身成一头十分可怕的野兽，个头跟大象差不多，绿色宝座似乎支撑不了它的重量。这野兽长着像犀牛一样的头，但脸上有五只眼睛，身上长出五条长胳膊，还有五条细长的腿，满身覆盖着厚羊毛一样的毛发。再也想象不出有什么野兽比它样子更可怕。幸亏铁皮樵夫那时还没有心，不然的话，它会因为恐惧而怦怦直跳。因为铁皮樵夫只是铁做的，所以他一点也不害怕，只是非常失望。

“我是奥兹，伟大而可怕的奥兹。”野兽大吼道，“你是谁，为什么找我？”

“我是一个樵夫，用铁皮做的。所以，我没有心，不能爱。我恳求您给我一颗心，那样我就能和其他人一样了。”

“我为什么要为你做这件事？”野兽问。

“因为我请求您，而且只有您能准许我的请求。”铁皮樵夫回答。

奥兹听了，发出一声低沉的吼叫，粗声说：

“你如果真想要一颗心，就得努力赢得它。”

“怎么赢得？”樵夫问。

“帮助多萝西杀死邪恶的西方女巫。”野兽回答，“等那女巫死了，你再来找我，那时我会给你一颗全奥兹国最大、最善良、最有爱的心。”

于是，铁皮樵夫只好伤心地回到朋友们那里，把自己看到的可怕野兽以及后来的事全告诉了他们。大家都对这位大巫师能变成各种样子惊奇不已。狮子说：

“如果我见到他是一头野兽，我就发出最响亮的吼声，吓住他，他就会答应我所有的请求。如果他是那位可爱的女士，我就装作要扑到她身上，逼她按照我的命令去做。如果他是那颗大脑袋，他就随我处置了；我会满屋滚动他，直到他答应给我们实现愿望。所以，高兴起来吧，我的朋友们，因为一切都会好起来。”

第二天早晨，绿胡子士兵领狮子去大觐见室，他吩咐狮子进去面见奥兹。

狮子立刻走进门，他环顾四周，惊讶地发现宝座前有一个大火球，火势凶猛，红光熊熊，让他难以注目。他首先想到的是，奥兹不小心着火烧起来了；但是当他想要靠近一些时，炽热的火焰烤焦了他的胡须，狮子颤抖着爬回靠近门边的一个地方。

这时，火球中传出一个低沉、平静的声音，它这样说道：

“我是奥兹，伟大而可怕的奥兹。你是谁，为什么找我？”狮子回答：

“我是胆小狮，什么都害怕。我来恳请您给我胆量，那样我就会真正成为名符其实的万兽之王。”

“我为什么该给你胆量？”奥兹问。

“因为在所有巫师中，您是最了不起的，只有您有能力完成我的请求。”狮子回答说。

火球熊熊燃烧了一会儿，那声音说道：

“把邪恶的西方女巫死去的证据带给我，那时我会给你胆量。只要那女巫还活着，你就得一直是个胆小鬼。”

狮子听到这话很愤怒，却无言以对，他站在那里，默默地凝视着火球。火焰越发炽烈，他只好转头冲出觐见室。狮子很高兴看到朋友们在等他，他把与巫师的可怕会面告诉了大家。

“我们现在该怎么办？”多萝西伤心地问。

“我们只能做一件事，”狮子回答说，“就是去温基国，找到邪恶的女巫，把她杀死。”

“要是我们办不到呢？”小姑娘说。

“那我就永远不会有胆量。”狮子表示。

“那我就永远不会有脑子。”稻草人补充说。

“那我就永远不会有一颗心。”铁皮樵夫说。

“而我就永远见不到艾姆婶婶和亨利叔叔了。”多萝西说着哭起来。

“小心！”绿姑娘叫道，“泪珠会落到你的绿丝裙上，留下斑点。”

听到这话，多萝西擦干眼泪，说：

“我想我们必须试一试；但我确定自己不想杀死任何人，哪怕是为了再见到艾姆婶婶。”

“我和你一起去。但是我太胆小，不敢杀死女巫。”狮子说。

“我也去。”稻草人表示，“但我这么笨，帮不上你什么忙。”

“哪怕是一个女巫，我也不忍心伤害，”铁皮樵夫说，“但如果你去，我也要跟你走。”

就这样，大家商定第二天早晨出发上路。于是，铁皮樵夫在一块绿色磨刀石上磨快了斧头，并给自己的所有关节上足了油。稻草人给自己填充了新鲜稻草，多萝西用油漆给他重新描画眼睛，这样他可以看得更清楚。绿姑娘对大家很好，她给多萝西的篮子装满好吃的，又用绿丝带把一只小铃铛系在托托脖子上。

大家早早上床，一直熟睡到天亮。是宫殿后院里一只绿公鸡的报晓啼鸣，还有一只生了绿蛋的母鸡的咯咯叫声唤醒了他们。





第十二章　寻找坏女巫


绿胡子士兵领着大家穿过翡翠城的街道，一直来到守门人住的房间。守门人为大家解下眼镜，放回他的大箱子，随后他礼貌地为我们的朋友打开大门。

“哪条路通往邪恶的西方女巫那里？”多萝西问。

“没有路，”守门人回答说，“从来没有人想要去那儿。”

“那我们怎么才能找到她？”小姑娘问。

“很简单，”守门人答道，“她一旦知道你们到了温基国，就会找上你们，让你们全给她做奴隶。”

“也许不会，”稻草人说，“因为我们想要杀死她。”

“噢，那是不一样。”守门人说，“以前从没有人杀死她，所以我很自然地以为她会把你们也变成奴隶，就像对别人一样。不过你们要小心，她邪恶凶暴，也许不会让你们杀死她。一直朝西方，就是太阳落山的方向走，你们一定能找到她。”

他们感谢了守门人，与他道别，然后朝西方出发，走上长满柔软青草、处处点缀着雏菊和金凤花的田野。多萝西还穿着在宫殿里穿上的漂亮丝绸衣裙，可是现在，她惊奇地发现，裙子不再是绿色的，竟变成了纯白色。再看托托脖子上的丝带，也褪去绿色，像多萝西的裙子一样白了。

很快，翡翠城就被远远留在身后。他们越往前走，地面越崎岖多山，因为这片西方的国度里没有农田和房屋，土地也没有开垦过。

下午的时候，太阳火辣辣地照着他们的脸，因为这地方没有树木遮阴。于是，天没黑，多萝西、托托和狮子就累了，他们躺倒在草地上睡着了，铁皮樵夫和稻草人为他们放哨。

邪恶的西方女巫只有一只眼睛，但它却像望远镜一样厉害，能看到每一个地方。此时，坏女巫坐在自己的城堡门口四处张望，碰巧看见多萝西睡着了，她的朋友们围在她身边。这几个旅行者离城堡还有很长一段路，但坏女巫看见他们来到自己的国家，就非常生气，于是她吹响了挂在脖子上的银哨。

哨声一响，立刻有一群大狼从四面八方向女巫跑来。它们长着长腿、凶恶的眼睛和锋利的牙齿。

“到那些人那里去，”女巫说，“把他们撕碎。”

“您不要他们给您做奴隶了？”狼群头领问。

“不要了，”女巫说，“一个是铁皮做的，一个是稻草做的，再加上一个小丫头，还有一头狮子。没有哪个适合干活，所以你们去把他们撕碎吧。”

“好。”那匹狼说完，全速飞奔而去，其他的狼也跟着他跑开了。

幸好，稻草人和铁皮樵夫十分清醒，听到狼群来了。

“我来应战，”樵夫说，“大家都到我身后，等它们来了，让我来对付它们。”

他抓起磨得十分锋利的斧头，等狼群头领扑上来时，他挥动胳膊，砍掉了狼头，那狼立刻就死了。樵夫刚能举起斧头，又一匹狼扑上来，它也倒在铁皮樵夫锋利的斧头下。每次一匹，樵夫一共砍死了四十匹狼。最后它们都堆积在樵夫面前。

之后，樵夫放下斧头，坐到稻草人身边。稻草人说：

“干得漂亮，朋友。”

他俩一直等到第二天早晨多萝西醒来。小姑娘看到一大堆毛烘烘的死狼，吓坏了。铁皮樵夫就把昨晚的事情都告诉了她。多萝西听完，感谢樵夫救了他们。等她吃完早餐，大家又开始赶路了。

还是这天早晨，女巫来到城堡门口，用她那只看得很远的眼睛朝外张望。她看见她的狼全死了，而那几个外乡人还在自己的国家旅行。这让她火气更大了，她第二次吹响银哨。

听到哨音，一大群野乌鸦立即朝女巫飞来，遮蔽了天空。坏女巫对鸦王说：

“马上飞到那些外乡人那里，啄出他们的眼睛，把他们撕成碎片。”

于是，这一大群野乌鸦向多萝西和她的伙伴们飞去。小姑娘看到乌鸦飞来，非常害怕。这时，稻草人说：

“我来对付它们，你们躺在我身边，就不会受伤。”

于是，大家都躺在地上，只有稻草人站立着，伸直胳膊。乌鸦一看到他，都害怕了，不敢再靠近，因为它们之前总是受到稻草人惊吓。然而，鸦王说：

“他只是个稻草人。我要把他的眼珠啄出来。”

鸦王说完，冲稻草人飞来，却被稻草人一把抓住头扭断脖子，死了。又一只乌鸦飞来，也被稻草人扭断了脖子。一只接着一只，稻草人一共扭断了四十只乌鸦的脖子。最后它们都死在稻草人脚边。这之后，稻草人才叫伙伴们起身。大家又继续赶路。

坏女巫又往外看去，只见她的乌鸦全倒成一片，她勃然大怒，第三次吹响银哨。

哨声一响，空中立刻传来一大片嗡嗡声，一群黑蜂朝女巫飞来。

“到那些外乡人那里去，蜇死他们！”女巫命令道。黑蜂们听了转身疾飞，一直来到在赶路的多萝西和她的朋友们周围。幸好樵夫已经看到黑蜂飞来了，而稻草人也决定了要怎么行动。

“把我的稻草掏出来，撒在小姑娘、狗和狮子身上，”稻草人对樵夫说，“那样黑蜂就蜇不着他们了。”樵夫照他的话做了。多萝西紧挨着狮子躺下，怀里抱着托托，稻草把他们完全盖住了。

黑蜂飞来了，它们发现除了樵夫，谁也蜇不着，就都飞向樵夫，结果全在铁皮上折断了毒刺，却丝毫没有伤到樵夫。黑蜂折断毒刺后就活不了，所以它们全都死了，密密麻麻地落在樵夫周围，像是一小堆一小堆的煤屑。

这时，多萝西和狮子站起来，小姑娘帮着铁皮樵夫把稻草塞回稻草人身体里，让他恢复原样。随后，大家又动身上路。

坏女巫看到她的黑蜂都死了，一小堆一小堆像煤屑一样，气得又是跺脚，又是扯头发，又是咬牙切齿。于是，她叫来十二个温基人奴隶，给他们锋利的长矛，让他们去杀死那几个外乡人。

温基人不是一个勇敢的民族，但他们不得不听从女巫的命令。于是，他们动身出发，一直走到多萝西附近。这时，狮子大吼一声，扑向他们。可怜的温基人吓得撒腿往回飞跑。

他们回到城堡后，坏女巫用皮带狠狠地抽打他们，又派他们回去干活。这之后，女巫坐下来为下一步做打算。她不明白为什么消灭这些外乡人的计划都失败了；但她是一个法力强大的女巫，而且心地邪恶，不一会儿就想好了该怎么办。

女巫的橱柜里有一顶金冠，上面镶嵌着一圈钻石和红宝石。这顶金冠有一种魔力。无论谁拥有它，都可以召唤三次飞猴，无论发出什么命令，飞猴都会听从。但没有人能控制这些奇怪的动物超过三次。坏女巫已经用了两次金冠的魔力。第一次，她使温基人做了她的奴隶，让自己统治了温基国。飞猴在这件事上帮助了她。第二次，她与伟大的奥兹本人交战，把他赶出了西方的国土。飞猴在这件事上也帮助了她。女巫只能再用一次金冠，正因为这个原因，她直到自己的所有其他魔力都用完了，才愿用这个办法。现在，她的恶狼、野乌鸦、蜇人的黑蜂都死了，她的奴隶也被胆小狮吓跑了，女巫意识到只剩下一个办法能消灭多萝西和她的朋友们。

于是，坏女巫从橱柜里取出金冠，戴在头上。

接着，她左脚独立，慢慢念道：

“艾—普，派—普，卡—克！”

然后，她又右脚独立，念道：

“西—罗，霍—罗，哈—罗！”

这之后，她两脚站立，大喊道：

“兹—兹，祖—兹，兹克！”

魔力开始发动。天色暗下来，空中传来低沉的隆隆声。接着，传来许多翅膀扑扇的声音，还有响亮的嘶叫声和笑声。随后，太阳钻出昏暗的天空，照亮了被一群猴子围绕着的坏女巫，这些猴子每只的肩上都长着一对巨大、有力的翅膀。

有一只飞猴比其他飞猴大许多，像是他们的头领。他飞近女巫，说：

“您已经是第三次，也是最后一次召唤我们了。您有什么吩咐？”

“到那几个我国土上的外乡人那里去，把他们全部消灭，只留下狮子，”女巫说，“再把那头野兽带到我这里，我要像驾驭马一样将他驯服，让他干活。”

“遵命。”飞猴头领说。随后，就听到一大片嘶叫声和吵闹声，飞猴们飞向正在赶路的多萝西和她的朋友们。

一些飞猴抓住铁皮樵夫，拽着他飞上天空，一直飞到一片布满尖利岩石的原野上空。他们把可怜的樵夫从这里扔下去。樵夫从高空坠落，狠狠地摔在岩石上，摔得浑身坑坑洼洼，躺在那里，动不了身，也哼不出声。

还有一些飞猴抓住了稻草人，用他们的长手指拽出他身子和脑袋里的所有稻草，把他的帽子、靴子和衣服捆成一小团，扔上一棵大树的树顶。

其余的飞猴用几根结实的绳子缠住狮子，绕着他的身子、脑袋和腿绑了一道又一道，直到狮子怎么也咬不着、抓不到、挣扎不得时才住手。之后，他们抬着狮子飞向女巫的城堡，把狮子放进一个围着高高的铁栅栏的小院子，免得他逃跑。

可是，飞猴们一点也没伤害多萝西。小姑娘怀抱托托站在那里，看着伙伴们一个个惨遭厄运，心想马上就轮到自己了。飞猴头领飞向多萝西，他伸出毛烘烘的长臂，丑陋的脸上露出可怕的笑容。正在这时，他看到多萝西额上有好女巫的吻痕，猛然停住了，并示意其他飞猴不要碰多萝西。

“我们不敢伤害这个小姑娘，”头领对飞猴们说，“因为她受到善力的保护，它比恶力更强大。我们能做的就是，送她到坏女巫的城堡，把她留在那里。”

于是，他们小心翼翼地轻轻托起多萝西，带着她急速飞往城堡，然后把她放在前门台阶上。飞猴头领对女巫说：

“我们已经尽力遵循您的吩咐。铁皮樵夫和稻草人都毁掉了，狮子绑在了您的院子里。我们不敢伤害这个小姑娘，还有她怀里抱着的小狗。您对我们猴群的魔力已经用完，再也不会见到我们了。”

他说完这话，所有飞猴吵着嚷着笑着，飞上天空，一会儿便远去不见了。

坏女巫看到多萝西额头上的印记，又吃惊又担忧，她心里清楚不论是飞猴还是她自己，都不敢动这小姑娘一根指头。她又低头看多萝西的脚，看到那双银鞋，她吓得发抖，因为这银鞋的巨大魔力她知道。女巫起初想逃跑；这时她凑巧望见了多萝西的眼睛：这眼睛背后的心灵是多么单纯！小姑娘不会知道银鞋能给她多么神奇的魔力。想到这里，女巫径自笑了：“我还是可以奴役她，因为她并不知道怎样使用她的魔力。”于是，她凶巴巴地对多萝西说：

“跟我来；你一定要把我说的每句话放在心上，不然我就结果了你，让你的下场与铁皮樵夫和稻草人一样。”

多萝西跟着女巫穿过城堡里许多漂亮的房间，一直来到厨房，女巫让她在这里刷锅洗碗、扫地添柴。

多萝西乖乖地去干活，决心不遗余力，因为她很高兴邪恶女巫决定留她一命。

女巫看到多萝西卖力地干活后，就想到院子里去，像骑马一样驾驭胆小狮；女巫相信，以后无论到哪里去，都让狮子拉车，自己肯定非常开心。可是，她刚一开门，胆小狮就一声大吼，朝她猛扑过来，女巫吓得奔出院子，重又关上院门。

“我驾驭不了你，”女巫隔着院门栏杆冲狮子说，“也能饿着你。等到你听我的话，我才给你饭吃。”

从那以后，她什么也不给被囚禁的狮子吃，却每天中午都到门口，朝里面问：

“你愿意像马一样拉车吗？”

狮子总是回答：

“不。要是你走进院子，我就咬你。”

狮子之所以不用照着女巫的要求做，是因为每天夜里，等到女巫睡着了，多萝西就从橱柜里拿食物给狮子吃。狮子吃完，卧在稻草垫子上，多萝西躺在狮子身旁，头枕着他柔软蓬乱的鬃毛，他俩谈论自己身处的困境，盘算着要逃出去。可是，他们想不出怎样才能逃出城堡，因为这里时时刻刻都有黄色的温基人守卫，他们是坏女巫的奴隶，不敢不按她的意思办事。

小姑娘白天得卖力干活，女巫经常威胁说要用手里一直拿着的旧雨伞揍她。但其实女巫并不敢打多萝西，因为她额头上有印记。小姑娘却不知道这一点，她为自己和托托满心担忧。有一次，女巫用雨伞打了托托一下，这只勇敢的小狗做出反击，冲上去咬了女巫的腿。女巫竟没有流血，原来她太邪恶了，身上的血好多年前就已经枯干了。

多萝西渐渐明白，想要回到堪萨斯，回到艾姆婶婶身边，比以前更难了，因此她的日子变得很难过。有时候，她一连几个小时地痛哭，这时托托蹲在她脚边，望着她的脸，悲伤地呜呜叫，倾诉它为小主人感到多么难过。实际上，托托不在乎它是在堪萨斯还是在奥兹国，只要有多萝西陪伴就行；可它明白小姑娘不开心，因此它也开心不了。

现在，坏女巫非常渴望拥有多萝西脚上穿的银鞋。她的黑蜂、乌鸦和狼成了一堆堆正在风干的死尸，她也用尽了金冠的魔力；可要是能把银鞋搞到手，她就能得到巨大的魔力，比之前失去的所有魔力加起来还大。女巫紧紧盯着多萝西，看她会不会脱下银鞋，想找机会偷走鞋子。可是小姑娘太为漂亮的银鞋感到自豪了，除了夜里和洗澡时，她无时无刻不穿着银鞋。女巫特别害怕黑暗，不敢在夜里走进多萝西的房间偷鞋，至于水，她就更害怕了，因此多萝西洗澡的时候，她从不靠近。实际上，这个老女巫从不碰水，也从不让一星半点的水碰到自己。

但是，坏女巫很狡猾，她终于想到一条诡计，可以搞到自己渴望的东西。她在厨房的地板中央放了一根铁棍，然后施展魔法，让人眼睛看不到它。于是，多萝西走过地板时，由于看不到铁棍，被绊倒在地。她摔得并不重，但一只银鞋却掉落了；女巫不等她伸手够着鞋子，便一把抢去，套在了自己瘦骨嶙峋的脚上。

这坏心眼的女人诡计得逞，高兴极了。只要她有了一只银鞋，就拥有一半银鞋的魔力，多萝西就算知道怎么施展魔法，也对付不了她。

小姑娘见自己丢了一只漂亮的鞋子，生气地冲女巫说：

“把鞋还给我！”

“不给，”女巫反驳道，“它现在是我的鞋了，不是你的鞋。”

“你这个坏蛋！”多萝西大声说，“你没权拿走我的鞋。”

“我要留下这只鞋，随你怎么说，”女巫嘲弄地说，“总有一天，我会把另外一只也搞到手。”

这话激怒了多萝西，她提起身旁的一桶水，泼向女巫，把她从头到脚浇了个透。

立刻，女巫发出一声恐惧的大叫，多萝西惊讶地朝她望去，只见女巫开始收缩、变小。

“看你干的好事！”女巫尖叫着，“我马上就要融化了。”

“真是对不起。”多萝西看到女巫竟然像红糖一样在她眼前融化，她真的害怕了。

“你不知道水会要我的命吗？”女巫绝望地哭号。

“当然不知道，”多萝西回答，“我怎么能知道？”

“哎，一会儿我就会全化掉，城堡是你的了。我做了一辈子坏事，从没想到你这么一个小丫头能融化我，结束我的恶行。看呐——我走了！”

话音刚落，女巫倒在地上，化成一摊难看的棕色浆液，在厨房的干净地板上漫流。多萝西看到女巫真的融化不见了，就又提起一桶水，浇在那摊浆液上，再把它全部扫出门。随后，多萝西捡起那老巫婆身上仅剩的银鞋，用布擦干净，重新穿到自己脚上。多萝西终于自由了，她跑出厨房，来到院子里，告诉狮子：邪恶的西方女巫已经死了，他们不再是异乡的囚犯了。





第十三章　营救


听说坏女巫已经被一桶水融化了，胆小狮非常高兴。多萝西立刻打开牢门，放他出来。他俩一同走进城堡，多萝西做的第一件事就是召集所有温基人，告诉大家他们不再是奴隶了。

黄色的温基人欢呼雀跃，因为许多年来他们被迫为坏女巫辛苦做工，而她对待他们总是非常残忍。从那以后，他们一直把这一天当作节日，宴饮跳舞来庆祝。

“要是我们的朋友稻草人和铁皮樵夫和我们在一起，”狮子说，“我该多高兴。”

“你不觉得我们可以救他们吗？”小姑娘焦急地问。

“我们可以试试。”狮子回答。

因此，他们叫来黄色的温基人，问温基人愿意不愿意帮忙援救他们的朋友。温基人说他们乐意为多萝西竭尽全力，是她解放了他们。于是，多萝西挑选了一些看上去最有见识的温基人，大家一起上路了。他们走了一天多，终于来到那片布满岩石的原野，铁皮樵夫躺在那里，浑身坑坑洼洼。斧头落在他近旁，可斧刃生了锈，斧柄摔断了。

温基人轻柔地抱起樵夫，把他抬回黄色城堡，一路上，多萝西看到老朋友的可怜样子，洒下了眼泪，狮子脸色阴沉悲伤。等他们到达城堡，多萝西对温基人说：

“你们之中有铁匠吗？”

“噢，有。我们有几位很优秀的铁匠。”温基人回答。

“请把他们领到我这里来。”多萝西说。后来，铁匠们提着装满各种工具的篮子来了，多萝西问道：

“你们能敲平铁皮樵夫身上的凹坑，把他扳回原状，并补好摔破的地方吗？”

铁匠们仔细查看樵夫之后，回答说他们相信自己能把樵夫修复如初。于是，他们在城堡的一个黄色大房间里开始工作，一连干了三天四夜，把铁皮樵夫的腿脚、身子和脑袋敲敲打打、拧来拧去、修修补补、打磨擦净，终于修理完毕，樵夫恢复了原状，关节也像从前一样灵活自如。当然，樵夫身上还是多了几个补丁，但铁匠们补得很棒，而且樵夫不是虚荣的人，丝毫不在意这些补丁。

最后，樵夫走进多萝西的房间，感谢她救活了自己，他高兴得直流眼泪。多萝西用围裙仔细地为他擦去泪水，免得他的关节生锈。这时，多萝西自己却因为再次见到老朋友高兴得泪如雨下，而这些眼泪用不着擦去。再看狮子，他不住地用尾巴尖擦眼睛，尾巴尖都湿透了，他不得不走到外面院子里，在太阳下晒干尾巴。

“要是稻草人还和我们在一起，”铁皮樵夫听多萝西讲完发生的一切，说道，“我该多高兴。”

“我们必须想办法找到他。”小姑娘说。

说完，她叫温基人来帮忙。他们走了一天多，终于来到大树下，稻草人的衣服就是被飞猴扔上了这棵树的树顶。

这是一棵非常高的树，树干光溜溜，谁也爬不上去；这时，樵夫马上开口说：

“我来砍倒它，那样我们就能拿到稻草人的衣服。”

原来在铁匠们修补樵夫的时候，有一个温基人是个金匠，他用纯金打造了一根斧柄，装在樵夫的斧头上，换下了那根摔坏的斧柄。其他人则把斧刃打磨得一点锈渍都没有，像擦亮的银器一样闪闪发光。

铁皮樵夫说砍就砍，不一会儿大树就轰然倒下，稻草人的衣服从树枝上落下，掉在地上。

多萝西捡起那些衣服，让温基人带回城堡，塞满干净的上好稻草。看呐！稻草人又完好如初了，他一遍又一遍地感谢大家救了他。

就这样，多萝西和朋友们又团聚了，他们在黄色城堡度过了几天快乐日子，舒服生活所需要的一切，城堡里都有。可是有一天，小姑娘想起了艾姆婶婶，她说：

“我们得回奥兹城去，请奥兹履行诺言。”

“对，”樵夫说，“我终于要有一颗心了。”

“那我要有脑子了。”稻草人高兴地补充。

“那我要有胆量了。”狮子若有所思地说。

“那我要回到堪萨斯了。”多萝西拍着手叫道，“噢，我们明天就出发去翡翠城吧！”

他们决定就这么办。第二天，他们把温基人叫到一处，与温基人道别。温基人舍不得让这些伙伴离开，他们喜欢上了铁皮樵夫，请求他留下来，统治他们和黄色的西方国土。在得知伙伴们一定要走之后，温基人送给托托和狮子各一个金项圈，送给多萝西一只镶嵌钻石的漂亮手镯，送给稻草人一根金头手杖，免得他跌倒，还送给铁皮樵夫一只镶金嵌宝的银油壶。

每位旅行者都向温基人美言一番，表示感谢，又都与温基人握手告别，胳膊都摇疼了。

多萝西到女巫的橱柜里找食物，好装进篮子带在路上吃。在那里，她看见了金冠。她试着把它戴在自己头上，发现大小正合适。她对金冠的魔力一点都不知道，只是见它很漂亮，就决定戴着金冠，把太阳帽放进篮子。

大家都为旅行做好了准备，随后就朝翡翠城进发了；温基人向他们欢呼三声，说了许多祝福的话。





第十四章　飞猴


你应该还记得，在坏女巫的城堡和翡翠城之间没有路，连一条小道也没有。四位旅行者寻找坏女巫时，是女巫发现了他们，派飞猴把他们送到自己面前。这次没有人送，他们要穿过金凤花和黄色雏菊的广阔原野，回翡翠城去，就难得多了。当然，他们知道应该往东，往日出的方向直走；于是，他们朝着这个正确的方向动身了。可到了中午，太阳升到头顶，他们就不知道哪边是东哪边是西了，因此他们在茫茫原野中迷了路。然而，他们还是继续赶路，夜里，月亮升起来，洒下皎皎光明。于是，除了稻草人和铁皮樵夫，大家躺倒在芳香的黄色花丛中，熟睡到天亮。

第二天早晨，太阳躲在云后，可大家仍旧起身上路，好像十分确定该往哪个方向走。

“如果走得够快，”多萝西说，“我们肯定会在某个时候到达某个地方。”

可日复一日，他们眼前还是只有开满金凤花的黄色原野。稻草人开始发小牢骚。

“我们肯定迷了路，”他说，“要是不能及时找到去奥兹城的路，我就永远都不会得到脑子了。”

“那我就得不到心了，”铁皮樵夫大声说，“我觉得自己等不及到奥兹国，你们得承认，这段路确实很漫长。”

“你们看，”胆小狮抽泣道，“这根本没有终点，我没有胆量一直这么走下去。”

听大家这么一说，多萝西也灰心了。她坐在草地上望着伙伴们，而他们也坐在那里望着她；托托觉得这辈子头一次，它没有力气再去追逐飞过头顶的蝴蝶。它伸出舌头，直喘气，也望着多萝西，好像在问下一步大家该怎么办。

“如果叫来田鼠，”多萝西提议，“他们也许能告诉我们怎么去翡翠城。”

“他们当然能，”稻草人叫起来，“我们之前怎么没想到这个主意？”

多萝西吹响小哨子，自从田鼠女王送给她这只哨子，她就一直戴在脖子上。不一会儿，大家听到一阵细微的脚步声，一大群灰色的小田鼠朝多萝西跑来。女王自己也一同来了，她用尖细的声音问：

“我能帮上朋友们的忙吗？”

“我们迷路了，”多萝西说道，“你能告诉我们怎么去翡翠城吗？”

“当然了，”女王回答，“但翡翠城很远，因为你们一直都在往反方向走。”这时，她看见了多萝西的金冠，“你为什么不用金冠的魔力召集飞猴来帮助你们？用不了一个小时，他们就能送你们到奥兹城。”

“我不知道金冠有魔力。”多萝西很吃惊，“咒语是什么？”

“咒语写在金冠里面，”田鼠女王回答，“但是，如果你要召集飞猴，我们就得跑开了，因为他们爱搞恶作剧，以捉弄我们为乐。”

“他们不会伤害我吗？”小姑娘担心地问。

“噢，不会的。他们必须服从金冠的主人。再见！”说完，她急匆匆跑走，不见了踪影，别的田鼠也跟着她跑了。

多萝西查看金冠的里面，发现内衬上有字。她想这些一定就是咒语，于是她仔细读完说明，把金冠戴在头上。

“艾—普，派—普，卡—克！”她左脚独立，念道。

“你说什么？”稻草人不明白多萝西在做什么。

“西—罗，霍—罗，哈—罗！”多萝西又右脚独立，继续念道。

“哈罗！”铁皮樵夫平静地答道。

“兹—兹，祖—兹，兹克！”多萝西两脚站立，念道。咒语念完之后，大家听到巨大的翅膀扑扇声，还有笑闹的声音，就见那群猴子飞来了。猴王向多萝西深鞠一躬，问道：

“您有什么吩咐？”

“我们想去翡翠城，”小姑娘说，“可我们迷路了。”

“我们送你们去。”猴王答道。话音刚落，两只飞猴就抱起多萝西，带着她飞走了。别的飞猴带起稻草人、樵夫和狮子，一只小飞猴不顾托托竭力想咬他，抱着托托跟在后面。

一开始，稻草人和铁皮樵夫很害怕，因为他们还记得飞猴以前对待他们有多凶狠；可现在他们看到飞猴没有恶意，就高高兴兴地在高空飞行，欣赏地上美丽的花园和树林。

多萝西坐在两只飞猴中间轻松地飞行。这两只飞猴个头最大，其中一只就是猴王，他们用手臂搭成椅子，小心翼翼地不让多萝西受伤。

“你们为什么要服从金冠的魔力？”小姑娘问。

“说来话长，”猴王笑道，“不过我们的旅途也很漫长，要是你想听，我就讲讲其中的缘由，来打发时间。”

“我很愿意听。”多萝西答道。

“从前，”猴王打开了话匣子，“我们自由自在地生活在大森林里，从一棵树上飞到另一棵树上，吃坚果和水果，高兴做什么就做什么，不用听任何人的吩咐。也许我们有些飞猴有时太爱搞恶作剧了，他们从大树上飞下来拉扯没有翅膀的动物的尾巴，追逐鸟儿，还朝路过森林的人扔坚果。可那时，我们真是无忧无虑、开心有乐子，每时每刻都快活得很。这是很多年以前的事了，那时奥兹还没有从云上降下来统治这片土地。

“那时北方住着一位美丽的公主，她也是一位法力强大的魔法师。她把自己所有的魔法都用来帮助他人，从没听说她伤害过哪个好人。公主名叫加叶莱特，她住在用大块的红宝石砖建造的美丽宫殿中。人人都爱她，但她最苦恼的是找不到一个人来付出她的爱，因为所有男子都太蠢太丑，配不上如此美丽智慧的加叶莱特。最后，她终于找到一位合意的少年，他英俊、健美、智慧，远比同龄男子出色。加叶莱特打定主意，等少年长大成人，就嫁给他。于是，她把少年带去红宝石宫殿，倾尽魔力把他培养成所有女人都会爱慕的强健、善良又秀美的男子。少年名叫奎拉拉，后来据说他长成了世上最优秀、最智慧的男子，俊美非凡，加叶莱特深深爱着他，迫不及待地为婚礼做好了一切准备。

“我爷爷那时是猴王，他们住在加叶莱特宫殿附近的森林里。老人家特别喜欢开玩笑，为了一个玩笑宁可不吃一顿美餐。有一天，那是婚礼前夕，爷爷带着猴群飞出森林，正巧看到奎拉拉在河边散步。见奎拉拉身穿粉色绸缎和紫色天鹅绒裁成的华美衣服，爷爷想要捉弄他一番。爷爷一声令下，猴群飞下来，抓住奎拉拉，抱着他一直飞到河中央的上空，把他扔到了河里。

“‘游上来，好小伙子，’爷爷叫道，‘看看衣服有没有泡花！’奎拉拉聪明得很，当然会游泳，他一点都没被好运气宠坏。他冒出水面，大笑着游上岸。加叶莱特赶来，却看见奎拉拉的丝绸和天鹅绒衣服全被河水泡坏了。

“公主很恼火，她当然知道这是谁干的。于是，她让人叫来所有飞猴，先是说要绑上飞猴们的翅膀，就像他们对待奎拉拉那样，也把他们扔到河里。爷爷知道飞猴们被绑住翅膀扔到河里，一定会淹死，他苦苦恳求公主，再加上奎拉拉也为他们求情，最后公主饶过了他们，但她提出一个条件：从那以后飞猴要服从金冠主人的三次吩咐。金冠是作为送给奎拉拉的结婚礼物打造的，据说花去了举国财富的一半。自然，爷爷和其他飞猴立刻同意了那个条件，这就是为什么我们要给金冠的主人做三次奴隶，不管这主人是谁。”

“他们后来怎样了？”多萝西问，她对这个故事很有兴趣。

“奎拉拉成了这顶金冠的第一位主人，”猴王答道，“他是第一个吩咐我们的人。因为他的新娘受不了看见我们，所以他们结婚后，他就到森林里把我们都叫到他跟前，吩咐我们永远待在公主再也看不见一只飞猴的地方。我们很乐意这么做，因为我们都怕她。

“金冠落入邪恶的西方女巫手里之前，我们要做的就只有这些。那坏女巫让我们奴役温基人，后来又把奥兹本人赶出了西方的国度。如今金冠属于你了，你有权让我们听你三次吩咐。”

猴王的故事讲完了，多萝西从天空中往下看，只见翡翠城闪闪发光的绿色城墙出现在前方。小姑娘感到惊讶，猴子们竟然飞得这么快，但她很高兴旅行终于结束了。这些怪家伙小心翼翼地把旅行者们放在城门口，猴王向多萝西深鞠一躬，就带着猴群迅速地飞走了。

“这是一次美妙的空中旅行。”小姑娘说。

“是呀，还是摆脱麻烦的快捷方法。”狮子答道，“幸好你拿走了那顶奇妙的金冠！”





第十五章　发现可怕的奥兹的真面目


四位旅行者走到翡翠城的大门前，按响门铃。铃响了几声以后，他们从前见过的那位守门人打开了大门。

“怎么！你们又回来了？”他吃了一惊，问道。

“你看不见我们吗？”稻草人反问。

“可我以为你们去找邪恶的西方女巫了。”

“我们确实去找她了。”稻草人说。

“她又放了你们？”守门人惊讶地问。

“她没办法不放我们，因为她已经融化了。”稻草人解释道。

“融化了！噢，这可真是好消息。”守门人说，“是谁把她融化了？”

“是多萝西。”狮子郑重其事地说。

“太好了！”守门人高声说道，并朝多萝西深鞠一躬。

随后，守门人把他们领进自己的小屋，像上一次一样，他从大箱子里取出绿眼镜，帮大家戴上并锁好这之后，他们穿过大门，走进翡翠城。人们从守门人那儿听说多萝西把邪恶的西方女巫融化了，就都围住这几位旅行者。一大群人跟着他们往奥兹的宫殿去。

绿胡子士兵依然守在门前，但这次他立刻让大家进去了。美丽的绿姑娘再次接待他们，马上领他们到各人之前住过的房间休息，等伟大的奥兹准备好接见他们。

士兵直接禀告奥兹：多萝西和其他几位旅行者消灭坏女巫后，又回来了。可是奥兹没有回复。他们原以为大巫师奥兹会立刻召见他们，但是他没有。第二天，他们没有得到他的消息，第三天没有，第四天还是没有。他们等得无聊而疲倦，最后越来越恼火——奥兹让他们去经历困难和奴役后，竟然这样怠慢他们。于是，稻草人请绿姑娘再给奥兹捎个信，说如果奥兹不马上让他们进去拜见他，他们就召唤飞猴来帮忙，看看奥兹说话算不算数。奥兹得到这个消息，十分害怕，传话说隔天早晨九点四分在觐见室接见他们。奥兹在西方的土地上见识过飞猴，他不想再见到它们。

四位旅行者度过了一个无眠的夜晚，各人想着奥兹许诺送给自己的礼物。多萝西只睡着了一会儿，她梦见自己在堪萨斯，艾姆婶婶正对她说，真高兴自己的小姑娘又回家了。

第二天早晨九点，绿胡子士兵准时来到他们房间，四分钟后，他们都走进大巫师奥兹的觐见室。

很自然，每个人都以为要见到的奥兹是原来的样子，而当他们环顾四周，发现觐见室内空无一人时，都大吃一惊。他们紧靠房门，彼此紧紧挨在一起，因为空屋的寂静比他们之前看到的奥兹变换出的任何样子都吓人。

不一会儿，他们听到一个声音，好像是从靠近大圆顶中心的某个地方传来的。那个声音严肃地说道：

“我是奥兹，伟大而可怕的奥兹。你们为什么找我？”

大家又看看房间的每一个角落，还是没有看到任何人。多萝西就问：

“您在哪里？”

“我无处不在，”那声音说，“但凡人的眼看不到我。现在，我要坐上宝座，你们可以和我讲话。”这时，那声音好像真的正从宝座传来；于是，大家走到宝座前，站成一排。多萝西说：

“我们是来请您履行诺言的，奥兹。”

“什么诺言？”奥兹问。

“您许诺过，坏女巫死后，就送我回堪萨斯。”小姑娘说。

“您许诺过给我脑子。”稻草人说。

“您许诺过给我一颗心。”铁皮樵夫说。

“您许诺过给我胆量。”胆小狮说。

“坏女巫真的死了吗？”那声音问。多萝西觉得它有点发颤。

“是的，”她回答说，“我用一桶水把她融化了。”

“天啊，”那声音说，“太突然了！你们明天再来见我吧，因为我需要时间想一想。”

“你已经用了很多时间。”铁皮樵夫生气地说。

“我们不会再等一天了。”稻草人说。

“你得对我们说话算话！”多萝西喊叫着。

狮子觉得不妨吓唬一下巫师，于是发出一声洪亮的咆哮。这声音非常凶猛可怕，托托吓得惊慌地从狮子身边跳开。它一不小心踢翻了屋角的一面屏风。屏风哗啦一声倒在地上，大家都朝那边看，顿时惊呆了。因为他们看到屏风后面原来躲着一个小老头，他脑袋光秃，满脸皱纹，看起来跟大家一样惊讶。这时，铁皮樵夫举起斧头，朝小老头冲过去，他大声问：

“你是谁？”

“我是奥兹，伟大而可怕的奥兹。”小老头声音颤抖地说，“别打我——千万别打我！——你们要我做什么，我都照做。”

我们的朋友们吃惊又失望地看着他。

“我以为奥兹是一个大脑袋。”多萝西说。

“我以为奥兹是一位可爱的女士。”稻草人说。

“我以为奥兹是一头可怕的野兽。”铁皮樵夫说。

“我以为奥兹是一只火球。”狮子大声说。

“不，你们都错了。”小老头温和地说，“这些全是我装成的。”

“装成的！”多萝西喊道，“你不是一位伟大的巫师？”

“小声点，亲爱的，”他说，“别这么大声说话，让别人听见，我就完了。我装成大巫师。”

“你不是吗？”多萝西问。

“根本不是，亲爱的；我只是个普通人。”

“你连普通人都不如，”稻草人伤心地说，“你是个骗子。”

“一点也没错！”小老头搓着手说，好像听到这话很高兴，“我是个骗子。”

“可这很可怕，”铁皮樵夫说，“我究竟该怎么得到心呢？”

“我该怎么得到胆量呢？”狮子问。

“我该怎么得到脑子呢？”稻草人哭着说，用衣袖擦去眼中流出的泪水。

“我亲爱的朋友们，”奥兹说，“请你们不要提这些小事。想想我吧，我被揭穿了，要惹上大麻烦。”

“再没有人知道你是个骗子吗？”多萝西问。

“除了你们四个——和我自己，再没有人知道。”奥兹回答，“我愚弄了大家这么久，还以为永远不会被揭穿。让你们进入觐见室，是我犯的一个大错。平常，我连自己的臣民都不见，他们因此相信我非常可怕。”

“可是我不明白，”多萝西很困惑，“我看到的你是一个大脑袋，这是怎么回事？”

“这是我的一个把戏，”奥兹回答说，“请过来，我把这一切都告诉你们。”

小老头领路，大家跟着他来到觐见室后面的一个小房间。他指向房间的一角，那儿放着一颗大脑袋。这脑袋是用许多厚纸糊成的，脸画得十分精细。

“我用绳子把它挂在天花板上，”奥兹说，“然后，我站在屏风后拉一根线，控制眼睛的转动和嘴巴的张合。”

“可那声音是怎么回事？”多萝西问。

“我会口技，”小老头说，“我能让自己的声音从任何地方传出，所以你觉得声音是脑袋发出的。看，我还用这些东西骗你们。”

他接着向稻草人展示了他假扮可爱女士时穿的衣裙、戴的面具。铁皮樵夫看见凶恶的野兽只是一堆缝在一起、靠板条支撑的兽皮。而那火球也是假巫师吊在天花板上的，它其实是一团棉花，一浇上油就熊熊燃烧。

“真的，”稻草人说，“你应该为自己这样骗人感到羞愧。”

“是的，我确实感到羞愧，”小老头的语气充满悔恨，“可我只能这么办。大家请坐，这里有很多椅子。我给你们讲讲我的故事。”

于是，大家坐下，听他讲下面这个故事。

“我出生在奥马哈市——”

“噢，那儿离堪萨斯不远！”多萝西叫道。

“是的，但离这儿很远。”小老头伤心地摇摇头，“长大后，我做了口技艺人，还在一位口技大师那里受过良好训练。我能模仿任何鸟兽。”说到这儿，他学小猫喵喵叫了几声。托托竖起耳朵，四面张望，看小猫在哪里。“过了一段时间，”奥兹接着说，“我厌倦了口技，又当了一名气球驾驶员。”

“什么是气球驾驶员？”多萝西问。

“他在表演马戏的日子，乘气球上天，以此吸引人群，让人们掏钱看马戏。”他解释道。

“噢，”多萝西说，“我明白了。”

“有一天，我乘气球升空，绳子绞在了一起，我落不了地。就这样，气球一直升上高高的云端，被一股气流卷带着，飞了很远很远。我在空中飞了一天一夜，第二天早晨我醒来，发现气球飘在一座美丽的陌生国度上空。

“气球缓缓下落，我一点也没有受伤。但我发现自己在一群陌生人中，他们见我从云上来，以为我是一位大巫师。我当然默认了他们的想法，因为他们害怕我，并且许诺我让他们做什么，他们都照做。

“只是为了让我自己开心，让这些好人忙碌，我下令建造这座城市和我的宫殿；他们甘心乐意，并且做得很好。我想，这国度这么绿这么美，就叫它翡翠城吧。为了让它更名符其实，我给所有人戴上绿眼镜，这样他们看到的一切都是绿色的。”

“难道这里的一切不都是绿色的吗？”

“并不比其他城的更绿，”奥兹说，“不过你戴上绿眼镜后，看到的一切当然都是绿色的。翡翠城是多年前建造的。我被气球带来时还是一个小伙子，现在我已经很老了。我的人民戴绿眼镜太久了，于是大部分人以为这真是一座翡翠城，也自然是一个美丽的地方，盛产珠宝和贵金属，还有人让人们幸福所需的各样美好事物。我对人民很好，他们爱戴我。但自从这宫殿建成后，我就把自己关在里面，不见他们任何人。

“我最害怕的是那些女巫，因为我没有一点魔力，却很快发现她们确实能做奇妙的事。这国度里有四位女巫，分别统治住在东西南北四方的人民。幸运的是，北方和南方的女巫是好女巫，我知道她们不会伤害我；但东方和西方的女巫邪恶至极，如果她们认为我不比她们法力强，她们肯定会杀死我。就这样，有很多年我都怕极了她们；所以你想想，我听说你的房子掉在邪恶的东方女巫身上时多么高兴。你们到我这里来时，我什么都愿意答应，只要你们能除掉另一个坏女巫；可是，现在你已经把她融化了，而我却要羞愧地说，我履行不了自己的诺言。”

“我觉得你是个大坏蛋。”多萝西说。

“噢，不，亲爱的，我真的是一个好人，但我必须承认，我是一个糟糕的巫师。”

“您难道给不了我脑子吗？”稻草人问。

“你不需要脑子。你每天都在学习。婴儿有脑子，但知道的并不多。只有经验能带来知识，你在这世上生活得越久，得到的经验肯定就越多。”

“也许是那样的，”稻草人说，“但除非您给我脑子，否则我就开心不起来。”

假巫师仔细打量着稻草人。

“好吧，”他叹了口气说，“我说过，我不算是一个魔法师。但明天上午你来吧，我会往你脑袋里装些脑子的。可是，我不能告诉你怎么用这些脑子，你得自己领会。”

“噢，谢谢——谢谢您！”稻草人叫道，“不用担心，我会找到用脑子的方法！”

“那我的胆量呢？”狮子焦急地问。

“我相信你很有胆量，”奥兹回答，“你所需要的只是相信自己。没有什么生物遇到危险不害怕。真正的胆量是在感到害怕时能直面危险，而这样的胆量你有许多。”

“也许我有，但我还是一样害怕。”狮子说，“除非您给我那种让人忘记恐惧的胆量，不然，我真的会很不开心。”

“好的，我明天给你那种胆量。”奥兹回答道。

“那我的心呢？”铁皮樵夫问。

“哎呀，至于那个，”奥兹说，“我觉得你不该想要一颗心。心让许多人不幸福。你没有心是很幸运的，要是你明白这点就好了。”

“这事见仁见智。”铁皮樵夫说，“如果您给我一颗心，我愿意毫无怨言地承受它带来的一切苦恼。”

“好，”奥兹温和地说，“明天你来我这里，我给你一颗心。我扮了许多年巫师，不妨再扮一阵子。”

“那么，”多萝西说，“我怎么能回到堪萨斯？”

“这我们得想一想。”小老头回答说，“请给我两三天时间考虑这件事，我会想个办法把你送出沙漠。这期间，你们就是我的客人，你们住在这座宫殿里，我的人会服侍你们，哪怕是你们最微小的愿望，都会得到满足。我只求你们也帮我一个忙——不是什么大事。请你们保守秘密，不告诉任何人我是个骗子。”

大家答应不透露一点所见所闻，随后兴高采烈地回到自己的房间。就连多萝西也希望这个被她称为“伟大而可怕的骗子”的人能设法送她回堪萨斯。如果他真做到了，多萝西愿意原谅他之前的一切所作所为。





第十六章　大骗子的魔术


第二天早晨，稻草人对朋友们说：

“祝贺我吧。我终于要去奥兹那里得到脑子了。我回来时，就和其他人一样了。”

“我一直喜欢你本来的样子。”多萝西直白地说。

“谢谢你喜欢一个稻草人。”他回答道，“等你听到我的新脑子冒出的奇思妙想时，你肯定会对我刮目相看。”说完，他愉快地告别大家，来到觐见室门口，轻轻地敲敲门。

“请进。”奥兹应声说。

稻草人走进觐见室，看见小老头坐在窗边，陷入沉思。

“我是来要脑子的。”稻草人有点不安地说。

“噢，好的。请坐在那把椅子上，”奥兹说，“请你原谅，我不得不拆下你的脑袋，这样我才能把脑子放到合适的地方。”

“没关系，”稻草人说，“非常欢迎您拆下我的脑袋，只要您再把它缝上时，它能变得更好就行。”

于是，奥兹拆下稻草人的脑袋，掏空里面的稻草，然后到里屋取出一升掺了许多大头针和缝衣针的谷糠，摇晃一番让它们彻底混合，再把混合物倒进稻草人头顶，用稻草塞满空隙，让脑袋成型。奥兹把稻草人的脑袋重新缝在他的身子上，对他说：

“从今以后，你就是个了不起的人了，因为我给了你许多新糠脑子。”

稻草人实现了自己最大的愿望，又高兴又骄傲，他热情地感谢了奥兹，回到朋友们那里。

多萝西好奇地看着他。他的脑袋因为装了脑子，顶上鼓鼓囊囊的。

“你感觉怎么样？”多萝西问。

“我觉得自己确实聪明了，”稻草人真诚地说，“等我习惯了自己的脑子，我就会无所不知。”

“为什么这些大头针和缝衣针从你脑袋里突出来？”铁皮樵夫问。

“这证明他思想敏锐。”狮子说。

“噢，我必须到奥兹那里去得到我的心。”樵夫说完，走到觐见室门口，敲了敲门。

“请进。”奥兹答道。樵夫走进觐见室，说：

“我是来要心的。”

“好的，”小老头回答，“但我得在你胸口开一个洞，这样我才能把心放到合适的地方。我希望这不会弄疼你。”

“噢，不会的，”樵夫说，“我一点也感觉不到。”

于是，奥兹拿来一副铁匠的大剪刀，在铁皮樵夫的左胸口开了一个方形的小洞，又从五斗橱里拿出一颗漂亮的心。这颗心整个是用丝绸做的，里面填满锯末。

“漂亮吗？”他问。

“真漂亮！”樵夫十分满意地说，“这颗心善良吗？”

“噢，非常善良！”奥兹回答。他把那颗心放进樵夫的胸膛，然后把方形的小洞补好，焊牢切口。

“好了，”奥兹说，“现在你有一颗会让任何人都感到骄傲的心。很抱歉，我不得不在你的胸口打个补丁，我实在是没有办法。”

“没关系，”樵夫高兴地大声说，“非常感谢您，我会永远记得您的帮助。”

“不客气。”奥兹回答。

铁皮樵夫回到朋友那里。大家都因为他的好运而祝贺他。

这次，狮子走到觐见室门口，敲了敲门。

“请进。”奥兹应声说。

“我是来要胆量的。”狮子一边走进房间，一边宣布。

“好，”奥兹答道，“我拿给你。”

他走到橱柜边，伸手从高架上取下一只绿色方瓶，把里面的液体倒进一只雕工精美的绿金色碟子，端到胆小狮面前。狮子用鼻子嗅嗅，似乎不喜欢那味道。奥兹说：

“喝吧。”

“这是什么？”狮子问。

“噢，”奥兹说，“如果你把它喝下肚，它就变成胆量。你当然知道，胆量在身体里；所以，只有你喝下去以后，这东西才能叫作胆量。我劝你赶紧喝了它吧。”

狮子听完不再犹豫，喝干了碟子里的液体。

“现在你感觉怎么样？”奥兹问。

“浑身是胆。”狮子回答。他高高兴兴地回到朋友们那里，告诉他们自己多么幸运。

大家都离开后，奥兹想到他成功地给了稻草人、铁皮樵夫和狮子他们以为自己没有的东西，就笑了。“我怎么能不骗他们呢？”奥兹自言自语道，“他们几个让我办的事，人人都知道是办不到的。让稻草人、铁皮樵夫和狮子开心不难，因为他们把我想象得无所不能。可是要送多萝西回堪萨斯，光靠想象力可不够，我真不知道怎么才能办到。”





第十七章　气球升空


三天了，多萝西没有听到奥兹给她的任何消息。尽管朋友们都非常高兴又满足，但这些日子多萝西很伤心。稻草人告诉大家，他脑袋里充满奇思妙想，但没说这些想法是什么，因为他知道除了自己，没人能明白。铁皮樵夫感觉走路时，心在胸腔里怦怦跳动；他对多萝西说，他发现这颗心比他还是血肉之躯时的那颗心还要善良温柔。狮子声称，他在这个世界上什么也不怕，乐意直面一支军队或十几头凶猛的卡利达。

因此，除了多萝西，小伙伴们个个心满意足。而她越发渴望回到堪萨斯。

第四天，奥兹终于召见多萝西，小姑娘高兴极了。她走进觐见室，奥兹愉快地说：

“请坐，亲爱的。我想我找到了送你离开这个国度的办法。”

“回到堪萨斯吗？”多萝西急切地问。

“噢，不一定能到堪萨斯，”奥兹说，“因为我根本不知道它在哪个方向。但我们要做的第一件事是跨越沙漠，之后你就很容易找到回家的路了。”

“我怎么能跨越沙漠呢？”多萝西问。

“好，我来说说我的想法。”小老头说，“你看，我是乘气球来到这个国度的。你被旋风卷带着，也是从空中来。所以，我相信最好从空中跨越沙漠。要制造一场旋风，我完全办不到；但我仔细考虑了这件事，我自信能造一只气球。”

“那怎么造呢？”多萝西问。

“气球，”奥兹说，“用绸缎缝制，刷上胶，让里面的氢气漏不出来。我的宫殿里有许多绸缎，造一只气球没问题。不过，这个国度里没有氢气来充气球，好让它飘起来。”

“如果气球飘不起来，”多萝西说，“它对我们就没有用了。”

“对。”奥兹说，“但还有一种办法可以让它飘起来，就是给它充热气。热气比不上氢气，因为如果热气冷却下来，气球会落在沙漠里，我们就要迷路。”

“我们！”小姑娘叫道，“您要和我一起走吗？”

“是呀，当然。”奥兹回答说，“我厌倦了当这样的骗子。如果我走出宫殿，我的人民很快就会发现我不是一位巫师，他们会因为我欺骗了他们而恼怒。因此，我不得不整天关在这些房间里，这无聊得很。我宁愿跟你去堪萨斯，回到马戏团里。”

“我很高兴有您做伴。”多萝西说。

“谢谢。”奥兹说，“现在，如果你愿意帮我缝绸缎，我们就开始造气球。”

于是，多萝西拿起针线，奥兹把缎带裁成合适的形状，小姑娘飞快地把它们缝合整齐。先是淡绿色缎带，然后是深绿色缎带，接着是翡翠绿色缎带；奥兹想要气球由不同色调的绿缎带拼成。他们花了三天缝完所有的缎带，缝好了一只长二十多英尺的绿色大绸布袋。

接着，奥兹在里面刷上一层薄胶，使它不透气。之后，他宣布气球造好了。

“可我们还需要一只篮子来载我们。”奥兹说。于是，他派绿胡子士兵取来一只绿色的大洗衣篮，用许多根绳子系在气球底下。

这一切准备好后，奥兹向他的人民传话说，他要去拜访一位住在云端的大巫师兄弟。这个消息很快传遍了翡翠城，人们都来观看这场盛况。

奥兹下令将气球抬到宫殿前面，人们好奇地看着气球。铁皮樵夫已经劈好一大堆木柴，他生起火，奥兹把气球的底部举在火堆上，这样从火堆上腾起的热气就会被收集到绸布袋里。气球渐渐膨胀升空，直到篮子触到地面。

这时，奥兹走进篮子，大声对他的人民宣布：

“我要外出访问。在我离开的这段时间，稻草人将统治你们。我命令你们服从他，如同服从我一样。”

这时，气球拽紧了将它系在地面的绳子，因为内部充满热气，气球比外部的空气轻了许多，所以它把绳子扯得紧紧的往空中飞升。

“快来，多萝西！”巫师大喊道，“快点，否则气球就要飞走了。”

“我怎么也找不到托托了。”多萝西回答。她不想落下她的小狗。原来托托钻进了人群，去冲一只小喵吠叫。多萝西终于找到它，抱起它朝气球飞跑。

眼看多萝西离气球只差几步了，奥兹正伸着手要帮她跨进篮子。突然，咔嚓一声，绳子断了！气球一下子升上天空，多萝西被留在了地上。

“回来！”她尖叫着，“我也要走！”

“我回不去，亲爱的，”奥兹从篮子上冲下边喊，“再见！”

“再见！”人们都喊道。所有人都抬头望着乘篮子升空的奥兹，篮子越升越高，飞上天空。

这是人们最后一次见到神奇的巫师奥兹。也许他已经安全到达奥马哈市，并且现在还在那里。不过，人们深切地怀念他，对彼此说：

“奥兹一直是我们的朋友。他在的时候为我们建造了这座美丽的翡翠城，如今他走了，又留下智慧的稻草人统治我们。”

可是，人们还是为失去这位神奇的巫师伤心了很多日子，心情难以平静。





第十八章　到南方去


多萝西回堪萨斯的希望破灭了，她伤心痛哭。但她细想一番后，又为自己没有乘气球飞去而高兴。同时，她为失去奥兹感到惋惜，她的伙伴们也感到惋惜。

铁皮樵夫对她说：

“奥兹给了我一颗可爱的心，如果我不为失去他难过，那我真是忘恩负义。他走了，我多想哭一会儿。你愿意好心地帮我擦去眼泪，免得我生锈吗？”

“当然愿意。”多萝西说完，立刻拿来一条毛巾。铁皮樵夫哭了好几分钟。多萝西仔细盯着他流出的眼泪，用毛巾擦干。樵夫哭完，真诚地感谢多萝西，并用镶嵌着宝石的油壶给自己从头到脚上了一遍油，免得生锈。

稻草人现在是翡翠城的统治者。尽管他不是一位巫师，但人们还是为他感到骄傲。“因为，”他们说，“世界上再没有哪座城市是由稻草人统治的。”据他们所知，他们这说法完全正确。

气球带着奥兹飞走后的那个早晨，四位旅行者聚在觐见室商量。稻草人坐在大宝座上，其他人恭敬地站在他面前。

“我们并不算太不走运，”新统治者说，“因为这座宫殿和翡翠城属于我们，我们可以随心所愿。我记得我不久前还被农夫绑在玉米地里的一根竿子上，现在却成了这座美丽城市的统治者，我对我的命运很满意。”

“我也是，”铁皮樵夫说，“对自己的新心很满意；说真的，它是我在世界上唯一想要的东西。”

“至于我，我现在就算不比世界上其他野兽更勇敢，也至少和他们一样勇敢。知道这一点，我就心满意足。”狮子谦虚地说。

“要是多萝西乐意住在翡翠城，”稻草人说，“我们就都能开心地在一起了。”

“可是我不想住在这儿，”多萝西叫道，“我想回堪萨斯，同艾姆婶婶和亨利叔叔一起住。”

“噢，这可怎么办？”樵夫问。

稻草人决心想个办法，他绞尽脑汁，大头针和缝衣针都开始钻出他的脑袋。最后，他说：

“为什么不召唤飞猴，让他们带你飞越沙漠？”

“我从来没想过这个！”多萝西开心地说，“就这么办。我马上去拿金冠。”

多萝西把金冠拿进觐见室，念起咒语。不一会儿，那群飞猴从敞开的窗户飞进房间，落在她身旁。

“这是您第二次召唤我们。”猴王朝小姑娘鞠了一躬说，“您有什么愿望？”

“我想请你们带我飞回堪萨斯。”多萝西回答。

猴王听了这话，摇摇头。

“那可办不到，”他说，“我们只属于这个国度，不能离开。堪萨斯还从来没有过飞猴，我想以后也不会有，因为他们不属于那里。我们愿意在我们能力范围之内为您效力，但我们不能飞越沙漠。再见。”

猴王又鞠了一躬，然后展开翅膀，从窗口飞走了，他的猴群也跟着飞走了。

多萝西失望得快要哭出来了。

“我白白浪费了一次金冠的魔力，”她说，“因为飞猴帮不了我。”

“这真是太糟糕了！”心软的樵夫说。

稻草人又在想办法，他的脑袋鼓胀得很厉害，多萝西害怕它会爆炸。

“我们叫绿胡子士兵进来，”稻草人说道，“问问他有什么建议。”

随后，士兵被召见，他胆怯地走进觐见室，因为奥兹在这里时，从来不许他跨进房门。

“这个小姑娘，”稻草人对士兵说道，“想越过沙漠。她该怎么办？”

“我不知道，”士兵回答，“因为除了奥兹本人，还没有谁曾越过沙漠。”

“没有人能帮助我吗？”多萝西诚恳地问。

“格林达也许能。”士兵建议道。

“格林达是谁？”稻草人问。

“她是南方女巫，在所有女巫中魔力最大，统治着夸德令人。还有，她的城堡在沙漠边上，所以也许她知道怎么越过沙漠。”

“格林达是位好女巫，对吗？”小姑娘问。

“夸德令人认为她很好，”士兵说，“而且她对每个人都很友善。我听说格林达是个美丽的女人，她知道怎样保持青春，尽管她已经活了许多年。”

“那我怎样才能到她的城堡去？”多萝西问。

“那条路直通南方，”士兵回答，“但据说对旅行者充满危险。树林里有野兽，还有一群不喜欢陌生人经过他们国度的怪人。因此，没有一个夸德令人来过翡翠城。”

士兵告退后，稻草人说：

“尽管充满危险，但多萝西似乎最好还是到南方去，请格林达帮助她。因为，毫无疑问，要是多萝西待在这儿，她就永远回不了堪萨斯。”

“你肯定又考虑过这个办法吧。”铁皮樵夫说。

“是的。”稻草人回答。

“我要和多萝西一起走，”狮子说，“因为我厌倦了你的城市，渴望到树林和乡野中去。你知道，我的确是一头野兽。再说，多萝西需要人来保护她。”

“没错。”樵夫表示同意，“我的斧头可能派得上用场，所以我也要和她一起去南方。”

“我们什么时候出发？”稻草人问。

“你也走？”大家吃惊地反问。

“当然。要不是多萝西，我绝不会有脑子。她把我从玉米地里的竿子上解下来，带我来到翡翠城。所以，我的好运都出于她，在她永远回堪萨斯之前，我绝不会离开她。”

“谢谢你们。”多萝西感激地说，“你们对我真好。可我想尽快出发。”

“我们明天一早就走。”稻草人回答道，“现在大家做好准备，因为这将是一次漫长的旅行。”





第十九章　遭到卫士树袭击


第二天早晨，多萝西吻别漂亮的绿姑娘，大家都与绿胡子士兵握了手，士兵一直把他们送到翡翠城大门口。守门人又见到了大家，听说他们要离开这座美丽的城市，陷入新的麻烦，他十分惊讶。但守门人马上解下他们的眼镜，放回绿箱子，又对他们说了许多祝福的话。

“您现在是我们的统治者，”守门人对稻草人说，“所以您必须尽快回来。”

“只要我能，肯定会的，”稻草人回答，“但我得先帮多萝西回家。”

多萝西最后一次告别和蔼的守门人，她说：

“我在你们这座美丽的城市受到了友善的招待，每个人都对我很好。你不知道我有多么感谢你们。”

“别这样说，亲爱的，”守门人说，“我们很想留住你，但既然你想回堪萨斯，我希望你能找到办法。”说完，他打开外墙上的大门，大家走出大门，踏上旅途。

我们的朋友们转身面朝南方的土地，灿烂的阳光照耀他们。大家兴高采烈，有说有笑。多萝西又满怀着回家的希望。稻草人和铁皮樵夫为自己能帮上多萝西而开心。再看狮子，他快活地嗅着新鲜空气，因为回到乡野而开心地来回摆动尾巴。托托围着大家跑，追逐飞蛾和蝴蝶，不住地欢叫。

“城市生活根本不适合我，”大家步子轻快地赶路时，狮子评论道，“住进翡翠城以后，我瘦了许多，现在我真等不及去让其他野兽看看我已经变得多么勇敢。”

这时，大家转身看了翡翠城最后一眼。只见绿色城墙后面一片高楼和尖塔，它们之上高高耸立着奥兹宫殿的尖顶和圆顶。

“奥兹毕竟不是一位那么糟糕的巫师。”铁皮樵夫说，他感觉到心在胸膛里跳动。

“他知道怎么给我脑子，还是很好用的脑子。”稻草人说。

“如果奥兹喝一口他给我的那种胆量，”狮子补充道，“他就会成为一个勇敢的人。”

多萝西什么也没说。奥兹没有履行对她的诺言，但他尽了力，于是她原谅了奥兹。就像奥兹自己说的一样，他虽然是位糟糕的巫师，但是个好人。

第一天，几位旅行者穿过了在翡翠城四周延伸的绿色原野和艳丽花丛。夜晚，他们睡在草地上，只披盖着漫天的繁星，睡得实在香甜。

早晨，他们继续赶路，一直来到一片茂密的森林边。这树林好像朝左朝右都看不到尽头，没有办法绕过去，再说，大家害怕迷路，也不敢换个方向走。所以，他们要找一个最容易进入森林的地方。

稻草人走在最前面，他终于发现了一棵枝干舒展的大树，树下的空间足够这群人通过。于是，稻草人朝大树走去，他刚到最外层的树枝下面，就见树枝突然弯下来缠住他，紧接着，他被从地上举起来，头冲前被猛地扔回了这群旅行者中间。

稻草人没有受伤，但他惊呆了。多萝西扶他起来时，他好像晕头转向的。

“树之间还有一个地方。”狮子说。

“让我先试一试，”稻草人说，“因为我被扔来扔去也不会受伤。”他说着向另一棵树走去，但树枝立刻缠住他，又把他扔了回来。

“真奇怪。”多萝西叫道，“我们怎么办？”

“这些树好像打定主意要和我们作对，不让我们过去。”狮子说。

“我相信我可以来试一试。”樵夫说着，扛起斧头，直朝刚才粗暴对待稻草人的第一棵树走去。当一根大树枝弯下来抓他时，樵夫挥动斧头猛砍，把树枝砍成了两段。顿时，大树开始摇晃所有的树枝，像是被砍疼了。铁皮樵夫安全地从树下通过了。

“跟上！”他冲其他人喊，“快点！”

大家都跑过去，安然无恙地从树下通过。可是托托被一根小树枝缠住摇晃，它嚎叫起来。不过，稻草人立刻砍断树枝，解救了小狗。

森林里其他的树没有拦阻他们，所以他们认定只有最外层的树才能弯下树枝，也许它们是森林的卫士，所以被赋予这种神奇的能力，好把陌生人拦在森林外。

四位旅行者轻松地从树木间穿过，一直走到森林边上。这时，他们惊奇地发现前面有一堵高墙，好像是白瓷砌成的。这墙像碟子表面一样光滑，比他们几个都高。

“我们现在怎么办？”多萝西问。

“我来做一架梯子，”铁皮樵夫说道，“因为我们肯定得爬过墙去。”





第二十章　精致的瓷国


在樵夫用他从森林里找到的木料做梯子时，多萝西躺下睡着了，她因为长途跋涉而感到疲倦。狮子也蜷起身子睡着了，托托趴在他身边。

稻草人专注地看着樵夫干活儿，说：

“我想不明白这儿为什么有堵墙，也不知道它用什么砌成。”

“歇歇你的脑子吧，别想墙的事了。”樵夫答道，“等我们翻过去，就知道那边是什么了。”

过了一会儿，梯子做好了。它看上去很粗陋，但铁皮樵夫确信它十分结实，能够满足他们的需要。稻草人叫醒多萝西、狮子和托托，告诉他们梯子做好了。稻草人第一个爬上梯子，可他太笨手笨脚，多萝西不得不紧紧跟在他后边，怕他摔下来。当稻草人脑袋探过墙头时，他惊叫道：

“噢，天啊！”

“继续爬。”多萝西大声催促。

于是，稻草人爬上去，坐在墙头上。多萝西也像稻草人一样，把脑袋探过墙头，叫道：

“噢，天啊！”

这时，托托也爬了上去，立马开始吠叫，多萝西让它安静下来。

狮子跟在托托后头，铁皮樵夫在最后；当他俩爬上梯子，往墙那边一望，都惊叫道：“噢，天啊！”最后，大家在墙头上坐成一排，向下望去，看到了奇异的景象。

他们面前是一片广阔的原野，地面像大盘底一样光滑、闪亮、洁白。原野上散布着许多房子，里里外外都是瓷的，色彩绚烂无比。这些房子很小巧，最大的只到多萝西的腰那么高。还有一些漂亮的小牲口棚，四周围着瓷栅栏；成群的牛、羊、马、猪和鸡也都是瓷的。

不过，最奇妙的还是住在这个奇异国度里的人。挤奶女工和牧羊女穿着色彩鲜艳的上衣和缀满金点的裙子；公主们穿着金色、银色和紫色的华美连衣裙；牧羊人穿着粉黄蓝三色条纹的齐膝短裤，鞋子上缀着金色鞋扣；王子们头戴珠宝冠冕，穿着貂皮礼袍和绸缎紧身上衣；滑稽的小丑身穿有褶皱饰边的长袍，脸颊上涂着红点，带着尖顶高帽。最奇异的是，这些人全是瓷的，就连他们的衣服也是瓷的，他们非常小，其中最高的只到多萝西的膝盖。

起初，瓷人们谁也没有注意到这几位旅行者，只有一只紫色的大脑袋小瓷狗来到墙边，细声朝他们吠叫，然后又跑走了。

“我们怎么下去呢？”多萝西问。

他们发现梯子太重，拉不上去。于是，稻草人从墙上倒下去，其他人再跳到他身上，这样就不会被坚硬的地面弄伤脚。当然，大家都很小心，不踩到稻草人的头，免得被针扎伤脚。所有人都安全落地之后，大家拾起被踩扁的稻草人，把他拍回原来的形状。

“我们必须穿过这个奇怪的地方，到另一边去，”多萝西说，“因为除了正南方，走其他的路都不明智。”

大家开始穿过瓷国。他们最先遇到的是一位瓷做的挤奶女工，她在给一头瓷牛挤奶。他们走近时，奶牛突然尥蹶子，踢翻了板凳、牛奶桶甚至挤奶女工，这些都摔倒在白瓷地面上，发出哗啦一声巨响。

多萝西惊讶地发现，奶牛断了一条腿，牛奶桶摔成了几块小瓷片，而可怜的挤奶女工左胳膊肘碰裂了一道缝。

“瞧！”挤奶女工生气地喊道，“看看你们干了些什么！我的牛断了一条腿，我得带它去修补匠那儿，把腿重新粘上。你们来这儿吓唬我的牛，算怎么回事？”

“对不起，”多萝西回答，“请原谅我们。”

可是，漂亮的挤奶女工气坏了，没搭理多萝西。她气呼呼地拾起牛腿，牵上牛就走。那头可怜的牛用三条腿一瘸一拐地跟着她。女工一边走，一边几次回头愤恨地看着这群笨手笨脚的外乡人，并把裂了缝的胳膊肘紧贴着身子。

多萝西为他们闯了祸而难过。

“我们在这儿要格外小心，”善良的樵夫说，“不然我们会伤害这些漂亮的小人，让他们永远也复原不了。”

多萝西又往前走了没多久，遇上一位衣着十分漂亮的年轻公主。公主见到这些外乡人，突然站住了，转身要跑。

多萝西想再看看这位公主，就跟她跑。可瓷公主喊道：

“别追我！别追我！”

多萝西听见她细小、惶恐的声音，就停住脚步问道：

“为什么？”

“因为，”公主也停下来，和多萝西保持一段安全距离，“我跑起来可能会摔倒，伤到自己。”

“可是你不能被修补吗？”小姑娘问。

“噢，可以。可是你知道吗，一个人被修补过后，就没有这么漂亮了。”公主回答说。

“我想是的。”多萝西说。

“我们这儿有一位笑话先生。”瓷公主接着说，“他是个小丑，总是用头倒立，经常把自己摔破，所以身上修补过上百处，样子一点也不好看。瞧，他来了。你自己看吧。”

还真是，一位快活的小个子小丑正向他们走来。多萝西看见他尽管穿着红黄绿三色的漂亮衣服，但身上布满朝各个方向开裂的细纹，这清楚地表明他被修补过很多处。

小丑手抄口袋，鼓起双颊，顽皮地朝他们点点头，说道：

“我美丽的姑娘，

你为什么凝望

可怜的笑话老先生？

你这副样子真呆愣，

又是多么羞涩，

像吞了一张扑克！”

“安静，先生！”公主说，“你没看到这几位外乡人吗？你该尊重他们。”

“那么，我希望这个表示尊重。”小丑说着，马上用头倒立。

“别介意笑话先生，”公主对多萝西说，“他头上的裂缝太严重了，让他变得很傻。”

“噢，我一点也不介意。”多萝西说，“可是你非常漂亮，”她接着说，“我真的非常喜欢你。我能把你带回堪萨斯，摆在艾姆婶婶的壁炉架上吗？我可以把你装在篮子里带走。”

“那样我会很不开心。”瓷公主说，“你看，我们在自己的国度里活得很幸福，可以随意说话、走动。但是，我们中的任何人一旦被带走，关节就会立刻僵硬，只能直直站着当一件漂亮的摆设了。当然，人们对我们的全部期望，就是在壁炉架上、橱柜里还有客厅桌上当漂亮摆设。但我们在自己的国度里活得愉快得多。”

“我绝对不会让你不开心！”多萝西大声说，“所以我们就此再见吧。”

“再见。”公主说。

大家小心翼翼地从瓷国穿过。路上，小动物和所有人都赶紧跑开，怕这些外乡人损坏他们。大概走了一个小时，旅行者们来到瓷国的另一边，这里又有一堵瓷墙。

不过，这堵墙没有第一堵那么高，于是大家踩着狮子的后背，登上墙头。之后，狮子蹲下来一跃身，也上去了；可他起跳时，尾巴扫翻了一座瓷教堂，它摔成了碎片。

“太糟糕了。”多萝西说，“不过，我倒真的觉得我们挺幸运，除了跌断一条牛腿、打翻一座教堂，并没有给这些小人造成更大的伤害。他们都这么脆弱！”

“是啊。”稻草人说，“而我很庆幸自己是稻草做的，不容易损坏。这世界上还有比做稻草人更糟糕的事。”





第二十一章　狮子成为万兽之王


大家从瓷墙上下来之后，来到一片荒凉的原野。这里到处是沼泽和泥塘，地上长满又高又密的野草，遮住了许多泥坑，一不小心就会踩进去。不过，大家都小心翼翼地往前走，直到安全地踏上坚实的地面。但眼前这片原野似乎更加荒凉。大家在矮树丛中穿行了很长时间，疲惫不堪地走进了又一片森林。这里的树比他们之前见过的任何树都要高大古老。

“这片森林可爱极了，”狮子高兴地朝四周张望，“我从没见过比这儿更美的地方。”

“这里看起来阴森森的。”稻草人说。

“一点也不，”狮子答道，“我真想在这里住上一辈子。你看，脚下的干树叶多么软和，老树上的苔藓长得多密多绿啊。肯定没有野兽能想到一处比这里更舒服的窝。”

“也许这森林里有野兽。”多萝西说。

“我想是的，”狮子回答，“但是我一头也没看见。”

他们穿过森林，直到夜色太深、看不见路时才停下休息。多萝西、托托和狮子躺下休息，铁皮樵夫和稻草人像往常一样为他们放哨。

第二天一早，他们又上路了。大家没走多远，就听见一阵低沉的隆隆声，像是许多野兽一齐吼叫。托托呜呜叫了几声，但其余的人谁也不害怕，他们沿着被踩得路迹清晰的小径，来到林中一块空地。这里聚集着几百头各种野兽，有老虎、大象、熊、狼和狐狸，还有自然史上所有其他的野兽。一时间，多萝西感到害怕。不过，狮子向大家解释，这是动物们在开会，他从咆哮声和吼叫声可以听出来，他们遇上了大麻烦。

狮子正说话，几头野兽发现了他，聚集的大兽群像中了魔法一样，猛然间安静下来。这时，最大的一只老虎走到狮子面前，鞠了个躬，说：

“欢迎您，万兽之王！您来得正及时，请帮我们打败敌人，让森林里的所有动物重获安宁吧。”

“你们遇到什么麻烦了？”狮子平静地问。

“我们都受到了威胁。”老虎回答，“森林里最近来了一个凶猛的家伙。这个庞然大物长得像一只巨型蜘蛛，身子有大象那么大，八条腿跟树干一样长。这怪物在森林里爬行，用一条腿捉住一头动物送进嘴里，就好像蜘蛛捕食苍蝇。只要这个凶猛的家伙活着，我们就全都不安全，所以我们召开大会，商讨怎么保护自己。就在这时，您来了。”

狮子想了一想，问：

“这片森林里还有别的狮子吗？”

“没有。从前有过几头，可后来全被怪物吃了。再说，那几头狮子都没有您这样高大勇敢。”

“如果我为你们除掉敌人，你们愿意俯身尊我为森林之王吗？”狮子问。

“我们乐意。”老虎回答道。别的动物全都高声吼叫：“我们愿意！”

“你们说的大蜘蛛在哪儿？”狮子问。

“在那边的橡树丛里。”老虎说，用前爪给狮子指路。

“请照顾好我的这几位朋友，”狮子说，“我马上就去打那怪物。”

说完，狮子告别伙伴们，迈着骄傲的步子去与敌人决斗。

狮子找到大蜘蛛时，蜘蛛正在睡觉，它长得丑极了，狮子看见它就厌恶地皱起鼻子。它的腿确实像老虎说的一样长，浑身布满黑色粗毛。它有一张大嘴，里面长着一排一英尺长的尖牙。但它的头和圆滚滚的身子却由蜂腰一样细的脖子连起来。这让狮子想出了攻击怪物的最好办法。他趁怪物睡着比较容易袭击，纵身一跃，正扑上它后背，接着挥起长着利爪的厚实前掌，猛地把蜘蛛的头从身子上打了下来。随后，狮子跳下来，盯着大蜘蛛，一直等到它的长腿不再抽搐，确定它死了才离开。

狮子回到空地那里，森林里的动物正等着他。他骄傲地说：

“你们不用再害怕你们的敌人了。”

于是，野兽们俯身尊狮子为王。狮子答应他们，等多萝西安全地回堪萨斯，他就马上回来统治他们。





第二十二章　夸德令国


四位旅行者安全地走过了森林里的余下路程。他们刚走出阴暗的森林，又遇上一座陡峭的山，从山顶到山脚都覆盖着大石块。

“这座山很难爬，”稻草人说，“但我们必须翻过去。”

于是，稻草人领路，大家跟着他。他们刚要爬上最下面的一块石头，突然一个粗鲁的声音喊道：

“别过来！”

“你是谁？”稻草人问。接着，一个脑袋从石头后面探出来，那个声音又说：

“这座山是我们的，任何人都不许过去。”

“但我们必须过去，”稻草人说，“我们要去夸德令国。”

“你们不能过去！”那声音回答。话音刚落，从石头后面走出一个人，旅行者们从没见过这么奇特的长相。

这人矮墩墩的，布满皱纹的粗脖子上长着一颗头顶扁平的大脑袋。更怪的是，他没有胳膊。稻草人看到这情景，并不害怕，他觉得这个无助的家伙并不能拦阻大家翻山赶路。于是，稻草人一边勇敢地往前走，一边说：

“很抱歉，我们不能按你说的办，不管你愿意不愿意，我们都必须翻过山去。”

突然，那人闪电般飞快地伸展脖子，嗖地射出脑袋，拿扁平的头顶击中了稻草人的腰。稻草人被撞翻了，骨碌碌滚下山。转眼间，那脑袋又迅速缩回去，那人刺耳地笑着说：

“没你想得那么简单！”

一阵狂笑从其他石头后面传出。多萝西看见山坡上有几百个长着锤子头的没有胳膊的人，每块石头后面都有一个。

狮子听见他们嘲笑稻草人滚下山坡，非常生气。他怒吼一声，冲上山坡，吼声像雷一样隆隆回响。

这时，一个脑袋又嗖地射出，狮子像被炮弹击中一样，滚下山坡。

多萝西跑下去扶起稻草人。狮子浑身肿痛，走过来对多萝西说：

“和这些会发射脑袋的人打也没用；谁也抵挡不住他们。”

“那我们怎么办？”多萝西问。

“召唤飞猴，”铁皮樵夫说，“你还有一次使唤他们的权力。”

“太好了。”多萝西说着，戴上金冠，念起了咒语。飞猴像往常一样迅速，不一会儿整个猴群就站在了多萝西面前。

“您有什么吩咐？”猴王深鞠一躬，问道。

“请带我们飞过这座山，去夸德令国。”小姑娘回答。

“遵命。”猴王说。飞猴们立刻托起四位旅行者和托托，带着他们飞去。他们飞过山上时，长着锤子头的人气得大叫，把脑袋高高地射向空中，但他们够不到飞猴。飞猴们托着多萝西和她的伙伴们安全地飞越石山，把他们送到了美丽的夸德令国。

“这是您最后一次能召唤我们，”猴王对多萝西说，“再见，祝您好运。”

“再见，非常感谢你们。”小姑娘回答。随后，飞猴们飞上天空，转眼不见踪影。

夸德令国看起来富裕幸福。平坦的小路隔开一片连一片的成熟稻田，潺潺的溪流穿田而过，溪上架着坚固的桥。篱笆、房子和桥都漆成鲜红色，像在温基国漆成黄色，在芒奇金国漆成蓝色一样。夸德令人又矮又胖，长得圆滚滚的，他们性格温和，都穿着红衣服，红色在绿草和变黄的稻谷映衬下格外鲜艳。

飞猴们把他们放在一间农舍旁。四位旅行者走过去敲门。一位农妇打开了门，多萝西问她要一些吃的。于是，农妇请大家吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐，有三种蛋糕、四种饼干，还给了托托一碗牛奶。

“这里离格林达的城堡有多远？”小姑娘问。

“不是很远，”农妇回答，“沿着这条路往南走，很快就到了。”

大家谢过这位好心的农妇，又起身上路。他们穿过稻田，走过精巧的小桥，一直来到一座美丽的城堡前。城门由三位年轻姑娘守卫，她们都身穿漂亮的镶着金穗带的红色制服。见多萝西走过来，其中一个说：

“你为什么来南方国度？”

“来拜见统治这里的好女巫，”多萝西答道，“你能带我去见她吗？”

“请你们报上名来，我去请示格林达，看她是不是愿意见你们。”于是，大家把名字告诉女卫兵，那姑娘就走进城堡去了。不一会儿，她回来对多萝西他们说，格林达请他们立即进城堡。





第二十三章　好女巫让多萝西心愿成真


大家在见到格林达之前，被带进城堡里的一个房间。多萝西洗了脸，梳好头；狮子抖落鬃毛里的尘土；稻草人把身体拍打成最好的形状；樵夫擦亮铁皮，给关节上足油。

等大家的样子都很拿得出手后，他们就跟着女卫兵走进一个大房间，只见女巫格林达坐在一张红宝石宝座上。

在大家看来，格林达美丽又年轻。她长着飘逸的大红色披肩卷发，穿着洁白的裙子，一双蓝眼睛温和地望着小姑娘。

“有什么事我能帮上忙吗，孩子？”她问。

多萝西把自己的全部经历告诉了女巫——怎样被旋风带到奥兹国，怎样遇到她的伙伴们，还有他们的奇妙历险。

“现在我最大的愿望，”多萝西说，“就是回堪萨斯。艾姆婶婶一定以为我遭遇了不幸，她会为我办丧事；除非今年庄稼收成比去年好，不然亨利叔叔肯定负担不起。”

格林达倾身向前，亲吻这位可爱的小姑娘扬起的甜美脸颊。

“你真好心，”她说，“我相信我能给你指一条去堪萨斯的路。”她接着说，“不过，要我这么做，你得把金冠给我。”

“我愿意！”多萝西叫道，“其实，它现在对我没用了。你拿到金冠后，可以使唤飞猴三次。”

“我想我恰好需要他们为我办三件事。”格林达微笑着说。

多萝西随后把金冠给了格林达。女巫问稻草人：

“多萝西离开我们之后，你打算做什么？”

“我要回到翡翠城，”稻草人回答，“因为奥兹让我统治那座城，那里的人们喜爱我。只有一件事让我发愁，就是怎样越过长着锤子头的人住的那座山。”

“我将用金冠召唤飞猴送你到翡翠城门口，”格林达说，“让人们失去这样好的一位统治者，是不应当的。”

“我真的那么好？”稻草人问。

“你与众不同。”格林达答道。

她又转向铁皮樵夫，问：

“多萝西离开这个国度之后，你打算做什么？”

樵夫靠着斧头，想了一会儿，说：

“温基人对我很好，坏女巫死后，他们想请我统治他们。我很喜欢温基人，如果能回西方国度，我最想做的就是永远统治他们。”

“我对飞猴的第二个命令，”格林达说，“将是让他们把你安全地送到温基国。你的脑袋不像稻草人的那么大，可你擦得亮闪闪的时候，确实比他聪明。我相信你能明智地治理好温基国。”

接着，女巫看着鬃毛乱蓬蓬的大狮子，问：

“多萝西回到她的家乡之后，你打算做什么？”

“在锤子头人住的山的那一边，”狮子回答，“有一片古老的大森林，那里的万兽尊我为王。只要我能回到那片森林，我就在那里快乐地度过一生。”

“我对飞猴的第三个命令，”格林达说，“将是送你到森林去。等用完金冠的魔力之后，我会把它还给猴王，那样猴王和他的猴群从此以后就永远自由了。”

听到这话，稻草人、铁皮樵夫和狮子诚恳地向好女巫道谢，感谢她的美意。这时，多萝西大声说：

“您的确美丽又善良！不过，您还没告诉我怎么回堪萨斯。”

“你的银鞋会带你飞越沙漠。”格林达回答，“要是你早了解这双鞋的魔力，那来这个国度的第一天，你就能回到艾姆婶婶身边去。”

“可是，那样我就不会有美妙的脑子了！”稻草人叫道，“我可能一生都将待在农夫的玉米地里。”

“我就不会有这颗可爱的心了，”铁皮樵夫说，“我可能会一直站在森林里，永远锈住。”

“而我将永远是一个胆小鬼，”狮子说，“所有森林里没有一只动物会对我说句好话。”

“你们说得都很对，”多萝西说，“我很高兴能帮助这些好朋友。现在你们每一位都得到了自己最渴望的东西，还很高兴地要去统治一座王国。那么，我想我该回堪萨斯了。”

“银鞋，”好女巫说，“有神奇的魔力。最不寻常的一点是，你只要走三步，它就能把你带到世界上任何地方，每一步都只要一眨眼工夫。你要做的就是把两只鞋跟撞三下，然后叫银鞋把你带到任何你想去的地方。”

“真是这样的话，”小姑娘高兴地说，“我要银鞋马上带我回堪萨斯。”

她张开双臂抱住狮子的脖子亲吻他，温柔地拍拍他的大脑袋。接着，她又亲吻铁皮樵夫，樵夫哭了，泪水对他的关节十分危险。最后，她抱住稻草人填满稻草的柔软身体，但没有亲吻他油漆画出的脸。多萝西伤心地告别亲爱的伙伴们，自己也忍不住哭了。

善良的格林达走下红宝石宝座，与小姑娘吻别。多萝西感谢格林达对她和她的朋友这么好。

于是，多萝西郑重地抱起托托，与大家最后道别了一声，然后把两只鞋跟撞了三下，说：

“带我去艾姆婶婶家！”




多萝西立即被带到空中，她飞速旋转着，只能看到、感觉到风在耳边呼啸。

银鞋只带着她走了三步，就突然停下了。多萝西在草地上滚了好几圈，才反应过来自己在哪里。

最后，她坐起来，环顾四周。

“天啊！”多萝西叫道。

原来，她正坐在堪萨斯广阔的草原上，面前是一座新房，是亨利叔叔在旧屋被旋风吹走后建造的。这时候，亨利叔叔正在牲口棚里给奶牛挤奶。托托已经从多萝西怀里跳下来，欢乐地狂吠着跑向牲口棚。

多萝西站起身，发现自己脚上只穿着袜子。原来，她在空中飞行的时候，银鞋掉了下去，永远地丢失在沙漠里了。





第二十四章　回到家乡


艾姆婶婶这时恰好走出房子，来给卷心菜浇水，她抬头看见多萝西朝自己跑来。

“我亲爱的孩子！”她叫喊着，把小姑娘搂在怀中一个劲儿地亲吻，“你到底去哪儿了？”

“去奥兹国了，”多萝西郑重地说，“还有托托。噢，艾姆婶婶！回到家里，我真是太高兴了！”

Introduction


Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal．The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations. Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as “historical” in the children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer “wonder tales” in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale．Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident. Having this thought in mind, the story of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” was written solely to please children of today．It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.

Chapter 1 The Cyclone


Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife．Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles．There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds．Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner．There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path．It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.

When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side．Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions．The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it．Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere．Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.

When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife．The sun and wind had changed her, too．They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also．She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now．When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.

Uncle Henry never laughed．He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was．He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings．Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose．Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.

Today, however, they were not playing．Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual．Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too．Aunt Em was washing the dishes.

From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm．There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.

Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.

“There's a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife．“I'll go look after the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.

Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door．One glance told her of the danger close at hand.

“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed．“Run for the cellar!”

Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him．Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole．Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt．When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.

Then a strange thing happened.

The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air．Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.

The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone．In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.

It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily．After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.

Toto did not like it．He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.

Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him．But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall．She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.

Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf．At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring．At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.

In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.





Chapter 2 The Council with the Munchkins


She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt．As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally．Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room．She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.

The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.

The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty．There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits．Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes．A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.

While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen．They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small．In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.

Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed．They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved．The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders．Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds．The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops．The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards．But the little woman was doubtless much older．Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.

When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther．But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:

“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins．We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.”

Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder．What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.

But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with hesitation,

“You are very kind, but there must be some mistake．I have not killed anything.”

“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh, “and that is the same thing．See!” she continued, pointing to the corner of the house．“There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.”

Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright．There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.

“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay．“The house must have fallen on her．Whatever shall we do?”

“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.

“But who was she?” asked Dorothy.

“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the little woman．“She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day．Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.”

“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.

“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.”

“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.

“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North．When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once．I am the Witch of the North.”

“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy．“Are you a real witch?”

“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman．“But I am a good witch, and the people love me．I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”

“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch.

“Oh, no, that is a great mistake．There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches．I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken．Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one who lives in the West.”

“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, “Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”

“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.

“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”

The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground．Then she looked up and said,

“I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before．But tell me, is it a civilized country?”

“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.

“Then that accounts for it．In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians．But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world．Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.”

“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.

“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her voice to a whisper．“He is more powerful than all the rest of us together．He lives in the City of Emeralds.”

Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.

“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh．The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes.

“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up quickly in the sun．That is the end of her．But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.

“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.”

Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table．Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:

“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me．Can you help me find my way?”

The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.

“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert, and none could live to cross it.”

“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been there and seen it．The South is the country of the Quadlings.”

“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the West．And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”

“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz．I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us.”

Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people．Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also．As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three” in a solemn voice．At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:

“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”

The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked,

“Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”

“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.

“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds．Perhaps Oz will help you.”

“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.

“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of.”

“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.

“He is a good Wizard．Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him.”

“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.

“You must walk．It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible．However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.”

“Won't you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.

“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.”

She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead．Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.

“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the Witch, “so you cannot miss it．When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you．Good-bye, my dear.”

The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees．The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by.

But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.





Chapter 3 How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow


When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry．So she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter．She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water．Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there．Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.

Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.

Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed．It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock．The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head．She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top．Then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.

“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said．And Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.

At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the Witch of the East.

“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto．“They would be just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”

She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.

Finally she picked up her basket.

“Come along, Toto,” she said．“We will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”

She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress．And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.

There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks．Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed．The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.

She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her．There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance．Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops．Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage．The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof．All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.

Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest．On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing．Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.

The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.

Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself, whose name was Boq．Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.

When Boq saw her silver shoes he said,

“You must be a great sorceress.”

“Why?” asked the girl.

“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch．Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white.”

“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the wrinkles in it.

“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq．“Blue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color．So we know you are a friendly witch.”

Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.

When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it．The sheets were made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.

She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy．Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before.

“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.

“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there．It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him．But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days．The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.”

This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.

She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick．When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down．There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.

Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow．Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face．An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw．On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.

While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her．She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way．Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.

“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.

“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.

“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow．“How do you do?”

“I'm pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely．“How do you do?”

“I'm not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”

“Can't you get down?” asked Dorothy.

“No, for this pole is stuck up my back．If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”

Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.

“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on the ground．“I feel like a new man.”

Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.

“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned．“And where are you going?”

“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”

“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired．“And who is Oz?”

“Why, don't you know?” she returned, in surprise.

“No, indeed．I don't know anything．You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brains at all,” he answered sadly.

“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I'm awfully sorry for you.”

“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that Oz would give me some brains?”

“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if you like．If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now.”

“That is true,” said the Scarecrow．“You see,” he continued confidentially, “I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed, because I cannot get hurt．If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it．But I do not want people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”

“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly sorry for him．“If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for you.”

“Thank you,” he answered gratefully.

They walked back to the road．Dorothy helped him over the fence, and they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.

Toto did not like this addition to the party at first．He smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.

“Don't mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend．“He never bites.”

“Oh, I'm not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow．“He can't hurt the straw．Do let me carry that basket for you．I shall not mind it, for I can't get tired．I'll tell you a secret,” he continued, as he walked along．“There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.”

“What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who made you?”

“No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it's a lighted match.”





Chapter 4 The Road Through the Forest


After a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks, which were here very uneven．Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around．As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks．It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap.

The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back．There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.

At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread．She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.

“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shape of my head.”

Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on eating her bread.

“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner．So she told him all about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer Land of Oz．The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said,

“I cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.”

“That is because you have no brains,” answered the girl．“No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful．There is no place like home.”

The Scarecrow sighed.

“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said．“If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all．It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”

“Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child.

The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:

“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever．I was only made day before yesterday．What happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me．Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on．There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying,

“‘How do you like those ears?’

“‘They aren't straight,’ answered the other.

“‘Never mind,’ said the farmer．‘They are ears just the same,’ which was true enough.

“‘Now I'll make the eyes,’ said the farmer．So he painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my first glimpse of the world.

“‘That's a rather pretty eye,’ remarked the Munchkin who was watching the farmer．‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’

“‘I think I'll make the other a little bigger,’ said the farmer．And when the second eye was done I could see much better than before．Then he made my nose and my mouth．But I did not speak, because at that time I didn't know what a mouth was for．I had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.

“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer．‘He looks just like a man.’

“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him．The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me．He and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone.

“I did not like to be deserted this way．So I tried to walk after them．But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole．It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made such a little while before．Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person．By and by an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said:

“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner．Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted．The other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me.

“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some of them．Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.’

“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try hard to get some brains．By good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.”

“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have them.”

“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow．“It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”

“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow.

There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled．Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick．It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest.

“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us.”

“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.

“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow．“If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”

After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness．Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day．So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.

“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark.”

Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.

“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs and branches．Shall we go there?”

“Yes, indeed,” answered the child．“I am all tired out.”

So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner．She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep．The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.





Chapter 5 The Rescue of the Tin Woodman


When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels．She sat up and looked around her．There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting for her.

“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.

“Why do you want water?” he asked.

“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat.”

“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink．However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”

They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast．She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.

When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.

“What was that?” she asked timidly.

“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”

Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them．They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees．She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise.

One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin．His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.

Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.

“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.

“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did．I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”

“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.

“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered．“They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again．You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”

Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”

“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman．So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.

“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said．And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new.

The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree.

“This is a great comfort,” he said．“I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at last．Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more.”

So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful.

“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he said; “so you have certainly saved my life．How did you happen to be here?”

“We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” she answered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”

“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.

“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head,” she replied.

The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment．Then he said:

“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”

“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered．“It would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains.”

“True,” the Tin Woodman returned．“So, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.”

“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company．So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick.

The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket．“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil-can badly.”

It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass．But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.

Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road．Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.

“Why didn't you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.

“I don't know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully．“My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains.”

“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman．“But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.”

“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.

“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman．“But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart.”

“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.

“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”

So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story:

“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living．When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived．Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.

“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart．She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever．But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework．So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage．Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.

“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper．So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin．The leg worked very well, once I was used to it．But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl．When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg．Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin．After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones．The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me．But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.

“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be．She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves．Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever．But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not．I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.

“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me．There was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it．However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me．It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart．While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one．If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”

Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.

“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.”

“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”

Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.

What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket．To be sure, neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.





Chapter 6 The Cowardly Lion


All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods．The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.

There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine．But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees．These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return.

“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman, “before we are out of the forest?”

“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald City．But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful．But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm.”

“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously．“What will protect him?”

“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin Woodman.

Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road．With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws．But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.

Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:

“Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”

“I didn't bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.

“No, but you tried to,” she retorted．“You are nothing but a big coward.”

“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame．“I've always known it．But how can I help it?”

“I don't know, I'm sure．To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!”

“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again.

“Of course he's stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still angry.

“That's why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion．“It astonished me to see him whirl around so．Is the other one stuffed also?”

“No,” said Dorothy, “he's made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up again.

“That's why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion．“When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back．What is that little animal you are so tender of?”

“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.

“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.

“Neither．He's a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.

“Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him．No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me,” continued the Lion sadly.

“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.

“It's a mystery,” replied the Lion．“I suppose I was born that way．All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts．I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way．Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go．If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself—I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.”

“But that isn't right．The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward,” said the Scarecrow.

“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail．“It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy．But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”

“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.

“It may be,” said the Lion.

“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart．For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease.”

“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not be a coward.”

“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.

“I suppose so．I've never looked to see,” replied the Lion.

“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked the Scarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”

“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.

“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,” added Dorothy.

“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.

“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.

“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.

“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.

“Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you,” said the Lion, “for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”

“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts．It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”

“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn't make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”

So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side．Toto did not approve of this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws．But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.

During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey．Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing．This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret．These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted．When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together．He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand．The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong．But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.

“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step．For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”

Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it．The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.

“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful．When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much.”





Chapter 7 The Journey to the Great Oz


They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near．The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely．She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.

“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you．You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast.”

“Don't! Please don't,” begged the Tin Woodman．“I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”

But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it．And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time．She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts．His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket．But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up．So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep．These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.

When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.

This was to be an eventful day for the travelers．They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side．It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom．The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.

“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.

“I haven't the faintest idea:” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful．But the Scarecrow said:

“We cannot fly, that is certain; neither can we climb down into this great ditch．Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are.”

“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.

“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.”

“Well, I'll try it,” said the Lion．“Who will go first?”

“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below．But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”

“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it．So get on my back and we will make the attempt.”

The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down.

“Why don't you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.

“Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things,” he replied．Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side．They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again.

Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand．The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side．The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.

They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy．After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again．To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.

“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.

“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto．I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.”

“I'm not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy．“They must be dreadful beasts.”

The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road．But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it.

So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Scarecrow said:

“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch．If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily.”

“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion．“One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”

The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through．Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.

They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.

“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.

“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow．“Let us cross over.”

So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next．The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise.

But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next．Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree．And the Lion said to Dorothy:

“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws．But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive.”

“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow．He had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch．The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.

“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive．Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”

“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”

This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride on the Lion's back．To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them．On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits．They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.

“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.

“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow．“The Tin Woodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”

So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit．This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.

But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done．So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.





Chapter 8 The Deadly Poppy Field


Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river．Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.

To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land．But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start．Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms．When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.

They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick．And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.

“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”

“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.

“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.

“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.

“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.

“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river．Then, before he could pull it out again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.

“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him．Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.

Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.

“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought．“Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate．But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river．I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!”

Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind．Then the Lion said:

“Something must be done to save us．I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail.”

So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail．Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore．It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's long pole and helped push the raft to the land.

They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.

“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him.

“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.

“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again,” remarked the Lion.

So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them．It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.

They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:

“Look!”

Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.

“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.

The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know．So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge.

“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.

“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”

“This isn't the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party.

“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again.”

“Where is he?” asked the Stork.

“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.

“If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the Stork.

“He isn't heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much.”

“Well, I'll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”

So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole．Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.

When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.

“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said, “but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”

“That's all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them．“I always like to help anyone in trouble．But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me．I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you.”

“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight.

They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them．There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.

“Aren't they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers.

“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow．“When I have brains, I shall probably like them better.”

“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.

“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion．“They seem so helpless and frail．But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”

They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies．Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever．But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.

But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.

“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,” he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him．So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer．Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.

“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.

“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion．“The smell of the flowers is killing us all．I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already.”

It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress．But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers.

“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can．We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”

So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go．In a moment he was out of sight.

“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow．So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.

On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end．They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies．The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them.

“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is much too heavy to lift．We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”

“I'm sorry,” said the Scarecrow．“The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly．But let us go on.”

They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.





Chapter 9 The Queen of the Field Mice


“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.”

The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them．It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire．As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.

So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.

The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:

“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”

“Don't speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman．“I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”

“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly．“Why, I am a Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”

“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.

“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving my life,” added the Queen.

At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed:

“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads.

“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my life．So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish.”

“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus．And then they scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group．Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.

But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he called to the mice: “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt you.”

At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice,

“Are you sure he will not bite us?”

“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”

One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again, although he tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin．Finally one of the biggest mice spoke.

“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the life of our Queen?”

“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly,

“Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”

“A Lion!” cried the little Queen．“Why, he would eat us all up.”

“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”

“Really?” asked the Mouse.

“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend．If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness.”

“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you．But what shall we do?”

“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to obey you?”

“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.

“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each one bring a long piece of string.”

The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people．As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible.

“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”

So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches．He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk．So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.

They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth．It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes．She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly．But the Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:

“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”

Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a courtesy, after which she became quite friendly with the little girl.

The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought．One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck．Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily．Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.

After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck．Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep.

At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and they got along better．Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.

Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death．She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had been rescued.

Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes．The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.

“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance．Good-bye!”

“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.

After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner.





Chapter 10 The Guardian of the Gate


It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.

“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the flowers were too strong for me．How did you get me out?”

Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:

“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life．How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?”

“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”

So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.

The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades．Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green．They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid．The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.

“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting near the Emerald City.”

“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow．“Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color．But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.”

“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I'm sure Toto is nearly starved．Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.”

So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked.

A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”

“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world.”

“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.

“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too．He will be more afraid of you than you are of him.”

“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep.”

So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man．The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner．They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:

“Where are you all going?”

“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”

“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man．“Are you sure that Oz will see you?”

“Why not?” she replied.

“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence．I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”

“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.

“Never．He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”

“What is he like?” asked the girl.

“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully．“You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes．So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat．To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him．But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”

“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”

“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.

“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.

“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man．“He has more brains than he needs.”

“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.

“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”

“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.

“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man, “which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over．He will be glad to give you some.”

“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.

“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.

“I don't know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and I'm sure it's somewhere.”

“Very likely．Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you．But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way．But what do you want?” he continued, speaking to Toto．Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.

The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal．The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions．The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all．Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.

The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed．The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.

The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.

“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.

As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels．Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City．It was high and thick and of a bright green color.

In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.

There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within．Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.

Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins．He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint．At his side was a large green box.

When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked,

“What do you wish in the Emerald City?”

“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.

The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.

“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said, shaking his head in perplexity．“He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”

“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the Scarecrow; “it is important．And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard.”

“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well．But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face．I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace．But first you must put on the spectacles.”

“Why?” asked Dorothy.

“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you．Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day．They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.”

He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape．All of them had green glasses in them．The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes．There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck．When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.

Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.

Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace．Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.





Chapter 11 The Wonderful Emerald City of Oz


Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City．The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds．They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun．The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.

There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins．They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them．Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green．Green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts．At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies.

There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them．Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.

The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard．There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.

“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they demand to see the Great Oz.”

“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to him.”

So they passed through the Palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds．The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely:

“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here.”

They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned．When, at last, he came back, Dorothy asked:

“Have you seen Oz?”

“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him．But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message．He said he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day．Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey.”

“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Oz.”

The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room．She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said,

“Follow me and I will show you your room.”

So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace．It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane．There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin．Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books．When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.

In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.

“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you wish for anything ring the bell．Oz will send for you tomorrow morning.”

She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others．These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace．Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning．It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world．The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order．The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.

The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin．Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.

First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes．These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Oz．As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered:

“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”

“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”

“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him．Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from．Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested．At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence.”

Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy,

“That is the signal．You must go into the Throne Room alone.”

She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place．It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together．In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.

But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room．It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else．In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever．There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.

As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily．Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a voice say:

“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible．Who are you, and why do you seek me?”

It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered:

“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek．I have come to you for help.”

The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute．Then said the voice:

“Where did you get the silver shoes?”

“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on her and killed her,” she replied.

“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice.

“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.

Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth．Then Oz asked,

“What do you wish me to do?”

“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she answered earnestly．“I don't like your country, although it is so beautiful．And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long.”

The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room．And at last they looked at Dorothy again.

“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.

“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl.”

“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said Oz.

“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”

“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer．You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return．In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets．If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first．Help me and I will help you.”

“What must I do?” asked the girl.

“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.

“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.

“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm．There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas—but not before.”

The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she could help him if she would.

“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed．“Even if I wanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”

“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again．Remember that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed．Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”

Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her.

“There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I can never do.”

Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.

The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said:

“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”

So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady．She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels．Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them.

When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said:

“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible．Who are you, and why do you seek me?”

Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.

“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw．Therefore I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.”

“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.

“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,” answered the Scarecrow.

“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I will promise．If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”

“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in surprise.

“So I did．I don't care who kills her．But until she is dead I will not grant your wish．Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire.”

The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.

“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the Tin Woodman.”

On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said:

“Oz has sent for you．Follow me.”

So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room．He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would be the lovely Lady．“For,” he said to himself, “if it is the Head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me．But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted.”

But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast．It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight．The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face．There were five long arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs．Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined．It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror．But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.

“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was one great roar．“Who are you, and why do you seek me?”

“I am a Woodman, and made of tin．Therefore I have no heart, and cannot love．I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”

“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.

“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the Woodman.

Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly:

“If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it.”

“How?” asked the Woodman.

“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast．“When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”

So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen．They all wondered greatly at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion said:

“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so frighten him that he will grant all I ask．And if he is the lovely Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my bidding．And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire．So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be well.”

The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.

The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it．His first thought was that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.

Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words it spoke:

“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible．Who are you, and why do you seek me?” And the Lion answered,

“I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything．I came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts, as men call me.”

“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.

“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request,” answered the Lion.

The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said,

“Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you courage．But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”

The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room．He was glad to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard.

“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.

“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and that is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy her.”

“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.

“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.

“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.

“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.

“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy, beginning to cry.

“Be careful!” cried the green girl．“The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it.”

So Dorothy dried her eyes and said,

“I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”

“I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch,” said the Lion.

“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool.”

“I haven't the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman; “but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”

Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled．The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better．The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy's basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto's neck with a green ribbon.

They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg.





Chapter 12 The Search for the Wicked Witch


The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived．This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.

“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.

“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates．“No one ever wishes to go that way.”

“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.

“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves.”

“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”

“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates．“No one has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you, as she has of the rest．But take care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her．Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”

They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups．Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white．The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy's dress.

The Emerald City was soon left far behind．As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled.

In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.

Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere．So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all about her．They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.

At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves．They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.

“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”

“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the wolves.

“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a Lion．None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces.”

“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed by the others.

It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming.

“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet them as they come.”

He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's head from its body, so that it immediately died．As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon．There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.

Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said,

“It was a good fight, friend.”

They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning．The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her all．She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.

Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off．She saw all her wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country．This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.

Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough to darken the sky．And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow,

“Fly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”

The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions．When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid．But the Scarecrow said,

“This is my battle, so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.”

So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up and stretched out his arms．And when the crows saw him they were frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer．But the King Crow said:

“It is only a stuffed man．I will peck his eyes out.”

The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died．And then another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also．There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him．Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey.

When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle.

Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her.

“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch, and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking．But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrow had decided what to do.

“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting them.” This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.

The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at all．And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.

Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as ever．So they started upon their journey once more.

The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth．And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them.

The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told．So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy．Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.

When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she should do next．She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to act.

There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it．This Golden Cap had a charm．Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given．But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times．Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap．Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country．The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this．The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West．The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this．Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted．But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.

So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head.

Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:

“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”

Next she stood upon her right foot and said:

“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”

After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:

“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”

Now the charm began to work．The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air．There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.

One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader．He flew close to the Witch and said,

“You have called us for the third and last time．What do you command?”

“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion,” said the Wicked Witch．“Bring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”

“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader．Then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking.

Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks．Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan.

Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head．They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree.

The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way．Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not escape.

But Dorothy they did not harm at all．She stood, with Toto in her arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn．The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her.

“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for she is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of Evil．All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there.”

So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her down upon the front doorstep．Then the leader said to the Witch:

“We have obeyed you as far as we were able．The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard．The little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms．Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.”

Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.

The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way．She looked down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them．At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her．So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and thought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to use her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:

“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow.”

Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.

With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive．But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.

“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through the bars of the gate, “I can starve you．You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish.”

So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked,

“Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?”

And the Lion would answer,

“No．If you come in this yard, I will bite you.”

The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard．After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape．But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.

The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand．But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her forehead．The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and Toto．Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return．The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.

Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again．Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress．Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.

Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore．Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost．She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them．But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath．The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing．Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way.

But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted．She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes．So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length．She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.

The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so.

The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch,

“Give me back my shoe!”

“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not yours.”

“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy．“You have no right to take my shoe from me.”

“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”

This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot.

Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.

“See what you have done!” she screamed．“In a minute I shall melt away.”

“I'm very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.

“Didn't you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice.

“Of course not,” answered Dorothy．“How should I?”

“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself．I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds．Look out—here I go!”

With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor．Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess．She then swept it all out the door．After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again．Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.





Chapter 13 The Rescue


The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free．They went in together to the castle, where Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves.

There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty．They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and dancing.

“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,” said the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”

“Don't you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl anxiously.

“We can try,” answered the Lion.

So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage．So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started away．They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent．His axe was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short.

The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry．When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:

“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”

“Oh, yes．Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.

“Then bring them to me,” she said．And when the tinsmiths came, bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired,

“Can you straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?”

The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever．So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever．To be sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.

When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted．At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away．As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried.

“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman, when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “I should be quite happy.”

“We must try to find him,” said the girl.

So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.

It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it; but the Woodman said at once,

“I'll chop it down, and then we can get the Scarecrow's clothes.”

Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old broken handle．Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver.

As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow's clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.

Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.

Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable.

But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said,

“We must go back to Oz, and claim his promise.”

“Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get my heart.”

“And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.

“And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.

“And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping her hands．“Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”

This they decided to do．The next day they called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye．The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West．Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.

Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.

Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap．She tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly．She did not know anything about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.

Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.





Chapter 14 The Winged Monkeys


You will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City．When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her．It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried．They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way．But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields．They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly．So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.

The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they were quite sure which way they were going.

“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall sometime come to some place.”

But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields．The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.

“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find it again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”

“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman．“It seems to me I can scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long journey.”

“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I haven't the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.”

Then Dorothy lost heart．She sat down on the grass and looked at her companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head．So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.

“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested．“They could probably tell us the way to the Emerald City.”

“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow．“Why didn't we think of that before?”

Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her．In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her．Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice:

“What can I do for my friends?”

“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy．“Can you tell us where the Emerald City is?”

“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off, for you have had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed Dorothy's Golden Cap, and said, “Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in less than an hour.”

“I didn't know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in surprise．“What is it?”

“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the Mice．“But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”

“Won't they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.

“Oh, no．They must obey the wearer of the Cap．Good-bye!” And she scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.

Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the lining．These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.

“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.

“What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was doing.

“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time on her right foot.

“Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.

“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet．This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them．The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked,

“What is your command?”

“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we have lost our way.”

“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her．Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them.

Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of them the King himself．They had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her.

“Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.

“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh; “but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish.”

“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.

“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master．Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest．But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day．This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land.

“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was also a powerful sorceress．All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good．Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby．Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise．At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years．Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish．When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.

“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner．One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river．He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do．At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.

“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and see if the water has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune．He laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore．But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.

“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it．She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river．But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap．This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom．Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be.”

“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story.

“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey, “he was the first to lay his wishes upon us．As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her.

“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West．Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.”

As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them．She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over．The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.

“That was a good ride,” said the little girl.

“Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion．“How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”





Chapter 15 The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible


The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the bell．After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the Gates they had met before.

“What! are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.

“Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.

“But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”

“We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.

“And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.

“She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained the Scarecrow.

“Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man．“Who melted her?”

“It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.

“Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before her.

Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before．Afterward they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City．When the people heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.

The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.

The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made no reply．They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did not．They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next．The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery．So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not．When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o’clock the next morning．He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.

The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had promised to bestow on him．Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again.

Promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz.

Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room．They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.

Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome, and it said:

“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible．Why do you seek me?”

They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy asked,

“Where are you?”

“I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible．I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said:

“We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”

“What promise?” asked Oz.

“You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was destroyed,” said the girl.

“And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.

“And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.

“And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.

“Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, and Dorothy thought it trembled a little.

“Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket of water.”

“Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for I must have time to think it over.”

“You've had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodman angrily.

“We shan't wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.

“You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.

The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner．As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder．For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were．The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out,

“Who are you?”

“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in a trembling voice．“But don't strike me—please don't—and I'll do anything you want me to.”

Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.

“I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.

“And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.

“And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.

“And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.

“No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly．“I have been making believe.”

“Making believe!” cried Dorothy．“Are you not a Great Wizard?”

“Hush, my dear,” he said．“Don't speak so loud, or you will be overheard—and I should be ruined．I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard.”

“And aren't you?” she asked.

“Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man.”

“You're more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; “you're a humbug.”

“Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him．“I am a humbug.”

“But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman．“How shall I ever get my heart?”

“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.

“Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve.

“My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these little things．Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found out.”

“Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?” asked Dorothy.

“No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz．“I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out．It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room．Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.”

“But, I don't understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment．“How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?”

“That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz．“Step this way, please, and I will tell you all about it.”

He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him．He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face.

“This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz．“I stood behind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.”

“But how about the voice?” she inquired.

“Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man．“I can throw the sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of the Head．Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely Lady．And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out．As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling．It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.

“Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug.”

“I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully; “but it was the only thing I could do．Sit down, please, there are plenty of chairs; and I will tell you my story.”

So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.

“I was born in Omaha—”

“Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.

“No, but it's farther from here,” he said, shaking his head at her sadly．“When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very well trained by a great master．I can imitate any kind of a bird or beast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was．“After a time,” continued Oz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”

“What is that?” asked Dorothy.

“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.

“Oh,” she said, “I know.”

“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that I couldn't come down again．It went way up above the clouds, so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away．For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country.

“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit．But I found myself in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I was a great Wizard．Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.

“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well．Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.”

“But isn't everything here green?” asked Dorothy.

“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you．The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now．But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy．I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.

“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do wonderful things．There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West．Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have destroyed me．As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East．When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”

“I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.

“Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad Wizard, I must admit.”

“Can't you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.

“You don't need them．You are learning something every day．A baby has brains, but it doesn't know much．Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get.”

“That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains.”

The false Wizard looked at him carefully.

“Well,” he said with a sigh, “I'm not much of a magician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head with brains．I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find that out for yourself.”

“Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow．“I'll find a way to use them, never fear!”

“But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.

“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz．“All you need is confidence in yourself．There is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger．The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”

“Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,” said the Lion．“I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid.”

“Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” replied Oz.

“How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.

“Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong to want a heart．It makes most people unhappy．If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.”

“That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman．“For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me the heart.”

“Very well,” answered Oz meekly．“Come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart．I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well continue the part a little longer.”

“And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back to Kansas?”

“We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man．“Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to carry you over the desert．In the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish．There is only one thing I ask in return for my help—such as it is．You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a humbug.”

They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their rooms in high spirits．Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and Terrible Humbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.





Chapter 16 The Magic Art of the Great Humbug


Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:

“Congratulate me．I am going to Oz to get my brains at last．When I return I shall be as other men are.”

“I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.

“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied．“But surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.

“Come in,” said Oz.

The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window, engaged in deep thought.

“I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.

“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz．“You must excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place.”

“That's all right,” said the Scarecrow．“You are quite welcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again.”

So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw．Then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles．Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.

When he had fastened the Scarecrow's head on his body again he said to him,

“Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains.”

The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.

Dorothy looked at him curiously．His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains.

“How do you feel?” she asked.

“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly．“When I get used to my brains I shall know everything.”

“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked the Tin Woodman.

“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.

“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman．So he walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.

“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said,

“I have come for my heart.”

“Very well,” answered the little man．“But I shall have to cut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place．I hope it won't hurt you.”

“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman．“I shall not feel it at all.”

So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole in the left side of the Tin Woodman's breast．Then, going to a chest of drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust.

“Isn't it a beauty?” he asked.

“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased．“But is it a kind heart?”

“Oh, very!” answered Oz．He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it had been cut.

“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be proud of．I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't be helped.”

“Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman．“I am very grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”

“Don't speak of it,” replied Oz.

Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune.

The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.

“Come in,” said Oz.

“I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the room.

“Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for you.”

He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved．Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:

“Drink.”

“What is it?” asked the Lion.

“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage．You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it．Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible.”

The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.

“How do you feel now?” asked Oz.

“Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune.

Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted．“How can I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done? It was easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do anything．But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I'm sure I don't know how it can be done.”





Chapter 17 How the Balloon Was Launched


For three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz．These were sad days for the little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented．The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself．When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh．The Lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce Kalidahs.

Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more than ever to get back to Kansas.

On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:

“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this country.”

“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.

“Well, I'm not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I haven't the faintest notion which way it lies．But the first thing to do is to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”

“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.

“Well, I'll tell you what I think,” said the little man．“You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon．You also came through the air, being carried by a cyclone．So I believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air．Now, it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I believe I can make a balloon.”

“How?” asked Dorothy.

“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it．I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be no trouble to make the balloon．But in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with, to make it float.”

“If it won't float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”

“True,” answered Oz．“But there is another way to make it float, which is to fill it with hot air．Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we should be lost.”

“We!” exclaimed the girl．“Are you going with me?”

“Yes, of course,” replied Oz．“I am tired of being such a humbug．If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them．So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome．I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”

“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.

“Thank you,” he answered．“Now, if you will help me sew the silk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”

So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together．First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them．It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long.

Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.

“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said．So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.

When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds．The news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight.

Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity．The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag．Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the ground.

Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:

“I am now going away to make a visit．While I am gone the Scarecrow will rule over you．I command you to obey him as you would me.”

The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.

“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard．“Hurry up, or the balloon will fly away.”

“I can't find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not wish to leave her little dog behind．Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at last found him．She picked him up and ran towards the balloon.

She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her.

“Come back!” she screamed．“I want to go, too!”

“I can't come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket．“Good-bye!”

“Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and farther into the sky.

And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know．But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:

“Oz was always our friend．When he was here he built for us this beautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to rule over us.”

Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and would not be comforted.





Chapter 18 Away to the South


Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon．And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions.

The Tin Woodman came to her and said:

“Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart．I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”

“With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once．Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel．When he had finished, he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap.

The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he was not a Wizard the people were proud of him．“For,” they said, “there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.” And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.

The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met in the Throne Room and talked matters over．The Scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.

“We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palace and the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please．When I remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite satisfied with my lot.”

“I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my new heart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”

“For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that ever lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.

“If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,” continued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”

“But I don't want to live here,” cried Dorothy．“I want to go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”

“Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.

The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains．Finally he said:

“Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the desert?”

“I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully．“It's just the thing．I'll go at once for the Golden Cap.”

When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her.

“This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King, bowing before the little girl．“What do you wish?”

“I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.

But the Monkey King shook his head.

“That cannot be done,” he said．“We belong to this country alone, and cannot leave it．There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet, and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there．We shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert．Good-bye.”

And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through the window, followed by all his band.

Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment.

“I have wasted the charm of the Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeys cannot help me.”

“It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.

The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly that Dorothy feared it would burst.

“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask his advice.”

So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.

“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier, “wishes to cross the desert．How can she do so?”

“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever crossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself.”

“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.

“Glinda might,” he suggested.

“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.

“The Witch of the South．She is the most powerful of all the Witches, and rules over the Quadlings．Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert, so she may know a way to cross it.”

“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?” asked the child.

“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she is kind to everyone．I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”

“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.

“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers．There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country．For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”

The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:

“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her．For, of course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”

“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.

“I have,” said the Scarecrow.

“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again．I am really a wild beast, you know．Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”

“That is true,” agreed the Woodman．“My axe may be of service to her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”

“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.

“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.

“Certainly．If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains．She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the Emerald City．So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”

“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully．“You are all very kind to me．But I should like to start as soon as possible.”

“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow．“So now let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey.”





Chapter 19 Attacked by the Fighting Trees


The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate．When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble．But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them.

“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you must come back to us as soon as possible.”

“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but I must help Dorothy to get home, first.”

As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:

“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me．I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”

“Don't try, my dear,” he answered．“We should like to keep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth and started upon their journey.

The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the South．They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together．Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her．As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies, barking merrily all the time.

“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they walked along at a brisk pace．“I have lost much flesh since I lived there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous I have grown.”

They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City．All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.

“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast.

“He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” said the Scarecrow.

“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the Lion, “he would have been a brave man.”

Dorothy said nothing．Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done his best, so she forgave him．As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a bad Wizard.

The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side．They slept that night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well indeed.

In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood．There was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost．So they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.

The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath．So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.

This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.

“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.

“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn't hurt me to get thrown about.” He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.

“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy．“What shall we do?”

“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our journey,” remarked the Lion.

“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so roughly．When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two．At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.

“Come on!” he shouted to the others．“Be quick!” They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled．But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.

The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.

The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood．Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china．It was smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.

“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.

“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must climb over the wall.”





Chapter 20 The Dainty China Country


While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk．The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.

The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:

“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”

“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the Woodman．“When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side.”

After a time the ladder was finished．It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose．The Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready．The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off．When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said,

“Oh, my!”

“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.

So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried,

“Oh, my!” just as the Scarecrow had done.

Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him be still.

The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of them cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall．When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight.

Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter．Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors．These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy's waist．There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.

But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country．There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffied gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps．And, strangest of all, these people were all made of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than Dorothy's knee.

No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.

“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.

They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet．Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet．When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.

“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,” said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due South.”

They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow．As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter.

Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.

“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily．“See what you have done! My cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have it glued on again．What do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow?”

“I'm very sorry,” returned Dorothy．“Please forgive us.”

But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer．She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs．As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.

Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.

“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”

A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away.

Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her．But the china girl cried out:

“Don't chase me! Don't chase me!”

She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,

“Why not?”

“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away, “if I run I may fall down and break myself.”

“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.

“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,” replied the Princess.

“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.

“Now there is Mr．Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china lady, “who is always trying to stand upon his head．He has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all pretty．Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”

Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.

The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:

“My lady fair,

Why do you stare

At poor old Mr．Joker?

You're quite as stiff

And prim as if

You'd eaten up a poker!”

“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess．“Can't you see these are strangers, and should be treated with respect?”

“Well, that's respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately stood upon his head.

“Don't mind Mr．Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy．“He is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.”

“Oh, I don't mind him a bit,” said Dorothy．“But you are so beautiful,” she continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly．Won't you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could carry you in my basket.”

“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess．“You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please．But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty．Of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country.”

“I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimed Dorothy．“So I'll just say good-bye.”

“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.

They walked carefully through the china country．The little animals and all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall.

It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion's back they all managed to scramble to the top．Then the Lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces.

“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow's leg and a church．They are all so brittle!”

“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged．There are worse things in the world than being a Scarecrow.”





Chapter 21 The Lion Becomes the King of Beasts


After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass．It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight．However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground．But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen.

“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking around him with joy．“Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”

“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.

“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion．“I should like to live here all my life．See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees．Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home.”

“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.

“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them about.”

They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther．Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.

When morning came, they started again．Before they had gone far they heard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals．Toto whimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety．There were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid．But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.

As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic．The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion and bowed, saying:

“Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”

“What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.

“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest．It is a most tremendous monster, like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk．It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly．Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.”

The Lion thought for a moment.

“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.

“No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all．And, besides, they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”

“If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as King of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.

“We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: “We will!”

“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.

“Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his forefoot.

“Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion, “and I will go at once to fight the monster.”

He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy.

The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust．Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair．It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp's waist．This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster's back．Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider's head from its body．Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead.

The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly:

“You need fear your enemy no longer.”

Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.





Chapter 22 The Country of the Quadlings


The four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock.

“That will be a hard climb,” said the Scarecrow, “but we must get over the hill, nevertheless.”

So he led the way and the others followed．They had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out,

“Keep back!”

“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.

Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said,

“This hill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to cross it.”

“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow．“We're going to the country of the Quadlings.”

“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.

He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles．But he had no arms at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill．So he said,

“I'm sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not,” and he walked boldly forward.

As quick as lightning the man's head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the hill．Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as he said,

“It isn't as easy as you think!”

A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock.

The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow's mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up the hill.

Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.

Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion came up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said,

“It is useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand them.”

“What can we do, then?” she asked.

“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman．“You have still the right to command them once more.”

“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered the magic words．The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few moments the entire band stood before her.

“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.

“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered the girl.

“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them．As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the Quadlings.

“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to Dorothy; “so good-bye and good luck to you.”

“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the Monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.

The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy．There was field upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them．The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins．The Quadlings themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.

The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door．It was opened by the farmer's wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk for Toto.

“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.

“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer's wife．“Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.”

Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle．Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached, one of them said to her:

“Why have you come to the South Country?”

“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered．“Will you take me to her?”

“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.” They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle．After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once.





Chapter 23 The Good Witch Grants Dorothy's Wish


Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints.

When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.

She was both beautiful and young to their eyes．Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders．Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.

“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.

Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures they had met with.

“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”

Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little girl.

“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way to get back to Kansas.”

Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me the Golden Cap.”

“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.”

“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,” answered Glinda, smiling.

Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow,

“What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”

“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has made me its ruler and the people like me．The only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”

“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”

“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.

“You are unusual,” replied Glinda.

Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked,

“What will become of you when Dorothy leaves this country?”

He leaned on his axe and thought a moment．Then he said, “The Winkies were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch died．I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever.”

“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “will be that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies．Your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will rule the Winkies wisely and well.”

Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked,

“When Dorothy has returned to her own home, what will become of you?”

“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a grand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King．If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily there.”

“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall be to carry you to your forest．Then, having used up the powers of the Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore.”

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:

“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet told me how to get back to Kansas.”

“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda．“If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the very first day you came to this country.”

“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the Scarecrow．“I might have passed my whole life in the farmer's cornfield.”

“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman．“I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.”

“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion, “and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.”

“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use to these good friends．But now that each of them has had what he most desired, and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like to go back to Kansas.”

“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers．And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the wink of an eye．All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.”

“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to carry me back to Kansas at once.”

She threw her arms around the Lion's neck and kissed him, patting his big head tenderly．Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints．But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades.

Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself.

Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying:

“Take me home to Aunt Em!”




Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.

The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.

At length, however, she sat up and looked about her.

“Good gracious!” she cried.

For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one．Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously.

Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet．For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.





Chapter 24 Home Again


Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her.

“My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses．“Where in the world did you come from?”

“From the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy gravely．“And here is Toto, too．And oh, Aunt Em! I'm so glad to be at home again!”
