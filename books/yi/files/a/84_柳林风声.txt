译　序


这本童话书是我在2011年春翻译的，此前我只在1997年译过另一本童话书：《水孩子》。在众多经典童话中我选择这两本书是出于同一个原因：它们是那么的美。美丽的故事，美好的情感，诗意的叙述。不同的是，译《水孩子》是为了我自己早年对它的爱，译这本书一开始却是为了朋友和读者的愿望。

大约五年前，先后有几位好友，其中包括两位编辑朋友，表示希望我翻译《柳林风声》。我说：此书已经有了好几个中译本，我再重译是否多余？他们说：《柳林风声》的文字生动美丽，连美国总统罗斯福（二十世纪美国出过两位罗斯福总统，二战时的罗斯福总统是第二位，这里说的是第一位）也非常着迷，他甚至写信告诉作者说自己一口气读了三遍；但是，已有的中译本似乎不太理想，并没有那样的魅力。朋友们希望我抽点空，锤打一个更理想的中译本出来。很巧，那段时间我开始写博客，同时早年所译《水孩子》陆续出了多个版本，有几位《水孩子》的大读者找到我的电邮，写信给我，也是希望我重译《柳林风声》。于是，我把这件事放在了心上。

两年前我重新开始翻译童书。自然而然地，《柳林风声》成了首选。





这本书的作者肯尼斯·格雷厄姆（Kenneth Grahame，1859—1932）是英国苏格兰爱丁堡人，他的童年很不幸，五岁丧母，随后丧父，兄弟几个都由亲戚收养，他本人在母亲病逝后即由外公外婆带到乡间抚养。童年生活使他终生喜爱田野风光，热爱大自然。他喜欢研究动物，喜欢写作，但他没钱上大学，从二十岁开始起一直在银行里工作。1908年他被一个闯进银行的疯汉子开枪打伤，提早退休；就在这同一年，他的代表作《柳林风声》出版。

这本书的来由是他的儿子。他四十岁出头才得了一个儿子，非常疼爱。孩子六岁时，他自己编故事讲给他听；孩子听得入了迷，不肯离开他去外地过暑假，他就答应用写信的办法来继续。他履行了对儿子的诺言，而那些信件……是的，那些信后来经过加工，变成了你正在往下看的这本书。





这是一本有趣又甜美温馨的书。

有趣的是书中的动物和他们的冒险经历。他们是胆小老实又喜欢冒险的鼹鼠莫尔，热情好客并有诗人气质的水鼠兰特，虚荣浮夸、追求时尚的癞蛤蟆托德和持重且侠义的獾子班杰，另外，还有一个贪吃而潇洒豪爽的水獭奥特。他们友爱互助，经历了许多奇妙有趣的事情，最后癞蛤蟆托德靠朋友们一道仗义出手，夺回家园，并终于改掉了自己的坏毛病。

甜美温馨的是书的主题和情调：家园和友情。无论是奢华的家（癞蛤蟆托德的家）还是简朴的家（鼹鼠莫尔的家），无论是规模宏大的家（獾子班杰的家）还是温馨整洁的小家（水鼠兰特的家），都是动物们各自珍爱的；那一带的河岸和树林是他们共同的家园。他们互相探访，结伴同游，生活充满情趣。鼹鼠莫尔同水鼠兰特相依相伴的友情，獾子班杰兄长般的友爱与呵护，他们仨对癞蛤蟆托德的关爱，构成了整个故事的基调。

如果你喜爱大自然，那你就更应该读这本书了。在肯尼斯·格雷厄姆的笔下，田野、河流、道路、树木……是那么的美丽、充满诗意。季节的变化触动心弦，寻找小水獭的整个过程像美梦一样令人迷醉。燕子们对南方的描述，航海鼠对远方大海和港湾的描述，是那么令人向往……

那么美的笔触在叙述癞蛤蟆托德的荒唐冒险时，又带着一种轻轻的嘲讽，使他显得既滑稽又可爱。甚至在描述水鼠兰特的诗意的感伤时，也略带一丝调侃。这又使全书显得非常轻松活泼。





文字本身是那么的生动，那些句子是那么的精致，使我这个译者感觉到，这本给孩子读的书的难译程度甚至不亚于诗歌。但是翻译过程中我感觉到的只有愉悦，因为我发现自己渐渐地也爱上了它。一本真正好的童话书，对孩子和大人来说都是很有吸引力的，《柳林风声》正是这样一本书。希望它没有被我糟蹋了，希望这个译本没有让我的朋友们，还有你──亲爱的小读者或者大读者──感到失望。





杨柳风，春天的风。

2013年春于奉贤海湾





第一章　河岸


整个早晨，鼹鼠莫尔都在十分努力地工作，给他的小家做春季大清扫。先扫地，再掸灰，然后踩着梯子、台阶和椅子，用石灰水刷墙。最后弄得眼睛和喉咙里都是灰土，一身黑皮毛上溅满了石灰水的白点子，胳膊酸疼，腰酸背痛。而他头顶上的空气、脚下的泥土，他的周围，都洋溢着春天的气息；连他那昏暗低矮的小房子，都透进了春天的无比美妙的渴望氛围。所以呀，他突然发飙就没什么可奇怪的了：他把刷子扔在地板上。“讨厌，”他说，“啊，见鬼！”还加上一句：“去他的春季大清扫！”说完外套都没披上，就冲出了家门。上面有什么东西在急切地召唤着他。他沿着陡峭而狭窄的通道向上爬去。对他来说，这通道就相当于那些住宅离太阳和天空更近的动物所拥有的铺石子儿的马车道。他一边忙着用小爪子扒呀、挖呀、抓呀、抠呀，一边自言自语地咕哝着：“我们上去喽！我们上去喽！”终于，噗！大鼻子钻进了阳光里，他发现自己在一片大草甸上，在温暖的草上打滚。

“真棒！”他说，“这可比石灰水好多了！”阳光洒在他的皮毛上，暖洋洋的；柔和的微风抚摸着他晒热的额头。在与世隔绝的地洞里住了那么久，听觉也迟钝了，小鸟快乐的鸣唱一下子灌进耳朵，差不多就像是吼叫。他立刻弹起四条腿，在生活的欢乐中，在春天的喜悦里，把春季大清扫抛到脑后，蹿过大草坪，来到它另一边的树篱前。

“站住！”树篱豁口处，一只上了年纪的兔子喝道，“此路私人所有，留下六便士买路钱！”顷刻间，他就被很不耐烦的莫尔轻蔑地撞翻了。别的兔子急忙从洞口向外窥望，想看看外面究竟在闹腾什么。莫尔沿着树篱内侧一溜小跑，耍弄他们寻开心。“洋葱酱！洋葱酱！”他嘲弄地说。他们还没来得及想出一句十分满意的话来回敬他，他已经跑得没了影。于是他们像惯常那样，一个个互相埋怨起来。“瞧你多笨！你干吗不告诉他……”“哟，你为什么不说……”“你原本可以提醒他……”等等；不过当然啰，这些都是事后聪明，他们照例总是这一套的。

一切都太美好了，仿佛不是真的一样。他很起劲儿地在草地上东跑西颠，沿着灌木丛，翻过坡顶，发现处处小鸟在筑巢，花儿绽开苞蕾，叶子抽出嫩芽──万物都很快乐，都在成长，都没有空闲。可并没有愧疚感因此来刺他，对他嘀咕“石灰水！”不知为什么，他只感觉到，在这一大群忙碌的居民中间，做唯一的一只懒狗狗，有多么快活。说到底，休假这事最好的地方，也许还不是自己在休息，而是看到别的家伙都在忙着干活儿。

他漫无目的地东游西逛，突然在河边停住了脚步：一条盈满水的河。这时他觉得自己幸福到极点了。他生平还从来没见过河──这个光滑、弯曲、身躯庞大的动物，追逐着、轻轻地笑着，抓住什么东西就汩汩地笑，又哗哗大笑着把它们放开，扑向前去抓新的玩伴，它们晃动着挣脱了，又被它追上来抓住。它浑身颤动，亮晶晶，闪着粼粼、熠熠、烁烁的光；它打着漩儿，翻着泡泡，沙沙地响着，不停地唠叨着。鼹鼠莫尔痴了，迷了，着魔了。他沿着河边一路小跑，就像一个小孩子听大人讲动听的故事着了迷，小跑着紧跟在大人左右一样。他终于跑累了，在河岸上坐下来，而河流依然在不停地对他唠叨着；世上最好听的故事，潺潺地鱼贯而来，发自地心深处，最终要去向那永不知足的大海倾诉。

他正坐在那里向河对岸张望，一个黑乎乎的洞吸引住了他的目光。它在对面的河堤上，离水面只有一点点。他像在梦中一样迷迷糊糊地想：对于一个要求不高、又喜欢小巧玲珑的河边住宅的动物来说，那是个多么温暖舒适的住所呀，河水泛滥时淹不到，又远离尘嚣。他正盯着看，忽然，在洞中央，一个亮晶晶的小东西好像闪了一下，很快就消失了，然后又像一颗小星星一样闪了一下。但星星是不会出现在这样一个地方的，要说是萤火虫吧，又太亮太小了。他正望着呢，它冲着他眨了一下，这就宣告了它是一只眼睛。渐渐地，一张小脸在它周围显现出来，就像画儿的周围显现出画框一样。

一张长着胡须的棕色小脸。

圆脸很严肃，眼睛闪着光──就是一开始吸引他注意的那种亮光。

小巧玲珑的耳朵，丝绸一样的浓密毛发。

是水鼠兰特！

于是，两只动物站在那里，谨慎地互相打量着。

“嗨，莫尔！”水鼠兰特说。

“嗨，兰特！”鼹鼠莫尔说。

“你想过来吗？”水鼠兰特就问。

“唉，说说倒是挺容易的呢。”鼹鼠莫尔说。他有点生气，因为自己是第一次见识河流，对于河边的生活方式很陌生。

水鼠兰特什么也没有说，弯下身子，解开一条绳索，往里拽，然后轻轻地跨上鼹鼠莫尔先前没注意到的一条小船。船的外壳漆成蓝色，内侧漆成白色，大小正好能容下两只动物。鼹鼠莫尔的整个心立刻飞到了船上，尽管他还没有完全明白它的用处。

水鼠兰特敏捷地把船划过来，停稳了，然后伸出前爪，搀着战战兢兢的鼹鼠莫尔迈步往下走。“扶好了！”他说，“现在，动作快些跨上来！”鼹鼠莫尔又惊又喜地发现，自己千真万确坐在了一条真船的船尾。

“今天真是太美妙了！”他说，这时水鼠兰特一撑，让船离开河岸，又重新拿起了桨，“你知道吗，这一辈子我还从来没坐过船呢。”

“什么？”水鼠兰特吃惊地张大了嘴，叫道，“从来没坐过──你从来没有──哦哟哟──那你一直在做些什么哟？”

“坐船真那么美吗？”鼹鼠莫尔不好意思地问。其实，他早就已经愿意相信这一点了：在他的背刚靠上座位后背，试试靠垫的时候；在他打量着船桨、桨架和所有迷人的装备，开始感觉到船在身子底下轻轻摇晃的时候。

“美？这可是世上独一无二的哟。”水鼠庄严地说，“相信我，朋友，坐着船就那么闲逛，是最有价值的事。没有第二件事抵得上它的一半，绝对没有。就那么闲逛。”他继续像做梦一样地说着：“坐──着──船──闲──逛──，坐着──”

“看着前面，兰特！”鼹鼠莫尔突然嚷道。

太迟了。全速行驶的小船撞在河岸上。那梦中人，那快乐的桨手，四爪朝天躺在了船底。

“——船——或跟着船——闲逛，”水鼠兰特快活地大笑一声，一个翻身坐了起来，从容地接着说下去，“待在船里面还是外面，无所谓。好像无论怎样都没什么大不了，魅力就在这里呀。出发，还是不走；到达目的地，还是到达别的地方，还是哪里都不去，你都一直在忙着，从来不专门去做一件事。做完一件事，总是会有别的事可以做，喜欢就可以去做，不过，没什么喜欢就不做最好。听我说！今天上午你要是手头没什么大不了的事，我们就一起顺流而下，逛上它一整天，好不好？”

鼹鼠莫尔十分幸福地来回晃动着脚趾，十分满意地叹出一口气，舒展了一下胸口，快乐透顶地往后一靠，陷在柔软的垫子里。“今天我要开心死了！”他说，“立刻出发！”

“那好，稍等一分钟！”水鼠兰特说。他把缆绳穿进小栈桥上的一个圆环里，爬上去走进洞，只一会儿就蹒跚着又出来了，头上顶着一个胖大的、藤条编的午餐篮子。

“把它丢在你脚边。”他把篮子递上船，看着鼹鼠莫尔，说道。然后，他解开缆绳，重新操起了桨。

“篮子里是什么呢？”鼹鼠莫尔好奇地扭动着身子，问道。

“里面有冷鸡肉，”水鼠兰特报起了菜名，“冷舌头冷火腿冷牛肉腌小黄瓜沙拉法式面包卷水芹菜三明治罐装肉姜汁啤酒柠檬汁苏打水……”

“哇，打住，打住，”鼹鼠莫尔欣喜若狂地嚷道，“太多了！”

“你真的认为太多？”水鼠兰特认真地问，“这只是我平时这样小小出游一下时带的东西，别的动物还老说我小气呢，说我太抠门儿！”

这些话鼹鼠莫尔一个字也没听进去。他沉浸在刚刚投入的新生活里，陶醉在波光、涟漪、芳香、水声和阳光中。他把一只爪子伸进水里，做着悠长的白日梦。水鼠本是个好心肠的小家伙，稳稳当当地划着船，忍着不去打扰他。

“你的衣服我喜欢得要命，老伙计，”大约半小时后，他评论说，“哪一天有了钱，我要给自己弄一套黑丝绒吸烟装。”

“对不起，”鼹鼠莫尔好不容易回过神来，说道，“你一定觉得我没礼貌，但是这一切对我来说太新鲜了。这样看来──这──就是一条──河！”

“这就是那条河。”水鼠兰特纠正道。

“你真的住河边？多快乐的生活啊！”

“住河边，靠河过日子，水上漂，水里游，”水鼠兰特说，“对我来说，它就是兄弟姐妹，姑姑姨姨，朋友伙伴，吃的喝的，天然浴盆。它是我的整个世界，别的无论什么世界我都不要。凡是它没有的，都不值得去要；凡是它不了解的，都不值得去想。主啊！我们一起度过的时光多么美好！春夏秋冬一年四季，它都富有情趣，都有让人兴奋的地方。二月里，洪水来了，我的地窖里灌满了喝了没好处的饮料，黄褐色的水在我最好的卧室窗户旁边奔流；水落下去以后，露出一块块气味像葡萄干蛋糕一样的泥巴，灯芯草之类的杂草堵塞了通道，那时我就可以在大部分河床上到处逛逛而不弄湿鞋子了，还能找到新鲜的食物吃，捡到粗心大意的人从船上掉下来的东西！”

“不过，会不会有时也有点无聊啊？”鼹鼠莫尔大着胆子问，“只有你和河，没有别人可以说个话什么的？”

“你说没有别人？──嗨，我可不能对你要求太高喽，”水鼠兰特宽宏大量地说，“你刚认识河，当然不会了解。如今河岸上太拥挤，许多人就都一块儿搬家了。不是的哦，往常的光景根本不是这样的。水獭呀，翠鸟呀，小鸊鷉呀，黑水鸡呀，全都整天没完没了地要你干这干那──好像别人自己没事情要打理似的！”

“那边是什么？”鼹鼠莫尔挥了挥爪子，指着大河一侧的远处问，一片围着草地的黑幽幽的树林。

“那个？哦，那就是野树林，”水鼠兰特简短地说，“我们很少去那里，我们河边居民。”

“他们──住在那边的不是正派人？”鼹鼠莫尔问，有一点紧张。

“嗯……”水鼠兰特答道，“让我想想。松鼠是好人。兔子嘛──有的还好，但是兔子有好有坏。当然，还有獾子班杰。他就住在树林正中央，别处哪里也不肯住，你出钱请他也不去。亲爱的老班杰！没人招惹他。他们最好别招惹他。”他意味深长地加上一句。

“哟，谁会招惹他？”鼹鼠莫尔问。

“嗯，当然……还……住着些别的人，”水鼠兰特解释说，有点吞吞吐吐，“黄鼠狼，白鼬，狐狸什么的。要说呢，他们也不坏……我同他们是很好的朋友，遇上了就一起打发掉一点时间，玩玩……但他们有时会胡来，这个不用否认，还有，嗯，不能真的相信他们，这也是事实。”

鼹鼠莫尔很清楚，老是谈论可能会遇到的麻烦，哪怕不明说只是暗示，都不合动物的礼节。所以，他抛开了这个话题。

“野树林再过去是什么地方呢？”他问，“就是那个一片蓝，模模糊糊，看上去像山又可能不是山的东西，像是镇子里的炊烟，也许只是一片浮云？”

“野树林那边是广阔世界，”水鼠兰特说，“那地方跟你我没什么关系。我从没去过，也永远不会去。如果你头脑没有完全发昏，也不要去。请别再提它了。好啦！终于到回水河汊了，我们开饭。”

离开主河道后，他们驶进了一片美丽的水面。初看上去它像陆地环抱的一个小湖：绿茸茸的草皮从每一面坡岸上披垂到水边，蛇一样的褐色树根在幽静的水面下泛着光，而他们前方是一道拦河坝的银色肩胛，河水泛着泡沫在坝下翻滚。与水坝挽手并肩的，是一个永不休止地滴着水的水车轮，它不停地转动着，带动一座有灰色山墙的磨坊，使空中充满了催眠般的咕哝声，沉闷得让人透不过气来，但磨坊里面却隔一会儿传出一阵轻轻的说话声，清脆而欢快。真是太美了，鼹鼠莫尔不由得举起两只前爪，喘息着说：“哦，天！哦，天！哦，天！”

水鼠兰特把船划到岸边，靠稳了，帮助仍然笨手笨脚的莫尔安全地上了岸，然后把午餐篮甩上去。

鼹鼠莫尔请求恩准他独自打开篮子，水鼠兰特很高兴地批准了。他自己伸开四爪躺在草地上休息，听凭兴奋不已的朋友抖开桌布铺好，把篮子里的神秘小包一个个取出来，解开后一样一样依次摆好。莫尔依然在喘息着，每揭开一个新秘密都叫一声：“哦，天！哦，天！”一切准备就绪后，水鼠兰特说道：“现在开饭。使劲儿吃吧，老伙计！”这样一个吩咐，鼹鼠莫尔可真乐意听从哟。因为当天一大早，他就按习俗开始春季大清扫，没有停下来吃喝过一点点东西；后来他又经历了许多事，但都仿佛跟现在隔了好远，过了好多天似的。

“你在看什么呢？”水鼠兰特就说。这时，他们饥饿难耐的感觉已经多少缓解了一些了，鼹鼠莫尔的眼睛已经能够稍微离开桌布，看看别的地方。

“我在看一串气泡，”鼹鼠莫尔说，“我看见它们在水面上移动，觉得挺好玩儿。”

“水泡？啊哈！”话音刚落，水鼠兰特就开始快活地叭叽嘴，那样子像是在馋什么人。

紧靠岸边的水面上，露出一张闪光的大嘴巴，水獭奥特把身子伸上来，抖掉外套上的水。

“贪吃的叫花子！”他评论道，一边向食物凑过来，“怎么不邀请我呀，鼠仔？”

“这是个临时聚餐，”水鼠兰特解释说，“顺便介绍一下，我朋友莫尔先生。”

“实在很荣幸。”水獭奥特说，两只动物立刻成了朋友。

“到处都是这样吵闹！”水獭奥特接着说道，“今天好像全世界的人都跑出家门，到水上来了。我来到这回水河汊是图个片刻清静，却没想到碰上你们两个家伙！至少──对不起──我不是这个意思，你们知道的。”

后面窸窣一阵响。声音是从一片树篱中间发出来的，那边依然厚厚地积着去年的落叶。一个斑纹脑袋，架在两只高耸的肩膀前面，从落叶上向这边窥望。

“过来，老班杰！”水鼠兰特叫道。

獾子班杰向前小跑了一两步，然后哼了一声：“呣，伙伴们！”就背过身去，从视野中消失了。

“他就是那么一个家伙！”水鼠兰特很失望评论说，“就是讨厌社交！今天我们不会再看到他了。嗳，告诉我们，河上还有些什么人？”

“托德就是一个，他出来了，”水獭奥特答道，“驾着他那条崭新的赛艇，穿着新运动衣，什么都是新的！”

两只动物相视大笑。

“有一阵子，他只迷帆船，”水鼠兰特说，“后来腻歪了，就玩撑船。什么都不喜欢，成天地玩撑船，天天玩，惹了不少乱子。去年改玩房船，我们大家只好跟着他在房船里待着，并且假装很喜欢。他准备下半辈子就在房船里过。无论他玩什么，每回都一样，旧的腻了，又开始玩新的。”

“他这种人倒也是好人，”水獭奥特若有所思地评论道，“可就是没常性，特别是在船上！”

从他们坐着的地方，目光可以越过中间隔着的小岛，瞥见主河道。就在这时候，一只赛艇刷地映入了眼帘，那个桨手──一个又矮又胖的身影──在艇中前后滚动着，搅得水花四溅，可是他已经是划得不能再卖力了。水鼠兰特站起身来向他打招呼，但是癞蛤蟆托德，没错正是他，他摇摇头，坚定不移地继续划他的船。

“如果他老这样前后滚动，一分钟就会从船里滚出来。”水鼠兰特坐下来，说道。

“肯定的，”水獭奥特咯咯地笑道，“我有没有给你讲过那件好玩的事，就是托德和运河水闸管理员的故事？事情是这样的。托德……”

一只迷路的蜉蝣逆水而来，忽东忽西地改变着方向，那副喝醉了的样子，正是血气方刚、对生活无知无畏的蜉蝣才有的。水上起了一个漩涡，噗哧一声，蜉蝣没影了。

水獭奥特也没影了。

鼹鼠莫尔望过去。奥特的声音犹在耳边，可他趴过的那片草皮上却明明白白已是空空如也。一直望到天边，也不见一只水獭。

但是河面上又起了一串水泡。

水鼠兰特哼起了小曲儿。鼹鼠莫尔想起来了，动物界有个规矩：朋友任何时候突然消失，无论是什么原因，或者根本没有原因，都是不许评论的。

“嗨，嗨，”水鼠兰特说，“我觉得我们该挪挪地方了。不知道我们俩谁来收拾午餐篮比较好？”听他的口气，他好像并不非常渴望得到这个差事。

“哦，我来吧。”鼹鼠莫尔说。既然如此，水鼠兰特当然就让他来了。

收拾午餐篮这件事，是比不上打开它那样令人愉快的。从来都是这样。可鼹鼠莫尔能专心享受每一件事。他刚收拾好，用带子把篮子系紧，又看见一只盘子在草地上瞪着他；他刚把篮子打开再系好，水鼠兰特又指给他看一只任何人都不会看不见的叉子。最最最后，瞧！还有那只他一直坐在上面却毫无知觉的芥末瓶──不过，这件事终于还是完成了，并不让他感到非常生气。

下午的太阳已经在往下沉了，水鼠兰特像做梦一样往回家的方向轻轻地划着船，一边还自顾自地咕哝着什么诗，不怎么理会莫尔。可鼹鼠莫尔午餐吃得饱饱的，心满意足，坐船已经十分在行（他自己这么认为），而且还有点坐不住了，他就说：“鼠仔！我想划划船好吗，现在！”

水鼠兰特微笑着摇摇头。“现在还不行，我年轻的朋友，”他说，“等你训练过几回再说吧。这事不像看起来那么容易。”

鼹鼠莫尔安静了一两分钟，但他心里越来越羡慕兰特。看人家一直划得那么有力，那么轻而易举，他的自尊心开始嘀咕着，他能划得一样好。他跳起来，一把抓住桨。水鼠兰特正出神地望着远处的水面，嘴巴里依然在自言自语地念诗，这突然的一下子吓了他一大跳，一个后仰从座位上摔下来，第二次四爪朝天。这时得胜的莫尔占了他的位置，信心十足地把桨攥在手里。

“住手，你这头蠢驴！”水鼠兰特躺在船底嚷道，“你干不了！你会把船弄翻的！”

鼹鼠莫尔动作有些夸张地把双桨向后一挥，深深地插进水里。他一点都没有划到水面，两条腿一下子甩到空中，整个身子压在躺着的兰特身上。他慌了神，一把抓住船沿，说时迟那时快──噗通！

船翻了，他发现自己在河水中挣扎。

哦，天，水多冷啊，哇，感觉湿得要命。他往下沉，沉，沉，水在耳朵里唱的那是什么歌呀！他浮上水面了，咳着呛着扑腾得水花四溅，这时的太阳多么明亮可亲啊！他感觉到自己又在往下沉，这时他心里一片漆黑，多么绝望哟！接着，一只强有力的爪子抓住了他的脖梗子。──是水鼠兰特，他显然在笑──鼹鼠莫尔能感觉到他在笑，那笑从他的胳膊传下来，通过爪子，传到了他──鼹鼠莫尔的脖子上。

水鼠兰特抓住一支桨，把它塞到鼹鼠莫尔胳膊下面，然后把另一支桨塞到他另一只胳膊下面，自己在后面游着。他把那无助的动物推向岸边，捞出水，在岸上安置好，嚯，那就是一个水淋淋、软塌塌、惨兮兮的包包。

水鼠兰特把他的身子揉搓了一遍，挤掉一些水，然后说道：“得啦，老伙计！现在沿着纤路[1]来回跑，使足了劲儿跑，直到身上干了暖和了为止，我要下水去捞午餐篮了。”

那凄凄惨惨的莫尔，身上透湿，心里面羞愧，开始跑起来，身上差不多干了才停下。这段时间水鼠兰特重新又扎回到水里，把船找回来，翻正，拴牢，把漂浮在水面上的杂物渐渐捞回到岸上，最后潜下水去，找到午餐篮，带着它吃力地上了岸。

一切准备就绪，可以重新出发了。鼹鼠莫尔垂头丧气、一瘸一拐地到船尾坐了下来。开船时，他控制不住激动的情绪，声音低低地说：“鼠仔，我宽宏大量的朋友！真的非常对不起，我的行为太愚蠢、太不知好歹了。刚才想着我可能把漂亮的午餐篮弄丢了，我十分灰心。我知道，我真就是一头十足的蠢驴。你能不能不计前嫌，原谅我，让我们还像以前一样吗？”

“没问题的，上帝保佑你！”水鼠兰特爽快地答应，“沾一点点水，对一只水鼠来说算什么？多数日子，我待在水里的时间比不在水里的时间还要长。别再想它了，听我说！我真的觉得，你最好过来，和我一起待一段时间。我的家很普通很简陋，根本没法和托德家相比，但你还没有去过呢，再怎样我还是能让你住得很舒服的。我可以教你划船、游泳，很快你就会同我们一样，在水上行动自如。”

他这一番厚道诚挚的话，让鼹鼠莫尔感动得说不出话来，只好用爪子背去擦脸上的一两滴泪。水鼠兰特懂得体谅人，眼睛看着别处。鼹鼠莫尔的心情很快就好转了，当两只黑水鸡窃笑着议论他那副狼狈相时，他居然已经能直截了当地回敬他们。

回到家后，水鼠兰特在客厅里生了一炉旺火，在炉子前面摆上一把扶手椅，把鼹鼠莫尔安置在椅子里，替他拿来晨衣和拖鞋，给他讲河上的故事，一直到吃晚饭。对莫尔这样一个住在土里的动物来说，那些故事听起来也是非常惊险有趣的。故事说到了拦河坝、突然暴发的洪水、跳着朝前的狗鱼，还有扔瓶子的汽船──无论如何，确实有瓶子扔下来，而且是从汽船上扔下来的，所以可以推断扔瓶子的就是船。故事里还说到了鹭鸟，他们自以为很了不起；还说到了冒险钻排水沟，同水獭奥特一起夜里捕鱼，跟獾子班杰一块儿去田野里远足。晚饭吃得开心极了，但是饭后不久莫尔就犯困，殷勤的主人只好护送他上楼，进了最好的那间卧室。他的脑袋很快就搁在枕头上，心里面安宁极了满足极了，因为他知道，他新认识的朋友，大河，在轻轻拍打着窗台。

对解放了的鼹鼠莫尔来说，那一天只是许许多多同样美好的好日子的开端。那些日子充满了情趣，并且白昼一天比一天长，因为，丰润成熟的夏天正在到来。莫尔学会了游泳和划船，真正体会到了流水做伴的乐趣。他把耳朵凑近芦苇秆去听，已经间或能听懂风在芦苇丛中飘游时不断发出的窃窃私语声了。

第二章　大路朝天


一个明媚的夏日早晨，鼹鼠莫尔突然说道：“鼠仔，我想求你件事，不知行不？”

水鼠兰特坐在河岸上，正在唱一支小曲儿。那歌是他自己编的，所以他唱得很投入，对莫尔和别的事就不够关心了。话得从那天一大早说起，他和鸭子朋友们一起在河里游泳。鸭子总是喜欢突然来个倒立，他就趁他们这样做的时候，潜下水去，在他们脖子上挠痒痒，就挠在他们的下巴下面，如果说鸭子有下巴的话。鸭子们只好急急忙忙重新浮上水面，冲着他扑打翅膀，气急败坏地嚷嚷。因为你的脑袋要是在水底下，你是不可能把自己的感受痛痛快快说出来的。最后他们乞求他走开，去干自个儿的事，不要再骚扰他们。于是水鼠兰特走开了，他坐在河岸上晒太阳，编了一首鸭子歌，歌名叫做：





鸭　谣

沿着回水河汊，

在高高的灯芯草中间，

看那戏水群鸭，

全都尾巴朝天！





母鸭公鸭尾巴，

还抖动着黄黄的脚丫，

黄黄鸭嘴皆不见，

全都忙活在水下！





绿水草沾着泥浆，

鳊鱼儿在里面游荡，

好一个食物橱哟，

又冷又暗却丰富。





人都各有所爱！

我们有自己的偏爱：

头朝下尾巴朝上，

戏水自由自在！





蓝天在上高高，

雨燕儿盘旋呼叫──

我们在下面戏水，

尾巴齐齐高翘！





“我真说不上非常非常欣赏这首小曲儿，兰特。”鼹鼠莫尔小心翼翼地评论道。他自己不是诗人，也不在乎让别人知道这一点，而且他生性直率。

“鸭子们也说不上喜欢的，”水鼠兰特爽快地答道，“他们会说：‘干吗不让人家在高兴的时候按他们高兴的方式做他们高兴做的事，旁人却要坐在岸上一直看着他们评头品足，做诗来编排他们？全是胡说八道！’这就是鸭子们会说的话。”

“那就是了，那就是了。”鼹鼠莫尔诚心诚意地说。

“不是，不是胡说八道！”水鼠兰特气呼呼地嚷道。

“嗯，那就不是，不是，”鼹鼠莫尔宽慰他说，“可我想问你的是，可不可以带我去拜访托德先生？我听说过他许多事，特别想和他认识一下。”

“嗯，当然可以啦，”和善的兰特说道，他一跃而起，把诗歌从脑袋里解散了，并且那一天再也没有把他们召回，“把船弄出来，我们立刻就划船去他家。什么时间拜访托德都不会不合时宜的。去得早与晚，他都是那副样子。永远是好脾气，你去他总是高兴，你走他总是难过！”

“他一定是个非常好的人。”鼹鼠莫尔评论道。他已经上了船，正拿起桨，而水鼠兰特已经舒舒服服在船尾的座位上坐好了。

“他真是最最好的动物，”兰特答道，“那么单纯，那么和善，那么重感情。也许他不是很聪明──不可能人人都是天才嘛，可能他喜欢吹牛，而且又骄傲自大，但是他有一些了不起的好品质，这蛤蟆仔。”

绕过一个河湾后，他们眼前出现了一座美观庄严的旧红砖老房子，保养得很好的草坪从房子前面一直延伸到水边。

“那就是蛤蟆府，”水鼠兰特说，“左边那个小河湾，就是告示牌上写着‘私人河湾，不准登岸’的，通到他的停船棚屋，我们就在那里下船。马厩在另一边，靠右。你现在看着的那是宴会厅，要说起来的话，年代很久了。你知道的呀，托德相当有钱，这房子确实是附近一带最好的，不过，在托德面前我们从来不这样说。”

他们沿着小河湾向前划行，驶进一个很大的停船棚屋的阴影中，鼹鼠莫尔迅速地收了桨。他们看见里面有很多漂亮的船，有的吊挂在横梁上，有的收放在滑道上，但没有一条在水里。这地方有一种荒废冷落的气氛。

水鼠兰特看看四周。“我明白啦，”他说，“玩船这事结束喽。他已经玩腻了，玩够了。真想知道他如今又在玩什么新花样。来吧，我们去看看他。很快他就会把家底全亮给我们的。”

他们上了岸，穿过点缀着鲜花的草坪，溜达着寻找托德。很快他们就碰上了他，那位老兄正舒舒服服坐在一张藤条花园椅里，满脸专注的神情，膝盖上铺放着一张大地图。

“万岁！”一见他们，他就跳起来，喊道，“好极了！”没等介绍鼹鼠莫尔，他就热情地和他们俩握爪子。“你们能来真是太好了！”他一边接着往下说，一边围着他们跳舞，“我正要派船到下游去接你们，鼠仔，我会严令他们马上接你过来，无论你正在做什么。我极其需要你──你们俩。想用点什么？进去吃点东西吧！你们来得正是时候，你们想不到这有多巧！”

“让我们安安静静坐一会儿吧，蛤蟆仔！”水鼠兰特说着就一屁股坐在一张安乐椅里。鼹鼠莫尔在他旁边一张椅子里坐下，说了几句客气话，称赞托德那“可爱的住宅”。

“整个大河流域最精美的房子，”托德哇啦哇啦地嚷嚷道，“这么好的房子，任何地方也找不到。”他忍不住又加上了一句。

听到这里，水鼠兰特用胳膊肘捅了捅鼹鼠莫尔。很不幸，癞蛤蟆托德看到了这个动作，脸涨得通红。一阵难堪的静寂。接着托德爆发出一阵大笑。“没什么，鼠仔，”他说，“我就是这德行，你知道的啦。这房子并不是那么差，是不？你知道的呀，你自己也相当喜欢它。得啦，我们都切合实际一些。你们正是我需要的动物。你们得帮我。这至关重要！”

“要我猜，是你划船的事吧，”水鼠兰特做出一副愚钝的样子，说道，“你进步挺快，不过还是溅出来不少水花。好好拿出点耐心，再加上些辅导，就可以……”

“哦，呸！划船！”癞蛤蟆托德非常厌恶地打断了他的话，“愚蠢的活动，小孩子玩的。我早就放弃了。没别的，纯粹浪费时间。你们这些家伙本该是明白人，却把所有精力都这样漫无目标地用掉，看到这个我真是痛心透顶。不，我发现了一件真正有意义的事，唯一一件可以做一辈子的正经工作，我打算把余生都奉献给它。过去那么多岁月都浪费了，用在一些无聊的事情上，想到这个我只感到后悔。跟我来，亲爱的鼠仔，还有你这位和蔼的朋友，希望他能赏光。就在马厩场院那边，你们会看到该看一看的东西！”

于是他领路向马厩场院走去，水鼠兰特跟着，脸上是一副表示最最不信任的神情。可是瞧哦，从马车房里拉出来一辆吉卜赛大篷车，只见它簇新锃亮，漆成金丝雀黄，点缀着绿色花饰，车轮是红的。

“就是它！”癞蛤蟆托德叉开腿，挺起肚皮，嚷道，“这辆小车代表的生活，对你们来说，才是真正的生活。野外大道，尘土飞扬的公路，荒野，公地，树篱，起伏的丘陵！野营地，村庄，小镇，城市！今天在这里，明天就动身去别的地方！旅行，改变环境，趣味，刺激！整个世界在你们面前，还有永远在变化的地平线！请注意！在所有已经制造出来的同类型车子里，这一辆是最最精美的，独一无二。进来瞧瞧里面的装备吧。全是我设计的，我本人！”

鼹鼠莫尔兴致勃勃，兴奋极了，紧跟在托德后面跨上阶梯踏板，急切地来到大篷车里边。水鼠兰特只是从鼻子里哼了一声，把两只手猛地插进口袋深处，站在那里一步也没挪动。

里边确实非常紧凑、舒适。几张小卧铺，一张折叠起来靠壁的小桌子，一只做饭的炉子，几只壁式储物柜和书架，一只鸟笼里有一只小鸟，还有各式各样、大大小小的锅碗瓢盆、瓶瓶罐罐。

“一应俱全！”癞蛤蟆托德一边得意扬扬地说，一边拉开一只储物柜，“你看，饼干，罐装龙虾，沙丁鱼，应有尽有。这是苏打水，那是烟草，还有信纸，熏肉，果酱，纸牌和多米诺骨牌──你会发现，”他一边同莫尔一起走下阶梯踏板，一边接着说道，“你会发现，我们今天下午出发时，什么东西也没忘带。”

“对不起，”水鼠兰特嘴里嚼着一根稻草，慢条斯理地说，“我刚才无意中听到你说什么‘我们’、‘出发’、‘今天下午’？”

“哎哟，亲爱的好鼠仔，”托德哀求他说，“别那样冷冰冰不屑一顾地说话行不，你知道的啦，你们不来可不行。没有你们，我是应付不来的。所以就先把这事定下来吧，别争了──我最受不了的一件事就是争论。你总不会打算一辈子黏着那条沉闷的发霉的老河，老守着岸边一个地洞，还有船，就那样过日子吧？我想让你们看看世界！我要把你变成一个真正的动物，伙计！”

“我不稀罕，”水鼠兰特固执地说，“我不去，说不去就不去。我就要黏着我的老河，就要守着地洞和船过日子，我一直那样过，挺好。还有，莫尔会黏着我，我怎样他就怎样，是不是，莫尔？”

“那是当然，”鼹鼠莫尔忠诚地说，“我会一直黏着你的，兰特，你说怎样就怎样，就一定怎样。可是，听起来那样好像……嗳，挺有趣的，是吧！”他眼巴巴地加上了一句。可怜的莫尔！对他来说，冒险生活是多么新鲜、多么刺激的一件事。这件事的新鲜一面，是那么的诱人。这辆金丝雀黄的车子，它的全套小装备，他第一眼看到时就爱上了。

水鼠兰特看出了鼹鼠莫尔的心思，动摇了。他不喜欢让别人失望，他很喜欢鼹鼠莫尔。为了满足莫尔的愿望，差不多让他做什么都行。托德在一旁仔细地观察着他们俩。

“跟我来，进去吃点午饭吧，”他说，展开了外交手段，“我们慢慢商量，什么事都用不着匆忙做决定。当然啦，我并不是真的很在乎。我只不过想让你们两个家伙快活一下。‘为他人活着！’这是我的人生格言。”

蛤蟆府里的一切都很棒，午餐当然也是。吃饭的时候，癞蛤蟆托德只管信口开河。他把水鼠兰特丢在一边，开始在经验不足的莫尔身上做文章，要把文章做得天花乱坠。他天生就是一只口若悬河的动物，又总是沉浸在自己的想象里，这就把旅行的景象、野外生活的欢乐和路途上的情趣，描绘得五彩缤纷，让鼹鼠莫尔激动得在椅子里坐不住。不知不觉中，三个动物很快就说到了一块儿，仿佛出去旅行已经是一件定下来的事。水鼠兰特虽然心里面仍然没有信服，但他的和善还是压倒了他的反对意见。要让两个朋友失望，他可受不了。那两位已经在深入讨论旅行计划，作出许多预想，把未来几个礼拜里每天的活动，都已经设计好了。

大家准备得差不多了，获得最后胜利的托德就领着同伴们来到养马场，指派他们去捉那匹老灰马。托德事先并没有跟老马商量，现在冷不丁就吩咐他在这次尘土弥漫的远足中干最最尘土弥漫的活儿，这让老马恼怒极了。老实说，他情愿待在养马场，所以那两位为了逮他费了不少事。这时托德又往满满的储物柜里硬塞了些生活必需品，把几袋马粮、几网兜洋葱、几捆干草和几只篮子吊在车厢底下。老马最终被逮住，套上了缰绳。车轮刚一转，这些动物就开始说个不停。他们有的跟在车子旁边走，有的坐在车辕上，各随自己的意。这是一个金色的下午。他们扬起的尘土散发出的浓浓气味，让人心旷神怡。从路两边茂密的果园里，小鸟们快活地向他们打招呼，吹口哨。和善的路人从他们身边经过时，对他们说再见，有时也停下来说几句好话，称赞他们的车子漂亮。兔子们坐在灌木树篱里的家门口，举起爪子，嚷嚷着：“哦，天！哦，天！哦，天！”

天快黑的时候，他们已经离开家好远。他们很累，但很快乐。在远离居民区的一块公地上，他们停住了车，松开马缰让灰马去吃草，他们自己坐在车旁的草地上吃了一顿简单的晚饭。托德大谈将来几天他要干的所有事情，这时候呀，他们四周的星星越来越多，越来越大；一轮黄澄澄的月亮，不知从什么地方突然静悄悄地冒了出来，与他们做伴，听他们说话。最后，他们爬进车子，上了各自的小卧铺。托德蹬开四条腿，睡意蒙眬地说：“嗯，晚安，伙计们！这才是真正的绅士生活！说说你的老河吧！”

“我不说我的河，”沉得住气的兰特答道，“你知道我不说的，托德。可我想它，”他动情地低声加上一句，“我想它──老是在想！”

鼹鼠莫尔从毯子下面伸出爪子，在黑暗中摸到水鼠兰特的爪子，捏了一下。“只要你乐意，我怎样都行，鼠仔，”他悄声说，“明天早晨我们溜走，一大早──很早很早──就溜回河边我们亲爱的老洞子里去，好吗？”

“不，不要，我们坚持到底吧，”水鼠兰特悄声答道，“非常感谢，但我应该守着托德，直到这趟旅行结束。丢下他一个人我不放心。不用很久的。他赶时髦从来都长不了。晚安！”

果然很快就结束了，水鼠兰特也没猜到会那么快。

在野外那么久，加上又兴奋，癞蛤蟆托德睡得很死。第二天早晨，无论怎么摇晃，都没法把他从床上叫醒。于是鼹鼠莫尔和兰特不声不响，很男子气地使劲干起活儿来。水鼠兰特照料老马，生火，清洗昨晚的杯盘，准备早餐。鼹鼠莫尔走了很长的路，去距离最近的村子买牛奶鸡蛋和各种必需品，那些东西当然是癞蛤蟆托德忘了带的。繁重的活儿都已经干完，两只动物筋疲力尽，正在休息。这时托德出场了。他精神饱满，心情舒畅，发议论说：如今他们大家过上了轻松愉快的生活，不用再像在家里时那样耗心费神、操劳家务啦。

那一天，他们翻过长满草的丘陵地，沿着狭窄的林荫小岔路，开开心心到处游逛，然后像以前一样，在一块公地上宿营。不过，这一回两位客人用上了心，定要托德干他分内的活儿。结果，第二天早晨动身的时间来到时，托德对这种原始生活一点也不痴迷了，而是一门心思要回到卧铺上去，他可是刚刚才被硬拽起床的呢。像以前一样，他们沿着狭窄的林荫小路，穿过乡间田野，继续他们的旅程。直到差不多下午的时候，他们才上了公路，这是他们第一次上公路。谁也没想到，就在这条路上，飞来一场横祸，落在他们头顶。对他们这次远足来说，那确实是一个大灾祸。而对托德今后的人生旅程来说，那简直就是一件影响力无法抗拒的事。

当时，他们正悠闲自在地在公路上溜达。鼹鼠莫尔走在马头旁边，跟老马说话，因为他抱怨他们完全冷落他，丝毫不理他。癞蛤蟆托德和水鼠兰特走在车子后面，一块儿说说话──至少托德是在说话。兰特只是隔一会儿插上一句：“是啊，一点也不错，你对他说什么来着？”其实他心里面一直在想着毫不相干的事。这时，在他们后面很远的地方，传来警告似的微弱的嗡嗡声，就像一只蜜蜂在远处嗡嗡叫一样。他们回头瞥了一眼，看见一小团尘雾，雾中间一个活的小黑点，正以令人难以置信的速度向他们逼来，同时，尘雾中间有一个微弱的声音在哀号：“噗——噗！”就像一只不安的动物在痛苦地叫唤。他们几乎没当一回事，又回过头来接着说话，可就在这时，刹那间（感觉上好像是这样），和平景象被打破了，一阵狂风，一片喧响，他们的车子就跳起来，翻到路边的沟里了，是它到了跟前！那噗——噗声在他们耳朵里轰鸣震响，有一瞬间，他们瞥到了闪亮的平板玻璃和华贵的摩洛哥羊皮革。那富丽堂皇的汽车，一个脾气暴躁的庞然大物，吓得人喘不过气来。那开车的人神经紧张，使劲儿抓着他的轮子[1]，在那一秒钟里，把整个地、整个天都占了，掀起一团遮天蔽日的尘雾，把他们团团裹住，让他们成了瞎子。接着它又渐渐缩小，变成远处的一个小黑点，变回了一只嗡嗡叫的蜜蜂。

当时，那匹老灰马正一边慢慢向前走，一边梦想着宁静的养马场。突然碰上这样一种没经历过的情形，他就直接情绪失控，被马的天性压倒了。马先是后腿直立，又扬起后蹄奔窜，然后不断地后退。不管鼹鼠莫尔怎样使劲儿拉他的马头，不管鼹鼠莫尔说了多少动听的话来平稳他的情绪，他还是把车子往后推，直奔路旁那道深沟。它摇晃了片刻，然后，一声撕心裂肺的巨响，那辆金丝雀黄的车子，他们的骄傲和欢乐，就侧翻在沟里，成了一堆不可救药的残骸。

水鼠兰特气坏了，一个劲儿地在路上暴跳。“你们这帮流氓！”他挥舞着双拳吼道，“坏蛋，劫匪，你们──你们──你们这帮飙车狂！我要起诉你们！我要告你们！我要把你们一告到底！”他的思乡病一下子就无影无踪了，此时此刻，他成了金丝雀黄大船的船长。对方水手驾船横冲直撞，把他的船逼上了浅滩。他搜肠刮肚，要把那些尖酸刻薄的骂人话全掏出来。过去有些汽艇开得离岸太近，搅起的水浪常常淹了他家客厅的地毯，他就是用那种话来骂那些船长的。

托德直挺挺地坐在满是尘土的路中央，两条腿向前叉开着，两只眼睛直瞪瞪地朝汽车消失的方向望着。他呼吸急促，脸上露出一种温柔而满足的神情，嘴里时不时轻轻地嘟囔一声：“噗——噗！”

鼹鼠莫尔忙着让老马安静下来，过了一会儿，他成功了。然后他走过去看那辆车。它侧翻在沟里，那景象让人看了真伤心。嵌板和窗户都碎了，车轴弯得不可救药，一只轮子掉了，沙丁鱼罐头散落得满世界都是，鸟笼里的小鸟凄凄戚戚地抽泣着，叫人把他放出去。

水鼠兰特过去帮莫尔，但他俩的力气合在一起也没能把车翻正过来。“喂，托德！”他们喊道，“过来帮一把手，行不！”

癞蛤蟆托德没答理一个字，坐在路上一动也不动。他们俩就走过去，看看他到底怎么了。他们发现他神情恍恍惚惚，脸上挂着幸福的笑容，眼睛依然直瞪瞪地望着那毁灭者留下的烟尘。仍然时不时地听到他嘟囔一声：“噗——噗！”

水鼠兰特摇晃着他的肩膀。“你不过来帮帮我们，托德？”他厉声问道。

“多么辉煌、激动人心的景象！”托德喃喃地说着，一点挪窝的意思也没有。“诗一样的运动！真正的旅行方式！唯一的旅行方式！今天在这里，明天就到了下个礼拜才能到的地方！一个个村庄飞逝如电，一座座城镇一晃而过，永远奔向新的地平线！极乐啊！哇，噗——噗！哦，天！哦，天！”

“哦，别再驴了，托德！”鼹鼠莫尔绝望地嚷道。

“想想看，我竟然一无所知！”癞蛤蟆托德继续像做梦一样单调地说着，“那么多岁月被我虚度了，我一无所知，连做梦也没有梦到过！但是现在──但是现在我知道了，现在我完全明白了！啊，从今以后，在我的前方，是一条铺满鲜花的道路！我要疾驰如飞，横冲直撞，在身后扬起一团团尘雾！在我辉煌壮观的进攻之路上，我要毫不在意地把一辆辆马车抛进路沟！极讨厌的小马车──普通马车──金丝雀黄马车！”

“我们拿他怎么办？”鼹鼠莫尔问水鼠兰特。

“什么也不用办，”水鼠兰特很沉着地答道，“因为实在没法办。你要知道，我一千年前就了解他了。他现在是走火入魔了。他又迷上一样新时尚啦，每一回刚开头时，他总是给折腾成这德行。接下来，他会一连好多天这样魔怔，像一只在美梦中游荡的动物，没一点实际的用处。别去管他。我们去看看，马车有没有什么办法弄一下。”

仔细检查一番之后，他们发现，单凭他们俩，即使能够把车子翻正过来，也不能再乘着它旅行了。车轴的状况已是不可救药，脱落的那只轮子也已经成了碎片。

水鼠兰特把缰绳拴在马背上，牵着马头，另一只手提着鸟笼，笼子里那只小鸟已经歇斯底里。“走吧！”他很坚决地对鼹鼠莫尔说，“去最近的镇子也有五六英里，我们只有步行，所以越早动身越好。”

“托德怎么办？”他们俩一起动身时，鼹鼠莫尔焦急地问，“我们不能丢下他，让他一个人这样神经搭错坐在路中央！不安全的。假如再有一个那种东西开过来怎么办？”

“哦，大麻烦托德，”水鼠兰特狠狠心说道，“我和他一刀两断！”

可他们还没走出去多远，身后就响起了啪嗒啪嗒的脚步声，托德追上他们，伸出爪子，一边一个，插进他们的胳膊下面。他仍然呼吸急促，眼睛发直，茫然地看着前方。

“听着，托德！”水鼠兰特厉声说道，“我们一到镇上，你就得直奔警署，弄清楚他们是否知道那辆汽车，它的主人是谁，并且提出控告。然后你得去铁匠铺或修车铺，安排人把车子弄回来修一修，整一整。这要花一点时间，但车子还没有坏到不能修的地步。同时呢，莫尔和我去客栈，找几间舒服的房间住下，等到车子修好，你碰坏的脑子恢复正常再走。”

“警局！控告！”托德像在梦中一样喃喃地说，“要我去控告那个美丽的，那个天堂一样的天赐图景！修马车！我已经永远和马车一刀两断了。我永远不想再见到，也永远不想再听到那辆车。哇，鼠仔！你想不到我多么感谢你同意跟我一块儿出来旅行！没有你做伴，我就不会出来，就永远看不到那个──那只天鹅，那道阳光，那个惊雷！我就永远听不到那种让人神魂颠倒的声音，闻不到那种让人着迷的气味！这一切全亏了你，我最好的朋友！”

水鼠兰特绝望地扭过脸去，不想看他。“你瞧明白了没有？”他隔着托德的脑袋对鼹鼠莫尔说道：“他已经不可救药。我放弃了──到镇上以后我们就去火车站，运气好的话，今晚也许能搭上火车回我们的河岸去。今后你要是再碰上我同这个讨厌的动物一起玩，那才怪呢！”

他从鼻子里嗤了一声。一路走来很累很闷，在剩下的一段路上，他只跟莫尔一个人说话。

一到镇子，他们直接就去了火车站。他们把托德安置在二等候车室，给了搬运工一个两便士的硬币，托他牢牢地看住托德。然后他们把老马寄存在一家客栈的马厩里，对马车和车子里的物件，尽可能详尽地作了说明。一辆慢车终于把他们载到了离蛤蟆府不远的一个车站，他们把中了邪的梦游郎托德护送到家门口，把他弄进屋，吩咐管家喂他吃饭，给他脱衣，把他弄上床。然后他们从停船的棚屋里把船弄出来，向大河下游的家划去，回到自己河边的家。在温暖舒适的客厅里坐下来吃晚饭时，水鼠兰特才感到十分开心和满足。这时候，已经很晚了。

第二天鼹鼠莫尔起得很晚，整天都非常悠闲。傍晚时分，他正坐在河边钓鱼，出去访友闲聊的水鼠兰特回来了，他一路溜达着找到了他。“听到新闻了吗？”他说，“沿河上下，只谈论着一件事。今天托德乘早班火车去镇上预订了一辆很大很贵的汽车。”

第三章　野树林


鼹鼠莫尔想认识獾子班杰已经很久了。听大家说，他是一个很重要的人物。虽然班杰很少露面，但这地方人人都能感觉到他的无形的影响。可是鼹鼠莫尔一提起这个愿望，就发现兰特在拖延他。“行啊，”水鼠兰特会说，“班杰迟早会出现的，他总是很意外地出现，到时候我就把你介绍给他。没有比他再好的人了！但不是非得去找才会碰上他，不定什么时候说碰上就碰上了。”

“你不能请他来吃顿饭什么的？”鼹鼠莫尔说。

“他不会来的，”水鼠兰特简短地说道，“搞社交，发请柬，请客吃饭什么的，这种事班杰全都很讨厌。”

“嗯，那我们过去拜访他怎样？”鼹鼠莫尔提议说。

“哦，我肯定他一点也不喜欢的，”水鼠兰特忧心忡忡地说，“他很害羞，肯定会冒犯他。我本人虽然和他很熟，也从来没有冒险去登门拜访他。另外，我们去不了。那是不可能的，因为他住在野树林正中央。”

“哟，就算他住那地方又怎样，”鼹鼠莫尔说，“你告诉过我野树林没什么问题的，你知道的呀。”

“哦，我知道，我知道，是没问题，”水鼠兰特推托道，“可是我想，我们还是不要说去就去。别赶在这一会儿。路很远，而且不管怎么说，每年这个时候他不在家的，总有一天他会出现，你安安静静等着好了。”

鼹鼠莫尔只好就此知足。可是獾子班杰一直没有出现。每一天都有得玩有得乐，不知不觉，夏天就已经过去很久了。天冷啦，下了霜，道路泥泞，他们只好大多时候待在家里不出门。河水涨了，在窗外奔流着。这时候，无论想玩什么船，想怎样玩船，都只能望着湍急的河水叹气。莫尔发现自己心里又开始念叨起孤单的灰獾班杰，想着他在野树林中央的獾子洞里面，独自一个人打发日子。

冬令时节，水鼠兰特很贪睡，每天早早就上床，很晚才起身。在短短的白昼里，他有时胡乱涂几句诗，或者做点零星家务事，整理一下房子什么的。当然，经常有动物来串门聊天，所以他们听说了许多趣闻逸事。他们还就刚刚过去的夏天发生的所有事情，把自己的见闻拿出来和别人对比对比。

现在回想起来，夏季的一切是多么丰富多彩的一个篇章啊！那时节，盛装的河岸游行队伍源源不断地向前行进着，展开成一幅幅风景图，一幅接一幅，排成蔚为壮观的行列。紫色的珍珠菜早早出场，沿着镜子般的河面的边沿，抖开蓬乱茂密的头发，冲着镜子里自己的笑脸发笑。温柔多情的柳兰，像一片粉色晚霞，来得也不慢。聚合草悄悄地上前，紫的和白的手牵手，在队列中就位。最后，在一个早晨，羞怯的野蔷薇姗姗来迟，步态优雅地登上舞台；好像弦乐以庄严的和弦开始，却变了调，演奏起加伏特舞曲一样，她的到来宣告了六月最终来临。但这团队中有一个成员还没有来到，那就是山林水泽的仙女们追求的牧羊少年，贵妇人娇小姐在窗前等待的骑士，把睡梦中的夏的生命和爱情吻醒的王子。当时，只等穿着琥珀色无袖短上衣的绣线菊，愉快而自信，散发着芬芳，优雅地进入队列，演出就可以开始了。

那是多么精彩的演出啊！如今，在温暖舒适的洞中半昏睡的动物们，听着风雨敲打门窗的声音，还在悠悠地回想昔日的情景：那些个清晨，日出前一小时还寒意凛冽，白蒙蒙的雾紧贴着水面不肯散去，突然间太阳就又与万物同在了，灰色变成了金色，缤纷的色彩重新诞生，再一次从大地中喷薄而出。于是，又有了早早下水的刺激，又有了沿着河岸蹦蹦跳跳奔跑的欢愉，又有了大地、空气和水的辉煌的万千变化。还有那些个炎热的正午，他们懒洋洋躲在下层灌木的深深的绿荫里午睡，但阳光的尖细的金箭依然透射进来，留下了一个个金色的斑点。下午呢，他们去划船、游泳，沿着满是尘土的林荫小路，穿过金黄的小麦田，到处游逛。最后，还有那些长长的、凉爽的黄昏，许多的线路交汇在一起，许多的朋友围绕在身边，许多的为第二天准备的冒险计划被商议出来……是啊，在冬季这些短暂的白昼，动物们围着火炉，有好多好多话题可以谈论。不过，鼹鼠莫尔手头仍然有不少空闲时间，所以呀，一天下午，当水鼠兰特坐在炉火前的扶手椅里，不是打瞌睡，就是为了不合韵的诗琢磨韵脚时，他下了决心，要独自出门去野树林探险，说不定还能和班杰先生交上朋友呢。

那是一个寒冷静谧的下午，头顶上是钢一样灰白的天空。他悄悄地溜出温暖的客厅，来到野外。旷野光秃秃地向四周伸展开去，一片叶子也不见。他觉得自己从来没有像这一个冬天一样，看得那么远，看万物的内里那么透彻。因为这时的大自然，在一年一度的深深的冬眠中，仿佛已经蹬掉了所有的衣服。杂树林、小山谷、采石场……所有隐蔽的地方，在枝叶茂密的夏天曾经是他探险的神秘矿藏；现在呢，它们把自己，把它们的秘密，全都可怜巴巴地裸露出来了。它们仿佛在乞求他暂时忽视他们的破败贫瘠，等待一段时间，等它们像往年一样，再度披上华丽的伪装，恣意狂欢，用老一套把戏来把他哄骗引诱。眼前这场面是有点凄凉，可也让人感到心清气爽，甚至令人振奋。他很高兴自己喜欢这粗犷、不加修饰、褪去了华丽衣装的乡野。他真真地看到了它袒露的骨骼：美好、强健、纯朴。温柔的三叶草的舞蹈，结了籽的青草的摇曳，他不想看；绿树篱的荫庇，山毛榉和榆树波浪起伏的帷帘，最好别来遮蔽他的视线。他心情无比愉快，向野树林前进着：它横卧在他前方，低矮而凶险，就像南方寂静的大海上一片黑咕隆咚的暗礁。

刚走进去时，并没有什么东西让他感到惊恐。细树枝在他脚下发出断裂的响声，倒伏的树干把他绊倒，树桩上的菌菇长得像漫画，冷不丁看一眼会吓他一跳，因为它们很像一种熟悉而又遥远的东西。不过这一切很有趣，而且令人兴奋。它们一步步引导他向前，可越往里面走，光线越黯淡，树木蹲伏得越密；左右两边的洞穴，冲他张着丑陋的大嘴。

万籁俱寂。暮色从前后两个方向聚拢来，不断地迅速向他逼近；光线像洪水退走一样退去。

这时鬼脸开始出现。

一开始，他觉得模模糊糊瞥见肩膀后面有一张脸：一张邪恶的楔形小脸，正从一个洞里窥望着他。当他转过脸去面对它时，那东西却消失了。

他加快脚步，打起精神，告诉自己不要胡思乱想，否则那东西就会没完没了地出现。他经过一个一个又一个洞穴，有！──没有！──有！当然，有一张窄窄的小脸，目光很凶，瞬间在一个洞口一闪，又消失了。他犹豫了一下，又壮起胆子硬着头皮大步往前走。突然，仿佛向来就是如此似的，远远近近每一个洞口，一共几百个洞口，好像都有脸在闪现，迅速地出现、消失。它们全都恶狠狠地盯着他：每一张脸都邪恶狡诈，一道道目光都很凶。

他心想，只要能离开斜坡上那些洞，就不会再有脸出现了。他纵身一跃，离开小路，钻进了人迹未至的林中。

但是又出现了哨音。

刚开始时听上去微弱尖细，在他身后很远的地方，可不知为什么，却催他加快脚步向前奔。接着，那声音听起来又好像在前方很远的地方了，仍然很微弱很尖细，弄得他犹豫起来，想往回走。正当他停住脚步拿不定主意时，前面后面哨音同时响起来，仿佛在整个林子里响应着传递着，一直到它最远的边缘。很明显，它们都警觉起来做好准备了，无论它们是谁！可他呢，他只身一人，赤手空拳，孤立无援，而黑夜正在逼近。

接着响起了啪嗒啪嗒的声音。

开始他以为那不过是落叶声，因为那声音很轻很细；然后它慢慢变响了，变得很有节奏，他明白了，那不是别的，正是小脚爪啪啪的脚步声，此刻仍然离他很远。在前面，还是在后面？好像开始在前面，接着在后面，然后前面后面都响起来了。越来越响，越来越多，最后四面八方都是啪嗒啪嗒的声音。他忧心忡忡，听听这边，又听听那边，那些声音似乎正在向他逼近。他正不出声地站在那里倾听着，忽然一只兔子从树丛间穿过，猛地向他冲来。他没有动弹，指望兔子放慢脚步，或者改变方向朝别的地方奔跑。可那动物竟直直地猛冲过来，过去时差一点擦到他；顿时他的脸僵住了，眼睛瞪大了。“别挡道，笨蛋，滚开！”鼹鼠莫尔听到他咕哝了一句，看见他绕过一个树桩，钻进一个共用的洞穴，就不见了。

啪嗒声越来越响，最后听起来就像突然降落的冰雹，砸在他周围厚厚的落叶层上。现在似乎整个林子都在奔跑，在狂奔，在猎杀，在追捕，在包围某个东西──或者某个动物？他一阵恐慌，也开始漫无目的地奔跑起来，却根本不知道要跑去什么地方。他撞到东西，摔倒在东西上，拱进东西里面，扎到东西下面，闪身避过东西。最后他在一棵老山毛榉又深又黑的树洞里找到了避难所，它能给他庇护，让他隐身，也许还能提供安全，但是谁能说得准呢？不过，无论如何，他已经太累了，再也跑不动，只能蜷伏在往日飘进树洞里的枯叶上，希望暂时平安无事。他躺在那里喘息、哆嗦，听着外面的哨音和啪嗒声，终于恍然大悟：田野上和灌木树篱中其他小居民在这里碰上的恐怖事物，他们所谓的最黑暗的时刻，就是野树林的恐怖！水鼠兰特曾经想保护他，不让他遭遇到它，却最终没能阻止。

这时候呀，水鼠兰特正浑身暖洋洋、舒舒服服地在炉火旁打盹。写了一半的诗稿从他膝盖上滑落下来；他脑袋后仰，嘴巴张开着，正在梦中的翠绿河岸上漫游。这时一块煤滑落下来，炉子里噼啪一声，喷出一道火苗，把他惊醒了。他想起刚才做的事，伸手到地板上捡起诗稿，苦思冥想了一分钟，然后转动脑袋寻找鼹鼠莫尔，想问问他知不知道某个地方用什么韵脚好。

但是鼹鼠莫尔不在。

他听了一会儿。屋子里好像很安静。

然后他叫道：“鼹仔！”一连几声，没人回答，于是他站起身来走出去，来到门厅里。

鼹鼠莫尔往常挂帽子的钩子上，帽子不见了。总是放在雨伞旁边的胶套鞋也没了踪影。

水鼠兰特走出屋子，仔细察看着泥泞的地面，希望发现鼹鼠莫尔的脚印。找到了，肯定没错。胶套鞋是新的，新买了过冬用的，鞋底上的小豆豆清晰鲜明。他看得出，泥地上的鞋印去向明确，直直的一串，直奔野树林。

水鼠兰特神情非常严肃，站着沉思了一两分钟。然后他走进屋子，在腰里系上一根皮带，插进去几把手枪，抄起靠在门厅角落的一根很粗的棍棒，撒腿向野树林跑去。

他到达林子第一排树跟前时，天色已经黑下来了。他毫不犹豫地一头冲进林子，边走边焦急地向两边张望，寻找朋友的踪迹。从洞中东一张西一张冒出一张张邪恶的小脸，但一看到这勇武的动物，看到他的手枪，看到他手里那根凶恶的大棒子，它们便立刻消失了。他刚进树林时听得很分明的哨音和啪嗒声，也渐渐消失了，停止了。一片静寂。他勇敢地穿过整个林子，一直走到它最远的边缘；然后，他撇开所有的小径，开始横穿树林，仔细搜索着每一块地方，并且一直很带劲儿地呼喊着：“鼹仔，鼹仔，鼹仔！你在哪里？是我呀，我是老兰特！”

他在林子里耐心地搜寻了一个多小时，终于听到一个细微的哭声在回应他，他好高兴。顺着声音的方向，穿过越来越浓重的黑暗，他摸索着来到一颗老山毛榉的树根前面。树上有一个洞，洞里传出一个有气无力的声音：“鼠仔！真的是你吗？”

水鼠兰特爬进洞里，找到了精疲力竭、仍然在发抖的鼹鼠莫尔。“哇，兰特！”莫尔嚷嚷道，“你想象不到，我被吓死了！”

“哦，我十分理解，”水鼠兰特安慰道，“你真不该这么干，莫尔。我一直尽力阻止你。我们河边居民几乎从不单独来这里。就算非得来，至少也会成双结对，那样一般不会出问题。另外，有上百件事必须了解，我们都懂，现在你还不懂呢。我说的是有用和有效的口令、暗号和暗语，口袋里要带的植物，要背诵的诗，脱逃的计策，哄骗的花招。这些都很简单，等你了解了就一点不难；可如果你是小动物，就得学会，否则就会遇上麻烦。当然，如果你是班杰或奥特，那就是另外一回事了。”

“托德先生肯定不在乎独自来这里吧，是不？”鼹鼠莫尔问。

“老托德？”水鼠兰特开怀大笑，“他不会单独在这里露面的。给托德满满一帽子金币，他也不会来。”

听着水鼠兰特爽朗的笑声，看到他的棍棒和亮闪闪的手枪，鼹鼠莫尔大受鼓舞。他停止了哆嗦，胆子开始大起来，心神渐渐恢复镇定。

“行啦，”水鼠兰特就说，“我们真得打起精神，趁着还有一点光亮，动身回家。在这里过夜是不行的，你明白。第一，太冷了。”

“亲爱的鼠仔，”可怜的莫尔说道，“非常非常抱歉，可我真是累坏了，不带一点假。如果一定得回家，也得让我在这里再歇一歇，恢复恢复力气。”

“哦，好吧，”和善的兰特说道，“反正现在天已经差不多黑透了，而且过一会儿该有一点月光的。”

于是鼹鼠莫尔钻到干树叶里，舒展开身体，就一下子睡着了。不过他时睡时醒，还做噩梦。水鼠兰特为了暖和些，尽量把自己捂紧，他躺在那里耐心等待着，爪子里握着一支手枪。

鼹鼠莫尔一觉醒来，精神好了许多，也恢复了往常的心情。水鼠兰特说道：“行啦！我来瞄一眼外面，看看是不是一切都平静，然后我们就真的必须出发了。”

他来到藏身处的入口，把脑袋伸出去。接着，鼹鼠莫尔听到他平静地自言自语道：“嗬！嗬！糟啦！”

“出什么事啦，鼠仔？”鼹鼠莫尔问。

“出雪啦，”水鼠兰特简短地答道，“或者不如说，下雪啦。雪下得很大。”

鼹鼠莫尔钻过来，趴在他旁边往外看，只见那曾经把他吓个半死的树林，已经完全变了样。地洞、树洞、水坑、陷阱和其他威胁过路人的凶险，都在迅速地消失，一张亮晶晶的仙毯，正从四面八方迅速地长出来，它看上去那么纤弱柔美，容不得粗鲁的脚去践踏。细细的粉末漫天飘洒着，爱抚着人的脸颊，带着一丁点刺痛感。一片仿佛来自下面的光，将一根根黝黑的树干映现了出来。

“咳，咳，没办法的事，”水鼠兰特想了想，说道，“我看，我们得动身，碰碰运气。最糟糕的是，我不十分清楚我们在哪里。现在雪把一切都弄得面目全非了。”

确实如此。鼹鼠莫尔都认不出这就是原先那个树林了。不管怎样，他们还是勇敢地出发了。他们选了一条看上去最有前途的路线，互相紧紧地搀扶着，做出一副所向无敌的神气样子。他们每碰到一棵冷冰冰不言不语的新树，都假装认出了一位老朋友；再就是对着白茫茫一成不变的雪原和黑黝黝千篇一律的树干，假装意外地看到了熟悉的通道出口、豁口或小路。

一两个小时以后──他们已经没法计算时间──他们停了下来，疲倦萎靡，迷惘绝望，在一根倒伏的树干上坐下来，喘口气，想一想下一步怎么办。他们累得腰酸背痛，摔得鼻青脸肿，已经好几次掉进洞里，弄得浑身透湿。雪越积越厚，他们的小腿儿陷进去几乎已经拔不出来；树越来越密，比以往任何时候都显得面目雷同。这林子仿佛没有尽头，没有边际，也没有差别，最糟的是，没有出去的路。

“我们不能在这里坐很久，”水鼠兰特说，“我们得再冲一下，出点别的招。太冷了，没人经得住，雪很快就会深得蹚不过去。”他张望着四周，想了想：“瞧，我是这样想的。前面有一个像小山谷一样的地方，那里全是小土丘，小土包，小土堆一类的地形。我们可以走到那里，找个地方避避，有个洞就行，大小不管，只要地上不湿，落不到雪吹不到风。我们可以在洞里好好歇一歇，然后再想办法出去。我们俩都已经累得要死了，而且，说不定过一阵子雪会停，或者出现别的情况。”

于是他们重新站起来，吃力地向前走，进了小山谷。他们四下里搜寻，要找一个干的洞穴或者角落，抵挡刺骨的风和飞旋的雪。他们正在察看水鼠兰特说的一个小圆丘，鼹鼠莫尔突然被绊倒，一声尖叫，摔了个嘴啃泥。

“哇，我的腿！”他叫喊着，“哇，我可怜的小腿！”他翻身从雪地上坐起来，用两只前爪揉着腿。

“可怜的老莫尔！”水鼠兰特很温和地说，“今天你好像不怎么走运，是不？让我瞧瞧你的腿。是的，你的小腿划破了。”为了看清楚些，他跪了下来，然后说道：“没错。等一下，我把手绢拿出来，帮你包扎好。”

“我一定是绊在看不到的树枝或树桩上了，”鼹鼠莫尔惨兮兮地说，“哦，天！哦，天！”

“伤口很整齐，”水鼠兰特又仔细检查了一遍，说道，“绝对不是树枝或树桩划破的。看上去好像是金属物件的边锋割的。奇怪！”他沉思了一会儿，然后察看着周围的土丘和斜坡。

“嗳，别去管它什么干的，”鼹鼠莫尔说，痛得连语法都顾不上了，“不管是什么割的，反正一样是割伤了。”

但是水鼠兰特用手绢仔细包扎好他的腿后，就丢下他，忙着在雪地里刨起来。他又是刮又是挖又是扒拉，四条腿忙得不亦乐乎。鼹鼠莫尔等得不耐烦了，隔一会儿嚷一句：“哦，算了吧，兰特！”

突然水鼠兰特叫了一声：“万岁！”接着又叫了一声：“万——安——安——安——岁！”然后有气无力地在雪地里表演起快步舞来。

“你发现了什么，鼠仔？”鼹鼠莫尔问，仍然在揉他的腿。

“过来看呀！”兴高采烈的兰特一边说，一边继续跳舞。

鼹鼠莫尔一瘸一拐地走上前去，看了好一会儿。

“嗨，”最后他慢条斯理地说道，“我看得很明白了。以前也见过这种东西，好多次。我叫它常见物品。一块门前刮泥板！哟，这有什么呀？干吗围着一块刮泥板跳快步舞？”

“可你没明白它意味着什么吗，你──你这个木头脑瓜？”水鼠兰特不耐烦地嚷嚷道。

“我当然明白意味着什么，”鼹鼠莫尔答道，“只不过意味着一个非常粗心、记性不好的人，把刮泥板丢在了野树林中央，正好搁在人人都肯定会绊到的地方。要我说，他真是没脑子。回家以后，我要去控告这件事，向……向什么人，看我不告他！”

“天哪，天哪！”水鼠兰特嚷嚷道，对他的迟钝感到绝望，“得啦，别争了，来刨吧！”他又动手挖起来，弄得四周雪花飞溅。

又辛苦了一阵子，他的努力得到了回报，一块很破旧的门前擦鞋垫暴露在眼前。

“瞧，我跟你说什么来着？”水鼠兰特得意扬扬地欢呼。

“绝对什么也算不上，”鼹鼠莫尔十分诚实地答道，“好吧，算你又找到一件家用杂物，没法再用就扔了，我看你十分开心呢。如果你非得围着它跳舞，最好就跳起来吧，跳完了，我们可以接着赶路，不用再为这些垃圾堆浪费时间。一块门前擦鞋垫，能吃吗？还是能盖在身上睡觉？还是能当雪橇，坐在上面滑雪回家？你这个气人的啮齿动物！”

“你……真的……以……为，”兴奋的兰特嚷道，“这擦鞋垫什么也不能告诉你吗？”

“确实，兰特，”鼹鼠莫尔气呼呼地说，“我看，我们这样犯傻也犯够了。有谁听说过擦鞋垫能告诉人什么事？擦鞋垫就是不会说话。擦鞋垫根本就不是会说话的物件。擦鞋垫知道自己的位置在哪里。”

“听着，你这个笨脑瓜动物，”水鼠兰特回敬道，他真的生气了，“别这样没个完。别再多说一句废话，如果你今夜还想干干爽爽、暖暖和和睡一觉的话，只管挖就行了──挖、刨、掘、扒拉，特别是土丘四周，因为这是我们最后的机会！”

水鼠兰特来劲儿地向身旁一面雪坡发起了进攻，他用棍棒到处刺探，然后又发飙似地挖掘。鼹鼠莫尔也在忙着刨，不为别的，只是为水鼠兰特效劳而已。按照他的观点，他的朋友是脑袋发晕了。

苦干了大约十分钟后，水鼠兰特的棍子尖碰到了一样发出空洞声音的东西。他接着挖，终于可以伸进去一只爪子，摸到它了。于是他叫鼹鼠莫尔过去帮他。两只动物使劲儿挖呀挖，终于，他们的劳动成果完全展现在了眼前。到目前为止，一直表示怀疑的莫尔，看了不由得一惊。

就在刚才看上去像是一面雪坡的地方，旁边出现了一道样子很结实的门，门漆成深绿色，一侧悬着一根拉铃铁链，门环下方镶着一块小铜牌，上面整整齐齐地用正方形大写字母刻着几个字，借着月光，他们辨认出来了：

班杰先生

鼹鼠莫尔惊呆了，乐坏了，仰面倒在雪地上。“兰特！”他大声表示悔罪，“你是个奇才！真正的奇才，奇才你就是。现在我全明白了！从我摔倒割伤小腿那一刻开始，你的聪明脑瓜就在一步一步证明这一点。你看着伤口，你那高贵的脑袋就自言自语道：‘是刮泥板！’然后你起劲儿地干起来，找到了割伤我的那块刮泥板！你有没有到此为止？没有。换了别人，就会很满足了，但你没有。你的聪明脑袋继续思考。‘只要找到一块门前擦鞋垫，’你对自己说，‘我的推测就得到证明了！’当然，你找到了那块擦鞋垫。你太聪明了，我相信你想找什么都能找到。‘这样的话，’你对自己说，‘肯定有一扇门，就像已经在我眼前一样明摆着。剩下的事，就是把它找出来了！’嗨，这种事我在书里面读到过，但在真实生活里却从来没有碰见过。你应该到你能够展露才华的地方去。在这里，在我们这样的家伙中间，简直是浪费你的才华。如果我有你那样一个脑瓜，鼠仔……”

“既然你没有，”水鼠兰特有点刻薄地打断了他，“我看你是打算要坐在雪地上说上一整夜啦。快站起来吧，看见那根拉铃铁链没有，去拉，使劲儿，有多大劲儿使多大劲儿，我来擂门！”

水鼠兰特用棍子对着门发起了进攻，鼹鼠莫尔跳起来抓住拉铃铁链，两脚离地吊在上面晃荡。隔着很远的距离，一阵隐约可辨的低沉的铃声回应了他们。





第四章　班杰先生


他们耐心等待着，在雪地上跺着脚，好让脚暖和些。仿佛等了很久，终于，他们听见拖拖沓沓的脚步声从里面向门口来了。正像鼹鼠莫尔对水鼠兰特说的那样，仿佛有个人在穿着毡子拖鞋走路，鞋太大，而且鞋跟磨掉了很多。这一回莫尔很聪明，因为事实正是这样。

响起门闩弹开的声音，门开了几英寸，刚够露出一个长长的嘴，一双睡意惺忪、眨巴眨巴的眼睛。

“嗨，下一回再发生这样的事，”一个粗哑的、带着猜疑的声音传来，“我会非常非常生气的。这一回是谁呀，这么冷的天，半夜三更来吵人家？说话！”

“哦，班杰，”水鼠兰特嚷道，“请让我们进去。是我，兰特，还有我朋友莫尔，我们在雪地里迷路了。”

“哇，鼠仔，我亲爱的小伙子！”獾子班杰欢呼道，完全换了一种声音，“快进来，你们俩，快快。呀，你们一定冻坏了。喔哟哟！在雪地里迷路！还是在野树林里，而且是晚上的这个时候！赶快进来吧。”

两只动物急着进去，互相绊倒了。听到门在身后关上的声音，他们高兴得要命，大大地松了一口气。

獾子班杰穿一件长晨衣，脚上一双拖鞋的鞋跟真的磨掉了许多。他的爪子举着一个扁平的烛台，听到他们敲门时，可能正要上床睡觉呢。他低下头亲切地看着他们，拍了拍他俩的脑袋。“这样的夜晚可不适合小动物出门，”他用长辈一样的口吻说道，“恐怕你又在搞什么恶作剧吧，鼠仔。过来，到厨房里来。里面有一等一的炉火，有晚饭，什么都有。”

班杰举着烛火，在前面拖着脚走。他们俩在后面跟着，互相用胳膊肘捅捅对方，意思是有想不到的好事。他们穿过一条很长很暗，而且说真的，实在很破败的过道，走进了一个中央大厅模样的房间。从这里望出去，可以模模糊糊地看到另外几条幽长的像隧道一样的过道，很神秘，一眼望不到头。但这厅里也有门──很厚重，看上去很舒服的橡木门。獾子班杰打开其中一扇，他们立刻就发现自己来到了一间很大的厨房，里面生着火，亮堂堂，暖融融。

地上铺着红砖，磨损得很旧了。宽敞的壁炉炉床上，木头燃着火苗，两个引人注目的壁炉角陷进墙体，通风肯定不会出问题。炉前两侧面对面放着两张高背长椅，这是为喜爱交际的人增设的座位。厨房中间的一张长桌子，是在支架上搁些木坯板架起来的，两边放着长凳。长桌一头摊着獾子班杰吃剩的晚餐，饭菜简单，却很多，一张扶手椅已经推回去靠着桌子。厨房另一端的碗柜里，一排排洁净的盘子闪着亮光。头顶上的椽子上吊着一根根火腿、一捆捆干草、一兜兜洋葱，还有一篮篮鸡蛋。这地方真棒，仿佛能供英雄凯旋大摆庆功宴；能供一大帮子疲惫的农夫收割归来排坐在桌旁，欢歌笑语庆祝丰收；也能供两三个口味简朴的朋友随意坐坐，舒舒服服、称心如意地吃吃饭，抽抽烟，聊聊天。红润的砖地冲着烟熏的天花板微笑；因用了多年而磨出亮光的橡木长椅互相快乐地交换着眼神；碗柜上的盘子冲着架子上的锅壶咧嘴傻笑，而愉快的炉火摇曳着，一视同仁，朝屋子里的每一样东西闪烁着光亮。

班杰和和气气把他们按到长椅上坐好，让他们烤烤火，吩咐他们脱掉湿外套和靴子。然后，他给他们拿来了晨衣和拖鞋，亲自用热水为鼹鼠莫尔洗小腿，在伤口处贴上膏药──最后，如果说整个感觉并不比原先更好，也已经完好如初了。光和热的拥抱，终于让他们干爽暖和了。他们把疲惫的腿架起来，身后桌子上响着馋人的杯盘叮当声。这两只被暴风雪追逐的动物，此刻已经在安全的港湾里。他们刚刚逃脱的那寒冷无路的野树林，仿佛已经离开好远好远。他们所受的苦，仿佛已经成了一个遗忘了一半的梦。

獾子班杰一直忙着在桌子上摆放饭菜，等他们终于烤干了，就唤他俩坐过去。两个家伙早就感到很饿了，这会儿真的看见晚饭摆在面前，似乎只有一个问题需要解决，就是先进攻哪一盘。因为每一盘都那么诱人，进攻了这一盘，不知道其余的会不会乖乖地等到他们有时间把注意力转移过去。好长时间，说话是根本不可能了；渐渐地重新顾得上时，又因为嘴巴里塞得满满的，说起话来那样子好叫人懊恼。獾子班杰根本不介意这种事，也完全不在意他们把胳膊肘支在桌子上，或者两个人同时说话。他本人不参加社交活动，所以有一个想法，就是这种事无关紧要（当然，我们知道他这样想不对，视野太狭窄。虽然为什么要紧得解释半天，这种事还是很要紧的）。他坐在餐桌主位那张扶手椅上，听两只动物讲他们的经历，不时严肃地点点头。无论听到什么事，他似乎都不感到惊讶或震撼，也决不说什么“我跟你们说过的”或者“我不是一直那样说的吗”，或者发表一点高见，认为他们本该这样不该那样。鼹鼠莫尔开始觉得他非常可亲。

晚餐终于真正结束了，两只动物都感到自己不但脸皮保住了，肚皮也绷紧了，而且现在对任何人任何事都满不在乎。于是他们围坐在那一大堆红光灼灼的木头炭火余烬旁，心想，这么晚、这么饱、这么自由自在地坐着，多么快活。他们东拉西扯地聊了一阵之后，獾子班杰热心地说道：“行啦！说说你们那个天地里的事情吧。老托德怎样啦？”

“哦，越来越糟。”水鼠兰特语气沉重，而鼹鼠莫尔却半躺在长凳上，对着火光取暖，把脚后跟翘得比头还高，努力做出一副应景的沉痛表情。“就在上个礼拜，又出了车祸，很严重。你是知道的，他坚持自己开车，可又无可救药地没那个本事。其实他只要雇个名声好、稳重可靠、训练有素的动物，多付点薪水，把一切交给他，就可以万事大吉。可托德不干，自以为天生会开车，谁也做不了他的老师，后面那些事就免不了喽。”

“有多少？”獾子班杰忧郁地问。

“多少次车祸，还是多少辆车？”水鼠兰特反问道，“哦，嗨，说到底是一回事──对托德来说。这是第七辆了。至于另外那些──你知道他那间马车房吗？咳，里面堆满了──堆到屋顶，一点也不夸张──全是汽车碎片，没有一块大过你的帽子！那就是另外六辆的结果──顶多是这样的结果了。”

“他住过三次医院，”鼹鼠莫尔插言道，“至于他不得不交的罚款数目，简直想想都叫人害怕。”

“事情有一部分就坏在这上头，”水鼠兰特接着说道，“我们都知道，托德有钱，但他并不是百万富翁。他开车的本事烂得无可救药，又完全不把法律和秩序放在眼里。丧命或者破产──只有这两种结果，早晚的事哟。班杰！我们是他的朋友，不该采取一点行动吗？”

獾子班杰冥思苦想了一会儿。“听我说！”最后他相当严肃地说道，“现在我什么都不能做，你们一定知道的吧？”

两位朋友表示同意，他们完全理解他话里的意思。按照动物界的规矩，在冬闲季节，不能指望任何动物，做出任何费力的、英雄式的，甚至不很过分活跃的举动。所有动物都在半眠状态，有的完全入眠了。所有动物多多少少都受到气候的约束。以往辛苦谋生的日日夜夜里，所有动物的每一块肌肉都经受了严格的考验，每一分力气都消耗够了，现在正是休息的时候。

“那就好！”獾子班杰继续往下说，“不过，一旦真的过了年，黑夜变短，人到半夜就醒来，心里面感到躁动，盼着天快亮好起床做事，甚至等不到太阳出来──你们知道的！”

两只动物严肃地点点头。他们知道！

“嗯，到那时候，”獾子班杰接着说道，“我们，就是说，你，我，还有我们这位朋友鼹鼠莫尔──我们要严肃地管教托德，坚决不容许他再胡闹。我们要让他恢复理智，有必要的话，采用武力。我们要把他塑造成一个明智的托德。我们要──你睡着了，兰特！”

“我没有！”水鼠兰特一个激灵醒过来，说道。

“吃完晚饭他已经睡着两三回了。”鼹鼠莫尔笑着说。他自己感觉十分清醒，甚至有些兴奋，尽管他不知道为什么。当然啦，那原因就是，他天生就是一只地下动物，生在地下长在地下，班杰家的环境正适合他，让他感到自在舒心。水鼠兰特却是每晚睡在开着窗户的卧室里，窗外是微风吹拂的河流，自然会感到这里气氛呆滞压抑。

“哟，不早了，我们都去睡吧，”獾子班杰说，拿起扁平烛台，站起身来，“你们二位跟我来，我带你们去住处。明天不用早起，什么时候吃早饭都行！”

他领着两只动物来到一个长长的房间里，它看上去一半像卧室，一半像堆东西的阁楼。确实，獾子班杰的过冬储藏品到处可见，占了差不多半间屋子──成堆成堆的苹果、萝卜、土豆，一篮篮的干果，一罐罐的蜂蜜。不过，房间里剩余的地方安放着的两张白色小床，看上去很柔软、很诱人。亚麻被单床单虽然粗糙，却干干净净，散发着美妙的熏衣草香气。鼹鼠莫尔和水鼠兰特只用三十秒就甩掉了衣服，一骨碌钻进被窝，快活无比，心满意足。

遵照好心班杰的指示，第二天早晨两只疲惫的动物很晚才下去吃早饭。他们看见厨房里生着明亮的火，有两只小刺猬坐在桌旁的长凳上，捧着木碗喝燕麦片粥。他俩一进来，刺猬们就放下小勺，站起身，恭敬地行了个低头礼。

“好啦，坐下，坐下，”水鼠兰特高兴地说，“接着喝你们的粥吧。你们两个小家伙从哪里来？在雪地里迷路了，我没猜错吧？”

“是的，的确，先生，”大一点的那只刺猬恭敬地说，“我和这个小比利，我们找路去上学，妈妈非要我们去上学，说天气总是这样的。我们当然就迷路了，先生。比利年纪小、胆子小，害怕了，吓着了，哭了。最后我们碰巧来到班杰先生家的后门口，大着胆子敲门，先生，因为大家都知道，班杰先生是位好心肠的绅士……”

“我明白。”水鼠兰特说着给自己切了几片熏肉。这时鼹鼠莫尔正往小炖锅里打蛋。“外面天气怎么样？别老是‘先生’‘先生’地叫我好吗？”兰特加上一句。

“哦，糟透了，先生，雪深得要命，”刺猬说，“你们这样的绅士，今天出不了门的。”

“班杰去哪里了？”鼹鼠莫尔一边在炉子上热咖啡，一边问。

“主人去书房了，先生，”刺猬答道，“他说今天上午他特别忙，千万别去打扰他。”

这个解释，在场的人当然心知肚明。其实，就像先前说过的那样，一年里你忙乎了六个月，生活得很紧张，另外六个月里比较犯困或者实在困得很。这时候有人来了，或者有事情要办，你总不能老是说我想睡觉吧。老用这个理由太单调。动物们很清楚，班杰吃了一顿丰盛的早餐后，已经躲进书房，倒在扶手椅里，两条腿搁在另一张扶手椅上，脸上蒙着一块红色棉布手绢，忙他在一年里这个时候通常要“忙”的事情去了。

前门的门铃声大作，水鼠兰特正在吃黄油烤面包，一爪子的油，就派比利，那个年龄小的刺猬，去看看来人是谁。门厅里一阵跺脚声，比利就回来了，后面跟着水獭奥特。奥特扑到水鼠兰特身上，抱住他，亲亲热热地大声问好。

“走开！”水鼠兰特鼓着满满的嘴，发急道。

“就料到会在这里找着你，果然没错，”水獭奥特快活地说，“今天早上我到河岸的时候，那一带的人都万分恐慌。兰特整夜没回家──莫尔也是──他们说，肯定发生了什么可怕的事，当然，雪把你们的踪迹全覆盖了。但我知道，人们在困境中多半会去找班杰，要不然，班杰也一定知道些情况，所以我就穿过野树林和雪地，直接上这里来啦！天！穿过雪地时，红彤彤的太阳刚升起来，阳光照亮了黑黝黝的树干，天气真好！在一片静寂中往前走，时不时一大团雪突然从树枝上滑落下来，噗的一声！吓得你跳起来，赶紧跑开找个地方躲藏。一夜之间，不知从什么地方冒出来许多雪城堡、雪洞穴，还有雪桥、雪台子、雪护墙──我本可以停下来，和它们玩上几个钟头呢。这里那里，粗大的树枝被雪压断了，知更鸟栖在上面，蹦蹦跳跳，神气活现，好像那是它们干的似的。头顶上，高高的灰色天空中，一行大雁参差不齐地飞过去。几只秃鼻乌鸦在树梢上方盘旋、巡察，然后露出厌恶的神情，扑打着翅膀飞回家去。但我就是没遇上一个明事理的能向他打听消息。大约走过一半路时，我碰上一只兔子坐在树桩上，正用爪子洗他那张傻乎乎的脸。我悄悄地来到他身后，把一只前爪重重地搭在他肩上，可把他吓蒙了。我只好在他脑袋上拍了一两下，让他稍微清醒清醒。最后我总算从他那里掏出了一点消息，昨晚他们有一只兔子在野树林见到了莫尔。他说，兔子洞里都在传，说莫尔，兰特先生特要好的那个朋友，遇上大麻烦啦；说他迷了路，‘他们’都跑出去，跑到上面去追赶他，搅得他团团乱转。‘那你们就没有一个人帮他一把？’我问，‘也许老天没赐给你们脑子，但你们这些家伙有成百上千，又粗又壮，肥得像黄油，你们的洞穴四通八达，满可以收留他，让他舒舒服服，平平安安。不管怎样，总可以试一下的。’‘什么，我们？’他只是说，‘帮他一把？我们兔子？’听了这话我只有再拍他一巴掌，然后走路。没别的办法哟。好歹知道了一点消息。要是我有幸遇到‘他们’中的一个，我会多领教一些的──否则就让他们领教领教。”

“你一点都不……呃……紧张？”鼹鼠莫尔问，提起野树林，昨天的恐惧又袭上了他的心头。

“紧张？”水獭奥特露出一排闪亮结实的白牙，笑了，“他们有谁碰我一下试试，看我不让他紧张一下。嗨，莫尔，你一向都是个很乖的小家伙，去给我煎几片火腿吧。我饿坏了，这不还有许多话要和鼠仔说呢。几十年没见他了。”

于是，和善的莫尔切了几片火腿，分派刺猬们去煎，自己回来继续吃早饭。水獭奥特和水鼠兰特两个脑袋凑到一起，起劲儿地谈起河水经来，那些经那些话，就像那潺潺的河水一样，滔滔不绝。

一盘煎火腿刚被清空，拿回去再盛，这时獾子班杰进来了。他打个哈欠，揉揉眼睛，用他那种平静朴素的方式跟大家打个招呼，亲切地向每一个人问了好。“一定快到午饭时间了，”他对水獭奥特说，“最好留下来和我们一起吃。你一定饿了，今天上午真冷。”

“的确！”水獭奥特答道，朝鼹鼠莫尔挤了挤眼睛。“看着这些贪吃的小刺猬往嘴巴里塞煎火腿，让我感到饿极了。”

两只刺猬早上喝过粥，然后辛辛苦苦地煎火腿，这时又饿了。他们怯生生地抬眼望着班杰先生，却不好意思开口。

“那好，你们两个小家伙回去找妈妈吧，”獾子班杰和蔼地说道，“我派人给你们指路。我敢肯定，今天你们用不着吃正餐了。”

他轻轻地拍拍他们的脑袋，给了他们六便士。他们恭恭敬敬地行了挥帽礼，又行了军礼，走了。

大家就坐下来一起吃中饭。鼹鼠莫尔发现自己被安排在班杰先生旁边，另外两位依然十分投入地聊他们的河边闲话，什么也不能让他们分心。他就趁机对班杰说，这里的一切使他感到多么舒适，像在家里一样。“一回到地下，”他说，“你心里就踏实了。麻烦找不到你，坏人逮不着你。你完全是自己的主人，不用征求别人的意见，不用在意别人怎么说。上面的世界原先怎样还怎样，你不用管它，不用为它操心。想上去时就上去看看，一切都在那里呐，在等着你。”

獾子班杰朴实地冲着他绽开了笑脸。“那正是我要说的，”他答道，“除了地下，没有哪里安全太平，让人心定神闲。再说，如果你心气高了，想扩大地盘──喏，只要挖一挖，刨一刨，就好了！如果你觉得屋子大了点，只要堵上一两个洞眼，又好了！用不着建筑工，不用跟商人打交道，没有人爬到墙头上观看，说三道四，最重要的是，没有天气好坏。就拿兰特来说吧。河水上涨一两英尺，他就得租个住处搬家，不舒服，也不方便，租金还贵得吓人。再说托德。对蛤蟆府我无话可讲，要说房子，那是这一带最好的。可是假如突然失火──托德去哪里呢？假如瓦片被风刮掉，或者墙体下沉、开裂，或者窗户打碎了──托德去哪里呢？假如房间里灌风──我本人讨厌灌风──托德去哪里呢？是啊，出个门，到上面去逛逛，买些生活必需品回来，这挺不错，可最后还得回到地下──这就是我对家的观念！”

这番话鼹鼠莫尔衷心赞成。于是乎，獾子班杰和他处得很投缘了。“吃过午饭，”他说，“我带你到处转转，参观一下我这个小地方。我看得出来，你会喜欢它的。你懂得住宅建筑应该是什么样，你懂。”

午饭后，另外两位坐到壁炉角跟前，已经围绕着鳗鱼这个题目热烈地争论起来。獾子班杰点起一盏灯笼，吩咐鼹鼠莫尔跟着他。他们穿过门厅，沿着一条主通道往前走，灯笼摇曳的光映现出两边大大小小的房间。有些只是壁橱，有的却宽敞气派，比得上托德的大宴会厅。一条垂直相交的窄过道引着他们来到另一条走廊，这里的情形和前一条一模一样。这建筑规模宏大、枝杈繁多、通道幽暗冗长，储藏室塞满东西的拱顶坚实牢固，到处是砖石结构、拱门、铺砌过的路面，看得鼹鼠莫尔目瞪口呆。最后他说道：“班杰，你究竟哪来那么多时间和精力做这一切的？真让人吃惊！”

“要是我干的，那确实会让人吃惊，”獾子班杰朴实地说，“可事实上呢，我什么也没干──我只是把通道和房间清理出来，需要多少清理多少。还有很多这样的地方，四周全都是。我知道你不明白，我得给你解释一下。嗯，很久以前，现在野树林起伏的这块地方，在它出现并生长到现在的规模之前，曾经是一座城池──你知道的啰，人类的城池。在这里，在我们现在站立的地方，他们生活、赶路、谈话、睡觉、办事。他们在这里养马、开宴会，他们从这里出发，骑马去打仗，赶车去做生意。他们是强大的人民，很富有，是了不起的建筑师。他们把房子造得非常经久耐用，因为他们以为，他们的城池会永存不灭。”

“后来呢，他们全都去哪里了？”鼹鼠莫尔问。

“谁知道呢？”獾子班杰说，“人们来了，待了一阵子，繁荣兴旺起来，然后又去了。他们就是这样子。可我们留下来了。我听说，在城池出现之前很久，这里就有獾子了。现在獾子还在这里。我们是一个持久的族群，可能会搬走一阵子，可我们能等待，我们有耐心，我们会回来。永远是这样。”

“嗯，那些人，最后他们都走了，后来发生了什么事？”鼹鼠莫尔问。

“他们走后，”獾子班杰接着说道，“大风和连绵不断的雨掌控了时事，长年累月，经久不衰。也许我们獾子也尽到绵薄之力，帮了点小忙──谁知道呢？城池渐渐往下沉，沉，沉──坍塌了，夷平了，消失了。然后一切又渐渐朝上长，长，长，种子长成树苗，树苗长成大树，组成森林。荆棘和蕨类植物蔓延开来，也来帮忙。腐叶土累积起来又被冲刷掉，冬天河水猛涨时挟带来的泥沙淤积起来。时光流逝，我们的家园重又准备好了，我们就搬了进来。在我们上面，在地面上，也发生了同样的事情。动物们来了，喜欢上了这块地方，占了自己的地盘，安顿下来，扩展繁衍。他们不为过去烦恼──从不，他们太忙了。这地方起伏不平，有不少土丘，自然就到处是洞穴。不过这倒是一件好事。他们也不为将来操心──怕将来有一天人类会搬回来──住一段时间──这是很有可能的。野树林现在人丁兴旺，什么样的动物都有，好的、坏的、中不溜丢的──我不指名道姓。世界就是各式各样的动物组成的。不过，我猜想，到如今你对他们有些了解了吧。”

“我算是了解啦。”鼹鼠莫尔说，微微打了个寒战。

“嗨，得啦，”獾子班杰拍拍他的肩膀说道，“你瞧，这是你第一回领教他们。其实他们并不是那么坏。我们都得活，也让别人活。不过明天我会到处放话出去，我想，今后你不会再遇到麻烦了。只要是我的朋友，在这地界都可以随便走动，否则我就得查清楚原因！”

他们回到厨房的时候，发现水鼠兰特正焦躁不安，来回踱步。地下的气氛使他感到压抑，让他精神紧张。他好像真的害怕如果自己不照看着，河流就会跑掉。所以他已经披上外套，把手枪插回到了腰带里。“赶快，莫尔，”一见他们，他就着急地说，“我们得趁着白天，赶快离开。不想在野树林再过一夜了。”

“没问题，好伙计，”水獭奥特说，“我和你们一块儿走，蒙上眼睛我也认识每一条路。如果谁的脑袋欠揍，你们放心，我会好好揍它一顿。”

“你完全不用烦躁，鼠仔，”獾子班杰平静地补充道，“我的通道比你想象的要长。在好几个方向，我有直达树林边缘的逃生出口，只是我不喜欢人人都知道罢了。你真的非走不可时，可以从我这些近道中抄一条离开。走之前，你不如放松一下，再坐一会儿。”

水鼠兰特还是急着要走，要回去照看他的河。于是獾子班杰重新拿起灯笼，领着他们走进一条潮湿憋闷的通道。它曲曲弯弯、水淋淋，一部分是拱廊，一部分是在顽石中凿出来的。他们走了很累人的一段距离，好像有几英里长，终于，透过纠结在一起悬在通道出口处的枝叶藤蔓，见到了迷糊零碎的日光。獾子班杰匆匆地跟他们道了别，急不可待地把他们推出洞口，用藤蔓、灌木和枯叶把它遮好，尽可能让一切看上去很自然，然后退了回去。

他们发现自己正站在野树林的边缘，身后是石头、荆棘和树根零乱地堆积和纠结在一起；前方是一大片宁静的原野，镶着一道道树篱，黑黝黝的与白雪交相辉映；前面更远的地方，那条熟悉的老河闪着光，冬日的太阳红红低低地悬在地平线上。认识每一条路的水獭奥特，充当起这一小群动物的头儿，领着他们沿一条最短的路线疲惫缓慢地向远处一道栅栏门前进。到那里后，他们休息了片刻，回头望去，只见野树林黑压压一大片，密密层层，阴森险恶，嵌在广袤的白色原野中间，面目狰狞。他们不约而同地回过头来，快快地赶路，奔回家去：奔向炉火和炉火映照下的熟悉的物件，奔向窗外那欢快的声响。发出声响的是那条河，他们了解并信任它的所有禀性，它从不作怪搞鬼，让他们害怕。

鼹鼠莫尔一路匆匆地跑，急切地期盼着回到家的一刻，急切地要回到他熟识和喜爱的事物中间。这时他明白过来了，他是一只属于耕地和树篱的动物，同他连接在一起的是犁沟，是他常常光顾的牧场，是他黄昏时分流连不去的林荫小路，是种着庄稼的田园。严寒的天气，顽强的忍耐，真格地同粗犷的大自然冲突交锋，那是别人的事。他得聪明些，他得守着那舒适的地界──他的命运就安排在那里，那地方自有它的刺激和奇遇，足够他消遣一生。





第五章　家园之乐[1]


绵羊杂乱地挤在一起，向羊栏跑去。他们仰着脑袋，喷出薄薄的鼻息，细细的前蹄跺着地面。淡淡的水汽从拥挤的羊圈里升腾起来，弥散在寒冷的空气里。两只动物兴高采烈、有说有笑地匆匆从旁经过。他们正穿过乡间回家去：长长一整天，他们都跟奥特在野外，在水边高地上打猎、探险。他们那条大河的几条支流的细细的源头就在那高地上。冬日短暂的白昼将尽，暮色正合拢来，但他们仍有一段路要赶。刚才脚步沉重、缓慢地穿过无路的耕地时，他们听到羊的声音，就赶了过来。现在，他们发现有一条脚爪踩出来的小径从羊圈通出去，走在上面感觉松快多了。对这个小小的鼓舞，所有小动物的内心都拥有的某种天赋作出了反应，它明白无误地在说：“是的，一点没错，这条路通向家！”

“我们好像来到了一个村庄。”鼹鼠莫尔放慢脚步，稍带迟疑地说。那条脚爪踩出来的小径，没多久变成了小道，然后又扩展成一条林荫小路，现在把他们交付给了一条碎石铺面的大道。两只动物受不了村庄，而他们时常在上面过往的那几条公路自有独立的走向，与教堂、邮局和酒店毫不相干。

“哦，没关系的！”水鼠兰特说，“一年里的这个季节，他们全都太太平平待在家里，坐着烤火。男人、女人、孩子、狗儿、猫儿，全都是。我们悄悄地溜过去就行了，不会招惹麻烦、遇到不快。如果愿意，可以透过窗户瞧他们一眼，看看他们在干什么。”

十二月中旬的夜幕降得那么快，一下子把小小的村庄全笼罩住了。他们踏着初雪的一层薄薄的雪粉，蹑手蹑脚走上前去。除了街道两旁昏暗的橘红色方块以外，几乎什么也看不见。一幢幢村舍的火光或者灯光，透过那些方块窗扉，流溢到外面黑魆魆的世界里。那种低矮的格子窗多半不挂窗帘，窗内的人围坐在茶桌旁，或者专心致志地做手工，或者有说有笑，还做着手势。在窗外的看客眼中，都各有一种给人带来快乐的魅力。这种魅力正是演艺纯熟的演员的终极追求──完全意识不到观众存在，自然而然表现出来的一种魅力。两个离开自己家那么远的观众，随心所欲从一家剧院跑到另一家。当他们看到一只猫儿被人抚摸，一个瞌睡的孩子被人托起来拥在怀里送上床，一个疲倦的男人伸个懒腰，在一根燃烧的木头一端磕空烟斗时，他们的眼睛里流露出了伤感。

但最让人心跳的是一方小小的窗户。窗帘拉上了，夜色中它只是一方透着光的空白。它透出一种家的感觉。四墙围护、帷帘遮屏的一方小天地，把外面自然界那个有压力的大世界隔开了，忘却了。紧靠白色窗帘挂着的一只鸟笼在窗户上映出一个清晰的剪影，笼子的每一根栖木、每一道铁丝、每一样配件，甚至在昨日被舔圆了边角的那块方糖，都清晰可辨。中央那根栖木上，那个毛蓬蓬的占有者，把脑袋塞进了羽毛里。它好像离他们很近很近，仿佛抬起手就能很容易地抚摸到似的。甚至他蓬起的羽毛的细尖尖，都清晰地映画在那块发光的屏幕上。他俩正看着，那瞌睡的小家伙不安地动了一动，醒了。他抖抖身子，抬起头。他们看得见他的张开着的小小的喙。他懒洋洋地打了个哈欠，看看四周，然后又把脑袋扭到背后，埋进翅膀里，竖起的羽毛也渐渐地收拢来，最后完全静止不动了。这时，一阵刺骨的寒风刮进他们的后脖颈，冰凉的雨夹雪刺痛了皮肤，使他们如梦初醒，意识到自己脚趾冰冷，两腿发酸，离家还有很长很累的一段路。

出了村庄，突然一下子就不再有村舍了，透过黑暗，他们又嗅到路两边亲切的田野气息。他们打起精神，踏上最后一段漫长的归途。这是回家的路，这路，我们知道，迟早走到尽头。到时门闩喀嚓一响，炉火突然映入眼帘，各种熟悉的物件迎候着我们，那情景就像迎接久别后从遥远海外归来的游子。他们默默而坚定地行进着，各自想着自己的心事。鼹鼠莫尔满脑子都是晚饭。夜色漆黑一片，在他心目中，这是完全陌生的乡间，他把领路这件事完全交给水鼠兰特，乖乖地尾随着他。水鼠兰特按照习惯走在前头一小段，双肩耸起着，两眼紧盯着前面笔直、灰暗的道路。所以呀，当那个召唤突然触到可怜的莫尔，像电击一样击中他时，兰特没有注意到。

我们这个与众不同的种类，已经失去敏锐的生理感觉很久了，甚至已经没有适当的词汇来表达动物和环境──周围有生命的或无生命的事物──之间息息相通的关系。例如，我们只有“嗅觉”这一个词来概括整个系列的微妙刺激，它们却日日夜夜在动物鼻子里嗡动着，表示召唤、警告、挑逗、排斥。正是这样一个来自虚空的神秘的、仙乐一般的呼唤，突然透过黑暗触动了莫尔。那感召激得他浑身一遍遍地颤栗，多么熟悉哦，虽然他一时还不能清楚地记起那究竟是什么。他一下子就完全定住了，用鼻子使劲儿地向各处搜寻，想捕捉住那根细丝、那道传达信息的电流，它那么强烈地触动了他。只一会儿，他就重新捕捉到了它。这一回，记忆的洪流随着它蜂拥而来了。

家！这就是那信息的含义。那亲切的感召，那从空中飘来的温柔的触摸，那些又拉又拽的看不见的小手，全都来自同一个方向！唔，那一刻，它一定近在咫尺，他的老家：他第一次发现大河那一天就将之匆匆丢下，再没有回过的家！现在，它派探子和信使出来，要捉他回去了。自从在那个欢快明媚的早晨逃离后，他几乎连想也不曾想到过它。他沉浸在新生活里，陶醉在各种乐趣、奇遇、新鲜感和吸引人的体验之中。现在，往日的记忆涌上心头，在黑暗中，家，那么清晰地呈现在他眼前！它确实破旧狭小，陈设简陋，可那是自己的家，他自己动手建造的家，每天工作结束后回到里面那么幸福。很明显，家也喜爱他。它正想念着他，盼他回去。它正通过他的鼻子，对他诉说这一切，带着哀愁，带着责备，但并不怨恨，并不生气。它只是凄楚地提醒他，它就在这里，它想他。

这呼叫清清楚楚，这召唤明白无误。他必须立刻服从，立刻前去。“鼠仔！”他充满了欢乐，激动地喊道，“停下！回来！我需要你，快停下！”

“哦，跟上，莫尔，来呀！”水鼠兰特欢快地答道，继续吃力地向前走。

“求求你停下，鼠仔！”可怜的莫尔央求道，他心里面痛苦极了，“你没明白我的意思！这是我的家，我的老家！我刚刚发现了它的气味，它就在附近，真的非常近。我一定得去，一定，一定！哦，回来，鼠仔！求求你，求求你回来！”

这时水鼠兰特已经在前头好远。太远了，听不清鼹鼠莫尔究竟在喊些什么；太远了，分辨不出他嗓音中那尖利的声调、痛苦的吁求。他的心思在天气上，因为他也嗅出了一点什么，好像快要下雪了。

“莫尔，现在我们不能停，真的！”他回过头来喊道，“我们明天来吧──已经很晚了，而且马上又要下雪，这条路我还拿不准！我需要你的鼻子，莫尔，所以快跟上来吧，你可是个好伙计！”水鼠兰特不等莫尔回答，只管奋力向前赶路。

可怜的莫尔独自一人站在路上，他的心碎了，在他心底里，一汪酸泪正在聚积着，聚积着。他知道它就要一涌而出，尽情宣泄。但即使面临这样的考验，他对朋友的忠诚依然毫不动摇。他片刻也不曾有过抛弃兰特的念头。可同时，老家飘送来的信息在向他嘀咕、恳请、祈求，最后专横地下了拥有他的结论。他不敢再在它们的魔力圈子里停留下去了。他猛地挣断心弦，把脸冲着前方的路，顺从地追随着水鼠兰特的踪迹。可那微弱的淡淡的气味，仍然朝着他那竭力逃避的鼻子穷追不舍，责备他麻木不仁，有了新朋，忘了旧友。

他费了好大劲儿才赶上兰特。兰特一点都没生疑心，开始愉快地唠叨起回家后该干些什么，客厅里生起一炉柴火会多么让人快活，他准备吃一顿怎样的晚饭。他丝毫没留意到同伴心中痛苦，没留意到他沉默不言。不过，最后，当他们走了相当长一段路，经过紧贴着道路的一片杂树林边缘的几个树桩时，他停下来，好心地说：“喂，莫尔老家伙，你好像累坏了。你一声不吭，两只脚拖着走好像灌了铅似的。我们在这里坐一分钟，歇一歇吧。到现在雪还没有落下来，我们已经走了一大半路了。”

鼹鼠莫尔凄凄惨惨地一屁股坐在树桩上，竭力克制着自己，因为他感觉到自己真的要哭出来了。他已经跟那一汪酸泪斗了很久，可它就是不肯认输。它一个劲儿地往上，往上，硬要冒出来，一点一点又一点，其余的一股脑儿飞快地往上涌。最后，可怜的莫尔放弃了抗争，不管不顾、止不住地放声痛哭起来，因为他知道，一切都完了，那个很难说已经找到的东西，他已经失去。

莫尔突然哭得死去活来，让水鼠兰特又惊讶又沮丧，有一会儿竟不敢开口说话。最后，他平心静气、深表同情地说：“怎么啦，老伙计？究竟怎么回事？把你的苦恼说出来吧，看我能不能帮帮你。”

可怜的莫尔说话很困难，他的胸膛不停地剧烈起伏着，阻碍他说话，话到嘴边也被噎住。“我知道它……破旧……脏……地方小，”他终于呜呜咽咽、断断续续地说出来了，“比不上……你的舒服住处……托德的漂亮府第……班杰的大屋子……可那是我自己的小家……我喜欢它……我跑出来，把它忘得一干二净……可我突然嗅到它了……在路上，我叫你，可你不听，兰特……我一下子全想起来了……我想念它！……天哪，天哪！……你不肯往回走，鼠仔……我只好丢下它，可我一直嗅到它的气味……我觉得心要碎了……原本可以过去看一眼的，鼠仔……只看一眼……就在附近……可你不肯往回走，鼠仔，你不肯往回走！天哪，天哪！”

回忆卷起了新的悲伤浪潮，泪水再一次完全占据上风，哽噎得他说不下去了。

水鼠兰特两眼直直地看着前面，一言不发，只是轻轻地拍着莫尔的肩膀。过了一会儿，他忧郁地咕哝道：“现在我全明白了！我是一头多蠢的猪啊！一头猪──就是我！我就是一头猪──十足的一头猪！”

他等着，等莫尔的哭泣渐渐缓和下来，变得有节奏些。他等着，等到最后，莫尔只是在抽鼻子了，哭泣变得断断续续。这时他站起来，漫不经心地说：“嗨，我们最好还是接着走，老家伙！”边说边迈步，沿着他们刚才辛辛苦苦走过来的路，原路往回走。

“你（呃）去哪里（呃），鼠仔？”莫尔吃惊地抬起头来，满脸泪花，喊道。

“我们去找你的家，老伙计，”水鼠兰特愉快地答道，“所以你最好一起来，要费点事呢，需要你的鼻子。”

“哦，回来，鼠仔，快回来！”鼹鼠莫尔嚷道，站起身来急忙追了上去，“没用的，我跟你说！太晚了，天太黑，那地方离这里太远，而且快下雪了！还有──我绝不是有意要让你知道我对它感情那么深──这完全是个意外，一个错误！想想河岸吧，还有你的晚餐！”

“去他的河岸和晚餐！”水鼠兰特诚心诚意地说，“我告诉你，我一定要找到那地方，哪怕在外面待一夜。打起精神来，老家伙，抓住我的胳膊，我们很快就会回到那里的。”

莫尔仍然在抽鼻子，他央求着，不大情愿地让专横的伙伴把自己拽上了回头路。兰特滔滔不绝地给他讲趣闻逸事，好让他恢复情绪，高兴起来，好让令人疲惫的路途显得短些。终于，他们来到了水鼠兰特觉得肯定是莫尔“耽搁下来”的那段路附近，他说：“好了，别说话了。干活儿！用上你的鼻子，用心找。”

他们默默地走了一小段路，突然，水鼠兰特从他挽着莫尔的那条胳膊觉察到一道微弱的电流，它震颤着流过那动物的身体。他立刻松开自己的胳膊，退后一步，聚精会神地等待着。

信号来了！

莫尔僵立了片刻，翘起的鼻子微微颤动着，嗅着空气。

接着他短促地向前跑几步──错了──猛地止步──回头再试；然后慢慢地、稳稳地、充满信心地向前。

水鼠兰特很是兴奋，神态像个梦游者似的，紧跟着鼹鼠莫尔。他们跳过一条干沟，钻过一道树篱，在微弱的星光下，靠鼻子嗅着，越过了一片开阔、无路、光秃秃的田野。

突然，莫尔毫无征兆地一头钻了下去。不过，水鼠兰特一直很警觉，立刻就跟着他下了地道──莫尔那准确无误的鼻子忠实地引领着他，找到了它。

地道又窄又闷，土腥味很重，兰特觉得过了好长时间才到达它的尽头。他们站直了，伸一伸胳膊，抖一抖身子。鼹鼠莫尔划着了一根火柴。借着火光，水鼠兰特看见他们正站在一块打扫得干干净净的空地上，脚下铺着沙子，脸正对着莫尔家那扇小小的前门，门旁悬着拉铃绳，门上方嵌着哥特体字母。

莫尔走到墙跟前，从一根钉子上摘下一盏灯笼，把它点亮。水鼠兰特瞅着四周，看到他们所在的地方像是前院。门的一旁放着一张花园长椅，另一边有一个石滚子。鼹鼠莫尔在家时是个爱干净的动物，不能容忍别的动物在他的地面上踢出一道道痕，堆成一个个小土堆。围墙上挂着铁丝花篮，里面种着些蕨类植物。花篮之间安着托架，托架上放着石膏塑像──加里波第、婴儿撒母耳、维多利亚女王，还有另外一些意大利当代英雄[2]。前院一侧有个九柱戏场子，场子边上有一排长凳，还有一些刻着圆圈圈的小木桌，那些圆圈是放啤酒瓶的位置。院子中间是一个圆形的小池塘，池子边上镶着一圈鸟蛤贝壳，池子里面养着金鱼。池子中央矗立着一座形状新颖奇特的建筑，它四周嵌着更多的鸟蛤贝壳，顶上安着一颗银白色的大玻璃球，映在上面的每一样东西都变了形，很好玩。

这些物件那么亲切，一下子映入眼帘，让莫尔脸上放出光来。他催促着兰特赶快进门，在门厅里点亮一盏灯，扫视了一下他的旧家。只见到处都积了厚厚的灰尘，长时间没人料理的屋子里一片清冷凄凉的景象，房间狭小，陈设破旧──他又一次崩溃了，两只爪子捂着脸，一屁股瘫坐在门厅里的椅子上。“鼠仔呀！”他凄凄惨惨地哭道，“我干吗这样做哟？干吗在这样一个夜晚，带你来到这个又冷又小的破地方，此时此刻你本可以待在河边的家里，在旺旺的炉火前烤你的脚指头，周围尽是你那些讲究的摆设！”

水鼠兰特没理会莫尔的自怨自艾。他在屋子里跑来跑去，打开一扇扇门，检查房间和橱柜，点亮许多灯和蜡烛，各个地方都摆放上一个。“顶顶好的一座小屋！”他兴高采烈地嚷嚷道，“那么紧凑！安排归置得多好！样样都不缺，样样都在合适的位置！今晚我们会过得很快活的。第一件需要做的事是生一炉旺火，这事我来办，我找东西是最内行的。这就是客厅？棒极了！把那些小铺位安在墙上是你自己想出来的吗？顶顶好的主意！嗨，我去搬木柴和煤，你去找个掸子，莫尔──厨房的桌子抽屉里肯定有的──把屋子稍微弄整洁些。快忙起来，老家伙！”

令人振奋的同伴让鼹鼠莫尔受了鼓舞，他站起身，用力又用心地开始掸灰擦垢。水鼠兰特抱来满满一抱柴火，跑前跑后，很快就生着了火，欢乐的火苗呼呼地直蹿烟囱。他招呼鼹鼠莫尔过去暖暖身子。可莫尔立刻又是一阵沮丧，他绝望透顶地跌坐在一张长椅上，把脸埋在掸子里。“兰特，”他呻吟道，“你的晚饭怎么办呢，你这个又冷又饿又累又可怜的动物？我没东西给你吃，什么也没有，面包屑也没有！”

“你这家伙，咋这么容易投降哟！”水鼠兰特责备道，“嗨，就是刚才，我清清楚楚看到厨房碗柜里有一个开沙丁鱼罐头的起子。人人都知道，哪里有起子，哪里附近就有沙丁鱼罐头。振作起来！打起精神，过来和我一起找找。”

他们就照着法子去找，搜遍每一个柜子，拉开每一只抽屉。结果当然没有预料的好，但也不算太让人沮丧──沙丁鱼一罐，船长饼干[3]一盒，差不多是满的，还有包着银纸的德国香肠一根。

“够开宴席了！”水鼠兰特一边摆饭桌，一边评论道，“我敢说，有些动物，如果让他们坐下来和我们一起吃晚饭的话，要他们干什么都行！”

“没有面包！”鼹鼠莫尔忧伤地叹息道，“没有黄油，没有……”

“没有肥鹅肝酱饼，没有香槟！”水鼠兰特咧开嘴笑着，接口说道，“说到这个我想起来了──过道底那扇小门里面是什么？当然是你的酒窖！这屋子里什么奢侈品都有了！等我一分钟。”

他向酒窖门走去，很快就走了回来，身上沾了点灰尘，两只爪子里，两只胳膊下，各夹着一瓶啤酒。“看来你是个挺放纵自己的乞丐，莫尔，”他评论道，“一样也不戒。这小屋子真是我到过的最快活的地方。这些墙画你从哪里弄来的？这么一贴，太有家的气氛了。怪不得你那么喜欢这个家呢，莫尔。说来听听，布置得这么好，你是怎样办到的。”

水鼠兰特忙着去拿盘子和刀叉，还有调和蛋杯要用的芥末。这时候，鼹鼠莫尔开讲了。因为刚才情绪激动的缘故，他的胸脯还在起伏。起先他还稍微有些不好意思，但是越往下说，就越放得开了──这是怎样设计的，那是怎么想出来的。这是从姑姑那里得来的飞来横财，那可是个淘换来的宝贝，而且买的是便宜货。这一件却是“省吃俭用”好些时候，辛辛苦苦攒钱买来的。说到最后，他的情绪完全恢复了，一定要去抚摸一下他的财物。他拿起一盏灯，向客人展示它们的特点，详详细细地解说一遍，完全忘了他们俩都迫切需要的晚餐。兰特饿极了，却努力掩饰着，一会儿严肃地点点头，一会儿皱起眉头仔细端详，有机会插言评说时，还不时说上一句“真棒”、“好不寻常哦”什么的。

水鼠兰特终于把他诱骗到了桌饭旁边。真的要打开沙丁鱼罐头时，他们突然听到前院里有声音，像是一只只小脚在石子儿上扭来扭去的声音，还有一片杂七杂八的细细的嘀咕声。他们能断断续续地听到只言片语──“好啦，站成一排……汤米，把灯笼稍微举高点……先清清你们的嗓子……我报过‘一二三’后不要再咳嗽……小比尔在哪里？……过来，快，我们都在等你……”

“发生什么事了？”水鼠兰特停住手，问道。

“肯定是田鼠，”鼹鼠莫尔答道，神态中有一丝得意，“每年这个时候，他们都会按规矩到处走动，唱圣诞颂歌。在我们这一带，这差不多已经成习俗了。他们从来不漏掉我，最末一个到这里。唱到莫尔家结束。我总是请他们喝热饮料，如果供得起，有时还请他们吃晚饭。如今又听到他们的声音，就好像回到了过去的时光。”

“去看看他们吧！”水鼠兰特嚷道，跳起来，向门口跑去。

门一打开，映入眼帘的是一幅可爱的冬令景象。前院里，一盏牛角灯笼的昏暗光线，照亮了站成半圆形的十来只小田鼠，他们脖子上围着红色精纺羊毛围巾，前爪深深地插在衣兜里，两只脚跳着吉格舞取暖。他们亮晶晶的小圆眼睛羞怯怯地互相瞟着，偷偷地笑几声，吸吸鼻子，又盯着自己的外衣袖子好一阵子。门开的时候，那个年龄大些提着灯笼的，正在喊：“预备，一、二、三！”空中立刻就扬起了他们尖细的声音。他们唱的是一首古时候的颂歌，是他们的祖先在结了冰霜的休耕农田里，或者在大雪封住了烟囱拐角的时候创作的，[4]一代代传下来，每逢圣诞时节，在泥泞的街道上，对着亮灯的窗户歌唱。





圣诞颂歌





众位乡亲，对着冰霜寒潮，

请敞开你们的家门，

虽然有风跟着，有雪沾着，

还是请我们进去烤烤火吧，

欢乐将属于你们，在早晨！





我们跺着脚呵着手指头，

站这里冒雨雪顶寒风，

远道而来向你们致意──

你们在炉边我们在街头──

祝欢乐属于你们，在早晨！





因为在前半夜过去之前，

引导我们来的一颗星

会突降如雨的喜乐福祉──

赐福明朝，赐福来日，

赐欢乐给每一个早晨！





善人约瑟夫[5]跋涉在雪中

看见那颗星低垂马厩上空；

玛丽[6]不用再前行，迎着她

茅草屋顶在上，褥草在下！

欢乐属于她，在那天早晨！





于是他们听见了天使的声音：

“是谁第一个欢呼圣诞？

是所有动物，因为圣婴降临

是在他们所居住的马厩！

欢乐将属于他们，明天早晨！”





歌声停止了，歌手们有些羞怯，但喜气洋洋，和旁边的人交换着眼色。接下来是一片寂静──但只有一会会儿。接着，从上方的地面上，从遥远的地方，透过他们不久前刚经过的地道，一阵嗡嗡嗡的微弱音乐声传到他们耳边，那是远处的钟声在叮叮当当地鸣响着欢乐。

“唱得真好，孩子们！”水鼠兰特热情地喊道，“进来吧，大家都进来，烤烤火暖暖身子，吃点热乎的东西！”

“是啊，快进来，田鼠们，”鼹鼠莫尔急忙喊道，“还像过去一样！随手关上门。把那张高背长椅拖到炉火前面。现在，稍等一分钟，等我们──哦，鼠仔！”他绝望地嚷道，一屁股坐下，眼泪都快掉下来了，“究竟怎么办呢？我们没东西给他们吃！”

“全交给我吧，”兰特说道，好像他才是主人，“喂，那个拿灯笼的！过来，我有话问你。嗯，告诉我，晚上这个时候还有商店开着门吗？”

“嗯，当然有，先生，”田鼠恭敬地答道，“每年这个时候，我们这里的商店任何时候都开门。”

“那好，你听着！”水鼠兰特说，“你立刻出去，带上灯笼，给我……”

接着他们又嘀咕了一阵子，鼹鼠莫尔只零零星星听到几句，比如，“记住，要新鲜的！……不，那个一磅就够了……一定要买布金斯家产的，别的我都不要……不，只要最上等的……如果那一家没有，就换一家试试……对，当然，要自制的，罐装的不要……就这样，你尽力而为吧！”最后是硬币叮叮当当从一只爪子递到另一只爪子里的声音，田鼠接过一只很大的购物篮子，就提着灯笼急匆匆地出门了。

其余田鼠在高背长椅上坐成一排，小腿儿悬空，晃荡着，尽情享受炉火，把他们的冻疮直烤到发痒。鼹鼠莫尔想引着他们轻轻松松地交谈，没成功，就大讲起家史来，要他们逐个儿报出自己众多弟弟的名字。看来那些弟弟们年龄太小，今年还不让出来唱圣诞颂歌，不过呀，料想得到，父母批准的那一天很快就会来到的。

这时水鼠兰特正忙着察看啤酒瓶上的标贴。“我看出来了，这是老伯顿牌的，”他赞许地评论道，“好有见地的莫尔！就要这个牌子的！现在可以来加些调料做热麦芽酒了！把东西准备好，莫尔，我来拔软木塞。”

没多大工夫，就把酒调好了，装在锡壶里，把它深深地塞进炉子中央最红的炭火中间。不一会儿，田鼠们一个个都啜着、咳着、呛着（因为调制的麦芽酒哪怕一点点，劲儿也够大的），一边擦眼睛，一边呵呵地笑，忘了自己这一辈子挨过冷受过冻。

“这些小家伙还会演戏呢，”鼹鼠莫尔向水鼠兰特介绍说，“全是他们自己编，自己演。演得还真不错！去年他们演了一出顶顶好的戏，说一只田鼠在海上被巴巴里海盗[7]抓住了，被强迫在一艘战舰上划桨。他逃脱了。回到家乡时，他的情妹妹已经进了女修道院。嗨，你！当时你参加演出的，我记得。站起来，背一段台词来听听。”

被点到的田鼠站了起来。他羞怯地咯咯直笑，眼睛在屋子里瞟了一圈，舌头却依然像打了结，憋不出一句词儿。同伴们给他加油，莫尔哄他鼓励他，水鼠兰特甚至不惜抓住他的肩膀摇晃他。但无论怎么弄，也克服不了他的怯场心理。大家围着他忙得团团转，就像一群船工，按照皇家溺水者营救会的章程，抢救一个长时间溺水的人一样。正在这时，门栓咔嗒一响，门开了。打灯笼的田鼠出现在门口，沉甸甸的篮子压得他脚步蹒跚。

篮子里实实在在的内容一倒在桌上，演戏的话题马上就被忘到了九霄云外。在兰特指挥下，人人动手，或者干活儿，或者去取东西。短短几分钟，晚饭就准备好了。莫尔像做梦一样在餐桌主位上坐定时，看到刚刚还空荡荡的桌面现在已经排满了美味佳肴；看到小朋友们脸上放光，片刻也不耽误，马上就开始吃了起来。其实他自己已经饿极了，于是也放开肚皮，享受那些魔术般变出来的食物。他边吃边寻思，这次回家，最后居然变成了这么快乐的光景。他们边吃边聊，说些往事，田鼠给莫尔说了些本地最近的小道消息，还尽其所知，回答了他询问的上百个问题。水鼠兰特几乎不说话，只管照料着客人们各自想吃什么吃什么，多吃多喝，让莫尔丝毫不用操心费神。

最后响起了一片杯盘刀叉放下的叮当声，田鼠们要走了。他们说了很多声谢谢，还有像雨点一样的节日祝福；出门时，上衣口袋里塞满了带回家给弟弟妹妹的纪念品。门在最后一个小客人身后关上，灯笼上的叮当声渐渐消失了。莫尔和兰特就把火拨旺，把椅子拉到炉火跟前，给自己斟上最后一杯调制麦芽酒作为睡前饮料，议论几句这长长的一天里发生的事情。最后水鼠兰特打了个大大的哈欠，说道：“莫尔，老家伙，我要倒了。简直不能用犯困这个词儿来形容。那边一张床铺是你自己的吧？好的，我就睡这一张了。这小屋子多妙啊！每一样东西都是伸手就够得着！”

他爬上床铺，把自己裹在毯子里，马上就进入了梦乡，就像一捆大麦被搂进了收割机的怀抱中一样。

疲倦的莫尔也很乐意立刻上床睡觉，他的脑袋很快就挨到了枕头上，一颗心沉浸在无比的快乐和满足之中。但是他在合上两只眼睛之前，让它们在他的老房间里巡视了一遍。在炉火的映照下，这房间那么的温馨柔和；火光停留在每一样物件上，在上面嬉戏。不知不觉中，这些熟悉而亲切的物件早已成了他自身的一部分，现在正微笑着迎接他归来，毫无怨言。他现在的心境，正是机智的兰特想要悄悄地引他进入的那一种。他很清楚，家里的一切有多么平凡简朴，甚至很狭小；但他也明白，家对自己有多么重要，这样一个港湾，对一个人的生存具有何等特殊的价值。没错，他丝毫也不想抛弃新的生活和灿烂广阔的新天地，不想离开阳光、空气和它们呈现给他的一切，爬回来，守在家里；上面的世界吸引力太强大了，即使他目前身处地下，也仍然在召唤他，他知道自己必须回到那个更大的舞台上去。不过，心中知道有这样一个家可以回，这有多好啊。这地方完全属于他自己，这些物件重新见到他时总是喜笑颜开，永远可以指望它们这样率真地欢迎他归来。

第六章　托德先生


这是初夏一个晴朗亮丽的早晨。大河两岸已经复原，河水恢复了惯常的流速。热热的太阳，仿佛用千万根金线，把万物从土中拽起来，拽出来，迎向自己；让它们变绿，变茂密，生出尖刺。鼹鼠莫尔和水鼠兰特天刚亮就起床了，忙着干一些与船有关联的活儿，为正在到来的行船季节做些准备。比如上清漆和油漆，修理船桨，修补坐垫靠垫，把不见了的带钩船篙找出来，等等。这时候他们在小客厅里，已经快吃完早饭，正在热烈地讨论当天的计划，忽然门上响了一记很重的敲门声。

“麻烦！”水鼠兰特说，满嘴都是鸡蛋，“看看是谁，莫尔，好小伙子，你已经吃完了。”

鼹鼠莫尔出去应门，水鼠兰特听到他发出一声惊喜的大叫。接着客厅的门猛地打开了，莫尔郑重其事地通报：“班杰先生到！”

獾子班杰来正式拜访他们，或者更确切地说，拜访任何人，都实在是一件了不得的事。如果你非常想见他，一般只有一大清早，或者黄昏将夜时分，在灌木树篱旁等候着，趁他悄没声地溜过去时，同他碰个正着。要不然就得到野树林中央他家里去找他，那可是一件非同小可的事。

獾子班杰脚步很重，他大步走进屋子，然后站在那里，一脸严肃，看着两只动物。水鼠兰特不由自主把蛋勺掉在桌布上，大张着嘴呆坐在那里。

“时间到了！”獾子班杰终于极其庄重地说道。

“什么时间？”水鼠兰特瞟着壁炉台上的钟，很不自在地问。

“你应该问是谁的时间，”獾子班杰答道，“嗨呀，是托德的时间！托德的时间到了！我说过，冬天一过去，我就要接手管教他，今天我就是来管教他的！”

“托德的时间，当然！”鼹鼠莫尔高兴地嚷道，“万岁！我想起来了！我们要把他教导成一个明智的托德！”

“昨晚我从可靠的消息来源获悉，”獾子班杰在扶手椅里坐下，接着说道，“就在今天上午，又有一辆马力特大的新汽车会送到蛤蟆府试用，不满意可退货。也许，此时此刻，托德正忙着打扮自己，穿上他心爱的那套奇丑无比的服装。托德的模样本来还不错（相对而言），一穿上那身行头，就成了个怪物。只要是头脑还好使的动物，不小心遇见他，都会狂晕。我们得趁早忙活起来，不然就太迟了。你们二位马上陪我去蛤蟆府，完成拯救工作。”

“说得对！”水鼠兰特一跃而起，嚷道，“我们去拯救那不幸的可怜动物！我们要把他改变过来！他得彻底洗心革面，要不然我们就跟他一刀两断！”

他们上路了，去完成他们的善举。班杰在前面带路。动物结伴出行时，总是采取一种适当的、合理的方式。他们排成一列纵队，而不是杂乱无序地横在路上，不然的话，如果突然遇到麻烦或危险，就无法互相支援了。

来到蛤蟆府的马车道上时，他们发现，果然像獾子班杰预料的那样，一辆簇新锃亮的汽车，很大的个头，漆成鲜红色（托德最喜爱的颜色），正停在宅子前面。他们走到门口时，大门正好猛地打开来。托德先生鼻子上架一副护目镜，头戴便帽，脚上套着长筒橡胶靴，身披一件奇大无比的外套，一边大摇大摆地走下台阶，一边拽上他那副长长的皮革驾驶手套。

“哈啰！快来，伙计们！”他一眼就看到他们，兴高采烈地嚷道，“你们来得正是时候，同我一起去快快活活地──快快活活地──快……快……呃活……”

注意到朋友们一言不发，一个个脸上冷冰冰的，表情严厉，他原本热情洋溢的语调顿时变得结结巴巴，邀请还没说完就没了声音。

獾子班杰大步走上台阶。“把他弄进去。”他坚决果断地对同伴们说道。托德挣扎着抗议着，被推搡到门里面去了。班杰则转过身来，对着那个把新车开来的司机。

“恐怕今天不需要你了，”他说，“托德先生改变了主意。请你理解，这是最终决定。你不必等了。”说完他随着其他人走进去，关上了门。

“行啦！”他对癞蛤蟆托德说道，这时他们四个都站在大厅里，“首先，把这一身可笑的玩意儿卸了！”

“不行！”托德回嘴道，劲头十足，“你们这样粗暴地对待我，什么意思？我要求你们马上给个解释。”

“那好，你们两个替他脱。”獾子班杰简短地命令道。

托德一个劲儿地踢着踹着，叫骂出各种难听的话。他们不得不把他摁倒在地板上，否则没法好好干活儿。水鼠兰特坐在他身上，鼹鼠莫尔一点一点剥下他那身驾驶服，然后让他重新站直。一身讲究的行头卸下之后，他那股子狂风暴雨式的劲儿好像消失了一大半。现在他只是托德了，不再是公路煞神。他只能无力地咯咯笑着，求饶似的看看这个又看看那个，好像完全明白了自己的处境。

“你知道迟早会有这一天的，托德。”獾子班杰严厉地解释道。

“你把我们的警告都当成了耳旁风，一直不断地挥霍你父亲留下的钱财。你开车狂飙，撞坏多少东西，还跟警察争吵，在这个地区败坏了我们动物的名声。特立独行没什么不好，可我们动物决不允许自己的朋友干蠢事出丑超过一定的底线。你已经触到这个底线。现在，你在许多方面还是个不错的家伙，我不想对你太狠。我将再做一次努力，让你恢复理智。你跟我到吸烟室里去，听我给你讲讲你都干了些什么。我们来瞧瞧，你从里面出来时，是否还是进去之前那个托德。”

他牢牢地抓住托德的胳膊，把他拽进吸烟室，随手关上了门。

“那白费力气！”水鼠兰特不屑地说，“找托德谈话，是治不好他的毛病的。你说什么他都会答应。”

他们舒舒服服地坐在扶手椅里，耐心等待。透过关着的门，他们只能听见獾子班杰嗡嗡的话音长时间响个不停，声浪一会儿高一会儿低。不久，他们就注意到，班杰的说教时不时地被拉长的呜咽声打断，那明显是从托德的心底里发出来的，他是个软心肠、重感情的动物，很容易──眼下，暂时地──被任何观点左右。

大约过了三刻钟，门开了，獾子班杰用爪子牵着一个没精打采的托德很庄重地走了出来。托德浑身的皮像口袋似的耷拉着，两条腿打着颤，腮帮子上挂着一道道泪痕，那是被獾子班杰的动人演说勾出来的。

“坐那里，托德。”獾子班杰指着一张椅子，和蔼地说。“朋友们，”他接着说道，“我很高兴地告诉你们，托德终于认识到自己走错了路。他真诚地为过去的错误思想和行为感到懊悔，答应永远彻底地放弃玩汽车。他向我作出了一个带有这种意思的郑重承诺。”

“这真是个好消息。”鼹鼠莫尔很认真地说。

“确实是个好消息，”水鼠兰特半信半疑地评论道，“只要──只要──”

他这样说的时候，非常严厉地看着托德，心里忍不住觉得，从那只动物仍然悲伤的眼睛里，仿佛看到有一种东西隐约闪了一下。

“只要再做一件事就行了，”欣慰的班杰接下去说道，“托德，我要你当着你这两位朋友的面，把刚才你在吸烟室里对我满口答应的话，再郑重其事地重复一遍。首先，你是不是为过去的所作所为感到懊悔，认识到那完全是一种愚行？”

很长很长的停顿。托德绝望地看看这边又看看那边，其他动物则一言不发，严肃地等待着。他终于开口了。

“不！”他说，语气有些抑郁，但毫不妥协，“我不懊悔。那根本不是愚行！那就是很光荣的！”

“什么？”獾子班杰喊道，非常非常震惊，“你个出尔反尔的动物，刚才在里面你不是对我说……”

“哦，是啊，是啊，在里面，”托德不耐烦地说，“在里面我什么都会说。你那么有口才，亲爱的班杰，那么感人，那么有说服力，把你的大道理摆得头头是道──在里面你对我可以想怎样就怎样，你知道的啦。可事后我绞尽脑汁，把事情全部捋了一遍，发觉自己其实一点都不懊悔或后悔，所以非要说我懊悔可是一点好处也没有的。喏，是不是？”

“那就是说，”獾子班杰说道，“你不答应不再碰汽车？”

“当然不答应！”托德断然地回答道，“正相反，我说话算数，看见一辆汽车，噗——噗！我就上去开走！”

“我不是早就这样跟你说过吗？”水鼠兰特对鼹鼠莫尔说。

“那好吧，”獾子班杰站起身来，斩钉截铁地说，“既然好说好劝你不听，我们就来试试武力管不管用。我一直担心会走到这一步。托德，过去你经常邀请我们三个过来，和你一起住在这所漂亮房子里。好吧，现在我们就照办。哪一天把你的脑筋搞正常了，我们就离开，不到那一天不走。你们二位把他弄上楼去，把他锁在卧室里，然后我们几个把事情安排一下。”

托德又踢又蹬，拼命挣扎着，被两位忠实的朋友拖上楼去。“你知道这是为你好，蛤蟆仔，”水鼠兰特和蔼地说，“想想看，等你熬过这一关，治好这场痛苦的疯病，我们大家又会像以前一样一起玩，那多开心！”

“在你病好以前，我们会好好地为你照管一切，托德，”鼹鼠莫尔说，“我们会好好当心，不让你的钱像以前那样被糟蹋掉。”

“不再发生不幸事件交警方处理，托德。”水鼠兰特说，这时他们正把他塞进卧室。

“不再一连几个礼拜住医院，被女护士呼来喝去，托德。”鼹鼠莫尔一边补上一句，一边转动钥匙把他锁在了里面。

然后他们下楼，任由托德透过锁孔冲着他们高声叫骂。然后三位朋友开会，讨论目前的局势。

“这件事要拖很长时间呢，”獾子班杰说，叹了口气，“我从没见过托德这样死心塌地。但我们无论如何也要坚持下去，把事情完成。得时时刻刻有人看着他。我们轮班陪他，直到他身上的毒自己排完为止。”

他们按照这个办法排好了班。晚上每个动物轮流睡在托德的房间里，白天也分班看守。刚开始时，对这几个小心谨慎的守卫来说，托德的确是个很难对付的家伙。疯劲儿一上来，他就会把卧室里的椅子排成形似汽车的样子，蹲在最前面那张椅子上，向前弓着身子，眼睛直盯着前方，嘴里发着很难听的噪音。最后达到高潮时，他会完整地翻一个筋斗，趴倒在东倒西歪的椅子中间，暂时显得心满意足。不过，随着时间的推移，这种痛苦的发作次数越来越少了。他的朋友们也千方百计让他分心，把注意力转移到新的渠道里去。可他好像就是不能对其他事情产生兴趣，很明显地变得没精打采、萎靡不振了。

一个晴朗的早晨，轮到水鼠兰特值班。他上楼去把班杰换下来的时候，发现班杰烦躁不安，急着要出去。班杰想去树林，到地下洞穴里溜达一大圈，伸展伸展胳膊腿。“托德还赖在床上，”他站在门外，告诉水鼠兰特，“从托德嘴里掏不出几句话，他只说什么‘哦，别理我，我什么也不要，也许过一会儿我就好多了。过一段时间症状会渐渐消失的，不用太着急’之类。哎，你得留神，兰特！托德安安静静，温温顺顺，装出一副主日学校获奖小明星的模样时，就是他最狡猾的时候。肯定会出花招的。我了解他。哟，现在我得走了。”

“今天你还好吗，老家伙？”水鼠兰特走到托德床边，高高兴兴地问道。

他等了好几分钟才听到回答。一个虚弱无力的声音终于回答道：“非常感谢你，亲爱的鼠仔！你真好，想着问问我！可还是先告诉我，你自己好吗，优秀的莫尔好不好？”

“哦，我们都很好。”水鼠兰特答道。“莫尔嘛，”他很不谨慎地多嘴道，“他跟班杰一起出去溜达了。他们俩要到午饭时候才回来，所以，今天上午只有你我两人一起快快乐乐地打发时间，我会尽量让你开心的。快从床上跳起来吧，乖小伙子，这么好的早晨，别愁眉苦脸躺在那里！”

“亲爱的，好心肠的兰特，”托德喃喃地说，“你对我的情况了解得太少，现在我离‘跳起来’还差得远呢──即使有一天真能做得到！不过，别为我费心啦。我不愿成为朋友们的累赘，料想也不会很久了。真的，我希望不会。”

“嗯，我也希望不会，”水鼠兰特诚心诚意地说，“这段时间你害得我们好苦，听到你说就要结束了，我真高兴。这么好的天气，划船季节刚刚开始！你太不像话了，托德！倒不是我们嫌你麻烦，可你弄得我们错失了好多好多机会。”

“不过，恐怕你们还是在嫌麻烦呢，”癞蛤蟆托德有气无力地回应道，“我完全能理解。这很自然，你们为我费心劳神很多，已经厌倦了。我不能要求你们再为我做什么。我是个大麻烦，我知道。”

“是啊，你确实是，”水鼠兰特说，“但我告诉你，只要能让你变成一个明智的动物，再怎么麻烦我也愿意。”

“既然你这样说，鼠仔，”托德比先前更虚弱了，他喃喃地说，“我求你──可能是最后一次了──求你尽快跑个来回，去村子里──即使马上就去也可能已经太迟了──把医生请来。还是别让你费心了吧。不必白白添麻烦了，也许还是听天由命的好。”

“嗨，你要医生做什么？”水鼠兰特问道。他凑到近前，仔细察看着托德。托德当然是一动不动地平躺着，声音比先前更虚弱，模样变了很多。

“最近你一定注意到──”托德喃喃地说，“不──为什么你就该注意到呢？注意到一些事只会找来麻烦。明天，是啊，也许你会对自己说：‘唉，要是我早注意到就好了！要是我当时做点什么就好了！’可是不用了，不必添麻烦。你别介意，把我的请求忘了吧。”

“听着，老哥们儿，”水鼠兰特说，开始有了几分惊慌，“如果你真的需要，我当然会把医生请来。可你还不至于病到那种程度吧。我们来聊聊别的事情。”

“亲爱的朋友，”托德带着悲哀的笑容说道，“对我这样一个病人来说，恐怕‘聊聊’是起不到什么作用的──而且，恐怕医生也不一定有用。不过，就算是一根稻草也要抓住吧。顺便提一下，既然你准备去，不介意同时也请律师过来一趟吧？我不愿另外再给你添麻烦，可我偶然想起来，你会经过律师门口。那样我能省一点事。有一些时刻──也许我该说有一种时刻，人必须面对不愉快的差事，不惜代价，哪怕耗尽生命！”

“要找律师了！哦，他一定病得很重！”受了惊吓的兰特对自己说。不过，他急急忙忙走出房间时，并没有忘记随手把门仔细锁好。

到外面后，他停下来想了想。另外两位都不在旁边，没有人可以商量。

“还是保险一点好，”他沉思着自言自语道，“托德无缘无故凭空想象自己病重得要命，这种事以前倒也碰到过，可从来没听他说要请律师！如果没有大碍，医生会对他说他是头老驴子，让他振作起来，那倒也是个收获。最好还是迁就他一下，去就去吧，花不了很长时间的。”于是他跑向村子，办他的慈善差事去了。

一听到钥匙在锁孔里转动的声音，癞蛤蟆托德就轻轻一跳下了床。他一直在窗口焦急地注视着兰特，直到他在马车道的尽头消失。然后，他一边纵情大笑，一边尽快地行动起来。他把眼下能找到的最漂亮时髦的衣服穿上，又从梳妆台的一个小抽屉里拿了许多现金塞满衣袋，紧接着，将床上的床单、被单系在一起，临时做成一根绳子，一端系在窗子中间那根竖框上──那富丽堂皇的都铎式[1]窗户可是他卧室的一大特色──爬出去，轻轻地滑落到地上。然后他吹起曲调欢快的口哨，朝着与水鼠兰特相反的方向，无忧无虑地扬长而去。

对兰特来说，那一天的午饭时间是黑色的。獾子班杰和鼹鼠莫尔终于回来了，他不得不在餐桌上面对他们，讲他那令人同情却难以置信的故事。獾子班杰的一番刻薄甚至可以说冷酷的评论，那是可以想象的，所以就不提了。可让水鼠兰特痛苦的是，连鼹鼠莫尔也发话了。他虽然尽可能站在朋友一边，也忍不住说道：“这一回你可有点犯浑了，鼠仔！托德也是，没有动物比他再浑了！”

“他装得太邪乎了。”兰特垂头丧气地说。

“他把你骗得太邪乎了！”獾子班杰火气很大地重新加入了谈话，“不过，光动嘴巴是于事无补的。不用说，眼下他肯定已经跑远了。最糟糕的是，他自作聪明，自高自大，什么蠢事都做得出来。唯一感到安慰的是，现在我们自由了，不必再浪费宝贵的时间给他放哨。但我们最好继续在蛤蟆府睡一段时间。托德随时都可能让人给弄回来──放在担架上，或者夹在两个警察中间。”

话虽这么说，獾子班杰并不知道将来会发生什么事，不知道要有多少水，多么混浊的水，从桥下流过，托德才会重新自在安逸地坐在他祖传的府宅里。





此时此刻，轻松愉快、不负责任的托德，正轻快地在公路上走着，已经离家好几英里。起先为了躲避追踪，他走小路，过田野，还换过几次路线。可现在，他觉得已经没有被抓回去的危险了：太阳在欢快地对着他微笑，整个大自然都加入了一支颂歌的合唱，那是他的心正对他自己唱着的一首自我颂扬的歌。他心里面全是满足，脑子里全是自负，几乎是一路走来一路跳舞。

“干得真漂亮！”他咯咯地笑着对自己评论道，“智力和暴力对决，智力更棒，这是必然的。可怜的老鼠仔！啊呀呀！獾子班杰回来时他不得挨一顿骂！一个挺出色的家伙呀，鼠仔，长处不少，可就是没什么智慧，完全没受过教育。将来有一天，我得管教管教他，看看能不能把他教出点名堂。”

他满脑子都是这种自高自大的念头，一路昂首阔步地走来，到了一座小镇。只见主街的半道上，一幅“红狮”幌子，横过街道，飘飘荡荡地悬着。他这才记起来自己没吃早饭，还走了这么长的路，顿时觉得饿到了极点。他大步走进那家客栈[2]，叫了一份招牌名称如此之短的客栈所能提供的最好的午餐，坐在咖啡室里吃起来。

他刚吃一半就听见一个太熟悉太熟悉的声音，正沿着大街由远及近。那声音使他一个激灵，浑身颤抖起来。噗——噗！越来越近。听得出那辆汽车拐进客栈的院子，停了下来。托德不得不抓住桌子腿来掩饰自己控制不住的冲动。不一会儿，那伙人就走进了咖啡室。他们很饿，很健谈，轻松愉快、喋喋不休地谈论着那天上午他们的经历，还说起了一路顺顺当当把他们载过来的那辆车子的优点。托德如饥似渴、全神贯注地听了一阵子，终于再也忍不住了。他悄悄地溜出咖啡室，到柜台上付了账，一出门，就不声不响地转悠到了客栈院子里。“不会有害处的，”他对自己说，“我只是瞧一瞧！”

汽车停在院子中间，根本没人看管，马夫和其他随从们都在里边吃饭。托德慢悠悠地围着它转，审视着、评点着、沉思冥想着。

“不知道，”他就自言自语地说，“不知道这种车子发动起来容易不？”

片刻之后，也不知道是怎么发生的，他发现自己的手握在车门把手上，正在转动它。随着那熟悉的咔嗒一声响，往日的激情一下子攫住托德，主宰了他的身心。像在梦中一样，他发现自己不知怎么就坐在驾驶座上了；像在梦中一样，他拉动操纵杆，绕着院子开了一段，穿过拱门驶了出去；像在梦中一样，对对和错的判断，对明摆着的后果的恐惧，一时间都仿佛飞到了九霄云外。他加快了速度，车子从街上一啸而过，跃上公路，然后便穿行在空旷的乡间了。这时他脑子里只有一个意识，那就是他又做回托德了：处在最佳状态巅峰时刻的托德、煞神托德、大路的霸主、小路的君王，见到他人人都得让路，否则就给你重重一击，让你灰飞烟灭永不再见天日。他一边飞驰，一边哼唱，那车子也嗡嗡地轰鸣着，响应他的歌声。好多英里在他的车轮下消失，他只知疾速向前，不问它驶向何方。他在满足本能，及时行乐，不管它后果如何。





“我看，”首席地方法官兴致勃勃地评述道，“这个案子其他各方面的案情都很清楚，唯一的困难在于，对我们面前这个在被告席上畏缩成一团的疑犯、屡教不改的流氓、顽固不化的恶棍，怎样才能让他充分领略到难受的滋味。让我想一想：现在已经可以认定他有罪，事实清楚，证据确凿──第一，偷盗昂贵的汽车；第二，驾车危害公众；第三，对乡村警察粗野无礼。书记员先生，请告诉我们，对于上述各项犯罪行为，可以判处的最严厉的处罚是什么？当然，不能给犯人任何无罪假定的权利，因为不存在证据不足的问题。”

书记员用钢笔挠了挠鼻子。“有人认为，”他评述道，“偷盗汽车是最严重的犯罪行为，确实如此。但是，对警察言语无礼，无疑可处以最重的处罚，应该如此。假如说对盗窃罪判得轻些十二个月，对野蛮驾驶罪判得宽大些三年，对冒犯警察罪判十三年──根据我们从证人席上得到的证词，即使只相信十分之一的证词，我本人从来最多只相信十分之一，那也是一种十分严重的冒犯──那么上述数字如果正确地加在一起，总共就是十九年……”

“好极了！”首席法官说。

“……所以您最好凑个整数，二十年，这样比较保险。”书记员总结道。

“极好的建议！”首席法官赞许地说，“犯人！打起精神来，站直了。这一次判你二十年。记住，如果下一次你再出现在我们面前，只好重重地判你了！”

紧接着，粗暴的法警们向倒霉的托德扑过去，给他戴上了镣铐。他尖叫着、祷告着、抗议着，被拖出了法庭。他们拖着他穿过市场，市场上那些爱戏弄人的百姓，对只遭到通缉的嫌犯，一向给予同情和帮助，可对已经定罪的罪犯，总是很苛刻的。他们挖苦他，向他扔胡萝卜，高喊流行口号。他们拖着他走过嘘嘘地起哄的学童，学童们看到一位绅士陷入困境，总是能从中得到些快乐，天真的小脸上放出光来。他们拖着他从发着沉闷声响的吊桥上走过，从布满钉刺的吊闸下钻过，从阴森森的古堡中那条凶巴巴的拱道下穿过──那些古老的塔楼可是高耸入云呢。他们经过警卫室，警卫室里挤满了不当班的军士，军士们冲着他咧开嘴直乐。他们经过咳嗽的哨兵，哨兵的咳嗽含讥带讽，让人难受至极，因为值班哨兵顶多只敢这样来表示对罪犯的轻蔑和厌恶。他们拖着他上了几段年久失修的螺旋式阶梯，从穿着钢盔甲的士兵身旁走过，士兵们从面甲后面射来威胁的目光。他们穿过院子，院子里的猛犬绷紧了脖子上的皮带，爪子向空中乱抓，想扑他。他们经过几个老古董看守，那些看守把戟靠在墙上，面前放着一个肉馅饼和一壶棕色麦芽酒，正打瞌睡。他们拖着他走啊走，走过拉肢刑讯室和拇指夹刑讯室，走过通往非公开断头台的岔路口，最后来到这个最幽深的看守所中心这一间最阴森的地牢门口。门前坐着一个老古董狱卒，正用手指转动着一串又大又重的钥匙。在这里，他们终于停了下来。

“他奶奶的！[3]”警官说，他摘下头盔，擦了擦额头，“起来，你个老潜鸟，把这个坏蛋癞蛤蟆接管过去。他可是个罪大恶极、狡猾无比、机敏过人的罪犯。把你的本事都拿出来，把他给看好喽。你可给我听仔细了，白胡子老头，要是出了什么意外，就拿你的老脑袋瓜子抵他的脑袋──两个脑袋都要遭瘟！”

狱卒阴冷地点点头，把他那只干枯的手放在了不幸的托德肩上。生锈的钥匙在锁孔里嘎吱一响，巨大的牢门就在他们身后哐当一声关上了。于是，在欢乐英国从东到西、从南到北最坚固的城堡中，托德成了最偏远、最戒备森严的地牢里一名无助的囚犯。

第七章　黎明之门前的吹笛人


柳莺躲在河岸那幽黑的镶边里，正唱着他尖细轻柔的歌。虽然已过晚上十点，天空依然把已逝白昼之光的裙边抓在手里，紧扯着不放。在短暂的仲夏之夜那凉凉的手指触摸搅动下，炎炎的午后郁结着的暑气已经破开，翻滚着散尽了。莫尔正伸开四肢躺在河岸上。那一天，从黎明破晓到日落黄昏，没见过一丝云彩，酷热至极，压得他现在仍然气喘吁吁。他在等他的朋友回来：白天他一直跟另外几个伙伴待在河上，放了水鼠兰特一马，让他赴约去见奥特，那是他俩之间一个长期有效的约定。可他回去时，却发现屋子里黑黑的空无一人，不见兰特的影。他肯定是和老伙伴待在一起不想走了。天还是太热，屋子里待不住，所以莫尔躺在凉爽的酸模草叶子上，把这一天经历的事回想了一遍，觉得全都很棒。

不一会儿就听见水鼠兰特的脚轻轻落在热烘烘的草地上，越走越近的声音。“好凉快哦，真舒服！”他说，然后坐下来，若有所思地凝视着河水，一言不发，入了神。

“你肯定在那边吃过晚饭了吧？”鼹鼠莫尔就问。

“简直没办法，”水鼠兰特说，“我要走，可他们听也不想听。你知道他们一向待人很好的。他们使出浑身解数让我高兴，直到我走的那一刻。可我一直觉得不忍心：虽然他们拼命掩饰，可是我看得很清楚，他们很不快乐。莫尔呀，恐怕他们遇上麻烦了呢。小胖又丢了，你知道他父亲心里有多疼他，虽然嘴上从来不说。”

“什么，那孩子？”鼹鼠莫尔轻飘飘地说，“嗨，就算丢了，又有什么可担心的？他老是自个儿跑出去。丢了，又找到了。他太喜欢冒险啦，但是从来不曾出过事。这附近人人都认识他，喜欢他，就跟喜欢老奥特一样。放心吧，说不定哪只动物碰上他，把他送回家，就万事大吉了。嗨，我们自己就遇到过他。离家好几英里，他一点也不慌张，开心得很呢！”

“没错，可这一回比较严重，”水鼠兰特语气沉重地说，“他已经丢失好几天，奥特一家人到处找遍了，没发现一丝一毫的踪迹。他们还问遍了方圆几英里以内的每一只动物，可没人知道一丁点他的消息。奥特明显着急得很，只是不肯承认而已。我从他那里打听到，小胖的游泳学得还不是很好。我看得出来，他是想到拦河坝那地方了。一年中的这个时节，坝那里仍然有许多水往下流，孩子们总是对那地方很着迷。还有，那里有……嗯，陷阱之类的东西──你知道的啦。奥特不是那种没到时候就很紧张儿子的人。可现在他真的很紧张。我走的时候，他出来送我──说是想透透气，还说什么伸展伸展腿脚。但我看得出来，根本不是那么回事。所以我引他开口，把他好一顿盘问，最后把实话套出来了。他要去浅滩，整夜守着。昔日里，桥造起来之前，大家一向都是从老浅滩那里过河的，那地方你知道吗？”

“我很熟悉，”鼹鼠莫尔说，“可奥特为什么偏偏要选那地方守着呢？”

“嗯，好像，他正是在那里给小胖上第一次游泳课的，”水鼠兰特接着说道，“因为那里有个沙嘴，它靠近河岸，水很浅，有很多碎石。那里也是他经常教他捕鱼的地方，小胖的第一条鱼就是在那里捉到的，那是他很自豪的一件事。孩子爱那地方，奥特心想，如果他从不知什么地方游荡回来──如果此时此刻可怜的小家伙还在这世界上的话──可能会直奔他非常喜爱的浅滩。还有，如果他偶然经过那里，想起好多事情，也许会停下来玩。所以奥特每天夜晚去那里守着──抱着一线希望，你知道的哦，只是抱着一线希望！”

他们沉默了一会儿，两人都在想同一件事──漫漫长夜里，那个孤独、伤心的动物，蹲在那边浅滩上，通宵守候着，等待着──抱着一线希望。

“算了，算了，”水鼠兰特就说，“我觉着我们该回去了。”却没有一点动弹的意思。

“兰特，”鼹鼠莫尔说道，“虽然好像没什么可干的，但不干点什么，我实在没法回去，也睡不着。不如把船弄出来，向上游划。再过个把小时月亮就要出来了，那时我们就可以尽力搜索一番。不管怎么说，总比什么也不干就回去睡觉强。”

“我也是这样想的，”水鼠兰特说，“不管怎么说，这样的夜晚睡不睡的无所谓。离天亮也没多久了，到时候我们可以一边找，一边向早起的人打听他的消息。”

他们把船弄了出来，水鼠兰特操桨，小心地划着。河的中流现出一条清亮狭窄的航道，隐隐约约地倒映着天空。但是水中凡是有河岸、灌木和树的影子的地方，那些影子全都像岸上的原物一样，黑糊糊连成一片。所以，鼹鼠莫尔掌舵时必须好好看清楚。夜那么黑，那么寂寥，但黑暗中充满了各种细微的声响：歌声、唠叨声和一些窸窸窣窣的动静。这些声响透露出小不点族群起来活动了，在干他们的营生。他们会通宵达旦地忙碌，直到阳光照到身上，送他们应当应分地去休息。河水本身的声音也比白天更清晰可辨，它的咕噜声和扑哧声更显得突如其来，仿佛近在咫尺。时不时地，突然一声响，吓他们一跳，仿佛是谁清清楚楚叫了他们一声，那声音真的非常清楚。

地平线很清晰，对天空寸步不让。在一个特定的方向，一片银白色的磷光不断升高，渐渐扩展开来，衬得地平线格外黑。终于，在一直期待着的大地边缘，月亮雍容华贵地慢慢升了上来，最后纵身一跃，脱开地平线悬浮在空中，没有了羁绊。他们又开始能看清地面了──宽广的草地、静谧的花园、两岸之间的河面，全都柔柔地展现在视野里。神秘恐怖的气氛一扫而空，夜色明亮如同白昼，但又与白昼大大不同。他们常去的老地方又在迎候着他们，但换了一身打扮，仿佛它们曾悄悄溜走，换上这一身皎洁的新装，又悄没声地溜回来，含羞带笑地等待着他们，想看看他们是否还认得出来。

两个好朋友把船拴在一棵柳树上，上了岸。他们来到这寂静的银色王国，耐心地搜索着树篱、中空的树、一条条小河与河沿上的一个个小涵洞，还有壕沟和干涸的河道。然后他们又上船，划向大河对岸。他们就这样来来回回往上游一路找下去。那一轮宁静安详的月亮悬在无云的空中，虽然离得那么远，也在尽力帮他们搜寻。最后，她的时间到了，只好很不情愿地沉向地平线下方，离开了他们。于是，神秘氛围再一次笼罩住了田野和大河。

然后，一种变化开始慢慢地显露。地平线变得更清晰了，田野和树木变得越来越分明，而且不知为什么变了模样。笼罩它们的神秘气氛开始退去。忽然，一只小鸟尖叫了一声，又寂静无声了；蓦地起了一阵微风，吹得芦苇和香蒲草沙沙作响。莫尔在划桨，待在船尾的兰特突然坐直了身子，聚精会神地倾听着。莫尔一边很轻地划着，只让船不停下来，一边仔细扫视着岸上。这时，他不由得好奇地看着莫尔。

“听不见了！”水鼠兰特叹息道，重新陷进了座位里。“多么美，多么新奇哟。消失得那么快，还不如没让我听见呢。那声音在我心里唤起了一种痛苦的渴望：只要能再听一回，一直永远地听下去，别的什么都好像无所谓了。不！又来了！”他喊道，再一次凝神倾听起来。他听得入了迷，着了魔，很长时间默默不语。

“它在往前移，我快听不见了，”没多会儿，他就说，“莫尔啊！太美了！那么愉快，沸腾着喜悦，那遥远的笛声的呼唤呢，纤细、清晰、快乐！做梦也想不到有这样的音乐，想不到笛声会有那么甜美，更想不到笛声里的召唤有那么强烈！划呀，莫尔，快划！那音乐和召唤一定是为我们而来的。”

鼹鼠莫尔非常非常纳闷，但他服从了。“我什么也没听见，”他说，“只听见风从芦苇、灯芯草和柳树枝条中间吹过的声音。”

水鼠兰特就算听到了他的话，也没有回答。他全神贯注、情不自禁、浑身颤抖，全身心都被这新的神圣事物占有了。它抓住了他不由自主的灵魂，晃悠着、颠动着，像一只强有力的手托着一个无力但幸福的婴儿。

莫尔默默地、平稳地划着，不久，他们来到大河的分流处，一条长长的回水河汊在这里向一侧岔开。兰特早丢下舵索了，这时就轻轻地歪了歪脑袋，示意划桨手让船走回水河汊。曙光之潮悄无声息，不断地推进着，现在他们已经能看清像宝石一样镶嵌在水边的花儿的颜色。

“越来越近，越来越清晰了，”水鼠兰特快乐地嚷道，“现在你肯定听见了吧！啊──终于──看得出来你听见了！”

那欢畅的笛声的清流，向鼹鼠莫尔奔涌过来，像浪涛一样拍打着他，一下子把他卷住，完全占有了他。他透不过气来，呆若木鸡，停止了划桨。他看见了同伴脸颊上的泪水，他低下头来，理解了。好一会儿，他们待在那里一动不动，任凭那流苏一样缀饰着河岸的紫色千屈菜拂弄着。接着，伴随着那醉人的旋律，清晰而不容违逆的召唤来临了。它把自己的意志强加给莫尔，使他又弯下腰，机械地划起桨来。光不断变得更明亮，但是黎明临近时本该唱起来的小鸟一个也不出声，除了那天籁，万物都静得出奇。

他们继续向前划行。那个早晨，两岸丰美的河边草甸，清新翠绿得无与伦比。他们从来不曾发现玫瑰有这样鲜艳，柳兰有这般绚烂缤纷，绣线菊会弥漫出如此沁人的芬芳。这时，正在逼近的拦河坝发出的嗡鸣声渐渐占领上空，他们感觉到自己正在接近终点──无论它是什么，肯定在那里等待着他们结束这次远足。

那巨大的拦河坝，用泡沫和闪光做成一个宽阔的半圆形臂弯；用碧水形成的闪亮的双肩，从左岸到右岸，封住了回水河汊，在平静的水面上搅起一个个飞旋的漩涡，一串串漂浮的泡沫；用它那庄严而抚慰人心的轰鸣，盖住了所有别的声音。在拦河坝波光粼粼的臂抱里，在水流的中央，停泊着一座小岛，岛的边缘密密地缀着一圈柳树、白桦树和桤树。它有些矜持，有点害羞，但蕴含丰富；它把它所拥有的一切都藏在一层面纱后面，等待既定时间的来临。时间到了，才向应召而来的被选中者坦承。

在一种庄严的期待中，两只动物缓慢但毫不迟疑地划过动荡起伏的水面，把船停靠在小岛那鲜花盛开的岸边。他们默默地上了岸，穿过花丛、芳香的草丛和灌木丛，来到平地上，在一片小草坪上面停住了脚。这是一片绿得神奇的草坪，环绕着它的是大自然自己的果园──沙果树、野樱桃树和黑刺李树。

“这是我的梦中曲之乡，是那音乐演奏给我听的地方，”水鼠兰特悄声说道，仿佛在催眠状态中，“如果世上有一个地方我们肯定会找到他，那就是这块圣地！”

鼹鼠莫尔突然感觉到一种非凡的敬畏感袭来，摁下他的头，把他浑身的肌肉变成了水，使他的脚在地上生了根。那不是恐慌──其实他感到出奇的平静和快乐──那是一种把他摄住、攫紧的敬畏感。不用看他就知道，那只能意味着一个令人敬畏的神灵近在咫尺。他艰难地转过身去找他的朋友，看见兰特就在他身边，诚惶诚恐，剧烈地颤抖着。四周栖满小鸟的树枝上依然悄无声息，天光仍然在变得越来越明亮。

也许他本不敢抬起眼睛，此刻，笛声虽已沉寂，召唤却似乎依然居高临下、不容违逆。即使死神本人正等着他，一旦他用肉眼看了那正正当当地隐藏着的事物就立刻把他击倒，他也不会抗拒那召唤。他颤抖着服从了，抬起谦卑的头。这时，大自然的脸上辉映着不可思议的色彩，她仿佛为正在发生的事屏住了呼吸──黎明正在临近，在无比澄澈的曙光里，莫尔看着朋友与救助者的眼睛。他看见那对向后弯曲的犄角在渐渐增强的日光中闪亮；看见一双慈祥的眼睛正诙谐地俯视着他们，中间是一只刚毅的鹰钩鼻，一丝笑意绽放在长胡须的嘴角。他看见一条鼓着一道道肌肉的胳膊搁在宽阔的胸前，修长柔韧的手中仍握着刚从唇边拿开的那支潘神之笛[1]；看见曲线完美、长满绒毛的双腿威严而悠然地摆放在草地上。最后，他看见他的两只蹄子中间依偎着圆滚滚、胖乎乎、年幼、稚气的小水獭──他一副平和安然、心满意足的模样，睡得正酣。在紧张得透不过气来的这一瞬间，莫尔看到了所有这一切，在清晨的天空映衬下，如此生动。他看见了，所以他还活着；他活着，所以他仍然感到惊讶。

“兰特！”他颤抖着，缓过气来，轻轻地问道，“你害怕吗？”

“害怕？”水鼠兰特喃喃地说，眼睛里闪烁着难以形容的爱的光芒，“害怕！怕他？哦，不，决不！不过……不过……哦，莫尔，我还是有点怕！”

两只动物匍匐在地，俯首膜拜。

突然，太阳那辉煌灿烂的大金盘出现在他们对面的地平线上了。最初的光线从浸在水中的平坦草甸子上射过来，晃得两只动物满目阳光。等他们重新能看见时，那幻象已消失了，空中充满了小鸟赞颂黎明的歌声。

他们茫然地凝视着，渐渐意识到刚才看见的一切和所失去的一切，同时越来越深地陷入一种说不出的惆怅之中。这时，一阵变幻莫测的微风，旋舞着从水面上刮起，撩拨着山杨树，摇晃着含露的玫瑰花，轻轻地、爱抚地吹拂着他们的脸；一经它那轻柔的触摸，他们立刻就忘掉了一切。这正是那现身相助的仁慈的半神[2]，心细体贴，最后赠送给他们的最好礼物：遗忘──以免那使人产生敬畏之心的记忆滞留、滋长，给欢笑和愉悦蒙上阴影；以免那异乎寻常的记忆萦绕在心头，损害这些被他救出困境的小动物的后半生。这礼物是要让他们像以往一样幸福快乐、无忧无虑。

莫尔揉揉眼睛，瞪着茫然四顾的兰特。“对不起，刚才你说什么，兰特？”他问。

“我想，我刚才只不过是说，”兰特慢吞吞地说道，“如果有地方能找着他的话，肯定就是这种地方，就在这里。瞧！呵，他就在那边，那小家伙！”他高兴地大喊一声，向沉睡中的小胖奔去。

但莫尔又站在那里发了一会儿呆。恍如一个人突然从美梦中醒来，努力回忆着，却什么也回想不起来，只隐隐约约地感觉到它的美，美极！最后，那一丁点感觉也渐渐消失了，做梦的人只好悲惨地接受冰冷严酷的梦醒，连同它所有的惩罚。莫尔正是这样，他和他的记忆搏斗了一阵子，然后伤心地摇摇头，追随水鼠兰特而去。

小胖醒来了，吱吱地欢叫了一声，一看见父亲的两个朋友，又开心地扭了扭身子──要知道，过去他们经常逗他玩的。可是只一会儿，他就神色茫然，哀哀地啼号着，转圈寻找起来──就像一个孩子在保姆的怀抱里幸福地睡着了，醒来后发现自己孤孤单单躺在一个陌生的地方，搜遍了所有角落和橱柜，跑遍了一个个房间，无言中，心底里越来越绝望。就这样，小胖顽强地、不知疲倦地在岛上找来找去，直到最后完全没有希望的时候才放弃，坐在地上痛哭起来。

鼹鼠莫尔迅速跑过去安慰那小动物，可兰特却徘徊不去，久久地、满腹狐疑地看着草地上几个深深的蹄印。

“有一个……伟大的……动物……来过这里。”他若有所思、慢条斯理地嘀咕道，站在那里冥思苦想，苦想冥思，脑子里着很奇怪地翻腾着。

“快过来，兰特！”鼹鼠莫尔喊道，“想想可怜的奥特吧，他还在浅滩那里守着呐！”

小胖很快就被安抚好了，他们答应他一件乐事──乘坐兰特先生的真船在河上游览。两只动物领着他来到河边，把他妥善地安置在船底，夹在他俩中间，沿回水河汊往外划。现在太阳已经全部升上了地平线，照得他们暖洋洋的。小鸟无拘无束、精力充沛地歌唱着，花在两岸微笑着频频点头。可不知为什么，在两只动物心里，似乎就是刚才，在某一个地方，他们见到的花儿的色彩更加丰富，更加艳丽──在哪里呢？

又来到了主河道。他们掉转船头，逆流而上，向他们的朋友独自守夜的地点划去。离那熟悉的浅滩不远时，鼹鼠莫尔把船划到了岸边。他俩把小胖拎出船外，让他站在纤路上，命令他向前开步走，并亲切地拍了拍他的背道别，然后用桨一撑，把船驶到中流。他们看着那小动物摇摇摆摆、志得意满、煞有介事地沿着纤路往前走；他们一直看着小胖，直到看见他突然抬起鼻子，摇摆的步子一下子变成了笨拙的小跑。他加快了脚步，尖声哼唧着，扭动着身子，像是认出了什么。他们顺着大河向前望去，看见奥特神情紧张、身体僵硬，一跃而起，离开他一直默默地、耐心地蹲守着的浅滩，连蹦带跳从柳枝中间穿过，来到纤路上。他们听见他一路跑，一路又惊又喜地叫着。于是，鼹鼠莫尔重重地划了一桨，把船转过来，任凭满当当的河水载着他们重返下游──去哪里都行，他们的搜寻任务已经圆满完成了。

“奇怪，我觉得好累，兰特，”鼹鼠莫尔说，他疲惫地靠在桨上，任凭船在水上漂着，“也许你会说，我们整夜没睡，可这算什么呀。每年这时候，我们都是一礼拜有三四晚上不睡的。我说的不是这个，我觉得自己好像经历过一件惊心动魄的事，而且事情刚过去不久，可并没有发生过什么特别的事呀。”

“或许是一件惊人的、美丽辉煌的事，”水鼠兰特喃喃地说，闭着眼睛仰靠在船上，“我的感觉和你一模一样，莫尔。简直累得要命，可是身体并不累。真幸运，水流的方向帮着我们，送我们回家。太阳又晒到身上了，阳光透进人的骨头里，感觉真惬意！听，风在芦苇里吹曲呢！”

“像音乐──在很远的地方。”鼹鼠莫尔说，昏昏欲睡地点点头。

“我也正这样想呢，”水鼠兰特喃喃地说，懒洋洋像做梦，“舞曲──那种欢快的音乐，像流水一样没有停顿，但也是有歌词的，一会儿有一会儿没有，隔一会儿听到几句，然后又变成了舞曲，然后什么都没有了，只剩下芦苇在轻声细语地絮叨。”

“你耳朵比我好，”鼹鼠莫尔惋惜地说，“我听不见歌词。”

“让我试试，把歌词念给你听，”水鼠兰特仍然闭着眼睛，说道，“现在又变成有歌词的了，声音很轻，但很清楚──以免敬畏的感觉滞留不去……把快乐的嬉闹变成苦恼……在救助的时刻显我神力……事情过去就把它忘掉！现在轮到芦苇了──它们叹息着唱道：忘掉，忘掉。歌声渐渐消失，变成了沙沙沙、飒飒飒的声音。歌声又回来了──

“以免四肢撕裂被血染红……我松开设下的陷阱和捕机……松开它们时你们见我面容……因为你们一定会忘记！划近些，莫尔，离芦苇近些！很难听清楚，声音每分钟都在减弱。

“我是救助者和治疗者，我鼓励……潮湿林地里的小小流浪者……迷途者我寻回，受伤者我包扎……吩咐他们把这一切都忘记！近些，莫尔，再近些！不，没用了，歌声已经消失，变成了芦苇的低语。”

“可这些歌词是什么意思呢？”纳闷的莫尔问道。

“我不知道，”水鼠兰特简单地答道，“我听到什么，就传给你什么。啊！现在又来了，这一回又完整又清楚！终于，这一回，是实实在在的了，明白无误的了，朴素……热情……完美……”

“嗯，那我们就听听。”鼹鼠莫尔说，他已经耐心地等了好几分钟，被热烘烘的太阳晒得有些瞌睡了。

可是听不到回答。他望了一眼，明白了静默的原因。兰特脸上挂着非常幸福的笑容，仍然保留着倾听的神态，已经睡熟了。

第八章　托德的冒险


托德发现自己被监禁在一间阴冷发臭的地牢里，知道一座暗无天日的中世纪堡垒已将他和外面的世界隔开。不久前，他还在那个阳光普照、石子儿大路平坦通达的世界里，快快活活、尽情玩乐，仿佛全英国的每一条路都已经被他买下来似的。现在，他四仰八叉扑倒在地上，流着酸楚的泪，沉溺在悲观绝望之中。“一切都完了，”他说，“至少，托德的毕生事业完了，这反正是一回事。英俊的公众人物托德，富有而殷勤好客的托德，自由自在、无忧无虑、温文有礼的托德！我怎能指望有一天被放出去哟。”他说：“我冒冒失失偷了那么漂亮的一辆汽车，又异想天开、骇人听闻地冒犯了一大帮肥肥胖胖的红脸膛警察，坐牢是我罪有应得！”说到这里，他哽咽住了。“一个动物愚蠢到我这份上，”他说，“只有在这地牢里受苦了，到最后，那些曾经以认识我为荣的人们，连托德这个名字都会想不起来！哦，英明的老班杰呀！”他说：“哦，聪明的兰特和明智的莫尔呀！你们的判断力多么优秀，对人和事多么有见地！哦，不幸的、被遗弃了的托德！”他就这样日夜哀叹着过了好几个礼拜，不吃饭也不吃餐间小点心──虽然那个阴沉沉的老古董狱卒知道托德腰包里满满的，屡屡表示付出点代价就可以从外面弄进来好吃的东西，甚至搞些奢侈品。

却说那狱卒有个女儿，她是个可爱的村姑，心地善良，平时帮父亲在牢里干些比较轻的活儿。她特别喜爱动物，养了一只金丝雀。厚厚的牢墙上有一根钉子，白天她将鸟笼子挂在上面，把睡午觉的犯人吵得烦透了；晚上，她就把它放在接见室的桌子上，用椅子罩布盖住。另外，她还养了几只花斑鼠和一只不停转圈的松鼠。那好心肠的姑娘很同情托德的不幸，有一天，她对父亲说：“父亲！看到那可怜的动物那么不开心，瘦了那么多，我真受不了！你让我来管他吧。我有多么喜爱动物你是知道的。我要让他吃东西，亲手喂他，让他坐起来，做各种各样的事。”

父亲回答说，她想怎么摆弄托德都行。他已经厌烦托德了，厌烦他老是这样生闷气、犯贱，厌烦他那副神态。于是，那一天，她去做善事了，她敲了敲托德的牢门。

“嗨，打起精神来，托德，”她一边走进去，一边用好话哄他，“坐起来，擦干眼泪，做一个明智的动物。试试看，吃点午饭吧。瞧，我给你带来了我自己做的饭菜，热乎乎刚从炉子上端下来的！”

那是卷心菜煎土豆，扣在两个盘子中间。一股子香气，飘满了窄小的牢房。痛苦的托德俯卧在地上，卷心菜的气味直钻他的鼻子，使他一时间觉得生活也许并不像他自己想象的那么单调乏味、令人绝望。但他仍然哀嚎着，蹬着腿，不接受人家的安慰。于是，聪明的姑娘就暂时退了出去。当然，热卷心菜的许多气味留了下来，那是不用说的。在抽泣的间隙，托德嗅着嗅着，有了反应，脑子里渐渐地有了一些新的、鼓舞人心的念头：他想到了骑士精神、诗歌和他尚未完成的功绩；他想到了广阔的草甸子，草甸子上吃草的牛，牛的皮毛被阳光和风梳理着；他想到了菜园子、香草圃、不断被蜜蜂围攻的暖融融的金鱼草；还想到了蛤蟆府餐桌上摆放杯盘时那令人欣慰的叮当声，客人们一个个拉近椅子就餐时椅子脚擦地的声音。狭小的牢房里空气呈现出玫瑰色，他开始想念朋友们，想着他们肯定能做点什么；他想到了律师，想着当时他们一定很乐意接他的案子，自己竟那么驴，没有请上几位；最后，他想到的是他本人非凡的聪明才智，想着只要动动自个儿那伟大的脑袋瓜子，就能干成许多大事情。于是，他的心病差不多医好了。

几小时后，姑娘回来了。她端着一个托盘，托盘里放着一杯热气腾腾的香茶，还有一碟堆得高高的黄油烤面包，热乎乎的，切得很厚，两面都烤成了焦黄；黄油从面包孔里淌出来，滴成一粒粒金色的大珠子，像蜂巢里淌出来的蜜。黄油烤面包的气味简直是在对托德说话，并且声音毫不含糊。它讲述着温暖厨房；讲述着一个个明朗的结霜的清晨、一顿顿早餐；讲述着冬日黄昏漫游归来，穿拖鞋的脚搁在壁炉挡板上时，客厅的炉边有多么舒适；讲述着心满意足的猫儿的咕噜声，昏昏欲睡的金丝雀的啁啾声。托德重新坐直身子，擦干眼泪，开始小口喝茶，大口嚼面包。不久他就无拘无束地开始谈起他自己、他住的房子、他在家里做的事、他是怎样的一个大人物、他的朋友们有多么重视他。

狱卒的女儿看出来，这个话题和香茶一样，对他确实有益，就鼓励他继续往下说。

“给我说说蛤蟆府吧，”她说，“它好像很美呢。”

“蛤蟆府，”癞蛤蟆托德骄傲地说，“是一所称心如意、样样齐全的绅士住宅，出类拔萃。它部分始建于十四世纪，但是配全了各种现代设施。最新式的卫生设备。五分钟就到教堂、邮局、高尔夫球场，适合……”

“上帝保佑你这动物，”姑娘说道，笑了起来，“我又不是想买下它。给我说一些实际情况吧。不过，你先等一下，我再去给你拿点茶和烤面包。”

她轻快地走出去，一会儿就又端着一盘食物回来了。托德埋头猛吃烤面包，他的精神状况完全恢复到了平时那样。他给她讲停船棚屋、鱼塘、年代很久的带围墙的菜园子；给她讲猪圈、马厩、鸽棚和鸡舍；给她讲乳品屋、洗衣房、瓷器柜和放衣物的大壁橱（她特别喜欢这个）；给她讲宴会厅，讲许多动物来聚餐，他托德是又得意又神气，大家唱歌、讲故事、一起胡闹，玩得好开心。然后，她又要他说说他的动物朋友们，他讲了他们怎样生活，怎样消磨时光。他们的一点一滴，她都非常感兴趣。当然，她并没有说自己喜爱动物是把他们当宠物，因为那会把托德得罪到家，这种见识她还是有的。她把托德的水壶灌满，又把他睡觉的稻草抖松，然后说了晚安。这时候的托德，差不多又成了从前那只乐观开朗、沾沾自喜的动物。他唱了一两支过去他常在晚宴派对上表演的那种小曲儿，然后蜷曲身子躺在稻草上，美美地睡了一夜，还做了些最开心的梦。

郁闷的日子在继续，在那以后，他们一起聊天很多次，聊得很投机。渐渐地，狱卒的女儿为托德感到很难过了。她觉得，因为一次在她看来不值得一提的冒犯，就将一只可怜的小动物关进监牢，真是可耻之极。自然啰，在自负的托德心目中，她那么关心他，是出于渐渐对他萌生的柔情，但他们之间社会地位悬殊，他不禁有些惋惜，因为她是个长得挺好看的小姑娘，而且明显很仰慕他。

一天早晨，姑娘心不在焉，答非所问。在托德看来，姑娘对他那些机智的言辞和闪烁着火花的评论没有给予适当的注意。

“托德，”她就说，“请听我说。我有个姑妈，是个洗衣妇。”

“得啦，得啦，”托德很有风度、很殷勤地说，“没关系的，别再想这个了。我有好几个姑妈，本来都该做洗衣妇的。”

“安静一分钟，托德，”姑娘说，“你话太多了，这是你最主要的毛病。我正在动脑筋，你打断我的思路了。刚才我说，我有个姑妈是洗衣妇，她给这城堡里的所有囚犯洗衣服──这种挣钱的活儿我们都留给自家人，这你明白的。她每个礼拜一早晨把要洗的衣服拿走，礼拜五傍晚把洗好的衣服送回来。今天是礼拜四。喏，我想到这样一个主意：你很有钱──至少你自己是经常这样对我说的──而她呢很穷。几个英镑对你来说算不了什么，可对她来说却不是个小事情。嗯，我想呀，如果适当地笼络笼络她──用你们动物的话说，给她一点好处──你们也许能做成一笔交易。她让你穿戴上她的衣服帽子什么的，你就可以冒充官家的洗衣妇，从城堡里面逃出去。你们俩在许多方面挺像──特别是身材。”

“我们俩不像，”癞蛤蟆托德气呼呼地说，“我的身材挺漂亮──就癞蛤蟆而言。”

“我姑妈也是，”姑娘答道，“就洗衣妇而言。随你的便吧。你这只可恶、骄傲、忘恩负义的动物，我干吗要为你难过呢，还想帮你！”

“是是是，好好好。真的非常感谢你，”癞蛤蟆托德连忙说道，“可是听我说！你不会真的要蛤蟆府的托德先生装扮成洗衣妇，满世界乱跑吧！”

“你可以继续在这里做你的癞蛤蟆，不用跑啊，”姑娘很生气地回敬道，“我看呀，你是想乘着四匹马拉的马车离开呢！”

正直的托德一向是乐意认错的。“你是个善良聪明的好女孩，”他说，“我确实是一只骄傲愚蠢的癞蛤蟆。请你费心介绍我认识你可敬的姑妈吧，我确信不疑，那位优秀的女士和我一定能达成双方都满意的协议。”

第二天傍晚，姑娘领着她姑妈来到了托德的牢房。这个礼拜洗好的衣服，她包在毛巾里，用别针别住，也带来了。这次会面，老太太事先有了心理准备。她看到托德故意很显眼地放在桌子上的那些金镑[1]后，事情差不多立刻就成了，没再费什么口舌。托德的现钱所得到的回报是一件印花棉布罩衫、一条围裙、一块披肩和一顶褪了色的黑女帽。老太太提出的唯一条件是，用东西塞住她的嘴，把她捆起来，丢在角落里。她解释说，尽管事情显得可疑，她还是希望凭着这种不是很令人信服的骗术，再加上她本人绘声绘色的故事编排，保住她的饭碗。

托德高兴地接受了这个建议。这能使他离开监狱时有点气派，不至于辱没他铤而走险的亡命徒的名声。他欣欣然帮着狱卒的女儿，尽量把她的姑妈弄成一副惨样，装成一个对局面没有控制能力的受害者。

“现在轮到你了，托德，”姑娘说，“脱掉你的外套和马甲吧，你这样子已经够胖的了。”

她一边笑得身子直颤，一边给他套上印花棉布罩衫，扣上扣子，给披肩弄出符合身份的褶子，把褪色女帽的带子系在他下巴下面。

“你简直就是她在镜子里的模样，”她咯咯地笑道，“只不过我敢肯定，你一辈子从来不曾有过一半这样的体面。好啦，再见吧，托德，祝你好运。顺着你进来时的路直走，如果有人对你胡说些什么，你可以照样回几句玩笑话，很可能有人会那样子的，男人嘛。不过，你要记住，你在世上孤身一人，是个弄不好会丢了名声的寡妇。”

托德揣着一颗打颤的心，尽可能平稳地迈着步子，小心翼翼地开始了一次看起来最轻率、最冒险的行动。但很快他就发现，一切都意想不到的顺畅如意。他心中暗喜。可是这公众亲和力还有造成这亲和力的性别，其实都属于另外一个人。想到这个，他觉得有一点点屈辱。在每一扇闩上的小门、每一道阴森的大门面前，洗衣妇的矮胖身材、棉布罩衫上人人熟悉的印花图样仿佛就是一张通行证。他甚至发现，在他犹豫不决，拿不准向哪边拐才对时，是下一道门的看守帮他摆脱了困境。他们急着要离开门口进去喝茶，唤他快些过去别磨蹭，别让他们在那里等上一整夜。主要的危险倒是在于他们跟他开玩笑，说俏皮话。当然啰，他得迅速地作出适当的反应。可这并不容易，因为托德是个自尊心很强的动物，而那些玩笑大多数（他认为）很低劣很不得体，那些俏皮话一点都没有幽默感。虽说费了好大的劲儿，无论如何，他总算压住了火气。他回敬的言语挺适合对方，跟他的假身份也比较相称，并且尽量没有逾越健康情趣的底线。

他拒绝了最后一间警卫室里的再三邀请，躲开了最后一名张开胳膊、佯装热情地恳求来个告别拥抱的看守，终于穿过了最后一个院子。好像经过了好几个钟头似的，但是终于听到咔嗒一响：最外面那道巨大的门上的小便门在他身后关上了。他充满渴望的前额感觉到了外面世界的新鲜空气，他知道，他自由了！

这大胆的行动轻易就成功了，弄得托德头脑发晕，只管快步向镇子里的灯光走去，丝毫不知道下一步该怎么办。他只明确一件事，那就是必须尽快离开这地方，他不得不扮演的那位女士在附近可是一个大家都认识的公众人物哟。

他正边走边动脑筋，不远处，镇子一侧的一些红绿灯引起了他的注意，火车头喷气的噗噗声和货车车厢转轨的哐啷声也传进了他的耳朵。“啊哈！”他心想，“有点小运气！此时此刻，全世界我最想要的东西就是火车站。而且，我不用穿过镇子就能到那里，不必再靠着机敏的应答来撑住这个丢脸的角色，虽然那样效果好得很，对一个人的自尊心却没有好处。”

于是，他径直走到火车站，查看了一下时刻表，发现半小时后会有一趟车，去的方向肯定和他的家差不离。“运气又不错！”托德说。他一下子来了精神，走到售票处买票。

他报了一个站名，那是他所知道的离他们村子最近的小站，蛤蟆府则是他们村子最主要的标志。然后，他机械地伸手到本该是马甲口袋的地方去掏钱。那件棉布罩衫，到目前为止，一直在高尚地支持着他，却被他忘恩负义忘在脑后的棉布罩衫，这时出来阻挠他了。它挫败了他的企图。他像在噩梦中一样，拼命和那件奇怪的东西搏斗。它仿佛抓着他的手不放，把他浑身肌肉的努力都化成了水，并且一直在嘲笑他。其他旅客在他身后排成一排，不耐烦地等着，这时就向他提出些有用或无用的建议、有道理或没道理的批评。最后──不知怎么──他永远也不曾弄明白是怎么回事──他突破了障碍，到达了目的地，摸到了所有马甲口袋永世常在的地方，却发现──不仅钱没有，装钱的口袋也没有，装口袋的马甲也没有！

让他恐怖的是，他想起来啦，外套和马甲都被他落在了牢房里，连同他的皮夹子、钱、钥匙、手表、火柴、铅笔盒──让生活有价值的一切，让多口袋动物、造物主的骄子区别于一口袋产品或没口袋产品的一切。[2]那些低等动物只会蹦蹦跳跳到处乱跑，他们是没有必要的配备来参加真正的竞争的。[3]

情急苦恼之下，他想出个铤而走险的招数来应对。他重新摆出往日那副优雅的派头──乡绅和名牌大学学监的混合派头──他说：“听着！我发现自己忘带钱包了。请把那张票给我吧，好吗？我明天就把钱送来。我是这一带的知名人士。”

售票员盯着他本人和他那顶褪了色的黑色女帽看了片刻，然后大笑起来。“假如过去你经常玩这套把戏，”他说，“那我倒真该认为你是这一带相当知名的人士了。得啦，请你离开窗口吧，夫人。你妨碍别的旅客了！”

一位老绅士已经在他的背上戳了好一会儿，这时猛地把他推开了。更糟的是，老绅士称呼他“我的好娘儿们”，这比那天晚上发生的任何事情都让托德生气。

碰了钉子，满怀的绝望，他沿着月台盲目地往前走去，泪水从鼻子两边直往下淌。他本来要乘坐的那一列火车就停靠在月台边。他心想，眼看着就要安全了，就要到家了，却因为缺少几个可恨的先令，因为靠工资过日子的办事员吹毛求疵不信任，就转眼成了空，这真叫人受不了。他们很快就会发现他逃跑了，派人来追捕，把他抓住，辱骂他，给他上镣铐，拖他回监狱，让他过面包加白水、稻草当铺盖的日子。他们会加派双倍的警卫，给他加倍的处罚。还有，唉，那姑娘会怎样挖苦他啊！怎么办呢？他的腿跑不快，很不幸，他的体型人家认得出来。挤进车厢座位下面藏着行不行呢？他曾经见到小学生用这个办法，那是因为关怀备至的父母提供的盘缠被他们挪到其他更好的用途上去了。他正琢磨着，却发现自己已经到了火车头跟前。那慈爱的司机，一个魁梧的大汉，一只手提着油罐，另一只手捏着一团废棉纱，正在给它上油、擦拭，深情地抚摸它。

“哈啰，大娘！”火车司机说，“遇到麻烦了？你好像不是很开心。”

“唉，先生！”托德一边说，一边又哭了起来，“我是个不幸的穷洗衣妇，把钱全弄丢了，买不起火车票，可今晚我一定得想办法回家，真不知道该怎么办。哎呀，哎呀！”

“确实挺糟糕的，”火车司机沉思着说，“丢了钱──回不了家──要我说，还有小家伙在等着你回去吧？”

“一大帮小家伙呐，”托德抽泣道，“他们要挨饿了──他们会玩火柴──打翻油灯，那些天真的小家伙！──他们会吵架，全都吵成一团。哎呀，哎呀！”

“嗯，我说个办法你看行不行，”善良的火车司机说，“你说，你是专门帮人家洗衣服的。很好，这就行啦。你看到了，我呢是个火车司机，没法否认，这是个脏得要命的工作。穿脏的衬衣一大堆，总是一大堆，我老婆都洗厌烦了。如果你回家后帮我洗几件衬衣，洗好让人送回来，我就让你搭乘我的火车头。这是违反公司条例的，不过，这地方比较偏远，管得不是特别紧。”

癞蛤蟆托德的苦恼变成了狂喜，他迫不及待地爬上火车头，进了驾驶室。当然，他这一辈子没洗过一件衬衣，就是想洗也不会洗，而且，无论如何他也不打算学。不过，他心想，我平安回到蛤蟆府后，又有了钱和装钱的口袋，就多送些钱给火车司机，够他请人洗好多好多衣服。那不一样吗，说不定还更好呐。

信号员挥动那面受人欢迎的小旗，火车司机鸣响汽笛欢快地作答，火车驶出了车站。车速渐渐加快，癞蛤蟆托德看到了铁轨两侧真实的田野、树木、树篱、母牛和马，[4]它们一一从身旁飞一般地闪过。他心想，现在火车每一分钟都在带着他向蛤蟆府靠近。他想到那些同情他的朋友，想到衣袋里叮当作响的钱，睡在上面舒舒服服的软床，还有各种好吃的东西。他想象着人们听他讲述自己的冒险经历和聪明过人时，纷纷表示赞赏和钦佩。他不由得跳上跳下，大喊大叫，东一句西一句地唱起歌来。火车司机惊讶得不得了，因为以前他隔一段时间也会碰上一个洗衣妇，但从来不曾碰到过一个像这样的洗衣妇。

火车行驶了好多好多英里，托德已经在考虑一旦回到家以后晚饭吃些什么。这时他注意到，火车司机脸上露出迷惑不解的神情，把脑袋探出驾驶室外，正在使劲儿听着什么声音。接着，托德又看见他爬上煤堆，目光越过火车头的车顶，盯着什么东西看。然后，他回到驾驶室，对托德说：“非常奇怪，我们是今晚这个方向的最后一趟列车，可是我敢起誓，我听到有另外一趟车跟在后面！”

托德立刻停下了他那套轻浮愚蠢的滑稽动作。他沉下脸来，蔫了，脊椎末端隐隐作痛。那感觉传到双腿，使他很想坐下来，竭力不去琢磨这里面的各种可能性。

当时，月光非常明亮，火车司机在煤堆上站稳了，能看见后面很远地方的铁轨。

一会儿他就嚷嚷起来了：“现在我看清楚啦！是一个火车头，在我们这条铁轨上，开过来啦，速度快得不得了！好像是在追我们！”

悲惨的托德趴在煤尘里，使劲儿想主意。真沮丧喏，就是想不出来。

“他们很快就会撵上我们了！”火车司机嚷道，“火车头里全是人，那样一群人挤在一起，不能再古怪了！有的像老古董看守，挥着戟，戴头盔的警察挥着警棍，还有些衣衫破烂戴圆顶高帽的人，虽然离这么远，我也不会看错，明显是便衣侦探，挥着左轮手枪和手杖。他们全都挥着家伙，全都在喊同一句话：‘停车！停车！停车！’”

这时托德双膝跪倒在煤上，双爪握着拳头举起来，大声哀求道：“救救我，只求你救救我，亲爱的仁慈的火车司机先生，我向你坦白一切！我不是你所看到的朴实的洗衣妇！没有孩子在等我，天真不天真的都没有！我是一只癞蛤蟆──著名的公众人物托德先生，拥有大量土地的业主。我凭着极大的勇气和了不起的聪明才智，刚从一座可憎的地牢里逃出来。是我的冤家对头把我投进监牢的。如果后面火车头上那些家伙把我抓回去，那么可怜的、不幸的、无辜的托德就会被重新戴上镣铐，过面包加白水、稻草当铺盖的日子，再次陷入悲惨的境地！”

火车司机非常严厉地俯视着他，说道：“还是说实话吧，你犯了什么事关进去的？”

“不是什么大不了的事，”可怜的托德脸涨得通红，说道，“只是趁车主吃午饭的时候借了一辆汽车，当时他们用不着车子。其实，我不是故意要偷车，可是他们──特别是法官们──把无心的过失和一时的冲动看得太严重了。”

火车司机神情严肃，他说：“恐怕你确实是一只坏癞蛤蟆呢，按理我该把你交出去，交给被你冒犯的法庭。但你显然是在危难关头，我不会见死不救的。我受不了汽车，这是其一；我在自己的火车头上时，受不了警察的颐指气使，这是其二。而且一看到动物流泪，我总是感到不舒服，心肠就软下来。所以啊，打起精神来吧，托德！我会尽力而为，也许，我们还是能打败他们的！”

他们操起铲子，发狂似的添煤；炉子怒吼着，火花四溅；火车头上下跳动，左右摇晃。可追捕者们还是慢慢地赶上来了。火车司机叹了口气，用一团废棉纱擦了擦前额，说道：“恐怕这不管用，托德。你看见了，他们跑得很轻松，他们的引擎比我们的好。我们只剩下一个办法了，这是你唯一的机会，所以，下面我说的话你要仔细听好喽。我们前面不远，有一条很长的隧道。在隧道另一头，铁轨从一片密林中穿过。喏，过隧道时我会开足马力全速前进，但后面那些家伙会稍微慢下来一点，自然是因为怕出事故。过隧道之后，我会关掉蒸汽，使出最大的力气按下刹车。一到可以安全跳车的时刻，你就得立马跳下去，趁着他们还在隧道里，看不见你，在林子里藏好。然后我会重新全速前进，他们想追的话就追我好啦，想追多久追多久，想追多远追多远。现在注意了，做好准备，我叫你跳你就跳！”

他们继续添煤，火车射进隧道，火车头怒吼着嘎嘎地响着直往前冲，从隧道另一头射出来，驶进了清新的空气和宁静的月光之中。只见那座林子黑魆魆的，很帮忙地躺在铁轨两侧。司机关掉蒸汽，按下了刹车。癞蛤蟆托德走到阶梯踏板上，当车速减慢到几乎像步行速度一样时，他听见司机大喊一声：“现在，跳！”

托德跳下去，顺势沿着路基向前滚了一小段，拍拍屁股爬起来，没受伤，就飞快地爬进林子，藏了起来。

他向外面窥望，看见他搭乘的火车又加快速度，在远处消失了。然后，追他的火车从隧道里猛冲出来，吼叫着，鸣着汽笛。车上那一帮杂七杂八的人挥舞着各式武器，喊叫着：“停车！停车！停车！”他们过去后，癞蛤蟆托德从心底里笑了出来──自从他被投进监狱以后，他第一回笑得这样舒心。

但很快他就笑不出来了。他意识到，夜已很深，又黑又冷，这是一片陌生的林子，他没钱，也没地方找晚饭吃，朋友和家都还离得很远。火车的吼叫声和嘎嘎声过去之后，一切都归于死一般的寂静，让人不寒而栗。他不敢离开树林的掩蔽，只想着尽量远离铁路，所以一个劲儿地往林子里面钻。

在高墙里面待了好多个礼拜之后，他觉得树林很陌生、很不友好，好像有意要耍弄他似的。欧夜鹰发着呆板的嘎嘎声，使他觉得林子里到处是搜索他的看守，正向他包围过来。一只猫头鹰悄无声息地向他俯冲下来，翅膀擦到了他的肩头，吓得他跳起来，心里面怕怕地满以为那是一只手。然后，那猫头鹰像蛾子一样轻快地飞掠而去，“嗬！嗬！嗬！”地发着粗俗的笑声，让托德觉得趣味非常低级。有一回他遇到一只狐狸，那家伙停下来，摆出一副挖苦人的架势，上下打量着他，说道：“哈啰，洗衣妇！这礼拜少了一只袜子和一个枕套！注意，别再出这种事！”说完就窃笑着，大摇大摆地走开了。托德四处看，想找块石头扔他，可就是一块也找不到，把他恼得不能再恼。他又冷又饿，筋疲力尽，最后找了棵中空的树作为栖身处，用树枝和枯叶，尽可能为自己铺了一张比较舒服的床，呼呼一觉，睡到天亮。

[2]基督教认为天地万物都是上帝──造物主创造的，所以作者用了“产品”这个词。作者在这里寓以丰富的戏谑成分。其一，对癞蛤蟆托德自视高人一等的戏谑；其二，对人类自视高于其他动物的戏谑：以口袋之有无或多少作为标准来区分高等动物和低等动物，借以戏谑人类区分动物等级之高低的标准，并调侃人类社会的等级标准。另外，“一口袋产品”指的是袋鼠？──也许。

第九章　旅行者种种


水鼠兰特烦躁不安，也不知道因为什么。从表面上看，夏季仍然处在全盛期的顶峰。尽管耕地上碧绿已经让位给金黄，尽管花楸浆果正在变红，树林已经零零星星夹杂着烈焰般的黄褐色，但是，光、热和色彩所呈现的度依然不减，并没有季节将更迭、天气要转寒的征兆。不过呢，果园里、树篱间，不停歇的合唱已经冷静下来，成了几个依然不知疲倦的演唱者时有时无的晚祷歌声。知更鸟又开始亮相，空气中有了一种变迁和分离的氛围。当然，布谷鸟已经沉默很久，而许多别的长羽毛的朋友，几个月来一直是这幅熟悉的乡村风景画的一部分，一直是它的小小社交圈子的成员，也渐渐地不露面了。看来，各个队列好像都在每天不断地变稀疏。兰特一直关注着飞禽队列的动向，这时看出它们一天天有了南迁的趋势。甚至黑夜里躺在床上时，他也觉得自己辨认得出，那些急不可耐的翅尖的拍击声和震颤声正从头顶上的夜空掠过，响应那不容违逆的召唤。

大自然的大饭店跟别的大饭店一样，有旺季也有淡季。随着客人们一个个收拾行李、付账、离去，客饭餐厅里每开一次饭，席位就可怜兮兮地缩掉一圈。随着套房一间间被关掉，地毯一块块被卷起，侍者一个个被辞退，那些留下来不走，等待明年重新全面开业的搭伙人和寄宿者，看着大家走的走、散的散，听着别人热切地讨论计划、路线和新居，只见到伙伴们一天天减少，情绪不免受到感染。这时人就会惴惴不安、抑郁消沉、爱发牢骚。干吗要这样急着换地方呢？干吗不安安静静待在这里，像我们一样，快快活活地过日子？你不了解这大饭店淡季里的情形，不知道我们这些留下来的，把一年四季的风光看个遍，自有多少乐趣。毫无疑问，对方总是这样来回答：你说的全是事实，我们很羡慕你，也许改年我们会留下来，但这一回我们约好了，巴士已经到门口，我们到时间了！于是，他们笑一笑，点点头，就出发了。留下来的人对他们是既想念，又怨恨。水鼠兰特属于那种自给自足的动物，扎根在这块土地上，无论谁走，他反正不走。可他还是不由得注意到了气氛的变化，从骨头里感受到了那气氛的影响。

这种迁徙在持续，很难安下心来认认真真做点事。水位低了，水流缓了，水边的灯芯草已经长得又高又密。兰特离开河岸，漫无目的地向乡间走去。他穿过一两片已经被太阳烤干、弥漫着尘土的牧场，一头钻进了麦田。这是一片波浪起伏、沙沙作响的黄色海洋，处处轻柔地运动着、细声地低语着。他经常在这里游逛，在粗壮挺拔的麦秆丛林里穿行。它们在他头顶上支撑起自己的一片金色天空，一片永远在舞蹈、光彩熠熠、细雨绵绵的天空。有时被过路的风刮歪了，但一个打挺、一阵欢快的笑声过后，这天空又恢复了原样。在这里，他还有许多小朋友，那是一个自成一统的社会，过着充实忙碌的生活，但总是有片刻闲暇同来访的客人说几句闲话，交换一点消息。不过今天，尽管田鼠和巢鼠客气得很，却好像一门心思扎在自己的事情上。许多鼠儿在忙着打洞挖地道，另外一些鼠儿一小群一小群地聚在一起，核查小套房的计划书和图纸。要规划得合意、紧凑，还要选便利的位置，靠近大商店。有些鼠儿正在把积满灰尘的衣箱衣篓拖出来，还有些鼠儿已经在埋头打包自己的财物。遍地都是一堆堆一捆捆的小麦、燕麦、大麦、山毛榉坚果和其他各种干果，乱七八糟地放着，等待运走。

“这不是老水鼠仔嘛！”他们一见到他就喊道，“过来搭把手，兰特，别在那里闲站着！”

“你们在搞什么鬼呀？”水鼠兰特凶巴巴地说，“你们也知道的吧，眼下还没到考虑过冬住处的时候，早着呐！”

“是啊，我们知道，”一只田鼠有几分羞怯地解释道，“可提前准备总是好的，是不？我们真的必须得赶在那些可怕的机器来田里到处咔哒咔哒之前，把所有家具、行李和存粮从这里搬走。而且你知道的呀，如今这世道，最好的套房很快就会被挑完的。如果去晚了，就只好随便找个地方住下了。而且新套房还得先好好装修一下，搬进去住才合适。当然啦，现在是早了点，这我们知道，不过，也只是先开始干起来而已。”

“干什么干啊，麻烦，”水鼠兰特说，“今天天气好极了。还不如出去玩玩船啊，到树篱边逛逛啊，或者到树林里搞个野餐什么的。”

“嗯，我看，今天就不去了吧，谢谢你，”田鼠急忙答道，“也许改天能行──等我们稍微有空的时候……”

水鼠兰特轻蔑地从鼻子里哼了一声，转过身去要走，却被一个帽盒绊了一下，摔倒了，嘴里跑出几个有失尊严的词来。

“一个人如果小心些，”一只田鼠有几分尖刻地说道，“走路时看着点，就不会伤着自己──不会失态了。小心那只手提箱，兰特！你最好找个地方坐下来。过一两个小时，我们也许会稍微有空来陪你了。”

“我料想得到，你所谓的‘有空’，圣诞节前是不太会有的。”水鼠兰怒气冲冲地回敬道，择路走出了麦田。

他有些沮丧地回到河边──他忠实安稳的老河，决不会打包迁徙，去过冬的住所。

他窥见一只燕子栖息在流苏一样垂挂在河岸边的柳枝中间。不一会儿就又来了一只，随后第三只也加入进来。燕子们在大树枝上坐立不安，动个不停，认真地低声交谈着。

“怎么，已经要走了？”水鼠兰特溜达到他们跟前，说道，“着什么急呀？要我说，简直就是荒唐可笑。”

“哦，如果你指的是要离开，还没呢，”第一只燕子答道，“我们只是计划计划，把事情安排安排。你知道的呀，好好商量商量今年走哪条路线，在哪里歇脚，等等。说说也开心的嘛！”

“开心？”水鼠兰特说，“我就是不明白这有什么好开心的。如果你们不得不离开这可爱的地方，离开会想念你们的朋友，离开你们刚住进去不久的温暖的家，唉，一旦时候到了，我一点也不怀疑，你们会勇敢地离开，去面对一切的麻烦和困苦，适应新的环境和生活的改变，而且还会假装自己并不是很不快乐。可是，在真正需要离开之前，就很想谈论，哪怕想一想，这就……”

“不，你自然不理解喽，”第二只燕子说，“首先，我们心里面为这事感到激动，那可是一种甜蜜的不安哟。然后，记忆仿佛归巢的鸽子，一个个接踵而来。晚上它们拍着翅膀穿过我们的梦境，白天它们伴随我们在天上盘旋。当遗忘已久的那些地方的气味、声音和名字，一个个渐渐回来向我们示意时，我们就非常渴望互相询问，对比各种信息，好让自己确信那一切都是真真实实的。”

“今年能不能不走，就停一年也不行吗？”水鼠兰特眼巴巴地提议道，“我们大家会尽力让你们感到舒适自在。你们不知道，当你们在远方的时候，我们在这里日子过得有多美。”

“有一年我试着‘停’过，”第三只燕子说，“那时我太喜欢这地方了，该走的时候就犹豫了，没跟别的燕子一块儿走。开始几个礼拜还挺不错，可是到后来，哦哟哟，夜太长、太烦人了！白天不见阳光，直打哆嗦！空气又冷又湿，一亩地都找不到一只虫子！不，这可没什么好的。我的勇气全泄光了。一个暴风雪的寒夜里，我拍拍翅膀起飞了，借着强劲的东风，顺利地飞向内地。过大山口时，雪下得很大，我顽强地拼了一场才飞过去。当我向着下方，向着那么蓝、那么宁静的湖泊快速下滑时，热烘烘的阳光又晒在了背上。那种幸福至极的感觉，还有吃到第一口肥肥的虫子的滋味，我永远都忘不了！过去就像一场噩梦，未来全都是快乐的假日。一个礼拜接一个礼拜，我不断向南飞，轻轻松松、慢慢悠悠地飞，敢停留多久就停留多久，但始终听从着召唤！不，我受过告诫了，再也不敢动违抗的心思了。”

“是啊，南方的召唤，南方的召唤！”另外两只燕子像在梦中一样地呢喃着，“南方的色彩，南方的歌，南方的天空灿烂明媚！哦，你还记得吗……”他们不知不觉沉湎到温情的回忆里，把水鼠兰特忘到了脑后。他在一旁听得入了迷，一颗心跟着燃烧起来。他知道，自己那根一直蛰伏着、潜藏着的心弦，也终于开始震颤了。这几只准备南徙的小鸟的交谈，他们的苍白的间接描述，就已经有足够的力量唤醒这狂野的新感觉，让他浑身激灵灵、颤栗不已。一旦身临其境──让真实的南方阳光温情地触一触，让真真的南方香风拂一拂，那又该怎样的心潮澎湃呢？他闭上眼睛，鼓起勇气放任自己做了一会儿梦。等他睁开眼睛再看时，大河竟仿佛成了钢灰色，透着寒意，绿色的田野也仿佛灰蒙蒙没有了光泽。这时他那颗忠诚的心，仿佛在大叫大喊，责备他那个软弱自我的背叛变节。

“那你们干吗还每一次都回来呢？”他嫉妒地问燕子们，“我们这乡下小地方，又穷又土又乏味，有什么吸引你们的地方？”

第一只燕子说：“你认为，到了当令的季节，我们不会感觉到另一种召唤吗？葱翠的草甸子、湿润的果园、有许多虫子的温暖的池塘、吃草的牛、翻晒的干草、簇拥在屋檐完美之屋[1]周围的所有农家房屋，不会召唤我们吗？”

第二只燕子说：“你以为，生灵中只有你才如饥似渴，盼望再一次听到布谷鸟的歌声吗？”

第三只燕子说：“到了当令的时候，我们又会得思乡病，想念在英国河流的水面上摇曳的幽静睡莲。可是今天，那一切好像都显得苍白、稀薄、遥远。此时此刻，我们的血液在跟着另一种音乐跳舞呢。”

他们又只顾着自己呢呢喃喃地聊了，这一回他们喋喋不休的醉人话题是紫罗兰色的大海、黄褐色的沙滩和有很多蜥蜴的堤坝。

水鼠兰特又烦躁不安起来，漫无目的地走开了。他爬到大河北岸平缓的斜坡上，躺下来，向南边望去。丘陵地在四周远远地围成一个巨大的圆环，把更远的地方挡在了他的视野之外──今日之前，它一直就是他的地平线，他的月球山脉[2]，他的世界尽头，再过去，就没有什么他想看、想知道的了。可是今天，他凝望着南方，心中澎湃起了一种新的需求。他觉得那绵亘着的低矮轮廓的上方，澄澈的天空中仿佛颤动着应许之光。可是今天，没见过的世界成了他的一切，未知的天地成了他生活中的唯一真实。今天，小土丘的这一边成了真正的空白，而另一边却是一幅熙熙攘攘、色彩缤纷的全景图──他内心的眼睛看得清清楚楚：多美啊，碧色的大海，跳跃的浪花，涌起的波峰！多美啊，沐浴着阳光的海岸，白色的海边别墅在橄榄林的映衬下熠熠闪光！多美啊，寂静的港湾里挤满了华丽的船舶，正准备驶向盛产美酒和香料的紫色岛屿，低低地横陈在懒洋洋的海面上的岛屿！

他站起身，重新往下朝水边走去。然后他又改变主意，转向尘土飞扬的林荫小路的路边。小路一侧是低于路面的树篱，乱蓬蓬的，茂密而阴凉。他躺下来，半截身子埋在里边。这样他可以眼睛看着碎石铺面的小路，心里想着它通往的奇妙世界，脑子里想象着可能路过的种种旅行者，还有他们去追寻或不寻自来的好运和奇遇──在外面，在那一边，在远方！

耳朵里传来了脚步声，一个有些疲惫的行路人的身影进入了视野。他看出来，那是一只老鼠，一只风尘仆仆的老鼠。那旅行者走到近前时，很有礼貌地用带着外国味的姿势向他致意，犹豫了片刻，然后带着愉快的笑容，从小路上下来，走进阴凉的草丛中，在他身旁坐下。他好像很累，水鼠兰特听任他休息，没问他什么。兰特明白他脑子里想着些什么，也明白这样一条生活准则：动物们有时只是无言地做伴，放松一下肌肉，让脑子偷个懒。

旅行者很瘦，尖脸，肩背有些驼。他的爪子又细又长，眼角有许多皱纹，戴着一对小小的金耳环，耳朵长得齐整纤巧。他身上的蓝色针织套头毛衣褪了色，蓝底色的裤子上沾了不少泥，屁股上打了补丁。他随身携带的一点点财物，包裹在一块蓝棉布手绢里。

陌生人歇了一会儿之后，叹息一声，嗅了嗅空气，看了看四周。

“风送来的温暖气息，是苜蓿的气味，”他评论道，“我们听到的声音，是母牛在后面吃草，吃几口草，轻轻地喷一口气。远处有收割庄稼的声音，背靠林地的村舍那边升起一缕蓝色的炊烟。大河就在附近流淌，因为我听见了黑水鸡的叫声，而且从你的体型，我看出来，你是个淡水水手。似乎一切都睡着了，但又一直在运行着。你过的是一种上等的日子，朋友。只要足够强壮，肯定能过上天底下最好的日子！”

“是啊，这就是生活，唯一活得值的生活。”水鼠兰特做梦似的回应道，不像平时那么信心十足。

“我说的不完全是那个意思，”陌生人谨慎地说，“但肯定是最好的。我曾经那样生活过，所以我了解。正因为我刚那样生活过──六个月──所以知道是最好的。我走到这里，腿酸了，肚子饿了。我正在远离它，听从古老的召唤，徒步向南走，回到过去的生活中去。属于我的那种生活，我离不开的那种生活。”

“难道，这位又是他们中的一个？”水鼠兰特沉思着。“你刚从哪里来？”他问。他几乎不敢问他准备到哪里去，因为答案他似乎心知肚明。

“一个挺好的小农场，”旅行者简短地答道，“那个方向，”他冲着北边歪歪脑袋，“在什么位置并不重要。在那里我什么都不缺，生活中我有权期望的一切都有，还不止呢。可我到了这里！不过，来这里我同样也很高兴，很高兴来这里！又走完了许多英里的路，离我心中的愿望又近了许多！”

他紧盯着地平线，眼睛里闪着光。他仿佛在倾听某种声音，英国内陆地区虽然充满了欢快的牧场歌声和农家歌声，却缺少那种声音。

“你不是我们中间的一分子，”水鼠兰特说，“连农场主都不是。我敢断定，你甚至不属于这个国家。”

“对，”陌生人答道，“我是一只航海鼠，是啊，我最初起航的港口是君士坦丁堡，不过，在那里，我同样可以说是一个外国人。你一定听说过君士坦丁堡吧，朋友？一个美丽的城市，也是一个古老而光荣的城市。你也许还听说过挪威国王西格德吧，他曾率领六十艘船航海到君士坦丁堡。当他的随从从大街上骑马经过时，沿街都撑着紫色和金色的天篷表示敬意。皇帝和皇后驾临他的船，同他一起饮宴。西格德回国时，他手下的北欧人有许多留下来，加入了皇帝的御林军。我的祖先，一只在挪威出生的老鼠，也随着西格德赠送给皇帝的船留了下来。从那以后，我们家族的人一直做航海家，这就不足为怪了。对我来说，我出生的城市是我的家，但它和伦敦河之间的每一个令人愉快的港口也同样是我的家。我全都熟悉，它们也熟悉我。随便在哪个码头或海滩上把我放下，我都等于回到了家。”

“我猜你常去远洋航行吧，”水鼠兴趣越来越浓，说道，“成年累月看不到陆地，给养短缺，淡水限量供应，心总是同浩瀚的海洋相通，诸如此类？”

“根本不是，”海鼠坦白地说，“你描述的那种生活根本不适合我。我干的是海岸营生，难得看不到陆地。吸引我的是海岸上的快乐时光，那可不下于航海哟。哦，那些南方海港！海港的气息、夜晚的锚泊灯，真令人悠然神往！”

“嗯，也许你选择这种方式更好，”水鼠嘴上这样说，心里面却有些怀疑，“你要是愿意，就给我讲讲海岸上的事吧。说一说，一个有志气的动物可以指望从那里带回什么样的收获，将来有一天在炉火旁，可以用不平凡的回忆来温暖最后的时光。至于我的生活，坦白地说，我如今感到有些狭獈、有些闭塞呢。”

“我最近一次出航以后，”海鼠开讲道，“最终在这个国家上了岸。我怀着很高的期望，想在内陆办个农场。这次航行将成为历次航行中的一个好例证，实际上，将成为我色彩缤纷的人生的缩影。像往常一样，此行也是家庭纠纷促成的。家里刮起了龙卷风，我就搭上一艘小商船，从君士坦丁堡起航，驶向希腊群岛和黎凡特[3]。在我们经过的著名海域，每一个浪头都跳荡着不死的记忆。[4]那是些金色的白昼、芳香的夜晚！船一直在进港、出港，到处都是老朋友。白天天气热，我们就睡在凉爽的神殿或者废弃的蓄水池里。日落后，我们饮宴、唱歌，头顶上那天鹅绒般的夜空镶着非凡的群星！从那里我们折向亚德里亚海，沿海岸航行。亚德里亚海海滨浸泡在琥珀色、玫瑰色和水蓝宝石色的大气中，我们把船停泊在陆地环抱的宽阔港湾里，在古老而高贵的城市中漫游。最后，在一个早晨，当太阳庄严地在我们身后升起时，我们沿着一条金色的航道驶进了威尼斯。啊，威尼斯真是一座美丽的城市，在那里，老鼠可以自在地闲逛，轻松地享乐！逛累了，晚上可以坐在大运河边沿，跟朋友们一起饮宴。空中乐声洋溢，头上繁星满天，锃亮的钢质船头光芒闪烁。那些小艇摇曳着，一只只紧挨在一起，你可以从上面走过去，从运河这一边直走到那一边！要说吃的，你喜欢鲜贝吗？嗳，嗳，还是暂时不要在这个话题上多耽搁吧。”

他沉默了一会儿。水鼠也一言不发，他入了迷，在梦中的运河上漂着，幻觉中听见一支歌像钟声一样，高亢地回荡在水汽蒙蒙、灰蒙蒙、浪涛叠卷的运河大堤之间。

“最后我们重新向南航行，”海鼠接着说道，“沿着意大利海岸一路南下，到巴勒摩才泊岸。我在那里下船，去海滨度过了一段很长的快乐时光。我从不跟随一条船太久，那样会思想狭隘，产生偏见。再说，西西里岛是我常去的快乐好地方之一。我认识那里的每一个人，他们的习俗也正适合我。我在岛上快快活活过了好多个礼拜，同内地的乡村朋友们待在一起。又待得不耐烦了，我就沾光搭上一条驶往撒丁岛和科西嘉岛的商船，很高兴再一次感觉到清新的海风迎面扑来，大海的浪花飞沫溅到脸上。”

“可是下面的……货舱，我想你们是这样叫它来着，那里面是不是又热又闷？”水鼠问。

航海家正眼看着他，眨了一下眼睛表示怀疑。“我是个老手，”他很率直地说，“船长的舱房对我来说够好的啦。”

“根据各种流传的说法，海上生活很苦。”水鼠喃喃地说，陷入了沉思。

“对于水手来说是很苦。”航海家严肃地说，又隐约眨了一下眼睛。

“在科西嘉，”他接着说道，“我搭上了一条运酒去欧洲大陆的船。傍晚，我们赶到阿拉西奥，把船泊好，将酒桶拖上甲板，用一根长绳子串起来，从船舷边扔下大海。然后水手们登上小艇，向岸边划去，一路唱着歌，后面拖着一长串颠簸着的酒桶，像一英里长的一队海豚。沙滩上有马匹在等着。马拉着酒桶，在小镇里，沿着陡峭的街道往上冲，叮叮咚咚好不热闹。最后一桶酒送到后，我们就走人，去给肚子里补充点东西，歇一歇。晚上，和朋友们一起坐坐，喝酒到深夜。第二天早晨，我跑到那个好大好大的橄榄林子里，换换空气，休息休息。我暂时同海岛打够了交道，在港口和船上待了够多时间，所以，我去农夫中间过了一段懒散的日子。我躺在那里看他们干活儿，或者伸开四肢躺在高高的山坡上，遥远的下方是蔚蓝的地中海。就这样，一程一程，有时步行，有时乘船，终于到了马赛，遇到些过去的同船水手，拜访了一些准备出洋的大船，又一次参加聚会饮宴。说到鲜贝了！嗨，我有时梦到鲜贝或马赛，会从梦中哭醒！”

“这话题提醒了我，”懂礼貌的水鼠说道，“你偶尔提起你饿了，我该早点说这话才是：你一定愿意歇个脚，同我一起吃顿中饭吧？我的洞就在附近。时间已经过了中午，非常欢迎你去随便吃点东西。”

“那我就打扰啦，你是个好心人，真够朋友，”海鼠说，“其实，我坐下时已经饿了，无意间提到鲜贝以后，胃里就一直一阵阵难受得厉害。不过，你可以把吃食拿到这里来吗？除非迫不得已，我是不太喜欢受拘束的。在这里无拘无束，我可以一边吃，一边再给你讲讲航海见闻，说说我的愉快生活──至少对我来说很愉快。而且从你专心致志的神态，我断定它给你的印象也是不错的。但如果我们进了屋，百分之九十九我一会儿就睡着。”

“这确实是个极好的建议。”水鼠说。他急匆匆地起身往回赶。到家后他取出午餐篮，往里面装了一份简单的饭菜。他记着陌生人的出身和喜好，特意往里面放了一条一码长的法式面包，一根大蒜在里面唱歌的香肠，一块躺倒了哭叫着的干胳，一个裹着稻草的长颈瓶──里面装着曾在遥远的南方山坡上闪耀并将之收集、贮藏起来的瓶装阳光。[5]他拿起东西，全速赶回海鼠身边。他们俩一起打开篮子，把里面的东西拿出来，摆放在路边草地上。水手对他的口味和判断力大加赞赏，让他高兴得满脸通红。

海鼠的饥饿感刚减缓了些，就马上接着讲他最近一次的航海经历。他引导着他的单纯的听众，在西班牙从一个港口到另一个港口，让他在里斯本、波尔图和波尔多上岸，把他引荐给康沃尔郡和德文郡那些令人愉快的海港，一路驶过来，沿英吉利海峡北上，来到最后一个码头前沿的海上，在那里碰上了长时间的逆风，被暴风雨驱赶，经受日晒雨淋，然后才上了岸。在那里，他领会到又一个春天的神奇暗示和预兆，燃起激情，长途跋涉，奔向内陆，渴望远离令人厌倦的海上颠簸，体验一段平静的农场生活。

水鼠着了魔，激动得浑身颤抖，一里格一里格[6]地跟随着冒险家，穿过暴风雨中的港湾和拥挤的停泊处，乘着奔涌的潮水越过港口的沙洲，驶进蜿蜒的、急湾处隐藏着繁华小镇的河流……最后，在沉闷的内陆农场长住下来。这时，水鼠遗憾地叹口气，从叙述中走了出来：农场里的事他一点都不想听。

这时，他们已经吃完饭，航海家恢复了精神，劲头更足了。他说话的声音响亮起来，眼睛里放着仿佛是从遥远的海中灯塔摄来的亮光。他给自己的玻璃杯里倒满了鲜红透亮的南方葡萄酒，向水鼠倾着身子，嘴里说着话，眼睛迫使水鼠同他对视着，控制住了水鼠的身心。他那双眼睛是灰绿色的，如同动荡的北方海洋，水面上泛着一串串变幻不定的白沫。玻璃杯里的酒灼灼地闪耀着红宝石的光，正仿佛南方的心脏，为了有勇气与它的脉搏合拍的人而跳动着。这两种光，变幻的灰光和安定的红光，主宰了水鼠，使他陷于动弹不得、痴痴迷迷、瘫软无力的状态。那些光芒以外的平静世界渐渐地远去，不复存在了。只听得见话语，奇妙的话语，在不断地向外涌流。不知道那纯粹是说话呢，还是有时渐渐地变成了唱歌──水手们起锚时唱的船歌，帆索在凄厉的东北风中响亮的嗡鸣，日落时分船夫背对杏黄色天空拉网时唱的小调，吉他和曼陀林在意大利凤尾船或者土耳其长划艇上的合奏？不知道那些话语是否变成了风的哭泣──起先只是哀怨的呜咽，渐渐地增强为含怒的尖叫，继而拉高成凄厉的呼啸，最后沉落下来，化作鼓起的风帆所滤出的空气的淅沥？所有这些声音，那着了魔的聆听者仿佛全都听到了──连同海鸥饥饿的悲诉、浪涛拍岸的轻柔轰响、海滩砂石抗议的呼声。它们又渐渐地变回到话语。聆听者揣着一颗怦怦直跳的心，相随着去十几个海港冒险──打仗、逃跑、重整旗鼓、相助同伴、仗义行侠；又去海岛寻宝，在平静的泻湖钓鱼，在温暖的白色沙滩上打瞌睡一整天。他听他讲深海捕鱼，用一英里长的网捞上来银光闪闪的一大网收获。他听他讲险情突至：无月的夜晚忽然间扑来喧腾的浪涛，大雾中头顶上蓦地冒出巨大邮轮的高耸的船艏。他听他讲返回故乡的快乐：船绕过海岬，驶进灯火通明的港口；码头上人影绰绰、欢呼声四起，锚链下浪花飞溅；归来者沿着陡峭的小街攀爬前行，走向透过红窗帘映射出来的温馨灯光。

最后，他在白日梦里依稀觉得冒险家站了起来，但仍然在说话，仍然在用那双海灰色的眼睛牢牢地控制着他。

“现在，”他轻轻地说着，“我要重新上路了，坚持不懈地向西南方走，风尘仆仆地走很多天，直走到那座灰色的海滨小镇为止。它紧贴在陡峭的港湾一侧，我对它太熟悉了。在那里，你从昏暗的门口向下俯望一段一段的石头台阶，看到巨大的粉红色缬草花簇悬垂着，石阶尽头是一汪波光粼粼的蓝色海水。古老海堤的铁环和木桩上拴着一只只小船，它们漆成鲜亮的颜色，跟我童年时爬进爬出的那些船一样。大潮时，鲑鱼在潮头跳跃，一群群的鲭鱼闪着光，从码头边海滩前嬉游而过。日日夜夜都有巨轮从窗前滑过，进港泊岸或者驶向辽阔的大海。所有航海国家的船早晚都会到达那里；在注定的时刻，我选中的船会在那里松开锚链。我会从从容容，逗留等待，直到最后那条为我而来的船，满载着货物，船艏斜桁俯指着港口，被绞船索拽入航道中央。那时我就乘着小船或顺着锚链，悄悄溜上船去。然后，在一天早晨，水手们的歌声和脚步声、起锚机的尖叫声、锚链收上来时欢快的嘎嘎声会把我叫醒。我们扯开船艏的三角小帆和前桅的大帆，船缓缓地转舵，海港一侧的白色房屋慢慢地从我们身边向后滑去，远航就开始了！她稳稳地驶向海岬时身上还披着帆布；一到外海，她就斜对着风，任凭碧色的海浪哗哗地拍打着，直指南方！”[7]

“你呢，你也会来的，小兄弟。因为时光流逝，一去不返，而南方依然在等待着你。听从召唤，在不可逆转的时间逝去之前，踏上冒险的旅途吧！只要门在你身后砰的一声关上，你向前跨出轻快的一步，就走出了旧生活，迈进了新的人生！将来有一天，很久后的一天，杯中酒干了，戏演完了，如果愿意，你可以慢慢地走回家，回到这里，在你的安静的河边坐下，拿出满满一大袋的上等回忆招待伙伴们。一路上你很容易赶上我，因为你年轻，我却上了年纪，腿脚软了。我会走走停停，回头看看，最后肯定能看见你赶上来，步子匆忙，心情轻松愉快，满脸的神情写的是‘南方’两个字！”

他的声音渐渐消失，就像一只昆虫的小喇叭声音很快变小，归于沉寂。水鼠兰特瘫在那里，瞪着眼睛，看见白色的路面上最后只剩下远方一个小黑点。

他机械地站起来，开始收拾午餐篮，仔仔细细，不慌不忙。他机械地回到家里，把几样小件必需品和特别珍爱的宝物归拢来，装进一只小背包里。他慢条斯理地干着，像梦游者一样在屋子里转悠着，始终半张着嘴倾听着。他把小背包甩到肩上，仔细挑了一根行路用的结实棍子，不慌不忙，但也毫不犹豫，一步跨过门槛，正遇上鼹鼠莫尔出现在门前。

“嗨，你要去哪里，鼠仔？”鼹鼠莫尔惊讶至极地问，一把抓住他的胳膊。

“去南方，同别的旅行者一起，”水鼠兰特喃喃地说，声音像说梦话一样的单调，眼睛根本不看着人，“先去海边，再乘船，到那些召唤着我的海岸去！”

他很坚决地往门外挤，仍然不慌不忙，却已经是横下了心。鼹鼠莫尔惊恐至极，用身体堵住他，察看着他的双眼，发现它们呆滞无神，变成了布满条纹、游移不定的灰色眼睛──不是他朋友的，而是别的动物的眼睛！他紧紧地抓着他，把他拽进去，推倒，摁住。

水鼠兰特拼命挣扎了一会儿，然后仿佛一下子就没了劲儿。他精疲力竭、一动不动地躺在地上，闭着眼睛，打着哆嗦。鼹鼠莫尔就扶他站起来，把他安置在椅子里。他瘫坐在里面，缩成一团，浑身剧烈地哆嗦着；一点一点，最后爆发出一阵歇斯底里的干嚎。莫尔把门关紧，将小背包扔进抽屉里锁好，然后静静地在朋友旁边的桌子上坐下，等待这阵奇怪的疯魔病过去。渐渐地，水鼠兰特昏昏沉沉地打起了盹儿。在不安的浅睡中，他惊醒了好几次，嘴巴里含含糊糊地咕哝着。在懵懂的莫尔听来，他说的都是些奇奇怪怪、疯疯傻傻的外国事情。然后，他进入了深深的睡眠。

鼹鼠莫尔心里很着急，走开去忙了一会儿家务事，回到客厅时天已经快黑了。他发现水鼠兰特仍然在原来的地方，实际上已经完全醒了，却无精打采、一言不发、垂头丧气。他匆匆瞄了一眼兰特的眼睛，发现它们又变成了原来的深棕色，清澈明亮。他感到无比满意，在兰特身边坐下来，试着帮助他打起精神，把前面发生的事情想起来、说出来。

可怜的鼠仔尽其所能，一点一点地解释着。可那些事情大多是联想，用冷静的语言怎能表达清楚呢？那曾经对他歌唱、至今萦绕在心头的大海之声，他怎样复述给另一个人听？航海家回忆的上百件往事的魔力，他怎样间接地重现？即使对他本人来说，现在也是魔咒已破，魅力已消失。他发现，几小时前似乎是不可避免要发生、且是唯一可能发生的事，现在想说清楚都已经很难。所以呀，他没能向鼹鼠莫尔说明白那一天的经历就没什么可奇怪的了。

对莫尔来说，至少这一点是明白的：那一场疯魔病大发作虽然使兰特受了惊吓，给他留下了沮丧的副作用，却已经过去了，兰特的神志也已经恢复正常。不过，一时间，他对日常生活中的所有事情全都没有了兴趣。而变化中的季节无疑正带来一天一个样的事务和活动，对此他也没有兴趣开开心心地预作安排了。

后来，在一个偶然的机会，鼹鼠莫尔装作漫不经心地转移了话题，说起正在收割的庄稼、堆得像小山的四轮马车、拉车的马、不断升高的干草垛、收割完毕的田地上空升起的好大一轮月亮，还有月光下星罗棋布的一捆捆庄稼。然后他说起周围苹果在变红，核桃栗子在变成褐色。再后来又说起做果酱，做蜜饯，做果子酒……就这样一步一步，从从容容地，最后说到了仲冬，说起仲冬时节的欢乐开怀和温暖舒适的室内生活。这时，他简直成了抒情诗人。

慢慢地，水鼠兰特开始坐起来，同莫尔一起谈论这些事。他呆滞的眼睛变亮了，脸上少了几分留神倾听着什么的神情。

乖巧的莫尔就悄悄地溜开，回来时拿了一支铅笔和几张半页的纸，放在桌子上朋友的胳膊肘旁边。

“你有好久没有做诗了，”他说，“今晚你就写一点试试，别再──嗯，老想那么多。我觉着呀，你写上几句，哪怕只是几个押韵的词，感觉就会好很多。”

水鼠兰特厌烦地把纸从身边推开，可细心的莫尔趁机离开了客厅。过了一会儿，他从门外向里面偷看，窥见水鼠兰特已经两耳不闻窗外事，一心只在做歪诗了。只见他一会儿草草地写几个字，一会儿吮着铅笔屁股。虽然他吮的时间比写的时间长很多，但是鼹鼠莫尔很高兴地了解到，他的病终于开始见好了。

第十章　托德的进一步冒险


那棵中空的树正门朝东，所以时间很早托德就被唤醒了。一是因为阳光泻了进来，照在他身上；二是因为脚指头冻得太厉害，害得他做了个怪梦。他梦见自己在家中，在一个寒冷的冬夜，在那间有都铎式窗户的漂亮卧室里，躺在床上。他的被子、床单、枕头、毯子全都从床上起来了，发牢骚，提抗议，说它们再也受不了这寒冷，就全跑到楼下厨房里，去火炉边取暖。他赤脚跟在后面，在铺着石头的冰冰冷的过道里走了好几英里，跟它们争论，恳求它们通情达理一点。如果他不是睡过几个礼拜石板地铺稻草，快忘了厚毯子捂到下巴的温馨感觉，他可能还会醒得更早些。

他坐起来，先揉揉眼睛，然后揉揉正在诉苦的脚指头。有一会儿他很纳闷自己究竟身在何处，竟四下里张望，寻找熟悉的石墙和加铁栅的小窗，然后他心儿一阵狂跳，把一切都记起来了──逃出监狱，一路逃亡，遭到追捕。他记起了最最重要、最最好的一件事，那就是，他自由了！

自由！这一个念头两个字，就值五十条毯子。想着外面的快活世界，他从头到脚都暖和起来了：它正像厄运降临前那些老日子里一样，热切地等待他凯旋；它时刻准备着投他所好、为他效劳；它已经急不可耐地要给他帮助、同他做伴。他抖一抖身子，用手指梳理掉头发里的枯叶。梳洗完毕，他迈步走到那令人舒畅的朝阳下──虽然冷，却信心十足；虽然饿，却充满希望。昨天的紧张恐惧，全都被休息和睡眠，被真诚而且令人振奋的阳光，驱散了。

在这夏日的初晨，整个世界都属于他自己。他穿过缀满露珠的树林，树林里静悄悄空无一人。他来到树林外的绿色田野，田野只属于他一个，任凭他随心所欲。他走上马路，马路像四周每一处一样，寂寞冷清，如一只迷路的狗，仿佛正焦急地要找一个伴儿。可托德呢，他要找一个会说话的活物，清楚地告诉他该去哪个方向。如果你心情轻松，良心清白，兜里有钱，没有人在乡间到处搜查你，要把你拖走，送回监狱，你可以不在乎去哪里，只管顺着马路往前走，那倒是不错。可面对现实的托德当然是非常在乎的，现在对他来说，每分钟都很重要。但是马路却无可救药地不说话，他真想踹它几脚。

矜持的马路不久就有了一个害羞的小兄弟与它同行，它的形状是一条水渠。它挽着马路的手，在旁边缓缓地前行着，对马路百分之百地信赖，但对陌生人同样是一种舌头打结、沉默寡言的态度。“讨厌！”托德自言自语道，“可至少有一点很清楚：它们俩一定有个来处，也一定有个去处。这一点你不能不放在心上。托德，好样的！”于是，他耐心地沿着水渠大步往前走去。

水渠转个弯，过来了一匹孤独的马。他低垂着脑袋，脚步沉重缓慢地向前走着，好像心事很重。系在马轭上的缰绳被加长过，成了一根很长的绳子，绷得紧紧的。但马每跨出去一步，绳子就在水里蘸一下，绳子后面的部分滴着珍珠般的水珠。托德把马让过去，站在那里等着，看命运会给他送来什么。

平静的水面被船头搅起了一个令人愉快的漩涡，一艘宽头平底驳船徐徐行驶着，从旁边赶了上来。这艘船的船舷跟纤绳平齐，漆得艳丽花哨，唯一的占用者是一个大块头女人，她戴一顶亚麻布阔边遮阳帽，一条健壮的胳膊搁在舵柄上。

“一个晴朗的早晨，太太！”船赶上来跟托德平齐时，她招呼道。

“要我说，没错，太太！”托德彬彬有礼地答道，沿着纤路和她并排往前走，“要我说，一个人，如果没像我这样遇上麻烦，那对他来说，这确实是一个晴朗的早晨。我那个出嫁的女儿，送了急信来，叫我立刻去看她，所以我出来了。也不知道出了什么事，或者将要出什么事，就担心出现最坏的情况。太太，如果你也是当妈的，一定会理解。我把自己的营生丢下不管了──我干的是洗洗熨熨这一行，你一定看出来了，太太──还有几个小的丢在家里，让他们自个儿照顾自个儿，世上没有比他们更调皮捣蛋的淘气鬼了，太太。我把所有的钱都弄丢了，又迷了路，至于我出嫁的女儿出了什么事，嗨，我都不愿意去想，太太！”

“你出嫁的女儿住在哪里，太太？”船娘问。

“她家靠近大河，太太，”托德答道，“离一座名叫蛤蟆府的漂亮宅子不远，就在这一带什么地方吧。也许你听说过。”

“蛤蟆府？嗨，我正是去那个方向呢，”船娘答道，“再过去几英里，这条水渠就同大河汇合了，蛤蟆府就在那地方下游不远，走过去很容易。到船上来吧，我捎你一段。”

她把驳船行到岸边，托德低声下气地说了许多感恩的话，轻轻巧巧地跨上船去，满意至极地坐了下来。“托德的运气又来啦！”他心想，“我总是最棒的！”

“这么说，你是干洗衣行当的，太太？”船徐徐地前行着，船娘客客气气地说道，“要我说，你这一行也挺不错，我这样说不是太放肆吧？”

“全国最好的行当，”托德信口开河道，“所有的上等人都找我洗衣服，别人家就是倒贴钱他们也不去，他们非常信任我。你瞧，我对工作是很精通的，全都亲自去处理。洗、熨、上浆，整理绅士们晚会上穿的讲究衬衫，每一项工作都在我亲自监督下完成！”

“那些工作肯定不会都要你亲自动手干吧？”船娘恭敬地问。

“哦，有姑娘们干，”托德轻飘飘地说，“常年干活儿的姑娘有二十来个。可你知道姑娘们是些什么东西，太太！邋遢的小贱妇，我是这样叫她们的！”

“我也是，”船娘衷心地表示赞同，“可是要我说，你那帮姑娘一定被你整得规规矩矩吧，那帮子懒骨头烂货！你非常喜欢洗衣服吗？”

“我爱洗，”托德说，“简直就是太爱了。把两条胳膊往洗衣盆里一泡，我就感到再快活不过了。还有，衣服到我手里，洗起来很轻松！一点也不麻烦！一种真正的乐趣，请相信我，太太！”

“遇见你真是有点运气！”船娘若有所思地评论道，“我们俩都算交上了一点好运！”

“哟，你这是什么意思？”托德问，有点紧张。

“嗯，听我说，喏，”船娘答道，“我像你一样，也喜欢洗衣服。要说呢，像我这样到处跑，不管喜欢不喜欢，活儿自然全得自己干。要说我丈夫，他可是个偷懒不干活儿的家伙，而且把驳船丢给了我，弄得我没有一点工夫料理自个儿的事情。按理，现在他应该在这里，要么掌掌舵，要么管管马，幸好马够懂事，能管好自己。可他不来，带着狗出去了，看看能不能在哪里逮个兔子当晚饭。说是说他会在下一道船闸那里赶上我。嗳，那可没个准儿──他一带着狗出去，我就信不过他了，那狗比他还坏。可这样一来，我拿那些脏衣服怎么办呢？”

“哦，别管洗衣服的事啦，”托德说，他不喜欢这话题，“试试一心只想着兔子吧。我敢肯定，准是一只肥美的嫩兔子。你这里有洋葱吗？”

“我一心只想着洗衣服，别的事都没心思去想。”船娘说，“真纳闷，这样一幅快乐景象摆在面前，你还有心思说兔子。你找找看，船舱角落里有我一堆脏衣服。你就挑个一两件最急等着洗的──对你这样一位太太，我不想冒昧直说，但你只消瞄一眼就认出来了──丢到洗衣盆里，一边行船，一边洗。嗯，这对你来说是一种乐趣，就像你刚才说的；对我来说呢，是实实在在的帮忙。你找找看，洗衣盆就在附近，还有肥皂。水壶在炉子上，还有一只桶给你从水渠里打水。那样子，我就能看到你很愉快、很享受，不用像现在这样无聊地坐着，看看风景，哈欠连天。”

“嘿，你还是让我来掌舵吧！”托德说，吓坏了，“那样你就可以用自己的方法洗自己的衣服。我会把你的东西洗坏的，我的洗法你不喜欢。我本人更习惯洗先生们的衣服。那是我的特长。”

“让你掌舵？”船娘大笑着答复道，“给驳船掌好舵是要有些经验的。再说，这工作枯燥乏味，而我是想让你开开心。不，你还是做你喜欢做的事，去洗衣服吧。掌舵我在行，这活儿我盯着。好好款待你是我的快乐，别剥夺它！”

托德被逼到了墙角。他左顾右盼，想找个方向逃跑，却发现离岸边太远，一个飞跃够不着，只好闷闷不乐地听凭命运安排了。“到了这一步，”他绝望地想，“我看傻瓜也有本事洗衣服的！”

他从船舱里拿来洗衣盆和别的洗衣用品，随意挑了几件衣服，回忆着偶尔从洗衣房的窗户里瞥见过的情形，动手干起来。

长长的半小时过去了，这期间每过去一分钟，托德的火气就大一分。似乎无论他怎么弄，都无法讨那些衣物的欢心，把它们弄好。他哄它们，拍它们，用拳头砸它们，它们却以嬉皮笑脸来回报他，在盆中快乐地坚持着它们的原罪，毫不悔改。[1]他紧张地扭过头去看了船娘一两次，但她两只眼睛似乎只盯着前方，专心致志地掌舵。他背酸得厉害，并且惊恐地注意到，自己的两只爪子泡得全起了皱。这双爪子一向是托德引以为自豪的。他悄声嘀咕了几句既不该从洗衣妇也不该从癞蛤蟆嘴里说出来的话，第五十次把肥皂滑落了。

一阵爆笑声使他绷直了身子。环顾四周，只见船娘在仰天放声大笑，笑得眼泪滚下了腮帮子。

“我一直留神看着你，”她喘着气说，“看你那副骄傲自大的样子，自始至终我都觉得你一定是个骗子。装什么熟练的洗衣妇！我敢打赌，这辈子你连一块擦盘子的抹布都没洗过！”

托德一肚子的怨愤早已经憋着炖了好一会儿，这时咕噜噜开了锅，完全失去了控制。

“你这个粗野、下贱的肥猪船娘！”他吼道，“竟敢这样对老子说话！洗衣妇个鬼！我要让你知道知道，我是一只癞蛤蟆，一只大名鼎鼎、受人尊敬、高贵显赫的癞蛤蟆！眼下也许我有点失势，可也轮不上一个船娘来嘲笑我！”

那女人凑近他，用锐利的目光仔细端详着女帽下他那张脸。“哟，果然是只癞蛤蟆！”她嚷道，“咳，真没想到！一只叫人恶心、浑身起鸡皮疙瘩的癞蛤蟆！居然在我的漂亮干净的驳船上！我可容不下这样一个烂玩意儿。”

她把舵柄丢开片刻，一条长斑点的大胳膊箭一样抄过来，抓住托德一条前腿，另一只手夹住了他一条后腿。于是，世界突然上下翻转，驳船仿佛轻盈地从天空掠过，风在耳边啸响，托德发现自己腾空飞起，一边飞，一边快速地旋转。

当他最后到达水中，很响亮地溅起一片水花时，水证明了自己够凉，很合他的口味。不过，那凉意仍然不足以平息他的骄傲气焰，浇灭他的狂暴怒火。他浮上水面，喷溅出一片水花。擦去眼睛上的浮萍后，他第一眼看到的是，肥胖的船娘正从远去的驳船的船尾回望着他，笑个不停。他一边咳着呛着，一边发誓，要向她报复。

他扑打着水向岸边游去，但是棉布罩衫很碍事。当他终于碰到岸沿时，却发现它太陡。没人扶一把，爬上去好难呀，他只好歇一两分钟，缓一口气。然后，他把湿裙子捞在手上，以他最快的速度，拔腿去追驳船。他已经愤怒得发了狂，一心只想着报仇雪恨。

当他追到和船并排时，船娘还在笑个不停。“把你自己丢进轧布机里轧一轧，洗衣妇，”她喊道，“熨一熨你的脸，压出些褶子，出来的就是一只十分体面的癞蛤蟆了！”

托德没有停下脚步答理她。虽然他肚子里有一两句很想回敬她的话，但他想要的是实实在在的报复，而不是廉价、空洞的口头上的胜利。他看到了前面想要的那样东西。他不停地飞跑着，赶上那匹马，解开纤绳扔掉，轻轻一跃，跨上马背，使劲儿一踢马肚子，催马飞奔。他策马离开纤路，驰入空旷的乡间，拨转马头，上了一条布满车辙的林荫小路。他回头望了一眼，看见驳船在靠近对岸的水面上搁了浅，打着转。船娘在疯狂地比划着，大喊：“停下，停下，停下！”“我以前听过人家这样唱歌。”托德大笑着说，继续策马向前狂奔。

给驳船拉纤的马是没有脚力持续猛跑很长时间的。不久速度就降下来了，疾驰变成小跑，小跑又变成了踱步。但托德仍然十分满意，因为他知道，无论如何，自己还是在行进着，驳船却已经动弹不了。既然他干出了一件在他看来实在聪明的事，他的心情就好多了。他努力忘掉自己已经很久没有正儿八经吃上一顿饭，勒着马走上偏僻小路和马道，心满意足地在太阳底下安安静静慢跑着，终于把水渠远远地甩在了后面。

他和马已经跑出去好几英里，在热烘烘的阳光里，昏昏欲睡。这时，马停住脚步，低下头去啃吃青草，托德因此惊醒过来，正好来得及做个自救的动作，没摔下马背。他看了看四周，发现自己停在一块公地上，目力所及之处全都点缀着一小片一小片的金雀花和黑莓。离他不远处停着一辆褪色泛黄的吉卜赛大篷车，车子旁边有一个人坐在倒扣的水桶上，正忙着抽烟、眺望广阔世界。那人近旁燃着一堆用枯枝生的火，火堆上方吊着一口铁锅，锅里响着啵啵啵咕咕咕的冒泡声，冒着勾引人的模模糊糊的蒸汽。还有许多气味──暖暖、浓浓的混杂气味──缠缠绕绕，交融在一起，最终合成了一种十全十美、闻了舒服无比的香味，仿佛大自然的灵魂显了形，让她的孩子们见到了一位真正的女神，一个带来安慰和舒适的母亲。托德现在明白了，他以前从来没有真正感到过饥饿。那一天他早先的感觉只不过是一种轻微的不舒服。现在，真正的饥饿终于来了，肯定没错，而且得赶紧对付它，否则就会给某人或某物带来麻烦。他上上下下、仔仔细细把吉卜赛人打量了一番，心里面含含糊糊，不知道跟对方动拳头容易呢，还是耍嘴皮子容易。于是，托德坐在马上，鼻子不断地嗅着，眼睛看着吉卜赛人。吉卜赛人坐在桶上，嘴里抽着烟，眼睛看着托德。

吉卜赛人把烟斗从嘴里拿开，做出一副漫不经心的样子，说道：“想卖掉你那匹马？”

托德完全没料到这个，吃了一惊。他不知道，吉卜赛人都很喜欢做马匹交易，从不错过一次机会。他不明白，大篷车是一直在走动的，需要马来拉。他从没想到把马变成现钱，不过，吉卜赛人的建议似乎铺平了一条道，通向他急需的两样东西──现钱和一顿丰盛的早餐。

“什么？”他说，“让我卖掉这匹年轻漂亮的马？哦，不。这件事免谈。卖了马，每个礼拜谁来驮我为顾客洗的衣服？再说，我忒喜欢他了，他也跟我亲得要命。”

“试试喜欢上一头驴，”吉卜赛人提议道，“有人就用驴子。”

“你好像没看出来，”托德接着说道，“我这匹骏马给你根本就是大材小用。他是一匹纯种马，部分是的，当然，是你没看出来的那部分，另一部分。他是从海克尼[2]出来的，当年还得过奖。他走红的时候你还不认识他，不过，如果你多少有点识马，还是一眼就能看出来的。不，卖马的事想也别想。也罢，你真想要我这匹年轻漂亮的马的话，考虑出个什么价？”

吉卜赛人把马上上下下打量了一番，接着同样仔细地上上下下打量了一番托德，然后又重新把马打量了一回。“一先令一条腿，”说完他转过脸去，一边继续抽他的烟，一边盯着广阔世界看，要看得她[3]发窘。

“一先令一条腿？”托德嚷道，“请等一等，给我点时间算一算，看看总共是多少。”

他从马背上爬下来，丢下马让他自个儿去吃草，自己在吉卜赛人旁边坐下，扳着手指算起来。最后他说：“一先令一条腿？哟，总共正好是四先令，就这么多。哦，不，这匹年轻漂亮的马卖四先令我可不干。”

“好吧，”吉卜赛人说，“我把底牌亮给你。我给你加到五先令，这价码已经比那动物的价值多出三先令六便士。这是我的最后出价。”

托德坐在那里盘算了好久。他肚子很饿，身无分文，离家还有一段路──他不知道究竟多远──而且敌人可能仍然在找他。对这种处境中的人来说，五先令满可以看作不少的一笔钱。再转念一想，一匹马卖这几个钱似乎少了点。可是话又说回来，那匹马没花他一个子儿，所以无论卖到多少钱都是净赚。最后，他坚定地说：“听我说，吉卜赛人！我把我们的底牌摊开来吧，这是我的最后要价。你给我六先令六便士，要现钱。另外，作为附加条件，你供我一顿早饭，让我敞开了吃，当然，只吃一顿。就是你那只铁锅里一直在冒着馋人香气的东西。作为回报，我把我这匹精力充沛的年轻马转让给你，外带他身上所有的漂亮挽具和饰物，免费赠送。如果你觉得不太合算，就直说，我走我的路。我认识这附近的一个人，他想要我这匹马已经好几年了。”

吉卜赛人发了一通很吓人的牢骚，说什么再做几桩这样的交易他就要倾家荡产。可说完之后他就从裤兜最底下拽出一个脏兮兮的帆布钱袋，数出六先令六便士放到托德的爪子里。然后他钻进大篷车里消失了片刻，拿出来一个大铁盘子，一副刀叉匙勺。他把锅子一倾斜，一股子热腾腾、外表壮观、内容丰富的炖菜流进了铁盘子里。事实上，那是世界上最出色的炖菜，是把山鹑、野鸡、家鸡、野兔、家兔、雌孔雀、珍珠鸡和一两样别的东西一起放在锅里炖出来的。托德接过盘子，放在膝上，差一点哭出来。他一个劲儿地狼吞虎咽、狼吞虎咽、狼吞虎咽，不断地要求再添一点、再添一点，吉卜赛人却也并未说一句嫌恶他的话。托德觉得，他一辈子从来不曾吃过这么美的一顿早餐。

炖菜有的是，托德一直吃到觉得再也吃不下为止，然后他站起身来，跟吉卜赛人说了再见，也依依不舍地和马道了别。吉卜赛人对河边地形很熟悉，指点给他该走的路线，他就在最好的精神状态下，重新上路了。说实在的，他已经跟一小时前的托德判若两个动物。太阳闪耀着明亮的光芒，湿衣服已经差不多晒干，口袋里重新有了钱，距离家、朋友和安全越来越近了。最棒最重要的是，饱饱地吃了一顿，浑身热乎乎的，营养充足，他感到无忧无虑，强大而自信。

他欢欢喜喜地一路走去，心里想着自己如何冒险、如何逃脱、如何逢凶化吉、遇难呈祥，那股子骄傲自大的劲儿又在心里膨胀起来。“嚯，嚯，”他一边昂起下巴大步往前走，一边自言自语，“我是一只多么聪明的癞蛤蟆呀！全世界肯定没有一只动物聪明程度及得上我！敌人把我关进监牢，哨兵围了几层，看守日夜监视，我全凭着才智加勇气，从他们眼皮子底下走了出来。他们乘着火车头，带上警察和左轮手枪来追我。我打个响指，大笑一声，他们就消失得无影无踪。我不幸被一个身体肥胖、心地恶毒的女人扔进水渠。结果怎样？我游上岸来，逮住她的马，骑着他得胜而去。我用马换来满满一口袋钱币，还有一顿很棒的早餐！嚯，嚯！我是癞蛤蟆托德，英俊的公众人物，成功人士托德！”他自负得飘飘然如腾云驾雾，不禁边走边编了一首赞美自己的歌，扯直嗓门唱起来，虽然除了他自己无人听见。这也许是动物编出来的歌里面最最自高自大的了：





世上有过伟大的英雄，

如同历史书所载所叙；

但流芳百世的名字中

没一个能和托德相比！





牛津大学聪明的人们

知道一切该知道的事物。

但他们的知识没一个及得上

大才子托德先生的半数！





动物们坐在方舟里哭泣，

他们的脸上泪水纵横。

是谁指明：“前面有陆地”？

是鼓舞人心的托德先生！





军队在大路上齐步行进，

他们齐刷刷行礼致敬。

向谁？国王还是基钦纳[4]？

不，是向着托德先生。





女王和她的侍从女官们

坐在窗前缝衣。她嚷道：

“看，那英俊男子是谁？”

她们回答：“是托德先生。”





这种词还有好多好多，但是狂妄自大得太可怕了，不宜写下来。上面几段是里面比较温和的。

他边走边唱，边唱边走，一分钟比一分钟自我膨胀。但是很快，他的傲气就要一落千丈了。

走过几英里林荫小路后，到了公路边。他拐上公路，沿着长长的白色路面一眼望去，看见远处一个小黑点正向他这边移动，接着变成了一个大黑点，接着变成了一个小团团，接着变成了一样十分熟悉的东西。然后，两声表示警告的鸣笛传进了他愉快的耳朵：没别的，太熟悉了。

“这才像样！”托德激动地说，“真正的生活回来了，又来到了我思念好久的伟大世界里！我要招呼他们，叫那些车轮上的兄弟们停一停，编个故事哄哄他们，就用目前为止一直很管用的那个故事。他们自然会捎我一程，我就再给他们编些故事。运气好的话，最后也许能开着汽车进蛤蟆府！那才叫班杰开眼呢！”

他自信地走到路中央，招呼汽车停下。它从容地驶过来，靠近林荫小路路口时减缓了速度。这时他突然脸色煞白，一颗心化成了水，两只膝盖哆哆嗦嗦直往下坍，身子伛起来，五脏六腑一阵翻江倒海似的难受，一下子他就垮了。那不幸的动物这个样子并不是无缘无故，因为驶近的汽车正是那要命的一天他从红狮客栈院子里偷走的那一辆。他所有的麻烦都是从那一天开始的！车子里的人正是那一天他坐在咖啡室里边吃午饭边观看的那一伙！

他瘫软成一堆惨兮兮的破烂，倒在路上，在绝望中自言自语地嘀咕着：“全完了！一切都结束了！重新落到警察手里，戴上镣铐！再进监狱！又要吃面包加白水了！噢，我真是个大傻瓜！我干吗要趾高气扬在乡间到处晃荡，唱着狂妄自大的歌，大白天在公路上招呼人家哟。我干吗不躲到天黑下来，从僻静的小路，静悄悄地溜回家去！哦，倒霉蛋托德！哦，厄运当头的动物！”

可怕的汽车慢慢开过来，越驶越近，最后吱的一声，在差一点就要碰到他的地方停了下来。两位绅士下了车，绕着躺在路上的这一堆皱巴巴、惨兮兮、瑟瑟发抖的东西转悠。一位绅士说：“天哪！真叫人难过！这里有位可怜的老人家──看来是个洗衣妇──晕倒在路上了！也许她是中暑了，可怜的人，也可能她今天没吃过东西。我们把她抬上车，送到离这里最近的村子里，她在那里肯定有朋友。”

他们轻手轻脚把托德抬进汽车，用柔软的垫子支着他坐起来，继续赶路。

托德听见他们说话的口吻那么友好、充满同情，知道自己没有被识破，他的胆子又开始壮起来了。他小心翼翼地先睁开一只眼睛，又睁开了第二只。

“看！”一位绅士说，“她已经好些了。新鲜空气对她有好处。你现在感觉怎样，太太？”

“谢谢你，好心的先生，”托德用虚弱的声音说，“我觉得好多了！”

“那就好，”绅士说，“现在保持安静，最重要的是别说话。”

“我不说话，”托德说，“我只是在想，如果可以坐到前排，坐在司机旁边，满脸都能吹到新鲜空气，我会很快就好的。”

“头脑多清楚的女人！”绅士说，“当然可以。”于是，他们小心地扶着托德坐到前排司机旁边，然后继续赶路。

托德现在差不多恢复了常态。他坐直身子，看看左右，想击退心中的兴奋、渴望和老瘾头。它们起来了，不断围攻着他，完全控制住了他。

“这是命呀！”他对自己说，“干吗抗争？干吗挣扎？”他把脸转过去，对着身旁的司机。

“我求你件事，先生，”他说，“让我试试，开一会儿车子。我一直仔细看着你开，好像很容易又很有趣，我希望能对朋友们说，我开过一回汽车！”

这提议把司机逗笑了，他笑得那么开怀，那位绅士便问怎么回事。他听完说了一番让托德高兴的话：“好哇，太太！我喜欢你的勇气。让她试试吧，在旁边看着点。她不会闯祸的。”

托德急不可耐地挤过去，坐到司机让出来的驾驶座上，将方向盘握在手里，假装很谦虚地听着别人的指点，发动了汽车。不过，一开始他开得很慢，因为他决心谨慎一些。

后面的绅士们鼓掌喝彩，托德听见他们在说：“她开得多好啊！想不到一个洗衣妇开车这么棒，第一回见识！”

托德开快了一点，又快了一点，越来越快。

他听见绅士们大声警告：“小心点，洗衣妇！”这话惹恼了他，他开始头脑发昏。

司机想插手，但他用一只胳膊肘把司机摁在座位上不能动，将车速加到了顶。扑在脸上的气流、引擎的嗡鸣、身子下面车厢的轻轻弹跳，把他那容易发昏的大脑醉得晕晕乎乎。“洗衣妇个鬼！”他不顾一切地大叫起来，“嚯！嚯！我是癞蛤蟆托德，抢车的窃贼，越狱的囚犯，永远能逃脱的癞蛤蟆托德！安安静静地坐着吧，你们会知道什么才是真正的驾驶，因为你们是在名声赫赫、技艺高超、天不怕地不怕的托德手里！”

那伙人惊心动魄一声喊，站起来，全体扑到他身上。“抓住他！”他们喊道，“抓住癞蛤蟆托德，偷我们汽车的坏动物！把他绑起来，铐起来，拉到最近的警局去！打倒亡命之徒危险分子托德！”

唉！他们本该动动脑子，他们本该谨慎一些，他们本该记着先想办法停下车子，然后再上演这样一场闹剧：方向盘转过去半圈，癞蛤蟆托德送车子哗啦啦冲过了公路沿边的矮树篱。它猛地一跳，狠狠地一撞，掉进一个饮马塘，轮子就在里面搅起厚泥浆来。

托德发现自己往上一蹿，像燕子一样划一道优美的弧线，飞上了天。他喜欢这动作，正开始纳闷会不会继续飞，最后长出翅膀，变成一只癞蛤蟆鸟，却已经砰的一声仰面朝天着了地，落在一块草质柔软茂密的草甸子上。他坐起来，刚好还能看见池塘里的汽车，它几乎已经淹没在水中。几位绅士和司机，被长长的外套拖累着，正不由自主地在水中扑腾。

他飞快地爬起来，撒腿就跑。他使出最大的劲儿，钻过树篱，冲过田野，直跑得上气不接下气，累得放慢脚步慢悠悠地走。等到稍稍缓过气来，能定下心来想一想时，他咯咯地笑起来，又从咯咯傻笑发展到哈哈大笑，直笑得站不住，一屁股坐到树篱下面。“嚯，嚯！”他陶醉在自我欣赏之中，喊叫着，“还是托德！托德，像往常一样，最棒的！是谁骗他们让他搭车的？是谁借口要呼吸新鲜空气，设法坐到前排去的？是谁说服他们让他试试看能不能开车的？是谁让他们全都掉进饮马塘的？是谁快活地飞起来，毫发无伤地腾空逃走，将那帮心胸狭窄、记人前仇、胆小怕事的游客丢在正该他们待的泥浆里面不管的？嗨，当然是托德。聪明的托德，伟大的托德，善良的托德！”

接着，他突然就又唱起歌来，拉直了嗓门哇啦哇啦地唱：





汽车开起来噗噗噗，

沿大路向前飞奔。

是谁把它开进了池塘？

聪明能干的托德先生！





“我多么聪明啊！聪明啊，聪明啊，聪明啊……”

后面很远的地方传来微弱的喧闹声，引得他回过头去看：恐怖啊！悲惨啊！绝望啊！

只见从大约两块田以外，一个扎着皮绑腿的司机和两个大块头乡村警察，正使足了劲儿向他奔过来！

可怜的托德蹦起来，再一次开始仓皇逃窜，他的心提到了喉咙口。“哦，天！”他气喘吁吁地一边跑，一边说，“我真是头驴！一头自高自大、冒冒失失的驴！又得意忘形了！又大喊大叫大唱起来了！又坐着不动胡吹乱侃了！哦，天！哦，天！哦，天！”

他向后瞄了一眼，很沮丧地看到他们越追越近。他拼死地往前跑，又不断地往后看，看到他们不断地逼近。他使出了最大的劲儿拼命跑，但他是一只肥胖的动物，腿又短，所以他们一直在逼近。现在他听得出来，他们已经追到身后不远处了。他再也不管东南西北，发了狂似的盲目乱窜，一边还回头看那几个马上就要得胜的敌人，突然，脚下的地坍了下去，他的手在空中乱抓乱挠，紧接着，噗通！他发现自己淹没在水里：深深的水，湍急的水，以不可抗拒的力量挟带着他奔流向前的水。他明白过来了：自己慌不择路，盲目乱窜，一头栽进了大河！

他浮上水面，想抓住河岸下面贴着水边生长的芦苇和灯芯草，可是水流的力量太大，把他抓到手里的草夺走了。“哦，天！”可怜的托德气喘吁吁地说，“要是我再偷一辆汽车！要是我再唱一首自高自大的歌……”话没说完他就沉了下去，然后浮上来，上气不接下气，嘴巴里直往外喷水。他就看见自己正接近河岸上一个大黑洞，就在他头顶上。当水流挟带着他从旁经过时，他举起一只爪子，抓住洞的边沿，抓牢了。然后，他很吃力地把自己慢慢拽出水面，两只胳膊肘支在洞的边沿上。好几分钟，他就这样待着不动，呼哧呼哧直喘气，因为他实在是精疲力竭了。

他正叹息着，喘着粗气，盯着眼前黑乎乎的洞向里面张望，就看见一个亮晶晶的小东西在洞的深处闪烁着，向他移动过来。当它来到近前时，一张脸渐渐地在它周围显现出来，一张熟悉的脸！

一张棕色的小脸，长着胡须。

一张严肃的圆脸，玲珑的耳朵，丝绸一样的毛发。

是水鼠兰特！

第十一章　泪如夏日暴雨


水鼠兰特伸出一只整洁的棕色小爪子，紧紧抓住托德的颈背，使出好大的劲儿往上拽。在水里泡得沉甸甸的托德，很缓慢但是稳稳当当地升到了洞口边沿，翻上去，安然无恙地站在了门厅里。自然，他身上沾着一道道污泥和水草，直往下淌水，但他又像往日一样幸福快乐、兴致勃勃了，因为他又来到了朋友家里，逃亡已经结束，那一身与他的身份太不相符、太不般配的伪装，可以扔掉了。

“哦，鼠仔！”他嚷道，“自从上次和你分手以后，我经历了好多事情，你没法想象！那样的磨难，那样的苦难，全都被我那么高贵勇敢地扛住了！然后是化装逃跑、耍花招逃脱，都是我聪明地计划和实施出来！进监狱──逃出来，当然！被扔进水渠──游上岸！偷一匹马──卖了一大笔钱！把每一个人都骗了──让他们全都照我的意思去做！啊，我确确实实是一只聪明伶俐的癞蛤蟆，没错！你猜我的最后一项英勇业绩是什么？别着急，听我慢慢讲来……”

“托德，”水鼠兰特严肃而坚决地说，“你立刻给我上楼去，脱掉这件好像是洗衣妇穿过的破烂旧棉布衫，把自己浑身上下洗干净，穿上我的衣服。如果没问题的话，下楼来时要像个绅士。我一辈子从没见过谁像你现在这样湿漉漉、黏糊糊，衣衫褴褛，丢人现眼！打住，别自吹自擂了，别争辩，快去！待会儿我有话跟你说！”

一开始托德不愿意动，还想回敬他几句。坐牢的时候人家对他颐指气使，他已经受够了，现在还要对他再来这一套，而且是一只鼠！可是，隔着衣帽架，他不经意地从镜子里看到了自己的模样，还有那顶很别致地扣住他一只眼睛的褪色黑女帽。他就改变了主意，快快地、温温顺顺地上了楼，来到水鼠兰特的梳妆室里。他彻彻底底地洗了一遍，梳理了一番，换好衣服，在镜子前面站了很长时间，很得意很开心地端详着自己，心想：谁把我错当成洗衣妇，哪怕只是一会会儿，他也肯定是个十足的白痴。

托德回到楼下时，午饭已经在桌上摆好，他看见了很高兴，因为吃过吉卜赛人提供的那一顿特棒的早餐后，他有过一些磨炼人的经历，做过许多剧烈的运动。他们一边吃，托德一边给水鼠兰特讲他所有的冒险事迹，主要强调他自己多么聪明，危急时脑子好使，困境中诡计多端。他的那一番遭遇，反而被他说成了一次轻松愉快、色彩缤纷的经历。但他说得越多，吹得越厉害，水鼠兰特就越是神情严肃、沉默不语。

托德一个人说呀说，终于住了嘴。沉默片刻之后，水鼠兰特说话了：“喏，蛤蟆仔，你已经吃了那么多苦，我不想再给你添烦恼。可是说真的，你就没看出来，你把自己变成了一头多么蠢的驴吗？你自己招认了，你戴手铐，蹲大牢，忍饥挨饿，遭到追捕，吓得死去活来，受人侮辱和嘲笑，被人很丢面子地扔进河里──而且是被一个女人！这里面哪里来的乐趣？有什么好玩的地方？全都因为你偏偏要去偷一辆汽车。你心里明白，自从你第一眼看到汽车后，它们给你带来的只有麻烦。你既然愿意同它们搅和在一起──你总是五分钟就能爱上一个新花样──干吗又要去偷呢？如果你觉得腿瘸了刺激，那就做瘸子好了；要是你想换换口味，一心要倾家荡产，那就破产好了。干吗偏要去做囚犯？什么时候你才会理智些，能够考虑到朋友们，给他们增点光？比如，我在外面走动时，听到动物们说我就是那个与囚犯为伍的家伙，你觉得我心里面会很高兴吗？”

喏，在托德性格中，有一点是非常令人欣慰的：他是一只心地十分善良的动物，只要是真正的朋友，再怎么数落他也从不介意。哪怕是在他最痴迷一样东西的时候，他也总是能看到问题的另一面。所以呀，在水鼠兰特那么严肃地数落他时，他虽然很不服气，一直在自言自语：“可是确实很好玩！好玩得要命！”并且压低了嗓门，暗自发出一些怪声音：“嘁──咔──咔──咔，噗──呜──呜──呜”还弄出一些类似捏着鼻子喷鼻息和撬开苏打水瓶盖的声响，但是，当水鼠兰特差不多说完时，他深深地叹了口气，很拘谨很谦虚地说：“十分正确，鼠仔！你说得总是那么合情合理！是的，我十分清楚，我是一头自高自大的老驴子。但现在我要做一只好癞蛤蟆，再也不做驴子了。至于汽车，自从最后我一头扎进你这条河里，我对汽车已经完全不像以前那么热心了。其实，我吊在你的洞口边沿喘过气来的时候，突然有了一个想法──真正绝妙的想法──跟摩托艇有关的──得，得！别生那么大气，老家伙，莫跺脚，别再把东西打翻喽。这只是个想法，现在不提它行了吧。我们喝杯咖啡，再来支烟，安安静静聊一会儿，然后我就安安静静溜达回蛤蟆府去，换上我自己的衣服，让一切回到原来的轨道上去。我已经冒险够了。我要过一种平静、稳定、受人尊敬的生活，慢悠悠地经营经营我的产业，作些改进，偶尔弄弄花草，美化美化景观。朋友们来看我时，总是有饭菜招待的。我要备一辆小型轻便马车，乘着它到乡间各处转悠转悠，就像在过去的好日子里那样。我再不会心浮气躁，老想着搞事情了。”

“安安静静溜达回蛤蟆府去？”水鼠兰特嚷道，激动得要命，“你在说什么呀？听这意思，你还没听说吗？”

“听说什么？”托德问，脸变得煞白，“说下去，鼠仔！快说！别顾惜我！我没听说什么？”

“你不会告诉我，”水鼠兰特用小拳头擂着桌子，大喊大叫，“白鼬和黄鼠狼的事你一点都没听说吧？”

“什么，野树林那帮子？”托德嚷道，四肢打着哆嗦，“不，一个字都没听说！他们干了些什么？”

“你没听说他们怎样占了蛤蟆府？”水鼠兰特接着说。

托德把胳膊肘支在桌上，两只爪子托住下巴，两只眼睛里各涌上来一汪泪水，它们夺眶而出，摔在桌上，啪嗒！啪嗒！

“接着说，鼠仔，”他就喃喃地说，“全都告诉我。最坏的事已经过去。我已经找回了自己。我挺得住。”

“你遇上那件……那件……麻烦事以后，”水鼠兰特说得很慢，很感人，“我是说，你从社交界消失了一段时间，为了那个误会，关于一台……一台机器，你知道的……”

托德只点点头。

“嗯，自然，这一带大家议论纷纷，”水鼠兰特接着说，“不光是沿河一带，连野树林那边也是。动物们照例分成两派。河边的居民都支持你，说他们那样对待你很可耻，如今这国家真是找不着公理了。野树林那帮子动物却说得很难听，他们说你活该，是时候制止你的胡作非为了。他们趾高气扬，到处讲你这回完蛋了！你永远不会回来了，永远，永远！”

托德又点点头，一言不发。

“那帮小动物就是这德行，”水鼠兰特继续往下说，“可莫尔和班杰呢，他们却和你风雨同舟，一口咬定你很快就会回来，总有办法回来的。他们并不知道你究竟怎样回来，但说你总有办法回来！”

托德在椅子里重新坐直身子，脸上露出一丝得意的笑容。

“他们用历史事实来证明，”水鼠兰特接着说道，“他们说，像你这样一只没脸没皮、巧言善辩的动物，加上大钱包的力量，没有一条已知的刑法能把你打倒。他们就收拾收拾行李，搬进了蛤蟆府，睡在那里，让房子保持通风，把一切准备妥当，只等你回来。当然啦，他们猜不到后来发生的事，可对野树林那帮子动物还是有戒心的。现在我要说事情最令人悲痛的部分了。一个黑咕隆咚的夜晚──那真是一个漆黑漆黑的夜，还刮着大风，那雨哦，简直像泼下来的一样。一帮子武装到牙齿的黄鼠狼，悄悄沿着马车道摸到了前门。同时，一伙雪貂[1]通过菜园子开进去，占领了后院和处理家事的各个房间。另外，一群肆无忌惮的白鼬，打打闹闹占据了暖房和台球室，把守住了面对草坪的法式窗户。

“莫尔和班杰正在吸烟室里，坐在炉火旁讲故事，一点都没起疑心，因为那样一个夜晚是不适合动物出来入侵的。就在这个时候，那些凶残的暴徒砸开门，从四面八方向他们扑来。他俩尽力抵抗了一阵，可有什么用呢？他们没有武器，而且是遭到了偷袭。两只动物对几百只，能有什么结果？那两个忠实可靠的可怜生灵，被他们抓住，用棍子打，用许多没来由的话辱骂，被赶到冰冷的屋外淋雨。”

听到这里，没心没肺的托德忍不住扑哧一声笑，然后又正襟危坐，装出一副特别严肃的神情。

“从此，野树林那帮家伙就住进了蛤蟆府，”水鼠兰特接着往下说，“日子过得乱七八糟！大白天有半天时间躺在床上，吃早饭不管时间，把府里弄得一塌糊涂（我听说的）、不堪入目！吃你的，喝你的，用恶劣的笑话编排你，唱粗俗下流的歌，唱些──嗯，监狱、法官、警察什么的，都是些骂人的歌，讨厌得要命，一点也不幽默。他们对做生意的人说，见人就说，说他们来了就不走了，永远待下去了。”

“哦，他们敢！”托德说，站起身来，抄起一根棍子，“我倒是很高兴马上去看看他们怎么个待法！”

“没用的，托德！”水鼠兰特冲着他的背影喊道，“你还是回来坐下吧。你去只会招惹麻烦。”

可癞蛤蟆托德已经走了，叫也叫不住。他沿着大路快速前进，棍子扛在肩上，怒气冲冲，边走边气哼哼地喃喃自语。当他快走到正门口时，突然从木栅栏后面冒出来一只长腰黄色雪貂，手里端着一杆枪。

“来的是什么人？”雪貂厉声喝问。

“废话！”托德非常气愤地说。

“你敢这样对我说话，想怎么样？立刻给我滚出来，否则我……”

雪貂一个字也不回答，只把枪抵在肩头。托德还算精明，一下子趴倒在路上，砰！一颗子弹从他头顶上呼啸而过。

受了惊吓的托德爬起来就往回跑，沿着来路连蹦带跳，能跑多快跑多快。他一边跑一边听到雪貂的笑声，还有一些可怕的尖细的笑声在跟着起哄。

他垂头丧气地跑回来，把经过告诉了水鼠兰特。

“我是怎么对你说的？”水鼠兰特说，“不管用。他们有哨兵站岗，他们全都有武器。你必须等待。”

可托德不肯马上认输。他把船弄出来，划向上游蛤蟆府花园前沿的河边。一到能看到老宅的地方，他就趴在桨上，仔细观察岸上的情形。似乎一切都很平静，不见一个人影。他能看到蛤蟆府的整个正面，看见它辉映着夕阳的光芒。鸽子三三两两，栖息在笔直的屋顶轮廓线上；花朵满园，如同火焰；通往停船棚屋的小河湾里，横跨河湾的小木桥上，一片宁静，杳无人迹，显然在等待他归来。他心想，先去停船棚屋看看吧。他很小心地把船划到河湾口，正要从桥下通过，这时……哗啦！

从上面掉下来一块大石头，把船底砸了个洞。水涌进来，船沉了，托德发现自己在很深的水中挣扎。仰脸望去，只见两只白鼬身子探过桥栏杆，看着他，乐坏了。“下回砸烂的就是你的脑袋，蛤蟆仔！”他们向他喊叫着。气愤的托德游上了岸，两只白鼬却笑啊笑，笑得抱成一团，又笑啊笑，直笑得差一点晕过去两回──当然啦，确切地说，一人一回。

癞蛤蟆托德有气无力地靠两条腿走回去，又对水鼠兰特讲了一次令人扫兴的经历。

“咳，我是怎么对你说的？”水鼠兰特很不高兴地说，“这下好了吧！瞧瞧你干的好事！把我那么喜爱的船弄没了，这就是你的成就！就知道弄坏我借给你的一套好衣服！说真的，托德，你是一只顶顶折磨人的动物──真不知道你还能不能留得住一个朋友！”

癞蛤蟆托德立刻明白了自己的行为有多么错误和愚蠢。他承认自己做错了，头脑犯了浑。他为自己丢船、弄坏衣服向兰特说了一大堆道歉的话。他爽爽快快地甘愿举手投降，这样做总是能化解朋友们的怨气，让他们回心转意的。就这样，他说了一番话作为了结：“鼠仔！我明白了，我一意孤行，是一只任性的癞蛤蟆！相信我，从今以后，我会谦虚谨慎，乖乖听话。没有你们的忠告，不经过你们完全同意，绝不擅自行动！”

“如果真是这样，”和善的兰特已经消了气，他说，“那我给你的忠告就是，现在时间已经不早了，坐下来吃晚饭，过一分钟饭菜就上桌，耐心等待。因为我确信，我们什么也不能干，得先见到鼹鼠莫尔和獾子班杰，听听他们的最新消息，开个会，看看他们在这件棘手的事情上有什么意见。”

“哦，是啊，当然啦，鼹鼠莫尔和獾子班杰，”托德轻飘飘地说，“那两个亲爱的家伙，他们怎么样？瞧我把他们忘了个一干二净。”

“亏你还好意思问！”水鼠兰特责备道，“你开着豪华汽车满世界兜风，骑着纯种马神气活现地奔驰，吃着山珍海味的早饭。那两个可怜的忠诚的动物，却不论刮风下雨，都在外面露宿，白天受苦，晚上遭罪，替你守望房子，巡察地界，不断地监视着白鼬和黄鼠狼，费心思筹谋策划，想替你夺回产业。你不配有这样真诚忠实的朋友，托德，你真的不配。将来有一天，你会后悔当初没有好好珍惜他们，到那时候就晚了！”

“我是个忘恩负义的畜生，我知道，”托德呜咽道，流下了酸楚的泪，“让我出去找他们，在寒冷漆黑的夜里，去外面分担他们的艰辛，我要证明──等一下！我听到了餐具碰托盘的声音，不会错！晚餐终于上来了，万岁！快来吧，鼠仔！”

水鼠兰特记着可怜的托德吃了好长时间牢饭，所以饭菜的量准备得很多。他跟着托德来到餐桌旁，热情地鼓励他放开了吃，补偿一下前段时间吃的亏。

他们刚吃完饭，坐回到扶手椅里，就听见响起了重重的敲门声。

托德有些紧张，但水鼠兰特很神秘地冲他点了一下头，就径直走过去把门打开。班杰先生走了进来。

他的模样完全像是一个好多个晚上没进过家门的人，好久没享受过家里的各种小小的舒适和方便。他鞋子上沾满了泥，衣裳凌乱，蓬头垢面。话说回来，獾子班杰最体面的时候也从来不是一个非常整洁的人。他庄严地走到托德跟前，和他握握爪子，说道：“欢迎回家，托德！唉！我说些什么呀？家个鬼哟！这个家回得好惨。不幸的托德！”说完他背过身去，将椅子拉近些，在桌旁坐下，拿起一大片冷馅饼吃了起来。

这种欢迎风格很严肃、很不祥，让托德十分惊惶。水鼠兰特悄声对他说：“别在意，别往心里去，现在什么也不要对他说。他肚里没食的时候，情绪总是有几分低落的。半小时后，他就会完全变个样。”

于是，他们静静地等待着，不久，又响起了一阵比较轻的敲门声。水鼠兰特冲托德点了一下头，跑到门口，把鼹鼠莫尔迎了进来。莫尔也是衣裳破烂，邋里邋遢，皮毛上还沾着些干草和稻草。

“万岁！这不是老托德吗！”鼹鼠莫尔嚷道，脸上放出光来，“没想到你这就回来了！”他围着他跳起了舞。“做梦也没想到，这么快你就出现在我们面前！你一定是想办法逃出来的，你这只聪明机灵的癞蛤蟆！”

水鼠兰特慌了，忙去拉他的胳膊肘，但已经太晚了。托德已经膨胀起身子，吹起牛来。

“聪明？哦，不！”他说，“按照朋友们的看法，我其实并不聪明。我只是从英国最牢固的监狱里逃脱了，仅此而已！俘获了一列火车，乘着它逃亡，仅此而已！乔装打扮，在乡间到处跑，骗过了每一个人，仅此而已！哦，不！我是一头笨驴，是的！莫尔，我给你讲一两回我的小小冒险，然后你自己去判断吧！”

“嗯，好的，”鼹鼠莫尔说，向餐桌走过去，“我一边吃，你一边讲。从吃早饭到现在，我还一口东西没吃过呢！哦，天！哦，天！”他坐下来，大吃冷牛肉和酸黄瓜。

托德叉开腿站在炉前地毯上，把爪子猛插到裤兜里，掏出一把银币。“瞧这个！”他嚷道，“几分钟就搞到手了，不坏吧？你猜我是怎么搞到的，莫尔？马匹交易！我卖马换来的！”

“接着说，托德。”鼹鼠莫尔说，兴趣浓得要命。

“托德，拜托你安静些！”水鼠兰特说，“你别再怂恿他了，莫尔，你不是不了解他这人。既然托德终于回来了，还是尽快告诉我们情形如何，最好怎么办。”

“情形坏得不能再坏了，”鼹鼠莫尔气呼呼地答道，“至于说怎么办，嗨，我要知道就谢天谢地了！獾子班杰和我白天晚上在周围转悠，情形一直没什么两样。到处有哨兵站岗，枪口指着我们，石头向我们砸过来。瞭望台上始终有动物值班，一看见我们，天！笑成那个样子！最让我恼火的就是他们的笑！”

“情形确实很困难，”水鼠兰特深思着说道，“不过，我想，我心底里已经知道了，知道托德其实应该怎么干。听我说。他应该……”

“不，不该！”鼹鼠莫尔大叫，嘴里包得满满的，“不能做那种事！你不明白。他应该做的是，他应该……”

“哟，我可不干，反正不干！”托德嚷道，激动起来，“我不想被你们这些家伙支使来支使去！现在说的是我的宅子，怎么干才好我知道，我来告诉你们，我要……”

这时他们三个一齐扯直了嗓门说话，吵闹得震耳欲聋，却有一个细弱、冷冰冰的声音，大家都听见了：“马上全都给我安静下来！”霎时间，鸦雀无声。

是獾子班杰发话了，他已经吃完馅饼，在椅子里转过身来，严厉地看着他们。看到他们的注意力已经被抓牢，明显在等他开讲，他又回过身去对着桌子，伸手拿干酪。这只令人钦佩的动物，他的可以信赖的人品受到了超乎寻常的敬重。直到他用餐完毕，掸掉膝头上的碎屑，没有一个人再说出一个字。癞蛤蟆托德坐立不安，但水鼠兰特牢牢地摁住了他。

獾子班杰吃饱喝足了，从座位上起来，站在壁炉前沉思着。终于，他开口说话了。

“托德！”他严厉地说道，“你这个烦人的小坏动物！你不为自己害臊吗？如果你父亲，我的老朋友，今晚在这里，知道了你的所作所为，你觉得他会怎么说？”

托德原本高翘着腿坐在沙发上，一下子就侧翻过去脸贴着沙发，痛悔地抽泣起来，哭得浑身打颤。

“好啦，好啦！”獾子班杰语气温和了些，继续往下说，“没关系。别哭啦。过去的事就让它过去，我们来掀开新的一页吧。不过，鼹鼠莫尔说的全是实情。每个要紧地点都有白鼬站岗，他们形成了世上最好的哨兵阵。正面攻击是完全不会有效果的。我们寡不敌众。”

“那就全完了，”癞蛤蟆托德呜咽道，哭着哭着把脸埋在了沙发垫子里，“我要去报名当兵，永远不再见我亲爱的蛤蟆府！”

“得啦，振作起来，蛤蟆仔！”獾子班杰说，“要收复一个地方，除了强攻以外，还有别的办法呀。我话还没说完呢。现在我要告诉你们一个大秘密。”

托德慢慢地坐起来，擦干眼泪。秘密对他的吸引力是极其巨大的，因为他从来守不住秘密。每次信誓旦旦地保证不泄露秘密之后，他都会跑去告诉别的动物，从中体验到一种很罪孽的刺激和快感，他喜欢这种享受。

“有——条——地——下——通——道，”獾子班杰一字一顿地强调说，“从离这里很近的河岸，直通到蛤蟆府中央。”

“哦，胡扯！班杰，”托德相当轻率地说，“你是听附近酒馆里那帮人胡编的天方夜谭吧。蛤蟆府里里外外，每一英寸，我都了如指掌。根本没什么地道的，我向你保证！”

“我的年轻朋友，”獾子班杰极其严肃地说，“你父亲，那是一个值得尊敬的人，比我认识的一些人可敬得多。他是我的至交，曾经告诉过我许多他不敢让你知道的事。他发现了那条地道，当然，不是他挖的。他搬到那里住之前就有，几百年前挖出来的。他把它修好，打扫清理了一番，因为他觉得，也许有一天，万一遇到麻烦或危险，它会派上用场。他带我去看了。‘别让我儿子知道这事，’他说，‘他是个好孩子，但性格很轻佻，没定性，简直管不住自己的舌头。哪一天他真的处在困境中，用得上它时，你可以让他知道这条秘密地道，但事先别告诉他。”

另外两只动物紧盯着托德，看他作何反应。一开始，托德绷着面孔好像要生气了，但他脸上立刻就露出了喜色。他一向就是个心地善良的家伙。

“好吧，好吧，”他说，“也许，我是有点多嘴多舌。像我这样一个公众人物，老是有朋友围着，一起逗逗乐子，露露才华，讲些风趣的故事，不知怎么地我的舌头就要东拉西扯了。我口才好。曾经有人说我应该办个沙龙，无论那是个什么东东。不管它了。接着说，班杰。你这条地道能帮上我们什么忙呢？”

“最近我发现了一两个情况，”獾子班杰接着说道，“我让奥特装扮成扫烟囱的，扛着刷子去后门口叫门，讨活儿干。他探听到明天晚上要大办宴席。有人过生日──我估摸着是黄鼠狼头领，所有的黄鼠狼都会聚集在宴会厅里，大吃大喝，大笑大闹，什么都不会怀疑。不带枪不带剑不带棍棒，什么武器都不带！”

“可是还会像平时一样，有哨兵站岗的呀。”水鼠兰特评论道。

“正是这样，”獾子班杰说，“我想说的要点就在这里。黄鼠狼们会完全信赖他们的优秀哨兵。地道的用场就在这里。那条非常有用的通道直通到备膳室下面，就在宴会厅隔壁！”

“啊哈！备膳室里那块嘎吱嘎吱响的地板！”托德说，“现在我明白了！”

“我们悄悄地从地道里爬出来，溜进备膳室……”鼹鼠莫尔嚷嚷。

“带着手枪、刀剑和棍棒……”水鼠兰特大叫。

“冲进去，扑向他们。”獾子班杰说。

“狠揍他们，狠揍他们，狠揍他们！”癞蛤蟆托德欣喜若狂地喊叫着，在房间里跳过一张张椅子，绕圈跑。

“那好，”獾子班杰说，态度又像平时那样冷冰冰的，“计划已经定下来，你们没有什么可争吵的了。时间已经很晚，都立刻去上床睡觉吧。明天早晨，我们再安排一切必要的准备工作。”

托德当然跟其他人一起，乖乖地去睡觉了。他虽然觉得兴奋，睡不着，却也知道，犟着不肯睡是行不通的。他经历了漫长的一天，很多事情挤在一起发生。前些天又只有稻草当铺盖，稻草还不多，就那么铺在石板地上，而且牢房还透风。所以，现在，床单和毯子真是让人感到亲切和舒适呀。他把脑袋搁到枕头上没几秒钟，就幸福地打起了呼噜。自然，他做了好多梦，梦见他正需要道路时，道路就溜走了；梦见水渠在后面追他，把他抓住；梦见自己正开宴会，一条驳船驶进宴会厅，送来了要他这个礼拜洗好的衣服；梦见自己在一条秘密通道里，正慢慢向前走，它却扭动着转过身来，抖抖身子，坐直了……不知怎么回事，最后他一下子发现自己得胜还朝，平安无事地回到了蛤蟆府，所有的朋友都围着他，很认真地向他保证说，他确实是一只聪明的癞蛤蟆。

第二天早晨，他睡到很晚才起床。下楼后，他发现别的动物都已经吃过早饭好一会儿了。鼹鼠莫尔自个儿溜了出去，没告诉任何人他去哪里。獾子班杰坐在扶手椅里，正在看报纸，对那一天晚上就要发生的事，丝毫也不关心。另一方面呢，水鼠兰特却在屋子里跑来跑去地忙，怀里抱着各式各样的武器，倒在地板上把它们分成四小堆。他一边跑，一边压低嗓门兴奋地念叨着：“这把——剑——给——兰特，这把——剑——给——莫尔，这把——剑——给——托德，这把——剑——给——班杰！这支——手枪——给——兰特，这支——手枪——给——莫尔，这支——手枪——给——托德，这支——手枪——给——班杰！”等等等等，他这样有规律、有节奏地念叨着，那四个小堆就渐渐地越长越高了。

“活儿干得挺不错，兰特，”獾子班杰的目光从报纸边缘瞥过来，看着那忙个不停的小动物，他就说，“我不是在责怪你，可一旦避过白鼬和他们那些可恶的枪，我们就用不着刀剑和手枪了，这个我可以向你保证。我们四个，带上棍棒，一旦进入宴会厅，呃，五分钟就可以把那帮家伙全部清除。本来整件事我一个人就可以解决的，只是不想剥夺你们这些家伙的乐趣而已！”

“还是保险一点的好。”水鼠兰特一边沉思着说，一边用袖子擦一支手枪的枪管，并用眼睛瞄着它。

癞蛤蟆托德吃完了早饭，抄起一根粗棍子，使劲儿挥舞着，痛打想象中的坏动物。“抢我的宅子，我要领教他们！”他叫喊着，“我要领教他们，我要领教他们！”

“别说‘领教他们’，托德，”水鼠兰特说，惊愕得要命，“这样说英语不恰当。”

“你干吗老挑剔托德？”獾子班杰有些生气地责问道，“他的英语怎么啦？我自己也这样说，如果我听着觉得没什么不好，那你听着也该没什么不好！”

“对不起，”水鼠兰特温顺地说，“我只是觉得应该说‘教训他们’，而不是‘领教他们。’”

“可我们不想教训他们，”獾子班杰回敬道，“我们想领教他们，领教他们！而且，我们就要去领教了！”

“哦，那好吧，你们想怎样说就怎样说吧。”水鼠兰特说。他自己也有几分糊涂起来，就退缩到一个角落里。只听见他在那边一个劲儿地咕哝着：“领教他们，教训他们；教训他们，领教他们！”最后獾子班杰厉声喝叫，他才停止。

不久，鼹鼠莫尔就跌跌撞撞地进屋来了，他显然很得意。“真带劲儿！”他迫不及待地说，“我耍弄那些白鼬，把他们惹急了！”

“你没有闯祸吧，莫尔？”水鼠兰特着急地说。

“我也希望没有，”鼹鼠莫尔自信地说，“我是在厨房里想到这个主意的。我去厨房，是想确保托德的早餐在炉子上焐着，他起来时有热乎的吃。我发现，他昨天穿回家的那套洗衣妇的旧衣服就挂在炉子前面的毛巾架上。我就穿上了，又戴上那顶女帽，披上披肩，出发去蛤蟆府，要多勇敢有多勇敢。当然啰，有哨兵端着枪站在瞭望台上，问我‘来的是什么人？’还把他们那一套废话，全说了一遍。‘早上好，先生们！’我恭恭敬敬地说，‘今天有衣服要洗吗？’

“他们非常傲慢非常生硬地看着我，说道：‘滚开，洗衣妇！我们在值班，不洗衣服。’‘要不改天再洗？’我说。嚯，嚯，嚯！我搞笑不搞笑，托德？”

“这么轻浮，真是个可怜的动物！”托德很高傲地说。其实呢，对莫尔的作为，他妒忌得要命。他真希望干那事的是他本人。要是他先想到这主意，而且没有睡过头，那该多好呀。

“有几只白鼬涨红了脸，”鼹鼠莫尔接着说道，“那个小队长，他对我说，他非常暴躁地说：‘快滚蛋，我的个好大姐，滚蛋！别招惹我的兵值班时闲聊。’‘滚蛋？’我说，‘快要滚蛋的人不是我，用不了多久的！’”

“鼹仔啊，你怎么能那么干？”水鼠兰特非常惊慌地说。

獾子班杰放下了报纸。

“我看见他们竖起了耳朵，面面相觑，”鼹鼠莫尔接着说道，“小队长对他们说：‘别把她的话当真，她不知道自己在说什么。’

“‘是吗！我不知道？’我说，‘好啊，那我就给你们说说。我女儿是给班杰洗衣服的，你们自己想吧，我到底知道不知道自己在说什么。你们也很快就会知道我在说什么了！今天晚上，一百只杀气腾腾的獾子会端着来复枪，从养马场那边进攻蛤蟆府；六船水鼠，会挎着手枪和短剑，从大河上过来，在花园前面登岸；同时一队挑选出来的癞蛤蟆，号称“癞蛤蟆敢死队”，“不成功便成仁”，会呐喊着报仇，对果园发动突击，所过之处，鸡犬不留。遇上他们的话，你们就没多少衣服好洗喽，除非你们趁着还有机会，赶快开溜！’说完我就跑开了。一离开他们的视线，我就躲起来，然后沿着地沟爬回去，透过树篱偷看他们。那些白鼬全都紧张极了，慌乱极了，立刻四散奔逃，互相碰撞，摔倒在对方身上。他们个个向别人发号施令，个个不听号令。小队长不停地派一批批白鼬去前沿，接着又派别的家伙把他们叫回来。我听到他们互相之间在议论：‘黄鼠狼就是这德行，他们舒舒服服待在宴会厅里，大吃大喝，碰杯唱歌，寻欢作乐，却要我们站岗。这里又冷又黑，到头来，我们还不是让杀人不眨眼的獾子切成碎片！’”

“哦，你个蠢驴，莫尔！”托德嚷道，“你把一切都搞砸了！”

“莫尔，”獾子班杰用他那冷冰冰的平静态度说道，“我觉得，你一个小指头里的见识比某些动物整个胖身体里的还要多。你干得好极了，我对你寄予厚望。好莫尔！聪明的莫尔！”

癞蛤蟆托德简直嫉妒得发了狂，尤其是，他赌上性命也弄不明白，鼹鼠莫尔怎么就特别聪明了。不过，幸好他还没来得及冲着獾子班杰的讥讽言语发脾气午饭铃就已经响起来了。否则的话，他可要丢人现眼了。

这顿饭简单但是营养充足──熏肉和蚕豆，还有通心粉布丁。大家吃完后，獾子班杰在扶手椅里坐下来，说道：“嗯，我们今晚的活儿已经安排好了，可能要干到很晚才能全部完成。所以我要趁着还有时间，打四十个盹。”他拉过一块手绢盖在脸上，很快就打起呼噜来。

心急而勤劳的兰特又立刻开始做准备工作。他在他的四小堆装备之间跑来跑去，嘴里念叨着：“这根——皮带——给——兰特，这根——皮带——给——莫尔，这根——皮带——给——托德，这根——皮带——给——班杰！”等等等等，不断地添上新装备，好像没完没了似的。于是，鼹鼠莫尔挽着托德的胳膊，把他领到屋外，推进一张藤椅里，要他把冒险经历从头到尾讲一遍。托德那是求之不得，一百个愿意呀。鼹鼠莫尔是个好听众，这回又没有人推敲核实、提出不友好的批评，托德就随心所欲胡侃起来。说实在的，他的许多叙述归到“要是我及时想到，而不是十分钟以后想到，事情可能就会是这样”一类里会更加合适。冒险故事永远是最精彩最刺激的，为什么就不能把它当成我们的真实经历呢，就像现实生活中发生的那些有点不够味的事情一样？

[1]在中文里，雪貂（ferret）和白鼬（stoat）常被用来称呼同一种动物。事实上，ferret是欧洲臭鼬家养驯化的后代，棕黄毛色；stoat则是白色的。它们和黄鼬（黄鼠狼，weasel）同类不同种。





第十二章　尤利西斯归来[1]


天开始黑的时候，水鼠兰特带着兴奋而诡秘的神气召集大家回到客厅里。他让伙伴们各自站在一小堆装备跟前，为即将进行的征战着手武装他们。这件事他做得很认真、很周全，整个过程花了很长时间。首先，给每一只动物腰里系上皮带，然后在皮带上插一支剑；为了保持平衡，又在另一侧插上一把弯刀。然后佩上两支手枪，一根警棍，几副手铐，一些绷带和胶布，一瓶水和一盒三明治。獾子班杰和蔼可亲地笑着说道：“行啊，鼠仔！这样子你高兴，我又没损失。我就用这根棍子，把我该干的活儿都干了。”可水鼠兰特只是说：“行行好，班杰。你知道，我不想你事后责备我，说我忘带东西！”

一切准备就绪。獾子班杰一只爪子提着一盏没点亮的灯笼，另一只爪子握着一根棍子，说道：“行啦，跟着我！莫尔排第一，因为我对他很满意，兰特第二，托德最后。听着，蛤蟆仔！别像平常那样唠叨许多废话，否则就把你打发回去，绝不含糊！”

癞蛤蟆托德很担心被留下，只好一声也不吭，接受了指派给他的低等位置。动物们出发了。獾子班杰领着他们沿着大河走了一小段，然后，突然攀住岸沿，身子一荡，进了稍微高出水面的一个洞。鼹鼠莫尔和水鼠兰特学着獾子班杰的样子，不声不响，一个接一个，成功地荡了进去。轮到托德了，不出所料，他居然脚下一滑，噗通一下掉进水里，发出一声惊慌的尖叫。两个朋友把他拉上来，连忙把他上上下下擦了一遍，拧干他的衣服，安慰他几句，扶他站了起来。可獾子班杰真的生气了，他对托德说，如果下一回他再出丑，没二话，肯定把他丢下。

他们终于进了那条秘密地道，驱逐入侵者的征战正式开始了！

地道很冷、很黑、很湿、很矮、很窄，可怜的托德开始打哆嗦，一是因为害怕，不知道前面会碰到什么，二是因为他浑身都是湿的。灯笼在前面很远的地方。在黑暗中，他没办法，落下了一小段路。这时，他听见水鼠兰特向他发出警告：“快跟上，托德！”一阵恐怖感袭上心头，他害怕被丢在后面独自待在黑暗里，就猛地往前冲去。他一下子撞倒了兰特，兰特又撞倒了莫尔，莫尔又撞倒了班杰，顿时一片混乱。獾子班杰以为他们背后遭到了袭击，因为空间狭小，没法用棍子或弯刀，他就拔出了手枪。眼看就要冲着托德扣动板机时，他弄明白了真相，火气一下子真的上来了，他说：“这一回，必须把讨厌的托德丢下！”

可是托德呜呜地哭了起来，另外两只动物就出来担保，说保证让他好好表现，最后獾子班杰息怒了。队伍继续前进，不过这一回是水鼠兰特殿后，而且他牢牢地抓着托德的肩膀。

就这样，他们摸索着一步一步往前走，耳朵支着，爪子按着手枪。走啊走，终于，獾子班杰发话了：“现在，我们应该已经快到蛤蟆府下面了。”

这时，他们突然听见一片低沉的、乱哄哄的声音。那声音其实有可能还离得很远，却好像就在他们头顶上很近的地方似的。仿佛是有人在喊叫、欢呼、跺地板、捶桌子。癞蛤蟆托德再一次陷入神经质的恐惧之中，但獾子班杰只是平静地评论了一句：“是那些黄鼠狼，他们在闹！”

现在地道开始向上倾斜了，他们又向前摸索着走了一小段路，然后那噪音一下子又响了起来，这一回十分清晰，就在他们上面很近的地方。“万——岁——万岁——万——岁——万岁！”只听见哇啦哇啦在叫，小脚爪在跺地板，小拳头捶在桌子上时玻璃杯在叮叮当当响。“他们过得可真快活！”獾子班杰说，“快跟上！”他们就快步往前走去。然后，地道一下子就到了头，他们发现自己站在活板门下面，它通往上面的备膳室。

宴会厅里吵翻了天，几乎不存在被他们听到动静的危险。獾子班杰说：“现在，小伙子们，一起使劲儿！”四只动物用肩膀顶住活板门，把它掀了开来。他们一个拽一个，到了上面，发现自己站在备膳室里，跟宴会厅之间只隔着一道门，蒙在鼓里的敌人正在隔壁狂饮胡闹呢。

他们刚从地道里爬上来时，那吵闹声简直震耳欲聋。这会儿，欢呼声和捶桌子的声音终于渐渐减弱了，一个分辨得出来的声音在说话：“嗯，我不打算耽误你们很长时间，”（一阵极其热烈的鼓掌声）“但是在我重新坐下去之前，”（又是一阵欢呼）“我想说一句话，谈谈我们仁慈的主人托德先生。我们都认识托德！”（一阵哄堂大笑）“善良的托德，谦虚的托德，诚实的托德！”（一阵阵兴高采烈的尖叫声）

“别让我抓住他！”托德咬牙切齿地低声说。

“忍耐一分钟！”獾子班杰说，好不容易摁住了他，“大家准备好！”

“我来给你们唱一支小曲儿，”那声音接着说道，“这是我以托德为题编出来的。”（经久不息的掌声）

于是，黄鼠狼头领──那声音正是他──用又高又尖的声音开始唱：





托德他高高兴兴

喜洋洋走在大街上……





獾子班杰挺直身子，两只爪子握紧棍子，扫了一眼同伴，喊道：

“时候到了，跟我上！”

猛一下推开了门。

天！

吱吱吱、唧唧唧、哇呀呀，满屋子的尖叫声响成一片！

四位英雄怒气冲冲大踏步冲进宴会厅的恐怖一刻，那一阵恐慌呀，好家伙，吓坏了的黄鼠狼有的一头钻到桌子底下，有的发疯似的跳上了窗台！好家伙，雪貂们狂乱地奔向壁炉，无可救药地挤在一起，卡在了烟囱里！好家伙，桌子椅子被撞倒了，玻璃杯和瓷器被碰翻了，在地板上摔得粉碎！那大力士班杰，胡须根根直立起来，大棍子带着啸声从空中划过。莫尔黑着脸，凶巴巴挥舞着棍棒，恶狠狠发着战斗的呐喊：“鼹鼠来了！鼹鼠来了！”兰特腰带上鼓鼓囊囊插满了各个年代各种式样的兵器，不顾一切不要命地冲杀着。托德因为自尊心受了伤害，激动得发了狂，身体鼓胀得比平时大一倍，跳到空中，发出癞蛤蟆那种哇哇的怪叫，吓得他们毛骨悚然！“托德他高高兴兴！”他叫喊着，“我让你们高兴！”直奔黄鼠狼头领而去。他们总共只有四个，但在那些惊惶失措的黄鼠狼眼里，宴会厅里仿佛全是妖怪似的动物，灰的、黑的、棕色的、黄色的，哇哇地怪叫着，挥舞着巨大的棍棒。他们惊恐地尖叫着，向四面八方夺路而逃，跳出窗户，窜上烟囱，有地方去就行，只要能躲开那些可怕的棍子。

这件大事很快就结束了。四个朋友在整个宴会厅里大踏步来回巡视着，只要有一个脑袋露出来，就给它一棍子。五分钟后，厅里面就已经清除干净。那些吓坏了的黄鼠狼逃过草坪时发出的尖叫声，透过破碎的窗户，隐隐约约地传到他们耳朵里。地板上倒着几十个敌人，鼹鼠莫尔正忙着给他们戴手铐。獾子班杰辛苦了一场，正靠在他的大棍子上休息，擦去他那正直的额头上的汗水。

“莫尔，”他说，“你是最棒的伙伴！跑快点，去外面瞧一眼你打过交道的那些白鼬哨兵，看看他们在干什么。我看啊，今天晚上，他们不用我们再怎么劳神费心了！”

鼹鼠莫尔立刻跳出窗户，不见了人影。班杰吩咐另外两位扶起一张桌子，从地板上的碎片中捡出一些刀叉杯盘来，看看能不能找出些材料，凑齐一顿晚饭。“我想吃点东西，真的，”他用平时那种平平常常的口吻说道，“动作快些，托德，拿出点活泼的样子来！我们给你夺回了房子，你却连三明治都不拿一个出来。”托德觉得挺伤心：獾子班杰表扬了莫尔，却没有对他说些好听的，没有夸他是一个优秀的伙伴，打仗时表现出色。他自己对自己可是相当满意，特别是扑向黄鼠狼头领那一幕，一棍子就把他打飞到桌子的另一边。伤心归伤心，他还是四下里忙碌起来，水鼠兰特也一起帮忙。他们很快就找到了一玻璃盘番石榴果酱、一只冷鸡、一根几乎没动过的口条、一些屈莱弗甜食[2]，还有许多龙虾沙拉。在备膳室里，他们发现了一篮子法式面包卷，还有要多少有多少的干酪、黄油和芹菜。他们正要坐下，却看见鼹鼠莫尔从窗户里爬进来，抱着一堆来复枪，咯咯地笑着。

“我估摸着呀，”他报告说，“已经全结束了。那些白鼬本来就神经紧张、心惊肉跳的，有的一听见宴会厅里的尖叫、呐喊和吵闹声就扔下来复枪逃了。另外一些坚守了一会儿，可一看见黄鼠狼从房里逃出去奔向他们，就觉得自己被出卖了。白鼬就揪住黄鼠狼不放，黄鼠狼就挣扎着想脱身，他们扭打成一团，互相用拳头狠揍，在地上翻过来滚过去，最后那些家伙大多数滚下了河！不管是怎样跑的，反正现在他们全都没了踪影。我就把他们的来复枪弄来了。所以呀，万事大吉喽！”

“你表现很出色，立了大功！”獾子班杰说，嘴里包着鸡肉和屈莱弗甜食，“现在，你再替我做一件事就行了，莫尔，然后，你就坐下来，同我们一起吃晚饭。我本不想麻烦你的，只是我知道，事情交给你肯定能办好，能让人放心。要是我能对我认识的每一个人都这样说，那该多好哟。假如兰特不是个诗人，这件事我就叫他去办了。我要你去那边，把地板上那帮家伙带上楼，让他们打扫出几间卧室来，整理好，布置得舒舒服服。叫他们务必把床底下扫干净，换上干净床单和枕套，把被子掀开一只角，该掀成什么样你知道的。还要给每个房间备上干净毛巾、新开包的肥皂、一壶热水。然后，要是揍他们能让你高兴的话，就给他们每人一顿拳脚，让他们从后门滚蛋。我看呐，从此以后我们再也不会看见他们了。办完事你就过来，尝尝这种冷口条，上等的好东西哟。我对你很满意，莫尔！”

好脾气的莫尔捡起一根棍子，指挥犯人在地板上排成一行，命令他们“齐步走！”就带着一队人马上楼去了。过了一段时间，他走下楼来，笑呵呵地，说每个房间都打扫布置好了，像一根新别针一样干净。“还有，我没揍他们，”他补充道，“我想呀，总的说来，他们一个晚上挨那么多揍已经够了。我把这个想法对黄鼠狼说了，他们十分赞成，说今后再也不想麻烦我动手了。他们的悔罪态度很好，还说他们对自己的所作所为后悔至极，不过全是黄鼠狼头领和白鼬们的错。今后任何时候，只要我们言语一声，他们愿意赴汤蹈火，将功补过。所以我发给他们每人一个面包卷，放他们从后门出去，他们撒开腿就溜哇，能跑多快就跑多快！”

鼹鼠莫尔说完，把椅子拉近桌子坐下，拿起那根冷口条，埋头大吃起来。托德毕竟是个绅士，他把满心的嫉妒丢开，诚心诚意地说：“衷心感谢你，莫尔，谢谢你今晚费心费力，尤其谢谢你今天早晨的聪明机智！”獾子班杰听了很高兴，说道：“说这话的才是勇敢的托德！”他们欢天喜地、扬眉吐气地吃完晚饭就钻进干净的被窝里休息了。他们安安稳稳地就寝在托德的祖宅里，这是靠无比的勇气、完美的韬略和恰如其分的武力夺回来的。

第二天早晨，托德像往常一样睡过了头，下楼来吃早饭时已经晚得不像话了。他发现桌子上只剩下一些蛋壳，几片冷透了已经变韧的烤面包，一只空了四分之三的咖啡壶，别的几乎就没有了。这下子，他的心情好不起来啰，想想看，这毕竟是他自己的家呀。透过早餐室的法式窗户，他看见鼹鼠莫尔和水鼠兰特坐在草坪上的藤椅里，显然正在互相讲故事给对方听。他们把两双短腿朝天乱踢乱蹬，笑得好疯哦。獾子班杰坐在扶手椅里，正埋头看晨报。托德走进房间时，他只抬起眼睛看了他一眼，点了下头。不过托德知道班杰就是那么样一个人，只好坐下来，尽量凑合着吃一顿早饭。他只在心里面对自己说，迟早有一天，要跟这几个家伙算账。他快吃完的时候，獾子班杰抬起头来，简明扼要地说：“对不起，托德，恐怕今天上午有好多事摆在你面前呢。你瞧，我们实在应该马上举办一个宴会，庆祝这件大事。这要你来操持了，规矩就是如此。”

“噢，没问题！”癞蛤蟆托德心里很乐意，说，“一切遵命。可我不明白，干吗一定要在上午举办宴会。不过呢，你知道，亲爱的老班杰，我活着不是为了自己开心，只是为了探询朋友们的需要，然后设法予以满足！”

“别在这里装傻，”獾子班杰脾气很大地回敬道，“不要一边说话，一边吱溜吱溜地喝咖啡，这不礼貌。我的意思是，宴会当然在晚上举行，但邀请函得马上就写好发出去，得你来写。坐到那张桌子跟前去，那边有一叠空白邀请函，抬头是蓝底子烫金的“蛤蟆府”。给我们的所有朋友每人写一张，如果你抓紧时间，午饭之前就可以发出去。我会搭一把手，分担一些任务。酒席由我来预订。”

“什么！”托德沮丧地嚷道，“这么愉快的早晨，让我待在屋里写一大堆烂邀请函？我想到这园子里四处走走，把各种人和事恢复正常，神气神气，快活快活！我才不干呢！我要去……我要看着你们……不过，停一分钟！嗯，我当然会干，亲爱的班杰！我自己的快乐和方便，跟别人的相比算得了什么！你要我干，我就去干。去吧，班杰，去预订酒席吧，你喜欢什么样的就订什么样的。然后就到外面去，同那两个年轻朋友一起无忧无虑地欢笑，不用管我，不用留意我怎样操心劳神、辛苦工作。为了神圣的责任和友谊，我愿意牺牲这个美好的早晨！”

獾子班杰疑心很重地看着他，可是托德神情坦然自若，很难想象这种态度转变的背后，能有什么不光彩的动机。于是，他离开早餐室，向厨房方向走去。门刚在班杰身后关上，托德就急不可待地奔向写字台。刚才和班杰说话时，他突然想到了一个好主意。他愿意写邀请函了，他要记着在每一封邀请函里提到自己在战斗中的主导作用，提到他怎样把黄鼠狼头领撂倒。他要在里面暗示自己的冒险生涯，暗示那是一段不得不讲一讲的充满凯歌的经历。在邀请函的扉页上，他要列出一个晚会表演节目单之类的东西──诸如此类吧，他脑子里是这样筹划的：





演讲

演讲者：托德

（晚会期间托德还要发表其他演讲）





致词

发言人：托德

大纲：我们的监狱体制──老英格兰的航道──马匹处理及处理方法──财产、产权和义务──回归故土──典型英国乡绅。





唱歌

演唱者：托德（本人创作的歌曲）





其他作品

作曲：托德

晚会期间由作曲者演唱。





这个主意让他心里美滋滋的，他便很努力地动手干起活儿来。中午，所有邀请函都写好了。这段时间里他得到禀报，门口来了一只衣衫褴褛的小个子黄鼠狼，怯生生地询问能否为老爷们效劳。托德昂首阔步来到外面，发现原来是昨晚被俘的黄鼠狼之一，这会儿恭敬而热切地来拍马屁了。托德拍拍他的脑袋，把一扎邀请函塞进他的爪子，叫他路上赶紧些，尽快把它们分送出去。如果他晚上愿意再过来，也许会给他一个先令，不过也可能不给。可怜的黄鼠狼好像真的十分感恩戴德，急切匆忙地去执行任务了。

另位三只动物在河上玩了一个上午，热热闹闹、轻松愉快地回来吃午饭了。鼹鼠莫尔本来一直觉得良心不安，就疑神疑鬼地看着托德，估摸着他要么在生闷气，要么垂头丧气。才不是呢，托德可是打足了气，神气活现。鼹鼠莫尔心里犯起了嘀咕，水鼠兰特和獾子班杰则意味深长地交换了一个眼色。

午饭刚吃完，托德就把两只爪子深深地插进裤兜，随意地说了一句：“嗨，照顾好自己，你们这些家伙！一切自便！”就大摇大摆地向花园走去，他想在那里琢磨一下晚上演讲的事，这时水鼠兰特抓住了他的胳膊。

托德疑心他接下来要干什么，使足劲儿想挣脱。可是当獾子班杰牢牢地捉住他另一只胳膊时，他开始明白过来：游戏结束了。两只动物把他夹在中间，带着他进了与大堂相通的小吸烟室，关上门，把他摁进椅子里。他们俩堵在他面前，托德一声不吭地坐着，疑神疑鬼、情绪恶劣地望着他们。

“现在听好了，托德，”水鼠兰特说，“是这次宴会的事。对不起，我不得不这样对你说话。我们希望一劳永逸地让你明白，宴会上不会有演讲，不会有唱歌。你要搞清楚，这一回我们不是在同你讨论，只是通知你一声。”

托德看懂了：他掉进了圈套。他们了解他，他们看透了他，他们抢在了前面。他的美梦粉碎了。

“我就唱一支短歌，行不行？”他惨兮兮地央求道。

“不行，一支也不行，”水鼠兰特很坚决地说，虽说他注意到可怜的托德很失望地颤抖着嘴唇，也挺心疼的，“那没有好处，蛤蟆仔。你清楚得很，你那些歌全都是自高自大，自吹自擂。你的演讲全是自赞自夸，和……和……嗯，令人恶心的夸张，和……和……”

“和吹牛。”獾子班杰用他那种平淡的口吻插言道。

“这是为你自己好，蛤蟆仔，”水鼠兰特接着说，“你知道，你迟早要翻开新的一页。现在似乎正是重新开始的大好时机，是你人生的转折点。你要知道，说这些话时我心里面一点也不比你好受。”

托德沉默着，埋头想了好久。最后他抬起头来，脸上带着经历过强烈情感冲动的痕迹。“你们胜利了，我的朋友们，”他语不成声地说，“其实，我提出来的只是一个小小的要求，只求允许我再灿烂、盛开一个晚上，让我尽情表现一下，听听喧腾的欢呼声。不知为什么，我觉得那声音似乎总是能显现出我最好的品质。但我知道，你们是对的，我错了。从今天起，我要重新做人。我的朋友们，你们再也不会有机会为我脸红了。天哪，天哪，这世界真冷酷！”

他用手绢捂住脸，脚步蹒跚地离开了吸烟室。

“班杰，”水鼠兰特说道，“我觉得自己像一头没人性的野兽，不知道你感觉怎样？”

“啊，我明白，我明白，”獾子班杰忧郁地说，“但事情非这么办不可。这位仁兄得在这里生活下去，守住自己的家业，得到别人的尊敬。总不能让他成为大家的笑柄，让白鼬和黄鼠狼嘲讽讥笑吧？”

“那当然，”水鼠兰特说，“提到黄鼠狼，那只小黄鼠狼带着托德的邀请函正要出发，碰巧让我们遇上了，真是万幸。我想到你对我说过的话，起了疑心，就看了一两封，简直是太丢人了。被我一股脑儿全没收了。现在，好莫尔正坐在那间天蓝色的起居室里，填写简单朴素的请柬。”

举行宴会的时间终于临近了。托德一直避开众人，躲在自己的卧室里，现在仍然孤独地坐在那里，想着心事。他用爪子撑住额头，长久地深思着。渐渐地，他的面容开朗起来，慢慢地、长时间地展露着笑颜。然后他咯咯地笑了起来，笑得有点害羞、有点忸怩。最后他站起身，锁上门，拉上窗帘，把房间里所有的椅子拉过来，排成一个半圆形，自己站在前面，身子很明显地鼓胀着。然后他鞠一躬，咳嗽两声，对着他在想象中清清楚楚看到的欣喜若狂的观众，放开嗓门，尽情地唱了起来：





托德的最后一支短歌！





癞蛤蟆托德——回转——家门！

客厅里恐慌一片，

大堂里嗥叫连连；

牛棚里鬼哭狼嚎，

马厩里叫声贼尖，

当癞蛤蟆托德——回转——家门！





当癞蛤蟆托德——回转——家门！

有动物破窗而入，

有动物砸门而入；

黄鼠狼四处逃窜，

晕倒在地板上面，

当癞蛤蟆托德——回转——家门！





嘭！鼓儿声声！

喇叭手把喇叭吹起，

士兵们举手敬礼，

炮手们鸣放礼炮，

汽车鸣响了汽笛，

当英雄——回转——家门！





喊叫吧——万岁——万岁！

让人群中每一个人

都这样高声喊叫；

向一只动物表示敬意，

他正是你们的骄傲，

因为托德的大日子——正是——今朝！





他大声地唱着，唱得津津有味，绘声绘色；唱完一遍，又从头再唱了一遍。

然后他发出一声叹息，一声很长很长很长的叹息。

然后，他拿发刷在水罐里浸湿，把头发从中间分开，刷平伏，让它们整齐光滑地贴在两边的脸颊上。他打开门，平平静静地下楼去接见客人们，他知道，他们一定已经聚集在客厅里了。

他进去的时候，所有动物欢呼致意，围拢来祝贺他，称赞他勇敢、聪明，打仗好本事。但托德只是淡淡一笑，低声说一句：“哪里的话！”有时换个说法：“正相反呢！”水獭奥特这时站在壁炉前的地毯上，正向一圈怀着羡慕之情的朋友描述如果在场他会怎么干。看见托德，他大叫一声走上前来，搂住他的脖子，要拉他在客厅里凯旋式地绕场一周。托德却委婉地拒绝了他，一边脱开身子，一边温和地说：“做决策的是班杰，冲锋陷阵的主力是莫尔和兰特，我只是充当了一个普通的士兵，做得很少，也可以说没做什么。”他这种出人意料的态度，显然把动物们弄糊涂了，让他们傻了眼。托德感觉到，当他从一个个客人面前走过，谦虚地答谢他们时，他吸引了每一只动物的兴趣。

獾子班杰把一切安排得尽善尽美，宴会获得了巨大的成功。动物们有说有笑，逗闷子打趣，但是，理所当然坐在主位上的托德，自始至终眼睛看着鼻子尖，只对左右两侧的动物低声说几句令人愉快的闲话。他不时偷偷地瞄一眼獾子班杰和水鼠兰特。每次他望过去时，他们俩总是张大嘴巴，互相对视着。这给了托德极大的满足。晚会进行了一段时间，一些比较年轻活泼的动物耐不住了，交头接耳议论说，过去的好日子里宴会都很好玩，这一回不行了。有的就敲起桌子来，嚷嚷道：“托德！演讲！托德说上一段！唱歌！唱一支托德先生的歌！”托德只轻轻地摇摇头，举起一只爪子温和地表示反对。他殷勤地劝客人们多多享用美食，偶尔就时下大家关注的话题闲聊几句，还郑重其事地问候他们家庭中尚未成年、不能参加社交集会的成员。他以此向大家传达了一个信息：这次餐会是严格按照传统方式来进行的。

托德确确实实变了个样！





这次高潮事件过后，四只动物继续快快乐乐、心满意足地过他们的日子。这种生活虽说曾经被内战野蛮地打断过一阵子，但后来再也没有受到过叛乱或入侵的骚扰。托德和朋友们好好商量一番之后，选了一条漂亮的金项链，配上一只镶珍珠的小匣子，附上一封连獾子班杰也承认很谦虚知恩的感谢信，派人送给狱卒的女儿。接下来是火车司机，他为托德吃苦受累惹麻烦，所以得到了适当的酬谢和补偿。在獾子班杰的严厉逼迫下，就连船娘也被他们费了些周折寻找到，照价赔偿了她的马。不过，托德咬牙跺脚，对这件事极其不满，坚持认为自己是命运之神的工具，是被派来惩罚那些胳膊上长斑点、有眼无珠不识真绅士的胖女人的。其实，涉及的金额并非令人无法承受：当地估价员承认，那吉卜赛人给的价大体上差不离。

在悠长的夏日黄昏里，四个朋友有时会一起在野树林里散步。对他们来说，这林子现在已经是一块温温顺顺的地方。他们散步的情景真是令人愉快哟：居民们恭恭敬敬向他们问好，黄鼠狼妈妈们把小家伙带到洞口，指着他们，说道：“瞧，宝贝儿！那就是了不起的托德先生！走在他旁边的是勇敢的兰特，一位可怕的战士！再过去一点是有名的莫尔先生，你们常听爸爸说起的就是他！”宝宝们犯倔管不住的时候，妈妈们就说，要是他们再闹，再不听话，可怕的大灰獾就会把他们抓走。这真是对班杰的可耻诽谤：事实上，虽然他对社交界不感兴趣，却是相当喜欢孩子们。可是呀，拿这种话吓唬孩子，没有一回不是百分之百奏效的。

THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS





Kenneth Grahame





Chapter I The River Bank


The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said "Bother!" and "O blow!" and also "Hang spring-cleaning!" and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, "Up we go! Up we go!" till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.

"This is fine!" he said to himself. "This is better than whitewashing!" The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.

"Hold up!" said an elderly rabbit at the gap. "Sixpence for the privilege of passing by the private road!" He was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about. "Onion-sauce! Onion-sauce!" he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started grumbling at each other. "How STUPID you are! Why didn't you tell him—" "Well, why didn't YOU say—" "You might have reminded him—" and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much too late, as is always the case.

It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting—everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering "Whitewash!" he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.

He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before—this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver—glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spellbound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.

As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just above the water's edge, caught his eye, and dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.

A brown little face, with whiskers.

A grave round face, with the same twinkle in its eye that had first attracted his notice.

Small neat ears and thick silky hair.

It was the Water Rat!

Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously.

"Hullo, Mole!" said the Water Rat.

"Hullo, Rat!" said the Mole.

"Would you like to come over?" enquired the Rat presently.

"Oh, its all very well to TALK," said the Mole, rather pettishly, he being new to a river and riverside life and its ways.

The Rat said nothing, but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled on it; then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not observed. It was painted blue outside and white within, and was just the size for two animals; and the Mole's whole heart went out to it at once, even though he did not yet fully understand its uses.

The Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his forepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. "Lean on that!" he said. "Now then, step lively!" and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found himself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.

"This has been a wonderful day!" said he, as the Rat shoved off and took to the sculls again. "Do you know, I've never been in a boat before in all my life."

"What?" cried the Rat, open-mouthed: "Never been in a—you never—well, I—what have you been doing, then?"

"Is it so nice as all that?" asked the Mole shyly, though he was quite prepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the cushions, the oars, the rowlocks, and all the fascinating fittings, and felt the boat sway lightly under him.

"Nice? It's the ONLY thing," said the Water Rat solemnly, as he leant forward for his stroke. "Believe me, my young friend, there is NOTHING—absolute nothing—half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats. Simply messing," he went on dreamily: "messing—about—in—boats; messing—"

"Look ahead, Rat!" cried the Mole suddenly.

It was too late. The boat struck the bank full tilt. The dreamer, the joyous oarsman, lay on his back at the bottom of the boat, his heels in the air.

"—about in boats—or WITH boats," the Rat went on composedly, picking himself up with a pleasant laugh. "In or out of 'em, it doesn't matter. Nothing seems really to matter, that's the charm of it. Whether you get away, or whether you don't; whether you arrive at your destination or whether you reach somewhere else, or whether you never get anywhere at all, you're always busy, and you never do anything in particular; and when you've done it there's always something else to do, and you can do it if you like, but you'd much better not. Look here! If you've really nothing else on hand this morning, supposing we drop down the river together, and have a long day of it?"

The Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness, spread his chest with a sigh of full contentment, and leaned back blissfully into the soft cushions. "WHAT a day I'm having!" he said. "Let us start at once!"

"Hold hard a minute, then!" said the Rat. He looped the painter through a ring in his landing-stage, climbed up into his hole above, and after a short interval reappeared staggering under a fat, wicker luncheon-basket.

"Shove that under your feet," he observed to the Mole, as he passed it down into the boat. Then he untied the painter and took the sculls again.

"What's inside it?" asked the Mole, wriggling with curiosity.

"There's cold chicken inside it," replied the Rat briefly; "coldtongueco ldhamcoldbeefpickledgherkinssaladfrenchrollscresssandwidgespottedmeatgingerbeerlemonadesodawater—"

"O stop, stop," cried the Mole in ecstacies: "This is too much!"

"Do you really think so?" enquired the Rat seriously. "It's only what I always take on these little excursions; and the other animals are always telling me that I'm a mean beast and cut it VERY fine!"

The Mole never heard a word he was saying. Absorbed in the new life he was entering upon, intoxicated with the sparkle, the ripple, the scents and the sounds and the sunlight, he trailed a paw in the water and dreamed long waking dreams. The Water Rat, like the good little fellow he was, sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him.

"I like your clothes awfully, old chap," he remarked after some half an hour or so had passed. "I'm going to get a black velvet smoking-suit myself some day, as soon as I can afford it."

"I beg your pardon," said the Mole, pulling himself together with an effort. "You must think me very rude; but all this is so new to me. So—this—is—a—River!"

"THE River," corrected the Rat.

"And you really live by the river? What a jolly life!"

"By it and with it and on it and in it," said the Rat. "It's brother and sister to me, and aunts, and company, and food and drink, and (naturally) washing. It's my world, and I don't want any other. What it hasn't got is not worth having, and what it doesn't know is not worth knowing. Lord! the times we've had together! Whether in winter or summer, spring or autumn, it's always got its fun and its excitements. When the floods are on in February, and my cellars and basement are brimming with drink that's no good to me, and the brown water runs by my best bedroom window; or again when it all drops away and, shows patches of mud that smells like plum-cake, and the rushes and weed clog the channels, and I can potter about dry-shod over most of the bed of it and find fresh food to eat, and things careless people have dropped out of boats!"

"But isn't it a bit dull at times?" the Mole ventured to ask. "Just you and the river, and no one else to pass a word with?"

"No one else to—well, I mustn't be hard on you," said the Rat with forbearance. "You're new to it, and of course you don't know. The bank is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether. O no, it isn't what it used to be, at all. Otters, kingfishers, dabchicks, moorhens, all of them about all day long and always wanting you to DO something—as if a fellow had no business of his own to attend to!"

"What lies over THERE" asked the Mole, waving a paw towards a background of woodland that darkly framed the water-meadows on one side of the river.

"That? O, that's just the Wild Wood," said the Rat shortly. "We don't go there very much, we river-bankers."

"Aren't they—aren't they very NICE people in there?" said the Mole, a trifle nervously.

"W-e-ll," replied the Rat, "Let me see. The squirrels are all right. AND the rabbits—some of 'em, but rabbits are a mixed lot. And then there's Badger, of course. He lives right in the heart of it; wouldn't live anywhere else, either, if you paid him to do it. Dear old Badger! Nobody interferes with HIM. They'd better not," he added significantly.

"Why, who SHOULD interfere with him?" asked the Mole.

"Well, of course—there—are others," explained the Rat in a hesitating sort of way. "Weasels—and stoats—and foxes—and so on. They're all right in a way—I'm very good friends with them—pass the time of day when we meet, and all that—but they break out sometimes, there's no denying it, and then—well, you can't really trust them, and that's the fact."

The Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell on possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the subject.

"And beyond the Wild Wood again?" he asked: "Where it's all blue and dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn't, and something like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?"

"Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World," said the Rat. "And that's something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our backwater at last, where we're going to lunch."

Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, "O my! O my! O my!"

The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket.

The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, "O my! O my!" at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, "Now, pitch in, old fellow!" and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago.

"What are you looking at?" said the Rat presently, when the edge of their hunger was somewhat dulled, and the Mole's eyes were able to wander off the table-cloth a little.

"I am looking," said the Mole, "at a streak of bubbles that I see travelling along the surface of the water. That is a thing that strikes me as funny."

"Bubbles? Oho!" said the Rat, and chirruped cheerily in an inviting sort of way.

A broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank, and the Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat.

"Greedy beggars!" he observed, making for the provender. "Why didn't you invite me, Ratty?"

"This was an impromptu affair," explained the Rat. "By the way—my friend Mr. Mole."

"Proud, I'm sure," said the Otter, and the two animals were friends forthwith.

"Such a rumpus everywhere!" continued the Otter. "all the world seems out on the river today. I came up this backwater to try and get a moment's peace, and then stumble upon you fellows!—At least—I beg pardon—I don't exactly mean that, you know."

There was a rustle behind them, proceeding from a hedge wherein last year's leaves still clung thick, and a stripy head, with high shoulders behind it, peered forth on them.

"Come on, old Badger!" shouted the Rat.

The Badger trotted forward a pace or two; then grunted, "H'm! Company," and turned his back and disappeared from view.

"That's JUST the sort of fellow he is!" observed the disappointed Rat. "Simply hates Society! Now we shan't see any more of him today. Well, tell us, WHO's out on the river?"

"Toad's out, for one," replied the Otter. "In his brand-new wager-boat; new togs, new everything!"

The two animals looked at each other and laughed.

"Once, it was nothing but sailing," said the Rat, "Then he tired of that and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day and every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was house-boating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his house-boat, and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in a house-boat. It's all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something fresh."

"Such a good fellow, too," remarked the Otter reflectively: "But no stability—especially in a boat!"

From where they sat they could get a glimpse of the main stream across the island that separated them; and just then a wager-boat flashed into view, the rower—a short, stout figure—splashing badly and rolling a good deal, but working his hardest. The Rat stood up and hailed him, but Toad—for it was he—shook his head and settled sternly to his work.

"He'll be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like that," said the Rat, sitting down again.

"Of course he will," chuckled the Otter. "Did I ever tell you that good story about Toad and the lock-keeper? It happened this way. Toad..."

An errant May-fly swerved unsteadily athwart the current in the intoxicated fashion affected by young bloods of May-flies seeing life. A swirl of water and a "cloop!" and the May-fly was visible no more.

Neither was the Otter.

The Mole looked down. The voice was still in his ears, but the turf whereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant. Not an Otter to be seen, as far as the distant horizon.

But again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river.

The Rat hummed a tune, and the Mole recollected that animal-etiquette forbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of one's friends at any moment, for any reason or no reason whatever.

"Well, well," said the Rat, "I suppose we ought to be moving. I wonder which of us had better pack the luncheon-basket?" He did not speak as if he was frightfully eager for the treat.

"O, please let me," said the Mole. So, of course, the Rat let him.

Packing the basket was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking the basket. It never is. But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything, and although just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly he saw a plate staring up at him from the grass, and when the job had been done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to have seen, and last of all, behold! the mustard pot, which he had been sitting on without knowing it—still, somehow, the thing got finished at last, without much loss of temper.

The afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards in a dreamy mood, murmuring poetry-things over to himself, and not paying much attention to Mole. But the Mole was very full of lunch, and self-satisfaction, and pride, and already quite at home in a boat (so he thought) and was getting a bit restless besides: and presently he said, "Ratty! Please, I want to row, now!"

The Rat shook his head with a smile. "Not yet, my young friend," he said—"wait till you've had a few lessons. It's not so easy as it looks."

The Mole was quiet for a minute or two. But he began to feel more and more jealous of Rat, sculling so strongly and so easily along, and his pride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well. He jumped up and seized the sculls so suddenly, that the Rat, who was gazing out over the water and saying more poetry-things to himself, was taken by surprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for the second time, while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed the sculls with entire confidence.

"Stop it, you SILLY ass!" cried the Rat, from the bottom of the boat. "You can't do it! You'll have us over!"

The Mole flung his sculls back with a flourish, and made a great dig at the water. He missed the surface altogether, his legs flew up above his head, and he found himself lying on the top of the prostrate Rat. Greatly alarmed, he made a grab at the side of the boat, and the next moment—Sploosh!

Over went the boat, and he found himself struggling in the river.

O my, how cold the water was, and O, how VERY wet it felt. How it sang in his ears as he went down, down, down! How bright and welcome the sun looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering! How black was his despair when he felt himself sinking again! Then a firm paw gripped him by the back of his neck. It was the Rat, and he was evidently laughing—the Mole could FEEL him laughing, right down his arm and through his paw, and so into his—the Mole's—neck.

The Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Mole's arm; then he did the same by the other side of him and, swimming behind, propelled the helpless animal to shore, hauled him out, and set him down on the bank, a squashy, pulpy lump of misery.

When the Rat had rubbed him down a bit, and wrung some of the wet out of him, he said, "Now, then, old fellow! Trot up and down the towing-path as hard as you can, till you're warm and dry again, while I dive for the luncheon-basket."

So the dismal Mole, wet without and ashamed within, trotted about till he was fairly dry, while the Rat plunged into the water again, recovered the boat, righted her and made her fast, fetched his floating property to shore by degrees, and finally dived successfully for the luncheon-basket and struggled to land with it.

When all was ready for a start once more, the Mole, limp and dejected, took his seat in the stern of the boat; and as they set off, he said in a low voice, broken with emotion, "Ratty, my generous friend! I am very sorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct. My heart quite fails me when I think how I might have lost that beautiful luncheon-basket. Indeed, I have been a complete ass, and I know it. Will you overlook it this once and forgive me, and let things go on as before?"

"That's all right, bless you!" responded the Rat cheerily. "What's a little wet to a Water Rat? I'm more in the water than out of it most days. Don't you think any more about it; and, look here! I really think you had better come and stop with me for a little time. It's very plain and rough, you know—not like Toad's house at all—but you haven't seen that yet; still, I can make you comfortable. And I'll teach you to row, and to swim, and you'll soon be as handy on the water as any of us."

The Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could find no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two with the back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and presently the Mole's spirits revived again, and he was even able to give some straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to each other about his bedraggled appearance.

When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and planted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down a dressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till supper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwelling animal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden floods, and leaping pike, and steamers that flung hard bottles—at least bottles were certainly flung, and FROM steamers, so presumably BY them; and about herons, and how particular they were whom they spoke to; and about adventures down drains, and night-fishings with Otter, or excursions far afield with Badger. Supper was a most cheerful meal; but very shortly afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his considerate host, to the best bedroom, where he soon laid his head on his pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing that his new-found friend the River was lappingthe sill of his window.

This day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated Mole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer moved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy of running water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at intervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly among them.





Chapter II The Open Road


"Ratty," said the Mole suddenly, one bright summer morning, "if you please, I want to ask you a favour."

The Rat was sitting on the river bank, singing a little song. He had just composed it himself, so he was very taken up with it, and would not pay proper attention to Mole or anything else. Since early morning he had been swimming in the river, in company with his friends the ducks. And when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly, as ducks will, he would dive down and tickle their necks, just under where their chins would be if ducks had chins, till they were forced to come to the surface again in a hurry, spluttering and angry and shaking their feathers at him, for it is impossible to say quite ALL you feel when your head is under water. At last they implored him to go away and attend to his own affairs and leave them to mind theirs. So the Rat went away, and sat on the river bank in the sun, and made up a song about them, which he called





"DUCKS' DITTY."





All along the backwater,

Through the rushes tall,

Ducks are a-dabbling,

Up tails all!





Ducks' tails, drakes' tails,

Yellow feet a-quiver,

Yellow bills all out of sight

Busy in the river!





Slushy green undergrowth

Where the roach swim—

Here we keep our larder,

Cool and full and dim.





Everyone for what he likes!

We like to be

Heads down, tails up,

Dabbling free!





High in the blue above

Swifts whirl and call—

We are down a-dabbling

Up tails all!





"I don't know that I think so VERY much of that little song, Rat," observed the Mole cautiously. He was no poet himself and didn't care who knew it; and he had a candid nature.

"Nor don't the ducks neither," replied the Rat cheerfully. "They say, 'WHY can't fellows be allowed to do what they like WHEN they like and AS they like, instead of other fellows sitting on banks and watching them all the time and making remarks and poetry and things about them? What NONSENSE it all is!' That's what the ducks say."

"So it is, so it is," said the Mole, with great heartiness.

"No, it isn't!" cried the Rat indignantly.

"Well then, it isn't, it isn't," replied the Mole soothingly. "But what I wanted to ask you was, won't you take me to call on Mr. Toad? I've heard so much about him, and I do so want to make his acquaintance."

"Why, certainly," said the good-natured Rat, jumping to his feet and dismissing poetry from his mind for the day. "Get the boat out, and we'll paddle up there at once. It's never the wrong time to call on Toad. Early or late he's always the same fellow. Always good-tempered, always glad to see you, always sorry when you go!"

"He must be a very nice animal," observed the Mole, as he got into the boat and took the sculls, while the Rat settled himself comfortably in the stern.

"He is indeed the best of animals," replied Rat. "So simple, so good-natured, and so affectionate. Perhaps he's not very clever—we can't all be geniuses; and it may be that he is both boastful and conceited. But he has got some great qualities, has Toady."

Rounding a bend in the river, they came in sight of a handsome, dignified old house of mellowed red brick, with well-kept lawns reaching down to the water's edge.

"There's Toad Hall," said the Rat; "and that creek on the left, where the notice-board says, 'Private. No landing allowed,' leads to his boat-house, where we'll leave the boat. The stables are over there to the right. That's the banqueting-hall you're looking at now—very old, that is. Toad is rather rich, you know, and this is really one of the nicest houses in these parts, though we never admit as much to Toad."

They glided up the creek, and the Mole slipped his sculls as they passed into the shadow of a large boat-house. Here they saw many handsome boats, slung from the cross beams or hauled up on a slip, but none in the water; and the place had an unused and a deserted air.

The Rat looked around him. "I understand," said he. "Boating is played out. He's tired of it, and done with it. I wonder what new fad he has taken up now? Come along and let's look him up. We shall hear all about it quite soon enough."

They disembarked, and strolled across the gay flower-decked lawns in search of Toad, whom they presently happened upon resting in a wicker garden-chair, with a pre-occupied expression of face, and a large map spread out on his knees.

"Hooray!" he cried, jumping up on seeing them, "this is splendid!" He shook the paws of both of them warmly, never waiting for an introduction to the Mole. "How KIND of you!" he went on, dancing round them. "I was just going to send a boat down the river for you, Ratty, with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once, whatever you were doing. I want you badly—both of you. Now what will you take? Come inside and have something! You don't know how lucky it is, your turning up just now!"

"Let's sit quiet a bit, Toady!" said the Rat, throwing himself into an easy chair, while the Mole took another by the side of him and made some civil remark about Toad's "Delightful residence."

"Finest house on the whole river," cried Toad boisterously. "Or anywhere else, for that matter," he could not help adding.

Here the Rat nudged the Mole. Unfortunately the Toad saw him do it, and turned very red. There was a moment's painful silence. Then Toad burst out laughing. "All right, Ratty," he said. "It's only my way, you know. And it's not such a very bad house, is it? You know you rather like it yourself. Now, look here. Let's be sensible. You are the very animals I wanted. You've got to help me. It's most important!"

"It's about your rowing, I suppose," said the Rat, with an innocent air. "You're getting on fairly well, though you splash a good bit still. With a great deal of patience, and any quantity of coaching, you may—"

"O, pooh! boating!" interrupted the Toad, in great disgust. "Silly boyish amusement. I've given that up LONG ago. Sheer waste of time, that's what it is. It makes me downright sorry to see you fellows, who ought to know better, spending all your energies in that aimless manner. No, I've discovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation for a lifetime. I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and can only regret the wasted years that lie behind me, squandered in trivialities. Come with me, dear Ratty, and your amiable friend also, if he will be so very good, just as far as the stable-yard, and you shall see what you shall see!"

He led the way to the stable-yard accordingly, the Rat following with a most mistrustful expression; and there, drawn out of the coach house into the open, they saw a gipsy caravan, shining with newness, painted a canary- yellow picked out with green, and red wheels.

"There you are!" cried the Toad, straddling and expanding himself. "There's real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open road, the dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the rolling downs! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here today, up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a horizon that's always changing! And mind! this is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without any exception. Come inside and look at the arrangements. Planned 'em all myself, I did!"

The Mole was tremendously interested and excited, and followed him eagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan. The Rat only snorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets, remaining where he was.

It was indeed very compact and comfortable. Little sleeping bunks—a little table that folded up against the wall—a cooking-stove, lockers, bookshelves, a bird-cage with a bird in it; and pots, pans, jugs and kettles of every size and variety.

"All complete!" said the Toad triumphantly, pulling open a locker. "You see—biscuits, potted lobster, sardines—everything you can possibly want. Soda-water here—baccy there—letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards and dominoes—you'll find," he continued, as they descended the steps again, "you'll find that nothing what ever has been forgotten, when we make our start this afternoon."

"I beg your pardon," said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw, "but did I overhear you say something about 'WE,' and 'START,' and 'THIS AFTERNOON'?"

"Now, you dear good old Ratty," said Toad, imploringly, "don't begin talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you've GOT to come. I can't possibly manage without you, so please consider it settled, and don't argue—it's the one thing I can't stand. You surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and BOAT? I want to show you the world! I'm going to make an ANIMAL of you, my boy!"

"I don't care," said the Rat, doggedly. "I'm not coming, and that's flat. And I AM going to stick to my old river, AND live in a hole, AND boat, as I've always done. And what's more, Mole's going to stick me and do as I do, aren't you, Mole?"

"Of course I am," said the Mole, loyally. "I'll always stick to you, Rat, and what you say is to be—has got to be. All the same, it sounds as if it might have been—well, rather fun, you know!" he added, wistfully. Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was so new a thing to him, and so thrilling; and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting; and he had fallen in love at first sight with the canary-coloured cart and all its little fitments.

The Rat saw what was passing in his mind, and wavered. He hated disappointing people, and he was fond of the Mole, and would do almost anything to oblige him. Toad was watching both of them closely.

"Come along in, and have some lunch," he said, diplomatically, "and we'll talk it over. We needn't decide anything in a hurry. Of course, I don't really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows. 'Live for others!'That's my motto in life."

During luncheon—which was excellent, of course, as everything at Toad Hall always was—the Toad simply let himself go. Disregarding the Rat, he proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp. Naturally a voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination, he painted the prospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the roadside in such glowing colours that the Mole could hardly sit in his chair for excitement. Somehow, it soon seemed taken for granted by all three of them that the trip was a settled thing; and the Rat, though still unconvinced in his mind, allowed his good-nature to override his personal objections. He could not bear to disappoint his two friends, who were already deep in schemes and anticipations, planning out each day's separate occupation for several weeks ahead.

When they were quite ready, the now triumphant Toad led his companions to the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without having been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told off by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition. He frankly preferred the paddock, and took a deal of catching. Meantime Toad packed the lockers still tighter with necessaries, and hung nosebags, nets of onions, bundles of hay, and baskets from the bottom of the cart. At last the horse was caught and harnessed, and they set off, all talking at once, each animal either trudging by the side of the cart or sitting on the shaft, as the humour took him. It was a golden afternoon. The smell of the dust they kicked up was rich and satisfying; out of thick orchards on either side the road, birds called and whistled to them cheerily; good-natured wayfarers, passing them, gave them "Good-day," or stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart; and rabbits, sitting at their front doors in the hedgerows, held up their fore-paws, and said, "O my ! O my ! O my!"

Late in the evening, tired and happy and miles from home, they drew up on a remote common far from habitations, turned the horse loose to graze, and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of the cart. Toad talked big about all he was going to do in the days to come, while stars grew fuller and larger all around them, and a yellow moon, appearing suddenly and silently from nowhere in particular, came to keep them company and listen to their talk. At last they turned in to their little bunks in the cart; and Toad, kicking out his legs, sleepily said, "Well, good night, you fellows! This is the real life for a gentleman! Talk about your old river!"

"I DON't talk about my river," replied the patient Rat. "You KNOW I don't, Toad. But I THINK about it," he added pathetically, in a lower tone: "I think about it—all the time!"

The Mole reached out from under his blanket, felt for the Rat's paw in the darkness, and gave it a squeeze. "I'll do whatever you like, Ratty," he whispered. "Shall we run away tomorrow morning, quite early—VERY early—and go back to our dear old hole on the river?"

"No, no, we'll see it out," whispered back the Rat. "Thanks awfully, but I ought to stick by Toad till this trip is ended. It wouldn't be safe for him to be left to himself. It won't take very long. His fads never do. Good night!"

The end was indeed nearer than even the Rat suspected.

After so much open air and excitement the Toad slept very soundly, and no amount of shaking could rouse him out of bed next morning. So the Mole and Rat turned to, quietly and manfully, and while the Rat saw to the horse, and lit a fire, and cleaned last night's cups and platters, and got things ready for breakfast, the Mole trudged off to the nearest village, a long way off, for milk and eggs and various necessaries the Toad had, of course, forgotten to provide. The hard work had all been done, and the two animals were resting, thoroughly exhausted, by the time Toad appeared on the scene, fresh and gay, remarking what a pleasant easy life it was they were all leading now, after the cares and worries and fatigues of housekeeping at home.

They had a pleasant ramble that day over grassy downs and along narrow by-lanes, and camped as before, on a common, only this time the two guests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work. In consequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by no means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life, and indeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk, whence he was hauled by force. Their way lay, as before, across country by narrow lanes, and it was not till the afternoon that they came out on the high-road, their first high-road; and there disaster, fleet and unforeseen, sprang out on them—disaster momentous indeed to their expedition, but simply overwhelming in its effect on the after-career of Toad.

They were strolling along the high-road easily, the Mole by the horse's head, talking to him, since the horse had complained that he was being frightfully left out of it, and nobody considered him in the least; the Toad and the Water Rat walking behind the cart talking together—at least Toad was talking, and Rat was saying at intervals, "Yes, precisely; and what did YOU say to HIM?" —and thinking all the time of something very different, when far behind them they heard a faint warning hum, like the drone of a distant bee. Glancing back, they saw a small cloud of dust, with a dark centre of energy, advancing on them at incredible speed, while from out the dust a faint "Poop-poop!" wailed like an uneasy animal in pain. Hardly regarding it, they turned to resume their conversation, when in an instant (as it seemed) the peaceful scene was changed, and with a blast of wind and a whirl of sound that made them jump for the nearest ditch, it was on them! The "Poop-poop" rang with a brazen shout in their ears, they had a moment's glimpse of an interior of glittering plate-glass and rich morocco, and the magnificent motor-car, immense, breath-snatching, passionate, with its pilot tense and hugging his wheel, possessed all earth and air for the fraction of a second, flung an enveloping cloud of dust that blinded and enwrapped them utterly, and then dwindled to a speck in the far distance, changed back into a droning bee once more.

The old grey horse, dreaming, as he plodded along, of his quiet paddock, in a new raw situation such as this simply abandoned himself to his natural emotions. Rearing, plunging, backing steadily, in spite of all the Mole's efforts at his head, and all the Mole's lively language directed at his better feelings, he drove the cart backwards towards the deep ditch at the side of the road. It wavered an instant—then there was a heartrending crash—and the canary-coloured cart, their pride and their joy, lay on its side in the ditch, an irredeemable wreck.

The Rat danced up and down in the road, simply transported with passion. "You villains!" he shouted, shaking both fists. "You scoundrels, you highwaymen, you—you—roadhogs!—I'll have the law of you! I'll report you! I'll take you through all the Courts!" His home-sickness had quite slipped away from him, and for the moment he was the skipper of the canary-coloured vessel driven on a shoal by the reckless jockeying of rival mariners, and he was trying to recollect all the fine and biting things he used to say to masters of steam-launches when their wash, as they drove too near the bank, used to flood his parlour-carpet at home.

Toad sat straight down in the middle of the dusty road, his legs stretched out before him, and stared fixedly in the direction of the disappearing motor-car. He breathed short, his face wore a placid satisfied expression, and at intervals he faintly murmured "Poop-poop!"

The Mole was busy trying to quiet the horse, which he succeeded in doing after a time. Then he went to look at the cart, on its side in the ditch. It was indeed a sorry sight. Panels and windows smashed, axles hopelessly bent, one wheel off, sardine-tins scattered over the wide world, and the bird in the bird-cage sobbing pitifully and calling to be let out.

The Rat came to help him, but their united efforts were not sufficient to right the cart. "Hi! Toad!" they cried. "Come and bear a hand, can't you!"

The Toad never answered a word, or budged from his seat in the road; so they went to see what was the matter with him. They found him in a sort of a trance, a happy smile on his face, his eyes still fixed on the dusty wake of their destroyer. At intervals he was still heard to murmur "Poop-poop!"

The Rat shook him by the shoulder. "Are you coming to help us, Toad?" he demanded sternly.

"Glorious, stirring sight!" murmured Toad, never offering to move. "The poetry of motion! The REAL way to travel! The ONLY way to travel! Here today—in next week tomorrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped—always somebody else's horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O my!"

"O STOP being an ass, Toad!" cried the Mole despairingly.

"And to think I never KNEW!" went on the Toad in a dreamy monotone. "all those wasted years that lie behind me, I never knew, never even DREAMT! But NOW—but now that I know, now that I fully realise! O what a flowery track lies spread before me, henceforth! What dust-clouds shall spring up behind me as I speed on my reckless way! What carts I shall fling carelessly into the ditch in the wake of my magnificent onset! Horrid little carts—common carts—canary-coloured carts!"

"What are we to do with him?" asked the Mole of the Water Rat.

"Nothing at all," replied the Rat firmly. "Because there is really nothing to be done. You see, I know him from of old. He is now possessed. He has got a new craze, and it always takes him that way, in its first stage. He'll continue like that for days now, like an animal walking in a happy dream, quite useless for all practical purposes. Never mind him. Let's go and see what there is to be done about the cart."

A careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in righting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles were in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into pieces.

The Rat knotted the horse's reins over his back and took him by the head, carrying the bird cage and its hysterical occupant in the other hand. "Come on!" he said grimly to the Mole. "It's five or six miles to the nearest town, and we shall just have to walk it. The sooner we make a start the better."

"But what about Toad?" asked the Mole anxiously, as they set off together. "We can't leave him here, sitting in the middle of the road by himself, in the distracted state he's in! It's not safe. Supposing another Thing were to come along?"

"O, BOTHER Toad," said the Rat savagely; "I've done with him!"

They had not proceeded very far on their way, however, when there was a pattering of feet behind them, and Toad caught them up and thrust a paw inside the elbow of each of them; still breathing short and staring into vacancy.

"Now, look here, Toad!" said the Rat sharply: "as soon as we get to the town, you'll have to go straight to the police-station, and see if they know anything about that motor-car and who it belongs to, and lodge a complaint against it. And then you'll have to go to a blacksmith's or a wheelwright's and arrange for the cart to be fetched and mended and put to rights. It'll take time, but it's not quite a hopeless smash. Meanwhile, the Mole and I will go to an inn and find comfortable rooms where we can stay till the cart's ready, and till your nerves have recovered their shock."

"Police-station! Complaint!" murmured Toad dreamily. "Me COMPLAIN of that beautiful, that heavenly vision that has been vouchsafed me! MEND THE CART! I've done with carts for ever. I never want to see the cart, or to hear of it, again. O, Ratty! You can't think how obliged I am to you for consenting to come on this trip! I wouldn't have gone without you, and then I might never have seen that—that swan, that sunbeam, that thunderbolt! I might never have heard that entrancing sound, or smelt that bewitching smell! I owe it all to you, my best of friends!"

The Rat turned from him in despair. "You see what it is?" he said to the Mole, addressing him across Toad's head: "He's quite hopeless. I give it up—when we get to the town we'll go to the railway station, and with luck we may pick up a train there that'll get us back to riverbank tonight. And if ever you catch me going a-pleasuring with this provoking animal again!" —He snorted, and during the rest of that weary trudge addressed his remarks exclusively to Mole.

On reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited Toad in the second-class waiting-room, giving a porter twopence to keep a strict eye on him. They then left the horse at an inn stable, and gave what directions they could about the cart and its contents. Eventually, a slow train having landed them at a station not very far from Toad Hall, they escorted the spell-bound, sleep-walking Toad to his door, put him inside it, and instructed his housekeeper to feed him, undress him, and put him to bed. Then they got out their boat from the boat-house, sculled down the river home, and at a very late hour sat down to supper in their own cosy riverside parlour, to the Rat's great joy and contentment.

The following evening the Mole, who had risen late and taken things very easy all day, was sitting on the bank fishing, when the Rat, who had been looking up his friends and gossiping, came strolling along to find him. "Heard the news?" he said. "There's nothing else being talked about, all along the river bank. Toad went up to Town by an early train this morning. And he has ordered a large and very expensive motor-car."





Chapter III The Wild Wood


The Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He seemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though rarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place. But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat he always found himself put off. "It's all right," the Rat would say. "Badger'll turn up some day or other—he's always turning up—and then I'll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him AS you find him, but WHEN you find him."

"Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?" said the Mole.

"He wouldn't come," replied the Rat simply. "Badger hates Society, and invitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing."

"Well, then, supposing we go and call on HIM?" suggested the Mole.

"O, I'm sure he wouldn't like that at ALL," said the Rat, quite alarmed. "He's so very shy, he'd be sure to be offended. I've never even ventured to call on him at his own home myself, though I know him so well. Besides, we can't. It's quite out of the question, because he lives in the very middle of the Wild Wood."

"Well, supposing he does," said the Mole. "You told me the Wild Wood was all right, you know."

"O, I know, I know, so it is," replied the Rat evasively. "But I think we won't go there just now. Not JUST yet. It's a long way, and he wouldn't be at home at this time of year anyhow, and he'll be coming along some day, if you'll wait quietly."

The Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along, and every day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was long over, and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and the swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that mocked at boating of any sort or kind, that he found his thoughts dwelling again with much persistence on the solitary grey Badger, who lived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle of the Wild Wood.

In the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and rising late. During his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other small domestic jobs about the house; and, of course, there were always animals dropping in for a chat, and consequently there was a good deal of story-telling and comparing notes on the past summer and all its doings.

Such a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all! With illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple loosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow. Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.

And what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while wind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen mornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet undispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the shock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant transformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was with them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid-day, deep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden shafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles along dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool evening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many friendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow. There was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good deal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in his armchair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes that wouldn't fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself and explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr. Badger.

It was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he slipped out of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare and entirely leafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter day when Nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places, which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while, till they could riot in rich masquerade as before, and trick and entice him with the old deceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering—even exhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country undecorated, hard, and stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare bones of it, and they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which lay before him low and threatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.

There was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his feet, logs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and startled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar and far away; but that was all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he penetrated to where the light was less, and trees crouched nearer and nearer, and holes made ugly mouths at him on either side.

Everything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily, rapidly, gathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be draining away like flood-water.

Then the faces began.

It was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he saw a face: a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a hole. When he turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.

He quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin imagining things, or there would be simply no end to it. He passed another hole, and another, and another; and then—yes!—no!—yes! certainly a little narrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an instant from a hole, and was gone. He hesitated—braced himself up for an effort and strode on. Then suddenly, as if it had been so all the time, every hole, far and near, and there were hundreds of them, seemed to possess its face, coming and going rapidly, all fixing on him glances of malice and hatred: all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.

If he could only get away from the holes in the banks, he thought, there would be no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into the untrodden places of the wood.

Then the whistling began.

Very faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard it; but somehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and shrill, it sounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to go back. As he halted in indecision it broke out on either side, and seemed to be caught up and passed on throughout the whole length of the wood to its farthest limit. They were up and alert and ready, evidently, whoever they were! And he—he was alone, and unarmed, and far from any help; and the night was closing in.

Then the pattering began.

He thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate was the sound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he knew it for nothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a very long way off. Was it in front or behind? It seemed to be first one, and then the other, then both. It grew and it multiplied, till from every quarter as he listened anxiously, leaning this way and that, it seemed to be closing in on him. As he stood still to hearken, a rabbit came running hard towards him through the trees. He waited, expecting it to slacken pace, or to swerve from him into a different course. Instead, the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his face set and hard, his eyes staring. "Get out of this, you fool, get out!" the Mole heard him mutter as he swung round a stump and disappeared down a friendly burrow.

The pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dryleafcarpet spread around him. The whole wood seemed running now, running hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or—somebody? In panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran up against things, he fell over things and into things, he darted under things and dodged round things. At last he took refuge in the deep dark hollow of an old beech tree, which offered shelter, concealment—perhaps even safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he was too tired to run any further and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had drifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for the time. And as he lay there panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the patterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread thing which other little dwellers in field and hedgerow had encountered here, and known as their darkest moment—that thing which the Rat had vainly tried to shield him from—the Terror of the Wild Wood!

Meantime the Rat, warm and comfortable, dozed by his fireside. His paper of half-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell back, his mouth opened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of dream-rivers. Then a coal slipped, the fire crackled and sent up a spurt of flame, and he woke with a start. Remembering what he had been engaged upon, he reached down to the floor for his verses, pored over them for a minute, and then looked round for the Mole to ask him if he knew a good rhyme for something or other.

But the Mole was not there.

He listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.

Then he called "Moly!" several times, and, receiving no answer, got up and went out into the hall.

The Mole's cap was missing from its accustomed peg. His goloshes, which always lay by the umbrella-stand, were also gone.

The Rat left the house, and carefully examined the muddy surface of the ground outside, hoping to find the Mole's tracks. There they were, sure enough. The goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the pimples on their soles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints of them in the mud, running along straight and purposeful, leading direct to the Wild Wood.

The Rat looked very grave, and stood in deep thought for a minute or two. Then he re-entered the house, strapped a belt round his waist, shoved a brace of pistols into it, took up a stout cudgel that stood in a corner of the hall, and set off for the Wild Wood at a smart pace.

It was already getting towards dusk when he reached the first fringe of trees and plunged without hesitation into the wood, looking anxiously on either side for any sign of his friend. Here and there wicked little faces popped out of holes, but vanished immediately at sight of the valorous animal, his pistols, and the great ugly cudgel in his grasp; and the whistling and pattering, which he had heard quite plainly on his first entry, died away and ceased, and all was very still. He made his way manfully through the length of the wood, to its furthest edge; then, forsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it, laboriously working over the whole ground, and all the time calling out cheerfully, "Moly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It's me—it's old Rat!"

He had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more, when at last to his joy he heard a little answering cry. Guiding himself by the sound, he made his way through the gathering darkness to the foot of an old beech tree, with a hole in it, and from out of the hole came a feeble voice, saying, "Ratty! Is that really you?"

The Rat crept into the hollow, and there he found the Mole, exhausted and still trembling. "O, Rat!" he cried, "I've been so frightened, you can't think!"

"O, I quite understand," said the Rat soothingly. "You shouldn't really have gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you from it. We river-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to come, we come in couples, at least; then we're generally all right. Besides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand all about and you don't, as yet. I mean passwords, signs, and sayings which have power and effect, and plants you carry in your pocket, and verses you repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise; all simple enough when you know them, but they've got to be known if you're small, or you'll find yourself in trouble. Of course if you were Badger or Otter, it would be quite another matter."

"Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn't mind coming here by himself, would he?" inquired the Mole.

"Old Toad?" said the Rat, laughing heartily. "He wouldn't show his face here alone, not for a whole hatful of golden guineas, Toad wouldn't."

The Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat's careless laughter, as well as by the sight of his stick and his gleaming pistols, and he stopped shivering and began to feel bolder and more himself again.

"Now then," said the Rat presently, "We really must pull ourselves together and make a start for home while there's still a little light left. It will never do to spend the night here, you understand. Too cold, for one thing."

"Dear Ratty," said the poor Mole, "I'm dreadfully sorry, but I'm simply dead beat and that's a solid fact. You MUST let me rest here a while longer, and get my strength back, if I'm to get home at all."

"O, all right," said the good-natured Rat, "rest away. It's pretty nearly pitch dark now, anyhow; and there ought to be a bit of a moon later."

So the Mole got well into the dry leaves and stretched himself out, and presently dropped off into sleep, though of a broken and troubled sort; while the Rat covered himself up, too, as best he might, for warmth, and lay patiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.

When at last the Mole woke up, much refreshed and in his usual spirits, the Rat said, "Now then! I'll just take a look outside and see if everything's quiet, and then we really must be off."

He went to the entrance of their retreat and put his head out. Then the Mole heard him saying quietly to himself, "Hullo! hullo! here—IS—a—go!"

"What's up, Ratty?" asked the Mole.

"SNOW is up," replied the Rat briefly; "or rather, DOWN. It's snowing hard."

The Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood that had been so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes, hollows, pools, pitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer were vanishing fast, and a gleaming carpet of faery was springing up everywhere, that looked too delicate to be trodden upon by rough feet. A fine powder filled the air and caressed the cheek with a tingle in its touch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in a light that seemed to come from below.

"Well, well, it can't be helped," said the Rat, after pondering. "We must make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The worst of it is, I don't exactly know where we are. And now this snow makes everything look so very different."

It did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same wood. However, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed most promising, holding on to each other and pretending with invincible cheerfulness that they recognized an old friend in every fresh tree that grimly and silently greeted them, or saw openings, gaps, or paths with a familiar turn in them, in the monotony of white space and black tree-trunks that refused to vary.

An hour or two later—they had lost all count of time—they pulled up, dispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen tree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done. They were aching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen into several holes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep that they could hardly drag their little legs through it, and the trees were thicker and more like each other than ever. There seemed to be no end to this wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst of all, no way out.

"We can't sit here very long," said the Rat. "We shall have to make another push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too awful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade through." He peered about him and considered. "Look here," he went on, "this is what occurs to me. There's a sort of dell down here in front of us, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky. We'll make our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter, a cave or hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and there we'll have a good rest before we try again, for we're both of us pretty dead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may turn up."

So once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell, where they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a protection from the keen wind and the whirling snow. They were investigating one of the hummocky bits the Rat had spoken of, when suddenly the Mole tripped up and fell forward on his face with a squeal.

"O my leg!" he cried. "O, my poor shin!" and he sat up on the snow and nursed his leg in both his front paws.

"Poor old Mole!" said the Rat kindly. "You don't seem to be having much luck today, do you? Let's have a look at the leg. Yes," he went on, going down on his knees to look, "you've cut your shin, sure enough. Wait till I get at my handkerchief, and I'll tie it up for you."

"I must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stump," said the Mole miserably. "O, my! O, my!"

"It's a very clean cut," said the Rat, examining it again attentively. "That was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it was made by a sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!" He pondered awhile, and examined the humps and slopes that surrounded them.

"Well, never mind what done it," said the Mole, forgetting his grammar in his pain. "It hurts just the same, whatever done it."

But the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, had left him and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shovelled and explored, all four legs working busily, while the Mole waited impatiently, remarking at intervals, "O, COME on, Rat!"

Suddenly the Rat cried "Hooray!" and then "Hooray-oo-ray-oo-ray-oo-ray!" and fell to executing a feeble jig in the snow.

"What HAVE you found, Ratty?" asked the Mole, still nursing his leg.

"Come and see!" said the delighted Rat, as he jigged on.

The Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look. "Well," he said at last, slowly, "I SEE it right enough. Seen the same sort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A door-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?"

"But don't you see what it MEANS, you—you dull-witted animal?" cried the Rat impatiently.

"Of course I see what it means," replied the Mole. "It simply means that some VERY careless and forgetful person has left his door-scraper lying about in the middle of the Wild Wood, JUST where it's SURE to trip EVERYBODY up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get home I shall go and complain about it to—to somebody or other, see if I don't!"

"O, dear! O, dear!" cried the Rat, in despair at his obtuseness. "Here, stop arguing and come and scrape!" And he set to work again and made the snow fly in all directions around him.

After some further toil his efforts were rewarded, and a very shabby door-mat lay exposed to view.

"There, what did I tell you?" exclaimed the Rat in great triumph.

"Absolutely nothing whatever," replied the Mole, with perfect truthfulness. "Well now," he went on, "you seem to have found another piece of domestic litter, done for and thrown away, and I suppose you're perfectly happy. Better go ahead and dance your jig round that if you've got to, and get it over, and then perhaps we can go on and not waste any more time over rubbish-heaps. Can we EAT a door-mat? Or sleep under a door-mat? Or sit on a door-mat and sledge home over the snow on it, you exasperating rodent?"

"Do—you—mean—to—say," cried the excited Rat, "That this doormat doesn't TELL you anything?"

"Really, Rat," said the Mole, quite pettishly, "I think we'd had enough of this folly. Who ever heard of a door-mat TELLING anyone anything? They simply don't do it. They are not that sort at all. Door-mats know their place."

"Now look here, you—you thick-headed beast," replied the Rat, really angry, "This must stop. Not another word, but scrape—scrape and scratch and dig and hunt round, especially on the sides of the hummocks, if you want to sleep dry and warm tonight, for it's our last chance!"

The Rat attacked a snow-bank beside them with ardour, probing with his cudgel everywhere and then digging with fury; and the Mole scraped busily too, more to oblige the Rat than for any other reason, for his opinion was that his friend was getting light-headed.

Some ten minutes' hard work, and the point of the Rat's cudgel struck something that sounded hollow. He worked till he could get a paw through and feel; then called the Mole to come and help him. Hard at it went the two animals, till at last the result of their labours stood full in view of the astonished and hitherto incredulous Mole.

In the side of what had seemed to be a snow-bank stood a solid-looking little door, painted a dark green. An iron bell-pull hung by the side, and below it, on a small brass plate, neatly engraved in square capital letters, they could read by the aid of moonlight: —





MR. BADGER





The Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight. "Rat!" he cried in penitence, "you're a wonder! A real wonder, that's what you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step by step, in that wise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my shin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to itself, 'Door-scraper!' And then you turned to and found the very door-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would have been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working. 'Let me only just find a door-mat,' says you to yourself, 'and my theory is proved!' And of course you found your doormat. You're so clever, I believe you could find anything you liked. 'Now,'says you, 'That door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There's nothing else remains to be done but to find it!' Well, I've read about that sort of thing in books, but I've never come across it before in real life. You ought to go where you'll be properly appreciated. You're simply wasted here, among us fellows. If I only had your head, Ratty—"

"But as you haven't," interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly, "I suppose you're going to sit on the snow all night and TALK? Get up at once and hang on to that bell-pull you see there, and ring hard, as hard as you can, while I hammer!"

While the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole sprang up at the bell-pull, clutched it and swung there, both feet well off the ground, and from quite a long way off they could faintly hear a deep-toned bell respond.





Chapter IV Mr. Badger


They waited patiently for what seemed a very long time, stamping in the snow to keep their feet warm. At last they heard the sound of slow shuffling footsteps approaching the door from the inside. It seemed, as the Mole remarked to the Rat, like some one walking in carpet slippers that were too large for him and down-at-heel; which was intelligent of Mole, because that was exactly what it was.

There was the noise of a bolt shot back, and the door opened a few inches, enough to show a long snout and a pair of sleepy blinking eyes.

"Now, the VERY next time this happens," said a gruff and suspicious voice, "I shall be exceedingly angry. Who is it THIS time, disturbing people on such a night? Speak up!"

"Oh, Badger," cried the Rat, "Let us in, please. It's me, Rat, and my friend Mole, and we've lost our way in the snow."

"What, Ratty, my dear little man!" exclaimed the Badger, in quite a different voice. "Come along in, both of you, at once. Why, you must be perished. Well I never! Lost in the snow! And in the Wild Wood, too, and at this time of night! But come in with you."

The two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get inside, and heard the door shut behind them with great joy and relief.

The Badger, who wore a long dressing-gown, and whose slippers were indeed very down-at-heel, carried a flat candlestick in his paw and had probably been on his way to bed when their summons sounded. He looked kindly down on them and patted both their heads. "This is not the sort of night for small animals to be out," he said paternally. "I'm afraid you've been up to some of your pranks again, Ratty. But come along; come into the kitchen. There's a first-rate fire there, and supper and everything."

He shuffled on in front of them, carrying the light, and they followed him, nudging each other in an anticipating sort of way, down a long, gloomy, and, to tell the truth, decidedly shabby passage, into a sort of a central hall, out of which they could dimly see other long tunnel-like passages branching, passages mysterious and without apparent end. But there were doors in the hall as well—stout oaken comfortable-looking doors. One of these the Badger flung open, and at once they found themselves in all the glow and warmth of a large fire-lit kitchen.

The floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire of logs, between two attractive chimney-corners tucked away in the wall, well out of any suspicion of draught. A couple of high-backed settles, facing each other on either side of the fire, gave further sitting accommodations for the sociably disposed. In the middle of the room stood a long table of plain boards placed on trestles, with benches down each side. At one end of it, where an arm-chair stood pushed back, were spread the remains of the Badger's plain but ample supper. Rows of spotless plates winked from the shelves of the dresser at the far end of the room, and from the rafters overhead hung hams, bundles of dried herbs, nets of onions, and baskets of eggs. It seemed a place where heroes could fitly feast after victory, where weary harvesters could line up in scores along the table and keep their Harvest Home with mirth and song, or where two or three friends of simple tastes could sit about as they pleased and eat and smoke and talk in comfort and contentment. The ruddy brick floor smiled up at the smoky ceiling; the oaken settles, shiny with long wear, exchanged cheerful glances with each other; plates on the dresser grinned at pots on the shelf, and the merry firelight flickered and played over everything without distinction.

The kindly Badger thrust them down on a settle to toast themselves at the fire, and bade them remove their wet coats and boots. Then he fetched them dressing-gowns and slippers, and himself bathed the Mole's shin with warm water and mended the cut with sticking-plaster till the whole thing was just as good as new, if not better. In the embracing light and warmth, warm and dry at last, with weary legs propped up in front of them, and a suggestive clink of plates being arranged on the table behind, it seemed to the storm-driven animals, now in safe anchorage, that the cold and trackless Wild Wood just left outside was miles and miles away, and all that they had suffered in it a half-forgotten dream.

When at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to the table, where he had been busy laying a repast. They had felt pretty hungry before, but when they actually saw at last the supper that was spread for them, really it seemed only a question of what they should attack first where all was so attractive, and whether the other things would obligingly wait for them till they had time to give them attention. Conversation was impossible for a long time; and when it was slowly resumed, it was that regrettable sort of conversation that results from talking with your mouth full. The Badger did not mind that sort of thing at all, nor did he take any notice of elbows on the table, or everybody speaking at once. As he did not go into Society himself, he had got an idea that these things belonged to the things that didn't really matter. (We know of course that he was wrong, and took too narrow a view; because they do matter very much, though it would take too long to explain why.) He sat in his arm-chair at the head of the table, and nodded gravely at intervals as the animals told their story; and he did not seem surprised or shocked at anything, and he never said, "I told you so," or, "Just what I always said," or remarked that they ought to have done so-and-so, or ought not to have done something else. The Mole began to feel very friendly towards him.

When supper was really finished at last, and each animal felt that his skin was now as tight as was decently safe, and that by this time he didn't care a hang for anybody or anything, they gathered round the glowing embers of the great wood fire, and thought how jolly it was to be sitting up SO late, and SO independent, and SO full; and after they had chatted for a time about things in general, the Badger said heartily, "Now then! tell us the news from your part of the world. How's old Toad going on?"

"Oh, from bad to worse," said the Rat gravely, while the Mole, cocked up on a settle and basking in the firelight, his heels higher than his head, tried to look properly mournful. "Another smash-up only last week, and a bad one. You see, he will insist on driving himself, and he's hopelessly incapable. If he'd only employ a decent, steady, well-trained animal, pay him good wages, and leave everything to him, he'd get on all right. But no; he's convinced he's a heaven-born driver, and nobody can teach him anything; and all the rest follows."

"How many has he had?" inquired the Badger gloomily.

"Smashes, or machines?" asked the Rat. "Oh, well, after all, it's the same thing—with Toad. This is the seventh. As for the others—you know that coach-house of his? Well, it's piled up—literally piled up to the roof—with fragments of motor-cars, none of them bigger than your hat! That accounts for the other six—so far as they can be accounted for."

"He's been in hospital three times," put in the Mole; "and as for the fines he's had to pay, it's simply awful to think of."

"Yes, and that's part of the trouble," continued the Rat. "Toad's rich, we all know; but he's not a millionaire. And he's a hopelessly bad driver, and quite regardless of law and order. Killed or ruined— it's got to be one of the two things, sooner or later. Badger! we're his friends—oughtn't we to do something?"

The Badger went through a bit of hard thinking. "Now look here!" he said at last, rather severely; "of course you know I can't do anything NOW?"

His two friends assented, quite understanding his point. No animal, according to the rules of animal-etiquette, is ever expected to do anything strenuous, or heroic, or even moderately active during the off-season of winter. All are sleepy—some actually asleep. All are weather-bound, more or less; and all are resting from arduous days and nights, during which every muscle in them has been severely tested, and every energy kept at full stretch.

"Very well then!" continued the Badger. "BUT, when once the year has really turned, and the nights are shorter, and half-way through them one rouses and feels fidgety and wanting to be up and doing by sunrise, if not before—YOU know!—"

Both animals nodded gravely. THEY knew!

"Well, THEN," went on the Badger, "we—that is, you and me and our friend the Mole here—we'll take Toad seriously in hand. We'll stand no nonsense whatever. We'll bring him back to reason, by force if need be. We'll MAKE him be a sensible Toad. We'll—you're asleep, Rat!"

"Not me!" said the Rat, waking up with a jerk.

"He's been asleep two or three times since supper," said the Mole, laughing. He himself was feeling quite wakeful and even lively, though he didn't know why. The reason was, of course, that he being naturally an underground animal by birth and breeding, the situation of Badger's house exactly suited him and made him feel at home; while the Rat, who slept every night in a bedroom the windows of which opened on a breezy river, naturally felt the atmosphere still and oppressive.

"Well, it's time we were all in bed," said the Badger, getting up and fetching flat candlesticks. "Come along, you two, and I'll show you your quarters. And take your time tomorrow morning—breakfast at any hour you please!"

He conducted the two animals to a long room that seemed half bedchamber and half loft. The Badger's winter stores, which indeed were visible everywhere, took up half the room—piles of apples, turnips, and potatoes, baskets full of nuts, and jars of honey; but the two little white beds on the remainder of the floor looked soft and inviting, and the linen on them, though coarse, was clean and smelt beautifully of lavender; and the Mole and the Water Rat, shaking off their garments in some thirty seconds, tumbled in between the sheets in great joy and contentment.

In accordance with the kindly Badger's injunctions, the two tired animals came down to breakfast very late next morning, and found a bright fire burning in the kitchen, and two young hedgehogs sitting on a bench at the table, eating oatmeal porridge out of wooden bowls. The hedgehogs dropped their spoons, rose to their feet, and ducked their heads respectfully as the two entered.

"There, sit down, sit down," said the Rat pleasantly, "and go on with your porridge. Where have you youngsters come from? Lost your way in the snow, I suppose?"

"Yes, please, sir," said the elder of the two hedgehogs respectfully. "Me and little Billy here, we was trying to find our way to school— mother WOULD have us go, was the weather ever so—and of course we lost ourselves, sir, and Billy he got frightened and took and cried, being young and faint-hearted. And at last we happened up against Mr. Badger's back door, and made so bold as to knock, sir, for Mr. Badger he's a kind-hearted gentleman, as everyone knows—"

"I understand," said the Rat, cutting himself some rashers from a side of bacon, while the Mole dropped some eggs into a saucepan. "And what's the weather like outside? You needn't 'sir' me quite so much?" he added.

"O, terrible bad, sir, terrible deep the snow is," said the hedgehog. "No getting out for the likes of you gentlemen today."

"Where's Mr. Badger?" inquired the Mole, as he warmed the coffee-pot before the fire.

"The master's gone into his study, sir," replied the hedgehog, "and he said as how he was going to be particular busy this morning, and on no account was he to be disturbed."

This explanation, of course, was thoroughly understood by every one present. The fact is, as already set forth, when you live a life of intense activity for six months in the year, and of comparative or actual somnolence for the other six, during the latter period you cannot be continually pleading sleepiness when there are people about or things to be done. The excuse gets monotonous. The animals well knew that Badger, having eaten a hearty breakfast, had retired to his study and settled himself in an arm-chair with his legs up on another and a red cotton handkerchief over his face, and was being "busy" in the usual way at this time of the year.

The front-door bell clanged loudly, and the Rat, who was very greasy with buttered toast, sent Billy, the smaller hedgehog, to see who it might be. There was a sound of much stamping in the hall, and presently Billy returned in front of the Otter, who threw himself on the Rat with an embrace and a shout of affectionate greeting.

"Get off!" spluttered the Rat, with his mouth full.

"Thought I should find you here all right," said the Otter cheerfully. "They were all in a great state of alarm along River Bank when I arrived this morning. Rat never been home all night—nor Mole either—something dreadful must have happened, they said; and the snow had covered up all your tracks, of course. But I knew that when people were in any fix they mostly went to Badger, or else Badger got to know of it somehow, so I came straight off here, through the Wild Wood and the snow! My! it was fine, coming through the snow as the red sun was rising and showing against the black tree-trunks! As you went along in the stillness, every now and then masses of snow slid off the branches suddenly with a flop! making you jump and run for cover. Snow-castles and snow-caverns had sprung up out of nowhere in the night—and snow bridges, terraces, ramparts—I could have stayed and played with them for hours. Here and there great branches had been torn away by the sheer weight of the snow, and robins perched and hopped on them in their perky conceited way, just as if they had done it themselves. A ragged string of wild geese passed overhead, high on the grey sky, and a few rooks whirled over the trees, inspected, and flapped off homewards with a disgusted expression; but I met no sensible being to ask the news of. About halfway across I came on a rabbit sitting on a stump, cleaning his silly face with his paws. He was a pretty scared animal when I crept up behind him and placed a heavy fore-paw on his shoulder. I had to cuff his head once or twice to get any sense out of it at all. At last I managed to extract from him that Mole had been seen in the Wild Wood last night by one of them. It was the talk of the burrows, he said, how Mole, Mr. Rat's particular friend, was in a bad fix; how he had lost his way, and 'They' were up and out hunting, and were chivvying him round and round. 'Then why didn't any of you DO something?' I asked. 'You mayn't be blest with brains, but there are hundreds and hundreds of you, big stout fellows, as fat as butter, and your burrows running in all directions, and you could have taken him in and made him safe and comfortable, or tried to, at all events.''What, US?' he merely said: 'DO something? us rabbits?' So I cuffed him again and left him. There was nothing else to be done. At any rate, I had learnt something; and if I had had the luck to meet any of 'Them' I'd have learnt something more—or THEY would."

"Weren't you at all—er—nervous?" asked the Mole, some of yesterday's terror coming back to him at the mention of the Wild Wood.

"Nervous?" The Otter showed a gleaming set of strong white teeth as he laughed. "I'd give 'em nerves if any of them tried anything on with me. Here, Mole, fry me some slices of ham, like the good little chap you are. I'm frightfully hungry, and I've got any amount to say to Ratty here. Haven't seen him for an age."

So the good-natured Mole, having cut some slices of ham, set the hedgehogs to fry it, and returned to his own breakfast, while the Otter and the Rat, their heads together, eagerly talked river-shop, which is long shop and talk that is endless, running on like the babbling river itself.

A plate of fried ham had just been cleared and sent back for more, when the Badger entered, yawning and rubbing his eyes, and greeted them all in his quiet, simple way, with kind enquiries for every one. "It must be getting on for luncheon time," he remarked to the Otter. "Better stop and have it with us. You must be hungry, this cold morning."

"Rather!" replied the Otter, winking at the Mole. "The sight of these greedy young hedgehogs stuffing themselves with fried ham makes me feel positively famished."

The hedgehogs, who were just beginning to feel hungry again after their porridge, and after working so hard at their frying, looked timidly up at Mr. Badger, but were too shy to say anything.

"Here, you two youngsters be off home to your mother," said the Badger kindly. "I'll send some one with you to show you the way. You won't want any dinner today, I'll be bound."

He gave them sixpence apiece and a pat on the head, and they went off with much respectful swinging of caps and touching of forelocks.

Presently they all sat down to luncheon together. The Mole found himself placed next to Mr. Badger, and, as the other two were still deep in river-gossip from which nothing could divert them, he took the opportunity to tell Badger how comfortable and home-like it all felt to him. "Once well underground," he said, "you know exactly where you are. Nothing can happen to you, and nothing can get at you. You're entirely your own master, and you don't have to consult anybody or mind what they say. Things go on all the same overhead, and you let 'em, and don't bother about 'em. When you want to, up you go, and there the things are, waiting for you."

The Badger simply beamed on him. "That's exactly what I say," he replied. "There's no security, or peace and tranquillity, except underground. And then, if your ideas get larger and you want to expand—why, a dig and a scrape, and there you are! If you feel your house is a bit too big, you stop up a hole or two, and there you are again! No builders, no tradesmen, no remarks passed on you by fellows looking over your wall, and, above all, no WEATHER. Look at Rat, now. A couple of feet of flood water, and he's got to move into hired lodgings; uncomfortable, inconveniently situated, and horribly expensive. Take Toad. I say nothing against Toad Hall; quite the best house in these parts, AS a house. But supposing a fire breaks out—where's Toad? Supposing tiles are blown off, or walls sink or crack, or windows get broken—where's Toad? Supposing the rooms are draughty—I HATE a draught myself—where's Toad? No, up and out of doors is good enough to roam about and get one's living in; but underground to come back to at last—that's my idea of HOME!"

The Mole assented heartily; and the Badger in consequence got very friendly with him. "When lunch is over," he said, "I'll take you all round this little place of mine. I can see you'll appreciate it. You understand what domestic architecture ought to be, you do."

After luncheon, accordingly, when the other two had settled themselves into the chimney-corner and had started a heated argument on the subject of EELS, the Badger lighted a lantern and bade the Mole follow him. Crossing the hall, they passed down one of the principal tunnels, and the wavering light of the lantern gave glimpses on either side of rooms both large and small, some mere cupboards, others nearly as broad and imposing as Toad's dining-hall. A narrow passage at right angles led them into another corridor, and here the same thing was repeated. The Mole was staggered at the size, the extent, the ramifications of it all; at the length of the dim passages, the solid vaultings of the crammed store-chambers, the masonry everywhere, the pillars, the arches, the pavements. "How on earth, Badger," he said at last, "did you ever find time and strength to do all this? It's astonishing!"

"It WOULD be astonishing indeed," said the Badger simply, "if I HAD done it. But as a matter of fact I did none of it—only cleaned out the passages and chambers, as far as I had need of them. There's lots more of it, all round about. I see you don't understand, and I must explain it to you. Well, very long ago, on the spot where the Wild Wood waves now, before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now is, there was a city—a city of people, you know. Here, where we are standing, they lived, and walked, and talked, and slept, and carried on their business. Here they stabled their horses and feasted, from here they rode out to fight or drove out to trade. They were a powerful people, and rich, and great builders. They built to last, for they thought their city would last for ever."

"But what has become of them all?" asked the Mole.

"Who can tell?" said the Badger. "People come—they stay for a while, they flourish, they build—and they go. It is their way. But we remain. There were badgers here, I've been told, long before that same city ever came to be. And now there are badgers here again. We are an enduring lot, and we may move out for a time, but we wait, and are patient, and back we come. And so it will ever be."

"Well, and when they went at last, those people?" said the Mole.

"When they went," continued the Badger, "The strong winds and persistent rains took the matter in hand, patiently, ceaselessly, year after year. Perhaps we badgers too, in our small way, helped a little—who knows? It was all down, down, down, gradually—ruin and levelling and disappearance. Then it was all up, up, up, gradually, as seeds grew to saplings, and saplings to forest trees, and bramble and fern came creeping in to help. Leaf-mould rose and obliterated, streams in their winter freshets brought sand and soil to clog and to cover, and in course of time our home was ready for us again, and we moved in. Up above us, on the surface, the same thing happened. Animals arrived, liked the look of the place, took up their quarters, settled down, spread, and flourished. They didn't bother themselves about the past—they never do; they're too busy. The place was a bit humpy and hillocky, naturally, and full of holes; but that was rather an advantage. And they don't bother about the future, either—the future when perhaps the people will move in again—for a time—as may very well be. The Wild Wood is pretty well populated by now; with all the usual lot, good, bad, and indifferent—I name no names. It takes all sorts to make a world. But I fancy you know something about them yourself by this time."

"I do indeed," said the Mole, with a slight shiver.

"Well, well," said the Badger, patting him on the shoulder, "it was your first experience of them, you see. They're not so bad really; and we must all live and let live. But I'll pass the word around tomorrow, and I think you'll have no further trouble. Any friend of MINE walks where he likes in this country, or I'll know the reason why!"

When they got back to the kitchen again, they found the Rat walking up and down, very restless. The underground atmosphere was oppressing him and getting on his nerves, and he seemed really to be afraid that the river would run away if he wasn't there to look after it. So he had his overcoat on, and his pistols thrust into his belt again. "Come along, Mole," he said anxiously, as soon as he caught sight of them. "We must get off while it's daylight. Don't want to spend another night in the Wild Wood again."

"It'll be all right, my fine fellow," said the Otter. "I'm coming along with you, and I know every path blindfold; and if there's a head that needs to be punched, you can confidently rely upon me to punch it."

"You really needn't fret, Ratty," added the Badger placidly. "My passages run further than you think, and I've bolt-holes to the edge of the wood in several directions, though I don't care for everybody to know about them. When you really have to go, you shall leave by one of my short cuts. Meantime, make yourself easy, and sit down again."

The Rat was nevertheless still anxious to be off and attend to his river, so the Badger, taking up his lantern again, led the way along a damp and airless tunnel that wound and dipped, part vaulted, part hewn through solid rock, for a weary distance that seemed to be miles. At last daylight began to show itself confusedly through tangled growth overhanging the mouth of the passage; and the Badger, bidding them a hasty good-bye, pushed them hurriedly through the opening, made everything look as natural as possible again, with creepers, brushwood, and dead leaves, and retreated.

They found themselves standing on the very edge of the Wild Wood. Rocks and brambles and tree-roots behind them, confusedly heaped and tangled; in front, a great space of quiet fields, hemmed by lines of hedges black on the snow, and, far ahead, a glint of the familiar old river, while the wintry sun hung red and low on the horizon. The Otter, as knowing all the paths, took charge of the party, and they trailed out on a bee-line for a distant stile. Pausing there a moment and looking back, they saw the whole mass of the Wild Wood, dense, menacing, compact, grimly set in vast white surroundings; simultaneously they turned and made swiftly for home, for firelight and the familiar things it played on, for the voice, sounding cheerily outside their window, of the river that they knew and trusted in all its moods, that never made them afraid with any amazement.

As he hurried along, eagerly anticipating the moment when he would be at home again among the things he knew and liked, the Mole saw clearly that he was an animal of tilled field and hedgerow, linked to the ploughed furrow, the frequented pasture, the lane of evening lingerings, the cultivated garden-plot. For others the asperities, the stubborn endurance, or the clash of actual conflict, that went with Nature in the rough; he must be wise, must keep to the pleasant places in which his lines were laid and which held adventure enough, in their way, to last for a lifetime.





Chapter V Dulce Domum


The sheep ran huddling together against the hurdles, blowing out thin nostrils and stamping with delicate forefeet, their heads thrown back and a light steam rising from the crowded sheep-pen into the frosty air, as the two animals hastened by in high spirits, with much chatter and laughter. They were returning across country after a long day's outing with Otter, hunting and exploring on the wide uplands where certain streams tributary to their own River had their first small beginnings; and the shades of the short winter day were closing in on them, and they had still some distance to go. Plodding at random across the plough, they had heard the sheep and had made for them; and now, leading from the sheep-pen, they found a beaten track that made walking a lighter business, and responded, moreover, to that small inquiring something which all animals carry inside them, saying unmistakably, "Yes, quite right; THIS leads home!"

"It looks as if we were coming to a village," said the Mole somewhat dubiously, slackening his pace, as the track, that had in time become a path and then had developed into a lane, now handed them over to the charge of a well-metalled road. The animals did not hold with villages, and their own highways, thickly frequented as they were, took an independent course, regardless of church, post office, or public-house.

"Oh, never mind!" said the Rat. "At this season of the year they're all safe indoors by this time, sitting round the fire; men, women, and children, dogs and cats and all. We shall slip through all right, without any bother or unpleasantness, and we can have a look at them through their windows if you like, and see what they're doing."

The rapid nightfall of mid-December had quite beset the little village as they approached it on soft feet over a first thin fall of powdery snow. Little was visible but squares of a dusky orange-red on either side of the street, where the firelight or lamplight of each cottage overflowed through the casements into the dark world without. Most of the low latticed windows were innocent of blinds, and to the lookers-in from outside, the inmates, gathered round the tea-table, absorbed in handiwork, or talking with laughter and gesture, had each that happy grace which is the last thing the skilled actor shall capture—the natural grace which goes with perfect unconsciousness of observation. Moving at will from one theatre to another, the two spectators, so far from home themselves, had something of wistfulness in their eyes as they watched a cat being stroked, a sleepy child picked up and huddled off to bed, or a tired man stretch and knock out his pipe on the end of a smouldering log.

But it was from one little window, with its blind drawn down, a mere blank transparency on the night, that the sense of home and the little curtained world within walls—the larger stressful world of outside Nature shut out and forgotten—most pulsated. Close against the white blind hung a bird-cage, clearly silhouetted, every wire, perch, and appurtenance distinct and recognisable, even to yesterday's dull-edged lump of sugar. On the middle perch the fluffy occupant, head tucked well into feathers, seemed so near to them as to be easily stroked, had they tried; even the delicate tips of his plumped-out plumage pencilled plainly on the illuminated screen. As they looked, the sleepy little fellow stirred uneasily, woke, shook himself, and raised his head. They could see the gape of his tiny beak as he yawned in a bored sort of way, looked round, and then settled his head into his back again, while the ruffled feathers gradually subsided into perfect stillness. Then a gust of bitter wind took them in the back of the neck, a small sting of frozen sleet on the skin woke them as from a dream, and they knew their toes to be cold and their legs tired, and their own home distant a weary way.

Once beyond the village, where the cottages ceased abruptly, on either side of the road they could smell through the darkness the friendly fields again; and they braced themselves for the last long stretch, the home stretch, the stretch that we know is bound to end, some time, in the rattle of the door-latch, the sudden firelight, and the sight of familiar things greeting us as long-absent travellers from far over-sea. They plodded along steadily and silently, each of them thinking his own thoughts. The Mole's ran a good deal on supper, as it was pitch-dark, and it was all a strange country for him as far as he knew, and he was following obediently in the wake of the Rat, leaving the guidance entirely to him. As for the Rat, he was walking a little way ahead, as his habit was, his shoulders humped, his eyes fixed on the straight grey road in front of him; so he did not notice poor Mole when suddenly the summons reached him, and took him like an electric shock.

We others, who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses, have not even proper terms to express an animal's intercommunications with his surroundings, living or otherwise, and have only the word "smell," for instance, to include the whole range of delicate thrills which murmur in the nose of the animal night and day, summoning, warning, inciting, repelling. It was one of these mysterious fairy calls from out the void that suddenly reached Mole in the darkness, making him tingle through and through with its very familiar appeal, even while yet he could not clearly remember what it was. He stopped dead in his tracks, his nose searching hither and thither in its efforts to recapture the fine filament, the telegraphic current, that had so strongly moved him. A moment, and he had caught it again; and with it this time came recollection in fullest flood.

Home! That was what they meant, those caressing appeals, those soft touches wafted through the air, those invisible little hands pulling and tugging, all one way! Why, it must be quite close by him at that moment, his old home that he had hurriedly forsaken and never sought again, that day when he first found the river! And now it was sending out its scouts and its messengers to capture him and bring him in. Since his escape on that bright morning he had hardly given it a thought, so absorbed had he been in his new life, in all its pleasures, its surprises, its fresh and captivating experiences. Now, with a rush of old memories, how clearly it stood up before him, in the darkness! Shabby indeed, and small and poorly furnished, and yet his, the home he had made for himself, the home he had been so happy to get back to after his day's work. And the home had been happy with him, too, evidently, and was missing him, and wanted him back, and was telling him so, through his nose, sorrowfully, reproachfully, but with no bitterness or anger; only with plaintive reminder that it was there, and wanted him.

The call was clear, the summons was plain. He must obey it instantly, and go. "Ratty!" he called, full of joyful excitement, "hold on! Come back! I want you, quick!"

"Oh, COME along, Mole, do!" replied the Rat cheerfully, still plodding along.

"PLEASE stop, Ratty!" pleaded the poor Mole, in anguish of heart. "You don't understand! It's my home, my old home! I've just come across the smell of it, and it's close by here, really quite close. And I MUST go to it, I must, I must! Oh, come back, Ratty! Please, please come back!"

The Rat was by this time very far ahead, too far to hear clearly what the Mole was calling, too far to catch the sharp note of painful appeal in his voice. And he was much taken up with the weather, for he too could smell something—something suspiciously like approaching snow.

"Mole, we mustn't stop now, really!" he called back. "We'll come for it tomorrow, whatever it is you've found. But I daren't stop now— it's late, and the snow's coming on again, and I'm not sure of the way! And I want your nose, Mole, so come on quick, there's a good fellow!" And the Rat pressed forward on his way without waiting for an answer.

Poor Mole stood alone in the road, his heart torn asunder, and a big sob gathering, gathering, somewhere low down inside him, to leap up to the surface presently, he knew, in passionate escape. But even under such a test as this his loyalty to his friend stood firm. Never for a moment did he dream of abandoning him. Meanwhile, the wafts from his old home pleaded, whispered, conjured, and finally claimed him imperiously. He dared not tarry longer within their magic circle. With a wrench that tore his very heartstrings he set his face down the road and followed submissively in the track of the Rat, while faint, thin little smells, still dogging his retreating nose, reproached him for his new friendship and his callous forgetfulness.

With an effort he caught up to the unsuspecting Rat, who began chattering cheerfully about what they would do when they got back, and how jolly a fire of logs in the parlour would be, and what a supper he meant to eat; never noticing his companion's silence and distressful state of mind. At last, however, when they had gone some considerable way further, and were passing some tree-stumps at the edge of a copse that bordered the road, he stopped and said kindly, "Look here, Mole, old chap, you seem dead tired. No talk left in you, and your feet dragging like lead. We'll sit down here for a minute and rest. The snow has held off so far, and the best part of our journey is over."

The Mole subsided forlornly on a tree-stump and tried to control himself, for he felt it surely coming. The sob he had fought with so long refused to be beaten. Up and up, it forced its way to the air, and then another, and another, and others thick and fast; till poor Mole at last gave up the struggle, and cried freely and helplessly and openly, now that he knew it was all over and he had lost what he could hardly be said to have found.

The Rat, astonished and dismayed at the violence of Mole's paroxysm of grief, did not dare to speak for a while. At last he said, very quietly and sympathetically, "What is it, old fellow? Whatever can be the matter? Tell us your trouble, and let me see what I can do."

Poor Mole found it difficult to get any words out between the upheavals of his chest that followed one upon another so quickly and held back speech and choked it as it came. "I know it's a—shabby, dingy little place," he sobbed forth at last, brokenly: "not like—your cosy quarters—or Toad's beautiful hall—or Badger's great house—but it was my own little home—and I was fond of it—and I went away and forgot all about it—and then I smelt it suddenly—on the road, when I called and you wouldn't listen, Rat—and everything came back to me with a rush—and I WANTED it!—O dear, O dear!—and when you WOULDN't turn back, Ratty—and I had to leave it, though I was smelling it all the time—I thought my heart would break.—We might have just gone and had one look at it, Ratty— only one look—it was close by—but you wouldn't turn back, Ratty, you wouldn't turn back! O dear, O dear!"

Recollection brought fresh waves of sorrow, and sobs again took full charge of him, preventing further speech.

The Rat stared straight in front of him, saying nothing, only patting Mole gently on the shoulder. After a time he muttered gloomily, "I see it all now! What a PIG I have been! A pig—that's me! Just a pig—a plain pig!"

He waited till Mole's sobs became gradually less stormy and more rhythmical; he waited till at last sniffs were frequent and sobs only intermittent. Then he rose from his seat, and, remarking carelessly, "well, now we'd really better be getting on, old chap!" set off up the road again, over the toilsome way they had come.

"Wherever are you (hic) going to (hic), Ratty?" cried the tearful Mole, looking up in alarm.

"We're going to find that home of yours, old fellow," replied the Rat pleasantly; "so you had better come along, for it will take some finding, and we shall want your nose."

"O, come back, Ratty, do!" cried the Mole, getting up and hurrying after him. "It's no good, I tell you! It's too late, and too dark, and the place is too far off, and the snow's coming! And—and I never meant to let you know I was feeling that way about it—it was all an accident and a mistake! And think of River Bank, and your supper!"

"Hang River Bank, and supper too!" said the Rat heartily. "I tell you, I'm going to find this place now, if I stay out all night. So cheer up, old chap, and take my arm, and we'll very soon be back there again."

Still snuffling, pleading, and reluctant, Mole suffered himself to be dragged back along the road by his imperious companion, who by a flow of cheerful talk and anecdote endeavoured to beguile his spirits back and make the weary way seem shorter. When at last it seemed to the Rat that they must be nearing that part of the road where the Mole had been "held up," he said, "now, no more talking. Business! Use your nose, and give your mind to it."

They moved on in silence for some little way, when suddenly the Rat was conscious, through his arm that was linked in Mole's, of a faint sort of electric thrill that was passing down that animal's body. Instantly he disengaged himself, fell back a pace, and waited, all attention.

The signals were coming through!

Mole stood a moment rigid, while his uplifted nose, quivering slightly, felt the air.

Then a short, quick run forward—a fault—a check—a try back; and then a slow, steady, confident advance.

The Rat, much excited, kept close to his heels as the Mole, with something of the air of a sleepwalker, crossed a dry ditch, scrambled through a hedge, and nosed his way over a field open and trackless and bare in the faint starlight.

Suddenly, without giving warning, he dived; but the Rat was on the alert, and promptly followed him down the tunnel to which his unerring nose had faithfully led him.

It was close and airless, and the earthy smell was strong, and it seemed a long time to Rat ere the passage ended and he could stand erect and stretch and shake himself. The Mole struck a match, and by its light the Rat saw that they were standing in an open space, neatly swept and sanded underfoot, and directly facing them was Mole's little front door, with "Mole End" painted, in Gothic lettering, over the bell-pull at the side.

Mole reached down a lantern from a nail on the wall and lit it, and the Rat, looking round him, saw that they were in a sort of fore-court. A garden-seat stood on one side of the door, and on the other, a roller; for the Mole, who was a tidy animal when at home, could not stand having his ground kicked up by other animals into little runs that ended in earth-heaps. On the walls hung wire baskets with ferns in them, alternating with brackets carrying plaster statuary—Garibaldi, and the infant Samuel, and Queen Victoria, and other heroes of modern Italy. Down on one side of the fore-court ran a skittle-alley, with benches along it and little wooden tables marked with rings that hinted at beer-mugs. In the middle was a small round pond containing goldfish and surrounded by a cockle-shell border. Out of the centre of the pond rose a fanciful erection clothed in more cockle-shells and topped by a large silvered glass ball that reflected everything all wrong and had a very pleasing effect.

Mole's facebeamed at the sight of all these objects so dear to him, and he hurried Rat through the door, lit a lamp in the hall, and took one glance round his old home. He saw the dust lying thick on everything, saw the cheerless, deserted look of the long-neglected house, and its narrow, meagre dimensions, its worn and shabby contents—and collapsed again on a hall-chair, his nose to his paws. "O Ratty!" he cried dismally, "why ever did I do it? Why did I bring you to this poor, cold little place, on a night like this, when you might have been at River Bank by this time, toasting your toes before a blazing fire, with all your own nice things about you!"

The Rat paid no heed to his doleful self-reproaches. He was running here and there, opening doors, inspecting rooms and cupboards, and lighting lamps and candles and sticking them up everywhere. "What a capital little house this is!" he called out cheerily. "So compact! So well planned! Everything here and everything in its place! We'll make a jolly night of it. The first thing we want is a good fire; I'll see to that—I always know where to find things. So this is the parlour? Splendid! Your own idea, those little sleeping-bunks in the wall? Capital! Now, I'll fetch the wood and the coals, and you get a duster, Mole—you'll find one in the drawer of the kitchen table—and try and smarten things up a bit. Bustle about, old chap!"

Encouraged by his inspiriting companion, the Mole roused himself and dusted and polished with energy and heartiness, while the Rat, running to and fro with armfuls of fuel, soon had a cheerful blaze roaring up the chimney. He hailed the Mole to come and warm himself; but Mole promptly had another fit of the blues, dropping down on a couch in dark despair and burying his face in his duster.

"Rat," he moaned, "how about your supper, you poor, cold, hungry, weary animal? I've nothing to give you—nothing—not a crumb!"

"What a fellow you are for giving in!" said the Rat reproachfully. "Why, only just now I saw a sardine-opener on the kitchen dresser, quite distinctly; and everybody knows that means there are sardines about somewhere in the neighbourhood. Rouse yourself! pull yourself together, and come with me and forage."

They went and foraged accordingly, hunting through every cupboard and turning out every drawer. The result was not so very depressing after all, though of course it might have been better; a tin of sardines—a box of captain's biscuits, nearly full—and a German sausage encased in silver paper.

"There's a banquet for you!" observed the Rat, as he arranged the table. "I know some animals who would give their ears to be sitting down to supper with us tonight!"

"No bread!" groaned the Mole dolorously; "no butter, no—"

"No pâté de foie gras, no champagne!" continued the Rat, grinning. "And that reminds me—what's that little door at the end of the passage? Your cellar, of course! Every luxury in this house! Just you wait a minute."

He made for the cellar-door, and presently reappeared, somewhat dusty, with a bottle of beer in each paw and another under each arm. "Self-indulgent beggar you seem to be, Mole," he observed. "Deny yourself nothing. This is really the jolliest little place I ever was in. Now, wherever did you pick up those prints? Make the place look so home-like, they do. No wonder you're so fond of it, Mole. Tell us all about it, and how you came to make it what it is."

Then, while the Rat busied himself fetching plates, and knives and forks, and mustard which he mixed in an egg-cup, the Mole, his bosom still heaving with the stress of his recent emotion, related—somewhat shyly at first, but with more freedom as he warmed to his subject—how this was planned, and how that was thought out, and how this was got through a windfall from an aunt, and that was a wonderful find and a bargain, and this other thing was bought out of laborious savings and a certain amount of "going without." His spirits finally quite restored, he must needs go and caress his possessions, and take a lamp and show off their points to his visitor and expatiate on them, quite forgetful of the supper they both so much needed; Rat, who was desperately hungry but strove to conceal it, nodding seriously, examining with a puckered brow, and saying, "Wonderful," and "most remarkable," at intervals, when the chance for an observation was given him.

At last the Rat succeeded in decoying him to the table, and had just got seriously to work with the sardine-opener when sounds were heard from the fore-court without—sounds like the scuffling of small feet in the gravel and a confused murmur of tiny voices, while broken sentences reached them—"Now, all in a line—hold the lantern up a bit, Tommy—clear your throats first—no coughing after I say one, two, three.—Where's young Bill?—Here, come on, do, we're all a-waiting—"

"What's up?" inquired the Rat, pausing in his labours.

"I think it must be the field-mice," replied the Mole, with a touch of pride in his manner. "They go round carol-singing regularly at this time of the year. They're quite an institution in these parts. And they never pass me over—they come to Mole End last of all; and I used to give them hot drinks, and supper too sometimes, when I could afford it. It will be like old times to hear them again."

"Let's have a look at them!" cried the Rat, jumping up and running to the door.

It was a pretty sight, and a seasonable one, that met their eyes when they flung the door open. In the fore-court, lit by the dim rays of a horn lantern, some eight or ten little field-mice stood in a semicircle, red worsted comforters round their throats, their fore-paws thrust deep into their pockets, their feet jigging for warmth. With bright beady eyes they glanced shyly at each other, sniggering a little, sniffing and applying coat-sleeves a good deal. As the door opened, one of the elder ones that carried the lantern was just saying, "Now then, one, two, three!" and forthwith their shrill little voices uprose on the air, singing one of the old-time carols that their forefathers composed in fields that were fallow and held by frost, or when snow-bound in chimney corners, and handed down to be sung in the miry street to lamp-lit windows at Yule-time.

CAROL





Villagers all, this frosty tide,

Let your doors swing open wide,

Though wind may follow, and snow beside,

Yet draw us in by your fire to bide;

Joy shall be yours in the morning!





Here we stand in the cold and the sleet,

Blowing fingers and stamping feet,

Come from far away you to greet—

You by the fire and we in the street—

Bidding you joy in the morning!





For ere one half of the night was gone,

Sudden a star has led us on,

Raining bliss and benison—

Bliss tomorrow and more anon,

Joy for every morning!





Goodman Joseph toiled through the snow—

Saw the star o'er a stable low;

Mary she might not further go—

Welcome thatch, and litter below!

Joy was hers in the morning!





And then they heard the angels tell

"Who were the first to cry Nowell?

Animals all, as it befell,

In the stable where they did dwell!

Joy shall be theirs in the morning!"





The voices ceased, the singers, bashful but smiling, exchanged sidelong glances, and silence succeeded—but for a moment only. Then, from up above and far away, down the tunnel they had so lately travelled was borne to their ears in a faint musical hum the sound of distant bells ringing a joyful and clangorous peal.

"Very well sung, boys!" cried the Rat heartily. "And now come along in, all of you, and warm yourselves by the fire, and have something hot!"

"Yes, come along, field-mice," cried the Mole eagerly. "This is quite like old times! Shut the door after you. Pull up that settle to the fire. Now, you just wait a minute, while we—O, Ratty!" he cried in despair, plumping down on a seat, with tears impending. "Whatever are we doing? We've nothing to give them!"

"You leave all that to me," said the masterful Rat. "Here, you with the lantern! Come over this way. I want to talk to you. Now, tell me, are there any shops open at this hour of the night?"

"Why, certainly, sir," replied the field-mouse respectfully. "At this time of the year our shops keep open to all sorts of hours."

"Then look here!" said the Rat. "You go off at once, you and your lantern, and you get me—"

Here much muttered conversation ensued, and the Mole only heard bits of it, such as—"Fresh, mind!—no, a pound of that will do—see you get Buggins's, for I won't have any other—no, only the best—if you can't get it there, try somewhere else—yes, of course, homemade, no tinned stuff—well then, do the best you can!" Finally, there was a chink of coin passing from paw to paw, the field-mouse was provided with an ample basket for his purchases, and off he hurried, he and his lantern.

The rest of the field-mice, perched in a row on the settle, their small legs swinging, gave themselves up to enjoyment of the fire, and toasted their chilblains till they tingled; while the Mole, failing to draw them into easy conversation, plunged into family history and made each of them recite the names of his numerous brothers, who were too young, it appeared, to be allowed to go out a-carolling this year, but looked forward very shortly to winning the parental consent.

The Rat, meanwhile, was busy examining the label on one of the beer-bottles. "I perceive this to be Old Burton," he remarked approvingly. "SENSIBLE Mole! The very thing! Now we shall be able to mull some ale! Get the things ready, Mole, while I draw the corks."

It did not take long to prepare the brew and thrust the tin heater well into the red heart of the fire; and soon every field-mouse was sipping and coughing and choking (for a little mulled ale goes a long way) and wiping his eyes and laughing and forgetting he had ever been cold in all his life.

"They act plays too, these fellows," the Mole explained to the Rat. "Make them up all by themselves, and act them afterwards. And very well they do it, too! They gave us a capital one last year, about a field-mouse who was captured at sea by a Barbary corsair, and made to row in a galley; and when he escaped and got home again, his lady-love had gone into a convent. Here, YOU! You were in it, I remember. Get up and recite a bit."

The field-mouse addressed got up on his legs, giggled shyly, looked round the room, and remained absolutely tongue-tied. His comrades cheered him on, Mole coaxed and encouraged him, and the Rat went so far as to take him by the shoulders and shake him; but nothing could overcome his stage-fright. They were all busily engaged on him like watermen applying the Royal Humane Society's regulations to a case of long submersion, when the latch clicked, the door opened, and the field-mouse with the lantern reappeared, staggering under the weight of his basket.

There was no more talk of play-acting once the very real and solid contents of the basket had been tumbled out on the table. Under the generalship of Rat, everybody was set to do something or to fetch something. In a very few minutes supper was ready, and Mole, as he took the head of the table in a sort of a dream, saw a lately barren board set thick with savoury comforts; saw his little friends' faces brighten and beam as they fell to without delay; and then let himself loose—for he was famished indeed—on the provender so magically provided, thinking what a happy homecoming this had turned out, after all. As they ate, they talked of old times, and the field-mice gave him the local gossip up to date, and answered as well as they could the hundred questions he had to ask them. The Rat said little or nothing, only taking care that each guest had what he wanted, and plenty of it, and that Mole had no trouble or anxiety about anything.

They clattered off at last, very grateful and showering wishes of the season, with their jacket pockets stuffed with remembrances for the small brothers and sisters at home. When the door had closed on the last of them and the chink of the lanterns had died away, Mole and Rat kicked the fire up, drew their chairs in, brewed themselves a last nightcap of mulled ale, and discussed the events of the long day. At last the Rat, with a tremendous yawn, said, "Mole, old chap, I'm ready to drop. Sleepy is simply not the word. That your own bunk over on that side? Very well, then, I'll take this. What a ripping little house this is! Everything so handy!"

He clambered into his bunk and rolled himself well up in the blankets, and slumber gathered him forthwith, as a swathe of barley is folded into the arms of the reaping machine.

The weary Mole also was glad to turn in without delay, and soon had his head on his pillow, in great joy and contentment. But ere he closed his eyes he let them wander round his old room, mellow in the glow of the firelight that played or rested on familiar and friendly things which had long been unconsciously a part of him, and now smilingly received him back, without rancour. He was now in just the frame of mind that the tactful Rat had quietly worked to bring about in him. He saw clearly how plain and simple—how narrow, even—it all was; but clearly, too, how much it all meant to him, and the special value of some such anchorage in one's existence. He did not at all want to abandon the new life and its splendid spaces, to turn his back on sun and air and all they offered him and creep home and stay there; the upper world was all too strong, it called to him still, even down there, and he knew he must return to the larger stage. But it was good to think he had this to come back to, this place which was all his own, these things which were so glad to see him again and could always be counted upon for the same simple welcome.





Chapter VI Mr. Toad


It was a bright morning in the early part of summer; the river had resumed its wonted banks and its accustomed pace, and a hot sun seemed to be pulling everything green and bushy and spiky up out of the earth towards him, as if by strings. The Mole and the Water Rat had been up since dawn very busy on matters connected with boats and the opening of the boating season; painting and varnishing, mending paddles, repairing cushions, hunting for missing boathooks, and so on; and were finishing breakfast in their little parlour and eagerly discussing their plans for the day, when a heavy knock sounded at the door.

"Bother!" said the Rat, all over egg. "See who it is, Mole, like a good chap, since you've finished."

The Mole went to attend the summons, and the Rat heard him utter a cry of surprise. Then he flung the parlour door open, and announced with much importance, "Mr. Badger!"

This was a wonderful thing, indeed, that the Badger should pay a formal call on them, or indeed on anybody. He generally had to be caught, if you wanted him badly, as he slipped quietly along a hedgerow of an early morning or a late evening, or else hunted up in his own house in the middle of the Wood, which was a serious undertaking.

The Badger strode heavily into the room, and stood looking at the two animals with an expression full of seriousness. The Rat let his egg-spoon fall on the table cloth, and sat open-mouthed.

"The hour has come!" said the Badger at last with great solemnity.

"What hour?" asked the Rat uneasily, glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece.

"WHOSE hour, you should rather say," replied the Badger. "Why, Toad's hour! The hour of Toad! I said I would take him in hand as soon as the winter was well over, and I'm going to take him in hand today!"

"Toad's hour, of course!" cried the Mole delightedly. "Hooray! I remember now! WE'LL teach him to be a sensible Toad!"

"This very morning," continued the Badger, taking an arm-chair, "as I learnt last night from a trustworthy source, another new and exceptionally powerful motor-car will arrive at Toad Hall on approval or return. At this very moment, perhaps, Toad is busy arraying himself in those singularly hideous habiliments so dear to him, which transform him from a (comparatively) good-looking Toad into an Object which throws any decent-minded animal that comes across it into a violent fit. We must be up and doing, ere it is too late. You two animals will accompany me instantly to Toad Hall, and the work of rescue shall be accomplished."

"Right you are!" cried the Rat, starting up. "We'll rescue the poor unhappy animal! We'll convert him! He'll be the most converted Toad that ever was before we've done with him!"

They set off up the road on their mission of mercy, Badger leading the way. Animals when in company walk in a proper and sensible manner, in single file, instead of sprawling all across the road and being of no use or support to each other in case of sudden trouble or danger.

They reached the carriage-drive of Toad Hall to find, as the Badger had anticipated, a shiny new motor-car, of great size, painted a bright red (Toad's favourite colour), standing in front of the house. As they neared the door it was flung open, and Mr. Toad, arrayed in goggles, cap, gaiters, and enormous overcoat, came swaggering down the steps, drawing on his gauntleted gloves.

"Hullo! come on, you fellows!" he cried cheerfully on catching sight of them. "You're just in time to come with me for a jolly—to come for a jolly—for a—er—jolly—"

His hearty accents faltered and fell away as he noticed the stern unbending look on the countenances of his silent friends, and his invitation remained unfinished.

The Badger strode up the steps. "Take him inside," he said sternly to his companions. Then, as Toad was hustled through the door, struggling and protesting, he turned to the chauffeur in charge of the new motor-car.

"I'm afraid you won't be wanted today," he said. "Mr. Toad has changed his mind. He will not require the car. Please understand that this is final. You needn't wait." Then he followed the others inside and shut the door.

"Now then!" he said to the Toad, when the four of them stood together in the hall, "first of all, take those ridiculous things off!"

"Shan't!" replied Toad, with great spirit. "What is the meaning of this gross outrage? I demand an instant explanation."

"Take them off him, then, you two," ordered the Badger briefly.

They had to lay Toad out on the floor, kicking and calling all sorts of names, before they could get to work properly. Then the Rat sat on him, and the Mole got his motor-clothes off him bit by bit, and they stood him up on his legs again. A good deal of his blustering spirit seemed to have evaporated with the removal of his fine panoply. Now that he was merely Toad, and no longer the Terror of the Highway, he giggled feebly and looked from one to the other appealingly, seeming quite to understand the situation.

"You knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad," the Badger explained severely. "You've disregarded all the warnings we've given you, you've gone on squandering the money your father left you, and you're getting us animals a bad name in the district by your furious driving and your smashes and your rows with the police. Independence is all very well, but we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves beyond a certain limit; and that limit you've reached. Now, you're a good fellow in many respects, and I don't want to be too hard on you. I'll make one more effort to bring you to reason. You will come with me into the smoking-room, and there you will hear some facts about yourself; and we'll see whether you come out of that room the same Toad that you went in."

He took Toad firmly by the arm, led him into the smoking-room, and closed the door behind them.

"THAT's no good!" said the Rat contemptuously. "TALKING to Toad'll never cure him. He'll SAY anything."

They made themselves comfortable in arm-chairs and waited patiently. Through the closed door they could just hear the long continuous drone of the Badger's voice, rising and falling in waves of oratory; and presently they noticed that the sermon began to be punctuated at intervals by longdrawn sobs, evidently proceeding from the bosom of Toad, who was a soft-hearted and affectionate fellow, very easily converted—for the time being—to any point of view.

After some three-quarters of an hour the door opened, and the Badger reappeared, solemnly leading by the paw a very limp and dejected Toad. His skin hung baggily about him, his legs wobbled, and his cheeks were furrowed by the tears so plentifully called forth by the Badger's moving discourse.

"Sit down there, Toad," said the Badger kindly, pointing to a chair. "My friends," he went on, "I am pleased to inform you that Toad has at last seen the error of his ways. He is truly sorry for his misguided conduct in the past, and he has undertaken to give up motor-cars entirely and for ever. I have his solemn promise to that effect."

"That is very good news," said the Mole gravely.

"Very good news indeed," observed the Rat dubiously, "if only—IF only—"

He was looking very hard at Toad as he said this, and could not help thinking he perceived something vaguely resembling a twinkle in that animal's still sorrowful eye.

"There's only one thing more to be done," continued the gratified Badger. "Toad, I want you solemnly to repeat, before your friends here, what you fully admitted to me in the smoking-room just now. First, you are sorry for what you've done, and you see the folly of it all?"

There was a long, long pause. Toad looked desperately this way and that, while the other animals waited in grave silence. At last he spoke.

"No!" he said, a little sullenly, but stoutly; "I'm NOT sorry. And it wasn't folly at all! It was simply glorious!"

"What?" cried the Badger, greatly scandalised. "You backsliding animal, didn't you tell me just now, in there—"

"Oh, yes, yes, in THERE," said Toad impatiently. "I'd have said anything in THERE. You're so eloquent, dear Badger, and so moving, and so convincing, and put all your points so frightfully well—you can do what you like with me in THERE, and you know it. But I've been searching my mind since, and going over things in it, and I find that I'm not a bit sorry or repentant really, so it's no earthly good saying I am; now, is it?"

"Then you don't promise," said the Badger, "never to touch a motorcar again?"

"Certainly not!" replied Toad emphatically. "On the contrary, I faithfully promise that the very first motor-car I see, poop-poop! Off I go in it!"

"Told you so, didn't I?" observed the Rat to the Mole.

"Very well, then," said the Badger firmly, rising to his feet. "Since you won't yield to persuasion, we'll try what force can do. I feared it would come to this all along. You've often asked us three to come and stay with you, Toad, in this handsome house of yours; well, now we're going to. When we've converted you to a proper point of view we may quit, but not before. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him up in his bedroom, while we arrange matters between ourselves."

"It's for your own good, Toady, you know," said the Rat kindly, as Toad, kicking and struggling, was hauled up the stairs by his two faithful friends. "Think what fun we shall all have together, just as we used to, when you've quite got over this—this painful attack of yours!"

"We'll take great care of everything for you till you're well, Toad," said the Mole; "and we'll see your money isn't wasted, as it has been."

"No more of those regrettable incidents with the police, Toad," said the Rat, as they thrust him into his bedroom.

"And no more weeks in hospital, being ordered about by female nurses, Toad," added the Mole, turning the key on him.

They descended the stair, Toad shouting abuse at them through the keyhole; and the three friends then met in conference on the situation.

"It's going to be a tedious business," said the Badger, sighing. "I've never seen Toad so determined. However, we will see it out. He must never be left an instant unguarded. We shall have to take it in turns to be with him, till the poison has worked itself out of his system."

They arranged watches accordingly. Each animal took it in turns to sleep in Toad's room at night, and they divided the day up between them. At first Toad was undoubtedly very trying to his careful guardians. When his violent paroxysms possessed him he would arrange bedroom chairs in rude resemblance of a motor-car and would crouch on the foremost of them, bent forward and staring fixedly ahead, making uncouth and ghastly noises, till the climax was reached, when, turning a complete somersault, he would lie prostrate amidst the ruins of the chairs, apparently completely satisfied for the moment. As time passed, however, these painful seizures grew gradually less frequent, and his friends strove to divert his mind into fresh channels. But his interest in other matters did not seem to revive, and he grew apparently languid and depressed.

One fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to go on duty, went upstairs to relieve Badger, whom he found fidgeting to be off and stretch his legs in a long ramble round his wood and down his earths and burrows. "Toad's still in bed," he told the Rat, outside the door. "Can't get much out of him, except, 'O leave him alone, he wants nothing, perhaps he'll be better presently, it may pass off in time, don't be unduly anxious,' and so on. Now, you look out, Rat! When Toad's quiet and submissive and playing at being the hero of a Sunday-school prize, then he's at his artfullest. There's sure to be something up. I know him. Well, now, I must be off."

"How are you today, old chap?" inquired the Rat cheerfully, as he approached Toad's bedside.

He had to wait some minutes for an answer. At last a feeble voice replied, "Thank you so much, dear Ratty! So good of you to inquire! But first tell me how you are yourself, and the excellent Mole?"

"O, WE'RE all right," replied the Rat. "Mole," he added incautiously, "is going out for a run round with Badger. They'll be out till luncheon time, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together, and I'll do my best to amuse you. Now jump up, there's a good fellow, and don't lie moping there on a fine morning like this!"

"Dear, kind Rat," murmured Toad, "how little you realise my condition, and how very far I am from 'jumping up' now—if ever! But do not trouble about me. I hate being a burden to my friends, and I do not expect to be one much longer. Indeed, I almost hope not."

"Well, I hope not, too," said the Rat heartily. "You've been a fine bother to us all this time, and I'm glad to hear it's going to stop. And in weather like this, and the boating season just beginning! It's too bad of you, Toad! It isn't the trouble we mind, but you're making us miss such an awful lot."

"I'm afraid it IS the trouble you mind, though," replied the Toad languidly. "I can quite understand it. It's natural enough. You're tired of bothering about me. I mustn't ask you to do anything further. I'm a nuisance, I know."

"You are, indeed," said the Rat. "But I tell you, I'd take any trouble on earth for you, if only you'd be a sensible animal."

"If I thought that, Ratty," murmured Toad, more feebly than ever, "then I would beg you—for the last time, probably—to step round to the village as quickly as possible—even now it may be too late—and fetch the doctor. But don't you bother. It's only a trouble, and perhaps we may as well let things take their course."

"Why, what do you want a doctor for?" inquired the Rat, coming closer and examining him. He certainly lay very still and flat, and his voice was weaker and his manner much changed.

"Surely you have noticed of late—" murmured Toad. "But no—why should you? Noticing things is only a trouble. Tomorrow, indeed, you may be saying to yourself, 'O, if only I had noticed sooner! If only I had done something!' But no; it's a trouble. Never mind— forget that I asked."

"Look here, old man," said the Rat, beginning to get rather alarmed, "of course I'll fetch a doctor to you, if you really think you want him. But you can hardly be bad enough for that yet. Let's talk about something else."

"I fear, dear friend," said Toad, with a sad smile, "That 'talk' can do little in a case like this—or doctors either, for that matter; still, one must grasp at the slightest straw. And, by the way—while you are about it—I HATE to give you additional trouble, but I happen to remember that you will pass the door—would you mind at the same time asking the lawyer to step up? It would be a convenience to me, and there are moments—perhaps I should say there is A moment—when one must face disagreeable tasks, at whatever cost to exhausted nature!"

"A lawyer! O, he must be really bad!" the affrighted Rat said to himself, as he hurried from the room, not forgetting, however, to lock the door carefully behind him.

Outside, he stopped to consider. The other two were far away, and he had no one to consult.

"It's best to be on the safe side," he said, on reflection. "I've known Toad fancy himself frightfully bad before, without the slightest reason; but I've never heard him ask for a lawyer! If there's nothing really the matter, the doctor will tell him he's an old ass, and cheer him up; and that will be something gained. I'd better humour him and go; it won't take very long." So he ran off to the village on his errand of mercy.

The Toad, who had hopped lightly out of bed as soon as he heard the key turned in the lock, watched him eagerly from the window till he disappeared down the carriage-drive. Then, laughing heartily, he dressed as quickly as possible in the smartest suit he could lay hands on at the moment, filled his pockets with cash which he took from a small drawer in the dressing-table, and next, knotting the sheets from his bed together and tying one end of the improvised rope round the central mullion of the handsome Tudor window which formed such a feature of his bedroom, he scrambled out, slid lightly to the ground, and, taking the opposite direction to the Rat, marched off lightheartedly, whistling a merry tune.

It was a gloomy luncheon for Rat when the Badger and the Mole at length returned, and he had to face them at table with his pitiful and unconvincing story. The Badger's caustic, not to say brutal, remarks may be imagined, and therefore passed over; but it was painful to the Rat that even the Mole, though he took his friend's side as far as possible, could not help saying, "You've been a bit of a duffer this time, Ratty! Toad, too, of all animals!"

"He did it awfully well," said the crestfallen Rat.

"He did YOU awfully well!" rejoined the Badger hotly. "However, talking won't mend matters. He's got clear away for the time, that's certain; and the worst of it is, he'll be so conceited with what he'll think is his cleverness that he may commit any folly. One comfort is, we're free now, and needn't waste any more of our precious time doing sentry-go. But we'd better continue to sleep at Toad Hall for a while longer. Toad may be brought back at any moment—on a stretcher, or between two policemen."

So spoke the Badger, not knowing what the future held in store, or how much water, and of how turbid a character, was to run under bridges before Toad should sit at ease again in his ancestral Hall.





Meanwhile, Toad, gay and irresponsible, was walking briskly along the high road, some miles from home. At first he had taken bypaths, and crossed many fields, and changed his course several times, in case of pursuit; but now, feeling by this time safe from recapture, and the sun smiling brightly on him, and all Nature joining in a chorus of approval to the song of self-praise that his own heart was singing to him, he almost danced along the road in his satisfaction and conceit.

"Smart piece of work that!" he remarked to himself, chuckling. "Brain against brute force—and brain came out on the top—as it's bound to do. Poor old Ratty! My! won't he catch it when the Badger gets back! A worthy fellow, Ratty, with many good qualities, but very little intelligence and absolutely no education. I must take him in hand some day, and see if I can make something of him."

Filled full of conceited thoughts such as these he strode along, his head in the air, till he reached a little town, where the sign of "The Red Lion," swinging across the road half-way down the main street, reminded him that he had not breakfasted that day, and that he was exceedingly hungry after his long walk. He marched into the inn, ordered the best luncheon that could be provided at so short a notice, and sat down to eat it in the coffee-room.

He was about half-way through his meal when an only too familiar sound, approaching down the street, made him start and fall a-trembling all over. The poop-poop! drew nearer and nearer, the car could be heard to turn into the inn-yard and come to a stop, and Toad had to hold on to the leg of the table to conceal his over-mastering emotion. Presently the party entered the coffee-room, hungry, talkative, and gay, voluble on their experiences of the morning and the merits of the chariot that had brought them along so well. Toad listened eagerly, all ears, for a time; at last he could stand it no longer. He slipped out of the room quietly, paid his bill at the bar, and as soon as he got outside sauntered round quietly to the inn-yard. "There cannot be any harm," he said to himself, "in my only just LOOKING at it!"

The car stood in the middle of the yard, quite unattended, the stable-helps and other hangers-on being all at their dinner. Toad walked slowly round it, inspecting, criticising, musing deeply.

"I wonder," he said to himself presently, "I wonder if this sort of car STARTS easily?"

Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul. As if in a dream he found himself, somehow, seated in the driver's seat; as if in a dream, he pulled the lever and swung the car round the yard and out through the archway; and, as if in a dream, all sense of right and wrong, all fear of obvious consequences, seemed temporarily suspended. He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street and leapt forth on the high road through the open country, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest, Toad the terror, the traffic-queller, the Lord of the lone trail, before whom all must give way or be smitten into nothingness and everlasting night. He chanted as he flew, and the car responded with sonorous drone; the miles were eaten up under him as he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him.





"To my mind," observed the Chairman of the Bench of Magistrates cheerfully, "The ONLY difficulty that presents itself in this otherwise very clear case is, how we can possibly make it sufficiently hot for the incorrigible rogue and hardened ruffian whom we see cowering in the dock before us. Let me see: he has been found guilty, on the clearest evidence, first, of stealing a valuable motor-car; secondly, of driving to the public danger; and, thirdly, of gross impertinence to the rural police. Mr. Clerk, will you tell us, please, what is the very stiffest penalty we can impose for each of these offences? Without, of course, giving the prisoner the benefit of any doubt, because there isn't any."

The Clerk scratched his nose with his pen. "Some people would consider," he observed, "that stealing the motor-car was the worst offence; and so it is. But cheeking the police undoubtedly carries the severest penalty; and so it ought. Supposing you were to say twelve months for the theft, which is mild; and three years for the furious driving, which is lenient; and fifteen years for the cheek, which was pretty bad sort of cheek, judging by what we've heard from the witness-box, even if you only believe one-tenth part of what you heard, and I never believe more myself—those figures, if added together correctly, tot up to nineteen years—"

"First-rate!" said the Chairman.

"—So you had better make it a round twenty years and be on the safe side," concluded the Clerk.

"An excellent suggestion!" said the Chairman approvingly. "Prisoner! Pull yourself together and try and stand up straight. It's going to be twenty years for you this time. And mind, if you appear before us again, upon any charge whatever, we shall have to deal with you very seriously!"

Then the brutal minions of the law fell upon the hapless Toad; loaded him with chains, and dragged him from the Court House, shrieking, praying, protesting; across the marketplace, where the playful populace, always as severe upon detected crime as they are sympathetic and helpful when one is merely "wanted," assailed him with jeers, carrots, and popular catch-words; past hooting school children, their innocent faces lit up with the pleasure they ever derive from the sight of a gentleman in difficulties; across the hollow-sounding drawbridge, below the spiky portcullis, under the frowning archway of the grim old castle, whose ancient towers soared high overhead; past guardrooms full of grinning soldiery off duty, past sentries who coughed in a horrid sarcastic way, because that is as much as a sentry on his post dare do to show his contempt and abhorrence of crime; up time-worn winding stairs, past men-at-arms in casquet and corselet of steel, darting threatening looks through their vizards; across courtyards, where mastiffs strained at their leash and pawed the air to get at him; past ancient warders, their halberds leant against the wall, dozing over a pasty and a flagon of brown ale; on and on, past the rack-chamber and the thumb-screw-room, past the turning that led to the private scaffold, till they reached the door of the grimmest dungeon that lay in the heart of the innermost keep. There at last they paused, where an ancient gaoler sat fingering a bunch of mighty keys.

"Oddsbodikins!" said the sergeant of police, taking off his helmet and wiping his forehead. "Rouse thee, old loon, and take over from us this vile Toad, a criminal of deepest guilt and matchless artfulness and resource. Watch and ward him with all thy skill; and mark thee well, greybeard, should aught untoward befall, thy old head shall answer for his—and a murrain on both of them!"

The gaoler nodded grimly, laying his withered hand on the shoulder of the miserable Toad. The rusty key creaked in the lock, the great door clanged behind them; and Toad was a helpless prisoner in the remotest dungeon of the best-guarded keep of the stoutest castle in all the length and breadth of Merry England.





Chapter VII The Piper at the Gates of Dawn


The Willow-Wren was twittering his thin little song, hidden himself in the dark selvedge of the river bank. Though it was past ten o'clock at night, the sky still clung to and retained some lingering skirts of light from the departed day; and the sullen heats of the torrid afternoon broke up and rolled away at the dispersing touch of the cool fingers of the short midsummer night. Mole lay stretched on the bank, still panting from the stress of the fierce day that had been cloudless from dawn to late sunset, and waited for his friend to return. He had been on the river with some companions, leaving the Water Rat free to keep an engagement of long standing with Otter; and he had come back to find the house dark and deserted, and no sign of Rat, who was doubtless keeping it up late with his old comrade. It was still too hot to think of staying indoors, so he lay on some cool dock-leaves, and thought over the past day and its doings, and how very good they all had been.

The Rat's light footfall was presently heard approaching over the parched grass. "O, the blessed coolness!" he said, and sat down, gazing thoughtfully into the river, silent and preoccupied.

"You stayed to supper, of course?" said the Mole presently.

"Simply had to," said the Rat. "They wouldn't hear of my going before. You know how kind they always are. And they made things as jolly for me as ever they could, right up to the moment I left. But I felt a brute all the time, as it was clear to me they were very unhappy, though they tried to hide it. Mole, I'm afraid they're in trouble. Little Portly is missing again; and you know what a lot his father thinks of him, though he never says much about it."

"What, that child?" said the Mole lightly. "Well, suppose he is; why worry about it? He's always straying off and getting lost, and turning up again; he's so adventurous. But no harm ever happens to him. Everybody hereabouts knows him and likes him, just as they do old Otter, and you may be sure some animal or other will come across him and bring him back again all right. Why, we've found him ourselves, miles from home, and quite self-possessed and cheerful!"

"Yes; but this time it's more serious," said the Rat gravely. "He's been missing for some days now, and the Otters have hunted everywhere, high and low, without finding the slightest trace. And they've asked every animal, too, for miles around, and no one knows anything about him. Otter's evidently more anxious than he'll admit. I got out of him that young Portly hasn't learnt to swim very well yet, and I can see he's thinking of the weir. There's a lot of water coming down still, considering the time of the year, and the place always had a fascination for the child. And then there are—well, traps and things—YOU know. Otter's not the fellow to be nervous about any son of his before it's time. And now he IS nervous. When I left, he came out with me—said he wanted some air, and talked about stretching his legs. But I could see it wasn't that, so I drew him out and pumped him, and got it all from him at last. He was going to spend the night watching by the ford. You know the place where the old ford used to be, in bygone days before they built the bridge?"

"I know it well," said the Mole. "But why should Otter choose to watch there?"

"Well, it seems that it was there he gave Portly his first swimming-lesson," continued the Rat. "From that shallow, gravelly spit near the bank. And it was there he used to teach him fishing, and there young Portly caught his first fish, of which he was so very proud. The child loved the spot, and Otter thinks that if he came wandering back from wherever he is—if he IS anywhere by this time, poor little chap—he might make for the ford he was so fond of; or if he came across it he'd remember it well, and stop there and play, perhaps. So Otter goes there every night and watches—on the chance, you know, just on the chance!"

They were silent for a time, both thinking of the same thing—the lonely, heart-sore animal, crouched by the ford, watching and waiting, the long night through—on the chance.

"Well, well," said the Rat presently, "I suppose we ought to be thinking about turning in." But he never offered to move.

"Rat," said the Mole, "I simply can't go and turn in, and go to sleep, and DO nothing, even though there doesn't seem to be anything to be done. We'll get the boat out, and paddle upstream. The moon will be up in an hour or so, and then we will search as well as we can—anyhow, it will be better than going to bed and doing NOTHING."

"Just what I was thinking myself," said the Rat. "It's not the sort of night for bed anyhow; and day-break is not so very far off, and then we may pick up some news of him from early risers as we go along."

They got the boat out, and the Rat took the sculls, paddling with caution. Out in mid-stream, there was a clear, narrow track that faintly reflected the sky; but wherever shadows fell on the water from bank, bush, or tree, they were as solid to all appearance as the banks themselves, and the Mole had to steer with judgment accordingly. Dark and deserted as it was, the night was full of small noises, song and chatter and rustling, telling of the busy little population who were up and about, plying their trades and vocations through the night till sunshine should fall on them at last and send them off to their well-earned repose. The water's own noises, too, were more apparent than by day, its gurglings and "cloops" more unexpected and near at hand; and constantly they started at what seemed a sudden clear call from an actual articulate voice.

The line of the horizon was clear and hard against the sky, and in one particular quarter it showed black against a silvery climbing phosphorescence that grew and grew. At last, over the rim of the waiting earth the moon lifted with slow majesty till it swung clear of the horizon and rode off, free of moorings; and once more they began to see surfaces—meadows widespread, and quiet gardens, and the river itself from bank to bank, all softly disclosed, all washed clean of mystery and terror, all radiant again as by day, but with a difference that was tremendous. Their old haunts greeted them again in other raiment, as if they had slipped away and put on this pure new apparel and come quietly back, smiling as they shyly waited to see if they would be recognised again under it.

Fastening their boat to a willow, the friends landed in this silent, silver kingdom, and patiently explored the hedges, the hollow trees, the runnels and their little culverts, the ditches and dry waterways. Embarking again and crossing over, they worked their way up the stream in this manner, while the moon, serene and detached in a cloudless sky, did what she could, though so far off, to help them in their quest; till her hour came and she sank earthwards reluctantly, and left them, and mystery once more held field and river.

Then a change began slowly to declare itself. The horizon became clearer, field and tree came more into sight, and somehow with a different look; the mystery began to drop away from them. A bird piped suddenly, and was still; and a light breeze sprang up and set the reeds and bulrushes rustling. Rat, who was in the stern of the boat, while Mole sculled, sat up suddenly and listened with a passionate intentness. Mole, who with gentle strokes was just keeping the boat moving while he scanned the banks with care, looked at him with curiosity.

"It's gone!" sighed the Rat, sinking back in his seat again. "So beautiful and strange and new! Since it was to end so soon, I almost wish I had never heard it. For it has roused a longing in me that is pain, and nothing seems worth while but just to hear that sound once more and go on listening to it for ever. No! There it is again!" he cried, alert once more. Entranced, he was silent for a long space, spellbound.

"Now it passes on and I begin to lose it," he said presently. "O Mole! the beauty of it! The merry bubble and joy, the thin, clear, happy call of the distant piping! Such music I never dreamed of, and the call in it is stronger even than the music is sweet! Row on, Mole, row! For the music and the call must be for us."

The Mole, greatly wondering, obeyed. "I hear nothing myself," he said, "but the wind playing in the reeds and rushes and osiers."

The Rat never answered, if indeed he heard. Rapt, transported, trembling, he was possessed in all his senses by this new divine thing that caught up his helpless soul and swung and dandled it, a powerless but happy infant, in a strong sustaining grasp.

In silence Mole rowed steadily, and soon they came to a point where the river divided, a long backwater branching off to one side. With a slight movement of his head Rat, who had long dropped the rudder-lines, directed the rower to take the backwater. The creeping tide of light gained and gained, and now they could see the colour of the flowers that gemmed the water's edge.

"Clearer and nearer still," cried the Rat joyously. "Now you must surely hear it! Ah—at last—I see you do!"

Breathless and transfixed the Mole stopped rowing as the liquid run of that glad piping broke on him like a wave, caught him up, and possessed him utterly. He saw the tears on his comrade's cheeks, and bowed his head and understood. For a space they hung there, brushed by the purple loosestrife that fringed the bank; then the clear imperious summons that marched hand-in-hand with the intoxicating melody imposed its will on Mole, and mechanically he bent to his oars again. And the light grew steadily stronger, but no birds sang as they were wont to do at the approach of dawn; and but for the heavenly music all was marvellously still.

On either side of them, as they glided onwards, the rich meadow-grass seemed that morning of a freshness and a greenness unsurpassable. Never had they noticed the roses so vivid, the willow-herb so riotous, the meadowsweet so odorous and pervading. Then the murmur of the approaching weir began to hold the air, and they felt a consciousness that they were nearing the end, whatever it might be, that surely awaited their expedition.

A wide half-circle of foam and glinting lights and shining shoulders of green water, the great weir closed the backwater from bank to bank, troubled all the quiet surface with twirling eddies and floating foam-streaks, and deadened all other sounds with its solemn and soothing rumble. In midmost of the stream, embraced in the weir's shimmering arm-spread, a small island lay anchored, fringed close with willow and silver birch and alder. Reserved, shy, but full of significance, it hid whatever it might hold behind a veil, keeping it till the hour should come, and, with the hour, those who were called and chosen.

Slowly, but with no doubt or hesitation whatever, and in something of a solemn expectancy, the two animals passed through the broken, tumultuous water and moored their boat at the flowery margin of the island. In silence they landed, and pushed through the blossom and scented herbage and undergrowth that led up to the level ground, till they stood on a little lawn of a marvellous green, set round with Nature's own orchard-trees—crabapple, wild cherry, and sloe.

"This is the place of my song-dream, the place the music played to me," whispered the Rat, as if in a trance. "Here, in this holy place, here if anywhere, surely we shall find Him!"

Then suddenly the Mole felt a great Awe fall upon him, an awe that turned his muscles to water, bowed his head, and rooted his feet to the ground. It was no panic terror—indeed he felt wonderfully at peace and happy—but it was an awe that smote and held him and, without seeing, he knew it could only mean that some august Presence was very, very near. With difficulty he turned to look for his friend, and saw him at his side cowed, stricken, and trembling violently. And still there was utter silence in the populous bird-haunted branches around them; and still the light grew and grew.

Perhaps he would never have dared to raise his eyes, but that, though the piping was now hushed, the call and the summons seemed still dominant and imperious. He might not refuse, were Death himself waiting to strike him instantly, once he had looked with mortal eye on things rightly kept hidden. Trembling he obeyed, and raised his humble head; and then, in that utter clearness of the imminent dawn, while Nature, flushed with fullness of incredible colour, seemed to hold her breath for the event, he looked in the very eyes of the Friend and Helper; saw the backward sweep of the curved horns, gleaming in the growing daylight; saw the stern, hooked nose between the kindly eyes that were looking down on them humourously, while the bearded mouth broke into a half-smile at the corners; saw the rippling muscles on the arm that lay across the broad chest, the long supple hand still holding the pan-pipes only just fallen away from the parted lips; saw the splendid curves of the shaggy limbs disposed in majestic ease on the sward; saw, last of all, nestling between his very hooves, sleeping soundly in entire peace and contentment, the little, round, podgy, childish form of the baby otter. All this he saw, for one moment breathless and intense, vivid on the morning sky; and still, as he looked, he lived; and still, as he lived, he wondered.

"Rat!" he found breath to whisper, shaking. "Are you afraid?"

"Afraid?" murmured the Rat, his eyes shining with unutterable love. "Afraid! Of HIM? O, never, never! And yet—and yet—O, Mole, I am afraid!"

Then the two animals, crouching to the earth, bowed their heads and did worship.

Sudden and magnificent, the sun's broad golden disc showed itself over the horizon facing them; and the first rays, shooting across the level water-meadows, took the animals full in the eyes and dazzled them. When they were able to look once more, the Vision had vanished, and the air was full of the carol of birds that hailed the dawn.

As they stared blankly, in dumb misery deepening as they slowly realised all they had seen and all they had lost, a capricious little breeze, dancing up from the surface of the water, tossed the aspens, shook the dewy roses, and blew lightly and caressingly in their faces, and with its soft touch came instant oblivion. For this is the last best gift that the kindly demi-god is careful to bestow on those to whom he has revealed himself in their helping: the gift of forgetfulness. Lest the awful remembrance should remain and grow, and overshadow mirth and pleasure, and the great haunting memory should spoil all the after-lives of little animals helped out of difficulties, in order that they should be happy and light-hearted as before.

Mole rubbed his eyes and stared at Rat, who was looking about him in a puzzled sort of way. "I beg your pardon; what did you say, Rat?" he asked.

"I think I was only remarking," said Rat slowly, "that this was the right sort of place, and that here, if anywhere, we should find him. And look! Why, there he is, the little fellow!" And with a cry of delight he ran towards the slumbering Portly.

But Mole stood still a moment, held in thought. As one wakened suddenly from a beautiful dream, who struggles to recall it, and can recapture nothing but a dim sense of the beauty of it, the beauty! Till that, too, fades away in its turn, and the dreamer bitterly accepts the hard, cold waking and all its penalties; so Mole, after struggling with his memory for a brief space, shook his head sadly and followed the Rat.

Portly woke up with a joyous squeak, and wriggled with pleasure at the sight of his father's friends, who had played with him so often in past days. In a moment, however, his face grew blank, and he fell to hunting round in a circle with pleading whine. As a child that has fallen happily asleep in its nurse's arms, and wakes to find itself alone and laid in a strange place, and searches corners and cupboards, and runs from room to room, despair growing silently in its heart, even so Portly searched the island and searched, dogged and unwearying, till at last the black moment came for giving it up, and sitting down and crying bitterly.

The Mole ran quickly to comfort the little animal; but Rat, lingering, looked long and doubtfully at certain hoof-marks deep in the sward.

"Some—great—animal—has been here," he murmured slowly and thoughtfully; and stood musing, musing; his mind strangely stirred.

"Come along, Rat!" called the Mole. "Think of poor Otter, waiting up there by the ford!"

Portly had soon been comforted by the promise of a treat—a jaunt on the river in Mr. Rat's real boat; and the two animals conducted him to the water's side, placed him securely between them in the bottom of the boat, and paddled off down the backwater. The sun was fully up by now, and hot on them, birds sang lustily and without restraint, and flowers smiled and nodded from either bank, but somehow—so thought the animals—with less of richness and blaze of colour than they seemed to remember seeing quite recently somewhere—they wondered where.

The main river reached again, they turned the boat's head upstream, towards the point where they knew their friend was keeping his lonely vigil. As they drew near the familiar ford, the Mole took the boat in to the bank, and they lifted Portly out and set him on his legs on the tow-path, gave him his marching orders and a friendly farewell pat on the back, and shoved out into mid-stream. They watched the little animal as he waddled along the path contentedly and with importance; watched him till they saw his muzzle suddenly lift and his waddle break into a clumsy amble as he quickened his pace with shrill whines and wriggles of recognition. Looking up the river, they could see Otter start up, tense and rigid, from out of the shallows where he crouched in dumb patience, and could hear his amazed and joyous bark as he bounded up through the osiers on to the path. Then the Mole, with a strong pull on one oar, swung the boat round and let the full stream bear them down again whither it would, their quest now happily ended.

"I feel strangely tired, Rat," said the Mole, leaning wearily over his oars as the boat drifted. "It's being up all night, you'll say, perhaps; but that's nothing. We do as much half the nights of the week, at this time of the year. No; I feel as if I had been through something very exciting and rather terrible, and it was just over; and yet nothing particular has happened."

"Or something very surprising and splendid and beautiful," murmured the Rat, leaning back and closing his eyes. "I feel just as you do, Mole; simply dead tired, though not body-tired. It's lucky we've got the stream with us, to take us home. Isn't it jolly to feel the sun again, soaking into one's bones! And hark to the wind playing in the reeds!"

"It's like music—far-away music," said the Mole nodding drowsily.

"So I was thinking," murmured the Rat, dreamful and languid. "Dance-music—the lilting sort that runs on without a stop—but with words in it, too—it passes into words and out of them again—I catch them at intervals—then it is dance-music once more, and then nothing but the reeds' soft thin whispering."

"You hear better than I," said the Mole sadly. "I cannot catch the words."

"Let me try and give you them," said the Rat softly, his eyes still closed. "Now it is turning into words again—faint but clear—Lest the awe should dwell—And turn your frolic to fret—You shall look on my power at the helping hour—But then you shall forget! Now the reeds take it up—forget, forget, they sigh, and it dies away in a rustle and a whisper. Then the voice returns—

"Lest limbs be reddened and rent—I spring the trap that is set—As I loose the snare you may glimpse me there—For surely you shall forget! Row nearer, Mole, nearer to the reeds! It is hard to catch, and grows each minute fainter.

"Helper and healer, I cheer—Small waifs in the woodland wet—Strays I find in it, wounds I bind in it—Bidding them all forget! Nearer, Mole, nearer! No, it is no good; the song has died away into reed-talk."

"But what do the words mean?" asked the wondering Mole.

"That I do not know," said the Rat simply. "I passed them on to you as they reached me. Ah! now they return again, and this time full and clear! This time, at last, it is the real, the unmistakable thing, simple—passionate—perfect—"

"Well, let's have it, then," said the Mole, after he had waited patiently for a few minutes, half dozing in the hot sun.

But no answer came. He looked, and understood the silence. With a smile of much happiness on his face, and something of a listening look still lingering there, the weary Rat was fast asleep.





Chapter VIII Toad's Adventures


When Toad found himself immured in a dank and noisome dungeon, and knew that all the grim darkness of a medieval fortress lay between him and the outer world of sunshine and well-metalled high roads where he had lately been so happy, disporting himself as if he had bought up every road in England, he flung himself at full length on the floor, and shed bitter tears, and abandoned himself to dark despair. "This is the end of everything" (he said), "at least it is the end of the career of Toad, which is the same thing; the popular and handsome Toad, the rich and hospitable Toad, the Toad so free and careless and debonair! How can I hope to be ever set at large again" (he said), "who have been imprisoned so justly for stealing so handsome a motor-car in such an audacious manner, and for such lurid and imaginative cheek, bestowed upon such a number of fat, red-faced policemen!" (Here his sobs choked him.) "Stupid animal that I was" (he said), "now I must languish in this dungeon, till people who were proud to say they knew me, have forgotten the very name of Toad! O wise old Badger!" (he said), "O clever, intelligent Rat and sensible Mole! What sound judgments, what a knowledge of men and matters you possess! O unhappy and forsaken Toad!" With lamentations such as these he passed his days and nights for several weeks, refusing his meals or intermediate light refreshments, though the grim and ancient gaoler, knowing that Toad's pockets were well lined, frequently pointed out that many comforts, and indeed luxuries, could by arrangement be sent in—at a price—from outside.

Now the gaoler had a daughter, a pleasant wench and good-hearted, who assisted her father in the lighter duties of his post. She was particularly fond of animals, and, besides her canary, whose cage hung on a nail in the massive wall of the keep by day, to the great annoyance of prisoners who relished an after-dinner nap, and was shrouded in an antimacassar on the parlour table at night, she kept several piebald mice and a restless revolving squirrel. This kind-hearted girl, pitying the misery of Toad, said to her father one day, "Father! I can't bear to see that poor beast so unhappy, and getting so thin! You let me have the managing of him. You know how fond of animals I am. I'll make him eat from my hand, and sit up, and do all sorts of things."

Her father replied that she could do what she liked with him. He was tired of Toad, and his sulks and his airs and his meanness. So that day she went on her errand of mercy, and knocked at the door of Toad's cell.

"Now, cheer up, Toad," she said coaxingly, on entering, "and sit up and dry your eyes and be a sensible animal. And do try and eat a bit of dinner. See, I've brought you some of mine, hot from the oven!"

It was bubble-and-squeak, between two plates, and its fragrance filled the narrow cell. The penetrating smell of cabbage reached the nose of Toad as he lay prostrate in his misery on the floor, and gave him the idea for a moment that perhaps life was not such a blank and desperate thing as he had imagined. But still he wailed, and kicked with his legs, and refused to be comforted. So the wise girl retired for the time, but, of course, a good deal of the smell of hot cabbage remained behind, as it will do, and Toad, between his sobs, sniffed and reflected, and gradually began to think new and inspiring thoughts: of chivalry, and poetry, and deeds still to be done; of broad meadows, and cattle browsing in them, raked by sun and wind; of kitchen-gardens, and straight herb-borders, and warm snap-dragon beset by bees; and of the comforting clink of dishes set down on the table at Toad Hall, and the scrape of chair-legs on the floor as every one pulled himself close up to his work. The air of the narrow cell took a rosy tinge; he began to think of his friends, and how they would surely be able to do something; of lawyers, and how they would have enjoyed his case, and what an ass he had been not to get in a few; and lastly, he thought of his own great cleverness and resource, and all that he was capable of if he only gave his great mind to it; and the cure was almost complete.

When the girl returned, some hours later, she carried a tray, with a cup of fragrant tea steaming on it; and a plate piled up with very hot buttered toast, cut thick, very brown on both sides, with the butter running through the holes in it in great golden drops, like honey from the honeycomb. The smell of that buttered toast simply talked to Toad, and with no uncertain voice; talked of warm kitchens, of breakfasts on bright frosty mornings, of cosy parlour firesides on winter evenings, when one's ramble was over and slippered feet were propped on the fender; of the purring of contented cats, and the twitter of sleepy canaries. Toad sat up on end once more, dried his eyes, sipped his tea and munched his toast, and soon began talking freely about himself, and the house he lived in, and his doings there, and how important he was, and what a lot his friends thought of him.

The gaoler's daughter saw that the topic was doing him as much good as the tea, as indeed it was, and encouraged him to go on.

"Tell me about Toad Hall," said she. "It sounds beautiful."

"Toad Hall," said the Toad proudly, "is an eligible self-contained gentleman's residence, very unique; dating in part from the fourteenth century, but replete with every modern convenience. Up-to-date sanitation. Five minutes from church, post-office, and golf-links, Suitable for—"

"Bless the animal," said the girl, laughing, "I don't want to TAKE it. Tell me something REAL about it. But first wait till I fetch you some more tea and toast."

She tripped away, and presently returned with a fresh trayful; and Toad, pitching into the toast with avidity, his spirits quite restored to their usual level, told her about the boat-house, and the fish-pond, and the old walled kitchen-garden; and about the pig-styes, and the stables, and the pigeon-house, and the hen-house; and about the dairy, and the wash-house, and the china-cupboards, and the linen-presses (she liked that bit especially); and about the banqueting-hall, and the fun they had there when the other animals were gathered round the table and Toad was at his best, singing songs, telling stories, carrying on generally. Then she wanted to know about his animal-friends, and was very interested in all he had to tell her about them and how they lived, and what they did to pass their time. Of course, she did not say she was fond of animals as PETS, because she had the sense to see that Toad would be extremely offended. When she said good night, having filled his water-jug and shaken up his straw for him, Toad was very much the same sanguine, self-satisfied animal that he had been of old. He sang a little song or two, of the sort he used to sing at his dinner-parties, curled himself up in the straw, and had an excellent night's rest and the pleasantest of dreams.

They had many interesting talks together, after that, as the dreary days went on; and the gaoler's daughter grew very sorry for Toad, and thought it a great shame that a poor little animal should be locked up in prison for what seemed to her a very trivial offence. Toad, of course, in his vanity, thought that her interest in him proceeded from a growing tenderness; and he could not help half regretting that the social gulf between them was so very wide, for she was a comely lass, and evidently admired him very much.

One morning the girl was very thoughtful, and answered at random, and did not seem to Toad to be paying proper attention to his witty sayings and sparkling comments.

"Toad," she said presently, "just listen, please. I have an aunt who is a washerwoman."

"There, there," said Toad, graciously and affably, "never mind; think no more about it. I have several aunts who OUGHT to be washerwomen."

"Do be quiet a minute, Toad," said the girl. "You talk too much, that's your chief fault, and I'm trying to think, and you hurt my head. As I said, I have an aunt who is a washerwoman; she does the washing for all the prisoners in this castle—we try to keep any paying business of that sort in the family, you understand. She takes out the washing on Monday morning, and brings it in on Friday evening. This is a Thursday. Now, this is what occurs to me: you're very rich—at least you're always telling me so—and she's very poor. A few pounds wouldn't make any difference to you, and it would mean a lot to her. Now, I think if she were properly approached— squared, I believe is the word you animals use—you could come to some arrangement by which she would let you have her dress and bonnet and so on, and you could escape from the castle as the official washerwoman. You're very alike in many respects—particularly about the figure."

"We're NOT," said the Toad in a huff. "I have a very elegant figure—for what I am."

"So has my aunt," replied the girl, "for what SHE is. But have it your own way. You horrid, proud, ungrateful animal, when I'm sorry for you, and trying to help you!"

"Yes, yes, that's all right; thank you very much indeed," said the Toad hurriedly. "But look here! you wouldn't surely have Mr. Toad of Toad Hall, going about the country disguised as a washerwoman!"

"Then you can stop here as a Toad," replied the girl with much spirit. "I suppose you want to go off in a coach-and-four!"

Honest Toad was always ready to admit himself in the wrong. "You are a good, kind, clever girl," he said, "and I am indeed a proud and a stupid toad. Introduce me to your worthy aunt, if you will be so kind, and I have no doubt that the excellent lady and I will be able to arrange terms satisfactory to both parties."

Next evening the girl ushered her aunt into Toad's cell, bearing his week's washing pinned up in a towel. The old lady had been prepared beforehand for the interview, and the sight of certain gold sovereigns that Toad had thoughtfully placed on the table in full view practically completed the matter and left little further to discuss. In return for his cash, Toad received a cotton print gown, an apron, a shawl, and a rusty black bonnet; the only stipulation the old lady made being that she should be gagged and bound and dumped down in a corner. By this not very convincing artifice, she explained, aided by picturesque fiction which she could supply herself, she hoped to retain her situation, in spite of the suspicious appearance of things.

Toad was delighted with the suggestion. It would enable him to leave the prison in some style, and with his reputation for being a desperate and dangerous fellow untarnished; and he readily helped the gaoler's daughter to make her aunt appear as much as possible the victim of circumstances over which she had no control.

"Now it's your turn, Toad," said the girl. "Take off that coat and waistcoat of yours; you're fat enough as it is."

Shaking with laughter, she proceeded to "hook-and-eye" him into the cotton print gown, arranged the shawl with a professional fold, and tied the strings of the rusty bonnet under his chin.

"You're the very image of her," she giggled, "only I'm sure you never looked half so respectable in all your life before. Now, good-bye, Toad, and good luck. Go straight down the way you came up; and if any one says anything to you, as they probably will, being but men, you can chaff back a bit, of course, but remember you're a widow woman, quite alone in the world, with a character to lose."

With a quaking heart, but as firm a footstep as he could command, Toad set forth cautiously on what seemed to be a most hare-brained and hazardous undertaking; but he was soon agreeably surprised to find how easy everything was made for him, and a little humbled at the thought that both his popularity, and the sex that seemed to inspire it, were really another's. The washerwoman's squat figure in its familiar cotton print seemed a passport for every barred door and grim gateway; even when he hesitated, uncertain as to the right turning to take, he found himself helped out of his difficulty by the warder at the next gate, anxious to be off to his tea, summoning him to come along sharp and not keep him waiting there all night. The chaff and the humourous sallies to which he was subjected, and to which, of course, he had to provide prompt and effective reply, formed, indeed, his chief danger; for Toad was an animal with a strong sense of his own dignity, and the chaff was mostly (he thought) poor and clumsy, and the humour of the sallies entirely lacking. However, he kept his temper, though with great difficulty, suited his retorts to his company and his supposed character, and did his best not to overstep the limits of good taste.

It seemed hours before he crossed the last courtyard, rejected the pressing invitations from the last guardroom, and dodged the outspread arms of the last warder, pleading with simulated passion for just one farewell embrace. But at last he heard the wicket-gate in the great outer door click behind him, felt the fresh air of the outer world upon his anxious brow, and knew that he was free!

Dizzy with the easy success of his daring exploit, he walked quickly towards the lights of the town, not knowing in the least what he should do next, only quite certain of one thing, that he must remove himself as quickly as possible from the neighbourhood where the lady he was forced to represent was so well-known and so popular a character.

As he walked along, considering, his attention was caught by some red and green lights a little way off, to one side of the town, and the sound of the puffing and snorting of engines and the banging of shunted trucks fell on his ear. "Aha!" he thought, "this is a piece of luck! A railway station is the thing I want most in the whole world at this moment; and what's more, I needn't go through the town to get it, and shan't have to support this humiliating character by repartees which, though thoroughly effective, do not assist one's sense of self-respect."

He made his way to the station accordingly, consulted a time-table, and found that a train, bound more or less in the direction of his home, was due to start in half an hour. "More luck!" said Toad, his spirits rising rapidly, and went off to the booking-office to buy his ticket.

He gave the name of the station that he knew to be nearest to the village of which Toad Hall was the principal feature, and mechanically put his fingers, in search of the necessary money, where his waistcoat pocket should have been. But here the cotton gown, which had nobly stood by him so far, and which he had basely forgotten, intervened, and frustrated his efforts. In a sort of nightmare he struggled with the strange uncanny thing that seemed to hold his hands, turn all muscular strivings to water, and laugh at him all the time; while other travellers, forming up in a line behind, waited with impatience, making suggestions of more or less value and comments of more or less stringency and point. At last—somehow—he never rightly understood how—he burst the barriers, attained the goal, arrived at where all waistcoat pockets are eternally situated, and found—not only no money, but no pocket to hold it, and no waistcoat to hold the pocket!

To his horror he recollected that he had left both coat and waistcoat behind him in his cell, and with them his pocket-book, money, keys, watch, matches, pencil-case—all that makes life worth living, all that distinguishes the many-pocketed animal, the lord of creation, from the inferior one-pocketed or no-pocketed productions that hop or trip about permissively, unequipped for the real contest.

In his misery he made one desperate effort to carry the thing off, and, with a return to his fine old manner—a blend of the Squire and the College Don—he said, "Look here! I find I've left my purse behind. Just give me that ticket, will you, and I'll send the money on tomorrow? I'm well known in these parts."

The clerk stared at him and the rusty black bonnet a moment, and then laughed. "I should think you were pretty well known in these parts," he said, "if you've tried this game on often. Here, stand away from the window, please, madam; you're obstructing the other passengers!"

An old gentleman who had been prodding him in the back for some moments here thrust him away, and, what was worse, addressed him as his good woman, which angered Toad more than anything that had occurred that evening.

Baffled and full of despair, he wandered blindly down the platform where the train was standing, and tears trickled down each side of his nose. It was hard, he thought, to be within sight of safety and almost of home, and to be baulked by the want of a few wretched shillings and by the pettifogging mistrustfulness of paid officials. Very soon his escape would be discovered, the hunt would be up, he would be caught, reviled, loaded with chains, dragged back again to prison and bread-and-water and straw; his guards and penalties would be doubled; and O, what sarcastic remarks the girl would make! What was to be done? He was not swift of foot; his figure was unfortunately recognisable. Could he not squeeze under the seat of a carriage? He had seen this method adopted by schoolboys, when the journey-money provided by thoughtful parents had been diverted to other and better ends. As he pondered, he found himself opposite the engine, which was being oiled, wiped, and generally caressed by its affectionate driver, a burly man with an oil-can in one hand and a lump of cottonwaste in the other.

"Hullo, mother!" said the engine-driver, "What's the trouble? You don't look particularly cheerful."

"O, sir!" said Toad, crying afresh, "I am a poor unhappy washerwoman, and I've lost all my money, and can't pay for a ticket, and I MUST get home tonight somehow, and whatever I am to do I don't know. O dear, O dear!"

"That's a bad business, indeed," said the engine-driver reflectively. "Lost your money—and can't get home—and got some kids, too, waiting for you, I dare say?"

"Any amount of 'em," sobbed Toad. "And they'll be hungry—and playing with matches—and upsetting lamps, the little innocents!—and quarrelling, and going on generally. O dear, O dear!"

"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do," said the good engine-driver. "You're a washerwoman to your trade, says you. Very well, that's that. And I'm an engine-driver, as you well may see, and there's no denying it's terribly dirty work. Uses up a power of shirts, it does, till my missus is fair tired of washing of 'em. If you'll wash a few shirts for me when you get home, and send 'em along, I'll give you a ride on my engine. It's against the Company's regulations, but we're not so very particular in these out-of-the-way parts."

The Toad's misery turned into rapture as he eagerly scrambled up into the cab of the engine. Of course, he had never washed a shirt in his life, and couldn't if he tried and, anyhow, he wasn't going to begin; but he thought: "When I get safely home to Toad Hall, and have money again, and pockets to put it in, I will send the engine-driver enough to pay for quite a quantity of washing, and that will be the same thing, or better."

The guard waved his welcome flag, the engine-driver whistled in cheerful response, and the train moved out of the station. As the speed increased, and the Toad could see on either side of him real fields and trees, and hedges, and cows, and horses, all flying past him, and as he thought how every minute was bringing him nearer to Toad Hall, and sympathetic friends, and money to chink in his pocket, and a soft bed to sleep in, and good things to eat, and praise and admiration at the recital of his adventures and his surpassing cleverness, he began to skip up and down and shout and sing snatches of song, to the great astonishment of the engine-driver, who had come across washerwomen before, at long intervals, but never one at all like this.

They had covered many and many a mile, and Toad was already considering what he would have for supper as soon as he got home, when he noticed that the engine-driver, with a puzzled expression on his face, was leaning over the side of the engine and listening hard. Then he saw him climb on to the coals and gaze out over the top of the train; then he returned and said to Toad: "It's very strange; we're the last train running in this direction tonight, yet I could be sworn that I heard another following us!"

Toad ceased his frivolous antics at once. He became grave and depressed, and a dull pain in the lower part of his spine, communicating itself to his legs, made him want to sit down and try desperately not to think of all the possibilities.

By this time the moon was shining brightly, and the engine-driver, steadying himself on the coal, could command a view of the line behind them for a long distance.

Presently he called out, "I can see it clearly now! It is an engine, on our rails, coming along at a great pace! It looks as if we were being pursued!"

The miserable Toad, crouching in the coal-dust, tried hard to think of something to do, with dismal want of success.

"They are gaining on us fast!" cried the engine-driver. "And the engine is crowded with the queerest lot of people! Men like ancient warders, waving halberds; policemen in their helmets, waving truncheons; and shabbily dressed men in pot-hats, obvious and unmistakable plain-clothes detectives even at this distance, waving revolvers and walking-sticks; all waving, and all shouting the same thing—'Stop, stop, stop!'"

Then Toad fell on his knees among the coals and, raising his clasped paws in supplication, cried, "Save me, only save me, dear kind Mr. Engine-driver, and I will confess everything! I am not the simple washerwoman I seem to be! I have no children waiting for me, innocent or otherwise! I am a toad—the well-known and popular Mr. Toad, a landed proprietor; I have just escaped, by my great daring and cleverness, from a loathsome dungeon into which my enemies had flung me; and if those fellows on that engine recapture me, it will be chains and bread-and-water and straw and misery once more for poor, unhappy, innocent Toad!"

The engine-driver looked down upon him very sternly, and said, "Now tell the truth; what were you put in prison for?"

"It was nothing very much," said poor Toad, colouring deeply. "I only borrowed a motor-car while the owners were at lunch; they had no need of it at the time. I didn't mean to steal it, really; but people—especially magistrates—take such harsh views of thoughtless and high-spirited actions."

The engine-driver looked very grave and said, "I fear that you have been indeed a wicked toad, and by rights I ought to give you up to offended justice. But you are evidently in sore trouble and distress, so I will not desert you. I don't hold with motor-cars, for one thing; and I don't hold with being ordered about by policemen when I'm on my own engine, for another. And the sight of an animal in tears always makes me feel queer and softhearted. So cheer up, Toad! I'll do my best, and we may beat them yet!"

They piled on more coals, shovelling furiously; the furnace roared, the sparks flew, the engine leapt and swung, but still their pursuers slowly gained. The engine-driver, with a sigh, wiped his brow with a handful of cottonwaste, and said, "I'm afraid it's no good, Toad. You see, they are running light, and they have the better engine. There's just one thing left for us to do, and it's your only chance, so attend very carefully to what I tell you. A short way ahead of us is a long tunnel, and on the other side of that the line passes through a thick wood. Now, I will put on all the speed I can while we are running through the tunnel, but the other fellows will slow down a bit, naturally, for fear of an accident. When we are through, I will shut off steam and put on brakes as hard as I can, and the moment it's safe to do so you must jump and hide in the wood, before they get through the tunnel and see you. Then I will go full speed ahead again, and they can chase ME if they like, for as long as they like, and as far as they like. Now mind and be ready to jump when I tell you!"

They piled on more coals, and the train shot into the tunnel, and the engine rushed and roared and rattled, till at last they shot out at the other end into fresh air and the peaceful moonlight, and saw the wood lying dark and helpful upon either side of the line. The driver shut off steam and put on brakes, the Toad got down on the step, and as the train slowed down to almost a walking pace he heard the driver call out, "Now, jump!"

Toad jumped, rolled down a short embankment, picked himself up unhurt, scrambled into the wood and hid.

Peeping out, he saw his train get up speed again and disappear at a great pace. Then out of the tunnel burst the pursuing engine, roaring and whistling, her motley crew waving their various weapons and shouting, "Stop! stop! stop!" When they were past, the Toad had a hearty laugh—for the first time since he was thrown into prison.

But he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now very late and dark and cold, and he was in an unknown wood, with no money and no chance of supper, and still far from friends and home; and the dead silence of everything, after the roar and rattle of the train, was something of a shock. He dared not leave the shelter of the trees, so he struck into the wood, with the idea of leaving the railway as far as possible behind him.

After so many weeks within walls, he found the wood strange and unfriendly and inclined, he thought, to make fun of him. Night-jars, sounding their mechanical rattle, made him think that the wood was full of searching warders, closing in on him. An owl, swooping noiselessly towards him, brushed his shoulder with its wing, making him jump with the horrid certainty that it was a hand; then flitted off, moth-like, laughing its low ho! ho! ho! which Toad thought in very poor taste. Once he met a fox, who stopped, looked him up and down in a sarcastic sort of way, and said, "Hullo, washerwoman! Half a pair of socks and a pillow-case short this week! Mind it doesn't occur again!" and swaggered off, sniggering. Toad looked about for a stone to throw at him, but could not succeed in finding one, which vexed him more than anything. At last, cold, hungry, and tired out, he sought the shelter of a hollow tree, where with branches and dead leaves he made himself as comfortable a bed as he could, and slept soundly till the morning.





Chapter IX Wayfarers All


The Water Rat was restless, and he did not exactly know why. To all appearance the summer's pomp was still at fullest height, and although in the tilled acres green had given way to gold, though rowans were reddening, and the woods were dashed here and there with a tawny fierceness, yet light and warmth and colour were still present in undiminished measure, clean of any chilly premonitions of the passing year. But the constant chorus of the orchards and hedges had shrunk to a casual evensong from a few yet unwearied performers; the robin was beginning to assert himself once more; and there was a feeling in the air of change and departure. The cuckoo, of course, had long been silent; but many another feathered friend, for months a part of the familiar landscape and its small society, was missing too, and it seemed that the ranks thinned steadily day by day. Rat, ever observant of all winged movement, saw that it was taking daily a southing tendency; and even as he lay in bed at night he thought he could make out, passing in the darkness overhead, the beat and quiver of impatient pinions, obedient to the peremptory call.

Nature's Grand Hotel has its Season, like the others. As the guests one by one pack, pay, and depart, and the seats at the table-d'hôte shrink pitifully at each succeeding meal; as suites of rooms are closed, carpets taken up, and waiters sent away; those boarders who are staying on, en pension, until the next year's full reopening, cannot help being somewhat affected by all these flittings and farewells, this eager discussion of plans, routes, and fresh quarters, this daily shrinkage in the stream of comradeship. One gets unsettled, depressed, and inclined to be querulous. Why this craving for change? Why not stay on quietly here, like us, and be jolly? You don't know this hotel out of the season, and what fun we have among ourselves, we fellows who remain and see the whole interesting year out. All very true, no doubt, the others always reply; we quite envy you—and some other year perhaps—but just now we have engagements—and there's the bus at the door—our time is up! So they depart, with a smile and a nod, and we miss them, and feel resentful. The Rat was a self-sufficing sort of animal, rooted to the land, and whoever went, he stayed; still he could not help noticing what was in the air, and feeling some of its influence in his bones.

It was difficult to settle down to anything seriously, with all this flitting going on. Leaving the water-side, where rushes stood thick and tall in a stream that was becoming sluggish and low, he wandered countrywards, crossed a field or two of pasturage already looking dusty and parched, and thrust into the great sea of wheat, yellow, wavy, and murmurous, full of quiet motion and small whisperings. Here he often loved to wander, through the forest of stiff strong stalks that carried their own golden sky away over his head—a sky that was always dancing, shimmering, softly talking; or swaying strongly to the passing wind and recovering itself with a toss and a merry laugh. Here, too, he had many small friends, a society complete in itself, leading full and busy lives, but always with a spare moment to gossip, and exchange news with a visitor. Today, however, though they were civil enough, the field-mice and harvest-mice seemed preoccupied. Many were digging and tunnelling busily; others, gathered together in small groups examined plans and drawings of small flats, stated to be desirable and compact, and situated conveniently near the Stores. Some were hauling out dusty trunks and dress-baskets, others were already elbow-deep packing their belongings; while everywhere piles and bundles of wheat, oats, barley, beechmast and nuts, lay about ready for transport.

"Here's old Ratty!" they cried as soon as they saw him. "Come and bear a hand, Rat, and don't stand about idle!"

"What sort of games are you up to?" said the Water Rat severely. "You know it isn't time to be thinking of winter quarters yet, by a long way!"

"O yes, we know that," explained a field-mouse rather shamefacedly; "but it's always as well to be in good time, isn't it? We really MUST get all the furniture and baggage and stores moved out of this before those horrid machines begin clicking round the fields; and then, you know, the best flats get picked up so quickly nowadays, and if you're late you have to put up with ANYTHING; and they want such a lot of doing up, too, before they're fit to move into. Of course, we're early, we know that; but we're only just making a start."

"O, bother STARTS," said the Rat. "It's a splendid day. Come for a row, or a stroll along the hedges, or a picnic in the woods, or something."

"Well, I THINK not TODAY, thank you," replied the field-mouse hurriedly. "Perhaps some OTHER day—when we've more TIME—"

The Rat, with a snort of contempt, swung round to go, tripped over a hat-box, and fell, with undignified remarks.

"If people would be more careful," said a field-mouse rather stiffly, "and look where they're going, people wouldn't hurt themselves—and forget themselves. Mind that hold-all, Rat! You'd better sit down somewhere. In an hour or two we may be more free to attend to you."

"You won't be 'free', as you call it much this side of Christmas, I can see that," retorted the Rat grumpily, as he picked his way out of the field.

He returned somewhat despondently to his river again—his faithful, steady-going old river, which never packed up, flitted, or went into winter quarters.

In the osiers which fringed the bank he spied a swallow sitting. Presently it was joined by another, and then by a third; and the birds, fidgeting restlessly on their bough, talked together earnestly and low.

"What, ALREADY," said the Rat, strolling up to them. "What's the hurry? I call it simply ridiculous."

"O, we're not off yet, if that's what you mean," replied the first swallow. "We're only making plans and arranging things. Talking it over, you know—what route we're taking this year, and where we'll stop, and so on. That's half the fun!"

"Fun?" said the Rat; "now that's just what I don't understand. If you've GOT to leave this pleasant place, and your friends who will miss you, and your snug homes that you've just settled into, why, when the hour strikes I've no doubt you'll go bravely, and face all the trouble and discomfort and change and newness, and make believe that you're not very unhappy. But to want to talk about it, or even think about it, till you really need—"

"No, you don't understand, naturally," said the second swallow. "First, we feel it stirring within us, a sweet unrest; then back come the recollections one by one, like homing pigeons. They flutter through our dreams at night, they fly with us in our wheelings and circlings by day. We hunger to inquire of each other, to compare notes and assure ourselves that it was all really true, as one by one the scents and sounds and names of long-forgotten places come gradually back and beckon to us."

"Couldn't you stop on for just this year?" suggested the Water Rat wistfully. "We'll all do our best to make you feel at home. You've no idea what good times we have here, while you are far away."

"I tried 'stopping on' one year," said the third swallow. "I had grown so fond of the place that when the time came I hung back and let the others go on without me. For a few weeks it was all well enough, but afterwards, O the weary length of the nights! The shivering, sunless days! The air so clammy and chill, and not an insect in an acre of it! No, it was no good; my courage broke down, and one cold, stormy night I took wing, flying well inland on account of the strong easterly gales. It was snowing hard as I beat through the passes of the great mountains, and I had a stiff fight to win through; but never shall I forget the blissful feeling of the hot sun again on my back as I sped down to the lakes that lay so blue and placid below me, and the taste of my first fat insect! The past was like a bad dream; the future was all happy holiday as I moved Southwards week by week, easily, lazily, lingering as long as I dared, but always heeding the call! No, I had had my warning; never again did I think of disobedience."

"Ah, yes, the call of the South, of the South!" twittered the other two dreamily. "Its songs its hues, its radiant air! O, do you remember—" and, forgetting the Rat, they slid into passionate reminiscence, while he listened fascinated, and his heart burned within him. In himself, too, he knew that it was vibrating at last, that chord hitherto dormant and unsuspected. The mere chatter of these southern-bound birds, their pale and second-hand reports, had yet power to awaken this wild new sensation and thrill him through and through with it; what would one moment of the real thing work in him—one passionate touch of the real southern sun, one waft of the authentic odor? With closed eyes he dared to dream a moment in full abandonment, and when he looked again the river seemed steely and chill, the green fields grey and lightless. Then his loyal heart seemed to cry out on his weaker self for its treachery.

"Why do you ever come back, then, at all?" he demanded of the swallows jealously. "What do you find to attract you in this poor drab little country?"

"And do you think," said the first swallow, "that the other call is not for us too, in its due season? The call of lush meadow-grass, wet orchards, warm, insect-haunted ponds, of browsing cattle, of haymaking, and all the farm-buildings clustering round the House of the perfect Eaves?"

"Do you suppose," asked the second one, "that you are the only living thing that craves with a hungry longing to hear the cuckoo's note again?"

"In due time," said the third, "we shall be home-sick once more for quiet water-lilies swaying on the surface of an English stream. But today all that seems pale and thin and very far away. Just now our blood dances to other music."

They fell a-twittering among themselves once more, and this time their intoxicating babble was of violet seas, tawny sands, and lizard-haunted walls.

Restlessly the Rat wandered off once more, climbed the slope that rose gently from the north bank of the river, and lay looking out towards the great ring of Downs that barred his vision further southwards—his simple horizon hitherto, his Mountains of the Moon, his limit behind which lay nothing he had cared to see or to know. Today, to him gazing south with a new-born need stirring in his heart, the clear sky over their long low outline seemed to pulsate with promise; today, the unseen was everything, the unknown the only real fact of life. On this side of the hills was now the real blank, on the other lay the crowded and coloured panorama that his inner eye was seeing so clearly. What seas lay beyond, green, leaping, and crested! What sun-bathed coasts, along which the white villas glittered against the olive woods! What quiet harbours, thronged with gallant shipping bound for purple islands of wine and spice, islands set low in languorous waters!

He rose and descended river-wards once more; then changed his mind and sought the side of the dusty lane. There, lying half-buried in the thick, cool under-hedge tangle that bordered it, he could muse on the metalled road and all the wondrous world that it led to; on all the wayfarers, too, that might have trodden it, and the fortunes and adventures they had gone to seek or found unseeking—out there, beyond—beyond!

Footsteps fell on his ear, and the figure of one that walked somewhat wearily came into view; and he saw that it was a Rat, and a very dusty one. The wayfarer, as he reached him, saluted with a gesture of courtesy that had something foreign about it—hesitated a moment—then with a pleasant smile turned from the track and sat down by his side in the cool herbage. He seemed tired, and the Rat let him rest unquestioned, understanding something of what was in his thoughts; knowing, too, the value all animals attach at times to mere silent companionship, when the weary muscles slacken and the mind marks time.

The wayfarer was lean and keen-featured, and somewhat bowed at the shoulders; his paws were thin and long, his eyes much wrinkled at the corners, and he wore small gold earrings in his neatly-set, well-shaped ears. His knitted jersey was of a faded blue, his breeches patched and stained, were based on a blue foundation, and his small belongings that he carried were tied up in a blue cotton handkerchief.

When he had rested awhile the stranger sighed, snuffed the air, and looked about him.

"That was clover, that warm whiff on the breeze," he remarked; "and those are cows we hear cropping the grass behind us and blowing softly between mouthfuls. There is a sound of distant reapers, and yonder rises a blue line of cottage smoke against the woodland. The river runs somewhere close by, for I hear the call of a moorhen, and I see by your build that you're a fresh-water mariner. Everything seems asleep, and yet going on all the time. It is a goodly life that you lead, friend; no doubt the best in the world, if only you are strong enough to lead it!"

"Yes, it's THE life, the only life, to live," responded the Water Rat dreamily, and without his usual whole-hearted conviction.

"I did not say exactly that," replied the stranger cautiously; "but no doubt it's the best. I've tried it, and I know. And because I've just tried it—six months of it—and know it's the best, here am I, footsore and hungry, tramping away from it, tramping southward, following the old call, back to the old life, THE life which is mine and which will not let me go."

"Is this, then, yet another of them?" mused the Rat. "And where have you just come from?" he asked. He hardly dared to ask where he was bound for; he seemed to know the answer only too well.

"Nice little farm," replied the wayfarer, briefly. "Upalong in that direction" —he nodded northwards. "Never mind about it. I had everything I could want—everything I had any right to expect of life, and more; and here I am! Glad to be here all the same, though, glad to be here! So many miles further on the road, so many hours nearer to my heart's desire!"

His shining eyes held fast to the horizon, and he seemed to be listening for some sound that was wanting from that inland acreage, vocal as it was with the cheerful music of pasturage and farmyard.

"You are not one of US," said the Water Rat, "nor yet a farmer; nor even, I should judge, of this country."

"Right," replied the stranger. "I'm a seafaring rat, I am, and the port I originally hail from is Constantinople, though I'm a sort of a foreigner there too, in a manner of speaking. You will have heard of Constantinople, friend? A fair city, and an ancient and glorious one. And you may have heard, too, of Sigurd, King of Norway, and how he sailed thither with sixty ships, and how he and his men rode up through streets all canopied in their honour with purple and gold; and how the Emperor and Empress came down and banqueted with him on board his ship. When Sigurd returned home, many of his Northmen remained behind and entered the Emperor's bodyguard, and my ancestor, a Norwegian born, stayed behind too, with the ships that Sigurd gave the Emperor. Seafarers we have ever been, and no wonder; as for me, the city of my birth is no more my home than any pleasant port between there and the London River. I know them all, and they know me. Set me down on any of their quays or foreshores, and I am home again."

"I suppose you go great voyages," said the Water Rat with growing interest. "Months and months out of sight of land, and provisions running short, and allowanced as to water, and your mind communing with the mighty ocean, and all that sort of thing?"

"By no means," said the Sea Rat frankly. "Such a life as you describe would not suit me at all. I'm in the coasting trade, and rarely out of sight of land. It's the jolly times on shore that appeal to me, as much as any seafaring. O, those southern seaports! The smell of them, the riding-lights at night, the glamour!"

"Well, perhaps you have chosen the better way," said the Water Rat, but rather doubtfully. "Tell me something of your coasting, then, if you have a mind to, and what sort of harvest an animal of spirit might hope to bring home from it to warm his latter days with gallant memories by the fireside; for my life, I confess to you, feels to me today somewhat narrow and circumscribed."

"My last voyage," began the Sea Rat, "that landed me eventually in this country, bound with high hopes for my inland farm, will serve as a good example of any of them, and, indeed, as an epitome of my highly-coloured life. Family troubles, as usual, began it. The domestic storm-cone was hoisted, and I shipped myself on board a small trading vessel bound from Constantinople, by classic seas whose every wave throbs with a deathless memory, to the Grecian Islands and the Levant. Those were golden days and balmy nights! In and out of harbour all the time—old friends everywhere—sleeping in some cool temple or ruined cistern during the heat of the day—feasting and song after sundown, under great stars set in a velvet sky! Thence we turned and coasted up the Adriatic, its shores swimming in an atmosphere of amber, rose, and aquamarine; we lay in wide land-locked harbours, we roamed through ancient and noble cities, until at last one morning, as the sun rose royally behind us, we rode into Venice down a path of gold. O, Venice is a fine city, wherein a rat can wander at his ease and take his pleasure! Or, when weary of wandering, can sit at the edge of the Grand Canal at night, feasting with his friends, when the air is full of music and the sky full of stars, and the lights flash and shimmer on the polished steel prows of the swaying gondolas, packed so that you could walk across the canal on them from side to side! And then the food—do you like shell-fish? Well, well, we won't linger over that now."

He was silent for a time; and the Water Rat, silent too and enthralled, floated on dream-canals and heard a phantom song pealing high between vaporous grey wave-lapped walls.

"Southwards we sailed again at last," continued the Sea Rat, "coasting down the Italian shore, till finally we made Palermo, and there I quitted for a long, happy spell on shore. I never stick too long to one ship; one gets narrow-minded and prejudiced. Besides, Sicily is one of my happy hunting-grounds. I know everybody there, and their ways just suit me. I spent many jolly weeks in the island, staying with friends up country. When I grew restless again I took advantage of a ship that was trading to Sardinia and Corsica; and very glad I was to feel the fresh breeze and the sea-spray in my face once more."

"But isn't it very hot and stuffy, down in the—hold, I think you call it?" asked the Water Rat.

The seafarer looked at him with the suspicion go a wink. "I'm an old hand," he remarked with much simplicity. "The captain's cabin's good enough for me."

"It's a hard life, by all accounts," murmured the Rat, sunk in deep thought.

"For the crew it is," replied the seafarer gravely, again with the ghost of a wink.

"From Corsica," he went on, "I made use of a ship that was taking wine to the mainland. We made Alassio in the evening, lay to, hauled up our winecasks, and hove them overboard, tied one to the other by a long line. Then the crew took to the boats and rowed shorewards, singing as they went, and drawing after them the long bobbing procession of casks, like a mile of porpoises. On the sands they had horses waiting, which dragged the casks up the steep street of the little town with a fine rush and clatter and scramble. When the last cask was in, we went and refreshed and rested, and sat late into the night, drinking with our friends; and next morning I took to the great olive-woods for a spell and a rest. For now I had done with islands for the time, and ports and shipping were plentiful; so I led a lazy life among the peasants, lying and watching them work, or stretched high on the hillside with the blue Mediterranean far below me. And so at length, by easy stages, and partly on foot, partly by sea, to Marseilles, and the meeting of old shipmates, and the visiting of great oceanbound vessels, and feasting once more. Talk of shell-fish! Why, sometimes I dream of the shell-fish of Marseilles, and wake up crying!"

"That reminds me," said the polite Water Rat; "you happened to mention that you were hungry, and I ought to have spoken earlier. Of course, you will stop and take your midday meal with me? My hole is close by; it is some time past noon, and you are very welcome to whatever there is."

"Now I call that kind and brotherly of you," said the Sea Rat. "I was indeed hungry when I sat down, and ever since I inadvertently happened to mention shell-fish, my pangs have been extreme. But couldn't you fetch it along out here? I am none too fond of going under hatches, unless I'm obliged to; and then, while we eat, I could tell you more concerning my voyages and the pleasant life I lead—at least, it is very pleasant to me, and by your attention I judge it commends itself to you; whereas if we go indoors it is a hundred to one that I shall presently fall asleep."

"That is indeed an excellent suggestion," said the Water Rat, and hurried off home. There he got out the luncheon-basket and packed a simple meal, in which, remembering the stranger's origin and preferences, he took care to include a yard of long French bread, a sausage out of which the garlic sang, some cheese which lay down and cried, and a long-necked straw-covered flask containing bottled sunshine shed and garnered on far Southern slopes. Thus laden, he returned with all speed, and blushed for pleasure at the old seaman's commendations of his taste and judgment, as together they unpacked the basket and laid out the contents on the grass by the roadside.

The Sea Rat, as soon as his hunger was somewhat assuaged, continued the history of his latest voyage, conducting his simple hearer from port to port of Spain, landing him at Lisbon, Oporto, and Bordeaux, introducing him to the pleasant harbours of Cornwall and Devon, and so up the Channel to that final quayside, where, landing after winds long contrary, storm-driven and weather-beaten, he had caught the first magical hints and heraldings of another Spring, and, fired by these, had sped on a long tramp inland, hungry for the experiment of life on some quiet farmstead, very far from the weary beating of any sea.

Spellbound and quivering with excitement, the Water Rat followed the Adventurer league by league, over stormy bays, through crowded roadsteads, across harbour bars on a racing tide, up winding rivers that hid their busy little towns round a sudden turn; and left him with a regretful sigh planted at his dull inland farm, about which he desired to hear nothing.

By this time their meal was over, and the Seafarer, refreshed and strengthened, his voice more vibrant, his eye lit with a brightness that seemed caught from some far-away sea-beacon, filled his glass with the red and glowing vintage of the South, and, leaning towards the Water Rat, compelled his gaze and held him, body and soul, while he talked. Those eyes were of the changing foam-streaked grey-green of leaping Northern seas; in the glass shone a hot ruby that seemed the very heart of the South, beating for him who had courage to respond to its pulsation. The twin lights, the shifting grey and the steadfast red, mastered the Water Rat and held him bound, fascinated, powerless. The quiet world outside their rays receded far away and ceased to be. And the talk, the wonderful talk flowed on—or was it speech entirely, or did it pass at times into song—chanty of the sailors weighing the dripping anchor, sonorous hum of the shrouds in a tearing North-Easter, ballad of the fisherman hauling his nets at sundown against an apricot sky, chords of guitar and mandoline from gondola or caique? Did it change into the cry of the wind, plaintive at first, angrily shrill as it freshened, rising to a tearing whistle, sinking to a musical trickle of air from the leech of the bellying sail? All these sounds the spell-bound listener seemed to hear, and with them the hungry complaint of the gulls and the sea-mews, the soft thunder of the breaking wave, the cry of the protesting shingle. Back into speech again it passed, and with beating heart he was following the adventures of a dozen seaports, the fights, the escapes, the rallies, the comradeships, the gallant undertakings; or he searched islands for treasure, fished in still lagoons and dozed day-long on warm white sand. Of deep-sea fishings he heard tell, and mighty silver gatherings of the mile-long net; of sudden perils, noise of breakers on a moonless night, or the tall bows of the great liner taking shape overhead through the fog; of the merry home-coming, the headland rounded, the harbour lights opened out; the groups seen dimly on the quay, the cheery hail, the splash of the hawser; the trudge up the steep little street towards the comforting glow of red-curtained windows.

Lastly, in his waking dream it seemed to him that the Adventurer had risen to his feet, but was still speaking, still holding him fast with his sea-grey eyes.

"And now," he was softly saying, "I take to the road again, holding on south-westwards for many a long and dusty day; till at last I reach the little grey sea town I know so well, that clings along one steep side of the harbour. There through dark doorways you look down flights of stone steps, overhung by great pink tufts of valerian and ending in a patch of sparkling blue water. The little boats that lie tethered to the rings and stanchions of the old sea-wall are gaily painted as those I clambered in and out of in my own childhood; the salmon leap on the flood tide, schools of mackerel flash and play past quay-sides and foreshores, and by the windows the great vessels glide, night and day, up to their moorings or forth to the open sea. There, sooner or later, the ships of all seafaring nations arrive; and there, at its destined hour, the ship of my choice will let go its anchor. I shall take my time, I shall tarry and bide, till at last the right one lies waiting for me, warped out into midstream, loaded low, her bowsprit pointing down harbour. I shall slip on board, by boat or along hawser; and then one morning I shall wake to the song and tramp of the sailors, the clink of the capstan, and the rattle of the anchor-chain coming merrily in. We shall break out the jib and the foresail, the white houses on the harbour side will glide slowly past us as she gathers steering-way, and the voyage will have begun! As she forges towards the headland she will clothe herself with canvas; and then, once outside, the sounding slap of great green seas as she heels to the wind, pointing South!

"And you, you will come too, young brother; for the days pass, and never return, and the South still waits for you. Take the Adventure, heed the call, now ere the irrevocable moment passes! 'Tis but a banging of the door behind you, a blithesome step forward, and you are out of the old life and into the new! Then some day, some day long hence, jog home here if you will, when the cup has been drained and the play has been played, and sit down by your quiet river with a store of goodly memories for company. You can easily overtake me on the road, for you are young, and I am ageing and go softly. I will linger, and look back; and at last I will surely see you coming, eager and light-hearted, with all the South in your face!"

The voice died away and ceased, as an insect's tiny trumpet dwindles swiftly into silence; and the Water Rat, paralysed and staring, saw at last but a distant speck on the white surface of the road.

Mechanically he rose and proceeded to repack the luncheon-basket, carefully and without haste. Mechanically he returned home, gathered together a few small necessaries and special treasures he was fond of, and put them in a satchel; acting with slow deliberation, moving about the room like a sleep-walker; listening ever with parted lips. He swung the satchel over his shoulder, carefully selected a stout stick for his wayfaring, and with no haste, but with no hesitation at all, he stepped across the threshold just as the Mole appeared at the door.

"Why, where are you off to, Ratty?" asked the Mole in great surprise, grasping him by the arm.

"Going South, with the rest of them," murmured the Rat in a dreamy monotone, never looking at him. "Seawards first and then on shipboard, and so to the shores that are calling me!"

He pressed resolutely forward, still without haste, but with dogged fixity of purpose; but the Mole, now thoroughly alarmed, placed himself in front of him, and looking into his eyes saw that they were glazed and set and turned a streaked and shifting grey—not his friend's eyes, but the eyes of some other animal! Grappling with him strongly he dragged him inside, threw him down, and held him.

The Rat struggled desperately for a few moments, and then his strength seemed suddenly to leave him, and he lay still and exhausted, with closed eyes, trembling. Presently the Mole assisted him to rise and placed him in a chair, where he sat collapsed and shrunken into himself, his body shaken by a violent shivering, passing in time into an hysterical fit of dry sobbing. Mole made the door fast, threw the satchel into a drawer and locked it, and sat down quietly on the table by his friend, waiting for the strange seizure to pass. Gradually the Rat sank into a troubled doze, broken by starts and confused murmurings of things strange and wild and foreign to the unenlightened Mole; and from that he passed into a deep slumber.

Very anxious in mind, the Mole left him for a time and busied himself with household matters; and it was getting dark when he returned to the parlour and found the Rat where he had left him, wide awake indeed, but listless, silent, and dejected. He took one hasty glance at his eyes; found them, to his great gratification, clear and dark and brown again as before; and then sat down and tried to cheer him up and help him to relate what had happened to him.

Poor Ratty did his best, by degrees, to explain things; but how could he put into cold words what had mostly been suggestion? How recall, for another's benefit, the haunting sea voices that had sung to him, how reproduce at second-hand the magic of the Seafarer's hundred reminiscences? Even to himself, now the spell was broken and the glamour gone, he found it difficult to account for what had seemed, some hours ago, the inevitable and only thing. It is not surprising, then, that he failed to convey to the Mole any clear idea of what he had been through that day.

To the Mole this much was plain: the fit, or attack, had passed away, and had left him sane again, though shaken and cast down by the reaction. But he seemed to have lost all interest for the time in the things that went to make up his daily life, as well as in all pleasant forecastings of the altered days and doings that the changing season was surely bringing.

Casually, then, and with seeming indifference, the Mole turned his talk to the harvest that was being gathered in, the towering wagons and their straining teams, the growing ricks, and the large moon rising over bare acres dotted with sheaves. He talked of the reddening apples around, of the browning nuts, of jams and preserves and the distilling of cordials; till by easy stages such as these he reached mid-winter, its hearty joys and its snug home life, and then he became simply lyrical.

By degrees the Rat began to sit up and to join in. His dull eye brightened, and he lost some of his listening air.

Presently the tactful Mole slipped away and returned with a pencil and a few half-sheets of paper, which he placed on the table at his friend's elbow.

"It's quite a long time since you did any poetry," he remarked. "You might have a try at it this evening, instead of—well, brooding over things so much. I've an idea that you'll feel a lot better when you've got something jotted down—if it's only just the rhymes."

The Rat pushed the paper away from him wearily, but the discreet Mole took occasion to leave the room, and when he peeped in again some time later, the Rat was absorbed and deaf to the world; alternately scribbling and sucking the top of his pencil. It is true that he sucked a good deal more than he scribbled; but it was joy to the Mole to know that the cure had at least begun.





Chapter X The Further Adventure of Toad


The front door of the hollow tree faced eastwards, so Toad was called at an early hour; partly by the bright sunlight streaming in on him, partly by the exceeding coldness of his toes, which made him dream that he was at home in bed in his own handsome room with the Tudor window, on a cold winter's night, and his bedclothes had got up, grumbling and protesting they couldn't stand the cold any longer, and had run downstairs to the kitchen fire to warm themselves; and he had followed, on bare feet, along miles and miles of icy stone-paved passages, arguing and beseeching them to be reasonable. He would probably have been aroused much earlier, had he not slept for some weeks on straw over stone flags, and almost forgotten the friendly feeling of thick blankets pulled well up round the chin.

Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes first and his complaining toes next, wondered for a moment where he was, looking round for familiar stone wall and little barred window; then, with a leap of the heart, remembered everything—his escape, his flight, his pursuit; remembered, first and best thing of all, that he was free!

Free! The word and the thought alone were worth fifty blankets. He was warm from end to end as he thought of the jolly world outside, waiting eagerly for him to make his triumphal entrance, ready to serve him and play up to him, anxious to help him and to keep him company, as it always had been in days of old before misfortune fell upon him. He shook himself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his fingers; and, his toilet complete, marched forth into the comfortable morning sun, cold but confident, hungry but hopeful, all nervous terrors of yesterday dispelled by rest and sleep and frank andheartening sunshine.

He had the world all to himself, that early summer morning. The dewy woodland, as he threaded it, was solitary and still; the green fields that succeeded the trees were his own to do as he liked with; the road itself, when he reached it, in that loneliness that was everywhere, seemed, like a stray dog, to be looking anxiously for company. Toad, however, was looking for something that could talk, and tell him clearly which way he ought to go. It is all very well, when you have a light heart, and a clear conscience, and money in your pocket, and nobody scouring the country for you to drag you off to prison again, to follow where the road beckons and points, not caring whither. The practical Toad cared very much indeed, and he could have kicked the road for its helpless silence when every minute was of importance to him.

The reserved rustic road was presently joined by a shy little brother in the shape of a canal, which took its hand and ambled along by its side in perfect confidence, but with the same tongue-tied, uncommunicative attitude towards strangers. "Bother them!" said Toad to himself. "But, anyhow, one thing's clear. They must both be coming FROM somewhere, and going TO somewhere. You can't get over that. Toad, my boy!" So he marched on patiently by the water's edge.

Round a bend in the canal came plodding a solitary horse, stooping forward as if in anxious thought. From rope traces attached to his collar stretched a long line, taut, but dipping with his stride, the further part of it dripping pearly drops. Toad let the horse pass, and stood waiting for what the fates were sending him.

With a pleasant swirl of quiet water at its blunt bow the barge slid up alongside of him, its gaily painted gunwale level with the towing-path, its sole occupant a big stout woman wearing a linen sun-bonnet, one brawny arm laid along the tiller.

"A nice morning, ma'am!" she remarked to Toad, as she drew up level with him.

"I dare say it is, ma'am!" responded Toad politely, as he walked along the tow-path abreast of her. "I dare it IS a nice morning to them that's not in sore trouble, like what I am. Here's my married daughter, she sends off to me post-haste to come to her at once; so off I comes, not knowing what may be happening or going to happen, but fearing the worst, as you will understand, ma'am, if you're a mother, too. And I've left my business to look after itself—I'm in the washing and laundering line, you must know, ma'am—and I've left my young children to look after themselves, and a more mischievous and troublesome set of young imps doesn't exist, ma'am; and I've lost all my money, and lost my way, and as for what may be happening to my married daughter, why, I don't like to think of it, ma'am!"

"Where might your married daughter be living, ma'am?" asked the barge-woman.

"She lives near to the river, ma'am," replied Toad. "Close to a fine house called Toad Hall, that's somewheres hereabouts in these parts. Perhaps you may have heard of it."

"Toad Hall? Why, I'm going that way myself," replied the barge-woman. "This canal joins the river some miles further on, a little above Toad Hall; and then it's an easy walk. You come along in the barge with me, and I'll give you a lift."

She steered the barge close to the bank, and Toad, with many humble and grateful acknowledgments, stepped lightly on board and sat down with great satisfaction. "Toad's luck again!" thought he. "I always come out on top!"

"So you're in the washing business, ma'am?" said the barge-woman politely, as they glided along. "And a very good business you've got too, I dare say, if I'm not making too free in saying so."

"Finest business in the whole country," said Toad airily. "All the gentry come to me—wouldn't go to any one else if they were paid, they know me so well. You see, I understand my work thoroughly, and attend to it all myself. Washing, ironing, clear-starching, making up gents' fine shirts for evening wear—everything's done under my own eye!"

"But surely you don't DO all that work yourself, ma'am?" asked the barge-woman respectfully.

"O, I have girls," said Toad lightly: "Twenty girls or thereabouts, always at work. But you know what GIRLS are, ma'am! Nasty little hussies, that's what I call 'em!"

"So do I, too," said the barge-woman with great heartiness. "But I dare say you set yours to rights, the idle trollops! And are you VERY fond of washing?"

"I love it," said Toad. "I simply dote on it. Never so happy as when I've got both arms in the wash-tub. But, then, it comes so easy to me! No trouble at all! A real pleasure, I assure you, ma'am!"

"What a bit of luck, meeting you!" observed the barge-woman thoughtfully. "A regular piece of good fortune for both of us!"

"Why, what do you mean?" asked Toad, nervously.

"Well, look at me, now," replied the barge-woman. "I like washing, too, just the same as you do; and for that matter, whether I like it or not I have got to do all my own, naturally, moving about as I do. Now my husband, he's such a fellow for shirking his work and leaving the barge to me, that never a moment do I get for seeing to my own affairs. By rights he ought to be here now, either steering or attending to the horse, though luckily the horse has sense enough to attend to himself. Instead of which, he's gone off with the dog, to see if they can't pick up a rabbit for dinner somewhere. Says he'll catch me up at the next lock. Well, that's as may be—I don't trust him, once he gets off with that dog, who's worse than he is. But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?"

"O, never mind about the washing," said Toad, not liking the subject. "Try and fix your mind on that rabbit. A nice fat young rabbit, I'll be bound. Got any onions?"

"I can't fix my mind on anything but my washing," said the barge-woman, "and I wonder you can be talking of rabbits, with such a joyful prospect before you. There's a heap of things of mine that you'll find in a corner of the cabin. If you'll just take one or two of the most necessary sort—I won't venture to describe them to a lady like you, but you'll recognise them at a glance—and put them through the wash-tub as we go along, why it'll be a pleasure to you, as you rightly say, and a real help to me. You'll find a tub handy, and soap, and a kettle on the stove, and a bucket to haul up water from the canal with. Then I shall know you're enjoying yourself, instead of sitting here idle, looking at the scenery and yawning your head off."

"Here, you let me steer!" said Toad, now thoroughly frightened, "and then you can get on with your washing your own way. I might spoil your things, or not do 'em as you like. I'm more used to gentlemen's things myself. It's my special line."

"Let you steer?" replied the barge-woman, laughing. "It takes some practice to steer a barge properly. Besides, it's dull work, and I want you to be happy. No, you shall do the washing you are so fond of, and I'll stick to the steering that I understand. Don't try and deprive me of the pleasure of giving you a treat!"

Toad was fairly cornered. He looked for escape this way and that, saw that he was too far from the bank for a flying leap, and sullenly resigned himself to his fate. "If it comes to that," he thought in desperation, "I suppose any fool can WASH!"

He fetched tub, soap, and other necessaries from the cabin, selected a few garments at random, tried to recollect what he had seen in casual glances through laundry windows, and set to.

A long half-hour passed, and every minute of it saw Toad getting crosser and crosser. Nothing that he could do to the things seemed to please them or do them good. He tried coaxing, he tried slapping, he tried punching; they smiled back at him out of the tub unconverted, happy in their original sin. Once or twice he looked nervously over his shoulder at the barge-woman, but she appeared to be gazing out in front of her, absorbed in her steering. His back ached badly, and he noticed with dismay that his paws were beginning to get all crinkly. Now Toad was very proud of his paws. He muttered under his breath words that should never pass the lips of either washerwomen or Toads; and lost the soap, for the fiftieth time.

A burst of laughter made him straighten himself and look round. The barge-woman was leaning back and laughing unrestrainedly, till the tears ran down her cheeks.

"I've been watching you all the time," she gasped. "I thought you must be a humbug all along, from the conceited way you talked. Pretty washerwoman you are! Never washed so much as a dish-clout in your life, I'll lay!"

Toad's temper, which had been simmering viciously for some time, now fairly boiled over, and he lost all control of himself.

"You common, low, FAT barge-woman!" he shouted; "don't you dare to talk to your betters like that! Washerwoman indeed! I would have you to know that I am a Toad, a very well-known, respected, distinguished Toad! I may be under a bit of a cloud at present, but I will NOT be laughed at by a barge-woman!"

The woman moved nearer to him and peered under his bonnet keenly and closely. "Why, so you are!" she cried. "Well, I never! A horrid, nasty, crawly Toad! And in my nice clean barge, too! Now that is a thing that I will NOT have."

She relinquished the tiller for a moment. One big mottled arm shot out and caught Toad by a fore-leg, while the other gripped him fast by a hindleg. Then the world turned suddenly upside down, the barge seemed to flit lightly across the sky, the wind whistled in his ears, and Toad found himself flying through the air, revolving rapidly as he went.

The water, when he eventually reached it with a loud splash, proved quite cold enough for his taste, though its chill was not sufficient to quell his proud spirit, or shake the heat of his furious temper. He rose to the surface spluttering, and when he had wiped the duckweed out of his eyes the first thing he saw was the fat barge-woman looking back at him over the stern of the retreating barge and laughing; and he vowed, as he coughed and choked, to be even with her.

He struck out for the shore, but the cotton gown greatly impeded his efforts, and when at length he touched land he found it hard to climb up the steep bank unassisted. He had to take a minute or two's rest to recover his breath; then gathering his wet skirts well over his arms, he started to run after the barge as fast as his legs would carry him, wild with indignation, thirsting for revenge.

The barge-woman was still laughing when he drew up level with her. "Put yourself through your mangle, washerwoman," she called out, "and iron your face and crimp it, and you'll pass for quite a decent-looking Toad!"

Toad never paused to reply. Solid revenge was what he wanted, not cheap, windy, verbal triumphs, though he had a thing or two in his mind that he would have liked to say. He saw what he wanted ahead of him. Running swiftly on he overtook the horse, unfastened the towrope and cast off, jumped lightly on the horse's back, and urged it to a gallop by kicking it vigorously in the sides. He steered for the open country, abandoning the tow-path, and swinging his steed down a rutty lane. Once he looked back, and saw that the barge had run aground on the other side of the canal, and the barge-woman was gesticulating wildly and shouting, "Stop, stop, stop!" "I've heard that song before," said Toad, laughing, as he continued to spur his steed onward in its wild career.

The barge-horse was not capable of any very sustained effort, and its gallop soon subsided into a trot, and its trot into an easy walk; but Toad was quite contented with this, knowing that he, at any rate, was moving, and the barge was not. He had quite recovered his temper, now that he had done something he thought really clever; and he was satisfied to jog along quietly in the sun, steering his horse along by-ways and bridle-paths, and trying to forget how very long it was since he had had a square meal, till the canal had been left very far behind him.

He had travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he was feeling drowsy in the hot sunshine, when the horse stopped, lowered his head, and began to nibble the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from falling off by an effort. He looked about him and found he was on a wide common, dotted with patches of gorse and bramble as far as he could see. Near him stood a dingy gipsy caravan, and beside it a man was sitting on a bucket turned upside down, very busy smoking and staring into the wide world. A fire of sticks was burning nearby, and over the fire hung an iron pot, and out of that pot came forth bubblings and gurglings, and a vague suggestive steaminess. Also smells—warm, rich, and varied smells—that twined and twisted and wreathed themselves at last into one complete, voluptuous, perfect smell that seemed like the very soul of Nature taking form and appearing to her children, a true Goddess, a mother of solace and comfort. Toad now knew well that he had not been really hungry before. What he had felt earlier in the day had been a mere trifling qualm. This was the real thing at last, and no mistake; and it would have to be dealt with speedily, too, or there would be trouble for somebody or something. He looked the gipsy over carefully, wondering vaguely whether it would be easier to fight him or cajole him. So there he sat, and sniffed and sniffed, and looked at the gipsy; and the gipsy sat and smoked, and looked at him.

Presently the gipsy took his pipe out of his mouth and remarked in a careless way, "Want to sell that there horse of yours?"

Toad was completely taken aback. He did not know that gipsies were very fond of horse-dealing, and never missed an opportunity, and he had not reflected that caravans were always on the move and took a deal of drawing. It had not occurred to him to turn the horse into cash, but the gipsy's suggestion seemed to smooth the way towards the two things he wanted so badly—ready money, and a solid breakfast.

"What?" he said, "me sell this beautiful young horse of mine? O, no; it's out of the question. Who's going to take the washing home to my customers every week? Besides, I'm too fond of him, and he simply dotes on me."

"Try and love a donkey," suggested the gipsy. "Some people do."

"You don't seem to see," continued Toad, "that this fine horse of mine is a cut above you altogether. He's a blood horse, he is, partly; not the part you see, of course—another part. And he's been a Prize Hackney, too, in his time—that was the time before you knew him, but you can still tell it on him at a glance, if you understand anything about horses. No, it's not to be thought of for a moment. All the same, how much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young horse of mine?"

The gipsy looked the horse over, and then he looked Toad over with equal care, and looked at the horse again. "Shillin' a leg," he said briefly, and turned away, continuing to smoke and try to stare the wide world out of countenance.

"A shilling a leg?" cried Toad. "If you please, I must take a little time to work that out, and see just what it comes to."

He climbed down off his horse, and left it to graze, and sat down by the gipsy, and did sums on his fingers, and at last he said, "A shilling a leg? Why, that comes to exactly four shillings, and no more. O, no; I could not think of accepting four shillings for this beautiful young horse of mine."

"Well," said the gipsy, "I'll tell you what I will do. I'll make it five shillings, and that's three-and-sixpence more than the animal's worth. And that's my last word."

Then Toad sat and pondered long and deeply. For he was hungry and quite penniless, and still some way—he knew not how far—from home, and enemies might still be looking for him. To one in such a situation, five shillings may very well appear a large sum of money. On the other hand, it did not seem very much to get for a horse. But then, again, the horse hadn't cost him anything; so whatever he got was all clear profit. At last he said firmly, "Look here, gipsy! I tell you what we will do; and this is MY last word. You shall hand me over six shillings and sixpence, cash down; and further, in addition there-to, you shall give me as much breakfast as I can possibly eat, at one sitting of course, out of that iron pot of yours that keeps sending forth such delicious and exciting smells. In return, I will make over to you my spirited young horse, with all the beautiful harness and trappings that are on him, freely thrown in. If that's not good enough for you, say so, and I'll be getting on. I know a man near here who's wanted this horse of mine for years."

The gipsy grumbled frightfully, and declared if he did a few more deals of that sort he'd be ruined. But in the end he lugged a dirty canvas bag out of the depths of his trouser pocket, and counted out six shillings and sixpence into Toad's paw. Then he disappeared into the caravan for an instant, and returned with a large iron plate and a knife, fork, and spoon. He tilted up the pot, and a glorious stream of hot rich stew gurgled into the plate. It was, indeed, the most beautiful stew in the world, being made of partridges, and pheasants, and chickens, and hares, and rabbits, and peahens, and guineafowls, and one or two other things. Toad took the plate on his lap, almost crying, and stuffed, and stuffed, and stuffed, and kept asking for more, and the gipsy never grudged it him. He thought that he had never eaten so good a breakfast in all his life.

When Toad had taken as much stew on board as he thought he could possibly hold, he got up and said good-bye to the gipsy, and took an affectionate farewell of the horse; and the gipsy, who knew the riverside well, gave him directions which way to go, and he set forth on his travels again in the best possible spirits. He was, indeed, a very different Toad from the animal of an hour ago. The sun was shining brightly, his wet clothes were quite dry again, he had money in his pocket once more, he was nearing home and friends and safety, and, most and best of all, he had had a substantial meal, hot and nourishing, and felt big, and strong, and careless, and self-confident.

As he tramped along gaily, he thought of his adventures and escapes, and how when things seemed at their worst he had always managed to find a way out; and his pride and conceit began to swell within him. "Ho, ho!" he said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air, "what a clever Toad I am! There is surely no animal equal to me for cleverness in the whole world! My enemies shut me up in prison, encircled by sentries, watched night and day by warders; I walk out through them all, by sheer ability coupled with courage. They pursue me with engines, and policemen, and revolvers; I snap my fingers at them, and vanish, laughing, into space. I am, unfortunately, thrown into a canal by a woman fat of body and very evil-minded. What of it? I swim ashore, I seize her horse, I ride off in triumph, and I sell the horse for a whole pocketful of money and an excellent breakfast! Ho, ho! I am The Toad, the handsome, the popular, the successful Toad!" He got so puffed up with conceit that he made up a song as he walked in praise of himself, and sang it at the top of his voice, though there was no one to hear it but him. It was perhaps the most conceited song that any animal ever composed.





"The world has held great Heroes,

As history-books have showed;

But never a name to go down to fame

Compared with that of Toad!





"The clever men at Oxford

Know all that there is to be knowed.

But they none of them know one half as much

As intelligent Mr. Toad!





"The animals sat in the Ark and cried,

Their tears in torrents flowed.

Who was it said, 'There's land ahead?'

Encouraging Mr. Toad!





"The Army all saluted

As they marched along the road.

Was it the King? Or Kitchener?

No. It was Mr. Toad.





"The Queen and her Ladies-in-waiting

Sat at the window and sewed.

She cried, 'Look! who's that HANDSOME man?'

They answered, 'Mr. Toad.'"





There was a great deal more of the same sort, but too dreadfully conceited to be written down. These are some of the milder verses.

He sang as he walked, and he walked as he sang, and got more inflated every minute. But his pride was shortly to have a severe fall.

After some miles of country lanes he reached the high road, and as he turned into it and glanced along its white length, he saw approaching him a speck that turned into a dot and then into a blob, and then into something very familiar; and a double note of warning, only too well known, fell on his delighted ear.

"This is something like!" said the excited Toad. "This is real life again, this is once more the great world from which I have been missed so long! I will hail them, my brothers of the wheel, and pitch them a yarn, of the sort that has been so successful hitherto; and they will give me a lift, of course, and then I will talk to them some more; and, perhaps, with luck, it may even end in my driving up to Toad Hall in a motor-car! That will be one in the eye for Badger!"

He stepped confidently out into the road to hail the motor-car, which came along at an easy pace, slowing down as it neared the lane; when suddenly he became very pale, his heart turned to water, his knees shook and yielded under him, and he doubled up and collapsed with a sickening pain in his interior. And well he might, the unhappy animal; for the approaching car was the very one he had stolen out of the yard of the Red Lion Hotel on that fatal day when all his troubles began! And the people in it were the very same people he had sat and watched at luncheon in the coffee-room!

He sank down in a shabby, miserable heap in the road, murmuring to himself in his despair, "It's all up! It's all over now! Chains and policemen again! Prison again! Dry bread and water again! O, what a fool I have been! What did I want to go strutting about the country for, singing conceited songs, and hailing people in broad day on the high road, instead of hiding till nightfall and slipping home quietly by back ways! O hapless Toad! O ill-fated animal!"

The terrible motor-car drew slowly nearer and nearer, till at last he heard it stop just short of him. Two gentlemen got out and walked round the trembling heap of crumpled misery lying in the road, and one of them said, "O dear! this is very sad! Here is a poor old thing—a washerwoman apparently—who has fainted in the road! Perhaps she is overcome by the heat, poor creature; or possibly she has not had any food today. Let us lift her into the car and take her to the nearest village, where doubtless she has friends."

They tenderly lifted Toad into the motor-car and propped him up with soft cushions, and proceeded on their way.

When Toad heard them talk in so kind and sympathetic a way, and knew that he was not recognised, his courage began to revive, and he cautiously opened first one eye and then the other.

"Look!" said one of the gentlemen, "she is better already. The fresh air is doing her good. How do you feel now, ma'am?"

"Thank you kindly, sir," said Toad in a feeble voice, "I'm feeling a great deal better!"

"That's right," said the gentleman. "Now keep quite still, and, above all, don't try to talk."

"I won't," said Toad. "I was only thinking, if I might sit on the front seat there, beside the driver, where I could get the fresh air full in my face, I should soon be all right again."

"What a very sensible woman!" said the gentleman. "Of course you shall." So they carefully helped Toad into the front seat beside the driver, and on they went again.

Toad was almost himself again by now. He sat up, looked about him, and tried to beat down the tremors, the yearnings, the old cravings that rose up and beset him and took possession of him entirely.

"It is fate!" he said to himself. "Why strive? why struggle?" and he turned to the driver at his side.

"Please, Sir," he said, "I wish you would kindly let me try and drive the car for a little. I've been watching you carefully, and it looks so easy and so interesting, and I should like to be able to tell my friends that once I had driven a motor-car!"

The driver laughed at the proposal, so heartily that the gentleman inquired what the matter was. When he heard, he said, to Toad's delight, "Bravo, ma'am! I like your spirit. Let her have a try, and look after her. She won't do any harm." Toad eagerly scrambled into the seat vacated by the driver, took the steering-wheel in his hands, listened with affected humility to the instructions given him, and set the car in motion, but very slowly and carefully at first, for he was determined to be prudent.

The gentlemen behind clapped their hands and applauded, and Toad heard them saying, "How well she does it! Fancy a washerwoman driving a car as well as that, the first time!"

Toad went a little faster; then faster still, and faster. He heard the gentlemen call out warningly, "Be careful, washerwoman!" And this annoyed him, and he began to lose his head.

The driver tried to interfere, but he pinned him down in his seat with one elbow, and put on full speed. The rush of air in his face, the hum of the engines, and the light jump of the car beneath him intoxicated his weak brain. "Washerwoman, indeed!" he shouted recklessly. "Ho! ho! I am the Toad, the motor-car snatcher, the prison-breaker, the Toad who always escapes! Sit still, and you shall know what driving really is, for you are in the hands of the famous, the skilful, the entirely fearless Toad!"

With a cry of horror the whole party rose and flung themselves on him. "Seize him!" they cried, "seize the Toad, the wicked animal who stole our motor-car! Bind him, chain him, drag him to the nearest police-station! Down with the desperate and dangerous Toad!"

Alas! they should have thought, they ought to have been more prudent, they should have remembered to stop the motor-car somehow before playing any pranks of that sort. With a half-turn of the wheel the Toad sent the car crashing through the low hedge that ran along the roadside. One mighty bound, a violent shock, and the wheels of the car were churning up the thick mud of a horse-pond.

Toad found himself flying through the air with the strong upward rush and delicate curve of a swallow. He liked the motion, and was just beginning to wonder whether it would go on until he developed wings and turned into a Toad-bird, when he landed on his back with a thump, in the soft rich grass of a meadow. Sitting up, he could just see the motor-car in the pond, nearly submerged; the gentlemen and the driver, encumbered by their long coats, were floundering helplessly in the water.

He picked himself up rapidly, and set off running across country as hard as he could, scrambling through hedges, jumping ditches, pounding across fields, till he was breathless and weary, and had to settle down into an easy walk. When he had recovered his breath somewhat, and was able to think calmly, he began to giggle, and from giggling he took to laughing, and he laughed till he had to sit down under a hedge. "Ho, ho!" he cried, in ecstasies of self-admiration, "Toad again! Toad, as usual, comes out on the top! Who was it got them to give him a lift? Who managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air? Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive? Who landed them all in a horse-pond? Who escaped, flying gaily and unscathed through the air; leaving the narrow-minded, grudging, timid excursionists in the mud where they should rightly be? Why, Toad, of course; clever Toad, great Toad, GOOD Toad!"

Then he burst into song again, and chanted with uplifted voice—





"The motor-car went Poop-poop-poop,

As it raced along the road.

Who was it steered it into a pond?

Ingenious Mr. Toad!





O, how clever I am! How clever, how clever, how very clev—"

A slight noise at a distance behind him made him turn his head and look. O horror! O misery! O despair!

About two fields off, a chauffeur in his leather gaiters and two large rural policemen were visible, running towards him as hard as they could go!

Poor Toad sprang to his feet and pelted away again, his heart in his mouth. "O, my!" he gasped, as he panted along, "what an ASS I am! What a CONCEITED and heedless ass! Swaggering again! Shouting and singing songs again! Sitting still and gassing again! O my! O my! O my!"

He glanced back, and saw to his dismay that they were gaining on him. On he ran desperately, but kept looking back, and saw that they still gained steadily. He did his best, but he was a fat animal, and his legs were short, and still they gained. He could hear them close behind him now. Ceasing to heed where he was going, he struggled on blindly and wildly, looking back over his shoulder at the now triumphant enemy, when suddenly the earth failed under his feet, he grasped at the air, and, splash! he found himself head over ears in deep water, rapid water, water that bore him along with a force he could not contend with; and he knew that in his blind panic he had run straight into the river!

He rose to the surface and tried to grasp the reeds and the rushes that grew along the water's edge close under the bank, but the stream was so strong that it tore them out of his hands. "O my!" gasped poor Toad, "if ever I steal a motor-car again! If ever I sing another conceited song" —then down he went, and came up breathless and spluttering. Presently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank, just above his head, and as the stream bore him past he reached up with a paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and with difficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at last he was able to rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There he remained for some minutes, puffing and panting, for he was quite exhausted.

As he sighed and blew and stared before him into the dark hole, some bright small thing shone and twinkled in its depths, moving towards him. As it approached, a face grew up gradually around it, and it was a familiar face!

Brown and small, with whiskers.

Grave and round, with neat ears and silky hair.

It was the Water Rat!





Chapter XI "Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears"


The Rat put out a neat little brown paw, gripped Toad firmly by the scruff of the neck, and gave a great hoist and a pull; and the water-logged Toad came up slowly but surely over the edge of the hole, till at last he stood safe and sound in the hall, streaked with mud and weed to be sure, and with the water streaming off him, but happy and high-spirited as of old, now that he found himself once more in the house of a friend, and dodgings and evasions were over, and he could lay aside a disguise that was unworthy of his position and wanted such a lot of living up to.

"O, Ratty!" he cried. "I've been through such times since I saw you last, you can't think! Such trials, such sufferings, and all so nobly borne! Then such escapes, such disguises such subterfuges, and all so cleverly planned and carried out! Been in prison—got out of it, of course! Been thrown into a canal—swam ashore! Stole a horse—sold him for a large sum of money! Humbugged everybody—made 'em all do exactly what I wanted! Oh, I AM a smart Toad, and no mistake! What do you think my last exploit was? Just hold on till I tell you—"

"Toad," said the Water Rat, gravely and firmly, "you go off upstairs at once, and take off that old cotton rag that looks as if it might formerly have belonged to some washerwoman, and clean yourself thoroughly, and put on some of my clothes and try and come down looking like a gentleman if you CAN; for a more shabby, bedraggled, disreputable-looking object than you are I never set eyes on in my whole life! Now, stop swaggering and arguing, and be off! I'll have something to say to you later!"

Toad was at first inclined to stop and do some talking back at him. He had had enough of being ordered about when he was in prison, and here was the thing being begun all over again, apparently; and by a Rat, too! However, he caught sight of himself in the looking-glass over the hat-stand, with the rusty black bonnet perched rakishly over one eye, and he changed his mind and went very quickly and humbly upstairs to the Rat's dressing-room. There he had a thorough wash and brush-up, changed his clothes, and stood for a long time before the glass, contemplating himself with pride and pleasure, and thinking what utter idiots all the people must have been to have ever mistaken him for one moment for a washerwoman.

By the time he came down again luncheon was on the table, and very glad Toad was to see it, for he had been through some trying experiences and had taken much hard exercise since the excellent breakfast provided for him by the gipsy. While they ate Toad told the Rat all his adventures, dwelling chiefly on his own cleverness, and presence of mind in emergencies, and cunning in tight places; and rather making out that he had been having a gay and highly-coloured experience. But the more he talked and boasted, the more grave and silent the Rat became.

When at last Toad had talked himself to a standstill, there was silence for a while; and then the Rat said, "Now, Toady, I don't want to give you pain, after all you've been through already; but seriously, don't you see what an awful ass you've been making of yourself? On your own admission you have been handcuffed, imprisoned, starved, chased, terrified out of your life, insulted, jeered at, and ignominiously flung into the water—by a woman, too! Where's the amusement in that? Where does the fun come in? And all because you must needs go and steal a motor-car. You know that you've never had anything but trouble from motor-cars from the moment you first set eyes on one. But if you WILL be mixed up with them—as you generally are, five minutes after you've started—why STEAL them? Be a cripple, if you think it's exciting; be a bankrupt, for a change, if you've set your mind on it: but why choose to be a convict? When are you going to be sensible, and think of your friends, and try and be a credit to them? Do you suppose it's any pleasure to me, for instance, to hear animals saying, as I go about, that I'm the chap that keeps company with gaol-birds?"

Now, it was a very comforting point in Toad's character that he was a thoroughly good-hearted animal and never minded being jawed by those who were his real friends. And even when most set upon a thing, he was always able to see the other side of the question. So although, while the Rat was talking so seriously, he kept saying to himself mutinously, "But it WAS fun, though! Awful fun!" and making strange suppressed noises inside him, k-i-ck-ck-ck, and poop-p-p, and other sounds resembling stifled snorts, or the opening of soda-water bottles, yet when the Rat had quite finished, he heaved a deep sigh and said, very nicely and humbly, "Quite right, Ratty! How SOUND you always are! Yes, I've been a conceited old ass, I can quite see that; but now I'm going to be a good Toad, and not do it any more. As for motor-cars, I've not been at all so keen about them since my last ducking in that river of yours. The fact is, while I was hanging on to the edge of your hole and getting my breath, I had a sudden idea—a really brilliant idea—connected with motorboats—there, there! don't take on so, old chap, and stamp, and upset things; it was only an idea, and we won't talk any more about it now. We'll have our coffee, AND a smoke, and a quiet chat, and then I'm going to stroll quietly down to Toad Hall, and get into clothes of my own, and set things going again on the old lines. I've had enough of adventures. I shall lead a quiet, steady, respectable life, pottering about my property, and improving it, and doing a little landscape gardening at times. There will always be a bit of dinner for my friends when they come to see me; and I shall keep a pony-chaise to jog about the country in, just as I used to in the good old days, before I got restless, and wanted to DO things."

"Stroll quietly down to Toad Hall?" cried the Rat, greatly excited. "What are you talking about? Do you mean to say you haven't HEARD?"

"Heard what?" said Toad, turning rather pale. "Go on, Ratty! Quick! Don't spare me! What haven't I heard?"

"Do you mean to tell me," shouted the Rat, thumping with his little fist upon the table, "that you've heard nothing about the Stoats and Weasels?"

"What, the Wild Wooders?" cried Toad, trembling in every limb. "No, not a word! What have they been doing?"

"—And how they've been and taken Toad Hall?" continued the Rat.

Toad leaned his elbows on the table, and his chin on his paws; and a large tear welled up in each of his eyes, overflowed and splashed on the table, plop! plop!

"Go on, Ratty," he murmured presently; "tell me all. The worst is over. I am an animal again. I can bear it."

"When you—got—into that—that—trouble of yours," said the Rat, slowly and impressively; "I mean, when you—disappeared from society for a time, over that misunderstanding about a—a machine, you know—"

Toad merely nodded.

"Well, it was a good deal talked about down here, naturally," continued the Rat, "not only along the river-side, but even in the Wild Wood. Animals took sides, as always happens. The River-bankers stuck up for you, and said you had been infamously treated, and there was no justice to be had in the land nowadays. But the Wild Wood animals said hard things, and served you right, and it was time this sort of thing was stopped. And they got very cocky, and went about saying you were done for this time! You would never come back again, never, never!"

Toad nodded once more, keeping silence.

"That's the sort of little beasts they are," the Rat went on. "But Mole and Badger, they stuck out, through thick and thin, that you would come back again soon, somehow. They didn't know exactly how, but somehow!"

Toad began to sit up in his chair again, and to smirk a little.

"They argued from history," continued the Rat. "They said that no criminal laws had ever been known to prevail against cheek and plausibility such as yours, combined with the power of a long purse. So they arranged to move their things into Toad Hall, and sleep there, and keep it aired, and have it all ready for you when you turned up. They didn't guess what was going to happen, of course; still, they had their suspicions of the Wild Wood animals. Now I come to the most painful and tragic part of my story. One dark night—it was a VERY dark night, and blowing hard, too, and raining simply cats and dogs—a band of weasels, armed to the teeth, crept silently up the carriage-drive to the front entrance. Simultaneously, a body of desperate ferrets, advancing through the kitchen-garden, possessed themselves of the backyard and offices; while a company of skirmishing stoats who stuck at nothing occupied the conservatory and the billiard-room, and held the French windows opening on to the lawn.

"The Mole and the Badger were sitting by the fire in the smoking-room, telling stories and suspecting nothing, for it wasn't a night for any animals to be out in, when those bloodthirsty villains broke down the doors and rushed in upon them from every side. They made the best fight they could, but what was the good? They were unarmed, and taken by surprise, and what can two animals do against hundreds? They took and beat them severely with sticks, those two poor faithful creatures, and turned them out into the cold and the wet, with many insulting and uncalled-for remarks!"

Here the unfeeling Toad broke into a snigger, and then pulled himself together and tried to look particularly solemn.

"And the Wild Wooders have been living in Toad Hall ever since," continued the Rat; "and going on simply anyhow! Lying in bed half the day, and breakfast at all hours, and the place in such a mess (I'm told) it's not fit to be seen! Eating your grub, and drinking your drink, and making bad jokes about you, and singing vulgar songs, about—well, about prisons and magistrates, and policemen; horrid personal songs, with no humour in them. And they're telling the tradespeople and everybody that they've come to stay for good."

"O, have they!" said Toad, getting up and seizing a stick. "I'll jolly soon see about that!"

"It's no good, Toad!" called the Rat after him. "You'd better come back and sit down; you'll only get into trouble."

But the Toad was off, and there was no holding him. He marched rapidly down the road, his stick over his shoulder, fuming and muttering to himself in his anger, till he got near his front gate, when suddenly there popped up from behind the palings a long yellow ferret with a gun.

"Who comes there?" said the ferret sharply.

"Stuff and nonsense!" said Toad, very angrily.

"What do you mean by talking like that to me? Come out of that at once, or I'll—"

The ferret said never a word, but he brought his gun up to his shoulder. Toad prudently dropped flat in the road, and BANG! a bullet whistled over his head.

The startled Toad scrambled to his feet and scampered off down the road as hard as he could; and as he ran he heard the ferret laughing, and other horrid thin little laughs taking it up and carrying on the sound.

He went back, very crestfallen, and told the Water Rat.

"What did I tell you?" said the Rat. "It's no good. They've got sentries posted, and they are all armed. You must just wait."

Still, Toad was not inclined to give in all at once. So he got out the boat, and set off rowing up the river to where the garden front of Toad Hall came down to the waterside.

Arriving within sight of his old home, he rested on his oars and surveyed the land cautiously. All seemed very peaceful and deserted and quiet. He could see the whole front of Toad Hall, glowing in the evening sunshine, the pigeons settling by twos and threes along the straight line of the roof; the garden, a blaze of flowers; the creek that led up to the boathouse, the little wooden bridge that crossed it; all tranquil, uninhabited, apparently waiting for his return. He would try the boat-house first, he thought. Very warily he paddled up to the mouth of the creek, and was just passing under the bridge, when... CRASH!

A great stone, dropped from above, smashed through the bottom of the boat. It filled and sank, and Toad found himself struggling in deep water. Looking up, he saw two stoats leaning over the parapet of the bridge and watching him with great glee. "It will be your head next time, Toady!" they called out to him. The indignant Toad swam to shore, while the stoats laughed and laughed, supporting each other, and laughed again, till they nearly had two fits—that is, one fit each, of course.

The Toad retraced his weary way on foot, and related his disappointing experiences to the Water Rat once more.

"Well, WHAT did I tell you?" said the Rat very crossly. "And, now, look here! See what you've been and done! Lost me my boat that I was so fond of, that's what you've done! And simply ruined that nice suit of clothes that I lent you! Really, Toad, of all the trying animals—I wonder you manage to keep any friends at all!"

The Toad saw at once how wrongly and foolishly he had acted. He admitted his errors and wrong-headedness and made a full apology to Rat for losing his boat and spoiling his clothes. And he wound up by saying, with that frank self-surrender which always disarmed his friends' criticism and won them back to his side, "Ratty! I see that I have been a headstrong and a wilful Toad! Henceforth, believe me, I will be humble and submissive, and will take no action without your kind advice and full approval!"

"If that is really so," said the good-natured Rat, already appeased, "then my advice to you is, considering the lateness of the hour, to sit down and have your supper, which will be on the table in a minute, and be very patient. For I am convinced that we can do nothing until we have seen the Mole and the Badger, and heard their latest news, and held conference and taken their advice in this difficult matter."

"Oh, ah, yes, of course, the Mole and the Badger," said Toad lightly. "What's become of them, the dear fellows? I had forgotten all about them."

"Well may you ask!" said the Rat reproachfully. "While you were riding about the country in expensive motor-cars, and galloping proudly on blood-horses, and breakfasting on the fat of the land, those two poor devoted animals have been camping out in the open, in every sort of weather, living very rough by day and lying very hard by night; watching over your house, patrolling your boundaries, keeping a constant eye on the stoats and the weasels, scheming and planning and contriving how to get your property back for you. You don't deserve to have such true and loyal friends, Toad, you don't, really. Some day, when it's too late, you'll be sorry you didn't value them more while you had them!"

"I'm an ungrateful beast, I know," sobbed Toad, shedding bitter tears. "Let me go out and find them, out into the cold, dark night, and share their hardships, and try and prove by—Hold on a bit! Surely I heard the chink of dishes on a tray! Supper's here at last, hooray! Come on, Ratty!"

The Rat remembered that poor Toad had been on prison fare for a considerable time, and that large allowances had therefore to be made. He followed him to the table accordingly, and hospitably encouraged him in his gallant efforts to make up for past privations.

They had just finished their meal and resumed their arm-chairs, when there came a heavy knock at the door.

Toad was nervous, but the Rat, nodding mysteriously at him, went straight up to the door and opened it, and in walked Mr. Badger.

He had all the appearance of one who for some nights had been kept away from home and all its little comforts and conveniences. His shoes were covered with mud, and he was looking very rough and touzled; but then he had never been a very smart man, the Badger, at the best of times. He came solemnly up to Toad, shook him by the paw, and said, "Welcome home, Toad! Alas! what am I saying? Home, indeed! This is a poor homecoming. Unhappy Toad!" Then he turned his back on him, sat down to the table, drew his chair up, and helped himself to a large slice of cold pie.

Toad was quite alarmed at this very serious and portentous style of greeting; but the Rat whispered to him, "Never mind; don't take any notice; and don't say anything to him just yet. He's always rather low and despondent when he's wanting his victuals. In half an hour's time he'll be quite a different animal."

So they waited in silence, and presently there came another and a lighter knock. The Rat, with a nod to Toad, went to the door and ushered in the Mole, very shabby and unwashed, with bits of hay and straw sticking in his fur.

"Hooray! Here's old Toad!" cried the Mole, his face beaming. "Fancy having you back again!" And he began to dance round him. "We never dreamt you would turn up so soon! Why, you must have managed to escape, you clever, ingenious, intelligent Toad!"

The Rat, alarmed, pulled him by the elbow; but it was too late. Toad was puffing and swelling already.

"Clever? O, no!" he said. "I'm not really clever, according to my friends. I've only broken out of the strongest prison in England, that's all! And captured a railway train and escaped on it, that's all! And disguised myself and gone about the country humbugging everybody, that's all! O, no! I'm a stupid ass, I am! I'll tell you one or two of my little adventures, Mole, and you shall judge for yourself!"

"Well, well," said the Mole, moving towards the supper-table; "supposing you talk while I eat. Not a bite since breakfast! O my! O my!" And he sat down and helped himself liberally to cold beef and pickles.

Toad straddled on the hearth-rug, thrust his paw into his trouser-pocket and pulled out a handful of silver. "Look at that!" he cried, displaying it. "That's not so bad, is it, for a few minutes' work? And how do you think I done it, Mole? Horse-dealing! That's how I done it!"

"Go on, Toad," said the Mole, immensely interested.

"Toad, do be quiet, please!" said the Rat. "And don't you egg him on, Mole, when you know what he is; but please tell us as soon as possible what the position is, and what's best to be done, now that Toad is back at last."

"The position's about as bad as it can be," replied the Mole grumpily; "and as for what's to be done, why, blest if I know! The Badger and I have been round and round the place, by night and by day; always the same thing. Sentries posted everywhere, guns poked out at us, stones thrown at us; always an animal on the look-out, and when they see us, my! how they do laugh! That's what annoys me most!"

"It's a very difficult situation," said the Rat, reflecting deeply. "But I think I see now, in the depths of my mind, what Toad really ought to do. I will tell you. He ought to—"

"No, he oughtn't!" shouted the Mole, with his mouth full. "Nothing of the sort! You don't understand. What he ought to do is, he ought to—"

"Well, I shan't do it, anyway!" cried Toad, getting excited. "I'm not going to be ordered about by you fellows! It's my house we're talking about, and I know exactly what to do, and I'll tell you. I'm going to—"

By this time they were all three talking at once, at the top of their voices, and the noise was simply deafening, when a thin, dry voice made itself heard, saying, "Be quiet at once, all of you!" and instantly every one was silent.

It was the Badger, who, having finished his pie, had turned round in his chair and was looking at them severely. When he saw that he had secured their attention, and that they were evidently waiting for him to address them, he turned back to the table again and reached out for the cheese. And so great was the respect commanded by the solid qualities of that admirable animal, that not another word was uttered until he had quite finished his repast and brushed the crumbs from his knees. The Toad fidgeted a good deal, but the Rat held him firmly down.

When the Badger had quite done, he got up from his seat and stood before the fireplace, reflecting deeply. At last he spoke.

"Toad!" he said severely. "You bad, troublesome little animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? What do you think your father, my old friend, would have said if he had been here tonight, and had known of all your goings on?"

Toad, who was on the sofa by this time, with his legs up, rolled over on his face, shaken by sobs of contrition.

"There, there!" went on the Badger, more kindly. "Never mind. Stop crying. We're going to let bygones be bygones, and try and turn over a new leaf. But what the Mole says is quite true. The stoats are on guard, at every point, and they make the best sentinels in the world. It's quite useless to think of attacking the place. They're too strong for us."

"Then it's all over," sobbed the Toad, crying into the sofa cushions. "I shall go and enlist for a soldier, and never see my dear Toad Hall any more!"

"Come, cheer up, Toady!" said the Badger. "There are more ways of getting back a place than taking it by storm. I haven't said my last word yet. Now I'm going to tell you a great secret."

Toad sat up slowly and dried his eyes. Secrets had an immense attraction for him, because he never could keep one, and he enjoyed the sort of unhallowed thrill he experienced when he went and told another animal, after having faithfully promised not to.

"There—is—an—underground—passage," said the Badger impressively, "that leads from the river bank, quite near here, right up into the middle of Toad Hall."

"O, nonsense! Badger," said Toad, rather airily. "You've been listening to some of the yarns they spin in the public-houses about here. I know every inch of Toad Hall, inside and out. Nothing of the sort, I do assure you!"

"My young friend," said the Badger with great severity, "your father, who was a worthy animal—a lot worthier than some others I know—was a particular friend of mine, and told me a great deal he wouldn't have dreamt of telling you. He discovered that passage—he didn't make it, of course; that was done hundreds of years before he ever came to live there—and he repaired it and cleaned it out, because he thought it might come in useful some day, in case of trouble or danger; and he showed it to me. 'Don't let my son know about it,' he said. 'He's a good boy, but very light and volatile in character, and simply cannot hold his tongue. If he's ever in a real fix, and it would be of use to him, you may tell him about the secret passage; but not before.'"

The other animals looked hard at Toad to see how he would take it. Toad was inclined to be sulky at first; but he brightened up immediately, like the good fellow he was.

"Well, well," he said; "perhaps I am a bit of a talker. A popular fellow such as I am—my friends get round me—we chaff, we sparkle, we tell witty stories—and somehow my tongue gets wagging. I have the gift of conversation. I've been told I ought to have a SALON, whatever that may be. Never mind. Go on, Badger. How's this passage of yours going to help us?"

"I've found out a thing or two lately," continued the Badger. "I got Otter to disguise himself as a sweep and call at the back-door with brushes over his shoulder, asking for a job. There's going to be a big banquet tomorrow night. It's somebody's birthday—the Chief Weasel's, I believe—and all the weasels will be gathered together in the dining-hall, eating and drinking and laughing and carrying on, suspecting nothing. No guns, no swords, no sticks, no arms of any sort whatever!"

"But the sentinels will be posted as usual," remarked the Rat.

"Exactly," said the Badger; "that is my point. The weasels will trust entirely to their excellent sentinels. And that is where the passage comes in. That very useful tunnel leads right up under the butler's pantry, next to the dining-hall!"

"Aha! that squeaky board in the butler's pantry!" said Toad. "Now I understand it!"

"We shall creep out quietly into the butler's pantry—" cried the Mole.

"—with our pistols and swords and sticks—" shouted the Rat.

"—and rush in upon them," said the Badger.

"—and whack 'em, and whack 'em, and whack 'em!" cried the Toad in ecstasy, running round and round the room, and jumping over the chairs.

"Very well, then," said the Badger, resuming his usual dry manner, "our plan is settled, and there's nothing more for you to argue and squabble about. So, as it's getting very late, all of you go right off to bed at once. We will make all the necessary arrangements in the course of the morning tomorrow."

Toad, of course, went off to bed dutifully with the rest—he knew better than to refuse—though he was feeling much too excited to sleep. But he had had a long day, with many events crowded into it; and sheets and blankets were very friendly and comforting things, after plain straw, and not too much of it, spread on the stone floor of a draughty cell; and his head had not been many seconds on his pillow before he was snoring happily. Naturally, he dreamt a good deal; about roads that ran away from him just when he wanted them, and canals that chased him and caught him, and a barge that sailed into the banqueting-hall with his week's washing, just as he was giving a dinner-party; and he was alone in the secret passage, pushing onwards, but it twisted and turned round and shook itself, and sat up on its end; yet somehow, at the last, he found himself back in Toad Hall, safe and triumphant, with all his friends gathered round about him, earnestly assuring him that he really was a clever Toad.

He slept till a late hour next morning, and by the time he got down he found that the other animals had finished their breakfast some time before. The Mole had slipped off somewhere by himself, without telling any one where he was going to. The Badger sat in the arm-chair, reading the paper, and not concerning himself in the slightest about what was going to happen that very evening. The Rat, on the other hand, was running round the room busily, with his arms full of weapons of every kind, distributing them in four little heaps on the floor, and saying excitedly under his breath, as he ran, "Here's-a-sword-for-the-Rat, here's-a-sword-for-the-Mole, here's-a-sword-for-the-Toad, here's-a-sword-for-the-Badger! Here's-a-pistol-for-the-Rat, here's-a-pistol-for-the-Mole, here's-a-pistol-for-the-Toad, here's-a-pistol-for-the-Badger!" And so on, in a regular rhythmical way, while the four little heaps gradually grew and grew.

"That's all very well, Rat," said the Badger presently, looking at the busy little animal over the edge of his newspaper; "I'm not blaming you. But just let us once get past the stoats, with those detestable guns of theirs, and I assure you we shan't want any swords or pistols. We four, with our sticks, once we're inside the dining-hall, why, we shall clear the floor of all the lot of them in five minutes. I'd have done the whole thing by myself, only I didn't want to deprive you fellows of the fun!"

"It's as well to be on the safe side," said the Rat reflectively, polishing a pistol-barrel on his sleeve and looking along it.

The Toad, having finished his breakfast, picked up a stout stick and swung it vigorously, belabouring imaginary animals. "I'll learn 'em to steal my house!" he cried. "I'll learn 'em, I'll learn 'em!"

"Don't say 'Learn 'em,' Toad," said the Rat, greatly shocked. "It's not good English."

"What are you always nagging at Toad for?" inquired the Badger rather peevishly. "What's the matter with his English? It's the same what I use myself, and if it's good enough for me, it ought to be good enough for you!"

"I'm very sorry," said the Rat humbly. "Only I THINK it ought to be 'teach 'em,' not 'learn 'em.'"

"But we don't WANT to teach 'em," replied the Badger. "We want to LEARN 'em—learn 'em, learn 'em! And what's more, we're going to DO it, too!"

"O, very well, have it your own way," said the Rat. He was getting rather muddled about it himself, and presently he retired into a corner, where he could be heard muttering, "Learn 'em, teach 'em, teach 'em, learn'em!" till the Badger told him rather sharply to leave off.

Presently the Mole came tumbling into the room, evidently very pleased with himself. "I've been having such fun!" he began at once; "I've been getting a rise out of the stoats!"

"I hope you've been very careful, Mole?" said the Rat anxiously.

"I should hope so, too," said the Mole confidently. "I got the idea when I went into the kitchen, to see about Toad's breakfast being kept hot for him. I found that old washerwoman-dress that he came home in yesterday hanging on a towel-horse before the fire. So I put it on, and the bonnet as well, and the shawl, and off I went to Toad Hall, as bold as you please. The sentries were on the look-out, of course, with their guns and their 'Who comes there?' and all the rest of their nonsense. 'Good morning, gentlemen!' says I, very respectful. 'Want any washing done today?'

"They looked at me very proud and stiff and haughty, and said, 'Go away, washerwoman! We don't do any washing on duty.' 'Or any other time?' says I. Ho, ho, ho! Wasn't I FUNNY, Toad?"

"Poor, frivolous animal!" said Toad, very loftily. The fact is, he felt exceedingly jealous of Mole for what he had just done. It was exactly what he would have liked to have done himself, if only he had thought of it first, and hadn't gone and overslept himself.

"Some of the stoats turned quite pink," continued the Mole, "and the sergeant in charge, he said to me, very short, he said, 'Now run away, my good woman, run away! Don't keep my men idling and talking on their posts.' 'Run away?' says I; 'it won't be me that'll be running away, in a very short time from now!'"

"O MOLY, how could you?" said the Rat, dismayed.

The Badger laid down his paper.

"I could see them pricking up their ears and looking at each other," went on the Mole; "and the sergeant said to them, 'Never mind HER; she doesn't know what she's talking about.'"

"'O! don't I?' said I. 'Well, let me tell you this. My daughter, she washes for Mr. Badger, and that'll show you whether I know what I'm talking about; and YOU'LL know pretty soon, too! A hundred bloodthirsty Badgers, armed with rifles, are going to attack Toad Hall this very night, by way of the paddock. Six boat-loads of Rats, with pistols and cutlasses, will come up the river and effect a landing in the garden; while a picked body of Toads, known at the Die-hards, or the Death-or-Glory Toads, will storm the orchard and carry everything before them, yelling for vengeance. There won't be much left of you to wash, by the time they've done with you, unless you clear out while you have the chance!' Then I ran away, and when I was out of sight I hid; and presently I came creeping back along the ditch and took a peep at them through the hedge. They were all as nervous and flustered as could be, running all ways at once, and falling over each other, and every one giving orders to everybody else and not listening; and the sergeant kept sending off parties of stoats to distant parts of the grounds, and then sending other fellows to fetch 'em back again; and I heard them saying to each other, 'That's JUST like the weasels; they're to stop comfortably in the banqueting-hall, and have feasting and toasts and songs and all sorts of fun, while we must stay on guard in the cold and the dark, and in the end be cut to pieces by bloodthirsty Badgers!'"

"O, you silly ass, Mole!" cried Toad, "You've been and spoilt everything!"

"Mole," said the Badger, in his dry, quiet way, "I perceive you have more sense in your little finger than some other animals have in the whole of their fat bodies. You have managed excellently, and I begin to have great hopes of you. Good Mole! Clever Mole!"

The Toad was simply wild with jealousy, more especially as he couldn't make out for the life of him what the Mole had done that was so particularly clever; but, fortunately for him, before he could show temper or expose himself to the Badger's sarcasm, the bell rang for luncheon.

It was a simple but sustaining meal—bacon and broad beans, and a macaroni pudding; and when they had quite done, the Badger settled himself into an arm-chair, and said, "Well, we've got our work cut out for us tonight, and it will probably be pretty late before we're quite through with it; so I'm just going to take forty winks, while I can." And he drew a handkerchief over his face and was soon snoring.

The anxious and laborious Rat at once resumed his preparations, and started running between his four little heaps, muttering, "Here's-a-belt-for-the-Rat, here's-a-belt-for-the Mole, here's-a-belt-for-the-Toad, here's-a-belt-for-the-Badger!" and so on, with every fresh accoutrement he produced, to which there seemed really no end; so the Mole drew his arm through Toad's, led him out into the open air, shoved him into a wicker chair, and made him tell him all his adventures from beginning to end, which Toad was only too willing to do. The Mole was a good listener, and Toad, with no one to check his statements or to criticise in an unfriendly spirit, rather let himself go. Indeed, much that he related belonged more properly to the category of what-might-have-happened-had-I-only-thought-of-it-in-time-instead-of-ten-minutes-afterwards. Those are always the best and the raciest adventures; and why should they not be truly ours, as much as the somewhat inadequate things that really come off?





Chapter XII The Return of Ulysses


When it began to grow dark, the Rat, with an air of excitement and mystery, summoned them back into the parlour, stood each of them up alongside of his little heap, and proceeded to dress them up for the coming expedition. He was very earnest and thoroughgoing about it, and the affair took quite a long time. First, there was a belt to go round each animal, and then a sword to be stuck into each belt, and then a cutlass on the other side to balance it. Then a pair of pistols, a policeman's truncheon, several sets of handcuffs, some bandages and sticking-plaster, and a flask and a sandwich-case. The Badger laughed good-humouredly and said, "All right, Ratty! It amuses you and it doesn't hurt me. I'm going to do all I've got to do with this here stick." But the Rat only said, "PLEASE, Badger. You know I shouldn't like you to blame me afterwards and say I had forgotten ANYTHING!"

When all was quite ready, the Badger took a dark lantern in one paw, grasped his great stick with the other, and said, "Now then, follow me! Mole first, 'cos I'm very pleased with him; Rat next; Toad last. And look here, Toady! Don't you chatter so much as usual, or you'll be sent back, as sure as fate!"

The Toad was so anxious not to be left out that he took up the inferior position assigned to him without a murmur, and the animals set off. The Badger led them along by the river for a little way, and then suddenly swung himself over the edge into a hole in the river bank, a little above the water. The Mole and the Rat followed silently, swinging themselves successfully into the hole as they had seen the Badger do; but when it came to Toad's turn, of course he managed to slip and fall into the water with a loud splash and a squeal of alarm. He was hauled out by his friends, rubbed down and wrung out hastily, comforted, and set on his legs; but the Badger was seriously angry, and told him that the very next time he made a fool of himself he would most certainly be left behind.

So at last they were in the secret passage, and the cutting-out expedition had really begun!

It was cold, and dark, and damp, and low, and narrow, and poor Toad began to shiver, partly from dread of what might be before him, partly because he was wet through. The lantern was far ahead, and he could not help lagging behind a little in the darkness. Then he heard the Rat call out warningly, "COME on, Toad!" and a terror seized him of being left behind, alone in the darkness, and he "came on" with such a rush that he upset the Rat into the Mole and the Mole into the Badger, and for a moment all was confusion. The Badger thought they were being attacked from behind, and, as there was no room to use a stick or a cutlass, drew a pistol, and was on the point of putting a bullet into Toad. When he found out what had really happened he was very angry indeed, and said, "Now this time that tiresome Toad SHALL be left behind!"

But Toad whimpered, and the other two promised that they would be answerable for his good conduct, and at last the Badger was pacified, and the procession moved on; only this time the Rat brought up the rear, with a firm grip on the shoulder of Toad.

So they groped and shuffled along, with their ears pricked up and their paws on their pistols, till at last the Badger said, "We ought by now to be pretty nearly under the Hall."

Then suddenly they heard, far away as it might be, and yet apparently nearly over their heads, a confused murmur of sound, as if people were shouting and cheering and stamping on the floor and hammering on tables. The Toad's nervous terrors all returned, but the Badger only remarked placidly, "They ARE going it, the weasels!"

The passage now began to slope upwards; they groped onward a little further, and then the noise broke out again, quite distinct this time, and very close above them. "Ooo-ray-ooray-oo-ray-ooray!" they heard, and the stamping of little feet on the floor, and the clinking of glasses as little fists pounded on the table. "WHAT a time they're having!" said the Badger. "Come on!" They hurried along the passage till it came to a full stop, and they found themselves standing under the trap-door that led up into the butler's pantry.

Such a tremendous noise was going on in the banqueting-hall that there was little danger of their being overheard. The Badger said, "Now, boys, all together!" and the four of them put their shoulders to the trap-door and heaved it back. Hoisting each other up, they found themselves standing in the pantry, with only a door between them and the banqueting-hall, where their unconscious enemies were carousing.

The noise, as they emerged from the passage, was simply deafening. At last, as the cheering and hammering slowly subsided, a voice could be made out saying, "Well, I do not propose to detain you much longer" —(great applause)—"but before I resume my seat" —(renewed cheering)—"I should like to say one word about our kind host, Mr. Toad. We all know Toad!" —(great laughter)—"GOOD Toad, MODEST Toad, HONEST Toad!" (shrieks of merriment).

"Only just let me get at him!" muttered Toad, grinding his teeth.

"Hold hard a minute!" said the Badger, restraining him with difficulty. "Get ready, all of you!"

"—Let me sing you a little song," went on the voice, "Which I have composed on the subject of Toad" —(prolonged applause).

Then the Chief Weasel—for it was he—began in a high, squeaky voice—





"Toad he went a-pleasuring

Gaily down the street—"





The Badger drew himself up, took a firm grip of his stick with both paws, glanced round at his comrades, and cried—

"The hour is come! Follow me!"

And flung the door open wide.

My!

What a squealing and a squeaking and a screeching filled the air!

Well might the terrified weasels dive under the tables and spring madly up at the windows! Well might the ferrets rush wildly for the fireplace and get hopelessly jammed in the chimney! Well might tables and chairs be upset, and glass and china be sent crashing on the floor, in the panic of that terrible moment when the four Heroes strode wrathfully into the room! The mighty Badger, his whiskers bristling, his great cudgel whistling through the air; Mole, black and grim, brandishing his stick and shouting his awful war-cry, "A Mole! A Mole!" Rat, desperate and determined, his belt bulging with weapons of every age and every variety; Toad, frenzied with excitement and injured pride, swollen to twice his ordinary size, leaping into the air and emitting Toad-whoops that chilled them to the marrow! "Toad he went a-pleasuring!" he yelled. "I'LL pleasure 'em!" and he went straight for the Chief Weasel. They were but four in all, but to the panic-stricken weasels the hall seemed full of monstrous animals, grey, black, brown and yellow, whooping and flourishing enormous cudgels; and they broke and fled with squeals of terror and dismay, this way and that, through the windows, up the chimney, anywhere to get out of reach of those terrible sticks.

The affair was soon over. Up and down, the whole length of the hall, strode the four Friends, whacking with their sticks at every head that showed itself; and in five minutes the room was cleared. Through the broken windows the shrieks of terrified weasels escaping across the lawn were borne faintly to their ears; on the floor lay prostrate some dozen or so of the enemy, on whom the Mole was busily engaged in fitting handcuffs. The Badger, resting from his labours, leant on his stick and wiped his honest brow.

"Mole," he said, "you're the best of fellows! Just cut along outside and look after those stoat-sentries of yours, and see what they're doing. I've an idea that, thanks to you, we shan't have much trouble from THEM tonight!"

The Mole vanished promptly through a window; and the Badger bade the other two set a table on its legs again, pick up knives and forks and plates and glasses from the débris on the floor, and see if they could find materials for a supper. "I want some grub, I do," he said, in that rather common way he had of speaking. "Stir your stumps, Toad, and look lively! We've got your house back for you, and you don't offer us so much as a sandwich."

Toad felt rather hurt that the Badger didn't say pleasant things to him, as he had to the Mole, and tell him what a fine fellow he was, and how splendidly he had fought; for he was rather particularly pleased with himself and the way he had gone for the Chief Weasel and sent him flying across the table with one blow of his stick. But he bustled about, and so did the Rat, and soon they found some guava jelly in a glass dish, and a cold chicken, a tongue that had hardly been touched, some trifle, and quite a lot of lobster salad; and in the pantry they came upon a basketful of French rolls and any quantity of cheese, butter, and celery. They were just about to sit down when the Mole clambered in through the window, chuckling, with an armful of rifles.

"It's all over," he reported. "From what I can make out, as soon as the stoats, who were very nervous and jumpy already, heard the shrieks and the yells and the uproar inside the hall, some of them threw down their rifles and fled. The others stood fast for a bit, but when the weasels came rushing out upon them they thought they were betrayed; and the stoats grappled with the weasels, and the weasels fought to get away, and they wrestled and wriggled and punched each other, and rolled over and over, till most of 'em rolled into the river! They've all disappeared by now, one way or another; and I've got their rifles. So THAT'S all right!"

"Excellent and deserving animal!" said the Badger, his mouth full of chicken and trifle. "Now, there's just one more thing I want you to do, Mole, before you sit down to your supper along of us; and I wouldn't trouble you only I know I can trust you to see a thing done, and I wish I could say the same of every one I know. I'd send Rat, if he wasn't a poet. I want you to take those fellows on the floor there upstairs with you, and have some bedrooms cleaned out and tidied up and made really comfortable. See that they sweep UNDER the beds, and put clean sheets and pillow-cases on, and turn down one corner of the bed-clothes, just as you know it ought to be done; and have a can of hot water, and clean towels, and fresh cakes of soap, put in each room. And then you can give them a licking apiece, if it's any satisfaction to you, and put them out by the back door, and we shan't see any more of THEM, I fancy. And then come along and have some of this cold tongue. It's first-rate. I'm very pleased with you, Mole!"

The good-natured Mole picked up a stick, formed his prisoners up in a line on the floor, gave them the order "Quick march!" and led his squad off to the upper floor. After a time, he appeared again, smiling, and said that every room was ready, and as clean as a new pin. "And I didn't have to lick them, either," he added. "I thought, on the whole, they had had licking enough for one night, and the weasels, when I put the point to them, quite agreed with me, and said they wouldn't think of troubling me. They were very penitent, and said they were extremely sorry for what they had done, but it was all the fault of the Chief Weasel and the stoats, and if ever they could do anything for us at any time to make up, we had only got to mention it. So I gave them a roll apiece, and let them out at the back, and off they ran, as hard as they could!"

Then the Mole pulled his chair up to the table, and pitched into the cold tongue; and Toad, like the gentleman he was, put all his jealousy from him, and said heartily, "Thank you kindly, dear Mole, for all your pains and trouble tonight, and especially for your cleverness this morning!" The Badger was pleased at that, and said, "There spoke my brave Toad!" So they finished their supper in great joy and contentment, and presently retired to rest between clean sheets, safe in Toad's ancestral home, won back by matchless valour, consummate strategy, and a proper handling of sticks.

The following morning, Toad, who had overslept himself as usual, came down to breakfast disgracefully late, and found on the table a certain quantity of egg-shells, some fragments of cold and leathery toast, a coffee-pot three-fourths empty, and really very little else; which did not tend to improve his temper, considering that, after all, it was his own house. Through the French windows of the breakfast-room he could see the Mole and the Water Rat sitting in wicker chairs out on the lawn, evidently telling each other stories; roaring with laughter and kicking their short legs up in the air. The Badger, who was in an arm-chair and deep in the morning paper, merely looked up and nodded when Toad entered the room. But Toad knew his man, so he sat down and made the best breakfast he could, merely observing to himself that he would get square with the others sooner or later. When he had nearly finished, the Badger looked up and remarked rather shortly: "I'm sorry, Toad, but I'm afraid there's a heavy morning's work in front of you. You see, we really ought to have a Banquet at once, to celebrate this affair. It's expected of you—in fact, it's the rule."

"O, all right!" said the Toad readily. "Anything to oblige. Though why on earth you should want to have a Banquet in the morning I cannot understand. But you know I do not live to please myself, but merely to find out what my friends want, and then try and arrange it for 'em, you dear old Badger!"

"Don't pretend to be stupider than you really are," replied the Badger, crossly; "and don't chuckle and splutter in your coffee while you're talking; it's not manners. What I mean is, the Banquet will be at night, of course, but the invitations will have to be written and got off at once, and you've got to write 'em. Now, sit down at that table—there's stacks of letter-paper on it, with 'Toad Hall' at the top in blue and gold—and write invitations to all our friends, and if you stick to it we shall get them out before luncheon. And I'LL bear a hand, too; and take my share of the burden. I'LL order the Banquet."

"What!" cried Toad, dismayed. "Me stop indoors and write a lot of rotten letters on a jolly morning like this, when I want to go around my property, and set everything and everybody to rights, and swagger about and enjoy myself! Certainly not! I'll be—I'll see you—stop a minute, though! Why, of course, dear Badger! What is my pleasure or convenience compared with that of others! You wish it done, and it shall be done. Go, Badger, order the Banquet, order what you like; then join our young friends outside in their innocent mirth, oblivious of me and my cares and toils. I sacrifice this fair morning on the altar of duty and friendship!"

The Badger looked at him very suspiciously, but Toad's frank, open countenance made it difficult to suggest any unworthy motive in this change of attitude. He quitted the room, accordingly, in the direction of the kitchen, and as soon as the door had closed behind him, Toad hurried to the writing-table. A fine idea had occurred to him while he was talking. He WOULD write the invitations; and he would take care to mention the leading part he had taken in the fight, and how he had laid the Chief Weasel flat; and he would hint at his adventures, and what a career of triumph he had to tell about; and on the fly-leaf he would set out a sort of a programme of entertainment for the evening—something like this, as he sketched it out in his head:—





SPEECH BY TOAD

(There will be other speeches by TOAD during the evening.)

ADDRESS BY TOAD

SYNOPSIS—Our Prison System—the Waterways of Old England—

Horse-dealing, and how to deal—Property, its rights and its duties—

SONG BY TOAD

(Composed by himself.)

OTHER COMPOSITIONS BY TOAD

will be sung in the course of the evening by the… COMPOSER.





The idea pleased him mightily, and he worked very hard and got all the letters finished by noon, at which hour it was reported to him that there was a small and rather bedraggled weasel at the door, inquiring timidly whether he could be of any service to the gentlemen. Toad swaggered out and found it was one of the prisoners of the previous evening, very respectful and anxious to please. He patted him on the head, shoved the bundle of invitations into his paw, and told him to cut along quick and deliver them as fast as he could, and if he liked to come back again in the evening perhaps there might be a shilling for him, or, again, perhaps there mightn't; and the poor weasel seemed really quite grateful, and hurried off eagerly to do his mission.

When the other animals came back to luncheon, very boisterous and breezy after a morning on the river, the Mole, whose conscience had been pricking him, looked doubtfully at Toad, expecting to find him sulky or depressed. Instead, he was so uppish and inflated that the Mole began to suspect something; while the Rat and the Badger exchanged significant glances.

As soon as the meal was over, Toad thrust his paws deep into his trouser pockets, remarked casually, "Well, look after yourselves, you fellows! Ask for anything you want!" and was swaggering off in the direction of the garden, where he wanted to think out an idea or two for his coming speeches, when the Rat caught him by the arm.

Toad rather suspected what he was after, and did his best to get away; but when the Badger took him firmly by the other arm he began to see that the game was up. The two animals conducted him between them into the small smoking-room that opened out of the entrance-hall, shut the door, and put him into a chair. Then they both stood in front of him, while Toad sat silent and regarded them with much suspicion and ill-humour.

"Now, look here, Toad," said the Rat. "It's about this Banquet, and very sorry I am to have to speak to you like this. But we want you to understand clearly, once and for all, that there are going to be no speeches and no songs. Try and grasp the fact that on this occasion we're not arguing with you; we're just telling you."

Toad saw that he was trapped. They understood him, they saw through him, they had got ahead of him. His pleasant dream was shattered.

"Mayn't I sing them just one LITTLE song?" he pleaded piteously.

"No, not ONE little song," replied the Rat firmly, though his heart bled as he noticed the trembling lip of the poor disappointed Toad. "It's no good, Toady; you know well that your songs are all conceit and boasting and vanity; and your speeches are all self-praise and—and—well, and gross exaggeration and—and—"

"And gas," put in the Badger, in his common way.

"It's for your own good, Toady," went on the Rat. "You know you MUST turn over a new leaf sooner or later, and now seems a splendid time to begin; a sort of turning-point in your career. Please don't think that saying all this doesn't hurt me more than it hurts you."

Toad remained a long while plunged in thought. At last he raised his head, and the traces of strong emotion were visible on his features. "You have conquered, my friends," he said in broken accents. "It was, to be sure, but a small thing that I asked—merely leave to blossom and expand for yet one more evening, to let myself go and hear the tumultuous applause that always seems to me—somehow—to bring out my best qualities. However, you are right, I know, and I am wrong. Henceforth I will be a very different Toad. My friends, you shall never have occasion to blush for me again. But, O dear, O dear, this is a hard world!"

And, pressing his handkerchief to his face, he left the room with faltering footsteps.

"Badger," said the Rat, "I feel like a brute; I wonder what YOU feel like?"

"O, I know, I know," said the Badger gloomily. "But the thing had to be done. This good fellow has got to live here, and hold his own, and be respected. Would you have him a common laughing-stock, mocked and jeered at by stoats and weasels?"

"Of course not," said the Rat. "And, talking of weasels, it's lucky we came upon that little weasel, just as he was setting out with Toad's invitations. I suspected something from what you told me, and had a look at one or two; they were simply disgraceful. I confiscated the lot, and the good Mole is now sitting in the blue boudoir, filling up plain, simple invitation cards."





At last the hour for the banquet began to draw near, and Toad, who on leaving the others had retired to his bedroom, was still sitting there, melancholy and thoughtful. His brow resting on his paw, he pondered long and deeply. Gradually his countenance cleared, and he began to smile long, slow smiles. Then he took to giggling in a shy, self-conscious manner. At last he got up, locked the door, drew the curtains across the windows, collected all the chairs in the room and arranged them in a semicircle, and took up his position in front of them, swelling visibly. Then he bowed, coughed twice, and, letting himself go, with uplifted voice he sang, to the enraptured audience that his imagination so clearly saw,





TOAD'S LAST LITTLE SONG!





The Toad—came—home!

There was panic in the parlour and howling in the hall,

There was crying in the cow-shed and shrieking in the stall,

When the Toad—came—home!





When the Toad—came—home!

There was smashing in of window and crashing in of door,

There was chivvying of weasels that fainted on the floor,

When the Toad—came—home!





Bang! go the drums!

The trumpeters are tooting and the soldiers are saluting,

And the cannon they are shooting and the motor-cars are hooting,

As the—Hero—comes!





Shout—Hooray!

And let each one of the crowd try and shout it very loud,

In honour of an animal of whom you're justly proud,

For it's Toad's—great—day!





He sang this very loud, with great unction and expression; and when he had done, he sang it all over again.

Then he heaved a deep sigh; a long, long, long sigh.

Then he dipped his hair-brush in the water-jug, parted his hair in the middle, and plastered it down very straight and sleek on each side of his face; and, unlocking the door, went quietly down the stairs to greet his guests, who he knew must be assembling in the drawing-room.

All the animals cheered when he entered, and crowded round to congratulate him and say nice things about his courage, and his cleverness, and his fighting qualities; but Toad only smiled faintly, and murmured, "Not at all!" Or, sometimes, for a change, "On the contrary!" Otter, who was standing on the hearthrug, describing to an admiring circle of friends exactly how he would have managed things had he been there, came forward with a shout, threw his arm round Toad's neck, and tried to take him round the room in triumphal progress; but Toad, in a mild way, was rather snubby to him, remarking gently, as he disengaged himself, "Badger's was the mastermind; the Mole and the Water Rat bore the brunt of the fighting; I merely served in the ranks and did little or nothing." The animals were evidently puzzled and taken aback by this unexpected attitude of his; and Toad felt, as he moved from one guest to the other, making his modest responses, that he was an object of absorbing interest to everyone.

The Badger had ordered everything of the best, and the banquet was a great success. There was much talking and laughter and chaff among the animals, but through it all Toad, who of course was in the chair, looked down his nose and murmured pleasant nothings to the animals on either side of him. At intervals he stole a glance at the Badger and the Rat, and always when he looked they were staring at each other with their mouths open; and this gave him the greatest satisfaction. Some of the younger and livelier animals, as the evening wore on, got whispering to each other that things were not so amusing as they used to be in the good old days; and there were some knockings on the table and cries of "Toad! Speech! Speech from Toad! Song! Mr. Toad's Song!" But Toad only shook his head gently, raised one paw in mild protest, and, by pressing delicacies on his guests, by topical small-talk, and by earnest inquiries after members of their families not yet old enough to appear at social functions, managed to convey to them that this dinner was being run on strictly conventional lines.

He was indeed an altered Toad!

After this climax, the four animals continued to lead their lives, so rudely broken in upon by civil war, in great joy and contentment, undisturbed by further risings or invasions. Toad, after due consultation with his friends, selected a handsome gold chain and locket set with pearls, which he dispatched to the gaoler's daughter with a letter that even the Badger admitted to be modest, grateful, and appreciative; and the engine-driver, in his turn, was properly thanked and compensated for all his pains and trouble. Under severe compulsion from the Badger, even the barge-woman was, with some trouble, sought out and the value of her horse discreetly made good to her; though Toad kicked terribly at this, holding himself to be an instrument of Fate, sent to punish fat women with mottled arms who couldn't tell a real gentleman when they saw one. The amount involved, it was true, was not very burdensome, the gipsy's valuation being admitted by local assessors to be approximately correct.

Sometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the friends would take a stroll together in the Wild Wood, now successfully tamed so far as they were concerned; and it was pleasing to see how respectfully they were greeted by the inhabitants, and how the mother-weasels would bring their young ones to the mouths of their holes, and say, pointing, "Look, baby! There goes the great Mr. Toad! And that's the gallant Water Rat, a terrible fighter, walking along o' him! And yonder comes the famous Mr. Mole, of whom you so often have heard your father tell!" But when their infants were fractious and quite beyond control, they would quiet them by telling how, if they didn't hush them and not fret them, the terrible grey Badger would up and get them. This was a base libel on Badger, who, though he cared little about Society, was rather fond of children; but it never failed to have its full effect.
