老屋子（英文版）







序言　写给第一版丹麦语版（匿名）


我，这本书的作者，很年轻、漂亮、富有，也很哀伤。

在我年轻的人生里，充满了恐惧。面对巨额财富，我也不知道如何处理。我的悲伤整日在我的耳边唱着同样的歌曲。这歌声在我裙摆里沙沙作响，在我胸中芬芳的花丛里叹息。漫漫长夜，我坐在床边，一遍遍推开那带着殷切期盼眼神的梦。

现在，我已写完的一切都不再真实。

在我写的当下，一切都是真实的；而现在，这一切都变得虚无。当我看到一切码成铅字，跃然纸上，我知道，我的青春就是我的力量和我的权利；我也知道，如果我面目丑陋，生来贫穷，我则无法存活。

现在，我很开心、知足。

这是我现在的状态。

但我不打算更改我所写下的词语，因为我知道，那样的时刻即将到来——很快——那一切都将又变成现实……直到再次成为虚无。

我的书会继续扩展，经历和平和动荡的年代，直到我再次成为现在的我。

但这本身也可能是个谎言。因为我一直都是我自己。

可是，会有他（上帝）看清我的那一天到来，那时候，我的书就会结束。因为那之后的事情，和其他书里的故事就没什么两样了，而且我也不太记得之后的事情。

尽管如此，这世界确实存在一间屋子，在那里，幸福之光在我眼前闪耀。然后，那光熄灭了，屋子的门也随之关上。

如果有任何人，基于我所写的，认为我是一个十恶不赦的卑鄙罪人，他一点儿都没错。但如果他认为我被这世界抛弃了，那他就大错特错了。

因为我跟别人一样能够昂首挺胸、心中充满平静地走在路上，且被最优秀的人爱戴。在高高的大厅里，灯光流泻在我的发丝上；男人用他们的欲望向我致敬，而女人则只赠予我她们的恶意。

他们之中，只有一个知道我的罪过，那个人诅咒我。

因为待在满是灯光的屋子里的是他，而那个走到大街上的她则是我。





第一部分　科特





第一章


从那屋子看出去便是广场，那广场如此巨大华丽以至于压根没人在那儿做生意。

白天的时候，在屋子里可以听到马车的声音，但这声响非常遥远，因为这屋子所在的房子远离街道，而且它的墙壁像城堡那样厚。傍晚，广场上闪耀起千盏灯光，夜里，你能听到喷泉的潺潺流水声，不知何时开始，也不知何时结束；还有哭声，没有人知道是谁在哭；更有孤独的脚步，来回交替。

屋子的位置比广场高出不少。它的窗户是一扇门，通向满是红色花朵的阳台。当风吹过，花朵的花瓣正好飞进广场的喷泉，在池水里起舞。

屋子又长又深。

有窗户的地方，阳光会穿过镶着有色玻璃的宽大窗格淌入房间；然而，房间里，那壁炉通向天花板的地方，却总是黑暗的。

从未有人见过窗户前的窗帘被拉开过。即使是太阳能直晒房间的时候，也从未有人出现在房间里。白天，这房间是死的。

屋子在这房子里的位置如此奇怪，看上去好像根本不是房子的一部分。日常生活在它之外展开；即使当整个房子都灯火通明，门前的马匹不断地刨着地面，玻璃杯叮叮当当，音乐声在庞大的会客厅回荡，那房间的门却依旧紧紧闭着。

除了这房子的主人和他的妻子，还有那最老的仆人之外，从来没人踏入过它的门槛。

因为这间屋子是这房子的灵魂，是这房子的传统和密室。

很早之前，建这房子的人给这间屋子预设了这样的用处。而且，他很聪明地做到不让人发现那里有间屋子，除非那人事先知道。当工程完成后，他让设计师起誓不泄露这个秘密，并给了设计师一笔丰厚的酬金，设计师遵守了他的誓言。

这房子的建造者按当时的方法极尽奢华地装饰着这屋子，不仅镀了金，还配备了有图饰的皮帘子，镶着有色玻璃的窗格，和昂贵的东方地毯。但他一直也没有摆放任何家具，直到最后，他带来两把从米兰定制的精致的扶手椅。

这两把椅子样子奇怪。它们可以在地面上自如地滑动，就连小孩子都能挪动。它们非常巨大，人坐在椅子里会显得很渺小。椅子的木制部分都被雕刻上鸟和其他动物，这些雕像的脸在黑暗中会露出奇怪的笑容，而当灯点亮时，这些笑容又都消失了。

当一切都布置到位以后，房子的主人叫来一位自幼住在这房子里的老仆人，并给了他一把这屋子的钥匙，让他虔诚地照顾这间屋子。每个傍晚，当黄昏来临，老仆人要点燃壁炉架上的蜡烛，即便他知道他的主人在远方旅行，老仆人也必须这样做。每个早晨，老仆人都要亲自整理屋子。除了老仆人，没人进入过这屋子。

房子的主人在正式拥有这房子的那天晚上，第一次带他妻子参观了房子，最后，他带她来到这间屋子。

妻子惊喜地环顾着屋子。她的丈夫让她坐在其中一把大椅子里，然后他坐在另外一把里，对她说：

“亲爱的，这间屋子是留给你和我的，不给世界上任何其他人。我把它设置在房子最隐蔽的位置，远离我们工作的账房，远离仆人们走来走去的走廊，远离我们会见客人的客厅，甚至远离我们的婚房，在这儿你将睡在我的身边。”

她拉起他的手，吻了吻，然后看着他。

“这将是我们婚姻的神殿，我们伟大的爱情使之神圣。在这儿，我们会向上帝祈祷，是他把我们带给彼此。在这儿，每个我们心灵相交的晚上，我们会开心真诚地交谈。当我们死去后，我们的儿子将带着他的妻子来到这里，继续做我们做过的事情。”

于是，房子的主人将这一切都记录在一个文件里，然后他和妻子共同密封了这个文件，并在封口处写下各自的名字。房主把这文件藏在墙里的一个秘密壁龛里。当这些全部完成，他们面对面跪下，紧握对方双手，向上帝进行了简单的祷告，之后便去休息了。

以上所讲的这对夫妻早已离开人世。但他们的儿子、儿子的儿子以及后代们都遵守了他们的遗愿，直到现在。

且不论这个家族财富如何变化，地产增加或减少，他们都一直拥有这所建在广场上的老房子。因为不管每一代房子的主人是如何生活的，他都会保住这栋祖宅。

那间屋子仍然保持原样，正如最初设计的那样，那个藏在墙洞里的文件开始褪色泛黄。每一代房子的主人一生中仅取出这份文件一次，那就是他第一次带他年轻的妻子来这间密室的晚上。之后，他们把自己的名字写在上面，继而把这文件放回原处。

但每一代房子的法定主人都习惯依据自己的品位脾性在这间屋子里添置一件家具。这些添置的家具在那个时期也都非常奇怪，围聚在那两把大而奇特的椅子旁。

有一位房子的主人，是一位一生和蔼可亲的人。他以他妻子的名义，将一架昂贵的、镶嵌着华丽饰品的纺车摆设在屋子里。这个纺车夜夜欢快地呼啦呼啦地飞转，这样进行了好多年。如今它依旧摆在那里，纺锤上还缠着线。

还有一位主人，他的脑子永远在天外遨游，从不安定，不过他死前变得糊涂了不少。他给这屋子带来一个精巧的天空系统模拟仪。当按键被按下之后，星体就亮了起来，沿着它们永恒的轨道前进。他就这样坐在那里摆弄他的星星，直到他生命的最后一刻。

还有一位主人，他的妻子害怕那屋子里的寂静，在第一次踏入那屋子后就再也不肯涉足。她丈夫等了五年，之后做了一个布娃娃女人，跟真人的实际大小一样，把它打扮得非常漂亮。他把这布娃娃放在阳台上的一把椅子上，这样光线就能照在布娃娃毫无表情的脸上。但是他的儿子很爱母亲，把这娃娃拽了回来，藏在了窗帘后。

还有一位，他的妻子每当伤心的时候就会唱歌，而且经常如此。她带来一架钢琴，音调细长柔美，就像妈妈唱歌哄孩子睡觉那样。有的时候，钢琴的声音变得非常尖细。当它在夜晚被弹起时，声音像空气中的嗡鸣传向广场。路过的人猜不出到底是什么在响。

还有一位，他请人给他妻子画了画像并挂在屋子的墙上。但他没有遵守他的婚礼誓言，于是他的孙子把这画像取了下来。而在这画像所悬挂的地方，留下了一个轻微的污迹，无法抹去。

书中故事发生之时房子的主人还没给这屋子添置任何东西。但他的妻子倒是带来一件在她旅途中最吸引她注意力的艺术品。这是一个形状滑稽的罐子，体积很大，发亮，颜色苍白。罐子的一边是一个在荆棘中扭动的裸体男人的画像。这罐子被摆在一个由耶路撒冷附近的石头凿制的台子上。

这个房间就是这样的。

傍晚，当夜色降临，这所房子里最老的那个仆人会点燃壁炉架上的蜡烛。清晨，在所有人醒来之前，他会亲自打扫房间，给阳台上的红花浇水。冬天，他会给聚集在栏杆立柱上叽叽喳喳的麻雀喂点儿面包屑。

现在，这房子的主人名叫科特，他的妻子是阿德尔海德。





第二章


科特坐在靠近壁炉的扶手椅上看书。

他穿着晚礼服，将礼帽和手套摆在膝盖上，快速地翻动书页，不停地从额头向后捋着浓密的头发，并不时看看背着手走来走去的阿德尔海德。

阿德尔海德身材非常高挑，脸蛋儿如同她的白色礼裙一般白皙。她的嘴巴非常红艳，眼睛看上去大而奇异。她在头发上和腰间别了鲜花。

“你并没有在看书，科特。”阿德尔海德说道，不过她从他身边走开了。

科特把书合上，放在一边。然后他挪了挪椅子，以便可以面朝阿德尔海德。科特的眼睛比她的还要大，但更沉稳，他的嘴巴也显得更坚毅。

“你可真漂亮！”他说。

她轻轻地笑了几声，拉起科特的手，吻了吻，说道：

“你可真迷人！”

说完这句，阿德尔海德又开始走来走去。科特则伸直了腿坐在那里，头靠在椅子上，但眼睛却一直注视着阿德尔海德。阿德尔海德有时会停下脚步，摆弄她的礼裙，或用手指滑过钢琴琴键，随后她又穿过开着的门走到外面阳台上。此刻，科特无法从他的位置看到阿德尔海德，但她裙子的白色拖尾留在了屋内，他转而注视着它。

不久，阿德尔海德返回屋里，坐在另外一把椅子的扶手上，晃着她的脚。

“我不喜欢你精神这么亢奋，阿德尔海德。”科特说。

她的眼睛闪着光，她注视着壁炉，壁炉里有根木头正烧得旺。

“你应该喝杯酒，科特。”

“我不稀罕酒。”

“我也不稀罕。但是我喜欢它能提神。它能使人快活，让万物都变得那么迷人。”

“你喝酒了吗？”

“可是，科特，为什么你这么问？”

“因为你现在这么快活，而我又这么迷人。”

阿德尔海德向科特走去，将她的脸颊靠在他的头发上，说道：

“为了我，不要毁了这一刻。你总是能用一个词就毁掉这样的时刻，这是极大极大的罪恶。你说我很漂亮，我很高兴，因为你会这样想我，因为我会陪着你出门，因为你英俊潇洒，而且属于我。我们会远离对方，但正是因为我们之间的一切，让我们彼此更加亲密。我们仅是对彼此点点头——就像我们经常做的那样——就能知晓对方的想法。”

科特轻轻地挣脱了她的拥抱，说道：

“坐一会儿，跟我聊聊。”

阿德尔海德吻了吻科特，坐了下来，立刻忘记了刚才的消沉，眼睛又像之前那样闪起亮光。科特拨弄着壁炉里的余火，然后添了一根木头。他们静静地坐着，看着木头燃烧，烟缠绕着木头，又缓缓上升。阿德尔海德的脚点着地毯，科特则用手遮住自己的眼睛，继续他的思考。

“我大学第一年，”科特说道，“我们五人关系非常要好，每周六晚上都会见面。通常都是在我的房间，因为我可以承担花费。我们就这样坐着，喝酒，直到天亮，然后互相搀扶着回家。”

“那你们一定喝了很多酒！”

“我不清楚，可能很多。我们大声讲话，深入地交流。酒让我们觉得自己更伟大、更勇敢，也更聪明。第二天，我们就很不一样了，变得冷静沉默多了。但是我们可以直视对方的眼睛，因为我们没有做错什么事情。我们是否允许自己沉迷于酒精而失去自控，这并不要紧。我们彼此熟悉，互相信任。”

阿德尔海德坐在那里，默默地看着讲话的他。沉思中的科特不断地往壁炉里加木头，直到阿德尔海德拿走他手中的木头，放在一边。

“你会把房子点着的！”阿德尔海德说。

“人不应该跟陌生人喝酒，”科特说道，“你知道，被剥得一干二净是多么丢人的事情。而这就是会发生的事。”

“你说得就好像喝醉了是被脱光一样。”

科特没有注意阿德尔海德的话，继续说道：

“人会自己宽衣解带，会自己暴露自己。看看你的眼睛和你的笑容。我亲眼感受过：上百次，他们一丝不挂地坐在桌旁，暴露无遗。”

“这是在上流社会吗，科特？”

“不然还能在哪儿？”

“我不明白。”她说，“我不认识你说的那些人。”

“你今晚会见到他们，阿德尔海德。”

她不满地耸了耸肩，脚轻叩着地毯。

“阿德尔海德。”

她望着他，眼神忧郁而愠怒。他拉起她的手，紧紧握着，“我在那些注视你的眼睛里看到过，阿德尔海德。”

她抽走了她的手，“这太可恶了，科特！”

她站起来，走向阳台的门。他的目光紧随着她移动，闪烁着微光，“阿德尔海德。”

她背对着他站着，倚在窗框上，戴上了手套。他微微前倾，用手抓紧了椅子的扶手，“我在你的眼睛里也看到了，阿德尔海德。”

她没有动，也没有说一个字。当戴好手套后，她拎起裙摆，走到阳台上。

五月的风冷飕飕的，她穿着薄薄的礼裙，忍不住打了寒战。路灯在薄雾中昏暗地发着光，众多马车从广场穿过。她能听到马具上的铃铛叮当作响；车夫也在下面走来走去。

她转了个身，站在窗户那里，看着科特。他此时已将椅子移到了离壁炉更近的地方。她只能看到科特的一个肩膀和一只手臂，还有他那浓密的头发和双腿。

“马车已经到了。”她说。

他站起来，走向她。

“请你别生我的气，”他温柔地说道，“我不太舒服。”

“你生病了吗？”

“是的，也许……不，不是。”

“好吧，虽然我不情愿，但是我们可以待在家里。你已经扫了我的兴。”

“是吗？”

“当然。为了你，我才打扮得如此漂亮，我是希望跟你一起出去。”

“是吗？”

他握住她的手，将她拉向壁炉，“坐下，阿德尔海德，好啦，就一分钟。我们今晚能不能待在家里，喝点儿酒，自己欢乐一番？”

“好吧，你心情很不错！”

“听话，阿德尔海德。你是我唯一的放纵，你知道你是，那数百个欢乐的日子足以证明这一点。如果今晚你跟我想的一样，我们就来证明这点。我们会为彼此美好，我们的眼睛会为彼此闪光。”

阿德尔海德并没有看科特，但她摇了摇头。

“我会待在家里，如果你希望这样。”她说。

他们静静地坐着。壁炉台上的蜡烛在过堂风中摇曳不定。

“好奇怪，”他说，“你记得在伦敦的那个夜晚吗，阿德尔海德？那晚我们要去参加那个盛大的舞会。那时我求你待在家里，你答应了，而且很开心。”

阿德尔海德深深地陷入她的椅子里，手臂搭在脖子后面。

“那晚我并不开心。”她说道。

他抬起头，听她要说什么。

“我屈服了，科特，但我并不乐意那样做。我在假装高兴，为了你。”

他们看向彼此。阿德尔海德的眼神安静、哀伤，她注视着科特说道：

“我那时很邪恶，科特。我心里恨你，对你撒了谎。当我坐在你身边，握着你的手，开心地笑的时候，我内心想的都是在舞会上跳舞，一小时接着一小时地跳舞。”

阿德尔海德从扶手椅上滑了下来，依偎着科特，双手抱着科特的膝盖，眼神谦卑地注视着他的脸说：

“不要用那么陌生的眼光看我，科特。那是我本来的样子。我爱你。但是我生活里不能没有其他人，我需要他们看到，看到我的快乐。我想要漂亮，想要他们都爱上我，而我属于你。只有我在被爱的时候我才想要美丽。哦，不要有那样的表情，科特。”

她紧紧地贴着科特，眼神里充满了乞求。

“我并不邪恶，科特，对吗？当我们的小宝贝生病的时候，我也日日夜夜都陪伴着他，难道不是吗，科特？”

“是的。”他说。

“没错，我的确在他身边。但我不能总是保持安静。”

科特将阿德尔海德从椅子上扶起来，手揽着她的腰穿过屋子，走到阳台。此时，一辆马车正迅速地穿过广场，不久，许多马车出现在广场上。这些马车从街道的各个方向涌来，但都朝着一个方向奔去，消失在街道的拐角处。马蹄踏在路面上发出咔嗒咔嗒的声响，路灯照着马车闪闪发光，车夫和男仆笔直地坐在他们的车厢上。

“走吧，阿德尔海德，”科特说道，“我们出发吧。”

炉架上的蜡烛燃尽了，巨大的椅子上，那些雕刻的脸庞在黑暗中开心地笑着。天色变暗，老仆人来到屋里，整理了房间。夜晚降临时，老仆人在屋里点燃了蜡烛。

老仆人日复一日地做着相同的工作。太阳升起，太阳落下。喷泉里的水花飞溅。路灯点亮，人们成群结队地走过广场。阳台上的红花鲜艳明亮，每个晚上，灯光穿过开着的门洒满房间。

但夏天过后，没有人再进入这间屋子。





第三章


阿德尔海德站在阳台上。她摘下红色的花朵，然后扔向下面的广场。她穿着长长的白色礼服，手套和白色的围巾搁在地上。刚刚从剧院回来的她，感到非常无聊。

阿德尔海德转向屋子。

科特缩成一团坐在壁炉前，眼睛盯着前方。阿德尔海德想看看科特的脸，于是喊了他的名字。科特向后推了推他的椅子，抬头看了看。

“我正在回想我们刚刚看的戏剧。”他说。

“没错，这戏太愚蠢了。”

阿德尔海德拽了拽另外一把椅子，这样她就能看到那个画着在荆棘中扭动的裸体男人的坛子。

“曾经有段时间，我非常厌烦法律，”科特说，“当诗人让我看到为了爱情而冲破婚姻的束缚时，我很开心。我曾以为通过爱，人们会变得更伟大，天堂会变得更高远，大地看起来更郁郁葱葱。”

她又打了个寒战，用裙子紧紧地包裹住她的脚踝。

“现在我非常厌烦无法无天的行为。我憎恨那些女人和她们的情人。”

“你现在也结婚了。”她回答。

“你说什么？”

科特抬起头。阿德尔海德能看出来，科特并没有听到她刚才说的话，她为此感到欣慰。

“肯定是有挣扎的，毫无疑问。”阿德尔海德说。

“当然，肯定有。有的。在过去，他们走到一起是不被允许的，而现在他们不被允许住在一起。”

阿德尔海德什么都没说，但她的手却慢慢地抚过那坛子。

“所有不忠贞的妻子都玷污了爱情。我能想象一个风雅的女人如何扼杀她的爱，因为她不会给这份爱任何生存的余地。”

“因为她害怕。”

“因为她风雅。”

他们默默地坐了一会儿，盯着白色灰烬里的余火看。

“你觉得会有很多人那么做吗？”

他抬起头。

“你觉得有很多不忠贞的妻子吗？”

“我不知道。为什么不会有？”

他把头靠在手上。阿德尔海德把玩着那坛子。

“但我无法理解人们要去戏院。”

“那你让他们去哪儿？”

科特向后推了推自己的椅子，以便能看到阿德尔海德。阿德尔海德一动不动，脑子里一片空白。

“阿德尔海德，”科特说，“我想今晚你应该不愿意待在家里吧？”

阿德尔海德躺回到椅子里，看着她自己的双手。

“哦，我想出去吃晚饭。”

“可是我很想跟你聊天。”

“但我确实从剧院回到家里了，亲爱的。”阿德尔海德答道，同时把手伸向科特。

而科特没有看到她的手，于是阿德尔海德把手放了下来。

“看完剧，我宁愿待在家里，阿德尔海德。”

“是的，我知道，”阿德尔海德答道，但她耸了耸肩，说，“可我无法理解。”

“但是在剧院你能理解，现在你又想去外面吃饭。”

科特向阿德尔海德俯下身，以便引起她的注意。阿德尔海德什么都不说，也不看他。

“阿德尔海德。”

阿德尔海德皱紧眉头。

“你看，我去戏院从来不是为了看戏，”她说，“看戏对于我来说一点儿意思都没有。但是，看那茫茫人海，听他们一会儿喧闹，一会儿安静，我觉得十分有趣。我喜欢他们听到台上精彩的对白时而鼓掌喝彩，时而沉静思考的样子。然后我的内心就会欢唱起来，这让我很享受。”

科特看了阿德尔海德一会儿，然后搓着双手大笑起来。阿德尔海德把椅子转向科特，她的膝盖几乎可以碰到科特。

“关于今晚，你到底想对我说什么？”她问，“难道不能等到戏演完？不能再等上一小时？我现在想出去吃晚饭。”

科特看着她，摇了摇头。

“到底是什么？或者你只是疲乏空虚，就跟我一样，以及跟那些不忠的妻子一样，还有那些现代诗人，还有……还有所有人？”

“不，阿德尔海德，”他说，“不。没什么。什么都没有。”

“我不知道你在说什么，”阿德尔海德突然狠狠地将自己抛回到椅子里，“你话里有话。”

科特点点头。

“你在生我的气。我做了什么？据我所知，我们跟圈子里的其他人没什么两样地活着。我们旅行，我们去戏院，我们去拜访朋友，我们在自己家里接待朋友，我们去结识有意思的人，艺术家……以及任何是个人物的人。”

“在这些有趣的人中间，你总会感到开心吗？”

阿德尔海德看着科特，带着些疑惑不解，“没有‘总是’这样的事。”

“是的，”科特说，“的确没有‘总是’这样的事情，所以就更值得怜悯。”

他们静静地坐着，陷入沉思。然后，科特捋了捋他额头的头发，平静地说：

“请你试着理解我，阿德尔海德。当一个女人出嫁，成为一个母亲，她通常会变得沉静。我是说，沉静一点儿。我的意思是，这世界上有女人无法赢得的胜利和无法获取的成就。一个已是母亲的女人不会为此烦恼。她不会想要试图征服这些，阿德尔海德，因为她已经升华了自己的生命，因为她已经属于一个男人，任何接触其他男人的想法都让她感到厌恶。这样她就会变得沉静……更加沉静。而这种沉静并不是空虚，它比其他任何感情都要丰富。”

阿德尔海德看着科特，她那愤怒的眼睛中闪烁着陌生而好奇的光芒。

“你嫉妒了吗？”她问。

科特摇了摇头，比了一个否定的手势。阿德尔海德从椅子里突然起来，站到科特面前，怒目圆睁，骄傲地说：

“你应该嫉妒，科特，你应该嫉妒。我是你的，而且我爱你。你曾赢得了我；但请你确保你知道如何一直拥有我。为我而战，科特。我还年轻，我很漂亮，这个世界上的男人多得是。”

科特不紧不慢地站了起来，一直看着阿德尔海德，阿德尔海德一度认为科特会伸手打她。

“下个月你就二十六岁了，”他说，“而且，我们家族的人不会为了保住自己的老婆而战斗。”

“科特！”

阿德尔海德坐了下来，脑袋一片空白。科特望着她，她也望着科特。她禁不住想科特好高啊，科特非常轻易地就能穿上他的衣服，还有就是科特的一个肩膀比另外一个低一些。

科特穿过房间，他走得太快差点儿被地毯绊倒。然后他费力地摆弄着老纺车，把它拉了过来。这期间，阿德尔海德一直注视着他。

“你会使用我曾奶奶的纺纱车吗，阿德尔海德？”科特问道。

阿德尔海德两只胳膊交叉在胸前，望着科特。

“难道你不会，阿德尔海德？那你不能学一学吗？如果我求你，你都不肯吗？”

科特把纺车径直拉到阿德尔海德面前摆放好，就如同阿德尔海德要立刻使用这纺车一样。做完这些后，科特又坐回到他的椅子里。

“你不觉得你能行吗，阿德尔海德？”

他们狠狠地直视对方。但不久，两人都有点儿尴尬，低下了头。

他们都想伸出手，但又不肯先做出这样的举动。两人渴望投入对方的怀抱，但却都坐得如同雕塑般一动不动。他们的嘴巴颤抖，但他们拒绝抬头看看对方，因此也并不知道对方心里想着什么。

“我在想，在这些大椅子里我们看起来这么渺小。”科特最终说。

他的声音非常冷静，阿德尔海德也立刻冷静下来。结束了，他们的灵魂重新平静。这不能算作和解，因为他们根本不记得任何争吵。他们信任地看着彼此。没有任何芥蒂，他们又重归于好了。

“我在想，我们是不是比不上我们之前曾坐在这里的人，”阿德尔海德说，“不同，是的。但是会比不上吗？”

两人都站了起来。

“差很远吧，”科特说，“而且远不如他们快乐。”

他们穿过房间，走到阳台上，这是他们睡觉之前的习惯。

九月夜晚的星空格外高远。大部分的路灯都已熄灭，广场上人烟稀少。一个酒鬼在远远的地方唱着歌。喷泉里流水的声音在寂静的夜里显得格外清晰。

“这里好美！”科特说。

“是的。”

“夏夜马上就结束了，而我们还没来得及享受。”

她把头靠在他的肩上，然后闭上了眼。

“我想世界上再没有一个广场如此美丽了。”科特说。

“哦，是有的，在佛罗伦萨。”

科特叹了口气，把她带进了屋子，“我们旅行得太多啦，阿德尔海德。”

她迅速地离开，打开房门，而科特还在阳台上站着。

那股怒气重新在科特的胸中凝聚。他想将其平息，但毫无效果。

“你进来吗，科特？”

阿德尔海德站在走廊上看不到科特的位置。

“走你的吧……我一会儿就过来。”

科特努力使自己的声音听起来尽可能平静，但是即便在他自己的耳朵里，听起来都非常不自然。他静静地站着，听着走廊上的动静。阿德尔海德站了一会儿，好像在考虑什么。

然后她关上了门，离开了。科特能听出来，她走得很急。





第四章


入冬以来的第一场雪降临了，静静地染白了阳台，麻雀在积雪上面绣着图案。

红色的鲜花摆在温暖的房内，看上去很是可怜。一张大桌子被放在房间靠里的位置，桌上摆了一盏台灯和一堆书。

科特很早就来了。

他径直走到桌子旁，坐了下来，打开一本书。一会儿，他又站到窗户前向外面望。

天色渐暗。这是一个潮湿而雾蒙蒙的夜晚，一束单薄微红的灯光在透着寒气湿漉漉的屋顶后闪烁。广场上的雪已融化成雪泥。喷泉悄无声息，掩埋在一堆木板和废松木下。

科特再一次坐下开始阅读。不久他又站起来，看了看手表，走向窗户那里，然后开始在房间里不断徘徊，最终再次坐了下来。他点了支雪茄，又把它掐灭了。然后他离开了，一个小时后又回来，重复做着这些事情。

快到午夜的时候，有马车穿过了大门，五分钟后，阿德尔海德站在屋里，高挑而白皙，大大的眼睛扑闪着。

“你玩得开心吗，阿德尔海德？”

阿德尔海德知道，科特并不在乎这问题的答案，因此她也就没有直接回答。

“我快冻死了。”她说。

阿德尔海德把自己的那把椅子使劲拖向壁炉旁，然后把自己蜷缩在椅子里，把脚搭在了壁炉的围栏上。

“他们都在询问你的近况，科特。”

“当然。”

科特翻了翻书页，然后合上了书，把自己的椅子拉向阿德尔海德。他坐下来，手托着脸，看起来很疲倦。

“科特，你打算成天都坐在这间屋子里吗？”

“不，只在晚上，当我没什么事可做的时候，我就爱待在这间屋子里。”

阿德尔海德双手紧握，闭上了眼睛。

“我讨厌这屋子，”她说，“我们之间所有的不愉快都来自这里。”

科特没有回应，他走到桌子那里拿雪茄。当科特重重地盖上雪茄盒时，阿德尔海德突然感觉到了什么，整个人不舒服起来。

“科特，你打算跟我们的熟人都断绝联系吗？”

“没有，”科特说道，“我不会的。但刚才我不想出去。”

“你觉得我们的朋友会怎么说啊？”

“他们想怎么说就怎么说吧。”

“难道你就不想想，这一切让我很不愉快吗？”

“当然。但是我目前不愿意出去。”

科特用壁炉架上点着的蜡烛点燃了雪茄，之后他坐了下来，静静地抽着雪茄，望着火炉。阿德尔海德看着科特，叹了口气。

不知怎么的，阿德尔海德突然感到心被触动了，她的眼睛湿润了，“你不快乐吗，科特？”

科特抬起头，注视着她，“是的。”

“这是我的错吗？因为你的妻子是一个愚蠢的女人，整天就想着出去交际？”

“你不是那样的，阿德尔海德。”

“因为我是一个轻浮不安分的现代产物吗？”

“你不是那样的。”

“那我是哪样的，科特？”

他牵起了她的手，吻了吻，然后朝她笑了笑，“你是我的妻子，阿德尔海德。我们还有个孩子，将来我们可能还会再生一个。”

“不，”阿德尔海德抽回了自己的手，“不，科特。我不会再要了。”

科特什么都没有说。他的手无力地垂了下来，他的脸色从未像现在这样苍白。阿德尔海德注意到科特的反应，她担心科特是生病了，于是弯下腰来，轻轻地呼唤着他的名字。

但科特没有看她，也没有听她的呼唤。

阿德尔海德无法将视线从科特身上挪开。她心里想到，就是他们的孩子死掉，科特的反应也不过如此了。阿德尔海德为自己在这件事情上感到开心而觉得极其羞耻。她害怕极了，唯恐科特会看她。

就在这时，科特望向阿德尔海德，并捕捉到了她心里的想法。

阿德尔海德看到科特越来越沮丧，她内心的开心就越发不可收拾。她不能理解自己这样的情绪反应，并深深地为此感到困扰。

科特的眼睛里，并没有一丝愤怒，阿德尔海德在脑海中搜寻着，想要想出一个词能让科特说点儿什么或是动一动。

但是科特就一直静静地坐在那里，慢慢地扭转了头，不再看阿德尔海德。而阿德尔海德也不知道要说些什么。

她站了起来，走到窗户那里，在那里站了一会儿。之后她又走回来，坐到了一把椅子里，“你在想什么，科特？”

“想你。”

屋子里的两人再次陷入沉默。

“阿德尔海德。”

他温柔平静地喊着她的名字，但是她却被吓到了。

“我会为你而战，阿德尔海德，我是说我会去争夺你，原本我们未来的孩子应该能帮我，但现在我只能孤身奋斗了。”

阿德尔海德隐约记得这句话似乎在什么时候被说过，但那时她并没有理解科特的意思。

“我会以生命和快乐作赌注去为你而战，”他说，“我会跟你聊天，一直纠缠你并征服你。我会把你抱在怀中，把你的后路阻断，然后去追逐你，原谅你。”

“那如果你没有赢得我呢？”

“我会赢得你的。”

“但如果没有呢？”

她看着科特的嘴巴，等待他的答案。这答案来得异常平静，科特甚至都没看阿德尔海德，自顾自地说道：

“如果没有，那我就抛弃你。”

阿德尔海德紧紧地闭上眼，又大大地睁开，“最好能立刻抛弃我，科特。如果你能做到的话。”

“我做不到。我们有个孩子，而且我们还喜欢着对方。”

“我不确定。”阿德尔海德说。

“你不确定什么？”

阿德尔海德没有再回答，只是摇了摇头。

“你将得到你想要的自由，”科特说，“你可以尽情地去外面玩，尽情开心，邀请客人都来家里做客。随你的性子去开心去忧伤。你现在就可以去了，如果你想的话。”

“那你再也不会跟我一起了吗？”

“不可能了。我不会在那种地方追你了。我曾在那里得到了你，而且我也不担心你……那方面。无论怎样，我不会再费力在那样的场合去追你了。”

“那之后呢？”

“你知道你可以在任何夜晚在这间屋子里找到我。这里是我将长久生活的地方。”

科特站起来，慢慢地穿过屋子。阿德尔海德从椅子上滑到了地板上，脸靠着壁炉围栏，眼睛死死地盯着前方。她看着科特走了过来，站在她身边，然后又走了回去。

“科特，”阿德尔海德说，“我永远都不会再来这里。”

“你随意。”

科特坐了下来，双手托着头，说道：

“我的祖先，在他富丽堂皇的新房子里建造了这间神圣的婚姻密室时，他很清楚地知道他当时在做什么。这屋子高高在上，远离日间和夜晚的工作生活。他看得非常深远。”

“这屋子是一个折磨人的地方，”阿德尔海德说，“我敢肯定，很多女人都曾在这里痛苦地流泪。”

科特欠身，手放在了前额。

“我害怕极了，科特。你想虐待我。我没办法照你希望的去做。我们去别的地方聊天，去你的房间吧，科特？”

“不，”科特说，“我们就在这里。我们注定要在这里。”

他站起来又立刻坐下，眼里闪着光，“他们都曾坐在这里，那些在这座房子里生活的男主人和他们的妻子荣辱与共。他们注视着我们，他们的低语在这周围回荡，你难道听不到我曾祖母的纺车声吗？你听不到钢琴的声音吗？”

“是的，科特。”

“在这里，我们的言语在这静谧中变得更重大。在这里，我们的爱和愤怒都更有力量。我们不论做什么，都可以在这里完成。他们明白，那些年老的男人和女人是明白的。”

阿德尔海德起身站在科特面前，倚着壁炉上的架子，高挑而白皙，“他们知道如何在这房子里遵守规则。”

阿德尔海德看着科特，她红艳的嘴唇和陌生的眼神中显示着骄傲、害怕和愤怒。

“他们确实做到了这一点，”科特说，“上帝保佑已经身葬坟墓里的他们！”

阿德尔海德坐了下来，抱着那个陶罐，罐子上的男人仍在荆棘中扭动着。她盯着那男人的脸，就好像她跟他在一起，一并感受到了荆棘的刺痛。

“也是在这里，阿德尔海德，我们注定要跟彼此永远在一起。那晚我们把我们的名字写在那张古老泛黄的纸上，封在墙里，你向这个屋子起过誓，虽然你很讨厌那么做。而且，不久之后，我们的儿子也将带着能给他幸福的女人来到这里。”

科特走到阳台又走了回来，身上落满了白雪。寒气入室，阿德尔海德打了个冷战。他静静地在火炉旁站了一会儿，又开始在屋里踱步。阿德尔海德听着他的脚步声，想要说点儿什么，却一句话都说不出来。

然后她走向那架古老的钢琴，坐在钢琴前，开始唱：

我的丽诺尔，白昼带来的负担，

是多么忧郁而悲伤！

我听不到悦耳的钟声，

也没有小鸟在日光里歌唱。

亲爱的丽诺尔，哦，我的女神，

你眼睛如此明亮，白昼都显得暗淡，

一定要给我金色的美酒，

是夜晚从她那芬芳的罐子中倾倒。

紫罗兰看着我们，草原上的蓝色，

我们的秘密不会错过任何一颗星星。

亲吻我吧，丽诺尔，再次亲吻我，

千万次地亲吻我。

轻柔的旋律穿透屋子，然后阿德尔海德停了下来。

她仔细听了听，已经听不到科特的脚步声。此时科特坐在其中一个大椅子里，一动不动。

阿德尔海德扭过头看了科特一会儿，然后她站起来，合上钢琴，故意弄出很大的声响，“晚安，科特。”

“晚安。”

阿德尔海德脸色一阵白一阵红，眼睛湿润，生气地离开了屋子。





第五章


阿德尔海德浑身冰冷地坐在靠近壁炉的地方。

壁炉里，火苗旺盛。红色的火焰炙烤着她的脸庞和她白色的礼服。但她依旧继续往壁炉里添木头，总也暖和不过来。

科特坐在另外一把椅子里读书，但他的书却放在膝盖上，手托着头。书很大，书页泛黄，字体老旧。

阿德尔海德沮丧地看了看科特。她非常后悔自己来到这间屋子，如果她有力气的话，她肯定早就离开了。她叹了口气，眼神疲惫地望着炉火。

“阿德尔海德，听着。”

科特双手捋了把头发，读道：

但，当泰王后知道奥拉夫已经死去的消息后，她陷入了昏迷，在那里躺了很久。当她醒过来的时候，她的悲伤如此沉重，以至于屋子中的人都为她感到难过。当白昼过去，她来到一个住在附近的德高望重的修士的家里。她问这位修士，自杀是否违背上帝的意志。因为她的主人、她的丈夫已死去，她对人生无可眷恋。但这位修士告诉她：

“自杀确实是一种罪过。因为上帝给予我们生命，并且会在他认为合适的时候收回。”

之后，这位王后流下眼泪，因为她即将犯下深重的罪孽。但第二日清晨，她又来到修士这里，问道，一个人能吃多么少而不会惹上帝生气？这次，修士怜悯她，说：

“如果你一天吃一个苹果，这就足够了。”

之后，泰王后在她的躺椅上躺了下来，命令所有的侍女退下，这样她便可以和她的悲伤独处，并命令她最信任的一个侍女每日早晨用金色的杯子为她送上一枚苹果。这样过了八天，第九天早晨，当侍女来到王后身边，发现王后已经随她的丈夫去了天堂。

科特合上书。他的嘴唇动了动，就好像他在对自己重复刚才说过的话。阿德尔海德若有所思地看着炉火，然后说：

“那些去世的老一辈人真幸运。他们都有一位圣人，每当他们感到沮丧，就可以向他倾诉。”

科特听到这话，摇了摇头。

“你扭曲了事实，阿德尔海德，”他说，“并不全是那样。王后想要死去，她就死去了。她去修士那里只是想要洗清罪过，虔诚地遵从他的命令。”

“那时候他们还相信上帝。”阿德尔海德说。

“是的，他们相信。古老而强大的上帝掌握着他们的命运。”

此时，科特很快地起身站到壁炉旁。

“你信上帝吗，科特？”

“不，”科特说道，“我不信。但我相信上帝曾经是存在的。而且我觉得，如果他此刻在的话，绝对是件好事。”

“我也觉得是。”

科特抱着自己的膝盖，脚踩在壁炉围栏上，说道：

“上帝仍然存在于某些地方。我并不畏惧上帝。如果我有机会直视他的脸，我敢说我一生荣耀高贵，坦坦荡荡。”

阿德尔海德笑笑，“你说的是那个古老而强大的上帝吗？”

科特瞥了一眼阿德尔海德，但却没有生气。他走到阿德尔海德身边，说道：

“就是那个古老而强大的上帝。没有他，我自己可以过得很好。但我需要他在我家里。”

阿德尔海德把头靠向了椅子，大笑道：

“确实如此，科特。你确实需要他在你的家里。”

她继续大笑，然后说道：

“如果他在的话，我敢肯定楼下那个，叫什么来着，再也不敢在账房抢你的钱了。你是这么想的吗，科特？还有，你的妻子每个早晨都会亲吻你的手，然后卑微地询问她那严厉的主人的命令。”

科特在屋里踱着步，没有说话。

阿德尔海德以为科特并没有在听她的调侃，因为她的话语不值得科特思考，她开始对自己不满，而且还生科特的气，“但是，要说到故事，当然还有哈格巴斯和西涅，更不用提罗密欧和朱丽叶，还有玛利亚·韦克则拉和埃尔韦拉·马迪根。”

科特自顾自地走着。

“我并没有说任何反对这故事的话。这是个美好的故事，说不定还是件真实的事情。不管怎样，应该给年轻人树立个正确的榜样。但就泰王后来讲，她对丈夫的爱肯定多多少少取决于他们结婚的时间。”

科特没怎么看阿德尔海德。阿德尔海德觉得自己被当成了孩子一样对待——无须费心去回答，这激起了她的斗志，她在努力寻找正确的词语，以伤到科特。

“每一段爱情都会消逝，”阿德尔海德说，“我们都知道这点儿。那些在爱情消逝前就死掉的人是很幸运的。他们美好地出现在历史里，但这并不能证明他们就要好过我们。”

科特仍旧不停地走来走去，然后他站在窗前向外看了看，继而又开始走。

“科特。”

科特在她的椅子前停下并看着她。

“你知道奥拉夫国王和泰王后结婚多久了吗？”

“问这个有什么意义呢，阿德尔海德？”

阿德尔海德向后推了推自己的椅子，站了起来。她一时没有组织好语言，无法表达自己想要说的意思，只是向科特跨了一步，又坐回了椅子里，她感到无力。

此时，科特眼神中的某种东西帮助了她，然后她站了起来，坚定地看着科特：“这意味着，你整天坐在这里，在你的旧书、旧物件和无聊的故事里生锈发霉，而真正的生活却绕过你在你的身边进行。用不了多久，你的胡子就会长到这桌子，这期间你根本不会说话，即便偶尔说那么一词半句，也过于深奥，没有人能够理解。”

“阿德尔海德，不会发生你说的那种情况的。”科特说。

“但是我不希望成为泰王后，也不希望成为西涅或者他们中的任何一个，”阿德尔海德的声音如此生硬，科特内心一阵酸楚，“我想成为现在的我，那个你爱上并拥入怀中的女人。我不生活在书里。不会有女学生在她们的书本里读到我的故事。我没有时间浪费在无聊的老式恋爱上，我无法理解这种爱情，所以也不相信这样的爱情。我想要疯狂的、激情的爱情。”

当她说话时，科特的视线已从她身上离开，这会儿又重新望着她，说道：

“难道你还没得到它吗，阿德尔海德？”

阿德尔海德重新坐到椅子上，用很陌生的眼神望着科特。科特从未看过这样的双眼。像是层层纱幕遮住她的双眼，阿德尔海德的眼睛非常暗，突然，她的眼睛里有一丝光闪现，但转瞬即逝，纱幕再次落下。“我不知道。”她回答。

她的声音那么轻，科特差点儿没听到。科特停了一会儿，看她是否还有别的要说。

然后，科特低下头，他那浓密的头发落到前额，然后他又把头发向后耙了一下，脸色惨白，“难怪。”

科特慢慢地穿过屋子，走向窗台，额头抵着窗户栅栏。阿德尔海德先是慢慢地转向科特，又转了回来，面向壁炉。

阿德尔海德似乎说了什么，然后，她就听到了科特压抑的回答，看到了科特惨白而严肃的脸。她知道那并不是她想要说的，同时，她所说的也都是真实的。看着她爱着的男人受伤，她有一些懊悔，因无法去做任何弥补而感到内心泛起一阵绝望。

这些情愫酝酿成了阿德尔海德对科特的愤怒，是科特激得她说了那样的话。最终，愤怒消散，留下的是阿德尔海德对自己深深的怜悯。

阿德尔海德从未像现在这样看透自己的灵魂，她变得茫然，被一阵疯狂而奇特的渴望笼罩。随即她感到俯身在井口，自己快速地跌落，她紧紧地抓住椅子的扶手，关节处都已发白。

在这恐惧之外，远处有只小鸟在金色和绿色的草地上歌唱，阿德尔海德从未在自己的梦中见过这样的景象……

科特来到阿德尔海德的面前，伸出手。

“晚安，阿德尔海德。”科特说。

阿德尔海德坐直了身子，迷惑地望着科特。

“你打算离开这里吗？”她问。

“不。我希望你去上床睡觉。我会在这里多待一会儿，读读书。”

科特坐了下来，拿起了书。阿德尔海德慢慢地穿过屋子。

到达门口的时候，她停了一会儿，看了看科特，他的脸很平静，但感觉很遥远。阿德尔海德在想，他会不会抬头，然后再说一遍晚安，或者仅是点点头。

然而科特既没有抬头也没有点头，他就静静地在那里看书。





第六章


壁炉里的火将要熄灭，蜡烛也快要燃尽。屋里屋外一样安静。

科特仍坐在他的椅子上。他坐在那里已经很久了，一动不动，思考着什么。他的手指插进头发里，仔细听着阿德尔海德的脚步声。

阿德尔海德此刻待在家里，她已经在家里待了整整一个星期了。但在过去的两周里，她都没有去过那间屋子。

科特看看时间，然后他站起来离开了屋子，走出了房子。




不久之后，阿德尔海德来到屋子里。

她在门口站了一会儿，惊奇地发现屋子里竟然没人。她冲阳台喊了喊科特，没人回应。她迟疑地走向窗户朝外望去，那里也没有人。

她迅速地转身离开。科特不在屋里让她有点儿小懊恼，尤其是想到为了来这屋子她付出了什么样的代价。但这懊恼仅持续了一小会儿，随即她又为没有和科特正面相遇而感到开心。比起前些日子，此刻她心情舒畅了不少。

她好奇地看了看这屋子。她从未独自在这里待过，也似乎从未仔细地观察过这里。

阿德尔海德在那对古老的椅子前站了许久，对着椅子上雕刻的怪异脸庞陷入了沉思。她极尽所能地摆弄那对椅子，一会儿让它们面对面，一会儿让它们并排挨着，然后她坐下来，好像要试试看是什么感觉。她回想起所知道的那些曾坐在这里的人，想象他们的对话，觉得很有意思。

然后她走到天球仪那里，按下按键，于是星星动了起来，闪耀着光芒。她高兴地看着这个奇怪的玩具，一遍遍地转动这玩具的发条。

她拉出了那台老旧的纺车，开始纺起布来。纺车的轮子在安静的屋里有力地转着，那呜呜的声音让阿德尔海德快活极了。她甚至希望那位曾祖母此刻来到这里，表扬她如此勤劳。

她从纺车边站了起来，站在屋子的中央，环视屋子。她想到了一个场景，她站在一座印度寺庙里，极度冷静地审视那里的每一件古老物件，也冷静地审视这印度教圣地。

阿德尔海德感到如同站在一座停尸房里一样，古老有趣的物件摆放在这屋里，但一张张充满愚蠢想法和荒谬迷信的木乃伊的脸却盯着她。她并不害怕，因为她知道他们都已死去，再也回不来了。

她的视线落在了墙上的那浅浅的污迹上，那里曾挂过一幅肖像。

“可怜的莱克！”她大声感叹道，“你被关在了这神殿之外了，因为你的丈夫欺骗了你。”

她抬起双臂，欢呼雀跃，她出生在平和的年代，生活在平和的年代，她依旧能感受到温热的血液在她心中涌动。

阿德尔海德在屋里转了一圈，放声大笑，她如此轻易地便破除了这老屋子的魔咒。她拍拍那大椅子硬邦邦的后背，友好地跟它们对话。她曾经忌恨这椅子：曾经每当她坐在椅子里时，就感觉她的血液变得冰冷。而现在，这椅子只不过就是两把时髦的、价值不菲的椅子而已。

她把那“神圣之地”的薄纱撕了下来，后面什么都没有。

她跑向窗户，猛地拉开了窗帘。

那洋娃娃僵硬可笑地坐在那里。

她把她的脸贴近洋娃娃的蜡制脸颊，用她那红艳的唇吻了吻它。

哼着小曲，她又坐在那古老的钢琴边。她在寻找一首圣歌以庆贺她的胜利。

但刚弹奏第一个音符，她突然就害怕起来。

她感到屋子里还有其他人。

阿德尔海德跳了起来，弄倒了椅子，她四处张望。

没有人。

蜡烛还剩一支就全部熄灭了，屋子里一片漆黑。终于，剩余的那只蜡烛也摇摇曳曳，坚持了一会儿，也熄灭了。

然后，屋里传来一阵令人毛骨悚然的喃喃声和低语声。

有人走过地板……好多重重的脚步声。纺车开始旋转，钢琴也在她背后唱起歌来。星星疯跑，闪烁光芒，洋娃娃也摇晃起来。那些雕刻在老木椅上的脸庞伸长了脖子要啄她，诡异地发出笑声。

罐子上那个在荆棘中穿行的男人喊着救命……她能听到他的喊声。他越来越大……越来越近……她看到他裸露的肢体上滴下的鲜血……

阿德尔海德颤抖着爬到了门口，眼中充满了恐惧。





第七章


阿德尔海德伸手放在科特的书上，说道：

“我能和你谈谈吗？我能告诉你一件事吗？我能跟你说，你现在所做的是愚蠢的行为吗？”

科特挪开阿德尔海德的手，抬起了头。

“坐下，阿德尔海德，”他疲倦地说，“坐在那椅子里。”

阿德尔海德从科特手里夺过书，扔到了地板上，“你病了，科特。你在这间可怕的屋子里得了病。”

“那你有家庭良方吗？”科特问。

“你怎么还有心情说笑？”

“如果是笑话，也是个冷笑话，”他说道，“但这并不是笑话。我相信传统的治疗方法。”

阿德尔海德坐在她的椅子里，无助地看着前方。

“你当然会信，”她说，“你还信老书本，以及所有死去的东西。”

科特没有回应，疲倦地打着哈欠。

“上帝会回到他的宝座上，我呢，会坐到纺车上，然后我们会有幸福的婚姻，从此过上美好的生活。”

科特双腿交叠，看着他的指甲。

“是的，这是我的计划，”他静静说道，“差不多就是那样。你刚刚真挚动人地表述了这个计划。”

“科特，你怎么还有这样的心情？”

阿德尔海德晃来晃去，她的手放在膝盖上，她的眼睛湿润了。她想再说些什么，但又说不出来，泪水让她哽咽。她无法理解他为什么不帮她。然后她说道：

“科特，我们的关系很糟糕。”

科特依旧沉默。阿德尔海德努力让自己镇定，她闭上转来转去的眼睛，说道：

“我们必须遵循我们所处的这个时代的规律，不是吗，科特？毕竟，我们是现代人，我们俩都是。或许你觉得现代人是疲倦的、空虚的，但我们的感受和想法毕竟与你喜欢的那些人不一样。并且，我们无法改变自己。但像我们这样的人，就是现在，我们可以尽可能地快乐……我们有什么不开心的呢，科特？”

“我不开心。”

“哦，科特！”

阿德尔海德双手合十，十指交叉，紧紧握着，她低下头，眼泪滴在手上。然后她泪流满面地转向科特，问道：

“那么，我是不是不再漂亮了，科特？”

科特站起身来，亲吻了她那雪白的额头。

“你依旧非常漂亮，”他说道，“但这对于我们糟糕的关系已没什么作用了。”

科特开始来回踱步。阿德尔海德默默地、狠狠地哭泣着。一会儿后，她说：

“你在逼我离开你，科特。我想趁着还有时间，告诉你这些话，如果我能找到合适的言语。你能坐下来吗，科特？我的头疼得很。”

科特坐在椅子里，然后阿德尔海德站起来，往壁炉里添了些木头，继而又坐下，说道：

“每当我们一起说话的时候，科特，我就很害怕我自己，这不仅仅是因为我有点儿邪恶，总是说一些不是我本意的话。是的，我也总是口是心非。但你那么好，你让我看到我脑子里的想法，这些想法在你没有说出来的时候并不存在。但当你说出来的时候，我会意识到你是对的，并且这正是我所想的。科特，这可真糟糕。”

沉默再一次降临。阿德尔海德闭上眼睛，科特不安地在椅子里挪动。

“阿德尔海德，”科特说道，“那晚你告诉我……”

“你不要说那个，你不要说出来。”

“你还记得吗，你说……关于那狂野、激情的爱情，你说我们所拥有的不是这样的爱？”

阿德尔海德摇了摇科特的手，然后紧紧握住。

“就是这样的，”她说，“我感激你，因为你这么好，还因为你不会生我的气。但是，一开始我并没有意识到我内心的想法，科特。我当时不知道。但你说了那些话，然后使得我说了我所说的。但是就在那一刻，我明白，我说的是真的。这让我感到很难过，我从未那么难过过。但同时我也觉得我似乎比以前更加富有。我不再害怕未来，因为女人在她们还年轻的时候有时会想到那种爱情，科特。而当这一切都已成过去，一切将变得空虚。”

科特面向壁炉，静静地听着。

“我敢肯定，世界上没有一个男人能够理解我刚才说的话。”她说道。

然后，阿德尔海德平躺在地板上，头靠在壁炉的围栏上，眼睛里充满光芒。

“女人年轻的时光太短，”她说，“而且女人总是在担心时光会匆匆流逝。当她突然怀疑：还有比她本以为是最好的爱情更好的。然后，她或许会突然意识到这一切还没有结束，难道你不能理解那时她所经历的悲伤害怕吗？”

科特大笑，“本以为已经拥有最好的了，结果却发现还有更好的，这实在不是什么愉快的事情。”科特说。

但阿德尔海德摇摇头，说道：

“不是那样的，科特。”

科特向后推了推椅子，站了起来，开始在屋里踱步，沉默又一次笼罩了这间屋子。然后他在她身边坐了下来，“你所说的是真的。但它的确在你的骨子里，我很高兴是我让你看清了它。当我意识到这一点时，我就无法再做别的选择。我无法静静等待另外的男人打开你的心扉，给你那最伟大的爱情。”

阿德尔海德脸靠着围栏看着科特，“不，科特。如果是那样的话，我所说的就是错的。”

他摆摆手，不耐烦地摇摇头，“或许不是今天或者明天。但可能会是一年、两年后，或是十年后。如果没有发生，那也只是因为意外。”

阿德尔海德向科特靠近，将自己的头放在科特的膝盖上。她抬头看了看科特是否介意自己这样。但科特迷失在自己的思绪中，并没有注意到。

阿德尔海德突然感到内心平静且满足。她很开心说出了自己想要说的话。她感到似乎这件事情已被远远地移开，甚至消失了，她不能明白为什么科特还要继续谈论它。

科特所说的另外一个男人，在阿德尔海德看来如此遥远，毫无可能。她像思考别人的事情一样想着此事，说道：

“我爱你，科特。如果有一天，有另外一个男人出现了，并且我爱上了他，难道我能控制住吗？”

科特猛地站起来，靠在他膝盖上的阿德尔海德赶紧抓住椅子的扶手以免摔倒。

“不，”科特讽刺地说，“你当然控制不住。”

他在屋子里疾速穿行，将自己的话重复了三四遍。阿德尔海德从地板上站起来，坐到了她的椅子里，闭上眼睛。

“想到这个借口的人真是个天才，把人生活下去的一大部分力量都驱散了。”

科特一头扎进他的椅子，然后静静地坐了很久。看到科特安静下来，阿德尔海德很欣慰。

“为什么一个人控制不了他的心？”科特最终说道，“假设我有一个妻子和一个孩子，我的妻子是我自己选择的伴侣。有一天，我遇到另外一个女人，她勾起我的欲望。我与她在舞会上相识，那里有灯光、美酒和音乐，我们并非真实的自己，她与我，我们有着与平常不一样的心情，所做的一切都是为了让我们从日常的烦琐中脱离。但我难道不应该跳出这个游戏，衷心地感谢我所拥有的一切吗？”

在科特说话的时候，阿德尔海德睁开了双眼，然后又闭上。她听到了科特所说的，但却没有意识到这话是对她讲的。

“是谁把爱情置于法律之外？如果我脑子里想着为了爱情杀死同类，毫无疑问我在进行犯罪幻想。如果我说出了我的誓词，然后想着将来可以不履行，我就不是一个绅士。但我的心可以肆意而为。”

“是的。”阿德尔海德附和道。

她说这话的时候脑子一片空白，科特也没有听到她的话。

“我们知道，有些人，他们有权利让成百上千的人去死；有些人，他们的激情像赤红的火焰一样直冲天空并照亮大地，吞噬一切挡路之物。诗人歌颂这样的激情，每个人心中都供奉着这样一座神龛。但，如果有人在市政厅广场大街上扮演拿破仑，我们会绞死他。那为什么每两个女人中就有一个会把自己视为海洛薇姿(1)？”

科特陷入自己的椅子里，盯着眼前，“我不知道，是否一次伟大的焰火抵得上成千的微小灯光。我在想，有人知道答案吗？有人能够测量出来吗？”

阿德尔海德挪了挪位置，科特转头看着她，专注地看着她。她的眼睛温柔梦幻，她淡淡地笑了下，好似一个昏昏欲睡的孩子。

“如果真是那样，”科特声音压抑地说，“如果我真的无法控制我的心，”科特让自己的头重重地抵向椅子扶手，“如果爱情真的让我开心、自信，让我将自己和自己家庭的生活都建立在此基础上；如果我的爱情会在我不知不觉的情况下终止，我不得不在另外一个男人的床上寻找我孩子的母亲，那我为什么还要我的妻子出去见人？为什么我不把她锁起来，就像土耳其人那样？或者，在她生下小孩后，我就杀了她？”

科特站起来，开始在屋子里走来走去，渐渐地，他平静下来，“但不是这样的，让那伟大的爱情保持它们的伟大，让诗人歌颂它们，让那微不足道的现代人卑微地模仿它们。希望还是有女人一生只奉献于一个男人，而这些男人也会永久爱着她们。”

他站在壁炉边，看过整个屋子。四下都很安静，教堂的钟敲了两下。

“你看，阿德尔海德，生活会越来越多地进入法律的管辖内。每一天，一方的自由都是以侵犯另一方的权利为代价。国家，与法律无关，但却受法律的制约。没有园丁的同意，花儿不会开花。家畜不能随便选择它们的伴侣。但没有人能控制自己的心，然后人类就像狗一样在大街上交配。”

当科特从他的沉思中醒来，壁炉里的火已几近熄灭。

他看到阿德尔海德已经睡着了。他在她身前站了很久，充满了对她和自己的同情。

然后，科特轻轻抚摸了阿德尔海德的头发，说：

“太晚了，阿德尔海德。”

第八章


“真希望我们没有结婚，科特。”阿德尔海德说。

她双臂交叉在胸前，那双深邃的黑色眼睛望着科特。

“我希望我是你的情人。做情人的话，我们的关系会在黎明时分结束，不会有这些不愉快，也不会有恐惧。而我们享受的快乐会更美好。”

科特站在壁炉旁，摆弄着他口袋里的钥匙。

“那样，你会有光滑的额头，明亮的眼睛，因为你会跟我做爱。”

科特抬头望着阿德尔海德，温柔地说：

“难道我跟你不做爱吗，阿德尔海德？”

阿德尔海德叹气，没再说什么。科特坐了下来，过了许久，问道：

“阿德尔海德，你听到我刚才说的了吗？”

“我更希望听到你接下来要说什么。”

“我最近在一本书里看到跟你刚才说的类似的话，”科特说，“我忘记那书叫什么名字。书中作者痛责婚姻，以及它所象征的安全感，它的习俗等等。这样的观点在好多书里不断重复。”

“是的，那些作者总是唱老调，”阿德尔海德回答道，“这观点当然并不讨好，但我敢说，它有它合理的地方。”

科特轻轻地拍了拍双手说：“如今的诗人想象力贫乏得可怜，这真奇怪。就好像世界上就那么几个女人，他们还跟这些女人结了婚，然后又从她们身边跑开了。我很惊讶，歌颂传统这件事从来没在他们脑子里出现过。”

科特向前拉了拉他的椅子，双手抱头，看着壁炉说：

“如果我是个诗人，我会歌颂赞美神圣的传统。”

“你会吗，科特？”

“是，是的，我会。”

此刻，科特背靠在椅子上，听着烟囱里大风的呜呜声，说：

“你看，阿德尔海德，两个人被这世界上最强大的力量驱使而拥抱彼此。白昼与黑夜，时间与地点对于他们而言都已不存在。整个大地都充满紫罗兰的芬芳。他们的快乐是一种恐惧，这恐惧又充满了狂喜的欢乐。之后，一个小婴儿会躺在女人的膝盖上，她眼里的光芒更加深邃。时间流逝，大地上的紫罗兰越来越少。她承受分娩之痛给予孩子生命，这种痛损耗了她的容颜。孩子吸干了她的乳汁，她的眼睛由于经常熬夜而干涩。路过的陌生人只会看到一个青春已逝的女人。但他，那个被女人年轻时的眼睛迷倒、亲吻过女人坚挺的乳房的男人，他眼里的女人不是那样的。他早已习惯了女人的存在。她平息了他年轻的欲望，取而代之，她给了他平静的快乐。”

科特沉默了一会儿。然后，他转向阿德尔海德，接着说：

“他再不会像过去那样渴望那些激情约会的时刻了，而会寻找她身边那个他早已习惯的睡椅。习惯已将两人捆成了一个家庭。这难道不美好吗，阿德尔海德？”

“是的，很美好，正如你说的那样。但那不是青春。”

“那什么是青春，阿德尔海德？”

“青春是不安稳。”

“那人们不应该在年老之前结婚，因为婚姻就是安稳。深沉的，有力的，快乐的……带来安稳。”

“确实不应该，”阿德尔海德回答，“这也正是为什么我希望我是你的情人。”

阿德尔海德说这些话的时候看着科特，科特也看着她。

然后科特站起来，手放在阿德尔海德椅子的后背上，俯下身对她说：

“我们之间已经变得太陌生了！”

阿德尔海德伤心地点点头，科特穿过屋子，站在壁炉旁，“我从各个角度说明我的想法，都是徒劳。我祖先搭建的这间屋子毫无益处，他的后代在这里，一代又一代的见证，没有任何意义。”

一阵疾风吹来，将阳台门吹开。

阿德尔海德打了个寒战，看向阳台，科特走了过去，关上了阳台门。之后，他站在天球仪旁，按下了按键，“我经常想起那个把这玩具放在这里的可怜人。他的社交圈无法满足他，于是他失去了理智，将自己的精力全部放在摆弄这些星星上。对于我们现代人来讲，正好是相反的，我们发疯是因为社交圈太大了。我们把这些星星留给孩子们玩了。我们去摆弄更大的玩具。当然，要是有兴趣，我们可以与上帝较量一下……如果我们还没玩腻那玩意儿的话！我们不敢说爱，我们嘲笑婚姻。我们蔑视勇气，不相信诚实，对于道德，我们每个人都有自己的一套说辞。”

阿德尔海德漫不经心地听着，如同人们听音乐那般，并不介意是否听清楚了每个音符。

“然后，碰巧我们渴望在我们生活中有一个固定的点。只是那么一个点，无法被批驳被讨论，无法成为过去。”

科特坐了下来，在他的椅子里挪来挪去，无法安定。

“如果我能在这屋里放置任何东西的话，”科特说，“我打算从远方的乡下挪一座小房子放在这里。这幢小房子有一个门，两个窗户。夜晚，烟囱里炊烟袅袅。房子要尽可能地小，但那是为了显示屋内无法容纳任何疑虑。丈夫和妻子会一起进进出出这个房子，直到他们生命的最后一天。”

现在，阿德尔海德终于听清了科特的话，她望着科特。

“那才是我应该有的婚姻，阿德尔海德。如果我有任何才能，如果我得为了生活而工作，我敢说我对婚姻的期待会有所不同。我跟其他男人没什么两样，既没有更加强壮，也没有更加勇敢。我不了解上帝，对人类也没有过多的信仰。”

科特降低了自己的音量，说话的时候并没有看着阿德尔海德。但阿德尔海德知道，科特希望听到她说点儿什么，然而她的心在哭泣，因为她没有任何能对科特说的话。

“我的固定点。”科特说。

之后，他沉默了一会儿。但不久，科特就站了起来，手臂搭在阿德尔海德的椅子上，说道：

“我曾经在家里经常看到这样的场景。父亲和母亲非常和蔼，非常坚强。他们现在就在我眼前，就像以前那样在晚饭后相互亲吻对方，不管周围还有多少客人在场。他们会互相亲吻对方问候早安和晚安，直到他们死去。当我父亲和他的哥哥在大街上遇到，他们总是亲吻对方。人们总是大笑。这曾是多么美好的习惯。”

当科特说话的时候，阿德尔海德试图打断他。

“我对家人的感情一直很强烈，”科特说道，“直到现在也是这样。不过，我也曾有过一位情人。”

科特停了下来。阿德尔海德坐起来看着他。她的眼睛闪烁着光芒。

“或者只是一种肉体关系，如果你喜欢这样归类的话。”

“你从未告诉过我这些！”阿德尔海德说。

科特抬头看着阿德尔海德，而阿德尔海德垂下了眼睑。

“没什么可说的啊。”科特说。

然后，科特没再说什么，他向窗户那边走去。

阿德尔海德又一次在这巨大的古老的椅子里感到渺小而局促。





第九章


科特站在门槛处，等待。但随后他又关上屋门，走向壁炉那里。

科特穿着正装，疲惫而脸色苍白，但他的眼睛因为喝过酒显得明亮。在壁炉旁坐了一会儿后，科特觉得燥热无比，于是他把椅子挪到了阳台门那儿，坐在那里摆弄那些红色的花朵。

当阿德尔海德走进来时，并没有看到科特。

她缓缓移动到了屋子正中央，看到科特并没有在壁炉旁，感到十分惊奇，但不久就忘记了这一点，沉浸在夜晚消遣的欢乐和兴奋中，满脑子都是那些机灵、讨巧的话语，灯光在她的眼睛里闪闪发光。

阿德尔海德坐到钢琴前，前额抵在键盘上。她内心正在欢唱，她的一只脚随之轻轻地在地板上打起拍子。

然后，阿德尔海德找了个小调，唱了起来：

丽诺尔，我心如刀绞。

你如此大胆年轻。

告诉我，丽诺尔，让事实坦白；

（我从来都猜不到）：

你灵魂的泉水何时喷涌？

大山在哪里下沉，溪谷在哪里高耸？

告诉我，让事实坦白；

向我打开你年轻的门。



丽诺尔，我心感悲伤。

你如此开心如此坚定。

教给我你那平静的步态；

教给我欢笑和伤悲。

我的心是一片沙漠，荒凉贫瘠；

我的心属于你，你在那里低语。

一个明天将要喷涌的泉水，

一轮将要镀上上帝光辉的太阳。

阿德尔海德一只手放在一份乐谱上，另外一只手弹着钢琴，又哼了一遍。

此时，科特赞赏地鼓起掌来。阿德尔海德吓了一跳，手重重地落在键盘上。

“吓死我了，科特！”

科特走了过来，站在钢琴旁。阿德尔海德看着他的脸，叹了口气。然后她站起来，不再弹奏钢琴，坐到了壁炉旁的椅子里，“科特，你不到这边来吗？”

科特在屋里不停地走来走去。

“在这里坐一会儿。”阿德尔海德说。

“为什么我要坐下来？”科特问，“你并不在这里，你知道的。”

阿德尔海德望着科特那沉静的眼睛。

“你还在楼下客厅里，在我们那群客人中间。难道你没有意识到吗，阿德尔海德？走出大门的那些马车都是空的。因为，每当有客人来跟你说再见时，你都会要求他们再待一会儿。”

阿德尔海德叹了口气，双手交握放在膝盖上。科特站在壁炉旁，想要看到阿德尔海德的脸。

“当你进来时，我就坐在那儿，在那些花的中间，我都看见了。你进来的时候带着微光和沙沙声，伴随你的是那一大群客人……你是他们中最漂亮的。你旁边走着马顿斯，灵活帅气。后面远远地跟着的是他的妻子……那个眼神总是很疲惫，笑容充满苦涩的女人。她都没看到她的丈夫在向谁献殷勤。”

她皱了皱眉头，生气地看着科特。

“然后，马顿斯恳求你再唱一遍这首歌，客人们全都簇拥着你，跟他一样哀求你。你穿过屋子，步子缓慢而自信。你总是这样走路，阿德尔海德，好像一个无法被阻止的人。你白色的裙摆在你身后拖行，屋子里全都安静下来。”

科特停顿了一会儿。阿德尔海德将头靠回椅子里，闭上了眼睛。

“然后你唱了他要求你唱的歌，就是那首几分钟前你在老钢琴上边弹边唱的歌。是的，你听到我鼓掌了，阿德尔海德。马顿斯站在你身旁，看着你，无比恭敬开心。你望向他的眼睛，在那里反射出你是多么的魅力无敌。”

“你把这一切说得真邪恶！”阿德尔海德说。

科特向她弯下腰说：

“看着我，阿德尔海德。”

她看着他，感到害怕。

“你怎么敢带着你的追随者们进这个屋子？”科特问，“来这儿？来见我？在这间屋子？看着我，阿德尔海德。这房子其他地方的空间还不够大吗？这城市里你能随意玩你喜欢的这类游戏的地方还不够多吗？”

阿德尔海德向他伸出手：

“科特！”

但科特怒目圆睁，她不敢直视。

然后，她在科特面前站起来，低着头。

“我能走吗，科特？”她轻声地问。

科特没有回答，径直穿过屋子。阿德尔海德坐在大椅子的边缘，就好像她并不是在自己家一样。

“是的，马顿斯。”科特说。

“你今晚对他非常不友好，科特。”

她说这话仅仅是为了说些什么，当她想都没想地脱口而出时便后悔起来，可怜兮兮地看了一眼科特。但科特做了个手势，平静地说：

“事实上我对他已经很友好了，尽他所愿地友好，甚至比我想象的还要友好一些。”

科特站在壁炉架旁，低头看着前方。阿德尔海德拉着他的手，放在自己的脸上。

“马顿斯对我来说什么都不是。”她说。

“不，”科特否定道，“不完全是。不是特指那个男人，而是男人们。现在还没有发展成那样，但已经向前发展了。”

“我不明白你在说什么。”阿德尔海德伤心地说。

“不是一个男人，一个好男人或坏男人，在向你求爱，赢得了或正在试图赢得你的心。马顿斯不是我的敌人。他不爱你，他也没有试图要让你相信他爱你。他并不撒谎。不撒谎这种品质，除了在下等阶级中，已经不被提倡了。我们这群人中，连丑闻的影子都看不到。我们应该从何处获取力量，让我们可以与这社会割裂、隔离或者从这里逃离？是从一位告诉他的女孩她是他唯一的挚爱的士兵那里；是从一位杀死不忠诚的爱人，名叫史密斯的工匠那里；是从一个被爱人抛弃，跳水自尽的农场女孩那里。”

科特抽走了他的手，双臂交叉在胸前。

“马顿斯不是唐璜。让女人着迷的并非他的激情，也不是他男儿的勇气和力量。他将欲望发泄在后街那里，他的妻子是用来陪他吃饭的。他无法去爱。他觊觎的女人全部会属于他，但他从未属于任何女人。他的眼睛，他的话语，他歌颂爱情的小曲儿，再加上他那迷人的略带忧伤的气质，没什么女人能够抵挡。然后他把头放在女人的膝盖上，向女人诉说他那亘古不变的渴望和失望。他向女人吐露心声，求她不要背叛他。之后，女人便会爱上他。女人就成了他的囊中物，任他摆布。”

阿德尔海德试图插话，但科特摇头示意不让她说话，她只好叹口气，继续沉默。

“马顿斯不再年轻，但这不会有任何影响。他从未年轻。他那不受约束的多情，他时刻准备为爱献身，这让他在那些女人的眼里显得年轻，就好像他是一个穿着男人衣服的女人。他那软弱无力、贪图感官享受的气质渗透了他身体和灵魂的每一处，以至于他所说的话、他的眼神和想法都受到了影响。他毫无意志，乏味至极，且没有诚信。他虽从不感到饥饿，却贪得无厌。他吞下女人，然后又把她们吐出来，让她们带着病态的欲望、消沉的意气和所剩无几的力量继续过她们的生活。”

“科特！科特！他对于我来说是什么？对于我们来说是什么？”

科特看着阿德尔海德，沉默了一会儿，接着说道：

“马顿斯照看那个你会摘花的花园。他是首席园丁。但他仅仅是千万人之一。总的来说，这些追求激情的人都差不多。需要我把他们介绍给你吗？”

“不，科特。”

“我能告诉你他们的名字，这样就不会伤害到他们。当你见到他们，你会认出他们来，你会立刻认出他们。”

“科特！”

但科特并没有在听。

“你将记得那个男人，虽然我们都知道他有众多的情人，但我们无法当着他的面说什么。他经常带新人来，所以他的情人越来越多，因为他也从不放走那些旧相好。”

“够了，科特。”

“还有个男人，他告诉他那些漂亮的朋友，这一生他只爱过一个女性，那就是他母亲。你有没有注意过母亲在这些筋疲力尽的男人的想象中所扮演的角色？在他们的记录里，他们的爱情中，母亲象征了他们早晨的头痛和性障碍。母亲就是用来抚平他们那堕落的思想的。他们轻轻呼唤着他们母亲的名字，当他们亲吻怀中那甜美的人儿时。我不知道这对谁来说是更大的侮辱，这吻是给母亲的，还是给情人的？”

阿德尔海德试图站起来，但恰巧这时经过的科特离她太近以致她无法移动。于是，阿德尔海德继续坐在那里，疲惫而痛苦，而科特满屋子走，说话的时候一会儿站在这儿，一会儿站在那儿，“我们的妻子属于这些男人，他们并不把这些妻子带走，所以我们无法为她们的离去而伤心，也无法娶新的妻子将她们替代。这些男人咀嚼了我们精心呵护、使其茁壮成长的爱情之树的顶冠。”

此刻，阿德尔海德在科特面前站了起来，满眼泪水，嘴唇颤抖，“科特！”

但科特苍白的脸上满是怒气，阿德尔海德竟说不出一句话。

“我让你想笑吗，阿德尔海德？”科特问。

阿德尔海德回到自己在烟囱旁的位置，再次坐了下来。

“你熄灭了我所有的灯。”阿德尔海德说。

科特穿过屋子，自顾自地继续说道：

“当这些人看上了某个人的妻子，那个人的真爱将付之东流。然后，他就降级为简单的丈夫，一个无聊笨拙的人，一个名不符实的拥有者。然后，在我妻子的脑海里出现了对一些她没有拥有的事物的渴望。她的平静转化成疲倦，婚姻所带给她的爱变成了空洞的习惯。她放弃。那些愚蠢的书里的愚蠢话语在她耳朵里唱歌。她知道，没有什么爱能够长久，婚姻是可憎的。烦躁的叹息在她的灵魂处升起，让她日也苦闷，夜也忧伤。她把真爱的黄金兑换成一把把小硬币，然后在灯光亮起、音乐响起的地方随意挥霍一空。”

科特双手扶着脖子，站在阿德尔海德的椅子附近，看着前方。

“阿德尔海德，”科特说，“我无法理解引起这种情况的男人还能在我们中间自由走动，而且我们还敬他们为尊贵的客人。当我们看到一个可怜的瘸子，我们会抑制不住要打个冷战，难道我说的不对吗，阿德尔海德？我们讨厌看到一张充满痛苦的脸。但与那些男人相比，我们眼前这些本该让人避之不及的人却闪耀着光芒，展现出无人能比的美丽。”

科特来来回回走了一会儿，时间流逝，屋子里充满寂静。

之后他坐在他放在阳台门旁的椅子上，被红色的花朵包围。

科特觉得疲乏无力，于是闭上了眼睛。时不时，有一辆马车驶过广场或一阵叫喊声划破夜的寂静，他睁开眼睛。然后他再次闭上眼，陷入充满烦躁且痛苦的困倦中。

然后，他突然坐起来。

阿德尔海德躺在他前面的地板上，她的脸靠着他的膝盖。她的泪水浸湿了他的手掌。

“请不要生我的气，科特！”

科特看着她，但什么都没有说。

“科特，你说的那些，都是真的。我也很认同，这一切都那么美好。”

科特向后推了推椅子，站了起来：

“阿德尔海德，小心你所做的事情。我不是一个时髦的说教者，激怒你然后又去安慰你。我也不是一个诗人，在给你朗诵他最后的作品。我是你的丈夫，现在要求你解释。”

科特穿过屋子，然后又走回来，抚摸阿德尔海德的头发。

“这已超出了我们的能力，阿德尔海德，”科特悲伤地说道，“上帝帮帮我们！”

阿德尔海德托着科特的手，用力地盖住自己的眼睛，弄得她生疼。

“如果那个过时的上帝还在这里，我们不妨跪下来，双手合十，就像盖起这屋子的人那样，向他祷告。这样难道不好吗，阿德尔海德？”

“是的。”

“我向上帝求告，向超出我个人力量的一切神明求告，向楼下的我们的孩子求告。”





第十章


阿德尔海德躺在她椅子前的地板上，将她花环上的花朵撕成碎片。科特头倚着手，坐在旁边，看着那些花。

“但愿你能说点儿什么，科特，但愿你能问我点儿什么。你为什么不问我点儿什么呢？”

“我能问你什么？”

“问问我在想什么。我为什么回来得这么早。为什么我这么久都没有来过这里。”

“我都知道，阿德尔海德。”

阿德尔海德双手交叉放在她的膝盖上，身子摇来摇去，用那双黝黑的眼睛生气地望着科特，“有什么是你不知道的吗，科特？”

“没有。”

“我也这么觉得。你知道这大千世界里所有一切事情的对错。你从不疑虑，也从不觉得迷茫。你立刻就能辨别一切的对错，然后你会毫不犹豫地做正确的选择。”

科特摇摇头，什么都没说，而阿德尔海德变得更加生气，“只有你无所不知。那些不顺从你意见的人都消失了。这房子里，除了你和那些为你服务的人，根本没有给其他的人预留一点儿空间。”

科特将阿德尔海德从地板上提了起来。

“安静一会儿，阿德尔海德，”科特说，“安静一小会儿。”

但阿德尔海德再次滑倒在地板上，蔑视地看着科特。

“我不会坐在那把椅子里，”她说，“再也不会坐那椅子了。我不配这样的荣誉。你并不是什么都懂，科特。你不了解我。”

科特用手摸了摸阿德尔海德的头发，强迫她抬起头。

“那么，让我了解你。”科特说道。

阿德尔海德挣脱科特的束缚，眼睛变得湿润起来：

“你千万不要对我好。你不了解我。我不是你想象的那个女人。”

然后阿德尔海德把头靠在椅子上，轻轻地说：

“我是如此悲伤，科特。”

“你会开心起来的。”

“我敢说，”阿德尔海德回答道，“我会长久地悲伤。”

阿德尔海德捡起毁掉的花环放在椅子上，她的脸贴着椅子，眼睛闭着。科特看着她——她看起来如此疲惫——他们俩陷入长久的沉默。然后，阿德尔海德说：

“这里可真冷。”

接着，沉默再次降临。

“科特！”

阿德尔海德坐在地板上，背靠着椅子，眼睛盯着壁火，神情诡异，说道：

“科特，你知道吗？有时，当我在外面正开心的时候，我好像听到了小孩子的哭声。”

科特仍旧沉默。

“我听到小孩子们的哭声，科特。有时在我跳舞的时候。有时在我唱歌的时候。有的时候在剧院，灯光明亮，人流涌动，我很开心，然后，我就经常听到……我听到小孩子们在哭，远远地，但我还是可以清晰地听到，我不自禁就会听到。科特，你知道是为什么吗？”

“是的，我知道，阿德尔海德。”

阿德尔海德看着他，眼睛再次转向壁炉说：

“有时，发生的情况不一样。当我听到一个孩子在哭……确实是一个孩子在哭……一个陌生的孩子，跟我一点儿关系都没有，我对他什么都不知道，我甚至不需要看他，科特，但之后我自己也禁不住哭起来。”

阿德尔海德沉默了一阵，然后转向科特，问道：

“你知道那是什么吗，科特？”

科特平静地看着她，说道：

“是的，我知道，阿德尔海德。”

“我不知道，”阿德尔海德说道，轻轻地摇了摇头，“我爱我们的儿子，也非常乐意他跟我在一起。难道不是这样吗，科特？”

“是。”

“但他跟老玛丽在一起的时候更快乐。他更喜欢跟她在一起。当我进来的时候，他向我伸出他那双小手。但当我抱了他一会儿，他就想去找老玛丽。他还那么小。”

“是。”

“有时他无论怎样都不肯亲我，但他总是亲吻老玛丽。”

“当老玛丽去世的时候，我们会给她的坟墓立块碑。在这碑上，我们就写‘这里躺着孩子们曾愿意亲吻的人’。”科特说道。

阿德尔海德双手搂着脖子，仰头看着天花板，“曾经，你总是跟我讲你的母亲。那是很久很久以前的事了，科特。那时，你那么爱谈她，为什么你现在不这么做了？”

“我现在只想你。”

阿德尔海德向科特这边挪了挪，把头靠在了他的膝盖上，“我能这样躺着么，科特？”

科特轻抚她的头发，他的手留在了她的肩头。

“这样很好。”阿德尔海德说。

科特看着她的头发，又摸了摸。阿德尔海德闭上眼，依偎在他身旁。

“这儿很安静，”阿德尔海德说，“现在我想去睡觉了。”

但突然，她又变得焦躁不安起来。阿德尔海德跪在地上，双手撑着膝盖。她的头发散落在肩膀上，眼睛盯着壁炉里的火苗，“你曾告诉我，你还是小孩子的时候，你的母亲会每晚给你脱衣服，每个早晨会给你穿衣服。”

“是的。”

“你说，这总会造成她去剧院迟到。或者，当餐桌上还有客人的时候她就会离开。你父亲曾为此生她的气。”

科特点点头。

“我觉得你父亲是对的，”阿德尔海德说，“我觉得你母亲有点儿怪，有点儿……有点儿不自然。”

科特将额前的头发捋到后面，什么都没说。

“我知道，你想让我做同样的事情。但是我做不到。我做不来老玛丽所做的，我也不觉得只有那样才能是个好母亲。你还告诉我，有一天晚上，当你母亲不得不出门，你一直不停地哭泣，直到她回来。”

“是的。”

“但如果你母亲像我一样，如果是老玛丽天天哄你睡觉，那么你将会为老玛丽而流眼泪了。”

“没错，”科特回答，“但由妈妈做这件事情对于我和她自己都是有益的。”

“我不理解。”阿德尔海德说。

但随即，她抬起头，用她那大大的充满骄傲的眼睛看着他说：

“哦，我懂了。我明白了，这样对一个男人是好的，让他看到他的妻子被她的孩子拴住，能够让他更加自信。”

“没错，阿德尔海德。”

科特静静地、伤心地看着阿德尔海德，那眼神立刻让她那点儿反抗的念头土崩瓦解。

“你说得好奇怪，科特。”

然后她重新将头倚靠在科特的膝盖上，两人沉默了一阵子，之后，阿德尔海德说道：

“我记得我去第一场成人舞会的那个晚上。一位女士来我家为我梳妆打扮。我对此非常郑重，那位女士却滔滔不绝。她告诉我，我很漂亮，一定会很快就嫁出去，因此，我必须抓紧时间一刻不停地跳舞。因为，一旦一个女孩嫁了出去，她就不得不放弃跳舞。我问她说这话是什么意思，因为我认识很多结婚的女士都依然跳舞。然后她告诉我，确实有很多女人婚后继续跳舞，但她们跳死了自己的孩子，因此那是极大的罪过。”

科特在椅子上动了动。阿德尔海德抬了抬头，说道：

“你相信我们能跳死我们的孩子吗，科特？”

科特没有回答，摸了摸她的脸。但阿德尔海德把他的手推开，转向科特，“你信吗，科特？”

科特点了点头。

之后，阿德尔海德笨拙地从地板上站起来，站在科特面前。她缓慢地抬起胳膊，双手压在自己的太阳穴上。

科特迅速站起来，紧紧地握住阿德尔海德的手，把她抱入怀中。但阿德尔海德挣脱了科特的拥抱，眼神空洞地看着科特。

“阿德尔海德！”

“那些是你和我的孩子，科特，当我开心的时候，那些小孩子就开始哭泣，那些因为母亲跳舞而死去的孩子。”

“阿德尔海德！”

科特的声音和眼神都极其温柔，阿德尔海德盯着那双眼睛，在那深邃中看到一丝光芒。她明白，科特心里很开心，因为他认为他以自己想要的方式得到了她。

科特向阿德尔海德伸出手，他的眼睛、他那沉默的颤抖的嘴巴都在对阿德尔海德诉说着情话。阿德尔海德僵硬地站着，冷眼望着科特。

当他的手触碰到阿德尔海德时，阿德尔海德从他身边缩了回来，把自己的椅子向后推了很远，就好像她要为自己找到足够的空间。

“你不懂我。”阿德尔海德说。

阿德尔海德穿过屋子走到阳台门那里，然后又折回到壁炉旁，科特在那儿坐着。她看科特的眼神似乎是在看一个陌生人。

“那些哭泣的小孩，”阿德尔海德说，“他们在哭什么？”

科特抬起手，放在椅子的扶手上。

“他们为什么哭？”阿德尔海德重复道，“是因为他们没有出生在一个看到其美丽的同时却被拒之门外的世界，还是因为他们不是生来就注定要死的？”

阿德尔海德在房间里走了一圈又坐回到椅子里，神情严肃，就好像她不得不向一个理解迟钝的人解释什么。

“没有用。”她说道。

阿德尔海德的声音冷酷。她的身体摆来摆去，脑子里搜索着词语，以便可以一次性表达清楚她的意思，不会被误解。

她的眼光落在科特身上，科特坐在她的旁边，筋疲力尽地闭着眼睛，双手无力地垂着。她看到了她带给科特的痛苦。她希望能够解除这痛苦，修复他们的关系，想着这些，眼泪潸然而落，“科特！”

阿德尔海德握住科特那双毫无力气的手。

“难道你不能帮帮我吗？”

“不能，阿德尔海德。”

听到这回答，阿德尔海德的心情再次发生了变化。她狠狠地坐回到椅子里，双臂交叉在胸前。

“那么，我必须自我拯救，”她说道，“你，或者，一个老……是的，一个像你这样的老人？”

科特没有回答，没有反应，没有看她。

“一个像你一样的老人，”阿德尔海德重复道，“只渴望着平静、安详，对其他毫无欲望。那样，你耗尽了最棒的快乐，也是最便宜、最易得的、最适于家庭的快乐。”

科特坐直了上身，手紧抓着膝盖，眼睛充满怒火。

“你把你爱的女人放到你母亲的坐榻上，也是你祖母还有你曾祖母的坐榻上。”

科特从椅子上跳了起来，双手叉腰，紧咬着嘴唇说道：

“闭上你的嘴！”

阿德尔海德吓了一跳，双眼惊恐地看着他，说道：

“你没有权利对我说这话。”

科特重新坐回到椅子里，脑袋靠着椅背，脸扭向另外一边。阿德尔海德如此疲惫，她找不到她想要的词语，所表达的意思都不是她想要表达的，口气也不是她所想象的那样。

当科特在她身边渐渐冷静下来，阿德尔海德的思维也清晰了起来，她意识到，除非她说出最狠的话，似乎没有别的方法了。然后，为了给自己鼓劲，她握紧拳头，闭上眼睛，一口气说道：

“你必须知道事情的真相，科特。你所看到的，所说的，都是真的。我欺骗了你，科特。我撒了谎，每次我来这里，和你坐在一起，我都会撒谎。”

阿德尔海德看着科特。科特费力地抬起头，看着阿德尔海德的眼睛，然后，他转头看向别的地方。

“你现在还在撒谎。”他说。

阿德尔海德张开嘴，又闭上，上下牙齿撞了一下。

然后，她双手交叉放在膝盖上，弯下腰，哭泣道：

“我自己都不知道。”

科特站起来穿过屋子，缓慢而又疲惫不堪，头脑一片空白。阿德尔海德的泪水不断落在她的膝盖上。

他们虽然同在这屋子里，却又独立于彼此，丝毫不怜悯对方。他们的心已死去，他们的思想瘫痪。他们不再是彼此相爱一起追求幸福的两个人，他们甚至不为即将到来的分别而感到生气或遗憾。他们仅仅是被判了死刑的两个人，碰巧被关在同一间牢房里，除此之外，这两人再无共同之处。

科特首先回过神来。

他站在阿德尔海德椅子的背后，阿德尔海德发丝的香味唤醒了他。他向阿德尔海德弯下腰去，记起了她是谁。科特看着阿德尔海德的手已被眼泪浸湿，此刻，科特的心也碎了。

那一刻，科特突然意识到，如果他不想跟阿德尔海德分开，他必须给予她怜悯。而当他明白这一点时，他立刻知道，他已永远地失去了阿德尔海德。

科特坐在自己的椅子里，搜索着他应该说的话。他感觉自己好像一个演员，要在这场表演中诉说结束语，然而观众已经开始离席，因为这场演出的结局已然明朗，表演的张力已经消失。

“阿德尔海德！”科特喊道。

这是他唯一能说出口的。阿德尔海德明白科特内心的想法，无言以对，默默地流着眼泪。

夜晚悄无声息地降临。

阿德尔海德又一次躺在了地板上，她的脸靠在科特的膝盖处。她急切地说着，断断续续地，并不在乎说了什么，只求把想要说的都说出来。

科特头倚着手，他浓密的头发散落在额头上。科特闭上眼，又睁开，对阿德尔海德的话，左耳朵进，右耳朵出，时不时做出回应，心里只有一个念头，就是这一切结束了。

“除了你之外，还有其他男人。你说的是真的，都是真的。哦，科特，我能跟你说吗，尽管这事很邪恶？你会温和地对我吗？你能理解吗，那不是不忠诚。”

阿德尔海德紧握双手，绝望地摇头说：

“是的，是的，是不忠，科特，是这样的。我现在明白了。我能告诉你吗，科特，我可以吗？我爱他们眼中的渴望，我对那渴望很好奇，我不觉得有什么耻辱，我在那眼神中觉得开心，我甚至试图点燃那眼神。”

“这些事情，不该跟你的丈夫诉说，阿德尔海德。”

阿德尔海德看着科特，“那么，我应该对谁说？”

“这些事情应该埋藏起来。”

“哦，好吧，但我要把它们说出来。我会说出来。因为我面对的是你，还因为，你询问我这些事情，科特，你看到了这些事情，想要拯救我。这就是你跟我讨论这些的原因，不是吗？我以前不知道，现在我知道了，现在我没有撒谎。但是我以前不知道，在你说之前。而且，对于我来说，这并没有更丑陋，反而是更好的。科特，科特，这并没有那么丑陋。”

阿德尔海德将脸埋在双手中，抽泣到无法说话，“哦，科特，实际情况比我说的还要糟糕。你为什么不把我逐出家门？要是你不在世了就好了，科特！为什么你要这么不快乐？为什么是我让你这么不快乐？如果你抛弃我，这是我罪有应得。可我知道我爱的是你，我从前不曾明白，但我现在意识到，你才是我命中注定的人。”

阿德尔海德抓着科特的衣服努力站了起来，她那苍白的脸贴近科特：

“科特，难道你不能等等我吗？我已经赶来了。”

说完这话，阿德尔海德松开了抓着科特衣角的手，瘫到了地板上。

“不，不，我做不了你期望我做的事。”

科特站在阿德尔海德面前，望着壁炉里的火苗，说：

“阿德尔海德，是你的意志出了问题。”

科特穿过屋子，站在阳台门那里，望向外面。然后他又走了回来，坐到自己的椅子上，说道：

“你知道那伟大的欢乐在哪里。你知道，我们会沉浸在这伟大的欢乐里，如果你能够得到它。但是你不能。你没有自己的判断力。一切事物对于你来说就是很近或很远，很小或很大。你就像马顿斯以及其他那些人一样。你是他们中的一员，因为你的意志脆弱，和他们一样。你正在转变成他们那样的人。”

“不，科特。”

“是的，你跟他们一模一样。你是个女人，优雅大方，因此你害怕深陷泥潭。但你属于他们。你和我是不共戴天的敌人。如果你是我儿子选定的妻子，我会为他的幸福极其担忧。你有你要找的幸福。不，全世界的幸福都是你的。当你足够年轻能够抵挡酒精而又足够成熟知道它的好处时，你才会把酒杯端到唇边。”

科特捋了捋额头的头发，向四周看了看，说道：

“没什么可说的了。你是这个时代的孩子，这个时代养育了你。以后，再带你来这房间也没有什么意义了。”

“不，科特。”

“但你很聪明，你有教养，你已经看到了这房间伟大而无声的美丽。有一天，你会明白，快乐就在你原来待过的地方，但你却执意去远方寻找。”

“是的，科特。”

“你会看到那一天的到来。但那时一切都太迟了。到那时，时光都已流逝，老钢琴的琴键已经生锈不能发声，纺车轮子布满灰尘，壁炉里的火也都熄灭。那时，你的想象陷入惶恐，困惑不堪，就像那只不停冲着窗户栅栏扑打翅膀的鸟。你会丢失信仰，你的谦逊化为不贞。”

科特站起来走到阳台门处。阿德尔海德脸靠着壁炉栅栏，双眼紧闭。

房间里的空气仿佛凝结，被沉默吞噬。他们彼此都感受到了这沉默所带来的痛，然而当死亡即将来临，痛感已经变得麻木。他们不再抗拒命运，不再抗拒胜过他们的力量。他们疲惫不堪，甚至都没有想过所遭受的溃败，而是在得到的平静中微笑起来。




夜晚飞逝。

科特和阿德尔海德坐在稀奇的古董椅子里，看着余火在壁炉中熄灭。蜡烛也几乎燃尽。

两人温柔安静，好像上次有不同意见的时候是好多年以前了。两人表情镇静，当他们彼此相望，眼神清澈而悲伤，但不再渴望，也没有愤怒和痛苦。

他们看着彼此，聊着刚刚结束的一切。

他们的话语不再带着锋芒。科特握着阿德尔海德的手，像好朋友那样。阿德尔海德甚至像对一个孩子般给科特捋了捋额头的发丝。

“如果有人看到我们坐在这里，他肯定不会明白我们之间发生了什么。”科特说道。

“没错。”

“如果有人听到我们在屋子里说的每句话，他可能会觉得我们是一对傻瓜。”

阿德尔海德摇了摇头：

“还好没有更糟糕的事情发生在我们身上。”

“我不确定。”科特回应道。

然后他放开阿德尔海德的手，挺直身体，说道：

“有时，我觉得，如果要是有什么具体行为需要被宽恕，或许会更容易些，一些可以忘记的事情，那么就不会结束了。”

“并没有结束，”阿德尔海德说，“我们错过了快乐，因为我没有遵守我应该遵守的标准。但我们还有儿子，他能娶到一位配得上坐在这里的妻子。”

“不。老屋子的作用已经消失了。它不再适应这时代，更不适应未来的时代。我们的儿子不会在这里目睹他的快乐支离破碎。”

说完这些之后过了一会儿，科特用手压住自己的太阳穴，非常小声地说：

“因为要一个人做令自己不快乐的事太难了。”




蜡烛终于熄灭了，一支接着一支。

“很晚了，阿德尔海德，我们走吧。”

“好的。”

但他俩谁都无法离开。

他们互相看了一眼彼此，陷入同样的沉思中，害怕结束这平静的夜晚，因为之后迎接他们的将是灾难的日子。




最后一根蜡烛燃尽。

科特的台灯仍旧亮着，但房间里的一切似乎都在灯光的摇曳下移动了位置。原来明亮的地方被黑暗替代，一大片黑影在墙上显现。

两人似乎都感受到神秘的力量，不由自主地靠近了一些。

“唱歌给我听吧，阿德尔海德。”

阿德尔海德走向钢琴，看着琴键。

“唱丽诺尔系列的最后一首。”

阿德尔海德转头看了看，但却看不清科特脸上的表情。

然后她唱道：

当死亡来临，来临，丽诺尔，

你是生命那红色的灯塔；

那光芒从你快乐的大眼睛中四射；

就在那一刻，死神也死去。

我从不属于死神，而是属于你；

我不流眼泪，也不曾抱怨；

将你那红唇放在我的唇上，

再带走你的灵魂。



我将最后一次看到，

我珍爱的光芒四射充满爱意的双眼；

是什么样的歌曲什么样的罪过，

我让他人去权衡考量。

但你不要忘记，

当夜色爬过窗格，

那羞涩的蓝色紫罗兰之香气，

甜美了一切简单朴素。

当阿德尔海德唱完时，科特站在她椅子背后。阿德尔海德并没有感觉到，她坐在钢琴前，手放在琴键上，不断地重复最后一句歌词。

科特看着她的头发，她的手，还有她那白色的连衣裙。他似乎刚刚意识到他失去了什么，也明白他再也不会拥有了。科特双手颤抖，眼睛发烫。他觉得他一定会杀了阿德尔海德还有他自己。

然后他念着她的名字。

阿德尔海德抬头看着他。

她忘记了一切，眼中只有他。科特从她那大而奇特的眼睛中、她那红艳的嘴唇里看到了这一切。

阿德尔海德跳了起来，开心地大叫，科特把她拥入怀中，带走了她。





第十一章


壁炉架上的蜡烛又亮了起来，那昏黄的灯光一如既往地穿过阳台洒在广场上。

房间外，广场上灯火辉煌，马车声响阵阵，但声音极其遥远，因为房子离广场还有一段距离，且房间的墙壁厚如城堡。

夜晚降临时，噪音消逝，在房间里便能听到喷泉的潺潺声，绵延不绝，还有哭喊声，没人知道那声音来自哪里，还有脚步声，渐渐靠近又渐渐远去。

科特站在壁炉旁，房间里空空荡荡的。

他盯着那些奇特的老古董原来伫立的地方，这些老家伙事儿目睹了他的家族一代又一代的子孙在这屋子里度过的时光。

科特记得这屋子里的每件物品，注视着每件物品原来摆放的位置，如今都已空空如也。他闭上眼，仿佛屋子里的一切又都重现：钢琴歌唱，阿德尔海德白色裙子的裙裾滑过地毯。

科特想到曾经盖这所房子和这房间的人，他把这个房间叫作这房子的灵魂、传统和密室。他想到所有那些把妻子带进这屋子的人，想到他第一次来这屋子的情景。

然后，他走过去打开了墙上藏着古老泛黄的羊皮纸的壁龛，上面写着每一个曾拥有这屋子的人和他的妻子的姓名。

科特读着房子建造者那朴素而亲切的记述。

他读了一遍又一遍，然后，他划掉了他和阿德尔海德的名字，门也不关地离开了房间。





第二部分　科特的儿子





第十二章


当科特讲完老屋子的故事，他站在窗户旁，望着广场远方，刚刚亮起的路灯旁暮色渐浓。

仆人悄无声息地进入房间，点燃吊灯，又悄无声息地离开。灯光照亮了屋子的每一处，散落在科特身上，此刻坐着的科特看着眼前的芬，而芬的眼睛也盯着科特。

但芬和科特的注意力却不在灯火阑珊处。

他们早已神游于老屋子的美好神秘中。他们听到外面寂静的广场上喷泉的潺潺声，看到阳台上如烈焰般的红色花朵。钢琴清爽的音符在他们的耳畔回响，阿德尔海德白色的礼裙轻轻滑过地板。

科特转身面向芬，在芬眼里，科特已是暮年；而在科特眼中，芬依旧是那个在摇篮里大笑着挥舞起一对小拳头的小孩子。

科特站起来，抓着芬的胳膊，一起走来走去，沉默不语，他们被看到的景象征服，生怕一说话那脑海中的梦就破碎了。

他们走了一会儿，最后，停在了窗户前，玻璃上满是水汽，挡住了他们的视线。科特想起来，还有一些事情应该让芬知道，且这些事情芬无从问起。

科特看着芬，回忆起他是如何爱过芬的母亲。

芬长着他母亲的眼睛，但是眼神更显平和；嘴巴也随了母亲，但要苍白一些，稍显疲倦，似乎他试过千百次要说出那从未说出口的事情。芬随了他母亲那纤细的腰身，他比科特还要高，但身高对于他来讲更像是负担一般。他脸庞苍白，亦随了母亲，但头发却随了科特，甚至更加浓密乌黑。

“芬！”科特喊道，并把手搭在芬的肩膀上。

芬被这喊声吓了一跳，无法直视科特。但科特抓住了芬的下巴，让他抬起头。科特看着芬那双受惊的眼睛，脸上浮现出伤心的笑容，“还有一件事情没有告诉你，芬，阿德尔海德并没有情人。”

当看到儿子脸上突然显现的巨大喜悦，科特不由得也开怀笑了，他把芬拥入怀中，亲吻了他。

但突然间，科特离开了芬，在屋子里某处背对着他坐了下来。芬紧随其后，在科特身旁站了一会儿，心里对他充满深情和喜爱，却不知该说什么。

科特思绪万千。

他又重新经历了一遍，多年的沉默在他的意志里结成的疤又裂开了。他的眼神渐渐充满怒气，他想要像曾经那样说话，那时他还在为阿德尔海德做无谓的斗争。

然后，他看到了芬。

芬以他最喜欢的姿势坐在那里，头垂着，手掌摊开放在膝盖上。

于是科特内心又恢复平静，柔声说道：

“你当然高兴，因为她是你的母亲。”

科特穿过房间又走了回来，手搭在椅子后背上，瞧着沉浸于思考的芬。屋里如屋外一般沉寂，因为是周日的缘故。他们能听到晚间祷告的钟声响起。

“她从来没有得到过红色的花朵来取代那些她不喜欢的蓝色花朵。”科特说道，“我不知道，我经常想……”

祷告结束的钟声响起。

有一处钟声很近，有一处很远却更响。还有远处的钟声分不出彼此，在空中响成一片。

由于他们都在注意听，这钟声听起来比以往要响，巨大的喧闹盈满整个房间。

然后，房子大门处传来一阵隆隆的声音。马车驶进了软绵绵的雪地里，没了声响。“这是阿德尔海德要去教堂。”科特说道。

他坐在他儿子身边，开始低声说话，他并没有瞧着芬。

钟声突然停止，更加凸显了随之而来的寂静。

“有一个晚上在兰德克，钟声勾住了她，那是一个继充满阳光、欢乐和人群的白天之后的夜晚。她是所有人中最开心的那个，但傍晚时，她突然变得沉默疲惫，这样的状况据我所知经常毫无理由地发生……你和我们在一起。你那时十岁，你躺在那里睡着了。我们站在你的小床旁看着你，她突然开始哭泣，而我除了握住她的手不再说话外什么都做不了。”

芬听着科特讲话，就好像他听那钟声一般，不去管这些词语对他的意义是什么。他仅知道，他的母亲没犯任何错误，而他的父亲把一切都告诉了他，并让他最终决定他们之间的对和错。芬心中充满喜悦，这让其余一切都变得轻松且无关紧要起来。

科特继续说道：

“然后我拿着烟走到阳台上，她站在门廊处，听着小教堂的钟声回响在山间，我们白天刚参观过教堂回来，在那里，我们还听到了一个关于教堂的故事。曾经，一个虔诚的人为了赎罪修建了这座教堂，自那之后，教堂的钟声每天午夜后两小时都会响起……她问那钟声会不会就这样一直响到世界的尽头，然后我们开始谈论世界上的一切钟声，白天响的，夜里响的，日出响的，日落响的，还有抚慰疲惫的世人的。有时她会沉默。那钟声总会响起，她也总会重新开始讲话，而且经常是关于一件事情，关于世界上的钟是如何亘古不变地发着一致的声音。还有那些第一次听到钟声的人，他们像狂野的异教徒一般在无尽的树林里跑着。关于那些在现代社会里意志突然崩塌的人，他们跪了下来，爬着离开钟声召唤他们的地方。”

芬抬起头。科特的话终于引起了他的注意，把他从梦里拽了回来。

“我仍旧能回想起她站在夜色下，把自己灵魂交给上帝的样子。她那奇异的眼睛望着星空，她那苍白的脸，她的双手，还有她的话语，来得如此快，就好像她的生命全都依赖于她的话语，如此沉重，就好像每一个词语都给她带来痛苦。她根本没有考虑到我在那里：她讲话的样子就好像她在教堂里做忏悔，然后她就宣布结束了。她周围的一切都变得空洞、冷漠、黑暗，四处都是痛苦和绝望，在那里她笑意盈盈的眼睛曾见证过节日的灯光和人群。绝望绵延不绝，她不得不闭上眼睛以抵制绝望的侵袭。绝望越来越近，越来越强，她逃命一样地逃开。现在，绝望就在那里，充满天地，在她身体里，在她周围，远远近近。如果那钟声无法抗击绝望，那她就得死。”

科特声音如此轻柔，芬几乎听不到他的声音。

“然后，那钟声停止了。不久，天亮了，阳光照耀在她那雪白湿润的脸颊上。她一动不动，保持沉默，但她的思绪依旧。当我们周围的事物开始动起来时，她离开了旅店，我不知道她去了哪里，但我敢打赌她去了教堂。夜晚的时候，她才回来。午夜，我们又一次坐在阳台上，继续听教堂的钟声。就这样，一周过去了。我经常会担心她失去理智。她总是讲述同样的事情，她沉默的时候则更糟糕。我让老汉斯带着你先回了家，第二天我们也离开了那里，但我们并没有回家。她想把我们旅行的路线再走一遍。她说她想去她寻欢路上曾路过的每一个教堂里祈祷。”

芬在他的椅子里直起身来，“那你去了吗？”

“我做了她所希望的。旅途最后变成了去往每一个生活无拘无束的地方的朝圣。我们不断地从一个地方赶往另一个地方。她不肯错过任何一个教堂，唯恐有罪名她没有祈祷到，唯恐将来那钟声无法抵达她的坟墓。”

“那之后你们回家了吗？”

科特看着他的儿子，好像他早已忘记他还待在这屋子里。他突然意识到那些日子和当下生活的不同，他的神情变得忧郁不堪，他的眼神严肃起来，让芬觉得害怕。

“之后，我们回到家里。再之后……”

科特迅速站起，双臂交叉在胸前，看着芬，“之后我们回到家里。随着时间推移，阿德尔海德也慢慢地恢复了精神上的平静。她又找到了昔日的自己。她的思绪变幻莫测，她的欲望永远也无法满足。现在她的马车还像从前那样经常在大街上走动，只不过马车会停在教堂门口，而不是剧院。”

芬想说话，但又说不出口，因为科特就站在他面前，眼睛盯着芬看，还朝他点了一次头，就好像在说他知道芬想要说什么，而且他所说的毫无意义。

“她去参加上帝的欢宴了，”科特说，“而且上帝也会参加她的聚会。”

芬坐回到椅子里。

他既不为他父亲所说的感到伤心，也不为他的母亲苦恼，如果这一切都是真的，这让他既惊讶又羞愧。他知道他应该有抗拒之心或者怜悯之情，但却没有，因为他对这一切太了解了。

科特大步跨过屋子，“天堂不是阿德尔海德想要的，也不是她寻找的。你可能得需要再过几年才能理解我的话。但是，芬，这一生，我所看到的上帝在那些否定他的人身上最能显现。在他们的责任感里，他们的人性里，在他们的骄傲中，我看到了上帝的光芒。其他人，那些不断向他忏悔，把他摆满屋子的人，当他们应该歌颂他的伟大荣耀时，他们却让我更无法看清上帝，他们赞美他的全能，实则使他变得很渺小。”

科特讲了好一阵子。芬无聊且无助地坐在椅子里，希望他父亲能停下来。他感觉自己好像不小心见证了他不该看的事，又好像得到了不该有的信任。

在芬的内心深处，对他父亲滔滔不绝所说的话不屑一顾。

但此刻，科特就坐在他面前，紧握芬的手，眼神温柔忧郁，话语温柔谦卑，好像一个罪人那样祈求内心的平静，“我不知道，芬。我无法解释这一切给你听。我无法跟你讨论这些事情。父亲是可怜的生物，芬，我是个可怜的父亲。我无法告诉你森林是绿色的，鸟儿会歌唱，这蓝色的天空后面一无所有。我不敢，芬。我认为我没有这样的权利。我也无法跟你一起去教堂，甚至当你和你母亲一起去教堂时我也无法开心。”

科特紧张地摁了摁芬的手。芬的手一动不动，他亦不知道该如何回应他父亲的眼神。

“但是，我必须要告诉你一点，就这一次，今天，我向你坦白，以弥补我们作为父母的责任。如果你愿意试着理解我，宽恕我，宽恕我们，因为我们没有我们的孩子所期望的那样富有，因为我们有一个孩子。你爱这钟声，芬。当钟声一响起，你就会进入梦乡，这钟声送你去遥远的地方。自你是小孩子时起就是这样。我非常能理解，我也很爱听这钟声。我很高兴，因为有这钟声在那儿。但是，芬，芬，除了这些召唤我们去教堂的钟声外，世界上还有很多其他的钟声。每个人都有只属于他自己的钟声，只有他自己能听到，只会召唤他本人。有些富有、帅气的人，不论他们走到哪里，钟声都会为他们响起。他们过着比我们更有权势、更得意的生活。他们让我们……我们之中那些爱他们的人遭受痛苦。但世界上没有人渺小到不会有钟声召唤他。钟声存在于一个人的工作中，在他的孩子身上，在他的爱情里。对有的人来说，他的钟声在他母亲居住的干净的小屋子里，可能他只有在星期天的时候在那里待一个小时……每个人的情形都不一样，芬，但钟声一直都在。当人们走上了不该走的路，钟声就会把他们叫回来，如果来不及，钟声会敦促他们忏悔。不论举办宴会的时候，还是疲倦伤心的时候，他都会有钟声相伴。但教堂的钟声，它们只为那些耳朵被生活震聋的人发出。生活会发出可怕的噪音。那些钟声在周日响起，就是为了提醒我们过去一周所忘记的，有它们在那儿可真好。但是，芬，当教堂的钟声把那些曾经都有属于自己的神圣之地的人逼到一起，这是多么悲伤啊。那就好像当一个家庭破碎后，家里的老人不得不在济贫院找到一处避难所。阳光穿过窗户，室内温暖，窗扉上的花朵鲜艳。芬，你母亲和我之间，我们有过更好的时候，我们的那个钟声，曾经也在老屋子里响起。”

科特沉默，不再看芬。芬也放松下来，最终找到他想要说的话，“我能使用那个房间吗，父亲？我能把它重新布置一下吗，跟原来一样，然后跟我的书一起搬进那里？”

科特松开了他儿子的手，他脸上的神情让芬后悔说出那样的请求。此刻，两人都站了起来，科特脸上浮现出一丝微笑说：

“可以。亲爱的孩子，你从未要求过任何事情。这屋子就当作我送给你的礼物吧。”

那一天，科特的儿子刚刚过完他的二十一岁生日。





第十三章


芬站在老屋子里，手里拿着泛黄的文件，上面写道：

上帝把我带到这里，让我能盖起这座漂亮的房子，它将长久屹立，见证我和我家族的力量。在这里，他们将正直地生活，慷慨地给予。这房子会被一代一代的父子忠诚守护。善良的男人女人会坐在那大厅里，伴着笛声和提琴起舞。

我将这屋子设置在整个房子最秘密的部位，除了房子的设计师和我最老的仆人外，没有人知道它的存在。我给了房子的设计师一笔封口费，让他发誓不会把这秘密泄露出去。而我的老仆人则对我无比忠诚。

我不仅给屋子镀了金，还配备了有图饰的皮帘子和昂贵的东方地毯。我有两把从米兰定制的精致的扶手椅，木质部分那里被雕刻了鸟和动物的图案，黑暗中，它们好像露出奇怪的笑容，但打开灯的时候笑容就消失了。

我给了仆人一把房间钥匙，告诉他要诚心诚意地照料房间。每天傍晚，暮色渐浓时，他就会点燃壁炉架上的蜡烛，即便他知道他的主人正在远方旅行，他也照做不误。每个早晨，他会亲自收拾房间。除了他自己，没有其他仆人曾进入这个屋子。

因为这个屋子是为我和我的妻子准备的。因此我把这屋子设置在房子最为隐秘的地方，远离我们工作的账房，远离仆人们走来走去的走廊，远离我们会见客人的客厅，甚至远离我们的婚房。

这将是我们婚姻的神殿，因为我们的爱情使之神圣，而这爱情比我们所知的任何一切都要伟大。在这儿，我们会向上帝祈祷，是他把我们带给彼此。在这儿，每个我们心灵相交的晚上，我们会开心真诚地交谈。当我们死去后，我们的儿子将带着他的妻子来到这里，继续做我们做过的事情。

今晚，是我在这所新房子里度过的第一个晚上，我带着我的妻子来到这里，告诉了她我的心愿。她充满爱意地倾听了我的想法，我在这里记录下事情的经过，并签上我们的名字，让后人见证。

芬读着他们的名字，还有后来房子主人和他们妻子的名字。最后，科特和阿德尔海德的名字浮现在眼前，但又被划去了。

然后，芬把这份文件放回了原处，环顾四周。

老屋子又恢复了以前的样子，高高耸立在广场上，深幽而寂静，好似一个没有生命存在的地方。

阳台被雪覆盖，麻雀在雪里跳来跳去。屋子里，在那彩色的窗格后面，是红色的花朵，极度渴望阳光。皮革挂帘上的灰尘已被扫去，重新恢复了以往的亮度。东方地毯在地上铺展开来，好似流放归来的贵族重新掌管了他的家园。

所有以前的老家伙事儿都又一次找回了各自的位置，合法安心地站在那里，就好像一切从未改变过。钢琴、画着在荆棘中扭动的男人的罐子、星星不仅发光还会移动的天球仪，所有这些由不同的主人带来的家具都又一次出现在屋子里。

在壁炉前面摆着两把硕大奇特的扶手椅。

芬觉得他好像在天主教堂里，每一面飞舞的旗帜都是一位名人的墓志铭。他吸吮着过去时光的味道，他想象出来满屋子的男男女女坐在那里，或强硬或温柔地交谈，他们周围的一切已经进入梦乡。

芬陷入了对那对最后在这屋子里坐着的夫妇的沉思，这两人给予他生命，但他却不知应该做什么。

他看到他们年轻时的爱和挣扎。他听到他们的声音，他看到阿德尔海德的红唇和科特那沉稳的眼神。他看到科特带着自己的妻子来到这里，这里是房子的灵魂、传统和密室，向她展示他祖先留在这里的稀奇古怪的物件。

他看到那天科特独自站在壁炉旁，在空荡荡的房间里，将他和阿德尔海德的名字从那份文件上划掉，然后门也不关地离去。

他看到所发生的一切。但他们并不是他的父亲和母亲。他们是两个他从书本上读来的、并逐渐喜欢上的惹人喜爱的人，他对他们的喜爱就如同对艺术的喜爱一样，是苍白的，没有任何探寻的欲望。

芬将其中一把大椅子拉到窗户边上，长久地坐在那里。

当他坐在那里时，阿德尔海德走了过来。

她站在门廊处，穿着白色的裙袍，满头银发的她向他点头。然后，阿德尔海德转头看了看屋子四周。

然后，一切就好像梦的影子一样发生又随即消失：屋子里的一切都恢复了生机。

钢琴开始歌唱，古董椅子上的怪脸伸出了长脖子，屋内的每个角落都有低语声。

阿德尔海德缩了回去。她没有看到芬，忘记了他还在那里。

但是芬看到了她。

他从椅子上站起来，他的眼睛泛着光芒，“你点亮了这屋子，母亲，这屋子也点亮了你。”

芬握起阿德尔海德的手亲吻了一下，阿德尔海德被芬牵着，走进了这个容不下她年轻欲望的屋子。

童话故事结束了，连同对这屋子的恐惧一起。但那光芒仍旧在阿德尔海德身上显现，她看上去美极了。她的脸如同小姑娘那般粉嫩，她的步伐轻盈，她的眼睛湿润而羞涩。她轻轻地、开心地笑着，一边观看这些老家具，一边讲关于它们的故事，不时抚摸着它们。

她讲了那个每当悲伤时便唱歌的女人的故事，是她带来了这架老钢琴。当她在钢琴上弹出和声时，她的手都在发颤，那轻柔美妙的旋律响彻房间。她还讲了老纺车的故事，这老纺车曾夜夜不停地呼啦呼啦地转了一整年。她还讲到了天球仪，那曾是那个智力衰退的人的玩具。还有那带着一张空洞的脸的布娃娃，让人想起那个害怕这屋子的寂静而从来不敢踏入这里的女主人。但她的儿子，因为非常爱她，把布娃娃藏在了窗帘后面。还有莱克，她的画像曾挂在墙上露出污渍的地方，但是后来被取下来了，因为她的婚姻解体了。

还有那个画着在荆棘里扭动的男人的坛罐，这是她带给这房间的礼物。阿德尔海德轻轻拂过这坛罐，沉默不语。

芬的眼睛紧追着阿德尔海德。

他从未看过他的母亲如此美丽。他不认识那样的眼神，那样的笑容，那样清澈的声音。

有时，芬会在她讲的基础上加一点儿东西，他说话内涵丰富，让她感到惊讶和害怕。现在，他可以在阿德尔海德说话前就猜到她要说的事情。然后，她从未怀疑过他会知道这些事情。

阿德尔海德内心的恐惧与日俱增，因为不晓得科特对他都说了什么。

但芬已沉浸在自己的欢乐中。

陶醉于阿德尔海德的美丽，痴迷于屋子里这些奇怪的东西，还有那深深的寂静中，他想让这游戏进行得更加生动，却忘记了老屋子的封印已被打破。

芬将另一把椅子也拉到窗户那里，让阿德尔海德坐下，然后他自己坐到另外一把椅子里，说道：

“现在，你不是我的母亲，你是我年轻的新娘。我带你来到这个神圣的地方，我现在要告诉你它的秘密。”

听到芬的话，阿德尔海德突然脸色苍白，芬内疚地握起她的手，说：

“我伤害到你了吗，母亲？”

阿德尔海德摇摇头，强挤出一点儿笑容。

然后芬再次走进屋子里，开心地拥抱这屋子的一切，但阿德尔海德依旧坐在那里，眉头紧锁。

她心情沉重，因为在她看来，当他们坐在这房子的密室里聊天时，她突然就不是他的母亲了。旧时光强有力地冲击着她的大脑，把她带到另外一个世界里去了。

老房子充满了回音，科特的言语，科特的爱……那坚定的信念，还有这在优良的传统之下发芽且在过往时日里不断壮大的家族的巨大幸福，都融为一体。

有那么一刻，阿德尔海德在想，如果一切按照科特所想的那样发生应该会很好。

但同时，又有一个想法抓住了她，让她变得叛逆而年轻，就如同很多年前她最后一次站在这屋子里一样。

她狠狠地将自己的椅子向后推了推，环视着充满敌意的屋子，眼里满含泪水。

阿德尔海德看向芬，他站在天球仪旁，试图将其启动，但却因为开关生锈而卡住了。

阿德尔海德想，当芬到了娶妻的年纪，他会想要恢复传统，将他的妻子也带到这里，和她坐在这对古董椅子里吗？

之后是芬的儿子，以及儿子的儿子，他们都会读到那泛黄文件上被划掉的她的名字。她会像其他那些在这个家族里被标上标签的人一样，关于她爱出去玩和猎寻根本不存在的快乐的流言蜚语会越来越多。

“来帮帮我，母亲。”芬说道。

阿德尔海德走了过去，用力地按下了开关，天球仪又开始转动起来。

“瞧，你泄露了魔法的秘密。”芬说道。

他自顾自地说着话，看到天球仪能发亮、能转动的星星非常高兴。

“芬，来我身边坐。”

等芬坐了过来，阿德尔海德又顿了一会儿，就好像她在找她想要说的话，而且，她说话时并没有看着芬。

“芬，”阿德尔海德把手放在他肩头，然后又立刻抽开，“芬，有一次，很多年以前，有一天晚上，我独自待在老屋子里。你知道，我以前经常会和你的父亲来这里，我被老屋子的权威控制，从来没有在这里真正开心过。我当时还很年轻，芬，这一切和我的憧憬和快乐都格格不入。我当时无法理解这些，也无法减轻或者克服这屋子带给我的不适感。因为你的父亲是属于这屋子的，而这屋子还有屋里的古怪东西都是属于他的，而且它们都在抗拒着我。每次我来到门前，我的心脏都停止跳动。而一旦我在这里面，就好像……就好像我不能再诉说我的想法，而是说着别人安排好的话。哦，都是些好话，但不是我的。但当我鼓起勇气，说出我自己想说的，我的话听起来又好像我在诋毁老屋子还有你父亲以及上帝。之后……”

阿德尔海德感到，她正在背叛放在她手上的一些伟大而美好的事物。她看看周围，似乎在害怕屋子里还有其他人，或者整个屋子会跳起来用它根深蒂固的力量反对她。

但屋里没有其他人，也没有声音。

然后，她转头看着芬，高兴地说道：

“但是那一晚，芬，我解除了老屋子的咒语。我把神龛上的那块薄纱扯了下来，薄纱后面什么都没有。第一次，我感到我可以在我的家里自由呼吸。”

阿德尔海德并没有说明后来她如何又被恐惧笼罩，继而狼狈地逃离了这屋子。但是，她没有达到她撒谎想要达到的目的。芬悲伤地看着她，说道：

“你怎么能那么做，母亲？你怎么能那么想它？”

“你也受了咒语的控制吗？”阿德尔海德问道。

她的语气中透露出嘲笑的意味，比她预期的要浓烈许多，这让她惊吓不已。但芬并没有注意到。

“那老屋子已经不存在了，仅仅是一个意象，一个纪念碑，是我依据父亲所说编造的幻象。”芬说。

阿德尔海德扭过头去，继续听着。

“但若我也经历过老屋子还存在的那段时光，它肯定也会控制住我。”

“是的，你一直都在跟你父亲谈话。”阿德尔海德轻轻地说。

“是的。”

然后，芬在阿德尔海德面前躺了下来，如以往那般将脸放在她的手里。

“是的，”芬重复道，“还有，母亲，我爱你。你如此美丽。但我们再也不会讨论那老屋子了……因为我认为那老屋子是我所知道的最精彩、最美丽、最强大的事物。可是，一想到我没有完全随了你，或继承了父亲的所有，我无法专一地分享你们俩任何一人最强烈的感情，我就会心痛。我无法跟父亲讨论这一点，也没法跟你讨论，对吗？”

阿德尔海德没有回答他，而是温柔地抚摸着他的头发。两人都没有再说话，屋子里静极了。

沉默中，阿德尔海德又做回了自己。许多已定型的时光回到了本来的状态，钟声单调又激烈地响着，从外界曾淹没它们的噪音中脱离出来。

她惊叹老屋子在她心里所引起的兴奋。熄灭的，是让她成为老屋子女主人的爱，同时也是让屋子无法承载的赤红欲望。她想到科特，想到科特曾为在她看来不值得拼搏的事情而拼搏。她哀伤地看着她高挑沉静的儿子，他那疲倦的思绪和她如出一辙。

阿德尔海德双手叠放在膝盖处，她眼神里的光芒退去，老屋子的光辉也从她脸上消失，她的话语变得如同她的思绪一般平静。

芬看着她，但是却没有看到这些变化。而对于芬而言，这童话故事也已经结束。他低着头坐在古董椅子里，手在膝盖处摊开。

无意识地，两人又恢复到日常的交流方式，没有思想上的交汇，更算不上是观点的碰撞。他们说着几乎同样的事情，不论其中一个人的思绪如何漂游，另外一个总是能找得到。他们的话语总是很郑重，却并没有威胁感。很多次，他们坐在那里，虽然什么都没说，却以为已经跟对方说了一切。

“看，”芬指向窗外，“多可怕！”

一架灵车正穿过广场。

芬一边挪动自己的椅子，一边说：

“灵车应该用步行的速度行驶，庄重地，有仪式感地，就好像他们只是要赶马去饮水一样。战士应该保持身姿笔挺，走路的步伐、节拍都一致，即便他们鞋子该去修鞋匠那儿修了也要保持一致。这样的话，一切就简单了。”

芬安静了一阵。然后他转过头，看着阿德尔海德，“那天我在跟父亲聊天，我正好说了类似的话。”

阿德尔海德惊讶地看着芬。

“我不知道为什么突然讲起了这个。但父亲大笑，说我应该写一篇关于这事儿的文章或者组织一个社团，专门维持正确的灵车速度。”

阿德尔海德微笑，低头看着放在腿上的双手。

“然后，他突然变得严肃，走到我身边，手搭在我肩膀，说：‘灵车应该被开得再快些，用眨眼的工夫将死人带走，让生命成长开花！’”

“父亲是权威。”阿德尔海德说。

芬点点头。

然后他们开始讨论科特。他们总是这样做。他们总是急于寻找漂亮的词汇来赞美他。但内心里，他们都知道，科特比起他俩，显得更粗糙一些。

他们从来不这么讲，但他们都可怜科特，那感觉就好像看着一个明明静静坐着就可以，却偏要不断奔跑的人一样。

但是，当他们一起交谈时，阿德尔海德知道，在芬的灵魂深处，他崇拜也害怕父亲那威严的一面。

虽然这种感情如此弱小，不过只是一个苍白的映象，映出她年少时的爱情，一个遥远的回音，回响着当科特追求她时，她心中为科特辩护的声音。

但这足以让她受伤。她想，她仅仅短暂地拥有过她儿子。她在他给予她的亲密中察觉到一丝不屑。她想，在芬身上，有一些比芬所给予她的更加强大的东西，这些东西来自科特或将要变成如此。

而且，阿德尔海德意识到，争夺芬的斗争将要比重新打开老屋子还要艰难。

一整天，芬都专注于他脑子里的那些事情。现在，他在想象他母亲打破屋子咒语的那一晚。

“我就是不能理解，你怎么忍心。”他说道。

阿德尔海德立刻知道他的意思，但是什么都没有说。

“应该有一些法则，就好像童话故事里的，那个掀起面纱的人就必须死掉，”芬说，“而且，应该有一层又一层的面纱，面纱叠面纱，母亲，你能忍受直视太阳吗？女人应该戴着面纱且从不……从不掀起它，除非是非常重大的场合，大到一切都变得伟大，而且人不应该去看那玩耍的人群。”

阿德尔海德在她的椅子里直起了上半身。

她想告诉芬，在那个晚上，因为她的鲁莽，她遭受了人生最强烈的恐惧。但是她说不出口。一会儿后，她望向广场，极其平静地说道：

“假设有人无法戴上面纱，假设那纱会让人窒息。”

此刻，芬也望向远处，说道：

“纱叠着纱，纱盖着死人。”

阿德尔海德叹了口气，什么都没有说。

“那样，人就可以生活了。”芬说。





第十四章


从那天起，芬只在迫不得已时离开那间屋子。

春天融化了屋子前的喷泉，芬欣喜于那无休无止的潺潺水声。红色的花朵也被放到了阳台上：当风吹过，花瓣会被正好吹到楼下的喷泉里，漂在水面上。他看着花瓣从空中飞舞而下，猜测它们能否到达目的地。

傍晚，当广场上千灯齐亮，这是芬一天中最美好的时光。

他喜欢那即将消逝的白昼。

他知晓每盏熄灭的灯光，熟悉每个停止的声音。而他最中意的便是那刚刚戛然而止的声音和骤然熄灭的灯光。在他心里，披着夜色游荡的人们是另外一类人，好过于那些走在太阳底下的人。他跟这些人都不认识，没有任何关系，但他莫名地更喜欢那些夜行的人。

当夜晚来临，喷泉划破夜空的沉寂，大声地歌唱，远处传来哭喊声，没有人知道这哭声来自哪里，孤独的脚步由远及近，又由近及远，然后芬会点燃壁炉架上的蜡烛，在其中一个老椅子上坐下，在那儿，曾坐着房子的主人和他们的妻子，整栋房子入睡后，他们会坐在那里聊天。

芬环视屋子，屋里的一切都在黑暗的角落里歌唱，他不敢相信自己以前竟然不知道老屋子的存在。

比起任何其他地方，老屋子更让芬觉得无拘无束：在这里，他可以躲开外面令他烦心的世界，因为那个世界需要他展现他所没有的品质。在这里，每一个点、每一件物品都在诉说以往的事情，芬好奇地听着，为老屋子那不可思议的美丽感到欣慰。

有时，芬会陷入梦境，并一直静静地坐着，直到灯都熄灭了。

“他睡眠不够。”阿德尔海德担心地说。

科特心里也在想着一样的问题，他穿过房间，停在了阿德尔海德坐着的地方，说：

“我在想，他有没有醒过，阿德尔海德？”

白天，芬会坐在窗户旁向外望去，无所事事，双手摊放在膝盖上。

当科特穿越广场，他总是认为，他能看到在窗格后面的芬。科特会停下来，冲他点点头。

但芬从未看到过科特。因为他从不积极主动地观察任何事物。

科特进进出出房子，总是期望老屋子强壮的气息能够晕染他儿子的脸色，唤醒他的意志，科特总是相信，这一切迟早都会发生。

自从科特和老仆人把老屋子整理如初后，他便再也没有去过那里。

对此，芬非常开心。他非常担心科特会来这屋子瞧瞧他，以至于每当听到有脚步声靠近，他都需要极力克制自己的恐惧。当芬从恐惧中恢复平静，他意识到，科特来这屋子里是迟早要发生的事情，而那一天将是不愉悦的一天。

其实芬很清楚科特眼中一直都有的充满爱意的疑问，这问题让他担惊受怕。他害怕科特对他的渴望，这种渴望比一个父亲应有的热切得多，更像是一国之主对即将继承王位的继承人的期盼。

而芬那无力的双手根本无法掌控一个国家，也承受不住头顶皇冠的压力，仅仅是有这样的想法都已让他头痛不已。

但阿德尔海德经常来老屋子，他们两人会惬意地坐在那里。

阿德尔海德对芬没有什么期盼。而且，虽然她多疑不安，自芬搬到老屋子后她就总是这样，但当屋子的门在她身后关上，她就会安静下来。

安静得像芬，像硕大的古董椅子和画着在荆棘中扭动的男人的罐子，像那辆曾经好多年夜夜发出欢快的呼呼声、纺线仍旧穿在纺锤上的纺车一般安静。

当阿德尔海德说话时，芬会看着她微笑点头。芬自己也会讲话，长久地，然后突然停止，不过这不会有什么影响，然后他会听那喷泉的汩汩声，老屋子里的声音，这些声音总是在对他讲话，而当阿德尔海德和他在一起时，讲的话最通俗易懂。

芬告诉阿德尔海德，当她来到这里，这屋子就不再是他一人的了。

他觉得自己像个陌生人，来自另外一个年代，他会突然发现自己住在一个充满各种危险和冒险的废墟城堡里，和最后一个享受过城堡里富足生活的人面对面站着。

有一次，在阿德尔海德进入屋子的那一刻，他大声地喊出了她的名字。那时，房间里极暗，他的声音和身形像极了科特，这让阿德尔海德脸色苍白，惊恐不已。但芬没有注意到这一切，阿德尔海德逼自己笑了笑，很快就忘记了这件事。

逐渐地，当他们两个都在老屋子的时候，那奇妙的肃穆消散在背景里，他们在那里度过越来越多的时间，到最后变成，只有在老屋子里时，两人才算陪伴彼此。

他们过去会一起读书，而且是用这种特定的方式读书，他们中的某个人会发现一本书，一个安静又满是歌声的宝藏，这是他们觉得唯一可以与之相比的，然后读完这本书的人再给对方，而对方则会于他们在一起的时候来读这本书。

大部分书都是外语书，书多得好像无穷尽。正是因为用外语书写，书变得更为珍贵，因为异国语言能把他们带到更远的地方去。

当他们读完一本书，他们会沉浸在书中。并不是沉浸在它的情节或它的角色里，而是在它的音乐里。他们把书中的思想和话语转化为音符。

那时，他们好似体验了一些经历，或者好像他们在旅行。

“艺术家会名留青史，”芬说，“他把天空描绘成蓝灰色，为了他自己……为了他自己也为了我们所有人。他用手擦掉所有东西，然后又重新建立，建立更大的，至今为止最大的事物。他是主宰者。他是上帝。”

一天，芬要求阿德尔海德唱首歌。

阿德尔海德许多年都未曾唱过歌了，除非在教堂里，因而当芬提出这个要求时，阿德尔海德很诧异。

“我已放弃唱歌了，芬。”

芬在她面前躺下，看着她的脸朝她微笑，“我清楚地记得你唱歌的时候。当我还是小男孩时你总是唱歌给我听。但是有一次，有一次我记得很清楚，家里有很多客人，我早已上床，但我并没有睡着。因为老玛丽答应我当客人们用晚餐，你要唱歌的时候，会带我到宴会厅里。她告诉我，当有客人时，所有的灯都被点亮，你是最漂亮、最光彩照人的，那时，你会唱得比以往好听一千倍。”

阿德尔海德把视线从芬的脸上移开，躺回椅子里。

“我一直醒着，直到老玛丽来了，我等了好久，但我听到了你歌唱，还从门缝里看到了你。”

“有那么好吗？”

“我不记得了。但我记得有很多张脸。如果再见到他们我应该能认得出来，幸运的是，我记得父亲的脸。”

阿德尔海德站起来。

“我应该唱什么呢？”她问道。

芬满意地笑了，走到钢琴前，打开钢琴，然后他选了一首曲子。

“看我找到了什么，”他说，“这是那个把钢琴放在这里的人所唱的歌曲。瞧，这里是她的名字，她自己写了词和曲。瞧这笔迹可真模糊，但同时又这么明显。”

阿德尔海德站在那里，手里拿着那泛黄的曲单。她哼着小调，敲打着琴键。

然后她坐在钢琴前，边弹边唱了起来：

白天正在消逝，亲爱的少女：

你知道吗，夜晚来临；

警示的风，满载香气，

带来凉气寒灯。

我们必须分开：时间促使这样！

白天正在消逝，黄昏正在到来。

听！你母亲正在喊你：

亲爱的少女，我必须离去。



我们必须分离，亲爱的少女，悲伤漫溢！

白天一定会消逝。

唉，但到明日，

我们错失了数不清的快乐，

少说了数不清的话语。

我们从浪费的机会中抢走时间，

眼睛充满彼此的影子，

数不清的亲吻被我们忘记。



快乐的微笑萦绕着做梦的你，

在纯洁的白色躺椅上；

我脑海中你的身影摇曳，

我将要快快过完夜晚。

让绯红的太阳起程！

你的脸上明亮的阳光，

回忆中故地的阳光，

爱情的阳光在你的心里。

唱完后，她在钢琴前坐了一会儿，手里拿着曲单。芬问道：“那女人曾唱过这歌。你觉得她快乐吗，母亲？”

“她经常伤心，”阿德尔海德说，“每当她伤心时，她就会唱歌。”

阿德尔海德放下曲单，拿起手边的一本乐谱，但又立刻扔在了一边，好像乐谱烫到了她的手指。

乐谱上是丽诺尔系列，她曾经给科特唱过。

阿德尔海德站了起来，坐回到芬旁边。然后她又突然站起来，双臂交叉在胸前，又坐下，大眼睛盯着窗外，“芬，如果我唱歌给你听，你还能辨别出老玛丽带你下楼听我唱歌时的那曲子吗？”

芬回过神来，惊讶地看着阿德尔海德，“那首歌，不，我应该不能。为什么这么问？你记得那首歌吗？”

“不。”阿德尔海德回答道。

他们长久沉默地坐着。黄昏来临，屋子里变暗了。

“母亲，”芬问道，“女人是什么样的？”

阿德尔海德慢慢地扭头看着芬。而芬并没有看着她。他的眼睛看着远处，阿德尔海德意识到，他已经忘记他刚刚问的问题，或者，他根本没有意识到自己问了那样的问题。





第十五章


阿德尔海德裹着披肩站在窗户旁望向外面。马在下面的门廊处跺着脚，车夫站在马车门旁边等候着。

他们准备去车站接芬。

整个夏天，芬都在国外。

这是芬第一次独自离家，他并不喜欢独自在外的日子。从佛罗伦萨，西班牙，到巴黎，他一直都在写信问可不可以回家。但科特决意芬应该在国外待够原定的时间。

芬经常写信给阿德尔海德，语气尴尬无比，因为他知道父亲会首先读到这些信。科特注意到了这一点，但什么都没说。他快速浏览信件，似乎想要找到一些积极向上的东西，但当他放下信件时，脸上总是露出一副失望的表情。

科特会把他收到的信递给阿德尔海德，虽然阿德尔海德从未要求过。




阿德尔海德急躁地看了看自己的手表，然后坐了下来，闭上眼睛，头抵着窗格。

她心里想，整个夏天家里是多么空虚无聊。

关于老屋子，科特没有说过一言半语，但从芬搬到老屋子那一刻起，他俩之间的关系发生了改变。一些不确定的、无法言说的事情发生了，但这些事情也是注定要发生的。

当芬在国外时，这些微妙之处在他们之间不断扩大……而两人也没有做任何事情加以阻止或助长。两人都过着各自的生活，在各自对芬的期盼中渐行渐远。白天对于他们来讲显得尤为漫长，他们的房间非常冰冷。

然而，阿德尔海德内心里对科特的焦虑与日俱增，科特变得更加沉默，眼神中充满忧伤。

门开了，她猛站起来，“我们要迟到了，科特。”

“完全不会，”科特平静地说，“你叫的马车来得太早了。”

“我们走吧，科特。可以去了那里等。”

科特坐下来，帽子放在膝盖上，看着阿德尔海德。阿德尔海德低头站在那里，扣着手套的纽扣。

“坐下等一会儿。”科特说道，推了推旁边的椅子，示意阿德尔海德坐下。

“你想跟我聊天？”

“坐下，阿德尔海德，”科特不耐烦地讲道，“等一会儿。”

阿德尔海德倚着椅子仍旧站着。

“我们很久都没有聊天了，阿德尔海德，很多很多年了。你知道吗？”

阿德尔海德耸了耸肩。

“是的，”她说道，声音坚定无比，“但我们现在能平静相处。”

科特点点头，指头不断地拍打帽子，看向窗外，“是的，是的，毫无疑问。我们老了，阿德尔海德。老得不行了。”

“这就是你想对我说的吗？”

“我担心芬，”科特说，“他回家时跟当初他离开时不会有什么变化，一样地脸色苍白，一个可怜的上帝缔造的幻想家。明天，他又会坐在那里，看着外面的生活而自己却不敢参与其中。”

“是的，他为什么会去老屋子里？”

“是他问的我，”科特平静地说，“我不能拒绝本来就属于他的遗产。他有权力了解他出生的地方。”

“那然后呢？你觉得你能够追回已流逝的时光吗？”

“不，”科特说，“我不那么认为。我也不想那样做。”

科特沉默了一会儿。阿德尔海德没有把眼神从科特身上挪开。然后科特说道：

“如果他喜欢，芬可以给自己盖一座新房子。或者，他可以重新装饰他老祖宗的房子，装上平板玻璃窗和宽大的楼梯，以及任何适合他，还有他的时代的东西。但他得知道，墙壁很坚固，塔楼很高耸，他得为此而感恩。”

阿德尔海德把她靠着的椅子往后推了推，说道：

“在你的安排里，似乎没有给母亲留下任何空间。”

她的声音颤抖不已，怒目圆睁。科特站了起来，像以往一样平静地说道：

“是你离开了，阿德尔海德。你不希望在那里生活。”

阿德尔海德没有回答。她知道，科特并没有要问她意见的意思，也未曾想要她帮忙。

“阿德尔海德，现在，芬快回来了。”

“然后呢？”

“我很担心他，阿德尔海德。我请你自己注意自己的言行，不要给他带来伤害。我觉得有的时候，你扑灭了他原本就可怜的精神气。你所得到的平静，可能这本身是件好事，对你的作用也不错，但他还年轻，你得记住这一点。他才刚刚开始他的人生，他不需要平静或顺从。对你是恩赐的事物对他可能意味着死亡。”

阿德尔海德向科特走了一步，抬起头说道：

“已经到了这样的地步，科特，为了芬，你把我当作敌人。”

“可能确实会这样。”科特说。

“你会把我逼成这样，科特。”

科特抓起阿德尔海德的手，紧紧地抓着不让她抽走。

“不，不，阿德尔海德。我仅仅是想警告你。”





第十六章


阳台门大敞着，他们之前忘记了关门。但天气温和，几乎没有什么风。不时地，会有一片黄叶飘落在栏杆附近。天色渐暗。

阿德尔海德手托着头望向外面。

科特的话一直在她耳边回响。她觉得芬和以前不一样了。他变得焦躁不安，无法静静地坐着，甚至絮絮叨叨。

“不论我去哪里，我都能感觉到外面的喷泉，”芬说，“它每时每刻都跟着我。没什么比喷泉的潺潺水声更响亮了，它让夜晚显得如此静谧，那潺潺水声在我耳边歌唱乡愁，又陪伴我回到了老屋子……我在想，是不是哪一位房子的主人建造了这个喷泉？”

“我不这么想。”

“是的，”芬说，“一定是这样的。我非常确定。可能是房子的建造者。你瞧，它是老屋子的组成部分，它是老屋子的象征。如果这里只剩下喷泉，其他一切也会依旧保持一样。我必须去问问父亲。”

阿德尔海德打了个寒战，芬关上了门。

“我们都不喜寒冷。我们俩都是。我们不像父亲那样。昨晚我去他卧室说晚安的时候我想关上窗户，他却嘲笑了我。‘不要，芬，秋天的空气凛冽健康，让人变得年轻，坐在风口那儿，别担心，你是大人了！’父亲这么说。”芬说。

“是的，你父亲很强壮。”

芬偷偷地看了一眼阿德尔海德。

他立刻明白，在他出国期间，他的父母已经渐渐疏远，而他却是这个结果的承受者。他如同以往那般挚爱他的母亲，但不论他们在讨论什么，他总是会想到科特。

“父亲很伤心。”芬说。

“我没有注意到这一点。”

阿德尔海德说完这句后变了脸色。但芬此刻没有看着她，几乎没有听到她的回答。

“很奇怪，母亲，在外面，在我的旅途中，很多次我有一种感觉：我会遇到父亲。不论我去哪里，我会突然听到他的声音，然后，他会离我很近。我会跟他一起散步，让自己和他步调一致，并同他讲话。”

芬把头靠回椅子里，闭上眼睛，“就好像他去过我在的地方，为我准备好了一切，以至于处处都有他的身影。有时，我甚至觉得为了等他的到来，我必须推迟我起程的时间。”

“那他来了吗？”

“他总会出现。这难道不奇怪吗？”

“是的。”

阿德尔海德想，芬的声音不同于以往了。虽然芬如往常那样讲话时并不看阿德尔海德，但他的思绪并没有跟阿德尔海德在一起。

“你和父亲今天去了哪里？”她问。

“我们去了小树林，走了很长一段距离。父亲不怎么说话，但是不如在家里那般无聊。外面风景可真不错，但又很陌生。几乎什么都看不到了，只能看到叶子不停地落。”

“是的。”阿德尔海德说。

然后，阿德尔海德低头看着芬的脸，比起出国前，芬瘦了许多，也苍白了许多。

“芬，”阿德尔海德说，“当你……当你在外面旅行的时候，我没有和你在一起吗？”

芬笑了，点点头，说：

“你存在于你的信里。父亲从来不写信。但大部分时候，你待在家里，而这是我最想要去的地方。”

芬说这些时并没有握着她的手，这让她感到有些不适。

猛然间，她意识到，她沉浸在芬从她身边离开的恐惧中。

如果芬被超乎他们平静生活的事物吸引，她要对芬说些什么？如果他离她而去，她还剩下什么？

阿德尔海德觉得科特似乎就站在这屋子里，召唤芬去外面的黄树林里转悠，那里空气凛冽清新。芬欢快地跳跃，他们一起离开，头也不回。

阿德尔海德觉得科特比她要强大，这让她对科特心存恨意。她在寻找一件能保护自己的武器。她多么期望那么爱她的芬现在能放松地躺在她面前，就如同他以往那样，脸放在她的手心里。但她知道，此刻芬不会那么做。

阿德尔海德觉得极其委屈、孤独，她变得害怕起来，对赤红幸福的旧日渴望又燃烧起来。要是那快乐能够带走她就好了，这样她就有可能和拥有一切的科特保持对立。

“母亲，给我唱首歌吧。”芬说。

“好。”阿德尔海德回答道。

她穿过屋子，脚步声大于平常。阿德尔海德脸色红润，眼睛散发着光芒。她双手坚定地放在钢琴上。芬注意到了这一点，颇为讶异。但光线太暗，他并没有看到阿德尔海德脸上的表情。

你爱上在那舒适茅舍角落里的农民？

你和他一起生活，食宿共享；

你平静地酿酒，快乐地做饭；

生锈的轮子、生锈的针在你的照料下光可鉴人；

你感恩上帝赐予的阳光雨露。

但不爱任何人的她会悲伤哭泣！



你爱上拥有金制竖琴的诗人？

你倾慕于他在弦丝上弹奏的歌曲；

你在花簇满地的荒原和他相遇；

你的微笑是他来去的指令，

他的思绪沉浸于你的快乐。

但不爱任何人的她会悲伤哭泣！



你爱上在果园里打猎的小公子？

你向你母亲提出请求离开她的监护；

你献给他你的初吻你的爱；

当他高高在上驱使骏马和猎犬的时候，

你将在地上匍匐，承受他抛来的荣耀与食物，

但不爱任何人的她会悲伤哭泣！

阿德尔海德坐在那里没有动，低着头。

这歌曲击碎了她的骄傲。她浑身颤抖，大颗的泪珠滴到手上。她努力振作自己，但她感到前所未有的无力渺小。

阿德尔海德想到了芬，惊慌地看了看周围。但芬看不到她，她默默地流着泪。阿德尔海德头抵着钢琴，然后她的手坠落在了键盘上，她被琴声吓了一跳，从座位上站了起来。

“真是首奇怪的歌。”芬说。

屋子里如此闷，阿德尔海德几乎无法忍受。

“我好多年都没有唱这首歌了，以前，我经常唱它。”

“当你遇见父亲的时候，他是什么样子？”芬问道。

阿德尔海德背朝芬站着，颤抖的手不断翻阅着乐谱。

“他像现在这样帅气吗？”

“是的，不，我不知道他帅不帅。”

芬静静听着。

“他……他很有魅力。”

“他的确是那样，的确是，”芬像孩子听到好故事那样开心地拍着手，“他也很有主人派头，不是吗？所以所有人都注定要追随他？”

“是的。”阿德尔海德说。

“父亲是一个国王。”

阿德尔海德的心脏抽搐着，她全神贯注地听着。她感到芬站在离自己很近的地方，并且做了一件足以毁灭她的事情。她无法转身，无法靠近他，恳求他停下来。

“我希望我有个弟弟。”芬说。

“你觉得孤单吗？”

“不，不是那样。如果有个弟弟，那他应该继承这个王国。”





第十七章


那时，芬交了一个朋友，然而，这朋友不是他自己选择的，而是处在焦虑中的科特给他安排的，因为在科特看来，芬自己交不到更好的朋友了。

他的名字叫汉斯，他和芬从小就认识。汉斯比芬大一岁，没有芬高，但更强壮，金黄色的头发，明亮的眼睛，性格也非常活泼。

汉斯的父亲是个小个子男人，在账房里做最普通的工作。他和他的妻子生活中没什么运气可言，除了他们的儿子。但有时，他们也为汉斯的未来担心，因为汉斯的想法很明显而且很广泛。

虽然汉斯已经长得比他父亲高，但他对自己的各个方面都很不满意。

首先，他不想坐在办公室里，而是想去外面的世界闯闯。从他还是小男孩的时候起，他就确信，外面的世界要比别人口中的大很多。

现在汉斯已长大成人，对自己的需求和能力非常了解，但却哪里都不能去，于是他勇敢地找到房子的主人，跟科特说了说事情的情况。

科特很喜欢汉斯，希望留他在家里做事，但科特很快发现，没什么工作能引起汉斯的兴趣。科特问汉斯，他将来想成为什么样的人。汉斯说他想成为一名工程师。

科特看着他，心里不禁感叹，汉斯的眼神足以炸裂岩石。

科特答应会帮助汉斯，但当汉斯唱着歌儿走下楼梯时，科特却仍旧陷在自己的沉思里。

时间流逝。汉斯一直坚持自己的梦想，他和其他所有人都明白，汉斯正有条不紊地为梦想奋斗。科特一直都在注意汉斯，当汉斯再次拜访时，科特显得很高兴。但阿德尔海德不喜欢汉斯，因为汉斯说话聒噪，走起路来脚步沉重。

一天晚上，科特站在汉斯的屋子里，用一种前所未有的方式跟汉斯聊天，“我是你父亲的老板，我父亲是你祖父的老板。我儿子则永远不会成为你的老板。因为你决意要走自己的路，成为你自己的老板。即便没有人帮助你，你也会那么做。没错。但你可能会变得愤世嫉俗，在使用你的才华力量时变得疑心重重，心胸狭窄。我把你从这一切中解救出来，给你帮助。现在，我希望你能回报我。”

汉斯握住科特向他伸出的手，不舒服地站着，没有理解科特的意思。科特疲惫地坐下来，很久没有说话。

最终，科特从他的沉思中回过神来，看着眼前这个无法洞晓他的年轻人，科特被那眼神感动，“我并不希望你是我的儿子，我有一个儿子，他是个好孩子，我很爱他。他没有你的意志力，但他也不需要。他的未来平坦无比。他可以给你很多你没有的东西。”

科特听着自己说的话，这些话不断变成对芬的道歉，祈祷芬的原谅。科特痛苦不已，而汉斯，看到了他的难过，以为这大房子里发生了可怕的事情。

“你能试着成为芬的朋友吗？”

汉斯非常愿意。

科特看着汉斯，估量着他的力量。科特环视了汉斯那狭小的、屋顶很低的房间，除了汉斯工作需要的工具就别无他物。他望向窗外，蓝天下一片脏兮兮的灰色屋顶交织交错，成百上千的烟囱里炊烟袅袅，院子和街道上的噪音填满了这间屋子，窗户的玻璃已碎，用纸糊着。

然后，他看着坐在这样嘈杂环境中强壮的汉斯。科特知道，站在这里的他，绝不是扮演汉斯的慈善家或是他父亲的老板的角色，对汉斯打开自家富有的门。站在这里的科特，仅仅是一位恳求者。

“你知道你们小的时候曾一起玩耍。”

当科特说完这句，他竟激动起来，因为他想起，芬从来没有玩过什么。汉斯也想着同样的事情，但在这种情况下却不知道该说什么。此刻，沉默对于两人而言变得沉重而煎熬。

为了打破沉默，汉斯问道，芬是不是生病了。

科特立刻明白，汉斯一定很久没有注意到这位脸色苍白、生性沉默的房子的继承人了。

科特站了起来，厌烦了谨慎地回答。他搭着汉斯的肩膀，看着汉斯，那眼神让汉斯一辈子都不会忘记，“请你作为大卫(1)，带着你的竖琴来我们身边，当你自己愿意的时候，或者当我们请你的时候。”




————————————————————

(1) 《圣经》中，大卫被神称为“合我心意的人”。





第十八章


为了迎接汉斯，芬做的第一件事就是重新整理他之前的房间，这样，汉斯来看芬的时候就有地方待了。

这样的安排没什么不正常的。因为理所当然，老屋子不能让陌生人踏入。但科特立刻觉得他寄托在汉斯身上的希望破碎了。

有时，芬对汉斯的到来感到很开心。

但他们无法在一起聊天。

虽然身在芬的房间里，但汉斯却一直在想着他工作的计划和所遇到的困难，其中最简单的对于芬来说都是无法被逾越克服的，而且，芬对他朋友脑袋里的想法一无所知。他跟所有人讲话的方式都一样，他说的话不是问题，就是答案或者他的意见。

因而，大多数情况下是汉斯讲话，而且当他讲话时会完全沉浸在自己的世界中，根本没有注意到芬开始白日做梦了。

当芬让汉斯做他自己的计算或是其他事情时，他会愉快地坐在一旁，看着汉斯与那些数字和绘图缠斗。

汉斯皱起的额头，还有那急切的、不耐烦的动作，都让芬觉得好笑。他好像坐在赛马场，或是人们参加竞技的地方，充满期待地等候着这位工程师在解决问题的那一刻将铅笔一扔并发出的兴奋的吼声。

芬的脸上洋溢着欢乐，就如同是他自己赢得了胜利那般喜悦，而他并不知道那是哪种胜利，也不知道这胜利意味着什么。

但有时，越来越频繁地，芬感到对他而言汉斯过于活跃急躁。

于是，有那么几日，当汉斯拜访芬时，芬会躲起来，而仅仅是汉斯的露面都会引起芬身体上的疼痛。汉斯那强大的眼神，那洪亮欢快的声音，还有他充满意义的话语，都让芬觉得晕眩。

芬坐在那里，满是痛苦和委屈，因为他无法让汉斯离开。而汉斯也很少会注意到这一点。当他注意到芬的情绪时，汉斯总是会陷入无限的自责和郁闷中；而芬必得说服汉斯，不是他想的那般。

然后，芬就屈服了，就像一个无助的病人屈服于一项新的治疗方法一样，然而随着这方法而来的必然有新的折磨。当他在备感折磨的时候，他不停地想起他的父亲，父亲承受的痛苦更多，而他却帮不了父亲。

芬最喜欢的时间是他们一起出去的时候。

他们驾车或者骑马。然而，两人却从未达成过一致，芬想要慢慢地骑马，快快地驾车，而汉斯则恰恰相反。他们总是渴望顺从对方，但每次都会依着芬的喜好。

芬虽然不喜欢外出，可一旦他真的去了，便会开心起来。而且他总是希望汉斯可以和他一起。芬在人群面前总是很羞涩，有他的朋友在场，会让他安心许多。

他们总是会在大街上走，因为如果出城，芬会觉得太冷。他会搂着汉斯的胳膊，跟随汉斯的步伐，心里默默地为他骄傲。芬喜欢在嘈杂的街道上听汉斯洪亮的声音，还有那有力的脚步声，以及他的拐杖点在路面上发出的声音。

芬有的时候会开口讲话。

大部分是关于他的旅行。他总是能把他的想法准确地表达出来，像他对他母亲讲话那样。似乎这样的生活，还有几乎淹没掉他声音的嘈杂声让他感到更自由安全。

虽然汉斯并不关心芬旅行中的所见所闻，但芬的语言带着色彩和微光，让他迷恋不已。

但当街上的噪音戛然而止，芬会立刻沉默并显得非常害怕。而且，若两人在人群中彼此分开一小会儿，且汉斯没有听到芬所讲的话，要求芬再重复一遍，或者他仅听到了只言片语，要求芬进一步解释或予以确认，芬会突然变得疲惫，心情立刻就变了。

芬会被街头生活吸引而停下脚步。他会指给朋友看，并以此作为聊天的话题。汉斯会接着芬的话讲，说一些挑逗的观察给芬听，这让芬觉得很有意思，但不久芬就觉得很懊恼，因为汉斯的话破坏了芬所看到的景色。

他们从来不讨论女人。

芬会沉默，因为他的想法模糊而保守。而汉斯的生活也不值得总被提及。而且，他们本能地知道，在这一话题上他们的共同点少之又少，且都不希望过分介入彼此的生活。

只有一次，芬去了汉斯的家里。

那是那间小屋里的一次常规宴请，芬很高兴去参加。

他欣然地看着两位矮小的老人，他们不论站着还是坐着都双手相叠微微鞠躬，不知如何向这房子的小主人表达敬意和感激。他们认定芬一定生气了，因为汉斯坏了规矩，选择了自己的未来，他们替汉斯百般解释。

然而他们的解释中无不透露着对自己小心呵护着的儿子的骄傲，好似如果不紧紧捧着他，他会掉下来摔得粉碎一样。

芬非常理解他们，被他们感动了。他把汉斯夸得不得了，预言汉斯将有大作为，当看到汉斯双亲眼中的欢乐时，芬自己也开心极了。

芬与汉斯的父母进行深入的交谈，听着他们表达自己对汉斯的爱，这情景让汉斯彻底困惑，而芬看着满脸迷茫的汉斯觉得十分可笑。

当芬停止讲话时，然后整个屋子都陷入沉默，情形尴尬。

后来，芬和汉斯站在房间里望向窗外。

芬的眼睛游荡在成百上千的屋顶之间，太阳照在石板上，还有那红色的瓦片上和发亮的电话线。每一面上，小小的阁楼窗户都自成一格，有的挂着印花棉布窗帘，种着天香竹和天竺葵，还有黄色的小鸟在白色的笼子里跳动。

有一个地方挂着一个有精美绘画的长着蕨类植物的木盒子，植物已经变成了铁棕色，但依旧骄傲挺直地站着，中间的地方还有一棵冷杉。在另一个地方，窗帘直接飘出窗外，挥舞飘荡如同一面旗帜。有两只麻雀在水槽里跳来跳去。还有一只关在笼子里的鸟在尖声而甜蜜地唱歌。

“这一切是多么美好！”芬说道。

汉斯并没有这么觉得。

但，在那个时候，芬注意到了靠旁边的一个窗户，这窗户离他那么近，好似他一伸手就可以够到。

窗户是打开的。房间里有鲜花，还有一只鸟在笼子里，安静而不停地从一处跳到另一处。在这些鲜花后面坐着一位缝纫的姑娘。芬可以看到她的后背，和一点儿她的脸蛋，还能听到缝纫机的声音。

“看。”芬压低声音说。

汉斯走了过来，立刻朝那个方向看去。

“那是玛丽，”他说，“她是个裁缝。”

其实，不论是这对话的内容，还是汉斯说话的语气都没什么不对劲的地方。但汉斯说得如此大声且毫无顾忌，以致伤到了芬。女孩此刻也闻声抬头看着他们，笑了笑。

于是，充满鲜花、小鸟以及温暖的屋顶的整个画面都被阴影遮住。芬叹了口气，从窗户旁走开了。

晚饭时，汉斯一家人和芬坐在一起，吃完饭，他们从芬身上感到一种不可抑制的忧伤。

芬看着他们每一个人的脸，知道他们都在为了他而克制各自的快乐。他想，如果他不在场，这一家子会忙碌而开心地沉浸在工作和对彼此的信任中。

在他们友好的话语和善良的微笑后，芬不禁开始为他这位安静的客人感到可怜。但他觉得他们更加为科特感到惋惜，而他自己则应当受到责备。

然后，芬匆匆地辞别了汉斯一家。





第十九章


当汉斯和芬在树林里驾车时，一条小狗钻到了车轮底下，伤得很严重。

他们两人都立刻从车上跳了下来。汉斯跪在地上，将大口喘气的小狗抱在怀里。

“给我你的手帕。”汉斯说道。

但汉斯没有收到手帕，他烦躁地抬头看芬。

芬无动于衷。

他俯身看着小狗发光的眼睛，眼神奇怪而专注。芬并没有在想受伤的是动物还是人，也没有想小狗能不能被救或者他自己要做些什么。

“芬！”

芬依旧没有反应。他看着死神那张伟大的脸。黑房子的门被狠狠地甩开，芬看向黑暗深处。他的灵魂满是虔诚的敬畏。他没有感觉，看不到任何事物，但生命正在他眼前消逝。

汉斯无语地盯着芬，被芬脸上的表情吓到了，他不知道如何理解这表情，变得越来越不安。

“把你的手帕给我，芬。”

芬抬头，把自己的手帕递给了汉斯，说：“我没想到要这么做。”

汉斯没有回答，不久，小狗死了，汉斯将小狗狠狠地扔到树丛里，这让芬几乎要打他。

他们回到车上，沉默地继续前行。芬满脑子都是他所看到的一切，对汉斯的不安没有丝毫察觉。突然，芬让车夫停下。

“你一定不要介意，汉斯。”芬说道。

“我打算在这里下车，我能自己走回家，我想独自待会儿。”汉斯跳下车，连再见都没有说就离开了。芬并没有介意。他让车夫关上门，自己缩到一个角落里，然后回家了。

阿德尔海德去老屋子里看芬，却无法让芬说出自己脑中的想法。她朝他笑笑，握着他的手，开始为他唱歌。

但芬沉默地坐着，心不在焉。




一些日子后的一个晚上，芬和汉斯穿过街道沿着运河散步。河上，小船排成一排，河岸另一边，是一座古老的城堡，城堡的玻璃都已破碎，但绿色的屋顶却散发着魅力。

“让我们在这里坐一会儿。”芬说。

他们坐在码头上。河流在他们的脚下愤怒地暗涌。河上的船只撞到一起又漂开来。汉斯用自己的拐杖敲着堤坝。

“威尼斯像这样吗？”他问道。

“不，”芬说，“那里要更美好。因为那里更陌生。”

汉斯开心地笑了，芬什么都没说，低头看着河流。

然后他们听到一声喊叫。

他们立刻站起来，向发出叫喊声的地方跑去，当他们走近一点儿，在河里看到一个溺水的小孩。

“这里，芬，帮我。”

汉斯跳进一艘船，笨拙地摆弄船桨。但芬径直跑向那孩子的方向，想都没想立刻跳进河里。

芬不会游泳，汉斯不得不先救他。然后，极度艰难地，汉斯又救起了小孩。当他们回到科特那里，大家先是被吓了一跳，然后发现芬没什么大碍，于是大家都坐在客厅里，开始讨论起这件事。

阿德尔海德双手握着芬的手，时不时拍拍它，或者用力压一下。科特情绪高涨地在客厅走来走去。

“你怎么会想到要跳下去？”汉斯问，“你知道你不会游泳。”

“我都没有想这么多。”芬安静地回答。

科特站在芬面前，对他点点头。阿德尔海德眼睛闪烁着泪珠，亲吻芬的额头。

汉斯看着他们一家人，气红了脸。

他想到，芬可能会淹死，或者那小孩可能会淹死，或者他们两人都可能淹死。然后他又想起在小树林的场景，当小狗死去的时候。他无法理解这些人的想法。汉斯没有看这一家里的任何一人，他努力让自己的声音趋于平静，说道：

“你没有权利做出那样的行为。那是非常愚蠢的。”

“是的。”芬说。

但此刻科特把手放在汉斯的肩膀上，看着汉斯，那眼神让汉斯突然想到他那怯懦的父亲。

“是的。”科特说，“芬竟然不会游泳，真是太愚蠢了。”

然后，科特的儿子被决定应该去学习游泳。





第二十章


阿德尔海德坐在那里，手里捧着书，但并没有阅读。

天色已晚。芬一直和她待在一起，直到他道了晚安然后去休息。科特不在家中。房子里外都一般寂静。

她有一种感觉，好似这世界上只有她一个人。

阿德尔海德并不快乐。

那段长久单调的日子所带给她的内心的平静已从这房子里消失。她无法看清自己未来的路：和芬在一起的时候不行，她自己一个人的时候也不行，更不用提当科特在这屋子里的时候。

甚至在教堂里，她都无法感到安稳。有时，她离开教堂时的心情比她进入教堂时还要沉重；有时，她根本不敢踏入教堂，当听到教堂走廊里风琴的召唤时，她却转身离开。

她长久地坐着，目视前方，白皙的手叠放在膝盖上。她想试试看她能否把这事情想清楚。她之前也曾这样努力过，但从未成功。

首先，是回到老屋子。

这是所有事情的开端，她禁不住想，老屋子是所有事情的源头，因为，事实上，她内心里从未真正地战胜它。与之关联的回忆汹涌地袭来，她根本无力抵挡，这让她血液沸腾，双眼模糊，而她却不知为了什么。

她承受着绵长的恐惧，而这恐惧她既无法解释从何而来，亦无法驱散。有时是芬，芬那苍白的脸让她害怕。有时是科特，科特变得越来越沉默，总是在酝酿他那些想法。

她陷入一阵令人绝望的懊悔中，而她却不知道自己如何犯下了罪过。然后她内心充满对复仇的恐惧，而她知道没有人想要伤害她。她感到她住在一幢墙体充满密格的房子中，而一旦密格之中的文件曝光，将毁灭现存的所有一切。她感到好似走在神秘的地窖上，那地窖掩盖着诡异的罪过的痕迹。

阿德尔海德疲倦地用手托着头，又把手放下。她在椅子里直了直上半身，将脸靠近摆在她身前桌子上的玫瑰。然后她拿起书，不久又再次把书放在一边。

然后，科特来了。

科特朝阿德尔海德点了点头，算是打个招呼，然后走到房间里较远的那一边，拿了本书坐了下来。

阿德尔海德怯懦地看着科特。她听到科特在翻书，于是想知道他读的是什么书。阿德尔海德开口问科特，科特头也不抬地回答了她，沉默加倍地充斥着房间。

阿德尔海德叹了口气，站起来准备去睡觉，“晚安，科特。”

科特合上书，随手扔到桌子上。阿德尔海德停下脚步，看着他。然后他问道：

“今天汉斯来了吗？”

阿德尔海德又坐回到椅子里。此刻，科特已站了起来，在屋子里踱步。阿德尔海德一边等待一边听着科特的脚步声，直到她无法忍受，“科特！”

科特停了下来，看着她。

“科特，芬会死的，如果汉斯一直和他在一起。”

“是的，”科特说道，声音轻轻地，充满悲伤，“芬会死掉，你会死掉，我也将死掉，但汉斯会活着。”

“你想拿芬怎么办，科特？”

“难道你已经忘记我想要什么了吗？”

科特看着她，那眼神伤到了她。

“不知你的愿望是不是同我的一样，科特。”她问道。

“不。”

科特冷静地回答道，口气里没有怒气，但毫不犹豫。

听到这样的回答，阿德尔海德从椅子里跳了起来，“你的愿望从来都跟我不同。从不！你成功地说服我，威吓我，强迫我。但我从来都不想那样，科特，从不！即便是我同意的时候。”

“阿德尔海德，不要再谈陈年旧事了。”

“现在呢，科特？现在我离你越来越远，而你越来越不能理解我。在我身上，有一种力量比那时将我们分开的东西强大一千倍。”

科特看着阿德尔海德，眼中闪过一阵愤怒，“阿德尔海德，我身上也有。”

科特站在她面前，她感到科特比平常似乎要高一些，而他的脸看着出奇地年轻。

“芬来了。”科特说道。

阿德尔海德无法站立，于是坐回到椅子里。

“你说话的方式就好像他只是你的儿子，不是我的。”阿德尔海德说道。

阿德尔海德盯着科特的脸。她无法摆脱科特看上去如此年轻的想法。他的头发没有一点儿变白的迹象，他走路轻盈挺拔，眼睛充满力量和自信，和以往无二。

阿德尔海德身体前倾，盯着科特的脸，寻找蛛丝马迹。她当然应该能找到悲伤留给他的伤口，岁月带给他的痕迹。

科特没有看她。他双手交叉搂着脖子站在那里，眼神迷离，“阿德尔海德，你说对了，就像你说的那样，现在我们身上有种力量比当初分开我们的强大千倍。我们凡人总是认为，当不幸来临，后面就会是好运，不幸一定会终结。而且，失去爱人的男人和失去洋娃娃的孩子没有什么不同。除了时间，来来去去，熄灭了一盏灯，点燃了一堆柴，然后又熄灭了柴。”

科特放下胳膊，无声地站了会儿，“阿德尔海德。”

他没再说什么。他环视了屋子，又看了看她，就好像他刚从他的思考中醒过来一样。然后他走向窗户，望向广场，那里的灯已经全部熄灭了。

阿德尔海德大睁着双眼盯着科特站立的地方。

很多年了，她都忽略了他的存在，这些年她都去了哪里？她都在做些什么？

她现在又注意到了他，起初遥远而模糊，当她又一次站在老屋子的时候，就好像一次吵架、一种伤痛的回忆那般。然后，他靠近了一些，就是在那次他警告她芬不能像她那样活着。再然后，一点儿一点儿，通过芬，通过他的恐惧和他的爱，通过他每句话，他接近了她，越来越近，影响也越来越大。

她把椅子的扶手握得那么用力以至于她的关节都泛白了。

现在，那神秘的地窖之门的铰链嘎吱作响，罪过显现。现在墙体里秘密的暗格都被打开，老旧的文件都公布于众。

现在，她和他之间的一切都消失了，而他们之外的一切也都不存在了。他站在她身旁，她伸伸手就能触摸到他。她失去了儿子也失去了上帝。他的话像暴风雨般扫过她的心灵，他的眼睛注视着她。

她想要站起来逃走，但却无法动弹。她感到一阵晕眩，脚下的大地似乎在后退。

她听到许多说话的声音，向她诉说一个很久以前早已被人忘记的故事，一个记录在家族档案里用于娱乐和对后人进行指导的传说，而后人大约会对这传说加以不同于原作者的评论。

还有其他话语，嘲笑和兴奋的声音，都在向她耳语，这一切都是幻想。芬是属于她的，而不是他，他所有的自信、力量都会在遇到那深爱着母亲、苍白而安静的男孩时变得粉碎。

话语中还有圣歌、赞美诗、风琴声和令人难忘的对罪恶、宽恕和基督的荣耀的话语。教堂地窖的凉风吹过她滚烫的额头。所有的钟一起敲响，就好像是为了一个灵魂之需。

她听到了这一切，而这一切就像空中任意的声音一样消失了。

所有的话语在她混乱的思绪前混成一团，演绎成旧时光里的一个夜晚，一个充满灯光和欢乐的夜晚。她看到那时的人们，她听到她自己的声音。

然后，突然地，所有的声音都被老屋子里的寂静镇压。

蜡烛在壁炉架上燃烧。她坐在那里，盯着红色的壁炉。科特在说话……那是以前的科特，“我会用生命和快乐作为赢得你的心的赌注。我会和你说话，强求你，征服你。我会拥抱你，拒绝你，然后追求你，宽恕你。如果我没有赢得你，我将抛弃你。”

她站起来，双手拍着她的脑袋说道：

“科特，科特。”

科特转过头，看着她苍白的脸。

阿德尔海德抬起头看着科特，在科特的眼睛里寻找自己的影子，或者仅仅是过去时光的一丝念想儿，一点儿记忆。

但她找不到。对于科特，这世界上除了他的快乐、他的恐惧、他的挣扎之外就再无其他，以往如此，现在亦如此。只是，这一切都不再围绕着她。

“阿德尔海德，你生病了吗？”

“没有，没有。”

阿德尔海德大声笑起来。科特握着她的手，把她领到一把椅子前。阿德尔海德任科特摆布，眼睛却一直看着科特的脸。

然后，她突然猛推开科特。

她微笑着，对自己的愚蠢摇摇头，然后在屋子里走了一圈。她说她很好，让科特离开，快点儿离开。

然后科特走了。

她看着科特离开时关上的门，好似那是她最后一次看到科特。然后她转身，看着镜子，镜子里呈现出她整个人。

慢慢地，她走向镜子，坐了下来，手托着头，眼睛盯着镜子里自己的脸。

教堂尖塔里的钟敲了一下，两下，她都没有听到。然后有人在广场上尖叫。她站了起来，拿了一支蜡烛，离开了屋子。

她穿过长长的走廊，走上楼梯，小心翼翼地，好像她是小偷一样。她站在科特和芬的卧室门前，听里面的动静。然后她站在老屋子门外。她凝神听着，没有任何声音。她微微打开老屋子的门，里面一片漆黑。

她迅速走进去，径直走到墙上的暗格处，打开暗格，双手颤抖地拿出那泛黄的文件。

然后她盯着科特和自己的名字，写在文件最后面，又被划掉的名字。





第二十一章


芬站在科特房间里的窗户边上，头倚着窗户框，看着楼下的院子，看门人的孩子们正在那里玩耍。

芬是按照惯例前来向科特道早安的，科特让芬等一会儿，等他写完手头的那封信。此刻，科特早已封上信封，但芬没有注意到。他在观看楼下孩子们玩游戏，为了看得更清楚，他还往前探了探头。

不久，孩子们被喊进屋子了。于是，他头倚着窗框望着灰色的天空。他想起汉斯，那天早晨汉斯去了巴黎，并且将要在那里待两年。

科特静静地坐着。他看着芬的侧脸，芬的额头是那么白皙，芬的眼睑如此沉重地抬着，芬的嘴巴疲惫而软弱。

“芬！”

芬惊了一下，转过身来。

“你去送汉斯了吗？”

“去了。”

芬坐在他刚刚站过的窗户旁的位置，低着头，双手摊在膝盖上。他把百叶窗的绳子卷到自己手指头上，然后又解开。

“你会想汉斯吗？”

“哦，会的。”

“我会想念汉斯的，”科特说，“汉斯属于新秩序中最棒的那些人，是现代诗歌的英雄……工程师，你知道的，没有人能够原汁原味地将他展现在舞台上，因为他从来不会表演单一的一个角色。他很强大，有勇气去挥洒他的力量。对于我们来说，他似乎缺乏教养，而他也无法认同我们。他没有祖先，因为他就是祖先，他建立了他自己的朝代。”

“是的。”芬附和道。

然后他们沉默地坐了一阵子。

科特心中没有任何疑虑。他知道他想要的是什么，然后索要他想要的。他不会说温和的话，而是富有力量的话。芬对此很清楚。他坐在那里就像个囚犯，等待着他的判决，每一分钟对他来讲都是煎熬。

然后，他们抬起头，看着彼此的眼睛。

两人相互估量对方的力量。芬的绝望如此强大，就像科特无法放弃的希望那样强大，这希望是科特唯一所能依赖的。

“你知道你是天生的艺术家吗，芬？”

芬伤心地笑笑，摇摇头。

“你是的，”科特说，“关于这一点儿毫无疑问。当你在国外旅行时，你的信中充满你对所见美景的喜悦。你的旅程是一段穿越高贵画廊的漫长的过程。在海边，在街道上，在山里，在每一处你都捕捉到生活，把它挂在你的墙上，然后你会坐下来慢慢欣赏。”

“是吗？”

“要不是你出生在富有的家庭中，你会不可救赎。你可能成为个画家，不，一个作家。”

“成为画家或作家有那么糟糕吗？”

“文学对于我们现代人来讲有什么用？”科特说道，“文学能带领我们去哪里？文学如何影响我们的生活？如果那些老诗人活到今天，他们早就变成商人，或电工，或北极的领航员。看看你身边，芬，我们读的书，看的画，上演的戏剧，难道不是都像街头的交响乐队，在人们散步的时候表演一个小时？那都是些疲惫的人们，在上床睡觉前想听一点儿音乐。乐队演奏完小曲儿，得到钱和掌声，而我们乐于看到这表演恰如其分地完成。但是，诗人，芬，是那响彻山冈的孤独号角。我们会扔下手中的犁，静静地听，抬头看，因为那些文字对于我们来说如此稀有而又如此强大，我们从未听到过这些音符却又对它们如此熟悉。然后我们眼中闪过光芒。然后，那些压弯我们脊梁的伤痛，那些让我们挺拔的欢乐，还有我们的希望，瞬间都拥有了颜色和光芒。我们渐渐衰老，号角召唤我们，在山的那头，去那新的绿地，那里有更好的生活。”

“父亲。”

芬抬起头，但却不知如何表达自己的想法。

“难道你不认为诗人首先应该是一个……一个跟他人一样的男人，胸中充满勇气，腰上挎着利剑？他用诗歌欢送人们去战场或去婚礼，去跳舞或者战死疆场。他是世俗的一部分，首先出现在群体中。”

“诗人也会坐在女士的闺房里唱歌。”芬说。

科特点点头说：

“是的，但我们如今的诗人却只会坐在女士的闺房里唱歌了。只要有闲逛的女人，还有经历过两场战争，两个国王，有两个丈夫的女人在；只要星星游离在天空，孩子们抓不住灌木丛中的飞鸟，就会有许多光阴的游荡者存在。但是，不必在意这些，芬。不必在意。你就看看今天坐在交响乐团中的那些人，你会坐在他们中间吗？他们都是些病态的人，吟唱他们各自的病魔。有人犯了相思病，有人淫秽，还有人嗜酒。有人吟诵他那写在羊皮纸上的信仰，有人出售有关他疑虑的六便士的书。他们那懦弱的意志在愚蠢的诗句中颤抖，还有人借用旧时代的血腥恐怖来陶醉他那苍白的想象。你觉得一个自由意志的人会选择把自己放在这些艺术家中吗？”

芬抬起头，用他那安静的眼睛望着科特，“父亲，谁是有自由意志的人？你吗？”

科特将手放在芬的肩膀上，并看着他，“你是啊，芬，你是有自由意志的人，如果你愿意的话。”

“父亲。”芬伸出手，好似小孩子向大人索要东西那般。但科特无情地看着芬。科特的眼神充满力量和光芒，芬试图躲开那灼人的眼神，却无法做到。他试图说些什么，但却保持着沉默。

然后，科特在屋子里走来走去，步伐稳重有力，他一会儿说话，一会儿沉默，但从不肯让芬从他那严厉的掌控中逃离一步。

科特用话语抓住芬，把芬托到一个一切都很伟大、美丽但有点儿冷酷的地方，再把他摔回到他自己那个黑暗的角落里。然后重新又抓住他，把他带到高处。

然而，当科特停下来时，对于芬来讲，就好像听到号角齐鸣，宣告其他话语紧接着要来了，更加宏大、严肃，充满爱意但却承受不起。

“你是对的，芬，我不是一个有自由意志的人，我从来都不是。我被筑成我的房子、养育我家族的传统束缚，当我无法再支撑这些传统，我的世界就会崩塌，但依旧无法让我自由。那是很沉重的时光，芬。我无法理解这些，你看，我一直战斗到了最后。那时我很年轻，身强力壮，而且我在恋爱中。你喜欢那间老屋子，你能听到那些传奇人物在那屋子里动人忧伤地歌唱。记住，芬，我也是那些人中的一员。我也曾经平静而骄傲地站在那里，在那儿，没有人能看得到我，除了房子的建造者和他的妻子，总是遥远又封闭地躲藏在老屋子古老的威力中。对房子建造者毫无保留地打开心扉，我像一个被打倒的人。但我无法躲入角落独自神伤，因为我还有你，芬。那时你还是一个小孩子，我不知道你未来的路是怎样的。我只知道一件事情，就是你永远都不会和你的妻子坐在那里，坐在那硕大的、立刻让人显得渺小的椅子上，那里一切总是很舒适很安心。我是最后一个坐在那里的人。老屋子的传统在我这里终结。后来我不得不试着在这个我无法理解的世界中找到我自己的路。我不得不经历一切我极其讨厌、并让我的快乐消失殆尽的事物。对我自己而言，已无所求，我是一个被束缚的、受过伤的人。但我还有你，芬，我得知道在一切虚无的跳舞、调情、唱歌背后，他们是不是在诚实、正确地筑建这个世界。或者这世界于我眼前的没什么两样，那我是不是不应该尽全力将我的孩子带到这险山恶水中，让野兽把他撕成碎片，这一切考量中我都独自一人。你母亲搬去这房子旁边的老房子住了，因为在这里，她无法快乐。在那里，她找到了平静。但我不需要避难所。不论我在哪里，我都是在家里：我只是想看到你，还有你的孩子能够幸福安康生活成长的地方……我不遗余力地寻找，南部北部，东边西边。我读了他们的书……那些轻松的书在我手中像肥皂泡一样破裂，而那些富有力量的书我理解起来很费劲。没有什么他们的绿色远景是我没有在自己的房间里看到过的，也没有什么亮剑没在我眼前闪过光。我没有被自己的苦楚蒙蔽双眼，被流行话欺骗，也没有害怕那些谩骂声。只要我还能看到路，我就顺着我的路一直往前走，芬。我凝视着最远处，在那里我所看到的只有恐惧和疯狂。芬，我不知道，可能是你母亲的上帝救了我。也可能是我那个自己开船驶入港湾然后在新大地上盖起房子的祖先。或许是在那些充满焦虑孤独的日子里，你来向我道早安和晚安时，你完全信任地放在我手掌中的那双小手。我说不清楚。我敢肯定，是我对你的爱让我得到了升华。我爬到了凡人所能爬到的山峰高度。一切在我脚下都像一片云，憧憬、幸福、生计和苦恼。我看不到我的房子所在的山谷。但在白云之外，越过山峰，我看到我们一代又一代忙碌努力的地方，一天一天朝着目标前进，虽然这目标我们看不到，但它就在那里，因为路就在那里。我还看到土地，从我站的山峰之处，看到你还有你的子孙后代的乐土。那是一片我所不知道的土地，一片我看着陌生的土地，那里的人们有不一样的习惯和信仰，有不同形式的爱情和荣耀。我在那场将老屋子的门猛地推开的暴风雨中看到这一切，芬，那是很神奇的时刻，是我一生中最强大、最快乐的时刻。”

科特站在窗边，双臂交叉在胸前。他看着他的儿子，遗憾地笑笑。芬静静地坐在椅子里，仰着头，闭着眼。

“然后，我就让你为你的旅行做好准备，芬，我无法给你指路，因为我是被束缚的人，我无法和你同行。我带给你书籍和指引者，他们帮你打开世界之门。我让你知晓你想骑行穿越的迷雾。我已没有任何顾虑，因为我无所求，我已看过那片雾霭。你长大了，你健康聪明。之后我便慢慢地等待，渴望当我从自家阳台向你挥手，看你去征服世界的那一天尽快到来。我就是在等待着那一天。啊，我看到过那些穷鬼，饥饿难耐，伤痕累累，盲目地冲向新世界，因为那世界不可能比旧世界更加糟糕。我听到他们号召建立新的法律，因为他们违反了旧的。他们被赶出他们的茅屋，带着他们的包裹，还有对新世界的一丝希望，坐上了移民的船舶。但你，你没有做错什么，也没复仇的理由。你有国王的儿子一样的自由身，你和你的随从骑过桥梁，横穿世界，把你的横标插在任何你想要的地方。你生于你母亲对兴奋的渴望，生在你父亲堡垒一般的房子里，有老屋子里的劲风充满你的肺，而没有它对你的束缚。一个高贵无瑕的君子，追逐他的自由意志，在革命的潮流中占有一席之地。”

科特安静下来，他的脚步声则显得更加沉重。

“芬，你在听我讲话吗？”

“是的，父亲。”

“过来。”

芬站起来。科特搂着芬的肩膀，同他一起在屋里踱步。

“我曾有好多的梦想，芬。我收获了很多自信，我的快乐已经支离破碎，但我还有你。我虽是个老人，但我的思想却不迟钝。我经历过海难，但我不惧怕大海。我相信生命，相信上帝。”

科特和芬无法步调一致地肩并肩走路，于是科特挪开了他搭在芬肩头的胳膊。芬又坐回到他的椅子里，听着他父亲继续说道：

“然后就到了你知道的这些时光，现在的日子，你长成为一个安静的人。你沉重地看着生活，胆小的你害怕世界上的硝烟火海。你的衣服总是一尘不染，但这很容易做到，因为你从来不打架。你从不会在别人不希望你出现的地方出现。你从不踏出家门，芬，从不。你的血液中没有热血，你的思想中没有欲望。你总是很累，芬，仅仅是累。我渐渐为你担心起来，随着时间流逝，你对我来说已不仅仅只是儿子，不仅仅是我的血肉，你是人类链条上的一节，穿越年华，一直向前。你的生命比我的更加宝贵。因为你得挑起新的负担进入新的时代。记住，芬，我曾去过山顶，看过森林。这不再只是传承的问题，不再只是家族骄傲和家族忠诚的问题。你和我在这场战斗中结盟。我拿着眼前的地图，紧随战斗的脚步，像年迈的士兵，自己无法再征战疆场，但他还有他的儿子，他的族群，他的帝王，记住我是如何到达我所在的地方的。记住我失去了什么，我放弃了什么，我是如何全心全意为你付出的。我拥有你，芬，除了你，我还有什么？那时，我开始为你担忧，我倾尽所有培养你。我告诉你老屋子的故事，希望它会让你穿上戎装。我告诉你你父亲和母亲的命运，是为了让你明白人们如何努力去获得幸福。我把你送到外面的世界，让你开眼界，看看更加伟大、强壮的生命力，是为了让你成为一个男人。但我从不……从不给你套上任何限制。我从不利用我作为抚养者的角色要挟你。而你，你翻着画册，带着比以往更加苍白的脸色回到家里。老屋子只是一首漂亮的诗，它让你陷入更沉的梦里。而在外面的世界，身强力壮的男人遇到他们的妻子。当太阳西下时，他们真诚而开心地交谈。而你，整天坐在那里，一个人，双手倦怠无力。”

讲到这里，科特重重地拍了下芬的肩膀。芬抬起头看着科特，双眼模糊，嘴巴一直在颤抖。

“今天，芬，我把一切交给你来继承。从今天起，我把你当作成年人对待。别人无法强迫你。而且，也没有人愿意那样做。也没有人能对你生气。你没有情绪，始终都那个样子。今天，这一切都将成为过去。出去给自己买座房子，娶个老婆，跟她生一群孩子。记住，我们家族里虽然有人失败，但没有胆小怯懦之徒。”

“父亲，我理解你所说的，但我做不到你想让我做的。”

“你们这些胆小鬼总是理解一切，因为你们根本没有任何信仰。你们以为你们都那么亲切聪明。说你们宽容，那是因为你们根本不做决定，你们知道，真理无处可寻又处处都在。你们替一切愚蠢的想法辩护，你们永远都在盘算肚子里那点儿东西却从不行动，然后你们放走了杀人犯，让小偷逃之夭夭。上帝啊，帮帮这些可怜虫！那些最愚蠢、最无知的恶魔都比你们这些人更聪明、更和蔼！”

芬想说话，但科特做了个手势，不让他说话，“一个男人，不应能够理解一切。他必须选择、判断、拒绝。如果他不这么做，那世界上就不存在幸福，也就没有和平和忠诚。如果他无法恨，那么他也就无法爱。”

科特走到窗户前，向外望去。此刻，芬走到他身边，抓住他的手，哀求地望着他，“我做不到你想让我做的那样。”

科特抽回自己的手，站得离芬远了些，“你没有权利对我说那样的话，芬。我不听。因为我想要的，只不过是让你去生活。拿着我给你的财产，随你的意愿使用它。有一天，你会为你的儿子负责，现在，是我对你负责的时候。”

芬满脸悲伤地笑笑，说道：

“我永远都不会有儿子。”

科特没有听到芬说的话。他陷入了回忆的挣扎中。科特用手抹了一把脸，目视前方。他看到阿德尔海德，那一晚在老屋子里，说了跟芬刚才说的一模一样的话，绝望无力。“我做不到你想要的。”

科特坐下来，躺回到自己的椅子里。

过去的绝望再次向他袭来，他陷入巨大的疲惫中。他无法抵御那一句“我做不到你想要的”。

然后，他从椅子上跳了起来，双眼冒火地看着芬，“如果是你的母亲摧毁了你的意志，那你立刻离开她，恨她，抛弃她。”

“父亲，父亲！”

“恨她，她沉迷于她年轻时的毒害。跟你一样，她理解一切。对于她来说，没有渺小伟大，没有远近之分。她的意志已经消失，就跟你一样。她知道荣耀在哪里，但她够不到。她汲取这个时代的精髓，她也成了这个时代的人。她总是病怏怏的，病得快死了。”

他穿过屋子，没再说什么。

科特和芬两人脸色苍白，都渴望独处。他们彼此都不想再说什么。

芬并不是为了他母亲而感到生气。他脑子里只有一件事情，那就是他做不到科特希望他做的，而且他也无法平息科特心中的悲伤，也无法告诉科特，他有多么爱他。他渴望静静地坐着，在老屋子里，和他母亲一起。

“你生我的气吗，父亲？”

科特长久地看着芬，然后说：

“是的。”

当芬离开后，科特把脸埋在手中，默默地哭泣。





第二十二章


科特打扮成要出门的样子，急匆匆地穿过客厅。

阿德尔海德坐在那里写信。当科特走进来时，她抬头看了一眼，然后又继续写信。

“芬在哪里？”

“楼上吧，在他自己房间里。”阿德尔海德回答，眼睛并没有看科特。

科特站在窗户旁待了一会儿，然后他坐到椅子上，又站起来，走到阿德尔海德写信的书桌旁说：

“你今天跟他在一起吗？”

“没有。”

她合起笔记本，转了转她的椅子，她的脸隐藏在阴影下。

然后她说道：

“芬太孤独了。”

“是的。”

科特点点头，又说了声“是的”；然后低着头，站在那里，陷入沉思。

“这里太安静了。”阿德尔海德说，“你不开心，芬注意到了这点。汉斯也离开了。”

“是的，是的。”

阿德尔海德双臂交叉，沉默地坐在那里，眼睛看着脚尖。

“阿德尔海德，”科特站直了身体，“我们会让这房子充满欢笑，”他说，“我们，你，我，还有芬，明天去拜访一下我们的新老朋友。我们邀请有活力的年轻人来家里做客，邀请漂亮的女人和聪明的男人，让屋子充满灯光和音乐。”

阿德尔海德抬头看着他。他笑笑，然后把手放在她的肩头。

“好的。”阿德尔海德回答。

关于这样的安排，科特又继续讲了一阵，然后就急匆匆地出去了。

阿德尔海德长久地坐在那里，客厅里渐渐暗了下来。大门前的灯亮了起来，灯影在天花板上摇曳。壁炉里的火苗在堆积的灰烬下闷闷地燃烧。阿德尔海德所坐的位置没有被灯光照到，她身上的白色裙子反射着微微的光亮。

她想到科特的微笑。他那样跟她说话，就好像是他在要求办公室的某个人做一件为难的事一样。她想到芬，芬看着她时那奇怪的眼神就好像他们之间的母子关系改变了，而且他无法理解。

她想到她自己。她感到自己像秋天里树叶凋零的树，一棵一直认为自己常青美丽的树，直到现在，她却看到了自己的青春在风中摇摆。

日复一日，每时每刻，她都在重建老屋子的旧日辉煌。

她重建老屋子的神坛，用七道封印封住门。她把时间调回到以前，想象她抱着她的孩子坐在那里，嫉妒老玛丽给他脱衣服，唱歌哄他入睡。她又想象未来，开心地描画着芬带着他的妻子踏入老屋子，并将两人的名字写在黄色文件上的那一天。

阿德尔海德苦涩地笑笑。

她想到，她好像那个把天球仪放在老屋子的那个人，那个神志不清坐在那里一直摆弄那些星星到死的人。

但当黑夜降临时，她的想法总是殊途同归。

她想，如果现在让这房子充满欢乐，还有用吗？还是会在宴会结束后，潜伏在房子每个阴郁角落的黑暗都会迸发出来，逼得他们三个人以各自的方式隐藏起来，焦虑而孤独？

她不知道。但她经常会想到这些。然而，不论是在她的希望里、她的恐惧中还是在她的遗憾里，都没有任何激情存在。

阿德尔海德现在非常平静。





第二十三章


广场上那幢富丽堂皇的房子里再次灯火通明，喜气洋洋。

一时间门庭若市，仆人在铺着地毯的楼梯上跑上跑下。巨大的会客室成了灯和花的海洋，音乐此起彼伏，人们翩翩起舞。

那光鲜亮丽甚至超过往日，因为房子的主人变得比以往更加奢华。他的身影遍布整个房子，他亲自负责料理一切，他穿梭于客人之间，热情地招待他们。

科特房子里举行的宴会成了传说。一切富有美丽高贵聪明的人们都受到科特的邀请并前去赴约，他们甚至抱着感激感谢的态度。

男人们聚集在房子女主人的身旁，陶醉于她的白色礼服和她的银发。

那些在她年轻时对她崇敬万分，如今已是满头白发的人们目不转睛地望着她那依旧高挑的身形，眼睛重现火光。而那些年轻的人，当被老人告知她曾经比现在美丽一千倍时，竟无力勾画那样的画面。

被她眼睛看到的每一个男人都变成了她的追随者，她的眼神也被永久地刻在那些男人的脑海中。

现在，她的笑容拒人千里之外。

她的眼神更加深邃，但又好像什么都看不到一样。她红色的嘴唇不再像以前那样充满欢乐。而人们依旧觉得，如果能赢得她，那是莫大的幸福。但没人觉得那是能够做到的事情。

他们猜想着这些年发生在这房子里的一切，为何它关闭了这么久，又为何突然敞开大门，夜夜笙箫。

他们的猜测并没有任何恶意。

他们邀请她唱歌。当她坐在钢琴前，用她那大而奇特的眼睛环视整个屋子，她的老朋友回忆起她年轻时热情洋溢的歌声，让他们热血沸腾，让他们在欲望和爱慕中潸然泪下。

当她的歌声响起，年轻的人侧耳倾听，忘我地沉醉在她的嗓音里，那声音明亮清澈，宁静悠远：

那是如今地球上最狂野的激流，

（上帝给予我他那令人心安的恩惠）

花朵布满深邃沉默的灰色峡谷，

但却只有它们才能诉说，

是谁搅动起这波涛汹涌。



从未有船漂流至此，

从未有花开放在此，

从未有鸟儿从这里飞走，

从未有星光从天堂

照耀至它的黑暗中心。

它从眼睛涌出，带着痛苦

（上帝保护我免于一切灾难！）

当一个男人把自己的幸福，

像破布一样撕成两半，

从不曾是他自己命运的主宰。

一曲之后，屋子里短暂沉默，然后，人们蜂拥至钢琴旁，向她表达钦佩赞赏，邀请她再来一首。

阿德尔海德起立，她微笑着感谢她的客人，但她的眼神则越过眼前对她而言毫无意义的人群，看着屋子另一端站着跟别人讲话的科特，显然，科特没有注视她也没有听她唱歌。

但芬听过她的歌声，看到过她优雅、低微、痛苦的样子。

芬的眼睛一刻不离地紧随着阿德尔海德，奇怪的想法在他脑袋里涌现。他现在明白，这房子里究竟发生了什么。他知道阿德尔海德为什么最近很少去老屋子里找他。为什么她会沉默地坐着，陷入深深的沉思，为什么她的眼神闪烁怯懦，说话犹豫不决，双手毫无力气。

他感到，他与人类连接的最后一根线也断掉了。

芬失去了他的母亲，因为他追得太紧。现在，阿德尔海德来到芬的身边，实际上是为了找科特。若是现在芬主动去找阿德尔海德，像以往那样躺在她身边，把脸放在她手中，阿德尔海德会把芬扶起来，撵他去外面的世界过生活。

他有一种被背叛的感觉，但同时，他在心中和阿德尔海德一同哭泣。他看着他的父亲，觉得科特比阿德尔海德想象的男人得多。他看着他的母亲，产生了一种奇怪的既爱又轻视的感觉，就好像男人对向他们索要一文不值的东西的女人的感觉。

然后，芬不得不走进冲他微笑的人群。

他内心的孤独感如此强烈，以至于毫无困难地就跟客人们混在一起，显得无比愉快，开朗健谈。

他很开心在这些屋子里走来走去，如同他在别的地方那样，因为这里已经不再是他的家。他甚至还跟一些穿着时髦的先生女士说几句俏皮话，因为他不得不说话，因为他无法告诉任何人他内心的想法，因为没有人能对他说他想听的话。

女人们聚集在他的身旁，如同男人们聚集在阿德尔海德身旁那样。一圈圈白色的胳膊和热切明亮的眼睛围着这房子的继承人，他如此白皙，如此帅气。女人们对他说迷人的漂亮话，对他微笑，但他会毫不犹豫、毫无可惜地冲破围绕在他身边的人群。

男人们向他献上友谊，芬和他们握手、讲话，但转眼就忘记了他们的样子。科特总是能从他躲清闲的地方把他找出来，然后继续带着他回到人群中。芬朝他父亲微笑，跟在他身后，但依旧孤独。

芬看到且只能看到他自己。他抓住每一个在他脑海中涌现的想法，对其进行讨论，就如同这个想法是由别人想出来的一样。他品读每一种在他灵魂中出现的心情，好像这心情是他在书里读到的。

他爬到人们无法居住的高山之巅，人们要么将其踩在脚下，要么死在白色的冰霜里，因为那里没有声音、空气，没有白天，没有路。只有灯，永远只有灯。

但是，当科特的眼神落在他身上，不知道为什么，他所感到的孤独立刻烟消云散。

然后，他便知道他是谁，他在哪里，生活的痛苦正在侵蚀他的灵魂。因为他经常在他父亲的眼睛中看到那个永恒的、无望的、天真的问题。他意识到他早已忘记的事实——这房子之所以重新开门迎客，全部都是为了他。每一声奏响的音乐，每一朵开放的玫瑰，每一位漂亮的女人：他们都是他父亲的仆人，都在向他一遍遍传递着信息，人生的盛宴随时都能举行，只要他在餐桌旁落座，喝光他金色酒杯里的美酒。

然后芬想到他那内心平和、容貌美丽的母亲，她已从自己身边离去，投入到现实的生活中，而他对这样的生活却无动于衷。芬想，要是他们能静静地坐在一起聊会儿天该多好，听着广场上的喷泉发出汩汩的声音，还有老屋子里的物件发出的低声细语。

哦，那样不仅对他有好处，对阿德尔海德也有好处，芬心里想，甚至对科特都会有好处。

芬的想法最终化为对科特的爱，他看到科特在自己无望的斗争中拼死挣扎。他感到他的父亲像是战争中的英雄，他渴望自己是父亲身边卑微的仆人，能够为他征战疆场，为他抚平伤口，为他坚守睡榻，吹奏长笛。

然而，宴会如往常一样进行，当最后一辆马车驶出房子大门时，已是深夜。

大门关闭时发出沉重刺耳的声音，好像在怒气冲冲地驱逐客人。大门的链条嘎吱嘎吱地响着，好像它再也不会打开，决意要把外面的世界永远地关在那老房子外面。而房子里愈来愈多的阴霾聚集，那是无论多少灯光或多少欢乐的号角都驱逐不走的。

然后，他们三人在一起坐了一会儿，这三个老房子的常居者，坐在一起说着空洞的话，睁着无神的眼睛。

阿德尔海德第一个停了下来，因为她的想法是最强烈的。芬说得最多，好似在弥补之前的过错。

但科特是最痛苦的。冷漠的言语在这亲密的三人中传递，他们害怕沉默，但彼此之间又无话可说。

然后，科特和芬相继道了晚安。阿德尔海德让仆人退下，自己一个人待在客厅，伴随着燃尽的蜡烛。

她不安地在房间里走来走去，回忆逝去再也无法返回的时光。她欣然地沉浸在自己的幻想里，因为现在的她只有一个希望，一个信仰，一次忏悔。

她幻想着宾朋满座的愉快夜晚结束时，科特和她眼神交融，而只有他们俩才能懂得那眼神的意义。

然后她走进婴儿房看看她那睡得小脸红扑扑的儿子。之后，她会拿一枝最红艳的花朵，爬上那段隐秘的楼梯，走向光辉满堂的老屋子。

科特已经在那里坐着，等待着她。

她进门的时候看到科特，科特向她点点头，然后又回到自己的沉思中。她在窗户旁安静地站了一会儿，那里红色的鲜花在她双脚前绽放，楼下广场上一片漆黑，只有喷泉的汩汩声有规则地响着，没有开始亦不会有结束。

然后她穿过屋子，听到科特在对她讲话，永远都是那一些，对跳舞的偏见，对伟大婚姻的赞美，还有充满激情、富有爱意的祷告。让那些无所事事的人继续跳舞，她坐在科特示意的那把古董椅子里，就在他旁边，这是一个庄严的位置，坐在上面的人显得渺小但坚强，因为他们的脚踩在一个由信仰搭建保护的神坛上。

壁炉里火苗跳跃，蜡烛在角落里发着微光，科特站在壁炉旁说话。她会在窗户那里站一会儿，屋子里一片寂静，她看着科特，这是她生命里的男人，一直都是。然后，她会走向科特，缓慢地，轻轻地，因为她尊重她脚下的大地。然后她跪在科特坐着的地方，用那双迷人的、科特曾经爱过的眼睛望着他。

然后她会告诉他，她对他的爱是怎样的，是怎样强烈又怎样沉静，“科特，你这个坚强不可战胜的男人，我爱你，而你应该这样被爱。我感谢你，因为你陪我聊天从不感到厌烦。因为你总是恳求我。因为你等待我，且相信老屋子里的沉默终有一天会变成愉快的歌声，其他的一切声音会像树林里遥远的嗡嗡声那般。如今，我在这里，科特，你这个坚强不可战胜的男人。现在我是属于你的，如同以前一样，在老屋子里，我是你的。老屋子里那些过去留下来的物件没什么可让人郁闷或害怕的。我能对着老钢琴唱歌，这样就不会有琴键突然断裂，不会有回忆被惊扰，因为我只唱有关你、有关我们的孩子和我的快乐的歌曲。我能珍爱曾祖母留下来的老纺车，因为我已在自己的房间里编织我的幸福。我能爱意满满地把蜡制娃娃藏到窗帘后面，因为我爱这老屋子，能够长久而满足地待在里面。但那个画着在荆棘中扭动的裸体男人的罐子，我在还不成熟的时候把它放在那里。它将纪念阿德尔海德的灵魂所经历的那段黑暗时光，那段欲望被广场上的声音吸引的时光。我们的儿子，睡觉的时候小脸红扑扑的，有一天他将有男人魁梧的身材，在你和我去世之后，也将来到这里，和他的妻子一起坐在我们曾经坐过的地方。他会知道，他的母亲曾受到欲望的引诱，但并没有被摧毁。”

阿德尔海德坐在角落里，在空无一人的房间里想象这一切。

她白色的礼服在地板上铺开。她的眼睛闪着光芒。




而在楼上，芬站在老屋子的阳台上，盯着远处的夜晚，夜如同漆黑无浪的海一样在他周围延伸。

好静。他没有思考，没有幻想。他的灵魂和黑暗交融，既不邪恶也不美好……只是悄无声息。

他像一个被放在高楼边缘巡逻的死人一样，静静地站在那里，目无神采。喷泉咕咚咕咚，就好像水从池盆的边缘升起，一直到那死人站立的地方，为了把他冲走。

此刻，广场上有一个行人在走路。

那人边走边唱，直到看到阳台上的芬，耸立在黑暗中一动不动。那人停了下来，看着芬，喊了几句。

阳台上的芬朝着那人喊了一声。那人害怕极了，跑了起来，迅速消失在黑暗中。





第二十四章


科特看着阿德尔海德所在的房间问道：

“芬在哪里？”

“我想他应该在老屋子里。”

科特关上房间门，迅速下了楼梯。阿德尔海德坐在窗户旁，看着下面的广场，科特站在那里，抬头望着这房子。然后，他走远了，从他走路的方式阿德尔海德就知道，科特并没有什么事情要去办。

仆人点燃房间里的蜡烛。阿德尔海德坐在壁炉旁，手放在膝盖上，听着静得出奇的房子里发出的每一个声响。

不久，科特返回家里。

阿德尔海德听到他在走廊上说话的声音。

然后他走进自己的房间，又走了出来。她知道，科特要去找芬。但一扭头，科特走进她所在的房间，和她隔着一段距离坐下来，“你今天去见他了吗，阿德尔海德？”

“没有。”

科特在他的椅子上不安地动来动去，站起来又坐下。阿德尔海德挣扎着要不要走到科特面前，握住他的手跟他讲讲话。此刻，科特说道：

“芬最近很奇怪。比平常开朗，但心不在焉。虽然他没有假装什么，但他也不是他自己。”

科特接着讲芬的事情，没有看阿德尔海德一眼，他讲这些不是为了讲给阿德尔海德听，而是他没有办法保持沉默。阿德尔海德看清楚了这一切，转过脸，悄悄地哭了起来。此刻，科特问道：

“你注意到这一点了吗？”

“我觉得他跟平常一样。”

科特站起来，穿过房间。他在壁炉旁站了一会儿，盯着壁炉里的火苗。阿德尔海德抬头看着科特，眼含泪水。然后科特又走回到他原先坐的地方，说道：

“我在想，阿德尔海德，你是不是该上去看看他？”

科特听不到阿德尔海德的回答，于是朝她看了一眼。此刻，阿德尔海德站了起来，正在朝他走来。科特看得出阿德尔海德脸色十分苍白，知道她在哭泣，但并没有太在意。

阿德尔海德在科特身边坐下来，她离科特那么近，她的礼服遮住了科特的脚。她双手合十放在腿上，然后又把手分开，低着头说道：

“科特。”

当她喊他的名字时，阿德尔海德开始颤抖，不得不双手握紧。

“嗯？”

“你应该上楼看看他，科特。”

科特沉默了一会儿，然后低声说道，就好像房间里还有其他人，而他不希望其他人听到他要讲的话，“我不敢。我已经让他害怕了。他会站在我房间门外，等到鼓足勇气才进屋和我道早安。我打算远离他一阵子，可能去旅行，直到他内心平静下来。”

阿德尔海德看着科特，想象着他在外面四处晃悠，为了能让芬恢复宁静。她想象着科特在遥远的城镇漫步，一个人，内心无法平静，牵挂着他的儿子。既渴望早日回家和他团聚，又害怕看到他不好的样子。

阿德尔海德坐在科特面前的地板上，把脸放在他手掌里，眼泪顺着脸颊慢慢流下。

科特没有看到阿德尔海德的眼泪。他目视前方，眼神紧张又充满痛苦，“他不喜欢我们的聚会，阿德尔海德，我们这么做，对他有害无益。”

“是的。”

“但，如果你上楼去找他，阿德尔海德，悄悄地，陪他坐一会儿，让他说说他的想法。你们两个总是相处得很好，你知道的，每当你去找他，他总是很开心。”

“现在他见到我已经不再开心了，科特。”

科特惊奇地看向阿德尔海德，看到了她泪光闪闪的眼睛。

“如果我现在上去，科特，我无法像以前那样陪他坐着。因为我跟以前不一样了。”

“唉，好吧！”

科特说得平静冷漠，好似原本他就对这个解救芬的办法也没有抱太大的希望，必须再去找其他的方法。

“科特！”

阿德尔海德尖叫道。

科特吓了一跳。然后，就好像他刚刚看到阿德尔海德跪在他面前一样，他往后推了推椅子，站了起来。

科特穿过房间又走了回来，站在阿德尔海德身旁看着她，眼神中的嫌恶每一分钟都增加一分。阿德尔海德爬到科特刚才所坐的椅子那里，把头放在椅子上。她闭上眼睛，静静地抽泣。

“你？”科特缓慢地说道。

阿德尔海德像被这个词打击到一样，无法呼吸，她睁开眼又立刻闭上，脸色苍白，一动不动地躺在了科特的脚下。

科特眼里充满怒气和嘲笑，“自从我们相识，都这么多年了，阿德尔海德，这是多么痛苦难熬的岁月啊！”

“没错。”阿德尔海德抬起头，然后又靠在椅子上。

“你离开，追寻你充满激情的幸福。你不满足于你爱着的且深爱你的丈夫，你必须让所有的男人都拜倒在你的脚下，你必须看到他们眼中的欲望之火燃烧，看到他们那不洁的手抽搐，因为他们不敢触碰科特的妻子。”

“是的。”阿德尔海德说道。

“那么，你找到让你心甘情愿的情人了吗？当他看穿你那双迷人的眼睛，他是不是一脚把你踢开了？或者，你选择离开他，去寻找你那更有激情的爱人？”

“我没有情人。”阿德尔海德低声说道。

科特将额头的头发甩到脑后，握紧了拳头说：

“是的，你没有。那是你的耻辱和你的审判。”

“科特，科特，假如我有……”

“是，如果你有情人，且他现在就在这里，那我应该握着你的手，把你带到我们儿子的面前，告诉他，‘这是你的母亲，她一直都不幸福。她爱过你的父亲，但当她遇到这个对她意义更大的男人的时候，她对你父亲的爱就死去了。这么多年她都没有过一天开心，因为她的命太硬。现在她又回来了，渴望你的喜爱并且需要它。’”

科特穿过房间又走回来，“站起来，阿德尔海德。”

阿德尔海德从地板上站起来，坐在她的椅子里，她洁白的双手交叉放在腿上，沉默无语。科特看着她，好似阿德尔海德谦卑的遵从更加激怒了他，“当你结束你的婚姻时你去哪儿了？是老屋子的空气对你来说太纯洁太强大了吗？自那以后你都去哪儿了？”

“我去上帝那里了。”

科特大声笑道：

“给我看看你的上帝。”

科特俯下身去看着阿德尔海德的脸，说道：

“我不相信你的上帝。”

阿德尔海德看着科特的眼睛，伸出她哆嗦的双手，她红色的嘴唇颤抖着说道：

“那么，我也不相信他，科特。”

科特转过身。阿德尔海德静静地低下头，她的眼泪滴在她的手上，她聆听着科特暴风雨般的话语，且渴望更多。

科特坐在窗户旁，看着窗外的倾盆大雨，路灯的光辉在风雨中闪烁。此刻，科特的怒气已经消逝。他已经不记得他们刚才一直在谈论什么。他脑子里一直在想芬，其他的什么也没想。

突然，他站了起来，双手按着太阳穴，看着阿德尔海德，眼中充满恐惧地说道：

“阿德尔海德，你觉得芬今天晚上会不会不下来跟我们道晚安？”

阿德尔海德知道，一切都已经晚了，无可挽回地晚了。阿德尔海德无法告诉科特她灵魂深处的煎熬。科特永远都不会知道，她无法回到他身边是因为她太疲惫，因为她害怕，但她诚恳地改正她生命中堕落的时光，如今又以科特会喜欢的样子站在科特面前。

“他会来跟我们道晚安的。”阿德尔海德平静地说。

阿德尔海德双手合十放在嘴边。

她可以等，如果能让她在科特的家里找到一个她可以停留的地方，即便要求她赤脚穿过石子地也无妨，她想，那里总会有一条路通向科特。




夜色深了。

阿德尔海德坐在科特身旁，握住科特的手，科特没有反对，这让阿德尔海德开心不已。她想把科特的头发从他那满是皱纹的额头上拨开，想把手放在科特那疲惫的眼睛上，但却不敢。

他们讨论着芬的事情，阿德尔海德像个孩子那样温柔地对科特讲话，愿意顺着科特。阿德尔海德的话语变得那么温柔，让人印象深刻，她脸上又有了笑容。阿德尔海德扭头看看科特，看到科特的脸上闪现的笑容，就像从乌云深处透出来的一束阳光，转眼就消失了。

科特几乎没有听到阿德尔海德在讲什么，但她说话的声音让科特安静下来。阿德尔海德柔柔的嗓音，窗外的细雨声，让科特感到温暖平静。

那每时每刻都驱使笼罩着他的每一滴想法的恐惧，在这安静的一小时里，变得麻木。他坐在那里，像个经历太多痛苦的老人一样，好似他的身体机能都麻木了。

科特看着阿德尔海德，像年轻时郁郁寡欢的他看着母亲一样。在他眼里，他母亲好似一个小女孩，对他的父亲知之甚少，且对他没有任何亏欠，但母亲会亲自把玫瑰花送到父亲手上，这样家里的气氛就变得令人愉快一些。

科特又一次在椅子里很不自在地挪了挪身体，神情异常地看着阿德尔海德说：

“阿德尔海德，为什么我除了他再没有其他的孩子？”

科特平静地说道，顿了一会儿，又重复了一次，而这次，他不是说给阿德尔海德听，而是他自己。阿德尔海德啜泣起来，因为她知道科特没有在看她。




夜色笼罩大地。

他们安静地坐着。然后阿德尔海德说：

“科特，让我们一起上去找他吧！”

“我们两个？”

阿德尔海德焦躁地等待科特会不会继续说些什么，会不会突然反应过来她是谁，然后狠狠地将她推开。

但科特并没有这样做，他沉默地坐在椅子上，眼睛盯着壁炉里的红色火焰。

然后阿德尔海德站起来，向科特伸出手，“走吧，走吧，让我们赶紧走。我们跟他一起聊会儿天，平静地，愉快地，直到那些阴影消失。然后我们就下楼来，那些阴影会再次笼罩他。但我们每天都去陪他一会儿，和那些阴影斗争，直到他好起来。”

科特沉重地站起来，握住了她的手。

阿德尔海德像带着孩子一样带着科特在房子里穿行。他们穿过长长的走廊，走上那段隐秘的台阶，阿德尔海德在科特前面一点儿。她的眼睛充满了欢乐。她灵魂深处的钟声响起，她紧紧地握着科特的手，再也不愿松开。

两人来到老屋子门前，敲了敲门，静静地听屋内的动静。阿德尔海德看着科特，又俯身吻了科特的手，她双眼满含泪水。

然后，阿德尔海德轻快地推开门，拉着科特昂首挺胸地走进屋里。

窗户旁坐着科特的儿子，在其中一把大椅子上。他用枪结束了自己的生命。

PREFACE　TO THE FIRST (ANONYMOUS) DANISH EDITION


I who write this book am still young and fair to look upon and rich and very sad.

My youth and my beauty fill me with horror and I know not what to do with the wealth which I possess. Daily my sorrow sings the same song in my ears. It rustles in the folds of my train; it sighs in the fragrant flowers at my breast. Through the long nights I sit on the edge of my bed thrusting away the dream that comes with glaring eyes.

Now what I have written is a lie.

When I wrote it, it was the truth: now, it is a lie. When I saw it set down on paper, I knew that my youth was my strength and my right; that, if I were ugly, I could not live; and that, if I were poor, I should die.

And now I am glad; and there is nothing on earth but my gladness.

I am in this case.

But I let the words stand as I wrote them, for I know that the time will come—and that soon—when all of them will be true again…until they once more become a lie.

And so my book will grow, through still and stormy times, until the day comes when I am again what I now am.

But that, too, is itself a lie. For I was always the same.

But there came a moment at which HE saw me as I am; and there my book will end. For after that there was but little that differed from the stories in other books and less still that I remember.

Be that as it may, it is true that the world contains a room in which the radiant light of happiness famed up before my eyes. And the light went out and the door closed upon me.

And, if any one, from what I have here written, comes to think me a great and abject sinner, then he is indeed right. But, if he thinks that I have been cast off by the world, then he is at fault.

For I go with head erect and peacefully along the road that others go; and I am welcome among the best. The lights in the high hall stream down upon my hair; the men honour me with their desire, the women with their ill-will.

Their lives only one who knows my guilt and he has condemned me.

For it was HE that stayed in the room where the light burns. And she that went out into the street was I.





PART I　CORDT





Chapter 1


The room looks out upon the square, which is so big and so fashionable that there is no business done in it.

By day there is a sound of carriages, but at a distance; for the house that contains the room is thrust a long way back and its walls are as thick as the walls of a castle. In the evening, the square shines with a thousand lights; at night, you can hear the rippling of the fountain, which never begins and never stops, cries, no one knowing what they are, and solitary steps that approach and retreat again.

The room is built high over the square. Its window is a door and leads to a balcony flled with red fowers. When the wind lashes them, their petals fly right over into the basin of the fountain and rock upon the water.

The room is long and deep.

Where the window is, the light streams in through the wide, stained-glass panes; but, inside, where the fire-place rises to the ceiling, it is always dark.

No one has ever seen the curtain drawn before the window. But, even if the sun could shine right into the room, it would never have seen a human being there. By day, the room is dead.

It is placed so strangely in the house that it seems to form no part of it. The life of every day passes outside it; and, even when the whole house is lighted up and the horses paw the ground in thegateway and glasses clink and music sounds in the great drawing-room, the door of the room remains constantly closed.

No one has ever crossed its threshold but the master of the house and his wife and the oldest servant in their employ.

For the room is the soul of the house and its tradition and its secret chamber.

It was destined for this purpose long ago by the man who built the house; and so cunningly did he contrive it that no one could guess that it was there, unless he knew of it. Then, when the work was ended, he sealed the architect's tongue with a solemn oath and a heavy fee and the man kept his sworn word.

And the builder of the house decorated the room as richly as was possible according to the means of those days, with gilt and fgured leather hangings and stained-glass window-panes and costly carpets from the East. But he placed no furniture in it until the very last. Then he brought two splendid armchairs which he had had made for him in Milan.

They were odd-looking chairs. They glided so smoothly over the foor that a child could move them, and were so large that people became quite small when they sat in them. Their wood-work was carved into birds and animals, whose faces grinned strangely in the dark but ceased to do so when the lights were lit.

When everything was thus ordered for the best, he called an old servant, who had been in the house since he was a child, gave him a key of the room and told him to care for it faithfully. Every evening, when it grew dusk, he was to light the candles on the mantelpiece and he was to do this even if he knew that his master was travelling in distant lands. Every morning, he was to adjust the room with hisown hands. None but himself was ever to cross the threshold.

On the evening of the day when he took possession of his house, the master, having first shown her all its other beauties, brought his wife to the room.

She looked round in wonder. But he made her sit in one of the great chairs, seated himself in the other and spoke to her in these words:

“Sweetheart, this room is for you and me and for none other in the world. I have placed it in the most secluded part of the house, far from the counting-house, where we work, from the passages, along which our servants go, and from the drawing-room, where we receive our guests, ay, even from our marriage-bed, where you will sleep by my side.”

She took his hand and kissed it and looked at him.

“It shall be the temple of our marriage, hallowed by our love, which is greater than anything that we know. Here we will pray to Him who gave us to each other. Here we will talk gladly and earnestly every evening when our hearts impel us to. And, when we come to die, our son shall bring his wife here and they shall do as we did.”

Thereupon he wrote down in a document how all this had happened and they both sealed it with their names. He hid the document in a secret recess in the wall. And, when all this was accomplished, they fell upon their knees and, folding their hands together, offered a simple prayer to God before they went to rest.

These two are long since dead. But their son complied with their will and his son after him and so on and so forth until the present day.

And, however riches might increase or diminish with the varying fortunes of the times, the old house in the square continued in the possession of the family. For he who was its head always lived in such a way that he kept his ancestral home.

The room stood untouched, as was appointed, and the document grew old and yellow in the secret recess in the wall. Once only in the time of each master of the house was it taken out; and that was on the evening when he first brought his young wife to the secret chamber. Then they wrote their names upon it and put it away again.

But it became the custom for each of them that took lawful possession of the room to adorn it with a piece of furniture after his own taste and heart. And they were strange objects that, in the course of time, gathered round the two great, strange chairs.

There was one of the owners of the house who was kindly and cheerful to the end. He placed in the room, in his wife's honor, a costly spinning-wheel, richly inlaid, which whirred merrily every evening for many a good year and which stood as it was, with thread upon the spindle.

There was one whose thoughts were always roaming and never at rest and whose intellect was obscured before he died. He presented the room with an ingenious representation of the heavenly system. When a spring was pressed, the spheres lit up and ran their eternal courses; and he sat and played with the stars to his last day.

There was another whose wife dreaded the deep silence of the room and never entered it but once. He waited for five years and then had a doll made, a woman, life-size and beautifully dressed. He put it on a chair in the window, so that the light fell on its vacant face. But his son, who loved his mother, drew the doll back, so thatit was hidden in the curtain.

There was one whose wife was in the habit of singing when she was sad, as she often was. She brought a spinet, with slender, beautiful notes, which sang like a mother singing her child to sleep. In time, its sound grew very thin. When it was played upon in the room at night, it sounded over the silent square like a humming in the air; and none that passed knew what it was.

There was also one who had his wife's portrait painted and hung the picture on the wall. He broke his wedding-vows and his grandson took the picture down. But, where it had been, a light stain remained that could not be removed.

The man who was master of the house at the time when that happened which is related in this book had brought nothing as yet. But his wife had set up a thing that had caught her eye more than all that she had seen in the way of art on her long travels. This was a jar of a preposterous shape, large and bright and of a pale tint. On one side was the fgure of a naked man writhing through thorns. It stood on a stone pedestal hewn from a rock near Jerusalem.

That was how the room was.

Each evening, when it grew dark, the oldest servant in the house lit the candles on the mantel-piece. Each morning, before any one was awake, he cleaned the room with his own hands and watered the red flowers on the balcony. When winter came, he strewed bread-crumbs for the sparrows that gathered on the baluster and twittered.

But the name of him that owned the house was Cordt. And his wife was Fru Adelheid.





Chapter 2


Cordt sat in one of the arm-chairs by the chimney, reading.

He was in evening clothes and held his crush-hat and his gloves on his knees. He turned the pages quickly. Every moment, he swept his thick hair from his forehead; every moment, he looked at Fru Adelheid, who was walking up and down the foor with her hands behind her back.

She was very tall and slender. Her face was as white as her white gown. Her mouth was very red, her eyes looked large and strange. She wore fowers in her hair and at her waist.

“You are not reading, Cordt,”she said; but she passed with her back to him.

He closed the book and laid it aside. Then he moved the chair so as to turn his face towards her. His eyes were larger than hers and steadier, his mouth frmer.

“How beautiful you are!”he said.

She laughed softly and took his hand and kissed it:

“How charming of you!”she said.

She began to walk again. He stretched out his legs and lay with his head back in the chair, but followed her all the time with his eyes. Now and again, she stopped, smoothed her gown, let her fingers stray over the keys of the spinet and then went out on the balcony through the open door. He could not see her from where hewas sitting, but the white train of her dress lay inside the room and he looked at that.

Then she returned, sat on the arm of the other chair and swung her foot to and fro.

“I do not like you to be in good spirits, Adelheid,”he said.

Her eyes shone. She looked at the fireplace, where a log lay glowing:

“You should drink a glass of wine, Cordt.”

“I do not care for wine.”

“No more do I. But I like its exhilaration. It makes one so light-hearted. Then everything becomes so charming.”

“Have you been drinking?”

“But, Cordt…what makes you ask that?”

“Because you are so light-hearted and I so charming.”

She went up to him and laid her cheek against his hair:

“Now don't spoil it for me,”she said.“You can, with a single word, and that would be a great, great sin. You say I am pretty; and I am glad because you think so and because I am going out with you and because you are handsome and belong to me. We shall be far from each other and close together for all that. We shall nod to each other, as we always do, and know what we know.”

He released himself from her gently:

“Sit down a little,”he said,“and talk to me.”

She kissed him and sat down in the chair and then and there forgot her despondency. Her eyes shone as before. He raked out the embers and threw a log upon them. They sat and watched it catch fre and saw the smoke surround it and rise up. Her foot tapped the carpet; he shaded his eyes with his hand and pursued his thoughts:

“In my frst year at the university,”he said,“there were fve of us who were chums and we used to meet every Saturday evening. It was generally at my rooms, for I could best afford it. We used to sit and drink wine until bright daylight and then take one another home.”

“You must have drunk a great deal.”

“I don't know. Perhaps we did. We talked so loud and deep. The wine made us feel bigger, braver and cleverer. Next day, we were quite different, more reserved and cool. But we could look one another boldly in the face, for we had nothing to repent of. It did not matter if we had allowed ourselves to be carried away. We knew one another so well and trusted one another.”

She sat and looked at him as he spoke, but said nothing. Lost in thought, he continued to throw logs on the fre until she took one out of his hand and put it aside:

“You'll set the house on fre!”

“One should never drink wine with strangers,”he said.“You see, it is so degrading to be stripped bare. And that is just what happens.”

“You say that as if it meant getting drunk.”

He paid no attention to her words, but went on:

“One unbuttons one's self, one reveals one's self. Look at your eyes and your smile. I have felt it in my own eyes: hundreds of times, I have suddenly seen them all naked together round the table.”

“In good company, Cordt?”

“Where else?”

“I don't understand that,”she said.“I do not know the people whom you speak of.”

“You will be with them this evening, Adelheid.”

She shrugged her shoulders discontentedly and tapped her foot on the carpet.

“Adelheid.”

She looked at him and her eyes were dark and angry. He took her hand and held it fast in his:

“I have seen it in eyes that were looking at you, Adelheid.”

She drew her hand away:

“This is hideous, Cordt!”

She rose and went to the balcony-door. He looked after her and his eyes gleamed:

“Adelheid.”

She stood with her back to him, leaning against the window-frame, and buttoned her gloves. He leant forward and gripped the arms of his chair with his hands:

“I have seen it in your eyes, Adelheid.”

She did not move, uttered not a word. When she had fnished buttoning her gloves, she gathered up her train and went out on the balcony.

The May air was cold and she shivered in her thin gown. The lamps shone dimly through the mist; many carriages drove across the square. She could hear the tinkling of the harness-bells in the gateway; the footman was tramping up and down below.

She turned and stood at the window and looked at Cordt. He had moved his chair round towards the fireplace. She could see nothing of him but one shoulder and arm, his thick hair and his legs.

“The carriage is there,”she said.

He rose and went to her.

“You must not be angry with me,”he said, gently.“I am out of sorts.”

“Are you ill?”

“Yes…perhaps.…No, not that.”

“Well, for all that I care, we can stay at home. You have spoilt my pleasure.”

“Have I?”

“Of course you have. It was for you I made myself look so nice…it was with you I wanted to go out.”

“Was it?”

He took her hand and drew her to the fre:

“Sit down, Adelheid…there…only for a minute. Shall we stay at home to-night…get some wine…have a party of our own…?”

“Yes…you're in such a festive mood!”

“Now be good, Adelheid. You are my only dissipation…You know you are…there have been hundreds of delightful days to prove it. If you are of my mind to-night, we will do this. And you will be beautiful for me and I for you and our eyes will sparkle together.”

She did not look at him, but shook her head:

“I will stay at home, if you wish it,”she said.

They sat silent. The candles on the mantelpiece flickered and guttered in the draught.

“It is strange,”he said.“Do you remember the evening in London, Adelheid, when we were to go to that great ball? Then I begged you to stay at home and you did and you were glad.”

She lay far back in her chair, with her arms behind her neck:

“I was not glad that evening,”she said.

He raised his head and listened.

“I submitted, Cordt, but I was not glad to. I was acting a part, for your sake.”

She met his eyes. Hers were still and sad and she did not remove them while she spoke:

“I was wicked, Cordt. I hated you. I told you a lie. I was dancing at the ball, hour after hour, while I sat and held your hand and laughed so gaily.”

She slipped from her chair and crouched before him, with her hands folded round his knee and her eyes fxed humbly on his face:

“Do not look at me so strangely, Cordt. That is how I am. I love you. But I cannot live without the others…without having them to see it, to see my happiness. I want to be pretty and I want them to fall in love with me and I want to belong to you. I only care to be pretty if I am loved. Don't look like that, Cordt.”

She clung to him with eyes of entreaty.

“I am not really wicked, Cordt…am I? I was with our little baby day and night when he was ill…wasn't I, Cordt?”

“Yes,”he said.

“Yes…I was. But I cannot always be quiet.”

He lifted her from her chair and crossed the room with his arm round her waist. They went out on the balcony. A carriage came across the square at a brisk trot, followed soon after by a multitude of others. They came from the streets all round, but drove away in the same direction and disappeared round a street corner. The horses' hoofs clattered against the pavement, the lamps shone on the glittering carriages, coachmen and footmen sat stiff and black on their boxes.

“Come, Adelheid,”he said.“Let us go.”




The candles on the mantelpiece burnt down and the faces in the big chairs grinned in the darkness. When day dawned, the old servant came and arranged the room. When it was evening, he lit the candles.

He did this the next day and the next and many days after. The sun rose and the sun set. The water splashed in the fountain. The lamps shone and the people swarmed over the square. The balcony was bright with its red flowers and, every evening, the light fell through the open door.

But the summer passed and no one entered the room.





Chapter 3


Fru Adelheid stood on the balcony. She plucked the red fowers and threw them into the square below. She wore a long, white gown; her gloves and her white boa lay on the ground. She had just come from the theatre and had been bored.

Now she turned towards the room.

Cordt sat huddled together before the fireplace and stared in front of him. She wanted to see his face and called to him. He pushed back his chair and looked up:

“I was thinking of the play we have been to see,”he said.

“Yes, it was stupid.”

She drew the other chair over the foor, so that she could look at the jar with the naked man writhing through thorns.

“There was a time when I was tired of law,”said Cordt.“I was glad when the poet showed me a marriage that was broken for love. I used to think that people grew greater through it and that Heaven seemed higher and earth more green.”

She shuddered again and wrapped her skirt closer about her feet.

“Now I am so tired of lawlessness. I loathe these women and their lovers.”

“You are married yourself now,”she answered.

“What do you say?”

He looked up. She could see that he had not caught her words and she was glad.

“There must be a struggle, no doubt,”she said.

“Of course there must. There is. In the old days, they were not allowed to come together and now they are not allowed to stay together.”

She said nothing, but let her hand glide over the jar.

“All these faithless wives have lowered love. I could imagine a woman of refnement stifing her love, because she would not give it scope.”

“Because she was afraid.”

“Because she was refned.”

They sat silent for a time and looked at the live embers in the white ashes.

“Do you think there are many who do that?”

He looked up.

“Do you think there are many faithless wives?”

“I don't know. Why shouldn't there be?”

He leant his head on his hands. Fru Adelheid played with the jar.

“But I can't understand that people care to go to the theatre.”

“Where would you have them go?”

He pushed back his chair so that he could see her. She remained sitting as she sat and thought of nothing.

“Adelheid,”he said,“I suppose you wouldn't care to stay at home to-night?”

She lay back in her chair and looked at her hands.

“Oh,”she said,“I wanted to go out to supper.”

“I should so much like to talk to you.”

“But I did come home from the theatre, dear,”she replied and put out her hand to him.

He did not see it and she let it fall.

“I would rather have stayed at home after the theatre, Adelheid.”

“Yes, I see,”she answered and just shrugged her shoulders.“I did not understand.”

“But you understood it in the theatre. And now you want to sup out all the same.”

He bent over to her to catch her eyes. She said nothing and did not look at him.

“Adelheid.”

Fru Adelheid knit her brow:

“I don't go to the theatre, you see, for the sake of the play,”she said.“That does not amuse me. But it amuses me to watch that sea of people and to hear them clamor and then fall silent. I like the way they clap and the way they are quite still when anything good is being said on the stage. Then something sings inside me and I enjoy it.”

He looked at her for a moment; then he laughed and rubbed his hands. Fru Adelheid turned her chair towards him, so close that her knees touched his:

“What is it that you wanted to talk to me about this evening?”she asked.“That couldn't be postponed until the theatre was over? That couldn't wait for an hour, now that I feel like going out to supper?”

He looked at her and shook his head.

“Was it anything? Or were you only tired and empty, as I was…and as the faithless wives are…and the modern poets and…and everybody?”

“No, Adelheid,”he said.“No. It was nothing. Nothing at all.”

“I don't know what you mean,”she said and suddenly flung herself violently back in her chair.“There is something behind your words.”

Cordt nodded.

“You are angry with me. What is it that I do? We live no differently, that I know of, from other people in our circle. We travel, we go to the theatre, we go out and we receive our friends at home. We meet amusing people, artists…everybody who is anybody.”

“Are you always amused among amusing people?”

She looked at him a little doubtfully:

“There is no such thing as always anywhere.”

“No,”he said,“more's the pity. There is not.”

They sat silent, both steeped in thought. Then he pushed his hair from his forehead and said, calmly:

“Try if you can understand me, Adelheid. When a woman marries and becomes a mother, she usually becomes quiet…quieter, I mean. I mean that there are victories which she cannot win, triumphs which she cannot achieve…which she does not trouble about. She does not trouble about them, Adelheid, because she has deepened her life…because she has come so near to one man that the approach of other men is distasteful to her. Then she becomes quiet…quieter. And this quietness is not empty, but just richer than all the rest.”

She looked at him with a strangely inquisitive fash in her angry eyes:

“Are you jealous?”she asked.

He shook his head and made a gesture of denial with his hand. But she sprang from her chair and stood before him with great, proud eyes:

“You ought to be, Cordt,”she said.“You ought to be. I am yours and I love you. You won me once: see to it that you know how to keep me. Fight for me, Cordt. I am young, I am pretty and the world is full of men.”

He rose deliberately and looked at her till she thought for a moment that he would strike her.

“You will be twenty-six next month,”he said.“And, besides, we in our family don't fght to keep our wives.”

“Cordt.”

She sat down without knowing what she was doing. He looked at her and she looked back at him. She could not help thinking how tall he was; and how easily he wore his clothes; and that one of his shoulders was a little lower than the other.

Then he crossed the room, so quickly that he nearly tripped over the carpet. He struggled with the old spinning-wheel and pulled it over the foor. She followed him with her eyes.

“Can you spin on my great-grandmother's wheel, Adelheid?”he asked.

She crossed her arms on her breast and looked at him.

“Can't you, Adelheid? Couldn't you learn? Not if I begged you to?”

He pulled the spinning-wheel right in front of her and placed it as if she were to use it then and there. Then he sat down in his chair again.

“Don't you think you could, Adelheid?”

They looked hard at each other. Then they became timid and shy and dropped their eyes.

They both thought of holding out their hands, but neither could see the other's. They longed to throw themselves into each other's arms, but they sat as stiff as statues. Their lips trembled; but they did not look at each other and neither knew anything of the other's thought.

“I am thinking how very small we look in these big chairs,”he said, at last.

His voice was calm and she grew quite calm at once. It was all over; there was peace in their souls. It was not a reconciliation, for they remembered no quarrel. Their glances rested confdently upon each other.

There was nothing between them and they were friends.

“I wonder if we are inferior to those who sat here before us,”she said.“Different, yes; but inferior?”

They both rose.

“Much inferior,”said Cordt,“and much less happy.”

They crossed the room and went out on the balcony, as was their custom before they went to bed.

The stars of the September night rode in a high sky. Most of the lamps were extinguished and there were but few people in the square. A drunken man was singing far away. The sound of the water falling in the fountain swelled up in the silence.

“How beautiful it is here!”he said.

“Yes.”

“And now the summer nights are over and we have not enjoyedthem.”

She laid her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes.

“I do not think that in the whole world there is a square so pretty as this,”he said.

“Oh, yes…in Florence…”

He sighed and led her into the room:

“We have travelled too much, Adelheid.”

She crossed the foor quickly and opened the door. He remained standing on the balcony.

It had all seethed up in him again. He fought against it, but to no purpose.

“Are you coming, Cordt?”

She was outside in the passage and could not see him.

“Do you go…I will come presently.”

He forced his voice to be as calm as possible, but it sounded very unnatural in his own ears. He stood quite still and listened. She remained standing for a moment, as though she were considering.

Then she closed the door and went. He could hear that she went hurriedly.





Chapter 4


The frst snow had fallen and lay fne and white on the balcony, embroidered by the feet of the sparrows.

The red flowers stood indoors, in the warmth, and looked pitiful. And a big table had been placed at the back of the room, with a lamp upon it and a pile of books.

Cordt came early.

He went straight up to the table, sat down and opened a book. Soon after, he stood at the window and looked out.

It was growing dusk. A damp and misty evening, with a thin, reddish light behind the mist and cold feet and dripping roofs. The snow on the square had melted into slush. The fountain was silent, covered with boards and pine-faggots.

He sat down again and read. He stood up, looked at his watch, went to the window, walked up and down the floor and sat down again. He lit a cigar and let it go out. He went away and came back in an hour and began all over again.

A little before midnight, the carriage drove in through the gateway and, fve minutes later, Fru Adelheid stood in the room, tall and white, with large eyes.

“Have you enjoyed yourself, Adelheid?”

She could hear that he did not care to know and she did not answer:

“I am freezing,”she said.

She drew her chair close up to the fre, nestled into it and put her feet on the fender.

“They asked after you, Cordt.”

“I daresay.”

He turned over the leaves of his book a little, then closed it and drew his chair beside hers. He sat resting his cheek in his hand and looked tired.

“Do you intend to sit in this room all day, Cordt?”

“No, only in the evening. When I have nothing else to do, I love this room.”

She pressed her hands hard together and closed her eyes.

“I hate it,”she said.“All the unkindness that has come between you and me comes from here.”

He said nothing to this, but rose and went to the table for a cigar. Something went through her as he slammed the lid of the box.

“Are you going with me to-morrow?”

He shook his head.

“Do you want to cut off all our acquaintance, Cordt?”

“No,”he said.“I do not. But I don't care to go out just now.”

“What do you think our friends will say?”

“Let them say what they like.”

“Don't you consider how unpleasant it is for me?”

“Oh, yes. But I don't care to go out at present.”

He lit his cigar at the candle on the mantel-shelf. Then he sat down again and smoked quietly and looked into the fre. She looked at him and sighed.

And, without knowing how it happened and without intendingit, she suddenly felt her heart touched and her eyes grew moist:

“Are you not happy, Cordt?”

He looked up and gazed at her:

“No.”

“And it is my fault? Because your wife is a silly woman, who wants to go out every day?”

“You are not that, Adelheid.”

“Because I am an empty, restless, modern creature?”

“You are not that.”

“What am I then, Cordt?”

He took her hand and kissed it and smiled to her:

“You are my wife, Adelheid. And we have a little baby, we two, and perhaps will have another.”

“No,”she said and drew her hand away.“No, Cordt. That was only my nonsense.”

He said nothing. His hand fell down slackly and he turned paler than she could remember ever having seen him. She was afraid that he was ill and stooped over him and called to him.

He did not see her, did not hear her.

She could not take her eyes from him. She thought he could not look more distressed if their boy were dead. She felt it as an appalling shame, that she herself was glad of it; and she dreaded lest he should look at her.

Then he did and read her thoughts.

And she grew worse and worse the more she saw him grieve. She did not understand it, felt troubled by it.

And, as there was no anger in his eyes, it grew worse for her still. She cast about for a word that could make him move and saysomething, no matter what.

But he sat still and silent and slowly turned his face away from her. And she could fnd nothing to say.

She rose and went to the window and stood there for a while. Then she came back and sat down in a chair:

“What are you thinking of, Cordt?”

“Of you.”

Again they sat silent.

“Adelheid.”

He spoke her name quite calmly and gently, but she was frightened.

“I will fght for you, Adelheid; I mean to fght for you; and the new little baby would have helped me. Now I shall have to fight alone.”

She remembered vaguely that this phrase had once been uttered between them, but she did not understand him.

“I will stake life and happiness to win you,”he said.“I will talk to you and importune you and conquer you. I will take you in my arms and close my door against you and run after you and forgive you.”

“And, if you don't win me?”

“I shall win you.”

“But if?”

She looked at his mouth, while she listened for the answer. It came quite calmly; he did not even look at her:

“Then I shall cast you off.”

Fru Adelheid closed her eyes tightly and then opened them wide:

“Better cast me off at once, Cordt. If you can.”

“I can't. We have the baby. And we are fond of each other.”

“I don't know,”she said.

“What don't you know ?”

She did not answer, only shook her head.

“You shall have your liberty,”he said.“Go out as much as you please, amuse yourself, fll the house with guests. Be gay and melancholy the whole day long, as your fate decides. Go away, if you feel inclined.”

“And will you never go with me?”

“As little as possible. I will not fght for you out there. I won you there once and I am not afraid for you…that way. There, in any case, I need not trouble to win you again.”

“And then?”

“Then you will know that you can find me here any evening. Here is where I shall live.”

He rose and walked slowly through the room. Fru Adelheid let herself slip to the foor and lay there with her cheek on the fender and stared before her. She saw him return and stand beside her and go and come back again.

“Cordt,”she said,“I shall never come here.”

“You can do about that as you please.”

He sat down and rested his head on his hand:

“My ancestor well knew what he was doing, when he built this sacred nuptial secret chamber in his rich, new house…high above the street, far from the day's work…and the night's. He saw deep and far.”

“It is the torture-chamber of the house,”said Fru Adelheid.“Iam certain that many women have wept bitterly in here.”

He half rose in his seat and passed his hand over his forehead.

“I am frightened, Cordt. You want to ill-use me. I can't do what you wish. Shall we talk somewhere else…in your room, Cordt?”

“No,”he said.“Our place is here. Here we are bound to be.”

He stood up and sat down again at once. His eyes glittered as he spoke:

“Here they all sat, the men who lived in the house and their wives…in joy and in sorrow. Their faces look at us from every corner, their words whisper all around…. Can you not hear my great-grandmother's spinning-wheel?…Do you not hear the spinet singing?”

“Yes, Cordt.”

“Here our words become greater and weightier in the stillness. Here we grow more powerful in our affection and our anger. Whatever we can do we can do here. They knew something, those old, big men and women.”

She rose and stood before him, leaning against the mantel, tall and white:

“They knew how to keep discipline in their house,”she said.

She looked at him and there was pride and fear and anger about her red mouth and in her strange eyes.

“That they did,”he said.“God bless them for it in their graves!”

She sat down in the old chair and put her arms around the jar, where the man writhed through thorns. She stared at the man's face and it was as though she were with him and felt the thorns in her fesh.

“Here also it was that we two bound ourselves to each other forgood and all, Adelheid. That evening when we put our names to the old yellow paper there, in the wall. Then you pledged yourself to this room, which you hate. And, when the time comes, our son will come here with the woman who shall be his joy.”

He went out on the balcony and came back, white and wet with snow. He brought the cold in with him and she shivered. He stood silent by the fre and then began to walk about again. She listened to his step and waited for a word and could fnd nothing to say.

Then she went to the old spinet and sat down and sang:

My Lenore, how dark and drear

The burden of daylight's bringing!

No music of chiming hours I hear,

No birds in the sunlight singing.



Sweet Lenore, O lady mine,

Bright-eyed, as the day wanes weaker,

Now pledge me deep in the golden wine

Night pours from her fragrant beaker.



The violets watch us, blue in the plain,

Not a star our secret misses.

Kiss me, Lenore, and kiss me again

And give me a thousand kisses.

The slender tones sang through the room, when she stopped.

She listened, but could not hear his footstep. He was sitting in one of the big chairs and did not move.

She looked at him for a moment over her shoulder. Then she rose and closed the instrument, with as much noise as she could:

“Good-night, Cordt.”

“Good-night.”

Then she turned very red and very pale and went away with moist and angry eyes.





Chapter 5


Fru Adelheid was icy cold and had drawn her chair as near the chimney as she could.

It blazed and fared in there; the red glow scorched her face and her white gown. But she kept on adding logs to the fre and could not get warm.

Cordt sat in the other chair reading, with his book on his knees and his head leaning on his hands. The book was a large one, with yellow pages and old-fashioned characters.

Fru Adelheid looked at him despondently. She regretted that she had come up to the room and would have gone away, had she had the strength to. She sighed and looked into the fre with tired eyes.

“Adelheid…listen.”

He pushed his hair with both hands from his forehead and read:

But, when the tidings came to Queen Thyre that Olav Trygvasson was dead, she fell into a swoon and lay thus for long. And, when, at the last, she came to herself again, she was so sorrowful that it was pity for those of her house to behold. When the day was over, she went to a monk who dwelled near by and was known in all that land for a holy man. Him she asked if folk who died by their own hands sinned against God's law; since her lord and husband was dead and she had no more liking for life. But the monk answered and said:

“Indeed it is a sin. For God has given us life and will take it back again when He thinks right.”

Then the queen wept, because she must sin so grievously. But, early the next morning, she came again and asked the holy man how little one was allowed to eat without angering God. And the monk took pity on her and said:

“If you eat an apple every day, that will be enough.”

Then Queen Thyre lay down on her couch and bade all her handmaidens leave her, so that she might be alone with her dule and sorrow, bidding them that one of her maidens, whom she best loved, was to bring her each morning an apple in the golden cup from which she was wont to take her morning draught. And so it fell that, when the maiden came on the morning of the ninth day with the apple in the golden cup, the queen was in Heaven with her husband.

He closed the book; his lips moved as though he were repeating the words to himself. Fru Adelheid looked thoughtfully into the fre. Then she said:

“It was all very well for those old, dead people. They always had a holy man to whom they could go in their distress.”

But Cordt shook his head.

“You distort the chronicle, Adelheid,”he said.“It was not at all like that. The queen wanted to die and she died. She went to themonk to be released from sin and piously subjected herself to his command.”

“They had God, in those days,”said Fru Adelheid.

“Yes, they had. The old, strong God held them in His hands.”

He rose quickly and stood by the chimney.

“Do you believe in God, Cordt?”

“No,”he answered.“I do not. But I believe that He once existed. And I think that it would be a good thing if He were here now.”

“I think so too.”

He put his foot on the fender and folded his hands over his knee:

“God is somewhere still. And I do not fear His mighty face. If ever I come to look upon it, then I daresay I shall see all that was high and glorious for me in my days, all that made my blood red and my back straight.”

Fru Adelheid smiled:

“Is that the old, strong God, I wonder?”

He glanced at her face, but there was nothing there to rouse his anger. Then he crossed the room and stood beside her again with the same expression in his eyes:

“The old, strong God,”he said.“I myself can do well enough without Him. But I need Him in my house.”

She laid her head back in her chair and laughed:

“Yes, indeed, Cordt. That you certainly do.”

And she kept on laughing and said again:

“Then I daresay that wouldn't have happened with…what was his name, who robbed you down below, in the counting-house? Doyou think so, Cordt? And then your wife would kiss your hand every morning and ask to know her stern lord's commands.”

He walked up and down and did not answer.

Fru Adelheid understood that he paid no attention to her sally, because her words were too small for his thoughts and she was displeased with herself and angry with him:

“But, to come back to the story, surely there are also Hagbarth and Signe,”she said.“Not to speak of Romeo and Juliet. And Maria Veczera…and Elvira Madigan.”

Cordt continued his walk.

“I don't say anything against it. It is a beautiful story. And perhaps it is true besides. In any case, it is right to place a good example before the young. But, as for as Queen Thyre, it surely depends a little upon how long she had been Fru Trygvasson.”

He did not so much as look at her. She felt that she was being treated as a child whom one does not trouble to answer and she worked herself up into a steadily increasing passion and sought for words to wound him:

“Every love passes,”she said.“That we know. It is all very well for those who die frst. They show up prettily in history; but there is nothing to prove that they were better than the rest of us.”

Cordt was still walking. Now he stood over by the window and looked out. Then he began to walk again.

“Cordt.”

He stopped before her chair and looked at her.

“Do you know how long King Olav and Queen Thyre were married?”

“What is the point of all this, Adelheid?”

She pushed back her chair and stood up. She was not able to say at once what she wished, but took a step towards him and sat down again and felt quite powerless.

Then there was something in his glance that helped her. And she drew herself up and looked him frmly in the face:

“It means that you are sitting here and growing musty in old books and old stuff and nonsense, while life is taking its course around you. In time, your beard will grow fast to the table and you will never speak a word, except once every ten years, and then it will be so wise and deep that no one will understand it.”

“There is no danger of that, Adelheid,”he said.

“But I don't want to be Queen Thyre or Signe or any of them,”she said; and her voice was so hard that something gave a wrench inside him.“I want to be the woman I am, the woman you fell in love with and took in your arms. I am not in a book. They will never read about me in the girls' schools. I have no time to spare for this endless old drab affection beyond the grave. I don't understand it, I don't believe in it. I want the wild, red love…”

Cordt had turned his face from her, while she was speaking. Now he looked at her again:

“Haven't you got it, Adelheid?”

She lay back in her chair and gave him a strange look. He had never seen those eyes before. Veil after veil fell over them, till they were quite dark, and then there suddenly lighted in them a gleam that was gone at the same moment and the veils fell again.

“I do not know,”she said.

She said it so softly that he could only just hear. He listened a moment whether she would say any more.

Then he bowed his head, so that his thick hair fell over his forehead, and threw it back again and turned very pale:

“Indeed?”he said.

He slowly crossed the room to the window and stood with his forehead against the panes. And slowly Fru Adelheid turned her face to him and back again to the fre.

It did not seem to her as though she had said it; and then, the next moment, she heard his quiet answer and saw his face, which was so terribly stern and white. She knew that it was not what she meant to say and she knew that it was true. She felt a bitter remorse at having hurt the man she loved, a senseless despair at not being able to make amends.

Then all this was dissolved in anger that he had led her on to speak like that. And the anger died away in a profound, soft pity for herself.

She saw deeper into her own soul than she had ever done before and turned dizzy with what she saw. She was seized with a wild and curious longing and bent lower over the well. Then it seemed to her as though she were falling and she gripped the arms of the chair so tightly that her knuckles turned white.

And behind the terror was the distant bird, that sang…a green and golden land, which she had never seen in her dreams…

Cordt stood before her and put out his hand:

“Good-night, Adelheid,”he said.

She sat straight up and looked at him in bewilderment:

“Are you going?”she asked.

“No. But I should like you to go to bed. I shall stay here a little longer and read.”

He sat down and took his book. Fru Adelheid rose slowly and went across the room.

At the door, she stood for a moment and looked at him. His face was very still. It seemed to her as though he were far away. She wondered whether he would look up and say good-night once more. Or only nod.

But he was reading and turning the pages of his book.





Chapter 6


The fre in the hearth was nearly out and the candles had burnt quite low. It was quiet in the room and quiet outside.

Cordt sat in his chair. He had been sitting there long and had not stirred, only pondered, with his fingers buried in his hair, and listened for Fru Adelheid's footsteps.

She was at home, had been at home the whole week. But she had not set foot in the room for the last fortnight.

Cordt looked at his watch. Then he rose and left the room, left the house.




A little later, Fru Adelheid came.

She remained standing at the door, surprised to fnd the room empty. She called to the balcony, but no one answered. Lingeringly, she went to the window and looked out. There was no one there.

She turned quickly to go. Then the thought came to her of what it had cost her to come up here; and she was annoyed that Cordt was not there. But that was only for a moment; then she was happy again at escaping the encounter. She felt in a lighter mood than she had for many days.

She looked about her curiously. She had never been alone in the room and she seemed not to have seen it properly before.

She stood long in front of the old chairs, lost in contemplationof the strange faces in the woodwork. She pushed them round the foor, placed them opposite each other and beside each other and sat down in them as though to try what it was like. She summoned up in her memory all that she knew about those who had sat in them and amused herself with imagining what one had said and the other.

Then she went to the celestial globe and looked at it. She pressed the spring, so that the stars ran and shone. She looked with delight at the queer plaything and, when the clockwork stopped, set it in motion again.

She pulled out the old spinning-wheel and sat down beside it and set it going. The wheel whirred lustily in the silent room and its whirring put Fru Adelheid in a very cheerful mood. She wished the great-grandmother would come in at the door and praise her for being so industrious.

She rose from the spinning-wheel and stood in the middle of the room and looked round. She thought of an occasion when she had stood in an Indian temple and refected that she was examining these singular old things just as calmly as she had contemplated the Hindu sanctuary.

It seemed to her as though she were standing in a mortuary chapel, where old and interesting, but foolish ideas and preposterous superstitions stared at her from the sunken faces of mummies. She felt no terror, for she knew that all that was dead and gone and could never return.

Her eyes fell on the light stain on the wall, where the portrait had hung.

“Poor Fru Lykke!”she said, aloud.“You were shut out of the temple, because your husband deceived you.”

And she lifted her arms in the air in jubilant gladness that she was born in gentler times and still lived and felt the warm blood beating in her heart.

Fru Adelheid went round the room and laughed aloud to think how easily she had broken the spell of the old room. She patted the big chairs on their stiff backs and talked kindly to them. She used to hate them; her blood had turned to ice each time she sat in them. Now they were two handsome, valuable chairs and nothing more.

She had torn the veil from the Holy of Holies. There was nothing behind it. She ran to the window and pulled the curtain aside with a jerk.

There sat the doll…stiff and stupid.

She laid her face on its waxen cheek and kissed it with her red mouth.

Humming a tune, she sat down to the old spinet. She sought for a hymn that should celebrate her victory over the ghost.

But, when she struck the first notes, she suddenly grew frightened.

She had an uncomfortable feeling that there was some one in the room.

She sprang up, so that the chair upset, and looked around her.

There was no one.

The candles were all burnt out but one and it was dark in every corner. Now the last candle flickered up and struggled a little and went out.

And then there came a treacherous and threatening muttering and whispering all round the room.

People passed over the foor…many and heavy footsteps. Thespinning-wheel whirred, the spinet sang behind her back. The stars ran and shone, the doll rocked at her. The faces in the old chairs raised themselves on their long necks and pecked at her and grinned uncannily.

But the man who writhed through thorns called for help…She could hear him call. He grew bigger…he came nearer…She saw the blood drip from his naked limbs…

Fru Adelheid crept to the door with quivering hands and fearful eyes.





Chapter 7


Fru Adelheid laid her hands over Cordt's book:

“May I talk to you a little? May I tell you something? May I tell you that what you are doing is madness?”

He moved her hands from his book and looked up:

“Sit down, Adelheid,”he said wearily.“Sit down in that chair.”

But she took the book from him and threw it on the foor:

“You are ill, Cordt. You have become ill up here in this dreadful room.”

“Have you a household remedy?”he asked.

“How can you have the heart to make a jest of it?”

“It would be a bitter jest, if it were one,”he said.“But it was not a jest. I believe in the old household remedies.”

Fru Adelheid sat down in her chair and stared helplessly before her:

“Of course you do,”she said.“And in old books and in everything that has ceased to exist.”

He said nothing, but yawned wearily.

“And God shall be set on His throne again and I shall sit at the spinning-wheel and we shall enjoy a blessed married life and be happy ever after.”

Cordt crossed his legs and looked at his nails:

“Yes…that is my programme,”he said quietly.“Something likethat. And you have stated it in your usual affectionate manner.”

“Cordt, how can you have the heart?”

She swung her body to and fro; her hands lay folded in her lap, her eyes were moist. She wanted to say something, but could not, because the tears prevented her. She could not understand that he did not help her. Then she said:

“Things are going badly with us, Cordt.”

And, as he was still silent, she pulled herself together with an effort and spoke with closed eyes, constantly rocking to and fro:

“We must obey the law under which we were born…must we not, Cordt? After all, we are modern people…both of us. Tired, empty people, if you like. But we do think and feel otherwise than people did when…when they were the sort of people whom you like. And we cannot alter ourselves. But we can be as happy as it is possible to be…nowadays, being what we are. Why should we not be happy, Cordt ?”

“I am not happy.”

“Oh, Cordt!”

She pressed her hands together and wrung them and bent over them so that her tears fell upon them. Then she turned her wet face to him and asked, softly:

“Then am I no longer pretty, Cordt?”

He stood up and kissed her white forehead:

“That you are,”he said.“But that won't help us any longer.”

He began to walk up and down. Fru Adelheid wept hard and silently. A little later, she said:

“You are driving me away from you, Cordt. I do so want to tell you this, while there is still time, if only I could fnd the right words.Won't you sit down a little, Cordt? My head aches so.”

He sat down in the chair. Then she rose and put some wood on the fre and sat down again:

“I am so afraid of myself when we talk together, Cordt,”she said.“It is not only that I am wicked and say what I do not mean. I do that, too. But you are so good. And you show me thoughts in my mind which are not there before you utter them. But then they come and I think that you are right and that they have been there always. That is so terrible, Cordt.”

They sat silent. Fru Adelheid closed her eyes; Cordt moved restlessly in his chair:

“Adelheid,”he said…“You told me that evening…”

“You must not say that…you must not.”

“Do you remember, you said…about the wild, red love…that it was not the love which you have?”

She shook his hand and pressed it:

“That is just it,”she said.“I am grateful to you because you were so good. And because you did not take it ill. But that was not in me, Cordt. I did not know it. But then you said it…and made me say…what I said. But then, at that very moment, I understood that it was so. And that made me feel so terribly bad…as I did. But then I felt a sort of secret joy…a secret treasure. It seemed to me that I was richer than before. I was no longer afraid of what may come…for women sometimes think of that, Cordt, while they are young, how empty everything will be, when that is past.”

He listened, with his face turned to the fre.

“I am sure that there is not a man who can understand that,”she said.

And then she lay down on the floor, with her chin on the fender…and her eyes shone:

“A woman is young for so short a time,”she said.“And she is always dreading that it will pass. Can't you understand, when she suddenly suspects that there is something greater than the greatest…and then, when she is sad and afraid…that then it may suddenly dawn upon her that all is not over yet?”

Cordt laughed:

“It is a poor pleasure to be the greatest when there is something greater still,”he said.

But Fru Adelheid shook her head:

“It's not like that, Cordt,”she said.

He pushed back his chair and walked up and down many times and it was silent in the room. Then he sat down again beside her and said:

“What you say is true. But it was in you and I am glad I showed it to you. I could not do differently, when I once saw it. I cannot go and wait until another man knocks at the secret door of your heart and offers you the greatest of all.”

She laid her cheek against the fender and looked at him:

“No, Cordt,”she said.“If it is like that, then what I said was not true.”

He waved his hand and shook his head impatiently:

“Not to-day or to-morrow,”he said.“But in a year, or two years, or ten. And, if it does not happen, then it is only an accident.”

Then she moved nearer to him and laid her head on his knee. She looked up to see if he minded. But he was far away in his thoughts and did not notice it.

She suddenly felt peaceful and contented. She was glad that she had got it said. She felt as if it was removed to a distance…perhaps it was quite gone…she could not understand why he continued to speak of it.

And what he said about another man seemed so far to her and so impossible. She thought about it as though it concerned somebody else:

“I love you, Cordt,”she said.“And, if, one day, another man came and I loved him…could I help it?”

He sprang up so suddenly that she had to seize the arm of the chair lest she should fall:

“No,”he said, scornfully.“You could not.”

He rushed through the room and repeated his words three or four times. Fru Adelheid rose from the floor and sat down in her chair and closed her eyes.

“The man who hit upon that excuse did a fne day's work,”said Cordt.“He drove out of the world a great portion of men's strength to live their lives.”

He threw himself so violently into his chair that Fru Adelheid started. Then he sat long quiet and she was glad that he was silent.

“Why should one not be able to control one's heart?”he said, at last.“Suppose I have a wife and child; and my wife is she whom I myself chose. Then, one day, I meet another woman, who rouses my desires. I meet her at a party, where there are lights and wine and music…we are not ourselves, she and I…we are in another mood than usual…everything is done to lead us from the way by which we go on ordinary days. But why should I not be able to step aside, in loyal gratitude for that which I possess?”

She opened her eyes at intervals and closed them again. She heard what he said, but did not realize that he was speaking to her.

“Who is it that placed love outside the laws? If I take it into my head to kill a fellow-creature, there is no doubt but that I am indulging a most criminal fancy. If I have given my word and think of breaking it, I am no gentleman. But my heart may do as it pleases.”

“Yes,”said Fru Adelheid.

She was thinking of nothing when she spoke and he did not hear her.

“There are people, we know, who have the right to send thousands to their death,”he said.“There are people whose passion rises skywards in red fames and devours the poor chattels that stand in its way and lights up all the land. Poets sing about it and a wax taper burns before its image in every human heart. But, if a man plays the Napoleon in the Store Bröndstræde, we hang him…Why should every second woman be entitled to look upon herself as an Héloïse?”

He sank into his chair and stared before him:

“I am not sure either whether the radiance of the one great fame makes up for the thousand tiny lights that are put out. Does any one know, I wonder? Can any one measure it?”

Fru Adelheid moved and Cordt turned his face to her and looked at her attentively. Her eyes were soft and dreamy; she smiled faintly, like a drowsy child.

“And if that be so,”he said, in a subdued voice,“if it be the case that I am not able to control my heart…”He let his head fall heavily on the arm of the chair.“If it be the case that love makes mehappy and confdent, so that I build my life and the life of my family upon it…if it can then expire, without my knowing how or why, and I have to look for the mother of my children in a strange man's bed, then why do I let my wife go out in the street unveiled? Why do I not lock her up, as the Turk does? Or why do we not kill the mother when the child is born?”

He rose and walked round the room and grew calmer as he walked:

“But it is not so,”he said.“Let the great keep their greatness…let the poets celebrate them and the puny moderns ape them in their wretched way. And may there always be women who cannot give themselves more than once and men who love them.”

He stood by the fre and looked through the room. It was still on every side; the church-clock struck two.

“See, Adelheid,”he said,“how life passes more and more into law's domain. Every day, the liberty of the one is taken for an encroachment upon the rights of the other. Every day, land, hitherto free of law, is regulated by law. Flowers beget no fowers without the gardener's consent; animals no longer select their own mates. But no one can control his heart; and human beings pair like dogs in the street.”

The fre had burnt out when Cordt woke from his musings.

He saw that Fru Adelheid was asleep. He stood before her a long time, sick with compassion for her and for himself.

Then he stroked her gently on the hair:

“It is late…Adelheid.”





Chapter 8


“I could wish we were not married, Cordt,”said Fru Adelheid.

She laid her arms across her breast and looked at him with deep, dark eyes:

“I could wish I were your mistress. If it meant that, all would be over and done with in the morning. Then there would be no more of this unpleasantness. And no fear, either. And the joys we have would be all the fairer.”

He stood by the fre and played with the keys in his pocket.

“Then your forehead would be smooth and your eyes bright, Cordt, for then you would be making love to me.”

He looked up and said gently:

“Don't I make love to you, Adelheid?”

She sighed and said nothing. Cordt sat down in his chair and time passed. Then he asked:

“Do you hear what I say, Adelheid?”

“I am longing to hear what you will say next.”

“I read something similar to what you have been saying in a book lately,”he said.“I forget what the book was called. I was looking into it…just where the author railed against marriage, with its security and its habits and all that. I have read exactly the same thing in a hundred books, I think.”

“Yes…they all sing the same song,”she replied.“It is notparticularly entertaining. But it is true enough, I daresay.”

Cordt struck his hands together lightly:

“It is curious how little imagination the poets have nowadays,”he said.“One would think there were only half a dozen women, whom they have all kissed and married and run away from. I wonder that it never occurs to one of them to glorify custom.”

Cordt pulled his chair forward and sat with his head in his hands and looked into the fre:

“If I were a poet, I would sing a song in honour of sacred custom,”he said.

“Would you, Cordt?”

“Yes, yes…that I would.”

He laid his head back and listened to the gale whistling in the chimney:

“Now just look, Adelheid, at two people thrown into each other's arms by the strongest power on earth. For them there exists neither day nor night, neither time nor place. The whole earth is fragrant with violets. Their joy is terror and their terror is full of exultant gladness. Then a child lies in her lap and the light in her eyes is deeper than before. And then the years go by…there are fewer violets on the earth as the years go by, Adelheid. She bears her children in pain. And the pain sears her cheek. The children have sucked her breast dry; her eyes are weary with the night-watches. The stranger who passes the house sees only the faded woman. But he who drank intoxication from her young eyes and kissed the strength of her bosom…he does not see it. He has grown accustomed to that woman. She has quenched the longing of his youth and given him peaceful happiness instead.”

He was silent for a while. Then he turned his face towards her:

“He does not live in his frst eager longing for the trysting-hour, but confdently seeks his accustomed couch by her side. Custom has gently bound the two people into one family. Is that not beautiful, Adelheid? And good?”

“Yes,”she said.“It is beautiful, as you tell it. But it is not youth.”

“Then what is youth, Adelheid?”

“Youth is not rest.”

“Then one should not marry before one is old,”said Cordt.“For marriage is rest. Deep, powerful, happy…generating rest.”

“No more one should,”replied Fru Adelheid.“And that is why I could wish I were your mistress.”

She looked at him, as she said this, and he at her.

Then he stood up and laid his hand on the back of her chair and bent close down to her:

“How far estranged from each other we have become!”he said.

And Fru Adelheid nodded sadly and Cordt crossed the room and stood by the fre again:

“In vain I pitch my call in every key,”he said.“It has availed me nothing that my ancestor built this room…his heirs have borne witness here, generation after generation, to no purpose.”

A gust of wind came and blew the balcony-door open.

Fru Adelheid shuddered and looked that way, while Cordt went and closed it. Then he remained standing by the celestial globe and pressed the spring:

“I so often think of the poor man who placed this toy up here,”he said.“He was a man who could not be content with the circlein which he moved. So he lost his reason and devoted himself to playing with the stars…For us modern people it is different…the other way round. We go mad because the circle in which we move is too large. We leave the stars to the babies. We play ball with bigger things. We try a fall with God Himself, if the fancy takes us…provided that we have not outgrown that plaything too! We dare not speak of love and we smile at marriage. We despise courage and do not believe in honesty and each of us has his own opinion about virtue.”

She heard what he said even as people listen to music when it does not so very much matter if they catch every note.

“Then it happens that we long for a fxed point in our lives…just one point. Something that cannot be pulled to pieces and discussed. And something that is not past.”

Cordt sat and moved about in his chair and could not settle down:

“If I were to put anything in this room,”he said,“it would be a little tiny house…from far away in the country. There would be only one door and two windows and it would be evening and the smoke would rise up gently from the chimney. The house would have to be as small as could be; but that would show that there was no room for doubt inside it. Husband and wife would go in and out of the door to the end of their days.”

Now she heard what he said and looked at him.

“That is what my marriage ought to be, Adelheid. If I had had any talent, I daresay it would have been different. Or if I had to work for my bread…And I am no different from other men of today…no stronger, no braver. I know nothing about God and I have noexcessive belief in men.”

He had lowered his voice and spoke without looking at her. But she understood that he was listening for a word from her and her heart wept because she had nothing to say to him.

“My fxed point,”he said.

Then he was silent for a little. But, soon after, he rose and stood with his arm on the back of her chair and spoke again:

“There was also something in what I used to see at home. Father and mother were so kind…and so strong. I see them before me now, as they used to kiss each other after dinner, however numerous the company might be. And they kissed each other good-morning and good-night until they died. And when father and his brother met in the street, they always kissed…people used to laugh…and it was such a pretty habit.”

While he spoke, she sought for an opportunity to interrupt him.

“My family-feeling has always been too strong,”he said.“Until now. And yet…I once had a sweetheart…”

He stopped. Fru Adelheid sat up and looked at him. Her eyes shone.

“Or a connection, if you like…”

“You never told me about that!”she said.

Cordt raised his head and looked at her and she lowered her eyes.

“There is nothing to tell,”he said.

Then he said no more, but went to the window and stood there.

And Fru Adelheid again felt small and ill at ease in the big old chair.





Chapter 9


Cordt stood on the threshold and waited, but then closed the door and went to the fre.

He was in dress-clothes and tired and pale and his eyes were bright with wine. When he had been sitting for a little while, it grew too warm for him and he drew his chair to the balcony-door. There he sat and let his hands play with the red fowers.

Fru Adelheid did not see him when she entered.

She moved slowly and stopped in the middle of the room, when she discovered that he was not by the freplace. She was surprised at this, but soon forgot it, in her gaiety and her lingering excitement at the evening's entertainment, with her mind full of bright and clever phrases and the lights gleaming in her great eyes.

She sat down to the spinet and laid her forehead against the keys. Something was singing inside her; her foot softly beat the carpet.

Then she sought among the music and sang:

Lenore, my heart is wrung.

Thine is so dauntless, thine is so young.

Tell me, Lenore, the truth confessing

(Which never were mine by guessing):

Whence do thy soul's fresh fountains pour?

Where the mountains dip or the valleys soar?

Tell me, the truth confessing;

Open to me youth's door.



Lenore, my heart is sad.

Thine is so constant, thine is so glad.

Teach me thine equable gait to borrow;

Teach me laughter and sorrow.

My heart is a desert, sterile and bare;

My heart is thine: do thou whisper there

Of a fount that shall flood to-morrow,

Of a sun that shall gild God's air.

She put one hand on the music-sheet and played with the other and hummed the tune again.

Then Cordt clapped his hands in applause. She started and her hand fell heavily on the key-board:

“How you frightened me, Cordt!”

He came and stood beside the spinet. Fru Adelheid looked at his face and sighed. Then she stood up, put the music away and went and sat in a chair by the freplace:

“Won't you come here, Cordt?”

Cordt walked to and fro again and up and down.

“Sit down here for a little,”she said.

“Why should I?”he asked.“You are not here, you know.”

She looked up and met his calm eyes.

“You are still down below, among the crowd of our guests. Don't you know that, Adelheid? They are all empty carriages thatdrove out at the gate. For, as each one came to shake hands and say good-bye, you entreated him to stay a little longer.”

Fru Adelheid sighed and crossed her hands in her lap. He stood up by the freplace so that he could see her face.

“I was sitting over there among the fowers, when you came in, and I saw it all. You entered with a gleam and a rustle, accompanied by the whole throng…you were the fairest of them all. By your side went Martens, supple and handsome. A long way after came his wife…the woman who wears those tired eyes and that painful smile. She did not even look to see to whom he was offering his homage.”

She puckered her forehead and looked at him angrily.

“Then he begged you to sing the song once more and they crowded round you and added their entreaties to his. You crossed the foor…with your slow, sure gait…You always walk in the same way, Adelheid…like one who is not to be stopped. Your white dress trailed behind you; there was silence in the room.”

Cordt ceased for a moment. Fru Adelheid laid her head back in the chair and closed her eyes.

“Then you sang…his song…the one you were singing a minute ago at the old spinet…Yes, you heard me applauding, Adelheid. He stood beside you and looked at you…deferentially, happily. And you looked at him to read in his eyes how charming you were.”

“How wicked you make it all seem!”she said.

Cordt bent over her:

“Look at me, Adelheid.”

She looked at him and was afraid.

“How dare you come up here with your retinue?”he asked.“Uphere…to me…in this room? Look at me, Adelheid. Is there not room enough in the house besides? Are there not a hundred houses in the town where you can play the game you love?”

Fru Adelheid stretched out her hands to him:

“Cordt!”

But his eyes were large and stern and she could not bear to look into them. Then she rose and stood before him with bowed head:

“Shall I go, Cordt?”she asked, softly.

He did not answer, but crossed the room. And Fru Adelheid sat down on the edge of the big chair, as if she were not at home in the room.

“Yes…Martens,”he said.

“You were not at all friendly to him this evening, Cordt.”

She said this in order to say something and without thinking, but regretted it at the same moment and looked at him dejectedly. But he made a gesture with his hand and answered, calmly:

“Indeed I was. As friendly as he could wish and a great deal more so than I feel.”

He stood by the mantel and looked down before him. She took his hand and laid her cheek against it:

“Martens is nothing to me,”she said.

“No,”said Cordt.“Not really. It is not the man…it is men. It has not gone so far as that. But it has gone farther.”

“I don't understand you,”she said, sadly.

“It is not a man, a good man or a bad one, that is wooing your heart and has won or is trying to win it. Martens is not my rival. He does not love you and he is not trying to make you believe that he is. He does not lie. That is not called for nowadays, except amongthe lower classes. With us, we rarely see so much as the shade of a scandal. Whence should we derive the strength that is needed for a rupture, a separation, a flight from society? It's a soldier that tells his girl that she is his only love…a journeyman smith that kills his faithless sweetheart…a farm-girl that drowns herself when her lover jilts her for another.”

He drew away his hand and folded his arms across his chest.

“Martens is no Don Juan. It is not his passion that infatuates women, not his manly courage and strength that wins them. He carries his desires to the backstreets; he takes his meals with his wife. He cannot love. The women become his when he covets them, but he has never belonged to any woman. His eyes, his words, his ditties sing love's praises with a charming, melancholy languor which no woman can resist. Then he lays his head in her lap and tells her of his perpetual yearnings and his perpetual disappointments. He unbosoms himself to her and begs her not to betray him. Then she loves him. And she is his…to any extent he pleases.”

She tried to speak; but Cordt shook his head in denial and she sighed and was silent.

“He is no longer young. But that makes no difference. He was never young. His unbounded susceptibility, his eternal readiness make him young in the women's eyes, as though he were a woman in man's clothing. His limp sensuousness has permeated every fbre of his body and his soul…so much so that it affects his every word, look and thought. He is destitute of will and insipid and sickly and untrustworthy. He is never hungry and he is insatiable. He swallows women and spits them out again…with morbid longings and a despondent temper and a diminished strength to live their lives.”

“Cordt!…Cordt!…What is he to me?…What is he to us?”

He looked at her and was silent for a moment. Then he said:

“Martens tends the garden in which you pluck your fowers. He is the chief gardener. But he is only one of a thousand. In the main, these passion-hunters are all alike. Shall I introduce them to you?”

“No, Cordt.”

“I can do so without hurting the feelings of any of them by mentioning their names,”he said.“You will recognize them all. You will recognize them at once.”

“Cordt!”

But Cordt did not hear.

“You will remember the man of whom we all know that he has many mistresses, even though we can say nothing to his face. He often takes a new one. Then he has one more…that is all…for he never lets go the old ones.”

“That will do, Cordt.”

“Then there is the man who tells his fair friends that he has only loved one woman in his life and that is his mother. Have you ever observed the part which the mother plays in these worn-out men's imaginations? In their books…in their love…she is the emblem for their morning headaches, their impotent compunctions. Her business it is to soothe their worm-eaten thoughts…they whisper her name while they kiss their lady-loves. I don't know which is the greater insult: that offered to the mother or to the mistress.”

Fru Adelheid tried to rise, but just then he passed so close to her that she could not move. So she remained sitting, weary and racked, and he went round the room and stopped here and there while he spoke:

“These are the men to whom our wives belong,”he said.“And they do not take them away, so that we can bemoan their loss and get new wives in their stead. They are content to nibble the crest of the tree of love, which we have planted in our garden, and to leave it to stand and thrive as best it can.”

Fru Adelheid stood up before him with moist eyes and quivering lips:

“Cordt!”

But Cordt's face was white with anger and she could not fnd a word to say.

“Do I amuse you, Adelheid?”he asked.

She went to her place by the chimney and sat down again:

“You are putting out all my lights,”she said.

He walked across the room and went on talking:

“A man's honest love goes for nothing, when one of these gentry has laid eyes on his wife. Then he is degraded to the mere husband…a dull and clumsy person…the owner of something which he cannot own. Then there awakes in my wife's mind a longing for something which she does not possess. Her peace has turned into weariness and the love which her marriage offered into an empty custom. She resigns herself. And the silly words of every silly book sing in her ears. She knows that no love endures for ever…that marriage is odious. Impatient sighs rise up in her soul, embitter her days and sadden her nights. Then she changes the gold of love for small coin and fritters it away, while the lights shine forth and the music strikes up.”

He folded his hands about his neck and stood by her chair and looked before him:

“Adelheid,”he said…“I cannot understand that the men who occasion this state of things are allowed to go free among us. And we honor them as the most distinguished of mankind. When we see a poor cripple, a shudder comes over us…am I not right, Adelheid? We are disgusted with a face full of pain. But these lepers beam before our eyes with a radiance and a beauty that know no equal.”

He walked up and down for a while and time passed and there was silence in the room.

Then he sat down in his chair, where it stood by the balcony-door, among the red fowers.

He was tired and closed his eyes. Now and then, he opened them, when a carriage drove across the square or a cry sounded. Then he closed them again and fell into a drowsiness in which everything was present to him and painful.

And then suddenly he started up.

Fru Adelheid was lying before him on the foor, with her cheek against his knee. His hand was wet with her tears.

“Don't be angry with me, Cordt!”

He looked at her, but said nothing.

“Cordt…when you speak like that…it is true…true for me also…It is all so good and so beautiful…”

He pushed back his chair and rose to his feet:

“Be very careful what you do, Adelheid,”he said.“I am not a fashionable preacher, working up your nerves and quieting them again…not a poet, reading his last work to you. I am your husband, calling you to account.”

He crossed the room and then returned and stroked her hair:

“It is beyond our strength, Adelheid,”he said, sorrowfully.“Godhelp us!”

She took his hand and laid it over her eyes, so frmly that it hurt her.

“If the old God were still here, then we could go down on our knees and fold our hands together, as they did who built this room. Would that not be good, Adelheid?”

“Yes.”

“I call upon Him, Adelheid…. And upon everything in the world that is greater than my own power…. And upon the little child downstairs…”





Chapter 10


Fru Adelheid lay on the floor before her chair and pulled the fowers of her bouquet to pieces. Cordt sat with his head leaning on his hand and looked at the fowers.

“If only you would speak, Cordt…If only you would ask me something. Why don't you ask me something?”

“What can I ask you?”

“Ask me what I am thinking about. Why I have come home so early. Why I have not been here for so long.”

“I know all that, Adelheid.”

She crossed her hands on her knee and swayed to and fro and looked at him with dark and angry eyes:

“Is there anything you do not know, Cordt?”

“No.”

“I don't think so either. You know the right and the wrong of everything between heaven and earth. You are never in doubt and never at a loss. You know at once what is good and what is bad; and then you go away and do what is good.”

He shook his head and said nothing and she grew still more angry:

“You alone know. Whoever does not obey you is lost. There is no room in the house for any but you and those who serve you.”

Cordt bent over her and lifted her up in the chair.

“Be silent for a little, Adelheid,”he said.“And stay quiet for a little.”

But she slipped to the foor again and looked at him defantly:

“I will not sit in that chair,”she said.“Never again. I am not worthy of the honor. You do not know everything, Cordt. You do not know me.”

He stroked her hair with his two hands and forced her head back:

“Then show yourself to me,”he said.

She released her head and her eyes grew moist:

“You must not be good to me,”she said.“You don't know me. I am not the woman you think.”

Then she laid her head on the chair and said, softly:

“I am so sad, Cordt.”

“You will be glad again.”

“I daresay,”she said.“But I shall always be sad.”

She took the ruined bouquet and laid it on the chair and her cheek upon it. She closed her eyes. Cordt looked at her—she seemed so tired—and they were long silent. Then she said:

“It is so cold in here.”

And then silence fell upon the room again.

“Cordt!”

Fru Adelheid sat with her back against the chair and stared into the fre with strange eyes:

“Cordt…do you know…that sometimes, when I am merriest…outside…it is as though I heard little children crying.”

He sat silent.

“I hear little children crying, Cordt. When I am dancing…andsometimes when I am singing. And at the theatre…when there are many lights and people and I am happy…then it comes so often. Then I hear little children crying…far, far away, but still I can hear them distinctly…I can never help hearing them…Cordt…do you know what it is?”

“Yes, I know, Adelheid.”

Adelheid looked at him and turned her eyes to the fireplace again:

“Sometimes it happens differently,”she said.“When I hear a child crying…when it is really a child crying…a strange child, which has nothing to do with me, which I know nothing at all about…I needn't even see it, Cordt…but then I have to cry myself.”

She was silent for a little. Then she turned her face to him and asked:

“Do you know what that is, Cordt?”

And he looked at her calmly and said again:

“Yes, I know, Adelheid.”

“I do not know,”she said and shook her head softly.“I love our little boy and love to have him with me. Don't I, Cordt?”

“Yes.”

“But he is much happier with old Marie. He prefers to be with her. He puts out his little hands to me when I come in. But, when I have had him in my arms for a while, he wants to go back to Marie. He is so small still.”

“Yes.”

“Sometimes he will not kiss me on any account. He always kisses old Marie.”

“When she comes to die, we will put a tombstone on her grave,”he said.“And on the stone we will write,‘Here lies one whom the children in the house kissed.’”

Fru Adelheid folded her hands behind her neck and looked up at the ceiling:

“At one time, you used to tell me about your mother…that is long, long ago, Cordt. You talked of her so often, in those days…why do you never do so now?”

“I think only of you.”

She moved nearer to him and laid her head on his knee:

“May I lie like this, Cordt?”

He stroked her hair and left his hand lying on her shoulder.

“That's nice,”she said.

Cordt looked at her hair and stroked it again. She closed her eyes and nestled up against him:

“It is so quiet here,”she said.“Now I will go to sleep.”

But then she grew restless again. She half raised herself and lay on her knees, with her hands folded in her lap. Her hair had become undone and slipped down over her shoulders. Her eyes stared into the fre:

“You used to tell me that your mother undressed you every night when you were a little boy,”she said.“And every morning she dressed you…always.”

“So she did.”

“You said that it so often made her late when she was going to the theatre…or else she would get up from the table when there were guests. And your father used to be so angry with her.”

He nodded.

“I think your father was right,”she said.“I think it was odd of your mother…not quite…not quite natural.”

Cordt pushed the hair from his forehead, but said nothing.

“I could see quite well that you would have me do the same. But I couldn't do it. I can't do it as well as old Marie does and I can't see that that is necessary in order to be a good mother.…Then you also told me that, one evening, when your mother had to go out, you cried without stopping until she came home again.”

“Yes.”

“But, if your mother had been like me and if old Marie had undressed you every night, then it would have been she whom you would have cried for.”

“So it would,”he replied.“But it was good for me and good for herself that it was mother.”

“I don't understand that,”she said.

But then she raised her head and looked at him with great, proud eyes:

“Yes…I understand,”she said.“I understand that it is good for a man and gives him confdence to see his wife chained to her baby's cradle.”

“That is so, Adelheid.”

He looked at her quietly and sadly and her defance was broken then and there:

“How strangely you say that,”she said.“Cordt…”

Then she laid her head on his knee again and they were silent for a time. Then she said:

“I remember the evening when I was going to my frst grown-up ball. A lady came to dress my hair. I was so solemn and the ladyso talkative. She told me that I was pretty and that I was sure to be married soon; therefore I must lose no time and dance as much as I could; for, once a girl was married, she had to give up dancing. I asked her what she meant and said that I knew many married women who danced. Then she told me that that was true enough and that there were many fne ladies who did, but then they danced their children dead and therefore it was a great sin.”

He moved in his chair. She raised her head and laid it on his knee again:

“Do you believe that we can dance our children dead, Cordt?”

He did not reply, but stroked her cheek. But she pushed his hand away and turned her face and looked at him:

“Do you believe it, Cordt?”

He nodded.

Then Fru Adelheid rose awkwardly from the floor and stood before him. Slowly, she raised her hands and pressed them against her temples.

Cordt sprang up and took her hands frmly in his own and drew her to him. But she tore herself away and her eyes stared vacantly into his and did not see him.

“Adelheid!”

“Those are your children and mine, Cordt…the little children who cry when I am merry…the children who died because their mother danced . . .”

“Adelheid!”

His voice was very soft and his eyes very gentle. She stared into them and saw a gleam in their depths. She understood that he was rejoicing within himself, because he thought that he had her as hewanted her.

He put out his hands to her and his eyes and his silent, quivering mouth spoke a thousand loving words to her. She stood stiff and cold and looked at him stiffy and coldly.

And, when his hands touched her, she drew from him and pushed her chair far back, as if she could not fnd room enough:

“You do not understand me,”she said.

She crossed the room to the balcony-door and stood there. Then she came back to the freplace, where he had sat down, and looked at him as though he were a stranger:

“Those little children who cry,”she said,“what do they cry for?”

He raised his hands and let them fall on the arms of his chair.

“Why do they cry?”she repeated.“Because they have not been brought into a world which is closed to them at the very moment when they see its beauty?…Because they are not born to die?”

She went away again and came back and sat in her chair with a strained expression on her face, as though she had to explain something to one who was slow of comprehension:

“It's no use,”she said.

Her voice was harsh. She swung her body to and fro and her thoughts hunted for words in which she could say what she wanted in such a way that it would be settled once and for all and could not be misunderstood.

Then her looks fell on Cordt, as he sat there by her side, shattered and tired, with closed eyes and nerveless hands. She saw the pain she was giving him. She wished to undo and repair it and the tears broke out in her:

“Cordt!”

She took his hand and it lay lifeless in hers.

“Can't you help me?”

“No, Adelheid.”

Then her mood changed about. She pushed herself back in her chair and crossed her arms over her breast:

“Then I must help myself,”she said.“How could you, either, an old…yes, an old man like you?”

He did not answer, did not stir, did not look at her.

“An old man like you,”she repeated,“who long for peace and quiet and nothing else. Then you give out that that is the best happiness which is the easiest and the cheapest and the best adapted to domestic use.”

Cordt had raised himself upright in his chair. His hands lay clenched about his knee, his eyes blazed.

“Then you put the woman you love in your mother's chair…your grandmother's and your great-grandmother's chair…”

He few up and stood before her with his hands on his hips and his lips pressed close together:

“Hold your tongue!”

Fru Adelheid started and looked at him with frightened eyes:

“You have no right to speak to me like that,”she said.

He sat down again and threw his head back in his chair, with his face turned away from her. She was so tired, could not fnd the words she wanted, said everything differently and in another tone than that in which she thought it.

And, as he quieted down beside her, she began to think more clearly than usual and it seemed to her that there was nothing to bedone but to say her worst. Then she clenched her fsts, to give herself strength, and closed her eyes while she spoke:

“You must know things as they are, Cordt. It is all true, as you have seen it and as you have said it. I have lied to you, Cordt. I lied in my words…I lied every time I came up here and sat with you.”

Now she looked at him. He raised his head with an effort and met her eyes. Then he turned his face away again:

“You are lying now,”he said.

She opened her mouth and closed it again, so that her teeth struck together.

Then she crossed her hands in her lap and bent over them and wept:“I don't know that,”she said.

Cordt stood up and walked across the foor, slowly and wearily and without thinking. Fru Adelheid's tears fell into her lap.

They were in this room, each independent of the other, each without sympathy for the other. Their hearts were dead, their thoughts paralyzed. They were no longer two people who loved each other and who strove to be happy, not even two who were angry or sorry because they were to be parted. They were just two people under sentence of death, whom chance had imprisoned in the same cell, but who had nothing else in common.

Cordt was the frst to come to his senses.

He was standing behind her chair and the scent of her hair awakened him. He bowed deeper over her and remembered who she was. He looked at her hands, which were wet with tears, and his heart wept with her.

Then, at that moment, he saw that he must spare his sympathy if he wished to keep her. And, when he saw this, he at once realizedthat she was lost to him for ever.

He sat down in his chair and sought for the words which he should say. He felt like the actor who has to deliver the last sentence in the play, while the audience is already leaving, because the end of the performance is there and the tension over.

“Adelheid!”he said.

That was all he could say. She understood what was passing within him and was speechless too and wept softly.




And the night sped on.

She was lying on the floor again, where she had lain before, with her cheek upon his knee. She talked…hastily, by fts and starts, without troubling what she said, as long as she could get it all said.

Cordt leant his head on his hand and his thick hair fell over his forehead. He closed his eyes and opened them again, heard what she said and forgot it again, answered from time to time and knew only that it was over.

“There are other men for me besides yourself…it is true…it is all true…Ah, Cordt, may I say it, wicked as it is?…And you will be kind…you understand that it is not that…that it is not infdelity…”

She pressed her hands together and shook her head in despair:

“Yes…yes…it is infdelity, Cordt…it is.…It is, because it's you…and because I understand it now. May I tell you, Cordt…may I?…I love the desire in their eyes…I am curious about it…. There is nothing in it that insults me…. I am happy in it, I even try to kindle it…”

“Those things are not said to one's husband, Adelheid.”

She looked at him:

“To whom shall I say them, then?”

“Those things are not said.”

“Ah…well…I say them. I will say them. Because you are the man you are. And, also, you asked me about it, Cordt…you saw it and wanted to save me…that was why you spoke to me about it, wasn't it?…I did not know what it was…now I do know…I am not lying now…but I did not know, before you said it. And it is no uglier for me…it is better for me…Cordt, Cordt…it is less ugly so.”

She hid her face in her hands and wept so that she could not speak:

“And it is worse still, Cordt…it is worse than I have said…why do you not turn me out?…Ah, if you were only dead, Cordt!…Why should you be so unhappy and why should it be I that make you so? If you cast me away, it will be only what I deserve. For I know that it is you I love…I know it now as I never knew it before…you are the man that was destined for me…”

She seized his clothes with her hands and half raised herself, so that her white face was close to his:

“Cordt…can't you wait for me?…I am coming…”

Then she released her hold and sank in a heap on the foor:

“No…no…I cannot do what you wish.”

He rose to his feet and stood before her and looked into the fre:

“It's your will that is sick, Adelheid,”he said.

He walked across the room and stood at the balcony-door and looked out. Then he came back and sat in his chair again:

“You know where the great joy lies. And you know that it would be yours and mine, if you could reach it. But you cannot.There is no sense of perspective in your life…everything to you seems quite close or quite far, quite small or quite big. You are like Martens and the others. You belong to them, because your will is weak, like theirs. You are becoming like them.”

“No, Cordt.”

“Yes, you are like them. You are a woman and you are refned and therefore you dread the mire. But you belong to them. You and I are mortal enemies. If you were she whom my son had chosen for his wife, I should tremble for his happiness. And you had the happiness which you seek…nay, the happiness that exists. You set the cup to your lips when you were young enough to stand wine and old enough to know that it was good.”

He pushed the hair from his forehead and looked round the room:

“There is nothing more to be said. You are a child of the time and the time claims you as its own. There was no sense in bringing you to the old room.”

“No, Cordt.”

“But you are clever and you are refned and you have seen its great, silent beauty. And, one day, you will see that happiness lay in the land where you were and you sallied forth to fnd it in distant climes.”

“Yes, Cordt.”

“You will see that, one day. But then it will be too late. Then the years will be gone. Then the strings of the old spinet will be rusted and mute and the spinning-wheel will have fallen to dust and the fre died out in the chimney. Then your fancy will be frightened and bewildered, like the bird that keeps on fapping against the window-pane. Your faith will be lost and your modesty turned to unchastity.”

He rose and went across to the balcony-door. Fru Adelheid lay with her cheek on the fender and with closed eyes.

A silence hung over the room greater than it had ever known before. They both of them felt it and felt it as the silence when pain is dumbed at the approach of death. They no longer fought against the inevitable, against what was stronger than themselves; and they were so tired that they no longer thought of the defeat which they had suffered, but only smiled in the peace which they had won.




And the night sped on.

They were sitting again in the quaint old chairs and looked at the embers that were expiring in the hearth. The candles were nearly burnt out.

They were both of them very gentle and very still. It seemed years since they had last differed. Their faces were calm, their eyes clear and sad, when they looked at each other, but without longing, without anger or bitterness.

And they looked at each other and talked together…of that which was over.

Their words had lost all sting. He held her hand in his and pressed it as that of a good friend. Once, she pushed his hair from his forehead as she would have done to a child.

“If any one saw us sitting here, he would not understand what has happened to us,”said Cordt.

“No.”

“And, if anyone had heard every word that fell between us in this room, he would perhaps say that we were a pair of simpletons.”Fru Adelheid shook her head:

“It is well that nothing more has happened to us,”she said.

“I don't know,”replied Cordt.

Then he let go her hand and drew himself up in his seat:

“Sometimes I think it would be easier if there were an action that had to be forgiven,”he said.“Something to be forgotten. Then it would not be over.”

“It is not over,”she said.“We have missed happiness, because I did not keep the measure by which I should be gauged. But our boy down below lives and he can win a wife who shall sit in the old room with honor.”

“No,”said Cordt.“The secret of the old room is out. It does not suit these times and still less the times to come. Our son shall not see his happiness shattered here.”

And, a little later, he pressed his hand hard to his temples and said so softly that she just heard it:

“For it is hard to decrease one's own happiness.”




The candles went out…one after the other.

“It is late, Adelheid,”he said.“We had better go.”

“Yes,”she said.

But neither of them was able to.

They looked at each other and sat steeped in the same thoughts, afraid to end this still night, which was to be followed by bad days.




Then the last candle went out.

Cordt's lamp still burnt on the table, but it was as though everything in the room was displaced in its glow. There wasdarkness where light had been before and great shadows on the wall.

They both felt it as something uncanny and involuntarily moved closer together.

“Sing to me, Adelheid,”he said.

She went to the spinet and sat down and looked at the keys.

“Sing the last of the Lenore songs.”

She looked over her shoulder, but could not see the expression on his face.

Then she sang:

When death comes, come, Lenore, too:

Thou wert Life's beacon rosy-red;

And, by those glad, great eyes shot through,

In that same instant, Death were dead.

So am I never Death's, but thine;

No tears shed I, nor once complain:

Set only thy red lips to mine

And take thy soul again.



I shall have seen for the last time

The radiant, loving eyes I treasure;

And what of song and what of crime

I wrought let others weigh and measure.

But thou sometimes wilt not forget,

When evening creeps across the pane,

The scent of shy blue violet

That sweetened all the plain.

Cordt was standing behind her chair when the song was fnished. She did not perceive it, but sat with her hands on the keys and softly repeated the last lines.

He looked at her hair and her hands and at the white dress that hung over her shoulders and her lap. He knew as he had never known before what he had lost and knew that he would never win it back. His hands trembled, his eyes burned. He thought that he must kill her and himself.

Then he spoke her name.

She looked up and looked at him.

She forgot everything, saw nothing but him. He could see it in her great, strange eyes and in her red mouth.

And she sprang up with a cry of happiness and he took her in his arms and carried her away.





Chapter 11


The candles on the mantelpiece were lighted and their gleam fell through the balcony-door over the square, as it had done every evening since the house was built.

Outside, the square shone with a thousand lights. There was a sound of carriages, but at a distance, for the house was thrust a long way back and its walls were as thick as the walls of a castle.

And, when time passed and night came, the noise died away and you could hear the rippling of the fountain, which never begins and never stops, and cries, no one knowing what they are, solitary steps that approach and retreat again.

Cordt stood by the freplace of the empty room.

He stared at the places where the quaint old things had stood which had seen his race pass through the room.

He remembered every single piece that had been brought there and looked at the empty spot where each had stood. He closed his eyes and saw everything in its place again…the spinet sang…Fru Adelheid's white train rustled over the carpet.

He thought of the man who had built the house and the room and who had called it the soul of the house and its tradition and its secret chamber. Of all those after him who had brought their wives in here…of the day when he himself stood in the room for the frst time.

And he went and opened the secret recess in the wall which hid the old, yellow document on which each of them who took possession of the room had written his name and his wife's.

He read the report of the builder of the house, with its plain, homely phrases.

And, when he had read it and read it again, he struck out his own name and Fru Adelheid's and went away and left the door open behind him.





PART II　CORDT'S SON





Chapter 12


When Cordt had fnished telling the story of the old room, he sat by the window and looked across the square, where the dusk was gathering about the newly-lighted lamps.

The servant entered noiselessly and lit the chandelier and went out noiselessly again. And the light flled the whole of the room and fell upon Cordt, who sat and gazed before him, and upon Finn, who stood by him with his eyes fxed on his face.

But Finn and Cordt were not where the light found them.

They were in the wonderful mystery of the old room. They heard the rippling of the fountain outside in the silent square; they saw the blaze of the red fowers on the balcony. The slender notes of the spinet sounded in their ears; Fru Adelheid's white gown rustled over the foor.

And, when Cordt turned his face towards his son, he appeared to Finn as a very big, old man; and Finn seemed to Cordt the little child that once lay and laughed in the cradle and fought with its little fat fsts.

Then Cordt stood up and took Finn's arm and they walked to and fro, silent, overcome with what they had seen and afraid lest they should shatter the dream by speaking.

They walked for some time. And, when, at length, they stopped before the window, which was dewed with the heat, so that theycould see nothing through it, Cordt remembered that there was still something which Finn ought to know and which he could not ask about.

He looked at Finn and remembered how he had loved his mother.

It was her eyes, but more restful-looking; her mouth, but paler and tired, as though it had tried a thousand times to say something which it never could. He had her slender waist and he was taller than Cordt, but carried his height like a burden. Then he also had Fru Adelheid's pale cheeks and forehead, but Cordt's hair, only thicker still and blacker.

“Finn,”said Cordt and laid his hands on his shoulders.

Finn started and could not look at him. But Cordt took him under the chin and lifted his head and looked with a sad smile into his frightened eyes:

“There is only one thing left to tell you, Finn…Fru Adelheid did not take a lover.”

His smile widened when he saw his son's sudden and great joy; and he drew him to him and kissed him.

But then he suddenly left him and sat down somewhere in the room, with his back to him. Finn followed him and stood by him for a while and thought kindly and fondly of him and could fnd nothing to say.

The thoughts rushed through Cordt's head.

Now that he had lived through it all anew, the scab broke which the silence of many years had placed upon the wound in his will. His eyes grew hard and angry, he wanted to speak as he used to speak when he fought his hopeless fght for Fru Adelheid.

But then his glance fell upon Finn.

He sat as he liked best to sit, with bent head and his hands open upon his knees.

And Cordt grew gentle again and said, softly:

“You are glad, of course. For, you see, she is your mother.”

He crossed the room and came back and stood with his arm over the back of the chair and looked at Finn, who was lost in his thoughts. It was silent in the room and silent outside, for it was Sunday. They could hear the bells ringing for evening service.

“She never secured the red flowers in the place of the blue which she valued so little,”said Cordt,“I don't know…I often thought…”

The bells rang out.

There was one that was quite close and one that was farther away, but louder, nevertheless. And there was a sound of distant bells which could not be distinguished from one another, but which sang in the air.

It sounded louder than it was, because they were thinking of it; and the ringing grew and flled the room with its deafening clamor.

Then there came a rumbling in the gateway. The carriage drove out in the soft snow, where they could not hear it.

“That's Fru Adelheid going to church,”said Cordt.

He sat down by his son and began to talk in a low voice and without looking at him.

The bells rang and then suddenly stopped and increased the silence a hundredfold.

“There was a night at Landeck when the bells caught her, a night following upon a day of sunshine and merriment and manypeople. She was the gayest of us all and, in the evening, all at once, she became silent and tired, as so often happened, without any cause that I knew of…. You were with us. You were ten years old then; you lay and slept. We had been standing together by your bed and looking at you and she began to cry and I could do nothing but hold her hand in mine and stop speaking.”

Finn listened, as he had just listened to the bells, without making out what the words had to tell him. He only knew that his mother was without blame and that his father had been able to tell it him all on that day and to leave it to him to pronounce judgment between himself and her. His joy at this sang within him and made all the rest easy and light and indifferent.

And Cordt continued:

“Then I went out on the verandah with my cigar and she stood in the doorway and listened to the bell of a little chapel up in the mountains, where we had been during the day. We had heard the story when we were there. Once, in the old days, a pious man had built the chapel in expiation of a sin and, since then, the bell had rung two hours after midnight every day…She asked whether it would go on ringing till the end of the world and we came to talk of all the bells that ring over the earth, by day and by night, sun up and sun down, and comfort weary mortals…. Sometimes she was silent. But the bell rang up there constantly. And she constantly began to talk again and constantly about the same thing. About the bells that sounded so eternally and so identically over the whole world…about those who heard them for the first time, one day when they were running like wild heathens in the endless wood…about those whose will suddenly broke in the midst of the modern crowd, so thatthey fell on their knees and crept away where the bells summoned them.”

Finn looked up. The words now caught his mind and he woke from his dreams.

“I see her before me still, as she stood on the night when she carried her soul to God. Her strange eyes lifted to the stars…her white face…her hands…and her words, which came so quickly, as though her life depended upon their coming, and so heavily, as though every one of them caused her pain. She never gave it a thought that I was there: she spoke as though she were doing public penance in the church-porch…. And then she declared that it was over…. It had become empty around her and cold and dark to anguish and despair, there where her glad eyes had beamed upon the lights and the crowd of the feast. Despair had come long since and slowly and she had closed her eyes to it and denied it. It had grown and come nearer to her and she had run away from it, as though she were running for her life. Now it was there and reached from earth to heaven, in her, around her, far and wide. And, if the bells could not conquer it, then she must die.”

Cordt spoke so softly that Finn could hardly catch his words.

“Then the bell up there ceased. Soon after, the day dawned and the sun shone on her white, moist cheeks. She was still now and silent, but her thoughts were the same. When things began to stir around us, in the town and at the hotel, she went out, I did not know where, but I daresay she was at the chapel. Towards evening, she returned and, at midnight, we sat on the verandah again and listened to the church-bell…. A week passed thus. I often feared for her reason. She always talked of the same thing and it was almost worsewhen she was silent. I sent old Hans home with you and, the next day, we left. But it was long before we reached home. She wanted to travel by the same road which we had taken on the journey out. She said she wanted to pray in every church which she had passed on her hunt for happiness through the world.”

Finn half raised himself in his chair:

“And did you?”he asked.

“I did as she wished. It became a pilgrimage to every region where life lies nakedest in its pleasure. Restlessly we travelled from place to place. She omitted none, afraid lest there should remain a single sin which she had not prayed away, a single memory which the bells had not rung into the grave.”

“And then did you come home?”

Cordt looked at his son as if he had forgotten that he was in the room. He suddenly awoke to the consciousness of what lay between those days and these; and his face became so gloomy and his eyes so serious that Finn was frightened.

“Then we came home. And then…”

He rose quickly and stood with his arms crossed on his breast and looked at Finn:

“Then we came home. And the years passed and Fru Adelheid recovered her peace of mind. She found herself again and became the same as in the old days. Her thoughts waver restlessly, her desires yearn insatiably. Her carriage now rattles through the streets as before…only it stops at the church instead of the theatre.”

Finn wanted to speak, but could not, because Cordt stood in front of him and looked at him fxedly and nodded to him, once, as if to say that he knew what it was and that it was no use.

“She goes to Heaven's table,”said Cordt,“and Heaven comes to her parties.”

Finn sank back in his chair.

He was surprised and ashamed that he was not grieved with his father for saying that, nor with his mother, if it were true. He knew that he ought to rouse himself to protest or sympathy, but could not, because he understood it all so well.

But Cordt crossed the room with a frm stride:

“Heaven is not what Fru Adelheid thinks, nor where she seeks it,”he said.“Perhaps you will not understand me until you have lived longer in the world; but look here, Finn…what I have seen of God in my life I have seen most in those who denied Him. In their sense of responsibility, in their humanity…in their pride I have seen God's splendor. The others, those who confess His name and fll His house…they masked Him from me so closely, when they ought to glorify Him, made Him so small, when they praised His might…”

He talked about this for a time. Finn sat dumb and helpless in his chair and wished his father would cease. He felt like one who has inadvertently witnessed something he ought not to see, or like one who is receiving a confdence under a false pretence.

And deep down within him lay a little ironical astonishment at the fre and authority with which his father was talking.

But, at that moment, Cordt sat down in front of him with both his hands in his own and sad and gentle eyes and words as soft and humble as though he were a sinner begging for peace:

“I don't know, Finn. I cannot really tell you anything about it. I can never talk with you about these things. A father is a poor creature, Finn, and I am a poor father. I cannot tell you that the forestis green and that the birds sing and that there is nothing behind the blue sky. I dare not, Finn. I do not think I have the right to. I cannot go to church with you, either…nor even be glad when you go with your mother.”

He pressed Finn's hands nervously. They lay dead in his and Finn did not know what to do with his eyes.

“But I must talk to you a little…just this once…to-day, when I have confessed to you and made up your parents' accounts. If you will try to understand me…and to forgive me…to forgive us, because we are not so rich as our child could expect…since we have a child…You love the bells, Finn. When they ring, you fall a-dreaming; they ring you far away from where you are. You were like that ever since you were a little boy. And I can well understand it. I love them, too. I am glad because they are there. But…Finn…Finn, there are so many bells in the world besides those which summon us to church. Every man has his own, which are his and his only…which he alone can hear, which call no one but him. There are men, opulent, charming men, for whom the bells ring wherever they set foot. They lead more powerful lives than we and prouder lives. They suffer us…those of us who love them. But there is not in the world a man so small but that the bells call him. One has them in his work, Finn. And one in his child…and one in his love. For one they hang in a neat little room where his mother lives and where he can only come for an hour, perhaps…on a Sunday…It is not the same for the one as for the other, Finn, but the bells are there always. They call their man back when he has strayed from the way he should go, or, if that is too late, they ring for his remorse. They ring to the banquet and they ring their music when he is tired andsad…But the church-bells…they ring for the man whose ears life has deafened…and life makes such a terrible noise. They ring on Sundays to remind us of that which we have forgotten throughout the week…. And it is well that they are there…. But…Finn…it is so tragic when the church-bells drive and tumble people together who once had each his own sacred church. It is just as when a home breaks up and the old fnd a refuge in the workhouse. The sun shines through the windows and it is warm indoors and there are fowers in the casement. But there was once something that was better…For your mother and me, Finn…for us the bells used to ring in the old room.”

He was silent and no longer looked at Finn. And Finn was at ease again and at last found words for what he had long wanted to say:

“May I use the old room, father ? May I set it up again…all as it was…and live there with my books ?…”

Cordt released his son's hands and his face wore a look that made Finn regret his request. They both rose to their feet. And, at that moment, Cordt's face lit up with a smile:

“That you may,”he said.“You dear child, who never asked for anything. Let this, then, be my present to you today.”




This happened on the day when Cordt's son completed his twenty-frst year.





Chapter 13


Finn stood in the old room with the yellow document in his hand:

God brought me thus far, that I was able to erect this fair house, which shall stand till distant times, a witness to my might and that of my race. Here shall be upright living and generous dealing; the house shall be faithfully guarded from father to son; good men and women shall sit in the hall and dance to the sound of flutes and violins.

I have placed this room in the most secret part of the house and no one knows of it but the architect who built it and my oldest servant. But I have sealed the architect's tongue with a solemn oath and a heavy fee; and my servant is true to me.

I have decorated the room with gilt and figured leather hangings and costly carpets from the East. I have had two great armchairs made in Milan, whose woodwork is carved into birds and animals which grin strangely in the dark, but cease to do so when the lights are lit.

Then I gave my servant a key of the room and told him to care for it faithfully. Every evening, when it grows dusk, he is to light the candles on the mantelpiece; and he is to do this even if he know that his master is travelling in distant lands. Every morning, he is to adjust the room with his own hands. None but himself is ever to cross the threshold.

For this room shall be for me and my wife and for none other in the world. Therefore I placed it in the most secluded part of the house, far from the counting-house, where we work, from the passages, along which our servants go, and from the drawing-room, where we receive our guests, ay, even from our marriage-bed, where she sleeps by my side.

It shall be the temple of our marriage, hallowed by our love, which is greater than anything that we know. Here we will pray to Him Who gave us to each other. Here we will talk gladly and earnestly, every evening when our hearts impel us to. And, when we come to die, our son shall bring his wife here and they shall do as we did.

This evening, which is the first in my new house, I brought my wife in here and told her my wish. She listened to my words in love and gladness and I have written down in this document how it all happened and we have set our names to it in witness for those who come after us.

Finn read their names and the names of those who had taken possession of the room after the builder and his wife. Last of all stood Cordt's name and Fru Adelheid's, which were struck out again.

Then he put the document back in its place and locked it up andlooked round the room.

The old room stood again as it used to stand, built high over the square, long and deep and silent, like a spot where there is no life.

The balcony was white with snow and the sparrows hopped in the snow. Inside, behind the colored panes, stood many red fowers and longed for the sun. The dust had been removed from the fgured-leather hangings, which shone with a new brightness. The oriental carpet spread over the foor like a lord returning from exile and once more taking possession of his estates.

And all the old glories had found their places again and stood as lawfully and restfully as though it had never been otherwise. The spinet was there and the jar with the man writhing through thorns and the celestial globe whose stars shone and ran: all the furniture which the room's different owners had set there in the course of time, each after his own taste and heart.

Before the freplace stood the two great, strange armchairs.

Finn felt as if he were in a cathedral where every flag was a tombstone over a famous man. His senses drank the odor of the bygone times, his fancy peopled the room with the men and women who had sat there and exchanged strong and gentle words, while the house lay sleeping around them.

With it all, he became lost in thought of those who had sat there last and after whom no others were to come, those two who had given him the life which he knew not what to do with.

He saw them before him in the love and struggle of their youth. He heard their voices in the room, he saw Fru Adelheid's red mouth and Cordt's steady eyes. He saw Cordt bring his wife into the room, which was the soul of the house and its tradition and its secretchamber, and show her the strange things which his ancestors had put there.

He saw him on the day when he stood alone by the freplace…in the empty room…and struck out his own name and Fru Adelheid's from the document and went away and left the door open behind him…

He saw all this as it had happened. But they were not his father and mother. They were two attractive people of whom he had read in a book and grown fond, as a man loves art, palely and with no self-seeking in his desire.

Finn drew one of the big chairs over to the window and sat down and sat there for long.

He was sitting there when Fru Adelheid came.

She stood in the doorway, in her white gown, with her white hair, and nodded to him. Then she turned her face round to the room and looked at it.

And then that happened which was only the shadow of a dream that vanished then and there: everything came to life in the room.

The spinet sang, the queer faces on the old chairs raised themselves on their long necks; there was a whispering and a muttering in every corner…

Fru Adelheid shrank back against the door. She did not see Finn, did not remember that he was there.

But Finn saw her.

He rose from his chair and his eyes beamed:

“You light up the room, mother,”he said,“and the room lights up you.”

He took her hand and kissed it and, with her hand in his, FruAdelheid went through the old room, which had been too narrow for her youthful desires.

The fairy-tale was over and the dread. But the glow still lay over her figure and made her look wonderfully pretty. Her cheeks were as pink as a girl's; her step was light, her eyes moist and shy. She laughed softly and gladly, while she looked at the old things and talked about them and touched them.

She told the story of the woman who used to sing when she was sad and who had brought the old spinet there; and her hands shook as she struck a chord and the slender, beautiful notes sounded through the room. Of the spinning-wheel, which had whirred merrily every evening for many a good year and which stood as it was, with thread upon the spindle. Of the celestial globe, which had been the toy of the man whose intellect was obscured. Of the doll with the vacant face, which stood there in memory of the lady who dreaded the deep silence of the room and never entered it but once; but her son, who loved her, had hidden the doll in the curtain. Of Fru Lykke, whose portrait had hung where the light stain was, but hung there no longer, because her marriage had been dissolved.

Of the jar with the man writhing through thorns, which she herself had brought as her gift, she said nothing. She passed her hand over its bright surface and was silent.

Finn's eyes clung to her.

Never had he seen his beautiful mother so beautiful. He did not know that look, or that smile on her mouth, or that clear ring in her voice.

At times, he added something to what she was telling and spoke with such profound intelligence that she was quite surprised andfrightened. Now he guessed her words before she uttered them. Then he knew something which she had never suspected.

Secretly, her fear increased as to what Cordt could have told him.

But Finn was lost in his delight.

And, fascinated by her beauty and the strange things he had seen and heard and the deep silence of the room, he forgot that the seal of the old room was broken and wished to play the game as vividly as possible.

He drew the second of the two big chairs across to the window and made her sit down and sat himself beside her:

“Now you are not my mother,”he said.“You are my young bride. I have brought you into the sanctuary to-day and now I will initiate you into the mysteries.”

Fru Adelheid turned very pale and Finn took her hand penitently:

“Have I hurt you, mother?”

She shook her head and forced herself to smile.

Then he walked into the room again and rejoiced at all this and talked about it. But she remained sitting with knitted brow.

She was heavy at heart, because it seemed to her, all at once, that she was not his mother, as they sat talking here in the secret chamber of the house. The old days came in their great might; and their strong memories and impressive words drowned the bells which had rung her into another world.

It was the echo here, in the old room, of Cordt's words and of his love…of the strong faith and great happiness of the race which had sprouted in the good mould of tradition and produced flowerafter fower in the times that passed.

Fru Adelheid thought—for a moment—that it would have been well had things happened as Cordt wished.

But, at the same instant, she was seized by a thought that suddenly made her rebellious and young, as when she was here last, many years ago.

She thrust her chair back hard and looked with sparkling eyes round the room where everything and every memory was hostile to her.

She looked at Finn, who was standing by the celestial globe and trying to set it going, but could not, because the spring was rusty and refused to work.

She wondered, when the time came for Finn to take a wife…would he try to revive the tradition and bring her here and sit down with her in the old chairs?

Then Finn's son and his son after him would read her name, which was written on the yellow document and struck out again. She would be like one of those who were branded in that family…Legends would grow about her love of going out and her hunt after happiness which did not exist….

“Come and help me, mother,”said Finn.

She went over and pressed hard on the spring and the clockwork hummed.

“See how you let loose the magic,”he said.

He went on talking, delighted with the stars, which lit up and ran.

“Sit down here by me, Finn.”

She waited till he came and a little longer, as though she couldnot find the words she wanted, and did not look at him while she spoke:

“Finn,”she said and put her hand on his shoulder and drew it away again immediately.“Finn…once…ever so many years ago, I was alone, one evening, in the old room. I had often been here before, you know…with father. And I was under the power of the old room and never happy. I was young, Finn, and it went so terribly hard with my longing and my gladness. I could not understand that and could not mitigate it or get over it. For father belonged to the room and it was his and all the queer things in it and they were all against me. Every time I came to the door, my heart stopped beating…. And once I was inside…it was…it was as if my own words were taken from my tongue and others put in their place for me to speak…beautiful words and good words, Finn, but not mine. But then, when I took courage and said what I wanted to say, it sounded as if I was defying the old room and father and God himself. And then . . .”

Fru Adelheid felt that she was on the point of betraying something great and fne that had been laid in her hands. She looked round as if she were afraid that there was some one in the room or that the room itself would rise up against her in its venerable might.

But there was no one and it was silent.

Then she turned her face to Finn and looked at him and said, gaily:

“But that evening, Finn, I broke the spell of the old room. I tore the veil from the Holy of Holies and saw that there was nothing behind it. For the frst time, I breathed freely in my own home.”

Fru Adelheid did not tell how, at the same moment, she hadbeen overcome by terror and fled from the room. But she did not gain what she thought by her lie. For Finn looked at her sorrowfully and said:

“How could you do that, mother? How could you fnd it in your heart?”

“Are you also under the spell?”she asked.

There was in her tone a scorn which was stronger than she intended and which frightened herself. But Finn simply paid no attention to it:

“The old room no longer exists,”he said.“It is nothing more than an image, a monument…my fancy, which father humored me in.”

She turned her face away and listened.

“But had I lived in the days of the old room,”he said,“then it would certainly have captured me and held me captive.”

“Yes…you have been talking to father,”she said, softly.

“Yes.”

Then he lay down before her, with his cheek on her hand, as he so often did:

“Yes,”he repeated.“And…mother…I love you. You are so pretty. But we will not talk about the old room…ever. For I think it is the most wonderful…and the most beautiful and the strongest thing I know of.…But it hurts me that I am not wholly your son…or father's either, that I might devote myself to one of you in sharing your strongest feelings. And I cannot talk to father about it…neither can we two, can we?”

Fru Adelheid did not answer him, but stroked his hair with her hand. Neither of them spoke and it was quite silent in the room.

In the silence she became herself again. The many moulded years came to their own again and the bells rang monotonously and ever more strongly from out of the noise of the world, which had drowned them.

She marvelled at the excitement into which the old room had thrown her. Quenched was the love which had made her its mistress and quenched the red desire which made it too narrow. She thought of Cordt, who had fought, she considered, for what was not worth fighting for. Sorrowfully she looked at her tall, silent boy, whose weary thoughts kept pace so well with her own.

She crossed her hands in her lap and the light faded in her eyes. The glow of the old room withdrew from her face, her words became restful as her thoughts.

Finn looked at her, but did not see this. For him, too, the fairy-tale was over. He was sitting in his chair again with bent head and his hands open on his knees.

And, without their doing anything or thinking of it, they came in their usual way to talk together. It was not any interchange of thoughts and still less a contest of opinions. They said nearly the same thing and, wherever the thoughts of the one roamed, he found the other's. Often their words were solemn, but never powerful. Often the one was silent and agreed with the other. Many times they sat long without saying anything and thought they had told each other everything.

“Look,”said Finn, pointing out of the window.“How hideous!”

A hearse came trotting across the square.

He moved in his chair and said:

“A hearse should always drive at a foot's pace, solemnly andceremoniously…always…as though they were only driving the horses to water. And soldiers should always hold themselves stiff and starched, keeping step and time, even when they are taking their shoes to the cobbler's. Then it would all be easier.”

He was silent for a while. Then he slowly turned his face to her:

“I was talking about it to father the other day,”he said.“I happened to say something of the kind.”

She looked at him in surprise.

“I don't know how it came about. But he laughed and said I ought to write an article about it or form a society for preserving the correct pace of hearses.”

Fru Adelheid smiled and laid her hands in her lap and looked at them.

“Then he suddenly became serious and came up to me and laid his hands on my shoulders:‘Hearses ought to drive fast,’ he said,‘gallop…at a rousing pace. Away with the dead, Finn! Let life grow green and blossom !’”

“Father is so masterful,”said Fru Adelheid.

Finn nodded.

Then they began to talk about Cordt. They often did so. And they were always eager to find good words to praise him in. But under the words there lay the consciousness, like a secret understanding between them, that he was made of a coarser clay than they.

They never said this; but they felt a sort of patronizing pity for him, such as one feels for a person who runs and runs, when it is good to sit still.

But, when they talked together, Fru Adelheid knew that deepin Finn's soul there lay a secret yearning towards just that masterful side in his father which frightened him.

It was so weak, only a pale refection of her own young love, a distant echo of the voice which had stated Cordt's case in her own heart when he was fghting to win her.

But it was enough to hurt her. She thought she only had her son for a time. She traced a certain disdain in the intimacy to which he admitted her. She thought there was something in him which was greater than what he gave her and which was Cordt's or would become so.

And she realized that the fght for Finn would become harder than that which broke the seal on the door of the old room.

Finn was absorbed in what had flled his mind, the whole day, with light and color. He was thinking now of his mother's visit to the room on the evening when she had broken the spell:

“I simply cannot understand how you could have the heart,”he said.

She knew at once what he meant, but said nothing.

“There ought to be some law, like that in the fairy-story, where he who lifted the veil had to die,”he said.“And there ought to be veils upon veils…veils upon veils…Can you bear to look at the sun, mother? Women ought to go in a veil and never…never raise it, except when the occasion was so great that everything grew great.…And one ought not to see the people who play…”

Fru Adelheid half raised herself in her chair.

She wanted to tell him that, on that evening, she was punished for her presumption with the greatest terror which she had ever experienced in her life. But she could not. Then she said, quitequietly and with her eyes looking out over the square:

“And suppose there were some one who could not…suppose the veil stifed one…”

Finn looked out into space like her:

“Veils upon veils.…Veils over the dead,”he said.

Fru Adelheid sighed and said nothing.

“Then one could live,”said Finn.





Chapter 14


From that day onward, Finn only left the old room when obliged.

The spring had opened the fountain before the house and he was happy at its rippling, which never began and never stopped. The red fowers were put out on the balcony: when the wind blew, their petals fluttered right over into the basin of the fountain and rocked upon the water. He followed their dance through the air and wondered if they would reach their goal.

His best time was in the evening, when the square shone with a thousand lights.

He loved the dying day.

He knew every light that went out, every sound as it stopped. And he liked the sound best when it stopped and the light when it went out. He thought that the people who moved down below, disguised in the darkness, were of another kind or better than those whom the sun shone upon. He had no more to do with them than with the others; but he liked them better.

Then, when night came and the rippling of the fountain sang louder and louder through the silence and cries sounded from down below, no one knowing what they were, and solitary steps were heard, that approached and retreated again, then he lit the candles on the mantelpiece and sat down in one of the old chairs, there where the owners of the house and their wives had sat when the house sleptand they had something to say to each other.

He looked round the room, where the things sang in every dark corner, and simply could not conceive that he had not known the old room before.

He was more at home here than anywhere else: here, where he was outside the world, which worried him, because it demanded that of him which he had not; here, where every spot and every object told how all had been said and done and accomplished in the old days, so that he had nothing else to do but listen wonderingly and rejoice at its marvellous beauty.

Then he fell a-dreaming and remained sitting till the lights went out.

“He does not sleep enough,”said Fru Adelheid, anxiously.

Cordt crossed the foor with the same thought in his mind. Then he stopped where she was sitting and looked at her:

“I wonder, is he ever awake, Adelheid?”he said.

By day, Finn generally sat at the window and stared out, idly and silently, with his hands open on his knees.

Often, when Cordt was crossing the square, he thought that he could see Finn's old face behind the window-panes. He would stop and nod and beckon to him.

But Finn never saw him. For he saw nothing positively.

And Cordt went on…in and out…constantly longing to see the strong air of the old room color his son's cheeks and rouse his will…constantly trusting that, sooner or later, this would happen.

He never went up there since the day when he and his old servant had arranged the room as it used to be.

And Finn was glad of this. He was so afraid lest that shouldhappen that a long time passed before he could suppress his terror when he heard any one coming. And, even when he had recovered his composure, he knew that it would happen sooner or later and that the day of its happening would be a gloomy one.

For he well understood the eternal loving question in Cordt's eyes and it hurt him and frightened him. He dreaded the craving in his affection, which was greater than a father's. It was like that of a sovereign for the heir who is to occupy the throne after him.

And Finn could not take the reins of empire in his slack hands or bear the pressure of the crown upon his head, which ached at the mere thought of it.

But Fru Adelheid often came; and they two were comfortable up there, in the old room.

She came with no craving; and, if she was doubtful and restless, as she often was, since Finn had moved up into the old room, then she would be quite silent when the door closed behind her.

Silent like Finn…and like the big chairs and the jar with the man writhing through thorns…silent like the spinning-wheel, which had whirred merrily every evening for many a good year and stood as it was with thread upon its spindle.

He looked at her and smiled and nodded when she spoke. He himself talked . . .for long at a time and then stopped, without its making any difference, and listened to the rippling of the fountain and the voices in the old room, which always talked to him and plainest when Fru Adelheid was with him.

He told her that, when she came, the room was no longer his own.

For then he felt like a stranger, a man of another period, who should suddenly find himself in an old ruined castle, full of marvellous dangers and adventures, and stand face to face with the last of those who had lived the castle's rich, wonderful life.

Once he spoke her name aloud just as she was entering at the door. It was dark in the room and his voice and fgure were so like Cordt's that she grew pale and frightened. But he did not see this and she forced a laugh and soon forgot it.

And, gradually, the wonderful solemnity of the old room retreated into the background, when they were both there, for they spent more and more of their time there and at last simply did not think they were together except there. But Finn was always able to summon it up when he wished.

They used to read together.

And that happened in this way, that one of them found a book, a treasure of silence and singing, which was the only sort that they felt equal to, and read it and gave it to the other, who then read it while they were together.

They found most of the books in foreign languages and it seemed as if there were no end of them. Also, the fact that the language was foreign made the book dearer to them, because it carried them farther afeld.

When they had read one of these books, they lived in it for a time…not in its action, among its characters, for there was no action and no characters, but in its music. They tuned their thoughts and words in its key.

Then they felt as if they had passed through some experience or as if they were travelling.

“The artist lives,”said Finn.“He makes the sky blue and grey for himself…for himself and for us all. He wipes everything outwith his hand and builds it up again…greater, ever greater. He is the master. He is God.”

One day, he asked Fru Adelheid to sing.

She had not sung for many years, except in church, and was surprised at his request:

“I have given up singing, Finn.”

He lay down before her and looked up smiling into her face:

“I can remember so well when you used to sing,”he said.“You often sang to me when I was a boy. But one occasion…one occasion I remember in particular. There were many visitors and I, of course, had long been in bed, but I was not asleep. For old Marie had promised to take me down to the dining-room when the people had got up from dinner and you were to sing. She told me that, when there was company and all the candles were lighted and you were prettiest and brightest, then you sang a thousand times more beautifully than usual.”

She took her eyes from his face and laid her head back in her chair.

“I kept awake till she came and it lasted long. But then I heard you and also saw you for a moment through the door.”

“And was it so nice?”

“I don't remember,”he said.“But I remember the many faces.…I should know them again if I saw them now, I think. And best of all I remember father's.”

Fru Adelheid rose:

“What shall I sing?”she asked.

He laughed with content, went to the spinet and opened it. Then he took up one of the pieces of music:

“Look what I have found,”he said.“This was sung by the onewho put the spinet here. Look, here is her name: she herself wrote both the words and the music.…See how pale the writing is…and how distinct.”

Fru Adelheid stood with the old, yellow sheet in her hand. She hummed the tune and struck the keys.

Then she sat down to the spinet and sang:

Day is passing, dearest maiden:

Ere thou knowest, comes the night;

Warning winds, with fragrance laden,

Bring cool air and colder light.

We must part: time hastens so!

Day is passing, dew is falling.

Hark! Thy mother's voice is calling:

Dearest maiden, I must go.



Part we must, dear maid, in sorrow!

Day is surely doomed to die.

Ah, but we shall find to-morrow

Countless joys we let go by,

Countless words we uttered not,

Hours we robbed of wasted chances,

Eyes we balked of mutual glances,

Countless kisses we forgot.



Happy smiles will haunt thee dreaming

On a couch of virgin white;

In my brain thy picture gleaming,

I shall hasten through the night.

Let the crimson sun depart!

Brighter sunshine in thy face is,

Sunshine of remembered places,

Love's own sunshine in thy heart.

She remained sitting a while with the old music-sheet in her hand. Then Finn said:

“She used to sing that. Do you know if she was happy, mother?”

“She was often sad,”said Fru Adelheid.“And, when she was sad, she sang.”

She put down the sheet and took up the first music-book that came to hand, but threw it aside, as though it had burnt her fngers.

It was the Lenore songs, which she had sung to Cordt.

She rose and went back to her place beside Finn. Then she sprang up and stood with her arms crossed on her breast and sat down again and stared with great eyes through the window:

“Finn…if I sang it to you…would you recognize the…the song you heard when Marie carried you down…?”

He woke from his dream and looked at her in surprise:

“The song…no…I should not. Why, do you remember it?”

“No,”said Fru Adelheid.

They long sat silent. Twilight fell and it grew dark in the room.

“Mother,”said Finn,“what are women like?”

She turned her face slowly towards him. He did not look at her. His eyes were far away and she realized that he had forgotten his question or did not know that he had put it.





Chapter 15


Fru Adelheid stood in her wraps at the window and looked out. The horses were stamping in the porch below; the footman stood by the carriage-door and waited.

They were going to the station to fetch Finn.

He had been abroad the whole summer.

This was the frst time he had been away alone and he had not enjoyed himself abroad. From Florence, Spain and Paris he had written to ask if he might not come home. But Cordt was resolved that he should remain abroad for the time agreed upon.

He wrote oftenest to Fru Adelheid…and stupidly and awkwardly, because he knew that his father would read the letters. Cordt noticed this, but said nothing. He hurried through the letters as though he were looking for something positive and put them down with a face as though he had not found it.

He always gave Fru Adelheid the letters he received, although she never asked for them.




Fru Adelheid looked impatiently at her watch. She sat down, closed her eyes and pressed her forehead against the pane.

She thought how empty the house had been during the summer.

Cordt had not said a word about the old room, but, from the day when Finn had moved up there, things had altered between him and her. Something had happened…something indefnite and nameless, but none the less fateful on that account.

And, while Finn was abroad, this had grown between them…without their doing anything to further or prevent it. Neither of them thought about it. Both led their own lives and drifted farther apart in their yearning for their quiet child. The day was long for them, their rooms were cold.

But inside her was a growing anxiety for Cordt, who became ever more silent and wore such a melancholy look in his eyes.

A door opened and she sprang up:

“We shall be late, Cordt.”

“Not at all,”he said, calmly.“You ordered the carriage too early.”

“Let us go, Cordt. We may just as well wait there as here.”

Cordt sat down with his hat on his knee and looked at her. She stood with bent head and buttoned her gloves.

“Sit down for a moment,”he said and pushed a chair towards her.

“Do you want to talk to me?”

“Sit down, Adelheid,”he said, impatiently.“Sit down for a moment.”

Fru Adelheid leant against the chair and remained standing.

“It is long since we talked together, Adelheid…many, many years. Do you know that?”

She shrugged her shoulders:

“Very likely,”she said and made her voice as frm as she could.“We have peace now, you see.”

Cordt nodded. He drummed with his fingers on his hat andlooked out of the window:

“Yes…yes, no doubt. We are old, Adelheid. As old as can be.”

“Is that what you wanted to say to me?”

“I am afraid for Finn,”said Cordt.“He will come home as pale as when he went away, a poor dreamer by the grace of God. To-morrow, he will be sitting up there and staring out at the life he dare not live.”

“Yes…why should he be up in the old room?”

“It was he who asked me,”said Cordt, calmly.“I could not deny him his inheritance. He has the right to know the ground he sprang from.”

“And what then? Do you think you can bring the dead days to life again?”

“No,”he said.“I don't think that. I don't want that.”

He was silent for a little. She did not take her eyes from his face. Then he said:

“Finn can build himself a new house, if he likes. Or he can refurnish his ancestral halls. And put in plate-glass windows and wide staircases and anything that suits him and his period. But he must know and be thankful that the walls are strong and the towers tall.”

Fru Adelheid pushed back the chair she was leaning against:

“There does not appear to be room for a mother in your arrangement,”she said.

Her voice trembled, her eyes were large and angry. But Cordt rose and looked as calm as before:

“You went out of it, Adelheid. You did not wish to be there.”

She made no reply. She understood that he did not mean toconsult her, to ask her for her help…did not even want it.

“Adelheid…now that Finn is coming…”

“Yes?…”

“I am afraid for him, Adelheid. And I would ask you to be on your guard and do him no harm. I believe that sometimes you smother his poor, dejected spirit. The peace which you have gained may be good in itself and good for you…but he is young, you must remember. He is only at the start of life, he has no need for peace and resignation. What is a boon to you is death to him, perhaps…”

She took a step forward and raised her face close up to his:

“Now it has come to this, Cordt, that you think I am your enemy for Finn's sake.”

“You may become so,”he said.

“You will drive me to it, Cordt.”

He took her hand and held it tight when she tried to draw it away:

“No,”he said.“No, Adelheid. I only want to warn you.”





Chapter 16


The balcony-door was standing open, because they had forgotten to close it. But the weather was mild and there was hardly any wind. Now and again, a yellow leaf fell somewhere or other from the baluster. It began to grow dusk.

Fru Adelheid sat with her head in her hands and stared out before her.

Cordt's words kept ringing in her ears. She did not think either that Finn was as he used to be. He was restless, could not sit still, talked more than usual:

“Wherever I went, I found the fountain outside,”he said.“It followed me throughout my journey. There was not a rushing noise so strong but the fountain sounded through it nor a night so still but it came rippling and sang me home again to the old room.…I wonder, did one of the owners of this house set it up?”he asked.

“I don't think so.”

“Yes,”said Finn.“That must be it. I am sure of it. Perhaps it was the one who built the house. You see, it forms part and parcel of the old room…it sums it all up. If there was nothing else but the fountain, it would all be here just the same. I must ask father.”

She shivered with cold and Finn shut the door:

“We are chilly people,”he said.“Both of us. We are not like father. He laughed at me yesterday when I came down to his roomto say good-morning and wanted to shut the window.‘Don't, Finn,’ he said.‘The autumn air is bracing and healthy, it makes one young again…sit in the draught and don't be afraid, old man that you are!’”

“Yes, father is strong.”

Finn looked at her stealthily.

He had soon understood that his parents had drifted apart while he was abroad; and he suffered in consequence. He was as kind and affectionate to his mother as ever; but his thoughts were always harking back to Cordt, whatever they might be talking of:

“Father is so sad,”he said.

“I haven't noticed it.”

She colored after saying this. But Finn was not looking at her, scarcely heard her reply:

“It was strange, mother…out there, on my journey, ever so many times I had a feeling that I came upon father. Wherever I went, I would suddenly hear his voice…then he would be close to me, I walked with him, regulated my step by his and talked to him.”

He laid his head back in his chair and closed his eyes:

“Often it was as if he had been where I came and prepared everything for me, so that I saw him in every corner. Sometimes I felt that I must put off my departure until he came.”

“And did he come?”

“Always. Wasn't that strange?”

“Yes.”

Fru Adelheid thought the sound of his voice was different from ordinary. He did not look at her, as he was used to do…his thoughts were not with her.

“Where were you and father to-day?”she asked.

“We went out into the woods…a long way out. Father was silent, but not so bored as at home. It was so lovely out there…and so strange. One could hardly see a thing…for the leaves falling.”

“Yes,”said Fru Adelheid.

Then she bent over him to look into his face, which had grown thinner and paler during the time that he was away:

“Finn,”she said,“was I not with you…out there…when you were travelling?”

Finn smiled and nodded his head:

“You came in your letters,”he said.“That father never did. But you were mostly here at home, where I was longing to be.”

She thought it was strange that he did not take her hand when he said that.

And, suddenly, she became conscious that she was sitting in terror lest he should slip away from her.

What had she to hold him with, if anything seized him that was stronger than their quiet life in these hours…what had she, if he went…?

It seemed to her as though Cordt stood in the room and beckoned him out into the yellow woods, where the air was so bracing and good. And Finn leapt up with a joyful cry…they went away…and never looked back.…

She felt that Cordt was stronger than she and hated him for it. She sought for a weapon to defend herself. She wished that Finn, who loved her, would lie down before her, as he so often used to do, with his cheek against her hand. And she knew that he was not thinking of it.

She felt so wretched and so lonely that she grew frightened and called upon her old longing for the red happiness…if only it would come and take her, so that she might have something to set against him who had everything.…

“Sing to me, mother,”said Finn.

“Yes,”she said.

She crossed the room with a stronger step than usual. Her cheek was red and her eyes glowed. She took hold of the instrument with frm hands when she opened it. Finn noticed this and looked at her in surprise; but it was not light enough for him to make out her face.

Lovs't thou the peasant in his cosy cottage-nook ?

Thou shalt share bed and board with him, eating and sleeping;

Thou shalt tranquilly brew and merrily cook;

Dusty wheel, rusty needle thy care shall not brook;

Thou shalt bless sun and rain in God's keeping.

But she that loves none shall go weeping!



Lovs't thou the poet with harp all of gold?

Thou shalt list to his song o'er the loud strings sweeping;

Thou shalt meet him, where flowrets peep from the wold;

By thy smiles shall his going and coming be told,

His mind in thy joyfulness steeping.

But she that loves none shall go weeping!

Lovs't thou the lordling, who hunts in the grove?

Thou shalt sue to thy mother and fly from her keeping;

Thou shalt give him thy lips and give him thy love;

Thou shalt take, as he flings horse or hound from above,

Blows, fame and food flung to thee creeping.

But she that loves none shall go weeping!

Fru Adelheid remained sitting with bowed head.

The song had broken her pride. She trembled over all her body and great tears fell upon her hands. She had conjured up spirits which she could not lay; she felt more powerless and small than she had ever felt before.

She began to think of Finn and looked round in alarm. But he could not see her and she wept silently. She laid her forehead against the spinet…then her hand fell upon the keyboard and she started and rose from her seat.

“That was a strange song,”said Finn.

It was so still in the room that she could not bear it.

“I have not sung it for many years,”she said.“In the old days, I used to sing it often.”

“What was father like when you met him?”asked Finn.

She stood with her back to him and turned the pages of the music with trembling hands.

“Was he as handsome as now?”

“Yes…no.…I don't know if he was handsome.”

Finn listened.

“He was…he was charming.”

“That he was…that he was,”he said and clapped his hands like a child who is delighted with a story.“And then he was so masterful…was he not?…So that one was bound to follow him?”

“Yes,”said Fru Adelheid.

“Father was a king,”said Finn.

Her heart throbbed, she listened with all her senses. She felt that Finn was somewhere close to her and accomplishing something that would destroy her. And she could not turn round, could not go to him and beg him to desist.

“I could wish I had a brother,”said Finn.

“Do you feel lonely?”

“No…no, it is not that. But then he should have the kingdom.”





Chapter 17


At that time, Finn made a friend whom he had not chosen or wanted for himself, but whom Cordt gave him in his anxiety, because he thought he could never get any one better.

His name was Hans and they had known each other since they were children. He was a year older than Finn, not quite so tall, but more powerfully developed, with bright hair and eyes and disposition.

His father was a little man who sat among the people in the counting-house, where his father had sat before him. He and his little wife had no luck in life save their son. But at times they trembled for his future, because his ideas were so pronounced and took so wide a range.

For, even as he was taller than his father, so he would not be content with his measure in anything.

Above all, he did not want to sit in the offce, but to go out in the world, big as it was. And, from the time when he was a little boy, he believed that it was bigger than they told him.

Now that he had grown up and become conscious of his need and his powers and could not get anywhere, he went fearlessly to the master of the house and told him how the matter stood.

Cordt liked him and wanted to keep him for his house, but soon saw that he had nothing that could tempt him. He asked him what hewould like to be; and it appeared that Hans wanted to be an engineer.

Cordt looked at him and thought that his glance could blast rocks.

Then he promised his assistance and remained sitting in deep thought, while Hans went down the stairs singing.

Time passed. He advanced along his road and both he and the others could see that he was fully keeping pace with his dreams. Cordt did not lose sight of him and was pleased when he called. But Fru Adelheid did not like him, because he talked so loud and had such a heavy tread.

One evening, Cordt stood in Hans' room and talked to him as he had never talked to any one:

“I am your father's employer,”he said,“and my father was your grandfather's. My son will never be yours. For you mean to make your own way and be your own master. You would have done that even if no one had lent you a helping hand. That is true. But then you would have become bitter, perhaps, and distrustful and narrow-minded in the use of your strength. From this I delivered you. To-day, I come to ask for a return.”

Hans had taken the hand which he put out to him and stood ill at ease, without understanding. And Cordt sat down wearily and sat long without speaking further.

At last, he woke from his thoughts and looked at the young man, who could not interpret his glance, but was moved by it:

“I do not wish that you were my son,”he said.“I have a son and he is a good lad and I love him. He has not your strength of character, but then he does not need it. His path was smoothed and shaded from the day when he was born and grew up. But he can giveyou many things which you have not.”

He listened to his own words, to the way in which they kept on shaping themselves into an apology for Finn, a prayer for forbearance towards him. He suffered at this; and Hans, who saw his distress, felt, without understanding, that something important and tragic was taking place in this great house, where he and his had earned their living.

“Will you try if you can be his friend?”

Hans was quite willing.

Cordt looked at him and gauged his strength. He looked round in the little low-ceilinged room which contained nothing but what served Hans in his work. He looked out of the window, where the roofs intersected one another, dirty and grey against the sky: smoke rose from hundreds of chimneys, the noise of the courtyard and the street filled the room, the window was broken and pasted up with paper.

Then he again turned his eyes to the man who sat amidst these mean surroundings and grew up strong. And Cordt knew that he was not standing here as his benefactor and his father's employer, who was opening his rich house to him. He stood here as one who could beg and nothing more.

“You know you used to play together as children,”he said.

And, when he had said that, he was overcome with emotion, because he remembered that Finn had never played. Hans thought the same thing, but could not fnd the words that should be spoken on this occasion and the silence became heavy and painful to both of them.

To say something at all costs, Hans asked if Finn was ill.

Then Cordt understood that Hans must long since have pronounced his judgment on the pale, silent heir of the house and that the judgment could not be good.

He rose, tired of seeking for guarded phrases. He laid his hands on Hans' shoulders and looked at him in such a way that Hans never forgot it:

“Do you be David,”he said.“Come to us with your harp. And come of your own accord and come when we send for you.”





Chapter 18


The frst thing was that Finn had his former room arranged so that he and Hans could be there when Hans came to see him.

There was nothing said about it. For it was taken as a matter of course that no stranger should set foot in the old room. But Cordt at once thought that his hope in Hans was shattered.

Sometimes Finn was glad when Hans was there.

They could never talk together.

Hans' thoughts were constantly at work on plans and diffculties, the least of which seemed quite unsurmountable to Finn, and he had not the remotest idea as to what passed in his friend's brain. He talked to all men alike and his words were all questions or answers or opinions.

So it was Hans who spoke and, wholly taken up with himself as he was, he seldom noticed that Finn fell a-dreaming.

When Finn could get him to set to work on some calculation or other, he himself sat delighted and watched Hans while he struggled with fgures and drawings.

He was amused at Hans' wrinkled forehead, his eager, impatient movements. And he waited expectantly, like one sitting on a race-ground, or wherever else men are engaged in contest, for the shout with which the engineer would fling aside the pencil when the problem was solved.

Then Finn's face beamed with delight. He was as pleased as if it had been himself that had gained the triumph and he had no notion what sort of triumph it was or what it was worth.

But sometimes, and more and more frequently, Hans was too active, too restless for him.

There were days on which Finn hid when his friend called. Often, Hans' mere presence in the room occasioned him real bodily pain. He could feel half unconscious under his powerful glance, his voice, which was so loud and jolly, his words, which all meant something.

Then he sat tortured and wretched, because it was not possible for him to ask the other to go. And it was only seldom that Hans perceived this. When it did happen, there was no end to his awkward distress; and then Finn was not content before he had succeeded in persuading him that he was quite wrong.

Then Finn submitted, in the same way in which a hopeless invalid submits to a new cure which prepares new sufferings for him and in which he does not himself believe. And, while he suffered, he thought incessantly of his father, who suffered more than he did and whom he could not help.

His best time was when they were out together.

They drove and rode; and then they were never agreed, for Finn wanted to ride slowly and drive fast and Hans wanted just the opposite. They were always eager to accommodate themselves to each other, but this came to pass only when it was Finn's wish that prevailed.

Finn did not like going out. But, once he had started, he was glad; and then he always wanted to have Hans with him. He was shyin a crowd and his friend's presence reassured him.

They generally walked in the streets, for Finn felt cold if he went outside the town. Then he took Hans' arm and kept step with him and was proud of him. He liked to hear his strong voice through the noise of the street, his quick step, the tap of his stick on the pavement.

Then Finn would sometimes begin to talk.

Mostly of his travels. And he could speak of these almost as he thought and as he spoke to his mother. It was as though the life and the noise that half drowned his words made him feel freer and safer.

And, although Hans cared but little for what Finn had seen and talked about, still there was a color and a gleam about his words that captivated him.

But, when it happened that the noise in the street was suddenly stilled, then Finn was silent and frightened. And, if, for a moment, they were separated in the crowd and Hans failed to catch a sentence and asked him to repeat it, or seized upon some phrase and asked for a further explanation and confrmation, then Finn was forthwith tired and his mood changed.

He often stopped when a piece of street-life caught his attention. He pointed it out to his friend and made it the subject of his talk. Then Hans would underline his words with some racy observation or other, which amused Finn, but afterwards annoyed him, because it spoilt the picture for him.

They never talked about women.

Finn was silent, because his thoughts were vague and modest. And Hans' experiences were not of such a nature that he cared to talk about them. Then, also, they both had an instinctive feeling thatthey had less in common on this subject than on any other and that they did not wish ever to cross each other's path.

On one occasion only was Finn his friend's guest in his home.

It was a regular feast in the little rooms, high up under the roof, and Finn was glad to be there.

He looked in delight at the two little old people who stood and sat with folded hands and little bows and nods and did not know how to show their respect and gratitude to the young master of the house. They took it for granted, as a settled thing, that Finn must be vexed because Hans had broken with tradition and gone his own way and they made endless covert excuses for it.

And through the excuses rang their pride in the strong son whom they handled as cautiously as though he would fall to pieces if they took frm hold of him…their joyous dread of the greatness that awaited him.

Finn understood them and was touched by them. He sang his friend's praises and prophesied a preposterous success for him and was happy to read the gladness in the little parents' eyes.

And, while he was deep in conversation with them and amused at Hans, who was utterly confused that his friend should see the adoration of which he was the object, the picture of his own parents suddenly rose before his thoughts like great black silhouettes against the light background.

He stopped talking and then they all became silent and it was not pleasant in the room.

Afterwards, he stood with Hans and looked through the open window.

His eyes roamed over the hundreds of roofs. The sun shoneon the slates and the red tiles and lit up the telephone-wires. Little garret-windows stuck out on every side…with chintz curtains, with wall-fowers and geraniums and pelargoniums and yellow birds in white cages.

In one place there hung an elegantly-painted wooden box with ferns, which were quite brown, but stood proud and stiff, and a little fr-tree in the middle. In another, the curtain futtered right out into the air and waved and fapped like a fag. Here, two sparrows hopped about in the gutter…there, a caged bird was singing, shrilly and sweetly.

“How charming this is!”he said.

Hans did not exactly think so.

But, at that moment, Finn set eyes on a window a little to one side and so near that he felt as if he could reach across to it.

The window was open. There were fowers in it and there was a bird which hopped from perch to perch in its cage, silently and unceasingly. Behind the fowers sat a young girl sewing. He could see the back of her and a bit of her chin and hear the stitching of the sewing-machine:

“Look,”he said, in an undertone.

Hans came up and at once looked away again:

“That's Marie,”he said.“She's a seam-stress.”

There was nothing wrong either in the words or in the tone in which they were uttered. But he said it so loud and so carelessly that it hurt Finn. The girl opposite looked up and smiled.

Then something like a cloud passed over the whole picture, with the fowers and the bird and the sunny roofs. Finn sighed and came away from the window.

And, when they sat together at supper and had fnished eating, suddenly there fell upon him an insuppressible melancholy.

He looked from one to the other and read in their faces that they were subduing their gladness on his account. He imagined what it was like when the three were alone, busy and cheerful in their work and in their faith in one another.

And behind their kind words and smiles he felt the pity for their quiet guest. But he thought of this only as pity for Cordt and of himself as one who suffered blame.

Then he hurriedly took his leave.





Chapter 19


Hans and Finn were driving in the woods, when a little stray dog ran under the wheel and was badly hurt.

They both jumped out of the carriage. Hans knelt on the ground and took the gasping dog in his arms:

“Give me your pocket-handkerchief,”he said.

Not receiving it at once, he looked up, impatiently.

Finn did not stir.

He stood leaning over the dog and looking into its glazed eyes with a great, deep, strange glance. He was not thinking whether it was an animal or a human being, whether it could be saved or whether he himself could do anything.…

“Finn!”

He did not stir. He was staring into the great face of death. The door of the dark house was fung open and he stared and stared into the darkness. His soul was flled with a devout awe. He felt nothing, saw nothing, but life expiring before his eyes.

Hans looked at him speechlessly, terrifed at the expression in his face, which he did not know how to interpret, and grew more and more agitated.

“Give me your pocket-handkerchief, Finn.”

Finn started. He looked up and handed him the handkerchief:

“I didn't think of it,”he said.

Hans did not reply. In a little while, the dog was dead and he fung it in among the trees in such a way that Finn could have struck him.

They got into the carriage and drove on in silence. Finn thought of nothing but what he had seen and did not suspect his friend's agitation. Then, suddenly, he told the coachman to pull up:

“You mustn't mind, Hans,”he said.“I am going to get out.…I can go home by myself.…I want to be alone for a little.”

Hans jumped out of the carriage and walked away without saying good-bye. Finn took no notice. He let the coachman shut the door, shrank into a corner and drove home.

Fru Adelheid came to him in the old room and could not make him speak of what lay on his mind. She smiled to him and took his hand and sang for him.

But Finn sat silent and absent.




Some time after, the friends were walking, one evening, through the streets and along the canal, where the boats lay in a row and, on the other side, an old castle stood, with broken windows and charming green roofs.

“Let us sit here for a bit,”said Finn.

They sat on the quay. The water fowed black and angry beneath them. The boats rocked and bumped and swayed. Hans drummed with his cane against the embankment-wall:

“Is it like this in Venice?”he asked.

“No,”said Finn.“It's fner there. Because one's strange to it.”

Hans laughed gaily and Finn said nothing more and looked down into the water.

Then they suddenly heard a shout.

They both sprang up and ran and, when they had come some distance, they saw a child on the point of drowning:

“Here, Finn…help me.…”

Hans scrambled down into one of the boats and was fumbling with the oars. But Finn ran on and jumped into the water, where the child was, without a moment's refection.

He could not swim and Hans had frst to save him. Then, with the greatest difficulty, he rescued the child. They went home to Cordt's house and, when the frst fright was over and it became clear that Finn had suffered no harm, they all sat in the living-room and talked about it.

Fru Adelheid held Finn's hand between her own and patted it and pressed it. Cordt walked up and down in great emotion.

“How could you take it into your head?”said Hans.“You know you can't swim.”

“I never gave it a thought,”said Finn, quietly.

Cordt stopped in front of his son and nodded to him. Fru Adelheid kissed him on the forehead and her eyes beamed.

Hans looked at them, crimson with anger.

He thought of how Finn might have been drowned, or the child, or both of them. Then he remembered the scene in the woods, with the dying dog. He could not understand these people's train of thought and he despised it. He looked at none of them and, with an effort, forced his voice to be calm, as he said:

“One has no right to behave like that. It is stupid.”

“Yes,”said Finn.

But Cordt put his hand on the engineer's shoulder and lookedat him in such a way that Hans suddenly remembered his own little faint-hearted father:

“Yes,”said Cordt,“it is stupid that Finn shouldn't know how to swim.”




Then it was decided that Cordt's son should learn to swim.





Chapter 20


Fru Adelheid sat, book in hand, without reading.

It was late. Finn had been with her and had said good-night and Cordt was not at home. It was silent in the house and silent outside.

She had a feeling as though she were alone in the world.

Fru Adelheid was not happy.

The peace which the good grey years had brought had departed from the house. She could not see her way anywhere: not with Finn, not when she was alone, least of all when Cordt was in the room.

She did not feel safe even at church. It would happen to her that she left church heavier in mind than when she entered. It also happened that she simply dared not go in, but turned back, when the organ pealed to her in the porch.

She sat and stared, with her white hands folded in her lap. She wanted to try if she could think the thing out to the end. But she had tried before, with ever-decreasing success.

First, there was the going back to the old room.

This was the beginning and she could not but think that it was the whole matter, for, in truth, she had never got over it. She could not defend herself against the memories that came crowding one upon the other. Her blood grew hot, her eyes moist, without her knowing why.

She suffered from a constant terror which she could neitherexplain nor shake off. Now it was Finn, whose pale face frightened her. Now it was Cordt, who was silent and ever more silent and brooded over his thoughts.

Then she was overcome as by a despairing remorse and she could not see how she had offended. Then she went in a secret dread of revenge and she knew of no one who meant her any harm.

There were days on which every step she took gave a dull and threatening echo of the old days. She felt as though she were living in a house whose walls were full of secret recesses with old documents which would upset everything that existed, if they came to light…she felt as though she were walking over mysterious vaults that concealed the traces of mysterious crimes.

Wearily, Fru Adelheid leant her head upon her hand and let her hand fall again. She half rose in her chair and hid her face in the roses that stood on the table before her. She took up the book and put it down at once.

Then Cordt came.

He nodded to her, went to the farther side of the room and sat down with a book.

She looked at him timidly. She heard him turn the pages and wondered what book it was. She asked him. He answered, without looking up, and the silence increased twofold.

Fru Adelheid sighed and rose to go to bed:

“Good-night, Cordt.”

He closed the book and tossed it on the table. She stopped and looked at him. Then he asked:

“Has Hans been here to-day?”

She sat down in her chair again. He had got up and was pacingthe room. She waited and listened to his footsteps.

Then she could bear it no longer:

“Cordt!”

He stopped and looked at her.

“Cordt…Finn will die, if Hans is always with him.”

“Yes,”he said, softly and sorrowfully.“Finn will die and you will die and I shall die. But Hans will live.”

“What are you trying to do with him, Cordt?”

“Have you forgotten what I want?”

He looked at her and his eyes hurt her.

“I wonder if your wish is also mine, Cordt,”she asked.

“No.”

He said that calmly, without anger, but also without hesitation.

Then she leapt up:

“Your wish was never mine…never! You have been able to persuade me and frighten me and force me.…I never meant it, Cordt, never…even when I agreed.”

“Let the dead days be, Adelheid.”

“And now…Cordt.…Now I am farther away from you…now you understand me less than ever…there is something in me now that is a thousand times stronger than what parted us then.”

Cordt looked at her with a tempest in his strong eyes:

“So there is in me, Adelheid.”

He stood before her, drawn up to his full height. She thought he seemed taller than usual and his face looked strangely young.

“There is Finn,”he said.

Fru Adelheid sat in her chair, because she could not stand.

“You speak as if he were your son and not mine,”she said.

She did not take her eyes from his face. She could not get rid of the thought that he looked so young. His hair had not a sign of grey, his walk was easy and erect as in the old days, his eyes glowed with the same strength and the same confdence.

She bent forward and stared and sought. Surely she must be able to find the wounds which sorrow had given him, the marks which age had brought.

Cordt did not look at her. He stood with his hands folded about his neck and with strangely distant eyes:

“You have said it, Adelheid…it is as you say…there is something now that is a thousand times greater than what parted us then. We mortals always think, when misfortunes come, that no more will come now…that it must be over now. And so there is no difference between the child with its lost doll and the man with his dead love…none except time, which comes and goes, comes and goes, puts out a light and kindles a pyre and puts out the pyre also.”

He dropped his arms and stood silent for a while:

“Adelheid…”

He said no more. He looked round the room and at her, as though he were waking from his thoughts. Then he went to the window and looked across the square, where the lights were being put out.

Fru Adelheid stared with great fxed eyes at where he stood.

She had not seen him during many years…where had she been all those years…what had she been doing?

Then she had seen him again, distantly and dimly at frst, like the memory of a fght, a pain, on the day when she stood once more in the old room. He had come closer…the time he warned her aboutFinn. And, little by little, he had approached her through Finn…through his fears and his love, through his every word, constantly closer and more effectively.

She clutched the arms of the chair so frmly that her knuckles turned white.

Now it had come…now the doors of the mysterious cellars grated on their rusty hinges and the crime stood revealed…now the secret recesses in the walls were opened and the old documents bore witness to the right.…

Now there was no longer anything between her and him and there was nothing outside him and her. He stood beside her…she could reach him with her hands. She had no son and no God. His words swept over her like a storm, his eyes were bent upon her.…

She wanted to get up and run away, but could not. A sort of dizziness came over her and the ground retreated under her feet.

There were voices which told her that it was surely a very old and forgotten story…a legend preserved in the archives of the house for the entertainment and instruction of future times, which would possibly judge differently from the one who had set the legend down.

There were others, mocking and exultant voices, which whispered to her that it was all imagination and nothing else…that Finn belonged to her and not to him, that all his confdence and all his strength would break like glass against that pale, quiet boy, who loved his mother.

There were hymns and psalms and organ-pealing and impressive words about sin and forgiveness and Christ's heavenly glory. The cool air of the church-vault passed over her burningforehead…all the bells rang, as though for a soul in need.

She heard it all and it vanished like a sound in the air.

And all the voices were merged before her confused thoughts.

It turned into an evening in the old days…an evening of lights and gaiety. She saw the people of that time…she heard her own voice.…

Then, suddenly, it was quenched in the great silence of the old room.

The candles were burning on the mantelpiece.…She sat and stared into the red hearth. Now Cordt spoke . . .Cordt in the old days:

“I will stake life and happiness to win you. I will talk to you and importune you and conquer you. I will take you in my arms and close my door to you and run after you and forgive you. And, if I do not win you, I shall cast you off.”

She sprang up and clasped her head in her two hands:

“Cordt…Cordt…”

He turned round and looked into her white face.

She raised her face to him and sought and stared after her portrait in his eyes…only a thought from the old days…a memory…

It was not there. For him there was nothing in the world except that which was his happiness and his fear and his struggle…now as in the old days…

And it was no longer she.

“Adelheid…are you ill?”

“No…no…”

She laughed aloud. Cordt took her hands and led her to a chair.She let him do as he would and continued to look up in his face.

Then she suddenly thrust him from her.

She smiled and shook her head at her folly. She rose and walked round the room. She said she was quite well, told him to go away…just to go away.

And Cordt went.

She stared at the door, which closed after him, as though she had seen him for the last time. Then she turned round and looked into a mirror which showed her whole fgure.

Slowly she walked up to the mirror, sat down before it, with her head in her hands, and stared into her own face.

The clock struck one and two from the church-steeples and she did not hear. Then some one shouted down in the square. She rose, took a candle and left the room.

She went through the long passages and up the stairs, softly and carefully, as if she were a thief. She listened at Cordt's door and at Finn's. Then she stood outside the old room. She listened…there was no sound. She opened the door ajar and saw that it was dark.

She went in quickly and walked straight up to the secret recess in the wall. She opened it and took the yellow document in her trembling hands.

Then she stared at Cordt's name and her own, which were written down last and struck out again.





Chapter 21


Finn stood at the window in Cordt's room, with his head leaning against the frame, and looked down into the yard, where the porter's children were playing.

He had come, as usual, to say good-morning and Cordt had told him to wait while he fnished a letter. The letter had been sealed for some time, but Finn had not noticed it. He was watching the game down below and bending forward to see better.

Then the children were called in. He laid his head against the window-frame again and looked up at the grey sky. He thought of Hans, who had left for Paris that morning and was to remain abroad for two years.

Cordt sat silent. From where he was, he could see Finn's profle: the forehead, which was so white, the eyelids, which lifted themselves so heavily, the mouth, which was so tired and so weak.

“Finn!”

Finn started and turned round.

“Did you see Hans off?”

“Yes.”

Finn sat down by the window where he stood, with bent head and his hands upon his knees. He wound the cord of the blind round his fngers and unwound it again.

“I wonder if you will miss Hans?”

“Oh…yes.”

“I shall,”said Cordt.“Hans represents the new order at its fnest…the hero in modern poetry…the engineer, you know, whom they can never put on the stage without making him insipid…because he never acts a part. He is strong and has the courage to employ his powers. To us he often seems lacking in refnement and he fnds it diffcult to grant us our due. He has no ancestors…he is the ancestor…he founds a dynasty.”

“Yes,”said Finn.

They sat silent for a while.

There was no doubt in Cordt. He knew what he wanted and wanted it. He did not seek for kind words, but strong words. Finn knew this too. He sat like a culprit awaiting sentence and was thankful for every minute that passed.

Then they looked up into each other's eyes.

They measured each other's strength. And Finn was strong in his hopelessness, even as Cordt was strong in the hope which he could not let go, because he had nothing else to fall back upon.

“Do you know that you are a born artist, Finn?”

Finn smiled sadly and shook his head.

“You are,”said Cordt.“There is no doubt about it. When you were travelling abroad…there was simply nothing in your letters but delight at the pictures you saw. Your journey was one long progress through a royal gallery. At sea, in the street, on the mountains…everywhere you caught life and hung it on your wall and sat down to look at it.”

“Did I?”

“Had you not been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, youwould have been lost beyond redeeming. You would have become a painter…no…an author.”

“Would that be so bad?”

“What use is literature to us modern people?”said Cordt.“Where does it lead us? How does it form our lives? If the old poets had lived nowadays, they would certainly have been merchants, or electricians, or arctic navigators.…Just look round you, Finn…the books we read, the pictures we look at, the plays they perform: isn't it all like an orchestra that plays for an hour while people walk about the grounds? Tired people, who like to hear a bit of music before they go to bed. The band plays its tune and gets its pay and its applause and we are interested in seeing that the performance is well and properly given.…But…the poet, Finn…A solitary horn sounds over the hills. We drop the plough and listen and look up, because the notes seem to us so rare and so powerful and we have never heard them before and know them so well. Then our eyes glisten. And the sorrow that bent our back and the gladness that held us erect and the hope we had…all of that suddenly acquires color and light. And we go whither the horn calls us…over the hills…to new green felds where it is better living.”

“Father . . .”

Finn raised his head, but then could not fnd the phrase for what he wanted to say.

“Don't you think that the poet must be a man…a man like the others, with courage in his breast and a sword at his thigh? Then he goes forth and sings them to battle and wedding, to dance and death. He is a part of the business, foremost in the crowd.”

“The poets also sat in the ladies' chambers and sang,”said Finn.Cordt nodded:

“They did that also,”he said.“But the poets we now have do nothing else. There will always be fddlers as long as there are idle women and women with two husbands and wars and kings. As long as the stars wander so far through the sky and the children cannot catch the bird that flies in the bush.…But never mind that, Finn. Never mind that. Just look at those who sit in the orchestra today.…Would you sit among them? They are sick people singing about their sickness. One is sick with love and one with lewdness and one with drink. One chants his faith on vellum, another sells his doubts in sixpenny editions. The feeble will of the one quavers in silly verses…the other intoxicates his pale fancy with blood and horrors drawn from the olden times. Do you think that a free man would of his own accord select his place among those artists?”

Finn looked up with his quiet eyes:

“Who is a free man, father?…Are you?”

Cordt put his hands on Finn's shoulders and bent over him and looked at him:

“You are, Finn.…You are a free man…if you wish to be.”

“Father…”

Finn put out his hands like a child asking for something. But Cordt looked at him inexorably. And so strong and radiant was his glance, that Finn tried to escape it, but could not; tried to speak, but was silent.

Then Cordt walked across the room, up and down, with great, calm strides, and spoke and was silent and never for a moment released his son from his stern grasp.

His words seized Finn and lifted him up where things weregreat and beautiful and bitterly cold, he thought; then let him fall again, till he relapsed into his own dark corner; and seized him anew and carried him aloft.

But, when Cordt ceased, it was to Finn as though he heard a flourish of trumpets from the clouds proclaiming that other words were now coming, greater still and austerer, more loving, ever heavier to bear.

“You are right, Finn.…I am not a free man, I never was. I am bound up in the tradition that built my house and bore my race and, when I could not support the tradition, things broke for me. But that did not make me free.…Those were heavy days, Finn. I could not understand it, you see, and I fought to the end. I was young and strong and I was in love. You are fond of the old room…you can hear the legends up there singing their powerful, melancholy song.…Remember, Finn, I am one of those on whom the legend is laid. I have lived in the secrecy of the old room.…I have stood, in my calm, proud right…up there, where the room stood, unseen by any one except the master of the house and his wife…always remote and locked and hidden in its time-honored might…always open to him who owned it.…I left it like a beaten man. But I could not retire into a corner and mourn, for I had you, Finn. You were only a little child then, so I could not know how your paths would go. I knew only one thing, that you would never sit with your wife up there, where people became so small when they sat down in the big chairs and where it was so pleasant and so safe. I was the last. With me, the tradition of the old room was fnished.…Then I had to try if I could find my way in the world which I did not understand. I had to go through all that which I disliked so desperately and which had killedmy happiness. For myself, I had nothing to gain: I was a bound man and a wounded. But I had you, Finn.…And I had to know if they were building properly and honestly somewhere behind all the dancing and firting and singing which I saw before my eyes. Or if it was no different from what my eyes saw and if I should not be doing best to carry my child out into the mountains and let the wild beasts tear it to pieces.…I was alone in this. Your mother went to live in an old house beside the old house where her happiness could not grow. There she found peace. But I needed no refuge. Where I was, I was at home: I only wanted to see the place where you and your children should flourish.…I did not spare myself, Finn. I sought honestly, south and north, east and west. I took their books…the light ones burst like soap-bubbles in my hands and the powerful ones my thoughts had to struggle to understand. Not one of their green visions but has been with me in my room, not one of their bright swords but has flashed before my eyes.…I did not allow myself to be blinded by my own bitterness, or tricked by catchwords, or frightened by abuse. I went on as long as I could see the way…and longer, Finn. I peered out into the farthest, where those who thought as I did saw nothing but horror and insanity…. And Finn…I don't know.…Perhaps it was your mother's God that helped me…perhaps it was my ancestor, who himself had sailed into harbor and raised our house on new ground for many a good, long day. Perhaps it was your little hand, which lay so trustingly in mine, when you used to come to me in those anxious, lonely days and say good-morning and good-night.…I don't know. I daresay it was my love for you that lifted me above myself. I climbed as high up the mountains as a mortal can climb. It all lay under my feet like a cloud…longingand happiness and daily bread and daily trouble. I could not see the valley in which my house was built. But out of the cloud, over the mountain, I saw the road where we hustle and strive, generation after generation, ever forward towards the goal which we cannot see, but which is there, because the road is there.…And I saw land…the promised land of you and your children…from the mountain where I stood. A land I did not know…a land strange to my eyes…people with other habits and other beliefs, with a different form of love and a different code of honor.…I saw it through the storm that fung the door of the old room wide open.…That was a strange time, Finn…the strongest in my life and the happiest.”

Cordt stood at the window with his arms crossed over his chest. He looked at his son and smiled sadly. Finn sat still, with his head thrown back in his chair and his eyes closed.

“Then I equipped you for the journey, Finn.…I did not show you this way or that, for I was a bound man and could not go with you. I gave you books and masters, who opened all the gates of the world to you. I let you look into the mist where you wanted to ride. I feared nothing, because I wanted nothing for myself and because I had seen through the mist.…You grew up and I saw that you grew good and clever. Then I sat down and waited and longed for the day when I should wave to you from the balcony of my old house, when you marched forth to conquer your new land.…I was right to wait for the day.…Ah.…I have seen them, the poor devils, hungry and wounded, rush blindfold towards the new, which they did not know, because it could not possibly be worse than the old. I have heard them call for new laws because they had violated the old…they were driven from their huts and sat on the deck of the emigrant-shipwith their bundle and their uncertain hope for a better fate in the new world.…But you.…You had done no wrong and had nothing to revenge. Free as a king's son, you rode over the bridge with your retinue and rode through the world and planted your banner wherever you chose to dwell. Born of your mother's longing for excitement…in your father's house, whose walls are as thick as the walls of a castle…with the strong air of the old room in your lungs and without its yoke upon your neck…a rich and spotless nobleman, taking his place of his own free will in the ranks of the revolution.”

He was silent. His steps sounded heavily through the stillness:

“Are you with me, Finn?”

“Yes, father.”

“Come.”

Finn rose. Cordt put his arm over his shoulder and they paced the room together.

“I had so many dreams, Finn. And I gained such confidence, because my own happiness was shattered and I had you. I had become an old man, but my mind was not blunted. I had suffered shipwreck, but I was not afraid of the sea. I believed in life…in God, if you like.”

They did not walk well together and Cordt removed his arm. Finn sat down in his chair again and listened. Cordt went on walking:

“Then came the days which you know…the days of the present.…You grew up into the quiet man you are. Your eyes looked heavily upon life, you shrank back timidly when you saw that there was fre and smoke on earth.…You kept your scutcheon untarnished, but that is easily done, when one doesn't fight. Youwere never in places where one does not wish to be seen…that is true. But you never went outside your door, Finn…never. There was no fire in your blood, no desire in your thoughts. You were tired, Finn…merely tired.…I grew frightened for you…. As the years passed, you had become more to me than a son. You were not only flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone…you were a link in the human chain that goes on through the ages, ever onward. Your hand was in mine, but your life was more precious than mine. For you had to carry a greater burden and to carry it into new ways.…Remember, Finn, I had been on the mountain and seen through the mist. It was more than the question of an inheritance, more than family pride and family loyalty. You and I were allied in a great cause. And I sat with the map before me and followed the course of the battle…like an old soldier, who can no longer sally forth himself, but who has his son and his colors and his emperor under fre.…Remember how I had arrived at where I was. Remember what I had lost, what I had let go, how completely I had sacrifced myself for you. I had you, Finn…had I anything else ?…When I, then, became frightened for you, I plunged into my wonderful treasure and endowed you lavishly. I told you the legend of the old house and thought it would call you to arms, like the blast of the bugle over the camp. I revealed your father's and your mother's fate to you, that you might see how people fight for happiness. I sent you out into the world, where life is bigger and stronger than at home, so that life might make you into a man.…But never…never did I put any constraint upon you. Never did I usurp the place of Providence…. And you turned over the pages of the picture-book and came home paler than before and wearier. The old room was merely a charmingpoem to you, that sang you into deeper dreams. Up there…where the strong men of our race met their wives, when the sun went down upon the business of the day, and talked gladly and earnestly when their hearts impelled them to…there you sit, alone, all day long, with your slack hands.”

Then he laid his hands firmly on Finn's shoulders. And Finn looked up with moist eyes and quivering mouth.

“To-day, Finn, I have given you your inheritance. From to-day, I look upon you as of age. You were such that one could not use coercion with you…and, in fact, there was none that wanted to use it. Nor could one be angry with you…you were the same…it was the same…always. To-day, that is past. Go out and buy yourself a house and take a wife and have children by her. And remember that, if there were some in the family that fell, there was none that finched.”

“Father…I understand you…but I cannot do what you want.”

Cordt took a step back and tossed his thick hair from his forehead:

“You pale people understand everything, because no faith blinds your eyes: you are so kind and clever, you think. You judge leniently, you do not judge at all, you know that the truth is nowhere and everywhere. You justify every silly thought you have entertained…you sit for all time and contemplate your navel…and then you let the murderer go and the thief escape. God help you poor wretches! The stupidest, the most ignorant dervish is cleverer and kinder than you!”

Finn wanted to say something, but Cordt made a preventive gesture with his hand:

“A man must not understand everything. He must choose and judge and reject. If he doesn't do that, there is no happiness in the world and no loyalty and no peace. And, if he cannot hate, he cannot love either.”

He went to the window and looked out. And, as he stood there, Finn came up to him and seized his hand and looked at him pleadingly:

“I can't do what you want,”he said.

But Cordt withdrew his hand and moved away from him:

“You have no right to say that to me, Finn. I won't listen to it. For what I want is only that you should live. Take the inheritance which I have given you and use it as you can. One day, you shall be called upon to answer for your son, as I to-day for you.”

Finn smiled sadly:

“I shall never have a son,”he said, softly.

Cordt did not hear what he said. He was struggling with a memory…passed his hand over his face and stared before him. He saw Fru Adelheid…that evening in the old room, when she had said what Finn was saying now…the same hopeless, impotent words:“I cannot do what you want.”

He sat down and fell back in his chair.

All the despair of the old days came over him like a tremendous weariness. He was struggling against what was stronger than himself. He had nothing to set against that eternal, hopeless,“I cannot do what you want.”

Then he sprang up and stood in front of Finn with blazing eyes:“If it's your mother who paralyzes your will, then fy from her, hate her, thrust her from you…”

“Father…father…”

“Hate her, I say. She was smitten with the pestilence from her youth. She understood everything…like you. To her nothing was small or great, nothing near or far. Her will was gone, like yours. She knew where the glory lay, if she could reach it, but she could not. She hearkened to the times and the times made her their own. She was always sick…sick unto death.”

He crossed the room and said nothing more.

They were both of them very pale and both longed to be alone. They had nothing more to say to each other.

And Finn was not angry on his mother's account. He thought only of the one thing, that he could not do what Cordt wanted and could not appease his sorrow…could not even tell him that he loved him. And then he longed to sit still…in the old room…with his mother, who was so pretty and whom he had never offended:

“Are you angry with me, father?”

Cordt looked at him long and intently.Then he said:

“Yes.”

But, when Finn was gone, he sat with his face buried in his hands and wept.





Chapter 22


Cordt entered, dressed to go out, and hurriedly crossed the room.

Fru Adelheid sat writing. She looked up, as he came in, and went on writing.

“Where is Finn?”

“Upstairs, I suppose…in his room,”she answered, without looking at him.

He stood at the window for a moment. Then he fung himself into a chair and got up again and stood by the table at which she was sitting:

“Have you been with him to-day?”

“No.”

She closed her blotting-book and turned her chair so that her face was in shadow. Then she said:

“Finn is too much alone.”

“Yes.”

He nodded and said yes again; then stood with his head bowed deep in thought.

“It is so quiet here,”said Fru Adelheid.“You are not happy and Finn notices it. And Hans is away.…”

“Yes…yes…”

She crossed her arms over her breast and sat silent and lookedat the tip of her foot.

“Adelheid…”

Cordt drew himself erect:

“We will fll the house with gayety,”he said.“We will go and pay visits tomorrow morning…you and Finn and I…to old friends and new. We will have young and cheerful people here and pretty women and clever men…lights and music.”

She looked up at him. He smiled and put his hand on her shoulder.

“Yes,”she said.

Cordt talked about it a little and then went out hurriedly.

Fru Adelheid remained sitting long. The room grew dark. The lamps before the gateway were lit and their fickering gleams danced on the ceiling. The fire in the hearth smouldered under the ashes. Where she sat, no light fell; her white dress shone faintly through the gloom.

She thought of Cordt's smile…he had said that to her much as though he were asking one of the people in the offce to take pains in a diffcult matter.

She thought of Finn, who looked at her with such strange eyes, as though the relations between him and his mother had changed and he could not understand it.

She thought of herself. She felt like a tree in autumn, when the leaves fall… a tree that had always thought itself green and beautiful until now, when it saw its glory futter before the wind.

And, day after day and every hour of the day, she rebuilt it all as it might have been.

She built up the temple of the old room again and locked thedoor with seven seals. She put time back and sat with her little boy in her lap and resented old Marie's undressing him and singing him to sleep. She put time forward and celebrated the day when Finn should lead his wife into the secret chamber of the house and tell her all about it, in all its beauty and solemnity, and write his name and hers on the yellow document.

Fru Adelheid smiled sadly.

She thought she was like the man who had put the celestial globe up there in the old room…the man whose intellect was obscured and who sat and played with the stars until he died.

But her thoughts always went the same way, while the darkness fell ever closer about Cordt's house.

She wondered, would it be any use now, if the house were flled with lights and gayety? Or would the darkness lurk in every gloomy corner and spring forth when the feast was over and for ever hide the three who moved about the house, each his own way, anxiously and alone?

She did not know. But she always thought of it. And there was nothing tempestuous in her hope and in her fear and in her regret.

Fru Adelheid was calm now, always.





Chapter 23


Then the stately house on the square was lit up with gayety.

The horses trampled in the gateway and the servants ran up and down the carpeted stairs. The great drawing-rooms streamed with lights and fowers and music and the foor was flled with dancers.

It was a wealth and splendor even greater than in the old days, for now the master of the house was a more lavish host than he had ever been before. He could never have things fne enough, luxurious enough. He saw to everything, was everywhere and moved among his guests so that they could see that he delighted in them.

The entertainments at Cordt's house became legendary. And all that were rich and beautiful and noble and intelligent came when he invited them and came gratefully and were glad to stay.

The men gathered close about the lady of the house, who was charming in her white gown, with her white hair.

Those who had paid her their homage in the old days raised their grey heads when she passed them and followed her tall fgure with a gleam of their youthful fre in their eyes. And those who were now young wondered when they heard the old ones tell that she was once a thousand times prettier.

Or not prettier, perhaps. But such that every man on whom her eyes fell was, from that moment, hers and that every glance she vouchsafed was remembered for all time.

Now she was more remote in her smiles. Her glance was deeper, but it was as though it did not see. Her red mouth no longer promised happiness as it used to. Any one would think it a happiness to win her. But no one would believe it possible.

And, while they saw her thus in the light of their youth, they wondered what could have happened in the years that had passed and why the house had so long been closed and why it had now so suddenly opened its doors wide to the world which holds revel daily.

But their thoughts never grew to the shadow of a slander.

They asked her to sing. And, as she sat at the piano and looked through the room with her great, strange eyes, the old friends of the house remembered the glowing songs of her youth, which had set their blood afame as she exulted and wept in them with desire and love.

But now, when she sang, the young ones listened, enraptured with her voice, which was so bright and so clear and so wonderfully still:

The wildest water on earth to-day

(God grant me His grace consoling!)

Flows deep and dreary through gorges grey,

But whither and whence they alone can say

Who first set its wild waves rolling.



For no ship ever its tideway knew,

Its marge bore never a blossom.

And never a bird from the beaches flew,

And never a mirrored star it drew

From Heav'n to its own black bosom.



It wells from eyes that are glazed with pain

(God shield me in all disaster!)

When a man has rent like a rag in twain

His own life's bliss, by his own hand slain,

Being never his fortune's master.

There was a brief silence when she ceased. Then they crowded round her in admiration and with endless requests for more.

Fru Adelheid rose. She talked and smiled and thanked them. But her glance wandered far beyond all these people, who meant nothing to her, to Cordt, who stood at the far end of the room and was talking to some one and did not see her and had not heard her.

But Finn had heard her. And Finn had seen her great, humble, plaintive look.

He did not take his eyes off her and strange thoughts hurried through his head. He now understood what had happened in this house. He knew why Fru Adelheid had come to him so seldom, lately, in the old room. Why she had sat so silent, steeped in distant thoughts…why her glance had been so uncertain and so timid, her words so wavering, her hand so slack in his.

And he felt that the last bond was broken that bound him to mankind.

He had lost his mother, now that he was pushing hardest towards her. When she came to him now, it was Cordt she looked for. Were he to go to her now and lie down before her with his cheek on her hand, as he had so often done, she would lift him up and bidhim go out into the world and live.

He had a feeling as though he had been betrayed, but, at the same time, he wept with her in his heart. He looked at his father and thought how much more of a man he was than she suspected in her poor, tardy repentance. He looked at his mother and felt a curious loving contempt for her…such as men feel for a woman who comes to them and begs for something a thousand times less important than what she once possessed and despised.

Then he had to go into the crowd of people, who offered him their smiles and asked for his.

And so strong was the feeling of loneliness in him that he mingled readily with the guests of the house and was more cheerful than usual and more talkative.

He was as pleased to move about these bright rooms as elsewhere, because he was no longer at home anywhere. He might just as well exchange a few words with these smartly-dressed ladies and gentlemen, since he had to talk and since he could no longer tell any one what was passing within him and since no one could tell him what he wanted to hear.

The women crowded round him as the men did round Fru Adelheid. They wound a circle of white arms and bright eyes round the young heir of the house, who was so pale and so handsome and such that women longed for that which he did not show. They met him with charming, fattering words and smiled upon him and he did not hear the words and broke through the circle without a trouble and without a sigh.

The men offered him their friendship and he shook their hands and talked to them and went away and forgot their faces. Cordtfound him in every corner, where he had hidden for a moment without intending to or thinking about it, and carried him smilingly and teasingly and jestingly into the throng. And he smiled to his father and went with him and remained always alone.

He saw himself and only himself. He seized upon every thought that arose in him and discussed it as if it had been thought by another. He contemplated every mood that welled up in his soul as if he had read it in a book.

He climbed high up the peaks upon which men cannot live…the peaks whence they topple down one day or where they perish in the bright frost. For there is no sound up there and no air, no day and no paths. Only light and always light.

But, when it happened that Cordt's glance fell upon him, without his knowing it, the loneliness was suddenly extinguished in his soul.

Then he knew who he was and where he was and the pain of life gnawed into his soul. For he constantly read the eternal, hopeless, fond question in his father's eyes. He realized what he had forgotten, that the house was making holiday for his sake and his sake alone. Every strain that sounded, every rose that blushed, every pretty woman who moved across the foor: they were all his father's servants, who came to him with message after message that life's banquet was served if he would but take his seat at the board and drain its golden cup.

Then he thought sadly of his tranquil, beautiful mother, who had gone from him, out into life, which did not touch him. How good it would have been if they could sit together now and talk and be silent, while the fountain rippled in the square and the queerthings in the old room whispered their strange and mighty legend!

It would have been good for him. And good for her, he thought. And best of all, perhaps, for Cordt, who did not see her.

His thoughts gathered in love for Cordt, who was struggling to the death in his hopeless fght. He felt as though his father were a hero in the wars and wished that he were his meanest page to buckle on his armor for him and bathe his wounds and sit beside him with his lute, when he would sleep.

But the rout ran its course and it was late before the gate closed behind the last carriage.

It fell heavily and harshly as though it were striking angrily at the guests' heels. It grated its hinges long and shook its bolts as though it thought of never opening again, but of shutting out the world for ever from that old house, in which no light could drive away the increasing gloom, no joyous trumpets drown the hoarse voices that threatened in the corners.

Then they sat together for a while longer, they three who dwelt in the house, and talked with empty words and empty eyes.

Fru Adelheid it was who frst ceased, because her thoughts were the strongest. And Finn it was who said the most…as though to expiate the fault that oppressed him.

But it was Cordt who was bitterest in his care, while indifferent words passed between those who stood as close together as it was possible for mortals to stand and who feared the silence and who had nothing more to say to each other.

Then Cordt said good-night and Finn. But Fru Adelheid told the servants to leave her for a little and the candles burnt where the rout had been.

Restlessly she wandered about the room and again thought of the days that were gone and could never return. And she readily surrendered herself to her fancies, for there was in her now but one hope and one faith and one repentance.

She fancied that one of the long evenings was over in which gay acquaintances flled her rich house and Cordt and she exchanged glances which only they understood.

She had been to the nursery and leant over her little boy, who was sleeping with red cheeks. Now she would take the reddest fower there was and then go up the secret stair…up to where the old room stood, in its wonderful glory.

There he sat and waited for her.

She saw him as she entered…he raised his face to her and nodded and then lapsed again into his heavy thoughts. And she stood silent at the window, where the red fowers blushed before her feet and the square lay below her in the darkness of the night and the fountain sang its refrain, which never begins and never stops.

Then she rose and crossed the room. She heard his voice when he talked to her, as he so often talked…ever the same judgment upon the dance that passed over the world, the same mighty song in praise of great marriage, the same passionate, loving prayer that she would only see it while there was yet time and let those dance who had nothing better to do and take the proud place which he offered her by his side…in the old chair, in which people became so small and so strong, because they sat with their feet on an altar that was raised in faith and built up of faith and fenced in with faith throughout the changing times.

Then, when he had said that and sat by the chimney, where thefre glowed and the candles shed their rays sparingly in the corners of the old room…she would stand for a little at the window, while all was silent in the room, and look at him, who was the man in her life and had never ceased to be so. And then she would go up to him…slowly and quietly, because she honored the ground she trod on…kneel down where he sat and raise to him the eyes whose beauty he had loved, whose glance he had sought in such great hope and such great fear.

Then she would tell him exactly how it was…how strong it was and how silent:

“Cordt…you strong, you irresistible man…I love you as you would be loved. I thank you, because you talked to me and never grew weary. Because you always besought me. Because you waited for me and trusted that the day would come when the silence of the old room should turn to gladsome song in my soul and all the other sounds in the world like a distant buzz in the woods. Now I am here…Cordt…you strong, you irresistible man. Now I am yours, as I was before, and I am yours in the old room. There is nothing threatening or gloomy now in the strange things up here from the vanished days. I can sing to the old spinet so that no strings snap and no memories are mortally startled, for I sing only of you and of my boy and of my happiness. I can cherish the thread upon great-grandmother's spinning-wheel because I have woven the cloth of happiness in my own room. I can lovingly hide the wax doll in the folds of the curtain, because I have lived to see the day when I went gladly and readily to the secret chamber of the house and sat there long and was contented…But the jar with the naked man writhing through thorns: I set that up here when I was not yet what I am.It shall stand here in memory of the evil time that pulled at Fru Adelheid's soul and lured her desires with sounds from the square outside.…And our little boy, who sleeps with red cheeks, shall grow to man's estate and come up here one day, when you and I are dead, and sit with his wife in the chairs in which we sat. Then he shall know that his mother was tempted, it is true, but not destroyed.”

Fru Adelheid sat in her corner and dreamt in the silent, empty rooms.

Her white gown spread over the foor about her feet. Her eyes shone.




But high up, on the balcony of the old room, stood Finn and stared into the night that stretched round about him like a waveless sea.

It was silent. He did not think, did not dream. His soul mingled with the darkness, which was not evil and not good…only silent.

He was like a dead man who had been put on guard on the brink of the tower and who still stood there, staring with glazed eyes. The fountain rippled…it was as though the water rose over the edge of the basin and would rise and rise until it reached the dead man up there and washed him away.

Then a man came across the square.

He walked and sang, until he set eyes upon the man who stood up there, high and dark and motionless. Then he stopped and looked at him and shouted something.

And the man on the balcony answered with a shout. And the man below was seized with fear and ran away and vanished in the darkness.





Chapter 24


Cordt looked into the room where Fru Adelheid sat:

“Where is Finn?”

“I think he's in the old room.”

Cordt closed the door and walked quickly down the passage. She was sitting by the window and saw him in the square below, where he stood and looked up at the house. Then he walked away, in such a manner that she could see that he had no object for his walk.

The servant came and lit the candles. Fru Adelheid sat down by the freplace with her hands in her lap and listened for a sound in the quiet house.

Soon after, Cordt came home.

She heard his voice in the passage. Then he went into his own room…now he was outside again. She understood that he was on his way to Finn; but the next moment he came in to where she was sitting and sat down at a distance from her:

“Have you been up to him to-day, Adelheid?”

“No.”

Cordt moved restlessly in his chair, rose to go and sat down again. Fru Adelheid struggled with herself not to go over to him and take his hand and talk to him. Then he said:

“He has been so odd, lately. Brighter than usual, but more absent, nevertheless. He is not shamming, but still he is not himself.”Cordt went on talking about it, without looking at her and not so much in order to tell it to her as because he could not keep silent. She saw this exactly and turned away her face and cried quietly. Then he asked:

“Haven't you noticed it?”

“I think he is much as usual.”

Cordt rose and crossed the room. He stood for a time by the chimney, where she sat, and stared into the fire. She looked up at him with bright, moist eyes. Then he went over and sat where he had been sitting before and it was silent in the room.

“I wonder, oughtn't you to go up to him, Adelheid?”

He could not hear her reply and looked across at her. She had stood up and was coming towards him. He saw that she was very pale and that she was crying, but did not think about it and forgot it again at once.

Then she sat by him…so close that her white gown lay over his feet. She crossed her hands in her lap and parted them again and did not look at him while she spoke:

“Cordt…”she said.

And, when she had said that, she began to tremble and pressed her hands together.

“Yes?”

“You ought to go up to him, Cordt.”

He was silent for a moment. Then he bent closer to her and lowered his voice, as though there were some one in the room who could hear what he was saying and must not:

“I dare not. I have frightened him. He starts when he sees me…he stands outside my door and collects his courage when he comesto me to say good-morning. I will go quite away from him for a little while…go for a journey, I think, until he becomes more tranquil.”

She looked at him and pictured him roaming round the world so that Finn might recover his tranquillity. She saw him strolling in distant towns, where life fowed on around him, alone, knowing no peace, ever thinking of his son…longing for the day when he could come home, dreading how he would fnd him then.

Fru Adelheid slipped from her chair and lay on the foor before him, with her cheek against his hand and her eyes streaming with tears.

Cordt did not see. He stared into the room across her head, with the strained, racked look which he now always wore when he was alone:

“He does not like our parties, Adelheid,”he said, meditatively.“We only did him harm.”

“Yes.”

“But, if you would go up to him, Adelheid…very quietly…and sit with him a little, so that he could not give way to his thoughts. Or help him, so that his thoughts could find utterance. You two always got on well together, you know, and he was glad to see you whenever you came.”

“He is no longer glad to see me, Cordt.”

He looked at her in surprise and encountered her moist glance.

“If I went up now, Cordt…I could not sit with Finn as I used to. For I am no longer the same.”

“Ah, well!”was all he said.

He spoke calmly and indifferently, as though he had had no particular faith in his remedy and must look round for somethingelse.

“Cordt!…”

It was a scream.

He started. And, as if he had now first seen that she was kneeling before him, he pushed back his chair and rose to his feet.

He crossed the room and then came back and stood and looked at her with a sense of dislike that increased every minute. She crept to the chair from which he had risen and laid her head on it. She closed her eyes before his glance and wept silently and without stopping.

“You…?”he said slowly.

She received the blow which the word gave her without breathing a sound. Once she opened her eyes and immediately closed them again. Pale and still she lay before his feet.

Then his eyes blazed with anger and scorn:

“What a number of years have passed since we two frst met, Fru Adelheid…what a number of miserable years!”

“Yes,”she said and raised her head for a moment and laid it on the chair again.

“You went away…in search of your red happiness. You were not content with your husband, whom you loved and who loved you…you must have all men on their knees before your beauty…you must needs see the desire in their eyes and their unchaste hands cramped because they dared not lay them upon Cordt's wife.”

“Yes,”she said.

“Well, did you fnd the lover who bound your will to his foot? And did he spurn you when he had seen to the depths of your charming eyes? Or did you leave him of your own accord…and gofarther out into the world…in search of that which was greater still and redder?”

“I had no lover,”she said, in a low voice.

He tossed back the hair from his forehead and clenched his fsts:

“No,”he said.“You did not. That is your disgrace and your judgment.”

“Cordt…Cordt…suppose I had had…”

“Yes…if you had had a lover and were here to-day, then I should take your hand and lead you to our son and say to him,‘Here is your mother, who has been unhappy. She loved your father and her love died when the man came who was more to her than he. She has not known a really happy day in all these years, because her fate was too strong for her. Now she has come to ask for your affection and needs it.’”

He crossed the room and then came and stood by her again:

“Get up, Adelheid.”

She rose from the foor and sat down in her chair again, with her white hands crossed in her lap, silently and quietly. He looked at her and it was as though her humble obedience added to his anger:

“Where did you go on the day when you broke the bonds of your marriage, because the air in the old room was too pure for you and too strong? Where have you been since?”

“I went to God.”

Cordt laughed:

“Show me your God.”

He bent over and looked her in the face:

“I don't believe in your God,”he said.

She did not take her eyes from his and stretched out her trembling hands to him and her red mouth quivered with weeping:

“Then I don't believe in Him either, Cordt.”

He turned away from her. Quietly she bowed her head, her tears fell upon her hands, she listened and moaned under the blows which she had received and longed for more.

But Cordt sat at the window and looked out where the rain came pouring down and the fame of the lamps fickered in the wind. His anger was over. He could not remember what they had been talking of. His thoughts were where they always were and all the rest was nothing.

Then he suddenly stood by her again and struck his hand on his temples and looked at her with fear in his eyes:

“Adelheid…do you think Finn won't come to us at all to-night?”

She understood that it was too late…irremediably, hopelessly too late. She would never be able to tell him what was burning in her soul. He would never know that she did not come, because she was weary and because she was afraid, but that she had honestly wiped out the bad years of her life and stood again as he would have had her the time…the time he wanted to have her thus.

“He will come and say good-night,”she said calmly.

Fru Adelheid raised her folded hands to her mouth.

Things could not remain thus for ever. But she could wait. She could go barefoot over the stones, if only once she reached a place in his house where she could stay. There must be a road somewhere that led to him.




And the evening sped on.

She sat beside him again and held his hand in hers, happy that he allowed her to keep it. She wanted to push his hair off his forehead, where the wrinkles lay so sharply marked, but did not. She wanted to put her hands on his tired eyes, but dared not.

They talked of Finn and she talked softly and soothingly to him as to a child, happy to be going the way he wanted. She found such gentle words and such impressive ones…she found her smile again and looked at him and met his smile, which came stealing to his face like a sun-gleam and vanished again at once.

He heard but little of what she said. But the sound of her voice did him good. He heard it and the rain, which beat against the panes, and it grew warm and peaceful around him.

His fears, which had aroused and spied and driven his every thought and turned and weighed his every doubt, slumbered in this quiet hour. He sat there like an old man who has suffered so much that his faculties have been blunted to pain and who takes his solace as it comes and is thankful.

He looked at her as he used to look at his mother when he was young and unhappy. He thought of her as of a young girl who knew the old man so little and owed him nothing, but went to his chair and laid her roses in his hand, so that things might be a little pleasanter for him.

And once he moved uneasily in his chair and looked at her quite differently and said:

“Adelheid…why have I no child but him?”

He said that very quietly and, a little after, he said it again. He said it to himself and not to her. She saw this and wept, because sheknew he did not perceive it.

And the evening sped on.

They sat quietly and she was silent and talked again of their son up there in the old room. Then she said:

“Cordt, let us go up to him!”

“Both of us?”

She listened anxiously whether he would say any more…whether he would reflect who she was and thrust her from him in anger, as he had done before.

But he sat silent and looked at the red glow in the freplace.

Then she rose and put out her hands to him:

“Come…Cordt…let us go. We will sit with him a little and talk to him, quietly and cheerfully, till the shadows disappear. Then we will come down here again and they will return, when he is alone. But we will go up every day and fght with them for him and win him.”

He rose heavily and took her hand.

Fru Adelheid led him through the room like a child. They went through the long passage and up the secret stairs…She was always a little in front of him. Her eyes shone with happiness. The bells rang out in her soul and she held Cordt's hand so fast as though she would never let it go.

They came to the door of the old room and knocked and listened. She looked at him and bent over his hand and kissed it with streaming tears.

Then she opened the door briskly and went in with head uplifted and drew him after her.

Over by the window sat Cordt's son, in one of the big chairs. He had shot himself.

THE END.
