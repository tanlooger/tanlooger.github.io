第一部分　培养宁静欢愉的心境





第一章　是什么让你疲惫，如何应对疲惫


这里有个重要而惊人的事实：单纯地进行脑力劳动并不会使你疲惫。这听起来似乎很荒唐，不过几年前科学家曾试图了解人类大脑工作多久后会“降低工作效率”——疲惫的定义。科学家们惊讶地发现，大脑在持续活动时，经过大脑的血液丝毫没有留下疲惫的痕迹！如果你从体力劳动者的动脉中抽取一滴血液，你会发现其中充满了“疲劳毒素”和其他因疲劳产生的物质。但如果你从爱因斯坦的动脉中抽取一滴血，则不会发现任何疲劳毒素。

目前看来，大脑在工作八小时甚至十二个小时后依然如新。大脑的耐疲劳性无与伦比……那么究竟是什么让你疲惫呢？

精神病学家宣称，大多数疲劳来自我们的精神状态和情绪。英国最显赫的精神病学家A．A．布里尔博士的观点更绝对：“百分之百脑力劳动者的疲劳都来自精神因素，也就是情绪。”

那么，何种情绪因素会使脑力劳动者感到疲惫呢？愉悦？满足？不！绝不是！感觉无聊、愤恨、不被赏识、徒劳、匆忙、焦虑才是使人感到疲惫的情绪因素，这些情绪还会使人易患感冒，效率降低，因头痛而不得不提早下班。没错，坏情绪使身体紧张，因此我们才会疲惫不堪。

大都会人寿保险公司在一张宣传画上指出：“努力工作这件事本身所制造的疲惫，如果可以睡个好觉或是好好休息，就能得到大大的缓解。只有忧虑、紧张和不良情绪才是造成疲惫的三大原因。往往在人们归罪于体力和脑力劳动时，事实上，这些因素才是罪魁祸首。请记住，紧张的肌肉便是工作着的肌肉。学会放松些！把精力留给重要的任务。”

现在请停下来做一下自我检查。当你阅读这几行文字时，你是否皱着眉头？你的双目之间是否是紧绷的？你感觉自己的坐姿放松吗？你的肩膀是否耸起？你脸上的肌肉紧张吗？如果你的整个身体不像旧娃娃一样松弛，那么此时此刻你正在制造着神经和肌肉的紧张，也就意味着你制造着神经和肌肉的疲劳！

为何在进行脑力工作时会产生不必要的紧张呢？丹尼尔·W．乔斯林说过：“我发现最主要的原因是一种几乎普遍存在的意识，即认为努力工作需要卖力，否则这件事就做不好。”所以我们在聚精会神时会不由自主地紧锁眉头、耸起肩膀。我们命令肌肉做出努力的姿态——而这并不会帮助大脑进行工作。

精神疲劳的解药是什么？放松！放松！放松！一定要记住，学会在工作时放松！

这听起来似乎很容易，但事实上很难。因为你可能需要改变一辈子养成的习惯，但努力是值得的——它有可能给你的人生带来一场革命！威廉·詹姆斯在《放松宝典》一文中说过：“美国人的过度紧张、躁动、急促以及表达方式的夸张和强烈，都只不过是坏习惯而已。”紧张是一种习惯，放松也是一种习惯。而我们可以改正坏习惯，养成好习惯。

怎样才能放松呢？从心理开始还是从神经开始？都不是。要记住，永远先从肌肉开始！

让我们来试试吧。让我们先从眼睛开始，展示如何放松。请通读此段，当你读到此段结尾时，后背向后倚，闭上眼睛，默默对自己说：放松，放松，不要紧张，不要皱眉……放松，放松……慢慢地重复一分钟。

你是否察觉眼部的肌肉在几秒钟后开始听话了？是否感觉到有双无形的手抚走了紧张？就是如此神奇，你在一分钟内已经尝试了放松艺术的全部诀窍和秘密。你也可以用同样的方法放松你的下巴、脸颊、脖子、肩膀以及全身，但最关键的器官还是眼睛。芝加哥大学的埃德蒙·雅各布森博士甚至说过，如果能彻底放松眼部肌肉，你就能忘掉所有烦恼！眼睛之所以对于缓解神经紧张发挥着如此重要的作用，是因为它们占用了身体精神能量总消耗的四分之一。这也是为什么视力完美的人也会出现眼部疲劳的现象，都是眼部的紧张造成的。

著名小说家维姬·鲍姆说，她小时候遇到了一位老人，并从他那里学到了最重要的一课。有一次，她摔倒了，膝盖和手腕都受了伤，这时老人过来把她扶了起来。这位老人曾经在马戏团演过小丑，他一边拍去她身上的尘土一边说：“你受伤是因为你不懂如何放松自己。你得想象着自己就像只软塌塌的袜子，又柔弱又软和。来吧，让我教给你如何做。”

后来，那位老人还教给维姬·鲍姆和其他的小孩们如何奔跑、如何翻跟斗。他总是反复强调：“想象着自己柔软得像只皱巴巴的旧袜子，自然就可以放松了！”

你可以在任何奇怪的场合进行放松，只要你不刻意地、夸张地去放松。放松意味着抹去一切紧张和压迫，感受从容与自在。从想象眼睛与脸部的肌肉开始学习放松。反复对自己说：放松……放松……放松……感受能量从脸部肌肉流向身体中心，想象着自己像婴儿一样没有丝毫的紧张感。

伟大的女高音歌唱家嘉丽·库契就是这样做的。海伦·杰普森告诉我，她常常看到嘉丽·库契在演出前坐在椅子里，慢慢放松脸部肌肉，她的下巴放松得简直就像要坠下来了一样。这是个很好的习惯，这样会使她在上台前避免过于紧张、防止疲劳。

下面是帮助你放松的四个建议：

1．随时随地放松。尽量让你的身体像旧袜子一样松弛。我在办公桌上放了一只褐红色的袜子，提醒着自己应该如此松弛。如果你没有袜子，一只猫也行。你是否曾经抱起过在阳光下睡觉的猫？放松就是猫那种像湿报纸一样耷下来、软绵绵的感觉。就连印度的瑜伽修行者都说过，若想掌握放松的艺术就要研究猫。我从来没见过疲惫、神经崩溃或者是失眠、忧虑、得胃溃疡的猫。你如果能学会像猫一样放松，那么或许也能避免被这些症状所困扰。

2．工作时尽可能地选用舒服的姿势。记住，身体上的紧张会导致肩膀疼痛和神经疲劳。

3．每天自我检查四五次，问自己：“我是否努力过头了？我是否在用与工作无关的肌肉？”这会帮助你养成放松的习惯。就如大卫·哈罗德·芬克博士所说：“最懂心理学的人都知道这是事半功倍的习惯。”

4．一天结束前再做一次自我检查，反省自己：“我究竟有多累？如果感觉累，那不是因为脑力劳动本身，而是我进行劳动的方式不对。”丹尼尔·W．乔斯林说：“我不以每天的疲劳程度来衡量自己的成就，而是以轻松的程度来衡量。一天下来如果我感觉特别疲劳，我便知道，这一天的工作在数量和质量上毫无疑问都是低效的。”如果美国的所有商业人士都懂得这个道理，那么高血压死亡率一定会一夜间骤减的，我们的疗养所和精神病院也不会出现因疲劳和焦虑而崩溃的病人们了。





第二章　告别不良情绪，重返好心情


疲惫的首要原因便是厌烦。让我们用爱丽丝的故事来举例说明。爱丽丝是住在某一条街上的一个企业小职员。有一天她精疲力竭地回到家，她的一举一动中都显露出她很疲惫。她头痛，后背也痛，连晚饭都不想吃，只想直接去睡觉。她的母亲苦苦劝说她才坐到了饭桌边。这时电话铃响了，是男友打来的，邀请她去跳舞。她的眼睛里忽然有了光芒，精神也振奋了。她跑到楼上，换上了最适合她的蓝色长裙就跑去跳舞了，直到凌晨三点才回来。回来后她一点都不累。实际上她兴奋得一夜睡不着觉。

八小时前的爱丽丝看似十分疲惫，但她真的是累了吗？也许当时是真的。她很累，因为工作令她厌烦，或许生活也使她厌烦。世界上有无数个爱丽丝，你或许就是其中之一。

众所周知，情绪因素比生理因素更会使人疲惫。几年前，约瑟夫·E．巴尔马克博士在《心理学档案》中发表了一篇实验报告，报告中论述了厌烦的情绪是如何导致疲劳的。巴尔马克博士让一组学生完成一系列他们不感兴趣的测试。结果，学生们不仅感到又疲劳又困乏，还抱怨感到头痛、眼睛不适、心情不好等症状。有些人甚至连胃都不舒服了。这些都是学生们幻想出来的吗？当然不是。他们还对这些学生做了新陈代谢的测试，结果显示当他们感觉厌烦时，体内血压和耗氧量都会降低。而一旦他们产生了兴趣和喜悦，整个新陈代谢的速度都会立刻加快！

在做有趣、刺激的事时，我们很少会感到疲惫。比如说，最近我在加拿大洛基山脉的路易斯湖附近度假。我一连几天都在珊瑚溪边钓鳟鱼，试图越过比我还高的树丛、木桩、倒塌的树木，然而这样的八个小时过后我一点也不累。为什么？因为我很兴奋、激动不已。钓到六条凶猛的鳟鱼，让我很有成就感。但如果我在钓鱼的时候感到无聊，你觉得我又会有怎样的感受呢？我肯定会因在海拔七千尺的高度做着如此费劲的工作而感到精疲力竭。

即便是在爬山这样令人劳累的活动中，厌烦的情绪依然比体力消耗本身更令人感到疲惫。明尼阿波利斯农业与机械储蓄银行总裁S．H．金曼先生曾跟我说起过一件事，这件事完美地证实了上述观点。1953年7月，加拿大政府要求加拿大登山俱乐部为威尔士亲王的皇家园林卫队提供登山培训，金曼先生就是被选中的培训者之一。他告诉我，他和其他指导员——几个四十二到五十九岁的男人，是如何带领这支年轻团队徒步穿过冰天雪地，以及依靠绳子越过了四十尺高的、几乎没有落手落脚之处的悬崖的。他们登上了迈克尔峰、副总统峰，以及加拿大洛基山脉小约赫山谷里的其他不知名山峰。经过十五个小时的攀岩后，这些身体素质处于顶峰的年轻人个个都已经精疲力竭了（在此之前，他们刚刚完成了六周艰苦的突击训练）。

是攀岩用到了突击训练时未练结实的肌肉而导致了疲惫吗？任何经历过突击训练的人都会鄙视这个可笑的问题！不，他们之所以感到极度劳累是因为他们认为爬山非常无聊，他们疲惫到连饭都没吃就睡着了。但是那些指导员，年龄是年轻士兵两到三倍的人，他们难道就不感觉累吗？不，他们当然也很累，但还没到精疲力竭的程度。他们吃了晚饭，还继续聊了好几个小时的天，聊这一天的经历。他们并没有精疲力竭，因为他们对攀岩这件事感兴趣。

哥伦比亚的爱德华·桑代克博士曾经进行过一项关于疲劳的实验，他调动年轻人的兴趣而使他们连续一周不睡觉。经过大量调查及实验后，桑代克博士得出结论：“厌倦是工作效率降低的唯一原因。”

如果你是脑力工作者，使你疲劳的原因很少会是劳动本身，你或许是因为还剩多少没有做的工作而感觉疲劳的。比如上周某天你工作时总是受到干扰，该回的信一封都没有回；提前制定的日程都打乱了……你觉得处处都是麻烦。那天一切都不顺，你什么都没做成，却感觉疲惫不堪，头都快裂开了。

第二天却完全不一样，一切都进展得很顺利，你完成的工作是前一天的四十倍，然而一天下来你却神清气爽，到家时感觉就像一朵白色栀子花一样。你我肯定都有过那样的经历。

因此我们要学到的是：疲劳往往不是工作造成的，而是担心、焦虑和愤恨造成的。

撰写此章时，我去看了一部重排的音乐戏剧，杰罗姆·科尔恩的《演艺船》。剧中的棉花号上的安迪船长说了一句充满哲理的台词：“幸运的人能做自己所爱的事。”这些人是幸运的，因为他们有更多的精力和欢乐，而极少有焦虑与疲劳。兴趣在哪儿，精力就在哪儿。和满腹怨言的妻子或丈夫走一个路口要比和甜蜜爱人走十个路口累多了。

所以呢？你能做些什么？一位速记员是这样做的：她在俄克拉何马州塔尔萨市的一家石油公司上班。每个月中总有几天她都要重复一项再无趣不过的工作——往石油租约表格里录入数据。这项任务太单调枯燥了，以至于她下定决心为了自己的身心健康也要把它变得有趣起来。她是怎样做到呢？她决定每天都和自己竞赛，每天上午都要数清填好的表格数量，下午试图超越上午的工作量。她每天都算出填表总数，争取下一天填得更多。结果，这样做以后，她填的表格总数是部门中最多的。这一切能带给她什么？赞美？没有。感谢？也没有。升职、提薪？更没有。但是这帮助她避免了厌倦所导致的疲惫，给了她精神上的刺激。由于她尽力使无聊的工作变得有趣，她拥有了更多精力和热情，在闲暇时也获得了更多快乐。

我保证这个故事是真的，因为我娶了这个女孩为妻。

下面是另外一个速记女孩试图以工作为乐趣从而得到回报的故事。她曾经极度反感自己的工作，但现在不同了。她就是伊利诺伊州埃尔姆赫斯特市的瓦莉·G．格尔登小姐。她在信中讲到了自己的故事：

“我们办公室里一共有四个速记员，每个人都要处理来自不同主管的信件，有时我们会忙得不可开交。有一天，当某一位部门副总坚持让我重写一封信时，我一开始很抗议。我试图指出不必全部重写也能在信件上做出改动。然而他坚决地说：如果你不重写，我可以找别人做这份工作！我气得直冒烟。不过当我开始重新打字时，我忽然意识到，的确有很多人会争先恐后地做我这份工作，而且在做这件事时，我不是也拿到了薪水吗？这样一想，我感觉好多了。所以我决定尝试着去爱这份工作，或假装很爱——尽管事实并非如此。后来我有了一个重要的发现，如果我在做事时假装很爱这个差事，我就真的有可能在某种程度上喜欢上它。我还发现，当我喜欢做一件事时，速度也会提高，因此我现在很少需要加班了。这种新态度帮我赢得了好员工的名声。因此，当一个部门的主管需要私人秘书时，他就想到了我，想请我做这份工作，他说我总是超额完成任务还毫无怨言。观念转变所带来的力量对我来说是难以想象的。它简直有创造奇迹的能量！”

格尔登小姐的故事有力地印证了汉斯·费英格教授的“假设”哲学。他让我们在行动时假设自己是幸福的。

如果你假装喜欢自己的工作，那份“佯装”真的会提升你的兴趣，也就会减少你疲劳、紧张和焦虑的感受。

几年前，哈伦·A．霍华德做了一个改变他一生的决定，他发誓要把枯燥的工作变得有趣。他的工作也的确很枯燥，在高中午餐室刷盘子、擦台子、盛冰淇淋，而其他男孩不是在玩球就是在逗女孩。哈伦·霍华德讨厌他的工作，但为了生存不得不做，所以他决心研究冰淇淋。他想了解冰淇淋该如何制作、需要哪些配料以及为何有些冰淇淋更好吃。他认真地学习了冰淇淋的化学组成，也慢慢成了高中化学课上的奇才。他对食物化学产生了浓厚的兴趣，后来考上了马萨诸塞州立学院的食品技术系。纽约可可交易所举办了一个关于可可和巧克力的使用的有奖征集论文活动，猜猜是谁获胜并得到了一百美金的奖励？没错，正是哈伦·霍华德。

后来在找工作未果期间，霍华德把麻省阿默斯特市家中的地下室变成了他的私人实验室。不久后阿默斯特市通过了一项新的法律，要求牛奶上市前必须经过细菌量计算。霍华德很快便开始为十四家阿默斯特的牛奶公司计算细菌量，还雇了两名助手。

二十五年后他又会在做什么？这位经营食品化学技术公司的老板将退休或死去；那些积极、热情的年轻人会取代他的位置。二十五年后，哈伦·霍华德或许成了业界中的领袖，而与他一同卖冰淇淋的同学或许会失业，还会骂政府、抱怨自己从未得到过机会。霍华德若不是立志要使无聊的工作有趣起来，或许也不会得到任何机会。

几年前还有另外一个年轻人也在做着同样很枯燥的工作——在车床场生产螺丝钉，他叫山姆。山姆一直想辞职，但担心找不到其他工作。山姆告诉自己，既然他必须做这份工作，那么他要使工作变得有趣。所以他决定和旁边的技工比赛。一个人要把粗糙的一面抛光，而另一个人要把螺丝钉磨到合适的长度。他们偶尔交换机器，看谁能制造出最多的螺丝钉。组长对山姆工作的速度和精确度印象深刻，很快便给了他一份更好的工作。这仅仅是一系列晋升的开始。三十年后，山姆成了鲍尔温机车厂的厂长。但假如当初山姆没有立志把无聊的工作变得有趣，那或许他一辈子都将是一个普普通通的小技工。

著名广播分析家H．V．卡腾伯恩曾告诉我他是如何使无聊的工作变得有趣的。二十二岁时，他在一艘横渡大西洋的牲口船上喂牲口。后来，在骑自行车游览英国后，他饥肠辘辘、身无分文地来到了巴黎。他卖了相机，拿到五块钱，在巴黎版《纽约先锋报》上刊登了一则广告，找到了一份卖立体感幻灯机的工作。我还记得这种老式幻灯机，把它放在眼前看两幅一样的图片，看着看着，奇迹就发生了。幻灯机中的两个镜片把两张图片转换成了一张三维图片，我们看到了深度和惊人的立体感。

书归正传，卡腾伯恩开始在巴黎挨家挨户地推销这种幻灯机，而这个时候的他连法语都不会讲。不过他居然第一年就赚了五千美金的佣金，成了当年全法国薪水最高的销售人员之一。卡腾伯恩告诉我，这段经历给他带来的锻炼以及对成功特质的培养远远胜过在哈佛大学任何一年的教育。他十分自信地告诉我，这次经历后，他觉得自己有能力成功地向法国家庭主妇推销国会议事录。

正因为这段经历让他深入了解了法国的生活，也对他今后在广播中诠释欧洲大事件做出了极大的贡献。

那不会说法语的卡腾伯恩是如何成为销售专家的呢？他先让老板把推销时要说的话用纯正的法语写了下来，然后他全部都背下来。在推销前，他会按响某家的门铃，一位家庭主妇会来开门，然后他就开始背诵那一套推销词，他的发音又糟糕又滑稽。然后，他会给这位家庭主妇看图片。当她问任何问题时，他都回答：“一个美国人……一个……美国人。”然后摘下帽子指给对方看被他粘在帽子顶上的那段推销词。家庭主妇通常会被他逗得捧腹大笑，他也跟着哈哈笑——同时给对方看更多的图片。说到这些时，卡腾伯恩承认这项工作并不简单。他告诉我，让他挺下来的唯一原因只是：他想使工作变得有趣的决心。每天早晨他都要对着镜子给自己打气：“卡腾伯恩，如果你不想饿肚子就要做这份工作，既然你必须做这份工作，为何不享受它的过程呢？为何不在每次按铃时想象着自己是舞台角灯前的演员，面对的是观众？要是你正在做的事正如舞台上的表演一样滑稽，那么为何不投入热情去做好这件事呢？”

卡腾伯恩先生告诉我，正是凭着这每日训话的帮助，他把曾经惧怕的工作转为了给他带来丰厚回报的有趣刺激的活动。

我请他给渴望成功的美国年轻人提供一些建议。他说：“每天早晨激励自己。我们总会说起运动的重要性，运动能唤醒半梦半醒的人。然而我们更需要每天早晨进行精神与心灵的唤醒，让自己快速地投入行动。因此，每天都给自己打打气吧。”

这种每日自我训话的做法是愚蠢、肤浅而幼稚的吗？不，恰恰相反，这是心理健康的核心。“观念塑造生活。”这几个字在当今社会和在一千八百年前马可·奥勒留写下它们时同样是真理。

不断地给自己鼓舞士气，你便引导着自己拥有了勇气与幸福、力量与和平。时常告诉自己要感恩，心灵便会翱翔、会歌唱。

拥有了正确的思维，你便能使任何工作更加如意。你的老板当然希望你能对工作感兴趣，这样他才能赚更多的钱。但是让我们忘记老板们想要什么，只想想对工作感兴趣能带给自己什么。提醒自己，对一切充满兴趣能使生活中的快乐加倍。你醒着的一半时间都是在工作中度过的，如果你无法在工作中找到快乐，便也很难在其他地方找到了。一直提醒自己对工作产生兴趣，真的能让你忘掉焦虑。从长远角度讲，这很可能带来晋升和加薪。即便不能，也能使疲劳感降到最低，让你能更好地享受闲暇时光。





第三章　预防疲劳的四种良好工作习惯


良好工作习惯No．1　清除办公桌上除了手头需要的文件以外的所有纸张


芝加哥与西北铁路公司总裁罗兰·L．威廉姆斯曾说过：“桌上各类纸张堆积成山的人一旦清理了桌子，只留下解决手头问题所需的文件，就会发现做事轻松多了，也高效多了。我把这称为持家好习惯。这是提高效率的第一步。”

如果你参观过华盛顿的国会图书馆，你会看到顶部有诗人蒲柏的一句名言：“秩序是天堂的第一定律。”

秩序也应是商界的第一定律。不过现实中并非人人都遵守这个定律。人们的办公桌上常常堆积着几周都没碰过的文件。新奥尔良一家报社的出版人就告诉过我，有一次，秘书在收拾他的桌子时，竟然找到了丢失了两年的打字机！

仅仅看着桌上堆放得满满的未回复的信件、报告和备忘录，就足以产生困惑、不安和焦虑，但这还不是全部，这些文件时刻提醒着你：还有无数件事要做但时间远远不够。这一切不仅会令人不安与疲惫，还有可能导致高血压、心脏病和胃溃疡。

宾夕法尼亚大学医学院研究所的约翰·H．斯托克斯博士曾在美国医学会上宣读过他的论文，题目叫《与机体疾病并发的功能性神经症》。在论文中，斯托克斯博士提到了“从病人的精神状况中寻找什么”的主题并列出了十一个症状。第一个便是：

一种绝对的义务感或负担感——前方有无穷尽的事必须被完成。

但是收拾桌子、做决定这样的简单措施又怎么能帮你减压、减少负担感呢？知名精神病专家威廉·L．塞得勒博士提到过，他正是用这个简单办法治好了一个精神崩溃的患者。这个病人是芝加哥一家大公司的总裁，他刚找到塞得勒博士时紧张兮兮、满脸忧虑，充满了不安。他知道自己快挺不住了，但又不能离开工作，他只能寻求医生的帮助。

“就在病人给我讲他的故事时，我的电话响了。”塞得勒博士说，“电话是医院打来的。我一点儿也不拖延立刻就做出了决定，我尽可能地立即处理每一件事。刚挂电话不久，电话铃声又响起了，又是紧急事件，于是我花了些时间在电话里讨论问题。后来，第三次打扰出现了，我的同事进来咨询如何处理一个重病患者的情况。全部处理完之后我转向我的访客，为让他久等而道歉。然而他的心情却明快起来，脸上也露出了与进来时截然不同的神情。

“‘医生，不必道歉！’他说，‘在刚才的十分钟里，我觉得我知道自己的问题出在哪里了。我要回我的办公室，我要改变我的工作习惯。但是在我离开前，您介意让我看看您的办公桌吗？’”

于是，塞得勒博士打开了桌子的所有抽屉，里面除了办公用品以外没有其他的东西。病人问：“您没处理完的事项都放在哪呢？’”

“都处理完了！”塞得勒说。

“那没回的信呢？”

“都回了！”塞得勒告诉他，“我的规矩是：绝不拖延没回的信。我会在第一时间向秘书口述回信内容。”

六周后，这位总裁邀请塞得勒博士去他的办公室。他完全变了一个样，他的桌子也是。他打开办公桌抽屉，里面没有任何未处理的工作。“六周前，”这位总裁说，“我有两个办公室，三个办公桌，而且全都被各种文件盖得满满的。永远都有工作在等着我。与您见面之后，我一回来就清走了一车的旧文件。现在我只有一个办公桌，工作一来立马解决。我不再被堆积如山的工作所纠缠，也不再紧张、焦虑。然而最让我震惊的是——我痊愈了，所有的健康问题都消失了！”

前美国最高法院首席法官查尔斯·埃文斯·休斯说过：“人不会死于过量的工作，却会死于消耗与焦虑。”是的，精力的消耗及焦虑来源于看似永远无法完成的工作。





良好工作习惯No．2　按事情的轻重缓急排序


全国城市服务公司的创始人亨利·L．多尔蒂说过，不论开出多高薪水，同时具备以下两种能力的人都是极难找到的。

这两种无价的能力是：独立思考能力和按轻重缓急办事的能力。

查尔斯·拉克曼是一个白手起家，在十二年内攀升至白速得公司总裁，年薪十万美金并有百万其他收入的小伙子，他曾经说过，他的成功很大程度上源于亨利·L．多尔蒂推崇的极为难得的两个能力。查尔斯·拉克曼说：“从记事起我都是早晨五点起床，因为那是最适合我思考的时间。我在那时可以进行更好的思考，然后计划接下来的一天，安排做事的优先顺序。”

弗兰克·贝特格，美国最成功的保险销售人，他从不会等到早晨五点才起来制订计划。他会在前一个晚上为自己定下第二天的目标：要卖出的保险份额。倘若达不到，差额便会被加到下一天的销售额目标中，以此类推。

丰富的经验告诉我们，人们永远无法总按轻重缓急的顺序做事，但是我们也知道，制订出做事顺序的计划的确比“即兴演绎”要好得多。

如果萧伯纳没有制订严格的规定来控制做事的优先顺序，那么他或许也不会成为作家，而是做一辈子的银行出纳。他在那令人心碎的九年中强制自己每天写五页作品，虽然在这九年中他一共只赚了三十美金——差不多每天收入一便士。就连小说中的鲁滨逊·克鲁索都会按每小时该做什么来制订一天的计划。





良好工作习惯No．3　必要信息齐全时，立刻做决定，绝不拖延


已故的H．P．豪威尔——我以前的学生——曾经告诉我，他作为美国钢铁董事会成员参加董事会议时，发现会议总是拖拖拉拉的，讨论了很多问题却做不了几个决定，结果每个成员都要把很多报告带回家进一步研究。

最后，豪威尔先生说服了董事会，每次在会议上只着手解决一个问题、做一个决定，不拖延、不推迟。这个决定有可能是需要获取更多信息，有可能是做某事或不做某事，但不做出一个决定便不转移到下一个问题。豪威尔先生告诉我，这样子改变以后，效果是有效且惊人的：记事表清空了，日历干净了，董事会成员再也不用带一堆报告回家了。那种因问题永远解决不完而产生的焦虑完全消失了。

这条规矩不仅适用于美国钢铁董事会，对你我也会有所帮助。





良好工作习惯No．4　学着整合、委派和监督


很多商业人士正在过早地把自己送往坟墓，因为他们不懂得如何下放权责，总是包揽一切工作。结果呢？各种细节纠缠着他们。他们永远感觉不安、焦虑、紧张、匆忙。我知道，学会下放权责不容易。一开始对我来说也很不容易，困难重重。我也经历过把权责下放给错的人所造成的灾难。但不论如何，管理者必须学会下放权责，才能消除一些不安、紧张和疲惫。

很多不懂得整合、委派和监督的总裁五六十岁就患了心脏病——都是紧张和不安导致的。如果你认为这是危言耸听，那么看看报纸上的讣告便知真假。




若想减少不安和疲惫：

1．把桌子上与手头那项工作无关的纸张全部清理走。

2．按事情的轻重缓急排序。

3．必要信息齐全时，立刻做决定。

4．学会整合、委派和监督。





第四章　没人会去踢一条死狗


1929年芝加哥发生了一件轰动全国教育界的事，全美的学者都赶赴芝加哥见证此事。几年前，一个名叫罗伯特·哈金斯的年轻男子用当餐厅服务员、伐木工、家教和服装销售员赚来的钱供自己读完了耶鲁大学。八年后的他成了芝加哥大学的校长，这是美国第四大资源丰富的名校，而他只有三十岁！这简直不可思议！年长的教育家们纷纷摇头。无数的批评声向这个“神奇男孩”排山倒海地涌来，纷纷说他这不对、那不好，认为他太年轻、缺乏经验，教育理念太荒唐。就连报纸都加入了批评大军。

哈金斯就职那天，一个朋友对他的父亲说：“我很惊讶报纸竟然这样诋毁你的儿子。”

“是的，”老哈金斯回答，“这非常糟糕，但别忘了，没人会去踢一只死狗。”

没错，这只狗越重要，别人踢它时就越有满足感。后来成为爱德华八世的威尔士亲王也受到过这样的“待遇”。那时他在位于德文郡的达特茅斯学院就读——那是相当于美国安纳波利斯海军学院的一所院校，当时亲王大概有十四岁。一天，一名海军军官发现他在哭，就问他发生了什么。一开始他不肯回答，后来终于承认，海军学员们踢了他。学院的指挥官把那些男孩召集起来，首先说明亲王并未告状，但希望知道为何大家孤立他并如此粗暴地对待他。

男孩们支支吾吾，脚尖蹭来蹭去，很长时间后终于说了实话。他们希望有朝一日成为海军军官为国王效劳时就能跟别人说：我踢过国王！

所以当你被人踢、被人骂时请记住，那些人往往是想通过这种行为来感觉自己重要，这往往意味着你有所成就、值得被关注。很多人通过诋毁比自己学历高或更有成就的人来得到粗暴的满足感。比如说，我在撰写此章时收到了一位女士的来信，她在信中谴责了威廉·布斯将军——救世军组织的创始人。我曾经当众赞赏过布斯将军，但是这个女人写道，布斯将军挪用了八百万捐给穷人的款项。这种指控自然是莫须有的，但这个女人并不在意事实，她只想通过诋毁比她层次高的人来获取快感。我把这封可悲的信扔进了垃圾筐，并感谢上苍我没有娶这样一个女人。她的信中并没有提到多少有关布斯将军的信息，反倒让我看到她是怎样的人。叔本华数年前说过：“卑微的人总是从伟人的缺点和失误中得到极大的快感。”

很少有人认为耶鲁大学的校长会是卑微的人，然而耶鲁的一位前校长就曾把诋毁美国总统候选人作为极大的乐趣。这位耶鲁前校长警告大家，如果这个候选人当选总统，那么“我们的妻子和女儿或许会去卖淫，彻底地身败名裂，会虚荣肮脏、不知廉耻、没有道德、人神共愤”。

这听上去好像是在指责希特勒，不是吗？但并非如此。他骂的是托马斯·杰斐逊。哪个托马斯·杰斐逊？难道是那个千载扬名的托马斯·杰斐逊，《独立宣言》的起草者、民主的守护神？没错，就是他。

你猜猜还有哪位美国人被骂作“伪君子”“骗子”和“只比杀人犯好一点点”？而且在报纸上刊登的一幅漫画中，他趴在断头台上即将被斩首，游街示众时周围嘲笑声、嘘声一片。你猜这个人是谁？对，是乔治·华盛顿。

当然这是很久远的事了，或许人性已经进化了。那让我们再看一看海军上将佩里的例子吧。他在1909年4月6日乘着狗拖的雪橇到达了北极，这震惊了全世界。这是几个世纪以来，勇敢的人不畏痛苦、饥饿与死亡而试图实现的目标。不过，佩里本人也差点死于寒冷和饥饿，他的八个脚趾也因严重冰冻而不得不被切除。路上的重重灾难使他不堪重负，他一度曾担心自己会疯掉。他的上司——身在华盛顿的海军军官——看不惯佩里受到的极大关注和赞赏，于是指控他打着科学探险的旗号赚钱，并且“在北极无所事事”。可悲的是绝大多数人相信了，因为他们本就希望听到这些，所以很难不去相信。他们羞辱并阻挠佩里的决心是如此坚定，若不是麦金莱总统直接下命令，佩里在北极的事业便无法继续了。

如果佩里做的是坐在华盛顿海军部办公室里的工作，他还会被如此声讨吗？不会。那样的人不够重要，不足以引起嫉妒。

格兰特将军的遭遇比佩里上将还要糟糕。1862年，格兰特将军为北方赢得了一场伟大的胜利。这是一个下午就得来的胜利，是使格兰特将军一夜成名的胜利，即便在遥远的欧洲也反响巨大。从缅因到密西西比河岸的教堂都鸣起了钟声、燃起了篝火。然而胜利后的六周里，格兰特这个北方英雄就被拘捕了，他的兵权也被剥夺了。他在羞辱和绝望中哭泣。

为什么格兰特将军会在胜利高潮中被捕呢？很大程度上是因为他傲慢的上级心生妒忌。




在受到不公的批评干扰时，请记住：

不公的批评往往是变相的赞美。请记住，没人会去踢一条死狗。





第五章　不被批评所伤害


我曾经采访过斯梅德利·巴特勒少将，就是那个号称老“犀利眼”、老“地狱魔鬼”的巴特勒！还记得他吗？他是统帅过美国海军的将军中最多姿多彩、神气活现的一个。

他告诉我，他年轻时急切地渴望成为受欢迎的人，想给每个人留下好印象，所以在那段日子里，任何微小的批评都会刺痛他。不过他承认加入海军的三十年磨炼了他。“我曾经被责难、被侮辱。”他说，“我被骂成卑鄙懦弱、心如蛇蝎、臭名昭著的人，也曾被专家辱骂。所有不登大雅之堂的英文诅咒词汇都在我身上用过。哈！现在当我听到别人骂我时，我甚至不屑于回头看看那人是谁。”

或许老“犀利眼”巴特勒对于批评过于无动于衷了，但是有一件事是肯定的：我们大多数人把小小的嘲讽看得太过认真了。我记得几年前《纽约太阳报》有一名记者，他在参加我的成人教育班讲座后当众嘲讽了我和我的工作，当时我气坏了。我把它看作针对我本人的侮辱，我给《太阳报》执行委员会主席吉尔·霍吉斯致电，命令他发表一篇澄清文章，必须陈述事实而非嘲讽。我决心一定要讨个公道。

现在我为当时的举动感到羞愧。我知道买那份报纸的一半读者可能根本没有看到那篇文章，而看到的人中有一半只不过把它当作无足轻重的消遣而已，另一半幸灾乐祸的人不出几周便会把它忘得一干二净。

我现在明白了别人并不在意你和我，也不在意关于我们的舆论，他们只在乎自己的问题。在早饭前、早饭后、直到午夜过后的十分钟，他们关心自己轻微的头疼脑热要比你和我的死活多一千倍。

即便我们被骗、被嘲弄、被背叛、被暗算或者被最亲密的朋友出卖，也不该纵容自怜。相反，我们要提醒自己，这正是耶稣的遭遇。在耶稣最亲密的十二个朋友中，一个为了相当于今天十九美金的钱财而背叛了他，另一个在他受难时公然背弃了他，还三次宣称并发誓自己不认识耶稣。这是六分之一的比例！这就是耶稣的遭遇。那么你和我又凭什么期待更好的待遇呢？

几年前我发现虽然我不能阻止别人对我进行不公地批判，但我可以做更加重要的事：我可以决定是否允许自己被不公的指责所打扰。

当然，我并不是说要忽视所有批评的声音，我完全不是这个意思。我是说要忽视不公的批评。有一次我问艾莉诺·罗斯福，她是如何应付不公批评的——天知道她承受过多少不公平指责。她拥有的热忱朋友和残暴敌人的数量或许比在白宫生活过的任何一个女人都要多。

她告诉我，小的时候她很害羞，几近病态的害羞，惧怕人们的议论。她是如此害怕被批评以至于有一次她跑去向她的姑妈——西奥多·罗斯福的姐姐征求意见。她说：“百伊姑妈，我想做某某事，但是我怕被人议论。”

姑妈看着她的眼睛说：“只要你内心认为自己是正确的，就永远不要因别人的话而感到困扰。”艾莉诺·罗斯福告诉我，这条建议日后就像一块坚石一样守护着她在白宫的日子。她对我说，唯一避免评论的方法就是像德累斯顿瓷雕一样待在柜子里。“既然不论如何别人都会评判你，所以去做你内心觉得正确的事吧。因为做了会被谴责，不做也会被谴责。”这就是她的建议。

已故的马修·布拉在担任美国国际公司总裁一职时，我问他是否曾经对别人的评论敏感。他回答：“是的，早年非常敏感，那时我迫切地希望全公司的员工都认为我是完美的。我会首先试图讨好反对我的人，而这种举动又会激怒另一个人；当我处理与第二个人的问题时又捅了其他的马蜂窝。最后我终于意识到，我越是想安抚受伤的情绪从而逃避批评便树立了越多的敌人。所以最终我告诉自己：‘枪打出头鸟。习惯了就好。’这给了我极大的帮助。从那时起，我立下规矩：我会尽最大努力做事，然后撑起我那把旧雨伞，让议论之雨顺伞滑落，而不是灌入领口。”

蒂姆斯·泰勒做得更彻底。他让议论之雨灌入领口，然后大方地一笑而过。他在为每周日下午的纽约爱乐乐团的电台直播音乐会做中场休息讲解时，曾收到过一位女士的来信，信中称他为“骗子、背叛者、蛇蝎、恶魔”。后来泰勒先生在他的《人与音乐》一书中写道：“我怀疑她根本不关心谈论的内容。”然后在接下来一周的广播里他为千百万听众读了那封信。于是他再次收到那个女人的信，表达了她不变的观点。泰勒先生说：“在她的信中我依然是骗子、背叛者、蛇蝎、恶魔。”我们无法不敬仰能以这样的姿态面对批评的人，他平和、处事不惊，还颇具幽默感。

查尔斯·施瓦布在普林斯顿大学演讲时说到，他学到的最重要的一课是在施瓦布钢铁厂工作的一位德国老人给他上的。这位德国老人和其他工人陷入了激烈的争论中，被人扔进了河里。施瓦布先生说：“他走进我办公室时满身都是泥和水。我问他到底跟那些把他扔到河里的人们说了什么，他说：‘我只是一笑而过。’”

施瓦布强调他把德国老人的这句话当成了座右铭：“一笑而过。”当你是不公的批评的受害者时，这几个字尤其受用。你说的任何话别人都能反驳，但是人们能对“一笑而过”说什么呢？

如果林肯没有意识到扑面而来的刻薄谴责是多么的荒唐，或许他会垮在南北战争的重压下。他对如何应对此类谴责的描述也成了经典。麦克阿瑟将军在战争时期里把这些话打印出来挂在了指挥部办公桌的上方，丘吉尔把它镶在镜框中挂在了乡间别墅的书房里。林肯是这样说的：“如果我试图读完所有对我的攻击，那我就不用做其他事了，更别说一一回复。我只能竭尽所能把每件事做到最好，而且会一直做到底。如果结果是好的，对我的评价便无关紧要。如果结果是糟糕的，那么即便十个天使发誓说我是正确的也无济于事。”




当我们面对不公批评时，让我们记住：

竭尽全力地做事，然后撑开你的旧雨伞，不要让雨水灌入领口中。





第六章　你愿意用一百万的价格出售你的什么


我与哈罗德·艾伯特结识多年。他住在密苏里州的韦布城，曾经是我的演讲经理人。一天我们在堪萨斯城见面，然后他开车送我去我位于密苏里贝尔顿的农场。路上我问他是如何远离焦虑的，他给我讲了一个难忘的故事。

“我也曾经被焦虑所扰。”他说，“但1934年春天的一天，我走在韦布城西多尔蒂街上看到的景象，消除了我所有的焦虑。这一切是在十秒钟内发生的，但我在这十秒钟内学到的生活道理比过去十年还多。我在韦布城经营杂货店两年了，我不但用完了所有积蓄，还欠了要七年才能还清的债务。我的杂货店在前一周的周六关门了，我正要去商业与矿业银行贷款，这样我才能去堪萨斯城谋一份工作。我像一个失败者一样走着，我失去了所有的斗志和信念。忽然我看到迎面过来了一个失去双腿的人，他坐在用轮滑鞋的轮子和木板搭成的小车上，双手各持一根小木棍滑地前行。我看到他时，他刚滑过了马路，正把自己推上几寸高的人行道。当他把小木板翘起来时，我们的目光相遇了。他带着很灿烂的微笑，精神饱满地向我打招呼：‘早上好，先生！今天天气真好，不是吗？’当我站立着面对他时，我感觉自己很富有。我有双腿，我能走路。我为之前的顾影自怜而羞愧。我对自己说，如果他没有双腿都能快乐、积极、自信，那么我也一定能做到。我立刻感觉到很振奋。我之前准备向银行借一百美金，但现在我有勇气借二百美金了。我之前想对银行说，我要去堪萨斯找工作，而我现在要自信地宣布，我要去堪萨斯得到一份工作。我拿到了贷款，也找到了工作。

“我现在把这样一段话贴在了我家浴室的镜子上，每天早晨刮胡子时都要读一遍：

我没有鞋，所以沮丧。

直到有一天，我遇到了没有脚的人。”

艾迪·瑞肯贝克和同伴乘救生艇在太平洋迷失二十一天，我曾经问他从那次经历中学到的最重要的一课是什么。他说：“我从那段经历中明白的最重要的道理是：如果你有淡水喝、有食物吃，就不要抱怨任何事。”

《时代》周刊上刊登过一篇文章，讲的是一名警官的故事。他在瓜达康纳尔岛受了伤，子弹击中了他的喉咙，他接受了七次输血。他在小纸条上写字问医生：“我能存活吗？”医生说：“能。”他又写：“我还能说话吗？”医生再次给予了肯定的答复。然后他写道：“那我还有什么好担心的？”

此时此刻，为何不停下来问问自己：“我究竟在担心什么？”你或许会发现，那些你所担心的事情并不重要。

生活中90％的事是顺利的，而10％出了问题。我们若想快乐，只需要专注于90％的顺利，忽视10％的问题。如果我们想要忧心忡忡、苦楚不堪再得个胃溃疡，那就专注于10％的问题，忽视90％的顺利。

“思考和感恩”这五个字被刻在英国很多克伦威尔派的教堂中，这几个字也该被铭刻于我们的心中。我们应该思考所有值得感恩的事，感谢上天给予我们的恩惠和奖赏。

《格列佛游记》的作者乔纳森·斯威夫特可以说是英国文学界中最极端的悲观主义者。他为自己的出生感到遗憾，因此每到生日之际都会穿黑衣、行斋戒。然而，即便是这样一位绝望的顶级悲观主义者也赞美了快乐给身心带来的伟大力量。他宣称：“世上最好的医生就是均衡饮食、心平气和、心情舒畅。”

我们每天都能免费获得“心情舒畅医生”的服务。我们只需专注于我们拥有的财富，而这些财富远远大于阿里巴巴的宝藏。你会为了一百万而卖掉你的眼睛吗？双腿和双手呢？听觉呢？你的孩子？你的家人？把你的这些财富相加在一起，你会发现用洛克菲勒、福特和摩根的全部资产跟你换，你都不会愿意交换。

但我们对这些财富心怀感恩了吗？啊，没有。叔本华说过：“我们很少去想自己拥有什么，而总是在想缺少什么。”是的，这种心态是世上最大的悲剧。它所带来的悲痛或许比史上所有战争和疾病的总和还要多。

比如，它就曾让约翰·帕尔默从一个正常人变成了满腹牢骚的人，还差点毁了他的家。我知道这些因为这是他亲口告诉我的。

帕尔默先生住在新泽西州的帕特森市。他说：“我退伍后不久就开始做生意。我没日没夜地工作，一切都很顺利。后来麻烦来了。我找不到零件和材料，我怕不知哪天就要关门大吉了。我太担心了，以至于变成了一个爱发牢骚的人。我后来才察觉，那时的自己尖酸刻薄、脾气乖戾，差点就丢失了可爱的家。有一天，我的一个部下——一个年轻的残疾退伍军人对我说，‘约翰，你整天一副全世界只有你有麻烦的样子，你真该感到羞耻。就算你要把店关闭一阵子又能怎样？问题解决后你还可以再开张啊。你拥有很多值得感恩的东西，但你却总是在抱怨。天啊，我多希望拥有你所拥有的一切！看看我。我只有一个手臂，半边脸也被毁了，可我没有抱怨。如果你继续哀怨下去，你将失去的远远不止是一家店，而是你的健康、你的家庭和你的朋友！’

“听到那些话我愣住了，我意识到自己其实拥有很多。我当时立刻下决心改变，找回原来的自己，而我做到了。”

我的一个朋友露西尔·布莱克也是在即将陷入悲剧的边缘学会了感恩、快乐，而不是为缺失的东西而忧虑。

我几年前认识了露西尔，那时我们都在哥伦比亚大学新闻系学习短篇写作。几年前她的生活遭到了打击，那时她住在亚利桑那州图森市。她那时的生活……这是她的原话：

“我忙得团团转。我要在亚利桑那大学学习管风琴演奏，要在城里组织演讲培训班，还要在我居住的沙漠柳树农场教音乐欣赏课。晚间我还要参加各种派对、舞会、骑马的活动。某天早晨，我累得倒下了，我的心脏难受极了！医生说：‘你需要卧床整整一年来调整身体。’他不愿让我觉得自己还能恢复体能。

“卧床一年！那我就成了废物，可能还会死掉！我吓坏了！为什么这一切要发生在我身上？我做了什么坏事情，得到了这样的报应？我哭泣，我哀号。我充满愤恨、挣扎反抗。但我的确听从医嘱，卧床休息。我的邻居鲁道夫先生是一名艺术家。他对我说：‘你现在认为卧床一年会很悲惨，但实际上不会的。你将有时间思考并有机会认识自己。接下来的几个月里，你在精神上的成长将比之前所有的成长都要多。’听了这些话，我平静了许多，也试着去建立一套新的价值观。我读了引人深思的书籍。有一天我听到广播中的评论员说：‘人们只能表达存在于自身意识中的事物。’我之前也听到过无数类似的话语，但从未触及心灵，也没有在心中扎根。但从那时起，我决定只去思考那些我最重视的生活信条：喜悦、快乐和健康。我强迫自己每天早上醒来都默念一遍我要感恩的事物：身体没有疼痛、可爱的女儿、我的视力很好、我的听力很好、广播中好听的音乐、阅读的时间、好吃的食物、好朋友。我过得很快乐，还有很多的探望者过来看我，到最后医生不得不立一个牌子，要求只能在每天规定的时间段内接待一位访客。

“那是多年前的事了。现在的我过着充实、积极的生活。我非常感激卧床的那一年，那是我在亚利桑那州度过的最有价值、最快乐的一年。那时养成的每天早晨盘点幸福的习惯到现在还跟随着我。那是我最宝贵的财富之一。我很羞愧，因为直到我开始畏惧死亡时才真正学会了如何活着。”

我亲爱的露西尔·布莱克，你或许不知，你明白了塞缪尔·约翰逊博士在两百年前领悟的道理。约翰逊博士曾说过：“看到事物美好一面的习惯比每年赚一千英镑还可贵。”

我必须要提出，这些话不是职业乐观者说出的。说话者与焦虑、穷困和饥饿为伍二十年，最后终于成为那个时代最杰出的作家和空前绝后的雄辩家。

洛根·皮尔索·史密斯在短短一句话中注入了大量的智慧：“人生目标有二：其一，得你所想；其二，享你所得。只有最具智慧的人才能做到第二点。”

你想知道如何把洗碗变成有趣的事吗？如果答案是肯定的，建议你阅读伯格希尔德·道所著的非常励志的《我想看见》一书。

这本书是一个几乎失明了半个世纪的女人写的。“我只有一只眼睛。”她写道，“而它还布满伤疤，所以我只能从这只眼左部的一条缝隙里看世界。所以看书时，我要把书拿得离脸很近，还要尽可能地把眼球转向左边。”

尽管如此，她拒绝被怜悯，拒绝被他人当作“异类”。从小她就和其他孩子一起玩跳房子，但她看不见地上的标记，所以每当其他孩子回家后，她都会趴在地上，把眼凑到标记前牢牢记住。不久她就成了游戏高手。她在家读书，读的是大字书。她把书拿得离脸如此之近，以至于睫毛都碰到了纸张。她获得了两个文凭：明尼苏达大学的文学学士和哥伦比亚大学的文学硕士。

她一开始在明尼苏达州的小山村——双子山谷中教书，后来成了南达科他州苏瀑城奥古斯塔那学院的新闻和文学教授。她在此任教十三年，还在女子俱乐部演讲，在广播电台中谈书籍和作家。她写道：“在我的内心深处，总是有对全盲的恐惧。为了征服这恐惧，我选择用快乐甚至诙谐的态度面对人生。”

1943年，当她五十二岁时，奇迹发生了。著名的梅奥诊所为她做了手术，术后她的视力是之前的四十倍。一个崭新的美丽世界展现在她眼前，她现在觉得就连在水池边洗碗都是激动人心的事。“我开始玩洗碗盆里白色、蓬松的肥皂泡。”她写道，“我把双手伸进去，然后捧起来一团微小的肥皂泡。我在阳光下看它们，每个泡泡里都有一个微型彩虹，色彩斑斓。”

她向厨房水池上方的窗外看去，“一群麻雀正拍打着灰黑色的翅膀，穿越漫天雪花”。

为泡沫和麻雀深深着迷的她是这样为书结尾的：

“‘亲爱的上帝，’我轻声呼唤，‘我们天上的父，我感谢你。感谢你。’”

想象一下因为能在洗碗时看到色彩斑斓的泡沫和雪天中飞翔的麻雀而感谢上帝是怎样一番情景！

我们真该为自己感到羞耻。那些住在美丽童话世界里的每一天、每一年，我们却因盲目和贪婪而不曾看见、不曾体验。




如果你想停止忧虑、开始生活，请记住：

细数你拥有的恩惠而不是你遇到的麻烦。





第二部分　保持充沛的精力





第七章　发现自己，做回有个性的自己


请记住，在这个世界上你是独一无二的。

我接到来自北卡罗来纳芒特艾里的伊迪斯·奥尔雷德女士的一封信，信里面写道：

“儿时的我极度敏感、羞涩。我偏胖，而我的双颊使我看起来比实际还要胖。我有个思维很守旧的母亲，她认为穿好看衣服是愚蠢的。她常说：‘衣服大了能过，小了则破。’她也是依照这个理念打扮我的。我从来没参加过派对，也没做过什么有意思的事。我在校时从来没跟其他学生一起参加过课外活动，甚至连体育项目也没参加过。我的害羞是病态的。我认为自己和别人不一样，完全不受欢迎。

“长大后我嫁给了一个长我几岁的男人，而我却没有改变。我丈夫一家人是优雅而自信的，那是我长久以来所憧憬却没能成为的人。我想尽办法试图变成他们那样的人，但我做不到，让我改变的一切尝试都使我更深地钻进自己的壳里。我变得紧张易怒，我回避一切朋友。情况变得特别糟糕以至于我对门铃声都产生了恐惧。我知道自己很没用，也很怕我丈夫会发现这一点。所以每当我们在公共场合时我都强颜欢笑，夸张地扮演自己的角色。但我知道我演过头了，而之后的几天我都会在抑郁中度过。最后我变得非常不快乐，以至于我看不到继续存在的意义。我开始有了自杀的念头。”

那么，是什么改变了这个不快乐的女人的人生呢？只是不经意的一句话！

奥尔雷德女士继续说道：“一句话就这样改变了我的整个人生。有一天我婆婆讲起她如何培养孩子时说：‘不论在任何情况下，我都让孩子们做自己。’……‘让他们做自己。’就是这句话！瞬间我明白了自己一直以来都是自寻烦恼，我试图把自己塞进并不合适的模子里。

“一夜间我忽然变了一个人！我开始做自己，我开始学习了解自己，我试着找到自己的身份和优势。我尝试了一切可能的颜色和款式，找到了属于自己的穿着风格。我开始拓展自己的朋友圈，我还加入了一个社团，最早时是个小规模的。当他们让我参加一个节目时，我被吓傻了，但每次讲话后我都会增加一些信心。虽然这是个漫长的过程，但今天的我拥有了从前无法想象的快乐。现在当我教育自己的孩子时，我也时刻铭记着自己从苦楚经历中学到的一课：不论发生什么，永远做自己！”

不愿做自己真是个“有史以来就有的问题”。詹姆斯·戈登·吉尔其博士说过：“它就像生命一样普遍。”它也是很多神经症状、精神问题和其他复杂问题的病根。关于儿童教育问题，安吉洛·帕特里写过十三本书，诸多报纸也曾数千次登载过他的文章。他曾说过：“没有比想拥有别人的身体和头脑更悲惨的事了。”

在好莱坞，这种想成为别人的渴望更为强烈。山姆·伍德，好莱坞最知名的导演之一曾说过，年轻演员让他最头疼的事莫过于不愿做自己。他们宁可去当二流的拉娜·特纳或三流的克拉克·盖博。“观众已经知道那些风格了。”山姆·伍德不停地对年轻演员说，“现在观众想看些不一样的。”

山姆·伍德在拍《万世师表》《战地钟声》等电影之前从事房地产工作，这练就了他的销售技能。他认为商界的准则在电影界也适用。东施效颦、鹦鹉学舌是行不通的。山姆·伍德说：“经验告诉我，最安全的方法就是尽可能早地停用那些一味模仿他人的演员。”

我问过保罗·博因顿——当时他是一个大石油公司的招聘主管，人们应聘时所犯的最大错误是什么。他一定知道答案——他曾面试过六万多名求职者并写过一本名叫《求职六法宝》的书。他是这样回答的：“应聘者犯下的最大错误就是不表现真实的自己。他们往往不能坦诚，总是给你他们认为你想听到的答案。”可是这招无效，因为没人喜欢虚伪的人。没有人想要伪造的金币。

一位公交车司机的女儿付出了很大代价才学到这个道理。她梦想成为一名歌手，然而不幸的是，她嘴很大还长着龅牙。第一次在公开场合——新泽西的一个夜店演唱时，她尽量伸长上嘴唇试图盖住牙齿，她想表现得魅力四射。结果呢？她把自己弄得很可笑，这注定将失败。

不过夜店里的一位男士听到她的歌声后认为她很有天赋，于是直白地对她说：“是这样的。我一直观察着你的演出，我知道你想隐藏什么。你不好意思露出你的牙齿！”女孩很难为情，但男人继续说道：“那又怎样？长了龅牙又犯了什么罪吗？别试图藏起它们！张开嘴，当观众们看到你并不以此为耻时他们会爱你的。而且……”他机智地说，“你试图遮掩的牙齿或许还是你的财富呢！”

卡斯·戴莉听从了他的建议，抛下了对牙齿的顾忌。从那时起，她的脑中只有观众。她张大嘴巴，带着由衷的兴致与愉悦唱歌，后来成了电影和电台的大明星，一些喜剧演员还试图模仿她呢！

大名鼎鼎的威廉·詹姆斯谈到那些从未找到自我的人时说，一般人只开发了自身能力的10％。“与我们的潜能比较，我们只是半醒的人。我们只用了体能和智力资源的一小部分。概括地说，人类目前为止没有突破个人的局限性，他们拥有很多本领却没能加以运用。”

你和我都具备这样的能力，所以我们不要浪费一秒钟在烦恼上，因为我们不像那些人一样。你是世上的新生事物。有史以来，在你之前从未有过和你一模一样的人；从此之后的世世代代里也不会再有一个同样的你出现。遗传科学告诉我们，你是由父母各自遗传给你的二十三个染色体形成的。这四十六个染色体决定了你的全部基因。阿姆拉姆·善菲尔德说：“每个染色体中都有几十到几百个基因——而有时一个基因就能改变一个机体的整个生命。”的确，生命的形成是“令人畏惧而又奇妙”的。

在父母孕育的过程中，你成形的概率只有三百万亿分之一！也就是说，假如你有三百万亿个兄弟姐妹，没有一个会与你完全相同。这都是猜测吗？不，这都是科学事实。如果你想了解更多相关知识，请参考阿姆拉姆·善菲尔德所著的《你与遗传》一书。

在做自己这个话题上我坚定不移地支持，因为我感同身受。我知道自己在说什么——我付出了苦楚而巨大的代价。举个例子来说吧，当我第一次走出密苏里的玉米田来到纽约时，我报名加入了美国戏剧学院，我一心想成为演员。我以为自己的主意棒极了，这是一个成功的捷径，我好奇如此简单而又万无一失的想法怎么成千上万的有志之士都没有想到过呢？我的主意是这样的：我会学习约翰·德鲁、沃尔特·汉普登、欧提斯·斯金纳等当时知名演员的演技，然后模仿他们每个人的亮点，并把自己变成一个闪亮、成功的明星组合体。多么愚蠢！多么荒唐！我浪费了人生中几年的时间去模仿别人，最后我那厚厚的密苏里脑壳终于想通了：我应该做我自己——其实也根本无法做别人。

这令人沮丧的经历按说应该给了我深深的教训，但是没有。我太愚蠢了，于是又重蹈覆辙。几年以后，我准备写一本关于商界人士演说技巧的书，以为它会成为同类中最好的书。而对于这本书我犯了和当初想演戏时同样的错误：我想把所有同类书籍中的好想法全都借鉴进来，写成一本无所不包的书。所以我找到一大堆关于演说的书，用了一年的时间把里面的想法融汇到我的稿子里，然而我最终再次意识到我又做了愚蠢的行为。这种他人思想的大杂烩读起来既不自然又很无趣，没有商界人士会读完这样一本书。所以我把一年的心血丢进了垃圾桶，重新来过。这次我告诉自己：“你只能是戴尔·卡耐基，不论有怎样的缺点和局限性。你根本不可能成为其他人。”于是我不再试图成为其他人的混合体，我卷起袖管，做了从一开始就该做的事。我用自己的经历、观察以及身为演说技巧讲师所形成的观点写了一本关于演说的教科书。我永远都会记得（也希望自己做到如此）瓦尔特·罗利爵士带给我们的教诲：“我无法写出莎士比亚那样的书，但我能写属于我自己的书。”（这里的瓦尔特·罗利爵士不是把自己的外衣扔在泥地里以供女皇行走的那个人，而是1904年牛津大学的英文文学系教授。）

做自己，厄文·博林给晚辈乔治·格什温的忠告适合我们每个人。当博林和格什温初见时，博林已经名声大振，而格什温还是一个在锡盘巷(1)为了每周赚三十五美金而苦苦奋斗的年轻的歌曲创作者。格什温的才华给博林留下了深刻印象，于是博林邀请格什温担任他的音乐秘书，并开出了相当于之前三倍的工资。博林又建议道：“不过别接受这份工作，否则你会成为二流的博林。但你若坚持做自己，有一天你会成为一流的格什温。”

格什温一直把这个警告放在心上，后来逐渐成了美国那一代中最具影响力的作曲家。

查理·卓别林、威尔·罗杰斯、玛丽·玛格丽特·麦克布莱德、吉恩·奥特里等众多的人都得到了我在本章中一再强调的经验教训，也都像我一样付出了代价。

卓别林刚拍电影时，导演坚持要求他模仿一个德国著名喜剧演员，因而卓别林在决定演出自己的特色之前事业毫无进展。鲍勃·霍普也有类似的经历：他又唱又演了好几年都没有成绩，直到有一天开始说段子、做自己才走红。威尔·罗杰斯在歌舞杂耍表演中默默转绳子好几年，后来他发现了自己独特的喜剧天赋，凭着边转绳子边说话才出了名。

玛丽·玛格丽特·麦克布莱德刚上广播电台时曾试图表现成一名爱尔兰喜剧演员但不成功。而当她只去做自己——一个普通的密苏里乡下女孩时，她成了纽约最受欢迎的广播明星之一。

吉恩·奥特里想方设法掩饰自己的得克萨斯口音，并把自己打扮得像个纽约男孩，宣称自己是纽约人，人们都在背后笑话他的做法。而当他拨起班卓琴，唱起牛仔民谣时，他的职业生涯的大门打开了。他成了大银幕上和广播里闻名世界的牛仔。

你是世界上崭新的个体。记住这一点并为此高兴吧。最大限度地实现大自然赋予你的一切。归根结底，一切艺术都是自传。你只能以自己的角度唱歌、画画。你必定是你的经历、环境和基因塑造的。不论好坏，你必须培育自己的小花园，必须在人生交响乐中奏响自己的乐器。

爱默生一篇随笔《自助》中写道：“每个人在求知的过程中早晚会发现：嫉妒是无知，模仿是自我毁灭；他必须接受自己的好与不好，不论是怎样的比例；虽然大千世界物产富饶，但有营养的玉米只会长在自己辛勤耕种的田地里。每个人被赋予的能量都是崭新的，除了自己以外无人知晓你能做什么，若不尝试你也不会知道。”

而诗人道格拉斯·玛拉赫是这样说的：

如果你不能成为山顶上的一棵松，

那就做山谷中的一株灌木——

但要做溪边最好的那株小灌木；

做不成一棵大树，就做一株灌木。



如果你不能成为一株灌木，那就做一片草地，

把公路点缀出喜悦的色彩；

如果你不能成为狼鱼，那就做一条鲈鱼——

但要做湖中最活跃的那条鲈鱼！



我们不能都做船长，还要有船员，

每个人都有适合的岗位。

工作有大有小，

而必须完成的是眼前的事。



如果你不能成为高速公路，那就做一条羊肠小径。

如果你不能做太阳，那就做星星；

成功不在于大小，

而在于你是否做到最好。




为了培养平和、自由的心态，请记住：

让我们停止模仿他人。

让我们发现自己、做回自己。

第八章　真诚之人，处处受欢迎


为什么要学习一本关于赢得朋友的书？为什么不学学史上最会交朋友的人有怎样的技巧？他是谁？或许明天走在街上你就会见到它。当你走到与它相距十英尺的距离时，它会开始摇尾巴。如果你停下来拍拍它，它几乎要从躯体中跳出来以展示它有多喜欢你。你知道在这种喜爱之情的背后没有任何隐藏的动机：它不想卖房子给你，不想和你结婚。

你有没有想过，狗是唯一不需要干活就能生存的动物？鸡要下蛋，牛要挤奶，金丝雀要唱歌。但狗什么都不用做，只需爱你就能生存。

我五岁的时候，父亲花了五十美分买了一只小黄狗。它是我童年的光芒与喜悦。每天下午大约四点半的时候，它都会坐到前院，美丽的眼睛坚定地盯着马路，一旦听到我的声音或看到我拎着饭盒穿过灌木丛，它都会像脱弓之箭一般一口气冲上小山坡迎接我，它快乐地上蹿下跳，狂喜般汪汪直叫。

五年来，提比是我形影不离的好朋友。后来在一个悲伤的夜晚，我永远也忘不了那个夜晚，它在我面前十尺之遥的地方被闪电击中。它的死是我童年的悲剧。

提比，你从未读过半本心理学书籍，你也不需要读。你凭那神圣的天性就懂得，真心在乎他人两个月比试图让别人对你感兴趣两年交到的朋友要多。我想再重申一遍：真心在乎他人两个月比试图让别人对你感兴趣两年交到的朋友要多。

然而你我都认识那些大张声势地试图让别人对他感兴趣、犯了一辈子这种错误的人。

这自然是行不通的。人们就是对他人不感兴趣。他们只对自己感兴趣，不论是早晨、中午还是晚上。

纽约电话公司做了一项电话对话的调查，意在找出人们最常用的词汇。你猜对了，那就是“我”。我、我、我……这个字眼在五百通电话中出现了三千九百次。

当你在看一张包括你在内的集体照时，首先找的是谁的身影？

如果我们只试图用让人刮目相看的方式赢得关注，将永远交不到一个真正真诚的朋友。真正的友谊不是这样形成的。

拿破仑试过了，而当他见约瑟芬最后一面时，他说：“约瑟芬，我曾比世界上很多人要幸运，然而在这一刻里，你是我唯一可以信赖的人。”不过史学家怀疑拿破仑是否连她都不能信任。

著名的维也纳心理学家阿尔弗雷德·阿德勒在《生活对你意味着什么》一书中说道：“那些对他人不感兴趣的人在生活中面对着巨大困难，也给他人带去最多的伤害。人类的一切失败都源于这样的人。”

你可以读一卷又一卷的深奥的心理学书籍，但对于你来说没有任何一句话比这句更重要。阿德勒的话意义深远，我再次强调：

那些对他人不感兴趣的人在生活中面对着巨大困难，也给他人带去最多的伤害。人类的一切失败都源于这样的人。

我曾在纽约大学上过一门短篇写作的课程。一位知名杂志社的编辑曾到我们班上进行讲座。他说他可以随意拿起一篇每天堆在他桌上的故事，只要读几段就能看出这个作者是否对他人感兴趣。“如果一个作者对别人不感兴趣，那么读者也不会喜欢他写的故事。”

这位犀利的编辑在说到如何进行虚构类写作时曾两度停下来讲道。他说：“我跟你们说，就如牧师会跟你们说的那样——记住，你一定要关心别人才能写出好故事。”

如果这对写小说有效，那你也可以确信，在面对面与人交往时亦是如此。

霍华德·萨士顿上次在百老汇表演时，我在后台待了一个晚上。萨士顿是公认的魔术大师，他四十年里去过无数国家，一次又一次地使用魔术手法去迷惑观众，使人目瞪口呆。超过六千万人曾掏钱看过他的表演，而他赚了差不多两百万美金。

我请萨士顿先生告诉我他成功的秘密。他的成功与他所受的学校教育肯定是无关的，因为他从小离家出走，过着流浪者的生活。他自己搭货车、睡草堆、挨家挨户乞讨食物，通过看车外的路标学会识字。

他对魔术有着更深层的知识吗？没有。他告诉我，关于魔术的书有上百本，会的魔术和他一样多的人也有一大群。而他有两样别人没有的东西。首先，他能在聚光灯下表现出自己的个性。他是一个表演大师，他懂得人性。他做的每一件事、每个动作、声音中的每个抑扬顿挫、眉梢的每次扬起都是设计过的，而这些表演精准到每一毫秒。此外，萨士顿还真正地对他人感兴趣。他说，很多魔术师在面对观众时心里会想：“坐在台下的是一群傻瓜，我肯定能把他们骗倒。”然而萨士顿的方式完全不同。他告诉我，每次在台上时他都对自己说：“我很感激这些来看我表演的人。是他们成全了我这颇受欢迎的谋生手段。我会为他们而尽全力表演。”

他宣称，他每次走上舞台之前都会对自己不断重复：“我爱我的观众。我爱我的观众。”这很可笑吗？很荒唐吗？你怎么想都行，我只是在向你转述大魔术师的成功秘诀。

宾夕法尼亚州北华伦市的乔治·戴克被迫关闭他开的休息站，提前退休，因为新建的高速公路将占用原休息站的地盘。退休的生活十分空闲，很快，他便感到无聊难耐，于是他拾起了那把旧的小提琴，用拉琴来打发时间。不久后，他开始四处游走、听音乐会，和不少颇有成就的小提琴手聊天。性格谦逊友好的他对遇到的每个音乐人的背景都打心眼里感兴趣。虽然他自己琴拉得不好，却结识了很多志同道合的朋友。他参加各种比赛，后来在美国东部乡村音乐爱好者中出了名，人们叫他“来自金爪郡的小提琴手乔治大叔”。我们听到乔治大叔演奏时，他已七十二岁，继续享受着生命的每分每秒。在大多数人认为不会再有作为的年纪里，他通过对别人的持续性关注为自己创造了新的人生。

这其实也是西奥多·罗斯福异常受人欢迎的秘诀。就连他的侍者都爱戴他。他的男仆詹姆斯·E．阿莫斯写了一本关于罗斯福的书，名叫《西奥多·罗斯福——仆人眼中的英雄》。在书中阿莫斯写到了这样一件引人深思的事：

我的妻子有一次向总统询问有关美洲鹑的事。她从来没见过美洲鹑，总统就对她描述了一遍。后来我们屋的电话响了（阿莫斯和妻子住在牡蛎湾罗斯福庄园的一间小屋里），我妻子接了电话，是罗斯福先生亲自打来的。他说他打电话是为了告诉我妻子，我们屋外现在就有一只美洲鹑，如果我们从窗口看出去就有可能看到。类似的小事使他散发着无穷魅力。每次他路过我们的房间时，即便看不到我们也会打招呼：“哦哦哦，是安妮吗？”或者“哦哦哦，是詹姆斯吗？”这就是他路过时的问候。

下属们怎会不喜欢这样的人呢？任何一个人都不可能不喜欢这样的人吧！

一天，塔夫脱总统和夫人都不在白宫里，罗斯福去白宫造访。他对白宫的每个侍者打招呼，并叫出他们的名字，哪怕只是对一个洗碗工。他对下人的真心喜爱就是这么表现出来的。

阿尔奇·巴特写道：“当他看见厨房女仆爱丽丝时，他问她是否还做玉米面包。爱丽丝说她有时会为下人们做，楼上是不吃的。

“‘他们品位太差。’罗斯福用他那浑厚的声音说，‘下次我见到总统时会亲自告诉他。’

“爱丽丝用盘子盛了一片给他，他就端到办公室里准备享用。一路上还不忘和园丁、劳工打招呼……

“他像以往一样和每个人打招呼。在白宫做了四十年守卫的艾克·胡佛含泪说：‘那是我们近两年来唯一的快乐日子，我们每个人都不会同意用一百美元换走这样的一天。’”

关心看似不重要的人也同样帮助新泽西查塔姆市的销售代表爱德华·M．塞克斯保住了一个客户。他说：“多年前，我为强生公司管理麻省的客户，其中的一个客户是欣厄姆市的一家杂货店。每次到这家店和经理谈话或接订单前，我都会与饮料贩卖员工和销售员工聊上几分钟。有一天，我走进去后经理让我离开，并告诉我不会再订强生的产品，因为他认为强生在食品和打折店搞的活动损害了杂货店的利益。我只得灰溜溜地离开，开着车在小镇里转了几个钟头。但最后我决定返回杂货店，至少要试着向经理解释我们的立场。

“当我回到店里时，照常跟饮料贩卖员工和销售员工打了招呼。当我走到经理面前时，他对我微笑并欢迎我回来，然后给了我双倍的订单。我惊讶地看着他，问这短短几个小时里发生了什么。他指了指饮料贩卖员，说我走后那个男孩告诉他我是那么多商家中唯一真诚地和他还有其他店员说话的人。他跟经理说，如果有任何商家值得他打交道，那就是我了。经理同意了，继续当我们的忠实客户。此后我永远记得，对于销售人员乃至每个人来说，对他人真诚的关心是最重要的品质。”

我的亲身经历告诉我，如果我们能展现对他人真诚的兴趣，便能从任何人那里得到关注、时间与配合，不论对方是多么德高望重。以下便是我的亲身经历。

几年前，我在布鲁克林艺术与科学学院办了一门文学写作课程。我们想邀请凯瑟琳·诺瑞诗、范妮·赫斯特、艾达·塔贝尔、阿尔伯特·佩森·特修和鲁珀特·休斯等著名又繁忙的作家来布鲁克林讲他们的经验，从而使学生更好地进步。所以我们给这些作者写信，说我们很仰慕他们的作品，对得到他们的建议并学习他们的成功秘诀有很深的兴趣。

每一封信都有150个学生的签名。我们在信中说知道对方很忙，或许忙到没时间准备演讲内容，所以我们随信寄去一系列他们可以准备的问题，都是有关作家本人及其工作方式的。这种做法受到了作家们的喜爱。谁又会不喜欢呢？所以他们离家来到了布鲁克林，给予我们充分的帮助。

我也曾用同样的方法成功说服了罗斯福内阁财政部长莱斯利·M．肖、塔夫脱内阁司法部长乔治·W．威克沙姆、威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩、富兰克林·D．罗斯福等德高望重的人，请他们到我的那些演讲培训班为学生们讲话。

每一个人，不论是工厂工人、办公室员工还是当权的国王，都喜欢赏识自己的人。德国皇帝就可以作为例子。在第一次世界大战的末期，他大概成了这个地球上最被鄙视和憎恶的人了。连他自己的国家都把他当作敌人，所以他不得不逃亡到荷兰。人们对他的憎恨实在太强烈了，无数的人想把他撕成一片片或者绑在柱子上烧死。在这一片怒骂中，一个小男孩给皇帝写了一封简单、诚恳的信，信中充满了友好与尊敬。小男孩说，不论别人怎么想，他永远会把威廉当作他的皇帝，敬爱他。皇帝被这封信深深打动，并邀请小男孩来见他。小男孩来了，他的母亲也来了，后来威廉娶了她为妻。这个小男孩不必阅读有关赢得朋友、影响他人的书，他本能地懂得如何去做。

如果我们想交到朋友，就要甘愿为他人做事——做那些需要时间、精力、思虑和无私精神的事。当温莎公爵还是威尔士亲王时，他曾计划访问南美，而在走访之前，他花了几个月时间学习西班牙文，为的是能用那些国家的语言进行公开演讲。而南美人也因此十分爱戴他。

多年来我一直特意询问朋友的生日。我是怎么询问的呢？虽然我对占星术是一点都不信，但我会问对方是否相信生日与性格、性情的关系，然后让他们告诉我自己的生辰日期。假如对方说11月24日，我会在心里默念：11月24日，11月24日。等朋友一转身，我会马上写下来他的生日，回家后抄在一个生日簿上。每年伊始，我都会把这些生日抄到每日记事本上，这样我便能自动注意到朋友的生日了。当那天到来时，他们就会收到我的信或电报。每一次他们都会特别开心！我常常是唯一一个记得某些人生日的人。

如果想交到朋友，让我们热情洋溢地跟人打招呼。接电话时也是一样。说“你好”时要表达出你接到对方电话的喜悦。很多公司都训练他们的电话接线员用充满兴趣和热情的口吻接听每个人的电话，这样的话打电话的人会觉得这家公司在乎他。今后接打电话时请记得这一点。

表达对他人真诚的关心不仅能赢得朋友，还有可能培养起客户的忠诚度。在纽约的北美国家银行出版的刊物中印有这样一封来自储蓄者马德琳·罗丝黛尔的信件：

我希望贵公司知道我对你们的职员是多么的感激。每个人都那么彬彬有礼、乐于助人。在排了那么久的长队后，有那么热情的出纳员接待你是多么令人愉悦的事。

去年我的母亲住院五个月。每次我总是到出纳玛丽·佩楚奇罗那里办理业务，而她很关心我的母亲，常常询问她的近况。

毫无疑问，罗丝黛尔女士会继续和这家银行打交道。

纽约市一家大银行员工查尔斯·R．沃特斯被要求准备一份关于某公司的机密报告。他知道只有一个人拥有他正急切需要的信息，于是沃特斯先生去到了那位总裁的办公室里。这时一个年轻女人把头探了进来，告诉总裁今天她没有邮票可以给他。

“我在帮我二十岁的儿子集邮。”那位总裁向沃特斯先生解释道。

沃特斯先生讲了他此行的目的，然后就开始问问题，但总裁的话含糊、笼统而且模棱两可。他不想说话，并且看似没什么方法能让他说话。这次访谈简短而空洞。

沃特斯在班里讲这个故事时说：“老实说，我实在是没办法了。后来我想起来了他秘书提到的事——邮票及十二岁的儿子……我还想起来我们银行的国际部门在收集邮票——那里有来自五湖四海的信。

“第二天下午我给这个人打了电话，转告他我有邮票要给他儿子。我被笑脸相迎了吗？没错。他和我握手时的热情就像在竞选国会议员一般——有过之而无不及。他散发着微笑与友善。‘我的乔治会爱这张邮票的，’他一边翻阅着邮票一边说，‘还有这张！这真是太宝贵了。’

“我们用了半个小时的时间看邮票、看他儿子的照片，然后他用了超过一个小时的时间告诉了我所有我需要的信息——我连问都没问。他告诉了我他所知道的全部，还把他的下属叫来并打电话给几个同事进行询问。他给了我大量事实、数据、报告和信件。用媒介的说法就是，我得到了‘有料’的信息。”

下面是另外一个例子：

费城的小C．M．耐弗里多年来一直想卖石油给一家大型连锁机构，而那家公司一直从外地的商家进油，每次运油车都从耐弗里的公司门口路过。一天晚上，耐弗里先生在我的一个培训班中当着所有人面宣泄出对大型连锁店的愤怒，骂他们是国家的祸害。

然而他还是好奇为何自己没能把油卖给他们。

我建议他尝试另一种方式。简单地说，事情是这样子的。我们在培训班里办了一场辩论，内容是连锁店的兴起为国家带来的伤害是否多于利益。

在我的建议下，耐弗里加入了反方，要为连锁店做辩护。于是他直接找到了那位他一直鄙视的连锁店的总裁，对他说：“我不是来卖石油的。我想请你帮我一个忙。”他向对方解释了我们的辩论，“我来请求你的帮助，因为我觉得除了你没有第二个人能给我我所需要的信息了。我特别想赢这场辩论。我会深深地感激你给我的任何帮助的。”

之后的故事用耐弗里的原话描述是这样的：

“我只向他索要一分钟的时间。也是在这个前提下，他答应了我的请求。听完事情的缘由后，他示意我坐下，然后我们的谈话持续了一个小时四十七分钟。他还请了另外一位总裁进来，这个人曾写过关于连锁店的书。他还给全国连锁店协会写信，让他们寄给我一份关于这个话题已有的辩论记录。他觉得连锁店是真正服务于人类的产物，他为自己在上百个社区中的服务而自豪。他说话时两眼放光，而我必须承认，他让我大开眼界，知道了之前从未想过的事。他改变了我的整个态度。

“临走时，他把我送到门口，把手臂搭在我的肩上，祝我在辩论中取得好成绩，还让我告诉他辩论的结果。他对我说的最后一句话是：‘晚春时再来找我，那时我会下单买你们的石油。’

“对我来说，这简直是一个奇迹。这一次我连问都没问，他就主动提出购买我们的石油。在我真心关注他和他的问题的这两个小时里，我所取得的进展比试图让他对我的产品感兴趣的十年里还要多。”

耐弗里的事例表明，你并没有发现新大陆。在耶稣诞生的数百年前，一位罗马诗人就说过：“关心他人，才能得到他人的关心。”

你所表示出的关心必须是真诚的——就如人际关系中的其他准则一样。表示关心的一方不能是唯一的受益者；对方也应该从中受益。这是一件互利的事。

在纽约长岛参加培训班的马丁·金斯伯格讲起过一位护士对他的关心是如何彻底改变他的生活的：

“那天是感恩节，我十岁。我住在医院的福利病房，第二天要接受外科手术。我知道接下来的几个月里我都会在病房中度过，慢慢康复，但充满痛苦。我的父亲去世了，母亲和我住在一家小公寓里，靠福利救济。那天妈妈不能来看我。

“我慢慢被孤独、绝望和恐惧吞噬。我知道妈妈肯定独自在家为我担心，没人陪伴她，没人与她一同用餐，她也没有钱吃一顿感恩节大餐。

“我的眼泪涌上了眼眶，我把头埋在被子里默默流泪，默默但凄苦地流泪，整个身体都颤抖了起来。

“一位年轻的实习护士听到哭声走了过来，她把被子从我的脸上掀起，为我擦眼泪。她告诉我她也很寂寞，她在节日里要上班，不能和家人团聚。然后她问我是否愿意和她一起用餐并拿来两盘食物：切片的火鸡肉、土豆泥、红莓酱，还有当甜点的冰淇淋。她一直和我说话，试着抚慰我心中的恐惧。虽然她下午四点就该下班了，但她一直陪着我直到将近晚上十一点。她和我玩游戏、聊天，直到我睡着才离开。

“之后我又度过了一个又一个的感恩节，每次我都会想起十岁的那个感恩节以及那时失意、恐惧、孤独的感受，还有来自陌生人的温暖和温柔——她神奇般地使一切不那么难以承受了。”




如果你希望他人喜欢你，想拥有真正的友谊，想在帮助他人时自己也有所收获，请记住这条准则：

真诚地关心他人！





第九章　与人交往的最大秘密


天底下只有一种让别人做事的方法。你是否停下来想过这个问题？是的，只有一种。那就是让对方愿意做这件事。

记住，再没有其他的方式。

当然，你可以用枪口顶着对方的脑袋，让他给你手表。你也可以用威胁开除员工的方式使他为你的企业努力工作。你可以用打骂的方式让小孩做你想让他做的事。然而这些原始的方式都有极度不利的后果。

我能让你做任何事的唯一方式就是给你你想要的。

你想要什么？

西格蒙德·弗洛伊德说过，每个人做事只有两个动机：性冲动和渴望卓越。

美国影响最深远的哲学家之一约翰·杜威却有不同的观点。他说人性最根本的需求是“对重要感的追求”。请记住这几个字：“对重要感的追求”。这很重要。你在此书中会多次听到这些字。

你想要什么？好像不多，但你对少数几样东西的渴望是势不可挡的。大多数人渴望的东西包括：

1．健康长寿

2．食物

3．睡眠

4．金钱以及金钱可以买到的东西

5．永生

6．性满足

7．子孙的幸福

8．重要感

这几乎都能被满足，除了一个。但是还有一种渴求——几乎和对食物与睡眠的渴求一样深切与急迫——却很少被满足。那就是弗洛伊德所说的“渴望卓越”，即约翰·杜威所说的“对重要感的追求”。

林肯曾在一封信的开头写道：“每个人都喜欢被称赞。”威廉·詹姆士说过：“人性最基本的规律便是对称赞的渴求。”注意，他并没有说对称赞的需要或欲望，而是说对它的“渴求”。

这就是令人苦恼却又不懈追求的人性欲望，而有能力真正满足这种心之所向的少数人便是把他人掌握在股掌中了。但“即便是这些操纵者，在临死前也会有遗憾”。

“对重要感的追求”是人和动物的区别之一。比如说：当我还是密苏里农场里的小男孩时，我爸爸养殖着品种优良的杜洛克大红猪和纯种白面牛。我们还会到中西部的乡村展览和牲口秀上展示我们的猪和牛，并得了好几次第一名。我爸爸把他的所有蓝缎荣誉钉在一块白布上，亲朋好友来访时，他会拿出长长的白布给他们看。每次展示蓝缎时，他都拿着白布的一端，而我拿着另一端。

那些猪不在意它们赢得的荣誉，但是爸爸在意。这些奖章给了他重要感。

如果我们的祖先没有这种对重要感的热切渴望，人类文明便不会诞生。没有文明，我们和动物之间也就没多大差别了。

这种对重要感的渴望让狄更斯写下了不朽的篇章；这种渴望使克里斯多夫·雷恩爵士砌出了石头的交响曲；这种渴望令洛克菲勒积攒了他一辈子也花不完的千百万美金。而这种渴望也让你的城镇里最富裕的家庭建起了超出实际需要的大房子。

这种渴望支配着你——你想要穿最流行的衣服，开最新款的车，并不厌其烦地夸赞你那聪明的孩子。

这种渴望也引诱了很多少男少女加入帮派，从事犯罪活动。据纽约市前公安局局长所说，一般的年轻犯罪分子都有很强的自我意识，被关押后的第一个要求便是让那些不靠谱的小报把他们报道成大英雄。令人不悦的监禁生活对他们来讲并不要紧，只要他们能心满意足地看着自己的头像和体育明星、影视明星以及政治家出现在同一个版面上。

如果你能告诉我你是如何获取重要感的，我就能告诉你你是怎样的人。这决定了你的人格，是关于你的最重要的信息。比如，约翰·D．洛克菲勒获取重要感的方式是通过捐钱为中国北京建立一座现代医院，照料成千上万他不曾见到也不会见到的穷苦人。相反的，迪林杰通过做一名土匪、强盗和杀手而得到重要感。当联邦调查局特工追捕他时，他闯入明尼苏达的一个农家并宣布：“我是迪林杰！”他对于自己是国民头号公敌而感到骄傲。“我不会伤害你，不过我是迪林杰！”他这样说道。

没错，洛克菲勒和迪林杰的首要区别便是他们获取重要感的方式。

历史上名人努力获取重要感的闪光例子数不胜数。就连乔治·华盛顿都让别人称自己为“至高无上的美国总统”。哥伦布为自己争取了头衔：“海军上将、印度总督”；凯萨琳女皇拒绝拆阅任何没有注明“女王陛下”敬语的信件；而林肯夫人和格兰特夫人翻脸时像母老虎一样吼叫道：“没有我的邀请你怎敢坐在我的眼前！”

1928年，我们的百万富翁们资助了海军上将伯德的南极探险，而条件是要以他们的名字命名冰山。维克多·雨果渴望巴黎以自己的名字重新命名，以表达对他的敬意。就连莎士比亚——至高无上的代表，都希望为自己的家庭赢得一枚盾徽从而为自己的名字增辉。

有时人们还会用无能来获取同情和关注，从而得到重要感。比如说麦金莱夫人就是以此种方式获得重要感的。她强迫她的丈夫——一位美国总统——抛下国家大事，陪她在床上一躺就是几个小时，抱着她、哄她入睡。她拔牙时都需要丈夫陪伴左右从而获取重要感，当丈夫因赶赴与国务卿约翰·海伊的会议离开时，她便公然大吵大闹。

作家玛丽·罗伯特·莱因哈特曾经给我讲过一位聪明、强壮的年轻女人是如何为了获取重要感而失去行动能力的故事。莱因哈特夫人说：“有一天，这个女人被迫面对了一些事实，或许是她的年龄。她发现前方是漫长的孤独岁月，也对一切失去了期待。

“她躺到床上，卧床不起。而在之后的十年里，她的母亲要往返于三层楼间，端着盘子照顾她。然后有一天这位老母亲累倒了，很快便与世长辞。接下来的几周内，这个‘病人’越来越憔悴，直到有一天，她站起身来，穿上衣服，重新开始生活。”

一些权威人士说，如果一个人对重要感的渴望在残忍的现实中无法被满足，那么他有可能会疯掉，从而在疯狂的世界里找到满足。在美国，精神病患者比其他所有疾病患者的总和还要多。

精神病是什么导致的？

没有人能回答这么大的问题，但是我们知道有些疾病，例如梅毒，会毁坏脑细胞，导致精神病。实际上，一半的精神病是由物理伤害引起的，比如脑损伤、酒精中毒以及其他外伤。然而另一半精神病患者的脑细胞并没有生理病变——这才是更令人震惊的现象。检验时，他们的脑细胞经过高倍显微镜的观察，并没有显示出有何异常。

这些人又是怎么患上精神病的呢？

我向最著名的精神病院主治医师询问过这个问题。这位医生曾经在专业领域获得过最高荣誉和令人仰慕的殊荣，而他坦白地告诉我，他也不知道人们为何会疯掉。没人能准确地知道。但他也说到，很多人在疯癫的世界里找到了从前在现实世界中不曾拥有的重要感。然后他给我讲了下面的这个故事：

“我现在有一位患者，她的婚姻已被证明是个悲剧。她希望得到爱、性满足、小孩和社会名望，然而生活浇灭了她所有的希望。她的丈夫不爱她，甚至拒绝和她一起用餐，并强迫她把饭端到楼上他自己的屋子里。她没有孩子，没有社会地位。她疯了，而在她的幻想中，她和丈夫离婚了，重新使用婚前的名字。她现在认为自己嫁给了英国贵族，并坚持让别人叫她史密斯夫人。

“说到孩子，她现在每晚都认为自己刚生了一个孩子。每次我看望她时她都会对我说：‘医生，我昨晚刚生下一个婴儿。’”

生活曾经把她的梦想之船撞毁在现实的锋利礁石上，但在充满阳光和幻觉的疯癫之岛上，她所有的船都扬帆驶入港口——风儿在帆间歌唱。

听起来很可悲吗？哦，这我不知道。她的医生告诉我：“即使我伸出手就能治好她的病我也不会那样做。现在的她开心多了。”

既然人们如此渴望重要感，甚至愿意在精神病的世界里获取它，想象一下如果我们在正常的世界里给予他人真诚的感恩，那么又将发生怎样的奇迹呢？

美国第一个挣到超过一百万美金年薪的人是查尔斯·施瓦布（那时还没有施行个人所得税，人均一周五十美金已经算是不错的了）。1921年，他被安德鲁·卡耐基任命为新成立的美国钢铁公司的第一任总裁。后来，施瓦布离开了美国钢铁公司，接管了当时问题重重的伯利恒钢铁公司，并使它摇身成为美国最赚钱的公司之一。

为什么安德鲁·卡耐基会付给施瓦布每年一百万美元，或者说每天超过三千美元的薪水？这是为什么呢？因为施瓦布是天才吗？不是。因为他的钢铁业知识比别人过硬？也不是。查尔斯·施瓦布亲口对我说，他手下的很多人对钢铁业的了解比他多得多。

施瓦布说他能得到这样的薪水很大程度上是因为他懂得如何与人交往。我问他是如何做到的。下面是他表述的秘诀，这些话真应该被刻在不朽的铜牌上，挂在陆地上的每个人家、每间学校、每个店铺和每间办公室中。学生们与其花时间背拉丁文的动词形式转换或是巴西的年降雨量，不如熟记下面一段话。这些话会改变你我的生活，如果我们愿意付诸行动。

施瓦布说：“我认为我能激发人们的热情，这种能力是我最宝贵的财富。而激励他人做到最好的方式就是感谢与鼓励。

“没什么比上级的批评更能摧毁一个人的斗志了，我从不批评任何人，我相信给人树立工作动机的重要性。所以我愿意表扬，不愿批评。如果我喜欢一件事，那我会衷心地赞美，并毫不保留赞美之辞。”

这就是施瓦布的做法。而普通人是怎么做的呢？恰恰相反。如果他们不喜欢一件事，他们会痛骂下属；如果他们喜欢一件事，他们却闷不作声。就如一句老话所述：“坏事做一次，听一生；好事做两次，从未闻。”

施瓦布说：“在我与各式各样的人打交道、会见全世界最了不起的人后，还没有遇到一个在批评声中比在赞许声中更加卖力做事的人——不论他多伟大、多尊贵。”

他坦言，这就是安德鲁·卡耐基获得非凡成就的一大显著原因。无论在公开和私下场合，卡耐基都会赞美他的同事。

甚至在自己的墓碑上，卡耐基都不忘赞美同事。他为自己写的墓志铭是这样的：“躺在这里的是一个懂得如何与更聪明的人相处的人。”

真诚的感激也是老洛克菲勒成功与人交往的秘诀。举个例子来说吧，当他的一个合作伙伴爱德华·T．贝德福德轻信了一个南美坏人，使公司亏损了一百万时，洛克菲勒本可以批评他，但他知道贝德福德已经尽力了，且事态已经无法扭转。但是洛克菲勒找到了可以表扬的地方，他恭喜贝德福德挽救了60％的资金。洛克菲勒说：“这太棒了。我们上层管理者有时都做不到这么好。”

我的日记本中还有一个我知道是虚构的故事，但它反映了真理，所以让我把它讲出来吧。

这个荒唐的小故事是这样的：一个农妇在一天辛劳工作后，摆了一堆干草在男人们面前。当他们愤怒地问妇人是不是疯了的时候，她回答：“为什么？我怎么知道你们会注意到？我为你们这些人做了二十年的饭，也没人告诉我吃的不是草。”

几年前，有一项关于妻子离家出走的原因的调查。你认为她们这样做最主要的原因是什么？没错，是“不被感激”。我相信调查离家的男人也会显示同样的结果。我们往往觉得另一半的付出是理所当然的，以至于从未让对方知道我们的感激。

我们训练班上的一个人讲过他妻子提出的一个要求。他的妻子和在教堂结识的一组女友加入了一个自我提高的项目，她让丈夫帮助她列出六个需要改进的地方，以成为更完美的妻子。他对班上的人说：“我为这一要求感到吃惊。老实说，列出六个她能改进的地方很容易。天啊，她能列出一千条我需要改变的地方。但是我没有这样做。我对她说：‘让我仔细想想，明早给你答案。’

“第二天早晨，我很早起床并让花店寄来六朵玫瑰，还附上一段留言：我想不出你需要改进的六个地方。我就爱原本的你。

“猜猜那天晚上回家时谁在门口等我？没错，是我老婆！她几乎热泪盈眶。不用说，我很高兴没有按照她的指示提出改进意见。

“之后的那个周日当她在小组中公布了她的任务结果时，小组中的好几个女人过来跟我说：‘这是我听过的最体贴的事。’就是在那时我意识到了赞美的重要性。”

百老汇最耀眼的制作人弗洛伦茨·齐格菲尔德以具有“把美国女孩变得光彩夺目”的神奇能力而著称，他一次又一次地把毫不起眼的蓬头垢面的小丫头们转变为舞台上充满神秘感与诱惑的夺目风景。他深知赞美与自信的价值，他用他那绅士风度与纯粹的关怀使女孩们觉得自己很美。他的做法很实际，他把歌舞团女孩的薪水从每周30美金提高到最高175美金。他还很懂礼节，在富丽秀的首演之夜，他送了美国美人玫瑰给歌舞团的每个女孩。

有一次我无法抵抗潮流，也尝试斋戒，持续了六天六夜没吃饭。这并不难。到了第六天晚上，我的饥饿感还没有第二天晚上强烈。但你我都知道，如果你让家人或雇员六天不吃饭，那就像是犯罪一样；可是人们会六天、六周甚至六十年不给予他人衷心的赞美，而人们对赞美的渴求并不亚于对食物的渴求。

那个时代的当红演员，饰演了《重聚维也纳》中男主角的阿尔弗雷德·朗特，他说：“我最需要的莫过于自尊的滋养了。”

我们照顾着孩子、朋友和职员的身体，但对他们自尊的关怀又有多少？我们提供烤牛肉和土豆来为他们补充体力，却忘记了给予赞美的话语，而正是这些话语，会像晨星的音乐一样在他们的记忆中长久歌唱。

保罗·哈维在他的一栏广播节目《故事的结局》中说过，表达衷心的赞美能改变人的一生。他在广播中讲述了这样一件事，一年前底特律州的一名老师让史蒂夫·莫里斯帮她找教室里丢失的老鼠，而史蒂夫是个失明的孩子。你看，她欣赏自然赋予史蒂夫的独特能力。自然为了弥补史蒂夫失明的眼睛而使他的听觉变得格外发达，但这是第一次史蒂夫的超能听觉被赏识。多年后的史蒂夫说道，那个赏识之举是他全新生活的开始。从那时起，他不断开发自己的听觉天赋，后来成了70年代伟大的流行歌曲作者和演唱家之一，他的艺名是史提夫·汪达(1)。

我想，一些读者读到这里会不禁说道：“哦，去他的吧！谄媚！奉承！这些我都试过了。对聪明人来说根本不起作用。”

当然，对于有辨识能力的人来说，谄媚很难起作用。它肤浅、自私，也不诚恳。它不该奏效也通常不会奏效。没错，有些人对赞美是如此渴望，甚至愿意为得到赞美而做任何事，就像饥荒中的人会去吃草和鱼饵。

就连维多利亚女王都无法抵抗阿谀奉承。英国首相本杰明·迪斯雷利承认他曾大肆吹捧女王，用他自己的话说，就是“用铲子抹上去厚厚的一层恭维”。然而迪斯雷利是统治过大英帝国的首相里最有教养、最机敏、最灵活的人，他简直就是个政治天才。对他来说奏效的方式对你我来说不一定有用。从长远角度讲，谄媚带来的危害比益处多。谄媚是虚伪的，就像假钞一样，一旦使它流通，早晚会给你惹麻烦。

赞美与谄媚有什么不同呢？这很简单就能区分开来。一个是真诚的，一个是虚伪的。一个发自内心，一个出自牙缝。一个无私，一个自私。一个被所有人钦佩，一个被所有人鄙夷。

我最近在墨西哥城查普特佩克宫看到了墨西哥英雄阿尔瓦洛·奥博雷贡将军的半身像，雕像下刻有奥博雷贡将军的一句至理名言：“别畏惧攻击你的敌人，要畏惧奉承你的朋友。”

难道之前我不是在鼓吹奉承吗？不！不！不！赞美与奉承相差甚远！我讲的是一种新的生活方式。让我重复一遍——新的生活方式。

乔治五世国王在白金汉宫的墙上陈列了六条箴言，其中一条便是：“教给我不要给予和接受廉价的赞扬。”廉价的赞扬——这才是奉承的全部。我曾经读到过一条“奉承”的定义，值得复述：“奉承是准确地告诉对方他对自己的看法。”

拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生说：“不论运用何种语言，你说的话都能反映你是什么样的人。”

如果我们只渴求谄媚，每个人都能很快学会，那样的话我们就都成了人际关系的高手了。

当我们没有在思考具体问题时，95％的时候都是在想与自己有关的事。如果我们少想想自己，多想想对方，我们就不用进行廉价而荒谬的谄媚了。其实在你张口谄媚前对方就早已把你看穿了。

日常生活中，我们最缺乏的美德便是赞美。不知为何，当我们的子女考了好成绩回家时，我们忘了表扬他们；当他们第一次成功烤出一个蛋糕或是做出一个鸟屋时，我们忘了鼓励他们。对于孩子来说，没有什么比家长的关注和认同更能令他们欢呼雀跃的了。

下次当你在会所享受了一块菲力牛排后，请把对厨艺的赞美转达给厨师；当一个疲惫的销售员对你格外彬彬有礼时，也请做出相应的称赞。

每个官员、讲师和公共讲演者都明白，对观众掏心掏肺却没有得到一丝赞许的回应，这多么令人泄气。对于专业人士来讲已然如此，那么对办公室、商店和工厂里的工人以及我们的家人和朋友来讲则更是如此。在人际交往中，我们要永远记住，每个和我们打交道的都是人，都有对赞许的渴求。这是每个灵魂都欣然接受的通用货币。

试着在你的每日轨迹中洒满赞美的火花，你会惊讶地发现，你种下的友谊火种在你下一次路过时早已成为了玫瑰色的篝火。

康涅狄格州费尔菲尔德市的帕梅拉·邓纳姆每日工作中的一个任务就是监管一名工作做得很糟糕的清洁工。其他员工会嘲笑这个清洁工，并把垃圾撒在过道里，以表示对他工作的不满。他的情况太糟糕，以至于浪费了店里许多的工作时间。

帕梅拉试过多种方式来鼓励这名清洁工，但都以失败收场。她发现这个人有时会把一小部分工作做得非常好，于是她特意当众表扬了他。后来，他的整体工作越做越好，不久便能高效完成他所有的任务了。现在，他工作更加出色，人们也给予了他赞赏与认可。诚恳的称赞解决了批评和嘲笑所不能解决的问题。

伤害他人不但无法改变他，还永远不受欢迎。我把一句老话贴在了我的镜子上，每天都会不自觉地看到它：

这条路我只能走一次，如果我能为任何人做些有益的事，对任何人表示善意，那就让我立刻行动。不要等待也不要怠慢，因为这条路我只能走一次。

爱默生说过：“我遇到的每个人在某些方面都比我强，都是我的导师。”

如果对爱默生都是如此，那么对你和我来说，这话更是有千百倍的道理了。让我们少想想自己的成就和需求，试图多发现他人的优点。让我们忘记谄媚这件事，诚实、诚恳地给予赞美。“真心地称赞，不吝惜赞美之词”，人们便会珍视你说的话，不仅珍藏它们，并一辈子想着它——在你已然忘记的时候依然会重复着你说过的话。




请给予诚实、诚恳的赞美。

第十章　如何让人们立刻喜欢上你


我正在纽约三十三街和第八大道交口的邮局排队寄挂号信，我发现邮局员工看上去对工作有些不耐烦。称重、贴邮票、找钱、打印收据，他们年复一年、日复一日重复着同样的动作。但是我对自己说：“我要试着让这个员工喜欢我。显然，为了让他喜欢我，我得说些好听的话——当然是关于他的而不是关于自己的。”于是我问自己：“在他身上有什么我真正羡慕的东西呢？”这个问题有时很难回答，尤其是面对着陌生人的时候。但在当前的情形中，回答这个问题恰好很容易。我瞬间就发现了自己羡慕得不得了的东西。

所以当他在给我的信称重时，我热情地对他说：“我真希望我有你那么好的头发。”

他抬起头，显得有点吃惊，随即脸上浮现出微笑。他谦虚地说：“已经不如从前喽。”我向他保证道，即便或许不像以前那么油亮，也依然让人羡慕。他听完很高兴，我们接着进行了简短的对话，最后他对我说：“很多人都羡慕我的头发呢。”

我打赌那个人中午出去吃饭时肯定高兴得手舞足蹈。我保证他当晚回家会向他妻子说起这件事。我相信他一定会对着镜子里的自己说：“我的头发真是不错。”

有一次，我公开讲了这个故事，之后一个人问我：“你想从他那儿得到什么呢？”

我想从他那儿得到什么？！我想从他那儿得到什么！！！

如果我们自私到如此严重的地步，就连传递小小的开心、表达小小的欣赏时还必须得到回报，说明我们的灵魂还没有酸沙果大，那么我们将注定得到我们应得的失败。

哦！没错，我的确想从那个朋友那儿得到些什么。我想要一种无价的东西，而我得到了。我感觉到了为对方做点什么但不求回报的快感。这是一种事后依然久久在你记忆中流淌和歌唱的感受。

人类行为中有一个最重要的法则，如果我们遵从了这个法则便几乎永远不会陷入麻烦，而且能收获无数朋友和恒久的快乐，但一旦违背了这个法则便会遇到无尽的麻烦。这法则就是：永远要让对方感觉到他的重要。就如我们之前提到过的约翰·杜威的话：“重要感是人性最根本的需求。”还有威廉·詹姆士的话：“人性最基本的规律便是对称赞的渴求。”就如我之前所述，这种渴求是人类和动物之间的区别。这种渴求也是文明诞生的基石。

哲学家千百年来一直探索着人际关系的法则，而在一切推断中只有一个法则是最重要的。这并不是新的发现，有史以来就有了它。两千五百年前，琐罗亚斯德就对波斯的门徒传授过这个法则；两千四百年前，孔夫子就在中国讲授过这个法则；两千五百年前，老子在函谷关也讲过这个道理；在耶稣诞生的五百年前，佛祖就在恒河边布过此道；此前一千年，印度的圣书里也印着同样的道理；一千九百年前，耶稣在犹大石山里也总结出了这个法则。这个世上最重要的法则就是：希望如何被对待，就该如何待他人（己所不欲，勿施于人）。

你希望接触过的人能够肯定你，你希望你的价值能被认可，你想要在你的小世界中感觉自己很重要。你不想听廉价、虚伪的奉承，对真诚的赞赏如饥似渴。你希望朋友和同事能够“真诚地赞美，并不吝赞美之词。”——就如查尔斯·施瓦布所说的那样。我们每个人都想要这些。

所以，让我们遵从黄金法则：“希望如何被对待，就该如何待他人。”

怎么做？在什么时候做？在什么地方做？答案是：随时随地。

威斯康星州欧克莱尔市的大卫·G．史密斯曾在培训班里讲过他是如何处理一个微妙的情形的。那时他被要求负责一个公益音乐会的饮料安排。

“音乐会那晚，我赶到公园里，看到两位女士面色难看地站在饮料桌旁，原来她俩都认为自己是当晚负责饮料桌的人。我正在思考如何是好，这时赞助方的人过来递给我一个收款盒，并感谢我答应接管饮料事宜。他把罗丝和珍介绍给我为我当助手，然后就走开了。

“接下来又是一阵沉默。我意识到收钱盒是一种权力的象征（从某个角度来讲），就把它交给了罗丝，并告诉她我可能管不好钱，如果她能负责收钱我就放心了。然后我让珍教被派来帮忙的两个年轻学生如何操作饮料机，并让她负责所有饮料机相关的事宜。

“结果那个晚上大家过得非常愉快。罗丝高兴地数着钱，珍指导着两个少年操作饮料机，而我享受着音乐会。”

你不必等到当上法国大使或是社交委员会主席时才开始使用感激之词。你每天都可以施展它的魔力。

比如说，你在餐馆点了薯条，而服务员端来了土豆泥，让我们这样说：“不好意思给你添麻烦了，但是我们点的是薯条。”她很可能会回答：“一点都不麻烦”，然后会愉快地帮你换成薯条，因为我们对她表示了尊重。

类似于“不好意思麻烦你……”“你能帮我一个忙吗？”“可否请你……”“你是否介意”“谢谢”之类的简短客气语句能给单调乏味的生活带来一丝慰藉。当然，这也是良好家教的体现。

让我们再来看看另外一个例子。霍尔·凯恩的小说《基督徒》《法官》《马恩岛人》等都是20世纪初的畅销书，读过他的书的人不计其数。他是一个铁匠的儿子，总共只上过八年学。然而他去世时却是那个年代最富有的文学家。

他的故事是这样子的：霍尔·凯恩喜欢十四行诗和叙事诗，所以他嚼烂了但丁·加布里尔·罗赛蒂的诗歌。他甚至写过一篇赞美罗赛蒂艺术成就的散文并寄给了罗赛蒂本人。罗赛蒂很高兴，他可能心里暗想：“任何对我的能力有如此高评价的年轻人一定都是才华横溢的。”因此罗赛蒂邀请这位铁匠的儿子到伦敦给他当秘书。这是霍尔·卡恩人生中的转折点，因为通过这份工作，他遇到了诸多那个年代最优秀的文学艺术家。他从那些人的建议中得到启发，受到鼓励，终于开启了自己的写作生涯，他的大名也得以载入史册。

他在马恩岛的家——格里巴城堡也成了全世界游客向往的旅游胜地，还留下了价值几百万美金的房产。如果他没有写过那篇赞美名人的散文，他或许会在贫穷和默默无闻中死去。

这就是真诚赞美的惊人力量。

罗赛蒂认为自己很重要，这一点都不奇怪。几乎每个人都觉得自己非常重要，无可替代。

很多人的生活轨迹都可能会改变，前提是如果有人让他们感觉到自己的重要性。罗纳德·J．罗兰是我们加州培训班的一位讲师，他也是一名教艺术和手工的老师。他曾写信给我们讲过他的初级手工班里一名叫克里斯的学生的故事：

“克里斯非常安静，是一个没什么自信的害羞男孩，就是那种总是得不到应有关注的学生。我还教一个高级班，能为自己赢得那堂课一个席位的学生便拥有了荣誉和某种身份象征。

“那是某个周三，克里斯在他的课桌前用功地制作着工艺品。我真的觉得这孩子心里仿佛有一团隐形的火，因此我问克里斯是否愿意加入我的高级班。我真希望我能描绘出他听到这话时的表情，这个十四岁的腼腆男孩努力地克制住泪水。

“‘谁？我吗，罗兰先生？我够好吗？’

“‘是的，克里斯，你足够好。’

“那一刻我必须离开，因为我的眼泪就要涌出来了。那天克里斯走出课堂时仿佛长高了两英寸。他用明亮的蓝眼睛望着我，声音激动地说：‘罗兰先生，谢谢你。’

“克里斯让我学到了一堂终生难忘的课程——我们对重要感的深深渴望。为了时刻记得这一道理，我制作了一个牌子，上面写着‘你很重要’并把它挂在了教室最前方。我希望每个学生都能看到，也希望这能提醒我，每个学生都是同样重要。”

显而易见的真相就是：你遇到的每个人都认为自己在某个方面比你强，而走进他们心里的方法便是让他们意识到你真诚地承认他们的重要性。

别忘了爱默生的话：“我遇到的每个人在某些方面都比我强，都是我的导师。”

可悲的是，那些最不配拥有成就感的人却上演着喧闹、欺瞒的戏码，助长着令人作呕的自负。就如莎士比亚所说：“……人类，自负的人类，穿着那一丁点的权威，在天堂面前玩着荒诞的把戏，使天使落下眼泪。”

你知道我们培训班中的商务人士是如何对这些法则应用于现实生活并得到显著成效的吗？让我来告诉你吧。就举康涅狄格州的一名律师的例子吧（由于对亲戚的顾虑，他希望不公布自己的名字）。

加入课程不久后，R先生和妻子开车到长岛拜访妻子的亲戚。妻子中途离席去和年轻的亲戚攀谈，留下R先生和她的一位年长的姨妈在一起聊天。他想到自己不久将要在班里做关于感激的实际应用的演讲，便觉得或许能从和老姨妈的聊天中得到一些有用的内容。所以他环顾四周，想找找有什么可以真诚欣赏的东西。

“这房子是1890年盖起来的，对吧？”他问道。

“没错，”她回答，“就是1890年。”

“这让我想到了我出生的那个房子。”他说，“这房子真漂亮。建得又坚固又温馨。你知道的，现在的人建不出这样的房子了。”

“说得没错。”老阿姨表示赞同。“现在的年轻人不在乎房子好不好看。他们只想要一个小公寓，然后坐在车里四处游荡。”

“这是个梦想之家。”她的声音因充满温柔的回忆而微微颤抖，“这是用爱建起的房子。我丈夫和我在建它之前憧憬了好几年，我们没有建筑师，一切都是我们自己设计的。”

她领R先生参观了房子，而他对老阿姨在旅行时收集到并珍惜了一生的小物件表示衷心的欣赏——佩斯利披肩、一套古老的英国茶具、韦奇伍德瓷器、法国的床和椅子、意大利的画还有曾经挂在法国城堡里的丝绸帷幔。

向R先生展示过房子后，老姨妈带他去看了停车库。在石阶上停着一辆崭新的帕卡德。

她轻声说：“这是我先生去世前不久给我买的，他死后我就再也没有开过。你懂得欣赏美好的事物，我要把这辆车送给你。”

“哦，阿姨，这怎么行？”他说道，“这太贵重了。当然我很感激您的慷慨，但是我不能接受。我甚至连您的亲戚都不是。我已经有一辆新车了，我相信您有很多亲戚会想要这辆帕卡德的。”

“亲戚！”她大叫道，“是啊，我是有亲戚，他们都等着我死，然后就能把那辆车开走了。但是我不会让他们得到这辆车的。”

“如果您不想送给亲戚也可以卖给二手车商。”他告诉她。

“卖掉它！”她喊道，“你觉得我会卖掉它吗？你觉得我能忍受陌生人开着这辆车在街上穿梭吗？那可是我丈夫买给我的车！我想都没想过要卖掉它。我要把它送给你，你会欣赏美好的东西。”

R先生想尽办法拒绝，但无法不伤害她的感情地达到目标。

这位女士，孤单地和她的佩斯利披肩、法国古董以及她的回忆住在这间大房子里，渴望得到的只是一丝丝的重视。她也曾经年轻貌美、颇受欢迎。她曾经用爱建筑了温馨的房子，并从欧洲收集了各种物件来打扮房子。而现在，到了孤苦伶仃的年龄，她渴望那一丝来自他人的温暖和一点真诚的欣赏，但没有人能给她。当她得到了温暖和欣赏时就像在沙漠中找到了绿洲，她想不到什么能表达她的感激之情了，所以她把珍贵的帕卡德赠予了R先生。

让我们来看另一个例子。唐纳德·M．麦克马洪是路易斯瓦伦丁的主管，纽约莱伊市的苗圃和园林建筑师。他讲到了这样一件事：

“我参加‘如何赢得朋友、影响他人’的培训班后不久，开始为一位知名法官的庄园设计园艺。庄园主给我列出了几条关于在什么地方种大片杜鹃花的指示。

“我对他说：‘法官，您的爱好真不赖。我特别喜欢您那几只狗，我知道您每年都在麦迪逊广场公园那边赢很多的蓝绶带。’

“我流露出的仰慕带来了惊人的效果。

“‘没错。’法官回答，‘我是很喜欢养狗。你想不想看看我的养狗场？’

“他用了差不多一个小时给我展示他的狗和他得过的荣誉。他甚至还拿出了这些狗的血统记录，给我解释了优良血统是如何使他的狗拥有出色的外貌和智力的。

“最后，他转身问我：‘你有小孩吗？’

“‘有的。我有个儿子。’我回答道。

“‘那他想不想养只小狗？’法官问道。

“‘哦，他很想。他会高兴坏了的。’

“‘好吧，我送给他一只。’法官宣布。

“然后他开始给我讲解如何养狗。过了一会儿他停了下来，说他怕这样告诉我我会忘记的，他决定写下来。于是这位法官回到屋里，打出了小狗的血统和喂养说明，并送给我一只价值几百美金的小狗。他从他宝贵的时间里为我抽出了一个小时十五分钟，只因我对他的爱好和成就表示了真诚的仰慕。”

柯达的创始人乔治·伊斯曼发明了促使电影胶片诞生的幻灯片，不仅挣了上亿美金，自己也成为世上最出名的商人之一。然而即便有这诸多的成就，他依然和你我一样渴望被认可。

比如说，当他在罗切斯特创建了伊斯曼音乐学院并盖起了库伯恩音乐厅时，纽约高档座椅公司的总裁詹姆斯·亚当森希望为音乐厅提供座椅。于是亚当森先生致电建筑师，并预约时间与伊斯曼先生在罗切斯特会面。

亚当森抵达后，建筑师说：“我知道你很想拿到这笔订单，但是我现在就可以向你保证，如果你占用了伊斯曼先生超过五分钟的时间，就一丁点希望都没有了。他是个厉行纪律的大忙人。所以请你尽快说明意图，尽快离开。”

亚当森事先正是准备这样做的。

当他被带入房间时，他看到伊斯曼先生正埋在桌上的一堆文件中。这时伊斯曼先生抬头摘掉了眼镜，走向建筑师和亚当森先生，并说：“早上好，先生们。有什么我可以效劳的？”

建筑师介绍了双方，然后亚当森说：“伊斯曼先生，在等您的时候，我一直在欣赏您的办公室，我真想自己也能在这样的房间里办公。我从事室内装修行业，但这辈子从没见过这么漂亮的办公室。”

乔治·伊斯曼回答：“你提醒了我几乎已经忘掉的事。它真的很美，不是吗？刚建起来的时候，我自己也是特别享受在这里工作的。不过现在每天脑子里都有太多的事，有时一连几周都不会注意到这房间本身。”

亚当森走过去，摸着一块板子说：“这是英国橡木吧？和意大利橡木有些不同。”

“没错。”伊斯曼回答，“这是进口的英国橡木。这是一个木材行家朋友帮我挑选的。”

然后伊斯曼向他展示了整个房间，讲解着比例、颜色、雕刻和其他他参与设计并执行的方方面面。

在参观房间、赞美木工活时，伊斯曼在窗前停住了，他用他那谦虚、温和的讲话方式介绍了他出资赞助从而能帮助更多人的机构：罗切斯特大学、综合医院、顺势疗法医院、友好家园、儿童医院。亚当森对伊斯曼用财富缓解人类痛苦的人道主义举动表示了衷心的敬仰。然后，伊斯曼打开了玻璃柜的锁，拿出了他拥有的第一台相机——那是他从一个英国人那里买来的。

亚当森详细地了解了伊斯曼先生创业初期的艰辛处境，而伊斯曼先生的话语中透露出对儿时贫苦生活的切实感受，也讲了他在保险公司工作时，他的母亲是如何照看一家寄宿舍的。对贫穷的恐惧日夜萦绕着他，使他下定决心赚足够的钱，让母亲不必工作。当伊斯曼先生讲到他的经历和照相干版的实验时，亚当森又不停询问并倾听着，听得入了迷。伊斯曼讲了他是如何在办公室里没日没夜地工作，连续七十二小时只有在等待照片成像时才能和衣小睡一会儿的。

十点十五分时，亚当森被带入伊斯曼的办公室，虽然之前已经被提醒了不能占用伊斯曼先生超过五分钟的时间，然而一个小时过去了，两个小时也过去了，他们还在聊。

最后乔治·伊斯曼转向亚当森说：“上次我去日本时买了些椅子带回家，然后放在了阳台上，但是阳光把它们晒掉漆了，所以前几天我到城里买了些油漆，自己重漆了这些椅子。你想不想看看我的手艺？如果可以的话，到我家和我一起吃午饭，让我展示给你看。”

午饭后，伊斯曼先生向亚当森展示了他从日本买来的椅子。这些椅子不过几百美金，但亿万富翁乔治·伊斯曼却视之如珍宝，因为那是他自己刷的漆。

椅子的订单合同金额总共九万美金。你认为是谁得到了这个订单？亚当森还是他的竞争对手？答案不言而喻。

从那时起直到伊斯曼去世，亚当森和他都保持着亲密的朋友关系。

法国鲁昂的餐馆老板克劳德·马拉依运用了这个法则，并留下了餐馆一名重要的员工。这位女士为马拉依工作了五年，是马拉依和21位员工之间的纽带。接到她寄来的辞职挂号信时，马拉依不由得大吃一惊。

马拉依说：“我非常吃惊，更是失望，因为我一直以为我对她很好，满足了她的需求。作为朋友和老板，或许对于她的努力，我接受得过于理所当然了，抑或对她的要求也比对其他员工高。

“当然我不会在没有听到任何解释的情况下接受她的辞职。我把她拉到一边，说：‘波莱，你必须知道我无法接受你的辞职。你对我和公司来说太重要了，对于公司的成功来说，你和我都是一样重要的。’我在所有员工面前又重复了这话，并邀请她到我家来，在家人面前重申了我对她的信心。

“之后波莱撤回了辞职请求，如今我更加信任她了。我常常表示对她努力工作的感谢，并告诉她对我和我的餐馆来说，她是多么的重要。”




大英帝国最精明的统治者之一迪斯雷利说过：“和别人谈他们的事，他们能听上好几个钟头。”所以，请记住：

发自真心地，让对方感觉到自己的重要性。





第十一章　“做到便拥有世界；做不到则形单影只”


夏天里，我常常北上去缅因州钓鱼。我很喜欢草莓和奶油，但我发现鱼儿很奇怪，它们喜欢吃蚯蚓。所以我钓鱼时不会想自己喜欢吃什么，而会想鱼儿喜欢吃什么。我不会在鱼钩上挂草莓和奶油，而是把蚯蚓或蚱蜢送到鱼儿眼前，问它们：“不想吃点吗？”

如果你试图吸引其他人，为何不这样尝试呢？

第一次世界大战时期的英国首相劳合·乔治就是这样做的。有人问他，其他战争时期领袖——威尔逊、奥兰多和克莱蒙梭，都已被人遗忘，而他是怎么做到一直掌权的？他回答，如果只能归功于一点，那就是他懂得用合适的鱼饵去钓鱼的重要性。

为什么要讨论自己的需求呢？这听起来似乎很幼稚、荒唐。当然，你对自己的需求感兴趣，能永远感兴趣，但再没有其他人对你感兴趣了。其他人都像你一样，也只对自己的需求感兴趣。

所以，这世上能对他人产生影响的方式只有一种，那就是谈论对方的需求并尽可能去满足那个需求。

因此，日后当你想让他人做某事时请记住这点。例如，如果你不希望你的孩子抽烟，那么请不要只是说教，不要讲你想要什么，而要让他们明白，抽烟有可能摧毁他们加入篮球队或夺得百米跑冠军的梦想。

不论你面对的是孩子、小牛还是大猩猩，都应该记住这一点。举个例子，有一天，拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生和他儿子试图把一头牛赶回牛棚里，但他们犯了用个人需求方式思考的错误。爱默生在后面推，儿子在前面拉。然而小牛和他们做着同样的事——只考虑自己的需求，所以它绷紧四肢，拒绝离开牧草地。一个爱尔兰女佣看到了他们的窘迫情形。她虽然不会写文章、写书，但应付这种情况她还是更有办法的。她想到了小牛的需求，所以她把她那充满母性的手指放入了小牛的口中，一边让小牛吸吮着，一边慢慢把它带入牛棚。

你从出生以来所做的每件事都源于你自己的需求。那么为红十字会捐款时呢？是的，这也不例外。你捐款是因为你想要伸出援助之手，想做一件美好、无私、神圣的事。“这些事，你既是为我最不起眼的兄弟做了，便是为我做了。”(1)

若不是你想奉献的感觉强于想留住钱的感觉，便不会做出捐款之举。当然，捐款还有可能是因为不好意思不捐，或者有人要求你这样做。但有一件事是肯定的，你捐款是因为你有此需求。

哈里·A．奥沃思特利特在他那颇能给人启迪的《人类行为》一书中说：“行为源于最基本的需求……不论是对商界、学校还是政界的未来领袖来说，首要铭记于心的便是：使他人产生迫切的需求。能做到这点的人便拥有了整个世界，做不到的人便形单影只。”

出身贫寒的安德鲁·卡内基曾经做着一小时两分钱的工作，但后来他仅仅捐款就捐了3.65亿美金。他早早就懂得了影响他人的唯一方法便是基于对方需求的道理。虽然他只上过四年学，而他懂得如何与人相处。

比如，他的嫂子为她两个儿子操碎了心。他们都在耶鲁大学念书，忙得不可开交时总是不记得写信回家，也总是对母亲发疯般的来信置之不理。

后来卡内基说他有办法不要求他们回信就收到他们的回复，并愿打一百元的赌。有人愿意和他赌，于是他写了封很长的信给那两个孩子，说了很多杂七杂八的事，最后还随意补充了一句，他随信给每人寄去五美金。

不过，他“忘记”把钱放进去了。

回信很快收到了，他们感谢了“亲爱的安德鲁叔叔”，而接下来发生的事情你应该可以猜到了。

另一个例子是俄亥俄州克利夫兰的斯坦·诺瓦克，他是我们培训课里的一名学员。斯坦一天晚上下班回家看见他的小儿子提姆在客厅里乱踢乱叫。提姆第二天就要开始上幼儿园了，因此在表示强烈的抗议。换作平时，斯坦肯定会把儿子赶回自己的小屋，让他最好听话乖乖上幼儿园，即使他不愿意也得去。然而那天晚上斯坦知道这种做法无益于提姆以最佳心态开始幼儿园生活，于是他坐下来思考：“如果我是提姆，我要怎样才会为上幼儿园而感到兴奋？”他和妻子列出一系列提姆会喜欢的有趣的事，比如用手指画画、唱歌、结交新朋友，然后他们开始行动。“我们一同开始在餐桌上用手指画画——我的妻子莉尔、我的另一个儿子鲍勃还有我。很快提姆就开始从角落里偷看了，然后他也准备加入进来。‘哦，不行！你必须去幼儿园学习手指作画才能跟我们一起玩。’我对他说。于是我声情并茂地、尽可能用提姆听得懂的语言讲了那一系列幼儿园里能做的趣事。第二天早晨，我以为我是第一个起床的。谁知我下楼看到提姆在客厅的椅子上睡得正香。‘你在这儿干吗呢？’我问道。他说：‘我在等着去幼儿园。我不想迟到。’全家人对游戏的热情激起了提姆对幼儿园的渴望，而任何谈话或威胁都做不到这点。”

某一天你或许需要说服他人做某事。当你开口前请停下来先问一下自己：“我如何能让他想做此事？”

思考这个问题能避免我们一不小心掉入对自己的需求滔滔不绝，结果却适得其反的情形中。

有一段时间，我每个季度都会租下纽约某大酒店的大宴会厅二十个晚上，用来做一系列讲座。

在某一个季度的开始，我忽然被告知我要付之前三倍的租金。听到这消息时，我的门票都已经开卖了，各种活动信息也已经发布了。

当然，我不愿付多倍的钱，但跟酒店说我的需求又有什么用呢？他们只对自己的需求感兴趣。所以，几天后我去见了他们的经理。

我对他说：“我接到信后着实吃了一惊，但是我不怪你。如果我是你，估计也会做同样的事。你作为酒店经理就是要为酒店挣钱，如果你不这样做就会被开除。现在让我们先来列一下涨价带来的好处和坏处，如果列完你还是执意涨价的话，那请便。”

然后我拿出一张信纸，在中间划了一道竖线，一边写着“优势”，一边写着“劣势”。

在优势下面，我写了：“腾出宴会厅”。我继续说道：“这样你的宴会厅就可以继续出租给跳舞和开会的人们了，这是很大的优势，因为那样的场合比讲座能给你们带来更大的收益。如果这二十个晚上宴会厅都被占，你可能会与一些很赚钱的活动失之交臂。

“现在我们来想想不利的一面。首先，来自我的收益会降低而不是提高。说实话，你将彻底失去这笔收益因为我无法支付你索要的价钱，而且我将被迫更改演讲地址。

“还有另外一个不利因素。这些演讲会吸引大量有文化、高学历的人士来到你的酒店，而这对你们来讲是好的宣传，不是吗？实际上，即便你花五千美金在报纸上打广告也没法吸引这么多人来多看你们酒店一眼，而现在我把他们带上了门。这对于酒店来讲也是很重要的，不是吗？”

我边讲便把这两点写在了劣势一栏下，并把这张纸递给了经理。“我希望你能仔细思考优劣势，以及它们对你意味着什么，然后给我一个最终答复。”

第二天我收到了一封信，通知我租金只会涨50％而非300％。

别忘了，我没有说一丁点自己的需求就得到了这个优惠。从头到尾我都是只在说对方需要什么、怎么达成。

假设我做了最自然、最符合一般常理的事——怒气冲冲地闯入他的办公室，说：“你都知道我已经开始卖门票、做宣传了，现在跟我说房租涨三倍是什么意思？三倍！你疯了吗？太荒唐了！我不可能付给你！”

那样又会发生什么呢？我们会开始争论，争论会白热化，最后不用想都知道争论的结局是怎样的。即便我可以证明他错了，他为了面子也不会服输、不会让步。

下面是关于人际关系最好的建议。亨利·福特曾说过：“如果成功只有一个秘诀，那就是理解对方的观点、站在对方的角度看问题的能力。”

这话说得太好了，让我再重复一遍：“如果成功只有一个秘诀，那就是理解对方的观点，站在对方的角度看问题的能力。”

这一句话太简单、太明显了，每个人一眼就能看出这是真理，然而地球上的人在90％的情形中都会把它忘记。

如果你留心查看明天早晨收到的信，你会发现大多数人都违背了这条重要的常识。看看下面这个例子，这是一个分公司遍布全球的广告公司广播部负责人写的信。（在每段后的中括号里都写了我看后的反应。）

约翰·某某先生

某某镇

印第安纳




亲爱的某某先生：

××公司希望在广播界继续保持广告公司的领军地位。

［谁在乎你们公司希望如何？我在担心我自己的问题。银行要取消我的房屋抵押贷款；虫子毁了我的蜀葵；股市昨天跌了；我错过了早晨8：15的车；昨晚琼斯家的舞会没有邀请我；医生说我有高血压、神经炎和头皮屑。然后呢？我心事重重地来到公司，拆开信，就看到一个纽约的傲慢家伙哇啦哇啦地开始讲他的公司想要什么。呸！如果他能意识到自己的信带给别人怎样的印象，他就应该撤出广告界，去生产羊羔清洗液！］

本公司全国广告业的客户是广播网的保障。我们所打折出售的电台时间也使我们年复一年保持在业界的领先地位。

［你们又大、又富裕、又领先，是不是啊？那又如何？你就算是有通用汽车、通用电气、美国陆军总参谋部加起来那么大，我也丝毫不会关心。如果你有蜂鸟一半的智商也会意识到我只关心我自己有多重要，而不是你多重要。你对巨大成功的吹嘘只会使我觉得你们渺小、不重要。］

我们希望为广播电台信息做主，从而更好地服务于我们的客户。

［你们希望！你们希望……你们这些十足的混蛋。我对你们的希望和美国总统的希望都丝毫不感兴趣。让我最后再告诉你一遍：我只对我自己希望如何感兴趣，而你这封愚蠢的信里对此丝毫没有提及。］

因此，你们是否可以把××公司加入每周电台信息的优先列表中，即每个对智能化购买广播时间有用的细节里。

［“推荐列表。”真是厚颜无耻啊！你的夸夸其谈已然让我感觉微不足道，现在居然还要我把你加到我的“优先”列表上，而你连个请字都没说过。］

及时确认收到此信并告知你们的最新动态，将会使双方都能受益。

［白痴！你寄了一封丝毫不讲究的信，就像秋天的树叶一样随意，而你竟然有胆量让我在担心我的抵押贷款、蜀葵和血压时给你回信，并确认收到你的信，还要“及时”。什么叫“及时”？你难道不知道我和你一样忙吗？至少我是这样认为的。还有，在我们的沟通过程中，是谁给了你命令我的权利？……你说“将会使双方都能受益”。终于，你终于开始为我考虑了，但是你没有说清楚我会如何受益。］

你最真诚的，

约翰·某某某

广播部门经理

又及，随信附上从《某某镇日报》中复制的文章，你们会感兴趣的，或许可以在电台中播出。

［终于，在最后的“又及”中你提到了有可能帮助我解决问题的内容。为什么不在一开始就说呢？不过已经于事无补了。任何能说出这番胡话的广告人脑子都有问题。你不需要我们回信告诉你最新动态，你需要的是吞下一瓶碘酒治治甲状腺。］




如果身为广告人，一生致力于宣传并号称是影响力艺术的专家的人，写出的竟然是这样一封信，那么屠夫、烘焙师或是汽车修理工又会做出什么呢？

下面还有一封信，是一个大客运站负责人写给我们培训班中一位学员的，这位学员名叫爱德华·费米伦。对于这封信他会做何感想？读完我会告诉你。

请爱德华·费米伦先生阅读




先生，您好：

由于大量货物都在下午抵达我们的火车出站点收货站，我们的运营将会受阻。这种状况也会造成工作程序不畅、公司员工加班、卡车延误以及偶尔的货物运输延迟。11月10日，贵公司的510件货物于下午4：20抵达我们的收货站。

我们希望得到贵公司的支持，与我们一同解决因货物晚到而带来的不良影响。我们可否恳请贵公司在运输与11月10日等量的货物时能够让卡车提前到达收货站或使部分货物在早晨抵达？

对贵公司而言，这样做卡车便能更顺利地卸货，也能确保您的货物在当天运出。

您最真诚的，

J_____　B_____，负责人

泽瑞嘉公司的销售经理费米伦先生读完这封信后把它转寄给我，并附上了下面这段评论：

这封信起到了相反的作用。它一开始描述了收货站面对的困境，而我们总的来说是不感兴趣的。然后又请我们合作，根本不考虑可能给我们带来的不便。最后他们才说这样做给我们带来的好处是更快速地卸货和当天运出的保证。

换言之，我们最关心的事反而放在最后说，这封信总的来说令我们反感，不会有合作的欲望。

我们试着来重写一下这封信。记住，不要浪费任何笔墨讨论谈自己的问题。就如亨利·福特所说，让我们去“了解对方的观点，站在对方的角度看问题”。

下面是重写此信的一种方式。这或许不是最好的方式，但谁能说没有进步呢？

亲爱的费米伦先生，

十四年来，贵公司一直是我们的重要客户。我们很感激您的一贯支持，愿竭力为您提供您所应得的快速、高效的服务。但遗憾的是，如果贵公司的卡车像11月10日那天一样在傍晚才送到大批货物，我们将无法保证货物的及时运输。为什么呢？因为很多客户都在傍晚送货，这就造成了阻塞。这意味着贵公司的卡车将不可避免地需要排队卸货，有时还会导致货物的延迟输出。

这很糟糕，但可以避免。如果贵公司尽可能在早上送货，卡车将能够随时卸货，货物也将在第一时间被处理。这样，我们的员工也能按时下班，就可以在晚餐时间享用贵公司生产的美味通心粉和面条了。

当然，不论您的货物何时运到，我们都会愉快、竭诚地为您提供快捷服务。

您很忙碌。请不必回信。

你最真诚的，

J_____　B_____，负责人

在纽约一家银行工作的芭芭拉·安德逊因为儿子的健康原因想搬到亚利桑那州的凤凰城居住。她用在培训班中学到的准则给凤凰城的十二家银行写了如下一封信：

亲爱的先生，

相信飞速发展的贵银行对我十年的银行工作经验会有兴趣。

在信孚银行工作的这段时间里，我熟识了银行每日运营的全部过程，包括维护储蓄客户关系、信托、贷款和行政管理，后来成了分行经理。

我将在5月份迁至凤凰城，请相信我会为贵银行带来发展与效益。4月3日那周我会在凤凰城，如果您能给我一个展示如何为贵银行达成目标的机会，我将感激不尽。

真诚的，

芭芭拉·L．·安德逊

你觉得芭芭拉会得到银行的回复吗？结果是这十二家银行中的十一家邀请她参加面试，她得选择最终接受哪家银行的录用邀请。为什么呢？安德逊夫人没有说自己想要什么，在信中写的是她能带给对方什么，把重点放在了对方的需求上，而非自己的。

今天，有无数薪水微薄的销售人员疲惫、气馁地捶着地。为什么？因为他们总是想着自己要什么，他们没有意识到你和我根本不想买东西。如果想买，我们自然会出门买。然而你和我都永远对解决自己的问题最感兴趣。所以，如果销售人员能够展示给我们他们的服务或产品能怎样解决我们的问题，那么连推销都是不必要的了，我们自然会买。此外，顾客喜欢感觉自己是在购买，而非被兜售。

然而很多销售人员一辈子都不懂从顾客的角度看问题。比如，我曾在森林山住了很多年，那是大纽约中部的一个私宅小社区。有一天，我在去车站的路上碰到一个房地产经纪人。他在森林山社区从事房屋买卖多年，很了解那里的情况，所以我匆忙地向他询问我那水泥墙房是金属板条还是空心砖建造的。他说他不知道，并告诉了我我本就知道的信息，他建议我打电话给森林山园协会询问。第二天早晨我收到了他的来信，但他提供了我所需的信息了吗？原本他花六十秒钟打个电话就可以找出问题的答案，然而他没有。他再次告诉我可以打电话询问，然后让我买他家的保险。

他根本不想帮助我。他只对帮助自己感兴趣。

亚拉巴马州伯明翰的J．霍华德·卢卡斯给我讲了同家公司的两个销售人员是如何处理类似的情形的：

“几年前，我只是一家小公司管理团队中的一员。我们公司的旁边是一家大保险公司的区域总部办公室。他们公司的保险代理人各自负责不同的区域，而且我们公司正好是这两名保险代理员负责的。在这里就称他们为卡尔和约翰吧。

“一个早晨，卡尔到我们的办公室来，不经意间提到了一种新的高管人寿保险，他认为我们可能会感兴趣。他说一旦他有更多信息就会告诉我们。

“也是在同一天，约翰在路上看到我们买咖啡回来，于是喊住了我们：‘嘿，卢克，等一等。我有好消息告诉你们。’他兴奋地跑过来说他们公司当天推出了一种新的高管人寿保险（就是卡尔提到的那个），他希望我们能成为最早的签约人。他还告诉我们几个重要的保险项目，最后说：‘这个保险政策刚刚推出，我会让总部的人明天过来跟你们解释细节，但现在，我们先把申请表填好吧，这样总部的人到了以后就可以开始处理了。’他的热情激起了我们对这份保险的渴望，即便我们还不清楚其中的细节。总部的人过来后肯定了约翰最初的理解，他不仅仅卖给了我们一人一份保险，还帮我们把保险项目加了倍。

“卡尔本可以卖给我们这份保险的，但他并没有努力使我们产生兴趣。”

这世界充斥着只顾自己的人，所以那些少数的无私服务于他人的人就获得了无可比拟的优势。知名律师、美国最了不起的商业领袖之一欧文·D．扬曾说过：“那些能站在他人的角度考虑问题、懂得他人思维模式的人永远不用为未来而担忧。”

如果从这本书里你只收获了一个理念——多去思考他人的观点和立场——你便已经为自己的职业生涯奠定了一块基石。

观察他人的观点、激发他人的需求并不是为了让对方做使你受益、使他自己遭殃的事，而是让双方都受益。在致费米伦的信中，收信和寄信人都能在建议的行为中受益。安德逊夫人的信也能使她本人和银行都受益——银行将得到一名得力员工，而安德逊夫人将得到一份合适的工作。在约翰卖保险给卢卡斯的例子中，双方也都得到了利益。

罗德岛沃里克的迈克尔·E．维登是另一个激发他人需求从而使双方受益的例子。迈克尔是壳牌石油公司的区域销售员，他想成为该区域的销售冠军，但有一个加油站在拖后腿。这是一个年老的人经营的加油站，他没有维护的欲望，于是这个加油站变得破旧不堪，也严重影响了业绩。

经理不愿听取迈克尔让他重修加油站的请求，不论是严声逼迫还是晓之以理动之以情都不起作用。迈克尔决定邀请这位经理参观他的管辖区里新开的一家加油站。

这位经理看后颇为震撼，当迈克尔再一次走访这个加油站时却发现加油站已被收拾一新，业绩也有显著的提高。这使迈克尔最终成了地区销售冠军。那些谈话都没用，最有效的方式是展示给那位经理看现代化加油站的样子激发出他维护加油站的需求。迈克尔达成了目标，双方都能受益。

大多数人在大学中读了维吉尔，学了微积分，却从未探索过大脑的运作方式。例如，我曾给刚加入开利公司的应届毕业生做过一堂关于演讲技巧的讲座。开利公司是一家庞大的空调制造商。公司的一位学员想说服其他人在闲暇时一起打篮球，于是说：“我要你们出来打球。我喜欢打篮球，但是之前每次我去篮球场时人数都不够。有一天晚上我们只有两三个人打球，我的眼睛都被打肿了。我希望你们明天晚上都能来，我想打篮球。”

他提及了你的需求吗？没有。你不想去没人去的球场打球，不是吗？是的。你不在乎他想干什么，你不想被打肿眼。

他是否可以给你展示去球场的好处？当然。打球不仅能增加活力、增强食欲，而且使大脑更清晰、使人更愉悦。毕竟篮球比赛是有趣的事。

让我们牢牢记住奥沃思特利特教授的金玉良言：首先，要“使他人产生迫切的需求。能做到这点的人便拥有了整个世界，做不到的人便形单影只”。

训练班上的一个学员很担心自己的小儿子，他体重偏轻还不好好吃饭。他们连骂带哄地对儿子说：“妈妈想让你吃这个吃那个。”“爸爸想让你茁壮成长。”

那个男孩在乎这些诉求吗？他的在乎程度与你到海滩后对某粒沙子的在乎程度是一样的。

任何有常识的人都不会期待小孩能理解年长三十岁的父亲所持有的观点，然而那位父亲却是如此期待的。这很荒谬。后来他终于看到了这点，对自己说：“孩子想要什么呢？我如何才能为在我们二人的需求中架起桥梁呢？”

那位父亲开始思考后就发现这是个简单的问题。他儿子喜欢在布鲁克林家门口的街道上骑小三轮车，然而这一条街上还住着个小霸王——一个大一点的孩子，小霸王会把儿子推下车，然后自己把车骑走。

小男孩自然大哭着跑向妈妈，而妈妈就会出门从小霸王那儿把车要回来，再把儿子放上去。这样的事几乎每天都会发生。

小男孩想要什么？不用请来福尔摩斯也能回答这个问题。他的自尊、他的愤怒、他想感觉到自己很重要——这些最强烈的情绪驱使着他，使他想要报仇、彻底击败那个小霸王。后来爸爸告诉他，如果他听妈妈的话好好吃饭，那么用不了多久他就能把小霸王打得满地找牙了。听了这话后，小男孩吃饭再也不吵不闹了。菠菜、酸菜、咸鱼他都乖乖地吃，只要能让他长强壮，能战胜一直羞辱他的小霸王。

这一个问题解决后，这对父母又试图解决另一个问题了：儿子还有尿床的坏习惯。

他和奶奶一起睡。每天早晨奶奶醒来后总会感觉床单湿乎乎的，然后说：“小宝贝儿，你看你又尿床了！”

而他会说：“不，我没有！是你尿的！”

打骂、羞辱、重申爸妈希望他如何如何都没用，这些都没能挽救床单被尿湿的命运。所以父母开始思考：“我们如何能让小孩自己不想尿床？”

他的需求是什么？首先，他想要穿爸爸穿的那种睡衣裤，而不是奶奶穿的那种睡袍。奶奶受够了他的尿床行为，如果他能改邪归正，当然很愿意为他买套睡衣。其次，他想要自己睡。当然这一条遭到了奶奶的反对。

妈妈带儿子来到了布鲁克林的一家百货商店里，她对售货员眨了眨眼，说：“这位小绅士想要买点东西。”

售货员表现得对孩子很重视，问道：“小朋友，你想看点什么呀？”

他挺直身体踮起脚尖让自己高了好几英寸，说：“我想要买一张自己睡觉的床。”

母亲对售货员展示的一张床很满意，于是对她眨眼示意。小男孩最终也被说服了。

第二天床就送到了家。那天晚上父亲回家时，儿子跑向门口喊道：“爸爸！爸爸！快上楼看我买的小床！”

爸爸看了一眼小床，然后遵循了施瓦布先生的教诲，“真诚地赞赏并毫不吝惜赞赏之词”。

“你不会把这张床也尿湿了吧？”爸爸问。

“哦！不会不会！我不会再尿床了！”小男孩遵守了承诺，因为这涉及他的荣誉。那可是他自己的床，他自己挑选的床。现在，他还穿上了男士睡衣裤。他想要表现得像个男子汉，而他也的确做到了。

另一位参加讲座的父亲T．T．达赤曼是一名电话工程师，他的苦恼是无法让女儿吃早餐。常用的责骂、请求、哄骗都不起作用。所以这对父母也问自己：“我们怎样做她才会自己想要吃早饭？”

小女孩喜欢模仿妈妈，她觉得这样做就像个大人了，于是一个早晨，他们把她放在椅子上，让她自己做早餐。就在爸爸转身走进厨房的一刻，正在搅麦片的小女孩说：“哦，爸爸，你看，今天早晨我在做麦片粥呢。”

不用任何哄骗，她就吃了双份的麦片，因为她感兴趣。她得到了重要感。她从做麦片粥这件事中找到了一种自我表达的途径。

威廉·温特曾说过：“自我表达是人性中关键的需求。”为什么我们不能在商务往来中运用这种心理呢？当我们想到了一个好主意时，与其让别人认为这是我们的主意，倒不如在他人心中播下火种，让他们自己燃起这个想法呢。他们会把它当成自己的主意；他们会更喜欢这个主意，并为之加倍付出。

请记住这一首要建议：“使他人产生迫切的需求。能做到这点的人便拥有了整个世界，做不到的人便形单影只。”




使他人产生迫切的需求。

第十二章　“如果你想采蜜，不要踢翻蜂巢”


1931年5月7日，纽约市最轰动的一起追捕行动进入了白热化阶段。经过了几周的搜查后，杀人犯“双枪”克劳利终于走投无路，这个烟酒不沾的持枪歹徒被围困在他女友的西区公寓中。

一百五十名警察和侦探包围了顶层他的藏身处，他们在房檐上钻孔，试图用烟雾弹把这个警察杀手呛出来，他们还在周围的高楼上架设了机关枪。整整一个多小时内，这个纽约高档住宅区里回荡的都是手枪和机关枪发射子弹的声音。克劳利躲在堆得密密实实的椅子后面不停向警察开枪。一万多名兴奋的群众在观战，这样的场景从未在纽约市的街道上发生过。

克劳利被捕后，E．P．莫鲁尼警长宣布这个双枪亡命徒是纽约有史以来最危险的罪犯之一。警长说：“他可以为任何不起眼的事而杀人。”

但“双枪”克劳利是怎么看自己的呢？从他的信中我们可以窥探一二，就在警察向公寓开枪时，他写下了一封“致有关人士”的信。他用伤口涌出的血在信纸上留下一道殷红的印记，他在信中写道：“在我的外表下藏着一颗疲倦却善良的心，它不会伤害任何人。”

之前不久，克劳利和他的女友在长岛的一条乡间小路上激情拥吻。这时一名警察忽然走过来说：“出示你的驾照。”

克劳利二话不说，掏出枪对着警察疯狂扫射。在警察倒下时，他跳下车，用警察的枪又往那已经倒下的身体中射入了一枚子弹。这就是那个自己宣称“我的外表下藏着一颗疲倦却善良的心，不会伤害任何人”的人。

克劳利被判了电椅处死。当他走进纽约新新监狱的处刑室后，他说了一句话。他是否说“这就是我杀人的下场”？不，他说的是：“这就是自我防卫的下场。”

故事的重点在于，“双枪”克劳利不认为自己有任何问题。

在罪犯中，这种态度罕见吗？如果你这么认为，请听听这个：

“我用我最好的年华给人们带去最多的快乐，帮助他们获得更美好的时光，而我却只落得辱骂和被追捕的下场。”

这是艾尔·卡彭的原话。没错，就是那个美国最十恶不赦的公敌，芝加哥最邪恶的黑帮头目。卡彭没有谴责自己，他甚至把自己看作公共施恩者——一个不被感激、不被理解的公众恩人。

达奇·舒尔茨在被纽瓦克黑帮枪杀前也是这样想的。他是纽约最臭名昭著的混混之一。他也曾在接受报社采访时称自己为社会行善。并且，确信事实就是如此。

我曾与纽约新新监狱的狱监路易斯·劳斯进行过为期数年的有趣对话，谈论的内容正是围绕着此话题。他说：“新新监狱里很少有罪犯觉得自己是坏人。他们和你我一样都是人，所以都会为自己开脱、会把事情解释得合理化。他们理直气壮地讲出当时为何要抢保险柜，手指为何会那么敏捷地扣动扳机。他们中大多数人会用谬误或没有逻辑性的理由为自己的反社会行为进行辩解，自己也相信了这些理由。结果就是，他们坚定地相信自己压根不该被捕入狱。”

假如像卡彭、“双枪”克劳利、舒尔茨和监狱高墙背后的罪犯这样的人都不懂得从自己身上找问题，那么你我认识的人呢？

创立了以自己名字命名的百货公司的约翰·沃纳梅克曾经坦言：“三十年前我就懂得了责骂他人这一举动的愚蠢。克服自身的局限性并不去抱怨上帝没有公平分配智商就已经很不易了。”

沃纳梅克很早就领悟到了这个道理，而我则继续在这个老套的世界里跌跌撞撞三十余年才察觉到，在99％的情况下，人们都不会从自身找问题，不论自己做了怎样荒唐的事。

批评是毫无意义的，因为它会开启对方的自我防卫心理，往往使人竭力为自己辩护。批评也是很危险的，因为它会伤害一个人宝贵的尊严和自我价值，也会引起愤恨的情绪。

全球著名心理学家B．F．斯金纳曾通过实验证明，因做出正确行为而得到奖励的动物比因做出错误行为而受罚的动物能更有效地学习。之后的研究更显示，这理论也适用于人类。人们不会因批评而做出长久的改变，还往往会心生怨恨。

另一位伟大心理学家汉斯·塞利曾说过：“我们对指责的恐惧就如对肯定的渴望一样强烈。”

批评所引发的怨恨会使员工、家人和朋友意志消沉，到头来却依然没能解决问题。

俄克拉荷马伊尼德市的乔治·B．约翰斯顿是一家工程公司的安全协调人员，他的责任之一便是要确保员工进入工地时戴好安全帽。他说，每当他看到不戴安全帽的工人时，都会用权威而专业的口吻重申法规并命令他们严格遵从。虽然工人会在他面前闷闷不乐地答应，可等他一转身工人就又把帽子摘了下来。

他决定尝试新的方法。当他再看到不戴安全帽的员工时，他会首先询问帽子是否不舒服或者不合适，然后再用令人愉悦的口吻提醒他们帽子是为保护员工不受伤害而设计的，并建议他们工作时要一直戴着安全帽。结果遵守规定的人一下子增加了很多，怨气和愤怒也消失不见了。

历史上还存在着不少这类毫无意义的批评的例子，例如总统西奥多·罗斯福和塔夫脱之间的争论。这场争论分裂了共和党，把伍德罗·威尔逊送进了白宫，在第一次世界大战中留下一条清晰的线并改变了历史的轨迹。1908年，当西奥多·罗斯福离开白宫时，他是支持新当选的总统塔夫脱的。后来罗斯福去非洲猎狮子，返回后他的情绪爆发了。他指责塔夫脱过于保守，试图确保第三次任期的提名，还组建了雄鹿党，差点就摧毁了共和党。在随后的选举中，威廉·霍华德·塔夫脱和共和党只拿下了两个州——佛蒙特州和犹他州。这是共和党世上最惨烈的一次失利。

西奥多·罗斯福谴责塔夫脱，可塔夫脱会自责吗？坦白地说，我不知道。我想表达的是，罗斯福的批评并没有令塔夫脱认识到自己有问题，而只是让塔夫脱竭力为自己辩护，含泪重申：“我不认为有其他的方式来行事。”

或者也可以拿茶壶顶石油丑闻作为例子。这件事在20年代早期引起了轩然大波，各大报纸争相报道。它震惊了全国，在人们的记忆里，美国公众生活中还没有发生过这样的事。事情是这样的：哈丁的内政部长阿尔伯特·B．福尔被授权负责麋鹿山和茶壶顶的政府石油储备，这些石油是为海军日后的需求而储备的。福尔部长实行了竞争性投标吗？没有。他把这项利润极高的工程直接交给了朋友爱德华·L．多希尼。而多希尼是怎么做的呢？他给了福尔部长十万美金，声称是贷款。福尔部长专横地命令美国海军赶走在麋鹿山开采石油的其他竞争商家。在枪口和刺刀的威逼下，这些油商离开了油田，走进了法庭，揭露了茶壶顶丑闻。这个丑闻带来了巨大的不利影响，它摧毁了哈丁政权，引起了全国的反感，也威胁到共和党的存亡，并使阿尔伯特·B．福尔锒铛入狱。

福尔受到强烈的指责——很少有公众人物经历过这种程度的指责，他悔过了吗？从来没有！几年后赫伯特·胡佛在一次公共演讲中暗示哈丁总统的死是由于心理焦虑，因为一个朋友背叛了他。当福尔夫人听到此话时从椅子上跳了起来，她哭着说：“什么？哈丁被福尔背叛了？没有！我丈夫从未背叛任何人。就算满屋黄金也不能诱惑我的丈夫做坏事。他才是那个被人出卖、被杀戮、被迫害的人。”

这就是人性最真实的写照了。犯错的人总是怪罪于其他人，唯独不怪自己。我们皆是如此。所以当你我明天想要指责他人时，要记住艾尔·卡彭、“双枪”克劳利和阿尔伯特·福尔的例子。我们要认识到，指责就像家养的鸽子，总是会飞回家的。要知道，我们要去纠正和谴责的人很可能会为自己辩护，然后反过来指责我们。或者会像塔夫脱将军那样说：“我不认为有其他的方式行事。”

1865年4月15日的早晨，在一个廉价住所一楼走廊尽头的狭小卧室中，亚伯拉罕·林肯奄奄一息地躺在床上。旅馆对面就是约翰·威尔克斯·布斯枪杀林肯的福特剧院，林肯修长的身体在软塌塌的过于短小的床上呈对角线伸展开来。床头挂着罗莎·帮贺的名画《马市》的廉价复制品，还有阴沉的煤油灯闪动着昏黄的光。

林肯躺在那里即将辞世时，陆军部长斯坦顿说：“那里躺着的是人类在世间所见过的最完美的统治者。”

林肯和人打交道的成功秘诀是什么？我用十年时间研究了林肯的一生，用了三年时间撰写又不断重写一本书——《林肯传》（Lincoln the Unknown）。对林肯的性格和家庭生活的研究，我相信没有人比我做得更详尽了。我特别钻研了林肯与人交往的方式。他是否曾经乐于指责？哦，是的。年轻时还住在印第安纳州鸽溪山谷的林肯不但指责他人，还以写信、作诗的方式嘲讽别人，而且还会把这些信件撒放在必定会被人看到的乡间小路上。其中的一封信引起了一个人燃烧一生的愤恨。

即便林肯在伊利诺伊州的斯普林菲尔德市当执业律师时，依然会在报纸上公然发表信件来攻击对手。但或许他应该有所节制。

1842年的秋天，他嘲讽了一个自负、好斗的政治家，此人名叫詹姆斯·席尔斯。林肯在斯普林菲尔德日报上发表了一封匿名讽刺信，引起了全城人哄笑。敏感而骄傲的席尔斯极度愤怒，他找出了文章的作者，跳上马背追踪到林肯的面前并向他提出决斗的挑战。林肯不愿动武，他反对决斗，但无法保全荣誉地避开决斗。林肯可以自己选择武器，因为他的手臂很长，他选了骑兵大刀，然后开始和西点军校的毕业生学习搏斗。到了指定的日期，他和席尔斯在密西西比河畔的沙堤上见面了，准备战个你死我活，但在最后一分钟里，他们的副手前来阻止了这场决斗。

这是林肯一生中最可怕而重要的一件私事，它给林肯上了一堂人际交往的课。之后他再没写过侮辱性信件，也再没有嘲讽过任何人。从那时起，他几乎再也没有因任何事而指责过任何人。

在南北战争时期，林肯一次又一次地更换波多马克的军队首领——麦克莱伦、蒲伯、伯恩赛德、胡克、米德，但他们每个人都犯了悲剧性的错误，使得林肯不停地在绝望中踱步。半个美国都在凶狠地谴责这些无能的将军，但林肯“对任何人都没有恶意，对所有人都宽容、和善”，他保持着平和。他最爱的一句名言是“不评判，则不被评判。”

当林肯夫人和其他人都在严声指责南方人时，林肯说：“别指责他们。他们只是做了我们在那种情况下也会做的事罢了。”

然而最有权指责的人莫过于林肯了。我们只需看一个例子：

在1863年7月的前三天，葛底茨堡之役开始了。7月4日的晚上，乌云卷着雨笼罩着大地，当李将军带着惨败的军队来到波多马克河时，他发现面前淌着一条宽广、无法跨越的大河，而身后是完胜的北方军。李将军掉进了陷阱里，无处可逃。林肯看到了这个天赐良机，只要俘获李将军的军队就能立刻结束战争。所以林肯带着厚望命令米德不要召集军事会议，直接围剿李军。林肯先是用电报发出了指令，而后又派遣了一名特殊信差告知米德立刻行动。

米德将军做了什么呢？他做了截然相反的事。他彻底违背了林肯的指示，召集了军事会议。他犹豫、拖延，在电报里做了各种解释，拒绝直截了当地攻击李军。最后河水退了，李军越过了波多马克河，成功地逃脱了。

林肯怒不可遏，他对儿子罗伯特大喊：“这是怎么回事？上天啊！这是怎么回事？他们就在我们的掌控之中，只需伸出手指胜利就是我们的了，然而，我怎么说怎么做都没法让军队动起来。在那种情形下，任何一个将军都能打败李军，如果我在那儿都能亲手灭了他。”

在苦楚的绝望中，林肯坐了下来，给米德写了下面这封信。要知道，在这个人生阶段里林肯用词是极端保守和有节制的，所以林肯这封1863年写的信已经堪称最严厉的谴责了。

我亲爱的将军，

我认为你不了解李军逃脱的严重后果。他本就在我们的掌控之中，结合我们之前的胜利来看，剿灭了他也就等于结束了战争。现如今，战争又要无止境地延续下去。如果上周一你不能稳稳拿下李军，那现在只带着2/3的军力，你又怎可能成功向大河以南征战？现如今期待你改变局面已不太现实，而我也不会再如此期待。你失去了天赐良机，而我因此无比悲痛。

你猜米德读完这封信是怎么做的？

事实上，米德从未收到过这封信，因为林肯并没有把信寄出去。林肯去世后，人们在他的文件堆中找到了这封信。

我猜想——这仅仅是猜想而已——林肯写完信后望向窗外，对自己说：“等等，或许我不能如此草率。我坐在白宫里发号施令总是容易的，但如果我在葛底茨堡前线，亲眼看到米德上周看到的尸山血海，听到受伤者、垂死者发出的嚎叫，或许我也会不那么急于进攻了。如果我像米德那样个性腼腆，或许会做出同样的反应。不论如何事已至此，寄出这封信我会感觉好些，但会使米德急于为自己辩解。他会指责我，会产生怨气。这会影响他作为将领今后的表现，或许还会使他被迫辞职。”

所以就如我之前所说的那样，林肯把信放在了一边。他已经通过惨痛的经历学到了：尖锐的指责到最后几乎总是无谓的。

西奥多·罗斯福说，当他面临复杂问题时总会靠在椅背上看着白宫办公桌上方悬挂的林肯的大幅画像，然后问自己：“如果林肯面临同样的情况，他会怎么做？他会怎么解决这个问题？”

下次当我们想要批评别人时，让我们掏出五美金钞票看看林肯的头像，然后问自己：“林肯会如何解决这个问题？”

马克·吐温偶尔会发火，写些令人大惊失色的信。比如有一次他写信给一个令他愤怒的人：“你需要的是一张埋葬许可证。你只需开口，我保证你拿到手。”还有一次他给一位编辑写了封信，针对的是校对者关于订正他的拼写和标点符号所做的尝试。他命令道：“从此以后不要改动我的原稿，让校对者的建议保留在他那腐蚀成一坨糨糊的大脑里。”

写完这些尖锐的信让马克·吐温感觉舒服多了，这是一种发泄，而且也没有带来不好的影响，因为马克的妻子悄悄把这些信从信箱中拿了出来，从未寄出过。

你认识那些自己希望改变、管制和改善的人吗？很好，这没有问题。我完全赞同。但是为何不从自己开始？从完全自私的角度来说，这样做比改善别人获益更多，而且也更安全。中国古语说得好：“各人自扫门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜。”

我在年轻时，也就是试图让每个人对我印象深刻的那个阶段里，曾经给理查德·哈丁·戴维斯写过一封愚蠢的信。他是当时美国文坛闪耀的一位作家，而那时我正在写一篇关于作家的杂志文章，希望戴维斯告诉我他的工作方式。几周前我从别人那儿收到一封信，底部写着“口述未核对”。这给我留下了极深的印象。我想对方肯定特别有威望，工作又忙碌。我一点也不忙，但为了让理查德·哈丁·戴维斯对我印象深刻，我在给他的那封短信下也写上了“口述未核对”。

他不做其他回复，只是把信退给了我，在底部草草写着：“你的无礼只能被你自己的无礼超越了。”没错，我是鲁莽了，或许罪有应得。但作为一个人，我很愤恨。我的这种情绪如此之强，以至于十年后当我听到了他的死讯时，第一个想到的就是他给我带来的伤害。——我羞愧地承认这点。

如果你我想引起持续几十年甚至一生的痛苦，那么就尽情地给予发泄性批判吧。

与人相处时要记得，人类不是逻辑动物。我们面对的是情绪动物，他们长着偏见的刺，被骄傲和虚荣所驱使。

哈代是英国文学史上最好的小说家之一，刻薄的批评使敏感的托马斯·哈代永远放弃了继续写小说。批评还使英国诗人托马斯·查特顿结束了自己的生命。

年轻时的本杰明·富兰克林不谙世事，后来变得非常有外交手段。他非常善于与人交往，后来成了美国驻法大使。他成功的秘密是什么？他说“我不说别人的坏话，并且只说我所知道的他们的优点。”

任何愚蠢的人都知道怎样批评、指责和抱怨别人，而大多数愚蠢人也是这样做的。

然而理解和宽容却需要人格和自制力。

卡莱尔说：“对待小人物的方式体现了伟人的伟大。”

鲍勃·胡佛是一个知名的试飞员，常常进行空中飞行表演。有一次，他完成了圣地亚哥的飞行表演正向着洛杉矶的家中返回，据《飞行操作》杂志的描述，在三百尺的空中，飞机的两个引擎忽然都失灵了，他靠熟练的操作才得以安全着陆。虽然无人受伤，但飞机受到了严重损坏。

胡佛紧急降落后做的第一件事便是检查机油。就如他所怀疑的那样，这架二战螺旋桨式飞机被灌了喷气机式燃油，而非汽油。

回到机场后他提出要见这架飞机的机械师。机械师是一个年轻人，他为自己的错误深感痛苦。当胡佛走近时，这个年轻人的眼泪马上涌了出来。他刚刚导致一架昂贵的飞机报废，还差点连累三个人丧命。

你能想象到胡佛有多生气，也能猜想到这位骄傲、严谨的飞行员将如何大骂机械师的疏忽。然而胡佛没有骂他，甚至没有批评他。相反，他用他结实的手臂搭着对方的肩膀说：“我相信你以后再也不会犯这样的错误。为了证明这点，我想让你明天维护我的F-51。”

家长总是爱批评孩子。你可能以为我会建议“不要这样”，但我想表达的不是这个。我只想说：“在批评他们之前，请阅读美国报纸杂志中的一篇经典——《爸爸忘了》。”这篇文章最初被刊登在《人类之家》杂志上，我们得到了作者的授权，在此刊登经《读者文摘》浓缩后的版本。

《爸爸忘了》是那种在瞬间的诚恳感受的启发下而写成的小文章，颇能触动读者的心弦，因极受欢迎所以被重刊多年。如作家W．利文斯顿·拉内德所述，这篇文章被“千百本杂志、企业商报和全国报纸刊印，也曾被翻译成多种文字出版。我个人就曾授权上千人在学校、教堂和讲台上宣读这篇文章。它也曾上过电台的各种场合和节目。出乎意料的是，大学期刊和高中杂志也都用过这篇文章。有时一篇小文章能神奇地触动人心。这篇就做到了。”

爸爸忘了

W．利文斯顿·拉内德

儿子，听我说：当我说这些话时，你正酣然入梦，一只小手蜷在脸颊下，金黄色的鬈发黏在湿乎乎的额头上。我一个人悄悄地走进了你的房间。几分钟前，我坐在书房看报纸，一阵令人窒息的懊恼向我袭来。我愧疚地来到了你的床前。

儿子，我在想这些事：我曾对你发脾气。在你梳洗准备上学时，我因你只用毛巾乱抹了下脸应付了事而责骂你；我因你没有擦鞋而批评你；当你把自己的东西丢在地上时，我生气地大喊大叫。

早餐时我也挑你的错。你会把食物撒出来；你狼吞虎咽；你把胳膊肘搭在桌上；你面包上抹的黄油太厚了。在你准备去玩而我准备赶火车时，你转身对我挥挥手，叫道：“爸爸再见！”我皱皱眉头回答：“挺起你的肩膀！”

下午这一切又会重演一次。我在路上看见你跪在泥上玩玻璃球，袜子上还磨出了洞。我命令你走到我面前，把你赶回家，让你在朋友前丢脸了。袜子很贵，如果你要自己掏钱买就会懂得珍惜了！儿子，想象一下，这是从一个父亲口中说出的话！

你还记得吗？之后我在书房看报，你怯生生地走进来，带着种伤痛的眼神。我把报纸放下看到了你，对于你的打扰很不耐烦。你在门口踌躇。“什么事？”我厉声说。

你什么都没说，但猛地跑过来，搂着我的脖子亲了我一下，那时你的小手臂环抱得更紧了，充满了爱。这爱是上帝在你心中盛开的花朵，即便被忽视也不会凋零。然后你走了，嗒嗒地跑上楼。

儿子，后来报纸从我手中滑落，我心中升起了令人不悦的恐惧。习惯把我变成了什么样子了？我养成了那种爱挑毛病、爱谴责的习惯，只因你是男孩我就如此对待你。不是因为我不爱你，只是因为我对孩子的要求太高了。我是用我自己的标准来要求你。

然而你的性格中还有那么多的善良、优秀和真实。你那颗小小的心脏比笼罩着宽阔山脉的黎明还要大。你跑进来亲吻我、道晚安的自发冲动就证明了这点。儿子，今晚其他事都不再重要。我在黑暗中走到你的床边，惭愧地跪在这里！

这些都无法弥补。我知道在你醒时跟你说这些你是不会明白的，但明天起我会做一个真正的父亲！我要和你成为朋友，为你的痛苦而痛苦，为你的喜悦而喜悦。当不耐烦的想法出现时，我会忍住不说出来。我会一直严肃地对自己说：“他只是个孩子而已，一个小孩子。”

我之前一直把你当作成年男子一样对待，而现在当我看着你时，儿子，你疲惫的身体蜷缩在小床上，我才意识到你还是个婴孩。昨天你还在妈妈的怀里，小脑袋搭在她的肩上。我要求的太多了，太多了。

让我们都试图去理解而不是谴责他人，让我们试着了解人们做事的原因。这会比谴责更有收获、更有趣；它还能培养同情、宽容与善良的心。“包容一切就是了解一切。”

就如约翰逊博士所述：“先生，上帝本身并没有要评判人类——直到末日来临的一刻。”那么你和我又为何要评判呢？记住：

请不要批评、谴责或抱怨。





第三部分　在工作中获得快乐和成就感





第十三章　如此树敌屡试不爽


西奥多·罗斯福出任总统时曾坦言，如果他能做到在75％的情况下是正确的，那么他就达到了自己的最高要求。

如果这位二十世纪最杰出的人物之一能得到的最高分只有75，那么，你和我能得到多少分呢？

如果你觉得自己能维持55％的正确率，那么你就可以去华尔街一天挣一百万了。如果你不能保证55％的正确率，那么为什么还能告诉别人他们是错的呢？

你可以通过一个眼神、一个语调或一个动作就能有效地告诉对方他错了。如果你告诉对方他是错的，你认为会得到对方的认同吗？永远不会。因为你已经直接对他人的智力、判断力、骄傲和自尊射上了一箭。这只会引起对方的反击，却永不可能改变对方的想法。你可以用柏拉图或康德般的缜密逻辑来攻击对方，但别期待对方能改变主意，因为你伤了他的感情。

永远不要以这样的话语开始对话：“我要证明给你看……”这真的很糟糕。这就相当于在说：“我比你聪明。我会为你指点一二从而让你改变主意。”

这其实是在挑战对方，会引起敌意，使听者在你开始说话前就想先和你打一仗。即便是在最具善意的情况下，你也很难改变他人的主意。那么为什么要把事情变得更难，为什么要为自己设下障碍呢？

如果你想证明什么，先不要让别人知道，而要做得巧妙、机智、不被察觉。亚历山大·蒲柏就曾简单扼要地阐述过这个观点：

人只在不知被教诲时接受教诲；

不懂的事要当被遗忘的事来传授。

三百多年前，伽利略曾说过：

你无法教会别人任何东西，只能帮助别人发掘他们已知的东西。

查斯特菲尔德勋爵这样告诉他的儿子：

试着做比别人聪明的人，但是不要告诉别人。

苏格拉底在希腊不停向他的追随者重复：

我只知道一件事，那就是我的无知。

我不认为自己比苏格拉底还聪明，所以我不再对别人说他们的错误，并且我也发现那样做是徒劳无益的。

如果别人说了你认为不正确的话——即便你确认是错的，也最好以这种方式开始你的话：“嗯，我的想法不太一样，但我也有可能是错的，这种事常常发生，如果我错了请纠正我。让我们来分析一下这个问题吧。”

类似于“但我也有可能想错了，这种事常常发生，如果我错了请纠正我。让我们来分析一下这个问题。”这种的语句是有魔力的，而且是正面的魔力。

没有任何人会反对“我或许不对，让我们分析一下问题”的建议。

培训班里的一位同学在和客户打交道的过程中运用了这种方法，他叫哈罗德·莱恩克，是蒙大拿州比林斯市道奇汽车的经销商。他说，在汽车行业的巨大压力下，往往面对顾客的投诉，他的态度都是强硬、冷漠的。这导致他大动肝火、失去生意，带来了总体的不愉快情绪。

他在班里说：“我意识到这样做对我并没有好处，所以尝试了新的方式。我会以这样的话开头：‘我总是为我们车行所犯的错误感到惭愧。这次没有让您满意，请告诉我您的问题。’

“这样说能使对方解除戒备心理，而当顾客的不满情绪宣泄完毕后，他们往往能更理智地解决问题。实际上，好几位客户感谢了我尝试理解的态度，其中两个人甚至还带了他们的朋友来买车。在如此激烈的竞争环境中，我们需要的就是这样的客户，而我相信尊重所有客户的意见并礼貌对待他们会帮助我们在竞争中胜出。”

承认自己可能出错永远不会给你带来麻烦。这能停止一切争论并激励对手也同样做到公平、坦然、大度；这也会使对方愿意承认：他也有可能是错的。

如果你确信对方是错的并且直言相告，那又会发生什么呢？让我来举个例子。S先生是纽约市一名年轻的律师，曾经在美国最高法院为一个很重要的案子进行辩护，案件涉及很大一笔钱和一个重要的法律问题。在辩护过程中，最高法院的一名法官提问他：“法定时效是六年，不是吗？”

S先生呆望着法官数秒，然后直截了当地回答：“法官大人，海事法中并没有法定时效一说。”

“法庭里顿时响起一片嘘声。”S先生在我的一堂培训课中讲到此事，“法庭内似乎静止了。我是正确的，法官是错的。我不喜欢让他意识到这点，但这又能使法官变得友好吗？没有。我依然觉得我方占据了一切法律优势，我也表现得比每一次都好，但是我还是没能说服法官。我直白地指出了如此知识渊博、德高望重的人的错误，这真是太鲁莽了。”

逻辑性强的人是少数的，我们大多数人都充满偏见，带着先入为主的观念，而嫉妒、怀疑、恐惧和自负会使人逐渐枯萎。然而大多数人不愿改变自己的想法，不论是有关个人发型、宗教观念、共产主义还是他们最爱的电影明星的想法。所以如果你总是对别人说起他们的错误，请在每天早晨吃早饭前读一遍下面这段话，它选自詹姆斯·哈维·鲁滨逊所著的引人深思的《思维的形成》一书。

我们可以不夹杂任何阻力和激烈情绪地改变自己的主意，然而当我们被告知自己错了的时候，我们便会排斥别人的指正，变得心硬起来。我们从不推敲信念的形成，然而每当有人要挑战这些信念时，都会激起我们捍卫信念的荒唐热情。很明显，重要的不是那些想法本身，而是我们那受到威胁的自尊……“我的”二字是人类生活中最重要的两个小小的字，而正确应对这二字便成了智慧的起源。不论是“我的”晚餐、“我的”狗、“我的”房子、“我的”爸爸、“我的”国家或是“我的”上帝，都是同样的重要。我们不但拒绝承认我们的表不准、车很破，还对火星运河、爱比克泰德的发音、水杨苷的药用价值、萨尔贡一世的生卒日期有着不可侵犯的信念。我们希望继续保持一直认为是正确的想法，而任何对我们认知的怀疑都会激起憎恶，促使我们去寻找一切继续坚守那些信念的理由。因此，很多我们所谓的“讲道理”都不过是为巩固固有信念而寻找的理由罢了。

著名心理学家卡尔·罗杰斯在《个人形成论》一书中说过：

我发现如果我允许自己理解他人，那将是极具价值的一件事。或许我的观点让你觉得很诧异。我们需要允许自己理解他人吗？我觉得十分需要。我们对大多数（别人口中的）言论的第一反应是评价或评判，而不是理解。当他人表达了感受、态度或信仰后，我们总是习惯于做出这样的第一反应：“说得没错”“这很愚蠢”“这不正常”“这没有道理”“这不对”“这不好”。我们很少允许自己准确了解这话在别人脑中是什么意思。(1)

有一次，我雇了一名室内装饰师为我的家换几个帘子。但是，收到账单时，我心中很不悦。

几天后，一个朋友来串门，看到了新帘子。我跟她说了价钱，她用胜利的口吻大呼：“什么？那太糟糕了！他肯定在你这儿狠狠捞了一笔。”

她说得对吗？没错，她说的是实情，但很少有人愿意听反映了自身判断的实情。所以，被人性驱使，我试着为自己辩护。我说，当然物美价廉是最好的，但是质量、艺术品位和低廉的价格无法共存云云。

第二天，又有一个朋友到家里来看到了帘子，她非常欣赏并表现出极高的热情，还说她多希望自己有钱为自己家也添置如此精致的物件。我的反应截然不同。我说：“事实上，我自己也买不起。我买贵了，现在很后悔。”

当我们犯错的时候，我们会向自己承认。如果处理得温和得当，我们也愿意向他人承认自己的错误，而且从这种坦诚和大度中找到自豪感。但如果有人想硬塞给我们这不受欢迎的事实，我们则不再愿意承认自己的问题。

美国南北战争期间，最著名的报纸编辑霍勒斯·格里利曾强烈反对林肯的政策。他认为自己可以通过一系列的争论、嘲笑与谩骂迫使林肯接受他的意见。他日复一日，年复一年地进行着这些尖酸刻薄的活动，甚至还在林肯总统被布斯刺杀前的晚上给他写过一封粗暴、刻薄、嘲讽、颇具人身攻击意味的信。

然而格里利种种刻薄的做法是否让林肯接纳了他的意见呢？完全没有。嘲讽与谩骂永远无法做到这点。

如果你想得到如何与人相处、管理自己、提高自己的好建议，请阅读本杰明·富兰克林的自传——这是最引人入胜的传记故事之一，也是美国文学中的经典著作。在书中，本·富兰克林告诉我们，他是如何征服好辩的坏习惯并把自己转变为美国史上最有能力、最文雅、最有外交手段的人。

当本·富兰克林还是一个浮躁的年轻人时，一天，一位年迈的智者把他拉到一旁，用几个尖锐的事实给了他当头一棒：

本，你实在让人无法忍受，你的意见中总是带有对其他想法的攻击。它们太具冒犯性以至于人们已经不拿你的话当回事了。你的朋友们觉得你不在时他们玩得更尽兴。你觉得自己知道得很多，根本听不进别人的意见。实际上，没人想要告诉你任何事，因为那样做会令人不悦也太麻烦了。因此你的知识将无法超越现有的水平，而现在知道的也有限。

富兰克林明智之处便是他谦虚地接受了这智慧性的批判。他的胸怀足够宽广，头脑也足够聪明，所以他意识到了其中的道理，感觉到自己正在走向失败和社交灾难的不归路。于是他悬崖勒马，改变了自己那傲慢、武断的处事方式。

富兰克林说：“我给自己制定了一条规矩：克制住对他人想法的直接否定以及对自己观念的肯定。我甚至禁止自己运用那些表示固定思维的词语，例如‘当然’‘毫无疑问’等。与其让他人改变，不如先改变自己，于是我采纳了新的表述方式：‘我的看法是’‘我理解的是’‘我猜这件事是这样的’或者‘目前来讲我认为’。当对方表述了我认为不正确的观念时，我克制住激烈反驳对方、即刻证明其理论荒谬的快感。在回复时我会首先承认在某些情况下对方的观点是正确的，但在当前的情形中，我有不同的看法。我很快便发现了这一变化带来的好处，我所参与的对话能够在更愉悦的氛围中进行了。我展现出的更谦虚的态度使人们更容易接受、更少反对我的观点了。如果我被证明是错误的，我的羞辱感减少了；而如果我是对的，人们也更容易放弃他们错误的观点，采纳正确的意见。

“而这种我一开始需要违背自然倾向、强迫自己接纳的方式最终已变得如此简单和习以为常。这五十年来，或许再也没有人从我口中听到过武断的表述。我觉得一切都归功于这个习惯（在此之上是我正直的人格），才能让我在提议建立新制度、改变旧制度时深得民心，在成为公共理事会成员后产生了重大影响。但我从不是一名好的演讲者。我不会雄辩，在选词时犹豫不决，语法上也不见得正确，然而我通常可以表达出自己的观点。”

北卡罗来纳州国王山的凯瑟琳·A．奥瑞德是纺织厂的工业工程主管，她在一堂课中讲起了她在上课前后处理敏感问题的不同方法：

“我的职责之一便是为生产者建立和维护奖励制度及标准，从而激励他们制造更多的纱线。当我们只生产两三种纺线的时候，原本的系统还不错，但最近我们拓展了进货渠道，提高了生产能力，已经可以同时制造十二种纺线了，这时的奖励制度已经无法公平地反映员工的工作量并给予他们增强生产力的动力了。我设计出一套新的按纺织类别进行奖励的系统，我带着这套系统走进会议室，立志要向管理层证明我的方法是对的。我详尽地解释了他们的方法为何不好，为何不公平，而我有一切问题的答案。可是，最后我败得一塌糊涂。我太急于维护自己的立场，以至于没有给他人留下坦诚并优雅地承认问题的机会。这注定死路一条。

“参加了几堂培训课后，我清楚地认识到了自己的问题。于是，我再次召集了一次会议，而这次我向他们询问了他们的看法及问题出在哪里。我们探讨了每个方面，我也征求了他们的改革意见。我在适当的时机里提出了几个低调的建议，引领他们主动走入了我的思维模式。所以，当我在会议末尾提出了那个具体方案后，大家兴高采烈地接纳了。

“我现在彻底懂得了，如果你直截了当地告诉别人他的错误，你不仅无法得到任何建设性结果，还会造成很大的伤害。你只是成功地剥夺了对方的尊严，使自己变成任何对话中不受欢迎的一方。”

让我们再看一个例子，请记住，我引用的这些例子都是具有代表性的。R．V．克劳来是纽约一家木材公司的销售人员，他承认自己多年来一直不留情面地指出冷漠的木材检查员的错误，也在争论中屡居上风。然而这并没有带来任何正面的结果。“这些木材检查员就像棒球裁判一样。”克劳来说，“他们一旦做出判决便永不再改变。”

克劳来先生意识到，他赢得了争论中的胜利，但公司损失了数万美金。所以他在上我的培训班时发誓要改变自己处理问题的方式，放弃争论。结果又如何？下面是他在班里讲的他的故事：

“一天早晨我办公室里的电话响起了。电话另一端是个怒气冲冲、忧心忡忡的人，他告诉我，我们运给他工厂的木材全都不符合要求。他的工厂已经停止卸货，并要求我们立刻想办法把所有货物拉走。卸下四分之一的木材后，他们的木材检查员汇报说这批木材低于标准55％，在这种情况下，他们当然拒绝签收这批木材。“我立刻开车驶向他的工厂，路上想着处理此事的最佳办法。以往遇到这种事，我会复述木材评级的规定，并用我曾从事木材检查的全部知识和经验来试图说服对方的检查者，让他相信我们的木材实际是符合等级规定的，而他则搞错了检查规则。然而，这一次我想试着用培训班中学到的法则来解决问题。

“我到达工厂后发觉采购员和木材检查者的脸色都很阴郁，为争吵做好了准备。我们一起走到卸货车那里，我让他们继续卸货，好让我观察一切程序。我让检查者挑出不合格的木材，并把合格的放到另一堆。

“观察了一会儿之后，我发现他的检查过于严格了，他根本理解错了标准规格。我们卸的是白松木，我知道这位检查者是实木专家但对白松木不甚了解，而我对白松木却很熟悉。我对对方的检查方式提出了质疑吗？没有。我继续观察，并逐步询问他为何认为某些木材是不合格的。我丝毫没有暗示他是错的，我一再重申我询问只因想知道今后如何提供更合意的木材。

“我非常友好的提问和合作的态度以及对他们检查结果的肯定缓解了我们之间的关系，也使对方的态度逐渐缓和。我无意间的一句评论引起了他对自己判断的怀疑——或许这不合格的一堆中有些其实是合格的，而他们所要求达到的标准实际是属于更昂贵的一个等级的。不过我很小心地不让他觉得这想法是我灌输给他的。

“慢慢地，他整个态度都改变了。最后他承认他对检查白松木并不在行，并开始边卸货边询问我的意见。我给他解释合格的标准并一再确认我们不会让他们接受任何他们不满意的木材。最后他终于承认了自己每一次往不合格堆放木材时都充满了愧疚，其实是他们的错误，他们订的木材并不是自己需要的等级。

“最后的结果是：我走后他们又重新检查了一遍所有木材并全部接收了，而我们收到了全款。

“仅仅在那一件事中，这个小小的方法和避免直接指出对方错误的决心，就为公司挽回了损失的大笔金额。何况，这种做法所维护的信誉则是金钱所无法衡量的。”

马丁·路德·金曾被问到，身为和平主义者的他为何会敬仰战无不胜的空军上将丹尼尔·詹姆斯，即当时美国最显赫的黑人军官。马丁·路德·金回答道：“我以他人的准则而不是我自己的准则看待他人。”

无独有偶，有一次，罗伯特·E．李将军在和南军总统杰弗逊·戴维斯谈话时，他用最华丽的词语赞美了他手下的一位军官。旁边一位军官惊呆了，“将军，”他说道，“你难道不知道那个被你如此夸赞的人就是不放过任何机会诽谤你的大仇人吗？”“我知道。”李将军说，“但是总统问的是我对他的看法，而不是他对我的看法。”

对了，我在此章中讲到的东西都不是什么新鲜内容。两千年前，耶稣就说过：“立刻赞同你的敌人。”

在耶稣诞生前的两千两百年，埃及的阿托伊法老就曾对他儿子提出这样一句明智的建议，今天的我们依然迫切需要着这句话。法老教诲到：“要懂得外交手段，这样才能保住你的立场。”

换言之，别与你的客户、配偶或敌人争执；别指出他们的错误；别激怒他们；要多运用外交手段。




尊重他人的观点。永远别说：“你错了。”

第十四章　一滴蜂蜜


你的脾气被引爆，你要给对方好好上一堂课，你会享受这种发泄的快感。然而对方呢？他也会享受这份快感吗？你那好战的口吻、敌视的态度会让对方更容易同意你的观点吗？

伍德罗·威尔逊曾说过：“如果你双拳紧握地走过来，我可以保证，我也会在第一时间握紧双拳。但如果你走过来说：‘让我们坐下来商量问题。如果我们的意见不一样，让我们找出不同的原因和问题之所在。’那么我们立刻就会发现，我们的观点并非大相径庭，相左的观点少，相同的观点多。如果我们有合作的耐心、诚意和愿望，那么我们就能达成合作。”

没有人比洛克菲勒更推崇这句话了。1915年，洛克菲勒是科罗拉多最受鄙夷的人。美国工业历史上最血腥的一次示威就发生在科罗拉多，并震惊了全州长达两年时间。愤怒、好斗的矿工要求从科罗拉多燃料与铁矿公司那里得到更高的薪水，而洛克菲勒正是这家公司的控股人。大量财产遭到破坏，军队也被动用来镇压示威，很多示威者被枪击，身体被子弹打得千疮百孔，现场血流成河，惨不忍睹。

在那样的时刻里，空气中弥漫着的都是仇恨。洛克菲勒希望能说服示威者，而他做到了。他是如何做到的呢？请听下面的故事。洛克菲勒在表示了几周的友好后向示威群众代表做了一场演说，整个演说可谓是精彩绝伦，更是带来了惊人的效果。它平息了几乎要吞噬洛克菲勒的仇恨浪潮，还为他带来了不少仰慕者。这场演说用友好的方式陈述了事实，让示威者返回了岗位并只字不提不提之前暴力争取的提薪一事。

下面是那场演说的开头部分，请注意它表现出的友好态度。别忘了，洛克菲勒面对的听众是几天前希望把他吊死在酸苹果树上的人，然而洛克菲勒的语气比面对一群医学传教士还要友好和优雅。他的演说里通篇都是类似这样的句子和词组：“来到这里是我的荣幸”“我拜访过你们的家，见过你们中很多人的妻子和儿女，所以我们今天是以朋友而不是陌生人的方式见面……”“相互友好的氛围”“我们的共同利益”“承蒙你们的邀请我才能站在这里”。

洛克菲勒是这样开始这段演说的：“今天是我生命中值得纪念的日子，我第一次有幸同时见到我们伟大公司的员工代表、高级职员和主管。我可以向你们保证，来到这里是我的荣幸，在我有生之年里都不会忘记今天。如果今天的会面是两周前举行的，那么对于台下大多数人来说我还是个陌生人，我也只能认出台下的几张面孔。然而上周我有幸参观了南部煤炭厂的所有宿舍，和当天在场的每个员工代表一对一地交谈。我拜访过你们的家，见过你们中很多人的妻子和儿女后，所以我们今天是以朋友而不是陌生人的方式见面，也是在这种相互友好的氛围中，我很高兴有机会来和你们探讨我们的共同利益。

“这是公司高级职员和主管的会议，我没有这个荣幸加入其中的任何一方，所以承蒙你们的邀请我才能站在这里。然而我又觉得和你们紧密相连，因为我代表着股东和董事会。”

这难道不是化敌为友的演讲艺术的最佳范例吗？

假设洛克菲勒用了另一种方法，假设他和矿工争执，抛出了毁灭性的真相，假设他用语气和语调影射了对方的谬误，假设他运用了全部逻辑规则证明了对方就是错的，那么接下来会发生什么呢？他会激起更多的愤怒、憎恨和反抗。

如果他人对你充满了不满和厌恶，那么，你即便是用尽逻辑推理的方式也无法令对方采纳你的观点。爱责骂的家长、爱控制的老板和丈夫、爱抱怨的妻子都应该意识到这一点，人们不愿改变自己的想法，你无法强迫或驱使他人同意我们的意见。然而如果我们足够温和与友好，他们便可能同样温和与友好地被引导着采纳我们的意见。

林肯在一百多年前说过类似的话：

“一滴蜂蜜比一加仑胆汁能吸引更多的苍蝇。”这句话古老而确切。所以如果你想让一个人拥护你的立场，请首先说服对方相信你是他真正的朋友。那便是一滴俘虏人心的蜂蜜，也是影响对方逻辑的捷径——不论你怎么认为。

商界管理者已经懂得，友好地对待抗议者会受益无穷。比如，怀特汽车公司工厂里的两千五百名员工因要求加薪并建立工会车间而进行大罢工，但当时的公司总裁罗伯特·F．布莱克没有发火，没有指责，没有像暴君一样放出威胁之词，他反而表扬了罢工者。他在克利夫兰的报纸中发表了一篇公告，表扬了他们的“和平罢工方式”。为了丰富罢工者的闲暇生活他还买了一堆棒球球棒和手套，邀请他们在空地上打球。有的人更喜欢打保龄球，他便为那些人租了保龄球场。

布莱克先生的友好举动奏效了，那是友好常能带来的作用，它赢得了更多的友好。于是罢工者借来了扫帚、铲子、垃圾推车，开始捡工厂周围的火柴、纸屑和烟头。想象一下！想象罢工者在争取更高工资和工会车间的同时打扫着工厂周围的卫生，这样的事在美国悠长而混乱的工人奋斗史中闻所未闻。那次罢工在一周内就协商解决了，没有造成反感或仇恨。

外表如上帝、讲话如耶和华的丹尼尔·韦伯斯特是最成功的出庭律师之一。他总是用最友好的语言引出他的论证，例如：“希望陪审团考虑”“这一点或许值得思考”“我相信你一定不会忽视如下事实”“带着对人性的认识，你能轻而易举地看到这些事实的重要性”。没有威吓，没有高压手段，没有强加于人的观点，韦伯斯特以他那温和、平静而友好的方式而名扬四海。

你或许不需要平息一场罢工或是在陪审团面前发言，但你有可能需要压低房屋租金。这种友好的方式能帮上忙吗？让我们看看下面的例子。

工程师O．L．斯特劳布想要得到房租折扣，而他知道房东是冷漠无情的，他该怎么办？斯特劳布先生在培训课的演讲中说道：“我写信通知他，我的租房合同到期后就不再续租了，而事实上我并不想搬家。如果房租能降低一些，我很愿意续租。这是看似渺茫的事，其他房客也试过，但都以失败告终。每个人都对我说，房东很难打交道。然而我对自己说：‘我正在上如何跟人打交道的培训班，所以我要在他身上做实验，看看是否有成效。’

“他和他的秘书收到我的信后过来见了我。我在门口和他们友好地打招呼，表现得充满善意和热情。我没有上来就抱怨房租上调的事，我只是夸他们的公寓多么舒适。相信我，我是“真诚地赞美并不吝惜赞美之词”的。我还赞美了他经营公寓的方式。我说我很想继续租下去，但是我付不起房租了。

“房东从来没有从房客那儿得到过如此高的肯定，他受宠若惊。“后来他开始跟我讲述他遇到的麻烦，抱怨其他房客。有一个房客给他写了十四封信，其中有些信还颇具侮辱性。还有一个房客威胁房东说如果不能保证他楼上的人不再打呼噜，他就要违约提前搬走。他说：‘遇到像你这样称心如意的房客是多么让人欣慰啊。’接着，不用我请求，他就主动提出要给我稍微降低房租。我希望他能降低更多，便表明了我可以接受的价格，而他欣然接受了。

“他离开时转身问我：‘我能为你做些什么装修方面的事吗？’

“如果我按其他房客的方式索要折扣，我相信我也会以失败告终。最后赢得胜利的只会是友好的、富有同情心和感恩之情的方式。”

宾夕法尼亚州匹兹堡的迪恩·伍德考克是当地电力公司某部门的主管。他负责安排他的员工维修电线杆顶部的某个设备。这个工作原先是其他部门负责的，前不久才转交给伍德考克的部门。虽然他的员工都接受过这项技能的培训，但这是第一次被要求实际操作。部门中的每个人都很好奇自己是否能完成以及该如何去完成这项工作。伍德考克、他手下的几位经理以及其他公共设施部门的成员都前来参观他们工作，很多汽车、卡车停放在那里，很多人站在电线杆下围观顶部的那两位孤独的工人工作。

伍德考克环视四周，发现有个人下车后掏出了相机，开始为这个场景拍照。公共设施公司的人极度重视公共关系，伍德考克忽然意识到这场景对于拍照者来说就像是一群人被指派做两人就能完成的任务，于是他朝那位拍照者走了过去。

“我看到你对我们的工作好像很感兴趣。”

“是的，我妈妈会更感兴趣。她买了你们公司的股票，这个场景会让她大跌眼镜的，她可能会发现她的投资不那么明智。我一直在告诉她，你们这样的公司有好多低效环节，这照片就是好的证明。或许报纸也会对这照片感兴趣的。”

“看起来似乎真的是这样，不是吗？如果站在你的位置，我也会这样想，但在这次这个特殊情况里……”迪恩·伍德考克解释，这是他带领的部门第一次执行这类任务，而公司上上下下的人都非常感兴趣。他向那个人解释说，一般情况下这就是两个人的工作。拍照者放下了相机，和伍德考克先生握手并感谢他花时间向他解释情况。

迪恩·伍德考克的友好方式避免了公司一场令人难为情的公关危机。

培训班里的另一名学生杰拉尔德·H．韦恩，他来自新罕布什尔的立托顿，也用友好的方式在一项损失索赔协议中达成了满意的和解。

“早春的时候地上的冰还未融化，又下了一场大雨。雨水通常会流到沟渠里，然而这次却找到了新的路径，直接淹没了一块建筑用地，而我刚在那里盖好房子。

“雨水没有流走而是积聚在了房子地基周围，并渗透了地下室的水泥层，导致水泥层破裂，淹没了地下室。这使得供热和供水设备全被摧毁，损失超过了两千美金，而我没有任何这类损失的保险。

“但是，不久我就得知这块地的主人没有在房子周围做好排水设施，也就是说这个问题本是可以避免的，于是我约好和他会面。在开车到他办公室的二十五分钟的路程中，我仔细地回想了这件事的始末，并牢牢记住培训班里讲过的法则，我觉得表现愤怒是无法达成任何有意义的结果的。我抵达后竭力保持着平静，一开始先和他聊了他最近的西印度群岛之旅。后来，当我觉得时机合适时，我提起了水灾的‘小损失’。他很快便同意尽到所有他该尽的责任，协同我解决这个问题。

“几天后他打来电话，说他会赔偿我的损失并且做好排水设施以避免类似的事再次发生。

“虽然这是对方的责任，但倘若我没有以友好的态度着手处理此事，那么要让对方负全责还是困难重重的。”

多年前，我还是一个小男孩，当我赤脚走在通往密苏里西北部一所学校的小树林中时，我读到了一则关于太阳和风的伊索寓言。太阳和风儿争执着谁更强大。风儿说：“我会证明我更强大。看到那边穿棉衣的老人了吗？我肯定能比你更快地剥去他的外套。”

于是太阳躲到云层中，风儿开始吹啊吹，几乎吹成了龙卷风，然而它吹得越凶猛，老人把外套抓得越紧。

最后风儿平息下来，放弃了。这时太阳从乌云背后出来了，和蔼地对着老人微笑。然后，老人擦去挂在眉毛上的汗珠，脱下了外套。太阳对风儿说，温和与友好永远比狂暴和蛮力要强大。

一滴蜂蜜比一加仑胆汁能吸引更多苍蝇，懂得这个道理的人日复一日地发挥着温和与友好的积极作用。马里兰州卢瑟威尔市的F．盖尔·康纳的事例就证明了这一点，这是他第三次把那辆刚买了四个月的车送进修理厂。他在班里说：“很明显，与服务部经理的谈话、理论或叫嚷都无法给我的问题带来一个满意的结局。

“我走进车行，要求见他们的老板怀特先生。等了一会儿后，我被带入了怀特的办公室。我介绍了自己，并告诉他我是在朋友的推荐下在车行买了车，因为朋友告诉我这里的价格非常有竞争力，服务也是一流的。他听我说这些时满意地笑了，然后我解释了在服务部门遇到的问题。我补充道：‘我觉得最好让您知道有可能破坏贵车行声誉的情况。’他感谢我让他注意到了这件事，并且向我保证我的问题一定会解决。他不但亲自参与了这次维修，还在维修期间把他的车暂时借给了我。”

伊索是克洛伊索斯宫殿里的奴隶，他在耶稣之前六百年开始讲述不朽的寓言故事。而他在两千六百年前的雅典所表述的真理在今天的波士顿和伯明翰照样适用。太阳比风儿更快地使你脱下外套；和善、友好和感恩的方式也比世上全部的咆哮和暴躁能更好地改变他人的观念。

记住林肯说过的话：“一滴蜂蜜比一加仑胆汁能吸引更多的苍蝇。”




从友好开始。





第十五章　苏格拉底的秘密


和别人对话时，不要一开始就讨论存在异议的事。要先从双方意见一致的事开始讨论，别忘了不停地强调你们的共同点。如果可以的话，要一直强调你们的最终目标是一样的，唯一的不同只是达成目标的方式。

让对方从一开始就对你说“没错”而不是“不对”。

哈里·奥沃思特利特教授说：“一个否定的回应是最难逾越的障碍。当你说了‘不’以后，你的自尊心会要求你始终保持一致。或许后来你会发现不该说‘不’，但是你会顾虑到宝贵的自尊心！说了一句话以后，你就会想要贯彻到底。因此，在肯定中开始是至关重要的。”(1)

游刃有余的交谈者从一开始就会得到好几个“是”的回应，这便把听者带入了一系列肯定式的心理过程中。这就像台球一样，当你把球推向一个方向时，若想使球旋转则要多发些力，若想使球往反方向反弹则需要大很多的力气。

这里的心理规律很显著。当对方认真地说“不”时，他说的远远不止这一个字。这时，他的腺体、神经和肌肉都进入了反对的状态。通常会有微小的，但有时也很明显的身体上的退缩或准备退缩的状态。简而言之，整个肌肉神经系统都进入了自我保护机制，拒绝接受任何事情。然而当人们说“是”时，这些退缩活动都不会出现，整个机制是积极向前的、接纳和开放的状态。因此，如果我们一开始得到的肯定回应越多，就越有可能成功推广我们的提议。

让人们给予肯定的回应其实只是一个很简单的技巧，然而人们却往往忽视了它！人们仿佛总是一开始就用与他人对抗的方式为自己寻找重要感。

如果学生、顾客、孩子、丈夫或妻子从一开始就说了“不”，那么我们便需要天使的智慧与耐心才能把这布满荆棘的反对意见转化成肯定。

纽约市格林威治储蓄银行的出纳詹姆斯·艾伯森正是运用了“让他人说是”这个方法挽回了差点流失的一位客户。

艾伯森先生说：“一个人来开户，我递给他一份常规的申请表。他欣然回答了几个问题，对表格上的其他问题却拒绝回答。

“在学习这堂人际关系课之前，我会这样告诉他，如果他拒绝向银行提供信息，我们一定会拒绝他的申请。我对自己以往的行为感到愧疚，能够给人下最终审判自然是有快感的事。我强调了我们的制度，而且银行也不能乱了规矩。但是那样的态度肯定不会让来存钱的客户觉得受欢迎、受重视。

“今天早晨我决定运用常识，一开始先不说银行的需要，而是要询问客户的需求。最重要的是，我希望从一开始就把他带入说‘是’的状态。所以我同意了他的做法，告诉他他拒绝提供的信息并不是必需的。”

“我又对他说：‘但是假设您去世时账户里还有钱，难道您不希望银行能依法帮您把它转到您所授权的最亲近的人那里吗？’

“‘当然希望啦。’他回答。

“我又继续问道：‘那么，难道您不愿意提供这个人的姓名，好让我们在意外情况发生时能顺利把钱转给此人吗？’

“他再次回答了：‘当然愿意呀。’

“这位年轻人的态度逐渐平和下来了，当他意识到银行要求填写的信息并非是出于银行的利益时，他的观点发生了变化。这位年轻人离开银行时，不但给了我他的全部信息，还在我的建议下开了一个信托账号，指定他的母亲为受益人，也填写了有关他母亲的一切资料。

“我发现如果一开始就引领他进入肯定的思维模式中，这样他便会忘了之前为何要坚持以及在坚持什么，并愉快地做了一切我建议他做的事。”

西屋电气公司的一名销售代表约瑟夫·埃里森给我们讲了这样一个故事：“公司很希望当地的一个商人能成为他们的顾客，但我的前辈们已经向他电话推销了十年，也未能卖出去任何东西。我接管这个领域后也定期打电话向他推销，在长达三年的时间里，也毫无结果。在这十三年的电话交谈和商品推销后，我们终于成功地卖了几个发动机给他。如果这些发动机能够正常运行的话，他将会订购几百台发动机，这是我的理解。

“我知道这几个发动机不会有问题，所以当我三周后向他致电时，我是兴高采烈的。

“总工程师平静地向我们宣布了一个令人震惊的消息：‘埃里森，我们不能买更多的发动机。’

“‘为什么？’我震惊地问，‘究竟为什么？’

“‘因为你们的发动机散热不好，我都无法把手放在发动机上。’

“我知道争执无济于事，我之前曾经有过太多惨痛的教训，所以我想起了‘让对方说是’的方式。

“‘史密斯先生，你看，’我说，‘我完全同意。如果那些发动机过热你的确不该买。你肯定见过比国家电器制造商协会标准热度要低的发动机，对不对？’

“他说是的。这是我得到的第一个‘是’。

“‘国家电器制造商协会要求设计合理的发动机热度只可比室内温度高72华氏度。是不是？’

“‘没错。’他回答，‘非常正确。但是你们的发动机超过了那个温度。’

“我没有和他争执，只是问他：‘工厂里面的温度是多少？’

“‘哦，’他说，‘大概75华氏度。’

“我回应道：‘那么如果室内75华氏度，再加72度，那就是147度。如果你把手放在147度的流水下会烫伤的吧？’

“他再次给出肯定的答复。

“于是我说：‘这样的话是不是本来也不该用手去碰发动机呢？’

“‘嗯，我猜你是对的。’他承认道。我们又聊了一会儿，后来他就让秘书订了价值三万五千美金的发动机，这相当于接下来一整个月的营业额。

“浪费了多年时间，损失了上万美金后，我才懂得了争执无用的道理。用他人的立场思考问题并能让对方说‘是的’‘是的’才是最有利也是最有趣的方式。”

赞助了我们加州奥克兰培训班的艾迪·斯诺给我们讲述了他是如何因为店主懂得让他说“是”而成了店里的一名忠诚顾客的。艾迪喜欢用弓箭打猎，并花了很多钱在当地一间店铺里购置设备。当他的哥哥来看他时，他想从这家店里租一把弓，但销售人员说他们不外租，所以艾迪给另一家店打电话讲述了事情的经过：

“一位非常和蔼可亲的人接了电话，他给我的回答和另一家店完全不同。他说他很抱歉，他们停止了租弓箭的业务，因为他们负担不起了。之后他问我以前是否租过，我说：‘是的，几年前租过。’他猜测我那时应该付了25—30美金租金，我再次说‘没错’。后来他问我，我是否是喜欢省钱的人，我自然给予了肯定的回答。对方继续说道他们有一套弓箭正在促销，包含了所有必需的设备，一共34.95美金，仅需比租器材多花4.95美金就能买下这一套器材。他最后解释道，这就是他们停止出租器材的原因。我认为他的话合理吗？我的肯定回答使我买下了那一套器材。我去取货时还顺便在那家店里买了其他几样东西，后来慢慢地成了他们的常客。”

自喻为“希腊的牛虻”的苏格拉底是世上最伟大的哲学家之一。他做了有史以来只有少数人做到的事：他大大地改变了别人的思维方式。在他辞世两千四百年后的今天，他被奉为影响辩证体系的最具智慧的辩者。

他到底用了怎样的方式呢？他告诉别人“你是错的”了吗？哦，不，苏格拉底不会做如此不精明的事。他的辩证方法被称作“苏格拉底法”，而这方法就是基于让对方说“是”。他向对方提出一系列使对方不得不说“是”的问题。他在一个又一个的问题上得到肯定的答复，最后得到一箩筐的“是”。他会继续提问下去，直到最后对手在不经意间发现自己居然拥护着几分钟前还尖锐反驳的结论。

今后当我们想告诉对方“你是错的”时，让我们记住苏格拉底的做法，提一些温和的问题，能得到对方肯定答复的问题。

中国有句谚语，蕴含着东方的古老智慧：“轻履者行远。”

中国人用了五千年的时间揣摩人性、学习智者的思想，终于获得了敏锐的洞察力：“轻履者行远。”




立刻获取对方的赞同。

第十六章　如何与他人合作


你是否更相信自己发现的而不是别人灌输给你的思想呢？如果是这样，那么你把自己的观念强加于人岂不是很不理智？难道不该以提建议的方式引导对方想出你所赞同的结论吗？这样才更明智吧！

费城的阿道夫·塞尔兹是车行的销售经理，也是我的培训课里的学生。他发现自己面对的是一群垂头丧气、无组织无纪律的销售人员，迫切需要给他们注入一些热情。于是，他召集了一次销售会议，让员工说出他们对他的期待。员工一边说，他一边抄写在黑板上。然后他说：“我会达到你们所有的期待。现在请你们告诉我，我有权对你们做出什么样的期待。”员工们毫不犹豫地回答：忠实、诚实、积极主动、乐观、富有团队精神，而且每天八小时对工作的热情投入。会议在更高的士气和启示中结束了，会后有个员工竟自动要求一天工作十四个小时。塞尔兹告诉我，销售额一下子显著增长了很多倍。

塞尔兹说：“员工们和我做了一个交换。只要我尽职尽责，他们就下定决心对他们的任务负责。询问他们的需求和渴望正是他们所需的强心剂。”

没有人喜欢被推销或被指使。我们更愿认为自己是出于自愿而买某物、做某事的。我们喜欢被问到自己的需求和想法。

让我们再来看一看尤金·韦森的例子，他在领悟了这个真理之前曾白白损失了数千美金的佣金。韦森先生向设计和纺织品业工作室提供草图，连续三年的时间里，他每周都向纽约某知名设计师致电询问结果。韦森先生说：“他从未拒绝见我，但是也从未买过我们的图。他总是很认真地翻看我的样图，然后说：‘不行，韦森先生，看来今天我们没什么可以交易。’”

失败了一百五十次后，韦森觉得自己一定是禁锢了思维，于是决心每周用一个晚上的时间学习影响人类行为的方法，从而得到灵感并产生更多的热情。

他决定尝试一种新方式。他带着手中好几幅未完成的草图去到了买方的办公室。“如果可能的话我希望你能帮我个忙。”他说，“这里是几张没画完的图。你能否告诉我，换作是你，你要如何完成这些图才能使他们派上用场？”

买方默默地看着那些图，终于说了：“把它们在我这儿放几天吧，韦森。过几天来见我。”

三天后，韦森回去见他，听取了他的建议，然后他把图纸拿回了工作室，按买方的意愿完成了那些图。结果呢？设计草图全部被采用。

从那之后，买方又从韦森那里购买了很多图纸，这些图纸全都是按照买方的意见画的。韦森先生说：“我知道了为何之前几年都会失败。我一直渴望他买我希望他得到的东西，后来我彻底改变了方式，我让他买他想买的东西。这使对方觉得图纸是自己的设计，而这也的确是事实。我不需要向他推销什么，他自然就买了。”

让对方认为主意是自己出的，这种方式不仅在商界、政界行得通，在家中也同样奏效。俄克拉荷马州塔尔萨市的鲍尔·M．戴维斯就在培训班中讲过他是如何运用这个法则的：

“我和家人开始了一次非常有趣的观光旅行，我们玩得非常尽兴。我一直渴望参观葛底茨堡的战争遗址、费城的独立大厅还有我们的首都。福吉谷、詹姆斯敦和重建的威廉斯堡殖民村都是我观光清单上排名最高的几个景点。

“3月时，我的妻子南希提到，她计划我们夏天的旅行要去西部的几个州，参观新墨西哥、亚利桑那、加利福尼亚和内华达的景点。她已经期待去这些地方旅行很多年了。但是很明显，我们无法同时实现我们的梦想。

“我们的女儿安妮刚在中学里修过一堂美国历史课，她对改变我们国家的重要事件非常感兴趣。我问她如果在下次旅行中能去在课本上读到的那些地方，她是否愿意。她说她非常愿意。

“两天后的一个晚上，我们围坐在晚饭桌边。南希宣布如果我们同意的话，我们这次将去东部几个州旅行，这对安妮会很有意义，对一家人来说也是令人激动的旅行。我们都同意了。”

一个X光仪器工厂也运用了同样的策略，把仪器销售到布鲁克林最大的医院里。这家医院正在盖附楼，而这里将成为美国最先进的X光中心。L医生是X光部门的主管，被各种推销自家品牌的销售代表吵得喘不过气来。

其中一家公司最高明。他们更懂得人性，于是写了这样的一封信：

我们厂最近研制出了一系列全新的X光设备，我们刚收到第一批货，它们堪称完美。我们知道这是事实，并希望还能精益求精。所以如果您能抽出时间看看这些仪器并提出如何能使它们更好地为您效劳，我们将不胜感激。我们知道您的时间宝贵，所以很愿意派车在您方便的时间去接您。

培训班中的L医生讲起这段故事时说：“收到那封信我很惊讶，简直受宠若惊。在这之前还没有任何一个X光厂家向我征求意见，这使我感觉到自己的重要性。那一周我每天晚上都很忙，但是我取消了一个晚饭应酬去看了他们的机器，我越看越喜欢那些机器。

“没人试图卖给我什么，我离开时觉得这个购买决定完全是自发的。我是自己把那些高品质的产品推销给自己的。后来我订购并安装了他们的机器。”

拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生在《自助》一文中曾写道：“在每个天才之作中，我们都能发现被自己遗弃的想法，它们带着生疏的威严回到我们的世界里。”

伍德罗·威尔逊在任总统期间，爱德华·M．豪斯上校对国家乃至世界来说，地位举足轻重。威尔逊常与豪斯上校密谈，询问他的意见。他对豪斯上校的依赖比谁都多，甚至超过了对内阁的依赖。

豪斯上校运用了何种方式来影响总统呢？我们有幸得知了答案，因为豪斯上校曾亲自对阿瑟·D．豪登·史密斯讲述过这个答案。史密斯在《周六晚报》中引用了豪斯的话：

“豪斯说，‘我认识了总统以后，明白了最能说服他的办法便是在不经意间把想法灌入他的脑海里，他便会产生兴趣，并且自行思考这个问题。这种方法第一次奏效时纯属偶然。我一直到白宫拜访他，希望他能批准一项他并不支持的政策。几天后，在一次晚餐的饭桌上，我意外地听到他提出了这项政策，仿佛是他自己的主意一般。’”

豪斯是否打断了总统并说“这不是你的主意，是我的”？当然没有，豪斯不会做如此愚笨的事。他不在乎如何抢功，他只想看到结果，所以他就让威尔逊认为那是他自己的主意了。不仅如此，豪斯还让威尔逊因这些想法而得到了公信度。

让我们记住，我们接触的每个人都有和伍德罗·威尔逊一样的人性。所以让我们运用起豪斯上校的技巧吧。

加拿大美丽的新不伦瑞克省的一个人就在我身上运用了这个技巧，拿下了我的一笔生意。那时我正打算在新不伦瑞克钓鱼、划船。所以我向那里的旅游局写信索要一些信息。显然，我的名字被加进了通讯录中，因为我立刻就收到了无数信件、宣传册及印刷出来的各种营地和导游的介绍，这些文件弄得我眼花缭乱，我不知道如何选择。而有一个营地的主人做了聪明的事。他寄给了我几个曾住在他营地的纽约人的姓名和电话号码，让我自行探索。

我惊讶地发现，我认识名单中的一个人。于是我向他致电，问询了他的看法后，我把到达日期发给了那个营地。

其他人都试着向我推销，而这个人让我自己向自己做推销，这个机构赢了。

两千五百年前老子说过的一段话现如今依然能让这本书的读者受益无穷：

“江海所以能为百谷王者，以其善下之，故能为百谷王。是以欲上民，必以言下之；欲先民，必以身后之。是以圣人处上而民不重，处前而民不害……”




让对方觉得主意是自己的。





第十七章　人人都喜欢的诉求


我是在密苏里乡下杰西·詹姆斯村附近长大的。有一次，我拜访了密苏里科尔尼的詹姆斯农场——那时杰西·詹姆斯的儿子住在那里。

他的妻子给我讲了杰西在火车上偷盗后成立了钱库并让周围农民拿这些钱还房贷的故事。

杰西·詹姆斯或许认为自己本质上是理想主义者，就像几代之后的达奇·舒尔茨、“双枪”克劳利、艾尔·卡彭和很多其他犯罪集团的“教父”们一样。实际上，你遇到的所有人都把自己看得很崇高，希望自己有好的名声，大公无私。

J．皮尔庞特·摩根在分析这个问题的时候发现，人们做事时通常有两个理由：好听的理由和现实的理由。

当事人一定会想着现实理由，这是毋庸置疑的。然而我们其他人，作为一个本质上的理想主义者，都喜欢那些好听的理由。所以若想改变别人，请触动对方高尚的动机。

这在商业中是否太过不切实际？让我们用宾夕法尼亚州格兰诺登市法瑞尔·米切尔公司的哈密尔顿·J．法瑞尔的例子检验一下。法瑞尔先生有一个很讨厌的房客，威胁要搬走，而离合同截止日期还有四个月，可是这个人依然不顾合同条例通知房东他要立刻搬家。

“这些人整个冬天都住在我的房子里，在全年最贵的季节。”法瑞尔先生向我们讲道，“而我知道在秋天前很难把房子租出去，我想到本该进账的租金打了水漂。相信我，这样下去我会破产的。

“通常我会强烈谴责房客，让他好好读合同。我会指出如果他要搬家就要一次性付给我所有合同范围内的租金，而我会采取一切办法收回这些租金，我会这样做也能做得到。

“然而我不希望上演如此戏剧性的场景，我决定试试其他方法。所以我是这样开始跟他交谈的：‘先生，我听说了你的事，现在依然觉得不可思议。我出租房子那么多年了，看得多了便也会看人了。我一直觉得你是个说话算话的人。实际上我依然坚信这一点，所以我想赌一把。

“‘这是我的提议。请你再仔细考虑一下搬家这件事。如果下个月你告诉我你还想搬家，那么我答应你，我会接受你的搬家要求，然后承认自己看人的眼光有问题。然而我相信你是个说话算话的人，会履行我们之间的合同。说到底，文明还是野蛮，这都是自己的选择。’

“当第二个月来临时，这位先生来见我，亲自把租金拿给了我。他说他和他的妻子重新考虑了搬家的事，他们决定留下，遵守合同才是唯一体面的方式。”

当已故的罗德·诺斯克利夫生前在报纸上看到了自己的一张不愿公开的照片时，他给报社编辑写了一封信。他说“别登我不喜欢的照片”了吗？没有。他希望触动对方的高尚动机，他运用的是我们每个人对母亲的尊重和爱戴。他写道：“恳请您不要再刊登那张照片了，我妈妈很不喜欢它。”

当小约翰·D．洛克菲勒希望报纸停止刊登他孩子的照片时，他也试图触动对方的高尚动机。他并没有说：“我不希望你们刊登这些照片。”他触动的是我们每个人内心深处的渴求——避免对孩子造成伤害。他说：“你也懂的，朋友们，你们中有些人也有孩子，你知道小孩子得到太多公开关注不是一件好事。”

当《周六晚报》和《妇女家庭杂志》的拥有者赛勒斯·H．K．科蒂斯刚刚开始创业时，他还是缅因州的一个穷苦男孩，他没有像其他报社、杂志社一样拥有足够的钱支付给投稿者，他雇不起一流的作者为赚取利益而写作。所以他要触动作者的高尚动机。比如说，他竟然说服了《小妇人》的作者路易莎·梅·阿尔科特在职业巅峰期为他写文章，他并没说要给她寄一百美金的支票，而是说会寄支票给阿尔科特喜欢的慈善组织。

或许读到这里，怀疑论者会说：“哦，这一套只对诺斯克利夫、洛克菲勒或是多愁善感的小说家管用。我希望你能展示给我看，这对于欠我债需要我去收的那些顽劣家伙也适用。”

或许你是对的。没什么是万能药，不可能在每个情形中，对每种人都奏效。如果你对自己的处事方式满意，那为什么要变？如果不满意，为何不试试呢？

不论如何，我觉得你会喜欢下面这个故事。这是我以前的一个学生，詹姆斯·L．托马斯讲的：

某个汽车公司的六名客户拒绝付维修费，他们并不是拒付全部费用，而都是说其中的某一项款额不能付。他们每一个人都在维修单上签了名，所以公司确定款额没有错，而他们也是这样说的。这是他们犯的第一个错误。

信用部门用了下述方式试图讨回到期未付的款额。你猜猜他们会不会成功？

他们打电话直接说对方欠款，而他们打电话的目的就是来收款的。

他们直接说，公司绝对没有出错，在任何情形下征收这些款项都是合理的。这也就是说顾客绝对是错的，在任何情况下拒付款项都是不合理的。

他们说，公司不管怎样都比顾客对汽车的了解要全面，所以没有争论的必要。

结果，他们开始争论起来。

这里有任何安抚客户情绪并清账的方式吗？答案很明显。

在这个阶段里，信用部经理都快要和客户开战了，他用法律条文一条条向客户开火，还好这时总经理注意到此事。经理调查了这几个人，发现他们并没有赖账的名声，所以一定是公司出了问题，公司的收款方式出了问题。于是他打电话给詹姆斯·L．托马斯，让他去收这些糊涂账。

托马斯先生是这样做的：

“我拜访了每一位客户，试图通过确认正确的账单收回糊涂账。但是关于这点我只字未提。我解释说我来的目的是为了找出公司到底哪里出了错。

“我说得很明白，我会不带偏见地聆听顾客的说法。我告诉他们公司从未认定自己是无懈可击的。

“我告诉客户我只是对他的车感兴趣，而他对自己的车的了解才是无人可比的，他才是这件事上的权威。

“我让对方说话，而我带着他所期待的兴趣和同情心听着一切。

“最后，当客户的情绪稳定下来后，我用对方认为公平的方式与他对话，我试着触动他高尚的动机。我说：‘首先，我希望您知道我也觉得在这件事上公司一直处理不当。我们的一位代表使您反感和动怒，给您带来了不便。这真不应该发生。我非常抱歉，我代表公司向你道歉。我在这儿听您讲述时就觉得您是个讲理又耐心的人，而因为您讲理又耐心，我请求您为我做一件事，您比任何人都适合做这件事。这里是您的账单，我知道我来调整它是保险的，如果您是我们公司的总裁也会有同样的决定。但是我想让您亲自来决定付多少钱。您说了算。’

“顾客调整了账单吗？当然，他们调整得可尽兴了。这些账单从一百五十到四百美金不等。有客户做出了最利己的决定吗？是的，有一个人一分钱都不肯付。而其余五人则付了大部分金额。而更妙的是，接下来的两年里，这六个人都又从我们这儿买了新车！

“经验告诉我，”托马斯先生说，“当我们无法足够了解客户的背景时，最牢靠的方法便是设定他们是诚恳、诚实、真诚的人，一旦被说服，他们便会主动支付账单。换一种更清楚的说法，那就是：人们是诚实的，愿意履行责任，这方面的特例很少。而且我确信，面对一个有欺骗倾向的人时，如果你让对方感受到你认为他诚实、正直、公正，那么他就会做出相应的行为。”




触动对方的高尚动机。





第十八章　如何批评而不招致怨恨


一天中午，查尔斯·施瓦布在视察他的一个钢铁厂时发现有员工在吸烟。而在他们头上，就顶着“请勿吸烟”的标示。施瓦布是否走过去指着标示问他们“你认字吗”？哦，不。施瓦布不会这样做。他走过去，给每人递上一根雪茄，说：“伙计们，到外面去抽我会很感激的。”他们都知道自己违反了规定，他们知道施瓦布也知道这点，然而施瓦布不但没有责骂他们，还给了他们小礼物，这让他们感受到自己的重要性。因此，他们爱戴施瓦布。谁都爱这样的人，不是吗？

约翰·沃纳梅克也运用了同样的技巧。沃纳梅克曾每天都去他费城的店里走一圈。有一次，他看到一位顾客在柜台旁等了半天也没人招呼她。服务员呢？哦，他们正围成一圈在柜台另一边谈笑风生呢。沃纳梅克什么也没说，自己走进柜台帮助女人结了账，并把货物递给售货员进行包装。

选民常抱怨无法接近公职人员。公职人员的确都是大忙人，不过有时却是那些过度保护官员的助手的错误，他们不希望官员被过多访客所扰。迪士尼所在的佛罗里达奥兰多市的市长卡尔·朗弗德时常告诫属下要允许访客见他。他宣称自己执行的是“开门”政策，然而当社区市民打来电话时，他们却被秘书和其他行政人员拒之门外。

最后市长找到了方法，他把办公室的门卸了下来！他的助手终于懂了。在那个颇具象征性的没有门的日子之后，他才真正做到了公开执政。

措辞的改变便是能否改变对方观点且不冒犯、不引起愤恨的关键。

很多人在提出批评前都会先赞美，然后用“但是”一词转折。例如，想改变孩子学习时粗心的毛病时，我们会说：“约翰，我们很为你骄傲，但是如果你能在代数上更加努力，你会做得更好。”

在这个例子中，约翰在听到“但是”二字前都备受鼓舞。但听到这个词后，他会怀疑赞美的真诚度。对他来说，赞美或许只是虚伪的开头，目的是批判并影射他的失败。家长会失去信誉，也不太可能改变约翰的学习态度。

这是很容易改变的一件事。你只需把“但是”变成“还有”。例如，“约翰，你这学期成绩进步了，我们很为你骄傲。还有，如果下学期你能继续用功，你的代数一定会和其他科目一样好的。”

现在约翰可以接受赞美了，因为后面没有跟着影射失败的词语。我们间接地让他注意到可以进步的方面，他很有可能会试着不辜负我们的期待。

那些敏感的人有可能对直接批判产生怨恨，这个时候，间接地让对方注意到自己的问题对这些人来说尤其适用。罗德岛温索基特的马姬·雅各布在训练班中告诉了我们，她是如何说服邋遢的建筑工人在加盖房屋后清理现场的。

刚开始施工的几天里，雅各布女士每次下班回家都会发现院子里堆满了木材碎块。她不想惹恼工人，因为他们的手艺非常好，所以工人回家后，她和她的孩子们会把碎块都捡起来堆在一边。后来的一个早晨，她把工头拉到一边说：“昨天你们把前院收拾得特别干净整齐，不会让邻居不满。”从那以后，工人都会把碎木整齐地堆到一边，而且工头每天都会来询问雅各布女士对院子每晚的状况是否满意。

陆军预备队的成员和他们的教官间最大的矛盾之一便是理发。预备队成员认为自己是平民（多数情况下的确如此），不愿意把头发剪得太短。

预备队第542学校的军士长哈利·凯瑟尔在训练一组未任命的预备军时也遇到了这个问题。大家以为他会大声责骂并吓唬这些人，然而他选择了另一种方式，间接表述观点。

他说：“先生们，你们都是领导者。如果你们都能以身作则就会事半功倍。你们必须当属下的好榜样。你们知道军规对发型的要求是什么，尽管我的头发已经比你们有的人短了，但我今天要去理发。你对着镜子看看，如果觉得理了发才能起到更好的表率作用，我们会为你安排理发时间。”

结果可想而知。有些人的确照了镜子，当天下午就去理了个大兵头。第二天早晨，凯瑟尔军士长说他已经看到了一些成员展现出的领导气质。

1887年3月8日，德高望重的牧师亨利·沃德·比奇去世了。之后的那个周日，莱曼·艾伯特被邀请在比奇留下的空讲道台上讲话。他希望做到最好，所以一遍又一遍地写布道词并进行润色，像福楼拜一样认真。写完后他读给妻子听，就如大多数演讲稿一样，它很糟糕。如果他妻子略微缺乏深思熟虑便会说：“莱曼，这真是太糟糕了。这行不通的。大家都会睡着的。听上去你就像在读百科全书。布道那么多年了，你应该能说得更好啊。老天啊，你为什么不能说人话呢？为什么不自然一些？如果你真在众人面前读了这些那真是会给你自己蒙羞啊。”

这是她有可能说出的话。如果真的说了，你知道后果会是怎样的，她也知道。所以她只是轻描淡写了一句：这听上去像是一篇《北美评论》上的出色文章。换言之，她赞美了这篇文章，同时巧妙地暗示了它并不适合演讲。莱曼·艾伯特明白她的意思，把精心准备的稿子撕掉，后来进行了脱稿演讲。




纠正他人错误的有效方式是：

间接让对方意识到自己的问题。





第十九章　先承认你自己的错误


我的外甥女约瑟芬·卡耐基到纽约来当我的秘书。她19岁，三年前高中毕业。她对商务的了解少得可怜，但后来她成了我最得力的秘书，然而在一开始的时候，她……总之，进步空间还很大。

有一天我想批评她时，我忽然对自己说：“等一下，戴尔·卡耐基。你的年龄是她的两倍，商务经验是她的一万倍，你怎能期望她具有你的观点、你的判断力和你的动力呢（当然也都是很平庸的了）？再等等，戴尔，你十九岁时在做什么？你还记得那些愚蠢的错误和莽撞吗？还记得你做过这样和那样的蠢事吗？”

诚实、公平地思考过这些问题后，我认为十九岁的约瑟芬比十九岁时的我能力更强。而我羞愧地承认——这对于约瑟芬来讲并不算是什么褒奖。

所以从那以后，每当我想让约瑟芬意识到错误时都会这样开始对话：“约瑟芬，你犯了错，不过老天知道这比我犯过的错轻多了。没有人生来就有好的判断力。只有经验才能让你成长，而你已经比我在你这个年龄时做得好多了。我自己做过很多愚蠢的事，所以我没有批评你的意思。但是你难道不认为这件事应该这样去做吗？”

如果批评你的人首先谦虚地承认了自己的不完美，那么听他讲你的缺点时是否就没那么难以接受了？

加拿大马尼托巴布兰登的工程师E．G．迪利斯通对秘书很不满意，他口述的信打出来后每页都有两三个拼写错误。迪利斯通先生讲了他是这样处理这件事的：

“就像很多工程师一样，我们不以卓越的英文水准和精确的拼写著称，几年来我都在用带有字母检索的小本子记录容易拼错的词。很明显，直接指出问题无法让我的秘书更仔细地检查或更多地翻阅字典，我决定换一种方式。所以，当我再次接到错误百出的信时，我和秘书一同坐下，并跟她说：

“‘不知为何，这个字看起来不对。这是我一直拼错的一个词。因此我把它写在我的拼写小本子上（然后我翻到相应的一页）。你看，拼错的词就在这儿。我现在对拼写特别敏感，因为人们的确会通过信件来评判一个人，而拼写错误会使我们显得没有职业精神。’

“我不知道她是否学习了我的方式，但从那次谈话以后，她的拼写错误率大幅度地降低了。”

1909年，做事谨慎的伯恩哈德·冯·比洛亲王就认识到这样做的重要性，那时的冯·比洛是德意志帝国总理，那时的国王是威廉二世，就是那个自大、傲慢的最后的恺撒。他正在建立陆军和海军军队并对他们的实力夸下海口。

后来发生了一件令人震惊的事。皇帝说了一些话，一些令人难以置信的话，震惊了全国乃至全世界。雪上加霜的是，皇帝又当众做出了愚蠢而傲慢的宣告。他在访问英国时发表了这些言论，还授予了《每日电讯报》合法的权利来刊登这些话。例如他声称自己是全德国唯一一个对英国有友好感情的人；他正在组建一支海军来抵抗日本的威胁；是他单枪匹马地把英国从俄国和法国的屈辱中解救出来；也是他的方案才使英国的罗伯茨勋爵击败了南非布尔人；等等。

在几百年的和平时期里，从来没有一个欧洲君主说过这样惊人的话，这在整个大陆引起了轩然大波。英国被激怒了，德国政治家惊呆了。而在这一片惊愕中，皇帝也惊慌失措了，他让总理冯·比洛替自己承担责任。没错，他希望冯·比洛宣布这都是他的责任，是他教皇帝说的这些惊人的话。

“但是陛下，”冯·比洛说，“德国或英国没有人会相信我有影响陛下您这样发言的能力啊。”

这话刚说出口，冯·比洛就意识到自己犯了严重的错误，皇帝爆发了。

他大喊道：“你认为我就是个傻瓜，犯了你永远不可能犯下的鲁莽错误。”

冯·比洛知道他本该先赞美再批评的，但是事已至此，他只能做力所能及的补救。他在批评后进行了赞美，这创造了奇迹。

“我完全不是这个意思。”他充满敬意地回答，“陛下在很多方面都比我优秀很多，当然不止在军事方面，在自然科学中也是如此。陛下每次给我讲解气压表、无线电话或伦琴射线时，我都充满了敬仰之情。我很羞愧，我对于自然科学的一切一窍不通，也没有任何关于物理、化学的常识，连很简单的自然现象都不会解释。但是，作为弥补，我还是知道一些历史知识和政治，尤其是外交手段的。”

皇帝露出了笑容，冯·比洛赞美了他，冯·比洛抬高了他而贬低了自己，皇帝因此原谅了他之前所说的一切。他兴高采烈地大声说：“我不是早就说过，咱们俩真是互补啊！我们应该在一起永不分离！一定会的！”

他和冯·比洛握手，不是一下而是很多下。那天晚上，他兴致高涨，竟然握紧双拳说：“谁要是敢跟我说冯·比洛亲王的坏话，我就一拳打到他的鼻子上！”

冯·比洛及时挽救了自己，但是身为谨慎的外交家他也犯了错误：他应该一开始就讲自己的缺陷和威廉的优点，而不是影射皇帝是个需要保护的笨蛋。

如果几句对对方的赞美和对自己的贬低就能使如此自大并认为自己受到侮辱的恺撒转变成忠实朋友，那么，如果我们在日常生活中运用这样的方式又将带来多大的影响！使用正确，它会为人际关系带来真正的奇迹。

承认自己的错误，哪怕是还未改正的错误，都能说服对方改变自己的行为。最近，马里兰蒂莫尼姆的克莱伦斯·泽尔胡森证明了这一点。那时他发现十五岁的儿子开始抽烟。

“当然我不希望大卫抽烟。”泽尔胡森先生说，“但是我和他母亲都抽烟，我们一直都是坏榜样。我向大卫解释我是如何在他的年龄就开始抽烟，尼古丁是如何侵蚀了我，而事到如今我已经很难戒烟了。我提醒他，我的咳嗽是多么惹人厌，而且几年前他还曾让我戒烟。

“我没有劝他、逼迫他戒烟，或警告他吸烟的诸多危害。我只是指出了我是如何染上烟瘾的以及它对我的不良影响。

“他想了一阵子，决定大学之前都不再吸烟。几年过去了，大卫再也没有吸过烟，也不再想吸烟。

“那次谈话后，我自己也决定戒烟了。在家人的帮助下，我也做到了。”




一位好的领导者会遵循下面的准则：

批评他人前先谈论自己的错误。





第二十章　没人喜欢被指使


我曾有幸与美国资深传记作家艾达·塔贝尔一同进餐。当我告诉她我正在写这样一本书后，我们便开始讨论待人接物时最重要的一点。她告诉我，她在写欧文·D．扬的传记时曾经访问过一个与扬先生在同一个办公室共事三年的人。这个人说，他从来也没听过扬先生直接给任何人下命令。他总是提出建议，而非命令。例如，欧文·D．扬从来不会说：“做这件事”“做那件事”“别这样做”“别那样做”。他会说：“你或许可以考虑这样做”或者“你觉得这样可行吗”。当他口述完一封信后，总是会说：“你觉得可以吗？”在审读助手写的信时，他会说：“或许如果我们重新措辞会更好。”他总是给人做事的主动权，从不指使助手做这做那，他放手让他们自己做事并从错误中学习。

这样的方式会使他人更容易改正错误。这样的方式保护了他人的自尊，能使他人感觉到自己的重要性。这促进了合作，减少了反抗。

粗暴的命令所引发的怨恨是长久的，即便命令是为了改善明显糟糕的情况。宾夕法尼亚州怀俄明一所技校的老师丹·桑塔莱利在班里讲了他的一个学生违规停车挡住学校里一家店入口的事。一位讲师冲了进来，用傲慢的口吻问：“谁的车挡住了通道？”当那个学生回应后，那个老师大喊：“把车开走！现在！要不然我用链子把它缠上然后拖走！”

那个学生固然做错了，不能把车停在那里。但从此以后，不仅那个学生厌恶那位老师的举动，所有学生都开始在他的班上捣乱，令他头疼。

他还能采取什么其他的方式吗？如果他友好地问“哪位同学把车停在过道上了”，然后建议那位同学把车移走，让其他车可以出入，学生会很乐意移车的。那个同学和其他同学都不会生气，也不会厌恶那个老师。

问问题的方式不仅能使命令更易被接受，还往往能激发对方的创造力。人们在认为自己参与了决定时会更乐意接受命令。

当南非约翰内斯堡的精密部件小工厂总经理伊恩·麦当劳接到一笔庞大订单时，他很确定他们无法如期交货。工厂里的工作早已安排好，而这笔订单交货时间之紧迫使按时交货都成了几乎不可能的任务。

伊恩并没有催促员工加快速度赶订单。他召集了全厂会议，向大家解释了情况，告诉他们如果能按时交货对公司来说将具有多重大的意义。然后他开始问问题：

“我们能用什么办法来处理这个订单？”

“有没有人能想到任何不同的操作方式以保证我们能按时交货？”

“我们该怎样调整工作时间和任务分配？”

职员们想出了很多主意，执意让经理接这笔订单。他们用“我们能做到”的态度来迎接这个问题。于是他接受了订单，开始生产，并且如期交货。




高效领导者会：

提出问题而不是直接下命令。





第二十一章　给别人留个面子


几年前通用电气公司面临着一个棘手的问题——撤回查尔斯·斯坦梅茨部门负责人的职位。斯坦梅茨这个电力方面一等一的天才，在当计算部门负责人这件事上却很失败。然而公司不敢直接冒犯他，他是公司不可或缺的人才，也有一颗非常敏感的心。所以他们送给了他一个新的头衔——通用电气公司工程师顾问。这是新的名称，旧的职责，但他将不再领导整个部门。

斯坦梅茨欣然接受了。

通用公司的其他官员也都很开心，他们温柔地操纵了最喜怒无常的明星。因为他们保住了斯坦梅茨的面子，所以没有引起轩然大波。

让对方保住面子！这很重要！非常重要！而想到这点的人却如此之少！我们残暴地践踏着别人的感情，从而达到自己的目的。我们在公开场合对孩子或员工挑错、威胁和批评，完全不顾及对方的尊严。多考虑几分钟，多说几个体贴的词汇，真正去了解对方的态度，则能把刺激降到最低！

下次当我们需要解雇或斥责一个员工时，请记住这一点。

“解雇员工并不好玩。被解雇更不好玩。”我引用的是注册会计师马歇尔·A．格兰杰写给我的信中所说的话。“我们的生意大多是季度性的。所以当报税季度过后，我们就要让很多员工离职。

“我们行业有句俗话：没人喜欢抡斧头。因此习惯性做法便是让这个过程越短越好。通常人们会这样说：‘请坐，史密斯先生。这个季度结束了，我们没什么工作能让你做了。当然你也知道我们只是为了忙季而雇佣你的，等等。’

“这些人会感觉失望、被辜负。这些人中的大多数一生都在做会计，而对任何一家轻易放弃他们的事务所都不会有特殊的感情。

“最近我决定用更有技巧、更加体谅的方式解雇这些季度员工。我给每个人打电话前都仔细回想了他在冬天里的工作。我说了以下类似的话：‘史密斯先生，你的表现很突出（如果是实情的话）。我们让你去纽瓦克出差的那次任务很艰巨，你的压力很大，但你完成得格外出色。我希望你知道，公司以你为荣，你具备好的素质，不论到哪工作都会前途无量。我们公司相信你的实力并会一直为你加油，我们希望你不要忘了这点。’

“结果呢？那些人离职时感觉好多了。他们没有被辜负的感觉。他们知道如果我们有足够工作来分配就会留住他们。而当我们日后需要他们时，他们会带着亲切感回来。”

在培训班的一堂课中，两个学生讨论了指责带来的负面影响和挽回他人面子所带来的正面影响。

宾夕法尼亚州哈里斯堡的弗莱德·克拉克说起了他公司的一件事：“在我们的一次生产会议上，一位副总就生产环节的问题向生产主管提出了尖锐的问题。他的语气充满攻击性，意图便是指出主管所犯的错误。这位主管不想在众人面前丢脸，所以回答得很含糊其辞。这使副总大发雷霆，责骂了主管还指责他说谎。

“任何因工作往来而形成的微弱关系都在瞬间被摧毁了。这位总体表现不错的主管从此以后再也没有做出过什么业绩。几个月后他辞职投奔了我们的竞争对手，而我知道他在那里表现得非常出色。”

另一个学生安娜·马佐尼想起在自己的工作岗位上也发生过类似的事，然而不同的处理方式带来了不同的结局！马佐尼小姐是食品包装公司的市场专员。那时，公司第一次让她完成重要的任务——新产品的市场测试。她告诉大家：“我拿到测试结果后快要崩溃了。我的计划出了严重错误，整个测试都要重做一遍。更糟糕的是，我在需要开会回报结果之前没有机会向老板做出解释。

“当他们让我做报告时，我吓得直发抖。我做了一切防止自己临场崩溃的事，下决心一定不能哭。不能让那些男人认为女人太情绪化所以无法完成某些工作。我简单地做了汇报并解释了测试中的错误，跟大家说我会在下次会议之前重新测试。我坐下，等待着老板大发雷霆。

“出乎意料的是，他感谢了我的工作并说在接手新项目时出错是很常见的事，还说他相信我下一次测试会得到准确、有意义的信息。他在全体员工面前向我保证，他对我有信心，他知道我尽力了，而且导致任务失败的不是能力的缺乏而是经验的缺乏。

“散会时，我昂首挺胸走了出去，下定决心再也不会让老板失望。”

即便我们是正确的、对方是绝对错误的，令对方丢脸只会摧毁对方的自尊心。法国传奇的飞行先锋和作家圣-埃克絮佩里写道：“我无权去说或去做任何剥夺他人自尊的事。我怎么看他不重要，他怎么看自己才是最重要的。伤害他人的尊严是犯罪。”




一个真正的领导者会：

让他人保住面子。





HOW TO ENJOY YOUR LIFE AND YOUR JOB

Dale Carnegie





Part One　Cultivate a Mental Attitude That Will Bring You Peace and Happiness





Chapter 1　What Makes You Tired—and What You Can Do about It


Here is an astounding and significant fact: Mental work alone can't make you tired. Sounds absurd. But a few years ago, scientists tried to find out how long the human brain could labour without reaching“a diminished capacity for work”, the scientific definition of fatigue. To the amazement of these scientists, they discovered that blood passing through the brain, when it is active, shows no fatigue at all! If you took blood from the veins of a day labourer while he was working, you would find it full of“fatigue toxins”and fatigue products. But if you took a drop of blood from the brain of an Albert Einstein, it would show no fatigue toxins whatever at the end of the day.

So far as the brain is concerned, it can work“as well and as swiftly at the end of eight or even twelve hours of effort as at the beginning”. The brain is utterly tireless.... So what makes you tired? Psychiatrists declare that most of our fatigue derives from our mental and emotional attitudes. One of England's most distinguished psychiatrists, J. A. Hadfield, says in his book The Psychology of Power:“the greater part of the fatigue from which we suffer is of mental origin; in fact exhaustion of purely physical origin is rare.”

One of America's most distinguished psychiatrists, Dr. A. A. Brill, goes even further. He declares:“One hundred percent of the fatigue of the sedentary worker in good health is due to psychological factors, by which we mean emotional factors.”

What kinds of emotional factors tire the sedentary (or sitting) worker? Joy? Contentment? No! Never! Boredom, resentment, a feeling of not being appreciated, a feeling of futility, hurry, anxiety, worry—those are the emotional factors that exhaust the sitting worker, make him susceptible to colds, reduce his output, and send him home with a nervous headache. Yes, we get tired because our emotions produce nervous tensions in the body.

The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company pointed that out in a leaflet on fatigue:“Hard work by itself,”says this great life-insurance company,“seldom causes fatigue which cannot be cured by a good sleep or rest. ...Worry, tenseness, and emotional upsets are three of the biggest causes of fatigue. Often they are to blame when physical or mental work seems to be the cause. ... Remember that a tense muscle is a working muscle. Ease up! Save energy for important duties.”

Stop now, right where you are, and give yourself a check-up. As you read these lines, are you scowling at the book? Do you feel a strain between the eyes? Are you sitting relaxed in your chair? Or are you hunching up your shoulders? Are the muscles of your face tense? Unless your entire body is as limp and relaxed as an old rag doll, you are at this very moment producing nervous tensions and muscular tensions. You are producing nervous tensions and nervous fatigue!

Why do we produce these unnecessary tensions in doing mental work? Josselyn says:“I find that the chief obstacle ... is the almost universal belief that hard work requires a feeling of effort, else it is not well done.”So we scowl when we concentrate. We hunch up our shoulders. We call on our muscles to make the motion of effort, which in no way assists our brain in its work.

Here is an astonishing and tragic truth: millions of people who wouldn't dream of wasting dollars go right on wasting and squandering their energy with the recklessness of seven drunken sailors in Singapore.

What is the answer to this nervous fatigue? Relax! Relax! Relax! Learn to relax while you are doing your work!

Easy? No. You will probably have to reverse the habits of a lifetime. But it is worth the effort, for it may revolutionise your life! William James said, in his essay The Gospel of Relaxation:“The American over-tension and jerkiness and breathlessness and intensity and agony of expression ... are bad habits, nothing more or less.”Tension is a habit. Relaxing is a habit. And bad habits can be broken, good habits formed.

How do you relax? Do you start with your mind, or do you start with your nerves? You don't start with either. You always begin to relax with your muscles!

Let's give it a try. To show how it is done, suppose we start with your eyes. Read this paragraph through, and when you've reached the end, lean back, close your eyes, and say to your eyes silently:“Let go. Let go. Stop straining, stop frowning. Let go. Let go.”Repeat that over and over very slowly for a minute. ...

Didn't you notice that after a few seconds the muscles of the eyes began to obey? Didn't you feel as though some hand had wiped away the tension? Well, incredible as it seems, you have sampled in that one minute the whole key and secret to the art of relaxing. You can do the same thing with the jaw, with the muscles of the face, with the neck, with the shoulders, the whole of the body. But the most important organ of all is the eye. Dr. Edmund Jacobson of the University of Chicago has gone so far as to say that if you can completely relax the muscles of the eyes, you can forget all your troubles! The reason the eyes are so important in relieving nervous tension is that they burn up one-fourth of all the nervous energies consumed by the body. That is also why so many people with perfectly sound vision suffer from“eyestrain”. They are tensing the eyes.

Vicki Baum, the famous novelist, says that when she was a child, she met an old man who taught her one of the most important lessons she ever learned. She had fallen down and cut her knees and hurt her wrist. The old man picked her up; he had once been a circus clown; and, as he brushed her off, he said:“The reason you injured yourself was because you don't know how to relax. You have to pretend you are as limp as a sock, as an old crumpled sock. Come, I'll show you how to do it.”

That old man taught Vicki Baum and the other children how to fall, how to do flip-flops, and how to turn somersaults. And always he insisted:“Think of yourself as an old crumpled sock. Then you've got to relax!”

You can relax in odd moments, almost anywhere you are. Only don't make an effort to relax. Relaxation is the absence of all tension and effort. Think ease and relaxation. Begin by thinking relaxation of the muscles of your eyes and your face, saying over and over:“Let go... let go... let go and relax.”Feel the energy flowing out of your facial muscles to the centre of your body. Think of yourself as free from tension as a baby.

That is what Galli-Curci, the great soprano, used to do. Helen Jepson told me that she used to see Galli-Curci before a performance, sitting in a chair with all her muscles relaxed and her lower jaw so limp it actually sagged. An excellent practice—it kept her from becoming too nervous before her stage entrance; it prevented fatigue.

Here are five suggestions that will help you learn to relax:

1. Read one of the best books ever written on this subject: Release from Nervous Tension, by Dr. David Harold Fink.

2. Relax in odd moments. Let your body go limp like an old sock. I keep an old, maroon-coloured sock on my desk as I work— keep it there as a reminder of how limp I ought to be. If you haven't got a sock, a cat will do. Did you ever pick up a kitten sleeping in the sunshine? If so, both ends sagged like a wet newspaper. Even the yogis in India say that if you want to master the art of relaxation, study the cat. I never saw a tired cat, a cat with a nervous breakdown, or a cat suffering from insomnia, worry, or stomach ulcers. You will probably avoid these disasters if you learn to relax as the cat does.

3. Work, as much as possible, in a comfortable position. Remember that tensions in the body produce aching shoulders and nervous fatigue.

4. Check yourself four or five times a day, and say to yourself:“Am I making my work harder than it actually is? Am I using muscles that have nothing to do with the work I am doing?”This will help you form the habit of relaxing, and as Dr. David Harold Fink says:“Among those who know psychology best, it is habits two to one.”

5. Test yourself again at the end of the day, by asking yourself:“Just how tired am I? If I am tired, it is not because of the mental work I have done but because of the way I have done it.”“I measure my accomplishments,”says Daniel W. Josselyn,“not by how tired I am at the end of the day, but how tired I am not.”He says:“When I feel particularly tired at the end of the day, or when irritability proves that my nerves are tired, I know beyond question that it has been an inefficient day both as to quantity and quality.”If every business man would learn that same lesson, the death rate from“hypertension”diseases would drop overnight. And we would stop filling up our sanatoriums and asylums with men who have been broken by fatigue and worry.





Chapter 2　How to Banish the Boredom That Produces Fatigue, Worry, and Resentment


One of the chief causes of fatigue is boredom. To illustrate, let's take the case of Alice, a stenographer who lives on your street. Alice came home one night utterly exhausted. She acted fatigued. She was fatigued. She had a headache. She had a backache. She was so exhausted she wanted to go to bed without waiting for dinner. Her mother pleaded. ... She sat down at the table. The telephone rang. The boy friend! An invitation to a dance! Her eyes sparkled. Her spirits soared. She rushed upstairs, put on her Alice-blue gown, and danced until three o'clock in the morning; and when she finally did get home, she was not the slightest bit exhausted. She was, in fact, so exhilarated she couldn't fall asleep.

Was Alice really and honestly tired eight hours earlier, when she looked and acted exhausted? Sure she was. She was exhausted because she was bored with her work, perhaps bored with life. There are millions of Alices. You may be one of them.

It is a well-known fact that your emotional attitude usually has far more to do with producing fatigue than has physical exertion. A few years ago, Joseph E. Barmack, Ph.D., published in the Archives of Psychology a report of some of his experiments showing how boredom produces fatigue. Dr. Barmack put a group of students through a series of tests in which, he knew, they could have little interest. The result? The students felt tired and sleepy, complained of headaches and eyestrain, felt irritable. In some cases, even their stomachs were upset. Was it all“imagination”? No. Metabolism tests were taken of these students. These tests showed that the blood pressure of the body and the consumption of oxygen actually decrease when a person is bored, and that the whole metabolism picks up immediately as soon as he begins to feel interest and pleasure in his work!

We rarely get tired when we are doing something interesting and exciting. For example, I recently took a vacation in the Canadian Rockies up around Lake Louise. I spent several days trout fishing along Corral Creek, fighting my way through brush higher than my head, stumbling over logs, struggling through fallen timber—yet after eight hours of this, I was not exhausted. Why? Because I was excited, exhilarated. I had a sense of high achievement: six cut-throat trout. But suppose I had been bored by fishing, then how do you think I would have felt? I would have been worn out by such strenuous work at an altitude of seven thousand feet.

Even in such exhausting activities as mountain climbing, boredom may tire you far more than the strenuous work involved. For example, Mr. S. H. Kingman, president of the Farmers and Mechanics Savings Bank of Minneapolis, told me of an incident that is a perfect illustration of that statement. In July, 1943, the Canadian government asked the Canadian Alpine Club to furnish guides to train the members of the Prince of Wales Rangers in mountain climbing. Mr. Kingman was one of the guides chosen to train these soldiers. He told me how he and the other guides-men ranging from forty-two to fifty-nine years of age—took these young army men on long hikes across glaciers and snow fields and up a sheer cliff of forty feet, where they had to climb with ropes and tiny foot-holds and precarious hand-holds. They climbed Michael's Peak, the Vice-President Peak, and other unnamed peaks in the Little Yoho Valley in the Canadian Rockies. After fifteen hours of mountain climbing, these young men, who were in the pink of condition (they had just finished a six-week course in tough Commando training), were utterly exhausted.

Was their fatigue caused by using muscles that had not been hardened by Commando training? Any man who had ever been through Commando training would hoot at such a ridiculous question! No, they were utterly exhausted because they were bored by mountain climbing. They were so tarred, that many of them fell asleep without waiting to eat. But the guidesmen who were two and three times as old as the soldiers—were they tired? Yes, but not exhausted. The guides ate dinner and stayed up for hours, talking about the day's experiences. They were not exhausted because they were interested.

When Dr. Edward Thorndike of Columbia was conducting experiments in fatigue, he kept young men awake for almost a week by keeping them constantly interested. After much investigation, Dr. Thorndike is reported to have said:“Boredom is the only real cause of diminution of work.”

If you are a mental worker, it is seldom the amount of work you do that makes you tired. You may be tired by the amount of work you do not do. For example, remember the day last week when you were constantly interrupted. No letters answered. Appointments broken. Trouble here and there. Everything went wrong that day. You accomplished nothing whatever, yet you went home exhausted—and with a splitting head.

The next day everything clicked at the office. You accomplished forty times more than you did the previous day. Yet you went home fresh as a snowy-white gardenia. You have had that experience. So have I.

The lesson to be learned? Just this: our fatigue is often caused not by work, but by worry, frustration, and resentment.

While writing this chapter, I went to see a revival of Jerome Kern's delightful musical comedy, Show Boat. Captain Andy, captain of the Cotton Blossom, says, in one of his philosophical interludes:“The lucky folks are the ones that get to do the things they enjoy doing.”Such folks are lucky because they have more energy, more happiness, less worry, and less fatigue. Where your interests are, there is your energy also. Walking ten blocks with a nagging wife can be more fatiguing than walking ten miles with an adoring sweetheart.

And so what? What can you do about it? Well, here is what one stenographer did about it—a stenographer working for an oil company in Tulsa, Oklahoma. For several days each month, she had one of the dullest jobs imaginable: filling out printed forms for oil leases, inserting figures and statistics. This task was so boring that she resolved, in self-defence, to make it interesting. How? She had a daily contest with herself She counted the number of forms she filled out each morning, and then tried to excel that record in the afternoon. She counted each day's total and tried to better it the next day. Result? She was soon able to fill out more of these dull printed forms than any other stenographer in her division. And what did all this get her? Praise? No. ... Thanks? No. ... Promotion? No. ... Increased pay? No. ... But it did help to prevent the fatigue that is spawned by boredom. It did give her a mental stimulant. Because she had done her best to make a dull job interesting, she had more energy, more zest, and got far more happiness out of her leisure hours. I happen to know this story is true, because I married that girl.

Here is the story of another stenographer who found it paid to act as if her work were interesting. She used to fight her work. But no more. Her name is Miss Vallie G. Golden, and she lives at 473 South Kenilworth Avenue, Elmhurst, Illinois. Here is her story, as she wrote it to me:

“There are four stenographers in my office and each of us is assigned to take letters from several men. Once in a while we get jammed up in these assignments; and one day, when an assistant department head insisted that I do a long letter over, I started to rebel. I tried to point out to him that the letter could be corrected without being retyped—and he retorted that if I didn't do it over, he would find someone else who would! I was absolutely fuming! But as I started to retype this letter, it suddenly occurred to me that there were a lot of other people who would jump at the chance to do the work I was doing. Also, that I was being paid a salary to do just that work. I began to feel better. I suddenly made up my mind to do my work as if I actually enjoyed it—even though I despised it. Then I made this important discovery: if I do my work as if I really enjoy it, then I do enjoy it to some extent I also found I can work faster when I enjoy my work. So there is seldom any need now for me to work overtime. This new attitude of mine gained me the reputation of being a good worker. And when one of the department superintendents needed a private secretary, he asked for me for the job—because, he said, I was willing to do extra work without being sulky! This matter of the power of a changed mental attitude,”wrote Miss Golden,“has been a tremendously important discovery to me. It has worked wonders!”

Without perhaps being conscious of it. Miss Vallie Golden was using the famous“as if”philosophy. William James counseled us to act“as if”we were brave, and we would be brave; and to act“as if”we were happy, and we would be happy, and so on.

Act“as if”you were interested in your job, and that bit of acting will tend to make your interest real. It will also tend to decrease your fatigue, your tensions, and your worries.

A few years ago, Harlan A. Howard made a decision that completely altered his life. He resolved to make a dull job interesting—and he certainly had a dull one: washing plates, scrubbing counters, and dishing out ice-cream in the high-school lunch-room while the other boys were playing ball or kidding the girls. Harlan Howard despised his job—but since he had to stick to it, he resolved to study ice-cream how it was made, what ingredients were used, why some ice-creams were better than others. He studied the chemistry of ice-cream, and became a whiz in the high-school chemistry course. He was so interested now in food chemistry that he entered the Massachusetts State College and majored in the field of“food technology”. When the New York Cocoa Exchange offered a hundred-dollar prize for the best paper on uses of cocoa and chocolate—a prize open to all college students—who do you suppose won it? ... That's right. Harlan Howard.

When he found it difficult to get a job, he opened a private laboratory in the basement of his home at 750 North Pleasant Street, Amherst, Massachusetts. Shortly after that, a new law was passed. The bacteria in milk had to be counted. Harlan A. Howard was soon counting bacteria for the fourteen milk companies in Amherst—and he had to hire two assistants.

Where will he be twenty-five years from now? Well, the men who are now running the business of food chemistry will be retired then, or dead; and their places will be taken by young lads who are now radiating initiative and enthusiasm. Twenty-five years from now, Harlan A. Howard will probably be one of the leaders in his profession, while some of his classmates to whom he used to sell ice-cream over the counter will be sour, unemployed, cursing the government, and complaining that they never had a chance. Harlan A. Howard might never have had a chance, either, if he hadn't resolved to make a dull job interesting.

Years ago, there was another young man who was bored with his dull job of standing at a lathe, turning out bolts in a factory. His first name was Sam. Sam wanted to quit, but he was afraid he couldn't find another job. Since he had to do this dull work, Sam decided he would make it interesting. So he ran a race with the mechanic operating a machine beside him. One of them was to trim off the rough surfaces on his machine, and the other was to trim the bolts down to the proper diameter. They would switch machines occasionally and see who could turn out the most bolts. The foreman, impressed with Sam's speed and accuracy, soon gave him a better job. That was the start of a whole series of promotions. Thirty years later, Sam —Samuel Vauclain—was president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works. But he might have remained a mechanic all his life if he had not resolved to make a dull job interesting.

H. V. Kaltenborn—the famous radio news analyst—once told me how he made a dull job interesting. When he was twenty-two years old, he worked his way across the Atlantic on a cattle boat, feeding and watering the steers. After making a bicycle tour of England, he arrived in Paris, hungry and broke. Pawning his camera for five dollars, he put an ad. in the Paris edition of The New York Herald and got a job selling stereopticon machines. If you are forty years old, you may remember those old-fashioned stereoscopes that we used to hold up before our eyes to look at two pictures exactly alike. As we looked, a miracle happened. The two lenses in the stereoscope transformed the two pictures into a single scene with the effect of a third dimension. We saw distance. We got an astounding sense of perspective.

Well, as I was saying, Kaltenborn started out selling these machines from door to door in Paris—and he couldn't speak French. But he earned five thousand dollars in commissions the first year, and made himself one of the highest-paid salesmen in France that year. H.V. Kaltenborn told me that this experience did as much to develop within him the qualities that make for success as did any single year of study at Harvard. Confidence? He told me himself that after that experience, he felt he could have sold The Congressional Record to French housewives.

That experience gave him an intimate understanding of French life that later proved invaluable in interpreting, on the radio, European events.

How did he manage to become an expert salesman when he couldn't speak French? Well, he had his employer write out his sales talk in perfect French, and he memorised it. He would ring a door-bell, a housewife would answer, and Kaltenborn would begin repeating his memorised sales talk with an accent so terrible it was funny. He would show the housewife his pictures, and when she asked a question, he would shrug his shoulders and say:“An American... an American.”He would then take off his hat and point to a copy of the sales talk in perfect French that he had pasted in the top of his hat. The housewife would laugh, he would laugh—and show her more pictures. When H. V. Kaltenborn told me about this, he confessed that the job had been far from easy. He told me that there was only one quality that pulled him through: his determination to make the job interesting. Every morning before he started out, he looked into the mirror and gave himself a pep talk:“Kaltenborn, you have to do this if you want to eat. Since you have to do it—why not have a good time doing it? Why not imagine every time you ring a door-bell that you are an actor before the footlights and that there's an audience out there looking at you. After all, what you are doing is just as funny as something on the stage. So why not put a lot of zest and enthusiasm into it?”

Mr. Kaltenborn told me that these daily pep talks helped him transform a task that he had once hated and dreaded into an adventure that he liked and made highly profitable.When I asked Mr. Kaltenborn if he had any advice to give to the young men of America who are eager to succeed, he said:“Yes, go to bat with yourself every morning. We talk a lot about the importance of physical exercise to wake us up out of the half-sleep in which so many of us walk around. But we need, even more, some spiritual and mental exercises every morning to stir us into action. Give yourself a pep talk every day.”

Is giving yourself a pep talk every day silly, superficial, childish? No, on the contrary, it is the very essence of sound psychology.“Our life is what our thoughts make it.”Those words are just as true today as they were eighteen centuries ago when Marcus Aurelius first wrote them in his book of Meditations:“Our life is what our thoughts make it.”

By talking to yourself every hour of the day, you can direct yourself to think thoughts of courage and happiness, thoughts of power and peace. By talking to yourself about the things you have to be grateful for, you can fill your mind with thoughts that soar and sing.

By thinking the right thoughts, you can make any job less distasteful. Your boss wants you to be interested in your job so that he will make more money. But let's forget about what the boss wants. Think only of what getting interested in your job will do for you. Remind yourself that it may double the amount of happiness you get out of life, for you spend about one half of your waking hours at your work, and if you don't find happiness in your work, you may never find it anywhere. Keep reminding yourself that getting interested in your job will take your mind off your worries, and, in the long run, will probably bring promotion and increased pay. Even if it doesn't do that, it will reduce fatigue toa minimum and help you enjoy your hours of leisure.





Chapter 3　Four Good Working Habits That Will Help Prevent Fatigue and Worry


Good Working Habit No. 1: Clear Your Desk of All Papers Except Those Relating to the Immediate Problem at Hand.


Roland L. Williams, President of Chicago and North-western Railway, says:“A person with his desk piled high with papers on various matters will find his work much easier and more accurate if he clears that desk of all but the immediate problem on hand. I call this good housekeeping, and it is the numberone step towards efficiency.”

If you visit the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., you will find five words painted on the ceiling-five words written by the poet Pope:

“Order is Heaven's first law.”

Order ought to be the first law of business, too. But is it? No, the average business man's desk is cluttered up with papers that he hasn't looked at for weeks. In fact, the publisher of a New Orleans newspaper once told me that his secretary cleared up one of his desks and found a typewriter that had been missing for two years!

The mere sight of a desk littered with unanswered mail and reports and memos is enough to breed confusion, tension, and worries. It is much worse than that. The constant reminder of“a million things to do and no time to do them”can worry you not only into tension and fatigue, but it can also worry you into high blood pressure, heart trouble, and stomach ulcers.

Dr. John H. Stokes, professor, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, read a paper before the National Convention of the American Medical Association—a paper entitled“Functional Neuroses as Complications of Organic Disease”. In that paper, Dr. Stokes listed eleven conditions under the title:“What to Look for in the Patient's State of Mind”. Here is the first item on that list:

“The sense of must or obligation; the unending stretch of things ahead that simply have to be done.”

But how can such an elementary procedure as clearing your desk and making decisions help you avoid this high pressure, this sense of must, this sense of an“unending stretch of things ahead that simply have to be done”? Dr. William L. Sadler, the famous psychiatrist, tells of a patient who, by using this simple device, avoided a nervous breakdown. The man was an executive in a big Chicago firm. When he came to Dr. Sadler's office, he was tense, nervous, worried. He knew he was heading for a tailspin, but he couldn't quit work. He had to have help.

“While this man was telling me his story,”Dr. Sadler says,“my telephone rang. It was the hospital calling; and, instead of deferring the matter, I took time right then to come to a decision. I always settle questions, if possible, right on the spot. I had no sooner hung up than the phone rang again. Again an urgent matter, which I took time to discuss. The third interruption came when a colleague of mine came to my office for advice on a patient who was critically ill. When I had finished with him, I turned to my caller and began to apologise for keeping him waiting. But he had brightened up. He had a completely different look on his face.”

“Don't apologise, doctor!”this man said to Sadler.“In the last ten minutes, I think I've got a hunch as to what is wrong with me. I'm going back to my offices and revise my working habits.... But before I go, do you mind if I take a look in your desk?”Dr. Sadler opened up the drawers of his desk. All empty—except for supplies.“Tell me,”said the patient,“where do you keep your unfinished business?”

“Finished!”said Sadler.

“And where do you keep your unanswered mail?”

“Answered!”Sadler told him.“My rule is never to lay down a letter until I have answered it. I dictate the reply to my secretary at once.”

Six weeks later, this same executive invited Dr. Sadler to come to his office. He was changed—and so was his desk. He opened the desk drawers to show there was no unfinished business inside of the desk.“Six weeks ago,”this executive said,“I had three different desks in two different offices—and was snowed under by my work. I was never finished. After talking to you, I came back here and cleared out a wagon-load of reports and old papers. Now I work at one desk, settle things as they come up, and don't have a mountain of unfinished business nagging at me and making me tense and worried. But the most astonishing thing is I've recovered completely. There is nothing wrong any more with my health!”

Charles Evans Hughes, former Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, said:“Men do not die from overwork. They die from dissipation and worry.”Yes, from dissipation of their energies—and worry because they never seem to get their work done.





Good Working Habit No. 2: Do Things in the Order of Their Importance.


Henry L. Dougherty, founder of the nation-wide Cities Service Company, said that regardless of how much salary he paid, there were two abilities he found it almost impossible to find.

Those two priceless abilities are: first, the ability to think. Second, the ability to do things in the order of their importance.

Charles Luckman, the lad who started from scratch and climbed in twelve years to president of the Pepsodent Company, got a salary of a hundred thousand dollars a year, and made a million dollars besides—that lad declares that he owes much of his success to developing the two abilities that Henry L. Dougherty said he found almost impossible to find. Charles Luckman said:“As far back as I can remember, I have got up at five o'clock in the morning because I can think better then than any other time—I can think better then and plan my day, plan to do things in the order of their importance.”Franklin Bettger, one of America's most successful insurance salesmen, doesn't wait until five o'clock in the morning to plan his day. He plans it the night before-sets a goal for himself—a goal to sell a certain amount of insurance that day. If he fails, that amount is added to the next day—and so on.

I know from long experience that one is not always able to do things in the order of their importance, but I also know that some kind of plan to do first things first is infinitely better than extemporising as you go along. If George Bernard Shaw had not made it a rigid rule to do first things first, he would probably have failed as a writer and might have remained a bank cashier all his life. His plan called for writing five pages each day. That plan and his dogged determination to carry it through saved him. That plan inspired him to go right on writing five pages a day for nine heartbreaking years, even though he made a total of only thirty dollars in those nine years—about a penny a day.





Good Working Habit No. 3: When You Face a Problem, Solve It Then and There if You Have the Facts Necessary to Make a Decision. Don't Keep Putting off Decisions.


One of my former students, the late H.P. Howell, told me that when he was a member of the board of directors of U.S. Steel, the meetings of the board were often long-drawn-out affairs—many problems were discussed, few decisions were made. The result: each member of the board had to carry home bundles of reports to study.

Finally, Mr. Howell persuaded the board of directors to take up one problem at a time and come to a decision. No procrastination— no putting off. The decision might be to ask for additional facts; it might be to do something or do nothing. But a decision was reached on each problem before passing on to the next. Mr. Howell told me that the results were striking and salutary: the docket was cleared. The calendar was clean. No longer was it necessary for each member to carry home a bundle of reports. No longer was there a worried sense of unresolved problems.

A good rule, not only for the board of directors of U.S. Steel, but for you and me.





Good Working Habit No. 4: Learn to Organise, Deputise, and Supervise.


Many a business man is driving himself to a premature grave because he has never learned to delegate responsibility to others, insists on doing everything himself. Result: details and confusion overwhelm him. He is driven by a sense of hurry, worry, anxiety, and tension. It is hard to learn to delegate responsibilities. I know. It was hard for me, awfully hard. I also know from experience the disasters that can be caused by delegating authority to the wrong people. But difficult as it is to delegate authority, the executive must do it if he is to avoid worry, tension, and fatigue.

The man who builds up a big business, and doesn't learn to organise, deputise, and supervise, usually pops off with heart trouble in his fifties or early sixties—heart trouble caused by tension and worries. Want a specific instance? Look at the death notices in your local paper.





Chapter 4　Remember That No One Ever Kicks a Dead Dog


An event occurred in 1929 that created a national sensation in educational circles. Learned men from all over America rushed to Chicago to witness the affair. A few years earlier, a young man by the name of Robert Hutchins had worked his way through Yale, acting as a waiter, a lumberjack, a tutor, and a clothes-line salesman. Now, only eight years later, he was being inaugurated as president of the fourth richest university in America, the University of Chicago. His age? Thirty. Incredible! The older educators shook their heads. Criticism came roaring down upon the“boy wonder”like a rockslide. He was this and he was that—too young, inexperienced— his educational ideas were cockeyed. Even the newspapers joined in the attack.

The day he was inaugurated, a friend said to the father of Robert Maynard Hutchins:“I was shocked this morning to read that newspaper editorial denouncing your son.”

“Yes,”the elder Hutchins replied,“it was severe, but remember that no one ever kicks a dead dog.”

Yes, and the more important a dog is, the more satisfaction people get in kicking him. The Prince of Wales who later became Edward VIII (now Duke of Windsor) had that forcibly brought home to him.

He was attending Dartmouth College in Devonshire at the time—a college that corresponds to the Naval Academy at Annapolis. The Prince was about fourteen. One day one of the naval officers found him crying, and asked him what was wrong. He refused to tell at first, but finally admitted the truth: he was being kicked by the naval cadets. The commodore of the college summoned the boys and explained to them that the Prince had not complained, but he wanted to find out why the Prince had been singled out for this rough treatment.

After much hemming and hawing and toe scraping, the cadets finally confessed that when they themselves became commanders and captains in the King's Navy, they wanted to be able to say that they had kicked the King!

So when you are kicked and criticised, remember that it is often done because it gives the kicker a feeling of importance. It often means that you are accomplishing something and are worthy of attention. Many people get a sense of savage satisfaction out of denouncing those who are better educated than they are or more successful. For example, while I was writing this chapter, I received a letter from a woman denouncing General William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army. I had given a laudatory broadcast about General Booth; so this woman wrote me, saying that General Booth had stolen eight million dollars of the money he had collected to help poor people. The charge, of course, was absurd. But this woman wasn't looking for truth. She was seeking the mean-spirited gratification that she got from tearing down someone far above her. I threw her bitter letter into the wastebasket, and thanked Almighty God that I wasn't married to her. Her letter didn't tell me anything at all about General Booth, but it did tell me a lot about her. Schopenhauer had said it years ago:“Vulgar people take huge delight in the faults and follies of great men.”

One hardly thinks of the president of Yale as a vulgar man; yet a former president of Yale, Timothy Dwight, apparently took huge delight in denouncing a man who was running for President of the United States. The president of Yale warned that if this man were elected President,“we may see our wives and daughters the victims of legal prostitution, soberly dishonoured, speciously polluted; the outcasts of delicacy and virtue, the loathing of God and man.”

Sounds almost like a denunciation of Hitler, doesn't it? But it wasn't. It was a denunciation of Thomas Jefferson. Which Thomas Jefferson? Surely not the immortal Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, the patron saint of democracy? Yes, verily, that was the man.

What American do you suppose was denounced as a“hypocrite”,“an impostor”, and as“little better than a murderer”? A newspaper cartoon depicted him on a guillotine, the big knife read to cut off his head. Crowds jeered at him and hissed him as he rode through the street. Who was he? George Washington.

But that occurred a long time ago. Maybe human nature has improved since then. Let's see. Let's take the case of Admiral Peary—the explorer who startled and thrilled the world by reaching the North Pole with dog sleds on April 6, 1909—a goal that brave men for centuries had suffered and died to attain. Peary himself almost died from cold and starvation; and eight of his toes were frozen so hard they had to be cut off. He was so overwhelmed with disasters that he feared he would go insane. His superior naval officers in Washington were burned up because Peary was getting so much publicity and acclaim. So they accused him of collecting money for scientific expeditions and then“lying around and loafing in the Arctic.”And they probably believed it, because it is almost impossible not to believe what you want to believe. Their determination to humiliate and block Peary was so violent that only a direct order from President McKinley enabled Peary to continued his career in the Arctic.

Would Peary have been denounced if he had had a desk job in the Navy Department in Washington. No. He wouldn't have been important enough then to have aroused jealousy.

General Grant had an even worse experience than Admiral Peary. In 1862, General Grant won the first great decisive victory that the North had enjoyed—a victory that was achieved in one afternoon, a victory that made Grant a national idol overnight—a victory that had tremendous repercussions even in far-off Europe—a victory that set church bells ringing and bonfires blazing from Maine to the banks of the Mississippi. Yet within six weeks after achieving that great victory, Grant—hero of the North—was arrested and his army was taken from him. He wept with humiliation and despair.

Why was General U.S. Grant arrested at the flood tide of his victory? Largely because he had aroused the jealousy and envy of his arrogant superiors.




If we are tempted to be worried about unjust criticism here is Rule:

REMEMBER THAT UNJUST CRITICISM IS OFTEN A DISGUISED COMPLIMENT. REMEMBER THAT NO ONE EVER KICKS A DEAD DOG.





Chapter 5　Do This—and Criticism Can't Hurt You


I once interviewed Major-General Smedley Butler—old“Gimlet- Eye”. Old“Hell-Devil”Butler! Remember him? The most colourful, swashbuckling general who ever commanded the United States Marines.

He told me that when he was young, he was desperately eager to be popular, wanted to make a good impression on everyone. In those days the slightest criticism smarted and stung. But he confessed that thirty years in the Marines had toughened his hide.“I have been berated and insulted,”he said,“and denounced as a yellow dog, a snake, and a skunk. I have been cursed by the experts. I have been called every possible combination of unprintable cuss words in the English language. Bother me? Huh! When I hear someone cussing me now, I never turn my head to see who is talking.”

Maybe old“Gimlet-Eye”Butler was too indifferent to criticism; but one thing is sure: most of us take the little jibes and javelins that are hurled at us far too seriously. I remember the time, years ago, when a reporter from the New York Sun attended a demonstration meeting of my adult-education classes and lampooned me and my work. Was I burned up? I took it as a personal insult. I telephoned Gill Hodges, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Sun, and practically demanded that he print an article stating the facts— instead of ridicule. I was determined to make the punishment fit the crime.

I am ashamed now of the way I acted. I realise now that half the people who bought the paper never saw that article. Half of those who read it regarded it as a source of innocent merriment. Half of those who gloated over it forgot all about it in a few weeks.

I realise now that people are not thinking about you and me or caring what is said about us. They are thinking about themselves— before breakfast, after breakfast, and right on until ten minutes past midnight. They would be a thousand times more concerned about a slight headache of their own than they would about the news of your death or mine.

Even if you and I are lied about, ridiculed, double-crossed, knifed in the back, and sold down the river by one out of every six of our most intimate friends—let's not indulge in an orgy of self-pity. Instead, let's remind ourselves that that's precisely what happened to Jesus. One of His twelve most intimate friends turned traitor for a bribe that would amount, in our modern money, to about nineteen dollars. Another one of His twelve most intimate friends openly deserted Jesus the moment He got into trouble, and declared three times that he didn't even know Jesus—and he swore as he said it. One out of six! That is what happened to Jesus. Why should you and I expect a better score?

I discovered years ago that although I couldn't keep people from criticising me unjustly, I could do something infinitely more important: I could determine whether I would let the unjust condemnation disturb me.

Let's be clear about this: I am not advocating ignoring all criticism. Far from it. I am talking about ignoring only unjust criticism. I once asked Eleanor Roosevelt how she handled unjust criticism—and Allah knows she's had a lot of it. She probably has more ardent friends and more violent enemies than any other woman who ever lived in the White House.

She told me that as a young girl she was almost morbidly shy, afraid of what people might say. She was so afraid of criticism that one day she asked her aunt, Theodore Roosevelt's sister for advice. She said:“Auntie Bye, I want to do so-and-so. But I'm afraid of being criticised.”

Teddy Roosevelt's sister looked her in the eye and said:“Never be bothered by what people say, as long as you know in your heart you are right.”Eleanor Roosevelt told me that that bit of advice proved to be her Rock of Gibraltar years later, when she was in the White House. She told me that the only way we can avoid all criticism is to be like a Dresden-china figure and stay on a shelf.“Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you'll be criticised, anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.”That is her advice.

When the late Matthew C. Brush, was president of the American International Corporation at 40 Wall Street, I asked him if he was ever sensitive to criticism; and he replied:“Yes, I was very sensitive to it in my early days. I was eager then to have all the employees in the organization think I was perfect. If they didn't, it worried me. I would try to please first one person who had been sounding off against me; but the very thing I did to patch it up with him would make someone else mad. Then when I tried to fix it up with this person, I would stir up a couple of other bumblebees. I finally discovered that the more I tried to pacify and to smooth over injured feelings in order to escape personal criticism, the more certain I was to increase my enemies. So finally I said to myself:‘If you get your head above the crowd, you're going to be criticised. So get used to the idea.’That helped me tremendously. From that time on I made it a rule to do the very best I could and then put up my old umbrella and let the rain of criticism drain off me instead of running down my neck.”

Deems Taylor went a bit further: he let the rain of criticism run down his neck and had a good laugh over it—in public. When he was giving his comments during the intermission of the Sunday afternoon radio concerts of the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, one woman wrote him a letter calling him“a liar, a traitor, a snake and a moron”.

On the following week's broadcast, Mr. Taylor read this letter over the radio to millions of listeners. In his book, Of Men & Music, he tells us that a few days later he received another letter from the same lady,“expressing her unaltered opinion that I was still a liar, a traitor, a snake and a moron. I have a suspicion,”adds Mr. Taylor,“that she didn't care for that talk.”We can't keep from admiring a man who takes criticism like that. We admire his serenity, his unshaken poise, and his sense of humour.

When Charles Schwab was addressing the student body at Princeton, he confessed that one of the most important lessons he had ever learned was taught to him by an old German who worked in Schwab's steel mill. The old German got involved in a hot wartime argument with the other steelworkers, and they tossed him into the river.“When he came into my office,”Mr. Schwab said,“covered with mud and water, I asked him what he had said to the men who had thrown him into the river, and he replied:‘I just laughed.’”

Mr. Schwab declared that he had adopted that old German's words as his motto:“Just laugh.”That motto is especially good when you are the victim of unjust criticism. You can answer the man who answers you back, but what can you say to the man who“just laughs”?

Lincoln might have broken under the strain of the Civil War if he hadn't learned the folly of trying to answer all his savage critics. He finally said:“If I were to try to read, much less to answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep on doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, then what is said against me won't matter. If the end brings me out wrong, then ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.”




When you and I are unjustly criticised, let's remember:

DO THE VERY BEST YON CAN: AND THEN PUT UP YOUR OLD UMBRELLA AND KEEP THE RAIN OF CRITICISM FROM RUNNING DOWN THE BACK OF YOUR NECK.





Chapter 6　Would You Take a Million Dollars for What You Have?


I have known Harold Abbott for years. He lives at 820 South Madison Avenue, Webb City, Missouri. He used to be my lecture manager. One day he and I met in Kansas City and he drove me down to my farm at Belton, Missouri. During that drive, I asked him how he kept from worrying; and he told me an inspiring story that I shall never forget.

“I used to worry a lot,”he said,“but one spring day in 1934, I was walking down West Dougherty Street in Webb City when I saw a sight that banished all my worries. It all happened in ten seconds, but during those ten seconds I learned more about how to live than I had learned in the previous ten years. For two years I had been running a grocery store in Webb City,”Harold Abbott said, as he told me the story.“I had not only lost all my savings, but I had incurred debts that took me seven years to pay back. My grocery store had been closed the previous Saturday; and now I was going to the Merchants and Miners Bank to borrow money so I could go to Kansas City to look for a job. I walked like a beaten man. I had lost all my fight and faith. Then suddenly I saw coming down the street a man who had no legs. He was sitting on a little wooden platform equipped with wheels from roller skates. He propelled himself along the street with a block of wood in each hand. I met him just after he had crossed the street and was starting to lift himself up a few inches over the kerb to the sidewalk. As he tilted his little wooden platform to an angle, his eyes met mine. He greeted me with a grand smile.‘Good morning, sir. It is a fine morning, isn't it?’he said with spirit. As I stood looking at him, I realised how rich I was. I had two legs. I could walk. I felt ashamed of my self-pity. I said to myself if he can be happy, cheerful, and confident without legs, I certainly can with legs. I could already feel my chest lifting. I had intended to ask the Merchants and Miners Bank for only one hundred dollars. But now I had courage to ask for two hundred. I had intended to say that I wanted to go to Kansas City to try to get a job. But now I announced confidently that I wanted to go to Kansas City to get a job. I got the loan; and I got the job.”I now have the following words pasted on my bathroom mirror, and I read them every morning as I shave:

I had the blues because I had no shoes,

Until upon the street, I met a man who had no feet.

I once asked Eddie Rickenbacker what was the biggest lesson he had learned from drifting about with his companions in life rafts for twenty-one days, hopelessly lost in the Pacific.“The biggest lesson I learned from that experience,”he said,“was that if you have all the fresh water you want to drink and all the food you want to eat, you ought never to complain about anything.”

Time ran an article about a sergeant who had been wounded on Guadalcanal. Hit in the throat by a shell fragment, this sergeant had had seven blood transfusions. Writing a note to his doctor, he asked:“Will I live?”The doctor replied:“Yes.”He wrote another note, asking:“Will I be able to talk?”Again the answer was yes. He then wrote another note, saying:“Then what in hell am I worrying about?”

Why don't you stop right now and ask yourself:“What in the hell am I worrying about?”You will probably find that it is comparatively unimportant and insignificant.

About ninety percent of the things in our lives are right and about ten percent are wrong. If we want to be happy, all we have to do is to concentrate on the ninety percent that are right and ignore the ten percent that are wrong. If we want to be worried and bitter and have stomach ulcers, all we have to do is to concentrate on the ten percent that are wrong and ignore the ninety percent that are glorious.

The words“Think and Thank”are inscribed in many of the Cromwellian churches of England. These words ought to be inscribed in our hearts, too:“Think and Thank”. Think of all we have to be grateful for, and thank God for all our boons and bounties.

Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, was the most devastating pessimist in English literature. He was so sorry that he had been born that he wore black and fasted on his birthdays; yet, in his despair, this supreme pessimist of English literature praised the great health—giving powers of cheerfulness and happiness.“The best doctors in the world,”he declared,“are Doctor Diet, Doctor Quiet, and Doctor Merryman.”

You and I may have the services of“Doctor Merryman”free every hour of the day by keeping our attention fixed on all the incredible riches we possess—riches exceeding by far the fabled treasures of Ali Baba. Would you sell both your eyes for a billion dollars? What would you take for your two legs? Your hands? Your hearing? Your children? Your family? Add up your assets, and you will find that you won't sell what you have for all the gold ever amassed by the Rockefellers, the Fords and the Morgans combined.

But do we appreciate all this? Ah, no. As Schopenhauer said:“We seldom think of what we have but always of what we lack.”Yes, the tendency to“seldom think of what we have but always of what we lack”is the greatest tragedy on earth. It has probably caused more misery than all the wars and diseases in history.It caused John Palmer to turn“from a regular guy into an old grouch”, and almost wrecked his home. I know because he told me so.

Mr. Palmer lives at 30 19th Avenue, Paterson, New Jersey.“Shortly after I returned from the Army,”he said,“I started in business for myself. I worked hard day and night. Things were going nicely. Then trouble started. I couldn't get parts and materials. I was afraid I would have to give up my business. I worried so much that I changed from a regular guy into an old grouch. I became so sour and cross that—well, I didn't know it then; but I now realise that I came very near to losing my happy home. Then one day a young, disabled veteran who works for me said:‘Johnny, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You take on as if you were the only person in the world with troubles. Suppose you do have to shut up shop for a while—so what? You can start up again when things get normal. You've got a lot to be thankful for. Yet you are always growling. Boy, how I wish I were in your shoes I Look at me. I've got only one arm, and half of my face is shot away, and yet I am not complaining. If you don't stop your growling and grumbling, you will lose not only your business, but also your health, your home, and your friends!’

“Those remarks stopped me dead in my tracks. They made me realize how well off I was. I resolved then and there that I would change and be my old self again—and I did.”

A friend of mine, Lucile Blake, had to tremble on the edge of tragedy before she learned to be happy about what she had instead of worrying over what she lacked.

I met Lucile years ago, when we were both studying short-story writing in the Columbia University School of Journalism. Nine years ago, she got the shock of her life. She was living then in Tucson, Arizonia. She had—well, here is the story as she told it to me:

“I had been living in a whirl: studying the organ at the University of Arizona, conducting a speech clinic in town, and teaching a class in musical appreciation at the Desert Willow Ranch, where I was staying. I was going in for parties, dances, horseback rides under the stars. One morning I collapsed. My heart!‘You will have to lie in bed for a year of complete rest,’the doctor said. He didn't encourage me to believe I would ever be strong again.

“In bed for a year! To be an invalid—perhaps to die! I was terror-stricken! Why did all this have to happen to me? What had I done to deserve it? I wept and wailed. I was bitter and rebellious. But I did go to bed as the doctor advised. A neighbour of mine, Mr. Rudolf, an artist, said to me:‘You think now that spending a year in bed will be a tragedy. But it won't be. You will have time to think and get acquainted with yourself. You will make more spiritual growth in these next few months than you have made during all your previous life.’I became calmer, and tried to develop a new sense of values. I read books of inspiration. One day I heard a radio commentator say:‘You can express only what is in your own consciousness.’I had heard words like these many times before, but now they reached down inside me and took root. I resolved to think only the thoughts I wanted to live by: thoughts of joy, happiness, health. I forced myself each morning, as soon as I awoke, to go over all the things I had to be grateful for. No pain. A lovely young daughter. My eyesight. My hearing. Lovely music on the radio. Time to read. Good food. Good friends. I was so cheerful and had so many visitors that the doctor put up a sign saying that only one visitor at a time would be allowed in my cabin—and only at certain hours.

“Nine years have passed since then, and I now lead a full, active life. I am deeply grateful now for that year I spent in bed. It was the most valuable and the happiest year I spent in Arizona. The habit I formed then of counting my blessings each morning still remains with me. It is one of my most precious possessions. I am ashamed to realise that I never really learned to live until I feared I was going to die.”

My dear Lucile Blake, you may not realise it, but you learned the same lesson that Dr. Samuel Johnson learned two hundred years ago.“The habit of looking on the best side of every event,”said Dr. Johnson,“is worth more than a thousand pounds a year.”

Those words were uttered, mind you, not by a professional optimist, but by a man who had known anxiety, rags, and hunger for twenty years—and finally became one of the most eminent writers of his generation and the most celebrated conversationalist of all time.

Logan Pearsall Smith packed a lot of wisdom into a few words when he said:“There are two things to aim at in life: first, to get what you want; and, after that, to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.”

Would you like to know how to make even dishwashing at the kitchen sink a thrilling experience? If so, read an inspiring book of incredible courage by Borghild Dahl. It is called I Wanted to See.

This book was written by a woman who was practically blind for half a century.“I had only one eye,”she writes,“and it was so covered with dense scars that I had to do all my seeing through one small opening in the left of the eye. I could see a book only by holding it up close to my face and by straining my one eye as hard as I could to the left.”

But she refused to be pitied, refused to be considered“different”. As a child, she wanted to play hopscotch with other children, but she couldn't see the markings. So after the other children had gone home, she got down on the ground and crawled along with her eyes near to the marks. She memorised every bit of the ground where she and her friends played and soon became an expert at running games. She did her reading at home, holding a book of large print so close to her eyes that her eyelashes brushed the pages. She earned two college degrees: an A.B. from the University of Minnesota and a Master of Arts from Columbia University.

She started teaching in the tiny village of Twin Valley, Minnesota, and rose until she became professor of journalism and literature at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. She taught there for thirteen years, lecturing before women's clubs and giving radio talks about books and authors.“In the back of my mind,”she writes,“there had always lurked a fear of total blindness. In order to overcome this, I had adopted a cheerful, almost hilarious, attitude towards life.”

Then in 1943, when she was fifty-two years old, a miracle happened: an operation at the famous Mayo Clinic. She could now see forty times as well as she had ever been able to see before. A new and exciting world of loveliness opened before her. She now found it thrilling even to wash dishes in the kitchen sink.“I begin to play with the white fluffy suds in the dishpan,”she writes.“I dip my hands into them and I pick up a ball of tiny soap bubbles. I hold them up against the light, and in each of them I can see the brilliant colours of a miniature rainbow.”

As she looked through the window above the kitchen sink, she saw“the flapping grey-black wings of the sparrows flying through the thick, falling snow.”

She found such ecstasy looking at the soap bubbles and sparrows that she closed her book with these words:“‘Dear Lord,’I whisper,‘Our Father in Heaven, I thank Thee. I thank Thee.’”

Imagine thanking God because you can wash dishes and see rainbows in bubbles and sparrows flying through the snow.

You and I ought to be ashamed of ourselves. All the days of our years we have been living in a fairyland of beauty, but we have been too blind to see, too satiated to enjoy.




If we want to stop worrying and start living:

COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS—NOT YOUR TROUBLES!





Part Two　Prevent Fatigue and Worry and Keep Your Energy and Spirits High





Chapter 7　Find Yourself and Be Yourself: Remember There Is No One Else on Earth like You


I have a letter from Mrs. Edith Allred, of Mount Airy, North Carolina:“As a child, I was extremely sensitive and shy,”she says in her letter.“I was always overweight and my cheeks made me look even fatter than I was. I had an old-fashioned mother who thought it was foolish to make clothes look pretty. She always said:‘Wide will wear while narrow will tear’; and she dressed me accordingly. I never went to parties; never had any fun; and when I went to school, I never joined the other children in outside activities, not even athletics. I was morbidly shy. I felt I was‘different’from everybody else, and entirely undesirable.

“When I grew up, I married a man who was several years my senior. But I didn't change. My in-laws were a poised and self-confident family. They were everything I should have been but simply was not. I tried my best to be like them, but I couldn't. Every attempt they made to draw me out of myself only drove me further into my shell. I became nervous and irritable. I avoided all friends. I got so bad I even dreaded the sound of the doorbell ringing! I was a failure. I knew it; and I was afraid my husband would find it out. So, whenever we were in public, I tried to be gay, and overacted my part. I knew I overacted; and I would be miserable for days afterwards. At last I became so unhappy that I could see no point in prolonging my existence. I began to think of suicide.”

What happened to change this unhappy woman's life? Just a chance remark!“A chance remark,”Mrs. Allred continued,“transformed my whole life. My mother-in-law was talking one day of how she brought her children up, and she said:‘No matter what happened, I always insisted on their being themselves.’...‘On being themselves.’... That remark is what did it! In a flash, I realised I had brought all this misery on myself by trying to fit myself into a pattern to which I did not conform.

“I changed overnight! I started being myself. I tried to make a study of my own personality. Tried to find out what I was. I studied my strong points. I learned all I could about colours and styles, and dressed in a way that I felt was becoming to me. I reached out to make friends. I joined an organisationa small one at first—and was petrified with fright when they put me on a programme. But each time I spoke, I gained a little courage. It took a long while—but today I have more happiness than I ever dreamed possible. In rearing my own children, I have always taught them the lesson I had to learn from such bitter experience: No matter what happens, always be yourself!”

This problem of being willing to be yourself is“as old as history,”says Dr. James Gordon Gilkey,“and as universal as human life.”This problem of being unwilling to be yourself is the hidden spring behind many neuroses and psychoses and complexes. Angelo Patri has written thirteen books and thousands of syndicated newspaper articles on the subject of child training, and he says:“Nobody is so miserable as he who longs to be somebody and something other than the person he is in body and mind.”

This craving to be something you are not is especially rampant in Hollywood. Sam Wood, one of Hollywood's best-known directors, says the greatest headache he has with aspiring young actors is exactly this problem: to make them be themselves. They all want to be second-rate Lana Turners, or third-rate Clark Gables.“The public has already had that flavour,”Sam Wood keeps telling them;“now it wants something else.”

Before he started directing such pictures as Good-bye, Mr. Chips and For Whom the Bell Tolls, Sam Wood spent years in the real-estate business, developing sales personalities. He declares that the same principles apply in the business world as in the world of moving pictures. You won't get anywhere playing the ape. You can't be a parrot.“Experience has taught me,”says Sam Wood,“that it is safest to drop, as quickly as possible, people who pretend to be what they aren't.”

I recently asked Paul Boynton, employment director for the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, what is the biggest mistake people make in applying for jobs. He ought to know: he has interviewed more than sixty thousand job seekers; and he has written a book entitled 6 Ways to Get a Job. He replied:“The biggest mistake people make in applying for jobs is in not being themselves. Instead of taking their hair down and being completely frank, they often try to give you the answers they think you want.”But it doesn't work, because nobody wants a phony. Nobody ever wants a counterfeit coin.

A certain daughter of a street-car conductor had to learn that lesson the hard way. She longed to be a singer. But her face was her misfortune. She had a large mouth and protruding buck teeth. When she first sang in public—in a New Jersey night-club—she tried to pull down her upper Up to cover her teeth. She tried to act“glamorous”. The result? She made herself ridiculous. She was headed for failure.

However, there was a man in this night-club who heard the girl sing and thought she had talent.“See here,”he said bluntly,“I've been watching your performance and I know what it is you're trying to hide. You're ashamed of your teeth.”The girl was embarrassed, but the man continued:“What of it? Is there any particular crime in having buck teeth? Don't try to hide them! Open your mouth, and the audience will love you when they see you're not ashamed. Besides,”he said shrewdly,“those teeth you're trying to hide may make your fortune!”

Cass Daley took his advice and forgot about her teeth. From that time on, she thought only about her audience. She opened her mouth wide and sang with such gusto and enjoyment that she became a top star in movies and radio. Other comedians are now trying to copy her!

The renowned William James was speaking of men who had never found themselves when he declared that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental abilities.“Compared to what we ought to be,”he wrote,“we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.”

You and I have such abilities, so let's not waste a second worrying because we are not like other people. You are something new in this world. Never before, since the beginning of time, has there ever been anybody exactly like you; and never again throughout all the ages to come will there ever be anybody exactly like you again. The new science of genetics informs us that you are what you are largely as a result of twenty-four chromosomes contributed by your father and twenty-four chromosomes contributed by your mother. These forty-eight chromosomes comprise everything that determines what you inherit. In each chromosome there may be, says Amran Sheinfeld,“anywhere from scores to hundreds of genes—with a single gene, in some cases, able to change the whole life of an individual.”Truly, we are“fearfully and wonderfully”made.

Even after your mother and father met and mated, there was only one chance in 300,000 billion that the person who is specifically you would be born! In other words, if you had 300,000 billion brothers and sisters, they might have all been different from you. Is all this guesswork? No. It is a scientific fact. If you would like to read more about it, go to your public library and borrow a book entitled You and Heredity, by Amran Scheinfeld.

I can talk with conviction about this subject of being yourself because I feel deeply about it. I know what I am talking about. I know from bitter and costly experience. To illustrate: when I first came to New York from the cornfields of Missouri, I enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. I aspired to be an actor. I had what I thought was a brilliant idea, a short cut to success, an idea so simple, so foolproof, that I couldn't understand why thousands of ambitious people hadn't already discovered it. It was this: I would study how the famous actors of that day—John Drew, Walter Hampden, and Otis Skinner—got their effects. Then I would imitate the best point of each one of them and make myself into a shining, triumphant combination of all of them. How silly I How absurd! I had to waste years of my life imitating other people before it penetrated through my thick Missouri skull that I had to be myself, and that I couldn't possibly be anyone else.

That distressing experience ought to have taught me a lasting lesson. But it didn't. Not me. I was too dumb. I had to learn it all over again. Several years later, I set out to write what I hoped would be the best book on public speaking for business men that had ever been written. I had the same foolish idea about writing this book that I had formerly had about acting: I was going to borrow the ideas of a lot of other writers and put them all in one book—a book that would have everything. So I got scores of books on public speaking and spent a year incorporating their ideas into my manuscript. But it finally dawned on me once again that I was playing the fool. This hodgepodge of other men's ideas that I had written was so synthetic, so dull, that no business man would ever plod through it. So I tossed a year's work into the wastebasket, and started all over again.

This time I said to myself:“You've got to be Dale Carnegie, with all his faults and limitations. You can't possibly be anybody else.”So I quit trying to be a combination of other men, and rolled up my sleeves and did what I should have done in the first place: I wrote a textbook on public speaking out of my own experiences, observations, and convictions as a speaker and a teacher of speaking. I learned—for all time, I hope—the lesson that Sir Walter Raleigh learned. (I am not talking about the Sir Walter who threw his coat in the mud for the Queen to step on. I am talking about the Sir Walter Raleigh who was professor of English literature at Oxford back in 1904.)“I can't write a book commensurate with Shakespeare,”he said,“but I can write a book by me.”

Be yourself. Act on the sage advice that Irving Berlin gave the late George Gershwin. When Berlin and Gershwin first met, Berlin was famous but Gershwin was a struggling young composer working for thirty-five dollars a week in Tin Pan Alley. Berlin, impressed by Gershwin's ability, offered Gershwin a job as his musical secretary at almost three times the salary he was then getting.“But don't take the job,”Berlin advised.“If you do, you may develop into a second-rate Berlin. But if you insist on being yourself, some day you'll become a first-rate Gershwin.”

Gershwin heeded that warning and slowly transformed himself into one of the significant American composer of his generation.

Charlie Chaplin, Will Rogers, Mary Margaret McBride, Gene Autry, and millions of others had to learn the lesson I am trying to hammer home in this chapter. They had to learn the hard way—just as I did.

When Charlie Chaplin first started making films, the director of the pictures insisted on Chaplin's imitating a popular German comedian of that day. Charlie Chaplin got nowhere until he acted himself. Bob Hope had a similar experience: spent years in a singing-and-dancing act—and got nowhere until he began to wisecrack and be himself. Will Rogers twirled a rope in vaudeville for years without saying a word. He got nowhere until he discovered his unique gift for humour and began to talk as he twirled his rope.

When Mary Margaret McBride first went on the air, she tried to be an Irish comedian and failed. When she tried to be just what she was—a plain country girl from Missouri—she became one of the most popular radio stars in New York.

When Gene Autry tried to get rid of his Texas accent and dressed like city boys and claimed he was from New York, people merely laughed behind his back. But when he started twanging his banjo and singing cowboy ballads, Gene Autry started out on a career that made him the world's most popular cowboy both in pictures and on the radio.

You are something new in this world. Be glad of it. Make the most of what nature gave you. In the last analysis, all art is autobiographical. You can sing only what you are. You can paint only what you are. You must be what your experiences, your environment, and your heredity have made you. For better or for worse, you must cultivate your own little garden. For better or for worse, you must play your own little instrument in the orchestra of life.

As Emerson said in his essay on“Self-Reliance”:“There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.”

That is the way Emerson said it. But here is the way a poet—the late Douglas Malloch—said it:

If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill.

Be a scrub in the valley—but be

The best little scrub by the side of the rill;

Be a bush, if you can't be a tree.



If you can't be a bush, be a bit of the grass.

And some highway happier make;

If you can't be a muskie, then just be a bass—

But the liveliest bass in the lake!



We can't all be captains, we've got to be crew.

There's something for all of us here.

There's big work to do and there's lesser to do

And the task we must do is the near.



If you can't be a highway, then just be a trail,

If you can't be the sun, be a star;

It isn't by the size that you win or you fail—

Be the best of whatever you are!




To cultivate a mental attitude that will bring us peace and freedom from worry:

LET'S NOT IMITATE OTHERS. LET'S FIND OURSELVES AND BE OURSELVES.





Chapter 8　Do This and You'll Be Welcome Anywhere


Why read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the technique of the greatest winner of friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you.

Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn't have to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love.

When I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup for fifty cents. He was the light and joy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes staring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the buck brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of sheer ecstasy.

Tippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic night—I shall never forget it—he was killed within ten feet of my head, killed by lightning. Tippy's death was the tragedy of my boyhood.

You never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn't need to. You knew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested in them.

Of course, it doesn't work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves— morning, noon and after dinner.

The New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out which word is the most frequently used.You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun“I.”“I.”“I.”It was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations.“I.”“I.”“I.”“I.”

When you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture do you look for first?

If we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true, sincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.

Napoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said:“Josephine, I have been as fortunate as any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can rely.”And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.

Alfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book entitled What Life Should Mean to You. In that book he says:“It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.”

You may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming across a statement more significant for you and for me. Adler's statement is so rich with meaning that 1 am going to repeat it in italics:

It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.

I once took a course in short-story writing at New York University, and during that course the editor of a leading magazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that drifted across his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he could feel whether or not the author liked people.“If the author doesn't like people,”he said,“people won't like his or her stories.”

This hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on fiction writing and apologized for preaching a sermon.“I am telling you,”he said,“the same things your preacher would tell you, but remember, you have to be interested in people if you want to be a successful writer of stories.”

If that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing with people face-to-face.

I spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard Thurston the last time he appeared on Broadway—Thurston was the acknowledged dean of magicians. For forty years he had traveled all over the world, time and again, creating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making people gasp with astonishment. More than 60 million people had paid admission to his show, and he had made almost $2 million in profit.

I asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success. His schooling certainly had nothing to do with it, for he ran away from home as a small boy, became a hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in haystacks, begged his food from door to door, and learned to read by looking out of boxcars at signs along the railway.

Did he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he told me hundreds of books had been written about legerdemain and scores of people knew as much about it as he did. But he had two things that the others didn't have. First, he had the ability to put his personality across the footlights. He was a master showman. He knew human nature. Everything he did, every gesture, every intonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully rehearsed in advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds. But, in addition to that, Thurston had a genuine interest in people. He told me that many magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves,“Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I'll fool them all right.”But Thurston's method was totally different. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to himself:“I am grateful because these people come to see me. They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I'm going to give them the very best I possibly can.”

He declared he never stepped in front of the footlights without first saying to himself over and over:“I love my audience. I love my audience.”Ridiculous? Absurd? You are privileged to think anything you like. I am merely passing it on to you without comment as a recipe used by one of the most famous magicians of all time.

George Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was forced to retire from his service station business after thirty years when a new highway was constructed over the site of his station. It wasn't long before the idle days of retirement began to bore him, so he started filling in his time trying to play music on his old fiddle. Soon he was traveling the area to listen to music and talk with many of the accomplished fiddlers. In his humble and friendly way he became generally interested in learning the background and interests of every musician he met. Although he was not a great fiddler himself, he made many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions and soon became known to the country music fans in the eastern part of the United States as“Uncle George, the Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua County.”When we heard Uncle George, he was seventy-two and enjoying every minute of his life. By having a sustained interest in other people, he created a new life for himself at a time when most people consider their productive years over.

That, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt's astonishing popularity. Even his servants loved him. His valet, James E. Amos, wrote a book about him entitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero to His Valet. In that book Amos relates this illuminating incident:

My wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite. She had never seen one and he described it to her fully. Sometime later, the telephone at our cottage rang. [Amos and his wife lived in a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate at Oyster Bay. ] My wife answered it and it was Mr. Roosevelt himself. He had called her, he said, to tell her that there was a bobwhite outside her window and that if she would look out she might see it. Little things like that were so characteristic of him. Whenever he went by our cottage, even though we were out of sight, we would hear him call out:“Oo—oo—oo, Annie?”or“Oo—oo—oo, James!”It was just a friendly greeting as he went by.

How could employees keep from liking a man like that? How could anyone keep from liking him?

Roosevelt called at the White House one day when the President and Mrs. Taft were away. His honest liking for humble people was shown by the fact that he greeted all the old White House servants by name, even the scullery maids.

“When he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,”writes Archie Butt,“he asked her if she still made corn bread. Alice told him that she sometimes made it for the servants, but no one ate it upstairs.

“‘They show bad taste,’Roosevelt boomed,‘and I'll tell the President so when I see him.’

“Alice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went over to the office eating it as he went and greeting gardeners and laborers as he passed.…

“He addressed each person just as he had addressed them in the past. Ike Hoover, who had been head usher at the White House for forty years, said with tears in his eyes:‘It is the only happy day we had in nearly two years, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar bill.’”

The same concern for the seemingly unimportant people helped sales representative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of Chatham, New Jersey, retain an account.“Many years ago,”he reported,“I called on customers for Johnson and Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One account was a drugstore in Hingham. Whenever I went into this store I would always talk to the soda clerk and sales clerk for a few minutes before talking to the owner to obtain his order. One day I went up to the owner of the store, and he told me to leave as he was not interested in buying J&J products anymore because he felt they were concentrating their activities on food and discount stores to the detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my tail between my legs and drove around the town for several hours. Finally, I decided to go back and try at least to explain our position to the owner of the store.

“When I returned I walked in and as usual said hello to the soda clerk and sales clerk. When I walked up to the owner, he smiled at me and welcomed me back. He then gave me double the usual order. I looked at him with surprise and asked him what had happened since my visit only a few hours earlier. He pointed to the young man at the soda fountain and said that after I had left, the boy had come over and said that I was one of the few salespeople that called on the store that even bothered to say hello to him and to the others in the store. He told the owner that if any salesperson deserved his business, it was I. The owner agreed and remained a loyal customer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested in other people is a most important quality for a salesperson to possess—for any person, for that matter.”

I have discovered from personal experience that one can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them. Let me illustrate.

Years ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and we wanted such distinguished and busy authors as kathleen Norris, Fannie Hurst, Ida Tarbell, Albert Payson Terhune and Rupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and give us the benefit of their experiences. So we wrote them, saying we admired their work and were deeply interested in getting their advice and learning the secrets of their success.

Each of these letters was signed by about a hundred and fifty students. We said we realized that these authors were busy—too busy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed a list of questions for them to answer about themselves and their methods of work. They liked that. Who wouldn't like it? So they left their homes and traveled to Brooklyn to give us a helping hand.

By using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M. Shaw, secretary of the treasury in Theodore Roosevelt's cabinet; George W. Wickersham, attor ney general in Taft's cabinet; William Jennings Bryan; Franklin D. Roosevelt and many other prominent men to come to talk to the students of my courses in public speaking.

All of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a king upon his throne—all of us like people who admire us. Take the German Kaiser, for example. At the close of World War I he was probably the most savagely and universally despised man on this earth. Even his own nation turned against him when he fled over into Holland to save his neck. The hatred against him was so intense that millions of people would have loved to tear him limb from limb or burn him at the stake. In the midst of all this forest fire of fury, one little boy wrote the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with kindliness and admiration. This little boy said that no matter what the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm as his Emperor. The Kaiser was deeply touched by his letter and invited the little boy to come to see him. The boy came, so did his mother—and the Kaiser married her. That little boy didn't need to read a book on how to win friends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.

If we want to make friends, let's put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness. When the Duke of Windsor was Prince of Wales, he was scheduled to tour South America, and before he started out on that tour he spent months studying Spanish so that he could make public talks in the language of the country; and the South Americans loved him for it.

For years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of my friends. How? Although I haven't the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I began by asking the other party whether he believed the date of one's birth has anything to do with character and disposition. I then asked him or her to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she said November 24, for example, I kept repeating to myself,“November 24, November 24.”The minute my friend's back was turned, I wrote down the name and birthday and later would transfer it to a birthday book. At the beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates scheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my attention automatically. When the natal day arrived, there was my letter or telegram. What a hit it made! I was frequently the only person on earth who remembered.

If we want to make friends, let's greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the same psychology. Say“Hello”in tones that bespeak how pleased you are to have the person call. Many companies train their telephone operators to greet all callers in a tone of voice that radiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is concerned about them. Let's remember that when we answer the telephone tomorrow.

Showing a genuine interest in others not only wins friends for you, but may develop in its customers a loyalty to your company. In an issue of the publication of the National Bank of North America of New York, the following letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor, was published:

I would like you to know how much I appreciate your staff. Everyone is so courteous, polite and helpful. What a pleasure it is, after waiting on a long line, to have the teller greet you pleasantly.

Last year my mother was hospitalized for five months. Frequently I went to Marie Petrucello, a teller. She was concerned about my mother and inquired about her progress.

Is there any doubt that Mrs. Rosedale will continue to use this bank?

Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York City, was assigned to prepare a confidential report on a certain corporation. He knew of only one person who possessed the facts he needed so urgently. As Mr. Walters was ushered into the president's office, a young woman stuck her head through a door and told the president that she didn't have any stamps for him that day.

“I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son,”the president explained to Mr. Walters.

Mr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions. The president was vague, general, nebulous. He didn't want to talk, and apparently nothing could persuade him to talk. The interview was brief and barren.

“Frankly, I didn't know what to do,”Mr. Walters said as he related the story to the class.“Then I remembered what his secretary had said to him—stamps, twelve-year-old son.…And I also recalled that the foreign department of our bank collected stamps—stamps taken from letters pouring in from every continent washed by the seven seas.

“The next afternoon I called on this man and sent in word that I had some stamps for his boy. Was I ushered in with enthusiasm? Yes sir. He couldn't have shaken my hand with more enthusiasm if he had been running for Congress. He radiated smiles and good will.‘My George will love this one,’he kept saying as he fondled the stamps.‘And look at this! This is a treasure.’

“We spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at a picture of his boy, and he then devoted more than an hour of his time to giving me every bit of information I wanted—without my even suggesting that he do it. He told me all he knew, and then called in his subordinates and questioned them. He telephone some of his associates. He loaded me down with facts, figures, reports and correspondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters, I had a scoop.”

Here is another illustration:

C. M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years to sell fuel to a large chain—store organization. But the chain-store company continued to purchase its fuel from an out-of-town dealer and haul it right past the door of Knaphle's office. Mr. Knaphle made a speech one night before one of my classes, pouring out his hot wrath upon chain stores, branding them as a curse to the nation.

And still he wondered why he couldn't sell them.

I suggested that he try different tactics. To put it briefly, this is what happened. We staged a debate between members of the course on whether the spread of the chain store is doing the country more harm than good.

Knaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he agreed to defend the chain stores, and then went straight to an executive of the chain-store organization that he despised and said:“I am not here to try to sell fuel. I have come to ask you to do me a favor.”He then told about his debate and said,“I have come to you for help because I can't think of anyone else who would be more capable of giving me the facts I want. I'm anxious to win this debate, and I'll deeply appreciate whatever help you can give me.”

Here is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle's own words:

I had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time. It was with that understanding that he consented to see me. After I had stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and talked to me for exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes. He called in another executive who had written a book on chain stores. He wrote to the National Chain Store Association and secured for me a copy of a debate on the subject. He feels that the chain store is rendering a real service to humanity. He is proud of what he is doing for hundreds of communities. His eyes fairly glowed as he talked, and I must confess that he opened my eyes to things I had never even dreamed of. He changed my whole mental attitude.

As I was leaving, he walked with me to the door, put his arm around my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and asked me to stop in and see him again and let him know how I made out. The last words he said to me were:“Please see me again later in the spring. I should like to place an order with you for fuel.”

To me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to buy fuel without my even suggesting it. I had made more headway in two hours by becoming genuinely interested in him and his problems than I could have made in ten years trying to get him interested in me and my product.

You didn't discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a long time ago, a hundred years before Christ was born, a famous old Roman poet, Publilius Syrus, remarked:“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”

A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way street— both parties benefit.

Martin Ginsberg, who took our course in Long Island, New York, reported how the special interest a nurse took in him profoundly affected his life:

“It was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I was in a welfare ward of a city hospital and was scheduled to undergo major orthopedic surgery the next day. I Knew that I could only look forward to months of confinement, convalescence and pain. My father was dead; my mother and I lived alone in a small apartment and we were on welfare. My mother was unable to visit me that day.

“As the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the feeling of loneliness, despair and fear. I knew my mother was home alone worrying about me, not having anyone to be with, not having anyone to eat with and not even having enough money to afford a Thanksgiving Day dinner.

“The tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head under the pillow and pulled the covers over it. I cried silently, but so bitterly, so much that my body racked with pain.

“A young student nurse heard my sobbing and came over to me. She took the covers off my face and started wiping my tears. She told me how lonely she was, having to work that day and not being able to be with her family. She asked me whether I would have dinner with her. She brought two trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and ice cream for dessert. She talked to me and tried to calm my fears. Even though she was scheduled to go off duty at 4 P. M., she stayed on her own time until almost 11 P. M. She played games with me, talked to me and stayed with me until I finally fell asleep.

“Many Thanksgivings have come and gone since I was ten, but one never passes without me remembering that particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear, loneliness and the warmth and tenderness of the stranger that somehow made it all bearable.”




If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in mind:

BECOME GENUINELY INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE.





Chapter 9　The Big Secret of Dealing with People


There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.

Remember, there is no other way.

Of course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by sticking a revolver in his ribs. You can make your employees give you cooperation—until your back is turned—by threatening to fire them. You can make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But these crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.

The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.

What do you want?

Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.

John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is“the desire to be important.”Remember that phrase:“the desire to be important.”It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book.

What do you want? Not many things, but the few things that you do wish, you crave with an insistence that will not be denied. Some of the things most people want include:

1. Health and the preservation of life.

2. Food.

3. Sleep.

4. Money and the things money will buy.

5. Life in the hereafter.

6. Sexual gratification.

7. The well-being of our children.

8. A feeling of importance.

Almost all these wants are usually gratified—all except one. But there is one longing—almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleep—which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls“the desire to be great.”It is what Dewey calls the“desire to be important.”

Lincoln once began a letter saying:“Everybody likes a compliment.”William James said:“The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”He didn't speak, mind you, of the“wish”or the“desire”or the“longing”to be appreciated. He said the“craving”to be appreciated.

Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare individual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger will hold people in the palm of his or her hand and“even the undertaker will be sorry when he dies.”

The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing differences between mankind and the animals. To illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in Missouri, my father bred fine Duroc-Jersey hogs and pedigreed white-faced cattle. We used to exhibit our hogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and livestock shows throughout the Middle West. We won first prizes by the score. My father pinned his blue ribbons on a sheet of white muslin, and when friends or visitors came to the house, he would get out the long sheet of muslin. He would hold one end and I would hold the other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.

The hogs didn't care about the ribbons they had won. But Father did. These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.

If our ancestors hadn't had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance, civilization would have been impossible. Without it, we should have been just about like animals.

It was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an uneducated, poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study some law books he found in the bottom of a barrel of household plunder that he had bought for fifty cents. You have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name was Lincoln.

It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens to write his immortal novels. This desire inspired Sir Christopher Wren to design his symphonies in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass millions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest family in your town build a house far too large for its requirements.

This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cars, and talk about your brilliant children.

It is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and engaging in criminal activities. The average young criminal, according to E. P. Mulrooney, onetime police commissioner of New York, is filled with ego, and his first request after arrest is for those lurid newspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable prospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can gloat over his likeness sharing space with pictures of sports figures, movie and TV stars and politicians.

If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you. For example, John D. Rockefeller got his feeling of importance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in Peking, China, to care for millions of poor people whom he had never seen and never would see. Dillinger, on the other hand, got his feeling of importance by being a bandit, a bank robber and killer. When the FBI agents were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse up in Minnesota and said,“I'm Dillinger!”He was proud of the fact that he was Public Enemy Number One.“I'm not going to hurt you, but I'm Dillinger!”he said.

Yes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and Rockefeller is how they got their feeling of importance.

History sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling for a feeling of importance. Even George Washington wanted to be called“His Mightiness, the President of the United States”; and Columbus pleaded for the title“Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of India.”Catherine the Great refused to open letters that were not addressed to“Her Imperial Majesty”; and Mrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs. Grant like a tigress and shouted,“How dare you be seated in my presence until I invite you!”

Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd's expedition to the Antarctic in 1928 with the understanding that ranges of icy mountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to have nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even Shakespeare, mightiest of the mighty, tried to add luster to his name by procuring a coat of arms for his family.

People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance. For example, take Mrs. McKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her husband, the President of the United States, to neglect important affairs of state while he reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his arm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing desire for attention by insisting that he remain with her while she was having her teeth fixed, and once created a stormy scene when he had to leave her alone with the dentist while he kept an appointment with John Hay, his secretary of state.

The writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright, vigorous young woman who became an invalid in order to get a feeling of importance.“One day,”said Mrs. Rinehart,“this woman had been obliged to face something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were stretching ahead and there was little left for her to anticipate.

“She took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother traveled to the third floor and back, carrying trays, nursing her. Then one day the old mother, weary with service, lay down and died. For some weeks, the invalid languished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and resumed living again.”

Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. There are more patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases combined.

What is the cause of insanity?

Nobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that certain diseases, such as syphilis, break down and destroy the brain cells and result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all mental diseases can be attributed to such physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and injuries. But the other half—and this is the appalling part of the story—the other half of the people who go insane apparently have nothing organically wrong with their brain cells. In post-mortem examinations, when their brain tissues are studied under the highest-powered microscopes, these tissues are found to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine.

Why do these people go insane?

I put that question to the head physician of one of our most important psychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who has received the highest honors and the most coveted awards for his knowledge of this subject, told me frankly that he didn't know why people went insane. Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he told me this story:

“I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual gratification, children and social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes. Her husband didn't love her. He refused even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his room upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She went insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her husband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes she has married into English aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith.

“And as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child every night. Each time I call on her she says:‘Doctor, I had a baby last night.’”

Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing and winds singing through the masts.

Tragic? Oh, I don't know. Her physician said to me:“If I could stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn't do it. She's much happier as she is.”

If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.

One of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of over a million dollars a year (when there was no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a week was considered well off ) was Charles Schwab. He had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the first president of the newly formed United States Steel Company in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight years old. (Schwab later left U. S. Steel to take over the then-troubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt it into one of the most profitable companies in America. )

Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than three thousand dollars a day, to Charles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab was a genius? No. Because he knew more about the manufacture of steel than other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab told me himself that he had many men working for him who knew more about the manufacture of steel than he did.

Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people. I asked him how he did it. Here is his secret set down in his own words—words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung in every home and school, every shop and office in the land—words that children ought to memorize instead of wasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil— words that will all but transform your life and mine if we will only live them:

“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,”said Schwab,“the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.

“There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”

That is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact opposite. If they don't like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old couple says:“Once I did bad and that I heard ever. Twice I did good, but that I heard never.”

“In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world,”Schwab declared,“I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”

That he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the phenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie praised his associates publicly as well as privately.

Carnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone. He wrote an epitaph for himself which read:“Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself.”

Sincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first John D. Rockefeller's success in handling men. For example, when one of his partners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad buy in South America, John D. might have criticized; but he knew Bedford had done his best—and the incident was closed. So Rockefeller found something to praise; he congratulated Bedford because he had been able to save 60 percent of the money he had invested.“That's splendid,”said Rockefeller.“We don't always do as well as that upstairs.”

I have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but it illustrates a truth, so I'll repeat it:

According to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy day's work, set before her menfolks a heaping pile of hay. And when they indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied:“Why, how did I know you'd notice? I've been cooking for you men for the last twenty years and in all that time I ain't heard no word to let me know you wasn't just eating hay.”

When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was“lack of appreciation.”And I'd bet that a similar study made of runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.

A member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife. She and a group of other women in her church were involved in a self-improvement program. She asked her husband to help her by listing six things he believed she could do to help her become a better wife. He reported to the class:“I was surprised by such a request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I would like to change about her—my heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she would like to change about me—but I didn't. I said to her,‘Let me think about it and give you an answer in the morning.’

“The next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had them send six red roses to my wife with a note saying:‘I can't think of six things I would like to change about you. I love you the way you are.’

“When I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me at the door? That's right. My wife! She was almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as she had requested.

“The following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results of her assignment, several women with whom she had been studying came up to me and said,‘That was the most considerate thing I have ever heard.’It was then I realized the power of appreciation.”

Florenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled Broadway, gained his reputation by his subtle ability to“glorify the American girl.”Time after time, he took drab little creatures that no one ever looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into glamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing the value of appreciation and confidence, he made women feel beautiful by the sheer power of his gallantry and consideration. He was practical: he raised the salary of chorus girls from thirty dollars week to as high as one hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous; on opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams to the stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the show with American Beauty roses.

I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating. It wasn't difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as you know, people who would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.

When Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the leading role in Reunion in Vienna, he said,“There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.”

We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of the morning stars.

Paul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts,“The Rest of the Story,”told how showing sincere appreciation can change a person's life. He reported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to help her find a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated fact that nature had given Stevie something no one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a remarkable pair of ears to compensate for his blind eyes. But this was really the first time Stevie had been shown appreciation for those talented ears. Now, years later, he says that this act of appreciation was the beginning of a new life. You see, from that time on he developed his gift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage name of Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and songwriters of the seventies.(1)

Some readers are saying right now as they read these lines:“Oh, phooey! Flattery! Bear oil! I've tried that stuff. It doesn't work—not with intelligent people.”

Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.

Even Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli confessed that he put it on thick in dealing with the Queen. To use his exact words, he said he“spread it on with a trowel.”But Disraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit men who ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was a genius in his line. What would work for him wouldn't necessarily work for you and me. In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.

The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.

I recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro Obregon in the Chapultepec palace in Mexico City. Below the bust are carved these wise words from General Obregon's philosophy:“Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.”

No! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it. I'm talking about a new way of life. Let me repeat. I am talking about a new way of life.

King George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of his study at Buckingham Palace. One of these maxims said:“Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise.”That's all flattery is—cheap praise. I once read a definition of flattery that may beworth repeating:“Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.”

“Use what language you will,”said Ralph Waldo Emerson,“you can never say anything but what you are.”

If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we should all be experts in human relations.

When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the other person's good points, we won't have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth.

One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation. Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse. Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval.

The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.

Every minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the discouragement of pouring himself or herself out to an audience and not receiving a single ripple of appreciative comment. What applies to professionals applies doubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our families and friends. In our interpersonal relations we should never forget that all our associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy.

Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.

Pamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her responsibilities on her job the supervision of a janitor who was doing a very poor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the hallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive time was being lost in the shop.

Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person. She noticed that occasionally he did a particularly good piece of work. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the other people. Each day the job he did all around got better, and pretty soon he started doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an excellent job and other people give him appreciation and recognition. Honest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed.

Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for. There is an old saying that I have cut out and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but see it every day:

I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.

Emerson said:“Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”

If that was true of Emerson, isn't it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let's cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let's try to figure out the other person's good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be“hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,”and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you have forgotten them.




GIVE HONEST AND SINCERE APPRECIATION.

Chapter 10　How to Make People Like You Instantly


I was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third Street and Eighth Avenue in New York. I noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job—weighing envelopes, handing out stamps, making change, issuing receipts—the same monotonous grind year after year. So I said to myself:“I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about him.”So I asked myself,“What is there about him that I can honestly admire?”That is sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers; but, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something I admired no end.

So while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm:“I certainly wish I had your head of hair.”

He looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles.“Well, it isn't as good as it used to be,”he said modestly. I assured him that although it might have lost some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it was still magnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a pleasant little conversation and the last thing he said to me was:“Many people have admired my hair.”

I'll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I'll bet he went home that night and told his wife about it. I'll bet he looked in the mirror and said:“It is a beautiful head of hair.”

I told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards:“What did you want to get out of him?”

What was I trying to get out of him! ! ! What was I trying to get out of him! ! !

If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return—if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.

Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his being able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory long after the incident is past.

There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said:“The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself.

Philosophers have been speculating on the rules of human relationships for thousands of years, and out of all that speculation, there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as old as history. Zoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China twenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of Hinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries ago. Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world:“Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”

You want to approval of those with whom you come in contact. You want recognition of your true worth. You want a feeling that you are important in your little world. You don't want to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it,“hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise.”All of us want that.

So let's obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would have others give unto us.

How? When? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.

David G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes how he handled a delicate situation when he was asked to take charge of the refreshment booth at a charity concert.

“The night of the concert I arrived at the park and found two elderly ladies in a very bad humor standing next to the refreshment stand. Apparently each thought that she was in charge of this project. As I stood there pondering what to do, one of the members of the sponsoring committee appeared and handed me a cash box and thanked me for taking over the project. She introduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran off.

“A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box was a symbol of authority (of sorts), I gave the box to Rose and explained that I might not be able to keep the money straight and that if she took care of it I would feel better. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers who had been assigned to refreshments how to operate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible for that part of the project.

“The evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting the money, Jane supervising the teenagers, and me enjoying the concert.”

You don't have to wait until you are ambassador to France or chairman of the Clambake Committee of your lodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost every day.

If, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we have ordered French fried, let's say:“I'm sorry to trouble you, but I prefer French fried.”She'll probably reply,“No trouble at all”and will be glad to change the potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.

Little phrases such as“I'm sorry to trouble you,”“Would you be so kind as to —?”“Won't you please?”“Would you mind?”“Thank you.”—little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life—and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.

Let's take another illustration, Hall Caine's novels—The Christian, The Deemster, The Manxman, among them—were all best-sellers in the early part of this century. Millions of people read his novels, countless millions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had more than eight years' schooling in his life; yet when he died he was the richest literary man of his time.

The story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so he devoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of Rossetti's artistic achievement—and sent a copy to Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted.“Any young man who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,”Rossetti probably said to himself,“must be brilliant.”So Rossetti invited this blacksmith's son to come to London and act as his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall Caine's life; for, in his new position, he met the literary artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that emblazoned his name across the sky.

His home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for tourists from the far corners of the world, and he left a multimillion dollar estate. Yet—who knows—he might have died poor and unknown had he not written an essay expressing his admiration for a famous man.

Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation.

Rossetti considered himself important. That is not strange. Almost everyone considers himself important, very important.

The life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel important. Ronald J. Rowland, who is one of the instructors of our course in California, is also a teacher of arts and crafts. He wrote to us about a student named Chris in his beginning-crafts class:

Chris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the kind of student that often does not receive the attention he deserves. I also teach an advanced class that had grown to be somewhat of a status symbol and a privilege for a student to have earned the right to be in it.

On Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk. I really felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked Chris if he would like to be in the advanced class. How I wish I could express the look in Chris's face, the emotions in that shy fourteen-year-old boy, trying to hold back his tears.

“Who me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?”

“Yes, Chris, you are good enough.”

I had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my eyes. As Chris walked out of class that day, seemingly two inches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a positive voice,“Thank you, Mr. Rowland.”

Chris taught me a lesson I will never forget—our deep desire to feel important. To help me never forget this rule, I made a sign which reads“YOU ARE IMPORTANT.”This sign hangs in the front of the classroom for all to see and to remind me that each student I face is equally important.




The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.

Remember what Emerson said:“Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”

And the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least justification for a feeling of achievement bolster up their egos by a show of tumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare put it:“… man, proud man, / Drest in a little brief authority, /…Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, /As make the angels weep.”

I am going to tell you how business people in my own courses have applied these principles with remarkable results. Let's take the case of a Connecticut attorney (because of his relatives he prefers not to have his name mentioned).

Shortly, after joining the course, Mr. R— drove to Long Island with his wife to visit some of her relatives. She left him to chat with an old aunt of hers and then rushed off by herself to visit some of the younger relatives. Since he soon had to give a speech professionally on how he applied the principles of appreciation, he thought he would gain some worthwhile experience talking with the elderly lady. So he looked around the house to see what he could honestly admire.

“This house was built about 1890, wasn't it?”he inquired.

“Yes,”she replied,“that is precisely the year it was built.”

“It reminds me of the house I was born in,”he said.“It's beautiful. Well built. Roomy. You know, they don't build houses like this anymore.”

“You're right,”the old lady agreed.“The young folks nowadays don't care for beautiful homes. All they want is a small apartment, and then they go off gadding about in their automobiles.

“This is a dream house,”she said in a voice vibrating with tender memories.“This house was built with love. My husband and I dreamed about it for years before we built it. We didn't have an architect. We planned it all ourselves.”

She showed Mr. R— about the house, and he expressed his hearty admiration for the beautiful treasures she had picked up in her travels and cherished over a lifetime—paisley shawls, an old English tea set, Wedgwood china, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings, and silk draperies that had once hung in a French chateau.

After showing Mr. R— through the house, she took him out to the garage. There, jacked up on blocks, was a Packard car—in mint condition.

“My husband bought that car for me shortly before he passed on,”she said softly.“I have never ridden in it since his death...You appreciate nice things, and I'm going to give this car to you.”

“Why, aunty,”he said,“you overwhelm me. I appreciate your generosity, of course; but I couldn't possibly accept it. I'm not even a relative of yours. I have a new car, and you have many relatives that would like to have that Packard.”

“Relatives!”she exclaimed.“Yes, I have relatives who are just waiting till I die so they can get that car. But they are not going to get it.”

“If you don't want to give it to them, you can very easily sell it to a secondhand dealer,”he told her.

“Sell it!”she cried.“Do you think I would sell this car? Do you think I could stand to see strangers riding up and down the street in that car— that car that my husband bought for me? I wouldn't dream of selling it. I'm going to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful things.”

He tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn't without hurting her feelings.

This lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley shawls, her French antiques, and her memories, was starving for a little recognition. She had once been young and beautiful and sought after. She had once built a house warm with love and had collected things from all over Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated loneliness of old age, she craved a little human warmth, a little genuine appreciation—and no one gave it to her. And when she found it, like a spring in the desert, her gratitude couldn't adequately express itself with anything less than the gift of her cherished Packard.

Let's take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who was superintendent of Lewis and Valentine, nurserymen and landscape architects in Rye, New York, related this incident.

“Shortly after I attended the talk on‘How to Win Friends and Influence People.’I was Landscaping the estate of a famous attorney. The owner came out to give me a few instructions about where he wished to plant a mass of rhododendrons and azaleas.

“I said,‘Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I've been admiring your beautiful dogs. I understand you win a lot of blue ribbons every year at the show in Madison Square Garden.’

“The effect of this little expression of appreciation was striking.

“‘Yes,’the judge replied,‘I do have a lot of fun with my dogs. Would you like to see my kennel?’

“He spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and the prizes they had won. He even brought out their pedigrees and explained about the bloodlines responsible for such beauty and intelligence.

“Finally, turning to me, he asked:‘Do you have any small children?’

“‘Yes, I do,’I replied,‘I have a son.’

“‘Well, wouldn't he like a puppy?’the judge inquired.

“‘Oh, yes, he'd be tickled pink.’

“‘All right, I'm going to give him one,’the judge announced.

“He started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he paused.‘You'll forget it if I tell you. I'll write it out.’So the judge went in the house, typed out the pedigree and feeding instructions, and gave me a puppy worth several hundred dollars and one hour and fifteen minutes of his valuable time largely because I had expressed my honest admiration for his hobby and achievements.”

George Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent film that made motion pictures possible, amassed a fortune of a hundred million dollars, and made himself one of the most famous businessmen on earth. Yet in spite of all these tremendous accomplishments, he craved little recognitions even as you and I.

To illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman School of Music and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester, James Adamson, then president of the Superior Seating Company of New York, wanted to get the order to supply the theater chairs for these buildings. Phoning the architect, Mr. Adamson made an appointment to see Mr. Eastman in Rochester.

When Adamson arrived, the architect said:“I know you want to get this order, but I can tell you right now that you won't stand a ghost of a show if you take more than five minutes of George Eastman's time. He is a strict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story quickly and get out.”

Adamson was prepared to do just that.

When he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman bending over a pile of papers at his desk. Presently, Mr. Eastman looked up, removed his glasses, and walked toward the architect and Mr. Adamson, saying:“Good morning, gentlemen, what can I do for you?”

The architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson said:“While we've been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman, I've been admiring your office. I wouldn't mind working in a room like this myself. I'm in the interior-woodworking business, and I never saw a more beautiful office in all my life.”

George Eastman replied:“You remind me of something I had almost forgotten. It is beautiful, isn't it? I enjoyed it a great deal when it was first built. But I come down here now with a lot of other things on my mind and sometimes don't even see the room for weeks at a time.”

Adamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel.“This is English oak, isn't it? A little different texture from Italian oak.”

“Yes,”Eastman replied.“Imported English oak. It was selected for me by a friend who specializes in fine woods.”

Then Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the proportions, the coloring, the hand carving and other effects he had helped to plan and execute.

While drifting about the room, admiring the woodwork, they paused before a window, and George Eastman, in his modest, soft-spoken way, pointed out some of the institutions through which he was trying to help humanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital, the Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home, the Children's Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated him warmly on the idealistic way he was using his wealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently, George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out the first camera he had ever owned—an invention he had bought from an Englishman.

Adamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get started in business, and Mr. Eastman spoke with real feeling about the poverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed mother had kept a boardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The terror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he resolved to make enough money so that his mother wouldn't have to work. Mr. Adamson drew him out with further questions and listened, absorbed, while he related the story of his experiments with dry photographic plates. He told how he had worked in an office all day, and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief naps while the chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two hours at a stretch.

James Adamson had been ushered into Eastman's office at ten-fifteen and had been warned that he must not take more than five minutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they were still talking.

Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said,“The last time I was in Japan I bought some chairs, brought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the other day and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself. Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do painting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have lunch with me and I'll show you.”

After lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had brought from Japan. They weren't worth more than a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because he himself had painted them.

The order for the seats amounted to $90, 000. Who do you suppose got the order—James Adamson or one of his competitors?

From the time of this story until Mr. Eastman's death, he and James Adamson were close friends.

Claude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this principle and saved his restaurant the loss of a key employee. This woman had been in his employ for five years and was a vital link between M. Marais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive a registered letter from her advising him of her resignation.

M. Marais reported:“I was very surprised and, even more, disappointed, because I was under the impression that I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend as well as an employee, I probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe was even more demanding of her than of other employees.

“I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some explanation. I took her aside and said,‘Paulette, you must understand that I cannot accept your resignation. You mean a great deal to me and to this company, and you are as important to the success of this restaurant as I am.’I repeated this in front of the entire staff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated my confidence in her with my family present.

“Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as never before. I frequently reinforce this by expressing my appreciation for what she does and showing her how important she is to me and to the restaurant.”




“Talk to people about themselves,”said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire.“Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.”

MAKE THE OTHER PERSON FEEL IMPORTANT—AND DO IT SINCERELY.





Chapter 11　“He Who Can Do This Has the Whole World with Him. He Who Cannot Walks a Lonely Way”


I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn't think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said:“Wouldn't you like to have that?”

Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?

That is what Lloyd George, Great Britain's Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone asked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leaders—Wilson, Orlando and Clemenceau—had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any one thing, it would be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.

Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absured. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.

So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

Remember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do something. If, for example, you don't want your children to smoke, don't preach at them, and don't talk about what you want; but show them that cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the hundered-yard dash.

This is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are dealing with children or calves or chimpanzees. For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they made the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the calf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and stubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn't write essays and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought of what the calf wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf's mouth and let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.

Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted something. How about the time you gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the rule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a beautiful, unselfish, divine act.“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”

If you hadn't wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money, you would not have made the contribution. Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a customer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution because you wanted something.

Harry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human Behavior said:“Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire… and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: first, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”

Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally gave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the other person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how to handle people.

To illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they were so busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother's frantic letters.

Then Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail, without even asking for it. Someone called his bet; so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a postscript that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.

He neglected, however, to enclose the money.

Back came replies by return mail thanking“Dear Uncle Andrew”for his kind note and—you can finish the sentence yourself.

Another example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our course. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan's normal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he'd just better make up his mind to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought,“If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?”He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action.“We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate.‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand—telling him all the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair.‘What are you doing here?’I asked.‘I'm waiting to go to kindergarten. I don't want to be late.’The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.”

Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself:“How can I make this person want to do it?”

That question will stop us from rushing into a situation needlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.

At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures.

At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all announcements had been made.

Naturally, I didn't want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I wanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager.

“I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,”I said,“but I don't blame you at all. If I had been in your position, I should probably have written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all the profit possible. If you don't do that, you will be fired and you ought to be fired. Now, let's take a piece of paper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase in rent.”

Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column“Advantages”and the other column“Disadvantages.”

I wrote down under the head“Advantages”these words:“Ballroom free.”Then I went on to say:“You will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage, for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights during the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you.

“Now, let's consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing your income from me, you are going to decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place.

“There's another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract crowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn't it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars advertising in the newspapers, you couldn't bring as many people to look at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel, isn't it?”

As I talked, I wrote these two“disadvantages”under the proper heading, and handed the sheet of paper to the manager, saying:“I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.”

I received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent.

Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he could get it.

Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had stormed into his office and said,“What do you mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the announcements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculоus! Absurd! I won't pay it!”

What would have happened then? An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter—and you know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it difficult for him to back down and give in.

Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships.“If there is any one secret of success,”said Henry Ford,“it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.”

That is so good, I want to repeat it:“If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.”

That is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it at a glance; yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.

An example? Look at the letters that come across your desk tomorrow morning, and you will find that most of them violate this important canon of common sense. Take this one, a letter written by the head of the radio department of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the managers of local radio stations throughout the country. (I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each paragraph. )

Mr. John Blank,

Blankville,

Indiana

Dear Mr. Blank:




The——company desires to retain its position in advertising agency leadership in the radio field.

[Who cares what your company desires? I am worried about my own problems. The bank is foreclosing the mortgage on my house, the bugs are destroying the hollyhocks, the stock market tumbled yesterday. I missed the eight-fifteen this morning, I wasn't invited to the Jones's dance last night, the doctor tells me I have high blood pressure and neuritis and dandruff. And then what happens? I come down to the office this morning worried, open my mail and here is some little whippersnapper off in New York yapping about what his company wants. Bah! If he only realized what sort of impression his letter makes, he would get out of the advertising business and start manufacturing sheep dip. ]

This agency's national advertising accounts were the bulwark of the network. Our subsequent clearances of station time have kept us at the top of agencies year after year.

[You are big and rich and right at the top, are you? So what? I don't give two whoops in Hades if you are as big as General Motors and General Electric and the General Staff of the U. S. Army all combined. If you had as much sense as a half-witted hummingbird, you would realize that I am interested in how big I am—not how big you are. All this talk about your enormous success makes me feel small and unimportant. ]

We desire to service our accounts with the last word on radio station information.

[You desire! You desire. You unmitigated ass. I'm not interested in what you desire or what the President of the United States desires. Let me tell you once and for all that I am interested in what I desire—and you haven't said a word about that yet in this absurd letter of yours. ]

Will you, therefore, put the——company on your preferred list for weekly station information——every single detail that will be useful to an agency in intelligently booking time.

[“Preferred list.”You have your nerve! You make me feel insignificant by your big talk about your company—and then you ask me to put you on a“preferred”list, and you don't even say“please”when you ask it. ]

A prompt acknowledgment of this letter, giving us your latest“doings,”will be mutually helpful.

[You fool! You mail me a cheap form letter—a letter scattered far and wide like the autumn leaves—and you have the gall to ask me, when I am worried about the mortgage and the hollyhocks and my blood pressure, to sit down and dictate a personal note acknowledging your form letter—and you ask me to do it“promptly.”What do you mean,“promptly”? Don't you know I am just as busy as you are—or, at least, I like to think I am. And while we are on the subject, who gave you the lordly right to order me around? … You say it will be“mutually helpful.”At last, at last, you have begun to see my viewpoint. But you are vague about how it will be to my advantage. ]

Very truly yours,

John Doe

Manager Radio Department

P. S. The enclosed reprint from the Blankville Journal will be of interest to you, and you may want to broadcast it over your station.

[Finally, down here in the postscript, you mention something that may help me solve one of my problems. Why didn't you begin your letter with—but what's the use? Any advertising man who is guilty of perpetrating such drivel as you have sent me has something wrong with his medulla oblongata. You don't need a letter giving our latest doings. What you need is a quart of iodine in your thyroid gland. ]




Now, if people who devote their lives to advertising and who pose as experts in the art of influencing people to buy—if they write a letter like that, what can we expect from the butcher and baker or the auto mechanic?

Here is another letter, written by the superintendent of a large freight terminal to a student of this course, Edward Vermylen. What effect did this letter have on the man to whom it was addressed? Read it and then I'll tell you.

A. Zerega's Sons, Inc.

28 Front St.

Brooklyn, N. Y. 11201

Attention: Mr. Edward Vermylen




Gentlemen:

The operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are handicapped because a material percentage of the total business is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition results in congestion, overtime on the part of our forces, delays to trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On November 10, we received from your company a lot of 510 pieces, which reached here at 4:20 P. M.

We solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable effects arising from late receipt of freight. May we ask that, on days on which you ship the volume which was received on the above date, effort be made either to get the truck here earlier or to deliver us part of the freight during the morning?

The advantage that would accrue to you under such an arrangement would be that of more expeditious discharge of your trucks and the assurance that your business would go forward on the date of its receipt.

Very truly yours,

J—— B——, Supt.

After reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A. Zerega's Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the following comment:

This letter had the reverse effect from that which was intended. The letter begins by describing the Terminal's difficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking. Our cooperation is then requested without any thought as to whether it would inconvenience us, and then, finally, in the last paragraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do cooperate it will mean more expeditious discharge of our trucks with the assurance that our freight will go forward on the date of its receipt.

In other words, that in which we are most interested is mentioned last and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit of antagonism rather than of cooperation.

Let's see if we can't rewrite and improve this letter. Let's not waste any time talking about our problems. As Henry Ford admonishes, let's“get the other person's point of view and see things from his or her angle, as well as from our own.”

Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best way, but isn't it an improvement?

Mr. Edward Vermylen

A. Zerega's Sons, Inc.

28 Front St.

Brooklyn, N. Y. 11201




Dear Mr. Vermylen:

Your company has been one of our good customers for fourteen years. Naturally, we are very grateful for your patronage and are eager to give you the speedy, efficient service you deserve. However, we regret to say that it isn't possible for us to do that when your trucks bring us a large shipment late in the afternoon, as they did on November 10. Why? Because many other customers make late afternoon deliveries also. Naturally, that causes congestion. That means your trucks are held up unavoidably at the pier and sometimes even your freight is delayed.

That's bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your deliveries at the pier in the morning when possible, your trucks will be able to keep moving, your freight will get immediate attention, and our workers will get home early at night to enjoy a dinner of the delicious macaroni and noodles that you manufacture.

Regardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always cheerfully do all in our power to serve you promptly.

You are busy. Please don't trouble to answer this note.

Yours truly,

J——B——, Supt.

Barbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New York, desired to move to Phoenix, Arizona, because of the health of her son. Using the principles she had learned in our course, she wrote the following letter to twelve banks in Phoenix:

Dear Sir:

My ten years of bank experience should be of interest to a rapidly growing bank like yours.

In various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers Trust Company in New York, leading to my present assignment as Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all phases of banking including depositor relations, credits, loans and administration.

I will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can contribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix the week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help your bank meet its goals.

Sincerely,

Barbara L. Anderson

Do you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks invited her to be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank's offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and focused on their wants, not heryown.

Thousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why? Because they are always thinking only of what they want. They don't realize that neither you nor I want to buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems. And if salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won't need to sell us. We'll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying—not being sold.

Yet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing things from the customer's angle. For example, for many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes in the center of Greater New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I chanced to meet a realestate operator who had bought and sold property in that area for many years. He knew Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or not my stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn't know and told me what I already knew—that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills Garden Association. The following morning, I received a letter from him. Did he give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a telephone call. But he didn't. He told me again that I could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle my insurance.

He was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in helping himself.

J. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople from the same company handled the same type of situation. He reported:“Several years ago I was on the management team of a small company. Headquartered near us was the district office of a large insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our company was assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.

“One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just introduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later on and he would get back to us when he had more information on it.

“The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted:‘Hey Luke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.’He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an executive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day. (It was the same policy that Carl had casually mentioned. ) He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the coverage and ended saying,‘The policy is so new, I'm going to have someone from the home office come out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let's get the applications signed and on the way so he can have more information to work with.’His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still did not have details. When they were made available to us, they confirmed John's initial understanding of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our coverage.

“Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the policies.”

The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of America's great business leaders, once said:“People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”

If out of reading this book you get just one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.

Looking at the other person's point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson won by her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the example of John's sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.

Another example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes from Michael E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company. Mike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service station was holding him back. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape that sales were declining significantly.

This manager would not listen to any of Mike's pleas to upgrade the station. After many exhortations and heart-to-heart talks—all of which had no impact—Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest Shell station in his territory.

The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the next time, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the Number One spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn't helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager, by showing him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.

Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own minds function. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the young college graduates who were entering the employ of the Carrier Corporation, the large airconditioner manufacturer. One of the participants wanted to persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this is about what he said:“I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few times I've been to the gymnasium there haven't been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to throwing the ball around the other night—and I got a black eye. I wish all of you would come down tomorrow night. I want to play basketball.”

Did he talk about anything you want? You don't want to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes to, do you? You don't care about what he wants. You don't want to get a black eye.

Could he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep. Keener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball.

To repeat Professor Overstreet's wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

One of the students in the author's training course was worried about his little boy. The child was underweight and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and nagged.“Mother wants you to eat this and that.”“Father wants you to grow up to be a big man.”

Did the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy beach.

No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a father thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that. So he said to himself:“What does that boy want? How can I tie up what I want to what he wants?”

It was easy for the father when he started thinking about it. His boy had a tricycle that he loved to ride up and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully—a bigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it himself.

Naturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she would have to come out and take the bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again. This happened almost every day.

What did the little boy want? It didn't take a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one. His pride, his anger, his desire for a feeling of importance—all the strongest emotions in his makeup—goaded him to get revenge, to smash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat—when his father promised him that—there was no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach, sauerkraut, salt mackerel—anything in order to be big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so often.

After solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.

He slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet and say:“Look, Johnny, what you aid again last night.”

He would say:“No, I didn't do it. You did it.”

Scolding,spanking,shaming him,reiterating that the parents didn't want him to do it—none of these things kept the bed dry. So the parents asked:“How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?”

What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like Grandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn't object.

His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said:“Here is a little gentleman who would like to do some shopping.”

The salesgirl made him feel important by saying:“Young man, what can I show you?”

He stood a couple of inches taller and said:“I want to buy a bed for myself.”

When he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded to buy it.

The bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to the door shouting:“Daddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!”

The father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab's injunction: he was“hearty in his approbation and lavish in his praise.”

“You are not going to wet this bed, are you?”the father said.

“Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.”The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it. And he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.

Another father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn't get his three-year-old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. So the parents asked themselves:“How can we make her want to do it?”

The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put her on a chair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen while she was stirring the cereal and she said:“Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning.”

She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing because she was interested in it. She had achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.

William Winter once remarked that“self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.”Why can't we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.

Remember:“First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.”




AROUSE IN THE OTHER PERSON AN EAGER WANT.





Chapter 12　“If You Want to Gather Honey, Don't Kick over the Beehive”


On May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had ever known had come to its climax. After weeks of search,“Two Gun”Crowley—the killer, the gunman who didn't smoke or drink—was at bay, trapped in his sweetheart's apartment on West End Avenue.

One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideaway. They chopped holes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the“cop killer,”with tear gas. Then they mounted their machine guns on surrounding buildings and for more than an hour one of New York's fine residential areas reverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the tat-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an overstuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like it had ever been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.

When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York.“He will kill,”said the Commissioner,“at the drop of a feather.”

But how did“Two Gun”Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed“To whom it may concern.”And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In his letter Crowley said:“Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that would do nobody any harm.”

A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said:“Let me see your license.”

Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer's revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said:“Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that would do nobody any harm.”Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he say,“This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said:“This is what I get for defending myself.”

The point of the story is this:“Two Gun”Crowley didn't blame himself for anything.

Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:

“I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time,and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.”

That's Al Capone speaking. Yes, America's most notorious Public Enemy—the most sinister gang leader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn't condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public benefactor—an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.

And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of New York's most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he believed it.

I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York's infamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that“few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all.”

If Al Capone,“Two Gun”Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison walls don't blame themselves for anything—what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?

John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed:“I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”

Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for a third of a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.

Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.

Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said,“As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation.”

The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company. One of his responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove the hats.

He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.

You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a thousand pages of history. Take, for example, the famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and President Taft—a quarrel that split the Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and wrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War and altered the flow of history. Let's review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the White House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off to Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded. He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all but demolished the G. O. P. In the election that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican party carried only two states— Vermont and Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever known.

Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame himself? Of course not. With tears in his eyes, Taft said:“I don't see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”

Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don't know, and I don't care. The point I am trying to make is that all of Theodore Roosevelt's criticism didn't persuade Taft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes:“I don't see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”

Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing with indignation in the early 1920s. It rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men, nothing like it had ever happened before in American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding's cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome—oil reserves that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did Secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a“loan”of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into court—and blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.

Fall was condemned viciously—condemned as few men in public life have ever been. Did he repent? Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public speech that President Harding's death had been due to mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed:“What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband never betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one who has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified.”

There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves. We are all like that. So when you and I are tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let's remember Al Capone,“Two Gun”Crowley and Albert Fall. Let's realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let's realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say:“I don't see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”

On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging house directly across the street from Ford's Theater, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln's long body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur's famous painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.

As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said,“There lies the most perfect ruler of men that the world has ever seen.”

What was the secret of Lincoln's success in dealing with people? I studied the life of Abraham Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of three years to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I believe I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of Lincoln's personality and home life as it is possible for any being to make. I made a special study of Lincoln's method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in criticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote letters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the country roads where they were sure to be found. One of these letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.

Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in Springfield, Illinois, he attacked his opponents openly in letters published in the newspapers. But he did this just once too often.

In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by the name of James Shields. Lincoln lampooned him through an anonymous letter published in the Springfield Journal. The town roared with laughter. Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation. He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse, started after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel. Lincoln didn't want to fight. He was opposed to dueling, but he couldn't get out of it and save his honor. He was given the choice of weapons. Since he had very long arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the Mississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at the last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped the duel.

That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln's life. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.

Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the head of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn—McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade—blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned these incompetent generals, but Lincoln,“with malice toward none, with charity for all,”held his peace. One of his favorite quotations was“Judge not, that ye be not judged.”

And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied:“Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.”

Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln. Let's take just one illustration:

The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn't escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity—the opportunity to capture Lee's army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate action.

And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do. He called a council of war in direct violation of Lincoln's orders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the waters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.

Lincoln was furious.“What does this mean?”Lincoln cried to his son Robert.“Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him myself.”

In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter. And remember, at this period of his life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in 1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.

My dear General,

I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few—no more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.

What do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?

Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found among his papers after his death.

My guess is—and this is only a guess—that after writing that letter, Lincoln looked out of the window and said to himself,“Just a minute. Maybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of the wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn't be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade's timid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army.”

So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.

Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted with a perplexing problem, he used to lean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the White House and ask himself,“What would Lincoln do if he were in my shoes? How would he solve this problem?”

The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody, let's pull a five-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln's picture on the bill, and ask,“How would Lincoln handle this problem if he had it?”

Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned the paper brown. For example, he once wrote to a man who had aroused his ire:“The thing for you is a burial permit. You have only to speak and I will see that you get it.”On another occasion he wrote to an editor about a proofreader's attempts to“improve my spelling and punctuation.”He ordered:“Set the matter according to my copy hereafter and see that the proofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his decayed brain.”

The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better. They allowed him to blow off steam, and the letters didn't do any real harm, because Mark's wife secretly lifted them out of the mail. They were never sent.

Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it. But why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others—yes, and a lot less dangerous.“Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof,”said Confucius,“when your own doorstep is unclean.”

When I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard Harding Davis, an author who once loomed large on the literary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone with this notation at the bottom:“Dictated but not read.”I was quite impressed. I felt that the writer must be very big and busy and important. I wasn't the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note with the words:“Dictated but not read.”

He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me with this scribbled across the bottom:“Your bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.”True, I had blundered, and perhaps I deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented it so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still persisted in my mind—I am ashamed to admit—was the hurt he had given me.

If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticism—no matter how certain we are that it is justified.

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest novelists ever to enrich English literature, to give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.

Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success?“I will speak ill of no man,”he said,“…and speak all the good I know of everybody.”

Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do.

But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

“A great man shows his greatness,”said Carlyle,“by the way he treats little men.”

Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was returning to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly damaged although nobody was hurt.

Hoover's first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane's fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.

Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of three lives as well.

You can imagine Hoover's anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn't scold the mechanic; he didn't even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man's shoulder and said,“To show you I'm sure that you'll never do his again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.”

Often parents are tempted to criticize their children. You would expect me to say“don't.”But I will not. I am merely going to say,“Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism,‘Father Forgets.’”It originally appeared as an editorial in the People's Home Journal. We are reprinting it here with the author's permission, as condensed in the Reader's Digest:

“Father Forgets”is one of those little pieces which—dashed off in a moment of sincere feeling—strikes an echoing chord in so many readers as to become a perennial reprint favorite. Since its first appearance,“Father Forgets”has been reproduced, writes the author, W. Livingston Larned,“in hundreds of magazines and house organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign languages. I have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school, church, and lecture platforms. It has been‘on the air’on countless occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems mysteriously to‘click’. This one certainly did.”

FATHER FORGETS

W. Livingston Larned

Listen, son:

I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.

There are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.

At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called,“Goodbye, Daddy!”and I frowned, and said in reply,“Hold your shoulders back!”

Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive— and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!

Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door.“What is it you want?”I snapped.

You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.

Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding—this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.

And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!

It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual:“He is nothing but a boy—a little boy!”

I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.

Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.“To know all is to forgive all.”

As Dr. Johnson said:“God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.”

Why should you and I?

DON'T CRITICIZE, CONDEMN OR COMPLAIN.





Part Three　Find the Kind of Work in Which You May Be Happy and Successful





Chapter 13　A Sure Way of Making Enemies—and How to Avoid It


When Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed that if he could be right 75 percent of the time, he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.

If that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of the twentieth century could hope to obtain, what about you and me?

If you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. If you can't be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other people they are wrong?

You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in words—and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.

Never begin by announcing“I am going to prove so-and-so to you.”That's bad. That's tantamount to saying:“I'm smarter than you are. I'm going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.”

That is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before you even start.

It is difficult, under even the most begin conditions, to change people's minds. So why make it harder? Why handicap yourself?

If you are going to prove anything, don't let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope:

Men must be taught as if you taught them not

And things unknown proposed as things forgot.

Over three hundred years ago Galileo said:

You cannot teach a man anything;

you can only help him to find it within himself.

As Lord Chesterfield said to his son:

Be wiser than other people if you can;

but do not tell them so.

Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:

One thing only I know,

and that is that I know nothing.

Well, I can't hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are wrong. And I find that it pays.

If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong—yes, even that you know is wrong—isn't it better to begin by saying:“Well, now, look. I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let's examine the facts.”

There's magic, positive magic, in such phrases as:“I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let's examine the facts.”

Nobody in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to your saying:“I may be wrong. Let's examine the facts.”

One of our class members who used this approach in dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a Dodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile business, he was often hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers'complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of business and general unpleasantness.

He told his class:“Recognizing that this was getting me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I would say something like this:‘Our dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently ashamed. We may have erred in your case. Tell me about it.’

“This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer releases his feelings, he is usually much more reasonable when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me for having such an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In this highly competitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I believe that showing respect for all customers' opinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition.”

You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broadminded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.

If you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him or her so, what happens? Let me illustrate. Mr. S—, a young New York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the United States Supreme Court (Lustgarten V. Fleet Corporation 280 U. S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money and an important question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him:“The statute of limitations in admiralty law is six years, is it not?”

Mr. S— stopped, stared at the justice for a moment, and then said bluntly:“Your Honor, there is no statute of limitations in admiralty.”

“A hush fell on the court,”said Mr. S— as he related his experience to one of the author's classes,“and the temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice—was wrong. And I had told him so. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke better than I ever spoke before. But I didn't persuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and famous man that he was wrong.”

Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don't want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is from James Harvey Robinson's enlightening book The Mind in the Making.

We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened…The little word“my”is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is“my”dinner,“my”dog, and“my”house, or“my”father,“my”country, and“my”God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of“Epictetus,”of the medicina value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.

Carl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On Becoming a Person:

I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the other person. The way in which I have worded this statement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an evaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When someone expresses some feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately to feel“that's right,”or“that's stupid,”“that's abnormal,”“that's unreasonable,”“that's incorrect,”“that's not nice.”Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely what the meaning of the statement is to the other person.(1)

I once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for my home. When the bill arrived, I was dismayed.

A few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies. The price was mentioned, and she exclaimed with a note of triumph:“What? That's awful. I am afraid he put one over on you.”

True? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to truths that reflect on their judgment. So, being human, I tried to defend myself. I pointed out that the best is eventually the cheapest, that one can't expect to get quality and artistic taste at bargain-basement prices, and so on and on.

The next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies, bubbled over with enthusiasm, and expressed a wish that she could afford such exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was totally different.“Well, to tell the truth,”I said,“I can't afford them myself. I paid too much. I'm sorry I ordered them.”

When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.

Horace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time of the Civil War, disagreed violently with Lincoln's policies. He believed that he could drive Lincoln into agreeing with him by a campaign of argument, ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign month after month, year after year. In fact, he wrote a brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President Lincoln the night Booth shot him.

But did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at all. Ridicule and abuse never do.

If you want some excellent suggestions about dealing with people and managing yourself and improving your personality, read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography—one of the most fascinating life stories ever written, one of the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells how he conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and transformed himself into one of the most able, suave and diplomatic men in American history.

One day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old Quaker friend took him aside and lashed him with a few stinging truths, something like this:

Ben, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you. They have become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You know so much that no man can tell you anything. Indeed, no man is going to try, for the effort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to know any more than you do now, which is very little.

One of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he accepted that smarting rebuke. He was big enough and wise enough to realize that it was true, to sense that he was headed for failure and social disaster. So he made a right-about-face. He began immediately to change his insolent, opinionated ways.

“I made it a rule,”said Franklin,“to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiment of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion, such as‘certainly,’‘undoubtedly,’etc., and I adopted, instead of them,‘I conceive,’‘I apprehend,’or‘I imagine’a thing to be so or so, or‘it so appears to me at present.’When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appeared or seemed to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I proposed my opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.

“And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had earned so much weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.”

How do Ben Franklin's methods work in business? Let's take two examples.

Katherine A. Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an industrial engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing plant. She told one of our classes how she handled a sensitive problem before and after taking our training:

“Part of my responsibility,”she reported,“deals with setting up and maintaining incentive systems and standards for our operators so they can make more money by producing more yarn. The system we were using had worked fine when we had only two or three different types of yarn, but recently we had expanded our inventory and capabilities to enable us to run more than twelve different varieties. The present system was no longer adequate to pay the operators fairly for the work being performed and give them an incentive to increase production. I had worked up a new system which would enable us to pay the operator by the class of yarn she was running at any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered the meeting determined to prove to the management that my system was the right approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong and showed where they were being unfair and how I had all the answers they needed. To say the least, I failed miserably! I had become so busy defending my position on the new system that I had left them no opening to graciously admit their problems on the old one. The issue was dead.

“After several sessions of this course, I realized all too well where I had made my mistakes. I called another meeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point, and I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to proceed. With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted it.

“I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.”

Let's take another example—and remember these cases I am citing are typical of the experiences of thousands of other people. R. V. Crowley was a salesman for a lumber company in New York. Crowley admitted that he had been telling hard-boiled lumber inspectors for years that they were wrong. And he had won the arguments too. But it hadn't done any good.“For these lumber inspectors,”said Mr. Crowley,“are like baseball umpires. Once they make a decision, they never change it.”

Mr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of dollars through the arguments he won. So while taking my course, he resolved to change tactics and abandon arguments. With what results? Here is the story as he told it to the fellow members of his class:

“One morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and bothered person at the other end proceeded to inform me that a car of lumber we had shipped into his plant was entirely unsatisfactory. His firm had stopped unloading and requested that we make immediate arrangements to remove the stock from their yard. After about one-fourth of the car had been unloaded, their lumber inspector reported that the lumber was running 55 percent below grade. Under the circumstances, they refused to accept it.

“I immediately started for his plant and on the way turned over in my mind the best way to handle the situation. Ordinarily, under such circumstances, I should have quoted grading rules and tried, as a result of my own experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector, to convince the other inspector that the lumber was actually up to grade, and that he was misinterpreting the rules in his inspection. However, I thought I would apply the principles learned in this training.

“When I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing agent and the lumber inspector in a wicked humor, both set for an argument and a fight. We walked out to the car that was being unloaded, and I requested that they continue to unload so that I could see how things were going. I asked the inspector to go right ahead and lay out the rejects, as he had been doing, and to put the good pieces in another pile.

“After watching him for a while it began to dawn on me that his inspection actually was much too strict and that he was misinterpreting the rules. This particular lumber was white pine, and I knew the inspector was thoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent, experienced inspector on white pine. White pine happened to be my own strong suit, but did I offer any objection to the way he was grading the lumber? None whatever. I kept on watching and gradually began to ask questions as to why certain pieces were not satisfactory. I didn't for one instant insinuate that the inspector was wrong. I emphasized that my only reason for asking was in order that we could give his firm exactly what they wanted in future shipments.

“By asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and insisting continually that they were right in laying out boards not satisfactory to their purpose, I got him warmed up, and the strained relations between us began to thaw and melt away. An occasional carefully put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind that possibly some of these rejected pieces were actually within the grade that they had bought, and that their requirements demanded a more expensive grade. I was very careful, however, not to let him think I was making an issue of this point.

“Gradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted to me that he was not experienced on white pine and began to ask me questions about each piece as it came out of the car. I would explain why such a piece came within the grade specified, but kept on insisting that we did not want him to take it if it was unsuitable for their purpose. He finally got to the point where he felt guilty every time he put a piece in the rejected pile. And at last he saw that the mistake was on their part for not having specified as good a grade as they needed.

“The ultimate outcome was that he went through the entire carload again after I left, accepted the whole lot, and we received a check in full.

“In that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination to refrain from telling the other man he was wrong, saved my company a substantial amount of cash, and it would be hard to place a money value on the good will that was saved.”

Martin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an admirer of Air Force General Daniel“Chappie”James, then the nation's highest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied,“I judge people by their own principles—not by my own.”

In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command. Another officer in attendance was astonished.“General,”he said,“do you not know that the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign you?”“Yes,”replied General Lee,“but the president asked my opinion of him; he did not ask for his opinion of me.”

By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said:“Agree with thine adversary quickly.”

And 2, 200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice—advice that is sorely needed today.“Be diplomatic,”counseled the King.“It will help you gain your point.”

In other words, don't argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don't tell them they are wrong, don't get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.




SHOW RESPECT FOR THE OTHER PERSON'S OPINIONS.

NEVER SAY,“YOU'RE WRONG.”

Chapter 14　A Drop of Honey


If your temper is aroused and you tell 'em a thing or two, you will have a fine time unloading your feelings. But what about the other person? Will he share your pleasure? Will your belligerent tones, your hostile attitude, make it easy for him to agree with you?

“If you come at me with your fists doubled,”said Woodrow Wilson,“I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and say,‘Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the points at issue are,’we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get together, we will get together.”

Nobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson's statement more than John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Back in 1915, Rockefeller was the most fiercely despised man in Colorado. One of the bloodiest strikes in the history of American industry had been shocking the state for two terrible years. Irate, belligerent miners were demanding higher wages from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company; Rockefeller controlled that company. Property had been destroyed, troops had been called out. Blood had been shed. Strikers had been shot, their bodies riddled with bullets.

At a time like that, with the air seething with hatred, Rockefeller wanted to win the strikers to his way of thinking. And he did it. How? Here's the story. After weeks spent in making friends, Rockefeller addressed the representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its entirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing resuits. It calmed the tempestuous waves of hate that threatened to engulf Rockefeller. It won him a host of admirers. It presented facts in such a friendly manner that the strikers went back to work without saying another word about the increase in wages for which they had fought so violently.

The opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note how it fairly glows with friendliness. Rockefeller, remember, was talking to men who, a few days previously, had wanted to hang him by the neck to a sour apple tree; yet he couldn't have been more gracious, more friendly if he had addressed a group of medical missionaries. His speech was radiant with such phrases as I am proud to be here, having visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but as friends …spirit of mutual friendship, our common interests, it is only by your courtesy that I am here.

“This is a red-letter day in my life,”Rockefeller began.“It is the first time I have ever had the good fortune to meet the representatives of the employees of this great company, its officers and superintendents, together, and I can assure you that I am proud to be here, and that I shall remember this gathering as long as I live. Had this meeting been held two weeks ago, I should have stood here a stranger to most of you, recognizing a few faces. Having had the opportunity last week of visiting all the camps in the southern coal field and of talking individually with practically all of the representatives, except those who were away; having visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but as friends, and it is in that spirit of mutual friendship that I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss with you our common interests.

“Since this is a meeting of the officers of the company and the representatives of the employees, it is only by your courtesy that I am here, for I am not so fortunate as to be either one or the other; and yet I feel that I am intimately associated with you men, for, in a sense, I represent both the stockholders and the directors.”

Isn't that a superb example of the fine art of making friends out of enemies?

Suppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose he had argued with those miners and hurled devastating facts in their faces. Suppose he had told them by his tones and insinuations that they were wrong. Suppose that, by all the rules of logic, he had proved that they were wrong. What would have happened? More anger would have been stirred up, more hatred, more revolt.

If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can't win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don't want to change their minds. They can't be forced or driven to agree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.

Lincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his words:

It is an old and true maxim that“a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.

Business executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers. For example, when 2,500 employees in the White Motor Company's plant struck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then president of the company, didn't lose his temper and condemn and threaten and talk of tyranny and Communists. He actually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on“the peaceful way in which they laid down their tools.”Finding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple of dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited them to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling, he rented a bowling alley.

This friendliness on Mr. Black's part did what friendliness always does: it begot friendliness. So the strikers borrowed brooms, shovels, and rubbish carts, and began picking up matches, papers, cigarette stubs, and cigar butts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine strikers tidying up the factory grounds while battling for higher wages and recognition of the union. Such an event had never been heard of before in the long, tempestuous history of American labor wars. That strike ended with a compromise settlement within a week—ended without any ill feeling or rancor.

Daniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like Jehovah, was one of the most successful advocates who ever pleaded a case; yet he ushered in his most powerful arguments with such friendly remarks as:“It will be for the jury to consider,”“This may, perhaps, be worth thinking of,”“Here are some facts that I trust you will not lose sight of,”or“You, with your knowledge of human nature, will easily see the significance of these facts.”No bulldozing. No high pressure methods. No attempt to force his opinions on others. Webster used the soft-spoken, quiet, friendly approach, and it helped to make him famous.

You may never be called upon to settle a strike or address a jury, but you may want to get your rent reduced. Will the friendly approach help you then? Let's see.

O. L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced. And he knew his landlord was hard-boiled.“I wrote him,”Mr. Straub said in a speech before the class,“notifying him that I was vacating my apartment as soon as my lease expired. The truth was, I didn't want to move. I wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced. But the situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants had tried—and failed. Everyone told me that the landlord was extremely difficult to deal with. But I said to myself,‘I am studying a course in how to deal with people, so I'll try it on him—and see how it works.’

“He and his secretary came to see me as soon as he got my letter. I met him at the door with a friendly greeting. I fairly bubbled with good will and enthusiasm. I didn't begin talking about how high the rent was. I began talking about how much I liked his apartment house. Believe me, I was‘hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.’I complimented him on the way he ran the building and told him I should like so much to stay for another year but I couldn't afford it.

“He had evidently never had such a reception from a tenant. He hardly knew what to make of it.

“Then he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining tenants. One had written him fourteen letters, some of them positively insulting. Another threatened to break his lease unless the landlord kept the man on the floor above from snoring.‘What a relief it is,’he said,‘to have a satisfied tenant like you.’And then, without my even asking him to do it, he offered to reduce my rent a little. I wanted more, so I named the figure I could afford to pay, and he accepted without a word.

“As he was leaving, he turned to me and asked,‘What decorating can I do for you?’

“If I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods the other tenants were using, I am positive I should have met with the same failure they encountered. It was the friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach that won.”

Dean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the superintendent of a department of the local electric company. His staff was called upon to repair some equipment on top of a pole. This type of work had formerly been performed by a different department and had only recently been transferred to Woodcock's section. Although his people had been trained in the work, this was the first time they had ever actually been called upon to do it. Everybody in the organization was interested in seeing if and how they could handle it. Mr. Woodcock, several of his subordinate managers, and members of other departments of the utility went to see the operation. Many cars and trucks were there, and a number of people were standing around watching the two lone men on top of the pole.

Glancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the street getting out of his car with a camera. He began taking pictures of the scene. Utility people are extremely conscious of public relations, and suddenly Woodcock realized what this setup looked like to the man with the camera—overkill, dozens of people being called out to do a two-person job. He strolled up the street to the photographer.

“I see you're interested in our operation.”

“Yes, and my mother will be more than interested. She owns stock in your company. This will be an eye-opener for her. She may even decide her investment was unwise. I've been telling her for years there's a lot of waste motion in companies like yours. This proves it. The newspapers might like these pictures, too.”

“It does look like it, doesn't it? I'd think the same thing in your position. But this is a unique situation…”And Dean Woodcock went on to explain how this was the first job of this type for his department and how everybody from executives down was interested. He assured the man that under normal conditions two people could handle the job. The photographer put away his camera, shook Woodcock's hand, and thanked him for taking the time to explain the situation to him.

Dean Woodcock's friendly approach saved his company much embarrassment and bad publicity.

Another member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton, New Hampshire, reported how by using a friendly approach, he obtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.

“Early in the spring,”he reported,“before the ground had thawed from the winter freezing, there was an unusually heavy rainstorm and the water, which normally would have run off to nearby ditches and storm drains along the road, took a new course onto a building lot where I had just built a new home.

“Not being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the foundation of the house. The water forced itself under the concrete basement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement filled with water. This ruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair this damage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had no insurance to cover this type of damage.

“However, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had neglected to put in a storm drain near the house which could have prevented this problem. I made an appointment to see him. During the twenty-fivemile trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation and, remembering the principles I learned in this course, I decided that showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile purpose. When I arrived, I kept very calm and started by talking about his recent vacation to the West Indies; then, when I felt the timing was right, I mentioned the‘little’problem of water damage. He quickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the problem.

“A few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage and also put in a storm drain to prevent the same thing from happening in the future.

“Even though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I had not begun in a friendly way, there would have been a great deal of difficulty in getting him to agree to the total liability.”




Years ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in northwest Missouri, I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said,“I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.”

So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.

Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.

The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved this when he had to take his four-month-old car to the service department of the car dealer for the third time. He told our class:“It was apparent that talking to, reasoning with or shouting at the service manager was not going to lead to a satisfactory resolution of my problems.

“I walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency owner, Mr. White. After a short wait, I was ushered into Mr. White's office. I introduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my car from his dealership because of the recommendations of friends who had had previous dealings with him. I was told that his prices were very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened to me. I then explained the problem I was having with the service department.‘I thought you might want to be aware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,’I added. He thanked me for calling this to his attention and assured me that my problem would be taken care of. Not only did he personally get involved. but he also lent me his car to use while mine was being repaired.”




Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years before Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world.

Remember what Lincoln said:“A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”




BEGIN IN A FRIENDLY WAY.





Chapter 15　The Secret of Socrates


In talking with people, don't begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.

Get the other person saying“Yes, yes”at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying“No.”

A“No”response, according to Professor Overstreet,(1) is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said“No,”all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the“No”was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative direction.

The skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of“Yes”responses. This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction.

The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says“No”and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism—glandular, nervous, muscular—gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says“Yes,”none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward— moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more“Yeses”we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.

It is a very simple technique—this yes response. And yet, how much it is neglected! It often seems as if people get a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others at the outset.

Get a student to say“No”at the beginning, or a customer, child, husband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom and the patience of angels to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.

The use of this“yes, yes”technique enabled James Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings Bank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.

“This man came in to open an account,”said Mr. Eberson,“and I gave him our usual form to fill out. Some of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.

“Before I began the study of human relations, I would have told this prospective depositor that if he refused to give the bank this information, we should have to refuse to accept this account. I am ashamed that I have been guilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally, an ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown who was boss, that the bank's rules and regulations couldn't be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly didn't give a feeling of welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us his patronage.

“I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to talk about what the bank wanted but about what the customer wanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him saying‘yes, yes’from the very start. So I agreed with him. I told him the information he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.

“‘However,’I said,‘suppose you have money in this bank at your death. Wouldn't you like to have the bank transfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according to law?’

“‘Yes, of course,’he replied.

“‘Don't you think,’I continued,‘that it would be a good idea to give us the name of your next of kin so that, in the event of your death, we could carry out your wishes without error or delay?’

“Again he said,‘Yes.’

“The young man's attitude softened and changed when he realized that we weren't asking for this information for our sake but for his sake. Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave me complete information about himself but he opened, at my suggestion, a trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions concerning his mother also.

“I found that by getting him to say‘yes, yes’from the outset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I suggested.”

Joseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse Electric Company, had this story to tell:“There was a man in my territory that our company was most eager to sell to. My predecessor had called on him for ten years without selling anything. When I took over the territory, I called steadily for three years without getting an order. Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales talk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all right, an order for several hundred more would follow. Such was my expectation.

“Right? I knew they would be all right. So when I called three weeks later, I was in high spirits.

“The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement:‘Allison, I can't buy the remainder of the motors from you.’

“‘Why?’I asked in amazement.‘Why?’

“‘Because your motors are too hot. I can't put my hand on them.’

“I knew it wouldn't do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting the‘yes, yes’response.“‘Well, now look, Mr. Smith,’I said.‘I agree with you a hundred percent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy any more of them. You must have motors that won't run any hotter than standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn't that so?’

“He agreed it was. I had gotten my first‘yes.’

“‘The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a properly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?’

“‘yes,’he agreed.‘That's quite correct. But your motors are much hotter.’

“I didn't argue with him. I merely asked:‘How hot is the mill room?’

“‘Oh,’he said,‘about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.’

“‘Well,’I replied,‘if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn't you scald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit?’

“Again he had to say‘yes’.

“‘Well,’I suggested,‘wouldn't it be a good idea to keep your hands off those motors?

“‘Well, I guess you're right,’he admitted. We continued to chat for a while. Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month.

“It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost business before I finally learned that it doesn't pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other person's viewpoint and try to get that person saying‘yes, yes.’”

Eddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells how he became a good customer of a shop because the proprietor got him to say“yes, yes.”Eddie had become interested in bow hunting and had spent considerable money in purchasing equipment and supplies from a local bow store. When his brother was visiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store. The sales clerk told him they didn't rent bows, so Eddie phoned another bow store. Eddie described what happened:

“A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to my question for a rental was completely different from the other place. He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows because they couldn't afford to do so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I replied,‘Yes, several years ago.’He reminded me that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said‘yes’again. He then asked if I was the kind of person who liked to save money. Naturally, I answered‘yes.’He went on to explain that they had bow sets with all the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a complete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained that is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was reasonable? My‘yes’response led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased several more items at this shop and have since become a regular customer.”

Socrates,“the gadfly of Athens,”was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known. He did something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.

His method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not Socrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now called the“Socratic method,”was based upon getting a“yes, yes”response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.

The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let's remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question—a question that will get the“yes, yes”response.

The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the ageold wisdom of the Orient:“He who treads softly goes far.”

They have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those cultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity:“He who treads softly goes far.”




GET THE OTHER PERSON SAYING“YES, YES”IMMEDIATELY.

Chapter 16　How to Get Cooperation


Don't you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn't it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people? Isn't it wiser to make suggestions—and let the other person think out the conclusion?

Adolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my courses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged and disorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly what they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the blackboard. He then said:“I'll give you all these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from you.”The replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic work. The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration— one salesperson volunteered to work fourteen hours a day—and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.

“The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,”said Mr. Seltz,“and as long as I lived up to my part in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes and desires was just the shot in the arm they needed.”

No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.

Take the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of dollars in commissions before he learned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile manufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in New York once a week, every week for three years.“He never refused to see me,”said Mr. Wesson,“but he never bought. He always looked over my sketches very carefully and then said:‘No, Wesson, I guess we don't get together today.’”

After 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he resolved to devote one evening a week to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.

He decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists' sketches under his arm, he rushed over to the buyer's office.“I want you to do me a little favor, if you will,”he said.“Here are some uncompleted sketches. Won't you please tell me how we could finish them up in such a way that you could use them?”

The buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word. Finally he said:“Leave these with me for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see me.”

Wesson returned three days later, got his suggestions, took the sketches back to the studio and had them finished according to the buyer's ideas. The result? All accepted.

After that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson. all drawn according to the buyer's ideas.“I realized why I had failed for years to sell him,”said Mr. Wesson.“I had urged him to buy what I thought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely.I urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn't have to sell him. He bought.”

Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and politics, it works in family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this principle:

“My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing vacation trips we have ever taken. I had long dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and our nation's capital. Valley Forge, Jamestown and the restored colonial village of Williamsburg were high on the list of things I wanted to see.

“In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our summer vacation which included a tour of the western states, visiting points of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had wanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn't obviously make both trips.

“Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U. S. history in junior high school and had become very interested in the events that had shaped our country's growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the places she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would love to.

“Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy announced that if we all agreed, the summer's vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would be a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of us.We all concurred.”

This same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his equipment to one of the largest hospitals in Brooklyn. This hospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray department in America. Dr. L—, who was in charge of the X-ray department, was overwhelmed with sales representatives, each caroling the praises of his own company's equipment.

One manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more about handling human nature than the others did. He wrote a letter something like this:

Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these machines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So we should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how they can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you specify.

“I was surprised to get that letter,”Dr. L— said as he related the incident before the class.“I was both surprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel important. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the equipment. The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I liked it.

“Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that equipment for the hospital was my own. I sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.”

Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay“Self-Reliance”stated:“In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”

Colonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national and international affairs while Woodrow Wilson occupied the White House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice more than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.

What method did the Colonel use in influencing the President? Fortunately, we know, for House himself revealed it to Arthur D. Howden Smith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The Saturday Evening Post.

“‘After I got to know the President,’House said,‘I learned the best way to convert him to an idea was to plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in it—so as to get him thinking about it on his own account. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been visiting him at the White House and urged a policy on him which he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot out my suggestion as his own.’”

Did House interrupt him and say,“That's not your idea. That's mine”? Oh, no. Not House. He was too adroit for that. He didn't care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was his. House did even more than that. He gave wilson public credit for these ideas.

Let's remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So let's use Colonel House's technique.

A man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick used this technique on me and won my patronage. I was planning at the time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the tourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately overwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed testimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered. I didn't know which to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and telephone numbers of several New York people who had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover for myself what he had to offer.

I found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I telephoned him, found out what his experience had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.

The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That organization won.

Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book might use today:

“The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.”




LET THE OTHER PERSON FEEL THAT THE IDEA IS HIS OR HERS.





Chapter 17　An Appeal That Everybody Likes


I was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out in Missouri, and I visited the James farm at Kearney, Missouri, where the son of Jesse James was then living.

His wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains and held up banks and then gave money to the neighboring farmers to pay off their mortgages.

Jesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist at heart, just as Dutch Schultz,“Two Gun”Crowley, Al Capone and many other organized crime“godfathers”did generations later. The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.

J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.

The person himself will think of the real reason. You don't need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.

Is that too idealistic to work in business? Let's see. Let's take the case of Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell Company of Glenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell had a disgruntled tenant who threatened to move. The tenant's lease still had four months to run; nevertheless, he served notice that he was vacating immediately, regardless of lease.

“These people had lived in my house all winter—the most expensive part of the year,”Mr. Farrell said as he told the story to the class,“and I knew it would be difficult to rent the apartment again before fall. I could see all that rent income going over the hill and believe me, I saw red.

“Now, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant and advised him to read his lease again. I would have pointed out that if he moved, the full balance of his rent would fall due at once—and that I could, and would, move to collect.

“However, instead of flying off the handle and making a scene, I decided to try other tactics. So I started like this:‘Mr. Doe,’I said,‘I have listened to your story, and I still don't believe you intend to move. Years in the renting business have taught me something about human nature, and I sized you up in the first place as being a man of your word. In fact, I'm so sure of it that I'm willing to take a gamble.

“‘Now, here's my proposition. Lay your decision on the table for a few days and think it over. If you come back to me between now and the first of the month, when your rent is due, and tell me you still intend to move, I give you my word I will accept your decision as final. I will privilege you to move and admit to myself I've been wrong in my judgment. But I still believe you're a man of your word and will live up to your contract. For after all, we are either men or monkeys—and the choice usually lies with ourselves!’

“Well, when the new month came around, this gentleman came to see me and paid his rent in person. He and his wife had talked it over, he said—and decided to stay. They had concluded that the only honorable thing to do was to live up to their lease.”

When the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of him which he didn't want published, he wrote the editor a letter. But did he say,“Please do not publish that picture of me any more; I don't like it”? No, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the respect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He wrote,“Please do not publish that picture of me any more. My mother doesn't like it.”

When John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper photographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn't say:“I don't want their pictures published.”No, he appealed to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from harming children. He said:“You know how it is, boys. You've got children yourselves, some of you. And you know it's not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.”

When Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine, was starting on his meteoric career, which was destined to make him millions as owner of The Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies' Home Journal, he couldn't afford to pay his contributors the prices that other magazines paid. He couldn't afford to hire firstclass authors to write for money alone. So he appealed to their nobler motives. For example, he persuaded even Louisa May Alcott, the immortal author of Little Women, to write for him when she was at the flood tide of her fame; and he did it by offering to send a check for a hundred dollars, not to her, but to her favorite charity.

Right here the skeptic may say:“Oh, that stuff is all right for Northcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental novelist. But, I'd like to see you make it work with the tough babies I have to collect bills from!”

You may be right. Nothing will work in all cases—and nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?

At any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this true story told by James L. Thomas, a former student of mine:

Six customers of a certain automobile company refused to pay their bills for servicing. None of the customers protested the entire bill, but each claimed that some one charge was wrong. In each case, the customer had signed for the work done, so the company knew it was right—and said so. That was the first mistake.

Here are the steps the men in the credit department took to collect these overdue bills. Do you suppose they succeeded?

1. They called on each customer and told him bluntly that they had come to collect a bill that was long past due.

2. They made it very plain that the company was absolutely and unconditionally right; therefore he, the customer, was absolutely and unconditionally wrong.

3. They intimated that they, the company, knew more about automobiles than he could ever hope to know. So what was the argument about?

4. Result: They argued.

Did any of these methods reconcile the customer and settle the account? You can answer that one yourself.

At this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to open fire with a battery of legal talent, when fortunately the matter came to the attention of the general manager. The manager investigated these defaulting clients and discovered that they all had the reputation of paying their bills promptly. Something was wrong here—something was drastically wrong about the method of collection. So he called in James L. Thomas and told him to collect these“uncollectible”accounts.

Here, in his words, are the steps Mr. Thomas took:

1. My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill long past due—a bill that we knew was absolutely right. But I didn't say a word about that. I explained I had called to find out what it was the company had done, or failed to do.

2. I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer's story, I had no opinion to offer. I told him the company made no claims to being infallible.

3. I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he knew more about his car than anyone else in the world; that he was the authority on the subject.

4. I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest and sympathy that he wanted—and had expected.

5. Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood, I put the whole thing up to his sense of fair play. I appealed to the nobler motives.“First,”I said,“I want you to know I also feel this matter has been badly mishandled. You've been inconvenienced and annoyed and irritated by one of our representatives. That should never have happened. I' m sorry and, as a representative of the company, I apologize. As I sat here and listened to your side of the story, I could not help being impressed by your fairness and patience. And now, because you are fair— minded and patient, I am going to ask you to do something for me. It's something that you can do better than anyone else, something you know more about than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it is safe for me to ask you to adjust it, just as you would do if you were the president of my company. I am going to leave it all up to you. Whatever you say goes.”

Did he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a kick out of it. The bills ranged from $150 to $400—but did the customer give himself the best of it? Yes, one of them did! One of them refused to pay a penny of the disputed charge; but the other five all gave the company the best of it! And here's the cream of the whole thing: we delivered new cars to all six of these customers within the next two years!

“Experience has taught me,”says Mr. Thomas,“that when no information can be secured about the customer, the only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges, once convinced they are correct. To put it differently and perhaps more clearly, people are honest and want to discharge their obligations. The exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair.”




APPEAL TO THE NOBLER MOTIVES.





Chapter 18　How to Criticize—and Not Be Hated for It


Charles Schwab was passing through one of his steel mills one day at noon when he came across some of his employees smoking. Immediately above their heads was a sign that said“No Smoking.”Did Schwab point to the sign and say,“Can't you read?”Oh, no not Schwab. He walked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and said,“I'll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on the outside.”They knew that he knew that they had broken a rule—and they admired him because he said nothing about it and gave them a little present and made them feel important. Couldn't keep from loving a man like that, could you?

John Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker used to make a tour of his great store in Philadelphia every day. Once he saw a customer waiting at a counter. No one was paying the slightest attention to her. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a huddle at the far end of the counter laughing and talking among themselves. Wanamaker didn't say a word. Quietly slipping behind the counter, he waited on the woman himself and then handed the purchase to the salespeople to be wrapped as he went on his way.

Public officials are often criticized for not being accessible to their constituents. They are busy people, and the fault sometimes lies in overprotective assistants who don't want to overburden their bosses with too many visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of Orlando, Florida, the home of Disney World, for many years, frequently admonished his staff to allow people to see him. He claimed he had an“open-door”policy; yet the citizens of his community were blocked by secretaries and administrators when they called.

Finally the mayor found the solution. He removed the door from his office! His aides got the message, and the mayor has had a truly open administration since the day his door was symbolically thrown away.

Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell the difference between failure and success in changing people without giving offense or arousing resentment.

Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word“but”and ending with a critical statement. For example, in trying to change a child's careless attitude toward studies, we might say,“We're really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.”

In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word“but.”He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead—in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie's attitude toward his studies.

This could be easily overcome by changing the word“but”to“and.”“We're really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.”

Now, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no follow-up of an inference of failure. We have called his attention to the behavior we wished to change indirectly, and the chances are he will try to live up to our expectations.

Calling attention to one's mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, told one of our classes how she convinced some sloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves when they were building additions to her house.

For the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from her job, she noticed that the yard was strewn with the cut ends of lumber. She didn't want to antagonize the builders, because they did excellent work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her children picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris in a corner. The following morning she called the foreman to one side and said,“I'm really pleased with the way the front lawn was left last night; it is nice and clean and does not offend the neighbors.”From that day forward the workers picked up and piled the debris to one side, and the foreman came in each day seeking approval of the condition the lawn was left in after a day's work.

One of the major areas of controversy between members of the army reserves and their regular army trainers is haircuts. The reservists consider themselves civilians (which they are most of the time) and resent having to cut their hair short.

Master Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR School addressed himself to this problem when he was working with a group of reserve noncommissioned officers. As an old-time regular-army master sergeant, he might have been expected to yell at his troops and threaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.

“Gentlemen,”he started,“you are leaders. You will be most effective when you lead by example. You must be the example for your men to follow. You Know what the army regulations say about haircuts. I am going to get my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter than some of yours. You look at yourself in the mirror, and if you feel you need a haircut to be a good example, we'll arrange time for you to visit the post barbershop.”

The result was predictable. Several of the candidates did look in the mirror and went to the barbershop that afternoon and received“regulation”haircuts. Sergeant Kaiser commented the next morning that he already could see the development of leadership qualities in some of the members of the squad.

On March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited to speak in the pulpit left silent by Beecher's passing. Eager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote and polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he read it to his wife. It was poor—as most written speeches are. She might have said, if she had had less judgment,“Lyman, that is terrible. That'll never do. You'll put people to sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to know better than that after all the years you have been preaching. For heaven's sake, why don't you talk like a human being? Why don't you act natural? You'll disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff.”

That's what she might have said. And, if she had, you know what would have happened. And she knew too. So, she merely remarked that it would make an excellent article for the North American Review. In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that it wouldn't do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point, tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached without even using notes.




An effective way to correct others' mistakes is…

CALL ATTENTION TO PEOPLE'S MISTAKES INDIRECTLY.





Chapter 19　Talk About Your Own Mistakes First


My niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York to be my secretary. She was nineteen, had graduated from high school three years previously, and her business experience was a trifle more than zero. She became one of the most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but in the beginning, she was—well, susceptible to improvement. One day when I started to criticize her, I said to myself.“Just a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice as old as Josephine. You have had ten thousand times as much business experience. How can you possibly expect her to have your viewpoint, your judgment, your initiative—mediocre though they may be? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at nineteen? Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders you made? Remember the time you did this…and that…?”

After thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially, I concluded that Josephine's batting average at nineteen was better than mine had been—and that, I'm sorry to confess, isn't paying Josephine much of a compliment.

So after that, when I wanted to call Josephine's at tention to a mistake, I used to begin by saying,“You have made a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord knows, it's no worse than many I have made. You were not born with judgment. That comes only with experience, and you are better than I was at your age. I have been guilty of so many stupid, silly things myself, I have very little inclination to criticize you or anyone. But don't you think it would have been wiser if you had done so and so?”

It isn't nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.

E. G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, was having problems with his new secretary. Letters he dictated were coming to his desk for signature with two or three spelling mistakes per page. Mr. Dillistone reported how he handled this:

“Like many engineers, I have not been noted for my excellent English or spelling. For years I have kept a little black thumb-index book for words I had trouble spelling. When it became apparent that merely pointing out the errors was not going to cause my secretary to do more proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to take another approach. When the next letter came to my attention that had errors in it, I sat down with the typist and said:

“‘Somehow this word doesn't look right. It's one of the words I always have had trouble with. That's the reason I started this spelling book of mine. [I opened the book to the appropriate page. ] Yes, here it is. I'm very conscious of my spelling now because people do judge us by our letters and misspellings make us look less professional.’

“I don't know whether she copied my system or not, but since that conversation, her frequency of spelling errors has been significantly reduced.”

The polished Prince Bernhard von Bülow learned the sharp necessity of doing this back in 1909. Von Bülow was then the Imperial Chancellor of Germany, and on the throne set Wilhelm II—Wilhelm, the haughty; Wilhelm, the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German Kaisers, building an army and navy that he boasted could whip their weight in wildcats.

Then an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said things, incredible things, things that rocked the continent and started a series of explosions heard around the world. To make matters infinitely worse, the Kaiser made silly, egotistical, absurd announcements in public, he made them while he was a guest in England, and he gave his royal permission to have them printed in the Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was the only German who felt friendly toward the English; that he was constructing a navy against the menace of Japan; that he, and he alone, had saved England from being humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it had been his campaign plan that enabled England's Lord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and so on and on.

No other such amazing words had ever fallen from the lips of a European king in peacetime within a hundred years. The entire continent buzzed with the fury of a hornet's nest. England was incensed. German statesmen were aghast. And in the midst of all this consternation, the Kaiser became panicky and suggested to Prince von Bülow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the blame. Yes, he wanted von Bülow to announce that it was all his responsibility, that he had advised his monarch to say these incredible things.

“But Your Majesty,”von Bülow protested,“it seems to me utterly impossible that anybody either in Germany or England could suppose me capable of having advised Your Majesty to say any such thing.”

The moment those words were out of von Bülow's mouth, he realized he had made a grave mistake. The Kaiser blew up.

“You consider me a donkey,”he shouted,“capable of blunders you yourself could never have committed!”

Von Bülow knew that he ought to have praised before he condemned; but since that was too late, he did the next best thing. He praised after he had criticized. And it worked a miracle.

“I'm far from suggesting that,”he answered respectfully.“Your Majesty surpasses me in many respects; not only, of course, in naval and military knowledge, but above all, in natural science. I have often listened in admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer, or wireless telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am shamefully ignorant of all branches of natural science, have no notion of chemistry or physics, and am quite incapable of explaining the simplest of natural phenomena. But,”von Bülow continued,“in compensation, I possess some historical knowledge and perhaps certain qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.”

The Kaiser beamed. Von Bülow had praised him. Von Bülow had exalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser could forgive anything after that.“Haven't I always told you,”he exclaimed with enthusiasm,“that we complete one another famously? We should stick together, and we will!”

He shook hands with von Bülow, not once, but several times. And later in the day he waxed so enthusiastic that he exclaimed with doubled fists,“If anyone says anything to me against Prince von Bülow, I shall punch him in the nose.”

Von Bülow saved himself in time—but, canny diplomat that he was, he nevertheless had made one error: he should have begun by talking about his own shortcomings and Wilhelm's superiority—not by intimating that the Kaiser was a half-wit in need of a guardian.

If a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the other party can turn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a staunch friend, imagine what humility and praise can do for you and me in our daily contacts. Rightfully used, they will work veritable miracles in human relations.

Admitting one's own mistakes—even when one hasn't corrected them—can help convince somebody to change his behavior. This was illustrated more recently by Clarence Zerhusen of Timonium, Maryland, when he discovered his fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with cigarettes.

“Naturally, I didn't want David to smoke,”Mr. Zerhusen told us,“but his mother and I smoked cigarettes; we were giving him a bad example all the time. I explained to Dave how I started smoking at about his age and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now it was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him how irritating my cough was and how he had been after me to give up cigarettes not many years before.

“I didn't exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their dangers. All I did was point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and what it had meant to me.

“He thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn't smoke until he had graduated from high school. As the years went by David never did start smoking and has no intention of ever doing so.

“As a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop smoking cigarettes myself, and with the support of my family, I have succeeded.”




A good leader follows this principle:

TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN MISTAKES BEFORE CRITICIZING THE OTHER PERSON.





Chapter 20　No One Likes to Take Orders


I once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of American biographers. When I told her I was writing this book, we began discussing this all—important subject of getting along with people, and she told me that while she was writing her biography of Owen D. Young, she interviewed a man who had sat for three years in the same office with Mr. Young. This man declared that during all that time he had never heard Owen D. Young give a direct order to anyone. He always gave suggestions, not orders. Owen D. Young never said, for example,“Do this or do that,”or“Don't do this or don't do that.”He would say,“You might consider this,”or“Do you think that would work?”Frequently he would say, after he had dictated a letter,“What do you think of this?”In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he would say,“Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it would be better.”He always gave people the opportunity to do things themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them, let them learn from their mistakes.

A technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A technique like that saves a person's pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.

Resentment caused by a brash order may last a long time—even if the order was given to correct an obviously bad situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had blocked the entrance way to one of the school's shops by illegally parking his car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into the classroom and asked in an arrogant tone,“Whose car is blocking the driveway?”When the student who owned the car responded, the instructor screamed:“Move that car and move it right now, or I'll wrap a chain around it and drag it out of there.”

Now that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked there. But from that day on, not only did that student resent the instructor's action, but all the students in the class did everything they could to give the instructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant.

How could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a friendly way,“Whose car is in the driveway?”and then suggested that if it were moved, other cars could get in and out, the student would have gladly moved it and neither he nor his classmates would have been upset and resentful.

Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.

When Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing in precision machine parts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order, he was convinced that he would not meet the promised delivery date. The work already scheduled in the shop and the short completion time needed for this order made it seem impossible for him to accept the order.

Instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the order through, he called everybody together, explained the situation to them, and told them how much it would mean to the company and to them if they could make it possible to produce the order on time. Then he started asking questions:

“Is there anything we can do to handle this order?”

“Can anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop that will make it possible to take the order?”

“Is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that would help?”

The employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take the order. They approached it with a“We can do it”attitude, and the order was accepted, produced and delivered on time.




An effective leader will use…

ASK QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF GIVING DIRECT ORDERS.





Chapter 21　Let the Other Person Save Face


Years ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the company didn't dare offend the man. He was indispensable— and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric Company—a new title for work he was already doing—and let someone else head up the department.

Steinmetz was happy.

So were the officers of G. E. They had gently maneuvered their most temperamental star, and they had done it without a storm—by letting him save face.

Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person's pride. Whereas a few minutes' thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person's attitude. would go so far toward alleviating the sting!

Let's remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful necessity of discharging or reprimanding an employee.

“Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.”(I'm quoting now from a letter written me by Marshall A. Granger, a certified public accountant. )“Our business is mostly seasonal. There-fore we have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush is over.

“It's a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the ax. Consequently, the custom has developed of getting it over as soon as possible, and usually in the following way:‘Sit down, Mr. Smith. The season's over, and we don't seem to see any more assignments for you. Of course, you understood you were only employed for the busy season anyhow, etc., etc.’

“The effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling of being‘let down’. Most of them are in the accounting field for life, and they retain no particular love for the firm that drops them so casually.

“I recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little more tact and consideration. So I call each one in only after carefully thinking over his or her work during the winter. And I've said something like this:‘Mr. Smith, you've done a fine job (if he has).That time we sent you to Newark, you had a tough assignment. You were on the spot, but you came through with flying colors, and we want you to know the firm is proud of you. You've got the stuff—you're going a long way, wherever you're working. This firm believes in you, and is rooting for you, and we don't want you to forget it.’

“Effect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired. They don't feel‘let down’. They know if we had work for them, we'd keep them on. And when we need them again, they come to us with a keen personal affection.”

At one session of our course, two class members discussed the negative effects of faultfinding versus the positive effects of letting the other person save face.

Fred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that occurred in his company:“At one of our production meetings, a vice president was asking very pointed questions of one of our production supervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was aggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his peers, the supervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the vice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of lying.

“Any working relationship that might have existed prior to this encounter was destroyed in a few brief moments. This supervisor, who was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from that time on. A few months later he left our firm and went to work for a competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job.”

Another class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar incident had occurred at her job—but what a difference in approach and results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing specialist for a food packer, was given her first major assignment—the test-marketing of a new product. She told the class:“When the results of the test came in, I was devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning, and the entire test had to be done all over again. To make this worse, I had no time to discuss it with my boss before the meeting in which I was to make my report on the project.

“When I was called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I had all I could do to keep from breaking down, but I resolved I would not cry and have all those men make remarks about women not being able to handle a management job because they are too emotional. I made my report briefly and stated that due to an error I would repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat down, expecting my boss to blow up.

“Instead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not unusual for a person to make an error on a new project and that he had confidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and meaningful to the company. He assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that he had faith in me and knew I had done by best, and that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was the reason for the failure.

“I left that meeting with my head up in the air and with the determination that I would never let that boss of mine down again.”

Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote:“I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”




A real leader will always follow…

LET THE OTHER PERSON SAVE FACE.
