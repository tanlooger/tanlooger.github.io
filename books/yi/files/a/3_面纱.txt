前言


这个故事受到了但丁诗歌的启发，诗行[1]如下：





“喂，等你重返人间，

在漫长的旅途中得以歇息，”

第三个精灵接着第二个精灵说道，

“请记住我，我就是皮娅[2]。

锡耶纳[3]养育了我，而马雷马[4]却毁了我，

那个娶了我的人，知道这事，

他把宝石戒指戴上我的手指。”





我当时是圣托马斯医学院的学生，刚满二十岁，复活节正好有六周的假期。于是，我提着装着衣服的格莱斯顿式旅行提包，口袋里带着二十英镑就出发了。我去了热那亚和比萨，然后又去了佛罗伦萨。在佛罗伦萨的劳拉街[5]上我租了间小屋，从房间的窗户能看见大教堂可爱的圆屋顶。房主是个寡妇，有一个女儿，她接受食宿全包（经过好一阵激烈的讨价还价之后达成的）、每天四个里拉的租金这一条件。恐怕她也赚不了什么钱，因为我的饭量巨大，可以轻而易举地把小山般的几盘意大利通心粉一扫而光。她在托斯卡纳小山上有一块葡萄园，在我的记忆中，她用自己种植的葡萄酿成的基安蒂红葡萄酒是我在意大利喝过的最棒的葡萄酒了。寡妇的女儿每天给我上一节意大利语课，在我看来，她虽说已经过了豆蔻年华，但我想不会超过二十六岁。她曾经历过不幸，未婚夫是个军官，在阿比西尼亚[6]遇难，而她此后便守身如玉。不难理解，在她母亲（她是个丰满的、灰头发、生性快乐的夫人，在亲爱的上帝看到合适的机会之前，她是不打算去见他的）去世后，艾尔斯丽娅肯定会投身宗教，对于做修女，艾尔斯丽娅怀着快乐的心情在期盼着。她很爱笑，我们在午餐和晚餐的时候，都很开心，但是她一给我上起课来，就变得严肃起来了。每当我犯傻或者精神不集中的时候，她就会用黑色的尺子猛地敲打我的指关节。被像小孩子般地对待，按理我应该感到气愤，但是一想到我曾在书中读到过的对那种老派小学教师的描述，我就忍不住哈哈大笑起来。

我的日子过得忙忙碌碌。每一天都是先从翻译几页易卜生戏剧开始，这样做是为了使我的写作技巧更加纯熟，在写对话时能更加轻松自如。然后，我手里拿着本罗斯金[7]的著作去探究佛罗伦萨的风物。按照书中的指导，我对乔托钟楼[8]和吉贝尔蒂[9]设计建造的各种青铜门佩服得五体投地。而且，我对乌菲齐美术馆[10]内波提切利[11]的作品表现出了适当的热情，而因为那时我也有着年轻人惯有的偏激，对这位大师不欣赏的作品也不屑一顾。在午餐过后，我会上意大利语课，然后再出一次家门，去参观各式各样的教堂，一边沿着亚诺河溜达，一边做着白日梦。吃完晚饭，我又会出门去寻找刺激，但我是如此单纯，或者至少是如此羞怯，总而言之，我回到家里时和踏出家门时一样纯洁。虽然房东太太已经给了我钥匙，但她听到我进屋并把门闩上后，会如释重负地松一口气，因为她总是怕我忘了闩门。回到自己的房间，我又开始精读圭尔甫派和吉伯林派[12]斗争的历史。但我会很辛酸地意识到，浪漫主义时期的作家们是不会像我这样做的，我怀疑他们中任何一个人是否能像我一样，在意大利用二十英镑度过六周时间。我过得清醒而勤勉，也很喜欢这种生活。

我已经读过《地狱篇》了（我借助了翻译本，但碰到生词我还是很认真地查字典），所以艾尔斯丽娅便从《炼狱篇》教起。当我们进行到上文我引用到的那几句诗行时，她告诉我皮娅是锡耶纳的一位贵妇，她的丈夫怀疑她与人通奸，但考虑到她的家庭出身，不敢直接处死她，便把她带到了马雷马的城堡里，以为沼泽地里的毒气会让她丧命，他对自己的这个计谋深信不疑。但是，她过了很长时间都没死，他有些不耐烦了，把她从窗户扔了出去。我真的不知道艾尔斯丽娅是从哪儿听到的这个故事，据我所知，但丁不会把故事描写得这样详细，但是出于某种原因，这个故事激发了我的想象力。我在脑海中反复酝酿，很多年来，我时不时地会沉思默想它两三天，过去还常常在心底重复这诗行：锡耶纳养育了我，而马雷马却毁了我。然而，它只是我构思的众多题材中的一个而已，有很长一段时间，我都把它忘了。当然，我把它当成一个现代故事了，但无法想象在当今世界上，哪里才是这个故事发生的合理背景。直到我在中国做了一次漫长的旅行，我终于发现了这样一个背景。

我觉得这部长篇小说可能是我所有作品中唯一一部从故事本身而不是从人物开始的小说，而解释人物和情节之间的关系比较困难，你不能凭空去想象一个人物，在你想象他的时候，你要把他放到某种情景之下，想象他正在做着某事，这样一来，关于这个人物和至少他的主要行动的想象才是同步一致的。但是，这一次我先构思了故事情节，然后选择合适人物来配合故事情节的逐步展开。这些人物是以我在不同环境中早已熟知的人为原型塑造出来的。

这本书让我碰到了一名作家可能会遇到的困难与麻烦，我最初把我的主人公叫作雷恩，一个普普通通的名字。但是好像在香港，有那么几个人的名字也叫雷恩。他们提起了诉讼，连载我小说的杂志的老板不得不赔付了二百五十英镑才了结了此事。所以，我把主人公的名字改为了费恩。可随后，殖民地大臣助理觉得自己受到了诽谤，威胁要开始启动司法程序了。我感到很吃惊，因为在英国，我们可以把首相搬上舞台，或者把他作为小说中的人物。坎特伯雷大主教、大法官，以及其他位高权重的人都会面不改色心不跳。可令我感到奇怪的是这位无足轻重的，随时就得拍屁股走人的芝麻官竟然会认为小说是针对他的，但是为了避免麻烦，我还是把香港改成了一个虚构的殖民地——清延[13]。当此事发生的时候，本书已经出版，因此只能被召回。某些已经收到此书的精明的书评家，以这样或那样的借口拒绝退还此书，这些书就此产生了书志学上的价值，我觉得存世的大约有六十本，都被收藏家用高价买去了。

第一章


她发出一声惊叫。

“怎么了？”他问道。

百叶窗早已拉下，他已经适应了房间里的黑暗，猛然看见她的脸由于恐惧而变得有些扭曲。

“刚才有人动了一下门。”

“没事，也许是女仆，或者八成是哪个男仆。”

“这个时候他们是不会来的，他们都知道我在午饭后总是要睡一会儿的。”

“那还有可能会是谁呢？”

“沃尔特。”她小声地说，嘴唇颤抖着。

她指了指他的鞋。他努力地想把鞋穿上，但因为她的惊慌影响了他，他自己也开始紧张起来，笨手笨脚的，况且鞋子本身也有点儿紧，怎么也穿不进去。她不耐烦地轻叹了一口气，递给他一副鞋拔子，然后，自己慌忙地套上一件宽大的袍子，光着脚走到梳妆台前。她的头发已经剪短，在他系第二只鞋的鞋带之前，她已经用梳子把蓬乱的头发整理了一下，接着把他的外套递给他。

“我怎么出去呀？”

“你最好等一会儿。我出去看看，没事了你再出去。”

“不太可能是沃尔特，在五点之前他不会离开实验室的。”

“那会是谁？”

他们又开始小声嘀咕起来，她全身发抖。他脑海里突然闪过一个念头，在紧急时刻，她总是惊慌失措，他不免对她生起气来。如果不安全，她为什么老是说没事呢？她屏住呼吸，抓住他的胳膊。他顺着她的目光看去，面前是几扇窗户，窗外是阳台，百叶窗已经拉上了，但他们分明看见白色陶瓷的球状把手在慢慢地转动。之前他们没有听见有人在阳台走动的脚步声，所以看到把手无声地转动感到惊恐万状。一分钟过去了，还是寂静无声。随后，他们又看到另一扇窗户上的白瓷圆把手也开始诡异地转动起来，以一种同刚才一样的鬼鬼祟祟、悄无声息、令人毛骨悚然的方式。这情景如此吓人，以致凯蒂的精神一下子崩溃了，张开嘴马上要惊呼起来。但是，他似乎意识到了她的下一步举动，迅速地用手捂住了她的嘴，她的惊叫声生生被他的手掌闷住了。

还是一片寂静，她斜靠在他的身上，双腿筛糠似的抖个不停，他也担心她可能会晕倒，皱着眉头，咬紧牙关，把她搀扶到床边，让她坐了下来。她的脸色煞白，尽管他的脸已经晒成了古铜色，但此时也失去了血色。他站在她的旁边，眼睛着魔似的死死盯着那个圆形的瓷把手。他们都没有吭声，接着他看到她又要惊叫了。

“看在上帝的分儿上，别喊叫，”他气急败坏地小声说，“该来的终究会来，我们不得不豁出去了。”

她在摸索手帕，看出了她的心思，他把她的包递给了她。

“你的遮阳帽呢？”

“我把它落在楼下了。”

“噢，我的上帝！”

“我说，你必须打起点儿精神来，百分之百不会是沃尔特的，他怎么可能在这个钟点儿回来呢？他绝不会在大中午跑回家来，是吧？”

“是的。”

“我敢肯定那是某个女仆。”

她冲着他淡淡地笑了一下，他那浑厚的、充满爱抚的声音让她镇定了许多，她拉起他的手，深情地紧握着。他给了她片刻时间让她慢慢地安静下来。

“你瞧，我们不能永远待在这儿呀，”他随后说道，“你觉得能走到阳台上去看看情况吗？”

“我觉得我还站不起来。”

“这儿有白兰地吗？”

她摇了摇头。他眉头紧锁，脸色阴沉，心里又开始烦躁起来，他也不是很清楚接下来应该做些什么。突然，她更加紧张地攥着他的手。

“如果他正在外面等着该怎么办呀？”

他从嘴角挤出一丝微笑，尽量使声音保持温柔，用一种不容置疑的口吻说服她，他自己很清楚用这种语气跟她说话所能达到的效果。

“那不太可能。振作点儿，凯蒂。怎么可能是你丈夫呢？假设他回来，在门厅里看见一顶陌生的遮阳帽，来到楼上发现你的房门紧锁，肯定会大喊大叫的。所以，一定是你的某个仆人，况且只有中国人才会那样拧把手。”

她现在确实感觉回过神来了。

“即使是个女仆，也不大妙。”

“我能摆平她，如果有必要，我会搬出上帝来吓唬她。虽然作为一名政府官员好处并不多，但是总能发挥点儿作用。”

他一定是对的。她站起身来，冲着他张开了双臂，他把她搂在了怀中，亲吻着她的双唇。在狂喜中夹杂着痛楚，她崇拜他。他松开了她，她走向了窗户，抽回了窗闩，把百叶窗打开了一道缝隙，向外观望。外面没有人，她又悄悄跑到阳台上，向她丈夫的更衣室里看了看，又望了望自己的起居室，两个房间都空无一人。她回到卧室，向他挥手示意。

“没有人。”

“我觉得打开头就是我们看花了眼。”

“别笑，吓死我了。你先去我的起居室坐会儿，我得把长筒袜和鞋穿上。”





第二章


他照她的话做了，过了五分钟，她也来到起居室，他正抽着香烟。

“我说，能给我来点儿白兰地和苏打水吗？”

“好的，我按铃叫人送来。”

“照目前的情况来看，我觉得这事对你不会有什么伤害的。”

在等男仆回应的时候，他们沉默了一会儿。她又下了一道命令。

“你给实验室打个电话吧，问问沃尔特在不在，”过了一会儿她说道，“他们听不出你的声音。”

他拿起了电话，问了她号码。他在电话里询问了费恩博士在不在实验室。然后，他放下了听筒。

“午饭后他就不在实验室了，”他告诉她，“你问问那男仆他是不是回来过了。”

“我不敢，要是他回来过了，而我又没看见他，这看上去太奇怪了。”

男仆拿来了酒水，汤森自顾自地倒了一杯。当他递给凯蒂一杯时，她摇了摇头。

“如果真是沃尔特，我们该如何是好？”

“也许他不会在乎的。”

“你是说沃尔特吗？”

她的语气充满狐疑。

“我印象中他相当腼腆，你知道，有些男人经不起场面，他们明白闹出了丑闻对他们可没有丝毫好处。我觉得不可能是沃尔特，但哪怕就是他，我感觉他也不会闹出什么动静的，他会当这事没有发生过一样。”

她思索了一会儿。

“他特别爱我。”

“哦，那样更好，你可以哄哄他。”

他给了她一个迷人的微笑，对他的这种微笑，她发现自己总是无法抗拒。他的微笑首先在清澈的蓝眼睛中慢慢散开，然后逐渐游弋到有型的嘴角，最后到达小巧、洁白、整齐的牙齿。这是一种十分性感的微笑，足以令她的心为之融化。

“我并不是很担心，”她说道，带着一股突然涌出的喜悦，“这值得。”

“都是我的错。”

“你为什么过来了？看到你来让我又惊又喜。”

“我忍不住要来看你。”

“亲爱的。”

她的身子依偎着他，乌黑闪亮的双眼充满激情地凝视着他的眼睛，嘴微微张着，带着渴望。他伸过双臂把她揽了过来，她发出一声狂喜的轻叹，忘情地投入了他的怀抱。

“你知道你总能指望上我。”他说道。

“我跟你在一起幸福极了，我希望我能让你感到和我一样的幸福。”

“你不再害怕了？”

“我讨厌沃尔特。”她回答道。

他不是很清楚应该如何作答，所以亲吻着她，而她用脸温柔地贴着他的脸。

但是他抬起她的手腕，看了看腕上小金表上的时间。

“你知道我现在必须做什么了吗？”

“溜走？”她微笑着说。

他点了点头。一时间她又更紧地贴着他，但她能觉出他想要离开了，所以她放开了手。

“你玩忽职守，真不害臊，我不理你了。”

他从来不拒绝这种挑逗性的调情。

“你似乎急不可耐地要摆脱我呀。”他轻佻地说。

“你知道我不愿意让你离开。”

她的回答低沉而认真，他无言以对，只好讨好般地笑了笑。

“你的小脑袋瓜儿别再为今天的神秘来客伤神了，我敢肯定是女仆，而且如果真有什么麻烦，我保证帮你摆平。”

“你有很多经验吗？”

他的微笑显示出他既觉得好玩，又有点儿得意。

“没有呀，但我还是要自夸一下，我的脑袋还是蛮灵光的。”





第三章


她走出起居室来到阳台上，目送他离开。他向她挥了挥手，看着他的身影，她仍然有点儿激动。他已经四十一岁了，但身形轻盈，走路像个大男孩似的蹦蹦跳跳。

阳台处于阴影当中了，她带着满足的爱，心也放松下来，反而觉得慵懒的感觉袭来。他们的这栋房子坐落在幸福山谷，在小山的一侧，住在山顶可能会更称心如意，但房价要贵得多，他们负担不起。她在阳台上逗留了一阵儿，但愣着神，似乎没有注意到蓝色的海洋和港口中拥挤的船只，满脑子想的只有她的情人。

当然，今天下午他们的所作所为是愚蠢的，但是如果他想要她，她又如何能做到小心谨慎？在午饭后，他以前也来过两三次，在一天正热的时候，没人会想到要出门，所以甚至仆人们也没看到他的到来和离开。在香港，他们幽会很困难，她不喜欢这座中国城市，每次走进位于维多利亚路上的那栋肮脏而狭小的楼房时，她总是非常紧张。这是个古董商店，也是他们经常幽会的地方，坐在里面的中国人盯着她，令人讨厌。她也不喜欢那个满脸堆笑的老头儿，他把她带到商店的后堂，然后爬上一段黑乎乎的楼梯，她被领进一间散发着霉味的房间，一张大木床紧靠着墙，让她不寒而栗。

“这也太脏了，不是吗？”当她第一次在那儿见查理时，她对他说道。

“你来了，这儿就不一样了。”他回答道。

当然，他把她搂入怀中的那一刻，她忘了一切。

哦，她是个有夫之妇，真是可恨，更可恨的是他们两个人都不是自由身。她不喜欢他的妻子，凯蒂漫无目的的思绪现在有那么一会儿落在了多萝西·汤森身上。叫多萝西这个名字可真是不怎么样！它是那么老气横秋，她至少三十八岁了，但是查理从不提她。当然，他也不在乎她，她让他烦得要死。但他是个绅士，丝毫没表现出嫌弃他妻子的样子。凯蒂充满感情又有些鄙夷地微笑着：这可真是他的做派，傻乎乎的老家伙，他可以对她不忠，但他又绝不会说出一个瞧不起她的字儿。多萝西是个高个子的女人，比凯蒂要高，既不胖也不瘦，淡褐色的头发很浓密。除了年龄还不算太大以外，她跟漂亮从不沾边。她的身材保持得很好，没有发福，蓝色的眼睛冷冷的，肤色让人没法看第二眼，脸颊上没有血色。但是她的穿着嘛，嗯，和她作为香港殖民地大臣助理妻子的身份还算匹配。想到这里，凯蒂笑了起来，还略微耸了耸肩。

当然，没人会否认多萝西·汤森有一副动人的嗓音，她也是一位好母亲，查理总是提到这一点，也就是凯蒂的母亲所说的淑女。但是，凯蒂并不喜欢她，也不喜欢她随意的举止。和你在一起的时候，她会礼貌地招待你，请你喝茶或者留下来吃饭，但就是这种礼貌会让你感到恼火，因为你能感觉到她根本没把你放在心上。凯蒂心想，她什么都不在乎，只在乎她的孩子们。她的两个儿子在英国上学，明年她还会把跟着她的六岁大的儿子也送回英国。她的脸仿佛戴着面具，她会边微笑着，边用她甜美的声音和礼貌的态度谈论符合她身份的事情，但是显然缺乏热诚，使你产生距离感。她在香港有几个闺中密友，她们都特别喜欢她。凯蒂想搞清在汤森太太的眼中，是否她多少有点儿出身寒酸，想到这里，她不禁脸有点儿红了。但多萝西也不该有什么理由来端架子，虽说她的父亲曾经官至殖民地的总督，当然在位时确实很风光——当他走进房间时，每个人都会起立；当他走过人们的身旁乘车离开时，男人们都会脱下帽子致敬——但是还有什么比一个退了休的殖民地总督更不起眼的呢？多萝西的父亲现在靠退休金度日，住在伯爵广场地区的一栋小房子里。凯蒂的母亲并不常让她回家看看，如果她去了，她母亲反而觉得无聊透顶。凯蒂的父亲，伯纳德·贾斯汀是一位王室法律顾问，有朝一日成为一名法官是水到渠成的事，他们一家住在南肯辛顿富人区。





第四章


凯蒂婚后和丈夫来到了香港，却发现一时很难适应这里的社交场合，因为她的社交地位是由其丈夫的职业所决定的。当然每个人都对她很好，有那么两三个月他们夫妇几乎每天晚上都要参加聚会。在政府官邸出席晚宴时，总督对待她就像对待新娘子一般。但是她自己很快就明白了，作为一名政府雇用的细菌学家的妻子，其实大家并没把她太当回事，这让她很是郁闷。

“真是太荒唐了，”她对自己的丈夫说，“唉，这儿的人几乎没有人愿意来咱们家，如果来了待上五分钟都觉得麻烦。我母亲绝对不会愿意邀请他们到我们家来吃饭的。”

“你不必为这么点儿小事烦心。”他回答道，“真的无所谓。”

“当然无所谓啦，这只能显得他们很愚蠢。过去在英国时，大家都争着来我们家吃饭，而在这儿，我们被当作垃圾，这也太滑稽了。”

“从社交的立场上看，科学家就是微不足道的。”他笑着回答道。

她现在知道了这点，可当初嫁给他时，她还没明白这个道理。

“我还不知道自己是被半岛东方邮轮公司的代理人带着去出席晚宴的，这确实让我感到好笑。”为了让她的话听上去不那么势利，她笑着说道。

也许他听出了她故意显得轻松的话语中责备的含义，他拉起她的一只手，不好意思地放在自己的掌心里。

“我真的很抱歉，亲爱的凯蒂，别郁闷了，好吗？”

“噢，我不会再胡思乱想了。”





第五章


下午的神秘人物不会是沃尔特的，一定是某个仆人，而且不管怎样他们也不会把它当回事的。这些中国仆人知道一切，但他们不会胡说八道的。

当她回想起白色的瓷把手慢慢转动的情景，她的心跳又开始加快了。他们下次一定不会冒这个险了，还是去古董店见面更安全些。看见她进去的人不会胡乱猜想，在那儿他们绝对安全。店主知道查理的身份，他不会傻到在殖民地大臣助理的背后嚼舌头，但是如果查理爱她，这些事又有什么关系呢？

她从阳台转过身去，走回了起居室，一屁股坐到沙发上，伸出手想去拿一支香烟，突然看到一本书上放着一张便条。她把纸条打开，上面用铅笔写着：





亲爱的凯蒂：

这本书是你想看的。我正打算把它给你送来时，碰巧遇到了费恩博士，他说正好要路过自己家，他可以把书捎给你。

V. H．





她摇了摇铃，当男仆进来时，她着急地问他是谁把这本书放到这儿的，什么时候放的。

“是老爷带来的书，夫人，在午饭后。”他回答道。

那个人一定就是沃尔特了。她马上抄起了电话，拨通了殖民地大臣办公室的电话找查理，告诉他刚刚了解到的情况。有一段时间他没有说话。

“我该怎么办？”她问道。

“我正跟人商量重要的事情，恐怕现在不能和你说话，我建议你先按兵不动。”

她放下了听筒，知道他不是一个人待着，但她对他的那些事有些不耐烦。

她又在一张书桌旁坐了下来，把脸埋在手掌里想把目前的状况好好捋一下。当然沃尔特可能只是认为她正在睡觉，她把门锁上也不是说不通。她设法回想他们是不是一直在说话，当然他们即使在说话也是压低了声音的。还有帽子，查理真可恨，把它落在了楼下。然而，再为此责怪他也没用，顺手一放也很正常，没有什么迹象表明沃尔特已经注意到了它。他可能回来得匆忙，只是放下了书和便条，就离开去办和他工作相关的事了。奇怪的是，他应该先推门，然后才去开那两扇窗户。如果他想到她睡着了，不太可能去打扰她的。她真是个大傻瓜！

她又开始发抖了，心里再一次感到了甜蜜的痛楚，每次她想到查理的时候，这种感觉总是在心头涌现，但她觉得值得。他说过会站到她的身边，如果事情到了不可收拾的地步，好吧……如果沃尔特要闹，就让他大闹一场吧。她拥有查理，她还在乎什么呢？或许让他知道最好不过了，自从她爱上查理以后，就根本不在乎沃尔特了，而且丈夫的殷勤已经使她烦恼和感到讨厌，她想和他彻底划清界限。她不知道他能找出什么证据，如果他指控她出轨，她会矢口否认，如果局面极度尴尬，她就不再抵赖，好吧，她会一股脑儿告诉他真相，让他自己看着办。





第六章


结婚不到三个月，她就知道自己犯了个错误。但与其说是她的错，还不如说是她母亲的错。

房间里有一张她母亲的照片，凯蒂厌烦的目光落到了上面。她不知道为什么自己要把它放在那儿，其实她并不喜欢自己的母亲。她家里还有一张父亲的照片，但放在楼下的大钢琴上面。她父亲的照片是在被任命为王室律师时照的，他头戴假发，身着长袍，但即使如此场合和穿戴，也没能使他显得威风凛凛。他身材矮小、干瘦，目光疲惫，上嘴唇很长，两片嘴唇都偏薄。一个爱逗乐的摄影师告诉他要看上去开心点儿，可他看上去却更严肃了。正是由于这个原因，贾斯汀太太觉得她丈夫下垂的嘴角和忧郁的眼神，给了他一种平和而又不苟言笑的神气，使他看上去有种廉明公正的样子，正是可以做个法官的明证之一。然而，她自己的照片是在她丈夫成为王室的律师后，受邀进宫时照的，她身着天鹅绒的长袍，长期的训练显出了优势，她头发上插着羽毛，手上拿着一大把花，腰板挺得直直的。她是五十岁的妇人了，身材很瘦，胸很平，颧骨突出，大鼻子，却很有型；一头茂密而又光滑的黑发，凯蒂早就怀疑她的头发可能是染过的，至少也是仔细修剪过的；黑亮的双眼不停地转动，这可能是她身上最引人注目的部分了，她跟你说话的时候，你在她那张冷漠的、不显皱纹的、发黄的脸上看到一双骨碌乱转的眼睛，会感到困惑不安的。这双眼睛对你上上下下打量，一会儿转到屋里其他人身上，过了一会儿又重新回到你身上，你会感觉她正在挑你身上的刺，正在评价你，同时她又对周围的人和事充满警觉，说的话也往往言不由衷。





第七章


贾斯汀太太是个强硬、冷酷、控制欲强、野心勃勃、吝啬而又愚蠢的女人。她的父亲是利物浦的一位律师，生了五个女儿，贾斯汀太太是其中之一。伯纳德·贾斯汀是在北部巡回法庭的任上遇见她的，那时，他似乎年轻有为，而她的父亲说他日后会飞黄腾达的。然而，事与愿违，他一直默默无闻，虽然他很勤勉、努力、有能力，但没有向上爬的愿望。贾斯汀太太挺瞧不上他的，但她不得不酸溜溜地承认，她若想达到某种目的也只能通过自己的丈夫。于是，她把自己视为车夫，而她的丈夫则是那架载着她驶向自己想要的生活的马车。她在他的耳旁喋喋不休，毫不留情。她发现如果想让伯纳德做他不愿做的事情，她唯一需要做的就是让他片刻不得安生，最后在筋疲力尽之下，他也就屈服了。在她看来，她的使命就是栽培那些可能对自己有用的人，她会去巴结可能向她丈夫引介案子的律师们，跟这些律师的妻子们打成一片。她对法官和他们的太太卑躬屈膝，对有可能发达的政客们更是阿谀奉承。

二十五年来，贾斯汀太太从未因为喜欢某人而邀请他来家里吃饭。但每隔一段时间她就会举办盛大的晚宴。可是吝啬和野心在她的性格中同时占有很重要的地位，她对花钱深恶痛绝。她还自诩只花一半的钱就能办出同样豪华的晚会。她的晚宴冗长、花样众多，但是很省钱，她坚信当人们边吃边高谈阔论时，是不会知道自己喝的是什么的，所以她会把发泡的摩泽尔酒用餐巾包上，以为客人们会把它当成香槟酒喝掉。

伯纳德的业务规模不大，也还算不错，但很多他的后辈都远远地超越了他。贾斯汀太太想让他竞选议员，虽说竞选的花销由党内负担，但在这件事上，她的吝啬再次压倒了野心，她无法让自己投入足够的资金来取悦选民，而伯纳德作为一名候选人，在庞大的竞选基金中所出的资金总是少那么一点儿，所以落选了。虽然假如成为一名议员夫人会让贾斯汀太太很开心，但对落选的失望，她以坚忍的意志面对了。她丈夫的参选让她接触到了很多了不起的大人物，她很感激这增加了自己的社交资本。她其实心里明白伯纳德绝无可能进入议会的，她之所以想让他参选只是为了赚取他所属的党派对伯纳德的感激之情，因为肯定落选的两三席中必定有他的份儿。

然而，他依然还是个初级律师，很多比他年轻的人已经成了王室律师。他也应该成为王室律师，这是很必要的，不仅仅是因为不先成为王室律师，就不太可能有朝一日成为法官，而且不成为王室律师和她为丈夫设计的发展方向也不符。赴宴时要排在比她年轻十岁的妇人后面，让她感到屈辱。但是在这点上，她和自己丈夫的观点相左，而且他的固执己见让她多年来都没法适应。他害怕徒有王室律师的虚名，丢掉了实际的收入。他告诉她，一鸟在手，胜过双鸟在林。而她反驳说，这个谚语只是他没出息的托词。他暗示她，如果担任了王室律师，他的收入可能会减半，但他也明白她的大道理比他多得多，说什么她也不会听的。她称他优柔寡断，让他片刻不得安宁，最后跟以往一样，他还是投降了。他去申请了王室律师头衔，很快就得到了。

他的担心证明是对的，他向上爬的路径困难重重，而手头接的案子日渐减少，但他设法隐藏了他感觉到的失望，他如果想责怪自己的妻子也只是在心里默默念叨，虽然平常在家时，他总是不怎么吭声，但现在他变得更加沉默寡言了。家里没人注意到他身上的这种变化，女儿们除了把他看作是收入的来源以外，没人尊重他。他得养家糊口，当牛做马，这似乎是再自然不过的事了，他得给她们提供衣食住行的费用、度假的花销，以及日常的零花钱。而现在由于他的过错，钱来得比以前少了，除了对他漠不关心外，她们心里对他又多了一层埋怨和蔑视。她们从来不曾想过这位顺从的矮小男人心里想的是什么。他每天早早出门上班，晚上准时回家换衣吃饭。对于她们来说，他是个陌生人，但是因为他是她们的父亲，她们把他对她们的爱护和珍视视作天经地义、理所当然的事。





第八章


然而，贾斯汀太太不乏勇气，这种品质本身是令人钦佩的。她不会让圈子里的人，或者她那个世界的人，看到她因为希望的破灭而感到屈辱的窘相。她的生活方式从不改变，通过精打细算，她能够像以前那样，照常举办高调的晚宴，用她长久以来养成的、和以前一样的欢乐态度来招待朋友。她有一种别人用起来很难，而她得心应手的闲聊的本领，在社交场合她能左右逢源地招呼各色人等。在人群中间，她是个很有用处的客人，在聊天不能顺畅进行时，她总能恰到好处地找到新的话题，察言观色之后，她总能立马挑起打破尴尬沉默的重担。

现在看起来，伯纳德能当上高等法院的法官的希望很渺茫了，但他仍然有希望当上地方法院的法官，或者最不济也能在殖民地的法院中混个法官当当。与此同时，令贾斯汀太太聊以自慰的是看到了他被任命为威尔士某个城镇的刑事法院法官。可是，她还是把希望寄托在女儿们身上，靠着为她们安排一桩好婚事，她想一举把这一辈子的晦气统统去掉。她有两个女儿已经长成，凯蒂和多瑞丝，但多瑞丝长得不好看，鼻子太长，身材也不苗条，所以贾斯汀太太最多只能指望她嫁一个有体面工作、家境还不错的年轻人。

但凯蒂是个美人胚子，她年纪不大的时候就已经乖巧可爱了，一双大眼睛，乌黑的眼珠水汪汪的，扑闪扑闪地透着灵气，褐色的小鬈发泛着红色的微光，洁白而精致的牙齿，以及可爱的皮肤。她的容貌说不上是无可挑剔，因为下巴有点儿太宽，而她的鼻子虽说不像多瑞丝那样长，但有点儿太大。她的美丽很大程度上是因为年轻，而贾斯汀太太意识到必须在她尚处于豆蔻年华时就要给她寻个好婆家。凯蒂出落成一个大姑娘时，着实让人眼前一亮：她的皮肤仍然是最漂亮的地方，睫毛长长的，她在顾转流盼中瞟上你一眼，就能摄人心魄，让你融化在她的美目之中。她的神情中还有一种迷人的欢快，可以感染身边的人。贾斯汀太太把所有的感情一股脑儿地都寄托在了她的身上，这是一种苛刻的、拿手的、精于算计的感情，她擅长。贾斯汀太太有一个野心勃勃的梦想，她不只是要给她的女儿安排一桩好婚事，而是要安排一桩可以光宗耀祖的婚事。

凯蒂就是在这样一种环境中成长起来的，她很清楚自己会成为一个漂亮的女人，心里也很明白她母亲的意图，其实这也是她自己的愿望。她开始进入了这个圈子，在圈子里贾斯汀太太简直就是个奇才，她能让自己频频得到各种舞会的邀请，在那些舞会上她的女儿可能会钓到金龟婿。凯蒂也确实成功地吸引了大多数人的目光，她既快乐又美丽，很快就有十多个男人爱上了她。但是这些追求者中没有一个是合适的人选，凯蒂对他们施展魅力，对所有人都很友好，同时小心翼翼地跟每个人都若即若离。每个礼拜天的下午，南肯辛顿的会客厅中都挤满了爱慕她的年轻人，然而贾斯汀太太带着一丝冷酷的、赞许的微笑观察着，对她来说，不费吹灰之力就能让这些年轻人和凯蒂保持一定的距离。凯蒂准备和他们调情，而且在这些人中挑拨离间，从中取乐。当他们向她求婚时，毫无例外，她都很有技巧而又斩钉截铁地拒绝了他们。

她的第一个社交季就这样过去了，完美的求婚者没有出现。第二个社交季还是如此，但她还年轻，有足够的资本等待。贾斯汀太太告诉她的朋友们，女孩子到了二十一岁还嫁不出去，那可真是个悲哀。可是，第三个年头过去了，接着又是第四个年头。两三个执着的追求者又再次向凯蒂求婚，但他们仍然不名一文，还有一两个比凯蒂还要年轻的小伙子向她求婚，甚至还有一个退了休的印度公务员（他曾获印度帝国勋章，是位骑士，都五十三岁了）也向凯蒂求婚，但凯蒂都没有答应。她现在仍然是各个舞会的常客，她出现在温布尔登和王宫的舞会上，在爱斯科赛马会和亨利皇家赛船会上露面。虽然她自己能够玩得很开心，但依然没有一个地位和收入都能够让她满意的人向她求婚。贾斯汀太太逐渐变得不安起来，她注意到凯蒂开始吸引四十岁以上的男士了。她提醒凯蒂，一两年之后，她将不再年轻漂亮了，而年轻漂亮的姑娘总是会层出不穷。贾斯汀太太在家里一向想说什么就说什么，她刻薄地警告她的女儿，如果还不抓紧，慢慢地她会失去市场。

凯蒂耸了耸肩，她认为自己依然美貌如初，也许还更吸引人了，因为在过去的四年中，她已经学会如何更为得体地穿衣打扮，她还有大把的时间去慢慢选择。如果她动了嫁人的念头，会有一箩筐的小伙子在排着队等着她垂青。毫无疑问，如意郎君迟早会来到身边。然而，贾斯汀太太显然对形势的判断更为老到，而且她心里一直生气她的漂亮女儿已经错过了好机会，迫使她不得不把择婿的标准降得低一点儿。她以前对职员阶层的人士是瞧不上的，谈到他们时，她总是不屑一顾，但现在她开始注意身边年轻的律师或者商业精英了，指望他们的未来会大有前途，让她能够有信心重拾梦想。

凯蒂已经到了二十五岁了，仍然待字闺中。贾斯汀太太更加焦躁不安了，她开始经常动不动就给凯蒂脸子看，话也难听了。她问凯蒂还要让她的父亲养她多久，为了给她创造找到好丈夫的机会，他几乎花光了积蓄，而她的婚姻还是泡影。贾斯汀太太从来没想过，或许是她自己上赶着的态度，过分热心的做派，吓跑了那些登门拜访的富家子弟和有着贵族头衔的年轻继承人，她只是把凯蒂的失败归于凯蒂自己的愚蠢。这时轮到多瑞丝了，她的鼻子过长，身材也不好，舞也跳得差。而她初入社交圈，就成功地跟杰奥弗瑞·丹尼森订了婚，他是家里的独生子，父亲是一位很有钱的外科医生，在战争期间，曾获封准男爵的称号，杰奥弗瑞将继承这一封号——虽然一名医生获得准男爵的称号也并非光宗耀祖的事，但感谢上帝，封号就是封号——更别说杰奥弗瑞将会继承一笔十分丰厚的遗产了。

凯蒂一气之下嫁给了沃尔特·费恩。





第九章


她结识他已经有一段时间了，但从未过多地留意过他。她不记得什么时候，在什么地方两个人第一次相见，直到订婚后，他告诉她是在一次舞会上，他的一些朋友带他一起去的。她当然不会注意到他什么，如果她和他跳了一支舞，那仅仅是因为她的脾气好，很高兴和任何一个邀请她的人跳舞。可以说她根本不认识他。一两天以后，在另一场舞会上，他主动上前来搭话。然后，她意识到，她参加的每场舞会他都在场。

“你瞧，我已经至少和你跳了十几次舞了，你得告诉我你的名字了。”终于，她笑着对他说道。

他显然有点儿吃惊。

“你的意思是你还不知道我的名字？以前别人把我介绍给你过呀。”

“哦，但是人们在介绍时总是不那么清楚，假如你对我的名字也完全不知道，我一点儿也不感到奇怪。”

他向她微笑着，他的表情略显严肃，甚至有点儿冷峻，但他的笑容还是很温柔可亲的。

“我当然知道你的芳名。”他停顿了一小会儿，“你不觉得好奇吗？”他接下来又问道。

“像大多数的女人一样好奇。”

“你没有想过去问问别的什么人我的名字吗？”

她暗自觉得好笑，想知道凭什么他以为她会对他的尊姓大名感兴趣。但是，她还是乐意取悦别人的，所以她带着迷人的微笑用一双美目望着他，她的眼睛好似森林里露珠汇成的一潭池水，有着妩媚的亲切。

“那么，你叫什么名字？”

“沃尔特·费恩。”

她不知道他来舞会的原因，他的舞跳得不怎么好，而且似乎他也不认识舞会上的什么人。她曾闪过这样的念头，他一定是爱上她了，但很快她又打消了这个想法，耸了耸肩，她认识太多这样的女孩子了，以为她们遇到的每一个男人都会爱上自己，可是到头来总是发现自己的想法是那么荒诞可笑。可是，她还是开始越来越关注沃尔特了。当然，他的行为举止并不像爱上她的其他年轻人那样，那些年轻人大多数都直截了当地向她表白，而且都想亲吻她，也确实很多人这样做了。但是，沃尔特绝口不谈论她，也几乎不谈他自己，他相当安静。她并不介意，因为她总能滔滔不绝地说，而且当她看到她说的笑话逗得他哈哈大笑时，她自己也很开心。然而，他开口说话时，也并不愚蠢，只是很明显有些羞涩。似乎他住在东方某地，现在正在家里休假。

一个星期天的下午，他来到了凯蒂南肯辛顿的家中。家里已经有了十多个客人了，他坐了一会儿，显得有些局促不安，然后就起身离开了。凯蒂的母亲后来问起她那个人是谁。

“我也不是太清楚，是你邀请他来的吗？”

“是的，我在巴德利家遇见他的，他说在好几个舞会上见到过你，我说我每个星期天都会在家，欢迎他来。”

“他姓费恩，好像在东方有份工作。”

“没错，他是位医生，他爱上你了吗？”

“我发誓，我真的不知道。”

“当一个年轻人爱上你时，我觉得你是应该知道的。”

“就是他爱上了我，我也不会嫁给他的。”凯蒂轻描淡写地说道。

贾斯汀太太没有接话茬儿，她的一言不发就表明她很不高兴。凯蒂的脸唰地红了，她知道母亲现在并不在乎她嫁给谁了，只想让她赶紧嫁人。





第十章


在接下来的一周中，她在三场舞会上都遇见了他，现在他的羞涩也许消除了一些，变得稍微健谈些了。虽然他是个医生，但并不执业，他是个细菌学家（凯蒂对这份工作几乎一无所知），在香港工作，今年秋天还会回去。他跟凯蒂讲了很多关于中国的事情，而凯蒂也早已练就了一个本事，那就是无论别人跟她说什么，她都能做出听得津津有味的样子。不过确实，香港的生活听上去还是蛮不错的，那儿有俱乐部、网球场、赛马会，还可以打马球和高尔夫球。

“那儿的人经常办舞会吗？”

“哦，当然，舞会很多。”

她暗自揣摩，他跟她说这些事情是不是有所图。他似乎喜欢和她在一起，但又绝不会主动牵她的手，或者通过眼神或言语来表达他的感情。丝毫看不出他有要主动追求她的举动，好像她只是一位他遇到的、一块儿跳过舞的女孩。在接下来的那个星期天，他再次来到了凯蒂家。她的父亲碰巧进来了，因为外面下雨，他不能去打高尔夫球了，于是他和沃尔特有了一次长谈，她后来问她父亲他们谈了点儿什么。

“看样子他的工作地点在香港，那儿的首席大法官是我在法律界的一个老朋友，他似乎是个聪明的、非同寻常的年轻人。”

她心里明白，照常来说，她父亲对多年来不得不去应付接待的追求她的那些年轻人烦得要死，现在她妹妹的追求者也令他如此。

“父亲，对那些围在我身边的年轻人你是通常都不怎么喜欢的呀。”她说道。

他慈祥而疲倦的目光落在她身上。

“如果有可能，你会嫁给他吗？”

“肯定不会。”

“他爱上你了吗？”

“他没有表露出来。”

“你喜欢他吗？”

“我觉得不怎么喜欢。他经常让我有点儿不爽。”

他根本不是她喜欢的那种类型，个头不高，但也不怎么胖，反而有点儿偏瘦，皮肤略黑，轮廓清晰规矩，身材匀称，整齐体面。他的眼珠几乎是黑色的，眼睛不大，并不经常转动，目光落到的地方，总是带着特别专注的神色；眼睛里虽然透着好奇，但不是很喜庆；鼻子笔直、精致，前庭饱满，嘴也很有型，他应该是长得比较耐看的，但让人匪夷所思的是，实际上他给人的感觉并非如此。当凯蒂开始认真地考虑他的长相时，她也觉得有点儿吃惊，如果单看他的五官，每个都很好，可合到一起，反而不是想当然的英俊。他的表达中稍微带有一些讥讽的味道，随着凯蒂对他的了解逐渐增多，她意识到自己和他在一起时，并不很放松，他身上没有快乐的细胞。

伴随着社交季节接近尾声，他们已经见了很多次面了，但是他还是跟以往一样，对她仍然保持着不冷不热、若即若离的态度。准确地说，他和她在一起时不再那么不好意思了，但是还是拘谨，所说的话仍然是不自然的、干巴巴的。凯蒂最后得出了结论，他根本没有爱上她，他只是喜欢她，发现她是个容易交流的对象，等到了十一月份他回中国时，就会把她忘到脑后了。她觉得很可能他会一直和香港医院中的某个护士保持暧昧的关系，或者找一个牧师的女儿，虽然这些女子乏味、相貌平平、扁平足，甚至小里小气，但的确适合做他的妻子。

后来，杰奥弗瑞·丹尼森宣布与多瑞丝订婚，多瑞丝才十八岁，就订了一桩门当户对的婚事，而凯蒂都二十五岁了，还是单身，假如她一辈子都嫁不出去该怎么办？那个社交季只有一个还在牛津大学学习的二十岁男孩向她求婚，而她不可能嫁给一个比她自己还小五岁的男孩。她已经把自己的婚事搞得一团糟了。去年她拒绝了一个有着巴斯骑士封号的鳏夫的求婚，虽然这个男人还带着三个孩子，但是如今她希望当初要是答应下来就好了。她母亲现在愈发变本加厉了，而多瑞丝，以前因为母亲把嫁个好人家的宝都押在了凯蒂身上，处处得让着凯蒂，现在她在凯蒂面前趾高气扬了起来。凯蒂的心好像掉入了冰窟窿里。





第十一章


然而，一天午后，她在从哈罗德家步行回家的途中，在布罗姆顿路上碰巧遇见了沃尔特。他停下脚步，跟她攀谈起来。随后，他像是很随意地问她是否愿意和他一起去公园走走。她也不是特别想回家，而且公园也确实是个让人惬意的地方，于是他们一边溜达，一边像以往一样聊着天。他问她夏天打算去哪儿度假。

“哦，我们一家总是去乡下待上一段时间，你知道，忙完一个周期的工作，我父亲会很累，我们只能去那些能找到的最安静的地方。”

凯蒂虚情假意又略带自我解嘲地说道，因为她很清楚她父亲的工作量并不怎么满，不会累着的，甚至家里都不会为选择度假的地点而去征求他的意见，不过安静的地方往往就是便宜的地方。

“你不认为那些椅子在向我们发出邀请吗？”沃尔特突然说道。

她顺着他的目光看去，在不远处树下的草坪上有两把空着的椅子。

“那我们去坐会儿吧。”她说道。

但当他们坐下来以后，他似乎又变得高深莫测起来，真是个怪人。不过，她还是心情不错地一边聊着天，一边在心中揣摩他邀请她一起到公园散步的原因，也许他打算向她吐露他自己对远在香港的某个扁平足护士的爱情。突然，他转向了她，在她说到半截的时候打断了她，她虽然不知道他要说什么，但明白他没有在听她的话，而且他的脸变得刷白。

“有些话我想对你说。”

她很快地看了他一眼，发现他的眼睛里充满了痛苦的焦虑。他的声音变得紧张、低沉，还有点儿语无伦次。可是在她能够思考他的这种激动由来之前，他再一次开了口。

“我想问你是否愿意嫁给我。”

“你吓着我了。”她吃惊地回答说，茫然地望着他。

“你看不出来吗，我早就爱上了你？”

“你从来没有表露出来呀。”

“我笨嘴拙舌，总是发现词不达意。”

她的心跳开始加快，以前经常有人向她求婚，但不管这些人求婚时是兴高采烈，还是多愁善感，她总能用相同的方式回答，还从来没有人用这样一种突如其来、还带着某种奇怪的悲剧色彩的方式向她求婚。

“你真的太好了。”她迟疑不决地回答道。

“我第一次见到你，就爱上了你，我也早就想向你表白，但总也鼓不起勇气。”

“我不能确定这么做好不好。”她咯咯地笑了起来。

她很高兴能有机会笑上一小会儿了，因为在这个阳光灿烂的晴朗日子，周围的气氛似乎突然笼罩在浓重的不祥之兆中，他的眉头紧锁。

“哦，你知道我的意思，我不想放弃希望，但是现在你快要走了，而在秋天我也不得不回到中国去。”

“可我从来没有把你看作是追求者。”她无助地说道。

他不再说话了，低着头阴沉地看着草地。他确实是个怪人，不过现在他已经告诉她了一切，而且是以某种她觉得神秘的方式来表白，他的这种爱也是她以前从未碰到过的。她有点儿受到了惊吓，但同时也有些暗自得意，他的泰然自若还隐约留在她的印象中呢。

“你得给我时间让我考虑考虑。”

他依然一动不动，也没有说话，他该不会想让她就在这里做出决定吧？那也太荒唐了，她必须和母亲商量一下。说这话时她本该站起身来，但她还是坐在那儿，等着他的回答。现在她发现，不知道为什么很难再动一动身子了，她没有看他，但能够感觉到他表情的变化。她以前从来没有想到会嫁给一个个头只比自己高那么一点儿的男人。当你紧挨着他坐在一起的时候，能看到他外表俊朗，不苟言笑，当你意识到在他内心中有着摧枯拉朽般强烈的激情时，会觉得很奇怪。

“我不了解你，一点儿都不了解你。”她声音颤抖地说道。

他看着凯蒂，而凯蒂不知不觉也被他的目光所吸引，她以前在他的眼睛中从来没见到过这种温柔，但同时还有某种乞求的成分在里面，就像一条被鞭打的狗，而这一点又有点儿惹恼了她。

“我觉得已经跟你很熟了呢。”他说道。

“可你还是挺害羞的，不是吗？”

显然，这是她遇到过的最奇特的求婚了。尽管如此，在这样的场合下，对她来说他们彼此间的谈话无论如何也该打住了。她一点儿也不爱他，她不知道为什么不当场拒绝他，还显得犹犹豫豫。

“我真是个笨蛋。”他说，“我想告诉你，我对你的爱胜过世上的一切，但我又发现这很难说出口。”

另一件奇怪的事也发生了，那就是她莫名地有些感动，让人觉得难以理解。当然了，他并非真的冷漠，只是他的行事方式不幸给人造成了这种印象，在那一时刻，她对他的厌恶没有增加，反而更喜欢他了。再说，多瑞丝在十一月份结婚，那时他也要回中国去了，如果她嫁给他，当然要和他一起去中国，这样在多瑞丝的婚礼上她就不会当伴娘了，这一点还是不错的，因为她很高兴能够摆脱这些事情，而且要是多瑞丝嫁人了，她自己还单身，这让人情何以堪！大家都知道多瑞丝有多年轻，这就让她显得更老气横秋了。她竟然嫁不出去，虽然对她来说，嫁给沃尔特不是太理想的婚姻，但毕竟她出嫁了，而她婚后会住在中国，使得这桩婚事变得更加简单，她害怕她母亲的毒舌。唉，跟她一起长大的所有女孩都早已嫁人，大多数的人还有了孩子，她懒得去看她们，也厌倦她们没完没了地谈论自己的孩子。沃尔特会带给她新的生活，她微笑着向他转过身去，她深知这样做所产生的效果。

“如果我不顾后果地答应嫁给你，你想什么时候娶我？”

他突然惊喜地喘了口气，刚才煞白的脸现在涨得通红。

“现在，马上，越快越好，我们可以在八月份和九月份去意大利度蜜月。”

那样就省去她和父母去乡下牧师的小屋了，小屋的租金一周才五个几尼。一瞬间，在想象中她仿佛看见《晨报》上登出了布告：由于新郎要返回东方工作，婚礼即刻举办。她非常了解自己的母亲，她一定会让此事引起轰动，至少在那一刻，多瑞丝会作为陪衬，而当多瑞丝盛大的婚礼举办时，她已经远走高飞了。

她伸出了手。

“我觉得自己很喜欢你，但你要给我时间让我适应你。”

“那就是说，你答应啦？”他打断了她的话。

“我想是的。”





第十二章


她那时对他了解得很少，而现在，虽然他们已经结婚将近两年了，但是她对他的了解也就多了一点点。起初，她被他的善良和奉承感动，对他的热情甚至有点儿感到意外。他特别体贴，格外关注她的感受，只要她张口，哪怕是鸡毛蒜皮的小事，他也会忙不迭地去满足。他还经常给她一些小礼物。当她不巧病了，没人会比他更体贴入微的了。要是她能够给他一些为她排忧解难的机会，似乎是在给他恩惠。而且他总是对她彬彬有礼，她走进屋里，他会站起身，她下车时，他总是用手搀扶着她，如果碰巧在街上遇到她，他还会脱帽致敬。当她离开房间时，他会很关切地为她开门，只要进入她的卧室或者闺房，他一定会先敲门，他对待凯蒂，一点儿也不像她见过的大多数丈夫对待妻子那样，而像是同去乡间别墅度假的客人，虽然有点儿滑稽，但还是让人感觉很受用的。可如果他能更随意些，反而能让凯蒂有和他在过日子的感觉。他们的夫妻关系并没有让她觉得和他更为亲近，他那时热情似火，也还有些怪怪的歇斯底里和多愁善感。

让她感到不安的是她认识到他真的很情绪化，他的自我控制要么是因为害羞，要么是因为长期的训练，她不明白到底是哪一种原因。当她躺在他的怀抱中时，他的欲望好像得到了满足，平时怯懦的他会说一些唐突的事情，担心会被看成是荒唐可笑的人，所以用小孩的语气说出来，这似乎让她有点儿对他不屑。她曾经有一次深深地伤害了他，她嘲笑他说，他说的净是吓人的胡话，话刚一说完，她觉得他抱着她的双臂马上松软了下来，他好一会儿一言不发，随后放开了她，径直走回了卧室。她不想伤害他的感情，所以过了一两天后，她对他说：

“你这个傻家伙，我才不介意你对我说的那些胡话呢。”

他不好意思地笑了笑。她随即发现他对这事还不能完全释怀。沃尔特的自我意识很强，在聚会上，每个人都开始唱歌了，可他无法融入其中，他坐在一边微笑着，表现出很愉快、觉得好玩的样子，但他的笑是硬挤出来的，更像是略带讥讽的假笑，让你禁不住觉得，在他眼中，那些自娱自乐的人是一群傻瓜。他自己不会参与集体游戏，而凯蒂会兴致勃勃地觉得这些游戏很好玩。在回中国的旅途中，有一次假面舞会，每个人都化装打扮，可他就是死活不肯穿上奇装异服，也显然认为整个活动无聊透顶，这不免扫了凯蒂的兴。

凯蒂是个很活泼的人，她愿意整天都跟人聊天，也很爱笑。他的沉默寡言让她觉得不安。她经常会说个不停，可他根本不搭腔，这让凯蒂很是恼火，虽然凯蒂的唠叨有时确实不需要搭腔，但有去言而无回应总是会让人不爽。比如外面下雨了，她会说：“真是瓢泼大雨。”她可能会希望他回应：“可不是吗？真是这样。”但他一言不发。有时，她真想去扇他几巴掌。

“我说外面下瓢泼大雨了。”她重复道。

“我听见你说了。”他怜爱地笑着回应道。

这表示他无意冒犯她，他没吭声不过是因为确实无话可说。但是，如果每个人只有在有话时才说出来，那么人类很快就会失去语言能力，凯蒂带着微笑暗自思忖。





第十三章


当然，实际上他没有魅力，这也是他不怎么受欢迎的原因。她到了香港不久就发现了这一点，而且对他工作的认识依然模糊，但她能充分认识到，而且毫无疑问地明白，一个政府部门的细菌学家并非什么了不起的人物。他似乎没有和她讨论一下工作——这可是生活的一部分——的愿望。在一开始她还愿意问他一些工作方面的事，也显得很感兴趣，而他打个哈哈就把她敷衍过去了。

“那太枯燥了，完全是技术性的东西。”他有一次说道，“而且报酬非常低。”

他非常内向。她所知道的有关他的经历、出生、教育背景，和在遇见她之前的生活，都是她直截了当向他提问才打听出来的。奇怪的是，似乎让他唯一不快的就是她冷不丁的一个问题。而那个时候，她天性好奇，会连珠炮似的提问，而他的回答，一个比一个唐突。凯蒂很聪明，知道他答非所问并不是想对她隐瞒什么，而仅仅是出于天性，愿意保留一块隐秘之地。谈论他自己也让他觉得厌烦，还让他羞怯和不舒服，他不知道如何向外人敞开心扉。他喜欢读书，但他读的书在凯蒂眼中似乎很乏味，他不忙着写科学论文的时候，会读一些有关中国或者历史方面的书。他没有放松的时候，她觉得他生性中就没有放松这根弦。但他也有喜欢的运动和游戏，就是打网球和桥牌。

她纳闷他怎么会爱上自己，也无法想象自己怎么会嫁给这样一个内向、冷漠而镇静的男人，简直没有谁比她更不适合他的了。但是，有一点可以肯定，那就是他疯狂地爱着她，会不顾一切地取悦她，他有如她手上的熔蜡，可以被她随心所欲地塑造，她想让他怎样他便会怎样，她都有点儿蔑视他了。她想知道，他冷嘲热讽的习惯，对她所崇拜的人和事所带有的某种鄙视的容忍，是否仅仅是一种假象，来掩盖他骨子里的软弱。她觉得他人很聪明，大家似乎也都这样认为。但是少有的几次他和两三个自己喜欢的人在一起时兴致高起来，除此以外，她从来没有发现他真正开心过。确切地说，他并不是厌烦她，而是对她心不在焉。





第十四章


虽然凯蒂在不同的茶会上碰到过查理·汤森的太太，但是在她到了香港几周之后才见到查理本人。当她和丈夫一起去查理家赴宴时，人们把她介绍给了他。凯蒂当时心存戒备，查理·汤森是殖民地大臣助理，她不想让他居高临下地看待她。虽然汤森太太对她还是彬彬有礼的，但凯蒂能够察觉到她有点儿看不起她。接待凯蒂夫妇的房间很宽敞，家具摆设和她在香港所去过的其他人家的客厅一样，都是一种家庭气氛浓厚的舒适风格。那次的聚会规模很大，他们是最后一拨到的客人。进入客厅后，身着制服的仆人们在人群中穿梭，给客人们端鸡尾酒、送橄榄果。汤森太太很随意地招呼着他们，看着客人名单告诉沃尔特有人会把他领到餐桌旁。

凯蒂看到一位个头较高、长相十分英俊的男人向他们走来。

“这位是我丈夫。”

“我将有幸坐在您身边。”他说道。

她立即放松了下来，心底里的敌意也消失得无影无踪。他的眼睛里也带着微笑，她同时也看出他的目光中闪过一抹吃惊的神色，她太了解这种神色了，但还是暗自想笑。

“饭我是吃不了了。”他说道，“即使我了解多萝西，饭菜一定特别可口。”

“为什么吃不了？”

“应该有人告诉我，真的早就应该有人提醒我了。”

“提醒什么？”

“没人跟我提一个字儿，我怎么会知道我要遇见一个大美人呢？”

“您这么说，让我说什么好呢？”

“什么也不用说，让我自说自话好了，我要一遍又一遍地说。”

凯蒂虽然未动声色，但心里好奇，关于自己，他的太太究竟跟他说了些什么？他一定问了她一些问题。查理用他那双含笑的眼睛低头望着她，猛然想起了什么。

“她长什么样？”当他的太太告诉他，她已经见到了费恩博士新婚的妻子以后，他问道。

“噢，很可爱的小人儿，明星范儿十足。”

“她是个演员吗？”

“哦，不是，我觉得她不是个演员。她的父亲是个医生，或者律师什么的，我记不太清了。我想我们应该邀请他们来参加宴会。”

“不着急，慢慢来，不是吗？”

当他们紧挨着坐在餐桌边上的时候，查理告诉凯蒂他刚来香港就认识沃尔特了。

“我们一起玩桥牌，在俱乐部中，他可是超一流的玩家。”

在回家的路上，她把这话告诉了沃尔特。

“你知道，他说得有点儿夸张。”

“他打得怎么样？”

“打得也不赖。他有一手好牌时，打得相当好，可有一手坏牌时，就打得一塌糊涂。”

“他打得和你一样好吗？”

“我对自己的牌技心中有数，我认为自己是二流玩家中打得相当不错的。而查理认为自己属于一流的玩家，实际上不是这样的。”

“你不喜欢他吗？”

“我说不上喜欢他，也不能说不喜欢。我觉得他工作还算可以，大家都说他是个运动健将，我对他兴趣不大。”

这已经不是第一次了，沃尔特无关痛痒的镇静让她感到恼火。她在心中自问，这样稳健世故有必要，有道理吗？对一个人，你要么喜欢，要么不喜欢。她就很喜欢查理·汤森，虽然她没有料到会这样。他可能在香港是最受欢迎的人了，可以预料，如果殖民地大臣不久后退休，大家都希望查理能够接替。他打网球、马球和高尔夫，也热衷赛马。他总是时刻准备对别人施以援手，决不让繁文缛节干扰办事的效率，也从不摆架子。凯蒂不知道为什么自己以前听到别人赞扬他都会觉得不以为然，她不禁想到他一定是个十分自负的家伙，她真是太傻了，看走了眼，他最不可能受到的指摘就是说他矜持傲慢。

整个晚上她都过得很愉快。他们谈到了伦敦的剧院，谈到了阿斯科特赛马大会和考斯帆船赛，谈到了她知道的一切事情，她觉得和他一见如故，真的好像在伦诺克斯花园中某个舒适的房子里两个人曾经见过面。后来，在宴会之后，男人们都去了客厅，他踱步过来，又坐到了她身边。虽然他不再说一些很好玩的事情，刚才已经让她笑个不停了，但还是用他一贯的说话方式和她聊着天，他的声音深沉、醇厚，有一种亲切感。在他善良、闪光的蓝色眼睛里，有着一种愉快的神色，让人觉得和蔼可亲，和他在一起很放松。当然，他身上还有一种魅力，使得他可爱、迷人。

他的个头很高，她觉得至少有六英尺二英寸，而且身材很匀称。显然，他的条件很好，身上没有一盎司的赘肉。他衣冠楚楚，是房间里穿着最得体的男士，可见他平时很注意穿着打扮。她喜欢男士看上去很精神的样子，她的目光在沃尔特的身上打量了一番——他真的应该好好捯饬一下了。她注意到查理衬衣的袖扣和马甲上的纽扣，以前她在卡地亚的商店里也见过类似的款式，当然这是因为汤森家族还有很多私人产业。他的脸被晒得黝黑，但太阳显然并没有带走他脸颊上健康的颜色。她喜欢他那修剪得很整齐的弯卷的小胡子，以及并未被胡子遮住的红嘴唇。他的短发乌黑，梳理得溜光水滑。当然还有他的眼睛，在浓眉之下是他最迷人之处：眼珠湛蓝，带着含笑的温柔，让人感受到他性格中的体贴。有这样一双蓝眼睛的人是不会忍心伤害任何人的。她分明知道自己也给他留下了好印象，即使他还没有向她说出什么迷人的话语，但他的眼睛，带着崇拜的暖意，已经暴露了心底的秘密。他的放松自如也让人愉快，而他自己似乎并没有察觉。凯蒂对这种氛围感到很惬意，她也欣赏这样的方式，在作为聊天主料的打趣中，他时不时地会用上一两句听上去极为顺耳的奉承话。当她和他握手告别时，她明白无误地感觉到了他手上的力度。

“我希望我们不久之后就能再次见到您。”他很随意地说道，但他的眼神在说这话时显得意味深长，她不可能不明白。

“香港真的很小，不是吗？”她说道。





第十五章


当时谁能想得到在短短的三个月内他们的关系就发展到这种程度呢？他后来告诉她，在第一次遇到她的那个傍晚，他就对她着了迷。她是他所见过的最漂亮的女人，他甚至还记得那天她穿的衣服，那身衣服实际上是她的结婚礼服。他还说，她看上去就像山谷中的百合花。在他表白之前，她就知道他爱上了自己，但有一点儿害怕，所以总跟他保持一定的距离。他在冲动时，很难让人拒绝。她害怕让他吻她，因为一想到他的双臂抱着她，她的心会怦怦直跳，她以前没有像这样爱过谁，爱情真是太美妙了。她明白了爱情是什么，便突然因沃尔特给她的爱而有些同情他。有时她半开玩笑地揶揄查理，发现他还挺乐在其中的。曾经一度她兴许还有点儿怕他，但现在她对他们的关系变得更有信心了。她取笑他，让她觉得好玩的是，她能看见他从一开始受到打趣时的一愣，到嘴角慢慢绽开笑容，显得又吃惊又开心。在那些日子里，她认为他更加具有男人味了。她已经明白激情的效果，现在能够轻松自如地操纵它了。就像竖琴师用手指划过琴弦，拨动他的爱情，当看到自己竟然让他如此尴尬和困惑时，她会哈哈大笑。

当查理成为她的情人后，她自己和沃尔特之间的情形反而显得很荒唐。她几乎不再看他一眼，他还是那么严肃，充满自制，不苟言笑。然而，她和查理在一起后太开心了，都无法不对沃尔特也和颜悦色起来。毕竟，如果不是沃尔特，她绝不会认识查理。在最终突破底线之前，她曾犹豫了很长一段时间，倒不是因为她不想屈服于查理的激情——她也同样爱他——而是因为她从小所处的环境和生活中所有的道德传统使她感到害怕。她后来（最后越过雷池事出偶然，其实并不是两个人刻意安排的，机会的到来也出乎他们的意料）很诧异地发现，她自己事后并没有觉得和原来的她有什么不同。她原以为自己会产生某种奇妙的变化，尽管还不知道这种变化到底是什么，因为她觉得要是换了别人也会发生这种变化的，而当她有机会在镜子中端详自己时，困惑地发现镜子中的女人和以前的那个女人并无二致。

“你生我的气吗？”他问她。

“我太爱你了。”她小声说道。

“你不觉得浪费那么多时间在我身上太傻了吗？”

“我确实太傻了。”





第十六章


她的喜悦，有时几乎让她无法抑制，让她又重新拥有了美丽。她就在结婚之前，开始失去光鲜靓丽，看上去疲惫又憔悴。心怀恶意的人说她的青春正在逝去。这就是一个二十五岁的女孩和一个已婚妇人的不同，她犹如一朵玫瑰的花蕾，花瓣的边缘已经开始变黄了，但恰恰就在这时她像一朵盛开的玫瑰突然绽放了。她闪亮的双眸更加风情万种，她的皮肤（本来是她最值得骄傲也是小心呵护的地方）更加光洁，你甚至不好把它比作鲜嫩的桃子或者花朵，因为话应该反过来说，鲜桃和花朵才能和凯蒂的皮肤相媲美。她看上去重新回到了十八岁，回到了正当青春焕发的年华。对于这一点无人不看在眼里，她的女友们有一搭无一搭地问她是否打算要一个孩子。那些对她爱答不理的人，曾经评论她还算漂亮，不过鼻子太长，现在都不得不承认，他们误判了她，她就像查理第一次见到她时所说的那样，是个大美人。

他们想方设法地维持着这种暧昧关系，他告诉她他的靠山[1]很硬。“我不想听你卖弄你的身材。”她轻松地打断他的话。对他来说没有什么大不了的，但考虑到她的原因，他们不能冒哪怕是最小的风险。他们不能经常单独见面，他想天天见到她，但他不得不首先为她着想。有时他们在古董店见面，有时在午饭后她家里没人时见面。但是她经常能在公开场合见到他，让她感到好笑的是，在这些场合他总是一本正经地跟她说话，虽然显得很愉快，但实际上他总是用这种方式和身边的每个人说话。谁能想象得到就在刚才，他还用双臂紧紧地抱着她，在她的耳边说着情话和逗趣的话呢？

她崇拜他。在打马球时，他脚蹬铮亮的名牌马靴，身着白色马裤，气宇轩昂；在打网球时，他身穿网球衣，看上去就像个大男孩。显然，他对自己的身材还是引以为傲的，这是她所见过的最好的身材。为保持这个身材，他也是煞费苦心，他从不吃面包、土豆或者黄油，而且还经常锻炼。她喜欢他对自己的双手精心保养的方式，每周他都要修剪一次指甲。他还是一名出色的运动员，去年曾获得当地的网球冠军。当然，他还是她遇到过的舞跳得最好的舞伴，她做梦都想和他一起翩翩起舞。没人会想到他已经四十岁出头了，她告诉他她就不相信他已人到中年了。

“我看你完全是在唬人，你看上去真的只有二十五岁。”

他笑了，很是开心。

“哦，亲爱的，我儿子都十五岁了，我已经是个中年人了，再过上个两三年，我就变成一个胖老头了。”

“你就是到了一百岁，也会人见人爱的。”

她喜欢他浓黑的眉毛，也好奇是否就是这些浓眉让他的蓝眼睛有着让人意乱情迷的魅力。

他充满才情，钢琴弹得相当好，当然，最拿手的是爵士乐，他还能用高亢男声和幽默举止唱一首诙谐的歌曲。她相信他无所不能，他能非常聪明地处理工作，当他告诉她，在他解决完某个难题后总督向他表示特别祝贺时，她分享他的喜悦。

“提起这种事，只有我能办到。”他笑着说，眼里带着对她迷人的爱意，“在政府里，没有人能比我干得更好了。”

噢，她多么希望能成为他的妻子，而不是沃尔特的呀！

第十七章


当然，还不能确定沃尔特已经知道了事情的真相，如果他还蒙在鼓里，也许最好让事情顺其自然，但如果他发现了二人的秘密，那么最终这种关系对他们三个人来说可能是块试金石。起初，虽然不能心满意足，但至少她能指望偶尔与查理幽会，但随着时间的推移，她的热情也被激发了出来，近一段时间以来，她开始对阻挡他们永远厮守在一起的种种障碍变得越来越不耐烦了。他已经跟她讲过多次，他也讨厌自己的身份地位，让他不能不小心行事，联结他们之间爱情的纽带本来是那么的美妙，他说，如果他们都是自由身该有多好！她明白他的想法，没人想闹出丑闻，况且人们在彻底改变原有的生活前要三思而行，但如果他们真的获得自由，啊，到那个时候，一切问题都将迎刃而解！

好像也并非每个人都会那么痛苦，她很清楚他和他妻子之间的关系。他的妻子是个冷漠的女人，他们之间已经有多年没有爱情可言了，维系他们夫妻关系的只有搭伙过日子的习惯和传统，当然了，还有孩子。她自己这边比查理那边要麻烦得多，因为沃尔特爱她，但话说回来，他可以把精力投入到工作中，而且一个男人可以去俱乐部打发时光。在一开始，他可能会难过，但很快就会从打击中恢复过来，他也完全可以再娶。查理跟她说过，他怎么也搞不明白她竟然会把自己的一生托付给沃尔特·费恩。

她自己也奇怪，就在刚才，她一想到沃尔特会当场捉到他们还感到害怕呢，这会儿脸上竟然露出了微笑。当然，看到门把手在慢慢转动确实会吓人一跳，但是毕竟他们知道沃尔特能做出的最糟糕的举动也不过如此，而且他们也做好了准备。查理会和她一样如释重负，因为他们在世界上最希望出现的事，莫过于该来的就来吧，好让心头的巨石落地。

沃尔特是个绅士——她凭良心确实应该承认这一点——而且还很爱她，他会做出正确的选择，允许她跟他离婚的。他们已经犯了错，值得庆幸的是，在事情无法收场之前，他们都发现了这个错误。她已经暗下决心将要向他坦白些什么，她怎样对待他的反应。她将会心平气和、面带微笑、坚定不移地面对一切。他们没有必要争吵，从此以后，他们还能高兴地见面，她真心希望他们一起度过的两年时光会成为他宝贵的回忆。

“我觉得多萝西·汤森一点儿也不会介意和查理离婚的。”她思忖，“她最小的儿子将被送回英国，对她来说，和儿子一起待在英国会好得多。在香港她完全无所事事，而在英国她能和孩子们度过所有的假期，然后还可以把父母也接来和他们一起住。”

如果是这样的话，事情会变得很简单。不会闹出什么丑闻或者让她们彼此仇视，一切都会很妥当。然后，她会顺理成章地嫁给查理。凯蒂长长地叹了一口气，他们二人婚后一定会很幸福，所以，为了达到这一目的，克服重重障碍也是值得的。在迷迷糊糊中，各种画面纷至沓来，她想到了他们将在一起生活的场景，想到了他们拥有的快乐，想到了他们会一起出门旅行，还想到了他们居住的房屋的布置。他可能会步步高升，她也可能成为他事业上的贤内助，他会为她感到骄傲，而她自己，也是那么爱慕和崇拜他。

但是，伴随着这些白日梦，凯蒂的心头还是涌起了一阵阵的恐惧。这显得很滑稽，好像是交响乐队的管乐和弦乐在演奏着田园牧歌的曲调，而低音吉他和各种鼔的演奏虽然听上去声音轻柔，却在不断地、预示性地敲击着可怕的恶兆。迟早沃尔特会回到家中，而一想到要面对他，她的心快要跳到嗓子眼了。那天下午他出门时竟然没有跟她说一个字，这一点很奇怪。当然，她并不害怕他，他无论如何不会做出什么出格的事儿来的，她反复地安慰自己。但是，不知为什么，她就是不能放下心头的不安。她在心底把要对他说的话又重复了一遍，大吵大闹似乎于事无补，她真的觉得很抱歉，上天知道她其实不想让他痛苦，但她不爱他，这点她是无能为力的，继续假装下去，对他并没什么好处，告诉他真相总比永远瞒着他要好。她希望他不会太难过，可是他们已经犯下了错误，唯一明智的选择就是承认这一点，她会总想着他的好的。

然而，她这样自言自语时，突如其来的一阵恐惧还是让她的手掌心开始冒汗。因为她还是害怕，她开始对他越想越有气。如果他想吵架，那他自己也要小心点儿。如果他得寸进尺，就不要惊讶她会反击。她会告诉他，她从来没有在乎过他，自从他们结婚以来，没有一天她不是在后悔中度过的。他是那么的乏味无趣，噢，他让她烦得要死，要死，要死！他自己觉得比别人强得多，这真可笑。他没有幽默感，她恨透了他的傲慢、他的冷漠、他的自制。如果除了自己，他对身边的人和事都不感兴趣的话，自制是轻而易举的。对她来说，他是面目可憎的，她讨厌他吻她。他凭什么那么自负？他的舞跳得很烂，在聚会上他是一个扫兴的人。他不会乐器，也不会唱歌，他不会打马球，网球打得也不比别人好。他很会打桥牌？谁会在乎别人桥牌打得有多好？

凯蒂越想越激动，他有胆子就来责怪她吧。所发生的一切都是他自己的错。谢天谢地他终于知道了真相。她恨他，希望永远不要再见到他。没错，她庆幸一切都结束了。为什么他不能让她消停会儿？他已经缠着她多时而且娶了她，现在她已经受够了。

“受够了。”她大声重复着，颤抖的声音中夹杂着愤怒。“受够了，真是受够了！”

就在这时，她听到了小汽车停在了花园入口的声音。随后，是他上楼的脚步声。





第十八章


他走进了房间。她的心怦怦直跳，手也不知不觉地在颤抖。庆幸的是，她正斜靠在沙发上，手上拿着一本摊开的书，好像她在他回来之前一直在看书。他在门口站了片刻，两人的目光相遇了。她的心又沉了下去，突然觉得一股寒意穿过了四肢。她打了个寒战，感觉到了俗话说的那种有人在坟头走过的感觉。他的脸色像死人一样惨白，她曾经见过一次，就是他们一起坐在公园里，他向她求婚的那次。他乌黑的眼珠目不转睛而且深不可测，好像异乎寻常地睁大了看着她。他已经知道了一切。

“你今天回来早了。”她打破了沉默。

她的嘴唇颤抖着，几乎都听不清自己在说些什么。她很害怕，担心自己会晕过去。

“我觉得回来的时间跟往常没什么不同。”

对她来说，他的声音听上去挺奇怪。他在说最后一个字时，声调高了上去，好像让他的话有种随便的口吻，但是显得很生硬，像是故意的。她想知道，如果他看到了她浑身在颤抖会怎样。她努力克制着不让自己喊叫出来。他垂下眼帘。

“我去换身衣服。”

他离开了房间，她快崩溃了，有那么两三分钟她都动不了身子。但终于，她还是很困难地从沙发上站了起来，好像大病初愈，仍然很虚弱。她挪动了一下脚步，不知道她的腿能否支撑住自己。她摸着桌椅向阳台方向走去，然后用一只手扶着墙进了自己的卧室。她穿上了一件在家里穿的长裙，然后又回到了她的化妆间（他们只是在举行聚会时才使用客厅）。他正站在一张餐桌前，翻看着《摘要报》，她硬着头皮走进了房间。

“我们下楼吧，晚餐已经准备好了。”

“我让你久等了吗？”

真是要命，她无法控制住声音的颤抖。

什么时候他会把窗户纸捅破？

他们坐下来，有一阵子两人相对无语。然后他开口打破了沉默，因为他所说的是无聊琐事，反而有种不祥的气氛。

“‘女皇号’今天没有回来。”他说道，“我想船可能被暴风雨给耽搁了。”

“它本来是应该今天进港的吗？”

“是的。”

她现在才看了他一眼，注意到他的眼睛正盯着面前的盘子。他又开始聊另一件事，同样也无关紧要，一场网球锦标赛马上就要开始了，而且他一股脑儿说了半天。通常，他说话的声音带着不同的口吻，让人感到很舒服，而现在他的声音好像只有一个调儿，干巴巴的，显得怪怪的，不自然。这让凯蒂感觉到他说话正在兜圈子，而且他的眼睛一直盯着盘子，或者桌子，或者墙上的画，回避着她的目光，她意识到他不想多看她一眼。

“我们可以上楼去吗？”当晚饭吃完的时候，他说道。

“如果你想上楼，可以。”

她站起身来，他为她打开了门。当她从他身边走过的时候，他的目光落在了她身上。他们到了客厅，他再一次拿起了报纸。

“这是新一期的《摘要报》吗？我觉得我以前没看过。”

“我不知道，我也没注意。”

这份报纸在那儿大约有两周的时间了，她知道他已经看过它好几遍了。他拿着它坐了下来，她靠在沙发上也拿起了书。在平常的晚上，当他们单独待在一起的时候，一般情况下，他们会玩一阵碰对牌游戏或者单人纸牌游戏。而此时，他用一种舒服的姿势斜坐在一把扶手椅上，他的注意力似乎被手上的图片所吸引，半天没有翻动一页报纸。她也想努力地把书读进去，但是眼前的字她根本读不进去，这些印刷的字都是模糊的。她的头开始痛得厉害。

他到底什么时候开口呀？

他们静静地坐了大约有一个小时，她放弃了阅读的努力，让她的小说摊在膝盖上，眼睛茫然地看着眼前的空气。她害怕做出最微小的动作或者发出最微弱的声音。他也一动不动地坐着，带着同样放松的神态，但是用大大的、呆滞的眼睛盯着图片。他的纹丝不动带给人的是一种奇怪的威胁，让凯蒂感到一头猛兽要准备向前一扑。

突然他站了起来，着实吓了她一跳。她握紧了拳头，觉得自己的脸色又变白了。这个时刻来了！

“我还有些工作要做。”他用一种安静、毫无感情的声音说道，眼睛看着别处，“如果你不介意的话，我要去我的书房了。我敢说在我完成工作的时候，你已经上床睡了。”

“我今晚很累。”

“那好吧，晚安。”

“晚安。”

他离开了房间。





第十九章


第二天上午，她在查理一上班时就往他办公室打了一个电话。

“嗯，怎么了？”

“我想见你。”

“亲爱的，我真的忙死了，我有很多工作要做。”

“事情很紧急，我能去你办公室吗？”

“哦，不行，我要是你，我就不会这样做。”

“那好吧，那你来我这儿。”

“我不可能走得开，今天下午怎么样？如果我不去你们家是不是更好点儿？”

“我必须马上见到你。”

电话里出现了一阵停顿，她怕对方挂掉她的电话。

“你还在听吗？”她焦急地问道。

“我在听，我在考虑，究竟发生什么事了？”

“我不能在电话里跟你说。”

在他再次开口前又是一阵沉默。

“好吧，你瞧，我会设法在一点钟时抽出十分钟见你，如果能行的话。你最好去那家名叫库周的店铺，我也会尽早赶过去的。”

“你是说那家古董店？”她有点儿惊愕地问道。

“是呀，我们总不能在香港酒店的大堂里见面吧。”他回答道。

她注意到他的声音里透着懊恼和不耐烦。

“好吧，我会去库周店的。”





第二十章


她在维多利亚路就下了黄包车，沿着陡峭、狭窄的小巷向坡上走去，直到来到了古董店的门前。她在店外逡巡了一会儿，好像被橱窗内展示的小古玩摆件所吸引。但站在门口招呼顾客的一位伙计很快就认出了她，毫不吝啬地给了她一个灿烂的笑容。他用中文冲着店里说了些什么，店主马上迎了出来，他是个个头矮小、长着一张肥嘟嘟的脸、穿着黑色马褂的男人。她快速走进了店里。

“汤森先生还没到，您楼上请，可以吗？”

她走到了店铺的后面，爬上了摇摇晃晃的漆黑楼梯。中国店主跟着她，然后锁上了通向卧室的门。里面空气污浊，还有股刺鼻的鸦片烟的味道。她在一个檀香木的箱子上坐了下来。

不一会儿工夫，她听到从吱呀作响的楼梯上传来一阵沉重的脚步声。查理进来了，随手关上了身后的房门。他阴沉着脸，但当看见她时，他脸上的阴霾马上消失了。他用他那独有的迷人方式微笑了起来，很快把她揽入怀中，开始亲吻她的双唇。

“现在告诉我，你遇到什么麻烦了？”

“只有见到你，才会让我觉得好受些。”她的脸上也露出了笑容。

他坐到了床边，点上了一支香烟。

“今天上午你听上去好像心力交瘁。”

“我也不知道为什么。”她回答道，“我觉得我一晚上都没合眼。”

他看了她一眼，微笑虽然还挂在脸上，但笑容有点儿僵硬和不自然。她也看出他的眼里闪烁着焦虑。

“他发现了。”她说道。

在他回答之前，又有一阵子的沉默。

“他说了什么吗？”

“他什么也没说。”

“什么！”他恶狠狠地看着她，“那你凭什么说他发现了？”

“一切迹象都表明他发现了我们俩的事儿，他的表情，他在晚餐时说话的口气。”

“他跟你找碴儿吗？”

“不，恰恰相反，他处处显得彬彬有礼，自从我们结婚以来，他头一回没有吻我、跟我道晚安。”

她垂下眼帘，无法确定查理是否能够理解她所说的话。通常情况下，沃尔特会紧紧地抱着她，把他的双唇压在她的唇上，久久不放开，这时他的整个身体由于亲吻变得温柔和充满激情。

“那你觉得为什么他什么都不说？”

“我不知道。”

两人又沉默了片刻。凯蒂直愣愣地坐在檀香木箱子上，充满焦虑地看着查理。他的脸色再一次变得阴沉下来，眉头紧皱，嘴角向下耷拉着。但是，不一会儿，他又目视上方，恶作剧般的目光在闪烁。

“我真想知道他会说些什么。”

她没有答话，不知道他什么意思。

“不管怎么说，他不会是第一个对这种事睁一只眼闭一只眼的男人。大吵一架对他有什么好处呢？如果他想闹，当初就一定会坚持要进你的房间。”他眨着双眼，咧嘴又笑了起来，“那样就会有一对该死的傻瓜让人笑话了。”

“我真希望你能见到他昨天晚上的脸色。”

“我料到他很难受，不用说，这是一种打击，对任何一个男人来说，这都把他置于了屈辱的境地。沃尔特总是那么傻里傻气的，他给我的印象好像一个大老爷们儿整天婆婆妈妈地惦记着当众去洗家里的床单、桌布什么的。”

“我不这么看。”她若有所思地回答道，“他很敏感，我已经发现了这一点。”

“就我们目前的情况来看，还算不错。你知道，要防患于未然，一个好的策略就是换位思考，如果你处在他的位置上，你会采取什么行动。一个男人想保留颜面的唯一方式就是假装什么都不知道，我敢保证他肯定会这么干。”

查理说得越多，就越变得亢奋起来。他的蓝眼睛闪着光，又恢复了他的活泼与快乐，散发着鼓舞士气的信心。

“上天作证，我不想说他的坏话，但是说正经的，你要屈尊对一个细菌学家下一个结论的话，他也没什么了不起的。如果西蒙斯先生退休回国，我很可能成为殖民地大臣，如果沃尔特不想受到什么损失的话，他就得站到我这一边，他要想保住赖以谋生的工作，就像我们所有人那样，说话办事就得好好掂量掂量了。你觉得殖民地当局会怎么对待一个整天惹是生非、制造丑闻的家伙？相信我，如果他闭嘴的话，他会得到想要的一切，如果他不长脑子大吵大闹的话，没有好果子吃。”

凯蒂不安地挪动了一下身子。她知道沃尔特很害羞，能够想象得到，他害怕出现吵架的场景，对引起公众注意的事情更是千方百计要躲避，这些情况都会影响到他。但是，她认为他不会受物质上小恩小惠的摆布，也许她确实对他还了解不深，但查理真的完全不明白他的为人。

“你可曾想过他疯狂地爱着我？”

他没有回答，但他眼睛里透着顽皮的神情，冲她微微笑着。她明白自己就是对他这种迷人的神色不能自拔。

“好吧，你直说吧！我知道你会说不中听的话。”

“嗯，你知道，女人们通常会自以为男人们会很疯狂地爱着她们，而实际上并非如此。”

她第一次笑了起来，他的自信感染了她。

“你真是危言耸听呢。”

“你也同样如此，最近你丈夫没有怎么来烦你吧，也许他不像以前那么爱你了。”

“在任何情况下，我也不会自欺欺人地认为你疯狂地爱着我。”她反击道。

“那你就大错特错了。”

啊，听到他那么说多美好呀！她明白这一点，她信任他对她的爱，这份爱融化了她的心。他边说边从床沿站起身来，走过来和她并肩坐在了檀香木箱子上，他伸出一只手臂揽过了她的腰身。

“你这个小傻瓜不要再为这事继续担惊受怕了。”他说道，“我向你保证没什么可害怕的。就凭我多年的经验判断，他肯定装作什么事也没发生一样。你知道，这种事往往死无对证。你说他爱你，也许正说明他不想失去你。我敢发誓，除了让你嫁给我外，他会接受任何事的。”

她斜靠着他，身体无力地紧紧贴着他的手臂。她对他的爱几乎是一种折磨。他最后几句话触动了她：也许沃尔特爱她很深，如果她能时不时地允许这份爱持续下去，他会忍气吞声的。她能理解这种感受，因为她对查理的爱就是这样的。一种骄傲之感涌上心头，与此同时，还夹杂着对男人隐隐约约的蔑视：一个男人怎么能爱得这样低三下四。

她充满爱意地用双手搂着查理的脖子。

“你真是太棒了，当我来这儿之前，完全不知所措，如同风中摇摆的叶子，听你这么一说，一切都万事大吉了。”

他用双手捧着她的脸，开始亲吻她的双唇。

“亲爱的宝贝。”

“你真是我的依靠和安慰呀。”她叹了口气。

“我向你保证你没必要紧张。而且你知道我始终站在你身边，我不会让你倒下的。”

她赶走了心中的恐惧，但瞬间心中有点儿感性地后悔她对未来的计划也全落空了。既然所有的危险已经过去，她差点儿希望沃尔特要是打算坚持和她离婚就好了。

“我就知道我能指望你。”她说道。

“我本来就希望如此。”

“你本来就该回去啦，到了午餐的时间了。”

“哦，该死的午餐。”

他把她一把搂过来，现在她已经紧紧地在他怀抱里了，他的嘴在寻找她的双唇。

“哦，查理，你得让我走了。”

“休想。”

她轻轻笑了一声，这是充满胜利感和幸福感的笑声。他的眸子里闪烁着强烈的欲望，他把她抱了起来，不让她离开，让她紧紧地贴着自己的胸膛，然后锁上了门。





第二十一章


整个下午她的脑海里都想着查理所说的关于沃尔特的那些话。当天晚上他们计划外出吃饭，他从俱乐部回来的时候，她正在梳妆打扮。他敲了敲她的屋门。

“进来。”

他并没有推门进来。

“我就直接去换衣服了，你还要多长时间？”

“十分钟。”

他没有再说什么，返身回了自己的房间。他好像故意控制着语气，就像昨天晚上那样。她现在已经镇定自若了，在他捅破这层窗户纸之前，她已经做好了准备。当他走下楼时，她已经在车里落座了。

“让你久等了。”他说道。

“还好。”她回答道，当她说这话的时候竟然还露出了笑容。

当车子向山下开的时候，她还不时说上一两句话，但他的回答都是冷冰冰的。她耸了耸肩，也开始变得有点儿不耐烦了，如果他想生闷气，随他去，她才不在乎呢。一路上他们不再说话，一直到达了目的地。这是一场规模很大的晚宴，有太多的人光顾，当然也有太多的菜肴可以品尝。凯蒂一边快乐地和她的邻座聊着天，一边偷偷地瞄了一眼沃尔特。他的脸色惨白，眉头也没有舒展。

“你丈夫看上去很疲惫，我想他不是嫌这里太热吧。他工作的压力是不是太大了？”

“他工作起来总是很玩命。”

“我想你们是不是很快就要离开这儿了？”

“哦，是的，我想我们要去日本了，就像去年那样。”她说道，“如果我不想把小命交代到这儿的话，医生们说我必须逃离这种闷热。”

沃尔特没有像往常他们外出赴宴那样，用他含笑的目光时不时地扫上她几眼。他一眼也没看她，她已经注意到了这点。当他们走出来去坐车时，他的眼睛在刻意回避她，他也没有像通常那样彬彬有礼，让她把手搭在他的手上一起走。当和身旁的女士们说话的时候，他也没有丝毫笑容，只是用坚定而一眨也不眨的眼睛看着她们。他的双眼的确很大，在苍白的脸上显得像煤炭一样黑。他板着一副严肃的面孔。

“他可真是一个随和的好伴侣。”凯蒂不无讽刺地心里嘀咕着。

一想到那些不幸的女士在试图和那位带着一副冰冷面具的人聊天，凯蒂就觉得好笑。

当然，他也清楚，毫无疑问，她让他怒不可遏，可为什么他不说出来？难道果真是因为他太爱她了，即使生气和伤心，但还是害怕她会离开他吗？这个念头让她有点儿瞧不起他，可他的脾气还算温厚，毕竟，他是她的丈夫，是他为她提供了生活保障。只要他不干涉她的事，让她能够随心所欲地做事，她还是会善待他的。从另一方面来看，或许他的沉默是一种病态的怯懦，查理是对的，他说没有谁比沃尔特更不愿招惹上闲话的了。如果不到万不得已，他不会吭声的。有一次他曾告诉她一件事，他曾经作为一个案子的证人被传唤出庭作证，在法庭上他需要提供专业性的证据，在此之前，他有一周的时间都没睡好觉，他的害羞简直就是一种病态。

可能还有另外一层原因，男人们都很虚荣，只要没人知道事情的真相，沃尔特会甘愿不去理会它。那么她很想搞明白查理的分析是不是正确，查理暗示说沃尔特知道是谁给他提供了这份工作，他心里清楚应该怎么做。查理是在香港地头上最受欢迎的人，很快就会当上殖民地大臣，他对沃尔特来说很有用。再者说了，如果沃尔特不识好歹，查理也不会给他什么好果子吃的。当她想到自己情人的权势和决心时，心中一阵狂喜。在他刚健有力的双臂中，她觉得是那么放松。男人真是一种奇怪的动物，以前她从来没有想过沃尔特能够这样卑鄙，这是她做梦也想不到的。也许他严肃的外表只不过是张面具，掩盖着他卑鄙和欺骗的天性。她越想到这一点，越觉得查理很可能是对的。她把目光再次落到她丈夫身上，发现他根本没有跟人聊天。

当他周围的女客们和她们的邻座交谈的时候，他就落了单。他的眼睛直勾勾地盯着前面，好像忘了这场聚会，眼睛里充满了致命的忧伤，这让凯蒂像受到了电击般一震。





第二十二章


第二天，午饭后她正躺着小憩的时候，突然被一阵敲门声惊醒，她赶忙坐起身来。

“是谁呀？”她有点儿生气地喊道。

在每天的这个时间，她不习惯被人打扰。

“是我。”

她听出是丈夫的声音，赶紧坐了起来。

“进来。”

“我把你吵醒了吗？”他边进门边问道。

“事实上，你的确把我吵醒了。”她用一种看上去很自然的口吻回答道，在过去的两天里，她就是用这种口吻跟他讲话的。

“你能来一下隔壁的房间吗？我有话跟你说。”

她的心一下子又跳到了嗓子眼。

“我披上睡袍就来。”

他走开了，她把光着的脚伸到拖鞋里，把自己裹到了长袍里，抽空冲镜子看了一下自己，看到自己脸色苍白，于是往脸上擦了点儿胭脂。她在隔壁的门前站了一会儿，平息了一下要和沃尔特摊牌的紧张心情，然后带着一种义无反顾的神情走进了房间。

“你今天怎么能在这个时候从实验室里抽开身？”她说道，“我平时在这个点儿看不到你回来。”

“你为什么不坐下来？”

他没有看她，说话的语气很严肃。她很高兴他提出了这个要求，因为她发觉自己的双腿有点儿抖，无法再用开玩笑的口吻继续说下去了，所以只能保持沉默。他也坐了下来，点着了一支香烟，眼睛不安地向房间里四下望着，似乎很难开口。

突然他的目光落到了她的身上，因为他的眼睛原本一直在努力回避她，所以这样紧盯着她着实吓了她一跳。她使劲忍住了才没喊叫。

“你听说过湄潭府这个地方吗？”他问道，“最近报纸上登了很多关于这个地方的事儿。”

她惊讶地望着他，犹犹豫豫地说道：

“是发生霍乱的那个地方吗？阿布斯诺特先生昨天晚上谈起过它。”

“这种病正在快速传播，我认为这种已经流行多年的疾病现在达到爆发的高峰期了。那儿原来有一名医疗传教士，但他三天前死于霍乱，那儿还有几个法国修女，当然还有一个海关的人，其他的人都被疏散出去了。”

他的眼睛仍然盯着她，她也不能回避，只好试图解读出他话中的含义。但是她还是紧张，只能辨别出他的话语里有一种奇怪的专注与认真。他怎么能如此目光坚定，眼睛甚至眨都不眨？

“法国的修女们在竭尽所能地帮助病人，她们把失去父母的孤儿转到医院里，但是人们还是成片地死去。我自己要求去疫区并作为负责人承担起责任。”

“你？”

她被吓了一跳。她的第一反应是如果他去了，她就自由了，可以没有任何束缚和障碍地与查理约会了。但是这个想法让她吃了一惊，她觉得自己的脸红了。他为什么用那样的目光看着她？她尴尬地扭过头去。

“有必要那样做吗？”她支支吾吾地说道。

“那个地方现在没有一个外国医生。”

“但你不是医生，你是个细菌学家。”

“我是个医学博士，你知道，在我从事细菌研究之前，我在一家医院里做了很多全科医生的工作。而事实上，我首先还是一位细菌学家，这个身份对于应对这场瘟疫大有好处，而且这对于我的研究工作也是一个难得的机会。”

他几乎是用一种漫不经心的方式说出这番话的，但她偷偷地瞥了他一眼，吃惊地发现他的眼中有一种嘲弄的神色，让她无法理解。

“但是这会不会真的很危险？”

“确实很危险。”

他微笑着，那是嘲弄的而又痛苦的表情。她把前额靠在手臂上。那简直就是自杀，可怕的自寻死路，她从没想到他会使出这样一招。她不能让他这样做，这太残酷了。如果她不爱他，也不是她的错啊。她无法忍受他因为她而去自杀，泪水无声地滑下了面颊。

“你哭什么？”

他的声音冷冰冰的。

“你没有义务一定要去，是吧？”

“没有，但我心甘情愿去。”

“请不要去，沃尔特。如果你出了什么事，那真是太可怕了。你要是死了怎么办？”

虽然他依旧面无表情，但是眼睛里再次透出一丝笑意。他没有作答。

“这个地方在哪儿？”一阵沉默之后，她开口问道。

“湄潭府？它在西江的一条支流旁边，我们到那儿得沿江坐船到上游，然后再坐轿过去。”

“我们是谁？”

“你和我。”

她快速地看了他一眼，以为自己听错了。但是他眼中的微笑现在已经转移到了嘴角，他的黑眼珠一动不动地盯着她。

“你希望我也跟你一起去吗？”

“我觉得你会愿意跟我一道去的。”

她的呼吸变得急促起来，一股寒意传遍了全身。

“但是那儿肯定是不适合女人去的。那个传教士把他的妻子和孩子几周前都送了回来，还有去送阿司匹林的人和他的妻子也刚回到香港。我在一个茶会上遇见了她，我刚想起来她说他们因为霍乱离开了某个地方。”

“还有五个法国修女在那儿呢。”

恐慌占据了她的心。

“我不明白你的意思，我要去可是个疯狂的举动。你知道我是多么的柔弱。赫华德医生说我必须离开香港，因为我受不了这里的炎热，我更受不了那儿的潮热呀，何况还有霍乱，听一耳朵我都会吓得魂飞魄散。去那地方就是自讨苦吃，我没有理由去那个地方，我会死的。”

他没有回答，她绝望地望着他，几乎控制不住要大声喊叫了。他的脸色死灰中挂着苍白，突然让她觉得惊恐万分，从他的脸上她看出了憎恶的表情。有没有可能他就是想让她去死？她不顾一切地喊出了自己的想法。

“这太荒唐了，如果你认为你应该去，那是你自己的决定，但你绝不要指望我也去。我讨厌疾病，更别说传染很快的霍乱了，我不会假装自己有多勇敢，我也不介意告诉你我没有勇气到那种地方去，我要待在这儿直到我该去日本的时候。”

“我原以为当我马上出发要奔赴一个危险的地方的时候，你会想着要陪伴在我身边呢。”

他现在正在公开地嘲笑她，她也有点儿困惑，不知道他真的要像他说的那样去做，还是仅仅吓唬她一下。

“我觉得任何人都会理解我拒绝身赴险境的决定，本来我去那个地方也——也起不到什么作用。”

“你能起的作用可大了，你能让我开心和舒服。”

她的脸色变得更白了。

“我不明白你在说些什么。”

“我看要搞明白我的话不需要什么特别的智力吧。”

“我不会去的，沃尔特，你这样强求我也太过分了。”

“那么我也不去了，我马上收回我的申请。”





第二十三章


她茫然地看着他，他所说的一切在一开始是那么出乎意料，她几乎都没明白是怎么回事儿。

“你究竟在说什么？”她用颤抖的声音说道。

甚至在她自己听起来这声音都不正常，她看到沃尔特板着的脸上露出了轻蔑的神情。

“恐怕你把我当成了彻头彻尾的大傻瓜了。”

她不知道该说什么好，迟疑着是否应该义愤填膺地为自己的清白辩解，还是用一串怒火中烧的斥责来回击。他似乎看出了她的想法。

“我已经得到了全部必要的证据。”

她开始哭了，泪水汩汩而出，但没有任何特别的痛苦，她并没有打算擦干它们。哭泣能给她腾出点儿时间整理一下思路，可是她的大脑还是一片空白。他冷漠地观察着她，他的这种冷静让她感到害怕。后来，他变得不耐烦了。

“现在哭还有用吗？你心里很清楚。”

他的声音是那么的冰冷和无情，反而激起了她的某种愤慨之情。她定了定神。

“我不在乎，我想你不会反对我和你离婚吧，这对一个男人来说算不上什么事儿。”

“恕我冒昧地问一句，凭什么由于你的缘故，我要让自己陷入哪怕是最微不足道的麻烦中呢？”

“这对你丝毫没有影响呀，只不过让你做得像个绅士。”

“我已经够绅士的啦，还要考虑到你以后的生活。”

现在她坐直了身子，擦干了眼泪。

“你什么意思？”她质问他道。

“除非汤森受到指控和你通奸，这样他才能和你结婚。这案子太丢人了，他妻子不得不和他离婚。”

“你不知道你在胡说些什么吧。”她喊了出来。

“你个蠢货。”

他的口吻非常轻蔑，她的脸因为愤怒涨得通红。因为她以前从没听到过他这样对她讲话，她听到的总是甜言蜜语、赞美奉承以及轻松愉快的事情，所以听到这话她更加愤怒。她已经习惯了他对于她每次的异想天开都百依百顺。

“如果你想要知道真相我就统统告诉你。他急不可耐地想娶我，多萝西·汤森也非常愿意和他离婚，只要我们一获得自由就马上结婚。”

“这些话是他告诉你的吗，还是你从他的行为中获得的感想？”

沃尔特的目光中闪烁着辛辣的挖苦，使得凯蒂有些不自在。她确实不太肯定查理是否真的说过这些话了。

“他一遍又一遍地这样说了。”

“那是谎言，而且你也知道这不过是骗你玩儿的。”

“他全心全意地爱着我。他爱我就像我爱他一样充满着激情。既然你已经发现了，我也就不想否认任何事了。我为什么要隐瞒？我们是情人关系已经一年了，我为此感到自豪。在这个世界上，对我来说他意味着一切，我很高兴你终于知道了这一点。我们已经厌倦偷偷摸摸、提心吊胆的生活了。嫁给你是我犯的一个错误，当初真不应该这样做，我是个傻瓜，我一点儿也不爱你，我们俩没有丝毫的共同点，我不喜欢你欣赏的人，我讨厌你感兴趣的那些事儿。谢天谢地，这种日子终于结束了。”

他纹丝不动地看着她，脸上没有任何表情。他听得很专注，但神情并没有什么变化，表明她的话并没有对他产生丝毫影响。

“你知道我为什么会嫁给你吗？”

“因为你想在你妹妹多瑞丝前面把自己嫁出去。”

这倒是真的，但多少让她觉得具有讽刺意味，她吃了一惊——他竟然了然于胸。说也奇怪，就在恐惧和愤怒的这一刻，她的心中产生一丝怜悯。这时，他也淡淡地一笑。

“我对你没抱什么幻想。”他说道，“我知道你愚蠢、轻浮、没头脑，但是我爱你；我知道你的目标和理想既粗俗又平庸，但是我爱你；我知道你是个二流货色，但是我爱你。想想都可笑，你开心的时候，我还得千方百计装作和你一样开心。我曾因得在你面前表现出我是一个愚昧、粗俗和爱传流言蜚语的蠢人而焦虑。我知道智慧会让你大惊失色，所以我竭尽全力让你觉得我和你所交往的男人们一样是个大傻瓜。我知道你嫁给我就是为了图省事，我是那么爱你，所以我不在乎。我所见到过的大多数人，当他们爱上某个人的时候，如果他们的爱没有得到回报，他们就会觉得委屈，就会变得愤怒和怨天尤人。我不像他们，我绝不指望你能爱上我，我找不出任何理由你应该爱我，也从没想过我自己有多值得爱。我心存感激，因为上苍允许我爱你，有时当我想到你和我在一起时，心中充满快乐，因为我注意到了在你眼中有一抹快活的神色，这种念头会让我欣喜若狂。我努力不让你对我的爱感到厌烦，如果你厌了、烦了，我知道我会受不了的。我总是小心翼翼地留神你对我的感情有不耐烦的蛛丝马迹，有些事情，大多数丈夫认为是自己的权利，而我会把它当成一种恩惠。”

凯蒂，早已习惯养尊处优，人人都呵护奉承她，她以前从没听到有人对她说过这样的话。于是，无名的怒火从她心中升起，驱散了恐惧，她似乎觉得胸口被什么东西堵住了，太阳穴的血管突突直跳。虚荣心受到伤害使一个女人产生的报复心甚至比一只幼崽被抢走的母狮子还要重。凯蒂的下巴，平时总显得太过四四方方，可这时像猿猴一样凸出，显得很丑陋，她漂亮的双眸闪烁着怨恨的黑色火焰，但是她最终控制住了自己的脾气。

“如果一个男人不能让一个女人爱他，那是那个男人的错，而不是那个女人的错。”

“完全正确。”

他嘲弄的口吻增加了她的恼怒，她觉得如果自己能保持冷静，就能够伤害到他。

“我受教育不多而且也不是很聪明，我只是一个非常普通的年轻女人，我喜欢的东西和我生活圈子里的人喜欢的东西一模一样，我喜欢跳舞、网球和戏剧，也喜欢运动型的男人。实话实说，我觉得你很乏味，对你喜欢的东西也不感兴趣，所有的这些我全都厌烦，全都不想要。你拽着我没完没了地逛威尼斯那些毫无趣味的美术馆，可我更喜欢去桑维治打高尔夫球。”

“我知道。”

“如果我没能成为你理想中的妻子我很抱歉，更不幸的是，我总是对你在身体上有种排斥，但你不能因为这一点而责怪我。”

“我没有怪你。”

假设他暴跳如雷，凯蒂可能还更容易应付这种局面。她本来能以暴制暴，还以颜色的。他的自控力简直是非人性的。虽然她以前从来没有恨过他，但现在她开始恨他了。

“我觉得你简直就不是个男人。为什么当你知道我和查理在屋里的时候你不闯进来？至少你应该想着要痛打他一顿呀。你害怕了？”

但是，说这话的一刻她的脸红了，因为她感到了羞愧。他没有说话，但是在他的眼中她读出了冰冷的鄙视，他的嘴角闪着一丝不易察觉的冷笑。

“本来应该那样，就像历史上的人物决斗一样，但我不屑于打架。”

凯蒂实在想不出用什么话来回击他了，耸了耸肩。他盯着她好一会儿。

“我认为我已经说完了要说的话，如果你拒绝去湄潭府，我就撤回申请。”

“为什么你不同意跟我离婚？”

最后他把目光从她身上移开了，靠在椅子上点着了一支香烟，直到把烟抽完也没再说一句话。然后，他扔掉了烟蒂，淡淡地一笑，再一次看着她。

“如果汤森太太向我承诺会跟她丈夫离婚，而他同样向我做出书面承诺要娶你，在一周之内两份协议生效，我就同意跟你离婚。”

他说话的方式中有某种东西让她不安，但是她的自尊迫使她只能接受他的条件，而且是以一种大义凛然的态度。

“你真是慷慨大度极了，沃尔特。”

让她大吃一惊的是，他突然爆发出一阵大笑，她愤怒的脸又涨得通红。

“你在笑什么？我看不出有什么可笑的。”

“请你原谅，我只能说我的幽默感与众不同。”

她皱着眉看着他，想说些刺耳和伤人的话，但是一时又想不起。他看了看手表。

“如果你想在办公室里找到汤森，你最好麻利点儿。如果你决定跟我去湄潭府，后天就得动身了。”

“你想让我今天就告诉他？”

“人们常说时不我待。”

她的心开始跳得快了起来，不是因为不安，到底是因为什么，自己也说不清楚。她原本希望时间能够再拖得长些，好让查理有所准备。但是，她对查理充满信心，他爱她如同她对他的爱一样多——或许他不太愿意接受这强加在他们头上的胁迫，这种念头在她脑海中一闪而过。不，这简直是对他们爱情的亵渎。她很严肃地转过身对着沃尔特说道：

“我认为你不知道爱情是什么，你对我和查理两人之间彼此热烈的爱情完全没有概念，它是我们生命中唯一重要的东西，如果让我们为了爱情做出牺牲，我们会毫不犹豫。”

他向她微微鞠了一躬，但是什么话也没有说，目送着她昂首挺胸走出房间。





第二十四章


她给查理留了个便条，上面写道：“请来见我，事情紧急。”一个中国职员让她等着，然后告诉她汤森先生五分钟后见她。她有着不可名状的紧张焦虑。最后，她被人领进了查理的办公室，他走上前来跟她握了握手，但当职员关上了房门，只留他们俩单独在一起的时候，他马上把和蔼可亲、一本正经的态度抛到了一边。

“我说，亲爱的，你真的有必要在工作时间着急来这儿吗？我有太多的事情要做，而且不想给别人说闲话的机会。”

她用她那双美丽的眼睛端详了他半天，想挤出笑容，但嘴角僵硬，根本笑不出来。

“除非迫不得已，我是不会来这儿的。”

他笑着拉着她的手臂。

“好的，既然你都来了，就坐下吧。”

办公室家具不多，比较狭窄，屋顶较高，墙壁被刷成了褐色，深一道，浅一道。仅有的家具是一张大书桌，一把查理坐的旋转椅和一把为访客准备的皮扶手椅，可凯蒂只要坐进这把椅子就总感觉浑身不自在。查理坐在桌子后面，她以前从没看见过他戴眼镜，他注意到她的目光落在了他的眼镜上，就把它摘了下来。

“我只在读东西时才用眼镜。”他说道。

她的眼泪说流就流了下来，也不知道为什么。她开始哭了起来，本来没有打算装给他看，但她有种本能的冲动想唤起他的同情。他不知所措地望着她。

“出了什么事了吗？噢，我亲爱的，别哭。”

她掏出手绢，想抑制住抽泣。他按了按铃，当那个职员走到门前的时候，他把门打开了。

“如果有人找我，就说我不在。”

“好的，先生。”

职员关上了门，查理坐在了椅子背上，用他的手臂搂着凯蒂的肩膀。

“现在，凯蒂宝贝，告诉我怎么回事吧。”

“沃尔特想要离婚。”她说道。

她觉得肩膀上他手臂的力道消失了，他的身体也变得僵直了。片刻沉默之后，查理从椅背上站起身来，又坐回到了自己的靠背椅上。

“究竟是怎么回事？”他说道。

她很快地看了他一眼，觉出他的声音嘶哑了，看到他的脸也沉下来变红了。

“我和他有过一次谈话，谈完话后我直接从家来到这儿。他说他已经掌握了所有的证据。”

“你自己没承认，对吗？你没承认任何事吧？”

她的心沉了下去。

“没有。”她回答道。

“你确定什么都没承认吗？”他问道，目光锐利地看着她。

“我确定。”她又一次说了谎。

他靠回了椅子背，眼睛茫然地看着挂在他面前墙上的中国地图。她焦急地看着他，从他刚刚听到这个消息的表现上，她感到有点儿不太对劲儿，原来指望他能把她搂在怀里，告诉她他心存感激，因为现在他们终于可以永远地在一起了。然而男人们遇到这种情景当然都很滑稽。她轻轻地哭泣着，现在不是为了博得同情，而是因为哭泣似乎是她唯一能做的很自然的事了。

“这下我们可麻烦大了。”沉默许久后，他开口说道，“但是，失去理智于事无补，你知道，哭哭啼啼对我们也没有任何好处。”

她注意到他的声音里有点儿懊恼，于是擦干了眼泪。

“这不是我的错，查理，我控制不住自己，就想哭。”

“你当然控制不住，运气真是糟糕透顶，我跟你一样脱不了干系。我们当下要做的是怎么摆脱这个麻烦，我觉得你比我更不想离婚吧。”

她倒吸了一口气，看着他，想搞清楚他什么意思，而他根本没顾及她的疑惑。

“我想知道他究竟掌握了什么证据。我不知道他能怎样证明就是我们俩待在那间屋子里。总体上，我们一直都尽可能地小心谨慎。我敢保证古董店的那个老家伙不会出卖我们，即使他看见我们出入古董店，也证明不了什么呀，没有理由说我们俩不能一起逛古董店嘛。”

他好像在自说自话，而不是在对她说。

“指控某项罪名很容易，但要找出证据可就太难了，每个律师都会告诉你这一点的。我们的底线就是否认一切，如果他威胁说要采取诉讼，我们就告诉他，下地狱去吧，我们会反击的。”

“我不能上法庭，查理。”

“为什么不能？恐怕你不得不上。上帝作证，我不想和你争吵，但是我们不能坐以待毙。”

“我们为什么要否认它呢？”

“瞧你这问题问的。毕竟这事不但跟你有关系，跟我也有关系。但事实上我认为你大可不必担心。我们能摆平你丈夫的，我现在唯一需要考虑的是如何采用一种最好的方式来着手办这件事。”

这时他好像突然有了主意，因为他又面向她露出了他迷人的微笑，他的口吻刚才还生硬而官腔十足，现在变成奉承讨好的腔调了。

“恐怕你这段时间会非常难受，我可怜的小凯蒂，真是太糟糕了。”他伸出手抓住了她的手，“这只是我们遇到的一个小麻烦，我们一定会搞定的，它不是……”他停住了，凯蒂怀疑他下面想说他不是第一次搞定这样的麻烦事了，“现在最重要的是保持头脑清醒，你知道我是绝不会抛下你的。”

“我不害怕，我不在乎他做什么。”

他还在微笑，但也许他的微笑有点儿勉强。

“如果事情到了不可收拾的地步，我会把这事告诉总督的。他虽然会臭骂我一顿，但他是个好人，而且权力很大，他会把事情平息下去的，闹出丑闻的话，对他也没什么好处。”

“他能做什么？”凯蒂问道。

“他会给沃尔特施加压力，如果他不能利用沃尔特的事业心让他屈服，也会提醒他如果不听话会丢掉饭碗。”

凯蒂有点儿不寒而栗，她似乎还无法使查理明白事情的严重程度，他空洞的想法让她有些不耐烦。她有些后悔来他的办公室见他，周围的环境让她觉得有种无形的威胁。如果她能躺在他的怀抱中，用她的双臂勾着他的脖子，告诉他她究竟想要什么，可能她会感到放松得多。

“你不了解沃尔特。”她说道。

“我知道每个男人都会待价而沽，都会被收买。”

她全心全意地爱着查理，但是他的回答让她不安，这么聪明的男人怎么会说出这样愚蠢的话。

“我觉得你还没明白沃尔特有多愤怒，你没有见到他的脸色和他眼中的神情。”

他停顿了一会儿没有说话，但是带着轻笑看着她。她明白他心里正在想什么。沃尔特是个细菌学家，是他的下级，按理来说是不会做出粗鲁放肆的举动，使自己成为殖民地上层官员们的眼中钉的。

“你这样自欺欺人没有用处，查理。”她着急地说道，“如果沃尔特下定决心采取行动，你或者别的什么人所说的话对他产生不了什么影响。”

他的脸又一次阴沉了下来。

“他的意思是要指控我是奸夫？”

“一开始是这样，但最后我说服了他同意和我离婚。”

“哦，好吧，还不算太糟糕。”他的态度又缓和了下来，她看到了他眼中如释重负的神情，“对我来说，那似乎是个很好的出路。无论如何，那是男人可用的最后一招，也是唯一体面的解决方案。”

“但是他开出了条件。”

他用探寻的目光看了她一眼，似乎在考量着什么。

“当然了，虽说我不是很富有，但我会尽力而为的。”

凯蒂不说话了。查理所说的话是她做梦也没想到的，让她不知说什么好。她本来希望能紧紧抱住他，把发烫的脸藏在他的胸口，一股脑儿地把想说的话都吐露出来。

“如果你妻子承诺跟你离婚，他就会答应跟我离婚。”

“还有别的吗？”

凯蒂几乎自己都听不到自己的声音了。

“还有——呃，很难说出口，查理，听上去很难为情——呃，在离婚协议签署生效一周之内，如果你答应娶我。”





第二十五章


他又沉默了好一会儿，然后，再一次牵起了她的手，并温柔地把自己的手放在了上面。

“你知道，亲爱的。”他说道，“无论发生什么事，我们都不要把多萝西牵扯进来。”

她一脸茫然地望着他。

“但是我不明白，我们怎么能不把她牵扯进来？”

“嗯，在这个世界上，我们不能只考虑我们自己。事情是公平的，在世上没有什么像娶你这样的事让我更愿意做的了，但是会有问题，我了解多萝西，她绝对不会跟我离婚。”

凯蒂完全被吓坏了，她又开始哭了起来。他站起身来，坐到了她身边，用手臂揽着她的腰。

“别再跟自己过不去了，亲爱的，我们必须保持理智。”

“我还以为你是爱我的……”

“我当然爱你。”他轻言细语地说道，“你不用有丝毫的怀疑。”

“如果她不跟你离婚，沃尔特会指控你破坏别人家庭。”

他很长时间没吱声，然后用干巴巴的口吻说道：

“这当然会毁了我的事业，但是我觉得对你也没有什么好处。如果到了迫不得已的时候，我会一五一十地向多萝西坦白的。她肯定会很受伤，而且也会很痛苦，但她终究会原谅我的。”他又有了一个想法，“我不能确定这是不是最佳方案，如果我全都向她坦白，如果她去找你的丈夫谈判的话，我敢说她一定会说服他闭嘴的。”

“那就是说你不想跟她离婚？”

“是的，我得为我的孩子着想呀，不是吗？而且我自然也不想让她难过，我们在一起一直相处得很好，你知道，对我来说，她真是一个特别称职的妻子。”

“那你以前为什么总跟我说她在你眼中什么都不是？”

“我从没这样说过，我确实说过我不爱她。除了偶尔在一起，比如圣诞节，或者她回国之前或者从国内回来。我们分居好多年了，她对夫妻间的事不太感兴趣，但是我们一直相敬如宾，我不介意告诉你我对她的依赖程度超过了任何人的想象。”

“那么你为什么来招惹我呢？”

一阵恐惧袭来让她无法呼吸，但奇怪的是，她竟然能平静地说话。

“你是我多年来所见到的最可爱的女人，我疯狂地爱上了你，你不能为此而责怪我。”

“不管怎么说，你承诺过不会抛下我不管的。”

“但是，上帝呀，我的确不会抛下你不管的，但现在身陷困境，我正打算尽一切力量把你解救出来。”

“除了一件显而易见和再正常不过的事之外。”

他站了起来，又坐回了他自己的椅子上。

“我亲爱的，你必须清醒。我们最好直面目前的状况。我不想伤害你的感情，但我必须告诉你实话，我很在意我的事业，有朝一日我会成为总督，殖民地总督真是一个再轻松不过的职位。除非我们把这事压下去，否则我根本不会有一丝的机会。我可能不得不辞职，但总有一个污点，对我以后的发展不利。如果我被迫离开这个职位，我只能去中国经商，因为在那儿我还有些熟人。但无论是哪种情况，我都会让多萝西留在我身边。”

“那你当初有必要一再跟我说，在这个世界上除了我，你什么都不想要吗？”

他的嘴角又生气地耷拉了下来。

“哦，我亲爱的，当一个男人爱上你的时候，他说的话是当不得真的。”

“你的意思是你说的话也不能当真？”

“当时我可是真心的。”

“如果沃尔特和我离婚了，我怎么办？”

“当然，如果实在无能为力了，我们也就放弃抵抗了。这事不会闹得尽人皆知的，而且现在的人们对这种事都很宽容。”

凯蒂第一次想到了自己的母亲，她浑身颤抖着，又看了看查理，她的痛苦现在附加上了怨恨。

“我敢肯定我所承受的痛苦，对你来说根本不算回事。”

“我们不要再相互指责了吧。”他回答道。

她绝望地哭喊了出来。她全身心地爱着他，现在却对他满腔哀怨，这也太可怕了，他不可能理解他在她心里的分量。

“噢，查理，你难道不知道我有多爱你吗？”

“但是，亲爱的，我也爱你。可我们不是生活在荒岛上，我们得尽一切努力从目前的困境中解脱出来，你真的必须保持理智。”

“我怎么能保持理智？对我来说，我们的爱情就是一切，你是我的整个生命，而我现在认识到，对你来说，我不过是你生命中的一段小插曲，这可无法让我高兴起来。”

“你当然不会是一段小插曲。但你得知道，你要求我离开我妻子——对于她，我是很依赖的——让我跟她离婚，而且要因为娶了你毁了我的前程，你的要求就有点儿过分了。”

“要是换作我，我是愿意为你放弃一切的。”

“咱俩的情况不一样。”

“唯一不同的就是你不爱我。”

“一个男人深爱着一个女人，并不意味着希望余生和她一起度过。”

她快速地看了他一眼，绝望又一次占据了她的身心，她忍不住又一次泪如雨下。

“噢，太残忍了，你怎么能如此绝情？”

她开始歇斯底里地哭泣着，他焦急地看了一眼房门。

“亲爱的，试着控制一下你自己。”

“你不知道我有多爱你。”她喘了一口气说，“没有你我无法活下去。你真的一点儿都不可怜我吗？”

她不再说什么了，只是不住地抽泣。

“我也不想这样，老天知道我不想伤害你的感情，但我必须告诉你实情。”

“你已经毁掉了我的整个生活。为什么你不能让我好好生活，要来招惹我？我究竟欠你什么了？”

“如果你觉得好受些，当然可以把一切都怪在我头上。”

突如其来的愤怒让凯蒂像火山一样爆发了。

“我想我是主动向你投怀送抱了，我想我是缠着你不放，让你不得安宁了，直到你不得不答应我的求欢。”

“我并没有这样说。但是，如果你没有清楚地表明你已经准备好要和我做爱的话，显然当初我不会想到要和你做爱的。”

啊，多丢人呀！她知道他的话没有错。他的脸现在变得更加阴沉和焦虑，他的手也不安地乱动。时不时地，他会生气地瞟她一眼。

“你丈夫不会原谅你吗？”过了一会儿，他问道。

“我绝不会乞求他的原谅。”

本能地，他握紧了双手。她看出他把到了嘴边的气话咽了回去。

“你为什么不去跟他谈谈，主动请求他的原谅？如果他真像你说的那么爱你的话，他肯定会原谅你的。”

“你真的一点儿也不了解他！”





第二十六章


她擦干了眼泪，试图镇定一下自己。

“查理，如果你把我抛弃，我会死的。”

现在她被迫开始想唤起他的同情了，也许早应该告诉他这一点了。这样当他知道她面临的可怕的生死抉择时，就会强烈激发起他的慷慨大度、他的正义之感、他的男子汉气概，他会考虑到她的危险而不会顾虑到其他的事情的。噢，她是多么充满激情地渴望他那亲切、有力的臂膀抱着她，保护她呀！

“沃尔特想让我去湄潭府。”

“呃，但是那个地方正在流行霍乱，正在遭遇五十年来最严重的瘟疫，不是女人该去的地方，你千万别去那儿。”

“如果你不管我，我就不得不去了。”

“你什么意思？我没明白。”

“沃尔特正打算替代那儿已经死去的传教士医生的位置，他想让我跟他一起去。”

“什么时候？”

“现在，马上动身。”

查理把椅子向后推开，困惑地看着她。

“我也许反应很迟钝，但我确实没搞明白你在说什么，如果他想让你跟他去那个地方，那离婚又是怎么回事？”

“他让我做出选择，要么我去湄潭府，要么他就要提出诉讼。”

“哦，我明白了。”汤森说话的口吻又开始有了些许的变化，“我倒是认为他相当勇气可嘉，不是吗？”

“勇气可嘉？”

“好了，他把去那儿当成见鬼的运动项目了，我可从来不敢想，当他回来的时候，毫无疑问会获得圣迈克尔和圣乔治勋爵荣衔[1]的。”

“但是我怎么办，查理？”她喊道，声音中带着极度的痛苦。

“好吧，我觉得如果他想让你去，在目前的状况下，我看你不好拒绝。”

“那意味着死亡，绝对的不归之路。”

“哦，老天爷，你太夸张了。如果他也这样认为的话，他是不会带上你的。与其说是你有危险，还不如说他的危险更大些。事实上，如果你加些小心，是不会冒很大的风险的。那儿闹霍乱的时候，我去过那儿，不是也毫发无损嘛。重要的是不要吃没煮熟的东西，不要吃生的水果和沙拉，或者诸如此类的东西，而且还要注意饮用水要煮沸。”他不断地往下说，信心也慢慢恢复了，言辞变得流利起来，甚至不再那么沉着脸了，神色也阴转晴了，几乎又轻松愉快了，“不管怎么说，那是他的工作，不是吗？他对细菌感兴趣，如果你考虑到这一点，对他来说，这还真是个千载难逢的好机会呢。”

“可我呢，查理？”她又重复道，但这次声音里不再有痛苦了，有的只是惊愕。

“嗯，理解一个男人的最好方式是换位思考，从他的角度上看，你是个相当淘气的小东西，他想让你别再闯祸了。我一直在想，他绝对不想跟你离婚，我印象中他绝不是那样的人。相反，他打定主意要给你提供一个慷慨大方的条件，而你却置之不理，不想接受。我不想责怪你，但如果你能真的为我们俩着想，我觉得你早就应该考虑一下这个条件了。”

“但是你看不出来这会害死我吗？难道你不明白他之所以要带我去那儿，就是因为他知道这样可以害死我吗？”

“哦，亲爱的，不要这样说嘛，我们现在的处境是相当尴尬的，真的没有时间去异想天开、耸人听闻了。”

“你已经铁了心不想去弄明白原委了。”噢，她心中的痛苦和恐惧几乎让她尖叫起来，“你不能把我推向死亡，即使你对我没有爱情和怜悯，你应该还有正常人的感情呀。”

“我认为你这样说我有点儿过于刻薄了。就我目前的判断，你丈夫的行为已经够宽宏大量的了，如果你听从他的条件，他愿意原谅你。他想带你走，不过是把你带到某个地方待上几个月，你就不会再闯祸了。我不能假装说湄潭府是一个让人身心健康的胜地，但是也没有什么理由紧张兮兮的。实际上，你要是过度紧张反而是最糟糕的事情。我认为，在一场瘟疫当中，死于恐惧的人和纯粹死于感染的人一样多。”

“可是我现在就怕得要死，当沃尔特说到这事的时候，我都快吓晕过去了。”

“在一开始的时候，我能十分理解，这听上去确实吓人，但是当你冷静下来再看待它时，就很平常了，它会是某种并非每个人都能拥有的体验。”

“我还以为，我还以为……”

她在痛苦中摇摆不定，他也不再说话，脸再一次阴沉了下来，这副表情是她以前从来没见过的。凯蒂现在不哭了，她的眼泪已经哭干。她冷静下来，虽然声音还是低沉的，但已经平稳了。

“你是想让我去，是吗？”

“除此之外，别无选择，不是吗？”

“是吗？”

“我直截了当地告诉你吧，如果你丈夫闹到法庭要跟你离婚，而且赢了离婚官司，我也不会娶你的。”

他似乎等待了很长时间，才听到她的回答，她慢慢站起身来。

“我认为我丈夫从来没想过提出离婚诉讼。”

“那么看在上帝的分儿上，你为什么要一直吓唬我，让我不知所措呢？”他问道。

她冷冷地看着他。

“他知道你会牺牲掉我的。”

她安静了下来，模模糊糊地意识到了什么，就像你在学习一门外语，或者读一段你完全不明就里的文字，直到一个词或者一个句子给了你某种提示，在半信半疑之间，你受到困扰的头脑突然灵光一现。她隐隐约约地寻到了一种迹象，能够摸透沃尔特的思路，就像一道闪电划过了黑暗和预示着不祥的夜空，但片刻之后，又隐藏在了黑夜之中。她对所看到的一切感到不寒而栗。

“他之所以这样威胁我，是因为他知道这样可以把你逼到墙角，查理。也真是怪了，他把你看得那么准，就像他能把我暴露在残忍的幻灭之中，让我彻底清醒。”

查理低头看着面前的一张吸墨纸，皱着眉，嘴角耷拉着，但没有作声。

“他知道你是虚伪、懦弱和自私的。他想让我用自己的眼睛看清这一点；他知道在危险来临的时候，你会像兔子一样逃脱；他知道我被你的花言巧语骗得晕头转向，以为你爱我，其实他清楚你除了你自己，是不会真正爱上别人的；他知道你会毫不心疼地牺牲掉我，来挽救你的颜面。”

“如果说这些恶毒的话能让你满意，我觉得我没有权利再争辩什么了。女人们总是不太公平，她们通常会冤枉一个男人，但是另外一方是有苦衷的。”

她没有注意到他的插话。

“现在我也知道了他所察觉到的一切，知道你是个铁石心肠、薄情寡义的人，知道你是个自私的人，自私得无以言表，知道你是个胆小如鼠的人，知道你是个满嘴谎话和花言巧语的人，知道你是个彻头彻尾的卑鄙的小人。但可悲的是……”她的脸因为极度的痛苦而扭曲，“可悲的是，即使是这样，我还在全心全意地爱着你。”

“凯蒂。”

她发出了一声苦笑。他总是能用一种融化人心的、语气丰富的、随时可用的声音呼唤她的名字，但根本没有什么实质内容。

“你个蠢货。”她说道。

他迅速地后退了一步，面红耳赤，感觉受到了冒犯，他不明白她什么意思。她瞥了他一眼，眼光中有着一丝戏谑。

“你现在开始讨厌我了，是吧？好吧，随你便吧，现在对我来说也无所谓了。”

她开始戴手套了。

“你下一步要干什么？”他问道。

“哦，别害怕，你不会受到什么伤害的，你很安全。”

“看在上帝的分儿上，别那么说话，凯蒂。”他回答道，低沉的声音中透着焦虑，“你得明白我们是一条绳上的蚂蚱，我对接下来会发生的事十分担惊受怕，你会对你丈夫说些什么？”

“我会告诉他我准备和他一起去湄潭府。”

“兴许你同意了，他倒不再坚持了。”

他不知道为什么，当他说这话的时候，她用一种很奇怪的表情看着他。

“你真的不害怕吗？”他问她。

“不怕。”她说道，“你激发了我的勇气，去霍乱瘟疫爆发的中心将会是一次独特的体验，而且如果我死了——呃，就让我死吧。”

“我是想尽可能地对你好的。”

她再次看着他，泪水再一次涌了出来，心里被某种情绪充得满满的，几乎有一种抑制不住的冲动想扑到他的怀中，把她的双唇紧紧地压在他的双唇上。但是已经没用了。

“如果你想知道，”她说道，试图让她的声音趋于平稳，“我心里明白，这是在赴死，我也很恐惧。我不知道沃尔特黑暗、扭曲的内心是怎么想的，我因为害怕而发抖，可死亡对我来说也许真的是一种解脱。”

她觉得再待一会儿她会控制不了自己的，于是在他有时间从椅子边站起身之前，快步走到了门边，开门走了。汤森如释重负地发出一声长长的叹息，他现在很想喝上一杯带苏打水的白兰地。

第二十七章


她回到家里的时候，沃尔特也在家。她本来想直接回自己的房间，但他正在楼下的大厅里，向一个男仆人布置着任务。她觉得自己那么不幸，准备硬着头皮面对来自他的羞辱。

“我跟你一起去那个地方。”她说道。

“哦，好的。”

“你什么时候让我准备妥当？”

“明天晚上。”

他的冷漠就像一把利矛刺痛了她，她也不知道从哪儿冒出了勇气，说了一句让她自己也感到吃惊的话。

“我想也不需要准备太多的东西了，只需要一些夏天的衣物和一套寿衣就好了，不是吗？”

她直视他的脸，知道她无礼的言辞激怒了他。

“你需要什么东西我已经跟你的女仆说过了。”

她点了点头，走上楼进了她的房间，面色像死人一样白。





第二十八章


他们终于快到目的地了。他们在轿椅上被人抬着，一天又一天，沿着一条狭窄的、无休无止的稻田堤道行进。他们在黎明时分动身，一直走着，直到正午太阳的炎热迫使他们在路边的小酒馆乘凉和歇脚。然后他们又继续上路，到达某个城镇后，预备在那儿过夜。凯蒂的轿椅在前面，沃尔特的紧随其后，落在最后面的是一群苦力，他们背着被褥、日杂用品和医疗实验设备。凯蒂经过乡村的时候，感觉到有很多看不见的眼睛在注视着她。在漫长的旅途中，沉寂会被轿夫们偶尔的谈话所打破，或者有人扯开嗓子干号几段粗俗的小调。她受尽折磨的脑海中翻来覆去地播放着在查理办公室里撕心裂肺的一幕幕，她回忆着他的话，以及她对他所说的话，难过地发现他们的对话从过去的甜言蜜语变成了枯燥无味和讨价还价的语言。她没有说出想说的话，而说话的语气也不是她的本意，要是能让他明白她对他无尽的爱，她心中的激情，以及她的无助，他就绝不可能那么不近人情地把她交给命运摆布。当他明白无误地告诉她，他对她根本不在乎的时候，她几乎不能相信自己的耳朵，完全蒙了，这也能解释为什么她甚至都没有放声大哭。她已经晕头转向，不知所措了。从那时起，她总暗自流泪，悲伤的眼泪几乎一直没有停过。

在小旅店过夜的时候，凯蒂和丈夫一起住在主客房中，她能够感觉到躺在离她几英尺远的行军床上的沃尔特也没有睡着。她用牙咬紧枕头，不让自己哭出声来。但是在白天的时候，在轿椅帘子的保护下，她让眼泪无声地流淌。在痛彻心扉的感觉达到顶点的时候，她恨不得发出声嘶力竭的呼喊。她以前从不知道一个人能遭受这么大的痛苦，所以经常绝望地扪心自问，她造了什么孽，要得到这样的报应。她不明白为什么查理不爱她了，有时思忖，也许是她的错，但是她已经用尽浑身解数来取悦他，让他欣赏自己。他们一直相处得很好，在一起时，有数不尽的欢笑，他们不仅是情人关系，也是志同道合的好朋友。她无法理解，精神都快崩溃了，不时地告诫自己她憎恨和鄙视他，可如果再也见不到他，她不知道自己应该如何继续生活下去。如果沃尔特把她带到湄潭府来是为了惩罚她，那么他就大错特错了，她现在这个样子，还在乎什么呢？她就是个活死人，但要在她仅仅二十七岁的时候就结束一切，似乎也不太容易。





第二十九章


轮船载着他们沿着西江逆流而上。沃尔特一直在读书看报，但在吃饭的时候，他还是竭力想找些话题来聊天。他跟她说话的态度好像她是他在旅途中碰巧遇到的陌生人，出于礼貌，谈些无关紧要的事情。凯蒂想象，或者因为这样，他才能表达出两个人之间隔着一道鸿沟。

在她洞察到沃尔特阴谋的瞬间，她曾告诉查理，沃尔特以离婚相威胁让她去找他，而另一个选项是让她陪沃尔特去遭受瘟疫的城市，目的就是让她自己看清查理是多么的冷漠、懦弱和自私。这种直觉看来是正确的，这手段完全符合他冷嘲式的幽默，他准确地预测到了她和查理会面后的结局，所以在她回来之前，他已经向女仆下达了替她收拾行李的指令。她在他的眼中似乎看到了某种不屑，既包括对他情人的，也包括对她的。也许他还会自言自语地说，如果他和汤森调换个位置，他愿意克服重重障碍，做出任何牺牲去满足她的一切愿望，她也知道他真的会去那么做。但是，每当她把眼睛睁开，从乱麻的思绪中回到现实，就会埋怨他怎么能把她带到如此危险的地方，难道他不知道这会吓得她不轻吗？起初，她认为他只是吓唬吓唬她，直到他们真的启程上路，不对，是再后来，直到他们离船登岸，又坐上轿椅，开始穿过乡间的旅程的时候，她还以为他会对她笑笑说，她不需要来这儿。她不知道他是怎么想的，但他不会真的希望她死吧，因为他曾经不顾一切地爱她。她现在明白爱情是什么了，而且记起了他对她的千般好。对于沃尔特，用一个法语谚语来说，她的确身在福中不知福。但他不可能不再爱她了呀，因为你受到了虐待，你就会停止爱一个人吗？查理让她痛不欲生，她起码没有像查理对她那样让沃尔特那么痛苦。如果查理给她些暗示，哪怕是一点点，即使现在她已经认清了他，她也会抛弃所有的一切，飞奔向他的怀抱。即使他牺牲了她，不顾她的死活，即使他铁石心肠和无情无义，她还是爱他。

最初，她认为自己只需熬过这段时间，沃尔特迟早会原谅她的。她对自己在他心目中的地位过于自信，觉得事情很快就会过去。大水扑不灭爱的火焰，只要他爱她——她觉得他必须爱她——他就不会强硬下去，但是，现在她开始不那么有信心了。傍晚时分，他坐在旅店直背的黑木椅上读书，借着马灯的灯光她能方便地观察到他的脸。她正躺在一个目前就作为床来使用的垫子上，正好处于光线的背影处，他脸上笔直规则的棱角，使得他的神情看上去十分冷峻，你无法相信这张严肃的脸有时候也会泛起甜蜜的微笑。他能够把书读得如此专注和安静，好像她离他有十万八千里远。他一页一页地翻着书，眼睛一行一行有规律地移动，好像身边没有她这个人似的。当饭桌摆好，晚饭端上来的时候，他把书放到了一边，瞥了她一眼（他不知道照在他脸上的光线使他的表情被凯蒂看得一清二楚），她吃惊地发现他的眼中是一副对她从心底里厌恶的神情。是的，这神情吓坏了她。是不是他对她的爱可能已经完全没有了？有没有可能他确实在设计让她去死？真是荒唐，只有疯子才会这么干。但从目前发生的一切来看，确实有些匪夷所思。当她想到沃尔特其实并没有发疯，觉得从头到脚掠过一阵寒意。





第三十章


突然，轿夫们经过很长一段时间的沉寂后开始叽叽喳喳说话了。其中一个轿夫转过身来，用她听不懂的话在说着什么，边说边打手势，想引起她的注意。她顺着他指的方向看去，在一个小山丘的山顶，耸立着一个拱门，她现在已经知道它是某种纪念碑，为了表彰某位先贤雅士或者贞洁的寡妇而建。他们自从上了河岸，一路上见了不少这样的牌坊。但是，这个牌坊在正在西下的太阳的映衬下，比她所见过的所有牌坊更为辉煌和漂亮。可不知为什么，它让她觉得不安，它有一种让她无法用言语描述的含义，是一种她隐约能察觉到的威胁吗？或是某种嘲弄？他们走进一片竹林，一根根竹子诡异地斜压着堤道，好像是要阻挡她前行。虽然夏天的晚上没有一丝微风，但细长、翠绿的竹叶却在微微颤动，给了她一种感觉，好像有人正躲在竹林里看着她经过。这时，他们已经走到山脚下，田埂路已经走到头了，轿夫们用摇摆的步伐沿着山路向上爬。小山丘上遍布着绿色的土堆，一个挨一个，密密匝匝，就像潮水退后，海滩上一排排的沙丘。她也知道这是什么，因为他们每进出一个人口稠密的城镇，都会经过这样的地方——坟场。现在她终于知道为什么轿夫们让她注意矗立在山顶的拱门了，他们已经到了旅途的终点。

他们通过了拱门，轿夫们歇了一下脚，把轿杠从一个肩上换到另一个肩上，有的人也趁机用脏兮兮的毛巾擦了擦满是汗水的脸。然后，堤道又向下蜿蜒了一小段路，道路的两旁有一些脏兮兮的房子。现在夜幕已经降临，但轿夫们又突然叽叽喳喳地说起话来，而且她感觉到轿椅一震，差点儿把她晃了下来，轿夫们紧紧贴着墙站立着。不一会儿，她就明白是什么惊吓着他们了。他们站在那儿，嘀咕着什么。四个农民悄无声息地从他们身边迅速通过，他们抬着一口崭新的棺材，这口棺材还没有刷油漆，在渐渐浓重的夜色中露出白花花的新木板的颜色。凯蒂觉得她的心被吓得怦怦直跳，都快到嗓子眼儿了。抬棺材的队伍已经过去，但轿夫们还愣愣地站着，好像还无法鼓起勇气继续前进。这时，不知谁在后面喊了一嗓子，他们又开始上路了，谁都没有说话。

他们又走了好几分钟，然后拐了个急弯，来到一个院落开阔的入口处。轿椅被慢慢放到了地上，她终于到家了。





第三十一章


那是一座平房，她走进客厅坐了下来。这时，苦力们三三两两地把他们带的物品都卸了进来。沃尔特在院子里指挥着他们摆放物品。她觉得很累，但被一个不熟悉的声音吓了一大跳。

“我能进来吗？”

她的脸先是红了一下，然后又变白了。她变得神经紧张，所以遇见个陌生人让她一时不知所措。这个人好像从黑暗中走进来，因为狭长低矮的房间只有一个带罩的油灯。他伸出了手。

“我叫威廷顿，是这里的副专员。”

“哦，是海关的，我知道，我听说过您。”

在昏暗的灯光下，她只能大概看清他是个身材矮小的男人，跟她个头差不多，秃头，有一张没有胡须的小脸盘。

“我就住在山脚下，但是在来的路上，你们可能看不见我的房子。我想您可能累坏了，无法过来一起和我共进晚餐，所以我在这儿让人把饭给你们做好了，我本人也不请自来了。”

“我很高兴见到您。”

“您可能会发现厨师还不错，我让魏特森的仆人供您差遣。”

“魏特森是从前在这儿的那位传教士吗？”

“是的，一位很好的人。如果您愿意，我明天带您到他的墓上看看。”

“您真是太好了。”凯蒂面带微笑地说道。

这时，沃尔特走了进来。在威廷顿见到凯蒂之前，他已经向沃尔特做过自我介绍了，于是他对沃尔特说道：

“我已经征得你太太的同意与你们共进晚餐。在魏特森去世后，除了那些法国修女外，再没有什么能跟我多说几句话的人了，再加上我的法语也不太灵光，而且，跟她们能谈的话题也很有限。”

“我刚才已经告诉伙计拿些喝的进来。”沃尔特说道。

仆人拿来了威士忌和苏打水，凯蒂注意到威廷顿一点儿也不见外，马上自斟自饮起来。从他说话的方式和动不动就呵呵傻笑，她已经猜到他进屋时就已经半醉了。

“能喝上这个就是运气呀。”他说道，然后转过头，冲着沃尔特，“你在这儿会忙得不可开交的。他们就像苍蝇一样成堆死去，地方官已经快失去理智了。还有余上校，这位军官气急败坏地命令部队不要干抢劫的勾当。如果还不赶紧采取点儿措施，我们很快就会被杀死在床上。我设法让修女们赶快离开这里，但是她们不会离开，她们都想成为殉道者，真该死。”

他说得很轻松，话语中有一种吓人的幽默，所以你不得不带着微笑听他说完。

“那你为什么不走？”沃尔特问道。

“呃，我一半的员工已经丢掉了性命，其他的人也随时会倒下，然后死去。但总得有人留下来收拾后事吧？”

“你已经打了疫苗了吗？”

“打了，魏特森给我打的。但是，他自己也给自己打了呀，可是对他来说没起多大作用，可怜的笨蛋。”他转向凯蒂，他可笑的小脸因为快乐而起了皱纹。“我认为如果你采取适当的预防措施，不会有太大的风险。一定要把你的牛奶和饮用水煮沸，不要吃新鲜的水果或者没烹饪过的蔬菜。你这次带留声机的唱片了吗？”

“没有，我觉得好像没带。”凯蒂说道。

“那太遗憾了，我真希望你能带一些来。我好长时间没有听唱片了，手头的那些我已经听腻了。”

仆人进来问是否可以上菜了。

“你今晚不会换晚礼服了，是吧？”威廷顿问道，“我的男仆上周死了，现在用的这个男仆是个傻瓜，所以我在晚上就再也没换过晚礼服了。”

“我去摘下帽子。”凯蒂说道。

她的卧室就在他们落座的隔壁，几乎没有什么家具。旁边放了一盏油灯，一个女仆跪在地板上，正在整理凯蒂的行装。





第三十二章


餐厅不大，而一张很大的桌子占据了房间的大部分空间，四面墙上挂着取材于圣经故事的版画和相应的说明文字。

“传教士们总是有着很大的餐桌，”威廷顿解释道，“他们一年多点就会有一个孩子，所以在他们刚一结婚的时候，就会买上一张大桌子，以便有足够的地儿留给这些小不速之客。”

餐厅的屋顶悬挂着一盏煤油灯，所以凯蒂能够更好地看清威廷顿的尊荣。他的秃顶让她误以为他不再年轻，但现在她看清了，他肯定没有四十岁，又高又圆的前额之下是一张小脸，没有什么棱角，但是很红润，虽然丑得像猴子，但也不能说不忍直视，应该说这是一张蛮逗趣的脸。他的鼻子和嘴比一个孩子的也大不了多少。他有一双很小，但是又亮又圆的蓝眼睛。他的眉毛又淡又稀，看上去像一个未老先衰的小男孩。在晚餐进行的过程中他不停地给自己倒酒，显然已经快醉了。但即使他已经喝醉了，也没有出口伤人，而是快快乐乐地，如同一个半人半兽的森林之神萨堤[1]，从睡着的牧羊人那里偷走酒囊。

他谈到了香港，在那儿他有很多朋友，他想了解他们的近况。一年前他曾在香港赌了好几次马，他谈到了那些赛马和他们的主人。

“顺便问一句，汤森怎么样了？”他突然问道，“他当上殖民地大臣了吗？”

凯蒂觉得自己的脸唰地一下红了，但是她的丈夫并没有看她。

“我觉得不出意外应该不成问题。”沃尔特答道。

“他是那种能往上爬的人。”

“你认识他？”沃尔特问道。

“是的，我和他很熟。我们还曾经一起外出旅游过。”

他们听见从河的对岸传来了敲锣声，还有爆竹噼啪作响的声音。在那儿，就在距离他们不远的地方，这座大一些的城市正处于恐怖之中，死神，突如其来而又冷酷无情地匆匆掠过它弯弯曲曲的街道。威廷顿开始说起伦敦，谈到了那儿的剧院，他甚至知道当下正在上演的剧目，他告诉他们上次休假回国时，他看了什么样的演出。他回忆起低俗的喜剧人物的幽默时，会哈哈大笑，而回忆起音乐喜剧中明星的美丽时，又会发出声声叹息。他很开心地吹嘘他的一个表弟就娶了一位最出名的明星，他还和这位明星一起吃过午餐，她还送了他自己的玉照，等下次他们来海关一起和他共进晚餐时，他会拿给他们看的。

沃尔特用一种冷淡和讽刺的眼神看着他的客人，很显然他没有受到对方逗趣谈吐的影响，但是他还是尽力装出有礼貌的样子，好像对那些话题感兴趣。其实凯蒂很清楚，他对这些话题一无所知，但一丝淡淡的微笑始终挂在嘴角。然而凯蒂不知道为什么心中充满了敬畏。这座已经死去的传教士留下的房子正对着瘟疫肆虐的城市，他们似乎与整个世界相隔离，三个孤独而又彼此陌生的人相对而坐。

晚餐吃完了，她从桌边站起身来。

“你不介意我跟您道晚安吧？我想去睡了。”

“我也要告退了，我希望医生也早点儿休息。”威廷顿回答道，“我们明天一大早就得出发。”

他和凯蒂握了握手，步伐倒是很稳，但他的眼睛比以往更亮了。

“明天我会来接你。”他跟沃尔特说道，“带你去见地方官和余上校，然后我们一起去女修道院。我告诉你，你可有的忙了。”

第三十三章


整个晚上她被一个接着一个奇怪的梦所惊扰，似乎是被轿椅抬着，随着轿夫们漫长、不稳的步伐，她感觉到了摇晃的节奏。她穿过一座座城市，空旷而昏暗，成群的人挤在一起用好奇的目光盯着她。街道狭窄而且弯弯曲曲，在开着的商店中，摆满了奇怪的商品。当她经过的时候，所有的车辆行人都停了下来，那些买和卖的人也暂停了交易。然后，她又来到了牌坊跟前，它怪诞的造型好像突然变成了庞然大物，它变化无常的外形就像一尊印度神在挥动着多条手臂，而且，她从底下路过的时候，分明听到了嘲笑声在回荡。但就在这时，查理来到了她身旁，把她揽入怀中，把她从轿椅上抱起，告诉她一切都是个错误，他那样对待她绝非他的本意，因为他爱她，没有她活不下去。她觉得他的吻印在了她的唇上，她喜极而泣，责怪他为什么那么残忍，但是虽然她嘴上质问他，心中早就不当回事了。就在这时，她突然听见一声沙哑的哭喊，他们分开了，在他们中间，匆忙地走来一群沉默的苦力，他们穿着蓝色的破衣烂衫，正抬着一口棺材。

她猛地惊醒了。

她住的平房矗立在一个陡峭山丘的半山腰，从窗户可以看到下面狭长的河流，以及对面的城镇。刚刚破晓，河面上升起了一团白色的雾气，就像白色的寿衣笼罩着停泊在河上的平底帆船，这些小船一个挨一个地紧紧靠在一起，如同豆荚里的一粒粒豌豆，数量达到了数百艘之多，在鬼魅般的光线下，它们安静、神秘。而且你会产生一种错觉，船夫们好像被施了魔法，因为看上去并不像在睡梦当中，而是有种诡异和可怕的东西把他们牢牢地定在那里，寂静无声。

随着清晨的临近，阳光接触到了雾气，雾气映射着白光，就像在一个垂死星球上雪白的幽灵。虽然河面上有了亮光，你能够分辨出拥挤的帆船白色的轮廓，还有如林般的桅杆，但是在这些船的前面是闪亮的雾墙，肉眼无法看透。突然在白色的团雾中，一座高大威严的巨型堡垒出现了，好像不仅仅会因光芒四射的太阳照耀才能让人看见，而是因为魔杖的一点它才升起于无形当中，它像塔一样高高耸立在河面上，是残酷和野蛮种族的据点。然而，修建它的魔术师工程完成得太快，现在只剩下堡垒顶部的彩色砖墙的残迹。一会儿工夫，在团雾之外，出现了巨大的海市蜃楼景象，太阳金黄色的光线到处漫射，似乎还能看到一排排绿色和黄色相间的屋顶，它们似乎很大，你无法判断出是哪一种建筑风格；井井有条，如果说它们井井有条的话，你也无法察觉到。一切都是放任自流和肆意挥霍的，一切都是无法想象的丰富多彩。实际上，根本没有什么堡垒，没有什么庙宇，有的只是某位神灵的神奇宫殿，没人涉足过。它悬在空中，金碧辉煌、虚无缥缈，绝非出自凡人之手，它是梦的产物。

泪水滑过凯蒂的脸庞，她凝视着前方的景物，一只手紧贴胸口，一只手紧捂着嘴，因为无法呼吸，她的嘴略微张开着。她从来没有觉得心有如此轻飘，对她来说，身体只是一个躯壳，剩下的是纯粹的灵魂，美丽就驻留在这儿，她把它当作信徒正在往嘴里放的圣饼，而圣饼就是上帝的化身。





第三十四章


沃尔特一大早就出去了，只在午饭的时候回来了半个小时，然后就没再回来，直到晚餐准备好的时候，凯蒂发现屋子里就只有她一个人。有好几天了，她根本没有出屋，天很热，大部分时间她都躺在长椅上，椅子放在开着的窗户边，她想让自己把书读进去。正午的阳光光线很强，现在那座神奇宫殿的神秘气息已经荡然无存，它只不过是城墙上的庙宇，俗气华丽但很破败，但是因为她曾在迷幻之中见识过它的壮观，所以在她心中它不再是一个普通的地方。她经常在拂晓或者日落的时候，甚至在夜晚，一个人重温那种美。在她眼中，那个强大的堡垒只不过是城墙的幻觉，她的目光不停地落在这个宽大的、黑乎乎的城墙上，而城墙大炮垛口后面的这座城市，正遭受着瘟疫肆虐的蹂躏。

她大概了解了些在那里正在发生的可怕的事情，但这种了解不是从沃尔特那儿知道的。当她问他情况时（否则的话，他很少跟她讲话），他的回答往往是打哈哈似的漫不经心，这使得她脊背发凉，但是从威廷顿和女仆那里，她还是多少知道了一些情况。现在的情景是平均每天会有一百人感染死亡，几乎没有什么人能够感染瘟疫后康复。各种神像已经从废弃的庙宇中被搬了出来，放到大街上。神像前摆满了各种供奉品和各种牺牲的祭品，但是这仍然没有阻止瘟疫的蔓延。病人死得太快了，几乎没有时间去安葬他们。有些人家几乎都灭门绝户了，没有活着的家人来操办葬礼。部队的长官是个善于掌控局势的人，多亏了他的坚定果敢，整个城镇才没有陷入暴乱和纵火。他命令他的士兵们去掩埋没人理睬的尸体，他还亲手枪毙了一个军官，因为他反对士兵进入受灾的房子。

有时凯蒂真的吓坏了，全身颤抖，她的心沉甸甸的。如果采取合理的预防措施，风险就不大，这话说起来容易，做起来可就难了。她整天提心吊胆，甚至还仔细考虑过一个疯狂的逃跑计划，离开这儿，只要离开这儿。当她一个人的时候，或者找机会一个人待着的时候，她就做好出发的准备，别无所图，只求能够待在一个安全的地方。她曾考虑要不要借助威廷顿，赢得他的怜悯，告诉他事情的来龙去脉，请求他帮助她回到香港。或者如果她屈尊跪在她丈夫面前，坦承她怕得要死，即使他现在恨她，也一定会有足够的人情味去可怜她的。

但也有问题。如果她走了，她可以去哪儿？不能回母亲家，她母亲已经让她看得很明白了，巴不得让她出嫁赶紧走人，整天琢磨怎么摆脱她，况且她自己也不想回母亲家。她想去找查理，但他不想要她了，假如突然出现在他面前，她知道他会说些什么话。她会看见他脸上阴沉的表情，以及在他迷人眼神后面的精明与算计，他很难和颜悦色地对她说什么好话。她握紧了拳头，真希望当时自己能说些针锋相对的话来回击他的羞辱。有时她会被一阵狂乱所控制，如果当初沃尔特和她离婚就好了。只要她能毁掉查理，毁掉自己也在所不惜。当回忆起查理说过的某些话时，她羞愧得脸都红了。





第三十五章


她第一次单独和威廷顿待在一起时，故意把话题引向了查理。在他们到达这里的那天晚上，威廷顿曾经谈起过他，她假装查理只不过是她丈夫的一个熟人。

“我不怎么待见他。”威廷顿说道，“我总是觉得他这个人挺烦人的。”

“您一定很挑剔。”凯蒂回应道，用一种她信手拈来的打趣方式，把话说得很轻松，“我认为他在香港可是数一数二的炙手可热的人物。”

“我知道。那正是他的钻营之道，他非常善于笼络人心，他有一种天赋，能让每个和他见面的人都觉得遇见了知音，如果对他来说是轻而易举的事，他总是愿意效劳，甚至他没有去做你让他帮忙的事，也会让你觉得这事是非人力所能及的，对他也充满感激。”

“那可真是有魅力。”

“除了魅力还是魅力，最后魅力变成了让人厌倦的东西。我这样觉得，跟一个更真诚一点儿，而不是特别殷勤的人打交道会更放松些。我认识查理很多年了，有那么一两次，我看到他摘下面具——你知道，我是个无足轻重的小人物，在海关也是个下级官员——我知道在这个世界上他不会为任何人付出一丁点儿东西的，他心里只有他自己。”

凯蒂很悠闲地坐在椅子上，用带着微笑的眼睛看着他，她在手指上一圈又一圈地转动着结婚戒指。

“当然，他会升官。他对官场的那一套很娴熟，在我有生之年，我坚信我会等到称呼他阁下大人，等他一进屋，我们都会起立致敬的那一天的。”

“很多人都认为他很有能力，应该得到提拔重用。”

“有能力？那可是看走了眼了，他很笨，可总给人一种印象，好像他能很麻利地干完手里的活，完全是由于他的聪明才干，实际上完全不是这么回事，他勤快得像个欧亚混血的职员，整天加班加点才能应付手头的工作。”

“那他怎么会赢得聪明能干的好名声呢？”

“这世界上有很多笨蛋，当一个身处高位的人，又没有什么架子，在这些人的后背友好地拍那么一下，告诉他们他将竭尽全力为他们服务，他们就很可能认为他聪明能干。当然啦，还有他的妻子，如果你愿意，也可以把她看作一个能干的女人，她的脑瓜儿相当灵光，她的建议总是切实可行，只要查理背后有了她，依靠她出主意，他就不会做出什么蠢事来，而在政府部门工作，这是一个男人的第一要务。政府部门并不想要聪明的人，聪明的人都有思想，而有思想又会招致麻烦，他们只想要有亲和力和会使手腕又绝不会捅娄子的人。哦，是的，查理一定会爬到官场的金字塔顶的。”

“我很好奇你为什么不喜欢他？”

“我没有不喜欢他。”

“但好像你更喜欢他太太？”凯蒂微笑着说。

“我是个传统的男人，喜欢有教养的女人。”

“我倒是希望她的穿着打扮配得上她的教养。”

“她的穿着打扮不得体吗？我从没注意到。”

“我总听到人们说，他们是一对模范夫妻。”凯蒂说道，同时眯着眼睛观察着他的表情。

“他很爱她，这点上他倒是值得称赞，我觉得这是有关他最体面的事了。”

“多苛刻的表扬。”

“他也经常跟人打情骂俏，但他从不会当真。他太狡猾了，不会让调情发展得太快太深，因为这样会给他造成不便。当然了，他不是一个用情很深的人，只会逢场作戏。他希望别人对他仰慕。他人已经发福，而且四十岁了，可是保养得很好，他刚到香港时，人长得很漂亮，我经常听他的妻子拿他的仰慕者们打趣。”

“她难道对他的风流韵事不在意吗？”

“哦，一点儿也不。因为她知道这些事都长久不了，她说她倒是愿意和那些爱上查理的可怜的小妇人交朋友，但是她们总是那么稀松平常。她说她对那些迷恋她丈夫的女人实在没法恭维，她们都是些二流货色。”





第三十六章


当威廷顿离开以后，凯蒂对他无心中说的那些话，想了又想。他的话让她听后很不舒服，她尽力装作若无其事的样子，显示出不为所动。但想想他说的句句是实话，也着实让她心里又苦又涩。她知道查理愚蠢而又虚荣，渴望人们对他奉承巴结。她现在还清晰地记得他自鸣得意地告诉她一些能证明他聪明的小段子，他对那些自以为聪明的小伎俩还很自豪。她曾经把自己的一颗真心动情地交到这样一个男人手中，只因为——因为他有一双好看的眼睛和优雅的外表，她多么不值呀！她希望自己鄙视他，因为只要她恨他，就说明自己还在爱着他，想想他是怎么对待她的，她真应该醒醒了。沃尔特也总是对他不屑一顾。噢，如果她能把他从她的思想里连根拔掉就好了！他的妻子是不是拿她对他的痴心迷恋来跟他打趣呢？多萝西好像喜欢跟她交朋友，但是内心却把她当成二流货色。凯蒂真是哭笑不得，如果她的母亲知道她的女儿被别人看成二流货色，她老人家该是多么生气呀！

然而，当天晚上她又梦见了他，她觉出他的双臂把她抱得紧紧的，热辣辣的吻印在她的唇上。他身体发福，人到四十又有什么关系？她心里充满柔情地笑着，因为他很介意他的年龄和体型。他孩子般的虚荣心反而让她更加爱他，同情他，安慰他。当她醒来的时候，发现自己泪如泉涌。

她不知道何种缘由，这梦境对她来说是悲剧性的，让她在睡梦中都在哭泣。





第三十七章


她每天都能见到威廷顿，因为他每天忙完工作后，都要溜达到山上，来到沃尔特家的平房做客。所以，一周之后他们变得很熟悉了，而这种关系要是放在以前的那种情境下，哪怕一年也几乎不可能这么亲密。有一次，当凯蒂告诉他说，如果没有他，她都不知道在这儿干些什么的时候，他笑着回答说：“你瞧，你和我是在这儿脚踏实地走路，十分安静而又平和的人，而修女们是在天堂里走路，而你的丈夫——是在黑暗中走路。”

虽然她不经意地笑笑，但还是想搞清楚他话中的含义。她觉得他快乐的小蓝眼睛正在扫视她的面孔，带着一种和蔼可亲但又有些困惑的神情。她已经发现了他实际上很精明，而且还有一种感觉，那就是她和沃尔特之间的关系激起了他的疑心，某种探奇的乐趣让他跃跃欲试。她喜欢他，也知道他能够友善地对待她，他既不聪明机智，也不才华横溢，但是他有种能够直截了当、拨乱反正的能力，而且在秃头之下，他滑稽的、孩子般的面孔由于大笑而变得扭曲，使得他的话有时格外的离奇古怪。他生活在这个边远村落有很多年了，通常没有同自己肤色一样的人来交谈，所以他的性格已经变得奇特而无拘无束，简直就是个古灵精怪的人，他的率真也让人耳目一新，似乎是用一种取乐的精神来看待生活。他对在香港的殖民极尽讽刺挖苦之能事，但他也嘲笑湄潭府的中国官员，甚至嘲笑使得城市死人无数的霍乱。他讲的悲剧故事或者英雄传奇也往往带上略微的荒诞色彩。对于在中国二十年间的冒险经历，他有很多奇闻逸事可讲，而且从这些逸事中，你能得出结论，我们所在的这个星球真是个荒诞不经、离奇古怪、荒唐可笑的地方。

虽然他否认他是个中国通（他发誓汉语像天书一样），但他汉语说得很流利。他基本上不读书看报，他所了解的知识都是从聊天中得来的。然而，他经常给凯蒂讲从中国小说和历史书上得来的故事，虽然他讲这些故事时是以打趣的口吻，对他来说这种口吻习以为常，但给凯蒂讲时却是生动活泼的，甚至还有些温柔。也许对于凯蒂，他无意识地采用了中国人的看法，认为欧洲人都是些野蛮人，他们的生活是一出讽刺剧，只有在中国，一个明智的人才能在混乱的生活中区分出现实。凯蒂从来没听到过中国人谈论过诸如此类的话，他们只谈论堕落、肮脏和无法启齿的话。就好像窗帘的一角被暂时掀了起来，她瞥见了一个丰富的世界，充满了她从未梦想过的色彩和意义。

他坐在那儿，一边聊着、笑着，一边喝着。

“你不认为你喝酒喝得太多了吗？”凯蒂有些唐突地对他说道。

“它是我生活的乐趣。”他回答说，“而且，它能预防霍乱呢。”

每次离开她家时，他通常都已经喝得醉醺醺了，但他却从来不呕吐，使得他非常滑稽，但是还是很和善。

有一天傍晚，沃尔特比平时回来得早一些，邀请威廷顿留下来吃晚饭。发生了一件稀奇的事。他们吃着鱼，喝着汤，然后仆人递给了凯蒂一份沙拉，鸡肉拌新鲜的绿色蔬菜。

“老天，你不要吃那个东西。”当威廷顿看到凯蒂正在往盘子里拨一些沙拉时，他喊道。

“没问题呀，我们每天晚上都吃这个。”

“我妻子喜欢这道菜。”沃尔特说道。

这道菜被递到了威廷顿的面前，但是他摇了摇头。

“多谢了，但我现在还不想自杀。”

沃尔特冷笑了一下，自己夹了一些沙拉。威廷顿不再吭声，事实上，他令人奇怪地不怎么爱说话了，晚饭后不久，他就向他们告辞了。

他们每天晚上都吃沙拉倒是千真万确，在他们到达后的两天，漫不经心的中国厨子就给他们端上了沙拉，而凯蒂没有丝毫犹豫，就吃了一些。沃尔特很快探过身去。

“你不应该吃的，这个厨子真是疯了，还上这道菜。”

“为什么不能吃？”凯蒂问道，直视着他的脸。

“吃生菜会有风险，这真是疯了，你会让自己送命的。”

“我觉得那正好。”凯蒂说道。

她不紧不慢地开始吃了起来，心里知道自己这样做并不是勇敢。她用嘲弄的眼光注视着沃尔特，看出他的脸色有点儿变白了，但把沙拉递给他时，他自己也拨到盘子里开始吃了。厨子发现他们并没有拒绝，就天天都给他们准备沙拉，他们也好像在追逐死亡似的，上来就吃，甘冒这样的风险，也真是稀奇古怪的行为。凯蒂其实对瘟疫怕得要死，吃沙拉时怀着一种心情，她不仅用这种方式对沃尔特进行威胁报复，而且表现出她对绝望恐惧的蔑视。





第三十八章


第二天，威廷顿又在下午来到了小平房，坐了一会儿后，他问凯蒂是否愿意跟他出去散散步。自从来到这里以后，凯蒂还没出过这个院落，她很高兴地接受了邀请。

“恐怕我们不能走得太远。”他说道，“但我们可以走到山顶上。”

“哦，是的，那儿有个拱门，我经常从门廊那儿望它。”

一个仆人为他们打开了沉重的铁门，他们走上了一条布满灰尘的小路，刚走出几码远，凯蒂突然惊恐地抓住了威廷顿的胳膊，发出一声惊叫。

“快看！”

“怎么了？”

在围着院落的墙角下，躺着一个男人，双腿伸展着，胳膊也伸直过头，穿着打满补丁的蓝色布褂，乱蓬蓬的头发很长，像是一个乞丐。

“看上去，他好像已经死了。”凯蒂上气不接下气地说。

“是死了，从旁边走，最好眼睛看着别处，我们回来的时候，我会让人把他抬走。”

但是凯蒂浑身颤抖得很厉害，她都挪不动步了。

“我以前从来没见过死人。”

“你最好还是尽快适应，因为你在这个地方真正安顿下来之前，会看到很多的死人。”

他拉起她的手，把它放到臂弯里，他们沉默地走了一会儿。

“他是死于霍乱吗？”她最后忍不住开口问道。

“我想是的。”

他们爬到了山顶，来到了牌坊前，牌坊上雕刻了很多图案，高大巍峨，但具有讽刺意味的是在周围的乡间显得很不协调，它矗立在那儿看上去好像一个地标。他们在石阶上坐下来，面朝着山下宽阔的平地。小山紧挨着一小块绿色的坟地，没有成排排列，而是散乱地东一座、西一座地分布，让你感觉到在坟丘的下面，尸骨也是奇怪地堆在一起。狭窄的田埂道在绿油油的稻田中间蜿蜒曲折地延展，一个小男孩正坐在水牛背上，赶着它慢慢地走回家，而三个戴着宽大草帽的农民，背着沉重的东西，迈着摇摇晃晃的步伐缓缓地跟在后面。正午的热气已经散去，傍晚在山顶上有一阵微风吹来，下面广阔的农田似乎给人一种安详的感觉，但对于受到折磨的心灵来说，也不乏忧郁的气息。然而，凯蒂的脑海中，那个死去的乞丐的形象总是挥之不去。

“在你身边人们纷纷死去的时候，你怎么还能聊天、说笑和大口喝威士忌呢？”她突然问道。

威廷顿没有回答，他转过身看着她，然后把手放到她的手臂上。

“你知道，这儿不是女人待的地方。”他严肃地说道，“你为什么不走呢？”

她从长长的睫毛下睨视了他一眼，嘴角露出了一丝微笑。

“我想在当前的情景下，一个妻子应该待的地方是她丈夫的身边。”

“当他们给我发电报说你和沃尔特一起过来，我当时真的很吃惊。可是后来我想你可能是一名护士，或者对这儿的工作能帮上忙，我希望你是个板着面孔的女医生，当有人生病住院时，你会让他们的日子不好受。可当我走进平房第一眼看见你坐在那儿休息时，让我大吃一惊，你看上去那么的纤弱、苍白和疲惫。”

“经过九天的长途跋涉，你不能指望我还是精神焕发呀。”

“你现在看上去也依然纤弱、苍白和疲惫。如果你能允许我说实话，再加上，看上去十分的不幸。”

凯蒂禁不住脸红了，但是她勉强笑了一声，听上去好像还算快乐。

“很抱歉你会不喜欢我的解释的，我看上去不快乐的唯一原因就是在我十二岁时，我知道我的鼻子有点儿太长了，但是怀揣这么一个秘密的悲伤，也是最有效的一招，你无法想象有多少年轻的满嘴甜言蜜语的男人想要安慰我。”

威廷顿用蓝色的闪亮的眼睛盯着她，她知道他其实并不相信她的话，只要他不当场拆穿，她倒是并不在意。

“我知道你结婚的时间并不长，我得出的结论是你和你的丈夫彼此疯狂地爱着对方，我无法相信他会希望你一起来。但是，也许你斩钉截铁地拒绝和他分开，独自留下来。”

“这倒是一个非常讲得通的理由。”她轻快地说道。

“是的，但这不是真正的原因。”

她等着他继续说下去，但又害怕他要说出的话，因为她非常清楚他很精明，也知道他直言不讳。然而，她还是无法抵抗住那种想听听他到底如何谈论她的诱惑。

“我一点儿也不相信你爱你丈夫，我觉得你不喜欢他，如果说你讨厌他，我也不会惊奇，但是我敢肯定你怕他。”

有那么一会儿，她看着别处，她并不打算让威廷顿看出他说的话影响到了她。

“你怀疑我不是很喜欢我丈夫。”她略带挖苦地说道。

“我尊重他，他有思想也有个性，而且，我可以告诉你，这两种特征结合到一个人身上很不寻常。我认为你不知道他在这儿每天都在干什么，因为我觉得他很少跟你交流。如果需要有人单枪匹马制止这场可怕的瘟疫，他一定会义无反顾地冲上阵。他为病人治疗，为整个城镇消毒，竭力使饮用水清洁。他不介意去任何地方，也不介意做任何事情，一天有二十次要冒着生命危险，他已经把余上校收入麾下，余上校对他言听计从，他力劝余上校要严肃军纪。他甚至给地方主官也增添了勇气，让这位上了岁数的老人也真的想方设法做点儿事了。修道院的修女们在他身边都发誓哪怕做出牺牲，也要治病救人。他们把他看作英雄。”

“你难道不把他看作英雄吗？”

“毕竟这些不是他的工作，不是吗？他是一名细菌学家，没人让他来这儿，他没让我觉得他是出于对所有垂死的人的同情心才来这儿的。魏特森不一样，他热爱芸芸众生，虽然他是个传教士，但在他的眼中，无论是天主教徒、佛教徒或者信奉儒家思想的人都没有什么不同，他们都是人类。你的丈夫不是因为他关心是否有成百上千的人死于霍乱才来这个地方的，也不是因为他出于对科学的兴趣，那么为什么他会来这儿呢？”

“你最好去问他。”

“让我感兴趣的是看到你们两个在一起，我有时很好奇，你们俩单独在一起时，会是什么样子。我在这儿的时候，你在表演，你们俩都在表演，但演技差极了，的确是这样。如果一个巡演剧团雇用了你俩，你们使出九牛二虎之力一周也挣不了三十个先令。”

“我不知道你这话是什么意思。”凯蒂笑着说，好像威廷顿在说一件轻松的乐事，但她心里明白，他所言非虚。

“你是个非常漂亮的女人，但你丈夫都不正眼瞧你一眼，这挺好笑。当他跟你说话时，听上去好像都不是他自己的声音，而是别人的声音。”

“你认为他不爱我吗？”凯蒂用低沉、沙哑的声音问道，刚才那种轻松的口吻突然不见了。

“我不知道，我不清楚是否你让他心里充满了厌恶，以致当他靠近你时，都会起鸡皮疙瘩。或者出于某种原因，他内心虽然炙热地爱着你，但并不显露出来。我对自己说，你们两个来这儿是不是要相约自杀。”

凯蒂曾经看到过威廷顿惊奇的目光，就是当吃沙拉的小插曲发生的时候，他向他俩投来的审视目光。

“我认为你把太多的重要性赋予那些生菜叶子了。”她唐突地说道，而且站起身来，“我们能回去了吗？我敢肯定你想喝威士忌加苏打水了。”

“无论如何你都不是个女中豪杰，你吓得要死，你确定你不想离开这儿吗？”

“这跟你有什么关系吗？”

“我会帮你。”

“你会没有注意到让我暗自神伤的外貌吗？看一下我的脸型，告诉我是否我的鼻子并不是太长呀。”

他若有所思地凝视着她，在他明亮的眼中能够看出恶作剧般的嘲弄的神色，但是背后是一种善意，就像河岸边矗立的一棵树，在水中可以看见倒影一样，在他的眼里还可以看见由衷的热心，这使得泪水突然在凯蒂的眼眶中打转转。

“你必须留下来吗？”

“是的。”

他们从华丽壮观的牌坊下穿过，向着山下走去。当他们走到院落的跟前时，又看到了那具乞丐的尸体。他拽着她的胳膊，但她挣脱了，静静地站立在那儿。

“太可怕了，不是吗？”

“你说什么？死亡吗？”

“是的，它使得一切都似乎显得那么微不足道，他看上去都不像个人，当你看着他时，你几乎都无法说服你自己他曾是个活生生的人，更难以想象就在没几年前，他还是个小男孩时，沿着下山的路猛跑，在放着风筝。”

她哽咽着，不能自已。





第三十九章


几天以后，威廷顿和凯蒂坐在一起，手里拿着一个长长的高脚杯，杯里盛满了威士忌加苏打水，开始向她谈论起女修道院的一些情况。

“修道院院长是个了不起的女人。”他说道，“修女们告诉我，她出身于法国的一个名门望族，但她们不愿意透露是哪一个家族，她们说，院长不希望谈论她的出身。”

“假如这事令你感兴趣，你为什么不亲自问问她呢？”凯蒂笑着问道。

“如果你认识她，你就会知道问她一个轻率的问题，是不可能得到回答的。”

“她能给你留下令人敬畏的印象，必定杰出非凡。”

“她让我给你捎个口信，说你可能不希望冒险进入疫区的中心，她当然能理解。但是如果你不介意的话，她会十分荣幸地领你参观一下修道院。”

“她太好了，我应该早想到她知道有我这么一个人。”

“我向她谈起过你。我一周能去两三次，去看看是否有什么我能做的事。另外，我敢说你丈夫也向她们说起过你，当你发现她们对你丈夫有着毫不掩饰的崇拜时，你可得有心理准备呀。”

“你是天主教徒吗？”

他狡黠的眼睛眨了眨，滑稽的小脸因为大笑而使五官挤在一起。

“你为什么冲着我傻笑？”凯蒂问道。

“从天主堂里出来会得到什么好处吗？不，我不是个天主教徒。我把自己称为新教教徒，我想这种自称可以是一种不会冒犯上帝的方式，婉转地说你不信任何东西……当修道院院长十年前来到这儿时，她还带着七个修女，现在只有三个了，其余的都死了。你瞧，即使在没有瘟疫的时候，湄潭府也不是什么健康的胜地。她们住在城镇的中心，在最贫困的地区，她们工作非常辛苦，从来没有假期。”

“现在只有修道院院长和三个修女了？”

“哦，不，有些人填补了她们的位置，现在她们有六个人了。当她们中的一个修女在瘟疫爆发之初就死于霍乱后，另外两个修女从广州过来帮忙了。”

凯蒂浑身颤抖了一下。

“你冷吗？”

“不冷，也就是打了个寒战[1]。”

“当她们离开法国后，就永远地离开了祖国。她们不像新教的传教士，时不时地可以有一年的假期。我总认为这是最难的。我们英国人对于土地没有那么强烈的依附感，我们能够在世界上的每个地区安家落户。但是法国人，我认为他们对自己的国家有着很强的依附感，甚至可以说是血肉相连。一旦离开自己的国家，他们就绝对没有真正地放松过。在我看来，这些女人做出这样的牺牲真是很感人，我想如果我是个天主教徒的话，这样的行为才会是十分自然的。”

凯蒂不动声色地看着他，她还不能十分理解这个小个儿男人说这话时的感情，她怀疑他是不是在故作姿态。他喝了那么多的威士忌，也许不是很清醒了。

“来吧，你亲眼看看。”他说道，带着嘲弄的微笑，很快就读出了她的心思，“几乎不会冒什么风险的。”

“如果你不害怕，我也没有理由害怕。”

“我认为它会让你觉得好玩的，那里就像一个微型的法国。”



* * *



[1]这句话的直译是“只是觉得有人走过了我的坟墓”。这是西方人迷信的说法，当你毫无来由地打寒战时，是因为“有人走过你的坟墓”。





第四十章


他们乘着一条小舢板过了河。码头上有一个轿椅已经为凯蒂备好，她被抬着上山，一直来到水闸处。在这儿，苦力们从河中取水，然后在肩上搭上轭，挑着巨大的水桶来来回回地运送着水，在堤道上溅满了水，把小土道弄得湿漉漉的，就像刚下过一场大雨似的。凯蒂的轿夫们口中发出短促、尖声的喊叫，催促他们让路。

“显而易见，所有的生意都停了下来。”威廷顿走在她的旁边，跟她说道，“在过去正常的情况下，这条路上满是肩挑背扛的苦力，上上下下地把货物运到船上去，你得奋力跟他们抢道才能过去。”

街道狭窄而弯曲，凯蒂完全失去了前进的方向感，很多店铺都关了门。在来湄潭府的一路上，她已经对街道的脏乱习以为常了。但这儿，好几个星期的垃圾已经堆积成山，恶臭熏天，她不得不把手绢捂在口鼻处。以前经过中国的城镇时，人群对她的注目而视让她不胜其烦，但现在她注意到不再有好奇的目光向她投来，路人不像通常那样摩肩接踵地行走，而是三三两两地散得很开，似乎只想埋头管自己的事情。他们如同惊弓之鸟，但又显得无精打采。当他们经过一座座房屋时，时不时会听见里面传来的敲锣声，还有某些不知名的乐器传来的刺耳而又悠长的哀怨曲调，在这些紧闭的门后，一定又有人死去了。

“我们到了。”威廷顿终于说道。

轿椅在一所院落的小门前被放了下来，门的上方是一个十字架，四周是长长的白色院墙。凯蒂从轿椅上走下来，威廷顿按响了门铃。

“你别以为这儿富丽堂皇，你知道，实际上她们非常寒酸。”

一个中国女孩打开了大门，威廷顿跟她说了几句话，她把他们引到走廊一侧的一间小屋子里面。屋里放着一张大桌子，上面盖着一个黑白格子相间的油布，墙的四周摆着一套硬木椅子，房间的一端是石膏做成的圣母玛利亚的雕像。没过多大一会儿，一位修女走了进来，个头矮胖，一张面孔很朴实，红色的脸颊，一双欢快的眼睛。威廷顿把凯蒂介绍给了她，而把她称为圣约瑟夫修女。

“这位是医生的太太吗？”[1]她笑容满面地用法语问道。然后又补充说，院长马上就会来见他们。

圣约瑟夫修女不会说英语，而凯蒂的法语也是磕磕绊绊。但是威廷顿用一口流利但绝非地道的法语，滔滔不绝地发表了一通滑稽的评论，引得本来就爱笑的圣约瑟夫修女捧腹大笑。她那欢快、轻松的笑声让凯蒂大吃一惊，她原以为教会人士总是很严肃的，而这种甜美、孩子般的快乐打动了她。



* * *



[1]原文为法语。





第四十一章


门开了，让凯蒂想象不到的是，门不是自然打开的，而是好像沿着门轴自己打开似的。修道院院长在门口站了片刻，然后走进了小房间，当她看到正在哈哈大笑的修女和威廷顿皱巴巴的、小丑一般的面孔，她的嘴角边也挂着矜持的笑容，然后向前走来，并向凯蒂伸出了手。

“费恩太太？”她用带着浓重口音，但发音很准的英语说道，说话的同时身子向前欠了欠，“我非常荣幸能够结识我们善良而又勇敢的医生的妻子。”

凯蒂觉得院长的眼睛上上下下地在她身上打量着，目光长久而又不避讳，直率但并不失礼，就好像一位妇女——她的专职工作就是对别人做出评判，对她来说，任何的花招和遮掩都是多余的。谦和中带着威严，她请客人落座，自己也坐了下来。圣约瑟夫修女不出声地笑着，站立在院长的旁边但略微靠后的位置。

“我知道你们英国人喜欢喝茶。”院长说道，“我已经叫人准备了，但是如果这个茶是以中国人的方式准备的，我得提前请您谅解。我知道威廷顿先生更喜欢喝威士忌，可我恐怕无法满足他的要求了。”

她微笑着，但在她严肃的眼里有一种调皮的神色。

“噢，得了吧，嬷嬷，你这样说好像我是个不折不扣的酒鬼似的。”

“我倒是希望你说你从不喝酒，威廷顿先生。”

“无论如何，我能说我不喝则罢，一喝就一醉方休。”

院长嬷嬷笑了起来，把这俏皮话翻译成法语给圣约瑟夫修女听。她用友善的目光注视着威廷顿。

“我们得体谅威廷顿先生，因为有那么两三次，我们一分钱也没有，正不知如何喂养孤儿的时候，威廷顿先生来了，救了我们的急。”

刚才给她们开了大门，并皈依了天主教的小女孩走了进来，手里拿着托盘，上面有很多中国式样的杯子、一个茶壶，还有一小盘叫作玛德琳娜的法国小点心。

“你一定得吃点儿玛德琳娜。”院长嬷嬷说道，“因为这是圣约瑟夫修女今天早上亲手为你做的。”

他们聊了会儿家常，院长嬷嬷问凯蒂来中国多长时间了，从香港过来的一路上是否把她累坏了，还问她是否去过法国，是否觉得香港的气候令人难以忍受。两个人聊的虽然都是一些琐碎的事，但是气氛很友好，与外面险恶的环境相比，有一种特殊的意味。客厅很安静，你几乎无法相信他们正身处人口稠密的城镇中心地带，一片平和安详笼罩着这片院落。然而，它的周围瘟疫正在肆虐，人们惊恐不安，四处奔逃，而跟土匪似的士兵盛气凌人地盘查着百姓。在这所修道院的院墙内，医院里挤满了病人和垂死的士兵，修女们领养的孤儿有四分之一已经死去了。

凯蒂搞不明白自己为什么会对这位严肃的院长嬷嬷产生很好的印象。她总是和蔼可亲地和凯蒂唠着家常。凯蒂观察着这位妇人，她穿着白色的衣服，唯一的色彩是在她的教袍胸口处印着的一颗红心。她是一位中年妇女，年龄大概四十岁或五十岁，不太可能说清楚，因为她光滑、苍白的脸上几乎没有什么皱纹，但又远远称不上年轻，主要从她举止的庄重、她的处变不惊和她强有力、美丽而又清瘦的双手上可以看出来。她的脸比较长，嘴也挺大，甚至牙齿也很突出，鼻子虽然不小，但很精致和灵敏，而她的双眼，在她细细的黑眉毛下，印衬出面孔的冷峻与悲悯，这双眸子很大，乌黑，虽然确切说不是很冷淡，但它们的沉稳给人一种威慑力。当你看到院长嬷嬷时，你第一个念头是嬷嬷年轻时一定是个美人，但过了一会儿，你会认识到她的美丽主要依赖于她的性格，随着岁月的流逝她愈发光彩照人。她的声音低沉、平稳，无论是说英语还是法语，都说得缓慢有力。但是，她身上最突出的特点就是天主教的慈悲所锻炼出来的威严，你能觉察出在她身上有种爱发号施令的习惯，别人顺从她的号令是很自然的，但是她在接受其他人的服从时，态度也很谦卑。你不会看不到她深刻地理解教会的权威性，正是这种权威支撑着她的威严。然而凯蒂有一种猜测，即使她有苦行僧般的态度，但她也有人类的脆弱，有对人类缺点的容忍。当她听威廷顿不加掩饰地满嘴跑火车时，始终面带庄重的微笑，对幽默显然具备十足的理解力。

在她身上还有一些别的品质，这是凯蒂隐隐约约能够感觉到的，但是就是无法明确地说出来。尽管院长嬷嬷很真诚，举手投足又很优雅，但凯蒂觉得自己像个笨手笨脚的中学生，有种要对她敬而远之的感觉。





第四十二章


“先生一点儿也没吃。”[1]圣约瑟夫修女说道。

“先生的口味被满族人的烹饪彻底毁了。”院长嬷嬷回答道。

圣约瑟夫修女的脸上笑容不见了，开始显得一本正经了。威廷顿很调皮地瞥了她一眼，又拿起一块小点心，一口吃了下去。凯蒂还有点儿摸不着头脑。

“为了证明您对我的评价是多么的不公正，嬷嬷，我将在晚餐时大吃一顿，把我面前的美味一扫而光。”

“如果费恩太太想参观修道院，我很乐意领她转转。”院长嬷嬷转身冲着凯蒂说道，脸上带着对威廷顿的话不以为然的微笑。“很遗憾，你会看到现在一切都是乱糟糟的，我们有太多的工作要做，而没有足够的修女。余上校坚持让我们的医院收治患病的士兵，所以我们不得不把餐厅改成了医院，用来收留孤儿。”

她站在门口让凯蒂和她一起进去，圣约瑟夫修女和威廷顿在后面跟着。他们沿着一个幽静的白色回廊走着，首先进入了一间空旷的大屋子，里面有很多中国女孩正在做着精美的刺绣，当参观者进来后，她们都站起身来，院长嬷嬷给凯蒂展示了一些刺绣样品。

“尽管有瘟疫，但我们的工作照常进行，这样还可以转移注意力，不受危险的干扰。”

他们又走进第二间屋子，屋子里更年幼一点儿的女孩们正在做简单的缝纫、卷边、缝针脚等。随后，他们进入了第三间屋子，这里只有一些很小的孩子，他们在一位中国教徒的照看下，大声嚷嚷地玩耍着，看到院长嬷嬷进来，他们就围在她身边。三三两两的小孩，个个是乌溜溜的黑眼珠和黑头发，有的抓着嬷嬷的手，有的在嬷嬷宽大的袍子下摆里玩捉迷藏。院长嬷嬷严肃的面孔上露出了迷人的微笑，她一边爱抚着他们，一边对他们说着逗笑的话，凯蒂虽然听不懂汉语，但也能明白都是些哄孩子的话。她受到了震动，孩子们穿着统一的服装，黄皮肤、发育不全的小身子、塌鼻梁，在她眼中几乎都不像人类，是令人厌恶的动物，但院长嬷嬷站在他们中间就像圣母本身，当她要离开这间屋子时，他们都不愿意让她走，紧紧地贴着她。所以，她一边笑着劝慰孩子们，一边不得不稍微用点儿劲让自己脱身。无论如何，在这个伟大的女士身上，他们一点儿也没有发现使他们害怕的东西，而只有善良和慈爱。

“当然，你知道，”当他们走到另外一个回廊时，她接着说道，“在某种意义上，他们只能说是弃儿，他们的父母不想要他们了，每个被带到这儿的孩子我们都会付一些现钞，否则的话，他们才不会费事把孩子送到这儿来，只是直接抛弃就行了。”她转过身去问圣约瑟夫修女，“今天又送来了几个？”

“四个。”

“现在瘟疫蔓延，他们就更加担心孩子会成为负担了，尤其是女孩。”

她领着凯蒂参观了宿舍，随后他们路过了一扇门，门上写着两个大字“医院”。凯蒂能够听到门后传来的痛苦的呻吟声、喊叫声，那声音简直就不像人类所发出的。

“我不打算领你参观医院了。”院长嬷嬷用平静的口吻说道，“没人希望看到那样的景象。”这时，一个念头突然冒了出来，“我想知道费恩大夫是否在里面。”

她用疑问的目光看着圣约瑟夫修女，而后者带着愉快的笑容，打开门溜了进去。当门打开后，凯蒂又往后缩了，因为里面传出的可怕的嘈杂声听得更真切了。这时，圣约瑟夫修女又出来了。

“没有，他不在，而且有事不再过来了。”

“六号病床的病人怎么样了？”

“可怜的孩子[2]，他死了。”

院长嬷嬷在胸前画着十字，嘴里快速而又喃喃地祷告着。

他们穿过了院落，凯蒂的目光落在了两个长长的东西上，这两个东西并排放在地面上，上面覆盖着一块蓝色的棉布。院长嬷嬷转身向威廷顿说道：“我们现在床铺很短缺，不得不把两个病人放在一张床上，如果一个病人死了，就必须赶紧抬走，为了给另一个病人腾地儿。”但是，她向凯蒂微微一笑。“现在我们领你去看一下我们的小教堂，我们很为此自豪呢，我们在法国的一位朋友前不久给我们送来了一座真人大小的圣母玛利亚的雕像。”

第四十三章


小教堂只不过是一个狭长低矮的房间，四周是白色石灰水粉刷过的墙壁，以及一排排的长条板凳。圣坛的尽头立着一个用熟石膏做成的圣像，涂绘着粗陋的色彩，很亮丽、崭新和俗艳。圣像的后面是一幅油画，画着耶稣被钉在十字架上受难的情景，两个玛利亚在十字架的下面，悲伤的神情很是夸张。这幅画画得很蹩脚，黑色的颜料糊在上面，显然作者对色彩的美学一无所知。墙的四周是同一作者所画的耶稣受难经过的画像[1]，也同样糟糕。这个小教堂看上去是那么的丑陋和粗俗。

修女们走进教堂，跪了下来默念祷告词，随后又站了起来。院长嬷嬷又一次和凯蒂聊起天来。

“当东西运到这儿的时候，每一件易碎的东西都碎了，只有我们眼前的这个雕像，它由我们在巴黎的捐助者所赠，丝毫没有损坏，这无疑是个奇迹。”

威廷顿古灵精怪的眼睛又闪亮了，但这次他没有说话。

“祭坛的装饰品和耶稣受难组像是我们的一个修女——圣安舍尔米姐妹画的。”院长嬷嬷在胸前画了一个十字，“她是个真正的艺术家，不幸的是，她也成了这场瘟疫的牺牲品。你不认为这些作品非常漂亮吗？”

凯蒂支吾了一下，勉强说了几句肯定的话。在祭坛上，有好几束纸花，烛台华丽的装饰让人分神。

“我们非常荣幸能在这儿分发圣餐。”

“是吗？”凯蒂说道，似乎不太理解。

“在可怕的灾难降临的时候，这对我们来说是莫大的安慰。”

他们离开了小教堂，又重新回到了他们一开始落座的客厅。

“在你离开之前，你愿意看看今天上午送来的婴儿吗？”

“非常乐意。”凯蒂说道。

院长嬷嬷领着他们来到走廊另一边的小房间里，在一张桌子上，有什么东西在一块布的下面奇怪地蠕动着。圣约瑟夫修女拿掉了那块布，四个非常小的、赤裸的婴儿露了出来，他们的身体发红，胳膊和腿儿在不安地乱动着，看上去很滑稽。他们古怪的小脸奇怪地揪揪着，好像在扮鬼脸。他们看上去都不像人类，而是一些未知物种的奇异动物，在人们的视线中诡异地动着。院长嬷嬷看着他们，嘴角上带着微笑，好像觉得很好玩。

“他们似乎活蹦乱跳的，有时他们被带来时都快死了。当然，他们一到，我们就给他们施洗礼。”

“这位女士的丈夫和这些孩子在一起一定会很开心。”圣约瑟夫修女说道，“我觉得他会按钟点来和这些婴儿玩的，他们哭的时候，他只能把他们抱起来，在他的臂弯中悠晃着，让他们觉得舒服，他们甚至会乐开了花。”

当凯蒂和威廷顿准备告辞来到门口的时候，凯蒂郑重地向院长嬷嬷表示感谢，对她造访所带来的麻烦表示歉意。嬷嬷鞠了一躬，但威严而又可亲的神态立即又恢复了。

“您的来访让我十分荣幸，您不知道您的丈夫对我们有多么的好，真是帮了我们大忙了。他是上帝派给我们的，我很高兴您陪他一起来了。他工作一天回到家里后，一定会感到极大的放松和宽慰，因为迎接他的有您的爱，还有您的——您的甜美的面庞。您一定要照顾好他，不要让他工作得太辛苦，您千万要替我们大家伙儿照顾好他呀。”

凯蒂的脸唰地红了，她一时不知说什么好。院长嬷嬷向她握手告别，凯蒂和她握手时，能够感觉到她冷静、睿智的目光落在自己身上，有一种冷静客观，同时又有某种看上去是对生活深刻理解的东西。

圣约瑟夫修女在他们身后关上了大门，凯蒂坐上了轿椅，他们通过狭窄、曲折的街道走上了返程的路。威廷顿偶尔闲聊几句，而凯蒂没有搭腔。他向轿椅看了看，但轿椅的窗帘已经拉下来了，他看不见她的表情，只好一声不吭地走着。但当他们到了河边时，她从轿椅中走了出来，让他吃惊的是，他看到她的眼里闪动着泪珠。

“怎么啦？”他问道，脸上的五官又挤成一团，露出惊愕的表情。

“没什么。”她努力地想笑一笑，“只是犯傻。”

第四十四章


凯蒂再一次一个人在客厅里坐着，这个肮脏的客厅原来是属于死去的传教士的。她躺在长椅上，面对着窗户，远眺河对面的庙宇（现在又接近傍晚，在天空的映衬下庙宇很可爱）。凯蒂在设法梳理清楚心中的感情，她没有想到这次对修道院的造访让她如此感动，她本来是出于好奇才去的，因为闲着没事。原先她想探究河对岸那座用石墙围起来的城镇，一直琢磨了好些天，可真的到过那儿之后，她一眼也不想再看到那些神秘的街道了。

但是，一旦进入了修道院，对她来说似乎到了另外一个超越时空的世界，那些没有什么家具的房间，冷峻简朴的白色走廊，好像拥有某种遥远和神奇的精神。那个小教堂，看上去是那么丑陋和粗俗，但在它粗陋的外表之下是悲天悯人之心，具有某种大教堂的富丽堂皇所不具备的东西。小教堂的花窗玻璃和图画都很寒酸，但其所传达的信仰使其变得肃穆庄严，传达出的博爱使其变得弥足珍贵，这些赋予了它内在的淡雅之美。在瘟疫流行的中心地带，修道院的工作在有条不紊地进行着，显示出面对危险的冷静和讲求实际的作风，几乎与严峻的现实形成了具有讽刺意味的对比，给凯蒂留下了深刻的印象。同时，凯蒂的耳中至今还回荡着圣约瑟夫修女打开医院大门的那一刻所传出来的鬼哭狼嚎般的声音。

更出人意料的是他们对沃尔特的评价，首先是圣约瑟夫修女，然后是院长嬷嬷，当她对他大加赞扬时，语气变得格外温柔。很奇怪，当凯蒂想到这儿时，竟让她觉得有些骄傲和激动——她们对沃尔特的评价如此之高。威廷顿也说了一些沃尔特正在做的事情，但那不仅仅是修女们所赞扬的能力（在香港时，她就已经知道大家都说他聪明），而且还有他的深思熟虑和温柔体贴。当然，他可以是非常温柔的，尤其是在你生病的时候，这种温柔能够达到极致。他非常聪明，不会动不动就生气，他的抚摸也能使人身心愉快，解愁忘忧，好像有某种神奇的魔力，似乎只要他站在你面前，就能缓解你的痛苦。她知道自己再也不能在他的目光中找到深情款款的爱意了，这曾经是她一度习以为常的神情，现在看到的只是恼怒。现在她知道了他巨大的爱的能力，用某种奇怪的方式，他现在把这种爱都倾注在了他所照顾的可怜的病人身上了，她并不感到妒忌，只有一种深深的失落感。就好像一种她虽然没有意识到，但早已习惯的支柱，被突然从她的身上抽走，使她变得头重脚轻，走路摇摇晃晃起来。

她曾经一度瞧不起沃尔特，现在她只感到自己瞧不起自己了。他一定知道她是怎样看待他的，而且接受了她对他的看法，没有感到丝毫的苦涩。她是个傻女人，他也知道这一点，但因为他爱她，所以对他来说没有任何影响。她现在不再恨他了，也不再有怨气了，有的只是害怕和困惑。她虽然不愿，但也不得不承认他有很多了不起的品质。有时，她认为在他身上甚至有种奇怪的和让人难以接近的伟大。匪夷所思的是过去她并不爱他，反而爱上了——现在仍然在爱着——一个毫无价值的男人，她此时越来越看清了这一点。经过了一遍又一遍的思索，在这段漫长的日子里，她准确地衡量了查理的价值，他是个再普通不过的男人，他身上的品质都是二流的，要是她能把对他的爱连根拔除就好了，这种爱仍然在她心中挥之不去！她努力让自己不去想他。

连威廷顿对沃尔特的评价都非常高，只有她自己对沃尔特的好视而不见，为什么会这样？因为他爱她，而她并不爱他。究竟是什么东西在人们的心中作怪，使你轻视一个爱你的人呢？但是，威廷顿坦承他并不喜欢沃尔特，男人们都不会喜欢。可很容易看出，那两个修女对沃尔特是由衷的欣赏和喜爱，在女人眼中他就不一样了，尽管你能感觉到他的羞涩，但同时你也能感受到他身上散发出的优雅成熟的气质。





第四十五章


毕竟正是这些修女深深地打动了她。圣约瑟夫修女那欢快的面孔和像苹果一样红扑扑的脸蛋在凯蒂的脑海中萦绕。圣约瑟夫修女是十年前最早一批跟随院长嬷嬷来到中国的人中的一个，她目睹了她的伙伴们一个接着一个地死去，疾病、食物的匮乏和对家乡的思念无时无刻不在撕扯着她们，然而，她依然保持着幸福和欢乐，究竟是什么东西给了她天真和快乐的力量？还有院长嬷嬷，凯蒂想象自己再次站在她的面前，又一次感受到了自己的谦卑和羞愧。虽然院长嬷嬷穿着简朴，没有任何装饰，但她身上有种天生的威严，使人心生敬畏，你无法想象能有人不尊重她。圣约瑟夫修女在院长嬷嬷身边站着，每一个小的手势以及回答中的语调，无一不显示出她对院长嬷嬷深深的折服。而威廷顿虽然轻率和莽撞，但从他说话的口吻中可以看出在嬷嬷面前他已经大为收敛了。凯蒂觉得完全没有必要告诉她院长嬷嬷出身于法国的一个显赫家族，因为在嬷嬷的举手投足中就透着贵族气质，她身上有种不怒自威之气，别人可能不知道它从何而来，但不得不臣服。她既有一个伟大女士的谦逊，又有作为圣徒的谦卑，在她坚定、美丽和饱受岁月摧残的脸上，简朴的修行焕发出热情的光彩。同时，她心中对芸芸众生的牵挂和温柔仁慈才能让那些小孩子叽叽喳喳但毫不害怕地围绕在她身旁，因为在她对他们深深的爱的笼罩下，他们能得到保护和安慰。她看着那四个新生的婴儿时，脸上露出甜蜜的微笑，也带着深深的感情，就像一缕阳光照在了旷野中疯长而孤独的石楠上。圣约瑟夫修女无意中说的那些有关沃尔特的话也让凯蒂感到了莫名的感动，她知道沃尔特急切地想让她生个孩子，虽然沃尔特平时寡言少语，但她从不怀疑他能够整天逗孩子玩，放下大人的身段，展示他孩童的本性，而现在大多数的男人带孩子时总是笨手笨脚，沃尔特是个多么奇怪的人啊！

但是，所有感人的体验总有一种阴影（就像银白色的云朵镶着黑衬）挥之不去，让她觉得不安。在圣约瑟夫修女单纯的欢快，更多的是在院长嬷嬷优雅的彬彬有礼中，凯蒂感觉到和她们之间还是有距离的。修女们是很友好，甚至可以说是真诚，但与此同时她们也有所保留，她不知道究竟是什么，她隐约感觉到自己只不过是个普通的陌生人，她与修女们之间有一重障碍在隔着她们，她们说着不同的语言，不仅仅是意思上的交流，而更多的是心灵的沟通。当她身后的大门关上的时候，她觉得自己已经被她们完全忘到了脑后，又一刻不停地去忙她们刚才被耽误的工作去了，对于她们来说，她好像根本不存在。她觉得自己不仅被那所贫困的小修道院关在了门外，而且被某个她全身心渴求的、神秘的精神花园关在了外面。她感到了一种以前从未感受到过的孤独，这就是她又哭起来的原因。

这会儿，她疲倦地把头往后一靠，叹息道：“噢，我真没用。”





第四十六章


那天傍晚，沃尔特比以往略微早了一些回到了他们住的平房。凯蒂正躺在长椅上，而长椅又对着敞开的窗户。天快黑了。

“屋里怎么没灯？”他问道。

“晚饭准备好了，他们会把灯拿来的。”

他总是跟她很随便地聊些琐碎的事，好像他们是关系不错的朋友，他的神态上没有一丝迹象表明他还记恨在心。他绝不跟她对视，也从不微笑。他小心翼翼地保持着礼貌。

“沃尔特，如果我们幸免于这场瘟疫，你觉得我们以后应当怎么办？”她问道。

在回答之前，他停顿了一会儿，她看不见他的脸。

“我还没想过。”

在往昔的时光里，她想到什么开口就说，是绝不会在说之前考虑再三的，但是现在她有点儿怕他，她觉得自己的嘴唇在颤抖，胸口在撕心裂肺般地疼痛。

“今天下午我去了修道院。”

“我听说了。”

即使说不成完整的句子，她还是强迫自己说下去。

“你把我带到这儿，是真的想让我死吗？”

“如果我是你，我会适可而止的，凯蒂。我觉得没完没了地谈论我们本该忘记的事，这种念头可不怎么好。”

“但是你并没有忘记，我也没有忘记。自从来到这儿以后，我想了很多，你真的不想听听我的心里话吗？”

“当然愿意，我洗耳恭听。”

“我确实对不住你，我对你不忠。”

他愣愣地站着，一动不动，样子有点儿吓人。

“我不知道你是否会理解我的意思，当这种事结束的时候，对女人来说算不了什么，我认为女人绝不会理解男人们所采取的态度。”她突然用一种她自己都几乎认不出的声音说道，“你知道查理是个什么样的人，也知道他下一步会怎么做。好吧，你是对的，他是个无赖，我觉得要不是我也跟他臭味相投，也不会被他轻易上手的。我不是在请求你的原谅，也不是请求你能像以前那样爱我，可是我们不能成为朋友吗？在我们身边，每天都有成千上万的人死去，还有那些在修道院里的修女……”

“她们和这事有什么关系？”他打断了她的话。

“我也解释不清楚，今天去了那里以后，我有种奇怪的感觉，它似乎意味着很多东西。瘟疫是如此可怕，而她们自我牺牲的精神是那么让人敬佩。我禁不住觉得我俩之间的事是那么荒唐和不足挂齿。如果你能明白我的意思，请你不要因为一个愚蠢的女人曾经对你不忠而闷闷不乐吧，我对你来说，一无是处和微不足道，不值得让你为我费那么多心思。”

他没有回答，但也没有挪步，似乎在等她继续说下去。

“威廷顿先生和修女们已经跟我讲了很多你做的事情，都那么了不起。我很为你骄傲，沃尔特。”

“你过去可不是这样，以前你总是瞧不起我，现在怎么变了？”

“你难道看不出来我既怕你又担心你吗？”

他又一次沉默了。

“我不明白。”他最后说道，“我不知道你想要什么？”

“我自己什么都不想要，我只想要你不要那么不开心。”

她能感觉到他僵住了。当他开口时，声音又变得很冰冷。

“你要是觉得我不开心，那你就想错了，我有太多的事情要做，没有工夫琢磨你。”

“我想知道修女们愿不愿意让我去修道院帮忙，她们的人手很缺。如果我能帮上一点儿忙的话，我应该感谢她们给我提供机会。”

“那可不是一件轻松的活或者令人愉快的工作，我怀疑你能坚持多久。”

“你在鄙视我，对吗，沃尔特？”

“不对。”他犹豫了一下，声音变得怪怪的，“我在鄙视我自己。”





第四十七章


晚饭后，沃尔特跟往常一样坐在灯下看书，他每天晚上都要读会儿书直到凯蒂上床睡觉才把书放下。然后他会走进实验室，这个实验室是他在平房的一间空屋子里自己搭建起来的。在那儿，他要工作到深夜。他的睡眠很少，整天忙于实验，她根本不知道这些实验是干什么的，他也从来不跟她谈他的工作，甚至在以前的日子里，他对自己的工作也闭口不谈，在本性上，他也不是个张扬的人。她认真地思索了他刚才跟她说的那些话，从两个人的对话中，她还是理不出头绪，她对他了解得太少，无法确定他的话是否真的是内心的想法。该不会是这样的情况吧，他现在对她来说是无处不在，而相反，对他来说，她在他眼中已经完全不存在了呢？她过去跟他聊天，能让他兴致勃勃地听着，是因为他爱她，而如今他已经不再爱她，她的话可能只会让他觉得烦扰。这让她觉得很屈辱。

她看着他，灯光映照着他的侧影，好像一座浮雕，端正的五官轮廓非常清晰，但脸上的表情不仅仅是严肃，甚至可以说是严厉。他纹丝不动，只有在细读每一页时，眼睛才会在动。他甚至让人觉得可怕，可谁又能想到就是这张冰冷的面孔会被感情所融化，露出充满柔情的神色呢？她知道这一点，心里由于厌恶哆嗦了一下。真是奇怪，他长相英俊，而且诚实可靠和睿智，可过去她就是不爱他，每当想到自己永远不用再忍受他的爱抚了，反而让她如释重负。

她询问沃尔特强迫她来这危险之地，是不是真的想借刀杀人，他并没回答。这反倒增加了事情的神秘感，她既迫切地想解开谜团，又对真相十分恐惧。他确实与众不同，但如果真有这样邪恶的想法，也太不可思议了。他一定是想用这种方式吓唬她，并向查理进行报复（这正符合他讽刺性幽默的性格），后来出于固执，或者害怕被人当作傻瓜耻笑，才不肯松口，坚持让她承受这一切。

是的，他说鄙视自己，这么说是什么意思呢？凯蒂又一次看了看他安静而严肃的脸庞，可好像她根本不在屋子里一样，他没有理会她。

“你为什么会鄙视你自己？”她问道，几乎是脱口而出，好像正在继续早些时候的对话，中间没有任何的停顿一样。

他放下书，若有所思地观察着她。然后，他似乎从遥远的地方神游回来，定了定神，说道：

“因为我爱你。”

她的脸红了，把脸扭过了一边，因为她无法忍受他冷淡、平稳和审视的目光，她终于明白他的意思了。过了一会儿，她才回答。

“我觉得你这样对我太不公正了。”她说，“因为我的愚蠢、草率和粗俗而责怪我，这不公正。我从小就是在这样的环境中被培养长大的，我所认识的女孩子也都是这样……就像责怪某个没有音乐细胞的人，就仅仅因为她对一场交响音乐会感到枯燥乏味。你以为我会有某些品质，而实际上我没有，你就责怪我，这公平吗？我从来没有企图欺骗你，假装自己十全十美，而实际上我根本不是你期望的那样。我只是人长得还不算差，有些虚荣，追求快乐。你当然不会去市场上小商小贩那里买珍珠项链和黑貂皮大衣，要买锡制的喇叭和玩具气球时你才会去那儿。”

“我没有责怪你。”

他的声音显得有些疲倦，她开始觉得他可能有点儿不耐烦了。突然之间，以前的困惑现在变得明确起来。为什么他不能认识到他们之间的事是多么的微不足道，因为他们每天都笼罩在死亡的恐怖阴影之下，而另一方面，大自然是那么壮丽，人性是那么壮美，都那么令人敬畏，两者她都曾见识过。一个蠢女人红杏出墙真的就那么罪不可赦吗？为什么她的丈夫面对着庄严崇高的自然与人性之美，还是那么的在乎？沃尔特是那么的睿智，可就在这一点上那么想不明白，真是咄咄怪事。可能是他已经把一个洋娃娃套上了华丽的衣装，将其放置在圣殿中加以膜拜，随即却发现这个洋娃娃的肚子里装满了稻草，于是他既不能原谅这个洋娃娃，也不能原谅他自己。他的灵魂被撕裂了，恰恰人为制造出来的信仰是他的精神支柱，当真相水落石出后，他的梦想也就破灭了。现在她看明白了，他不能原谅她的原因在于他无法原谅自己。

她觉得听到了他轻轻地叹了一口气，便迅速地瞥了他一眼。一个念头突然出现在脑海里，让她倒吸了一口凉气，差一点儿叫出声来。

他现在所遭受的，难道就是人们所说的——心如死灰？





第四十八章


第二天一整天凯蒂的脑子里都在想着上次去修道院的经过。一大早，沃尔特前脚刚走，凯蒂后脚就带着一个女仆坐上了轿椅，计划到河对岸去。天刚蒙蒙亮，渡船上已经挤满了中国人，有些是穿着蓝色布衣打扮的农民，还有一些是穿着体面的黑长袍的有钱人，但个个表情古怪，好像这趟船要把他们送到阴曹地府去一般。当船靠到岸边的时候，他们站在码头愣了一会儿，似乎不十分清楚往哪个方向去，然后三三两两、无精打采地向山上走去。

这个时候，城镇的街道还一片空寂，所以看上去像一座死城。偶尔有几个路人呆呆地走过，如同孤魂野鬼一般。天空没有云彩，旭日洒下天堂般暖暖的阳光。难以想象，在这个无忧无虑、充满新鲜空气和欢乐气息的清晨，城镇像一个人的喉咙被疯子的一双手紧紧掐着，躺在那里大口喘气，生命正一点点儿地消失。确实，这座城镇现在难逃瘟疫的魔爪，而大自然（湛蓝的天空，清澈透明得如同孩童的心灵）目睹人们在痛苦中翻滚，在恐惧中一步步走向死亡，竟然无动于衷，真是不可思议。轿椅在修道院的门前放了下来，这时一名乞丐忙从地上站了起来，向凯蒂乞求施舍。他穿着完全看不出颜色与形状的破麻袋片似的衣服，好像是刚从垃圾堆里淘出来的。透过衣服上破了的大洞，能看见他皮肤坚硬粗糙，晒得就像是山羊皮，两条光着的腿瘦得像麻秆，乱蓬蓬的头发满是灰尘，脏兮兮的（脸颊塌陷下去，深凹的双眼放着野性的光），像个疯子一样。凯蒂被吓坏了，赶紧躲过了身子，轿夫们用粗哑的嗓子大声呵斥他走开，可他仍然纠缠不休，为了摆脱他，凯蒂用发抖的手扔给了他一些零钱。

修道院的大门开了，凯蒂的女仆上前解释她的女主人希望面见院长嬷嬷。她又一次被领进了那间密不透风的客厅，那里的窗户似乎从来没有打开过。在客厅里，凯蒂坐着等了很长时间，心里开始嘀咕口信是不是没有带到。最后，院长嬷嬷终于出现了。

“让你久等了，真是不好意思。”她说道，“我没想到你会来，又不巧被别的事情绊住了。”

“请原谅我打扰您，我恐怕来得不是时候。”

院长嬷嬷冲她笑了笑，笑容虽然不是很灿烂，但也还算甜美，她请凯蒂坐下。然而，凯蒂注意到她的双眼红肿，显然一直在哭。凯蒂吃了一惊，因为院长嬷嬷给她的印象是一个不受世俗干扰，不会轻易动感情的女人。

“是不是出了什么事？”她有些迟疑地问道，“您想让我离开吗？我可以换个时间再来。”

“不用，不用，告诉我能为您做点儿什么，只是——只是我们的一位修女昨晚去世了。”她的声音失去了平稳的语调，眼中又涌满了泪水，“我悲伤其实是不对的，她是个圣徒，我知道她善良和纯朴的灵魂已经直接飞进了天堂。但是一个人的弱点总是很难控制住，恐怕我也不能永远保持理性。”

“听您这么说，我真的替您难过。”凯蒂说道。

嬷嬷固有的悲天悯人之情再次让她的声音哽咽。

“她是十年前和我一起从法国来这儿的姐妹，现在我们只剩下三个姐妹了。我至今还记得，我们一小群人站在轮船的尽头（你们把它叫什么，船头吗？），当船驶出马赛港的时候，我们看到了圣母玛利亚闪着金光的雕像，我们一起祷告着。自从我入教以来，能够被派到中国一直是我最大的愿望，但是当我看到岸上的土地渐渐离我远去的时候，还是情不自禁地哭了。我是这群姐妹中带队的，我知道自己没有给她们树立一个好榜样。那时，圣弗朗西斯·夏维尔修女——这是昨天晚上死去的修女的名字——拉着我的手，告诉我不要难过，无论我们去哪里，她说，法国和上帝永远伴随着我们。”

嬷嬷那张严肃、美丽的脸庞因为悲痛扭曲了，人性使她痛苦万分，而她的理性和信仰又迫使她要努力控制住自己的泪水。凯蒂扭过头去，她觉得自己无心中窥见了嬷嬷内心的挣扎与冲突是件尴尬的事。

“我刚才一直在给她的父亲写信，她和我一样，是独生女，她的父母在布列塔尼靠打鱼为生，听到这个消息对他们是多么大的打击呀。噢，这场可怕的瘟疫什么时候能结束？今天上午我们这里又有两个女孩子染上了霍乱，除非奇迹发生，她们才有可能获救，这些中国人没有什么抵抗力。圣弗朗西斯修女的去世是个重大损失，这里又有那么多的工作要做，可现在的人手变得更少了。我们还有一些姐妹在中国其他地方的修道院里，她们都急切地想过来帮忙。我们所有的神职人员都是如此，我觉得，他们会倾其所有（当然，他们实际上一无所有）来这儿，但到了这儿注定会回不去的。只要我们现有的姐妹能够忙得过来，我不愿意其他人去做无谓的牺牲。”

“您的话鼓舞了我，嬷嬷。”凯蒂说道，“我一直觉得我在一个不幸的时候来到了这儿。您那天说这儿有太多的工作要做，修女们忙不过来。我想知道您是否能允许我过来给她们帮忙，只要能搭把手，我不在乎干什么，哪怕您派给我擦地板的活儿，我都感激不尽。”

院长嬷嬷笑了笑，似乎觉得凯蒂的话很有趣，看到她的情绪很轻易地就改变了，凯蒂还是有些吃惊。

“没必要擦地板，那种活儿可以让孤儿们干。”她停顿了一下，很和善地看着凯蒂，“我亲爱的孩子，难道你不认为你能陪自己的丈夫一起来这个地方已经做得够多的了吗？很多人的妻子是不会有勇气这样做的。除此之外，你丈夫结束一天的工作回到家里，你能给他温暖、舒适和宁静的港湾让他休息，除此以外，没有什么比这更重要的了，对吗？相信我，他需要你全身心的爱和所有的体贴照顾。”

凯蒂无法轻松地与嬷嬷对视，后者正在用一种超然的审视和半开玩笑的好意注视着她。

“我从早到晚没什么事可做。”凯蒂说道，“我觉得这里有这么多的事情要做，我不能忍受自己可以整天吃闲饭，不想让自己成为一个废物。我知道自己没有权利要求您好心地同意我的请求，或者占用您过多的时间缠着您，但我想再解释一下我说的话。如果您能同意我过来帮忙的话，实际上您是在为我做一件好事。”

“你看上去身体可不怎么好，你前天大驾光临来看我们的时候，我觉得你的脸色好像很苍白，圣约瑟夫修女认为你可能怀孕了。”

“没有，没有。”凯蒂喊了起来，脸一下子红到了耳根。

院长嬷嬷发出了一阵清脆的笑声。

“没什么可害臊的，我亲爱的孩子，这种猜测也不是不可能，你结婚多久了？”

“我脸色很苍白是因为天生肤色就白，但我的身体很好，我向您保证我不怕干活。”

此时，嬷嬷又恢复了院长的威严，无意之间又流露出了早习以为常的拍板做主的神态。她上下打量着凯蒂，让凯蒂立刻觉得有种说不出来的紧张。

“您会说中文吗？”

“恐怕不会。”凯蒂答道。

“嗯，有点儿可惜，我本来是想让你管理那些岁数大一些的女孩子的。现在那边很困难，我担心她们会——你们怎么说来着？缺人手吗？”她以一种想找到合适词汇的口吻下了结论。

“我不能帮助姐妹们照料病人吗？我一点儿也不怕霍乱，我可以护理生病的女孩子或者士兵。”

院长嬷嬷的笑容从脸上消失了，用一种沉思的目光看着凯蒂的脸，然后摇了摇头。

“你还不了解霍乱到底是一种什么病，它是非常可怕的，医院的工作士兵们可以完成，我们只派了一位姐妹去督导，至于说到女孩子们……不行，不行，我敢肯定你丈夫不会同意让你做这事的，那真的是一个可怕和让人难以面对的景象。”

“我会慢慢适应的。”

“不行，这行不通。这是我们的事情，只有我们才有责任做这种工作，你没有义务去做。”

“您让我觉得自己好没用，什么忙也帮不上，如果说这儿没有我能干的事，好像不太可能吧。”

“你跟你丈夫说起过这个想法吗？”

“说过。”

院长嬷嬷盯着她，好像要看透她心头的秘密似的，可当她看到凯蒂焦急而又充满期待的目光时，她笑了。

“显然你是个新教教徒吧？”她问道。

“是的。”

“没关系，魏特森医生，那位前不久去世的传教士，也是个新教教徒，也没什么影响。在我们眼中，他是个大好人，我们对他怀有深深的谢意，觉得欠了他很多。”

这时凯蒂的脸上闪过一丝微笑，但没有吭声。院长嬷嬷似乎下了决心，她站起身来。

“你真是太好了，我认为可以为你找点儿事情做。现在事实上死神已经把圣弗朗西斯修女从我们身边夺走了，我们要应付这么多工作也不太可能了，你准备什么时间开始工作？”

“现在就可以。”

“那太好了，[1]我很高兴听你这么说。”

“我向您保证我会竭尽全力的。非常感谢您给我的这个机会。”

院长嬷嬷打开了客厅的门，但是刚要出去的时候又犹豫了。她再次用探询和睿智的目光看了凯蒂大半天，然后把手轻轻地放在她的手臂上。

“要知道，我亲爱的孩子，一个人是无法在工作或欢愉中找到安宁的，无论是在俗世，还是在修道院，它只存在于自己的灵魂深处。”

凯蒂一激灵，可她还没缓过神来，院长嬷嬷就很快地从她身边走过，出了房门。

第四十九章


凯蒂发现工作像一服清醒剂，让她的精神焕发。她每天清晨太阳升起后不久就匆匆赶往修道院，直到西边的太阳把狭窄的河流和河面上拥挤的小船染成金黄色才回到家中。院长嬷嬷安排她照料一些年龄较小的孩子。凯蒂的母亲在她小时候就从家乡利物浦把她带到了伦敦，比较早地培养了她具有讲求实际的家庭主妇的意识，而凯蒂虽然平日里有些随随便便，但她用打趣的口吻说，自己还是具备了作为一名好的家庭主妇的天赋。她做的饭很好吃，针线活也做得漂亮，当她显露出这方面的本事后，就被派去管理更年轻一些的女孩子们的缝纫工作，这些女孩子懂一点儿法语，而每天她都学几句中国话，所以管理起来倒不是太费劲。在其他的时间里，她还得照看年龄更小的孩子，让她们不要调皮捣蛋，还得给她们穿脱衣服，到了睡觉的时间，让她们老实睡觉。孩子人数很多，也有专门的保姆帮着照看，但是凯蒂需要留意一下她们的工作。所有的工作都不是太重要，她本来更愿意做一些更艰巨的工作，但是院长嬷嬷没有同意她的请求，加之凯蒂对她很敬畏，也就没有再三要求。

在开始的几天里，她不得不努力调整自己，克服对这些小姑娘多多少少的厌恶之情。小姑娘们穿着难看的制服，梳着黑色的朝天辫，长着黄色的圆脸和乌黑明亮的眼睛。凯蒂还清楚地记得，第一次来修道院时，四周站满了这些小丑八怪，院长嬷嬷的面孔变得柔和而美丽。可凯蒂本能上对这些孩子还是有些排斥。现在，她得双手抱着一两个小孩，而这些孩子因为跌了一跤，或者磕掉了牙齿正在大哭。凯蒂发现用一两句哄小孩的话就能起作用，虽然孩子们听不懂她在说什么，但能感觉到她紧抱着自己的力量，或者她用温柔的脸颊紧贴着那些哭泣着的小黄脸，孩子们能够感受到抚慰，也就不哭了。对凯蒂渐渐熟悉起来以后，小孩子们对她不再感到陌生和害怕，纷纷跑过来和她玩耍，由于她赢得了他们的信任，这也给了凯蒂某种特别的幸福感。年龄更大一些的女孩子对凯蒂也同样如此，凯蒂教她们缝纫，这些女孩子欢快的笑声、聪明的表现，以及当凯蒂表扬她们几句时，她们的兴高采烈劲儿，都让凯蒂深深地感动，她觉出了她们喜欢自己。于是，既为自己得到她们的喜欢而有些沾沾自喜，也为自己的行为感到骄傲，凯蒂也开始喜欢她们了。

然而，有一个孩子却始终不能让她适应。她是一个六岁的小女孩，但是个痴呆儿。硕大的患有脑积水的头不堪重负地在她瘦小的身体上晃动，长着一双大而无神的眼睛，嘴角不断地流着口水，时不时地还用沙哑的嗓音嘟囔着谁也听不清的话语。她既让人恶心，又让人害怕。不知什么原因，这个智障的孩子对凯蒂有着某种依恋。凯蒂在大房子里走到哪里，她便跟到哪里，还紧紧地贴着凯蒂的裙摆，在凯蒂的膝盖上蹭她的脸，不断地要抚摸凯蒂的手。凯蒂因为厌恶而浑身发抖，她知道这个孩子渴望爱抚，但她打心眼儿里不愿意去触碰她。

有一次，她和圣约瑟夫修女谈到了这个智障女孩，凯蒂感慨地说这孩子真不应该活在这个世界上。圣约瑟夫修女面带笑容，伸出了她的手去抚摸这个畸形儿。这个智障孩子用她凸出的前额反复地摩挲修女的手。

“可怜的小家伙。”修女说道，“她被人带到这儿时都奄奄一息了。上帝保佑，她来时我正好在大门口，我想她应该还有一口气，所以我马上给她施了洗礼。你想象不到，为了救活她，我们费了多大的劲儿，有那么三四次我们都以为她那个小灵魂已经逃到了天堂。”

凯蒂不再说话，圣约瑟夫修女又滔滔不绝地开始聊起别的事情了。而第二天，当这名智障孩子接近凯蒂并摸她的手时，凯蒂控制住自己的情绪，用手去抚摸这孩子光秃秃的大脑门，并强挤出笑容。但是，突然这个孩子的行为有些反常，她从凯蒂身边走开了，好像对她失去了兴趣。那一整天，包括接下来的好几天，她对凯蒂都带搭不理，凯蒂有点儿不知道自己做错了什么，想用笑容和手势哄她过来，但是这个孩子扭过头去，假装没看见她。





第五十章


因为修女们从早到晚忙着数不清的工作，除了在那座空荡、寒酸的小教堂里做礼拜的时候，凯蒂很少能见到她们。她第一天去小教堂，院长嬷嬷看到她坐在女孩子们后面，这些孩子是按照年龄的大小被安排在小教堂的长条凳子上的。院长嬷嬷停下脚步，走过来跟凯蒂说道：

“我们必须来这所教堂时，你千万别认为自己也必须来。”她接着说，“你是一名新教教徒，你有自己的信仰。”

“但是我愿意来，嬷嬷。我发现来这儿能让我休息和放松。”

院长嬷嬷看了她一眼，稍微俯身凑近了她。

“当然，你完全可以按照自己的选择去做，我是想让你明白，你没有责任和义务一定要去做什么。”

凯蒂很快又遇见了圣约瑟夫修女，两人虽然谈不上有多亲密，但可以说彼此很熟悉了。整个修道院的财政大权都掌握在圣约瑟夫修女手上，她经常因为要料理一大家子人的日常花销而忙得团团转。她自称在虔诚祷告时才能休息片刻。然而，能让她开心的是，到了傍晚，当凯蒂和那些刚收工的女孩子一起来到教堂，她可以走上前来。圣约瑟夫修女发誓说她累坏了，但没有时间休息，这样她可以有理由坐下来休息几分钟，和凯蒂聊会儿天。她在院长嬷嬷不在跟前的时候总是很健谈，充满快乐，喜欢开玩笑，还热衷于聊点儿小道消息。凯蒂喜欢她天不怕、地不怕的性格，可以说对她的喜欢超过了对她的敬畏。而圣约瑟夫修女的兴趣爱好也不会妨碍她成为一个本性善良而平凡的女人。凯蒂和她高兴地聊着天，不介意向修女承认自己的法语讲得有多差，两人经常对凯蒂语言上犯的错误哈哈大笑。圣约瑟夫修女每天教凯蒂一些有用的中文词汇。她是农民的女儿，所以在内心深处，她还是一个纯朴的农民。

“我小时候常常去放牛，”她说道，“就像圣女贞德一样。但是我不够圣洁，还不能在幻觉中看到美景。我想这也是不幸之中的万幸，如果我真看到了幻景，我父亲肯定会用鞭子抽我的，他过去常常打我，这个老家伙。我是个非常淘气的小姑娘，有时候回想起当初的恶作剧，还觉得不好意思哩。”凯蒂一想到这个胖胖的、已到中年的修女曾经是一个任性的孩子，就忍俊不禁。哪怕到了现在，她性格中还有些孩子气，常常能够感染你。她身上似乎有着秋天乡下的香气，也就是当苹果树结满果实，庄稼被收割装满谷仓时所散发出的乡土气息。她没有院长嬷嬷性情中的那种圣徒般的悲悯与苦修，但有一种朴素和幸福的乐观。

“你从未想到过返回故乡吗，我的姐妹？”凯蒂问道。

“哦，没有。回家太难了。再说我热爱这儿，我从来没有像在孤儿们中间那么开心过。他们是那么的善良，每个人都有一颗感恩的心。成为一名修女（我们一直虔诚地信奉宗教），我觉得挺好的，就像一个人有养育她的母亲，她不能忘记是吸吮她的乳汁长大的一样。我母亲的年纪很大了，恐怕我们无法再见面了。我心里也很难过。但她和儿媳妇相处得很好，我的弟弟对她也很孝顺，我的侄子现在也长大了，我想他们很高兴农庄里又多了一个帮手，我离开法国时，他还是个孩子，可他答应我会快快长大，好有足够的力气干农活。”

听着圣约瑟夫修女聊着家常，你几乎不可能意识到，在这个安静屋子的四面墙壁之外，有可怕的霍乱正在肆虐。在凯蒂看来，圣约瑟夫修女就对它毫不在意。

圣约瑟夫修女对这个世界和它的居民有着天真的好奇心，她问凯蒂关于英国和伦敦的各种各样的问题，她认为英国整天大雾弥漫，甚至在大白天都伸手不见五指。她想知道凯蒂是否经常去舞会，是否住在一所大房子里，有多少个兄弟姐妹。她还经常谈到沃尔特。院长嬷嬷说他人太好了，每天她们都会为他祈祷。凯蒂能有这么一个善良、勇敢、充满智慧的丈夫是多么的幸运！





第五十一章


但是，最终圣约瑟夫修女的话题还是会回到院长嬷嬷身上。凯蒂从一开始就意识到，嬷嬷在修道院绝对是个核心人物，毫无疑问，她不仅受到修道院所有人员的爱戴和崇拜，而且大家对她还有些敬畏，但不是害怕。尽管凯蒂自己也能感受到她的好意，但在她面前，凯蒂觉得自己好像一个中学生站在校长的面前，往往会局促不安，因为她心中充满一种奇怪的感情——崇敬，甚至让她觉得有些难为情。圣约瑟夫修女用一种给人感觉很天真的口气，急切地告诉凯蒂院长嬷嬷出身多么高贵，她的祖先在历史上曾经有很重要的地位，她和欧洲一半的君主有着或多或少的亲戚关系，西班牙的阿方索国王在她父亲的领地上打过猎，她家在法国各个地方都有庄园，要是一般人，很难放弃这样富贵的生活。凯蒂笑眯眯地听着，但对她的话并没留下什么印象。

“另外，[1]你只需看她的样子，”圣约瑟夫修女说道，“只需看一眼，你就能感觉到，你就能知道她的家庭有多显赫。[2]”

“她有一双我所见过的最美丽的手。”凯蒂说道。

“啊，但是你如果知道她是怎么用这双手的，你就不会这么说了。她什么样的脏活、累活都干过，我们亲爱的嬷嬷。[3]”

刚到这座城镇时，这儿一无所有，她们自己动手修建了修道院。院长嬷嬷制定建设方案，并亲自监督工程。从她们到的那一刻起，她们就开始从育婴堂和接生婆残酷的手上挽救那些被抛弃的贫苦女婴。开始时她们没有床铺可以睡觉，窗户上也没有玻璃来抵挡夜晚的寒风（“再没有，”圣约瑟夫修女说道，“比这儿更脏的地方了。”）。她们经常入不敷出，不仅付不起建筑工人的工资，而且连简单的食品都买不起。她们那时的生活就像是一群农民，她是怎么说的？法国的农民，不对，那些为她父亲工作的人，他们都会把这些修女吃的东西扔给猪当食物。那个时候，院长嬷嬷把修女们召集到她的周围，一起跪地祈祷，祈祷圣母玛利亚能给她们送些钱来。就在她们跪地祈祷的时候，有人邮寄过来一千法郎，或者某个陌生人，一个英国人（可能是一名新教教徒，如果你愿意这样想的话），甚至是个中国人来敲门，给她们带来礼物。一旦她们陷入困境，所有的人都会向圣母玛利亚发誓，如果她能施以援手，她们一定会纪念她而背诵九日经[4]，你会相信吗？爱逗笑的威廷顿先生在第二天过来看我们，说我们看上去好像都想大吃一顿了，所以给我们留下了一百美元。

他是个多么滑稽的小个儿男人呀，光头，精明的小眼睛（一双聪明的小眼睛[5]），喜欢开玩笑。我的上帝呀，看他把法语给糟蹋的，你忍不住要嘲笑他，而他一点儿也不生气。虽然身处可怕的瘟疫重灾区，但他表现得好像是来这儿度假一样。他性情像法国人一样浪漫，又很聪明，除了口音以外，你很难相信他是英国人。但是，有时圣约瑟夫修女认为，他故意把法语说得乱七八糟就是为了让你发笑。当然，他的品行不是所有人都认同的，但那是他自己的事（修女说这话时，叹了口气，耸了耸肩，又摇了摇头），他还是个单身汉，岁数也并不大。

“他的品行怎么了，我的姐妹？”凯蒂笑着问道。

“你真的不知道？那我不该跟你说这些的，跟你说这些闲话真是罪过。他在和一个中国女人同居，确切地说，是个满族女人，好像还是一个格格，她爱他到了发狂的程度。”

“听上去不太可能呀。”凯蒂喊出了声。

“没有什么不可能，我向你保证，每件事差不多都是真的，他可缺德了，远不止这些呢。你还记得第一次来修道院的时候，他不想吃我特意做的玛德琳娜蛋糕，嬷嬷说他的胃被满族的烹调给搞乱了的事吗？她就是指的这件事，你应该看到了他的抵触情绪。说起来，这还是个蛮有意思的故事呢。好像在辛亥革命发生的时候，他正被派驻在汉口，当时革命党人大肆屠杀满族人，这位好心的小威廷顿救了很多清朝贵族的性命，这些人都是些皇亲国戚，那位姑娘疯狂地爱上了他。嗯，后来的事你也能猜到，当他离开汉口时，她也离家出走了，一直追随着他，现在他走到哪儿，她就跟到哪儿，为了跟她在一起，他不得不辞去公职。可怜的家伙，我敢说他也非常喜欢她。有的时候，这些满族女人也是很有魅力的。哎呀，我应该想到还有上千件事情要做呢，而我坐在这儿跟你闲聊，我真是个糟糕的神职人员，应该感到惭愧。”

第五十二章


凯蒂有一种奇妙的感觉，她正在成长。每天的忙忙碌碌分散了她的注意力，让她有机会观察别人的生活，对未来的展望唤醒了她的想象。她开始精神焕发了，觉得生活越来越好，自己变得越来越坚强。过去的她似乎什么也干不了，只会哭泣，而现在出乎她的意料，一切不再困惑，她自己可以开怀大笑了，即使生活在可怕的瘟疫中心，也开始觉得自然平常。她明知在自己的周围，每天都有很多人死去，但她能够坦然面对。院长嬷嬷禁止她踏足医院，而医院紧闭的大门往往能激起她的好奇心，她真想扒在门缝上往里看看，可担心被别人发现又不能这样做，如果被人看见，她不知道院长嬷嬷会对她进行怎样的惩罚，要是被送回家可就太糟糕了。她现在把全部的心思都放在了孩子们身上，如果她离开了，她们会舍不得的。实际上她也不知道，如果她不在的话，这些孩子该怎么办。

有一天，她忽然意识到，已经有一周她既没有想到过查理，也没有梦到他了。她的心突然快速地跳了一下，她已经走出了这个沼泽，现在可以很平静地看待他，她已经不再爱他了。哦，这种解脱和自由的感觉多美好！回想过去，她还记得当初她是那么狂热地爱着他，这真是匪夷所思的事情。她甚至还想过，如果他不爱她了，她就会痛苦而死，以后的生活会变得了无生趣，只有无尽的伤痛。而现在她已经可以放声大笑了。自己真是没用呀，当初怎么就那么傻呢！而现在，冷静地考虑一下他的情况，她奇怪自己究竟看上了他哪一点。威廷顿幸好对这事一无所知，否则的话，她会无法忍受他嘲弄的眼神和含沙射影的讽刺。她自由了，终于自由了，多么宝贵的自由！她几乎无法控制住自己大声笑了起来。

孩子们正在玩闹和嬉戏，她已经习惯看着她们游戏，在一旁露出宠爱的微笑，如果她们闹得声音太大，她会限制一下，如果玩耍的动作太大，她也会喝止住她们，免得有人受伤。如今她的情绪高涨，感觉就像这些孩子一样，她加入她们的游戏。小姑娘们开心地接纳她的加入，她们在房间里追逐打闹，兴奋得高声喊叫，可以说是极其欢乐的、几乎是疯狂的大合唱。她们越来越开心，屋里洋溢着快乐的气氛，欢闹声快把屋顶都掀翻了。

突然，门开了，院长嬷嬷站在了屋门口。凯蒂有些窘迫地挣脱了一大堆高声尖叫的小姑娘的拉扯。

“你就是这样让这些孩子乖乖地保持安静的吗？”院长嬷嬷问道，嘴角挂着微笑。

“我们正在做游戏，嬷嬷。她们太兴奋了，是我的错，我领她们玩的游戏。”

院长嬷嬷走进了屋子，跟往常一样，孩子们呼啦一下围住了她。嬷嬷用双手搂住了孩子们瘦弱的肩膀，开玩笑般地揪了揪她们的小耳朵。她用一种长时间的、柔和的目光看着凯蒂，凯蒂的脸一下子红了，呼吸也急促起来，她水汪汪的眼睛闪亮着，漂亮的小鬈发由于刚才的打闹和大笑有点儿乱了，样子有些手足无措，但却很可爱。

“你多漂亮呀，我亲爱的孩子。”院长嬷嬷说道，“看着你的模样都赏心悦目，难怪这些孩子那么喜欢你。”

凯蒂的脸变得愈发红了，不知道为什么，泪水突然涌出了眼眶，她用双手蒙住了脸。

“哦，嬷嬷，您让我不好意思了。”

“不用不好意思，别犯傻了，美是上帝赐予的礼物，也是最稀少和珍贵的东西，如果我们能够幸福地拥有它，我们应该感恩；如果我们没有，而别人拥有，能让我们一饱眼福，我们同样也应该感恩。”

好像凯蒂是个孩子，嬷嬷微笑着，用手轻轻地拍了拍她柔软的脸庞。





第五十三章


自从一直在修道院帮忙，凯蒂就很少再见到威廷顿了。有两三次，他来到河边接她，然后他们一起走上山。他到凯蒂的家总会喝上一杯苏打水加威士忌，但是很少留下来吃晚饭。可是，有一个星期天，他建议他们应该随身带着午饭，坐轿椅去一所佛家寺院。这所寺院距离城镇有十英里远，作为一个朝圣之地还有一些名气。院长嬷嬷坚持让凯蒂一周休息一天，不让她在周日还在工作。当然，沃尔特周日仍然同往常一样忙碌。

为了赶在一天的炎热到来之前到达那里，他们很早就动身了。轿夫们抬着轿椅在狭窄的稻田田埂上行走，偶尔他们还经过很恬静的农家院落，一丛丛竹子友好而亲密地依偎在院子的周围。凯蒂很喜欢这种田园气息，被禁锢在拥挤的城镇中，冷不丁来到视野宽阔的乡间，让人心旷神怡。他们来到了寺院，这寺院是由河边零星散落着的一些低矮建筑组成的，庙宇都在树荫之下。面带笑容的僧人们把他们领进了院子，这里空寂而又肃穆，庙里的众神像是各种鬼脸的造型。佛祖的神像端坐在一座大殿中，脸上挂着遥远和悲伤的、沉思的、高深莫测的、淡淡的微笑。这里的每一件东西都有一种忧郁的感觉，昔日的富丽堂皇已经变成了虚骄假饰和冷落破败，神像身上布满灰尘，它们所代表的信仰已经行将就木。僧人们似乎在苦捱度日，好像他们正在等着遣散通知。主持和尚的微笑和彬彬有礼，仿佛是对辞职的嘲讽。某一天，僧人们会远离阴凉的、令人愉快的树林去远游，而这些斑驳和荒凉的庙宇，会受到猛烈暴风雨的打击和周围大自然的围困。野生的爬山虎会盘绕在那些没有生命的神像上，而树木会在院落中自生自灭，到了那时，各种神灵不会在此驻留，只有邪恶的黑暗精灵在此游荡。





第五十四章


他们坐在一座小建筑物前的台阶上（四个上了漆的柱子和高高的倾斜屋顶，屋顶下矗立着一座巨大的铜钟），远眺河水九曲十八弯地缓缓流向疫情严重的城镇，有着垛口的城墙也历历在目，炎热的空气笼罩着城镇，就像给城镇穿了一层厚厚的柩衣一样。但是，这条河流，虽然流动得很慢，可仍然不失流动的感觉，并给人以万物昙花一现的忧伤。一切都会流逝，会有什么痕迹留下来吗？在凯蒂看来，所有人都像河流中的水滴，向前流动，每一滴水彼此靠近，然后又相互远离，汇成无名的波涛奔向大海。一切都那么的短暂，那么的微不足道。人们把过眼云烟的东西看得如此之重，被无聊琐碎的事情搞得痛苦不堪，真是可悲呀。

“你知道哈灵顿花园吗？”她问威廷顿，美丽的眼睛中带着笑意。

“不知道，怎么了？”

“没什么，只是那个地方离这儿很远，我的家人就住在那里。”

“你想回家乡了？”

“没有。”

“我以为你过不了几个月就可以离开这儿了。瘟疫似乎会减弱，凉爽的气候应该可以让它灭绝。”

“我现在几乎舍不得离开这儿了。”

她想了一会儿自己的未来，不知道沃尔特心里做了怎样的安排，他什么也没告诉她。他总是那么不苟言笑、彬彬有礼、沉默寡言和神秘莫测。他们俩就像河里两个小水滴安静地流向了未知的将来。两个小水滴从自己的角度上看，是那么个性迥异，而在外人看来，是河水无法区分的组成部分。

“跟那些修女在一起可得小心，别让她们忽悠你入了教。”威廷顿说道，嘴角带着他坏坏的微笑。

“她们都特别忙，没人顾得上干这种事。她们也都特别棒，人都很善良。可是，我几乎不知道怎么去解释——好像她们和我之间有一堵墙，我不知道这堵墙是什么，就好像她们有一个秘密，使得她们的生活与众不同，而我还没有资格来分享这个秘密。它不是信仰，应该是某种更深刻和更有意义的东西。她们在一个和我们不同的世界里行走，对于她们来说，我们永远是陌生人。当修道院的大门每天在我身后关上的时候，我觉得在她们的眼中，我已经不复存在。”

“我能理解，这种东西对于你的虚荣是一个打击。”他嘲弄地回复道。

“我的虚荣。”

凯蒂耸了耸肩，然后，又一次微笑着、懒洋洋地转过头去看着他。

“为什么你从来没有告诉我，你和一个清朝的格格在同居？”

“这些嚼舌根的老女人都告诉了你些什么？我敢说修女们在背后谈论海关官员的私生活绝对是一种罪过。”

“你为什么那么敏感？”

威廷顿向下瞥了一眼，又向旁边看去，让他看上去很诡秘。他略微耸了一下肩。

“本来就不是什么值得嚷嚷的事，而且我也知道它会极大地影响我的职务升迁。”

“你真的很喜欢她吗？”

他抬起头来，丑陋的小脸上浮现出男人调皮的神情。

“因为我的缘故她抛弃了一切，家庭、亲人、安全和自尊。自从她把一切都抛到九霄云外跟我在一起之后，已经过去好多年了。我曾经把她送回去过两三次，但是最终她又跑回来了，我自己还离家出走过好几次，但她总能找到我。现在我已经彻底投降了，我想余生都得忍受着和她一起过下去了。”

“她一定爱你爱得发疯。”

“那真是一种相当可笑的感觉，你知道。”他回答道，眉毛上扬，面露困惑，“我丝毫也不怀疑，如果我真的离开了她，她绝对会自杀，而且并不怨恨我，反而觉得是理所应当的事，因为如果没有我，她不愿意活在世上。人们会知道，竟然还有这样一种奇怪的感情，对每个人来说，这种感情多少会有些意义的。”

“但是，这种感情是爱，是很重要的东西，被人爱反而不重要。一个人甚至不会对爱自己的人心存感激的。要是一个人并不爱她们，就只会觉得她们厌烦。”

“我没有和多个人谈恋爱的经验，”他回答说，“我只有这样一个。”

“她真的是清朝的格格吗？”

“不是，这种说法是修女们的演绎和夸张，她确实出身于清朝的一个贵族家庭。当然，清朝已经被革命推翻了，但不管怎么说，她还是一个很了不起的女人。”

他用一种骄傲的口吻说道，使得凯蒂的眼中闪过一丝笑意。

“那么你将在这里度过你的余生吗？”

“在中国吗？是的，在别处我还能干什么？等我退休了，我会去北平买一处小的宅院，在那儿度过我的下半辈子。”

“你有孩子吗？”

“没有。”

她好奇地看着他，就这样一个小个儿光头，长着一张猴子脸的男人，怎么会在一个异国的女人心中激起那么巨大的感情波澜呢，真是不可思议。她也搞不清楚他谈论她时，为什么会用那样一种说话方式。尽管他说话时显得随随便便，用的词语也显得油嘴滑舌，但还是能给凯蒂一种强烈的感觉，那个女人对他是一往情深、忠贞不贰的，这倒是让她觉得很困扰。

“回到哈灵顿花园似乎有很长一段路要走。”她笑着说。

“你为什么要说这个？”

“我什么都不明白。生活是如此奇怪。我觉得好像一个人一辈子都生活在一个小水塘边，突然有一天他面朝大海。要换了我，我会有些喘不上气来，但还是会兴高采烈的。我觉得好像一名老水手，扬帆海上去探索未知的海域，我觉得我的灵魂也在渴求探索未知的领域。”

威廷顿若有所思地看着她，而她则出神地凝视着平静的河面。两个小水滴静静地、静静地向着黑色的、永恒的大海流去。

“我能有机会见到那位满族女士吗？”凯蒂忽然抬起了头问道。

“她一句英语也不会说。”

“你一直都很关照我，帮了我很多忙，也许我应该向她表示感谢，并和她交个朋友。”

威廷顿略带讽刺地笑了笑，但还是心情愉快地回答道：

“找一天我过来接你，她会给你沏茉莉花茶的。”

她没有告诉他，这个异国爱情的故事在她第一次听说时就激起了她无尽的想象，那位清朝的格格站立在那儿，就像某个象征性的东西，虽然模模糊糊看不清，但坚持不懈地召唤着她，难以理解地把她指到了一个神秘的精神之地。





第五十五章


然而，过了一两天以后，凯蒂有了一个意想不到的发现。

她像往常一样来到修道院，着手她的第一项工作，看看孩子们是否已经洗漱完毕，穿好了衣服。因为修女们笃信晚上的空气是有害的，所以宿舍里的环境是封闭的，空气污浊。虽然早上有新鲜空气进来，但总是让凯蒂有些不舒服，每次她都尽可能迅速地把窗子打开通风。可今天，她突然觉得特别恶心，头也晕乎乎的，她站在窗户旁边，想使自己安定下来，以前从来没有这么难受过。过了一会儿，她终于控制不住恶心，开始呕吐起来。她的大声呕吐把孩子们吓坏了。那个年龄大一点儿、给凯蒂做小助手的女孩跑过来，看见凯蒂脸色煞白，全身颤抖，她停了下来大声叫人过来帮忙。霍乱！凯蒂的脑海一下子闪过这个念头，随后像被死神扼住的感觉传遍全身，她被吓坏了，挣扎了一会儿，痛苦地抵抗着在她血管中蔓延的黑夜，她觉得自己病得很厉害，然后眼前一黑，就什么都不知道了。

当睁开眼睛的时候，她一开始不知道自己在什么地方。慢慢地她感觉到自己好像躺在地板上，移动了一下头，感觉好像有个枕头在头下。她记不清刚才发生了什么事情。院长嬷嬷正跪在她身边，手里拿着一块嗅盐放到她的鼻子下，圣约瑟夫修女站在旁边注视着她。凯蒂猛地又想起来了，霍乱！她看到了修女们脸上的惊愕表情，圣约瑟夫修女看上去身形巨大，但轮廓并不清楚。恐怖再一次吞没了她。

“哦，嬷嬷，嬷嬷。”她抽泣道，“我快要死了吗？我不想死。”

“你当然不会死。”院长嬷嬷安慰道。

她很镇定，甚至眼睛里能够看出有种觉得好笑的神色。

“但是，我染上了霍乱。沃尔特在哪儿？有人去找他吗？哦，嬷嬷，嬷嬷。”

她放声大哭了起来，院长嬷嬷把手伸给她，凯蒂一把抓住了它，好像它能拉住她害怕失去的生命一样。

“好了，好了，我亲爱的孩子，你别犯傻了。不会是霍乱或者别的什么传染病的。”

“沃尔特在哪儿？”

“你丈夫太忙了，不能受到干扰。过五分钟你就会完全没事了。”

凯蒂用疲惫的眼神目不转睛地看着她，为什么她那么平静？这也太残忍了。

“彻底保持安静一会儿。”院长嬷嬷说道，“根本没事，你别自己吓唬自己。”

凯蒂觉得她的心猛烈地跳着，她已经习惯认为自己是不可能染上霍乱的，哦，她真是个傻瓜！她知道自己快要死了，很害怕。这时，姑娘们搬来一把长藤椅，把它放在了窗户边上。

“来吧，让我们把你抬上去。”院长嬷嬷说道，“在这把椅子上休息会儿，你会更舒服点儿。你觉得自己能站起来吗？”

她把手放到凯蒂的胳膊下，而圣约瑟夫修女帮着抬腿，凯蒂筋疲力尽地躺到了椅子上。

“我最好把窗户关上。”圣约瑟夫修女说道，“早上的空气凉，恐怕对她不好。”

“不，不。”凯蒂说道，“请让它开着。”

看到蓝天，她恢复了信心，虽然身子还在哆嗦，但显然开始觉得好多了。两位修女安静地看了她一会儿，随后，圣约瑟夫修女说了一些她没听明白的话。院长嬷嬷坐在椅子边上，拿起了她的一只手。

“听我说，亲爱的孩子……”

她问了凯蒂一两个问题，凯蒂告诉了她，但不知道她的用意。她的嘴唇颤抖着，几乎话不成句。

“一点儿也不用怀疑了。”圣约瑟夫修女说道，“在这种事上，我可不是容易被骗的人。”

她笑了一下，笑声中凯蒂似乎能分辨出是某种激动和慈爱。院长嬷嬷仍然握着凯蒂的手，微笑中透着关心和柔情。

“圣约瑟夫修女比我在这方面有更多的经验，亲爱的孩子，她立刻判断出了你出了什么状况，很显然，她是对的。”

“您是什么意思？”凯蒂焦急地问道。

“事情明摆着，你从来没想过这种可能吗？你怀孕了，我亲爱的。”

听到这话，凯蒂全身一震，一股寒气从头穿过了脚底。她把脚一下子放到了地上，好像要从椅子上蹦起来。

“躺好，躺好。”院长嬷嬷说道。

凯蒂觉得自己的脸红得发烫，把双手放到了胸口。

“这不可能，这不是真的。”

“她说什么呢？”圣约瑟夫修女问道。

院长嬷嬷给她翻译了一下。圣约瑟夫修女纯朴、红扑扑的脸蛋都开始放光了。

“不可能有错，我敢发誓。”

“你结婚多久了，我的孩子？”院长嬷嬷问道，“为什么你不要孩子，我弟媳妇结婚时间跟你差不多，可她已经是两个孩子的妈妈了。”

凯蒂又躺倒在藤椅上，心里有了个死结。

“我感到很羞愧。”她小声说道。

“就因为你快要有一个宝贝了？为什么，这不是再自然不过的事吗？”

“要是沃尔特医生知道了该有多高兴呀。”圣约瑟夫修女说道。

“是的，试想一下你的丈夫会有多开心，他一定会心花怒放的。你只需看看他和婴儿们待在一起的样子就知道了，他和孩子们一起玩时，脸上的表情别提有多快乐了。我们可以预见，等他有了自己的孩子一定乐开了花。”

有好长时间凯蒂都没有说话，两位修女用温柔的目光好奇地看着她，院长嬷嬷拍了拍她的手。

“竟然没想过可能是怀孕了，我真是太傻了。”凯蒂说道，“不管怎么说，我很高兴我没染上霍乱，现在我没事了，得回去工作了。”

“今天就别工作了，我亲爱的孩子。你今天受惊了，最好还是先回家休息休息。”

“不用，不用，我更想待在这儿工作。”

“你还是听我的话吧，如果我让你这么不小心，我们的好医生会说些什么呢？明天来吧，如果你愿意，或者后天，但是今天你必须休息，我派人去找一张轿椅送你回去，你愿意我派一个年轻的女孩陪着你一起回去吗？”

“哦，不用了，我想我自己一个人就行了。”





第五十六章


凯蒂躺在床上，百叶窗已经拉上。午饭过后，仆人们也去睡觉了。她满脑子装的都是今天早上知道的这个消息（现在她当然已经确认这是真的），而且有些惊慌失措。从回到家里的那一刻起，她就一直想把思路捋清，但脑子始终是一片空白，无法集中注意力。突然，她听到了一阵脚步声，脚步声是从皮靴上传来的，所以不可能是仆人们的，当她意识到这脚步声只可能会来自她丈夫，心头立刻被恐惧攫住了。他在客厅里，她也听见叫她的名字了，但她没回答，沉寂了一会儿后，传来了一阵敲门声。

“谁呀？”

“我能进来吗？”

凯蒂从床上坐起来，套上了晨衣。

“好的。”

他走进了她的卧室，她很庆幸紧关着的百叶窗能让她的脸处在阴影中。

“希望没吵醒你，我敲得非常轻。”

“我其实没睡着。”

他走近其中一扇窗子，把百叶窗拉开了。温暖的阳光如洪水般倾泻进了房间。

“怎么回事？”她问道，“为什么今天你回来得这么早？”

“修女们说你病了，我想还是早点儿回来好，看看你怎么了。”

一阵怒气穿过她的全身。

“如果说我染上了霍乱，你会怎么想？”

“如果真像你说的那样，她们上午就不会把你送回来了。”

她走到梳妆台前，用梳子拢了拢额前的刘海。她想争取点儿时间，坐下来后，点着了一支香烟。

“我今天上午身体不太好，院长嬷嬷认为我最好回来休息，但是我现在完全好了。明天我会像往常一样去修道院的。”

“你身体出什么状况了？”

“她们没告诉你吗？”

“没有，院长嬷嬷说必须由你自己告诉我。”

这时，他做了一件近来几乎不怎么做的事，他端详着她的脸。他职业的本能超过了个人的好恶。她犹豫了一下，然后迫使自己正视他的目光。

“我怀孕了。”她说道。

她已经习惯了他的做法，本来她指望能够让他大呼小叫的话他往往会用沉默对待，而现在他不这样了，反而更让她惊恐万分。他什么也没说，也没做出任何手势，脸色凝固了，黑色的眼睛没有任何神情的改变表明他已经听见了她的话。她想要哭，如果一个男人爱他的妻子，而他的妻子也爱他的话，在这样一个幸福的时刻，强烈的感情会让他们的心贴得更近。沉默让人难以忍受，她首先打破了它。

“我不知道为什么我以前没有想到，我太笨了，但……近来一件事接着另一件事……”

“你这样多长时间了……你的预产期是什么时候？”

这些话似乎很难说出口，她觉得他的喉咙跟她的一样干涩，她说话的时候嘴唇也是这样颤抖，这让她觉得很讨厌。如果他不是铁石心肠的话，这件事一定会激起他的同情。

“我想这样有两三个月了。”

“我是孩子的父亲吗？”

她倒吸了一口气，隐约能感到他的声音有一种震颤，他冷静的自控力是挺可怕的，能抹去话语中最微不足道的感情变化的痕迹。她不知道为什么突然想到了在香港曾经见到过的一种仪器，如果上面的针稍微摆动一下，就代表着一千英里远的地方发生了地震，也许有一千人在地震中已经失去了生命。她看着他，他的脸色煞白，以前她见过一两次他的这种脸色。他低着头，扭过脸去。

“嗯？”

她的双手紧握，知道如果她给出肯定的答案，对他来说将拥有整个世界。他会相信她的话的，他当然会相信她，因为他希望是这样的结果，那么接下来，他会原谅她的，她知道他有着无尽的柔情，也准备迸发出来，但由于羞怯，埋藏到了内心深处。她知道他不是一个报复心很强的人，只要给他一个理由，他会原谅她的，如果能够有一个借口触动了他内心最柔软的部分，他会完完全全原谅她的，能够指望他对过去既往不咎，闭口不提的。虽然他可能有些残忍、冷酷和病态，但是他既不卑鄙也不小心眼儿。如果她说是的，一切都会改变。

而她现在急需别人的怜爱，当她得知自己怀孕的消息后，先是有些措手不及，然后开始有了奇怪的希望和莫名的憧憬。她觉得有点儿虚弱、害怕，自己孤身一人，远离朋友。虽然她很少想到自己的母亲，但今天上午突然渴望母亲能在她的身边，她太需要帮助和安慰了。她不爱沃尔特，知道自己绝不可能爱上他，但是今天上午她真心渴望他能把她揽入怀中，她能够把头枕在他的胸口，紧贴着他，她能幸福地大哭，她想让他亲吻她，也想用自己的胳膊搂着他的脖子。

她开始抽泣了，以前她的谎话说得太多了，所以现在可以张口就来。如果谎话对大家有好处，撒一个又何妨？谎话、谎话，什么是谎话？对沃尔特的问题说“是的”太容易了。她好像看见他冰冷的眼神融化了，他向她伸出了双臂。但她不能那么说，也不知道什么原因，但她就是不能。在过去痛苦的几周里，她经历了一切，查理的寡情薄义，霍乱和那些垂死的人，修女们，古灵精怪甚至有些滑稽、整天醉醺醺的小个子威廷顿，都似乎改变了她，以至于自己都认不出自己了。虽然她被深深地感动着，但灵魂深处的旁观者似乎用一种惊恐和吃惊的神态在观察着她。她必须得说真话，但可以说谎的时候，说真话似乎不值得。她的思想在做着奇怪的斗争，突然，她好像见到了在院墙根上死去的那个乞丐，为什么她会想起他来呢？她没有发出呜咽声，但从她的眼里，泪水轻易地喷涌而出。最后，她回答了那个问题，也就是他问她，他是否是她肚子里孩子的父亲。

“我不知道。”她说道。

他发出了像鬼哭一般咯咯的笑声，让凯蒂不寒而栗。

“有那么一点儿难为情，是吧？”

他的话带有自己的特点，她也预料到了他会这么说，但是还是使得她的心沉了下去。她想知道他是否认识到对她来说道出实情是多么的难（同时，她也意识到说真话自己需要多么大的勇气，但又不可避免），而且他是否相信她的话。她的回答“我不知道，我不知道”不停地在她的脑海中回响，现在不可能把它收回了。她从包里拿出了手绢擦干了眼泪。他们俩又都不说话了，她床边的桌子上有一个虹吸水瓶，他给她到了一玻璃杯水，把水杯靠近她的嘴边，而且在她喝水的时候一直端着水杯。她这才注意到他的手是多么的消瘦，本来这是一双很有型的手，手指细长，但是现在只剩下皮包骨头了。他拿杯子的手在微微颤抖，他能控制住面部表情，但他的手背叛了他。

“别介意我哭。”她说道，“真的没什么，只是我自己控制不住眼里的泪水要往下流。”

她喝完了水，他又把杯子放了回去，坐在椅子上，点着了一支香烟，轻轻地叹了口气。以前她听见过他一两次像这样的叹气，总是会让她的心揪着。现在再看他，眼睛出神地盯着窗外，她很吃惊，前一阵子没有注意到在过去的几周里，他憔悴消瘦得厉害，太阳穴已经凹陷下去，脸上的颧骨也愈发突出，衣服穿在身上咣里咣当，好像是个头比他大一号的人穿的。被太阳晒黑的脸透着瓜菜色的苍白，看上去有些筋疲力尽。他工作得太辛苦了，睡眠很少，几乎不吃什么东西。她难过和不安之余，还是有些心疼他。想想她从未为他做过什么，自己也觉得有些过分。

他把手放在前额上，头痛欲裂，她也觉得在他的脑海中，这些词汇也在不断疯狂地敲击着：“我不知道，我不知道”。凯蒂觉得纳闷，这个忧郁、冷淡和羞怯的男人对很小的婴儿会有一种自然的感情流露，大多数的男人都不怎么在意婴儿，哪怕是他们自己的孩子，而让修女们既感动又觉得好玩的是，沃尔特对孩子的喜爱，她们不止一次说起过这一点。如果他对这些好笑的、弱小的中国孩子都那么喜爱的话，更何况他自己的亲生骨肉呢？凯蒂紧咬着嘴唇，防止自己再哭出声来。

他看了看手表。

“恐怕我必须赶回城里了，今天有很多的事情要做……你没事了吧？”

“哦，是的，不用担心我。”

“我想今天晚上你最好不用等我了，我可能会回来得很晚，我会去余上校那儿吃饭。”

“好的。”

他站起身来。

“如果我是你的话，今天什么活都不要干了。你最好放松些，在我走前，你还需要什么东西吗？”

“不需要了，谢谢。我会很快好起来的。”

他停顿了一小会儿，好像还在犹豫着什么。随后，他突然拿起帽子，一眼也没看她，径直走出了房间。她听见他穿过院落的脚步声，然后，自己再次陷入了可怕的孤独之中。现在不用憋着了，她尽情地放声大哭起来。





第五十七章


夜晚很闷热，凯蒂坐在窗户旁边，看着远处那些怪诞的屋顶，在黑夜的星光的照耀下，能够辨别出那些是中国寺庙的屋顶。终于，沃尔特回来了，她的眼睛因为哭得太厉害又红又肿，但是她很镇静。尽管她觉得周围的一切都在骚扰着她，也许只是累极了，令人感到奇怪的是她异常平和。

“我以为你已经睡了。”沃尔特进屋后说道。

“我不困，我想坐起来可能会更凉快点儿。你吃过晚饭了吗？”

“吃过了。”

他在长条形的房间里走来走去，她看出来他有话要对她说。她心里也知道他不知如何开口，她很平静地等着他说出解决方案。他突然开口了。

“我一直在考虑你今天下午告诉我的那些话，在我看来，如果你走了，可能会更好一些。我已经跟余上校谈过了，他会给你派个卫兵，你还可以带着女仆陪着你，路上会很安全的。”

“我还能去哪儿？”

“你可以去你母亲家。”

“你觉得她看见我会高兴吗？”

他停顿了一会儿，有点儿犹豫，好像在考虑什么。

“那你就回香港。”

“在香港我能干什么？”

“你需要有人照料，我觉得让你留在这儿是不公平的。”

她忍不住笑了，笑容中不仅有苦涩，还有直白的嘲弄。她瞥了他一眼，快要笑出了声。

“我不知道为什么你要担心我的健康。”

他走到窗户边，站在那儿注视着夜空，在没有一丝云彩的天空上，从来没有见过有这么多的星星。

“这个地方不适合你这种情况的女人。”

她看着他，瘦削身体上穿着白色的衣服，映衬着黑暗，在他英俊的侧影中有某种危险的东西，然而奇怪的是，此时此刻，并未激起她的恐惧。

“当你坚持要我来这儿的时候，是不是想让我死在这儿？”她突然问道。

他很长时间没有吭声，她觉得他故意在装聋作哑。

“一开始是这样的。”

她浑身一哆嗦，因为这是他第一次承认了自己的动机，但是她宁愿相信他没有这种邪恶的想法。她也不恨他，自己的这种感觉让她吃惊，她甚至有点儿钦佩自己有这种想法，还有那么一点儿觉得好笑。她不知道为什么会这样，但突然她想到了查理，在她现在看来，他不过是个厚颜无耻的蠢货。

“那你是在冒着可怕的风险。”她回答道，“从你敏感的良知的角度来说，我想知道如果我死了，你是否能够原谅你自己。”

“好吧，你不会死的，你活得好好的。”

“在我的生命中，我觉得没有比现在更好的时候了。”

她有一种冲动，想请求他的宽恕，毕竟他们一起经历了那么多，如今在可怕和被遗弃的土地的包围中仍然活着。总是强调通奸的荒唐行为似乎是愚昧无能的表现。当死神就站在角落里，夺去人们的生命就像园丁拔起土豆，关注这个人或那个人在身体上的不洁失贞是愚蠢的。如果她能让他认识到现在查理在她眼中是多么一钱不值就好了！如今她已经在想象中难觅他的身影，对他的爱情早已从她的心里连根拔掉了。因为她对查理已经没有感情了，她和他一起做的很多事已经失去意义了。既然她已经重新找回了自己的内心，她肉体上的出轨似乎就不该受到严厉地抨击了。她有意跟沃尔特说：“你瞧，你难道不认为我们犯傻已经够久了吗？我们像孩子一样相互怄气，为什么我们不能亲吻对方和成为朋友呢？没有理由仅仅因为我们不是情人就不能成为朋友呀。”

他纹丝不动地站在那儿，灯光使得他那张毫无表情、惨白的脸显得很吓人。她不信任他，如果她说错了，他会用冷冰冰的态度对待她。她现在才知道他那极度的敏感，他那尖刻的嘲讽就是一种保护，如果他的感情受到了伤害，他会很快关闭他的心灵。她对他的愚蠢有点儿生气，最困扰他的事无疑就是对他虚荣心的伤害，她依稀意识到这是所有伤害中最难治愈的。男人们把他们妻子的忠贞看得如此之重真是件奇特的事。当她第一次和查理约会的时候，她以为会有完全不同的感觉，一个改变了的女人，但是她似乎还是她自己，完全一样，她不过是体验到了某种幸福和更多的活力。她现在希望能够告诉沃尔特孩子是他的就好了，这句谎言对她来说无所谓，但肯定会给他带来最大的安慰。而且，无论怎样，这句话很可能还不是谎言。真是可笑，在她心中有某种东西已经阻止她从模棱两可的怀疑中给她带来好处。男人们是多么愚蠢呀！他们繁衍后代的角色是如此无关紧要，恰恰是女人在怀胎十月期间承受着不便与痛苦，而一个男人仅仅因为他短暂地与此事相关，便荒唐地宣称自己是个伟大的父亲。孩子亲生与否，对他们真的那么重要吗？然后，凯蒂的思想又转移到了她自己所怀的孩子身上，她想到这一点时，既没有带着亲密的感情，又没有带着母爱的热情，而是带着一种无聊的好奇。

“我敢说，你最好还是三思而行。”沃尔特说道，他的话打破了长时间的沉默。

“三思什么？”

他向她转过脸去，好像很吃惊。

“考虑一下你何时走。”

“可是我不想走。”

“为什么不想走？”

“我喜欢修道院的工作，在那儿我会觉得自己有用，我宁愿和你一起待在这儿。”

“我认为应该告诉你，以你目前的状况，你可能更容易随时感染上霍乱。”

“我喜欢你做事小心谨慎的方式。”她嘲讽地笑着说道。

“你不是因为我的缘故才留下来的吧？”

她犹豫了一下，他一点儿也不知道现在他在她心中所唤起的最强烈的感情，还有最出乎意料的对他的心疼。

“不，你不爱我。我经常想到，我让你感觉很厌烦。”

“我应该想到你不是那种为了一些古板的修女和一群中国的调皮捣蛋鬼不辞辛苦的人。”

她的嘴边露出了一丝微笑。

“我觉得你这么鄙视我是相当不公平的，因为你对我的判断大错特错，你如此愚蠢不是我的错。”

“如果你决定留下，你当然有自由这么做。”

“很抱歉，我不能给你这个显得你宽宏大量的机会。”她很纳闷地发现认真地和他交流变得如此困难，“事实上，你说得很对，不仅仅是因为这些孤儿我愿意留下来，你知道，我现在的处境很特殊，在这个世界上我还没有找到一个可以追随的灵魂。我知道根本没有人在乎我，我知道根本没有人在乎我的生死。”

他皱了皱眉头，但并没有生气。

“我们已经把事情搞得一团糟了，不是吗？”他说道。

“你还想跟我离婚吗？我认为我不在乎了。”

“你一定要明白，把你带到这儿，我已经是在纵容自己犯罪了。”

“我不明白，你知道，我对不忠没有研究过，当我们离开这儿以后，我们会怎么办？我们还会生活在一起吗？”

“噢，你不认为我们可以走一步说一步吗？”

他的声音里，有一种极度的疲惫。





第五十八章


两三天以后，威廷顿把凯蒂从修道院接了出来（因为她待在家里不踏实，所以马上又回去工作了），领着她去和他的情妇一起喝茶，因为这事他早就答应过她，而凯蒂从未去威廷顿家里吃过饭。那是一座四四方方、显得矫饰的白色房子，全中国海关给他们的官员建的房屋大抵都是这个样子。在餐厅里吃饭，在客厅里聊天，里面摆设着整洁和坚固的家具。这些房屋的外表看上去又像办公室，又像旅馆，而恰恰没有家的气氛，你能理解这些房子只不过是轮换的海关官员们临时的栖身之地。你脑子里绝不会涌现出这样的想法，这些屋子能有什么秘密，或许隐藏了某个爱情故事。他们爬上了一段楼梯，威廷顿打开了门。凯蒂走进一个很大的、空荡荡的房间，白灰刷的墙的四面悬挂着不同字体的书法条幅。四方桌的旁边是一把坚硬的扶手椅，桌椅都是红木的，雕刻着很多图案，椅子上坐着一位满族妇女，当凯蒂和威廷顿进屋的时候，她站起身来，但没有向前迈步迎接他们。

“这就是她。”威廷顿说道，又用中文说了几句话。

凯蒂和她握了手，女主人早已在等着他们了。她穿着南方妇女经常穿的刺绣的旗袍，身材苗条，比凯蒂还要高些。她上身还穿着一件淡绿色的真丝夹克衫，袖子在手腕处收紧。一头乌发，很精致地梳着，上面还有满族妇女常戴的头饰。脸上敷着厚厚的一层粉，从眼睛下面到嘴边的脸颊上涂着很重的胭脂，她修过的眉毛是一条黑线，而嘴唇抹得鲜红。在如同面具般的脸上，黑色的眼珠稍微有些斜视，一双大眼睛水汪汪的好像湖水流淌一般。她看上去更像是一个被人追逐的偶像，而不是普通人家的主妇。她的动作慢条斯理，但信心十足。她给凯蒂留下的印象是有点儿害羞，但她对凯蒂也很好奇。当威廷顿谈到她时，她会注视着凯蒂，点两三下头。凯蒂也注意到了她的手，双手修长，手指纤细，颜色如象牙一般，精致的指甲涂着色。凯蒂思忖她从来没有见过这么可爱、慵懒和优雅的手，它们暗示着有上百年贵族血统的教养。

她说话不多，但音调较高，就像果园中鸟儿叽叽喳喳的声音，而威廷顿在一旁翻译着，告诉凯蒂她很高兴见到她，她还问凯蒂多大了，有几个孩子了。他们坐在四方桌边的三把椅子上，仆人端上来三碗茶，淡淡的，散发着茉莉花的清香。这位满族女士又递给凯蒂一个绿色锡制烟盒的“三炮台”牌香烟。除了桌子、椅子，房间里几乎没有什么家具。卧室里有一张宽宽的硬板床，上面有一个刺绣的枕头，以及两个檀香木的柜子。

“她成天自己一个人待着都干点儿什么呀？”凯蒂问道。

“她有时画画，有时写诗，但大部分时候都坐着，她抽鸦片烟，但幸亏抽得不多，因为我的职责之一就是阻止鸦片走私。”

“你也抽鸦片吗？”凯蒂问道。

“很少抽，跟你说实话，我更爱喝威士忌。”

房间里有着淡淡的刺鼻的味道，并非难闻，只是有点儿特殊和异国的情调。

“告诉她我很抱歉不能跟她交谈，我敢肯定我们有很多事情可以告诉对方。”

当这句话翻译给满族女士听的时候，她很快地瞥了凯蒂一眼，眼中有一丝笑意。她的坐姿给人印象很深，落落大方，她穿着美丽的衣服，化了妆的脸上目光警觉、沉着和高深莫测。她是不真实的，就像一幅画像，然而身上的那种气定神闲和优雅精致让凯蒂觉得自己笨手笨脚的。命运之神把凯蒂带到了中国，但她从来没怎么关注过这里，觉得自己只是个过客，甚至对这里的一切有点嗤之以鼻，并没有完全融入这里的生活。现在突然之间她好像略微了解了这里的某些遥远而神秘的东西，这就是东方，古老、黑暗和神秘莫测。西方的信仰和理念与东方的相比，显得如此粗俗。这种比较，可以从这位精致的女人身上窥见一斑。这儿有着不同的生活，与西方在不同的层面上。凯蒂觉得很奇怪，从这位如偶像般的女人身上，从她涂脂抹粉的脸上和斜视的、警觉的目光中，凯蒂原来所了解的日常生活中的种种努力和苦痛，都显出了些许的荒诞。在彩色的面具之下，似乎隐藏着丰富、深刻和更有意义的生活体验的秘密，而那双细长的纤纤玉手则握着不解之谜的钥匙。

“她一整天都会思考什么？”凯蒂问道。

“什么也不想。”威廷顿笑着说。

“她真的很漂亮，告诉她，我从来没见过一双这么美丽的手。我很奇怪她看上了你什么。”

威廷顿笑着把这个问题翻译给了她听。

“她说我很不错的。”

“就像女人永远会因为男人的品行而爱上他一样。”凯蒂嘲弄地说道。

这个满族女人破天荒地笑出声过一次。凯蒂为了打破沉默，说她非常喜欢这个女人戴在手上的玉镯。她把它从手腕上褪下来，而凯蒂想把它戴在手上时，却发现虽然她的手足够小，但镯子无法穿过关节处。这时，满族女人爆发出了孩子般的笑声。她对威廷顿说了些什么，然后叫一个女仆上来，跟她交代了一句，女仆不一会儿就拿来了一双非常漂亮的满族特有样式的布鞋。

“如果你能穿下，她想把这双鞋送给你。”威廷顿说道，“你会发现这鞋作为卧室穿的拖鞋非常合适。”

“肯定会很合适。”凯蒂满意地说道，但是她注意到威廷顿脸上掠过一丝调皮的微笑。

“这鞋对她来说太大吗？”她很快问道。

“可不是一星半点儿的大。”

凯蒂笑出了声，当威廷顿把这话翻译过去时，满族女士和女仆也都笑了起来。

凯蒂和威廷顿一起向山上走去，过了一会儿，她转过身，向他露出友好的微笑。

“你还没告诉我，你也特别爱她吧。”

“什么情况让你有这种想法？”

“我从你眼中看出来的，很奇怪，它就像喜欢一个幻影或一个梦境。男人们是不可估量的。我原来以为你和其他人一样，但现在我觉得有点儿摸不透你了。”

当他们到达平房时，他突然向她发问。

“你为什么想见她？”

凯蒂在张口之前，犹豫了一下。

“我正在寻找某个东西，但又不十分清楚它是什么。我知道搞清楚它对我来说很重要，如果我明白了，一切都会大不同。也许修女们知道它，当我和她们在一起时，我能感觉到她们保守着这个秘密，又不愿意告诉我。我不知道为什么突然有了种念头，如果我能见到这个满族女士，我应该能够摸索到我苦苦追寻的东西的踪迹。或许她能告诉我这个东西是什么。”

“你怎么就认为她能知道这个东西是什么呢？”

凯蒂从侧面看了他一眼，但没有回答，反而又问了他一个问题。

“你知道它是什么吗？”

他笑了，耸了耸肩膀。

“也许是‘道’吧，有的人从鸦片中寻找，有的人从上帝那儿寻找，有的人从威士忌中寻找，有的人从爱情中寻找。但最终都一样，它引导我们去了乌有乡。”





第五十九章


凯蒂再次投入到每天例行的工作之中，这让她觉得很踏实，虽然每天一大早，能够感觉到身体有所不适，但她有精神和毅力不受干扰。她很吃惊地发现，修女们开始对她格外关注起来。当她在走廊上遇见这些修女时，以前不过是跟她简单地打个招呼，而现在会有一搭没一搭地找个借口去她待的房间看望一下她，带着甜蜜的和孩子般的兴奋和她聊会儿天。圣约瑟夫修女反复地说——有时甚至有些啰唆，她可能一直自己叨叨了好几天了——“现在，我想知道……”或者“我一点儿也不奇怪……”，当凯蒂有点儿虚弱时，圣约瑟夫修女又会说：“毫无疑问，它逃不过我的眼睛。”她跟凯蒂讲了很多她弟妹怀孕时的故事，这些故事只是让凯蒂觉得好笑，没有一丁点儿借鉴作用。圣约瑟夫修女能够把自己成长的背景（一条小河蜿蜒流过她父亲农庄的草地，矗立在岸边的杨树在微风中摆动）和对宗教有关东西的亲密，用一种令人愉快的方式结合起来。有一天，她坚定地宣称异教徒是无法理解此类事情的，她向凯蒂讲述了天使报喜节[1]。

“我每次读圣经都会泪流满面。”她接着说道，“我不知道为什么，但它给了我一种特有意思的感觉。”

然后她又用法语开始说了，这些词语凯蒂听上去不太熟悉，但一字一句显得很准确，她用冷静的语气引用道：

“天使降临，对她说，玛利亚，不要害怕，上帝与你同在，你在万千妇女中得到赐福。”

关于生育的神秘的传闻在修道院中传播，犹如一阵阵的风在果园盛开的白色花朵中刮过。凯蒂怀孕的事实让那些不能生育的修女们既困扰又激动，她让她们害怕，又让她们着迷。她们看着她身体的变化充满了好奇，因为她们是农民或者渔夫的女儿，在她们孩子般天真的心灵中对生育之事很敬畏。她们想到她的肚子一天比一天大，觉得很麻烦，但也高兴和莫名的兴奋。圣约瑟夫修女告诉她，她们都在为她祈祷，圣马丁修女甚至还说，她不是一个天主教徒真是可惜。但是院长嬷嬷为此还斥责过她，说不是天主教徒也可能是个好女人——一位勇敢的女人，院长还说即使一个人是新教教徒，上帝也会用某种方式或其他方式安排好一切的。

凯蒂对她所引起的关注既感动又有点儿分心，但是更多的是吃惊，因为她发现就连院长嬷嬷，这么一个恪守清规戒律的圣徒，也在用一种新的殷勤态度对待她。她本来一直就对凯蒂很好，但总保持着一定的距离，而现在她对凯蒂非常体贴温柔，里面还带有母爱的成分。她对凯蒂说话时总是和颜悦色，轻声细语，看着凯蒂时，好像她是一个小孩子正在做一件聪明而有趣的事情，目光中突然带有了某种觉得好玩的神色。真是奇怪而又令人感动。她的心灵就像一片灰色的平静大海，雄伟壮观而即使阴沉时，也能激起人们的敬畏。然而，突然一缕阳光使它变得活跃、友好和快乐起来。现在在傍晚的时候，她经常也会过来和凯蒂坐一会儿。

“我必须过来关照一下你，可别累着自己，我亲爱的孩子。”她说道，而且还为自己找了一个明显的借口，“否则的话，费恩医生绝不会原谅我。哦，他这个英国人的自制力可真强！明明他的喜悦无法估量，可你跟他谈到这个话题时，他的脸色会变得苍白。”

她拿起凯蒂的手，充满怜爱地拍着它。

“费恩医生告诉我说，他希望你离开这儿，但是你不愿意，因为你不想跟我们分开。你真是太好了，我亲爱的孩子，我想让你知道，我们大家都很感激你一直以来对我们的帮助，我也觉得你舍不得我们，而且，你能陪在他身边，是比较好的选择，他也需要你。哈，我真不知道如果没有这位令人钦佩的男人，我们应该怎么办了。”

“看到他能够为你们做一些事情我很高兴。”凯蒂说道。

“你必须全心全意地爱他，我亲爱的，他是个圣人呢。”

凯蒂微笑着，但心里叹了口气。现在她只能为沃尔特做一件事，可她又不知道怎么去做。她想得到他的谅解，不再是为她自己，而是为了沃尔特。因为她觉得只有这样，才能让他的内心安宁。向他求得原谅也没有用，如果他怀疑她希望得到原谅是为了他，而不是为了自己，他执拗的虚荣心会让他不惜一切代价拒绝的（她纳闷为什么他的虚荣心现在不会让她生气了，它似乎是很自然的事，只是让她更为他感到遗憾）。唯一的机会就是有某件出乎意料的事情发生，让他失去自我防卫。她有了一个主意，他会欢迎感情的迸发，从而使他从怨恨的噩梦中解脱出来，但是，在他令人同情的傻劲儿中，他可能会把自己封闭起来，并全力抵抗感情的进攻。

在一个充满痛苦的世界中，男人作为匆匆过客，还在自我折磨，这难道不可悲吗？

第六十章


虽然院长嬷嬷和凯蒂谈话不超过三四次，其中也就有一两次能谈个十分钟，但她给凯蒂留下的印象很深。她的性格就像一个国家，刚结识它时，能感受到它的宏大，但缺乏好客的热情。随着了解的深入，你可以渐渐发现在雄伟的大山的山谷之中，在无数果树的遮挡之下有着对你笑脸相迎的小村庄，还有让你神清气爽的河流，缓缓地在繁茂的草丛中流过。但是这些赏心悦目的景色，虽然让你惊奇，甚至让你坦然和放松，但它们还不足以让你觉得宾至如归，只有黄褐色的高地和风呼啸过的平原，才是自己的故土家园。和院长嬷嬷关系变得亲密无间似乎不太可能，她身上有种缺乏人情味的东西，这是凯蒂和别的修女在一起也能感受到的，甚至在好脾气、爱聊天的圣约瑟夫修女身上也能感受到，和院长嬷嬷在一起，这种感觉就更加明显了。它能让你有一种奇妙的感觉，寒冷而令人敬畏，她和你一样在同一片土地上行走，处理世俗的事务，但是她的生活状态显而易见是你无法达到的层面。她曾经有一次对凯蒂说：

“一个有宗教信仰的人不断地向耶稣祷告是不够的，她应该向自己的内心祷告。”

虽然她的谈话中交织着她的信仰，凯蒂觉得这很正常，不费劲就影响了不信教的人。但似乎让她感到不可思议的是，院长嬷嬷尽管很有慈爱之心，却能很安心地让凯蒂处于罪孽深重的愚昧状况中。

一天晚上，她们两人正坐在一起，白天变得越来越短，夜晚柔和的光线让人惬意之中有着些许忧郁。院长嬷嬷看上去很疲惫，她悲天悯人的面孔显得憔悴和苍白，炯炯有神的黑眼睛失去了往日的激情，她的疲乏或许是在敦促她寻求更为难得的信心。

“这对我来说是值得纪念的一天，我的孩子。”她说道，仿佛从长时间的幻想中醒来，“就是在多年前的这一天，我最后决定皈依宗教。我用了两年的时间一直在考虑这个问题，但是我很痛苦，因为对于这种召唤我很害怕，而且还因为担心自己很可能会再次被这个世界上的俗念所俘虏。可就在那天早上，当我在与意念交流时，我发了誓，我要在夜晚降临之前向母亲宣布我的决定，在圣餐礼[1]后，我请求上帝给我思想上的安宁。这时，我似乎找到了答案，只有当你已经放弃得到它的欲念，你才会真正拥有它。”

院长嬷嬷似乎陷入了对过去的回忆中，有点儿忘我。

“那一天，我的一位朋友，维尔诺女士已经动身去了卡梅尔而没有告诉她的家人，她知道他们会反对她的行动，但是她是一位寡妇，觉得有权利去做自己愿意做的事。我的一位表姐去送这位亲爱的逃亡者，直到晚上才回来，而且对这位逃亡者的行为特别感动。我还没有把我的想法告诉母亲，一想到我要把自己内心的想法向她和盘托出，我就禁不住颤抖。然而，我还是希望就按我在圣餐礼上的决定去做。我问了表姐各种各样的问题，我的母亲好像集中了全部的注意力在织她的挂毯，没有说话。我自言自语地说，如果我想今天就说，当下就是机会。

“很奇怪我现在还能清清楚楚地记得当时的情景。我们坐在一张圆桌旁，圆桌上盖着红色的桌布，我们在一盏有着绿罩的灯下工作。我的两个表姐和我们一起，正在织着坐垫，坐垫是准备放在客厅的那几把椅子上的。试想，从路易十四时代起，这几把椅子就没有坐垫，它们被买回来时又破旧又褪色，我母亲说这太不体面了。

“我试图想厘清我要说的话，但发现还是无法张口。接下来，经过了几分钟的沉默之后，我母亲突然对我说道：‘我真的不能理解你朋友的行为，我不喜欢她这种对所有的亲人都不告而别的方式，这和我的处事理念是格格不入的。一个教养良好的女人不应该去做让人们说三道四的事情。我希望如果有一天你想离开我们，虽然我们会很难过，但你千万不要匆匆出逃，好像你犯了什么罪似的。’

“这一刻我该开口了，但是我太软弱了，说出口的话却是：‘啊，您放心，妈妈，我还没有那种勇气。’

“我母亲没有回答，我暗自懊悔，因为我不敢多说几句，为自己的想法解释一下。我似乎听到了上帝对圣彼得所说的话：‘彼得，你不爱我吗？’哦，我是多么的软弱，多么的忘恩负义呀！我爱舒适的生活方式，爱我的家人和平常的消遣娱乐。我正迷失在胡思乱想中，没过一会儿，好像刚才的对话没有被打断一样，我母亲对我说：‘冷静，我的奥黛特，如果不去做那些不得不做的事，我觉得你也死不了。’

“我仍然在我的焦虑和思索中不知所措，而我的表姐妹们，全然不知我心跳得有多厉害，她们在静静地穿针走线。这时，我的母亲，突然把她手中的织物放下了，认真地看着我说：‘呃，我亲爱的孩子，我敢肯定，你最终的结局就是成为一名修女。’

“‘此话可当真，我亲爱的母亲？’我答道，‘您把我内心深处的想法和我多年来的愿望明白无误地说出来了。’

“‘是啊。’我的表姐妹们喊道，没给我时间让我说完，‘这两年时间，奥黛特没想别的，成天想的就是去做修女，您不会同意的吧，姑姑，您一定不会同意的。’

“‘我亲爱的孩子们，我有什么权利拒绝她呢？’我母亲说道，‘如果那是上帝的旨意。’

“然后，我的表姐妹们开玩笑似的抢着跟我说话，问我打算怎么处理我的东西，快乐地争吵着哪件东西应归谁。但这些欢闹的气氛没持续多久，我们就开始哭泣了。这时，我们听见楼梯上传来的父亲的脚步声。”

院长嬷嬷停了一会儿，叹了口气。

“我父亲一时无法接受，我是他唯一的女儿，男人们通常对女儿的感情要比对儿子的更深。”

“人有感情真是一件大不幸的事。”凯蒂笑着说道。

“把爱奉献给耶稣基督又是一件多么幸运的事。”

就在这时，一个小姑娘跑到院长嬷嬷的身边，兴致勃勃地给嬷嬷看一个她刚刚得到的玩具。院长嬷嬷用她漂亮、纤细的手搂着孩子的肩膀，孩子小鸟依人般地贴着嬷嬷。让凯蒂感动的是，她看到嬷嬷脸上的微笑是那么的甜蜜，又是那么的神圣。

“您能让所有的孤儿都那么喜欢您真是太了不起了，嬷嬷。”她说道，“如果我也能唤起别人对我的爱，也会非常自豪的。”

院长嬷嬷再一次露出超然、美丽的微笑。

“这是唯一能够赢得人心的方式——要想让人爱，必先爱人。”

第六十一章


那天晚上，沃尔特没有回来吃晚饭。凯蒂等了他一段时间，因为他如果在城里有事耽搁了，总是会想方设法派人给她个信儿。最后她还是一个人在桌边坐了下来。她已经不再吃中国厨子做的菜了，原因是这个厨子总是一成不变地按照规矩几菜一汤地准备饭菜，一点儿也不考虑瘟疫的危险和食物供应的困难。简单地用过饭后，她在窗边的一个长条藤椅上躺了下去，四周是星光熠熠的夜空和一片沉寂。

她没有试着去读书，思绪浮在心头，就好像朵朵白云映照在平静的湖面。她太疲倦了，不能厘清这些思绪，无法集中注意力去思考伴随这些思绪的问题。她在恍惚中想搞明白，和修女们交谈后留下的印象到底对她意味着什么。很奇特，虽然她们的生活方式让她深深地感动，但是引发如此生活方式的信仰却没有打动她。她不能设想这种可能性，即她在什么时候也能够被信仰的热情所征服。她轻轻地叹了口气，如果那道伟大的白光能够照亮她的心灵，也许一切将变得简单容易。有一两次，她甚至有种冲动告诉院长嬷嬷她的不幸，但她又不敢这么做。她不能忍受这位纯朴的女人对她产生不好的印象。对她而言，她以前的行为自然是一种深重的罪孽，可奇怪的是，她本人倒是没把它看作是邪恶的行为，只不过把它看作是愚蠢和丑陋的行径。

或许是由于她感觉迟钝，她把自己和查理之间的关系看作是令人遗憾的，甚至让人吃惊的，但是它也应该是需要忘记的，而不是有什么懊悔的。就像在一场聚会上所犯的无心之过，现在后悔也于事无补，事情本身是屈辱的，但是她自己缺少一种意识，认定事情是多么的重要。当她想到查理，心里也会咯噔一下。他对自己身材的缺点隐藏得恰到好处，他平常会把下巴收一下，使得大下巴不太明显，站立的时候会挺着胸，这样看上去，他的肚腩也会小一些。他乐观自信的性情很容易表现出来，因为他的血管充血后，很快就能让他面色红润起来。她曾经喜欢他的浓眉，而现在她觉得那像动物的粗毛，让人厌恶。

未来会怎么样？奇怪的是她根本无所谓，也许她也根本无法预见。也许她会死于难产，她的妹妹多瑞丝身体比她好得多，可多瑞丝在生孩子时差点儿死去（她已经尽到了自己的责任，已经生下了准男爵爵位的继承人。凯蒂想到她母亲心满意足的样子，自己先笑了）。如果未来是那么模糊不清，也许意味着她注定无从预见。沃尔特可能会让她的母亲照料这个孩子——如果这个孩子能活下来的话。她了解他的个性，他肯定会这么做的，但她不能确定他对这孩子的父爱有多少，他可能还是会善待这个孩子的。沃尔特在任何情况下都值得信任，而且勇于担当。他有着那么多可贵的品质，他的无私和荣誉感，他的智慧和敏感，可就是很可惜，他可敬但不可亲。至少她现在不再害怕他了，只是为他感到遗憾，同时，她忍不住觉得他有点儿荒唐。他深沉的感情使他变得脆弱，她有一种直觉，也许某一时刻，她会有某种办法让他能够原谅她。这种想法现在总在她的脑海中盘旋，也许只有这样才能让他的内心平静下来，她也只能用这种方式才能弥补她给他带来的痛苦。他没有什么幽默感真是遗憾，有那么一天，她似乎能看见他们两个人一起嘲笑他们曾经彼此折磨对方的方式。

她觉得累了，把灯拿到房间里，脱了外衣，上了床以后很快进入了梦乡。





第六十二章


但是她被一阵大声的敲门声惊醒了。起初，敲门声交织着她正在做的梦，她还分不清是梦境还是现实。有人一直在敲着门，她意识到声音是从院门那儿传来的。外面一片漆黑，她有一块手表，指针是磷光的，能够看出是深夜两点半。一定是沃尔特回来了——今天回来得太晚了——他无法叫醒男仆。敲门声还在继续，而且声音越来越大，在夜晚的寂静中显得格外刺耳。敲门声停了，她听见沉重的门闩被拉开的声音。沃尔特从来没有这么晚回来过，可怜的人，他一定是累坏了！她希望他能直接上床睡觉，而不要像往常那样去他的实验室里工作。

一阵嘈杂的声音传来，有人进了院子。很蹊跷，每次沃尔特回家晚了，为了不打扰她，都会轻手轻脚地进来。两三个人快速跑上木制的台阶，进了隔壁的房间。凯蒂有点儿害怕了，在她意识深处，总是害怕有反抗外国人的暴乱。到底发生了什么事？她的心开始怦怦跳了，但是在她把朦胧的恐惧搞清楚之前，有人已经穿过了客厅，开始敲她卧室的门了。

“费恩太太。”

她听出了是威廷顿的声音。

“嗯，怎么了？”

“你能马上起床吗？我有事跟你说。”

她起床了，披上了睡袍，把门闩拉开，打开了房门。她看到威廷顿穿着一条中国人的裤子和茧绸的外套，家里的男仆手里拿着一盏马灯，他们的身后是三名穿着卡其布军服的士兵。当她看到威廷顿脸上惊慌的神色大吃了一惊，他头发乱糟糟的，好像刚从床上跳起来一样。

“发生什么事了？”她紧张地问道。

“你必须保持冷静，我们一分钟也不能耽搁了，你立刻穿上外衣，跟我走。”

“怎么了？城里发生什么事了吗？”

看到士兵她马上想到是不是发生了什么暴乱，他们被派过来保护她。

“你丈夫病倒了，我们想让你即刻过去。”

“沃尔特吗？”她喊道。

“你先别慌，我还不知道确切的情况，余上校派这个军官来找我，让我马上把你带到衙门去。”

凯蒂惊恐地看了他一会儿，突然觉得心底一凉。随后，她转过身去。

“我两分钟后就会准备妥当。”

“我就这样来了。”威廷顿回答说，“我正在睡觉，我只穿上了一件外套和鞋子。”

她没听见他在说什么，随便拿了一件手边的衣服，借着星光开始穿衣，她的手指变得很笨，费了好长时间才找到扣子把衣服扣好。她把一件在晚上穿的广州人常穿的披肩披在了肩上。

“我还没戴上帽子，但也没必要了，对吧？”

“是的。”

家里的男仆举着灯笼走在他们前面，他们匆忙地走下台阶，出了院门。

“小心别滑倒了。”威廷顿说道，“你最好挽着我的胳膊。”

士兵们快速地跟在了他们的后面。

“余上校已经派人找来了轿椅，他们正在河的对岸等着呢。”

他们迅速地下了山，凯蒂的嘴唇可怕地颤抖着，嘴边的问题不敢问出口，因为她对可能的答案心里怕得要死。他们来到岸边，在船头一丝光线的照射下，一艘小舢板正在等着他们。

“是霍乱吗？”她终于忍不住问道。

“恐怕是的。”

她惊叫了一声又马上住嘴了。

“我认为你应该尽快地赶过去。”他把手递给她，想在她上船时扶她一把。上船的木板很短，河水也几乎不动。他们一群人站在船头，撑船的是个女人，她把一个孩子绑在腰部，用一支船桨把小船摇到了对岸。

“他是今天下午病倒的，昨天下午染上的病。”威廷顿说道。

“那为什么不马上派人跟我说？”

虽然没有必要，但他们说话都尽量压低了声音。在黑暗当中，凯蒂能够感觉到她同伴的焦虑。

“余上校想这样做，但是沃尔特不让。余上校一直在陪着他。”

“他还是应该早点儿告诉我，真是没心没肺。”

“你丈夫知道你从来没见过得霍乱的病人，那景象很可怕的，令人作呕，他不想让你看到。”

“可他毕竟是我的丈夫。”她用哽咽的声音说道。

威廷顿没吭声。

“为什么我现在可以来看他了？”

威廷顿把手放在了她的肩上。

“我亲爱的，你一定要勇敢，你必须有最坏的心理准备。”

她发出了痛苦的哀号，把脸扭到了一边，因为她看到那三个中国士兵正在看着她，她突然很奇怪地看到了他们的眼白。

“他快死了吗？”

“我只知道余上校给我的口信，他派这位军官过来接上了我。据我判断，情况比较危急。”

“一点儿希望都没有了吗？”

“我真的非常抱歉，但恐怕不赶紧到那儿，我们就见不上他最后一面了。”

她浑身颤抖，泪水开始在脸颊上流淌。

“你知道，他总是加班加点地工作，都没有抵抗力了。”

她生气地把手从他胳膊底下抽了出来，他用那种低沉而令人痛苦的声音说话激怒了她。

他们到达了河对岸，两个轿夫正等在岸边，他们帮她上了岸，轿椅已经备好，当她坐上了轿椅，威廷顿对她说道：

“保持镇定，你一定要控制好自己的情绪。”

“告诉轿夫们抓紧时间。”

“他们已经得到要尽可能快的命令了。”

已经坐在轿椅上的那位军官，路过凯蒂的轿椅时，大声呵斥着轿夫快点儿出发。他们很麻利地抬起轿椅，把轿杠放到自己的肩上，迈着快速的步伐出发了，威廷顿的轿椅紧随其后。他们沿着山脚一路小跑，每个轿椅的旁边都有一个人举着灯笼走在前面。在水闸处，守水闸的人正拿着一个火把站在那儿。当他们走近的时候，军官向他喊叫着，他推开了门的一边，让他们鱼贯而过。当他们经过的时候，他发出种种感叹，而轿夫们也回应了他。在死一样沉寂的夜里，用奇怪的语言发出的那些刺耳的声音神秘而吓人。他们在用鹅卵石铺成的又湿又滑的小巷中跌跌撞撞地行进，抬着军官的一位轿夫脚底一滑，差点儿跌倒。凯蒂听到军官生气地骂着，而轿夫们尖声地回嘴，然后前面的轿椅又继续前进了。街道狭窄而又弯弯曲曲，这座城镇正处在深夜当中，它是一座死亡之城。他们沿着一条狭窄的小巷匆匆赶路，拐了一个弯，然后小跑着上了好几级的台阶，轿夫们开始气喘吁吁了，他们在沉默中大步快速走着，一个轿夫拿出了一块破烂的手巾，一边走着，一边擦着额头的汗水，防止流入眼睛。他们加速走在弯弯曲曲的、如同迷宫般的街道上，在窗户紧闭的店铺的阴影中，有时会看到似乎躺着的人形，但你不知道这个睡觉的人是会在黎明时醒来，还是永远地长眠不醒了。狭窄的街道在空寂中如同鬼魅一般，突然有一只狗大声叫了起来，让恐惧弥漫在凯蒂饱受折磨的神经中好一阵子。她不知道他们要去哪儿，路似乎没有尽头。他们难道不能再快一点儿吗？再快点儿，更快点儿。时间在流逝，可每一刻都显得如此漫长。





第六十三章


沿着一面光秃秃的、长长的墙壁走着，猛然间他们来到了一个大门的入口处，大门两边还有哨兵岗亭。轿夫们把轿椅放下，威廷顿急忙向凯蒂的轿椅跑过来，而她早已从轿椅中跳了出来。那位军官大声敲着门，嘴里还喊叫着什么。一个侧门打开了，他们进到了院子里。院子很大，四四方方，靠着墙边，在突出的屋檐之下，士兵们裹着毯子，三个一群五个一伙地挤着躺在地上。当军官和一个可能正在站岗的中士说话的时候，他们在院子里等了一会儿，然后军官扭过身和威廷顿又说了些什么。

“他还活着。”威廷顿用压得很低的声音说道，“小心脚底下。”

前面仍然有拿着灯笼的人给他们开路，他们穿过院子，上了几级台阶，通过了较大的门廊，然后又来到了另一个宽大的院子。院子的一边是一个长条形的卧室，里面亮着灯，灯光透过宣纸，映衬着窗格上造型别致的图案。拿着灯笼的人领着他们穿过院落走到这个房间前，军官敲了敲门。门马上开了，军官看了一眼凯蒂，往后退了一步。

“你进去吧。”威廷顿说道。

这是一个又长又低矮的房间，点着一盏煤油灯，屋里昏暗，有着一种不祥的征兆。三四个士兵在四下站着，在正对着门的墙边上有一张木床，一个男人在床上躺着，蜷缩在毯子里，一个军官正一动不动地站在床脚。

凯蒂急忙奔过去，趴到床边。沃尔特双眼紧闭躺在床上，在昏暗的灯光下，他的脸如死人一般灰白，他静静地躺着，样子很吓人。

“沃尔特，沃尔特。”她用低低的、害怕的声音唤道。

沃尔特的身体略微动了一下，动作之轻就像一阵微风掠过，你根本感觉不到，或者就像瞬间的涟漪拂过平静的水面。

“沃尔特，沃尔特，跟我说话。”

他的眼睛慢慢睁开了，好像使出了全身的力气才把沉重的眼皮撑开，但是他哪儿也没看，盯着离他几英寸远的墙壁。他说话了，他的声音低沉而虚弱，但有一丝笑意在里面。

“这是一个漂亮的鱼缸。”他说道。

凯蒂不敢呼吸，他没有再出声，也没有开始用手势的意思，但是他的眼睛，那双乌黑、冰冷的眼睛（现在看到什么神秘的东西了吗？）盯着刷白灰的墙壁。凯蒂站起了身，心力憔悴地看着站在那儿的那个男人。

“应该能做点儿什么吧，你不能只站在那儿什么也不做吧？”

她攥紧了双手。威廷顿跟站在床脚的军官说了几句话。

“我恐怕他们已经做了一切可能应该做的事了，军医也已经给他治疗过了，他接受过你丈夫的培训，已经做了你丈夫自己能做的一切。”

“你就是那个军医吗？”

“不，这位是余上校。他一步也没离开过你丈夫的左右。”

凯蒂心神纷乱地看了他一眼，他是位个头很高的人，身材也很结实，似乎穿着卡其布军装很别扭。他正在看着沃尔特，她看到他的眼睛里满是泪水，这好像给了她当头一棒，为什么这个黄皮肤、面孔扁平的男人眼中会有泪？她被激怒了。

“我们就眼睁睁地看着他死，这也太可怕了。”

“至少他不再有痛苦了。”威廷顿说道。

她再一次俯下身去，看着她的丈夫。那双吓人的眼睛仍然直勾勾地盯着前方，她不知道他是否看见了他们，也不知道他是否听到了他们的对话。她把嘴唇靠近他的耳边。

“沃尔特，我们还能做些什么？”

她觉得一定有某种药，他们可以给他吃，能够挽留住他即将如潮水般退去的生命。现在她的眼睛已经适应了屋里昏暗的光线，她惊恐地发现他的脸已经塌陷下去了，几乎都认不出来了。真是难以想象，就在几个小时之前，他还是另外一个人。他看上去一点儿也不像个活生生的人了，就像一个死人。

她觉得他正想挣扎着说话，她把耳朵靠近了他的嘴。

“别大惊小怪了，我已经走过了一段艰难的道路，但是我现在没事了。”

凯蒂等了一会儿，他又不吭声了。他的一动不动又让她撕心裂肺地痛苦起来，他就这样静静地躺着是个很可怕的事，好像已经为他静静地躺在坟墓中做好了准备。有个人，也许是军医或者护理员，走上前来，示意她向一旁挪挪身子，他俯身用一条脏毛巾给这个奄奄一息的人的嘴唇润湿了一下。凯蒂再次站起身来，绝望地转向威廷顿。

“一点儿希望也没有了吗？”她轻声说道。

他摇了摇头。

“他还能活多久？”

“没人知道，也许一个小时。”

凯蒂环视了一下这空荡荡的房间，视线落到了余上校魁梧的身材上有一小会儿。

“能让我单独和他待一会儿吗？”她问道，“就一会儿。”

“当然可以，如果你愿意。”

威廷顿上前和余上校说了凯蒂的意思，上校向她略微颔首，然后用低沉的声音命令大家出去。

“我们都到台阶上去等。”当大家依次退出后，威廷顿说道，“有事你叫我们。”

凯蒂还是无法相信眼前的一切都是真的，突然就像一剂药注入了她的静脉，她终于意识到沃尔特要死了，她现在唯一的念头就是让他临终前能够把心中淤积已久的怨恨全部放下，走得轻松些。好像对她而言，如果有她陪着他能心平气和地死去，就意味着他可以独自安宁地踏上黄泉路了。她现在脑子全然没有考虑自己，只想着让他安心走。

“沃尔特，我乞求你的原谅。”她凑近他的耳边说道，怕压着他，她小心地不去碰他的身子，“我对自己做过的对不起你的事感到万分抱歉，我现在真的特别后悔。”

他没说话，似乎也没有听见她的话，她不得不向他继续说着同样的话。很奇怪，她好像觉得他的灵魂就像一只扇动翅膀的飞蛾，而翅膀已经被仇恨填满变得格外沉重，飞不起来了，在地上痛苦地挣扎。

“亲爱的。”

他蜡黄和干瘪的脸上好像有了一丝反应，还谈不上有多大的变化，但足以有了平常抽搐的效果。她以前从来没有称呼过他“亲爱的”，也许在他渐渐失去意识的大脑中会闪过这样的念头，这个称呼怎么这样让人困惑和难以捉摸呢，这个再普通不过的称呼，他只听见她用在小狗、婴儿和小汽车上面。这时，发生了一件恐怖的事情，她紧攥着拳头，想尽一切力量控制住自己，因为她分明看见两颗豆大的泪珠慢慢地从他枯槁的脸颊上滑过。

“哦，我宝贵的，我亲爱的，如果你爱过我——我知道你爱我，而我是那么可恨——我乞求你原谅我。我现在没有机会表达我的悔恨之情了。可怜可怜我吧，我乞求你的原谅。”

她停了下来，大气不敢出地看着他，急切地等着他回答。她看出他想说话，她的心都快跳出了嗓子眼儿，在她看来，如果在最后一刻她能够让他从怨恨与悲苦中解脱出来，也算是用这种方式为她给他造成的种种痛苦做了些弥补。他的嘴唇动了动，没有看她。他的眼睛失神地盯着白墙。她凑近他的嘴边以便能听见他的话。然而，这次他说得十分清晰。

“死的是那条狗。”[1]

她僵住了，好像变成了石头一般。她无法理解他的话，用惊恐而疑惑的神情凝视着他。这话毫无意义，是他在神志不清的状态下说的胡话，他也不能理解她说的每一个字了。

活着的人是不可能这样直挺挺地一动不动的，她盯着他，他的眼睛睁得很大，她不能确定他是否还在喘气，她开始变得害怕起来。

“沃尔特。”她低声地呼唤，“沃尔特。”

最后，她突然站直了身子，一阵突如其来的恐惧震慑住了她，她转过身去奔向了门口。

“来人呀，请快进来，他好像……”

他们进了屋，中国军医来到床前，他按亮了手上的手电棒，照了照沃尔特的眼睛，查看了一下，然后把它们合上了。他用中文说了几句话，威廷顿用双臂搂紧了凯蒂。

“恐怕他已经死了。”

凯蒂深深地叹了口气，泪水从她的眼眶中涌了出来。她觉得有些眩晕，而不是在努力控制自己的情绪。虽然那些中国人也不清楚接下来要干什么，但他们还是围上来，站在了床边，有些束手无策。威廷顿也没有作声，过了一会儿，在他们中间的那个中国人开始用低沉的声音说着什么了。

“你最好让我把你送回家去。”威廷顿说道，“他也会被送回去的。”

凯蒂疲惫地用手摩挲了一下前额，又走到床边，俯下身子，轻轻地亲吻了沃尔特的嘴唇。她现在不哭了。

“很抱歉给你们添了这么多麻烦。”

当她经过人群时，军人们向她敬礼，她庄重地鞠躬还礼。他们穿过院子走了出去，又坐上了轿椅。她看见威廷顿点燃了一支香烟，一股青烟飘散在空气中，慢慢消失了，就像人的生命。

[1]一个非常著名的典故，出自十八世纪英国诗人戈德史密斯《挽歌》一诗。大意是好心人收留了一条狗，后来人畜反目，狗发疯将人咬伤。大家都认为那个好心人会死掉，最终死的却是狗。





第六十四章


天已经破晓，街上各处店铺的中国人正摘下门板，准备开业。在店铺的黑暗处，借着蜡烛的光线，一位妇女正洗着手和脸。在茶馆的一个角落中，一群人正在吃着早点。升起的日头散发出灰白、清冷的光线，从狭窄小巷的侧面偷偷地照射进来，如同窃贼一般。河面上弥漫着白色的雾气，雾气中拥挤的小船上的桅杆时隐时现，仿佛幽灵军队的长矛在逼近。当他们渡河时，一股寒意阵阵袭来，凯蒂把自己裹在艳丽的花花绿绿的披肩中。他们走到了山上，也身处在云雾缭绕之中。太阳从万里无云的天空上照耀着，好像这一天跟其他日子没有什么两样，什么事也没有发生。

“你不想躺会儿吗？”当他们走进平房，威廷顿说道。

“不了，我还是在窗户边坐会儿吧。”

她在过去的几周里，经常坐在窗边，长久地眺望外面，她已经对远处城堡之中梦幻般的、金碧辉煌的、美丽多姿的、神秘莫测的庙宇非常熟悉了，它能够让她的心神平静下来。一切都好像那么不真实，甚至就在正午未加遮掩的阳光之下，她竟脱离了现实的生活。

“我让男仆给你沏点儿茶，恐怕今天上午就得埋葬他了。我得做点儿准备。”

“谢谢你。”





第六十五章


三个小时以后，他们埋葬了他。在凯蒂看来，他不得不被安放在中国式样的棺材里，好像他必须很难受地躺在一张不舒服的床上一样，这太可怕了，但她又无能为力。修女们知道了沃尔特的死讯，就如同知道城里发生的一切一样。她们派人送来了大丽花编成的十字花环，死板而缺乏生气，但是好像还是出自花艺师惯常的手法，而这个十字花环，被孤零零地放在中国样式的棺材上，看上去荒诞不经和不合时宜。当一切都准备好了以后，他们不得不等着余上校的到来，他已经派人告诉威廷顿说他希望参加葬礼。最后他在一名副官的陪同下到了。他们向山上走去，六个苦力抬着棺材，来到一小块墓地上，这块地埋葬着沃尔特的前任，死去的那位传教士。威廷顿从传教士的遗物中找到了一本英文祷告书，他用低沉的声音，略带着对他而言不同寻常的尴尬，宣读着送葬词。也许，读着这些庄严但可怕的词语，有种念头会在他脑海中盘旋，下次可能就轮到他作为瘟疫的牺牲品了，却没人能在他的葬礼上为他读悼词了。棺材被慢慢地放进了墓穴，挖墓人开始往上面填土了。

余上校脱帽站在了墓穴旁，戴上帽子后很庄重地对凯蒂敬了一个礼，跟威廷顿说了一两句话后，在其副官的跟随下，大踏步地走了。苦力们好奇地看着这场基督教的葬礼，在一旁逡巡了一会儿，现在也三五成群地，手里拿着抬棺材的轭和抵肩，漫步而去。凯蒂和威廷顿一直等到墓穴被填满，然后又把新鲜的泥土和修女们送来的雅致的大丽花环放到了坟丘上。她并没有哭泣，可是当第一锨泥土撒在棺材上时，她的心如针扎般疼痛。

她看见威廷顿正等着她离开。

“你有急事吗？”她问道，“我还不想回到平房去。”

“我没什么事，我会照你说的办。”





第六十六章


他们沿着山间小路慢慢走着，一直走到山顶，来到牌坊矗立的地方。这个致敬忠贞寡妇的纪念碑占据了凯蒂对此地的大部分印象，它是一个象征，但象征什么她又不知道，也说不出为什么她感觉它有种讽刺挖苦的意味。

“我们能在这儿坐一会儿吗？我们有好长时间没来这儿了。”山下的平地在她眼前延绵开阔，在上午的阳光下显得恬静和安详，“距离上次来这儿也就有几周的时间，可好像过了一辈子那样长。”

他没有回答，过了一会儿她继续让她的思绪漫游，然后叹了口气。

“你是不是认为灵魂是不朽的？”她问道。

对这个问题，他似乎毫不奇怪。

“我怎么知道？”

“就在刚才，当他们给沃尔特擦洗身子，在他们把他放入棺材之前，我看着他。他看上去非常年轻，可惜这么早就死了。你还记得你第一次带我散步时，我们见到的那个死去的乞丐吗？我很害怕倒不是因为他已经死去，而是因为他看上去都没有人形了，像是一个死去的动物。现在，我再一次见证死亡落到了沃尔特身上，他就像个机器突然停摆了，这才是吓人的地方。但如果是机器倒好了，所有的痛苦、酸楚、悲伤都不算什么了。”

他没有回答，但他的眼睛四下浏览眺望着脚下的风景，景色在欢快、阳光灿烂的上午绵延着，让人心花怒放。整齐划一的小块稻田伸展到目光所能到达的远方，在田里，穿着蓝色布衣的农民赶着水牛在勤劳地耕作。这是一片和平、幸福的景象。凯蒂打破了沉默。

“我无法告诉你我在修道院里看到的一切是多么让我感动。她们真是太棒了，那些修女，她们让我觉得自己是多么的渺小。她们放弃了一切，家庭、国家、爱人、孩子、自由，还有所有其他的小东西，我有时想想，这些小东西可能更难放弃，花朵、绿色的田野、秋日里的漫步、书籍和音乐、舒服的生活，她们放弃了一切，所有的东西。而她们为之投入的又是什么呢？牺牲、贫穷、听从吩咐、繁重的工作、祈祷。对于她们所有人来说，这个世界确确实实是个流放之地，生活是她们愿意忍受的十字架，但是在她们的心中，一直都有一个愿望——哦，比愿望要更为强烈，那是一种向往，一种渴望的、充满激情的向往，向往着死亡会引导她们走向永恒的生活。”

凯蒂握紧双手，痛苦地望着他。

“怎么啦？”

“假如没有永恒的生活呢？试想如果死亡真的是万事的终结，那还有什么意义。她们放弃了一切去追求虚无，她们被骗了，她们都上当了。”

威廷顿思索了一会儿。

“我想搞明白，我怀疑她们所追求的东西是否都是镜花水月。她们的生活本身是美丽的。我有一种想法，能够使我们生活的这个世界有可能看上去美丽，而没有任何厌恶的东西，唯一能做的事情就是人们时不时地要在混乱中创造出美的事物，他们画的画，创作的音乐，写的书，以及过的生活。其中最为丰富的美就是美丽的生活，那是完美的艺术作品。”

凯蒂叹了一口气，他的话似乎很晦涩，但她还想听下去。

“你听过交响乐的音乐会吗？”他继续说道。

“是的。”她笑着说，“我对音乐一窍不通，但我还是很喜欢的。”

“乐队的每位成员都在演奏自己的乐器，你认为他们知道在互不关心的气氛中音乐逐渐展开时各部分复杂的和谐吗？他们其实只关心自己那部分，但是他们知道整首交响乐是动听的，即便没人注意听，但它依然是动听的，所以他们只需心满意足地演奏自己的部分就行了。”

“你在有一天曾经谈到了‘道’。”停顿了一会儿，凯蒂说道，“告诉我什么是‘道’。”

威廷顿看了她一眼，犹豫了片刻，随后在他充满喜剧色彩的脸上露出淡淡的微笑，他回答道：

“道就是路和行路人。它是永恒的道路，万物都在沿着它运行，但是，道不是被创造出来的，因为它本身就存在于万物之中。道是一切，又是虚无。从道中万物萌生，万物又顺从道的规律，而且万物最终归于道。它是方形但没有棱角，它是一种声音但耳朵又听不见，它是一种形象但没有形式。道是一张巨大的网，虽然它的网孔像大海一样宽阔，但它不会让任何东西通过它。道是圣殿，在这里万物都可以得到庇护。道是乌有乡，但不用向窗外看，你就能看见它。不管是否愿意，道在教人，让万物按照既定的轨道行进。道把自己变得谦卑，但能够容纳全部。道先弯曲，然后才能变直。失败是成功的基础，成功是失败的蛰伏之地。但谁能说得清不定什么时候转折点就会到来呢？力求温和的人可能会平和如孩童。不卑不亢能够使进攻的人获胜，使防守的人安全。能够征服自己的人才是最强有力的人。”

“道意味着一切吗？”

“有时候是，当我有半打威士忌，边喝边仰望星空时，我认为它或许就意味着一切。”

他们俩又沉默了，还是凯蒂再次打破了沉默。

“告诉我，‘死的是那条狗’，这句话有出处吗？”

威廷顿的嘴角上扬，他已经准备好了答案。但是也许就在那一刻，他有点儿神经过敏，凯蒂没有看他，但她表情中的某些东西使得他改变了主意。

“如果有出处我也不知道。”他小心谨慎地答道，“你为什么这么问？”

“没什么，它突然掠过我的脑海，听起来有点儿耳熟。”

接下来又是一阵沉默。

“当你单独和你丈夫一起的时候。”威廷顿很快说道，“我和军医聊了一会儿，我想我们应该知道更多的细节。”

“什么细节？”

“那名军医处于歇斯底里的状态，我不太明白他的意思，但我能了解到的是，你丈夫是在做实验时被感染的。”

“他总是在做实验。他不是正宗的医生，他是个细菌学家。这也是他急于来这儿的原因。”

“从军医的话中我没有搞清楚的是，他到底是意外被传染上的，还是故意拿自己做实验。”

凯蒂的脸变得刷白，这种说法让她浑身颤抖。威廷顿握住了她的手。

“原谅我再次谈到这个。”他温柔地说道，“但是我以为这会使你得到安慰——我知道在这种场合下，说任何事都是于事无补的——我想这可能对你来说有些意义，沃尔特是为科学牺牲的，是一个以身殉职的烈士。”

凯蒂似乎有些不耐烦地耸了耸肩。

“沃尔特是心碎而死的。”她说道。

威廷顿没有回答，她慢慢地转过身，看着他。她的脸煞白，表情十分坚定。

“他这么说是什么意思，‘死的是条狗’？到底是什么呢？”

“这是戈德史密斯的《挽歌》中的最后一句。”





第六十七章


第二天早晨，凯蒂去了修道院。给她开门的女孩看到她似乎很吃惊。当凯蒂工作了一会儿以后，院长嬷嬷进来了。她走近凯蒂，拉住了她的手。

“我很高兴见到你，我亲爱的孩子。在经过了巨大的悲痛之后不久，你就来这儿工作，让我们看到了你非凡的勇气。但你也是明智的，因为我敢肯定做一点儿工作能够让你远离忧思。”

凯蒂垂下了眼帘，眼圈又红了，她不想让院长嬷嬷看透她的内心。

“我不用告诉你我们这儿所有的人都真心地同情你。”

“你们都太好了。”凯蒂小声地说。

“我们所有人都为你和你已逝去丈夫的灵魂不停地祈祷。”

凯蒂没有回答。院长嬷嬷松开了她的手，用冷冷的、下命令似的口吻给她布置了几项任务，拍了拍两三个孩子的头，冲她们超然、动人地笑了笑，然后又去忙更紧要的事情了。





第六十八章


一周过去了。凯蒂正在缝纫的时候，院长嬷嬷走进了屋子坐在了她的身边。她认真地看了看凯蒂的活儿。

“你的针线活儿真不错，我亲爱的。如今像你这样的年轻女子能做出这么漂亮的针线活儿可真不多了。”

“您过奖了，嬷嬷。”

“我敢肯定你母亲再次见到你一定会很高兴的。”

凯蒂抬头看了看嬷嬷，院长嬷嬷说话的样子可不像出于礼貌跟她随便说说的。她继续说道：

“在你亲爱的丈夫去世后，我还允许你来这儿是因为我想工作可能会分散你的注意力，而且，我认为你也不适合在这个时候长途跋涉自己一个人回香港，我也不希望你独守空房，除了追思你的丈夫无事可做。但现在已经过去八天了，是你离开的时候了。”

“我不想走，嬷嬷，我想留在这儿。”

“你待在这儿没有什么意义了。本来你是和你丈夫一起来的这儿，现在你的丈夫已经去世了，你又怀孕了，过不了多久就需要人照顾了，可在这儿不可能得到关注和照顾。我亲爱的孩子，为了大家的利益，用你的力量去做任何事是你的责任，也是上帝托付给你的重任。”

凯蒂沉默了一会儿，低下了头。

“我一直以为我在这儿还有些用处。对我来说，我特别满意现在的状态，我希望您能允许我继续我的工作，直到瘟疫结束的那一天。”

“我们很感激你为我们所做的一切。”院长带着一丝微笑说道，“但是现在瘟疫疫情正在减弱，来这儿的风险也不是那么大了，我正等着从广州来的修女。她们应该很快就能到了，等她们到了，我想我就不再急需你为我们工作了。”

凯蒂的心沉了下去，院长嬷嬷的口气不容商量，她很了解嬷嬷的为人，知道她再怎么恳求，嬷嬷也会无动于衷的。嬷嬷发现有必要和凯蒂讲道理，所以她说话的语气有所缓和，虽然听上去难免刺激人，至少不是那么专横。

“威廷顿先生也好心地征求了我的建议。”

“我希望他能管好自己的事情。”凯蒂打断道。

“如果他没有这样做的话，我们还是一样会觉得有义务给他这样的建议。”院长嬷嬷柔声说道，“至少在目前，你的岗位不在这儿，你应该和你母亲在一起。威廷顿先生已经和余上校安排好了，派一个健壮的士兵护送你，你在旅途中绝对安全，而且他还安排了轿夫和苦力。女仆也随你一块儿走，在你经过的城市都做了相应的安排。事实上，为了尽量让你旅途舒适安全，大家已经把一切都安排好了。”

凯蒂咬紧了嘴唇，她觉得在事关她自己的问题上，他们至少应该事先征求一下她的意见。她不得不控制住自己的情绪，为了不让回答显得尖酸刻薄。

“我什么时候动身？”

院长嬷嬷仍然相当平静。

“你越早回去越好，先回香港然后再坐船回英国，我亲爱的孩子，我们认为你最好在后天黎明动身。”

“够早的。”

凯蒂觉得有点儿想哭，但是她看清楚了一点，这儿已经没有她的立足之地了。

“好像你们所有人都急于摆脱我。”她难过地说道。

凯蒂意识到院长知道自己的态度后似乎松了一口气，她看出了凯蒂已经准备让步了，但没想到她还能用这么彬彬有礼的口吻来说话。凯蒂是很有幽默感的，她的眼睛眨着，好像在说，即使是圣徒也喜欢自己表达意见的方式。

“别以为我不知道你是个心肠很好的人，我亲爱的孩子，还有你令人钦佩的悲悯之心让你不愿意放弃加在自己身上的责任。”

凯蒂茫然若失地凝视着前方，轻轻地耸了耸肩，知道自己并不具备这些高尚的品德，她想留下是因为实在无处可去。这真是一种奇怪的感觉，好像这个世界上没人在乎她的生死。

“我不能理解你为什么不愿意回家。”院长嬷嬷亲切地追问道，“在这个国度有那么多的外国人，他们不计代价地想得到你这样的运气！”

“但是，他们中不包括你，嬷嬷，对吗？”

“噢，对我们来说情况不同，我亲爱的孩子。当来到这儿的时候，我们就知道要永远地离开家园了。”

出于自己受伤的感情，凯蒂的心头涌现出一种愿望，也许还有点儿敌意，那就是想探究一下对信仰的热爱如何把这些修女变得不食人间烟火，对所有自然的感情都有了超然的免疫力的。她想看看院长嬷嬷身上是否还留有人性的弱点。

“我应该想到有时再也见不到那些对你很亲的人，还有你成长的环境，确实是挺难受的。”

院长嬷嬷犹豫了一会儿，但是在一旁观察她的凯蒂看到，在她美丽和严峻的脸上，那份平静安详丝毫没有改变。

“对我的母亲来说是挺难受的，她现在已经很老了，因为我是她唯一的女儿，在她死之前，她特别希望能够再看我一眼，我也希望能满足她的愿望，但是那是不可能的，我们只能等着在天堂见面了。”

“还是一样，当一个人想到那些自己在他们心目中很重要的人，让这个人断绝与他们的联系还是很困难的，即使这个人这么做是对的。”

“你是在问我是否为自己的行为感到后悔吗？”突然，院长嬷嬷的脸上容光焕发了，“绝不，绝没有，我已经把琐碎、无价值的生活变成了具有牺牲精神、奉献上帝的生活。”

又有了一阵短暂的沉默，然后院长嬷嬷流露出一种更为轻快的态度，笑着说：

“我想托你帮我带一个小包裹，当你到达马赛的时候，把它邮寄出去。我不愿意把它交给中国的邮局寄送。我去取它，马上就回来。”

“你可以明天再给我。”凯蒂说道。

“明天你可能太忙了，来不了这儿了，我亲爱的，我想今天晚上就跟我们道别可能对你更方便些。”

她站起身，带着端庄——这种态度是她宽大的修女服无法遮盖的——离开了房间。过了一会儿，圣约瑟夫修女进来了。她是来跟凯蒂告别的，祝愿她旅途顺利，并安慰她说一路上会很安全的，因为余上校派了一个强壮的卫兵护送她，其实其他姐妹都是自己来的，也没有什么不测。她还问凯蒂喜不喜欢大海，当印度洋上有暴风雨时，凯蒂会不会晕船。她说，凯蒂的母亲大人看到她的女儿肯定会高兴的。她叮嘱凯蒂一定要照顾好自己，毕竟现在她还需要照顾好肚子里的另一个小生命，她们都会为她祈祷的，她自己会不断地为她祈祷，为亲爱的小宝贝祈祷，为可怜的、勇敢的医生的灵魂祈祷。她喋喋不休地、友好而动情地说着。然而，凯蒂深深地感知到圣约瑟夫修女就是一个没有肉体或物质的幽灵。她突然有种狂野的冲动，要抓住这个粗壮的、天性善良的修女的肩膀，摇晃她，大声喊着：“你不知道我是个有血有肉不幸而孤独的人吗，我想得到安慰、同情和鼓励。哦，你就不能有片刻离开上帝给我一点儿怜悯吗，不是那种你给所有受苦众生的基督教的怜悯，而是有人情味的怜悯？”这念头让凯蒂嘴角露出了微笑，圣约瑟夫修女会大吃一惊的！现在她当然会更加确信——原来她只是怀疑——所有的英国人都是疯子。

“幸运的是，我在海上航行什么事也没有。”凯蒂回答道，“我从不晕船。”

院长嬷嬷回来了，手上拿着一个包得很齐整的小包裹。

“它们是些手帕，是我以前为我母亲的命名日[1]做的。”她说道，“名字的首字母是我们年轻的女孩子们绣上去的。”

圣约瑟夫修女建议凯蒂看一下这些手帕有多么的漂亮，院长嬷嬷带着一种宽容的、不以为然的微笑解开了包裹。手帕的材料是上等的细麻布，名字的首字母是用一种复杂的花体字形绣上去的，而且顶上还覆盖着草莓叶的花冠。凯蒂适当地赞扬了手帕的工艺精湛之后，嬷嬷把手帕又包上了，把包裹递给了她。圣约瑟夫修女说道：“好吧，夫人，我们就此别过。”[2]接着又重复着她礼貌和没有什么个人感情的祝愿，然后离开了。凯蒂认识到这一刻她该跟院长嬷嬷告别了，她感谢了院长嬷嬷对她的照顾，她们沿着空无一人的、抹着白灰的走廊并肩走着。

“你到达马赛后，邮寄这个包裹不会给你增加太多的不便吧？”院长问道。

“当然不会，我很乐意效劳。”凯蒂说道。

她瞥了一眼地址，地名似乎是一个很有名的地方，这个地方吸引了她的注意力。

“这个庄园我参观过，我在法国和朋友开车去过很多地方。”

“很有可能。”院长嬷嬷说道，“一周有两天，庄园对外人开放。”

“我觉得如果有幸能住在这么一个美丽的地方，我绝不会有勇气离开它的。”

“当然，它是一个历史遗迹，庄严肃穆。如果说真正让我留恋的，倒不是这个庄园，而是我小时候住的一个小庄园，它位于比利牛斯山脉，我出生在海边，我不否认有时我还想听听海浪拍击岩石的声音。”

凯蒂产生了一种想法——院长嬷嬷在窥测她的想法和说这些话的原因，然后偷偷地取笑她。但是，当她们走到修道院矮小、朴素的大门时，让凯蒂吃了一惊的是，院长嬷嬷把她搂在怀里，并亲吻了她。她苍白的嘴唇压到凯蒂的脸颊上，先是亲吻了一侧，然后又亲吻了另一侧，这大大出乎她的意料，使得她满脸通红，想放声大哭。

“再见，上帝保佑你，我亲爱的孩子。”她把凯蒂揽在怀中好一会儿，“记住，那跟你的责任无关，而是对你的要求，在你手脏时，把它们洗净，不是什么值得称赞的事，唯一值得称道的事是对责任的爱，爱和责任合二为一时，你就有了慈悲，你将拥有一种无以言表的幸福。”

修道院的大门最后一次在她的身后关上了。

第六十九章


威廷顿和凯蒂往山上走着，途中拐了个弯又去看了看沃尔特的墓。在牌坊那儿，威廷顿跟她告了别。最后一次看着牌坊，她觉得自己境遇之中的讽刺之意丝毫不逊于这谜一样的拱门。她迈上了轿椅。

一天天过去了，沿途的景色可以作为她万千思绪的背景，她看见它们好像在一个立体镜中，丰满，而且就像复制品一样，但是，有了附加的意义，因为她看见的每件东西都让她反思。几周之前，她曾走过相同的路线，不过方向相反。苦力抬着她的东西跌跌撞撞地走着。两三个人一伙，一百码远的后面，又有一个人在走着，再后面又跟着两三个。护送的士兵也在跌跌撞撞地走着，一天走个五到二十英里左右，女仆由两个轿夫抬着，而凯蒂因为面子的关系，即使不见得更重，也由四个轿夫抬着。时不时地他们会遇见一长队的苦力，排成一行背负着重物，偶尔也能碰到坐着轿子的中国官员，他们用好奇的目光打量着这个白人妇女。一会儿他们穿行在一群身着褪了色的蓝布衣，头戴大草帽，正赶往集市的农民当中，一会儿他们又会遇见一个年老或年轻的妇女，裹着小脚正蹒跚而行。他们上上下下路过一些小山丘，山的中间是整齐的稻田，还有被一丛丛竹子包围的农舍，恬静惬意。他们经过破破烂烂的农村和人口稠密的城市，城市的四周是城墙，就像一本弥撒书中所描述的那些城市。早秋的太阳是令人愉快的，在天刚亮的时候，阳光闪烁的黎明给整齐的田野施魔法般蒙上了一层童话般的色彩，但天气还是寒冷，随后的温暖让人心存感激。凯蒂心中充满了幸福感，这种感觉她已久违。

生动的景色，雅致的色彩，时常给人意外，宛如一叠异常华丽的挂毯。而在挂毯上，凯蒂的思绪像神秘而黯淡的影子一样晃来晃去。它们全都是不真实的。湄潭府，带着垛口的城墙，就像舞台上的一张油画布，在一出老戏中代表着一座城市。修女们、威廷顿和爱着他的那位满族妇女，都是一场假面剧中的精彩角色。而其他的人，沿着弯弯曲曲街道侧身而行的人和那些死去的人，都是无名的龙套角色。当然，这部剧以及剧中的每个人，都有某种意义，但是意义是什么？好像他们在表演仪式般的舞蹈，精美而古老，你知道那些复杂的举手投足都有一种意义，你要知道这意义，这点很重要，但是你看不到任何线索，完全没有线索。

对凯蒂来说，似乎是不可思议的（一个老妇人穿着蓝色的衣服，正沿着堤道走着，那蓝色在阳光的照耀下如同天青石般湛蓝，她的脸上有着上千条小皱纹，就像老象牙做成的面具，她佝偻着腰，因为她走路的双脚是缠足的，拄着一根长长的黑色拐杖），不可思议的是她和沃尔特也参加了那场奇怪和不真实的舞蹈，他们也都扮演了重要的角色。她可能很容易就失去生命，他已经失去了生命。这是一场笑话吗？也许什么都不是，只是一场梦。她已经从梦中惊醒，如释重负地叹了口气。这一切似乎发生在很久以前，发生在一个遥远的地方。在阳光明媚的现实之前，这出遥远的戏剧里的角色们该是多么模糊难辨。现在对于凯蒂，它就像她正在阅读的一个故事。似乎涉及她的部分很少，这有点儿令人吃惊。她发现已经无法清晰地记起威廷顿的脸了，这张脸她曾经是那么熟悉。

今天傍晚，他们应该到达西江岸边的城市，从那里她要坐上轮船，然后经过一晚上的航行就能到香港了。





第七十章


起初，因为在沃尔特临终时，她没有哭泣，这让她感到羞愧。因为这似乎显得她特别冷酷无情。为什么，那位中国军官——余上校的眼中都一直充满泪水。她丈夫的死让她失魂落魄，很难想象他不会再回到平房的家里了。每天早晨当他醒了以后，她都能听见他在苏州产的澡盆中洗澡，他是活蹦乱跳的，而现在他死了。修女们惊奇于她对基督的顺从，她们钦佩她在痛失亲人时的勇气。但是威廷顿很精明，对于他所有一本正经的同情里面，她有一种感觉——她应该怎么说呢——有点儿言不由衷。沃尔特的死对她的震动挺大，她并不想让他死。但无论如何，她不爱他，她从来没有爱过他，独自忍受悲痛能够让人同情和尊重，但如果让人看透她内心的话，那她的所作所为就是丑陋和下流的了。然而，她已经历了太多，不能自欺欺人了，对她而言，至少最近几周所发生的事好像教会了她这一点，如果有时有必要对人撒谎尚可原谅，但如果对自己也撒谎那就是卑鄙的。沃尔特是以那种悲剧的方式死去，她真的觉得很痛心，但是她这种痛心是纯粹的作为正常人的悲伤，假设这事发生在一个熟人身上，她也会痛心的。她承认沃尔特有很多让人崇拜的品质，但她就是不喜欢他，总是厌烦他，这事确确实实发生了。她不想承认他的死对她来说就是一种解脱，她能很诚实地说，如果她的一句话能够让他起死回生的话，她一定会说的。但是她不能不承认，他的死使得她的生活多少变得轻松一些了。他们在一起时并不幸福，但是分开也很困难。她对自己的这种感觉有点儿吃惊，她想如果人们知道了，会认为她铁石心肠和残忍无情。呃，所幸他们不会知道。她很想知道是不是所有的人在他们心中都有些可耻的秘密，他们会花时间小心守卫，以防别人好奇地窥视。

她没有设想未来，也没做什么计划。她唯一知道的事情就是她待在香港的时间要尽可能地短。她已经可以想象出到达香港的时候一定还惊魂未定。对她来说，她似乎更愿意永远坐在藤条轿子上在怡人的乡村风光里游荡，更愿意作为一个漠然的旁观者永远地观察生活的风云变幻，在另一处屋顶下，度过每一个夜晚。但显而易见的是，她不得不面对不久的将来，当她到达香港的时候，她会去找家旅馆，她会安排人把房子出手，卖掉家具。没有必要去见查理。他应该为了保持颜面对她避而远之，但不管怎么样，她还是想见他一面，告诉他在她的眼中，他是个多么卑鄙的家伙。

但是查理·汤森算个什么东西呢？

一个念头反复地在她的心中萦绕，就像竖琴上一个丰富的曲调，通过一首交响乐复杂的和音，以欢快的、急促的和弦形式回响。就是这个念头给了稻田异国情调的美。一个白白净净的小伙子在驾车赶集的路上，路过她身边时，会掉头看她，他的目光热辣辣的，这个念头使得她苍白的嘴唇会绽放出一些微笑。这个念头给了她所经过城市的纷乱的生活一种魔力。瘟疫肆虐的城市是一座监狱，她从那里逃了出来，她以前从来不知道湛蓝的天空是多么的美，以一种可爱的优雅姿势斜立在堤道上的竹林是多么的惬意。自由！就是这个念头在她的心中歌唱，哪怕未来是多么的黯淡。它是彩虹色的，就像河上的雾气，早晨的阳光照在上面后会变换色彩。自由！不仅是从恼人的束缚中挣脱出来的自由，而且还是一种从压抑的陪伴中解脱出来的自由。自由！不仅是从时刻威胁的死亡中摆脱出来的自由，而且是从使她沉沦的爱情中获得新生的自由，从所有精神的羁绊中获得的自由，是一种不具形体的精神上的自由。有了自由，就有了勇气，无论即将到来的是怎样的挑战，她都会勇敢地面对。





第七十一章


轮船到了香港，停靠在了码头上。凯蒂刚才一直站在甲板上，看着江面上各种颜色、欢快活泼的大小船只来来往往。这时她走进客舱，看看女仆是否落下了什么东西，然后又自己照了照镜子。她穿着一身黑衣，修女们已经为她染黑了一身衣服，但不是孝衣。她想到的第一件事就是检查一下这身打扮。可以说这身衣服虽然不能掩盖住她突然的百感交集，但至少是一个很好的伪装。有人在敲客舱的房门，女仆打开了门。

“费恩太太。”

凯蒂转过身去，看到了一张脸。刚一开始她竟然没有认出来。随后，她的心跳突然加快，脸也红了。来人是多萝西·汤森。凯蒂根本没有想到会看到她，有点儿不知所措了。但是，汤森太太走进了客舱，用一个很冲动的姿势一下子抱住了凯蒂。

“哦，我亲爱的，我是多么为你感到难过呀。”

凯蒂让她亲吻了自己。她有点儿吃惊，原来她总觉得多萝西冷淡而拒人千里之外，可今天她竟然这么情真意切。

“你真是太好了。”凯蒂嘟囔道。

“来甲板上吧，你的女仆会照看好你的东西，我的仆人们也等在这儿了。”

她拉着凯蒂的手，而凯蒂也只好被她领着，但凯蒂注意到她那张温厚的、饱经风霜的脸上确实挂着由衷关心的表情。

“你的船到早了，我差点儿就没接上你。”多萝西说道，“如果我没接到你，我会受不了的。”

“你是特意来接我的？”凯蒂惊呼道。

“当然，我是特意来接你的。”

“但是你怎么知道我要回来？”

“威廷顿先生给我拍了封电报。”

凯蒂背过身去，感到喉咙中有点儿哽咽，一个出乎意料的小小善举竟然如此感动她，真是可笑。她不想哭，她希望多萝西能够走开，但多萝西拉住了凯蒂耷拉在身体一侧的手，并紧紧握住它。这让凯蒂有点儿尴尬，这个颇有城府的女人真够感情外露的。

“我想让你赏光，你在香港期间，查理和我想让你过来和我们住在一起。”

凯蒂把手抽了出来。

“你真的对我太好了，但我想不大可能。”

“你一定要听我的，你不能回去，独自一个人住在你自己的房子里。对你来说，这太可怕了。我已经准备好了一切。你有自己的客厅，如果你不介意和我们一起吃饭，就在我们家吃。我们两个人都希望你能来。”

“我没想回我自己家，我打算在香港宾馆租间房，我不可能去给你添那么多麻烦的。”

多萝西的这个建议起初让她吃惊，现在更多的是让她困惑和烦恼。如果查理还不是那么厚颜无耻的话，他就不应该让她的太太发出这样的邀请。她不想欠他们俩中任何一个人的人情。

“哦，但是想到你住旅馆，我就受不了。你会讨厌香港宾馆的，那儿整天人来人往，乐队一直演奏着爵士乐。请答应来我们家吧，我向你保证查理和我都不会打扰你的。”

“我不知道你为什么对我这么好。”凯蒂一时找不到很好的理由拒绝，又不能简单粗暴地一口回绝，“我恐怕目前在陌生人中间会觉得不太自在。”

“但是我们对你来说是陌生人吗？哦，我真没这样想过，我多么希望你把我当成朋友呀。”多萝西攥紧双手，她冷静、圆滑、特点鲜明的声音中竟然带有颤抖的哭音，“我真的盼着你来，你知道，我想补偿你。”

凯蒂有点儿糊涂了，她不知道查理的妻子欠她什么了，还需要补偿她。

“恐怕我得承认，一开始时，我不是很喜欢你，觉得你很不稳重，你知道，我是个保守的人，而且，我想我还有点儿心胸狭窄。”

凯蒂看了多萝西一眼，这个女人的意思是一开始她觉得凯蒂粗俗，虽然凯蒂脸上没有任何表情，但在心里却笑了。现在她根本不在乎别人对她的看法了！

“可是当我听说你毅然决然地陪着你丈夫远赴生死之地，没有片刻的犹豫，我就觉得自己是个可怕的下流坯，我羞愧极了。你是那么的高尚，那么的勇敢，你让我们所有的人看上去是那么的卑贱和渺小。”这时，泪水似泉水般流淌在她善良、平凡的脸上，“我不能告诉你我有多崇拜你，多敬佩你。我知道无论我做什么都不能弥补你的丧夫之痛，但是我想让你明白我对你深沉、真挚的感情，如果你能允许我为你做点儿微不足道的事的话，将是我莫大的荣幸。不要因为我以前误解了你而对我怀恨在心吧，你是英雄，而我只是个愚蠢的傻女人。”

凯蒂低头看着甲板，脸色苍白。她希望多萝西不要一发不可收拾地倾泻自己的感情。她被感动了，这是真的，但是她忍不住有种微微的不耐烦，这个简单的女人竟然相信了这些谎言。

“如果你实在想让我去的话，当然，我很乐意去。”她叹了口气，不得不让步了。





第七十二章


查理·汤森一家住在山顶的一栋房子里，能够俯瞰大海。一般情况下，查理不回来吃午饭，但在凯蒂到达那天，多萝西（现在只有凯蒂和多萝西两个人）跟她说，如果她想见见他，他愿意赶回来，欢迎她的到来。凯蒂考虑了一下，觉得既然她不得不见到他，还不如马上就见，她怀着好玩的心情期待着看看他见到自己时的窘迫。她看得很清楚，邀请她住在他们家一定是他妻子的主意，即使他心里不愿意，也会马上表示支持的。凯蒂也知道他总是希望能做出正确的选择，而向她发出好客的邀请显然就是一个非常正确的选择。但是他不会不记得他们最后一次充满屈辱的见面，对于查理这样一个虚荣的男人来说，那次会面肯定让他难堪，就像一个溃疡，不会那么快愈合的。她希望自己能够以其人之道还治其人之身。他现在一定恨她，让她欣慰的是她现在并不恨他了，只是鄙视他。一想到他不管内心怎样想，不得不对她重视，尽显好客主人的殷勤，凯蒂就在暗地嘲笑中心满意足了。从那天下午她离开他的办公室的那一刻起，他一定是满心希望，这辈子再也不要见到她了。

现在，她和多萝西坐在一起，等着他的到来。在这个并不是很奢华的客厅里，她能够感受到心情还是很愉快的。她坐在一把扶手椅上，周围摆满了可爱的鲜花，四周的墙上是赏心悦目的绘画作品，房间阴凉舒适，气氛友好，富有家的气息。她内心有一丝战栗，记起了传教士的平房，那里的客厅可以说是家徒四壁，藤椅和厨房的餐桌铺着棉布，破烂的书架上摆满廉价的小说，不够长的红窗帘满是灰尘。哦，真是太寒酸，太艰苦了！她觉得多萝西绝对想象不到。

她们听到一阵汽车开过来的声音，过了一会儿，查理大步走进了房间。

“我晚了吗？我希望没让你们久等，我不得不去见总督，又不能说走就走。”

他走向凯蒂，握住了她的双手。

“我非常高兴你能来这儿。我想多萝西已经告诉你了，我们想让你和我们住在一起，多长时间都可以，而且我们想让你把我们家当成自己的家。我自己也想告诉你，如果这世上有什么事我能帮上你的话，我将不遗余力。”他的眼睛闪烁着迷人而真诚的神情，但她想知道他是否在她的眼中看到了嘲讽，“我对于一些事情的表达，有点儿笨嘴拙舌，我又不想让人把我看成傻瓜，但我还是想告诉你，对于你丈夫的死，我向你表达深深的同情，他是一个非常好的人，我们这儿无数的人会怀念他。”

“别说了，查理。”他太太说道，“我肯定凯蒂能够理解……鸡尾酒来了。”

按照在华外国人奢华的风俗，两个穿制服的男仆端着开胃食品和鸡尾酒上来了。凯蒂谢绝了。

“哦，你一定得吃一点儿。”查理用他一贯的轻松愉快而又显得真心实意的方式坚持着，“吃点儿对你有好处，我敢保证自从你离开香港，再也没有品尝过像鸡尾酒之类的东西了。除非我弄错了，你在湄潭府是搞不到冰块的。”

“你没有弄错。”凯蒂说道。

有那么一刻，她在脑海中闪过一幅画面，那个头发乱蓬蓬，穿着蓝色破烂衣服，透过衣服的破洞可以看见他瘦骨嶙峋的四肢的乞丐，靠着院落的墙壁，他已经死了。





第七十三章


他们一起进餐厅去吃午餐，查理坐在桌子的一头，轻松地掌握着聊天的方向。查理说了一些向凯蒂表示同情和慰问的话，好像她没有受到灾难性的打击，而是刚从上海回来，在一次阑尾炎手术后进行休养。她需要开心，而他就准备着让她开心，让她感觉就像住在自己家里的最佳方式就是像家人一样对待她。他是一个很机敏的男人，他开始谈论起秋天的赛马会，还有马球——哎呀，如果他不能减肥的话，可能就得放弃打马球了——还有今天早晨他和总督的聊天内容。他还谈到了一场在海军旗舰上的聚会，谈到了广州的局势，以及在庐山的各种关系。过了几分钟，凯蒂觉得她好像不过是在周末离开了一下香港。可令人不可思议的是，在另一个国度，只有六百英里远（这距离也就是从伦敦到爱丁堡，不是吗？），男人、女人还有孩子们，就像苍蝇一样纷纷死去。不一会儿，她发现自己开始问这问那了，比如谁在打马球时摔断了颈椎，是否某某夫人已经回故乡了，是否某某夫人正在参加网球锦标赛。查理说着小笑话，而她也以微笑面对。多萝西还是一种高高在上的态度（不过现在她已经把凯蒂看作自己圈子里的人了，所以凯蒂也不再抵触，而是有一种和她是一伙人的感觉），对殖民地的各色人等，有种温和的讽刺。凯蒂开始觉得又有了活力。

“你瞧，她看上去已经好多了。”查理对他太太说道，“在午饭之前，我很吃惊她的脸色是那么苍白，现在她脸上已经有些红润了。”

然而，当凯蒂加入谈话，她注意观察了一下男主人，如果不是显得兴高采烈（她觉得无论是多萝西还是带着令人钦佩的有礼有节的感觉的查理，都不太赞赏这种神情），至少也显得兴趣盎然。过去的这段日子里，在她的想象中他占据着重要位置，所以她脑海中的他的印象十分鲜明。她报复性地想象他浓密的鬈发有点儿太长了，过于精心地梳理过，为了掩盖住头发已经灰白的事实，头发上抹了太多的油。他的脸也太红了，面颊上淡紫色的血管在充血，而且下颌也太大，当他没有略微抬头来遮掩时，可以看见他的双下巴，还有某种像猿猴似的东西在那些像刷子般的、花白的眉毛上，隐约让她感到恶心。他的动作有些迟缓了，他小心翼翼地注意饮食，千方百计地锻炼，也没有阻止他发胖，他的骨头他很留意掩饰，但关节已经显出了中年人的僵硬。他鲜亮的衣服穿在身上也显得太紧，而且显得太年轻了。

但是，午饭之前，当他走进客厅的时候，凯蒂十分震惊（这也可能就是她的脸色那么苍白的原因之一），因为她发现，她的想象跟她开了一个奇怪的玩笑，他一点儿也不像她所描绘的那幅画像，她几乎忍不住要嘲笑自己了。他的头发一点儿也没有变得灰白，哦，在太阳穴旁边是有几根白发，但一点儿也不显眼；他的脸也不红，而是被太阳晒成了古铜色；颈上的脑袋显得很精神，他既不显胖也不显老，事实上，他身材挺拔，令人艳羡——如果他有点儿虚荣，你能责怪他吗？——他应该还是个年轻人。而且，显而易见他懂得如何穿衣，否认这点是荒唐的，他看上去整洁、利索、衣冠楚楚。到底是什么原因才会让她在心里把他想象成这样或者那样？但他依然是个很帅的男人。所幸的是，她知道他是金玉其外、败絮其中的。当然，她必须得承认，他的声音很迷人，他的声音和她记忆中的一模一样，同样也能使他说的不实之词更让人生气。他丰富的语调，温暖的语气，现在还在她的耳畔萦绕，但说的话却是虚情假意，她很纳闷当初怎么把它当成甜言蜜语听进去的。他的眼睛也很漂亮，是他最动人的地方，他的眸子温柔、湛蓝、闪亮，甚至他在胡说八道时，眼中的神情也让人觉得愉快，你几乎不太可能不被它们打动。

最后，咖啡被端了上来，查理点着了他的方头雪茄，他看了看手表，从桌边站了起来。

“好了，我必须留下你们两个年轻的女人去聊你们自己感兴趣的事了。我该回办公室上班了。”他顿了一下，然后用他友好、迷人的眼睛看着凯蒂，对她说道，“我这两天不会打扰你，等你歇过来了，我有点儿买卖上的事要跟你谈。”

“和我谈？”

“你知道，我们必须对你的房产做一下安排，然后还有家具。”

“哦，但是我可以去找律师，没有理由因为这事麻烦你。”

“绝不要有这样的想法，我难道会让你把钱浪费在请律师上？我会去料理一切的。你知道你有权利得到一笔抚恤金，我回去会和总督阁下谈这个事的，看看是否可以和某个适当的部门交涉一下，为你多争取些利益。你的事就是我的事，交给我好了，但你现在还不用操心，我们当下想让你做的事是好好休息，对不对，多萝西？”

“当然。”

他向凯蒂点了点头，然后走过他太太的椅子，拿起她的手，亲吻了一下。大多数的英国男人亲吻一位妇女的手时，看上去都有一点儿笨拙，而他却显得优雅自如。





第七十四章


直到凯蒂在查理家里完全安顿下来以后，她才发现自己真的很疲惫。现在这种舒适的生活和不太适应的安逸让她从过去紧张的生活中走了出来，人一下子松弛了下来。她已经忘了放松是一件多么惬意的事，被周围漂亮的东西环绕是一件多么舒心的事，受到别人的关心是一件多么幸福的事。她如释重负地叹了口气，东方的奢华的一切都好像能轻而易举地获得。用一种审慎、教养良好的形象示人，她成了人们同情的对象，这种感觉也没有什么不好。她在前不久才遭受丧亲之痛，所以也不可能有什么娱乐活动，只是和过来陪她的殖民地的贵妇们（总督阁下的夫人、海军司令和首席大法官的夫人）安静地喝上一杯茶。总督阁下的夫人说，总督阁下急于见到凯蒂，希望她来总督府吃一顿安静的午饭（当然不是午餐会，只有他们自己人和一些副官参加），这次会面一定会很棒。这些贵妇把凯蒂当成了一件瓷器，既价值连城又易损易碎。她能看出来她们视她为一个年轻的英雄，而她也有足够多的幽默，谦逊而又矜持地扮演着这个角色。她有时希望威廷顿能在这里，以他玩世不恭的精明，一定能看出这情景的滑稽，当他们俩单独待在一起时，会好好地大笑一场。多萝西曾经接到过他的一封信，他对凯蒂在修道院里的工作、勇气和自制力极尽溢美之词。当然，他是在很有技巧地逗她们玩，这条狡猾的老狗。





第七十五章


凯蒂发现，不知是有意还是无意，她没有一刻能够和查理单独相处。他圆滑、老到，保持着友善、同情、愉快和可亲。没人能猜到他们曾经有一段超越了友谊的关系。但有一天午后，当她正躺在她房间外的沙发上看书的时候，他沿着阳台走过来，而且停住了脚步。

“你正在读什么？”他问道。

“一本书。”

她嘲弄地看着他，他笑着说：

“多萝西去参加一场在总督府举行的花园聚会了。”

“我知道，你为什么没去？”

“我觉得我受不了那种场合，我想我还是回来陪会儿你吧。车就在外面，你愿意出去环岛兜兜风吗？”

“不了，谢谢你。”

他坐在了她躺着的沙发的一角。

“自从你来了这儿以后，我们还没有机会单独谈一谈。”

她用一种冷冷的目光傲慢地直视他的眼睛。

“你认为我们还有什么要说的吗？”

“很多呀。”

她移动了一下她的脚，以免碰到他。

“你还在生我的气吗？”他问道，一丝笑意挂在他的嘴角，眼神十分柔和。

“一点儿也不。”她笑出了声。

“如果你不生气，我觉得你就不会笑了。”

“你搞错了，我太鄙视你了，都生不起气来了。”

他依然镇定自若。

“我想你对我太苛刻了，冷静地回想一下，说实话难道你不认为我是对的吗？”

“站在你的角度，当然是对的。”

“既然你了解多萝西了，难道你不承认她人真的很好吗？”

“当然，我会永远感激她对我的好的。”

“她是一个百里挑一的人，如果当初我们真的逃跑了，我一刻也不会得到安宁的。那是对她耍了卑鄙的手段，而且，不管怎样，我还得考虑我的孩子们，那对他们的成长会造成可怕的障碍。”

她若有所思地盯着他足有一分钟的时间，觉得自己完全掌控了局势。

“在我来这儿的一周时间里，我仔细观察过你，我得出的结论是你真心喜欢多萝西。我原以为你从来没喜欢过她。”

“我告诉过你我喜欢她，我不会做任何让她感到片刻不安的事情，她是一个男人所能拥有的最好的妻子。”

“你想没想过你曾经对她不忠呢？”

“只要她眼睛没有看到，心里就不会难过。”他笑着说。

她耸了耸肩。

“你可真够卑鄙的。”

“我是个有血有肉的人，我不知道为什么你认为我是个卑鄙的男人，就因为我被你完全迷倒了，我也不是特别想那样，这你是知道的。”

听到他这么说，她的心弦被拨动了一下。

“我也脱不了干系。”她挖苦地回答道。

“当然，我也无法预测到我们会走到这一步境地。”

“不管怎么样，你有一个相当精明的念头，如果有人遭罪的话，那一定不是你。”

“我想你言重了，毕竟现在一切都结束了，你必须看到为了我们两个人，我采取了最好的行动。你失去了理智，而你应该高兴地看到我还是很冷静。如果我按照你想让我做的去行动，你认为可能成功吗？我们当初是热锅上的蚂蚁，我们可能会落个更糟的结局，就是掉到火里。而事实上你没有受到任何伤害，为什么我们不能亲吻对方，再次成为朋友呢？”

她差点儿要笑出了声。

“你不会指望我忘记你曾经把我往绝路上逼，而你丝毫没有内疚之情吧？”

“哦，真是胡说！我告诉过你如果采取适当的预防措施，就根本不会有危险。如果我不是绝对地相信这一点，你认为我会让你去吗？”

“你相信这一点是因为你想相信。你是个懦夫，这种人考虑问题从来只是从自己利益最大化的角度来考虑的。”

“好吧，但事实胜于雄辩，你已经回来了，而且如果你不介意我说的让你不快的话，你比以前气色还好地安然无恙地回来了。”

“那沃尔特呢？”

灵光一现的玩笑话突然到了嘴边，他忍不住笑着脱口而出：

“没有什么比黑色更适合你的了。”

她死盯着他，足足有好一会儿，泪水充满了眼眶，她开始哭了起来。她美丽的脸庞由于悲痛而扭曲了。她并不想掩藏悲痛，只是仰面躺下了，双手摊在了身侧。

“看在上帝的分儿上，别这样哭，我不是想说什么不好的话，那只是句玩笑，你知道我理解你的丧夫之痛，我真诚地为你感到难过。”

“哦，闭上你那张臭嘴。”

“我愿意付出一切换回沃尔特。”

“他的死是因为你和我。”

他抓住了她的手，但她把手从他的手里抽了出来。

“请走开吧。”她抽泣地说道，“那是你现在唯一能为我做的事。我讨厌你，鄙视你。沃尔特比你好上十倍，只是我太傻了，看不到这一点。走开，走开。”

她看出他又要开口说话了，她从沙发上跳起来，进到了自己屋里。他跟着她，当他进来的时候，出于本能的谨慎，他把百叶窗拉了下来，他们几乎处于黑暗之中了。

“我不能让你像这样离开。”他说道，用双手搂着她，“你知道我没有打算伤害你。”

“别碰我，看在上帝的分儿上，走开，赶紧走开。”

她设法挣脱他的搂抱，但是他不松手，她又歇斯底里地哭开了。

“宝贝儿，难道你不知道我一直爱着你。”他用低沉、迷人的声音说道，“我比以前更爱你了。”

“你怎么能说出这么无耻的谎言，让我走，该死，放开我。”

“别对我这样，凯蒂，我知道我一度对你很残忍，但你得原谅我。”

她摇动着身体，抽泣着，挣扎着想摆脱他，但是他手臂的压力有种奇怪的慰藉，她多么渴望他再抱她一次，就一次。她浑身颤抖着，突然觉得非常虚弱，好像她的骨头都融化了，她从为沃尔特感到悲伤转移到为自己感到惋惜上来了。

“哦，你怎么能这样对待我？”她哭着说，“你难道不知道我全身心地爱着你吗？没人爱你像我爱你那样深？”

“宝贝儿。”

他开始吻她。

“不，不。”她喊道。

他想亲她的脸，但是她躲开了；他又想亲她的嘴，她不知道他嘴里在说些什么，都是不成句的、激动的情话，他的胳膊紧紧搂着她，让她觉得就像一个走丢的孩子，终于安全到家了。她虚弱地发出了一声呻吟，眼睛紧闭着，脸被泪水打湿了。这时，他找到了她的嘴唇，把自己的嘴唇压在了上面，她的身体就像过电一样麻，那是一种狂喜，她感觉身体燃烧着，脸涨得通红，就好像完全变了一个人似的。在她的梦中，她曾体验过这种狂喜。他现在正在和她干什么呢？她不知道，她不再是个女人，她整个人已经融化了，只剩下欲望的火焰了。他把她整个人都抱了起来，在他的怀抱中，她变得轻飘飘的了。他抱着她，而她紧紧地贴着他的胸膛，绝望而温顺。她的头陷入了枕头里，他的双唇贴了上去。





第七十六章


她坐在床边，把脸埋在手掌中。

“你想喝点儿水吗？”

她摇了摇头，他走近水池，往玻璃杯中接了一些水，然后端给她。

“来吧，喝点儿水，你会感觉好点儿的。”

他把杯子放到她的嘴边，她抿了点儿水，然后，有点儿惊恐地盯着他。他站在她旁边，俯视着她，眼睛里闪烁着一种满足感。

“呃，你现在还认为我是卑鄙的家伙吗，就像你以前对我的看法？”他问道。

她低下了头。

“是的，但我知道我自己比你也好不到哪里去，哦，我真羞愧。”

“嗯，我觉得你有点儿忘恩负义。”

“你现在就走吗？”

“说实话，我觉得时间差不多了，我得在多萝西回来之前离开你的房间，还要整理妥当。”

他迈着扬扬得意的步伐走出了房间。

凯蒂坐了一会儿，仍然在床边，躬着个腰像个小傻瓜。她的脑袋空空的，一阵战栗传遍全身，她跌跌撞撞地站起身来，走到梳妆台前，一屁股坐到了椅子上。她盯着镜子中的自己，眼睛已经哭肿了，脸也被泪水弄花了，脸颊一边有一个红印子，是刚才他亲的。她用一种惊恐的目光看着自己，同样是这张脸，她原来还指望自己能痛改前非，可现在发现堕落的行为没有改观。

“下流坯。”她条件反射般地摇摆着头，“下流坯。”

然后，她把脸埋在手臂上，凄惨地哭了起来。耻辱，奇耻大辱！她不知道自己怎么了，太可怕了。她恨他，也恨自己。她自己竟然还能欣喜若狂。噢，真可恨！她无法再正视他的脸了，他是对的，他不娶她完全正确，因为她一钱不值，她比一个人尽可夫的妓女好不到哪里去，哦，甚至更坏，因为那些贫困的女人干这一行是为了面包。而在这栋房子里，多萝西在她痛苦无助、处于残酷的凄凉境地时接纳了她，而自己对她做了什么呀！她的肩膀因为抽泣而抖动着。现在一切都过去了，她原以为自己改变了，原以为自己很坚强，原以为自己回到香港后能够找回自我。新的想法在她心里生成，就像小小的黄蝴蝶在阳光下扇动着翅膀，她曾希望自己未来会过得更好，自由就像光的精灵在向她召唤，这世界就像开阔的草原，穿过它时，她可以迈着轻快的步伐，高高地昂起头。她原以为自己已经摆脱了欲望和卑鄙的感情困扰，能够自由自在地生活在纯净和健康的精神世界中。她把自己比拟成了那些黄昏时在稻田上空悠闲遨游的白鹭鸟，它们在休息时也会任由自己的思绪在天空翱翔。她是一个奴隶，软弱，软弱！没有希望，尝试改变也没有什么好处，她就是一个娼妇。

她没有去吃晚饭，让一个男仆告诉多萝西她头痛，想待在房间里。多萝西进来，看见她红肿的眼睛，用她温柔、同情的口吻和她聊了一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事。凯蒂知道多萝西以为她一直是在为沃尔特哭，她像一个善良和可爱的好妻子那样值得同情，自然而然的悲痛应该得到尊重。

“我知道你很难过，亲爱的。”她离开凯蒂时说道，“但你必须设法鼓起勇气，我坚信你亲爱的丈夫也希望你不要为他太难过。”





第七十七章


第二天早上，凯蒂早早地就起床了，给多萝西留了张字条，告诉她自己出去办点儿事，坐有轨电车下山了。街道上汽车、黄包车和轿椅拥挤不堪，她穿过熙熙攘攘的街道、混杂着白人和华人的人流，来到了半岛东方轮船公司的办事处前。一艘轮船已经离开了港口，而另一艘轮船将在两天后启程。她已经下定决心不惜一切代价要坐上这趟船。职员告诉她船舱的每一个铺位都已经预订出去了，她要求见一下负责人。她让职员把她的名字转告了这位负责人，这位负责人她以前见过，亲自出来把她迎进了办公室。他知道她的情况，所以当她告诉他希望能乘下一趟轮船离开的时候，他刚开始觉得有点儿为难。

“我请求您尽量帮帮我。”她向他强烈要求道。

“我想在殖民地没人会不愿意为您效劳的，费恩太太。”他回答道。

他派了一个职员去询问了一圈，然后点头道：

“我打算把一两个人的轮船班次调整一下，我明白您想回家的心情，我想我们应该尽最大努力来帮助您。我能给您安排一个独间的小船舱，希望您能满意。”

她谢了他，兴高采烈地离开了。远走高飞，这是她唯一的念头。马上离开！她拍了一封电报给她父亲，通知了她的归期。她已经给他拍过一封电报告诉他沃尔特去世了。随后，她回到了查理的家，告诉了多萝西她所做的事。

“我们特别遗憾你要走了。”善良的多萝西说道，“但是，我能够理解你想和父母待在一起的心情。”

自从凯蒂回到香港以后，她每天都在犹豫要不要回自己家看看。她害怕再次踏进家门，害怕回忆起过去那些她住在这里时的场景。可是现在她已经别无选择了，查理已经安排出售家具了，也已经找到一个急于续租的人。但是屋里还都是她和沃尔特的衣服，因为去湄潭府的时候，他们几乎没拿什么衣服。还有书、照片和其他零碎的东西。凯蒂对每件东西都无所谓了，只是急于把自己完全和过去的一切切断联系，但她认识到如果把这些私人的东西和其他物品都交到拍卖行里去拍卖，她怕会伤害殖民地上层人们脆弱的感情。所以，这些东西需要打包，然后运回给她。中午饭后，她准备去趟自己的家。多萝西热切地想帮她，主动要求陪她去，但凯蒂请求让她自己独自一个人去，她同意多萝西派她的两个男仆过来帮忙打包。

这栋房子留给了一个管家帮忙照看，他为凯蒂打开了门。她走进自己的房子，但好像一切都很陌生，这真有些奇怪。房间依旧整洁和干净，每件东西都摆在原来的位置，时刻准备供主人使用，虽然天很暖和而且阳光灿烂，但这间静悄悄的屋子里却有种阴冷和荒凉的气息。家具和原来一样呆板地摆放在原处，插着鲜花的花瓶也还在原来的位置，凯蒂倒扣着的书——她都忘记了——依然脸朝下倒扣着。好像这栋房子刚刚在一分钟前被腾空，但时间也就在那一刻定格了，你无法相信这栋房屋中曾经回荡着谈话声和笑声。钢琴上摊开的狐步舞曲的乐谱似乎等待着有人来弹，但是你可能有一种感觉，如果你敲击了琴键，却发现没有声音发出来。沃尔特的房间如同他生前一样整洁，一个橱柜上放着凯蒂的两张大照片，一张是她穿着礼服照的，一张是她的婚纱照。

男仆们从储藏室拿出了箱子，她站在那儿看着他们捆扎打包，他们打包打得整齐利索，凯蒂考虑了两天，她能很轻易地把一切东西都搞定，她不许自己胡思乱想，她没那个工夫。突然，她听到身后有脚步声，转过身去看到了查理。她心里一凉。

“你想干什么？”她问道。

“你能到客厅来一下吗？我有话要跟你说。”

“我很忙。”

“我只占用你五分钟的时间。”

她不再说什么了，只是告诉男仆们继续干手里的活，然后跟着查理走进了隔壁的房间。她没有坐下，为了让他明白别耽误她太久。她知道自己脸色苍白，心怦怦跳着，但还是冷冷地看着他，目光中充满敌意。

“你想干什么？”

“我刚从多萝西那儿听说你后天就要走了，她告诉我你来这儿打包行李，她让我打个电话问问，是否需要我帮忙。”

“十分感谢，但我自己完全能应付得来。”

“我猜也是，我过来不是问你这个的，我过来是想问问你突然决定离开是不是因为昨天发生的事。”

“你和多萝西对我都很好，我不希望你认为我是在利用你们的好心，故意赖着不走。”

“你还没有明确回答我的问题。”

“你觉得那对你重要吗？”

“重要得不得了，我不想是我做了什么事把你逼走的。”

她站在桌子边，低下了头，她的目光落到了《摘要报》上，那是几个月前的旧报纸了，就是这份报纸，沃尔特在那个可怕的傍晚，一直盯着它——而现在沃尔特已经……她抬起了眼睛。

“我觉得自己绝对是堕落了。你鄙视我可能还不如我鄙视自己更甚。”

“但是我并不鄙视你。我昨天说的每个字都是真心的。你何必像这样匆匆跑掉？我不知道为什么我们不能成为好朋友，我讨厌你这样看我，认为我对你不好。”

“为什么你不能让我一个人静静？”

“真见鬼，我不是一块木头或者石头，你对我的看法是没有道理的，是病态的。我以为经过昨天的事以后你会对我更亲近些，毕竟，我们都是人呢。”

“我不觉得自己是个人，我觉得自己像个动物，一头猪、一只兔子或者一条狗。哦，我不能责备你，我也一样坏。我屈服于你是因为我想要你。但那不是真正的我，我不是那个可恨的、兽性的、放荡的女人。我要和这样的女人脱离关系，那不是我——我的丈夫尸骨未寒，而你的妻子又一直对我那么好，别提有多好了——躺在床上为你喘息的人绝对不是我，她是附在我身上的动物，黑暗、可怕得就像恶魔一样，我否认、厌恶和鄙视她，从那时起，每当我想起她，我就会恶心得想吐。”

他皱了一下眉，发出一声短促、不安的笑声。

“好吧，我是个心胸十分开阔的人，但是有时你说的话，真的让我很震惊。”

“我很抱歉这么说。你最好现在就走吧，你是个无关紧要的小人，我这么认真地跟你讲话真是太傻了。”

他一时找不出什么话来回答，她看到他的蓝眼睛里掠过一丝阴影，他对她很生气。他最终还是会去送她，到时会费力地发出一声如释重负的叹息，就同以往一样机智老练，而又彬彬有礼。她一想到他会出于礼貌跟她握手，并祝她旅途愉快，就想笑，她会致谢他的热情好客。但是这时她看到他脸上的神色变了。

“多萝西告诉我你怀孕了。”他说道。

她觉得自己的脸色也变了，但是幸好还是保持了镇定。

“是的。”

“万一我是孩子的父亲呢？”

“不，不，是沃尔特的孩子。”

她忍不住特意做了强调，但是，话说出口后连她自己都觉得欲盖弥彰。

“你肯定吗？”他现在带着一脸无赖般的笑意，“毕竟，你嫁给沃尔特那么多年了，但什么事也没有发生，这日子似乎和我们在一起的日子正对得上，我认为是我骨肉的可能性比是沃尔特的更大。”

“我宁愿杀了我自己也不愿怀上你的孩子。”

“哦，算了吧，你这是胡说，我会十分开心和自豪的，我愿意是个女孩，你知道，我和多萝西只有男孩。谜底很快就会揭开的，你瞧，我的三个孩子和我简直是一个模子里刻出来的。”

他又找回了幽默风趣，她也知道他话里的意思。如果孩子是他的，虽然她再也不想见他了，但她从此再也无法逃避他。他的魔爪始终能够着她，他的淫威虽然看不见，摸不着，但绝对会影响她生活的每一天。

“你是一头最贪慕虚荣的蠢驴，我真是倒了大霉，这辈子撞上了你。”她说道。





第七十八章


当船抵达马赛的时候，凯蒂正在看着崎岖而美丽的海岸线在阳光的照耀下泛着红色，突然金色的圣母玛利亚的雕像映入了眼帘，它矗立在圣母教堂的顶端，作为一种象征守护着大海上水手们的安全。她还记得湄潭府修道院的那些修女，在永远地离开故土的那一刻，如何向着雕像跪拜，当雕像渐渐远去，在蓝色天空的映衬下，变成了一小团金色的火焰，她们又用祈祷来寻求减轻心中与故土家人分别的痛苦。她握紧双手，祈愿某种自己也不知道的力量来支撑她。

在漫长、安静的航行中，她不停地想到发生在自己身上的那些可怕的事情。她都无法理解自己，一切均是出乎意料的。究竟是什么使她鬼迷心窍，尽管她鄙视他，而且全身心地鄙视他，可竟然会激动地半推半就地倒在了他肮脏的怀抱中？愤怒填满了她的内心，对自己的厌恶纠缠着她，她觉得自己决不能忘记这个羞辱，她又忍不住哭了。但是，随着离香港越来越远，她发现自己不知不觉地把原来很清晰的怨恨之情慢慢地淡忘了。她好像是一个突然发了疯病的人，完全失去了控制，恢复了以后，还模模糊糊记得自己荒诞不经的行为，并为此感到懊恼和羞愧。但因为她知道那不是真正的自己，所以在她自己的眼中，至少她可以求得人们的原谅。凯蒂就想，也许宽宏大量的人们可以为她惋惜，而不是谴责她。但当她悲伤地想到自信已经被击得粉碎，不禁叹了口气。原来在她面前的道路似乎伸展得笔直，但是现在她看到的是弯弯曲曲的道路，无数的陷阱在等着她。印度洋无垠的洋面和凄美的日落让她放松了一些，她似乎来到了某个国度，在这里她的灵魂可以得到自由。如果她得经过苦痛的挣扎才能重获自尊的话，那么好吧，她必须找到勇气来面对它。

未来是孤独和艰难的。在赛德港她收到了一封来自她母亲的信件，是对她拍发电报的回复。这封长信是用大号的花体字写成，这种字体是她母亲年轻时，年轻女士们需要学习的一种技能，华丽的字体非常整洁，给你一种不是很真诚的印象。贾斯汀夫人在信中对沃尔特的去世表达了她的哀悼，对她女儿的悲痛恰当地表示了慰问，她害怕凯蒂日后的生活会发生困难，但是殖民地当局自然会给她一笔抚恤金。她很高兴凯蒂将很快回到英国，显然凯蒂也有必要回来和她的父母待在一起，直到她的孩子出生。接下来的话是指导凯蒂在孕期一定要注意的事项，以及她妹妹多瑞丝妊娠期间的各种细节。多瑞丝的儿子出生时又大又重，他的爷爷说，他从来没见过比他更壮实的孩子了。多瑞丝又怀孕了，他们希望最好还是个男孩，好让准男爵的爵位万无一失地继承下去。

凯蒂看出了这封信的要点就是为邀请设定一个确切的日期，即使这个邀请有点儿勉为其难。贾斯汀夫人并不打算为一个处于窘迫境地的、做了寡妇的女儿背上经济负担。真是奇怪，她母亲在小时非常宠爱她，而现在却对她很失望，把她当作了累赘。父母和子女之间的关系是多么奇怪呀！当他们小的时候，父母溺爱他们，每当他们闹点儿小病小灾，父母就紧张害怕得不得了，而孩子们也依赖父母，对他们满是爱和崇拜。多少年过去了，孩子们长大了，一些跟他们没有血缘关系的人，对于他们幸福与否的重要性会比他们的父亲或母亲更甚。冷漠取代了过去盲目和本能的爱。父母与孩子的见面会成为无聊和恼怒的来源。曾经一想到有一个月的分离，他们便牵肠挂肚，而现在他们反而期待多分开几年落得个清净。她的母亲真的不必担心，凯蒂一到英国，就会尽快找地方安顿下来，但是她必须得有点儿时间。目前，一切都不太明朗，她还构建不出任何一个有关未来的规划，也许她会死于难产，那对于很多难题来说倒不失为一种解决方案。

船到了码头，有人把两封信交给了她。她很吃惊，因为认出了那是他父亲的笔迹，他从来没给她写过信，而且不怎么流露感情。信以“亲爱的凯蒂”开头，在信中，他告诉她他代替她母亲给她写信是因为她母亲身体欠安，不得不去一家小型私人医院做一个手术。凯蒂没有感到特别的担心，还是打算通过绕点儿远坐船回家，因为从陆路上走要贵得多，而且她母亲不在家，对于凯蒂待在哈灵顿花园的家中多有不便。另一封信来自多瑞丝，信是这样开头的：“凯蒂宝贝”。倒不是因为多瑞丝对她有什么特殊的感情，而是她对每一个认识的人都这么称呼。





凯蒂宝贝：

我希望父亲已经给你写了信。母亲不得不去做一个手术。她好像去年就不太舒服了，但是你知道她这个人讳疾忌医，而且她一直在吃各种专卖药，我不知道她到底得了什么病，因为她坚持对整个病情保守秘密，如果你问她这方面的问题，她会暴跳如雷。她看上去很糟糕，如果我是你的话，我就会从马赛下船，然后尽可能快地回来。但是不要让她知道我告诉你要赶紧回来，因为她还假装她的身体无大碍，她还想在你到家之前回来呢，她让医生承诺她一周之内出院。

爱你的多瑞丝





对于沃尔特的事，我感到特别难过。你一定度过了一段难熬的时间，可怜的宝贝。我非常期待见到你，我们俩一起怀上了孩子，真好玩，我们可以握握手了。





凯蒂站在甲板上，陷入了沉思。她不能想象她母亲会生病，她记得什么时候看见她都是精力充沛，意志坚强，对别人的头疼脑热总是不耐烦。这时，一个船员过来递给了她一封电报。





非常悲痛地通知你，你母亲今晨逝世。父亲。





第七十九章


凯蒂按响了位于哈灵顿花园父母家的门铃。仆人告诉她，她的父亲在书房。她走到书房的门前，轻轻地把它推开，他正坐在火炉旁读上一期的晚报。当她进来的时候，他抬起头，放下了报纸，吃惊地跳了起来。

“噢，凯蒂，我以为你会乘下一班火车。”

“我想让您不要费事去接我，所以我没有给你拍电报告诉你到达的时间。”

他亲了亲她的脸颊，亲吻的动作她还清晰地记得和以前一模一样。

“我刚才想看看报纸。”他说道，“我还没读最近两天的报纸。”

她看出来了，如果这个时候，他还被日常生活的琐事所占据，他想需要做一些解释。

“当然。”她说道，“您一定累坏了，我想母亲的去世对您的打击很大。”

比起最后一次见到他，父亲更老，也更瘦了。一个矮小、瘦削、枯干的小老头，但仍带着一丝严谨的态度。

“医生说没有任何的希望，她其实已经病了一年多了，但是她拒绝看医生。医生告诉我说，她一定在持续不断地疼痛，他还说她竟然能够忍受下来，真是个奇迹。”

“她从没讲过她的病情吗？”

“她说她觉得不太舒服。但是她没说过疼痛。”他停下来，看着凯蒂，“旅途劳顿，你一定很累了吧？”

“不太累。”

“你想上楼去看看她吗？”

“她在家里？”

“是的，已经从医院拉回家了。”

“好的，我现在就去。”

“你想让我陪你去吗？”

在她父亲的口吻中有某种东西让她觉得奇怪，她很快地看了看他，他把脸悄悄扭到了一边，不想让她看到自己的眼睛。凯蒂最近练就了一项非凡的技能，能够读出别人的想法——毕竟，一天又一天，她已经应用所有识别力来侦测来自她丈夫的每一句随意说出的话或者不带防范的动作，挖出其背后隐藏的想法——她立刻猜到了她父亲试图躲避她的原因。他觉得是一种解脱，一种无限的解脱，自己也吓了一跳。多不容易呀，三十年来他一直是个善良和忠诚的丈夫，他从没说过一个字来指责妻子，现在他应该为她感到悲痛。他总是本本分分地做别人期望他做的事情。但这次作为一个承受着丧妻之痛的丈夫本来应该有的感情他却没有，无论是眨一下眼皮或最微小的举动都背叛了他原来的形象，这让他自己也感到震惊。

“不了，我愿意自己一个人去。”凯蒂说道。

她上了楼，走进一间宽敞、阴冷、俗丽的房间，这是她母亲睡了多年的卧室。她清楚记得那些大号的红木家具，记得墙壁上镶嵌的模仿马库斯·斯通画作的浮雕。梳妆台上的东西都一板一眼地完全按照贾斯汀夫人坚持多年的位置摆放着。鲜花看上去放的不是地方，因为贾斯汀夫人会认为，在卧室里放花是愚蠢的，不健康的，人是会受影响的。花的香气没有遮盖住刺鼻和发霉的味道，就像新洗过的亚麻布，凯蒂记得这是她母亲房间所独有的气味。

贾斯汀夫人就躺在床上，双手交叉放在胸前，一副温顺的样子，而在生前她总是很不耐烦的模样。她的五官棱角分明，脸颊由于疾病的折磨已经清瘦异常，太阳穴也凹陷下去了，但看上去长相依然端正，甚至能让人印象深刻。死亡已经夺走了她的尖酸刻薄，而只留下了她性格中威严的一面，就像一位罗马女皇。凯蒂觉得惊诧，在她所见过的死去的人中，只有她母亲似乎才具有这样的神态，在躯壳上再一次赋予了曾寄居在里面的灵魂。她没有感到悲伤，因为她和母亲之间曾经有着太多的不愉快，她在心里对她没有太深的感情，而且回想她做姑娘时，正是她的母亲一手造成了她今天的样子。但是，当她看到这个一度冷酷、强势和野心勃勃的女人如今未竟夙愿却静静地躺在这里，不免感到一种隐约的伤感。她的母亲聪明一生，算计一世，可没有想到她所追求的不过是些低级趣味和毫无价值的东西，凯蒂怀疑也许在另一个世界里，她母亲看到自己在尘世走过的一生，也会感到惊愕。

多瑞丝这时走了进来。

“我想你会坐这趟火车回来，所以得过来看一下。是不是很可怕呀？可怜的母亲。”

多瑞丝抱着凯蒂放声大哭，凯蒂亲吻着她。她知道母亲喜欢她，往往忽略多瑞丝，而且因为多瑞丝木讷、相貌平平而对她非常苛刻。凯蒂心里想，是不是多瑞丝自己也觉得所流露出的悲伤太过夸张。但是，多瑞丝总是感情外露，也多愁善感。凯蒂希望自己也能哭出来，要不多瑞丝会认为她真的铁石心肠，可凯蒂觉得自己经历了太多的痛苦，无法伪装自己并没有感到的悲伤。

“你愿意去书房看看父亲吗？”她放弃了想与多瑞丝抱头痛哭的努力，问道。

多瑞丝擦干了眼泪，凯蒂注意到怀孕已经使她妹妹的身子显得笨重。多瑞丝穿着黑色的衣服，脸上长着红斑，看着很邋遢。

“不了，我还是不去了，否则我该哭了。可怜的老父亲，他挺坚强的。”

凯蒂把妹妹送出了门，然后又回到父亲身边。他正站在火炉前，报纸整齐地叠着，他想让她看到他没有再读报纸了。

“我还没换吃晚饭的衣服。”他说道，“我觉得没必要了。”





第八十章


他们吃晚饭了，贾斯汀先生详细地跟凯蒂讲了她母亲生病和去世的经过，并告诉她亲友们写来表示哀悼的信件（在他的桌子上有好几摞这样的信件，当他想到还要费事一一回复时，叹了口气），还有他为葬礼所做的安排。饭后，他们又回到了书房，这是这栋房子里唯一有火炉的房间。他机械地从壁炉架上拿起烟斗，开始往里面填烟丝，但他用探询的目光看了女儿一眼后又把烟斗放下了。

“您不抽烟了？”她问道。

“你母亲在晚饭后不太喜欢烟味，战后我就戒了。”

他的回答让凯蒂心头一痛。一位六十岁的老人想在自己的书房里吸烟还得踌躇再三，这好像挺可悲的。

“我喜欢烟草味。”她笑着说道。

一丝放松的表情掠过了他的面庞，他马上又拿起了烟斗，点上了烟。在火炉旁，他们彼此面对面坐着，他觉得必须和凯蒂谈谈她个人的事情了。

“我想你在赛德港一定收到了你母亲的信件，可怜的沃尔特的死讯让我们两个人觉得非常震惊，我觉得他是一个好人。”

凯蒂不知说什么好。

“你母亲也告诉我你已经怀孕了。”

“是的。”

“预产期是什么时候？”

“大约四个月后吧。”

“对你来说，有了孩子可能是一个很大的安慰，你必须去看看多瑞丝的儿子，他真是一个可爱的小家伙。”

他们漫无目的地谈着，好像是初次相遇的陌生人，彼此很客气，似乎他只对她的这些事感兴趣和好奇，他们父女共同的过去，是一堵隔阂的墙横在他们之间。凯蒂心里很明白，过去她没做过一件让父亲对她宠爱有加的事情，他在这所房子里从来没什么地位，他的辛苦被看作是理所当然的，这个养家糊口的人反而有点儿遭到鄙视，因为他无法为家人提供更为奢侈的生活。而且她也认为，因为他是她的父亲，所以他爱她是天经地义的事情，当发现他对她没有什么感情时，她感觉大吃一惊。她知道全家人对他有点儿烦，但从未意识到他也同样对她们感到厌烦。他是那么的善良和逆来顺受，但是她在痛苦中练就的可悲的敏锐让她意识到，虽然他自己可能以前不会，今后也绝不会承认他不喜欢她。

他的烟斗似乎堵住了，他站起身来想找东西捅一捅它。也许这是掩盖他紧张的一个借口。

“你母亲希望你留在这儿直到你的孩子出世，她已经把你过去住的房间准备好了。”

“我知道，我保证不会给您添麻烦的。”

“哦，不要那样说。在这种情况下，很显然除了你父母家，你也没地方可去。但实际上，我刚刚得到了一个巴哈马首席法官的职位，我已经答应就任了。”

“噢，父亲，我太高兴了，我衷心地祝贺您。”

“他们提供这个职位的消息来得太晚了，我还来不及告诉你可怜的母亲。它本来会使她非常满意的。”

真是命运弄人！贾斯汀夫人一辈子费尽心机、苦心经营——虽然屡遭失望之后目标也有所降低——却在最后得偿所愿之前撒手人寰。

“我下个月初出发，当然，这栋房子将交到房产代理人的手上，我打算卖掉家具。我很抱歉，不能让你待在这儿，但是如果你喜欢任何家具，放在一个租来的房间里，你尽可搬走，而且我特别高兴能为你付租金。”

凯蒂怔怔地看着火焰，她的心跳得很厉害。突然，一个念头在她心中一闪，她自己都吓了一跳。但是，最后她还是硬着头皮说了出来，她的声音中带着一丝颤抖。

“我不能跟你一起去吗，父亲？”

“你？呃，我亲爱的凯蒂。”他的脸色沉下来了。她过去经常听到这个称呼，但当时想它不过是个短语，如今她生命中第一次明白了这个亲昵的字眼还能和这样的行动联系在一起，这让她吓了一跳。“但是你所有的朋友都在这儿，多瑞丝也在这儿，我想你要是在伦敦租一个公寓房住会幸福得多，我不十分清楚你的经济状况，但是我很高兴能替你付房租。”

“我有足够的钱生活。”

“我将去一个陌生的地方，我对那里的状况一无所知。”

“我已经习惯了去陌生的地方，伦敦对于我来说没有任何意义，我在这儿都无法呼吸。”

他闭了一会儿眼睛，她觉得他都快哭了。他的脸上挂着一副特别悲惨的表情。这让她心如刀绞，她的判断是对的，她母亲的去世让他充满了解放的感觉，现在他有了这种和过去完全决裂，重获自由的机会。至少经过了这么些年的无所事事，以及始终处于幸福的海市蜃楼之中，他已经看到新生活在面前展开。她依稀看到了他三十年来一直压在心头的痛苦。最后，他睁开了眼睛，情不自禁地一声长叹。

“当然了，如果你希望去，我会很高兴的。”

真可怜，经过了短暂的挣扎之后，他还是向责任感交了械。这些话表明他放弃了所有的希望。她从椅子上站起来，来到他的膝前跪了下去，并抓住了他的双手。

“不，父亲，除非你需要我，否则的话我不跟您去了。您已经牺牲得够多的了。如果您想一个人去，去吧，不要为我考虑一分钟。”

他抽出了一只手，抚摸着她漂亮的头发。

“我当然需要你，我亲爱的，无论如何我是你的父亲，你现在失去了丈夫，一个人孤零零的，如果你想跟我一起去，我不允许的话，那就太不近人情了。”

“但是这就是问题的关键，我不能因为是您的女儿就强求您答应，您不欠我什么。”

“噢，我亲爱的孩子。”

“什么都不欠。”她情绪激动地重复着，“当我想到我们一辈子都是靠压榨您来养肥自己，而没有给您任何回报，甚至没有丝毫的感恩之情，我的心就好像沉到了冰窟窿里。恐怕您以前的生活非常不幸，您难道不让我为过去没有做的事做些补偿吗？”

他皱了一下眉，她的感情让他觉得有点儿窘迫。

“我不明白你的意思，我从来没抱怨过你们什么呀。”

“哦，父亲，我已经经历过那么多事，是那么的不幸，我已经不是离开这儿时的那个凯蒂了，我确实很虚弱，但我已经不是那时的那个卑鄙无耻之人了。您不想给我一次机会吗？我现在在这个世界上没有别的亲人了，只有您了。难道您不想给我机会让您爱我吗？噢，父亲，我是那么的孤单和悲惨，我多么需要您的爱呀。”

她把脸埋到他的膝盖上，哭泣着，好像心都碎了。

“哦，我的凯蒂，我的小凯蒂。”他喃喃地说道。

她抬起头来，双手搂着他的脖子。

“哦，父亲，对我好点儿吧，让我们对彼此都好点儿吧。”

他亲吻了她，在嘴唇上，就像恋人那样，他的脸颊被她的泪水打湿了。

“当然你会跟我一起走。”

“你想让我去？你真的想让我去吗？”

“没错。”

“我太感激您了。”

“哦，我亲爱的，不要对我说那些话了，那让我觉得很尴尬。”

他掏出手绢擦干了她的泪水，他用一种她以前从未见过的方式微笑着，她又一次用胳膊搂住了他的脖子。

“我们将有一只快乐的云雀，亲爱的父亲，你不知道我们在一起会有多么的欢乐。”

“你还没忘记你会有一个宝贝。”

“我很高兴她会出生在一个四面环海、头顶蓝天的地方。”

“你已经确定了孩子的性别？”他嘟囔道，带着一丝淡淡的笑意。

“我想要个女孩，因为我想亲手把她抚养长大，让她不要再犯我曾经犯过的错误，当我回首小的时候，我恨自己，但又没有机会重新来过。我会抚养我的女儿，让她自由自在，能够自食其力。我把一个孩子带到这个世界上来，爱她，把她养大，不是为了让她将来和哪个男人睡觉，从此一辈子依附于他。”

她觉得父亲僵住了，他从来没有说过这样的话，这些话从他女儿的嘴里说出来也让他非常震惊。

“让我这次开门见山地说吧，父亲。我一直都很笨，很坏，很可恨。我也受到了可怕的惩罚。我决定不让我的女儿重蹈覆辙，我想培养她无所畏惧和诚实坦率的品质，我想把她培养成一个不依附于他人，拥有独立人格的人，我想让她自由自在地生活，比我活得成功精彩。”

“怎么啦，我亲爱的，你说起话来像个五十岁的老女人。你还有美好的生活在等着你，不能灰心丧气呀。”

凯蒂摇了摇头，缓缓地笑了起来。

“我没有灰心，我充满了希望和勇气。”

过去的已经过去，让死去的人永远死去吧，这听上去很无情吗？她衷心地希望自己已经学会了悲天悯人。她不知道什么样的未来在等待着她，但是她自信有力量，用轻松愉快的心情来接受无论什么样的挑战。突然之间，她不知道什么原因，从无意识的深处萌发了对过去他们所走过旅程的回忆，她和可怜的沃尔特一起去瘟疫肆虐的城市，在那里他走到了生命的尽头：一个清晨，天依然很黑，他们坐上轿椅出发了。就在刚破晓的时候，她预测到了而不是看到了一个让人美到窒息的景象，在一小段时期内，她心中的痛苦得到了抚慰，这景象把人类所有的苦难都减少到了微不足道的程度。太阳升起来了，驱散了雾气，她看到了蜿蜒的小路一直通向目光所能及的远方，小路就在稻田之间，穿过小河，越过山峦起伏的乡间。他们沿着这条小路走着，也许她做过的所有错事蠢事，她所遭受的种种不幸，并不是完全毫无意义的，只要她沿着这条小路前行。这条她现在能够模糊看清的面前的小路，已经不是善良、滑稽的威廷顿说过的通向乌有乡的路，而是那些修道院里可亲的修女无怨无悔地行于其上的路，一条通向安宁的路。





THE PAINTED VEIL





W. Somerset Maugham





“… the painted veil which those who live call Life.”





PREFACE


This story was suggested by the lines of Dante that run as follows:





Deh, quando tu sarai tomato al mondo,

E riposato della lunga via,

Seguito il terzo spirito al secondo,

Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia:

Siena mi fè; disfecemi Maremma:

Salsi colui, che, innanellata pria

Disposando m'avea con la sua gemma.





“Pray, when you are returned to the world, and rested from the long journey,” followed the third spirit on the second, “remember me, who am Pia. Siena made me, Maremma unmade me: this he knows who after betrothal espoused me with his ring.”





I was a student at St. Thomas's Hospital and the Easter vacation gave me six weeks to myself. With my clothes in a gladstone bag and twenty pounds in my pocket I set out. I was twenty. I went to Genoa and Pisa and then to Florence. Here I took a room in the via Laura, from the window of which I could see the lovely dome of the Cathedral, in the apartment of a widow lady, with a daughter, who offered me board and lodging (after a good deal of haggling) for four lire a day. I am afraid that she did not make a very good thing out of it, since my appetite was enormous, and I could devour a mountain of macaroni without inconvenience. She had a vineyard in the Tuscan hills, and my recollection is that the Chianti she got from it was the best I have ever drunk in Italy. Her daughter gave me an Italian lesson every day. She seemed to me then of mature age, but I do not suppose that she was more than twenty-six. She had had trouble. Her betrothed, an officer, had been killed in Abyssinia and she was consecrated to virginity. It was an understood thing that on her mother's death (a buxom, gray-haired, jovial lady who did not mean to die a day before the dear Lord saw fit) Ersilia would enter religion. But she looked forward to this with cheerfulness. She loved a good laugh. We were very gay at luncheon and dinner, but she took her lessons seriously, and when I was stupid or inattentive rapped me over the knuckles with a black ruler. I should have been indignant at being treated like a child if it had not reminded me of the old-fashioned pedagogues I had read of in books and so made me laugh.

I lived laborious days. I started each one by translating a few pages of one of Ibsen's plays so that I might acquire mastery of technique and ease in writing dialogue; then, with Ruskin in my hand, I examined the sights of Florence. I admired according to instructions the tower of Giotto and the bronze doors of Ghiberti. I was properly enthusiastic over the Botticellis in the Uffizi and I turned the scornful shoulder of extreme youth on what the master disapproved of. After luncheon I had my Italian lesson and then going out once more I visited the churches and wandered day-dreaming along the Arno. When dinner was done I went out to look for adventure, but such was my innocence, or at least my shyness, I always came home as virtuous as I had gone out. The Signora, though she had given me a key, sighed with relief when she heard me come in and bolt the door, for she was always afraid I should forget to do this, and I returned to my perusal of the history of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. I was bitterly conscious that not thus behaved the writers of the romantic era, though I doubt whether any of them managed to spend six weeks in Italy on twenty pounds, and I much enjoyed my sober and industrious life.

I had already read the Inferno (with the help of a translation, but conscientiously looking out in a dictionary the words I did not know), so with Ersilia started on the Purgatorio. When we came to the passage I have quoted above she told me that Pia was a gentlewoman of Siena whose husband, suspecting her of adultery and afraid on account of her family to put her to death, took her down to his castle in the Maremma the noxious vapors of which he was confident would do the trick; but she took so long to die that he grew impatient and had her thrown out of the window. I do not know where Ersilia learnt all this, the note in my own Dante was less circumstantial, but the story for some reason caught my imagination. I turned it over in my mind and for many years from time to time would brood over it for two or three days. I used to repeat to myself the line: Siena mi fè; disfecemi Maremma. But it was one among many subjects that occupied my fancy and for long periods I forgot it. Of course I saw it as a modern story, and I could not think of a setting in the world of to-day in which such events might plausibly happen. It was not till I made a long journey in China that I found this.

I think this is the only novel I have written in which I started from a story rather than from a character. It is difficult to explain the relation between character and plot. You cannot very well think of a character in the void; the moment you think of him, you think of him in some situation, doing something; so that the character and at least his principle action seem to be the result of a simultaneous act of the imagination. But in this case the characters were chosen to fit the story I gradually evolved; they were constructed from persons I had long known in different circumstances.

I had with this book some of the difficulties that are apt to befall an author. I had originally called my hero and heroine Lane, a common enough name, but it appeared that there were people of that name in Hong Kong. They brought an action, which the proprietors of the magazine in which my novel was serialized, settled for two hundred and fifty pounds, and I changed the name to Fane. Then the Assistant Colonial Secretary, thinking himself libeled, threatened to institute proceedings. I was surprised, since in England we can put a Prime Minister on the stage or use him as the character of a novel, an Archbishop of Canterbury or a Lord Chancellor, and the tenants of these exalted offices do not turn a hair. It seemed to me strange that the temporary occupant of so insignificant a post should think himself aimed at, but in order to save trouble I changed Hong Kong to an imaginary colony of Tching-Yen1[1]. The book had already been published when the incident arose and was recalled. A certain number of astute reviewers who had received it did not on one pretext and another return their copies. These have now acquired a bibliographical value, I think there are about sixty of them in existence, and are bought by collectors at a high price.

She gave a startled cry.

“What's the matter?” he asked.

Notwithstanding the darkness of the shuttered room he saw her face on a sudden distraught with terror.

“Some one just tried the door.”

“Well, perhaps it was the amah, or one of the boys.”

“They never come at this time. They know I always sleep after tiffin.”

“Who else could it be?”

“Walter,” she whispered, her lips trembling.

She pointed to his shoes. He tried to put them on, but his nervousness, for her alarm was affecting him, made him clumsy, and besides, they were on the tight side. With a faint gasp of impatience she gave him a shoe horn. She slipped into a kimono and in her bare feet went over to her dressing-table. Her hair was shingled and with a comb she had repaired its disorder before he had laced his second shoe. She handed him his coat.

“How shall I get out?”

“You'd better wait a bit. I'll look out and see that it's all right.”

“It can't possibly be Walter. He doesn't leave the laboratory till five.”

“Who is it then?”

They spoke in whispers now. She was quaking. It occurred to him that in an emergency she would lose her head and on a sudden he felt angry with her. If it wasn't safe why the devil had she said it was? She caught her breath and put her hand on his arm. He followed the direction of her glance. They stood facing the windows that led out on the verandah. They were shuttered and the shutters were bolted. They saw the white china knob of the handle slowly turn. They had heard no one walk along the verandah. It was terrifying to see that silent motion. A minute passed and there was no sound. Then, with the ghastliness of the supernatural, in the same stealthy, noiseless and horrifying manner, they saw the white china knob of the handle at the other window turn also. It was so frightening that Kitty, her nerves failing her, opened her mouth to scream; but, seeing what she was going to do, he swiftly put his hand over it and her cry was smothered in his fingers.

Silence. She leaned against him, her knees shaking, and he was afraid she would faint. Frowning, his jaw set, he carried her to the bed and sat her down upon it. She was as white as the sheet and notwithstanding his tan his cheeks were pale too. He stood by her side looking with fascinated gaze at the china knob. They did not speak. Then he saw that she was crying.

“For God's sake don't do that,” he whispered irritably. “If we're in for it we're in for it. We shall just have to brazen it out.”

She looked for her handkerchief and knowing what she wanted he gave her her bag.

“Where's your topee?”

“I left it downstairs.”

“Oh, my God!”

“I say, you must pull yourself together. It's a hundred to one it wasn't Walter. Why on earth should he come back at this hour? He never does come home in the middle of the day, does he?”

“Never.”

“I'll bet you anything you like it was amah.”

She gave him the shadow of a smile. His rich, caressing voice reassured her and she took his hand and affectionately pressed it. He gave her a moment to collect herself.

“Look here, we can't stay here for ever,” he said then. “Do you feel up to going out on the verandah and having a look?”

“I don't think I can stand.”

“Have you got any brandy in here?”

She shook her head. A frown for an instant darkened his brow, he was growing impatient, he did not quite know what to do. Suddenly she clutched his hand more tightly.

“Suppose he's waiting there?”

He forced his lips to smile and his voice retained the gentle, persuasive tone the effect of which he was so fully conscious of.

“That's not very likely. Have a little pluck, Kitty. How can it possibly be your husband? If he'd come in and seen a strange topee in the hall and come upstairs and found your room locked, surely he would have made some sort of row. It must have been one of the servants. Only a Chinese would turn a handle in that way.”

She did feel more herself now.

“It's not very pleasant even if it was only the amah.”

“She can be squared and if necessary I'll put the fear of God into her. There are not many advantages in being a government official, but you may as well get what you can out of it.”

He must be right. She stood up and turning to him stretched out her arms: he took her in his and kissed her on the lips. It was such rapture that it was pain. She adored him. He released her and she went to the window. She slid back the bolt and opening the shutter a little looked out. There was not a soul. She slipped on to the verandah, looked into her husband's dressing-room and then into her own sitting-room. Both were empty. She went back to the bedroom and beckoned to him.

“Nobody.”

“I believe the whole thing was an optical delusion.”

“Don't laugh. I was terrified. Go into my sitting-room and sit down. I'll put on my stockings and some shoes.”

He did as she bade and in five minutes she joined him. He was smoking a cigarette.

“I say, could I have a brandy and soda?”

“Yes, I'll ring.”

“I don't think it would hurt you by the look of things.”

They waited in silence for the boy to answer. She gave the order.

“Ring up the laboratory and ask if Walter is there,” she said then. “They won't know your voice.”

He took up the receiver and asked for the number. He inquired whether Dr. Fane was in. He put down the receiver.

“He hasn't been in since tiffin,” he told her. “Ask the boy whether he has been here.”

“I daren't. It'll look so funny if he has and I didn't see him.”

The boy brought the drinks and Townsend helped himself. When he offered her some she shook her head.

“What's to be done if it was Walter?” she asked.

“Perhaps he wouldn't care.”

“Walter?”

Her tone was incredulous.

“It's always struck me he was rather shy. Some men can't bear scenes, you know. He's got sense enough to know that there's nothing to be gained by making a scandal. I don't believe for a minute it was Walter, but even if it was, my impression is that he'll do nothing. I think he'll ignore it.”

She reflected for a moment.

“He's awfully in love with me.”

“Well, that's all to the good. You'll get round him.”

He gave her that charming smile of his which she had always found so irresistible. It was a slow smile which started in his clear blue eyes and travelled by perceptible degrees to his shapely mouth. He had small white even teeth. It was a very sensual smile and it made her heart melt in her body.

“I don't very much care,” she said, with a flash of gaiety. “It was worth it.”

“It was my fault.”

“Why did you come? I was amazed to see you.”

“I couldn't resist it.”

“You dear.”

She leaned a little towards him, her dark and shining eyes gazing passionately into his, her mouth a little open with desire, and he put his arms round her. She abandoned herself with a sigh of ecstasy to their shelter.

“You know you can always count on me.” he said.

“I'm so happy with you. I wish I could make you as happy as you make me.”

“You're not frightened any more?”

“I hate Walter,” she answered.

He did not quite know what to say to this, so he kissed her. Her face was very soft against his.

But he took her wrist on which was a little gold watch and looked at the time.

“Do you know what I must do now?”

“Bolt?” she smiled.

He nodded. For one instant she clung to him more closely, but she felt his desire to go, and she released him.

“It's shameful the way you neglect your work. Be off with you.”

He could never resist the temptation to flirt.

“You seem in a devil of a hurry to get rid of me,” he said lightly.

“You know that I hate to let you go.”

Her answer was low and deep and serious. He gave a flattered laugh.

“Don't worry your pretty little head about our mysterious visitor. I'm quite sure it was the amah. And if there's any trouble I guarantee to get you out of it.”

“Have you had a lot of experience?”

His smile was amused and complacent.

“No, but I flatter myself that I've got a head screwed on my shoulders.”

She went out on to the verandah and watched him leave the house. He waved his hand to her. It gave her a little thrill as she looked at him; he was forty-one, but he had the lithe figure and the springing step of a boy.

The verandah was in shadow; and lazily, her heart at ease with satisfied love, she lingered. Their house stood in the Happey Valley, on the side of the hill, for they could not afford to live on the more eligible but expensive Peak. But her abstracted gaze scarcely noticed the blue sea and the crowded shipping in the harbour. She could think only of her lover.

Of course it was stupid to behave as they had done that afternoon, but if he wanted her how could she be prudent? He had come two or three times after tiffin, when in the heat of the day no one thought of stirring out, and not even the boys had seen him come and go. It was very difficult at Hong Kong. She hated the Chinese city and it made her nervous to go into the filthy little house off the Victoria Road in which they were in the habit of meeting. It was a curio dealer's; and the Chinese who were sitting about stared at her unpleasantly; she hated the ingratiating smile of the old man who took her to the back of the shop and then up a dark flight of stairs. The room into which he led her was frowsy and the large wooden bed against the wall made her shudder.

“This is dreadfully sordid, isn't it?” she said to Charlie the first time she met him there.

“It was till you came in,” he answered,

Of course the moment he took her in his arms she forgot everything.

Oh, how hateful it was that she wasn't free, that they both weren't free! She didn't like his wife. Kitty's wandering thoughts dwelt now for a moment on Dorothy Townsend. How unfortunate to be called Dorothy! It dated you. She was thirty-eight at least. But Charlie never spoke of her. Of course he didn't care for her; she bored him to death. But he was a gentleman. Kitty smiled with affectionate irony: it was just like him, silly old thing; he might be unfaithful to her, but he would never allow a word in disparagement of her to cross his lips. She was a tallish woman, taller than Kitty, neither stout nor thin, with a good deal of pale brown hair; she could never have been pretty with anything but the prettiness of youth; her features were good enough without being remarkable and her blue eyes were cold. She had a skin that you would never look at twice and no color in her cheeks. And she dressed like--well, like what she was, the wife of the Assistant Colonial Secretary at Hong Kong. Kitty smiled and gave her shoulders a faint shrug.

Of course no one could deny that Dorothy Townsend had a pleasant voice. She was a wonderful mother, Charlie always said that of her, and she was what Kitty's mother called a gentlewoman. But Kitty did not like her. She did not like her casual manner; and the politeness with which she treated you when you went there, to tea or dinner, was exasperating because you could not but feel how little interest she took in you. The fact was, Kitty supposed, that she cared for nothing but her children: there were two boys at school in England, and another boy of six whom she was going to take home next year. Her face was a mask. She smiled and in her pleasant, well-mannered way said the things that were expected of her; but for all her cordiality held you at a distance. She had a few intimate friends in the Colony and they greatly admired her. Kitty wondered whether Mrs. Townsend thought her a little common. She flushed. After all there was no reason for her to put on airs. It was true that her father had been a Colonial Governor and of course it was very grand while it lasted--every one stood up when you entered a room and men took off their hats to you as you passed in your car--but what could be more insignificant than a Colonial Governor when he had retired? Dorothy Townsend's father lived on a pension in a small house at Earl's Court. Kitty's mother would think it a dreadful bore if she asked her to call. Kitty's father, Bernard Garstin, was a K.C. and there was no reason why he should not be made a judge one of these days. Anyhow they lived in South Kensington.

Kitty, coming to Hong Kong on her marriage, had found it hard to reconcile herself to the fact that her social position was determined by her husband's occupation. Of course everyone had been very kind and for two or three months they had gone out to parties almost every night; when they dined at Government House the Governor took her in as a bride; but she had understood quickly that as the wife of the Government bacteriologist she was of no particular consequence. It made her angry.

“It's too absurd,” she told her husband. “Why, there's hardly any one here that one would bother about for five minutes at home. Mother wouldn't dream of asking any of them to dine at our house.”

“You mustn't let it worry you,” he answered. “It doesn't really matter, you know.”

“Of course it doesn't matter, it only shows how stupid they are, but it is rather funny when you think of all the people who used to come to our house at home that here we should be treated like dirt.”

“From a social standpoint the man of science does not exist,” he smiled.

She knew that now, but she had not known it when she married him.

“I don't know that it exactly amuses me to be taken in to dinner by the agent of the P. and O.,” she said, laughing in order that what she said might not seem snobbish.

Perhaps he saw the reproach behind her lightness of manner, for he took her hand and shyly pressed it.

“I'm awfully sorry, Kitty dear, but don't let it vex you.”

“Oh. I'm not going to let it do that.”

It couldn't have been Walter that afternoon. It must have been one of the servants and after all they didn't matter. Chinese servants knew everything anyway. But they held their tongues.

Her heart beat a little faster as she remembered the way in which that white china knob slowly turned. They mustn't take risks like that again. It was better to go to the curio shop. No one who saw her go in would think anything of it, and they were absolutely safe there. The owner of the shop knew who Charlie was and he was not such a fool as to put up the back of the Assistant Colonial Secretary. What did anything matter really but that Charlie loved her?

She turned away from the verandah and went back into her sitting-room. She threw herself down on the sofa and stretched out her hand to get a cigarette. Her eye caught sight of a note lying on the top of a book. She opened it. It was written in pencil.





Dear Kitty,

Here is the book you wanted. I was just going to send it when I met Dr. Fane and he said he'd bring it round himself as he was passing the house.

V. H.





She rang the bell and when the boy came asked him who had brought the book and when.

“Master bring it, missy, after tiffin,” he answered.

Then it had been Walter. She rang up the Colonial Secretary's Office at once and asked for Charlie. She told him what she had just learned. There was a pause before he answered.

“What shall I do?” she asked.

“I'm in the middle of an important consultation. I'm afraid I can't talk to you now. My advice to you is to sit tight.”

She put down the receiver. She understood that he was not alone and she was impatient with his business.

She sat down again, at a desk, and resting her face in her hands sought to think out the situation. Of course Walter might merely have thought she was sleeping: there was no reason why she should not lock herself in. She tried to remember if they had been talking. Certainly they had not been talking loud. And there was the hat. It was maddening of Charlie to have left it downstairs. But it was no use blaming him for that, it was natural enough, and there was nothing to tell that Walter had noticed it. He was probably in a hurry and had just left the book and note on his way to some appointment connected with his work. The strange thing was that he should have tried the door and then the two windows. If he thought she was asleep it was unlike him to disturb her. What a fool she had been!

She shook herself a little and again she felt that sweet pain in her heart which she always felt when she thought of Charlie. It had been worth it. He had said that he would stand by her, and if the worst came to the worst, well… Let Walter kick up a row if he chose. She had Charlie; what did she care? Perhaps it would be the best thing for him to know. She had never cared for Walter and since she had loved Charlie Townsend it had irked and bored her to submit to her husband's caresses. She wanted to have nothing more to do with him. She didn't see how he could prove anything. If he accused her she would deny, and if it came to a pass that she could deny no longer, well, she would fling the truth in his teeth, and he could do what he chose.

Within three months of her marriage she knew that she had made a mistake; but it had been her mother's fault even more than hers.

There was a photograph of her mother in the room and Kitty's harassed eyes fell on it. She did not know why she kept it there, for she was not very fond of her mother; there was one of her father too, but that was downstairs on the grand piano. It had been done when he took silk and it represented him in a wig and gown. Even they could not make him imposing; he was a little, wizened man, with tired eyes, a long upper lip, and a thin mouth; a facetious photographer had told him to look pleasant, but he had succeeded only in looking severe. It was on this account, for as a rule the down-turned corners of his mouth and the dejection of his eyes gave him an air of mild depression, that Mrs. Garstin, thinking it made him look judicial, had chosen it from among the proofs. But her own photograph showed her in the dress in which she had gone to Court when her husband was made a King's Counsel. She was very grand in the velvet gown, the long train so disposed as to show to advantage, with feathers in her hair and flowers in her hand. She held herself erect. She was a woman of fifty, thin and flat-chested, with prominent cheek-bones and a large, well-shaped nose. She had a great quantity of very smooth black hair and Kitty had always suspected that, if not dyed, it was at least touched up. Her fine black eyes were never still and this was the most noticeable thing about her; for when she was talking to you it was disconcerting to see those restless eyes in that impassive, unlined and yellow face. They moved from one part of you to another, to other persons in the room, and then back to you; you felt that she was criticising you, summing you up, watchful meanwhile of all that went on around her, and that the words she spoke had no connection with her thoughts.

Mrs. Garstin was a hard, cruel, managing, ambitious, par-simonious and stupid woman. She was the daughter, one of five, of a solicitor in Liverpool and Bernard Garstin had met her when he was on the Northern Circuit. He had seemed then a young man of promise and her father said he would go far. He hadn't. He was painstaking, industrious and capable, but he had not the will to advance himself. Mrs. Garstin despised him. But she recognised, though with bitterness, that she could only achieve success through him, and she set herself to drive him on the way she desired to go. She nagged him without mercy. She discovered that if she wanted him to do something which his sensitiveness revolted against she had only to give him no peace and eventually, exhausted, he would yield. On her side she set herself to cultivate the people who might be useful. She flattered the solicitors who would send her husband briefs and was familiar with their wives. She was obsequious to the judges and their ladies. She made much of promising politicians.

In twenty-five years Mrs. Garstin never invited any one to dine at her house because she liked him. She gave large dinner parties at regular intervals. But parsimony was as strong in her as ambition. She hated to spend money. She flattered herself that she could make as much show as any one else at half the price. Her dinners were long and elaborate, but thrifty, and she could never persuade herself that people when they were eating and talking knew what they drank. She wrapped sparkling Moselle in a napkin and thought her guests took it for champagne.

Bernard Garstin had a fair, though not a large practice. Men who had been called after him had long outstripped him. Mrs. Garstin made him stand for parliament. The expense of the election was borne by the party, but here again her parsimony balked her ambition, and she could not bring herself to spend enough money to nurse the constituency. The subscriptions Bernard Garstin made to the innumerable funds a candidate is expected to contribute to were always just a little less than adequate. He was beaten. Though it would have pleased Mrs. Garstin to be a member's wife she bore her disappointment with fortitude. The fact of her husband's standing had brought her in contact with a number of prominent persons and she appreciated the addition to her social consequence. She knew that Bernard would never make his mark in the House. She wanted him to be a member only that he might have a claim on the gratitude of his party and surely to fight two or three losing seats would give him that.

But he was still a junior and many younger men than he had already taken silk. It was necessary that he should too, not only because otherwise he could scarcely hope to be made a judge, but on her account also; it mortified her to go into dinner after women ten years younger than herself. But here she encountered in her husband an obstinacy which she had not for years been accustomed to. He was afraid that as a K.C. he would get no work. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, he told her, to which she retorted that a proverb was the last refuge of the mentally destitute. He suggested to her the possibility that his income would be halved and he knew that there was no argument which could have greater weight with her. She would not listen. She called him pusillanimous. She gave him no peace and at last, as always, he yielded. He applied for silk and it was promptly awarded him.

His misgivings were justified. He made no headway as a leader and his briefs were few. But he concealed any disappointment he may have felt, and if he reproached his wife it was in his heart. He grew perhaps a little more silent, but he had always been silent at home, and no one in his family noticed a change in him. His daughters had never looked upon him as anything but a source of income; it had always seemed perfectly natural that he should lead a dog's life in order to provide them with board and lodging, clothes, holidays, and money for odds and ends; and now, understanding that through his fault money was less plentiful, the indifference they had felt for him was tinged with an exasperated contempt. It never occurred to them to ask themselves what were the feelings of the subdued little man who went out early in the morning and came home at night only in time to dress for dinner. He was a stranger to them, but because he was their father they took it for granted that he should love and cherish them.

But there was a quality of courage in Mrs. Garstin which in itself was admirable. She let no one in her immediate circle, which to her was the world, see how mortified she was by the frustration of her hopes. She made no change in her style of living. By careful management she was able to give as showy dinners as she had done before, and she met her friends with the same bright gaiety which she had so long cultivated. She had a hard and facile fund of chit-chat which in the society she moved in passed for conversation. She was a useful guest among persons to whom small talk did not come easily, for she was never at a loss with a new topic and could be trusted immediately to break an awkward silence with a suitable observation.

It was unlikely now that Bernard Garstin would ever be made a judge of the High Court, but he might still hope for a County Court judgeship or at the worst an appointment in the Colonies. Meanwhile she had the satisfaction of seeing him appointed Recorder of a Welsh town. But it was on her daughters that she set her hopes. By arranging good marriages for them she expected to make up for all the disappointments of her career. There were two, Kitty and Doris. Doris gave no sign of good looks, her nose was too long and her figure was lumpy; so that Mrs. Garstin could hope no more for her than that she should marry a young man who was well off in a suitable profession.

But Kitty was a beauty. She gave promise of being so when she was still a child, for she had large, dark eyes, liquid and vivacious, brown, curling hair in which there was a reddish tint, exquisite teeth and a lovely skin. Her features would never be very good, for her chin was too square and her nose, though not so long as Doris's, too big. Her beauty depended a good deal on her youth, and Mrs. Garstin realised that she must marry in the first flush of her maidenhood. When she came out she was dazzling: her skin was still her greatest beauty, but her eyes with their long lashes were so starry and yet so melting that it gave you a catch at the heart to look into them. She had a charming gaiety and the desire to please. Mrs. Garstin bestowed upon her all the affection, a harsh, competent, calculating affection, of which she was capable; she dreamed ambitious dreams; it was not a good marriage she aimed at for her daughter, but a brilliant one.

Kitty had been brought up with the knowledge that she was going to be a beautiful woman and she more than suspected her mother's ambition. It accorded with her own desires. She was launched upon the world and Mrs. Garstin performed prodigies in getting herself invited to dances where her daughter might meet eligible men. Kitty was a success. She was amusing as well as beautiful, and very soon she had a dozen men in love with her. But none was suitable, and Kitty, charming and friendly with all, took care to commit herself with none. The drawing-room in South Kensington was filled on Sunday afternoons with amorous youth, but Mrs. Garstin observed, with a grim smile of approval, that it needed no effort on her part to keep them at a distance from Kitty. Kitty was prepared to flirt with them, and it diverted her to play one off against the other, but when they proposed to her, as none failed to do, she refused them with tact but decision.

Her first season passed without the perfect suitor presenting himself, and the second also; but she was young and could afford to wait. Mrs. Garstin told her friends that she thought it a pity for a girl to marry till she was twenty-one. But a third year passed and then a fourth. Two or three of her old admirers proposed again, but they were still penniless, one or two boys younger than herself proposed; a retired Indian Civilian, a K.C.I.E., did the same: he was fifty-three. Kitty still danced a great deal, she went to Wimbledon and Lord's, to Ascot and Henley; she was thoroughly enjoying herself; but still no one whose position and income were satisfactory asked her to marry him. Mrs. Garstin began to grow uneasy. She noticed that Kitty was beginning to attract men of forty and over. She reminded her that she would not be any longer so pretty in a year or two and that young girls were coming out all the time. Mrs. Garstin did not mince her words in the domestic circle and she warned her daughter tartly that she would miss her market.

Kitty shrugged her shoulders. She thought herself as pretty as ever, prettier perhaps, for she had learnt how to dress in the last four years, and she had plenty of time. If she wanted to marry just to be married there were a dozen boys who would jump at the chance. Surely the right man would come along sooner or later. But Mrs. Garstin judged the situation more shrewdly: with anger in her heart for the beautiful daughter who had missed her chances she set her standard a little lower. She turned back to the professional class at which she had sneered in her pride and looked about for a young lawyer or a business man whose future inspired her with confidence.

Kitty reached the age of twenty-five and was still unmarried. Mrs. Garstin was exasperated and she did not hesitate often to give Kitty a piece of her very unpleasant mind. She asked her how much longer she expected her father to support her. He had spent sums he could ill afford in order to give her a chance and she had not taken it. It never struck Mrs. Garstin that perhaps her own hard affability had frightened the men, sons of wealthy fathers or heirs to a title, whose visits she had too cordially encouraged. She put down Kitty's failure to stupidity. Then Doris came out. She had a long nose still, and a poor figure, and she danced badly. In her first season she became engaged to Geoffrey Dennison. He was the only son of a prosperous surgeon who had been given a baronetcy during the war. Geoffrey would inherit a title--it is not very grand to be a medical baronet, but a title, thank God, is still a title--and a very comfortable fortune.

Kitty in a panic married Walter Fane.

She had known him but a little while and had never taken much notice of him. She had no idea when or where they had first met till after their engagement he told her that it was at a dance to which some friends had brought him. She certainly paid no attention to him then and if she danced with him it was because she was good-natured and was glad to dance with any one who asked her. She didn't know him from Adam when a day or two later at another dance he came up and spoke to her. Then she remarked that he was at every dance she went to.

“You know, I've danced with you at least a dozen times now and you must tell me your name,” she said to him at last in her laughing way.

He was obviously taken aback.

“Do you mean to say you don't know it? I was introduced to you.”

“Oh, but people always mumble. I shouldn't be at all surprised if you hadn't the ghost of an idea what mine was.”

He smiled at her. His face was grave and a trifle stern, but his smile was very sweet.

“Of course I know it.” He was silent for a moment or two. “Have you no curiosity?” he asked then.

“As much as most women.”

“It didn't occur to you to ask somebody or other what my name was?”

She was faintly amused; she wondered why he thought it could in the least interest her; but she liked to please, so she looked at him with that dazzling smile of hers and her beautiful eyes, dewy ponds under forest trees, held an enchanting kindness.

“Well, what is it?”

“Walter Fane.”

She did not know why he came to dances, he did not dance very well, and he seemed to know few people. She had a passing thought that he was in love with her; but she dismissed it with a shrug of the shoulders: she had known girls who thought every man they met was in love with them and had always found them absurd. But she gave Walter Fane just a little more of her attention. He certainly did not behave like any of the other youths who had been in love with her. Most of them told her so frankly and wanted to kiss her: a good many did. But Walter Fane never talked of her and very little of himself. He was rather silent; she did not mind that because she had plenty to say and it pleased her to see him laugh when she made a facetious remark; but when he talked it was not stupidly. He was evidently shy. It appeared that he lived in the East and was home on leave.

One Sunday afternoon he appeared at their house in South Kensington. There were a dozen people there, and he sat for some time, somewhat ill at ease, and then went away. Her mother asked her later who he was.

“I haven't a notion. Did you ask him to come here?”

“Yes, I met him at the Baddeleys. He said he'd seen you at various dances. I said I was always at home on Sundays.”

“His name is Fane and he's got some sort of job in the East.”

“Yes, he's a doctor. Is he in love with you?”

“Upon my word, I don't know.”

“I should have thought you knew by now when a young man was in love with you.”

“I wouldn't marry him if he were,” said Kitty lightly.

Mrs. Garstin did not answer. Her silence was heavy with displeasure. Kitty flushed: she knew that her mother did not care now whom she married so long as somehow she got her off her hands.

During the next week she met him at three dances and now, his shyness perhaps wearing off a little, he was somewhat more communicative. He was a doctor, certainly, but he did not practise; he was a bacteriologist (Kitty had only a very vague idea what that meant) and he had a job at Hong Kong. He was going back in the autumn. He talked a good deal about China. She made it a practice to appear interested in whatever people talked to her of, but indeed the life in Hong Kong sounded quite jolly; there were clubs and tennis and racing and polo and golf.

“Do people dance much there?”

“Oh, yes, I think so.”

She wondered whether he told her these things with a motive. He seemed to like her society, but never by a pressure of the hand, by a glance or by a word, did he give the smallest indication that he looked upon her as anything but a girl whom you met and danced with. On the following Sunday he came again to their house. Her father happened to come in, it was raining and he had not been able to play golf, and he and Walter Fane had a long chat. She asked her father afterwards what they had talked of.

“It appears he's stationed at Hong Kong. The Chief Justice is an old friend of mine at the Bar. He seems an unusually intelligent young man.”

She knew that her father was as a rule bored to death by the young people whom for her sake and now her sister's he had been forced for years to entertain.

“It's not often you like any of my young men, father,” she said.

His kind, tired eyes rested upon her.

“Are you going to marry him by any chance?”

“Certainly not.”

“Is he in love with you?”

“He shows no sign of it.”

“Do you like him?”

“I don't think I do very much. He irritates me a little.”

He was not her type at all. He was short, but not thick-set, slight rather and thin; dark and clean-shaven, with very regular, clean-cut features. His eyes were almost black, but not large, they were not very mobile and they rested on objects with a singular persistence; they were curious, but not very pleasant eyes. With his straight, delicate nose, his fine brow, and well-shaped mouth he ought to have been good-looking. But surprisingly enough he was not. When Kitty began to think of him at all she was surprised that he should have such good features when you took them one by one. His expression was slightly sarcastic and now that Kitty knew him better she realised that she was not quite at ease with him. He had no gaiety.

By the time the season drew to its end they had seen a good deal of one another, but he had remained as aloof and impenetrable as ever. He was not exactly shy with her, but embarrassed; his conversation remained strangely impersonal. Kitty came to the conclusion that he was not in the least in love with her. He liked her and found her easy to talk to, but when he returned to China in November he would not think of her again. She thought it not impossible that he was engaged all the time to some nurse at a hospital in Hong Kong, the daughter of a clergyman, dull, plain, flat-footed and strenuous; that was the wife that would exactly suit him.

Then came the announcement of Doris's engagement to Geoffrey Dennison. Doris, at eighteen, was making quite a suitable marriage, and she was twenty-five and single. Supposing she did not marry at all? That season the only person who had proposed to her was a boy of twenty who was still at Oxford: she couldn't marry a boy five years younger than herself. She had made a hash of things. Last year she had refused a widowed Knight of the Bath with three children. She almost wished she hadn't. Mother would be horrible now, and Doris, Doris who had always been sacrificed because she, Kitty, was expected to make the brilliant match, would not fail to crow over her. Kitty's heart sank.





11


But one afternoon when she was walking home from Harrod's she chanced to meet Walter Fane in the Brompton Road, He stopped and talked to her. Then, casually, he asked her if she would take a turn with him in the Park. She had no particular wish to go home; it was not just then a very agreeable place. They strolled along, talking as they always talked, of casual things, and he asked her where she was going for the summer.

“Oh, we always bury ourselves in the country. You see, father is exhausted after the term's work and we just go to the quietest place we can find.”

Kitty spoke with her tongue in her cheek, for she knew quite well that her father had not nearly enough work to tire him and even if he had his convenience would never have been consulted in the choice of a holiday. But a quiet place was a cheap place.

“Don't you think those chairs look rather inviting?” said Walter suddenly.

She followed his eyes and saw two green chairs by themselves under a tree on the grass.

“Let us sit in them,” she said.

But when they were seated he seemed to grow strangely abstracted. He was an odd creature. She chattered on, however, gaily enough and wondered why he had asked her to walk with him in the Park. Perhaps he was going to confide in her his passion for the flat-footed nurse in Hong Kong. Suddenly he turned to her, interrupting her in the middle of a sentence, so that she could not but see that he had not been listening, and his face was chalk white.

“I want to say something to you.”

She looked at him quickly and she saw that his eyes were filled with a painful anxiety. His voice was strained, low and not quite steady. But before she could ask herself what this agitation meant he spoke again.

“I want to ask if you'll marry me.”

“You could knock me down with a feather,” she answered so surprised that she looked at him blankly.

“Didn't you know I was awfully in love with you?”

“You never showed it.”

“I'm very awkward and clumsy. I always find it more difficult to say the things I mean than the things I don't.”

Her heart began to beat a little more quickly. She had been proposed to often before, but gaily or sentimentally, and she had answered in the same fashion. No one had ever asked her to marry him in a manner which was so abrupt and yet strangely tragic.

“It's very kind of you,” she said, doubtfully.

“I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I wanted to ask you before, but I could never bring myself to it.”

“I'm not sure if that's very well put,” she chuckled.

She was glad to have an opportunity to laugh a little, for on that fine, sunny day the air about them seemed on a sudden heavy with foreboding. He frowned darkly.

“Oh, you know what I mean. I didn't want to lose hope. But now you're going away and in the autumn I have to go back to China.”

“I've never thought of you in that way,” she said helplessly.

He said nothing more. He looked down on the grass sullenly. He was a very odd creature. But now that he had told her she felt in some mysterious way that his love was something she had never met before. She was a little frightened, but she was elated also. His impassivity was vaguely impressive.

“You must give me time to think.”

Still he did not say anything. He did not stir. Did he mean to keep her there till she had decided? That was absurd. She must talk it over with her mother. She ought to have got up when she spoke, she had waited, thinking he would answer, and now, she did not know why, she found it difficult to make a movement. She did not look at him, but she was conscious of his appearance; she had never seen herself marrying a man so little taller than herself. When you sat close to him you saw how good his features were, and how cold his face. It was strange when you couldn't help being conscious of the devastating passion which was in his heart.

“I don't know you, I don't know you at all,” she said tremulously.

He gave her a look and she felt her eyes drawn to his. They had a tenderness which she had never seen in them before, but there was something beseeching in them, like a dog's that has been whipped, which slightly exasperated her.

“I think I improve on acquaintance,” he said.

“Of course you're shy, aren't you?”

It was certainly the oddest proposal she had ever had. And even now it seemed to her that they were saying to one another the last things you would have expected on such an occasion. She was not in the least in love with him. She did not know why she hesitated to refuse him at once.

“I'm awfully stupid,” he said, “I want to tell you that I love you more than anything in the world, but I find it so awfully difficult to say.”

Now that was odd too, for inexplicably enough it touched her; he wasn't really cold, of course, it was his manner that was unfortunate: she liked him at that moment better than she had ever liked him before. Doris was to be married in November. He would be on his way to China then and if she married him she would be with him. It wouldn't be very nice to be a bridesmaid at Doris's wedding. She would be glad to escape that. And then Doris as a married woman and herself single! Everyone knew how young Doris was and it would make her seem older. It would put her on the shelf. It wouldn't be a very good marriage for her, but it was a marriage, and the fact that she would live in China made it easier. She was afraid of her mother's bitter tongue. Why, all the girls who had come out with her were married long ago and most of them had children; she was tired of going to see them and gushing over their babies. Walter Fane offered her a new life. She turned to him with a smile which she well knew the effect of.

“If I were so rash as to say I'd marry you, when would you want to marry me?”

He gave a sudden gasp of delight, and his white cheeks flushed.

“Now. At once. As soon as possible. We'd go to Italy for our honeymoon. August and September.”

That would save her from spending the summer in a country vicarage, hired at five guineas a week, with her father and mother. In a flash she saw in her mind's eye the announcement in the Morning Post that, the bridegroom having to return to the East, the wedding would take place at once. She knew her mother well enough, she could be counted on to make a splash; for the moment at least Doris would be in the background and when Doris's much grander wedding took place she would be far away.

She stretched out her hand.

“I think I like you very much. You must give me time to get used to you.”

“Then it's yes?” he interrupted.

“I suppose so.”





12


She knew him very little then, and now, though they had been married for nearly two years, she knew him but little more. At first she had been touched by his kindness and flattered, though surprised, by his passion. He was extremely considerate; he was very attentive to her comfort; she never expressed the slightest wish without his hastening to gratify it. He was constantly giving her little presents. When she happened to feel ill no one could have been kinder or more thoughtful. She seemed to do him a favor when she gave him the opportunity of doing something tiresome for her. And he was always exceedingly polite. He rose to his feet when she entered a room, he gave her his hand to help her out of a car, if he chanced to meet her in the street he took off his hat, he was solicitous to open the door for her when she left a room, he never came into her bedroom or her boudoir without a knock. He treated her not as Kitty had seen most men treat their wives, but as though she were a fellow-guest in a country house. It was pleasing and yet a trifle comic. She would have felt more at home with him if he had been more casual. Nor did their conjugal relations draw her closer to him. He was passionate then, fierce, oddly hysterical too, and sentimental.

It disconcerted her to realize how emotional he really was. His self-control was due to shyness or to long training, she did not know which; it seemed to her faintly contemptible that when she lay in his arms, his desire appeased, he who was so timid of saying absurd things, who so feared to be ridiculous, should use baby talk. She had offended him bitterly once by laughing and telling him that he was talking the most fearful slush. She had felt his arms grow limp about her, he remained quite silent for a little while, and then without a word released her and went into his own room. She didn't want to hurt his feelings and a day or two later she said to him:

“You silly old thing, I don't mind what nonsense you talk to me.”

He had laughed in a shamefaced way. She had discovered very soon that he had an unhappy disability to lose himself. He was self-conscious. When there was a party and everyone started singing Walter could never bring himself to join in. He sat there smiling to show that he was pleased and amused, but his smile was forced; it was more like a sarcastic smirk, and you could not help feeling that he thought all those people enjoying themselves a pack of fools. He could not bring himself to play the round games which Kitty with her high spirits found such a lark. On their journey out to China he had absolutely refused to put on fancy dress when everyone else was wearing it. It disturbed her pleasure that he should so obviously think the whole thing a bore.

Kitty was lively; she was willing to chatter all day long and she laughed easily. His silence disconcerted her. He had a way which exasperated her of returning no answer to some casual remark of hers. It was true that it needed no answer, but an answer all the same would have been pleasant. If it was raining and she said: “It's raining cats and dogs.” she would have liked him to say: “Yes, isn't it?” He remained silent. Sometimes she would have liked to shake him.

“I said it was raining cats and dogs,” she repeated.

“I heard you,” he answered, with his affectionate smile.

It showed that he had not meant to be offensive. He did not speak because he had nothing to say. But if nobody spoke unless he had something to say, Kitty reflected, with a smile, the human race would very soon lose the use of speech.





13


The fact was, of course, that he had no charm. That was why he was not popular, and she had not been long in Hong Kong before she discovered that he was not. She remained very vague about his work. It was enough for her to realize, and she did this quite distinctly, that to be the government bacteriologist was no great fry. He seemed to have no desire to discuss that part of his life with her. Because she was willing to be interested in anything at first she had asked him about it. He put her off with a jest.

“It's very dull and technical,” he said on another occasion. “And it's grossly underpaid.”

He was very reserved. All she knew about his antecedents, his birth, his education, and his life before he met her, she had elicited by direct questioning. It was odd, the only thing that seemed to annoy him was a question; and when, in her natural curiosity, she fired a string of them at him, his answers became at everyone more abrupt. She had the wit to see that he did not care to reply because he had anything to hide from her, but merely from a natural secretiveness. It bored him to talk about himself. It made him shy and uncomfortable. He did not know how to be open. He was fond of reading, but he read books which seemed to Kitty very dull. If he was not busy with some scientific treatise he would read books about China or historical works. He never relaxed. She did not think he could. He was fond of games: he played tennis and bridge.

She wondered why he had ever fallen in love with her. She could not imagine any one less suited than herself to this restrained, cold and self-possessed man. And yet it was quite certain that he loved her madly. He would do anything in the world to please her. He was like wax in her hands. When she thought of one side he showed her, a side which only she had seen, she despised him a little. She wondered whether his sarcastic manner, with its contemptuous tolerance for so many persons and things she admired, was merely a façade to conceal a profound weakness. She supposed he was clever, everyone seemed to think he was, but except very occasionally when he was with two or three people he liked and was in the mood, she had never found him entertaining. He did not precisely bore her, he left her indifferent.





14


Though Kitty had met his wife at various tea-parties she had been some weeks in Hong Kong before she saw Charles Townsend. She was introduced to him only when with her husband she went to dine at his house. Kitty was on the defensive. Charles Townsend was Assistant Colonial Secretary and she had no mind to allow him to use her with the condescension which, notwithstanding her good manners, she discerned in Mrs. Townsend. The room in which they were received was spacious. It was furnished as was every other drawing-room she had been in at Hong Kong in a comfortable and homely style. It was a large party. They were the last to come and as they entered Chinese servants in uniform were handing round cocktails and olives. Mrs. Townsend greeted them in her casual fashion and looking at a list told Walter whom he was to take in to dinner.

Kitty saw a tall and very handsome man bear down on them.

“This is my husband.”

“I am to have the privilege of sitting next to you,” he said.

She immediately felt at ease and the sense of hostility vanished from her bosom. Though his eyes were smiling she had seen in them a quick look of surprise. She understood it perfectly and it made her inclined to laugh.

“I shan't be able to eat any dinner,” he said, “and if I know Dorothy the dinner's damned good.”

“Why not?”

“I ought to have been told. Some one really ought to have warned me.”

“What about?”

“No one said a word. How was I to know that I was going to meet a raging beauty?”

“Now what am I to say to that?”

“Nothing. Leave me to do the talking. And I'll say it over and over again.”

Kitty, unmoved, wondered what exactly his wife had told him about her. He must have asked. And Townsend, looking down on her with his laughing eyes, suddenly remembered.

“What is she like?” he had inquired when his wife told him she had met Dr. Fane's bride.

“Oh, quite a nice little thing. Actressy.”

“Was she on the stage?”

“Oh, no, I don't think so. Her father's a doctor or a lawyer or something. I suppose we shall have to ask them to dinner.”

“There's no hurry, is there?”

When they were sitting side by side at table he told her that he had known Walter Fane ever since he came to the Colony.

“We play bridge together. He's far and away the best bridge player at the Club.”

She told Walter on the way home.

“That's not saying very much, you know.”

“How does he play?”

“Not badly. He plays a winning hand very well, but when he has bad cards he goes all to pieces.”

“Does he play as well as you?”

“I have no illusions about my play. I should describe myself as a very good player in the second class. Townsend thinks he's in the first. He isn't.”

“Don't you like him?”

“I neither like him nor dislike him. I believe he's not bad at his job and everyone says he's a good sportsman. He doesn't very much interest me.”

It was not the first time that Walter's moderation had exasperated her. She asked herself why it was necessary to be so prudent: you either liked people or you didn't. She had liked Charles Townsend very much. And she had not expected to. He was probably the most popular man in the Colony. It was supposed that the Colonial Secretary would retire soon and everyone hoped that Townsend would succeed him. He played tennis and polo and golf. He kept racing ponies. He was always ready to do any one a good turn. He never let red tape interfere with him. He put on no airs. Kitty did not know why she had resented hearing him so well spoken of, she could not help thinking he must be very conceited: she had been extremely silly; that was the last thing you could accuse him of.

She had enjoyed her evening. They had talked of the theatres in London, and of Ascot and Cowes, all the things she knew about, so that really she might have met him at some nice house in Lennox Gardens; and later, when the men came into the drawing-room after dinner, he had strolled over and sat beside her again. Though he had not said anything very amusing, he had made her laugh; it must have been the way he said it: there was a caressing sound in his deep, rich voice, a delightful expression in his kind, shining blue eyes, which made you feel very much at home with him. Of course he had charm. That was what made him so pleasant.

He was tall, six foot two at least, she thought, and he had a beautiful figure; he was evidently in very good condition and he had not a spare ounce of fat on him. He was well-dressed, the best-dressed man in the room, and he wore his clothes well. She liked a man to be smart. Her eyes wandered to Walter: he really should try to be a little better turned out. She noticed Townsend's cuff-links and waistcoat buttons; she had seen similar ones at Cartier's. Of course the Townsends had private means. His face was deeply sunburned, but the sun had not taken the healthy color from his cheeks. She liked the little trim curly moustache which did not conceal his full red lips. He had black hair, short and brushed very sleek. But of course his eyes, under thick, bushy eyebrows, were his best feature: they were so very blue, and they had a laughing tenderness which persuaded you of the sweetness of his disposition. No man who had those blue eyes could bear to hurt any one. She could not but know that she had made an impression on him. If he had not said charming things to her his eyes, warm with admiration, would have betrayed him. His ease was delightful. He had no self-consciousness. Kitty was at home in these circumstances and she admired the way in which amid the banter which was the staple of their conversation he insinuated every now and then a pretty, flattering speech. When she shook hands with him on leaving he gave her hand a pressure that she could not mistake.

“I hope we shall see you again soon,” he said casually, but his eyes gave his words a meaning which she could not fail to see.

“Hong Kong is very small, isn't it?” she said.

Who would have thought then that within three months they would be on such terms? He had told her since that he was crazy about her on that first evening. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He remembered the dress she wore; it was her wedding dress, and he said she looked like a lily of the valley. She knew that he was in love with her before he told her, and a little frightened she kept him at a distance. He was impetuous and it was difficult. She was afraid to let him kiss her, for the thought of his arms about her made her heart beat so fast. She had never been in love before. It was wonderful. And now that she knew what love was she felt a sudden sympathy for the love that Walter bore her. She teased him, playfully, and saw that he enjoyed it. She had been perhaps a little afraid of him, but now she had more confidence. She chaffed him and it amused her to see the slow smile with which at first he received her banter. He was surprised and pleased. One of these days, she thought, he would become quite human. Now that she had learnt something of passion it diverted her to play lightly, like a harpist running his fingers across the strings of his harp, on his affections. She laughed when she saw how she bewildered and confused him.

And when Charlie became her lover the situation between herself and Walter seemed exquisitely absurd. She could hardly look at him, so grave and self-controlled, without laughing. She was too happy to feel unkindly towards him. Except for him, after all, she would never have known Charlie. She had hesitated some time before the final step, not because she did not want to yield to Charlie's passion, her own was equal to his, but because her upbringing and all the conventions of her life intimidated her. She was amazed afterwards (and the final act was due to accident; neither of them had seen the opportunity till it was face to face with them) to discover that she felt in no way different from what she had before. She had expected that it would cause some, she hardly knew what, fantastic change in her so that she would feel like somebody else; and when she had a chance to look at herself in the glass she was bewildered to see the same woman she had seen the day before.

“Are you angry with me?” he asked her.

“I adore you,” she whispered.

“Don't you think you were very silly to waste so much time?”

“A perfect fool.”





16


Her happiness, sometimes almost more than she could bear, renewed her beauty. Just before she married, beginning to lose her first freshness, she had looked tired and drawn. The uncharitable said that she was going off. But there is all the difference between a girl of twenty-five and a married woman of that age. She was like a rosebud that is beginning to turn yellow at the edges of the petals, and then suddenly she was a rose in full bloom. Her starry eyes gained a more significant expression; her skin (that feature which had always been her greatest pride and most anxious care) was dazzling: it could not be compared to the peach or to the flower; it was they that demanded comparison with it. She looked eighteen once more. She was at the height of her glowing loveliness. It was impossible not to remark it and her women friends asked her in little friendly asides if she was going to have a baby. The indifferent who had said she was just a very pretty woman with a long nose admitted that they had misjudged her. She was what Charlie had called her the first time he saw her, a raging beauty.

They managed their intrigue with skill. He had a broad back, he told her (“I will not have you swank about your figure,” she interrupted lightly), and it did not matter about him; but for her sake they mustn't take the smallest risk. They could not meet often alone, not half often enough for him, but he had to think of her first, sometimes in the curio shop, now and then after luncheon in her house when no one was about; but she saw him a good deal here and there. It amused her then to see the formal way he spoke to her, jovial, for he was always that, with the same manner he used with every one. Who could imagine when they heard him chaff her with that charming humor of his that so lately he had held her in his passionate arms?

She worshipped him. He was splendid, in his smart top boots and his white breeches, when he played polo. In tennis clothes he looked a mere boy. Of course he was proud of his figure: it was the best figure she had ever seen. He took pains to keep it. He never ate bread or potatoes or butter. And he took a great deal of exercise. She liked the care he took of his hands; he was manicured once a week. He was a wonderful athlete and the year before he had won the local tennis championship. Certainly he was the best dancer she had ever danced with; it was a dream to dance with him. No one would think he was forty. She told him she did not believe it.

“I believe it's all bluff and you're really twenty-five.”

He laughed. He was well pleased.

“Oh, my dear, I have a boy of fifteen. I'm a middle-aged gent. In another two or three years I shall just be a fat old party.”

“You'll be adorable when you're a hundred.”

She liked his black, bushy eyebrows. She wondered whether it was they that gave his blue eyes their disturbing expression.

He was full of accomplishments. He could play the piano quite well, rag-time, of course, and he could sing a comic song with a rich voice and good humor. She did not believe there was anything he could not do: He was very clever at his work too and she shared his pleasure when he told her that the Governor had particularly congratulated him on the way he had done some difficult job.

“Although it's I as says it,” he laughed, his eyes charming with the love he bore her, “there's not a fellow in the Service who could have done it better.”

Oh, how she wished that she were his wife rather than Walter's!





17


Of course it was not certain yet that Walter knew the truth, and if he didn't it was better perhaps to leave well alone; but if he did, well, in the end it would be the best thing for all of them. At first she had been, if not satisfied, at least resigned to seeing Charlie only by stealth; but time had increased her passion and for some while now she had been increasingly impatient of the obstacles which prevented them from being always together. He had told her so often that he cursed his position which forced him to be so discreet, the ties which bound him, and the ties which bound her: how marvellous it would have been, he said, if they were both free! She saw his point of view; no one wanted a scandal, and of course it required a good deal of thinking over before you changed the course of your life; but if freedom were thrust upon them, ah, then, how simple everything would be!

It was not as though any one would suffer very much. She knew exactly what his relations were with his wife. She was a cold woman and there had been no love between them for years. It was habit that held them together, convenience, and of course the children. It was easier for Charlie than for her: Walter loved her; but after all, he was absorbed in his work; and a man always had his club; he might be upset at first, but he would get over it; there was no reason why he should not marry somebody else. Charlie had told her that he could not make out how she came to throw herself away on Walter Fane.

She wondered, half smiling, why a little while before she had been terrified at the thought that Walter had caught them. Of course it was startling to see the handle of the door slowly turn. But after all they knew the worst that Walter could do, and they were ready for it. Charlie would feel as great a relief as she that what they both desired more than anything in the world should be thus forced upon them.

Walter was a gentleman, she would do him the justice to acknowledge that, and he loved her; he would do the right thing and allow her to divorce him. They had made a mistake and the lucky thing was that they had found it out before it was too late. She made up her mind exactly what she was going to say to him and how she would treat him. She would be kind, smiling, and firm. There was no need for them to quarrel. Later on she would always be glad to see him. She hoped honestly that the two years they had spent together would remain with him as a priceless memory.

“I don't suppose Dorothy Townsend will mind divorcing Charlie a bit,” she thought. “Now the youngest boy is going back to England it will be much nicer for her to be in England too. There's absolutely nothing for her to do in Hong Kong. She'll be able to spend all the holidays with her boys. And then she's got her father and mother in England.”

It was all very simple and everything could be managed without scandal or ill-feeling. And then she and Charlie could marry. Kitty drew a long sigh. They would be very happy. It was worth going through a certain amount of bother to achieve that. Confusedly, one picture jostling another, she thought of the life they would lead together, of the fun they would have and the little journeys they would take together, the house they would live in, the positions he would rise to, and the help she would be to him. He would be very proud of her and she, she adored him.

But through all these day-dreams ran a current of apprehension. It was funny: it was as though the wood and the strings of the orchestra played Arcadian melodies and in the bass the drums, softly but with foreboding, beat a grim tattoo. Sooner or later Walter must come home and her heart beat fast at the thought of meeting him: it was strange that he had gone away that afternoon without saying a word to her. Of course she was not frightened of him; after all what could he do, she repeated to herself; but she could not quite allay her uneasiness. Once more she repeated what she would say to him. What was the good of making a scene? She was very sorry, Heaven knew she didn't want to cause him pain, but she couldn't help it if she didn't love him. It was no good pretending and it was always better to tell the truth. She hoped he wouldn't be unhappy, but they had made a mistake and the only sensible thing was to acknowledge it. She would always think kindly of him.

But even as she said this to herself a sudden gust of fear made the sweat start out in the palms of her hands. And because she was frightened she grew angry with him. If he wanted to make a scene, that was his lookout; he must not be surprised if he got more than he bargained for. She would tell him that she had never cared two pins for him and that not a day had passed since their marriage without her regretting it. He was dull. Oh, how he'd bored her, bored her, bored her! He thought himself so much better than any one else, it was laughable; he had no sense of humour; she hated his supercilious air, his coldness, and his self-control. It was easy to be self-controlled when you were interested in nothing and nobody but yourself. He was repulsive to her. She hated to let him kiss her. What had he to be so conceited about? He danced rottenly, he was a wet blanket at a party, he couldn't play or sing, he couldn't play polo and his tennis was no better than anybody else's. Bridge? Who cared about bridge?

Kitty worked herself up into a towering passion. Let him dare to reproach her. All that had happened was his own fault. She was thankful that he knew the truth at last. She hated him and wished never to see him again. Yes, she was thankful that it was all over. Why couldn't he leave her alone? He had pestered her into marrying him and now she was fed up.

“Fed up,” she repeated aloud, trembling with anger. “Fed up! Fed up!”

She heard the car draw up to the gate of their garden. He was coming up the stairs.





18


He came into the room. Her heart was beating wildly and her hands were shaking; it was lucky that she lay on the sofa. She was holding an open book as though she had been reading. He stood for an instant on the threshold and their eyes met. Her heart sank; she felt on a sudden a cold chill pass through her limbs and she shivered. She had that feeling which you describe by saying that some one was walking over your grave. His face was deathly pale; she had seen it like that once before, when they sat together in the Park and he asked her to marry him. His dark eyes, immobile and inscrutable, seemed pretematurally large. He knew everything.

“You're back early,” she remarked.

Her lips trembled so that she could hardly frame the words. She was terrified. She was afraid she would faint.

“I think it's about the usual time.”

His voice sounded strange to her. It was raised on the last word in order to give his remark a casual air, but it was forced. She wondered if he saw that she was shaking in every limb. It was only by an effort that she did not scream. He dropped his eyes.

“I'm just going to dress.”

He left the room. She was shattered. For two or three minutes she could not stir, but at last, raising herself from the sofa, with difficulty, as though she had had an illness and were still weak, she found her feet. She did not know if her legs would support her. She felt her way by means of chairs and tables to the verandah and then with one hand on the wall went to her room. She put on a tea-gown and when she went back into her boudoir (they only used the drawing-room when there was a party) he was standing at a table looking at the pictures of the Sketch. She had to force herself to enter.

“Shall we go down? Dinner is ready.”

“Have I kept you waiting?”

It was dreadful that she could not control the trembling of her lips.

When was he going to speak?

They sat down and for a moment there was silence between them. Then he made a remark and because it was so commonplace it had a sinister air.

“The Empress didn't come in to-day,” he said.“I wonder if she's been delayed by a storm.”

“Was she due to-day?”

“Yes.”

She looked at him now and saw that his eyes were fixed on his plate. He made another observation, equally trivial, about a tennis tournament that was about to be played, and he spoke at length. His voice as a rule was agreeable, with a variety of tone, but now he spoke on one note. It was strangely unnatural. It gave Kitty the impression that he was speaking from a long way off. And all the time his eyes were directed to his plate, or the table, or to a picture on the wall. He would not meet hers. She realised that he could not bear to look at her.

“Shall we go upstairs?” he said when dinner was finished.

“If you like.”

She rose and he held open the door for her. His eyes were cast down as she passed him. When they reached the sittingroom he took up the illustrated paper once more.

“Is this a new Sketch? I don't think I've seen it.”

“I don't know. I haven't noticed.”

It had been lying about for a fortnight and she knew that he had looked it through and through. He took it and sat down. She lay again on the sofa and took her book. As a rule in the evening, when they were alone, they played coon-can or patience. He was leaning back in an arm-chair, in a comfortable attitude, and his attention seemed absorbed by the illustration he was looking at. He did not turn the page. She tried to read, but she could not see the print before her eyes. The words were blurred. Her head began to ache violently.

When would he speak?

They sat in silence for an hour. She gave up the pretence of reading, and letting her novel fall on her lap, gazed into space. She was afraid to make the smallest gesture or the smallest sound. He sat quite still, in that same easy attitude, and stared with those wide, immobile eyes of his at the picture. His stillness was strangely menacing. It gave Kitty the feeling of a wild beast prepared to spring.

When suddenly he stood up she started. She clenched her hands and she felt herself grow pale. Now!

“I have some work to do,” he said in that quiet, toneless voice, his eyes averted. “If you don't mind I'll go into my study. I daresay you'll have gone to bed by the time I've finished.”

“I am rather tired to-night.”

“Well, good-night.”

“Good-night.”

He left the room.





19


As soon as she could next morning she rang Townsend up at his office:

“Yes, what is it?”

“I want to see you.”

“My dear, I'm awfully busy. I'm a working man.”

“It's very important. Can I come down to the office?”

“Oh, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you.”

“Well, come here then.”

“I can't possibly get away. What about this afternoon? And don't you think it would be better if I didn't come to your house?”

“I must see you at once.”

There was a pause and she was afraid that she had been cut off.

“Are you there?” she asked anxiously.

“Yes, I was thinking. Has anything happened?”

“I can't tell you over the telephone.”

There was another silence before he spoke again.

“Well, look here, I can manager to see you for ten minutes at one if that'll do. You'd better go to Ku-Chou's and I'll come along as soon as I can.”

“The curio shop?” she asked in dismay.

“Well, we can't meet in the lounge at the Hong Kong Hotel very well,” he answered.

She noticed a trace of irritation in his voice.

“Very well. I'll go to Ku-Chou's.”





20


She got out of her rickshaw in the Victoria Road and walked up the steep, narrow lane till she came to the shop. She lingered outside a moment as though her attention were attracted by the bric-à-brac which was displayed. But a boy who was standing there on the watch for customers, recognising her at once, gave her a broad smile of connivance. He said something in Chinese to some one within and the master, a little, fat-faced man in a black gown, came out and greeted her. She walked in quickly.

“Mr. Townsend no come yet. You go top-side, yes?”

She went to the back of the shop and walked up the rickety, dark stairs. The Chinese followed her and unlocked the door that led into the bedroom. It was stuffy and there was an acrid smell of opium. She sat down on a sandalwood chest.

In a moment she heard a heavy step on the creaking stairs. Townsend came in and shut the door behind him. His face bore a sullen look, as he saw her it vanished, and he smiled in that charming way of his. He took her quickly in his arms and kissed her lips.

“Now what's the trouble?”

“It makes me feel better just to see you,” she smiled.

He sat down on the bed and lit a cigarette.

“You look rather washed out this morning.”

“I don't wonder,” she answered. “I don't think I closed my eyes all night.”

He gave her a look. He was smiling still, but his smile was a little set and unnatural. She thought there was a shade of anxiety in his eyes.

“He knows,” she said.

There was an instant's pause before he answered.

“What did he say?”

“He hasn't said anything.”

“What!” He looked at her sharply. “What makes you think he knows?”

“Everything. His look. The way he talked at dinner.”

“Was he disagreeable?”

“No, on the contrary, he was scrupulously polite. For the first time since we married he didn't kiss me goodnight.”

She dropped her eyes. She was not sure if Charlie understood. As a rule Walter took her in his arms and pressed his lips to hers and would not let them go. His whole body grew tender and passionate with his kiss.

“Why do you imagine he didn't say anything?”

“I don't know.”

There was a pause. Kitty sat very still on the sandal wood box and looked with anxious attention at Townsend. His face once more was sullen and there was a frown between his brows. His mouth dropped a little at the corners. But all at once he looked up and a gleam of malicious amusement came into his eyes.

“I wonder if he is going to say anything.”

She did not answer. She did not know what he meant.

“After all, he wouldn't be the first man who's shut his eyes in a case of this sort. What has he to gain by making a row? If he'd wanted to make a row he would have insisted on coming into your room.” His eyes twinkled and his lips broke into a broad smile. “We should have looked a pair of damned fools.”

“I wish you could have seen his face last night.”

“I expect he was upset. It was naturally a shock. It's a damned humiliating position for any man. He always looks a fool. Walter doesn't give me the impression of a fellow who'd care to wash a lot of dirty linen in public.”

“I don't think he would,” she answered reflectively. “He's very sensitive, I've discovered that.”

“That's all to the good as far as we're concerned. You know, it's a very good plan to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and ask yourself how you would act in his place. There's only one way in which a man can save his face when he's in that sort of position and that is to pretend he knows nothing. I bet you anything you like that that is exactly what he's going to do.”

The more Townsend talked the more buoyant he became. His blue eyes sparkled and he was once more his gay and jovial self. He irradiated an encouraging confidence.

“Heavens knows, I don't want to say anything disagreeable about him, but when you come down to brass tacks a bacteriologist is no great shakes. The chances are that I shall be Colonial Secretary when Simmons goes home, and it's to Walter's interest to keep on the right side of me. He's got his bread and butter to think of, like the rest of us: do you think the Colonial Office are going to do much for a fellow who makes a scandal? Believe me, he's got everything to gain by holding his tongue and everything to lose by kicking up a row.”

Kitty moved uneasily. She knew how shy Walter was and she could believe that the fear of a scene, and the dread of public attention, might have influence upon him; but she could not believe that he would be affected by the thought of a material advantage. Perhaps she didn't know him very well, but Charlie didn't know him at all.

“Has it occurred to you that he's madly in love with me?”

He did not answer, but he smiled at her with roguish eyes. She knew and loved that charming look of his.

“Well, what is it? I know you're going to say something awful.”

“Well, you know, women are often under the impression that men are much more madly in love with them than they really are.”

For the first time she laughed. His confidence was catching.

“What a monstrous thing to say.”

“I put it to you that you haven't been bothering much about your husband lately. Perhaps he isn't quite so much in love with you as he was.”

“At all events I shall never delude myself that you are madly in love with me,” she retorted.

“That's where you're wong.”

Ah, how good it was to hear him say that! She knew it and her belief in his passion warmed her heart. As he spoke he rose from the bed and came and sat down beside her on the sandalwood box. He put his arm round her waist.

“Don't worry your silly little head a moment longer,” he said.“I promise you there's nothing to fear. I'm as certain as I am of anything that he's going to pretend he knows nothing. You know, this sort of thing is awfully difficult to prove. You say he's in love with you; perhaps he doesn't want to lose you altogether. I swear I'd accept anything rather than that if you were my wife.”

She leaned towards him. Her body became limp and yielding against his arm. The love she felt for him was almost torture. His last words had struck her: perhaps Walter loved her so passionately that he was prepared to accept any humiliation if sometimes she would let him love her. She could understand that; for that was how she felt towards Charlie. A thrill of pride passed through her, and at the same time a faint sensation of contempt for a man who could love so slavishly.

She put her arm lovingly round Charlie's neck.

“You're simply wonderful. I was shaking like a leaf when I came here and you've made everything all right.”

He took her face in his hand and kissed her lips.

“Darling.”

“You're such a comfort to me,” she sighed.

“I'm sure you need not be nervous. And you know I'll stand by you. I won't let you down.”

She put away her fears, but for an instant unreasonably she regretted that her plans for the future were shattered. Now that all danger was past she almost wished that Walter were going to insist on a divorce.

“I knew I could count on you,” she said.

“So I should hope.”

“Oughtn't you to go and have your tiffin?”

“Oh, damn my tiffin.”

He drew her more closely to him and now she was held tight in his arms. His mouth sought hers.

“Oh, Charlie, you must let me go.”

“Never.”

She gave a little laugh, a laugh of happy love and of triumph; his eyes were heavy with desire. He lifted her to her feet and not letting her go but holding her close to his breast he locked the door.





21


All through the afternoon she thought of what Charlie had said about Walter. They were dining out that evening and when he came back from the Club she was dressing. He knocked at her door.

“Come in.”

He did not open.

“I'm going straight along to dress. How long will you be?”

“Ten minutes.”

He said nothing more, but went to his own room. His voice had that constrained note which she had heard in it the night before. She felt fairly sure of herself now. She was ready before he was and when he came downstairs she was already seated in the car.

“I'm afraid I've kept you waiting,” he said.

“I shall survive it,” she replied, and she was able to smile as she spoke.

She made an observation or two as they drove down the hill, but he answered curtly. She shrugged her shoulders; she was growing a trifle impatient: if he wanted to sulk, let him, she didn't care. They drove in silence till they reached their destination. It was a large dinner party. There were too many people and too many courses. While Kitty chatted gaily with her neighbours she watched Walter. He was deathly pale and his face was pinched.

“Your husband is looking rather washed out. I thought he didn't mind the heat. Has he been working very hard?”

“He always works hard.”

“I suppose you're going away soon?”

“Oh, yes, I think I shall go to Japan as I did last year,” she said.“The doctor says I must get out of the heat if I don't want to go all to pieces.”

Walter did not as usual when they were dining out give her a smiling glance now and then. He never looked at her. She had noticed that when he came down to the car he kept his eyes averted, and he did the same when, with his usual politeness, he gave her his hand to alight. Now, talking with the women on either side of him, he did not smile, but looked at them with steady and unblinking eyes; and really his eyes looked enormous and in that pale face coal black. His face was set and stern.

“He must be an agreeable companion,” thought Kitty ironically.

The idea of those unfortunate ladies trying to indulge in small talk with that grim mask not a little diverted her.

Of course he knew; there was no doubt about that, and he was furious with her. Why hadn't he said anything? Was it really because, though angry and hurt, he loved her so much that he was afraid she would leave him? The thought made her ever so slightly despise him, but good-naturedly: after all, he was her husband and he provided her with board and lodging; so long as he didn't interfere with her and let her do as she liked she would be quite nice to him. On the other hand perhaps his silence was due merely to a morbid timidity. Charlie was right when he said that no one would hate a scandal more than Walter. He never made a speech if he could help it. He had told her once that when he was subpoenaed as a witness on a case where he was to give expert evidence he had hardly slept for a week before. His shyness was a disease.

And there was another thing: men were very vain, and so long as no one knew what had happened it might be that Walter would be content to ignore it. Then she wondered whether by any possibility Charlie was right when he suggested that Walter knew which side his bread was buttered. Charlie was the most popular man in the Colony and soon would be the Colonial Secretary. He could be very useful to Walter: on the other hand he could make himself very unpleasant if Walter put his back up. Her heart exulted as she thought of her lover's strength and determination; she felt so defenceless in his virile arms. Men were strange: it would never have occurred to her that Walter was capable of such baseness, and yet you never knew; perhaps his seriousness was merely a mask for a mean and pettifogging nature. The more she considered it the more likely it seemed that Charlie was right; and she turned her glance once more on her husband. There was no indulgence in it.

It happened that just then the women on either side of him were talking with their neighbours and he was left alone. He was staring straight in front of him, forgetful of the party, and his eyes were filled with a mortal sadness. It gave Kitty a shock.

Next day when she was lying down after luncheon, dozing, she was aroused by a knock at her door.

“Who is it?” she cried irritably.

At that hour she was unaccustomed to be disturbed.

“I.”

She recognized her husband's voice and she sat up quickly.

“Come in.”

“Did I wake you?” he asked as he entered.

“In point of fact you did,” she answered in the natural tone she had adopted with him for the last two days.

“Will you come into the next room. I want to have a little talk with you.”

Her heart gave a sudden beat against her ribs.

“I'll put on a dressing-gown.”

He left her. She slipped her bare feet into mules and wrapped herself in a kimono. She looked in the glass; she was very pale and she put on some rouge. She stood at the door for a moment, nerving herself for the interview, and then with a bold face joined him.

“How did you manage to get away from the Laboratory at this hour?” she said. “I don't often see you at this sort of time.”

“Won't you sit down?”

He did not look at her. He spoke gravely. She was glad to do as he asked: her knees were a little shaky, and unable to continue in that jocular tone she kept silent. He sat also and lit a cigarette. His eyes wandered restlessly about the room. He seemed to have some difficulty in starting.

Suddenly he looked full at her; and because he had held his eyes so long averted, his direct gaze gave her such a fright that she smothered a cry.

“Have you ever heard of Mei-tan-fu?” he asked. “There's been a good deal about it in the papers lately.”

She stared at him in astonishment. She hesitated.

“Is that the place where there's cholera? Mr. Arbuthnot was talking about it last night.”

“There's an epidemic. I believe it's the worst they've had for years. There was a medical missionary there. He died of cholera three days ago. There's a French convent there and of course there's the Customs man. everyone else has got out.”

His eyes were still fixed on her and she could not lower hers. She tried to read his expression, but she was nervous, and she could only discern a strange watchfulness. How could he look so steadily? He did not even blink.

“The French nuns are doing what they can. They've turned the orphanage into a hospital. But the people are dying like flies. I've offered to go and take charge.”

“You?”

She started violently. Her first thought was that if he went she would be free and without let or hindrance could see Charlie. But the thought shocked her. She felt herself go scarlet. Why did he watch her like that? She looked away in embarrassment.

“Is that necessary?” she faltered.

“There's not a foreign doctor in the place.”

“But you're not a doctor, you're a bacteriologist.”

“I am an M.D., you know, and before I specialised I did a good deal of general work in a hospital. The fact that I'm first and foremost a bacteriologist is all to the good. It will be an admirable chance for research work.”

He spoke almost flippantly and when she glanced at him she was surprised to see in his eyes a gleam of mockery. She could not understand.

“But won't it be awfully dangerous?”

“Awfully.”

He smiled. It was a derisive grimace. She leaned her forehead on her hand. Suicide. It was nothing short of that. Dreadful! She had not thought he would take it like that. She couldn't let him do that. It was cruel. It was not her fault if she did not love him. She couldn't bear the thought that he should kill himself for her sake. Tears flowed softly down her cheeks.

“What are you crying for?”

His voice was cold.

“You're not obliged to go, are you?”

“No, I go of my own free will.”

“Please don't, Walter. It would be too awful if something happened. Supposing you died?”

Though his face remained impassive the shadow of a smile once more crossed his eyes. He did not answer.

“Where is this place?” she asked after a pause.

“Mei-tan-fu? It's on a tributary of the Western River. We should go up the Western River and then by chair.”

“Who is we?”

“You and I.”

She looked at him quickly. She thought she had heard amiss. But now the smile in his eyes had travelled to his lips. His dark eyes were fixed on her.

“Are you expecting me to come too?”

“I thought you'd like to.”

Her breath began to come very fast. A shudder passed through her.

“But surely it's no place for a woman. The missionary sent his wife and children down weeks ago and the A.P.C. man and his wife came down. I met her at a tea-party. I've just remembered that she said they left some place on account of cholera.”

“There are five French nuns there.”

Panic seized her.

“I don't know what you mean. It would be madness for me to go. You know how delicate I am. Dr. Hayward said I must get out of Hong Kong on account of the heat. I could never stand the heat up there. And cholera: I should be frightened out of my wits. It's just asking for trouble. There's no reason for me to go. I should die.”

He did not answer. She looked at him in her desperation and she could hardly restrain a cry. His face had a sort of black pallor which suddenly terrified her. She saw in it a look of hatred. Was it possible that he wanted her to die? She answered her own outrageous thought.

“It's absurd. If you think you ought to go it's your own lookout. But really you can't expect me to. I hate illness. A cholera epidemic. I don't pretend to be very brave and I don't mind telling you that I haven't pluck for that. I shall stay here until it's time for me to go to Japan.”

“I should have thought that you would want to accompany me when I am about to set out on a dangerous expedition.”

He was openly mocking her now. She was confused. She did not quite know whether he meant what he said or was merely trying to frighten her.

“I don't think any one could reasonably blame me for refusing to go to a dangerous place where I had no business or where I could be of no use.”

“You could be of the greatest use; you could cheer and comfort me.”

She grew even a little paler.

“I don't understand what you're talking about.”

“I shouldn't have thought it needed more than average intelligence.”

“I'm not going, Walter. It's monstrous to ask me.”

“Then I shall not go either. I shall immediately file my petition.”





23


She looked at him blankly. What he said was so unexpected that at the first moment she could hardly gather its sense.

“What on earth are you talking about?” she faltered.

Even to herself her reply rang false, and she saw the look of disdain which it called forth on Walter's stern face.

“I'm afraid you've thought me a bigger fool than I am.”

She did not quite know what to say. She was undecided whether indignantly to assert her innocence or to break out into angry reproaches. He seemed to read her thoughts.

“I've got all the proof necessary.”

She began to cry. The tears flowed from her eyes without any particular anguish and she did not dry them: to weep gave her a little time to collect herself. But her mind was blank. He watched her without concern, and his calmness frightened her. He grew impatient.

“You're not going to do much by crying, you know.”

His voice, so cold and hard, had the effect of exciting in her a certain indignation. She was recovering her nerve.

“I don't care. I suppose you have no objection to my divorcing you. It means nothing to a man.”

“Will you allow me to ask why I should put myself to the smallest inconvenience on your account?”

“It can't make any difference to you. It's not much to ask you to behave like a gentleman.”

“I have much too great a regard for your welfare.”

She sat up now and dried her eyes.

“What do you mean?” she asked him.

“Townsend will marry you only if he is co-respondent and the case is so shameless that his wife is forced to divorce him.”

“You don't know what you're talking about,” she cried.

“You stupid fool.”

His tone was so contemptuous that she flushed with anger. And perhaps her anger was greater because she had never before heard him say to her any but sweet, flattering, and delightful things. She had been accustomed to find him subservient to all her whims.

“If you want the truth you can have it. He's only too anxious to marry me. Dorothy Townsend is perfectly willing to divorce him and we shall be married the moment we're free.”

“Did he tell you that in so many words or is that the impression you have gained from his manner?”

Walter's eyes shone with bitter mockery. They made Kitty a trifle uneasy. She was not quite sure that Charlie had ever said exactly that in so many words.

“He's said it over and over again.”

“That's a lie and you know it's a lie.”

“He loves me with all his heart and soul. He loves me as passionately as I love him. You've found out. I'm not going to deny anything. Why should I? We've been lovers for a year and I'm proud of it. He means everything in the world to me and I'm glad that you know at last. We're sick to death of secrecy and compromise and all the rest of it. It was a mistake that I ever married you, I never should have done it, I was a fool. I never cared for you. We never had anything in common. I don't like the people you like and I'm bored by the things that interest you. I'm thankful it's finished.”

He watched her without a gesture and without a movement of his face. He listened attentively and no change in his expression showed that what she said affected him.

“Do you know why I married you?”

“Because you wanted to be married before your sister Doris.”

It was true, but it gave her a funny little turn to realise that he knew it. Oddly enough, even in that moment of fear and anger, it excited her compassion. He faintly smiled.

“I had no illusions about you,” he said. “I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It's comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew. I knew that you'd only married me for convenience. I loved you so much, I didn't care. Most people, as far as I can see, when they're in love with someone and the love isn't returned feel that they have a grievance. They grow angry and bitter. I wasn't like that. I never expected you to love me, I didn't see any reason that you should, I never thought myself very lovable. I was thankful to be allowed to love you and I was enraptured when now and then I thought you were pleased with me or when I noticed in your eyes a gleam of good-humoured affection. I tried not to bore you with my love; I knew I couldn't afford to do that and I was always on the lookout for the first sign that you were impatient with my affection. What most husbands expect as a right I was prepared to receive as a favor.”

Kitty, accustomed to flattery all her life, had never heard such things said to her before. Blind wrath, driving out fear, arose in her heart: it seemed to choke her, and she felt the blood-vessels in her temples swell and throb. Wounded vanity can make a woman more vindictive than a lioness robbed of her cubs. Kitty's jaw, always a little too square, protruded with an apish hideousness and her beautiful eyes were black with malice. But she kept her temper in check.

“If a man hasn't what's necessary to make a woman love him, it's his fault, not hers.”

“Evidently.”

His derisive tone increased her irritation. She felt that she could wound him more by maintaining her calm.

“I'm not very welleducated and I'm not very clever. I'm just a perfectly ordinary young woman. I like the things that the people like among whom I've lived all my life. I like dancing and tennis and theatres and I like the men who play games. It's quite true that I've always been bored by you and by the things you like. They mean nothing to me and I don't want them to. You dragged me round those interminable galleries in Venice: I should have enjoyed myself much more playing golf at Sandwich.”

“I know.”

“I'm sorry if I haven't been all that you expected me to be. Unfortunately I always found you physically repulsive. You can hardly blame me for that.”

“I don't.”

Kitty could more easily have coped with the situation if he had raved and stormed. She could have met violence with violence. His self-control was inhuman and she hated him now as she had never hated him before.

“I don't think you're a man at all. Why didn't you break into the room when you knew I was there with Charlie? You might at least have tried to thrash him. Were you afraid?”

But the moment she had said this she flushed, for she was ashamed. He did not answer, but in his eyes she read an icy disdain. The shadow of a smile flickered on his lips.

“It may be that, like an historical character, I am too proud to fight.”

Kitty, unable to think of anything to answer, shrugged her shoulders. For a moment longer he held her in his immobile gaze.

“I think I've said all I had to say: if you refuse to come to Mei-tan-fu I shall file my petition.”

“Why won't you consent to let me divorce you?”

He took his eyes off her at last. He leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette. He smoked it to the end without saying a word. Then, throwing away the butt, he gave a little smile. He looked at her once more.

“If Mrs. Townsend will give me her assurance that she will divorce her husband and if he will give me his written promise to marry you within a week of the two decrees being made absolute, I will do that.”

There was something in the way he spoke which disconcerted her. But her self-respect obliged her to accept his offer in the grand manner.

“That is very generous of you, Walter.”

To her astonishment he burst suddenly into a shout of laughter. She flushed angrily.

“What are you laughing at? I see nothing to laugh at.”

“I beg your pardon. I daresay my sense of humour is peculiar.”

She looked at him frowning. She would have liked to say something bitter and wounding, but no rejoinder occurred to her. He looked at his watch.

“You had better look sharp if you want to catch Townsend at his office. If you decide to come with me to Mei-tan-fu it would be necessary to start the day after to-morrow.”

“Do you want me to tell him to-day?”

“They say there is no time like the present.”

Her heart began to beat a little faster. It was not uneasiness that she felt, it was, she didn't quite know what it was. She wished she could have had a little longer; she would have liked to prepare Charlie. But she had the fullest confidence in him, he loved her as much as she loved him, and it was treacherous even to let the thought cross her mind that he would not welcome the necessity that was forced upon them. She turned to Walter gravely.

“I don't think you know what love is. You have no conception how desperately in love Charlie and I are with one another. It really is the only thing that matters and every sacrifice that our love calls for will be as easy as falling off a log.”

He gave a little bow, but said nothing, and his eyes followed her as she walked with measured step from the room.





24


She sent in a little note to Charlie on which she had written: “Please see me. It is urgent.” A Chinese boy asked her to wait and brought the answer that Mr. Townsend would see her in five minutes. She was unaccountably nervous. When at last she was ushered into his room Charlie came forward to shake hands with her, but the moment the boy, having closed the door, left them alone he dropped the affable formality of his manner.

“I say, my dear, you really mustn't come here in working hours. I've got an awful lot to do and we don't want to give people a chance to gossip.”

She gave him a long look with those beautiful eyes of her and tried to smile, but her lips were stiff and she could not.

“I wouldn't have come unless it was necessary.”

He smiled and took her arm.

“Well, since you're here come and sit down.”

It was a bare room, narrow, with a high ceiling; its walls were painted in two shades of terra cotta. The only furniture consisted of a large desk, a revolving chair for Townsend to sit in and a leather arm-chair for visitors. It intimidated Kitty to sit in this. He sat at the desk. She had never seen him in spectacles before; she did not know that he used them. When he noticed that her eyes were on them he took them off.

“I only use them for reading,” he said.

Her tears came easily and now, she hardly knew why, she began to cry. She had no deliberate intention of deceiving, but rather an instinctive desire to excite his sympathy. He looked at her blankly.

“Is anything the matter? Oh, my dear, don't cry.”

She took out her handkerchief and tried to check her sobs. He rang the bell and when the boy came to the door went to it.

“If any one asks for me say I'm out.”

“Very good, sir.”

The boy closed the door. Charlie sat on the arm of the chair and put his arm round Kitty's shoulders.

“Now, Kitty dear, tell me all about it.”

“Walter wants a divorce,” she said.

She felt the pressure of his arm on her shoulder cease. His body stiffened. There was a moment's silence, then Townsend rose from her chair and sat down once more in his.

“What exactly do you mean?” he said.

She looked at him quickly, for his voice was hoarse, and she saw that his face was dully red.

“I've had a talk with him. I've come straight from the house now. He says he has all the proof he wants.”

“You didn't commit yourself, did you? You didn't acknowledge anything?”

Her heart sank.

“No,” she answered.

“Are you quite sure?” he asked, looking at her sharply.

“Quite sure,” she lied again.

He leaned back in his chair and stared vacantly at the map of China which was hanging on the wall in front of him. She watched him anxiously. She was somewhat disconcerted at the manner in which he had received the news. She had expected him to take her in his arms and tell her he was thankful, for now they could be together always; but of course men were funny. She was crying softly, not now to arouse sympathy, but because it seemed the natural thing to do.

“This is a bloody mess we've got into,” he said at length. “But it's no good losing our heads. Crying isn't going to do us any good, you know.”

She noticed the irritation in his voice and dried her eyes.

“It's not my fault, Charlie. I couldn't help it.”

“Of course you couldn't. It was just damned bad luck. I was just as much to blame as you were. The thing to do now is to see how we're going to get out of it. I don't suppose you want to be divorced any more than I do.”

She smothered a gasp. She gave him a searching look. He was not thinking of her at all.

“I wonder what his proofs really are. I don't know how he can actually prove that we were together in that room. On the whole we've been about as careful as any one could be. I'm sure that old fellow at the curio shop wouldn't have given us away. Even if he'd seen us go in there's not reason why we shouldn't hunt curios together.”

He was talking to himself rather than to her.

“It's easy enough to bring charges, but it's damned difficult to prove them; any lawyer will tell you that. Our line is to deny everything, and if he threatens to bring an action we'll tell him to go to hell and we'll fight it.”

“I couldn't go into court, Charlie.”

“Why on earth not? I'm afraid you'll have to. God knows, I don't want a row, but we can't take it lying down.”

“Why need we defend it?”

“What a question to ask. After all, it's not only you that are concerned, I'm concerned too. But as a matter of fact I don't think you need be afraid of that. We shall be able to square your husband somehow. The only thing that worries me is the best way to set about it.”

It looked as though an idea occurred to him, for he turned towards her with his charming smile and his tone, a moment before abrupt and business-like, became ingratiating.

“I'm afraid you've been awfully upset, poor little woman. It's too bad.” He stretched out his hand and took hers. “It's a scrape we've got into, but we shall get out of it. It's not...” He stopped and Kitty had a suspicion that he had been about to say that it was not the first he had got out of. “The greatest thing is to keep our heads. You know I shall never let you down.”

“I'm not frightened. I don't care what he does.”

He smiled still, but perhaps his smile was a trifle forced.

“If the worst comes to the worst I shall have to tell the Governor. He'll curse me like hell, but he's a good fellow and a man of the world. He'll fix it up somehow. It wouldn't do him any good if there was a scandal.”

“What can he do?” asked Kitty.

“He can bring pressure to bear on Walter. If he can't get at him through his ambition he'll get at him through his sense of duty.”

Kitty was a little chilled. She did not seem able to make Charlie see how desperately grave the situation was. His airiness made her impatient. She was sorry that she had come to see him in his office. The surroundings intimidated her. It would have been much easier to say what she wanted if she could have been in his arms with hers round his neck.

“You don't know Walter,” she said.

“I know that every man has his price.”

She loved Charlie with all her heart, but his reply disconcerted her; for such a clever man it was a stupid thing to say.

“I don't think you realise how angry Walter is. You haven't seen his face and the look of his eyes.”

He did not reply for a moment, but looked at her with a slight smile. She knew what he was thinking. Walter was the bacteriologist and occupied a subordinate position; he would hardly have the impudence to make himself a nuisance to the upper officials of the Colony.

“It's no good deceiving yourself, Charlie,” she said earnestly. “If Walter has made up his mind to bring an action nothing that you or anybody else can say will have the slightest influence.”

His face once more grew heavy and sulky.

“Is it his idea to make me co-rrespondent?”

“At first it was. At last I managed to get him to consent to let me divorce him.”

“Oh, well, that's not so terrible.” His manner relaxed again and she saw the relief in his eyes. “That seems to me a very good way out. After all, it's the least a man can do, it's the only decent thing.”

“But he makes a condition.”

He gave her an inquiring glance and he seemed to reflect.

“Of course I'm not a very rich man, but I'll do anything in my power.”

Kitty was silent. Charlie was saying things which she would never have expected him to say. And they made it difficult for her to speak. She had expected to blurt it out in one breath, held in his loving arms, with her burning face hid on his breast.

“He agrees to my divorcing him if your wife will give him the assurance that she will divorce you.”

“Anything else?”

Kitty could hardly find her voice.

“And--it's awfully hard to say, Charlie, it sounds dreadful--if you'll promise to marry me within a week of the decrees being made absolute.”





25


For a moment he was silent. Then he took her hand again and pressed it gently.

“You know, darling,” he said, “whatever happens we must keep Dorothy out of this.”

She looked at him blankly.

“But I don't understand. How can we?”

“Well, we can't only think of ourselves in this world. You know, other things being equal, there's nothing in this world I'd love more than to marry you. But it's quite out of the question. I know Dorothy: nothing would induce her to divorce me.”

Kitty was becoming horribly frightened. She began to cry again. He got up and sat down beside her with his arm round her waist.

“Try not to upset yourself, darling. We must keep our heads.”

“I thought you loved me… ”

“Of course I love you,” he said tenderly. “You surely can't have any doubt of that now.”

“If she won't divorce you Walter will make you corespondent.”

He took an appreciable time to answer. His tone was dry.

“Of course that would ruin my career, but I'm afraid it wouldn't do you much good. If the worst came to the worst I should make a clean breast of it to Dorothy; she'd be dreadfully hurt and wretched, but she'd forgive me.” He had an idea. “I'm not sure if the best plan wouldn't be to make a clean break of it anyhow. If she went to your husband I daresay she could persuade him to hold his tongue.”

“Does that mean you don't want her to divorce you?”

“Well, I have got my boys to think of, haven't I? And naturally I don't want to make her unhappy. We've always got on very well together. She's been an awfully good wife to me, you know.”

“Why did you tell me that she meant nothing to you?”

“I never did. I said I wasn't in love with her. We haven't slept together for years except now and then, on Christmas Day for instance, or the day before she was going home or the day she came back. She isn't a woman who cares for that sort of thing. But we've always been excellent friends. I don't mind telling you that I depend on her more than any one has any idea of.”

“Don't you think it would have been better to leave me alone then?”

She found it strange that with terror catching her breath she could speak so calmly.

“You were the loveliest little thing I'd seen for years. I just fell madly in love with you. You can't blame me for that.”

“After all, you said you'd never let me down.”

“But, good God, I'm not going to let you down. We've got in an awful scrape and I'm going to do everything that's humanly possible to get you out of it.”

“Except the one obvious and natural thing.”

He stood up and returned to his own chair.

“My dear, you must be reasonable. We'd much better face the situation frankly. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but really I must tell you the truth. I'm very keen on my career. There's no reason why I shouldn't be a Governor one of these days, and it's a damned soft job to be a Colonial Governor. Unless we can hush this up I don't stand a dog's chance. I may not have to leave the service, but there'll always be a black mark against me. If I do have to leave the service then I must go into business in China where I know people. In either case my only chance is for Dorothy to stick to me.”

“Was it necessary to tell me that you wanted nothing in the world but me?”

The corners of his mouth drooped peevishly.

“Oh, my dear, it's rather hard to take quite literally the things a man says when he's in love with you.”

“Didn't you mean them?”

“At the moment.”

“And what's to happen to me if Walter divorces me?”

“If we really haven't a leg to stand on of course we won't defend. There shouldn't be any publicity and people are pretty broad-minded nowadays.”

For the first time Kitty thought of her mother. She shivered. She looked again at Townsend. Her pain now was tinged with resentment.

“I'm sure you'd have no difficulty in bearing any inconvenience that I had to suffer,” she said.

“We're not going to get much further by saying disagreeable things to one another,” he answered.

She gave a cry of despair. It was dreadful that she should love him so devotedly and yet feel such bitterness towards him. It was not possible that he understood how much he meant to her.

“Oh, Charlie, don't you know how I love you?”

“But, my dear, I love you. Only we're not living in a desert island and we've got to make the best we can out of the circumstances that are forced upon us. You really must be reasonable.”

“How can I be reasonable? To me our love was everything and you were my whole life. It is not very pleasant to realise that to you it was only an episode.”

“Of course it wasn't an episode. But you know, when you ask me to get my wife, to whom I'm very much attached, to divorce me, and ruin my career by marrying you, you're asking a good deal.”

“No more than I'm willing to do for you.”

“The circumstances are rather different.”

“The only difference is that you don't love me.”

“One can be very much in love with a woman without wishing to spend the rest of one's life with her.”

She gave him a quick look and despair seized her. Heavy tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Oh, how cruel! How can you be so heartless?”

She began to sob hysterically. He gave an anxious glance at the door.

“My dear, do try and control yourself.”

“You don't know how I love you,” she gasped. “I can't live without you. Have you no pity for me?”

She could not speak any more. She wept without restraint.

“I don't want to be unkind, and Heaven knows I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I must tell you the truth.”

“It's the ruin of my whole life. Why couldn't you leave me alone? What harm had I ever done you?”

“Of course if it does you any good to put all the blame on me you may.”

Kitty blazed with sudden anger.

“I suppose I threw myself at your head. I suppose I gave you no peace till you yielded to my entreaties.”

“I don't say that. But I certainly should never have thought of making love to you if you hadn't made it perfectly clear that you were ready to be made love to.”

Oh, the shame of it! She knew that what he said was true. His face now was sullen and worried and his hands moved uneasily. Every now and then he gave her a little glance of exasperation.

“Won't your husband forgive you?” he said after a while.

“I never asked him.”

Instinctively he clenched his hands. She saw him suppress the exclamation of annoyance which came to his lips.

“Why don't you go to him and throw yourself on his mercy? If he's as much in love with you as you say he's bound to forgive you.”

“How little you know him!”





26


She wiped her eyes. She tried to pull herself together.

“Charlie, if you desert me I shall die.”

She was driven now to appeal to his compassion. She ought to have told him at once. When he knew the horrible alternative that was placed before her his generosity, his sense of justice, his manliness, would be so vehemently aroused that he would think of nothing but her danger. Oh, how passionately she desired to feel his dear, protecting arms around her!

“Walter wants me to go to Mei-tan-fu.”

“Oh, but that's the place where the cholera is. They've got the worst epidemic that they've had for fifty years. It's no place for a woman. You can't possibly go there.”

“If you let me down I shall have to.”

“What do you mean? I don't understand.”

“Walter is taking the place of the missionary doctor who died. He wants me to go with him.”

“When?”

“Now. At once.”

Townsend pushed back his chair and looked at her with puzzled eyes.

“I may be very stupid, but I can't make head or tail out of what you're saying. If he wants you to go to this place with him what about a divorce?”

“He's given me my choice. I must either go to Mei-tan-fu or else he'll bring an action.”

“Oh, I see.” Townsend's tone changed ever so slightly. “I think that's rather decent of him, don't you?”

“Decent?”

“Well, it's a damned sporting thing of him to go there. It's not a thing I'd fancy. Of course he'll get a C.M.G. for it when he comes back.”

“But me, Charlie?” she cried, with anguish in her voice.

“Well, I think if he wants you to go, under the circumstances I don't see how you can very well refuse.”

“It means death. Absolutely certain death.”

“Oh, damn it all, that's rather an exaggeration. He would hardly take you if he thought that. It's no more risk for you than for him. In point of fact there's no great risk if you're careful. I've been here when there's been cholera and I haven't turned a hair. The great thing is not to eat anything uncooked, no raw fruit or salads, or anything like that, and see that your drinking water is boiled.” He was gaining confidence as he proceeded, and his speech was fluent; he was even becoming less sullen and more alert; he was almost breezy. “After all, it's his job, isn't it? He's interested in bugs. It's rather a chance for him if you come to think of it.”

“But me, Charlie?” she repeated, not with anguish now, but with consternation.

“Well, the best way to understand a man is to put yourself in his shoes. From his point of view you've been rather a naughty little thing and he wants to get you out of harm's way. I always thought he never wanted to divorce you, he doesn't strike me as that sort of chap; but he made what he thought was a very generous offer and you put his back up by turning it down. I don't want to blame you, but really for all our sakes I think you ought to have given it a little consideration.”

“But don't you see it'll kill me? Don't you know that he's taking me there because he knows it'll kill me.”

“Oh, my dear, don't talk like that. We're in a damned awkward position and really it's no time to be melodramatic.”

“You've made up your mind not to understand.” Oh, the pain in her heart, and the fear! She could have screamed. “You can't send me to certain death. If you have no love or pity for me you must have just ordinary human feeling.”

“I think it's rather hard on me to put it like that. As far as I can make out your husband is behaving very generously. He's willing to forgive you if you'll let him. He wants to get you away and this opportunity has presented itself to take you to some place where for a few months you'll be out of harm's way. I don't pretend that Mei-tan-fu is a health resort, I never knew a Chinese city that was, but there's no reason to get the wind up about it. In fact that's the worst thing you can do. I believe as many people die from sheer fright in an epidemic as because they get infected.”

“But I'm frightened now. When Walter spoke of it I almost fainted.”

“At the first moment I can quite believe it was a shock, but when you come to look at it calmly you'll be all right. It'll be the sort of experience that not everyone has had.”

“I thought, I thought...”

She rocked to and fro in an agony. He did not speak, and once more his face wore that sullen look which till lately she had never known. Kitty was not crying now. She was dry-eyed, calm, and though her voice was low it was steady.

“Do you want me to go?”

“It's Hobson's choice, isn't it?”

“Is it?”

“It's only fair to you to tell you that if your husband brought an action for divorce and won it I should not be in a position to marry you.”

It must have seemed an age to him before she answered. She rose slowly to her feet.

“I don't think that my husband ever thought of bringing an action.”

“Then why in God's name have you been frightening me out of my wits?” he asked.

She looked at him coolly.

“He knew that you'd let me down.”

She was silent. Vaguely, as when you are studying a foreign language and read a page which at first you can make nothing of, till a word or a sentence gives you a clue; and on a sudden a suspicion, as it were, of the sense flashes across your troubled wits, vaguely she gained an inkling into the workings of Walter's mind. It was like a dark and ominous landscape seen by a flash of lightning and in a moment hidden again by the night. She shuddered at what she saw.

“He made that threat only because he knew that you'd crumple up at it, Charlie. It's strange that he should have judged you so accurately. It was just like him to expose me to such a cruel disillusion.”

Charlie looked down at the sheet of blotting paper in front of him. He was frowning a little and his mouth was sulky. But he did not reply.

“He knew that you were vain, cowardly and self-seeking. He wanted me to see it with my own eyes. He knew that you'd run like a hare at the approach of danger. He knew how grossly deceived I was in thinking that you were in love with me, because he knew that you were incapable of loving any one but yourself. He knew you'd sacrifice me without a pang to save your own skin.”

“If it really gives you any satisfaction to say beastly things to me I suppose I've got no right to complain. Women always are unfair and they generally manage to put a man in the wrong. But there is something to be said on the other side.”

She took no notice of his interruption.

“And now I know all that he knew. I know that you're callous and heartless, I know that you're selfish, selfish beyond words, and I know that you haven't the nerve of a rabbit, I know you're a liar and a humbug, I know that you're utterly contemptible. And the tragic part is”--her face was on a sudden distraught with pain--“the tragic part is that notwithstanding I love you with all my heart.”

“Kitty.”

She gave a bitter laugh. He had spoken her name in that melting, rich tone of his which came to him so naturally and meant so little.

“You fool,” she said.

He drew back quickly, flushing and offended; he could not make her out. She gave him a look in which there was a glint of amusement.

“You're beginning to dislike me, aren't you? Well, dislike me. It doesn't make any difference to me now.”

She began to put on her gloves.

“What are you going to do?” he asked.

“Oh, don't be afraid, you'll come to no harm. You'll be quite safe.”

“For God's sake, don't talk like that, Kitty,” he answered and his deep voice rang with anxiety. “You must know that everything that concerns you concerns me. I shall be frightfully anxious to know what happens. What are you going to say to your husband?”

“I'm going to tell him that I'm prepared to go to Mei-tan-fu with him.”

“Perhaps when you consent he won't insist.”

He could not have known why, when he said this, she looked at him so strangely.

“You're not really frightened?” he asked her.

“No,” she said. “You've inspired me with courage. To go into the midst of a cholera epidemic will be a unique experience and if I die it--well, I die.”

“I was trying to be as kind to you as I could.”

She looked at him again. Tears sprang into her eyes once more and her heart was very full. The impulse was almost irresistible to fling herself on his breast and crush her lips against his. It was no use.

“If you want to know,” she said, trying to keep her voice steady,“I go with death in my heart and fear. I do not know what Walter has in that dark, twisted mind of his, but I'm shaking with terror. I think it may be that death will be really a release.”

She felt that she could not hold on to her self-control for another moment. She walked swiftly to the door and let herself out before he had time to move from his chair. Townsend gave a long sigh of relief. He badly wanted a brandy and soda.





27


Walter was in when she got home. She would have liked to go straight to her room, but he was downstairs, in the hall, giving instructions to one of the boys. She was so wretched that she welcomed the humiliation to which she must expose herself. She stopped and faced him.

“I'm coming with you to that place,” she said.

“Oh, good.”

“When do you want me to be ready?”

“To-morrow night.”

She did not know what spirit of bravado entered into her. His indifference was like the prick of a spear. She said a thing that surprised herself.

“I suppose I needn't take more than a few summer things and a shroud, need I?”

She was watching his face and knew that her flippancy angered him.

“I've already told your amah what you'll want.”

She nodded and went up to her room. She was very pale.





28


They were reaching their destination at last. They were borne in chairs, day after day, along a narrow causeway between interminable rice-fields. They set out at dawn and travelled till the heat of the day forced them to take shelter in a wayside inn and then went on again till they reached the town where they had arranged to spend the night. Kitty's chair headed the procession and Walter followed her; then in a struggling line came the coolies that bore their bedding, stores, and equipment. Kitty passed through the country with unseeing eyes. All through the long hours, the silence broken only by an occasional remark from one of the bearers or a snatch of uncouth song, she turned over in her tortured mind the details of that heart-rending scene in Charlie's office. Recalling what he had said to her and what she had said to him, she was dismayed to see what an arid and business-like turn their conversation had taken. She had not said what she wanted to say and she had not spoken in the tone she intended. Had she been able to make him see her boundless love, the passion in her heart, and her helplessness, he could never have been so inhuman as to leave her to her fate. She had been taken unawares. She could hardly believe her ears when he told her, more clearly than with words, that he cared nothing for her. That was why she had not even cried very much, she had been so dazed. She had wept since, wept miserably.

At night in the inns, sharing the principal guest chamber with her husband and conscious that Walter, lying on his camp bed, a few feet away from her, lay awake, she dug her teeth in the pillow so that no sound might escape her. But in the day-time, protected by the curtains of her chair, she allowed herself to give way. Her pain was so great that she could have screamed at the top of her voice; she had never known that one could suffer so much; and she asked herself desperately what she had done to deserve it. She could not make out why Charlie did not love her: it was her fault, she supposed, but she had done everything she knew to make him fond of her. They had always got on so well, they laughed all the time they were together, they were not only lovers but good friends. She could not understand; she was broken. She told herself that she hated and despised him; but she had no idea how she was going to live if she was never to see him again. If Walter was taking her to Mei-tan-fu as a punishment he was making a fool of himself, for what did she care now what became of her? She had nothing to live for any more. It was rather hard to be finished with life at twenty-seven.





29


On the steamer that took them up the Western River Walter read incessantly, but at meal-times he endeavoured to make some kind of conversation. He talked to her as though she were a stranger with whom he happened to be making the journey, of indifferent things, from politeness, Kitty imagined, or because so he could render more marked the gulf that separated them.

In a flash of insight she had told Charlie that Walter had sent her to him with the threat of divorce as the alternative to her accompanying him to the stricken city in order that she might see for herself how indifferent, cowardly and selfish he was. It was true. It was a trick which accorded very well with his sardonic humour. He knew exactly what would happen and he had given her amah necessary instructions before her return. She had caught in his eyes a disdain which seemed to include her lover as well as herself. He said to himself, perhaps, that if he had been in Townsend's place nothing in the world would have hindered him from making any sacrifice to gratify her smallest whim. She knew that was true also. But then, when her eyes were opened, how could he make her do something which was so dangerous, and which he must know frightened her so terribly? At first she thought he was only playing with her and till they actually started, no, later, till they left the river and took to the chairs for the journey across country, she thought he would give that little laugh of his and tell her that she need not come. She had no inkling of what was in his mind. He could not really desire her death. He had loved her so desperately. She knew what love was now and she remembered a thousand signs of his adoration. For him really, in the French phrase, she did make fine weather and foul. It was impossible that he did not love her still. Did you cease to love a person because you had been treated cruelly? She had not made him suffer as Charlie had made her suffer and yet, if Charlie made a sign, notwithstanding everything, even though she knew him now, she would abandon all the world had to offer and fly to his arms. Even though he had sacrificed her and cared nothing for her, even though he was callous and unkind, she loved him.

At first she thought that she had only to bide her time, and sooner or later Walter would forgive her. She had been too confident of her power over him to believe that it was gone for ever. Many waters could not quench love. He was weak if he loved her, and felt that love her he must. But now she was not quite sure. When in the evening he sat reading in the straight-backed blackwood chair of the inn with the light of a hurricane lamp on his face she was able to watch him at her ease. She lay on the pallet on which her bed presently would be set and she was in shadow. Those straight, regular features of his made his face look very severe. You could hardly believe that it was possible for them on occasion to be changed by so sweet a smile. He was able to read as calmly as though she were a thousand miles away; she saw him turn the pages and she saw his eyes move regularly as they travelled from line to line. He was not thinking of her. And when, the table being set and dinner brought in, he put aside his book and gave her a glance (not knowing how the light on his face threw into distinctness his expression), she was startled to see in his eyes a look of physical distaste. Yes, it startled her. Was it possible that his love had left him entirely? Was it possible that he really designed her death? It was absurd. That would be the act of a madman. It was odd, the little shiver that ran through her as the thought occurred to her that perhaps Walter was not quite sane.





30


Suddenly her bearers, long silent, began to speak and one of them, turning round, with words she could not understand and with a gesture, sought to attract her attention. She looked in the direction he pointed and there, on the top of a hill, saw an archway; she knew by now that it was a memorial in compliment of a fortunate scholar or a virtuous widow, she had passed many of them since they left the river; but this one, silhouetted against the westering sun, was more fantastic and beautiful than any she had seen. Yet, she knew not why, it made her uneasy; it had a significance which she felt but could not put into words: Was it a menace that she vaguely discerned or was it derision? She was passing a grove of bamboos and they leaned over the causeway strangely as if they would detain her; though the summer evening was windless their narrow green leaves shivered a little. It gave her the sensation that some one hidden among them was watching her as she passed. Now they came to the foot of the hill and the rice-fields ceased. The bearers took it with a swinging stride. The hill was covered close with little green mounds, close, close to one another, so that the ground was ribbed like the sea-sand when the tide has gone out; and this she knew too, for she had passed just such a spot as they approached each populous city and left it. It was the graveyard. Now she knew why the bearers had called her attention to the archway that stood on the crest of the hill: they had reached the end of their journey.

They passed through the archway and the chair bearers paused to change the pole from shoulder to shoulder. One of them wiped his sweating face with a dirty rag. The causeway wound down. There were bedraggled houses on each side. Now the night was falling. But the bearers on a sudden broke into excited talk and with a jump that shook her ranged themselves as near as they could to the wall. In a moment she knew what had startled them, for as they stood there, chattering to one another, four peasants passed, quick and silent, bearing a new coffin, unpainted, and its fresh wood gleamed white in the approaching darkness. Kitty felt her heart beat in terror against her ribs. The coffin passed, but the bearers stood still; it seemed as though they could not summon up the will to go on. But there was a shout from behind and they started. They did not speak now.

They walked for a few minutes longer and then turned sharply into an open gateway. The chair was set down. She had arrived.





31


It was a bungalow and she entered the sitting-room. She sat down while the coolies, straggling in one by one, brought in their loads. Walter in the courtyard gave directions where this or that was to be placed. She was very tired. She was startled to hear an unknown voice.

“May I come in?”

She flushed and grew pale. She was overwrought and it made her nervous to meet a stranger. A man came out of the darkness, for the long low room was lit only by a shaded lamp, and held out his hand.

“My name is Waddington. I am the Deputy Commissioner.”

“Oh, the Customs. I know. I heard that you were here.”

In that dim light she could see only that he was a little thin man, no taller than she, with a bald head and a small, bare face.

“I live just at the bottom of the hill, but coming in this way you wouldn't have seen my house. I thought you'd be too fagged to come and dine with me, so I've ordered your dinner here and I've invited myself.”

“I'm delighted to hear it.”

“You'll find the cook's not bad. I kept on Watson's boys for you.”

“Watson was the missionary who was here?”

“Yes. Very nice fellow. I'll show you his grave tomorrow if you like.”

“How kind you are,” said Kitty, with a smile.

At that moment Walter came in. Waddington had introduced himself to him before coming in to see Kitty and now he said:

“I've just been breaking it to your missus that I'm dining with you. Since Watson died I haven't had anybody much to talk to but the nuns, and I can never do myself justice in French. Besides, there is only a limited number of subjects you can talk to them about.”

“I've just told the boy to bring in some drinks,” said Walter.

The servant brought whisky and soda and Kitty noticed that Waddington helped himself generously. His manner of speaking and his easy chuckle had suggested to her when he came in that he was not quite sober.

“Here's luck,” he said. Then, turning to Walter: “You've got your work cut out for you here. They're dying like flies. The magistrate's lost his head and Colonel Yü, the officer commanding the troops, is having a devil of a job to prevent them from looting. If something doesn't happen soon we shall all be murdered in our beds. I tried to get the nuns to go, but of course they wouldn't. They all want to be martyrs, damn them.”

He spoke lightly and there was in his voice a sort of ghostly laughter so that you could not listen to him without smiling.

“Why haven't you gone?” asked Walter.

“Well, I've lost half my staff and the others are ready to lie down and die at any minute. Somebody's got to stay and keep things together.”

“Have you been inoculated?”

“Yes. Watson did me. But he did himself too, and it didn't do him much good, poor blighter.” He turned to Kitty and his funny little face was gaily puckered. “I don't think there's any great risk if you take proper precautions. Have your milk and water boiled and don't eat fresh fruit or uncooked vegetables. Have you brought any gramophone records with you?”

“No, I don't think so,” said Kitty.

“I'm sorry for that. I was hoping you would. I haven't had any for a long time and I'm sick of my old ones.”

The boy came in to ask if they would have dinner.

“You won't dress to-night, will you?” asked Waddington. “My boy died last week and the boy I have now is a fool, so I haven't been dressing in the evening.”

“I'll go and take off my hat,” said Kitty.

Her room was next door to that in which they sat. It was barely furnished. An amah was kneeling on the floor, the lamp beside her, unpacking Kitty's things.





32


The dining-room was small and the greater part of it was filled by an immense table. On the walls were engravings of scenes from the Bible and illuminated texts.

“Missionaries always have large dining-tables,” Waddington explained. “They get so much a year more for every child they have and they buy their tables when they marry so that there shall be plenty of room for little strangers.”

From the ceiling hung a large paraffin lamp, so that Kitty was able to see better what sort of a man Waddington was. His baldness had deceived her into thinking him no longer young, but she saw now that he must be well under forty. His face, small under a high, rounded forehead, was unlined and fresh-coloured; it was ugly like a monkey's, but with an ugliness that was not without charm; it was an amusing face. His features, his nose and his mouth, were hardly larger than a child's, and he had small, very bright blue eyes. His eyebrows were fair and scanty. He looked like a funny little old boy. He helped himself constantly to liquor and as dinner proceeded it became evident that he was far from sober. But if he was drunk it was without offensiveness, gaily, as a satyr might be who had stolen a wine-skin from a sleeping shepherd.

He talked of Hong Kong; he had many friends there and he wanted to know about them. He had been down for the races a year before and he talked of ponies and their owners.

“By the way, what about Townsend?” he asked suddenly. “Is he going to become Colonial Secretary?”

Kitty felt herself flush, but her husband did not look at her.

“I shouldn't wonder,” he answered.

“He's the sort that gets on.”

“Do you know him?” asked Walter.

“Yes, I know him pretty well. We travelled out from home together once.”

From the other side of the river they heard the beating of gongs and the clatter of fire-crackers. There, so short a way from them, the great city lay in terror; and death, sudden and ruthless, hurried through its tortuous streets. But Waddington began to speak of London. He talked of the theatres. He knew everything that was being played at the moment and he told them what pieces he had seen when he was last home on leave. He laughed as he recollected the humour of this low comedian and sighed as he reflected on the beauty of that star of musical comedy. He was pleased to be able to boast that a cousin of his had married one of the most celebrated. He had lunched with her and she had given him her photograph. He would show it to them when they came and dined with him at the Customs.

Walter looked at his guest with a cold and ironic gaze, but he was evidently not a little amused by him, and he made an effort to show a civil interest in topics of which Kitty was well aware he knew nothing. A faint smile lingered on his lips. But Kitty, she knew not why, was filled with awe. In the house of that dead missionary, over against the stricken city, they seemed immeasurably apart from all the world. Three solitary creatures and strangers to each other.

Dinner was finished and she rose from the table.

“Do you mind if I say good night to you? I'm going to bed.”

“I'll take myself off, I expect the doctor wants to go to bed too,” answered Waddington. “We must be out early to-morrow.”

He shook hands with Kitty. He was quite steady on his feet, but his eyes were shining more than ever.

“I'll come and fetch you,” he told Walter, “and take you to see the Magistrate and Colonel Yü, and then we'll go along to the Convent. You've got your work cut out, I can tell you.”





33


Her night was tortured with strange dreams. She seemed to be carried in her chair and she felt the swaying motion as the bearers marched with their long, uneven stride. She entered cities, vast and dim, where the multitude thronged about her with curious eyes. The streets were narrow and tortuous and in the open shops, with their strange wares, all traffic stopped as she went by and those who bought and those who sold, paused. Then she came to the memorial arch and its fantastic outline seemed on a sudden to gain a monstrous life; its capricious contours were like the waving arms of a Hindu god, and, as she passed under it, she heard the echo of mocking laughter. But then Charlie Townsend came towards her and took her in his arms, lifting her out of the chair, and said it was all a mistake, he had never meant to treat her as he had, for he loved her and he couldn't live without her. She felt his kisses on her mouth and she wept with joy, asking him why he had been so cruel, but though she asked she knew it did not matter. And then there was a hoarse, abrupt cry and they were separated, and between, hurrying silently, coolies passed in their ragged blue and they bore a coffin.

She awoke with a start.

The bungalow stood half way down a steep hill and from her window she saw the narrow river below her and opposite, the city. The dawn had just broken and from the river rose a white mist shrouding the junks that lay moored close to one another like peas in a pod. There were hundreds of them, and they were silent, mysterious in that ghostly light, and you had a feeling that their crews lay under an enchantment, for it seemed that it was not sleep, but something strange and terrible, that held them so still and mute.

The morning drew on and the sun touched the mist so that it shone whitely like the ghost of snow on a dying star. Though on the river it was light so that you could discern palely the lines of the crowded junks and the thick forest of their masts, in front it was a shining wall the eye could not pierce. But suddenly from that white cloud a tall, grim, and massive bastion emerged. It seemed not merely to be made visible by the all-discovering sun but rather to rise out of nothing at the touch of a magic wand. It towered, the stronghold of a cruel and barbaric race, over the river. But the magician who built worked swiftly and now a fragment of coloured wall crowned the bastion; in a moment, out of the mist, looming vastly and touched here and there by a yellow ray of sun, there was seen a cluster of green and yellow roofs. Huge they seemed and you could make out no pattern; the order, if order there was, escaped you; wayward and extravagant, but of an unimaginable richness. This was no fortress, nor a temple, but the magic palace of some emperor of the gods where no man might enter. It was too airy, fantastic and unsubstantial to be the work of human hands; it was the fabric of a dream.

The tears ran down Kitty's face and she gazed, her hands clasped to her breast and her mouth, for she was breathless, open a little. She had never felt so light of heart and it seemed to her as though her body were a shell that lay at her feet and she pure spirit. Here was Beauty. She took it as the believer takes in his mouth the wafer which is God.





34


Since Walter went out early in the morning, came back at tiffin only for half an hour, and did not then return till dinner was just ready, Kitty found herself much alone. For some days she did not stir from the bungalow. It was very hot and for the most part she lay in a long chair by the open window, trying to read. The hard light of mid-day had robbed the magic palace of its mystery and now it was no more than a temple on the city wall, garish and shabby, but because she had seen it once in such an ecstasy it was never again quite common place; and often at dawn or at dusk, and again at night, she found herself able to recapture something of that beauty. What had seemed to her a mighty bastion was but the city wall and on this, massive and dark, her eyes rested continually. Behind its crenellations lay the city in the dread grip of the pestilence.

Vaguely she knew that terrible things were happening there, not from Walter who when she questioned him (for otherwise he rarely spoke to her) answered with a humorous nonchalance which sent a shiver down her spine; but from Waddington and from the amah. The people were dying at the rate of a hundred a day, and hardly any of those who were attacked by the disease recovered from it; the gods had been brought out from the abandoned temples and placed in the streets; offerings were laid before them and sacrifices made, but they did not stay the plague. The people died so fast that it was hardly possible to bury them. In some houses the whole family had been swept away and there was none to perform the funeral rites. The officer commanding the troops was a masterful man and if the city was not given over to riot and arson it was due to his determination. He forced his soldiers to bury such as there was no one else to bury and he had shot with his own hand an officer who demurred at entering a stricken house.

Kitty sometimes was so frightened that her heart sank within her and she would tremble in every limb. It was all very well to say that the risk was small if you took reasonable precautions: she was panic-stricken. She turned over in her mind crazy plans of escape. To get away, just to get away, she was prepared to set out as she was and make her way alone, without anything but what she stood up in, to some place of safety. She thought of throwing herself on the mercy of Waddington, telling him everything and beseeching him to help her to get back to Hong Kong. If she flung herself on her knees before her husband, and admitted that she was frightened, even though he hated her now he must have enough human feeling in him to pity her.

It was out of the question. If she went, where could she go? Not to her mother; her mother would make her see very plainly that, having married her off, she counted on being rid of her; and besides she did not want to go to her mother. She wanted to go to Charlie, and he did not want her. She knew what he would say if she suddenly appeared before him. She saw the sullen look of his face and the shrewd hardness behind his charming eyes. It would be difficult for him to find words that sounded well. She clenched her hands. She would have given anything to humiliate him as he had humiliated her. Sometimes she was seized with such a frenzy that she wished she had let Walter divorce her, ruining herself if only she could have ruined him too. Certain things he had said to her made her blush with shame when she recalled them.





35


The first time she was alone with Waddington she brought the conversation round to Charlie. Waddington had spoken of him on the evening of their arrival. She pretended that he was no more than an acquaintance of her husband.

“I never cared much for him,” said Waddington. “I've always thought him a bore.”

“You must be very hard to please,” returned Kitty, in the bright, chaffing way she could assume so easily. “I suppose he's far and away the most popular man in Hong Kong.”

“I know. That is his stock in trade. He's made a science of popularity. He has the gift of making everyone he meets feel that he is the one person in the world he wants to see. He's always ready to do a service that isn't any trouble to himself, and even if he doesn't do what you want he manages to give you the impression that it's only because it's not humanly possible.”

“That is surely an attractive trait.”

“Charm and nothing but charm at last grows a little tiresome, I think. It's a relief then to deal with a man who isn't quite so delightful but a little more sincere. I've known Charlie Townsend for a good many years and once or twice I've caught him with the mask off--you see, I never mattered, just a subordinate official in the Customs--and I know that he doesn't in his heart give a damn for any one in the world but himself.”

Kitty, lounging easily in her chair, looked at him with smiling eyes. She turned her wedding-ring round and round her finger.

“Of course he'll get on. He knows all the official ropes. Before I die I have every belief that I shall address him as Your Excellency and stand up when he enters the room.”

“Most people think he deserves to get on. He's generally supposed to have a great deal of ability.”

“Ability? What nonsense! He's a very stupid man. He gives you the impression that he dashes off his work and gets it through from sheer brilliancy. Nothing of the kind. He's as industrious as a Eurasian clerk.”

“How has he got the reputation of being so clever?”

“There are many foolish people in the world and when a man in a rather high position puts on no frills, slaps them on the back, and tells them he'll do anything in the world for them, they are very likely to think him clever. And then of course, there's his wife. There's an able woman if you like. She has a good sound head and her advice is always worth taking. As long as Charlie Townsend's got her to depend on he's pretty safe never to do a foolish thing, and that's the first thing necessary for a man to get on in Government service. They don't want clever men; clever men have ideas, and ideas cause trouble; they want men who have charm and tact and who can be counted on never to make a blunder. Oh, yes, Charlie Townsend will get to the top of the tree all right.”

“I wonder why you dislike him?”

“I don't dislike him.”

“But you like his wife better?” smiled Kitty.

“I'm an old-fashioned little man and I like a well-bred woman.”

“I wish she were well-dressed as well as well-bred.”

“Doesn't she dress well? I never noticed.”

“I've always heard that they were a devoted couple,” said Kitty, watching him through her eye-lashes.

“He's very fond of her: I will give him that credit. I think that is the most decent thing about him.”

“Cold praise.”

“He has his little flirtations, but they're not serious. He's much too cunning to let them go to such lengths as might cause him inconvenience. And of course he isn't a passionate man; he's only a vain one. He likes admiration. He's fat and forty now, he does himself too well, but he was very good-looking when he first came to the Colony. I've often heard his wife chaff him about his conquests.”

“She doesn't take his flirtations very seriously?”

“Oh, no, she knows they don't go very far. She says she'd like to be able to make friends of the poor little things who fall to Charlie; but they're always so common. She says it's really not very flattering to her that the women who fall in love with her husband are so uncommonly second-rate.”

When Waddington left her Kitty thought over what he had so carelessly said. It hadn't been very pleasant to hear and she had had to make something of an effort not to show how much it touched her. It was bitter to think that all he said was true. She knew that Charlie was stupid and vain, hungry for flattery, and she remembered the complacency with which he had told her little stories to prove his cleverness. He was proud of a low cunning. How worthless must she be if she had given her heart so passionately to such a man because--because he had nice eyes and a good figure! She wished to despise him, because so long as she only hated him she knew that she was very near loving him. The way he had treated her should have opened her eyes. Walter had always held him in contempt. Oh, if she could only get him out of her mind altogether! And had his wife chaffed him about her obvious infatuation for him? Dorothy would have liked to make a friend of her, but that she found her second-rate. Kitty smiled a little: how indignant her mother would be to know that her daughter was considered that!

But at night she dreamt of him again. She felt his arms pressing her close and the hot passion of his kisses on her lips. What did it matter if he was fat and forty? She laughed with soft affection because he minded so much; she loved him all the more for his childlike vanity and she could be sorry for him and comfort him. When she awoke tears were streaming from her eyes.

She did not know why it seemed to her so tragic to cry in her sleep.





37


She saw Waddington every day, for he strolled up the hill to the Fanes' bungalow when his day's work was done; and so after a week they had arrived at an intimacy which under other circumstances they could scarcely have achieved in a year. Once when Kitty told him she didn't know what she would do there without him he answered, laughing:

“You see, you and I are the only people here who walk quite quietly and peaceably on solid ground. The nuns walk in heaven and your husband--in darkness.”

Though she gave a careless laugh she wondered what he meant. She felt that his merry little blue eyes were scanning her face with an amiable, but disconcerting attention. She had discovered already that he was shrewd and she had a feeling that the relations between herself and Walter excited his cynical curiosity. She found a certain amusement in baffling him. She liked him and she knew that he was kindly disposed towards her. He was not witty nor brilliant, but he had a dry and incisive way of putting things which was diverting, and his funny, boyish face under that bald skull, all screwed up with laughter, made his remarks sometimes extremely droll. He had lived for many years in outports, often with no man of his own color to talk to, and his personality had developed in eccentric freedom. He was full of fads and oddities. His frankness was refreshing. He seemed to look upon life in a spirit of banter, and his ridicule of the Colony at Hong Kong was acid; but he laughed also at the Chinese officials at Mei-tan-fu and at the cholera which decimated the city. He could not tell a tragic story or one of heroism without making it faintly absurd. He had many anecdotes of his adventures during twenty years in China, and you concluded from them that the earth was a very grotesque, bizarre and ludicrous place.

Though he denied that he was a Chinese scholar (he swore that the Sinologues were as mad as march hares) he spoke the language with ease. He read little and what he knew he had learned from conversation. But he often told Kitty stories from the Chinese novels and from Chinese history and though he told them with that airy badinage which was natural to him it was good-humoured and even tender. It seemed to her that, perhaps unconsciously, he had adopted the Chinese view that the Europeans were barbarians and their life a folly: in China alone was it so led that a sensible man might discern in it a sort of reality. Here was food for reflection: Kitty had never heard the Chinese spoken of as anything but decadent, dirty and unspeakable. It was as though the corner of a curtain were lifted for a moment, and she caught a glimpse of a world rich with a color and significance she had not dreamt of.

He sat there, talking, laughing, and drinking.

“Don't you think you drink too much?” said Kitty to him boldly.

“It's my great pleasure in life,” he answered. “Besides, it keeps the cholera out.”

When he left her he was generally drunk, but he carried his liquor well. It made him hilarious, but not disagreeable.

One evening Walter, coming back earlier than usual, asked him to stay to dinner. A curious incident happened. They had their soup and their fish and then with the chicken a fresh green salad was handed to Kitty by the boy.

“Good God, you're not going to eat that,” cried Waddington, as he saw Kitty take some.

“Yes, we have it every night.”

“My wife likes it,” said Walter.

The dish was handed to Waddington, but he shook his head.

“Thank you very much, but I'm not thinking of committing suicide just yet.”

Walter smiled grimly and helped himself. Waddington said nothing more, in fact he became strangely taciturn, and soon after dinner he left them.

It was true that they ate salad every night. Two days after their arrival the cook, with the unconcern of the Chinese, had sent it in and Kitty, without thinking, took some. Walter leaned forward quickly.

“You oughtn't to eat that. The boy's crazy to serve it.”

“Why not?” asked Kitty, looking at him full in the face.

“It's always dangerous, it's madness now. You'll kill yourself.”

“I thought that was the idea,” said Kitty.

She began to eat it coolly. She was seized with she knew not what spirit of bravado. She watched Walter with mocking eyes. She thought that he grew a trifle pale, but when the salad was handed to him he helped himself. The cook, finding they did not refuse it, sent them some in every day and every day, courting death, they ate it. It was grotesque to take such a risk. Kitty, in terror of the disease, took it with the feeling not only that she was thus maliciously avenging herself on Walter, but that she was flouting her own desperate fears.





38


It was the day after this that Waddington, coming to the bungalow in the afternoon, when he had sat a little asked Kitty if she would not go for a stroll with him. She had not been out of the compound since their arrival. She was glad enough.

“There are not many walks, I'm afraid,” he said. “But we'll go to the top of the hill.”

“Oh, yes, where the archway is. I've seen it often from the terrace.”

One of the boys opened the heavy doorway for them and they stepped out into the dusty lane. They walked a few yards and then Kitty, seizing Waddington's arm in fright, gave a startled cry.

“Look!”

“What's the matter?”

At the foot of the wall that surrounded the compound a man lay on his back with his legs stretched out and his arms thrown over his head. He wore the patched blue rags and the wild mop of hair of the Chinese beggar.

“He looks as if he were dead,” Kitty gasped.

“He is dead. Come along; you'd better look the other way. I'll have him moved when we come back.”

But Kitty was trembling so violently that she could not stir.

“I've never seen any one dead before.”

“You'd better hurry up and get used to it then, because you'll see a good many before you've done with this cheerful spot.”

He took her hand and drew it in his arm. They walked for a little in silence.

“Did he die of cholera?” she said at last.

“I suppose so.”

They walked up the hill till they came to the archway. It was richly carved. Fantastic and ironical it stood like a landmark in the surrounding country. They sat down on the pedestal and faced the wide plain. The hill was sown close with the little green mounds of the dead, not in lines but disorderly, so that you felt that beneath the surface they must strangely jostle one another. The narrow causeway meandered sinuously among the green rice-fields. A small boy seated on the neck of a water-buffalo drove it slowly home, and three peasants in wide straw hats lolloped with sidelong gait under their heavy loads. After the heat of the day it was pleasant in that spot to catch the faint breeze of the evening and the wide expanse of country brought a sense of restful melancholy to the tortured heart. But Kitty could not rid her mind of the dead beggar.

“How can you talk and laugh and drink whisky when people are dying all around you?” she asked suddenly.

Waddington did not answer. He turned round and looked at her, then he put his hand on her arm.

“You know, this is no place for a woman,” he said gravely. “Why don't you go?”

She gave him a sidelong glance from beneath her long lashes and there was the shadow of a smile on her lips.

“I should have thought under the circumstances a wife's place was by her husband's side.”

“When they telegraphed to me that you were coming with Fane I was astonished. But then it occurred to me that perhaps you'd been a nurse and all this sort of thing was in the day's work. I expected you to be one of those grim-visaged females who lead you a dog's life when you're ill in hospital. You could have knocked me down with a feather when I came into the bungalow and saw you sitting down and resting. You looked very frail and white and tired.”

“You couldn't expect me to look my best after nine days on the road.”

“You look frail and white and tired now, and if you'll allow me to say so, desperately unhappy.”

Kitty flushed because she could not help it, but she was able to give a laugh that sounded merry enough.

“I'm sorry you don't like my expression. The only reason I have for looking unhappy is that since I was twelve I've known that my nose was a little too long. But to cherish a secret sorrow is a most effective pose: you can't think how many sweet young men have wanted to console me.”

Waddington's blue and shining eyes rested on her and she knew that he did not believe a word she said. She did not care so long as he pretended to.

“I knew that you hadn't been married very long and I came to the conclusion that you and your husband were madly in love with each other. I couldn't believe that he had wished you to come, but perhaps you had absolutely refused to stay behind.”

“That's a very reasonable explanation,” she said lightly.

“Yes, but it isn't the right one.”

She waited for him to go on, fearful of what he was about to say, for she had a pretty good idea of his shrewdness and was aware that he never hesitated to speak his mind, but unable to resist the desire to hear him talk about herself.

“I don't think for a moment that you're in love with your husband. I think you dislike him, I shouldn't be surprised if you hated him. But I'm quite sure you're afraid of him.”

For a moment she looked away. She did not mean to let Waddington see that anything he said affected her.

“I have a suspicion that you don't very much like my husband,” she said with cool irony.

“I respect him. He has brains and character; and that, I may tell you, is a very unusual combination. I don't suppose you know what he is doing here, because I don't think he's very expansive with you. If any man single handed can put a stop to this frightful epidemic he's going to do it. He's doctoring the sick, cleaning the city up, trying to get the drinking water pure. He doesn't mind where he goes nor what he does. He's risking his life twenty times a day. He's got Colonel Yü in his pocket and he's induced him to put the troops at his disposal. He's even put a little pluck into the magistrate and the old man is really trying to do something. And the nuns at the convent swear by him. They think he's a hero.”

“Don't you?”

“After all this isn't his job, is it? He's a bacteriologist. There was no call for him to come here. He doesn't give me the impression that he's moved by compassion for all these dying Chinamen. Watson was different. He loved the human race. Though he was a missionary it didn't make any difference to him if they were Christian, Buddhist, or Confucian; they were just human beings. Your husband isn't here because he cares a damn if a hundred thousand Chinese die of cholera; he isn't here either in the interests of science. Why is he here?”

“You'd better ask him.”

“It interests me to see you together. I sometimes wonder how you behave when you're alone. When I'm there you're acting, both of you, and acting damned badly, by George. You'd neither of you get thirty bob a week in a touring company if that's the best you can do.”

“I don't know what you mean,” smiled Kitty, keeping up a pretence of frivolity which she knew did not deceive.

“You're a very pretty woman. It's funny that your husband should never look at you. When he speaks to you it sounds as though it were not his voice but somebody else's.”

“Do you think he doesn't love me?” asked Kitty in a low voice, hoarsely, putting aside suddenly her lightness.

“I don't know. I don't know if you fill him with such a repulsion that it gives him goose-flesh to be near you or if he's burning with a love that for some reason he will not allow himself to show. I've asked myself if you're both here to commit suicide.”

Kitty had seen the startled glance and then the scrutinising look Waddington gave them when the incident of the salad took place.

“I think you're attaching too much importance to a few lettuce leaves,” she said flippantly. She rose. “Shall we go home? I'm sure you want a whisky and soda.”

“You're not a heroine at all events. You're frightened to death. Are you sure you don't want to go away?”

“What has it got to do with you?”

“I'll help you.”

“Are you going to fall to my look of secret sorrow? Look at my profile and tell me if my nose isn't a trifle too long.”

He gazed at her reflectively, that malicious, ironical look in his bright eyes, but mingled with it, a shadow, like a tree standing at a river's edge and its reflection in the water, was an expression of singular kindliness. It brought sudden tears to Kitty's eyes.

“Must you stay?”

“Yes.”

They passed under the flamboyant archway and walked down the hill. When they came to the compound they saw the body of the dead beggar. He took her arm, but she released herself. She stood still.

“It's dreadful, isn't it?”

“What? Death.”

“Yes. It makes everything else seem so horribly trivial. He doesn't look human. When you look at him you can hardly persuade yourself that he's ever been alive. It's hard to think that not so very many years ago he was just a little boy tearing down the hill and flying a kite.”

She could not hold back the sob that choked her.





39


A few days later Waddington, sitting with Kitty, a long glass of whisky and soda in his hand, began to speak to her of the convent.

“The Mother Superior is a very remarkable woman,” he said.“The Sisters tell me that she belongs to one of the greatest families in France, but they won't tell me which; the Mother Superior, they say, doesn't wish it to be talked of.”

“Why don't you ask her if it interests you?” smiled Kitty.

“If you knew her you'd know it was impossible to ask her an indiscreet question.”

“She must certainly be very remarkable if she can impress you with awe.”

“I am the bearer of a message from her to you. She has asked me to say that, though of course you may not wish to adventure into the very centre of the epidemic, if you do not mind that it will give her great pleasure to show you the convent.”

“It's very kind of her. I shouldn't have thought she was aware of my existence.”

“I've spoken about you; I go there two or three times a week just now to see if there's anything I can do; and I dare say your husband has told them about you. You must be prepared to find that they have an unbounded admiration for him.”

“Are you a Catholic?”

His malicious eyes twinkled and his funny little face was puckered with laughter.

“Why are you grinning at me?” asked Kitty.

“Can any good come out of Galilee? No, I'm not a Catholic. I describe myself as a member of the Church of England, which I suppose is an inoffensive way of saying that you don't believe in anything very much… When the Mother Superior came here ten years ago she brought seven nuns with her and of those all but three are dead. You see, at the best of times, Mei-tan-fu is not a health resort. They live in the very middle of the city, in the poorest district, they work very hard and they never have a holiday.”

“But there are only three and the Mother Superior now?”

“Oh, no, more have taken their places. There are six of them now. When one of them died of cholera at the beginning of the epidemic two others came up from Canton.”

Kitty shivered a little.

“Are you cold?”

“No, it was only someone walking over my grave.”

“When they leave France they leave it for ever. They're not like the Protestant missionaries who have a year's leave every now and then. I always think that must be the hardest thing of all. We English have no very strong attachment to the soil, we can make ourselves at home in any part of the world, but the French, I think, have an attachment to their country which is almost a physical bond. They're never really at ease when they're out of it. It always seems to me very moving that these women should make just that sacrifice. I suppose if I were a Catholic it would seem very natural to me.”

Kitty looked at him coolly. She could not quite understand the emotion with which the little man spoke and she asked herself whether it was a pose. He had drunk a good deal of whisky and perhaps he was not quite sober.

“Come and see for yourself,” he said, with his bantering smile, quickly reading her thought. “It's not nearly so risky as eating a tomato.”

“If you're not frightened there's no reason why I should be.”

“I think it'll amuse you. It's like a little bit of France.”





40


They crossed the river in a sampan. A chair was waiting for Kitty at the landing-stage and she was carried up the hill to the water-gate. It was through this that the coolies came to fetch water from the river and they hurried to and fro with huge buckets hanging from the yoke on their shoulder, splashing the causeway so that it was as wet as though it had heavily rained. Kitty's bearers gave short, sharp cries to urge them to make way.

“Of course all business is at a standstill,” said Waddington, walking by her side. “Under normal circumstances you have to fight you way through the coolies carrying loads up and down to the junks.”

The street was narrow and winding so that Kitty lost all sense of the direction in which she was going. Many of the shops were closed. She had grown used on the journey up to the untidiness of a Chinese street, but here was the litter of weeks, garbage and refuse; and the stench was so horrible that she had to put her handkerchief to her face. Passing through Chinese cities she had been incommoded by the staring of the crowd, but now she noticed that no more than an indifferent glance was thrown at her. The passers-by, scattered rather than as usual thronging, seemed intent on their own affairs. They were cowed and listless. Now and then as they went by a house they heard the beating of gongs and the shrill, sustained lament of unknown instruments. Behind those closed doors one was lying dead.

“Here we are,” said Waddington at last.

The chair was set down at a small doorway, surmounted by a cross, in a long white wall, and Kitty stepped out. He rang the bell.

“You musn't expect anything very grand, you know. They're miserably poor.”

The door was opened by a Chinese girl, and after a word or two from Waddington she led them into a little room on the side of the corridor. It contained a large table covered with a chequered oilcloth and round the walls was a set of stiff chairs. At one end of the room was a statue, in plaster, of the Blessed Virgin. In a moment a nun came in, short and plump, with a homely face, red cheeks, and merry eyes. Waddington, introducing Kitty to her, called her Soeur St. Joseph.

“C'est la dame du docteur?” she asked, beaming, and then added that the Mother Superior would join them directly.

Sister St. Joseph could speak no English and Kitty's French was halting; but Waddington, fluent, voluble, and inaccurate, maintained a stream of facetious comment which convulsed the good-humoured nun. Her cheerful, easy laughter not a little astonished Kitty. She had an idea that the religious were always grave and this sweet and childlike merriment touched her.





41


The door opened, to Kitty's fancy not quite naturally but as though it swung back of itself on its hinges, and the Mother Superior entered the little room. She stood for an instant on the threshold and a grave smile hovered upon her lips as she looked at the laughing Sister and Waddington's puckered, clownish face. Then she came forward and held out her hand to Kitty.

“Mrs. Fane?” She spoke in English with a good deal of accent, but with a correct pronunciation, and she gave the shadow of a bow.“It is a great pleasure to me to make the acquaintance of the wife of our good and brave doctor.”

Kitty felt that the Superior's eyes held her in a long and unembarrassed look of appraisal. It was so frank that it was not uncivil; you felt that here was a woman whose business it was to form an opinion of others and to whom it never occurred that subterfuge was necessary. With a dignified affability she motioned to her visitors to take chairs and herself sat down. Sister St. Joseph, smiling still but silent, stood at the side but a little behind the Superior.

“I know you English like tea,” said the Mother Superior, “and I have ordered some. But I must make my excuses if it is served in the Chinese fashion. I know that Mr. Waddington prefers whisky, but that I am afraid I cannot offer him.”

She smiled and there was a hint of malice in her grave eyes.

“Oh, come, ma mère, you speak as if I were a confirmed drunkard.”

“I wish you could say that you never drink, Mr. Waddington.”

“I can at all events say that I never drink except to excess.”

The Mother Superior laughed and translated into French for Sister St. Joseph the flippant remark. She looked at him with lingering, friendly eyes.

“We must make allowances for Mr. Waddington because two or three times when we had no money at all and did not know how we were to feed our orphans Mr. Waddington came to our rescue.”

The convert who had opened the door for them now came in with a tray on which were Chinese cups, a teapot, and a little plate of the French cakes called madeleines.

“You must eat the madeleines,” said the Mother Superior,“because Sister St. Joseph made them for you herself this morning.”

They talked of commonplace things. The Mother Superior asked Kitty how long she had been in China and if the journey from Hong Kong had greatly tired her. She asked her if she had been in France and if she did not find the climate of Hong Kong trying. It was a conversation, trivial but friendly, which gained a peculiar savior from the circumstances. The parlour was very quiet, so that you could hardly believe that you were in the midst of the populous city. Peace dwelt there. And yet all round about the epidemic was raging and the people, terrified and restless, were kept in check but by the strong will of a soldier who was more than half a brigand. Within the convent walls the infirmary was crowded with sick and dying soldiers, and of the orphans in the nuns' charge a quarter were dead.

Kitty, impressed she hardly knew why, observed the grave lady who asked her these amiable questions. She was dressed in white and the only color on her habit was the red heart that burned on her breast. She was a woman of middle age, she might have been forty or fifty, it was impossible to say, for there were few wrinkles on her smooth, pale face, and you received the impression that she was far from young chiefly from the dignity of her bearing, her assurance, and the emaciation of her strong and beautiful hands. The face was long, with a large mouth and large, even teeth; the nose, though not small, was delicate and sensitive; but it was the eyes, under their thin black brows, which gave her face its intense and tragic character. They were very large, black, and though not exactly cold, by their calm steadiness strangely compelling. Your first thought when you looked at the Mother Superior was that as a girl she must have been beautiful, but in a moment you realised that this was a woman whose beauty, depending on character, had grown with advancing years. Her voice was deep, low and controlled, and whether she spoke in English or in French she spoke slowly. But the most striking thing about her was the air she had of authority tempered by Christian charity; you felt in her the habit of command. To be obeyed was natural to her, but she accepted obedience with humility. You could not fail to see that she was deeply conscious of the authority of the church which upheld her. But Kitty had a surmise that notwithstanding her austere demeanour she had for human frailty a human tolerance; and it was impossible to look at her grave smile when she listened to Waddington, unabashed, talking nonsense, without being sure that she had a lively sense of the ridiculous.

But there was some other quality in her which Kitty vaguely felt, but could not put a name to. It was something that notwithstanding the Mother Superior's cordiality and the exquisite manners which made Kitty feel like an awkward schoolgirl, held her at a distance.





42


“Monsieur ne mange rien,” said Sister St. Joseph.

“Monsieur's palate is ruined by Manchu cooking,” replied the Mother Superior.

The smile left Sister St. Joseph's face and she assumed an expression of some primness. Waddington, a roguish glance in his eyes, took another cake. Kitty did not understand the incident.

“To prove to you how unjust you are, ma mère,I will ruin the excellent dinner that awaits me.”

“If Mrs. Fane would like to see over the convent I shall be glad to show her.” The Mother Superior turned to Kitty with a deprecating smile. “I am sorry you should see it just now when everything is in disorder. We have so much work and not enough Sisters to do it. Colonel Yü has insisted on our putting our infirmary at the disposal of sick soldiers and we have had to make the réfectoire into an infirmary for our orphans.”

She stood at the door to allow Kitty to pass and together, followed by Sister St. Joseph and Waddington, they walked along cool white corridors. They went first into a large, bare room where a number of Chinese girls were working at elaborate embroideries. They stood up when the visitors entered and the Mother Superior showed Kitty specimens of the work.

“We go on with it notwithstanding the epidemic because it takes their minds off the danger.”

They went to a second room in which younger girls were doing plain sewing, hemming and stitching, and then into a third where there were only tiny children under the charge of a Chinese covert. They were playing noisily and when the Mother Superior came in they crowded round her, mites of two and three, with their black Chinese eyes and their black hair; and they seized her hands and hid themselves in her great skirts. An enchanting smile lit up her grave face, and she fondled them; she spoke little chaffing words which Kitty, ignorant though she was of Chinese, could tell were like caresses. She shuddered a little, for in their uniform dress, sallow-skinned, stunted, with their flat noses, they looked to her hardly human. They were repulsive. But the Mother Superior stood among them like Charity itself. When she wished to leave the room they would not let her go, but clung to her, so that, with smiling expostulations, she had to use a gentle force to free herself. They at all events found nothing terrifying in this great lady.

“You know of course,” she said, as they walked along another corridor, “that they are only orphans in the sense that their parents have wished to be rid of them. We give them a few cash for every child that is brought in, otherwise they will not take the trouble, but do away with them.” She turned to the Sister. “Have any come to-day?” she asked.

“Four.”

“Now, with the cholera, they are more than ever anxious not to be burdened with useless girls.”

She showed Kitty the dormitories and then they passed a door on which was painted the word infirmerie. Kitty heard groans and loud cries and sounds as though beings not human were in pain.

“I will not show you the infirmary,” said the Mother Superior in her placid tones. “It is not a sight that one would wish to see.” A thought struck her. “I wonder if Dr. Fane is there?”

She looked interrogatively at the Sister and she, with her merry smile, opened the door and slipped in. Kitty shrank back as the open door allowed her to hear more horribly the turmult within. Sister St. Joseph came back.

“No, he has been and will not be back again till later.”

“What about number six?”

“Pauvre garçon, he's dead.”

The Mother Superior crossed herself and her lips moved in a short and silent prayer.

They passed by a courtyard and Kitty's eyes fell upon two long shapes that lay side by side on the ground covered with a piece of blue cotton. The Superior turned to Waddington.

“We are so short of beds that we have to put two patients in one and the moment a sick man dies he must be bundled out in order to make room for another.” But she gave Kitty a smile. “Now we will show you our chapel. We are very proud of it. One of our friends in France sent us a little while ago a life-size statue of the Blessed Virgin.”





43


The chapel was no more than a long low room with whitewashed walls and rows of deal benches; at the end was the altar on which stood the image; it was in plaster of Paris painted in crude colors; it was very bright and new and garish. Behind it was a picture in oils of the Crucifixion with the two Marys at the foot of the Cross in extravagant attitudes of grief. The drawing was bad and the dark pigments were put on with an eye that knew nothing of the beauty of color. Around the walls were the Stations of the Cross painted by the same unfortunate hand. The chapel was hideous and vulgar.

The nuns on entering knelt down to say a prayer and then, rising, the Mother Superior began once more to chat with Kitty.

“Everything that can be broken is broken when it comes here, but the statue presented to us by our benefactor came from Paris without so much as the smallest chip. There is no doubt that it was a miracle.”

Waddington's malicious eyes gleamed, but he held his tongue.

“The altarpiece and the Stations of the Cross were painted by one of our Sisters, Soeur St. Anselme.” The Mother Superior crossed herself. “She was a real artist. Unfortunately, she fell a victim to the epidemic. Do you not think that they are very beautiful?”

Kitty faltered an affirmative. On the altar were bunches of paper flowers and the candlesticks were distractingly ornate.

“We have the privilege of keeping here the Blessed Sacrament.”

“Yes?” said Kitty, not understanding.

“It has been a great comfort to us during this time of so terrible trouble.”

They left the chapel and retraced their steps to the parlour in which they had first sat.

“Would you like to see the babies that came in this morning before you go?”

“Very much,” said Kitty.

The Mother Superior led them into a tiny room on the other side of the passage. On a table, under a cloth, there was a singular wriggling. The Sister drew back the cloth and displayed four tiny, naked infants. They were very red and they made funny restless movements with their arms and legs; their quaint little Chinese faces were screwed up into strange grimaces. They looked hardly human; queer animals of an unknown species, and yet there was something singularly moving in the sight. The Mother Superior looked at them with an amused smile.

“They seem very lively. Sometimes they are brought in only to die. Of course we baptize them the moment they come.”

“The lady's husband will be pleased with them,” said Sister St. Joseph. “I think he could play by the hour with the babies. When they cry he has only to take them up, and he makes them comfortable in the crook of his arm, so that they laugh with delight.”

Then Kitty and Waddington found themselves at the door. Kitty gravely thanked the Mother Superior for the trouble she had taken. The nun bowed with a condescension that was at once dignified and affable.

“It has been a great pleasure. You do not know how kind and helpful your husband has been to us. He has been sent to us by Heaven. I am glad that you came with him. When he goes home it must be a great comfort to him to have you there with your love and your--your sweet face. You must take care of him and not let him work too hard. You must look after him for all our sakes.”

Kitty flushed. She did not know what to say. The Mother Superior held out her hand and while she held it Kitty was conscious of those cool, thoughtful eyes which rested on her with detachment and yet with something that looked like a profound understanding.

Sister St. Joseph closed the door behind them and Kitty got into her chair. They went back through the narrow, winding streets. Waddington made a casual remark: Kitty did not answer. He looked round, but the side curtains of the chair were drawn and he could not see her. He walked on in silence. But when they reached the river and she stepped out, to his surprise he saw that her eyes were streaming with tears.

“What is the matter?” he asked, his face puckered into an expression of dismay.

“Nothing.” She tried to smile. “Only foolishness.”

Alone once more in the sordid parlor of the dead missionary, lying on the long chair that faced the window, her abstracted eyes on the temple across the river (now again at the approach of evening aerial and lovely), Kitty tried to set in order the feelings in her heart. She would never have believed that this visit to the convent could so have moved her. She had gone from curiosity. She had nothing else to do and after looking for so many days at the walled city across the water she was not unwilling to have at least a glimpse of its mysterious streets.

But once within the convent it had seemed to her that she was transported into another world situated strangely neither in space nor time. Those bare rooms and the white corridors, austere and simple, seemed to possess the spirit of something remote and mystical. The little chapel, so ugly and vulgar, in its very crudeness was pathetic; it had something which was wanting in the greatness of a cathedral, with its stained glass and its pictures: it was very humble; and the faith which had adorned it, the affection which cherished it, had endured it with a delicate beauty of the soul. The methodical way in which the convent's work was carried on in the midst of the pestilence showed a coolness in the face of danger and a practical sense, almost ironical it was so matter of fact, which were deeply impressive. In Kitty's ears rang still the ghastly sounds she heard when for a moment Sister St. Joseph opened the infirmary door.

It was unexpected the way they had spoken of Walter. First the Sister and then the Mother Superior herself, and the tone of her voice had been very gentle when she praised him. Oddly enough it gave her a little thrill of pride to know that they thought so well of him. Waddington also had told something of what Walter was doing; but it was not only his competence that the nuns praised (in Hong Kong she had known that he was thought clever), they spoke of his thoughtfulness and his tenderness. Of course he could be very tender. He was at his best when you were ill; he was too intelligent to exasperate, and his touch was pleasant, cool and soothing. By some magic he seemed able by his mere presence to relieve your suffering. She knew that she would never see again in his eyes the look of affection which she had once been so used to that she found it merely exasperating. She knew now how immense was his capacity for loving; in some odd way he was pouring it out on these wretched sick who had only him to look to. She did not feel jealousy, but a sense of emptiness; it was as though a support that she had grown so accustomed to as not to realise its presence were suddenly withdrawn from her so that she swayed this way and that like a thing that was top-heavy.

She had only contempt for herself because once she had felt contempt for Walter. He must have known how she regarded him and he had accepted her estimate without bitterness. She was a fool and he knew it and because he loved her it had made no difference to him. She did not hate him now, nor feel resentment of him, but fear rather and perplexity. She could not admit but that he had remarkable qualities, sometimes she thought that there was even in him a strange and unattractive greatness; it was curious then that she could not love him, but loved still a man whose worthlessness was now so clear to her. After thinking, thinking, all through those long days she rated accurately Charles Townsend's value; he was a common fellow and his qualities were second-rate. If she could only tear from her heart the love that still lingered there! She tried not to think of him.

Waddington too thought highly of Walter. She alone had been blind to his merit. Why? Because he loved her and she did not love him. What was it in the human heart that made you despise a man because he loved you? But Waddington had confessed that he did not like Walter. Men didn't. It was easy to see that those two nuns had for him a feeling which was very like affection. He was different with women; notwithstanding his shyness you felt in him an exquisite kindliness.





45


But after all it was the nuns that had most deeply touched her. Sister St. Joseph, with her merry face and apple-red cheeks; she had been one of the little band that came out to China with the Mother Superior ten years before and she had seen one after another of her companions die of disease, privation, and homesickness; and yet she remained cheerful and happy. What was it that gave her that naïve and charming humour? And the Mother Superior. Kitty in fancy stood again in her presence and once more she felt humble and ashamed. Though she was so simple and unaffected she had a native dignity which inspired awe, and you could not imagine that any one could treat her without respect. Sister St. Joseph by the way she stood, by every small gesture and the intonation of her answers, had shown the deep submission in which she held herself; and Waddington, frivolous and impertinent, had shown by his tone that he was not quite at his ease. Kitty thought it unnecessary to have told her that the Mother Superior belonged to one of the great families of France; there was that in her bearing which suggested ancient race, and she had the authority of one who has never known that it is possible to be disobeyed. She had the condescension of a great lady and the humility of a saint. There was in her strong, handsome and ravaged face an austerity that was passionate; and at the same time she had a solicitude and a gentleness which permitted those little children to cluster, noisy and unafraid, in the assurance of her deep affection. When she had looked at the four new-born babies she had worn a smile that was sweet and yet profound: it was like a ray of sunshine on a wild and desolate heath. What Sister St. Joseph had said so carelessly of Walter moved Kitty strangely; she knew that he had desperately wanted her to bear a child, but she had never suspected from his reticence that he was capable with a baby of showing without embarrassment a charming and playful tenderness. Most men were silly and awkward with babies. How strange he was!

But to all that moving experience there had been a shadow (a dark lining to the silver cloud), insistent and plain, which disconcerted her. In the sober gaiety of Sister St. Joseph, and much more in the beautiful courtesy of the Mother Superior, she had felt an aloofness which oppressed her. They were friendly and even cordial, but at the same time they held something back, she knew not what, so that she was conscious that she was nothing but a casual stranger. There was a barrier between her and them. They spoke a different language not only of the tongue but of the heart. And when the door was closed upon her she felt that they had put her out of their minds so completely, going about their neglected work again without delay, that for them she might never have existed. She felt shut out not only from that poor little convent, but from some mysterious garden of the spirit after which with all her soul she hankered. She felt on a sudden alone as she had never felt alone before. That was why she had wept.

And now, throwing back her head wearily, she sighed: “Oh, I'm so worthless.”





46


That evening Walter came back to the bungalow a little earlier than usual. Kitty was lying on the long chair by the open window. It was nearly dark.

“Don't you want a lamp?” he asked.

“They'll bring it when dinner is ready.”

He talked to her always quite casually, of trifling things, as though they were friendly acquaintances, and there was never anything in his manner to suggest that he harboured malice in his heart. He never met her eyes and he never smiled. He was scrupulously polite.

“Walter, what do you propose we should do if we get through the epidemic?” she asked.

He waited a moment before answering. She could not see his face.

“I haven't thought.”

In the old days she said carelessly whatever came into her head; it never occurred to her to think before she spoke; but now she was afraid of him; she felt her lips tremble and her heart beat painfully.

“I went to the convent this afternoon.”

“So I heard.”

She forced herself to speak though she could hardly frame the words.

“Did you really want me to die when you brought me here?”

“If I were you I'd leave well alone, Kitty. I don't think any good will come of talking about what we should do much better to forget.”

“But you don't forget; neither do I. I've been thinking a great deal since I came here. Won't you listen to what I have to say?”

“Certainly.”

“I treated you very badly. I was unfaithful to you.”

He stood stock still. His immobility was strangely terrifying.

“I don't know whether you'll understand what I mean. That sort of thing doesn't mean very much to a woman when it's over. I think women have never quite understood the attitude that men take up.”She spoke abruptly, in a voice she would hardly have recognised as her own. “You know what Charlie was and you knew what he'd do. Well, you were quite right. He's a worthless creature. I suppose I shouldn't have been taken in by him if I hadn't been as worthless as he. I don't ask you to forgive me. I don't ask you to love me as you used to love me. But couldn't we be friends? With all these people dying in thousands round us, and with those nuns in their convent . . .”

“What have they got to do with it?” he interrupted.

“I can't quite explain. I had such a singular feeling when I went there to-day. It all seems to mean so much. It's all so terrible and their self-sacrifice is so wonderful; I can't help feeling it's absurd and disproportionate, if you understand what I mean, to distress yourself because a foolish woman has been unfaithful to you. I'm much too worthless and insignificant for you to give me a thought.”

He did not answer, but he did not move away; he seemed to be waiting for her to continue.

“Mr. Waddington and the nuns have told me such wonderful things about you. I'm very proud of you, Walter.”

“You used not to be; you used to feel contempt for me. Don't you still?”

“Don't you know that I'm afraid of you?”

Again he was silent.

“I don't understand you,” he said at last. “I don't know what it is you want.”

“Nothing for myself. I only want you to be a little less unhappy.”

She felt him stiffen and his voice was very cold when he answered.

“You're mistaken in thinking I'm unhappy. I have a great deal too much to do to think of you very often.”

“I have wondered if the nuns would allow me to go and work at the convent. They are very shorthanded and if I could be of any help I should be grateful to them.”

“It is not easy work or pleasant work. I doubt if it would amuse you long.”

“Do you absolutely despise me, Walter?”

“No.” He hesitated and his voice was strange. “I despise myself.”





47


It was after dinner. As usual Walter sat by the lamp and read. He read every evening till Kitty went to bed and then went into a laboratory which he had fitted up in one of the bungalow's empty rooms. Here he worked late into the night. He slept little. He was occupied with she knew not what experiments. He told her nothing of his work; but even in the old days he had been reticent on this: he was not by nature expansive. She thought deeply of what he had just said to her: the conversation had led to nothing. She knew him so little that she could not be sure if he was speaking the truth or not. Was it possible that, whereas he now existed so ominously for her, she had entirely ceased to exist for him? Her conversation, which had entertained him once because he loved her, now that he loved her no longer might be merely tedious to him. It mortified her.

She looked at him. The light of the lamp displayed his profile as though it were a cameo. With his regular and finely cut features it was very distinguished, but it was more than severe, it was grim: that immobility of his, only his eyes moving as he perused each page, was vaguely terrifying. Who would have thought that this hard face could be melted by passion to such a tenderness of expression? She knew and it excited in her a little shiver of distaste. It was strange that though he was good-looking as well as honest, reliable and talented, it had been so impossible for her to love him. It was a relief that she need never again submit to his caresses.

He would not answer when she had asked him whether in forcing her to come here he had really wished to kill her. The mystery of this fascinated and horrified her. He was so extraordinarily kind; it was incredible that he could have had such a devilish intention. He must have suggested it only to frighten her and to get back on Charlie (that would be like his sardonic humour) and then from obstinacy or from fear of looking foolish insisted on her going through with it.

Yes, he said he despised himself. What did he mean by that? Once again Kitty looked at his calm cool face. She might not even be in the room, he was so unconscious of her.

“Why do you despise yourself?” she asked, hardly knowing that she spoke, as though she were continuing without a break the earlier conversation.

He put down his book and observed her reflectively. He seemed to gather his thoughts from a remote distance.

“Because I loved you.”

She flushed and looked away. She could not bear his cold, steady and appraising gaze. She understood what he meant. It was a little while before she answered.

“I think you do me an injustice,” she said. “It's not fair to blame me because I was silly and frivolous and vulgar. I was brought up like that. All the girls I know are like that... It's like reproaching someone who has no ear for music because he's bored at a symphony concert. Is it fair to blame me because you ascribed to me qualities I hadn't got? I never tried to deceive you by pretending I was anything I wasn't. I was just pretty and gay. You don't ask for a pearl necklace or a sable coat at a booth in a fair; you ask for a tin trumpet and a toy balloon.”

“I don't blame you.”

His voice was weary. She was beginning to feel a trifle impatient with him. Why could he not realize, what suddenly had become so clear to her, that beside all the terror of death under whose shadow they lay and beside the awe of the beauty which she had caught a glimpse of that day, their own affairs were trivial? What did it really matter if a silly woman had committed adultery and why should her husband, face to face with the sublime, give it a thought? It was strange that Walter with all his cleverness should have so little sense of proportion. Because he had dressed a doll in gorgeous robes and set her in a sanctuary to worship her, and then discovered that the doll was filled with sawdust he could neither forgive himself nor her. His soul was lacerated. It was all make-believe that he had lived on, and when the truth shattered it he thought reality itself was shattered. It was true enough, he would not forgive her because he could not forgive himself.

She thought that she heard him give a faint sigh and she shot a rapid glance at him. A sudden thought struck her and it took her breath away. She only just refrained from giving a cry.

Was it what they called--a broken heart--that he suffered from?





48


All the next day Kitty thought of the convent; and the morning after, early, soon after Walter had gone, taking the amah with her to get chairs, she crossed the river. It was barely day and the Chinese crowding the ferry boat, some in the blue cotton of the peasant, others in the black robes of respectability, had a strange look of the dead being borne over the water to the land of shadow. And when they stepped ashore they stood for a little at the landing-place uncertainly as though they did not quite know where to go, before desultorily, in twos and threes, they wandered up the hill.

At that hour the streets of the city were very empty so that more than ever it seemed a city of the dead. The passers-by had an abstracted air so that you might almost have thought them ghosts. The sky was unclouded and the early sun shed a heavenly mildness on the scene; it was difficult to imagine, on that blithe, fresh and smiling morn, that the city lay gasping, like a man whose life is being throttled out of him by a maniac's hands, in the dark clutch of the pestilence. It was incredible that nature (the blue of the sky was clear like a child's heart) should be so indifferent when men were writhing in agony and going to their death in fear. When the chairs were set down at the convent door a beggar arose from the ground and asked Kitty for alms. He was clad in faded and shapeless rags that looked as though he had raked them out of a muck-heap, and through their rents you saw his skin hard and rough and tanned like the hide of a goat; his bare legs were emaciated, and his head, with its shock of coarse gray hair (the cheeks hollow, the eyes wild), was the head of a madman. Kitty turned from him in frightened horror, and the chair-bearers in gruff tones bade him begone, but he was importunate, and to be rid of him, shuddering, Kitty gave him a few cash.

The door was opened and the amah explained that Kitty wished to see the Mother Superior. She was taken once more into the stiff parlor in which it seemed a window had never been opened, and here she sat so long that she began to think her message had not been delivered. At last the Mother Superior came in.

“I must ask you to excuse me for keeping you waiting,” she said. “I did not expect you and I was occupied.”

“Forgive me for troubling you. I am afraid I have come at an inconvenient moment.”

The Mother Superior gave her a smile, austere but sweet, and begged her to sit down. But Kitty saw that her eyes were swollen. She had been weeping. Kitty was startled, for she had received from the Mother Superior the impression that she was a woman whom earthly troubles could not greatly move.

“I am afraid something has happened,” she faltered. “Would you like me to go away? I can come another time.”

“No, no. Tell me what I can do for you. It is only--only that one of our Sisters died last night.” Her voice lost its even tone and her eyes filled with tears. “It is wicked of me to grieve, for I know that her good and simple soul has flown straight to heaven; she was a saint; but it is difficult always to control one's weakness. I am afraid I am not always very reasonable.”

“I'm so sorry, I'm so dreadfully sorry,” said Kitty.

Her ready sympathy brought a sob into her voice.

“She was one of the Sisters who came out from France with me ten years ago. There are only three of us left now. I remember, we stood in a little group at the end of the boat (what do you call it, the bow?) and as we steamed out of the harbour at Marseilles and we saw the golden figure of Saint Marie la Grace, we said a prayer together. It had been my greatest wish since I entered religion to be allowed to come to China, but when I saw the land grow distant I could not prevent myself from weeping. I was their Superior; it was not a very good example I was giving my daughters. And then Sister St. Francis Xavier--that is the name of the Sister who died last night--took my hand and told me not to grieve; for wherever we were, she said, there was France and there was God.”

That severe and handsome face was distorted by the grief which human nature wrung from her and by the effort to restrain the tears which her reason and her faith refused. Kitty looked away. She felt that it was indecent to peer into that struggle.

“I have been writing to her father. She, like me, was her mother's only daughter. They were fisher folk in Brittany, and it will be hard for them. Oh, when will this terrible epidemic cease? Two of our girls have been attacked this morning and nothing but a miracle can save them. These Chinese have no resistance. The loss of Sister St. Francis is very severe. There is so much to do and now fewer than ever to do it. We have Sisters at our other houses in China who are eager to come, all our Order, I think, would give anything in the world (only they have nothing) to come here; but it is almost certain death; and so long as we can manage with the Sisters we have I am unwilling that others should be sacrificed.”

“That encourages me, ma mère;” said Kitty.“I have been feeling that I had come at a very unfortunate moment. You said the other day that there was more work than the Sisters could do, and I was wondering if you would allow me to come and help them. I do not mind what I do if I can only be useful. I should be thankful if you just set me to scrub the floors.”

The Mother Superior gave an amused smile and Kitty was astonished at the mobile temperament which could so easily pass from mood to mood.

“There is no need to scrub the floors. That is done after a fashion by the orphans.” She paused and looked kindly at Kitty. “My dear child, do you not think that you have done enough in coming with your husband here? That is more than many wives would have had the courage to do, and for the rest how can you be better occupied than in giving him peace and comfort when he comes home to you after the day's work? Believe me, he needs then all your love and all your consideration.”

Kitty could not easily meet the eyes which rested on her with a detached scrutiny and with an ironical kindliness.

“I have nothing whatever to do from morning till night,” said Kitty. “I feel that there is so much to be done that I cannot bear to think that I am idle. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, and I know that I have no claim either on your kindness or on your time, but I mean what I say and it would be a charity that you were doing me if you would let me be of some help to you.”

“You do not look very strong. When you did us the pleasure of coming to see us the day before yesterday it seemed to me that you were very pale. Sister St. Joseph thought that perhaps you were going to have a baby.”

“No, no,” cried Kitty, flushing to the roots of her hair.

The Mother Superior gave a little, silvery laugh.

“It is nothing to be ashamed of, my dear child, nor is there anything improbable in the supposition. How long have you been married?”

“I am very pale because I am naturally pale, but I am very strong, and I promise you I am not afraid of work.”

Now the Superior was complete mistress of herself. She assumed unconsciously the air of authority which was habitual to her and she held Kitty in an appraising scrutiny. Kitty felt unaccountably nervous.

“Can you speak Chinese?”

“I'm afraid not,” answered Kitty.

“Ah, that is a pity. I could have put you in charge of the elder girls. It is very difficult just now, and I am afraid they will get--what do you call? Out of hand?” she concluded with a tentative sound.

“Could I not be of help to the Sisters in nursing? I am not at all afraid of the cholera. I could nurse the girls or the soldiers.”

The Mother Superior, unsmiling now, a reflective look on her face, shook her head.

“You do not know what the cholera is. It is a dreadful thing to see. The work in the infirmary is done by soldiers and we need a Sister only to supervise. And so far as the girls are concerned . . . no, no, I am sure your husband would not wish it; it is a terrible and frightening sight.”

“I should grow used to it.”

“No, it is out of the question. It is our business and our privilege to do such things, but there is no call for you to do so.”

“You make me feel very useless and very helpless. It seems incredible that there should be nothing that I can do.”

“Have you spoken to your husband of your wish?”

“Yes.”

The Mother Superior looked at her as though she were delving into the secrets of her heart, but when she saw Kitty's anxious and appealing look she gave a smile.

“Of course you are a Protestant?” she asked.

“Yes.”

“It doesn't matter. Dr. Watson, the missionary who died, was a Protestant, and it made no difference. He was all that was most charming to us. We owe him a deep debt of gratitude.”

Now the flicker of a smile passed over Kitty's face, but she did not say anything. The Mother Superior seemed to reflect. She rose to her feet.

“It is very good of you. I think I can find something for you to do. It is true that now Sister St. Francis has been taken from us, it is impossible for us to cope with the work. When will you be ready to start?”

“Now.”

“À la bonne heure. I am content to hear you say that.”

“I promise you I will do my best. I am very grateful to you for the opportunity that you are giving me.”

The Mother Superior opened the parlor door, but as she was going out she hesitated. Once more she gave Kitty a long, searching and sagacious look. Then she laid her hand gently on her arm.

“You know, my dear child, that one cannot find peace in work or in pleasure, in the world or in a convent, but only in one's soul.”

Kitty gave a little start, but the Mother Superior passed swiftly out.





49


Kitty found the work a refreshment to her spirit. She went to the convent every morning soon after sunrise and did not return to the bungalow till the westering sun flooded the narrow river and its crowded junks with gold. The Mother Superior gave into her care the smaller children. Kitty's mother had brought to London from her native Liverpool a practical sense of housewifery and Kitty, notwithstanding her air of frivolity, had always had certain gifts to which she referred only in bantering tones. Thus she could cook quite well and she sewed beautifully. When she disclosed this talent she was set to supervise the stitching and hemming of the younger girls. They knew a little French and every day she picked up a few words of Chinese so that it was not difficult for her to manage. At other times she had to see that the smaller children did not get into mischief; she had to dress and undress them and take care that they rested when rest was needed. There were a good many babies and these were in charge of amahs, but she was bidden to keep an eye on them. None of the work was very important and she would have liked to do something which was more arduous; but the Mother Superior paid no attention to her entreaties and Kitty stood sufficiently in awe of her not to be importunate.

For the first few days she had to make something of an effort to overcome the faint distaste she felt for these little girls, in their ugly uniforms, with their stiff black hair, their round yellow faces, and their staring, sloe-black eyes. But she remembered the soft look which had transfigured so beautifully the countenance of the Mother Superior when on Kitty's first visit to the convent she had stood surrounded by those ugly little things, and she would not allow herself to surrender to her instinct. And presently, taking in her arms one or other of the tiny creatures, crying because of a fall or a cutting tooth, when Kitty found that a few soft words, though in a language the child could not understand, the pressure of her arms and the softness of her cheek against the weeping yellow face, could comfort and console, she began to lose all her feeling of strangeness. The small children, without any fear of her, came to her in their childish troubles and it gave her a peculiar happiness to discern their confidence. It was the same with the older girls, those to whom she taught sewing; their bright, clever smiles, and the pleasure she could give them by a word of praise, touched her. She felt that they liked her and, flattered and proud, she liked them in return.

But there was one child that she could not grow used to. It was a little girl of six, an idiot with a huge hydrocephalic head that swayed top-heavily on a small, squat body, large vacant eyes and a drooling mouth; the creature spoke hoarsely a few mumbled words; it was revolting and horrible; and for some reason it conceived an idiot attachment for Kitty so that it followed her about as she changed her place from one part of the large room to another. It clung to her skirt and rubbed its face against her knees. It sought to fondle her hands. She shivered with disgust. She knew it yearned for caresses and she could not bring herself to touch it.

Once, speaking of it to Sister St. Joseph, she said that it was a pity it lived. Sister St. Joseph smiled and stretched out her hand to the misformed thing. It came and rubbed its bulging forehead against it.

“Poor little mite,” said the nun. “She was brought here positively dying. By the mercy of Providence I was at the door just as she came. I thought there was not a moment to lose so I baptized her at once. You would not believe what trouble we have had to keep her with us. Three or four times we thought that her little soul would escape to heaven.”

Kitty was silent. Sister St. Joseph in her loquacious way began to gossip of other things. And next day when the idiot child came to her and touched her hand Kitty nerved herself to place it in a caress on the great bare skull. She forced her lips into a smile. But suddenly the child, with an idiot perversity, left her; it seemed to lose interest in her, and that day and the following days paid her no attention. Kitty did not know what she had done and tried to lure it to her with smiles and gestures, but it turned away and pretended not to see her.





50


Since the nuns were busy from morning till night with a hundred duties Kitty saw little of them but at the services in the bare, humble chapel. On her first day the Mother Superior, catching sight of her seated at the back behind the girls on the benches according to their ages, stopped and spoke to her.

“You must not think it necessary for you to come to the chapel when we do,” she said. “You are a Protestant and you have your own convictions.”

“But I like to come, Mother. I find that it rests me.”

The Mother Superior gave her a moment's glance and slightly inclined her grave head.

“Of course you will do exactly as you choose. I merely wanted you to understand that you are under no obligation.”

But with Sister St. Joseph Kitty soon became on terms not of intimacy perhaps but of familiarity. The economy of the convent was in her charge and to look after the material well-being of that big family kept the Sister on her feet all day. She said that the only time she had to rest was that which she devoted to prayer. But it pleased her towards evening when Kitty was with the girls at their work to come in and, vowing that she was tired out and had not a moment to spare, sit down for a few minutes and gossip. When she was not in the presence of the Mother Superior she was a talkative, merry creature, fond of a joke, and she did not dislike a bit of scandal. Kitty stood in no fear of her, her habit did not prevent Sister St. Joseph from being a good-natured, homely woman, and she chattered with her gaily. She did not mind with her showing how badly she talked French and they laughed with one another over Kitty's mistakes. The Sister taught her every day a few useful words of Chinese. She was a farmer's daughter and at heart she was still a peasant.

“I used to keep the cows when I was little,” she said, “like St. Joan of Arc. But I was too wicked to have visions. It was fortunate, I think, for my father would certainly have whipped me if I had. He used often to whip me, the good old man, for I was a very naughty little girl. I am ashamed sometimes when I think now of the pranks I used to play.”

Kitty laughed at the thought that this corpulent, middle-aged nun could ever have been a wayward child. And yet there was something childlike in her still so that your heart went out to her: she seemed to have about her an aroma of the countryside in autumn when the apple trees are laden with fruit and the crops are in and safely housed. She had not the tragic and austere saintliness of the Mother Superior, but a gaiety that was simple and happy.

“Do you never wish to go home again, ma soeur?” asked Kitty.

“Oh, no. It would be too hard to come back. I love to be here and I am never so happy as when I am among the orphans. They're so good, they're so grateful. But it is all very well to be a nun(on a beau être religieuse), still one has a mother and one cannot forget that one drank the milk of her breasts. She is old, my mother, and it is hard never to see her again; but then she is fond of her daughter-in-law, and my brother is good to her. His son is growing up now, I should think they will be glad of an extra pair of strong arms on the farm; he was only a child when I left France, but he promised to have a fist that you could fell an ox with.”

It was almost impossible in that quiet room, listening to the nun, to realize that on the other side of these four walls cholera was raging. Sister St. Joseph had an unconcern which conveyed itself to Kitty.

She had a naïve curiosity about the world and its inhabitants. She asked Kitty all kinds of questions about London and England, a country, she thought, where so thick was the fog that you could not see your hand at mid-day, and she wanted to know if Kitty went to balls and whether she lived in a grand house and how many brothers and sisters she had. She spoke often of Walter. The Mother Superior said he was wonderful and every day they prayed for him. How lucky Kitty was to have a husband who was so good and so brave and so clever.

But sooner or later Sister St. Joseph returned to the subject of the Mother Superior. Kitty had been conscious from the beginning that the personality of this woman dominated the convent. She was regarded by all that dwelt there with love certainly and with admiration, but also with awe and not a little dread. Notwithstanding her kindliness Kitty herself felt like a schoolgirl in her presence. She was never quite at her ease with her, for she was filled with a sentiment which was so strange that it embarrassed her: reverence. Sister St. Joseph, with an ingenuous desire to impress, told Kitty how great the family was to which the Mother Superior belonged; she had among her ancestors persons of historic importance and she was un peu cousine with half the kings of Europe: Alphonso of Spain had hunted at her father's, and they had châteaux all over France. It must have been hard to leave so much grandeur. Kitty listened smilingly, but not a little impressed.

“Du Teste, you have only to look at her,” said the Sister,“to see that, comme famille, c'est le dessus du panier.”

“She has the most beautiful hands that I have ever seen,” said Kitty.

“Ah, but if you only knew how she had used them. She is not afraid of work, notre bonne mère.”

When they had come to this city there had been nothing. They had built the convent. The Mother Superior had made the plans and supervised the work. The moment they arrived they began to save the poor little unwanted girls from the baby-tower and the cruel hands of the midwife. At first they had had no beds to sleep in and no glass to keep out the night air (“and there is nothing,” said Sister St. Joseph, “which is more unwholesome”); and often they had no money left, not only to pay the builders, but even to buy their simple fare; they lived like peasants, what was she saying? the peasants in France, tenez, the men who worked for her father, would have thrown to the pigs the food they ate. And then the Mother Superior would collect her daughters round her and they would kneel and pray; and the Blessed Virgin would send money. A thousand francs would arrive by post next day, or a stranger, an Englishman (a Protestant, if you please) or even a Chinaman would knock at the door while they were actually on their knees and bring them a present. Once they were in such straits that they all made a vow to the Blessed Virgin that they would recite a neuvaine in her honor if she succored them, and, would you believe it? that funny Mr. Waddington came to see us next day and saying that we looked as though we all wanted a good plate of roast beef gave us a hundred dollars.

What a comic little man he was, with his bald head and his little shrewd eyes(ses petits yeux malins)and his jokes. Mon Dieu, how he murdered the French language, and yet you could not help laughing at him. He was always in a good humor. All through this terrible epidemic he carried himself as if he were enjoying a holiday. He had a heart quite French and a wit so that you could hardly believe he was English. Except for his accent. But sometimes Sister St. Joseph thought he spoke badly on purpose to make you laugh. Of course his morals were not all one could wish; but still that was his business (with a sigh, a shrug, and a shake of the head) and he was a bachelor and a young man.

“What is wrong with his morals, ma soeur?” asked Kitty smiling.

“Is it possible that you do not know? It is a sin for me to tell you. I have no business to say such things. He lives with a Chinese woman, that is to say, not a Chinese woman, but a Manchu. A princess, it appears, and she loves him to distraction.”

“That sounds quite impossible,” cried Kitty.

“No, no, I promise you, it is everything that is most true. It is very wicked of him. Those things are not done. Did you not hear, when you first came to the convent and he would not eat the madeleines that I had made expressly, that notre bonne mère said his stomach was deranged by Manchu cooking? That was what she meant and you should have seen the head that he made. It is a story altogether curious. It appears that he was stationed at Hankow during the revolution when they were massacring the Manchus and this good little Waddington saved the lives of one of their great families. They are related to the Imperial Family. The girl fell violently in love with him and--well, the rest you can imagine. And then when he left Hankow she ran away and followed him and now she follows him everywhere, and he has had to resign himself to keep her, poor fellow, and I daresay he is very fond of her; they are quite charming sometimes, these Manchu women. But what am I thinking of? I have a thousand things to do and I sit here. I am a bad religious. I am ashamed of myself.”





52


Kitty had a queer feeling that she was growing. The constant occupation distracted her mind and the glimpses she had of other lives and other outlooks awakened her imagination. She began to regain her spirits; she felt better and stronger. It had seemed to her that she could do nothing now but weep; but to her surprise, and not a little to her confusion, she caught herself laughing at this and that. It began to seem quite natural to live in the midst of a terrible epidemic. She knew that people were dying to the right and left of her, but she ceased very much to think of it. The Mother Superior had forbidden her to go into the infirmaries and the closed doors excited her curiosity. She would have liked to peep in, but could not do so without being seen, and she did not know what punishment the Mother Superior would inflict upon her. It would be dreadful to be sent away. She was devoted to the children now and they would miss her if she went; in fact she did not know what they would do without her.

And one day it occurred to her that she had neither thought of Charles Townsend nor dreamt of him for a week. Her heart gave a sudden thud against her ribs: she was cured. She could think of him now with indifference. She loved him no longer. Oh, the relief and the sense of liberation! It was strange to look back and remember how passionately she had yearned for him; she thought she would die when he failed her; she thought life thenceforward had nothing to offer but misery. And now already she was laughing. A worthless creature. What a fool she had made of herself! And now, considering him calmly, she wondered what on earth she had seen in him. It was lucky that Waddington knew nothing, she could never have endured his malicious eyeing and his ironical innuendoes. She was free, free at last, free! She could hardly prevent herself from laughing aloud.

The children were playing some romping game and it was her habit to look on with an indulgent smile, restraining them when they made too much noise and taking care that in their boisterousness none was hurt; but now in her high spirits, feeling as young as any of them, she joined in the game. The little girls received her with delight. They chased up and down the room, shouting at the top of their shrill voices, with fantastic and almost barbarous glee. They grew so excited that they leaped into the air with joy. The noise was terrific.

Suddenly the door opened and the Mother Superior stood on the threshold. Kitty, abashed, extricated herself from the clutches of a dozen little girls who with wild shrieks had seized her.

“Is this how you keep these children good and quiet?” asked the Mother Superior, a smile on her lips.

“We were having a game, Mother. They got excited. It is my fault, I led them on.”

The Mother Superior came forward and as usual the children clustered about her. She put her hands round their narrow shoulders and playfully pulled their little yellow ears. She looked at Kitty with a long, soft look. Kitty was flushed and she was breathing quickly. Her liquid eyes were shining and her lovely hair, disarranged in all the struggling and the laughter, was in adorable confusion.

“Que vous êtes belle, ma chère enfant,” said the Mother Superior. “It does the heart good to look at you. No wonder these children adore you.”

Kitty blushed deeply and, she knew not why, tears suddenly filled her eyes. She covered her face with her hands.

“Oh, Mother, you make me ashamed.”

“Come, do not be silly. Beauty is also a gift of God, one of the most rare and precious, and we should be thankful if we are happy enough to possess it and thankful, if we are not, that others possess it for our pleasure.”

She smiled again and as though Kitty were a child too gently patted her soft cheek.





53


Since she had been working at the convent Kitty had seen less of Waddington. Two or three times he had come down to the river bank to meet her and they had walked up the hill together. He came in to drink a whisky and soda, but he would seldom stay to dinner. One Sunday, however, he suggested that they should take their luncheon with them and go in chairs to a Buddhist monastery. It was situated ten miles from the city and had some reputation as a place of pilgrimage. The Mother Superior, insisting that Kitty must have a day's rest, would not let her work on Sundays and Walter of course was as busy then as usual.

They started early in order to arrive before the heat of the day and were carried along a narrow causeway between the rice-fields. Now and then they passed comfortable farm-houses nestling with friendly intimacy in a grove of bamboos. Kitty enjoyed the idleness; it was pleasant after being cooped up in the city to see about her the wide country. They came to the monastery, straggling low buildings by the side of the river, agreeably shaded by trees, and were led by smiling monks throughout courtyards, empty with a solemn emptiness, and shown temples with grimacing gods. In the sanctuary sat the Buddha, remote and sad, wistful, abstracted and faintly smiling. There was about everything a sense of dejection; the magnificence was shoddy and ruined; the gods were dusty and the faith that had made them was dying. The monks seemed to stay on sufferance, as though they awaited a notice to quit; and in the smile of the abbot, with his beautiful politeness, was the irony of resignation. One of these days the monks would wander away from the shady, pleasant wood, and the buildings, crumbling and neglected, would be battered by fierce storms and besieged by the surrounding nature. Wild creepers would twine themselves about the dead images and the trees would grow in the courtyards. Then the gods would dwell there no longer, but evil spirits of darkness.





54


They sat on the steps of a little building (four lacquered columns and a high, tiled roof under which stood a great bronze bell) and watched the river flow sluggish and with many a bend towards the stricken city. They could see its crenellated walls. The heat hung over it like a pall. But the river, though it flowed so slowly, had still a sense of movement and it gave one a melancholy feeling of the transitoriness of things. Everything passed, and what trace of its passage remained? It seemed to Kitty that they were all, the human race, like the drops of water in that river and they flowed on, each so close to the other and yet so far apart, a nameless flood, to the sea. When all things lasted so short a time and nothing mattered very much, it seemed pitiful that men, attaching an absurd importance to trivial objects, should make themselves and one another so unhappy.

“Do you know Harrington Gardens?” she asked Waddington, with a smile in her beautiful eyes.

“No. Why?”

“Nothing; only it's a long way from here. It's where my people live.”

“Are you thinking of going home?”

“No.”

“I suppose you'll be leaving here in a couple of months. The epidemic seems to be abating and the cool weather should see the end of it.”

“I almost think I shall be sorry to go.”

For a moment she thought of the future. She did not know what plans Walter had in mind. He told her nothing. He was cool, polite, silent, and inscrutable. Two little drops in that river that flowed silently towards the unknown; two little drops that to themselves had so much individuality and to the onlooker were but an undistinguishable part of the water.

“Take care the nuns don't start converting you,” said Waddington, with his malicious little smile.

“They're much too busy. Nor do they care. They're wonderful and so kind; and yet--I hardly know how to explain it--there is a wall between them and me. I don't know what it is. It is as though they possessed a secret which made all the difference in their lives and which I was unworthy to share. It is not faith; it is something deeper and more--more significant: they walk in a different world from ours and we shall always be strangers to them. Each day when the convent door closes behind me I feel that for them I have ceased to exist.”

“I can understand that it is something of a blow to your vanity,” he returned mockingly.

“My vanity.”

Kitty shrugged her shoulders. Then, smiling once more, she turned to him lazily.

“Why did you never tell me that you lived with a Manchu princess?”

“What have those gossiping old women been telling you? I am sure that it is a sin for nuns to discuss the private affairs of the Customs officials.”

“Why should you be so sensitive?”

Waddington glanced down, sideways, so that it gave him an air of slyness. He faintly shrugged his shoulders.

“It's not a thing to advertise. I do not know that it would greatly add to my chances of promotion in the service.”

“Are you very fond of her?”

He looked up now and his ugly little face had the look of a naughty schoolboy's.

“She's abandoned everything for my sake, home, family, security, and self-respect. It's a good many years now since she threw everything to the winds to be with me. I've sent her away two or three times, but she's always come back; I've run away from her myself, but she's always followed me. And now I've given it up as a bad job; I think I've got to put up with her for the rest of my life.”

“She must really love you to distraction.”

“It's a rather funny sensation, you know,” he answered, wrinkling a perplexed forehead. “I haven't the smallest doubt that if I really left her, definitely, she would commit suicide. Not with any ill-feeling towards me, but quite naturally, because she was unwilling to live without me. It is a curious feeling it gives one to know that. It can't help meaning something to you.”

“But it's loving that's the important thing, not being loved. One's not even grateful to the people who love one; if one doesn't love them, they only bore one.”

“I have no experience of the plural,” he replied. “Mine is only in the singular.”

“Is she really an Imperial Princess?”

“No, that is a romantic exaggeration of the nuns. She belongs to one of the great families of the Manchus, but they have, of course, been ruined by the revolution. She is all the same a very great lady.”

He said it in a tone of pride, so that a smile flickered in Kitty's eyes.

“Are you going to stay here for the rest of your life then?”

“In China? Yes. What would she do elsewhere? When I retire I shall take a little Chinese house in Peking and spend the rest of my days there.”

“Have you any children?”

“No.”

She looked at him curiously. It was strange that this little bald-headed man with his monkey face should have aroused in the alien woman so devastating a passion. She could not tell why the way he spoke of her, notwithstanding his casual manner and his flippant phrases, gave her the impression so strongly of the woman's intense and unique devotion. It troubled her a little.

“It does seem a long way to Harrington Gardens,” she smiled.

“Why do you say that?”

“I don't understand anything. Life is so strange. I feel like some one who's lived all his life by a duck-pond and suddenly is shown the sea. It makes me a little breathless, and yet it fills me with elation. I don't want to die, I want to live. I'm beginning to feel a new courage. I feel like one of those old sailors who set sail for undiscovered seas and I think my soul hankers for the unknown.”

Waddington looked at her reflectively. Her abstracted gaze rested on the smoothness of the river. Two little drops that flowed silently, silently towards the dark, eternal sea.

“May I come and see the Manchu lady?” asked Kitty, suddenly raising her head.

“She can't speak a word of English.”

“You've been very kind to me, you've done a great deal for me, perhaps I could show her by my manner that I had a friendly feeling towards her.”

Waddington gave a thin, mocking little smile, but he answered with good-humour.

“I will come and fetch you one day and she shall give you a cup of jasmine tea.”

She would not tell him that this story of an alien love had from the first moment strangely intrigued her fancy, and the Manchu Princess stood now as the symbol of something that vaguely, but insistently, beckoned to her. She pointed enigmatically to a mystic land of the spirit.





55


But a day or two later Kitty made an unforeseen discovery.

She went to the convent as usual and set about her first work of seeing that the children were washed and dressed. Since the nuns held firmly that the night air was harmful, the atmosphere in the dormitory was close and fetid. After the freshness of the morning it always made Kitty a little uncomfortable and she hastened to open such windows as would. But to-day she felt all of a sudden desperately sick and with her head swimming she stood at the window trying to compose herself. It had never been as bad as this before. Then nausea overwhelmed her and she vomited. She gave a cry so that the children were frightened, and the older girl who was helping her ran up and, seeing Kitty white and trembling, stopped short with an exclamation. Cholera! The thought flashed through Kitty's mind and then a deathlike feeling came over her; she was seized with terror, she struggled for a moment against the night that seemed agonisingly to run through her veins; she felt horribly ill; and then darkness.

When she opened her eyes she did not at first know where she was. She seemed to be lying on the floor and, moving her head slightly, she thought that there was a pillow under it. She could not remember. The Mother Superior was kneeling by her side, holding smelling salts to her nose, and Sister St. Joseph was looking at her. Then it came back. Cholera! She saw the consternation on the nuns' faces. Sister St. Joseph looked huge and her outline was blurred. Once more terror overwhelmed her.

“Oh, Mother, Mother,” she sobbed. “Am I going to die? I don't want to die.”

“Of course you're not going to die,” said the Mother Superior.

She was quite composed and there was even amusement in her eyes.

“But it's cholera. Where's Walter? Has he been sent for? Oh, Mother, Mother.”

She burst into a flood of tears. The Mother Superior gave her hand and Kitty seized it as though it were a hold upon the life she feared to lose.

“Come, come, my dear child, you mustn't be so silly. It's not cholera or anything of the kind.”

“Where's Walter?”

“Your husband is much too busy to be troubled. In five minutes you'll be perfectly well.”

Kitty looked at her with staring, harassed eyes. Why did she take it so calmly? It was cruel.

“Keep perfectly quiet for a minute,” said the Mother Superior.“There is nothing to alarm yourself about.”

Kitty felt her heart beat madly. She had grown so used to the thought of cholera that it had ceased to seem possible that she could catch it. Oh, the fool she had been! She knew she was going to die. She was frightened. The girls brought in a long rattan chair and placed it by the window.

“Come, let us lift you,” said the Mother Superior. “You will be more comfortable on the chaise longue. Do you think you can stand?”

She put her hands under Kitty's arms and Sister St. Joseph helped her to her feet. She sank exhausted into the chair.

“I had better shut the window,” said Sister St. Joseph. “The early morning air cannot be good for her.”

“No, no,” said Kitty. “Please leave it open.”

It gave her confidence to see the blue sky. She was shaken, but certainly she began to feel better. The two nuns looked at her for a moment in silence, and Sister St. Joseph said something to the Mother Superior which she could not understand. Then the Mother Superior sat on the side of the chair and took her hand.

“Listen, ma chère enfant…”

She asked her one or two questions. Kitty answered them without knowing what they meant. Her lips were trembling so that she could hardly frame the words.

“There is no doubt about it,” said Sister St. Joseph. “I am not one to be deceived in such a matter.”

She gave a little laugh in which Kitty seemed to discern a certain excitement and not a little affection. The Mother Superior, still holding Kitty's hand, smiled with soft tenderness.

“Sister St. Joseph has more experience of these things than I have, dear child, and she said at once what was the matter with you. She was evidently quite right.”

“What do you mean?” asked Kitty anxiously.

“It is quite evident. Did the possibility of such a thing never occur to you? You are with child, my dear.”

The start that Kitty gave shook her from head to foot, and she put her feet to the ground as though to spring up.

“Lie still, lie still,” said the Mother Superior.

Kitty felt herself blush furiously and she put her hands to her breasts.

“It's impossible. It isn't true.”

“Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit?” asked Sister St. Joseph.

The Mother Superior translated. Sister St. Joseph's broad simple face, with its red cheeks, was beaming.

“No mistakes is possible. I give you my word of honor.”

“How long have you been married, my child?” asked the Mother Superior. “Why, when my sister-in-law had been married as long as you she had already two babies.”

Kitty sank back into the chair. There was death in her heart.

“I'm so ashamed,” she whispered.

“Because you are going to have a baby? Why, what can be more natural?”

“Quelle joie pour le docteur,” said Sister St. Joseph.

“Yes, think what a happiness for your husband. He will be overwhelmed with joy. You have only to see him with babies, and the look on his face when he plays with them, to see how enchanted he will be to have one of his own.”

For a little while Kitty was silent. The two nuns looked at her with tender interest and the Mother Superior stroked her hand.

“It was silly of me not to have suspected it before,” said Kitty.“At all events I'm glad it's not cholera. I feel very much better. I will get back to my work.”

“Not to-day, my dear child. You have had a shock, you had much better go home and rest yourself.”

“No, no, I would much rather stay and work.”

“I insist. What would our good doctor say if I let you be imprudent? Come to-morrow, if you like, or the day after, but to-day you must be quiet. I will send for a chair. Would you like me to let one of our young girls go with you?”

“Oh, no, I shall be all right alone.”





56


Kitty was lying on her bed and the shutters were closed. It was after luncheon and the servants slept. What she had learnt that morning (and now she was certain that it was true) filled her with consternation. Ever since she came home she had been trying to think; but her mind was a blank, and she could not collect her thoughts. Suddenly she heard a step, the feet were booted so that it could not be one of the boys; with a gasp of apprehension she realised that it could only be her husband. He was in the sitting-room and she heard herself called. She did not reply. There was a moment's silence and then a knock on her door.

“Yes?”

“May I come in?”

Kitty rose from her bed and slipped into a dressing-gown.

“Yes.”

He entered. She was glad that the closed shutters shadowed her face.

“I hope I didn't wake you. I knocked very, very gently.”

“I haven't been asleep.”

He went to one of the windows and threw open the shutter. A flood of warm light streamed into the room.

“What is it?” she asked. “Why are you back so early?”

“The Sisters said that you weren't very well. I thought I had better come and see what was the matter.”

A flash of anger passed through her.

“What would you have said if it had been cholera?”

“If it had been you certainly couldn't have made your way home this morning.”

She went to the dressing-table and passed the comb through her shingled hair. She wanted to gain time. Then, sitting down, she lit a cigarette.

“I wasn't very well this morning and the Mother Superior thought I'd better come back here. But I'm perfectly all right again. I shall go to the convent as usual to-morrow.”

“What was the matter with you?”

“Didn't they tell you?”

“No. The Mother Superior said that you must tell me yourself.”

He did now what he did seldom; he looked her full in the face; his professional instincts were stronger than his personal. She hesitated. Then she forced herself to meet his eyes.

“I'm going to have a baby,” she said.

She was accustomed to his habit of meeting with silence a statement which you would naturally expect to evoke an exclamation, but never had it seemed to her more devastating. He said nothing; he made no gesture; no movement on his face nor change of expression in his dark eyes indicated that he had heard. She felt suddenly inclined to cry. If a man loved his wife and his wife loved him, at such a moment they were drawn together by a poignant emotion. The silence was intolerable and she broke it.

“I don't know why it never occurred to me before. It was stupid of me, but… what with one thing and another… ”

“How long have you… when do you expect to be confined?”

The words seemed to issue from his lips with difficulty. She felt that his throat was as dry as hers. It was a nuisance that her lips trembled so when she spoke; if he was not of stone it must excite his pity.

“I suppose I've been like this between two and three months.”

“Am I the father?”

She gave a little gasp. There was just a shadow of a tremor in his voice; it was dreadful that cold self-control of his which made the smallest token of emotion so shattering. She did not know why she thought suddenly of an instrument she had been shown in Hong Kong upon which a needle oscillated a little and she had been told that this represented an earthquake a thousand miles away in which perhaps a thousand persons had lost their lives. She looked at him. He was ghastly pale. She had seen that pallor on him once, twice before. He was looking down, a little sideways.

“Well?”

She clasped her hands. She knew that if she could say yes it would mean everything in the world to him. He would believe her, of course he would believe her, because he wanted to; and then he would forgive. She knew how deep was his tenderness and how ready he was, for all his shyness, to expend it. She knew that he was not vindictive; he would forgive her if she could but give him an excuse to, an excuse that touched his heart, and he would forgive completely. She could count on him never to throw the past in her teeth. Cruel he might be, cold and morbid, but he was neither mean nor petty. It would alter everything if she said yes.

And she had an urgent need for sympathy. The unexpected knowledge that she was with child had overwhelmed her with strange hopes and unforeseen desires. She felt weak, frightened a little, alone and very far from any friends. That morning, though she cared little for her mother, she had had a sudden craving to be with her. She needed help and consolation. She did not love Walter, she knew that she never could, but at this moment she longed with all her heart for him to take her in his arms so that she could lay her head on his breast; clinging to him she could have cried happily; she wanted him to kiss her and she wanted to twine her arms around his neck.

She began to weep. She had lied so much and she could lie so easily. What could a lie matter when it could only do good? A lie, a lie, what was a lie? It was so easy to say yes. She saw Walter's eyes melt and his arms outstretched towards her. She couldn't say it; she didn't know why, she just couldn't. All she had gone through during these bitter weeks, Charlie and his unkindness, the cholera and all these people dying, the nuns, oddly enough even that funny, drunken little Waddington, it all seemed to have changed her so that she did not know herself; though she was so deeply moved, some bystander in her soul seemed to watch her with terror and surprise. She had to tell the truth. It did not seem worth while to lie. Her thoughts wandered strangely: on a sudden she saw that dead beggar at the foot of the compound wall. Why should she think of him? She did not sob; the tears streamed down her face, quite easily, from wide eyes. At last she answered the question. He had asked her if he was the child's father.

“I don't know,” she said.

He gave the ghost of a chuckle. It made Kitty shudder.

“It's a bit awkward, isn't it?”

His answer was characteristic, it was exactly what she would have expected him to say, but it made her heart sink. She wondered if he realised how hard it had been for her to tell the truth (at the same moment she recognised that it had not been in the least hard, but inevitable)and if he gave her credit for it. Her answer, I don't know, I don't know, hammered away in her head. It was impossible now to take it back. She got her handkerchief from her bag and dried her eyes. They did not speak. There was a siphon on the table by her bed and he got her a glass of water. He brought it to her and held the glass while she drank. She noticed how thin his hand was, it was a fine hand, slender, with long fingers, but now it was nothing but skin and bone; it trembled a little: he could control his face, but his hand betrayed him.

“Don't mind my crying,” she said. “It's nothing really; it's only that I can't help the water running out of my eyes.”

She drank the water and he put the glass back. He sat down on a chair and lit a cigarette. He gave a little sigh. Once or twice before she had heard him sigh like that and it always gave her a catch at the heart. Looking at him now, for he was staring with abstracted gaze out of the window, she was surprised that she had not noticed before how terribly thin he had grown during the last weeks. His temples were sunken and the bones of his face showed through the skin. His clothes hung on him loosely as though they had been made for a larger man. Through his sunburn his face had a greenish pallor. He looked exhausted. He was working too hard, sleeping little and eating nothing. In her own grief and perturbation she found room to pity him. It was cruel to think that she could do nothing for him.

He put his hand over his forehead, as though his head were aching, and she had a feeling that in his brain too those words hammered madly: I don't know, I don't know. It was strange that this moody, cold and shy man should have such a natural affection for very little babies; most men didn't care much even for their own, but the nuns, touched and a little amused, had more than once spoken of it. If he felt like that about those funny little Chinese babies what would he have felt about his own? Kitty bit her lips in order to prevent herself from crying again.

He looked at his watch.

“I'm afraid I must go back to the city. I have a great deal to do to-day… Shall you be all right?”

“Oh, yes. Don't bother about me.”

“I think you'd better not wait for me this evening. I may be very late and I'll get something to eat from Colonel Yü.”

“Very well.”

He rose.

“If I were you, I wouldn't try to do anything to-day. You'd better take it easy. Is there anything you want before I go?”

“No, thanks. I shall be quite all right.”

He paused for an instant, as though he were undecided, and then, abruptly and without looking at her, took his hat and walked out of the room. She heard him go through the compound. She felt terribly alone. There was no need for self-restraint now and she gave herself up to a passion of tears.

The night was sultry and Kitty sat at the window looking at the fantastic roofs, dark against the starlight, of the Chinese temple, when at last Walter came in. Her eyes were heavy with weeping, but she was composed. Notwithstanding all there was to harass her she felt, perhaps only from exhaustion, strangely at peace.

“I thought you'd be already in bed,” said Walter as he came in.

“I wasn't sleepy. I thought it cooler to sit up. Have you had any dinner?”

“All I want.”

He walked up and down the long room and she saw that he had something to say to her. She knew that he was embarrassed. Without concern she waited for him to summon up his resolution. He began abruptly.

“I've been thinking about what you told me this afternoon. It seems to me that it would be better if you went away. I have spoken to Colonel Yü and he will give you an escort. You could take the amah with you. You will be quite safe.”

“Where is there for me to go?”

“You can go to your mother's.”

“Do you think she would be pleased to see me?”

He paused for a moment, hesitating, as though for reflection.

“Then you can go to Hong Kong.”

“What should I do there?”

“You will need a good deal of care and attention. I don't think it's fair to ask you to stay here.”

She could not prevent the smile, not only of bitterness but of frank amusement, that crossed her face. She gave him a glance and very nearly laughed.

“I don't know why you should be so anxious about my health.”

He came over to the window and stood looking out at the night. There had never been so many stars in the unclouded sky.

“This isn't the place for a woman in your condition.”

She looked at him, white in his thin clothes against the darkness; there was something sinister in his fine profile, and yet oddly enough at this moment it excited in her no fear.

“When you insisted on my coming here did you want it to kill me?” she asked suddenly.

He was so long answering that she thought he had refused to hear.

“At first.”

She gave a little shudder, for it was the first time he had admitted his intention. But she bore him no ill will for it. Her feeling surprised herself; there was a certain admiration in it and a faint amusement. She did not quite know why, but suddenly thinking of Charlie Townsend he seemed to her an abject fool.

“It was a terrible risk you were taking,” she answered. “With your sensitive conscience I wonder if you could ever have forgiven yourself if I had died.”

“Well, you haven't. You've thrived on it.”

“I've never felt better in my life.”

She had an instinct to throw herself on the mercy of his humor. After all they had gone through, when they were living amid these scenes of horror and desolation, it seemed inept to attach importance to the ridiculous act of fornication. When death stood round the corner, taking lives like a gardener digging up potatoes, it was foolishness to care what dirty things this person or that did with his body. If she could only make him realize how little Charlie meant to her, so that now already she had difficulty in calling up his features to her imagination, and how entirely the love of him had passed out of her heart! Because she had no feeling for Townsend the various acts she had committed with him had lost their significance. She had regained her heart and what she had given of her body seemed not to matter a rap. She was inclined to say to Walter: “Look here, don't you think we've been silly long enough? We've sulked with one another like children. Why can't we kiss and be friends? There's no reason why we shouldn't be friends just because we're not lovers.”

He stood very still and the lamplight made the pallor of his impassive face startling. She did not trust him; if she said the wrong thing he would turn upon her with such an icy sternness. She knew by now his extreme sensitiveness, for which his acid irony was a protection, and how quickly he could close his heart if his feelings were hurt. She had a moment's irritation at his stupidity. Surely what troubled him most was the wound to his vanity: she vaguely realized that this is the hardest of all wounds to heal. It was singular that men attached so much importance to their wives' faithfulness; when first she had gone with Charlie she had expected to feel quite different, a changed woman; but she had seemed to herself exactly the same, she had experienced only well-being and a greater vitality. She wished now that she had been able to tell Walter that the child was his; the lie would have meant so little to her, and the assurance would have been so great a comfort to him. And after all it might not be a lie: it was funny, that something in her heart which had prevented her from giving herself the benefit of the doubt. How silly men were! Their part in procreation was so unimportant; it was the woman who carried the child through long months of uneasiness and bore it with pain, and yet a man because of his momentary connection made such preposterous claims. Why should that make any difference to him in his feelings towards the child? Then Kitty's thoughts wandered to the child which she herself would bear; she thought of it not with emotion nor with a passion of maternity, but with an idle curiosity.

“I dare say you'd like to think it over a little,” said Walter, breaking the long silence.

“Think what?”

He turned a little as if he were surprised.

“About when you want to go?”

“But I don't want to go.”

“Why not?”

“I like my work at the convent. I think I'm making myself useful. I should prefer to stay as long as you do.”

“I think I should tell you that in your present condition you are probably more liable to catch any infection that happens to be about.”

“I like the discreet way you put it,” she smiled ironically.

“You're not staying for my sake?”

She hesitated. He little knew that now the strongest emotion he excited in her, and the most unexpected, was pity.

“No. You don't love me. I often think I rather bore you.”

“I shouldn't have thought you were the sort of person to put yourself out for a few stuffy nuns and a parcel of Chinese brats.”

Her lips outlined a smile.

“I think it's rather unfair to despise me so much because you made such a mistake in your judgment of me. It's not my fault that you were such an ass.”

“If you're determined to stay you are of course at liberty to do so.”

“I'm sorry I can't give you the opportunity of being magnanimous.” She found it strangely hard to be quite serious with him. “As a matter of fact you're quite right, it's not only for the orphans that I'm staying: you see, I'm in the peculiar position that I haven't got a soul in the world that I can go to. I know no one who wouldn't think me a nuisance. I know no one who cares a row of pins if I'm dead or alive.”

He frowned. But he did not frown in anger.

“We have made a dreadful hash of things, haven't we?” he said.

“Do you still want to divorce me? I don't think I care any more.”

“You must know that by bringing you here I've condoned the offence.”

“I didn't know. You see, I haven't made a study of infidelity. What are we going to do then when we leave here? Are we going on living together?”

“Oh, don't you think we can let the future take care of itself?”

There was the weariness of death in his voice.





58


Two or three days later Waddington fetched Kitty from the convent (for her restlessness had induced her immediately to resume her work) and took her to drink the promised cup of tea with his mistress. Kitty had on more than one occasion dined at Waddington's house. It was a square, white, and pretentious building, such as the Customs build for their officials all over China; and the dining-room in which they ate, the drawing-room in which they sat, were furnished with prim and solid furniture. They had the appearance of being partly offices and partly hotel; there was nothing homelike in them and you understood that these houses were merely places of haphazard sojourn to their successive occupants. It would never have occurred to you that on an upper floor mystery and perhaps romance dwelt shrouded. They ascended a flight of stairs and Waddington opened a door. Kitty went into a large, bare room with whitewashed walls on which hung scrolls in various calligraphies. At a square table, on a stiff arm-chair, both of blackwood and heavily carved, sat the Manchu. She rose as Kitty and Waddington entered, but made no step forward.

“Here she is,” said Waddington, and added something in Chinese.

Kitty shook hands with her. She was slim in her long embroidered gown and somewhat taller than Kitty, used to the Southern people, had expected. She wore a jacket of pale green silk with tight sleeves that came over her wrists and on her black hair, elaborately dressed, was the head-dress of the Manchu women. Her face was coated with powder and her cheeks from the eyes to the mouth heavily rouged; her plucked eyebrows were a thin dark line and her mouth was scarlet. From this mask her black, slightly slanting, large eyes burned like lakes of liquid jet. She seemed more like an idol than a woman. Her movements were slow and assured. Kitty had the impression that she was slightly shy but very curious. She nodded her head two or three times, looking at Kitty, while Waddington spoke of her. Kitty noticed her hands; they were preternaturally long, very slender, of the color of ivory; and the exquisite nails were painted. Kitty thought she had never seen anything so lovely as those languid and elegant hands. They suggested the breeding of uncounted centuries.

She spoke a little, in a high voice, like the twittering of birds in an orchard, and Waddington, translating, told Kitty that she was glad to see her; how old was she and how many children had she got? They sat down on three straight chairs at the square table and a boy brought in bowls of tea, pale and scented with jasmine. The Manchu lady handed Kitty a green tin of Three Castles cigarettes. Beside the table and the chairs the room contained little furniture; there was a wide pallet bed on which was an embroidered head rest and two sandalwood chests.

“What does she do with herself all day long?” asked Kitty.

“She paints a little and sometimes she writes a poem. But she mostly sits. She smokes, but only in moderation, which is fortunate, since one of my duties is to prevent the traffic in opium.”

“Do you smoke?” asked Kitty.

“Seldom. To tell you the truth I much prefer whiskey.”

There was in the room a faintly acrid smell; it was not unpleasant, but peculiar and exotic.

“Tell her that I am sorry I cannot talk to her. I am sure we have many things to say to one another.”

When this was translated to the Manchu she gave Kitty a quick glance in which there was the hint of a smile. She was impressive as she sat, without embarrassment, in her beautiful clothes; and from the painted face the eyes looked out wary, self-possessed and unfathomable. She was unreal, like a picture, and yet had an elegance which made Kitty feel all thumbs. Kitty had never paid anything but passing and somewhat contemptuous attention to the China in which fate had thrown her. It was not done in her set. Now she seemed on a sudden to have an inkling of something remote and mysterious. Here was the East, immemorial, dark and inscrutable. The beliefs and the ideals of the West seemed crude beside ideals and beliefs of which in this exquisite creature she seemed to catch a fugitive glimpse. Here was a different life, lived on a different plane. Kitty felt strangely that the sight of this idol, with her painted face and slanting, wary eyes, made the efforts and the pains of the everyday world she knew slightly absurd. That colored mask seemed to hide the secret of an abundant, profound and significant experience: those long, delicate hands with their tapering fingers held the key of riddles undivined.

“What does she think about all day long?” asked Kitty.

“Nothing,” smiled Waddington.

“She's wonderful. Tell her I've never seen such beautiful hands. I wonder what she sees in you.”

Waddington, smiling, translated the question.

“She says I'm good.”

“As if a woman ever loved a man for his virtue,” Kitty mocked.

The Manchu laughed but once. This was when Kitty, for something to say, expressed admiration of a jade bracelet she wore. She took it off and Kitty, trying to put it on, found, though her hands were small enough, that it would not pass over her knuckles. Then the Manchu burst into childlike laughter. She said something to Waddington and called for an amah. She gave her an instruction and the amah in a moment brought in a pair of very beautiful Manchu shoes.

“She wants to give you these if you can wear them,” said Waddington. “You'll find they make quite good bedroom slippers.”

“They fit me perfectly,” said Kitty, not without satisfaction.

But she noticed a roguish smile on Waddington's face.

“Are they too big for her?” she asked quickly.

“Miles.”

Kitty laughed and when Waddington translated, the Manchu and the amah laughed also.

When Kitty and Waddington, a little later, were walking up the hill together, she turned to him with a friendly smile.

“You did not tell me that you had a great affection for her.”

“What makes you think I have?”

“I saw it in your eyes. It's strange, it must be like loving a phantom or a dream. Men are incalculable; I thought you were like everybody else and now I feel that I don't know the first thing about you.”

As they reached the bungalow he asked her abruptly:

“Why did you want to see her?”

Kitty hesitated for a moment before answering.

“I'm looking for something and I don't quite know what it is. But I know that it's very important for me to know it, and if I did it would make all the difference. Perhaps the nuns know it; when I'm with them I feel that they hold a secret which they will not share with me. I don't know why it came into my head that if I saw this Manchu woman I should have an inkling of what I am looking for. Perhaps she would tell me if she could.”

“What makes you think she knows it?”

Kitty gave him a sidelong glance, but did not answer. Instead she asked him a question.

“Do you know it?”

He smiled and shrugged his shoulders.

“Tao. Some of us look for the Way in opium and some in God, some of us in whiskey and some in love. It is all the same Way and it leads nowhither.”





59


Kitty fell again into the comfortable routine of her work and though in the early morning feeling far from well she had spirit enough not to let it discompose her. She was astonished at the interest the nuns took in her: sisters who, when she saw them in a corridor, had done no more than bid her good morning now on a flimsy pretext came into the room in which she was occupied and looked at her, chatting a little, with a sweet and childlike excitement. Sister St. Joseph told her with a repetition which was sometimes tedious how she had been saying to herself for days past: “Now, I wonder,” or: “I shouldn't be surprised;” and then, when Kitty fainted: “There can be no doubt, it jumps to the eyes.” She told Kitty long stories of her sister-in-law's confinements, which but for Kitty's quick sense of humor would have been not a little alarming. Sister St. Joseph combined in a pleasant fashion the realistic outlook of her upbringing (a river wound through the meadows of her father's farm and the poplars that stood on its bank trembled in the faintest breeze) with a charming intimacy with religious things. One day, firmly convinced that a heretic could know nothing of such matters, she told Kitty of the Annunciation.

“I can never read those lines in the Holy Writ without weeping,” she said. “I do not know why, but it gives me such a funny feeling.”

And then in French, in words that to Kitty sounded unfamiliar and in their precision a trifle cold, she quoted:

“And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.”

The mystery of birth blew through the convent like a little fitful wind playing among the white blossoms of an orchard. The thought that Kitty was with child disturbed and excited those sterile women. She frightened them a little now and fascinated them. They looked upon the physical side of her condition with robust common sense, for they were the daughters of peasants and fishermen; but in their childlike hearts was awe. They were troubled by the thought of her burden and yet happy and strangely exalted. Sister St. Joseph told her that they all prayed for her, and Sister St. Martin had said what a pity it was she was not a Catholic; but the Mother Superior had reproved her; she said that it was possible to be a good woman--une brave femme, she put it--even though one was Protestant and le Bon Dieu would in some way or other arraneg all that.

Kitty was both touched and diverted by the interest she aroused, but surprised beyond measure when she found that even the Mother Superior, so austere in her saintliness, treated her with a new complaisance. She had always been kind to Kitty, but in a remote fashion; now she used her with a tenderness in which there was something maternal. Her voice had in it a new and gentle note and in her eyes was a sudden playfulness as though Kitty were a child who had done a clever and amusing thing. It was oddly moving. Her soul was like a calm, grey sea rolling majestically, awe-inspiring in its sombre greatness, and then suddenly a ray of sunshine made it alert, friendly, and gay. Often now in the evening she would come and sit with Kitty.

“I must take care that you do not tire yourself, mon enfant,” she said, making a transparent excuse to herself, “or Dr. Fane will never forgive me. Oh, this British self-control! There he is delighted beyond measure and when you speak to him of it he becomes quite pale.”

She took Kitty's hand and patted it affectionately.

“Dr. Fane told me that he wished you to go away, but you would not because you could not bear to leave us. That was kind of you, my dear child, and I want you to know that we appreciate the help you have been to us. But I think that you did not want to leave him either, and that is better, for your place is by his side, and he needs you. Ah, I do not know what we should have done without that admirable man.”

“I am glad to think that he has been able to do something for you,” said Kitty.

“You must love him with all your heart, my dear. He is a saint.”

Kitty smiled and in her heart sighed. There was only one thing she could do for Walter now and that she could not think how to. She wanted him to forgive her, not for her sake any more, but for his own; for she felt that this alone could give him peace of mind. It was useless to ask him for his forgiveness, and if he had a suspicion that she desired it for his good rather than hers his stubborn vanity would make him refuse at all costs (it was curious that his vanity now did not irritate her, it seemed natural and only made her sorrier for him);and the only chance was that some unexpected occurrence might throw him off his guard. She had an idea that he would welcome an uprush of emotion which would liberate him from his nightmare of resentment, but that, in his pathetic folly, he would fight when it came with all his might against it.

Was it not pitiful that men, tarrying so short a space in a world where there was so much pain, should thus torture themselves?





60


Though the Mother Superior talked with Kitty not more than three or four times and once or twice for but ten minutes the impression she made upon Kitty was profound. Her character was like a country which on first acquaintance seems grand, but inhospitable; but in which presently you discover smiling little villages among fruit trees in the folds of the majestic mountains, and pleasant ambling rivers that flow kindly through lush meadows. But these comfortable scenes, though they surprise and even reassure you, are not enough to make you feel at home in the land of tawny heights and windswept spaces. It would have been impossible to become intimate with the Mother Superior; she had that something impersonal about her which Kitty had felt with the other nuns, even with the good-humored, chatty Sister St. Joseph, but with her it was a barrier which was almost palpable. It gave you quite a curious sensation, chilling but awe-inspiring, that she could walk on the same earth as you, attend to mundane affairs, and yet live so obviously upon a plane you could not reach. She once said to Kitty:

“It is not enough that a religious should be continually in prayer with Jesus; she should be herself a prayer.”

Though her conversation was interwoven with her religion, Kitty felt that this was natural to her and that no effort was made to influence the heretic. It seemed strange to her that the Mother Superior, with her deep sense of charity, should be content to leave Kitty in a condition of what seemed to her sinful ignorance.

One evening the two of them were sitting together. The days were shortening now and the mellow light of the evening was agreeable and a little melancholy. The Mother Superior looked very tired. Her tragic face was drawn and white; her fine dark eyes had lost their fire. Her fatigue perhaps urged her to a rare mood of confidence.

“This is a memorable day for me, my child,” she said, breaking from a long reverie, “for this is the anniversary of the day on which I finally determined to enter religion. For two years I had been thinking of it, but I had suffered as it were a fear of this calling, for I dreaded that I might be recaptured by the spirit of the world. But that morning when I communicated I made the vow that I would before nightfall announce my wish to my dear mother. After I had received the Holy Communion I asked Our Lord to give me peace of mind: Thou shalt have it only, the answer seemed to come to me, when thou hast ceased to desire it.”

The Mother Superior seemed to lose herself in thoughts of the past.

“That day, one of our friends, Madame de Viernot, had left for the Carmel without telling any of her relatives. She knew that they were opposed to her step, but she was a widow and thought that as such she had the right to do as she chose. One of my cousins had gone to bid farewell to the dear fugitive and did not come back till the evening. She was much moved. I had not spoken to my mother, I trembled at the thought of telling her what I had in mind, and yet I wished to keep the resolution I had made at Holy Communion. I asked my cousin all manner of questions. My mother, who appeared to be absorbed in her tapestry, lost no word. While I talked I said to myself: If I want to speak to-day I have not a minute to lose.

“It is strange how vividly I remember the scene. We were sitting round the table, a round table covered with a red cloth, and we worked by the light of a lamp with a green shade. My two cousins were staying with us and we were all working at tapestries to recover the chairs in the drawing-room. Imagine, they had not been recovered since the days of Louis ⅩIV, when they were bought, and they were so shabby and faded, my mother said it was a disgrace.

“I tried to form the words, but my lips would not move; and then, suddenly, after a few minutes of silence my mother said to me: ‘I really cannot understand the conduct of your friend. I do not like this leaving without a word all those to whom she is so dear. The gesture is theatrical and offends my taste. A well-bred woman does nothing which shall make people talk of her. I hope that if ever you caused us the great sorrow of leaving us you would not take flight as though you were committing a crime.’

“It was the moment to speak, but such was my weakness that I could only say:‘Ah, set your mind at rest, maman, I should not have the strength.’

“My mother made no answer and I repented because I had not dared to explain myself. I seemed to hear the word of Our Lord to St. Peter: ‘Peter, lovest thou me?' Oh, what weakness, what ingratitude was mine! I loved my comfort, the manner of my life, my family and my diversions. I was lost in these bitter thoughts when a little later, as though the conversation had not been interrupted, my mother said to me: ‘Still, my Odette, I do not think that you will die without having done something that will endure.’

“I was still lost in my anxiety and my reflections, while my cousins, never knowing the beating of my heart, worked quietly, when suddenly my mother, letting her tapestry fall and looking at me attentively, said: ‘Ah, my dear child, I am very sure that you will end by becoming a religious.’

“ ‘Are you speaking seriously, my good Mother,' I answered.‘You are laying bare the innermost thought and desire of my heart.’

“‘Mais oui,'cried my cousins without giving me time to finish,‘For two years Odette has thought of nothing else. But you will not give your permission, ma tante, you must not give your permission.’

“ ‘By what right, my dear children, should we refuse it,' said my mother, ‘if it is the Will of God?’

“My cousins then, wishing to make a jest of the conversation, asked me what I intended to do with the trifles that belonged to me and quarrelled gaily about which should take possession of this and which of that. But these first moments of gaiety lasted a very little while and we began to weep. Then we heard my father come up the stairs.”

The Mother Superior paused for a moment and sighed.

“It was very hard for my father. I was his only daughter and men often have a deeper feeling for their daughters than they ever have for their sons.”

“It is a great misfortune to have a heart,” said Kitty, with a smile.

“It is a great good fortune to consecrate that heart to the love of Jesus Christ.”

At that moment a little girl came up to the Mother Superior and confident in her interest showed her a fantastic toy that she had somehow got hold of. The Mother Superior put her beautiful, delicate hand round the child's shoulder and the child nestled up to her. It moved Kitty to observe how sweet her smile was and yet how impersonal.

“It is wonderful to see the adoration that all your orphans have for you, Mother,” she said. “I think I should be very proud if I could excite so great a devotion.”

The Mother Superior gave once more her aloof and yet beautiful smile.

“There is only one way to win hearts and that is to make oneself like unto those of whom one would be loved.”





61


Walter did not come back to dinner that evening. Kitty waited for him a little, for when he was detained in the city he always managed to send her word, but at last she sat down. She made no more than a pretense of eating the many courses which the Chinese cook, with his regard for propriety notwithstanding pestilence and the difficulty of provisioning, invariably set before her; and then, sinking into the long rattan chair by the open window, surrendered herself to the beauty of the starry night. The silence rested her.

She did not try to read. Her thoughts floated upon the surface of her mind like little white clouds reflected on a still lake. She was too tired to seize upon one, follow it up and absorb herself in its attendant train. She wondered vaguely what there was for her in the various impressions which her conversations with the nuns had left upon her. It was singular that, though their way of life so profoundly moved her, the faith which occasioned it left her untouched. She could not envisage the possibility that she might at any time be captured by the ardor of belief. She gave a little sigh: perhaps it would make everything easier if that great white light should illuminate her soul. Once or twice she had had the desire to tell the Mother Superior of her unhappiness and its cause; but she dared not: she could not bear that this austere woman should think ill of her. To her what she had done would naturally seem a grievous sin. The odd thing was that she herself could not regard it as wicked so much as stupid and ugly.

Perhaps it was due to an obtuseness in herself that she looked upon her connection with Townsend as regrettable and shocking even, but to be forgotten rather than to be repented of. It was like making a blunder at a party; there was nothing to do about it, it was dreadfully mortifying, but it showed a lack of sense to ascribe too much importance to it. She shuddered as she thought of Charlie with his large frame too well covered, the vagueness of his jaw, and the way he had of standing with his chest thrown out so that he might not seem to have a paunch. His sanguine temperament showed itself in the little red veins which soon would form a network on his ruddy cheeks. She had liked his bushy eyebrows: there was to her in them now something animal and repulsive.

And the future? It was curious how indifferent it left her; she could not see into it at all. Perhaps she would die when her baby was born. Her sister Doris had always been much stronger than she, and Doris had nearly died. (She had done her duty and produced an heir to the new baronetcy; Kitty smiled as she thought of her mother's satisfaction.) If the future was so vague it meant perhaps that she was destined never to see it. Walter would probably ask her mother to take care of the child--if the child survived; and she knew him well enough to be sure that, however uncertain of his paternity, he would treat it with kindness. Walter could be trusted under any circumstances to behave admirably. It was a pity that with his great qualities, his unselfishness and honor, his intelligence and sensibility, he should be so unlovable. She was not in the least frightened of him now, but sorry for him, and at the same time she could not help thinking him slightly absurd. The depth of his emotion made him vulnerable and she had a feeling that somehow and at some time she so could work upon it as to induce him to forgive her. The thought haunted her now that in thus giving him peace of mind she would make the only possible amends for the anguish she had caused him. It was a pity he had so little sense of humor: she could see them both, some day, laughing together at the way they had tormented themselves.

She was tired. She took the lamp into her room and undressed. She went to bed and presently fell asleep.





62


But she was awakened by a loud knocking. At first, since it was interwoven with the dream from which she was aroused, she could not attach the sound to reality. The knocking went on and she was conscious that it must be at the gateway of the compound. It was quite dark. She had a watch with phosphorised hands and saw that it was half past two. It must be Walter coming back--how late he was--and he could not awake the boy. The knocking went on, louder and louder, and in the silence of the night it was really not a little alarming. The knocking stopped and she heard the withdrawing of the heavy bolt. Walter had never come back so late. Poor thing, he must be tired out! She hoped he would have the sense to go straight to bed instead of working as usual in that laboratory of his.

There was a sound of voices, and people came into the compound. That was strange, for Walter coming home late, in order not to disturb her, took pains to be quiet. Two or three persons ran swiftly up the wooden steps and came into the room next door. Kitty was a little frightened. At the back of her mind was always the fear of an anti-foreign riot. Had something happened? Her heart began to beat quickly. But before she had time to put her vague apprehension into shape someone walked across the room and knocked at her door.

“Mrs. Fane.”

She recognised Waddington's voice.

“Yes. What is it?”

“Will you get up at once. I have something to say to you.”

She rose and put on a dressing-gown. She unlocked the door and opened it. Her glance took in Waddington in a pair of Chinese trousers and a pongee coat, the house-boy holding a hurricane lamp, and a little farther back three Chinese soldiers in khaki. She started as she saw the consternation on Waddington's face; his head was tousled as though he had just jumped out of bed.

“What is the matter?” she gasped.

“You must keep calm. There's not a moment to lose. Put on your clothes at once and come with me.”

“But what is it? Has something happened in the city?”

The sight of the soldiers suggested to her at once that there had been an outbreak and they were come to protect her.

“Your husband's been taken ill. We want you to come at once.”

“Walter?” she cried.

“You mustn't be upset. I don't exactly know what's the matter. Colonel Yü sent this officer to me and asked me to bring you to the Yamen at once.”

Kitty stared at him for a moment, she felt a sudden cold in her heart, and then she turned.

“I shall be ready in two minutes.”

“I came just as I was,” he answered. “I was asleep, I just put on a coat and some shoes.”

She did not hear what he said. She dressed by the light of the stars, taking the first things that came to hand; her fingers on a sudden were so clumsy that it seemed to take her an age to find the little clasps that closed her dress. She put round her shoulders the Cantonese shawl she had worn in the evening.

“I haven't put a hat on. There's no need, is there?”

“No.”

The boy held the lantern in front of them and they hurried down the steps and out of the compound gate.

“Take care you don't fall,” said Waddington. “You'd better hang on to my arm.”

The soldiers followed immediately behind them.

“Colonel Yü has sent chairs. They're waiting on the other side of the river.”

They walked quickly down the hill. Kitty could not bring herself to utter the question that trembled so horribly on her lips. She was mortally afraid of the answer. They came to the bank and there, with a thread of light at the bow, a sampan was waiting for them.

“Is it cholera?” she said then.

“I'm afraid so.”

She gave a little cry and stopped short.

“I think you ought to come as quickly as you can.” He gave her his hand to help her into the boat. The passage was short and the river almost stagnant; they stood in a bunch at the bow, while a woman with a child tied on her hip with one oar impelled the sampan across.

“He was taken ill this afternoon, the afternoon of yesterday that is,” said Waddington.

“Why wasn't I sent for at once?”

Although there was no reason for it they spoke in whispers. In the darkness Kitty could only feel how intense was her companion's anxiety.

“Colonel Yü wanted to, but he wouldn't let him. Colonel Yü has been with him all the time.”

“He ought to have sent for me all the same. It's heartless.”

“Your husband knew that you had never seen any one with cholera. It's a terrible and revolting sight. He didn't want you to see it.”

“After all he is my husband,” she said in a choking voice.

Waddington made no reply.

“Why am I allowed to come now?”

Waddington put his hand on her arm.

“My dear, you must be very brave. You must be prepared for the worst.”

She gave a wail of anguish and turned away a little, for she saw that the three Chinese soldiers were looking at her. She had a sudden strange glimpse of the whites of their eyes.

“Is he dying?”

“I only know the message Colonel Yü gave to this officer who came and fetched me. As far as I can judge collapse has set in.”

“Is there no hope at all?”

“I'm dreadfully sorry, I'm afraid that if we don't get there quickly we shan't find him alive.”

She shuddered. The tears began to stream down her cheeks.

“You see, he's been overworking, he has no powers of resistance.”

She withdrew from the pressure of his arm with a gesture of irritation. It exasperated her that he should talk in that low, anguished voice.

They reached the side and two men, Chinese coolies, standing on the bank helped her to step on shore. The chairs were waiting. As she got into hers Waddington said to her:

“Try and keep a tight hold on your nerves. You'll want all your self-control.”

“Tell the bearers to make haste.”

“They have orders to go as fast as they can.”

The officer, already in his chair, passed by and as he passed called out to Kitty's bearers. They raised the chair smartly, arranged the poles on their shoulders, and at a swift pace set off. Waddington followed close behind. They took the hill at a run, a man with a lantern going before each chair, and at the water-gate the gate-keeper was standing with a torch. The officer shouted to him as they approached and he flung open one side of the gate to let them through. He uttered some sort of interjection as they passed and the bearers called back. In the dead of the night those guttural sounds in a strange language were mysterious and alarming. They slithered up the wet and slippery cobbles of the alley and one of the officer's bearers stumbled. Kitty heard the officer's voice raised in anger, the shrill retort of the bearer, and then the chair in front hurried on again. The streets were narrow and tortuous. Here in the city was deep night. It was a city of the dead. They hastened along a narrow lane, turned a corner, and then at a run took a flight of steps; the bearers were beginning to blow hard; they walked with long, rapid strides, in silence; one took out a ragged handkerchief and as he walked wiped from his forehead the sweat that ran down into his eyes; they wound this way and that so that it might have been a maze through which they sped; in the shadow of the shuttered shops sometimes a form seemed to be lying, but you did not know whether it was a man who slept to awake at dawn or a man who slept to awake never; the narrow streets were ghostly in their silent emptiness and when on a sudden a dog barked loudly it sent a shock of terror through Kitty's tortured nerves. She did not know where they went. The way seemed endless. Could they not go faster? Faster. Faster. The time was going and any moment it might be too late.





63


Suddenly, walking along a blank long wall they came to a gateway flanked by sentry boxes, and the bearers set down the chairs. Waddington hurried up to Kitty. She had already jumped out. The officer knocked loudly on the door and shouted. A postern was opened and they passed into a courtyard. It was large and square. Huddled against the walls, under the eaves of the overhanging roofs, soldiers wrapped in their blankets were lying in huddled groups. They stopped for a moment while the officer spoke to a man who might have been a sergeant on guard. He turned and said something to Waddington.

“He's still alive,” said Waddington in a low voice. “Take care how you walk.”

Still preceded by the men with lanterns they made their way across the yard, up some steps, through a great doorway and then down into another wide court. On one side of this was a long chamber with lights in it; the lights within shining through the rice paper, silhouetted the elaborate pattern of the lattice. The lantern-bearers led them across the yard towards this room and at the door the officer, knocked. It was opened immediately and the officer with a glance at Kitty, stepped back.

“Will you walk in,” said Waddington.

It was a long, low room and the smoky lamps that lit it made the gloom ominous. Three or four orderlies stood about. On a pallet against the wall opposite the door a man was lying huddled under a blanket. An officer was standing motionless at the foot.

Kitty hurried up and leaned over the pallet. Walter lay with his eyes closed and in that sombrer light his face had the grayness of death. He was horribly still.

“Walter, Walter,” she gasped, in a low, terrified tone.

There was a slight movement in the body, or the shadow of a movement,; it was so slight it was like a breath of air which you cannot feel and yet for an instant ruffles the surface of still water.

“Walter, Walter, speak to me.”

The eyes were opened slowly, as though it were an infinite effort to raise those heavy lids, but he did not look, he stared at the wall a few inches from his face. He spoke; his voice, low and weak, had the hint of a smile in it.

“This is a pretty kettle of fish,” he said.

Kitty dared not breathe. He made no further sound, no beginning of a gesture, but his eyes, those dark, cold eyes of his (seeing now what mysteries?) stared at the whitewashed wall. Kitty raised herself to her feet. With haggard gaze she faced the man who stood there.

“Surely something can be done. You're not going to stand there and do nothing?”

She clasped her hands. Waddington spoke to the officer who stood at the end of the bed.

“I'm afraid they've done everything that was possible. The regimental surgeon has been treating him. Your husband has trained him and he's done all that your husband could do himself.”

“Is that the surgeon?”

“No, that is Colonel Yü. He's never left your husband's side.”

Distracted, Kitty gave him a glance. He was a tallish man, but stockily built, and he seemed ill at ease in his khaki uniform. He was looking at Walter and she saw that his eyes were wet with tears. It gave her a pang. Why should that man with his yellow, flat face have tears in his eyes? It exasperated her.

“It's awful to be able to do nothing.”

“At least he's not in pain any more,” said Waddington.

She leaned once more over her husband. Those ghastly eyes of his still stared vacantly in front of him. She could not tell if he saw with them. She did not know whether he had heard what was said. She put her lips close to his ears.

“Walter, isn't there something we can do?”

She thought that there must be some drug they could give him which would stay the dreadful ebbing of his life. Now that her eyes were more accustomed to the dimness, she saw with horror that his face had fallen. She would hardly have recognised him. It was unthinkable that in a few short hours he should look like another man; he hardly looked like a man at all; he looked like death.

She thought that he was making an effort to speak. She put her ear close.

“Don't fuss. I've had a rough passage, but I'm all right now.”

Kitty waited for a moment, but he was silent. His immobility rent her heart with anguish; it was terrifying that he should lie so still. He seemed prepared already for the stillness of the grave. Someone, the surgeon or a dresser, came forward and with a gesture motioned her aside; he leaned over the dying man and with a dirty rag wet his lips. Kitty stood up once more and turned to Waddington despairingly.

“Is there no hope at all?” she whispered.

He shook his head.

“How much longer can he live?”

“No one can tell. An hour perhaps.”

Kitty looked round the bare chamber and her eyes rested for an instant on the substantial form of Colonel Yü.

“Can I be left alone with him for a little while?” she asked. “Only for a minute.”

“Certainly, if you wish it.”

Waddington stepped over to the Colonel and spoke to him. The Colonel gave a little bow and then in a low tone an order.

“We shall wait on the steps,” said Waddington as they trooped out. “You have only to call.”

Now that the incredible had overwhelmed her consciousness, like a drug coursing through her veins, and she realized that Walter was going to die she had but one thought, and that was to make his end easier for him by dragging from his soul the rancor which poisoned it. If he could die at peace with her it seemed to her that he would die at peace with himself. She thought now not of herself at all but only of him.

“Walter, I beseech you to forgive me,” she said, leaning over him. For fear that he could not bear the pressure she took care not to touch him. “I'm so desperately sorry for the wrong I did you. I so bitterly regret it.”

He said nothing. He did not seem to hear. She was obliged to insist. It seemed to her strangely that his soul was a fluttering moth and its wings were heavy with hatred.

“Darling.”

A shadow passed over his wan and sunken face. It was less than a movement, and yet it gave all the effect of a terrifying convulsion. She had never used that word to him before. Perhaps in his dying brain there passed the thought, confused and difficultly grasped, that he had only heard her use it, a commonplace of her vocabulary, to dogs and babies and motor-cars. Then something horrible occurred. She clenched her hands, trying with all her might to control herself, for she saw two tears run slowly down his wasted cheeks.

“Oh, my precious, my dear, if you ever loved me--I know you loved me and I was hateful--I beg you to forgive me. I've no chance now to show my repentance. Have mercy on me. I beseech you to forgive.”

She stopped. She looked at him, all breathless, waiting passionately for a reply. She saw that he tried to speak. Her heart gave a great bound. It seemed to her that it would be in a manner a reparation for the suffering she had caused him if at this last moment she could effect his deliverance from that load of bitterness. His lips moved. He did not look at her. His eyes stared unseeing at the white-washed wall. She leaned over him so that she might hear. But he spoke quite clearly.

“The dog it was that died.”

She stayed as still as though she were turned to stone. She could not understand and gazed at him in terrified perplexity. It was meaningless. Delirium. He had not understood a word she said.

It was impossible to be so still and yet to live. She stared. His eyes were open. She could not tell if he breathed. She began to grow frightened.

“Walter,” she whispered. “Walter.”

At last, suddenly, she raised herself. A sudden fear seized her. She turned and went to the door.

“Will you come, please. He doesn't seem to…”

They stepped in. The Chinese surgeon went up to the bed. He had an electric torch in his hand and he lit it and looked at Walter's eyes. Then he closed them. He said something in Chinese. Waddington put his arm round Kitty.

“I'm afraid he's dead.”

Kitty gave a deep sigh. A few tears fell from her eyes. She felt dazed rather than overcome. The Chinese stood about, round the bed, helplessly, as though they did not quite know what to do next. Waddington was silent. In a minute the Chinese began to speak in a low tone among themselves.

“You'd better let me take you back to the bungalow,” said Waddington. “He'll be brought there.”

Kitty passed her hand wearily across her forehead. She went up to the pallet bed and leaned over it. She kissed Walter gently on the lips. She was not crying now.

“I'm sorry to give you so much trouble.”

The officers saluted as she passed and she gravely bowed. They walked back across the courtyard and got into their chairs. She saw Waddington light a cigarette. A little smoke lost in the air, that was the life of man.





64


Dawn was breaking now, and here and there a Chinese was taking down the shutters of his shop. In its dark recesses, by the light of a taper, a woman was washing her hands and face. In a tea-house at a corner a group of men were eating an early meal. The grey, cold light of the rising day sidled along the narrow lanes like a thief. There was a pale mist on the river and the masts of the crowded junks loomed through it like the lances of a phantom army. It was chilly as they crossed and Kitty huddled herself up in her gay and colored shawl. They walked up the hill and they were above the mist. The sun shone from an unclouded sky. It shone as though this were a day like another and nothing had happened to distinguish it from its fellows.

“Wouldn't you like to lie down?” said Waddington when they entered the bungalow.

“No, I'll sit at the window.”

She had sat at the window so often and so long during the weeks that had passed and her eyes now were so familiar with the fantastic, garish, beautiful, and mysterious temple on its great bastion that it rested her spirit. It was so unreal, even in the crude light of mid-day, that it withdrew her from the reality of life.

“I'll get the boy to make you some tea. I'm afraid it will be necessary to bury him this morning. I'll make all the arrangements.”

“Thank you.”





65


They buried him three hours later. It seemed horrible to Kitty that he must be put into a Chinese coffin, as though in so strange a bed he must rest uneasily, but there was no help for it. The nuns, learning of Walter's death as they learned everything that happened in the city, sent by a messenger a cross of dahlias, stiff and formal, but made as though by the accustomed hands of a florist; and the cross, alone on the Chinese coffin, looked grotesque and out of place. When all was ready they had to wait for Colonel Yü who had sent to Waddington to say that he desired to attend the funeral. He came accompanied by an A.D.C. They walked up the hill, the coffin borne by half a dozen coolies, to a little plot of land where lay buried the missionary whose place Walter had taken. Waddington had found among the missionary's effects an English prayer-book and in a low voice, with an embarrassment that was unusual to him, read the burial service. Perhaps, reciting those solemn but terrible words, the thought hovered in his mind that if he in his turn fell a victim to the pestilence there would be no one now to say them over him. The coffin was lowered into the grave and the grave-diggers began to throw in the earth.

Colonel Yü, who had stood with bared head by the grave-side, put on his hat, saluted Kitty gravely, said a word or two to Waddington, and followed by his A.D.C. walked away. The coolies, curious to watch a Christian burial, had lingered and now in a straggling group, their yokes trailing in their hands, sauntered off. Kitty and Waddington waited till the grave was filled and then placed on the mound, smelling of fresh earth, the nuns' prim dahlias. She had not wept, but when the first shovelful of earth rattled on the coffin she felt a dreadful pang at her heart.

She saw that Waddington was waiting for her to come away.

“Are you in a hurry?” she asked. “I don't want to go back to the bungalow just yet.”

“I have nothing to do. I am entirely in your hands.”





66


They sauntered along the causeway till they came to the top of the hill on which stood that archway, the memorial to a virtuous widow, which had occupied so large a part of Kitty's impression of the place. It was a symbol, but of what she scarcely knew; she could not tell why it bore a note of so sardonic irony.

“Shall we sit down a little? We haven't sat here for ages.” The plain was spread before her widely; it was tranquil and serene in the morning light. “It's only a few weeks that I've been here and it seems a lifetime.”

He did not answer and for a while she allowed her thoughts to wander. She gave a sigh.

“Do you think that the soul is immortal?” she asked.

He did not seem surprised at the question.

“How should I know?”

“Just now, when they'd washed Walter, before they put him into the coffin, I looked at him. He looked very young. Too young to die. Do you remember that beggar that we saw the first time you took me for a walk? I was frightened not because he was dead, but because he looked as though he'd never been a human being. He was just a dead animal. And now again, with Walter, it looked so like a machine that has run down. That's what is so frightening. And if it is only a machine how futile is all this suffering and the heart pains and the misery.”

He did not answer, but his eyes travelled over the landscape at their feet. The wide expanse on that gay and sunny morning filled the heart with exultation. The trim little rice-fields stretched as far as the eye could see and in many of them the blue-clad peasants with their buffaloes were working industriously. It was a peaceful and a happy scene. Kitty broke the silence.

“I can't tell you how deeply moved I've been by all I've seen at the convent. They're wonderful, those nuns, they make me feel utterly worthless. They give up everything, their home, their country, love, children, freedom; and all the little things which I sometimes think must be harder still to give up, flowers and green fields, going for a walk on an autumn day, books and music, comfort, everything they give up, everything. And they do it so that they may devote themselves to a life of sacrifice and poverty, obedience, killing work and prayer. To all of them this world is really and truly a place of exile. Life is a cross which they willingly bear, but in their hearts all the time is the desire--oh, it's so much stronger than desire, it's a longing, an eager, passionate longing for the death which shall lead them to life everlasting.”

Kitty clasped her hands and looked at him with anguish.

“Well?”

“Supposing there is no life everlasting? Think what it means if death is really the end of all things. They've given up all for nothing. They've been cheated. They're dupes.”

Waddington reflected for a little while.

“I wonder. I wonder if it matters that what they have aimed at is illusion. Their lives are in themselves beautiful. I have an idea that the only thing which makes it possible to regard this world we live in without disgust is the beauty which now and then men create out of the chaos. The pictures they paint, the music they compose, the books they write, and the lives they lead. Of all these the richest in beauty is the beautiful life. That is the perfect work of art.”

Kitty sighed. What he said seemed hard. She wanted more.

“Have you ever been to a symphony concert?” he continued.

“Yes,” she smiled. “I know nothing of music, but I'm rather fond of it.”

“Each member of the orchestra plays his own little instrument, and what do you think he knows of the complicated harmonies which unroll themselves on the indifferent air? He is concerned only with his own small share. But he knows that the symphony is lovely, and though there's none to hear it, it is lovely still, and he is content to play his part.”

“You spoke of Tao the other day,” said Kitty, after a pause. “Tell me what it is.”

Waddington gave her a little look, hesitated an instant, and then with a faint smile on his comic face answered:

“It is the Way and the Waygoer. It is the eternal road along which walk all beings, but no being made it, for itself is being. It is everything and nothing. From it all things spring, all things conform to it, and to it at last all things return. It is a square without angles, a sound which ears cannot hear, and an image without form. It is a vast net and though its meshes are as wide as the sea it lets nothing through. It is the sanctuary where all things find refuge. It is nowhere, but without looking out of the window you may see it. Desire not to desire, it teaches, and leave all things to take their course. He that humbles himself shall be preserved entire. He that bends shall be made straight. Failure is the foundation of success and success is the lurking-place of failure; but who can tell when the turning point will come? He who strives after tenderness can become even as a little child. Gentleness brings victory to him who attacks and safety to him who defends. Mighty is he who conquers himself.”

“Does it mean anything?”

“Sometimes, when I've had half a dozen whiskies and look at the stars, I think perhaps it does.”

Silence fell upon them and when it was broken it was again by Kitty.

“Tell me, is the dog it was that died, a quotation?”

Waddington's lips outlined a smile and he was ready with his answer. But perhaps at that moment his sensibilities were abnormally acute. Kitty was not looking at him, but there was something about her expression which made him change his mind.

“If it is I don't know it,” he answered warily. “Why?”

“Nothing. It crossed my mind. It had a familiar ring.”

There was another silence.

“When you were alone with your husband,” said Waddington presently, “I had a talk with the regimental surgeon. I thought we ought to have some details.”

“Well?”

“He was in a very hysterical state. I couldn't really quite understand what he meant. So far as I can make out your husband got infected during the course of experiments he was making.”

“He was always experimenting. He wasn't really a doctor, he was a bacteriologist; that is why he was so anxious to come here.”

“But I can't quite make out from the surgeon's statements whether he was infected accidentally or whether he was actually experimenting on himself.”

Kitty grew very pale. The suggestion made her shudder. Waddington took her hand.

“Forgive me for talking about this again,” he said gently, “but I thought it might comfort you--I know how frightfully difficult it is on these occasions to say anything that is of the least use--I thought it might mean something to you that Walter died a martyr to science and to his duty.”

Kitty shrugged her shoulders with a suspicion of impatience.

“Walter died of a broken heart,” she said.

Waddington did not answer. She turned and looked at him slowly. Her face was white and set.

“What did he mean by saying: the dog it was that died? What is it?”

“It's the last line of Goldsmith's Elegy”.





67


Next morning Kitty went to the convent. The girl who opened the door seemed surprised to see her and when Kitty had been for a few minutes about her work the Mother Superior came in. She went up to Kitty and took her hand.

“I am glad to see you, my dear child. You show a fine courage in coming back here so soon after your great sorrow; and wisdom, for I am sure that a little work will keep you from brooding.”

Kitty cast down her eyes, reddening a little; she did not want the Mother Superior to see into her heart.

“I need not tell you how sincerely all of us here sympathise with you.”

“You are very kind,” whispered Kitty.

“We all pray for you constantly and for the soul of him you have lost.”

Kitty made no reply. The Mother Superior released her hand and in her cool, authoritative tone imposed various tasks upon her. She patted two or three children on the head, gave them her aloof, but winning smile, and went about her more pressing affairs.





68


A week went by. Kitty was sewing. The Mother Superior entered the room and sat down beside her. She gave Kitty's work a shrewd glance.

“You sew very well, my dear. It is a rare accomplishment for young women of your world nowadays.”

“I owe it to my mother.”

“I am sure that your mother will be very glad to see you again.”

Kitty looked up. There was that in the Mother Superior's manner which prevented the remark from being taken as a casual politeness. She went on.

“I allowed you to come here after the death of your dear husband because I thought occupation would distract your mind. I did not think you were fit at that moment to take the long journey to Hong Kong by yourself, nor did I wish you to sit alone in your house with nothing to do but to remember your loss. But now eight days have passed. It is time for you to go.”

“I don't want to go, Mother. I want to stay here.”

“There is nothing for you to stay for. You came to be with your husband. Your husband is dead. You are in a condition in which you will shortly need a care and attention which it is impossible for you to get here. It is your duty, my dear child, to do everything in your power for the welfare of the being that God has entrusted to your care.”

Kitty was silent for a moment. She looked down.

“I was under the impression that I was of some use here. It has been a great pleasure to me to think that I was. I hoped that you would allow me to go on with my work till the epidemic had come to an end.”

“We are all very grateful for what you have done for us,” answered the Superior, with a slight smile, “but now that the epidemic is waning the risk of coming here is not so great and I am expecting two sisters from Canton. They should be here very shortly and when they arrive I do not think that I shall be able to make any use of your services.”

Kitty's heart sank. The Mother Superior's tone admitted of no reply; she knew her well enough to know that she would be insensible to entreaty. That she found it necessary to reason with Kitty had brought into her voice a note, if hardly of irritation, at leat of the peremptoriness which might lead to it.

“Mr. Waddington was good enough to ask my advice.”

“I wish he could have minded his own business,” interrupted Kitty.

“If he hadn't I should all the same have felt obliged to give it to him,” said the Mother Superior gently. “At the present moment your place is not here, but with your mother. Mr. Waddington has arranged with Colonel Yü to give you a strong escort so that you will be perfectly safe on the journey, and he has arranged for bearers and coolies. The amah will go with you and arrangements will be made at the cities you pass through. In fact, everything possible for your comfort has been done.”

Kitty's lips tightened. She thought that they might at least have consulted her in a matter which only concerned herself. She had to exercise some self-control in order not to answer sharply.

“And when am I to start?”

The Mother Superior remained quite placid.

“The sooner you can get back to Hong Kong and then sail to England the better, my dear child. We thought you would like to start at dawn the day after to-morrow.”

“So soon.”

Kitty felt a little inclined to cry. But it was true enough; she had no place there.

“You all seem in a great hurry to be rid of me,” she said ruefully.

Kitty was conscious of a relaxation in the Superior's demeanour. She saw that Kitty was prepared to yield and unconsciously she assumed a more gracious tone. Kitty's sense of humour was acute and her eyes twinkled as she reflected that even the saints liked to have their own way.

“Don't think that I fail to appreciate the goodness of your heart, my dear child, and the admirable charity which makes you unwilling to abandon your self-imposed duties.”

Kitty stared straight in front of her. She faintly shrugged her shoulders. She knew that she could ascribe to herself no such exalted virtues. She wanted to stay because she had nowhere else to go. It was a curious sensation this, that nobody in the world cared two straws whether she was alive or dead.

“I cannot understand that you should be reluctant to go home,” pursued the Superior amiably. “There are many foreigners in this country who would give a great deal to have your chance!”

“But not you, Mother?”

“Oh, with us it is different, my dear child. When we come here we know that we have left our homes for ever.”

Out of her own wounded feelings emerged the desire in Kitty's mind, malicious perhaps, to seek the joint in the armour of faith which rendered the nuns so aloofly immune to all the natural feelings. She wanted to see whether there was left in the Superior any of the weakness of humanity.

“I should have thought that sometimes it was hard never to see again those that are dear to you and the scenes amid which you were brought up.”

The Mother Superior hesitated for a moment, but Kitty watching her, could see no change in the serenity of her beautiful and austere face.

“It is hard for my mother who is old now, for I am her only daughter and she would dearly like to see me once more before she dies. I wish I could give her that joy. But it cannot be and we shall wait till we can meet in paradise.”

“All the same, when one thinks of those to whom one is so dear, it must be difficult not to ask oneself if one was right in cutting oneself off from them.”

“Are you asking me if I have ever regretted the step I took?”On a sudden the Mother Superior's face grew radiant. “Never, never. I have exchanged a life that was trivial and worthless for one of sacrifice and prayer.”

There was a brief silence and then the Mother Superior, assuming a lighter manner, smiled.

“I am going to ask you to take a little parcel and post it for me when you get to Marseilles. I do not wish to entrust it to the Chinese post office. I will fetch it at once.”

“You can give it to me to-morrow,” said Kitty.

“You will be too busy to come here to-morrow, my dear. It will be more convenient for you to bid us farewell to-night.”

She rose, and, with the easy dignity which her voluminous habit could not conceal, left the room. In a moment Sister St. Joseph came in. She was come to say good-bye. She hoped that Kitty would have a pleasant journey; she would be quite safe, for Colonel Yü was sending a strong escort with her; and the sisters constantly did the journey alone and no harm came to them. And did she like the sea? Mon Dieu, how ill she was when there was a storm in the Indian ocean, Madame her mother would be pleased to see her daughter, and she must take care of herself; after all she had another little soul in her care now, and they would all pray for her; she would pray constantly for her and the dear little baby and for the soul of the poor, brave doctor. She was voluble, kindly, and affectionate; and yet Kitty was deeply conscious that for Sister St. Joseph (her gaze intent on eternity) she was but a wraith without body or substance. She had a wild impulse to seize the stout, good-natured nun by the shoulders and shake her, crying: “Don't you know that I'm a human being, unhappy and alone, and I want comfort and sympathy and encouragement; oh, can't you turn a minute away from God and give me a little compassion; not the Christian compassion that you have for all suffering things, but just human compassion for me?” The thought brought a smile to Kitty's lips: how very surprised Sister St. Joseph would be! She would certainly be convinced of what now she only suspected, that all English people were mad.

“Fortunately I am a very good sailor,” Kitty answered. “I've never been sea-sick yet.”

The Mother Superior returned with a small, neat parcel.

“They're handkerchiefs that I've had made for the nameday of my mother,” she said. “The initials have been embroidered by our young girls.”

Sister St. Joseph suggested that Kitty would like to see how beautifully the work was done and the Mother Superior with an indulgent, deprecating smile untied the parcel. The handkerchiefs were of very fine lawn and the initials embroidered in a complicated cipher were surmounted by a crown of strawberry leaves. When Kitty had properly admired the workmanship, the handkerchiefs were wrapped up again and the parcel handed to her. Sister St. Joseph, with an “Eh bien, Madame, je vous quitte” and a repetition of her polite and impersonal salutations, went away. Kitty realized that this was the moment to take her leave of the Superior. She thanked her for her kindness to her. They walked together along the bare, white-washed corridors.

“Would it be asking too much of you to register the parcel when you arrive at Marseilles?” said the Superior.

“Of course I'll do that,” said Kitty.

She glanced at the address. The name seemed very grand, but the place mentioned attracted her attention.

“But that is one of the châteaux I've seen. I was motoring with friends in France.”

“It is very possible,” said the Mother Superior. “Strangers are permitted to view it on two days a week.”

“I think if I had ever lived in such a beautiful place I should never have had the courage to leave it.”

“It is of Course a historical monument. It is scarcely intimate. If I regretted anything it would not be that, but the little château that we lived in when I was a child. It was in the Pyrenees. I was born within sound of the sea. I do not deny that sometimes I should like to hear the waves beating against the rocks.”

Kitty had an idea that the Mother Superior, divining her thought and the reason for her remarks, was slyly making fun of her. But they reached the little, unpretentious door of the convent. To Kitty's surprise the Mother Superior took her in her arms and kissed her. The pressure of her pale lips on Kitty's cheeks, she kissed her first on one side and then on the other, was so unexpected that it made her flush and inclined to cry.

“Good-bye, God bless you, my dear child.” She held her for a moment in her arms. “Remember that it is nothing to do your duty, that is demanded of you and is no more meritorious than to wash your hands when they are dirty; the only thing that counts is the love of duty; when love and duty are one, then grace is in you and you will enjoy a happiness which passes all understanding.”

The convent door closed for the last time behind her.

Waddington walked with Kitty up the hill and they turned aside for a moment to look at Walter's grave; at the memorial arch he said good-bye to her, and looking at it for the last time she felt that she could reply to the enigmatic irony of its appearance with an equal irony of her own. She stepped into her chair.

One day passed after the other. The sights of the wayside served as a background to her thoughts. She saw them as it were in duplicate, rounded as though in a stereoscope, with an added significance because to everything she saw was added the recollection of what she had seen when but a few short weeks before she had taken the same journey in the contrary direction. The coolies with their loads straggled disorderly, two or three together, and then a hundred yards behind one by himself, and then two or three more; the soldiers of the escort shuffled along with a clumsy walk that covered five and twenty miles a day; the amah was carried by two bearers and Kitty, not because she was heavier, but for face sake, by four. Now and then they met a string of coolies lolloping by in line with their heavy burdens, now and then a Chinese official in a sedan who looked at the white woman with inquisitive eyes; now they came across peasants in faded blue and huge hats on their way to market and now a woman, old or young, tottering along on her bound feet. They passed up and down little hills laid out with trim rice-fields and farm-houses nestling cozily in a grove of bamboos; they passed through ragged villages and populous cities walled like the cities in a missal. The sun of the early autumn was pleasant, and if at daybreak, when the shimmering dawn lent the neat fields the enchantment of a fairy tale, it was cold, the warmth later was very grateful. Kitty was filled by it with a sense of beatitude which she made no effort to resist.

The vivid scenes with their elegant color, their unexpected distinction, and their strangeness, were like an arras before which, like mysterious, shadowy shapes, played the phantoms of Kitty's fancy. They seemed wholly unreal. Mei-tan-fu with its crenellated walls was like the painted canvas placed on the stage in an old play to represent a city. The nuns, Waddington, and the Manchu woman who loved him, were fantastic characters in a masque; and the rest, the people sidling along the tortuous streets and those who died, were nameless supers. Of course it had, they all had, a significance of some sort, but what was it? It was as though they performed a ritual dance, elaborate and ancient, and you knew that those complicated measures had a meaning which it was important for you to know; and yet you could see no clue, no clue.

It seemed incredible to Kitty (an old woman was passing along the causeway, in blue, and the blue in the sunshine was like lapis lazuli; her face with its thousand little wrinkles was like a mask of old ivory; and she leaned, as she walked on her tiny feet, on a long black staff) it seemed incredible to Kitty that she and Walter had taken part in that strange and unreal dance. They had played important parts too. She might easily have lost her life: he had. Was it a joke? Perhaps it was nothing but a dream from which she would suddenly awake with a sigh of relief. It seemed to have taken place a long time ago and in a far-off place. It was singular how shadowy the persons of that play seemed against the sunny background of real life. And now it seemed to Kitty like a story that she was reading; it was a little startling that it seemed to concern her so little. She found already that she could not recall with distinctness Waddington's face which had been so familiar to her.

This evening they should reach the city on the Western River from which she was to take the steamer. Thence it was but a night's run to Hong Kong.

At first because she had not wept when Walter died she was ashamed. It seemed dreadfully callous. Why, the eyes of the Chinese officer, Colonel Yü, had been wet with tears. She was dazed by her husband's death. It was difficult to understand that he would not come into the bungalow again and that when he got up in the morning she would not hear him take his bath in the Suchow tub. He was alive and now he was dead. The sisters wondered at her Christian resignation and admired the courage with which she bore her loss. But Waddington was shrewd; for all his grave sympathy she had a feeling that--how should she put it?--that he had his tongue in his cheek. Of course, Walter's death had been a shock to her. She didn't want him to die. But after all she didn't love him, she had never loved him; it was decent to bear herself with becoming sorrow; it would be ugly and vulgar even to let any one see in her heart; but she had gone through too much to make pretenses to herself. It seemed to her that this at least the last few weeks had taught her, that if it is necessary sometimes to lie to others it is always despicable to lie to oneself. She was sorry that Walter had died in that tragic manner, but she was sorry with a purely human sorrow such as she might have felt if it had been an acquaintance. She would acknowledge that Walter had admirable qualities; it just happened that she did not like him; he had always bored her. She would not admit that his death was a relief to her, she could say honestly that if by a word of hers she could bring him back to life she would say it, but she could not resist the feeling that his death made her way to some extent a trifle easier. They would never have been happy together and yet to part would have been terribly difficult. She was startled at herself for feeling as she did; she supposed that people would think her heartless and cruel if they knew. Well, they shouldn't know. She wondered if all her fellows had in their hearts shameful secrets which they spent their time guarding from curious glances.

She looked very little into the future and she made no plans. The only thing she knew was that she wanted to stay in Hong Kong as short a while as might be. She looked forward to arriving there with horror. It seemed to her that she would like to wander for ever through that smiling and friendly country in her rattan chair, and, an indifferent spectator for ever of the phantasmagoria of life, pass each night under a different roof. But of course the immediate future must be faced: she would go to the hotel when she reached Hong Kong, she would arrange about getting rid of the house and selling the furniture; there would be no need to see Townsend. He would have the grace to keep out of her way. She would like, all the same, to see him once more in order to tell him what a despicable creature she thought him.

But what did Charles Townsend matter?

Like a rich melody on a harp that rang in exultant arpeggios through the complicated harmonies of a symphony, one thought beat in her heart insistently. It was this thought which gave their exotic beauty to the rice-fields, which made a little smile break on her pale lips as a smooth-faced lad swung past her on his way to the market town with exultation in his carriage and audacity in his eyes, and which gave the magic of a tumultuous life to the cities she passed through. The city of the pestilence was a prison from which she was escaped, and she had never known before how exquisite was the blueness of the sky and what a joy there was in the bamboo copses that leaned with such an adorable grace across the causeway. Freedom! That was the thought that sung in her heart so that even though the future was so dim, it was iridescent like the mist over the river where the morning sun fell upon it. Freedom! Not only freedom from a bond that irked, and a companionship which depressed her; freedom, not only from the death which had threatened, but freedom from the love that had degraded her; freedom from all spiritual ties, the freedom of a disembodied spirit; and with freedom, courage, and a valiant unconcern for whatever was to come.

When the boat docked at Hong Kong, Kitty, who had been standing on the deck to look at the colored, gay, and vivacious traffic of the river, went into her cabin to see that the amah had left nothing behind. She gave herself a look in the glass. She wore black, the nuns had dyed a dress for her, but not mourning; and the thought crossed her mind that the first thing she must do was to see to this. The habiliments of woe could not but serve as an effective disguise to her unexpected feelings. There was a knock on her cabin door. The amah opened it.

“Mrs. Fane.”

Kitty turned and saw a face which at the first moment she did not recognize. Then her heart gave a sudden quick beat and she flushed. It was Dorothy Townsend. Kitty so little expected to see her that she knew neither what to do nor what to say. But Mrs. Townsend came into the cabin and with an impulsive gesture took Kitty in her arms.

“Oh, my dear, my dear, I'm so dreadfully sorry for you.”

Kitty allowed herself to be kissed. She was a little surprised at this effusiveness in a woman whom she had always thought cold and distant.

“It's very kind of you,” murmured Kitty.

“Come on deck. The amah will look after your things and my boys are here.”

She took Kitty's hand and Kitty, allowing herself to be led, noticed that her good-natured, weather-beaten face bore an expression of real concern.

“Your boat's early, I very nearly didn't get down in time,” said Mrs. Townsend. “I couldn't have borne it if I'd missed you.”

“But you didn't come to meet me?” exclaimed Kitty.

“Of course I did.”

“But how did you know I was coming?”

“Mr. Waddington sent me a telegram.”

Kitty turned away. She had a lump in her throat. It was funny that a little unexpected kindness should so affect her. She did not want to cry; she wished Dorothy Townsend would go away. But Dorothy took the hand that was hanging by Kitty's side and pressed it. It embarrassed Kitty that this shy woman should be so demonstrative.

“I want you to do me a great favor. Charlie and I want you to come and stay with us while you're in Hong Kong.”

Kitty snatched her hand away.

“It's awfully kind of you. I couldn't possibly.”

“But you must. You can't go and live all by yourself in your own house. It would be dreadful for you. I've prepared everything. You shall have your own sitting-room. You can have your meals there if you don't care to have them with us. We both want you to come.”

“I wasn't thinking of going to the house. I was going to get myself a room at the Hong Kong Hotel. I couldn't possibly put you to so much trouble.”

The suggestion had taken her by surprise. She was confused and vexed. If Charlie had had any sense of decency he would never have allowed his wife to make the invitation. She did not wish to be under an obligation to either of them.

“Oh, but I couldn't bear the idea of your living at a hotel. And you'd hate the Hong Kong Hotel just now. With all those people about and the band playing jazz all the time. Please say you'll come to us. I promise you that Charlie and I won't bother you.”

“I don't know why you should be so kind to me.” Kitty was getting a little short of excuses; she could not bring herself to utter a blunt and definite no. “I'm afraid I'm not very good company among strangers just now.”

“But need we be strangers to you? Oh, I do so want not to be, I so want you to allow me to be your friend.” Dorothy clasped her hands and her voice, her cool, deliberate, and distinguished voice, was tremulous with tears. “I so awfully want you to come. You see, I want to make amends to you.”

Kitty did not understand. She did not know what amends Charlie's wife owed her.

“I'm afraid I didn't very much like you at first. I thought you rather fast. You see, I'm old-fashioned and I suppose I'm intolerant.”

Kitty gave her a passing glance. What she meant was that at first she had thought Kitty vulgar. Though Kitty allowed no shadow of it to show on her face in her heart she laughed. Much she cared for what any one thought of her now!

“And when I heard that you'd gone with your husband into the jaws of death, without a moment's hesitation, I felt such a frightful cad. I felt so humiliated. You've been so wonderful, you've been so brave, you make all the rest of us look so dreadfully cheap and second-rate.” Now the tears were pouring down her kind, homely face. “I can't tell you how much I admire you and what a respect I have for you. I know I can do nothing to make up for your terrible loss, but I want you to know how deeply, how sincerely I feel for you. And if you'll only allow me to do a little something for you it will be a privilege. Don't bear me a grudge because I misjudged you. You're heroic and I'm just a silly fool of a woman.”

Kitty looked down at the deck. She was very pale. She wished that Dorothy would not show such uncontrollable emotion. She was touched, it was true, but she could not help a slight feeling of impatience that this simple creature should believe such lies.

“If you really mean that you'd like to have me, of course I shall be glad to come,” she sighed.





72


The Townsends lived on the Peak in a house with a wide view over the sea, and Charlie did not as a rule come up to luncheon, but on the day of Kitty's arrival Dorothy (they were Kitty and Dorothy to one another by now) told her that if she felt up to seeing him he would like to come and bid her welcome. Kitty reflected that since she must see him she might just as well see him at once, and she looked forward with grim amusement to the embarrassment she must cause him. She saw very well that the invitation to stay had arisen in his wife's fancy and notwithstanding his own feelings he had immediately approved. Kitty knew how great his desire was always to do the right thing, and to offer her a gracious hospitality was obviously very much the right thing. But he could hardly remember that last interview of theirs without mortification: to a man so vain as Townsend it must be galling like an ulcer that would not heal. She hoped that she had hurt him as much as he had hurt her. He must hate her now. She was glad to think that she did not hate, but only despised him. It gave her a sardonic satisfaction to reflect that whatever his feelings he would be obliged to make much of her. When she left his office that afternoon he must have hoped with all his heart that he would never set eyes on her again.

And now, sitting with Dorothy, she waited for him to come in. She was conscious of her delight in the sober luxury of the drawing-room. She sat in an arm-chair, there were lovely flowers here and there, on the walls were pleasing pictures; the room was shaded and cool, it was friendly and homelike. She remembered with a faint shudder the bare and empty parlor of the missionary's bungalow; the rattan chairs and the kitchen table with its cotton cloth, the stained shelves with all those cheap editions of novels, and the little skimpy red curtains that had such a dusty look. Oh, it had been so uncomfortable! She supposed that Dorothy had never thought of that.

They heard a motor drive up, and Charlie strode into the room.

“Am I late? I hope I haven't kept you waiting. I had to see the Governor and I simply couldn't get away.”

He went up to Kitty, and took both her hands.

“I'm so very, very glad you've come here. I know Dorothy has told you that we want you to stay as long as ever you like and that we want you to look upon our house as your home. But I want to tell you so myself as well. If there's anything in the world I can do for you I shall only be too happy.” His eyes wore a charming expression of sincerity; she wondered if he saw the irony in hers. “I'm awfully stupid at saying some things and I don't want to seem a clumsy fool, but I do want you to know how deeply I sympathize with you in your husband's death. He was a thundering good chap, and he'll be missed here more than I can say.”

“Don't, Charlie,” said his wife. “I'm sure Kitty understands.…Here are the cocktails.”

Following the luxurious custom of the foreigners in China two boys in uniform came into the room with savouries and cocktails. Kitty refused.

“Oh, you must have one,” insisted Townsend in his breezy, cordial way. “It'll do you good and I'm sure you haven't had such a thing as a cocktail since you left Hong Kong. Unless I'm very much mistaken you couldn't get ice at Mei-tan-fu.”

“You're not mistaken,” said Kitty.

For a moment she had a picture before her mind's eye of that beggar with the tousled head in the blue rags through which you saw the emaciated limbs, who had lain dead against the compound wall.





73


They went in to luncheon. Charlie, sitting at the head of his table, easily took charge of the conversation. After those first few words of sympathy he treated Kitty, not as though she had just suffered a devastating experience, but rather as though she had come in from Shanghai for a change after an operation for appendicitis. She needed cheering and he was prepared to cheer her. The best way of making her feel at home was to treat her as one of the family. He was a tactful man. He began talking of the autumn race meeting, and the polo--by Jove, he would have to give up playing polo if he couldn't get his weight down--and a chat he had had that morning with the Governor. He spoke of a party they had been to on the Admiral's flag-ship, the state of affairs in Canton, and of the links at Lushan. In a few minutes Kitty felt that she might have been away for no longer than a weekend. It was incredible that over there, up country, six hundred miles away only (the distance from London to Edinburgh, wasn't it?) men, women, and children had been dying like flies. Soon she found herself asking about so and so who had broken a collar bone at polo and if Mrs. This had gone home or Mrs. That was playing in the tennis tournament. Charlie made his little jokes and she smiled at them. Dorothy with her faint air of superiority (which now included Kitty and so was no longer slightly offensive, but a bond of union rather) was gently ironic about various persons in the colony. Kitty began to feel more alert.

“Why, she's looking better already,” said Charlie to his wife.“She was so pale before tiffin that I was quite startled; she's really got some color in her cheeks now.”

But while she took her part in the conversation, if not with gaiety (for she felt that neither Dorothy nor Charlie with his admirable sense of decorum would approve of that) at least with cheerfulness, Kitty observed her host. In all those weeks during which her fancy had been revengefully occupied with him she had built up in her mind a very vivid impression of him. His thick curling hair was a little too long and too carefully brushed, in order to hide the fact that it was graying, there was too much oil on it; his face was too red, with its network of mauve veins on the cheeks, and his jowl was too massive: when he did not hold his head up to hide it you saw that he had a double chin; and there was something apelike in those bushy, grizzled eyebrows of his that vaguely disgusted her. He was heavy in his movements, and all the care he took in his diet and all his exercise did not prevent him from being fat; his bones were much too well covered and his joints had a middle-aged stiffness. His smart clothes, were a little tight for him and a little too young.

But when he came into the drawing-room before luncheon Kitty received quite a shock (this perhaps was why her pallor had been so marked), for she discovered that her imagination had played an odd trick on her: he did not in the least look as she had pictured him. She could hardly help laughing at herself. His hair was not gray at all, oh, there were a few white hairs on the temple, but they were becoming; and his face was not red, but sunburned; his head was very well placed on his neck; and he wasn't stout and he wasn't old: in fact he was almost slim and his figure was admirable--could you blame him if he was a trifle vain of it?--he might have been a young man. And of course he did know how to wear his clothes; it was absurd to deny that: he looked neat and clean and trim. Whatever could have possessed her to think him this and that? He was a very handsome man. It was lucky that she knew how worthless he was. Of course she had always admitted that his voice had a winning quality, and his voice was exactly as she remembered it: it made the falseness of every word he said more exasperating; its richness of tone and its warmth rang now in her ears with insincerity and she wondered how she could ever have been taken in by it. His eyes were beautiful: that was where his charm lay, they had such a soft, blue brilliance and even when he was talking balderdash an expression which was so delightful; it was almost impossible not to be moved by them.

At last the coffee was brought in and Charlie lit his cheroot. He looked at his watch and rose from the table.

“Well, I must leave you two young women to your own devices. It's time for me to get back to the office.” He paused and then with his friendly, charming eyes on Kitty said to her: “I'm not going to bother you for a day or two till you're rested, but then I want to have a little business talk with you.”

“With me?”

“We must make arrangements about your house, you know, and then there's the furniture.”

“Oh, but I can go to a lawyer. There's no reason why I should bother you about that.”

“Don't think for a moment I'm going to let you waste your money on legal expenses. I'm going to see to everything. You know you're entitled to a pension: I'm going to talk to H.E. about it and see if by making representations in the proper quarter we can't get something extra for you. You put yourself in my hands. But don't bother about anything just yet. All we want you to do now is to get fit and well: isn't that right, Dorothy?”

“Of course.”

He gave Kitty a little nod and then passing by his wife's chair took her hand and kissed it. Most Englishmen look a little foolish when they kiss a woman's hand; he did it with a graceful ease.





74


It was not till Kitty was fairly settled at the Townsends, that she discovered that she was weary. The comfort and the unaccustomed amenity of this life broke up the strain under which she had been living. She had forgotten how pleasant it was to take one's ease, how lulling to be surrounded by pretty things, and how agreeable it was to receive attention. She sank back with a sigh of relief into the facile existence of the luxurious East. It was not displeasing to feel that in a discreet and well-bred fashion she was an object of sympathetic interest. Her bereavement was so recent that it was impossible for entertainments to be given for her, but ladies of consequence in the Colony (His Excellency's wife, the wives of the Admiral and of the Chief Justice) came to drink a quiet cup of tea with her. His Excellency's wife said that His Excellency was most anxious to see her and if she would come very quietly to luncheon at Government House (“not a party of course, only ourselves and the A.D.C.'s!”), it would be very nice. These ladies used Kitty as though she were a piece of porcelain which was as fragile as it was precious. She could not fail to see that they looked upon her as a little heroine, and she had sufficient humor to play the part with modesty and discretion. She wished sometimes that Waddington were there; with his malicious shrewdness he would have seen the fun of the situation; and when alone they might have had a good laugh over it together. Dorothy had had a letter from him, and he had said all manner of things about her devoted work at the convent, about her courage and her self-control. Of course he was skillfully pulling their legs: the dirty dog.





75


Kitty did not know whether it was by chance or by design that she never found herself for a moment alone with Charlie. His tact was exquisite. He remained kindly, sympathetic, pleasant, and amiable. No one could have guessed that they had ever been more than acquaintances. But one afternoon when she was lying on a sofa outside her room reading he passed along the verandah and stopped.

“What is that you're reading?” he asked.

“A book.”

She looked at him with irony. He smiled.

“Dorothy's gone to a garden-party at Government House.”

“I know. Why haven't you gone too?”

“I didn't feel I could face it and I thought I'd come back and keep you company. The car's outside, would you like to come for a drive round the island?”

“No, thank you.”

He sat down on the foot of the sofa on which she lay.

“We haven't had the chance of a talk by ourselves since you got here.”

She looked straight into his eyes with cool insolence.

“Do you think we have anything to say to one another?”

“Volumes.”

She shifted her feet so that she should not touch him.

“Are you still angry with me?” he asked, the shadow of a smile on his lips and his eyes melting.

“Not a bit,” she laughed.

“I don't think you'd laugh if you weren't.”

“You're mistaken; I despise you much too much to be angry with you.”

He was unruffled.

“I think you're rather hard on me. Looking back calmly, don't you honestly think I was right?”

“From your standpoint.”

“Now that you know Dorothy, you must admit she's rather nice?”

“Of course. I shall always be grateful for her great kindness to me.”

“She's one in a thousand. I should never have had a moment's peace if We'd bolted. It would have been a rotten trick to play on her. And after all I had to think of my children; it would have been an awful handicap for them.”

For a minute she held him in her reflective gaze. She felt completely mistress of the situation.

“I've watched you very carefully during the week I've been here. I've come to the conclusion that you really are fond of Dorothy. I should never have thought you capable of it.”

“I told you I was fond of her. I wouldn't do anything to cause her a moment's uneasiness. She's the best wife a man ever had.”

“Have you never thought that you owed her any loyalty?”

“What the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve for,” he smiled.

She shrugged her shoulders.

“You're despicable.”

“I'm human. I don't know why you should think me such a cad because I fell head over ears in love with you. I didn't particularly want to, you know.”

It gave her a little twist of the heart-strings to hear him say that.

“I was fair game,” she answered bitterly.

“Naturally I couldn't foresee that we were going to get into such a devil of a scrape.”

“And in any case you had a pretty shrewd idea that if any one suffered it wouldn't be you.”

“I think that's a bit thick. After all, now it's all over, you must see I acted for the best for both of us. You lost your head and you ought to be jolly glad that I kept mine. Do you think it would have been a success if I'd done what you wanted me to? We were dashed uncomfortable in the frying-pan, but we should have been a damned sight worse off in the fire. And you haven't come to any harm. Why can't we kiss and make friends?”

She almost laughed.

“You can hardly expect me to forget that you sent me to almost certain death without a shadow of compunction?”

“Oh, what nonsense! I told you there was no risk if you took reasonable precautions. Do you think I'd have let you go for a moment if I hadn't been perfectly convinced of that?”

“You were convinced because you wanted to be. You're one of those cowards who only think what it's profitable for them to think.”

“Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You have come back, and if you don't mind my saying anything so objectionable you've come back prettier than ever.”

“And Walter?”

He could not resist the facetious answer which came to his mind. Charlie smiled.

“Nothing suits you so well as black.”

She stared at him for a moment. Tears filled her eyes and she began to cry. Her beautiful face was distorted with grief. She did not seek to hide it, but lay on her back with her hands along her sides.

“For God's sake don't cry like that. I didn't mean to say anything unkind. It was only a joke. You know how sincerely I feel for you in your bereavement.”

“Oh, hold your stupid tongue.”

“I'd give anything to have Walter back again.”

“He died because of you and me.”

He took her hand, but she snatched it away from him.

“Please go away,” she sobbed. “That's the only thing you can do for me now. I hate and despise you. Walter was worth ten of you and I was too big a fool to see it. Go away. Go away.”

She saw he was going to speak again and she sprang to her feet and went into her room. He followed her, and as he entered, with instinctive prudence, drew the shutter so that they were almost in darkness.

“I can't leave you like this,” he said, putting his arms round her.“You know I didn't mean to hurt you.”

“Don't touch me. For God's sake go. Go away.”

She tried to tear herself from him, but he would not let her. She was crying hysterically now.

“Darling, don't you know that I've always loved you,” he said in his deep, charming voice. “I love you more than ever.”

“How can you tell such lies! Let me go. Damn you, let me go.”

“Don't be unkind to me, Kitty. I know I've been a brute to you, but forgive me.”

She was shaking and sobbing, struggling to get away from him, but the pressure of his arms was strangely comforting. She had so longed to feel them round her once more, just once, and all her body trembled. She felt dreadfully weak. It seemed as though her bones were melting, and the sorrow she felt for Walter shifted into pity for herself.

“Oh, how could you be so unkind to me?” she sobbed. “Don't you know that I loved you with all my heart? No one has ever loved you as I loved you.”

“Darling.”

He began to kiss her.

“No, no,” she cried.

He sought her face, but she turned it away; he sought her lips; she did not know what he was saying, broken, passionate words of love; and his arms held her so firmly that she felt like a child that has been lost and now at last is safe at home. She moaned faintly. Her eyes were closed and her face was wet with tears. And then he found her lips and the pressure of his upon them shot through her body like the flame of God. It was an ecstasy and she was burnt to a cinder and she glowed as though she were transfigured. In her dreams, in her dreams she had known this rapture. What was he doing with her now? She did not know. She was not a woman, her personality was dissolved, she was nothing but desire. He lifted her off her feet, she was very light in his arms, he carried her and she clung to him, desperate and adoring; her head sank on the pillow and his lips clung to hers.





76


She sat on the edge of the bed hiding her face with her hands.

“Would you like a drop of water?”

She shook her head. He went over to the washing-stand, filled the tooth-glass and brought it to her.

“Come along, have a little drink and you'll feel better.”

He put the glass to her lips and she sipped the water. Then, with horrified eyes, she stared at him. He was standing over her, looking down, and in his eyes was a twinkle of self-satisfaction.

“Well, do you think I'm such a dirty dog as you did?” he asked.

She looked down.

“Yes. But I know that I'm not a bit better than you. Oh, I'm so ashamed.”

“Well, I think you're very ungrateful.”

“Will you go now?”

“To tell you the truth I think it's about time. I'll just go and tidy up before Dorothy comes in.”

He went out of the room with a jaunty step.

Kitty sat for a while, still on the edge of the bed, hunched up like an imbecile. Her mind was vacant. A shudder passed through her. She staggered to her feet and, going to the dressing-table, sank into a chair. She stared at herself in the glass. Her eyes were swollen with tears; her face was stained and there was a red mark on one cheek where his had rested. She looked at herself with horror. It was the same face. She had expected in it she knew not what change of degradation.

“Swine,” she flung at her reflection. “Swine.”

Then, letting her face fall on her arms, she wept bitterly. Shame, shame! She did not know what had come over her. It was horrible. She hated him and she hated herself. It had been ecstasy. Oh, hateful! She could never look him in the face again. He was so justified. He had been right not to marry her, for she was worthless; she was no better than a harlot. Oh, worse, for those poor women gave themselves for bread. And in this house too into which Dorothy had taken her in her sorrow and cruel desolation! Her shoulders shook with her sobs. Everything was gone now. She had thought herself changed, she had thought herself strong, she thought she had returned to Hong Kong a woman who possessed herself; new ideas flitted about her heart like little yellow butterflies in the sunshine and she had hoped to be so much better in the future; freedom like a spirit of light had beckoned her on, and the world was like a spacious plain through which she could walk light of foot and with head erect. She had thought herself free from lust and vile passions, free to live the clean and healthy life of the spirit; she had likened herself to the white egrets that fly with leisurely flight across the rice-fields at dusk and they are like the soaring thoughts of a mind at rest with itself; and she was a slave. Weak, weak! It was hopeless, it was no good to try, she was a slut.

She would not go in to dinner. She sent the boy to tell Dorothy that she had a headache and preferred to remain in her room. Dorothy came in and, seeing her red, swollen eyes, talked for a little in her gentle, commiserating way of trivial things. Kitty knew that Dorothy thought she had been crying on account of Walter and, sympathizing like the good and loving wife she was, respected the natural sorrow.

“I know it's very hard, dear,” she said as she left Kitty. “But you must try to have courage. I'm sure your dear husband wouldn't wish you to grieve for him.”

But next morning Kitty rose early and leaving a note for Dorothy to say that she was gone out on business took a tram down the hill. She made her way through the crowded streets with their motor-cars, rickshaws and chairs, and the motley throng of Europeans and Chinese, to the offices of the P. & O. Company. A ship was sailing in two days, the first ship out of the port, and she had made up her mind that at all costs she must go on it. When the clerk told her that every berth was booked she asked to see the chief agent. She sent in her name and the agent, whom she had met before, came out to fetch her into his office. He knew her circumstances and when she told him what she wished he sent for the passenger list. He looked at it with perplexity.

“I beseech you to do what you can for me,” she urged him.

“I don't think there's any one in the Colony who wouldn't do anything in the world for you, Mrs. Fane,” he answered.

He sent for a clerk and made enquiries. Then he nodded.

“I'm going to shift one or two people. I know you want to get home and I think we ought to do our best for you. I can give you a little cabin to yourself. I expect you'd prefer that.”

She thanked him. She left him with an elated heart. Flight: that was her only thought. Flight! She sent a cable to her father to announce her immediate return; she had already cabled to him to say that Walter was dead; and then went back to the Townsends' to tell Dorothy what she had done.

“We shall be dreadfully sorry to lose you,” the kind creature said, “but of course I understand that you want to be with your mother and father.”

Since her return to Hong Kong Kitty had hesitated from day to day to go to her house. She dreaded entering it again and meeting face to face the recollections with which it was peopled. But now she had no alternative. Townsend had arranged for the sale of the furniture and he had found some one eager to take on the lease, but there were all her clothes and Walter's, for they had taken next to nothing to Mei-tan-fu, and there were books, photographs, and various odds and ends. Kitty, indifferent to everything and anxious to cut herself off completely from the past, realized that it would outrage the susceptibilities of the Colony if she allowed these things to go with the rest to an auction-room. They must be packed and sent to her. So after tiffin she prepared to go to the house. Dorothy, eager to give her help, offered to accompany her, but Kitty begged to be allowed to go alone. She agreed that two of Dorothy's boys should come and assist in the packing.

The house had been left in charge of the head boy and he opened the door for Kitty. It was curious to go into her own house as though she were a stranger. It was neat and clean. Everything was in its place, ready for her use, but although the day was warm and sunny there was about the silent rooms a chill and desolate air. The furniture was stiffly arranged, exactly where it should be, and the vases which should have held flowers were in their places; the book which Kitty had laid face downwards she did not remember when still lay face downwards. It was as though the house had been left empty but a minute before and yet that minute was fraught with eternity so that you could not imagine that ever again that house would echo with talk and resound with laughter. On the piano the open music of a foxtrot seemed to wait to be played, but you had a feeling that if you struck the keys no sound would come. Walter's room was as tidy as when he was there. On the chest of drawers were two large photographs of Kitty, one in her presentation dress and one in her wedding gown.

But the boys fetched up the trunks from the box-room and she stood over them watching them pack. They packed neatly and quickly. Kitty reflected that in the two days she had it would be easy to get everything done. She must not let herself think; she had no time for that. Suddenly she heard a step behind her and turning round saw Charles Townsend. She felt a sudden chill at her heart.

“What do you want?” she said.

“Will you come into your sitting-room? I have something to say to you.”

“I'm very busy.”

“I shall only keep you five minutes.”

She said no more, but with a word to the boys to go on with what they were doing, preceded Charles into the next room. She did not sit down, in order to show him that she expected him not to detain her. She knew that she was very pale and her heart was beating fast, but she faced him coolly, with hostile eyes.

“What is it you want?”

“I've just heard from Dorothy that you're going the day after tomorrow. She told me that you'd come here to do your packing and she asked me to ring up and find out if there was anything I could do for you.”

“I'm grateful to you, but I can manage quite well by myself.”

“So I imagined. I didn't come here to ask you that. I came to ask if your sudden departure is due to what happened yesterday.”

“You and Dorothy have been very good to me. I didn't wish you to think I was taking advantage of your good nature.”

“That's not a very straight answer.”

“What does it matter to you?”

“It matters a great deal. I shouldn't like to think that anything I'd done had driven you away.”

She was standing at the table. She looked down. Her eyes fell on the Sketch. It was months old now. It was that paper which Walter had stared at all through the terrible evening when--and Walter now was… She raised her eyes.

“I feel absolutely degraded. You can't possibly despise me as much as I despise myself.”

“But I don't despise you. I meant every word that I said yesterday. What's the good of running away like this? I don't know why we can't be good friends. I hate the idea of your thinking I've treated you badly.”

“Why couldn't you leave me alone?”

“Hang it all, I'm not a stick or a stone. It's so unreasonable, the way you look at it; it's so morbid. I thought after yesterday you'd feel a little more kindly to me. After all, we're only human.”

“I don't feel human. I feel like an animal. A pig or a rabbit or a dog. Oh, I don't blame you, I was just as bad. I yielded to you because I wanted you. But it wasn't the real me. I'm not that hateful, beastly, lustful woman. I disown her. It wasn't me that lay on that bed panting for you when my husband was hardly cold in his grave and your wife had been so kind to me, so indescribably kind. It was only the animal in me, dark and fearful like an evil spirit, and I disown, and hate, and despise it. And ever since, when I've thought of it, my gorge rises and I feel that I must vomit.”

He frowned a little and gave a short, uneasy snigger.

“Well, I'm fairly broadminded, but sometimes you say things that positively shock me.”

“I should be sorry to do that. You'd better go now. You're a very unimportant little man and I'm silly to talk to you seriously.”

He did not answer for a while and she saw by the shadow in his blue eyes that he was angry with her. He would heave a sigh of relief when, tactful and courteous as ever, he had finally seen her off. It amused her to think of the politeness with which, while they shook hands and he wished her a pleasant journey, she would thank him for his hospitality. But she saw his expression change.

“Dorothy tells me you're going to have a baby,” he said.

She felt herself color, but she allowed no gesture to escape her.

“I am.”

“Am I by any chance the father?”

“No, no. It's Walter's child.”

She spoke with an emphasis which she could not prevent, but even as she spoke she knew that it was not the tone with which to carry conviction.

“Are you sure?” He was now roguishly smiling. “After all, you were married to Walter a couple of years and nothing happened. The dates seem to fit all right. I think it's much more likely to be mine than Walter's.”

“I would rather kill myself than have a child of yours.”

“Oh, come now, that's nonsense. I should be awfully pleased and proud. I'd like it to be a girl, you know. I've only had boys with Dorothy. You won't be able to be in doubt very long, you know: my three kiddies are absolutely the living image of me.”

He had regained his good humor and she knew why. If the child was his, though she might never see him again, she could never entirely escape him. His power over her would reach out and he would still, obscurely but definitely, influence every day of her life.

“You really are the most vain and fatuous ass that it's ever been my bad luck to run across,” she said.

As the ship steamed into Marseilles, Kitty, looking at the rugged and beautiful outline of the coast glowing in the sunlight, on a sudden caught sight of the golden statue of the Blessed Virgin which stands upon the church of Sainte Marie de la Grace as a symbol of safety to the mariner at sea. She remembered how the Sisters of the convent at Mei-tan-fu, leaving their own land for ever, had knelt as the figure faded in the distance so that it was no more than a little golden flame in the blue sky and sought in prayer to allay the pang of separation. She clasped her hands in supplication to what power she knew not.

During the long, quiet journey she had thought incessantly of the horrible thing that had happened to her. She could not understand herself. It was so unexpected. What was it that had seized her, so that, despising him, despising him with all her heart, she had yielded passionately to Charlie's foul embrace? Rage filled her and disgust of herself obsessed her. She felt that she could never forget her humiliation. She wept. But as the distance from Hong Kong increased she found that she was insensibly losing the vividness of her resentment. What had happened seemed to have happened in another world. She was like a person who has been stricken with sudden madness and recovering is distressed and ashamed at the grotesque things he vaguely remembers to have done when he was not himself. But because he knows he was not himself he feels that in his own eyes at least he can claim indulgence. Kitty thought that perhaps a generous heart might pity rather than condemn her. But she sighed as she thought how woefully her self-confidence had been shattered. The way had seemed to stretch before her straight and easy and now she saw that it was a tortuous way and that pitfalls awaited her. The vast spaces and the tragic and beautiful sunsets of the Indian Ocean rested her. She seemed borne then to some country where she might in freedom possess her soul. If she could only regain her self-respect at the cost of a bitter conflict, well, she must find the courage to affront it.

The future was lonely and difficult. At Port Said she had received a letter from her mother in answer to her cable. It was a long letter written in the large and fanciful writing which was taught to young ladies in her mother's youth. Its ornateness was so neat that it gave you an impression of insincerity. Mrs. Garstin expressed her regret at Walter's death and sympathised properly with her daughter's grief. She feared that Kitty was left inadequately provided for, but naturally the Colonial Office would give her a pension. She was glad to know that Kitty was coming back to England and of course she must come and stay with her father and mother till her child was born. Then followed certain instructions that Kitty must be sure to follow and various details of her sister Doris's confinement. The little boy weighed so and so much and his paternal grandfather said he had never seen a finer child. Doris was expecting again and they hoped for another boy in order to make the succession to the baronetcy quite sure.

Kitty saw that the point of the letter lay in the definite date set for the invitation. Mrs. Garstin had no intention of being saddled with a widowed daughter in modest circumstances. It was singular, when she reflected how her mother had idolized her, that now, disappointed in her, she found her merely a nuisance. How strange was the relation between parents and children! When they were small the parents doted on them, passed through agonies of apprehension at each childish ailment, and the children clung to their parents with love and adoration; a few years passed, the children grew up, and persons not of their kin were more important to their happiness than father or mother. Indifference displaced the blind and instinctive love of the past. Their meetings were a source of boredom and irritation. Distracted once at the thought of a month's separation they were able now to look forward with equanimity to being parted for years. Her mother need not worry: as soon as she could she would make herself a home of her own. But she must have a little time; at present everything was vague and she could not form any picture of the future: perhaps she would die in childbirth; that would be a solution of many difficulties.

But when they docked two letters were handed to her. She was surprised to recognize her father's writing: she did not remember that he had ever written to her. He was not effusive, and began: Dear Kitty. He told her that he was writing instead of her mother who had not been well and was obliged to go into a nursing home to have an operation. Kitty was not to be frightened and was to keep to her intention of going round by sea; it was much more expensive to come across by land and with her mother away it would be inconvenient for Kitty to stay at the house in Harrington Gardens. The other was from Doris and it started: Kitty darling, not because Doris had any particular affection for her, but because it was her way thus to address everyone she knew.





Kitty darling

I expect Father has written to you. Mother has got to have an operation. It appears that she has been rotten for the last year, but you know she hates doctors and she's been taking all sorts of patent medicines. I don't quite know what's the matter with her as she insists on making a secret of the whole thing and flies into a passion if you ask her questions. She has been looking simply awful and if I were you I think I'd get off at Marseilles and come back as quick as you can. But don't let on that I told you to come as she pretends there's nothing much the matter with her and she doesn't want you to get here till she's back at home. She's made the doctors promise that she shall be moved in a week. Best love.

DORIS





I'm awfully sorry about Walter. You must have had a hell of a time, poor darling. I'm simply dying to see you. It's rather funny our both having babies together. We shall be able to hold one another's hands.





Kitty, lost in reflection, stood for a little while on the deck. She could not imagine her mother ill. She never remembered to have seen her other than active and resolute; she had always been impatient of other people's ailments. Then a steward came up to her with a telegram.





Deeply regret to inform you that your mother died this morning. Father.

Kitty rang the bell at the house in Harrington Gardens. She was told that her father was in his study and going to the door she opened it softly: he was sitting by the fire reading the last edition of the evening paper. He looked up as she entered, put down the paper, and sprang nervously to his feet.

“Oh, Kitty, I didn't expect you till the later train.”

“I thought you wouldn't want the bother of coming to meet me so I didn't wire the time I expected to arrive.”

He gave her his cheek to kiss in the manner she so well remembered.

“I was just having a look at the paper,” he said. “I haven't read the paper for the last two days.”

She saw that he thought it needed some explanation if he occupied himself with the ordinary affairs of life.

“Of course,” she said. “You must be tired out, I'm afraid mother's death has been a great shock to you.”

He was older and thinner than when she had last seen him. A little, lined, dried-up man, with a precise manner.

“The surgeon said there had never been any hope. She hadn't been herself for more than a year, but she refused to see a doctor. The surgeon told me that she must have been in constant pain, he said it was a miracle that she had been able to endure it.”

“Did she never complain?”

“She said she wasn't very well. But she never complained of pain.” He paused and looked at Kitty. “Are you very tired after your journey?”

“Not very.”

“Would you like to go up and see her?”

“Is she here?”

“Yes, she was brought here from the nursing home.”

“Yes, I'll go now.”

“Would you like me to come with you?

There was something in her father's tone that made her look at him quickly. His face was slightly turned from her; he did not want her to catch his eye. Kitty had acquired of late a singular proficiency at reading the thoughts of others. After all, day after day she had applied all her sensibilities to divine from a casual word or an unguarded gesture the hidden thoughts of her husband. She guessed at once what her father was trying to hide from her. It was relief he felt, an infinite relief, and he was frightened of himself. For hard on thirty years he had been a good and faithful husband, he had never uttered a single word in dispraise of his wife, and now he should grieve for her. He had always done the things that were expected of him. It would have been shocking to him by the flicker of an eyelid or by the smallest hint to betray that he did not feel what under the circumstances a bereaved husband should feel.

“No, I would rather go by myself,” said Kitty.

She went upstairs and into the large, cold and pretentious bedroom in which her mother for so many years had slept. She remembered so well those massive pieces of mahogany and the engravings after Marcus Stone which adorned the walls. The things on the dressing-table were arranged with the stiff precision which Mrs. Garstin had all her life insisted upon. The flowers looked out of place; Mrs. Garstin would have thought it silly, affected, and unhealthy to have flowers in her bedroom. Their perfume did not cover that acrid, musty smell, as of freshly washed linen, which Kitty remembered as characteristic of her mother's room.

Mrs. Garstin lay on the bed, her hands folded across her breasts with a meekness which in life she would have had no patience with. With her strong sharp features, the cheeks hollow with suffering and the temples sunken, she looked handsome and even imposing. Death had robbed her face of its meanness and left only an impression of character. She might have been a Roman empress. It was strange to Kitty that of the dead persons she had seen this was the only one who in death seemed to preserve a look as though that clay had been once a habitation of the spirit. Grief she could not feel, for there had been too much bitterness between her mother and herself to leave in her heart any deep feeling of affection; and looking back on the girl she had been she knew that it was her mother who had made her what she was. But when she looked at that hard, domineering and ambitious woman who lay there so still and silent with all her petty aims frustrated by death, she was aware of a vague pathos. She had schemed and intrigued all her life and never had she desired anything but what was base and unworthy. Kitty wondered whether perhaps in some other sphere she looked upon her earthly course with consternation.

Doris came in.

“I thought you'd come by this train. I felt I must look in for a moment. Isn't it dreadful? Poor darling mother.”

Bursting into tears, she flung herself into Kitty's arms. Kitty kissed her. She knew how her mother had neglected Doris in favor of her and how harsh she had been with her because she was plain and dull. She wondered whether Doris really felt the extravagant grief she showed. But Doris had always been emotional. She wished she could cry: Doris would think her dreadfully hard. Kitty felt that she had been through too much to feign a distress she did not feel.

“Would you like to come and see father?” she asked her when the strength of the outburst had somewhat subsided.

Doris wiped her eyes. Kitty noticed that her sister's pregnancy had blunted her features and in her black dress she looked gross and blousy.

“No, I don't think I will. I shall only cry again. Poor old thing, he's bearing it wonderfully.”

Kitty showed her sister out of the house and then went back to her father. He was standing in front of the fire and the newspaper was neatly folded. He wanted her to see that he had not been reading it again.

“I haven't dressed for dinner,” he said. “I didn't think it was necessary.”





80


They dined. Mr. Garstin gave Kitty the details of his wife's illness and death, and he told her of the kindness of the friends who had written (there were piles of sympathetic letters on his table and he sighed when he considered the burden of answering them) and of the arrangements he had made for the funeral. Then they went back into his study. This was the only room in the house which had a fire. He mechanically took from the chimney-piece his pipe and began to fill it, but he gave his daughter a doubtful look and put it down.

“Aren't you going to smoke?” she asked.

“Your mother didn't very much like the smell of a pipe after dinner and since the war I've given up cigars.”

His answer gave Kitty a little pang. It seemed dreadful that a man of sixty should hesitate to smoke what he wanted in his own study.

“I like the smell of a pipe,” she smiled.

A faint look of relief crossed his face and taking his pipe once more he lit it. They sat opposite one another on each side of the fire. He felt that he must talk to Kitty of her own troubles.

“You received the letter your mother wrote to you to Port Said, I suppose. The news of poor Walter's death was a great shock to both of us. I thought him a very nice fellow.”

Kitty did not know what to say.

“Your mother told me that you were going to have a baby.”

“Yes.”

“When do you expect it?”

“In about four months.”

“It will be a great consolation to you. You must go and see Doris's boy. He's a fine little fellow.”

They were talking more distantly than if they were strangers who had just met, for if they had been he would have been interested in her just because of that, and curious, but their common past was a wall of indifference between them. Kitty knew too well that she had done nothing to beget her father's affection, he had never counted in the house and had been taken for granted, the bread-winner who was a little despised because he could provide no more luxuriously for his family; but she had taken for granted that he loved her just because he was her father, and it was a shock to discover that his heart was empty of feeling for her. She had known that they were all bored by him, but it had never occurred to her that he was equally bored by them. He was as ever kind and subdued, but the sad perspicacity which she had learnt in suffering suggested to her that, though he had probably never acknowledged it to himself and never would, in his heart he disliked her.

His pipe was not drawing and he rose to find something to poke it with. Perhaps it was an excuse to hide his nervousness.

“Your mother wished you to stay here till your baby was born and she was going to have your old room got ready for you.”

“I know. I promise you I won't be a bother.”

“Oh, it's not that. Under the circumstances it was evident that the only place for you to come to was your father's house. But the fact is that I've just been offered the post of Chief Justice of the Bahamas and I have accepted it.”

“Oh, father, I'm so glad. I congratulate you with all my heart.”

“The offer arrived too late for me to tell your poor mother. It would have given her a great satisfaction.”

The bitter irony of fate! After all her efforts, intrigues, and humiliations, Mrs. Garstin had died without knowing that her ambition, however modified by past disappointments, was at last achieved.

“I am sailing early next month. Of course this house will be put in the agent's hands and my intention was to sell the furniture. I'm sorry that I shan't be able to have you to stay here, but if you'd like any of the furniture to furnish a flat I shall be extremely pleased to give it to you.”

Kitty looked into the fire. Her heart beat quickly; it was curious that on a sudden she should be so nervous. But at last she forced herself to speak. In her voice was a little tremor.

“Couldn't I come with you, father?”

“You? Oh, my dear Kitty.” His face fell. She had often heard the expression, but thought it only a phrase, and now for the first time in her life she saw the movement that it described. It was so marked that it startled her. “But all your friends are here and Doris is here. I should have thought you'd be much happier if you took a flat in London. I don't exactly know what your circumstances are, but I shall be very glad to pay the rent of it.”

“I have enough money to live on.”

“I'm going to a strange place. I know nothing of the conditions.”

“I'm used to strange places. London means nothing to me any more. I couldn't breathe here.”

He closed his eyes for a moment and she thought he was going to cry. His face bore an expression of utter misery. It wrung her heart. She had been right; the death of his wife had filled him with relief and now this chance to break entirely with the past had offered him freedom. He had seen a new life spread before him and at last after all these years rest and the mirage of happiness. She saw dimly all the suffering that had preyed on his heart for thirty years. At last he opened his eyes. He could not prevent the sigh that escaped him.

“Of course if you wish to come I shall be very pleased.”

It was pitiful. The struggle had been short and he had surrendered to his sense of duty. With those few words he abandoned all his hopes. She rose from her chair and going over to him knelt down and seized his hands.

“No, father, I won't come unless you want me. You've sacrificed yourself enough. If you want to go alone, go. Don't think of me for a minute.”

He released one of her hands and stroked her pretty hair.

“Of course I want you, my dear. After all I'm your father and you're a widow and alone. If you want to be with me it would be very unkind of me not to want you.”

“But that's just it, I make no claims on you because I'm your daughter, you owe me nothing.”

“Oh, my dear child.”

“Nothing,” she repeated vehemently. “My heart sinks when I think how we've battened on you all our lives and have given you nothing in return. Not even a little affection. I'm afraid you've not had a very happy life. Won't you let me try to make up a little for all I've failed to do in the past?”

He frowned a little. Her emotion embarrassed him.

“I don't know what you mean. I've never had any complaint to make of you.”

“Oh, father, I've been through so much, I've been so unhappy. I'm not the Kitty I was when I went away. I'm terribly weak, but I don't think I'm the filthy cad I was then. Won't you give me a chance? I have nobody but you in the world now. Won't you let me try to make you love me? Oh, father, I'm so lonely and so miserable; I want your love so badly.”

She buried her face in his lap and cried as though her heart were breaking.

“Oh, my Kitty, my little Kitty,” he murmured.

She looked up and put her arms round his neck.

“Oh, father, be kind to me. Let us be kind to one another.”

He kissed her, on the lips, as a lover might, and his cheeks were wet with her tears.

“Of course you shall come with me.”

“Do you want me to? Do you really want me to?”

“Yes.”

“I'm so grateful to you.”

“Oh, my dear, don't say things like that to me. It makes me feel quite awkward.”

He took out his handkerchief and dried her eyes. He smiled in a way that she had never seen him smile before. Once more she threw her arms round his neck.

“We'll have such a lark, father dear. You don't know what fun we're going to have together.”

“You haven't forgotten that you're going to have a baby.”

“I'm glad she'll be born out there within sound of the sea and under a wide blue sky.”

“Have you already made up your mind about the sex?” he murmured, with his thin, dry smile.

“I want a girl because I want to bring her up so that she shan't make the mistakes I've made. When I look back upon the girl I was I hate myself. But I never had a chance. I'm going to bring up my daughter so that she's free and can stand on her own feet. I'm not going to bring a child into the world, and love her, and bring her up, just so that some man may want to sleep with her so much that he's willing to provide her with board and lodging for the rest of her life.”

She felt her father stiffen. He had never spoken of such things and it shocked him to hear these words in his daughter's mouth.

“Let me be frank just this once, father. I've been foolish and wicked and hateful. I've been terribly punished. I'm determined to save my daughter from all that. I want her to be fearless and frank. I want her to be a person, independent of others because she is possessed of herself, and I want her to take life like a free man and make a better job of it than I have.”

“Why, my love, you talk as though you were fifty. You've got all your life before you. You mustn't be down-hearted.”

Kitty shook her head and slowly smiled.

“I'm not. I have hope and courage.”

The past was finished; let the dead bury their dead. Was that dreadfully callous? She hoped with all her heart that she had learnt compassion and charity. She could not know what the future had in store for her, but she felt in herself the strength to accept whatever was to come with a light and buoyant spirit. Then, on a sudden, for no reason that she knew of, from the depths of her unconscious arose a reminiscence of the journey they had taken, she and poor Walter, to the plague-ridden city where he had met his death: one morning they set out in their chairs while it was still dark, and as the day broke she divined rather than saw a scene of such breath-taking loveliness that for a brief period the anguish of her heart was assuaged. It reduced to insignificance all human tribulation. The sun rose, dispelling the mist, and she saw winding onwards as far as the eye could reach, among the rice-fields, across a little river and through undulating country the path they were to follow: perhaps her faults and follies, the unhappiness she had suffered, were not entirely vain if she could follow the path that now she dimly discerned before her, not the path that kind funny old Waddington had spoken of that led nowhither, but the path those dear nuns at the convent followed so humbly, the path that led to peace.
