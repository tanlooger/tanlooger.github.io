黑骏马



序言


《黑骏马》是英国著名作家安娜·塞维尔（Anna Sewell，1820—1878）于1871至1877年间历尽艰辛创作的唯一的一本书，是轰动欧洲文坛的经典儿童小说，被誉为“第一部真正的动物小说”。

安娜·塞维尔出生于英格兰诺福克郡的大雅茅斯，她的母亲玛丽·怀特·塞维尔是著名的儿童文学家。安娜·塞维尔十四岁那年摔伤了脚踝，之后外出时经常乘坐马车，这使她渐渐地对马产生了深切的怜悯之情，并开始关注人类对待动物的行为。

《黑骏马》通过一匹马的自传，借由马的眼睛来观察人类社会，开拓了文学创作的新领域。黑骏马温顺聪明，身强力壮，皮毛乌黑亮泽，前额上的一点儿白色皮毛仿佛一颗美丽的白星。然而，命途多舛，变化无常，作为一匹马，他饱经沧桑，尝尽了人间的冷暖辛酸。黑骏马一生中不停地变换主人，他没有为此而失望，也没有堕落，而是坚强地活着。其实，黑骏马的一生是维多利亚时期各种马的命运的缩影。在黑骏马身上，我们可以看到人类的好多优秀品质——诚实可靠、坚定勇敢、温顺友善。虽然黑骏马历经磨难，却始终没有改变这些品质。正如英国诗人拜伦所说：“你拥有人类的全部美德，却毫无人类的缺陷。”

本书以黑骏马的视角，用栩栩如生、惟妙惟肖的语言，讲述了一个个娓娓动听、感人至深的精彩故事。作者的用意就是要告诉世人：动物有感情，也有思想，人类应该善待动物，关爱生活在大自然中的每一条生命。

第一章　最初的家


我能清晰记起的第一个地方是一片宜人的大牧场，其中有一个清澈见底的池塘。绿树成荫，倾身向池，灯心草和睡莲扎根泽中。越过树篱一边，我们可以看到一块耕地，而另一边能望见主人家的大门，主人家就在路边上。牧场的高处有一小片杉树林，低处有一条潺潺流动的小溪，陡峭的河岸悬于小溪之上。

年幼时，我不会吃草，就靠妈妈哺乳。白天我在她身边撒欢，晚上紧偎着她躺着。天热时，我们常常站在池边的树荫下；天冷时，我们就待在树林附近一个温暖舒适的马棚里。

当我长到可以吃草时，妈妈便开始了早出晚归的劳作。

除我以外，牧场上还有六匹马驹。他们都比我年龄大，有些都快有成年马那样高了。我常常跟他们一起奔跑，真好玩儿。我们也经常一起绕着牧场一圈一圈地尽力飞奔。有时我们玩得相当粗野，因为他们疾驰时经常连踢带咬。

一天，我们踢得正欢时，妈妈轻声把我叫到跟前，说道：

“我希望你用心听我要对你说的话。住在这儿的都是很好的马驹，但他们是要去拉货车的马驹，当然他们没有学会礼仪。而你有教养，出身名门。你的爸爸在这一带赫赫有名，你的爷爷在纽马克特赛马比赛中连续两年夺冠，你的奶奶拥有我认识的马匹中最驯良的性格，我想你也从来没有见过我踢咬。我希望你温和善良，永不学坏；用心工作，小跑时蹄子轻抬轻落，即使是在游戏中，也绝不要踢咬。”

我从来没有忘记过妈妈的忠告。我知道她是一匹明理的老马，我家主人非常看重她。妈妈名叫公爵夫人，但是主人常常叫她宝贝儿。

我们的主人是一个善良和蔼的人，他给我们好吃的，给我们提供好的住所，说话也好声好气的，他对我们说话就像跟自家小孩儿说话那样温柔。我们都喜欢他，我的妈妈非常爱他。妈妈在大门边一看到他，就会欢叫，一路小跑到他的身边。主人会轻拍轻抚着她说：“噢，老宝贝儿，你家的小黑怎么样？”因为我毛色黯黑，所以他叫我小黑。随后，他就会给我一片好吃的面包，有时也会给妈妈带一根胡萝卜。所有的马儿都会到他的身边来，但我认为我和妈妈才是他的最爱。赶集那天，妈妈总是独自拉着轻便马车送主人到镇上去。

有一个耕童，名叫迪克，他有时会翻过树篱到我们的田地里摘黑莓。吃饱后，他还要向马驹们扔石子和树枝，让他们飞奔，说是拿马驹们逗乐。我们对他不大介意，因为我们可以跑开，但有时石子会击中并砸伤我们。

一天，他又玩起了这种把戏，不知道主人就在旁边的牧场上；主人就在那儿，瞧了个正着。他立马翻过栅栏，抓住迪克的胳膊，扇了他一耳光，迪克疼得嗷嗷惊叫起来。我们一看见主人，就小跑着靠近些，好看个究竟。

“坏小子！”他说，“坏小子！竟敢撵我的马。这不是第一次，也不是第二次，而是最后一次！给——拿上你的钱滚回家去，我的农场不再需要你了。”于是，我们再也没有见过迪克。负责照料我们的马夫老丹尼尔像我们的主人一样和善，所以我们过得不错。





第二章　一次捕猎


我两岁前，发生了一件我永远难忘的事儿。那是早春时节，夜里下了一点儿霜，树林和牧场上仍然薄雾笼罩。我和其他几匹马驹正在牧场的低洼处吃草，突然从很远的地方传来了狗叫似的声音。那匹最年长的马驹抬起头来，竖起耳朵，一边说：“有猎犬！”一边立刻小跑了起来；我们其他马驹跟着他跑到了牧场的高地，从那儿可以眺望树篱，望见那边的好几块田地。我的妈妈和主人的一匹老坐骑也站在附近，好像他们对这一切都了如指掌。

“他们发现了一只野兔。”妈妈说，“如果他们从这个方向过来，我们就会看到这次捕猎。”

不久，猎狗们全都俯冲进了我们旁边的那块麦苗地。他们发出的那种声音我从来没有听过。他们不吠，不吼，也不哀嚎，而是用最大的嗓门不断地发出“哟！哟嗷嗷！哟！哟嗷嗷！”的声音。一些人骑马尾随他们而来，有的穿着绿大衣，都全速奔跑着。那匹老马喷着鼻息热切地望着那些人的背影，而我们这些小马驹都渴望跟他们一起飞奔而去，但是很快他们就跑进了田地的低洼处，这时他们好像停住了。猎狗也不叫了，一个个鼻子贴地，四散跑开。

“他们闻不到气味了，”那匹老马说，“说不定那只野兔会脱身。”

“什么野兔？”我问。

“噢！我不知道是什么野兔，很可能是从我们的林地里跑出来的本地野兔。任何野兔只要被那些人和狗发现，都肯定会被追赶。”不久，那些狗又开始“哟！哟嗷嗷！”地叫起来，他们都全速折回，径直奔向我们牧场那个陡峭河岸与树篱夹抱的小溪。

“现在我们要看见那只野兔了。”妈妈说。就在这时，一只惊慌失措的野兔飞蹿而过，逃向树林。猎狗们紧随其后，冲过溪岸，跃过小溪，气势汹汹地穿过田间，猎人们紧追不舍。七八个人纵马跃过小溪，紧跟着那些猎狗。那只野兔试图穿过树篱，但是树篱太密了。于是，她急转弯想夺路而逃，却为时已晚。猎狗狂叫着扑向她。我们只听到一声尖叫，她就一命呜呼了。一位猎人策马上前，扬鞭赶走猎犬，不然猎犬们不一会儿就能把兔子撕成碎片。他拎着那只被撕裂后血流不止的兔腿，把兔子举起来，所有的先生们似乎都心满意足。

对我来说，这突如其来的一幕惊心动魄，我最初都没有注意到小溪边发生的一切；而当我真的转头望去时，那儿却已是一幅惨景。两匹上等好马摔倒，一匹在溪流中挣扎，另一匹在草地上痛苦呻吟。一个骑手正从水里爬起来，浑身是泥；另一个骑手躺在那儿，一动不动。

“他的脖子断了。”妈妈说。

“他也是罪有应得。”其中一匹马驹说。

我也这样想，但是妈妈不同意我们的看法。

“噢，不。”她说，“你们不能那样说。不过，尽管我是一匹老马，见多识广，但是我至今都不理解为什么人们如此喜欢这个活动。他们不但常常伤到自己，还常常毁掉好多好马，糟蹋田地，而这一切仅仅是为了捕获一只兔子、一只狐狸或一头雄鹿，这些本可以用别的方法更轻易地得到。而我们只是马儿，不明白。”

妈妈这样说时，我们站在那儿观看。好多骑手都已经走到了那个年轻人的身边，目睹这一切的我们的主人第一个把他抱了起来。他的头耷拉着，胳膊下垂，大家看上去都很严肃。此刻没有嘈杂声，就连猎犬们也安静了下来，好像知道出事了。人们把他抬进我们主人的家。随后，我听说他是小乔治·戈登，是当地乡绅的独子，是一个高大英俊的小伙子，也是他们家的骄傲。

于是，就有人骑马分头行动，有的去请医生，有的去请马医，肯定还有人去戈登先生家，把他儿子出事的消息告诉他。马医邦德先生来看那匹躺在草地上痛苦呻吟的黑马，把他浑身上下摸了个遍，摇了摇头。马的一条腿断了。随后，有人跑到主人家拿回来一杆枪。不一会儿就传来了一声刺耳的枪响和一声可怕的尖叫，之后万籁俱寂。那匹黑马不再动弹了。

妈妈好像神色不安，她说她认识那匹马好多年了，他的名字叫罗布·罗伊。他是一匹良马，身上没有任何恶习。之后，妈妈再也不愿去那片土地了。

没过多少天，我们听到教堂的钟声长鸣。越过大门，我们看到一辆奇怪的黑色四轮大马车，覆盖着黑布，由几匹黑马拉着，后面跟着一辆一辆又一辆的马车，全是黑色的，钟声不停地鸣响着。人们将小戈登送往墓地安葬。他再也不能骑马了。他们是怎么安置罗布·罗伊的，我无从知道，但是这一切仅仅是为了捕获一只小野兔。





第三章　开始受驯


我现在开始渐渐英俊起来了，皮毛优质柔软，乌黑亮泽。我有一只白蹄，前额上还有一颗漂亮的白星。我被公认为骏马。我四岁前，主人不会卖掉我。他说小男孩不用像成年男子那样干活，小马驹长大前也不必像成年马那样干活。

我四岁那年，戈登先生来看我。他仔细查看了我的眼睛、嘴和腿。他从上到下把我摸了一遍。然后，我得在他面前行走、慢跑和飞奔。他似乎很喜欢我，他说：“这匹马好好训练，一定会很棒。”我的主人说他会亲自训练我，因为他不希望我受到惊吓或伤害。他一刻也没有耽误，因为第二天他就开始训练我了。

大家可能不知道什么是训练，所以我要描述一下。训练就是要教一匹马学会戴马鞍，戴笼头，驮男人、女人或小孩；要按照人们的意愿行走，而且要安分行走。除此以外，马儿还得学会戴马轭、牵鞍兜带和臀带，还要在上这些装备时保持不动，然后再在他们身后套一辆大车或轻便马车，这样无论是行走还是慢跑他们都会拉动后面的马车。还有，马儿必须学会按照车夫的意愿或快或慢，绝不能被看见的什么东西惊动，也不能跟其他马儿说话，不能咬，不能踢，也不能有自己的任何意愿，而是要始终按照主人的意愿做事，哪怕他又累又饿。而最糟糕的是，一旦上了马具，他们既不能在高兴时跳跃，也不能在疲倦时躺下。所以，你明白，训练是一件大事。

当然，我过了很久才习惯戴笼头和缰绳，习惯被人牵着在田野或小路上安分地遛弯儿，但是现在我得咬着马嚼子和缰绳。我的主人像往常一样给我一些燕麦，哄了我好一阵子之后，把嚼子放进我的嘴里，套牢缰绳，但这是件让人讨厌的事儿！如果从来没有咬过嚼子，就无法想象那是多么糟糕的感觉。一大块又冷又硬的铁条，像人的手指那样粗，塞进你的嘴里，放在牙齿间，压在舌头上，两头从嘴角出来，由你的头顶上、喉咙边、鼻子旁、下巴上的皮带紧紧扎住，这样你就无法摆脱这个讨厌的硬东西了。这糟糕极了！是的，糟糕极了！至少我这样认为，但是我知道我的妈妈外出时都戴着，所有的成年马也都戴着。所以，考虑到好吃的燕麦，考虑到主人对我的轻轻拍抚、和声细语和优雅举止，我戴上了嚼子和缰绳。

接下来是马鞍，但是这还没有之前那些事儿的一半糟糕。老丹尼尔托住我的头，我的主人非常温柔地把马鞍放在我的背上。随后，主人系紧我身下的肚带，一直轻轻地拍着我，跟我说话，接着喂我吃了一些麦片，牵着我遛了一小会儿。他每天都这样做，直到我主动要求吃燕麦、套马鞍。一天早晨，主人终于骑到了我的背上，在牧场柔软的绿草上遛了一圈。当然，那感觉的确挺怪，但是我必须得说，能驮着主人，我感到相当自豪。他坚持每天都骑我一会儿，这样我很快就习惯了。

下一件讨厌的事儿就是钉马掌。这一开始也很难。主人亲自带我去铁匠铺，以确保我毫发无损，不受任何惊吓。铁匠把我的脚一个接一个地放在他的手里，削掉了蹄子上的一些部分。这没有弄疼我，所以我一动不动地三腿站定，直到他全部削完。随后，他拿出一块跟我的蹄形一样的蹄铁，用力扣上去，并用钉子钉过蹄铁，深深地嵌入我的蹄子里，这样铁掌就钉牢了。我的脚感到硬邦邦、沉甸甸的，但是很快我就习惯了。

现在进展很迅速，主人要进一步训练我戴马具，还有更多的新东西要戴。首先，我的脖子上要戴一个又硬又沉的马轭，缰绳上贴着我眼睛的两侧要有两大片遮光板，叫作眼罩。眼罩真是名副其实，因为戴上去，我就不能往两边看了，只能往前看。接下来，要放上一个小马鞍，上面带着一条绕过我尾巴的讨厌的硬皮带，这就是臀带。我不喜欢那条臀带，把我的长尾巴撩起来把皮带从下面穿过，简直跟咬马嚼子一样难受。我从来没有感到这样想踢人，当然不能踢这么好的一个主人，所以最终如此这般我就习惯了，可以像妈妈那样干活了。

我绝不能忘了提及我的一次训练经历，因为我一向认为这次训练让我受益匪浅。主人把我送到邻近的一个农场主那儿待了两周。那个农场主有一个一侧挨着铁路的牧场。那儿有一些绵羊和奶牛，我跟他们圈养在一起。

我永远也忘不了第一次看见火车开过时的情景。我正在牧场和铁路之间的隔离栏附近静静地吃草，这时听到远处传来一声怪响。我还没有弄清它来自何方，一列长长的黑色火车就呼哧呼哧地喷着烟飞驰而过；几乎还没等我喘过气来，它就消失不见了。我转过身，以最快的速度飞奔到牧场远处，我站在那儿，又惊又怕地喷着鼻息。那天还有好多其他火车经过，有些开得比较慢。这些火车都在附近的车站停下来，有时停车前还发出一阵可怕的尖鸣声和吱嘎声。我觉得这可怕极了，但是那些奶牛却继续非常安静地吃草，那个可怕的黑东西喷着汽轰隆隆地驶过时，他们几乎头都不抬一下。

头几天，我都不能安心地吃草。但是，后来我发现那个可怕的怪物从来不会开进田地里，也不会伤害我，我就不再理会它了。很快，我也像那些牛羊一样，对那呼啸而过的火车不大在意了。

从那以后，我见过好多马因看到蒸汽机或听到它的声响而惊慌不安，多亏好主人对我的照顾，到了火车站我也会像在自己的马厩里那样无所畏惧。

如果有人想调教好一匹马驹，就该遵循这样的方法。

主人经常将我和妈妈套在一起，因为妈妈稳重，可以教会我怎样比一匹生马走得更好。她告诉我说，我表现得越好，就越能得到善待，最明智的做法一向就是尽可能取悦主人。“但是，”她说，“人有多种多样，有的人像我们的主人那样善良体贴，为这种人效力，任何一匹马都会感到自豪；而有的人邪恶残忍，绝不应该有一匹马或一只狗为他效力。除此以外，还有好多愚蠢的人，他们自负、无知、粗心，从来不费心思考，这些人因为缺乏理性而比其他人更糟蹋马儿。尽管他们不是故意的，但是他们会那样做。我希望你会落到好人的手里，但是一匹马永远不知道谁会买他，谁会驾驭他。对我们来说，这一切都是运气。不过，我还是要说，无论在哪儿，你都要竭尽全力，保护好自己的名声。”





第四章　伯特维克庄园


这时，我常常站在马厩里，每天我的皮毛都要被刷到像秃鼻乌鸦的翅膀一样闪亮。五月初，从戈登先生家来了一个人，他把我带到门厅。主人说：“再见，小黑子，做个好马，要竭尽全力！”我无法说“再见”，就把鼻子放在他的手里，他和蔼地轻轻拍了拍我。我离开了第一个家。我跟戈登先生生活了几年，我不妨讲讲那儿的事儿。

戈登先生的庄园在伯特维克村边。进去时要经过一扇大铁门，门边是第一个门房，然后沿着一条两侧长满参天古树的平坦马路一路小跑，就到了另一个门房和另一扇大门。穿过这道门，就到了房子和花园。外面是他的家庭牧场、老果园和马厩。那儿足够安顿好多匹马，停放好多辆马车，而我只需要描述一下我被带进去的那个马厩。那儿非常宽敞，带有四个漂亮的畜栏，一扇向院子敞开的转轴大窗使整个地方既舒适又通风。

第一个畜栏很大，呈正方形，后面关着一扇木门。其他的都是普通畜栏，也都很好，但是没有第一个那么大。第一个畜栏里有一个放干草的底架和一个放谷物的低槽。这种畜栏被称为自由畜栏，因为被安置在里面的马不用拴，他想做什么就做什么。能拥有一个自由畜栏，真是太棒了。

马夫正是要把我安置在这个好畜栏里。这儿干净、可爱又通风。我从来没有住过比这更好的畜栏，四周的围栏不是很高，透过顶端的铁栏杆，我能看到外面发生的一切。

马夫给了我一些非常好吃的燕麦，轻轻地拍了拍我，温和地和我说完话就走了。

吃完燕麦后，我环顾四周，只见我旁边的马厩里站着一匹灰色的小肥马，长着浓密的鬃毛和毛发浓密的尾巴、非常漂亮的脑袋和灵巧别致的小鼻子。

我昂头探过畜栏顶部的铁围栏，问候道：“你好！你叫什么名字？”

他尽可能拉紧缰绳转过身，抬起头来，说道：“我叫快乐腿。我非常漂亮。我驮着那些年轻的小姐，有时还会拉着轻便车带我们的女主人出去。她们非常器重我，詹姆斯也一样。你要住在我隔壁这个畜栏吗？”

我说：“是的。”

“那好。”他说，“我希望你好有个脾气；我不喜欢任何咬人的邻居。”

正在这时，一个马头从那边的畜栏里朝我们这边张望，只见她耳朵向后耷拉着，眼神看上去有些暴躁。这是一匹高大的栗色母马，脖子颀长而美丽。她把目光移向我，说道：

“这么说，是你把我赶出了我的畜栏。来了一匹你这样的小马崽，竟然要把一位女士赶出自己的家，这真是件怪事啊。”

“对不起。”我说，“我没有赶走任何一个人，是那个带我来的人把我安置在这儿的，我跟这件事毫无关系。还有，什么小马崽，我都四岁了，已经长大了。我从来没有跟任何公马或母马争吵过，我希望能平静地生活。”

“好吧。”她说，“我们走着瞧。当然，我也不想跟你这个小东西争吵。”我没有再说什么。

下午，那匹母马出去时，快乐腿把事情的原委都告诉了我。

“事情是这样。”快乐腿说，“姜姐有咬人的坏习惯，所以人们都叫她姜姐。她住在自由畜栏时常常咬人。有一天，她咬了詹姆斯的胳膊，都咬出血了，所以尽管弗罗拉小姐和杰西小姐非常喜欢我，但是她们都怕走进这个马厩。她们常常送给我好吃的东西，像一个苹果、一根胡萝卜或一片面包什么的，但是自从姜姐站在那个畜栏之后，她们就不敢来了。我非常想念她们。如果你不咬人的话，我觉得她们以后还会再来。”

我告诉他说，除了青草、干草和谷粒之外，我从来不咬任何东西，也想不出姜姐能从咬人中找到什么乐趣。

“啊，我认为她的确什么乐趣也找不到。”快乐腿说，“这只是一个坏习惯。她说没有一个人对她好过，所以她为什么不该咬人呢？当然，这是一个很坏的习惯；但是，我确信，如果她说的一切都是真的，她来这儿之前一定受到过严重的虐待。约翰竭尽全力想让她高兴，詹姆斯也竭尽所能，如果马规矩，我们主人就绝不会用鞭子。所以，我认为，她在这儿脾气会变好的。你看，”他带着一副睿智的样子说，“我十二岁了，我知道好多事儿，所以我可以告诉你，对一匹马来说，四里八乡没有比这更好的地方了。约翰是这儿最好的马夫，他在这儿已经有十四年了。你也从来没有见过詹姆斯这样的好孩子，所以，姜姐没能留在那个畜栏里，都是她自己的过错。”





第五章　良好开端


马夫名叫约翰·曼利，他有妻子和一个小孩子，他们住在马厩旁边的小屋里。

第二天早上，他把我带到院子里，给我好好刷洗了一番。正当我带着一身又软又光的皮毛走进自己的畜栏时，戈登先生过来看我，好像非常高兴。“约翰，”他说，“我本来想今天早上试试这匹新马，但是我还有别的事儿。早饭后，你最好带他四处转转，沿着公地和乔木林走，然后顺着水磨坊和小河返回，这样就可以看出他的步速了。”

“我会的，主人。”约翰说。早饭后，他就来了，给我戴上了笼头。为了让我的脑袋舒适，他绑皮带时无论是抽出来还是塞进去，都小心翼翼的。随后，他拿过来马鞍，但是马鞍不够宽，放不到我的背上。他立即就发现了这个问题，又去拿了一个，这个尺寸正好。他骑上我，先是慢慢踱步，然后小跑，接着慢跑。当我们跑进公地时，他用鞭子轻轻地碰了我一下，我们就一路飞奔了起来。

“嗬，嗬！好样的。”他让我停住说，“我想你会喜欢跟着那些猎犬狩猎的。”

穿过庄园往回走时，我们碰见戈登先生和夫人正在散步。他们停下脚步，约翰也跳下了马。

“喂，约翰，他怎么样？”

“好极了，先生。”约翰答道，“他跑得像鹿一样快，精神也不错。只要稍微碰一下缰绳，就可以指挥他。在下面那块公地的尽头，我们遇到了一辆旅行大车，大车上面挂满了篮子、小地毯之类的东西。先生，你知道，好多马儿都无法平静地经过那些大车。他只好好地看了一眼，然后便尽可能从容愉快地继续往前走了。他们正在乔木林附近射猎兔子，附近响了一枪。他小停了一会儿，看了看，但是没有向左右偏移一步。我只是牢牢地抓着缰绳，没有催他，我认为他小时候没有受过惊吓或虐待。”

“那就好。”先生说，“明天我要亲自试试他。”

第二天，我被带到了主人面前。我记得妈妈和好心的老主人的忠告，他要我做什么，我就努力做什么。我发现他是一个很好的骑手，对他的马儿也很体贴。他回家时，夫人在门厅口等着，他骑上前去。

“啊，亲爱的，”她说，“你觉得这匹马怎么样？”

“他完全像约翰说的那样。”他答道，“我从来没有想到会有这么舒适的坐骑。我们叫他什么呢？”

“你喜欢乌木吗？”她说，“他像乌木一样黑。”

“不，不要叫乌木。”

“像你叔叔的那匹老马一样，你叫他黑鸟好吗？”

“不，他比原来那匹老黑鸟英俊多了。”

“是的，”她说，“他的确非常英俊，有一张如此甜美、和蔼的脸庞，还有一双如此漂亮、聪颖的眼睛——叫黑骏马，你说怎么样？”

“黑骏马——啊，不错，我认为这是一个很好的名字。如果你喜欢，这就是他的名字了。”于是，我就有了自己的名字。

约翰走进马厩时，告诉詹姆斯说，主人和夫人已经为我选了一个贴切的好名字，它有意义，不像马伦戈、佩加索斯或阿卜杜拉。他们俩都笑出了声，詹姆斯说：“要不是怕回忆起过去，我就应该给他取名叫罗布·罗伊，因为我从来没有见过两匹马长得这么像。”

“这也难怪。”约翰说，“难道你不知道他们俩都是格雷农场主家老伯爵夫人的孩子吗？”

这我以前从来没有听说过，原来那次狩猎时丧命的可怜的罗布·罗伊是我哥哥。难怪我妈妈那样心神不安。看来马儿没有任何亲属，至少被卖之后，他们就不相识了。

约翰似乎很为我骄傲。他经常把我的鬃毛和尾巴梳得几乎像女士们的头发一样光滑，还会对我说好多话。当然，我听不懂他说的所有的话，但是我越来越了解他的意图，以及他想要我做什么。渐渐地，我也十分喜欢他。他非常温柔善良，好像能了解马儿的感受。他为我梳洗时，知道我哪些地方疼痛、哪些地方怕痒。刷头时，他会小心翼翼地避开我的眼睛，就像那是他自己的眼睛一样。他从来不会惹我发火。

马童詹姆斯·霍华德也用自己的方式尽可能温和愉快地对我，所以我认为自己非常幸运。院子里还有一个帮忙的人，但是他不怎么负责我和姜姐的事儿。

几天之后，我得跟姜姐一起拉着马车出去。我不知道我们该怎么融洽相处。但是，除了我靠近时她后翻耳朵之外，她表现很好。她干活诚实，不遗余力地分担重量，真是一个拉双驾马车的最佳搭档。我们来到小山时，她没有放慢脚步，反而从马轭发力，担起重任，直接向前拉了起来。我们干活时都有同样的勇气，所以约翰往回拉我们的时候，常常比催我们前进的时候还要多。他从来不需要往我俩身上用鞭子。因此，我们的步伐非常一致，我发现在小跑时很容易跟上她的脚步，这使我们十分愉快。主人始终喜欢我们步调一致，约翰也一样。我们一起外出了两三次之后，就变得完全友好随和了，这让我觉得无拘无束。

至于快乐腿，他和我很快变成了好朋友。他是一个如此快乐、勇敢、心平气和的小伙子，人人都喜欢他，尤其是杰西和弗罗拉小姐，她们俩经常骑着他在果园里转悠，跟他和她们那只小狗欢欢玩得不亦乐乎。

我们的主人还有另外两匹马住在另一个马厩里。一匹叫正义，是杂色短腿马，主要用来骑或拉货车；另一匹是褐色老猎马，名叫奥利弗爵士。老猎马现在不再干活了，但是主人格外喜欢他，经常骑着他在庄园跑。他有时会在庄园里拉小型轻便车，或者带着一位年轻的小姐和她的父亲一起外出，因为他非常温顺，所以像快乐腿一样能得到孩子的信任。短腿马强壮、匀称、温顺，有时我们会在小牧场里聊一小会儿。但是，我当然不可能跟他亲密得像跟站在同一个马厩里的姜姐一样。





第六章　自由


我在新家快乐极了。如果说我还缺少一样东西的话，你们千万不要以为我不知足。所有跟我打交道的人都很好，我拥有明亮通风的马厩和最好的饲料。我还能要什么呢？啊，自由！在生命的前三年半，我尽享自由。但是，现在，一周周，一月月，毫无疑问——一年年，除了他们需要我的时候，我都必须夜以继日地站在马厩里，而且必须像那些干了二十年活的老马一样从容、节制。身上到处勒着皮带，嘴上戴着嚼子，眼上蒙着眼罩。我不是在抱怨，因为我知道必须这样。我只是想说，作为一匹充满活力的小马，我以前习惯了在那种大草地或平原上昂首甩尾，全速飞奔，然后再跑回来对着同伴喷鼻息——我是说，要这样永不再有任何随心所欲的自由地生活很难。有时，活动量少于平时的话，我就会感觉浑身有使不完的劲儿，所以约翰带我出去活动时，我实在无法保持安静。我仿佛必须得跳跃、舞动、奔腾，做我愿做的事儿。我知道我一定把约翰晃得够呛，尤其是刚开始。不过，他始终善良而又有耐心。

“稳住，稳住，我的孩子。”他常常说，“等一会儿，我们一定会好好跑动，你的蹄子很快就不会痒痒了。”于是，我们一出村子，他就会让我飞跑几英里，随后我会像以前一样精神抖擞，只是没有了他所说的烦躁。精力充沛的马儿，如果运动量不够，只是去玩，常被人称为轻浮。有些马夫会惩罚他们，但是我们的约翰并不这样。他知道这只是精力旺盛。不过，他有自己的一套方法，他通过说话的声调和缰绳的触摸，让我明白指令。如果他郑重其事，毅然决然，我总能从他的声音中听明白，那声音对我来说比其他任何东西都更有力量，因为我非常喜欢他。

我应该说，我们有时会有几个小时的自由，通常是在夏季天气晴好的礼拜天。因为离教堂不远，所以那天马车从来不出行。

我们被带进家庭牧场或老果园，是一大快事。我们的脚踩在凉爽、柔软的青草上，空气如此芬芳，想做什么就做什么，自由自在，真开心——飞奔、躺下、仰面翻滚或是轻轻细咬甜美的草儿。随后，我们一起站在那棵大栗树的树荫下，聊得好不开心。





第七章　姜姐


一天，我和姜姐站在树荫下，聊了好一阵子。她想知道我成长和受驯的所有情况，我就告诉了她。

“唉，”她说，“如果我的成长经历像你一样，我就会有像你一样好的脾气，但是，现在我相信我永远也不会有了。”

“为什么不会有呢？”我问。

“因为我的经历完全不一样。”她回答说，“从来没有一匹马或一个人善待过我，我也不想讨好谁，因为我一断奶，第一件事就是离开妈妈，跟其他好多小马放在一起。他们都不喜欢我，我也不喜欢他们中的任何一个。没有像你的主人那样和善的人照顾我，跟我说话，给我带好吃的东西。那个照管我们的人从来没有给过我一句好话。我不是说他虐待我，但是，除了确保我们食料充足、冬天有避寒之处外，他对我们再没有一丁点儿的关怀。一条人行道穿过我们的牧场，那些过路的男孩子经常会扔石头追赶我们。尽管我从来没有被击中过，但是有一匹小骏马的脸被严重划伤了，我想那一辈子都会有一道伤疤。我们不喜欢那些男孩子，而这自然让我们更加狂野，而且在我们的心里扎下了这样的观念：男孩子们是我们的敌人。我们也有过非常开心的日子，在自由自在的牧场上时而爬坡，时而俯冲，你追我赶绕着牧场一圈圈地奔跑，然后静静地站在树荫下面。但是，谈到受驯，那对我来说，真是一段难熬的日子。好几个人来抓我，最后他们把我堵到了田地的一个角落，一个人抓住我的额毛，另一个人紧紧拽住我的鼻子，我简直喘不过气来，还有一个人用力抓住我的下巴，掰开我的嘴，就这样强迫地给我套上了笼头，往我的嘴里塞进了衔铁。然后一个人拽住笼头拖着我走，另一个在后面鞭打，这是我第一次领教人类的仁慈——全都是暴力。他们根本没有给我机会去了解他们想怎么样。我是贵族血统，精力非常旺盛，也很狂野，所以毫无疑问，我敢说，我给他们带来了好多麻烦。而可怕的是，日复一日被关在马厩里毫无自由，所以我烦躁痛苦，想要解脱。要知道，有一个和气的主人常常哄着你，你都觉得自己够糟糕了，但是我什么也没有啊。

“以前有过一个名叫赖德先生的老主人，我以为他会让我很快改变想法，他本来可以为我做所有的一切，但是他把所有难事都交给了儿子和另一个有经验的人，他只是偶尔来看看。他的儿子高大、强壮而又莽撞，他们叫他萨姆森，他经常夸口说他从来没有发现一匹马能把他摔下来。他没有他爸爸身上的任何绅士风度，有的只是强硬的声音、强硬的眼神和强硬的手段。从一开始，我就感到他想做的就是耗尽我所有的精力，把我变成安分、卑微、顺从的行尸走肉。行尸走肉！是的，那就是他全部的想法。”说着，姜姐跺了跺脚，好像他的那个想法让她非常生气。随后，她接着说道：

“如果我没有完全按照他的想法去做，他就会恼怒，把我拴在训练场的长缰绳上让我绕着圈跑，直到我跑得筋疲力尽。我想他是喝多了酒，而且我非常清楚他酒喝得越频繁，对我来说就越糟糕。有一天，他想尽办法折腾我，我躺倒在地时，疲惫、痛苦而又生气。那一切看起来真让我难过。第二天一早，他就来找我，又让我绕圈跑了很长时间。我还没有休息一个小时，他就又拿着鞍子、马勒和一副新嚼子来找我了。我一直都说不清那件事是怎么发生的。他就在训练场上骑我，当我做的事儿不对他的脾气时，他就会用缰绳狠狠地驱赶我。新嚼子让我疼痛难忍，于是我突然后腿站立起来，这让他更加恼火，他开始鞭打我。我感到整个灵魂都在跟他对抗，于是我开始踢，开始冲，开始后腿站起，我以前从来没有后腿站起过。我们正面交锋。好一阵子，他都紧紧地夹住马鞍，用鞭子和马刺残酷地惩罚我，但是我热血沸腾，只要能把他撂下来，我毫不在乎他会使什么花招。最后，经过激烈搏斗，我把他向后甩翻在地。我听到他重重地摔在了草地上。我没有回头看他，飞快地跑到了牧场的另一头。到了那儿，我转过身，看到那个迫害我的人从地上慢慢地爬起来，走进了马厩。我站在橡树下看着，但是没有任何人来抓我。时间向前推进，太阳热辣辣的。苍蝇成群地围着我，落在我那被马刺戳得血流不止的侧腹上。我感到饥饿，因为我从早晨起就没有吃过东西，而草地上的草还不够一只鹅填饱肚子的。我想躺下休息，但是鞍子紧紧地绑在身上，无法放松，也没有一滴水喝。下午慢慢地过去了，太阳西沉。我看到其他小马都被带了回去，我知道他们正在美餐。

“最后，就在太阳落下时，我看到老主人手里端着筛子走了出来。他是一位很好的老先生，头发花白。我能从一千个声音里听出他的声音。他的声音不高不低，饱满、清晰、和蔼。他下令时沉稳坚定，每匹马、每个人都明白他期待你服从。他平静地走过来，不时地晃动筛子里的燕麦，高兴温和地对我说道：‘过来，小姑娘，过来，小姑娘。过来，过来。’我站在那儿一动不动，让他走近。他把燕麦递给我，我开始没有恐惧地吃了起来。他的声音带走了我所有的恐惧。他站在我的身边，在我进食时轻轻地拍打和抚摸我，看到我侧面的血块，他好像非常恼怒。‘可怜的小姑娘！糟糕，真糟糕！’随后，他平静地拉起缰绳，把我牵到了马厩。萨姆森就站在门口。我耳朵向后抿，朝他咬去。‘往后站，’主人说，‘别挡着她的路。今天你对这匹小母马做得真糟糕。’他咆哮着骂了恶毒的畜生之类的话。‘你听着，’他的父亲说，‘一个脾气不好的人绝不会驯出一匹好脾气的马。你还没有学会怎么做自己的工作，萨姆森。’随后，他把我牵进了我的畜栏，亲手卸下马鞍和马勒，把我拴好。接着，他要了一桶温水和一块海绵，脱下外套，让马夫拿着桶，在我的两边擦了好一阵子，非常体贴。我相信他知道那些伤口有多么肿痛。‘喔！我的漂亮宝贝儿，’他说，‘站着别动，站着别动。’他的声音的确对我有好处，洗浴也很舒服。我嘴角的皮肤都烂了，不能吃干草，草秆会伤到我。他仔细查看了那儿，摇了摇头，吩咐马夫去拿一些好吃的糠糊糊，把一些饭放进去。这种糊糊味道真好！吃到嘴里既柔软又有疗效。我吃东西时，主人一直都站在旁边，抚摸着我，对那个马夫说着话：‘如果不是用合理的手段来驯服一匹像这样精神饱满的牲口，那她永远都不会变乖。’

“之后，他经常来看我。而当我的嘴痊愈后，被他们叫作乔布的另一名驯马师继续训练我。他稳重体贴，我很快就学会了他想教我的东西。”





第八章　姜姐故事续


接下来的一次，我和姜姐一起待在小围场时，她给我讲了她干活的第一个地方。

“训练结束后，”她说，“我被一个马贩子买走了，和另一匹栗色马做搭档。他让我们一起拉了几个星期的车，然后我们就被卖给了一个时髦先生，被送到伦敦。那个马贩子曾经用马缰驾驭过我，我恨死那种马缰了。但是，在伦敦这个地方，我们被马缰勒得更紧，马夫和他的主人认为这样做能让我们看上去更漂亮。我们经常被赶着去公园或其他时尚场所转悠。你从来没有戴过马缰，不知道那是什么滋味，但是我可以告诉你，那非常可怕。

“我喜欢来回甩头，像其他马一样把头抬得高高的，但是你自己想想，如果你高昂着头，被迫保持那个高度，几个小时根本不能动弹，除了被猛地拽得更高。你的脖子会痛到无法忍受，你不知道该怎么忍受下去。除此以外，我还要戴两个马嚼子，而不是一个——我的马嚼子非常锋利，弄伤了我的舌头和下巴，舌头流出的血染红了从我的嘴唇不断飞溅的白沫，我对马嚼子和缰绳感到恼怒和焦躁。最糟糕的是，当我们的女主人去参加某个盛大宴会或娱乐活动时，我们不得不站着等好几个小时。如果我因为不耐烦而急躁或跺脚，鞭子就会抽在我的身上。这足以把一匹马逼疯！”

“你们的主人没有为你们想过吗？”我问道。

“没有，”她说，“他只关心拥有一个所谓漂亮的亮相。我觉得他对马知之甚少。他把一切都交给了马夫，马夫告诉他说我脾气急躁。我是没有好好受过勒马缰的训练，但是他不是能训好我的料，因为我在马厩里难受生气时，不但没有得到他善意的安抚让我平静，反而得到了一句脏话或一顿毒打。如果他有礼貌，我就会努力承受这一切。我愿意干活，也准备努力工作。但是，他们毫无理由随心所欲地折磨我，这让我生气。他们有什么权利让我这样受苦？除了我嘴里的伤和脖子上的痛之外，我的气管也非常难受。如果我在那儿待久了，我知道那就会损害我的呼吸系统。但是，我越来越烦躁不安，难以自制。无论是谁给我戴马具，我都会猛咬乱踢，为此马夫打过我。有一天，他们刚刚把我套进马车，要用缰绳把我的头拉高，我就开始拼命又冲又踢。我很快就挣坏了好多马具，踢蹬着完全挣脱开来。因此，我在那个地方待到了头。

“之后，我被送到塔特萨尔集市去卖。当然，谁也不能担保我不会有坏脾气，所以都没有说起这事儿。我漂亮的外表和矫健的步伐很快就引来了一位先生为我出价，后来我就被另一个马贩子买走了。他用各种方法和不同的马嚼子测试我，很快就弄清了我不能忍受什么。最后，他用完全不戴勒马缰绳的方式骑我，然后将我作为非常安分的马卖给了一位乡下绅士。他是一位好主人，我生活得很好，但是原来的马夫离开了他，来了一个新马夫。这个马夫像萨姆森一样心狠手辣。他说话的声音总是粗声恶气，很不耐烦。如果他需要我，我在马厩里没有动，他就会用马厩里的扫帚或耙子——拿起什么是什么——打我跗关节以上的部位。他做什么事儿都很粗鲁，所以我开始恨他。他想让我怕他，但是我气性太高了，偏不怕他。有一天，他激怒了我，比以往更厉害，我就咬了他。这当然让他大发雷霆，他就用一条马鞭开始抽我的头。之后，他再也不敢进我的马厩了。我的后蹄和牙齿都为他准备好了，这他知道。跟主人在一起时，我非常安分，主人却听信了马夫说的话，所以我又被卖了。

“还是同一个马贩子听说了我的消息，说他觉得他知道我到一个地方会干得很好。‘真可惜，’他说，‘这么好的一匹马因为缺乏真正的好机会，居然落到了这种糟糕的地步。’最后我在你来之前不久来到了这儿。但是，那时我就已经认定人是我的天敌，我必须自卫。当然这儿截然不同，但是谁知道这会持续多久呢？我希望自己能像你一样思考问题。而在经历了这一切之后，我做不到。”

“那么，”我说，“我认为，如果你还要踢或咬约翰或詹姆斯，那就真不像话了。”

她说：“他们对我好时我也不想。有一次，我的确狠狠地咬了詹姆斯。但是，约翰说：‘尽力对她好点儿。’而不是像我料想的那样惩罚我，詹姆斯包扎着胳膊，来到我的身边，给我端来了麦麸，抚摸我。从那以后，我没再咬过他，将来也不会了。”

我曾为姜姐难过，当然那时我知之甚少，所以我以为很可能是她把事儿搞得一塌糊涂。然而，过了几周，我发现她越来越温和，越来越快乐，任何陌生人走近时她的神情都没有了原来的警惕和傲慢。有一天，詹姆斯说：“我当真认为那匹母马渐渐地喜欢上我了，今天早上我揉摸她的前额后，她在我的身后发出了柔和的嘶鸣。”

“唉，唉，吉姆，这都是伯特维克庄园的疗效。”约翰说，“不久以后，她会像黑骏马一样友好。她需要的所有药物就是善良，可怜的家伙！”主人也注意到了这个变化，一天，他像往常一样走出马车，过来跟我们说话，他抚摸了一下她漂亮的脖子。“啊，我的美人儿，你现在过得怎么样？我想你比刚来时快乐多喽。”

当主人轻轻地抚摸姜姐时，她友善信任地把鼻子凑向了他。

“约翰，我们要治愈她。”他说。

“是的，主人，她进步惊人，不再是刚来时的样子了。先生，这是‘伯特维克庄园药丸’的功劳。”约翰笑着说道。

这是约翰开的一个小玩笑。他总是说，按照常规吃“伯特维克庄园药丸”一个疗程，几乎能治愈任何一匹凶猛的马。他说这些药丸是由耐心、温和、坚定和爱抚制成，每只药丸一磅重，掺入半品脱基本常识，每天喂给马吃。





第九章　快乐腿


教区牧师布罗姆菲尔德先生有好多子女，他们经常过来跟杰西小姐和弗罗拉小姐一起玩。其中的一个姑娘像杰西小姐一样大；两个男孩子年龄较大，还有好几个年龄小的男孩。他们来后，可有快乐腿的活儿干了，因为他们最开心的就是轮流骑在他的身上，在果园或家庭牧场里到处转悠，这样在一起一转就是一个小时。

一天下午，快乐腿跟着他们出去了好长时间。当詹姆斯把他带进来，给他戴上缰绳时，说道：

“好了，你这坏蛋，对你自己的所作所为留点儿神，否则我们都会有麻烦。”

“你都做了什么，快乐腿？”我问道。

“噢！”他甩了甩小脑袋说，“我只是教训了一下那些年轻人。他们不知道什么时候他们已经玩够了，也不知道什么时候我已经受够了，所以我就把他们都从后面尥出去了。只有这样做，他们才能明白。”

“什么！”我说，“你把孩子们尥出去了？我还以为你比这懂事呢。你把杰西小姐或弗罗拉小姐也尥出去了吗？”

看上去他大为生气，说道：

“当然没有。就是给马厩里送来最好的燕麦，我也不会做这种事儿。啊，我像主人一样尽可能关心我们的小姐。至于那些小不点儿，是我教会她们骑马的。当她们骑在我背上受到惊吓或有点儿坐不稳时，我就会像一只追赶小鸟的老猫一样安稳从容。等她们平安无事后，我又会继续加快步伐，你明白，就是为了让她们适应，所以不必费心来说教我。我是那些孩子最好的朋友，也是她们最好的骑术教练。不是她们，是那些男孩子，男孩子们，”他摇晃着鬃毛说，“截然不同，他们必须像我们小时候那样接受驯服。就得有人告诉他们什么是什么。其他孩子骑在我身上转悠将近两个小时，所以男孩子们觉得该轮到他们了，就是这样，我非常愉快。整整一个小时，他们轮流骑着我，我驮着他们到处跑，在地里跑上跑下，跑遍了果园。他们每个人都削了一根大榛树枝做马鞭，下手有点儿太狠了，但是我都欣然接受了。后来我认为他们玩够了，就停下来两三次，作为暗示。你明白，那些男孩子认为马或小型马就像蒸汽机或打谷机一样，可以随他们心意要跑多久就多久，想要跑多快就多快。他们绝不会去想马会疲倦，也绝不会去想马有感情。所以，那个用鞭子抽我的孩子不明白，我就用后腿作为支撑抬起身来，让他从后面滑了下去——仅此而已。他又骑上了我，我又如法炮制。随后，另一个男孩子上来了，他一开始用树枝，我就把他放倒在草地上，如此这般，直到他们能明白为止——仅此而已。他们不是坏孩子，他们并不希望表现得残酷无情。我非常喜欢他们，但是，你明白，我不得不教训他们。当他们把我带到詹姆斯那儿告状时，我想詹姆斯看到那些大树枝后非常生气。他说这些树枝只适合牲口贩子或吉卜赛人用，而不适合年轻绅士。”

“如果我是你，”姜姐说，“我就会狠狠地踢那些男孩子一顿，那会给他们一个教训。”

“你肯定会。”快乐腿说，“但是，当时（恕我直言），我还没有傻到去让主人生气或让詹姆斯蒙羞的地步。此外，那些孩子在骑马时由我照管。我告诉你，他们非常信任我。啊，就在前几天，我听到我们的主人对布罗姆菲尔德夫人说：‘我亲爱的夫人，你不必担心孩子们。我的老快乐腿会像你或我一样照顾他们。我向你保证，我不会用那匹马去卖钱，他是那样心平气和，值得信任。’你以为我会因为几个无知的男孩子对我不好，就忘记五年来我在这儿受到的所有善待，忘记他们对我的所有信任，成为一个忘恩负义的畜牲吗？不，不会！因为你去过的地方从来没有人善待你，所以你不了解，我也为你难过。但是，我可以告诉你，好地方才能出好马。无论如何，我都不会烦扰这儿的人。我爱他们，我真的爱他们。”说着，快乐腿鼻子里发出了低沉的“嗬，嗬，嗬！”声，就像早上他听到门口传来詹姆斯的脚步声时经常做的那样。

“况且，”他接着说道，“如果我喜欢踢人，我会在哪儿呢？啊，会被马上卖掉，没有名誉，我也许会受一个屠夫的孩子奴役，或是在海边的一个地方干活累死，那儿没有人关心我，他们只想弄清我能跑多快，或者像我来这儿之前在住的地方看到的那样，礼拜天被一路鞭打着拉着坐有三四个大人物的马车出去寻欢作乐。不，”他摇着头说，“我希望自己永远不要落到那个地步。”





第十章　果园里的谈话


我和姜姐都不是那种常见的体型高大的拉车马，我们身上更具有赛马血统。我们站起来大约有十五个半手高，所以我们无论当坐骑还是拉车都是好手，我们的主人常说他不喜欢只能做一件事的马或人。他不想在伦敦的公园里炫耀，所以他比较喜欢那种更活跃、更实用的马。对我们来说，最大的快乐就是戴上鞍具去参加一个骑马派对。男主人骑姜姐，女主人骑我，小姐们骑奥利弗爵士和快乐腿。大家在一起时而小跑，时而慢跑，非常开心，这总是让我们兴高采烈。我做的事儿最好，因为我总是驮女主人。她体重很轻，声音甜美，一只手轻轻地拉着缰绳，我在被牵引时几乎感觉不到她在拉缰绳。

噢！如果人们知道由一只轻柔的手牵引对马儿来说有多么惬意，如果他们知道那样做既能让马嘴完好，又能让马儿保持好脾气，肯定就不会再像平日拉缰绳时那样又勒又拖又拽了。我们的嘴很嫩，只要不是因为粗暴无知的对待而受伤或变硬，它们就能感知骑手哪怕最轻微的手部动作。需要我们做什么，我们马上就会知道。我的嘴从来没有受过伤，我相信这就是我们的女主人喜欢我而不喜欢姜姐的原因，尽管她的步伐的确也很好。姜姐经常嫉妒我，她的嘴没有我的那样完美，说这都是因为受驯和在伦敦戴马嚼子造成的。这时，奥利弗爵士常常会说：“好了，好了！不要自寻烦恼了。你最荣耀了，一匹母马能驮我们主人这样重、这样高的男人，而且动作敏捷，弹跳力好，不必因没有驮女主人而垂头丧气。只要人们善待我们，我们就必须安于现状，始终知足听话。”

我经常纳闷奥利弗爵士的尾巴怎么那么短。从上面垂下的流苏般的尾毛，真的只有六七英寸长。一个假日，我们在果园里时，我大胆地问他，是什么事故让他丢了尾巴。“事故？”他狠狠地看了我一眼，轻蔑地哼道，“不是事故！是一次残忍、可耻、无情的行为！小时候，我被带到了一个地方，就是在那儿发生了这些残忍的事儿。我被绑了起来，绑得紧紧的，无法动弹，然后他们过来剪掉了我漂亮的长尾巴，连骨带肉都拿走了。”

“真可怕！”我惊叫道。

“可怕啊！真可怕，而可怕的不仅仅是疼痛，尽管那种疼痛非常可怕，而且持续了很长时间。这不仅仅是夺去我身上最好装饰的无礼举动，尽管那已经很糟了，最重要的是，这样的话，我怎么再去拂掉那些叮在我两侧和后腿上的苍蝇？你们有尾巴的马不用想就能拂去苍蝇，所以你说不出苍蝇落在你身上叮来叮去，而你没有任何东西可以把他们赶走，是何等的折磨！我告诉你这是终生的错误，也是终生的损失。但是，谢天谢地，他们现在不再这样做了。”

“他们当时为什么这样做？”姜姐问道。

“为了时髦！”老马跺了跺脚说，“为了时髦！你知道这是什么意思吧；我那个时代没有一匹良种小马的尾巴不被人以可耻的方式剪短的，就像创造我们的仁慈上帝不知道我们需要什么，也不知道怎么才最好看一样。”

“我想，我在伦敦时，他们用皮带把我的头绑起来，嘴里塞上那种可怕的马嚼子，让我受尽折磨，就是为了时髦。”姜姐说。

“当然是！”他说，“在我看来，时髦是世界上最邪恶的东西之一。比如，现在看看他们是怎么对付那些狗的；为了让他们看上去更勇敢，剪掉他们的尾巴；为了使他们看上去机灵，把他们漂亮的小耳朵剪成尖尖的形状，真是这样。我曾有一个亲密的朋友，那是一只褐色小猎犬，他们叫她匐犬。她非常喜欢我，睡觉从来不离开我的马厩。她把睡觉的地方安在马槽下面，在那儿一窝产下了五只小狗，要多漂亮有多漂亮；没有一只被溺死，因为他们都是珍贵品种，她和孩子们在一起是多么开心啊！当那些小狗睁开眼睛到处爬时，那情景真可爱。但是，有一天，有人过来把他们都带走了。我想也许是担心我会踩到他们吧。但是，并非如此。晚上，可怜的匐犬又把他们一个个叼了回来。他们不再是从前那些开心的小家伙，而是流着血，可怜地哭着。他们的尾巴都被剪掉了一截，漂亮的小耳朵上的柔软耳翼完全被剪掉了。他们的妈妈舔着他们，神色是多么不安，真可怜啊！我永远不会忘记那情景。他们最后都痊愈了，忘记了疼痛。当然，为了使耳朵娇柔部分隔离灰尘及预防伤害的漂亮柔软的耳翼，却一去不复返了。为什么那些人不把自己孩子的耳朵也剪成尖尖的，让他们显得更机灵呢？为什么他们不剪掉自己的鼻尖，让他们显得更勇敢呢？大家都一样有感觉。他们有什么权利折磨和毁坏上帝的生灵呢？”

尽管奥利弗爵士非常温和，但也是一个充满感情的老家伙。他说的一切对我来说都十分新鲜，也很可怕，我发现自己心里对人类产生了一些前所未有的憎恨之情。当然，姜姐非常激动。她仰起头，眼睛闪亮，鼻孔张大，宣称人类既是暴徒又是笨蛋。

“谁说笨蛋呢？”快乐腿说，他刚从老苹果树那边过来，一直在矮枝上蹭着，“谁说笨蛋呢？我想这是坏话。”

“坏话就是用来说坏东西的。”说着，姜姐把奥利弗爵士说的一切告诉了他。

“一点儿没错。”快乐腿伤心地说，“我在当初住的地方经常看到这样的狗。但是，我在这儿不愿谈论这一点。你们知道，主人，还有约翰和詹姆斯，一向对我们很好，在这样的地方对人说三道四好像既不公平又忘恩负义，你们知道，除了我们的主人之外，还有好多好主人和好马夫，当然我们那几位是最好的。”

我们都知道好心的小快乐腿的这番至理名言所言不虚，所以都平静下来，尤其是奥利弗爵士，他对主人情有独钟。为了转变话题，我说：“谁能告诉我眼罩的用处？”

“不能！”奥利弗爵士简短地说，“因为它们没有任何用处。”

“应该是，”杂色矮脚马正义平静地说，“用来防止马儿受惊跳起，也防止马儿受到惊吓引起事故。”

“那他们不给骑的马，尤其是女士骑的马戴眼罩，这是什么原因？”我又问道。

“根本没有任何原因，”他平静地说，“除非也为了时髦。他们说，如果马儿看到了自己拉的或是从后面驶来的马车的轮子，就一定会受惊而逃，尽管街道拥挤时被赶的马儿完全看到了周围的一切。我承认，有时轮子挨得太近，会令人不快，但是我们不会逃跑。我们习惯了，而且明白事理。如果我们从来没有戴过眼罩，我们就永远不需要它。我们应该看到那儿是什么，知道什么是什么，比只看到一点儿我们不明白的东西更能减少恐惧。当然，也许一些马儿小时候受过伤或受过惊吓，戴上眼罩说不定会好些。但是，因为我从来不紧张，所以我无法判断。”

“我认为，”奥利弗爵士说，“夜里戴着眼罩是件危险的事儿。我们马儿在黑暗中比人的视力好得多。如果马能充分利用自己的眼睛，好多事故就绝不会发生。我记得，几年前的一个黑夜，两匹马拉着一辆灵车返回，正好经过斯帕罗农场主家的房子，那儿的池塘紧挨马路，车轮离池边太近了，灵车就翻进了水里，两匹马都淹死了，车夫几乎是死里逃生。当然，这次事故之后，那儿就圈起了一道结实的白色围栏，人们很容易看见。但是，如果那些马没有被蒙住部分眼睛，他们就会自觉远离池边，事故也就不会发生了。你来这儿之前，我们主人的马车就翻倒过。据说，如果左边的灯没有熄灭，约翰就会看到筑路工留下的那个大坑。他也许是这样，而如果老科林没有戴眼罩，无论有没有灯，他都会看见，因为他是一匹老马，完全知道不能去冒险。事实上，他伤得很重，马车也摔坏了，约翰是怎么死里逃生的，谁也不知道。”

“我应该说，”姜姐抽了抽鼻子说，“这些人如此聪明，最好下命令，将来所有的小马生下来，都应该把眼睛长在额头正中央，而不是两边。他们总是认为他们可以改造自然，改善上帝创造的一切。”

气氛又变得紧张起来，这时快乐腿仰起机灵的小脸，说道：“我要告诉你们一个秘密：我相信约翰不赞成眼罩。有一天，我听到他和主人谈起了这个想法。主人说：‘如果马儿已经习惯戴眼罩，再摘去眼罩，就可能会有些危险。’约翰说，他认为，所有小马在受驯时不戴眼罩，将会是一件好事，外国有些地方就是这样。所以，让我们振作起来，跑去果园那头吧。我相信风已经刮掉了一些苹果，我们不妨像那些刺蛾一样吃了它们。”

我们都无法拒绝快乐腿的主意，于是中断了长谈，大快朵颐地吃起了散落在地上的甜甜的苹果，又打起了精神。





第十一章　坦率对话


我在伯特维克住的时间越长，就越为有这个好地方而感到自豪和快乐。我们的男主人和女主人赢得了所有认识他们的人的尊重和爱戴。他们善待每个人、每个事物，不仅善待男男女女，而且善待马、驴、狗、猫、牛和鸟儿。没有一个受过压迫或虐待的动物不是他们的朋友，他们的仆人也是同样的风格。如果村里哪个小孩子残忍地虐待动物，他们很快就会从伯爵府那儿听到。

他们说，先生和农场主格雷共同努力了二十多年，终于去掉了拉货马的勒马缰绳，所以在我们这一带你很少见到那种缰绳。有时，如果女主人碰见一匹负载很重的马儿被拉起脑袋，就会停下马车，走出去，用甜美而又严肃的声音跟车夫理论，尽力向他说明这样做是多么愚蠢和残忍。

我认为没有人能对抗我们女主人的理论。我希望所有的女士都像她一样。我们的男主人有时也十分严厉。我记得，一天早上，他骑着我回家，这时我们看到一个身强力壮的人赶着一辆轻便马车朝我们驶来，拉车的是一匹漂亮的红棕色小马，细细的腿，头和脸都高贵灵敏。就在来到庄园大门时，那个小家伙转向了大门。那个车夫没有命令，也没有警告，突然用力猛地扭回马头，都快让马头挨到屁股了。回过神后，马继续前进，那个人开始狂暴地鞭打他。小马突然冲向前，但是那只强壮有力的手又把漂亮的小东西拽了回来，力气大得几乎足以折断他的下颚，鞭子还在往他的肉里抽。这情景让我心惊肉跳，因为我知道这会让那张细嫩的小嘴多么痛苦。不过，主人向我发令，于是我们立刻追上了他。

“索耶，”他厉声喊道，“那匹小马是血肉做的吗？”

“有血有肉有脾气！”他说，“他太喜欢自作主张了，这不适合我。”他说话时好像带着强烈的情绪。他是一个建筑工，以前因为生意经常来庄园。

“你以为，”主人严厉地说，“这样对他，会让他喜欢顺从你的心意吗？”

“他没有权利转那个弯，他的路是一直向前！”那个人粗鲁地说。

“你经常驾着这匹小马上我这个地方来，”主人说，“这只说明他既有记性又有头脑，他怎么知道你今天不是又要到那儿去呢？不过，这跟那个没有多大关系。索耶先生，我必须说，你惨无人道地虐待一匹小马，我真心疼得看不下去，你这样感情用事，不仅伤害了这匹马，更损害了你自己的品格。记住，人们会根据我们的所作所为，对我们作出评判，无论这些所作所为是针对人还是针对畜牲。”

主人骑着我慢慢地回家，我从他的声音可以听出这件事让他多么伤心。他刚才跟同等地位的绅士说话时，就像是对比他地位低的人说话一样随意。还有一天，我们出门时，遇到了兰利上尉，他是我们主人的一个朋友，正驾着一对英俊的灰马，调教他们拉车。他们聊了一会儿之后，上尉说道：

“你觉得我这个新马队怎么样，道格拉斯先生？你知道，你可是这一带的识马行家，我想听听你的意见。”

主人让我后退一点儿，以便好好看那两匹马。“他们是一对少见的骏马，”他说，“如果他们表里如一的话，我确信，你就不用指望得到更好的马儿了。但是，我看你还是死守着你那个宠物训练方案来折磨你的马儿，削减他们的实力。”

“你什么意思？”另一个人说，“是说马缰？噢，啊！我知道这是你的爱好。那么，实际上，我喜欢看到我的马儿保持昂首的姿态。”

“我也喜欢，”主人说，“和其他人一样喜欢，但是我不希望看到马头被抬高。那会让他们失去所有的光彩。好了，兰利，你是一位军人，肯定想看到你的部队在阅兵时有抬头挺胸之类养眼的表现。但是，如果士兵们的头都绑在一块靠背板上，你就不会为自己的操练得到多少赞扬了。这样做除了让士兵们烦恼和疲劳之外，可能对阅兵没有多大伤害。然而，如果拼刺刀向敌人冲锋陷阵呢？那时，他们需要自由运用每一块肌肉，全力上阵。我想他们取胜的可能性不大。马儿也完全一样：你让他们的性情变得烦躁和焦虑，会削减他们的力量，不能使他们尽力干活，因此他们的关节和肌肉都会过劳，这当然也会加快他们的损耗。放心好了，马儿跟人一样，也需要让脑袋自由活动。如果我们多按照常识行事，少追些时髦，我们就会发现好多事儿都会更加容易。而且，你和我一样了解，如果马儿迈错步子，脑袋和脖子却被紧紧地绑在后面，自行调整的可能性就会大大降低。好了，”主人笑着说道，“我已经让小马跑了好一阵子，你能不能下决心也骑上他呢，上尉？你的范例将会影响深远。”

“我相信你在理论上是对的，”上尉说，“你拿士兵举例非常有力，不过——好吧——我会考虑的。”他们就此别过。





第十二章　暴风雨天


晚秋的一天，我的主人有事要出一趟远门。我被套进了轻便双轮马车，约翰跟主人同行。我一向喜欢拉轻便双轮马车，车子很轻，高高的轮子转起来真带劲儿。大雨过后，现在又刮起了大风，落叶纷纷扬扬地横扫过路面。我们一路上都很开心，直至来到了关卡。那儿有一座矮木桥，河岸相当高。桥不是那种拱桥，而是水平架在河上，因此如果河水满的话，水就会淹到河中央的桥木和踏板。但是，两边的栏杆都非常结实，所以人们都毫不在意。

守关卡的人说河水涨得很快，他担心今天晚上会很糟。好多牧场都淹在了水下，路面上有一个低洼处，河水已经淹到我的膝盖了。但是，底下的桥面不错，主人驾车比较小心，所以过桥没问题。

我们到达镇上后，我当然是好好吃了一顿，主人的生意却占用了他很长时间，所以我们直到傍晚时分才返程回家。这时，风越来越大了，我听到主人对约翰说，他从来没有在这样的暴风天出过门，我也是这样想的。我们沿着树林的边缘走，大树枝像小枝条一样摇来晃去，呼啸而过的风声可怕极了。

“我希望我们能安全驶出这片树林。”主人说。

“是的，先生。”约翰说，“如果一根这样的树枝砸在我们身上，那可就糟了。”

他话刚一出口，就传来了吱嘎声、噼啪声、爆裂声、撕裂声和撞击声。树林中，一棵橡树从根部断裂开来，正好横在我们面前的路上。我绝不能说自己没有被吓倒，因为我真的被吓坏了。我停下来站定，我相信自己在颤抖。当然，我没有转身，也没有逃跑。从小接受的训练不允许我那样做。约翰跳下马车，立刻走到我面前。

“真是死里逃生啊。”主人说，“现在该怎么办呢？”

“唉，先生，我们既无法从那棵树上越过去，也无法绕过去，无可奈何，只能回到那四个岔道口，得足足走上六英里，我们才能回到木桥那儿。这样，我们回去就要晚了，不过这匹马还精神着呢。”

于是，我们就往回走，绕过岔路口，而等我们走到桥边时，天都快黑了。我们只能看到水漫过桥中央。洪水来时，这种事儿时有发生，所以主人没有停车。我们以相当快的速度前进着，而我一踩到桥面，就确信情况不对。我不敢向前走，就纹丝不动地站住了。“继续走啊，美人儿。”说完，主人用鞭子碰了我一下，我却不敢动。他猛地抽了我一鞭子，我前蹄扬起，但还是不敢前进。

“情况不对，先生。”说着，约翰从车上纵身跳下，来到我面前，四处瞧了瞧。他尽力想拉我前进。“快点儿，美人儿，怎么了？”当然，我无法告诉他，但是我非常清楚桥不安全。

就在这时，对面关卡那个人从房子里跑出来，发疯似的晃着手电筒。

“嗬，嗬，嗬！喂！站住！”他喊道。

“出了什么事儿？”主人大声问道。

“桥中间断了，有一部分被冲走了。你们要是继续走的话，就会掉进河里的。”

“谢天谢地！”主人说，“你这美人儿！”说着，约翰拉起缰绳，轻轻地牵着我，转向河边靠右的道路。太阳已经落下一段时间了。狂风大作，刮断了那棵树后，似乎已经暂时停息了。天越来越黑，周围越来越静了。我静静地小跑着，车轮在松软的路上几乎无声无息。好一阵子，主人和约翰都没有说话，后来主人口气严肃地开口说话。他们说的那些话，我大多听不懂。但是，我发现他们都认为，如果我按照主人的吩咐继续走的话，桥十有八九就会坍塌，马儿、马车、主人和仆人都会掉进河里。而且水流湍急，没有灯，附近也没有帮手，十有八九我们会统统被淹死。主人说，上帝给了人类理智，他们可以借此发现事物的规律。然而，他给动物的是不需要推理的知觉，这种知觉要快捷、完美得多，他们常常能借此挽救人的生命。约翰会讲好多马和狗的故事，还会讲他们做过的奇妙事情。他认为，人类没有充分认识到动物的价值，也没有跟他们交朋友，而这些本是人类应该做的。我确信，如果有人跟动物交朋友，那就是他。

我们终于来到了庄园门口，发现园丁正等着我们回来。他说，天黑后，女主人就一直提心吊胆，害怕发生什么意外，还说她已经派詹姆斯骑着杂色短腿马正义向木桥那边打听我们的消息去了。

我们看到门厅和楼上的窗户里都亮着灯。我们走上来时，女主人跑出来，说道：“亲爱的，你真的平安无事吗？噢！我担心死了，一直在胡思乱想。你没有遇到什么意外吧？”

“没有，亲爱的。但是，要不是你的黑骏马比我们明智，我们早就在木桥那边统统被冲进河里去了。”他们走进屋里后，我没有再听到什么。约翰把我牵到了马厩。噢，那天夜里，他给了我一顿美餐，有好吃的糠糊糊和燕麦豆沫，还铺了厚厚的稻草床！我真开心，因为我累了。





第十三章　魔鬼标志


一天，我和约翰出去为主人办事回来，轻快地走在一条漫长笔直的路上，这时我们看到远处一个男孩子正在试图让一匹小马翻越一道栅栏。小马不愿跳，那个男孩子就用鞭子狠狠地抽他，小马只是躲到了一边。男孩子又抽他，小马又躲到了另一边。随后，那个男孩子跳下马，劈头盖脸一阵猛抽。接着，他又骑上马，恬不知耻地一直踢那匹小马，想让小马跃过去，而小马却拒绝起跳。当我们快走到跟前时，小马低下头，扬起蹄子，干净利落地把那个男孩子甩进了宽阔的树篱，一路飞奔跑回了家，缰绳还挂在头上。约翰哈哈大笑。“罪有应得！”他说。

“噢，噢，噢！”那个男孩子在荆棘丛中挣扎着大声叫喊，“我说，过来帮我出去啊。”

“谢天谢地。”约翰说，“我想你完全是罪有应得，也许一点儿擦伤会让你知道，你不该让小马去跃过一道太高的栅栏。”说完，约翰就走了。“也许，”他自言自语道，“那个年轻家伙既是骗子又是暴徒。我们回家正要经过布什比农场主家。美人儿，如果有人想了解情况的话，我和你就可以告诉他们，你明白吧。”于是，我们转向右边，很快就来到了堆谷场，看到了那所房子。那个农场主正匆匆地走向大路，他的妻子正站在大门口，一副万分惊恐的神情。

“你们看到我的孩子了吗？”我们走近时，布什比先生问道，“他一小时前骑着我的那匹小黑马出去，小马刚刚回来了，而马背上却没有人。”

“先生，我认为，”约翰说，“马背上最好没有人，除非有人得体地骑着。”

“你这话什么意思？”农场主问道。

“好了，先生，你的儿子真不像话，我看到他对那匹善良的小马又抽又踢又砸，就因为马儿不愿去跳一道对他来说太高的栅栏。先生，小马表现良好，没有任何缺点。而最终，他只是扬起蹄子把那位年轻的先生抛进了荆棘树篱。那位年轻的先生想让我帮他。但是，我希望你能原谅我，先生，我觉得自己不应该帮他。他没有骨折，先生，只是被刮了几下。我爱马，见到马儿受到虐待，就会恼火。激怒一匹马，让他扬蹄可不是好事儿。通常有了第一次，就不会是最后一次。”

这时，孩子的妈妈开始哭了起来：“噢，我可怜的比尔，我必须去看他。他一定受伤了。”

“老婆，你最好进屋。”农场主说，“比尔需要这样一个教训，我一定要让他明白。他虐待那匹小马可不是一次两次了，我要阻止他。非常感谢你，曼利。再见。”

于是，我们继续前进，一路上约翰格格直笑。后来，他把这事儿告诉了詹姆斯，詹姆斯也大笑着说：“他罪有应得。我在学校时就认识那小子。因为他是农场主的儿子，所以就趾高气扬，经常大摇大摆地走路，欺负小男孩。当然，我们这些比他大的人可不容任何人胡闹，我们让他知道，在学校里、操场上，农场主的儿子和劳工的儿子都是一样的。我清晰记得，一天下午快上课时，我发现他在大窗户边逮苍蝇，拽下他们的翅膀。他没有看见我，我给了他一耳光，让他四仰八叉地躺在了地上。啊，尽管我很生气，但是几乎吓得要死，他煞有介事地吼叫咆哮。男孩子们都从操场上冲过来，男老师也从路上跑过来看看谁在遭受残害。当然，我马上把自己做过的事儿和为什么这样做都一五一十地说了出来。随后，我给那个老师看了那些苍蝇，有些已经粉身碎骨了，有些还在无助地爬着。我还给他看了窗台上的那些苍蝇翅膀。我从来没有见老师生过那么大的气。但是，比尔还在那儿号叫哭诉，就像一个懦夫。老师没有再给他那种惩罚，而是让他整个下午都站在凳子上，说那一周比尔都不能出去玩。接着，老师非常严肃地对所有男孩子谈起了残忍，说伤害弱小无助者是多么无情和懦弱，而让我铭记在心的是这句话，他说残忍是魔鬼特有的标志，如果我们看到谁以残忍为乐，我们就能知道他属于什么样的人，因为魔鬼一开始是谋杀犯，最后是折磨犯。相反，如果我们看到谁爱戴邻居，善待人和畜牲，我们就能知道那是上帝的标志。”

“你们老师教给你们的再正确不过了。”约翰说，“没有爱，就没有宗教信仰。人们可能喜欢大谈宗教信仰，但是，如果宗教不教给他们善待人和畜牲，一切就都是谎言——一切就都是谎言，詹姆斯，当黑白颠倒时，宗教就站不住脚了。”





第十四章　詹姆斯·霍华德


十二月的一天早晨，我做完每天的晨练后，约翰把我牵进马厩，给我绑裹护体防寒的布条，詹姆斯端着燕麦从谷仓那边走进来，这时主人也走进了马厩。他看上去神情相当严肃，手里拿着一封打开的信。约翰关紧我的畜栏门，触帽敬礼，等候吩咐。

“早上好，约翰，”主人说，“我想知道你对詹姆斯是否有什么意见。”

“先生，意见？没有，先生。”

“他干活勤快，对你尊重吗？”

“是的，先生，一向如此。”

“你从来没有发现他在你不在场时干活懈怠吗？”

“从来没有，先生。”

“那就好，但是我必须问另一个问题。当他跟那些马儿一起出去锻炼或送信时，你是否有理由怀疑，他会停下来与他相识的人说话，或者没事儿走进屋里，把马儿留在外面呢？”

“没有，先生，当然没有。如果有人这样说詹姆斯，我不会相信，我也不打算相信，除非有证人对我公正地证实这一点。先生，我不是说谁在企图诋毁詹姆斯的品格，而是要说，在这个马厩里从来没有一个年轻家伙比他稳重、乐观、诚实和机灵。我能够相信他说的话，能够相信他做的事儿。他对马儿温和，人也机智，我宁愿让他掌管这些马，也不愿把他们交给我认识的戴花边帽、穿制服的年轻人照管。无论是谁想了解詹姆斯·霍华德的品格，”约翰坚定地甩了一下脑袋说，“那就让他们来找约翰·曼利。”

主人一直站在那儿，神情严肃专注。但是，等约翰说完时，主人脸上绽开了灿烂的笑容，亲切地看着一直静立在门边的詹姆斯，说道：“詹姆斯，我的伙计，放下燕麦，过来吧。我非常高兴地发现约翰对你品质的认识正好跟我不谋而合。约翰是一个慎重的人，”他带着滑稽的微笑说道，“很少见他对别人发表看法，所以我认为旁敲侧击，鸟儿就会飞出来，我很快就会知道我想知道的事儿了。那现在我们谈正事吧。我收到了我姐夫克利福德·威廉斯爵士从克利福德府寄来的一封信。他想要我帮他找一个值得信任的年轻马夫，大约二十岁到二十一岁，精通业务。老马夫跟他在一起生活了三十年，身体渐渐虚弱，他想找个人跟他一起工作，熟悉他的路数，老人退休后能接替他的工作。他起初每周能获得十八先令，有马厩装、骑马装，卧室在马车房上面，手下有一个马童。克里福德爵士是一位好主人。如果你能得到这个职位，那对你来说将是一个良好的开端。我不想跟你分开，如果你离开我们，我们知道约翰就会失去得力助手。”

“那是，先生。”约翰说，“不过，我不会阻挡他的前途。”

“你多大了，詹姆斯？”主人说。

“明年五月就十九岁了，先生。”

“很年轻，你意下如何，约翰？”

“啊，先生，是很年轻。但是，他像男人一样稳重健壮、发育良好，尽管他在赶车方面经验不多，但是他手疾眼快，小心翼翼，我确信他的马儿绝不会因马蹄或马掌缺乏照顾而被毁掉。”

“约翰，你的话会最有说服力。”主人说，“因为克里福德爵士在附言中补充说：‘如果能找到一个约翰训练出来的人，我就会喜欢不尽。’所以，詹姆斯，伙计，仔细考虑一下，吃饭时跟你的妈妈说说，然后把你的想法告诉我。”

这次谈话后没过几天，事情就完全定了下来，一个月或六周之后，詹姆斯就要去克里福德府了。这样詹姆斯既满足了主人的愿望，同时也会得到所有驾车方面的训练，那都是他可能会用得上的。我以前从来都没见过马车这样频繁地出门，原来女主人不出门时，主人会亲自驾着双轮马车出去，但是，现在无论是主人还是小姐们，或者仅仅是听差要出门，我和姜姐都要被套进马车，由詹姆斯驾驭我们。起先，约翰在驾驶座陪他，对他进行全面指导，后来詹姆斯就独自驾车了。

接着，星期六詹姆斯驾车带着主人逛了城里好多地方，我们穿过好多奇妙的大街，那感觉真棒。正当火车要进站时，主人确定要去火车站，出租马车、载客马车、轻便送货马车和公共马车都在设法过桥。铁路铃响起时，只有好马和好车夫才能过去，因为桥很窄，去火车站还有一个急转弯，如果你眼睛不尖或脑筋不灵，就容易跟其他车辆发生碰撞。





第十五章　老马夫


之后，男主人和女主人决定去拜访住在距离我们家大约四十六英里的几位朋友，这次由詹姆斯驾车。第一天，我们行驶了三十二英里。其中有一些漫长难走的山路，但是詹姆斯驾驶得小心周到，所以我们一点儿也不觉得疲倦。下山时，他绝不会忘记拉住刹车，也不会忘记在适当的地段松开刹车。他总是让我们踩到最平坦的地方。如果上山的路很长，他就让马车轮子稍微横过马路，以免马车向后滑，也好让我们喘口气。所有这些小事都会帮马儿的大忙，尤其是在善言劝诱的前提下。

我们在路上停了一两次。正当太阳要落下时，我们来到了要过夜的那个小镇。我们在集市最大的旅馆前停下来。那是一个很大的旅馆，我们经过一个拱门，进入一个长长的院子，最远端是马厩和车房。两个马夫过来给我们解笼头。打头的是一个小个子，瘸了一条腿，穿着一件黄条纹马甲，和颜悦色，积极能干。我从来没有见过解马具像他这么快的人。他轻轻地拍了拍我，说了一句好话，就把我牵进了一个长马厩，里面有六至八个畜栏和两三匹马。另一个人牵来了姜姐。我们接受刷洗时，詹姆斯站在旁边。

我从来没有被谁像那个小老头那样又轻又快地清洗过。他刷洗完后，詹姆斯走上前把我上下摸了一遍，似乎认为我不可能已被清洗彻底了，但是他发现我的皮毛像丝绸一样光洁。

“好吧，”他说，“我以为自己刷洗得相当快了，我们的约翰比我还快，而你刷得既快又彻底，胜过了我见过的所有马夫。”

“熟能生巧，”那个瘸腿的马夫说，“如果没有达到熟能生巧，那就惭愧了。干了四十年，再不生巧！哈，哈！那就太惭愧了。说到快，啊，上帝保佑你！那只是一种习惯。如果你养成快的习惯，那就跟慢一样容易。我应该说，比慢更容易。事实上，如果我在一件事上拖拖拉拉，需要用两倍的时间，那我的健康状况也不允许。上帝保佑！我可不能像某些人那样磨磨蹭蹭吹着口哨干活！你明白，从十二岁起，我就跟马打交道，不是在狩猎马厩就是在赛马饲养训练场。你明白，因为个子小，我还当了好几年赛马骑师。但是，在古德伍德，你明白，草皮很滑，可怜的‘飞燕’摔倒了，我的膝盖摔伤了，所以我当然在那儿派不上用场了。而没有马，我活不下去，肯定活不下去，所以我就来到了旅馆。我可以告诉你，照管这样有教养、有礼貌、讨人喜欢的动物完全是一件快事。上帝保佑你！我可以看出一匹马受的是何等的待遇。给我二十分钟照管马儿，我就能告诉你这马儿有着什么样的马夫。看这匹马儿，可爱、安分，你要他怎么转，他就怎么转，他抬起蹄子接受清洗，或者说，你让他做什么，他就乐意做什么。然后，你会发现另一匹马，不安、烦躁，不愿走正道。或者你一接近他，他就在马厩那端抬起头，垂下耳朵，好像怕你。要不，就是用蹄后跟摆出要攻击你的样子。可怜的东西！我知道他们有过何种待遇。如果本性腼腆，他们就会易受惊或畏缩。如果本性骁勇，他们就会凶猛可怕。他们的脾气大都是小时候养成的。上帝保佑你！他们就像孩子一样，正如《圣经》所说，应该按章法训练好他们，他们长大后，即使遇到考验，也不会背离那脾气。”

“我喜欢听你说话，”詹姆斯说，“我们在家里就是这样做的，是在我们主人家。”

“你家主人是谁，小伙子？如果方便问的话。据我所见，我应该能断定他是一个好主人。”

“他是灯塔山那边伯特维克庄园的戈登先生。”詹姆斯说。

“啊！原来是这样，我听人说起过他。他相马很准，不是吗？是郡里最好的骑手。”

“我相信他是。”詹姆斯说，“但是，自从我们可怜的小主人夭折以来，他就骑得很少了。”

“啊！可怜的先生。当时我从报纸上全都看到了。还有一匹好马也毙了命，是吗？”

“是的，”詹姆斯说，“那可是一匹骏马，就是这匹骏马的兄弟，长得很像他。”

“可惜！可惜啊！”老人说，“如果我记得没错的话，那个地方不适合马儿跳跃。一道稀疏的栅栏挡在高处，陡峭的河堤下面就是小溪，不是吗？马儿不可能看到他的去向。现在，我还是跟所有男人一样赞成大胆去骑。不过，我仍然认为，有些跳跃只有心领神会的老猎手才能做到。一个人和一匹马的生命比狐狸尾巴值钱。至少，我应该说是这样。”

此时，另一个人已经为姜姐洗完了，给我们端来了谷物。随后，詹姆斯和那位老人一起离开了马厩。





第十六章　大火


那天晚上晚些时候，另一个马夫牵进了旅客的一匹马。他正在给马刷洗时，一个嘴里叼着烟斗的年轻人漫步走进了马厩。

“我说，托勒，”马夫说，“请爬上梯子，到阁楼上拿一些干草，铺在这匹马的饲料架上，好吗？不过，要把烟斗放下。”

“好吧。”那个人说着就钻过活板门上去了，我听到他走过头顶的地板，把干草拿了下来。最后，詹姆斯进来看了我们一眼，就锁上了门。

我说不清我睡了多久，也说不清是夜里几点钟了，但是我感到很不舒服，就醒来了，尽管我几乎不知道为什么。我站起来。空气似乎浓烈而呛鼻。我听见姜姐在咳嗽，另一匹马儿好像也焦躁不安。四周漆黑，我什么也看不见，马厩却仿佛浓烟滚滚，我几乎不知道如何喘气。

活板门是开着的，我想烟是从那个地方钻过来的。我侧耳倾听，听到了一阵轻柔而急促的响声以及低沉的噼啪声和断裂声。我不知道那是什么声音，但那声音中有一种奇怪的魔力让我浑身颤抖。其他马儿也都醒了。有的在扯缰绳，有的在跺脚。

最后，我听到了外面的脚步声，那个之前牵旅客的马进来的马夫提着灯笼冲进了马厩，他开始解马缰，想设法把马儿都牵出去。但是，他好像慌里慌张的，自己都被吓坏了，这让我更加恐惧。第一匹马不愿跟他走，于是他设法牵第二匹和第三匹，但他们也不愿挪动。接下来，他又来到我的身边，想设法用力把我拽出马厩，当然也无济于事。他轮流拉遍了我们所有的马儿，之后就离开了马厩。

毫无疑问，我们都非常愚蠢，但是似乎到处都是危险，我们知道没有人值得信任，一切都陌生、无常。透过敞开的门钻进来的新鲜空气使我们的呼吸变得容易了些，而头顶的呼啸声却越来越响。我抬起头来，透过空架上的木杠看到一道红光在墙上一闪一闪的，然后我听到外面有人喊“着火了！”。那个老马夫平静而又迅速地走进来，把一匹马拉出去，然后又去拉另一匹。火焰却在活板门上蔓延，头上的呼啸声真可怕。

接下来，我听到了詹姆斯的声音，像以往那样从容、愉快。

“来，我的美人儿们，我们该离开这儿了，醒一下，跟我来。”我站得离门最近，所以他先来到我的身边，进来时轻轻地拍了拍我。

“来，美人儿，戴上笼头，我的宝贝儿，我们马上离开这个憋闷的地方。”刻不容缓，于是他从脖子上摘下围巾，轻轻地扎在我的眼睛上，一边拍一边哄地把我牵出了马厩。等我们安全到达了院中，他解下我眼睛上的围巾，大声喊道：“来人！牵走这匹马，我去救另一匹。”

一个高大魁梧的男子走上前拉住我，詹姆斯又冲回了马厩。我望着他离去，发出了一声嘶叫。后来姜姐告诉我说，我的那声嘶叫是我能为她做的最好的事儿，因为如果她没有听到我在外面，她是绝不会有勇气走出来的。

院子里乱成了一锅粥。马儿们正从其他马厩被纷纷放出来，四轮马车和双轮马车也正被拉到房子和棚子外面，以免火势蔓延。院子另一头的窗户也被统统打开了，人们喊着各种各样的话，而我始终盯着马厩门，那儿冒出来的烟比之前更浓了，我还能看见红光闪现。不一会儿，我听到一个响亮清澈的声音，它盖过了所有的骚乱声和喧嚣声，我知道那是主人的声音：

“詹姆斯·霍华德！詹姆斯·霍华德！你在那儿吗？”没有回音，但是我听到马厩里有东西坠落的碰撞声。接下来，我发出一声响亮、快乐的嘶鸣，因为我看到詹姆斯正牵着姜姐穿过浓烟向我们走来。姜姐在剧烈地咳嗽，詹姆斯也说不出话来了。

“我勇敢的小伙子！”主人把手放在他的肩上说，“你受伤了吗？”

詹姆斯摇了摇头，因为他还说不出话来。

“唉，”那个扶住我的大个子说，“他是一个勇敢的小伙子，没错。”

“好了，”主人说，“詹姆斯，等你喘过气来后，我们尽快离开这个地方。”说着，我们向门口走去，这时集市上传来了一阵飞奔的马蹄声和隆隆的车轮声。

“消防车来了！消防车来了！”两三个声音喊道，“往后站，让让路！”只见两匹马拉着一辆沉重的消防车冲进了院子，碾得石头发出了隆隆的响声。消防员纵身跳到了地上。没必要问哪儿发生了火灾——火焰巨大，正从屋顶熊熊升起。

我们尽快出去，来到了宽阔寂静的市场上；繁星闪烁，除了我们后面的喧闹声之外，万籁俱寂。主人领着我们去了另一侧的大旅馆。马夫一出来，主人就说道：“詹姆斯，我现在必须赶到女主人那儿去。我把这些马儿全权委托给你，你需要什么，就吩咐马夫去做。”说完，他就走了。主人没有跑，但是我从来没有见过哪个凡人像他那天夜里走得那么快。

我们还没有走进马厩，就听到了一种可怕的声音。是那些留在马厩里快要被活活烧死的可怜的马儿的尖叫声——那可怕极了！这使我和姜姐都很难过。不过，我们被带进了马厩，得到了善待。

第二天早晨，主人过来看我们怎么样了，他跟詹姆斯说话。我没有听到多少，因为马夫正在给我彻底梳刷，但是我看得出詹姆斯喜气扬扬的，我想主人很为他骄傲。我们的女主人夜里受到了极大的惊吓，所以旅行被推迟到了下午，这样詹姆斯上午就有了空闲。他先去那家旅馆查看我们的马具和马车，然后去打听火灾的更多情况。他回来后，我们听到他向马夫讲明了原委。起初，没有人想到大火是怎么引起的，但是最后有个人说他看见迪克·托勒嘴里叼着烟斗走进了马厩，出来时嘴里的烟斗就没有了，他又去酒吧点了一只。随后，那个打下手的马夫说他请迪克爬上梯子拿下了一些干草，但吩咐迪克先放下烟斗。迪克不承认自己叼着烟斗，但是没有人相信他。我还记得我们约翰·曼利的规矩，绝不允许马厩里有烟斗，所以我认为这应该是所有地方的规矩。

詹姆斯说屋顶和地板都塌了，只有那些黑墙立着。有两匹可怜的马儿没能逃脱，被埋在了烧塌的房椽和碎瓦下面。





第十七章　约翰·曼利的一席话


我们余下的旅程都非常轻松，太阳刚落一小会儿，我们就到达了主人的朋友家里。我们被带进了一个干净、温暖、舒适的马厩。那儿有一个善良的马夫，他让我们舒舒服服的。他听说那场火灾后，好像十分欣赏詹姆斯。

“有一件事儿显而易见，年轻人，”他说，“你的马儿知道谁可以信任。世上最难做的事情之一就是，在发生火灾或洪灾时，把马儿从马厩里牵出来。我不知道他们为什么不出来，但是他们就是不愿出来——只有不到二十分之一的马儿愿意。”

我们在这个地方逗留了两三天，然后就回家了。一路上都很顺利。我们都很高兴又回到了自己的马厩，约翰见到我们同样也很高兴。

在他和詹姆斯离开我们去过夜之前，詹姆斯说道：“我想知道谁会来接替我的位置。”

“住在森林小屋的小乔·格林。”约翰说。

“小乔·格林！啊，他还是一个孩子！”

“他十四岁半了。”约翰说。

“可是，他是这样一个小家伙。”

“是的，他很小，却反应敏捷，心甘情愿，心地也善良，再说他也很想来，他的爸爸也这样想。我知道主人想给他这个机会。他说，如果我认为他做不了，他就会物色一个大一点儿的男孩子。但是，我说我非常乐意试用他六周。”

“六周！”詹姆斯说，“啊，要六个月他才能派上大用场！那会让你大费周折的，约翰。”

“啊，”约翰笑着说道，“我和工作是很好的朋友。我还从来没有怕过干活儿呢。”

“你是一个大好人，”詹姆斯说，“我希望自己能成为你那样的人。”

“我通常不谈我自己的事，”约翰说，“但是，既然你要离开我们到大千世界去脱胎换骨，我就想告诉你，我是怎么看待这些事的。我只有约瑟夫这么大的时候，我的爸爸和妈妈十天内相继死于高烧，只留下了我和瘸腿的妹妹奈丽在这个世界上，我们没有一个亲戚可以投奔。我是农夫的孩子，赚不到足够的钱养活自己，更不要说养活我们俩了。要不是我们的女主人（奈丽把女主人称为她的天使，而且她完全有理由这样叫），我的妹妹一定早就去贫民习艺所了。女主人给她和玛勒寡妇租了一个房间，还给她一些力所能及的编织或针线活。她生病时，女主人还给她送饭，给她送好多漂亮舒适的东西，就像妈妈一样照顾她。而主人则把我带到了马厩，在当时的老马夫诺曼手下干活。我在屋里吃饭，在阁楼上睡觉，还有一套衣服，每周三个先令，这样我就能帮助奈丽了。当时还有诺曼。像他这个年龄，本可以转过身说：我不希望被一个只会在耕犁后面瞎跑的毛孩子打扰，而他却像爸爸一样对我，为我没完没了地受苦。几年后，老人家死了，我就接替了他的位置。所以现在我不仅工资最高，而且雨天或晴天都可以休息，奈丽也快乐得像一只小鸟。所以，你看，詹姆斯，我不是那种瞧不起小男孩、惹我们好心的主人生气的人。不，不是！詹姆斯，我会非常想念你，但是我们会渡过难关，当你受到阻碍时，没有比行善更好的事儿了，所以我很高兴我能这样做。”

“这么说，”詹姆斯说，“你不同意‘人不为己，天诛地灭’这句话了？”

“确实不同意。”约翰说，“如果男主人、女主人和老诺曼都是只顾自身利益，那我和奈丽现在会在哪儿？啊，她在贫民习艺所，而我在挖萝卜！如果你只想着自身利益，黑骏马和姜姐会在哪儿呢？啊，已经被大火烤死喽！不，吉姆，不！不管谁用那句话，那都是自私野蛮的说法。如果他只顾想着自己的利益，那么，他在睁开眼睛之前，没有像小狗或小猫那样被溺死，我只会觉得真遗憾，这就是我的想法。”约翰非常坚定地仰了一下头说。

听到这个，詹姆斯呵呵笑了起来。但是，他说话时的声音有一种厚重感：“除了我的妈妈之外，你是我最好的朋友。我希望你不要忘记我。”

“不会，伙计，不会！”约翰说，“如果有可能我一定帮你。我希望你不会忘记我。”

第二天，在詹姆斯离开之前，乔来到了马厩，尽可能学习他所有的一切。他学会了清扫马厩，抱进稻草和干草。他开始清扫马具，帮助清洗马车。他个子太矮，无法照看我和姜姐，詹姆斯就在快乐腿身上给他示范，因为乔要在约翰手下做事，快乐腿就要完全归他管。他是一个聪明可爱的小家伙，总是吹着口哨来干活。

快乐腿对自己被一个他所说的“一无所知的男孩子”“笨手笨脚地拉来拉去”大为生气。但是，两周快结束时，他悄悄地告诉我说，他认为这个小家伙一定会有出息。

詹姆斯不得不离开我们的日子终于到了。尽管他看上去像以往一样快乐，但是那天早晨他心事重重。

“你明白，”他对约翰说，“我要撇下好多好多。我的妈妈和贝特西，还有你，好心的男主人和女主人，以及这些马和我的老快乐腿。到了新地方，我不认识任何人。要不是我会得到一个更高的职位，能更好地帮助我的妈妈，我想我是不会下定决心去那儿的。这真难受啊，约翰。”

“唉，詹姆斯，小伙子，就是这样。如果你第一次离开家没有这种感觉，我是不会器重你的。打起精神，你在那儿会交到朋友的。如果你过得好——你一定会的——那对你的妈妈来说也是一件好事。她会为你去那样一个好地方而骄傲。”

约翰就这样为他加油，但是人人都为要失去詹姆斯而难过。至于快乐腿，在詹姆斯走后好几天，都神情憔悴，完全没有了食欲。于是，好几个早上约翰在训练我时也用一根引领缰绳把他牵出来，让他在我身边小跑和飞奔，这使小家伙又振作了起来，很快他就没事了。

乔的父亲经常过来帮点儿小忙，因为他懂得这项工作。乔非常努力地学习，约翰也对他倍加鼓励。





第十八章　去请医生


詹姆斯离开几天后的一天夜里，我吃过了干草，正躺在稻草里酣睡，突然马厩里铃声大作，把我惊醒了。我听到约翰的房门打开了，他跑到大厅，很快又折返回来。他打开马厩门的锁，走进来，大声叫道：“醒醒，美人儿！你现在必须保持以往的良好状态。”几乎还没等我来得及想，他就已经把鞍子架到了我的背上，把笼头套到了我的头上。他又跑去拿来了外套，然后一路小跑把我拉到了大厅门口。主人手里提着灯站在那儿。

“好了，约翰，”他说，“为了你的生命——也就是为了女主人的生命——快骑吧，一刻也不能耽误。把这封短信给怀特医生送去。到了旅馆，让马休息一下，尽快赶回。”

约翰说：“是，先生。”随后立刻骑上我的背。住在木屋的园丁听到铃响，早就把门打开了。我们奔出庄园，穿过村子，跑下山，来到了关卡。约翰大声叫喊，咚咚敲门。守门人马上打开了大门。

“好了，”约翰说，“请你把门留着等医生，钱给你。”说完，他便又走了。

我们面前有一条漫长平坦的沿河路。约翰对我说：“现在，美人儿，尽力跑吧。”我就尽力跑了起来。我不需要鞭子，也不需要马刺，尽可能快地飞奔了两英里，我相信就是我赢得过纽马克特比赛的老爷爷当时也不可能跑得比我快。当我们来到桥边时，约翰稍微勒住了我，拍了拍我的脖子，“做得不错，美人儿！好伙计，”他说。他本想让我跑慢些，但是我精神抖擞，于是又像先前一样飞奔而去。空气寒冷，月光明亮，非常舒适。我们先是经过一个村子，然后穿过一片黑树林，接下来上山下山，跑了八英里之后，来到了镇上。我们穿过街道，到达集市。万籁俱寂，只有我踩在石头上发出的嘚嘚声——大家都睡着了。我们来到怀特医生家门口时，教堂的钟敲了三下。约翰拉了两次门铃，然后如响雷一般敲门。一扇窗户打开了，怀特医生戴着睡帽伸出头，问道：“你想干吗？”

“戈登夫人病重了，先生。主人想要你马上去。他认为，如果你不能赶到那儿，她就会死。这里有封短信。”

“等一下，”他说，“我这就来。”

他关上窗户，很快就出现在了门口。

“最糟糕的是，”他说，“我的马出去了一天，早已筋疲力尽了。我的儿子也刚被叫出去，他带走了另一匹马。怎么办呢？我可以骑你的马吗？”

“先生，他这一路差不多都在飞奔。我本想让他在这儿休息一下。但是，我想，如果你认为合适，我们的主人就不会反对，先生。”

“好了，”他说，“我很快就准备好了。”

约翰站在我的身边，抚摸我的脖子。我很热。医生拿着马鞭出来了。

“先生，这你不用带，”约翰说，“黑骏马会一直跑到他趴下为止。先生，尽可能照顾他。我不想让他受到任何伤害。”

“不，不会，约翰，”医生说，“我希望不会。”我们立刻就把约翰远远地抛在了身后。

我不愿说回程那段路。医生比约翰重，也不是一个好骑手。不过，我竭尽全力。关卡的那个人还留着门。当我们来到山边时，医生让我停下来，“好了，我的好伙计，”他说，“歇口气吧。”我很高兴他这样做，因为我快筋疲力尽了，那次歇息后，我继续前进，我们很快就到达了庄园。乔站在木屋门口，我的主人站在大厅门口，因为他已经听到我们来了。他没有说一句话，医生跟着他走进屋子，乔把我牵进了马厩。我很高兴回到了家里。我的腿在身下哆嗦，我只能站在那儿喘息。我身上没有一根干毛，汗水顺着我的腿流下来，我浑身冒着热气，乔以前常常说，我就像炉子上的水壶一样。可怜的乔！他还年小，知之甚少，他的父亲本来可以帮他，却被派到邻村去了。但是，我相信他已经竭尽全力做了自己知道的事儿。他揉着我的腿和胸，他却没有给我盖上暖布。他认为我这么热，一定不喜欢暖布。随后，他给了我一桶水喝。水很冷，很好喝，我全都把它喝完了。接着，他又给了我一些干草和谷物，以为自己干得不错，就走了。不久，我就开始颤抖和战栗，浑身冰冷。我的腿疼，我的腰疼，我的胸疼，我感到浑身都疼。噢！当我站在那儿打战时，我是多么想要那块温暖的厚布啊！我想要约翰，而他要步行八英里才能到这里，于是我躺在稻草里设法让自己入睡。过了好一阵子，我听见约翰来到了门口。我发出了一声低沉的呻吟，因为我非常痛苦。他立刻来到我的身边，弯下腰。尽管我无法把自己的感受告诉他，但是他似乎明白这一切。他给我盖了两三块暖布，然后跑到屋里，端来一些热水。他给我做了一些热粥让我喝，随后我想我就睡着了。

约翰似乎大为恼火。我听到他在一遍又一遍地自言自语道：“笨小子！笨小子！居然没有盖布，我敢说水也是冷的。男孩子真没用。”不过，乔毕竟是一个好孩子。

我现在病得很重，肺部严重感染，呼吸起来都很痛苦。约翰夜以继日地照料我。为了来看我，他夜里要起来两三次。我的主人也经常来看我。“我可怜的美人儿，”有一天，主人对我说，“我的好马儿，你救了女主人的命，美人儿。是的，是你救了她的命。”听到这话，我很高兴，因为好像医生也说过，如果我们再耽搁时间长点儿，就为时已晚了。约翰告诉主人说，他这一生从来没有见过跑得这么快的马儿。这匹马儿好像知道发生了什么事儿。我当然知道，尽管约翰不这样想。至少，我差不多知道——我和约翰必须以最快的速度奔跑，这都是为了女主人。





第十九章　只怪无知


我不知道自己病了多久。马医邦德先生每天都来。有一天，他给我放血治疗，约翰接了一桶。之后，我感觉很晕，以为自己要死了，我相信他们也都是这样想的。

姜姐和快乐腿都被移到了别的马厩，这样我就可以静养了，因为发烧让我的听觉非常灵敏，任何一点儿风吹草动在我听来都格外响亮。我能听得出从房子里走进走出的每个人的脚步声，我知道发生的一切。一天夜里，约翰不得不给我吃药，托马斯·格林进来帮他。我吃过药后，约翰尽可能让我舒服些，他说他会在这儿待半小时看药效如何。托马斯说要陪着他，于是他们就到安放在快乐腿马厩里的长凳上坐下，把灯笼放在他们的脚边，这样我就不会受到光线打扰了。

两人静静地坐了一会儿，随后托马斯·格林低声说道：

“约翰，我希望你能对乔说点儿好话。那个孩子伤心欲裂，他既吃不下饭，也不会笑了。他说，他知道这都是他的过错，尽管他确信自己已经尽力了。他说，如果美人儿死了，没有人会再对他说话。听到他这样说，我真伤心。我想你就跟他说句话吧，他不是一个坏孩子。”

停了一会儿，约翰慢慢地说道：“你不能对我这样苛刻，汤姆。我知道他无意造成伤害，我从来没有说过他是故意的。我知道他不是个坏孩子。不过，你明白，我自己也很痛苦。那匹马是我内心的骄傲，更不要说他是男主人和女主人的心肝宝贝了。一想到他的生命可能会以这种方式被夺去，我真受不了。但是，如果你认为我对那个男孩子苛刻，明天我会尽力对他说句好话——也就是说，如果美人儿好转的话。”

“好的，约翰，谢谢你。我就知道你不希望自己过于苛刻。我很高兴你明白这仅仅是无知。”

约翰回答时的声音差点儿吓了我一跳：

“仅仅是无知！仅仅是无知！你怎么能说这仅仅是无知呢？你不知道这是世界上仅次于邪恶的最坏的事儿吗？只有上天知道无知造成的最严重伤害。如果有人能说出：‘噢！我不知道，我没有任何恶意。’他们觉得这就没事了。我想，玛莎·穆尔沃什开伤风合剂和起镇定作用的糖浆时，并不想杀死那个婴儿，而她的确害死了那个婴儿，因杀人罪受到了审判。”

“她也是罪有应得，”汤姆说，“如果一个女人不知道什么对婴儿有益，什么对婴儿有害，就不该去护理一个娇嫩的小孩子。”

约翰继续说道：“比尔·斯塔基扮成鬼在月光下追他的弟弟，并不想把弟弟吓得魂飞魄散，但是他那样做了。那个聪明英俊的小伙子本来可以成为任何一位母亲心中的骄傲，现在却成了一个白痴，即使他活到八十岁，也绝不会像从前那样聪明了。你自己也深受其害，汤姆。两周前，那些小姐敞开你的温室门，结果一阵严寒的东风正好刮进来。你说，那场风冻死了你的好多植物。”

“好多！”汤姆说，“嫁接的嫩枝条没有一个不被吹折。我不得不再插一遍，最糟糕的是，我都不知道去哪儿找新鲜枝条。当我进来看到她们做的一切时，都快疯了。”

“但是，”约翰说，“我肯定那些小姐不是存心的，那仅仅是无知！”

我没有再听见这番谈话，因为药效良好，让我睡着了。到了第二天早上，我感觉好多了。而当我最终更多地了解了这个世界时，我常常想起约翰说的这番话。





第二十章　乔·格林


乔·格林进展良好。他学得很快，体贴周到，约翰在好多事情上开始信任他了。而正如我所说，他的个子在那个年龄显得矮小，所以他很少能获准来训练我或姜姐。但是，碰巧一天早上，约翰赶着正义拉着行李车出去了，主人想要把一封短信马上送到大约三英里远的一位先生的家里，就吩咐乔给我套上马鞍，把短信送去，同时告诫乔骑马时要小心。

送过短信后，我们静静地走在返程路上。路过砖厂时，我们看到一辆满载砖块的马车，轮子死死地卡在了硬泥地深深的车辙里。马夫大喊大叫着，毫不留情地抽打那两匹马。乔停住了脚步。那真是一幅悲惨的景象。两匹马竭尽全力绷紧身体要把马车拉出来，但是就是拉不动。他们的腿和侧腹都像小溪般流着汗，身体的两边起伏着，每块肌肉都绷紧了，而那个男人却凶神恶煞般地拽着前面那匹马的头，破口大骂，极其野蛮地抽打他们。

“别打了，”乔说，“别再那样抽打这些马了。车轮陷得太深了，他们拉不出来。”那个人毫不理会，继续抽打。

“停下！请停下！”乔说，“我来帮你卸车。现在他们拉不动。”

“管好你自己的事儿，你这个无礼的小坏蛋，我会管好自己的事儿！”那个人正在气头上，更糟糕的是还借着酒劲儿，又将鞭子甩了下来。乔调转我的头，接着我们朝砖石场主人的家全速奔去。我不敢说约翰是不是会同意我们这样跑，我和乔的想法却是一样的，我们都非常生气，所以不可能慢慢腾腾地走。

房子就在路边。乔敲了敲门，大声喊道：“喂！克莱先生在家吗？”门打开了，克莱先生本人走了出来。

“你好，年轻人！你好像很急。主人今天早上有什么吩咐吗？”

“没有，克莱先生，而你的砖厂里却有一个家伙要把两匹马打死了。我让他住手，他不愿住手。我说我愿帮他卸车，他也不愿意。所以，我就来告诉你。先生，请你去一趟吧。”乔的声音因激动而颤抖。

“谢谢你，小伙子，”那个人说着就跑去拿帽子，接着又停了一下，“如果我把那个家伙送到法官那儿，你愿意出庭作证吗？”

“我愿意，”乔说，“也很乐意。”那个人走后，我们就步伐矫健地走在了回家的路上。

“啊，乔，你出了什么事儿？看上去你非常生气。”当这个男孩子从马鞍上跳下时，约翰问。

“我非常生气，我可以告诉你。”说着，男孩子用急切兴奋的话语把发生的一切都告诉了约翰。乔通常是一个文静温和的小家伙，所以看到他被这样激怒，真是让人惊奇。

“对，乔！不管那家伙收没收到传票，你都做得对，我的孩子。好多人都会骑过去，说这不是他们应该干涉的事儿。现在我要说，如果看到有人虐待和压迫，每个人都应该干涉。你做得对，我的孩子。”

此时，乔镇定自如，约翰的赞赏让他自豪。于是，他给我擦蹄子和身体时，手比以往更加坚定有力。

乔和约翰刚要离开马厩回去吃饭，这时男仆来到了马厩，他说主人要乔立即去他的房间。有人被指控虐待马匹，他们需要乔的证词。乔满脸红光，两眼熠熠生辉。“他们会得到证据的。”他说。

“你把自己收拾齐整点儿。”约翰说。乔拉了拉领带，拽了拽夹克，立刻就去了。我们的主人作为郡里的地方法官之一，经常会有案子送给他审理，或者由他说应该怎么判。在马厩里，我们有一段时间都没有再听到什么，因为那是人们吃饭的时间，而当乔又回到马厩时，我看到他兴致高昂，他和善地拍了拍我，说道：“我们再也不会看到这种事儿发生了，对吗，老伙计？”后来，我们听说他非常清晰地提供了证据，那两匹马当时是那样筋疲力尽，身上留下了受虐待的累累伤痕，结果马夫受到了审判，有可能被判两三个月监禁。

乔身上发生这么大的变化，真是喜人。约翰哈哈大笑，说乔那一周长高了一英寸，我相信他已经长高了。他还是像以前那样善良温和，而他做任何事情都更加意志坚定了——好像他一下子从男孩子变成了男子汉。





第二十一章　分别


如今，我已经在这个快乐的地方生活了三年，而凄惨的变化即将来到我们身边。我们不时地听到夫人生病的消息。医生经常来家里，看上去主人神情沉重忧虑。后来，我们听说，夫人必须马上离开家，去一个温暖的国家待两三年。全家人听到这个消息，就像听到丧钟一样。大家都很难过。但是，主人立即就开始着手安排变卖家产离开英国的事儿了。我们经常在马厩里听到人们谈论这个话题。实际上，他们不再提别的话题了。

约翰工作时沉默伤感，乔几乎也不吹口哨了。有好多事儿需要来来回回跑腿，我和姜姐满负荷工作。

第一批走的是杰西小姐和弗罗拉小姐，还有她们的女家庭教师。她们过来跟我们道别。像老朋友一样拥抱了可怜的快乐腿，他的确是她们的老朋友。后来，我们听说了主人对我们的安排。主人把我和姜姐卖给了他的老朋友W勋爵，因为他认为我们在那儿会有一个好归宿。他把快乐腿送给了牧师，那个牧师正为布罗姆菲尔德夫人找一匹小马，而主人的条件是他们永远不能卖掉快乐腿，等他干不动活后，就开枪射杀并埋葬他。

乔应邀照顾快乐腿，帮衬家事，所以我认为快乐腿过得不错。约翰受到好几个好地方的聘请，他却说他还是再等一等、看一看。

他们离开的前一晚，主人走进马厩来给一些叮嘱，也来给他的马儿们最后的爱抚。他似乎情绪非常低落。我能通过他的声音知道这一点。我相信我们马儿比好多人都更能心领神会。

“你已经决定做什么了吗，约翰？”他问，“我发现你没有接受任何聘请。”

“没有，先生。我已经下定决心了，如果我能得到一个跟一流的幼马调教师和驯马师一样的工作，那对我来说是再恰当不过的事了。好多幼马因受到不当的对待而受惊和受伤，如果有合适的人训练他们，就不会有这种事儿了。我总是跟马儿相处得很好，如果我能帮助他们中的一些拥有一个良好的开端，我就会认为自己像是在做善事。你对此有什么看法，先生？”

“我不知道哪儿有这样的人，”主人说，“我想你再合适不过了。你懂马，不晓得什么缘故，马也懂你，你最后会自立门户。我想你的打算再好不过了。如果有任何我可以帮你的地方，就给我写信。我会交代我驻伦敦的代理人，并向他推荐你。”

主人把代理人的姓名和地址告诉了约翰，然后对他长期忠诚的服务表示感谢。这可让约翰承受不起。“求你别说了，先生，我担待不起。你和夫人为我做了这么多，我永远都无法报答。但是，先生，我们永远不会忘记你，如有可能的话，我们有朝一日就会重新看到夫人回来。我们必须心存希望，先生。”主人跟约翰握了握手，却没有说话，他们俩离开了马厩。

悲伤的一天终于来了。男仆和那些重行李前一天已经走了，只剩下主人、夫人和她的女仆。我和姜姐最后一次把马车拉到了大厅门口。仆人从屋里取出了垫子、旅行毛毯和好多其他东西。当一切都安排好后，主人抱着夫人走下楼梯（我就在房子旁边，所以能看到发生的一切）。他小心翼翼地把她放进马车，家仆们都围站在马车四周失声痛哭。

“再见，”他说，“我们不会忘记你们任何人。”说着，他坐进车里——“发车吧，约翰。”

乔跳上车，我们慢慢地小跑着驶出庄园，穿过村子，村里人都站在家门口看主人他们最后一眼，说道：“上帝保佑他们。”

我们到达火车站时，我想夫人下了马车，走到了候车室。我听到她用自己独有的甜美声音说道：“再见，约翰。上帝保佑你。”我感到缰绳骤然一抽，约翰却没有应答，也许他说不出话来。乔刚把马车上的东西卸下来，约翰就让他站在马儿旁边，他则上了月台。可怜的乔！他靠近我们的脑袋站在那儿，遮掩自己的眼泪。火车很快就喷着蒸汽进站了，两三分钟后，车门砰地关上，列车员吹响了哨子，火车滑行而去，只留下了一团团白烟和几颗十分沉重的心。

等完全看不见火车后，约翰才回来。

“我们再也见不到她了，”他说，“再也见不到了。”他拿起缰绳，坐上驾驶座，跟乔一起慢慢地驾车回家，而现在那已经不是我们的家了。





第二部





第二十二章　伯爵府


第二天早饭后，乔把快乐腿套进夫人那辆低矮的轻便马车，要赶他到牧师家去。乔先来跟我们道别，快乐腿从院子里向我们嘶叫了一声。之后，约翰给姜姐套上马鞍，给我套上牵引缰绳，驾着我们越过田野，走了大概十五英里，来到了伯爵府庄园，这就是W伯爵生活的地方。那是一座非常漂亮的房子，有好多马厩。我们穿过石门，走进院子。约翰求见约克先生。过了一段时间，约克先生才出来。他是一个相貌英俊的中年男人，他的声音立刻透露出他期望别人服从他。他对约翰非常友好，彬彬有礼。他微微看了我和姜姐一眼后，叫一个马夫把我们牵到了马厩，然后邀请约翰去吃点心。

我们被牵到了一个明亮通风的马厩，并被安置在了相邻的两个畜栏里，在那儿接受刷洗和喂食。大约半小时后，约翰和即将成为我们新马夫的约克先生进来看我们。

“那么，曼利先生，”他在仔细相看过我俩后说，“我看这两匹马没有任何毛病。不过，我们都知道，马儿也像人一样有自己的特性，有时他们需要不同的待遇。我想知道，这两匹马有没有什么你想提的特别之处？”

“噢，”约翰说，“我相信，在乡下再也找不出比这两匹马更好的一对搭档了。要跟他们分开，我真伤心，而他们并非一模一样。那匹黑马是我见过的性情最好的马儿。我想，他从小时候起就从来不知道什么是难听的话、什么是殴打，他所有的乐趣好像就是做你想要做的事儿。不过，我想，那匹红棕马以前一定受过虐待。我们从马贩子那儿也听到了好多。她刚来时暴躁多疑，而当她发现我们这儿是何种地方时，她的坏脾气就渐渐地消失了。我三年都没有见她有过一丁点儿发脾气的迹象。如果好好对她，就再没有比她更出色、更顺从的动物了。但是，她天生比那匹黑马更易怒。同样面对苍蝇，她比黑马更烦躁，同样面对有哪儿不舒服的马具她也比黑马更焦急。如果被虐待或受到不公正待遇，她肯定会针锋相对。你知道好多骁勇的马儿都会这样做。”

“当然，”约克说，“我完全理解。不过，你知道，在这样的马厩里，要让所有马夫都以恰当的方式工作并不容易。我会尽全力。我必须走了。你对那匹母马的介绍，我会记住的。”

他们正要离开马厩，这时约翰停下来，说道：“我最好提一下，我们从来不给这两匹马用勒马缰绳。黑马从来没有戴过，马贩子说过，衔铁搞坏了另一匹马的脾气。”

“好了，”约克说，“如果他们来这儿，那就必须戴勒马缰绳。我自己喜欢放松缰绳，主人总是对马儿通情达理。但是，我家夫人——则是另一回事。她喜欢时尚，如果她的拉车马没有紧紧地勒高马头，她就不会看他们一眼。我总是反对给马戴衔铁，还会继续反对，而夫人骑马时，则必须勒高系牢！”

“我对此表示遗憾，非常遗憾。”约翰说，“但是，我现在必须走了，否则我就赶不上火车了。”

他绕过来，逐一走到我们的身边，最后一次拍了拍我们，对我们说了说话，他的声音听上去非常悲伤。

我把脸凑向他，我只能这样做来道别。随后，他就走了，我从此再也没有见过他。

第二天，W勋爵来看我们，他好像对我们的外表非常满意。

“我对这两匹马大有信心，”他说，“我的朋友戈登先生已经向我介绍过他们的性格。当然，他们在毛色上并不搭配，而我的想法是，他们在乡下拉拉马车倒是挺不错。在去伦敦之前，我必须设法找一匹跟男爵搭配的马儿。我相信，驾那匹黑马再合适不过了。”

于是，约克把约翰对他说的关于我们的信息都告诉了他。

“好吧，”他说，“你一定要留意那匹母马，让导向缰绳放松。我敢说，开始时稍微迁就一下，他们会做得非常出色。这事儿我会对夫人说的。”

下午，我们被戴上了马具，套上了马车。马厩里的钟刚敲了三下，我们就被牵着绕到了房子前面。房子都非常宽大，有伯特维克庄园老房子的三四倍大。但是，如果马儿可以发表意见的话，那就是，不如以前庄园的一半惬意。两个男仆穿着土褐色制服、鲜红色马裤和白色长袜，站在那儿严阵以待。

不一会儿，我们就听到了夫人走下石阶楼梯时传来的丝绸裙的飒飒声。她绕圈打量了我们一番。她个子高挑，样子傲慢，好像对什么事儿感到不满，却一言不发，直接坐进了马车。这是第一次戴勒马缰绳，我必须说，尽管不能让我的头偶尔低下来确实讨厌，但是它也没有把我的头拉得比我习惯支撑的更高。我为姜姐感到担忧，而她似乎从容满足。

第二天三点钟，我们又来到了门口，还是先前那两个男仆。我们听到了丝绸裙的飒飒声，夫人走下了台阶，以命令的口气说道：“约克，你必须把这些马的脑袋再抬高些，他们让人看着不顺眼。”

约克鞠了一躬，毕恭毕敬地说：“请原谅，夫人，这两匹马可都有三年没上过勒马缰绳了。主人说，为了更安全，还是让他们逐步适应吧。不过，如果您乐意的话，我可以让他们再抬高点儿。”

“就这样做。”她说。

约克绕到我们的头边，亲自把缰绳勒短了些——我想，勒进去了一个孔眼。无论如何，每勒进去一点儿，感觉都会大不一样。那天，我们要爬一段陡峭的山路。这时，我开始明白了我曾经听到过的一切。当然，我想把头往前伸，像以前经常做的那样努力把马车拉上去。但是，不行，我现在不得不抬高脑袋，这让我耗尽了精力，发力全靠背部和腿部。我们到达后，姜姐说：“现在你明白是什么滋味了吧，而这还不算糟。只要情况不会大大恶化，我就什么也不会说，因为我们在这儿受到了优待。但是，如果想紧紧勒高我的头，他们就要当心了！我可受不了，也不愿忍受。”

一天天，一个孔眼一个孔眼，我们的导向缰绳越来越短了，我不再像从前那样愉快地期盼戴上马具了，而是开始害怕它了。姜姐也显得烦躁不安，尽管她话语不多。最后，我想最糟糕的已经结束了，好几天都没有再缩短缰绳，我决定将就着尽职尽责，尽管现在工作成了一种持续不断的伤害，而非快事，但最糟糕的还没有到来。





第二十三章　为自由而战


一天，夫人比平常下来晚了些，丝绸裙的飒飒声比以往更响了。

“赶车去B公爵夫人家。”她说，停了一下后，又说道，“你永远都不打算抬高这些马的脑袋了吗，约克？立刻抬高他们的脑袋，不要让我们再看到这种迁就和胡闹了。”

约克先来到我的身边，马夫站在姜姐的头边。约克把我的脑袋向后拽，把缰绳勒得紧紧的，我都快受不了了。随后，他走到姜姐的身边，姜姐正不耐烦地上下甩头跟嚼子较劲儿，似乎现在她又回到老做派了。她对将要发生的事儿心生妙计，为了收紧缰绳，约克刚把缰绳从鞍环上取下来，她就趁机突然扬起前蹄，后腿立起，狂暴地踢在了约克的鼻子上，踢掉了他的帽子。马夫也差点儿被踢倒。他们俩立即飞奔到她的身前，她却跟他们对抗，继续猛烈前冲，后腿站起，不顾一切地踢蹬。最后，她在我左后腿上踢了一下后，正好踢到了车辕上，摔倒在地。要不是约克迅速坐到她的头上，不让她挣扎，还不知道下一步她会搞什么鬼呢。与此同时，约克大声喊道：“解开黑马！快去拿摇柄，拧掉车辕上的螺丝。如果你们解不开，就来一个人割断这缰绳！”一个男仆跑去拿摇柄，另一个从屋里拿来了刀子。马夫很快就把我从姜姐和马车那儿解救了出来，牵进了畜栏。他刚把我放进去，就跑回了约克那儿。我对发生的一切非常激动。如果说我过去习惯踢人或后腿站立的话，我相信当时我也会那样做，而我从来没有那样做过，所以我就站在那儿生气，腿部疼痛，头仍被紧勒到了鞍环上，无法低头。我万分痛苦，无论是谁第一个靠近我，我都很想踢上一脚。

然而，不久以后，姜姐总算被两个马夫牵了进来，身上被打得青一块紫一块。约克跟她一起来的，他吩咐了几句，然后过来看我。他立刻放下我的头。

“该死的勒马缰绳！”他自言自语说，“我想我们很快就会倒霉了——主人会大为恼火。但是，在这儿，如果女人的丈夫都不能管教她，仆人当然就做不到了。所以，我也洗手不干了。如果她到不了公爵夫人的游园会，我也就无能为力了。”

约克没有在人前说过这一点。当有人在场时，他说话总是毕恭毕敬。现在，他抚摸我的全身，很快找到了我被踢到的后腿跗关节上方的那个地方，那儿非常肿痛。他吩咐用热水给我擦洗一下，然后上了一些药剂。

得知发生的一切后，W勋爵非常恼火。他责怪约克向夫人让步，约克回答说他今后更喜欢只接受先生的命令。而我认为这没有任何作用，因为情况还是像从前那样持续下去。我还以为约克可以更好地保护他的马儿们，也许我没有判断力。

姜姐再也没有被套进马车，而当她伤好后，伯爵的一个小儿子说想要她，他确信姜姐一定会是一匹好猎马。而我仍旧被迫拉车，而且有了一个新搭档，名叫马克斯。他始终习惯绷紧的缰绳。我问他是怎么忍受这一切的。

“噢，”他说，“我之所以忍受，是因为我必须这样。但是，这种缰绳会缩短我的生命。如果你不得不戴下去的话，那也会缩短你的生命。”

“你认为，”我问，“我们的主人知道这对我们有多么糟糕吗？”

“我说不上来。”他说，“但是，马贩子和马医都非常清楚。我当时还在马贩子那儿，他正训练我和另一匹马搭档。他要我们抬高头，像他说的那样，每天高一点儿高一点儿。当时那儿有一位先生问他为什么这样做。‘因为，’他说，‘如果我们不这样做，别人就不买他们。伦敦人总是想要他们的马儿把头抬高，把腿抬高。当然，这样对马来说非常糟糕，却有利于交易。马儿很快就会疲惫或得病，他们就会来再买一对。’”马克斯说，“这就是我亲耳听他说的。你可以自己判断。”

我给夫人拉车的漫长的四个月遭受的痛苦，真是难以形容。我完全相信，如果这种痛苦再持续更久的话，我的健康或好脾气就会垮掉。此前，我从来不知道什么是口吐白沫，而现在锋利的嚼子在我的舌头和下颚活动，头部和喉咙深受压迫，总会让我的嘴巴泛起或多或少的白沫。看到这个，有些人认为很好，说：“多么出色、多么精神的牲口！”然而，就像人口吐白沫一样，马口吐白沫也是不正常的，这是一种不适的确切征兆，说明马儿应该得到照顾。除此以外，我的气管也有压迫感，常常让我的呼吸很不舒服。我干完活儿回来后，脖子和胸部都紧张痛苦，嘴和舌头都很疼，感觉疲惫沮丧。

在原来那个家，我始终知道约翰和我的主人是我的朋友。然而，在这儿，尽管我在好多方面都受到优待，但是我没有朋友。约克也许已经知道，很有可能真的知道缰绳对我是何等的折磨。不过，我想他把这当成理所当然却又无能为力的事儿。无论如何，什么也解救不了我。





第二十四章　安妮小姐


早春时节，W伯爵和一部分家庭成员去了伦敦，还带去了约克。我和姜姐，还有其他几匹马，都被留在家里备用，马夫领班留下来照料。

留在庄园里的哈丽特小姐是一个重病患者，从来不坐马车出门。安妮小姐喜欢跟她的兄弟或堂兄弟们一道骑马。她是一个无可挑剔的女骑手，不仅漂亮，而且快乐、温和。她选我作她的坐骑，还给我起名叫黑风。我非常喜欢这样兜风，在清爽的空气中跟姜姐或莉齐一起奔跑。这个莉齐是一匹机灵的红棕色母马，几乎是纯种马，因为动作优雅、性情活泼，所以颇受男士们宠爱。但是，姜姐比我更了解她，她告诉我说莉齐相当胆怯。

庄园里住有一个名叫布兰泰尔的先生，他总是骑莉齐，对她赞不绝口。有一天，安妮小姐吩咐把女鞍架到莉齐的身上，另一副鞍子架到我的身上。当我们来到门口时，那位先生似乎非常不安。

“这是怎么回事？”他问，“你对你的好黑风厌倦了吗？”

“噢，不，一点儿也不，”她答道，“我可是善心大发，让你也骑他一次，我来试骑你的迷人的莉齐。我必须承认，她在尺寸和外观上都比我最爱的黑风更有女士坐骑的样子。”

“请让我忠告你，不要骑她，”他说，“她是一匹迷人的马儿，可对女士来说她过于紧张。我确切地告诉你，她很不安全，我还是求你把马鞍换过来吧。”

“亲爱的表兄，”安妮小姐笑道，“请善良体贴的你不要为我费心了。我从孩提时就已经开始骑马了，尽管我知道你不赞成姑娘们打猎，但是我已经跟着马队狩猎好几次了。这可是事实，你们男士们都这样喜欢这个莉齐，我就想试试。请你帮我骑上去吧，好朋友就要有好朋友的样子。”

他没再说什么，小心翼翼地把她扶上马鞍，看了看嚼子和马勒，把缰绳轻轻地放进她的手里，随后骑到了我的身上。我们正要离开，一个男仆带着一片纸以及哈丽特小姐的口信走了出来——“他们能帮她去阿什利医生家问问这个问题，然后带来回复吗？”

村子大概有一英里远，医生家是村里的最后一家。我们一路兴高采烈地来到了他家大门口。他的房子坐落在高大的常青树丛中，离大门还有一小段车程。

布兰泰尔在大门口下马，正要为安妮小姐开门，她却说道：“我在这儿等你，你可以把黑风的缰绳拴在大门上。”

他怀疑地看着她。“我不到五分钟就回来。”他说。

“噢，别着急。我和莉齐是不会从你这儿逃跑的。”

他把我的缰绳拴在一根铁钉上，很快就消失在了树丛中。莉齐静静地站在路边，背对着我，离我有几步远。我的年轻小姐手挽着松弛的缰绳，悠然自得地坐在那儿，哼着小曲。我一直听着布兰泰尔先生的脚步声，直到他到了房前，我还听到他敲门的声音。大路的另一边是一片牧场，大门敞开着。就在此时，一些拉车马和几匹小马毫无秩序地跑了出来，后面一个男孩子正啪啪地抽着一根大鞭子。那些小马野性调皮，其中一匹跑过大路，踉踉跄跄地撞在了莉齐的后腿上。我说不清，是怪那匹愚笨的小马，还是怪响亮的甩鞭声，或者是两者兼而有之，反正莉齐猛地踢了一脚，飞快地狂奔而去。这一切突如其来，安妮小姐差点儿从马上摔下来，她却又很快坐稳了身子。我发出了响亮尖锐的嘶叫，进行求救。我一遍又一遍地嘶叫，焦急地刨着地面，甩着脑袋，想挣脱缰绳。我早就等不及了。布兰泰尔先生跑到大门边，他神情忧虑地环顾四周，当时只看到大路的远处有飞驰而去的身影。他立即翻身上马。我无需他策马扬鞭，因为我和骑手一样迫不及待。他看出了这一点，放松缰绳，微微前倾，我们向她们追去。

我们跑了大约一英里半的直路，然后向右转，接着路分成了两条。我们还远没有跑到拐弯处，她就从视野中消失了。她拐向哪条路了呢？一个女人正站在花园门口，手搭凉棚，急切地望着大路。布兰泰尔先生几乎没有勒缰减速就大声喊道：“哪边？”“右边。”那女人手指着右边大声说道，我们沿着右边的路继续追赶。随后，曾有一刻，我们看见了安妮小姐。又一个拐弯，她再次失去了影踪。有好几次，我们都是瞥见人影，随即又跟丢了，好像根本接近不了她们。一个老修路工站在一堆石头近旁，铁锹掉落，两手举起。我们走近时，他做出要说话的手势。布兰泰尔稍微拉了一下缰绳。“去公地了，先生，去公地了。她拐到那儿去了。”我非常熟悉这个公地；大部分地面都很不平坦，长满了石南丛和深绿色的荆豆灌木丛，到处都是灌木丛生的老荆棘树；还有一些长着茂密矮草的空地，到处都是蚁山和鼹鼠洞。据我所知，这是最不适宜急速飞奔的地方。

我们还没追到公地那儿，便又看见那身绿色骑装在我们前方飞奔。小姐的帽子不见了，棕色长发在身后飘动。她的头和身体后仰，好像正用剩下的全部体力拽着缰绳，而这力量似乎也快要耗尽了。显而易见，路面的起伏已经让莉齐大大减速，看来我们有机会追上她了。

刚才我们在大路上奔跑时，布兰泰尔放开了我的头。但是，现在他凭借轻柔的手和训练有素的眼睛引领我前进，颇具大师风范。我们的速度丝毫没有放慢，我们正在果断地逼近她们。

大约在石南丛生的荒地的半道上，有一条刚挖的宽沟，挖出来的泥土胡乱地堆在另一边。这肯定会让她们停下来！但是，没有。莉齐几乎没有停顿，就纵身跳起，绊在了那些粗硬的土块上，摔倒在地。布兰泰尔低吟道：“哎，黑风，竭尽全力啊！”他牢牢地拉住我的缰绳。我振作精神，果断一跃，跳过了沟岸。

可怜的小姐脸朝下趴在灌木丛中，一动不动。布兰泰尔跪下来，叫她的名字，却没有任何声音。他轻轻地扳起她的脸，只见她脸色惨白，眼睛闭合。“安妮，亲爱的安妮，请说话！”但是，没有回答。他解开她的骑装，松开她的领口，摸着她的手和手腕，然后突然站起，疯狂地环顾四周想要求救。

不远处有两个人在割草皮，他们看到莉齐狂奔着，背上没有骑手，就放下手里的活儿去追她。

布兰泰尔的呼唤声很快把他们引到了现场。最先赶到的男子见此情景显得非常不安，问他能做什么。

“你会骑马吗？”

“啊，先生，我不大会骑。但是，为了安妮小姐，我愿意冒断脖子的危险。她那年冬天对我的妻子好极了。”

“那就骑上这匹马，我的朋友——你的脖子会相当安全——骑马去医生那儿，叫他立刻过来——然后去庄园——把你知道的一切都告诉他们，让他们把那辆马车送过来，带上安妮小姐的女仆和帮手。我就留在这儿。”

“好吧，先生。我会竭尽全力，我恳求上帝让我可爱的年轻小姐立刻睁开眼睛。”随后，他望着赶来的第二个人大声喊道：“嗨，乔，跑去端些水来，叫我的妻子尽快到安妮小姐这儿来。”

随后，他总算爬上了马鞍，两腿一夹我的两侧，“驾”的一声，稍微绕开那个沟渠，开始上路。他手里没有鞭子，这好像让他感到不安。但是，我的脚步很快就消除了他的不安，他发现他能做的最好的事儿就是紧紧地贴住马鞍，夹住我，他果断地这样做了。我尽可能少晃他，而在崎岖的地面上，他大声叫道：“稳住！喔！稳住！”到了大路上，我们就平安无事了。在医生家和在庄园里，他跑腿的活儿做得诚实可靠。他们请他喝点儿东西。“不，不，”他说，“我要穿过田地抄近路返回他们那儿，要赶在马车之前回到那儿。”

得知消息后，家里好一阵忙乱和骚动。我刚被带进畜栏，就被摘下了马鞍和笼头，身上盖上了一块布。

姜姐被套上鞍子后，就匆匆忙忙出发了，她要去找乔治勋爵。我不久便听到马车驶出了院子。

好像过了很久，姜姐才回来，又过了很久，畜栏中才只剩我们两个。她把自己看到的一切都告诉了我。

“我能说得不多，”她说，“我们差不多是一路飞奔，到那儿时，医生刚好骑马赶到。只见一个女人坐在地上，小姐的头枕在她的腿上。医生向她嘴里倒了些东西，而我听见的一切就是‘她没死’。随后，我被一个人牵到了不远处。过了一会儿，她被抬进了马车，我们就一起回家了。我听到主人对一个拦住他询问的人说，他希望没有骨折，但是她还没有开口说话。”

当乔治勋爵带姜姐去打猎时，约克摇了摇头。他说，猎马的第一个训练季，应该找一个稳妥的人驯马，而不是像乔治勋爵这样随意的骑手。

姜姐过去非常喜欢打猎，而有时她回来后，我能看出她非常疲惫，她偶尔会短暂地咳嗽一下。她兴致勃勃，没有抱怨，我却还是禁不住为她感到担忧。

事发两天后，布兰泰尔先生过来看我。他拍了拍我，对我大加赞扬。他告诉乔治勋爵说，他相信那匹马像他一样知道安妮的危险。“我就是想挡都挡不住他，”他说，“她绝不应该骑任何其他的马。”从他们的对话中，我得知我的年轻小姐现在脱离了危险，不久又能骑马了。这对我来说是一个喜讯，我盼望幸福的生活。





第二十五章　鲁宾·史密斯


现在，我必须说说鲁宾·史密斯。约克去伦敦后，鲁宾·史密斯留下来接管了马厩。没有人比他更精通业务了。当他一切正常时，没有一个人能比他更忠诚、更有价值。他管马时性情温和，十分机智，因为他曾跟一个外科兽医合住过两年，所以他差不多还可以给马看病。他驾车一流，无论是四马马车还是两马马车，他都能轻松驾驶。他相貌英俊，学识渊博，举止非常文雅。我相信大家都喜欢他，当然，马也喜欢他。唯一让人惊讶的是，他竟然处在一种低下的地位，而不是像约克一样处在马夫头儿的位置。不过，他有一个极大的缺点，那就是爱喝酒。他不像有些男人那样总是喝个不停，他总是几个星期或几个月保持节制，之后酒瘾就会爆发，像约克所说的那样，狂喝一阵，既丢自己的脸，又让他的妻子胆战心惊，还会给跟他有关的一切带来麻烦。然而，他非常得力，所以约克把这件事隐瞒了两三次，没有让伯爵知道。但是，一天夜里，当鲁宾不得不驾车把一群人从舞会上送回家时，他喝得酩酊大醉，握不住缰绳，所以其中一位先生不得不登上马车驾车把那些女士送回家。当然，事儿瞒不住了，鲁宾马上就被辞退了。他可怜的妻子和小孩子们不得不离开庄园大门边漂亮的小木屋，能去哪儿就去哪儿。这一切都是老马克斯告诉我的，因为那是好久以前发生的事儿了。但是，在我和姜姐到来之前不久，史密斯又被召了回来。约克向非常好心的伯爵求了情，史密斯信誓旦旦，只要他住在那儿，就绝不再沾一滴酒。史密斯信守承诺，所以约克认为自己不在时能放心让他顶替自己的位置，而且他非常聪明诚实，好像没有人比他更合适了。

此时是四月初，伯爵一家预期五月份回来。那辆轻便的四轮马车将被重新组装，因为布兰泰尔上校必须返回部队。根据安排，史密斯要驾车把他送到镇上，然后再骑马回来。因此，史密斯带上了马鞍，此行我被选中。在车站，上校在史密斯的手里放了一些钱，跟他道别说：“鲁宾，照顾好你年轻的妻子，不要让任何想骑黑风的冒失小伙子随便乱骑——让他为女士服务。”

我们把马车留在了车铺，史密斯骑着我去了白狮旅馆，他吩咐马夫好好喂我，四点钟为他备好马。我一条前腿蹄铁的螺丝在来时路上就已经松动了。但是，马夫大约四点钟才发现。五点钟时，史密斯走进院子，说他六点钟才会离开，因为他遇见了一些老朋友。于是，马夫把螺丝松动的事儿告诉了他，问他是不是要检查一下蹄铁。

“不，”史密斯说，“到我们回家都不会有问题。”

他说话声非常响亮，随随便便，我认为不察看一下我的铁蹄很不像他的做法，因为他向来都十分重视我们脚掌上松动的钉子。他六点钟没有来，七点钟没有来，八点钟也没有来，快九点时他才叫我，声音响亮粗鲁。他似乎脾气很糟，还骂了看马人，尽管我说不清为什么。

店老板站在门口，说道：“小心，史密斯先生！”而他却骂骂咧咧，生气地回答，几乎还没有跑出镇子，他就开始策马飞奔。尽管当时我已经在全速前进，但他还是常常用鞭子狠狠地抽打我。月亮还没有升起，天色很黑。大路最近刚刚修过，上面都是石子。我以这样的速度奔跑在上面，蹄铁越来越松了，我们临近收费公路关卡时，蹄铁就脱落了。

如果史密斯神志清醒，就会感觉到我的步伐出了毛病；但是，他酩酊大醉，注意不到。

关卡那边是一段长路，刚铺上石子——又长又尖的石子，任何马儿被骑到这样的路上快跑，都是一种冒险。就是在这种路上，而且掉了一块蹄铁，我还被迫全速快跑，同时骑手用鞭子狠狠地抽打着我，嘴里骂骂咧咧，催我再快些。当然，我那只掉了铁掌的蹄子遭受了巨大的痛苦。那只蹄子裂开，裂到了活肉部分，里面被尖锐的石子扎得生疼。

不能再向前跑了。在这种情况下，没有一匹马还能再跑下去。我疼痛难忍，趔趄一下，猛地跪倒在地。史密斯因我跌倒而被甩了出去，而且因为我跑的速度很快，所以他一定是重重地摔倒了。我很快就站了起来，一瘸一拐地走到路边，那儿没有石子。月亮刚刚爬上了树篱梢。我借着月光可以看到史密斯躺在离我几码远的地方。他没有站起来。他稍微努力了一下想站起来，随后是一声沉重的呻吟。我本也可以呻吟，因为我的一只蹄子和两个膝盖都在遭受剧痛。但是，马儿习惯默默地忍受痛苦。我没有发出任何声音，而是站在那儿倾听。史密斯又发出了一声沉重的呻吟。不过，尽管此刻他躺在皎洁的月光下，但是我看不见任何姿势的变化。我对他、对自己都无能为力，可是，噢！我是多么渴望听到马声、车轮声或脚步声啊！路上走过的人不多。夜里这个时候，我们要等救援的人来，可能要等上好几个小时。我在那儿张望、倾听。这是一个宁静甜蜜的四月的夜晚，只有夜莺的几声低鸣，只有月亮旁边的朵朵白云，只有一只在树篱上方飞来飞去的褐色猫头鹰。这让我想起了很久以前的那些夏夜，当时在格雷农场主翠绿宜人的草地上，我常常躺在妈妈的身边。





第二十六章　如此结局


我听到大老远传来了马蹄声，一定是将近半夜时分。声音时隐时现，然后越来越清晰，越来越近了。到伯爵府要先穿过伯爵家的树林。声音就是从那个方向传来的，我希望那会是来寻找我们的。随着那声音越来越近，我几乎可以确信那是姜姐的蹄声。再靠近一点儿时，我可以听出她拉着一辆轻便双轮马车。我大声嘶叫。听到姜姐的回应和人们的声音，我喜出望外。他们从石子路上慢慢地驶过来，在路上躺着的那个黑影边停下。

其中一个人跳下车，俯身查看。“是鲁宾，”他说，“他不动了！”

另一个人跟过来，也向他弯下腰。“他死了，”他说，“感觉一下，他的两只手是多么凉！”

他们把他抱起来，却没有任何生命迹象，他的头发浸满了血。他们又把他放下来，过来看我。他们很快就看到了我受伤的膝盖。

“啊，是这匹马跌倒，把他甩了出去！谁会想到这匹黑马会这样做呢？没有人相信他会摔倒。鲁宾一定在这儿躺了好几个小时！说也奇怪，这匹马竟然没有离开现场。”

随后，罗伯特想把我向前拉。我迈了一步，却差点儿又摔倒。

“喂！他的这只蹄子像两个膝盖一样伤得很重。瞧这儿——他的蹄子完全被划成了碎片。他很可能残废了，可怜的家伙！奈德，我告诉你，我怀疑鲁宾不对劲儿。试想一下，他骑着掉了一块蹄铁的马过那些石子路的情景吧！唉，如果他神志清醒的话，他就会宁愿尽力从月亮上骑过去。我担心他是又犯病了。可怜的苏珊！她来我家问他是否回来时脸色惨白。她假装自己毫不担忧，谈到了好多可能耽误他行程的事儿。不过，尽管如此，但她还是恳求我去迎迎他——可是，我们必须怎么办呢？带一匹马和一具遗体回去，这绝非易事。”

接下来，他们商量了一下决定，罗伯特作马夫，负责牵我，而奈德必须扛遗体。把遗体放进马车并非易事，因为没有人去牵姜姐，而她和我一样知道他们正在干什么，站在那儿一动不动。我之所以注意到这一点，是因为，如果说姜姐有缺点的话，那就是她站着时会急躁。

奈德拉着鲁宾的遗体慢慢地上路了。罗伯特又过来看了看我的脚，然后拿出手帕，紧紧绑住，他就这样牵着我回家。我永远不会忘记那次夜行。有三英里多的路程。罗伯特牵着我慢慢走着。我忍着剧痛，一瘸一拐，尽可能走好路。我相信，罗伯特为我难过，因为他经常爱抚和鼓励我，和颜悦色地对我说着话。

我终于回到了自己的畜栏，吃了一些谷物。罗伯特用湿布裹住我的膝盖，把糠泥敷剂绑到我的蹄子上，这可以在明天早上马医到来之前帮我先去热、清洁。我不顾疼痛，设法让自己躺在稻草上睡觉。

第二天，马医给我检查过伤口后说，他希望我的关节没有受伤，这样的话，我以后还可以继续工作，而我身上却永远都留有伤疤。我相信，他们已竭尽全力给我良好的治疗了，那可是一个漫长痛苦的治疗。我的膝盖上长了他们所谓的疤瘤，用腐蚀剂烧掉了。最终愈合后，他们在我两个膝关节前面涂上了一种灼热的液体来彻底脱毛。他们这样做是有原因的，而且我认为也应该这么做。

因为史密斯的死突如其来，而且没有目击者在场，所以他们进行了调查。白狮旅馆的老板、马夫，还有其他好几个人都举证说，史密斯从旅馆出来时就喝醉了；关卡的看守说他通过关卡时快马加鞭；而我的蹄铁也在石子间找到了，所以这个案子真相大白，我被洗刷了所有的罪责。

大家都同情苏珊。她快疯了，总是翻来覆去地说着：“噢！他真好啊——真好啊！这都是该死的酒。他们为什么要卖那该死的酒啊？噢，鲁宾，鲁宾！”她就这样喊着，直到鲁宾安葬。当时，因为她既没有家，也没有亲戚，所以她和她的六个小孩子被迫再次离开了高大橡树旁边那个舒适的家，进了阴暗的大济贫所。





第二十七章　糟蹋和衰落


膝盖一充分痊愈，我就被送到一个小牧场待了一两个月。那儿没有任何其他动物。尽管我可以享受自由和甜美的草儿，但是我早已习惯了群居，所以感到非常孤独。我和姜姐已经成为忠实的朋友，现在我特别想念她的陪伴。听到过路的马蹄声，我常常嘶叫，却很少能得到回应。直到一天早晨，大门被打开。除了亲爱的老姜姐之外，谁会进来呢？那个人解开她的缰绳，把她留在了那儿。我高兴地嘶叫了一声，小跑到她的身边。我们俩见面都很高兴，我却很快发现，他们把她带过来跟我在一起，并不是为了让我们高兴。她的故事太长了，讲不过来，一句话，她被残酷的骑乘毁了，现在被送到这儿是看她剩下还会做什么。

乔治勋爵年轻，不愿接受任何警告。他是一个无情的骑手，只要有机会，就会去打猎。他对他的马儿漠不关心。我离开马厩不久之后，就有一场越野障碍赛马，他决定骑马参加比赛。尽管马夫告诉他说姜姐有点儿紧张，不适合参加这种比赛，但是他不相信，所以比赛那天他催促姜姐跟上最前面的骑手。姜姐精神抖擞，竭尽全力，随着前三名冲过了终点，她的气管却受了伤，而且乔治勋爵对她来说太重了，所以她的背也受了伤。“就这样，”她说，“我们就到了这儿，在我们年富力强时被糟蹋了，你是被一个醉鬼，我是被一个傻瓜。真难受啊！”我们俩都由衷地感到已不是从前的自己了。然而，这也没有破坏我们彼此相伴时的那种乐趣。我们不再像过去那样飞奔，但是我们常常一起进食，一起躺下，一起在那棵婆娑的菩提树下头挨着头站立好几个小时。我们就这样度过了那段时光，直到家里人从城里回来。

一天，我们看见伯爵走进牧场，约克跟他一起。我们认出了是谁，但还是静静地站在菩提树下，让他们走到我们身边。他们仔细查看我们。伯爵好像非常恼火。

“就是扔掉三百英镑，也毫无用处，”他说，“不过，我最关心的是我老朋友的这些马，他以为他们在我这儿会找到一个好归宿，结果他们却被毁了。那匹母马会再跑十二个月，我们看看这对她会不会有用。不过，那匹黑马必须卖掉。尽管非常可惜，但是我的马厩里不能收留膝盖伤成这样的马儿。”

“是的，主人，当然不能。”约克说，“不过，他可能会有一个不注重相貌、还会受到优待的去处。我认识巴思的一个人，他开有几家马行，常常想低价买一匹好马。我知道他对马照顾得非常周到。那次审讯澄清了这匹马的品质，而且主人或我的推荐也足以为他担保。”

“你最好给他写封信，约克。我关心的不是他能卖多少钱，而是那个地方。”

之后，他们就离开了我们。

“他们很快就会带你走，”姜姐说，“我就要失去自己唯一的朋友了，十有八九我们再也不能相见了。这个冷酷的世界啊！”

之后大约一周，罗伯特拿着笼头来到了这个地方，套在了我的头上，就把我牵走了。姜姐没有临别寄语。我要被牵走时，我们彼此嘶叫了一声，她顺着树篱焦急地小跑，对我呼唤，直到听不到我的蹄声。

通过约克的推荐，我被马行的主人买走了。我不得不坐火车去，我对这不熟悉，第一次坐火车需要极大的勇气。但是，后来我发现火车的喷气声、呼啸声、吹哨声，尤其是我站立的运马货车的颤抖，都没有对我造成真正的伤害，所以我很快就默默地接受了。

到达旅程终点后，我发现自己来到了一个还算舒适的马厩，而且受到了细心照顾。这些马厩不像我过去常常待的那些马厩一样通风舒适。这些畜栏地面不平，处在斜坡上，因为我的头总是被拴在马槽上，所以我不得不总是站在斜坡上，这令我疲乏不堪。人们好像还不知道，如果马儿能站得舒服，并且可以转身的话，就能干更多的活儿。不过，我吃得很好，还被擦得干干净净的。总的来说，我认为，我们的主人总是尽可能地照顾我们。他养了好多马儿，还有用来出租的各种马车。有时，他自己的马夫来驾车；有时，马儿和马车被租给先生或小姐们驾驶。





第二十八章　打工马和赶马人


迄今为止，至少总是由会骑马的人来骑我。但是，在这个地方，我将会体验到我们马儿遭受的各种各样的坏把式和无知驾驭。因为我是一匹“打工马”，所以会被出租给各种想租用我的人。因为我心平气和，靠得住，所以常常比其他马儿更多地被租给无知骑手。尽管要讲述所有的驾驭方式得用很长时间，但我还是要提上几种。

首先，有一种紧拉缰绳的赶车人——他们似乎认为一切全靠尽力握紧缰绳，从来不放松勒着马嘴的绳子，也从来不给马儿一点儿活动自由。他们总是在谈的就是“完全掌控马儿”和“拉高马头”，好像马生来不会自己抬头一样。

一些可怜衰弱的马儿，嘴巴已经被这样的车夫弄得僵硬、没有感觉了，他们也许能从这样的驾驭方式中得到一些帮助。但是，对一匹能靠自己的腿站立、嘴巴敏感、容易引导的马儿来说，这不仅是痛苦的折磨，而且愚蠢。

然后，还有放松缰绳的赶车人，他们让缰绳松垮地躺在我们的背上，他们自己的手懒洋洋地放在膝盖上。当然，如果突然发生什么事儿，这些先生就对马儿没有任何控制力了。如果马儿受惊、惊跳或踉跄，他们就会无所作为，既帮不了马儿，也帮不了自己，直至酿成惨祸。当然，我自己对这样的驾驭方式没有意见，因为我不习惯惊跳，也不习惯踉跄，只习惯依靠赶车人的引导和鼓励行动。尽管如此，但是马儿喜欢下山时能感觉到有缰绳稍微拉着，喜欢知道赶车人没有睡着。

此外，赶车懒散会让马儿养成坏的、通常是懒惰的习惯，这样的马转手后，不得不通过挨鞭子，或多或少地忍受痛苦和麻烦，来改掉那些习惯。戈登先生总是让我们保持最佳的步伐和最好的举止。他说要毁掉一匹马让他养成坏习惯，就像宠坏一个孩子一样残酷，以后二者都不得不为此受苦。

还有，这些车夫常常都很粗心，对任何别的事儿都很关心，唯独对他们的马儿不行。一天，我拉着四轮敞篷轻便马车跟这样一个车夫出去，后面坐着一位女士和两个孩子。我们在动身之前，他笨拙地动了动缰绳，尽管我已经动身了，但他还是理所当然、毫无意义地狠狠抽了我几鞭。那儿一直都在大面积修路，即使那些没有新铺石子的地方，到处也有好多散落的石子。车夫在跟夫人和孩子们谈笑风生，谈东说西，却从来不认为他的马儿值得密切注视，值得行驶在最平坦的路上。所以，我的一只前脚掌很容易就踩进了一个石子。

现在，如果戈登先生或约翰在，事实上任何一个好车夫在，他都会在我三步之内看到有不对劲儿的地方。即使是在夜里，老把式也会从缰绳上感觉到步伐不对劲儿，下车取出那个石子。但是，这个人却继续谈笑风生，而每走一步，石子就会更加牢固地嵌进我的脚掌和蹄叉之间。石子尖的一面插在里面，圆的一面留在外面。大家都知道，这是马儿能碰上的最危险的石子，既能划伤马蹄，又能让马儿踉跄跌倒。

我说不清这个人到底是半瞎还是粗心大意，他就这样让我的蹄子里塞了石子足足走了半英里，什么都没有看见。到我疼得一瘸一拐，他才终于看到了，大声叫道：“喂，走啊！唉，他们居然给我们派了一匹瘸马！真不像话！”

随后，他扔下缰绳，拿起鞭子，一边劈头盖脸地抽，一边说道：“好了，跟我摆老资格没用。还要赶路，装瘸偷懒都没用。”

就在这时，一个农场主骑着一匹棕色短腿马走过来。他抬了抬帽子，停了下来。

“对不起，先生，”他说，“不过，我认为你的马有毛病。从它走路的样子看，我认为它的蹄铁里面好像有石子。如果你允许的话，我想看看他的蹄子。这些散落的石子对马儿来说是该死的危险东西。”

“他是一匹雇来的马。”车夫说，“我不知道他有什么毛病，他们派了这样一匹瘸马，可真不像话。”

农场主下了马，把缰绳挽在胳膊上，立刻抬起我离他最近的那只蹄子。

“我的天哪，有石子！瘸！我想也是！”

起先，他想用手把石子抠出来。但是，因为现在卡得很紧，所以他从口袋里掏出取石器，小心翼翼也很费劲地把石子取了出来。随后，他举起石子，说道：“瞧，这就是你的马踩进的石子。他没有摔倒跌破膝盖，真是奇迹！”

“噢，当然！”车夫说，“真是怪事！以前我从来不知道马蹄踩进石子这种事儿。”

“你不知道？”农场主相当轻蔑地说。“不过，马蹄是会踩进石子的，即使最好的马儿也会，在这样的路上有时难免。如果你不想让你的马儿变成瘸子，就必须留神，马蹄一踩进石子就马上取出来。这只蹄子已经严重受伤了。”他把我的那只蹄子轻轻地放下，拍了拍我说，“先生，我劝你，最好让他悠着走一会儿。这只蹄子严重受伤，一瘸一拐的情况不会马上消失。”

说完，他骑上马，向女士抬抬帽子，就策马而去了。

他走后，我的车夫开始抖缰绳拽马具，我明白我必须前进，我当然明白这一点，我很高兴石子没有了，但还是很疼。

这就是我们打工马经常经受的考验。





第二十九章　伦敦佬


还有就是像开蒸汽机一样的赶车方式。这些车夫大都是城里人，他们从来没有养过马儿，通常乘火车出行。

他们似乎总认为马儿跟蒸汽机差不多，只是比较小。无论如何，他们都认为，只要他们花了钱，马儿就一定要按照他们的意愿，要他跑多快就得跑多快，要他跑多远就得跑多远，要他驮多重就得驮多重。不管道路是泥泞难走还是干燥好走，不管是多石还是平坦，不管是上坡还是下坡，都是一样——前进，前进，前进，必须前进，保持同样的步幅，既没有安慰，也没有体谅。

这些人从来不考虑下车自己走上陡坡。噢，不，他们已经付钱了就要坐车，他们一定要坐车！马儿呢？噢，他已经习惯了！如果不把人们拉上山，马儿生下来做什么呢？走路！真是好笑！所以，鞭子抽起来，缰绳抖起来，常常还会有一阵粗暴的责骂声：“快走啊，你这懒畜生！”紧接着又是狠狠一鞭，这时我们始终在竭尽全力向前赶路，没有怨言，乖乖听话，尽管内心常常厌烦、痛苦和沮丧。

这种开蒸汽机式的驾车风格比任何其他类型的驾驶方法都更快地耗尽我们的体力。我宁愿为一个体贴的好车夫跑二十英里，也不愿为这种人跑十英里，这会让我事倍功半。

还有一点，无论下坡路多么陡，他们几乎都不拉刹车，因此严重事故时有发生。要么就是拉住刹车，到了坡底常常忘记松开，我不止一次不得不拉着刹住一只轮子的马车爬上另一个陡坡，到了半坡上，我的车夫才想到这一点，这会让一匹马非常疲劳。

因此，这些伦敦佬不会像绅士那样以从容的步伐开始，常常在马厩院时就全速动身。当他们想停下时，会先鞭打我们，然后突然停下，我们差点儿摔坐在地上，我们的嘴巴会被马嚼子弄得参差不齐——他们把这称为急刹车。拐弯时，他们那样急转，就像路上没有正行逆行似的。

我清楚记得一个春天的夜晚，我和罗里已经出去一天了（罗里是跟我搭档拉车的主力马，是一个诚实的好小伙子）。我们有自己的车夫，他总是对我们体贴友善，所以我们那天非常开心。黄昏时分，我们正以敏捷的步伐飞快地走在回家的路上。我们的路突然转向了左边。但是，我们离自己这一侧的树篱很近，而且有足够的空间可以通过，所以我们的车夫没有让我们靠边。就在我们接近拐角时，我听到一匹马正拉着两轮马车朝我们的方向冲下坡来。树篱很高，我什么也看不见，紧接着我们就撞在了一起。幸运的是，我站在靠近树篱的那侧。罗里站在车辕的左侧，甚至没有辕杆保护他。那个赶车人一直冲这个拐角赶来，当看到我们时，他已经来不及靠到他自己那边了。所有的冲击力都撞在了罗里身上。车辕正好撞到了他的胸部，他大叫一声，踉跄后退，这叫声我永远难忘。另一匹马跌坐下去，一根辕杆被撞断了。原来那也是我们马厩里的一匹马，他拉着年轻人们非常喜欢的轻便高轮马车。

赶车人是那种漫无目的的无知之徒，他们甚至不知道自己应该走路的哪一边，或者，即使他们知道，也满不在乎。可怜的罗里皮开肉绽，鲜血直流。他们说，如果再靠边一点点儿，就会要了他的命。如果真是那样，对这个可怜的家伙来说也是一件好事。

事实上，过了很久，他的伤才痊愈，随后他就被卖去拉煤车了。那是什么滋味，只有马儿知道，就是在那些陡峭的山路上上上下下地拉车。我在那儿看到过一些这样的景象，就是一匹马后面拉着沉重的两轮车走下坡路，马车上连刹车装置都没有安。这样的景象至今我想起来都难过。

罗里受伤之后，我经常跟一匹名叫佩吉的母马一起拉车。她住在我旁边的畜栏里，健壮匀称，皮毛呈鲜亮的暗褐色，长着美丽的斑点，鬃毛和尾巴呈深棕色。尽管她的血统并不高贵，但是她非常漂亮，性情温和，积极肯干。尽管如此，但是她的眼里有一种焦虑的神情，我知道她有某种烦恼。我们第一次出去时，我认为她的步伐很怪。她好像时而小跑，时而慢跑三四步，然后向前跳一小步。

跟她一起拉车的马都很不愉快，我也非常烦躁。我们到家后，我问她是什么让她以这样奇怪难堪的方式走路。

“啊，”她不安地说，“我知道我的步伐很糟，但我又能怎样呢？这真不是我的过错，就是因为我的腿很短。尽管我站着几乎跟你一样高，但是你膝盖以上的腿却要比我长足足三英寸，所以你当然能比我跨得远、走得快。你明白我不是由自己制造的。我希望我能自己改造自己，那样我就会有长腿了。所有的麻烦都来自我的短腿。”佩吉以沮丧的语调说道。

“可那又怎样呢？”我说，“你这样强壮，性情和蔼，积极肯干。”

“啊，你知道，”她说，“人们喜欢走得快，如果你跟不上其他的马儿，那等待你的就始终只有鞭子、鞭子、鞭子。所以，我不得不尽可能跟上，才会走得这样蹩脚、拖拉。情况并不总是这样，当我跟第一个主人生活在一起时，我总是匀速小跑，那时他可不会那么急。他是乡下的一个年轻牧师，一个善良和蔼的主人。他有两座教堂，相距很远，他工作很多，却从来没有因我跑得不快而骂我或抽我。他非常喜欢我。我只希望我现在能跟他在一起。然而，他不得不离开，到一个大城市去，于是我被卖给了一个农场主。

“你知道，一些农场主是资本家，我却认为他是层次很低的人。他从来不在乎马好不好，也从来不在乎自己赶得好不好，只喜欢快跑。我尽力快跑，但还是不行，他总是抽我，所以我就养成了跃步向前赶的习惯。赶集的夜晚，他常常在客栈待到很晚，然后以最快的速度赶车回家。

“一个黑夜，他像往常一样飞驰回家，这时车轮突然撞到路上一个又大又重的东西上，马车立刻就翻倒了。他被甩了出去，一只胳膊摔断，我想肋骨也断了几根。不管怎样，我跟他在一起的生活结束了，我并不难过。不过，你明白，如果人们必须走得快，对我来说哪里都一样。如果我的腿再长些，该多好啊！”

可怜的佩吉！尽管我为她非常难过，但是我却无法安慰她，因为我知道慢马跟快马套在一起拉车是多么难受。所有的鞭子最终会抽到他们的身上，他们却无能为力。

她经常被用来拉四轮敞篷轻便马车，因为她非常温和，所以颇受一些女士喜欢。之后，过了一段时间，她被卖给了两位女士，她们自己赶车，想找一匹安全的好马。

我在乡下遇见过她好几次，只见她脚步稳健，一副快乐、满足的神情。见到她我非常高兴，因为她值得拥有一个好归宿。

她离开我们之后，另一匹马来顶替了她。他非常年轻，但是，因为容易惊跳而名声不好，所以失去了一个好去处。我问他是什么让他受惊的。

“啊，我不大知道，”他说，“我小时候非常腼腆，受过好几次惊吓。如果我见到什么怪事儿，就常常会转身去看——你明白，我们戴着眼罩，看不见，除非环顾四周，才能明白是怎么回事——这时，我的主人总会给我一鞭子，这当然会使我继续前进，而这并没有减轻我的恐惧。我想，如果他能让我平静地去看一切，明白没有什么会伤害我，就会万事大吉，我也会习以为常。一天，一位老先生跟他一起骑马，一大张白纸或破布正好吹到了我的一侧。我前闪后躲。主人像往常那样狠狠地抽打我，而那位老先生却大声叫道：‘你错了！你错了！你绝不该抽打一匹惊退的马。他之所以惊退，是因为他害怕。你这样做，只会让他更害怕，这个习惯会变得更糟。’所以，我认为并不是所有人都这样做。我肯定也不想因这样一个原因而惊退。但是，如果你从来没有获准去习惯什么，你怎么知道什么危险、什么不危险呢？我从来不怕我知道的一切。我当时是在一个有鹿的地方长大的。我当然了解他们，就像我了解牛羊一样，但是他们并不寻常，我知道好多敏感的马看到他们就会害怕，在经过养鹿的围场之前会骚动不安。”

我知道我的同伴说得没错，我也希望每一匹小马都有像格雷农场主和戈登先生这样好的主人。

当然我们有时在这儿也会碰上好把式。我记得，一天早上，我被套上了一辆轻便双轮马车，带到了普尔特尼街上的一座房子。两位先生走出来，个子较高的那个走到我头边，看了看马嚼子和马勒，一只手动了动项圈，看是不是套得舒适。

“你认为这匹马需要马勒吗？”他对马夫说。

“啊，”那个人说，“应该说，他没有马勒也无妨。他有一张难得的好嘴，尽管精神饱满，但是他没有任何恶习。只是我们经常发现人们喜欢用马勒。”

“我不喜欢，”先生说，“请行行好取掉它，把缰绳套在脸颊边吧。一张轻松舒适的嘴巴是长途旅行的一件大事，难道不是吗，老伙计？”他拍了拍我的脖子说。

随后，他拿起缰绳，他们俩都上了车。我现在还能记得他让我转弯时是多么悄无声息，他轻触缰绳，在我的背上轻扬马鞭，我们就出发了。

我弓起脖子，以最佳的步速动身了。我发现我身后的那个人知道应该怎么赶一匹好马。好像昔日重来似的，这让我非常开心。

这位先生非常喜欢我，坐上马鞍试了好几次之后，他劝说我的主人把我卖给他的一位朋友，他的朋友想要一匹安全舒适的马儿。于是，那年夏天我最终被卖给了巴里先生。





第三十章　小偷


我的新主人是一个未婚男人。他住在巴思，大多时间忙于生意。他的医生建议他进行骑马运动，因此他才买了我。他在距离住所不远处租了一个马厩，聘用了一个名叫费尔彻的人当马夫。主人对马儿知之甚少，但是待我很好，我本来可以有一个安逸的好地方，他却对周围的情况一无所知。他吩咐用最好的干草，充足的燕麦、碎豆子、谷糠，还有野豌豆或黑麦，想要多少就给多少。我听到主人这样吩咐过，所以我知道有好多美食，我想我会过得很好的。

有几天一切顺利。我发现马夫懂行。他始终让马厩干净通风，把我也刷洗得非常彻底，一直都性情温和。他曾在巴思一家大酒店当过马夫。他已经放弃了那份工作，现在自己种水果和蔬菜卖到集市。他的妻子养肥家禽和兔子卖钱。过了一段时间，我好像觉得燕麦非常短缺。我吃的是豆子，麸皮里掺的可不是燕麦，而是豆子，就是有燕麦也寥寥无几，肯定不到应有量的四分之一。两三周后，这开始影响我的力气和精神。尽管草料很好，但是没有谷物，无法维持我的健康。然而，我不能抱怨，也无法让他们知道我的需要。就这样过了大约两个月，我纳闷我的主人怎么看不出问题呢。但是，一天下午，他骑着我到乡下去看一位朋友，那位农场主先生住在通向威尔斯的路上，看马是火眼金睛。迎接过朋友之后，他看了我一眼，说道：

“巴里，在我看来，你的马看上去没有你当初买他时气色好；他身体好吗？”

“是的，我想是的，”我的主人说，“他现在大不如从前那样活泼了。马夫告诉我说，马儿秋天总是无精打采、有气无力，所以我必须料到这一点。”

“秋天，胡说！”农场主说，“啊，现在才到八月份，你的活儿轻，吃得又好，即使是秋天，他也不应该这样掉膘。你是怎么喂他的呢？”

主人告诉了他。他慢慢地摇了摇头，开始抚摸我的全身。

“亲爱的伙计，我说不清是谁吃了你的谷物，但是，如果是你的马吃的话，那我就大错特错了。你骑得很快吗？”

“不是，很缓。”

“那请把你的手放在这儿，”他把手伸到我的脖子和肩上说。“他就像刚从草地上出来的马一样温暖潮湿。我建议你多去观察一下马厩。我不喜欢多疑，谢天谢地，我也没有理由多疑，因为无论我在不在，我都信得过我的那些手下。不过，也有一些卑鄙小人，会邪恶到从不会说话的牲口那儿抢夺食物。你必须调查一下。”说完，他转向那个过来牵我的手下人说，“好好给这匹马喂磨碎的燕麦，不要给他定量。”

“不会说话的牲口！”是的，我们就是。但是，如果我能说话，我就会告诉主人他的燕麦到哪儿去了。每天早上大约六点钟，我的马夫常常带一个小男孩过来，小男孩总是提一只带盖的篮子。他常常跟着他的父亲走进马具房，那儿放有燕麦。当门半开时，我能看到他们把料箱里的燕麦装进一只小袋子，然后小男孩就会离开。

这之后过了五六个早上，正当小男孩离开马厩时，门被推开了，一名警察走了进来，紧紧地抓住了小男孩的胳膊，另一位警察跟了进来，从里面锁上门，说道：“带我去看你的父亲放兔食的地方。”

看上去小男孩非常害怕，开始哭了起来。但是，无路可逃，所以他带路去了谷仓。警察在那儿找到了另一个空袋子，就像小男孩篮子里装满燕麦的那个袋子。

费尔彻当时正在给我擦洗蹄子，而他们很快就发现了他。尽管他大呼小叫了好一阵子，但还是被带到了拘留所，他的儿子也被带走了。后来，我听说他的儿子没有被定罪，而他却被判了两个月的监禁。





第三十一章　骗子


主人没有马上找到合适的人。然而，没过几天，新马夫就来了。他是一个身材高大、模样英俊的家伙。但是，如果有骗子扮成马夫的话，阿尔弗雷德·斯莫克就是这种人。他对我非常文明，从来不虐待我，事实上，当主人在场看着时，他总是摸摸我、拍拍我。为了让我好看，他总会在带我出门前用水刷我的鬃毛和尾巴，用油刷我的蹄子，甚至为我清洗蹄子、检查铁掌或清洗全身。他常常把我当成一头奶牛。他任凭我的嚼子生锈，马鞍潮湿，兜带僵硬。

阿尔弗雷德·斯莫克认为自己很帅，他会在马具房的小镜子前花好多时间整理自己的头发、胡须和领带。主人对他说话时，他总是说：“是，先生。是，先生。”每说一句话，他都要碰下自己的帽子。大家都认为他是一个很好的小伙子，认为巴里先生遇到他真幸运。我要说他是我接触过的最懒惰、最自负的家伙。当然，不被虐待已经是万幸了，但是马儿要的不止于此。我有一个宽松的畜栏，要不是他懒惰从来不清扫，我本可以非常舒适。他从来不清完所有的稻草，下面的稻草发出的气味非常难闻。同时，升上来的浓浓的气体，使我的眼睛刺痛发炎，我连食欲都没有了。

一天，他的主人进来，说道：“阿尔弗雷德，马厩气味有些重。你就不能把那个马厩好好刷洗一下，多倒些水冲一下吗？”

“好，先生。”他碰了一下帽子说，“先生，如果你喜欢的话，我就会这样做。但是，在马栏里倒水有些危险，先生，马儿非常容易感冒，先生。我不想伤害他。但是，如果你喜欢的话，我就会这样做，先生。”

“噢。”他的主人说，“我不想让他感冒，但是，我不喜欢这马厩里的气味。你认为排水沟正常吗？”

“噢，先生，既然你提到了这一点，我认为排水沟的确有时会反味儿，也许出了什么毛病，先生。”

“那就叫砖匠过来看看。”他的主人说。

“好，先生，我会叫的。”

砖匠来了，揭起了好多砖头，却没有发现什么毛病。于是，他撒了一些石灰，向主人收了五先令，而我的畜栏里的气味还是像以往一样糟。不过，这还不算完——因为我站在一些潮湿的稻草上，我的蹄子开始变得不健康、易过敏，主人常常说：

“我不知道这匹马是怎么回事，他总是用蹄子摸索着走路。我有时担心他会绊倒。”

“是的，先生。”阿尔弗雷德说，“我在训练他时就已经注意到了。”

事实上，他几乎从来没有训练过我。主人忙时，我常常在马厩里一待就是好几天，根本没有伸展过腿，喂食量却跟我干重活时一样多。这经常使我的身体机能失调，有时让我难以消化，反应迟钝，更多的时候是焦躁不安。他从来不给我吃青草或谷糠，这些会让我降温，因为他既无知又自负。回来，他不训练我，也不给我换食，我只好吃药丸和汤药，这些东西除了难以下咽之外，常常让我感到恶心和不适。

一天，我的蹄子非常乏力，所以我驮着主人在一些新铺的石子路上小跑时，严重踉跄了两次。于是，他在从兰斯顿进城的路上，在一个马医那儿停下来，请他看看我是怎么回事。那个人把我的蹄子一个个抬起来仔细查看，然后站起来，拍了拍手上的灰尘，说道：

“你的马得了蹄叉腐疽，而且非常严重。他的蹄子非常乏力，没有摔倒真是幸运。我纳闷，你的马夫以前居然没有注意到。这种情况，我们经常会在一些垃圾从来不适当清除的脏马厩里发现。如果你明天把你的马夫送到这儿，我就给你的马治蹄子，我还会教你的马夫怎么涂抹我给他的擦剂。”

第二天，我的蹄子被彻底清洗了一遍，塞满了一些在浓药水里泡过的粗麻屑。这滋味可真不好受。

马医吩咐每天清除我畜栏里的所有垃圾，地面要保持干干净净。然后，我要吃谷糠，吃一些青草，不要吃太多的谷物，直到我的蹄子康复。经过这次治疗，我很快就恢复了精神。但是，两次被马夫欺骗后，巴里先生非常愤慨，决定不再养马，需要用马时就去租一匹。因此，我被养到蹄子彻底痊愈之后，便又被卖掉了。





第三部





第三十二章　马市


毫无疑问，对那些一无所知的人来说，马市是一个非常有趣的地方。至少，那儿有好多可看的东西。

那儿有一长溜一长溜来自乡下、刚从湿地牵来的小马；有一群一群毛发蓬松、没有快乐腿个子高的威尔士小马；有几百匹各种各样的拉车马，其中有些马的长尾巴被编了起来，用鲜红的绳子扎得高高的；还有好多像我一样相貌英俊、出身高贵，但因事故、损伤、呼吸不畅或其他毛病而降为中等马的马儿。那儿有一些朝气蓬勃、做什么都合适的好马，他们由在一侧奔跑的马夫牵着导引缰绳，小跑时大秀美腿，高炫步伐。但是，周围有好多可怜的马儿，因繁重劳动而不幸垮掉，膝盖弯曲，后腿每走一步都朝外甩动。还有一些看上去非常沮丧的老马，下唇耷拉，耳朵沉重后翻，好像生活再无乐趣，也再无希望了。还有一些马儿瘦得你能看见他们的所有肋骨，有些背上和臀部都是旧伤。在马看来，这些都是凄惨的景象，因为他不知道自己会不会落到同样的境地。

时而抬价，时而砍价，讨价还价声此起彼伏。如果一匹马尽其所能说出自己的想法，应该说那个马市上的谎言和骗局要比聪明人所能讲述的还要多。我跟其他两三匹强壮中用的马儿放在一起，好多人过来看我们。那些先生总是一看到我受过伤的膝盖就转过身，尽管卖我的人发誓说那只是在畜栏里滑倒造成的。

相马的第一件事就是掰开我的嘴巴，然后看我的眼睛，接着顺着我的腿一路向下摸，用劲儿摸我的皮肉，最后还要试试我的步幅。奇妙的是，人们做这些事儿的方式是多么不同。有些人做得粗鲁随便，就像那只是一块木头似的；有些人常常轻轻地将手滑过你的身体，偶尔拍拍，好像是要说：“承蒙许可。”当然，从这些买家对我的态度，我就能断定好多东西。

我想，有一个人，如果他愿意买我，我就会幸福。他不是什么绅士，也不是虚张声势自称绅士的那种人。他是一个有些矮小的人，但是体格健美，行动敏捷。从他触摸我的方式，我立刻知道他对马儿在行。他说话温和，灰色的眼睛里流露出和蔼愉悦的神色。说来可能奇怪——但却仍是真的——让我喜欢他的是，他身上有股干净清新的气味，不是我原来讨厌的那种酒味和烟味，而是一种清香，就像他刚从干草仓出来一样。他为我出价二十三英镑，却遭到了拒绝，于是他就走了。我注视着他，而他还是走了。这时，一个长相凶猛、粗声大气的人走了过来。我心惊胆战，生怕他会把我买走，还好他走开了。又来过一两个无意购买的人。随后，那个长相凶猛的人又折回来，出价二十三英镑。买卖双方展开了一场势均力敌的讨价还价，因为我的卖家开始以为自己拿不到他要求的价钱，他必须降价。但是，就在这时，那个灰色眼睛的人又折了回来。我情不自禁地向他伸出头，他和善地爱抚我的脸。

“好吧，老伙计。”他说，“我想，我们彼此都满意算了。我出二十四英镑买他。”

“假如出二十五，他就归你了。”

“二十四英镑十先令，”我的朋友以非常果断的语气说，“我就不说六便士了——行不行？”

“成交。”卖家说，“你放心好了，这匹马大有潜质。你买他拉车，稳赚不亏。”

钱当场付清，我的新主人牵住我的缰绳，把我牵出了市场，去了一家客栈。在那儿，他准备有一套马鞍和马勒。他喂我好好吃了一顿燕麦，我吃时他站在旁边，既自言自语，又对我说着话。半小时后，我们走在了去伦敦的路上，穿过惬意的小巷和乡间路，直至来到了伦敦的康庄大道。我们稳步走在大道上，黄昏时分终于到达了大城市。煤气灯已经点起，一英里又一英里，既有街道左右相随，又有街道相互交叉。我想，我们永远都走不到尽头了。最后，我们穿过一条街，来到了一个长长的马车站，这时骑我的主人欢快地大声叫道：“晚安，老板！”

“你好啊！”一个声音叫道，“你买到好马了吗？”

“我想是吧。”我的主人答道。

“我希望他带给你好运。”

“谢谢你，老板。”说完，他继续前行。我们不久走上了一条边道，大约走到一半时，拐进了一条非常狭窄的街道，一边是有些破旧的房子，另一边好像是马车房和马厩。

主人在一个房子前停住，吹了一声口哨。门飞快地打开了，一个年轻女人带着一个小女孩和一个小男孩跑了出来。下马后，主人受到了非常热烈的迎接。

“喂，哈里，我的儿子，打开大门，让妈妈把灯笼提过来。”

接下来，他们都在那个小小的马厩院子里围站在我的身边。

“爸爸，他温驯吗？”

“是的，多莉，像你自己的小猫咪一样温驯。过来拍拍他。”

那只小手马上毫不畏惧地在我的肩上拍来拍去。这种感觉真好！

“你给他刷洗，我去给他端糠糊糊。”妈妈说。

“去端吧，波莉，这正是他想要的东西。我知道你为我准备好了美味的糊糊。”

“是香肠布丁和苹果小馅饼！”小男孩大声喊道，这让大家哈哈大笑。我被牵进了一个安逸舒适、气味清新的畜栏，里面铺有好多干稻草。美餐之后，我就躺下来，心里想着自己会幸福的。





第三十三章　伦敦拉出租马车的马


我的新主人名叫杰里迈亚·巴克，但是人人都叫他杰里，所以我也这样叫他。他的妻子波莉正是男性能找到的最佳配偶。她是一个丰满端庄、娇小整洁的女人，一头柔顺的黑发，一双黑眼睛，一张有趣的小嘴。男孩子十二岁了，是一个高大、坦率、和蔼的小伙子。小多萝西（他们叫她多莉）是母亲的翻版，今年八岁了。他们都非常相亲相爱。我在这之前和之后都没有见过这么幸福快乐的一家人。杰里有一辆自己的出租马车，还有两匹马，他自己驾车，也自己照管马儿。他的另一匹马高大雪白，骨架相当大，被称为上尉。他现在老了，年轻时，一定了不起。他仍然骄傲地抬头弓脖。事实上，他是一匹血统优良、举止得体的贵族老马，彻彻底底的贵族老马。他告诉我说，他早年参加过克里米亚战争，他那时属于一名骑兵军官，常常引领军团。这件事我以后再作详述。

第二天早上，我洗刷停当后，波莉和多莉走进院子来看我，想跟我交朋友。哈里从早晨起就一直在帮他的爸爸，而且已经声明了自己的观点，就是我最终会成为“正儿八经的好汉”。波莉给我拿来了一片苹果，多莉拿了一块面包，使我以为自己好像又变回了从前的黑骏马。又有人爱抚，悄声细语地说话，真是一大快事。我也竭尽全力让他们看到我希望和他们友好相处。波莉认为我非常英俊，要不是膝盖受伤，拉出租车真是大材小用了。

“当然，没有人告诉我们这是谁的过错。”杰里说，“只要我不知道，我就要给他有利的判断。我从来没有骑过这样坚定利落的马儿。我们就按照老马的名字还叫他杰克吧——好吗，波莉？”

“好，”她说，“我喜欢好名字能传下去。”

上尉整个上午都在外面拉车。哈里放学后来喂我，给我水喝。下午我被套上车。杰里不厌其烦地检查项圈和马勒套得是否舒适，好像约翰·曼利又回来了。兜带放松一两个孔眼，一切都正好。没有马缰，没有马勒，只有普通的环形嚼子。这是多么幸运的事儿啊！

穿过边道后，我们来到了大出租车站，就是杰里说过“晚安”的那个地方。这个宽阔街道的一边是带有奇妙店面的高房，另一边是铁栅栏围着的老教堂和教堂墓地。沿着这些铁栅栏停有好多等待乘客的出租马车。地上到处散放着一些干草，有些人站在一起聊天，有些人坐在驾驶座上看报纸，还有一两个人正给他们的马喂干草，喂水。我们在最后一辆马车后面停下来。两三个人围过来，开始看我，评头论足。

“拉灵车很好。”有个人说。

“长得太帅了。”另一个人煞有介事地摇了摇头说，“过几个晴天早上，你就会发现毛病的，否则我就不叫琼斯。”

“噢。”杰里和颜悦色地说，“我想我不用找毛病，毛病就会被发现的，对吗？如果是这样的话，我还可以多保留一会儿好兴致。”

随后来了一个宽脸男人，只见他穿着灰色大衣，大衣上面缀有白色大纽扣，披一件灰色大斗篷，戴一顶灰色帽子，脖子上松散地系着一条蓝色羊毛围巾，他的头发也是灰色的。但是，他样子乐呵呵的，其他人都纷纷为他让路。他把我上下打量了一遍，就像他要买我似的。接着，他挺直身子，咕哝道：“他对你来说正合适，杰里。你付多少钱我都不会介意，他物有所值。”就这样，我的品相在这个站台上得到了肯定。

这个人名叫格兰特，而别人却叫他“灰色格兰特”或“格兰特老板”。他在这个站台上资历最老，会主动处理事务和解决纷争。他通常是一个快乐明理的人。但是，如果他犯点儿脾气，就像他有时喝高了一样，没有人喜欢离他的拳头太近，因为他可能会狠狠地给你一拳。

有生以来，我第一次拉出租车，这第一周可真难熬啊。我对伦敦根本不习惯，也不习惯喧闹、匆忙和车水马龙，我不得不一路穿行，这让我感到忧虑和厌烦。但是，我很快发现我可以完全信任我的车夫，于是我变得轻松，也渐渐地习惯了。

杰里是我认识的最好的车夫，更值得夸赞的是，他为马儿考虑得像为自己考虑得一样多。他很快发现我工作积极、竭尽全力，所以从来不抽打我，除非要出发时才会用鞭梢轻轻地撩一下我的背部。但是，一般来说，我通过他拿起缰绳的方式就完全明白这一点了，所以我相信他把鞭子放在一侧的时间常常多于拿在手里的时间。

不久，我和主人就互相了解了，就像人、马能够互通一样。在马厩里，他也尽可能让我们舒服。围栏是老款式，好多都是在斜坡上。但是，他在我们畜栏后面装有两个可以移动的栅栏，这样夜里我们休息时，他就会取掉我们的笼头，插上栅栏，我们就可以自由转动，想站哪儿就站哪儿，这真舒服。

杰里总是让我们干干净净的，他尽可能地给我们变换食物，供给量总是很大。不仅如此，他还总是给我们喝好多干净、新鲜的水，白天黑夜都把水放在我们的身边，当然我们浑身发热进来时除外。有些人说马儿不应该想喝多少就喝多少。但是，我知道，如果我们需要时就能获准喝水，一次只喝一点点儿，这比一口气喝下半桶对我们好得多，因为我们都曾被置于无水可喝、口渴难耐的境地。有些马夫会回家喝啤酒，撇下我们吃干草和燕麦，好几个小时连润嗓子的东西都不给我们。这时，我们当然一次要喝好多，这会加速我们呼吸系统的损伤，有时还会让我们的胃受寒。在这儿我们最幸福的事儿就是礼拜天可以休息。我们一周工作都非常辛苦，要不是有这么一天，我想我们不可能坚持下来。此外，这时我们才有时间享受彼此相处的时光。就是在这些日子里，我听说了同伴的往事。





第三十四章　一匹老战马


上尉曾被调教、驯养作军马之用。他的第一位主人是一名出征克里米亚战争的骑兵军官。他说，他非常喜欢跟所有其他马一起训练，一起小跑，一起左转右转，听到命令一起立定，听到号声或军官的指令全速前冲。年轻时，他毛色黝黑，是那种带斑点的铁灰色，可以说非常英俊。主人是一名意气风发的年轻绅士，非常喜欢他，从一开始就怀着极大的关怀和善意来对待他。他告诉我说，他认为军马生涯非常愉快。但是，说到坐上大轮船漂洋过海被派往国外时，他几乎改变了这种想法。

他说：“那段时间真可怕啊！当然，我们无法从陆地走到船上，所以他们不得不在我们身上套上粗绳，无论我们怎么挣扎，还是被抬了起来，越过水面，送到了大船的甲板上。在那儿，我们被放进了封闭的小畜栏。从来没有这么久看不到天空，从来没有这么久伸不开腿。轮船有时遇到大风会摇来晃去，我们连碰带撞还带摔，感觉真够糟的。然而，最后这一切都结束了，我们被用力拖起，晃回到了陆地上。我们都很高兴，再次踩到坚实的地面时，大家都纷纷喷鼻欢叫。

“很快，我们就发现我们来到的这个国家和我们自己的国家截然不同，除了战斗之外，我们还要忍受好多艰难困苦。但是，好多人都非常喜欢他们的马儿，所以他们竭尽所能让马儿在寒冷、潮湿，以及乱了章法的万物面前怡然自得。”

“但是，打仗怎样？”我说，“那不是比其他任何事儿都更糟吗？”

“啊，”他说，“我几乎不知道。我们总是喜欢听到号声响起，喜欢被派出去，迫不及待地出发，尽管有时为了等待命令不得不站好几个小时。当命令发出后，我们就会开开心心、迫不及待地跃步向前，好像根本没有炮弹、刺刀或子弹似的。我相信，只要我们感觉自己的骑手在马鞍上坐稳，他的手牢牢地抓住缰绳，我们就没有谁会害怕，即使空中有可怕的炸弹飞过，被炸成上千片，我们也不怕。

“我跟高贵的主人一起参加过好多行动，都没有受伤。尽管我也见过马儿中弹倒下，被长矛扎穿，被可怕的军刀砍伤，尽管我们任由他们死在战场，或者死于伤痛，但是我想我自己并不害怕。我的主人鼓舞他的士兵时声音欢快，让我认为他和我不可能被杀死。我对他完全信任，当他指挥我时，我就准备好去冲锋陷阵，堵住那个炮眼。我看到好多勇士都被砍倒，好多人摔下马鞍受了重伤。我听见过那些垂死的人发出的哭喊声和呻吟声。我曾经慢跑过鲜血流淌的地面，常常为了不踩到受伤的人或马而不停地腾挪，而却从来没有感到过恐惧。直到那可怕的一天到来——那是我永远难忘的一天。”

这时，老上尉暂停了一会儿，长吸了口气。我等着，他继续说了起来：

“那是一个秋天的早上，像平常一样，无论是要打仗还是要等候命令，拂晓前一小时，我们的骑兵团早已出来，披挂完毕。士兵们站在马旁，严阵以待。随着天色渐亮，军官们好像有些激动。天还没有完全亮，我们就听到敌人开火了。

“这时，一位军官骑过来，下令士兵们上马。于是大家纷纷上马，每一匹马都等着缰绳被触及，或被骑兵鞋跟压紧，我们一个个生龙活虎，跃跃欲试。但是，我们都受过良好的训练，除了时而咬咬嚼子，以及时不时不安地甩甩头之外，看不出我们焦躁。

“我和亲爱的主人站在队伍的最前面，大家都一动不动，目不转睛，他把我一小绺错位的鬃毛捋正，用手抚平，然后拍了拍我的脖子，说道：‘今天我们要打一天仗，巴亚德（骁勇者），我的美人儿。但是，我们会像以前那样尽职尽责。’那天早上，他拍我脖子的次数，比以前任何时候都多，他就这样一直静静地拍着，好像他在想其他事。我喜欢感受他的手放在我的脖子上，我骄傲而又高兴地弓起颈脊。不过，我站在那儿一动不动，因为我知道他所有的情绪，知道他什么时候想让我安静，什么时候想让我欢快。

“我说不清那天发生的一切，但是我可以讲述我们一块儿发起的最后一次冲锋。那就是穿越敌人炮火正前方的一个山谷。此时，我们完全习惯了附近隆隆的炮声、滑膛枪的嘎嘎声，以及子弹的嗖嗖声，而那天我们穿越的炮火却是我从来没有经历过的。子弹和炮弹从右边、左边、前面向我们倾泻而来。好多勇士纷纷倒下来，好多马纷纷倒下来，把骑兵摔倒在地。好多背上失去了骑手的马从队伍里狂奔出来。然而，因为害怕落单，加上没有人指挥，所以又跑回到了以前的伙伴中，跟他们一起冲锋陷阵。

“尽管非常可怕，但是谁都没有停下来，也没有后退。队伍人数每时每刻都在减少，而当我们的战友倒下时，我们就会围拢、团结在一起。当我们越来越接近大炮时，我们的步伐不仅没有动摇和犹豫，反而越来越快了。

“我的主人，我亲爱的主人正高举右手鼓舞他的战友们，这时一颗子弹从我的头边嗖地飞过，打中了他。尽管他没有发出喊叫，但是我感觉他受到打击摇晃了一下。我尽力控制速度，剑还是从他的右手里掉下，缰绳也从左手脱落，他在马鞍上向后一仰，摔落在地。其他骑兵从我们身边横扫而过，我被他们的冲力推离了现场。

“我想站在他的身边，不让飞驰而过的马蹄踩住他，却无济于事。我这时既没有主人，也没有朋友，孤零零地站在那个大杀戮场上，恐惧攫住了我，我浑身发抖，以前从来没有那样发抖过。就像我看到其他马儿做的那样，我也想尽力加入到队伍中，跟他们一起飞奔，但是我被士兵们的剑击退了。就在此时，一个失去战马的士兵一把抓住我的缰绳骑上了我，我和这个新主人一起又向前冲去。然而，我们英勇的连队寡不敌众，被打得惨败，那些从枪林弹雨中活下来的人又纷纷跑回了原地。有些马已经严重受伤了，因为失血过多几乎跑不动了，其他意志坚强的马儿设法靠三条腿拖行，还有一些马儿后腿被子弹打烂了，正挣扎着靠前蹄站起来。战斗结束后，伤员们被带了回去，牺牲的都被埋葬了。”

“那些受伤的马呢？”我问，“他们都留下来等死吗？”

“不是，部队的马医带着手枪走过来，射杀了所有受重伤的马。一些只受点儿轻伤的被抬带回去治疗，而早上出去的那些高贵、温驯的马儿大部分再也没有回来。我们马厩里回来的大约只有四分之一。

“我再也没有见到亲爱的主人。我相信他已经摔下马鞍倒地身亡了。我从来没有这样深爱过一个主人。我还参加了好多其他战斗，只受过一次伤，却并不严重。战争结束后，我又回到了英国，还像出国时一样健康强壮。”

我说：“我听别人说起过战争，就像那是一件非常美好的事儿。”

“啊！”他说，“我想他们从来没有见过战争。毫无疑问，没有敌人，仅仅训练训练，列队行进，演习一下，是很好。是的，那真不错。但是，当有成千上万的出色勇士和好马战死或终身残疾时，那就另当别论了。”

“你知道他们为什么打仗吗？”我问。

“不知道，”他说，“那不是一匹马所能明白的。但是，如果一路漂洋过海杀敌正确的话，那敌人一定是罪大恶极。”





第三十五章　杰里·巴克


我从来没有见过比新主人更好的人了。他和蔼善良，像约翰·曼利一样具有强烈的正义感；他心平气和，性情乐观，不大会有人寻衅跟他吵架。他非常喜欢编一些小曲，唱给自己听。他非常喜欢的是这首歌：

来吧，爸爸妈妈，

还有兄弟姐妹，

来啊，一起来吧，

你帮我来我帮你。

他们就是这样。哈里像年龄大的男孩子一样擅长干马厩里的活儿，而且总想去做力所能及的事儿。于是，波莉和多莉早上常常来帮忙收拾马车，刷刷和拍拍坐垫，擦擦玻璃，同时杰里在院子里给我们清洗，哈里在刷马具。他们之间常常有好多欢笑和乐趣，这比那些责骂或难听的话更能让我和上尉精神振奋。他们早上早早起来，因为杰里常常会唱：

假如你早上，

扔掉十分钟，

你整整一天，

都捡不回来。

你仓促匆忙，

忧虑又慌张，

你永远失去，

永远都泡汤。

他受不了毫无目的的闲逛和浪费时间，最让他生气的就是发现一些人总是迟到，为了弥补自己的懒散，他们要出租马拼命奔跑。

一天，两个看上去野里野气的年轻人从车站附近的酒馆里出来，召唤杰里。

“喂，车夫！赶快，我们有些晚了。加油，你把我们送到维多利亚车站，及时赶上一点钟的火车好吗？你会多得一先令。”

“先生们，我会以正常的速度送你们。像那样拼命，先令是赔偿不了的。”

拉里的马车就在我们的旁边。他猛地打开门，说道：“先生，我是你们需要的人！坐我的车，我的马儿会让你们正点到达那儿。”他为他们关好车门时，向杰里使了个眼色，说道：“超速快跑，违背良心。”随后，他狠狠地抽打自己疲惫不堪的马儿，拼命出发了。杰里拍了拍我的脖子说：“不，杰克，一先令补偿不了那种事儿，对吗，老伙计？”

尽管杰里坚决反对为讨好一些草率的人而拼命驾驶，但是他赶车一向不错，也不反对马力全开，他说只要他知道是为什么就行。

我清楚记得，一天早上，我们正在车站等乘客时，一个提着沉重旅行皮箱的年轻人踩到了人行道上的一块橘子皮，重重地摔倒在地。

杰里第一个跑过去，扶他站起来。他看起来好像很惊讶，他们把他扶进一家商店，他走起路来好像非常痛苦。当然，杰里又回到了站台。但是，大约十分钟后，一个店员大声叫他。于是，我们就停到了人行道上。

“你能把我送到东南火车站吗？”年轻人说，“我怕，这不幸的一跤已经让我误点了。但是，我不能错过十二点的火车，这对我至关重要。如果你能及时把我送到那儿，我会感激不尽，而且非常乐意多付你一些车费。”

杰里诚恳地说：“先生，如果你认为身体过得去的话，我会竭尽全力的。”因为看上去他脸色惨白，病恹恹的。

“我必须走，”他认真地说，“请打开门，让我们一刻也不要耽误。”

杰里立刻登上了驾驶座，向我愉悦地吆喝了一声，缰绳一拉，我就心领神会。

“喂，杰克，我的伙计，”他说，“飞跑吧，只要我们知道为什么，我们就要让他们看看我们是怎么飞过地面的。”

中午时分要在城里把车赶快总是很难，这时街上车水马龙。不过，我们还是竭尽所能。一个好车夫和一匹好马相互了解，同心协力，肯定能做得非常出色。我有一张很好的嘴巴——也就是说，稍微碰一下缰绳，我就能听从指挥。如果你想在中午时分快速穿过伦敦，就需要好多实践经验。

我和杰里习惯了这一点。如果我们下定决心穿过去，谁都快不过我们。我敏捷胆大，总能相信我的车夫；杰里动作快，同时又有耐心，相信自己的马儿。他很少用鞭子。当他想加快速度时，我会从他的语气和“驾驾”声中知道，也会通过缰绳知道要去哪儿，所以不用鞭打。不过，我必须言归正传。

那天街上水泄不通，而我们却一路走得相当顺畅，但是到了齐普赛街路口，却堵了三四分钟。年轻人伸出头，焦急地说：“我想我最好还是下车走吧。如果这样继续下去，我就永远赶不到那儿了。”

“先生，我会竭尽所能，”杰里说，“我认为我们还来得及。这次堵车不可能太久。再说，你的行李很重，你提不动的，先生。”

就在这时，我们前面的敞篷双轮车开始向前移动，随后我们漂亮转弯，穿街过巷，进进出出，拼命奔跑。说来奇怪，伦敦桥上居然畅通无阻，因为出租马车和四轮马车整个儿排成长队都跟着我们一路飞奔，也许都想去赶那趟火车。不管怎样，当大钟的指针指向十二点差八分时，我们和其他好多马车一起飞快地驶进了车站。

“谢天谢地！我们终于赶上了。”年轻人说，“感谢你，我的朋友，还有你的好马。你救了我，这是金钱无法回报的。收下这额外的二先令六便士。”

“不，先生，不，感谢你的美意。很高兴我们赶上了时间，先生。现在不要耽搁了，先生，铃响了。喂，搬运工！把这位先生的行李搬到——多佛线——十二点的火车上——就这样。”没等对方再说一个字，杰里就飞快地让我调过头，给其他在最后时刻冲过来的马车让路，我们停在一边，直到车流高峰期过去。

“真高兴！他说，“真高兴！可怜的小伙子！我不知道是什么让他这样焦急！”

杰里经常大声自言自语，我们不是在行进途中时，我都能听清他的话。

杰里回到站点后，大家对他拼命赶火车捞外快好一阵子嘲笑，他们说这一切违背了他的原则，他们想知道他捞了多少外快。

“比我平时赚的要多得多，”他狡黠地点了点头说，“他给我的能让我回去以后稍微舒服好几天。”

“胡说八道！”有个人说。

“他骗人，”另一个人说，“一边告诫我们，一边自己还是那样做。”

“喂，伙计们，”杰里说，“那位先生给了我两个半先令外快，但是我没有接。看到他赶上火车时欢天喜地的样子，对我就足够了。如果我和杰克想不时快跑一下自得其乐，那是我们自己的事儿，不是你们的事儿。”

“啊，”拉里说，“你永远都成不了富人。”

“很可能不会，”杰里说，“但是，我知道我不会因此而不快。我听人读过好多次戒律，但是我从来没有注意到任何一条说：‘你要做富人。’《新约》里有好多关于富人的新奇事儿。我想，如果我像他们那样，我认为那一定会让我感到有些不舒服。”

“如果你真的富有，”格兰特老板从他的马车顶上回过头说，“这是你应得的，杰里。你不会因财富而受到诅咒。至于你，拉里，你到死都会很穷。你鞭子用得太多了。”

“那么，”拉里说，“马不挨鞭子就不愿走，该怎么办？”

“你从来不费心去看看没有鞭子马儿会不会走路，你挥鞭的样子始终像胳膊得了小舞蹈病似的。如果这不让你筋疲力尽，就会让你的马筋疲力尽。你总是在换马，知道为什么吗？因为你从来不给他们任何安宁或鼓励。”

“唉，我运气不好，”拉里说，“这才是症结所在。”

“你永远不会好运，”老板说，“好运特别关照与她并驾齐驱的人，她通常喜欢那些有判断力、心肠好的人，至少这是我的经验。”

格兰特老板又转过去看起了报纸，其他人也回到了自己的车上。





第三十六章　礼拜天的出租马车


一天早上，杰里刚把我套进车辕，正在系挽绳时，一位先生走进了院子。“愿为你效劳，先生。”杰里说。

“早上好，巴克先生。”那位先生说，“我很高兴跟你商议礼拜天早上送布利格斯夫人去教堂一事。我们现在去新教堂，有些远，她无法步行去。”

“谢谢你，先生。”杰里说，“但是，我只取得了六天制营运执照(1)，所以礼拜天我不能载客，那是非法的。”

“噢！”那个人说，“我不知道你的是六天制马车，但是，变更一下执照肯定非常容易。我看这样做，你也不会有什么损失。事实上，布里格斯夫人非常喜欢由你为她驾车。”

“先生，我很高兴帮夫人的忙，而我也有过七天制执照，那活儿对我和我的马儿都太辛苦了。年复一年，没有一天休息，从来没有陪妻子和孩子们过过一个礼拜天，而且从来没有时间去做礼拜。我开始赶出租马车前，已经习惯礼拜天去教堂了。所以，最近五年，我只持六天制执照，发现这样在各方面都更好。”

“啊，当然。”布里格斯先生答道，“每个人都应该休息，礼拜天能去教堂，这合情合理，但是我想你不会介意这匹马跑这短短的一段路，再说一天只有一次。整个下午和晚上都是你的，你知道我们是很好的顾客。”

“是的，先生，这没错，我的确很感激所有的帮助，我可以为你和夫人效劳的任何事儿，我都应该自豪和高兴地去做。不过，先生，我不能放弃我的星期天，真的不能。我在书上读过，上帝造人，他也造了马和其他所有动物。一造好这些生灵，他就定下了一个休息日，还下令七天里大家都要休息一天。所以，先生，我认为上帝一定知道这对他们有什么好处，我也相信这对我有好处。因为我有一天休息，所以我更加强壮、健康了。马儿也精神抖擞，不会很快就筋疲力尽。六天制赶车人都这样对我说，我在银行里的存款也比以前多了。至于妻子和孩子们，先生——啊，都很开心！他们无论如何也不愿我再回到七天制工作状态了。”

“噢，很好。”那位先生说，“别再费心了，巴克先生。我到别处去打听一下。”说完，他就走了。

“唉，”杰里对我说，“我们无能为力，杰克，老伙计。我们必须有自己的礼拜天。”

“波莉！”他叫道，“波莉！过来。”

波莉立马就来了。

“这一切是怎么回事，杰里？”

“啊，亲爱的，布里格斯先生想要我每个礼拜天上午都送布里格斯夫人去做礼拜。我说我只有六天制营运执照。他说：‘办个七天制营运执照，我会酬谢你。’波莉，你知道，他们是我们很好的顾客。布里格斯夫人经常出去买东西或拜访，一去就是几个小时，然后当场付钱，公平体面，像个淑女。从来不会杀价，也不会像有些人那样把三个小时说成是两个半小时，对马儿来说也轻松自在，不用为那些迟到十五分钟的人一路狂奔去赶火车。如果我在这件事上不帮她的忙，我们很可能就会完全做不成他们的生意。你说说看，老婆？”

“我说，杰里，”她缓缓地说，“我说，即使布里格斯夫人每个礼拜天早上给你一枚金币，我也不愿你再做七天制车夫。我们早已知道没有礼拜天是什么滋味了，现在我们才知道有自己的礼拜天是什么样子。谢天谢地，你赚的钱够养活我们了，尽管有时买燕麦、干草，再加上交营运执照年费和租金等等日子紧巴巴的，但是，哈里很快就能赚钱了，所以我宁愿再辛苦点儿，也不愿回到那些可怕的日子了。你差不多连看一眼自己孩子的时间都没有，我们也从来不能一起去做礼拜，不能有一天快乐安宁的日子。我们千万不要再回到那些日子了，我就说这些，杰里。”

“我就是这样告诉布里格斯先生的，亲爱的，”杰里说，“这也是我想要坚持的。所以，波莉，别再去烦恼了，”因为她已经开始哭了，“就是赚两倍的钱，我也不会再回到从前的日子了，所以放心吧，老婆。好了，打起精神，我要去车站了。”

这次对话后，三周已经过去了，布里格斯夫人没有再订过车，所以只有从车站接活。杰里对此非常痛心，因为人和马肯定更辛苦。但是，波莉总是给他鼓劲，说：“不用担心，他爸，不用担心：

竭尽全力，

不及其余，

有朝一日，

万事顺利。”

很快，大家就知道杰里是因为什么失去了他最好的顾客。大多数人都说他是傻瓜，但还是有两三个人支持他。

“如果劳工们都不坚守自己的礼拜天，”杜鲁门说，“那他们很快就会一无所有。这是每个人的权利，也是每个动物的权利。根据上帝的法律，我们要有一天休息；根据英国的法律，我们也要有一天休息。我要说，我们应该坚持这些法律赋予我们的权利，并为我们的孩子们保住这些权利。”

“你们这些信教的家伙这样说顶好，”拉里说，“但是，我能赚一先令就会去赚一先令。我不相信宗教，因为我看你们这些信教的人比其他人好不到哪儿去。”

“如果他们好不到哪儿去，”杰里插话说，“那是因为他们并不虔诚。你也许会说我们国家的法律不健全，因为有人会违法。如果一个人爱发脾气，诽谤邻居，欠债不还，不管他做多少次礼拜，都不是虔诚的教徒。就是有些人弄虚作假，那也不会把宗教变成假的。真正的宗教是世界上最好、最真的东西，也是唯一能让人感到真正快乐和让我们生活的世界变得更好的东西。”

“无论如何，如果说宗教有好处的话，”琼斯说，“那它就会阻止你们那些教徒迫使我们礼拜天工作，你们知道他们当中好多人都这样做，这就是我说宗教只是骗人的原因——啊，要不是有人去教堂礼拜，我们根本不值得礼拜天出门。但是，他们有他们所谓的特权，而我却没有。如果我没有机会拯救自己的灵魂，那就指望他们为我的灵魂负责了。”

好几个人为此鼓起了掌，随后杰里说道：

“尽管这听上去没错，但却行不通。每个人必须照顾自己的灵魂，你不能把它像弃婴一样放在别人的门口，指望别人来照顾它。你不明白，如果你总是坐在驾驶座上等乘客，他们就会说：‘如果我们不坐他的马车，别人就会坐，他也不希望有什么礼拜天。’当然，他们没有弄清事情的真相，否则他们就会明白，如果他们从来不坐马车，你站在那儿是不会有用的。然而，人们总是不想弄清事情的真相。这样做也许不便。但是，如果你们礼拜天工作的车夫都罢工要求休息一天，事情不就搞定了嘛。”

“如果所有的好人都去不了他们中意的传教士那儿，他们该怎么办？”拉里说。

“我不能为别人制订计划，”杰里说，“但是，如果他们走不了很远，他们可以去较近的地方；如果下雨，他们就可以像平日那样穿上雨衣。如果一件事正确，就可以去做；如果一件事错误，就可以不做。一个好人总会找到办法。这无论是对我们马车夫还是对去教堂礼拜的人都像真理一样。”

第三十七章　金科玉律


之后，又过了两三周，一天深夜，我们走进院子时，波莉提着灯笼穿过大路跑了过来（如果天不下雨，她总是提着灯笼给杰里照明）。

“杰里，一切都好起来了，布里格斯夫人今天下午派仆人过来让你明天十一点送她出去。我说：‘行，我想可以，我们还以为她现在雇用别人了呢。’

“‘啊，’他说，‘真实情况是，巴克先生拒绝礼拜天出车，主人非常生气。他一直在尝试用别的出租马车，但是他们都有毛病，有的驾得太快，有些驾得太慢，夫人说没有一个像你的马车一样漂亮干净，只有巴克先生的马车最适合她。’”

波莉快要喘不过气来了，杰里突然欢笑了起来。

“‘有朝一日，万事顺利。’你说得对，亲爱的，你一向说得对。跑进去把晚饭端来，我要取下杰克的马具，让他立刻舒适、开心一下。”

这之后，布里格斯夫人像以前一样频繁地乘坐杰里的车，却从来没有在礼拜天乘坐过。不过，有一天，我们在礼拜天也干了活，情况是这样的：星期六夜里，我们回到家里，都很累，但是想到第二天可以好好休息就非常高兴，而情况并不是这样。

礼拜天早上，杰里正在院子里给我清洗，这时波莉走到他的身边，看上去忧心忡忡。

“怎么了？”杰里说。

“噢，亲爱的，”她说，“可怜的戴娜·布朗刚让人送来一封信，说她的妈妈病危，如果她还想见到活着的她的话，就必须马上去。那个地方距离这儿有十多英里，是在乡下。她说，如果她坐火车去，还要步行四英里。她身体非常虚弱，婴儿才四个星期大，那肯定不可能，所以她想知道你愿不愿拉她去，她承诺她一有钱就会如数付给你。”

“啧，啧！我们看看再说吧。我想的不是钱，而是想会失去礼拜天。马很累，我也很累——这才是症结所在。”

“这件事非常棘手，”波莉说，“不过你不在，礼拜天就没了一半。你也知道，我们想要别人怎么对待我们，就应该怎么对待别人。我非常清楚，如果我的母亲奄奄一息，我就会想要什么。所以，杰里，亲爱的，我相信那不是不守安息日，因为如果我们把一头可怜的动物或驴子拉出陷阱，不会破坏安息日的话，我就完全相信送可怜的戴娜也不会破坏安息日。”

“啊，波莉，你像牧师一样善良。这样吧，既然今天我已经听过礼拜天早晨的布道，你可以去告诉戴娜，我会在大钟敲响十下时为她准备停当。不过，等一下——请顺路带去我对布雷顿肉铺的问候，问他能不能把他那辆双轮轻便马车借给我，我知道他礼拜天从来不用它。这对那匹马来说将会截然不同，大有裨益。”

她去了，很快就返回来，说他可以随意使用那辆双轮轻便马车。

“好吧，”他说，“现在给我准备一点儿面包和奶酪，我会尽可能下午回来。”

“我会准备好早茶吃的肉馅饼，而不是晚餐。”说完，波莉就走了。这时，杰里哼起《波莉真有女人味》的小曲，他非常喜欢这个小曲。

他选我来跑这趟路，十点钟我们就拉着一辆轻便高轮马车出发了，高轮马车拉起来轻松自如，跟四轮马车相比仿佛再好不过了。

那是五月的一个晴天，我们一出城，芬芳的空气、鲜草的气息和松软的乡路都让我心旷神怡，好像回到了过去的岁月，所以我很快就开始感到精神抖擞。

戴娜的家人住在一个小农舍里，农舍位于一条绿色小路的尽头，靠近一个绿树成荫的牧场。那儿有两头牛正在吃草。一个年轻人让杰里把马车赶进牧场，拴在牛棚里，他说他真希望能提供一个更好的马厩。

“如果你的奶牛不会受到冒犯的话，”杰里说，“没有什么比在你这美丽的牧场上待一两个小时更让我的马儿欢喜的了。他很安分，而这也是对他少有的款待。”

“牵来吧，别客气。”年轻人说，“你对我的姐姐这样好，我们最乐意帮助你。我们一小时后就要吃饭，我希望你进来跟我们一起吃，尽管妈妈病情严重，我们全家都不开心。”

杰里对他表示衷心的感谢，说自己随身带有吃的，他最想做的就是在牧场四处走走。

我身上的马具取下后，我不知道应该先做什么——是吃草还是打滚儿，是躺下休息还是自由自在地尽情奔跑在草地上。这一切我都轮流做了一遍。杰里看上去跟我一样非常高兴，他在岸边的一棵成荫的树下坐下来，听着鸟鸣，然后自己也唱了起来，接着读起了那本他非常喜欢的棕色封面的小书，随后绕着牧场漫步，沿着小溪走，在那儿他摘了一些鲜花和山楂果，用长长的常青藤条束起来。接下来，他让我好好吃了一顿随身带来的燕麦。但是，时间好像太短了——自从离开伯爵府和可怜的姜姐，我就没有到过田野。

我们慢悠悠地回家了。当我们走到院子里时，杰里首先这样说道：“啊，波莉，我终究没有失去礼拜天，因为每一片灌木丛中都总有鸟儿在唱圣歌，我也一起做了礼拜。至于杰克，他就像一匹小马驹似的。”

当他把鲜花递给多莉时，她开心地跳起舞来。





第三十八章　多莉和真君子


冬天早早地来了，天气非常寒冷潮湿。一连几个星期，每天不是下雪就是下雨，要么就是雨夹雪，就是有所变化，也只是刺骨的大风天或是凛冽的霜冻。马儿们都切身体会到了这一点。当天气干冷时，两块厚旅行毛毯就会让我们保暖，而当大雨袭来时，这些毯子很快就会湿透，盖着反而没有任何好处。有些车夫会在我们的身上盖一块防水布，那是一个好东西，但是，有些马夫很穷，既没有能力保护自己，也没有能力保护他们的马儿。那年冬天，马夫中的好多人都饱受煎熬。工作半天之后，我们马儿就可以到干燥的马厩休息，而他们马夫还得坐在驾驶座上等，如果是等一个宴会的话，有时就要等到凌晨一两点钟。

冰天雪地街上很滑，那对我们马儿来说最糟糕。这样负重走一英里，蹄踩不坚实，比在好路上跑四英里还要费劲儿。为了保持平衡，我们身体的每根神经和每块肌肉都绷得紧紧的。此外，对摔跤的忧虑比其他任何东西都更让马儿耗力。如果路面真的很糟，我们的蹄铁就会装防滑钉，而刚开始这让我们神经紧张。

天气很差时，好多人常常会坐在附近的酒馆里，让别人替他们守候。但是，那样他们往往会错过乘客，而且，就像杰里说的那样，在那儿不可能不花钱。他从来不去日出酒家，附近有一家咖啡店，他偶尔去那儿，或者向一个来我们这儿卖热咖啡和馅饼的老头购买。他认为，烈酒和啤酒过后会让人更冷，让车夫保暖的最好的东西是干爽的衣服、可口的食物、快乐的心情和家里体贴的妻子。他不能回家时，波莉就会给他提供吃的，有时他会看到小多莉从街角那边偷看，以确定爸爸在不在车站。如果看到了爸爸，她就会飞快地跑开，很快拿着罐子或提着篮子跑回来，里面盛着波莉准备好的热汤或布丁。这么一个小东西能安全穿过常常车马成群的街道，真是令人惊奇。然而，她是一个勇敢的小姑娘，感到给爸爸送他所谓的“第一道菜”是她的无上光荣。她在车站上很受欢迎，如果杰里不能送她安全过街，所有人都愿代劳。

一个寒冷的风天，多莉给杰里送来了一盆热气腾腾的东西，他吃时她站在旁边。他刚要开始吃，一位先生飞快地走向我们，举起了伞。杰里也碰了碰帽子作为回应，把盆递给了多莉，正要拿掉我身上的布，这时那位先生赶紧走上来，叫道：“不，不，喝完汤，我的朋友。尽管我抽不出多少时间，但是我可以等你把汤喝完，再把你的小姑娘送到人行道上。”这样说着，他自己坐进了马车。杰里向他表示了衷心的感谢，然后又回到了多莉的身边。

“你瞧，多莉，这是一位绅士，一位真正的绅士，多莉。他还有时间为一位穷车夫和一个小女孩的舒适考虑。”

杰里喝完汤，把孩子送过街道，然后按照吩咐，驱车去了克拉珀姆高地。这之后，这位先生又坐了好几次我们的车。我想他非常喜欢狗和马，因为每当我们把他送到家门口时，两三条狗就会跳出来迎接他。有时他会走过来拍拍我，用平静愉悦的口吻说道：“这马儿有一个好主人，他也应该有一个好主人。”很少有人会注意到一匹一直为他做事的马儿。我知道女士们偶尔会这样做，这位先生，以及其他一两位也曾拍过我，对我说过体贴的话，但是，百分之九十九的人宁愿想起去拍一台拉火车的蒸汽机。

那位先生不大年轻了，肩膀向前倾，就像他总是扑向什么东西似的。他的嘴唇薄薄的，紧闭着，但是脸上带着非常愉快的微笑。他的眼神敏锐，下巴和头部的动作让人觉得他做任何事情都非常坚决。他的声音亲切悦耳，任何马儿都会信任那种声音，尽管那声音像和他有关的其他一切那样坚定。

一天，他和另一位先生一起坐我们的车。他们在R街的一家商店前停下来，他的朋友进去时，他站在门口。在我们街对面稍靠前一点儿的地方，两匹非常漂亮的马拉着一辆车，正站在酒店前。车夫没有跟他们在一起，我说不清他们已经站了多久，但是他们好像以为自己等的时间已经够长了，就准备离开。他们还没走几步，车夫就跑出来，抓住了他们。看到他们移动，车夫好像勃然大怒，拿起鞭子和缰绳狠狠地惩罚他们，甚至还打他们的脑袋。我们的那位先生看到这一切，快步走过街道，声音果断地说道：

“如果你不立即住手，我就要以你离开自己的马和行为粗暴让人逮捕你。”

那个人明显是喝醉了，滔滔不绝地骂了一些脏话，但是不再打马，他拉起缰绳，上了马车。与此同时，我们的朋友面色平静地从口袋里掏出笔记本，看了看马车上的名字和地址，记下了什么。

“你记那个干吗？”车夫一边挥鞭前进，一边吼道。他得到的回应只是点头和冷笑。

返回马车时，我们的朋友和他的同伴走到一起，他的同伴大声笑道：“赖特，我本以为你自己操心的事儿够多了，不会费心去管别人的马和仆人了呢。”

我们的朋友一动不动站了一会儿，头稍微后仰：“你知道这个世界为什么像现在这样糟糕吗？”

“不知道。”另一个人说。

“那我告诉你。那是因为人们只想着自己的事儿，不愿费心去支持受压迫者，也不愿揭露那些作恶者。看到这种坏事，我绝不会袖手旁观，好多主人感谢我让他们知道自己的马受到了怎样的虐待。”

“先生，我真希望有更多像你一样的绅士，”杰里说，“因为这个城市迫切需要你们。”

之后，我们继续赶路。当他们下车时，他说：“这就是我的原则，如果我们看到残忍或错误之事，有能力阻止却毫无作为，那我们自己也会成为罪人。”





第三十九章　破衣萨姆


应该说，作为一匹拉出租车的马，我的确处境很好。我的车夫是我的主人，即使他不是那么好的人，善待我、不让我过分劳累也符合他的利益。但是，好多马都是那些马车大老板的，他们以每天很高的价格把马车租给车夫。因为那些马不属于这些车夫，所以他们只想着从马身上赚钱，先付给老板，然后养家糊口。其中一些马的日子非常艰难。当然，我只理解一点点儿，但是车站上常常讨论这件事儿。老板是一个心地善良而又喜欢马儿的人，如果看到马筋疲力尽或受到虐待，他就会大声呼吁。

一天，一个名叫“破衣萨姆”的车夫牵马过来，他衣衫褴褛，可怜巴巴，看上去那匹马受到过狠狠的抽打。老板说：

“你和你的马更适合去警察局，而不是来这个地方。”

那个人把他那块破毯子扔在马身上，完全转向老板，以听上去近乎绝望的声音说：

“如果警察跟这件事儿有关的话，那应该是跟向我们要价太高的老板们有关，或者是跟定得太低的车费有关。如果一个人不得不像当下我们中的好多人一样每天得付十八先令才能使用一辆车和两匹马，而且必须付清这些钱，我们才会为自己赚钱，那我要说这就不仅仅是辛苦了。每天开始谋生之前，要先从每匹马身上赚九先令。你知道那是实情，如果马儿不工作，我们就一定会饿死，我和孩子们之前都已经知道那意味着什么。我有六个孩子，只有一个能赚点钱。我每天要在车站待十四或十六个小时，有十或十二周没有歇过一个礼拜天了。你知道斯金纳只要掌势就从来不给一天休息时间，如果我不辛苦工作，告诉我谁辛苦工作！我想要保暖外套和雨衣，但是我要养活这么多张嘴，怎么能买得起呢？一周前，为了付给斯金纳租金，我不得不典当自己的钟表，所以我再也见不到它了。”

其他一些站在四周的车夫都点头称是。那个人继续说道：

“如果你们有自己的马和车，或者为好心的车主驾车，就有机会过好日子，也有机会做对事情；我却没有。在四英里范围内，跑完一英里后的每英里，我们收费不能超过六便士。今天早上我不得不跑了整整六英里，就赚了三先令。我返程没有乘客，只好一路空车回来。马儿跑了十二英里，我就赚了三先令。这之后，我有一笔三英里的生意，如果提包和箱子放在外面，我足足可以多赚两便士之多。但是，你知道人们是怎么做的。所有能放在前座上的东西都堆了进来，三只沉甸甸的箱子压在最上面。东西是六便士，车费是一先令六便士。后来，我回程时赚了一先令。现在马儿跑了十八英里，我赚了六先令。那匹马还要赚三先令，下午的马再赚九先令，我才能摸到一便士。当然，也并不总是那样糟糕，但是你知道经常是这样。所以我说告诉一个人不要让马儿劳累过度是一个笑柄，因为当一头畜生筋疲力尽时，只有鞭子会使他抬腿前进。你无能为力——你必须先考虑妻子和孩子，再考虑马儿，车主们必须注意这一点，我们不能。我不是为了这个而虐马。你们谁也不能说我虐待马。某个地方不妥——从来没有休息一天——没有跟妻子和孩子们安生过过一个小时。我常常觉得自己垂垂老矣，尽管我才四十五岁。你知道有些贵族多么性急，他们怀疑我们骗人，多收费。唉，他们手里拿着钱包，站在那儿一便士一便士地数钱，拿眼看着我们，就像我们是扒手似的。我真希望他们有些人每天都能风雨无阻地在我的车上坐十六个小时，这样赚的钱除了交十八先令，才能谋生，这样他们就不会做出从来不多付六便士或把所有行李都塞进车里这种稀罕事了。还好，有些人会不时给我们一些相当可观的小费，否则我们就活不下去。但是，你不能总指望这个。”

那些站在四周的人都非常赞成这个说法，其中一个人说：“这种辛苦真让人绝望。一个人偶尔做错事，倒也不奇怪，但是如果他喝多了，谁会去对他发脾气呢？”

杰里没有加入这次谈话，但是我以前从来没有看到他的脸色如此悲伤。老板刚才站在那儿两手插进口袋，现在从帽子里拿出手帕擦了擦前额。

“你驳倒了我，萨姆，”他说，“因为这都是事实，我再也不会拿警察来跟你说事儿了。刚才是那匹马的眼神刺激了我。这是人的不幸，也是马的不幸，我不知道谁会改正这一点。但是不管怎样，你可以告诉这个可怜的马儿，这样使唤他，你感到难过。有时，一句好话就是我们能给这些可怜的畜生的一切，如果他们真正明白，那就太好了。”

这次谈话几天后的一天早上，一个新人拉着萨姆的马车来到车站。

“喂！”有个人说，“破衣萨姆怎么了？”

“他卧病在床，”那个人说，“他昨晚在院子里病倒了，几乎爬不回家。他的妻子今天早上派一个男孩子来说他的爸爸在发高烧，出不了车，所以我就来替他。”

第二天早上，那个人又来了。

“萨姆怎么样了？”老板问。

“他走了。”那个人说。

“什么，走了？你不是说他死了吧？”

“刚断气，”那个人说，“他是今天凌晨四点死的。昨天一整天他都在说胡话——语无伦次地说斯金纳，说没有礼拜天。‘我从来没有休过一个礼拜天。’这就是他临终的话。”

好一阵子，谁都没有说话。随后，老板说道：“伙计们，我告诉你们什么呢，这就是对我们的警告。”





第四十章　可怜的姜姐


一天，我们的马车和好多其他马车一起在一个音乐表演的公园外等候，这时一辆破旧马车停到了我们的车边。拉车的是一匹疲惫不堪的栗色老马，毛皮保养得很差，瘦骨嶙峋，膝盖弯曲，前腿摇摇晃晃。我一直在吃干草，风把一小簇干草卷到了那个方向，可怜的老马伸出瘦长的脖子衔起，然后转过头，环顾四周想再找一些。她黯然无神的眼睛充满绝望，我不禁注意起她来。这时，我在想着我以前曾在哪儿见过这匹马，她仔细打量着我，说：“黑骏马，是你吗？”

是姜姐！可是，变化真大啊！原来优美弯曲、富有光泽的脖子现在平直、细瘦、凹陷；原来整齐挺拔的腿和精致的球节肿胀了起来，关节部位因辛苦劳作而变形；原来意气风发的脸现在饱经沧桑，而且从她上下起伏的肋部和频繁的咳嗽声中，我可以看出她的呼吸是多么糟糕。

我们的车夫们一起站在一小段距离开外。于是，我悄悄地向她走了一两步，这样我们就可以小声说话了。她讲述的是一段悲惨的故事。

在伯爵府进行了十二个月的跑步康复训练之后，他们认为她又适合去干活了，就把她卖给了一位先生。有一小阵子，她过得很好，但是跑得比平时久了，她就会旧病复发，所以经过休息和治疗之后，她又被卖了。就这样，她被转了好几次手，但一次不如一次。

“就这样，最后，”她说，“我被一个拥有好多车马做出租之用的人买下了。看上去你身体健康，我很高兴，但是我过的日子无法跟你说啊。当他们发现我的毛病时，他们就说我不值他们出的价，所以我必须去拉低等级的马车，就是要让我筋疲力尽。他们就是这样干的，他们拿鞭子抽我，让我干活，从来没有一个人想过我遭受的痛苦——他们说他们花钱买我，必须把这个钱从我的身上赚回来。那个现在租我的人每天都要向老板付一大笔钱，所以他必须得把这钱从我的身上赚回来。就这样，一周又一周，礼拜天我从来没有休息过。”

我说：“你过去一向是一受到虐待就捍卫自己的啊。”

“啊！”她说，“我做过一次，但是那没用。人最强大，如果他们冷酷无情，我们就只能忍受，忍啊忍，直到死去。我真希望死期来临，我真希望自己死去。我见过死马，我相信他们不受苦了。我真希望我在干活时倒地身亡，而不是被送到屠马场。”

我非常难过，把鼻子凑到她的鼻子上，但是我说不出一句安慰她的话来。我想她见到我很高兴，因为她说：“你是我有生以来唯一的朋友。”

就在这时，她的车夫走过来，一把拽住她的嘴，将她牵离了马车队伍，驱车而去，留下我难过不已。

不久之后，一辆载着一头死马的双轮马车经过我们的出租车停车场。马头耷拉在车尾，毫无生气的舌头慢慢地滴着血，眼睛凹陷。但是，我难以诉说，那情景是多么可怕。那是一匹脖子瘦长的栗色马。我看到额头下面有一道白色条纹。我相信那是姜姐，我希望是她，因为那样的话，她的痛苦就会结束了。噢！如果人们更仁慈的话，他们就应该在我们沦落到如此惨境之前开枪打死我们。





第四十一章　肉铺


我看到的那些伦敦马当中的好多麻烦，大多是可以靠一点儿常识来避免的。如果我们马儿受到合理的对待，就不会介意辛苦工作。我相信，好多给穷人拉车的马儿比我过去常常佩戴着镶银马具、吃着高级食物给W伯爵夫人拉车时开心。

看到那些小马吃力地拉着重物或在粗俗残忍的男孩子的重击下蹒跚而行，常常让我伤心。有一次，我看到一匹小灰马，只见他长着浓密的鬃毛和漂亮的脑袋，酷似快乐腿，如果我的身上没有马具，我就会对他嘶叫。他正在竭尽全力拉一辆重车，而一个强壮粗鲁的男孩子正用鞭子狠狠地抽打他的腹部，残忍地敲他的小嘴。这会是快乐腿吗？就是像他。不过，布罗姆菲尔德先生绝不会卖他，我想他不会这样做。但是，这匹马很可能是一匹好马，小时候也有一个快乐的成长环境。

我常常注意到肉铺的马被赶得飞快，尽管我不知道为什么，直到有一天，我们在圣约翰林场等了一段时间，才明白是怎么回事。隔壁是一家肉铺，我们正站在那儿时，肉铺的一辆马车飞奔而来。那匹马热汗淋淋，筋疲力尽，耷拉着脑袋，他上下起伏的肋部和颤抖的腿表明，他被赶得是多么猛烈。那个小伙子跳下马车，拿出篮子，老板从店里走出来，一脸不快。他看了看马之后，生气地转向小伙子。

“我对你说多少次了，不要这样赶车？你毁了上一匹马，损坏了他的呼吸系统，你又要以同样的方式毁了这匹马。你要不是我的亲生儿子，我就会当场解雇你。你把一匹赶成这种状况的马带回店里，真丢人。你这样驾驶很可能会被警察带走，你要是被带走，不要指望我保你，因为我对你说已经说烦了，你必须自己当心。”

说这话时，那个男孩子站在旁边，脸色阴沉，态度顽固，而他的父亲一停住话头，他就突然发起了火。这不是他的过错，他不应该承担过错。他始终只是在奉命行事。

“你总是说：‘喂，快点；喂，赶快！’我去那些人家时，一家想要一条羊腿早做晚饭，我必须十五分钟内赶回来；另一家厨师忘了订牛肉，我必须取来送去，然后立刻赶回，否则夫人就要责骂；那个主妇说，他们家里来了不速之客，必须马上送去一些排骨；住在新月街四号的那位女士，不等到午餐肉送到，就从来不订晚餐肉。所以，一直就是匆匆忙忙赶来赶去。如果那些贵族事先想好他们要什么，提前一天预订好他们要的肉，你就不用这样斥责我了！”

“但愿他们会，”屠夫说，“如果事先知道，我就不用这样莫名其妙地烦恼，还能更好地让顾客满意——可是，你看——说有什么用——谁会考虑一个卖肉的方便，谁会考虑肉铺的马呢？得了，把他牵进来，好好照顾他，记住，他今天不能再出去了。如果他们还要别的什么，你就提着篮子自己去。”说完，他就走了进去，马被牵走了。

不过，并不是所有的男孩子都冷酷无情。我见过一些男孩子喜欢他们的马驹或驴子，就像宠爱小狗一样，而且那些小家伙为他们的年轻车夫不停地连续工作，就像我现在为杰里工作一样心甘情愿、高高兴兴。尽管有时干活很苦，但是朋友的抚摸和话语会让一切轻松自如。

有一个年轻小贩拉着青菜和土豆来到我们的街上，他有一匹老矮种马，长得不很好看，但却是我见过的最快乐、最勇敢的矮种马，看到他们俩相互那样喜欢，真让人高兴。那匹马像狗一样跟着他的主人。男孩子坐上马车后，不用鞭子，不用说话，小马就会一路小跑，快乐地穿街而过，好像他是从王后的马厩里出来似的。杰里喜欢那个男孩子，叫他“查理王子”，因为他说他有朝一日会成为车夫王。

还有一位老人以前常常拉着一辆小煤车来到我们的街上，他戴着一顶运煤工的帽子，看上去粗糙黝黑。他和他的老马常常一起沿街慢行，就像两个互相了解的好伴侣。那匹马常常会主动在门口停下来，让他们卸煤。他常常让一只耳朵弯向主人。老人还没走近，整条街就能听到他的喊声。我从来不知道他说的是什么，但是小孩子们都叫他“老巴呼”，因为他的声音听上去像是那样。波莉非常友好地从他那儿买煤，杰里说想到一匹老马能在一个穷地方这样快乐，真是一种安慰。





第四十二章　选举


一天下午，我们进院子时，波莉走了出来。“杰里！B先生来我这儿问你选票的事儿，他想租你的马车去选举，他要等你的回话。”

“啊，波莉，你可以说我的马车另有用场。我不喜欢马车上贴满他们的大海报，还要让杰克和上尉跑到那些酒馆去接那些喝得半醉的投票人，啊，我认为那对马儿是一种侮辱。不，我不会那样做。”

“我想你会给那位先生投票吧？他说他跟你的政治立场一致。”

“在有些事儿上是一致的，但我不会为他投票，波莉。你知道他是做什么生意的吗？”

“知道。”

“那么，一个靠做这一行致富的人在有些方面好倒是好，但是他对劳动人民的需要视而不见。照我的良心，我不能推举他去制定法律。我敢说他们会生气，但是每个人都必须做他认为对国家最好的事儿。”

选举前的那天早上，杰里正把我套进车辕，这时多莉呜呜哭着走进院子，她的蓝色小上衣和白围裙上溅满了泥点。

“啊，多莉，怎么了？”

“那些顽皮的男孩子，”她哭诉道，“朝我身上扔泥土，还叫我小邋——遢——”

“爸爸，他们都叫她‘蓝色小邋遢’。”哈里非常生气地跑进来说，“不过，我已经回敬他们了。他们不会再侮辱妹妹了。我痛打了他们一顿，他们一定会记住的。一伙胆小、无赖的橙色流氓。”

杰里亲了亲孩子，说道：“宝贝儿，跑去妈妈那儿，告诉她，我觉得今天你最好待在家里帮她。”

随后，杰里神情严肃地转向哈里：

“我的孩子，我希望你会永远保护你的妹妹，无论是谁侮辱她，你都要狠狠地揍他一顿——就应该这样。但是，记住，我不会让人在我的地皮上耍流氓选举。世界上有好多蓝色流氓、橙色流氓，也有白色流氓、紫色流氓或其他颜色的流氓，但是我不会让自己的家人掺和进去。哪怕是妇女和孩子都乐意因一种颜色而跟别人争吵，但是他们中知道那颜色代表什么的人不到十分之一。”

“啊，爸爸，我还以为蓝色代表自由。”

“我的孩子，自由并非来自颜色，颜色只代表政党。你们从这些颜色中能得到的所有自由，就是有花别人的钱喝醉的自由，有坐着一辆肮脏旧马车去投选票的自由，有谩骂任何不穿你们党派颜色衣服的人、声嘶力竭地呼喊你似懂非懂的话语的自由——这就是你的自由！”

“噢，爸爸，你在开玩笑吧。”

“不，哈里，我是认真的，看到人们本不该上当却继续上当，真让人感到害臊。选举是一件非常严肃的事儿。至少应该如此，每个人都应该凭良心投票，并让他的邻居也这样做。”





第四十三章　患难之交


选举日终于到来了，我和杰里不缺活干。起初，来了一个身体矮胖、手提毛毡提包的先生，他想去主教门车站。随后，我们被一群想让我们送去摄政者公园的人叫住。接下来，我们在一条小巷里受到征用，因为那儿有一位胆怯、焦虑的老太太正在等着被送去银行，我们不得不又停下来，把她送回原地。我们刚让她下车，一位满面通红的先生就拿着一沓纸气喘吁吁地跑过来。还没等杰里下车，他就已经打开了门，突然坐进来，大声喊道：“弓街警察局，快！”于是，我们载他而去，又送了一两趟后，回到了车站，车站上没有其他马车。杰里给我戴上粮袋，因为就像他所说：“在像这样的日子，我们必须伺机吃东西，杰克，就这样用力咀嚼吧，充分利用时间，老伙计。”

我发现我吃的是用糠兑湿的碎燕麦的好料。这在任何时候都会是一种款待，而另一方面在当时还非常提神。杰里是那样体贴、善良——哪匹马不愿为这样的主人竭尽全力呢？随后，他拿出波莉准备的一张肉馅饼，站在我的旁边，开始吃了起来。街上水泄不通，那些涂有候选人颜色的马车在人群中横冲直撞，好像人的性命无足轻重似的。那天，我们看到有两个人被撞倒，其中一个是妇女。那些马是在遭罪，可怜的牲畜！但是，那些坐在车里的投票人根本没有想到这一点。其中好多人喝得半醉，如果他们自己党派的人经过，他们就会从马车窗里伸出头来欢呼。那是我见到的第一次选举，尽管我听说现在情况有所好转，但我还是不想再参加第二次。

我和杰里还没吃几口，一个可怜的年轻女人就沿街走来，只见她抱着一个沉甸甸的孩子。她左顾右盼，好像手足无措。不一会儿，她向杰里走来，问他能否告诉她去圣托马斯医院的路，到那儿有多远。她说，她那天早上坐着赶集的马车从乡下来，不知道选举的事儿，对伦敦完全不熟悉。医生吩咐她带小男孩去那家医院。孩子难受，哭得有气无力。

“可怜的小家伙！”她说，“他疼得受不了了。他四岁了，走路还像婴儿一样，不过，医生说，如果我能把他送进那家医院，他就可能会康复。求求你，先生，有多远，走哪条路？”

“唉，夫人，”杰里说，“你不可能步行穿过这样的人群到那儿的！唉，距离有三英里，这孩子很沉。”

“是的，哎呀，他很沉，但是，我强壮，感谢上帝，只要我知道路，我想我都会设法前进。请把路告诉我吧。”

“你做不到，”杰里说，“你可能会被撞倒，孩子也可能会被轧到。听我说，请上这辆车吧，我会把你安全送到医院。你没看见天要下雨了吗？”

“不，先生，不，我不能这样做，谢谢你，我带的钱只够回去用的。请告诉我路吧。”

“听我说，夫人，”杰里说，“我家里也有妻子和可爱的孩子，我知道一位父亲的感受。现在你坐上车，我免费送你去那儿。让一个女人和一个生病的孩子冒这样的险，我会为自己感到惭愧。”

“上天保佑你！”女人说着，放声大哭。

“好了，好了，打起精神，亲爱的，我会很快把你们送到那儿；来，让我扶你上车吧。”

杰里去开门时，两个男人——帽子和纽扣孔都标上了颜色——跑过来叫道：“马车！”

“有人订了。”杰里叫道。但是，其中一个男人从那个女人的身边挤过来，跳进马车，另一个人也跟着跳了进去。看上去杰里像警察一样严厉。“这辆马车已经被那位女士预订了，先生们。”

“女士！”其中一个人说，“噢！她可以等。我们的事儿非常重要，再说我们先坐进来，这是我们的权利，我们就待在里面。”

杰里关上车门，脸上掠过一丝滑稽的微笑。“好吧，先生们，请待在里面吧，想待多久就待多久。你们自己休息吧，我可以等。”说完，他对他们置之不理，走到年轻女人的跟前，她站在我的身边。“他们很快就会走的。”他笑道，“别烦恼，亲爱的。”

他们很快就走了，他们明白杰里的搪塞意图之后，就下了车，对他骂着各种难听的话，大声叫喊着他的车牌号，还说要让法院传唤他。这个小小的停顿之后，我们很快走在了去医院的路上，尽可能走背街小巷。杰里按响了大门铃，帮年轻女人下了马车。

“万分感谢。”她说，“我一个人绝不可能赶到这儿。”

“不用客气，我希望这个可爱的孩子会很快好转。”

他在门口望着她进去，轻轻地对自己说道：“你已经对一个最卑微的人那样做了。”随后，他拍了拍我的脖子。有什么事儿让他高兴时，他总是这样做。

当时，雨下得很紧。我们正要离开医院，门又打开了，门房大声叫道：“马车！”我们停了下来，一位女士走下台阶。杰里好像立刻认出了她。她向后移了移面纱，说道：“巴克！杰里迈亚·巴克，是你吗？很高兴在这儿遇到你。你正是我想要的朋友，因为今天在伦敦这一带租车很难。”

“为你服务，非常荣幸，夫人。我很高兴正巧在这儿。我送你去哪儿，夫人？”

“去帕丁顿车站，然后，如果我们来得及的话，我想我们来得及，你就把玛丽和孩子们的情况都告诉我吧。”

我们及时赶到了车站，那位女士站在候车棚下面，跟杰里聊了好一会儿。我发现她原来是波莉的女主人，打听了好多之后，她说：“你怎么觉得冬天拉车这活儿适合你呢？我知道玛丽去年很为你担忧。”

“是的，夫人，她是很担忧，我当时严重咳嗽，一直咳嗽到天气转暖。现在我在外面待得晚了，她的确非常担忧。夫人，你明白，这需要时时刻刻风雨无阻，的确考验一个男人的体质。但是，现在我过得相当不错，如果我没有马儿要照顾，就会感到空落落的。我从小就干这事儿，恐怕也干不好任何其他事儿。”

“好了，巴克，”她说，“如果你当真要拿自己的健康冒险干这工作，那将会非常遗憾，不仅仅是为你自己，也是为玛丽和孩子们。有好多地方需要好车夫或好马夫，如果你认为自己应该放弃拉出租马车这活儿，就告诉我。”

随后，她要巴克代她问玛丽好，并在他的手里放了一些什么，说道：“给两个孩子各五先令，玛丽会知道怎么花。”

杰里对她表示感谢，一副非常高兴的样子。我们走出车站，终于回到了家。不管怎样，我累了。





第四十四章　老上尉和接班人


我和上尉成了好朋友。他是一位出身高贵的老伙计，也是很好的伙伴。我从来没有想过他会不得不离开家，走下坡路，但还是轮到了他，事情就是这样。我当时不在场，不过，我后来听说了所有的一切。

他和杰里把一伙人送过伦敦桥，送到大火车站，正要回来。他们行至大桥和纪念碑之间的某个地方，杰里看到两匹身强力壮的马正拉着酿酒商的一辆空货车。车夫用皮鞭重重地抽打他的马。车很轻，马开始狂飙起来，那个人对马儿失去了控制。当时街上车水马龙，一个年轻女孩被撞倒，马车碾了过去，接下来他们朝杰里的马车撞过来，杰里的马车被掀翻在地，两个轮子都被撞掉了。上尉被拖倒在地，车辕裂成了碎片，其中一个碎片扎进了他的肋部。杰里也被摔倒在地，只是受了点儿擦伤。谁也说不清上尉是怎么脱离危险的，他总是说这是一个奇迹。人们扶起可怜的上尉时，才发现他遭到了碰撞，身负重伤。杰里慢慢地把他牵回了家，鲜血从他的肋部和肩膀滴下来，浸透了雪白的皮毛，真是一幅凄惨景象。原来那个酿酒商驾车时已喝得酩酊大醉，他因此受到了处罚，不得不赔偿了我们主人的损失。但是，没有一个人赔偿可怜的上尉的损失。

马医和杰里竭尽所能缓解他的痛苦，让他舒适。马车不得不修理，所以我好几天都没有出去，杰里没有赚一分钱。事后，我们第一次来到车站时，老板格兰特过来听听上尉的情况。

“他永远也恢复不过来了，”杰里说，“至少干不成我这活儿了，马医今天早上这样说。他说这马儿可以干驮运东西这类活儿。这让我非常生气。驮运，真的！我见过伦敦附近干这活儿的那些马的惨景。我唯一的希望就是所有的酒鬼都能被关进疯人院，而不是允许他们冲撞清醒的人。如果他们摔断自己的骨头，撞碎自己的马车，弄残自己的马，那就是他们自己的事儿，我们不会管，而在我看来，总是无辜者受苦。然后，他们谈什么赔偿！你不可能赔偿。除了失去了一匹像老朋友一样的好马之外，还有种种问题、烦恼和时间损失——说什么补偿，那都是无稽之谈！如果我要在无底深渊里再看到有一个什么魔鬼的话，那就是酒鬼。”

“我说，杰里，”老板说，“你可说到了我的痛处了，你知道，我没有你这样好，这对我来说更丢人。我真希望我能戒酒。”

“那么，”杰里说，“你为什么不戒酒，老板？你这么好的一个人，不应该成为这种东西的奴隶。”

“杰里，我是一个大傻瓜，我试过一次，戒了两天，但是我想我会死的。你是怎么做的？”

“为了戒酒，我也努力了好几周，你明白我从来没有真正醉过，但是我发现我不能主宰自己，酒瘾上来时，真难拒绝。我明白，我们其中一个必须服输——酒鬼或杰里·巴克，我说不应该是杰里·巴克，上帝在帮我。然而，这是一种挣扎，我需要尽可能得到所有帮助，因为直到我设法戒酒时才知道这习惯是多么根深蒂固。不过，波莉煞费苦心，我才会有好食物，而当酒瘾上来时，我常常喝咖啡或吃些薄荷，要么看点儿书，这对我是一种帮助。我不得不一遍遍地对自己说：‘戒酒，否则你就会失去灵魂！戒酒，否则你会伤波莉的心！’感谢上帝，感谢我的爱妻，我挣脱了枷锁，现在我已经十年没有沾过一滴酒了，也从来没有想过。”

“我有很大决心去试，”格兰特说，“因为不能主宰自己的人非常可怜。”

“做吧，老板，做吧，你绝不会后悔，如果我们车队里的一些可怜家伙看到你也可以不喝酒，那将会对他们有多大帮助啊！我知道，如果可能的话，有两三个人就会不想去酒馆。”

起初，上尉好像做得不错，但他是一匹老态龙钟的马儿，拉这么久的出租车仅仅是缘于他极好的体质和杰里的照顾，现在他完全垮了。马医说，如果他能够康复的话，足可以卖几英镑。但是，杰里说，不！把一个可靠的老仆人卖掉，让他辛劳、痛苦，得到的几英镑会腐蚀他所有剩下的钱。杰里认为，他对这个老伙计能做的最仁慈的事儿，就是将一颗子弹坚定地射进他的脑袋，这样他就再也不受罪了，因为他不知道到哪儿去找一个善良的主人让他度过最后的日子。

作出这个决定后的第二天，哈里把我牵到铁匠铺做了几个新脚掌，等我回来时，上尉已经去了。我和家人都难过极了。

现在，杰里不得不物色另一匹马，很快他就从一个在贵族马厩当马夫副手的人那儿得知了一匹马的信息。他是一匹年轻、珍贵的马儿，但是，他曾经逃跑，撞上了另一辆马车，把主人摔了出去，自己也被划伤了，还败坏了自己的名声，不适合再待在一位绅士的马厩里了。马夫正奉命四处打听，尽可能把他卖个好人家。

杰里说：“只要一匹马不凶恶，不难驾驭，我就有很高的兴致。”

“他没有一点儿恶习，”那个人说，“他的嘴也很嫩，我自己认为这也是事故发生的原因。你看他刚被剪过毛，天气糟糕，他也没有得到足够的训练，所以他一出去，就像气球一样充满弹性。我们的老板——我是说我们的马夫——给他上马具时尽可能拉得很紧，还要加上颌缰、勒马缰绳和一个尖尖的马勒，而且那些缰绳是套在底杆上的。我相信，就是这把这匹嘴嫩、浑身是劲的马逼疯的。”

“很有可能。我会来看他的。”杰里说。

第二天，“急性子”——这就是他的名字——来到了家里，他是一匹棕色骏马，才五岁，身上没有一根白毛，像上尉一样高，脑袋非常好看。我非常友好地跟他打招呼，但是没有问他任何问题。第一天夜里，他非常不安，没有躺下，而是不停地绕着圈子猛拽缰绳，用脑袋撞马槽，吵得我难以入睡。然而，第二天，他拉了五六个小时车后，进来时安安静静、规规矩矩。杰里拍着他，跟他说了好多话，他们很快就相互了解了。杰里说，只要配上舒服的嚼子、派上好多活儿，他就会温顺得像羊羔一样。使人人都遭殃的风才是恶风，因为如果他的贵族主人丢失了一百基尼的最爱，车夫却倾其所有地从中得到了一匹好马。

急性子觉得拉车大大掉价，而且讨厌站在那儿排队。但是，一周过完时，他向我承认说，嘴巴舒适、脑袋自由是极大的补偿，毕竟，这活儿不比把脑袋和尾巴一起拴在马鞍上那样掉价。事实上，他过得不错，杰里也非常喜欢他。





第四十五章　杰里的新年


对一些人来说，圣诞节和新年都是非常快乐的时光。但是，对车夫和他们的马来说，尽管那是旺季，但那绝不是什么节日。有那么多宴会、舞会，还有好多娱乐场所开张，所以他们工作辛苦，经常干到很晚。有时，车夫和马不得不在雨天或严寒中等好几个小时，冻得浑身哆嗦，而里面的人却在随着音乐翩翩起舞。我不知道那些美丽的女士是否想过在驾驶座上等候的疲惫车夫，是否想过那匹一直忍耐着站在那儿，冻得腿都僵硬的马儿。

我现在大多在晚上干活，因为我完全习惯了久站，杰里也更担心急性子感冒。圣诞那一周，我们拉了好多夜活儿。杰里咳嗽得厉害，无论我们干到多晚，波莉都会坐在那儿等他，提着灯笼出来迎接他，一副焦虑不安的样子。

新年之夜，我们不得不把两位先生送到伦敦西区广场的一座房子。九点钟，我们把他们送到，奉命十一点再来接他们。“但是，”有个人说，“因为这是一个牌局，所以你们可能得等几分钟，可不要迟到啊。”

十一点的钟声敲响时，我们站在了门口，因为杰里一向准时。时钟十五分钟报一次时——一刻钟、两刻钟、三刻钟，然后十二点的钟声敲响了，门却还没有开。

风变化不定，白天狂风暴雨，而现在却下起了刺骨猛烈的雨夹雪，好像从四面八方袭来。天气很冷，我们没有任何遮挡。杰里下了车，过来把我的一块布往脖子上拉了一点儿，随后，他来回转了一两圈，跺着脚，接下来，他开始敲打自己的胳膊，但是这样却使他咳嗽了起来。于是，他打开车门，坐在底板上，两只脚放在人行道上，总算有了一点儿遮挡。时钟还是每隔十五分钟鸣响一次，却没有人来。十二点半时，他按了门铃，问仆人那天夜里还要不要他的车。

“噢！要，肯定要你的车，”那个人说，“你不能走，很快就结束了。”杰里又坐下来，他的声音非常嘶哑，我几乎听不见。

一点十五分，门开了，两位先生走了出来。他们一句话没说就坐上了车，告诉杰里往哪儿走，差不多有两英里。我的腿都冻木了，我还以为自己会摔跤的。这两个人下车时，没有对让我们久等表示道歉，而是对杰里的收费生气。不过，杰里从来不向别人多收费，也绝不少收，所以他们必须得支付让我们等那两个小时十五分钟的等时费，那对杰里来说可是辛苦钱。

我们终于回到了家。他简直说不出话来，咳嗽得特别厉害。波莉没有问任何问题，而是打开门，为他举着灯笼。

“我不能做点儿什么吗？”她说。

“能，给杰克弄点暖和的东西，然后给我煮些粥。”

这是他声音嘶哑低声说出来的，他几乎都喘不过气来了。而他还是照常给我擦身子，甚至还去干草棚多抱了一捆稻草让我睡觉。波莉给我端来了暖呼呼的饲料，让我感到很舒服，然后他们就锁上了门。

第二天早上，很晚才有人来，当时只有哈里。他给我们刷身子，喂我们吃的，清扫畜栏，然后又把稻草放了回去，就像是礼拜天一样。他一声不吭，既不吹口哨，也不唱歌。中午时分，他又来了，喂我们吃喝。这次是波莉跟他一起来的，她在痛哭，我可以从他们的对话中推测出杰里病情严重，医生说他的病非常严重。就这样，过了两天，家里麻烦重重。我们只看到哈里，有时会见到多莉。我想，她是来陪伴哈里的，因为波莉总是陪着杰里，而杰里必须静养。

第三天，哈里在马厩里时，外面传来了敲门声，格兰特老板走了进来。

“孩子，我不想进屋，”他说，“但是，我想知道你的父亲怎么样了。”

“他很糟，”哈里说，“糟得不能再糟了。他们称这病是‘支气管炎’，医生认为今晚是好转与否的一个坎儿。”

“真不幸，太不幸了，”格兰特摇了摇头说，“我知道上周就有两个人死于这种病。这个病会立马夺命。但是，哪儿有生命，哪儿就有希望，所以你必须振作精神。”

“是的，”哈里马上说道，“医生说，我的父亲比大多数人运气好，因为他不曾饮酒。医生说昨天他发那么高的烧，如果曾喝过酒的话，他就会像一张纸一样被烧掉。但是，我相信他一定会挺过去的。你不觉得他会挺过去吗，格兰特先生？”

老板一脸迷惑。

“如果有任何‘吉人天相’的说法，我相信他一定会的，我的孩子。他是我认识的最好的人。明天一早我再来看看。”

第二天一早，他就来了。

“怎么样？”他说。

“父亲好些了，”哈里说，“妈妈希望他会挺过去。”

“感谢上帝！”老板说，“现在你们必须为他保暖，让他心情轻松，这会使我想起那些马。你看这一周杰克待在暖烘烘的马厩里反而更好，你可以轻松地带他到街上来回走走、伸伸腿。但是，这匹小马，如果他不干活的话，很快就会完蛋的，可以说，会有你受的，当他真要出去干活时，就会出事。”

“现在就是这样，”哈里说，“我已经给他减少谷物了，但他还是精神抖擞，我不知道该怎么对付他。”

“正是这样，”格兰特说，“听着，告诉你的妈妈，看她是否同意我每天来看他，直到一切安顿好为止，然后让他拉一段时间车，无论他赚多少，我都会给你的妈妈一半，这样可以贴补马饲料的费用。我知道你的爸爸参加了一个出色的俱乐部，而俱乐部不会养马，这段时间马儿会无所事事。我中午会来，到时候听听你的妈妈怎么说。”还没等哈里感谢，他就走了。

中午，我想他去见了波莉，因为他和哈里一起走进马厩，给急性子戴上马具，把他牵了出去。

他来看过急性子有一周多时间。当哈里感谢他或说起他的恩情时，他一笑置之，说那都是他的运气好，因为他的马正需要休息一小段时间，否则他们还休息不了呢。

尽管杰里持续好转，但是医生说如果他想活到老年，就绝不能再干拉车的活儿了。孩子们一起商量过多次爸爸妈妈将来做什么，他们可以怎么帮忙赚钱。

一天下午，急性子被牵了进来，浑身又湿又脏。

“街上净是烂泥，”老板说，“我的孩子，让他清洁干爽一下，这会让你暖和起来的。”

“好的，老板，”哈里说，“我会让他清洁干爽的。你知道我受过父亲的训练。”

“我希望所有的男孩子都像你一样受过训练。”老板说。

当哈里正用海绵擦去急性子身上和腿上的泥浆时，多莉走了进来，看上去心事重重。

“谁住在菲尔斯托，哈里？妈妈收到了一封菲尔斯托的来信，她好像非常高兴，拿着跑上楼给父亲看。”

“你不知道？啊，那是福勒夫人住地的名字——是妈妈以前的女主人，你知道——就是爸爸去年夏天遇见的那位女士，她还分别给了你和我五先令。”

“噢！是福勒夫人。我当然知道她所有的一切。我想知道她给妈妈写的是什么。”

“妈妈上周给她写了信，”哈里说，“你知道她对爸爸说过，如果他不想再拉车，就要告诉她。我不知道她说了什么。跑去看看，多莉。”

哈里像老马夫那样唰唰唰地擦洗着急性子！几分钟后，多莉就蹦跳着走进了马厩。

“噢！哈里，这可是再美不过的事儿了。福勒夫人说我们都可以去跟她做邻居。她有一套农舍空着，正适合我们住，有花园，有鸡舍，有苹果树，应有尽有！她的马车夫春天就要走了，到时候她想要爸爸接替他。周围都是好人家，你可以在他们的花园或马厩里找个活儿，要么当个小听差。那儿也有适合我的好学校。妈妈一会儿哭一会儿笑，爸爸看上去也很高兴！”

“这真是少有的高兴事儿，”哈里说，“我应该说这正合适，这对爸爸妈妈都合适。但是，我不想穿着双排扣紧身衣当小听差。我要当马夫或园丁。”

杰里身体一好，他们就马上决定搬到乡下，马车和马要尽快卖掉。

对我来说，这是一个不幸的消息，因为我现在不再年轻了，也不能指望自己的状况有任何改善。自从离开伯特维克庄园以来，我跟亲爱的主人杰里在一起再开心不过了。但是，拉了三年出租车，即使条件再好，也会筋疲力尽。我觉得自己不再是以前的那匹马了。

格兰特马上说他想要急性子，车站上会有人买我，但是，杰里说我不应该再跟什么人去拉马车，格兰特答应为我找一个舒适的地方。

离别的日子到了。杰里还不能出门，新年之夜过后，我就从来没有见过他。波莉和孩子们来向我告别。“可怜的老杰克！亲爱的老杰克！我真希望我们能带你一起走。”说着，她把一只手放在我的鬃毛上，脸贴近我的脖子，亲了亲我。多莉呜呜哭着也亲了亲我。哈里抚摸了我好一阵子，一言不发，看上去非常伤心。就这样我被带去了新的地方。





第四部





第四十六章　杰克斯和女士


我被卖给了一个粮食贩子兼面包师，杰里认识他。杰里觉得我跟他在一起应该吃得好，活儿也公道。最初他说的完全没错，如果我的主人总是在家里的话，我想我不会超负荷工作，但是有一个工头对每匹马都总是催赶，常常在我装满货物时还下令再装点儿别的东西。我的车夫名叫杰克斯，他经常说我不应该拉那么多，而那个工头却总是压制他：“一次能干完的事儿，就不用分两次去干。他就喜欢往前赶。”

杰克斯像其他车夫一样总是拉起马缰，这样我就无法拉得轻松了。到那儿三四个月后，我发现干活会让我筋疲力尽。

一天，我拉的东西比往常更多，部分路段是陡坡。我用尽全力，却还是上不去，不得不走走停停。这让我的车夫感到不快，他狠狠地抽了一鞭。“快走，你这懒家伙，”他说，“否则我就收拾你。”

我又开始拉起了重负，又向前挣扎了几码远，鞭子又抽了下来，我又向前挣扎。大车的鞭子抽在身上火辣辣的疼，我的心像可怜的肋部一样疼痛难忍。我竭尽全力，还是受到这样的惩罚和虐待，这真让我伤心啊。他要第三次残忍地鞭打我，这时一位女士快步走到他的身边，用甜美、诚恳的声音说道：

“噢！请不要再打你这匹好马了，我相信他是全力以赴，这条路很陡，我相信他是竭尽全力了。”

“如果他竭尽全力还不能把这货物拉上去，那他就必须尽更大的努力，夫人，我就知道这些。”杰克斯说。

“可这不是重负吗？”她说。

“是的，是的，太重了，”他说，“可那不是我的过错。我们正要出发时，工头过来了，他为了省事，多装了三英担，所以我必须尽可能继续做好。”

他又要举起鞭子，这时那位女士说道：

“请住手！我想，如果你愿意的话，我可以帮你。”

那个人放声大笑。

“你明白，”她说，“你并没有给他一个公平的机会。他被马缰牵制着脑袋，用不上全力，如果你取掉马缰，我相信他就会做得更好——请试试吧。”她循循善诱地说，“如果你愿意试试，我会非常开心的。”

“好，好，”杰克斯短促地笑了一下说，“能让一位女士开心，当然做什么都行。你想把缰绳放下多长，夫人？”

“完全放下，把他的头完全放开。”

缰绳取掉后，我立刻把脑袋低到了膝盖的位置。这真舒服啊！随后，我上下摇晃了好几次，想摆脱脖子的疼痛僵硬感。

“可怜的家伙！你要的就是这个。”她一边用温柔的手轻轻拍我和抚摸我，一边说道，“现在，如果你能对他和声细语，领他向前，我相信他就能做得更好。”

杰克斯牵住了缰绳：“快点儿，小黑。”我低下头，把我全身的重量都压在了马轭上，我不遗余力。货车继续前进，我稳健地把它拉上了坡，然后停下来歇了口气。

那位女士顺着人行道向前走，此刻穿过去，走到了大路上。她抚摸和轻拍我的脖子，我已经很久没有被人拍过了。

“你明白，你给他机会，他就会心甘情愿。我相信他是一匹脾气不错的马，而且我敢说他以前有过较好的日子。你不要再给他上缰绳了，好吗？”因为他正要按照老方法套上缰绳。

“好吧，夫人，我无法否认，是放开他的脑袋助他爬上了坡，下次我会记住的，谢谢你，夫人。但是，如果他不戴导向马缰出去，我就会成为所有车夫的笑柄，你明白，这是时尚。”

她说：“不跟随坏时尚，而是引导好风尚，不是更好吗？现在，好多先生都不用导向马缰了。我们的拉车马已经十五年没有戴过了，干起活来要比那些戴导向马缰的马轻松好多。此外，”她非常认真地补充说，“如果我们没有很好的理由，就无权摧残上帝创造的任何生灵。我们称他们是不会说话的动物，他们就是这样，因为他们不能把自己的感受告诉我们，但是他们并没有因不会说话而减少痛苦。不过，我现在不能耽误你了。谢谢你在这匹好马身上试用了我的方法，我相信你会发现这远比鞭子要好。再见。”说完，她又轻轻地拍了拍我，脚步轻快地穿过了小路，我再也没有见到过她。

“那是一位真正的女士，我敢肯定，”杰克斯自言自语说，“她说话彬彬有礼，就像我是绅士一样。无论如何，我要上坡时会尝试她的方法。”我必须为他说一句公道话，他让我的缰绳后退了好几个孔眼，之后要上坡的话，也总是让我的头活动自如。不过，负重还在继续。尽管吃得好、休息得好可以让你工作时有体力，但是没有一匹马受得了超载。我很快就因为这个彻底垮了，主人买了一匹比较年轻的马接替我。我不妨在这儿提一下这段时间另一个让我受苦的原因。尽管我听同伴们说起过，但是从来没有亲历过这种不幸：这是一个光线糟糕的马厩，后面只有一扇很小的窗户，结果畜栏几乎都是黑黢黢的。

除了让我精神压抑之外，这也大大地损害了我的视力，当我突然从黑暗中被牵到耀眼的阳光下时，我的眼睛生疼生疼的。好几次我都绊在了门槛上，几乎看不清自己要去哪儿。

我相信，如果在那儿待很久的话，我早就变得半盲了。那将会是极大的不幸，因为我听人说过赶一匹全瞎的马要比赶一匹视力不佳的马安全，因为视力不佳常常会使他们变得非常胆怯。然而，我躲过了一劫，视力上没有受到持久的伤害。我被卖给了一个大马车主。





第四十七章　艰难岁月


我永远忘不了自己的新主人，他有一双黑眼睛、一只鹰钩鼻、一口像斗牛犬那样的牙齿，他的声音就像车轮碾过砾石发出的摩擦声一样刺耳。他名叫尼古拉斯·斯金纳，我相信他就是可怜的“破衣萨姆”的车老板。

我听人说过眼见为实，而我应该说是身受为实，因为尽管我以前见过好多，但是直到现在，我才知道出租车役马的生活是多么悲惨。

斯金纳有一批低级马车和一批低级车夫，他对那些人非常苛刻，那些人对马也非常苛刻。在这个地方，我们没有礼拜天可以休息，当时正是酷热的夏天。

礼拜天早上，有时会有一群放荡不羁的人租一天马车，四个人坐在里面，另一个人和车夫坐在一起，我必须得把他们送到十几英里外的乡下，然后再返回来。无论上坡路多么陡峭，无论天气多么炎热，他们没有人会下车走上坡去——除非车夫担心我实在应付不了。有时我非常燥热和疲惫，简直连饭都不想碰。我是多么想念以前热天杰里星期六夜里给我们的加了硝石的美味的糠糊糊啊，那常常会让我们凉快下来，浑身舒服。随后，我们有两个晚上和一个白天的连续休息，星期一早上我们就像返老还童似的精神抖擞。但是，这儿没有休息，我的车夫和他的主人一样冷酷无情。他有一根无情的鞭子，鞭梢上有一个东西非常锋利，有时会把我抽出血来，他甚至会抽打我的肚子，还会劈头盖脸地打我。这样的侮辱让我伤心极了，我却仍然竭尽全力，从不退却，因为正如可怜的姜姐所说：无济于事，人最强大。

我的生活现在是绝对的不幸，我真希望自己能像姜姐一样在干活时倒地身亡，脱离苦海。有一天，我这个愿望差点儿变成现实。

早上八点，我到出租车站。我拉了好几趟乘客，然后要送一个乘客去火车站。一列长长的火车就要开进来了，所以我的车夫停在站外的马车后面，想碰碰运气，在返程路上捎个客人。那是一辆满载乘客的火车，所有的马车很快就都有人坐了，而我们的车也受到了召唤。那是一行四人：一个大声嚷嚷、咋咋呼呼的男人带着一位女士、一个小男孩和一个年轻姑娘，还有一大堆行李。女士和小男孩坐进了马车，当男人吩咐抬行李时，年轻姑娘走过来看着我。

“爸爸，”她说，“我肯定这匹可怜的马儿拉我们和所有行李跑不了那么远，他有气无力、疲惫不堪。请看看他！”

“噢！小姐，他没事儿，”我的车夫说，“他够壮的。”

那个搬运一些重箱子的搬运工向那位先生建议，行李这么多，他要不要再叫一辆车。

“你的马能不能拉？”那个咋咋呼呼的男人问道。

“噢！他能做好。把箱子搬上来吧，搬运工，再多些他也能拉。”他帮着拖上来一只沉甸甸的箱子，我感觉到弹簧都压了下去。

“爸爸，爸爸，请再叫一辆车吧，”年轻姑娘用恳求的语气说道，“我相信我们错了，我相信这很残忍。”

“胡说，格蕾丝，马上进去，不要这样大惊小怪。如果生意人雇车之前都要检查一下拉出租车的马，那就太糟了——那个人肯定懂行。得了，进来吧，住嘴！”

我的友善的朋友只好服从，箱子一个接一个地被拖上来，放在车顶或车夫身边。最后一切就绪，他像往常一样猛拉缰绳，挥鞭驶出了车站。

车子很沉，从早上起，我既没有吃过东西，也没有休息过，但我还是不顾残酷和不公，像往常一样竭尽全力。

我一路走得还算顺利，直至我们来到路德门山。然而，车子太沉了，我自己也筋疲力尽了。我在缰绳和皮鞭的不断驱赶下挣扎前进，霎时间——我说不清是怎么回事——我的蹄子在身下一滑，我重重地侧翻在地，我摔得猛，摔得狠，仿佛把我所有的气息都摔了出去。我躺在那儿，一动不动，事实上，我无力动弹，我想我现在要死了。我听到自己周围一片混乱，有响亮愤怒的声音，有卸行李的声音，但是这都像做梦一样。我想我听到了那个甜美、怜悯的声音说：“噢！那匹可怜的马儿！这都是我们的过错。”有人走过来，解开我笼头上的喉带，松开紧绑马轭的挽绳。有人说：“他死了，他再也起不来了。”随后，我听到一个警察在下令，但是我睁不开眼睛，只能偶尔喘口气。一些冷水浇在了我的头上，一些兴奋剂灌进了我的嘴里，一些东西盖在了我的身上。我说不清在那儿躺了多久，不过，我发现自己又起死回生了。一个声音和蔼的男人拍着我，鼓励我站起来。他又灌了我一些兴奋剂，我努力了一两次之后，终于摇摇晃晃地站了起来，然后被轻轻地牵到了附近的马厩。到了这儿，我被安排进了一个铺好干草的畜栏里，有人给我送来了热粥，我感激地喝了。

晚上，我恢复到了足以被牵回斯金纳的马厩的程度，我想他们为我尽力了。第二天早上，斯金纳带着马医来看我。他非常仔细地给我检查了一遍，说道：

“这是过劳症，而不是患病。如果你能让他放养六个月，他就还能再干活，但是，现在他身上连一点儿力气也没有了。”

“那他肯定就完了，”斯金纳说，“我没有什么牧场来养病马——他可能好转，也可能好转不了，我的生意容不下那种事儿。我的办法是，只要他们能走，就让他们干活，最后把他们卖给屠宰场或别的地方换钱。”

“如果他患气喘，”马医说，“你最好立即把他杀了，但他现在不是。再过十来天有一个马匹拍卖会，如果你让他休息，给他吃的，他就可以恢复精神，至少你可以拿到比他的皮囊高的价钱。”

听了这个建议，我想斯金纳有些不情愿地下令，要给我好吃的，好好照顾我。让我高兴的是，那个马夫执行命令比主人下令要心甘情愿得多。十天的彻底休息，大量好吃的燕麦、干草和里面拌有煮熟的亚麻籽的糠糊糊，比其他任何东西都更能让我恢复状态，那些亚麻籽糠糊糊香喷喷的，我开始想，毕竟，活着要比死了好。事发后的第十二天，我被牵到了离伦敦城几英里的拍卖会上。我觉得，对我目前处境的任何改变都一定会是好转，所以我抬起头来，希望有最好的结果。





第四十八章　大好人农场主和孙子威利


在这次拍卖会上，我发现自己当然是跟那些衰老的马在一起——有的瘸了，有的得了气喘，有的老了，有的我想开枪打死会更受其欢迎。

买家，还有卖家，他们中的好多人看上去境况并不比他们正在为其讨价还价的可怜牲口好多少。都是一些贫穷的老男人，他们想花几英镑买一匹马或马驹来帮他们拉一些小木头或煤车。有些贫穷的男人想把一匹衰老的马卖两三个英镑，这比把他打死损失要小。看上去有些人好像已经完全让贫困和艰难岁月变得铁石心肠。不过，还有些人我愿意用尽最后的力气去效劳，尽管他们贫困，衣衫褴褛，但是他们友好、人道，他们的声音让我信任。其中有一位走路摇摇晃晃的老人，他非常喜欢我，我也非常喜欢他，但是我不够强壮——那是焦虑一刻啊！我注意到从集市好马区走过来一个男人，看上去这个人像是绅士模样的农场主，身边带着一个小男孩，他后背宽阔，肩膀浑圆，脸庞和蔼红润，头戴一顶宽边帽。他来到我和同伴们的身边时，站在那儿一动不动，用同情的目光来回打量着我们。我看到他的目光落在我的身上，我还有不错的鬃毛和尾巴，这为我的外貌增添了光彩。我竖起耳朵，看着他。

“威利，这儿有一匹马，他有过比较美好的日子。”

“可怜的老家伙！”男孩子说，“爷爷，你觉得他拉过马车吗？”

“噢，是的！我的孩子，”农场主又凑近了些说，“他年轻时可能挺不错。看他的鼻孔和耳朵，看他脖子和肩膀的形状。这匹马饲养得不错。”他伸出一只手，在我的脖子上亲切地拍了一下，我伸出鼻子，对他的善意作出回应，男孩子抚摸着我的脸。

“可怜的老家伙！看到了吧，爷爷，他是多么善解人意！你能不能买下他，就像你对瓢虫那样让他重新焕发青春呢？”

“亲爱的孩子，我不可能让所有的老马都变年轻，再说，瓢虫并不是很老，她是因为身体虚弱，受到了虐待。”

“好吧，爷爷，我不相信这匹马老了，看看他的鬃毛和尾巴。我希望你看看他的嘴巴，然后你就清楚了，尽管他也很瘦，但是他的眼睛并不像一些老马那样凹陷。”

老先生朗声大笑：“上帝保佑这个孩子！他像他的老爷爷一样熟悉马儿。”

“爷爷，请看看他的嘴巴，然后问问价钱，我相信他在我们的牧场上会变年轻的。”

这时，那个把我带来卖的人插话了。

“小先生真懂行。先生，事实上，这匹马只是因为拉车过度被累垮了，他并不老。我听马医说，他的呼吸系统没有损坏，只要放养六个月，他就会恢复精神。过去这十天，我都照顾他，从来没有碰到过像他这样感恩可人的动物，肯定值得一位先生为他付五英镑，让他有一个机会。我保证明年春天他会值二十英镑。”

老人笑出了声，小男孩子急切地抬起头来。

“噢，爷爷，你刚才不是说那匹小公马卖五英镑超出了你的预期吗？如果你真的买下这匹马，你也不会更穷的。”

农场主慢慢地摸着我的腿，我的腿肿胀疲劳，随后，他看了看我的嘴巴：“大概有十三四岁了吧，请让他小跑一下，好吗？”

我弓起可怜的瘦脖子，微微抬起尾巴，尽可能甩出腿，因为它们非常僵硬。

“你为他要的最低价是多少？”我回来后，农场主问。

“五英镑，先生，那是我们主人定的最低价。”

“这是一个投机买卖，”老先生摇摇头说，而与此同时又慢慢地掏出钱包；“完全是投机买卖！你这儿还有别的生意吗？”他一边说，一边数着金币，放进那个人的手里。

“没有，先生。如果你乐意，我可以把马给你牵到客栈。”

“那就牵吧，我现在正准备去那儿。”

他们向前走，我被牵在后面。男孩子抑制不住喜悦之情，老先生好像也很高兴。我在客栈好好吃了一顿，随后就被新主人的一个仆人轻轻地骑回了家。我们走进一个大牧场，其中一个角落有一个棚。

大好人先生就是我恩人的名字，他吩咐我每天早晚都要有干草和燕麦，白天让我在牧场跑跑。“你，威利，”他说，“必须小心照顾他，我把他交给你看管。”

男孩子对这个职责非常自豪，一丝不苟地承担下来。他没有一天不过来看我，有时会把我从别的马中间挑出来，给我一点儿胡萝卜或好吃的东西，要么就在我吃燕麦时站在我身边。他总是带着亲切的话语和爱抚而来，所以我当然渐渐地喜欢上了他。他叫我老朋友，只要他在田地里，我总是来到他的身边，跟着他四处跑。有时他叫来他的爷爷，他的爷爷总是仔细查看我的腿。

“威利，这是我们要注意的一点，”他会说，“而他正在持续好转，我想明年春天我们会看到好转。”

极好的休息、好吃的食物、柔软的草皮和温和的运动，很快就开始对我的健康状况和精神产生了影响。我从母亲那儿继承了良好的体质，小时候从来没有扭伤过，所以我比其他好多干过活的马更有机会养足力气。冬天里，我的腿大大好转，我开始感觉自己又一次完全年轻了。春天来临，三月的一天，大好人先生决定让我试拉一下四轮敞篷轻便马车。我非常高兴，他和威利驾着我走了几英里。我的腿现在不再僵硬了，我干起活来轻松自如。

“威利，他变年轻了，我们现在必须让他干点儿轻活儿，到仲夏时，他就会像瓢虫一样了。他的嘴巴漂亮，步速也不错，好得不能再好了。”

“噢，爷爷，我真高兴你买了他！”

“我也很高兴，我的孩子，不过，他更要感谢你，而不是我。我们现在必须为他物色一个安静优雅、受到重视的地方。”





第四十九章　最后的家


那年的一个夏日，马夫格外仔细地为我清洗梳刷，我觉得肯定有某种新变化即将到来。他修剪了我的距毛和腿毛，用焦油毛刷刷了刷我的蹄子，甚至分开了我的额毛。我觉得马具也擦得格外亮。威利跟爷爷一起坐上马车时好像喜忧参半。

“只要小姐们喜欢他，”老先生说，“她们将适合他，他也会适合她们。我们只能试试。”

出村一两英里地，我们来到了一所漂亮的矮房前，门前是草坪和灌木丛，一条车道通到门口。威利按了门铃，问布罗姆菲尔德小姐或埃伦小姐是否在家。是的，她们在家。于是，我和威利待在一起，大好人先生走进了房子。十分钟左右，他就回来了，后面跟着三位小姐：一位个子高挑、脸色苍白、裹着白色披肩的女士，她靠在一位比较年轻、眼睛乌黑、一脸微笑的女士身上，另一位模样非常端庄的女士是布罗姆菲尔德小姐。她们都过来看我，问了一些问题。那个比较年轻的女士——就是埃伦小姐——非常喜欢我，她说她相信会喜欢我，我有一张如此好看的脸庞。那位个子高挑、脸色苍白的小姐说，如果马以前摔倒过，她乘坐这种马拉的车总会紧张，怕我会再次跌倒，如果那样，她永远也克服不了那种恐惧。

“你们明白，小姐们，”大好人先生说，“好多一流马摔破膝盖不是他们自己的过错，而是因为车夫粗心大意，在我看来，应该说这匹马也一样。当然，我不希望影响你。如果你喜欢，你可以试用他一下，然后你的马夫就会对他有判断了。”

“说到马的事儿，你一向是我们的好顾问，”那位端庄的小姐说，“你的推荐对我大有帮助。如果我的姐姐拉维尼娅不反对的话，我们就会同意试用一下，多谢。”

于是，她们就安排让我第二天过去。

第二天早上，一个模样机灵的年轻人过来牵我。起初，他看上去非常高兴，而当看到我的膝盖时，他用一种失望的声音说道：

“先生，我觉得，你不应该把这样一匹受到损伤的马推荐给女士们。”

“‘品德优美才是真美’，”我的主人说，“你就带他试一下，我相信，你会公平对待他，年轻人。如果他不如你以前骑过的马安全，那就把他送回来。”

我被牵到了新家，安置在一个舒适的马厩里，吃过饭后，就独自待着。第二天，马夫给我清洗脸时，说道：

“这就像黑骏马的那颗星星，他也有这么高。我不知道他如今在哪儿。”

又过了一小会儿，他清洗到了我的脖子上流过血、皮肤上留有一个小疙瘩的地方。他简直吃了一惊，一边开始仔细地查看我，一边自言自语。

“额头上有白星，右侧一只白脚，这个小疙瘩就在那个地方。”随后，看着我的后背中央，“哎呀，还有那一小片白毛，约翰以前经常称它是‘黑骏马的三便士银币’。这一定是黑骏马！啊，黑骏马！黑骏马！你还认识我吗？差点儿害死你的小乔·格林？”说完，他开始对我拍来拍去，好像高兴极了。

我不能说我还认得他，因为现在他长成了英俊的小伙子，黑色的络腮胡，男子汉的声音，但是我相信他认识我，他就是乔·格林，我非常高兴。我把鼻子凑到他的近前，想说我们是朋友。我从来没有见过哪个人这么高兴。

“给你一次公正的试用！我想的确应该这样！我不知道是哪个无赖弄伤了你的膝盖，我的老骏马！你一定是在什么地方受过虐待。好了，好了，就是你现在过得不好，也不会是我的过错了。我真希望约翰·曼利也能在这儿看到你。”

下午，我被套进了一辆低矮的游园车，带到了门口。埃伦小姐打算试我，格林跟她一道去。我很快就发现她是一个好把式，好像对我的步速也很满意。我听到乔在对她说我的事儿，他确信我就是戈登先生家以前的那匹黑骏马。

当我们返回时，其他姐妹都出来打听我表现如何。她把她刚才听到的都告诉了她们，然后说道：

“我肯定会给戈登夫人写信告诉她，她最喜欢的马儿已经来到了我们这儿。她会多么高兴啊！”

之后，我每天都拉车，拉了一周左右，因为我看上去非常安全，所以拉维尼娅小姐最后也坐上小马车冒险出行。之后，她们决定留下我并叫我的原名黑骏马。

如今，我已经在这个快乐的地方住了整整一年。乔是最出色、最善良的马夫。我工作轻松愉快，感觉自己所有的力量和精神全都恢复如初了。前几天，大好人先生对乔说道：

“在你这个地方，他会活到二十岁——说不定更久。”

威利总是得空就跟我说话，把我当成是特别亲密的朋友。小姐们已经承诺绝不会把我卖掉，所以我没有什么害怕的。我的故事到这儿就结束了。我的烦恼都结束了，我无拘无束。我经常在早晨完全清醒之前，想象自己还在伯特维克庄园的果园里，跟老朋友们一起站在那些苹果树下。

01　My Early Home


The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house, which stood by the roadside; at the top of the meadow was a plantation of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.

While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk, as I could not eat grass. In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot, we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and when it was cold, we had a nice warm shed near the plantation.

As soon as I was old enough to eat grass, my mother used to go out to work in the daytime, and came back in the evening.

There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field, as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.

One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:

“I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart-horse colts, and, of course, they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and wellborn; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.”

I have never forgotten my mother's advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.

Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate, she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say,“Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?”I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favorites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.

There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted, he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.

One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master, we trotted up nearer to see what went on.

“Bad boy!”he said,“bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last—there—take your money and go home. I shall not want you on my farm again.”So we never saw Dick any more. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.





02　The Hunt


Before I was two years old, a circumstance happened which I have never forgotten. It was early in the spring; there had been a little frost in the night, and a light mist still hung over the plantations and meadows. I and the other colts were feeding at the lower part of the field when we heard, quite in the distance, what sounded like the cry of dogs. The oldest of the colts raised his head, pricked his ears, and said,“There are the hounds!”and immediately cantered off followed by the rest of us to the upper part of the field, where we could look over the hedge and see several fields beyond. My mother and an old riding horse of our master's were also standing near, and seemed to know all about it.

“They have found a hare,”said my mother,“and if they come this way we shall see the hunt.”

And soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next to ours. I never heard such a noise as they made. They did not bark, nor howl, nor whine, but kept on a“yo! yo, o, o! yo! yo, o, o!”at the top of their voices. After them came a number of men on horseback, some of them in green coats, all galloping as fast as they could. The old horse snorted and looked eagerly after them, and we young colts wanted to be galloping with them, but they were soon away into the fields lower down; here it seemed as if they had come to a stand; the dogs left off barking, and ran about every way with their noses to the ground.

“They have lost the scent,”said the old horse;“perhaps the hare will get off.”

“What hare?”I said.

“Oh! I don't know what hare; likely enough it may be one of our own hares out of the plantation; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and men to run after;”and before long the dogs began their“yo! yo, o, o!”again, and back they came altogether at full speed, making straight for our meadow at the part where the high bank and hedge overhang the brook.

“Now we shall see the hare,”said my mother; and just then a hare wild with fright rushed by, and made for the plantation. On came the dogs, they burst over the bank, leaped the stream, and came dashing across the field, followed by the huntsmen. Six or eight men leaped their horses clean over, close upon the dogs. The hare tried to get through the fence; it was too thick, and she turned sharp round to make for the road, but it was too late; the dogs were upon her with their wild cries; we heard one shriek, and that was the end of her. One of the huntsmen rode up and whipped off the dogs, who would soon have torn her to pieces. He held her up by the leg, torn and bleeding, and all the gentlemen seemed well pleased.

As for me, I was so astonished that I did not at first see what was going on by the brook; but when I did look, there was a sad sight; two fine horses were down, one was struggling in the stream, and the other was groaning on the grass. One of the riders was getting out of the water covered with mud, the other lay quite still.

“His neck is broken,”said my mother.

“And serves him right, too,”said one of the colts.

I thought the same, but my mother did not join with us.

“Well! no,”she said,“you must not say that; but though I am an old horse, and have seen and heard a great deal, I never yet could make out why men are so fond of this sport; they often hurt themselves, often spoil good horses, and tear up the fields, and all for a hare or a fox, or a stag, that they could get more easily some other way; but we are only horses, and don't know.”

While my mother was saying this, we stood and looked on. Many of the riders had gone to the young man; but my master, who had been watching what was going on, was the first to raise him. His head fell back and his arms hung down, and everyone looked very serious. There was no noise now; even the dogs were quiet, and seemed to know that something was wrong. They carried him to our master's house. I heard afterward that it was young George Gordon, the Squire's only son, a fine, tall young man, and the pride of his family.

There was now riding off in all directions to the doctor's, to the farrier's, and no doubt to Squire Gordon's, to let him know about his son. When Mr. Bond, the farrier, came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass, he felt him all over, and shook his head; one of his legs was broken. Then some one ran to our master's house and came back with a gun; presently there was a loud bang and a dreadful shriek, and then all was still; the black horse moved no more.

My mother seemed much troubled; she said she had known that horse for years, and that his name was“Rob Roy;”he was a good horse, and there was no vice in him. She never would go to that part of the field afterwards.

Not many days after, we heard the church bell tolling for a long time; and looking over the gate we saw a long, strange black coach that was covered with black cloth and was drawn by black horses; after that came another and another and another, and all were black, while the bell kept tolling, tolling. They were carrying young Gordon to the churchyard to bury him. He would never ride again. What they did with Rob Roy I never knew; but 'twas all for one little hare.





03　My Breaking In


I was now beginning to grow handsome; my coat had grown fine and soft, and was bright black. I had one white foot, and a pretty white star on my forehead. I was thought very handsome; my master would not sell me till I was four years old; he said lads ought not to work like men, and colts ought not to work like horses till they were quite grown up.

When I was four years old, Squire Gordon came to look at me. He examined my eyes, my mouth, and my legs; he felt them all down; and then I had to walk and trot and gallop before him; He seemed to like me, and said,“When he has been well broken in, he will do very well.”My master said he would break me in himself, as he should not like me to be frightened or hurt, and he lost no time about it, for the next day he began.

Everyone may not know what breaking in is, therefore I will describe it. It means to teach a horse to wear a saddle and bridle and to carry on his back a man, woman, or child; to go just the way they wish and to go quietly. Besides this, he has to learn to wear a collar, a crupper, and a breeching, and to stand still while they are put on; then to have a cart or a chaise fixed behind him, so that he cannot walk or trot without dragging it after him: and he must go fast or slow, just as the driver wishes. He must never start at what he sees, nor speak to other horses, nor bite, nor kick, nor have any will of his own; but always do his master's will, even though he may be very tired or hungry; but the worst of all is, when his harness is once on, he may neither jump for joy nor lie down for weariness. So you see this breaking in is a great thing.

I had of course long been used to a halter and a headstall, and to be led about in the field and lanes quietly, but now I was to have a bit and a bridle; my master gave me some oats as usual, and, after a good deal of coaxing, he got the bit into my mouth, and the bridle fixed, but it was a nasty thing! Those who have never had a bit in their mouths, cannot think how bad it feels; a great piece of cold hard steel as thick as a man's finger to be pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth and over one's tongue, with the ends coming out at the corner of your mouth, and held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round your nose, and under your chin; so that in no way in the world can you get rid of the nasty hard thing; it is very bad! yes, very bad! at least I thought so; but I knew my mother always wore one when she went out, and all horses did when they were grown up; and so, what with the nice oats, and what with my master's pats, kind words, and gentle ways, I got to wear my bit and bridle.

Next came the saddle, but that was not half so bad; my master put it on my back very gently, while old Daniel held my head; he then made the girths fast under my body, patting and talking to me all the time; then I had a few oats, then a little leading about, and this he did every day till I began to look for the oats and the saddle. At length, one morning my master got on my back and rode me round the meadow on the soft grass. It certainly did feel queer; but I must say I felt rather proud to carry my master, and as he continued to ride me a little every day, I soon became accustomed to it.

The next unpleasant business was putting on the iron shoes; that too was very hard at first. My master went with me to the smith's forge, to see that I was not hurt or got any fright. The blacksmith took my feet in his hands one after the other, and cut away some of the hoof. It did not pain me, so I stood still on three legs till he had done them all. Then he took a piece of iron the shape of my foot, and clapped it on, and drove some nails through the shoe quite into my hoof, so that the shoe was firmly on. My feet felt very stiff and heavy, but in time I got used to it.

And now having got so far, my master went on to break me to harness; there were more new things to wear. First, a stiff heavy collar just on my neck and a bridle with great side-pieces against my eyes called blinkers, and blinkers indeed they were, for I could not see on either side, but only straight in front of me; next, there was a small saddle with a nasty stiff strap that went right under my tail; that was the crupper: I hated the crupper—to have my long tail doubled up and poked through that strap was almost as bad as the bit. I never felt more like kicking, but of course I could not kick such a good master, and so in time I got used to everything, and could do my work as well as my mother.

I must not forget to mention one part of my training, which I have always considered a very great advantage. My master sent me for a fortnight to a neighboring farmer's, who had a meadow which was skirted on one side by the railway. Here were some sheep and cows, and I was turned in among them.

I shall never forget the first train that ran by. I was feeding quietly near the pales which separated the meadow from the railway, when I heard a strange sound at a distance, and before I knew whence it came—with a rush and a clatter, and a puffing out of smoke—a long black train of something flew by, and was gone almost before I could draw my breath. I turned, and galloped to the further side of the meadow as fast as I could go, and there I stood snorting with astonishment and fear. In the course of the day many other trains went by, some more slowly; these drew up at the station close by, and sometimes made an awful shriek and groan before they stopped. I thought it very dreadful, but the cows went on eating very quietly, and hardly raised their heads as the black frightful thing came puffing and grinding past.

For the first few days I could not feed in peace; but as I found that this terrible creature never came into the field, or did me any harm, I began to disregard it, and very soon I cared as little about the passing of a train as the cows and sheep did.

Since then I have seen many horses much alarmed and restive at the sight or sound of a steam engine; but thanks to my good master's care, I am as fearless at railway stations as in my own stable.

Now if any one wants to break in a young horse well, that is the way.

My master often drove me in double harness with my mother, because she was steady, and could teach me how to go better than a strange horse. She told me the better I behaved, the better I should be treated, and that it was wisest always to do my best to please my master.“But,”said she,“there are a great many kinds of men; there are good, thoughtful men like our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; and there are bad, cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own. Beside, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant and careless, who never trouble themselves to think; these spoil more horses than all, just for want of sense; they don't mean it, but they do it for all that. I hope you will fall into good hands; but a horse never knows who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us; but still I say, do your best, wherever it is, and keep up your good name.”





04　Birtwick Park


At this time I used to stand in the stable, and my coat was brushed every day till it shone like a rook's wing. It was early in May, when there came a man from Squire Gordon's, who took me away to the Hall. My master said,“Good-bye, Darkie; be a good horse, and always do your best.”I could not say“good-bye,”so I put my nose into his hand; he patted me kindly, and I left my first home. As I lived some years with Squire Gordon, I may as well tell something about the place.

Squire Gordon's Park skirted the village of Birtwick. It was entered by a large iron gate, at which stood the first lodge, and then you trotted along on a smooth road between clumps of large old trees; then another lodge and another gate which brought you to the house and the gardens. Beyond this lay the home paddock, the old orchard, and the stables. There was accommodation for many horses and carriages; but I need only describe the stable into which I was taken; this was very roomy, with four good stalls; a large swinging window opened into the yard, which made it pleasant and airy.

The first stall was a large square one, shut in behind with a wooden gate; the others were common stalls, good stalls, but not nearly so large; it had a low rack for hay and a low manger for corn; it was called a loose box, because the horse that was put into it was not tied up, but left loose, to do as he liked. It is a great thing to have a loose box.

Into this fine box the groom put me; it was clean, sweet, and airy. I never was in a better box than that, and the sides were not so high but that I could see all that went on through the iron rails that were at the top.

He gave me some very nice oats, he patted me, spoke kindly, and then went away.

When I had eaten my corn I looked round. In the stall next to mine stood a little fat gray pony, with a thick mane and tail, a very pretty head, and a pert little nose.

I put my head up to the iron rails at the top of my box, and said,“How do you do? What is your name?”

He turned round as far as his halter would allow, held up his head, and said,“My name is Merrylegs. I am very handsome; I carry the young ladies on my back, and sometimes I take our mistress out in the low chair. They think a great deal of me, and so does James. Are you going to live next door to me in the box?”

I said,“Yes.”

“Well, then,”he said,“I hope you are good-tempered; I do not like any one next door who bites.”

Just then a horse's head looked over from the stall beyond; the ears were laid back, and the eye looked rather ill-tempered. This was a tall chestnut mare, with a long handsome neck; she looked across to me and said:

“So it is you who have turned me out of my box; it is a very strange thing for a colt like you, to come and turn a lady out of her own home.”

“I beg your pardon,”I said,“I have turned no one out; the man who brought me put me here, and I had nothing to do with it; and as to my being a colt, I am turned four years old, and am a grown-up horse; I never had words yet with horse or mare, and it is my wish to live at peace.”

“Well,”she said,“we shall see; of course I do not want to have words with a young thing like you.”I said no more.

In the afternoon when she went out, Merrylegs told me all about it.

“The thing is this,”said Merrylegs,“Ginger has a bad habit of biting and snapping; that is why they call her Ginger, and when she was in the loose box, she used to snap very much. One day she bit James in the arm and made it bleed, and so Miss Flora and Miss Jessie, who are very fond of me, were afraid to come into the stable. They used to bring me nice things to eat, an apple or a carrot, or a piece of bread, but after Ginger stood in that box they dared not come, and I missed them very much. I hope they will now come again, if you do not bite or snap.”

I told him I never bit anything but grass, hay, and corn, and could not think what pleasure Ginger found in it.

“Well, I don't think she does find pleasure,”says Merrylegs;“it is just a bad habit; she says no one was ever kind to her, and why should she not bite? Of course, it is a very bad habit; but I am sure, if all she says be true, she must have been very ill-used before she came here. John does all he can to please her, and James does all he can, and our master never uses a whip if a horse acts right; so I think she might be good-tempered here. You see,”he said, with a wise look,“I am twelve years old; I know a great deal, and I can tell you there is not a better place for a horse all round the country than this. John is the best groom that ever was; he has been here fourteen years; and you never saw such a kind boy as James is; so that it is all Ginger's own fault that she did not stay in that box.”





05　A Fair Start


The name of the coachman was John Manly; he had a wife and one little child, and they lived in the coachman's cottage, very near the stables.

The next morning he took me into the yard and gave me a good grooming, and just as I was going into my box, with my coat soft and bright, the Squire came in to look at me, and seemed pleased.“John,”he said,“I meant to have tried the new horse this morning, but I have other business. You may as well take him around after breakfast; go by the common and the Highwood, and back by the water-mill and the river; that will show his paces.”

“I will, sir,”said John. After breakfast he came and fitted me with a bridle. He was very particular in letting out and taking in the straps, to fit my head comfortably; then he brought a saddle, but it was not broad enough for my back; he saw it in a minute and went for another, which fitted nicely. He rode me first slowly, then a trot, then a canter, and when we were on the common he gave me a light touch with his whip, and we had a splendid gallop.

“Ho, ho! my boy,”he said, as he pulled me up,“you would like to follow the hounds, I think.”

As we came back through the Park we met the Squire and Mrs. Gordon walking; they stopped, and John jumped off.

“Well, John, how does he go?”

“First-rate, sir,”answered John,“he is as fieet as a deer, and has a fine spirit too; but the lightest touch of the rein will guide him. Down at the end of the common we met one of those traveling carts hung all over with baskets, rugs, and such like; you know, sir, many horses will not pass those carts quietly; he just took a good look at it, and then went on as quiet and pleasant as could be. They were shooting rabbits near the Highwood, and a gun went off close by; he pulled up a little and looked, but did not stir a step to right or left. I just held the rein steady and did not hurry him, and it's my opinion he has not been frightened or ill-used while he was young.”

“That's well,”said the Squire,“I will try him myself tomorrow.”

The next day I was brought up for my master. I remembered my mother's counsel and my good old master's, and I tried to do exactly what he wanted me to do. I found he was a very good rider, and thoughtful for his horse too. When he came home the lady was at the Hall door as he rode up.

“Well, my dear,”she said,“how do you like him?”

“He is exactly what John said,”he replied;“a pleasanter creature I never wish to mount. What shall we call him?”

“Would you like Ebony?”said she;“He is as black as ebony.”

“No, not Ebony.”

“Will you call him Blackbird, like your uncle's old horse?”

“No, he is far handsomer than old Blackbird ever was.”

“Yes,”she said,“he is really quite a beauty, and he has such a sweet, good-tempered face, and such a fine, intelligent eye—what do you say to calling him Black Beauty?”

“Black Beauty—why, yes, I think that is a very good name. If you like it shall be his name,”and so it was.

When John went into the stable, he told James that master and mistress had chosen a good sensible English name for me, that meant something, not like Marengo, or Pegasus, or Abdallah. They both laughed, and James said,“If it was not for bringing back the past, I should have named him Rob Roy, for I never saw two horses more alike.”

“That's no wonder,”said John;“didn't you know that Farmer Grey's old Duchess was the mother of them both?”

I had never heard that before, and so poor Rob Roy who was killed at that hunt was my brother! I did not wonder that my mother was so troubled. It seems that horses have no relations; at least, they never know each other after they are sold.

John seemed very proud of me: he used to make my mane and tail almost as smooth as a lady's hair, and he would talk to me a great deal; of course I did not understand all he said, but I learned more and more to know what he meant , and what he wanted me to do. I grew very fond of him, he was so gentle and kind; he seemed to know just how a horse feels, and when he cleaned me he knew the tender places, and the ticklish places; when he brushed my head, he went as carefully over my eyes as if they were his own, and never stirred up any ill-temper.

James Howard, the stable boy, was just as gentle and pleasant in his way, so I thought myself well off. There was another man who helped in the yard, but he had very little to do with Ginger and me.

A few days after this I had to go out with Ginger in the carriage. I wondered how we should get on together; but except laying her ears back when I was led up to her, she behaved very well. She did her work honestly, and did her full share, and I never wish to have a better partner in double harness. When we came to a hill, instead of slackening her pace, she would throw her weight right into the collar, and pull away straight up. We both had the same sort of courage at our work, and John had oftener to hold us in, than to urge us forward; he never had to use the whip with either of us; then our paces were much the same, and I found it very easy to keep step with her when trotting, which made it pleasant, and master always liked it when we kept step well, and so did John. After we had been out two or three times together we grew quite friendly and sociable, which made me feel very much at home.

As for Merrylegs, he and I soon became great friends; he was such a cheerful, plucky, good-tempered little fellow, that he was a favorite with everyone, and especially with Miss Jessie and Flora, who used to ride him about in the orchard, and have fine games with him and their little dog Frisky.

Our master had two other horses that stood in another stable. One was Justice, a roan cob, used for riding, or for the luggage cart; the other was an old brown hunter, named Sir Oliver; he was past work now, but was a great favorite with the master, who gave him the run of the Park; he sometimes did a little light carting on the estate, or carried one of the young ladies when they rode out with their father; for he was very gentle, and could be trusted with a child as well as Merrylegs. The cob was a strong, well-made, good-tempered horse, and we sometimes had a little chat in the paddock, but of course I could not be so intimate with him as with Ginger, who stood in the same stable.





06　Liberty


I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed, it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good, and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain, where he can fling up his head, and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions—I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, I have felt so full of life and spring, that when John has taken me out to exercise, I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.

“Steady, steady, my boy,”he would say;“wait a bit, and we will have a good swing, and soon get the tickle out of your feet.”Then as soon as we were out of the village, he would give me a few miles at a spanking trot, and then bring me back as fresh as before, only clear of the fidgets, as he called them. Spirited horses, when not enough exercised, are often called skittish, when it is only play; and some grooms will punish them, but our John did not, he knew it was only high spirits. Still, he had his own ways of making me understand by the tone of his voice or the touch of the rein. If he was very serious and quite determined, I always knew it by his voice, and that had more power with me than anything else, for I was very fond of him.

I ought to say that sometimes we had our liberty for a few hours; this used to be on fine Sundays in the summer-time. The carriage never went out on Sundays, because the church was not far off.

It was a great treat to us to be turned out into the Home Paddock or the old orchard. The grass was so cool and soft to our feet; the air so sweet, and the freedom to do as we liked was so pleasant; to gallop, to lie down, and roll over on our backs, or to nibble the sweet grass. Then it was a very good time for talking, as we stood together under the shade of the large chestnut tree.





07　Ginger


One day when Ginger and I were standing alone in the shade, we had a great deal of talk; she wanted to know all about my bringing up and breaking in, and I told her.

“Well,”said she,“if I had had your bringing up I might have had as good a temper as you are, but now I don't believe I ever shall.”

“Why not?”I said.

“Because it has been all so different with me,”she replied;“I never had any one, horse or man, that was kind to me, or that I cared to please; for in the first place I was taken from my mother as soon as I was weaned, and put with a lot of other young colts; none of them cared for me, and I cared for none of them. There was no kind master like yours to look after me, and talk to me, and bring me nice things to eat. The man that had the care of us never gave me a kind word in my life. I do not mean that he ill-used me, but he did not care for us one bit further than to see that we had plenty to eat, and shelter in the winter. A footpath ran through our field, and very often the great boys passing through would fling stones to make us gallop. I was never hit, but one fine young colt was badly cut in the face, and I should think it would be a scar for life. We did not care for them, but of course it made us more wild, and we settled it in our minds that boys were our enemies. We had very good fun in the free meadows, galloping up and down and chasing each other round and round the field; then standing still under the shade of the trees. But when it came to breaking in, that was a bad time for me; several men came to catch me, and when at last they closed me in at one corner of the field, one caught me by the forelock, another caught me by the nose, and held it so tight I could hardly draw my breath; then another took my under jaw in his hard hand and wrenched my mouth open, and so by force they got on the halter and the bar into my mouth; then one dragged me along by the halter, another fiogging behind, and this was the first experience I had of men's kindness; it was all force. They did not give me a chance to know what they wanted. I was high bred and had a good deal of spirit, and was very wild, no doubt, and gave them, I dare say, plenty of trouble, but then it was dreadful to be shut up in a stall day after day instead of having my liberty, and I fretted and pined and wanted to get loose. You know yourself, it's bad enough when you have a kind master and plenty of coaxing, but there was nothing of that sort for me.

“There was one—the old master, Mr. Ryder—who, I think, could soon have brought me round, and could have done anything with me, but he had given up all the hard part of the trade to his son and to another experienced man, and he only came at times to oversee. His son was a strong, tall, bold man; they called him Samson, and he used to boast that he had never found a horse that could throw him. There was no gentleness in him, as there was in his father, but only hardness, a hard voice, a hard eye, a hard hand; and I felt from the first that what he wanted was to wear all the spirit out of me, and just make me into a quiet, humble, obedient piece of horsefiesh. ‘Horsefiesh!’ Yes, that is all that he thought about,”and Ginger stamped her foot as if the very thought of him made her angry. Then she went on:

“If I did not do exactly what he wanted, he would get put out, and make me run round with that long rein in the training field till he had tired me out. I think he drank a good deal, and I am quite sure that the oftener he drank the worse it was for me. One day he had worked me hard in every way he could, and when I lay down I was tired and miserable and angry; it all seemed so hard. The next morning he came for me early, and ran me round again for a long time. I had scarcely had an hour's rest, when he came again for me with a saddle and bridle and a new kind of bit. I could never quite tell how it came about; he had only just mounted me on the training ground, when something I did put him out of temper, and he chucked me hard with the rein. The new bit was very painful, and I reared up suddenly, which angered him still more, and he began to fiog me. I felt my whole spirit set against him, and I began to kick and plunge, and rear as I had never done before, and we had a regular fight; for a long time he stuck to the saddle and punished me cruelly with his whip and spurs, but my blood was thoroughly up, and I cared for nothing he could do if only I could get him off. At last, after a terrible struggle, I threw him off backward. I heard him fall heavily on the turf, and without looking behind me, I galloped off to the other end of the field; there I turned round and saw my persecutor slowly rising from the ground and going into the stable. I stood under an oak tree and watched, but no one came to catch me. The time went on, the sun was very hot; the flies swarmed round me, and settled on my bleeding fianks where the spurs had dug in. I felt hungry, for I had not eaten since the early morning, but there was not enough grass in that meadow for a goose to live on. I wanted to lie down and rest, but with the saddle strapped tightly on, there was no comfort, and there was not a drop of water to drink. The afternoon wore on, and the sun got low. I saw the other colts led in, and I knew they were having a good feed.

“At last, just as the sun went down, I saw the old master come out with a sieve in his hand. He was a very fine old gentleman with quite white hair, but his voice was what I should know him by amongst a thousand. It was not high, nor yet low, but full, and clear, and kind, and when he gave orders it was so steady and decided that everyone knew, both horses and men, that he expected to be obeyed. He came quietly along, now and then shaking the oats about that he had in the sieve, and speaking cheerfully and gently to me, ‘Come along, lassie, come along, lassie; come along, come along.’ I stood still and let him come up; he held the oats to me, and I began to eat without fear; his voice took all my fear away. He stood by, patting and stroking me while I was eating, and seeing the clots of blood on my side he seemed very vexed. ‘Poor lassie! it was a bad business, a bad business!’ then he quietly took the rein and led me to the stable; just at the door stood Samson. I laid my ears back and snapped at him. ‘Stand back,’ said the master, ‘and keep out of her way; you've done a bad day's work for this filly.’ He growled out something about a vicious brute. ‘Hark ye,’ said the father, ‘a bad-tempered man will never make a good-tempered horse. You've not learned your trade yet, Samson.’ Then he led me into my box, took off the saddle and bridle with his own hands and tied me up; then he called for a pail of warm water and a sponge, took off his coat, and while the stable man held the pail, he sponged my sides a good while so tenderly that I was sure he knew how sore and bruised they were. ‘Whoa! my pretty one,’ he said, ‘stand still, stand still.’ His very voice did me good, and the bathing was very comfortable. The skin was so broken at the corners of my mouth that I could not eat the hay, the stalks hurt me. He looked closely at it, shook his head, and told the man to fetch a good bran mash and put some meal into it. How good that mash was! and so soft and healing to my mouth. He stood by all the time I was eating, stroking me and talking to the man. ‘If a high-mettled creature like this,’ said he, ‘can't be broken in by fair means, she will never be good for anything.’

“After that he often came to see me, and when my mouth was healed, the other breaker, Job they called him, went on training me; he was steady and thoughtful, and I soon learned what he wanted.”





08　Ginger's Story Continued


The next time that Ginger and I were together in the paddock, she told me about her first place.

“After my breaking in,”she said,“I was bought by a dealer to match another chestnut horse. For some weeks he drove us together, and then we were sold to a fashionable gentleman, and were sent up to London. I had been driven with a bearing rein by the dealer, and I hated it worse than anything else; but in this place we were reined far tighter; the coachman and his master thinking we looked more stylish. We were often driven about in the Park and other fashionable places. You who never had a bearing rein on don't know what it is, but I can tell you it is dreadful.

“I like to toss my head about, and hold it as high as any horse; but fancy now yourself, if you tossed your head up high and were obliged to hold it there, and that for hours together, not able to move it at all, except with a jerk still higher, your neck aching till you did not know how to bear it. Besides that, to have two bits instead of one—and mine was a sharp one, it hurt my tongue and my jaw, and the blood from my tongue colored the froth that kept fiying from my lips, as I chafed and fretted at the bits and rein. It was worst when we had to stand by the hour waiting for our mistress at some grand party or entertainment; and if I fretted or stamped with impatience the whip was laid on. It was enough to drive one mad.”

“Did not your master take any thought for you?”I said.

“No,”said she,“he only cared to have a stylish turn-out, as they call it; I think he knew very little about horses, he left that to his coachman, who told him I had an irritable temper; that I had not been well broken to the bearing rein, but I should soon get used to it; but he was not the man to do it, for when I was in the stable, miserable and angry, instead of being smoothed and quieted by kindness, I got only a surly word or a blow. If he had been civil, I would have tried to bear it. I was willing to work, and ready to work hard too; but to be tormented for nothing but their fancies angered me. What right had they to make me suffer like that? Besides the soreness in my mouth and the pain in my neck, it always made my windpipe feel bad, and if I had stopped there long, I know it would have spoiled my breathing; but I grew more and more restless and irritable, I could not help it; and I began to snap and kick when any one came to harness me; for this the groom beat me, and one day, as they had just buckled us into the carriage, and were straining my head up with that rein, I began to plunge and kick with all my might. I soon broke a lot of harness, and kicked myself clear; so that was an end of that place.

“After this, I was sent to Tattersall's to be sold; of course I could not be warranted free from vice, so nothing was said about that. My handsome appearance and good paces soon brought a gentleman to bid for me, and I was bought by another dealer; he tried me in all kinds of ways and with different bits, and soon found out what I could bear. At last he drove me quite without a bearing rein, and then sold me as a perfectly quiet horse to a gentleman in the country; he was a good master, and I was getting on very well, but his old groom left him and a new one came. This man was as hard-tempered and hard-handed as Samson; he always spoke in a rough, impatient voice, and if I did not move in the stall the moment he wanted me, he would hit me above the hocks with his stable broom or the fork, whichever he might have in his hand. Everything he did was rough, and I began to hate him; he wanted to make me afraid of him, but I was too high-mettled for that; and one day when he had aggravated me more than usual, I bit him, which of course put him in a great rage, and he began to hit me about the head with a riding whip. After that he never dared to come into my stall again, either my heels or my teeth were ready for him, and he knew it. I was quite quiet with my master, but of course he listened to what the man said, and so I was sold again.

“The same dealer heard of me, and said he thought he knew one place where I should do well. ‘'twas a pity,’ he said, ‘that such a fine horse should go to the bad for want of a real good chance,’ and the end of it was that I came here not long before you did; but I had then made up my mind that men were my natural enemies, and that I must defend myself. Of course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last? I wish I could think about things as you do; but I can't, after all I have gone through.”

“Well,”I said,“I think it would be a real shame if you were to bite or kick John or James.”

“I don't mean to,”she said,“while they are good to me. I did bite James once pretty sharp, but John said, ‘Try her with kindness,’ and instead of punishing me as I expected, James came to me with his arm bound up, and brought me a bran mash and stroked me; and I have never snapped at him since, and I won't either.”

I was sorry for Ginger, but of course I knew very little then, and I thought most likely she made the worst of it; however, I found that as the weeks went on, she grew much more gentle and cheerful, and had lost the watchful, defiant look that she used to turn on any strange person who came near her; and one day James said,“I do believe that mare is getting fond of me, she quite whinnied after me this morning when I had been rubbing her forehead.”

“Aye, aye, Jim, 'tis the Birtwick balls,”said John,“she'll be as good as Black Beauty by and by; kindness is all the physic she wants, poor thing!”Master noticed the change too, and one day when he got out of the carriage and came to speak to us as he often did, he stroked her beautiful neck.“Well, my pretty one, well, how do things go with you now? You are a good bit happier than when you came to us, I think.”

She put her nose up to him in a friendly, trustful way, while he rubbed it gently.

“We shall make a cure of her, John,”he said.

“Yes, sir, she's wonderfully improved; she's not the same creature that she was; it's the Birtwick balls, sir,”said John, laughing.

This was a little joke of John's; he used to say that a regular course of the Birtwick horse-balls would cure almost any vicious horse; these balls, he said, were made up of patience and gentleness, firmness and petting, one pound of each to be mixed up with half-a-pint of common sense, and given to the horse every day.





09　 Merrylegs


Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls; sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and there were several little ones. When they came, there was plenty of work for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and this they would do by the hour together.

One afternoon he had been out with them a long time, and when James brought him in and put on his halter, he said:

“There, you rogue, mind how you behave yourself, or we shall get into trouble.”

“What have you been doing, Merrylegs?”I asked.

“Oh!”said he, tossing his little head,“I have only been giving those young people a lesson, they did not know when they had had enough, nor when I had had enough, so I just pitched them off backward, that was the only thing they could understand.”

“What!”said I,“you threw the children off? I thought you did know better than that! Did you throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora?”

He looked very much offended, and said:

“Of course not. I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the master could be, and as for the little ones, it is I who teach them to ride. When they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back I go as smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird; and when they are all right, I go on again faster, you see, just to use them to it; so don't you trouble yourself preaching to me; I am the best friend and the best riding-master those children have. It is not them, it is the boys; boys,”said he, shaking his mane,“are quite different; they must be broken in, as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught what's what. The other children had ridden me about for nearly two hours, and then the boys thought it was their turn, and so it was, and I was quite agreeable. They rode me by turns, and I galloped them about, up and down the fields and all about the orchard, for a good hour. They had each cut a great hazel stick for a riding-whip, and laid it on a little too hard; but I took it in good part, till at last I thought we had had enough, so I stopped two or three times by way of a hint. Boys, you see, think a horse or pony is like a steam-engine or a thrashing-machine, and can go on as long and as fast as they please; they never think that a pony can get tired, or have any feelings; so as the one who was whipping me could not understand, I just rose up on my hind legs and let him slip off behind—that was all; he mounted me again, and I did the same. Then the other boy got up, and as soon as he began to use his stick I laid him on the grass, and so on, till they were able to understand—that was all. They are not bad boys; they don't wish to be cruel. I like them very well; but you see I had to give them a lesson. When they brought me to James and told him, I think he was very angry to see such big sticks. He said they were only fit for drovers or gypsies, and not for young gentlemen.”

“If I had been you,”said Ginger,“I would have given those boys a good kick, and that would have given them a lesson.”

“No doubt you would,”said Merrylegs,“but then I am not quite such a fool (begging your pardon) as to anger our master or make James ashamed of me; besides, those children are under my charge when they are riding; I tell you they are entrusted to me. Why, only the other day I heard our master say to Mrs. Blomefield, ‘My dear madam, you need not be anxious about the children, my old Merrylegs will take as much care of them as you or I could: I assure you I would not sell that pony for any money, he is so perfectly good-tempered and trustworthy;’ and do you think I am such an ungrateful brute as to forget all the kind treatment I have had here for five years, and all the trust they place in me, and turn vicious because a couple of ignorant boys used me badly? No, no! you never had a good place where they were kind to you; and so you don't know, and I'm sorry for you, but I can tell you good places make good horses. I wouldn't vex our people for anything; I love them, I do,”said Merrylegs and he gave a low“ho, ho, ho”through his nose, as he used to do in the morning when he heard James' footstep at the door.

“Besides,”he went on,“if I took to kicking, where should I be? Why, sold off in a jiffy, and no character, and I might find myself slaved about under a butcher's boy, or worked to death at some seaside place where no one cared for me, except to find out how fast I could go, or be fiogged along in some cart with three or four great men in it going out for a Sunday spree, as I have often seen in the place I lived in before I came here; no,”said he, shaking his head,“I hope I shall never come to that.”





10　A Talk in the Orchard


Ginger and I were not of the regular tall carriage horse breed, we had more of the racing blood in us. We stood about fifteen and a half hands high; we were therefore just as good for riding as we were for driving, and our master used to say that he disliked either horse or man that could do but one thing; and as he did not want to show off in London parks, he preferred a more active and useful kind of horse. As for us, our greatest pleasure was when we were saddled for a riding party; the master on Ginger, the mistress on me, and the young ladies on Sir Oliver and Merrylegs. It was so cheerful to be trotting and cantering all together, that it always put us in high spirits. I had the best of it, for I always carried the mistress; her weight was little, her voice was sweet, and her hand was so light on the rein, that I was guided almost without feeling it.

Oh! if people knew what a comfort to horses a light hand is, and how it keeps a good mouth and a good temper, they surely would not chuck, and drag, and pull at the rein as they often do. Our mouths are so tender, that where they have not been spoiled or hardened with bad or ignorant treatment, they feel the slightest movement of the driver's hand, and we know in an instant what is required of us. My mouth had never been spoiled, and I believe that was why the mistress preferred me to Ginger, although her paces were certainly quite as good. She used often to envy me, and said it was all the fault of breaking in, and the gag bit in London, that her mouth was not so perfect as mine; and then old Sir Oliver would say,“There, there! don't vex yourself; you have the greatest honor; a mare that can carry a tall man of our master's weight, with all your spring and sprightly action, does not need to hold her head down because she does not carry the lady; we horses must take things as they come, and always be contented and willing so long as we are kindly used.”

I had often wondered how it was that Sir Oliver had such a very short tail; it really was only six or seven inches long, with a tassel of hair hanging from it; and on one of our holidays in the orchard I ventured to ask him by what accident it was that he had lost his tail.“Accident!”he snorted, with a fierce look,“it was no accident! it was a cruel, shameful, cold-blooded act! When I was young I was taken to a place where these cruel things were done; I was tied up, and made fast so that I could not stir, and then they came and cut off my long and beautiful tail, through the fiesh, and through the bone, and took it away.

“How dreadful!”I exclaimed.

“Dreadful! ah! it was dreadful; but it was not only the pain, though that was terrible and lasted a long time; it was not only the indignity of having my best ornament taken from me, though that was bad; but it was this, how could I ever brush the fiies off my sides and my hind legs any more? You who have tails just whisk the fiies off without thinking about it, and you can't tell what a torment it is to have them settle upon you and sting and sting, and have nothing in the world to lash them off with. I tell you it is a life-long wrong, and a life-long loss; but thank heaven, they don't do it now.”

“What did they do it for then?”said Ginger.

“For fashion!”said the old horse with a stamp of his foot;“for fashion! if you know what that means; there was not a well-bred young horse in my time that had not his tail docked in that shameful way, just as if the good God that made us did not know what we wanted and what looked best.”

“I suppose it is fashion that makes them strap our heads up with those horrid bits that I was tortured with in London,”said Ginger.

“Of course it is,”said he;“to my mind, fashion is one of the wickedest things in the world. Now look, for instance, at the way they serve dogs, cutting off their tails to make them look plucky, and shearing up their pretty little ears to a point to make them look sharp, forsooth! I had a dear friend once, a brown terrier—‘Skye’ they called her; she was so fond of me that she never would sleep out of my stall; she made her bed under the manger, and there she had a litter of five as pretty little puppies as need be; none were drowned, for they were a valuable kind, and how pleased she was with them! And when they got their eyes open and crawled about, it was a real pretty sight; but one day the man came and took them all away; I thought he might be afraid I should tread upon them. But it was not so; in the evening poor Skye brought them back again, one by one in her mouth; not the happy little things that they were, but bleeding and crying pitifully; they had all had a piece of their tails cut off, and the soft fiap of their pretty little ears was cut quite off. How their mother licked them, and how troubled she was, poor thing! I never forgot it. They healed in time, and they forgot the pain, but the nice soft fiap that of course was intended to protect the delicate part of their ears from dust and injury was gone forever. Why don't they cut their own children's ears into points to make them look sharp? Why don't they cut the end off their noses to make them look plucky? One would be just as sensible as the other. What right have they to torment and disfigure God's creatures?”

Sir Oliver, though he was so gentle, was a fiery old fellow, and what he said was all so new to me and so dreadful that I found a bitter feeling towards men rise up in my mind that I never had before. Of course Ginger was much excited; she fiung up her head with fiashing eyes, and distended nostrils, declaring that men were both brutes and blockheads.

“Who talks about blockheads?”said Merrylegs, who just came up from the old apple-tree, where he had been rubbing himself against the low branch.“Who talks about blockheads? I believe that is a bad word.”

“Bad words were made for bad things,”said Ginger, and she told him what Sir Oliver had said.

“It is all true,”said Merrylegs sadly,“and I've seen that about the dogs over and over again where I lived first; but we won't talk about it here. You know that master, and John, and James are always good to us, and talking against men in such a place as this doesn't seem fair or grateful, and you know there are good masters and good grooms beside ours, though of course ours are the best.”

This wise speech of good little Merrylegs, which we knew was quite true, cooled us all down, especially Sir Oliver, who was dearly fond of his master; and to turn the subject I said,“Can any one tell me the use of blinkers?”

“No!”said Sir Oliver shortly,“because they are no use.”

“They are supposed,”said Justice, the roan cob, in his calm way,“to prevent horses from shying and starting, and getting so frightened as to cause accidents.”

“Then what is the reason they do not put them on riding horses; especially on ladies' horses?”said I.

“There is no reason at all,”said he quietly,“except the fashion; they say that a horse would be so frightened to see the wheels of his own cart or carriage coming behind him, that he would be sure to run away, although of course when he is ridden, he sees them all about him if the streets are crowded. I admit they do sometimes come too close to be pleasant, but we don't run away; we are used to it, and understand it, and if we never had blinkers put on, we should never want them; we should see what was there, and know what was what, and be much less frightened than by only seeing bits of things that we can't understand. Of course there may be some nervous horses who have been hurt or frightened when they were young, who may be the better for them, but as I never was nervous, I can't judge.”

“I consider,”said Sir Oliver,“that blinkers are dangerous things in the night; we horses can see much better in the dark than men can, and many an accident would never have happened if horses might have had the full use of their eyes. Some years ago, I remember, there was a hearse with two horses returning one dark night, and just by Farmer Sparrow's house, where the pond is close to the road, the wheels went too near the edge, and the hearse was overturned into the water; both the horses were drowned, and the driver hardly escaped. Of course after this accident a stout white rail was put up that might be easily seen, but if those horses had not been partly blinded, they would of themselves have kept farther from the edge, and no accident would have happened. When our master's carriage was overturned, before you came here, it was said that if the lamp on the left side had not gone out, John would have seen the great hole that the road-makers had left; and so he might, but if old Colin had not had blinkers on, he would have seen it, lamp or no lamp, for he was far too knowing an old horse to run into danger. As it was, he was very much hurt, the carriage was broken, and how John escaped nobody knew.”

“I should say,”said Ginger, curling her nostril,“that these men, who are so wise, had better give orders that in future all foals should be born with their eyes set just in the middle of their foreheads, instead of on the side; they always think they can improve upon Nature and mend what God has made.”

Things were getting rather sore again, when Merrylegs held up his knowing little face and said,“I'll tell you a secret: I believe John does not approve of blinkers; I heard him talking with master about it one day. The master said that ‘if horses had been used to them, it might be dangerous in some cases to leave them off;’ and John said he thought it would be a good thing if all colts were broken in without blinkers, as was the case in some foreign countries. So let us cheer up, and have a run to the other end of the orchard; I believe the wind has blown down some apples, and we might just as well eat them as the slugs.”

Merrylegs could not be resisted, so we broke off our long con-versation, and got up our spirits by munching some very sweet apples which lay scattered on the grass.





11　Plain Speaking


The longer I lived at Birtwick, the more proud and happy I felt at having such a place. Our master and mistress were respected and beloved by all who knew them; they were good and kind to everybody and everything; not only men and women, but horses and donkeys, dogs and cats, cattle and birds; there was no oppressed or ill-used creature that had not a friend in them, and their servants took the same tone. If any of the village children were known to treat any creature cruelly, they soon heard about it from the Hall.

The Squire and Farmer Grey had worked together, as they said, for more than twenty years, to get bearing reins on the carthorses done away with, and in our parts you seldom saw them; and sometimes, if mistress met a heavily laden horse, with his head strained up, she would stop the carriage and get out, and reason with the driver in her sweet serious voice, and try to show him how foolish and cruel it was.

I don't think any man could withstand our mistress. I wish all ladies were like her. Our master too used to come down very heavy sometimes. I remember he was riding me towards home one morning, when we saw a powerful man driving towards us in a light pony chaise, with a beautiful little bay pony, with slender legs, and a high-bred sensitive head and face. Just as he came to the Park gates, the little thing turned toward them; the man, without word or warning, wrenched the creature's head round with such a force and suddenness that he nearly threw it on its haunches. Recovering itself, it was going on, when he began to lash it furiously; the pony plunged forward, but the strong, heavy hand held the pretty creature back with force almost enough to break its jaw, while the whip still cut into him. It was a dreadful sight to me, for I knew what fearful pain it gave that delicate little mouth; but master gave me the word, and we were up with him in a second.

“Sawyer,”he cried in a stern voice,“is that pony made of fiesh and blood?”

“Flesh and blood and temper,”he said;“he's too fond of his own will, and that won't suit me.”He spoke as if he was in a strong passion; he was a builder who had often been to the Park on business.

“And do you think,”said master sternly,“that treatment like this will make him fond of your will?”

“He had no business to make that turn; his road was straight on!”said the man roughly.

“You have often driven that pony up to my place,”said master;“it only shows the creature's memory and intelligence; how did he know that you were not going there again? But that has little to do with it. I must say, Mr. Sawyer, that more unmanly, brutal treatment of a little pony it was never my painful lot to witness, and by giving way to such passion you injure your own character as much, nay more, than you injure your horse, and remember, we shall all have to be judged according to our works, whether they be towards man or towards beast.”

Master rode me home slowly, and I could tell by his voice how the thing had grieved him. He was just as free to speak to gentlemen of his own rank as to those below him; for another day, when we were out, we met a Captain Langley, a friend of our master's; he was driving a splendid pair of greys in a kind of break. After a little conversation the captain said:

“What do you think of my new team, Mr. Douglas? You know, you are the judge of horses in these parts, and I should like your opinion.”

The master backed me a little, so as to get a good view of them.“They are an uncommonly handsome pair,”he said,“and if they are as good as they look, I am sure you need not wish for anything better; but I see you got hold of that pet scheme of yours for worrying your horses and lessening their power.”

“What do you mean,”said the other,“the bearing reins? Oh, ah! I know that's a hobby of yours; well, the fact is, I like to see my horses hold their heads up.”

“So do I,”said master,“as well as any man, but I don't like to see them held up; that takes all the shine out of it. Now, you are a military man, Langley, and no doubt like to see your regiment look well on parade, ‘Heads up,’ and all that; but you would not take much credit for your drill if all your men had their heads tied to a backboard! It might not be much harm on parade, except to worry and fatigue them, but how would it be in a bayonet charge against the enemy, when they want the free use of every muscle, and all their strength thrown forward? I would not give much for their chance of victory. And it is just the same with horses: you fret and worry their tempers, and decrease their power; you will not let them throw their weight against their work, and so they have to do too much with their joints and muscles, and of course it wears them up faster. You may depend upon it, horses were intended to have their heads free, as free as men's are; and if we could act a little more according to common sense, and a good deal less according to fashion, we should find many things work easier; besides you know as well as I that, if a horse makes a false step, he has much less chance of recovering himself if his head and neck are fastened back. And now,”said the master, laughing,“I have given my hobby a good trot out, can't you make up your mind to mount him, too, Captain? Your example would go a long way.”

“I believe you are right in theory,”said the other,“and that's rather a hard hit about the soldiers; but—well—I'll think about it,”and so they parted.





12　A Stormy Day


One day late in the autumn, my master had a long journey to go on business. I was put into the dog-cart, and John went with his master. I always liked to go in the dog-cart, it was so light, and the high wheels ran along so pleasantly. There had been a great deal of rain, and now the wind was very high, and blew the dry leaves across the road in a shower. We went along merrily till we came to the toll-bar and the low wooden bridge. The river banks were rather high, and the bridge, instead of rising, went across just level, so that in the middle, if the river was full, the water would be nearly up to the woodwork and planks; but as there were good substantial rails on each side, people did not mind it.

The man at the gate said the river was rising fast, and he feared it would be a bad night. Many of the meadows were under water, and in one low part of the road the water was half way up to my knees; the bottom was good, and the master drove gently, so it was no matter.

When we got to the town, of course, I had a good bait, but as the master's business engaged him a long time, we did not start for home till rather late in the afternoon. The wind was then much higher, and I heard the master say to John, he had never been out in such a storm; and so I thought, as we went along the skirts of a wood, where the great branches were swaying about like twigs, and the rushing sound was terrible.

“I wish we were well out of this wood,”said my master.

“Yes, sir,”said John,“it would be rather awkward if one of these branches came down upon us.”

The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when there was a groan, and a crack, and a splitting sound, and tearing crashing down among the other trees came an oak, torn up by the roots, and it fell right across the road just before us. I will never say I was not frightened, for I was. I stopped still, and I believe I trembled; of course, I did not turn round or run away; I was not brought up to that. John jumped out and was in a moment at my head.

“That was a very near touch,”said my master.“What's to be done now?”

“Well, sir, we can't drive over that tree nor yet get round it; there will be nothing for it but to go back to the four cross-ways, and that will be a good six miles before we get round to the wooden bridge again; it will make us late, but the horse is fresh.”

So back we went, and round by the cross roads, but by the time we got to the bridge it was very nearly dark, we could just see that the water was over the middle of it; but as that happened sometimes when the fioods were out, master did not stop. We were going along at a good pace, but the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there was something wrong. I dare not go forward, and I made a dead stop.“Go on, Beauty,”said my master, and he gave me a touch with the whip, but I dare not stir; he gave me a sharp cut, I jumped, but I dare not go forward.

“There's something wrong, sir,”said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward.“Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?”Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe.

Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.

“Hoy, hoy, hoy, Halloo! stop!”he cried.

“What's the matter?”shouted my master.

“The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you'll be into the river.”

“Thank God!”said my master.“You Beauty!”said John and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time, the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was fiowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves, but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men. John had many stories to tell of dogs and horses, and the wonderful things they had done; he thought people did not value their animals half enough, nor make friends of them as they ought to do. I am sure he makes friends of them if ever a man did.

At last we came to the Park gates, and found the gardener looking out for us. He said that mistress had been in a dreadful way ever since dark, fearing some accident had happened, and that she had sent James off on Justice, the roan cob, toward the wooden bridge to make inquiry after us.

We saw a light at the hall door and at the upper windows, and as we came up mistress ran out, saying,“Are you really safe, my dear? Oh! I have been so anxious, fancying all sorts of things. Have you had no accident?”

“No, my dear; but if your Black Beauty had not been wiser than we were, we should all have been carried down the river at the wooden bridge.”I heard no more, as they went into the house, and John took me to the stable. Oh, what a good supper he gave me that night, a good bran mash and some crushed beans with my oats, and such a thick bed of straw! and I was glad of it, for I was tired.





13　The Devil's Trade Mark


One day when John and I had been out on some business of our master's, and were returning gently on a long, straight road, at some distance we saw a boy trying to leap a pony over a gate; the pony would not take the leap, and the boy cut him with the whip, but he only turned off on one side, he whipped him again, but the pony turned off on the other side. Then the boy got off and gave him a hard thrashing, and knocked him about the head; then he got up again and tried to make him leap the gate, kicking him all the time shamefully, but still the pony refused. When we were nearly at the spot, the pony put down his head and threw up his heels, and sent the boy neatly over into a broad quickset hedge, and with the rein dangling from his head, he set off home at a full gallop. John laughed out quite loud.“Served him right,”he said.

“Oh, oh, oh!”cried the boy, as he struggled about among the thorns.“I say, come and help me out.”

“Thank ye,”said John,“I think you are quite in the right place, and maybe a little scratching will teach you not to leap a pony over a gate that is too high for him,”and so with that John rode off.“It may be,”said he to himself,“that young fellow is a liar as well as a cruel one; we'll just go home by farmer Bushby's, Beauty, and then if anybody wants to know, you and I can tell 'em, ye see.”So we turned off to the right, and soon came up to the stack yard and within sight of the house. The farmer was hurrying out into the road, and his wife was standing at the gate, looking very frightened.

“Have you seen my boy?”said Mr. Bushby, as we came up,“he went out an hour ago on my black pony, and the creature is just come back without a rider.”

“I should think, sir,”said John,“he had better be without a rider, unless he can be ridden properly.”

“What do you mean?”said the farmer.

“Well, sir, I saw your son whipping, and kicking, and knocking that good little pony about shamefully because he would not leap a gate that was too high for him. The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels, and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out; but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so. There's no bones broken, sir, he'll only get a few scratches. I love horses, and it riles me to see them badly used; it is a bad plan to aggravate an animal till he uses his heels; the first time is not always the last.”

During this time the mother began to cry,“Oh! my poor Bill, I must go and meet him, he must be hurt.”

“You had better go into the house, wife,”said the farmer.“Bill wants a lesson about this, and I must see that he gets it; this is not the first time nor the second that he has ill-used that pony, and I shall stop it. I am much obliged to you, Manly. Good-evening.”

So we went on, John chuckling all the way home, then he told James about it, who laughed and said,“Serve him right. I knew that boy at school; he took great airs on himself because he was a farmer's son; he used to swagger about and bully the little boys; of course we elder ones would not have any of that nonsense, and let him know that in the school and the playground, farmers' sons and laborers' sons were all alike. I well remember one day, just before afternoon school, I found him at the large window catching fiies and pulling off their wings. He did not see me, and I gave him a box on the ears that laid him sprawling on the fioor. Well, angry as I was, I was almost frightened, he roared and bellowed in such a style. The boys rushed in from the playground, and the master ran in from the road to see who was being murdered. Of course I said fair and square at once what I had done, and why; then I showed the master the fiies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week. Then he talked to all the boys very seriously about cruelty, and said how hard-hearted and cowardly it was to hurt the weak and the helpless; but what stuck in my mind was this, he said that cruelty was the devil's own trade mark, and if we saw any one who took pleasure in cruelty, we might know who he belonged to, for the devil was a murderer from the beginning, and a tormentor to the end. On the other hand, where we saw people who loved their neighbors, and were kind to man and beast, we might know that was God's mark.”

“Your master never taught you a truer thing,”said John;“there is no religion without love, and people may talk as much as they like about their religion, but if it does not teach them to be good and kind to man and beast, it is all a sham—all a sham, James, and it won't stand when things come to be turned inside out and put down for what they are.”





14　James Howard


One morning early in December, John had just led me into my box after my daily exercise, and was strapping my cloth on, and James was coming in from the corn chamber with some oats, when the master came into the stable; he looked rather serious, and held an open letter in his hand. John fastened the door of my box, touched his cap, and waited for orders.

“Good morning, John,”said the master.“I want to know if you have any complaint to make of James.”

“Complaint, sir? No, sir.”

“Is he industrious at his work and respectful to you?”“Yes, sir, always.”

“You never find he slights his work when your back is turned?”

“Never, sir.”

“That's well; but I must put another question; have you any reason to suspect that when he goes out with the horses to exercise them, or to take a message, he stops about talking to his acquaintances, or goes into houses where he has no business, leaving the horses outside?”

“No, sir, certainly not, and if anybody has been saying that about James, I don't believe it, and I don't mean to believe it unless I have it fairly proved before witnesses; it's not for me to say who has been trying to take away James' character, but I will say this, sir, that a steadier, pleasanter, honester, smarter young fellow I never had in this stable. I can trust his word and I can trust his work; he is gentle and clever with the horses, and I would rather have them in his charge than in that of half the young fellows I know in laced hats and liveries; and whoever wants a character of James Howard,”said John, with a decided jerk of his head,“let them come to John Manly.”

The master stood all this time grave and attentive, but as John finished his speech a broad smile spread over his face, and looking kindly across at James, who all this time had stood still at the door, he said;“James, my lad, set down the oats and come here; I am very glad to find that John's opinion of your character agrees so exactly with my own. John is a cautious man,”he said, with a droll smile,“and it is not always easy to get his opinion about people, so I thought if I beat the bush on this side, the birds would fly out, and I should learn what I wanted to know quickly; so now we will come to business. I have a letter from my brother-in-law, Sir Clifford Williams, of Clifford Hall; he wants me to find him a trustworthy young groom, about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman, who has lived with him thirty years, is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place. He would have eighteen shillings a week at first, a stable suit, a driving suit, a bedroom over the coach-house, and a boy under him. Sir Clifford is a good master, and if you could get the place, it would be a good start for you. I don't want to part with you, and if you left us I know John would lose his right hand.”

“That I should, sir,”said John,“but I would not stand in his light for the world.”

“How old are you, James?”said master.

“Nineteen next May, sir.”

“That's young; what do you think, John?”

“Well, sir, it is young; but he is as steady as a man, and is strong, and well grown, and though he has not had much experience in driving, he has a light firm hand, and a quick eye, and he is very careful, and I am quite sure no horse of his will be ruined for want of having his feet and shoes looked after.”

“Your word will go the furthest, John,”said the master,“for Sir Clifford adds in a postscript, ‘If I could find a man trained by your John, I should like him better than any other;’ so, James, lad, think it over, talk to your mother at dinner time, and then let me know what you wish.”

In a few days after this conversation, it was fully settled that James should go to Clifford Hall in a month or six weeks, as it suited his master, and in the meantime he was to get all the practice in driving that could be given to him. I never knew the carriage to go out so often before; when the mistress did not go out, the master drove himself in the two-wheeled chaise; but now, whether it was master or the young ladies, or only an errand, Ginger and I were put into the carriage and James drove us. At the first, John rode with him on the box, telling him this and that, and after that James drove alone.

Then it was wonderful what a number of places the master would go to in the city on Saturday, and what queer streets we were driven through. He was sure to go to the railway station just as the train was coming in, and cabs and carriages, carts and omnibuses were all trying to get over the bridge together; that bridge wanted good horses and good drivers when the railway bell was ringing, for it was narrow, and there was a very sharp turn up to the station, where it would not have been at all difficult for people to run into each other, if they did not look sharp and keep their wits about them.





15　The Old Hostler


After this it was decided by my master and mistress to pay a visit to some friends who lived about forty-six miles from our home, and James was to drive them. The first day we traveled thirty-two miles; there were some long, heavy hills, but James drove so carefully and thoughtfully that we were not at all harassed. He never forgot to put on the drag as we went downhill, nor to take it off at the right place. He kept our feet on the smoothest part of the road, and if the uphill was very long, he set the carriage wheels a little across the road, so as not to run back, and gave us a breathing. All these little things help a horse very much, particularly if he gets kind words into the bargain.

We stopped once or twice on the road, and just as the sun was going down we reached the town where we were to spend the night. We stopped at the principal hotel, which was in the Market Place; it was a very large one; we drove under an archway into a long yard, at the further end of which were the stables and coach-houses. Two hostlers came to take us out. The head hostler was a pleasant, active little man, with a crooked leg, and a yellow striped waistcoat. I never saw a man unbuckle harness so quickly as he did, and with a pat and a good word he led me to a long stable, with six or eight stalls in it, and two or three horses. The other man brought Ginger; James stood by while we were rubbed down and cleaned.

I never was cleaned so lightly and quickly as by that little old man. When he had done, James stepped up and felt me over, as if he thought I could not be thoroughly done, but he found my coat as clean and smooth as silk.

“Well,”he said,“I thought I was pretty quick, and our John quicker still, but you do beat all I ever saw for being quick and thorough at the same time.”

“Practice makes perfect,”said the crooked little hostler,“and 'twould be a pity if it didn't; forty years' practice, and not perfect! ha, ha! that would be a pity; and as to being quick, why, bless you! that is only a matter of habit; if you get into the habit of being quick, it is just as easy as being slow; easier, I should say; in fact, it don't agree with my health to be hulking about over a job twice as long as it need take. Bless you! I couldn't whistle if I crawled over my work as some folks do! You see, I have been about horses ever since I was twelve years old, in hunting stables, and racing stables; and being small, ye see, I was jockey for several years; but at the Goodwood, ye see, the turf was very slippery and my poor Larkspur got a fall, and I broke my knee, and so of course I was of no more use there; but I could not live without horses, of course I couldn't, so I took to the hotels, and I can tell ye it is a downright pleasure to handle an animal like this, well-bred, well-mannered, well-cared-for; bless ye! I can tell how a horse is treated. Give me the handling of a horse for twenty minutes, and I'll tell you what sort of a groom he has had; look at this one, pleasant, quiet, turns about just as you want him, holds up his feet to be cleaned out, or anything else you please to wish; then you'll find another, fidgety, fretty, won't move the right way, or starts across the stall, tosses up his head as soon as you come near him, lays his ears, and seems afraid of you; or else squares about at you with his heels! Poor things! I know what sort of treatment they have had. If they are timid, it makes them start or shy; if they are high-mettled, it makes them vicious or dangerous; their tempers are mostly made when they are young. Bless you! they are like children, train 'em up in the way they should go, as the good book says, and when they are old they will not depart from it, if they have a chance.”

“I like to hear you talk,”said James,“that's the way we lay it down at home, at our master's.”

“Who is your master, young man? if it be a proper question. I should judge he is a good one, from what I see.”

“He is Squire Gordon, of Birtwick Park, the other side the Beacon Hills,”said James.

“Ah! so, so, I have heard tell of him; fine judge of horses, ain't he? the best rider in the county.”

“I believe he is,”said James,“but he rides very little now, since the poor young master was killed.”

“Ah! poor gentleman; I read all about it in the paper at the time; a fine horse killed too, wasn't there?”

“Yes,”said James,“he was a splendid creature, brother to this one, and just like him.”

“Pity! pity!”said the old man,“'twas a bad place to leap, if I remember; a thin fence at top, a steep bank down to the stream, wasn't it? No chance for a horse to see where he is going. Now, I am for bold riding as much as any man, but still there are some leaps that only a very knowing old huntsman has any right to take; a man's life and a horse's life are worth more than a fox's tail, at least, I should say they ought to be.”

During this time the other man had finished Ginger, and had brought our corn, and James and the old man left the stable together.





16　The Fire


Later on in the evening, a traveler's horse was brought in by the second hostler, and while he was cleaning him, a young man with a pipe in his mouth lounged into the stable to gossip.

“I say, Towler,”said the hostler,“just run up the ladder into the loft and put some hay down into this horse's rack, will you? only lay down your pipe.”

“All right,”said the other, and went up through the trap door; and I heard him step across the fioor overhead and put down the hay. James came in to look at us the last thing, and then the door was locked.

I cannot say how long I had slept, nor what time in the night it was, but I woke up very uncomfortable, though I hardly knew why. I got up, the air seemed all thick and choking. I heard Ginger coughing and one of the other horses seemed very restless; it was quite dark, and I could see nothing, but the stable seemed full of smoke, and I hardly knew how to breathe.

The trap door had been left open, and I thought that was the place it came through. I listened and heard a soft rushing sort of noise, and a low crackling and snapping. I did not know what it was, but there was something in the sound so strange that it made me tremble all over. The other horses were all awake; some were pulling at their halters, others were stamping.

At last I heard steps outside, and the hostler who had put up the traveler's horse burst into the stable with a lantern, and began to untie the horses, and try to lead them out; but he seemed in such a hurry, and so frightened himself that he frightened me still more. The first horse would not go with him; he tried the second and third, they too would not stir. He came to me next and tried to drag me out of the stall by force; of course that was no use. He tried us all by turns and then left the stable.

No doubt we were very foolish, but danger seemed to be all round, and there was nobody we knew to trust in, and all was strange and uncertain. The fresh air that had come in through the open door made it easier to breathe, but the rushing sound overhead grew louder, and as I looked upward, through the bars of my empty rack I saw a red light fiickering on the wall. Then I heard a cry of“Fire”outside, and the old hostler quietly and quickly came in; he got one horse out, and went to another, but the fiames were playing round the trap door, and the roaring overhead was dreadful.

The next thing I heard was James' voice, quiet and cheery, as it always was.

“Come, my beauties, it is time for us to be off, so wake up and come along.”I stood nearest the door, so he came to me first, patting me as he came in.

“Come, Beauty, on with your bridle, my boy, we'll soon be out of this smother.”It was on in no time; then he took the scarf off his neck, and tied it lightly over my eyes, and patting and coaxing he led me out of the stable. Safe in the yard, he slipped the scarf off my eyes, and shouted,“Here somebody! take this horse while I go back for the other.”

A tall, broad man stepped forward and took me, and James darted back into the stable. I set up a shrill whinny as I saw him go. Ginger told me afterwards that whinny was the best thing I could have done for her, for had she not heard me outside, she would never have had courage to come out.

There was much confusion in the yard; the horses being got out of other stables, and the carriages and gigs being pulled out of houses and sheds, lest the fiames should spread further. On the other side of the yard, windows were thrown up, and people were shouting all sorts of things; but I kept my eye fixed on the stable door, where the smoke poured out thicker than ever, and I could see fiashes of red light; presently I heard above all the stir and din a loud, clear voice, which I knew was master's:

“James Howard! James Howard! Are you there?”There was no answer, but I heard a crash of something falling in the stable, and the next moment I gave a loud, joyful neigh, for I saw James coming through the smoke leading Ginger with him; she was coughing violently, and he was not able to speak.

“My brave lad!”said master, laying his hand on his shoulder,“are you hurt?”

James shook his head, for he could not yet speak.

“Aye,”said the big man who held me,“he is a brave lad, and no mistake.”

“And now,”said master,“when you have got your breath, James, we'll get out of this place as quickly as we can,”and we were moving towards the entry, when from the Market Place there came a sound of galloping feet and loud rumbling wheels.

“'tis the fire engine! the fire engine!”shouted two or three voices,“stand back, make way!”and clattering and thundering over the stones two horses dashed into the yard with a heavy engine behind them. The firemen leaped to the ground; there was no need to ask where the fire was—it was rolling up in a great blaze from the roof.

We got out as fast as we could into the broad quiet Market Place; the stars were shining, and except the noise behind us, all was still. Master led the way to a large hotel on the other side, and as soon as the hostler came, he said,“James, I must now hasten to your mistress; I trust the horses entirely to you, order whatever you think is needed,”and with that he was gone. The master did not run, but I never saw mortal man walk so fast as he did that night.

There was a dreadful sound before we got into our stalls; the shrieks of those poor horses that were left burning to death in the stable—it was very terrible! and made both Ginger and me feel very bad. We, however, were taken in and well done by.

The next morning the master came to see how we were and to speak to James. I did not hear much, for the hostler was rubbing me down, but I could see that James looked very happy, and I thought the master was proud of him. Our mistress had been so much alarmed in the night that the journey was put off till the afternoon, so James had the morning on hand, and went first to the inn to see about our harness and the carriage, and then to hear more about the fire. When he came back we heard him tell the hostler about it. At first no one could guess how the fire had been caused, but at last a man said he saw Dick Towler go into the stable with a pipe in his mouth, and when he came out he had not one, and went to the tap for another. Then the under hostler said he had asked Dick to go up the ladder to put down some hay, but told him to lay down his pipe first. Dick denied taking the pipe with him, but no one believed him. I remember our John Manly's rule, never to allow a pipe in the stable, and thought it ought to be the rule everywhere.

James said the roof and fioor had all fallen in, and that only the black walls were standing; the two poor horses that could not be got out were buried under the burnt rafters and tiles.





17　John Manly's Talk


The rest of our journey was very easy, and a little after sunset we reached the house of my master's friend. We were taken into a clean, snug stable; there was a kind coachman, who made us very comfortable, and who seemed to think a good deal of James when he heard about the fire.

“There is one thing quite clear, young man,”he said,“your horses know who they can trust; it is one of the hardest things in the world to get horses out of a stable when there is either fire or fiood. I don't know why they won't come out, but they won't—not one in twenty.”

We stopped two or three days at this place and then returned home. All went well on the journey; we were glad to be in our own stable again, and John was equally glad to see us.

Before he and James left us for the night, James said,“I wonder who is coming in my place.”

“Little Joe Green at the Lodge,”said John.

“Little Joe Green! why, he's a child!”

“He is fourteen and a half,”said John.

“But he is such a little chap!”

“Yes, he is small, but he is quick, and willing, and kind-hearted too, and then he wishes very much to come, and his father would like it; and I know the master would like to give him the chance. He said, if I thought he would not do, he would look out for a bigger boy; but I said I was quite agreeable to try him for six weeks.”

“Six weeks!”said James;“why, it will be six months before he can be of much use! It will make you a deal of work, John.”

“Well,”said John with a laugh,“work and I are very good friends; I never was afraid of work yet.”

“You are a very good man,”said James.“I wish I may ever be like you.”

“I don't often speak of myself,”said John,“but as you are going away from us out into the world, to shift for yourself, I'll just tell you how I look on these things. I was just as old as Joseph when my father and mother died of the fever, within ten days of each other, and left me and my cripple sister Nelly alone in the world, without a relation that we could look to for help. I was a farmer's boy, not earning enough to keep myself, much less both of us, and she must have gone to the workhouse, but for our mistress (Nelly calls her her angel, and she has good right to do so). She went and hired a room for her with old Widow Mallet, and she gave her knitting and needlework, when she was able to do it; and when she was ill, she sent her dinners and many nice, comfortable things, and was like a mother to her. Then the master, he took me into the stable under old Norman, the coachman that was then. I had my food at the house, and my bed in the loft, and a suit of clothes and three shillings a week, so that I could help Nelly. Then there was Norman; he might have turned round and said that at his age he could not be troubled with a raw boy from the plow-tail, but he was rather like a father to me, and took no end of pains with me. When the old man died some years after, I stepped into his place, and now of course I have top wages, and can lay by for a rainy day or a sunny day as it may happen, and Nelly is as happy as a bird. So you see, James, I am not the man that should turn up his nose at a little boy, and vex a good, kind master. No! no! I shall miss you very much, James, but we shall pull through, and there's nothing like doing a kindness when 'tis put in your way, and I am glad I can do it.”

“Then,”said James,“you don't hold with that saying, ‘Everybody look after himself, and take care of number one.’?”

“No, indeed,”said John,“where should I and Nelly have been if master and mistress and old Norman had only taken care of number one? Why—she in the workhouse and I hoeing turnips! Where would Black Beauty and Ginger have been if you had only thought of number one? why, roasted to death! No, Jim, no! that is a selfish, heathenish saying, whoever uses it, and any man who thinks he has nothing to do but take care of number one, why, it's a pity but what he had been drowned like a puppy or a kitten, before he got his eyes open, that's what I think,”said John, with a very decided jerk of his head.

James laughed at this; but there was a thickness in his voice when he said,“You have been my best friend except my mother; I hope you won't forget me.”

“No, lad, no!”said John,“and if ever I can do you a good turn I hope you won't forget me.”

The next day Joe came to the stables to learn all he could before James left. He learned to sweep the stable, to bring in the straw and hay; he began to clean the harness, and helped to wash the carriage. As he was quite too short to do anything in the way of grooming Ginger and me, James taught him upon Merrylegs, for he was to have full charge of him; under John. He was a nice little bright fellow, and always came whistling to his work.

Merrylegs was a good deal put out at being“mauled about,”as he said,“by a boy who knew nothing,”but towards the end of the second week he told me confidentially that he thought the boy would turn out well.

At last the day came when James had to leave us; cheerful as he always was, he looked quite down-hearted that morning.

“You see,”he said to John,“I am leaving a great deal behind; my mother and Betsy, and you, and a good master and mistress, and then the horses, and my old Merrylegs. At the new place, there will not be a soul that I shall know. If it were not that I shall get a higher place, and be able to help my mother better, I don't think I should have made up my mind to it; it is a real pinch, John.”

“Aye, James, lad, so it is, but I should not think much of you if you could leave your home for the first time and not feel it. Cheer up, you'll make friends there, and if you get on well—as I am sure you will—it will be a fine thing for your mother, and she will be proud enough that you have got into such a good place as that.”

So John cheered him up, but everyone was sorry to lose James; as for Merrylegs, he pined after him for several days, and went quite off his appetite. So John took him out several mornings with a leading rein when he exercised me, and trotting and galloping by my side got up the little fellow's spirits again, and he was soon all right.

Joe's father would often come in and give a little help, as he understood the work, and Joe took a great deal of pains to learn, and John was quite encouraged about him.





18　Going for the Doctor


One night, a few days after James had left, I had eaten my hay and was lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly awoke by the stable bell ringing very loud. I heard the door of John's house open, and his feet running up to the Hall. He was back again in no time; he unlocked the stable door, and came in, calling out,“Wake up, Beauty, you must go well now, if ever you did;”and almost before I could think he had got the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head; he just ran round for his coat, and then took me at a quick trot up to the Hall door. The Squire stood there with a lamp in his hand.

“Now, John,”he said,“ride for your life, that is, for your mistress' life; there is not a moment to lose; give this note to Dr. White; give your horse a rest at the Inn, and be back as soon as you can.”

John said,“Yes, sir,”and was on my back in a minute. The gardener who lived at the lodge had heard the bell ring, and was ready with the gate open, and away we went through the Park and through the village, and down the hill till we came to the toll-gate. John called very loud and thumped upon the door; the man was soon out and fiung open the gate.

“Now,”said John,“do you keep the gate open for the Doctor; here's the money,”and off he went again.

There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John said to me,“Now, Beauty, do your best,”and so I did; I wanted no whip nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground; I don't believe that my old grandfather who won the race at Newmarket could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge, John pulled me up a little and patted my neck.“Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,”he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up, and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty, the moon was bright, it was very pleasant; we came through a village, then through a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles' run we came to the town, through the streets and into the Market Place. It was all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones—everybody was asleep. The church clock struck three as we drew up at Dr. White's door. John rang the bell twice, and then knocked at the door like thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his head out and said,“What do you want?”

“Mrs. Gordon is very ill, sir; master wants you to go at once; he thinks she will die if you cannot get there—here is a note.”

“Wait,”he said,“I will come.”

He shut the window, and was soon at the door.

“The worst of it is,”he said,“that my horse has been out all day and is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the other. What is to be done? Can I have your horse?”

“He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it if you think fit, sir.”

“All right,”he said,“I will soon be ready.”

John stood by me and stroked my neck, I was very hot. The Doctor came out with his riding whip.

“You need not take that, sir,”said John,“Black Beauty will go till he drops; Take care of him, sir, if you can, I should not like any harm to come to him.”

“No! no! John,”said the Doctor,“I hope not,”and in a minute we had left John far behind.

I will not tell about our way back; the Doctor was a heavier man than John, and not so good a rider; however, I did my very best. The man at the toll-gate had it open. When we came to the hill, the Doctor drew me up.“Now, my good fellow,”he said,“take some breath.”I was glad he did, for I was nearly spent, but that breathing helped me on, and soon we were in the Park. Joe was at the lodge gate, my master was at the Hall door, for he had heard us coming. He spoke not a word; The Doctor went into the house with him, and Joe led me to the stable. I was glad to get home, my legs shook under me, and I could only stand and pant. I had not a dry hair on my body, the water ran down my legs, and I steamed all over—Joe used to say, like a pot on the fire. Poor Joe! he was young and small, and as yet he knew very little, and his father, who would have helped him, had been sent to the next village; but I am sure he did the very best he knew. He rubbed my legs and my chest, but he did not put my warm cloth on me; he thought I was so hot I should not like it. Then he gave me a pail full of water to drink; it was cold and very good, and I drank it all; then he gave me some hay and some corn, and thinking he had done right, he went away. Soon I began to shake and tremble, and turned deadly cold, my legs ached, my loins ached, and my chest ached, and I felt sore all over. Oh! how I wished for my warm, thick cloth, as I stood and trembled. I wished for John, but he had eight miles to walk, so I lay down in my straw and tried to go to sleep. After a long while I heard John at the door; I gave a low moan, for I was in great pain. He was at my side in a moment, stooping down by me. I could not tell him how I felt; but he seemed to know it all; he covered me up with two or three warm cloths, and then ran to the house for some hot water; he made me some warm gruel, which I drank, and then I think I went to sleep.

John seemed to be very much put out. I heard him say to himself, over and over again,“Stupid boy! stupid boy! no cloth put on, and I dare say the water was cold, too; boys are no good;”but Joe was a good boy after all.

I was now very ill; a strong infiammation had attacked my lungs, and I could not draw my breath without pain. John nursed me night and day, he would get up two or three times in the night to come to me; my master, too, often came to see me.“My poor Beauty,”he said one day,“my good horse, you saved your mistress' life, Beauty! yes, you saved her life.”I was very glad to hear that, for it seems the Doctor had said if we had been a little longer it would have been too late. John told my master he never saw a horse go so fast in his life, it seemed as if the horse knew what was the matter. Of course I did, though John thought not; at least I knew as much as this, that John and I must go at the top of our speed, and that it was for the sake of the mistress.





19　Only Ignorance


I do not know how long I was ill. Mr. Bond, the horse doctor, came every day. One day he bled me; John held a pail for the blood; I felt very faint after it, and thought I should die, and I believe they all thought so too.

Ginger and Merrylegs had been moved into the other stable, so that I might be quiet, for the fever made me very quick of hearing; any little noise seemed quite loud, and I could tell every one's footstep going to and from the house. I knew all that was going on. One night John had to give me a draught; Thomas Green came in to help him. After I had taken it and John had made me as comfortable as he could, he said he should stay half-an-hour to see how the medicine settled. Thomas said he would stay with him, so they went and sat down on a bench that had been brought into Merrylegs' stall, and put down the lantern at their feet, that I might not be disturbed with the light.

For a while both men sat silent, and then Tom Green said in a low voice:

“I wish, John, you'd say a bit of a kind word to Joe; the boy is quite broken-hearted. He can't eat his meals, and he can't smile. He says he knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew, and he says, if Beauty dies, no one will ever speak to him again. It goes to my heart to hear him; I think you might give him just a word, he is not a bad boy.”

After a short pause, John said slowly,“You must not be too hard upon me, Tom. I know he meant no harm, I never said he did; I know he is not a bad boy, but you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and mistress; and to think that his life may be fiung away in this manner, is more than I can bear; but if you think I am hard on the boy, I will try to give him a good word tomorrow—that is, I mean if Beauty is better.”

“Well, John, thank you. I knew you did not wish to be too hard, and I am glad you see it was only ignorance.”

John's voice almost startled me as he answered:

“Only ignorance! only ignorance ! how can you talk about only ignorance? Don't you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness?—and which does the most mischief, heaven only knows. If people can say, ‘Oh! I did not know, I did not mean any harm,’ they think it is all right. I suppose Martha Mulwash did not mean to kill that baby, when she dosed it with Dalby, and soothing syrups; but she did kill it, and was tried for manslaughter.”

“And serve her right, too,”said Tom.“A woman should not undertake to nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad for it.”

“Bill Starkey,”continued John,“did not mean to frighten his brother into fits when he dressed up like a ghost, and ran after him in the moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that might have been the pride of any mother's heart, is just no better than an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old. You were a good deal cut up yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, when those young ladies left your hothouse door open, with a frosty east wind blowing right in; you said it killed a good many of your plants.”

“A good many!”said Tom,“there was not one of the tender cuttings that was not nipped off; I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst of it is, that I don't know where to go to get fresh ones. I was nearly mad when I came in and saw what was done.”

“And yet,”said John,“I am sure the young ladies did not mean it; it was only ignorance!”

I heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought of John's words when I came to know more of the world.





20　Joe Green


Joe Green went on very well; he learned quickly, and was so attentive and careful that John began to trust him in many things; but, as I have said, he was small of his age, and it was seldom that he was allowed to exercise either Ginger or me; but it so happened one morning that John was out with Justice in the luggage cart, and the master wanted a note to be taken immediately to a gentleman's house, about three miles distant, and sent his orders for Joe to saddle me and take it; adding the caution that he was to ride steadily.

The note was delivered, and we were quietly returning till we came to the brickfield. Here we saw a cart heavily laden with bricks; the wheels had stuck fast in the stiff mud of some deep ruts, and the carter was shouting and fiogging the two horses unmercifully. Joe pulled up. It was a sad sight. There were the two horses straining and struggling with all their might to drag the cart out, but they could not move it; the sweat streamed from their legs and fianks, their sides heaved, and every muscle was strained, while the man, fiercely pulling at the head of the forehorse, swore and lashed most brutally.

“Hold hard,”said Joe,“don't go on fiogging the horses like that; the wheels are so stuck that they cannot move the cart.”The man took no heed, but went on lashing.

“Stop! pray stop,”said Joe;“I'll help you to lighten the cart; they can't move it now.”

“Mind your own business, you impudent young rascal, and I'll mind mine.”The man was in a towering passion, and the worse for drink, and laid on the whip again. Joe turned my head, and the next moment we were going at a round gallop towards the house of the master brickmaker. I cannot say if John would have approved of our pace, but Joe and I were both of one mind, and so angry that we could not have gone slower.

The house stood close by the roadside. Joe knocked at the door and shouted,“Halloo! Is Mr. Clay at home?”The door was opened, and Mr. Clay himself came out.

“Halloo, young man! you seem in a hurry; any orders from the Squire this morning?”

“No, Mr. Clay, but there's a fellow in your brickyard fiogging two horses to death. I told him to stop, and he wouldn't; I said I'd help him to lighten the cart, and he wouldn't; so I have come to tell you. Pray, sir, go.”Joe's voice shook with excitement.

“Thank ye, my lad,”said the man, running in for his hat; then pausing for a moment,“Will you give evidence of what you saw if I should bring the fellow up before a magistrate?”

“That I will,”said Joe,“and glad too.”The man was gone, and we were on our way home at a smart trot.

“Why, what's the matter with you, Joe? You look angry all over,”said John, as the boy fiung himself from the saddle.

“I am angry all over, I can tell you,”said the boy, and then in hurried, excited words he told all that had happened. Joe was usually such a quiet, gentle little fellow that it was wonderful to see him so roused.

“Right, Joe! you did right, my boy, whether the fellow gets a summons or not. Many folks would have ridden by and said it was not their business to interfere. Now, I say that with cruelty and oppression it is everybody's business to interfere when they see it; you did right, my boy.”

Joe was quite calm by this time, and proud that John approved of him, and he cleaned out my feet, and rubbed me down with a firmer hand than usual.

They were just going home to dinner when the footman came down to the stable to say that Joe was wanted directly in master's private room; there was a man brought up for ill-using horses, and Joe's evidence was wanted. The boy fiushed up to his forehead, and his eyes sparkled.“They shall have it,”said he.

“Put yourself a bit straight,”said John. Joe gave a pull at his necktie and a twitch at his jacket, and was off in a moment. Our master being one of the county magistrates, cases were often brought to him to settle, or say what should be done. In the stable we heard no more for some time, as it was the men's dinner hour, but when Joe came next into the stable I saw he was in high spirits; he gave me a good-natured slap and said,“We won't see such things done, will we, old fellow?”We heard afterwards that he had given his evidence so clearly, and the horses were in such an exhausted state, bearing marks of such brutal usage, that the carter was committed to take his trial, and might possibly be sentenced to two or three months in prison.

It was wonderful what a change had come over Joe. John laughed, and said he had grown an inch taller in that week, and I believe he had. He was just as kind and gentle as before, but there was more purpose and determination in all that he did—as if he had jumped at once from a boy into a man.





21　The Parting


Now I had lived in this happy place three years, but sad changes were about to come over us. We heard from time to time that our mistress was ill. The Doctor was often at the house, and the master looked grave and anxious. Then we heard that she must leave her home at once, and go to a warm country for two or three years. The news fell upon the household like the tolling of a death-bell. Everybody was sorry; but the master began directly to make arrangements for breaking up his establishment and leaving England. We used to hear it talked about in our stable; indeed, nothing else was talked about.

John went about his work silent and sad, and Joe scarcely whistled. There was a great deal of coming and going; Ginger and I had full work.

The first of the party who went were Miss Jessie and Flora, with their governess. They came to bid us good-bye. They hugged poor Merrylegs like an old friend, and so indeed he was. Then we heard what had been arranged for us. Master had sold Ginger and me to his old friend, the Earl of W—, for he thought we should have a good place there. Merrylegs he had given to the Vicar, who was wanting a pony for Mrs. Blomefield, but it was on the condition that he should never be sold, and when he was past work he should be shot and buried.

Joe was engaged to take care of him, and to help in the house, so I thought that Merrylegs was well off. John had the offer of several good places, but he said he should wait a little and look round.

The evening before they left, the master came into the stable to give some directions and to give his horses the last pat. He seemed very low-spirited; I knew that by his voice. I believe we horses can tell more by the voice than many men can.

“Have you decided what to do, John?”he said.“I find you have not accepted any of those offers.”

“No, sir. I have made up my mind that if I could get a situation with some first-rate colt-breaker and horse-trainer, that it would be the right thing for me. Many young animals are frightened and spoiled by wrong treatment which need not be; if the right man took them in hand. I always get on well with horses, and if I could help some of them to a fair start, I should feel as if I was doing some good. What do you think of it, sir?”

“I don't know a man anywhere,”said master,“that I should think so suitable for it as yourself. You understand horses, and somehow they understand you, and in time you might set up for yourself; I think you could not do better. If in any way I can help you, write to me; I shall speak to my agent in London, and leave your character with him.”

Master gave John the name and address, and then he thanked him for his long and faithful service; but that was too much for John.“Pray don't, sir, I can't bear it; you and my dear mistress have done so much for me that I could never repay it; but we shall never forget you, sir, and please God we may some day see mistress back again like herself; we must keep up hope, sir.”Master gave John his hand, but he did not speak, and they both left the stable.

The last sad day had come; the footman and the heavy luggage had gone off the day before, and there were only master and mistress and her maid. Ginger and I brought the carriage up to the Hall door for the last time. The servants brought out cushions and rugs and many other things, and when all were arranged, master came down the steps carrying the mistress in his arms (I was on the side next to the house and could see all that went on); he placed her carefully in the carriage, while the house servants stood round crying.

“Good-bye, again,”he said,“we shall not forget any of you,”and he got in.“Drive on, John.”

Joe jumped up, and we trotted slowly through the Park, and through the village, where the people were standing at their doors to have a last look and to say,“God bless them.”

When we reached the railway station, I think mistress walked from the carriage to the waiting-room. I heard her say in her own sweet voice,“Good-bye, John, God bless you.”I felt the rein twitch, but John made no answer, perhaps he could not speak. As soon as Joe had taken the things out of the carriage, John called him to stand by the horses, while he went on the platform. Poor Joe! he stood close up to our heads to hide his tears. Very soon the train came puffing up into the station; then two or three minutes, and the doors were slammed to; the guard whistled and the train glided away, leaving behind it only clouds of white smoke, and some very heavy hearts.

When it was quite out of sight, John came back.

“We shall never see her again,”he said—“never.”He took the reins, mounted the box, and with Joe drove slowly home; but it was not our home now.





PART TWO





22　Earlshall


The next morning after breakfast Joe put Merrylegs into the mistress's low chaise to take him to the vicarage; he came first and said good-bye to us, and Merrylegs neighed to us from the yard. Then John put the saddle on Ginger and the leading rein on me, and rode us across the country about fifteen miles to Earlshall Park, where the Earl of W—lived. There was a very fine house and a great deal of stabling; we went into the yard through a stone gateway, and John asked for Mr. York. It was some time before he came. He was a fine-looking, middle-aged man, and his voice said at once that he expected to be obeyed. He was very friendly and polite to John, and after giving us a slight look he called a groom to take us to our boxes, and invited John to take some refreshment.

We were taken to a light, airy stable, and placed in boxes adjoining each other, where we were rubbed down and fed. In about half-an-hour John and Mr. York, who was to be our new coachman, came in to see us.

“Now, Mr. Manly,”he said, after carefully looking at us both,“I can see no fault in these horses, but we all know that horses have their peculiarities as well as men, and that sometimes they need different treatment; I should like to know if there is anything particular in either of these that you would like to mention.”

“Well,”said John,“I don't believe there is a better pair of horses in the country, and right grieved I am to part with them, but they are not alike. The black one is the most perfect temper I ever knew; I suppose he has never known a hard word or a blow since he was foaled, and all his pleasure seems to be to do what you wish; but the chestnut I fancy must have had bad treatment; we heard as much from the dealer. She came to us snappish and suspicious, but when she found what sort of place ours was, it all went off by degrees; for three years I have never seen the smallest sign of temper, and if she is well treated there is not a better, more willing animal than she is; but she is naturally a more irritable constitution than the black horse; fiies tease her more; anything wrong in the harness frets her more; and if she were ill-used or unfairly treated, she would not be unlikely to give tit for tat; you know that many high-mettled horses will do so.”

“Of course,”said York,“I quite understand, but you know it is not easy in stables like these to have all the grooms just what they should be, I do my best, and there I must leave it. I'll remember what you have said about the mare.”

They were going out of the stable when John stopped and said,“I had better mention that we have never used the bearing rein with either of them; the black horse never had one on, and the dealer said it was the gag-bit that spoiled the other's temper.”

“Well,”said York,“if they come here they must wear the bearing rein. I prefer a loose rein myself, and his lordship is always very reasonable about horses; but my lady—that's another thing—she will have style; and if her carriage horses are not reined up tight, she wouldn't look at them. I always stand out against the gag-bit, and shall do so, but it must be tight up when my lady rides!”

“I am sorry for it, very sorry,”said John,“but I must go now, or I shall lose the train.”

He came round to each of us to pat and speak to us for the last time; his voice sounded very sad.

I held my face close to him, that was all I could do to say good-bye; and then he was gone, and I have never seen him since.

The next day Lord W—came to look at us; he seemed pleased with our appearance.

“I have great confidence in these horses,”he said,“from the character my friend Mr. Gordon has given me of them. Of course they are not a match in color, but my idea is that they will do very well for the carriage while we are in the country. Before we go to London I must try to match Baron; the black horse, I believe, is perfect for riding.”

York then told him what John had said about us.

“Well,”said he,“you must keep an eye to the mare, and put the bearing rein easy; I dare say they will do very well with a little humoring at first. I'll mention it to her ladyship.”

In the afternoon we were harnessed and put in the carriage, and as the stable clock struck three we were led round to the front of the house. It was all very grand, and three or four times as large as the old house at Birtwick, but not half so pleasant, if a horse may have an opinion. Two footmen were standing ready, dressed in drab livery, with scarlet breeches and white stockings. Presently we heard the rustling sound of silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps. She stepped round to look at us; she was a tall, proud-looking woman, and did not seem pleased about something, but she said nothing, and got into the carriage. This was the first time of wearing a check-rein, and I must say, though it certainly was a nuisance not to be able to get my head down now and then, it did not pull my head higher than I was accustomed to carry it. I felt anxious about Ginger, but she seemed to be quiet and content.

The next day at three o'clock we were again at the door, and the footmen as before; we heard the silk dress rustle, and the lady came down the steps, and in an imperious voice she said,“York, you must put those horses' heads higher; they are not fit to be seen.”

York got down and said very respectfully,“I beg your pardon, my lady, but these horses have not been reined up for three years, and my lord said it would be safer to bring them to it by degrees; but if your ladyship pleases, I can take them up a little more.”

“Do so,”she said.

York came round to our heads and shortened the rein himself, one hole, I think; every little makes a difference, be it for better or worse, and that day we had a steep hill to go up. Then I began to understand what I had heard of. Of course I wanted to put my head forward and take the carriage up with a will, as we had been used to do; but no, I had to pull with my head up now, and that took all the spirit out of me, and the strain came on my back and legs. When we came in, Ginger said,“Now you see what it is like, but this is not bad, and if it does not get much worse than this, I shall say nothing about it, for we are very well treated here; but if they strain me up tight, why, let 'em look out! I can't bear it, and I won't.”

Day by day, hole by hole our bearing reins were shortened, and instead of looking forward with pleasure to having my harness put on as I used to do, I began to dread it. Ginger too seemed restless, though she said very little. At last I thought the worst was over; for several days there was no more shortening, and I determined to make the best of it and do my duty, though it was now a constant harass instead of a pleasure; but the worst was not come.





23　A Strike for Liberty


One day my lady came down later than usual, and the silk rustled more than ever.

“Drive to the Duchess of B—'s,”she said, and then after a pause,“Are you never going to get those horses' heads up, York? Raise them at once, and let us have no more of this humoring and nonsense.”

York came to me first, while the groom stood at Ginger's head. He drew my head back and fixed the rein so tight that it was almost intolerable; then he went to Ginger, who was impatiently jerking her head up and down against the bit, as was her way now. She had a good idea of what was coming, and the moment York took the rein off the terret in order to shorten it, she took her opportunity and reared up so suddenly that York had his nose roughly hit, and his hat knocked off; the groom was nearly thrown off his legs. At once they both fiew to her head, but she was a match for them, and went on plunging, rearing, and kicking in a most desperate manner; at last she kicked right over the carriage pole and fell down, after giving me a severe blow on my near quarter. There is no knowing what further mischief she might have done, had not York promptly sat himself down fiat on her head to prevent her struggling, at the same time calling out,“Unbuckle the black horse! run for the winch and unscrew the carriage pole; cut the trace here, somebody, if you can't unhitch it.”One of the footmen ran for the winch, and another brought a knife from the house. The groom soon set me free from Ginger and the carriage, and led me to my box. He just turned me in as I was and ran back to York. I was much excited by what had happened, and if I had ever been used to kick or rear, I am sure I should have done it then; but I never had, and there I stood angry, sore in my leg, my head still strained up to the terret on the saddle, and no power to get it down. I was very miserable, and felt much inclined to kick the first person who came near me.

Before long, however, Ginger was led in by two grooms, a good deal knocked about and bruised. York came with her and gave his orders, and then came to look at me. In a moment he let down my head.

“Confound these bearing reins!”he said to himself;“I thought we should have some mischief soon—master will be sorely vexed; but there—if a woman's husband can't rule her, of course a servant can't; so I wash my hands of it, and if she can't get to the Duchess' garden party, I can't help it.”

York did not say this before the men; he always spoke respectfully when they were by. Now, he felt me all over, and soon found the place above my hock where I had been kicked. It was swelled and painful; he ordered it to be sponged with hot water, and then some lotion was put on.

Lord W—was much put out when he learned what had happened; he blamed York for giving way to his mistress, to which he replied that in future he would much prefer to receive his orders only from his lordship; but I think nothing came of it, for things went on the same as before. I thought York might have stood up better for his horses, but perhaps I am no judge.

Ginger was never put into the carriage again, but when she was well of her bruises, one of the Lord W—'s younger sons said he should like to have her; he was sure she would make a good hunter. As for me, I was obliged still to go in the carriage, and had a fresh partner called Max; he had always been used to the tight rein. I asked him how it was he bore it.

“Well,”he said,“I bear it because I must, but it is shortening my life, and it will shorten yours too, if you have to stick to it.”

“Do you think,”I said,“that our masters know how bad it is for us?”

“I can't say,”he replied,“but the dealers and the horse doctors know it very well. I was at a dealer's once, who was training me and another horse to go as a pair; he was getting our heads up, as he said, a little higher and a little higher every day. A gentleman who was there asked him why he did so; ‘Because,’ said he, ‘people won't buy them unless we do. The London people always want their horses to carry their heads high, and to step high; of course it is very bad for the horses, but then it is good for trade. The horses soon wear up, or get diseased, and they come for another pair.’ That,”said Max,“is what he said in my hearing, and you can judge for yourself.”

What I suffered with that rein for four long months in my lady's carriage, it would be hard to describe; but I am quite sure that, had it lasted much longer, either my health or my temper would have given way. Before that, I never knew what it was to foam at the mouth, but now the action of the sharp bit on my tongue and jaw, and the constrained position of my head and throat always caused me to froth at the mouth more or less. Some people think it very fine to see this, and say,“What fine, spirited creatures!”But it is just as unnatural for horses as for men to foam at the mouth; it is a sure sign of some discomfort, and should be attended to. Besides this, there was a pressure on my windpipe, which often made my breathing very uncomfortable; when I returned from my work, my neck and chest were strained and painful, my mouth and tongue tender, and I felt worn and depressed.

In my old home I always knew that John and my master were my friends; but here, although in many ways I was well treated, I had no friend. York might have known, and very likely did know, how that rein harassed me; but I suppose he took it as a matter of course that it could not be helped; at any rate, nothing was done to relieve me.





24　The Lady Anne


Early in the spring, Lord W—and part of his family went up to London, and took York with them. I and Ginger and some other horses were left at home for use, and the head groom was left in charge.

The Lady Harriet, who remained at the Hall, was a great invalid, and never went out in the carriage, and the Lady Anne preferred riding on horseback with her brother, or cousins. She was a perfect horsewoman, and as gay and gentle as she was beautiful. She chose me for her horse, and named me“Black Auster.”I enjoyed these rides very much in the clear cold air, sometimes with Ginger, sometimes with Lizzie. This Lizzie was a bright bay mare, almost thoroughbred, and a great favorite with the gentlemen, on account of her fine action and lively spirit; but Ginger, who knew more of her than I did, told me she was rather nervous.

There was a gentleman of the name of Blantyre staying at the Hall; he always rode Lizzie, and praised her so much that one day Lady Anne ordered the side-saddle to be put on her, and the other saddle on me. When we came to the door, the gentleman seemed very uneasy.

“How is this?”he said.“Are you tired of your good Black Auster?”

“Oh! no, not at all,”she replied,“but I am amiable enough to let you ride him for once, and I will try your charming Lizzie. You must confess that in size and appearance she is far more like a lady's horse than my own favorite.”

“Do let me advise you not to mount her,”he said,“she is a charming creature, but she is too nervous for a lady. I assure you she is not perfectly safe; let me beg you to have the saddles changed.”

“My dear cousin,”said Lady Anne, laughing,“pray do not trouble your good careful head about me; I have been a horsewoman ever since I was a baby, and I have followed the hounds a great many times, though I know you do not approve of ladies hunting; but still that is the fact, and I intend to try this Lizzie that you gentlemen are all so fond of; so please help me to mount like a good friend as you are.”

There was no more to be said; he placed her carefully on the saddle, looked to the bit and curb, gave the reins gently into her hand, and then mounted me. Just as we were moving off, a footman came out with a slip of paper and message from the Lady Harriet—“Would they ask this question for her at Dr. Ashley's, and bring the answer?”

The village was about a mile off, and the Doctor's house was the last in it. We went along gaily enough till we came to his gate. There was a short drive up to the house between tall evergreens.

Blantyre alighted at the gate, and was going to open it for Lady Anne, but she said,“I will wait for you here, and you can hang Auster's rein on the gate.”

He looked at her doubtfully—“I will not be five minutes,”he said.

“Oh, do not hurry yourself. Lizzie and I shall not run away from you.”

He hung my rein on one of the iron spikes, and was soon hidden among the trees. Lizzie was standing quietly by the side of the road a few paces off with her back to me. My young mistress was sitting easily with a loose rein, humming a little song. I listened to my rider's footsteps until they reached the house, and heard him knock at the door. There was a meadow on the opposite side of the road, the gate of which stood open. Just then some cart horses and several young colts came trotting out in a very disorderly manner, while a boy behind was cracking a great whip. The colts were wild and frolicsome, and one of them bolted across the road, and blundered up against Lizzie's hind legs; and whether it was the stupid colt, or the loud cracking of the whip, or both together, I cannot say, but she gave a violent kick, and dashed off into a headlong gallop. It was so sudden that Lady Anne was nearly unseated, but she soon recovered herself. I gave a loud, shrill neigh for help; again and again I neighed, pawing the ground impatiently, and tossing my head to get the rein loose. I had not long to wait, Blantyre came running to the gate; he looked anxiously about, and just caught sight of the fiying figure, now far away on the road. In an instant he sprang to the saddle. I needed no whip, or spur, for I was as eager as my rider; he saw it, and giving me a free rein, and leaning a little forward, we dashed after them.

For about a mile and a half the road ran straight, and then bent to the right, after which it divided into two roads. Long before we came to the bend, she was out of sight. Which way had she turned? A woman was standing at her garden gate, shading her eyes with her hand, and looking eagerly up the road. Scarcely drawing the rein, Blantyre shouted,“Which way?”“To the right,”cried the woman, pointing with her hand, and away we went up the right-hand road; then for a moment we caught sight of her; another bend and she was hidden again. Several times we caught glimpses, and then lost them. We scarcely seemed to gain ground upon them at all. An old road-mender was standing near a heap of stones—his shovel dropped, and his hands raised. As we came near he made a sign to speak. Blantyre drew the rein a little.“To the common, to the common, sir; she has turned off there.”I knew this common very well; it was for the most part very uneven ground, covered with heather and dark green furze bushes, with here and there a scrubby old thorn-tree; there were also open spaces of fine short grass, with ant-hills and mole turns everywhere; the worst place I ever knew for a headlong gallop.

We had hardly turned on the common, when we caught sight again of the green habit fiying on before us. My lady's hat was gone, and her long brown hair was streaming behind her. Her head and body were thrown back, as if she were pulling with all her remaining strength, and as if that strength were nearly exhausted. It was clear that the roughness of the ground had very much lessened Lizzie's speed, and there seemed a chance that we might overtake her.

While we were on the high road, Blantyre had given me my head; but now, with a light hand and a practiced eye, he guided me over the ground in such a masterly manner, that my pace was scarcely slackened, and we were decidedly gaining on them.

About halfway across the heath there had been a wide dyke recently cut, and the earth from the cutting was cast up roughly on the other side. Surely this would stop them! but no; with scarcely a pause Lizzie took the leap, stumbled among the rough clods, and fell. Blantyre groaned,“Now, Auster, do your best!”He gave me a steady rein. I gathered myself well together, and with one determined leap cleared both dyke and bank.

Motionless among the heather, with her face to the earth, lay my poor young mistress. Blantyre kneeled down and called her name: there was no sound; gently he turned her face upward, it was ghastly white, and the eyes were closed.“Annie, dear Annie, do speak!”but there was no answer. He unbuttoned her habit, loosened her collar, felt her hands and wrists, then started up and looked wildly round him for help.

At no great distance there were two men cutting turf, who, seeing Lizzie running wild without a rider had left their work to catch her.

Blantyre's Halloo soon brought them to the spot. The foremost man seemed much troubled at the sight, and asked what he could do.

“Can you ride?”

“Well, sir, I bean't much of a horseman, but I'd risk my neck for the Lady Anne; she was uncommon good to my wife in the winter.”

“Then mount this horse, my friend; your neck will be quite safe, and ride to the Doctor's and ask him to come instantly—then on to the Hall—tell them all that you know, and bid them send me the carriage with Lady Anne's maid and help. I shall stay here.”

“All right, sir, I'll do my best, and I pray God the dear young lady may open her eyes soon.”Then, seeing the other man, he called out,“Here, Joe, run for some water, and tell my missus to come as quick as she can to the Lady Anne.”

He then somehow scrambled into the saddle, and with a“Gee-up”and a clap on my sides with both his legs, he started on his journey, making a little circuit to avoid the dyke. He had no whip, which seemed to trouble him, but my pace soon cured that difficulty, and he found the best thing he could do was to stick to the saddle, and hold me in, which he did manfully. I shook him as little as I could help, but once or twice on the rough ground he called out,“Steady! Woa! Steady!”On the high road we were all right; and at the Doctor's and the Hall he did his errand like a good man and true. They asked him in to take a drop of something.“No! no,”he said;“I'll be back to 'em again by a short cut through the fields, and be there afore the carriage.”

There was a great deal of hurry and excitement after the news became known. I was just turned into my box, the saddle and the bridle were taken off, and a cloth thrown over me.

Ginger was saddled and sent off in great haste for Lord George, and I soon heard the carriage roll out of the yard.

It seemed a long time before Ginger came back and before we were left alone; and then she told me all that she had seen.

“I can't tell much,”she said;“We went a gallop nearly all the way, and got there just as the Doctor rode up. There was a woman sitting on the ground with the lady's head in her lap. The Doctor poured something into her mouth, but all that I heard was, ‘she is not dead.’ Then I was led off by a man to a little distance. After a while she was taken to the carriage, and we came home together. I heard my master say to a gentleman who stopped him to inquire, that he hoped no bones were broken, but that she had not spoken yet.”

When Lord George took Ginger for hunting, York shook his head; he said it ought to be a steady hand to train a horse for the first season, and not a random rider like Lord George.

Ginger used to like it very much, but sometimes when she came back I could see that she had been very much strained, and now and then she gave a short cough. She had too much spirit to complain, but I could not help feeling anxious about her.

Two days after the accident, Blantyre paid me a visit; he patted me and praised me very much, he told Lord George that he was sure the horse knew of Annie's danger as well as he did.“I could not have held him in if I would,”said he;“she ought never to ride any other horse.”I found by their conversation that my young mistress was now out of danger, and would soon be able to ride again. This was good news to me, and I looked forward to a happy life.





25　Reuben Smith


Now I must say a little about Reuben Smith, who was left in charge of the stables when York went to London. No one more thoroughly understood his business than he did, and when he was all right, there could not be a more faithful or valuable man. He was gentle and very clever in his management of horses, and could doctor them almost as well as a farrier, for he had lived two years with a veterinary surgeon. He was a first-rate driver; he could take a four-in-hand, or a tandem, as easily as a pair. He was a handsome man, a good scholar, and had very pleasant manners. I believe everybody liked him; certainly the horses did; the only wonder was that he should be in an under situation, and not in the place of a head coachman like York; but he had one great fault, and that was the love of drink. He was not like some men, always at it; he used to keep steady for weeks or months together; and then he would break out and have a“bout”of it, as York called it, and be a disgrace to himself, a terror to his wife, and a nuisance to all that had to do with him. He was, however, so useful, that two or three times York had hushed the matter up, and kept it from the Earl's knowledge; but one night, when Reuben had to drive a party home from a ball, he was so drunk that he could not hold the reins, and a gentleman of the party had to mount the box and drive the ladies home. Of course this could not be hidden, and Reuben was at once dismissed; his poor wife and little children had to turn out of the pretty cottage by the Park gate and go where they could. Old Max told me all this, for it happened a good while ago; but shortly before Ginger and I came Smith had been taken back again. York had interceded for him with the Earl, who is very kind-hearted, and the man had promised faithfully that he would never taste another drop as long as he lived there. He had kept his promise so well that York thought he might be safely trusted to fill his place whilst he was away, and he was so clever and honest that no one else seemed so well fitted for it.

It was now early in April, and the family was expected home some time in May. The light brougham was to be freshly done up, and as Colonel Blantyre was obliged to return to his regiment, it was arranged that Smith should drive him to the town in it, and ride back; for this purpose, he took the saddle with him, and I was chosen for the journey. At the station the Colonel put some money into Smith's hand and bid him good-bye, saying,“Take care of your young mistress, Reuben, and don't let Black Auster be hacked about by any random young prig that wants to ride him—keep him for the lady.”

We left the carriage at the maker's, and Smith rode me to the White Lion, and ordered the hostler to feed me well and have me ready for him at four o'clock. A nail in one of my front shoes had started as I came along, but the hostler did not notice it till just about four o'clock. Smith did not come into the yard till five, and then he said he should not leave till six, as he had met with some old friends. The man then told him of the nail, and asked if he should have the shoe looked to.

“No,”said Smith,“that will be all right till we get home.”

He spoke in a very loud off-hand way, and I thought it very unlike him, not to see about the shoe, as he was generally wonderfully particular about loose nails in our shoes. He did not come at six, nor seven, nor eight, and it was nearly nine o'clock before he called for me, and then it was in a loud, rough voice. He seemed in a very bad temper, and abused the hostler, though I could not tell what for.

The landlord stood at the door and said,“Have a care, Mr. Smith!”but he answered angrily with an oath; and almost before he was out of the town he began to gallop, frequently giving me a sharp cut with his whip, though I was going at full speed. The moon had not yet risen, and it was very dark. The roads were stony, having been recently mended; going over them at this pace, my shoe became looser and when we were near the turnpike gate it came off.

If Smith had been in his right senses, he would have been sensible of something wrong in my pace; but he was too madly drunk to notice anything.

Beyond the turnpike was a long piece of road, upon which fresh stones had just been laid; large sharp stones, over which no horse could be driven quickly without risk of danger. Over this road, with one shoe gone, I was forced to gallop at my utmost speed, my rider meanwhile cutting into me with his whip, and with wild curses urging me to go still faster. Of course my shoeless foot suffered dreadfully; the hoof was broken and split down to the very quick, and the inside was terribly cut by the sharpness of the stones.

This could not go on; no horse could keep his footing under such circumstances; the pain was too great. I stumbled, and fell with violence on both my knees. Smith was flung off by my fall, and owing to the speed I was going at, he must have fallen with great force. I soon recovered my feet and limped to the side of the road, where it was free from stones. The moon had just risen above the hedge, and by its light I could see Smith lying a few yards beyond me. He did not rise, he made one slight effort to do so, and then there was a heavy groan. I could have groaned too, for I was suffering intense pain both from my foot and knees; but horses are used to bear their pain in silence. I uttered no sound, but I stood there and listened. One more heavy groan from Smith; but though he now lay in the full moonlight I could see no motion. I could do nothing for him nor myself, but, oh! how I listened for the sound of horse, or wheels, or footsteps. The road was not much frequented, and at this time of the night we might stay for hours before help came to us. I stood watching and listening. It was a calm sweet April night; there were no sounds but a few low notes of a nightingale, and nothing moved but the white clouds near the moon and a brown owl that fiitted over the hedge. It made me think of the summer nights long ago, when I used to lie beside my mother in the green pleasant meadow at Farmer Grey's.





26　How It Ended


It must have been nearly midnight when I heard at a great distance the sound of a horse's feet. Sometimes the sound died away, then it grew clearer again and nearer. The road to Earlshall led through plantations that belonged to the Earl: the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it might be someone coming in search of us. As the sound came nearer and nearer, I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; a little nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog-cart. I neighed loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's voices. They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground.

One of the men jumped out, and stooped down over it.“It is Reuben,”he said,“and he does not stir.”

The other man followed, and bent over him.“He's dead,”he said;“feel how cold his hands are.”

They raised him up, but there was no life, and his hair was soaked with blood. They laid him down again, and came and looked at me. They soon saw my cut knees.

“Why, the horse has been down and thrown him! Who would have thought the black horse would have done that? Nobody thought he could fall. Reuben must have been lying here for hours! Odd, too, that the horse has not moved from the place.”

Robert then attempted to lead me forward. I made a step, but almost fell again.

“Hallo! he's bad in his foot as well as his knees; look here—his hoof is cut all to pieces, he might well come down, poor fellow! I tell you what, Ned, I'm afraid it hasn't been all right with Reuben! Just think of him riding a horse over these stones without a shoe! Why, if he had been in his right senses, he would just as soon have tried to ride him over the moon. I'm afraid it has been the old thing over again. Poor Susan! she looked awfully pale when she came to my house to ask if he had not come home. She made believe she was not a bit anxious, and talked of a lot of things that might have kept him. But for all that, she begged me to go and meet him—but what must we do? There's the horse to get home as well as the body—and that will be no easy matter.”

Then followed a conversation between them, till it was agreed that Robert as the groom should lead me, and that Ned must take the body. It was a hard job to get it into the dog-cart, for there was no one to hold Ginger; but she knew as well as I did what was going on, and stood as still as a stone. I noticed that, because, if she had a fault, it was that she was impatient in standing.

Ned started off very slowly with his sad load, and Robert came and looked at my foot again; then he took his handkerchief and bound it closely round, and so he led me home. I shall never forget that night walk; it was more than three miles. Robert led me on very slowly, and I limped and hobbled on as well as I could with great pain. I am sure he was sorry for me, for he often patted and encouraged me, talking to me in a pleasant voice.

At last I reached my own box, and had some corn, and after Robert had wrapped up my knees in wet cloths, he tied up my foot in a bran poultice to draw out the heat and cleanse it before the horse doctor saw it in the morning, and I managed to get myself down on the straw, and slept in spite of the pain.

The next day, after the farrier had examined my wounds, he said he hoped the joint was not injured, and if so, I should not be spoiled for work, but I should never lose the blemish. I believe they did the best to make a good cure, but it was a long and painful one; proud fiesh, as they called it, came up in my knees, and was burned out with caustic, and when at last it was healed, they put a blistering fiuid over the front of both knees to bring all the hair off: they had some reason for this, and I suppose it was all right.

As Smith's death had been so sudden, and no one was there to see it, there was an inquest held. The landlord and hostler at the White Lion, with several other people, gave evidence that he was intoxicated when he started from the inn. The keeper of the toll-gate said he rode at a hard gallop through the gate; and my shoe was picked up amongst the stones, so that the case was quite plain to them, and I was cleared of all blame.

Everybody pitied Susan; she was nearly out of her mind; she kept saying over and over again,“Oh! he was so good—so good! It was all that cursed drink; why will they sell that cursed drink? Oh, Reuben, Reuben!”So she went on till after he was buried, and then, as she had no home or relations, she, with her six little children, was obliged once more to leave the pleasant home by the tall oak trees, and go into that great gloomy Union House.





27　Ruined and Going Down-hill


As soon as my knees were sufficiently healed, I was turned into a small meadow for a month or two; no other creature was there, and though I enjoyed the liberty and the sweet grass, yet I had been so long used to society that I felt very lonely. Ginger and I had become fast friends, and now I missed her company extremely. I often neighed when I heard horses' feet passing in the road, but I seldom got an answer; till one morning the gate was opened, and who should come in but dear old Ginger. The man slipped off her halter and left her there. With a joyful whinny I trotted up to her; we were both glad to meet, but I soon found that it was not for our pleasure that she was brought to be with me. Her story would be too long to tell, but the end of it was that she had been ruined by hard riding, and was now turned off to see what rest would do.

Lord George was young and would take no warning; he was a hard rider, and would hunt whenever he could get the chance, quite careless of his horse. Soon after I left the stable there was a steeplechase, and he determined to ride. Though the groom told him she was a little strained, and was not fit for the race, he did not believe it, and on the day of the race urged Ginger to keep up with the foremost riders. With her high spirit, she strained herself to the utmost; she came in with the first three horses, but her wind was touched, besides which, he was too heavy for her, and her back was strained;“And so,”she said,“here we are—ruined in the prime of our youth and strength—you by a drunkard, and I by a fool; it is very hard.”We both felt in ourselves that we were not what we had been. However, that did not spoil the pleasure we had in each other's company; we did not gallop about as we once did, but we used to feed, and lie down together, and stand for hours under one of the shady lime trees with our heads close to each other; and so we passed our time till the family returned from town.

One day we saw the Earl come into the meadow, and York was with him. Seeing who it was, we stood still under our lime tree, and let them come up to us. They examined us carefully. The Earl seemed much annoyed.

“There is three hundred pounds fiung away for no earthly use,”said he;“but what I care most for is that these horses of my old friend, who thought they would find a good home with me, are ruined. The mare shall have a twelve-month's run, and we shall see what that will do for her; but the black one, he must be sold; 'tis a great pity, but I could not have knees like these in my stables.”

“No, my lord, of course not,”said York;“but he might get a place where appearance is not of much consequence, and still be well treated. I know a man in Bath, the master of some livery stables, who often wants a good horse at a low figure; I know he looks well after his horses. The inquest cleared the horse's character, and your lordship's recommendation, or mine, would be sufficient warrant for him.”

“You had better write to him, York. I should be more particular about the place than the money he would fetch.”

After this they left us.

“They'll soon take you away,”said Ginger,“and I shall lose the only friend I have, and most likely we shall never see each other again. 'tis a hard world!”

About a week after this, Robert came into the field with a halter, which he slipped over my head, and led me away. There was no leave-taking of Ginger; we neighed to each other as I was led off, and she trotted anxiously along by the hedge, calling to me as long as she could hear the sound of my feet.

Through the recommendation of York, I was bought by the master of the livery stables. I had to go by train, which was new to me, and required a good deal of courage the first time; but as I found the puffing, rushing, whistling, and, more than all, the trembling of the horse-box in which I stood did me no real harm, I soon took it quietly.

When I reached the end of my journey I found myself in a tolerably comfortable stable, and well attended to. These stables were not so airy and pleasant as those I had been used to. The stalls were laid on a slope instead of being level, and as my head was kept tied to the manger, I was obliged always to stand on the slope, which was very fatiguing. Men do not seem to know yet that horses can do more work if they can stand comfortably and can turn about; however, I was well fed and well cleaned, and, on the whole, I think our master took as much care of us as he could. He kept a good many horses and carriages of different kinds for hire. Sometimes his own men drove them; at others, the horse and chaise were let to gentlemen or ladies who drove themselves.





28　A Job Horse and His Drivers


Hitherto I had always been driven by people who at least knew how to drive; but in this place I was to get my experience of all the different kinds of bad and ignorant driving to which we horses are subjected; for I was a“job horse,”and was let out to all sorts of people who wished to hire me; and as I was good-tempered and gentle, I think I was oftener let out to the ignorant drivers than some of the other horses, because I could be depended upon. It would take a long time to tell of all the different styles in which I was driven, but I will mention a few of them.

First, there were the tight-rein drivers—men who seemed to think that all depended on holding the reins as hard as they could, never relaxing the pull on the horse's mouth, or giving him the least liberty of movement. They are always talking about“keeping the horse well in hand,”and“holding a horse up,”just as if a horse was not made to hold himself up.

Some poor, broken-down horses, whose mouths have been made hard and insensible by just such drivers as these, may, perhaps, find some support in it; but for a horse who can depend upon his own legs, and who has a tender mouth, and is easily guided, it is not only tormenting, but it is stupid.

Then there are the loose-rein drivers, who let the reins lie easily on our backs, and their own hand rest lazily on their knees. Of course, such gentlemen have no control over a horse, if anything happens suddenly. If a horse shies, or starts, or stumbles, they are nowhere and cannot help the horse or themselves, till the mischief is done. Of course, for myself, I had no objection to it, as I was not in the habit either of starting or stumbling, and had only been used to depend on my driver for guidance and encouragement; still, one likes to feel the rein a little in going downhill, and likes to know that one's driver is not gone to sleep.

Besides, a slovenly way of driving gets a horse into bad and often lazy habits; and when he changes hands, he has to be whipped out of them with more or less pain and trouble. Squire Gordon always kept us to our best paces, and our best manners. He said that spoiling a horse and letting him get into bad habits was just as cruel as spoiling a child, and both had to suffer for it afterward.

Besides, these drivers are often careless altogether, and will attend to anything else rather than their horses. I went out in the phaeton one day with one of them; he had a lady, and two children behind. He fiopped the reins about as we started, and of course gave me several unmeaning cuts with the whip, though I was fairly off. There had been a good deal of road-mending going on, and even where the stones were not freshly laid down there were a great many loose ones about. My driver was laughing and joking with the lady and the children, and talking about the country to the right and the left; but he never thought it worth while to keep an eye on his horse or to drive on the smoothest parts of the road; and so it easily happened that I got a stone in one of my fore feet.

Now, if Mr. Gordon, or John, or in fact any good driver, had been there, he would have seen that something was wrong before I had gone three paces. Or even if it had been dark, a practiced hand would have felt by the rein that there was something wrong in the step, and they would have got down and picked out the stone. But this man went on laughing and talking, whilst at every step the stone became more firmly wedged between my shoe and the frog of my foot. The stone was sharp on the inside and round on the outside, which, as everyone knows, is the most dangerous kind that a horse can pick up; at the same time cutting his foot, and making him most liable to stumble and fall.

Whether the man was partly blind or only very careless, I can't say; but he drove me with that stone in my foot for a good half-mile before he saw anything. By that time I was going so lame with the pain that at last he saw it and called out,“Well, here's a go! Why, they have sent us out with a lame horse! What a shame!”

He then chucked the reins and fiipped about with the whip, saying,“Now, then, it's no use playing the old soldier with me; there's the journey to go and it's no use turning lame and lazy.”

Just at this time a farmer came riding up on a brown cob. He lifted his hat and pulled up.

“I beg your pardon, sir,”he said,“but I think there is something the matter with your horse. He goes very much as if he had a stone in his shoe. If you will allow me, I will look at his feet; these loose scattered stones are confounded dangerous things for the horses.”

“He's a hired horse,”said my driver;“I don't know what's the matter with him, but it is a great shame to send out a lame beast like this.”

The farmer dismounted, and slipping his rein over his arm at once took up my near foot.

“Bless me, there's a stone! Lame! I should think so!”

At first he tried to dislodge it with his hand, but as it was now very tightly wedged, he drew a stone-pick out of his pocket, and very carefully, and with some trouble, got it out. Then holding it up, he said,“There, that's the stone your horse had picked up; It is a wonder he did not fall down and break his knees into the bargain!”

“Well, to be sure!”said my driver,“that is a queer thing! I never knew that horses picked up stones before!”

“Didn't you?”said the farmer, rather contemptuously;“but they do, though, and the best of them will do it, and can't help it sometimes on such roads as these. And if you don't want to lame your horse, you must look sharp and get them out quickly. This foot is very much bruised,”he said, setting it gently down and patting me.“If I might advise, sir, you had better drive him gently for a while; the foot is a good deal hurt, and the lameness will not go off directly.”

Then mounting his cob and raising his hat to the lady, he trotted off.

When he was gone, my driver began to fiop the reins about, and whip the harness, by which I understood that I was to go on, which of course I did, glad that the stone was gone, but still in a good deal of pain.

This was the sort of experience we job-horses often came in for.





29　Cockneys


Then there is the steam-engine style of driving; these drivers were mostly people from towns, who never had a horse of their own, and generally traveled by rail.

They always seemed to think that a horse was something like a steam-engine, only smaller. At any rate, they think that if only they pay for it, a horse is bound to go just as far, and just as fast, and with just as heavy a load as they please. And be the roads heavy and muddy, or dry and good; be they stony or smooth, up-hill or down-hill, it is all the same—on, on, on, one must go at the same pace, with no relief and no consideration.

These people never think of getting out to walk up a steep hill. Oh, no, they have paid to ride, and ride they will! The horse? Oh, he's used to it! What were horses made for, if not to drag people up-hill? Walk! A good joke indeed! And so the whip is plied and the rein is chucked, and often a rough scolding voice cries out,“Go along, you lazy beast!”And then another slash of the whip, when all the time we are doing our very best to get along, uncomplaining and obedient, though often sorely harassed and down-hearted.

This steam-engine style of driving wears us up faster than any other kind. I would far rather go twenty miles with a good considerate driver, than I would go ten with some of these; it would take less out of me.

Another thing—they scarcely ever put on the brake, however steep the down-hill may be, and thus bad accidents sometimes happen; or if they do put it on, they often forget to take it off at the bottom of the hill; and more than once I have had to pull half-way up the next hill, with one of the wheels held by the brake, before my driver chose to think about it; and that is a terrible strain on a horse.

Then these Cockneys, instead of starting at an easy pace as a gentleman would do, generally set off at full speed from the very stable yard; and when they want to stop, they first whip us and then pull up so suddenly, that we are nearly thrown on our haunches, and our mouths jagged with the bit; they call that pulling up with a dash! and when they turn a corner, they do it as sharply as if there were no right side or wrong side of the road.

I well remember one spring evening I and Rory had been out for the day. (Rory was the horse that mostly went with me when a pair was ordered, and a good honest fellow he was.) We had our own driver, and as he was always considerate and gentle with us, we had a very pleasant day. We were coming home at a good smart pace about twilight; our road turned sharp to the left; but as we were close to the hedge on our own side, and there was plenty of room to pass, our driver did not pull us in. As we neared the corner I heard a horse and two wheels coming rapidly down the hill towards us. The hedge was high and I could see nothing, but the next moment we were upon each other. Happily for me, I was on the side next the hedge. Rory was on the left side of the pole, and had not even a shaft to protect him. The man who was driving was making straight for the corner, and when he came in sight of us he had no time to pull over to his own side. The whole shock came upon Rory. The gig shaft ran right into his chest, making him stagger back with a cry that I shall never forget. The other horse was thrown upon his haunches, and one shaft broken. It turned out that it was a horse from our own stables, with the high-wheeled gig, that the young men were so fond of.

The driver was one of those random, ignorant fellows, who don't even know which is their own side of the road, or if they know, don't care. And there was poor Rory with his fiesh torn open and bleeding, and the blood streaming down. They said if it had been a little more to one side it would have killed him; and a good thing for him, poor fellow, if it had.

As it was, it was a long time before the wound healed, and then he was sold for coal carting; and what that is, up and down those steep hills, only horses know. Some of the sights I saw there, where a horse had to come down-hill with a heavily-loaded two-wheel cart behind him, on which no drag could be placed, make me sad even now to think of.

After Rory was disabled, I often went in the carriage with a mare named Peggy, who stood in the next stall to mine. She was a strong, well-made animal, of a bright dun color, beautifully dappled, and with a dark brown mane and tail. There was no high breeding about her, but she was very pretty, and remarkably sweet-tempered and willing. Still, there was an anxious look about her eye, by which I knew that she had some trouble. The first time we went out together I thought she had a very odd pace; she seemed to go partly in a trot, partly a canter—three or four paces, and then to make a little jump forward.

It was very unpleasant for any horse who pulled with her, and made me quite fidgety. When we got home, I asked her what made her go in that odd, awkward way.

“Ah,”she said in a troubled manner,“I know my paces are very bad, but what can I do? It really is not my fault, it is just because my legs are so short. I stand nearly as high as you, but your legs are a good three inches longer above your knees than mine, and of course you can take a much longer step, and go much faster. You see, I did not make myself; I wish I could have done so, I would have had long legs then; all my troubles come from my short legs,”said Peggy, in a desponding tone.

“But how is it,”I said,“when you are so strong and good-tempered and willing?”

“Why, you see,”said she,“men will go so fast, and if one can't keep up to other horses, it is nothing but whip, whip, whip, all the time. And so I have had to keep up as I could, and have got into this ugly shuffiing pace. It was not always so; when I lived with my first master I always went a good regular trot, but then he was not in such a hurry. He was a young clergyman in the country, and a good, kind master he was. He had two churches a good way apart, and a great deal of work, but he never scolded or whipped me for not going faster. He was very fond of me. I only wish I was with him now; but he had to leave and go to a large town, and then I was sold to a farmer.

“Some farmers, you know, are capital masters; but I think this one was a low sort of man. He cared nothing about good horses or good driving; he only cared for going fast. I went as fast as I could, but that would not do, and he was always whipping; so I got into this way of making a spring forward to keep up. On market nights he used to stay very late at the inn, and then drive home at a gallop.

“One dark night he was galloping home as usual, when all of a sudden the wheel came against some great heavy thing in the road, and turned the gig over in a minute. He was thrown out and his arm broken, and some of his ribs, I think. At any rate, it was the end of my living with him, and I was not sorry. But you see it will be the same everywhere for me, if men must go so fast. I wish my legs were longer!”

Poor Peggy! I was very sorry for her, and I could not comfort her, for I knew how hard it was upon slow-paced horses to be put with fast ones; all the whipping comes to their share, and they can't help it.

She was often used in the phaeton, and was very much liked by some of the ladies, because she was so gentle; and some time after this she was sold to two ladies who drove themselves, and wanted a safe, good horse.

I met her several times out in the country, going a good steady pace, and looking as gay and contented as a horse could be. I was very glad to see her, for she deserved a good place.

After she left us, another horse came in her stead. He was young, and had a bad name for shying and starting, by which he had lost a good place. I asked him what made him shy.

“Well, I hardly know,”he said;“I was timid when I was young, and was a good deal frightened several times, and if I saw anything strange I used to turn and look at it—you see, with our blinkers on one can't see or understand what a thing is unless one looks round; and then my master always gave me a whipping, which of course made me start on, and did not make me less afraid. I think if he would have let me just look at things quietly, and see that there was nothing to hurt me, it would have been all right, and I should have got used to them. One day an old gentleman was riding with him, and a large piece of white paper or rag blew across just on one side of me; I shied and started forward—my master as usual whipped me smartly, but the old man cried out, ‘You're wrong! you're wrong! you should never whip a horse for shying; he shies because he is frightened, and you only frighten him more and make the habit worse.’ So I suppose all men don't do so. I am sure I don't want to shy for the sake of it; but how should one know what is dangerous and what is not, if one is never allowed to get used to anything? I am never afraid of what I know. Now I was brought up in a park where there were deer; of course, I knew them as well as I did a sheep or a cow, but they are not common, and I know many sensible horses who are frightened at them, and who kick up quite a shindy before they will pass a paddock where there are deer.”

I knew what my companion said was true, and I wished that every young horse had as good a master as Farmer Grey and Squire Gordon.

Of course we sometimes came in for good driving here. I remember one morning I was put into the light gig, and taken to a house in Pulteney Street. Two gentlemen came out; the taller of them came round to my head, he looked at the bit and bridle, and just shifted the collar with his hand, to see if it fitted comfortably.

“Do you consider this horse wants a curb?”he said to the hostler.

“Well,”said the man,“I should say he would go just as well without, he has an uncommon good mouth, and though he has a fine spirit, he has no vice; but we generally find people like the curb.”

“I don't like it,”said the gentleman;“be so good as to take it off, and put the rein in at the cheek; an easy mouth is a great thing on a long journey, is it not, old fellow?”he said, patting my neck.

Then he took the reins, and they both got up. I can remember now how quietly he turned me round, and then with a light feel of the rein, and drawing the whip gently across my back, we were off.

I arched my neck and set off at my best pace. I found I had someone behind me who knew how a good horse ought to be driven. It seemed like old times again, and made me feel quite gay.

This gentleman took a great liking to me, and after trying me several times with the saddle he prevailed upon my master to sell me to a friend of his, who wanted a safe, pleasant horse for riding. And so it came to pass that in the summer I was sold to Mr. Barry.





30　A Thief


My new master was an unmarried man. He lived at Bath, and was much engaged in business. His doctor advised him to take horse exercise, and for this purpose he bought me. He hired a stable a short distance from his lodgings, and engaged a man named Filcher as groom. My master knew very little about horses, but he treated me well, and I should have had a good and easy place but for circumstances of which he was ignorant. He ordered the best hay with plenty of oats, crushed beans, and bran, with vetches, or rye grass, as the man might think needful. I heard the master give the order, so I knew there was plenty of good food, and I thought I was well off.

For a few days all went on well; I found that my groom understood his business. He kept the stable clean and airy, and he groomed me thoroughly; and was never otherwise than gentle. He had been an hostler in one of the great hotels in Bath. He had given that up, and now cultivated fruit and vegetables for the market; and his wife bred and fattened poultry and rabbits for sale. After a while it seemed to me that my oats came very short; I had the beans, but bran was mixed with them instead of oats, of which there were very few; certainly not more than a quarter of what there should have been. In two or three weeks this began to tell upon my strength and spirits. The grass food, though very good, was not the thing to keep up my condition without corn. However, I could not complain, nor make known my wants. So it went on for about two months; and I wondered my master did not see that something was the matter. However, one afternoon he rode out into the country to see a friend of his—a gentleman farmer, who lived on the road to Wells. This gentleman had a very quick eye for horses; and after he had welcomed his friend, he said, casting his eye over me:

“It seems to me, Barry, that your horse does not look so well as he did when you first had him. Has he been well?”

“Yes, I believe so,”said my master;“but he is not nearly so lively as he was; my groom tells me that horses are always dull and weak in the autumn, and that I must expect it.”

“Autumn! fiddlesticks!”said the farmer.“Why, this is only August; and with your light work and good food he ought not to go down like this, even if it was autumn. How do you feed him?”

My master told him. The other shook his head slowly, and began to feel me over.

“I can't say who eats your corn, my dear fellow, but I am much mistaken if your horse gets it. Have you ridden very fast?”

“No! very gently.”

“Then just put your hand here,”said he, passing his hand over my neck and shoulder;“he is as warm and damp as a horse just come up from grass. I advise you to look into your stable a little more. I hate to be suspicious, and, thank heaven, I have no cause to be, for I can trust my men, present or absent; but there are mean scoundrels, wicked enough to rob a dumb beast of his food; you must look into it.”And turning to his man who had come to take me:“Give this horse a right good feed of bruised oats, and don't stint him.”

“Dumb beasts!”yes, we are; but if I could have spoken I could have told my master where his oats went to. My groom used to come every morning about six o'clock, and with him a little boy, who always had a covered basket with him. He used to go with his father into the harness-room where the corn was kept, and I could see them when the door stood ajar, fill a little bag with oats out of the bin and then he used to be off.

Five or six mornings after this, just as the boy had left the stable, the door was pushed open and a policeman walked in, holding the child tight by the arm; another policeman followed, and locked the door on the inside, saying,“Show me the place where your father keeps his rabbits' food.”

The boy looked very frightened and began to cry; but there was no escape, and he led the way to the corn-bin. Here the policeman found another empty bag like that which was found full of oats in the boy's basket.

Filcher was cleaning my feet at the time, but they soon saw him, and though he blustered a good deal, they walked him off to the“lock-up,”and his boy with him. I heard afterwards that the boy was not held to be guilty, but the man was sentenced to prison for two months.





31　A Humbug


My master was not immediately suited, but in a few days my new groom came. He was a tall, good-looking fellow enough; but if ever there was a humbug in the shape of a groom, Alfred Smirk was the man. He was very civil to me, and never used me ill; in fact, he did a great deal of stroking and patting, when his master was there to see it. He always brushed my mane and tail with water, and my hoofs with oil before he brought me to the door, to make me look smart; but as to cleaning my feet, or looking to my shoes, or grooming me thoroughly, he thought no more of that than if I had been a cow. He left my bit rusty, my saddle damp, and my crupper stiff.

Alfred Smirk considered himself very handsome; he spent a great deal of time about his hair, whiskers, and necktie before a little looking-glass in the harness room. When his master was speaking to him, it was always,“Yes, sir; yes, sir;”touching his hat at every word; and every one thought he was a very nice young man, and that Mr. Barry was very fortunate to meet with him. I should say he was the laziest, most conceited fellow I ever came near. Of course it was a great thing not to be ill-used, but then a horse wants more than that. I had a loose box, and might have been very comfortable if he had not been too indolent to clean it out. He never took all the straw away, and the smell from what lay underneath was very bad; while the strong vapors that rose up made my eyes smart and infiame, and I did not feel the same appetite for my food.

One day his master came in and said,“Alfred, the stable smells rather strong; should not you give that stall a good scrub, and throw down plenty of water?”

“Well, sir,”he said, touching his cap,“I'll do so if you please, sir, but it is rather dangerous, sir, throwing down water in a horse's box, they are very apt to take cold, sir. I should not like to do him an injury, but I'll do it if you please, sir.”

“Well,”said his master,“I should not like him to take cold, but I don't like the smell of this stable; do you think the drains are all right?”

“Well, sir, now you mention it, I think the drain does sometimes send back a smell; there may be something wrong, sir.”

“Then send for the bricklayer and have it seen to,”said his master.

“Yes, sir, I will.”

The bricklayer came and pulled up a great many bricks, and found nothing amiss; so he put down some lime and charged the master five shillings, and the smell in my box was as bad as ever; but that was not all—standing as I did on a quantity of moist straw, my feet grew unhealthy and tender, and the master used to say:

“I don't know what is the matter with this horse, he goes very fumble-footed. I am sometimes afraid he will stumble.”

“Yes, sir,”said Alfred,“I have noticed the same myself, when I have exercised him.”

Now the fact was that he hardly ever did exercise me, and when the master was busy, I often stood for days together without stretching my legs at all, and yet being fed just as high as if I were at hard work. This often disordered my health, and made me sometimes heavy and dull, but more often restless and feverish. He never even gave me a meal of green food or a bran mash, which would have cooled me, for he was altogether as ignorant as he was conceited; and then, instead of exercise or change of food, I had to take horse balls and draughts; which, beside the nuisance of having them poured down my throat, used to make me feel ill and uncomfortable.

One day my feet were so tender, that trotting over some fresh stones with my master on my back, I made two such serious stumbles, that as he came down Lansdown into the city, he stopped at the farrier's, and asked him to see what was the matter with me. The man took up my feet one by one and examined them; then standing up and dusting his hands one against the other, he said:

“Your horse has got the ‘thrush,’ and badly too; his feet are very tender; it is fortunate that he has not been down. I wonder your groom has not seen to it before. This is the sort of thing we find in foul stables, where the litter is never properly cleaned out. If you will send him here to-morrow I will attend to the hoof, and I will direct your man how to apply the liniment which I will give him.”

The next day I had my feet thoroughly cleansed and stuffed with tow, soaked in some strong lotion; and a very unpleasant business it was.

The farrier ordered all the litter to be taken out of my box day by day, and the fioor kept very clean. Then I was to have bran mashes, a little green food, and not so much corn, till my feet were well again. With this treatment I soon regained my spirits, but Mr. Barry was so much disgusted at being twice deceived by his grooms that he determined to give up keeping a horse, and to hire when he wanted one. I was therefore kept till my feet were quite sound, and was then sold again.





PART THREE





32　A Horse Fair


No doubt a horse fair is a very amusing place to those who have nothing to lose; at any rate, there is plenty to see.

Long strings of young horses out of the country, fresh from the marshes; and droves of shaggy little Welsh ponies, no higher than Merrylegs; and hundreds of cart horses of all sorts, some of them with their long tails braided up, and tied with scarlet cord; and a good many like myself, handsome and high-bred, but fallen into the middle class, through some accident or blemish, unsoundness of wind, or some other complaint. There were some splendid animals quite in their prime, and fit for anything; they were throwing out their legs and showing off their paces in high style, as they were trotted out with a leading rein, the groom running by the side. But round in the background there were a number of poor things, sadly broken down with hard work; with their knees knuckling over, and their hind legs swinging out at every step; and there were some very dejected-looking old horses, with the under lip hanging down, and the ears laying back heavily, as if there was no more pleasure in life, and no more hope; there were some so thin, you might see all their ribs, and some with old sores on their backs and hips; these were sad sights for a horse to look upon, who knows not but he may come to the same state.

There was a great deal of bargaining; of running up and beating down, and if a horse may speak his mind so far as he understands, I should say, there were more lies told, and more trickery at that horse fair, than a clever man could give an account of. I was put with two or three other strong, useful-looking horses, and a good many people came to look at us. The gentlemen always turned from me when they saw my broken knees; though the man who had me swore it was only a slip in the stall.

The first thing was to pull my mouth open, then to look at my eyes, then feel all the way down my legs, and give me a hard feel of the skin and fiesh, and then try my paces. It was wonderful what a difference there was in the way these things were done. Some did it in a rough off-hand way, as if one was only a piece of wood; while others would take their hands gently over one's body, with a pat now and then, as much as to say,“by your leave.”Of course I judged a good deal of the buyers by their manners to myself.

There was one man, I thought, if he would buy me, I should be happy. He was not a gentleman, nor yet one of the loud fiashy sort that called themselves so. He was rather a small man, but well made and quick in all his motions. I knew in a moment, by the way he handled me, that he was used to horses; he spoke gently, and his grey eye had a kindly, cheery look in it. It may seem strange to say—but it is true all the same—that the clean fresh smell there was about him made me take to him; no smell of old beer and tobacco, which I hated, but a fresh smell as if he had come out of a hayloft. He offered twenty-three pounds for me; but that was refused, and he walked away. I looked after him, but he was gone, and a very hard-looking, loud-voiced man came. I was dreadfully afraid he would have me; but he walked off. One or two more came who did not mean business. Then the hard-faced man came back again and offered twenty-three pounds. A very close bargain was being driven; for my salesman began to think he should not get all he asked, and must come down; but just then the grey-eyed man came back again. I could not help reaching out my head towards him. He stroked my face kindly.

“Well, old chap,”he said,“I think we should suit each other. I'll give twenty-four for him.”

“Say twenty-five and you shall have him.”

“Twenty-four ten,”said my friend, in a very decided tone,“and not another sixpence—yes or no?”

“Done,”said the salesman,“and you may depend upon it there's a monstrous deal of quality in that horse, and if you want him for cab work, he's a bargain.”

The money was paid on the spot, and my new master took my halter, and led me out of the fair to an inn, where he had a saddle and bridle ready. He gave me a good feed of oats and stood by whilst I ate it, talking to himself and talking to me. Half-an-hour after, we were on our way to London, through pleasant lanes and country roads, until we came into the great London thoroughfare, on which we traveled steadily, till in the twilight we reached the great city. The gas lamps were already lighted; there were streets to the right, and streets to the left, and streets crossing each other for mile upon mile. I thought we should never come to the end of them. At last, in passing through one, we came to a long cab stand, when my rider called out in a cheery voice,“Good night, Governor!”

“Halloo!”cried a voice.“Have you got a good one?”

“I think so,”replied my owner.

“I wish you luck with him.”

“Thank ye, Governor,”and he rode on. We soon turned up one of the side streets, and about half way up that, we turned into a very narrow street, with rather poor-looking houses on one side, and what seemed to be coach-houses and stables on the other.

My owner pulled up at one of the houses and whistled. The door fiew open, and a young woman, followed by a little girl and boy, ran out. There was a very lively greeting as my rider dismounted.

“Now, then, Harry, my boy, open the gates, and mother will bring us the lantern.”

The next minute they were all standing round me in a small stable yard.

“Is he gentle, father?”

“Yes, Dolly, as gentle as your own kitten; come and pat him.”

At once the little hand was patting about all over my shoulder without fear. How good it felt!

“Let me get him a bran mash while you rub him down,”said the mother.

“Do, Polly, it's just what he wants; and I know you've got a beautiful mash ready for me.”

“Sausage dumpling and apple turnover!”shouted the boy, which set them all laughing. I was led into a comfortable, clean-smelling stall, with plenty of dry straw, and after a capital supper I lay down, thinking I was going to be happy.





33　A London Cab Horse


My new master's name was Jeremiah Barker, but as every one called him Jerry, I shall do the same. Polly, his wife, was just as good a match as a man could have. She was a plump, trim, tidy little woman, with smooth dark hair, dark eyes, and a merry little mouth. The boy was nearly twelve years old: a tall, frank, good-tempered lad; and little Dorothy (Dolly they called her) was her mother over again, at eight years old. They were all wonderfully fond of each other; I never knew such a happy, merry family before, or since. Jerry had a cab of his own, and two horses, which he drove and attended to himself. His other horse was a tall, white, rather large-boned animal called Captain; he was old now, but when he was young, he must have been splendid; he had still a proud way of holding his head and arching his neck; in fact, he was a high-bred, fine-mannered, noble old horse, every inch of him. He told me that in his early youth he went to the Crimean War; he belonged to an officer in the cavalry, and used to lead the regiment; I will tell more of that hereafter.

The next morning, when I was well groomed, Polly and Dolly came into the yard to see me and make friends. Harry had been helping his father since the early morning, and had stated his opinion that I should turn out“a regular brick.”Polly brought me a slice of apple, and Dolly a piece of bread, and made as much of me as if I had been the“Black Beauty”of olden time. It was a great treat to be petted again, and talked to in a gentle voice, and I let them see as well as I could that I wished to be friendly. Polly thought I was very handsome, and a great deal too good for a cab, if it was not for the broken knees.

“Of course there's no one to tell us whose fault that was,”said Jerry,“and as long as I don't know, I shall give him the benefit of the doubt; for a firmer, neater stepper I never rode; we'll call him ‘Jack,’ after the old one—shall we, Polly?”

“Do,”she said,“for I like to keep a good name going.”

Captain went out in the cab all the morning. Harry came in after school to feed me and give me water. In the afternoon I was put into the cab. Jerry took as much pains to see if the collar and bridle fitted comfortably as if he had been John Manly over again. When the crupper was let out a hole or two, it all fitted well. There was no bearing rein—no curb—nothing but a plain ring snaffie. What a blessing that was!

After driving through the side street we came to the large cab stand where Jerry had said“Good night.”On one side of this wide street were high houses with wonderful shop fronts, and on the other was an old church and churchyard, surrounded by iron palisades. Alongside these iron rails a number of cabs were drawn up, waiting for passengers: bits of hay were lying about on the ground; some of the men were standing together, talking; some were sitting on their boxes reading the newspaper; and one or two were feeding their horses with bits of hay, and a drink of water. We pulled up in the rank at the back of the last cab. Two or three men came round and began to look at me and pass their remarks.

“Very good for a funeral,”said one.

“Too smart-looking,”said another, shaking his head in a very wise way;“you'll find out something wrong one of these fine mornings, or my name isn't Jones.”

“Well,”said Jerry pleasantly,“I suppose I need not find it out till it finds me out; eh? and if so, I'll keep up my spirits a little longer.”

Then came up a broad-faced man, dressed in a great grey coat with great grey capes, and great white buttons, a grey hat, and a blue comforter loosely tied round his neck; his hair was grey too, but he was a jolly-looking fellow, and the other men made way for him. He looked me all over, as if he had been going to buy me; and then, straightening himself up with a grunt, he said,“He's the right sort for you, Jerry. I don't care what you gave for him, he'll be worth it.”Thus my character was established on the stand.

This man's name was Grant, but he was called“Grey Grant,”or“Governor Grant.”He had been the longest on that stand of any of the men, and he took it upon himself to settle matters and stop disputes. He was generally a good-humored, sensible man; but if his temper was a little out, as it was sometimes, when he had drunk too much, nobody liked to come too near his fist, for he could deal a very heavy blow.

The first week of my life as a cab horse was very trying; I had never been used to London, and the noise, the hurry, the crowds of horses, carts, and carriages that I had to make my way through made me feel anxious and harassed; but I soon found that I could perfectly trust my driver, and then I made myself easy, and got used to it.

Jerry was as good a driver as I had ever known; and what was better, he took as much thought for his horses as he did for himself. He soon found out that I was willing to work, and do my best; and he never laid the whip on me, unless it was gently drawing the end of it over my back, when I was to go on; but generally I knew this quite well by the way in which he took up the reins; and I believe his whip was more frequently stuck up by his side than in his hand.

In a short time I and my master understood each other as well as horse and man can do. In the stable, too, he did all that he could for our comfort. The stalls were the old-fashioned style, too much on the slope; but he had two movable bars fixed across the back of our stalls, so that at night, and when we were resting, he just took off our halters and put up the bars, and thus we could turn about and stand whichever way we pleased, which is a great comfort.

Jerry kept us very clean, and gave us as much change of food as he could, and always plenty of it; and not only that, but he always gave us plenty of clean, fresh water, which he allowed to stand by us both night and day, except of course when we came in warm. Some people say that a horse ought not to drink all he likes; but I know if we are allowed to drink when we want it, we drink only a little at a time, and it does us a great deal more good than swallowing down half a bucketful at a time because we have been left without till we are thirsty and miserable. Some grooms will go home to their beer and leave us for hours with our dry hay and oats and nothing to moisten them; then of course we gulp down too much at once, which helps to spoil our breathing and sometimes chills our stomachs. But the best thing we had here was our Sundays for rest; we worked so hard in the week that I do not think we could have kept up to it, but for that day; besides, we had then time to enjoy each other's company. It was on these days that I learned my companion's history.





34　 An Old War Horse


Captain had been broken in and trained for an army horse; his first owner was an officer of cavalry going out to the Crimean War. He said he quite enjoyed the training with all the other horses, trotting together, turning together, to the right hand or the left, halting at the word of command, or dashing forward at full speed at the sound of the trumpet, or signal of the officer. He was, when young, a dark, dappled lion grey, and considered very handsome. His master, a young, high-spirited gentleman, was very fond of him, and treated him from the first with the greatest care and kindness. He told me he thought the life of an army horse was very pleasant; but when it came to being sent abroad over the sea in a great ship, he almost changed his mind.

“That part of it,”said he,“was dreadful! Of course we could not walk off the land into the ship; so they were obliged to put strong straps under our bodies, and then we were lifted off our legs in spite of our struggles, and were swung through the air over the water, to the deck of the great vessel. There we were placed in small close stalls, and never for a long time saw the sky, or were able to stretch our legs. The ship sometimes rolled about in high winds, and we were knocked about, and felt bad enough. However, at last it came to an end, and we were hauled up, and swung over again to the land; we were very glad, and snorted, and neighed for joy, when we once more felt firm ground under our feet.

“We soon found that the country we had come to was very different from our own and that we had many hardships to endure besides the fighting; but many of the men were so fond of their horses that they did everything they could to make them comfortable, in spite of snow, wet, and all things out of order.”

“But what about the fighting?”said I;“was not that worse than anything else?”

“Well,”said he,“I hardly know; we always liked to hear the trumpet sound, and to be called out, and were impatient to start off, though sometimes we had to stand for hours, waiting for the word of command; and when the word was given, we used to spring forward as gaily and eagerly as if there were no cannon balls, bayonets, or bullets. I believe so long as we felt our rider firm in the saddle, and his hand steady on the bridle, not one of us gave way to fear, not even when the terrible bomb-shells whirled through the air and burst into a thousand pieces.

“I, with my noble master, went into many actions together without a wound; and though I saw horses shot down with bullets, pierced through with lances, and gashed with fearful saber-cuts; though we left them dead on the field, or dying in the agony of their wounds, I don't think I feared for myself. My master's cheery voice, as he encouraged his men, made me feel as if he and I could not be killed. I had such perfect trust in him that whilst he was guiding me, I was ready to charge up to the very cannon's mouth. I saw many brave men cut down, many fall mortally wounded from their saddles. I had heard the cries and groans of the dying, I had cantered over ground slippery with blood, and frequently had to turn aside to avoid trampling on wounded man or horse, but, until one dreadful day, I had never felt terror; that day I shall never forget.”

Here old Captain paused for awhile and drew a long breath. I waited, and he went on.

“It was one autumn morning, and as usual, an hour before daybreak our cavalry had turned out, ready caparisoned for the day's work, whether it might be fighting or waiting. The men stood by their horses waiting, ready for orders. As the light increased, there seemed to be some excitement among the officers; and before the day was well begun, we heard the firing of the enemy's guns.

“Then one of the officers rode up and gave the word for the men to mount, and in a second every man was in his saddle, and every horse stood expecting the touch of the rein, or the pressure of his rider's heels, all animated, all eager; but still we had been trained so well that, except by the champing of our bits, and the restive tossing of our heads from time to time, it could not be said that we stirred.

“My dear master and I were at the head of the line, and as all sat motionless and watchful, he took a little stray lock of my mane which had turned over on the wrong side, laid it over on the right, and smoothed it down with his hand; then patting my neck, he said, ‘We shall have a day of it today, Bayard, my beauty; but we'll do our duty as we have done.’ He stroked my neck that morning more, I think, than he had ever done before; quietly on and on, as if he were thinking of something else. I loved to feel his hand on my neck, and arched my crest proudly and happily; but I stood very still, for I knew all his moods, and when he liked me to be quiet, and when gay.

“I cannot tell all that happened on that day, but I will tell of the last charge that we made together: it was across a valley right in front of the enemy's cannon. By this time we were well used to the roar of heavy guns, the rattle of musket fire, and the fiying of shot near us; but never had I been under such a fire as we rode through on that day. From the right, from the left, and from the front, shot and shell poured in upon us. Many a brave man went down, many a horse fell, fiinging his rider to the earth; many a horse without a rider ran wildly out of the ranks; then terrified at being alone, with no hand to guide him, came pressing in among his old companions, to gallop with them to the charge.

“Fearful as it was, no one stopped, no one turned back. Every moment the ranks were thinned, but as our comrades fell, we closed in to keep them together; and instead of being shaken or staggered in our pace, our gallop became faster and faster as we neared the cannon.

“My master, my dear master, was cheering on his comrades with his right arm raised on high, when one of the balls, whizzing close to my head, struck him. I felt him stagger with the shock, though he uttered no cry; I tried to check my speed, but the sword dropped from his right hand, the rein fell loose from the left, and sinking backward from the saddle he fell to the earth; the other riders swept past us, and by the force of their charge I was driven from the spot where he fell.

“I wanted to keep my place by his side, and not leave him under that rush of horses' feet, but it was in vain; and now, without a master or a friend, I was alone on that great slaughter ground; then fear took hold on me, and I trembled as I had never trembled before; and I too, as I had seen other horses do, tried to join in the ranks and gallop with them; but I was beaten off by the swords of the soldiers. Just then a soldier whose horse had been killed under him caught at my bridle and mounted me, and with this new master I was again going forward; but our gallant company was cruelly overpowered, and those who remained alive after the fierce fight for the guns came galloping back over the same ground. Some of the horses had been so badly wounded that they could scarcely move from the loss of blood; other noble creatures were trying on three legs to drag themselves along, and others were struggling to rise on their fore feet, when their hind legs had been shattered by shot. After the battle the wounded men were brought in, and the dead were buried.”

“And what about the wounded horses?”I said;“were they left to die?”

“No, the army farriers went over the field with their pistols and shot all that were ruined. Some that had only slight wounds were brought back and attended to, but the greater part of the noble willing creatures that went out that morning never came back! In our stables there was only about one in four that returned.

“I never saw my dear master again. I believe he fell dead from the saddle. I never loved any other master so well. I went into many other engagements, but was only once wounded, and then not seriously; and when the war was over, I came back again to England, as sound and strong as when I went out.”

I said,“I have heard people talk about war as if it was a very fine thing.”

“Ah!”said he,“I should think they never saw it. No doubt it is very fine when there is no enemy, when it is just exercise and parade, and sham-fight. Yes, it is very fine then; but when thousands of good brave men and horses are killed, or crippled for life, it has a very different look.”

“Do you know what they fought about?”said I.

“No,”he said,“that is more than a horse can understand, but the enemy must have been awfully wicked people, if it was right to go all that way over the sea on purpose to kill them.”





35　Jerry Barker


I never knew a better man than my new master; he was kind and good, and as strong for the right as John Manly; and so good-tempered and merry that very few people could pick a quarrel with him. He was very fond of making little songs, and singing them to himself. One he was very fond of was this:

Come, father and mother,

And sister and brother,

Come, all of you, turn to

And help one another.

And so they did; Harry was as clever at stable-work as a much older boy, and always wanted to do what he could. Then Polly and Dolly used to come in the morning to help with the cab—to brush and beat the cushions, and rub the glass, while Jerry was giving us a cleaning in the yard, and Harry was rubbing the harness. There used to be a great deal of laughing and fun between them, and it put Captain and me in much better spirits than if we had heard scolding and hard words. They were always early in the morning, for Jerry would say:

If you in the morning

Throw minutes away,

You can't pick them up

In the course of a day.

You may hurry and scurry,

And fiurry and worry,

You've Iost them forever,

Forever and aye.

He could not bear any careless loitering, and waste of time; and nothing was so near making him angry as to find people, who were always late, wanting a cab horse to be driven hard, to make up for their idleness.

One day, two wild-looking young men came out of a tavern close by the stand, and called Jerry.

“Here, cabby! look sharp, we are rather late; put on the steam, will you, and take us to the Victoria in time for the one o'clock train? You shall have a shilling extra.”

“I will take you at the regular pace, gentlemen; shillings don't pay for putting on the steam like that.”

Larry's cab was standing next to ours. He fiung open the door, and said,“I'm your man, gentlemen! Take my cab, my horse will get you there all right,”and as he shut them in, with a wink towards Jerry, said,“It's against his conscience to go beyond a jog-trot.”Then slashing his jaded horse, he set off as hard as he could. Jerry patted me on the neck.“No, Jack, a shilling would not pay for that sort of thing, would it, old boy?”

Although Jerry was determinedly set against hard driving to please careless people, he always went a good fair pace, and was not against putting on the steam, as he said, if only he knew why .

I well remember one morning, as we were on the stand waiting for a fare, that a young man, carrying a heavy portmanteau, trod on a piece of orange peel which lay on the pavement, and fell down with great force.

Jerry was the first to run and lift him up. He seemed much stunned, and as they led him into a shop, he walked as if he were in great pain. Jerry of course came back to the stand, but in about ten minutes one of the shopmen called him, so we drew up to the pavement.

“Can you take me to the South-Eastern Railway?”said the young man,“this unlucky fall has made me late, I fear; but it is of great importance that I should not lose the twelve o'clock train. I should be most thankful if you could get me there in time, and will gladly pay you an extra fare.”

“I'll do my very best,”said Jerry heartily,“if you think you are well enough, sir,”for he looked dreadfully white and ill.

“I must go,”he said earnestly,“please to open the door, and let us lose no time.”

The next minute Jerry was on the box; with a cheery chirrup to me, and a twitch of the rein that I well understood.

“Now then, Jack, my boy,”said he,“spin along, we'll show them how we can get over the ground, if we only know why.”

It is always difficult to drive fast in the city in the middle of the day, when the streets are full of traffic, but we did what could be done; and when a good driver and a good horse, who understand each other, are of one mind, it is wonderful what they can do. I had a very good mouth—that is, I could be guided by the slightest touch of the rein, and that is a great thing in London, among carriages, omnibuses, carts, vans, trucks, cabs, and great wagons creeping along at a walking pace; some going one way, some another, some going slowly, others wanting to pass them, omnibuses stopping short every few minutes to take up a passenger, obliging the horse that is coming behind to pull up too, or to pass, and get before them: perhaps you try to pass, but just then something else comes dashing in through the narrow opening, and you have to keep in behind the omnibus again; presently you think you see a chance, and manage to get to the front, going so near the wheels on each side that half an inch nearer and they would scrape. Well—you get along for a bit, but soon find yourself in a long train of carts and carriages all obliged to go at a walk; perhaps you come to a regular block-up, and have to stand still for minutes together, till something clears out into a side street, or the policeman interferes: you have to be ready for any chance—to dash forward if there be an opening, and be quick as a rat dog to see if there be room, and if there be time, lest you get your own wheels locked, or smashed, or the shaft of some other vehicle run into your chest or shoulder. All this is what you have to be ready for. If you want to get through London fast in the middle of the day, it wants a deal of practice.

Jerry and I were used to it, and no one could beat us at getting through when we were set upon it. I was quick, and bold, and could always trust my driver; Jerry was quick, and patient at the same time, and could trust his horse, which was a great thing too. He very seldom used the whip; I knew by his voice, and his“click, click,”when he wanted to get on fast, and by the rein where I was to go; so there was no need for whipping; but I must go back to my story.

The streets were very full that day, but we got on pretty well as far as the bottom of Cheapside, where there was a block for three or four minutes. The young man put his head out and said anxiously,“I think I had better get out and walk, I shall never get there if this goes on.”

“I'll do all that can be done, sir,”said Jerry,“I think we shall be in time; this block-up cannot last much longer, and your luggage is very heavy for you to carry, sir.”

Just then the cart in front of us began to move on, and then we had a good turn. In and out—in and out we went, as fast as horsefiesh could do it, and for a wonder had a good clear time on London Bridge, for there was a whole train of cabs and carriages, all going our way at a quick trot, perhaps wanting to catch that very train; at any rate we whirled into the station with many more, just as the great clock pointed to eight minutes to twelve o'clock.

“Thank God! we are in time,”said the young man,“and thank you, too, my friend, and your good horse; you have saved me more than money can ever pay for; take this extra half-crown.”

“No, sir, no, thank you all the same; so glad we hit the time, sir, but don't stay now, sir, the bell is ringing. Here, porter! take this gentleman's luggage—Dover line—twelve o'clock train—that's it,”and without waiting for another word, Jerry wheeled me round to make room for other cabs that were dashing up at the last minute, and drew up on one side till the crush was past.

“So glad!”he said,“so glad! poor young fellow! I wonder what it was that made him so anxious!”

Jerry often talked to himself quite loud enough for me to hear, when we were not moving.

On Jerry's return to the rank, there was a good deal of laughing and chaffing at him for driving hard to the train for an extra fare, as they said, all against his principles; and they wanted to know how much he had pocketed.

“A good deal more than I generally get,”said he, nodding slyly;“what he gave me will keep me in little comforts for several days.”

“Gammon!”said one.

“He's a humbug,”said another;“preaching to us, and then doing the same himself.”

“Look here, mates,”said Jerry,“the gentleman offered me half-a-crown extra, but I didn't take it; 'twas quite pay enough for me to see how glad he was to catch that train; and if Jack and I choose to have a quick run now and then, to please ourselves, that's our business and not yours.”

“Well,”said Larry,“you'll never be a rich man.”

“Most likely not,”said Jerry,“but I don't know that I shall be the less happy for that. I have heard the commandments read a great many times, and I never noticed that any of them said, ‘Thou shalt be rich;’ and there are a good many curious things said in the New Testament about rich men, that I think would make me feel rather queer if I was one of them.”

“If you ever do get rich,”said Governor Grant, looking over his shoulder across the top of his cab,“you'll deserve it, Jerry, and you won't find a curse come with your wealth. As for you, Larry, you'll die poor. You spend too much in whipcord.”

“Well,”said Larry,“what is a fellow to do if his horse won't go without it?”

“You never take the trouble to see if he will go without it; your whip is always going as if you had the St. Vitus' dance in your arm; and if it does not wear you out, it wears your horse out; you know you are always changing your horses; and why? Because you never give them any peace or encouragement.”

“Well, I have not had good luck,”said Larry,“that's where it is.”

“And you never will,”said the Governor.“Good Luck is rather particular who she rides with, and mostly prefers those who have got common sense and a good heart; at least that is my experience.”

Governor Gray turned round again to his newspaper, and the other men went to their cabs.





36　The Sunday Cab


One morning, as Jerry had just put me into the shafts and was fastening the traces, a gentleman walked into the yard.“Your servant, sir,”said Jerry.

“Good morning, Mr. Barker,”said the gentleman.“I should be glad to make some arrangements with you for taking Mrs. Briggs regularly to church on Sunday mornings. We go to the New Church now, and that is rather further than she can walk.”

“Thank you, sir,”said Jerry,“but I have only taken out a six-days' license,(1) and therefore I could not take a fare on a Sunday; it would not be legal.”

“Oh!”said the other,“I did not know yours was a six-days' cab; but of course it would be very easy to alter your license. I would see that you did not lose by it; the fact is, Mrs. Briggs very much prefers you to drive her.”

“I should be glad to oblige the lady, sir, but I had a seven days' license once, and the work was too hard for me, and too hard for my horses. Year in and year out, not a day's rest, and never a Sunday with my wife and children, and never able to go to a place of worship, which I had always been used to do before I took to the driving box; so for the last five years I have only taken a six days' license, and I find it better all the way round.”

“Well, of course,”replied Mr. Briggs,“it is very proper that every person should have rest, and be able to go to church on Sundays, but I should have thought you would not have minded such a short distance for the horse, and only once a day; you would have all the afternoon and evening for yourself, and we are very good customers, you know.”

“Yes, sir, that is true, and I am grateful for all favors, I am sure, and anything that I could do to oblige you, or the lady, I should be proud and happy to do; but I can't give up my Sundays, sir, indeed I can't. I read that God made man, and He made horses and all the other beasts, and as soon as He had made them, He made a day of rest, and bade that all should rest one day in seven; and I think, sir, He must have known what was good for them, and I am sure it is good for me; I am stronger and healthier altogether, now that I have a day of rest; the horses are fresh too, and do not wear up nearly so fast. The six-day drivers all tell me the same, and I have laid by more money in the Savings Bank than ever I did before; and as for the wife and children, sir—why, heart alive! they would not go back to the seven days for all they could see.”

“Oh, very well,”said the gentleman.“Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Barker, any further; I will inquire somewhere else,”and he walked away.

“Well,”says Jerry to me,“we can't help it, Jack, old boy, we must have our Sundays.”

“Polly!”he shouted,“Polly! come here.”

She was there in a minute.

“What is it all about, Jerry?”

“Why, my dear, Mr. Briggs wants me to take Mrs. Briggs to church every Sunday morning. I say I have only a six days' license. He says ‘Get a seven days' license, and I'll make it worth your while,’ and you know, Polly, they are very good customers to us. Mrs. Briggs often goes out shopping for hours, or making calls, and then she pays down fair and honorable like a lady; there's no beating down, or making three hours into two hours and a half, as some folks do; and it is easy work for the horses; not like tearing along to catch trains for people that are always a quarter of an hour too late; and if I don't oblige her in this matter, it is very likely we shall lose them altogether. What do you say, little woman?”

“I say, Jerry,”says she, speaking very slowly,“I say, if Mrs. Briggs would give you a sovereign every Sunday morning I would not have you a seven days' cabman again. We have known what it was to have no Sundays; and now we know what it is to call them our own. Thank God, you earn enough to keep us, though it is sometimes close work to pay for all the oats and hay, the license, and the rent besides; but Harry will soon be earning something, and I would rather struggle on harder than we do, than go back to those horrid times, when you hardly had a minute to look at your own children, and we never could go to a place of worship together, or have a happy, quiet day. God forbid that we should ever turn back to those times; that's what I say, Jerry.”

“And that is just what I told Mr. Briggs, my dear,”said Jerry,“and what I mean to stick to; so don't go and fret yourself, Polly (for she had begun to cry);“I would not go back to the old times if I earned twice as much, so that is settled, little woman. Now cheer up, and I'll be off to the stand.”

Three weeks had passed away after this conversation, and no order had come from Mrs. Briggs; so there was nothing but taking jobs from the stand. Jerry took it to heart a good deal, for of course the work was harder for horse and man; but Polly would always cheer him up and say,“Never mind, father, never, mind:

Do your best,

And Ieave the rest,

'Twill all come right,

Some day or night.”

It soon became known that Jerry had lost his best customer, and for what reason; most of the men said he was a fool, but two or three took his part.

“If workingmen don't stick to their Sunday,”said Truman,“they'll soon have none left; it is every man's right and every beast's right. By God's law we have a day of rest, and by the law of England we have a day of rest; and I say we ought to hold to the rights these laws give us, and keep them for our children.”

“All very well for you religious chaps to talk so,”said Larry,“but I'll turn a shilling when I can. I don't believe in religion, for I don't see that your religious people are any better than the rest.”

“If they are not better,”put in Jerry,“it is because they are not religious. You might as well say that our country's laws are not good because some people break them. If a man gives way to his temper, and speaks evil of his neighbor, and does not pay his debts, he is not religious, I don't care how much he goes to church. If some men are shams and humbugs, that does not make religion untrue. Real religion is the best and truest thing in the world; and the only thing that can make a man really happy, or make the world better.”

“If religion was good for anything,”said Jones,“it would prevent your religious people from making us work on Sundays as you know many of them do, and that's why I say religion is nothing but a sham—why, if it was not for the church and chapel-goers it would be hardly worth while our coming out on a Sunday; but they have their privileges, as they call them, and I go without. I shall expect them to answer for my soul, if I can't get a chance of saving it.”

Several of the men applauded this, till Jerry said:

“That may sound well enough, but it won't do; every man must look after his own soul; you can't lay it at another man's door like a foundling, and expect him to take care of it; don't you see, if you are always sitting on your box waiting for a fare, they will say, ‘If we don't take him, someone else will, and he does not look for any Sunday.’ Of course they don't go to the bottom of it, or they would see if they never came for a cab, it would be no use your standing there; but people don't always like to go to the bottom of things; it may not be convenient to do it; but if you Sunday drivers would all strike for a day of rest, the thing would be done.”

“And what would all the good people do if they could not get to their favorite preachers?”said Larry.

“'tis not for me to lay down plans for other people,”said Jerry,“but if they can't walk so far, they can go to what is nearer; and if it should rain they can put on their mackintoshes as they do on a week-day. If a thing is right, it can be done, and if it is wrong, it can be done without; and a good man will find a way; and that is as true for us cabmen as it is for the church-goers.”




————————————————————

(1) A few years since the annual charge for a cab license was very much reduced, and the difference between the six and seven days' cabs was abolished.





37　The Golden Rule


Two or three weeks after this, as we came into the yard rather late in the evening, Polly came running across the road with the lantern (she always brought it to him if it was not very wet).

“It has all come right, Jerry; Mrs. Briggs sent her servant this afternoon to ask you to take her out to-morrow at eleven o'clock. I said, ‘Yes, I thought so, but we supposed she employed some one else now.’

“‘Well,’ said he, ‘the real fact is, master was put out because Mr. Barker refused to come on Sundays, and he has been trying other cabs, but there's something wrong with them all; some drive too fast, and some too slow, and the mistress says, there is not one of them so nice and clean as yours, and nothing will suit her but Mr. Barker's cab again.’”

Polly was almost out of breath, and Jerry broke out into a merry laugh.

“‘Twill all come right, some day or night.’ you were right, my dear; you generally are. Run in and get the supper, and I'll have Jack's harness off and make him snug and happy in no time.”

After this, Mrs. Briggs wanted Jerry's cab quite as often as before, never, however, on a Sunday; but there came a day when we had Sunday work, and this was how it happened. We had all come home on the Saturday night very tired, and very glad to think that the next day would be all rest, but so it was not to be.

On Sunday morning Jerry was cleaning me in the yard when Polly stepped up to him, looking very full of something.

“What is it?”said Jerry.

“Well, my dear,”she said,“poor Dinah Brown has just had a letter brought to say that her mother is dangerously ill, and that she must go directly if she wishes to see her alive. The place is more than ten miles away from here, out in the country, and she says if she takes the train she should still have four miles to walk; and so weak as she is, and the baby only four weeks old, of course that would be impossible; and she wants to know if you would take her in your cab, and she promises to pay you faithfully as she can get the money.”

“Tut, tut, we'll see about that. It was not the money I was thinking about, but of losing our Sunday; the horses are tired, and I am tired too—that's where it pinches.”

“It pinches all round, for that matter,”said Polly,“for it's only half Sunday without you, but you know we should do to other people as we should like they should do to us; and I know very well what I should like if my mother was dying; and Jerry, dear, I am sure it won't break the Sabbath; for if pulling a poor beast or donkey out of a pit would not spoil it, I am quite sure taking poor Dinah would not do it.”

“Why, Polly, you are as good as the minister, and so, as I've had my Sunday morning sermon early today, you may go and tell Dinah that I'll be ready for her as the clock strikes ten; but stop—just step round to butcher Braydon's with my compliments, and ask him if he would lend me his light trap. I know he never uses it on the Sunday, and it would make a wonderful difference to the horse.”

Away she went, and soon returned, saying that he could have the trap and welcome.

“All right,”said he,“now put me up a bit of bread and cheese, and I'll be back in the afternoon as soon as I can.”

“And I'll have the meat pie ready for an early tea instead of for dinner,”said Polly; and away she went, while he made his preparations to the tune of“Polly, the woman and no mistake,”of which tune he was very fond.

I was selected for the journey, and at ten o'clock we started, in a light, high-wheeled gig, which ran so easily that after the four-wheeled cab it seemed like nothing.

It was a fine May day, and as soon as we were out of the town, the sweet air, the smell of the fresh grass, and the soft country roads were as pleasant as they used to be in the old times, and I soon began to feel quite fresh.

Dinah's family lived in a small farmhouse, up a green lane, close by a meadow, with some fine shady trees: there were two cows feeding in it. A young man asked Jerry to bring his trap into the meadow, and he would tie me up in the cowshed; he wished he had a better stable to offer.

“If your cows would not be offended,”said Jerry,“there is nothing my horse would like so well as to have an hour or two in your beautiful meadow; he's quiet, and it would be a rare treat for him.”

“Do, and welcome,”said the young man,“the best we have is at your service for your kindness to my sister; we shall be having some dinner in an hour, and I hope you'll come in, though with mother so ill, we are all out of sorts in the house.”

Jerry thanked him kindly, but said as he had some dinner with him, there was nothing he should like so well as walking about in the meadow.

When my harness was taken off, I did not know what I should do first—whether to eat the grass, or roll over on my back, or lie down and rest, or have a gallop across the meadow out of sheer spirits at being free; and I did all by turns. Jerry seemed to be quite as happy as I was; he sat down by a bank under a shady tree, and listened to the birds, then he sang himself, and read out of the little brown book he is so fond of, then wandered round the meadow and down by a little brook, where he picked the fiowers and the hawthorn, and tied them up with long sprays of ivy; then he gave me a good feed of the oats which he had brought with him; but the time seemed all too short—I had not been in a field since I left poor Ginger at Earlshall.

We came home gently, and Jerry's first words were as we came into the yard,“Well, Polly, I have not lost my Sunday after all, for the birds were singing hymns in every bush, and I joined in the service; and as for Jack, he was like a young colt.”

When he handed Dolly the fiowers, she jumped about for joy.





38　 Dolly and a Real Gentleman


The winter came in early, with a great deal of cold and wet. There was snow, or sleet, or rain, almost every day for weeks, changing only for keen driving winds, or sharp frosts. The horses all felt it very much. When it is a dry cold, a couple of good thick rugs will keep the warmth in us; but when it is soaking rain, they soon get wet through and are no good. Some of the drivers had a waterproof cover to throw over, which was a fine thing; but some of the men were so poor that they could not protect either themselves or their horses, and many of them suffered very much that winter. When we horses had worked half the day we went to our dry stables, and could rest; whilst they had to sit on their boxes, sometimes staying out as late as one or two o'clock in the morning, if they had a party to wait for.

When the streets were slippery with frost or snow, that was the worst of all for us horses; one mile of such traveling, with a weight to draw, and no firm footing, would take more out of us than four on a good road; every nerve and muscle of our bodies is on the strain to keep our balance; and added to this, the fear of falling is more exhausting than anything else. If the roads are very bad indeed, our shoes are roughed, but that makes us feel nervous at first.

When the weather was very bad, many of the men would go and sit in the tavern close by, and get some one to watch for them; but they often lost a fare in that way, and could not, as Jerry said, be there without spending money. He never went to the“Rising Sun;”there was a coffee shop near, where he now and then went—or he bought of an old man who came to our rank with tins of hot coffee and pies. It was his opinion that spirits and beer made a man colder afterwards, and that dry clothes, good food, cheerfulness, and a comfortable wife at home, were the best things to keep a cabman warm. Polly always supplied him with something to eat when he could not get home, and sometimes he would see little Dolly peeping from the corner of the street, to make sure if“father”was on the stand. If she saw him, she would run off at full speed and soon come back with something in a tin or basket—some hot soup or pudding that Polly had ready. It was wonderful how such a little thing could get safely across the street, often thronged with horses and carriages; but she was a brave little maid, and felt it quite an honor to bring“father's first course,”as he used to call it. She was a general favorite on the stand, and there was not a man who would not have seen her safely across the street, if Jerry had not been able to do it.

One cold, windy day, Dolly had brought Jerry a basin of something hot, and was standing by him while he ate it. He had scarcely begun when a gentleman, walking toward us very fast, held up his umbrella. Jerry touched his hat in return, gave the basin to Dolly, and was taking off my cloth, when the gentleman, hastening up, cried out,“No, no, finish your soup, my friend; I have not much time to spare, but I can wait till you have done, and set your little girl safe on the pavement.”So saying, he seated himself in the cab. Jerry thanked him kindly, and came back to Dolly.

“There, Dolly, that's a gentleman; that's a real gentleman, Dolly; he has got time and thought for the comfort of a poor cabman and a little girl.”

Jerry finished his soup, set the child across, and then took his orders to drive to“Clapham Rise.”Several times after that the same gentleman took our cab. I think he was very fond of dogs and horses, for whenever we took him to his own door, two or three dogs would come bounding out to meet him. Sometimes he came round and patted me, saying in his quiet, pleasant way,“This horse has got a good master, and he deserves it.”It was a very rare thing for any one to notice the horse that had been working for him. I have known ladies to do it now and then, and this gentleman, and one or two others have given me a pat and a kind word; but ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would as soon think of patting the steam engine that drew the train.

The gentleman was not young, and there was a forward stoop in his shoulders as if he was always going at something. His lips were thin, and close shut, though they had a very pleasant smile; his eye was keen, and there was something in his jaw and the motion of his head that made one think he was very determined in anything he set about. His voice was pleasant and kind; any horse would trust that voice, though it was just as decided as anything else about him.

One day, he and another gentleman took our cab; they stopped at a shop in R—Street, and whilst his friend went in, he stood at the door. A little ahead of us on the other side of the street, a cart with two very fine horses was standing before some wine vaults; the carter was not with them, and I cannot tell how long they had been standing, but they seemed to think they had waited long enough, and began to move off. Before they had gone many paces, the carter came running out and caught them. He seemed furious at their having moved, and with whip and rein punished them brutally, even beating them about the head. Our gentleman saw it all and stepping quickly across the street, said in a decided voice:

“If you don't stop that directly, I'll have you arrested for leaving your horses, and for brutal conduct.”

The man, who had clearly been drinking, poured forth some abusive language, but he left off knocking the horses about, and, taking the reins, got into his cart; meantime our friend had quietly taken a notebook from his pocket, and, looking at the name and address painted on the cart, he wrote something down.

“What do you want with that?”growled the carter, as he cracked his whip and was moving on. A nod and a grim smile, was the only answer he got.

On returning to the cab, our friend was joined by his companion, who said laughingly,“I should have thought, Wright, you had enough business of your own to look after, without troubling yourself about other people's horses and servants.”

Our friend stood still for a moment, and throwing his head a little back said,“Do you know why this world is as bad as it is?”

“No,”said the other.

“Then I'll tell you. It is because people think only about their own business, and won't trouble themselves to stand up for the oppressed, nor bring the wrong-doer to light. I never see a wicked thing like this without doing what I can, and many a master has thanked me for letting him know how his horses have been used.”

“I wish there were more gentlemen like you, sir,”said Jerry,“for they are wanted badly enough in this city.”

After this we continued our journey, and as they got out of the cab, our friend was saying,“My doctrine is this, that if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop, and do nothing, we make ourselves sharers in the guilt.”





39　 Seedy Sam


I should say that for a cab horse I was very well off indeed; my driver was my owner, and it was his interest to treat me well and not overwork me, even had he not been so good a man as he was; but there were a great many horses which belonged to the large cab-owners, who let them out to their drivers for so much money a day. As the horses did not belong to these men, the only thing they thought of was how to get their money out of them: first, to pay the master, and then to provide for their own living, and a dreadful time some of these horses had of it. Of course I understood but little, but it was often talked over on the stand, and the Governor, who was a kind-hearted man, and fond of horses, would sometimes speak up if one came in very much jaded or ill-used.

One day, a shabby, miserable-looking driver, who went by the name of“Seedy Sam,”brought in his horse looking dreadfully beat, and the Governor said:

“You and your horse look more fit for the police station than for this rank.”

The man fiung his tattered rug over the horse, turned full round upon the Governor, and said in a voice that sounded almost desperate:

“If the police have any business with the matter, it ought to be with the masters who charge us so much, or with the fares that are fixed so low. If a man has to pay eighteen shillings a day for the use of a cab and two horses, as many of us have to do in the season, and must make that up before we earn a penny for ourselves—I say, 'tis more than hard work; nine shillings a day to get out of each horse, before you begin to get your own living; you know that's true, and if the horses don't work we must starve, and I and my children have known what that is before now. I've six of 'em, and only one earns anything. I am on the stand fourteen or sixteen hours a day, and I haven't had a Sunday these ten or twelve weeks; you know, Skinner never gives a day if he can help it, and if I don't work hard, tell me who does! I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed, how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock a week ago to pay Skinner, and I shall never see it again.”

Some of the other drivers stood round nodding their heads, and saying he was right. The man went on:

“You that have your own horses and cabs, or drive for good masters, have a chance of getting on, and a chance of doing right; I haven't. We can't charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile radius. This very morning I had to go a clear six miles and only took three shillings. I could not get a return fare, and had to come all the way back; there's twelve miles for the horse and three shillings for me. After that I had a three-mile fare, and there were bags and boxes enough to have brought in a good many two-pences if they had been put outside; but you know how people do; all that could be piled up inside on the front seat were put in, and three heavy boxes went on the top, that was sixpence, and the fare one and sixpence; then I got a return for a shilling; now that makes eighteen miles for the horse and six shillings for me; there's three shillings still for that horse to earn, and nine shillings for the afternoon horse before I touch a penny. Of course it is not always so bad as that, but you know it often is, and I say 'tis a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a beast is downright tired there's nothing but the whip that will keep his legs agoing—you can't help yourself—you must put your wife and children before the horse; the masters must look to that, we can't. I don't ill-use my horse for the sake of it; none of you can say I do. There's wrong lays somewhere—never a day's rest—never a quiet hour with the wife and children. I often feel like an old man, though I'm only forty-five. You know how quick some of the gentry are to suspect us of cheating and overcharging; why, they stand with their purses in their hands, counting it over to a penny, and looking at us as if we were pickpockets. I wish some of 'em had got to sit on my box sixteen hours a day, and get a living out of it, and eighteen shillings beside, and that in all weathers; they would not be so uncommon particular never to give us a sixpence over or to cram all the luggage inside. Of course some of 'em tip us pretty handsome now and then, or else we could not live, but you can't depend upon that.”

The men who stood round much approved this speech, and one of them said,“It is desperate hard, and if a man sometimes does what is wrong, it is no wonder; and if he gets a dram too much, who's to blow him up?”

Jerry had taken no part in this conversation, but I never saw his face look so sad before. The Governor had stood with both his hands in his pockets; now he took his handkerchief out of his hat, and wiped his forehead.

“You've beaten me, Sam,”he said,“for it's all true, and I won't cast it up to you any more about the police; it was the look in that horse's eye that came over me. It is hard lines for man, and it is hard lines for beast, and who's to mend it I don't know; but anyway you might tell the poor beast that you were sorry to take it out of him in that way. Sometimes a kind word is all we can Give 'em, poor brutes, and 'tis wonderful what they do understand.”

A few mornings after this talk, a new man came on the stand with Sam's cab.

“Halloo!”said one,“what's up with Seedy Sam?”

“He's ill in bed,”said the man.“He was taken last night in the yard, and could scarcely crawl home. His wife sent a boy this morning to say his father was in a high fever and could not get out; so I'm here instead.”

The next morning the same man came again.

“How is Sam?”inquired the Governor.

“He's gone,”said the man.

“What, gone? You don't mean to say he's dead?”

“Just snuffed out,”said the other;“he died at four o'clock this morning; all yesterday he was raving—raving about Skinner, and having no Sundays. ‘I never had a Sunday's rest,’ these were his last words.”

No one spoke for a while, and then the Governor said,“I'll tell you what, mates, this is a warning for us.”





40　 Poor Ginger


One day, while our cab and many others were waiting outside one of the Parks, where music was playing, a shabby old cab drove up beside ours. The horse was an old worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and bones that showed plainly through it. The knees knuckled over, and the forelegs were very unsteady. I had been eating some hay, and the wind rolled a little lock of it that way, and the poor creature put out her long thin neck and picked it up, and then turned round and looked about for more. There was a hopeless look in the dull eye that I could not help noticing, and then, as I was thinking where I had seen that horse before, she looked full at me and said,“Black Beauty, is that you?”

It was Ginger! but how changed! The beautifully arched and glossy neck was now straight and lank, and fallen in; the clean straight legs and delicate fetlocks were swelled; the joints were grown out of shape with hard work; the face that was once so full of spirit and life, was now full of suffering, and I could tell by the heaving of her sides, and her frequent cough, how bad her breath was.

Our drivers were standing together a little way off, so I sidled up to her a step or two, that we might have a little quiet talk. It was a sad tale that she had to tell.

After a twelvemonth's run off at Earlshall, she was considered to be fit for work again, and was sold to a gentleman. For a little while she got on very well, but after a longer gallop than usual the old strain returned, and after being rested and doctored she was again sold. In this way she changed hands several times, but always getting lower down.

“And so at last,”said she,“I was bought by a man who keeps a number of cabs and horses, and lets them out. You look well off, and I am glad of it, but I could not tell you what my life has been. When they found out my weakness, they said I was not worth what they gave for me, and that I must go into one of the low cabs, and just be used up; that is what they are doing, whipping and working with never one thought of what I suffer; they paid for me, and must get it out of me, they say. The man who hires me now pays a deal of money to the owner every day, and so he has to get it out of me too; and so it's all the week round and round, with never a Sunday rest.”

I said,“You used to stand up for yourself if you were ill-used.”

“Ah!”she said,“I did once, but it's no use; men are strongest, and if they are cruel and have no feeling, there is nothing that we can do, but just bear it, bear it on and on to the end. I wish the end was come, I wish I was dead. I have seen dead horses, and I am sure they do not suffer pain; I wish I may drop down dead at my work, and not be sent off to the knackers.”

I was very much troubled, and I put my nose up to hers, but I could say nothing to comfort her. I think she was pleased to see me, for she said,“You are the only friend I ever had.”

Just then her driver came up, and with a tug at her mouth backed her out of the line and drove off, leaving me very sad indeed.

A short time after this a cart with a dead horse in it passed our cabstand. The head hung out of the cart-tail, the lifeless tongue was slowly dropping with blood; and the sunken eyes! but I can't speak of them, the sight was too dreadful. It was a chestnut horse with a long, thin neck. I saw a white streak down the forehead. I believe it was Ginger; I hoped it was, for then her troubles would be over. Oh! if men were more merciful, they would shoot us before we came to such misery.





41　 The Butcher


I saw a great deal of trouble amongst the horses in London, and much of it that might have been prevented by a little common sense. We horses do not mind hard work if we are treated reasonably; and I am sure there are many driven by quite poor men who have a happier life than I had when I used to go in the Countess of W—'s carriage, with my silver-mounted harness and high feeding.

It often went to my heart to see how the little ponies were used, straining along with heavy loads, or staggering under heavy blows from some low cruel boy. Once I saw a little gray pony with a thick mane and a pretty head, and so much like Merrylegs, that if I had not been in harness, I should have neighed to him. He was doing his best to pull a heavy cart, while a strong rough boy was cutting him under the belly with his whip, and chucking cruelly at his little mouth. Could it be Merrylegs? It was just like him; but then Mr. Blomefield was never to sell him, and I think he would not do it; but this might have been quite as good a little fellow, and had as happy a place when he was young.

I often noticed the great speed at which butchers' horses were made to go, though I did not know why it was so, till one day when we had to wait some time in St. John's Wood. There was a butcher's shop next door, and, as we were standing, a butcher's cart came dashing up at a great pace. The horse was hot, and much exhausted; he hung his head down, while his heaving sides and trembling legs showed how hard he had been driven. The lad jumped out of the cart and was getting the basket, when the master came out of the shop much displeased. After looking at the horse, he turned angrily to the lad:

“How many times shall I tell you not to drive in this way? You ruined the last horse and broke his wind, and you are going to ruin this in the same way. If you were not my own son, I would dismiss you on the spot; it is a disgrace to have a horse brought to the shop in a condition like that; you are liable to be taken up by the police for such driving, and if you are, you need not look to me for bail, for I have spoken to you till I'm tired; you must look out for yourself.”

During this speech, the boy had stood by, sullen and dogged, but when his father ceased, he broke out angrily. It wasn't his fault, and he wouldn't take the blame, he was only going by orders all the time.

“You always say, ‘Now be quick; now look sharp!’ and when I go to the houses, one wants a leg of mutton for an early dinner, and I must be back with it in a quarter of an hour; another cook had forgotten to order the beef, I must go and fetch it and be back in no time, or the mistress will scold; and the housekeeper says they have company coming unexpectedly and must have some chops sent up directly; and the lady at No. 4, in the Crescent, never orders her dinner till the meat comes in for lunch, and it's nothing but hurry, hurry, all the time. If the gentry would think of what they want, and order their meat the day before, there need not be this blowup!”

“I wish to goodness they would,”said the butcher;“'twould save me a wonderful deal of harass, and I could suit my customers much better if I knew beforehand—but there—what's the use of talking—who ever thinks of a butcher's convenience, or a butcher's horse? Now then, take him in, and look to him well: mind, he does not go out again today, and if anything else is wanted, you must carry it yourself in the basket.”With that he went in, and the horse was led away.

But all boys are not cruel. I have seen some as fond of their pony or donkey as if it had been a favorite dog, and the little creatures have worked away as cheerfully and willingly for their young drivers as I work for Jerry. It may be hard work sometimes, but a friend's hand and voice make it easy.

There was a young coster-boy who came up our street with greens and potatoes; he had an old pony, not very handsome, but the cheerfullest and pluckiest little thing I ever saw, and to see how fond those two were of each other, was a treat. The pony followed his master like a dog, and when he got into his cart, would trot off without a whip or a word, and rattle down the street as merrily as if he had come out of the Queen's stables. Jerry liked the boy, and called him“Prince Charlie,”for he said he would make a king of drivers some day.

There was an old man, too, who used to come up our street with a little coal cart; he wore a coal-heaver's hat, and looked rough and black. He and his old horse used to plod together along the street, like two good partners who understood each other; the horse would stop of his own accord at the doors where they took coal of him; he used to keep one ear bent towards his master. The old man's cry could be heard up the street long before he came near. I never knew what he said, but the children called him“Old Ba-a-ar Hoo,”for it sounded like that. Polly took her coal off him, and was very friendly, and Jerry said it was a comfort to think how happy an old horse might be in a poor place.





42　 The Election


As we came into the yard one afternoon, Polly came out:“Jerry! I've had Mr. B—here asking about your vote, and he wants to hire your cab for the election; he will call for an answer.”

“Well, Polly, you may say that my cab will be otherwise engaged; I should not like to have it pasted over with their great bills, and as to make Jack and Captain race about to the public-houses to bring up half-drunken voters, why I think 'twould be an insult to the horses. No, I shan't do it.”

“I suppose you'll vote for the gentleman? He said he was of your politics.”

“So he is in some things, but I shall not vote for him, Polly; you know what his trade is?”

“Yes.”

“Well, a man who gets rich by that trade may be all very well in some ways, but he is blind as to what working men want; I could not in my conscience send him up to make the laws. I dare say they'll be angry, but every man must do what he thinks to be the best for his country.”

On the morning before the election, Jerry was putting me into the shafts, when Dolly came into the yard, sobbing and crying, with her little blue frock and white pinafore spattered all over with mud.

“Why, Dolly, what is the matter?”

“Those naughty boys,”she sobbed,“have thrown the dirt all over me, and called me a little ragga—ragga—”

“They called her a little blue raggamuffin, father,”said Harry, who ran in looking very angry;“but I have given it to them; they won't insult my sister again. I have given them a thrashing they will remember. A set of cowardly, rascally orange blackguards!”

Jerry kissed the child and said,“Run in to mother, my pet, and tell her I think you had better stay at home today and help her.”

Then turning gravely to Harry:

“My boy, I hope you will always defend your sister, and give anybody who insults her a good thrashing—that is as it should be; but mind, I won't have any election blackguarding on my premises. There are as many blue blackguards as there are orange, and as many white as there are purple, or any other color, and I won't have any of my family mixed up with it. Even women and children are ready to quarrel for the sake of a color, and not one in ten of them knows what it is about.”

“Why, father, I thought blue was for Liberty.”

“My boy, Liberty does not come from colors, they only show party, and all the liberty you can get out of them is liberty to get drunk at other people's expense, liberty to ride to the poll in a dirty old cab, liberty to abuse anyone that does not wear your color, and to shout yourself hoarse at what you only half understand—that's your liberty!”

“Oh, father, you are laughing.”

“No, Harry, I am serious, and I am ashamed to see how men go on that ought to know better. An election is a very serious thing; at least it ought to be, and every man ought to vote according to his conscience, and let his neighbor do the same.”





43　 A Friend in Need


The election day came at last; there was no lack of work for Jerry and me. First came a stout puffy gentleman with a carpet bag; he wanted to go to the Bishopsgate Station; then we were called by a party who wished to be taken to the Regent's Park; and next we were wanted in a side street where a timid anxious old lady was waiting to be taken to the bank: there we had to stop to take her back again, and just as we had set her down, a red-faced gentleman with a handful of papers came running up out of breath, and before Jerry could get down, he had opened the door, popped himself in, and called out,“Bow Street Police Station, quick!”so off we went with him, and when after another turn or two we came back, there was no other cab on the stand. Jerry put on my nose-bag, for as he said,“We must eat when we can on such days as these; so munch away, Jack, and make the best of your time, old boy.”

I found I had a good feed of crushed oats wetted up with a little bran; this would be a treat any day, but was specially refreshing then. Jerry was so thoughtful and kind—what horse would not do his best for such a master? Then he took out one of Polly's meat pies, and standing near me, he began to eat it. The streets were very full, and the cabs with the Candidates' colors on them were dashing about through the crowd as if life and limb were of no consequence; we saw two people knocked down that day, and one was a woman. The horses were having a bad time of it, poor things! but the voters inside thought nothing of that, many of them were half drunk, hurrahing out of the cab windows if their own party came by. It was the first election I had seen, and I don't want to be in another, though I have heard things are better now.

Jerry and I had not eaten many mouthfuls before a poor young woman, carrying a heavy child, came along the street. She was looking this way, and that way, and seemed quite bewildered. Presently she made her way up to Jerry, and asked if he could tell her the way to St. Thomas's Hospital, and how far it was to get there. She had come from the country that morning, she said, in a market cart; she did not know about the election and was quite a stranger in London. She had got an order for the Hospital for her little boy. The child was crying with a feeble, pining cry.

“Poor little fellow!”she said,“he suffers a deal of pain; he is four years old and can't walk any more than a baby; but the doctor said if I could get him into the hospital, he might get well; pray, sir, how far is it? and which way is it?”

“Why, missis,”said Jerry,“you can't get there walking through crowds like this! Why, it is three miles away, and that child is heavy.”

“Yes, bless him, he is, but I am strong, thank God, and if I knew the way, I think I should get on somehow: please tell me the way.”

“You can't do it,”said Jerry,“you might be knocked down and the child be run over. Now, look here, just get into this cab, and I'll drive you safe to the hospital. Don't you see the rain is coming on?”

“No, sir, no, I can't do that, thank you, I have only just money enough to get back with. Please tell me the way.”

“Look you here, missis,”said Jerry,“I've got a wife and dear children at home, and I know a father's feelings: now get you into that cab, and I'll take you there for nothing; I'd be ashamed of myself to let a woman and a sick child run a risk like that.”

“Heaven bless you!”said the woman, and burst into tears.

“There, there, cheer up, my dear, I'll soon take you there; come, let me put you inside.”

As Jerry went to open the door, two men, with colors in their hats and buttonholes, ran up, calling out,“Cab!”

“Engaged,”cried Jerry; but one of the men, pushing past the woman, sprang into the cab, followed by the other. Jerry looked as stern as a policeman:“This cab is already engaged, gentlemen, by that lady.”

“Lady!”said one of them;“oh! she can wait; our business is very important; besides we were in first—it is our right, and we shall stay in.”

A droll smile came over Jerry's face as he shut the door upon them.“All right, gentlemen, pray stay in as long as it suits you; I can wait while you rest yourselves.”and turning his back upon them, he walked up to the young woman, who was standing near me.“They'll soon be gone,”he said, laughing;“don't trouble yourself, my dear.”

And they soon were gone, for when they understood Jerry's dodge, they got out, calling him all sorts of bad names, and blustering about his number, and getting a summons. After this little stoppage we were soon on our way to the hospital, going as much as possible through by-streets. Jerry rang the great bell, and helped the young woman out.

“Thank you a thousand times,”she said;“I could never have got here alone.”

“You're kindly welcome, and I hope the dear child will soon be better.”

He watched her go in at the door, and gently he said to himself,“Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these.”Then he patted my neck, which was always his way when anything pleased him.

The rain was now coming down fast, and just as we were leaving the hospital, the door opened again, and the porter called out,“Cab!”We stopped, and a lady came down the steps. Jerry seemed to know her at once; she put back her veil and said,“Barker! Jeremiah Barker! is it you? I am very glad to find you here; you are just the friend I want, for it is very difficult to get a cab in this part of London today.”

“I shall be proud to serve you, ma'am, I am right glad I happened to be here; where may I take you to, ma'am?”

“To the Paddington Station, and then if we are in good time, as I think we shall be, you shall tell me all about Mary and the children.”

We got to the station in good time, and being under shelter, the lady stood a good while talking to Jerry. I found she had been Polly's mistress, and after many inquiries about her, she said:

“How do you find the cab work suits you in winter? I know Mary was rather anxious about you last year.”

“Yes, ma'am, she was; I had a bad cough that followed me up quite into the warm weather, and when I am kept out late, she does worry herself a good deal. You see, ma'am, it is all hours and all weathers, and that does try a man's constitution; but I am getting on pretty well, and I should feel quite lost if I had not horses to look after. I was brought up to it, and I am afraid that I should not do so well at anything else.”

“Well, Barker,”she said,“it would be a great pity that you should seriously risk your health in this work, not only for your own, but for Mary's and the children's sake; there are many places where good drivers or good grooms are wanted; and if ever you think you ought to give up this cab work, let me know.”

Then sending some kind messages to Mary, she put something into his hand, saying,“There is five shillings each for the two children. Mary will know how to spend it.”

Jerry thanked her and seemed much pleased, and turning out of the station, we at last reached home, and I, at least, was tired.





44　 Old Captain and His Successor


Captain and I were great friends. He was a noble old fellow, and he was very good company. I never thought that he would have to leave his home and go down the hill, but his turn came; and this was how it happened. I was not there, but I heard all about it.

He and Jerry had taken a party to the great railway station over London Bridge, and were coming back, somewhere between the Bridge and the Monument, when Jerry saw a brewer's empty dray coming along, drawn by two powerful horses. The drayman was lashing his horses with his heavy whip; the dray was light, and they started off at a furious rate; the man had no control over them, and the street was full of traffic; one young girl was knocked down and run over, and the next moment they dashed up against our cab; both the wheels were torn off, and the cab was thrown over. Captain was dragged down, the shafts splintered, and one of them ran into his side. Jerry too was thrown, but was only bruised; nobody could tell how he escaped, he always said 'twas a miracle. When poor Captain was got up, he was found to be very much cut and knocked about. Jerry led him home gently, and a sad sight it was to see the blood soaking into his white coat, and dropping from his side and shoulder. The drayman was proved to be very drunk, and was fined, and the brewer had to pay damages to our master; but there was no one to pay damages to poor Captain.

The farrier and Jerry did the best they could to ease his pain, and make him comfortable. The fiy had to be mended, and for several days I did not go out, and Jerry earned nothing. The first time we went to the stand after the accident, the Governor came up to hear how Captain was.

“He'll never get over it,”said Jerry,“at least not for my work, so the farrier said this morning. He says he may do for carting, and that sort of work. It has put me out very much. Carting, indeed! I've seen what horses come to at that work round London. I only wish all the drunkards could be put in a lunatic asylum, instead of being allowed to run foul of sober people. If they would break their own bones, and smash their own carts, and lame their own horses, that would be their own affair, and we might let them alone, but it seems to me that the innocent always suffer; and then they talk about compensation! You can't make compensation—there's all the trouble, and vexation, and loss of time, besides losing a good horse that's like an old friend—it's nonsense talking of compensation! If there's one devil that I should like to see in the bottomless pit more than another, it's the drink devil.”

“I say, Jerry,”said the Governor,“you are treading pretty hard on my toes, you know; I'm not so good as you are, more shame for me, I wish I was.”

“Well,”said Jerry,“why don't you cut with it, Governor? You are too good a man to be the slave of such a thing.”

“I'm a great fool, Jerry, but I tried once for two days, and I thought I should have died; how did you do it?”

“I had hard work at it for several weeks; you see, I never did get drunk, but I found that I was not my own master, and that when the craving came on, it was hard work to say ‘no.’ I saw that one of us must knock under—the drink devil, or Jerry Barker, and I said that it should not be Jerry Barker, God helping me: but it was a struggle, and I wanted all the help I could get, for till I tried to break the habit, I did not know how strong it was; but then Polly took such pains that I should have good food, and when the craving came on, I used to get a cup of coffee, or some peppermint, or read a bit in my book, and that was a help to me: sometimes I had to say over and over to myself, ‘Give up the drink or lose your soul! Give up the drink or break Polly's heart!’ But thanks be to God, and my dear wife, my chains were broken, and now for ten years I have not tasted a drop, and never wish for it.”

“I've a great mind to try at it,”said Grant,“for 'tis a poor thing not to be one's own master.”

“Do, Governor, do, you'll never repent it, and what a help it would be to some of the poor fellows in our rank if they saw you do without it. I know there's two or three would like to keep out of that tavern if they could.”

At first Captain seemed to do well, but he was a very old horse, and it was only his wonderful constitution, and Jerry's care, that had kept him up at the cab-work so long; now he broke down very much. The farrier said he might mend up enough to sell for a few pounds, but Jerry said, no! a few pounds got by selling a good old servant into hard work and misery, would canker all the rest of his money, and he thought the kindest thing he could do for the fine old fellow would be to put a sure bullet through his head, and then he would never suffer more; for he did not know where to find a kind master for the rest of his days.

The day after this was decided, Harry took me to the forge for some new shoes; when I returned, Captain was gone. I and the family all felt it very much.

Jerry had now to look out for another horse, and he soon heard of one through an acquaintance who was under-groom in a nobleman's stables. He was a valuable young horse, but he had run away, smashed into another carriage, fiung his lordship out, and so cut and blemished himself that he was no longer fit for a gentleman's stables, and the coachman had orders to look round, and sell him as well as he could.

“I can do with high spirits,”said Jerry,“if a horse is not vicious or hard-mouthed.”

“There is not a bit of vice in him,”said the man,“his mouth is very tender, and I think myself that was the cause of the accident; you see he had just been clipped, and the weather was bad, and he had not had exercise enough, and when he did go out, he was as full of spring as a balloon. Our governor (the coachman, I mean) had him harnessed in as tight and strong as he could, with the martingale, and the bearing rein, a very sharp curb, and the reins put in at the bottom bar; it is my belief that it made the horse mad, being tender in the mouth and so full of spirit.”

“Likely enough; I'll come and see him,”said Jerry.

The next day, Hotspur—that was his name—came home; he was a fine, brown horse, without a white hair in him, as tall as Captain, with a very handsome head, and only five years old. I gave him a friendly greeting by way of good fellowship, but did not ask him any questions. The first night he was very restless; instead of lying down, he kept jerking his halter rope up and down through the ring, and knocking the block about against the manger so that I could not sleep. However, the next day, after five or six hours in the cab, he came in quiet and sensible. Jerry patted and talked to him a good deal, and very soon they understood each other, and Jerry said that with an easy bit, and plenty of work, he would be as gentle as a lamb; and that it was an ill wind that blew nobody good, for if his lordship had lost a hundred-guinea favorite, the cabman had gained a good horse with all his strength in him.

Hotspur thought it a great come down to be a cab-horse, and was disgusted at standing in the rank, but he confessed to me at the end of the week that an easy mouth, and a free head made up for a great deal, and, after all, the work was not so degrading as having one's head and tail fastened to each other at the saddle. In fact, he settled in well, and Jerry liked him very much.





45　 Jerry's New Year


Christmas and the New Year are very merry times for some people; but for cabmen and cabmen's horses it is no holiday, though it may be a harvest. There are so many parties, balls, and places of amusement open, that the work is hard and often late. Sometimes driver and horse have to wait for hours in the rain or frost, shivering with the cold, while the merry people within are dancing away to the music. I wonder if the beautiful ladies ever think of the weary cabman waiting on his box, and his patient beast standing, till his legs get stiff with cold.

I had now most of the evening work, as I was well accustomed to standing, and Jerry was also more afraid of Hotspur taking cold. We had a great deal of late work in the Christmas week, and Jerry's cough was bad; but however late we were, Polly sat up for him, and came out with the lantern to meet him, looking anxious and troubled.

On the evening of the New Year, we had to take two gentlemen to a house in one of the West End Squares. We set them down at nine o'clock and were told to come again at eleven,“But,”said one of them,“as it is a card party, you may have to wait a few minutes, but don't be late.”

As the clock struck eleven we were at the door, for Jerry was always punctual. The clock chimed the quarters—one, two, three, and then struck twelve, but the door did not open.

The wind had been very changeable, with squalls of rain during the day, but now it came on sharp, driving sleet, which seemed to come all the way round; it was very cold, and there was no shelter. Jerry got off his box and came and pulled one of my cloths a little more over my neck; then he took a turn or two up and down, stamping his feet; then he began to beat his arms, but that set him off coughing; so he opened the cab door and sat at the bottom with his feet on the pavement, and was a little sheltered. Still the clock chimed the quarters, and no one came. At half-past twelve, he rang the bell and asked the servant if he would be wanted that night.

“Oh! yes, you'll be wanted safe enough,”said the man,“you must not go, it will soon be over,”and again Jerry sat down, but his voice was so hoarse I could hardly hear him.

At a quarter past one the door opened, and the two gentlemen came out; they got into the cab without a word, and told Jerry where to drive, that was nearly two miles. My legs were numb with cold, and I thought I should have stumbled. When the men got out they never said they were sorry to have kept us waiting so long, but were angry at the charge: however, as Jerry never charged more than was his due, so he never took less, and they had to pay for the two hours and a quarter waiting; but it was hard-earned money to Jerry.

At last we got home; he could hardly speak, and his cough was dreadful. Polly asked no questions, but opened the door and held the lantern for him.

“Can't I do something?”she said.

“Yes, get Jack something warm, and then boil me some gruel.”

This was said in a hoarse whisper; he could hardly get his breath, but he gave me a rub down as usual, and even went up into the hayloft for an extra bundle of straw for my bed. Polly brought me a warm mash that made me comfortable, and then they locked the door.

It was late the next morning before anyone came, and then it was only Harry. He cleaned us and fed us, and swept out the stalls, then he put the straw back again as if it was Sunday. He was very still, and neither whistled nor sang. At noon he came again, and gave us our food and water: this time Dolly came with him; she was crying, and I could gather from what they said that Jerry was dangerously ill, and the doctor said it was a bad case. So two days passed, and there was great trouble indoors. We only saw Harry and sometimes Dolly. I think she came for company, for Polly was always with Jerry, and he had to be kept very quiet.

On the third day, while Harry was in the stable, a tap came at the door, and Governor Grant came in.

“I wouldn't go to the house, my boy,”he said,“but I want to know how your father is.”

“He is very bad,”said Harry,“he can't be much worse; they call it ‘bronchitis;’ the doctor thinks it will turn one way or another tonight.”

“That's bad, very bad,”said Grant, shaking his head;“I know two men who died of that last week; it takes 'em off in no time; but whilst there's life there's hope, so you must keep up your spirits.”

“Yes,”said Harry quickly,“and the doctor said that father had a better chance than most men, because he didn't drink. He said yesterday the fever was so high that if father had been a drinking man it would have burned him up like a piece of paper; but I believe he thinks he will get over it; don't you think he will, Mr. Grant?”

The Governor looked puzzled.

“If there's any rule that good men should get over these things, I'm sure he will, my boy; he's the best man I know. I'll look in early to-morrow.”

Early next morning he was there.

“Well?”said he.

“Father is better,”said Harry.“Mother hopes he will get over it.”

“Thank God!”said the Governor,“and now you must keep him warm, and keep his mind easy, and that brings me to the horses; you see, Jack will be all the better for the rest of a week or two in a warm stable, and you can easily take him a turn up and down the street to stretch his legs; but this young one, if he does not get work, he will soon be all up on end, as you may say, and will be rather too much for you; and when he does go out, there'll be an accident.”

“It is like that now,”said Harry,“I have kept him short of corn, but he's so full of spirit I don't know what to do with him.”

“Just so,”said Grant.“Now look here, will you tell your mother that if she is agreeable I will come for him every day till something is arranged, and take him for a good spell of work, and whatever he earns I'll bring your mother half of it, and that will help with the horses' feed. Your father is in a good club, I know, but that won't keep the horses, and they'll be eating their heads off all this time; I'll come at noon and hear what she says,”and without waiting for Harry's thanks, he was gone.

At noon I think he went and saw Polly, for he and Harry came to the stable together, harnessed Hotspur and took him out.

For a week or more he came for Hotspur, and when Harry thanked him or said anything about his kindness he laughed it off, saying it was all good luck for him, for his horses were wanting a little rest which they would not otherwise have had.

Jerry grew better steadily, but the doctor said that he must never go back to the cab work again if he wished to be an old man. The children had many consultations together about what father and mother would do, and how they could help to earn money.

One afternoon Hotspur was brought in very wet and dirty.

“The streets are nothing but slush,”said the Governor;“it will give you a good warming, my boy, to get him clean and dry.”

“All right, Governor,”said Harry,“I shall not leave him till he is; you know I have been trained by my father.”

“I wish all the boys had been trained like you,”said the Governor.

While Harry was sponging off the mud from Hotspur's body and legs, Dolly came in, looking very full of something.

“Who lives at Fairstowe, Harry? Mother has got a letter from Fairstowe; she seemed so glad, and ran upstairs to father with it.”

“Don't you know? Why, it is the name of Mrs. Fowler's place—mother's old mistress, you know—the lady that father met last summer, who sent you and me five shillings each.”

“Oh! Mrs. Fowler; of course I know all about her. I wonder what she is writing to mother about.”

“Mother wrote to her last week,”said Harry;“you know she told father if ever he gave up the cab work, she would like to know. I wonder what she says; run in and see, Dolly.”

Harry scrubbed away at Hotspur with a huish! huish! like any old hostler. In a few minutes Dolly came dancing into the stable.

“Oh! Harry, there never was anything so beautiful; Mrs. Fowler says we are all to go and live near her. There is a cottage now empty that will just suit us, with a garden, and a henhouse, and apple trees, and everything! and her coachman is going away in the spring, and then she will want father in his place; and there are good families round where you can get a place in the garden, or the stable, or as a page boy; and there's a good school for me; and mother is laughing and crying by turns, and father does look so happy!”

“That's uncommon jolly,”said Harry,“and just the right thing, I should say; it will suit father and mother both; but I don't intend to be a page boy with tight clothes and rows of buttons. I'll be a groom or a gardener.”

It was quickly settled that as soon as Jerry was well enough, they should remove to the country, and that the cab and horses should be sold as soon as possible.

This was heavy news for me, for I was not young now, and could not look for any improvement in my condition. Since I left Birtwick I had never been so happy as with my dear master, Jerry; but three years of cab work, even under the best conditions, will tell on one's strength, and I felt that I was not the horse that I had been.

Grant said at once that he would take Hotspur; and there were men on the stand who would have bought me; but Jerry said I should not go to cab work again with just anybody, and the Governor promised to find a place for me where I should be comfortable.

The day came for going away. Jerry had not been allowed to go out yet, and I never saw him after that New Year's Eve. Polly and the children came to bid me good-bye.“Poor old Jack! dear old Jack! I wish we could take you with us,”she said, and then, laying her hand on my mane, she put her face close to my neck and kissed me. Dolly was crying and kissed me too. Harry stroked me a great deal, but said nothing, only he seemed very sad, and so I was led away to my new place.





PART FOUR





46　 Jakes and the Lady


I was sold to a corn dealer and baker, whom Jerry knew, and with him he thought I should have good food and fair work. In the first he was quite right, and if my master had always been on the premises, I do not think I should have been overloaded, but there was a foreman who was always hurrying and driving every one, and frequently when I had quite a full load, he would order something else to be taken on. My carter, whose name was Jakes, often said it was more than I ought to take, but the other always overruled him:“'twas no use going twice when once would do, and he chose to get business forward.”

Jakes, like the other carters, always had the bearing rein up, which prevented me from drawing easily, and by the time I had been there three or four months, I found the work telling very much on my strength.

One day, I was loaded more than usual, and part of the road was a steep uphill: I used all my strength, but I could not get on, and was obliged continually to stop. This did not please my driver, and he laid his whip on badly.“Get on, you lazy fellow,”he said,“or I'll make you.”

Again I started the heavy load, and struggled on a few yards; again the whip came down, and again I struggled forward. The pain of that great cart whip was sharp, but my mind was hurt quite as much as my poor sides. To be punished and abused when I was doing my very best was so hard, it took the heart out of me. A third time he was fiogging me cruelly, when a lady stepped quickly up to him, and said in a sweet, earnest voice:“Oh! pray do not whip your good horse any more; I am sure he is doing all he can, and the road is very steep, I am sure he is doing his best.”

“If doing his best won't get this load up, he must do something more than his best; that's all I know, ma'am,”said Jakes.

“But is it not a heavy load?”she said.

“Yes, yes, too heavy,”he said,“but that's not my fault, the foreman came just as we were starting, and would have three hundredweight more put on to save him trouble, and I must get on with it as well as I can.”

He was raising the whip again, when the lady said:

“Pray, stop, I think I can help you if you will let me.”

The man laughed.

“You see,”she said,“you do not give him a fair chance; he cannot use all his power with his head held back as it is with that bearing rein; if you would take it off, I am sure he would do better—do try it,”she said persuasively.“I should be very glad if you would.”

“Well, well,”said Jakes, with a short laugh,“anything to please a lady of course. How far would you wish it down, ma'am?”

“Quite down, give him his head altogether.”

The rein was taken off, and in a moment I put my head down to my very knees. What a comfort it was! Then I tossed it up and down several times to get the aching stiffness out of my neck.

“Poor fellow! that is what you wanted,”said she, patting and stroking me with her gentle hand;“and now if you will speak kindly to him and lead him on, I believe he will be able to do better.”

Jakes took the rein—“Come on, Blackie.”I put down my head and threw my whole weight against the collar; I spared no strength; the load moved on, and I pulled it steadily up the hill, and then stopped to take breath.

The lady had walked along the footpath, and now came across into the road. She stroked and patted my neck, as I had not been patted for many a long day.

“You see he was quite willing when you gave him the chance; I am sure he is a fine-tempered creature, and I dare say he has known better days. You won't put that rein on again, will you?”for he was just going to hitch it up on the old plan.

“Well, ma'am, I can't deny that having his head has helped him up the hill, and I'll remember it another time, and thank you, ma'am; but if he went without a bearing rein I should be the laughing-stock of all the carters; it is the fashion, you see.”

“Is it not better,”she said,“to lead a good fashion, than to follow a bad one? A great many gentlemen do not use bearing reins now; our carriage horses have not worn them for fifteen years, and work with much less fatigue than those who have them; besides,”she added, in a very serious voice,“we have no right to distress any of God's creatures without a very good reason; we call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they feel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words. But I must not detain you now; I thank you for trying my plan with your good horse, and I am sure you will find it far better than the whip. Good-day,”and with another soft pat on my neck she stepped lightly across the path, and I saw her no more.

“That was a real lady, I'll be bound for it,”said Jakes to himself;“she spoke just as polite as if I was a gentleman, and I'll try her plan, uphill, at any rate;”and I must do him the justice to say that he let my rein out several holes, and going uphill after that he always gave me my head; but the heavy loads went on. Good feed and fair rest will keep one's strength under full work, but no horse can stand against overloading; and I was getting so thoroughly pulled down from this cause, that a younger horse was bought in my place. I may as well mention here what I suffered at this time from another cause. I had heard horses speak of it, but had never myself had experience of the evil; this was a badly-lighted stable; there was only one very small window at the end, and the consequence was that the stalls were almost dark.

Besides the depressing effect this had on my spirits, it very much weakened my sight, and when I was suddenly brought out of the darkness into the glare of daylight it was very painful to my eyes. Several times I stumbled over the threshold, and could scarcely see where I was going.

I believe, had I stayed there very long, I should have become purblind, and that would have been a great misfortune, for I have heard men say, that a stoneblind horse was safer to drive than one which had imperfect sight, as it generally makes them very timid. However, I escaped without any permanent injury to my sight, and was sold to a large cab owner.





47　 Hard Times


I shall never forget my new master; he had black eyes and a hooked nose, his mouth was as full of teeth as a bulldog's, and his voice was as harsh as the grinding of cart wheels over graveled stones. His name was Nicholas Skinner, and I believe he was the same man that poor Seedy Sam drove for.

I have heard men say that seeing is believing; but I should say that feeling is believing; for much as I had seen before, I never knew till now the utter misery of a cab-horse's life.

Skinner had a low set of cabs and a low set of drivers; he was hard on the men, and the men were hard on the horses. In this place we had no Sunday rest, and it was in the heat of summer.

Sometimes on a Sunday morning, a party of fast men would hire the cab for the day; four of them inside and another with the driver, and I had to take them ten or fifteen miles out into the country, and back again: never would any of them get down to walk up a hill, let it be ever so steep, or the day ever so hot—unless, indeed, when the driver was afraid I should not manage it, and sometimes I was so fevered and worn that I could hardly touch my food. How I used to long for the nice bran mash with niter in it that Jerry used to give us on Saturday nights in hot weather, that used to cool us down and make us so comfortable. Then we had two nights and a whole day for unbroken rest, and on Monday morning we were as fresh as young horses again; but here, there was no rest, and my driver was just as hard as his master. He had a cruel whip with something so sharp at the end that it sometimes drew blood, and he would even whip me under the belly, and fiip the lash out at my head. Indignities like these took the heart out of me terribly, but still I did my best and never hung back; for, as poor Ginger said, it was no use; men are the strongest.

My life was now so utterly wretched that I wished I might, like Ginger, drop down dead at my work, and be out of my misery; and one day my wish very nearly came to pass.

I went on the stand at eight in the morning, and had done a good share of work, when we had to take a fare to the railway. A long train was just expected in, so my driver pulled up at the back of some of the outside cabs to take the chance of a return fare. It was a very heavy train, and as all the cabs were soon engaged, ours was called for. There was a party of four; a noisy, blustering man with a lady, a little boy, and a young girl, and a great deal of luggage. The lady and the boy got into the cab, and while the man ordered about the luggage, the young girl came and looked at me.

“Papa,”she said,“I am sure this poor horse cannot take us and all our luggage so far, he is so very weak and worn up. Do look at him.”

“Oh! he's all right, miss,”said my driver,“he's strong enough.”

The porter, who was pulling about some heavy boxes, suggested to the gentleman, as there was so much luggage, whether he would not take a second cab.

“Can your horse do it, or can't he?”said the blustering man.

“Oh! he can do it all right, sir. Send up the boxes, porter: he could take more than that,”and he helped to haul up a box so heavy that I could feel the springs go down.

“Papa, papa, do take a second cab,”said the young girl in a beseeching tone;“I am sure we are wrong, I am sure it is very cruel.”

“Nonsense, Grace, get in at once, and don't make all this fuss; a pretty thing it would be if a man of business had to examine every cab-horse before he hired it—the man knows his own business of course: there, get in and hold your tongue!”

My gentle friend had to obey; and box after box was dragged up and lodged on the top of the cab, or settled by the side of the driver. At last all was ready, and with his usual jerk at the rein, and slash of the whip, he drove out of the station.

The load was very heavy, and I had had neither food nor rest since morning; but I did my best, as I always had done, in spite of cruelty and injustice.

I got along fairly till we came to Ludgate Hill, but there the heavy load and my own exhaustion were too much. I was struggling to keep on, goaded by constant chucks of the rein and use of the whip, when, in a single moment—I cannot tell how—my feet slipped from under me, and I fell heavily to the ground on my side; the suddenness and the force with which I fell seemed to beat all the breath out of my body. I lay perfectly still; indeed, I had no power to move, and I thought now I was going to die. I heard a sort of confusion round me, loud, angry voices, and the getting down of the luggage, but it was all like a dream. I thought I heard that sweet, pitiful voice saying,“Oh! that poor horse! it is all our fault.”Some one came and loosened the throat strap of my bridle, and undid the traces which kept the collar so tight upon me. Some one said,“He's dead, he'll never get up again.”Then I could hear the policeman giving orders, but I did not even open my eyes. I could only draw a gasping breath now and then. Some cold water was thrown over my head, and some cordial was poured into my mouth, and something was covered over me. I cannot tell how long I lay there, but I found my life coming back, and a kind-voiced man was patting me and encouraging me to rise. After some more cordial had been given me, and after one or two attempts, I staggered to my feet, and was gently led to some stables which were close by. Here I was put into a well-littered stall, and some warm gruel was brought to me, which I drank thankfully.

In the evening I was sufficiently recovered to be led back to Skinner's stables, where I think they did the best for me they could. In the morning Skinner came with a farrier to look at me. He examined me very closely and said:

“This is a case of overwork more than disease, and if you could give him a run off for six months he would be able to work again; but now there is not an ounce of strength in him.”

“Then he must just go to the dogs,”said Skinner,“I have no meadows to nurse sick horses in—he might get well or he might not; that sort of thing don't suit my business. My plan is to work 'em as long as they'll go, and then sell 'em for what they'll fetch, at the knacker's or elsewhere.”

“If he was broken-winded,”said the farrier,“you had better have him killed out of hand, but he is not; there is a sale of horses coming off in about ten days. If you rest him and feed him up, he may pick up, and you may get more than his skin is worth, at any rate.”

Upon this advice, Skinner, rather unwillingly, I think, gave orders that I should be well fed and cared for, and the stable man, happily for me, carried out the orders with a much better will than his master had in giving them. Ten days of perfect rest, plenty of good oats, hay, bran mashes, with boiled linseed mixed in them, did more to get up my condition than anything else could have done; those linseed mashes were delicious, and I began to think, after all, it might be better to live than go to the dogs. When the twelfth day after the accident came, I was taken to the sale, a few miles out of London. I felt that any change from my present place must be an improvement, so I held up my head, and hoped for the best.





48　Farmer Thoroughgood and His Grandson Willie


At this sale, of course I found myself in company with the old broken-down horses—some lame, some broken-winded, some old, and some that I am sure it would have been merciful to shoot.

The buyers and sellers too, many of them, looked not much better off than the poor beasts they were bargaining about. There were poor old men, trying to get a horse or a pony for a few pounds, that might drag about some little wood or coal cart. There were poor men trying to sell a worn-out beast for two or three pounds, rather than have the greater loss of killing him. Some of them looked as if poverty and hard times had hardened them all over; but there were others that I would have willingly used the last of my strength in serving; poor and shabby, but kind and human, with voices that I could trust. There was one tottering old man that took a great fancy to me, and I to him, but I was not strong enough—it was an anxious time! Coming from the better part of the fair, I noticed a man who looked like a gentleman farmer, with a young boy by his side; he had a broad back and round shoulders, a kind, ruddy face, and he wore a broad-brimmed hat. When he came up to me and my companions, he stood still, and gave a pitiful look round upon us. I saw his eye rest on me; I had still a good mane and tail, which did something for my appearance. I pricked my ears and looked at him.

“There's a horse, Willie, that has known better days.”

“Poor old fellow!”said the boy,“do you think, grandpapa, he was ever a carriage horse?”

“Oh yes! my boy,”said the farmer coming closer,“he might have been anything when he was young; look at his nostrils and his ears, the shape of his neck and shoulder; there's a deal of breeding about that horse.”He put out his hand and gave me a kind pat on the neck. I put out my nose in answer to his kindness; the boy stroked my face.

“Poor old fellow! see, grandpapa, how well he understands kindness. Could not you buy him and make him young again, as you did with Ladybird?”

“My dear boy, I can't make all old horses young; besides, Ladybird was not so very old, as she was run down and badly used.”

“Well, grandpapa, I don't believe that this one is old; look at his mane and tail. I wish you would look into his mouth, and then you could tell; though he is so very thin, his eyes are not sunk like some old horses'.”

The old gentleman laughed.“Bless the boy! he is as horsey as his old grandfather.”

“But do look at his mouth, grandpapa, and ask the price; I am sure he would grow young in our meadows.”

The man who had brought me for sale now put in his word.

“The young gentleman's a real knowing one, sir; now the fact is, this 'ere hoss is just pulled down with overwork in the cabs; he's not an old one, and I heerd as how the vetenary should say, that a six months' run off would set him right up, being as how his wind was not broken. I've had the tending of him these ten days past, and a gratefuller, pleasanter animal I never met with, and 'twould be worth a gentleman's while to give a five-pound note for him, and let him have a chance. I'll be bound he'd be worth twenty pounds next spring.”

The old gentleman laughed, and the little boy looked up eagerly.

“Oh! grandpapa, did you not say the colt sold for five pounds more than you expected? You would not be poorer if you did buy this one.”

The farmer slowly felt my legs, which were much swelled and strained; then he looked at my mouth.“Thirteen or fourteen, I should say; just trot him out, will you?”

I arched my poor thin neck, raised my tail a little, and threw out my legs as well as I could, for they were very stiff.

“What is the lowest you will take for him?”said the farmer as I came back.

“Five pounds, sir; that was the lowest price my master set.”

“'tis a speculation,”said the old gentleman, shaking his head, but at the same time slowly drawing out his purse—“quite a speculation! Have you any more business here?”he said, counting the sovereigns into his hand.

“No, sir, I can take him for you to the inn, if you please.”

“Do so, I am now going there.”

They walked forward, and I was led behind. The boy could hardly control his delight, and the old gentleman seemed to enjoy his pleasure. I had a good feed at the inn, and was then gently ridden home by a servant of my new master's and turned into a large meadow with a shed in one corner of it.

Mr. Thoroughgood, for that was the name of my benefactor, gave orders that I should have hay and oats every night and morning, and the run of the meadow during the day, and,“you, Willie,”said he,“must take the oversight of him; I give him in charge to you.”

The boy was proud of his charge, and undertook it in all seriousness. There was not a day when he did not pay me a visit, sometimes picking me out amongst the other horses, and giving me a bit of carrot, or something good, or sometimes standing by me whilst I ate my oats. He always came with kind words and caresses, and of course I grew very fond of him. He called me Old Crony, as I used to come to him in the field and follow him about. Sometimes he brought his grandfather, who always looked closely at my legs:

“This is our point, Willie,”he would say;“but he is improving so steadily that I think we shall see a change for the better in the spring.”

The perfect rest, the good food, the soft turf, and gentle exercise soon began to tell on my condition and my spirits. I had a good constitution from my mother, and I was never strained when I was young, so that I had a better chance than many horses who have been worked before they came to their full strength. During the winter my legs improved so much that I began to feel quite young again. The spring came round, and one day in March Mr. Thoroughgood determined that he would try me in the phaeton. I was well pleased, and he and Willie drove me a few miles. My legs were not stiff now, and I did the work with perfect ease.

“He's growing young, Willie; we must give him a little gentle work now, and by midsummer he will be as good as Ladybird; he has a beautiful mouth, and good paces, they can't be better.”

“Oh! grandpapa, how glad I am you bought him!”

“So am I, my boy, but he has to thank you more than me; we must now be looking out for a quiet, genteel place for him, where he will be valued.”





49　 My Last Home


One day during this summer the groom cleaned and dressed me with such extraordinary care that I thought some new change must be at hand; he trimmed my fetlocks and legs, passed the tarbrush over my hoofs, and even parted my forelock. I think the harness had an extra polish. Willie seemed half anxious, half merry, as he got into the chaise with his grandfather.

“If the ladies take to him,”said the old gentleman,“they'll be suited, and he'll be suited: we can but try.”

At the distance of a mile or two from the village, we came to a pretty, low house, with a lawn and shrubbery at the front and a drive up to the door. Willie rang the bell, and asked if Miss Blomefield, or Miss Ellen was at home. Yes, they were. So, while Willie stayed with me, Mr. Thoroughgood went into the house. In about ten minutes he returned, followed by three ladies; one tall, pale lady, wrapped in a white shawl, leaned on a younger lady, with dark eyes and a merry face; the other, a very stately-looking person, was Miss Blomefield. They all came and looked at me and asked questions. The younger lady—that was Miss Ellen—took to me very much; she said she was sure she should like me, I had such a good face. The tall, pale lady said that she should always be nervous in riding behind a horse that had once been down, as I might come down again, and if I did, she should never get over the fright.

“You see, ladies,”said Mr. Thoroughgood,“many first-rate horses have had their knees broken through the carelessness of their drivers, without any fault of their own, and from what I see of this horse, I should say, that is his case: but of course I do not wish to infiuence you. If you incline, you can have him on trial, and then your coachman will see what he thinks of him.”

“You have always been such a good adviser to us about our horses,”said the stately lady,“that your recommendation would go a long way with me, and if my sister Lavinia sees no objection, we will accept your offer of a trial, with thanks.”

It was then arranged that I should be sent for the next day.

In the morning a smart-looking young man came for me; at first he looked pleased, but when he saw my knees he said in a disappointed voice:

“I didn't think, sir, you would have recommended my ladies a blemished horse like that.”

“‘Handsome is that handsome does,’”said my master;“you are only taking him on trial, and I am sure you will do fairly by him, young man, and if he is not as safe as any horse you ever drove, send him back.”

I was led to my new home, placed in a comfortable stable, fed and left to myself. The next day, when the groom was cleaning my face, he said:

“That is just like the star that Black Beauty had, he is much the same height too; I wonder where he is now.”

A little further on he came to the place in my neck where I was bled and where a little knot was left in the skin. He almost started, and began to look me over carefully, talking to himself.

“White star in the forehead, one white foot on the off side, this little knot just in that place—”then looking at the middle of my back—“and as I am alive, there is that little patch of white hair that John used to call ‘Beauty's three-penny bit.’ It must be Black Beauty! Why, Beauty! Beauty! do you know me? little Joe Green that almost killed you?”And he began patting and patting me as if he was quite overjoyed.

I could not say that I remembered him, for now he was a fine grown young fellow, with black whiskers and a man's voice, but I was sure he knew me, and that he was Joe Green, and I was very glad. I put my nose up to him, and tried to say that we were friends. I never saw a man so pleased.

“Give you a fair trial! I should think so indeed! I wonder who the rascal was that broke your knees, my old Beauty! You must have been badly served out somewhere; well, well, it won't be my fault if you haven't good times of it now. I wish John Manly was here to see you.”

In the afternoon I was put into a low Park chair and brought to the door. Miss Ellen was going to try me, and Green went with her. I soon found that she was a good driver, and she seemed pleased with my paces. I heard Joe telling her about me, and that he was sure I was Squire Gordon's old Black Beauty.

When we returned, the other sisters came out to hear how I had behaved myself. She told them what she had just heard, and said:

“I shall certainly write to Mrs. Gordon, and tell her that her favorite horse has come to us. How pleased she will be!”

After this I was driven every day for a week or so, and as I appeared to be quite safe Miss Lavinia at last ventured out in the small close carriage. After this it was quite decided to keep me and call me by my old name of“Black Beauty.”

I have now lived in this happy place a whole year. Joe is the best and kindest of grooms. My work is easy and pleasant, and I feel my strength and spirits all coming back again. Mr. Thoroughgood said to Joe the other day:

“In your place he will last till he is twenty years old—perhaps more.”Willie always speaks to me when he can, and treats me as his special friend. My ladies have promised that I shall never be sold, and so I have nothing to fear; and here my story ends. My troubles are all over, and I am at home; and often before I am quite awake, I fancy I am still in the orchard at Birtwick, standing with my old friends under the apple trees.
