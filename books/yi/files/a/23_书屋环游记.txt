第一章


不管你的书架有多简陋，也不管你的书房有多破败，关上你身后的门，抛开所有外界的烦扰，重回伟大先贤的怀抱，让他们抚慰你的心灵，你会通过那扇魔法之门，进入一片明净之地，在那里，你将不再有忧愁和烦恼。你已将庸俗和污秽的一切都抛在了身后。在书架上，你那些高贵而沉默的同伴正列队等着你。目光扫过它们，选择你要拜读其作品的那位作者。接下来，向他伸出你的手，你们就可以一起进入梦幻之境。若不是熟悉感已令我们变得麻木，那一排书一定会让我们觉得有些怪异恐怖。它们每一本，都是被蜡布、泡碱皮革和印刷油墨收殓起来的不朽灵魂。对于一本货真价实的书而言，它的封面之下埋藏着一个人思想的精华。作者的音容笑貌早已消逝无踪，肉身也湮灭于尘土之中，但他们的精神却仍在那里，供你随时差遣。

同样，我们也会因为熟悉感作祟而不能充分认识到能享有这福气是多么幸运。假如我们突然听说莎士比亚重返人间，并且得知他愿意跟我们中的任何一个人待上一个小时，分享他的智慧和奇思，我们得多迫切地想去找到他啊！但其实，他就在我们身边，或者说凝聚了他思想精髓的著作就在我们触手可及的地方，一周接一周地过去，而我们却不愿抬手把他召唤过来。

无论一个人情绪如何，只要他穿过了这扇魔法之门，他就可以唤出世界上最伟大的那些能与他心灵产生共鸣的人。如果他爱思考，这里有思想界的王者；如果他爱幻想，这里有想象力一流的大师。如果他想要一点娱乐呢？他可以召唤世界上任何一个伟大的说故事高手，逝者就会出现，让他长久地沉醉在故事之中。逝者是良伴，甚至让人忘却生者。对我们大多数人来说，沉迷于逝去的人的思想，却找不到自己的思想和灵魂，是一种真实而急迫的危险。对大多数人而言，生活是无趣又乏味的，令人灵魂枯竭，因此，就算只是看看别人经历的浪漫和激情，也好过生活中的单调乏味。但是，如果能从逝者的智慧和经历中得到指引，汲取力量，去应对我们人生中那些难熬的日子，那是最好不过了。

与我一起穿过这扇魔法之门吧，坐在这张绿色的沙发上，你抬眼就可以看到那个旧橡木书架，书架上面杂乱地摆着许多书。抽支烟也没关系。你听我讲讲它们的故事好吗？要知道，这是我最大的请求了，因为那里的每一本书都是我珍贵的密友，有什么能比谈论如益友般的书籍更让人感到愉悦的事呢？其他的书在离沙发稍远一些的地方，但是这些书是我的心头好—我会一遍遍地去重读，也愿意把它们搁在我的胳膊边上，方便我随时阅读。每一个被翻破的封面，都能唤起我美好的回忆。

那书架中的一些书，是我牺牲了一些东西才获得的，让我格外珍惜。你注意到底下那些棕色的旧书了吗？它们每一本都代表着一顿午餐。我学生时代买下那些书时，手头并不宽裕。我只有三便士午餐费，只够买一个三明治和一杯啤酒；但是，不巧啊，在我去上课的路上正好会经过世界上最迷人的一家书店。在书店门外有一个大浴缸，里面总是凌乱地堆着许多破破烂烂的书，一批批还不重样，上头有一张卡片，卡片上面写着的每一本书的价钱正好是我口袋里的数目。每当我走到这儿的时候，在我年轻而饥饿的身体与好奇而无所不读的思想之间，总有一场激烈的搏斗。六次当中可能有五次都是动物本能占了上风。但是当思想需求胜利的时候，我就会欢喜地一头扎进那堆书里，从过时的年鉴、多卷本苏格兰神学书和对数表册子当中翻出一本可买的书，那时候我就觉得一切都值了。如果你仔细地看看这些书，你会发现我干得还不错。戈登翻译的四卷本《塔西佗》（如果有好的译本，何必浪费生命去读原著呢）、威廉·坦普尔爵士[1]的随笔集、艾迪生[2]的作品、斯威夫特的《澡盆故事》、克拉伦登[3]的《英国叛乱和内战史》和勒萨日的《吉尔·布拉斯》[4]、白金汉公爵的诗集、丘吉尔公爵的诗集、《培根的一生》—这些好书可都是在一个处理三便士旧书的老浴缸里淘来的。

而且与它们为伴的也不仅仅是些粗鄙的邻居。可以看到有些书的封面是很厚的真皮做成的，褪色的字体仍能看出当初精美的烫金工艺。它们曾让某位贵族的图书馆书架熠熠生辉。就算是各种各样的年历和布道书，也可以看出它们曾经的辉煌，就像看到一位身着褪色丝质衣裙的淑女，能看出她现在处境艰难，也能看出她曾经生活优渥。

如今，阅读已经是一件很容易的事情了，到处都是便宜的纸版书和免费的图书馆。当某样东西不费力就能得到的时候，人们往往不懂得珍惜它的价值。今天谁还能体会到卡莱尔[5]拿到吉本[6]的《罗马帝国衰亡史》时的兴奋感啊？那时候他把六卷本的书夹在胳膊下，急匆匆就回了家，头脑是那么渴望养分，一天就能读完一本！只有你真正拥有一本书，只有你为它付出了汗水，你才能真正品尝到它的滋味，否则你永远无法体会到拥有它的那种发自内心的自豪感。

如果要让我从这一列书中选出一本，虽然它们都给过我极大的快乐，让我受益匪浅，我想我还是会选麦考莱[7]的那本满是污渍的《批评和历史文集》[8]。当我回首往事，这本书似乎与我全部的生活交织。在学生时代，它是我的战友；在闷热难耐的黄金海岸，它跟我在一起；在我去北极的捕鲸之旅中，它也在我为数不多的个人物品之中。那些朴实的苏格兰鱼叉手读它的时候脑子都被搞糊涂了，你仍然能看见那些斑斑油渍，它们来自助理机械师，当时他在试图读懂腓特烈大帝的内容。尽管它又破又脏，都快散架了，但就算是一本有金边装饰、摩洛哥真皮做封面的书也不能替代它在我心中的地位。

对有志研究文学与历史的人来说，这本书能提供绝佳的入口。弥尔顿、马基雅维利、哈勒姆、骚塞、班扬、拜伦、约翰逊、皮特、汉普顿、克莱夫、黑斯廷斯、查塔姆—他们每个人都代表一种思想的核心！只要掌握了每个的精髓，再去填补知识的空当就会显得轻松而愉快了。书中短小而生动的句子、恢宏的隐喻、精确的细节，这些都为每个主题投下了一圈迷人的光环，再懒惰的读者也想去读更多的内容。如果连麦考莱的手都不能把一个人引上那些令人愉悦的求知之路，那这个人可没有别的希望能找到它们了。

当我还是个高中生的时候，这本文集—当然不是现在我手上的这本，在它之前我还有过一个更破旧的版本—为我打开了一个新世界。之前，历史只是学校要求我学的一门课程，我很抵触它。读了这本书，历史就不再是令我烦恼的学习任务了，而是走向梦幻大地的一次旅行，在那片绚丽多彩之地的旅行途中，还有一位亲切又智慧的向导为我指路。我甚至喜爱他气势非凡的风格里的那些瑕疵—实际上，我现在反而觉得我爱的正是它们。丰富的辞藻让句子不过于呆板，对仗的使用也从不让人觉得花哨。我喜欢读他写的“宇宙爆发的狂笑从塔霍河到维斯瓦河都能听得到，告诉教皇十字军战士的时代已成过往”。当我读到这一段的时候，也感到非常愉悦：“杰宁汉夫人有一个花瓶，专门放有的人写的糊涂诗，达什先生写的诗就正好可以放进杰宁汉夫人的花瓶里。”这种句子曾经给了我一种说不清但却持久的快乐，就像和弦的声音萦绕在乐手的耳边。当人逐渐成熟，他的文学口味也会变得更平实，但每当我的目光扫过这部文集的时候，我心中都充满了敬意，惊叹于麦考莱处理宏大主题的能力，不仅如此，他还能用令人愉悦的细节来修饰它—像是一个人拿着画笔随手一挥，然后以极其精细的点画法来做装饰。当他领着你一路走来，也总会给你指引那些通向他处的诱人的岔路。要是有人能读完这部文集里提到的每一本书，那他也就完成了一段绝佳的文学和历史教育，虽说有点老派。一个年轻人究竟能在多少岁时完成这段教育，我倒是很好奇。

真希望麦考莱写过历史小说，我相信他一定能写得特别好。我不知道他有没有能力刻画一个虚构的人物，但是他确实具有非凡的能力，能把故去的名人形象刻画得栩栩如生。看看他写约翰逊博士和他周围的气氛的这半段文字就够了。在这么短的篇幅里，能把画面描述得如此清晰的文字可真不多见：

当我们关上门的时候，俱乐部房间内的景象就在我们眼前了，桌上摆着给纽金特的蛋卷和给约翰逊的柠檬。里面聚集着在雷诺兹油画里永存的人们。戴着眼镜的伯克，身材瘦高的兰顿，面带威严的冷笑的博克莱尔，总是笑容满面的加里克，用手指轻敲着鼻烟盒的吉本，还有戴着助听器的乔舒亚爵士。在最显眼位置上，有一个奇怪的人，他的身形就跟我们从小见到的那些男人差不多—巨大的身躯，大而粗糙的脸庞，脸上布满了因疾病而留下的疤痕，穿着棕色的外衣、黑色的毛线袜子，灰白的假发最顶上都已经烧焦了，双手都很脏，指甲咬得都露出了肉。我们看到他的眼睛和嘴巴因为痉挛性的抽搐不停在动，他沉重的身躯左右摇摆；我们听见了喘气的声音，然后传来一声“干吗呢？先生”，接着是“那又怎样呢？先生”，还有“不，先生”，然后是“你在这个问题上没抓住要点，先生”。

这画面将会永远铭刻在你的脑海里。

我记得我十六岁那年去伦敦，放好行李之后的第一件事情就是去参拜麦考莱的陵墓。他被安葬在西敏寺，就在艾迪生的坟墓近旁，安息在他无比热爱的诗人们中间。对我而言，这是伦敦最大的吸引力。当想到我从他那里学到的一切时，这种感觉也是非常自然的。他不仅教给我知识、勾起我对新事物的兴趣，还让我体味到他那种迷人的绅士般的语调、豁达而自由的人生观，以及对盲从和偏见的摒弃。我如今的判断更证实了我那时对他的感情。

你看，我那四卷本的《英国史》就放在《批评和历史文集》的旁边。你能记起这部书的第三章吗？这一章重现了英格兰十七世纪的历史。我一直觉得这是麦考莱创作生涯的巅峰，将精确的史实与浪漫的词句完美地结合在了一起。其中，城镇的人口的数量，商业的统计数据，以及平淡无奇的日常生活，经大师之手描绘，全都变得美好又有趣。你会觉得，只要他愿意，他甚至能让乘法表把你给迷住。举个具体的例子你就能明白我的意思了。在那个出行困难的年代，一个在乡下的伦敦人和一个在伦敦的乡下人，同样会感觉格格不入。这件事似乎没什么值得说的，好像在读者脑海中也不会留下太深的印象。但是看看麦考莱是怎么写的吧，虽然这个例子只是他探讨问题的精彩段落的百分之一：

一个伦敦人在乡间，会被人盯着看，就像他闯进了非洲南部霍屯督人的牲畜栏。另一方面，一个从林肯郡或什罗普郡来的庄园主出现在伦敦舰队街[9]的时候，人们也能很快把他和当地居民区别开来，因为他看起来就跟一个土耳其人或印度水手一样显眼。他的衣着、步态、口音，他盯着商店的样子，他会一不注意踩进排水沟，跟搬运工撞个满怀，站在排水口下面，这都让他成了被骗或被戏弄的完美目标。地痞把他挤进沟渠里，出租马车的车夫溅他一身水，而当他沉醉于市长就职巡游队伍的壮观景象时，小偷就会仔细地把他骑装外套的大口袋翻个遍。骗子会上前对他来一番自我介绍，在他看来他们简直就是他所见过的最正直的绅士。浓妆艳抹的站街女，纽克纳尔街和惠特斯通公园的社会底层女子，在他看来简直就是贵妇和女王的侍女。如果他问人怎么去圣詹姆斯公园，指路人会把他带到麦尔安德的贫民区。如果他走进一家商店，店家立刻就会把没人愿意买的东西推销给他，比如二手的刺绣品、铜戒指和不会再走起来的钟表。如果他不小心走进了某家时髦的咖啡馆，他立刻就会成为花花公子无礼嘲笑的对象，圣殿骑士也会开他的玩笑。

他感到愤怒和羞辱，立即返回自己的宅邸，在那里有效忠他的佃户，有意气相投的朋友，他们能够抚慰经历了耻辱而恼火的他。在那里，他重新成了一个有分量的人物，除了在巡回法庭上他要坐在法官旁边的位子上，或在民兵集会上他要向郡治安长官敬礼，别的时候，他并不觉得还有谁比他的地位高。

总的来说，我很想把这个独立的描写章节放在他《批评和历史文集》的最前头，尽管它出现在另一卷书里。对我而言，《英国史》整体上并没有达到麦考莱的其他短篇文章的水准。它让人觉得这是来自一个热忱的辉格党成员的精彩辩护，对于另一方的情况也没有做出详尽的描述。受他本人政治和宗教观点所限，《批评和历史文集》中的有些部分无疑也是存在瑕疵的。它最好的部分在那些摆脱限制、涉及广阔的文学和哲学领域的作品中。他笔下的约翰逊、沃波尔、达布莱夫人、艾迪生，以及跟印度有关的两位—克莱夫·黑斯廷斯和沃伦·黑斯廷斯，都是我的最爱。腓特烈大帝的部分当然也是最好的文章之一。只有一篇我希望能帮他删掉，那就是对诗人蒙哥马利恶毒而聪明的评论。我多么希望麦考莱的心能更柔软一些，灵魂能更高尚一些，不要这么尖酸刻薄地去批判别人。不好的作品自然会被淹没，没有必要把它的作者也打入万丈深渊。如果他没有这篇如此野蛮的文章，我对他的看法会更好一些。

不知道为什么，我一谈起麦考莱就会自然地想到司各特[10]，他那些书—橄榄色的书脊已经褪色了—占据了我一整个书架。也许是因为他们两个人都深深影响了我，我也非常崇拜他们。又或者是因为这两个人在思想和性格方面真的非常相似。你说你不这么觉得？好，你想想司各特的《苏格兰边境歌谣集》，再想想麦考莱的《古罗马叙事诗》。他们大脑的运作机制是那么相似，所创作的作品也很类似。只有麦考莱能写出司各特的诗，也只有司各特可能写出麦考莱的诗。他们两个人诗歌里的旋律和一气呵成的风格是多么相似！他们都那么尊崇男子气概、高尚德行和英勇品格！行文简洁，却如此有力！但是，对有的人来说，脑袋里根本就没有力量和简洁的概念。他们认为如果文字不晦涩难懂，那一定很肤浅，就好像平常看到的浅浅水流，一般都很浑浊，只有深水才会澄澈。你记得马修·阿诺德对《古罗马叙事诗》愚蠢的批判之词吗？引用了以下四行之后，他说：“这也叫诗歌？”

男人面对渺茫的胜算，

为父辈的英魂而战，

为神灵的殿宇而亡，

这才是死得其所。

他试图证明麦考莱没有写诗歌的才能，其实不过是证明了他自己没有让人激动的戏剧才能。很显然，这种意象和语言上的率直冒犯了他，但这种率直才是《古罗马叙事诗》真正的优点。麦考莱用的是简单而直接的词语，而这正是一个天真的战士在他准备英勇就义前请求两位战友给他鼓气时应该用的词语。在这里，任何华而不实的文字都无法跟人物形象搭配。我觉得从语境中来看，这几行诗正是上好的民谣诗歌，而他也绝对具有一个民谣诗人该有的那种戏剧感和直觉。阿诺德的这种评语动摇了我对他的信任，但是不管怎么说，我会原谅一个写出了如下诗句的人：

下一次冲锋，就会永远倒下，

当愚人之堡倒下时，

愿胜利者们来时，

在城墙边上能发现我的遗骨！

把这几行诗当作人生抱负也不算坏。

这就是人类社会还不明白的东西之一—高贵而激励人心的文字的价值。如果我们都认可了它们的价值，那么应该到处会看到它们被刻在适当的地方。当我们走在街上，我们的眼睛看到这一连串美丽的精神脉搏和图像时，它们所代表的思想也反射进我们的灵魂之中，这一段行程将多么令人愉悦而又心生崇敬啊。想想吧，如果我们一个个都脑袋空空地走在路上，那么所有这些伟大的素材都被浪费掉了。我不仅是指《圣经》里的文字，因为它们对每个人来说含义不尽相同，当然了，有句话是“趁着白日，我们必须做那差我来者的工；黑夜将到，就没有人能做工了”[11]，谁能不被这句话激励呢？但我指的是那些美好的思想—谁敢说它们不具有激励人心的效果呢—可以从一百个作者中选出它们来，用在一百种不同的地方。用准确的语言表达出来的优质思想可是珍宝，不应该被埋没，而应被广泛地运用，为世界添彩。拿最近的例子来讲，我家路对面就有一个马槽，就是常见的那种石头制成的马槽，人们从它旁边走过的时候，只会对它的丑陋外观产生一种厌恶之情。但试想一下如果在它前面的石板上刻上柯勒律治的这几句诗会怎样呢？

对大小生灵爱得越真诚，

祷告便越有成效；

因为上帝爱一切生灵—

一切都由他创造。[12]

我想可能我引用的内容不太准确，因为我手边没有《古舟子咏》。但就算是这样，不也能提升一下马槽的格调吗？我想我们平时都这么做过，我们有自己的小习惯。大多数人都会把一些精选的引言印在书房的壁炉台上，或更好一点，他们把那些文字印在了心中。卡莱尔的“宁静！宁静！我难道不能拥有永久的宁静吗！”对一个情绪低沉的人来说，可真是很不错的激励。但是，我们需要的是能够用在公众领域的类似东西，而不是这种个人化的东西，直到人们明白一个能铭刻于心的思想跟那些雕刻出来的图案一样美，它能通过眼睛直抵心灵。

然而，所有这些都跟麦考莱恢宏的《古罗马叙事诗》没关系，除非你想找点关于男子气概和爱国主义的句子，这种句子你倒是能在里面找到不少呢。我很幸运，小时候曾经背诵过《贺拉斯叙事诗》，它深深印在了我那时容易被塑造的心灵中，所以直到现在我差不多还能一口气把它背出来。戈德史密斯[13]说在与人对话的时候，他就像是一个在银行里有数千英镑存款的人，但是却敌不过口袋里当时正有六便士的人。因此，比起整个书架上那些你想起来才会翻的书，你脑袋里实际记住的诗才更有价值。现在，我请你把目光往书架的下面一格再移一点，看看那一行橄榄绿色的书。它们就是我收藏的司各特作品。当然了，在我深入谈它们之前，我应该给你一点喘气的时间。





第二章


当自己开始独立生活的时候，能有一些属于自己的真正的好书会是件很棒的事情。最初你可能不太欣赏它们，你也许会渴望一本纯粹的冒险小说。在某些情况下，你可能更偏爱这类冒险小说。但是，无聊的日子会来，雨天也会来，因此你将不得不填充你阅读生活的缝隙，而那些好书已经等候多时了。然后，某一天将成为你人生的一个里程碑，在这一天，你突然明白了差别。像有一道闪电划过你的脑海，你看清了什么是毫无价值的文字，而什么才是真正的文学。那天之后，你可能还会去看那些粗糙的书，但至少你心中有了对比的标准。你不会再跟以前一样了。渐渐地，你会更喜欢好的文学；随着你思想的成熟，这种好的文学会累积起来；它会成为更好的你的组成部分，最终你回头看那些陈旧封面的时候，你会爱它们过去所代表的一切，就像我一样。没错，就是司各特的那些橄榄绿的小说激发了我对文学的狂热。我最早拥有的书就是它们—早在我能欣赏甚至理解它们之前，但是最终我意识到了它们是珍贵的宝藏。小时候，我晚上就着快燃尽的蜡烛偷偷地读着，罪恶感给故事增加了一重刺激。或许你注意到我的《艾凡赫》跟其他书不是一个版本的。第一本《艾凡赫》被忘在河边的草丛中，落进了水里，三天后它才在河岸的泥泞里被捡起来，纸都被泡胀了，书也变形了。不过我得说，在失去它之前，我早已经把它翻得不成样子了。说真的，在找到新版之前，那本书我看了好几年，我总是不由自主地重读这本书，而不是去开辟新领域。

我想起已故的詹姆斯·佩恩[14]曾给我讲过一则趣事。他曾与两位文学圈的友人约好写下他们心中所认为的文学作品中最具有戏剧性的一幕，最后检查答案的时候，发现他们选的是同一个场景：在阿什贝镇，那位无名骑士骑马经过那观众寥寥无几的看台，将长矛锋利的尖刃指向令人生畏的圣殿骑士的盾，向他发起生死挑战。是啊，这是多么精彩的时刻！根据教会的法则，圣殿骑士不可能出现在比武大会这种世俗而轻浮的场合，可谁还管这事呢！让这样的事情发生，正是文学大师的特权，去质疑它可就太无礼了。温德尔·霍尔姆斯不是描写过那类无趣之人吗？他们带着几个所谓的事实进入一间会客厅，就像带了几只脾气暴躁的斗牛犬在脚边，一有想象的情节出现，就把它们放出去咬人。伟大的作家是不会弄错的。如果莎士比亚给波西米亚设定了一条海岸线，或者说维克多·雨果管一个英国拳击手叫吉姆·约翰—杰克先生，那事实就应当如此，没别的可说。一位编辑对一个不出名的作家说：“那时候铁路还没有支线呢。”作家回答说：“我创造了那条支线。”如果他能让读者信服，那么这就是他的权利。

但这就是《艾凡赫》之外的话题了。它真是一本好书呀！我觉得它在英语历史小说类里面能排第二名。每次重读都让我更为欣赏它。司各特笔下的战士普遍都很优秀，他笔下的女性角色则比较弱小（也有例外）。在这本书里，他笔下的战士非常出色，而蕊贝卡这个浪漫的女性角色则跳出了常规框架，挽回了故事中女性的形象。司各特写的男人都很有男子气概，正如他自己，所以他写这些人物的时候轻松自如。

他描写女性主人公是由于习俗要求，他也从未强硬地去打破这一束缚。只有我们连续读他十几章对于女性人物着墨极少的章节后，才能意识到他在连续的浪漫主义叙事描写中达到了怎样的高度，比如，从比武大会开始到塔克修士事件结束的这部分。我觉得在我们文学史上，没有其他那么长的描写还写得那么精彩的。

我承认，司各特的小说里也有令人难以忍受的冗长的废话。那些毫无必要的引言好像没有止境似的，像是要撬开非常厚的壳才能吃到牡蛎的肉。这些文字本身确实令人佩服，旁征博引、妙趣横生而且生气勃勃，但是跟它们要介绍的故事没有任何关系，而且比例失调。就跟我们很多其他英语小说一样，它们是好东西，但是出现在了不恰当的地方。偏题、缺乏技巧和次序是我们的传统罪过。萨克雷在《名利场》中就很花哨地加入了一篇文章，介绍如何不依靠任何东西撑过一年，狄更斯在一个鬼故事里面也大胆地把与故事无关的事插入进来。这就像是剧作家冲上舞台开始讲奇闻逸事，而他的剧正急着开演，演员们也正在后面焦急地等他讲完。这都是不对的，虽然每一个伟大的作家都曾经犯过这样的错误。遗憾的是，我们对形式的把握十分欠缺，沃尔特·司各特爵士只是犯了一个其他人也犯的错。一旦读者挨过了这些废话，来到故事中的决定性时刻，有谁能像他一样，找到那么精练的语句，那么简短而准确的词来描写这些重要场景呢？还记得那个场景吗？鲁莽的龙骑兵中士终于站在了冷峻的清教徒面前，后者已经被悬赏通缉。“要么得到一千座墓碑，要么以石楠为床！”他拔剑时说。清教徒也拔了剑，说：“以主与基甸之剑！”这里就没有多余的词！但是通过这几个简单有力的词，两个对手，以及他们代表的两个派别的真正精神就深深印在了你的脑海中。当穆斯林骑着战马冲来时，撒克逊的瓦兰吉人喊道：“准备弓箭和钩戟！”你会觉得他们当时肯定就是这么喊的。比这些更为简洁和有效的口号，来自这一战斗民族的先辈，那时他们正在“威塞克斯的红龙”麾下杀敌，此战发生在距黑斯廷斯[15]不远的一个土丘。“滚出去！滚出去！”当诺曼人的骑兵突然出现在他们眼前的时候，他们就这么吼叫着。简短，有力，平淡—这个民族的特质就体现在这些作战的呐喊中。

难道更高层次的情感在这里缺失了吗？还是说因为它们太珍贵而被抑制并隐藏起来了，不向外人表露？也许两者都有吧。我曾经见过一位海军的遗孀，那位海军还是一个年轻的候补信号少尉时，曾经把从信号兵那里得到的纳尔逊著名的决战消息传达给船上其他船员。军官们都很深受震动，但是船员们却没有大惊小怪。“职责！”他们嘟囔着说，“我们不一直这么干吗。有什么了不起？”不管什么说辞，哪怕只跟浮夸沾点边儿，都只会压制而不是提升英国人的士气。能让他们高兴的是那些低调的说法。德国军队行军时可能会唱着路德的赞美诗。法国人只要一唱关于荣誉与祖国的歌就能狂热起来。我们写军事主题的诗人不必费心地去模仿—至少不用想象如果他们这样做了，他们能鼓舞起英国士兵的士气。我们的水手在南非摆弄重型机枪时，会唱：“这还有块儿糖给鸟儿吃。”我曾经看到一个军团唱着“我只要上面的一点点”这句副歌就上了战场。前面说到的军事诗人，除非能有吉卜林的天分和洞见，否则在写这种咏唱词之前可会浪费不少的墨水。俄国人在这一点上倒是跟我们有点像。我曾经读过一个纵队在突击时的故事，从开始到最后他们一直在昂扬地唱着歌，直到最后的几个胜利者站在山头之上时，他们仍然在唱歌。一个见证了这一幕的人问他们是什么神奇的歌曲支撑他们完成了这一英勇的壮举，结果他发现他们不停重复的那句词其实是“伊凡在菜园里收卷心菜”。事实上，我觉得可能是这种单调的声音能取代战争残酷的喧嚣，因此把战士都催眠了，让他们能有英勇之举。

我们那些大西洋对岸的表亲，也同样在他们最严肃的事业里混入了幽默感。在那场盎格鲁—凯尔特人发动的最残酷的战争里，可以说他们被逼到了极限，也展现出了他们真实的面貌，他们唱的歌—《脚步咚咚咚！》《约翰·布朗的遗体》《行军走过佐治亚州》—都有一种诙谐的幽默感在其中。我只记得一个例外，而它是我能想起的最了不起的军歌。就算是在和平时代的局外人读到它时，也会充满感情。我说的当然是茱莉亚·沃德·豪[16]写的《共和国战歌》，它开头的合唱是这样的：“我已看见，上帝降临，带来荣耀光芒。”如果在战场唱起这句，那效果一定非常惊人。

我又跑题了很久，是吧？但是在魔法门的另一边，最忌讳有这种想法。要带出来一个话题，不可避免地要牵扯出一大堆其他相关的东西。但我正在说司各特的士兵，举止毫不做作，不会装腔作势和豪言壮语（没有任何英雄憎恶的言行），而只有这些简短直率的词语和纯粹的英勇之举，每一个词语和隐喻都来自他本能的想法。但可惜的是，尽管司各特如此热烈地赞赏军人，却极少描写他同时代的士兵—他们可能是有史以来最优秀的士兵。没错，司各特是写过一位军人帝王的一生，但那是他写作生涯的败笔。一个托利党的爱国人士，在他的全部认知中，拿破仑都是忤逆的恶魔，这样怎么可能写得好这个主题呢？但那时，只有他能以共鸣之心来书写欧洲的素材。为了看到他笔下描写的穆拉特轻骑兵或禁卫军的掷弹兵，我们不都愿意付出一切吗？他也以同样大胆的笔调写过古斯塔夫的骑兵上尉，以及《昆廷·杜沃德》里法国国王禁卫军的弓箭手。

在司各特待在巴黎的那段时间里，他一定见过不少这样的铁血军人，在过去的二十年里，他们既是欧洲苦难的根源，也是欧洲苦难的救赎。于我们而言，一八一四年在人行道上冲他吼的那些士兵，就跟他小说里那些身穿铠甲的武士和狂妄自大的骑士一样，是些有趣而浪漫的人物。他描写一位半岛战争的退伍老兵的生活，并配上他对威灵顿公爵的评价，这个老兵的形象就跟他描写的在德国战争中的戴尔吉铁一样令人印象深刻。但在那时，没有人意识到他们所生活的那个时代的真正精髓是什么。人们没有辨别伟大与渺小的能力，而是让近处的小事挡住了远一点的大事。在黑暗中，萤火虫容易被当成星星。想想吧，在那些早期的大画师还在酒馆的雅座寻找他们的作画对象或圣塞巴斯蒂安[17]式的模特时，哥伦布即将发现美洲大陆，可得让他们大开眼界了。

我说过，我认为《艾凡赫》是司各特写得最好看的小说。我想大多数人会认同这一看法。那么，他写的第二好看的小说是哪部呢？其实他的其他小说水平都相当，任何一部都可能让某个人很喜欢，将这一票投给它。对出生在苏格兰的人来说，司各特那些写苏格兰生活和人物的小说读起来非常纯正，因此与众不同。在这类小说里，有根植于这片土地的幽默感，比如《清教徒》、《古董家》和《罗伯·罗伊》，这让它们与别的小说区分开来。他笔下的苏格兰老妇人是他描写得最为成功的人物形象之一，仅次于他笔下的士兵。但同时，我们也必须承认，使用方言有好处也有局限，用方言的作品远不如那些全世界读者都能欣赏的作品好。总的来说，《昆廷·杜沃德》这部小说能让我投票为第二名，它的关注范围更广，人物塑造有力，描写事件和人物时，欧洲背景的分量也很足。它是所有剑与披风式小说的鼻祖，这种类型的小说为数众多，是十八世纪通俗文学的重要成员。他把大胆的查理和狡诈的路易十一描写得极为生动。我几乎能看见这对死敌看着一群猎犬在追信使，相继发出一阵阵残忍的狂笑，这画面似乎就在我眼前，比我眼睛看到的大部分东西都要清晰。

从柯米尼斯开始，路易十一性情中的狡诈、残忍、迷信和胆小都被细致地表现了出来，他那位粗率而好战的对手更是将路易十一这些特点衬托得令人印象深刻。通常历史人物真实的样子会跟文字描述得很不一样，但是在因斯布鲁克的高教会派[18]的教堂里，我看到的雕像就像是从司各特书里走出来的—路易身材瘦削，一副苦行者模样，像是随时准备做坏事；而查理则长着个拳击手的脑袋。所以当我们看到一幅画像颠覆了之前的想象时，难免会感到失望，比如，在国家肖像美术馆里看到的那幅，画里的男人一副贵族相，肤色是浅褐色，像个诗人，乍一看还以为这张脸属于邪恶的杰弗里斯法官。不过，也有例外，比如在因斯布鲁克，我们就绝对会感到满意。在我面前有一幅画，就在那边的壁炉台上，表现的是玛丽女王的爱人鲍斯韦尔伯爵。把它拿下来，看看吧。注意那个大脑袋，该是能想出大计谋的样子；那张坚毅而狂野的脸，上帝造它就是为了迷住一个敏感娇弱的女子；五官严峻，令人过目难忘—看那嘴巴，里面像是藏着野猪的獠牙，再看那胡子，要是他发起怒来，肯定会竖起来。这个人的性格和他一生的命运都在这幅画里呈现出来了。我好奇司各特有没有可能看过这张画的原作，它就挂在赫伯恩家族的祖宅之中。

就我个人而言，我一直觉得司各特有一部小说特别好，虽然评论家对它评价很苛刻，这部作品也是他劳累的写作生涯末期的作品。我说的是《巴黎的罗伯特伯爵》。我一直坚信如果这本书是他第一部而不是最后一部，得到的关注一定不输《威弗利》。我能理解那位专家的想法，他又是崇拜又是绝望地喊道：“我这辈子都在研究拜占庭社会，这来了个苏格兰律师，只用一下子就让我明白了整个情况！”很多人都或多或少能成功地描述出诺曼底时期的英格兰，或是中世纪时期的法国，但是把一个已经完全逝去的文明描绘得如此真实，而且有威仪，有精确的细节，我得说，这才是一部最佳的大师杰作。在小说完成之前，他的健康状况就显出了每况愈下的端倪，如果这部小说后半部有前半部一样的水准，如果后面也有类似安娜·康尼努斯大声读她父亲的丰功伟绩时的幽默，或是有十字军战士在博斯普鲁斯海岸边集结时的宏伟场景，那这部小说毫无疑问能进入他小说作品排名的前列。

我肯定会给它这个位置，如果他继续保持了那种叙事风格，把第一次十字军东征的真实进程还原给我们看，那是如何壮阔的事件啊！它具有一般历史事件少有的特征，具有明确的开端、中间部分，以及结局，从彼得发疯似的布道，到耶路撒冷的陷落。瞧瞧那些领袖！只有荷马再生才能给他们一个公正的评价。戈弗雷，完美的士兵和领袖；博希蒙德，不择手段而又令人敬畏。坦克雷德，典型的游侠骑士；诺曼底的罗伯特，疯子似的英雄！这里面的素材那么丰富，甚至使人感觉自己不配去使用它们。面对真实的历史，要演绎出比这更精彩、更激动人心的故事，到底需要什么样的想象力呢？

但是，他的小说作品组成了多么出色的兄弟方阵啊！想想看吧，《十字军英雄记》是纯粹的传奇小说；《海盗》细致地描绘了赫布里底群岛的生活；《肯纳尔沃斯城堡》完美再现了伊丽莎白女王时期的英格兰；《蒙特罗斯传奇》幽默感十足。尤其值得一提的是，他写出这些出色的小说之时，身处一个粗俗的时代，却没有冒犯任何敏感的耳目，这不得不让人越来越认识到沃尔特·司各特的伟大与崇高，以及他为文学和人类做出了多么大的贡献。

出于这个原因，他的传记也很值得一读，那本书就跟他的小说在一个书架上。洛克哈特是他的女婿，也是仰慕他的朋友。最理想的传记作者应是一个能完全保持中立的人，有同理心，但是也得有坚定的决心说出绝对事实。人们也希望能看到一个人脆弱及人性化的一面，而不仅是它的反面。我不认为世界上多数人能跟我们传记书里的主人公一样好。当然，这些名人有时候也会骂脏话，或是特别喜爱漂亮的脸蛋，或者明明最多只能喝一瓶酒但还是开了第二瓶，或者做些什么事情让我们觉得他们就是我们的朋友和兄弟。传记倒不至于像某位女士描述她过世的丈夫那样开头：“D是一个肮脏的男人。”但是如果在其中能有更多明暗对比描写，书就会更好读，主人公也会更讨人喜爱。

但我确定，如果一个人对司各特了解得越多，就会越崇拜他。他生活在一个嗜酒的年代，在一个嗜酒的国家，我毫不怀疑他晚上有时会来一点托迪酒，这种酒足以把他那些虚弱的后辈放倒在桌子底下。这个可怜人，在他最后的岁月里总算是节制了些，当别人互相传递玻璃酒瓶的时候，他只是咂一口大麦汤。但他是一个多么高尚、多么有骑士精神的绅士啊！那么有幽默感，而且他不是将这种幽默感变成空洞的词语，而是将其转化成持续多年的劳作和克制。你们还记得他曾经成为一家出版社的匿名合伙人的事情吧，结果那家出版社倒闭了，把他也牵涉了进去。他负有法律上的责任，在道德上却没有任何责任，如果他当时宣称破产清空了账户，过几年就又能成为有钱人了，但是他把所有的重担挑在了自己肩上，以自己后半生的工作、时间和健康来洗刷自己的这个污点。那可是将近十万英镑。我想他最终把这些钱还给了债主，真是一个了不起的纪录啊，十万英镑，他把自己的命都投进去了。

而且他工作是多么卖力啊！简直就是超人。只有写小说的人才能理解，据说司各特只花了一年时间就写完了两部长篇小说。我记得在谁写的回忆录里读到—好像就是洛克哈特的书—说他住进了爱丁堡城堡街上的一个出租房间，整夜都能看到映在对面房间百叶窗上的身影。那个人整夜都在写作，那个身影一会儿就把桌上的纸拿到一边的纸堆上去。他出去参加了一个聚会，等他回来时，对面百叶窗上映着的手正在挪纸。第二天早上，他听说对面的房间住的就是沃尔特·司各特。

我们好奇地想一窥这位小说家的思想世界，却得知司各特写两部长篇之时—这两部还是他很不错的作品—健康状况糟到了一定程度，写完之后一个字都不记得了。后来别人给他读小说内容的时候，他像是在听别人写的书。显然，大脑最简单的运行机制，例如记忆能力，在此就失效了，但是大脑最高等、最复杂的功能—想象力，却处于巅峰，丝毫没有受损。这一事件非同寻常，值得我们好好想想。这也让每一个写创造性作品的作者有些同感，那就是，他最好的作品好像以某种奇怪的方式从自己头脑之外而来，他只是作为媒介将它们写在纸上。创造性的想法—更宏大创作的萌芽—像一颗子弹射进了他大脑之中。他也被自己的想法震惊了，好像它不是源于自己的大脑。在这里，我们看到的这个男人，大脑其他部分的功能都瘫痪了，但是却写出了杰出的作品。难道我们真的只是无限未知之力通往这世界的管道吗？实际上，面对我们最好的作品，我们从来都不觉得这是自我能力完成的。

如果沿着这个思路往下想，难道说不强健的身体和不稳定的神经系统—因为两者让人对物质享受的追求保持在最低的水平—使他成了精神创作领域更合格的代理人吗？有句古话是这样说的：

伟大的天才总是跟疯狂为邻，

它们之间只有非常薄的隔墙。

但是，撇开天才不谈，在我看来，运用想象力创作的人，就算才能一般，也会严重削弱灵魂与肉体之间的联系。

看看英国一个世纪之前的诗人们就知道了：查特顿、彭斯、雪莱、济慈，还有拜伦。彭斯是这一群人里面最年长的一位，但是他过世的时候只有三十八岁，“精力耗尽了”，他哥哥用了这样可怕的词语。雪莱死于意外，而查特顿是服毒而死，自杀本身就是精神状态颓靡的表现。虽然罗杰斯几乎活到了百岁老人的年纪，但他首先是个银行家，其次才是诗人。华兹华斯、丁尼生和布朗宁都提高了诗人的平均寿命，但是不知为何小说家的状况却很糟糕，尤其是最近几年。他们的寿命跟铅白工人或其他高危行业的工人一样短。例如，看看那些年轻美国人的例子吧，真是令人震惊。短短几年间，有多少前途无量的年轻人被带去了天国啊！写出《大卫·哈鲁姆》这部佳作的作者；还有弗兰克·诺里斯，我认为他比在世的大多数作家都更有成为伟大作家的潜质，我觉得他的《地坑》是最好的美国小说之一，他也是英年早逝；接着是斯蒂芬·克莱恩，他也写出了出色的作品；还有哈罗德·弗雷德里克，也是一位大师级作家。从规模和比例来说，世界上还有哪一个行业能有这种程度的损失呢？同时，我们自己国家也失去了罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森、亨利·西顿·梅里曼，以及其他很多人。

即便是我们常说的那些写作生涯圆满谢幕的作家，其实过世得也太早了。比如说，萨克雷，虽然他去世时已经满头白发，但其实才五十二岁；狄更斯活到了五十八岁；总的来说，世人应该感到庆幸，沃尔特·司各特爵士六十一岁才过世，而且他四十多岁才开始写小说，他的写作生涯比其他同人要长一些。

司各特有近二十年的创作时间，我想这跟莎士比亚差不多了。天才对他的生命只有有限的使用权，这位埃文河畔的诗人就是另一个例子，虽然我相信他比他的家人都活得久，这一家子人的健康状况都不好。我判断他死于某种神经方面的疾病，这一点从他逐渐难以辨认的签名就可以看出来。有可能是运动性神经官能症，对于运用想象力创作的人来说，这是特别容易染上的苦疾。海涅、都德，以及其他数不清的人都是这种病症的受害者。按照传统，他死后很久之后才首次公布他的死因，说他死于一次豪饮引发的高烧，这种说法一听就很荒唐，因为从科学角度来说可没有这种高烧。但是饮酒习惯有可能会引起慢性神经疾病，并造成灾难性后果。这一排绿色的书让我唠叨了很多题外话，但是在我讲下一个话题之前，关于司各特，我还有一点要说。如果不提他那奇怪的守口如瓶的个性，关于他性格的描述就无法完整。在很多场合，他不说真话，掩饰自己就是多部著名小说的作者，而且就算每天都能见到的亲密友人，也不知道他就是整个欧洲都在热议的人物。就连他妻子也不知道他还承担了金钱方面的法律责任，直到巴兰泰恩出版社倒闭之后，她才知道他们也是这次灾难的一分子。心理学家可能从他的小说中许多精灵似的费妮拉式人物身上找到他这种扭曲思想的踪迹，在他的很多小说中，这些人物在好几个章节里都是躲躲闪闪并且保守着他们令人恼火的秘密。

洛克哈特的《司各特传》，读来令人悲伤。读完之后，会让人情绪低落。看到这位疲惫的巨匠，他蹒跚前行，为债务所累，超负荷地工作，妻子过世了，情绪崩溃，唯有名誉尚存，这真是文学史上最为令人动容的描写。但这些阴云终会消散，最后留在世间的是对这位杰出伟人的回忆，他没有被命运压垮，到最后也直面人生，在自己的路上倒下时没发一声怨言。他写出了人类的每一种情感。他在世时无比喜乐，也获得了非凡的成功；他倒下时悲伤是那么苦涩，却也令人难忘。我想，在这世间，很少有人能比这位长眠在柴伯尔修道院墓地中的人更加伟大。





第三章


我们可以跟那一长列绿色封面的威弗利小说道个再见了，还有它们旁边洛克哈特的《司各特传》。接下来是四卷灰色封面的书，非常厚重，它们是鲍斯韦尔的著作《约翰逊博士传》，还是老式大字体版本。我要强调一下大字体版本，因为现在市面上大多数便宜版本的英文名著都有很大缺陷。如果读有点深奥难懂的古文书，你其实需要清晰美观的字体来让阅读过程更顺畅。字体太小的版本既考验眼睛，也考验耐心。所以，最好还是多花点钱，买一本读起来不费劲的书。

这部书勾起了我的兴趣—简直让我神魂颠倒，我是多么希望能欢快地加入歌颂这位善良的老坏蛋的人中间去。在这个问题上，我们很难听从他的建议—“清除思想中的偏见”，因为我们已经习惯了像麦考莱和鲍斯韦尔那样，戴着富有同情色彩的眼镜去看待他，要摘掉这副眼镜，擦亮双眼，用自己的眼睛去看这个人真正的言行、审视他的局限实在很难。一旦这么做，你会有一种很奇怪、很复杂的感觉。该如何表达它呢，就像被写进了文学里的约翰牛[19]—他的每一种特质，好的、坏的，都以漫画的方式被夸大了，而且夸大到了极点。他那颗善心的外面是粗糙的外壳：脾气火暴、傲慢、保守的狭隘主义、缺乏同情心和洞察力、粗鲁、武断、盛气凌人、宗教信仰根深蒂固又十分强硬。具有所有更粗犷、更暴躁的特点的约翰牛正是如今好脾气的约翰尼的曾祖父。

要是没有鲍斯韦尔这个人，我们不知要错过多少他这位伟大友人的事迹。他以一个苏格兰人的顽固坚持，向整个世界灌输了他的英雄崇拜情结。很显然，鲍斯韦尔本人就很崇拜司各特。这两个男人关系很好，而且这种关系对双方都有非常有益的影响。但是以外人的眼光来看，这两个人的关系并没有建立在稳定的基础上。当他们相识的时候，鲍斯韦尔二十三岁，约翰逊五十四岁。一个是对前辈无比恭敬而且易受影响的苏格兰青年；另一个则已是声名在外，属于上一辈的人。从他们见面的那一刻起，一方就对另一方有绝对的主导权，因此要让鲍斯韦尔客观地去评论约翰逊，简直比让儿子评判父亲还要难得多。直到最后，他们之间都未打破这种相处模式。

像麦考莱那样去贬低鲍斯韦尔倒是不难，不过鲍斯韦尔写出了英语文学中最好的传记，这事可不是巧合。他确实有些非凡而罕见的文学天赋。一是他文风生动清晰，比他崇拜的榜样的文风更灵活，更具有撒克逊特质。二是他非常审慎，令人敬佩，要写这样一部巨著，他每走一步都要留心脚下的陷阱，但就整本书的风格来讲，他几乎没犯任何错误。有人说，在私生活方面，他很愚蠢，是个花花公子。但在握笔之时，他可不是这样。在他与约翰逊的所有争论中，他总是小声地表达自己的异议，直到约翰逊咆哮出“不，先生”让他闭嘴。但是经验表明，他的观点大多更为智慧。在奴隶制的问题上，他错了。但根据我的记忆，在很多重要事件上，鲍斯韦尔的观点都被历史所证明，比如美国独立战争、汉诺威王朝、宗教宽容，等等。

然而，作为传记作者，鲍斯韦尔最厉害的一点就在于他会告诉你那些你想知道的小细节。很多时候，我们读完一部传记，却对那人的性格一无所知。但这部传记不是这样，约翰逊在书里活了过来。这里有一小段对约翰逊外貌的描写，不过这段不是出现在《约翰逊博士传》中，而是在《赫布里底群岛之旅》中，此书正是书架上的另一本。这段文字很典型，能代表他生动的风格。我想抄下来，给你们分享其中的一段：

他身形庞大，非常壮实，我觉得有点接近巨大，由于臃肿肥胖而显得很笨拙。他的面容有点像古代的雕像，但是由于“国王恶疾”[20]留下的疤痕有些变形。他现在六十四岁了，耳朵不太听得见了。他视力一直都不太好，但是他强大的精神主宰甚至弥补了器官功能的缺陷，他的感知力一直非同寻常地敏锐而准确。他的脑袋，有时候甚至是整个身子，会像是中风了似的摇晃。他好像经常被痉挛和抽搐困扰，应是由圣维特舞蹈病[21]所引起的错乱所导致。他穿着浅棕色的全套西装，戴着同色发夹，一顶大大的乱糟糟的灰色假发，一件素色衬衣，黑色精纺毛袜子，以及银色搭扣。在这次旅途中需要走路的时候，他就穿着靴子和宽大的棕色呢绒大衣，衣服口袋差不多能装进两大本他的词典，手里还拿着一根大大的英国橡木手杖。

你必须承认，如果看到了这番描述还不能设想出伟大的约翰逊的形象，那可就不能怪鲍斯韦尔了—而且这还只是他十几段同样生动描写的其中之一，让我们得以窥见他笔下主人公的样子。正是他文字描绘出的这些画面，那个身形庞大、性格粗鲁的男人，以他的抱怨和咆哮，他惊人的胃口，他的二十杯茶，他对橘子皮和路灯杆的特殊癖好[22]，让读者着迷，并且赋予了约翰逊远远多于他文学作品的魅力。

毕竟，约翰逊的哪部作品今天还能有生命力呢？肯定不是《拉赛拉斯王子漫游人生记》，它只不过是一部矫揉造作的浪漫主义小说。《诗人传》则只是一篇篇序言的合集，还有《漫步者》不过是由一些生命力短暂的散文组成。另有《英语辞典》一书，它庞大的工作量几乎令人难以忍受，耗费了约翰逊巨大的精力去做准备工作，是一座勤奋的丰碑，但它也需要非凡的才华。《伦敦》中有一些闪光的句子，《赫布里底群岛之旅》里面也有几页内容很精彩。这些东西，加上关于政治和其他方面的小册子，就是他一生创作出的主要作品。当然了，仅凭这些，实在让人无法认同他在英国文学史上居然占有重要的地位，因此，我们要从他的传记作者那里寻找答案，虽然这位作者地位低微，还经常被人嘲笑。

还有就是约翰逊的演讲。是什么让它如此与众不同呢？他针对每个话题所做的论述都那么自信满满。但是，这也表现出他狭隘、不容置疑的一面。对于任何有同情心和想象力的人而言这种品质都与其本性相悖。因为这样的人在对待任何问题时，都会考虑到另一面，也会认识到，我们被有无限可能性发生的海洋包围着，哪怕人类最伟大的知识，也只是一个孤立的小岛而已。看看他的狭隘都产生了什么后果吧。对于他那么多错得离谱的论断，我们这个沉闷的民族里有过一个人认定他错了吗？这让人想起了巴杰特说过的话，如果哪一天，全世界最博学的人的思想被复制到每一个人大脑里面，那将会产生极为荒谬的错误。有人问约翰逊博士“燕子是怎么过冬的”，这位权威的大师转了转眼珠，气喘吁吁地说道：“燕子嘛，当然是整个冬天都在睡觉。它们一群群地聚在一起，盘旋着飞啊飞，接着就一起猛地扎进了河水之中，然后就躺在了河床之上。”鲍斯韦尔庄重地将这一信息记录在案。不过，如果我没记错的话，有一位像塞尔伯恩的怀特[23]那么可信的博物学家，也对约翰逊解释的燕子的问题产生了疑惑。更让人觉得不可思议的是约翰逊对他同代作家的错误评判。在这一方面，我们本以为他能有点分寸呢，然而，他的结论对于现代读者来说，简直荒谬至极。“莎士比亚这个人，”他说，“从来没有连续写过六个好句子。”对于格雷的《墓园挽歌》，在这首精湛的诗作中，他只承认有两行还不错。而就算是非常苛刻的批评家，也只能在这首诗里找到两行不那么好的诗句。在他眼里，《项狄传》根本不可能流传于世；《哈姆雷特》全是废话；斯威夫特的《格列佛游记》水准不高，他最好的作品是《澡盆故事》；伏尔泰就是个文盲；卢梭是个无赖；像休谟、普利斯特里和吉本这样的自然神论者，都不是正直的人。

还有他对政治发表的见解，如今，它们听起来夸张极了。我想，就算在当时，这些言论也是非常反动的吧。“穷人毫无廉耻。”“查理二世是个好国王。”“政府应该把反对方的公职人员都辞退。”“应该鼓励印度的法官去做生意。”“没有哪个国家能靠贸易富起来。”（我怀疑他说这话的时候亚当·斯密[24]就在他旁边！）“土地所有者应该把那些不按他意愿去投票的佃农都撵出去。”“对于劳工而言，增加工资并不是件好事情。”“当某个国家出现贸易逆差的时候，必须用通行硬币支付差额。”这都属于他深信的言论。

他的偏见则更可怕！我们大多对某些事物有莫名的厌恶感，当我们比较宽容的时候，并不觉得这些情绪值得炫耀。但是看看约翰逊博士吧！如果把他厌恶的事物都消灭的话，世界上可就没剩多少东西了。他憎恶辉格党，不喜欢苏格兰人，鄙视不信奉国教的新教徒（一个加入他们教派的年轻女子被他说成是“龌龊的荡妇”）；他还很讨厌美国人。因此，他走在他自己狭窄的道路上，向道路左右猛烈地喷出愤怒之火。好在麦考莱对他的敬爱之情产生在他过世之后，如果麦考莱见过在世的约翰逊，那他肯定会跟约翰逊所憎恶的一切结成统一战线。

其实，并不是他的这些偏见有什么坚定的原则作为支撑，他也不是不能根据自己利益的需求而改变它们。这是他人生记录中的一个败笔。在他编纂的词典里，养老金和领取养老金的人受到了辱骂，将其比作美国以奴隶制禁锢了雇工的工具。当他写下这个不幸的词条的意思时，一定认为自己是绝不可能去领什么养老金的。但是，不久之后，当乔治三世通过政令，或许是出于施舍，给他提供了养老金的时候，他毫不犹豫地接受了。因此，我们可能会觉得他所表达的激烈见解，不过是他情绪激动的表现，在这种情况下，事实可能正好与此相反。

他特别爱说话—但是他的话更像是独白，是一篇离题万里的文章，偶尔才能看到被他压制的听众在边角处写几条注释。这个男人根本不许别人反驳他，也拒绝跟人一起讨论人生的关键问题，那别人怎么可能跟他进行平等的对话呢？戈德史密斯会为自己的文学观点而辩论吗？伯克会捍卫自己的辉格主义思想吗？或者，吉本会为自己的自然神论信仰而辩解吗？在他那里，没有哲学宽容意义上的共同立场，无法找到共同的论点。要是他不能跟人争论，他就会变得很无礼，用戈德史密斯的话说，就是：“如果他的手枪没射中，他就会用枪托把人给敲晕过去。”只要他一发出那“犀牛一样的大笑”，任何文明的探讨都无法继续了。拿破仑曾说欧洲其他国家的国王听到他的死讯时肯定会大叫一声“好”。可以想见，当约翰逊博士去世后，他周围的那些老一辈也肯定会松一口气，从此以后他们终于可以自由地说出心里的想法了，不会再听到那句危险的话“什么，先生，可不是这样”，要是再争辩下去，可能就变成了“这个话题到此为止”。当然，我们会想更深入地挖掘一下鲍斯韦尔的记录，去听一下伯克和雷诺兹这些人在可怕的博士不在场的时候都聊了些什么，那些夜晚，俱乐部里自由的氛围跟他在的时候是那么不同。

如果没有考虑他年轻时和中年早期的糟糕经历，任何关于他性格的评价都会有失公正。他的灵魂跟他的脸一样，遍布伤痕。国王给他养老金的时候，他已经五十三岁了。在那之前，他一直都在为基本生活需求挣扎，只为白天能有饭吃、晚上能有张床睡。他亲眼看到文学圈里的朋友因贫困而死。从童年时代开始，他从未感受过幸福的滋味。那个笨拙的年轻人，穿着肮脏的亚麻布衣服，瘸着腿，眼睛半瞎，无论是在利奇菲尔德街，还是在彭布罗克的四方院子，抑或是在伦敦的咖啡馆，都是人们怜悯和嘲笑的对象。他天性骄傲而敏感，因此，生命里的每一天都可能遭受到了令他痛苦的羞辱。这样的经历，要么让一个人精神颓废，要么使他心生怨愤，所以，这能解开他性格的秘密。正是因为这样，他才那么粗暴，那么不顾及别人的感受，鲍斯韦尔的父亲才会称他为“大熊星座”。假如他的性情真的在某些方面乖戾异常，我们也得承认，肯定是某种可怕的力量扭曲了他的本性。他天性纯良，缺点是糟糕的经历造成的。

他有许多可贵的品质。其中最主要的，要数他惊人的记忆力。他读的书不计其数，而且只要是他读过的，他都能记住，可不是像我们模糊地记个大概，而是能准确地记得读到的地方和时间。对他读过的诗歌，他背的时候还能记住是在哪一页，英语或拉丁语他都能记得。这么好的记忆力自然有许多好处，但是当你头脑里记的都是别人的东西时，怎么能有空间想出自己的新点子呢？我觉得，好的记忆力对于创作者来说是个致命的缺点，除了司各特和其他少数人例外。画石板首先必须是空白的，你才能把自己的见解写上去。约翰逊什么时候有过新颖的见解？他什么时候面向过未来，又什么时候为人类面对的困境提供过新的解决方案呢？他深为往昔所扰，脑中完全没有空间去想其他事。任何现代发展都没能在第一时间引起他的关注。在法国那场人类史上的大浩劫发生之前的几年，他曾经去过那里，但是他关注的都是些琐碎之事，完全没有捕捉到暴风来临的信号，按理说，他周围应该充满了提示才对。我们读到有一位和善的森斯特瑞里先生带约翰逊参观了酒厂，并且给他看了酒厂产量的数据。然而正是这位满嘴脏话的森斯特瑞里先生，在路易国王在断头台上说话时敲响了鼓点，淹没了国王最后的话。这两件事的联系，显示出这位贤者在不知不觉中离悬崖是那么近，而他的学识并没能令他发现危险的到来。

他有可能成为非常优秀的律师或神职人员。我甚至觉得，没有什么能阻挡他成为坎特伯雷主教或是上议院议长。他记忆力惊人、学识丰富、品格正直，对虔诚和正义怀有坚定的信念，这些品质都能把他送上这两个行当的最高位置。虽然他有自己的局限，但不可否认，他才智非凡。他针对苏格兰法律相关问题的见解就是最好证明，他将这些看法告知了鲍斯韦尔，后者在苏格兰法官面前将其陈述出来。对于一个没有受过训练的外行来说，能在那么短的时间内写出这种论据充实、理由充分且具有分量的见解，我觉得，跟文学创作一样是惊人的杰作。

总的来说，他本质上是一个善良的人，这就非常不错了。他广施仁慈，而且在自己时常拮据的情况下这么做。他家里的房间变成了一些受尽苦难的人的最后避难所，比如失明的莱韦特先生、刻薄的威廉姆斯女士，以及淡漠的德姆林斯女士，他们都是生病的老人，对任何人来说，跟他们一起生活都不容易。遇到穷困的朋友，他随时都能奉上兜里的基尼[25]。年轻的诗人总能找他为新诗集作序，不管这位诗人多么籍籍无名，序言前面还会有乏味又浮夸的献词，完全就是其作者的风格。这位先生有些粗野，但很善良，他会把街上穷苦的拉客妓女扛在肩上背回家，这会让人忘记俱乐部里面那个武断又爱卖弄学问的博士先生，或者，至少会原谅他吧。

我总觉得看伟人怎么对待衰老和死亡，是一件有趣的事情。这能检测他的人生哲学究竟有多健全。休谟很早就预见了死亡，平淡而安静地接纳了它。但是约翰逊一想到这个可怕的对手就怕得要命。他晚年的书信和谈话中充斥着无尽的恐惧。并不是他胆子小，从外表看，他可以说是有史以来最勇敢的人之一。他有非凡的勇气。那种表现其实是他精神上的不自信所致，何况他真相信死后还有另一个世界，虽然有更为仁爱和自由的神学观削弱了这种信仰的影响力。他那么绝望地守住自己疯狂的身体，看起来真是令人惊诧。身上染有痛风、哮喘、圣维特舞蹈病，体内还有六加仑的水肿积液！当一个人每天要花八个小时在椅子里呻吟，另外十六个小时要在床上哼哧哼哧地喘气，这种生活有什么好留恋的呢？“我愿意用一条腿换取一年的寿命。”他这么说。不过，当最后的钟声终于敲响的时候，他却比谁都体面和勇敢。你想说他的不好随便说，不喜欢他这个人也行，但是每当你打开这灰色的四卷本开始阅读的时候，这部作品总能启发你的思维，激发你读书的愿望，让你拥有关于人性与人格的洞见，帮你成为一个更善良、更有智慧的人。





第四章


在约翰逊文集旁边，放着吉本的作品，可能你想不到，我有两个版本，因为我之前收藏的那个全集版本在印刷字体上有点毛病，所以我实在无法抗拒伯里[26]编注的新版六卷本《罗马帝国衰亡史》。在读这部书的时候，你可不会希望遇到任何阻碍，必须字体清楚，纸张干净，书也不能太重。但是读的时候可不轻松，你会带着诚挚的目的和对知识的渴望，手边还会放着一本古典地图册和一个笔记本，慢慢地进入内容，并不时翻回到之前的部分，以便牢记看过的内容，并将其与接下来的信息联系起来。这部书中没有什么惊心动魄的紧张感。读这部书既不会让你整夜不眠，也不会让你在白天忘记跟别人的约会，但是在读的过程中，你会感受到一种沉静的喜悦，而读完之后，你得到的东西将永远不会失去—货真价实、清晰确切的知识，你所得到的知识会让你成为一个视野更开阔、思想更深刻的人。

如果我被罚要在一座荒岛上待一年，只能带一套书做伴，那我肯定会选吉本的这部书。它视角广阔，其中蕴藏了多么丰富的精神食粮啊！它讲述了一千年间的历史事件，内容翔实、好看而准确。总体而言，它的观点富有哲理，文采斐然。我们现在的写作手法灵活多样，会觉得他的风格过于浮夸。但是要知道，他那个年代，我们的文学创作已经被约翰逊时期的浮夸文风腐化了。对我个人而言，我并不讨厌吉本浮夸的文风。如果一段文字要描述罗马军团进军，或是希腊议员辩论的场景，那这段文字就必须要有韵律而且铿锵有力。有这样清醒而公正的魂灵在一旁支持你、指导你，你会觉得自己升到了空中，下方就是交战的各国、冲突的各族、王朝的兴衰，以及各种信仰的分歧。你平静地飘在上方，这一连串的画面在下面一一掠过，始终有个严肃、慎重而平和的声音在轻轻告诉你这些场景的真正含义。

这是有史以来最宏大的故事。在开头，你会读到对罗马帝国的描述，罗马早期诸帝统治时，罗马是公认的“世界霸主”。接下来，你不断读到一连串皇帝的奇闻逸事，在那些逸事中，那些皇帝时而是伟大的明君，时而是挥霍无度的昏君，偶尔还会是丧心病狂的暴君。帝国的衰败从上层开始，过了几个世纪才腐化到拿长矛的战士。虽然罗马帝国接受了基督教的信仰，但是主张和平的宗教信仰也没影响到它，罗马帝国的历史仍由鲜血铸就。新信仰不过是给已有的诸多争吵和暴行提供了新理由，比起宗派成员引发的动荡，愤怒族群之间的混战倒可以算得上温和了。

然后，从外部刮来了一阵强劲的疾风，它来自“世界的荒地”，具有非凡的破坏力，搅乱一切，疯狂地横扫旧秩序，在身后只留下被撕裂的乱世，但是这股力量也终于清除了所有陈旧和腐败的势力。暴风的中心在中国北方的某个地方，它突然出现，并且有可能再次出现。人类这座火山猛地喷发出来，掀掉了山顶，将整个欧洲都笼罩在了它毁灭性的残屑碎片之下。然而荒诞的是，并不是征服者推翻了罗马帝国，而是蜂拥而至的难民，他们无比惊慌，就像是受惊狂奔的兽群，破坏掉挡路的一切。那是一个风云变幻的狂野时代，那一时期，欧洲的现代民族开始形成。各民族从北方和东方群拥而至，如同沙尘暴袭来。从表面看，局势一片混乱，但是每一个民族都在彼此融合，从而让整体更加强大。善变的高卢人从法兰克人那里学到了稳重，沉着的撒克逊人从诺曼人那里学习了精致的品位，与伦巴第人和东哥特人的融合让意大利人焕发了新的生机，腐败的希腊人被果敢而诚挚的伊斯兰教徒取代了。在每个地方，都似乎有一只伟大的手在把不同的种子混合在一起。因此，我们只能说战争已经变成了民族大迁徙。不过，书里并没有预言到在大西洋的对岸有什么了不起的新事物也正在崛起。当你在一个盎格鲁—凯尔特人的大本营看到新加入的意大利人、匈奴人和斯堪的纳维亚人的时候，你会觉得任何一种人类品格都可以在这里演化出来。

好了，让我们回到吉本的话题上：下一阶段是从罗马帝国到拜占庭帝国，就像是盎格鲁—凯尔特民族未来的中心落在了芝加哥或多伦多。奇怪的是，伊斯兰教迅速从南方涌来，淹没了整个北非，从东到西一方面传遍了整个印度大陆，另一方面还传遍了整个西班牙，直到越过拜占庭[27]的城墙，将这个基督教的堡垒变成了穆斯林在欧洲的至高要塞。这就是讲述世界已知历史大半内容的宏大文本，而这些知识只需要通过推荐给你的那份地图、一支铅笔和笔记本就可以为你所有。

当一切都很有意思的时候，就很难挑出例子来，但是对我来说，每当一个新的民族初次登上历史舞台的时刻，最令我印象深刻。这就像是伟人年轻时环绕在他身上的那种魅力光环。还记得俄国人的初次登场吗？他们带着那么多大炮沿河而下来到博斯普鲁斯海峡，在那里试图登上帝国的大帆船。奇特的是，一千年过去之后，俄国人仍然在为实现他们那些身穿兽皮的祖先没能完成的事业而努力。然后是突厥人，你可能还记得他们开创功业初期特有的凶悍。他们中某些人身负君主赋予的使命。这座城市被蛮族围困，从陆路进入的入口也被封锁。而这些亚洲战士擅自离开部族加入了一次遭遇战。第一个突厥人冲了出去，拉开弓箭射死了一个蛮族战士，然后俯下身去吸吮这人的鲜血。这一幕让死者的同袍无比惊恐，难以鼓起士气再跟这样诡异的对手作战。这两个强悍的民族分别从相反的两个方向来到同一个城市，所以说，这座城会成为一方的重镇，也会成为另一方延绵数个世纪的梦想。

另外，那些从欧洲消失的民族，要比这些登场的民族更有意思，能够最大限度地激发想象力。比如，曾经征服过北非的汪达尔人，他们是日耳曼人的一支，有着蓝色眼睛和淡黄色的头发，原来生活在易北河地区。突然之间，他们也染上了当时普遍流行的漫游狂热症。他们选择了一条抵抗力量最弱的路线—通常都是从北向南、从东到西，汪达尔人却往西南方向去了。继续走这条路必定是出于对冒险的纯粹热爱，因为如果他们的目标是找到安居之所，在他们走过的上千英里路程中，途中就有许许多多这样美好的地方。

他们穿过了法国南部，征服了西班牙，最后又冒险去了非洲，在那里占领了一个罗马帝国的老行省[28]。就像是英国占领过印度一样，他们在那里据守了两三代人，现在那里还有不少他们的后裔。就在这时，罗马帝国发出了一点火光，告诉人们灰烬之中尚存余火。贝利萨留[29]在非洲登陆，重新夺回了这个行省。汪达尔人的海路被切断了，因此只能往内陆逃。他们能继续保有蓝眼睛和淡黄色头发的特征吗？他们是被黑人消灭了，还是与他们融合在一起了？旅行者带回了传说：在月亮山那一带有一族黑人，瞳孔和头发的颜色都很浅。有没有可能这里面有那个消失的日耳曼族的影子呢？

这个例子让人想起在格陵兰岛的一个类似的部族，他们也消失了。我一直觉得这是历史上最浪漫的谜团之一，尤其是每当我的眼睛努力越过格陵兰岛[30]海岸的大片浮冰，看向古老的“埃里拜吉亚人”曾经的定居点之时。那里曾有一座斯堪的纳维亚人的城市，是由来自冰岛的殖民者建立的，发展得颇具规模，他们还向丹麦申请了一位主教过来。那还是十四世纪的事。主教准备履职，却发现自己无法成行了，由于气候变化，格陵兰岛和冰岛之间的海峡被融化的冰山填满了。从那时起，再也没有人能确切地说出那些古老的斯堪的纳维亚人到底怎么了，要知道，那时他们可是欧洲最有文化、最先进的部族。或许他们被爱斯基摩人和他们轻视的斯格雷林人打垮了，亦或许跟他们融合在了一起，也有可能他们仍然自给自足地生活着。因为就算是现在，人们对那片海岸地区仍然知之甚少。假如南森和皮尔利那样的探险家在这里偶然发现了老定居点的遗迹，或是在这种细菌无法生存的环境里找到消逝文明留下的完整木乃伊，那将会很奇妙。

但是，我们还是再回到吉本的话题上吧。吉本先做了计划，然后连续劳作了二十年，终于完成了这项伟大的工程，真是一位伟人！无论是多么不知名的古典学者，多么啰唆的拜占庭历史学家，写得多么潦草的修道士编年史，都被他吸收进他的书中，在庞大的整体框架中找到了合适的位置。要完成这么巨大的工程，需要无比勤奋、有毅力，以及专注细节；但是珊瑚虫也有这些优点，不过大家却并不会注意到这种组成珊瑚礁的个体。同样，作品的创造者本人吉本也没有得到足够的关注，甚至被忽视了。在知晓吉本著作的一千人中，可能只有一个在意过吉本本人是什么样。

总的来说，事实正是如此。有的人比他们的作品伟大。他们的作品只是呈现了其人格的某一个方面，作为一个复杂而独特的人，他们身上可能还有许多出色又不可分割的特质。但吉本不是这样。他是个冷血动物，似乎他的智力太过发达，以致情感能力受损。我想不起他一生中除了对古典著作，还对什么产生过极大的冲动，或是强烈的热情。他高超的判断力从来没有被情感所蒙蔽，或者说他的感情从来都处于意志力的良好控制之下。还有什么能比这更值得称道呢—或者说，还有什么比这更不讨人喜欢呢？他遵从父命，抛弃了心上人，然后总结说“作为情人，我只能叹息；作为儿子，我只能服从”。他父亲过世后，他以这样的话语记录了这件事：“儿子的眼泪从来都不长久。”法国大革命的可怕景象只在他脑海里激起了自怜的情绪，因为他去瑞士度假的地方被愁眉苦脸的避难者给侵占了，就像是一个坏脾气的英格兰乡绅抱怨说观光客让他不胜其烦。在鲍斯韦尔所有描述吉本的文字里，都透露出一丝厌恶之情，他甚至经常都不提吉本的名字，如果我们不理解其中的缘由，就无法真正读懂这位历史学家的一生。

我觉得可能没有人像爱德华·吉本一样，生来就有那么完备的条件，能达到自我满足。他拥有成为大学者所需的每一种天赋，对任何学问都有永不满足的渴求，还特别勤奋，记忆力惊人，而且有一种温和开通的哲人性格，这使他能够超越派别局限，保持中立态度评述人世间的各种事件。在他的时代，对他的普遍评价是他在宗教思想方面偏见很深，但是对于现代哲学来说，他的见解却并不陌生，在如今这个更自由（也更公正）的社会里，并不会伤害到民众的感情。我们翻到百科全书里他的那一页，来看看对他的观念的最新评价。“第十五和十六章的内容完全没有必要详述，”给他立传的作者如此说，“因为在当下这个年代，任何一个基督教辩护士都无法否认，吉本所提出的那些重要指控，大部分都是事实。基督徒可能会抗议说他们在某些情形下遭受的压迫足以影响整体结论，并且他们一定会抗议说对基督徒的那种指控完全是不公平的。但是，他们也不再那么顽固了，能听得进去那些合情理的证据，那些证据表明基督徒受到的压迫并不像人们曾经认为的那么残酷。他们还慢慢接受了吉本提出的次要因素[31]论点的正确性，哪怕类似观点来自比吉本还讨厌的人，他们也能够让步。事实上，正如这位历史学家自己承认的那样，他所阐述的对基督教的建立和发展起到了推动作用的次要因素，根本没有触及基督教的源头究竟是自然还是超自然。”这些话说得不错，但一个世纪以来泼在我们这位历史学家身上的脏水可怎么算呢？至少得号召一下给已经过世的人道个歉吧。

从体形上来说，吉本的个子很小，跟约翰逊博士的大个子一样，都令人印象深刻，不过他们两人身体上的疾病倒有些怪异的相似处。约翰逊博士年轻时就深受溃疡和“国王恶疾”的困扰，王室恩典也没能治好这病。吉本给我们简洁地描述了自己的少年时代，极富戏剧性。

我连续被嗜睡和发烧症状折磨，身体一边消瘦下去，一边又水肿，这主要是因为我接连经历了神经收缩、眼瘘，还被一只狗咬了，这只狗凶得厉害，大家都怀疑它是一只疯狗。每位医生都被请来过，给我治病的钱花了太多太多，尤其是付给药剂师和手术医生的钱。有段时间，我吃的药比吃的饭还要多，直到现在，手术刀、疮口和腐蚀药剂在我身体上留下的伤疤还无法消除。

这就是吉本令人伤感的描述。那时，这种遗传慢性疾病在英格兰非常普遍，我们统称为腺病。我不知道那时盛行了近一个世纪的豪饮习惯跟这种病有没有关系，也不好说腺病跟博学有什么关联。但是，我们只需要将吉本描述的症状跟约翰逊博士的神经性抽搐、满是疤痕的脸，以及博士的圣维特舞蹈病对照起来，我们就会发现这两位当时英国的顶尖作者都深受同一种恶疾的残害。

我不知道吉本在南汉普顿民兵团当中尉时的画像是否还存留于世。他骨架小，脑袋很大，脸胖而圆，身上还穿着看起来十分招摇的军装，真是圆钉子往方洞里塞，太不合适了！他父亲是一个和他完全不同类型的人，拥有军衔，所以也让可怜的吉本成为一名士兵，而没有让他成为他自己。战争爆发了，吉本所在的兵团被集结起来，他深感绝望，这个倒霉的学者不得不一直在军队待到战争结束。在长达三年的时间里，他与自己的书隔绝了，他也曾大声而痛苦地表达过愤恨。南汉普顿民兵团从未与敌军碰过面，这对士兵们来说倒是件好事。就连吉本自己都取笑过他们；但是在兵营里待了三年，可能他手下的士兵对这位书呆子中尉开的玩笑要比吉本取笑他们的时候要多得多。他用起笔来比用剑要顺手得多。让他抱怨的事中还有一件就是，他的上校以身作则，鼓励他们每天都大量饮酒，有时候还会酗酒，这让他得了痛风。“日子过得要么忙碌，要么闲散，完全没有高雅的活动来补偿逝去的时光。”他说，“我的性情也不知不觉地被这群粗鲁的军官给带坏了，他们都缺乏学者的知识和绅士风度。”想想看，吉本在军官食堂的饭桌上，周围尽是喝高了的家伙，他自己也喝得脸通红，那是多么奇特的画面。然而，他自己也承认在当兵的这段日子里，并不只是吃到了苦头，也收获了许多慰藉。军旅生活让他再次成为一个英国人，改善了他的健康状况，也改变了他的思路。作为一名历史学家，这段军旅经历对于他也颇有助益。对此，他有一句话很出名也很典型：“现代军营的纪律和演变，让我更清楚地了解了古罗马军队的方阵和军团，对于一个研究古罗马历史的学者来说，在汉普顿步兵团做中尉的那段生涯并非毫无用处。”

我们不了解吉本的全部人生，那并不是他的错，他对自己职业生涯的描述不下六处，但是每一处都不一样，每一处都写得很差。一个人要写好自传，那可需要比吉本有更多的勇气和热情。写自传是所有人类创作中最难的一种，要求作者圆滑、审慎，还要坦诚，这些特质又几乎是一个人不可能兼具的。虽然吉本接受的是外国教育，但从很多方面来看，他是一个典型的英国人，内敛、自尊，有身为英国人的自觉。英国人的自传从不坦诚，因此英国自传从来都不是很好看。在我的印象中，特罗洛普的自传算优秀的了，但是在所有文学创作类别里，它跟我们的国民气质最不相符。你很难想象一个英国的卢梭，更不可能有英国的本韦努托·切利尼[32]。从某种角度来说，这是由于民族荣誉感所致。如果我们也像我们的这些邻居一样做了坏事，至少我们的可取之处在于还有羞耻心，并且不会把它出版成书。

在吉本作品的左边，是典藏版《皮普斯日记》（布雷布鲁克爵士的版本）。说实话，这可算是用英语写成的最伟大的自传了，但并不是作者有意写成这样。当皮普斯[33]先生日复一日地把脑子里那些稀奇古怪又微不足道的想法写在本子上时，要是有人来告诉皮普斯，他正在写一部英国文学史上独一无二的著作，他准会大吃一惊。但是他这部无心而为的自传，虽然创作初衷并不明确，或是为了自己以后参照，而且也从未想过要出版，在这个类别的文学创作中，它的首创性相当于鲍斯韦尔写的传记和吉本写的历史学著作。

我们这个民族总是太害怕暴露自我，所以无法写出好看的自传。我们讨厌别人说我们虚伪，但是在所有的民族当中，我们最不能坦诚地面对自己的情感—特别是对其中某些方面。比如说，一个人对待感情的态度能反映出他的性格，而且也会深刻地改变他的生活—要不然那些人的自传都是什么内容填满的呢？但在吉本身上，这件事的缺席却并不那么要紧，除了对未来的内克尔夫人有过极为克制的激情之外，他的心从来没给他带来过太多麻烦。所以，当吉本讲述自己的故事时，他总会试着让自己体面些。然而一个人越体面，也就会越无趣。卢梭可以自证为一个感情脆弱的浪荡子。切利尼会觉得自己是个好色的流氓而心有不安。他们虽然都不那么体面，但不妨碍他们成为真实而有趣的人。

关于皮普斯先生，有一点非常有意思，就是他能把自己成功地塑造成一个小人物，而实际上，他品格高尚，而且各方面造诣颇高。谁能想到在他日记里读到的都是些琐碎的评论，他晚饭餐点的目录，以及家里那些毫无意义的私事呢—而这又正因为其空洞琐碎而更加有趣了！这让人觉得他就是戏里那种性格怪异的人：大惊小怪，自以为是，对女人大喊大叫，在男人面前又很胆怯，穿得很好，钱包鼓鼓的，在政治和宗教问题上两面讨好，对一些琐碎之事永远都是唠叨不停。虽然他每一天的形象是这样，可是经年累月地看来，他又是另一种形象：尽责的公职人员，口才一流的演说家，优秀的作家，才华横溢的音乐家，同时也是一个藏书颇丰的学者，他总共收藏了三千册图书—这在那个年代可是不小的私人藏书量—而且他还很有为公众服务的精神，死后把藏书都捐赠给了大学。要知道，在伦敦大瘟疫最严重的时期，老皮普斯是唯一一个坚守自己岗位的海军军官，鉴于此，你应该能原谅他那些风流事。虽然他可能是个懦夫，或者说他确实是，但是，一个懦弱的人因责任心而努力去战胜自己的懦弱，这就是人类表现出来的真正勇气。

不过有意思的是，从来没人知道皮普斯到底为什么要用速记密码把每天发生的那些琐碎杂事都记下来，不仅如此，他还记下了自己那些不光彩的事情，换作任何人，肯定巴不得把这些事情忘掉。这本日记他写了十年之久，似乎因为他视力不行了才停下，潦草的速记字迹让他的视力衰退严重。我想，在他眼里，写起或读起这些速记，和读写普通的文字早已没什么差别了。即便如此，写完这么多本奇怪的速记手稿也非常耗费精力。是为了给自己的生命留下纪念，让自己区别于世间其他人吗？如果是这样，那他在把藏书赠给剑桥大学的时候，应该会将日记托付给一个人去保管，然后可以指定一个日期，在他死后将日记公布。但是他并没有提到自己的日记，若不是某位学者的聪明才智和坚持不懈，这些日记根本不会被人读到，可能现在还在皮普斯图书馆某个书架的顶层积灰呢。所以说，他并不想公开日记。那究竟是什么原因呢？唯一的可能就是为了给自己做参考，方便查阅信息。从他的性格中，我们可以观察到一个有趣的现象，就是他对方法和秩序有一种执着，总在估算自己到底有多少财产，为自己的藏书分类，把财产列出清单。可以想见，如此系统地记录自己好与不好的言行，也是类似的道理，出于一种对条理的病态迷恋。这么解释可能有点牵强，但是实在很难再想出别的原因了。

皮普斯的读者可能会对他日记中的一个小细节印象深刻，那就是那时的英国是一个多么热爱音乐的国家。几乎每个人都会一门乐器，很多人甚至会好几门乐器。多声部合唱团也很普遍。查理二世的时代没有多少值得我们羡慕的东西，但至少在这一点上，他们似乎比我们更有优势。那可是真正的音乐—优雅而柔情—歌词也配得上这种评价。那种对音乐的狂热可能是中世纪宗教改革之前最后的遗风了。我在别处读到过，说在中世纪宗教改革之前英国的教堂合唱团在整个欧洲都享有盛名。这可真是件怪事，要知道，在过去一个世纪里，英国连一个一流音乐大师都没出现过！

到底发生了什么国家变革，把音乐从这片土地上赶走了呢？难道是生活太严肃了，歌声已成其中的绝唱？在气候宜人的南部地区，你可以看到穷人也会开心地唱起歌来，但是在英格兰，穷人嗓子里唱出歌来通常说明他绝对是喝醉了。值得慰藉的是，只要得到适当的滋养和培育，这古老力量的种子一定会发出新芽。在旧时的天主教时期，我们拥有欧洲最好的合唱团，同样地，我相信我们现在也拥有整个欧洲最好的交响乐团体。至少，一家德国报纸最近访问了英格兰北部的一个合唱团之后，写下了这样的报道。但是在读皮普斯的日记时，我们难免会感慨，热爱音乐的氛围已经远不如从前了。





第五章


从塞缪尔·皮普斯说到乔治·博罗[34]，这个跨越可真够大的，从人类性格的一个极端到了另一个极端，但是在我放最喜欢的作家的作品那层书架上，博罗和皮普斯的作品是紧挨着的。我觉得康沃尔[35]真是一片神奇的土地，它狭长的半岛伸入海洋，捕捉到了漂浮着的各种奇珍异事，然后独守着它们，直到将它们融入康沃尔人的性格之中。到底是什么潜伏在康沃尔人的血液中，让这里不时就会出现一个令全世界惊奇的伟人，而且他身上完全没有任何英国人的行事特点和容貌特征。他肯定不是凯尔特人，也不是肤色较深的古伊比利亚人。这种血脉一定源自更远更深的地方。会不会是闪米特人，腓尼基人，那些四处游荡的提尔居民呢？他们有高贵的南部人的面孔和东方民族的想象力，在游荡的漫长时光里，他们忘记了蓝色的地中海，定居在了有花岗石的北海边上。

亨利·欧文[36]那张俊美的脸和强大的个性来自何方呢？多么激烈，多么美好，多么不像撒克逊民族！我只知道他母亲是个康沃尔人。勃朗特姐妹强烈而灿烂的想象力来自哪里呢？她们的想象力跟前辈奥斯汀女士的那种平静是多么不同。再次，我只知道她们的母亲是康沃尔人。乔治·博罗这个精灵一样的人是从何而来呢？他鹰一样的脑袋，长在岩石般结实的肩膀上，面部肤色是棕色的，头发颜色很浅，在众人中，他像是一个国王。他那张俊美的脸和让他在文学方面得到如此地位的智力天赋，都是哪里来的呢？又一次，我知道了他父亲是个康沃尔人。是的，在那个伸向西边海洋的伟大半岛之下，确实潜伏着一些奇特、怪异，并且强大的东西。如果博罗愿意，他可以称自己为东盎格鲁人—“英国人中的英国人”，他会喜欢这么命名—但是，在这样一个有康沃尔血脉的东盎格鲁人身上看到的那些奇异特质，难道是个巧合吗？他的出生是个巧合，但他那些不同寻常的特质有着世界起初的微光。

有些作家会让我退缩，因为他们写得太多了，让我觉得我无论如何都无法读透他们的书。所以我干脆就不碰他们的书了，就算这样有点懦弱。比如，巴尔扎克，他就写了一百多本书。人们说他有的书是杰作，但其余都是些骗钱的东西，但是究竟哪些是杰作哪些是烂书，人们也没达成共识。人生有限，为这样的作家花时间似乎有点不值当。他对人要求太多，以至于让人什么都不想给他了。还有大仲马，我站在他的作品旁，看到他那浩繁的作品，每次总是觉得抽一本读读就差不多满足了。但是你不会对博罗有这样的抱怨。哪怕是悠闲地去读，你也可以在一个月内把他写的东西全都读完。他的书有《拉文格罗》《圣经在西班牙》《罗曼·罗依》，如果你还想读得深一点，还有《狂野的威尔士》。他只写了这四本书—也没有什么太大的名气，但是，在英语文学中，没有其他的这么特别的书。

他是个很奇怪的人，顽固、偏执、强硬，经常绷着脸，完全是个刚愎自用的男人。就此来说，他的性格并不足以让他进入赢家行列。但是，他有一种很了不起、很罕有的天赋。在他一生中，他一直对生活保持着极大的好奇心和神秘感，一般说来，这种孩子般的感觉很快就会变得迟钝。但是他不仅自己维持着这种感觉，还通过大师级的文字让读者去重新找回它。读他的书时，你不禁会透过他的眼睛去看世界，而他所见所闻的，从来没有无趣和乏味的东西。一切都那么奇特，那么神秘，总有更深层的含义有待被发掘。如果他记下了他跟一个洗衣妇人的谈话，他的话里肯定有非常有趣的东西，而她的回答一定也很奇特。如果他写在酒吧里遇到了某个男人，那我们读了他的文字之后，肯定会想更多地了解一下那个男人。假如他来到一个城镇，他看到的东西，并且他让你看到的—绝不会是普通的房屋和破落的街道，而会是非常奇特而美妙的东西—蜿蜒流淌的河流，壮丽的桥梁，古老的城堡，死亡的阴影。每一个人，每一样东西，都不仅仅为自己存在，而是往昔时光的象征和纪念物。博罗的目光穿透某人，看到的是那个人所代表的一切。从名字可以看出那个人是威尔士人吧？接着，这个人瞬间就被忘掉了，博罗拖上你，跟着他的思维走了，看到古老的布立吞人、入侵的撒克逊人、从未听说过的游吟诗人、欧文·格伦道尔[37]、山里的突袭队，以及上千种有趣的事物。或者那个人的名字是丹麦的？博罗立刻把这个人留在了乏味的现代生活中，自己的心已飞向了在海斯发现的巨大头骨（我要插一句，我仔细研究过那些头骨，我觉得它们完全低于正常人类的标准）、维京人、巴萨卡战士[38]、瓦兰吉人、哈罗德·哈德拉德，以及教皇不变的邪恶。对博罗来说，所有的道路都通向罗马。但是，要我说，这个人写出了多好的英语文字啊！他怎么就把风琴悠扬的曲调编进了句子里呢！它是那么不同寻常、充满活力、栩栩如生！

如果你有幸能听得出散文里的音乐旋律，那么你在博罗文章中的每一行里都将找得到音乐的节奏。例如，在《拉文格罗》的一个章节里，他描写了在山沟里扎营的时候，心里突然涌起的极大恐慌。描述这段经历的人，真正继承了班扬和笛福的衣钵。另外，我们还要仔细观察他写作的艺术，他的叙述固然简略，但是注意—“山沟”这个词被刻意地重复了几次，营造了一种奇妙而诡异的氛围，它们就像乐曲中反复出现的主旋律。此外，还可以拿《圣经在西班牙》这本书末尾篇章中描写不列颠的文字做例子。要不是我自己的描述实在乏味，表现不出它的精彩，我真不喜欢从这种好作品里直接摘引文字。好吧，无论如何，请允许我把这段美妙而激扬的文字摘抄在这里：

噢，英格兰！愿你荣耀的太阳永不落进那黑暗浪涛之中！虽然阴暗、不祥的乌云正迅速在你身边聚集，但是，但是蒙主喜悦，上帝会将它们驱散，并赐予你更长久的昌盛，更辉煌的声望。或者，就算你末日将近，也愿你死得壮烈，配得起海上老女王这个名号！愿你在鲜血与火焰里沉没—如果你真的会沉没，也要拉下不止一个国家与你共赴灭亡！愿主喜悦，免除你的厄运，让你不致可耻地、缓慢地灭亡；在你消亡之前，将斥责与嘲讽加在居心不良的仇敌身上，即便他们嫉妒你、憎恶你，他们仍然敬畏你，即便有违他们的本心，他们还是将荣耀与尊崇献给你……除去你身边的假先知，因为他们所见只有虚空，口中只有谎言；他们用未泡透的灰抹墙，这灰是要落尽的；他们说看到了和平的异象，但却并没有和平；他们让恶人的手得力，让善人的心忧伤。就如此行事吧，不要害怕结局，因为你要么在别人的羡慕中悲壮地倒下，要么上帝会让你永远拥有海上霸权，海上老女王！

或者拿与“燃烧的铁皮人”的那场战斗做例子。这一段太长了，无法在此摘引，但是去读读吧，每个词都不要放过。在我们的语言里，还有哪里能找到比这更有力、更凝练、更克制的描写呢？我亲眼见过许多壮烈的战役，见过不止一场两国交战，两个国家里最优秀的人被挑选出来与对方作战，但是博罗的描写却让我更生动地回想起战斗的场景，远比我自己的记忆生动。这就是文字的魔力。

他也是个很厉害的拳击手。除了在文学圈，他在其他圈子里的名声也很大，那些圈里的人要是知道他是个作家准会大吃一惊。他天生就有优势，六点三英尺的身高，敏捷得像只斗鸡，在拳击场上肯定能吓倒对手。但是他打拳击也很讲究科学方法，我听说他有一种独特的懒散的套路。他很钟情这项运动—他是那么敬慕拳击手！你记得他写过的那些小短文吗？文中描写的都是他的英雄。如果不记得，那我必须引用一则，如果还记得，那你再读一遍也一定会非常高兴。

那是克里布，英格兰冠军，也许是英格兰最棒的男人。他就在那儿，身形庞大，那张脸多么像狮子的脸。还有贝尔彻也进入了他的地盘，年轻的图瑟·贝尔彻没那么强壮，但他是拳击场上最讲究科学打法的拳击手，只是我说不清他到底想怎样运用力量。他现在像是要从我面前走过，那天晚上他也是这样，戴着白色帽子，穿着白色大衣，体形瘦削而彬彬有礼，步伐雀跃，目光炽烈而坚定。与向他迎面走来的那个人形成了多么大反差啊！那是阴沉而野蛮的谢尔顿，对任何人都没有一句好话，但是随时都能给人一记重拳。太有力了！吃了他强壮手臂挥出的一拳，就算是巨人也会失去知觉。那边还有一个，正在闲逛呢，双手背在身后，支撑着棕色大衣的垂边儿，他个子太小了，看上去完全不像一个拳击手，但他可是轻量级之王，他就是传说中的兰德尔！可怕的兰德尔，身体里流着爱尔兰人的血，这没让他更好，也没更坏。离他不远的是内德·特纳，兰德尔上一局的对手，虽然内德败了，但仍然觉得自己是个优秀的拳手，或许确实是这样，因为比分非常接近。我怎么可能把他们每一个都介绍完呢？他们总共有几十个人，而且每个人都有自己特别厉害的地方。有“斗牛犬哈德森”；无畏的斯克罗金斯，他打败了“犹太人萨姆”。还有“黑人里奇蒙德”—不，他不在现场，但是我很熟悉他，就算他大腿断了，他仍然是最危险的黑人。那是珀赛尔，每次都是在快要完蛋的时候才反击成功赢得比赛。那是—什么？只允许我说最后一个了？好吧，那就这样。我认为你是这个强大家族中的最新一员，你还有很长的路要走，骨子里是真正的英国人—贝德福德的汤姆！向你致敬，贝德福德的汤姆！或是不管你想被叫什么名字都行—“春天”或“冬天”都可以！向你致敬，棕色眼睛、身高六英尺的英国人，有资格扛着六英尺的弓去往佛洛顿[39]，在那里，英格兰人打败了苏格兰国王，打败了他的亲信和骑兵。向你致敬，英国拳击手的新星，你已经取得了数不清的胜利—真正英国式的胜利，黄金也买不到的胜利。

这是发自他内心的话语。从古代流传下来的战斗基因已经在我们血液里消失多时了！好像到了和平时代，我们终于有理由将它从我们本性中根除。但在这个武装到牙齿的世界，它是我们未来最后也是唯一的保障。如果这种刚毅的品质从我们灵魂里消失了，那无论是我们的人口、财富，还是环卫我们的大海，都不能保证平安。也许这听起来很野蛮，但是在这个狂野的世界里，野蛮才能获得生机，柔弱没有机会生存。

博罗对文学和作家的看法有点古怪。对于出版商和兄弟作家，他完全只有仇恨。在他的书里，我记不起一句称赞在世作家的话，对不久前刚故去的那一辈作家也没有任何赞誉。确实，他曾经对骚塞发表过好评，但是顶多也只算是一种夸大的热情。但对于与他生活在同一时期的其他人，比如狄更斯、萨克雷和丁尼生，博罗都直接无视了，要知道他们那时正在创作的巅峰时期呢。他的眼光投向了不太有名的戴恩和其他被遗忘的威尔士人。究其原因，我觉得是因为他早年遭受的失败和很久之后才得到的认可深深伤了他的心。他觉得自己是部落领袖，但是部落里的人并不这么认为，所以他觉得不屑，傲慢地退出了。看看他骄傲而敏感的脸吧，那是解读他人生的钥匙。

我们重新回到拳击的话题吧，这让我想起了与此有关的一桩趣事。我一个朋友曾经给一位重病卧床的著名澳大利亚拳击手读一本拳击小说《罗德尼·斯通》[40]，这位将死的勇士以极大的兴趣听着，但是也对小说里搏斗的场景提出了一些犀利而专业的批评。朗读那本书的人读到了年轻的业余拳手与“残暴的伯克斯”对决的部分。伯克斯有点喘不上气，但是仍然以他强硬的左臂挡住了对手的进攻。故事里业余拳手的指导教练是一位老职业拳击手，这时喊着指点了他，教他如何应对这种情况。“对，就这样—他打到了他！”床上的病人这么喊了起来。有了这样一段，谁还在乎评论家说什么呢？

你可以看出，我自己对拳击也非常热爱，在博罗的书旁边就有三本棕色的书为证，它们的位置也非常恰当。它们是三卷本《拳击术》，我的好友罗伯特·巴尔多年前将它们送给了我。它们简直就是一座宝矿，你只要看半个小时，就能挖到宝藏。但是啊，那时候书里的行话真是太多了！全是些无趣而愚蠢的华丽辞藻，像是在对你抛媚眼，甩动手帕勾引你，还讲些乏味的笑话，并且每个句子里都有一两个斜体字，简直能把人逼疯。书中有这些可怕的行话，就算这些是由阿尔布埃拉战役和滑铁卢之战的战士进行的激烈严峻的对决，也会变得无趣又庸俗。你得去看看黑兹利特[41]写的加斯曼和“布里斯托公牛”之间的较量，才能完全感受到野性的力量。当那一记可怕的右手拳把巨人打倒在地，把他打得从眉毛到下巴都沾满了鲜血，哪怕这样的场景出现在纸上，如果读到的人没有紧张得皱起眉头，那他可真是够麻木的。但是就算没有黑兹利特对这场搏斗的描述，那些谦卑的英雄曾如此鲜活地生活在尘世间，而且有那么多英勇的事迹，如果谁不能因此受到激励，那他的想象力也太贫乏了。可如今，英雄们却只活在这鲜有人读的书里了。他们都曾是活生生的人物，性格坚定，意志坚强，达到了人类勇气与承受力的极限。封面人物是杰克逊，棕色封面上烫金的人像，他是“绅士杰克逊”，有柱子一般的小腿，高贵的头颅，他能用小指勾着八十八磅的重物写自己的名字。

下面的文字来自一个跟杰克逊很熟悉的人。

我现在还记得他的模样，就像我在一八八四年看到他时那样。当时，他正从霍尔伯恩山往下走，去往史密斯菲尔德。他穿着一件红色外套，纽扣眼儿是金线缝制的，衣服饰边儿和褶儿都是上好的蕾丝，里面是一小条白色硬领圈，没有衣领（那时他们还没发明这个东西），戴着一顶圆帽子，上面有一条很宽的黑色饰带，身着有丝绸长裤带的米色及膝短裤，下面是白色条纹丝质长袜，脚上穿着带有镶钻搭扣的低跟鞋。外套里面是淡蓝色绸缎马夹，上面点缀着白色小花。看到他壮硕的胸膛、高贵的双肩、他的腰部（如果说有什么不足，那就是太细了）、他的髋部壮实得恰到好处、小腿结实得像柱子，踝关节线条优美却并不纤弱，双脚落地有力，手又是那么纤巧，这不禁让人觉得他出现在人间，是大自然给人类树立的典范。他继续走了有五英里，差不多有半个小时，一路上收获了男人们的嫉妒和女人们的爱慕。

瞧，这段充满细节的人物描写可以让你更清楚地了解作者的最初意图。读完之后，我们不难理解为什么在那些回顾拳击运动往昔时光的文章里，在所有叫汤姆、比尔和杰克的人中间，总是有约翰·杰克逊先生。对于拜伦和伦敦许多血气方刚的青年来说，他是朋友，也是导师。正是这位杰克逊，在赛事正酣之际，抓住了“犹太人门多萨”的头发，由此，以后的拳击手都成了短发一族。在书里你能看到老布劳顿的方脸，这位十八世纪的顶级拳击手，他最初的梦想只是在普鲁士卫队里，从基准兵做起，努力往上晋升。他有一个记录者—好心的戈弗雷船长，他写下了一些后世难以超越的文字。让我们来看看下面这段话：

他像军人一样利落地停下动作，然后在界内准确地做出击打动作；他往后退的时候，并不是因为对自己没有信心而停止进攻，这种情况下，拳手通常会瞎抓一气，手臂得不到身体的支撑，挥出的拳连苍蝇都拍不死。不！布劳顿可不是，他勇敢地稳步向前，准备好迎接对手的冲击，用防守的手臂接了一拳，接着全力调动起他鼓胀的肌肉，以他强壮的身体做后盾，挥动手臂，把全身力量都聚集在了拳头上，接着将那像打桩一样的力量宣泄到对手身上。

要是英勇的船长能再多写点就好了。可怜的布劳顿，他出拳出得太频繁了。“什么，该死的，你居然被打败了！”王室公爵喊道。“我不是被打败的，殿下，我看不见我的对手了！”被打得失明的老英雄叫道。唉，这就是发生在拳击场上的悲剧，也是生活的悲剧。年轻人如迅速涨起的海浪，而之前上来的老一代浪潮就被抹平，呜咽着渗进了海滩的沙石间。“让年轻人享受大好时光吧。”高贵的老拳手说道。但是看着年老的冠军就这么倒下，多么令人悲伤！汤姆·斯普林—博罗叫他“贝德福德的汤姆”—就很睿智，他选择了急流勇退，退役时保持了不败纪录。克里布也是保持了冠军之身。但是布劳顿、斯莱克、贝尔彻等其他人，他们的结局都是一场悲剧。

拳击手的下半生通常都有点奇怪，让人捉摸不透，虽然通常来说他们寿命都不长，因为他们平日生活放荡不羁，训练时期又奉行禁欲主义，这两种交替的状态极大地损害了他们的健康。他们深受男人和女人的爱戴，这也正是他们毁灭的原因，不过拳击场上的国王最终在更致命的病症—体重减轻、感染结核菌，或者其他同样致死但鲜为人知的病菌—到来之前就已经倒下了。观众席上最年老体弱的人，也比他敬仰膜拜的了不起的年轻拳手活得要更久。杰姆·贝尔彻三十岁就过世了，胡珀三十一岁，“斗鸡”皮尔斯三十二岁，特纳三十五岁，哈德森三十八岁，“无可匹敌的兰德尔”三十四岁。偶尔，他们中也有人也能安然终老，但他们的生活也会发生最奇怪的转变。比如很多人知道的格利，最后成了一个有钱人，并且在议会改革时期担任了庞蒂弗拉克特的议员。汉弗莱斯成了一个成功的煤炭商人。杰克·马丁变成了一个坚定不移的禁酒者和素食者。“黑钻石”杰姆·沃德成了艺术家，奋发有为。克里布、斯普林、兰根，以及很多其他的人都成了成功的酒店老板。最离奇的当属布劳顿，他老了之后到处去买老画和小古董。有人看到过他，记录下了对这位沉默的老绅士的印象，他衣着过时，手里拿着自己的清单—布劳顿，曾经是英格兰令人生畏的人，现在看起来只是一位无害而温和的收藏家。

许多拳击手都是横死，但那也是意料之中，有些是死于意外事故，有的死于自己人之手。不过一流的拳击手从来不会死在拳击场上。类似的这种悲剧是发生在西蒙·伯恩身上罕见而令人悲伤的故事。他是个勇敢的爱尔兰人，很不幸地造成了对手安格斯·麦凯伊的死亡，后来自己却又死在了“聋子伯克”的手下。然而，伯恩和麦凯伊都不能算是一流拳击手。如果我们从拳击场的角度来看，人类身体确实显得越来越脆弱，而且更容易受到震荡和冲击的伤害。在这项运动的初期，比赛以死亡结束的情况极为少见。但是，渐渐地，类似的悲剧却变得普遍，到如今，就算选手都戴着拳击手套进行比赛，这类悲剧发生的频繁程度仍然令我们震惊。因此我们不免感到先辈们的这项原始的运动对于一个高度组织化的时代来说，确实是过于粗野了。不过，想想在猎场和障碍赛马场上，两三年里出现的受害者要比在拳击场上过去两个世纪里出现的还要多，这倒是可以帮我们减轻思想负担。

力量和勇气为许多拳击手带来了名气，但他们也用自己的力量和勇气报效国家。如果我没记错，克里布加入了皇家海军。还有斯克罗金斯，令人畏惧的矮个子，有壮实的胸膛和结实的肩膀，多少年来他快速猛击的打法一直所向披靡，直到狡猾的威尔士人内德·特纳终结了他的职业生涯，而内德又被另一个聪明的爱尔兰人杰克·兰德尔终结了。肖，一位享有崇高声誉的重量级拳手，在滑铁卢战役第一次冲锋时，被法国的胸甲骑兵砍成了碎片。粗野的伯克斯在巴达霍斯突围之战中英勇阵亡。这些人的生命有着一种象征意义，那就是时代对人的召唤—以毫不退缩的顽强去抵抗一个武装起来的世界。看看杰姆·贝尔彻—俊美、勇敢的杰姆，更有男子气概的拜伦—但是，这不是写古老拳击场的文章，有的人觉得有趣，另一些人可能觉得无聊。让我们跳过这三卷姿态低微、无处辩驳，但却令人沉醉的书，开始讲层次更高的话题吧！





第六章


英语中最好看的短篇小说是哪些？用这个话题开始辩论可真不错！有一点我很确定：品质一流的短篇小说要比品质一流的长篇小说少太多了。就像是雕刻一个小浮雕要比雕刻一座大雕像需要更多精湛的技巧。但奇怪的是，这两种技巧似乎是彼此独立的，甚至还是对立的。谁要是精通其中一种技巧绝不能保证这个人在另一领域也很高超。我们文学史上的大师们，比如菲尔丁、司各特、狄更斯、萨克雷、里德，都没有留下任何一篇质量上乘的短篇小说，唯一的例外可能是司各特的《雷德冈脱利特》里的《流浪汉威利的故事》。同样，另一些写短篇小说很厉害的人，比如史蒂文森、爱伦·坡和布赖特·哈特，却没有一部长篇佳作。短跑冠军很少能在五英里长跑比赛中夺得冠军。

那么，如果一定要你选，你会把哪些人放进你的队伍呢？你的选择范围其实不是很广。你会以什么标准评价他们呢？你需要看作品是否有力度，是否新颖、简洁，能否让人保持阅读兴趣，以及是否给人留下了独特、深刻的印象。爱伦·坡在这几方面都是大师。可以说正是我看到了最爱的书架上爱伦·坡那绿色封面的书，才引发了我的思绪，在我看来，坡是有史以来最具原创精神的短篇小说家。他的大脑就像是装满了种子的种荚，随处播撒，从中几乎产生了我们现在所有种类的小说。想想吧，他随意写出了那么多天才作品，从不重复自己的成功之作，而是不断获得新成就。在犯罪小说方面，他是后世庞大作家群的先祖—“绝大多数的！”虽然每个作家都可能发展出了一点自己的写作技巧，但是他主要的技巧还是要追溯到杜平探长那些精彩的故事，它们力道精湛，结构严谨，情节转折迅速。总之，头脑敏锐这一特点很适合设定在一个理想侦探身上，由于已经有人把这一点运用得如此令人敬佩，后来的作家们必然愿意沿袭相同的套路。坡不仅是侦探小说的鼻祖，其他所有寻宝、破解密码的故事都可以追溯到他的《金甲虫》，还有凡尔纳—威尔斯式伪科学小说的原型就是他的《月球旅行记》和《瓦尔德玛先生的病例》。写小说的人，如果他的故事是从坡那里起源，若是他收到稿费支票的时候都要给这位大师的纪念碑交一份“什一税”，那坡的金字塔肯定跟基奥普斯金字塔[42]差不多大了。

但是我只会在我的队伍里给坡的作品两个位置，一个给《金甲虫》，另一个给《毛格街谋杀案》。我觉得在这两个故事里，找不到瑕疵。而坡其他的故事，我认为并不算“完美”。这两个故事的格局和视角在他其他故事里都找不到，小说意象之恐怖，或说诡谲，因为叙述者和主人公的冷静而显得更加浓烈了，他们分别是杜平侦探和勒格朗。布赖特·哈特也是一个在长篇小说创作方面有所欠缺的伟大短篇小说家。他本人就像他小说里的淘金者一样，总能挖到金矿，但是挖完了接下去就没矿脉了。虽然这个金矿产量有限，但是金子质量确实最好。《咆哮营的幸运儿》和《田纳西的伙伴》这两篇都可以进入我的不朽殿堂。它们确实很有狄更斯作品的味道，甚至像是在模仿这位大师的风格，但是它们自有短篇作品的那种对称感和让人满意的整体感，就连狄更斯本人也达不到这样的水准。读这两篇故事的时候，要是喉咙里不曾哽咽的人，我可不羡慕。

那么史蒂文森呢？当然了，他的作品在我的队伍里也有两个位置，不然还有谁能让人那么真切地体验到短篇小说的精练呢？我认为他一生中创作出了两部大师之作，它们本质上都是短篇，尽管都是作为单行本出版。其中之一是《化身博士》，无论你认为它是生动的叙事小说，还是一则纯正而深刻的寓言故事，它都是质量一流的杰作。我选的另一篇是《沙汀上的孤阁》，它是戏剧性叙事文的经典模板。那篇故事在我脑海里留下了清晰的印记，那时我在《谷山杂志》上读到了它，后来又读过单行本，我立刻就看出了文本里的两处修改—都改得比原文差得多。两处修改都是极小的细节，但它们就好像是一尊完美雕塑上面出现的瑕疵。必定只有极为精妙的作品才能给人留下那么深刻的印象。当然，他也有其他十几篇小说完全能让一般作家最好的作品蒙羞，每一篇都带着史蒂文森特有的魅力，我之后再谈它们，但是只有这两篇让我觉得达到了完美境界，能加入到我选定的队伍中来。

那么还有谁呢？如果可以提名当下的作家，我一定要把鲁德亚德·吉卜林算上。他的叙事才能、凝练的文风、对戏剧感的把握，以及瞬间引燃绚丽火焰的表达方式，都足以让他被归入大师之列。但是如何从他那本收录了多篇题材各异的作品集里挑选出最合适的呢？书中很多篇都有资格获得最高地位。在我的记忆中，他最令我印象深刻的作品有《前后军团的鼓声》《国王迷》《从前的那个人》《丛林男孩》。不过，总体来说，我倾向于把前两篇加进我的杰作名单里。

它们很容易招来批评，但是也经得起批判。板球队里，伟大的击球手总是不走寻常路，敢于冒险，抓得住劣等球手把握不了的机会，蔑视了规则，而且能取得精彩的成果。它们就是这样。我想，对于年轻作家来说，以吉卜林的这些作品为模板进行创作极其危险。他的作品里有离题—短篇小说最致命的缺陷；还缺乏连贯性，结构失衡，使得故事情节在几页里处于停滞，而又只用几句话就推动了情节发展。但是他的天才战胜了一切弱点，就像伟大的板球击球手对右前方来的球会打出左旋球，并且将直球击向外场。故事里有一种冲击力和激昂的活力，用丰富而自信的技巧把情节向前推进。是的，如果不选两篇吉卜林的代表作，不朽名作的清单也不完整。

那还有谁呢？纳撒尼尔·霍桑一直都无法引起我特别高的兴趣。应该说，错在我身上，似乎我总是期待过高，而他给我的达不到这个标准。太微妙，太难以捉摸，太像给人做样子了。实际上，他儿子朱利安的一些短篇小说更能打动我，当然我完全承认老作家高超的艺术造诣和他作品风格中优雅的魅力。还有布尔沃—利顿也要求加入这个名单。他那篇《被鬼魂缠身的人与鬼魂们》是我所知的最棒的鬼故事。就冲这一点，我会把它列入我的清单。还有一个故事，叫《轮回》，我在一本旧《布莱克伍德》杂志上读到了它，也给我留下了非常深刻的印象，尽管读过很多年了，但是我还是会把它列入最佳作品的行列。另外能说是伟大杰作的还有格兰特·艾伦的一篇《约翰·科瑞蒂》。这个故事建立在一种哲学价值观之上，就此而言，它已经非常优秀了，值得被列入最佳行列。还有威尔斯和奎勒—库奇创作的一些高水准的当代作品，也达到了相当高度。在我看来，奎勒—库奇的《圈叉游戏：故事、研究和随笔》一书中那篇随笔—《老埃宋》—是同类故事中的极品。

好了，看到了坡的书，那老旧的绿色封面让我讲了这么多说教的话。如果要让我说出哪些书影响了我的人生，坡的这本短篇集的重要性仅仅排在麦考莱的《批评和历史文集》之后。我读它的时候还很年轻，思想还很容易受影响。它激发了我的想象力，在我面前树立了一个绝佳的榜样，告诉我如何讲一个优雅而有感染力的故事。当然，这也不全是有益的影响，也会让人禁不住去想那些病态而怪异的事物。

坡性情忧郁，没有幽默感，待人也不热情，热爱怪异而可怕的事物。读者必须自己拥有与之相抵消的品性，否则坡可能是个危险的同伴。我们都知道他的奇思异想把他带上了多么危险的道路，最后陷进了死亡的沼泽。十月那个阴沉的周日早上，人们在巴尔的摩街头找到了垂死的坡，他当时的年纪，本该处于力量与气概的巅峰才是。

我说过，坡是我心目中最伟大的短篇小说大师。能跟他媲美的人，我觉得只有莫泊桑了。这位伟大的诺曼人在激烈程度和原创性方面远不及那位美国人，但是他有一种与生俱来的天赋，总能找到适当的方式达到他要的效果，这让他成了文学大师。他写小说是因为他生来就有这种能力，就像苹果树上结出苹果一样，自然而完美。他的风格是多么细腻、富有表现力和艺术性啊！如此轻易而优雅地就申明了自己的观点！他的文风是多么明晰，多么刚健！完全没有英语行文中的啰唆—这种赘言风气总是让我们的文学作品大为失色。他总是直达要害。

当我写下莫泊桑的名字时，禁不住总会想起我生活中跟他有关的一次神灵干预，或称为一个惊人巧合。那时我正在瑞士各地游历，在盖米山口的一边有一座很高的悬崖，悬崖的两边分别是一个法国的州和一个德国的州。在这座悬崖的顶上，有一家小旅馆，我们在那里稍作停留。我们被告知虽然这家旅馆一年到头都有人住，但是在冬天，这里大概有三个月完全与世隔绝，因为人们只能通过一些蜿蜒的盘山小路到达这里，一旦大雪封住了这些小路，那就上也上不来，下也下不去了。那时，住在小旅馆里的人能看见下面山谷里的灯火，但却孤单得像生活在月球上一样。如此有趣的情形自然会激发人的想象力，我很快就在脑海里构思起一个短篇故事，是关于几个被困在小旅馆里的强势人物的故事，他们互相对抗、互相厌恶，却又无法摆脱彼此，每一天都离悲剧更近一步。大约有一周的时间，我一边游玩，一边在想这个故事。

最后，我经法国回家，因为没有书读，我买了从前没看过的一本莫泊桑的故事集，第一篇就叫“旅馆”，我快速浏览了第一页，看到了两个让我惊讶的词，“坎德斯泰格”和“盖米山口”。我专心往下读，却感到越来越惊讶。故事就发生在我去过的那家旅馆，讲的是一群人被大雪隔离在那里的事。我想象出的东西都在这个故事里，除此以外，莫泊桑还加进去了一只凶狠的猎犬。

当然了，这个故事的由来再清楚不过了。莫泊桑也正好去过那家旅馆，跟我一样想到了这一连串的事情。这一切都容易理解了。但是不可思议的是我在这短暂的旅途中竟然能把这本书买下来，才让我没当众出丑，不然谁会相信我要写的故事不是在模仿莫泊桑呢？我不认为假设它是巧合能掩盖事实。在我一生中，它是让我确信有神灵干预的几件事情之一，在我们自身之外的某种仁慈力量会在它力所能及之时，给予我们帮助。我相信，天主教关于守护天使的教义不仅非常美好，还有一些真实的现实依据。

或者，用最新的精神分析术语来说，是我们潜意识里的自我，用最新神学词语来说，是我们的精神，能了解我们的感官所不能领会的东西，并将其传达给大脑。但是如果转到这个话题，那又要耗费我们很长的时间了。

只要莫泊桑愿意，他也能与爱伦·坡一样写出诡异怪诞的故事，而那位美国人几乎独占了这个领域。你读过莫泊桑的一篇叫《奥尔拉》的故事吗？如果你想读魔鬼学的文章，那它肯定符合标准。当然了，这个法国人的创作范围比这要广泛得多。他富有幽默感，常常在他的故事中打破各种文学规范，但是他的故事却都别有一番滋味，读来令人愉悦。然而，归根结底，在他们两人之间，若说那位阴郁可怕的美国人更为杰出、更具独创性，谁能表示怀疑呢？

说起怪诞美国小说，你读过安布罗斯·比尔斯[43]的书吗？我这里有他的一本《在人生中间》。这个人的风格非常独特，是一位伟大的艺术家。这本书读起来并不令人快乐，但是会在你心中留下它的印记，这就是好作品的证明。

我经常在想爱伦·坡的风格究竟是从何来的。他最好的作品有一种阴郁的威严感，就像用抛光过的墨玉雕刻而成，而且这是他独有的材料。我敢说只要我取下那本书，从中任挑一个段落，都能向你说明我的观点。以下这段就是：

东方三博士的那套书里有许多美好的故事，那都是些铁封的、充满了愁思的大书。啊，书里有关于天上、地上以及海洋的光辉历史，还有曾经统治海洋、陆地与至高天堂的神灵的故事。三博士的语录里也包含着许多学识，以及多多纳神谕所周围的古树摇曳着黯淡的叶子聆听到的圣贤之言，但是，真主在上，坐在我身边的魔鬼在坟墓阴影里给我讲的那个故事，将永远最令人难忘。

或者还有这句话：

然后我们七个人，在坐着的地方被吓到了，然后颤抖着站了起来，惊惶无措，因为阴影里的那个声音并不是来自某一个人，而是许多人的，每个音调都不同，忧郁地飘进我们的耳朵，就像是成百上千个我们怀念的故友的声音。

这样的字句里难道不隐藏着一种质朴的威严吗？风格不是人发明出来的，它是某种影响的作用结果，或者说，是多种影响互相妥协的结果。可我找不出是谁影响了爱伦·坡。不过，如果黑兹利特和德昆西去写怪异故事，可能会写出类似风格的。

好了，如果你允许，我们开始谈我珍贵的《患难与忠诚》吧，就在《在人生中间》的左边。

我注意到在我之前的漫谈里，把《艾凡赫》归类为十九世纪排名第二的历史小说。我敢说肯定有许多人会把《亨利·埃斯蒙德的历史》[44]排在第一，我理解他们的看法，不过我个人不会这么做。我承认它的语言极为优美，人物塑造方面也非常连续，还有安妮女王时代的完美氛围。从来没有哪位历史小说家能对他所描写的时代有这么透彻的了解。不过，虽然这些优点都非常突出，但它们不是小说的核心。小说最重要的是要有趣，即便艾迪生曾经尖刻地说真正要紧的是糕点师不能把包装纸用光。在我看来，《埃斯蒙德》中描述的在苏格兰低地的活动，我们的马基雅维利式主人公—公爵—登场的时候，以及莫恩勋爵不详的脸出现的时候，都非常有趣，不过，故事中也有很多拖沓的部分，读起来很沉闷。一部优秀的小说作品，情节应该一直往前发展，不应出现停滞。《艾凡赫》就一刻也没有停下来，就是这一点让它比《埃斯蒙德》要优秀得多。不过，作为一部文学作品，我觉得后者更加完美。

不，如果我有三次投票机会，我还是要把这三票都投给《患难与忠诚》，因为它真的是我们最伟大的历史小说，而且也可以说，无论把它放进哪个小说类别里，它都是最伟大的作品。我想，我可以说自己读过了大多数比它更有名的那些十九世纪的外国小说，仅以我自己有限的阅读范围来讲，我觉得查尔斯·里德的《患难与忠诚》和托尔斯泰的《战争与和平》给我留下的印象要比其他书好太多了。我认为它们站在了那个世纪小说创作的最高峰。这两部作品有相似的地方—空间广阔、篇幅恢宏，人物出场与退场的方式也类似。英国作家更浪漫，俄国作家更真实、诚恳，但他们都是卓越的作家。

想想看，里德在这本书里展现了多么丰富的内容啊！他牵着读者的手，带他进入了中世纪，并不是学究气的传统中世纪，而是一个因生命力而震颤的时代，其中的人物就跟如今牛津街上挤满巴士的人们一样鲜活而真实。他带着读者去了荷兰，给他介绍那些画家，带他看纵横的水道，带他见识生活的模样。他带读者沿着长长的莱茵河—中世纪欧洲的脊髓—顺流而下。他向读者展现了印刷业的曙光、自由时代的开端、德意志南部繁华的商业城市、意大利的盛景，让读者见识到了艺术大师云集的罗马、宗教改革前夕的修道院体制。所有这一切内容都在这本书的封面和封底之间，而且穿插得那么自然，叙述得那么生动而有力。这本书之所以是一部杰作，除了它拥有恢宏的视角之外，对于杰勒德这个人物的成功刻画也是一个因素—他的本性、他的发迹和败落，以及他的重生，小说最终的悲剧性结局也动人心魄。我觉得它将知识和想象力融合在了一起，这让它在我们文学史上拥有无与伦比的价值。先读《本韦努托·切利尼自传》，再读查尔斯·里德笔下中世纪的罗马，就能明白他是如何收集到原矿，然后用自己炽烈的想象力将其熔化提炼。一个人能勤奋地去收集素材固然值得称道，但是拥有素材之后，能摸清使用法则的人，技艺则更加高超，这样的人也更为少见。能做到事实准确而不让人觉得作者在卖弄学识，行文周密但不至于读来无趣，这两点就是历史小说家追求的理想状态。

在英国文学史上，里德算得上最难以捉摸的人物之一。从来没有哪位作家像他那样难以定位。他最高水准的作品也是英国文学史上的杰作。然而他最差的作品几乎比萨里城边的低俗戏剧还要糟糕。他最好的作品里有瑕疵，最差的作品里也有可取之处；就好比他的丝绸里会掺杂着棉布，而棉布堆里也有丝绸出现。不过，虽然他有不足，他仍然是我们国家一流的小说家，他不仅写出了我刚提到的那部杰作，还创作了《亡羊补牢》《现金》《欺诈》和《格里菲斯·冈特利特》。

他的书里有一种发自内心的情感，我在别的书里都没看到过。他真心喜爱他创造的男女主人公，厌恶故事里他塑造出来的坏人，让读者也跟着他一道经历情绪起伏。对于他刻画的那些富有人情味儿、惹人喜爱的女性人物，我们只会由衷地赞美。描绘出一个充满人情味儿和优点的女子，是一种罕有的才能，尤其对于男人而言。如果十九世纪的小说中还有比茱莉亚·多德更可爱的女子，那我只能感到遗憾没能与她结识。他塑造出了这样一个优雅而美好的人物，同时写就了《患难与忠诚》中“黑店”的章节，这体现了冒险小说的最高水准，只有极少数的人拥有如此全面的才能。面对查尔斯·里德先生，我随时都准备脱帽行礼。





第七章


让我们身后的魔法之门紧闭，再好不过了。在门的外面，是俗世，以及其中的诸多烦恼、希望与恐惧、劳神与伤心、期许和失望；但是在门的里面，当你仰靠在绿色沙发上，面对一列列安静但让人感到宽慰的伙伴时，在这些逝去的伟大灵魂的陪伴下，你就会感到精神的平静和心灵的休憩。学会去热爱他们，去崇拜他们，学会去理解他们的陪伴到底有什么意义，如果你还没有这样做，你就无法感受到神灵赐予人类的最伟大的慰藉和安慰。在这扇魔法之门的里面，是让人休息的房间，在这里你能忘记过去、享受现在，并为将来做准备。

从前与我同坐在绿色沙发上的朋友，可能对书架上部的书比较熟悉：麦考莱的书封面破旧，吉本的书整洁如新，鲍斯韦尔的书是浅褐色的封面，司各特的书是橄榄绿色的封面，博罗的书是杂色的封面，还有那边并肩而立的其他好伙伴。顺便说一句，我多么希望我热爱的那些朋友能善待彼此啊。为什么博罗粗暴地对司各特吼叫呢？我本以为司各特高贵的灵魂和浪漫的奇想能迷住那位高大的流浪者，但是年轻的那位对年长的那位所使用的恶毒言辞简直令人难以置信。其实，博罗身上有一个致命的毒瘤—可以说是能摧毁你对他所有想象的毒物—那就是他在宗教方面是个相当固执的宗派主义[45]者，觉得除了自己，任何人对伟大之谜的阐述都毫无价值。直率的异教徒、嗜血的巴萨卡战士和吟诵经文的德鲁伊[46]在他的想象世界里吸引着他，但是面对跟他同一个时代、跟他信同一个教的人，如果在举行宗教仪式时细节跟他不同，或对神秘体验有些跟他不同的看法，那他就会觉得这个人邪恶到了骨子里，会毫不留情地厌恶此人。而司各特是个虔诚的老派卫道士，于是立刻成了他的眼中钉。总之，他对这些人都感到失望。在我的印象中，傲慢的博罗先生对同时代的作家一句好话都没说过。似乎他只对威尔士的吟游诗人和北欧萨迦[47]的吟唱诗人惺惺相惜，但是也有人说他这么做只是为了向世人表明他既能用威尔士语，也能用斯堪的纳维亚语进行阅读，他真是本性复杂的一个人。但是在魔法门里面，我们可不要做个不友善的人—而对不值得善意相待的人也以礼相待，就能获得美德的桂冠。

关于最上面的这一排就说这么多吧，我都唠叨了六个了，但是亲爱的读者，你可能还得接着听下去，因为如你所见，还有第二排、第三排呢，它们都是我心头最爱的书，在我的情感和记忆中都留下了同样深刻的印记。在我向你诉说这些老朋友，告诉你我为什么如此热爱它们，并且在过去的时光里它们对我有多重要的时候，请尽量耐心一些吧。假如你从那排书里选择一本，你就像是拾起了我的一缕思绪，虽然很小，但无疑是构成现在的我的密不可分的一部分。遗传驱动力、个人经历、书籍—这些是塑造一个人品格的三种力量。而它们就是塑造我的那些书籍。

你看，第二排之中有十八世纪的小说家的作品，或者说我认为重要的作品。毕竟，除去斯特恩的《项狄传》、戈德史密斯的《威克菲尔德的牧师》和伯尼小姐[48]的《埃维莉娜》之外，也只有三位有分量的作家，他们每个人也只写了三本书，但都是一流小说，所以说你只需要了解这九本书，就有底气说对英国文学的这个极为重要、极为独特的分支有了非常广泛的了解。这三位作家分别是菲尔丁[49]、理查逊[50]和斯摩莱特[51]。这九本书是：理查逊的《克拉丽莎》《帕梅拉》和《查尔斯·格兰迪森爵士》；菲尔丁的《汤姆·琼斯》《约瑟夫·安德鲁斯》和《艾米莉亚》；斯摩莱特的《皮克尔历险记》《亨佛利·克林克》和《蓝登传》。这些有真材实料的作品，来自照亮了十八世纪中期文坛的三位同时代的作家，一共就这九本书。让我们看看这九本书吧，在过去了一百五十年之后，我们是否还能辨别并阐明他们各自创作的目的，是否还能评判他们作品永恒的文学价值到底有多大。一位是伦敦城里的矮胖书商，一位是有贵族血统的浪荡才子，还有一位是粗犷的苏格兰海军军医—这就是我们要试着去比较的三个奇怪的不朽作家，他们一直是那个世纪小说创作的领军人物，我们作为他们之后的第五代人，之所以能对那个世纪的生活和人物有所了解，都多亏了他们。

当然这个话题并不能太教条化，因为对性情不同的人来说，他们三个人都有不同的魅力，而且无论读者选哪个人当冠军，一定都有自己的理由做支撑。但是，我认为不会有太多的读者把斯摩莱特跟其他两位放在同一个水平线上。从道德层面讲，他很粗俗，但却有丰富的幽默感，比起另外两个对手那种润色过多的妙语，他的文字更能给人带来欢笑。我记得在少年时代—那时，在纯真之人的眼里一切都是纯真的—我读《皮克尔历险记》的时候，一直都在哈哈大笑，直到读到“按照古人的仪式举行晚宴”那一章，它让我哭了起来。成年之后，我再次读了这本书，效果还是那样，不过更能理解其中的淫欲行为。他的小说虽然具有极大的优点—语言非常质朴，但是却让他无法跟理查逊和菲尔丁抗衡。他对生活的看法局限性很大，他的人物塑造得平淡无奇，故事情节也并不出色，思想也没那么深刻。所以在这三个人中我肯定会把第三名给他。

那么怎么排菲尔丁和理查逊的名次呢？这真是两个巨人之间的竞争，让我们来逐一比较他们的特点，然后再下结论吧。

有一种天资极为少见，极为微妙，他们两人都具有，而且他们两人在这一点上都很优秀。那就是他们都写出了最让人喜欢的女性人物，我觉得在我们所有的文学作品中，她们是最完美的女性。如果十八世纪的女性都是她们那样的，那十八世纪的男性真是运气太好了。她们自尊自爱、优雅智慧，而且那么标致、可爱、娇美，通情达理，又极富魅力。就算是在现在这个时代，她们都是我们心中的理想女性。认识她们之后，我们不免有种矛盾的心理，一方面是对她们产生的恭敬的爱慕之情，另一方面是对她们身边那群猪猡的憎恶。帕梅拉、哈丽特·拜伦、克拉丽莎、艾米莉亚和索菲亚·韦斯顿都是非常可爱的女性，而且她们身上所展现的并不是那种消极的美，不是十九世纪那些看似天真实则无趣、只懂取悦别人的玩偶女性的那种美，她们的美是一种本性之美，源于警醒的头脑、明确坚定的原则性、真实的女性情感，以及完美的女性魅力。从这个角度来说，两位作家可以说是打了个平手，面对这两组完美的人物，我也无法做出选择。矮胖的印刷商和堕落的花花公子思想里都有一个完美的女性。

但是他们笔下的男性啊！唉，真是品质急转直下！如果有人说我们每个人都可能做出汤姆·琼斯做的事情—我真的听过有人这么讲—这种说辞绝对是是非颠倒的伪善之言，它让我们认为我们内心真实的样子可能比我们表现出的样子要坏得多。要是有人觉得一个男人真爱一个女人的时候，通常就无法对她真诚，这个说法绝对是对人性的污蔑，而且，更重要的是，他不忠的行为是那么恶劣，甚至都引起了好人汤姆·纽康姆的愤怒。汤姆·琼斯连碰触索菲亚裙边的资格都没有，就像布斯上尉根本不配成为艾米莉亚的丈夫。我想可能除了奥尔华绥乡绅，菲尔丁笔下没有写过其他绅士。他最多能写出一个好色、爱斗、心善而物欲的男人。他那些相貌堂堂的男主人公里面，哪有一个有灵魂、性情高贵的？从这一点来说，我觉得作为平民的印刷商做得要比贵族先生好得多。查尔斯·格兰迪森爵士[52]是一个高贵的人，虽然他的创造者因为太迁就他而有点损害他的形象，但仍不失为一位心灵高尚、无可挑剔的绅士。如果是他与索菲亚或是艾米莉亚结婚，我不会表示异议。就算是执拗的B先生[53]，以及多情浪子洛夫莱斯[54]，虽然他们行为都有出格的地方，但是本性都很善良，也都可能成为高尚而温柔的人。所以，我毫不怀疑理查逊在描写男性方面更胜一筹，而且在格兰迪森这个人物身上，他达到了自己很少或从来没有达到的境界。

在我看来，理查逊的写作也比菲尔丁更为细腻和深沉。他比较在意对人物进行持续而细腻的描写，也对人类心灵进行了透彻的分析，而且他做起这些都是举重若轻，用的都是很平实的语言，当你回想的时候，才会发现其中的深刻性和真实感。他从来没有堕落成菲尔丁那样，书中满是闹剧似的扭打和推搡，虽然生动，但也拉低了作品的格调。我们也可以说菲尔丁的生活视野更为开阔。他既认识上层社会的人，也熟悉底层人民的生活。而他的对手，那位文雅的平民，从没有机会，也没有意愿去探索那些人的生活。菲尔丁描绘的伦敦底层生活的画卷，比如《艾米莉亚》中监狱的场景，《伟大的乔纳森·怀尔德传记》中的盗贼集团，以及他笔下的负债人拘留所和贫民窟，都是那么生动而全面，就像是他朋友霍格斯的画一样。霍格斯可算得上是最有英国气质的画家，正如菲尔丁是最有英国气质的作家一样。但是关于生命最伟大、最永恒之处，总是在最小的圈子里找到的。一个男人和两个女人这样的小圈子，就可以让悲剧或喜剧演员演绎出最令人满意的主题。所以说，虽然理查逊的写作有很大的局限性，但是他对如何达到他的目的有着清晰透彻的认识。帕梅拉，一个出身平凡的完美女性；克拉丽莎，一个完美的上层社会淑女；格兰迪森，一位无瑕的绅士。他在这三个人物身上倾注了极大的创作激情。如今，一百五十年过去了，我觉得我们在别处仍然找不到能超越他的人。

我们也要承认，他是很啰唆，不过谁忍心去打断他呢？他就是愿意坐下来，把一切都讲给你听。他使用了信件的方式讲故事，这使闲聊式的行文读起来容易些了。首先，他的男主人公写了一封信，说出哪些事情已经发生了。你可以读到他的信。同时，他的女主人公也在给她的朋友写信，也在信中陈述了自己的观点。这你也能看到。他们的朋友也分别回了信，所以你也能知道他们的朋友的观点和意见。说真的，在读完之前，其实你就已经什么都知道了。起初这么读下来可能有点乏味，特别是你早已习惯了在每个章节都能看到那种焰火爆发般喧嚣的文风。但是，渐渐地，它会制造出一种身临其境的感觉，让你去了解这些人物的性格和他们面临的困境，其他任何造梦小说都做不到这一点。《帕梅拉》确实比一般的书要厚三倍，不过为什么不给它些时间呢？有什么可着急的。读一本大师之作可要比读三本不会给你留下永久印象的平庸之作好多了。

它与那个世纪沉静的生活是多么契合，从此以后就再也没有这么安静的日子了。在孤寂的乡间大宅里，鲜有书信和报纸可读，你觉得那时的读者会抱怨书写得太长吗？幸福的帕梅拉和不幸的克拉丽莎的故事，他们听再多也不会厌烦。只有在极为特别的情况下，如今的我们才可能领会到那个时代的人正常接受事物的思维方式。麦考莱记录下了那种极为特别的情况。当时他在印度山区的一个避暑之地，书非常少，他借出了一本《克拉丽莎》。结果不出所料。只要环境适宜，理查逊的书就像一阵低烧一样把那个地方的人都传染了。他们生活中有他，做梦也梦到他，直到这一有趣的事件融入文学的历史，对于经历过的人来说终生难忘。每一个人都能听得懂它的旋律。它的文字是那么准确，又那么质朴：对学者来说，没有哪一页不值得拍手称道；对女仆来说，没有哪一页她看不懂。

当然了，这个故事由书信组成，有许多明显的劣势。司各特在《盖伊·曼纳林》一书中重新使用了这一手法，还有其他耳熟能详的成功例子，但往往要求读者能够耐心，并且全盘接受，这样才能读出生动的感觉。我们难免会觉得那些连续不断的细节、冗长的对话是不可能以这种方式被记录下来的。愤愤不平、衣衫凌乱的女主人公怎么可能坐下来冷静并细致地描写她逃脱的过程呢？理查逊的描述非常精彩，但本质上有缺陷。菲尔丁使用了第三人称手法，挣脱了束缚他竞争对手的那些枷锁，使小说有了自由发挥的空间，也有了一种个人叙事的权威性，这对小说发展来说是前所未有的。在这一点上，他是真正的大师。

即便如此，总的来说，我还是更倾向于投票给理查逊，我敢说在一百人中，只有我一个人这么想。首先，除了我已经说过的，他拥有小说第一人的顶级荣誉。就算模仿者精进了技艺、拓展了疆域，原创者仍然应该获得更高的地位。理查逊才是“英国小说之父”，而菲尔丁不是。他第一次发现，原来不用浪漫英雄主义，不用奇异的想象，而用平实的语言，取材于日常生活，也可以讲出动人的故事。这就是他开启的伟大篇章。所以从这个角度，菲尔丁完全就是在模仿他，或者说戏仿[55]他，手段简直是无比大胆（也有人会说他厚颜无耻）。可怜的理查逊，《帕梅拉》书中的人物直接被菲尔丁用在了处女作《约瑟夫·安德鲁斯》中，而且菲尔丁目的不纯，完全是为了嘲讽这些人物。从文学道德观的角度来说，这就像是萨克雷写了一本小说，引入了《匹克威克外传》里的匹克威克和仆人山姆，目的只是为了证明这两个人物站不住脚。所以不出意料，就连那位平时性格温和的小书商也生气了，私底下说他的敌人是个寡廉鲜耻的家伙。

于是我们要谈一谈备受争论的道德问题。当然了，说到这个，在某个阶层的批评家之中，也存在着非常多的说教之言，完全在颠倒是非。有些推断表面上在说不道德与艺术两者间存在着微妙的联系，似乎讨论或者描述情色主题是真正艺术家的标志。其实它并不难讨论或描写。相反，情色主题很容易处理，它有非常多的戏剧化表现形式，因此永远都在诱惑作家去使用它们。论到制造以假乱真的戏剧效果，这个方法最简单，也最廉价。难的不是去做，而是去抵制。但是抵制的理由往往是因为作家必须时刻保持绅士做派，或者说作家写的东西如果在女士耳边说出来时，他会当场被人以正当理由撂倒，那就不应该让女士的眼睛看到。但是，“你必须描写世界原本的样子”。为什么要这样做？当然了，艺术家最终呈现的东西都经过了选择和限制。的确，在比现在更狂野的年代里，伟大的作家根本不会在意什么限制，但那时生活本身的限制也很少。而我们身在我们自己的年代，必须按照它的规则办事。

然而，生活的这些方面就应该完全被排除在外吗？绝对不是。我们行为得体，并不代表要假正经。关键在于作者以什么样的态度去写它。如果要讲作者写这个的各种态度，你肯定找不到比理查逊、菲尔丁和斯摩莱特这三位强劲的对手更适合作例子的了。有的作家以谴责为目的，直率地描写堕落。这种作家是道德家，最好的例子就是理查逊。有的作家可能既不带同情，也不带谴责，只是将摆在那里的事实描写出来，这种作家是现实主义者，菲尔丁就是这样。还有的作家描写堕落可能只是为了从中提炼出乐趣，这种是粗鄙的幽默作家，斯摩莱特就属于这种类别。最后，还有一种作家描写堕落是为了表达同情，这种人坏透了，在复辟时期[56]，作家圈里这样的人非常多。然而，如果问为什么要探讨这个方面的生活主题，在能给出的所有理由当中，理查逊的笔法最佳，别人都没他这样有技巧。

撇开写作不谈，菲尔丁身上有着非常高贵的品格。他比他笔下那些男主人公要好得多。只有他接受了净化伦敦的任务，那时候伦敦可是欧洲最危险、最无法纪的首都。从霍格斯的画里可以瞥见菲尔丁上任前伦敦的样子：到处是底层的无赖、上流社会的恶霸、醉醺醺的酒鬼、恶棍，还有在河边总有一扇活板门的贼窝，他们可以通过活板门把尸体扔进河里。这就是当时等待被清理的“奥吉斯国王的牛圈”[57]，然而我们的这位赫拉克勒斯[58]却体弱多病，比起接受这个任务，他更应该去医院疗养。这项工作让他付出了生命的代价，年仅四十七岁就过世了，他为工作耗尽了自己的精力。不过他也有可能以更戏剧化的方式丧命，因为他已经成为犯罪分子计划攻击的目标人物，而且根据某些被收买的流氓的告发，在得到新贼窝暴露的信息时，他都是亲自带队搜查。但是他达到了自己的目的。大约用了一年多的时间，他完成了这项任务，伦敦从欧洲最混乱的首都变成了最守法的一个，而且此后一直保持这种状态。从没有谁能留下这么精美的纪念碑。

如果你想了解那个真实的菲尔丁，那不应该去他的小说里面找，在他的小说里，他真诚的善意总是掩藏在伪装的玩世不恭之下；想了解真实的菲尔丁，你应该去读他的《里斯本航海日记》。他知道自己的健康状况已经不可挽回，所剩日子不多了。在这种时候，我们就可以看到一个人真实的样子，在大限即将到来之际，他不再需要去矫饰或是伪装。在死亡阴影下的菲尔丁表现出了一种安静而温和的勇气，思想上也保持着一致性，让我们看到了他杰出的人格如何被他早期的意志薄弱所掩盖。

关于十八世纪的小说，我已经说了很多了，但是在结束前还想再提一本。你也看到我之前都没写这么多的内容，但是这个主题本身确实会有点让人停不下来。我会略过斯特恩，因为他那种烦琐的风格并不合我的胃口。然后我也要跳过伯尼小姐的小说，因为她写的不过是前辈大师们作品的女性对照版。但是戈德史密斯的《威克菲尔德的牧师》绝对值得说上一段。这本书跟戈德史密斯其他的书一样，读来令人愉悦。只有心灵良善的人才可能写出这样的书，只有这样的人才能写出《荒村》这样的诗歌。说来奇怪，老约翰逊以那种高人一等的姿态奚落这个畏畏缩缩的爱尔兰人[59]，而其实他们两人无论在诗歌、小说，还是戏剧创作方面，后者都证明了自己更为优秀。而且，这就是一堂写作实例课，告诉我们生活的真相可以如何被呈现，而不引起人的反感。他并没有逃避事实，一切都被忠实地记录了下来。如果我想给一位心思敏感的年轻[60]士推荐一本书，让她对未来的生活有点心理准备，但又不至于伤害她脆弱的感情，我肯定会选择《威克菲尔德的牧师》。

好了，十八世纪小说家就说到这里。他们的作品在我书橱里有专架，在我的心里也占据着一个角落。可能你很多年来从来没有想到他们，但是突然一个词、一串思绪让你重新来到了他们面前，然后看着他们，心中充满了热爱之情，觉得能认识他们真是一种荣幸。接下来，让我继续说一点能让你们更感兴趣的话题。

假如能得到全国公共图书馆的统计数据，看一看作家在读者中受欢迎的程度，我敢肯定乔治·梅瑞狄斯[61]先生肯定票数很低。但是，如果从另一个角度来看，看哪些作家在同行眼里最伟大、对他们创作影响最大，我同样确定梅瑞狄斯先生肯定会有压倒性的得票数。确实如此啊，能跟他有一拼的大概只有哈代[62]先生了吧。所以说，为什么人们对他作品的评价分歧那么大，为什么他的作品遭到普通读者的抵制，却又让那些意见很重要的人乐此不疲，这些问题倒挺有趣。

最显而易见的原因，就是他的风格完全不循常规。大众读者读书是为了娱乐，而小说家则是为了给自己的创作找寻新灵感。读梅瑞狄斯的作品可不是单纯的娱乐，而是一种智力上的锻炼，就好像是思想在做哑铃操，以此增强你的思考能力，当你读他的书时大脑会一直处于紧绷状态。

如果你愿意相信我的品味，就像猎人跟着他猎犬的鼻子走一样，你会发现上述评论在我爱读的《理查德·法弗尔的苦难》一书中得到了印证。这本书就在那边的角落里。这真是一本了不起的书，充满了智慧和妙语！这位大师其他的佳作可能更有代表性，或者更加深刻，但就我个人而言，我总是会把这本书拿出来推荐给尚未读过的人。如果要我给维多利亚时代最喜欢的小说排个名次，它会排第三，就在《名利场》和《患难与忠诚》之后。这本书大约出版于一八五九年。不可思议的是，且不管是由于来自评论家还是大众读者的偏见，竟然过了二十年才再版。

但是，任何结果的产生都是有原因的，不论原因多么牵强。是什么造成了这本书的失败呢？毫无疑问，它的文风有问题。他后来作品中的华丽辞藻和激昂的行文，在这本书里都被压抑着，表达得很乱。但是它是一种全新风格的创作，因此读者和评论家都看不下去。他们无疑觉得这种文字太装模作样了，就像是二十年前他们看待卡莱尔的态度一样，但是他们忘了，作家原创的新颖文风应该是有机的整体，像他的眼睛一样是他的一部分。用卡莱尔[63]的话说，它不是一件随你开心在任何时间都可以穿上或脱下的衬衫，而是皮肤，永远都在。那么这种怪异而强烈的风格应该如何描述呢？也许，用他自己强有力的文字最合适，这是他写卡莱尔的话，或许暗自也想表示他自己的文字也是那么有力。

“卡莱尔最喜欢的作者，”他说，“写主人公的方式要么像刚开始建造的房子，要么像完全坍毁的房子，看起来很随意，很粗糙。像一阵吹进果园的风，粗野地咆哮着四处吹掉许多果实，他写的句子没有开头，突然又结束了，像烟，像拍打防波堤的海浪；字典里文绉绉的词夹杂着街头俚语，还有突然出现的各种口音，如同从流动的云层中斜射下来的阳光；所有的书页像被一阵微风吹过一样，整本书给人的头脑和身体带来了一种电流般的刺激。”

他将文字的风格分析和描述得多么美妙啊！“所有的书页像被一阵微风吹过一样”这句话给人留下的印象是那么生动！作为对卡莱尔的评价，作为梅瑞狄斯文字的一个样本，这段话都是完美的代表。

好了，《理查德·法弗尔的苦难》终于有了自己的地位。我承认，我一直坚信读者的洞察力。我觉得好作品不会被忽视。文学，就像水一样，会找到自己真正适合的位置。评价总是要慢慢形成，但最终会反映出作品的真正水平。我敢肯定，如有评论家联合起来捧一本书或者贬低一本书，他们在五年之内会成功（他们一直都是这样），但是这对最终结果没什么决定性影响。谢里丹[64]曾经说过，如果他床上的跳蚤都意见统一的话，它们老早就把他赶下床了。我不觉得评论家的一致意见曾让哪本好书退出过文学史。

在《理查德·法弗尔的苦难》的微弱优点中挑一条来说—请原谅一个爱好者的啰唆—书里散落的格言完全可以进入我们英语谚语库之中。“当人的祷告得到应允时，他更能成为一个好人。”“谋取私利是人的智慧；行为正直则是神的智慧。”“所有伟大思想都源自内心。”这些句子藏着多少奥秘啊！还有这句话：“嘲笑人性弱点的人，才是我们当中的懦夫。”真是良言。还有一句里面透着积极乐观的态度：“对于思想来说，唯一需要的就是把握幸福；站在这个智慧的顶峰，我们就可以看到这个世界是精心设计的。”还有更有趣的：“女人绝对是最后才被男人驯化的生物。”让我们赶紧结束吧，因为从《理查德·法弗尔的苦难》一书中引用句子的人，肯定会迷失方向的。

如你所见，他还有好多其他作品呢。有意大利主题的小说，《桑德拉·贝罗尼》和《维特多利亚》；还有《罗达·弗莱明》，这本书曾经让史蒂文森大为惊艳；以及《比彻姆的事业》，这本书讲的是一些过时的政治话题。伟大作家不应该在转瞬即逝的主题上浪费自己的笔墨。这就像是给一位穿着一件过时的裙子的美人画像，她就会跟她的画一起变得陈旧。还有一本很精妙的小说—《克劳斯威的戴安娜》，里面有威勒比·帕特恩这个不朽的人物，是男性自私主义的永恒代表。还有《哈利·理查蒙德》，在我看来，它最初的章节真可列入英语作品最好的叙事文本之中。这么杰出的人完全可以写出他的时代偏爱的任何形式的作品。他只是碰巧成了小说家。在伊丽莎白女王时代，他可以是个伟大的剧作家；在安妮女王时代，他也可以成为伟大的散文家。但是，不论他选择什么媒介，他都能将他伟大的思想和灵魂彰显出来。





第八章


我们可以安心地把十八世纪的小说家们—菲尔丁、理查逊和斯摩莱特—留在身后了，在小说创作上，他们实力雄厚、大胆创新，无比诚挚但也不乏粗糙之处。如你所料，细述完他们，书架的这一排我们就看完了。怎么，还没觉得累？还想再来一些？那我们接着看下一排吧，我会跟你讲点有趣的东西，不过，要是你不是天生就爱书的人，那可要听烦了。要知道，对书的爱是众神赐予人类最珍贵的天赋。要是一个人很不幸地缺乏这种天赋，我却非要唤起他对书的爱，那无异于对着聋子弹奏乐曲，或是带着色盲在艺术学院漫步。

在书架的角落里有一本棕色封面的旧书。我不记得它是怎么给放那儿了，它是我在爱丁堡花三便士买的，当时它被放在一个处理商品的盒子里出售，它历经沧桑的弟兄们现在被放在黑黢黢的走廊那边。这本书却挤进了书架上的精英梯队。但是它也值得说上几句。拿出这本书，感受一下！看它的封面是那么黑，厚实方正，鳞片纹路的皮革封面像是能刀枪不入。然后翻开封面看扉页上的藏书票[65]，褪色的黄色墨水写着“威廉·怀特藏书，一六七二年”。我很好奇这位威廉·怀特到底是个什么样的人，在快活王[66]当政的年头，他是做什么的。他的笔迹有力而棱角分明，我猜他是一位性格果断的十七世纪律师。而这本书出版于一六四二年，那时我们的清教徒前辈正在美国的新家安定下来，而查理一世的脑袋还好端端地在肩膀上待着，不过对于周遭发生的事情肯定相当迷惑。这本书以拉丁文写成—也许西塞罗[67]不太乐意承认这一点—它写的是战争法规。

我想象着一个像戴尔吉铁[68]那样的老学究把这本书夹在水牛皮外套下，或是别在枪套下，随时准备拿出来应对突发事件。“好呀！这里有一口井，”他说，“我是不是可以给里面下点毒呢？”于是他拿出了这本书，用脏兮兮的食指沿着目录往下找。书上说“因为这是属于敌方的水源”，等等。“啧啧，这事不能干。但是这里有些敌人正在谷仓里面待着，这事怎么办？”书上说“敌人可用火攻”，等等。“好啊，他说我们可以这么做。赶紧，安布罗斯，快拿稻草和打火匣来。”在那个年代，蒂利伯爵[69]洗劫了马格德堡，克伦威尔[70]提糖浆桶的手拿起了剑，战争可不是儿戏。如果放在现今，长期作战的情况可能并不比那时候更乐观，因为人们身在其中饱受磨难，心中充满怨恨。这本书里的许多战争法则至今仍然有效，然而纪律严明的英国军队残酷地占领了巴达霍斯和罗德里戈城，这事发生了才不到一百年。最近在欧洲爆发的战争都持续得不长，还不足以将纪律和人性撕成碎片，但是一旦有持久战发生，就会再次证明人类并没有改变，文明不过是极为脆弱的伪饰。

你看到那一整排书了吗？就是一气排满了整排书架的那些。我对它们非常骄傲，那些藏书是关于拿破仑战争回忆录的。有一个故事讲的是一个不识字的百万富翁，委托一位书商找关于拿破仑的书，只要涉及拿破仑军事生涯的某一个方面，任何语言都可以。富翁觉得这方面的书应该能装满他图书馆的一个书橱了。几周之后，他收到了书商的信，大吃一惊，因为书商说已经找到了四万册书，正在等待指示，看是先给他送来，还是等全部的书齐了再一起送。这个数字可能不确切，但至少说明了你要找全这个主题的书是不可能的，要把它们读完可能要耗费数年的时间，你会迷失在巨大的迷宫之中，而且最后可能并不能真正获得什么。但是我们也许可以选取一角，就像我选择了军事回忆录的主题一样，这样才有可能读到一些定论。

在这列书最边上是马尔博男爵的回忆录，所有士兵文学的鼻祖。这是法语版的三卷本全集，封面是红色与金色的，看起来漂亮又文雅，跟它的作者气质相近。书的标题页有他的画像，俊美的圆脸上满是少年之气，那时正是他所热爱的骑兵队的队长。在另一本书里是他当上将军之后的画像，头发灰白，表情像一只老斗牛犬，但是仍然像是随时准备战斗的样子。当我知道有人怀疑马尔博回忆录的真实性的时候，真是备受打击。荷马都可能被说成是一群衣不蔽体的吟游诗人的代表。甚至连莎士比亚的荣誉之冠都可能被撼动，因为有看似可信的证据说他的作品出自培根之手。但马尔博可不是！他多么富有人性、多么英勇、多么无人能及啊！他的书是迄今为止对拿破仑麾下士兵最为完整的记录，对我而言，那些士兵甚至比他们伟大的领袖更有吸引力，尽管这位领袖是历史上独一无二的人。看看那些士兵，他们头戴高筒军帽，身背毛制的背包，意志坚定如铁—多么高尚的人啊！而且，法国究竟潜藏了多么巨大的能量啊！在未来的二十三年里，他们还将继续一刻不停地抛洒儿子们的鲜血！

花了那么久才平息法国大革命在人们血管里播下的狂热。而且那时他们都还没有疲倦，因为法国士兵打的最后一战也是他们最精彩的一战。我们英国人当然为滑铁卢之战中英勇的英国步兵骄傲，但是在这史诗般的一篇中，法国的骑兵们才应该得到最光辉的冠冕。他们打败了我们的骑兵，一次次夺走了我们的枪炮，将我们的大部分友军从战场上清扫一光，然后他们继续昂扬前行，依然充满斗志。

那边是里德·格罗诺的《回忆录》，这本闲聊式的黄色封面的小书能将那个时代的一切生动地带到我们眼前，比任何其他装模作样的书可好多了，在这本书中你也能看到英国军官如何向当时法国的马上战士表达他们衷心的敬意。

回顾历史，我们必须承认，英国人不是好盟友，在战场上也不是忠实的好伙伴。主要原因是我们的政治问题，一个党派总是特别喜欢把另一党派缔结的友好关系打破。条约的缔结者一直都很强硬，皮特和卡斯雷尔任期内的托利党如此，安妮女王时期的辉格党也是一样，但是迟早都有别的伙伴要加入进来。在马尔伯勒战役的尾声，由于国内的政治变化，我们突然跟敌人达成了和约，对盟友弃之不顾。我们也这么对待过腓特烈大帝[71]，如果拿破仑时期当政的是福克斯，我们可能也会这么对待普鲁士。对我们战场上的盟友来说，我们衷心说出的话根本不值一提，只有滑铁卢战役的普鲁士人才是真正的强大。你得去读法国人何塞写的书，才能对他们扮演的角色有一个大致了解。想想布吕歇尔[72]，七十岁的老人，前一天刚被一队冲锋的骑兵击败，但还是嚷嚷说就算需要被绑在自己的马上出战，他也会去帮威灵顿将军[73]。他无私地践行了自己的诺言。

普鲁士人在滑铁卢战役中的损失绝不比我们少。如果你读的是英国历史学家写的东西，你是不可能知道这一点的。而且对我们的盟友比利时的批判有点太过了。他们中的许多人也打了精彩的战役，他们步兵的一个旅在战役的关键时刻也起了重要作用。在英国的书里你也不会读到这个。再看看我们的葡萄牙盟友吧，他们都是受过良好训练的精兵强将，威灵顿将军是那么希望有一万名这样的士兵跟随他一起参加滑铁卢战役。第一个登上巴达霍斯堡垒制高点的就是一个葡萄牙人，他们从未得到应得的承认。西班牙人也是，虽然他们总是吃败仗，但是正是他们不可战胜的顽强在战斗中起到了至关重要的作用。是的，我认为我们不是太友善的伙伴，但是我想纵观所有国家的历史，都可以被人做类似的指控。

不得不承认，马尔博写的细节有时候不太可信。就算是查尔斯·利弗[74]的小说里也没那么多千钧一发的脱险故事和玩儿命的英勇行为。无疑，他有时候是夸张了一点。你或许还记得他在埃劳的历险—我记得好像是埃劳吧—一颗炮弹从他头盔顶上擦过，让他脊椎受到了震荡，当时就瘫倒了；还有一次，一个俄国军官冲过来要干掉他，他的马差点把那个人的脸咬掉了。在马尔博买下这匹马之前，它就是个什么都撕咬的破坏狂，马尔博没花什么钱就把它买了，当它准备咬他的时候，马尔博把煮熟的羊腿塞进了它的嘴里，因此治好了它。要度过这些劫难确实需要强大的信念。可是，当我们回顾拿破仑麾下的军官们经历过的上百次大小战役—这些征战在他们一生中从未中断，从唇边长出第一根黑色的胡须，到头顶冒出第一根银丝—我们也确实难以判断在这无与伦比的军旅生涯中，到底发生过什么。无论如何，不管他写的是小说，还是记录了事实—我觉得他记录的是事实，只不过是以艺术手法突出了一些亮点—在我的书架上，要说有什么不可或缺的书，勇敢的马尔博的回忆录就是其中之一。

我一直在谈这本书是因为它真的是一流作品；但是从整个这种类型的创作来看，所有的作品都是那么有趣。马尔博的书是以军官的视角写就的。德塞格福尔、德费藏萨克和冈维尔上校都是这么写的，只是从不同兵种的视角入手。但是也有当兵的人写的书，这些要比其他书生动、形象得多。比如说，这里有老好人科尼埃德信件，他是近卫步兵第一团的士兵，到大战结束之后才学会读书写字。他可算得上有史以来从未投入过战斗的、最顽强的战士。还有勃艮第中士的书，他的书记录了在俄国发生的那场噩梦般的战役。还有勇士谢威利特，他是轻骑兵团的号兵，他实事求是地记录了亲眼所见的一切，每天“战斗”中穿插着日常真正的任务，那就是要搜寻聊以果腹的早饭和晚饭。这些历经沙场的人留下的记录，真是精彩无比，读起来也很轻松。

作为一个英国人，认识到这些人的真实模样之后，不免会问自己，如果当初有十五万科尼埃德和勃艮第那样的士兵，由马尔博那样的军官带领，在有史以来正处于精力巅峰的最强大的首领指挥下，如果他们在肯特[75]登陆了会怎样？有好几个月的时间，那里的形势都很危险，一触即发。如果海军方面有疏忽，让英吉利海峡出了纰漏，就会有布洛涅[76]港出发的船穿过来，他们不断训练，时间卡得非常准，简直令人难以置信，从第一匹马到最后一匹，全部登船只用了两个小时。佩文西[77]海岸在任何晚上都可能迎来这样一整队人马。然后会发生什么呢？我们知道亨伯特将军在爱尔兰带着一小队人做了什么事，情况看起来并不乐观。当然了，征服英格兰是不可想象的。正在交战的世界不可能做到。但是拿破仑从来也没想过要征服不列颠。他明确表达过并不想征服那里。他倒是认真地想过洗劫英国，给它带来重创，让英国在数年之中都忙于重建，从而无暇顾及海外，不会阻碍他的欧洲大计。

朴次茅斯、普利茅斯和希尔内斯都将被火焰吞噬，伦敦要么被夷为平地，要么被他勒索，由他随意开价—这个计划到更具可行性。接下来，以被征服的欧洲组成的联合舰队为靠山，仗着惊人的兵力和取之不尽的财力，以及不列颠的天价赎金，他就可以着手征服美洲，夺回法国曾经丢掉的殖民地，成为全世界的主人。最坏的情况是他在南唐斯遭遇了滑铁卢，不过他也有退路，就像在埃及和后来在俄国的情况一样：他可以乘一艘快船回到法国，这样他仍然有足够的兵力控制欧洲大陆。当然了，他也冒了很大的风险，要拿他的十五万精锐部队当赌注，不过就算他输了，也可以东山再起；然而，要是他赢了，那他就是牌局的赢家了。这局设得很不错—但是偏偏纳尔逊将军[78]阻止了他的计划，这一击决定了拿破仑在海上的势力范围。

在那个柜子上有一枚纪念章，它能给你直观的感受。拿破仑准备在抵达伦敦的时候发行纪念章，柜子上的那枚就是依据原版纪念章的模子做成。它的存在证明了他的大军集结计划并不是在唬人，他非常认真地准备这么干。纪念章一面是他的头像，在另一面，是一个法国的男子正在与一个长着鱼尾巴的怪物搏斗，即将把它摔倒在地上，这个怪物就是背信弃义的阿尔比恩[79]。一处刻着“进军伦敦”，另一处刻着“君临英格兰”。这枚徽章本来是想用来纪念胜利的时刻，现在却成了一次惨败的纪念品。但是当时情况真是很险。

顺便问一下，说起拿破仑逃离埃及的事情，你见过一本小书吗？如果我没记错，它的书名是《拦截信件合集》。不过，我书架上没有这本书，但我一个朋友比较幸运拥有它。这本书显示出在十八世纪末期，两个国家之间存在着令人难以置信的仇恨，甚至堕落到了对个人进行骚扰的地步，简直卑劣至极。这一回，英国政府拦截了驻埃及的法国军官寄出的一包信件，收件人是他们在法国的朋友，然后英国把这些信件出版了，或者至少允许了它们的出版，这无疑是希望引起家庭纠纷。历史上还有比这更卑鄙无耻的报复行径吗？我曾亲眼看到过德维特将军洗劫过的地方有一个被烧得残缺不全的英国人的邮包。但设想一下，如果他的报复心都到了非要把信出版出来的程度，那可真是恨到希望对方五雷轰顶的地步！

至于那些法国军官，我读了他们的信，即使已经过了一个世纪，我仍然有一种负罪感。不过，总的来说，那些信给写信的人增了光，让人觉得那些人高贵而充满骑士风度。至于信封上的地址是不是寄给对的人，那就是另一回事了，因此这件最没有英国风度的事件留下了一根毒刺。而法国方面也做出过非常野蛮的行径，还记得一八〇三年战争重新开始时，英国游客和商人在法国被捕的事情吧。他们心怀信任和信心前往法国，为的是去度个假，换个环境散散心。他们可真够受的，拿破仑的铁拳紧紧箍住了他们，直到一八一四年，他们才与家人团聚。拿破仑还真是心如磐石，意志顽强如铁。看看他对被俘的海军士兵做的事吧。正常的程序是交换战俘。但是由于某种原因，他觉得这个政策并不正确。英国政府提出的所有条件都被搁置在一旁，只有少数针对高级军官的方案得以实施。于是在英格兰就有了囚船地狱和骇人听闻的俘虏营。因此也有了不幸的法国凡尔登滞留人员。然而，对于给他们带来巨大不幸的始作俑者，那些平凡的法国士兵从来也没有表达过任何怨恨之情，他们的忠诚令人敬佩。博罗在《拉文格罗》中对当时的情景有着生动的记录。下面就是书里的一段：

这些庞大的战俘营看起来非常怪异，墙壁苍白，没有任何装饰，连窗户和格栅都没装，屋顶也是歪歪斜斜的，瓦片被拆走了一些，从这些孔里会探出许多黑脑袋，在这通风的高处，深受牢狱之苦的他们，终于可以放眼饱览乡间壮阔的景致。唉！这些战俘营里的人真是受了很多苦，毫无疑问，从屋顶望出去的眼睛，大多会转向美丽的法兰西所在的方向。可怜的囚犯们遭了很多罪，申诉无门，这可以说是英格兰的耻辱—因为一般情况下，英格兰人是多么的友善而慷慨啊。囚犯的口粮包括腐肉，以及我看到的连狗都不太愿意吃的面包，就算是穷凶极恶的死敌，被俘虏之后陷入绝境，也不应当受这种待遇；唉！战俘营里的伙食就是如此糟糕。除此之外，还有来自军方的骚扰，或说是冷血的侵犯，用这地方的行话称之为“草辫子收缴行动”，理由是为了查处某件违禁物品，因为犯人们为了弄到一些生活的必需品，让自己过得稍微舒服一点，就做一些手工制品。身着红色军装的英国士兵冲进来亮出刺刀，毁掉了这些能工巧匠在战俘营里制造的东西；

然后他们胜利退场，带走了少得可怜的战利品，最可恶的是，他们还会放一把火把这些东西烧掉，在战俘营里举行什么“草辫子违禁品”大游行，就在屋顶那些怒火冲天的眼神注视下，他们还发出叫好声，不过通常会被上头暴风雨一样的咒骂声，或者是法国士兵发出的战斗口号“皇帝万岁”淹没。

上面是拿破仑麾下的士兵被俘虏之后的小花絮。这里还有一个片段值得一提，说明了他手下的老兵在战场受伤之后的姿态。这段文字出自默瑟上尉的《滑铁卢之战回忆录》。默瑟整天都在向法国骑兵团开炮，射程从五十到两百码不等，在战斗中他也损失了三分之二的火炮。黄昏时分，他亲眼看了自己的战果。

我的好奇心在霍高蒙特得到了满足，在山上，我沿着自己之前的足迹往回走，途中看到了一群受伤的法国士兵，其中一位伤者正在向其他人做演说，这一幕吸引了我的注意力，他演说起来是那么平静、庄严，充满战士的豪情。我没法像李维那样为我的英雄们写出辞藻华丽的鸿篇巨制，另外我也记不全当时听到的确切语句了，但是核心的内容是让他们以坚忍的意志来面对遭受的磨难，而不能像女人和孩子那样抱怨，因为每个士兵上了战场就要下定决心去接受苦难，更重要的是，要记住他们周围都是英国人，更应该加倍小心，不能流露出一点有辱士兵尊严的懦弱。

演说者席地而坐，他的长矛插在身旁，直直地冲着天空，这个老兵灰白的胡子很浓密，面容坚毅如同狮子—是一位拿破仑禁卫军的长矛轻骑兵，无疑他已经打了很多场仗。他一边说话，一边用一只手在空中挥舞，另一只手从手腕处断掉了，断手就在身体一侧的地上；一颗炮弹（可能是霰弹）射进了他的身体里，另一颗打断了他的腿。经过一夜的乱砍厮杀，他一定遭受了难以言喻的痛苦，但他没有表露分毫。他的样子就像是罗马战士，也像个印度战士，我想象他可能会用那位墨西哥国王的话来结束演讲：“于是我也倒下了；我会躺在玫瑰之床上吗？”

这个人身上承担了多少的道德责任啊！但是他已经对这些麻木了。要是不麻木，那他早就要被压垮了。现在如果你还想了解拿破仑的品格的话—不过说真的，在我开始这个影响重大的话题之前，我得从头开始讲。

在我说完军事回忆录之前，由于之前拦截通信的丑事，我希望能说点自己人的好话，提一下口碑一流的内皮尔[80]的六卷本“战争史”。这部书是关于半岛战争[81]的宏大故事，写书的人作为战士从头到尾亲历了这场战争，而且从来没有哪部历史回忆录给了自己的敌人那么多赞美，把他们描写成了英勇而坚韧的勇士。真的，在我看来，内皮尔做得有点过头了，因为他不仅对敌方勇敢的士兵充满了崇敬之情，还对他们领袖的品格和最终的目标满怀崇拜之情。实际上，在政治立场上，他是查尔斯·詹姆斯·福克斯的追随者，所以就算在他带领手下的士兵向敌军发起绝望攻势之时，他的心仍然向着敌军。总有人对自由充满向往，被一些政治斗争激发了自己的热情，反叛自己的祖国，而事实上，那个所谓自由的领袖其实是个军事独裁者—还是最不愿妥协的那种，历史所做的判决看起来总是荒谬无比。

虽然内皮尔的政治倾向很奇怪，但是他的军旅生涯精彩无比，而且在我的阅读范围之内，他的文笔也属于最佳之列。书里描写了巴达霍斯突围之战、燧发枪[82]兵团在阿尔布埃拉的冲锋战、法军在丰斯特德奥尼奥罗的先遣队的部分，只要你读过就一定忘不掉。这部作品是国家史诗伟大篇章的不朽之作。唉！就用这本书最后那个意义深远的句子来结束吧：“大战就这么结束了，随之而去的还有对参战老兵的所有记忆。”英国历史上的每一场战争也许都能以此作结吧。

我刚才引用的默瑟书里的段落，让我想起了那个时期英国人写的军事回忆录，虽然数量不多，形式也少，也不如法国人写的军事回忆录那么引人注目，但是一样也很有个性，读起来很有趣。我发现如果我在大型图书馆里随意逛上个半小时或更久，面对书的封面犹豫徘徊之后，我通常还是会拿起一本士兵回忆录。一个人表现得严肃认真的时候最有意思了，而当事件跟他的性命有关系时，他肯定再认真不过了。但是，最优秀的士兵不仅要精于战斗，还应该有基本教养，让他能够恰当地看待战斗本身，并能理解人类更温和的志向。默瑟就是这样一个人，他是冷静的战士，遵守纪律、坚守原则，即使炮弹在他两脚之间嘶嘶作响他也不会挪地方，同时他也是一个深沉善思、颇有哲学家气质的人，喜欢独自沉思，喜欢孩子和鲜花，这些都可能被看作他的弱点。他以炮兵指挥官的视角，写出了记录这场伟大战役的永恒经典之作。威灵顿将军麾下还有其他士兵也写过个人回忆录。你都可以读到，我书架上就有，就是缩减版本的《威灵顿的人马》（由菲切特博士编辑而成，版本尚佳）—高地人安东、步枪兵哈里斯，还有同一个兵团的金凯德，他们的回忆录都收录在里面。命运真是奇特，后来竟然是一位澳大利亚非国教的牧师以最富情感、最有力的布道形式重现了那些老英雄的形象，不过这也说明了不列颠民族的凝聚力，虽然我们散居在五十个不同的地方，但仍在为同一历史事件感到悲伤或喜悦。

在我结束这个离题万里的超长话题之前，我还有一句要说，就是在书架侧面的两本红色的书。它们是麦克斯维尔[83]的《威灵顿大传》，我觉得这部书写得极好，让人读起来手不释卷。读者会始终对那位伟大的战士怀有一种崇敬之情，却并非是那种热烈的喜爱，他手下的那些士兵就是这样。但要是知道他其实并不希望得到别人的爱慕的话，那我们的遗憾倒是能稍微减少一些。“别像个傻瓜似的，先生！”当一位好心的市民恭维他的时候，他这么训话。他性格中的这一点真是古怪又冷漠，显得粗暴又狭隘。再铁石心肠的猎人也会学着去喜欢自己的猎犬，但是对于那些为他效劳的人，他从未表露出任何柔情，反而时常斥责他们。“他们都是些人渣，”他说，“所有的英国兵入伍都是为了有酒喝。事实就是这么简单—他们参军是为了酒。”他下的将军令总是充满了不实的指责，而事实上，这种时候往往最夸张的赞扬都配不上他的士兵。战争结束之后，除了公务事宜，他几乎不会去见他的老战友。但是，如果这一仗要重来一遍，无论是少将还是鼓手，都会选择他作为领袖。他们其中一个说道：“看一眼他的高鼻梁，值战场上一万人。”他们自己都是些粗人，只要法国人在挨打，他们也不那么渴求温情和善意。

战时，他头脑清晰，随时警醒，但在处理内政事务上却似乎异常狭隘。作为一位政治家，他一直是尽职、牺牲、廉洁的化身，因为他的存在，国家总是向着好的方向发展。但是他一直都强烈反对天主教解放、改革法案等一切奠定我们现代生活的事物。他始终没有意识到，金字塔之所以能立着，靠的不是塔尖，而是塔底的基座，并且金字塔越大，基座也应该更宽。甚至在军事方面，他也十分反感变革，据我所知，在他权力如日中天的时期，没有任何进步的改革是由他发起的。在军中推行的鞭挞刑罚，足以摧毁士兵的士气和自尊，还有他穿着的皮袜子，极大限制了他的行动自由，而他却无比推崇这些旧的传统体制。另外，他还强烈反对毛瑟枪使用与燧石和钢片点火装置完全不同的火帽。无论是在战争时期，还是在后来的政治生涯中，他都没能正确地预见未来的发展。

不过，当我读到他的信件和公文的时候，他敏锐的洞察力和犀利的文笔有时令我感到诧异。在这一段文字中，他描述了军中有时会有逃兵跑到他正包围的某座城里。“他们知道，”他写道，“他们肯定会被抓起来，因为要是我们一旦决心攻下某地，肯定会成功，只是早晚的问题；但是他们却愿意暂时禁酒，去敌方当一下卧底，真是被英国人性格里普遍存在的古怪任性给害了！敌方通常都对我们的逃兵非常残忍，那些在法国的逃兵被视为最低等的人，就如奴隶和拾荒者一般。只能说是英国人的任性在作祟，也正是这种任性，让我们的贵族跟公共马车的马夫当朋友，或是干脆自己就成了公共马车的马夫。”读完这一段，“英国人性格里普遍存在的古怪任性”这句话就深深留在了我的脑海里，每次观察到新的例子，它就会浮现出来！

但是，关于这位伟大的公爵，我不想以吹毛求疵的方式来收尾。希望我最后一句话能让你想起他朴素而节制的生活方式，他房间的地板连地毯都没有，他只睡在一张小小的行军床上；他礼节周全，即使无名之辈的来信也一封不漏地回复；他英勇无畏，从未退缩；他坚韧不拔，从未动摇；他的责任感贯穿一生，为了祖国的至高利益而无私奉献。去圣保罗教堂昏暗的地下室，站在那巨大的石棺边上，在如此庄严肃穆的地方，会让你不禁回想起当年弱小的英格兰是怎样顽强抵抗有史以来最强大的统帅和他的军队的。这会让你想起这个逝去的伟人代表着什么，也会祈祷当战云再次聚集之时，我们当中还能找到这样的人。

你可以看到，我小小的军事图书馆中有不少关于滑铁卢战役的文献。在所有以个人视角叙述这场战役的书里面，我觉得《西伯恩书信集》最有趣。这本书诞生于一八二七年，是西伯恩收集的幸存军官的信件。格罗诺的描述也相当精彩，读起来很有意思。何塞的书则是我最喜欢的一本，他从法国的立场出发，比任何英国和德国的作者更准确地判断出了反法联盟军的战略；不过这场伟大的战役有一种特别的魅力，让所有关于它的文字记录都充满了扣人心弦的魔力。

威灵顿曾说这事儿被讲得过头了，让人觉得英国军队好像以前没打过仗似的。威灵顿是会这么说，但不得不承认，英国真的已经有几百年没打过这么重要的战役了，这场战役对整个欧洲战局产生了决定性的影响。这场战役总是让人心潮澎湃，它是一部漫长戏剧的最后一幕，而且在幕布落下之前，谁也不知道胜负如何—“我经历的实力最为接近的较量”[84]—胜利者如此描述。在战争持续的二十五年中，作战的物质条件和策略方法居然都没什么实质进步，这也是件匪夷所思的事情。就我所知，从一七八九年到一八一五年之间，根本没有什么值得一提的变化。后膛枪、重型火炮、装甲舰等所有战争艺术的伟大进步都产生于和平时期。然而，有的进步之处是那么明显，同时也至关重要，但是却没有被应用起来。比如，信号传输的变革，无论是应用日光反射，还是用挥舞旗帜来传输信息，都将给拿破仑的军事行动带来巨大改变。旗语通信的原则已经为人所知，比利时国土上有数不尽的风车，简直就是自带旗语的国度。但是在滑铁卢之战的那四天里，双方的军事行动都一再陷入危机，直到最后法国被彻底击败，完全是由于缺乏有效的情报传递系统，而情报其实很容易就能传递出来的。六月十八日是一个大晴天，只要用一面四英寸的镜子，就能让拿破仑和格鲁希[85]进行交流，要是这样，整个欧洲的历史都将改写。情报的缺失也让威灵顿吃够了苦头，那些情报本应该很容易就能提供。六月十五日凌晨四点，法军突然出现的情报就被收集到了，这个消息应该尽快传给身在布鲁塞尔的威灵顿将军，让他可以将分散的兵力集合起来组成最佳抵抗战线—然而，由于他们愚蠢地只派出了一个送信兵，威灵顿将军下午三点才收到这个重要情报，这段路程不过只有三十英里。还有，当布吕歇尔六月十六日在利尼被打败的时候，威灵顿应该马上知道他的撤退路线，以防法军在他们中间找到突破口，因此这个情报极为关键。但是受命送信的普鲁士士兵途中受了伤，没能抵达目的地，威灵顿直到第二天才得知普鲁士的计划。历史居然由这么微小的细节决定！





第九章


望着我的法国军人回忆录小军团，让我想到了拿破仑本人，你可以看到，我书架上跟他有关的书也很可观。那有一本司各特写的《拿破仑传》，不过并不是太成功。他的笔墨太珍贵，无法分配到这项大工程上。但是我有布列纳医生写的三卷本《拿破仑传》，这个布列纳可真是很了解他。谁能比一个人的医生更了解此人呢？这套书写得很精彩，翻译也很好。还有梅纳瓦尔[86]写的书，梅纳瓦尔很有耐心，他要跟上日常谈话的速度，不停地速记，不知道连续写过多少个小时，而且要保持字迹清楚，记录还不能出错。至少他的雇主不能批评他的字迹难以辨认，不是有这样一件事被记录在案吗？拿破仑亲手起草的一份有关订婚的文书传到了参议院议长那里，而这位可敬的先生竟以为那是一份作战计划[87]。梅纳瓦尔比拿破仑活得长，留下了关于拿破仑的记录，文笔精彩，有详尽的细节。还有康斯坦[88]的书，也证明了英雄非完人。但是，在所有把拿破仑的邪恶形象描写得栩栩如生的书里面，最令人难忘的一本书却出自一个与他从未谋面的作者，而且所写的内容也不是主要关于他的。我指的是泰纳笔下的拿破仑，就在《当代法国的起源》的第一卷。一旦你读过他的文字，肯定终生难忘。他巧妙地营造了一种文字氛围，在我看来，就像在读小说一样。他并不只是简单地说拿破仑就像个诡计多端的中世纪意大利人，而是提供了一连串的文件记录，用当时的实例来证明了这个观点。通过一个个详尽的例证，他把这个观点在读者的脑中确立起来之后，又把拿破仑性格的另一侧面告诉给读者—他绝情又好色，做事情精力充沛，像被宠坏的孩子一样任性；或者他性格的其他方面，然后泰纳用自己的方法将它刻画了出来。比如，他不直接说拿破仑对细节的记忆力如何惊人，我们读到的是这样一则例子：炮兵团团长把登记着法国所有枪支的清单放到了他的领袖面前，后者浏览了一遍，然后说：“不错，但是你漏掉了两支枪，在迪耶普附近的一座堡垒里。”就这样，他的形象逐渐清晰，不可磨灭。到最后，你的脑海里会留下一个绝妙的人物形象，像一个天使长，但无疑是一个有阴暗面的天使长。

让我们依照泰纳的方法，找个例子，让事实说话。拿破仑在他的遗嘱附录里，给一个试图刺杀威灵顿将军的人留了一份遗产。这又是中世纪意大利人的风格了！他不是正宗的科西嘉人[89]，正如在印度出生的英国人不是真正的印度人一样。读一读博尔吉亚家族[90]、斯福尔扎家族[91]和美第奇家族[92]的故事，还有所有那些贪婪、残忍、有远见、爱艺术、有天赋的暴君，他们都出自意大利的小城邦，其中也包括热那亚，波拿巴家族的人就是从那里移居到科西嘉岛的。这样你就立即明白他真正的祖先是谁了，他祖先的一切印记在他身上都清晰可见—外表冷峻，内心激昂，如冰雪覆盖在火山之上，就像他家乡的那些古时候的暴君，都是马基雅维利[93]的徒弟，但是在他身上，这些品格登峰造极，成就了一个天才。随你怎样美化他，但是，他居然为刺客背书，有意要置高贵的对手于死地，这一污点怎么也无法遮掩。

还有一本书也把这个男人写得异常形象生动—《德雷穆萨夫人回忆录》。她在宫廷里每天都能见到拿破仑，她用一双聪明女子的慧眼仔细地观察了他，当不因爱情而盲目的时候，这种女子的眼睛从不出错。在你读过书里的内容之后，会觉得自己亲眼见过他，还跟他说过话。你会看到渺小与伟大在他身上奇异地混合在一起，会看到他拥有恢宏的想象力，见识却非常有限，自我意识极为强烈，对绊脚石完全无法容忍，举止粗鲁，对女性粗俗而无礼，残忍地利用身边每个人的弱点达到自己的目的—这些描写让他成了最令人难以忘怀的历史人物之一。

我大部分关于拿破仑的藏书都写的是他如何伟大，但是这里有一部三卷本的书，写的是他在圣赫勒拿岛[94]上的落魄岁月。看到被关进笼子的雄鹰，谁能不心生唏嘘？然而，如果你要参与伟大的游戏，那也得付出自己的代价。但也是这个人，曾经把一位王室的公爵枪杀在了阴沟里，就因为那位公爵可能威胁他登上王位。他自己不就威胁到了欧洲所有的王位吗？你可能会说，为什么他被流放到圣赫勒拿岛那么萧条荒凉的地方呢？要知道他之前曾经被流放到一个更温和宜人的岛上过[95]，但是他逃走了，后来有五万人因为这个错误的仁慈之举付出了生命代价。现在的人都不记得这些了，现在，人们的头脑中只有这样一幅悲壮的画面—一位现代的普罗米修斯被束缚在巨石上，被自己的痛苦所化成的秃鹰吞噬着。世人总是容易跟着情绪走，而不管理智，尤其是你不费力就能给予宽容，只需要间接地表示慷慨。但是我们仍要坚持理性，要明白欧洲并没有以报复之心对待拿破仑，而且哈德逊·罗威[96]只是在认真履行他的国家交给他的职责。

在这么一个岗位上，谁能奢望留下什么好名声呢。如果他管理松懈，待人随和，那可能没人会讲他的坏话。但如果这样，拿破仑可能再次逃脱，造成严重后果。如果他管理严格，毫不松懈，那肯定会被描述成一个无良暴君。“有你在前哨我很放心，”罗威的将军在一次战役中这么说，“这样我就能好好歇着了。”哈德逊·罗威在圣赫勒拿岛上做前哨，因为他坚守职责，整个欧洲（当然也包括法国）都能好好歇着。但是他为此失去了自己的好名声。那个全世界最厉害的阴谋家满身精力无处发泄，于是就费尽心思地去诋毁看守他的人。一个从没有被控制过的人，现在也不可能允许别人来管他，这是很自然的事。而那些不加思考的多愁善感之辈，也很容易站在那位皇帝的立场看问题。然而，我们自己的国人居然被一些片面资料误导，让这个男人做了舆论的牺牲品，而他在一个充满焦虑和危险的岗位上，忠诚地履行着国家赋予的职责，这重担要落在别人身上，早就承受不住了。这真是令人惋惜。让多愁善感的人记住蒙托隆说的话吧：“就算天上派的天使也不能让我们满意。”他们也应该记住罗威的话，他从不缺少为自己声辩的实证。“我只是在尽我的职责，其他的我并不关心。”在他去看那位皇帝的时候，他这么说。这句话并不是随口说说而已。

法国文学的每个分支里都有众多佳作，除了在这个特殊的时代，在其他时代，法国文学中最浓重的一笔也莫过于回忆录。一旦发生了什么有趣的事情，就会有些爱打听、爱传播的热心人知道所有的经过，并且准备把这事儿写下来，留给后世子孙看。英国的文学史上这种好玩的杂记就远远不够。就拿跟拿破仑打仗的英国海军士兵来说吧，可以说，他们是改变历史的重要角色。在战争中长达二十年里，只有在海上才算有自由。如果英国的海军被打败了，那整个欧洲都要变成一个集权的独裁体了。有时候几乎每个国家都与英国为敌，在铁拳的重压下，他们不得不与自己的利益为敌。英国在海上跟法国人打过仗，跟西班牙人打过仗，跟丹麦人打过仗，跟俄国人打过仗，跟奥斯曼帝国打过仗，甚至还跟英国同根同源的美国人打过仗。在漫长的战争中，见习生成长为舰长，将军则都变成了老糊涂。可是英国有哪些文学作品记述了这些事呢？有马里亚特[97]的一些小说，里面很多事件都根据他亲身经历写成；有纳尔逊[98]和科灵伍德的信件；还有柯克伦[99]的自传—就只有这些了。我多希望科灵伍德能再多写一些啊，他的文笔真的是非常不错。还记得他写给手下舰长的特拉法尔加[100]公报吗，开头多么掷地有声！

我们怀着沉痛的心情哀悼舰队总司令纳尔逊子爵、勃朗特公爵[101]，他在二十一日的行动中阵亡，倒在了胜利女神怀抱中，赢得了至高的荣耀，英国海军和英国人民将永远铭记他的英勇事迹；他为国王之荣誉和本国之利益抛洒热血，永远都是英国海军的光辉榜样。他为国捐躯，对此，我怀有无限感激。

传达这样信息的语句竟写得如此精彩，实在令人敬佩，而且他写这份公报的时候正值狂风暴雨，多少战舰正在沉入海中。但是总的来说，这方面的好作品还是太少了。当然了，海军士兵哪有时间写那么多东西呢，但是我还是会忍不住遐想，千万海军之中要是有谁能认识到他们的经历将成为后世的财富，那该有多好！我想起了曾经停在朴次茅斯港口的炮舰，它们三层夹板都装了炮台，却只能在那里腐烂。我常常想，要是它们能讲出它们自己的故事，将给我们文学史补上多么丰富的篇章！

法国人的好运不仅体现在拥有众多拿破仑传记，路易十四时代也非常有趣，其间诞生的文学作品甚至更加丰富多彩。一旦深入挖掘，这方面的书简直多得让人震惊，似乎太阳王宫廷里的男男女女都在暴露他们邻人的隐私。就拿圣西蒙[102][103]的《回忆录》来说吧，视角全面，包含私密细节，比我所知的任何写维多利亚时代的英国作品都要好得多。圣埃弗雷芒的作品也几乎同样全面。你想看优秀女性写出的作品吗？可以读德塞维涅夫人的书信集（总计有八卷），它算得上有史以来最优秀的女性书信集。你想读浪子回头的故事吗？有德拉克罗雷公爵写的色情回忆录，他可算是个顽劣浪子，我们当然不是为了看发生在育儿室或是香闺之中的情事，而是想通过他的作品看到那个时代怪异而又私密的一面。这几本书相互映照，某些人物在不同书中反复出现，你还没读完就会非常了解这些人了：他们的爱恨情仇，经历的决斗和阴谋，以及最终结局。如果你不想读这么深，那只读茱莉亚·帕尔多的四卷本《路易十四宫廷秘史》就可以了，这是一部非常不错的简缩版本—或者说是精华本也不为过，书里都是干货。还有一本也很好—就在我的书架底层—是一本有棕色和金色封面的大书。这本书算得上一件奢侈品了—花了我好几金镑[104]—但它真的很值，书中刻画了一群显赫的人物—路易十四、虔诚的曼特农夫人、脆弱的蒙特斯潘夫人、博须埃主教、弗奈隆、莫里哀、拉辛、帕斯卡尔、孔代、蒂雷纳等那时所有的圣人和罪人。假如你想犒赏一下自己，面前正好有本《路易十四时代宫廷实录》，它绝不会让你觉得白花了钱。

好了，朋友，你真的是很有耐心，因为我讲得实在太多了，不过，我确实非常喜欢读回忆录，无论是关于拿破仑的还是关于其他主题的，我都喜欢，它们给枯燥的历史记录注入了一丝人气。并不是说历史本身很枯燥，历史应该是世上最有趣的主题，讲述了我们自己、我们祖先和全人类的故事，正是这些事件造就了今日的我们。而且，如果魏斯曼[105]的遗传理论不过时，我们栖居的这具躯体的某些微小部分也能在其中找到源头。但很不幸，积累知识与传授知识要求人具备完全不同的能力，于是，历史学家往往缺乏创见，仅是庄严地编纂出了一部增容版年鉴而已。更恶劣的是，如果有谁把趣味和想象力加进去，具备了把枯骨写活的能力，那些迂夫子就会去攻击他，说偏离正轨肯定会导致与事实不符。弗鲁德就受过这样的批判。麦考莱当时也是。但是我们现在仍然在读他们的书，那些学究早就被遗忘了。你若问在我心中历史书的理想范本是什么样的，我会给你指那边书架上的两排书，一排有麦卡锡所著的《当代历史》，另一排有莱基的《十八世纪英格兰史》。有意思的是，这两位作者都是爱尔兰人，难得的是，尽管他们政治立场与我们相反，并且生活在一个爱尔兰事态引发诸多苦果的年代，他们的突出之处不仅在于文采，还在于阔达宽容地指出了问题的每一个方面，从来都是以哲学家视角观察，从未落入偏执党派主义的窠臼。

既然我们说到了历史话题，那你读过帕克曼[106]的书吗？我觉得，他可以算得上最伟大历史学家之一，但是人们却很少听说过他。他出生在美国的新英格兰地区，主要写美国和法属加拿大定居点的早期历史，所以英国人很少听说他倒是情有可原，可我发现很多美国人竟然也没读过他的作品。在那边，我有四本他的书，封面是绿色和金色，《加拿大的耶稣会士》和《弗兰特纳克》。但是他还写了其他值得一读的书，比如《法国先行者》《蒙特卡姆与沃尔夫》《发现伟大西部》，等等。我希望哪一天能拥有全套他的书。

就说《加拿大的耶稣会士》这一本书吧，它绝对能得好评。对一个流着清教徒血液的人来说，这真是一首献给清教主义的礼赞！在他笔下，那些佩戴十字架的勇士侵入了加拿大，正如他们去中国和其他地方一样，不惧危险，甚至置生死于度外。不管一个人信仰什么神，也不管他是不是基督徒，在他读这些真实的记录之时，他肯定会禁不住赞叹这些了不起的人，在他们身上可以看到人类圣洁与虔诚的最高境界。他们是名副其实的文明先驱，除了把欧洲最先进的文化带给野蛮人，他们自身的行为就可以给后人上一课，告诉人们如何过简朴、自律、高贵的一生。法国曾把无数勇士送到了战场上，然而，我觉得在其所有的荣耀史中，也只有参加易洛魁远征的人，才称得上坚忍不拔、英勇不屈。

他们如何高贵地生活构成了这本书的主体，他们如何平静地死去是这本书的结局。就算现在读来，也会让人感到战栗—真是恐怖的噩梦。狂热主义有可能让人振奋，暂时遗忘痛苦—就像马赫迪[107]在喀什穆[108]领导的苏丹人大起义。但是读《加拿大的耶稣会士》这本书，我们至少能感觉到那是一种更为高贵的情感，他们缓慢而冷血地忍受着毫无回报的生活，最后迎来了那么可怕的死亡。每种宗教都能吹嘘自己有多少殉道者—想到这一点真是让人痛苦，这说明千万人错误地流了血。但是，这些人在证明自己信仰的同时，也证明了更重要的东西，那就是人如何放弃肉体，臣服于至高精神的绝对领导。

约格神父[109]的故事就是其中一个例子，但是值得一说，因为他代表了那些人的精神。他也参加了易洛魁远征，却被他可爱的“教友们”折磨致残，肢体扭曲的样子连狗看到他都会哀号。他终于回到了法国，但不是为了休养和康复，而是因为他需要得到特赦令做弥撒。天主教会有规定，神父不能有残疾，野蛮人的刀比他们预想的还要凶残。他得到了特赦令，路易十四还召见了他，问能为他做点什么。宫廷里的大臣以为他肯定会要一个空缺的主教职位。然而，他只是请求让他再去易洛魁传教，他到了那儿，野蛮人迎接他的方式却是把他活活烧死。

帕克曼的书也值得一读，单是他记述的印第安人历史就非常好。关于他们最奇怪、最不可理解的一点，就是他们人口很少。易洛魁人是印第安各部落中最让人闻风丧胆的势力之一。他们由五大部落组成，部落里一伙伙剥头皮的队伍[110]在方圆上千英里的广阔草原上游荡。但是，我们有理由怀疑，五大部落联合起来到底有没有能力向战场输送成千上万的战士。北美其他印第安部落也是一样的情况，东边、北边、西边都是，他们的人口数量从来都是那么微不足道。但是，他们占据着那么广阔的土地，那里气候适宜，食物充足，为什么他们没有繁衍更多人口呢？这或许可以作为一个不同寻常的例子说明人类发展背后的目标和原理，正当旧世界人口要满溢之时，新世界正好很空，能装得下。如果当时北美的人口跟中国一样多，欧洲人可能在那里建立几个定居点，但是永远也不可能占据整个大陆。布冯有过这样惊人的论断，说北美地区的创造力从来没有爆发过活力。但他提到了那里的动植物资源，比地球上其他地区都要丰富。印第安人的人口问题是不是创造力不活跃这一事实的例证呢？还是说有其他特别的原因？以我有限的科学知识，实在无法解答这个问题。不过，当我们想起大陆西部平原上曾经遍布无数成群的野牛，看看如今大陆一端法裔加拿大人的人口，再看看另一端南方黑人的数量，实在无法想象地理因素可以阻止自然繁育的力量。不过，这个问题就太深奥了，如果您允许，我还是回到平常话题中去吧。





第十章


我都不知道这两本小书是怎么跑到那里去的。它们是亨里爵士[111]的《剑之歌》和《诗集一卷》，本应该被放在那边窄窄的诗集区。也许我实在太喜欢他的书了，无论是他的散文还是诗歌，所以就把它们放在了我随时能拿到的地方。他可真是一位了不起的人，虽然他的作品也很伟大，但是他本人要伟大得多。我从来没遇到过像他那样，那么有魅力，那么激励他人的人。你与他道别之后的状态就像是电池离开充电站，感觉被充满了能量，浑身是劲儿。他让你觉得世上还有许多未尽之事需要你去完成，而你有能力去做这些事情，是多么令人欣喜，并且此时此刻就应该马上着手去干。他拥有巨人般的体形和活力，但是却被残忍地剥夺了一切释放能量的机会，于是他将其凝练成热烈的文字、温暖的同情、激烈的偏见，以及一切充满人性和令人振奋的感情。他的许多时间和精力都用于鼓励他人，如果他用在自己身上，原本可为自己赢得不朽的声誉；但这样做也并没有白费，因为凡得到他鼓励的人，都受到了他深刻的影响。如今，就有数十个“亨里第二”是我们文学界的中流砥柱呢。

唉，可惜我们只能看到他的一部分佳作。而这些就是我们时代最好的作品。没有多少诗人像他一样，能连续写出那么高尚、那么有力的十六行诗句，此诗以如下四行作为开头：

透过将我包裹的黑夜，

我看见漆黑层层无底，

感谢那些存在的神灵，

赐我不可征服的灵魂。

这是伟大的文学之声，也是他的勇气的伟大证明，因为它来自一个饱受摧残的人，他没有任何过错，却像疯长的灌木一样不断被医生的手术刀修剪。他说：

命运之手要将我毁灭，

我没有畏缩，也不会叫喊，

任凭命运百般作弄，

我虽满头鲜血，但绝不低头。

拜伦夫人说这是诗人在发出“小丑般的悲鸣”，不，这不是悲鸣，而是一位印第安战士在火刑柱上表达的极大蔑视，他在用高傲的灵魂控制着战栗的身体。

亨里的诗歌有两种截然不同的风格，几乎是相互对立的。一种是英雄主义风格—气势雄浑，充满了宏大意象和铿锵有力的词语。例如《剑之歌》等作品，就像是北方战士唱的粗犷战歌。而另一种呢，我觉得代表了他更有特色、更精致的创作风格—优美、清晰、用词考究，用简洁、恰当的语言仔细描绘了一幅幅生动的小图景。比如《病榻诗丛》。而《伦敦志愿者》则处于两种风格中间。什么？你还没读过《病榻诗丛》？那赶紧把《诗集一卷》拿下来开始读吧。不管好坏，你的收获一定独一无二。读完之后，你一定说不出—至少我说不出—能与之相比的诗歌。戈德史密斯和克拉布也写过室内主题的诗，但读起来是那么单调，所以不管它们韵律多么铿锵，都会让现代读者感到厌倦。可是亨里的诗是那么灵活多变，那么激动人心。这些诗歌多么优秀！让我们诅咒耗尽了他心力的周刊和导师工作，让他离世之时仅留下了五本小册子！

当然了，这些都是题外话，因为它们跟这个书架上的书没一点关系。这个角落我用来放各种各样的编年史。这里就有排成一列的三本，能带你尽览精彩的法国历史（当然通常也是欧洲历史），巧合的是，当一本完结之时，另一本的内容正好能接上。第一本的作者是傅华萨[112]，第二本是德蒙斯特雷[113]，第三本是德柯米尼斯[114]。读完这三本书，你会得到百年历史的最佳一手记录，对于有文字记录的人类历史而言，这已经是相当可观的一段时间了。

傅华萨的书绝对精彩绝伦。如果你不想读中世纪法语的版本，这个版本恐怕只有专家才能读出什么乐趣来，你可以读伯纳斯爵士的英语译本，虽然也是中世纪的英语，但是语言非常优美；或者你可以找一个现代英语的译本，像我这本就是琼斯的译本。伯纳斯爵士的译本读上一页倒是令人心情愉悦，但是要读完好几卷厚厚的中古英语，恐怕还是负担太重。我个人更喜欢读现代英语的版本，当你读完，合上厚重的下册书时，就已经说明你是个很有耐心的读者了。

我在想，这位埃诺的老教士有没有意识到他在做的事情有多大的意义—他脑海里是否闪过这样的念头，那就是，有一天他写下的书会成为一部伟大的权威典籍，不仅对于研究他所处的时代，而且对研究整个骑士制度亦是如此。我觉得他写这本书的全部心思，可能只是想从各路男爵、骑士身上得到些世俗方面的好处，他在书里记录了他们的名号，颂扬了他们的英勇事迹。例如，他自己就记录过在他出访英格兰宫廷时，随身带着自己装订精美的作品；如果我们跟着这位教士一起走，会发现他在其他行程中也会带自己的作品，那或许是馈赠的佳品，极为贵重。想想，受赠者看到这样一本记录自己英名的书，作为拥有骑士之魂的人，会如何回报这位作者呢？

好了，我们不用过多揣测他的动机，不得不说，这部作品写得可真是详尽无比。在教士那种活泼、轻快、喋喋不休、随心所欲的风格之下，还真有一点希罗多德[115]的影子。而且就准确度而言，他比那个希腊老伙计还略胜一筹。要知道，在他那个年代，连约翰·曼德维尔爵士编出来的游记都被读者认真地当成了参考书，所以，我觉得我们这位编年史作者能写得这么仔细而准确真是难得，就比如他笔下的苏格兰和苏格兰人。有的人可能觉得这是让·勒贝尔的功劳，但那又是另一码事儿了。对于一个十四世纪的埃诺居民来说，要写好苏格兰这个主题，应该允许他发挥一点自己的想象力。可是我们会发现，他的描述就整体而言准确度都非常高。盖勒韦的小马、浅锅烘饼、苏格兰风笛—每一个细节都那么真实。让·勒贝尔实际参加的是苏格兰边境的战斗，傅华萨就是从他那里得到的资料，但是他没有添油加醋，至于信息的准确性，从某种程度上来说，我们也可以对其进行验证，而当我们无法确认的时候，也可以先接受它。

但是傅华萨老人作品里最有趣的部分，应该是他写的那个时代的骑士和游侠，以及他们的事迹、习惯和说话的方式。他生活的时期确实已经过了骑士时代的全盛阶段；但是他生活的那个时期还不算晚，他见到过很多被誉为“骑士之花”的人。这些人也读过他的书，并给过评价（他们中很多人识字），所以我们可以肯定他的文字不会是浮夸的描述，而是如实地描述了书里那些战士。前后的描写也非常一致。如果你把骑士说的话进行对照（我有一次就这么做过），你会发现这些话始终惊人地统一。我们有理由相信，这本书真实地呈现了那些在克雷西和普瓦捷战斗过的人，那时候法国国王和苏格兰国王都被囚禁在伦敦，英格兰那时正处于军事实力的巅峰，这在英格兰的历史上可以说是前所未有的。

从某一个方面来说，傅华萨作品中的骑士跟我们在历史传奇小说里读到的很不一样。我们回到前面，再看看最会写传奇故事的司各特先生，就会发现他作品中的中世纪骑士通常都是正值盛年、身强体健的人，比如基尔勃、贝奥武甫、理查德、艾凡赫、罗伯特伯爵—他们都是那样。但是在某些情况下，傅华萨笔下最著名的骑士往往年纪都很大，腿瘸了，眼睛也瞎了。尚多斯，他那个年代最厉害的长矛轻骑兵，在战场丢掉性命的时候，都已经七十好几了，他头部一侧被击中，这一侧的眼睛早就瞎了。在纳瓦雷特之战的那个清晨，当他从英国军队里骑马冲出去杀死大个子马滕·法拉拉的时候，他就已经快到那个年龄了，对方可是西班牙军队中最优秀的士兵。当然了，年轻的身体和力量很有用，特别是在身穿重型盔甲的年代，但是只要骑上了战马，英勇的骏马就会弥补骑士力量的不足。在英国的捕猎围场里，许多年迈衰弱的老人只要稳稳地坐上他们熟悉的马鞍，就能让年轻人甘拜下风。骑士也是如此。那些活得比其他人久的骑士，仍然能上战场，他们足智多谋，有丰富的作战的经验，最重要的是，他们拥有冷静且无所畏惧的勇气。

尽管傅华萨是在用文字粉饰骑士精神，但不可否认，骑士通常都是嗜血而残暴的野蛮人，作战的时候对敌人毫不留情，除非有可能拿到赎金。尽管骑士有种种野蛮残暴的行为，但他本质上却是个无忧无虑的人，像是一个在玩恐怖游戏的令人害怕的小男孩。他谨守自己那些奇怪的规则，并且只要他的阶层允许，即使在战时，他仍然充满真情和同情心。这类人不像现在在战争中的法国人和德国人那样，他们那个时候在交战时不会针对个人，或是彼此充满恨意。相反，对阵的双方说话都很温柔，彼此很有礼貌。“我可以帮您解除哪些小小的誓言束缚呢？”“您希望您的兵器在我身上产生一点效果吗？”在对决的时候，他们还会短暂地休息片刻，同时进行友好对话，称赞对方高超的本领。苏格兰人西顿跟一队法国骑士交手之后，他觉得双方过的招儿已经够了，于是就说：“谢谢，先生们，谢谢你们！”随即就骑马跑开了。一个英国骑士立下了誓言，“为了他自己的晋升，也为了让自己爱慕的女士开心”，要骑马前去敌方的巴黎城，用他的长矛碰到城内的壁垒。这是骑士年代最具代表性的故事。当他骑马冲过去的时候，壁垒周围见到他立誓的法国骑士并没有对他发起进攻，反而对他喊说他做得很好。但是，在他返回的时候，路边一个拿着斧子的屠夫，一个不讲礼貌的人，在他路过的时候杀死了他。写编年史的作者在此就停笔了；但是我敢说法国骑士肯定不会让那个屠夫好过，眼看着他们中的一分子落得如此不堪的结局，就算他是敌方骑士，也不会袖手旁观。

同样作为编年史作者，德柯米尼斯没有傅华萨那么有趣，也比他传统得多。但是，历史传奇小说作者仍然可以从德柯米尼斯的作品里挖掘出不少素材，用来建构自己的故事。当然了，昆廷·杜沃德的故事全都来自德柯米尼斯的书里。还有路易十一的完整历史，他跟大胆查理的关系，在普莱西斯—勒—图尔斯的奇怪岁月，他平民出身的侍臣、理发师、刽子手，还有占星师，他时而像个野人一样残暴，时而又是迷信的奴仆—这些故事都是从德柯米尼斯的书里开始流传出来的。你会觉得这样一个君主肯定是独一无二的，他身上混合而成的奇怪品格和骇人的罪行肯定无人可比，然而，相似的原因总带来相似的结果。读一读瓦莱夫斯基的《可怕的伊凡大帝》，你就会发现一个世纪之后的俄国出现了比路易十一还要糟糕的君王，而且坏起来跟路易一模一样，甚至能从一些细微之处发现相同点。一样的残暴，一样的迷信，一样信任占星师，同样喜欢跟出身低微的人打交道，同样住在大城市影响不到的地方—真是像得不能再像。如果你读完伊凡的历史，还没被他的暴行彻底震惊到，你可以接着读这位作者写的彼得大帝的历史。真是神奇的国度！君王们一个个都这么像！充满鲜血、冰雪的冷酷之国！伊凡和彼得都杀了自己的儿子。而且其中都充斥着一种可怕的宗教感，尤其显得荒诞而恐怖。我们国家有一个亨利八世，但是我们这个最坏的国王要是在俄国也算得上一个仁慈的明君。

关于传奇故事和骑士风范，我想，那边底下有一本书，在它破烂不堪的封面和封底之间的内容可以说无比丰富。它就是华盛顿·欧文的《征服格拉纳达》。我不知道他从哪里找的素材，我想可能是从西班牙的编年史中吧。不过，摩尔人[116]和基督教骑士之间的战争绝对可以说是最能代表骑士精神的壮举了。我找不出有哪本书能像这本一样把其中的壮美和荣耀表现得这么淋漓尽致：长矛的尖头在黑暗的峡谷中闪光，红色的营火在悬崖边熊熊燃烧，他写出了身着盔甲的基督徒坚毅、虔诚之心，写出了风度翩翩的穆斯林的儒雅和有礼的勇气。就算华盛顿·欧文没写别的书，这本书也完全能敲开任何图书馆的大门。他所有的书我都喜欢，因为没有谁能像他那样把英语这种语言写得清爽而纯粹；同时，我最常读的也是这本《征服格拉纳达》。

让我们再来看一下讲述历史故事的传奇小说吧，这边并排放着两本外国作家写的书，风格非常新颖。据我所知，这两位作家目前都还只出版了两部作品。封面是绿色和金色的这套包括了波美拉尼亚人[117]梅因霍德的两本书—怀尔德女士的优质译本。第一本是《女法师西多尼娅》，第二本是《琥珀女巫》。我觉得没有哪本书像它们这样以如此奇异的方式，呈现了中世纪的样貌，能看到日常生活中那些离奇有趣的细节，其中偶尔穿插着诡异的暴行。在书中，就连最怪异、最野蛮的行为也被描绘得很人性化、可以被理解了。有一个故事我读完之后久久不能释怀：一个行刑者在跟村民讨价还价，他们要对一个年轻女巫实施酷刑，他的要价从一桶苹果涨到了一桶半，理由是他年纪大了，还有风湿病，弯下身使劲会伤到腰。而且行刑这事要在山的斜坡上完成，这样那些“可爱的小孩子”能看得清楚。《女法师西多尼娅》和《琥珀女巫》让我看到了古老德国的另一面，在别的地方我从没见过。

但是梅因霍德属于一个久远的世代。我在另一位作家的书里发现了一种新的风格，而且属于大师之列，我没记错的话，那就是梅列日科夫斯基。他还年轻，未来还大有可为。《先行者》和《诸神之死》是我目前仅能得到的他的两本书，一本描述了文艺复兴时期的意大利，另一本描述了罗马帝国的衰落。在我看来，这两本书都算得上大师级的小说作品。我得承认，在读这两本书的时候，我感到非常快乐，因为我发现我的思想还能开明地接受新的东西。因为当一个人上了年纪，在精神方面最危险的就是总是固守自己最喜欢的口味，没空间接受新事物，还会让自己相信有好东西产生的伟大时代已经结束了，但其实是他自己的脑袋僵化了。你只要看一下文学评论的文章就知道这种病有多严重了，但是，稍微了解一点文学史，就知道文学评论一直都是这样，年轻作家总会遭到恶意批评，从而受到打击，从一开始就是这样。他只有一个办法，那就是不要管这些评论，而是努力去达到自己的最高水准，将剩下的交给时间和读者。在我书橱的侧面，我把一首打油诗钉在了上面，它也许能在某位年轻的作家兄弟心绪烦乱的时刻给他一些宁静：

评论家对你好—别管他！

评论家奉承你—无所谓！

评论家怪罪你—他们总这样！

评论家咒骂你—别受影响！

自己做到最好—其他都别管！





第十一章


我一直在用过去时谈论那些英雄和骑士游侠，但是他们的故事并未过时。等到地球上的土地都被开发，所有的野蛮人都被驯化，最后一架加农炮被拆卸掉，世界都处在坚不可摧的美德统治下，也处于一种难以描述的沉闷之中，到那时人们就会回想起我们这个时代，会将我们的传奇故事和勇气赋予理想化的色彩，正如我们现在遥想往昔时代的祖先一样。“这些人用如此原始的工具和有限的器具竟然能完成这些伟业！”当未来的人们读到我们的探险、航海和战争的记录时，就会如此感慨。

现在，来看看我游记书架的第一本书。它是奈特[118]的《小鹰号历险记》。将“奈特”这个名字赋予他，真是上天的旨意（奈特的名字字面意思是“骑士”）。读一读他的这份文字记录，然后来告诉我哈克卢特学会出版的航海历险书里有没有比它更有趣的。如果我记得没错，这本书讲的是两个从未出过海的人—两个律师，去了南安普顿码头，叫上了一个年轻的码头工人，登上一艘小船，就这么出海了。他们到了哪儿呢？布宜诺斯艾利斯。然后他们又穿过乌拉圭，回到了西印度群岛，在那里卖掉了小船，回了家。伊丽莎白女王时代的海员还有谁能做得更多吗？现在没有西班牙的大帆船[119]让单调的航程变得更有趣了，但是如果他们有这样的大船，我觉得我们的这两位冒险家一定也会得到一份儿达布隆金币的宝藏。但是，他们的航海之旅更加高尚，因为他们不是受财宝的诱惑出海的，而是纯粹渴望冒险，是在回应大海的呼唤。尽管有大礼帽、礼服大衣和平淡的背景做掩饰，这种古老的精神仍然存在人们内心。也许随着时间的流逝，他们也会被蒙上一层浪漫色彩。

另一本展现传奇与英雄主义在当下仍然不灭的书，就是斯科特上校[120]的《南极发现之旅》。这本书完全是海员的风格，丝毫没有夸大或粉饰的语言，却依然给人留下了极为深刻的印象（也许正是它的风格平实才达到了这样的效果）。当我边读这本书边思考读到的内容时，似乎更清楚地知道了哪些品质造就了最优秀的英国人。每个国家都有勇敢的人，每个国家也都有精力旺盛的人，但是有一种人，他们集勇气和精力于一身，温和谦逊，有赤子之心，这种人品德最高尚。在这本书里，整个探险队似乎都被他们指挥官的个人精神感染。从不退缩，从不抱怨，乐观地面对每一个困难，没有人顾及私利，大家都是为了整个探险事业的成功在努力。当你读到记录他们极度缺乏生活必需品的部分时，看到他们是如此坚韧，让你不禁为抱怨日常生活的那些小烦恼而感到羞愧。读到斯科特的队员们有的眼睛瞎了，有的得了坏血病，但仍然踉踉跄跄地坚持朝着目的地前行。看到这些，如果你还能抱怨得出口，那么，继续抱怨北方的阳光太猛烈，或者乡下路上尘土太多吧。

这就是现代生活的一个不足之处。我们抱怨太多了，而且不以此为耻。曾经，风气可不是这样—那时候，没种的人才会抱怨。绅士永远都得是一个坚忍克己的人，他灵魂高贵，根本不会受世俗生活的小烦恼影响。“先生，您看起来很冷。”一个好心的英国人对一位法国流亡贵族说。这位落难的贵族理了理他褴褛的衣衫，说：“先生，绅士永远都不会觉得冷。”一个人但凡为他人着想，但凡还有自尊，就不会再抱怨什么。这样自我克制、隐藏痛苦的行为，是过去信奉“贵人应有高尚品德”的典型例子，但现在已经很少见了，顶多只算一种传统。对此，我们的公众舆论应该更坚定才是。那些因为小腿被撞到就要跳起来的人，或是指节被擦伤了就不停把手拧来拧去的人，应该让他们明白这种行为不会获得同情，只会招来鄙视。

去北极探险也是美国人的一项高尚传统，跟我们国家一样。接下来的这本书就是一个合适的例子。格里利[121]的《北极工作三年》可以跟斯科特的《南极发现之旅》一起参照来读。这本书里记录的某些事件，真是让人永生难忘。有一节写，二十余人都躺在那个环境恶劣的海崖边上，每天都有一个人因寒冷、饥饿，或坏血病死去。对比之下，我们这些微不足道的悲剧故事简直太渺小了。在那里，他们英勇的队长饥饿难耐，却仍在向队员讲抽象的科学知识，以转移垂死之人的注意力，试图让他们从痛苦中解脱—多么富有感染力的画面啊！在寒冷、饥饿和黑暗中生活，是多么艰难的事，但是他们竟然能够坚持六个月之久，最后还有人活了下来，把这件事告诉世人，真是一个奇迹。有一位上尉在弥留之际感叹说：“唉，这确实太惨了。”不幸的人啊，这句话里该是包含了多少世间的情感。他边说边痛苦地哼了一声，把脸转向了墙面。

盎格鲁—凯尔特人总是喜欢追求个人主义，但是世上没有别的哪个民族能制定出这么理想主义的纪律，并将之贯彻始终。在罗马和希腊的编年史里，哪怕是庞贝城中即将面临火山岩浆炙烤的哨岗，也无法像随着“伯肯黑德号”运兵船[122]沉入海中的年轻英国士兵那样，庄严地诠释“职责”这个词的含义。格里利这次探险中还发生了一件事，我觉得也一样令人印象深刻。如果你读过这书，也应该记得，当探险队只剩下八个悲惨的幸存者的时候，七个由于饥饿而过度虚弱的人，还把另一个人抬了出去，放在满是冰雪的地上，然后对他执行了枪决，因为他违反了纪律。执行的每一个环节都有签字，好像华盛顿的国会大厦就近在咫尺，能看到他们的行动似的。我记得，这个人犯的罪是偷偷吃掉了绑雪橇的皮绳，那皮绳的味道估计跟鞋带差不多。然而，站在长官的立场上，这是一连串小偷小摸行为的一桩，而且雪橇上的皮绳对整个探险队来说可能事关生死。

就我个人来说，任何跟北冰洋沾边儿的事情都能引起我极大的兴趣。去过那片神秘地域的人，都会在身上留有它的光辉。那是地球上最美好，也是最残酷的地方。曾经，我站在已探明的地界上，用枪射下南飞的野鸭，从它们的砂囊里取出了一些小石子，那些小石子是野鸭在人类尚未踏足的土地上吞进口中的。空气的气息难以用文字形容，冰雪包围的大湖有着深蓝色水面，无云的天空在与地平线交接的地方渐变成浅绿色和微微的黄色；鸟儿叫得叽叽喳喳却很亲人；巨型水生动物的脊背油光锃亮；在冰雪耀眼的白光映衬下，形体像鼻涕虫的海豹看起来是那么黑—所有的回忆都在梦中才会回到人的脑海里，似乎这些记忆不过是美妙的梦境而已，跟生活的主流方向相去甚远。还有，不断拉动钓线使捕到的鱼疲乏的景象也出现在他的脑海中，那鱼有上百吨重，值两千英镑—但是这些事情跟我的书橱有什么关系呢？

可是它们在我的记忆中有一席之地，而且直接带我来到了书架上的下一本书，那就是布伦[123]写的《抹香鲸号历险记》，这本书里满是海洋的神奇和奥秘，不过也有很多人沉入了海中，他们的悲惨命运使得它的魅力有所减损。书里讲了追捕抹香鲸的故事，是远海上的冒险，跟我在格陵兰岛附近做学徒那七个月的探冰之行可完全不同。恐怕这两样现在都已经不存在了，至少去北边捕鱼的活动已经停止了。而且现在只要把管子插进地下就能得到石油，谁还会去海上卖命呢。值得庆幸的是，这位最有阳刚之气的作家记下了水手的生活历程。布伦的文字水平在最好状态下达到了极高的水准。要让我说明他的水准到底有多高，我会拿出他的下一本书—《海之歌》。

比如，读一下这段如何？假如你的耳朵对富有乐感的文字比较敏感的话，就能体会到。这只是一大段精彩描写中的一小部分内容，总体描述了热带地区比较长的一段无风带。

什么东西改变了亮蓝的大海，很不寻常，并且带有腐败的气息。海面不再像透亮的镜子了，它曾反射了绚丽的阳光、柔美的银色月光和无数闪烁的星光，现在却变了。就像是垂死之人脸上那种灰色，一种让五官模糊的色调，一层薄而油腻的“表皮”覆盖了之前还很漂亮的海面。海像是病了，变得污浊并散发着难闻的气味，从海水中升腾起一种有毒的瘴气，有一股腐烂的味道，黏着在鼻腔让味觉麻木，也让其他感觉器官变得迟钝起来。像是受到了奇异力量的牵引，一些诡异的生物从深海浮了上来，逼近海面，它们从自己待惯了的黑暗海底上来，面对陌生的强光，眼睛半开半闭—这些生物行动并不灵活，全身缠着流苏一样的穗子，那些穗子像疯长的野草一样漂荡，有一英寻[124]那么长，水母透明的身体上覆盖着各种颜色的点，看上去像眼睛一样。像虫子一样蠕动的身体由奇妙的物质构成，那奇妙的透明物质好像只要晒到阳光就会融化掉，但是它们却并不会真的融掉。再下面一点，一些巨大的灰色阴影慵懒地游过，并不想被人看到似的，但是也给我们四周那种奇怪而意味不明的气息加入了一种有点熟悉的味道。

读一读描写热带地区宁静状态的整篇文字，或是另一篇《瞭望台上看日出》，读完你不得不承认在我们这个时代，比这两篇更好的描述性文字实在不多。如果要我只选出十几本书收入海洋类文学图书馆，我肯定会给布伦两个位置。其他的书呢？这个嘛，就要看个人口味了。《汤姆·克林格的航海日记》肯定能得一个位置。我希望现在的男孩仍然跟从前的男孩一样，读到这本好书里写的鲨鱼、海盗、移民者等惊心动魄的内容时，仍然能感受到那种兴奋和愉悦。然后是达纳的《两年水手生涯》。我还能给史蒂文森的《打捞船》和《落潮》找个位子。克拉克·罗素的书应该专架陈列，但无论如何，你不能错过他的《格罗夫纳号的沉没》。马里亚特[125]的书，我会选择《海军候补生伊西先生》和《天真的彼得》作为他的代表作。接着会来两本梅尔维尔的“大溪地系列”—《泰皮》和《欧穆》，这两本现在好像已经被彻底遗忘了。还有三本更接近现代读者口味的书，吉卜林的《勇敢的船长》和杰克·伦敦的《海狼》，以及康拉德的《白水仙号上的黑鬼》。有了这些书，假如书上的文字能唤起你的想象，你就可以把书房当作船舱，你的耳朵里仿佛充满波涛起伏、海浪拍岸的声响。当生活变得过于远离自然的时候，我们是多么渴望海浪啊，身体里古老的维京之血又开始不安分起来！我们所有人的体内肯定都流动着这种血液，因为没有一个人的祖先不是坐着海盗船或科拉科尔小艇来到这里的。在美国人的血液里，海浪激起的骚动肯定更加明显。想想吧，生活在这片广阔大陆上的居民，他们的先民都是横渡了三千英里的海洋才到达这里的。然而在美国中部，他们数百万的后代从未见过海。

我刚才提到过《欧穆》和《泰皮》这两本书，讲的是梅尔维尔作为一名水手生活在大溪地当地人中间的事，可惜它们迅速被大家遗忘了。如果有兴趣广泛、富有同情心的评论家能拯救一下这些被遗忘的书，该是多么美好而有趣的事情啊！它们绝对会回报这份恩情！一本评论性的小书挺身而出，为它们重新赢得声誉并吸引了读者的注意力，这件事本身就很有意思，更有趣的是这本书所写的那些内容，它可以作为介绍更多好书的引言。我敢肯定有许多好书，甚至有很多伟大的作品，都一度仓促地被遗忘了。比如说，有多少无名作家的书在出版的时候就被埋没了，那时国家可能发生了大事件，公众的注意力被危机事件吸引了。可能成百上千的书就这么沉寂了，它们中间有没有应该存留下来的书呢？这儿就有一本，一本当代作家的书，作者—斯奈思[126]—当时还不到三十岁，这本书就是《卡文登的布洛克先生》。这本书根本没有加印过。我不敢说它是一部经典—但是我也不会断言说它不是—不过，我确定写这本书的人有潜力写出经典之作。还有福利斯特的《八天》这部小说，现在你根本买不到这本书了，如果你能在图书馆借到，就算是幸运的了。有关印度兵变的话题，没有哪本书能像这本一样让你感到身临其境。还有一本我敢说你都没听说过，就是鲍威尔的《动物事件簿》。它可不是讲述猫儿狗儿趣事的故事集，而是探讨人类身上的动物性的书，这本书由一系列奇异的故事组成。只要你稍有鉴别能力，就能从这本书里感受到全新的风格。这本书在十年前出版，现在几乎没有人知道了。假如在这么小的书架上我都能指出三本这样的书，那么外面该有多少本来该绽放光芒的书被埋没了啊！

让我回到之前的话题，关于旅行的传奇和现代生活中经常见到的英雄主义。我要推荐两本关于科学探险的书，就我所知，它们都极好地展现了传奇性和英雄主义。如果你想让年轻人经受锻炼，首先是让他的思想温柔而坚定，其次是让他对自然界的事物充满热爱和好奇，那么我找不出比这两本更好的选择。一本是达尔文的《小猎犬号科学考察记》。眼光锐利的人应该早就发现，在《物种起源》面世很早以前，凭着这样一本游记类的书就能看出，一个思想超群，具备了各种罕见天赋的人，出现在了世人面前。这个人拥有极为广博的知识，有史以来还没有出现过这样的人。任何事物，无论渺小还是伟大，他都会敏锐地进行观察。有一整页的内容都是在分析一种极小的蜘蛛结的网，下一页则是有关大陆下沉和许多灭绝的动物的证据。他知识渊博，涵盖生物学、地理学、动物学，而且彼此互补佐证。那时他还多么年轻啊—当他在一八三一年登上“小猎犬号”开始环球科学考察的时候才只有二十三岁。这么年轻就积累了如此丰富的知识，真是让人觉得是个奇迹，这就像是看了一个男孩的演奏，他天赋的展现让你感觉他以后一定能成为大师。这位学者身上的另一种品质，可能我们不太容易发现，那就是他对危险的极度蔑视。这一点被隐藏在他谦逊的文字间，你得逐行细读才能发现。他在阿根廷的时候，白人定居点之外的土地上游荡着骑马的印第安人，他们见到白人格杀勿论。但是达尔文骑马从巴伊亚走到了布宜诺斯艾利斯，两地相隔四百英里之远，就连勇敢的高乔人都拒绝与他同行。对他来说，比起新发现的甲虫和未被描述过的昆虫，个人的安危和死亡的威胁都只是小事情。

我要说的第二本书是华莱士[127]的《马来群岛》。达尔文和华莱士在思想方面有着奇妙的相似之处，无论在精神层面还是体力层面，他们都有无畏的勇气，两个人虽然性格温和，但是意志都非常坚定，知识面广，而且思维开阔，对于观察大自然这件事，他们都充满了激情。华莱士突发灵感，想通了物种起源的缘由，于是写信给达尔文向他描述了这个过程。但此时达尔文正要出版一本书来证明同一个命题，为了这本书他已经耗费了二十年的心血。当他读到这封信的时候，他该做何感想啊！但是他没什么好担心的，因为他这本书最热情的拥护者就是华莱士，从某种意义上说，华莱士早就预见了这本书的问世。华莱士在巴布亚的使命之一就是调查天堂鸟的习性和种类，然而，他在那些岛上游历的许多年里，逐渐完整地调查了整个地区的动物群。某本书上的脚注说那时候天堂鸟栖息区域里的居民都是食人族。想想吧，那么多年都跟这些人生活在一起，或是住在他们附近，多可怕！从这里也可以看出科学界的英雄并不亚于宗教界。谁要是年轻时读了这两本书，他的思想和灵魂都会得到锻炼。





第十二章


好了，我们来跟故去的作者进行最后一次对话吧。耐心的朋友，我最后一次请你在绿色的旧沙发上坐得舒服一点，抬头看看上面的橡木书架，请在我对你讲述它们上面的书籍时，尽量忍耐我的啰唆。这是最后一次了！然而，当我看到这一排排书的时候，我没提到其中每十本里就有一本在我心中激起的感激之情，也没讲过当我的视线扫过它们时脑海里浮现的千头万绪，一点也没讲过。也许这样倒好，因为假如一个人把该说的都说完了，那肯定是讲得太多了。

暂时就让我再多说教一会儿吧！我态度这么庄重—但是，可别叫我老学究！—那是因为我看到了那个小角落里放的我精选的书籍，它们构成了我的科学图书馆。我想说的是，如果让我给刚踏上社会的年轻人一点建议，我会建议他每个星期留出一个晚上来阅读科学类的书籍。如果他能坚持，从二十岁开始做起，那到了他三十岁的时候，一定会发现自己的头脑已经得到了非同寻常的“武装”，无论他走在什么样的人生道路上，都会令他受益无穷。我建议读科学类的书，并不是说他应该去读那些老学究的旧书，或是因为研究鳞翅目的细分种类和双子叶植物的分类方法而把自己弄得晕头转向。这些枯燥的细节知识就像是科学这座魔法花园里那些带刺的灌木，如果你在出发散步的时候就一头扎进去，那可真是太傻了。在你探索完了露天的花床和好走的小路之前，一定不要去靠近它们。为此，不要去看那些教科书，大众科学很有魅力，但是那些书可不会吸引你或是培养你的兴趣。你可别想着当那么多学科的专家。你更应该对一般规律有广泛的认识，并且要理解它们之间的联系。只要稍微读一点书，就能让人拥有一些地理知识，这些地理知识足以让人觉得采石场和铁路路堑也很有趣。不多的动物学知识就足以满足你的好奇心，区分出在眼前这盏灯周围飞舞的橘背灯蛾的学名和习性。只需要一点植物学知识，你就能认出散步时在路边看到的每朵花，而当你碰到知识范围之外的东西的时候，也能体会到好奇心带来的兴奋。稍稍读点考古学的书，就能了解那些英国古墓的故事，或者能帮你拼凑出南方草原上散落的罗马人遗迹的大致分布图。了解一些天文学常识，当你仰望天空的时候，就会更专注。你可以将地球的兄弟行星从陌生的星斗中挑出来，它们都和你的星球一样，在同一个星系里运行。由此你可以领略到宇宙运行的秩序、美感和壮丽，这一切都表明在物质世界背后肯定有神的存在。我不明白科学家怎么能是唯物论者，宗派论主义者又怎么能将造物主的能力给局限起来。有画家，才能有画；有雕塑家，雕塑才能出现；有音乐家，才能有音乐；你能找出没有前者就有后者的例子吗？要是你能，那再跟我谈宇宙存在的背后没有一个造物主，或者，随你用什么名称叫他。

这儿还有一本弗拉马里翁[128]的《大气》，非常漂亮，红色和金色的封面，虽然因为年岁太久有点褪色了。这本书有个来历，让我十分珍惜它。在非洲西海岸的时候，一个来自法国的年轻人把这本书给了我，当作治疗的费用，后来他死于热病。看到它就让我想起了在那艘小船的铺位上，那个年轻人脸色土黄，眼睛凸出，悲伤地看着我。可怜的孩子，我想他再也看不到心爱的故乡马赛了！

说起大众科学知识，我觉得塞缪尔·拉宁[129]的书最能激发一个人最初的兴趣，并且让人了解某个学科大致的知识结构。

谁能想到，这些书里看到的这位睿智的学者、儒雅的梦想家，居然也在一家铁路公司蛮有干劲地做着秘书的工作呢？很多科学上成就极高的人，最开始通常都是做着很乏味的日常工作。赫伯特·斯宾塞最初是铁路工程师。华莱士是土地测量师。但是，像拉宁这样一个拥有如此超凡的科学头脑的人，居然继续把生命投入到枯燥的日常工作中，直到年纪很大实在做不动了才停下来，但他的灵魂一直都能接受新鲜观念，头脑依然能吸收最新的知识成果，这真是令人敬佩。读一读他的书吧，会让你成为一个更丰富的人。

跟人聊天时，谈谈最近读的书是非常好的选择。你可能会说这对听众来说有点太难了；但是，如果不想谈话涉及太多隐私，我觉得这要比那些寻常的闲聊好得多。当然了，这需要一点技巧，你要很谨慎。正是因为谈到了拉宁，才把我的思绪引到了这个话题上。我在某次工作餐，或是在某个其他的场合的时候，听到某人说起了索姆河谷的史前遗迹。我知道所有相关的知识，也告诉了他我所知道的。然后，我提到了尤卡坦半岛上的石头庙宇，他很快就接上了这个话题，并且就此话题进行了进一步详述。他提到了古老的秘鲁文明，我对这方面的了解也跟他不相上下。我还引用了对的的喀喀湖的生动描绘，这个他也都知道。他又说起了第四纪人类，我也能一直跟上。我们对彼此拥有如此广博而准确的知识感到震惊，直到我突然想到了为什么会这样。“你在读塞缪尔·拉宁的《人类之起源》！”我大声说道。他确实是在读这本书，碰巧我也在读。我们在给对方浇水呢，而这水都是刚从源头汲来的。

在我的科学书架的顶头处有两本大书，可能现在的一些学究还在争论，觉得不能把它们归入科学门类。这套书就是迈尔斯的《人类的品性》。不管怎么样，我认为这套书可能会在百年之后被认为是一部伟大的开山之作，从它将延伸出一整套科学体系。在这两本书的封面和封底之间，见证了他无与伦比的耐心、勤奋、思考和公正，他博学的头脑能将千万个零散的细节整合起来，用一致性的系统将它们全都收拢在一张网当中。正如达尔文沉迷于动物学研究，总是充满激情地寻找并收集新奇的物种一样，迈尔斯也在人类精神的晦暗领域进行了深入研究。他提出的假说前所未有，以至于需要发明出一套新的命名法和术语来表达，例如超能感应、潜意识，其他的则都有实例可查，并以细致、严谨的文字表述了推导过程，这将一直具有里程碑式的意义。

在文学的任何一个分支中，带一点科学思想和科学方法的作品都有极大的吸引力，不管它们离实际研究有多远。例如，爱伦·坡的故事在很大程度上应归功于此，但是就他的情况来说，那都是幻想罢了。儒勒·凡尔纳娴熟地运用了大量自然界的真实知识描绘各种不可思议的神奇事物，但却让人觉得可信，并且看得欲罢不能。然而，他的作品最优美之处在于其中轻灵的叙述形式，许多有趣的想象场景都是从真实例子出发，引出类比和证明，想象与现实交相呼应，两者的结合给读者带来了一种特别的阅读快感。

温德尔·福尔摩斯[130]不朽的三部曲《独裁者》《诗人》和《早餐桌上的教授》，这三本小小的书最能说明我的观点了。在这几本书里，时常用典故或类比来补充微妙、文雅又细致的见解，显示了作者广博的知识面，准确度也很高。他的作品真是太棒了！他充满了智慧，妙语连珠，心胸宽广，那么宽容！假如我们死后在极乐世界能选择自己喜欢的哲学家讲课，就像古时在雅典那样，我肯定会加入围着这位波士顿贤者的人群当中，听他那充满人性、饱含仁慈的讲演。我想应该是科学一直以来对我潜移默化的影响，尤其是我早年学生时代受到的医学方面的教育，让我一直对这方面的书有如此强烈的兴趣。我从来没有见过温德尔，却觉得从未如此了解和仰慕过一个人。我的人生愿望之一就是希望有一天能见到他本人，但是由于命运的捉弄，当我抵达他所在的城市时，只能在他刚立好的墓碑面前献上一个花圈。你再去读一读他的书，看看有没有被他书里超前的想法深深打动。对我来说，他的作品就像是丁尼生的《悼念集》，它绽放的时间超前了五十年。我们随便翻到一页读一读，其中都不乏精彩的段落，都能说明作者视野宽广，遣词灵活，所用的类比极为幽默，而且相当有启发性，感染力十足。下面就有一个例子，跟许多其他段落一样，结合了所有这些不可多得的优点：

通常，精神病的发生是由于正常大脑超负荷运转。对于运行良好的精神机体而言，如果突然有外力试图让其停止或是反方向运转，不可避免就会折断轮子或杠杆。而对于软弱的精神机制来说，它根本无法聚集足够的力量对自身造成伤害；蠢笨的人常常不会遭受“发疯”的伤害。我们经常会看到有的人由宗教信仰引发精神紊乱被送进精神病院。坦白说，我觉得他们比许多在精神病院之外的人要好，那些人尽管保持了正常的神智，还在尽情地享受生活，但脑子里的想法跟病人一样。任何一个正派人，要是脑子里尽是一些那样的想法，不疯才怪呢……任何野蛮、残忍、粗野的观念，都会让大多数人，甚至所有人的生活陷入绝望。任何认为有必要根除我们易被控制的本能的观念—无论你管它叫什么，无论信它的人是修道士、托钵僧还是教会执事，如果这种观念被接受了，它就会让每一个冷静清醒的头脑变得疯狂。

一位大学教授敢这么说话，真是给沉闷的五十年代[131]带来了一丝辩证法的清风，而且也见证了他本人的道德勇气。

在散文方面，比起兰姆，我更喜欢温德尔的作品，因为我觉得他的文章里有实际知识，而且如实地反映了生活中的问题和事件，在这一点上，兰姆这位精灵般的伦敦人有所欠缺。我并不是说兰姆不具有那种难得的天资。那里有我收藏的《伊利亚随笔集》，你看看那本书就知道我也经常读，所以并不是说我不喜欢兰姆，而更喜欢温德尔。他们都写出了绝妙的作品，但温德尔·福尔摩斯总是能在我心里奏出某种旋律，让我对他产生一种回应的震颤。

散文总是不太讨人喜欢，除非作者的笔调足够灵活，足够娴熟。它也让人想起在学校读书时的课堂练习—给你一个题目，看你能在这个题目下写出什么来。就连我最崇敬的史蒂文森写的散文—就算他的散文里有一些新颖的观点和优雅的措辞—读者读过几篇之后也就很难继续往下读了。虽然散文创作有不可避免的难处，但还是可以做得非常好，他的《人与书》和《少男少女》就是极佳范本。

但是他的文风，真令人遗憾！啊，假如史蒂文森能意识到他自己就拥有天赐的文笔该多好，而且是那么优美而有力，那他就不会煞费苦心地去学用别人的风格写作了！关于这事有一则广受赞誉的传闻，说他如何模仿这位或那位作家，不断变换风格，以期找到最佳的写作方式。读到这事真是太令人伤心了！最自然的才是最好的啊。当史蒂文森有意识地锤炼文风的时候，很多评论家给予了赞扬，但是我觉得这时候的他就像是一个明明天生有好看的鬈发，却非要把一顶假发戴在头上的人一样。当他写得有点做作的时候，就失去了对文章的把控。但是只要他忠于自我，做回那个苏格兰低地的撒克逊人，使用直截了当的词语和精练的短句，那么，我觉得近年来都找不出能与他匹敌的作家。在这种强有力又朴实的背景下，偶尔出现的欢快语句就像是经过切割的宝石。一位真正好的文体家就像是博·布伦美笔下衣着得体的绅士一样—穿得那么考究，旁人无从品评。当你开始注意到一个人的风格的时候，就说明里面有些问题。它就是水晶里的一点瑕疵，把读者的注意力从文本转向了手法，从作者的主题转向了作者本身。

不，我没有爱丁堡的版本。如果你实在想要找出一个代表，我真的不想提什么建议。也许我更希望在零散的书里看他的文字，而不是看他的全套作品。他一半的作品要比很多作家全部作品更优质，而且也代表了他本人不错的水准。我相信那些尊重他的友人肯定得到了授权，并针对如何出版全集给出了建议，而且很可能是在他令人遗憾地离世之前就安排好了。但是，我觉得，通常情况下，一位作者应该经过很好的修剪之后，再让他暴露在时间的风吹雨打中。那些软弱的枝条、不成熟的嫩芽都应该被去掉，只留下强健、茁壮、挺过了风风雨雨的树枝，这样才能让整棵树在未来的岁月里挺拔不倒。如果我们爱读书的孙辈从这整套书里随便拿出一本书，真是太有可能对史蒂文森留下错误印象了！当我们看着他的手在书架上游走的时候，只能祈祷他的手最后能停在我们喜欢的那些书上，《新一千零一夜》《落潮》《打捞船》《绑架》或是《金银岛》都可以。这些书从来没有失去过它们的魅力。

后面这两本书—《绑架》和《金银岛》—真是这个类型中极为优秀的作品。它们都在我下层的书架上闪闪发光呢！《金银岛》讲的故事虽然更精彩一些，但是我认为《绑架》拥有更恒久的价值，因为它生动描绘了查理二世最后一次复辟之后苏格兰高地的情况。两本书里各有一个与众不同、令人敬畏的人物，一本里是艾伦·布瑞克，另一本里是高个儿约翰[132]。当然了，约翰·西尔弗的脸跟火腿一样大，两只小眼睛像两块玻璃碎渣一样在脸中间闪着光，他真是所有海上亡命徒的国王。通过他可以观察作者如何制造出令人印象深刻的效果，作者很少通过叙述者的视角来说什么，而是通过对比，通过影射和间接引语。讨人厌的比利·伯恩斯很害怕一个“只有一条腿的海上恶徒”。小说告诉我们弗林特船长是一个勇敢的人，“他可是谁都不怕，只怕西尔弗—西尔弗就是那么厉害”。或者，还有约翰自己说的：“有的人怕皮尤，有的人怕弗林特，但是弗林特本人很怕我。虽然他怕我，但他也有值得骄傲的地方。弗林特的船员个个能打，是海上最厉害的一群人，就是魔鬼都怕跟他们一起出海。所以，现在，我跟你说吧。我不是个爱吹牛的人，你自己也看到了我跟我的伙计们相处得很好。但是，一旦我掌舵的时候，弗林特都怕的老海盗可就不是小羊羔了。”从各处的描写和暗示中，我们渐渐看到了一个油嘴滑舌、冷酷无情、领导有方的独腿恶魔。对我们来说，他不再是一个被小说家创造出来的虚构人物，而像是我们遇见的现实中活生生的人。作者就是用这样细致而隐晦的笔法将这个人物描绘了出来。还有那帮海盗，作者也只用了简单的几笔就把他们思考和行事方式写了出来，但非常有效。“我是很想进那个房舱，真想；我想要他们的腌菜和红酒什么的。”“听着，如果你真和比尔一起出过海，你是不会站在那里，让人给你讲两遍该做什么，你肯定不会。那绝对不是比尔的风格，也不是跟他一起出过海的人会干的事。”司各特在《海盗》一书里写的那些海盗令人叹服，但是缺少一点人情味，而我们在这本书里能找到它。约翰·西尔弗这个人物在关于海洋的小说中会一直占有一席之地，“这一点绝对不错”。

史蒂文森深受梅瑞狄斯的影响，在《绑架》和《金银岛》这两本书里也可以看出这位大师的影响。史蒂文森有时候会用一个古体词或是很不常用的词语，他描写的文字通常很短、很有力，用的比喻非同寻常，他的人物说话也大都很短促。不过，尽管他们有这些相似点，但他们的个人风格还是很明显的，足以自成一派。他们的不足，或者说他们的局限，从来不在行文中体现，而是在他们最初的观念里体现。他们只刻画生活的某一个方面，而且是非常奇怪、不同寻常的一面。书里没什么跟女性相关的内容，这让我们觉得简直就是“男孩小说”的巅峰—我们小时候爱看的一便士一本的侦探小说的大集合。但是故事都很好看，新奇而生动，所以尽管它的视野有局限，仍然稳固地在文学史上占据着一席之地。《鲁滨逊漂流记》对十九世纪的年轻一代产生了重大影响，《金银岛》完全可以对二十一世纪的年轻一代产生相同影响。局面完全在向那个方向发展。

现代的那些男性主义小说，通常都只描写生活中艰辛而动荡的部分，只关注客观的部分而不管主观的部分。这标志着对之前的小说滥用爱情主题的旧观念的抗拒。以正统的视角来写人生的这个阶段，然后以传统的婚姻结束，这简直已经成了陈词滥调，让人厌烦，所以可以理解有时候作家会走向另一个极端，在他们笔下，这件事在男人生活中并没有得到应有的重视。英国的小说，十本里有九本都是把婚姻当成生命中的圆满和结束。但是我们知道，在现实生活中，真相并非如此。对于一个普通人来说，婚姻不过是他人生中的一件事而已，当然，很重要；但是，也只是许多重大事件中的一件。他会被许多强烈的情感左右；他的事业，他的野心，他的友情，还有那些不断出现的危险和苦难，这些都会削弱人的智慧和勇气，他要与之搏斗。通常，爱情只能在他生活中扮演一个次要的角色。这世上有多少人根本没有体会过爱情就过完了一生？而爱情被这么频繁地当成生命中首要且最重要的事情，真是让人反感；所以，毫不奇怪，有的流派就完全避开了与之相关的内容，因为这个话题已经被太多人滥用，史蒂文森当然就是这个流派的领袖。如果所有爱情故事都像理查德·法弗尔和露西·德斯伯勒之间的那么动人，我们看再多也不够；但要让激情焕发新生，就需要有勇气打破陈规的文学大师，从真实的生活中找寻灵感。

新颖而有趣的用词是史蒂文森最显著的创作手法。没人能像他那样匠心独具又十分准确地使用形容词。他的书里，随便翻到哪一页，都能看到让我们觉得新奇的词语和句子，而且还精确地传达了要表达的意思。“他的眼神溜到了我身上。”要是想引证他书中这样的例子可就危险了，因为这样的例子根本举不完，想到一个就会联系到另一个。有时候他也会用词不够精确，但是这种情况极少。比如说，用“目光射出”来替代“瞥一眼”就并不是很好，还有用“嘻嘻窃笑”换掉“咯咯笑个不停”也会听起来刺耳，虽然这些表述可能引用自乔叟[133]的著作。

其次是他有惊人的才能，能写出简练的明喻，抓住了读者的注意力，也激发了他们的想象力。“他的嗓音有些沙哑，局促不安，就像是一把生锈的锁。”“我看到她浑身颤抖，像是遭受了狂风的侵袭。”“他的笑声听起来都假惺惺的，像破铃铛一样。”“他说话的声音就像是拉紧的绳子。”“我脑子转得飞快，像织工手里的梭子一样。”“他喘气的声音回荡在坟墓上，声音粗得像在哭。”“当那个人说话的时候，我心中的愧疚感就像山上的小兔子一样不断冒出头来。”这些比喻直接而朴实，真是太精彩了。

要知道，不管怎样，史蒂文森的主要特点在于他有一种奇特的能力，能以最少的用词在读者脑海里留下深刻的印象。他能让你清楚地看到某个场景，可能比你亲眼所见的还要更真实一些。下面就有几个他描绘的画面，我随意找的，还有其他成百上千个这样的好例子：

不远处，麦克诺基站在那儿，舌头伸了出来，一只手放在下巴上，像是一个很笨的人在努力想什么事。

斯图尔特在我们身后追了一英里多，最后当我转过身看到他在一座小山上，忍不住笑了出来，他一只手叉在腰上，跑得快炸了。

巴伦特雷转头看向了我，脸上满是皱纹，牙齿全露了出来……他一个字也没说，但是他整个表情就是一个可怕的问题。

如果你不信，就看看他吧；看他那副样子，嬉皮笑脸，吃东西狼吞虎咽，仔细看绝对是个贼。

他用一种好战的眼神仔细打量着我，我可以看到他嘴角发出的挑衅。

看看这些句子，还能有什么能比它们制造出的效果更生动？

史蒂文森的小说创作手法奇特而新颖，这一点还有很多可说。有一个不太重要的方面，也可以提一下，那就是他创作了一类坏人，我们可以称其为身体残缺的坏蛋。确实，威尔基·柯林斯先生[134]也曾描写过一位绅士，他不仅失去了四肢，而且还遭受着马瑟瑞姆斯·德克斯特[135]带来的难以忍受的痛苦。但是史蒂文森却频繁使用这种写作手法，并且制造出了强有力的效果，可以说是将其变成了独家技巧。海德就不必说了，他本身就是身体畸形的化身，还有可怕的瞎子皮尤，少了两根手指的黑狗，只剩下一条腿的高个儿约翰，阴险的传道士虽然眼瞎了，但是可以靠耳朵辨音来射击，而且还会用他的手杖打人。还有在《黑箭》里也有一个很可怕的人，走路的时候会用拐杖敲打地面。虽然这个技巧他运用得很频繁，但是他手法高超，一直都能达到预期的效果。

史蒂文森的作品能算经典吗？经典是个很具权威性的词。能进入一个国家永恒作品库的作品才能成为经典。一般来说，我们知道的经典，它们的作者都早已进入了坟墓。谁能猜到爱伦·坡和博罗的作品能够列入经典呢？罗马天主教要在圣徒死去一百年之后才会对他们进行正式册封，经典作品也是如此。选择权就在我们的孙辈手中。但是我觉得活泼健康的男孩们是不会让史蒂文森的探险小说消亡的，像《沙汀上的孤阁》这样的短篇故事，还有《化身博士》这么精彩的寓言故事，我想永远都会有人对它们表示尊敬。我还清楚地记得在十九世纪七十年代末、八十年代初在《康西尔》杂志上看到这些故事的时候，心里的那种急切和欢喜。因为沿袭了老派且不公平的传统，那时候作者没有署名，但是这些故事一看就是出自同一个作者，稍对文字有感觉的人都绝对不会看错。多年之后我才知道它们的作者到底是谁。

在那边的小书橱里，我还有史蒂文森的诗集。他给我们创造了这么多的作品呢！大多数诗歌都是他异想天开写下的一些有趣的俏皮话。但是有一首诗绝对可以列入经典，就我的判断，它无论如何也算得上十九世纪最优秀的叙事民谣，因为我没记错的话，《古舟子吟》面世于十八世纪末。柯勒律治充满阴郁幻想的大作可以排在第一位，不过就我所知，无论是论诗歌的魅力，还是雕琢词句的手法，还是从容的气场，都没有哪首诗能比得上《提康德罗加》。另外，还有他不朽的墓志铭。仅是这两首作品，就足够为他在我们的诗歌文学史上赢得一席之地，而他的品格也赢得了我们发自内心的崇敬。确实，我从没亲眼见过他。但我有几封来自萨摩亚群岛的信，它们都是我最珍视的物件。在那座遥远的高塔之上，他仍然密切关注着写作圈的动态，令人感到意外。他总会在第一时间去拉一把那些正在写作道路上奋斗的新手，因为他拥有敏锐的鉴赏眼光和热切的同理心，就算只读到别人写的一半故事，也能在他自己的脑海中为它赋予美感。

好了，我耐心的朋友，现在到我们告别的时候了，希望你不会觉得这些说教文章太无聊。如果我给你带来了某些你以前不知道的信息，请去查证，然后继续探索。要是没有你不知道的，那也没什么害处，只是浪费了我的口舌和你的时间。在我说过的内容之中，可能有一堆错误，不过，健谈的人说错点话，这难道不是一项特权吗？我的看法可能跟你的看法大相径庭，我喜欢的东西可能你会非常讨厌；但是，不管结果如何，光是想想书、谈谈书，这本身就让人非常快乐了。现在，魔法门仍然还是关着的。但是，哎呀，虽然你能关上那扇门，你却没办法把它完全封住，仍然会传来门铃声，会有电话来找你，召唤你回到那个丑恶的世界，面对工作、同事和生活的各种纷扰。好吧，毕竟那才是真实的生活—在这里的只是假想。不过，就算现在门敞开了，我们一起走了出去，有了在魔法门内休息的安静时光和结识的良师益友，在面对命运的时候，我们心中难道不多了一份勇气吗？





I


I care not how humble your bookshelf may be,nor how lowly the room which it adorns.Close the door of that room behind you,shut off with it all the cares of the outer world,plunge back into the soothing company of the great dead,and then you are through the magic portal into that fair land whither worry and vexation can follow you no more.You have left all that is vulgar and all that is sordid behind you.There stand your noble,silent comrades,waiting in their ranks.Pass your eye down their files.Choose your man.And then you have but to hold up your hand to him and away you go together into dreamland.Surely there would be something eerie about a line of books were it not that familiarity has deadened our sense of it.Each is a mummified soul embalmed in cerecloth and natron of leather and printer's ink.Each cover of a true book enfolds the concentrated essence of a man.The personalities of the writers have faded into the thinnest shadows,as their bodies into impalpable dust,yet here are their very spirits at your command.

It is our familiarity also which has lessened our perception of the miraculous good fortune which we enjoy.Let us suppose that we were suddenly to learn that Shakespeare had returned to earth,and that he would favor any of us with an hour of his wit and his fancy.How eagerly we would seek him out！And yet we have him—the very best of him—at our elbows from week to week,and hardly trouble ourselves to put out our hands to beckon him down.

No matter what mood a man may be in,when once he has passed through the magic door he can summon the world's greatest to sympathize with him in it.If he be thoughtful,here are the kings of thought.If he be dreamy,here are the masters of fancy.Or is it amusement that he lacks?He can signal to any one of the world's great story-tellers,and out comes the dead man and holds him enthralled by the hour.The dead are such good company that one may come to think too little of the living.It is a real and a pressing danger with many of us,that we should never find our own thoughts and our own souls,but be ever obsessed by the dead.Yet second-hand romance and second-hand emotion are surely better than the dull soul-killing monotony which life brings to most of the human race.But best of all when the dead man's wisdom and the dead man's example give us guidance and strength in the living of our own strenuous days.

Come through the magic door with me,and sit here on the green settee,where you can see the old oak case with its untidy lines of volumes.Smoking is not forbidden.Would you care to hear me talk of them?Well,I ask nothing better,for there is no volume there which is not a dear,personal friend,and what can a man talk of more pleasantly than that?The other books are over yonder,but these are my own favorites—the ones I care to re-read and to have near my elbow.There is not a tattered cover which does not bring its mellow memories to me.

Some of them represent those little sacrifices which make a possession dearer.You see the line of old,brown volumes at the bottom?Every one of those represents a lunch.They were bought in my student days,when times were not too affluent.Three-pence was my modest allowance for my midday sandwich and glass of beer；but,as luck would have it,my way to the classes led past the most fascinating bookshop in the world.Outside the door of it stood a large tub filled with an ever-changing litter of tattered books,with a card above which announced that any volume therein could be purchased for the identical sum which I carried in my pocket.As I approached it a combat ever raged betwixt the hunger of a youthful body and that of an inquiring and omnivorous mind.Five times out of six the animal won.But when the mental prevailed,then there was an entrancing five minutes'digging among out-of-date almanacs,volumes of Scotch theology,and tables of logarithms,until one found something which made it all worthwhile.If you will look over these titles,you will see that I did not do so very badly.Four volumes of Gordon's“Tacitus”（life is too short to read originals so long as there are good translations），Sir William Temple's Essays,Addison's works,Swift's“Tale of a Tub，”Clarendon’s“History，”“Gil Bias，”Buckingham’s Poems,Churchill’s Poems，“Life of Bacon”—not so bad for the old threepenny tub.

They were not always in such plebeian company.Look at the thickness of the rich leather,and the richness of the dim gold lettering.Once they adorned the shelves of some noble library,and even among the odd almanacs and the sermons they bore the traces of their former greatness,like the faded silk dress of the reduced gentlewoman,a present pathos but a glory of the past.

Reading is made too easy nowadays,with cheap paper editions and free libraries.A man does not appreciate at its full worth the thing that comes to him without effort.Who now ever gets the thrill which Carlyle felt when he hurried home with the six volumes of Gibbon's“History”under his arm,his mind just starving for want of food,to devour them at the rate of one a day?A book should be your very own before you can really get the taste of it,and unless you have worked for it,you will never have the true inward pride of possession.

If I had to choose the one book out of all that line from which I have had most pleasure and most profit,I should point to yonder stained copy of Macaulay's“Essays.”It seems entwined into my whole life as I look backwards.It was my comrade in my student days,it has been with me on the sweltering Gold Coast,and it formed part of my humble kit when I went a-whaling in the Arctic.Honest Scotch harpooners have addled their brains over it,and you may still see the grease stains where the second engineer grappled with Frederick the Great.Tattered and dirty and worn,no gilt-edged morocco-bound volume could ever take its place for me.

What a noble gateway this book forms through which one may approach the study either of letters or of history！Milton,Machiavelli,Hallam,Southey,Bunyan,Byron,Johnson,Pitt,Hampden,Clive,Hastings,Chatham—what nuclei for thought！With a good grip of each how pleasant and easy to fill in all that lies between.The short,vivid sentences,the broad sweep of allusion,the exact detail,they all throw a glamour round the subject and should make the least studious of readers desire to go further.If Macaulay's hand cannot lead a man upon those pleasant paths,then,indeed,he may give up all hope of ever finding them.

When I was a senior schoolboy this book—not this very volume,for it had an even more tattered predecessor—opened up a new world to me.History had been a lesson and abhorrent.Suddenly the task and the drudgery became an incursion into an enchanted land,a land of color and beauty,with a kind,wise guide to point the path.In that great style of his I loved even the faults—indeed,now that I come to think of it,it was the faults which I loved best.No sentence could be too stiff with rich embroidery,and no antithesis too flowery.It pleased me to read that“a universal shout of laughter from the Tagus to the Vistula informed the Pope that the days of the crusades were past，”and I was delighted to learn that“Lady Jerningham kept a vase in which people placed foolish verses,and Mr.Dash wrote verses which were fit to be placed in Lady Jerningham's vase.”Those were the kind of sentences which used to fill me with a vague but enduring pleasure,like chords which linger in the musician's ear.A man likes a plainer literary diet as he grows older,but still as I glance over the Essays I am filled with admiration,and wonder at the alternate power of handling a great subject,and of adorning it by delightful detail—just a bold sweep of the brush and then the most delicate stippling.As he leads you down the path,he for ever indicates the alluring sidetracks which branch away from it.An admirable,if somewhat old-fashioned,literary and historical education might be effected by working through every book which is alluded to in the Essays.I should be curious,however,to know the exact age of the youth when he came to the end of his studies.

I wish Macaulay had written a historical novel.I am convinced that it would have been a great one.I do not know if he had the power of drawing an imaginary character,but he certainly had the gift of reconstructing a dead celebrity to a remarkable degree.Look at the simple half-paragraph in which he gives us Johnson and his atmosphere.Was ever a more definite picture given in a shorter space—

As we close it,the club-room is before us,and the table on which stand the omelet for Nugent,and the lemons for Johnson.There are assembled those heads which live for ever on the canvas of Reynolds.There are the spectacles of Burke,and the tall thin form of Langton,the courtly sneer of Beauclerk and the beaming smile of Garrick,Gibbon tapping his snuff-box,and Sir Joshua with his trumpet in his ear.In the foreground is that strange figure which is as familiar to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought up—the gigantic body,the huge massy face,seamed with the scars of disease,the brown coat,the black worsted stockings,the gray wig with the scorched foretop,the dirty hands,the nails bitten and pared to the quick.We see the eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches；we see the heavy form rolling；we hear it puffing,and then comes the“Why,sir！”and the“What then,sir?”and the“No,sir！”and the“You don’t see your way through the question,sir！”

It is etched into your memory for ever.

I can remember that when I visited London at the age of sixteen the first thing I did after housing my luggage was to make a pilgrimage to Macaulay's grave where he lies in Westminster Abbey,just under the shadow of Addison,and amid the dust of the poets whom he had loved so well.It was the one great object of interest which London held for me.And so it might well be,when I think of all I owe him.It is not merely the knowledge and the stimulation of fresh interests,but it is the charming gentlemanly tone,the broad,liberal outlook,the general absence of bigotry and of prejudice.My judgment now confirms all that I felt for him then.

My four-volume edition of the History stands,as you see,to the right of the Essays.Do you recollect the third chapter of that work—the one which reconstructs the England of the seventeenth century?It has always seemed to me the very high-water mark of Macaulay's powers,with its marvelous mixture of precise fact and romantic phrasing.The population of towns,the statistics of commerce,the prosaic facts of life are all transmuted into wonder and interest by the handling of the master.You feel that he could have cast a glamour over the multiplication table had he set himself to do so.Take a single concrete example of what I mean.The fact that a Londoner in the country,or a countryman in London,felt equally out of place in those days of difficult travel,would seem to hardly require stating,and to afford no opportunity of leaving a strong impression upon the reader's mind.See what Macaulay makes of it,though it is no more than a hundred other paragraphs which discuss a hundred various points—

A cockney in a rural village,was stared at as much as if he had intruded into a kraal of Hottentots.On the other hand,when the lord of a Lincolnshire or Shropshire manor appeared in Fleet Street,he was as easily distinguished from the resident population as a Turk or a Lascar.His dress,his gait,his accent,the manner in which he gazed at the shops,stumbled into gutters,ran against the porters,and stood under the waterspouts,marked him out as an excellent subject for the operations of swindlers and banterers.Bullies jostled him into the kennel.Hackney coachmen splashed him from head to foot,thieves explored with perfect security the huge pockets of his horseman’s coat,while he stood entranced by the splendor of the Lord Mayor’s Show.Money-droppers,sore from the cart’s tail,introduced themselves to him,and appeared to him the most honest friendly gentlemen that he had ever seen.Painted women,the refuse of Lewkner Lane and Whetstone

Park,passed themselves on him for countesses and maids of honor.If he asked his way to St.James’，his informants sent him to Mile End.If he went into a shop,he was instantly discerned to be a fit purchaser of everything that nobody else would buy,of second-hand embroidery,copper rings,and watches that would not go.If he rambled into any fashionable coffee-house,he became a mark for the insolent derision of fops,and the grave waggery of Templars.Enraged and mortified,he soon returned to his mansion,and there,in the homage of his tenants and the conversation of his boon companions,found consolation for the vexations and humiliations which he had undergone.There he was once more a great man,and saw nothing above himself except when at the assizes he took his seat on the bench near the Judge,or when at the muster of the militia he saluted the Lord Lieutenant.

On the whole,I should put this detached chapter of description at the very head of his Essays,though it happens to occur in another volume.The History as a whole does not,as it seems to me,reach the same level as the shorter articles.One cannot but feel that it is a brilliant piece of special pleading from a fervid Whig,and that there must be more to be said for the other side than is there set forth.Some of the Essays are tinged also,no doubt,by his own political and religious limitations.The best are those which get right away into the broad fields of literature and philosophy.Johnson,Walpole,Madame D'Arblay,Addison,and the two great Indian ones,Clive and Warren Hastings,are my own favorites.Frederick the Great too,must surely stand in the first rank.Only one would I wish to eliminate.It is the diabolically clever criticism upon Montgomery.One would have wished to think that Macaulay's heart was too kind,and his soul too gentle,to pen so bitter an attack.Bad work will sink of its own weight.It is not necessary to souse the author as well.One would think more highly of the man if he had not done that savage bit of work.

I don't know why talking of Macaulay always makes me think of Scott,whose books,in a faded,olive-backed line,have a shelf,you see,of their own.Perhaps it is that they both had so great an influence,and woke such admiration in me.Or perhaps it is the real similarity in the minds and characters of the two men.You don't see it,you say?Well,just think of Scott's“Border Ballads，”and then of Macaulay's“Lays.”The machines must be alike,when the products are so similar.Each was the only man who could possibly have written the poems of the other.What swing and dash in both of them！What a love of all that is manly and noble and martial！So simple,and yet so strong.But there are minds on which strength and simplicity are thrown away.They think that unless a thing is obscure it must be superficial,whereas it is often the shallow stream which is turbid,and the deep which is clear.Do you remember the fatuous criticism of Matthew Arnold upon the glorious“Lays，”where he calls out“Is this poetry?”after quoting—

And how can man die better

Than facing fearful odds，

For the ashes of his fathers，

And the Temples of his Gods?

In trying to show that Macaulay had not the poetic sense he was really showing that he himself had not the dramatic sense.The baldness of the idea and of the language had evidently offended him.But this is exactly where the true merit lies.Macaulay is giving the rough,blunt words with which a simpleminded soldier appeals to two comrades to help him in a deed of valor.Any high-flown sentiment would have been absolutely out of character.The lines are,I think,taken with their context,admirable ballad poetry,and have just the dramatic quality and sense which a ballad poet must have.That opinion of Arnold's shook my faith in his judgment,and yet I would forgive a good deal to the man who wrote—

One more charge and then be dumb，

When the forts of Folly fall，

May the victors when they come，

Find my body near the wall.

Not a bad verse that for one's life aspiration.

This is one of the things which human society has not yet understood—the value of a noble,inspiriting text.When it does we shall meet them everywhere engraved on appropriate places,and our progress through the streets will be brightened and ennobled by one continual series of beautiful mental impulses and images,reflected into our souls from the printed thoughts which meet our eyes.To think that we should walk with empty,listless minds while all this splendid material is running to waste.I do not mean mere Scriptural texts,for they do not bear the same meaning to all,though what human creature can fail to be spurred onwards by“Work while it is day,for the night cometh when no man can work.”But I mean those beautiful thoughts—who can say that they are uninspired thoughts?—which may be gathered from a hundred authors to match a hundred uses.A fine thought in fine language is a most precious jewel,and should not be hid away,but be exposed for use and ornament.To take the nearest example,there is a horse-trough across the road from my house,a plain stone trough,and no man could pass it with any feelings save vague discontent at its ugliness.But suppose that on its front slab you print the verse of Coleridge—

He prayeth best who loveth best

All things,both great and small，

For the dear Lord who fashioned him

He knows and loveth all.

I fear I may misquote,for I have not“The Ancient Mariner”at my elbow,but even as it stands does it not elevate the horse-trough?We all do this,I suppose,in a small way for ourselves.There are few men who have not some chosen quotations printed on their study mantelpieces,or,better still,in their hearts.Carlyle's transcription of“Rest！Rest！Shall I not have all Eternity to rest in！”is a pretty good spur to a weary man.But what we need is a more general application of the same thing for public and not for private use,until people understand that a graven thought is as beautiful an ornament as any graven image,striking through the eye right deep down into the soul.

However,all this has nothing to do with Macaulay's glorious lays,save that when you want some flowers of manliness and patriotism you can pluck quite a bouquet out of those.I had the good fortune to learn the Lay of Horatius off by heart when I was a child,and it stamped itself on my plastic mind,so that even now I can reel off almost the whole of it.Goldsmith said that in conversation he was like the man who had a thousand pounds in the bank,but could not compete with the man who had an actual sixpence in his pocket.So the ballad that you bear in your mind outweighs the whole bookshelf which waits for reference.But I want you now to move your eye a little farther down the shelf to the line of olive-green volumes.That is my edition of Scott.But surely I must give you a little breathing space before I venture upon them.





II


It is a great thing to start life with a small number of really good books which are your very own.You may not appreciate them at first.You may pine for your novel of crude and unadulterated adventure.You may,and will,give it the preference when you can.But the dull days come,and the rainy days come,and always you are driven to fill up the chinks of your reading with the worthy books which wait so patiently for your notice.And then suddenly,on a day which marks an epoch in your life,you understand the difference.You see,like a flash,how the one stands for nothing and the other for literature.From that day onwards you may return to your crudities,but at least you do so with some standard of comparison in your mind.You can never be the same as you were before.Then gradually the good thing becomes more dear to you；it builds itself up with your growing mind；it becomes a part of your better self,and so,at last,you can look,as I do now,at the old covers and love them for all that they have meant in the past.Yes,it was the olive-green line of Scott's novels which started me on to rhapsody.They were the first books I ever owned—long,long before I could appreciate or even understand them.But at last I realized what a treasure they were.In my boyhood I read them by surreptitious candle-ends in the dead of the night,when the sense of crime added a new zest to the story.Perhaps you have observed that my“Ivanhoe”is of a different edition from the others.The first copy was left in the grass by the side of a stream,fell into the water,and was eventually picked up three days later,swollen and decomposed,upon a mud-bank.I think I may say,however,that I had worn it out before I lost it.Indeed,it was perhaps as well that it was some years before it was replaced,for my instinct was always to read it again instead of breaking fresh ground.

I remember the late James Payn telling the anecdote that he and two literary friends agreed to write down what scene in fiction they thought the most dramatic,and that on examining the papers it was found that all three had chosen the same.It was the moment when the unknown knight,at Ashby-de-la-Zouch,riding past the pavilions of the lesser men,strikes with the sharp end of his lance,in a challenge to mortal combat,the shield of the formidable Templar.It was,indeed,a splendid moment！What matter that no Templar was allowed by the rules of his Order to take part in so secular and frivolous an affair as a tournament?It is the privilege of great masters to make things so,and it is a churlish thing to gainsay it.Was it not Wendell Holmes who described the prosaic man,who enters a drawing-room with a couple of facts,like ill-conditioned bull-dogs at his heels,ready to let them loose on any play of fancy?The great writer can never go wrong.If Shakespeare gives a sea-coast to Bohemia,or if Victor Hugo calls an English prize-fighter Mr.Jim-John-Jack—well,it was so,and that's an end of it.“There is no second line of rails at that point，”said an editor to a minor author.“I make a second line，”said the author；and he was within his rights,if he can carry his readers'conviction with him.

But this is a digression from“Ivanhoe.”What a book it is！The second greatest historical novel in our language,I think.Every successive reading has deepened my admiration for it.Scott's soldiers are always as good as his women（with exceptions）are weak；but here,while the soldiers are at their very best,the romantic figure of Rebecca redeems the female side of the story from the usual commonplace routine.Scott drew manly men because he was a manly man himself,and found the task a sympathetic one.

He drew young heroines because a convention demanded it,which he had never the hardihood to break.It is only when we get him for a dozen chapters on end with a minimum of petticoat—in the long stretch,for example,from the beginning of the Tournament to the end of the Friar Tuck incident—that we realize the height of continued romantic narrative to which he could attain.I don't think in the whole range of our literature we have a finer sustained flight than that.

There is,I admit,an intolerable amount of redundant verbiage in Scott's novels.Those endless and unnecessary introductions make the shell very thick before you come to the oyster.They are often admirable in themselves,learned,witty,picturesque,but with no relation or proportion to the story which they are supposed to introduce.Like so much of our English fiction,they are very good matter in a very bad place.Digression and want of method and order are traditional national sins.Fancy introducing an essay on how to live on nothing a year as Thackeray did in“Vanity Fair，”or sandwiching in a ghost story as Dickens has dared to do.As well might a dramatic author rush up to the footlights and begin telling anecdotes while his play was suspending its action and his characters waiting wearily behind him.It is all wrong,though every great name can be quoted in support of it.Our sense of form is lamentably lacking,and Sir Walter sinned with the rest.But get past all that to a crisis in the real story,and who finds the terse phrase,the short fire-word,so surely as he?Do you remember when the reckless Sergeant of Dragoons stands at last before the grim Puritan,upon whose head a price has been set：“A thousand marks or a bed of heather！”says he,as he draws.The Puritan draws also：“The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon！”says he.No verbiage there！But the very spirit of either man and of either party,in the few stern words,which haunt your mind.“Bows and Bills！”cry the Saxon Varangians,as the Moslem horse charges home.You feel it is just what they must have cried.Even more terse and businesslike was the actual battle-cry of the fathers of the same men on that long-drawn day when they fought under the“Red Dragon of Wessex”on the low ridge at Hastings.“Out！Out！”they roared,as the Norman chivalry broke upon them.Terse,strong,prosaic—the very genius of the race was in the cry.

Is it that the higher emotions are not there?Or is it that they are damped down and covered over as too precious to be exhibited?Something of each,perhaps.I once met the widow of the man who,as a young signal midshipman,had taken Nelson's famous message from the Signal Yeoman and communicated it to the ship's company.The officers were impressed.The men were not.“Duty！”they muttered.“We've always done it.Why not?”Anything in the least high-falutin'would depress,not exalt,a British company.It is the understatement which delights them.German troops can march to battle singing Luther's hymns.Frenchmen will work themselves into a frenzy by a song of glory and of Fatherland.Our martial poets need not trouble to imitate—or at least need not imagine that if they do so they will ever supply a want to the British soldier.Our sailors working the heavy guns in South Africa sang：“Here’s another lump of sugar for the Bird.”I saw a regiment go into action to the refrain of“A little bit off the top.”The martial poet aforesaid,unless he had the genius and the insight of a Kipling,would have wasted a good deal of ink before he had got down to such chants as these.The Russians are not unlike us in this respect.I remember reading of some column ascending a breach and singing lustily from start to finish,until a few survivors were left victorious upon the crest with the song still going.A spectator inquired what wondrous chant it was which had warmed them to such a deed of valor,and he found that the exact meaning of the words,endlessly repeated,was“Ivan is in the garden picking cabbages.”The fact is,I suppose,that a mere monotonous sound may take the place of the tom-tom of savage warfare,and hypnotize the soldier into valor.

Our cousins across the Atlantic have the same blending of the comic with their most serious work.Take the songs which they sang during the most bloody war which the Anglo-Celtic race has ever waged—the only war in which it could have been said that they were stretched to their uttermost and showed their true form—“Tramp,tramp,tramp，”“John Brown's Body，”“Marching through Georgia”—all had a playful humor running through them.Only one exception do I know,and that is the most tremendous war-song I can recall.Even an outsider in time of peace can hardly read it without emotion.I mean,of course,Julia Ward Howe's“War-Song of the Republic，”with the choral opening line：“Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.”If that were ever sung upon a battlefield the effect must have been terrific.

A long digression,is it not?But that is the worst of the thoughts at the other side of the Magic Door.You can't pull one out without a dozen being entangled with it.But it was Scott's soldiers that I was talking of,and I was saying that there is nothing theatrical,no posing,no heroics（the thing of all others which the hero abominates），but just the short bluff word and the simple manly ways,with every expression and metaphor drawn from within his natural range of thought.What a pity it is that he,with his keen appreciation of the soldier,gave us so little of those soldiers who were his own contemporaries—the finest,perhaps,that the world has ever seen.It is true that he wrote a life of the great Soldier Emperor,but that was the one piece of hackwork of his career.How could a Tory patriot,whose whole training had been to look upon Napoleon as a malignant Demon,do justice to such a theme?But the Europe of those days was full of material which he of all men could have drawn with a sympathetic hand.What would we not give for a portrait of one of Murat's light-cavalrymen or of a Grenadier of the Old Guard,drawn with the same bold strokes as the Rittmeister of Gustavus or the archers of the French King's Guard in“Quentin Durward”?

In his visit to Paris Scott must have seen many of those iron men who during the preceding twenty years had been the scourge and also the redemption of Europe.To us the soldiers who scowled at him from the sidewalks in 1814 would have been as interesting and as much romantic figures of the past as the mail-clad knights or ruffling cavaliers of his novels.A picture from the life of a Peninsular veteran,with his views upon the Duke,would be as striking as Dugald Dalgetty from the German wars.But then no man ever does realize the true interest of the age in which he happens to live.All sense of proportion is lost,and the little thing hard-by obscures the great thing at a distance.It is easy in the dark to confuse the fire-fly and the star.Fancy,for example,the Old Masters seeking their subjects in inn parlors,or St.Sebastians,while Columbus was discovering America before their very faces.

I have said that I think“Ivanhoe”the best of Scott's novels.I suppose most people would subscribe to that.But how about the second best?It speaks well for their general average that there is hardly one among them which might not find some admirers who would vote it to a place of honor.To the Scottish-born man those novels which deal with Scottish life and character have a quality of raciness which gives them a place apart.There is a rich humor of the soil in such books as“Old Mortality，”“The Antiquary，”and“Rob Roy，”which puts them in a different class from the others.His old Scottish women are,next to his soldiers,the best series of types that he has drawn.At the same time it must be admitted that merit which is associated with dialect has such limitations that it can never take the same place as work which makes an equal appeal to all the world.On the whole,perhaps，“Quentin Durward，”on account of its wider interests,its strong character-drawing,and the European importance of the events and people described,would have my vote for the second place.It is the father of all those sword-and-cape novels which have formed so numerous an addition to the light literature of the last century.The pictures of Charles the Bold and of the unspeakable Louis are extraordinarily vivid.I can see those two deadly enemies watching the hounds chasing the herald,and clinging to each other in the convulsions of their cruel mirth,more clearly than most things which my eyes have actually rested upon.

The portrait of Louis with his astuteness,his cruelty,his superstition and his cowardice is followed closely from Comines,and is the more effective when set up against his bluff and warlike rival.It is not often that historical characters work out in their actual physique exactly as one would picture them to be,but in the High Church of Innsbruck I have seen effigies of Louis and Charles which might have walked from the very pages of Scott—Louis,thin,ascetic,varminty；and Charles with the head of a prize fighter.It is hard on us when a portrait upsets all our preconceived ideas,when,for example,we see in the National Portrait Gallery a man with a noble,olive-tinted,poetic face,and with a start read beneath it that it is the wicked Judge Jeffreys.Occasionally,however,as at Innsbruck,we are absolutely satisfied.I have before me on the mantelpiece yonder a portrait of a painting which represents Queen Mary's Bothwell.Take it down and look at it.Mark the big head,fit to conceive large schemes；the strong animal face,made to captivate a sensitive,feminine woman；the brutally forceful features—the mouth with a suggestion of wild boars'tusks behind it,the beard which could bristle with fury：the whole man and his life-history are revealed in that picture.I wonder if Scott had ever seen the original which hangs at the Hepburn family seat?

Personally,I have always had a very high opinion of a novel which the critics have used somewhat harshly,and which came almost the last from his tired pen.I mean“Count Robert of Paris.”I am convinced that if it had been the first,instead of the last,of the series it would have attracted as much attention as“Waverley.”I can understand the state of mind of the expert,who cried out in mingled admiration and despair：“I have studied the conditions of Byzantine Society all my life,and here comes a Scotch lawyer who makes the whole thing clear to me in a flash！”Many men could draw with more or less success Norman England,or mediaeval France,but to reconstruct a whole dead civilization in so plausible a way,with such dignity and such minuteness of detail,is,I should think,a most wonderful tour de force.His failing health showed itself before the end of the novel,but had the latter half equaled the first,and contained scenes of such humor as Anna Comnena reading aloud her father's exploits,or of such majesty as the account of the muster of the Crusaders upon the shores of the Bosphorus,then the book could not have been gainsaid its rightful place in the very front rank of the novels.

I would that he had carried on his narrative,and given us a glimpse of the actual progress of the First Crusade.What an incident！Was ever anything in the world's history like it?It had what historical incidents seldom have,a definite beginning,middle and end,from the half-crazed preaching of Peter down to the Fall of Jerusalem.Those leaders！It would take a second Homer to do them justice.Godfrey the perfect soldier and leader,Bohemund the unscrupulous and formidable,Tancred the ideal knight errant,Robert of Normandy the half-mad hero！Here is material so rich that one feels one is not worthy to handle it.What richest imagination could ever evolve anything more marvelous and thrilling than the actual historical facts?

But what a glorious brotherhood the novels are！Think of the pure romance of“The Talisman”；the exquisite picture of Hebridean life in“The Pirate”；the splendid reproduction of Elizabethan England in“Kenilworth”；the rich humor of the“Legend of Montrose”；above all,bear in mind that in all that splendid series,written in a coarse age,there is not one word to offend the most sensitive ear,and it is borne in upon one how great and noble a man was Walter Scott,and how high the service which he did for literature and for humanity.

For that reason his life is good reading,and there it is on the same shelf as the novels.Lockhart was,of course,his son-in-law and his admiring friend.The ideal biographer should be a perfectly impartial man,with a sympathetic mind,but a stern determination to tell the absolute truth.One would like the frail,human side of a man as well as the other.I cannot believe that any one in the world was ever quite so good as the subject of most of our biographies.Surely these worthy people swore a little sometimes,or had a keen eye for a pretty face,or opened the second bottle when they would have done better to stop at the first,or did something to make us feel that they were men and brothers.They need not go the length of the lady who began a biography of her deceased husband with the words—“D—was a dirty man，”but the books certainly would be more readable,and the subjects more lovable too,if we had greater light and shade in the picture.

But I am sure that the more one knew of Scott the more one would have admired him.He lived in a drinking age,and in a drinking country,and I have not a doubt that he took an allowance of toddy occasionally of an evening which would have laid his feeble successors under the table.His last years,at least,poor fellow,were abstemious enough,when he sipped his barley-water,while the others passed the decanter.But what a high-souled chivalrous gentleman he was,with how fine a sense of honor,translating itself not into empty phrases,but into years of labor and denial！You remember how he became sleeping partner in a printing house,and so involved himself in its failure.There was a legal,but very little moral,claim against him,and no one could have blamed him had he cleared the account by a bankruptcy,which would have enabled him to become a rich man again within a few years.Yet he took the whole burden upon himself and bore it for the rest of his life,spending his work,his time,and his health in the one long effort to save his honor from the shadow of a stain.It was nearly a hundred thousand pounds,I think,which he passed on to the creditors—a great record,a hundred thousand pounds,with his life thrown in.

And what a power of work he had！It was superhuman.Only the man who has tried to write fiction himself knows what it means when it is recorded that Scott produced two of his long novels in one single year.I remember reading in some book of reminiscences—on second thoughts it was in Lockhart himself—how the writer had lodged in some rooms in Castle Street,Edinburgh,and how he had seen all evening the silhouette of a man outlined on the blind of the opposite house.All evening the man wrote,and the observer could see the shadow hand conveying the sheets of paper from the desk to the pile at the side.He went to a party and returned,but still the hand was moving the sheets.Next morning he was told that the rooms opposite were occupied by Walter Scott.

A curious glimpse into the psychology of the writer of fiction is shown by the fact that he wrote two of his books—good ones,too—at a time when his health was such that he could not afterwards remember one word of them,and listened to them when they were read to him as if he were hearing the work of another man.Apparently the simplest processes of the brain,such as ordinary memory,were in complete abeyance,and yet the very highest and most complex faculty—imagination in its supreme form—was absolutely unimpaired.It is an extraordinary fact,and one to be pondered over.It gives some support to the feeling which every writer of imaginative work must have,that his supreme work comes to him in some strange way from without,and that he is only the medium for placing it upon the paper.The creative thought—the germ thought from which a larger growth is to come,flies through his brain like a bullet.He is surprised at his own idea,with no conscious sense of having originated it.And here we have a man,with all other brain functions paralyzed,producing this magnificent work.Is it possible that we are indeed but conduit pipes from the infinite reservoir of the unknown?Certainly it is always our best work which leaves the least sense of personal effort.

And to pursue this line of thought,is it possible that frail physical powers and an unstable nervous system,by keeping a man's materialism at its lowest,render him a more fitting agent for these spiritual uses?It is an old tag that—

Great Genius is to madness close allied，

And thin partitions do those rooms divide.

But,apart from genius,even a moderate faculty for imaginative work seems to me to weaken seriously the ties between the soul and the body.

Look at the British poets of a century ago：Chatterton,Burns,Shelley,Keats,Byron.Burns was the oldest of that brilliant band,yet Burns was only thirty-eight when he passed away，“burned out，”as his brother terribly expressed it.Shelley,it is true,died by accident,and Chatterton by poison,but suicide is in itself a sign of a morbid state.It is true that Rogers lived to be almost a centenarian,but he was banker first and poet afterwards.Wordsworth,Tennyson,and Browning have all raised the average age of the poets,but for some reason the novelists,especially of late years,have a deplorable record.They will end by being scheduled with the white-lead workers and other dangerous trades.Look at the really shocking case of the young Americans,for example.What a band of promising young writers have in a few years been swept away！There was the author of that admirable book，“David Harum”；there was Frank Norris,a man who had in him,I think,the seeds of greatness more than almost any living writer.His“Pit”seemed to me one of the finest American novels.He also died a premature death.Then there was Stephen Crane—a man who had also done most brilliant work,and there was Harold Frederic,another master-craftsman.Is there any profession in the world which in proportion to its numbers could show such losses as that?In the meantime,out of our own men Robert Louis Stevenson is gone,and Henry Seton Merriman,and many another.

Even those great men who are usually spoken of as if they had rounded off their career were really premature in their end.Thackeray,for example,in spite of his snowy head,was only 52；Dickens attained the age of 58；on the whole.Sir Walter,with his 61 years of life,although he never wrote a novel until he was over 40，had,fortunately for the world,a longer working career than most of his brethren.

He employed his creative faculty for about twenty years,which is as much,I suppose,as Shakespeare did.The bard of Avon is another example of the limited tenure which Genius has of life,though I believe that he outlived the greater part of his own family,who were not a healthy stock.He died,I should judge,of some nervous disease；that is shown by the progressive degeneration of his signature.Probably it was locomotor ataxy,which is the special scourge of the imaginative man.Heine,Daudet,and how many more,were its victims.As to the tradition,first mentioned long after his death,that he died of a fever contracted from a drinking bout,it is absurd on the face of it,since no such fever is known to science.But a very moderate drinking bout would be extremely likely to bring a chronic nervous complaint to a disastrous end.

One other remark upon Scott before I pass on from that line of green volumes which has made me so digressive and so garrulous.No account of his character is complete which does not deal with the strange,secretive vein which ran through his nature.Not only did he stretch the truth on many occasions in order to conceal the fact that he was the author of the famous novels,but even intimate friends who met him day by day were not aware that he was the man about whom the whole of Europe was talking.Even his wife was ignorant of his pecuniary liabilities until the crash of the Ballantyne firm told her for the first time that they were sharers in the ruin.A psychologist might trace this strange twist of his mind in the numerous elfish Fenellalike characters who flit about and keep their irritating secret through the long chapters of so many of his novels.

It's a sad book,Lockhart's“Life.”It leaves gloom in the mind.The sight of this weary giant,staggering along,burdened with debt,overladen with work,his wife dead,his nerves broken,and nothing intact but his honor,is one of the most moving in the history of literature.But they pass,these clouds,and all that is left is the memory of the supremely noble man,who would not be bent,but faced Fate to the last,and died in his tracks without a whimper.He sampled every human emotion.Great was his joy and great his success,great was his downfall and bitter his grief.But of all the sons of men I don't think there are many greater than he who lies under the great slab at Dryburgh.





III


We can pass the long green ranks of the Waverley Novels and Lockhart's“Life”which flanks them.Here is heavier metal in the four big gray volumes beyond.They are an old-fashioned large-print edition of Boswell's“Life of Johnson.”I emphasize the large print,for that is the weak point of most of the cheap editions of English Classics which come now into the market.With subjects which are in the least archaic or abstruse you need good clear type to help you on your way.The other is good neither for your eyes nor for your temper.Better pay a little more and have a book that is made for use.

That book interests me—fascinates me—and yet I wish I could join heartily in that chorus of praise which the kind-hearted old bully has enjoyed.It is difficult to follow his own advice and to“clear one's mind of cant”upon the subject,for when you have been accustomed to look at him through the sympathetic glasses of Macaulay or of Boswell,it is hard to take them off,to rub one's eyes,and to have a good honest stare on one's own account at the man's actual words,deeds,and limitations.If you try it you are left with the oddest mixture of impressions.How could one express it save that this is John Bull taken to literature—the exaggerated John Bull of the caricaturists—with every quality,good or evil,at its highest?Here are the rough crust over a kindly heart,the explosive temper,the arrogance,the insular narrowness,the want of sympathy and insight,the rudeness of perception,the positiveness,the overbearing bluster,the strong deep-seated religious principle,and every other characteristic of the cruder,rougher John Bull who was the great-grandfather of the present good-natured Johnnie.

If Boswell had not lived I wonder how much we should hear now of his huge friend?With Scotch persistence he has succeeded in inoculating the whole world with his hero worship.It was most natural that he should himself admire him.The relations between the two men were delightful and reflect all credit upon each.But they are not a safe basis from which any third person could argue.When they met,Boswell was in his twenty-third and Johnson in his fifty-fourth year.The one was a keen young Scot with a mind which was reverent and impressionable.The other was a figure from a past generation with his fame already made.From the moment of meeting the one was bound to exercise an absolute ascendency over the other which made unbiased criticism far more difficult than it would be between ordinary father and son.Up to the end this was the unbroken relation between them.

It is all very well to pooh-pooh Boswell as Macaulay has done,but it is not by chance that a man writes the best biography in the language.He had some great and rare literary qualities.One was a clear and vivid style,more flexible and Saxon than that of his great model.Another was a remarkable discretion which hardly once permitted a fault of taste in this whole enormous book where he must have had to pick his steps with pitfalls on every side of him.They say that he was a fool and a coxcomb in private life.He is never so with a pen in his hand.Of all his numerous arguments with Johnson,where he ventured some little squeak of remonstrance,before the roaring“No,sir！”came to silence him,there are few in which his views were not,as experience proved,the wiser.On the question of slavery he was in the wrong.But I could quote from memory at least a dozen cases,including such vital subjects as the American Revolution,the Hanoverian Dynasty,Religious Toleration,and so on,where Boswell's views were those which survived.

But where he excels as a biographer is in telling you just those little things that you want to know.How often you read the life of a man and are left without the remotest idea of his personality.It is not so here.The man lives again.There is a short description of Johnson's person—it is not in the Life,but in the Tour to the Hebrides,the very next book upon the shelf,which is typical of his vivid portraiture.May I take it down,and read you a paragraph of it?—

His person was large,robust,I may say approaching to the gigantic,and grown unwieldy from corpulency.His countenance was naturally of the cast of an ancient statue,but somewhat disfigured by the scars of King’s evil.He was now in his sixty-fourth year and was become a little dull of hearing.His sight had always been somewhat weak,yet so much does mind govern and even supply the deficiencies of organs that his perceptions were uncommonly quick and accurate.His head,and sometimes also his body,shook with a kind of motion like the effect of palsy.He appeared to be frequently disturbed by cramps or convulsive contractions of the nature of that distemper called St.Vitus’dance.He wore a full suit of plain brown clothes,with twisted hair buttons of the same color,a large bushy grayish wig,a plain shirt,black worsted stockings and silver buckles.Upon this tour when journeying he wore boots and a very wide brown cloth great-coat with pockets which might almost have held the two volumes of his folio dictionary,and he carried in his hand a large English oak stick.

You must admit that if one cannot reconstruct the great Samuel after that it is not Mr.Boswell's fault—and it is but one of a dozen equally vivid glimpses which he gives us of his hero.It is just these pen-pictures of his of the big,uncouth man,with his grunts and his groans,his Gargantuan appetite,his twenty cups of tea,and his tricks with the orange-peel and the lamp-posts,which fascinate the reader,and have given Johnson a far broader literary vogue than his writings could have done.

For,after all,which of those writings can be said to have any life to-day?Not“Rasselas，”surely—that stilted romance.“The Lives of the Poets”are but a succession of prefaces,and the“Ramblers”of ephemeral essays.There is the monstrous drudgery of the Dictionary,a huge piece of spadework,a monument to industry,but inconceivable to genius.“London”has a few vigorous lines,and the“Journey to the Hebrides”some spirited pages.This,with a number of political and other pamphlets,was the main output of his lifetime.Surely it must be admitted that it is not enough to justify his predominant place in English literature,and that we must turn to his humble,much-ridiculed biographer for the real explanation.

And then there was his talk.What was it which gave it such distinction?His clear-cut positiveness upon every subject.But this is a sign of a narrow finality—impossible to the man of sympathy and of imagination,who sees the other side of every question and understands what a little island the greatest human knowledge must be in the ocean of infinite possibilities which surround us.Look at the results.Did ever any single man,the very dullest of the race,stand convicted of so many incredible blunders?It recalls the remark of Bagehot,that if at any time the views of the most learned could be stamped upon the whole human race the result would be to propagate the most absurd errors.He was asked what became of swallows in the winter.Rolling and wheezing,the oracle answered：“Swallows，”said he，“certainly sleep all the winter.A number of them conglobulate together by flying round and round,and then all in a heap throw themselves under water and lie in the bed of a river.”Boswell gravely dockets the information.However,if I remember right,even so sound a naturalist as White of Selborne had his doubts about the swallows.More wonderful are Johnson's misjudgments of his fellow-authors.There,if anywhere,one would have expected to find a sense of proportion.Yet his conclusions would seem monstrous to a modern taste.“Shakespeare，”he said，“never wrote six consecutive good lines.”He would only admit two good verses in Gray's exquisite“Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard，”where it would take a very acid critic to find two bad ones.“Tristram Shandy”would not live.“Hamlet”was gabble.Swift's“Gulliver's Travels”was poor stuff,and he never wrote anything good except“A Tale of a Tub.”Voltaire was illiterate.Rousseau was a scoundrel.Deists,like Hume,Priestley,or Gibbon,could not be honest men.

And his political opinions！They sound now like a caricature.I suppose even in those days they were reactionary.“A poor man has no honor.”“Charles the Second was a good King.”“Governments should turn out of the Civil Service all who were on the other side.”“Judges in India should be encouraged to trade.”“No country is the richer on account of trade.”（I wonder if Adam Smith was in the company when this proposition was laid down！）“A landed proprietor should turn out those tenants who did not vote as he wished.”“It is not good for a laborer to have his wages raised.”“When the balance of trade is against a country,the margin must be paid in current coin.”Those were a few of his convictions.

And then his prejudices！Most of us have some unreasoning aversion.In our more generous moments we are not proud of it.But consider those of Johnson！When they were all eliminated there was not so very much left.He hated Whigs.He disliked Scotsmen.He detested Nonconformists（a young lady who joined them was“an odious wench”）.He loathed Americans.So he walked his narrow line,belching fire and fury at everything to the right or the left of it.Macaulay's posthumous admiration is all very well,but had they met in life Macaulay would have contrived to unite under one hat nearly everything that Johnson abominated.

It cannot be said that these prejudices were founded on any strong principles,or that they could not be altered where his own personal interests demanded it.This is one of the weak points of his record.In his dictionary he abused pensions and pensioners as a means by which the State imposed slavery upon hirelings.When he wrote the unfortunate definition a pension must have seemed a most improbable contingency,but when George III.，either through policy or charity,offered him one a little later,he made no hesitation in accepting it.One would have liked to feel that the violent expression of his convictions represented a real intensity of feeling,but the facts in this instance seem against it.

He was a great talker—but his talk was more properly a monologue.It was a discursive essay,with perhaps a few marginal notes from his subdued audience.How could one talk on equal terms with a man who could not brook contradiction or even argument upon the most vital questions in life?Would Goldsmith defend his literary views,or Burke his Whiggism,or Gibbon his Deism?There was no common ground of philosophic toleration on which one could stand.If he could not argue he would be rude,or,as Goldsmith put it：“If his pistol missed fire,he would knock you down with the butt end.”In the face of that“rhinoceros laugh”there was an end of gentle argument.Napoleon said that all the other kings would say“Ouf！”when they heard he was dead,and so I cannot help thinking that the older men of Johnson's circle must have given a sigh of relief when at last they could speak freely on that which was near their hearts,without the danger of a scene where“Why,no,sir！”was very likely to ripen into“Let us have no more on't！”Certainly one would like to get behind Boswell's account,and to hear a chat between such men as Burke and Reynolds,as to the difference in the freedom and atmosphere of the Club on an evening when the formidable Doctor was not there,as compared to one when he was.

No smallest estimate of his character is fair which does not make due allowance for the terrible experiences of his youth and early middle age.His spirit was as scarred as his face.He was fifty-three when the pension was given him,and up to then his existence had been spent in one constant struggle for the first necessities of life,for the daily meal and the nightly bed.He had seen his comrades of letters die of actual privation.From childhood he had known no happiness.The half blind gawky youth,with dirty linen and twitching limbs,had always,whether in the streets of Lichfield,the quadrangle of Pembroke,or the coffee-houses of London,been an object of mingled pity and amusement.With a proud and sensitive soul,every day of his life must have brought some bitter humiliation.Such an experience must either break a man's spirit or embitter it,and here,no doubt,was the secret of that roughness,that carelessness for the sensibilities of others,which caused Boswell's father to christen him“Ursa Major.”If his nature was in any way warped,it must be admitted that terrific forces had gone to the rending of it.His good was innate,his evil the result of a dreadful experience.

And he had some great qualities.Memory was the chief of them.He had read omnivorously,and all that he had read he remembered,not merely in the vague,general way in which we remember what we read,but with every particular of place and date.If it were poetry,he could quote it by the page,Latin or English.Such a memory has its enormous advantage,but it carries with it its corresponding defect.With the mind so crammed with other people's goods,how can you have room for any fresh manufactures of your own?A great memory is,I think,often fatal to originality,in spite of Scott and some other exceptions.The slate must be clear before you put your own writing upon it.When did Johnson ever discover an original thought,when did he ever reach forward into the future,or throw any fresh light upon those enigmas with which mankind is faced?Overloaded with the past,he had space for nothing else.Modern developments of every sort cast no first herald rays upon his mind.He journeyed in France a few years before the greatest cataclysm that the world has ever known,and his mind,arrested by much that was trivial,never once responded to the storm-signals which must surely have been visible around him.We read that an amiable Monsieur Sansterre showed him over his brewery and supplied him with statistics as to his output of beer.It was the same foul-mouthed Sansterre who struck up the drums to drown Louis'voice at the scaffold.The association shows how near the unconscious sage was to the edge of that precipice and how little his learning availed him in discerning it.

He would have been a great lawyer or divine.Nothing,one would think,could have kept him from Canterbury or from the Woolsack.In either case his memory,his learning,his dignity,and his inherent sense of piety and justice,would have sent him straight to the top.His brain,working within its own limitations,was remarkable.There is no more wonderful proof of this than his opinions on questions of Scotch law,as given to Boswell and as used by the latter before the Scotch judges.That an outsider with no special training should at short notice write such weighty opinions,crammed with argument and reason,is,I think,as remarkable a tour de force as literature can show.

Above all,he really was a very kind-hearted man,and that must count for much.His was a large charity,and it came from a small purse.The rooms of his house became a sort of harbor of refuge in which several strange battered hulks found their last moorings.There were the blind Mr.Levett,and the acidulous Mrs.Williams,and the colorless Mrs.De Moulins,all old and ailing—a trying group amid which to spend one's days.His guinea was always ready for the poor acquaintance,and no poet was so humble that he might not preface his book with a dedication whose ponderous and sonorous sentences bore the hall-mark of their maker.It is the rough,kindly man,the man who bore the poor street-walker home upon his shoulders,who makes one forget,or at least forgive,the dogmatic pedantic Doctor of the Club.

There is always to me something of interest in the view which a great man takes of old age and death.It is the practical test of how far the philosophy of his life has been a sound one.Hume saw death afar,and met it with unostentatious calm.Johnson's mind flinched from that dread opponent.His letters and his talk during his later years are one long cry of fear.It was not cowardice,for physically he was one of the most stout-hearted men that ever lived.There were no limits to his courage.It was spiritual diffidence,coupled with an actual belief in the possibilities of the other world,which a more humane and liberal theology has done something to soften.How strange to see him cling so desperately to that crazy body,with its gout,its asthma,its St.Vitus'dance,and its six gallons of dropsy！What could be the attraction of an existence where eight hours of every day were spent groaning in a chair,and sixteen wheezing in a bed?“I would give one of these legs，”said he，“for another year of life.”None the less,when the hour did at last strike,no man could have borne himself with more simple dignity and courage.Say what you will of him,and resent him how you may,you can never open those four gray volumes without getting some mental stimulus,some desire for wider reading,some insight into human learning or character,which should leave you a better and a wiser man.





IV


Next to my Johnsoniana are my Gibbons—two editions,if you please,for my old complete one being somewhat crabbed in the print,I could not resist getting a set of Bury's new six-volume presentment of the History.In reading that book you don't want to be handicapped in any way.You want fair type,clear paper,and a light volume.You are not to read it lightly,but with some earnestness of purpose and keenness for knowledge,with a classical atlas at your elbow and a notebook hard by,taking easy stages and harking back every now and then to keep your grip of the past and to link it up with what follows.There are no thrills in it.You won't be kept out of your bed at night,nor will you forget your appointments during the day,but you will feel a certain sedate pleasure in the doing of it,and when it is done you will have gained something which you can never lose—something solid,something definite,something that will make you broader and deeper than before.

Were I condemned to spend a year upon a desert island and allowed only one book for my companion,it is certainly that which I should choose.For consider how enormous is its scope,and what food for thought is contained within those volumes.It covers a thousand years of the world's history,it is full and good and accurate,its standpoint is broadly philosophic,its style dignified.With our more elastic methods we may consider his manner pompous,but he lived in an age when Johnson's turgid periods had corrupted our literature.For my own part I do not dislike Gibbon's pomposity.A paragraph should be measured and sonorous if it ventures to describe the advance of a Roman legion,or the debate of a Greek Senate.You are wafted upwards,with this lucid and just spirit by your side upholding and instructing you.Beneath you are warring nations,the clash of races,the rise and fall of dynasties,the conflict of creeds.Serene you float above them all,and ever as the panorama flows past,the weighty measured unemotional voice whispers the true meaning of the scene into your ear.

It is a most mighty story that is told.You begin with a description of the state of the Roman Empire when the early Caesars were on the throne,and when it was undisputed Mistress of the World.You pass down the line of the Emperors with their strange alternations of greatness and profligacy,descending occasionally to criminal lunacy.When the Empire went rotten it began at the top,and it took centuries to corrupt the man behind the spear.Neither did a religion of peace affect him much,for,in spite of the adoption of Christianity,Roman history was still written in blood.The new creed had only added a fresh cause of quarrel and violence to the many which already existed,and the wars of angry nations were mild compared to those of excited sectaries.

Then came the mighty rushing wind from without,blowing from the waste places of the world,destroying,confounding,whirling madly through the old order,leaving broken chaos behind it,but finally cleansing and purifying that which was stale and corrupt.A storm-center somewhere in the north of China did suddenly what it may very well do again.The human volcano blew its top off,and Europe was covered by the destructive débris.The absurd point is that it was not the conquerors who overran the Roman Empire,but it was the terrified fugitives who,like a drove of stampeded cattle,blundered over everything which barred their way.It was a wild,dramatic time—the time of the formation of the modern races of Europe.The nations came whirling in out of the north and east like dust-storms,and amid the seeming chaos each was blended with its neighbor so as to toughen the fiber of the whole.The fickle Gaul got his steadying from the Franks,the steady Saxon got his touch of refinement from the Norman,the Italian got a fresh lease of life from the Lombard and the Ostrogoth,the corrupt Greek made way for the manly and earnest Mohammedan.Everywhere one seems to see a great hand blending the seeds.And so one can now,save only that emigration has taken the place of war.It does not,for example,take much prophetic power to say that something very great is being built up on the other side of the Atlantic.When on an Anglo-Celtic basis you see the Italian,the Hun,and the Scandinavian being added,you feel that there is no human quality which may not be thereby evolved.

But to revert to Gibbon：the next stage is the flight of Empire from Rome to Byzantium,even as the Anglo-Celtic power might find its center some day not in London but in Chicago or Toronto.There is the whole strange story of the tidal wave of Mohammedanism from the south,submerging all North Africa,spreading right and left to India on the one side and to Spain on the other,finally washing right over the walls of Byzantium until it,the bulwark of Christianity,became what it is now,the advanced European fortress of the Moslem.Such is the tremendous narrative covering half the world's known history,which can all be acquired and made part of yourself by the aid of that humble atlas,pencil,and note-book already recommended.

When all is so interesting it is hard to pick examples,but to me there has always seemed to be something peculiarly impressive in the first entrance of a new race on to the stage of history.It has something of the glamour which hangs round the early youth of a great man.You remember how the Russians made their début—came down the great rivers and appeared at the Bosphorus in two hundred canoes,from which they endeavored to board the Imperial galleys.Singular that a thousand years have passed and that the ambition of the Russians is still to carry out the task at which their skin-clad ancestors failed.Or the Turks again；you may recall the characteristic ferocity with which they opened their career.A handful of them were on some mission to the Emperor.The town was besieged from the landward side by the barbarians,and the Asiatics obtained leave to take part in a skirmish.The first Turk galloped out,shot a barbarian with his arrow,and then,lying down beside him,proceeded to suck his blood,which so horrified the man’s comrades that they could not be brought to face such uncanny adversaries.So,from opposite sides,those two great races arrived at the city which was to be the stronghold of the one and the ambition of the other for so many centuries.

And then,even more interesting than the races which arrive are those that disappear.There is something there which appeals most powerfully to the imagination.Take,for example,the fate of those Vandals who conquered the north of Africa.They were a German tribe,blue-eyed and flaxen-haired,from somewhere in the Elbe country.Suddenly they,too,were seized with the strange wandering madness which was epidemic at the time.Away they went on the line of least resistance,which is always from north to south and from east to west.Southwest was the course of the Vandals—a course which must have been continued through pure love of adventure,since in the thousands of miles which they traversed there were many fair resting-places,if that were only their quest.

They crossed the south of France,conquered Spain,and,finally,the more adventurous passed over into Africa,where they occupied the old Roman province.For two or three generations they held it,much as the English hold India,and their numbers were at the least some hundreds of thousands.Presently the Roman Empire gave one of those flickers which showed that there was still some fire among the ashes.Belisarius landed in Africa and reconquered the province.The Vandals were cut off from the sea and fled inland.Whither did they carry those blue eyes and that flaxen hair?Were they exterminated by the negroes,or did they amalgamate with them?Travelers have brought back stories from the Mountains of the Moon of a Negroid race with light eyes and hair.Is it possible that here we have some trace of the vanished Germans?

It recalls the parallel case of the lost settlements in Greenland.That also has always seemed to me to be one of the most romantic questions in history—the more so,perhaps,as I have strained my eyes to see across the ice-floes the Greenland coast at the point（or near it）where the old“Eyrbyggia”must have stood.That was the Scandinavian city,founded by colonists from Iceland,which grew to be a considerable place,so much so that they sent to Denmark for a bishop.That would be in the fourteenth century.The bishop,coming out to his see,found that he was unable to reach it on account of a climatic change which had brought down the ice and filled the strait between Iceland and Greenland.From that day to this no one has been able to say what has become of these old Scandinavians,who were at the time,be it remembered,the most civilized and advanced race in Europe.They may have been overwhelmed by the Esquimaux,the despised Skroeling—or they may have amalgamated with them—or conceivably they might have held their own.Very little is known yet of that portion of the coast.It would be strange if some Nansen or Peary were to stumble upon the remains of the old colony,and find possibly in that antiseptic atmosphere a complete mummy of some bygone civilization.

But once more to return to Gibbon.What a mind it must have been which first planned,and then,with the incessant labor of twenty years,carried out that enormous work！There was no classical author so little known,no Byzantine historian so diffuse,no monkish chronicle so crabbed,that they were not assimilated and worked into their appropriate place in the huge framework.Great application,great perseverance,great attention to detail was needed in all this,but the coral polyp has all those qualities,and somehow in the heart of his own creation the individuality of the man himself becomes as insignificant and as much overlooked as that of the little creature that builds the reef.A thousand know Gibbon's work for one who cares anything for Gibbon.

And on the whole this is justified by the facts.Some men are greater than their work.Their work only represents one facet of their character,and there may be a dozen others,all remarkable,and uniting to make one complex and unique creature.It was not so with Gibbon.He was a cold-blooded man,with a brain which seemed to have grown at the expense of his heart.I cannot recall in his life one generous impulse,one ardent enthusiasm,save for the Classics.His excellent judgment was never clouded by the haze of human emotion—or,at least,it was such an emotion as was well under the control of his will.Could anything be more laudable—or less lovable?He abandons his girl at the order of his father,and sums it up that he“sighs as a lover but obeys as a son.”The father dies,and he records the fact with the remark that“the tears of a son are seldom lasting.”The terrible spectacle of the French Revolution excited in his mind only a feeling of self-pity because his retreat in Switzerland was invaded by the unhappy refugees,just as a grumpy country gentleman in England might complain that he was annoyed by the trippers.There is a touch of dislike in all the allusions which Boswell makes to Gibbon—often without even mentioning his name—and one cannot read the great historian's life without understanding why.

I should think that few men have been born with the material for self-sufficient contentment more completely within himself than Edward Gibbon.He had every gift which a great scholar should have,an insatiable thirst for learning in every form,immense industry,a retentive memory,and that broadly philosophic temperament which enables a man to rise above the partisan and to become the impartial critic of human affairs.It is true that at the time he was looked upon as bitterly prejudiced in the matter of religious thought,but his views are familiar to modern philosophy,and would shock no susceptibilities in these more liberal（and more virtuous）days.Turn him up in that Encyclopedia,and see what the latest word is upon his contentions.“Upon the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters it is not necessary to dwell，”says the biographer，“because at this time of day no Christian apologist dreams of denying the substantial truth of any of the more important allegations of Gibbon.Christians may complain of the suppression of some circumstances which might influence the general result,and they must remonstrate against the unfair construction of their case.But they no longer refuse to hear any reasonable evidence tending to show that persecution was less severe than had been once believed,and they have slowly learned that they can afford to concede the validity of all the secondary causes assigned by Gibbon and even of others still more discreditable.The fact is,as the historian has again and again admitted,that his account of the secondary causes which contributed to the progress and establishment of Christianity leaves the question as to the natural or supernatural origin of Christianity practically untouched.”This is all very well,but in that case how about the century of abuse which has been showered upon the historian?Some posthumous apology would seem to be called for.

Physically,Gibbon was as small as Johnson was large,but there was a curious affinity in their bodily ailments.Johnson,as a youth,was ulcerated and tortured by the king's evil,in spite of the Royal touch.Gibbon gives us a concise but lurid account of his own boyhood.

I was successively afflicted by lethargies and fevers,by opposite tendencies to a consumptive and dropsical habit,by a contraction of my nerves,a fistula in my eye,and the bite of a dog,most vehemently suspected of madness.Every practitioner was called to my aid,the fees of the doctors were swelled by the bills of the apothecaries and surgeons.There was a time when I swallowed more physic than food,and my body is still marked by the indelible scars of lancets,issues,and caustics.

Such is his melancholy report.The fact is that the England of that day seems to have been very full of that hereditary form of chronic ill-health which we call by the general name of struma.How far the hard-drinking habits in vogue for a century or so before had anything to do with it I cannot say,nor can I trace a connection between struma and learning；but one has only to compare this account of Gibbon with Johnson's nervous twitches,his scarred face and his St.Vitus'dance,to realize that these,the two most solid English writers of their generation,were each heir to the same gruesome inheritance.

I wonder if there is any picture extant of Gibbon in the character of subaltern in the South Hampshire Militia?With his small frame,his huge head,his round,chubby face,and the pretentious uniform,he must have looked a most extraordinary figure.Never was there so round a peg in a square hole！His father,a man of a very different type,held a commission,and this led to poor Gibbon becoming a soldier in spite of himself.War had broken out,the regiment was mustered,and the unfortunate student,to his own utter dismay,was kept under arms until the conclusion of hostilities.For three years he was divorced from his books,and loudly and bitterly did he resent it.The South Hampshire Militia never saw the enemy,which is perhaps as well for them.Even Gibbon himself pokes fun at them；but after three years under canvas it is probable that his men had more cause to smile at their book-worm captain than he at his men.His hand closed much more readily on a pen-handle than on a sword-hilt.In his lament,one of the items is that his colonel's example encouraged the daily practice of hard,and even excessive drinking,which gave him the gout.“The loss of so many busy and idle hours were not compensated for by any elegant pleasure，”says he；“and my temper was insensibly soured by the society of rustic officers,who were alike deficient in the knowledge of scholars and the manners of gentlemen.”The picture of Gibbon flushed with wine at the mess-table,with these hard-drinking squires around him,must certainly have been a curious one.He admits,however,that he found consolations as well as hardships in his spell of soldiering.It made him an Englishman once more,it improved his health,it changed the current of his thoughts.It was even useful to him as an historian.In a celebrated and characteristic sentence,he says，“The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the Phalanx and the Legions,and the captain of the Hampshire Grenadiers has not been useless to the historian of the Roman Empire.”

If we don't know all about Gibbon it is not his fault,for he wrote no fewer than six accounts of his own career,each differing from the other,and all equally bad.A man must have more heart and soul than Gibbon to write a good autobiography.It is the most difficult of all human compositions,calling for a mixture of tact,discretion,and frankness which make an almost impossible blend.Gibbon,in spite of his foreign education,was a very typical Englishman in many ways,with the reticence,self-respect,and self-consciousness of the race.No British autobiography has ever been frank,and consequently no British autobiography has ever been good.Trollope's,perhaps,is as good as any that I know,but of all forms of literature it is the one least adapted to the national genius.You could not imagine a British Rousseau,still less a British Benvenuto Cellini.In one way it is to the credit of the race that it should be so.If we do as much evil as our neighbors we at least have grace enough to be ashamed of it and to suppress its publication.

There on the left of Gibbon is my fine edition（Lord Braybrooke's）of Pepys'Diary.That is,in truth,the greatest autobiography in our language,and yet it was not deliberately written as such.When Mr.Pepys jotted down from day to day every quaint or mean thought which came into his head he would have been very much surprised had any one told him that he was doing a work quite unique in our literature.Yet his involuntary autobiography,compiled for some obscure reason or for private reference,but certainly never meant for publication,is as much the first in that line of literature as Boswell's book among biographies or Gibbon's among histories.

As a race we are too afraid of giving ourselves away ever to produce a good autobiography.We resent the charge of national hypocrisy,and yet of all nations we are the least frank as to our own emotions—especially on certain sides of them.Those affairs of the heart,for example,which are such an index to a man's character,and so profoundly modify his life—what space do they fill in any man's autobiography?Perhaps in Gibbon's case the omission matters little,for,save in the instance of his well-controlled passion for the future Madame Neckar,his heart was never an organ which gave him much trouble.The fact is that when the British author tells his own story he tries to make himself respectable,and the more respectable a man is the less interesting does he become.Rousseau may prove himself a maudlin degenerate.Cellini may stand self-convicted as an amorous ruffian.If they are not respectable they are thoroughly human and interesting all the same.

The wonderful thing about Mr.Pepys is that a man should succeed in making himself seem so insignificant when really he must have been a man of considerable character and attainments.Who would guess it who read all these trivial comments,these catalogues of what he had for dinner,these inane domestic confidences—all the more interesting for their inanity！The effect left upon the mind is of some grotesque character in a play,fussy,self-conscious,blustering with women,timid with men,dress-proud,purse-proud,trimming in politics and in religion,a garrulous gossip immersed always in trifles.And yet,though this was the day-by-day man,the year-by-year man was a very different person,a devoted civil servant,an eloquent orator,an excellent writer,a capable musician,and a ripe scholar who accumulated 3，000 volumes—a large private library in those days—and had the public spirit to leave them all to his University.You can forgive old Pepys a good deal of his philandering when you remember that he was the only official of the Navy Office who stuck to his post during the worst days of the Plague.He may have been—indeed,he assuredly was—a coward,but the coward who has sense of duty enough to overcome his cowardice is the most truly brave of mankind.

But the one amazing thing which will never be explained about Pepys is what on earth induced him to go to the incredible labor of writing down in shorthand cipher not only all the trivialities of his life,but even his own very gross delinquencies which any other man would have been only too glad to forget.The Diary was kept for about ten years,and was abandoned because the strain upon his eyes of the crabbed shorthand was helping to destroy his sight.I suppose that he became so familiar with it that he wrote it and read it as easily as he did ordinary script.But even so,it was a huge labor to compile these books of strange manuscript.Was it an effort to leave some memorial of his own existence to single him out from all the countless sons of men?In such a case he would assuredly have left directions in somebody's care with a reference to it in the deed by which he bequeathed his library to Cambridge.In that way he could have ensured having his Diary read at any date he chose to name after his death.But no allusion to it was left,and if it had not been for the ingenuity and perseverance of a single scholar the dusty volumes would still lie unread in some top shelf of the Pepysian Library.Publicity,then,was not his object.What could it have been?The only alternative is reference and self-information.You will observe in his character a curious vein of method and order by which he loved to be for ever estimating his exact wealth,cataloguing his books,or scheduling his possessions.It is conceivable that this systematic recording of his deeds—even of his misdeeds—was in some sort analogous,sprung from a morbid tidiness of mind.It may be a weak explanation but it is difficult to advance another one.

One minor point which must strike the reader of Pepys is how musical a nation the English of that day appear to have been.Everyone seems to have had command of some instrument,many of several.Part-singing was common.There is not much of Charles the Second's days which we need envy,but there,at least,they seem to have had the advantage of us.It was real music,too—music of dignity and tenderness—with words which were worthy of such treatment.This cult may have been the last remains of those mediaeval pre-Reformation days when the English Church choirs were,as I have read somewhere,the most famous in Europe.A strange thing this for a land which in the whole of last century has produced no single master of the first rank！

What national change is it which has driven music from the land?Has life become so serious that song has passed out of it?In Southern climes one hears poor folk sing for pure lightness of heart.In England,alas,the sound of a poor man's voice raised in song means only too surely that he is drunk.And yet it is consoling to know that the germ of the old powers is always there ready to sprout forth if they be nourished and cultivated.If our cathedral choirs were the best in the old Catholic days,it is equally true,I believe,that our orchestral associations are now the best in Europe.So,at least,the German papers said on the occasion of the recent visit of a north of England choir.But one cannot read Pepys without knowing that the general musical habit is much less cultivated now than of old.

It is a long jump from Samuel Pepys to George Borrow—from one pole of the human character to the other—and yet they are in contact on the shelf of my favorite authors.There is something wonderful,I think,about the land of Cornwall.That long peninsula extending out into the ocean has caught all sorts of strange floating things,and has held them there in isolation until they have woven themselves into the texture of the Cornish race.What is this strange strain which lurks down yonder and every now and then throws up a great man with singular un-English ways and features for all the world to marvel at?It is not Celtic,nor is it the dark old Iberian.Further and deeper lie the springs.Is it not Semitic,Phoenician,the roving men of Tyre,with noble Southern faces and Oriental imaginations,who have in far-off days forgotten their blue Mediterranean and settled on the granite shores of the Northern Sea?

Whence came the wonderful face and great personality of Henry Irving?How strong,how beautiful,how un-Saxon it was！I only know that his mother was a Cornish woman.Whence came the intense glowing imagination of the Brontës—so unlike the Miss-Austen-like calm of their predecessors?Again,I only know that their mother was a Cornish woman.Whence came this huge elfin creature,George Borrow,with his eagle head perched on his rocklike shoulders,brown-faced,white-headed,a king among men?Where did he get that remarkable face,those strange mental gifts,which place him by himself in literature?Once more,his father was a Cornishman.Yes,there is something strange,and weird,and great,lurking down yonder in the great peninsula which juts into the western sea.Borrow may,if he so pleases,call himself an East Anglian—“an English Englishman，”as he loved to term it—but is it a coincidence that the one East Anglian born of Cornish blood was the one who showed these strange qualities?The birth was accidental.The qualities throw back to the twilight of the world.

There are some authors from whom I shrink because they are so voluminous that I feel that,do what I may,I can never hope to be well read in their works.Therefore,and very weakly,I avoid them altogether.There is Balzac,for example,with his hundred odd volumes.I am told that some of them are masterpieces and the rest pot-boilers,but that no one is agreed which is which.Such an author makes an undue claim upon the little span of mortal years.Because he asks too much one is inclined to give him nothing at all.Dumas,too！I stand on the edge of him,and look at that huge crop,and content myself with a sample here and there.But no one could raise this objection to Borrow.A month's reading—even for a leisurely reader—will master all that he has written.There are“Lavengro，”“The Bible in Spain，”“Romany Rye，”and,finally,if you wish to go further，“Wild Wales.”Only four books—not much to found a great reputation upon—but,then,there are no other four books quite like them in the language.

He was a very strange man,bigoted,prejudiced,obstinate,inclined to be sulky,as wayward as a man could be.So far his catalogue of qualities does not seem to pick him as a winner.But he had one great and rare gift.He preserved through all his days a sense of the great wonder and mystery of life—the child sense which is so quickly dulled.Not only did he retain it himself,but he was word-master enough to make other people hark back to it also.As he writes you cannot help seeing through his eyes,and nothing which his eyes saw or his ear heard was ever dull or commonplace.It was all strange,mystic,with some deeper meaning struggling always to the light.If he chronicled his conversation with a washerwoman there was something arresting in the words he said,something singular in her reply.If he met a man in a public-house one felt,after reading his account,that one would wish to know more of that man.If he approached a town he saw and made you see—not a collection of commonplace houses or frowsy streets,but something very strange and wonderful,the winding river,the noble bridge,the old castle,the shadows of the dead.Every human being,every object,was not so much a thing in itself,as a symbol and reminder of the past.He looked through a man at that which the man represented.Was his name Welsh?Then in an instant the individual is forgotten and he is off,dragging you in his train,to ancient Britons,intrusive Saxons,unheard-of bards,Owen Glendower,mountain raiders and a thousand fascinating things.Or is it a Danish name?He leaves the individual in all his modern commonplace while he flies off to huge skulls at Hythe（in parenthesis I may remark that I have examined the said skulls with some care,and they seemed to me to be rather below the human average），to Vikings,Berserkers,Varangians,Harald Haardraada,and the innate wickedness of the Pope.To Borrow all roads lead to Rome.

But,my word,what English the fellow could write！What an organ-roll he could get into his sentences！How nervous and vital and vivid it all is！

There is music in every line of it if you have been blessed with an ear for the music of prose.Take the chapter in“Lavengro”of how the screaming horror came upon his spirit when he was encamped in the Dingle.The man who wrote that has caught the true mantle of Bunyan and Defoe.And,observe the art of it,under all the simplicity—notice,for example,the curious weird effect produced by the studied repetition of the word“dingle”coming ever round and round like the master-note in a chime.Or take the passage about Britain towards the end of“The Bible in Spain.”I hate quoting from these masterpieces,if only for the very selfish reason that my poor setting cannot afford to show up brilliants.None the less,cost what it may,let me transcribe that one noble piece of impassioned prose—

O England！long,long may it be ere the sun of thy glory sink beneath the wave of darkness！Though gloomy and portentous clouds are now gathering rapidly around thee,still,still may it please the Almighty to disperse them,and to grant thee a futurity longer in duration and still brighter in renown than thy past！Or,if thy doom be at hand,may that doom be a noble one,and worthy of her who has been styled the Old Queen of the waters！May thou sink,if thou dost sink,amidst blood and flame,with a mighty noise,causing more than one nation to participate in thy downfall！Of all fates,may it please the Lord to preserve thee from a disgraceful and a slow decay；becoming,ere extinct,a scorn and a mockery for those selfsame foes who now,though they envy and abhor thee,still fear thee,nay even against their will,honor and respect thee…….Remove from thee

the false prophets,who have seen vanity and divined lies；who have daubed thy wall with untempered mortar,that it may fall；who see visions of peace where there is no peace；who have strengthened the hands of the wicked,and made the heart of the righteous sad.Oh,do this,and fear not the result,for either shall thy end be a majestic and an enviable one；or God shall perpetuate thy reign upon the waters,thou Old Queen！

Or take the fight with the Flaming Tinman.It's too long for quotation—but read it,read every word of it.Where in the language can you find a stronger,more condensed and more restrained narrative?I have seen with my own eyes many a noble fight,more than one international battle,where the best of two great countries have been pitted against each other—yet the second-hand impression of Borrow's description leaves a more vivid remembrance upon my mind than any of them.This is the real witchcraft of letters.

He was a great fighter himself.He has left a secure reputation in other than literary circles—circles which would have been amazed to learn that he was a writer of books.With his natural advantages,his six foot three of height and his staglike agility,he could hardly fail to be formidable.But he was a scientific sparrer as well,though he had,I have been told,a curious sprawling fashion of his own.And how his heart was in it—how he loved the fighting men！You remember his thumbnail sketches of his heroes.If you don't I must quote one,and if you do you will be glad to read it again—

There’s Cribb,the Champion of England,and perhaps the best man in England；there he is,with his huge,massive figure,and face wonderfully like that of a lion.There is Belcher,the younger,not the mighty one,who is gone to his place,but the Teucer Belcher,the most scientific pugilist that ever entered a ring,only wanting strength to be I won’t say what.He appears to walk before me now,as he did that evening,with his white hat,white great-coat,thin genteel figure,springy step,and keen determined eye.Crosses him,what a contrast！Grim,savage Shelton,who has a civil word for nobody,and a hard blow for anybody.Hard！One blow given with the proper play of his athletic arm will unsense a giant.Yonder individual,who strolls about with his hands behind him,supporting his brown coat lappets,undersized,and who looks anything but what he is,is the king of the light-weights,so-called—Randall！The terrible Randall,who has Irish blood in his veins；not the better for that,nor the worse；and not far from him

is his last antagonist,Ned Turner,who,though beaten by him,still thinks himself as good a man,in which he is,perhaps,right,for it was a near thing.But how shall I name them all?They were there by dozens,and all tremendous in their way.There was Bulldog Hudson,and fearless Scroggins,who beat the conqueror of Sam the Jew.There was Black Richmond—no,he was not there,but I knew him well；he was the most dangerous of blacks,even with a broken thigh.There was Purcell,who could never conquer until all seemed over with him.There was—what！shall I name thee last?Ay,why not?I believe that thou art the last of all that strong family still above the sod,where mayst thou long continue—true piece of English stuff—Tom of Bedford.Hail to thee,Tom of Bedford,or by whatever name it may please thee to be called.Spring or Winter！Hail to thee,six-foot Englishman of the brown eye,worthy to have carried a six-foot bow at Flodden,where England’s yeomen triumphed over Scotland’s King,his clans and chivalry.Hail to thee,last of English bruisers,after all the many victories which thou hast achieved—true English victories,unbought by yellow gold.

Those are words from the heart.Long may it be before we lose the fighting blood which has come to us from of old！In a world of peace we shall at last be able to root it from our natures.In a world which is armed to the teeth it is the last and only guarantee of our future.Neither our numbers,nor our wealth,nor the waters which guard us can hold us safe if once the old iron passes from our spirit.Barbarous,perhaps—but there are possibilities for barbarism,and none in this wide world for effeminacy.

Borrow's views of literature and of literary men were curious.Publisher and brother author,he hated them with a fine comprehensive hatred.In all his books I cannot recall a word of commendation to any living writer,nor has he posthumous praise for those of the generation immediately preceding.Southey,indeed,he commends with what most would regard as exaggerated warmth,but for the rest he who lived when Dickens,Thackeray,and Tennyson were all in their glorious prime,looks fixedly past them at some obscure Dane or forgotten Welshman.The reason was,I expect,that his proud soul was bitterly wounded by his own early failures and slow recognition.He knew himself to be a chief in the clan,and when the clan heeded him not he withdrew in haughty disdain.Look at his proud,sensitive face and you hold the key to his life.

Harking back and talking of pugilism,I recall an incident which gave me pleasure.A friend of mine read a pugilistic novel called“Rodney Stone”to a famous Australian prize-fighter,stretched upon a bed of mortal sickness.The dying gladiator listened with intent interest but keen,professional criticism to the combats of the novel.The reader had got to the point where the young amateur fights the brutal Berks.Berks is winded,but holds his adversary off with a stiff left arm.The amateur's second in the story,an old prize-fighter,shouts some advice to him as to how to deal with the situation.“That's right.By—he's got him！”yelled the stricken man in the bed.Who cares for critics after that?

You can see my own devotion to the ring in that trio of brown volumes which stand,appropriately enough,upon the flank of Borrow.They are the three volumes of“Pugilistica，”given me years ago by my old friend,Robert Barr,a mine in which you can never pick for half an hour without striking it rich.Alas！for the horrible slang of those days,the vapid,witless Corinthian talk,with its ogles and it fogles,its pointless jokes,its maddening habit of italicizing a word or two in every sentence.Even these stern and desperate encounters,fit sports for the men of Albuera and Waterloo,become dull and vulgar,in that dreadful jargon.You have to turn to Hazlitt's account of the encounter between the Gasman and the Bristol Bull,to feel the savage strength of it all.It is a hardened reader who does not wince even in print before that frightful right-hander which felled the giant,and left him in“red ruin”from eyebrow to jaw.But even if there be no Hazlitt present to describe such a combat it is a poor imagination which is not fired by the deeds of the humble heroes who lived once so vividly upon earth,and now only appeal to faithful ones in these little-read pages.They were picturesque creatures,men of great force of character and will,who reached the limits of human bravery and endurance.There is Jackson on the cover,gold upon brown，“gentleman Jackson，”Jackson of the balustrade calf and the noble head,who wrote his name with an 88-pound weight dangling from his little finger.

Here is a pen-portrait of him by one who knew him well—

I can see him now as I saw him in’84 walking down Holborn Hill,towards Smithfield.He had on a scarlet coat worked in gold at the buttonholes,ruffles and frill of fine lace,a small white stock,no collar（they were not then invented），a looped hat with a broad black band,buff knee-breeches and long silk strings,striped white silk stockings,pumps and paste buckles；his waistcoat was pale blue satin,sprigged with white.It was impossible to look on his fine ample chest,his noble shoulders,his waist（if anything too small），his large but not too large hips,his balustrade calf and beautifully turned but not over delicate ankle,his firm foot and peculiarly small hand,without thinking that nature had

sent him on earth as a model.On he went at a good five miles and a half an hour,the envy of all men and the admiration of all women.

Now,that is a discriminating portrait—a portrait which really helps you to see that which the writer sets out to describe.After reading it one can understand why even in reminiscent sporting descriptions of those old days,amid all the Toms and Bills and Jacks,it is always Mr.John Jackson.He was the friend and instructor of Byron and of half the bloods in town.Jackson it was who,in the heat of combat,seized the Jew Mendoza by the hair,and so ensured that the pugs for ever afterwards should be a close-cropped race.Inside you see the square face of old Broughton,the supreme fighting man of the eighteenth century,the man whose humble ambition it was to begin with the pivot man of the Prussian Guard,and work his way through the regiment.He had a chronicler,the good Captain Godfrey,who has written some English which would take some beating.How about this passage?—

He stops as regularly as the swordsman,and carries his blows truly in the line；he steps not back distrustful of himself,to stop a blow,and puddle in the return,with an arm unaided by his body,producing but flyflap blows.

No！Broughton steps boldly and firmly in,bids a welcome to the coming blow；receives it with his guardian arm；then,with a general summons of his swelling muscles,and his firm body seconding his arm,and supplying it with all its weight,pours the pile-driving force upon his man.

One would like a little more from the gallant Captain.Poor Broughton！He fought once too often.“Why,damn you,you're beat！”cried the Royal Duke.“Not beat,your highness,but I can't see my man！”cried the blinded old hero.Alas,there is the tragedy of the ring as it is of life！The wave of youth surges ever upwards,and the wave that went before is swept sobbing on to the shingle.“Youth will be served，”said the terse old pugs.But what so sad as the downfall of the old champion！Wise Tom Spring—Tom of Bedford,as Borrow calls him—had the wit to leave the ring unconquered in the prime of his fame.Cribb also stood out as a champion.But Broughton,Slack,Belcher,and the rest—their end was one common tragedy.

The latter days of the fighting men were often curious and unexpected,though as a rule they were short-lived,for the alternation of the excess of their normal existence and the asceticism of their training undermined their constitution.Their popularity among both men and women was their undoing,and the king of the ring went down at last before that deadliest of light-weights,the microbe of tubercle,or some equally fatal and perhaps less reputable bacillus.The crockiest of spectators had a better chance of life than the magnificent young athlete whom he had come to admire.Jem Belcher died at 30，Hooper at 31，Pearce,the Game Chicken,at 32，Turner at 35，Hudson at 38，Randall,the Nonpareil,at 34.Occasionally,when they did reach mature age,their lives took the strangest turns.Gully,as is well known,became a wealthy man,and Member for Pontefract in the Reform Parliament.Humphries developed into a successful coal merchant.Jack Martin became a convinced teetotaller and vegetarian.Jem Ward,the Black Diamond,developed considerable powers as an artist.Cribb,Spring,Langan,and many others,were successful publicans.Strangest of all,perhaps,was Broughton,who spent his old age haunting every sale of old pictures and bric-à-brac.One who saw him has recorded his impression of the silent old gentleman,clad in old-fashioned garb,with his catalogue in his hand—Broughton,once the terror of England,and now the harmless and gentle collector.

Many of them,as was but natural,died violent deaths,some by accident and a few by their own hands.No man of the first class ever died in the ring.The nearest approach to it was the singular and mournful fate which befell Simon Byrne,the brave Irishman,who had the misfortune to cause the death of his antagonist,Angus Mackay,and afterwards met his own end at the hands of Deaf Burke.Neither Byrne nor Mackay could,however,be said to be boxers of the very first rank.It certainly would appear,if we may argue from the prize-ring,that the human machine becomes more delicate and is more sensitive to jar or shock.In the early days a fatal end to a fight was exceedingly rare.Gradually such tragedies became rather more common,until now even with the gloves they have shocked us by their frequency,and we feel that the rude play of our forefathers is indeed too rough for a more highly organized generation.Still,it may help us to clear our minds of cant if we remember that within two or three years the hunting-field and the steeple-chase claim more victims than the prize-ring has done in two centuries.

Many of these men had served their country well with that strength and courage which brought them fame.Cribb was,if I mistake not,in the Royal Navy.So was the terrible dwarf Scroggins,all chest and shoulders,whose springing hits for many a year carried all before them until the canny Welshman,Ned Turner,stopped his career,only to be stopped in turn by the brilliant Irishman,Jack Randall.Shaw,who stood high among the heavy-weights,was cut to pieces by the French Cuirassiers in the first charge at Waterloo.The brutal Berks died greatly in the breach of Badajos.The lives of these men stood for something,and that was just the one supreme thing which the times called for—an unflinching endurance which could bear up against a world in arms.Look at Jem Belcher—beautiful,heroic Jem,a manlier Byron—but there,this is not an essay on the old prize-ring,and one man's lore is another man's bore.Let us pass those three low-down,unjustifiable,fascinating volumes,and on to nobler topics beyond！





VI


Which are the great short stories of the English language?Not a bad basis for a debate！This I am sure of：that there are far fewer supremely good short stories than there are supremely good long books.It takes more exquisite skill to carve the cameo than the statue.But the strangest thing is that the two excellences seem to be separate and even antagonistic.Skill in the one by no means ensures skill in the other.The great masters of our literature,Fielding,Scott,Dickens,Thackeray,Reade,have left no single short story of outstanding merit behind them,with the possible exception of Wandering Willie's Tale in“Redgauntlet.”On the other hand,men who have been very great in the short story,Stevenson,Poe,and Bret Harte,have written no great book.The champion sprinter is seldom a five-miler as well.

Well,now,if you had to choose your team whom would you put in?You have not really a large choice.What are the points by which you judge them?You want strength,novelty,compactness,intensity of interest,a single vivid impression left upon the mind.Poe is the master of all.I may remark by the way that it is the sight of his green cover,the next in order upon my favorite shelf,which has started this train of thought.Poe is,to my mind,the supreme original short story writer of all time.His brain was like a seed-pod full of seeds which flew carelessly around,and from which have sprung nearly all our modern types of story.Just think of what he did in his offhand,prodigal fashion,seldom troubling to repeat a success,but pushing on to some new achievement.To him must be ascribed the monstrous progeny of writers on the detection of crime—“quorum pars parva fui！”Each may find some little development of his own,but his main art must trace back to those admirable stories of Monsieur Dupin,so wonderful in their masterful force,their reticence,their quick dramatic point.After all,mental acuteness is the one quality which can be ascribed to the ideal detective,and when that has once been admirably done,succeeding writers must necessarily be content for all time to follow in the same main track.But not only is Poe the originator of the detective story；all treasure-hunting,cryptogram-solving yarns trace back to his“Gold Bug，”just as all pseudo-scientific Verne-and-Wells stories have their prototypes in the“Voyage to the Moon，”and the“Case of Monsieur Valdemar.”If every man who receives a cheque for a story which owes its springs to Poe were to pay tithe to a monument for the master,he would have a pyramid as big as that of Cheops.

And yet I could only give him two places in my team.One would be for the“Gold Bug，”the other for the“Murder in the Rue Morgue.”I do not see how either of those could be bettered.But I would not admit perfect excellence to any other of his stories.These two have a proportion and a perspective which are lacking in the others,the horror or weirdness of the idea intensified by the coolness of the narrator and of the principal actor,Dupin in the one case and Le Grand in the other.The same may be said of Bret Harte,also one of those great short story tellers who proved himself incapable of a longer flight.He was always like one of his own gold-miners who struck a rich pocket,but found no continuous reef.The pocket was,alas,a very limited one,but the gold was of the best.“The Luck of Roaring Camp”and“Tennessee's Partner”are both,I think,worthy of a place among my immortals.They are,it is true,so tinged with Dickens as to be almost parodies of the master,but they have a symmetry and satisfying completeness as short stories to which Dickens himself never attained.The man who can read those two stories without a gulp in the throat is not a man I envy.

And Stevenson?Surely he shall have two places also,for where is a finer sense of what the short story can do?He wrote,in my judgment,two masterpieces in his life,and each of them is essentially a short story,though the one happened to be published as a volume.The one is“Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde，”which,whether you take it as a vivid narrative or as a wonderfully deep and true allegory,is a supremely fine bit of work.The other story of my choice would be“The Pavilion on the Links”—the very model of dramatic narrative.That story stamped itself so clearly on my brain when I read it in Cornhill that when I came across it again many years afterwards in volume form,I was able instantly to recognize two small modifications of the text—each very much for the worse—from the original form.They were small things,but they seemed somehow like a chip on a perfect statue.Surely it is only a very fine work of art which could leave so definite an impression as that.Of course,there are a dozen other of his stories which would put the average writer's best work to shame,all with the strange Stevenson glamour upon them,of which I may discourse later,but only to those two would I be disposed to admit that complete excellence which would pass them into such a team as this.

And who else?If it be not an impertinence to mention a contemporary I should certainly have a brace from Rudyard Kipling.His power,his compression,his dramatic sense,his way of glowing suddenly into a vivid flame,all mark him as a great master.But which are we to choose from that long and varied collection,many of which have claims to the highest?Speaking from memory,I should say that the stories of his which have impressed me most are“The Drums of the Fore and Aft，”“The Man who Would be King，”“The Man who Was，”and“The Brushwood Boy.”Perhaps,on the whole,it is the first two which I should choose to add to my list of masterpieces.

They are stories which invite criticism and yet defy it.The great batsman at cricket is the man who can play an unorthodox game,take every liberty which is denied to inferior players,and yet succeed brilliantly in the face of his disregard of law.So it is here.I should think the model of these stories is the most dangerous that any young writer could follow.There is digression,that most deadly fault in the short narrative；there is incoherence,there is want of proportion which makes the story stand still for pages and bound forward in a few sentences.But genius overrides all that,just as the great cricketer hooks the off ball and glides the straight one to leg.There is a dash,an exuberance,a full-blooded,confident mastery which carries everything before it.Yes,no team of immortals would be complete which did not contain at least two representatives of Kipling.

And now whom?Nathaniel Hawthorne never appealed in the highest degree to me.The fault,I am sure,is my own,but I always seemed to crave stronger fare than he gave me.It was too subtle,too elusive,for effect.Indeed,I have been more affected by some of the short work of his son Julian,though I can quite understand the high artistic claims which the senior writer has,and the delicate charm of his style.There is Bulwer-Lytton as a claimant.His“Haunted and the Haunters”is the very best ghost story that I know.As such I should include it in my list.There was a story,too,in one of the old Blachwoods—“Metempsychosis”it was called,which left so deep an impression upon my mind that I should be inclined,though it is many years since I read it,to number it with the best.Another story which has the characteristics of great work is Grant Allen's“John Creedy.”So good a story upon so philosophic a basis deserves a place among the best.There is some first-class work to be picked also from the contemporary work of Wells and of Quiller-Couch which reaches a high standard.One little sketch—“Old Aeson”in“Noughts and Crosses”—is,in my opinion,as good as anything of the kind which I have ever read.

And all this didactic talk comes from looking at that old green cover of Poe.I am sure that if I had to name the few books which have really influenced my own life I should have to put this one second only to Macaulay's Essays.I read it young when my mind was plastic.It stimulated my imagination and set before me a supreme example of dignity and force in the methods of telling a story.It is not altogether a healthy influence,perhaps.It turns the thoughts too forcibly to the morbid and the strange.

He was a saturnine creature,devoid of humor and geniality,with a love for the grotesque and the terrible.The reader must himself furnish the counteracting qualities or Poe may become a dangerous comrade.We know along what perilous tracks and into what deadly quagmires his strange mind led him,down to that gray October Sunday morning,when he was picked up,a dying man,on the sidewalk at Baltimore,at an age which should have seen him at the very prime of his strength and his manhood.

I have said that I look upon Poe as the world's supreme short story writer.His nearest rival,I should say,was Maupassant.The great Norman never rose to the extreme force and originality of the American,but he had a natural inherited power,an inborn instinct towards the right way of making his effects,which mark him as a great master.He produced stories because it was in him to do so,as naturally and as perfectly as an apple tree produces apples.What a fine,sensitive,artistic touch it is！How easily and delicately the points are made！How clear and nervous is his style,and how free from that redundancy which disfigures so much of our English work！He pares it down to the quick all the time.

I cannot write the name of Maupassant without recalling what was either a spiritual interposition or an extraordinary coincidence in my own life.I had been traveling in Switzerland and had visited,among other places,that Gemmi Pass,where a huge cliff separates a French from a German canton.On the summit of this cliff was a small inn,where we broke our journey.It was explained to us that,although the inn was inhabited all the year round,still for about three months in winter it was utterly isolated,because it could at any time only be approached by winding paths on the mountain side,and when these became obliterated by snow it was impossible either to come up or to descend.They could see the lights in the valley beneath them,but were as lonely as if they lived in the moon.So curious a situation naturally appealed to one's imagination,and I speedily began to build up a short story in my own mind,depending upon a group of strong antagonistic characters being penned up in this inn,loathing each other and yet utterly unable to get away from each other's society,every day bringing them nearer to tragedy.For a week or so,as I traveled,I was turning over the idea.

At the end of that time I returned through France.Having nothing to read I happened to buy a volume of Maupassant's Tales which I had never seen before.The first story was called“L'Auberge”（The Inn）—and as I ran my eye down the printed page I was amazed to see the two words，“Kandersteg”and“Gemmi Pass.”I settled down and read it with ever-growing amazement.The scene was laid in the inn I had visited.The plot depended on the isolation of a group of people through the snowfall.Everything that I imagined was there,save that Maupassant had brought in a savage hound.

Of course,the genesis of the thing is clear enough.He had chanced to visit the inn,and had been impressed as I had been by the same train of thought.All that is quite intelligible.But what is perfectly marvelous is that in that short journey I should have chanced to buy the one book in all the world which would prevent me from making a public fool of myself,for who would ever have believed that my work was not an imitation?I do not think that the hypothesis of coincidence can cover the facts.It is one of several incidents in my life which have convinced me of spiritual interposition—of the promptings of some beneficent force outside ourselves,which tries to help us where it can.The Old Catholic doctrine of the Guardian Angel is not only a beautiful one,but has in it,I believe,a real basis of truth.

Or is it that our subliminal ego,to use the jargon of the new psychology,or our astral,in the terms of the new theology,can learn and convey to the mind that which our own known senses are unable to apprehend?But that is too long a side track for us to turn down it.

When Maupassant chose he could run Poe close in that domain of the strange and weird which the American had made so entirely his own.Have you read Maupassant's story called“La Horla”?That is as good a bit of diablerie as you could wish for.And the Frenchman has,of course,far the broader range.He has a keen sense of humor,breaking out beyond all decorum in some of his stories,but giving a pleasant sub-flavor to all of them.And yet,when all is said,who can doubt that the austere and dreadful American is far the greater and more original mind of the two?

Talking of weird American stories,have you ever read any of the works of Ambrose Bierce?I have one of his works there，“In the Midst of Life.”This man had a flavor quite his own,and was a great artist in his way.It is not cheering reading,but it leaves its mark upon you,and that is the proof of good work.

I have often wondered where Poe got his style.There is a somber majesty about his best work,as if it were carved from polished jet,which is peculiarly his own.I dare say if I took down that volume I could light anywhere upon a paragraph which would show you what I mean.This is the kind of thing—

Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in the iron-bound melancholy volumes of the Magi.Therein,I say,are glorious histories of the heaven and of the earth,and of the mighty sea—and of the genius that overruled the sea,and the earth,and the lofty heaven.There was much lore,too,in the sayings which were said by the Sybils,and holy,holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves which trembled round Dodona,but as Allah liveth,that fable which the Demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb,I hold to be the most wonderful of all.

Or this sentence：

And then did we,the seven,start from our seats in horror,and stand trembling and aghast,for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being,but of a multitude of beings,and,varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable,fell duskily upon our ears in the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.

Is there not a sense of austere dignity?No man invents a style.It always derives back from some influence,or,as is more usual,it is a compromise between several influences.I cannot trace Poe's.And yet if Hazlitt and De Quincey had set forth to tell weird stories they might have developed something of the kind.

Now,by your leave,we will pass on to my noble edition of“The Cloister and the Hearth，”the next volume on the left.

I notice,in glancing over my rambling remarks,that I classed“Ivanhoe”as the second historical novel of the century.I dare say there are many who would give“Esmond”the first place,and I can quite understand their position,although it is not my own.I recognize the beauty of the style,the consistency of the character-drawing,the absolutely perfect Queen Anne atmosphere.There was never an historical novel written by a man who knew his period so thoroughly.But,great as these virtues are,they are not the essential in a novel.The essential in a novel is interest,though Addison unkindly remarked that the real essential was that the pastry-cooks should never run short of paper.Now“Esmond”is,in my opinion,exceedingly interesting during the campaigns in the Lowlands,and when our Machiavelian hero,the Duke,comes in,and also whenever Lord Mohun shows his ill-omened face；but there are long stretches of the story which are heavy reading.A preeminently good novel must always advance and never mark time.“Ivanhoe”never halts for an instant,and that just makes its superiority as a novel over“Esmond，”though as a piece of literature I think the latter is the more perfect.

No,if I had three votes,I should plump them all for“The Cloister and the Hearth，”as being our greatest historical novel,and,indeed,as being our greatest novel of any sort.I think I may claim to have read most of the more famous foreign novels of last century,and（speaking only for myself and within the limits of my reading）I have been more impressed by that book of Reade's and by Tolstoi's“Peace and War”than by any others.They seem to me to stand at the very top of the century's fiction.There is a certain resemblance in the two—the sense of space,the number of figures,the way in which characters drop in and drop out.The Englishman is the more romantic.The Russian is the more real and earnest.But they are both great.

Think of what Reade does in that one book.He takes the reader by the hand,and he leads him away into the Middle Ages,and not a conventional study-built Middle Age,but a period quivering with life,full of folk who are as human and real as a'bus-load in Oxford Street.He takes him through Holland,he shows him the painters,the dykes,the life.He leads him down the long line of the Rhine,the spinal marrow of Mediaeval Europe.He shows him the dawn of printing,the beginnings of freedom,the life of the great mercantile cities of South Germany,the state of Italy,the artist-life of Rome,the monastic institutions on the eve of the Reformation.And all this between the covers of one book,so naturally introduced,too,and told with such vividness and spirit.Apart from the huge scope of it,the mere study of Gerard's own nature,his rise,his fall,his regeneration,the whole pitiable tragedy at the end,make the book a great one.It contains,I think,a blending of knowledge with imagination,which makes it stand alone in our literature.Let anyone read the“Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini，”and then Charles Reade's picture of Mediaeval Roman life,if he wishes to appreciate the way in which Reade has collected his rough ore and has then smelted it all down in his fiery imagination.It is a good thing to have the industry to collect facts.It is a greater and a rarer one to have the tact to know how to use them when you have got them.To be exact without pedantry,and thorough without being dull,that should be the ideal of the writer of historical romance.

Reade is one of the most perplexing figures in our literature.Never was there a man so hard to place.At his best he is the best we have.At his worst he is below the level of Surreyside melodrama.But his best have weak pieces,and his worst have good.There is always silk among his cotton,and cotton among his silk.But,for all his flaws,the man who,in addition to the great book of which I have already spoken,wrote“It is Never Too Late to Mend，”“Hard Cash，”“Foul Play，”and“Griffith Gaunt，”must always stand in the very first rank of our novelists.

There is a quality of heart about his work which I recognize nowhere else.He so absolutely loves his own heroes and heroines,while he so cordially detests his own villains,that he sweeps your emotions along with his own.No one has ever spoken warmly enough of the humanity and the lovability of his women.It is a rare gift—very rare for a man—this power of drawing a human and delightful girl.If there is a better one in nineteenth-century fiction than Julia Dodd I have never had the pleasure of meeting her.A man who could draw a character so delicate and so delightful,and yet could write such an episode as that of the Robber Inn in“The Cloister and the Hearth，”adventurous romance in its highest form,has such a range of power as is granted to few men.My hat is always ready to come off to Charles Reade.

It is good to have the magic door shut behind us.On the other side of that door are the world and its troubles,hopes and fears,headaches and heartaches,ambitions and disappointments；but within,as you lie back on the green settee,and face the long lines of your silent soothing comrades,there is only peace of spirit and rest of mind in the company of the great dead.Learn to love,learn to admire them；learn to know what their comradeship means；for until you have done so the greatest solace and anodyne God has given man have not yet shed their blessing upon you.Here behind this magic door is the rest house,where you may forget the past,enjoy the present,and prepare for the future.

You who have sat with me before upon the green settee are familiar with the upper shelf,with the tattered Macaulay,the dapper Gibbon,the drab Boswell,the olive-green Scott,the pied Borrow,and all the goodly company who rub shoulders yonder.By the way,how one wishes that one's dear friends would only be friends also with each other.Why should Borrow snarl so churlishly at Scott?One would have thought that noble spirit and romantic fancy would have charmed the huge vagrant,and yet there is no word too bitter for the younger man to use towards the elder.The fact is that Borrow had one dangerous virus in him—a poison which distorts the whole vision—for he was a bigoted sectarian in religion,seeing no virtue outside his own interpretation of the great riddle.Downright heathendom,the blood-stained Berserk or the chanting Druid,appealed to his mind through his imagination,but the man of his own creed and time who differed from him in minutiae of ritual,or in the interpretation of mystic passages,was at once evil to the bone,and he had no charity of any sort for such a person.Scott therefore,with his reverent regard for old usages,became at once hateful in his eyes.In any case he was a disappointed man,the big Borrow,and I cannot remember that he ever had much to say that was good of any brother author.Only in the bards of Wales and in the Scalds of the Sagas did he seem to find his kindred spirits,though it has been suggested that his complex nature took this means of informing the world that he could read both Cymric and Norse.But we must not be unkind behind the magic door—and yet to be charitable to the uncharitable is surely the crown of virtue.

So much for the top line,concerning which I have already gossiped for six sittings,but there is no surcease for you,reader,for as you see there is a second line,and yet a third,all equally dear to my heart,and all appealing in the same degree to my emotions and to my memory.Be as patient as you may,while I talk of these old friends,and tell you why I love them,and all that they have meant to me in the past.If you picked any book from that line you would be picking a little fiber also from my mind,very small,no doubt,and yet an intimate and essential part of what is now myself.Hereditary impulses,personal experiences,books—those are the three forces which go to the making of man.These are the books.

This second line consists,as you see,of novelists of the eighteenth century,or those of them whom I regard as essential.After all,putting aside single books,such as Sterne's“Tristram Shandy，”Goldsmith's“Vicar of Wakefield，”and Miss Burney's“Evelina，”there are only three authors who count,and they in turn wrote only three books each,of first-rate importance,so that by the mastery of nine books one might claim to have a fairly broad view of this most important and distinctive branch of English literature.The three men are,of course,Fielding,Richardson,and Smollett.The books are：Richardson's“Clarissa Harlowe，”“Pamela，”and“Sir Charles Grandison”；Fielding's“Tom Jones，”“Joseph Andrews，”and“Amelia”；Smollett’s“Peregrine Pickle，”“Humphrey Clinker，”and“Roderick Random.”There we have the real work of the three great contemporaries who illuminated the middle of the eighteenth century—only nine volumes in all.Let us walk around these nine volumes,therefore,and see whether we cannot discriminate and throw a little light,after this interval of a hundred and fifty years,upon their comparative aims,and how far they have justified them by the permanent value of their work.A fat little bookseller in the City,a rakehell wit of noble blood,and a rugged Scotch surgeon from the navy—those are the three strange immortals who now challenge a comparison—the three men who dominate the fiction of their century,and to whom we owe it that the life and the types of that century are familiar to us,their fifth generation.

It is not a subject to be dogmatic upon,for I can imagine that these three writers would appeal quite differently to every temperament,and that whichever one might desire to champion one could find arguments to sustain one's choice.Yet I cannot think that any large section of the critical public could maintain that Smollett was on the same level as the other two.Ethically he is gross,though his grossness is accompanied by a full-blooded humor which is more mirth-compelling than the more polished wit of his rivals.I can remember in callow boyhood—puris omnia pura—reading“Peregrine Pickle，”and laughing until I cried over the Banquet in the Fashion of the Ancients.I read it again in my manhood with the same effect,though with a greater appreciation of its inherent bestiality.That merit,a gross primitive merit,he has in a high degree,but in no other respect can he challenge comparison with either Fielding or Richardson.His view of life is far more limited,his characters less varied,his incidents less distinctive,and his thoughts less deep.Assuredly I,for one,should award him the third place in the trio.

But how about Richardson and Fielding?There is indeed a competition of giants.Let us take the points of each in turn,and then compare them with each other.

There is one characteristic,the rarest and subtlest of all,which each of them had in a supreme degree.Each could draw the most delightful women—the most perfect women,I think,in the whole range of our literature.If the eighteenth-century women were like that,then the eighteenth-century men got a great deal more than they ever deserved.They had such a charming little dignity of their own,such good sense,and yet such dear,pretty dainty ways,so human and so charming,that even now they become our ideals.One cannot come to know them without a double emotion,one of respectful devotion towards themselves,and the other of abhorrence for the herd of swine who surrounded them.Pamela,Harriet Byron,Clarissa,Amelia,and Sophia Western were all equally delightful,and it was not the negative charm of the innocent and colorless woman,the amiable doll of the nineteenth century,but it was a beauty of nature depending upon an alert mind,clear and strong principles,true womanly feelings,and complete feminine charm.In this respect our rival authors may claim a tie,for I could not give a preference to one set of these perfect creatures over another.The plump little printer and the worn-out man-about-town had each a supreme woman in his mind.

But their men！Alas,what a drop is there！To say that we are all capable of doing what Tom Jones did—as I have seen stated—is the worst form of inverted cant,the cant which makes us out worse than we are.It is a libel on mankind to say that a man who truly loves a woman is usually false to her,and,above all,a libel that he should be false in the vile fashion which aroused good Tom Newcome's indignation.Tom Jones was no more fit to touch the hem of Sophia's dress than Captain Booth was to be the mate of Amelia.Never once has Fielding drawn a gentleman,save perhaps Squire Alworthy.A lusty,brawling,good-hearted,material creature was the best that he could fashion.Where,in his heroes,is there one touch of distinction,of spirituality,of nobility?Here I think that the plebeian printer has done very much better than the aristocrat.Sir Charles Grandison is a very noble type—spoiled a little by over-coddling on the part of his creator perhaps,but a very high-souled and exquisite gentleman all the same.Had he married Sophia or Amelia I should not have forbidden the banns.Even the persevering Mr.B—and the too amorous Lovelace were,in spite of their aberrations,men of gentle nature,and had possibilities of greatness and tenderness within them.Yes,I cannot doubt that Richardson drew the higher type of man—and that in Grandison he has done what has seldom or never been bettered.

Richardson was also the subtler and deeper writer in my opinion.He concerns himself with fine consistent character-drawing,and with a very searching analysis of the human heart,which is done so easily,and in such simple English,that the depth and truth of it only come upon reflection.He condescends to none of those scuffles and buffetings and pantomime rallies which enliven,but cheapen,many of Fielding's pages.The latter has,it may be granted,a broader view of life.He had personal acquaintance of circles far above,and also far below,any which the douce citizen,who was his rival,had ever been able or willing to explore.His pictures of low London life,the prison scenes in“Amelia，”the thieves'kitchens in“Jonathan Wild，”the sponging houses and the slums are as vivid and as complete as those of his friend Hogarth—the most British of artists,even as Fielding was the most British of writers.But the greatest and most permanent facts of life are to be found in the smallest circles.Two men and a woman may furnish either the tragedian or the comedian with the most satisfying theme.And so,although his range was limited,Richardson knew very clearly and very thoroughly just that knowledge which was essential for his purpose.Pamela,the perfect woman of humble life,Clarissa the perfect lady,Grandison the ideal gentleman—these were the three figures on which he lavished his most loving art.And now,after one hundred and fifty years,I do not know where we may find more satisfying types.

He was prolix,it may be admitted,but who could bear to have him cut?He loved to sit down and tell you just all about it.His use of letters for his narratives made this gossipy style more easy.First he writes and he tells all that passed.You have his letter.She at the same time writes to her friend,and also states her views.This also you see.The friends in each case reply,and you have the advantage of their comments and advice.You really do know all about it before you finish.It may be a little wearisome at first,if you have been accustomed to a more hustling style with fireworks in every chapter.But gradually it creates an atmosphere in which you live,and you come to know these people,with their characters and their troubles,as you know no others of the dream-folk fiction.Three times as long as an ordinary book no doubt,but why grudge the time?What is the hurry?Surely it is better to read one masterpiece than three books which will leave no permanent impression on the mind.

It was all attuned to the sedate life of that,the last of the quiet centuries.In the lonely country-house,with few letters and fewer papers,do you suppose that the readers ever complained of the length of a book,or could have too much of the happy Pamela or of the unhappy Clarissa?It is only under extraordinary circumstances that one can now get into that receptive frame of mind which was normal then.Such an occasion is recorded by Macaulay,when he tells how in some Indian hill station,where books were rare,he let loose a copy of“Clarissa.”The effect was what might have been expected.Richardson in a suitable environment went through the community like a mild fever.They lived him,and dreamed him,until the whole episode passed into literary history,never to be forgotten by those who experienced it.It is tuned for every ear.That beautiful style is so correct and yet so simple that there is no page which a scholar may not applaud nor a servant-maid understand.

Of course,there are obvious disadvantages to the tale which is told in letters.Scott reverted to it in“Guy Mannering，”and there are other conspicuous successes,but vividness is always gained at the expense of a strain upon the reader's good-nature and credulity.One feels that these constant details,these long conversations,could not possibly have been recorded in such a fashion.The indignant and dishevelled heroine could not sit down and record her escape with such cool minuteness of description.Richardson does it as well as it could be done,but it remains intrinsically faulty.Fielding,using the third person,broke all the fetters which bound his rival,and gave a freedom and personal authority to the novel which it had never before enjoyed.There at least he is the master.

And yet,on the whole,my balance inclines towards Richardson,though I dare say I am one in a hundred in thinking so.First of all,beyond anything I may have already urged,he had the supreme credit of having been the first.Surely the originator should have a higher place than the imitator,even if in imitating he should also improve and amplify.It is Richardson and not Fielding who is the father of the English novel,the man who first saw that without romantic gallantry,and without bizarre imaginings,enthralling stories may be made from everyday life,told in everyday language.This was his great new departure.So entirely was Fielding his imitator,or rather perhaps his parodist,that with supreme audacity（some would say brazen impudence）he used poor Richardson's own characters,taken from“Pamela”in his own first novel，“Joseph Andrews，”and used them too for the unkind purpose of ridiculing them.As a matter of literary ethics,it is as if Thackeray wrote a novel bringing in Pickwick and Sam Weller in order to show what faulty characters these were.It is no wonder that even the gentle little printer grew wrath,and alluded to his rival as a somewhat unscrupulous man.

And then there is the vexed question of morals.Surely in talking of this also,there is a good deal of inverted cant among a certain class of critics.The inference appears to be that there is some subtle connection between immorality and art,as if the handling of the lewd,or the depicting of it,were in some sort the hallmark of the true artist.It is not difficult to handle or depict.On the contrary,it is so easy,and so essentially dramatic in many of its forms,that the temptation to employ it is ever present.It is the easiest and cheapest of all methods of creating a spurious effect.The difficulty does not lie in doing it.The difficulty lies in avoiding it.But one tries to avoid it because on the face of it there is no reason why a writer should cease to be a gentleman,or that he should write for a woman's eyes that which he would be justly knocked down for having said in a woman's ears.But“you must draw the world as it is.”Why must you?Surely it is just in selection and restraint that the artist is shown.It is true that in a coarser age great writers heeded no restrictions,but life itself had fewer restrictions then.We are of our own age,and must live up to it.

But must these sides of life be absolutely excluded?By no means.Our decency need not weaken into prudery.It all lies in the spirit in which it is done.No one who wished to lecture on these various spirits could preach on a better text than these three great rivals,Richardson,Fielding,and Smollett.It is possible to draw vice with some freedom for the purpose of condemning it.Such a writer is a moralist,and there is no better example than Richardson.Again,it is possible to draw vice with neither sympathy nor disapprobation,but simply as a fact which is there.Such a writer is a realist,and such was Fielding.Once more,it is possible to draw vice in order to extract amusement from it.Such a man is a coarse humorist,and such was Smollett.Lastly,it is possible to draw vice in order to show sympathy with it.Such a man is a wicked man,and there were many among the writers of the Restoration.But of all reasons that exist for treating this side of life,Richardson's were the best,and nowhere do we find it more deftly done.

Apart from his writings,there must have been something very noble about Fielding as a man.He was a better hero than any that he drew.Alone he accepted the task of cleansing London,at that time the most dangerous and lawless of European capitals.Hogarth's pictures give some notion of it in the pre-Fielding day,the low roughs,the high-born bullies,the drunkenness,the villainies,the thieves'kitchens with their riverside trapdoors,down which the body is thrust.This was the Augean stable which had to be cleaned,and poor Hercules was weak and frail and physically more fitted for a sick-room than for such a task.It cost him his life,for he died at 47，worn out with his own exertions.It might well have cost him his life in more dramatic fashion,for he had become a marked man to the criminal classes,and he headed his own search-parties,when,on the information of some bribed rascal,a new den of villainy was exposed.But he carried his point.In little more than a year the thing was done,and London turned from the most rowdy to what it has ever since remained,the most law-abiding of European capitals.Has any man ever left a finer monument behind him?

If you want the real human Fielding you will find him not in the novels,where his real kindliness is too often veiled by a mock cynicism,but in his“Diary of his Voyage to Lisbon.”He knew that his health was irretrievably ruined and that his years were numbered.Those are the days when one sees a man as he is,when he has no longer a motive for affectation or pretense in the immediate presence of the most tremendous of all realities.Yet,sitting in the shadow of death,Fielding displayed a quiet,gentle courage and constancy of mind,which show how splendid a nature had been shrouded by his earlier frailties.

Just one word upon another eighteenth-century novel before I finish this somewhat didactic chat.You will admit that I have never prosed so much before,but the period and the subject seem to encourage it.I skip Sterne,for I have no great sympathy with his finicky methods.And I skip Miss Burney's novels,as being feminine reflections of the great masters who had just preceded her.But Goldsmith's“Vicar of Wakefield”surely deserves one paragraph to itself.There is a book which is tinged throughout,as was all Goldsmith's work,with a beautiful nature.No one who had not a fine heart could have written it,just as no one without a fine heart could have written“The Deserted Village.”How strange it is to think of old Johnson patronizing or snubbing the shrinking Irishman,when both in poetry,in fiction,and in the drama the latter has proved himself far the greater man.But here is an object-lesson of how the facts of life may be treated without offense.Nothing is shirked.It is all faced and duly recorded.Yet if I wished to set before the sensitive mind of a young girl a book which would prepare her for life without in any way contaminating her delicacy of feeling,there is no book which I should choose so readily as“The Vicar of Wakefield.”

So much for the eighteenth-century-novelists.They have a shelf of their own in the case,and a corner of their own in my brain.For years you may never think of them,and then suddenly some stray word or train of thought leads straight to them,and you look at them and love them,and rejoice that you know them.But let us pass to something which may interest you more.

If statistics could be taken in the various free libraries of the kingdom to prove the comparative popularity of different novelists with the public,I think that it is quite certain that Mr.George Meredith would come out very low indeed.If,on the other hand,a number of authors were convened to determine which of their fellow-craftsmen they considered the greatest and the most stimulating to their own minds,I am equally confident that Mr.Meredith would have a vast preponderance of votes.Indeed,his only conceivable rival would be Mr.Hardy.It becomes an interesting study,therefore,why there should be such a divergence of opinion as to his merits,and what the qualities are which have repelled so many readers,and yet have attracted those whose opinion must be allowed to have a special weight.

The most obvious reason is his complete unconventionality.The public read to be amused.The novelist reads to have new light thrown upon his art.To read Meredith is not a mere amusement；it is an intellectual exercise,a kind of mental dumb-bell with which you develop your thinking powers.Your mind is in a state of tension the whole time that you are reading him.

If you will follow my nose as the sportsman follows that of his pointer,you will observe that these remarks are excited by the presence of my beloved“Richard Feverel，”which lurks in yonder corner.What a great book it is,how wise and how witty！Others of the master's novels may be more characteristic or more profound,but for my own part it is the one which I would always present to the new-comer who had not yet come under the influence.I think that I should put it third after“Vanity Fair”and“The Cloister and the Hearth”if I had to name the three novels which I admire most in the Victorian era.The book was published,I believe,in 1859，and it is almost incredible,and says little for the discrimination of critics or public,that it was nearly twenty years before a second edition was needed.

But there are never effects without causes,however inadequate the cause may be.What was it that stood in the way of the book's success?Undoubtedly it was the style.And yet it is subdued and tempered here with little of the luxuriance and exuberance which it attained in the later works.But it was an innovation,and it stalled off both the public and the critics.They regarded it,no doubt,as an affectation,as Carlyle's had been considered twenty years before,forgetting that in the case of an original genius style is an organic thing,part of the man as much as the color of his eyes.It is not,to quote Carlyle,a shirt to be taken on and off at pleasure,but a skin,eternally fixed.And this strange,powerful style,how is it to be described?Best,perhaps,in his own strong words,when he spoke of Carlyle with perhaps the arrière pensée that the words would apply as strongly to himself.

“His favorite author，”says he，“was one writing on heroes in a style resembling either early architecture or utter dilapidation,so loose and rough it seemed.A wind-in-the-orchard style that tumbled down here and there an appreciable fruit with uncouth bluster,sentences without commencements running to abrupt endings and smoke,like waves against a sea-wall,learned dictionary words giving a hand to street slang,and accents falling on them haphazard,like slant rays from driving clouds；all the pages in a breeze,the whole book producing a kind of electrical agitation in the mind and joints.”

What a wonderful description and example of style！And how vivid is the impression left by such expressions as“all the pages in a breeze.”As a comment on Carlyle,and as a sample of Meredith,the passage is equally perfect.

Well，“Richard Feverel”has come into its own at last.I confess to having a strong belief in the critical discernment of the public.I do not think good work is often overlooked.Literature,like water,finds its true level.Opinion is slow to form,but it sets true at last.I am sure that if the critics were to unite to praise a bad book or to damn a good one they could（and continually do）have a five-year influence,but it would in no wise affect the final result.Sheridan said that if all the fleas in his bed had been unanimous,they could have pushed him out of it.I do not think that any unanimity of critics has ever pushed a good book out of literature.

Among the minor excellences of“Richard Feverel”—excuse the prolixity of an enthusiast—are the scattered aphorisms which are worthy of a place among our British proverbs.What could be more exquisite than this，“Who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered”；or this，“Expediency is man's wisdom.Doing right is God's”；or，“All great thoughts come from the heart”?Good are the words“The coward amongst us is he who sneers at the failings of humanity，”and a healthy optimism rings in the phrase“There is for the mind but one grasp of happiness；from that uppermost pinnacle of wisdom whence we see that this world is well designed.”In more playful mood is“Woman is the last thing which will be civilized by man.”Let us hurry away abruptly,for he who starts quotation from“Richard Feverel”is lost.

He has,as you see,a goodly line of his brothers beside him.There are the Italian ones，“Sandra Belloni，”and“Vittoria”；there is“Rhoda Fleming，”which carried Stevenson off his critical feet；“Beauchamp's Career，”too,dealing with obsolete politics.No great writer should spend himself upon a temporary theme.It is like the beauty who is painted in some passing fashion of gown.She tends to become obsolete along with her frame.Here also is the dainty“Diana，”the egoist with immortal Willoughby Pattern,eternal type of masculine selfishness,and“Harry Richmond，”the first chapters of which are,in my opinion,among the finest pieces of narrative prose in the language.That great mind would have worked in any form which his age had favored.He is a novelist by accident.As an Elizabethan he would have been a great dramatist；under Queen Anne a great essayist.But whatever medium he worked in,he must equally have thrown the image of a great brain and a great soul.





VIII


We have left our eighteenth-century novelists—Fielding,Richardson,and Smollett—safely behind us,with all their solidity and their audacity,their sincerity,and their coarseness of fiber.They have brought us,as you perceive,to the end of the shelf.What,not wearied?Ready for yet another?Let us run down this next row,then,and I will tell you a few things which may be of interest,though they will be dull enough if you have not been born with that love of books in your heart which is among the choicest gifts of the gods.If that is wanting,then one might as well play music to the deaf,or walk round the Academy with the color-blind,as appeal to the book-sense of an unfortunate who has it not.

There is this old brown volume in the corner.How it got there I cannot imagine,for it is one of those which I bought for threepence out of the remnant box in Edinburgh,and its weather-beaten comrades are up yonder in the back gallery,while this one has elbowed its way among the quality in the stalls.But it is worth a word or two.Take it out and handle it！See how swarthy it is,how squat,with how bullet-proof a cover of scaling leather.Now open the flyleaf“Ex libris Guilielmi Whyte.1672”in faded yellow ink.I wonder who William Whyte may have been,and what he did upon earth in the reign of the merry monarch.A pragmatical seventeenth-century lawyer,I should judge,by that hard,angular writing.The date of issue is 1642，so it was printed just about the time when the Pilgrim Fathers were settling down into their new American home,and the first Charles's head was still firm upon his shoulders,though a little puzzled,no doubt,at what was going around it.The book is in Latin—though Cicero might not have admitted it—and it treats of the laws of warfare.

I picture some pedantic Dugald Dalgetty bearing it about under his buff coat,or down in his holster,and turning up the reference for every fresh emergency which occurred.“Hullo！here's a well！”says he.“I wonder if I may poison it?”Out comes the book,and he runs a dirty forefinger down the index.“Ob fas est aquam hostis venere”etc.“Tut,tut,it's not allowed.But here are some of the enemy in a barn?What about that?”“Ob fas est hostem incendio，”etc.“Yes；he says we may.Quick,Ambrose,up with the straw and the tinder box.”Warfare was no child's play about the time when Tilly sacked Magdeburg,and Cromwell turned his hand from the mash tub to the sword.It might not be much better now in a long campaign,when men were hardened and embittered.Many of these laws are unrepealed,and it is less than a century since highly disciplined British troops claimed their dreadful rights at Badajos and Rodrigo.Recent European wars have been so short that discipline and humanity have not had time to go to pieces,but a long war would show that man is ever the same,and that civilization is the thinnest of veneers.

Now you see that whole row of books which takes you at one sweep nearly across the shelf?I am rather proud of those,for they are my collection of Napoleonic military memoirs.There is a story told of an illiterate millionaire who gave a wholesale dealer an order for a copy of all books in any language treating of any aspect of Napoleon's career.He thought it would fill a case in his library.He was somewhat taken aback,however,when in a few weeks he received a message from the dealer that he had got 40，000 volumes,and awaited instructions as to whether he should send them on as an instalment,or wait for a complete set.The figures may not be exact,but at least they bring home the impossibility of exhausting the subject,and the danger of losing one's self for years in a huge labyrinth of reading,which may end by leaving no very definite impression upon your mind.But one might,perhaps,take a corner of it,as I have done here in the military memoirs,and there one might hope to get some finality.

Here is Marbot at this end—the first of all soldier books in the world.This is the complete three-volume French edition,with red and gold cover,smart and débonnaire like its author.Here he is in one frontispiece with his pleasant,round,boyish face,as a Captain of his beloved Chasseurs.And here in the other is the grizzled old bull-dog as a full general,looking as full of fight as ever.It was a real blow to me when some one began to throw doubts upon the authenticity of Marbot’s memoirs.Homer may be dissolved into a crowd of skin-clad bards.Even Shakespeare may be jostled in his throne of honor by plausible Baconians；but the human,the gallant,the inimitable Marbot！His book is that which gives us the best picture by far of the Napoleonic soldiers,and to me they are even more interesting than their great leader,though his must ever be the most singular figure in history.But those soldiers,with their hugh shakoes,their hairy knapsacks,and their hearts of steel—what men they were！And what a latent power there must be in this French nation which could go on pouring out the blood of its sons for twenty-three years with hardly a pause！

It took all that time to work off the hot ferment which the Revolution had left in men's veins.And they were not exhausted,for the very last fight which the French fought was the finest of all.Proud as we are of our infantry at Waterloo,it was really with the French cavalry that the greenest laurels of that great epic rested.They got the better of our own cavalry,they took our guns again and again,they swept a large portion of our allies from the field,and finally they rode off unbroken,and as full of fight as ever.Read Gronow's“Memoirs，”that chatty little yellow volume yonder which brings all that age back to us more vividly than any more pretentious work,and you will find the chivalrous admiration which our officers expressed at the fine performance of the French horsemen.

It must be admitted that,looking back upon history,we have not always been good allies,nor yet generous,co-partners in the battlefield.The first is the fault of our politics,where one party rejoices to break what the other has bound.The makers of the Treaty are staunch enough,as the Tories were under Pitt and Castlereagh,or the Whigs at the time of Queen Anne,but sooner or later the others must come in.At the end of the Marlborough wars we suddenly vamped up a peace and left our allies in the lurch,on account of a change in domestic politics.We did the same with Frederick the Great,and would have done it in the Napoleonic days if Fox could have controlled the country.And as to our partners of the battlefield,how little we have ever said that is hearty as to the splendid staunchness of the Prussians at Waterloo.You have to read the Frenchman,Houssaye,to get a central view and to understand the part they played.Think of old Blucher,seventy years old,and ridden over by a regiment of charging cavalry the day before,yet swearing that he would come to Wellington if he had to be strapped to his horse.He nobly redeemed his promise.

The loss of the Prussians at Waterloo was not far short of our own.You would not know it,to read our historians.And then the abuse of our Belgian allies has been overdone.Some of them fought splendidly,and one brigade of infantry had a share in the critical instant when the battle was turned.This also you would not learn from British sources.Look at our Portuguese allies also！They trained into magnificent troops,and one of Wellington's earnest desires was to have ten thousand of them for his Waterloo campaign.It was a Portuguese who first topped the rampart of Badajos.They have never had their due credit,nor have the Spaniards either,for,though often defeated,it was their unconquerable pertinacity which played a great part in the struggle.No；I do not think that we are very amiable partners,but I suppose that all national history may be open to a similar charge.

It must be confessed that Marbot's details are occasionally a little hard to believe.Never in the pages of Lever has there been such a series of hairbreadth escapes and dare-devil exploits.Surely he stretched it a little sometimes.You may remember his adventure at Eylau—I think it was Eylau—how a cannonball,striking the top of his helmet,paralyzed him by the concussion of his spine；and how,on a Russian officer running forward to cut him down,his horse bit the man's face nearly off.This was the famous charger which savaged everything until Marbot,having bought it for next to nothing,cured it by thrusting a boiling leg of mutton into its mouth when it tried to bite him.It certainly does need a robust faith to get over these incidents.And yet,when one reflects upon the hundreds of battles and skirmishes which a Napoleonic officer must have endured—how they must have been the uninterrupted routine of his life from the first dark hair upon his lip to the first gray one upon his head,it is presumptuous to say what may or may not have been possible in such unparalleled careers.At any rate,be it fact or fiction—fact it is,in my opinion,with some artistic touching up of the high lights—there are few books which I could not spare from my shelves better than the memoirs of the gallant Marbot.

I dwell upon this particular book because it is the best；but take the whole line,and there is not one which is not full of interest.Marbot gives you the point of view of the officer.So does De Ségfur and De Fezensac and Colonel Gonville,each in some different branch of the service.But some are from the pens of the men in the ranks,and they are even more graphic than the others.Here,for example,are the papers of good old Cogniet,who was a grenadier of the Guard,and could neither read nor write until after the great wars were over.A tougher soldier never went into battle.Here is Sergeant Bourgogne,also with his dreadful account of that nightmare campaign in Russia,and the gallant Chevillet,trumpeter of Chasseurs,with his matter-of-fact account of all that he saw,where the daily“combat”is sandwiched in betwixt the real business of the day,which was foraging for his frugal breakfast and supper.There is no better writing,and no easier reading,than the records of these men of action.

A Briton cannot help asking himself,as he realizes what men these were,what would have happened if 150，000 Cogniets and Bourgognes,with Marbots to lead them,and the great captain of all time in the prime of his vigor at their head,had made their landing in Kent?For months it was touch-and-go.A single naval slip which left the Channel clear would have been followed by an embarkation from Boulogne,which had been brought by constant practice to so incredibly fine a point that the last horse was aboard within two hours of the start.Any evening might have seen the whole host upon the Pevensey Flats.What then?We know what Humbert did with a handful of men in Ireland,and the story is not reassuring.Conquest,of course,is unthinkable.The world in arms could not do that.But Napoleon never thought of the conquest of Britain.He has expressly disclaimed it.What he did contemplate was a gigantic raid in which he would do so much damage that for years to come England would be occupied at home in picking up the pieces,instead of having energy to spend abroad in thwarting his Continental plans.

Portsmouth,Plymouth,and Sheerness in flames,with London either leveled to the ground,or ransomed at his own figure—that was a more feasible programme.Then,with the united fleets of conquered Europe at his back,enormous armies and an inexhaustible treasury,swollen with the ransom of Britain,he could turn to that conquest of America which would win back the old colonies of France and leave him master of the world.If the worst happened and he had met his Waterloo upon the South Downs,he would have done again what he did in Egypt and once more in Russia：hurried back to France in a swift vessel,and still have force enough to hold his own upon the Continent.It would,no doubt,have been a big stake to lay upon the table—150，000 of his best—but he could play again if he lost；while,if he won,he cleared the board.A fine game—if little Nelson had not stopped it,and with one blow fixed the edge of salt water as the limit of Napoleon's power.

There's the cast of a medal on the top of that cabinet which will bring it all close home to you.It is taken from the die of the medal which Napoleon had arranged to issue on the day that he reached London.It serves,at any rate,to show that his great muster was not a bluff,but that he really did mean serious business.On one side is his head.On the other France is engaged in strangling and throwing to earth a curious fish-tailed creature,which stands for perfidious Albion.“Frappé à Londres”is printed on one part of it,and“La Descente dans Angleterre”upon another.Struck to commemorate a conquest,it remains now as a souvenir of a fiasco.But it was a close call.

By the way,talking of Napoleon's flight from Egypt,did you ever see a curious little book called,if I remember right，“Intercepted Letters?”No；I have no copy upon this shelf,but a friend is more fortunate.It shows the almost incredible hatred which existed at the end of the eighteenth century between the two nations,descending even to the most petty personal annoyance.On this occasion the British Government intercepted a mail-bag of letters coming from French officers in Egypt to their friends at home,and they either published them,or at least allowed them to be published,in the hope,no doubt,of causing domestic complications.Was ever a more despicable action?But who knows what other injuries had been inflicted to draw forth such a retaliation?I have myself seen a burned and mutilated British mail lying where De Wet had left it；but suppose the refinement of his vengeance had gone so far as to publish it,what a thunder-bolt it might have been！

As to the French officers,I have read their letters,though even after a century one had a feeling of guilt when one did so.But,on the whole,they are a credit to the writers,and give the impression of a noble and chivalrous set of men.Whether they were all addressed to the right people is another matter,and therein lay the poisoned sting of this most un-British affair.As to the monstrous things which were done upon the other side,remember the arrest of all the poor British tourists and commercials who chanced to be in France when the war was renewed in 1803.They had run over in all trust and confidence for a little outing and change of air.They certainly got it,for Napoleon's steel grip fell upon them and they rejoined their families in 1814.He must have had a heart of adamant and a will of iron.Look at his conduct over the naval prisoners.The natural proceeding would have been to exchange them.For some reason he did not think it good policy to do so.All representations from the British Government were set aside,save in the case of the higher officers.Hence the miseries of the hulks and the dreadful prison barracks in England.Hence also the unhappy idlers of Verdun.What splendid loyalty there must have been in those humble Frenchmen which never allowed them for one instant to turn bitterly upon the author of all their great misfortunes.It is all brought vividly home by the description of their prisons given by Borrow in“Lavengro.”This is the passage—

What a strange appearance had those mighty casernes,with their blank,blind walls,without windows or grating,and their slanting roofs,out of which,through orifices where the tiles had been removed,would be protruded dozens of grim heads,feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide expanse of country unfolded from their airy height.Ah！there was much misery in those casernes；and from those roofs,doubtless,many a wistful

look was turned in the direction of lovely France.Much had the poor inmates to endure,and much to complain of,to the disgrace of England be it said—of England,in general so kind and bountiful.Rations of carrion meat,and bread from which I have seen the very hounds occasionally turn away,were unworthy entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy,when helpless and captive；and such,alas！was the fare in those casernes.And then,those visits,or rather ruthless inroads,called in the slang of the place“straw-plait hunts，”when in pursuit of a contraband article,which the prisoners,in order to procure themselves a few of the necessaries and comforts of existence,were in the habit of making,red-coated battalions were marched into the prisons,who,with the bayonet’s point,carried havoc and ruin into every poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had been endeavoring to raise around it；and then the triumphant exit with the miserable booty,and worst of all,the accursed bonfire,on the barrack parade of the plait contraband,beneath the view of glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs,amid the hurrahs of the troops frequently drowned in the curses poured down from above like a tempest-shower,or in the terrific war-whoop of“Vive l’Empereur！”

There is a little vignette of Napoleon's men in captivity.Here is another which is worth preserving of the bearing of his veterans when wounded on the field of battle.It is from Mercer's recollections of the Battle of Waterloo.Mercer had spent the day firing case into the French cavalry at ranges from fifty to two hundred yards,losing two-thirds of his own battery in the process.In the evening he had a look at some of his own grim handiwork.

I had satisfied my curiosity at Hougoumont,and was retracing my steps up the hill when my attention was called to a group of wounded Frenchmen by the calm,dignified,and soldier-like oration addressed by one of them to the rest.I cannot,like Livy,compose a fine harangue for my hero,and,of course,I could not retain the precise words,but the import of them was to exhort them to bear their sufferings with fortitude；not to repine,like women or children,at what every soldier should have made up his mind to suffer as the fortune of war,but above all,to remember that they were surrounded by Englishmen,before whom they ought to be doubly careful not to disgrace themselves by displaying such an unsoldier-like want of fortitude.

The speaker was sitting on the ground with his

lance stuck upright beside him—an old veteran with thick bushy,grizzly beard,countenance like a lion—a lancer of the old guard,and no doubt had fought in many a field.One hand was flourished in the air as he spoke,the other,severed at the wrist,lay on the earth beside him；one ball（case-shot,probably）had entered his body,another had broken his leg.His suffering,after a night of exposure so mangled,must have been great；yet he betrayed it not.His bearing was that of a Roman,or perhaps an Indian warrior,and I could fancy him concluding appropriately his speech in the words of the Mexican king，“And I too；am I on a bed of roses?”

What a load of moral responsibility upon one man！But his mind was insensible to moral responsibility.Surely if it had not been it must have been crushed beneath it.Now,if you want to understand the character of Napoleon—but surely I must take a fresh start before I launch on so portentous a subject as that.

But before I leave the military men let me,for the credit of my own country,after that infamous incident of the letters,indicate these six well-thumbed volumes of“Napier's History.”This is the story of the great Peninsular War,by one who fought through it himself,and in no history has a more chivalrous and manly account been given of one's enemy.Indeed,Napier seems to me to push it too far,for his admiration appears to extend not only to the gallant soldiers who opposed him,but to the character and to the ultimate aims of their leader.He was,in fact,a political follower of Charles James Fox,and his heart seems to have been with the enemy even at the moment when he led his men most desperately against them.In the verdict of history the action of those men who,in their honest zeal for freedom,inflamed somewhat by political strife,turned against their own country,when it was in truth the Champion of Freedom,and approved of a military despot of the most uncompromising kind,seems wildly foolish.

But if Napier's politics may seem strange,his soldiering was splendid,and his prose among the very best that I know.There are passages in that work—the one which describes the breach of Badajos,that of the charge of the Fusiliers at Albuera,and that of the French advance at Fuentes d'Onoro—which once read haunt the mind for ever.The book is a worthy monument of a great national epic.Alas！for the pregnant sentence with which it closes，“So ended the great war,and with it all memory of the services of the veterans.”Was there ever a British war of which the same might not have been written?

The quotation which I have given from Mercer's book turns my thoughts in the direction of the British military reminiscences of that period,less numerous,less varied,and less central than the French,but full of character and interest all the same.I have found that if I am turned loose in a large library,after hesitating over covers for half an hour or so,it is usually a book of soldier memoirs which I take down.Man is never so interesting as when he is thoroughly in earnest,and no one is so earnest as he whose life is at stake upon the event.But of all types of soldier the best is the man who is keen upon his work,and yet has general culture which enables him to see that work in its due perspective,and to sympathize with the gentler aspirations of mankind.Such a man is Mercer,an ice-cool fighter,with a sense of discipline and decorum which prevented him from moving when a bombshell was fizzing between his feet,and yet a man of thoughtful and philosophic temperament,with a weakness for solitary musings,for children,and for flowers.He has written for all time the classic account of a great battle,seen from the point of view of a battery commander.Many others of Wellington's soldiers wrote their personal reminiscences.You can get them,as I have them there,in the pleasant abridgment of“Wellington's Men”（admirably edited by Dr.Fitchett）—Anton the Highlander,Harris the rifleman,and Kincaid of the same corps.It is a most singular fate which has made an Australian nonconformist clergyman the most sympathetic and eloquent reconstructor of those old heroes,but it is a noble example of that unity of the British race,which in fifty scattered lands still mourns or rejoices over the same historic record.

And just one word,before I close down this over-long and too discursive chatter,on the subject of yonder twin red volumes which flank the shelf.They are Maxwell's“History of Wellington，”and I do not think you will find a better or more readable one.The reader must ever feel towards the great soldier what his own immediate followers felt,respect rather than affection.One's failure to attain a more affectionate emotion is alleviated by the knowledge that it was the last thing which he invited or desired.“Don't be a damned fool,sir！”was his exhortation to the good citizen who had paid him a compliment.It was a curious,callous nature,brusque and limited.The hardest huntsman learns to love his hounds,but he showed no affection and a good deal of contempt for the men who had been his instruments.“They are the scum of the earth，”said he.“All English soldiers are fellows who have enlisted for drink.That is the plain fact—they have all enlisted for drink.”His general orders were full of undeserved reproaches at a time when the most lavish praise could hardly have met the real deserts of his army.When the wars were done he saw little,save in his official capacity,of his old comrades-in-arms.And yet,from major-general to drummer-boy,he was the man whom they would all have elected to serve under,had the work to be done once more.As one of them said，“The sight of his long nose was worth ten thousand men on a field of battle.”They were themselves a leathery breed,and cared little for the gentler amenities so long as the French were well drubbed.

His mind,which was comprehensive and alert in warfare,was singularly limited in civil affairs.As a statesman he was so constant an example of devotion to duty,self-sacrifice,and high disinterested character,that the country was the better for his presence.But he fiercely opposed Catholic Emancipation,the Reform Bill,and everything upon which our modern life is founded.He could never be brought to see that a pyramid should stand on its base and not on its apex,and that the larger the pyramid,the broader should be the base.Even in military affairs he was averse from every change,and I know of no improvements which came from his initiative during all those years when his authority was supreme.The floggings which broke a man's spirit and self-respect,the leathern stock which hampered his movements,all the old traditional régime found a champion in him.On the other hand,he strongly opposed the introduction of the percussion cap as opposed to the flint and steel in the musket.Neither in war nor in politics did he rightly judge the future.

And yet in reading his letters and dispatches,one is surprised sometimes at the incisive thought and its vigorous expression.There is a passage in which he describes the way in which his soldiers would occasionally desert into some town which he was besieging.“They knew，”he writes，“that they must be taken,for when we lay our bloody hands upon a place we are sure to take it,sooner or later；but they liked being dry and under cover,and then that extraordinary caprice which always pervades the English character！Our deserters are very badly treated by the enemy；those who deserted in France were treated as the lowest of mortals,slaves and scavengers.Nothing but English caprice can account for it；just what makes our noblemen associate with stage-coach drivers,and become stagecoach drivers themselves.”After reading that passage,how often does the phrase“the extraordinary caprice which always pervades the English character”come back as one observes some fresh manifestation of it！

But let not my last note upon the great duke be a carping one.Rather let my final sentence be one which will remind you of his frugal and abstemious life,his carpetless floor and little camp bed,his precise courtesy which left no humblest letter unanswered,his courage which never flinched,his tenacity which never faltered,his sense of duty which made his life one long unselfish effort on behalf of what seemed to him to be the highest interest of the State.Go down and stand by the huge granite sarcophagus in the dim light of the crypt of St.Paul's,and in the hush of that austere spot,cast back your mind to the days when little England alone stood firm against the greatest soldier and the greatest army that the world has ever known.Then you feel what this dead man stood for,and you pray that we may still find such another amongst us when the clouds gather once again.

You see that the literature of Waterloo is well represented in my small military library.Of all books dealing with the personal view of the matter,I think that“Siborne's Letters，”which is a collection of the narratives of surviving officers made by Siborne in the year 1827，is the most interesting.Gronow's account is also very vivid and interesting.Of the strategical narratives,Houssaye's book is my favorite.Taken from the French point of view,it gets the actions of the allies in truer perspective than any English or German account can do；but there is a fascination about that great combat which makes every narrative that bears upon it of enthralling interest.

Wellington used to say that too much was made of it,and that one would imagine that the British Army had never fought a battle before.It was a characteristic speech,but it must be admitted that the British Army never had,as a matter of fact,for many centuries fought a battle which was finally decisive of a great European war.There lies the perennial interest of the incident,that it was the last act of that long-drawn drama,and that to the very fall of the curtain no man could tell how the play would end—“the nearest run thing that ever you saw”—that was the victor's description.It is a singular thing that during those twenty-five years of incessant fighting the material and methods of warfare made so little progress.So far as I know,there was no great change in either between 1789 and 1815.The breech-loader,heavy artillery,the ironclad,all great advances in the art of war,have been invented in time of peace.There are some improvements so obvious,and at the same time so valuable,that it is extraordinary that they were not adopted.Signaling,for example,whether by heliograph or by flag-waving,would have made an immense difference in the Napoleonic campaigns.The principle of the semaphore was well known,and Belgium,with its numerous windmills,would seem to be furnished with natural semaphores.Yet in the four days during which the campaign of Waterloo was fought,the whole scheme of military operations on both sides was again and again imperilled,and finally in the case of the French brought to utter ruin by lack of that intelligence which could so easily have been conveyed.June 18th was at intervals a sunshiny day—a four-inch glass mirror would have put Napoleon in communication with Gruchy,and the whole history of Europe might have been altered.Wellington himself suffered dreadfully from defective information which might have been easily supplied.The unexpected presence of the French army was first discovered at four in the morning of June 15.It was of enormous importance to get the news rapidly to Wellington at Brussels that he might instantly concentrate his scattered forces on the best line of resistance—yet,through the folly of sending only a single messenger,this vital information did not reach him until three in the afternoon,the distance being thirty miles.Again,when Blucher was defeated at Ligny on the 16th,it was of enormous importance that Wellington should know at once the line of his retreat so as to prevent the French from driving a wedge between them.The single Prussian officer who was despatched with this information was wounded,and never reached his destination,and it was only next day that Wellington learned the Prussian plans.On what tiny things does History depend！





IX


The contemplation of my fine little regiment of French military memoirs had brought me to the question of Napoleon himself,and you see that I have a very fair line dealing with him also.There is Scott's life,which is not entirely a success.His ink was too precious to be shed in such a venture.But here are the three volumes of the physician Bourrienne—that Bourrienne who knew him so well.Does anyone ever know a man so well as his doctor?They are quite excellent and admirably translated.Meneval also—the patient Meneval—who wrote for untold hours to dictation at ordinary talking speed,and yet was expected to be legible and to make no mistakes.At least his master could not fairly criticise his legibility,for is it not on record that when Napoleon's holograph account of an engagement was laid before the President of the Senate,the worthy man thought that it was a drawn plan of the battle?Meneval survived his master and has left an excellent and intimate account of him.There is Constant's account,also written from that point of view in which it is proverbial that no man is a hero.But of all the vivid terrible pictures of Napoleon the most haunting is by a man who never saw him and whose book was not directly dealing with him.I mean Taine's account of him,in the first volume of“Les Origines de la France Contemporaine.”You can never forget it when once you have read it.He produces his effect in a wonderful,and to me a novel,way.He does not,for example,say in mere crude words that Napoleon had a more than mediaeval Italian cunning.He presents a succession of documents—gives a series of contemporary instances to prove it.Then,having got that fixed in your head by blow after blow,he passes on to another phase of his character,his cold-hearted amorousness,his power of work,his spoiled child wilfulness,or some other quality,and piles up his illustrations of that.Instead,for example,of saying that the Emperor had a marvelous memory for detail,we have the account of the head of Artillery laying the list of all the guns in France before his master,who looked over it and remarked，“Yes,but you have omitted two in a fort near Dieppe.”So the man is gradually etched in with indelible ink.It is a wonderful figure of which you are conscious in the end,the figure of an archangel,but surely of an archangel of darkness.

We will,after Taine's method,take one fact and let it speak for itself.Napoleon left a legacy in a codicil to his will to a man who tried to assassinate Wellington.There is the mediaeval Italian again！He was no more a Corsican than the Englishman born in India is a Hindoo.Read the lives of the Borgias,the Sforzas,the Medicis,and of all the lustful,cruel,broad-minded,art-loving,talented despots of the little Italian States,including Genoa,from which the Buonapartes migrated.There at once you get the real descent of the man,with all the stigmata clear upon him—the outward calm,the inward passion,the layer of snow above the volcano,everything which characterized the old despots of his native land,the pupils of Machiavelli,but all raised to the dimensions of genius.You can whitewash him as you may,but you will never get a layer thick enough to cover the stain of that cold-blooded deliberate endorsement of his noble adversary's assassination.

Another book which gives an extraordinarily vivid picture of the man is this one—the Memoirs of Madame de Remusat.She was in daily contact with him at the Court,and she studied him with those quick critical eyes of a clever woman,the most unerring things in life when they are not blinded by love.If you have read those pages,you feel that you know him as if you had yourself seen and talked with him.His singular mixture of the small and the great,his huge sweep of imagination,his very limited knowledge,his intense egotism,his impatience of obstacles,his boorishness,his gross impertinence to women,his diabolical playing upon the weak side of every one with whom he came in contact—they make up among them one of the most striking of historical portraits.

Most of my books deal with the days of his greatness,but here,you see,is a three-volume account of those weary years at St.Helena.Who can help pitying the mewed eagle?And yet if you play the great game you must pay a stake.This was the same man who had a royal duke shot in a ditch because he was a danger to his throne.Was not he himself a danger to every throne in Europe?Why so harsh a retreat as St.Helena,you say?Remember that he had been put in a milder one before,that he had broken away from it,and that the lives of fifty thousand men had paid for the mistaken leniency.All this is forgotten now,and the pathetic picture of the modern Prometheus chained to his rock and devoured by the vultures of his own bitter thoughts,is the one impression which the world has retained.It is always so much easier to follow the emotions than the reason,especially where a cheap magnanimity and second-hand generosity are involved.But reason must still insist that Europe's treatment of Napoleon was not vindictive,and that Hudson Lowe was a man who tried to live up to the trust which had been committed to him by his country.

It was certainly not a post from which any one would hope for credit.If he were slack and easy-going all would be well.But there would be the chance of a second flight with its consequences.If he were strict and assiduous he would be assuredly represented as a petty tyrant.“I am glad when you are on outpost，”said Lowe's general in some campaign，“for then I am sure of a sound rest.”He was on outpost at St.Helena,and because he was true to his duties Europe（France included）had a sound rest.But he purchased it at the price of his own reputation.The greatest schemer in the world,having nothing else on which to vent his energies,turned them all to the task of vilifying his guardian.It was natural enough that he who had never known control should not brook it now.It is natural also that sentimentalists who have not thought of the details should take the Emperor's point of view.What is deplorable,however,is that our own people should be misled by one-sided accounts,and that they should throw to the wolves a man who was serving his country in a post of anxiety and danger,with such responsibility upon him as few could ever have endured.Let them remember Montholon's remark：“An angel from heaven would not have satisfied us.”Let them recall also that Lowe with ample material never once troubled to state his own case.“Je fais mon devoir et suis indifférent pour le reste，”said he,in his interview with the Emperor.They were no idle words.

Apart from this particular epoch,French literature,which is so rich in all its branches,is richest of all in its memoirs.Whenever there was anything of interest going forward there was always some kindly gossip who knew all about it,and was ready to set it down for the benefit of posterity.Our own history has not nearly enough of these charming sidelights.Look at our sailors in the Napoleonic wars,for example.They played an epoch-making part.For nearly twenty years Freedom was a Refugee upon the seas.Had our navy been swept away,then all Europe would have been one organized despotism.At times everybody was against us,fighting against their own direct interests under the pressure of that terrible hand.We fought on the waters with the French,with the Spaniards,with the Danes,with the Russians,with the Turks,even with our American kinsmen.Middies grew into post-captains,and admirals into dotards during that prolonged struggle.And what have we in literature to show for it all?Marryat's novels,many of which are founded upon personal experience,Nelson's and Collingwood's letters,Lord Cochrane's biography—that is about all.I wish we had more of Collingwood,for he wielded a fine pen.Do you remember the sonorous opening of his Trafalgar message to his captains?—

The ever to be lamented death of Lord Viscount Nelson,Duke of Bronte,the Commander-in-Chief,who fell in the action of the 21st,in the arms of Victory,covered with glory,whose memory will be ever dear to the British Navy and the British Nation；whose zeal for the honor of his king and for the interests of his country will be ever held up as a shining example for a British

seaman—leaves to me a duty to return thanks,etc.，etc.

It was a worthy sentence to carry such a message,written too in a raging tempest,with sinking vessels all around him.But in the main it is a poor crop from such a soil.No doubt our sailors were too busy to do much writing,but none the less one wonders that among so many thousands there were not some to understand what a treasure their experiences would be to their descendants.I can call to mind the old three-deckers which used to rot in Portsmouth Harbor,and I have often thought,could they tell their tales,what a missing chapter in our literature they could supply.

It is not only in Napoleonic memoirs that the French are so fortunate.The almost equally interesting age of Louis XIV produced an even more wonderful series.If you go deeply into the subject you are amazed by their number,and you feel as if everyone at the Court of the Roi Soleil had done what he（or she）could to give away their neighbors.Just to take the more obvious,there are St.Simon's Memoirs—those in themselves give us a more comprehensive and intimate view of the age than anything I know of which treats of the times of Queen Victoria.Then there is St.Evremond,who is nearly as complete.Do you want the view of a woman of quality?There are the letters of Madame de Sévigné（eight volumes of them），perhaps the most wonderful series of letters that any woman has ever penned.Do you want the confessions of a rake of the period?Here are the too salacious memoirs of the mischievous Due de Roquelaure,not reading for the nursery certainly,not even for the boudoir,but a strange and very intimate picture of the times.All these books fit into each other,for the characters of the one reappear in the others.You come to know them quite familiarly before you have finished,their loves and their hates,their duels,their intrigues,and their ultimate fortunes.If you do not care to go so deeply into it you have only to put Julia Pardoe’s four-volumed“Court of Louis XIV”upon your shelf,and you will find a very admirable condensation—or a distillation rather,for most of the salt is left behind.There is another book too—that big one on the bottom shelf—which holds it all between its brown and gold covers.An extravagance that—for it cost me some sovereigns—but it is something to have the portraits of all that wonderful galaxy,of Louis,of the devout Maintenon,of the frail Montespan,of Bossuet,Fénelon,Molière,Racine,Pascal,Condé，Turenne,and all the saints and sinners of the age.If you want to make yourself a present,and chance upon a copy of“The Court and Times of Louis XIV，”you will never think that your money has been wasted.

Well,I have bored you unduly,my patient friend,with my love of memoirs,Napoleonic and otherwise,which give a touch of human interest to the arid records of history.Not that history should be arid.It ought to be the most interesting subject upon earth,the story of ourselves,of our forefathers,of the human race,the events which made us what we are,and wherein,if Weismann's views hold the field,some microscopic fraction of this very body which for the instant we chance to inhabit may have borne a part.But unfortunately the power of accumulating knowledge and that of imparting it are two very different things,and the uninspired historian becomes merely the dignified compiler of an enlarged almanac.Worst of all,when a man does come along with fancy and imagination,who can breathe the breath of life into the dry bones,it is the fashion for the dryasdusts to belabor him,as one who has wandered away from the orthodox path and must necessarily be inaccurate.So Froude was attacked.So also Macaulay in his day.But both will be read when the pedants are forgotten.If I were asked my very ideal of how history should be written,I think I should point to those two rows on yonder shelf,the one McCarthy's“History of Our Own Times，”the other Lecky's“History of England in the Eighteenth Century.”Curious that each should have been written by an Irishman,and that though of opposite politics and living in an age when Irish affairs have caused such bitterness,both should be conspicuous not merely for all literary graces,but for that broad toleration which sees every side of a question,and handles every problem from the point of view of the philosophic observer and never of the sectarian partisan.

By the way,talking of history,have you read Parkman's works?He was,I think,among the very greatest of the historians,and yet one seldom hears his name.A New England man by birth,and writing principally of the early history of the American Settlements and of French Canada,it is perhaps excusable that he should have no great vogue in England,but even among Americans I have found many who have not read him.There are four of his volumes in green and gold down yonder.“The Jesuits in Canada，”and“Frontenac，”but there are others,all of them well worth reading，“Pioneers of France，”“Montcalm and Wolfe，”“Discovery of the Great West，”etc.Some day I hope to have a complete set.

Taking only that one book，“The Jesuits in Canada，”it is worth a reputation in itself.And how noble a tribute is this which a man of Puritan blood pays to that wonderful Order！He shows how in the heyday of their enthusiasm these brave soldiers of the Cross invaded Canada as they did China and every other place where danger was to be faced,and a horrible death to be found.I don't care what faith a man may profess,or whether he be a Christian at all,but he cannot read these true records without feeling that the very highest that man has ever evolved in sanctity and devotion was to be found among these marvelous men.They were indeed the pioneers of civilization,for apart from doctrines they brought among the savages the highest European culture,and in their own deportment an object-lesson of how chastely,austerely,and nobly men could live.France has sent myriads of brave men on to her battlefields,but in all her long record of glory I do not think that she can point to any courage so steadfast and so absolutely heroic as that of the men of the Iroquois Mission.

How nobly they lived makes the body of the book,how serenely they died forms the end to it.It is a tale which cannot even now be read without a shudder—a nightmare of horrors.Fanaticism may brace a man to hurl himself into oblivion,as the Mahdi's hordes did before Khartoum,but one feels that it is at least a higher development of such emotion,where men slowly and in cold blood endure so thankless a life,and welcome so dreadful an end.Every faith can equally boast its martyrs—a painful thought,since it shows how many thousands must have given their blood for error—but in testifying to their faith these brave men have testified to something more important still,to the subjugation of the body and to the absolute supremacy of the dominating spirit.

The story of Father Jogue is but one of many,and yet it is worth recounting,as showing the spirit of the men.He also was on the Iroquois Mission,and was so tortured and mutilated by his sweet parishioners that the very dogs used to howl at his distorted figure.He made his way back to France,not for any reason of personal rest or recuperation,but because he needed a special dispensation to say Mass.The Catholic Church has a regulation that a priest shall not be deformed,so that the savages with their knives had wrought better than they knew.He received his dispensation and was sent for by Louis XIV,who asked him what he could do for him.No doubt the assembled courtiers expected to hear him ask for the next vacant Bishopric.What he did actually ask for,as the highest favor,was to be sent back to the Iroquois Mission,where the savages signalized his arrival by burning him alive.

Parkman is worth reading,if it were only for his account of the Indians.Perhaps the very strangest thing about them,and the most unaccountable,is their small numbers.The Iroquois were one of the most formidable of tribes.They were of the Five Nations,whose scalping-parties wandered over an expanse of thousands of square miles.Yet there is good reason to doubt whether the whole five nations could have put as many thousand warriors in the field.It was the same with all the other tribes of North Americans,both in the east,the north,and the west.Their numbers were always insignificant.And yet they had that huge country to themselves,the best of climates,and plenty of food.Why was it that they did not people it thickly?It may be taken as a striking example of the purpose and design which run through the affairs of men,that at the very moment when the old world was ready to overflow the new world was empty to receive it.Had North America been peopled as China is peopled,the Europeans might have founded some settlements,but could never have taken possession of the Continent.Buffon has made the striking remark that the creative power appeared to have never had great vigor in America.He alluded to the abundance of the flora and fauna as compared with that of other great divisions of the earth's surface.Whether the numbers of the Indians are an illustration of the same fact,or whether there is some special cause,is beyond my very modest scientific attainments.When one reflects upon the countless herds of bison which used to cover the Western plains,or marks in the present day the race statistics of the French Canadians at one end of the Continent,and of the Southern negro at the other,it seems absurd to suppose that there is any geographical reason against Nature being as prolific here as elsewhere.However,these be deeper waters,and with your leave we will get back into my usual six-inch wading-depth once more.

I don't know how those two little books got in there.They are Henley's“Song of the Sword”and“Book of Verses.”They ought to be over yonder in the rather limited Poetry Section.Perhaps it is that I like his work so,whether it be prose or verse,and so have put them ready to my hand.He was a remarkable man,a man who was very much greater than his work,great as some of his work was.I have seldom known a personality more magnetic and stimulating.You left his presence,as a battery leaves a generating station,charged up and full.He made you feel what a lot of work there was to be done,and how glorious it was to be able to do it,and how needful to get started upon it that very hour.With the frame and the vitality of a giant he was cruelly bereft of all outlet for his strength,and so distilled it off in hot words,in warm sympathy,in strong prejudices,in all manner of human and stimulating emotions.Much of the time and energy which might have built an imperishable name for himself was spent in encouraging others；but it was not waste,for he left his broad thumb-mark upon all that passed beneath it.A dozen second-hand Henleys are fortifying our literature to-day.

Alas that we have so little of his very best！for that very best was the finest of our time.Few poets ever wrote sixteen consecutive lines more noble and more strong than those which begin with the well-known quatrain—

Out of the night that covers me，

Black as the pit from Pole to Pole，

I thank whatever Gods there be，

For my unconquerable soul.

It is grand literature,and it is grand pluck too；for it came from a man who,through no fault of his own,had been pruned,and pruned again,like an ill-grown shrub,by the surgeon's knife.When he said—

In the fell clutch of Circumstance，

I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Beneath the bludgeonings of Chance，

My head is bloody but unbowed.

It was not what Lady Byron called“The mimic woe”of the poet,but it was rather the grand defiance of the Indian warrior at the stake,whose proud soul can hold in hand his quivering body.

There were two quite distinct veins of poetry in Henley,each the very extreme from the other.The one was heroic,gigantic,running to large sweeping images and thundering words.Such are the“Song of the Sword”and much more that he has written,like the wild singing of some Northern scald.The other,and to my mind both the more characteristic and the finer side of his work,is delicate,precise,finely etched,with extraordinarily vivid little pictures drawn in carefully phrased and balanced English.Such are the“Hospital Verses，”while the“London Voluntaries”stand midway between the two styles.What！You have not read the“Hospital Verses！”Then get the“Book of Verses”and read them without delay.You will surely find something there which,for good or ill,is unique.You can name—or at least I can name—nothing to compare it with.Goldsmith and Crabbe have written of indoor themes；but their monotonous,if majestic meter,wearies the modern reader.But this is so varied,so flexible,so dramatic.It stands by itself.Confound the weekly journals and all the other lightning conductors which caused such a man to pass away,and to leave a total output of about five booklets behind him！

However,all this is an absolute digression,for the books had no business in this shelf at all.This corner is meant for chronicles of various sorts.Here are three in a line,which carry you over a splendid stretch of French（which usually means European）history,each,as luck would have it,beginning just about the time when the other leaves off.The first is Froissart,the second de Monstrelet,and the third de Comines.When you have read the three you have the best contemporary account first hand of considerably more than a century—a fair slice out of the total written record of the human race.

Froissart is always splendid.If you desire to avoid the mediaeval French,which only a specialist can read with pleasure,you can get Lord Berners'almost equally mediaeval,but very charming English,or you can turn to a modern translation,such as this one of Johnes.A single page of Lord Berners is delightful；but it is a strain,I think,to read bulky volumes in an archaic style.Personally,I prefer the modern,and even with that you have shown some patience before you have reached the end of that big second tome.

I wonder whether,at the time,the old Hainault Canon had any idea of what he was doing—whether it ever flashed across his mind that the day might come when his book would be the one great authority,not only about the times in which he lived,but about the whole institution of chivalry?I fear that it is far more likely that his whole object was to gain some mundane advantage from the various barons and knights whose names and deeds he recounts.He has left it on record,for example,that when he visited the Court of England he took with him a handsomely-bound copy of his work；and,doubtless,if one could follow the good Canon one would find his journeys littered with similar copies which were probably expensive gifts to the recipient,for what return would a knightly soul make for a book which enshrined his own valor?

But without looking too curiously into his motives,it must be admitted that the work could not have been done more thoroughly.There is something of Herodotus in the Canon's cheery,chatty,garrulous,take-it-or-leave-it manner.But he has the advantage of the old Greek in accuracy.Considering that he belonged to the same age which gravely accepted the travelers'tales of Sir John Maundeville,it is,I think,remarkable how careful and accurate the chronicler is.Take,for example,his description of Scotland and the Scotch.Some would give the credit to Jean-le-Bel,but that is another matter.Scotch descriptions are a subject over which a fourteenth-century Hainaulter might fairly be allowed a little scope for his imagination.Yet we can see that the account must on the whole have been very correct.The Galloway nags,the girdle-cakes,the bagpipes—every little detail rings true.Jean-le-Bel was actually present in a Border campaign,and from him Froissart got his material；but he has never attempted to embroider it,and its accuracy,where we can to some extent test it,must predispose us to accept his accounts where they are beyond our confirmation.

But the most interesting portion of old Froissart's work is that which deals with the knights and the knight-errants of his time,their deeds,their habits,their methods of talking.It is true that he lived himself just a little after the true heyday of chivalry；but he was quite early enough to have met many of the men who had been looked upon as the flower of knighthood of the time.His book was read too,and commented on by these very men（as many of them as could read），and so we may take it that it was no fancy portrait,but a correct picture of these soldiers which is to be found in it.The accounts are always consistent.If you collate the remarks and speeches of the knights（as I have had occasion to do）you will find a remarkable uniformity running through them.We may believe then that this really does represent the kind of men who fought at Crecy and at Poictiers,in the age when both the French and the Scottish kings were prisoners in London,and England reached a pitch of military glory which has perhaps never been equaled in her history.

In one respect these knights differ from anything which we have had presented to us in our historical romances.To turn to the supreme romancer,you will find that Scott's mediaeval knights were usually muscular athletes in the prime of life：Bois-Guilbert,Front-de-Boeuf,Richard,Ivanhoe,Count Robert—they all were such.But occasionally the most famous of Froissart's knights were old,crippled and blinded.Chandos,the best lance of his day,must have been over seventy when he lost his life through being charged upon the side on which he had already lost an eye.He was well on to that age when he rode out from the English army and slew the Spanish champion,big Marten Ferrara,upon the morning of Navaretta.Youth and strength were very useful,no doubt,especially where heavy armor had to be carried,but once on the horse's back the gallant steed supplied the muscles.In an English hunting-field many a doddering old man,when he is once firmly seated in his familiar saddle,can give points to the youngsters at the game.So it was among the knights,and those who had outlived all else could still carry to the wars their wiliness,their experience with arms,and,above all,their cool and undaunted courage.

Beneath his varnish of chivalry,it cannot be gainsaid that the knight was often a bloody-minded and ferocious barbarian.There was little quarter in his wars,save when a ransom might be claimed.But with all his savagery,he was a light-hearted creature,like a formidable boy playing a dreadful game.He was true also to his own curious code,and,so far as his own class went,his feelings were genial and sympathetic,even in warfare.There was no personal feeling or bitterness as there might be now in a war between Frenchmen and Germans.On the contrary,the opponents were very soft-spoken and polite to each other.“Is there any small vow of which I may relieve you?”“Would you desire to attempt some small deed of arms upon me?”And in the midst of a fight they would stop for a breather,and converse amicably the while,with many compliments upon each other's prowess.When Seaton the Scotsman had exchanged as many blows as he wished with a company of French knights,he said.“Thank you,gentlemen,thank you！”and galloped away.An English knight made a vow，“for his own advancement and the exaltation of his lady，”that he would ride into the hostile city of Paris,and touch with his lance the inner barrier.The whole story is most characteristic of the times.As he galloped up,the French knights around the barrier,seeing that he was under vow,made no attack upon him,and called out to him that he had carried himself well.As he returned,however,there stood an unmannerly butcher with a pole-axe upon the sidewalk,who struck him as he passed,and killed him.Here ends the chronicler；but I have not the least doubt that the butcher had a very evil time at the hands of the French knights,who would not stand by and see one of their own order,even if he were an enemy,meet so plebeian an end.

De Comines,as a chronicler,is less quaint and more conventional than Froissart,but the writer of romance can dig plenty of stones out of that quarry for the use of his own little building.Of course Quentin Durward has come bodily out of the pages of De Comines.The whole history of Louis XI and his relations with Charles the Bold,the strange life at Plessis-le-Tours,the plebeian courtiers,the barber and the hangman,the astrologers,the alternations of savage cruelty and of slavish superstition—it is all set forth here.One would imagine that such a monarch was unique,that such a mixture of strange qualities and monstrous crimes could never be matched,and yet like causes will always produce like results.Read Walewski's“Life of Ivan the Terrible，”and you will find that more than a century later Russia produced a monarch even more diabolical,but working exactly on the same lines as Louis,even down to small details.The same cruelty,the same superstition,the same astrologers,the same low-born associates,the same residence outside the influence of the great cities—a parallel could hardly be more complete.If you have not supped too full of horrors when you have finished Ivan,then pass on to the same author's account of Peter the Great.What a land！What a succession of monarchs！Blood and snow and iron！Both Ivan and Peter killed their own sons.And there is a hideous mockery of religion running through it all which gives it a grotesque horror of its own.We have had our Henry the Eighth,but our very worst would have been a wise and benevolent rule in Russia.

Talking of romance and of chivalry,that tattered book down yonder has as much between its disreputable covers as most that I know.It is Washington Irving's“Conquest of Grenada.”I do not know where he got his material for this book—from Spanish chronicles,I presume—but the wars between the Moors and the Christian knights must have been among the most chivalrous of exploits.I could not name a book which gets the beauty and the glamour of it better than this one,the lance-heads gleaming in the dark defiles,the red bale fires glowing on the crags,the stern devotion of the mail-clad Christians,the déhonnaire and courtly courage of the dashing Moslem.Had Washington Irving written nothing else,that book alone should have forced the door of every library.I love all his books,for no man wrote fresher English with a purer style；but of them all it is still“The Conquest of Grenada”to which I turn most often.

To hark back for a moment to history as seen in romances,here are two exotics side by side,which have a flavor that is new.They are a brace of foreign novelists,each of whom,so far as I know,has only two books.This green-and-gold volume contains both the works of the Pomeranian Meinhold in an excellent translation by Lady Wilde.The first is“Sidonia the Sorceress，”the second“The Amber Witch.”I don't know where one may turn for a stranger view of the Middle Ages,the quaint details of simple life,with sudden intervals of grotesque savagery.The most weird and barbarous things are made human and comprehensible.There is one incident which haunts one after one has read it,where the executioner chaffers with the villagers as to what price they will give him for putting some young witch to the torture,running them up from a barrel of apples to a barrel and a half,on the grounds that he is now old and rheumatic,and that the stooping and straining is bad for his back.It should be done on a sloping hill,he explains,so that the“dear little children”may see it easily.Both“Sidonia”and“The Amber Witch”give such a picture of old Germany as I have never seen elsewhere.

But Meinhold belongs to a bygone generation.This other author in whom I find a new note,and one of great power,is Merejkowski,who is,if I mistake not,young and with his career still before him.“The Forerunner”and“The Death of the Gods”are the only two books of his which I have been able to obtain,but the pictures of Renaissance Italy in the one,and of declining Rome in the other,are in my opinion among the masterpieces of fiction.I confess that as I read them I was pleased to find how open my mind was to new impressions,for one of the greatest mental dangers which comes upon a man as he grows older is that he should become so attached to old favorites that he has no room for the new-comer,and persuades himself that the days of great things are at an end because his own poor brain is getting ossified.You have but to open any critical paper to see how common is the disease,but a knowledge of literary history assures us that it has always been the same,and that if the young writer is discouraged by adverse comparisons it has been the common lot from the beginning.He has but one resource,which is to pay no heed to criticism,but to try to satisfy his own highest standard and leave the rest to time and the public.Here is a little bit of doggerel,pinned,as you see,beside my bookcase,which may in a ruffled hour bring peace and guidance to some younger brother—

Critics kind—never mind！

Critics flatter—no matter！

Critics blame—all the same！

Critics curse—none the worse！

Do your best—the rest！





XI


I have been talking in the past tense of heroes and of knight-errants,but surely their day is not yet passed.When the earth has all been explored,when the last savage has been tamed,when the final cannon has been scrapped,and the world has settled down into unbroken virtue and unutterable dullness,men will cast their thoughts back to our age,and will idealize our romance and our courage,even as we do that of our distant forbears.“It is wonderful what these people did with their rude implements and their limited appliances！”That is what they will say when they read of our explorations,our voyages,and our wars.

Now,take that first book on my travel shelf.It is Knight's“The cruise of the Falcon.''Nature was guilty of the pun which put this soul into a body so named.Read this simple record and tell me if there is anything in Hakluyt more wonderful.Two landsmen—solicitors,if I remember right—go down to Southampton Quay.They pick up a long-shore youth,and they embark in a tiny boat in which they put to sea.Where do they turn up?At Buenos Ayres.Thence they penetrate to Paraguay,return to the West Indies,sell their little boat there,and go home.What could the Elizabethan mariners have done more?There are no Spanish galleons now to vary the monotony of such a voyage,but had there been I am very certain our adventurers would have had their share of the doubloons.But surely it was the nobler when done out of the pure lust of adventure and in answer to the call of the sea,with no golden bait to draw them on.The old spirit still lives,disguise it as you will with top hats,frock coats,and all prosaic settings.Perhaps even they also will seem romantic when centuries have blurred them.

Another book which shows the romance and the heroism which still linger upon earth is that large copy of the“Voyage of the Discovery in the Antarctic”by Captain Scott.Written in plain sailor fashion with no attempt at overstatement or color,it none the less（or perhaps all the more）leaves a deep impression upon the mind.As one reads it,and reflects on what one reads,one seems to get a clear view of just those qualities which make the best kind of Briton.Every nation produces brave men.Every nation has men of energy.But there is a certain type which mixes its bravery and its energy with a gentle modesty and a boyish good-humor,and it is just this type which is the highest.Here the whole expedition seem to have been imbued with the spirit of their commander.No flinching,no grumbling,every discomfort taken as a jest,no thought of self,each working only for the success of the enterprise.When you have read of such privations so endured and so chronicled,it makes one ashamed to show emotion over the small annoyances of daily life.Read of Scott's blinded,scurvy-struck party staggering on to their goal,and then complain,if you can,of the heat of a northern sun,or the dust of a country road.

That is one of the weaknesses of modern life.We complain too much.We are not ashamed of complaining.Time was when it was otherwise—when it was thought effeminate to complain.The Gentleman should always be the Stoic,with his soul too great to be affected by the small troubles of life.“You look cold,sir，”said an English sympathizer to a French emigré.The fallen noble drew himself up in his threadbare coat.“Sir，”said he，“a gentleman is never cold.”One’s consideration for others as well as one’s own self-respect should check the grumble.This self-suppression,and also the concealment of pain are two of the old noblesse oblige characteristics which are now little more than a tradition.Public opinion should be firmer on the matter.The man who must hop because his shin is hacked,or wring his hand because his knuckles are bruised should be made to feel that he is an object not of pity,but of contempt.

The tradition of Arctic exploration is a noble one among Americans as well as ourselves.The next book is a case in point.It is Greely's“Arctic Service，”and it is a worthy shelf-companion to Scott's“Account of the Voyage of the Discovery.''There are incidents in this book which one can never forget.The episode of those twenty-odd men lying upon that horrible bluff,and dying one a day from cold and hunger and scurvy,is one which dwarfs all our puny tragedies of romance.And the gallant starving leader giving lectures on abstract science in an attempt to take the thoughts of the dying men away from their sufferings—what a picture！It is bad to suffer from cold and bad to suffer from hunger,and bad to live in the dark；but that men could do all these things for six months on end,and that some should live to tell the tale,is,indeed,a marvel.What a world of feeling lies in the exclamation of the poor dying lieutenant：“Well,this is wretched，”he groaned,as he turned his face to the wall.

The Anglo-Celtic race has always run to individualism,and yet there is none which is capable of conceiving and carrying out a finer ideal of discipline.There is nothing in Roman or Grecian annals,not even the lava-baked sentry at Pompeii,which gives a more sternly fine object-lesson in duty than the young recruits of the British army who went down in their ranks on the Birkenhead.And this expedition of Greely's gave rise to another example which seems to me hardly less remarkable.You may remember,if you have read the book,that even when there were only about eight unfortunates still left,hardly able to move for weakness and hunger,the seven took the odd man out upon the ice,and shot him dead for breach of discipline.The whole grim proceeding was carried out with as much method and signing of papers,as if they were all within sight of the Capitol at Washington.His offense had consisted,so far as I can remember,of stealing and eating the thong which bound two portions of the sledge together,something about as appetizing as a bootlace.It is only fair to the commander to say,however,that it was one of a series of petty thefts,and that the thong of a sledge might mean life or death to the whole party.

Personally I must confess that anything bearing upon the Arctic Seas is always of the deepest interest to me.He who has once been within the borders of that mysterious region,which can be both the most lovely and the most repellent upon earth,must always retain something of its glamour.Standing on the confines of known geography I have shot the southward flying ducks,and have taken from their gizzards pebbles which they have swallowed in some land whose shores no human foot has trod.The memory of that inexpressible air,of the great ice-girt lakes of deep blue water,of the cloudless sky shading away into a light green and then into a cold yellow at the horizon,of the noisy companionable birds,of the huge,greasy-backed water animals,of the slug-like seals,startlingly black against the dazzling whiteness of the ice—all of it will come back to a man in his dreams,and will seem little more than some fantastic dream itself,so removed is it from the main stream of his life.And then to play a fish a hundred tons in weight,and worth two thousand pounds—but what in the world has all this to do with my bookcase?

Yet it has its place in my main line of thought,for it leads me straight to the very next upon the shelf,Bullen's“Cruise of the Cachelot”a book which is full of the glamour and the mystery of the sea,marred only by the brutality of those who go down to it in ships.This is the sperm-whale fishing,an open-sea affair,and very different from that Greenland ice groping in which I served a seven-months'apprenticeship.Both,I fear,are things of the past—certainly the northern fishing is so,for why should men risk their lives to get oil when one has but to sink a pipe in the ground.It is the more fortunate then that it should have been handled by one of the most virile writers who has described a sailor's life.Bullen's English at its best rises to a great height.If I wished to show how high I would take that next book down，“Sea Idylls.”

How is this,for example,if you have an ear for the music of prose?It is a simple paragraph out of the magnificent description of a long calm in the tropics.

A change,unusual as unwholesome,came over the bright blue of the sea.No longer did it reflect,as in a limpid mirror the splendor of the sun,the sweet silvery glow of the moon,or the coruscating clusters of countless stars.Like the ashen-gray hue that bedims the

countenance of the dying,a filmy greasy skin appeared to overspread the recent loveliness of the ocean surface.The sea was sick,stagnant,and foul,from its turbid waters arose a miasmatic vapor like a breath of decay,which clung clammily to the palate and dulled all the senses.Drawn by some strange force,from the unfathomable depths below,eerie shapes sought the surface,blinking glassily at the unfamiliar glare they had exchanged for their native gloom—uncouth creatures bedight with tasselled fringes like weed-growths waving around them,fathom-long,medusae with colored spots like eyes clustering all over their transparent substance,wriggling worm-like forms of such elusive matter that the smallest exposure to the sun melted them,and they were not.Lower down,vast pale shadows creep sluggishly along,happily undistinguishable as yet,but adding a half-familiar flavor to the strange,faint smell that hung about us.

Take the whole of that essay which describes a calm in the Tropics,or take the other one：“Sunrise as seen from the Crow's-nest，”and you must admit that there have been few finer pieces of descriptive English in our time.If I had to choose a sea library of only a dozen volumes I should certainly given Bullen two places.The others?Well,it is so much a matter of individual taste.“Tom Cringle's Log”should have one for certain.I hope boys respond now as they once did to the sharks and the pirates,the planters,and all the rollicking high spirits of that splendid book.Then there is Dana's“Two Years before the Mast.”I should find room also for Stevenson's“Wrecker”and“Ebb Tide.”Clark Russell deserves a whole shelf for himself,but anyhow you could not miss out“The Wreck of the Grosvenor.”Marryat,of course,must be represented,and I should pick“Midshipman Easy”and“Peter Simple”as his samples.Then throw in one of Melville's Otaheite books—now far too completely forgotten—”Typee”or“Omoo，”and as a quite modern flavor Kipling’s“Captains Courageous”and Jack London’s“Sea Wolf，”with Conrad’s“Nigger of the Narcissus.”Then you will have enough to turn your study into a cabin and bring the wash and surge to your ears,if written words can do it.Oh,how one longs for it sometimes when life grows too artificial,and the old Viking blood begins to stir！Surely it must linger in all of us,for no man who dwells in an island but had an ancestor in longship or in coracle.Still more must the salt drop tingle in the blood of an American when you reflect that in all that broad continent there is not one whose forefather did not cross 3，000 miles of ocean.And yet there are in the Central States millions and millions of their descendants who have never seen the sea.

I have said that“Omoo”and“Typee，”the books in which the sailor Melville describes his life among the Otaheitans,have sunk too rapidly into obscurity.What a charming and interesting task there is for some critic of catholic tastes and sympathetic judgment to undertake rescue work among the lost books which would repay salvage！A small volume setting forth their names and their claims to attention would be interesting in itself,and more interesting in the material to which it would serve as an introduction.I am sure there are many good books,possibly there are some great ones,which have been swept away for a time in the rush.What chance,for example,has any book by an unknown author which is published at a moment of great national excitement,when some public crisis arrests the popular mind?Hundreds have been still-born in this fashion,and are there none which should have lived among them?Now,there is a book,a modern one,and written by a youth under thirty.It is Snaith's“Broke of Covenden，”and it scarce attained a second edition.I do not say that it is a Classic—I should not like to be positive that it is not—but I am perfectly sure that the man who wrote it has the possibility of a Classic within him.Here is another novel，“Eight Days”by Forrest.You can't buy it.You are lucky even if you can find it in a library.Yet nothing ever written will bring the Indian Mutiny home to you as this book will do.Here's another which I will warrant you never heard of.It is Powell's“Animal Episodes.”No,it is not a collection of dog-and-cat anecdotes,but it is a series of very singularly told stories which deal with the animal side of the human,and which you will feel have an entirely new flavor if you have a discriminating palate.The book came out ten years ago,and is utterly unknown.If I can point to three in one small shelf,how many lost lights must be flitting in the outer darkness！

Let me hark back for a moment to the subject with which I began,the romance of travel and the frequent heroism of modern life.I have two books of Scientific Exploration here which exhibit both these qualities as strongly as any I know.I could not choose two better books to put into a young man's hands if you wished to train him first in a gentle and noble firmness of mind,and secondly in a great love for and interest in all that pertains to Nature.The one is Darwin's“Journal of the Voyage of the Beagle.''Any discerning eye must have detected long before the“Origin of Species”appeared,simply on the strength of this book of travel,that a brain of the first order,united with many rare qualities of character,had arisen.Never was there a more comprehensive mind.Nothing was too small and nothing too great for its alert observation.One page is occupied in the analysis of some peculiarity in the web of a minute spider,while the next deals with the evidence for the subsidence of a continent,and the extinction of a myriad animals.And his sweep of knowledge was so great,botany,geology,zoology,each lending its corroborative aid to the other.How a youth of Darwin's age—he was only twenty-three when in the year 1831 he started round the world on the surveying ship Beagle—could have acquired such a mass of information fills one with the same wonder,and is perhaps of the same nature,as the boy musician who exhibits by instinct the touch of the master.Another quality which one would be less disposed to look for in the savant is a fine contempt for danger,which is veiled in such modesty that one reads between the lines in order to detect it.When he was in the Argentine,the country outside the Settlements was covered with roving bands of horse Indians,who gave no quarter to any whites.Yet Darwin rode the four hundred miles between Bahia and Buenos Ayres,when even the hardy Gauchos refused to accompany him.Personal danger and a hideous death were small things to him compared to a new beetle or an undescribed fly.

The second book to which I alluded is Wallace's“Malay Archipelago.”There is a strange similarity in the minds of the two men,the same courage,both moral and physical,the same gentle persistence,the same catholic knowledge and wide sweep of mind,the same passion for the observation of Nature.Wallace by a flash of intuition understood and described in a letter to Darwin the cause of the Origin of Species at the very time when the latter was publishing a book founded upon twenty years'labor to prove the same thesis.What must have been his feelings when he read that letter！And yet he had nothing to fear,for his book found no more enthusiastic admirer than the man who had in a sense anticipated it.Here also one sees that Science has its heroes no less than Religion.One of Wallace's missions in Papua was to examine the nature and species of the Birds-of-Paradise；but in the course of the years of his wanderings through those islands he made a complete investigation of the whole fauna.A foot-note somewhere explains that the Papuans who lived in the Bird-of-Paradise country were confirmed cannibals.Fancy living for years with or near such neighbors！Let a young fellow read these two books,and he cannot fail to have both his mind and his spirit strengthened by the reading.

Here we are at the final séance.For the last time,my patient comrade,I ask you to make yourself comfortable upon the old green settee,to look up at the oaken shelves,and to bear with me as best you may while I preach about their contents.The last time！And yet,as I look along the lines of the volumes,I have not mentioned one out of ten of those to which I owe a debt of gratitude,nor one in a hundred of the thoughts which course through my brain as I look at them.As well perhaps,for the man who has said all that he has to say has invariably said too much.

Let me be didactic for a moment！I assume this solemn—oh,call it not pedantic！—attitude because my eye catches the small but select corner which constitues my library of Science.I wanted to say that if I were advising a young man who was beginning life,I should counsel him to devote one evening a week to scientific reading.Had he the perseverance to adhere to his resolution,and if he began it at twenty,he would certainly find himself with an unusually well-furnished mind at thirty,which would stand him in right good stead in whatever line of life he might walk.When I advise him to read science,I do not mean that he should choke himself with the dust of the pedants,and lose himself in the subdivisions of the Lepidoptera,or the classifications of the dicotyledonous plants.These dreary details are the prickly bushes in that enchanted garden,and you are foolish indeed if you begin your walks by butting your head into one.Keep very clear of them until you have explored the open beds and wandered down every easy path.For this reason avoid the text-books,which repel,and cultivate that popular science which attracts.You cannot hope to be a specialist upon all these varied subjects.Better far to have a broad idea of general results,and to understand their relations to each other.A very little reading will give a man such a knowledge of geology,for example,as will make every quarry and railway cutting an object of interest.A very little zoology will enable you to satisfy your curiosity as to what is the proper name and style of this buff-ermine moth which at the present instant is buzzing round the lamp.A very little botany will enable you to recognize every flower you are likely to meet in your walks abroad,and to give you a tiny thrill of interest when you chance upon one which is beyond your ken.A very little archaeology will tell you all about yonder British tumulus,or help you to fill in the outline of the broken Roman camp upon the downs.A very little astronomy will cause you to look more intently at the heavens,to pick out your brothers the planets,who move in your own circles,from the stranger stars,and to appreciate the order,beauty,and majesty of that material universe which is most surely the outward sign of the spiritual force behind it.How a man of science can be a materialist is as amazing to me as how a sectarian can limit the possibilities of the Creator.Show me a picture without an artist,show me a bust without a sculptor,show me music without a musician,and then you may begin to talk to me of a universe without a Universe-maker,call Him by what name you will.

Here is Flammarion's“L'Atmosphère”—a very gorgeous though weather-stained copy in faded scarlet and gold.The book has a small history,and I value it.A young Frenchman,dying of fever on the west coast of Africa,gave it to me as a professional fee.The sight of it takes me back to a little ship’s bunk,and a sallow face with large,sad eyes looking out at me.Poor boy,I fear that he never saw his beloved Marseilles again！

Talking of popular science,I know no better books for exciting a man's first interest,and giving a broad general view of the subject,than these of Samuel Laing.Who would have imagined that the wise savant and gentle dreamer of these volumes was also the energetic secretary of a railway company?Many men of the highest scientific eminence have begun in prosaic lines of life.Herbert Spencer was a railway engineer.Wallace was a land surveyor.But that a man with so pronounced a scientific brain as Laing should continue all his life to devote his time to dull routine work,remaining in harness until extreme old age,with his soul still open to every fresh idea,and his brain acquiring new concretions of knowledge,is indeed a remarkable fact.Read those books,and you will be a fuller man.

It is an excellent device to talk about what you have recently read.Rather hard upon your audience,you may say；but without wishing to be personal,I dare bet it is more interesting than your usual small talk.It must,of course,be done with some tact and discretion.It is the mention of Laing's works which awoke the train of thought which led to these remarks.I had met some one at a table d'hôte or elsewhere who made some remark about the prehistoric remains in the valley of the Somme.I knew all about those,and showed him that I did.I then threw out some allusion to the rock temples of Yucatan,which he instantly picked up and enlarged upon.He spoke of ancient Peruvian civilization,and I kept well abreast of him.I cited the Titicaca image,and he knew all about that.He spoke of Quarternary man,and I was with him all the time.Each was more and more amazed at the fulness and the accuracy of the information of the other,until like a flash the explanation crossed my mind.“You are reading Samuel Laing’s‘Human Origins’！”I cried.So he was,and so by a coincidence was I.We were pouring water over each other,but it was all new-drawn from the spring.

There is a big two-volumed book at the end of my science shelf which would,even now,have its right to be called scientific disputed by some of the pedants.It is Myers'“Human Personality.”My own opinion,for what it is worth,is that it will be recognized a century hence as a great root book,one from which a whole new branch of science will have sprung.Where between four covers will you find greater evidence of patience,of industry,of thought,of discrimination,of that sweep of mind which can gather up a thousand separate facts and bind them all in the meshes of a single consistent system?Darwin has not been a more ardent collector in zoology than Myers in the dim regions of psychic research,and his whole hypothesis,so new that a new nomenclature and terminology had to be invented to express it,telepathy,the subliminal,and the rest of it,will always be a monument of acute reasoning expressed in fine prose,and founded upon ascertained fact.

The mere suspicion of scientific thought or scientific methods has a great charm in any branch of literature,however far it may be removed from actual research.Poe's tales,for example,owe much to this effect,though in his case it was a pure illusion.Jules Verne also produces a charmingly credible effect for the most incredible things by an adept use of a considerable amount of real knowledge of nature.But most gracefully of all does it shine in the lighter form of essay,where playful thoughts draw their analogies and illustrations from actual fact,each showing up the other,and the combination presenting a peculiar piquancy to the reader.

Where could I get a better illustration of what I mean than in those three little volumes which make up Wendell Holmes'immortal series，“The Autocrat，”“The Poet，”and“The Professor at the Breakfast Table”?Here the subtle,dainty,delicate thought is continually reinforced by the allusion or the analogy which shows the wide,accurate knowledge behind it.What work it is,how wise,how witty,how large-hearted and tolerant！Could one choose one's philosopher in the Elysian fields,as once in Athens,I would surely join the smiling group who listened to the human,kindly words of the Sage of Boston.I suppose it is just that continual leaven of science,especially of medical science,which has from my early student days given those books so strong an attraction for me.Never have I so known and loved a man whom I had never seen.It was one of the ambitions of my lifetime to look upon his face,but by the irony of Fate I arrived in his native city just in time to lay a wreath upon his newly-turned grave.Read his books again,and see if you are not especially struck by the up-to-dateness of them.Like Tennyson's“In Memoriam”it seems to me to be work which sprang into full flower fifty years before its time.One can hardly open a page haphazard without lighting upon some passage which illustrates the breadth of view,the felicity of phrase,and the singular power of playful but most suggestive analogy.Here,for example,is a paragraph—no better than a dozen others—which combines all the rare qualities—

Insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind overtasked.Good mental machinery ought to break its own wheels and levers,if anything is thrust upon them suddenly which tends to stop them or reverse their motion.A weak mind does not accumulate force enough to hurt itself；stupidity often saves a man from going mad.We frequently see persons in insane hospitals,sent there in consequence of what are called religious mental disturbances.I confess that I think better of them than of many who hold the same notions,and keep their wits and enjoy life very well,outside of the asylums.Any decent person ought to go mad if he really holds such and such opinions…….Anything that is brutal,cruel,heathenish,that makes life hopeless for the most of mankind,and perhaps for entire races—anything that assumes the necessity for the extermination of instincts which were given to be regulated—no matter by what name you call it—no matter whether a fakir,or a monk,or a deacon believes it—if received,ought to produce insanity in every well-regulated mind.

There's a fine bit of breezy polemics for the dreary fifties—a fine bit of moral courage too for the University professor who ventured to say it.

I put him above Lamb as an essayist,because there is a flavor of actual knowledge and of practical acquaintance with the problems and affairs of life,which is lacking in the elfin Londoner.I do not say that the latter is not the rarer quality.There are my“Essays of Elia，”and they are well-thumbed as you see,so it is not because I love Lamb less that I love this other more.Both are exquisite,but Wendell Holmes is for ever touching some note which awakens an answering vibration within my own mind.

The essay must always be a somewhat repellent form of literature,unless it be handled with the lightest and deftest touch.It is too reminiscent of the school themes of our boyhood—to put a heading and then to show what you can get under it.Even Stevenson,for whom I have the most profound admiration,finds it difficult to carry the reader through a series of such papers,adorned with his original thought and quaint turn of phrase.Yet his“Men and Books”and“Virginibus Puerisque”are high examples of what may be done in spite of the inherent unavoidable difficulty of the task.

But his style！Ah,if Stevenson had only realized how beautiful and nervous was his own natural God-given style he would never have been at pains to acquire another！It is sad to read the much-lauded anecdote of his imitating this author and that,picking up and dropping,in search of the best.The best is always the most natural.When Stevenson becomes a conscious stylist,applauded by so many critics,he seems to me like a man who,having most natural curls,will still conceal them under a wig.The moment he is precious he loses his grip.But when he will abide by his own sterling Lowland Saxon,with the direct word and the short,cutting sentence,I know not where in recent years we may find his mate.In this strong,plain setting the occasional happy word shines like a cut jewel.A really good stylist is like Beau Brummell's description of a well-dressed man—so dressed that no one would ever observe him.The moment you begin to remark a man's style the odds are that there is something the matter with it.It is a clouding of the crystal—a diversion of the reader's mind from the matter to the manner,from the author's subject to the author himself.

No,I have not the Edinburgh edition.If you think of a presentation—but I should be the last to suggest it.Perhaps on the whole I would prefer to have him in scattered books,rather than in a complete set.The half is more than the whole of most authors,and not the least of him.I am sure that his friends who reverenced his memory had good warrant and express instructions to publish this complete edition—very possibly it was arranged before his lamented end.Yet,speaking generally,I would say that an author was best served by being very carefully pruned before being exposed to the winds of time.Let every weak twig,every immature shoot be shorn away,and nothing but strong,sturdy,well-seasoned branches left.So shall the whole tree stand strong for years to come.How false an impression of the true Stevenson would our critical grandchild acquire if he chanced to pick down any one of half a dozen of these volumes！As we watched his hand stray down the rank how we would pray that it might alight upon the ones we love,on the“New Arabian Nights，”“The Ebb Tide，”“The Wrecker，”“Kidnapped，”or“Treasure Island.”These can surely never lose their charm.

What noble books of their class are those last，“Kidnapped”and“Treasure Island”！both,as you see,shining forth upon my lower shelf.“Treasure Island”is the better story,while I could imagine that“Kidnapped”might have the more permanent value as being an excellent and graphic sketch of the state of the Highlands after the last Jacobite insurrection.Each contains one novel and admirable character,Alan Breck in the one,and Long John in the other.Surely John Silver,with his face the size of a ham,and his little gleaming eyes like crumbs of glass in the center of it,is the king of all seafaring desperadoes.Observe how the strong effect is produced in his case,seldom by direct assertion on the part of the story-teller,but usually by comparison,innuendo,or indirect reference.The objectionable Billy Bones is haunted by the dread of“a seafaring man with one leg.”Captain Flint,we are told,was a brave man；“he was afraid of none,not he,only Silver—Silver was that genteel.”Or,again,where John himself says，“there was some that was feared of Pew,and some that was feared of Flint；but Flint his own self was feared of me.Feared he was,and proud.They was the roughest crew afloat was Flint's.The devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them.Well,now,I will tell you.I'm not a boasting man,and you seen yourself how easy I keep company；but when I was quartermaster,lambs wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers.”So by a touch here,and a hint there,there grows upon us the individuality of the smooth-tongued,ruthless,masterful,one-legged devil.He is to us not a creation of fiction,but an organic living reality with whom we have come in contact；such is the effect of the fine suggestive strokes with which he is drawn.And the buccaneers themselves,how simple,and yet how effective are the little touches which indicate their ways of thinking and of acting.“I want to go in that cabin,I do；I want their pickles and wine and that.”“Now,if you had sailed along of Bill you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke twice—not you.That was never Bill’s way,not the way of such as sailed with him.”Scott’s buccaneers in“The Pirate”are admirable,but they lack something human which we find here.It will be long before John Silver loses his place in sea fiction，“and you may lay to that.”

Stevenson was deeply influenced by Meredith,and even in these books the influence of the master is apparent.There is the apt use of an occasional archaic or unusual word,the short,strong descriptions,the striking metaphors,the somewhat staccato fashion of speech.Yet,in spite of this flavor,they have quite individuality enough to constitute a school of their own.Their faults,or rather perhaps their limitations,lie never in the execution,but entirely in the original conception.They picture only one side of life,and that a strange and exceptional one.There is no female interest.We feel that it is an apotheosis of the boy-story—the penny number of our youth in excelsis.But it is all so good,so fresh,so picturesque,that,however limited its scope,it still retains a definite and well-assured place in literature.There is no reason why“Treasure Island”should not be to the rising generation of the twenty-first century what“Robinson Crusoe”has been to that of the nineteenth.The balance of probability is all in that direction.

The modern masculine novel,dealing almost exclusively with the rougher,more stirring side of life,with the objective rather than the subjective,marks the reaction against the abuse of love in fiction.This one phase of life in its orthodox aspect,and ending in the conventional marriage,has been so hackneyed and worn to a shadow,that it is not to be wondered at that there is a tendency sometimes to swing to the other extreme,and to give it less than its fair share in the affairs of men.In British fiction nine books out of ten have held up love and marriage as the be-all and end-all of life.Yet we know,in actual practice,that this may not be so.In the career of the average man his marriage is an incident,and a momentous incident；but it is only one of several.He is swayed by many strong emotions；his business,his ambitions,his friendships,his struggles with the recurrent dangers and difficulties which tax a man's wisdom and his courage.Love will often play a subordinate part in his life.How many go through the world without ever loving at all?It jars upon us then to have it continually held up as the predominating,all-important fact in life；and there is a not unnatural tendency among a certain school,of which Stevenson is certainly the leader,to avoid altogether a source of interest which has been so misused and overdone.If all love-making were like that between Richard Feverel and Lucy Desborough,then indeed we could not have too much of it；but to be made attractive once more the passion must be handled by some great master who has courage to break down conventionalities and to go straight to actual life for his inspiration.

The use of the novel and piquant forms of speech is one of the most obvious of Stevenson's devices.No man handles his adjectives with greater judgment and nicer discrimination.There is hardly a page of his work where we do not come across words and expressions which strike us with a pleasant sense of novelty,and yet express the meaning with admirable conciseness.“His eyes came coasting round to me.”It is dangerous to begin quoting,as the examples are interminable,and each suggests another.Now and then he misses his mark,but it is very seldom.As an example,an“eye-shot”does not commend itself as a substitute for“a glance，”and“to teehee”for“to giggle”grates somewhat upon the ear,though the authority of Chaucer might be cited for the expressions.

Next in order is his extraordinary faculty for the use of pithy similes,which arrest the attention and stimulate the imagination.“His voice sounded hoarse and awkward,like a rusty lock.”“I saw her sway,like something stricken by the wind.”“His laugh rang false,like a cracked bell.”“His voice shook like a taut rope.”“My mind flying like a weaver's shuttle.”“His blows resounded on the grave as thick as sobs.”“The private guilty considerations I would continually observe to peep forth in the man's talk like rabbits from a hill.”Nothing could be more effective than these direct and homely comparisons.

After all,however,the main characteristic of Stevenson is his curious instinct for saying in the briefest space just those few words which stamp the impression upon the reader's mind.He will make you see a thing more clearly than you would probably have done had your eyes actually rested upon it.Here are a few of these word-pictures,taken haphazard from among hundreds of equal merit—

Not far off Macconochie was standing with his tongue out of his mouth,and his hand upon his chin,like a dull fellow thinking hard.

Stewart ran after us for more than a mile,and I could not help laughing as I looked back at last and saw him on a hill,holding his hand to his side,and nearly burst with running.

Ballantrae turned to me with a face all wrinkled up,and his teeth all showing in his mouth…….He said no word,but his whole appearance was a kind of dreadful question.

Look at him,if you doubt；look at him,grinning and gulping,a detected thief.

He looked me all over with a warlike eye,and I could see the challenge on his lips.

What could be more vivid than the effect produced by such sentences as these?

There is much more that might be said as to Stevenson's peculiar and original methods in fiction.As a minor point,it might be remarked that he is the inventor of what may be called the mutilated villain.It is true that Mr.Wilkie Collins has described one gentleman who had not only been deprived of all his limbs,but was further afflicted by the insupportable name of Miserrimus Dexter.Stevenson,however,has used the effect so often,and with such telling results,that he may be said to have made it his own.To say nothing of Hyde,who was the very impersonation of deformity,there is the horrid blind Pew,Black Dog with two fingers missing,Long John with his one leg,and the sinister catechist who is blind but shoots by ear,and smites about him with his staff.In“The Black Arrow，”too,there is another dreadful creature who comes tapping along with a stick.Often as he has used the device,he handles it so artistically that it never fails to produce its effect.

Is Stevenson a classic?Well,it is a large word that.You mean by a classic a piece of work which passes into the permanent literature of the country.As a rule you only know your classics when they are in their graves.Who guessed it of Poe,and who of Borrow?The Roman Catholics only canonize their saints a century after their death.So with our classics.The choice lies with our grandchildren.But I can hardly think that healthy boys will ever let Stevenson's books of adventure die,nor do I think that such a short tale as“The Pavilion on the Links”nor so magnificent a parable as“Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde”will ever cease to be esteemed.How well I remember the eagerness,the delight with which I read those early tales in“Cornhill”away back in the late seventies and early eighties.They were unsigned,after the old unfair fashion,but no man with any sense of prose could fail to know that they were all by the same author.Only years afterwards did I learn who that author was.

I have Stevenson's collected poems over yonder in the small cabinet.Would that he had given us more！Most of them are the merest playful sallies of a freakish mind.But one should,indeed,be a classic,for it is in my judgment by all odds the best narrative ballad of the last century—that is if I am right in supposing that“The Ancient Mariner”appeared at the very end of the eighteenth.I would put Coleridge's tour de force of grim fancy first,but I know none other to compare in glamour and phrase and easy power with“Ticonderoga.”Then there is his immortal epitaph.The two pieces alone give him a niche of his own in our poetical literature,just as his character gives him a niche of his own in our affections.No,I never met him.But among my most prized possessions are several letters which I received from Samoa.From that distant tower he kept a surprisingly close watch upon what was doing among the bookmen,and it was his hand which was among the first held out to the striver,for he had quick appreciation and keen sympathies which met another man's work half way,and wove into it a beauty from his own mind.

And now,my very patient friend,the time has come for us to part,and I hope my little sermons have not bored you over-much.If I have put you on the track of anything which you did not know before,then verify it and pass it on.If I have not,there is no harm done,save that my breath and your time have been wasted.There may be a score of mistakes in what I have said—is it not the privilege of the conversationalist to misquote?My judgments may differ very far from yours,and my likings may be your abhorrence；but the mere thinking and talking of books is in itself good,be the upshot what it may.For the time the magic door is still shut.You are still in the land of faerie.But,alas,though you shut that door,you cannot seal it.Still come the ring of the bell,the call of the telephone,the summons back to the sordid world of work and men and daily strife.Well,that's the real life after all—this only the imitation.And yet,now that the portal is wide open and we stride out together,do we not face our fate with a braver heart for all the rest and quiet and comradeship that we found behind the Magic Door?
