第一章


一座低矮的灰色建筑，仅仅有三十四层。大门之上写着几个大字：“中央伦敦孵化与条件训练中心”，大字旁边的盾形图案上刻着世界国的座右铭：“集体，同一，稳定”。

一楼的这个大房间是朝北的。薄薄的一束强光直射入窗户，尽管窗玻璃外就是夏天，尽管房间本身异常炎热，但光线依然清冷，它似乎在贪婪地搜寻着室内某个身穿大褂的人体模型，某个做学术研究而令人起鸡皮疙瘩的苍白形象，可是，它只发现了实验室里常见的玻璃器皿、镍器和泛着冷光的陶瓷。室内的冰冷感映衬着光线的寒意。工作人员们的罩衫是白色的，他们手上戴的橡胶手套是死尸般的惨白。于是，光线冻住了，死了，成了幽灵。只有当透过显微镜的黄色筒身后，它才获得了某种丰富的、活生生的实质，看上去如同黄油一样，映在擦得锃亮的试管上。这些试管便呈现为一道接一道的明亮光线，向工作台的远处延伸开去。

“这里，”主任推开了房门，“就是受精室。”

孵化与条件训练中心的主任进屋时，三百个孕育员正俯身在仪器上忙碌着，大家都全神贯注，屏息静气，间或有人心不在焉地喃喃自语般哼出声来，或者吹声口哨。一大群学生刚刚来到这里，他们都很年轻，脸蛋红扑扑的，一副乳臭未干的样子。他们紧张地、噤若寒蝉般跟在主任的身后，每个人都拿个笔记本，只要这个大人物一说话，他们就马上拼命记下来。这可是直接受教于权威人士啊，是不可多得的特权。中央伦敦孵化与条件训练中心的主任一向认为必须亲自带领新生们参观各个部门。

“只是为了让你们有个大概的了解。”他总是这样向学生们解释。如果要让他们将来工作得明白，当然必须得有个大概的了解，可是，如果他们将来只是要成为驯服而快乐的社会成员的话，那么，这个了解还是越少越好。因为，众所周知，具体细节有助于造就德行和幸福，而总体概况只是学习过程中的必要之恶。构成社会脊梁的不是哲学家们，而是那些细木工和集邮的人。

“明天，”主任接着说，他对学生微笑着，和蔼之中透着一丝威胁的意味，“你们就要安下心来，正儿八经地工作，没有多少时间了解全局了，同时……”

同时呢，这可是一大特权呀。从权威人士之口，直接记到笔记本上。学生们发疯般地做着笔记。

主任进入房间，他高高瘦瘦的身子非常挺拔。他长着长长的下巴，大而突出的牙齿，不说话的时候，丰满红润、曲线优美的嘴唇刚刚能够盖住他的牙齿。他是年老还是年轻？是三十还是五十？还是五十五？很难说。反正这个问题也没有人提出来。在这个安稳的年代，在福特纪元632年，没有人想得起要问一问年龄问题。

“我就从头说起吧。”孵化与条件训练中心主任说，于是那些更积极的学生就在笔记本上记录下了他的意图：“从头说起”。他挥了挥手说：“这些就是孵化器。”他打开一扇绝缘门，向他们展示一架架编了号的试管，并解释道：“这些是本周供应的卵子，保持在血液的温度，而那些雄性配偶子，”他一边说着，一边又打开另一扇门，“它们必须保持在35度，而不是37度。正常的血液温度会使它们失去生育能力。”包裹在发热器里的公羊是繁殖不了小羊羔的。

主任身子仍然靠在孵化器上，他给学生们简略介绍了现代的受精过程，同时，铅笔在纸上飞快地记录着，字迹潦草难辨。当然，主任首先谈到整个受精过程的开端——外科手术：“为了社会的利益自愿进行的手术，更不用提做这个手术可以拿到相当于六个月工资的奖金”；接着，他比较详细地介绍了使已经剥离的卵巢存活并持续发育的技术；转而谈到保持最佳温度、盐度和黏稠度方面的考虑；又谈及保存那些分离出来且已经成熟的卵子的液体。主任把学生们领到工作台前面，给他们示范了如何从试管里提取这种液体；如何将液体一滴一滴地注到专门加过温的显微镜载玻片上；如何对液体里的卵子进行检查，以防有异常，之后又如何进行计数，并将它们转移到一个透气的容器里；如何（他带他们去观察这项操作）将这个容器浸没到一种含有自由游动的精子的温暖肉汤中——他还特别强调，这种肉汤中的精子浓度至少要达到每立方厘米十万个；十分钟之后，又如何将容器从液体中取出，重新检查其中的物质；如果有卵子没能成功受精，如何将这个容器再一次浸到液体中，如果有必要，还要重复一次；如何将受精卵放回孵化器；阿尔法们和贝塔们将要待在孵化器里，直到最后装瓶；而仅仅三十六个小时之后，伽马们、德尔塔们和艾普西隆们就要再次被取出，进入波卡诺夫斯基程序。

“波卡诺夫斯基程序。”主任重复了一遍，学生们也在各自的小笔记本上给这个词划上线。

一个卵子，发育成一个胚胎，长成一个成人，这是正常情况。但是，一个经历了波卡诺夫斯基程序的卵子会萌芽，会增殖，会分裂，会形成八个到九十六个胚芽，每个胚芽都会发育一个完整的胚胎，每个胚胎可以长成一个完整的成人。过去只能长成一个成人，而现在是九十六个。这就是进步。

中心主任总结道：“归根结底，波卡诺夫斯基化就是指人工干预抑制卵子正常发育的一系列生长阶段。我们抑制正常的发育，但奇怪的是，卵子的反应却是萌芽。”

“反应是萌芽”。铅笔忙着记录。

主任指点着。在一个缓慢移动的传送带上，一个摆满试管的架子正在进入一个巨大的金属柜，另一个满载试管的架子则正从柜子里冒出来。机器发出微弱的嗡嗡声。主任告诉他们，这些试管通过柜子需要八分钟。八分钟的X光强光照射是卵子所能承受的最大限度了。有些卵子死去；其他的呢，最不敏感的卵子会分裂为两个；大多数分裂为四个；有些则是八个；所有卵子会返回到孵化器，在孵化器里，这些分裂出来的胚芽开始发育；两天后，给这些胚芽突然降温，降温后，它们的发育受到抑制。于是，这些胚芽再次分裂，两个，四个，八个；分裂后，给它们用上酒精，它们的生长再次受到抑制，几乎死去；但是，随之而来的却是再次萌芽，就这样，新胚芽中又分裂出新胚芽。完成这些之后，就要让这些胚芽自由生长了——因为若还对它们的发育加以抑制的话，它们可就真死掉了。此时，最初的一个卵子变成了多个胚胎，从八个到九十六个不等——不得不承认，这可真是对自然生长过程的一大改良啊。一模一样的多胞胎，不是古老的胎生时期那可怜兮兮的双胞胎或三胞胎，那是卵子偶然分裂时出现的情况，而现在呢，每个卵子每次分裂为几十个，甚至百十来个。

“百十来个，”主任重复了一遍，同时伸展开双臂，好像在慷慨地分发赏金，“百十来个啊。”

但是，一个学生却愚蠢至极，竟然提问这么做的好处是什么。

“我的好孩子！”主任突然转身面向他，“你真看不出来吗？难道你真看不出来吗？”他抬起一只手，表情庄重，“波卡诺夫斯基程序是维持社会稳定的一大利器呀！”

“维持社会稳定的一大利器”。

标准化的男人和女人，每一批都一模一样。整个小工厂的工人都是由一个经历了波卡诺夫斯基程序的卵子发育成的。

“九十六个一模一样的多胞胎操控九十六台一模一样的机器！”他的声音因为激动而几乎有些颤抖，“你们现在真正了解你们所处的时代了吧。这是历史上第一次啊。”他引用了一下全球座右铭，“集体，同一，稳定。”至理名言。“如果我们将波卡诺夫斯基程序无限进行下去，所有问题就都能得到解决了。”

这些问题在规范一致的伽马们、一成不变的德尔塔们和一模一样的艾普西隆们身上得到解决。数以百万计的一模一样的多胞胎。大规模生产的原则终于应用到了生物学上。

“不过，唉，”主任摇了摇头说，“我们无法将波卡诺夫斯基程序无限进行下去。”

九十六个似乎就已经是上限了，七十二个就是很不错的平均数。使用同一个卵巢和同一个男性的精子，生产出尽可能多批次的完全一样的多胞胎，这就是他们所能取得的最好成绩了（遗憾的是，这仅是第二好的成绩）。即便要取得这个成绩，也是非常困难的。

“这是因为，在自然状态下，两百个卵子要发育成熟，需要三十年。但是，我们的任务是维持目前的人口数量，就是当前的这个数量。如果我们在二十多年里才能零零星星地培育几个多胞胎，那又有什么用呢？”

显而易见，毫无用处。但是波兹耐普技术已经大大加快了卵子的成熟进程。他们现在能够做到在两年内使至少一百五十个卵子发育成熟，然后，给它们受精，再进行波卡诺夫斯基程序，换句话说，乘以七十二，这样就可以生产出一百五十批一模一样的多胞胎，这些兄弟姐妹的数目平均几乎可以达到一万一千个，他们的年龄大致相当，最多也相差不过两岁。

“在极例外的情况下，我们可以用一个卵巢培育出一万五千多个成人。”

主任向一个脸色红润、一头金发的年轻人招招手，他正巧从这里经过。主任叫住他：“福斯特先生。”年轻人走了过来。“福斯特先生，你能告诉我们单个卵巢的最高纪录吗？”

福斯特先生毫不犹豫地回答：“我们中心的最高纪录是一万六千零十二个。”他语速很快，长着一双活泼的蓝眼睛，很明显，他以引用数字为乐。“一万六千零十二个，一百八十九个批次的多胞胎。当然，在一些热带地区的中心，他们做得比我们好得多。”他继续侃侃而谈，“在新加坡，他们经常能够超过一万六千五百个，蒙巴萨那里实际上已经达到了一万七千个的水平，但他们有优势啊，这对我们不太公平。你们真应该看看黑人的卵巢对垂体制剂的反应！如果你们在工作中习惯了这些欧洲材料，你们一定会大吃一惊的。不过，”他笑了一声（但他的眼睛里闪着战斗的光芒，下巴也挑战般地微微抬起来），接着说，“不过，我们还是想尽量超过他们的。我目前就正在培育一个超级棒的德尔塔－(1)卵巢呢，刚刚十八个月，可是已经有了两千七百多个子女，有的已经换瓶了，有的还是胚胎呢。这个卵巢还很健壮呢，我们一定会超过他们的。”

“这才是我喜欢的精神！”主任喊道，他拍拍福斯特先生的肩膀，“跟我们一起来，给这些男孩传授一下你的专业知识吧。”

福斯特先生谦逊地笑了笑：“荣幸之至。”他们一块往前走。

装瓶室里一片繁忙，但一切都井然有序。切成适当大小的新鲜母猪腹膜片正通过小电梯，从位于地下室二层的器官库里一片片地运送上来，嗖的一声，然后，咔嗒！电梯上的小口打开，装瓶人员只需伸出手，抓住腹膜片，塞到瓶中，把它按平。已经装好的瓶子还没有沿着传送带走出多远，嗖，咔嗒，另一片腹膜片又从下面冒出来，只等着装入下一个瓶子，无穷无尽的传送带上没完没了的行列中的下一个环节。

装瓶员旁边站着的便是录入员。传送带缓慢行进着，卵子被一个一个地从试管里转移到瓶子里。录入员们动作娴熟：剖开腹膜片，植入桑葚胚，倒入盐溶液……这时，瓶子已经移开了，下面的工作就由标签员来做。遗传情况、受精日期和波卡诺夫斯基组别等详细信息从试管上转移到了瓶子上。这些卵子不再是无名小卒，有了名字，标明了身份，然后，行列继续缓慢前行，通过墙上的一个开口，慢慢进入社会命运预定室。

他们边往里面走，福斯特先生边津津有味地介绍：“这里有八十八立方米的索引卡片。”

“包含了所有的相关信息。”主任补充道。

“每天上午进行信息更新。”

“每天下午进行信息协调。”

“在协调信息后，他们进行各种计算。”

“计算共有多少个体，属于哪一种品质。”福斯特先生说。

“以什么样的数量进行分配。”

“某一时刻的最佳换瓶比率。”

“如有未能预见的损耗，立即加以弥补。”

“立即。”福斯特先生重复了一遍，“你们可以想象一下，上次日本地震后，我得加多长时间的班啊！”他快活地笑出声来，摇了摇头。

“命运预定员把他们算出的数据传送给孕育员。”

“孕育员就把命运预定员需要的胚胎交给他们。”

“那些瓶子就来到这里，对胚胎的命运进行详细设定。”

“之后，胚胎就被送到胚胎库。”

“我们现在就要去那里。”

福斯特先生打开一扇门，领着他们下了楼梯，走向地下室。

这里依然酷热。他们走下去，周围光线越来越暗。通过两道门，之后又沿一条通道拐两个弯，这就保证了地下室里即使在白天也不会有一丝光线射入。

“胚胎就像胶卷一样，”福斯特先生开玩笑地说，推开了第二道门，“它们只受得了红光。”

实际上，学生们跟着他步入的这个房间既闷热又黑暗，但是，这却是一种看得见的深红色的黑暗，就如同夏日的午后，当我们闭上眼睛后，依然能够感觉到的那种暗红。这里，一排又一排、一层又一层地码放着数不尽的瓶子，瓶身饱满，熠熠闪光，如同数不清的红宝石。一些男男女女的模糊身影如同幽灵一般，在这些红宝石中间走来走去，他们的眼睛呈现紫红色，仿佛患了红斑狼疮一样。机器的嗡嗡声和咔嗒声微微地搅动着空气。

“告诉他们一些数字吧，福斯特先生。”主任说，他自己已经厌烦讲话了。

这正合福斯特先生之意，他巴不得引用一些数字呢。

这个房间有两百二十米长，两百米宽，十米高。他向上指了指。学生们就像喝水的鸡崽，一起抬头望向远处的天花板。

共有三层架子：地面层，长廊一层，长廊二层。

蜘蛛网状的钢架长廊一层上面还有一层，向各个方向延伸开去，直到消失在黑暗中。长廊附近，三个红色的人影正忙着从传送梯上卸下一些细颈大肚瓶。

这是从社会命运预定室过来的电梯。

每个瓶子都分别被放在一个架子上，共有十五个架子。每个架子实际上都是一个传送带，以每小时三十三又三分之一厘米的速度移动，虽然这一点看不出来。每天移动八米，共需要两百六十七天，移动距离总共是两千一百三十六米。在地下室的巡回路线中，一条线路在地面层，另一条在长廊一层，还有半条在长廊二层。在第两百六十七天的早上，日光进入换瓶室。胚胎们从此有了所谓的“独立生命”。

“在这期间呢，”福斯特先生总结道，“我们可以对胚胎做很多事情，啊，非常多的事情。”他的笑声中带着心照不宣的得意。

“这才是我喜欢的精神。”主任又一次说道，“我们四处走走吧，你把一切都给他们讲讲，福斯特先生。”

于是，福斯特先生就给他们讲开了。

给他们讲了着床在腹膜片上的渐渐长大的胚胎；让他们尝了一下胚胎赖以生存的营养丰富的代血浆；解释了为什么需要用胎盘素和甲状腺素来刺激胚胎；告诉了他们什么是黄体提取物，并带他们参观了在从起点到两千零四十米处的进程中，每隔十二米自动给胚胎注射这种提取物；讲解了在最后九十六米内要逐渐加大垂体腺素的剂量；描述了在一百一十二米处安装在每个瓶子里的人工母体循环；展示了代血浆储存库，以及使代血浆不断流入胎盘、穿过合成肺和废物过滤器的离心泵；提及了胚胎容易患贫血的麻烦毛病，以及胚胎必需的大量猪胃提取液和马驹肝提取物。

带他们参观了一个简单的装置，这个装置在每八米的最后两米内，会自动地晃动所有胚胎，让胚胎熟悉运动的感觉；向他们指出了所谓的“换瓶创伤”的严重性，列举了通过对瓶中的胚胎进行适当的条件训练尽可能降低这种危险震荡的各种措施；告诉了他们在两百米左右进行的性别测试；解释了贴标签的方法——字母T表示男性，圆圈表示女性，而对那些被命运预定为不孕女的胚胎，则在白底上标上黑色的问号。

“当然，”福斯特先生说，“在绝大多数胚胎那里，有生育能力只不过是一件麻烦事。对我们而言，一千两百个卵巢中，有一个具有生育能力就完全够用了。但是，我们想要更大的选择性，当然了，我们总得留下足够大的余地，因此，我们就允许百分之三十的女性胚胎正常发育。至于其他的胚胎，在剩下的进程中，每隔二十四米就给它们注射雄性荷尔蒙。结果就是，换瓶的时候，它们就成了不孕女，身体构造上是完全正常的（只有一点，他必须承认，她们比较容易长胡子），但却没有生育能力。保证她们没有生育能力，这一点，”福斯特先生接着说，“终于让我们摆脱了对大自然的奴隶式的模仿，进入了更有趣的人工干预的世界。”

他搓了搓手。当然，他们并不会仅仅满足于孵化出胚胎，连母牛都可以做到这一点呢。

“我们还预定胚胎的命运，并进行相应的条件训练。在给婴儿们换瓶时，它们就已经成为社会化的个体了，不管是阿尔法还是艾普西隆，是未来的下水道工人还是未来的……”他刚要说“未来的世界控制官”，但马上改口说“未来的孵化中心主任”。

孵化与条件训练中心主任微微一笑，接受了这个恭维。

他们现在正在走过十一号架的三百二十米处。一个年轻的贝塔－机修工手拿螺丝刀和扳手，在一个正在通过的瓶子的代血浆泵上鼓捣着。他每拧一下螺丝，电动马达的嗡嗡声就变得更低沉一点，低点，再低点……最后又拧了一下，他瞅了一眼转速表，大功告成。他沿着传送带向前走了两步，在另一个泵上开始了同样的操作。

“他在减少每分钟转动的圈数，”福斯特先生解释道，“这样，代血浆就流得慢一点，流过肺部的时间间隔也就更长一点，提供给胚胎的氧气量便相应减少。没有什么做法比减少氧气量更能降低胚胎的标准了。”他又搓了搓手。

“可为什么要降低胚胎的标准呢？”一个心直口快的学生问。

“哎呀！”在一阵长时间的沉默后，主任开腔了，“难道你没有想到过吗？艾普西隆的胚胎不仅需要艾普西隆的遗传基因，也需要艾普西隆的环境啊。”

显然，这个学生没有想到这一点，他立即变得惶恐不安。

“种姓等级越低，”福斯特先生说，“氧气供应时间越短。”首先受到影响的器官就是大脑，之后是骨架。如果只提供正常氧气量的百分之七十，最后形成的就是侏儒；当氧气供应量低于百分之七十，形成的就是没有眼睛的怪物了。

“那就毫无用处了。”福斯特先生总结道。

而同时呢（他的声音变得急切，又有点透露秘密的意味），如果他们能够找到一种缩短胚胎成熟周期的技术，对社会来说，那将是多么大的胜利，多么大的贡献呀！

“想想马的情况吧。”

他们便开始考虑马的情况。

马六岁就成熟，大象则是十岁成熟。而人类呢，十三岁时还没有达到性成熟，二十岁时才真正成熟。当然，人类的迟缓发育有一个成果——较高的智慧。

“但是，在艾普西隆身上，”福斯特先生说得很对，“我们并不需要人类的智慧。”

不需要，自然也就得不到。虽然艾普西隆的头脑在十岁时已经发育成熟，但是他们的身体却需要等到十八岁才适合工作。这么多年的待成熟阶段都是多余的，白白浪费掉了。如果能够加快他们身体的发育，比如做到和母牛的发育一样快，那对社会将是多么了不起的节约呀！

“了不起！”学生们喃喃地念叨着。福斯特先生的热情非常具有感染力。

他的讲解变得更加专业，他谈起了导致人类发育迟缓的内分泌失调问题，以及造成这种现象的基因突变方面的假设。能否消除这种基因突变的不利后果？能否通过适当的技术手段，让单个艾普西隆胚胎倒退回狗和母牛的正常发育水平？这就是问题所在，还亟待解决。

蒙巴萨的皮尔金顿已经培育出四岁达到性成熟、六岁半就完全长大成人的胚胎个体。科学界的一大胜利啊，可惜对社会来讲一无是处。六岁大的男女还太愚笨，连艾普西隆的工作也干不了。这个研究过程可谓“不成功便成仁”：要么一点也改变不了，要么就全盘改变。他们仍然在努力寻求二十岁成人和六岁成人之间的理想平衡点，但至今为止毫无进展。福斯特先生叹了口气，摇摇头。

他们在暗红的阴影里走动着，来到了九号架的一百七十米处附近，从此处开始，九号架就被围起来，那些瓶子会在围成的隧道里走完随后的行程，每隔两到三米，隧道会有一个开口。

“耐热训练。”福斯特先生说。

热隧道与冷隧道交替出现。在低温之上，还要加上强烈X光照射带来的不适感。等到换瓶的时候，这些胚胎已经对低温产生了恐惧。它们的命运已经被预定，要被移民到热带地区，做矿工、醋酸人造丝纺织工人或钢铁工人。稍后，会对它们的头脑进行条件训练，使其适应身体的感觉。“我们的训练会让它们在高温下也茁壮发达，”福斯特先生总结道，“我们楼上的同事会教它们喜欢高温。”

“这个，”主任简短地说，“这个就是幸福和德行的秘诀呀——喜爱自己必须要做的事情。这也是我们所有条件训练的目的——让人们喜欢上他们不能逃避的社会命运。”

在两条隧道的间隙处，一个护士正在将一根细长的注射器小心地插入一个经过的瓶子中的胶状物质。学生们和为他们讲解的两个向导站在那里，默默地看了一会儿。

“嗨，列宁娜。”福斯特说，他看见她终于把针头拔出，站直了身子。

女孩吃惊地转过身。尽管光线令她显出患红斑狼疮的模样，眼睛还呈现出紫色，人们还是能够看出来，她可不是一般的漂亮。

“亨利！”她对他咧嘴笑笑，一个红色的微笑，露出一排珊瑚般的牙齿。

“迷人，真迷人。”主任喃喃自语，轻轻地拍了她两三下，她这时露出的则是颇为恭敬的微笑。

“你在给它们注射什么？”福斯特问，尽量让自己的语气显得专业。

“哦，就是那些常规的伤寒和睡眠疾病疫苗。”

“在一百五十米处，就开始给热带的工人们注射疫苗了。”福斯特先生对学生们解释道，“胚胎们还长着鳃呢，我们给这些‘鱼’进行免疫，避免它们将来长大后染上疾病。”他转过去对列宁娜说：“下午四点五十分，楼顶上见，照旧。”

“真迷人。”主任重复了一遍，又拍了她一下后，跟着其他人一起离开了。

在十号架上，未来的化工工人正在接受条件训练，学着忍受铅、烧碱、焦油以及氯等的怪味；有两百五十个将来要成为火箭飞机技工的胚胎，它们中的第一个正在通过三号架的一千一百米处，一个特殊的装置不停地转动瓶子。“提高它们的平衡感。”福斯特先生解释道，“当火箭在半空飞行，在火箭的外部做修理工作可是件棘手的活儿。当胚胎头朝上的时候，我们减缓血浆的循环速度，让它们处于半饥饿状态；等它们头朝下的时候呢，我们就加倍供应代血浆。它们将学会将舒适感与倒立状态联系起来，实际上，它们只有头朝下的时候才真正开心呢。”

“现在，”福斯特先生继续说，“我想给你们看看对阿尔法＋知识分子们进行的非常有趣的条件训练。五号架上有一大批。在长廊一层上。”他叫住了两个正要往地面层走的男生。

“他们在大约九百米处。”他解释道，“只有等胚胎的尾巴退化以后，我们才能对他们进行一些智力方面的训练。跟我来。”

但是，主任看了看表，说道：“差十分三点，恐怕我们没有时间看知识分子胚胎了。我们必须趁着孩子们还没有从午睡中醒来，赶紧去趟育婴房了。”

福斯特先生有点失望。“至少得去换瓶室看一眼吧。”他央求道。

“好吧，”主任大度地笑笑，“就看一眼。”

第二章


福斯特先生留在换瓶室。孵化与条件训练中心主任和学生们步入最近的电梯，来到了五楼。

布告牌上写着：“育婴房，新巴甫洛夫(1)训练室”。

主任推开一道门，他们进入了一个宽敞空旷的大房间，阳光明媚，非常亮堂，因为它的整面南墙就是一扇大窗户。六七个护士穿着那种黏胶纤维的白色制服，上衣加长裤，在忙碌着，为避免细菌污染，她们的头发塞到了白色护士帽里面。她们正在地板上把一盆盆玫瑰花摆成一长排。花盆非常大，里面满满当当地盛开着花朵。有成千上万片花瓣，饱满，如丝般光滑，就像无数个小天使的脸蛋，不过，映照在明亮的阳光中的，不仅有雅利安小天使的粉红脸蛋，还有中国和墨西哥小天使们光洁的脸蛋，也有一些小脸蛋似乎因为吹奏天国的喇叭太多而有点中风的症状，显出死亡般的苍白，大理石般的惨白。

看到中心主任走进来，护士们站直了身子。

“把书摆上。”主任简短地吩咐。

护士们默默地听从他的吩咐，在玫瑰花盆中间摆上了书籍——一排四开本的儿歌图画书，每一本都翻开来，露出颜色鲜艳的动物，或者鱼儿，或者鸟儿，非常诱人。

“现在，把孩子们带进来。”

护士们匆匆离开房间，一两分钟之后，每人都推着类似小型升降机的那种小车进来，小车上面有四个网眼状的隔层，每个隔层上都满载着八个月大的婴儿，全都长得一模一样（很明显，属于一个波卡诺夫斯基组别），全都穿着卡其色的衣服（因为他们的种姓属于德尔塔）。

“把他们放在地板上。”

婴儿们被放了下来。

“现在，让他们转过身，能看到花和书。”

转过身后，婴儿们立即安静下来，然后开始往那些一簇一簇的漂亮色彩爬行，爬向那些白色页面上的鲜艳图案。他们爬着爬着，被云彩暂时遮蔽的太阳冒了出来，于是，玫瑰花显得更加绚烂了，好像由一股从里到外焕发的激情照耀着；那些闪亮的书页也仿佛充满一种崭新而深沉的意义。从正在爬行的婴儿行列里传出一阵阵兴奋的欢叫声、愉快的咯咯笑声和叽喳声。

主任搓了搓手。“太棒了！”他说，“这太阳出的，好像是故意安排的一样。”

爬得最快的婴儿已经到达他们的目标前面了，小手颤巍巍地伸出来，碰到了，抓住了，把容光焕发的玫瑰花瓣弄掉了，把闪亮的书页弄得皱巴巴的。主任等待着，看到所有婴儿都高兴地忙碌开了，才说：“仔细观察。”接着，他举起一只手，发出了信号。

护士长正站在房间另一头的一个配电盘旁边，她按下了一个小小的杠杆。

一声剧烈的爆炸声响起，接着，警报器呜呜地响起来了，一阵比一阵尖锐，警铃也突然开始发狂般地乱叫。

孩子们吓了一跳，尖叫起来，小脸儿因恐惧而扭曲变形。

“现在，”主任喊道（因为此时的噪音已经震耳欲聋），“现在，我们再给他们稍微用上点电击，让他们彻底记住这一课。”

他再次挥挥手，护士长按下了另一个杠杆。尖声哭叫的婴儿们突然变了一个腔调，开始抽搐着发出一声声短促尖厉的号叫，透着绝望，近于疯狂。他们小小的身躯抽动起来，变得僵硬，四肢也痉挛般地抽动，好像被看不见的电线牵扯着。

“我们可以把那整块地板都通上电。”主任喊着解释，“不过，这就够了。”他向那个护士做了个手势。

爆炸声停止了，警铃停止了，尖锐的警报声渐渐平息，一切都归于沉寂。孩子们僵硬的四肢停止了抽搐，慢慢放松了，他们像小疯子一样的抽泣和惊叫再次变成了婴儿受到惊吓时通常发出的那种嚎啕大哭。

“再把花和书给他们。”

护士们照着他的吩咐做了，但是，玫瑰花刚拿近一点，刚刚看到书页上那些色彩鲜艳的猫咪、大公鸡和咩咩叫的黑羊，孩子们马上吓得向后躲，哭叫声也突然变大。

“看吧，”主任得意地说，“注意观察。”

书籍与巨大的声响，花朵与电击，孩子们的头脑已经把二者给联系起来了，并且是对前者不利的联系。同样或类似的教训重复两百次之后，这个联系就密不可分了。这种人为的联系，大自然根本无力解开。

“他们长大以后，会对花和书有一种心理学家们称之为‘本能’的憎恶。这是经过条件训练后的本能反应，根本无法改变。他们一辈子都不会再碰书和植物了。”主任转向护士们：“把他们带走吧。”

依然哭叫着的卡其色婴儿们给装上小车推走了，身后留下一股发酸的牛奶味，一阵令人愉快的宁静。

一个学生举起手来，虽然他完全能明白为什么不能让种姓低贱的人读书，因为这会浪费集体的时间，他也明白他们读到的内容总有可能会破坏他们被训练出来的某个本能反应，这当然是一大危险，是不可取的，但是，他不懂关于这些花儿的训练。为什么大费周章地让德尔塔们从心理上不可能喜欢花儿呢？

中心主任耐心地进行解释。让孩子们一见到玫瑰花就尖叫，那是出于经济方面的考虑。不太久之前（大约一个世纪前吧），伽马们、德尔塔们，甚至艾普西隆们，都是要受到条件训练，去喜欢花儿的，具体讲是喜欢花儿，大致来讲就是喜欢野外的大自然。当时的观念是，让他们一有机会就想去乡间，这样就可以逼着他们在交通上消费。

“难道他们不在交通上花钱吗？”那个学生问道。

“非常多，”中心主任回答，“但除此之外，他们不花别的钱。”

他指出，报春花和美丽的风景有一个很大的缺陷，那就是，它们都是免费的。对大自然的热爱不会让任何一家工厂一直忙碌生产。人们决定，至少在下层阶级，要消除这种对大自然的热爱，但是，不消除他们花交通费的倾向。当然，尽管他们讨厌乡间，还是必须要让他们不断地往乡间去。可问题是，如何找到一个除了喜爱报春花和风景之外的理由，一个从经济学上来讲更合理的理由，让他们仍然在交通上花钱？后来，这个理由被找到了。

“我们训练大众憎恨乡下，”主任总结道，“但是，同时呢，我们却训练他们热爱所有的乡间运动。我们还保证所有的乡间运动都需要使用极其复杂的设施。这样，他们不仅在交通工具上消费，还要在工业产品上消费。正因为如此，才对婴儿们采用电击训练法。”

“我明白了。”那个学生说完，陷入沉默，心里佩服得不得了。

一阵沉默后，主任清清嗓子，说：“很久以前，我们的福帝(2)还在人世的时候，有一个叫鲁本·拉宾诺维奇的小男孩，他的父母是说波兰语的。”主任自己打了个岔，问，“你们应该知道波兰语吧？”

“一门死的语言。”

“和法语、德语一样。”另一个学生好事地插了一嘴，卖弄着自己的学问。

“那‘父母’呢？”主任又问。

一阵不安的沉默。几个男孩子脸都羞红了。他们还不能体会淫词秽语和纯粹科学之间那条至关重要但经常非常微妙的界限。最终，一个学生鼓足勇气，举起了一只手。

“人类过去是……”他迟疑着，血液一下子涌上了他的脸颊，“嗯，人类过去是胎生的。”

“非常正确。”主任赞许地点点头。

“当婴儿们换瓶的时候……”

“出生的时候。”主任纠正道。

“这样，他们就成为父母了，当然，我指的不是婴儿，是那两个人。”这个可怜的孩子慌乱得不知所措。

“一句话，”主任总结道，“父母就是父亲和母亲。”对男孩们来说，这实为科学的淫秽词语，犹如晴天霹雳，炸开了他们的沉默，他们的眼神因害羞而躲躲闪闪。主任身子往椅背上一靠，大声地重复了一句“母亲”，为的是让孩子们记住这个科学道理。“这些，”他严肃地说，“是令人不快的事实，我知道的。但是，大多数史实都令人不快呀。”

他又接着讲起小鲁本。有一天晚上，小鲁本的爸爸和妈妈（霹雳，又一声霹雳！）疏忽了，忘记关上他房间的收音机。

（“你们必须记得，在那些粗俗的胎生繁殖的日子里，孩子们总是由他们的父母养大的，而不是在国家训练中心长大。”）

这个小孩睡觉时，伦敦的一个广播节目突然开始了。第二天早晨，让他的“霹雳”和“霹雳”震惊的是（胆子大些的男孩子竟然开始对着彼此咧嘴笑了），小鲁本醒来后，居然开始一字不差地重复那个古怪的老作家的长篇大论，那个萧伯纳(3)（“作品获准留给我们的不多的作家之一”），他当时正在讲述自己的天赋，这个讲自己天赋的传统经考证确实曾经存在。小鲁本自然是一点都听不懂这个讲座，他一边背诵还一边挤眉弄眼，嘻嘻傻笑，他的父母以为这个孩子突然发了疯，赶紧请了医生。幸运的是，这个医生懂英语，他听出这是前一天晚上萧伯纳的广播讲座，并意识到了这件事的重要意义，于是马上给医学杂志写了一封信。

“在睡眠中进行教育的原则，或曰，睡眠教育法，就这样被发现了。”中心主任意味深长地停顿了一下。

原则被发现了，但是，好多年过去之后，这个原则才真正为人所用。

“小鲁本的这件事情发生在我们福帝的首辆T型车(4)推向市场后的第二十三年。”（说到这里，主任在肚子上划了个T字，所有的学生也都恭恭敬敬地照做。）“可是……”

学生们拼命地记着笔记。“睡眠教育法，福特纪元214年首次正式使用。为什么之前没有运用呢？两个原因。一……”

“那些早期的实验者，”中心主任继续讲着，“走错了路子。他们以为睡眠教育可以用作知识教育的手段……”

（一个小男孩向右侧卧着在睡觉，右胳膊伸着，右手软软地垂在床沿上。透过一个匣子侧面的圆格栅，一个声音轻柔地讲述着。

“尼罗河是非洲第一长河，全球第二长河。虽然其长度仅次于密西西比-密苏里河，但从流域的跨度来看，尼罗河居于所有河流之首，其流域跨越了35个纬度……”

第二天早餐时，有个人问：“汤米，你知道非洲第一长河是哪条河吗？”摇摇头。“你难道不记得那句话了吗？尼罗河是……”

“尼罗河是非洲第一长河，全球第二长河。”这些话脱口而出，“虽然其长度仅次于……”

“那么，非洲哪条河最长呢？”

眼神空洞。“我不知道。”

“尼罗河呀，汤米。”

“尼罗河是非洲第一长河，全球第二……”

“那么，汤米，哪条河最长呢？”

汤米哇哇大哭起来。“我不知道。”他呜呜哭着说。）

这种嚎啕大哭，主任说得很明白，令最早期的实验者们非常气馁。实验被放弃了。再没有人尝试在孩子们睡觉时教他们诸如尼罗河的长度之类的知识。放弃实验是非常明智的。你不懂科学是什么的时候根本学不了科学。

“哎呀，如果他们当时开始道德教育就好了。”主任说，领着他们走向房门。学生们在后面跟着，一边走一边使劲记着，在电梯里也一路记着。“道德教育，在任何情况下，都永远不应该诉诸理智啊。”

“肃静，肃静。”他们刚刚踏出电梯，上到十四楼，就听见扩音器在低声叮咛着。“肃静，肃静。”每隔一会儿，沿每条走廊安放的喇叭口就不知疲倦地重复一遍。学生们，甚至主任自己，都不自觉地踮起了脚尖。当然，他们都是阿尔法，但即使是阿尔法们，也是受过良好训练的。“肃静，肃静。”整个十四层的空气中都回响着这个命令。

他们踮着脚尖走了五十码，来到一道门前，主任谨慎地推开门。他们跨过门槛，进入一个昏暗的宿舍，百叶窗全拉得严严实实的。八十张婴儿床靠墙摆成一排。人们能够听到轻微而均匀的呼吸声和不间断的喃喃声，好像从远处传来的窃窃私语。

看到他们走进来，一个护士站了起来，在主任面前立正站好。

“今天下午是什么课？”他问道。

“前四十分钟我们学习了基础性知识，”她回答，“现在，已经调到基础阶级意识了。”

主任沿着那排婴儿床缓缓地往前走。八十个小男孩和小女孩躺在那儿，平静地呼吸着，他们睡着了的小脸蛋非常放松，两颊红扑扑的。从每个枕头下面都传出轻柔的声音。中心主任停下来，弯下腰，凝神听着。

“你刚才说的是基础阶级意识吗？把喇叭声音稍微调大些吧。”

房间尽头，一个扩音器从墙上伸出来。主任走过去，按下一个开关。

“……都穿绿色，”一个轻柔但清晰的声音说，正说到一句话的中间，“德尔塔孩子们穿卡其色。哦，我才不愿意和德尔塔孩子们玩呢。艾普西隆就更糟了，他们太笨了，既不会读，也不会写，况且，他们还穿黑色，那么糟糕的颜色。我是贝塔，我太高兴了。”

短暂的停顿后，这个声音又开始了。

“阿尔法孩子们穿灰色。他们比我们工作努力得多，因为他们聪明得吓人。我是贝塔，我真是太高兴了，因为我不用那么努力地工作。并且，我们比伽马和德尔塔们强多了。伽马们很笨，他们都穿绿色，德尔塔孩子们穿卡其色。哦，我才不愿意和德尔塔孩子们玩呢。艾普西隆就更糟了，他们太笨了，既不会……”

主任把开关按回原位。声音消失了，只有细细的余音还继续在八十个枕头下面萦绕着。

“在孩子们醒来前，这些内容还会重复四十或五十遍，然后星期四一次，星期六还有一次。每次重复一百二十遍，每周三次，持续三十个月，之后，他们会升入更高级的课程。”

玫瑰花和电击，德尔塔们的卡其色和一丝阿魏树脂的气味，在孩子们还不会说话时，这之间的联系就已经密不可分了。但是，这种无言的条件训练是非常粗略的，而且是大批量进行的，并不能让孩子们真正掌握更细微的差别，也不能教会他们更复杂的行为。为此，必须要使用话语，毫无理由地使用话语。简而言之，实施睡眠教育法。

“有史以来，这是进行道德教育和社会教育的最伟大的力量。”

学生们在小笔记本上记下来了。直接受教于权威人士嘛。

主任又按了一下开关。

“……聪明得吓人，”轻柔的声音正在说着，充满暗示，丝毫不知疲倦，“我是贝塔，我真是太高兴了，因为……”

这些话语，与其说像水滴，水滴确实也能在最坚硬的大理石上磨出洞来，倒不如说更像一滴滴液态封蜡，能够粘上、包覆并融入它们滴落到的物质，直到岩石也变成猩红色的一团。

“到最后，孩子的头脑就是这些暗示，这些暗示就成了孩子的头脑。不仅仅是孩子的头脑，也是未来成年人的头脑，并且终其一生。能够判断、产生欲望和做出决定的头脑，就是由这些暗示构成的。但是，所有这些暗示都是我们的暗示啊！”主任得意得几乎喊出来，“来自国家的暗示。”他敲打着离他最近的桌子，“因此呢……”

一个声音使他转过身来。

“哦，福帝！”他换了个声调，“我把孩子们给吵醒了。”

第三章


大楼外面，花园里，正是孩子们的玩耍时间。六七百个小男孩和小女孩，在六月温暖的阳光下，光着身子，尖叫着在草地上跑来跑去，或者在玩球，或者三三两两静静地蹲在花丛中。玫瑰花正在盛开，两只夜莺在灌木丛中自鸣自唱着，一只布谷鸟正在酸橙树上走调地唱着。空气中弥漫着蜜蜂和远处直升机发出的嗡嗡声，令人昏昏欲睡。

主任和学生们站了一小会儿，看他们玩“狗狗离心碰碰球”游戏。二十个孩子围成一圈，中间是一座镀铬钢架塔。一个球给抛上去，落到塔顶的平台上，滚入塔的内部，一直滚到一个快速旋转的盘子上，然后，从圆柱形的塔身上的无数小洞中的一个给甩出来，孩子们必须得抓住球才行。

他们走开时，主任自言自语般地说：“真奇怪，想想吧，即使在福帝那个年代，大多数游戏都不需要什么复杂的设施就能玩，至多需要一两个球和几根棍子，或许还有一块网子，这多奇怪呀。想想这有多么愚蠢吧，允许人们玩那么繁琐复杂的游戏，却根本增加不了消费。简直是发疯。现在，控制官不会批准任何新的游戏了，除非能够证明，游戏至少需要使用和现存最复杂的游戏差不多的设施。”他说着又岔开了话题。

“那两个孩子可真讨人喜欢。”他说，指点着。

在两丛高大的地中海石楠之间，两个孩子，一个七岁左右的小男孩和一个大概比他大一岁的女孩正在玩最初级的性游戏，他俩表情严肃，聚精会神，好像科学家正在专注地进行某项科学研究似的。

“讨人喜欢，真讨人喜欢！”中心主任动情地重复了一遍。

“讨人喜欢。”男孩子们礼貌地应和着。但是，他们的微笑颇有些居高临下的意味。他们自己不久前刚刚放弃了这类幼稚的游戏，所以，当看到别的孩子在玩，他们不可能不带几分鄙夷。有什么讨人喜欢的？只不过是两个孩子在闹着玩，仅此而已，就是小儿科罢了。

“我总是想啊……”主任的话里还带着刚才的那种感伤语气，突然，一阵嘈杂的哭闹声打断了他的思路。

一个护士从附近的灌木丛里走出来，拉着一个小男孩的手，小男孩边走边哇哇大哭。一个神色焦急的小女孩一路小跑着跟在护士后面。

“怎么回事？”主任问。

护士耸了耸肩膀。“也没什么大不了的，”她回答，“就是这个小男孩好像不太愿意加入那种常规的性游戏。我以前就注意到了一两次。今天又发现了。他刚才还开始哭叫了……”

“说实话，”一脸焦急的小女孩说，“我并没有想伤害他或怎么样，真的。”

“你当然不会伤害他了，亲爱的。”护士安慰她。“那么，”她转向主任，接着说，“我现在带他去看看心理总监助理，看看是不是哪里不太正常。”

“你做得很对，”主任说，“快带他去吧。小姑娘，你留下。”他等护士带着仍然在哭闹的男孩儿走了之后，对小女孩说，“你叫什么名字啊？”

“波莉·托洛茨基。”

“名字也挺好听。”主任说，“赶快过去吧，看看能不能另外找个小男孩一块玩儿。”

小女孩一下子就跑进灌木丛，没影儿了。

“可爱的小家伙！”主任看着她的背影说。然后，他转向学生们。“我现在要跟你们讲的，”他说，“可能听起来匪夷所思。但是，当你们不熟悉历史的时候，过去的大多事实确实令人难以置信。”

他讲出了令人震惊的真相。在福帝诞生之前很久的时候，甚至在福帝诞生之后的很多年里，人们认为孩子们之间的性游戏是不正常的（爆发出一阵哄堂大笑），不仅不正常，而且是不道德的（不会吧！），因此，要受到严厉的压制。

他的听众们脸上现出既震惊又觉得不可思议的表情。居然都不让可怜的小孩们自娱自乐？他们简直不能相信。

“即使是青少年，”主任还在说着，“即使是跟你们一般大的青少年……”

“不可能吧！”

“除了一丁点偷偷摸摸的自慰行为和同性间的娱乐，其他什么都没有。”

“什么都没有？”

“在大多数情况下，是的，直到他们二十岁之后。”

“二十岁？”学生们异口同声地大声问道，一脸质疑。

“二十岁。”主任重复了一遍，“我都告诉你们了嘛，你们一定会觉得难以置信的。”

“那以后发生了什么事？”他们问，“这么做的结果是什么？”

“结果很糟糕。”一个低沉响亮的声音突然插入了他们的对话。

他们扭头去看。在他们这一小群人的旁边站着一个不认识的人，他中等个子，一头黑发，长着鹰钩鼻、饱满红润的嘴唇和锐利深邃的眼睛。“很糟糕。”他又说了一遍。

中心主任这时已经坐到了一个钢架橡胶凳子上，这些凳子就散放在花园各处，非常方便。主任一看到这个陌生人，马上跳了起来，疾步上前，两只手向前伸着，整张脸都堆满了笑容，露出满口牙齿。

“控制官！真令人惊喜呀！孩子们，你们还在想什么呢？这是控制官啊，穆斯塔法·蒙德福下(1)。”




中心的四千个房间里，四千座电子钟同时敲响了四点钟。喇叭口里传出了合成的声音：

“主白班下班，第二班换班。主白班下班……”

在人们上楼去更衣室的电梯上，亨利·福斯特和命运预定中心的主任助理转过身去，非常不客气地背对着心理局的伯纳德·马克斯——避开那个名声不佳的人。

胚胎库里，机器轻弱的嗡嗡声和咔嗒声依然搅动着那里暗红色的空气。换班的人也许会来来去去，一张犹如患红斑狼疮的脸也许会替代另一张，但是，传送带依然将庄严地缓慢前行，满载着未来的男男女女。

列宁娜·克朗步履轻快地走向房门。




是穆斯塔法·蒙德福下！学生们敬着礼，眼睛几乎都从脑袋上蹦出来了。穆斯塔法·蒙德！西欧的常驻控制官！十个世界控制官之一，十个之一……他和中心主任一起坐在凳子上，他要停留一会儿，停留一会儿，是的，他居然开始跟他们讲话……直接来自大人物之口啊，直接来自福下之口啊。

两个皮肤晒成红棕色的孩子从附近的一个灌木丛中钻出来，张着大大的眼睛，吃惊地盯了他们一会儿，之后又回到树叶中间，继续他们的游戏。

“你们都记得，”控制官以他低沉有力的嗓音说，“你们都记得吧，我们福帝那句金玉良言：历史就是废话。历史，”他缓缓地重复了一遍，“就是废话。”

他挥了挥手，好像在用一把看不见的羽毛掸子轻轻地拂去几粒灰尘，而那些灰尘就是哈拉巴(2)，是迦勒底的乌尔城(3)；又像轻轻掸掉了几丝蜘蛛网，它们就是底比斯、巴比伦、卡诺索斯和迈锡尼(4)。拂啊，掸啊，哪里还有奥德修斯(5)？约伯(6)又在哪里？朱庇特(7)、乔达摩(8)和耶稣呢？拂啊，掸啊，那些叫作雅典和罗马、叫作耶路撒冷和中央帝国的星星点点的古代微尘都消散了；拂啊，掸啊，曾经叫意大利的那个地方变得空旷；拂啊，掸啊，大教堂消失了；拂啊，掸啊，李尔王和帕斯卡(9)的思想消失了；拂啊，掸啊，激情没有了；拂啊，掸啊，安魂曲没有了；拂啊，掸啊，交响乐没有了；拂啊，掸啊……




“亨利，晚上去看感官电影吗？”命运预定中心的主任助理问道，“我听说阿罕布拉(10)那里放的新电影超级棒。有一场在熊皮地毯上的性爱戏，据说非常美妙。熊身上的每根毛发都栩栩如生。最惊人的技术效果。”




“这就是没有教你们历史的原因，”控制官在说，“但现在，是时候了……”

孵化与条件训练中心主任紧张地看着控制官。有一些奇怪的流言蜚语，说控制官书房的保险柜里藏着古代的禁书。圣经啊，诗歌啊，都有些什么，福帝才晓得。

穆斯塔法·蒙德注意到了主任忧虑的眼神，他红润的唇角略带嘲讽地轻轻上扬。

“别担心，主任，”他语含讥讽地说，“我不会教坏他们的。”

中心主任顿时慌乱得不知所措。




那些觉得自己被鄙视的人通常都会做出一副鄙视他人的姿态。伯纳德·马克斯脸上的微笑就颇有几分轻蔑。熊身上的每根毛发，真是的！

“我会专门记着去看看的。”亨利·福斯特说。




穆斯塔法·蒙德身子前倾，向他们摇着一根手指。“试着想象一下，”他说，他的声音径直穿透他们的横膈膜，让他们产生一阵奇怪的震颤，“试着想象，如果有一个怀胎生了你们的母亲，那会是什么样的情景。”

又是那个脏词，但是，这一次，他们连做梦都想不到要笑了。

“试着想象‘和自己的家庭生活在一起’是什么样。”

他们努力试着，但是，很明显，没有丝毫的成功。

“你们知道什么是‘家庭’吗？”

他们摇摇头。

*

列宁娜从她暗红色的房间里走出来，乘上电梯，很快上升了十七层，她出电梯向右拐，沿着一条长长的走廊走过去，打开一扇写着“女更衣室”的门。她一下子就步入了一个喧闹的世界，乱糟糟的，满眼望去，全都是胳膊、胸脯和内衣裤。热水哗哗地溅入成百个浴盆，又汩汩地流淌而出。八十台振动真空按摩机同时在工作，隆隆隆，嘶嘶嘶，在八十个堪称完美的女性身体上揉捏着，吮吸着，这些肉体都非常结实，给太阳晒成了棕色。每个人都在尖着嗓子大声说话。合成音乐机里正在悠扬地播放着一支超级短号独奏曲。

“嗨，范妮。”列宁娜对旁边的那个年轻女孩说，她们两个人的挂衣架和储物柜紧挨着。

范妮在装瓶室工作，她也姓克朗。但是，考虑到全球二十亿个居民一共只有一万个姓氏，那么这个巧合其实也没有什么好惊喜的。

列宁娜唰地拉开上衣的拉链，双手并用地拉下了长裤的两条拉链，又一直向下松开了内衣裤。她还穿着鞋子和袜子，就径直走向洗浴间。




家，家——几个小房间，里面挤着一个男人，一个定期怀上孩子的女人，和一群吵吵闹闹、大大小小的男孩女孩，压抑得让人透不过气来。没有空气，没有空间，简直就是一个消毒不彻底的监狱，充斥着黑暗、疾病和臭味。

（控制官的讲述太生动了，在听到这番描述之后，一个比较敏感的男孩子的脸顿时变得煞白，几乎要呕吐了。）




列宁娜走出洗浴间，用毛巾擦干身体，抓住嵌进墙壁的一根长长的软管，把管口对准胸脯，好像要自杀的样子，摁下了开关。一阵热风喷涌而出，在她身上撒上了一层细细的爽身粉。洗脸池上方有八个龙头，提供八种不同气味的香水和古龙水，她拧开从左数的第三个，在身上涂抹了一点西普香水(11)。然后，她拎着鞋子和袜子走出去，想看看有没有振动真空按摩机闲着。




家是肮脏的，这种肮脏不仅指外部，还包括心理层面。从心理上说，家就是一个兔子窝，一个大垃圾堆，因为拥挤，人们的身体互相摩擦碰撞，加上总是涌动着情感，这个家变得热烘烘的。多么令人窒息的亲密！家庭成员之间的关系是多么危险、疯狂而淫秽！妈妈发疯般地看护着自己的孩子们（她的孩子）……就像老猫看护着幼崽儿，但这是一只会说话的猫，会说“我的宝贝，我的宝贝”的猫，她一次又一次地说：“我的宝贝，哦，在我的胸前，这些小手儿，看他饿成什么了，这难以言传的感觉，痛苦中的快乐！终于，我的宝贝睡着了，我的宝贝睡着了，嘴角还沾着一滴白色的奶汁。我的小宝贝睡……”

“是的，”穆斯塔法点点头，“真够让你们恶心得打个激灵的。”




“你今天晚上和谁一起出去呀？”列宁娜问，她刚刚做了真空按摩出来，皮肤泛着粉红色，就像一颗从内部被照亮的珍珠一样。

“不和谁出去了。”

列宁娜的眉毛吃惊地挑了起来。

“我最近身体感到不太自在。”范妮解释道，“威尔斯医生建议我服用一些代孕片呢。”

“可是，亲爱的，你才十九啊。代孕片最早也要等到二十一岁才是必须服用的呢。”

“我知道，亲爱的，但有些人早点服用更好。威尔斯医生告诉我，像我这样，骨盆宽大、棕色头发的人，应该到十七岁就第一次服用代孕片。所以，我已经晚了两年，而不是早了两年。”她打开储物柜的门，指了指上层隔板上的一排盒子和贴着标签的药瓶。

“黄体素糖浆，”列宁娜大声念着那些药名，“卵巢素，保证新鲜：福特纪元632年8月1日到期；乳腺提取液：每天三次，饭前服用，以水冲服；胎盘素：每三天注射五毫升……哦！”列宁娜打了个哆嗦，“我多么讨厌静脉注射啊！你呢？”

“我一样。但是，它们对我们有好处……”范妮这个姑娘特别明事理。




我们的福帝，或者说，我们的弗洛伊德，因为，每当他说起心理学方面的事情时，出于某种不可知的原因，他总是会这么称呼他自己。我们的弗洛伊德是第一个揭露家庭生活可怕危险的人。这个世界上充斥着父亲，因此才有那么多苦难；充斥着母亲，因此才会有施虐狂和贞操狂等种种变态行为；充斥着兄弟姐妹、叔伯姑姨，因此才会有疯狂和自杀。

“但是，在萨摩亚的野蛮人中间，在新几内亚海岸外的个别岛屿上……”

热带的阳光如同温暖的蜂蜜，沾在孩子们赤裸的身体上，他们在木槿花丛里打着滚，玩闹着。他们的家就是棕榈树叶覆盖的那二十座房子中的一座。在特罗布里恩岛上，怀孕就好像是古代鬼魂们所做的事情；没有人听说过父亲。

“这两种极端情况同时存在，”控制官说，“极端情况同时存在也是应该的。”

*

“威尔斯医生说服用三个月的代孕片对我以后三四年的健康有好处。”

“嗯，希望他是对的吧。”列宁娜说，“可是，范妮，你真的是说，在以后的三个月里，你都不能……”

“不是的，亲爱的，只要一两个星期，就这样的。我晚上会待在俱乐部里，玩玩音乐桥牌。你要出去吧？”

列宁娜点点头。

“和谁呀？”

“亨利·福斯特。”

“还和他？”范妮满月形的脸上流露出既痛苦又吃惊的表情，似乎有点不满，这表情与她的善良显得颇有些不协调，“你的意思是说，你还在和亨利·福斯特交往吗？”




爸爸和妈妈，兄弟和姐妹。而且，还有丈夫、妻子、情人。还有一夫一妻制，有浪漫爱情。

“不过，你们很可能不知道那些都是什么意思吧？”穆斯塔法·蒙德说。

他们摇摇头。

家庭，一夫一妻制，浪漫爱情。每一个都具有排外性，都要集中注意力，都将本能与精力禁锢到一个狭窄的渠道内。

“可是，人人彼此相属。”他总结道，引用了睡眠教育中的谚语。

学生们用力点点头，他们对这个说法再同意不过了，因为，他们都曾经在黑暗中听到这句话重复过六万两千遍，不仅早就接受了它的真实性，而且认为这句话就像格言一样不言自明，丝毫不容置疑。




“毕竟，”列宁娜反驳道，“我跟亨利在一起才刚刚四个月。”

“刚刚四个月！我倒喜欢听你这么说。另外，”范妮接着说，伸出一个指头对着她，好像在指责她，“这四个月里，除了亨利，你就没有跟过其他人吗？有没有？”

列宁娜的脸涨得通红，但她的眼睛和说话的腔调依然咄咄逼人。“没有，没有别人。”她没好气地说，“我就不明白为什么非得还要跟别人。”

“哦，她就是不明白为什么非得还要跟别人。”范妮重复了一遍，好像在对列宁娜左后方一个看不见的听众说话，然后，她突然变了语气，“说真的，我真的认为你应该谨慎点。总跟一个人在一起太不像话了。如果你四十岁了，或者三十五了，都没有那么糟糕。可是你这样的年纪，列宁娜呀，不行的，真的不行。你也知道，孵化与条件训练中心主任是多么反对任何强烈的或长时间的感情纠葛的。四个月，只跟亨利·福斯特一个人，中间没有任何别的男人，天哪，如果他知道了，非气疯了不可……”




“想想水管里受压之后的水吧。”他们开始考虑。“我以前扎破过水管，”控制官说，“那喷出来的水柱！”

他扎了二十次，二十个小小的喷泉喷涌而出。

“我的宝贝，我的宝贝！”

“妈妈！”疯狂会传染。

“我的爱，我的唯一，可爱的，可爱的……”

妈妈，一夫一妻制，爱情。喷泉喷出高高的水柱，猛烈的、泛着水沫的水柱。这股冲动只有一个出口。我的爱，我的宝贝。难怪那些前现代时期的人都那么疯狂、邪恶、可怜。是他们的世界不让他们随遇而安，不让他们拥有理智、高尚和幸福。正是因为有了妈妈们和情人们，有了各种禁忌，而他们没有受过条件训练去遵从这些禁忌，正是因为有了那些诱惑、孤单的悔恨，有了所有那些疾病和无穷无尽的孤独的痛苦，有了不安和贫困，他们才被迫产生了强烈的情感。而一旦有了强烈的情感（况且是孤独时的强烈情感，在无助的孤立中的强烈情感），他们怎么可能会稳定呢？




“你当然没有必要放弃他。隔三岔五地也跟跟别人吧，这就够了。他应该有别的女孩吧？”

列宁娜承认了这一点。

“他当然会有了。相信我，亨利·福斯特可是正人君子啊，总是做正确的事。再说，你也得考虑考虑主任那里。你知道，他是很坚持传统的。”

列宁娜点点头。“今天下午他还拍了我的屁股。”她说。

“就是嘛，你看！”范妮很得意，“这就表明了他持什么观点，最严格的传统啊。”




“稳定，”控制官说，“稳定。没有社会稳定就不会有文明。没有个人的稳定就不会有社会的稳定。”他的声音就像喇叭声。听着他的话，学生们感觉自己变大、变温暖了。

机器在转动，转动，必须不断地转动，无休无止。如果停止了，死亡就来临了。十亿人曾经在地球表面上乱蹬乱跑。轮子开始了转动。在一百五十年里，就有了二十亿人。停下所有的轮子，只消一百五十个星期，就会只剩下十亿人，其余的那十亿个男男女女都饿死了。

轮子必须持续转动，但是必须得有人看管。必须有人照看，和轴上的轮子一样稳定的人，理智的人，顺服的人，满足于稳定的人。

哭喊：我的宝贝，我的妈妈，我的唯一，我的爱。呻吟：我的罪孽，我可怕的上帝。痛苦的哭喊，发烧般的胡言乱语，哀叹年老和贫困——这样的人怎么能够照看轮子啊？如果他们照看不了轮子……那么，十亿个男男女女的尸体可不是那么好掩埋的，也不是那么好焚化的。




“毕竟，”范妮的语气像在哄她，“又不是什么痛苦或者难过的事情，就是让你在亨利之外再多一两个男人。现在既然明白了，你应该再稍微随便一点……”




“稳定，”控制官强调，“稳定，是最基本的也是最终的目的。稳定。因此才有了现在的这一切。”

他一挥手，指了指花园、训练中心的大楼、躲在灌木丛里玩乐或者在草地上跑来跑去的裸体孩子们。




列宁娜摇摇头，沉思着说：“不知道怎么回事，我最近不太想那么随便了。人有时候就是这样。范妮，你有没有过这种感觉？”

范妮点点头，表示理解和同情。“但是，你得努力调整啊，”她简洁地说，“总得要按游戏规则来。毕竟，人人彼此相属嘛。”

“是的，人人彼此相属。”列宁娜缓缓地说，又叹了口气，沉默了一会儿。然后，她抓住范妮的手，轻轻捏了一下。“你说得非常对，范妮，跟以往一样对。我会努力的。”




受到阻碍的本能流溢出来，形成情感的洪水，激情的洪水，甚至疯狂的洪水。洪水的强度取决于水流的力量以及障碍物的高度和强度。未受阻滞的水流则沿着指定的河道平稳流淌，流入平静的幸福港湾。胚胎饿了，日复一日，代血浆泵不间断地转动着，每分钟八百转。换瓶后的婴儿哭了，马上有护士拿着一瓶外分泌液来了。在欲望与欲望得到满足之间的间隙里，情感就会悄然产生。尽量缩短这一间隙，打破所有那些古老的、不必要的障碍。

“幸运的孩子们！”控制官说，“为了让你们的生活不受情感的烦扰，真可谓不惜代价，就是为了让你们，尽可能地让你们不要产生任何情感。”

“福帝在车里，”中心主任念念有词，“天下享太平。”




“列宁娜·克朗？”亨利·福斯特说，一边拉上长裤的拉链，一边回答着命运预定中心主任助理的问话，“哦，她是个超级棒的姑娘。丰满美妙的胸部。你还没有和她一起睡过，我太吃惊了。”

“我也想不出为什么到现在还没有。”命运预定中心主任助理说，“我一定会的，一有机会就和她睡。”

伯纳德·马克斯在更衣室过道的另一侧，无意中听到了这两个人的交谈，他脸都白了。




“说实话吧，”列宁娜说，“我开始有点厌倦天天跟亨利一个人了。”她穿上左脚的袜子，“你认识伯纳德·马克斯吗？”她问话的语气过于随意，一听就知道是刻意装出来的。

范妮看起来吃了一惊。“你不会是说……”

“为什么不呢？伯纳德是阿尔法＋呢。况且，他还曾经邀请我和他一起去一个野蛮人保留地呢。我一直想去野蛮人保留地看看呢。”

“可是，他的名声？”

“我干吗要在意他的名声呢？”

“我听人说，他不喜欢玩障碍高尔夫。”

“听人说，听人说。”列宁娜嘲弄地说。

“并且，他大多数时间都是一个人待着，独自一人。”范妮的声音里有一丝恐惧。

“他跟我在一起就不是独自一人了。为什么人们对他这么刻薄呢？我觉得他挺可爱的。”她自个儿笑了。他当时害羞得简直有点荒唐啊！几乎都吓坏了，好像她是世界控制官，而他自己只不过是个看机器的伽马－一样。




“想想你们自己的生活，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“你们之中有谁遇到过难以克服的障碍吗？”

对这个问题的回答是一阵表示否定的沉默。

“你们之中有谁有过某种欲望，忍了很长时间这种欲望才终于得到了满足？”

“嗯。”一个男孩开了口，又犹豫了。

“大声说，”中心主任说，“不要让福下久等。”

“有一次，我等了几乎四个星期，我想得到的一个女孩才同意和我在一起。”

“你是否因此体验到了强烈的情感？”

“简直可怕！”

“可怕，说得太对了。”控制官说，“我们的祖先们太愚蠢，太短视了，当最初的改革家们提出要把他们从可怕的情感中解脱出来时，他们还不愿意呢。”




“那样谈论她，好像她就是一块肉似的。”伯纳德咬了咬牙，“在这里占有她，在那里占有她。就像一块羊肉，把她降格为羊肉。她说她会考虑的，她说本周就会给我答复。哦，福帝，福帝，福帝啊。”他真想走上前去，狠狠地揍他们两个的脸，一拳接一拳地打。

“是啊，我真建议你试试她。”亨利·福斯特正在说。

*

“以体外人工培育为例吧，普菲茨纳和川口早就研究出了整套技术，可是政府愿意看一眼吗？不。有一种叫作基督教的东西。妇女们被迫继续怀胎生育。”




“他太丑了！”范妮说。

“我倒挺喜欢他的长相。”

“还太矮小。”范妮做了个鬼脸。长得矮小太可怕了，低级的种姓才会矮小呢。

“我觉得那样很可爱，”列宁娜说，“他让人有种想爱抚他的感觉。你知道，就像对一只猫那样。”

范妮很震惊。“听人说，他还在瓶子里的时候，有人出了个错，以为他是伽马，把酒精倒进了他的代血浆，所以他才那么矮呢。”

“一派胡言！”列宁娜愤愤不平。




“在英国，睡眠教育曾经被禁止。有一种叫作自由主义的东西呀。议会，不知道你们对这个了解不了解，通过了法律，禁止睡眠教育。那些记录还保存着呢。关于臣民之自由的演讲。简直就是无能和可怜的自由，是不合时宜的自由。”




“老兄，不用客气，我向你保证，不用客气。”亨利·福斯特拍拍命运预定中心主任助理的肩膀，“毕竟，人人彼此相属嘛。”




每晚一百遍的重复，每星期三个晚上，连续四年，伯纳德·马克斯想着，他可是一位睡眠教育专家。六万两千四百遍的重复后，这句话就成了真理。真是白痴！




“或者以种姓制度为例吧，有人不断地提出建议，却一次又一次地被拒绝，就因为有一种叫作民主的东西。好像人们除了生理和化学方面的平等外，还有别的什么方面也平等似的。”




“好吧，我得说，我打算接受他的邀请。”




伯纳德恨他们，恨他们。可是，他们是两个人，而且个子高大，非常强壮。




“九年战争开始于福特纪元141年。”




“即便关于他的代血浆里添加了酒精的说法是真的，你也不会还要接受吧。”




“氯氧化碳、三氯硝基甲烷、碘乙酸乙酯、二苯代胂氰、三氯甲基、氯甲酸酯、硫代氯乙烷都用上了，更不用说氢氰酸了。”




“不过，我不相信那是真的。”列宁娜最后说。




“一万四千架飞机轰鸣着列队飞行。但在柏林库达姆大街和巴黎第八区，炭疽炸弹爆炸并不比拍破一个纸袋子声音大多少。”




“因为我真的想去看看野蛮人保留地。”




“CH3C6H2(NO2)3+Hg(CNO)2=什么呢？等于地上的一个大窟窿，一堆碎砖瓦砾，几片残存的肉和黏膜，一只脚，还穿着靴子呢，从空中飞过，啪嗒，落入天竺葵丛，那种猩红色的。那年夏天的表演多么耀眼！”

*

“你真是无可救药了，列宁娜，我不管你了。”




“俄国将水资源感染病毒的技术真是太巧妙了。”




范妮和列宁娜两人背对着背，沉默着换完了衣服。




“九年战争，经济上的大崩溃。必须做出选择，要么是世界性的控制，要么是世界性的毁灭；要么是稳定，要么是……”




“范妮·克朗也是个不错的姑娘。”命运预定中心主任助理说。




在育婴房里，基础阶级意识课已经结束，那些轻柔的声音现在要让未来的需求跟上未来的工业品供应。“我真喜欢坐飞机，”声音窃窃私语，“我真喜欢坐飞机，我真喜欢买新衣服，我真喜欢……”




“很自然地，在炭疽炸弹爆炸之中，自由主义灭亡了，但是，人们还是不能靠武力做事情。”




“就是胸部远不如列宁娜那么丰满，哦，真是远不如。”




“旧衣服真丑陋，”不知疲倦的细语，“我们总是扔掉旧衣服。扔掉好过修补，扔掉好过修补，扔掉好过……”




“政府的职责是坐着管理，而不是去打人。应该用脑子和屁股来管理，而不是用拳头。比如，逼人消费这回事。”

*

“好了，我准备好了。”列宁娜说，但是，范妮还是一言不发，别着个脸。“咱俩和好吧，亲爱的范妮。”




“每一个人，男人、女人和孩子一年内都被迫消费一定的数量。这是为了工业发展的缘故。唯一的结果就是……”




“扔掉好过修补。补丁越多，人越穷；补丁越多……”




“总有一天，”范妮说，难过地强调，“你会惹上麻烦的。”




“出现了大规模的反对，非常严肃认真的反对。不要消费任何东西，要回归自然。”




“我真喜欢坐飞机。我真喜欢坐飞机。”




“回归文化，是的，实际上是回归文化。如果你总是静静地坐着读书，你不会消费很多东西的。”




“我看起来还可以吗？”列宁娜问。她穿的是那种玻璃瓶绿色的人造丝上衣，袖口和领口镶着绿色的黏胶纤维毛条。




“在伦敦戈尔德斯格林，八百个简单生活派成员被机枪扫平了。”




“扔掉好过修补。扔掉好过修补。”




下身穿绿色的灯芯绒短裤，白色的黏胶毛长袜子，袜口在膝盖下面翻卷过来。




*

“之后，就是著名的大英博物馆屠杀。两千个文化粉丝被硫化二氯甲基气体毒死。”




一顶绿白相间的骑手帽遮住了列宁娜的眼睛；她的鞋子是翠绿色的，擦得锃亮。




“最终，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“控制官们意识到，动用武力是没什么用处的。然后，开始采用缓慢但却绝对可靠的技术——体外人工培育、新巴甫洛夫条件训练法、睡眠教育法……”




她的腰上系了一条镶着银边的绿色代摩洛哥皮的腰带，因为常规供给的避孕药放在里面，皮带稍稍有点隆起（列宁娜不是不孕女）。




“普菲茨纳和川口的发现终于得到了运用。一场大规模的反对怀胎生育的宣传运动……”




“太完美了！”范妮兴奋地喊道，她总是难以长时间抵挡列宁娜的魅力，“这条马尔萨斯腰带(12)好漂亮啊！”




“同进还有反对过去的运动，博物馆被关闭，历史纪念物被炸掉（幸运的是，大多数都已经在九年战争中被毁掉了），所有福特纪元150年之前出版的书籍被禁。”

*

“我一定要买一条。”范妮说。




“比如，有一种叫作金字塔的东西。”




“我的那条黑漆皮的旧腰带……”




“还有一个叫作莎士比亚的人。你们肯定从来没有听说过吧。”




“简直太丢人了，我的那条腰带。”




“这就是真正科学教育的优势啊。”




“补丁越多，人越穷；补丁越多，人越……”




“福帝第一辆T型车的推出……”




“我都用了快三个月了。”




“被定为新时代的起点。”




“扔掉好过修补；扔掉好过……”




“我刚说过，有一种叫作基督教的东西。”




“扔掉好过修补。”




“节俭消费的伦理和哲学……”




“我喜欢新衣服，我喜欢新衣服，我喜欢……”




“在生产不足的情况下，是非常必要的；但是，在这个机器和固氮合成氨的时代，节俭消费简直就是对社会的犯罪啊。”




“亨利·福斯特送给我的。”




“所有的十字架都给去掉了上边的那部分，成了T字。那时候也有一种叫作上帝的东西。”




“是真正的代摩洛哥皮革。”




“我们现在有了世界国，有福帝日庆祝活动，有社区歌曲演唱，有团结祈祷仪式。”




“福帝呀，我恨死他们了！”伯纳德·马克斯心想。




“有一种东西叫作天堂，但是，他们还是经常喝酒喝得烂醉如泥。”




“就像肉一样，就像一块肉一样。”




“有一种叫作灵魂的东西，一种叫作永生的东西。”




“一定要问问亨利他是从哪里买到的。”

*

“但他们还是服用吗啡和可卡因。”




“更糟糕的是，她自己也觉得自己就是块肉。”




“福特纪元178年，两千个药剂师和生化专家得到资助。”




“他看起来闷闷不乐的。”命运预定中心主任助理指着伯纳德·马克斯说。




“六年后，药片就投产并进入市场了，那种完美的药片。”




“咱俩逗逗他。”




“令人迷醉，让人感觉美妙，飘飘欲仙一般美妙。”




“你愁眉苦脸，马克斯，愁眉苦脸啊。”肩膀上的这一下子让他吓了一跳，他抬起头一看，是那个讨厌的亨利·福斯特，“你需要一克唆麻。”




“这药片兼有基督教和酒精的好处，却找不到一丝缺点。”




“福帝呀，我真想杀了他！”但他只是说了句：“不了，谢谢。”并用手挡住了对方递过来的那管药片。




“让你随时远离现实，给自己放个假，回来的时候头痛就没有了，胡思乱想也没有了。”

*

“吃一片吧，”亨利·福斯特坚持着，“吃了吧。”




“稳定几乎完全得以保障。”




“吃下一小片，烦恼都不见。”命运预定中心主任助理说，引用了一条睡眠中记住的真理。




“要做的就剩下征服老年了。”




“讨厌，讨厌！”伯纳德·马克斯喊。




“哎哟喂，别那么高傲嘛。”




“性腺荷尔蒙，输年轻人的血液，镁盐……”




“记住，唆麻一片，摆脱苦难哦。”两个人走了出去，哈哈笑着。




“老年所有的生理衰退现象全都消除了，当然，伴随着的还有……”




“别忘了问他那条马尔萨斯腰带的事。”范妮说。




“老年人的精神特征也都消失了。终其一生，人的性格都不再变化。”

*

“……天黑之前还得玩两局障碍高尔夫，我得赶紧飞走了。”




“工作，玩乐——六十岁的时候，我们的体力和口味与十七岁时没有什么区别。在可怕的过去，老年人总是要放弃很多，退休，寄情于宗教，用读书和思考来消磨时间——哼，思考！”




“白痴，蠢猪！”伯纳德·马克斯自言自语，沿着过道走向电梯。




“现在，这才叫进步呢。老年人一样工作，一样性交，天天玩乐，没有时间，没有片刻工夫坐下来思考。或者，如果由于某种不幸的偶然情况，他们忙碌的娱乐消遣之中出现了空白时间，总是还有唆麻，美妙的唆麻。半克就换来半个假期，一克就等于过了个周末，两克就足够到秀丽的东方游历一番，三克则足以让他们到月球上昏沉沉地消磨一趟，回来的时候，他们会发现那段时间空白已经顺利越过，又回到了日常的工作和消遣，赶着看一场又一场的感官电影，和一个又一个胸部丰满的姑娘在一起，从一局电磁高尔夫到下一局……”




“走开，小姑娘，”中心主任生气地喊，“走开，小男孩！你们看不出福下在忙着吗？去，去别处玩你们的性游戏去。”




“可怜的孩子！”控制官说。




缓慢地，庄严地，伴随着机器发出的轻微嗡嗡声，传送带向前行进着，每小时三十三厘米。在暗红色的房间里，无数红宝石微微闪着光。

第四章


1


电梯里挤满了从阿尔法更衣室里走出来的人，列宁娜走进去后，许多人对她友好地点头微笑。她非常受欢迎，在过去的某个时候，她和他们中的几乎每个人都曾经共度良宵。

这些小伙子都那么可爱，她一边想，一边应答着他们的招呼。迷人的小伙子们！可是，她还是希望乔治·艾德兹尔的耳朵可以再小点（可能在三百二十八米的时候给他多注射了一点甲状腺素？）。看着本尼托·胡佛，她不禁想起，脱下衣服后他身上的体毛实在太多了。

回想起本尼托长满卷曲体毛的黑色身体，她的眼神里多了一丝伤感。她转过身去，发现了角落里伯纳德·马克斯瘦小的身躯和郁郁寡欢的脸。

“伯纳德！”她向前走了一步，“我正在找你呢。”她的声音在嗡嗡上升的电梯里显得格外清脆。其他人都好奇地扭脸看着她。“我想跟你谈谈我们去新墨西哥的计划。”透过眼睛的余光，她可以看到本尼托·胡佛吃惊地盯着这边。这让她很恼火。“他肯定很吃惊，我没有再次求着他，要跟他在一起！”她心里想。然后，她大声地、更加热情地说：“我很愿意跟你在七月份去一周。”（反正，她已经在公开证明对亨利的不忠了。尽管对象是伯纳德，范妮也该高兴了吧。）“当然，前提是，”她深情款款地展示出自己最迷人的微笑，“如果你还想跟我在一起的话。”

伯纳德苍白的脸涨得通红。“怎么会这样呢？”她很纳闷，也很吃惊，但是同时，她还是有点感动，他这种奇怪的表现恰恰证明了自己的魅力。

“咱们是不是在别处讨论这个问题更好？”他结结巴巴地说，看起来非常不自在。

“好像我在说什么大逆不道的话一样，”列宁娜心想，“如果我开个淫秽的玩笑，他也不会比现在更不安，比如说，问问他的妈妈是谁呀，或者那一类的话。”

“我是说，有这么多人在旁边……”他因为慌乱而顿住了。

列宁娜的笑声坦率而毫无恶意。“你可真有意思！”她说，她是真的认为他这个人有点好玩，“你会提前至少一周告诉我吧，是吧？”她换了一种口气说，“我想，我们是乘坐‘蓝色太平洋’号火箭吧？是从查令T字(1)塔起飞，还是从汉普斯特德站出发？”

伯纳德还没有来得及回答，电梯停了下来。

“到楼顶了！”一个沙哑的声音喊道。

电梯工是一个长得像猴子的小矮人，穿着艾普西隆－半白痴的那种黑色袍子。

“到楼顶了！”

他打开电梯门。温暖的午后阳光让他吓了一跳，他眨了眨眼睛。“哦，到楼顶了！”他又兴奋地喊道，好像从刚才那种吞没一切的黑暗和呆滞中突然清醒了过来，欢喜异常，“到楼顶了！”

他抬起头对着他的乘客们微笑着，执着地、期待地、心怀崇拜地微笑着。他们说着笑着，一起走出电梯，迈入阳光。电梯工盯着他们的背影。

“到楼顶了？”他又以询问的语气说了一遍。

然后，一声铃响，电梯顶部的一个扩音器以轻柔但不可抗拒的口吻发出了命令。

“下去，”这声音说，“下去，到十八楼。下去，下去，到十八楼。下去，下……”

电梯工关上门，按了个按钮，马上又回到了电梯井的昏暗和嗡嗡声之中，那种他所熟悉的昏暗和呆滞状态。

楼顶上非常温暖，阳光明亮。在这个夏日的午后，空中的直升机来来往往，嗡嗡作响，让人昏昏欲睡。火箭飞机在五六英里高处的蔚蓝天空中快速掠过，尽管看不见它们，但它们低沉的轰鸣声听起来就像在抚慰着柔和的空气。伯纳德·马克斯深深地吸了一口气，他抬头看看天空，扫了一眼蔚蓝的天际线，最后目光落在列宁娜的脸上。

“多美啊！”他的声音有一丝颤抖。

她对他微笑了一下，露出最体贴、最善解人意的表情。“玩障碍高尔夫再好不过了。”她狂喜地回答，“现在，我必须马上飞走了，伯纳德。如果让亨利久等，他该生气了。提前告诉我出发的日期。”她挥挥手，穿过宽阔平坦的楼顶，跑向飞机库。伯纳德站在那里看着，她白色袜子上的闪光越来越远，晒成棕色的膝盖活泼地弯曲，伸直，再弯曲，再伸直，在她玻璃瓶绿色的上衣下面，合体的灯芯绒短裤柔和地起伏着。他脸上现出痛苦的表情。

“我得说，她太漂亮了。”一个响亮愉快的声音从他背后传来。

伯纳德吓了一跳，扭脸去看。本尼托·胡佛红润的胖脸正望着他笑呢，带着一股明显的热诚劲儿。本尼托脾气好得很，大家都知道的。人们都说，他一生不碰唆麻都可以过得好好的。其他人需要靠吃唆麻、去度个假才能逃离的那些恶意和坏脾气什么的，从来不会烦扰他。对本尼托来说，现实总是那么阳光灿烂。

“胸部还那么丰满，那么丰满！”然后，他换了种口气，继续说，“我说，你看起来愁眉苦脸的！你需要一克唆麻。”本尼托把手伸进长裤右侧的口袋，掏出一个药瓶，“吃下一小片，烦恼都不……嗨！我说！”

伯纳德突然转身，匆匆走掉了。

本尼托盯着他的背影。“那个家伙是怎么回事啊？”他很纳闷，摇摇头，觉得有人把酒精倒入这个可怜人的代血浆的说法一定是真的，“影响了他的脑子，我想。”

他收起唆麻瓶子，拿出一包性荷尔蒙口香糖，往嘴里塞了一块，慢慢走向飞机库，边走边思考着。

亨利·福斯特已经让人把飞机从机库里推出来了，列宁娜赶到时，他已经坐在驾驶舱里等她了。

“晚了四分钟。”当她爬进去，坐在他旁边时，他只说了这一句。他发动了引擎，将直升机推进器推上挡。飞机垂直地蹿入云霄。亨利在加速，螺旋桨尖叫起来，轰鸣声由大变小，从大黄蜂的嗡嗡声变为小黄蜂的嗡嗡声，又变成蚊子的哼哼声。速度表显示，他们的速度已接近每分钟两千米。伦敦在他们下面渐渐变小了。几秒钟后，巨大的平顶楼房看起来不过是一片几何形地面上的一丛蘑菇，从绿色的公园和花园间冒出来。在这些蘑菇中间，有一朵细茎的、更高、更纤细的蘑菇，那就是查令T字塔，高耸入云，像是撑起了一个闪亮的水泥圆盘。

大团大团的蓬松白云从他们头顶上方的蓝天中飘过，像是神话中天神运动员们的模糊身躯。从这些云团中，突然坠下了一只小小的红色昆虫，一边降落，一边吱吱地叫着。

“那是‘红色火箭’号，”亨利说，“刚刚从纽约来的。”他看看表，“晚了七分钟。”他补了句，摇摇头，“这些大西洋航线，总是不够准时，真是够丢人的。”

他把脚从加速器上挪开，头顶上螺旋桨的轰鸣声陡降了八度半，又从小黄蜂变成大黄蜂，变成蜜蜂，金龟子，鹿角虫。飞机急速向上的势头慢下来，过了一会儿，他们便静止不动地悬在空中了。亨利推动了一根杠杆，听到咔嗒一声后，他们眼前的螺旋桨开始旋转，最初很慢，然后逐渐加速，越来越快，直到最后，螺旋桨在他们眼前转成了一片圆环状的迷雾。平行前进引起的风在拉杆间呼啸着。亨利的眼睛盯着转速表，当指针指向一千两百转时，他将螺旋桨放了空挡。飞机已经有了足够前进的推力，可以靠自身飞行了。

列宁娜从两脚中间的地板窗户向下望去，他们正飞过将中央伦敦和它的第一圈卫星郊区隔开的六公里宽的公园地带。绿地上面有许多缩小了的人，看上去像是蛆虫。狗狗离心碰碰球的高塔亮闪闪的，掩映在树林中。在牧羊人树丛附近，两千对贝塔－正在以混双形式打黎曼曲面网球。从诺丁山到威尔士登的主路两侧，排列着五号升降机球场。在伊令球场，一场德尔塔体操表演和社区歌曲演唱正在进行。

“卡其色可真难看！”列宁娜说，表达了她这个种姓的人在睡眠教育中形成的偏见。

豪恩斯洛感官电影制片厂占地七个半公顷。制片厂附近，一大队穿着黑色和卡其色服装的劳工正在忙碌地为西大路重新铺设玻璃路面。当他们飞过的时候，工人正在打开一个移动的巨大坩埚，融化的矿石倾泻出来，闪闪发光，滚滚地流向路面；石棉压路机来来往往；在一辆绝缘洒水车后面，水雾腾空而起，如同白色的云团。

在布伦特福德，电视机公司的工厂看起来就像个小城镇。

“他们一定是在换班。”列宁娜说。

穿着叶绿色衣服的伽马姑娘们，穿着黑色衣服的半白痴们，像蚜虫和蚂蚁一样，有的在入口处涌来涌去，有的在单轨电车旁排着队准备上车。穿着桑葚色衣服的贝塔－们在人群中走来走去。主楼的楼顶上，直升机不间断地降落或起飞，一片繁忙。

“天啊，”列宁娜说，“我真高兴我不是伽马。”

十分钟之后，他们已经到了斯托克波吉斯，玩起了第一局障碍高尔夫。





2


伯纳德匆匆走过楼顶，眼睛大多时候都低垂着，如果瞄到其他同伴，他会马上偷偷地掉转视线，就像背后有人追踪他一样，但他又不愿意看见追踪他的敌人，因为他害怕敌人比他预想的还要凶恶，害怕自己会显得更为内疚，显得更不可救药地孤独。

“那个可怕的本尼托·胡佛！”可是，那个人本意并不坏，某种意义上，这就让事情变得更糟糕了。那些好心人表现得和有坏心眼儿的人没有什么两样。连列宁娜都让他感到难受。他回忆起那几星期里自己是如何畏惧、如何犹豫，既盼望着能鼓起勇气邀请她，又因感到不够勇敢而心生绝望。他敢于面对她居高临下的拒绝带来的羞辱吗？可是，如果她同意了，哦，那将是多么高兴啊！现在，她已经同意了，可他还是觉得难过，她居然认为这是玩障碍高尔夫的好天气，她居然乐颠颠地跑过去找亨利·福斯特，她居然因为他不愿意在公众场合讨论私事儿觉得他可笑。一句话，他难过，是因为她和任何一个健康、品行良好的英国女孩的言行没有什么两样，毫无异常或出奇之处。

他打开机库的大门，招呼两个正在闲逛的德尔塔－服务员过来把他的飞机推到楼顶上。整个机库的工作人员都是来自一个波卡诺夫斯基组别的多胞胎，长得一模一样，矮小黝黑，很丑陋。伯纳德严厉地发出命令，语气傲慢，令人不快，表现得就像一个对自己的优越地位不太有把握的人。对伯纳德来说，和等级低于自己的人打交道一向不是什么愉快的经历。不知道怎么回事（那些有关他的代血浆里有酒精的传闻很可能是真的，因为这类事故总是可能会发生的），他比一个中等个子的伽马体格好不了多少。他比阿尔法的标准身高矮了八厘米，也单薄了许多。同低等级的人打交道总是让他想到自己身体上的缺陷，令他痛苦。“我就是我，可我希望不是。”他的自我意识非常强烈，令他烦恼。每当他发现自己在平视而不是俯视一个德尔塔的脸时，他就感到羞愧难当。这个家伙会不会因为他的种姓而给予他应得的尊敬？这个问题总是纠缠着他，可这也并非毫无道理。伽马、德尔塔和艾普西隆都受过一定的条件训练，将强壮的体格与优越的社会地位联系在一起。实际上，在睡眠教育中，他们都普遍接受了这种对大个头的偏爱。因此，每当他向女人求爱时，她们总是笑话他，同等种姓的男人们也经常开他的玩笑。那些嘲讽让他感觉自己像个局外人，有了这种感觉后，他真的就表现得像个局外人，这又加深了人们对他的偏见，加剧了人们对他的身体缺陷的鄙视和厌恶，反过来，这一切又进一步加深了他的局外感和孤独感。因为总是害怕被轻视，他总是刻意躲避同样等级的人。而在比他等级低的人看来，他的自尊心总是显得过分强烈。他多么羡慕像亨利·福斯特和本尼托·胡佛那样的男人！那样的男人从来不需要对艾普西隆们大喊大叫，就能让他们听从命令，他们心安理得地享受着自己的地位，他们在种姓制度之间轻车熟路，如鱼得水——他们那么怡然自得，根本意识不到自我，对于他们的等级带来的好处和舒适也熟视无睹。

在他看来，两个服务员在将他的飞机推到楼顶上时，动作懒散，好像不太情愿似的。

“快点！”伯纳德急躁地说。其中一个人看了他一眼。他从那双茫然的灰眼睛里觉察到的是畜生般的嘲弄吗？“快点！”他加大了声音喊道，声音干涩难听。

他爬进飞机，一分钟之后，他就在朝南，向着泰晤士河的方向飞去。

各个宣传局和情绪工程学院都位于舰队街的一座六十二层的大楼里。地下室和低楼层是伦敦三大报纸的印刷厂和办公室，它们分别是供高种姓人阅读的《每时广播》、淡绿色的《伽马公报》和印刷在卡其色纸张上、仅包括单音节文字的《德尔塔镜报》。往上的楼层是电视宣传局、感官电影宣传局、合成声音与音乐宣传局，总共占了二十二层。再往上，是各个研究实验室和一些墙壁四周镶了软垫的隔音房间，供那些音带作家和合成作曲家进行一些精细的工作。最上面的十八个楼层是情绪工程学院。

伯纳德降落在宣传大楼的楼顶上，从飞机上走了下来。

“给赫尔姆霍茨·华生先生的房间打个电话，”他命令那个伽马－看门人，“告诉他，伯纳德·马克斯先生在楼顶等他呢。”

他坐下来，点着了一支香烟。

消息传下去的时候，赫尔姆霍茨·华生正在写作。

“告诉他我马上来。”他说，放下了听筒，然后，他扭头转向秘书，“你把我的东西收拾好吧。”他对秘书明媚的微笑视若无睹，继续以公事公办的语气说，然后站起来，快步朝门口走去。

他身体结实，胸膛深厚，肩膀宽阔，非常魁梧，然而，他行动迅速，步履灵活、有弹性。结实的脖子像个圆柱，支撑着形状漂亮的脑袋。他长着黑黑的鬈发，五官分明。他英俊潇洒，帅气逼人。他的秘书总是不厌其烦地说，他身上的每一厘米都显示出他是个阿尔法＋。他的职业是情绪工程学院（写作系）的讲师，但在教书工作的间隙，他也做情绪工程师。他定期为《每时广播》写稿子，创作感官电影的剧本，他非常擅长编写各种口号和睡眠教育的顺口溜。

“能干，”这就是他的上司对他的评价，“可能（他们会摇摇头，意味深长地把声音放低）有点太能干了。”

是的，有点太能干了，他们说得对。超群的脑力在赫尔姆霍茨·华生身上产生的效果，和身体缺陷在伯纳德·马克斯身上产生的影响相差无几。骨架太小、肌肉太少这个事实让伯纳德孤立于同伴们之外，而根据流行的标准，如果这种隔绝感是由超群的脑力引发的，这种隔阂感会更加难以逾越。让赫尔姆霍茨·华生过于意识到自我、让他感到孤独的东西，就是他超凡的能力。这两个人有一个共同之处，那就是，他们都知道自己过于独特。但是，由于这种隔绝感，身体有缺陷的伯纳德几乎已经痛苦一生了，而赫尔姆霍茨·华生是不久前才意识到自己超人的脑力，意识到了自己和周围人的不同。这个升降机壁球冠军，这个不知疲倦的情人（有人说，他在不到四年内已经占有了六百四十个姑娘），这个令人钦佩的委员会成员，这个交际大师，最近突然意识到，对他本人而言，运动、女人、社会活动等都只不过是生命中退而求其次的事情。真的，在心灵深处，他对另外的某种东西更感兴趣，但是，那是什么东西呢？是什么呢？这就是伯纳德来和他谈论的问题，或者说，因为每次都是赫尔姆霍茨一个人在说话，是伯纳德来听他谈论的问题，是的，这次也是如此。

他刚走出电梯，三个合成声音宣传局的漂亮女孩就拦住了他。

“赫尔姆霍茨，亲爱的，一定要和我们一起去埃克斯荒原上野餐啊。”她们缠在他身边，乞求他。

他摇摇头，把她们推开，继续向前走。“不去，不去。”

“我们不邀请别的男人。”

即使这么诱人的承诺都不能动摇赫尔姆霍茨。“不去，”他又说了一遍，“我忙着呢。”他步履坚定地往前走，女孩子们在后面跟着他。直到他爬进伯纳德的飞机，砰地关上了机舱门，她们才不再追他了，对他不无谴责。

“这些女人！”他说，飞机跃升入天空，“这些女人啊！”他摇摇头，皱着眉头。“太糟糕了。”伯纳德虚伪地应和着，一边说着这种话，一边却暗地里希望，自己也能和赫尔姆霍茨一样，不费吹灰之力地占有那么多的女孩子。他突然产生了一种自我夸耀的迫切需要。“我要带列宁娜·克朗去新墨西哥。”他尽量让语气显得轻松随意。

“是吗？”赫尔姆霍茨说，一点也不感兴趣。停顿了一会儿，他接着说：“在过去的一两周，我一直在躲避着我的那些委员会会议和那些姑娘。你都想象不出来，为此，他们在学院里居然掀起了轩然大波。不过，我还是认为，这么做是值得的。这个结果嘛……”他迟疑着说，“结果很奇怪，真的很奇怪。”

身体的缺陷可以造成精神负担过重，而这个过程似乎是可逆的。精神负担过重本身，也可以让人蓄意地孤立自我，从而自觉地陷入盲目和聋聩状态，陷入禁欲主义人为的性无能。

在剩下的一段飞行中，他俩都没有说话。来到伯纳德的房间，舒舒服服地伸展着身子坐在充气沙发上之后，赫尔姆霍茨才继续刚才的话题。

他缓缓地说：“你是否有过这种感觉，好像你的身体里有种东西，就等着你给它一个机会，把它给释放出来？某种你现在还没有加以利用的多余力量？你知道的，就比如所有那些河水，没有流入涡轮发动机，而是形成瀑布倾泻而下了？”他带着疑问看着伯纳德。

“你是指，如果情况不同，我们可能会感觉到的那些情绪？”

赫尔姆霍茨摇摇头。“不完全是，我说的是，我偶尔会有一种奇怪的感觉，觉得我有什么非常重要的话要说，也有能力把它表达出来，可是，我不知道我要说的到底是什么，有能力也用不上。如果有一种不同的写作方式……或者有些别的东西可写……”他沉默了，然后接着说，“你看啊，我很擅长编写词语，你知道的，那种刺激得你突然跳起来的词语，就好像你坐到了一根针上似的，那些词语那么新奇，那么令人兴奋，尽管它们都是睡眠教育中的一些明显道理。可是，这些似乎还不够，光这些词语好听是没用的，这些词语得有意义才行呢。”

“你写的东西都很好啊，赫尔姆霍茨。”

“还差不多吧，”赫尔姆霍茨耸了耸肩，“但是，那些东西没什么大的影响，在某种意义上，它们还不够重要。我觉得自己还可以干更重要的事情。是的，更激烈、更猛烈的事情。可是什么呢？那些更重要的话语是什么？总写那些别人让你写的东西，你怎么可能做出猛烈的事情呢？词语就像X光射线，如果用得恰当，它们可以穿透一切。你去阅读时，就会感觉被刺到了。如何让写的东西具有穿透力，这就是我想教给我的学生的东西之一。可是，让一篇关于社区歌曲或者最新的香味乐器进展的文章穿透了，这又到底有什么用呢？况且，当你写那类玩意儿的时候，真的可以让词语具有穿透力吗？你知道的，就如同最强烈的X光射线那样？归根结底，这就是问题的所在。我试啊，试啊……”

“别出声！”伯纳德突然说，伸出一个手指头警告着。他们俩听了听。“我想门口有人。”他悄声说。

赫尔姆霍茨站起来，踮起脚尖穿过房间，突然快速打开房门。自然，门口一个人也没有。

“不好意思，”伯纳德说，觉得自己很傻，显得很难堪，“我想我最近神经有点紧张。当人们怀疑你时，你也会变得疑神疑鬼的。”

他用手抹了一下眼睛，叹了口气，声音变得惆怅起来。他在为自己辩解。“要是你知道我最近经受的那一切，”他几乎带着哭腔说，自我怜悯就像开了口的喷泉，“要是你知道就好了！”

赫尔姆霍茨·华生带着一丝不安听他说话。“可怜的小伯纳德。”他心里想。但同时，他也为自己的朋友感到羞惭，他真希望伯纳德能够表现得更有尊严。

第五章


1


到八点钟的时候，天空慢慢暗下来了。斯托克波吉斯俱乐部塔楼里的扩音器开始广播要关闭球场了，那声音是人类不可能发出的男高音。列宁娜和亨利停止打球，走回俱乐部。从内分泌和外分泌托拉斯的场地上，传来了成千上万头奶牛的哞哞叫声，这些牛群为法恩海姆皇家工厂提供原材料，即荷尔蒙和牛奶。

暮色中，到处都是直升机不间断的轰鸣声。每两分半钟，一声铃响和哨声就宣告一列轻型单轨火车的出发，这些火车将低种姓的高尔夫球手们从各自的球场运回城市。

列宁娜和亨利爬进飞机，出发了。在八百米的高空，亨利将螺旋桨的转速降低，有那么一两分钟，他们似乎悬停在空中，下面是渐渐暗淡的风景。伯恩海姆的桦树林就像一潭黑色的大水池，一直延伸向西方天空的明亮边缘。天际线变得红彤彤的，落日最后的余晖渐渐淡下去了，先是橙红色，之后变成黄色，再稍后是水汪汪的淡绿色。向北望去，比树林更高更远的地方，是内分泌和外分泌工厂，二十层楼的每个窗户都灯火通明。下面是高尔夫俱乐部的大楼——低种姓人的营房般的巨大建筑，分隔墙的另一边，是留给阿尔法和贝塔成员的较小的房子。那些低种姓的人正走在通往单轨火车站的路上，黑压压的，如蚂蚁一般。一列闪着灯光的火车从车站的玻璃顶棚下面疾驰而出。顺着火车在黑暗的平原上向东南方向的行驶路线，他们两个人的目光不禁被斯劳火葬场的庞大建筑吸引住了。为了这些夜行飞机的安全着想，火葬场的四个高高的烟囱都打开了探照灯，点亮了紫红色的警示信号。这是一个地标。

“为什么那些烟囱旁边都有像阳台那样的东西？”列宁娜问道。

“磷回收。”亨利简单地解释，“在沿着烟囱上升的过程中，气体会经历四种不同的工序。过去，每次焚化死人的时候，五氧化二磷都流失了。现在，他们可以回收其中的百分之九十八。每具成年人的尸体可以回收一千五百多克磷，这样，仅仅在英格兰，每年就可以回收将近四百吨的磷。”亨利说话的时候既高兴又得意，全心全意地为这个成就感到高兴，好像这全是他个人创造的成就，“想想我们死后还能为社会所用，真是开心呀，能够帮助植物生长。”

这时，列宁娜的眼睛已经移向别处了，她正在垂直向下俯瞰单轨火车站。“确实开心，”她表示同意，“可奇怪的是，阿尔法和贝塔并不比下面那些丑陋矮小的伽马、德尔塔和艾普西隆更能帮助植物生长呀。”

“所有人在生理和化学成分上都是平等的。”亨利简洁地说，“另外，即使是艾普西隆们也做着不可或缺的贡献。”

“即使是一个艾普西隆……”列宁娜突然记起，有一次，那时她还是个小女孩，还在学校读书，睡到半夜她醒来了，第一次意识到那些睡觉时一直萦绕在她耳边的窃窃私语。她眼前再次浮现出那道月光、那排白色的小床；耳边再次响起那个轻柔的声音（那些话就在那里，清清楚楚，难以忘却，重复了那么多个夜晚）：“每个人都为别人工作。我们离不开任何人。即使是艾普西隆也有用。我们离不开艾普西隆们。每个人都为别人工作。我们离开别人是不行的……”列宁娜回想起当时的恐惧和惊讶，在醒着的半个小时里她有种种猜测，然后，听着那没完没了的重复，她的心情逐渐平复，平复，平复，然后睡眠悄然来临……

“我想，艾普西隆们不太介意自己是艾普西隆吧。”她说。

“当然不介意了。怎么可能介意呢？他们又不知道作为其他种姓的人会是什么样。当然，我们会介意的，但那是因为我们所受到的条件训练不同。并且，我们的遗传从一开始就和他们不一样。”

“我很高兴我不是艾普西隆。”列宁娜肯定地说。

“如果你是艾普西隆的话，”亨利说，“你所受的训练会让你同样心怀感激的，你会因为不是阿尔法或贝塔而感到高兴。”他将前进的推进器挂上挡，驾驶飞机朝伦敦飞去。在他们身后，在西方，天空中的深红色和橙红色几乎全部消逝了，暗黑的厚重云团爬向了天际。他们飞过火葬场的时候，从烟囱里冒出的热气流令飞机陡然上升，过了这里，飞到远处下沉的冷空气里后，飞机才突然下降。

“多么奇妙的颠簸起伏！”列宁娜开心地笑了。

但是，亨利的语气一度还是有点伤感。“你知道刚才那个起伏意味着什么吗？”他说，“那就是说，某个人最终消失了，确确实实地消失了，随着一股热气升上去了。我都有点好奇，想知道那是谁，是男人还是女人，是阿尔法还是艾普西隆……”他叹口气，然后，他果断地换上了快活的语气，“无论怎样，”他总结道，“有一件事，我们是肯定的，不管他是谁，他活着的时候都很幸福。现在每个人都很幸福。”

“是的，现在每个人都很幸福。”列宁娜应和着。连续十二年，他们每天晚上都听到这句话，每次重复一百五十遍。

他们降落在威斯敏斯特区亨利居住的一座四十层公寓楼的楼顶上，然后直接去了餐厅。在餐厅，和一大群喧闹快活的人一起，他们吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐。随咖啡一起端上来的还有唆麻。列宁娜吃了两个半克的药片，亨利吃了三个。九点二十分，他们穿过街道，来到新开张的威斯敏斯特歌舞厅。这是个几乎无云的夜晚，天空中看不见月亮，只有点点星光。不过，幸好列宁娜和亨利两人都没有注意到这个有点令人压抑的情景。高空的电子灯光标示牌有效地遮住了外界的黑暗。“卡尔文·斯托普和他的十六位色克斯管演奏员(1)共同登台。”在新威斯敏斯特歌舞厅的门面上，巨大的字母闪耀着诱人的光：“伦敦最好的色香乐队；最新的合成音乐。”

他俩走了进去。里面的空气很热，并且因为龙涎香和檀香香气的缘故，有点让人透不过气来。在大厅圆拱形的天花板上，配色机已经绘制了一幅热带的日落图。十六位色克斯管演奏员正在吹奏一支喜闻乐见的老曲子：“世界上没有一个瓶子，比得上我那个可爱的小瓶子。”四百对舞伴正在锃亮的地板上跳着五步舞，列宁娜和亨利很快就加入，成为第四百零一对。色克斯管呜咽着，如同月光下猫咪在动听地吟唱着，女低音部和男高音部也在呻吟着，好像他们在经历着一次小小的死亡。在丰富的和声伴奏下，他们颤抖的合唱声逐渐升高，达到高潮，声音愈来愈大，直到最后，随着乐队指挥一挥手，顿时，从空中传来这仙乐的横扫一切的最后余音，将十六个人世间的乐手几乎吹到九霄云外。A降调如雷鸣般地怒吼，之后在几乎完全的寂静中，在几乎完全的黑暗中，声音似乎变得透明了起来，一丝一丝地逐渐减弱，下滑，以四分音的梯级，减弱，下滑，最后，主旋律变成一种微弱的私语（背景中依然搏动着五四拍的节奏）萦绕其间，把一种强烈的期盼赋予了那片刻的黑暗。终于，这期盼得到了满足。突然，爆炸般地，旭日高升，同时，十六人乐队开始放声高歌：

“我的瓶子哦，你是我长久以来的企盼！

我的瓶子，为什么要把我换瓶？

在你的怀里，天空是那么蔚蓝，

天上永远是阳光灿烂；

世界上没有一个瓶子哦，

能比我的那个更可爱、更完美。”

列宁娜和亨利与另外四百对舞伴一起，围着威斯敏斯特歌舞厅在跳五步舞，但是，他们二人同时也在另一个世界里转着，转着，那是个温暖的、色彩斑斓的世界，是唆麻假日里那个无限友好的世界。人们都多么善良，多么好看，多么有趣啊！“我的瓶子哦，你是我长久以来的企盼……”但是，列宁娜和亨利已经拥有了他们所期盼的东西……他们就在瓶子的怀抱里呢，就在此时此刻，在明媚的天气和永远蔚蓝的天空下，一起安全地待在他们的瓶子里。当十六人乐队最后精疲力竭，放下色克斯管后，合成音乐器还在播放着最新的悠缓的马尔萨斯布鲁斯。他们二人简直就像两个同卵双胞胎的胚胎，互相拥抱着，一起在代血浆大海的浪涛中轻轻摇荡着。

“晚安，亲爱的朋友们。晚安，亲爱的朋友们。”扩音器里传出亲切悦耳的声音，这礼貌掩盖着命令，“晚安，亲爱的朋友们……”与其他人一样，列宁娜和亨利顺从地离开了大楼。令人压抑的星星已经在天际走了一大段路，但是，虽然空中那些阻隔视野的招牌大多已经消失了，两个年轻人依然高高兴兴，丝毫没有意识到身处暗夜。

还差半个小时到关门时间时，他俩又吞服了第二剂唆麻，对二人来说，在现实世界和脑中的虚幻世界之间，唆麻竖起了一道不可逾越的高墙。犹如身处瓶子的怀抱，他俩穿过街道；犹如身处瓶子的怀抱，他俩搭乘电梯来到亨利位于二十八层的公寓。可是，尽管列宁娜依然处在瓶子的怀抱中，尽管她第二次服用了唆麻，她也没有忘记按照规定必须要采取的所有避孕措施。多年密集的睡眠教育，从十二岁到十七岁，每周三次的马尔萨斯操练，让采取这些措施几乎成为某种自动的、不可避免的程序，就像眨眼睛一样。

“哦，这提醒我了，”她从卫生间回来后说，“范妮·克朗想知道，你送给我的这种可爱的绿色代摩洛哥皮革的腰带，是从哪里买到的？”

隔周的周四是伯纳德参加团结礼拜仪式的日子。在“爱神之家”（按照第二条规则，赫尔姆霍茨刚刚入选其委员会）早早吃了晚饭后，他同朋友道了别，在楼顶叫了架出租飞机，告诉飞行员他要去福帝森社区唱堂(2)。飞机上升了几百米，然后向东飞行，拐过弯后，浮现在伯纳德眼前的恢宏壮丽的建筑就是会堂了。会堂灯光如炽，高达三百二十米的白色代大理石建筑闪闪发光，将路德盖特山上映照得一片雪白；在楼顶直升机平台的四个角上，各摆放着一块巨大的T字形石头，在黑夜中闪耀着深红色的光；二十四个金色大喇叭鸣奏着庄严的合成音乐。

“倒霉，来晚了。”伯纳德第一眼看到会堂的大亨利钟(3)时，心里想。确实，他还在付出租飞机钱时，大亨利钟就敲响了。“福帝，”所有的金色喇叭里传出了洪亮的低音，“福帝，福帝，福帝……”连着鸣响九次。伯纳德向电梯跑去。

大楼的底层是一个宽敞的礼堂，可以举行福帝日庆祝活动和其他群众性社区歌唱活动。上面的每一层都各有一百个房间，总共有七千个房间，供团结小组做每两周一次的礼拜仪式。伯纳德下降到第三十三层，匆匆跑过走廊，站在3210房间门口，犹豫了一会儿，然后，他鼓足勇气，推开门走了进去。

感谢福帝！他不是最后一个到的。摆放在圆桌周围的十二把椅子有三把还空着。他溜到最近的一把椅子上坐下，尽量不引起他人的注意，同时准备好冲着来得更晚的人皱眉头，不管那两人是谁。

他左边的女孩转过身来。“你今天下午玩什么了？”她问他，“障碍高尔夫还是电磁高尔夫？”

伯纳德看看她（福帝呀！是摩根娜·罗斯柴尔德），红着脸，告诉她，自己两种都没有玩。摩根娜吃惊地盯着他。一阵尴尬的沉默。

然后，她突然转过身去，跟她左边那个更喜欢运动的男子聊天去了。

“这个团结礼拜仪式可真是开了个好头啊。”伯纳德痛苦地想，预见到自己实现救赎的努力会再次失败。如果他在溜到最近的椅子上之前，先看一眼就好了！他本可以坐在菲菲·布莱德拉夫和琼娜·迪塞尔之间的，可他却糊里糊涂地把自己杵在了摩根娜旁边。摩根娜！福帝呀！她那两道粗黑的眉头，确切地说，那一道眉毛，因为她的眉头在鼻子上方几乎连到了一起。福帝！他的右边是克拉拉·德特丁。必须承认，克拉拉的眉毛没有长到一起，可是，她的胸脯也太丰满了点吧。而菲菲和琼娜都绝对刚刚好：丰满，金发，个头不太大……现在，那个大笨蛋，汤姆·川口，坐在了她俩中间的椅子上。

最后到的是撒柔吉尼·恩格斯。

“你迟到了，”小组长严厉地说，“以后不能再这样了。”撒柔吉尼道着歉，溜进了吉姆·波卡诺夫斯基和赫伯特·巴库宁中间的座位。本小组的人都来齐了，团结圈儿圆满了，完美无缺。男人，女人，男人，不断地互相交替，围着桌子绕成圆圈。十二个人都准备着，要与大家合为一体，等待着连接在一起，融合到一起，在更大的生命中失去各自不同的个体身份。

组长站了起来，划了个T字，打开合成音乐，播放出轻柔、不知疲倦的鼓点和各种乐器的合奏，既有管乐，也有弦乐，一遍遍地重复着第一首团结赞美诗那简洁的旋律。洪亮、不可逃避的声音萦绕着，萦绕着，一遍，又一遍，听到这搏动的声音的并不是耳朵，而是下腹部；这重复来重复去的和鸣，各种呜呜声和叮当声，缠绕的不是头脑，而是渴望同情的五脏六腑。

组长又划了个T字，坐下了。仪式开始了。捐献的唆麻片放在了桌子中间。草莓冰激凌味的唆麻爱之杯，从一个人的手上传递到下一个人的手上，大家嘴上念叨着祈祷语“我为我的消失而干杯”，十二次的痛饮。之后，在合成管弦乐的伴奏下，大家唱起了第一首团结赞美诗。

“福帝，我们是十二个；

哦，让我们成为一体吧，

成为社会之河中的水滴，

哦，让我们一起跑吧，

快得像您那闪亮的轿车。”

十二段充满渴望的诗节。爱之杯再次传递一圈。“我为更伟大的生命而干杯”是这次的祈祷语。所有人都喝了。音乐依旧不知疲倦地演奏着，鼓点响着，呜呜呜，叮叮当，乐器的和鸣声缠绕回响，几乎要将五脏六腑融化掉。大家唱起了第二首团结赞美诗。

“来吧，更伟大的生命，社会之友，

毁灭十二个，合成为一个！

我们渴望消亡，只有那时，

我们的大我才能生成。”

还是十二个诗节。此时，唆麻开始显效了。眼睛发亮了，脸蛋变红了，内心的博爱之光照亮了每个人的脸颊，每个人的脸上都洋溢着幸福、友好的微笑。就连伯纳德都觉得自己有点融化了。当摩根娜·罗斯柴尔德扭过脸冲着他微笑时，他也尽力报以微笑。但是，那道眉毛，那道合二为一的黑眉毛，哎呀，还在那里，他无法忽视它的存在，再怎么努力都做不到。融化的程度还不够。如果他坐在菲菲和琼娜中间的话，可能……爱之杯第三次开始传递了，“我为他即将来临而干杯。”摩根娜·罗斯柴尔德说，这次轮到她启动这个圆圈仪式。她的声音高亢兴奋。她一番痛饮，把杯子递给伯纳德。“我为他即将来临而干杯。”伯纳德重复一遍，真心地希望能够感觉到“他”马上就要来临，可是，那道眉毛还是纠缠着他，对他而言，那个伟大的来临还遥远得可怕呢。他喝了之后，将杯子传给克拉拉·德特丁。“这次又失败了。”他自言自语，“我就知道会这样的。”但是，他仍然尽可能地微笑着。爱之杯又传了一圈。组长举起一只手，发出信号，合唱爆发为第三首团结赞美诗。

“感受吧，更伟大的生命到来了！

欢乐吧，在欢乐中消逝！

融化在鼓点的音乐中！

我就是你，你就是我。”

一首诗接着一首诗，随着大家越来越激动，声音开始颤抖。伟大生命即将降临之感充斥在空气中，如同充了电一般刺激、紧张。组长关掉音乐，随着最后一段的最后一个音符消失，出现了绝对的寂静，过度期待造成的寂静，它战栗着，爬行着，如同带了电的生命。组长伸出一只手，突然，一个声音，一个深沉洪亮的声音，比人类的任何声音都更悦耳、更丰富、更温暖的声音，因为爱、渴望和同情而颤抖的声音，一个美妙、神秘、超自然的声音，在他们上方说话了，非常缓慢地：“哦，福帝，福帝，福帝。”声音逐渐减弱，声调逐渐降低。听到这声音的人们顿时激动万分，感觉到一股温暖从太阳穴辐射到身体的每个角落。泪水涌入他们的眼睛，他们的心、他们的五脏六腑似乎都在涌动，如同拥有了独立的生命。“福帝哦！”他们在融化，“福帝！”他们融化了，消失了。然后，令人吃惊地，这声音突然换了一种语气：“听！”声音如同喇叭。“听！”他们聆听着。停顿了一会儿后，声音降为细语，但不知怎么回事，这细语却比最高亢的呼喊更具有穿透力。“更伟大的生命的脚步声。”声音继续着，重复着，“更伟大的生命的脚步声。”细语声几乎听不见了，“楼梯上响起了更伟大的生命的脚步声。”再一次的沉寂，刚刚松懈了一点的期待又一次绷紧了，越来越紧，几乎到了崩溃的边缘。更伟大的生命的脚步声，哦，他们听到了，他们听见了，轻轻地沿楼梯走下来了，沿着看不见的楼梯，“他”越走越近了。更伟大的生命的脚步声。突然，崩溃的一刻到来了。摩根娜·罗斯柴尔德跳了起来，眼睛瞪着，嘴巴大张着。

“我听见他了，”她喊道，“我听见他了。”

“他来了。”撒柔吉尼·恩格斯喊叫着。

“是的，他来了，我听见了。”菲菲·布莱德拉夫和汤姆·川口同时站了起来。

“哦，哦，哦！”琼娜含混不清地作证。

“他来了！”吉姆·波卡诺夫斯基大叫。

组长身体前倾，轻轻一按开关，顿时响起镲钹和铜管乐发烧般的呓语，一阵咚咚咚、锵锵锵。

“哦，他来了！”克拉拉·德特丁尖叫起来，“啊咿！”好像有人在割她的喉咙。

伯纳德感到他也该做点什么，于是跳了起来，喊叫着：“我听见他了，他来了。”这不是真话。他什么都没有听到，对他而言，谁都没有来。没有人，尽管音乐轰鸣，尽管周围的人越来越兴奋。但是，他挥舞着手臂，和他们中最激动的人一起喊叫着。看到其他人开始摇摆、跺脚、拖着步子跳起舞来，他也开始跟着摇摆跳舞。

他们转着圈跳着，围成了一个圈，每个人都把双手放在前面一个跳舞者的腰胯部，一圈又一圈，一起喊叫着，随着音乐的节奏，他们跺着脚，双手拍打着前面人的屁股。十二个人的手同时在拍打，犹如一个人；十二个屁股拍得啪啪作响，十二个人合为一人，十二合一。“我听见他了，我听见他来了。”音乐节奏加快了，跺脚更快了，加快，加快，敲击节奏的手也加快了。突然，传来一个响亮的合成低音，宣布救赎的到来，社会团结的实现，十二合一的到来，以及更伟大的生命的现身。“狂欢吧，狂欢吧。”这声音唱着，咚咚的鼓点继续敲打出狂热的节奏。

“狂欢吧，福帝呀，玩乐吧，

亲吻姑娘吧，合二为一；

小伙姑娘合二为一，

一切才能安宁；

狂欢吧，释放吧。”

“狂欢吧，”跳舞的人跟着这祈祷词般的叠句唱了起来，“狂欢吧，福帝呀，玩乐吧，亲吻姑娘吧……”他们唱着唱着，灯光逐渐暗下来，暗下来，同时，灯光变暖了，变得更丰富，也更红了，最后，他们几乎是在胚胎库里那种朦胧的暗红色中舞蹈了。“狂欢吧……”舞蹈者在胚胎库里那种血红色的黑暗中又继续转了一会儿，击打着，不知疲倦地击打着节奏。“狂欢吧……”然后，圆圈渐渐动摇了，散开了，人们两两一起躺倒在四周围成一圈的长沙发上，长沙发将圆桌和椅子套在中间，一圈套一圈。“狂欢吧……”那个低沉的声音温柔地低吟着，轻唱着，在朦胧的暗红色中，好像有只巨大的黑鸽子正在此刻颠鸾倒凤的这些人上空盘旋着，爱意绵绵。




他们站在楼顶上，大亨利钟刚刚敲过十一点。夜是平静的、温暖的。

“刚才多么美妙啊，不是吗？”菲菲·布莱德拉夫说，“多么美妙啊！”她望着伯纳德，一脸的狂喜，这种狂喜里没有一丁点激动或兴奋的痕迹，因为兴奋是不满足的表现。她的狂喜是心满意足后的狂喜，是平静的狂喜。她获得的安宁，不仅出于空洞的满足和满足后的无聊，而且是来自平衡的生命，来自安宁和平衡的精力，这是丰富、生动的安宁。团结礼拜仪式不仅索取，而且给予，取走就是为了补充。她完整了，完美了，不再仅仅是她自己。“难道你不认为刚才非常美妙吗？”她还在追问，看着伯纳德的脸，眼睛亮得出奇。

“是啊，我觉得非常美妙。”他在撒谎，眼睛望向了别处。对他而言，她那张容光焕发的脸既是对他的指责，又是颇具讽刺性的提醒，提醒着他的与众不同。此刻，他和仪式刚开始的时候没有什么两样，依然是那么悲惨，那么孤立，或者说，因为他那未得到满足的空虚，或者说他那死板的满足，他感到更加孤立了。当其他人都已融入那更伟大的生命时，他仍然是孤立的，未得到救赎，即使在摩根娜的怀抱中，他也是孤独的，或者说更加孤独了，确实如此，感觉比他生命中的任何时刻都更加孤独无望。当他从那朦胧的暗红色中醒来，再次为普通电灯照耀时，他越发地意识到自我的存在，这令他痛苦难耐。他难受极了，或许（她闪闪发亮的眼睛在指责他），这全是他自己的错。“太美妙了。”他重复了一遍，但是，他能回忆起来的只有摩根娜的那道眉毛。

第六章


1


古怪，古怪，太古怪了，这是列宁娜对伯纳德·马克斯的评价。实际上，他太古怪了，以至于在接下来的几周里，列宁娜不止一次地考虑她是否应该改变主意，不去新墨西哥度假了，而是和本尼托·胡佛一块儿去北极。可问题是，她去过北极，去年夏天和乔治·埃德泽尔一块儿去的，还有，她觉得北极太阴冷了。在那儿没有什么事情可做，宾馆也老旧得要命，卧室里没有电视，没有香味乐器，只有那种最糟糕的合成音乐，两百多个客人却只有二十五个升降机壁球场可用。不，她绝对不能再去北极了。况且，她只去过美国一次，就那一次，还玩得不够尽兴！只在纽约度了个可怜的周末，是和让·雅克·哈比杜拉还是和波卡诺夫斯基·琼斯一起去的来着？她都记不起来了，反正，那一次没有什么重要的。再次飞往西部，而且是整整一周，想想都够诱人的。另外，那一周里，至少有三天时间他们都会待在野蛮人保留地。整个孵化与训练中心里，只有六七个人曾经到过野蛮人保留地。伯纳德是个阿尔法＋心理学家，在她认识的人中，他是拥有许可证的为数不多的男人之一。对列宁娜来说，这次机会是非常难得的。但是，伯纳德的古怪也真够罕见的，她都有点犹豫要不要接受邀请了，甚至都在考虑：要不要再冒一次险，和滑稽的本尼托再去一趟北极？至少，本尼托还是正常的，而伯纳德……“代血浆里的酒精。”范妮对伯纳德的每一个奇怪之处都这么解释。但是，有一次和亨利在床上时，列宁娜满腹忧虑地谈起她的新情人，亨利却把可怜的伯纳德比喻成一头犀牛。

“你没法教一头犀牛玩花样。”他以惯有的简洁有力的风格解释道，“有些男人具有犀牛的特质，他们对条件训练的反应不太正常。可怜的家伙们！伯纳德就是其中之一。幸运的是，他工作干得不错，否则，主任才不会留着他呢。不过，”他安慰似的加了一句，“我觉得他没有什么恶意。”

没有恶意，也许吧，但是也够叫人不放心的。首先，就是他那个喜欢独自做事情的怪癖，那其实意味着，什么事都没有做啊，独自一人又能做点什么呢？（当然，上床睡觉除外，可是，也不能总是做这一件事啊。）是啊，能有什么事可做呢？少得可怜。他俩第一次一起外出的那个下午，天气特别好。列宁娜建议去托盖乡村俱乐部游泳，然后去牛津联合会吃晚餐，可是，伯纳德觉得那里人太多了。那么，去圣安德鲁斯玩电磁高尔夫球怎么样？还是不行，伯纳德认为电磁高尔夫是浪费时间。

“那么，时间是用来干什么的呢？”列宁娜吃惊地问。

很显然，是用来到湖区散步的，因为，随后伯纳德提出去湖区。把飞机降落在斯基道的山顶上，然后在石楠丛中漫步一两个小时。“单独和你在一起，列宁娜。”

“可是，伯纳德，我们整个晚上都会单独在一起呀。”

伯纳德涨红了脸，望向别处。“我的意思是，单独在一起，聊聊天。”他咕哝着说。

“聊天？可是聊什么呢？”散步，聊天，就那样过一个下午，可真够奇怪的。

最终，尽管他很不情愿，但她说服了他，飞到阿姆斯特丹，去看女子重量级摔跤比赛的四分之一决赛。“还是跟一堆人在一起。”他抱怨着。整个下午，他都固执地阴沉着脸，不愿意和列宁娜的朋友们讲话（在摔跤比赛间隙，他们在冰淇淋唆麻店遇到了几十个列宁娜的朋友）；还有，即使他很不开心，也绝不接受她塞给他的含半克唆麻的树莓圣代。“我宁愿做我自己，”他说，“做我自己，继续讨人嫌，也不愿意成为别人，再快乐也不愿意。”

“及时的一克胜过九克。”列宁娜说，从睡眠教育的智慧宝库中拿出一条。伯纳德不耐烦地推开了她递过来的杯子。

“你看，不要发脾气。”她说，“记住，吃下一小片，烦恼都不见。”

“哦，看着福帝的分上，住嘴！”他喊道。

列宁娜耸了耸肩。“唆麻一片，摆脱苦难。”她颇有尊严地总结道，自己把圣代喝下去了。

在回来的途中，飞越英吉利海峡的时候，伯纳德坚持要关上推进器，仅靠着直升机的螺旋桨，在海浪上方一百英尺处悬停一段时间。天气突然变糟了，刮起了西南风，天空乌云密布。

“看。”他命令她。

“可是，这太恐怖了。”列宁娜说，从窗口缩回来。飞速袭来的夜晚的空旷感，下方泡沫飞溅的汹涌的黑色海水，在匆匆掠过的云团中显得那么憔悴、那么烦恼的苍白月亮，这一切把列宁娜吓坏了。“打开收音机吧，快点！”她伸手去够仪表盘上的旋钮，随意打开了一个台。

“……在你的怀里，天空是那么蔚蓝，”十六个颤抖的假声在唱着，“天上永远……”

然后，收音机发出打嗝一般的声音，陷入沉默。伯纳德把电源给关了。

“我想静静地看看大海，”他说，“听着这么个鬼声音，连大海也看不好。”

“多好听啊。我不想看了。”

“可我想看，”他坚持道，“让我感觉好像……”他迟疑着，寻找着合适的词汇来表达自己的感受，“好像我更是我自己了，如果你明白我的意思。我更加独立，而不是别的什么东西的一部分，不仅仅是社会肌体中的一个细胞。列宁娜，你有没有这种感觉？”

列宁娜在哭。“太可怕了，太可怕了。”她不断地说，“你怎么能那么说话呢，说自己不想成为社会肌体的一部分？毕竟，每个人都为别人工作。我们离不开任何人。即使是艾普西隆……”

“是的，我知道，”伯纳德讥讽地说，“‘即使是艾普西隆也有用’！我也一样。可我真他妈的希望我没有用处！”

他这番亵渎的话令列宁娜大吃一惊。“伯纳德！”她抗议着，又吃惊，又痛苦，“你怎么能这么说话？”

他换了个调子。“我怎么能这么说话？”他重复着，若有所思，“不，真正的问题是，为什么我不能，或者说——因为，毕竟，我非常清楚我为什么不能这么说话——如果我能这么说的话，事情会是什么样的，如果我是自由的——如果我没有被受过的条件训练奴役的话。”

“可是，伯纳德，你说的这些都太骇人听闻了。”

“难道你不希望自己是自由的吗，列宁娜？”

“我不明白你的意思。我是自由的。自由地享受最美妙的时光。现在每个人都很幸福。”

他笑了。“是啊，‘现在每个人都很幸福’。从孩子们五岁起，我们就教他们这个。可是，难道你不希望能够以其他的方式自由地追求幸福吗，列宁娜？比如，以你自己的方式，而不是和大家都一样？”

“我不明白你的意思。”她重复了一遍，接着，她转向他，“哦，我们回去吧，伯纳德，”她乞求他，“我不喜欢这里。”

“你不喜欢和我在一起吗？”

“当然喜欢了，伯纳德。我是不喜欢这个鬼地方。”

“我以为，我们两个在这里可以变得更……更接近，只有大海和月亮陪着我们。比在人群中更接近，甚至比在我的房间里还要更接近彼此。难道你不明白吗？”

“我什么都不明白，”她果断地说，决心继续糊涂着，“不明白，一点都不明白。”她换了种语气，继续说，“你产生那些可怕想法的时候，为什么不吃点唆麻呢？你会忘掉那一切的。不再难过，而是非常快活，那么快活。”她重复了一遍。尽管她的眼睛里依然充满迷惑和焦虑，她还是微笑了，希望能够以自己的魅力和妖艳来劝服他。

他默默地看着她，脸上没有任何反应，非常严肃，专心地看着她。过了一会儿，列宁娜的眼睛退缩了，她紧张地笑了一下，想说点什么，可什么都想不出来。沉默继续着。

伯纳德最后开口了，声音低沉而疲惫。“那好吧，”他说，“我们回去。”他狠狠地踩了一下加速器，飞机呼地冲上高空。在四千米的高空，他发动了推进器。他们沉默地飞了一两分钟。然后，突然地，伯纳德开始大笑起来。列宁娜想，他笑得太古怪了，不过，总归是笑啊。

“感觉好点了吗？”她鼓起勇气问道。

作为回答，他将一只手从控制板上拿开，揽住她，开始玩弄她的乳房。

“感谢福帝，”她心里想，“他终于正常了。”

半小时之后，他们回到了他的房间。伯纳德一口气吞了四片唆麻，打开收音机和电视机，开始脱衣服。




“喂，”第二天下午他们在楼顶见面的时候，列宁娜带着俏皮，意味深长地问他，“你觉得昨天好玩不？”

伯纳德点点头。他们爬进了飞机。轻微的颠簸之后，他们出发了。

“每个人都说我太丰满了。”列宁娜拍拍两腿，若有所思地说。

“是太丰满了。”伯纳德的眼睛里有一种痛苦的表情。“就像一团肉。”他心里想。

她有点担心地抬头看着他。“你是不是认为我太胖了？”

他摇摇头。就像一大团肉。

“你觉得我很好？”又一次点头。“每个方面都是？”

“完美无缺。”他说，心里却在想：“她就是这么看她自己的。她不在乎自己就是一团肉。”

列宁娜微笑了，很得意。但她满意得太早了。

“尽管如此，”他停顿了一会儿，继续说，“我还是希望结果不是这样的。”

“不是这样？”还有其他的结果吗？

“我不希望我们最终以上床了事。”他说得更明白了。

列宁娜大感诧异。

“不是马上上床，不是第一天就上床。”

“可是，那么……”

他开始大谈特谈他那些玄奥又危险的废话。列宁娜尽可能地堵住她心灵的耳朵，可是，还是有一两个词时不时地钻进来。“试试抑制我的本能会有什么结果。”她听见他在说。这些词语似乎触动了她脑海里的某个弹簧。

“永远不要把今天可以享受的事情推迟到明天。”她郑重其事地说。

“从十四岁到十六岁半，每周两次，每次两百遍的重复。”这是他唯一的评价，他疯狂的呓语还在继续，“我想了解什么是激情，”她听见他在说，“我想体验强烈的感情。”

“当个人产生感情，社会就地动山摇。”列宁娜宣告。

“干吗不可以让它摇一摇、动一动呢？”

“伯纳德！”

可是伯纳德一点不觉得羞愧。

“心智上是成年人，工作的时候是成年人，”他继续说，“在感情和欲望方面，却还是孩子。”

“可我们的福帝爱小孩子。”

对她的打岔，伯纳德毫不理会，继续说：“那天，我突然想到，我们完全可以一直做成年人。”

“我不明白。”列宁娜的语气非常坚定。

“我知道你不懂。所以，昨天我们才上床了，就像孩子，而不是像个成年人那样，等待一段时间。”

“可我们这么做很有趣啊，”列宁娜坚持着，“你不觉得吗？”

“哦，最有趣不过了。”他回答，可是声音那么悲伤，表情那么痛苦，列宁娜顿时感到自己的得意之情烟消云散了。

归根到底，他可能还是觉得自己太胖了。

“我告诉过你的，”范妮只说了这句，列宁娜是来找她倾诉心事的，“是因为他们在他的代血浆里倒入了酒精。”

“无论如何，”列宁娜坚持说，“我还是喜欢他的。他的手太漂亮了。还有他耸动肩膀的样子，非常迷人。”列宁娜叹了口气，“可是，我真希望他不要那么古怪。”

伯纳德在主任办公室的门外站了一会儿，深深地吸了口气，挺起胸脯，鼓足勇气去面对他肯定会遭遇的厌烦和不满。他敲了敲门，进去了。

“主任，有一份许可证，需要您批准。”他尽量说得轻松一些，然后把文件放在写字桌上。

主任不快地看了他一眼，可是，文件的上方盖着世界控制官办公室的印章，穆斯塔法·蒙德的名字，又粗又黑，就签在页面的下方，手续齐备，无可挑剔。主任没有选择，他只好签上了自己名字的首字母，把两个小得可怜、灰不溜秋的字母签在了“穆斯塔法·蒙德”的下面。主任本想一句话也不说，连“福帝保佑你”的话都不说，就把许可证还给伯纳德，这时，他突然注意到了证件的内容。

“去新墨西哥保留地？”他说，他的语气和扬起来对着伯纳德的脸都透着某种不安和诧异。

对于主任的吃惊，伯纳德也吃了一惊，他点点头。一阵沉默。

主任往椅子背上靠了靠，眉头紧皱。“那是多久以前了？”他说，比起对伯纳德说话，更像是自言自语，“我想有二十多年了，快二十五年了。我那时一定和你现在差不多大……”他叹口气，摇摇头。伯纳德感到非常不自在。主任是那么一个严守传统、那么刻意遵从常规的人，现在却出现这么严重的失态！这让他想捂住脸，跑出房间。他自己倒不觉得谈论那么遥远的过去的事情有什么本质上令人厌恶的，睡眠教育里教给他的那些偏见中，他早已经彻底摆脱了这一条（至少他觉得是这样的）。令他感到不好意思的是，主任不赞成这一点，可他却在不知不觉中做了自己不赞成的事情。是在怎样的内在驱动之下做的？虽然感到不自在，但伯纳德还是怀着急切的心情听着。

“我那时跟你的想法一样，”主任说，“想去看看那些野蛮人。拿到了去新墨西哥的许可证，去那里过暑假，是和我那时正在交往的女孩一起去的。她是贝塔－，我想（他闭上了眼睛），我想她长着黄色的头发。反正她挺丰满的，特别丰满，我还记得这个。总之，我们去了那里，我们看到了那些野蛮人，我们骑着马到处逛，诸如此类的事。然后，就要到最后一天了，然后……她就失踪了。那天，我们骑马去了那些讨厌的山峰中的一座，天气又热又闷，午饭后我们睡着了，至少我是睡着了。她一定是去散步了，独自一个人去的。反正，我醒来的时候，她不在那里。当时，突然下起了我所见过的最可怕的雷阵雨，大雨倾盆而下，雷声隆隆，电光闪闪。马匹挣脱开，跑掉了，我想抓住它们时，摔了一跤，伤了膝盖，几乎都不能走路了。我还是找啊，喊啊，找啊。可是，还是看不见她的影子。这时，我想她一定是一个人回宾馆去了吧。我就沿着我们来时的路，爬进了山谷。我的膝盖钻心地疼，我还把唆麻给弄丢了。路上花了我好几个小时。午夜之后，我才回到了宾馆。她没在宾馆，没在那里。”主任重复了一遍，陷入了沉默，“唉，”终于，他又接着说开了，“第二天，我们去找她，还是找不到。她一定是掉进某个山沟了，或者被山狮给吃掉了。福帝才晓得。总之，很恐怖。当时这事搅得我很不安，我可以说，超出了正常的程度，因为，毕竟，这种事故可能会发生在任何人身上。当然，虽然社会的组成细胞会发生变化，但社会肌体照样继续存在。”可是，这个睡眠教育的安慰现在似乎不太奏效，他摇摇头，“我有时做梦都会梦见这件事，”主任的声音很低，“梦到自己被阵阵雷声惊醒后，发现她不见了，梦到自己在树丛下找她，找啊，找啊。”他沉默了，陷入回忆。

“您当时一定吓坏了。”伯纳德说，真有点羡慕他了。

听见这个声音，主任突然意识到自己身在何处，有点不好意思。他飞快地瞟了一眼伯纳德，躲着他的眼睛，脸涨得通红，对他突然产生了疑心，又瞥了他一眼，然后，为了维护自己的尊严，他生气地说：“不要以为我和那个女孩的关系有什么不合规矩的，没有什么强烈的感情，没有长时间的纠缠，一切都非常健康，完全正常。”他把许可证递给伯纳德，“我真不明白，为什么要对你讲这些鸡毛蒜皮的往事，让你都烦了。”他因为不小心暴露了一个不太光彩的秘密，很生自己的气，就把气撒在伯纳德身上。他眼睛里流露出丝毫不加掩饰的敌意。“我希望借这个机会，马克斯先生，”他接着说，“告诉你，我对那些有关你工作时间之外言行举止的报告一点都不满意。你可能会说，那不关我的事。但那关乎我的事。我需要考虑我们中心的名声。我的员工们都必须是毋庸置疑的，尤其是那些高种姓的员工。阿尔法们经过了特殊训练，他们在情感行为方面可以不用那么幼稚，但是，正因为如此，他们必须做出特别的努力，才能恪守习俗。幼稚是他们的责任，即使不愿意也得如此。那么，马克斯先生，我可是给过你警告了。”主任的声音因愤慨而颤抖，现在，这愤慨变得更加正气凛然，更加无私，似乎是社会本身在表达着反对，“如果我再听说你有什么违背礼仪、不合幼稚标准的行为，我就把你调到某个分中心去，最好是冰岛。上午好。”他在转椅上一转，拿起笔，开始写东西。

“这就够给他个教训的。”他心里想。但是，他想错了，因为伯纳德大摇大摆地离开了房间，把门砰地关在身后。想到自己单枪匹马地与现有秩序作战，他得意非凡；意识到自己个人的重要性，他不禁为之陶醉，扬扬自得。即使想到有可能受到迫害，他也一点没有感到沮丧。受到迫害的念头不但没有让他感到郁闷，反而更提起了他的劲头。他感到自己足够坚强，完全可以应对并克服任何烦恼，甚至可以面对受贬到冰岛的境遇。况且，他一刻也没有认为自己真的会面对这一切，所以，他的信心益发地足了。人们才不会因为这类事情被调走呢。冰岛只不过是个威胁罢了，一个非常刺激的、让人神清气爽的威胁。走在过道上时，他甚至吹起了口哨。

那天晚上，他讲起自己与孵化与条件训练中心主任的会面时，把自己描述得颇有英雄气概。“因此呢，”他的讲述这样结尾，“我就告诉他，见你的鬼去吧，然后大步走出房间。就这样了。”他充满期待地看着赫尔姆霍茨·华生，等待着自己应得的那份奖赏——同情、鼓励和敬佩。可是，一个字都没有。赫尔姆霍茨沉默地坐在那里，盯着地面。

他很喜欢伯纳德，也很感激他，因为伯纳德是自己熟人中唯一的一个，可以与之探讨自己觉得很重要的那些话题。可是，伯纳德身上有某些方面是他讨厌的，比如，这种自夸，还有与自夸交替出现的卑贱的自我怜悯，还有他那可悲的、事后逞英雄的习惯，以及事不临头时才显摆机智和从容的毛病。他讨厌这些毛病，正因为他喜欢伯纳德才讨厌这些毛病。时间一分一秒过去了，赫尔姆霍茨还在盯着地面。突然，伯纳德脸红了，转过脸去。





3


他们的旅程非常顺利。“蓝色太平洋”号火箭提前两分半钟到达新奥尔良，因为龙卷风，在得克萨斯上空耽误了四分钟，但在西经95度时遇到了顺风的气流，所以，降落到圣菲时，他们比预定时间只晚了四十秒。

“六个半小时的飞行只晚了四十秒，不错。”列宁娜承认。

当晚，他们在圣菲过夜。宾馆条件优越，比那个可怕的北极光之宫不知道强多少倍，去年夏天，列宁娜在那里吃过不少苦头。这里，有液态空气、电视机、振动真空按摩机，有收音机、滚烫的咖啡因饮料，有热乎乎的避孕套，每间卧室里还有八种不同气味的香水。他们走入大厅时，合成音乐正在播放，总之，一切都尽善尽美。电梯里的公告上写着，宾馆里有六十个升降机壁球场，花园里既可以玩障碍高尔夫，也可以玩电磁高尔夫。

“听起来简直太妙了。”列宁娜喊道，“我简直希望我们能够一直待在这里。六十个升降机壁球场……”

“保留地可什么都没有，”伯纳德警告她，“没有香水，没有电视，甚至都没有热水。如果你觉得受不了，你就待在这里，等我回来。”

列宁娜很生气。“我当然受得了。我刚才说这里很妙是因为……因为进步是美妙的，难道不是吗？”

“从十三岁到十七岁，每周一次，每次重复五百遍。”伯纳德厌倦地说，好像在自言自语。

“你说什么？”

“我说，进步是美妙的。正因为如此，如果你不是真的想去保留地，你就不必去了。”

“可我想去。”

“那好吧。”伯纳德说，几乎像在威胁她。

他们的许可证需要保留地总监督的签字，所以，第二天他们就来到总监的办公室。一个艾普西隆＋的黑人看门人接过伯纳德的名片，他们立即就被请了进去。

总监是个金色头发、白色皮肤的阿尔法－，个子不高，红润的满月形圆脸，肩膀宽阔，说话声音浑厚有力。他很擅长引用睡眠教育中的警句。他就像一座装满无关紧要的信息的矿山，总是不请自来地给人提出各种建议。一旦打开话匣子，他总是不停地说啊说，浑厚的声音嗡呀嗡的：

“……五十六万平方公里，划分为四个独立的保留区，每个保留区外面都围着高压电线。”

这时，毫无理由地，伯纳德突然想起自己卫生间里的古龙水龙头还大开着，香水还在不断地流淌。

“……由大峡谷水电站提供电力。”

“等我回去的时候，恐怕得花一大笔钱了。”伯纳德脑海里浮现出缓慢爬动的香水表指针，一圈又一圈，像只蚂蚁一样，毫不疲倦地爬着。“得赶快给赫尔姆霍茨·华生打个电话。”

“……长达五千公里的电网，电压为六万伏特。”

“不会吧。”列宁娜客气地应和着，虽然她根本听不懂总监在说些什么，但她根据他富有戏剧性的停顿做出反应。当总监刚开始嗡呀嗡时，她悄悄地吞下了半克唆麻，结果呢，现在她可以安静地坐在那儿，没有听他讲，脑子也一动未动，只有她那双蓝色的大眼睛聚精会神地盯着总监的脸。

“碰到电网就意味着死亡，”总监严肃地宣告，“没人能从野蛮人保留地逃出去。”

“逃”这个字给了伯纳德暗示。“也许，”他欠了欠身子，“我们该走了。”小小的黑色指针匆匆地前行着，像个虫子，啮食着时间，吞噬着他的金钱。

“根本逃不掉。”总监重复道，挥挥手让他坐回到椅子上。由于许可证还没有签字，伯纳德别无选择，只好服从。“那些出生在保留地的人们，记住，我亲爱的姑娘，”他补充道，色眯眯地看了一眼列宁娜，接着以不太正常的低声说，“记住，在保留地，孩子们还是生出来的，是的，生出来的，虽然听起来挺让人恶心的……”（他以为讲到这个猥亵的话题，列宁娜一定会脸红，谁知她仅仅故作聪明地笑了笑说：“真的吗？”总监失望了，只好接着说）“那些，我再说一遍，那些出生在保留地的人注定也要死在保留地。”

注定要死……每分钟流出一分升的古龙水，每小时六升。“也许，”伯纳德又一次想站起来，“我们该……”

总监身体前倾，用食指敲打着桌面。“你问我有多少人生活在保留地，那么我告诉你，”他得意地说，“我告诉你，我们不知道，只能猜测。”

“真的吗？”

“我亲爱的姑娘，是真的。”

六升乘以二十四小时，不，都快要到六乘以三十六小时了。伯纳德脸都白了，着急得发抖。可是，那无情的嗡嗡声还在继续。

“……大约六万印第安人和混血儿……完完全全的野蛮人……我们的视察官有时会去访问……除此之外，和文明世界几乎是完全隔绝的……还保留着他们那些令人厌恶的风俗习惯……婚姻，如果你知道那是怎么回事的话，我亲爱的姑娘；家庭……没有受过条件训练……可怕的迷信……基督教啊，图腾啊，祖先崇拜等等……消亡了的语言，比如祖尼语、西班牙语、阿萨巴斯卡语……美洲狮、箭猪和其他凶猛动物……传染病……教士……有毒的蜥蜴……”

“真的吗？”

他们终于离开了。伯纳德冲向电话亭。快点，快点，但是，他还是花了快三分钟才接通赫尔姆霍茨·华生的电话。“我们好像现在就已经身处野蛮人中间了，”他抱怨道，“效率太他妈低了。”

“吃一克唆麻。”列宁娜建议。

他拒绝了，他宁可自己生气。终于，感谢福帝，电话通了，是的，是赫尔姆霍茨。他向赫尔姆霍兹解释了发生的事，后者答应立刻去伯纳德的房间，立刻去关掉香水龙头，但还是利用这个机会告诉伯纳德，孵化与条件训练中心主任昨天晚上在公开场合说……“什么？他说要找一个人替换我？”伯纳德的声音很痛苦，“那么，已经最后定下来了？他有没有提到冰岛？你说他提到了？福帝呀！冰岛……”他挂了电话，转过身来，看着列宁娜。他脸色苍白，表情极度沮丧。

“出什么事了？”她问。

“什么事？”他重重地跌坐在椅子上，“我要被派到冰岛去了。”过去，他常常会想，如果他被迫需要经受某种严峻的考验，某种痛苦，某种迫害，那会是什么样子（不靠唆麻，只靠他自己内在的才智）；他渴望受苦。就在一周之前，在主任的办公室，他还想象着自己如何英勇地抵抗，如何坚忍地、默默地接受苦难。实际上，主任当时的威胁反而让他得意扬扬，让他感觉自己比实际上更伟大。可是，现在他意识到，那是因为他没有把那些威胁太当一回事，他觉得，当事情真发展到那一步的时候，主任不会真的那么做。现在，那些威胁似乎真的要兑现了，伯纳德吓坏了。那些想象中的隐忍、理论上的勇气，都跑到九霄云外去了。

他特别生自己的气——你这个大傻瓜！居然和主任对着干——可是，主任不给他再一次机会，太不公平了，现在他确信，自己其实一直都想要再一次机会。可现在，冰岛，冰岛……

列宁娜摇摇头。“过去和未来让我头痛，”她在引用，“我吃唆麻，活在当下。”

最后，她说服他吃下了四片唆麻。五分钟后，事情的起因和后果就都消失了，只剩当下的花朵红彤彤地盛开着。看门人送来消息，说遵照总监的命令，保留地的一个警卫开着飞机过来了，正在宾馆楼顶上等他们。他们立刻上到楼顶。一个穿着绿色衣服、有八分之一黑人血统的伽马对他们敬了个礼，然后给他们介绍了上午的安排。

首先，从空中鸟瞰十一二个主要的印第安村庄，然后降落到玛尔帕斯山谷里吃午餐。那里的宾馆非常舒服，山上的村庄里，野蛮人很可能正在庆祝他们的夏令节日。那里是过夜的好地方。

他们坐上飞机，出发了。十分钟之后，他们就跨越了文明与野蛮的边界。上山，下山，越过盐碱地与沙漠，穿过森林，进入大峡谷紫罗兰色的深谷，飞过岩石、山峰以及平坦如桌面的山顶，高压电网依然向前延伸，延伸，一条无可抗拒的笔直的电线，象征着人类意志胜利的几何形状。在高压线下面，星星点点的，会有一小堆一小堆的白骨，尚未腐烂的尸骨散布在黄褐色的地面上，那是鹿啊，公牛啊，美洲狮啊，箭猪啊，郊狼啊，或者贪婪的土耳其秃鹫什么的，受到一丝腐肉气味的诱惑，来到这里，结果离毁灭一切的高压线太近了，给电死了，就像遭到了报应一般。

“它们总是不长记性。”穿着绿色制服的飞行员说，向下指着地面上的堆堆白骨。“它们永远也记不住。”他补充道，哈哈大笑，好像是他自己战胜了那些被电死的动物。伯纳德也笑了，吃了两克唆麻后，这个笑话不知怎么听起来挺好笑。笑过之后，他几乎马上就睡着了。在睡梦中，他们飞过了陶斯和特苏克，飞过了那姆布、皮库里斯和珀卓克，飞过了斯亚和科奇蒂，飞过了拉古那、阿科马和神秘的平顶山，飞过了祖尼、西伯拉和奥佐卡连特。等伯纳德醒来时，他发现飞机已经停在地面上，列宁娜正提着行李箱往一栋方形的小房子走去，那个有黑人血统的绿衣伽马正在和一个年轻的印第安人说着什么他听不懂的话。

“玛尔帕斯到了，”伯纳德走出飞机时，飞行员对他解释，“这是宾馆。今天下午村庄里有舞会。他会带你们去。”他指了指那个闷闷不乐的年轻野蛮人。“会很好玩的，我想，”他咧嘴一笑，“他们做的每件事都很好玩。”说完，他爬进飞机，发动了引擎。“明天回来。记住，”他补充道，好像在安慰列宁娜，“他们都很温顺，野蛮人不会伤害你的。他们都吃过太多的瓦斯炸弹了，知道不能玩什么花招。”他哈哈大笑着，将直升机的螺旋桨推入挡位，加速，很快消失不见了。





第七章


这座平顶高山就像一艘轮船，停靠在黄褐色尘土的海峡之中。峡谷蜿蜒曲折地在两岸陡峭的悬崖之间延伸着。峭壁之间的山谷里，斜斜地流淌着一抹绿色，那是河流及其两岸的耕地。在海峡中间，在岩石轮船的船头，伸出一片形状规则的几何形的裸露崖壁，和船头连为一体，在这块大崖壁上面就坐落着玛尔帕斯村。高高的房屋耸然直立，一栋上面还有一栋，每一层都比下面的一层小一些，如同层层叠叠被削去角的金字塔，直入云霄。在这些高房子的下面，散落着一些低矮的建筑以及纵横交错的墙壁。房子的三面都是峭壁，直落到平地。几缕炊烟笔直地升入无风的天空，渐渐散去。

“奇怪，”列宁娜说，“真奇怪。”这是她平时表达不满的一贯用语，“我不喜欢这里。我也不喜欢那个人。”她指着那个受指派带他们去村庄的印第安向导。很明显，她的感觉得到了回应，因为，那个走在他们前面的男人，他的后背都在表达着敌意、愠怒和鄙视。

“并且，”她压低声音，“他身上有味儿。”

伯纳德没有试图否认这一点。他们继续向前走着。

突然，好像全部空气都活跃了起来，如同脉搏里的血液，不知疲倦地搏动着，搏动着。来到上面，到了玛尔帕斯村，有人在敲鼓。他们的脚步踏上了那个神秘心脏的节拍，他们加快了脚步。这条路一直把他们带到悬崖的脚下。巨大的平顶山石船的船身高高地矗立在他们上方，船舷离他们有三百英尺。

“真希望我们是开了飞机过来的。”列宁娜说，恨恨地仰头看着峭壁上秃秃的崖面，“我不喜欢走路，而且，当你站在山脚下，会觉得自己非常渺小。”

他们在平顶高山的阴影里走了一段路，绕过一个突岩，之后，他们看到，在一个被崖水浸渍的小山谷中，有一个登山扶梯。他们开始向上爬。路非常陡，呈之字形，从山谷往上延伸。时而，鼓点几乎都听不见了，时而，鼓点似乎就在拐角不远处敲打着。

他们爬到一半的时候，一只苍鹰飞过来，飞得特别近，翅膀扇起的风吹到他们脸上，冷飕飕的。在岩石的缝隙里，躺着一堆白骨。这一切都是那么怪异，令人压抑，而那个印第安人身上的怪味越来越浓了。他们终于走出山谷，走入阳光。平平的山顶犹如石船的甲板。

“就像查令T字塔。”列宁娜评论道。但是，她可没有多少时间来享受她发现的这个给自己带来安慰的相似之处。听到一阵噼啪噼啪的脚步声，他们转过身来。两个印第安人沿着小路跑过来了，他们从喉咙到肚脐完全赤裸，暗褐色的身体上涂着白色的道道（“像是沥青的网球场。”列宁娜后来解释道），他们的脸上涂着一块一块的猩红色、黑色和黄褐色，没有人样。他们黑色的发辫里编织着狐狸毛和红色的法兰绒线，火鸡羽毛做的披肩在肩膀后面飘动着，脑袋上围着耀眼的巨大羽毛王冠。他们每走一步，身上的银手镯、骨头和绿松石珠子做的沉重项链就发出丁零当啷的声音。他们一声不响地跑着，鹿皮靴踩在地上没有一丁点声响。其中一个人拿着一把羽毛刷子，另一个人双手拿着三四条从远处看像是粗绳的东西。其中一条绳子不安地扭曲着，突然，列宁娜看清了，那些都是蛇。

那两个人越来越近了，他们黑黑的眼睛看着她，却没有一丝认出她的迹象，一点都显不出看到她或者意识到她存在的样子。扭动的蛇和其他几条一样，又无力地耷拉下去了。那两个人跑过去了。

“我不喜欢这里，”列宁娜说，“我不喜欢。”

等她来到村口，看到等待她的都有些什么东西之后，她就更不喜欢了。在村口，那个向导丢下他们，到村里去领受指示了。首先，是污泥、成堆的垃圾、灰尘、狗和苍蝇。她厌恶得脸皱成一团，用手绢掩着鼻子。

“他们怎么能这样生活呢？”她愤慨地叫出来，觉得难以置信。（这绝不可能。）

伯纳德颇为理性地耸了耸肩。“无论如何，”他说，“他们这样生活已经有五六千年了。所以，我想他们肯定早就习惯了。”

“可是，清洁卫生近乎神圣啊。”她坚持着。

“是啊，文明等于消毒杀菌。”伯纳德继续说，以讥讽的语气总结了睡眠教育课中基础卫生学的第二条，“可是，这些人从来没有听说过福帝，他们不是文明人。所以，没有必要……”

“哦！”她抓住他的胳膊，“看。”

附近的一所房子那里，一个几乎全身赤裸的印第安人正缓慢地沿扶梯从二楼平台向下爬，一级接一级，因为太老了，动作颤巍巍的，格外谨慎。他的脸皱巴巴、黑乎乎的，像是黑曜石做的面具。没有牙的嘴瘪了进去。他的嘴角和下巴两侧各长了几根长长的胡子，在黝黑皮肤的映衬下，闪着几乎是白色的光。没有编辫子的灰色长发一绺一绺地披散在脸的周围。他佝偻着身体，瘦骨嶙峋，几乎没有一点肉。他缓慢地向下爬着，每爬完一级都要停一会儿，才敢再往下爬一步。

“他怎么了？”列宁娜小声说，惊恐地大睁着眼睛。

“他老了，仅此而已。”伯纳德尽量满不在乎地回答。他自己也吓了一跳，但他尽力显得不为所动。

“老了？”她重复了一遍，“可是，主任也老了，很多人都老了。他们可不是这样的。”

“那是因为我们不让他们老成这样。我们保护他们不受疾病的侵袭。我们人为地让他们的内分泌保持年轻时的平衡。我们不允许他们的镁-钙比值低于他们三十岁时的水准。我们经常给他们输入年轻的血液。我们不断地刺激着他们的新陈代谢。所以，当然啦，他们看起来就不会是这个样子。还有部分原因是，”他补充道，“大多数人达不到这个老家伙的年龄就死了。年轻的状态毫发无损地持续到六十岁，然后，咔嚓，死了。”

可是，列宁娜没有听进去。她还在看着那个老头。他慢慢地、慢慢地下来了，他的脚碰到地面了。他转过身来。在他深陷的眼窝里，一双眼睛依然异常明亮。那双眼睛毫无表情地看着她，丝毫没有显出惊讶的神色，好像她并没有在那里一样。然后，慢慢地，驼着背，那个老头蹒跚地走过他们身边，不见了。

“这太可怕了，”列宁娜悄悄说，“太糟糕了。我们不应该来这儿。”她摸摸口袋，想找唆麻，可是，她却发现，由于她前所未有的疏忽，她竟然把装唆麻的瓶子落在宾馆了。伯纳德的口袋也是空的。

列宁娜只好孤立无助地去面对玛尔帕斯村的种种恐怖之处了。这些恐怖接踵而至，迅速向她袭来。两个年轻妇女给孩子喂奶的场景让她羞红了脸，她赶紧转过脸去。她从来没有见过这么猥亵的事情，更糟的是，伯纳德不仅没有巧妙地对此置之不理，反而开始堂而皇之地对这种令人作呕的胎生繁殖现象评头论足起来。现在，唆麻的药效已经过去，他对自己当天早晨在宾馆里的软弱表现感到羞耻，所以，他不遗余力地想要证明自己的坚强和不落俗套。

“多么美妙亲密的关系，”他说，故意表现得很反常，“这一定会产生十分强烈的感情啊！我常想，没有妈妈，我们也许缺失了点什么东西。列宁娜，也许因为成不了一个妈妈，你也失去了什么东西呢。想象一下吧，你坐在这里，抱着一个你自己的婴儿……”

“伯纳德！你怎么能这么说话？”一个患结膜炎和皮肤病的老年妇女经过，让列宁娜忘记了自己的愤慨。

“我们走吧，”她乞求着，“我不喜欢这里。”

但就在这时候，他们的向导回来了，招手让他们跟着他，然后领着他们沿两排房屋中间的狭窄街道向前走去。他们绕过一个拐角。一条死狗躺在垃圾堆上，一个长着瘤子的女人正扒拉着一个小女孩的头发捉虱子。他们的向导停在一把梯子脚下，把手笔直地举起来，然后又平着向前伸了伸。他们领会了他一声不响的动作，爬上梯子，梯子通向一个门口，这时，他们走进了一个狭长的房间，非常昏暗，充斥着烟味、烹炒过的油味以及穿了很长时间不洗的衣服气味。房间的尽头还有一扇门，从那里射过来一线阳光，传来响亮的鼓声，声音很近。

他们迈过门槛，来到一个宽阔的平台。在他们脚下，被高房子围住的，就是村庄的广场，挤满了印第安人。鲜艳的毛毯，黑发上装饰的羽毛，闪光的绿松石，热得发亮的黑皮肤。列宁娜再次用手绢掩住了鼻子。广场中间的空地上，有两个圆形的台子，由石头和黏土碾压平整而成，很显然，这是地下室的屋顶。在每个台子的中间都有一个旋梯口，一把梯子从下面的黑暗中伸出。有笛声从地下传来，几乎淹没在持续敲打着的鼓声里。

列宁娜喜欢鼓声。她闭上眼睛，任由那打雷般的轻柔节奏左右着自己，让鼓声完完全全地侵入自己的意识深处，直到世界万物都消失了，只剩下这深沉的脉搏跳动般的声音。这声音让她想起团结礼拜仪式和福帝日庆祝活动上的合成音乐，带给她一丝慰藉。“狂欢啊。”她悄悄地说，这鼓声敲出的是一模一样的节奏。

蓦地，一阵歌声传来，几百个男声撕心裂肺般地大声唱着，那是刺耳的金属一般的合唱。几声长音之后，便归于沉寂，剩下雷鸣般的鼓声；紧接着，女人们做出了回应，唱着马嘶般的尖厉高音，然后，又只剩下鼓声；再一次，男声发出深沉野蛮的回应，宣告着自己的男子气概。

真奇怪，是的。这个地方真奇怪，音乐奇怪，他们的服装打扮、皮肤病、老年人，也都很奇怪。可是，这个表演，却没有什么特别奇怪之处。

“让我想起了低种姓人的社会歌曲演唱。”她告诉伯纳德。

过了一会儿，这里的表演就不会让她再想起社区歌曲演唱那种无害的表演了。突然，从地下的圆房间里涌出一大群狰狞的怪物。他们或者戴着丑陋的面具，或者脸涂得都已不再像人脸，开始围着广场跳一种奇怪的瘸腿舞，一圈又一圈，边跳边唱，一圈又一圈，一次更比一次快。鼓点节奏变了，变得更快，听起来像发烧时的脉搏跳动。人群也开始跟着跳舞者唱起歌来，歌声越来越响。有个女人尖叫起来，接着是第二个、第三个，好像有人要杀她们一样。然后，跳舞者中的那个领头人从队伍中跑出来，跑到广场远处的一个大木箱子那里，打开箱盖，拽出两条黑色的大蛇。人群爆发出一阵欢呼，其他跳舞者都跑向他，双手向前伸着。他将蛇扔给最前面的人，然后伸手到箱子里去拿更多的蛇出来。越来越多的蛇，黑色的、棕色的、斑点的，他全都扔了出去。舞蹈再次开始，这次换了一个不同的节奏。他们举着蛇，一圈接一圈地转着，他们的膝盖和胯骨柔软地扭动着，像蛇一样，一圈又一圈。接着，领头人做了个手势，那些蛇被一条一条地扔到了广场的中间，一个老人从地下走上来，把玉米片撒在蛇堆上面，一个女人从另一个旋梯口上来，从黑坛子里舀水洒到蛇堆上面。老人举起手，周围突然陷入死一般的沉寂，令人吃惊、叫人害怕的沉寂。鼓声停止了，生命似乎终结了。老人指着通向地下世界的两个楼梯口。慢慢地，被下面看不见的手举着，一只苍鹰的画像伸了出来，从另一个开口，一个男人的画像出来了，他裸露的身体被钉在一个十字架上。两幅画像悬停在那里，似乎在靠自身的力量支撑着，观看着周围的一切。老人拍了拍手。一个大约十八岁的少年从人群中走出来，身体赤裸，仅在腰间围了一块白棉布。他站在老人面前，双手交叉放在胸前，低着头。老人在他头上划了个十字，走开了。这个少年开始围着扭动的蛇堆慢慢地转圈子，他转完了第一圈，第二圈刚刚转到一半，从跳舞的人群里走出一个高个男人，戴着郊狼的面具，手上拿着由皮绳编织而成的鞭子，走向少年。少年继续绕着圈子，似乎没有意识到这个男人的存在。戴郊狼面具的男人举起鞭子，似乎等待了许久，然后鞭子突然下甩，啪的一声鞭响，鞭梢响亮地落在肉身上。少年的身体抖了一下，但他没有吭气，继续平稳缓慢地走着。郊狼再次举鞭，一次，两次，他每一次鞭打，人群都先是倒抽一口气，然后发出低低的呻吟声。少年还在走着，两圈，三圈，四圈。血流了下来。五圈，六圈。突然，列宁娜用手捂住脸，开始哭泣。“哦，阻止他们，阻止他们！”她央求道。但是，皮鞭无情地一次次下落。七圈。突然，少年步子踉跄了一下，还是一声不响，脸朝下栽倒在地。那个老人伏在他身上，拿一根长长的白羽毛蘸蘸他的后背，拿起了羽毛，深红色的，他举了一会儿，展示给人们看，然后，他手举羽毛在蛇堆上面晃了三下。几滴鲜血落了下来，突然，鼓声再次响起，节奏飞快，像是在惊慌地逃跑，人们大喊起来。跳舞者跑向前，捡起蛇，跑出了广场。男人、女人、孩童，人群都跟着跑掉了。一分钟之后，广场变得空空荡荡，只有那个少年留在那里，趴在他栽倒的地方，一动不动。三个老年妇女从一所房子里走出来，艰难地托起他，抬走了。有一阵子，只剩下苍鹰和十字架上的男人守卫着空旷的村落。过了一会儿，他们好像也看够了，慢慢地从旋梯口降下去，进入地下的世界，不见了。

列宁娜还在哭泣。“太可怕了，”她不断地说，伯纳德的安慰也毫无效果，“太可怕了！流了那么多的血！”她浑身发抖，“哦，我真希望带了我的唆麻！”

里面的房间传来了脚步声。

列宁娜没有动，用手捂着脸，坐在一边，什么都没有看见。伯纳德转过身。

现在走到平台的那个年轻人穿着印第安人的服装，可是他编成辫子的头发却是浅黄色的，眼睛是淡蓝色的，皮肤则是白皮肤，晒成了青铜色。

“嗨，日安。”这个陌生人说，他的英语无可挑剔，但听着有点奇怪，“你们是文明人，是吧？你们是从‘那个地方’来的，从保留地外面来的？”

“你究竟是……”伯纳德吃惊地说。

年轻人叹了口气，摇摇头。“一个非常不快乐的绅士。”他指着广场中央的血迹，“你们看见那块可恶的血斑(1)了吗？”他问话的声音因为激动而颤抖。

“唆麻一片，摆脱苦难。”列宁娜从捂着脸的双手背后机械地说，“我真希望带了我的唆麻！”

“在那里的应该是我，”年轻人接着说，“他们为什么不让我做这个牺牲？我本可以走十圈，十二圈，十五圈。帕罗提瓦才走了七圈。他们可以从我身体中得到两倍的血，将一望无垠的大海染成殷红(2)。”他以夸张的手势张开双臂，随即又绝望地放下，“可他们不让我去。他们因为我的肤色而讨厌我。一直是这样，一直。”泪水涌入年轻人的双眼，他感到不好意思了，转过身去。

列宁娜吃惊地忘记了没有唆麻这回事。她把双手从脸上拿开，第一次去看这个陌生人。“你是说，你想让人用鞭子打你？”

年轻人的脸还背对着她，但他用手势做了个肯定的回答。“为了村庄的利益，为了求雨，为了让庄稼生长。为了取悦菩公(3)和耶稣。同时，还能证明我能忍受痛苦，不哭不叫。是的，”他的声音突然变得洪亮起来，他骄傲地挺起了胸，自豪地、挑战似的抬起下巴，转过身来，“为了证明我是个男人……啊！”他倒抽了一口气，沉默了，嘴巴张着。生命中第一次，他看见了这样一张女孩的脸，这张脸的双颊既不是巧克力色也不是狗皮色，她的头发是红褐色的，永久地卷曲着，她的表情（奇怪，新奇！）既善良又充满兴趣。列宁娜对他微笑着，多么好看的小伙子，她在想，身材真漂亮。血液一下子涌上年轻人的脸，他垂下眼睛，一会儿又抬了起来，看到她还在对着自己微笑，他异常慌乱，只得赶忙转过身，假装认真地看着广场另一头的某个东西。

伯纳德的问题岔开了他的注意力。谁？怎么回事？什么时候？从哪里来的？年轻人盯着伯纳德的脸（他迫切地想看看列宁娜对他微笑的脸，可他就是不敢看她），试图解释自己的情况。他和琳达——琳达是他的妈妈（这个词让列宁娜感到非常不舒服）——是这个保留地的外来者。琳达是很久以前从“那个地方”来的，在他出生之前，和一个男人一起来的，那个男人就是他的爸爸。（伯纳德把耳朵竖了起来。）她独自一人去北边的山那边散步，摔到一个峭壁下面，伤了头部。（“往下说，往下说。”伯纳德激动地说。）从玛尔帕斯来的一些猎人发现了她，把她带回村庄。至于那个男人，他的爸爸，琳达此后再也没有见过他。他叫托马金。（是的，孵化与条件训练中心主任的名字就是托马斯。）他肯定是飞走了，飞回到“那个地方”，把她给扔下了。那可真是个狠心肠、不近人情的坏蛋。

“这样，我就出生在了玛尔帕斯，”他结束了他的话，“玛尔帕斯。”他摇摇头。村庄外面那个肮脏的小房子！




一块满是灰尘和垃圾的空地将小房子与村庄隔开。两只饿得瘦骨嶙峋的狗正在门口的垃圾里嗅着，拱着，真让人恶心。他们走进房子，里面光线昏暗，气味难闻，苍蝇嗡嗡地叫着。

“琳达！”年轻人叫道。

“来了。”从里屋传来一个非常沙哑的女声。

他们等待着。地板上的几个碗里盛着剩饭剩菜，很可能是好几顿吃剩的。

门开了。一个非常粗壮、金发碧眼的印第安女人迈过门槛，停住了，难以置信地盯着他们，嘴巴张得大大的。列宁娜注意到她缺了两颗门牙，而那些还没掉的牙的颜色……她厌恶地打了个激灵。看着比那个老头还要糟糕。那么胖。她脸上那么多的褶子，皮肤松弛，皱纹横生，凹陷的两颊上面还长着紫斑。鼻子上那些红红的血管，那双充血的眼睛，还有那脖子，哦，那个脖子。她头上围着的毛毡又脏又破，身上穿的宽松上衣像个棕色的大麻袋，巨大的乳房，突出的肚子，还有那个大屁股。哦，比那个老头还要糟糕，糟糕得多！突然，那个人语速飞快地说起话来，伸着双臂向她冲过来，福帝！福帝！太恶心了，再过一会儿，她都要吐了。她紧紧地抱住她，她那肚子，乳房紧贴着，还开始亲吻她。福帝！亲吻，口水横流的亲吻，难闻的体味儿，显然从来没有洗过澡，闻起来就像放入德尔塔和艾普西隆瓶子的那种恶心的东西（哦，关于伯纳德的传言不会是真的），这才是酒气熏天的臭味。她尽可能快速地从她的怀抱中挣脱开来。

面前是一张哭得变了形的脸，那个人在哭。

“哦，亲爱的，我亲爱的，”她一边哽咽着，滔滔的话语同时倾泻出来，“但愿你知道我有多高兴，这么多年过去了！一张文明人的脸。是啊，还有文明人的衣服。我本以为我再也见不到一块真正的人造丝了呢。”她摸摸列宁娜衬衣的袖子，她的指甲黑乎乎的，“还有这可爱的黏胶天鹅绒的短裤。你知道吗，亲爱的，我的旧衣服还留着呢，我来的时候穿的衣服，收在一个盒子里，回头我给你看看。不过，人造丝上都是破洞了。还有一条可爱的白腰带，必须承认，你的这条绿色代摩洛哥皮革的更好看。我的那条腰带也没有给我带来什么好处。”她又开始哗哗流泪，“我想约翰都告诉你们了吧，我吃的那些苦。连一克唆麻都没有。偶尔才能喝上点波培带给我的麦斯卡尔酒。波培是个我认识的男孩。可是，喝完之后，让你感觉格外难受，麦斯卡尔酒就是这样，可喝拍约他酒又很恶心，况且喝完拍约他酒，第二天你总会觉得自己的羞耻感更严重了，很可怕。我本来就觉得很羞耻。想想吧，我，一个贝塔，却生了个孩子，设身处地想想吧。”（仅仅提了这一句就让列宁娜一阵战栗。）“尽管这不是我的错，我发誓不是，因为至今我也不知道是怎么发生的，我做了所有那些马尔萨斯操。你知道的，数着数做的那些，一，二，三，四。我每次都做，我发誓。可是，这还是发生了，当然，这里没有那种堕胎中心。顺便问一下，它还是在切尔西吗？”她问。列宁娜点点头。“周二和周五，大楼还是全部照亮吗？”列宁娜再次点点头。“那座可爱的粉色玻璃塔！”可怜的琳达仰起脸，闭上眼睛，兴奋地回想着那鲜亮的景象。“还有夜晚时分的河流。”她低低地说，大滴大滴的泪珠从她紧闭的眼睑后面缓缓地涌出来，“晚上从斯托克波吉斯飞回来，洗个热水澡，来个真空振动按摩……可是这里……”她深深地吸了一口气，摇摇头，睁开了眼睛，吸了一两次鼻子，用手指擤了擤鼻涕，抹在裙子上，“哦，对不起，”看到列宁娜不由自主的厌恶表情，琳达说，“我不应该这么做。对不起。可是，如果没有手绢，你又该怎么办呢？我还记得，我当时看到这情形有多不安，那么多灰尘，没有什么东西是消过毒的。他们刚把我带回到这里的时候，我的头上有个很大的伤口。你都想象不到他们往伤口上涂些什么东西。脏东西，尽是脏东西。‘文明就是消毒杀菌’，我过去经常跟他们这么说，跟他们说‘链球菌马儿转转，到班伯里T去看看，去看什么？漂亮的浴室和洗手间’，好像他们是孩子一样。可是，他们自然是听不懂的。他们怎么可能听懂呢？最后，我想自己也就习惯了。况且，没有随时可用的热水，你怎么可能保持清洁呢？看看我的这些衣服。这种难看的毛料可不像人造丝。它总也穿不坏。而且，破了之后你还得缝缝补补。我是个贝塔，我过去在受精室工作，没有人教过我如何做这类事情。这根本不是我的事。还有，补衣服是不对的。有了破洞就应该扔掉，然后买新的。‘补丁越多，人越穷。’我记得没错吧！缝补是反社会的行为。可是，这里一切都不同，就像和疯子们生活在一起。他们做的每件事都是疯狂的。”她向四处望望，看到约翰和伯纳德已经离开这里，在房子外面的灰尘和垃圾地里来来回回地散步。但是，她还是密谋似的压低了嗓音，向列宁娜靠了过来，离得那么近，她那带着胚胎毒一样臭味的呼吸吹动了她脸颊上的汗毛，列宁娜身子变得僵硬，往后缩了缩。“比如，”她低声说，声音嘶哑，“他们男女之间的关系。疯狂，我告诉你，完全是疯狂。人人彼此相属，对吧，对吧？”她执意问道，一边还拉扯着列宁娜的衣袖。列宁娜的脸扭着，点点头，呼出了她一直憋着的那口气，又悄悄地吸了一口稍稍好闻点的空气。“唉，在这里，”琳达接着说，“每个人都只能属于一个人。如果你正常地接纳男人，他们会认为你很坏、反社会。他们憎恨你，鄙视你。有一次，一大群女人跑来，大吵大闹，就因为他们的男人来看我。为什么不呢？她们向我冲过来……不讲了，太可怕了，我不能给你讲了。”琳达捂住脸，身子一阵战栗，“他们都太可恨了，这里的女人。疯狂，既疯狂又狠毒。当然，她们不懂什么马尔萨斯操，也不懂什么瓶子啊换瓶啊那类东西。所以，她们不停地怀孩子，生孩子，像狗一样。太恶心了。想想我自己……哦，福帝，福帝，福帝！可是，约翰是我的一大安慰。我不知道如果没有他我该怎么办。虽然每次有男人来……他都很烦恼。他还很小的时候就这样。有一次（他已经长大点了），他想杀了可怜的瓦胡斯瓦，或者也许是波培吧？就是因为我有时和他们在一起。我总也没有办法让他明白，文明人就是应该这么做。疯狂也是会传染的吧，我是这么认为的。反正，约翰好像从印第安人那里染上了疯狂。因为，他自然会经常跟他们在一起。虽然他们对他总是很恶劣，不让他做其他男孩做的事情。在某种程度上，这也许是好事，这样我训练起他来就会容易一些。你不知道那有多困难。有那么多我不知道的事情，我本来也不应该知道那么多事情的。我的意思是，当一个孩子问你，直升机怎么工作，或者谁创造了这个世界，等等，唉，如果你是个在受精室工作的贝塔，你该怎么回答呢？该怎么回答呢？”

第八章


外面，在弥漫的灰尘和垃圾当中（现在已经有四条狗了），伯纳德和约翰来来回回地慢慢走着。

“我很难明白，”伯纳德正在说，“很难想象你的生活。好像我们生活在不同的星球上，生活在不同的时代。一个妈妈，这些灰尘，神祇，老年，以及疾病……”他摇摇头，“几乎难以想象。我永远也不会明白，除非你给我解释解释。”

“解释什么呢？”

“这个，”伯纳德指指村庄，“那个，”指指村庄外的小房子，“一切，你的全部生活。”

“可是，要说些什么呢？”

“从一开始。从你开始记事说起。”

“从我开始记事说起。”约翰的眉头皱到了一起。一阵长长的沉默。




天气很热。他们都吃了不少玉米饼和甜玉米。琳达说：“来，宝贝，躺下。”他们一起躺在大床上。“唱个歌吧，”琳达开始唱，“链球菌马儿转转，到班伯里T去看看”，还有“再见宝贝班廷，很快你就要换瓶”。她的声音越来越弱……

一阵很大的声响，把他惊醒了。一个男人站在床边，显得巨大而又吓人，正在对琳达说些什么，琳达在笑。她把毯子拉到了下巴处，可那个男人又给拽下去了。他的头发像两根粗黑的绳子，胳膊上戴着一个好看的银手镯，上面镶着蓝色的石头。他很喜欢这个手镯，可是，他仍然很害怕，他的脸紧紧靠着琳达的身体。琳达用手揽着他，他感到安全多了。她用他听不太懂的那种话对那个男人说：“不行，约翰在这儿呢。”那个男人看看他，又看看琳达，对琳达温柔地说了点什么。琳达说：“不行。”那个男人却朝着床俯下身，脸对着他，那男人的脸看起来那么大、那么可怕，粗黑的辫子碰到了毯子。“不行。”琳达又说了一遍，他感觉到琳达把他抓得更紧了，“不行，不行！”可是，那个男人抓住了他的一只胳膊，抓得很疼。他大叫起来。男人伸出另一只手，把他抱起来。琳达还在抓着他，还在说“不行，不行”。男人说了句什么，很短促，很生气，她的手突然松开了。“琳达，琳达。”他叫喊着，踢着脚，挣扎着，那个男人却把他抱到门口，打开门，把他放在另一个房间地板上的正中间，然后走了，随后把门关上了。他站起来，跑到门口。他踮起脚尖站着，刚好能够到那个大门栓。他拉开门栓，推了推门，可是打不开。“琳达。”他喊道。她没有回答。




他还记得一个很大的房间，很暗，里面放了一些巨大的木头制品，拴着线，周围站着很多女人——琳达说，在织毯子。琳达让他和其他孩子一起坐到角落里，她去帮那些女人。他和那些小男孩玩了很长时间。突然，人们说话的声音变大了，那些女人正在往外推搡琳达，琳达哭了。她走到门口，他跑过去找她。他问她，为什么那些人生气了。“因为我弄断了东西。”她说，她也突然生气了，“我怎么可能会织这些可恶的东西呢？”她说，“可恶的野蛮人。”他问她，什么是野蛮人。他们回到自己的房子后，波培正等在门口，就和他们一起进来了。他拿来了一个大葫芦，里面装满了水一样的东西，可是，那不是水，而是有怪味的东西，喝了之后呛嗓子，让人咳嗽。琳达喝了一些，波培也喝了一些，然后，琳达就开始不断地傻笑，大声讲话，之后，她和波培一起去了另外一个房间。波培离开后，他走进房间。琳达正躺在床上熟睡，他怎么都叫不醒她。

那时候，波培经常来。他说葫芦里的东西叫作麦斯卡尔酒，但琳达说那应该叫作唆麻，只是，事后这东西让你感到不舒服。他恨波培。他恨所有那些人，恨那些来看琳达的男人。有天下午，他正在和其他孩子一起玩耍，他记得那天很冷，山上还有积雪。他回到房里，听到卧室里传出愤怒的声音。是一些女人的声音，她们说的话他听不懂，但他知道肯定是很难听的话。突然，叭的一声，好像什么东西倒了，他听到人们在跑来跑去，又是叭的一声，之后就是鞭打驴子那种声音，只是挨打的不像驴子那么瘦。琳达尖叫起来。“哦，不要，不要，不要！”她说。他跑进去。是三个披着黑毛毡的女人。琳达在床上。一个女人按住她的手腕，另一个横躺在她的腿上，这样她就不会乱踢了。第三个正在用鞭子抽打她。一下，两下，三下，每一下抽打，琳达都疼得大叫。他哭了，使劲拽那个女人身上的毡子边：“求你了，求你了。”女人用空着的那只手把他推开。鞭子又一次落下来，琳达又叫了一声。他抓住女人棕色的大手，用尽全力咬了下去。她疼得大叫一声，把手挣脱，狠狠地推了他一把，他摔倒在地。他躺在地上的时候，她用鞭子抽了他三下，那疼得比什么都厉害，火烧火燎的。鞭子再次呼啸而下，可是，这次是琳达大叫了一声。

“可是，她们为什么要伤害你呢，琳达？”那天晚上，他问道。他在哭泣，鞭子打在他后背留下的红印还是疼得要命，可是，他之所以哭，是因为人们都太坏、太不公平，他自己还是个孩子，没法还击。琳达也在哭，她是成年人，可是她一个人抵挡不了她们三个。对她来说也不公平。“为什么她们要伤害你，琳达？”

“我不知道，我怎么会知道呢？”很难听清楚她的话，她肚子朝下躺着，脸埋在枕头里，“她们说那些男人是她们的。”她接着说，她根本不像在对他讲话，而是在对自己脑子里的某个人讲话，很长的话，他听不懂的话。最后，她哭的声音更大了。

“哦，琳达，别哭，别哭。”

他把身体靠过去，抱住她的脖子。琳达大叫一声，“啊，小心，我的肩膀！啊！”她把他推开，狠狠地推开。砰，他的头碰到了墙上。“你这个小白痴！”她大喊，突然，她开始扇他的耳光，扇啊，扇……

“琳达，”他喊道，“哦，妈妈，不要！”

“我不是你妈妈，我不想做你妈妈。”

“可是，琳达……啊！”她狠狠地抽在他的脸上。

“变成了个野蛮人，”她大喊道，“像动物一样生孩子……要不是你的话，我可能去找视察官了，可能都离开这里了。可是，带着个孩子。太丢人了！”

他看到她又要打他了，赶紧举起手护着自己的脸。

“哦，琳达，不要，求你了，不要。”

“小畜生！”她把他的胳膊拽下来，他的脸露出来了。

“不要，琳达。”他闭上眼睛，等着挨打。

可是，她没有再打他。过了一会儿，他睁开眼睛，她正在看着他。他试着对她笑。突然，她抱住他，亲他，一次又一次。




有时候，接连几天，琳达都不起床。她躺在床上伤心。或者，她喝波培带给她的那种东西，喝完后一个劲地笑，然后去睡觉。有时，她会生病。她经常忘记给他洗澡，除了冷玉米饼之外，也没有什么吃的。他还记得，她第一次在他头发里面发现那种小虫子的时候，她一阵大呼小叫，好一会儿都停不下来。

*

最快乐的时光就是当她给他讲“那个地方”的时候。“你们真的会飞吗？想飞就飞？”

“想飞就飞。”她会给他讲从盒子里传出来的美妙音乐，所有那些好玩的游戏，美味的食物和饮料，墙上那个按一下就立刻会出现亮光的小东西，还有能够看到、闻到和摸到的图画，制造好闻气味的盒子，像高山一样的粉房子、绿房子、蓝房子和银房子，每个人都快乐幸福，没有人会伤心或生气，人人彼此相属，能让你看到和听到外面世界的匣子，漂亮而干净的瓶子里的婴儿。一切都那么干净，没有难闻的气味，没有一粒灰尘。人们从来不会孤独，而是快活幸福地生活在一起，就像玛尔帕斯夏天的舞会，只是比那舞会还快活，每天都快活，每天……他常常一听就是一小时。有时候，他和其他孩子们玩累了的时候，村庄里的一个老头儿会用他们的那种语言，给他们讲故事，讲世界上的那个伟大的改革者，讲右手与左手的长期战争，讲干燥和湿润之间的战争，讲阿沃纳威娄纳(1)的故事，他仅靠在深夜里思考就创造了大雾，又从大雾中创造了整个世界；讲地母和天父；讲阿海育塔和玛赛莱玛，这对战争和机遇的双胞胎；讲耶稣和菩公，讲玛丽和埃特桑纳托，那个能让自己恢复青春的女人；讲拉古那的黑石头，阿科马的大鹰和圣母。都是奇怪的故事，而且由于是用那种语言讲的，他听不太懂，所以益发显得神奇了。躺在床上的时候，他会想起天堂、伦敦和阿科马圣母，想起一排一排干净瓶子里的婴儿，想起升天的耶稣，想起琳达飞起来的情景，想起高不可攀的世界孵化中心主任，也想起阿沃纳威娄纳。

*

很多男人来看琳达。那些男孩子开始对他指指点点。他们用那种奇怪的语言说琳达是个坏女人，他们用他听不懂的语言骂她，但他知道那是骂人话。有一天，他们编了一首歌来唱她，唱了一遍又一遍。于是，他向他们扔石头，他们也反过来扔他。一块尖利的石头砸破了他的脸颊，血一直流个不停，他满身都是血。




琳达教他认字。她用一个炭块在墙上画图画，一只坐着的动物，瓶子里的一个婴儿，然后，她写上字母：“猫在垫子上，婴儿在瓶子里”。他学得很快，很容易。等他认识了她写在墙上的所有字之后，琳达打开她的大木箱，从那些可笑的、她从没有穿过的红色短裤子下面，拽出一本薄薄的小书。他以前看到过这本书。“等你长大点，”她那时说，“你就会读了。”现在，他已经够大了。他很得意。“恐怕你会觉得这本书很没有意思，”她说，“可是，我只有这一本。”她叹叹气，“要是你能够看到我们伦敦那些可爱的阅读机器就好了！”他开始阅读。《胚胎的化学和细菌学条件设置》，《胚胎库贝塔工作人员实用指南》。他光是读书名，就花了一刻钟。他把书扔到地上。“讨厌，讨厌的书！”他说，然后哭开了。




男孩子们还是唱他们编的那首可怕的琳达之歌。有时，他们也因为他穿得破破烂烂而笑话他。他把衣服弄破以后，琳达不知道怎么补。在“那个地方”，琳达告诉他，衣服有了破洞，人们就会扔掉，买新的。“破烂，破烂！”那些男孩子总是冲着他喊。“可我会读书，”他对自己说，“他们不会，他们连什么是读书都不知道。”每次他们嘲笑他时，如果他努力想着读书的事，假装他并不在乎就容易得多了。他让琳达再把那本书拿给他。

男孩子们越是指指点点，越是嘲笑他，他越是努力读书。很快，他就认识书里所有的词了，连最长的词都会读了。可是，那些是什么意思呢？他问琳达，即使琳达知道，也说不太清楚，而通常情况下，她根本都说不上来。

“什么是化学药品？”他会问。

“哦，就像镁盐啊，让德尔塔和艾普西隆们长得又矮又笨的酒精啊，用于骨头健康的碳酸钙啊，就是那类东西。”

“怎么制造化学药品呢，琳达？化学药品是从哪里来的呢？”

“我也不知道。就是从瓶子里拿出来的。瓶子空了的时候，你就向化学药品库要。我想，是化学药品库的人们制造的吧。或者，是他们向工厂里要的。我不知道。我从来没有做过化学这一行。我的工作是在胚胎库。”

他问的其他问题也是这样，琳达好像总是不知道。村里的老人就有更明确的答案。

“人和各种生物的种子，太阳的种子，大地的种子，天空的种子。都是阿沃纳威娄纳从繁衍之雾里创造出来的。这个世界有四个子宫，他将种子放在最低的子宫里。然后，种子开始慢慢地生长……”

有一天（约翰后来计算，应该是他过了十二岁生日没几天），他回家后发现卧室地上放着一本他从来没有见过的书。这是一本很厚的书，看起来很旧了。书脊被老鼠啃坏了，有些书页已经松了，皱皱巴巴的。他把书捡起来，看了看书名，是《威廉·莎士比亚全集》。

琳达正躺在床上，从杯子里啜饮那种味道难闻的麦斯卡尔酒。“波培拿来的。”她说。她的声音又粗又哑，好像是别人的声音，“放在羚羊穴的一个大箱子里，据说已经放了几百年了。有可能是真的，我看了看，里面全都是些废话。一点也不文明。可是，你用它练习阅读还是挺好的。”她又喝了最后一口，把杯子放在床边的地上，侧过身去，打了一两个嗝，睡着了。

他随便翻开了一页。

哼，生活在一张汗臭冲鼻、

充满油垢的温床里；

只知道在腐堕里翻腾，

在龌龊的猪窝里寻欢做爱。(2)

这些奇怪的字句在他的头脑里翻滚着，轰鸣着，犹如滚滚的雷声，又像夏令舞会的鼓声——如果那些鼓声也会说话；既像那些唱玉米丰收歌的人，歌声那么美，那么美，都把人唱哭了；也像老米斯玛在念咒语，对着他的那些羽毛、雕花的手杖和零零碎碎的骨头啊石头啊什么的念个不停，叽里呱啦，哼哼哈哈，西库瓦，西库瓦，但是又比这个魔咒好听多了，因为这些词句更有意义，它们在对他说话，那么美妙，可惜只能听懂一半。这是既可怕又神秘的魔咒，是关于琳达的，关于琳达躺在那里打着呼噜，床边的地上放着空酒杯，关于琳达和波培的事，琳达和波培。

他越来越恨波培。一个人也许总是满脸堆笑，可他照样是个坏蛋。凶残、无情、狡诈、淫荡的坏蛋。(3)这些词语都是什么意思？他似懂非懂。但是，这些词的魔法很厉害，他的头脑里总是轰隆隆地响着这些词语，并且，现在看来，他好像从来没有真正憎恨过波培，没有真正憎恨过，因为他从来说不清他是如何憎恨波培的。现在，他知道了这些词语，这些像鼓声、像歌声又像咒语的词语。这些词语，以及他从中学会了这些词语的那个奇怪的故事（他根本看不懂，但是，这个故事还是非常棒，非常棒），它们给了他憎恨波培的理由，它们让他的仇恨更真实，它们甚至让波培变得更加真实。

有一天，他从外面玩耍回来，里屋的门开着，他看见他们两个人躺在床上，睡着了，肤色白皙的琳达和她身边黑乎乎的波培。他的一只胳膊伸在琳达的肩膀下面，另一只黑手放在她的乳房上，他的一条长辫子横在她的喉咙上，就像一条正要缠死她的蛇。波培的葫芦和杯子放在床边的地上。琳达在打呼噜。

他的心似乎消失了，留下了一个洞。他感到自己空了，空了，浑身发冷，恶心，头晕。他靠在墙上，让自己站稳。无情、狡诈、淫荡……像鼓点，像玉米丰收时的歌声，像咒语，这些词语在他头脑里一遍又一遍地重复。他从全身冰冷，突然变得浑身燥热。他感到血液上涌，脸颊如同发烧，在他的眼前，房间开始旋转，变暗。他咬着牙。“我要杀了他，我要杀了他，我要杀了他。”他不断地说。突然，他想起了更多的词语：

“当他烂醉如泥、大发雷霆、淫榻寻欢……”(4)

咒语是站在他这一边的，咒语解释了命令，发出了命令。他退回到外屋。“当他烂醉如泥……”切肉的刀放在壁炉旁边的地板上，他把刀捡起来，踮着脚尖，再次走到门口。“当他烂醉如泥，烂醉如泥……”他跑进房间，扎了下去，哦，出血了！再扎一下。看到波培醒了，他举起手准备再扎，却发现自己的手腕被抓住了，攥得紧紧的，哦！手腕给掰过去了。他一动也不能动，他给困住了。波培那双小小的黑眼睛，离得那么近，盯着自己的眼睛。他眼睛望向别处。波培的左肩上有两个伤口。“哦！看看流的这血！”琳达在哭，“看看这血！”她从来都看不得流血。波培举起另外一只手，他以为要打他。他身子挺着，准备迎接这一击。可是，波培的手仅仅攥住他的下巴，把他的脸扭过来，让他不得不看着波培的眼睛。过了好一会儿，好像有好几个小时那么长，突然，他再也受不了，开始大哭起来。波培哈哈大笑，“走开，”他说，说的是印第安语，“走开，我勇敢的阿海育塔。”他跑到另外的房间，把眼泪藏起来。




“你十五岁了。”老米斯玛用印第安语说，“现在，我可以教你做泥塑了。”

他俩蹲在河边，一起做起来。

“首先，”米斯玛说，两手捧起一团湿泥巴，“我们做个小月亮。”老人把泥巴团挤成了一个圆盘，然后把边缘卷上去，月亮变成了一个空杯子。

缓慢地，笨拙地，他开始模仿老人那灵巧的动作。

“月亮，杯子，现在做条蛇。”米斯玛将另一团泥巴搓成了一条柔软的长柱形，盘成一个圈，按压到杯子沿上。“然后，再做一条蛇，再来一条，又一条。”一圈接一圈，米斯玛做出了罐子的边，最初很窄小，然后慢慢鼓出来，到了罐子颈部又变窄了。米斯玛又是挤，又是拍，又是抹，又是刮的。最后，罐子做好了，立在那里，形状和玛尔帕斯常见的水罐一样，但不是黑色的，而是乳白色的，摸起来软软的。立在它旁边歪歪扭扭的那个，是他模仿米斯玛做的罐子。看着两个罐子，他忍不住笑了。

“下一个就会好得多的。”他说，开始弄湿另一团泥巴。

塑造，成形，他感到自己的手指越来越灵巧、越来越有力，这令他很快乐。“A，B，C，维他命D，”他一边工作一边唱着，“脂肪在肝里，鳕鱼在海里。”米斯玛也在唱歌，一首关于猎熊的歌。他们一整天都在工作，一整天，他都忘我地沉浸在极度的快乐之中。

“明年冬天，”老米斯玛说，“我教你做弓箭。”




他在房子外面站了很长时间，里面的仪式终于结束了。门开了，人们走了出来。科斯鲁是第一个出来的，他的右胳膊向前伸着，紧握拳头，好像攥着什么珍贵的珠宝。琪雅吉美跟在后面出来了，攥紧的手也向前伸着。他们默默地走着，后面跟着他们的兄弟姐妹和表兄妹们，还有一大群老年人，他们也都一声不吭。

他们走出了村庄，穿过平顶的山。在悬崖边上，他们停住了，面对着初升的太阳。科斯鲁张开手，手掌上有一小撮玉米面，白白的，他对着玉米面吹口气，念叨了几句，冲着太阳撒掉了，一小把白色的粉尘。琪雅吉美重复了同样的动作。之后，琪雅吉美的父亲走上前来，举起一根带羽毛的祈祷杖，做了一个很长的祈祷，然后把手杖随着那些玉米面扔了下去。

“仪式完成了，”老米斯玛大声说，“他们结婚了。”

“哎呀，”琳达说，他们转身要离开了，“我只想说，这些都有点大题小做。在文明的国家，一个男孩想要一个女孩时，他只要……约翰，你去哪里？”

他没有理会她的招呼，跑开了，跑得很远，想一个人静一静。

完成了。老米斯玛的话依然萦绕在他的脑海里，完成了，完成了……他曾经默默地，离得远远地，爱着琪雅吉美，他爱得那么强烈、那么绝望、那么无助。现在，他们的仪式完成了。他那时十六岁。




月圆的时候，在羚羊穴里，会有人倾诉秘密，那里会产生秘密，也保守秘密。下到里面，进到地穴里的时候，他们是男孩子，出来的时候，变成了男人。男孩们都有点恐惧，但同时也都很渴望这一刻。终于，这一天到了。太阳下山，月亮升上来。他和其他男孩子一起下去了。一些男人站在地穴的入口，黑洞洞的人影。有梯子通向下面红光照亮的深处。领头的男孩子已经开始顺着梯子往下爬。突然，一个男人走上前来，抓住他的胳膊，把他拽出了队伍。他挣脱了，躲藏着，回到队伍中，和其他人站在一起。这次，这个男人打了他，揪住他的头发。“不要你，白毛！”“不要那个母狗下的崽！”另一个男人说。男孩们哄堂大笑。“滚开！”看到他还在人群的边上晃悠，“滚开！”男人们喊道。有一个人猫下腰，捡起一块石头，扔过来。“滚，滚，滚！”石头像雨点一样砸过来。他流着血，跑向黑暗处。从红光照耀的地穴深处传来一阵歌声。最后的男孩子已经爬下梯子。他完全孤独了。

孤孤单单一个人，在村庄的外面，在平顶高山光秃秃的台地上。在月色中，岩石像是漂白过的骨头。下面山谷中，郊狼在对着月亮哀嚎。那些石头擦破的地方非常疼，伤口还在流血，但是，他不是因为疼痛而哭泣，而是因为他的孤独，因为他被赶了出来，孤零零地，被赶到了这个岩石与月亮构成的骷髅世界。在悬崖边，他坐了下来。月亮在他的身后，他向下望着平顶山黑黑的阴影，望着死亡的暗影。他只要往前跨一步，轻轻一跳……在月色中，他伸出右手。从他手腕的伤口中，鲜血依然不停地渗出来。每过一会儿，就有一滴血落下来，很深的颜色，但在死亡般的光线下却近乎无色。一滴，两滴，三滴。明天，明天，明天(5)……

他发现了时间、死亡和上帝。




“独自一人，总是独自一人。”这个年轻人说。

这些话在伯纳德的头脑中唤起了悲凉的回响。独自一人，独自一人……“我也一样，”他说，一股倾诉的冲动涌上来，“孤独得要命。”

“你也是吗？”约翰看起来很吃惊，“我以为在‘那个地方’……我的意思是，琳达总是说在那个地方，从没有人感到孤独。”

伯纳德脸红了，感到很不自在。“你看啊，”他咕哝着说，眼睛望着别处，“我想，我和大多数人不太一样，如果一个人换瓶时就不同……”

“是的，就是那么回事，”年轻人点点头，“如果你和别人不同，你注定要孤独。他们对你很坏。你知道吗？他们不让我参与任何事？当其他男孩子都去山上过夜，你知道，要去那里做梦，去梦见自己的神兽到底是什么，他们不让我一块儿去，他们也不告诉我任何秘密。虽然我自己去过那里了。”他补充了一句，“连着五天什么都不吃，然后晚上独自一人上了那座山。”他指了指那座山。

伯纳德颇为居高临下地笑了笑。“你梦到什么了没有？”他问。

年轻人点点头。“我不能告诉你是什么。”他沉默了片刻，然后压低声音说，“有一次，”他接着说，“我做了一件其他人都没有做过的事。夏天，在中午时分，我靠着一块大岩石站着，伸出我的胳膊，就像十字架上的基督。”

“做那个干什么？”

“我想知道被钉在十字架上是什么感觉，在大太阳下，吊在那里……”

“可为什么呀？”

“为什么？嗯……”他犹豫起来，“因为我觉得应该这么做。如果基督能够忍受。还有，如果你做了错事……还有，我当时很不开心，这是另外一个原因。”

“用这个方法治疗你的不开心，够可笑的。”伯纳德说。但是再想了想之后，他又觉得这么做还是有点道理的，总比吃唆麻好……

“过了一会儿，我晕过去了，”年轻人说，“脸朝下躺倒在地。你看见我当时受伤留的疤了吗？”他把前额上浓密的黄头发撩起来。那个疤痕在他的右太阳穴部位，白白的，有点皱。

伯纳德看了一眼，然后哆嗦了一下，赶紧把眼睛移开了。他所受的训练没有让他变得充满同情心，而是变得过度娇气。任何疾病或伤口对他来讲都不仅仅是恐怖的，而且还让人抵触，令人恶心，就像灰尘、畸形或者老年什么的。他匆忙换了个话题。

“我在想，你愿不愿意和我们一起回伦敦？”他问道。自从在小房子里时意识到这个年轻野蛮人的“爸爸”是谁之后，他就在悄悄地谋划着一个战略，现在他迈出了这个战役的第一步，“你愿意去吗？”

年轻人的脸顿时露出喜色。“你是认真的吗？”

“当然了，如果我能得到许可证的话。”

“琳达也去吗？”

“嗯……”他不太肯定，犹豫着。那个令人恶心的家伙！不，那不可能，除非，除非……突然，伯纳德想到，她的恶心说不定会成为一笔巨大的财富。“当然！”他喊道，用这种过分的热情来弥补刚才的犹豫。

年轻人深深吸了一口气。“想想居然要实现了，我一直做梦都在盼望着的事。你还记得米兰达(6)是怎么说的吗？”

“谁是米兰达？”

很显然，年轻人没有听到这个问题。“哦，奇迹啊！(7)”他说，他的眼睛闪闪发亮，他的脸泛着红光，“这里有多少美好的人！人类是多么美丽！”他脸上的红晕突然加深了，他想起了列宁娜，一个穿着瓶子绿色黏胶衣服的天使，光彩照人，年轻，绸缎般的肌肤，丰满，善良地微笑着。他的声音颤抖了。“哦，美丽的新世界。”他说，突然又停住了，脸上血色全无，苍白得如同一张纸。“你和她结婚了吗？”他问。

“我什么？”

“结婚。你知道的，永远在一起。他们用印第安话说就是‘永远在一起’，你不能毁约的。”

“福帝，没有！”伯纳德忍不住笑了。

约翰也笑了，但原因不同，他是因为高兴而笑。

“哦，美丽的新世界，”他重复道，“哦，美丽的新世界，有这么出色的人物！我们马上出发吧。”

“有时候，你说话的方式真特别。”伯纳德说，吃惊且不解地看着这个年轻人，“还有，是不是等你真的见到这个新世界了，你再这么说？”

第九章


经历了一天的古怪遭遇和惊吓之后，列宁娜觉得自己有权享受一个完完全全、货真价实的假期。他们一回到宾馆，她就吞了六片半克的唆麻，躺在床上，不到十分钟，她就启程前往月球享受无尽的假期了。至少要十八个小时之后，她才能回到现实呢。

同时，伯纳德在黑暗中躺着，眼睛睁得大大的，心事重重。午夜过后许久，他才终于睡着了，是的，午夜过后许久。但是，他的失眠并不是毫无成果的，他想出了一个计划。

第二天上午，十点钟，那个穿绿制服的八分之一黑白混血儿准时走出直升机。伯纳德正在龙舌兰丛中等他。

“克朗小姐去度唆麻假了，”他解释道，“五点钟之前很难回来。我们有七个小时的时间。”

他可以飞到圣菲，去做他必须做的那些事情，在她醒来之前再回到玛尔帕斯。

“她一个人在这里安全吗？”

“和直升机一样安全。”黑白混血儿向他保证。

他们爬进飞机，立刻出发了。十点三十四分，他们降落在圣菲邮局的楼顶上；十点三十七分，伯纳德已经接通了白厅的世界控制官办公室的电话；十点三十九分，他已经在与福下的四等私人秘书通话了；十点四十四分，他已经在对一等秘书重复同样的话了；十点四十七分半，他耳畔响着的就已经是穆斯塔法·蒙德那深沉响亮的声音了。

“我斗胆想，”伯纳德结结巴巴地说，“福下您也许会觉得这件事具有足够的科研价值……”

“是的，我确实觉得这事很有科研价值。”那深沉的声音说，“你把那两个人都带回伦敦吧。”

“福下，您知道，我需要一个特别许可证……”

“必要的命令，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“现在正发往保留地总监那里。你现在要立即去他的办公室。上午好，马克斯先生。”

之后就毫无声息了。伯纳德放下电话，匆匆跑上楼顶。

“总监办公室。”他对穿伽马绿色的黑白混血儿说。

十点五十四分，伯纳德已经在和总监握手。

“非常高兴，马克斯先生，非常高兴，”他嗡嗡的声音恭恭敬敬。“我们刚刚收到了特别命令……”

“我知道，”伯纳德打断他的话，“刚才我和福下通电话了。”他的声音里透着倦怠，好像他习惯于每天和福下通电话一样。他坐到椅子上。“如果您能尽快采取必要的步骤，尽快。”他强调性地重复了一遍。他非常享受这一时刻。

十一点过三分，他就已经把所有必要的文件揣进口袋了。

“再见，”他居高临下地对总监说，总监一直陪他走到电梯门，“再见。”

他走向宾馆，洗了个澡，做了个真空振动按摩，用电动刮胡刀刮了胡子，听了听今天早晨的新闻，看了半小时电视，悠闲地吃了个午餐。两点半，他与那个黑白混血儿一起飞回了玛尔帕斯。




那个年轻人站在伯纳德宾馆房间的门口。

“伯纳德，”他叫道，“伯纳德！”没有人回答。

他穿着鹿皮靴的脚步无声无息，他跑上台阶，推了推门。门是锁着的。

他们走了！走了！这是他遭遇过的最糟糕的事情。她请他过来看看他们，现在，他们却走了。他坐在台阶上，哭了。

半小时后，他才想起来透过窗户往里看一看。他看见了一件东西，那是一个绿色手提箱，箱子盖上印着她名字的首字母L.C.。他内心的喜悦像一团火苗腾地升起来。他捡起一块小石头。砸碎的玻璃哗啦啦掉在地板上。片刻之后，他就在房间里面了。他打开绿色手提箱，列宁娜的香气扑鼻而来，他的肺里充满了她的存在。他的心怦怦乱跳，有一阵，他似乎要晕过去了。然后，他俯身在这宝贵的箱子上，摸了摸，举到光线下面，审视着。起初，列宁娜那条备用的绿色黏胶短裤上的拉链对他来讲是个难题，问题解决后，就是惊喜了。他滋啦啦地拉过来，又滋啦啦地拉过去，很着迷。她的绿拖鞋是他见过的最漂亮的东西了。他展开一条带拉链的内衣，羞红了脸，赶紧又收起来，但他亲吻了一条人造丝手绢，将一条围巾搭在自己的脖子上。他打开一个小盒子，香粉像一团雾散了出来，他的手沾上了这面粉一样的东西。他把它们擦在胸脯上，肩膀上，裸露的胳膊上。美妙的香气！他闭上眼睛，将脸颊在擦了粉的胳膊上蹭了蹭。他的脸触到了光滑的皮肤，鼻子闻着麝香味，好像她就在这里。“列宁娜，”他低声私语，“列宁娜！”

一阵响动吓了他一跳，他胆战心惊地转过身。他把偷偷拿出来的东西赶紧塞进手提箱，把箱盖盖好。他聆听着，又看了看。没有一丝活动的迹象，也没有一丝声音。可是，他刚才确确实实地听到了什么声音，像是叹气声，或者木板的吱嘎声。他踮着脚尖来到门口，小心地打开门，发现自己正面对着一个宽敞的平台。在平台的另一侧还有一道门，虚掩着。他走过去，推开门，偷偷往里面看。

在低矮的床上，床单掀开来，正躺着酣睡的列宁娜，她穿着连体式的粉色拉链睡衣裤，卷曲的头发散落在脸的周围，看起来是那么美丽，那粉色的脚趾头和安详沉睡的脸庞看起来像孩子一般动人，而她松垂的双手和柔软的四肢，看起来又是那么无助、那么安心。他的眼泪不自觉地涌了出来。

怀着无尽的小心——尽管这并不必要，因为不到预定的时间，只有手枪声才可能将列宁娜从唆麻假期中拉回来——他走进房间。他跪在床边的地板上，凝视着她。他两手攥得紧紧的，嘴唇嚅动着。“她的眼睛。”他喃喃自语，

“你告诉我，她是多么美丽，

她的眼睛、她的头发、她的面庞、

她的步态、她的语调。

啊！一切洁白的东西，

和她的玉手一比，

都会变成墨水一样黝黑，

受到它们自己的谴责；

比起她的盈盈一握来，

天鹅的绒毛都是坚硬的……”(1)

一只苍蝇围着列宁娜嗡嗡乱飞，他把它赶走了，“苍蝇，”他记起来了：

“……都可以接触亲爱的朱丽叶的皎洁的玉手，

从她的嘴唇上偷取天堂中的幸福，

那两片嘴唇是这样的纯洁贞淑，

永远含着娇羞，

好像觉得它们自身的相吻也是一种罪恶；”(2)

他缓缓地伸出手，犹犹豫豫地，好像要去触摸一只害羞而且可能非常危险的鸟儿。在离那些柔软的手指一英寸左右的时候，即将触碰到的时候，他的手停住了，颤抖着。他敢吗？敢用他这只最卑贱的手去亵渎那……(3)不，他不敢。那只鸟儿太危险了。他的手缩了回来。她多么美丽啊！多么美丽！

突然，他发觉自己在想，如果抓住她脖子后面的拉链，往下使劲地一拉……他闭上眼睛，摇摇头，就像一只刚从水里出来的狗甩动着耳朵。卑鄙的想法！他感到很羞愧。纯洁贞淑……

空中传来了嗡嗡的声音。又一只要从她嘴唇上偷取天堂般幸福的苍蝇吗？黄蜂吗？他看了看，什么都没有。嗡嗡声越来越大，在百叶窗外停住了。是飞机！他慌了，连滚带爬地站起来，跑进另外一个房间，跳过敞开的窗户，沿着高高的龙舌兰之间的小路跑去。他刚好赶上伯纳德·马克斯从直升机上爬出来。

第十章


布鲁姆斯伯里中心四千个房间里的四千个电子钟的指针同时指向下午两点二十七分。这只“工业的蜂巢”——主任喜欢这么称呼它——正在忙忙碌碌地工作着。每个人都在忙着，每件事情都有条不紊地进行着。在显微镜下，精子疯狂地甩动着长长的尾巴，低着头往卵子里面钻。受孕后的卵子正在膨胀，在分裂，或者如果经过了波卡诺夫斯基程序，正在忙着发芽，分裂成许多独立的胚胎。电梯正从社会命运预定室轰隆隆地运行到地下室，在那里，在暗红色的房间里，胚胎们暖暖地泡在腹膜垫上，吃饱了代血浆和荷尔蒙，它们正在长大，长大；或者，如果其中添加了有毒物质，它们正在逐渐憔悴，发育受挫，长成艾普西隆。瓶架子几乎不为人察觉地向前爬行着，发出轻微的嗡嗡声和咔嗒声，一个星期接着一个星期，一直到永恒，爬行着，进入换瓶室，刚刚换瓶的婴儿发出第一声恐惧而惊奇的哭叫。

地下二层的发电机呜呜地转动着，电梯匆匆地上上下下。总共十一个楼层的育婴室，现在全部都是哺育时间。从一千八百个瓶子里，一千八百个被精心贴了标签的婴儿正在同时吸食各自那一品脱消过毒的外分泌液。

在育婴室上面，是十个楼层的宿舍，还需要睡午觉的小男孩小女孩和其他人一样忙碌。虽然他们并不知道这点，但是，他们正在无意识地倾听着睡眠教育课程——卫生学和社交课、阶级意识课和幼童的爱情生活课。再往上走是游戏室，由于天刚刚开始下雨，所以，游戏室里，九百个稍微大一些的孩子正在玩耍，搭积木和做泥塑，做着找拉链游戏和性爱游戏。

嗡嗡嗡，嗡嗡嗡，蜂巢里一派忙碌，快乐的忙碌。年轻姑娘们一边俯身在试管上忙碌着，一边唱着欢快的歌曲；命运预定员们一边工作，一边吹着口哨；在换瓶室里，对着空空的瓶子，人们开着多么有趣的玩笑！可是，主任和亨利·福斯特一起走进受精室时，主任的脸却阴沉着，严厉地紧绷着。

“一个坏榜样，”他正在说，“就在这个房间里。因为这里高种姓的工人是我们中心最多的。我告诉他了，两点半在这里见我。”

“他工作干得不错。”亨利说，他的慷慨有点虚伪。

“我知道。但是，正因为如此，我们必须要严厉。他的超常智力伴随着更大的道德责任。一个人的才能越出众，误导他人走上歧途的能力就越大。宁可一个人受苦，也不让多数人被腐蚀。理智地看待这个问题，福斯特先生，你就会明白，没有任何罪过比不守常规的行为更讨厌了。谋杀只是杀死个体，毕竟，个体又是什么呢？”他挥挥手，指了指那些成排的显微镜、试管和孵化器，“我们可以轻易地制造个体，想造多少就造多少。可是，不守常规的行为威胁的不仅仅是个体的生命，它打击的是社会本身。是的，是社会本身。”他重复了一遍，“哦，他来了。”

伯纳德走进了房间，从两排受精员中间走向他们。表面上的志得意满和满怀信心勉强掩盖住了他的紧张情绪。“上午好(1)，主任，”他的声音异常地大，紧接着，为了纠正刚才的错误，他说，“您让我来这里跟您谈谈。”声音又轻得近乎荒唐，几乎像是在吱吱叫。

“是啊，马克斯先生，”主任盛气凌人地说，“我是让你来这里见我了。我想，你是昨天晚上休假回来的。”

“是的。”伯纳德回答。

“是——的。”主任拉着长音重复了一遍，像蛇一样发出了嘶音，突然，他提高了嗓门，“女士们，先生们——”像个喇叭在广播，“女士们，先生们——”

对着试管忙活的姑娘们停止了唱歌，显微镜操作员们心不在焉的口哨声也戛然而止。房间里一片静寂，每个人都扭头向这边看过来。

“女士们，先生们，”主任再次说，“原谅我这样打断你们的工作。痛苦的责任感使我不得不这么做。社会的安全和稳定正陷于危险中。是的，女士们，先生们，陷于危险之中。这个人，”他谴责一般地指着伯纳德，“站在这里的这个人，这个阿尔法＋，社会赋予了他那么多，自然，社会也指望他贡献更多，你们的这个同事——或许我可以提前说，你们的这个前同事？——他严重地背叛了社会对他的信任，他那些关于运动和唆麻的异端邪说，他那不合常规、耸人听闻的性生活，他拒绝遵从福帝的教导，在工作时间之外的行为作风‘就像个小孩子’。”（主任划了个T字。）“女士们，先生们，他的行为表明他已经沦为社会的敌人，一切秩序和稳定的颠覆者，对抗文明本身的密谋者。因为这个原因，我提议开除他，解除他在本中心的职务，令他声名狼藉；我还建议，申请把他调到最低级的分中心，让他尽可能远离重要的人口中心，这样，对他的惩罚才能为社会的利益服务。在冰岛，他那非福帝式的行为就没有多少机会引人误入歧途了。”主任停住了，交叉抱住两只胳膊，转向伯纳德，威严地说：“马克斯，你能给我一个理由，让我不执行对你的判决吗？”

“能，我能。”伯纳德响亮地回答。

主任吃了一惊，但还是义正词严地说：“把你的理由拿出来吧。”

“当然，可我的理由在走廊里。稍等片刻。”伯纳德匆匆跑到门口，推开了门。“进来吧。”他发出命令，那个理由就进来了，出现在众人眼前。

人们都倒抽了一口气，惊恐地窃窃私语，一个年轻姑娘尖叫起来，还有人站到椅子上想好好看看，结果碰倒了两只装满精子的试管。琳达走进了房间，浑身浮肿，肌肉松弛，在那些年轻坚实的肉体和平展光滑的面孔之间，她就像一个奇怪而可怕的中年怪物。她卖弄风情似的微笑着，一个花容失色、七零八碎的微笑；她走路时还摇摆着她那巨大的屁股，仍然以为自己在细腰款款地迤逦而行。伯纳德走在她的旁边。

“他就在那里。”他说，指着主任。

“你以为我认不出他来吗？”琳达愤愤不平地问。她转向主任。“我当然还认识你，托马金。无论在哪里，即使在一千个人中间，我都能认出你的。不过你可能忘了我了。你不记得了吗？难道你不记得了吗，托马金？你的琳达呀。”她站在那里，看着他，头歪向一侧，仍然微笑着，但是，当她看到主任脸上的震惊与厌恶，她的微笑就变得越来越不自信，犹豫了，直至最后消失。“难道你不记得了吗，托马金？”她颤抖着声音又重复了一遍。她的眼神是那么焦急、那么痛苦。她那长了斑的松弛的脸奇怪地扭曲着，显得极度悲伤。“托马金！”她伸出双臂。有人开始嘻嘻笑起来。

“这是什么意思？”主任说，“这个可怕的……”

“托马金！”她跑向前，毛毡拖在身后，两手猛地搂住主任的脖子，把脸埋在他的胸前。

一阵不可抑制的哄堂大笑。

“这个可怕的恶作剧！”主任大喊。

他涨红了脸，试图从她的怀抱中挣脱出来，她拼命地拽住他。“可我是琳达，我是琳达。”她的声音被笑声淹没了。“你让我怀了个孩子。”她大喊，声音压住了周围的喧嚣。人们突然陷入可怕的沉默，目光尴尬地游移着，不知道该往哪里看。主任的脸色突然变得煞白，他停止了挣扎，站在那里，双手放在她的手腕上，惊恐地盯着她。“是啊，一个孩子，我是他的妈妈。”她挑战一般，把这些脏话甩向周围义愤填膺的静寂中。之后，她突然从他身边离开了，羞愧地，羞愧地，用双手捂住了脸，哭泣着。“那不是我的错，托马金，因为我每次都做操，难道不是吗？难道不是吗？每次都做……我不知道怎么回事。托马金，要是你知道那多么可怕……可是，尽管如此，他对我还是一大安慰。”

她转向门口。“约翰！”她叫道，“约翰！”

他马上进来了，在门里面停留了片刻，向周围看了看，然后，他快步穿过房间，鹿皮靴悄无声息地踏在地板上，他走到主任面前，双膝着地跪下，口齿清晰地说：“爸爸！”

这个词（也许由于“爸爸”一词的含义与那个可憎而道德败坏的表示生育的词有一段距离，它没有那么猥亵，仅仅是粗俗而已。这个词仅仅是肮脏的，而不是淫秽的），这个可笑的脏词，打破了刚才几乎令人难以忍受的紧张感。笑声再次爆发出来，响亮的、有点歇斯底里的笑声，一阵接着一阵，好像再也停不下来了。我的爸爸，而这个人居然是主任！我的爸爸！哦，福帝！哦，福帝！这个笑话太可笑了。呵呵声和哈哈声再次爆发，那些脸几乎都要笑得裂开了，眼泪都笑了出来。又有人打破了六只装精子的试管。我的爸爸！

主任脸色苍白，眼神狂乱，瞪视着四周，他痛苦，不解，羞愧难忍。

我的爸爸！刚刚要平静下去的笑声再次爆发，比刚才更响亮了。他捂住耳朵，冲出了房间。

受精室那番风波过后，伦敦所有的高种姓人都迫切地想见见那个跪在孵化与条件训练中心主任面前的可爱家伙——或者说是前主任吧，因为那个可怜的人在风波之后马上辞职了，再也没有走进中心一步。那个可爱的家伙扑通跪下，叫他“我的爸爸”（这个笑话简直好笑得令人难以置信）。相反，琳达可没有造成这种效果，没有一个人有一丁点想见到她的欲望。说一个人是妈妈，这可不再是笑话了，而是淫秽。另外，她也并不是真正的野蛮人，和大家一样，她也是在瓶子里发育并受训练的，她不可能有真正古怪的想法。最后，人们丝毫不想见到可怜的琳达的最重要的原因，是她的模样：肥胖，青春不再，一口坏牙，暗沉的皮肤，还有那身材（福帝！），你看到她不可能不感到恶心，是的，真真正正地感到恶心。所以，好人们下定决心不去看她。琳达自己呢，根本也不想看到他们。对她而言，回归文明就等于回归服用唆麻，等于躺在床上一个接一个度假的可能性，而度假回来后根本不会头痛，也不会恶心呕吐，不像喝了拍约他酒后的那种感觉，酒后会觉得自己就像做了什么令人不齿的反社会的事，感到抬不起头来。唆麻不会开这种令人不愉快的玩笑。唆麻带给她的假期是完美的，如果说第二天早晨不那么舒服的话，也不是真的不舒服，那只是同在唆麻假期里的快乐相比较而言的。补救之道就是连续度假。她贪婪地、益发频繁地要求服用更大剂量的唆麻。开始时，肖医生提出过异议，后来就由着她的性子了。她每天吃的唆麻多达二十克。

“这样下去，一两个月之后她就不行了，”医生对伯纳德吐露了实情，“总有一天，她的呼吸中心会瘫痪，不再能够呼吸，就完蛋了。也许不是什么坏事。如果我们能使她恢复青春，那又是另外一回事。可惜，我们做不到。”

令每个人都吃惊的是（琳达度唆麻假时，不会妨碍任何人的事），倒是约翰提出了反对意见。

“每天给她吃那么多，会不会缩短她的生命啊？”

“在某种意义上，是的，”肖医生承认，“但是，在另外一个意义上，我们也在延长她的生命。”年轻人不解地盯着他。“也许唆麻会使你丧失几年的时间，”医生接着说，“但是，你想想，在时间之外又赋予你多么悠长的岁月啊。每个唆麻假期都是我们祖先们所称道的那种永恒啊。”

约翰有点明白了。“永恒就在我们的唇间和双眼。(1)”他喃喃自语。

“嗯？”

“没什么。”

“当然了，”肖医生接着说，“如果人们有正经工作，你就不能让他们总是跑到永恒之中，可是，她又没有什么事情可做……”

“不管怎样，”约翰坚持道，“我还是觉得这么做是不对的。”

医生耸了耸肩。“那么，如果你愿意整天听她大哭小叫的话……”

最终，约翰还是不得不妥协了。琳达拿到了唆麻。从此之后，她就整天待在伯纳德公寓楼三十七楼的小房间里，躺在床上，收音机和电视机一直开着，广藿香的龙头滴答着，唆麻片放在她触手可及的地方，她就这么待在那里。或者说，她根本就没有在那里，而是一直待在某个遥远的地方度假，在某个虚无缥缈的地方度假。在那里，收音机里播放的音乐如同五颜六色的声音构成的迷宫，一个悸动的滑音的迷宫，通向（不可避免地绕过了多么美妙的曲折呀）绝对信仰的明亮的中心；在那里，电视机里舞动的影像如同一场妙不可言的音乐感官电影里的表演者；在那里，滴滴下落的广藿香不仅仅是香味，而更像是太阳，是一百万个萨克斯管，是和她做爱的波培，但是，又都有过之而无不及，无与伦比地美妙，并且无穷无尽。

“不行，我们没办法为她恢复青春。但是，我很高兴，”肖医生总结道，“有这个机会亲眼观察人类的老年。谢谢你来找我。”他热情地握了握伯纳德的手。

大家都想见的人是约翰。但是，只有通过伯纳德这个已经得到认可的监护人，他们才能见到约翰。现在，平生第一次，伯纳德发现自己不仅得到了正常的待遇，而且被看成了杰出人物。人们不再谈论他的代血浆里的酒精，不再嘲笑他的相貌。亨利·福斯特专门对他示好，本尼托·胡佛送给他六包性荷尔蒙口香糖，命运预定室主任的助理跑过来，卑躬屈膝地哀求着，想获邀参加伯纳德组织的聚会。至于女人嘛，伯纳德只要稍稍做出邀请她们的暗示，马上就可以随便挑选他喜欢的女人。

“伯纳德请我周三去见见那个野蛮人。”范妮得意地宣布。

“我很高兴，”列宁娜说，“现在你得承认你以前对伯纳德的看法不对了吧！难道你不认为他其实很可爱吗？”

范妮点点头。“我必须得说，”她说，“我真是又惊又喜。”

装瓶室主任、预定室主任、总受精员的三位助理、情感工程学院的感官电影专业教授、威斯敏斯特社区唱堂的教长、波卡诺夫斯基程序总监——伯纳德名单上的名流多得数不过来。

“上周，我到手了六个姑娘，”他对赫尔姆霍茨倾诉秘密，“周一一个，周二两个，周五两个，周六一个。如果我有时间，或者我想的话，至少还有六七个，她们都急于……”

赫尔姆霍茨一声不吭地听着他的吹嘘，阴沉着脸，一副颇不以为然的样子，伯纳德很生气。

“你嫉妒了。”他说。

赫尔姆霍茨摇了摇头。“我只是很悲哀，就这些。”他回答。

伯纳德气哼哼地离开了。他对自己说，再也不，决不再同赫尔姆霍茨讲话了。

日子一天天地过去了。成功瞬间来到，几乎冲昏了伯纳德的头脑，也让他和这个至今为止他一直非常不满意的世界和解了（和任何使人沉醉的东西一样）。只要这个世界承认他的重要性，那么，一切秩序都是良好的。虽然成功让他和这个世界和解了，但是，他并没有放弃批判其秩序的权利，批判的行为反而加重了他的自以为是，让他觉得自己更加伟大了。另外，他真的认为世上有可批判之事。（与此同时，他也真的喜欢成功的感觉，喜欢想要哪个女孩就要哪一个的感觉。）在那些因野蛮人的缘故而取悦他的人面前，他会显摆他的吹毛求疵与不落俗套。他们客气地听他讲，但是，在他背后，他们却摇着头。“那个年轻人不会有好下场的。”他们说，非常有把握地预言，因为他们自己到时候都会确保他不会有好的下场。“他不会再找到第二个野蛮人来帮他解围。”他们说。同时呢，第一个野蛮人还在，他们还得对他客客气气。正因为他们的客气，伯纳德觉得自己真的变得很高大——巨大，同时，又很轻，轻得飘飘然，比空气还轻。




“比空气还轻。”伯纳德说，指指上面。

天气局的气球高高地飘在空中，远远的，高过他们的头顶，像天空中的一颗珍珠，在阳光下闪着玫瑰红的光。

“……刚才谈到的那个野蛮人，”伯纳德像是在做讲座，“给他展示文明社会的方方面面……”

他们正在给野蛮人展示这个文明社会的鸟瞰图，从查令T字塔上的平台上。航空站长和站内气象学家当他的向导，但是，伯纳德介绍得最多。他陶醉在自己的成功中，表现得好像自己就是正在这里访问的世界控制官。比空气还轻。

来自孟买的绿色火箭刚刚从空中降落。乘客们正在走下火箭。八个穿卡其色制服的一模一样的德拉威人正在从机舱的八个舷窗里往外看，他们是乘务员。

“每小时一千二百五十公里。”站长神气地说，“你觉得怎么样，野蛮人先生？”

约翰觉得很好。“不过，”他说，“爱丽儿(2)四十分钟就能绕地球一圈。”

“这个野蛮人，”伯纳德在给穆斯塔法·蒙德的报告中写道，“对文明世界的发明极少流露出惊叹或敬畏，这令人吃惊。毫无疑问，部分原因是他曾听那个女人琳达，他的母—，谈论过这些。”

（穆斯塔法·蒙德看到这里皱皱眉头。“难道这个傻瓜觉得我太过敏感，看到‘母亲’这个词全部拼写出来都会受不了？”）

“部分原因是，他的兴趣都集中在他所谓的‘灵魂’上，他坚持认为，灵魂是独立于物质世界的，而我一直在试图向他指出……”

控制官跳过下面的几句话，正想翻过这页，找点更具体、更有趣的内容，这时，他的目光突然落到了一串不同寻常的字句上。“……尽管我必须承认，”他接着读下去，“我和野蛮人的观点相同，认为这种幼稚的文明来得太过容易，或者用他的话说，不够昂贵。因此，我希望借此机会，请福下您注意……”

穆斯塔法·蒙德的愤怒立即转化为好笑。想想这个家伙居然在这里一本正经地给他——给他——讲社会秩序，太荒唐了。这个家伙一定是疯了。“我应该教训他一下。”他心里想。然后，他仰起头来，哈哈大笑。无论如何，现在给他这个教训还为时过早。




这是一家生产直升机照明设备的小型工厂，是电子设备公司的分厂。他们在楼顶上受到了技术总管和人事部经理的欢迎（那封广为传阅的控制官的推荐信真是具有魔力）。他们一起下楼进入工厂。

“每个步骤，”人事部经理向他们解释，“都尽量由同属一个波卡诺夫斯基组别的工人承担。”

实际上，八十三个几乎没有鼻子的短脑袋、黑皮肤的德尔塔正在做冷轧工作，五十六个长着鹰钩鼻、姜黄色皮肤的伽马正在操作五十六台四轴的夹具车床，一百零七个受过耐热训练的塞内加尔艾普西隆正在铸造车间工作，三十三个女性德尔塔，长长的脑袋，沙色的皮肤，窄小的臀部，身高约一米六九（误差最大不超过两毫米），正在切削螺丝。在装配车间，两组伽马+矮人正在组装发电机。两排低矮的工作台面对面摆放，中间一条装载着零部件的传送带正在缓慢前行，四十七个金黄色的脑袋和四十七个棕色的脑袋面对面工作着，四十七个狮子鼻面对着四十七个鹰钩鼻，四十七个后缩的下巴对着四十七个前翘的下巴。完成的机械制品由十八个长得一模一样的有红褐色鬈发的绿衣伽马姑娘进行检验，由三十四个短腿的左撇子德尔塔－男人进行打包装箱，由六十三个蓝眼睛、浅黄色头发、长着雀斑的艾普西隆半白痴装入等待的卡车。

“哦，美丽的新世界……”不知怎么回事，野蛮人不知不觉地重复起米兰达的话，“哦，美丽的新世界，有这么出色的人物！”

“而且，我敢对你说，”人事部经理总结道，“我们的工人几乎不会制造任何麻烦。我们总是发现……”

但是，野蛮人突然离开了他的同伴们，到桂树丛后面剧烈地呕吐起来，好像这坚实的土地变成了气旋中的直升机。




“这个野蛮人，”伯纳德写道，“拒绝服用唆麻，并且，因为他的母—，琳达，总是在度唆麻假，他感到很痛苦。值得注意的是，尽管他的母—很衰老，长相又令人恶心，野蛮人还是经常去看她，似乎很依恋她。这个有趣的例子完全可以证明，早期的条件训练能够改变甚至克服自然的本能（在此情况下，指回避令人不快的对象的本能）。”




到了伊顿，他们降落在高年级部的楼顶。学校的对面，是五十二层高的鲁普顿塔，在阳光下闪耀着白色的光。左边是学院，右边则是高高耸立的学校社区唱堂，由钢铁水泥和维塔玻璃建成的可敬的建筑物。在方形广场的中央，矗立着福帝的雕像，古老而奇特。

他们走出飞机的时候，学院院长加夫尼博士和校长基特小姐迎接了他们。

“你们这里多胞胎很多吗？”他们刚刚开始参观之旅，野蛮人就忧心忡忡地问。

“哦，没有，”院长回答，“伊顿是专门为高种姓的男孩女孩开设的。一个卵子只长成一个成人。当然，这给教育造成很大困难，但是，他们将来需要承担更大的责任，处理难以预料的紧急情况，所以，这也没有办法的事。”他叹了口气。

与此同时，伯纳德立刻对基特小姐产生了兴趣。“如果你周一、周三或周五晚上有空，”他对她说，用大拇指指着野蛮人，“他很有意思，你知道的，”伯纳德又补充道，“怪怪的。”

基特小姐笑了一下（他觉得她的笑容实在迷人），说了声谢谢，很高兴去参加他的聚会。院长打开了一道门。在那间阿尔法+的教室里刚刚待了五分钟，约翰就有点晕头晕脑了。

“什么是基础相对论啊？”他悄悄问伯纳德。伯纳德试图解释，想了想还是算了，而是提议去另一间教室。

从通向贝塔-地理教室的走廊的一道门背后，传来了清脆的女高音。“一，二，三，四，”然后，带着不耐烦的厌倦口气说，“照刚才的做。”

“马尔萨斯操，”女校长解释道，“当然，这里的大多数女孩是不孕的，我自己就是。”她对伯纳德笑笑，“但我们这里有大约八百个没有绝育的女孩，所以需要长期操练。”

在贝塔-们的地理教室里，约翰了解到：“野蛮人保留地是那些由于不利的气候或地理条件，或者由于自然资源的匮乏，而不值得斥资进行文明化的地方。”咔嗒一声，房间暗下来了。突然，在老师头上的屏幕上，出现了阿科马的忏悔者匍匐在圣母脚下的景象，他们哭号着，就像约翰曾经亲耳听见的那样，在十字架上的耶稣和老鹰形象的菩公面前，忏悔自己的罪孽。那些年轻的伊顿学生几乎要笑翻了天。忏悔者依旧哭号着，站了起来，剥去上半身的衣服，拿起打了结的皮鞭，开始抽打自己，一下接一下。学生们都笑弯了腰，笑声甚至盖住了忏悔者加大了的呻吟声。

“可是，他们为什么要笑呢？”野蛮人问，他感到既痛苦又迷惑。

“为什么？”院长转过身来，他咧着嘴巴还在笑，“为什么？因为这特别滑稽啊。”

在如同电影院里的朦胧光线中，伯纳德做出了一个大胆的举动，在过去，即使在完全的黑暗中他也是不敢这么做的。借着自己刚刚获得的重要身份，他伸出胳膊，揽住了女校长的腰。那杨柳细腰软软地应和着。他刚想偷偷亲一两下，或者轻轻掐一把，百叶窗又咔嗒打开了。

“我们还是继续吧。”女校长说，向门口走去。

“这个，”过了一会儿，院长说，“是睡眠控制室。”

成百上千的合成音乐盒子，一个教室一个，都摆放在房间三面墙的架子上。第四面墙上的小搁架上，摆放着一卷卷纸质录音带，上面印着各种睡眠教育课程。

“你把录音带放进这里，”伯纳德解释道，打断了加夫尼博士，“按一下这个开关。”

“不是，是那一个。”院长纠正道，很恼火。

“哦，就那一个吧。录音带展开。硒光电管将光波转换成音波，然后……”

“然后，就好了。”加夫尼博士总结道。

“他们读莎士比亚吗？”野蛮人问道，他们走过学校的图书馆，正走向生化实验室。

“当然不读了。”女校长说，脸涨得通红。

“我们的图书馆，”加夫尼博士说，“只有各种参考书籍。如果年轻人需要消遣，他们完全可以去看感官电影。我们不鼓励他们沉迷于孤独的娱乐。”

五辆公交车从他们身旁的玻璃化路面驶过，里面坐满了小男孩和小女孩，他们或者在唱歌，或者静静地搂抱在一起。

“刚刚回来，”加夫尼博士解释，伯纳德正在悄悄地与女校长订好今天晚上的约会，“从斯劳火葬场回来。从他们十八个月大时，死亡训练就开始了。每个孩子每周有两个上午都待在临终医院。最好的玩具都放在那里，每个死亡日，他们还可以得到巧克力冰淇淋。他们学会了把死亡看成自然而然的事情。”

“就像其他所有生理过程一样。”女校长颇为专业地补充。

八点钟，萨沃依见，都约好了。




在回伦敦的路上，他们在位于布伦特福德的电视公司工厂停了下来。

“我去打个电话，你不介意等一会儿吧？”伯纳德问。

野蛮人一边等着，一边四周看。主白班刚好正在下班。一群群低种姓的工人正在单轨车站前排着队，七八百个伽马、德尔塔和艾普西隆，有男有女，相貌和身材却只有几种。售票员在递给每个人票的时候，还给他们一个小小的硬纸板药盒。长龙般的队伍缓慢地向前挪动。

“那些匣子（他想起了《威尼斯商人》(3)）里是什么？”伯纳德回来时，野蛮人问他。

“今天的唆麻配额，”伯纳德含混地说，他正在嚼一片本尼托·胡佛送给他的口香糖，“下班之后，他们就可以拿到。四片半克的药片。周六是六片。”

他亲热地拉住约翰的胳膊，两个人一起走回直升机。




列宁娜唱着歌走进更衣室。

“你看起来挺高兴嘛。”范妮说。

“我很高兴。”她回答。拉链唰的一声。“半小时前伯纳德打电话了，”唰！唰！她从短裤里迈出来，“他临时有个约会。”唰！“问我今晚能否带野蛮人去看感官电影。我得飞走了。”她匆匆走入浴室。

“她真幸运！”范妮心里想，看着列宁娜离去。

这句评论里没有一丝嫉妒，好脾气的范妮只是在陈述事实。列宁娜确实幸运。她和伯纳德一起，幸运地分享了野蛮人的巨大名气，尽管本人并不起眼，从她身上却幸运地反射出此刻最流行的荣耀。年轻女子福帝协会的秘书不是已经邀请她去做一个关于她经历的讲座了吗？爱神俱乐部不是已经邀请她参加年度晚宴了吗？她不是已经上了感官电影新闻了吗？全球数以亿计的观众不是都已经看到，听到，触摸到她了吗？

更使她受宠若惊的是，许多重要人物也都已经开始关注她了。世界控制官的二等秘书已经邀请她共进晚餐和早餐了。她已经分别与福帝最高法官以及坎特伯雷唱堂的首席歌唱家共度过周末了。内分泌与外分泌公司的总裁几乎总是在给她打电话，而她也已经和欧洲银行的副行长一起去过多维尔了。

“很美妙，当然了，可是，在某种程度上，”她对范妮说，“我感到好像自己是靠欺骗才获得了这一切。他们想知道的第一件事就是跟野蛮人做爱是什么滋味的，而我不得不说，我不知道。”她摇摇头，“他们大多数人都不相信我的话，这是自然的。可这是真的。我倒是希望这不是真的。”她忧伤地补充道，叹了口气，“他长得多帅啊，难道你不这样认为吗？”

“他不喜欢你吗？”范妮问。

“有时候，我觉得他喜欢我，有时候又觉得不喜欢。他总是尽量躲着我，我一进屋，他就离开，碰都不碰我，连看都不看我。可是，有时候，我突然转身的时候，我发现他在盯着我看，而且，那表情，你也知道，男人喜欢你的时候表情就是那样的。”

是的，范妮知道。

“我弄不明白。”列宁娜说。

她弄不明白，不仅很迷惑，而且也很烦恼。

“因为，你知道，范妮，我喜欢他。”

越来越喜欢他。现在，终于有个真正的机会了，她洗完澡，一边给自己洒香水，一边在想。洒啊，洒啊，洒啊，一个真正的机会。她的情绪高涨起来，不自觉地唱起了歌。

“抱紧我，让我迷醉，亲爱的；

亲吻我，直到我沉醉；

抱紧我，亲爱的，暖暖的兔乖乖；

爱情如唆麻一般可爱。”

香味机器正在播放出令人神清气爽的卡普奇诺植物香气，一阵一阵的百里香、香草、迷迭香、紫苏草、桃金娘和龙蒿的香气构成的琶音起伏着飘过来，一串大胆的变调通过香味音符逐渐融入了龙涎香，经由檀香、樟脑、香柏和新割的干草香（期间也有淡淡的不太协调的香气，一丝猪腰子布丁，和一丝若有若无的猪粪味儿）之后，又缓缓地回归最初的那种比较朴素的香气。最后的百里香气味消失了，一阵鼓掌的声音，灯光跟着亮起来了。在合成乐器里，音带开始播放。是一首超级小提琴、超级大提琴和代双簧管的三重奏，空中顿时有了一种令人愉快的慵懒气息。三十或四十个小节后，在这种乐器构成的背景乐伴奏下，一个远超过人类的声音开始吟唱，忽而是喉音，忽而是头音，忽而如笛声一样空灵，忽而又变为充满渴望的和声。这声音轻轻松松地从加斯帕·福斯特达到音调极限的破纪录的低音，转换为蝙蝠般颤抖的高音，甚至比最高的C音还要高，卢克里齐亚·阿加伽里曾经尖厉地发出过这个C音（1770年，在帕尔马公爵歌剧院里，曾令莫扎特大感吃惊），这是历史上所有歌唱家中唯一的一个。

深深地陷在充气座位里，列宁娜和野蛮人一边闻着，一边听着。现在，到了用眼睛看和用皮肤感觉的时候了。

大厅里的灯全部暗下去了，火红的字母非常真切、显眼，在黑暗中似乎是悬停在那里的。“《直升机里的三星期》。全超级演唱、合成声音、彩色立体感官电影，合成香味器同步伴奏。”

“抓住椅子扶手上的这些金属把手，”列宁娜低声说，“否则，你就体会不到感官电影的效果。”

野蛮人照着做了。

同时，那些火红的字母消失了，之后，有十秒钟的黑暗。突然，前方出现了闪耀的立体影像，是一个巨大的黑人和一个短脑袋的金发贝塔-女孩紧紧地搂抱在一起，似乎比现实更真实，比现实的肉体之身更具立体感。

野蛮人吓了一跳。他嘴唇上的感觉！他抬起一只手摸摸嘴，痒痒的感觉消失了。他把手放回金属扶手上，那种感觉又来了。同时，香味器散发出纯净的麝香气味。音带里一只超级鸽子像就要死去了一样，“咕咕，咕咕”地叫着，一个比非洲低音更深沉的声音，每秒三十二次地振动着，发出“啊，啊，哦啊，哦啊”的回应。随着画面上的立体嘴唇再次碰触到一起，阿尔罕布拉宫电影院里六千个观众的嘴唇再次麻酥酥的，触电般的快乐几乎让人难以忍受。“哦……”

电影的情节极其简单。最初的“哦”和“啊”之后不久（一首二重唱过后，一段性爱戏在那著名的熊皮上上演了，正像命运预定室主任助理说的那样，熊皮上的每根毫毛都清晰可辨），那个黑人驾驶直升机出了事故，摔伤了头。咕咚！前额简直太疼了！观众中发出一阵“哦哟”“哎呀”的叫声。

这次撞击把黑人受过的条件训练全部都打乱了。他对那个金发姑娘产生了排他性的疯狂感情。她抗议了，可是他坚持不懈。电影里有挣扎，有追逐，有对情敌的袭击，最后还有一段耸人听闻的绑架。金发贝塔姑娘被劫掠到高空，被迫悬停在空中，不得不与那个黑人疯子单独度过三个星期的私密时光，这真是严重反社会的行为。最后，经过一系列冒险和大量的空中杂技般的表演，三个年轻英俊的阿尔法小伙子成功地解救了姑娘。黑人被打发到一个成年再训练中心，电影快乐而体面地结束了，金发贝塔女郎同时成为三个解救者的情人。这时，电影插入了他们的一段合成四重唱，由超级管弦乐队伴奏，同时香味器散播着栀子花的香气。之后，熊皮戏再次上演，色克斯乐大作，最后的立体亲吻在黑暗中逐渐淡出，最后的触电般的酥麻感渐渐地消逝在唇间，如同一只垂死的飞蛾，颤动着，颤动着，越来越微弱，越来越微弱，最终陷入静寂，一动不动。

但是，对列宁娜来说，那只飞蛾并没有完全死去。即使灯光全部亮起来之后，当他们和人群一起，慢慢地挪向电梯的时候，那只飞蛾的幽灵仍然还在她的唇边扑打着翅膀，仍然还在她的肌肤上缓缓地逡巡着，带给她渴望和快乐。她脸颊通红，眼睛发亮，呼吸加深。她抓住野蛮人的胳膊，把它紧贴在自己软软的身体一侧。他低下头看了她片刻，脸色苍白，他痛苦，充满渴望，可又为自己的欲望感到羞耻。他配不上，配不上……他们的眼睛有一瞬间对视了。她的眼神向他允诺了多少的珍宝啊！简直抵得上女王的赎金了。可他却赶忙移开了自己的视线，抽出了被她拉住的胳膊。他心里暗暗有点恐惧，怕她不再是自己感觉配不上的那个女孩。

“我觉得你不应该看这些东西。”他说，赶紧把那些过去玷污了或未来可能玷污列宁娜完美的过失转嫁给周遭的环境，而不是归罪于她本人。

“哪些东西，约翰？”

“比如刚才那可怕的电影。”

“可怕？”列宁娜真心地感到诧异，“我觉得很好呀。”

“这个电影很下流，”他愤愤地说，“很卑鄙。”

她摇摇头。“我不懂你的意思。”为什么他这么奇怪呢？为什么他总是刻意地搅乱情绪呢？

在出租直升机里，他看都不看她一眼。他别着脸，一言不发地坐在那里，为那些从来没有说出口的誓言所约束，遵从着那些早已失效的法则。时不时地，他的整个身体会突然神经质地打一个激灵，好像有根手指拨动了某根紧张得快要崩断的琴弦。

出租直升机降落在列宁娜公寓的楼顶上。“终于。”她走出直升机时得意地想。终于有机会了，虽然他刚才表现得那么奇怪。站在灯下，她照了照小镜子。终于有机会了。是的，她的鼻子有点发亮。她从粉扑里拍落了一点散粉。他还在付出租飞机钱，时间刚好够用。她抹了抹鼻子上发亮的地方，心里想：“他太帅了，根本不必像伯纳德那么害羞。可是……换其他男人的话早就做了。啊，现在，终于。”小圆镜子里面露出的那部分脸蛋突然对着她莞尔一笑。

“晚安。”她身后传来窒息般的声音。列宁娜猛地转过去。他正站在出租飞机的门边，眼睛紧盯着她，很明显，她刚才在鼻子上扑粉时，他一直在看着，等待着，可是等待着什么呢？或者说，他在犹豫？试图下定决心，一直在想，在想——她难以想象他会有些什么异样的想法。“晚安，列宁娜。”他又说了一遍，脸上有种奇怪的表情，他似乎试图在笑。

“可是，约翰，我以为你要……我是说，你难道不想……”

他关上门，向前对着驾驶员说了点什么。出租飞机立刻冲上天空。

透过飞机地板的窗口，野蛮人可以看见列宁娜扬起来的脸，在淡蓝色的灯光下，看起来是那么苍白。她张着嘴，在喊着什么。她越来越小的身体急速地离他而去，在黑暗中，越来越小的方形楼顶似乎在向下降落。

五分钟之后，他就回到了自己的房间。从一个隐藏处，他把那老鼠啃过的书卷拿了出来，带着对宗教般的谨慎翻动着那些脏污卷曲的书页，开始阅读《奥赛罗》。奥赛罗，他想起来了，就像《直升机里的三星期》的男主角一样，是个黑人。

列宁娜擦干了眼睛，穿过楼顶，来到电梯口。在下降到二十七楼的过程中，她掏出了唆麻瓶。她决定，一克都不够，她的痛苦可远不是一克的量。可是，如果她吃两克，就有第二天早晨不能准时醒来的危险。她只好折中了一下，往左手掌心里晃出了三片半克的药片。

第十二章


伯纳德不得不对着紧锁的门大喊，野蛮人就是不开门。

“可大家都在那里，等着你呢。”

“就让他们等着吧。”从门里面传来瓮声瓮气的声音。

“可是，你很清楚，约翰，”（尖着嗓子大喊还想让声音具有说服力，这太难了！）“我是特意邀请他们来见你的。”

“你应该先问问我是否想见他们。”

“可你以前一直都来的，约翰。”

“所以我今天才不想去了。”

“就算是为了我高兴吧，”伯纳德大喊着，哄着他，“难道你不想让我高兴吗？”

“不想。”

“你真是这么想的吗？”

“是的。”

绝望了。“我该怎么办呢？”伯纳德号叫起来。

“见鬼去吧！”里面的声音气急败坏地叫道。

“可是，今天晚上，坎特伯雷唱堂的首席歌唱家在这里呢。”伯纳德的眼泪都要出来了。

“哎呀呀塔克瓦！”只有用祖尼语，野蛮人才能充分表达自己对于这个首席歌唱家的看法。“哈尼！”他想了想，加了一句，然后还说（多么嘲讽，多么凶恶！）：“桑斯埃索嚓那！”他往地上啐了一口，就像波培会做的那样。

最后，伯纳德泄了气，不得不灰溜溜地回到房间，通知那些等得不耐烦的人，说今天晚上野蛮人不来了。听到这个消息，人们顿时义愤填膺。那些男人们很是气愤，觉得自己被欺骗了，对这个名声不好又持有异端思想的微不足道的家伙过于礼貌。他们的地位越高，恼恨越深。

“居然跟我开这种玩笑，”首席歌唱家不停地说，“跟我！”

至于那些女人，她们也非常愤慨，觉得自己上当了，让这个可怜的小人物得手了，瓶子里错误地掺入了酒精的这个家伙，这个身材跟伽马－差不多的家伙。这真是奇耻大辱，她们说，声音越来越大，伊顿的女校长尤其刻薄。

只有列宁娜一言不发。她坐在角落里，脸色苍白，蓝色的眼睛里笼罩着不常见的忧郁神情，因为和周围的人情绪迥然不同，她同他们隔离开了。她来到这个聚会时，还怀着一种奇怪的情绪，既焦急又兴奋。“再过几分钟，”她进入房间时心里想，“我就能看到他了，和他讲话，告诉他——”（她是下定了决心来的）“我喜欢他，比对我认识的任何人都喜欢。然后，他可能会说……”

他会说什么呢？血液涌上了她的脸颊。

“那天晚上，看完感官电影之后，他怎么那么奇怪呢？那么奇怪。可是，我很肯定，他非常喜欢我。我肯定……”

就在这时，伯纳德宣布了那条消息。野蛮人不来参加这个聚会了。

列宁娜突然感到了经受“强烈情感替代疗法”时的那种通常体验，那是一种可怕的空虚感，一阵让人喘不上来气的担忧，一阵恶心。她的心脏似乎停止了跳动。

“也许是因为他不喜欢我。”她心里想。这种可能性立刻转变成既定事实：约翰拒绝来，是因为他不喜欢她。他不喜欢她……

“这真是有点太蠢了，”伊顿的女校长对火葬与磷回收中心主任说，“我还想着真能……”

“是的，”范妮·克朗的声音传来，“关于酒精的说法绝对是真的。我的一个朋友认识一个当时在胚胎库工作的人。她对我的朋友说的，我的朋友又告诉了我……”

“太糟糕了，太糟糕了。”亨利·福斯特说，非常同情那个首席歌唱家，“你可能对这个感兴趣，我们的前主任差一点就要把他调到冰岛去了。”

大家说的每一句话都深深地刺伤了伯纳德，他那本来开心的、密封的自信心气球开始变得伤痕累累，逐渐漏气。他脸色苍白，神情凄切，忧心如焚，焦虑不安。他在客人中间穿梭不迭，磕磕巴巴地说着含混不清的道歉话，并向他们保证下一次野蛮人肯定会来，乞求他们坐下，吃块胡萝卜素三明治，吃一片维他命A小面饼，或者喝一杯代香槟。于是，他们吃了，喝了，可是依然对他视若无睹，要么当着他的面就出言不逊，要么在他背后议论纷纷，声音很大，很不客气，就好像他不在场一样。

“现在，我的朋友们，”坎特伯雷唱堂的首席歌唱家说，声音悦耳洪亮，一如他在福帝日庆祝中领唱时那样，“现在，我的朋友们，我想已经是时候了……”他站了起来，放下杯子，从紫红色的黏胶马甲上掸掉点心碎屑，向门口走去。

伯纳德冲向前，想拦住他。

“您一定要走吗，首席歌唱家先生？……还很早呢。我本来希望您会……”

是啊，当列宁娜悄悄告诉他，如果首席歌唱家受到邀请，他将很乐意前来时，他曾抱有多少希望啊。“他真的非常可爱，你知道的。”列宁娜还给伯纳德看了看一个小小的T字形状的金色拉链头，那是首席歌唱家送给她的，为了纪念他们在兰贝斯一起度过的周末。“来觐见坎特伯雷唱堂的首席歌唱家和野蛮人先生。”伯纳德在每一张邀请函上都得意地印上了这一大成果。可是，野蛮人偏偏选了今天晚上把自己锁在房间里，大喊“哈尼！”甚至（幸好伯纳德不懂祖尼语）“桑斯埃索嚓那！”。现在本来应该是伯纳德生涯中的一大辉煌时刻，没想到却成了他生命中耻辱最深的时刻。

“我本来非常希望……”他磕磕巴巴地说了一遍又一遍，抬头望着那个大人物，眼神里满是央求，一副心烦意乱的样子。

“我的年轻朋友，”首席歌唱家的声音洪亮而严厉，周围一片寂静，“我给你一点建议吧，”他对着伯纳德摇了摇手指头，“在一切都还来得及的时候，给你一点建议。”（他的声音变得很阴沉。）“改过自新吧，年轻的朋友，改过自新。”他在伯纳德头上划了个T字，转过身去。“列宁娜，亲爱的，”他用另一种语气说，“跟我来。”

列宁娜顺从地跟在他身后，走出房间，可脸上没有一丝笑意，也不带丝毫得意之色（对这个莫大的荣誉完全无动于衷）。其他客人恭恭敬敬地稍作等候，也跟着出去了。走在最后的人砰的一声把门关上了。只剩下伯纳德一个人。

伯纳德的自尊心的气球被戳破了，完全泄了气，他一下子跌坐在椅子上，用手蒙住脸，开始哭泣。可是，过了一会儿，他又停住了，掏出了四片唆麻。




在楼上的房间里，野蛮人正在读《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。




列宁娜和首席歌唱家步出飞机，走上兰贝斯宫的楼顶。“快点，我的年轻朋友，我是说，列宁娜。”首席歌唱家在电梯门口不耐烦地叫着她。列宁娜逗留了一会儿，想看一眼月亮。她垂下眼帘，匆匆走过楼顶，来到他身边。




“生物学之新理论”，这是穆斯塔法·蒙德刚刚读完的一篇论文的题目。他坐在那里，皱着眉头沉思了片刻，之后，他拿起了笔，在扉页上写道：“作者以数学理论处理目标概念，非常新颖，非常有创意，但却是旁门左道，从现今社会秩序的角度来看，非常危险，具有潜在的颠覆性。不予发表。”他在这句话下面划了一道线，“对作者进行密切监视。有必要将他调往圣赫勒拿岛的海洋生物站。”有点可惜，他签名时想。这是一篇非常高明的文章。可是，一旦在目标问题上允许其他解释，唉，简直不能预测会出现什么结果。这种想法可能很容易就破坏了那些较为不稳定的高种姓人群头脑中的条件设置，让他们不再相信幸福等同于最高的善这一信念，而是开始相信，目标存在于幸福之外，超出目前人类的领域，生命的目标不在于维持安乐状态，而是增强和完善意识、拓展知识。这很可能是对的，控制官思考着。但是，在目前的情况下，是不允许的。他又拿起笔，在“不予发表”下面又画了一条线，比第一道更粗更黑，然后，他叹了口气，心里想：“如果不必总是想着幸福，那该多有趣啊！”




约翰的眼睛闭着，脸上闪着狂喜的光，他正对着虚空柔情蜜意地念着：

“啊！火炬远不及她的明亮；

她皎然悬在暮天的颊上，

像黑奴耳边璀璨的珠环；

她是天上明珠降落人间……”(1)

金色的T字挂在列宁娜的胸前，亮闪闪的，首席歌唱家闹着玩般地把它抓在手里，又闹着玩般地拉着，拽着。“我想，”列宁娜突然说，打破了长时间的沉默，“我最好吃一两克唆麻。”




此时，伯纳德早已酣然入睡，在梦境中的私人天堂里，他微笑着，微笑着，微笑着。但不可改变的是，每过三十秒，床上方的电子钟的分针就咔嗒一声，往前跳一步，声音轻微得几乎听不见，咔嗒，咔嗒，咔嗒，咔嗒……于是，早晨到来了。伯纳德又返回到此时此地的痛苦中。他怀着最低沉的情绪，乘坐出租飞机来到训练中心上班。成功带来的陶醉感已经烟消云散，他清醒了，变回了那个过去的自我。同过去几周那个短暂的气球相比，这个过去的自我在周围的氛围中显得前所未有地沉重。

对这个泄了气的伯纳德，野蛮人颇为同情，这倒是出乎他的预料。

“你更像在玛尔帕斯的时候了。”当伯纳德对他讲了聚会上的伤心事，野蛮人说，“你还记得我们俩第一次谈话的时候吗？在小房子的外面。你就和那个时候一样。”

“因为我又不开心了，这就是原因。”

“嗯，我倒是宁愿不开心，也不要你以前那种虚假的开心。”

“我喜欢那个。”伯纳德恨恨地说，“你是造成这一切的原因。拒绝来我的聚会，让他们都反对我了！”他知道他现在这么说话不公平，也很荒唐。他内心也承认，最后甚至也大声承认了，野蛮人说的话是有道理的，那些有一丁点理由就反目成仇的朋友根本一文不值。不过，尽管伯纳德明白这些，尽管他这个朋友的支持和同情是他目前唯一的安慰，尽管他对野蛮人的态度中还有真心的喜爱，但他私下里仍然怀有怨恨之情，并思考着如何对他实施一些小小的报复。对首席歌唱家抱有怨恨是毫无用处的，也根本没有报复装瓶室主任或命运预定室主任助理的可能性。对伯纳德来说，作为报复对象，野蛮人拥有其他人没有的巨大优势：他近在咫尺。朋友的一个主要功能就是吃点苦头（以温和的、象征性的方式），吃点我们愿意但却没有能力让我们的敌人吃的苦头。

伯纳德的另一个报复对象兼朋友是赫尔姆霍茨。当他窘迫不安地来到后者的身边，寻求他在发达时认为不再值得保持的友谊时，赫尔姆霍茨给了他友谊，毫无抱怨、不加评论地给了他友谊，好像他已经忘记二人之间曾有争吵。伯纳德既感动，又觉得这种慷慨大度是对自己的羞辱。这种慷慨大度根本不是唆麻的功劳，而完全是赫尔姆霍茨的性格使然，因此就益发显得不同寻常，益发令他感到羞辱。是日常生活中的赫尔姆霍茨，而不是吃了半克唆麻在度假中的赫尔姆霍茨，忘却了，原谅了。伯纳德因此心怀感激（再次拥有这个朋友真是一大安慰），却也因此心怀怨恨（如果能够报复一下赫尔姆霍茨的大度该有多么痛快）。

在他们关系疏远之后的第一次会面中，伯纳德对他倾诉了自己的悲惨遭遇，也得到了安慰。几天之后，他才得知，遇到麻烦的人不只是他自己，这令他既吃惊又有点羞愧。赫尔姆霍茨也和当局之间产生了矛盾。

“是因为一些顺口溜，”他解释道，“我正在给三年级的学生上我的高级情感工程课。一共有十二次课，第七课是关于顺口溜的，具体来说，就是‘关于道德宣传和广告中顺口溜的使用’。我总是用很多例子来讲解我的课。那一次，我想给他们讲讲我刚写的一首。纯粹是疯了，这是当然的，可是我就是没有抑制住这个想法。”他笑了笑，“我很好奇，想看看他们的反应如何。另外，”他更加严肃地补充，“我想做点宣传，我想让他们感受到我写诗时的那些情感。福帝！”他又笑了，“引起了多么强烈的抗议！校长把我叫过去，威胁要立即开除我。我已经是众人瞩目的人了。”

“你的顺口溜是什么样的？”伯纳德问。

“是关于孤独的。”

伯纳德的眉毛扬了起来。

“我给你背诵一下，如果你想听的话。”于是，赫尔姆霍茨背开了：

“昨日的委员会，

支离破碎，如残破的鼓，

子夜时的城市，

真空中的笛声，

合紧的嘴唇，安睡的脸，

每台停止的机器，

杂物乱扔的寂静场地，

人群曾经来来去去——

所有的静寂都在欢呼，

或者哭泣（高声或者低语），

说出来吧，以那种

我所不知的嗓音。



苏珊的缺席，

或者，爱杰莉亚，

她的手臂和各自的胸脯，

各自的嘴唇和臀，

逐渐形成了人体；

谁的？我问，

其中本质多么荒唐，

那种东西，又不似什么东西，

却会在空虚的深夜

迅速繁殖，比我们的交媾

还要真实，

为什么它看似如此污秽？

“嗯，我就拿这个作为例子，然后，学生们报告给校长了。”

“我一点也不吃惊，”伯纳德说，“这和他们睡眠教育的内容是完全背道而驰的。记住，他们已经接受过至少二十五万次针对孤独的警告了。”

“我知道，可是，我当时想看看效果究竟会怎么样。”

“嗯，你现在看到了。”

赫尔姆霍茨只是笑了笑。“我感到，”沉默了一会儿后，他说，“好像我刚刚找到了可以写作的东西，好像我刚刚有能力利用我身体内部的那种力量，那种额外的、潜在的力量。好像我身上有什么事情发生了。”伯纳德想，尽管他遭遇了麻烦，但他看起来却非常快乐。

赫尔姆霍茨和野蛮人一见如故。他们两个的关系是那么融洽，伯纳德甚至都感觉到一阵强烈的嫉妒。在过去的那些星期里，他从来没有和野蛮人达到那么亲密的程度，赫尔姆霍茨却立刻做到了。看着他们两个，听着他们的谈话，他发现自己有时候在怨恨，希望当初没有把他们两个人介绍给对方。他为自己的嫉妒感到羞愧，有时会努力靠自己的意志力战胜嫉妒，间或也吃点唆麻来逃避这种嫉妒。可是意志力不太成功；而在唆麻假期之间总是会有间隔的，所以这种可怕的情绪还是会不断出现。

赫尔姆霍茨第三次和野蛮人会面时，朗诵了那首关于孤独的顺口溜。

“你觉得怎么样？”朗诵完之后，他问。

野蛮人摇摇头。“你听听这个。”他回答。他打开收藏那本老鼠啃过的书的抽屉，翻开书，开始读：

“让最激越的鸟儿栖息，

在阿拉伯孤独的树上，

请它做先驱和号角……”(2)

赫尔姆霍茨听得越来越激动。听到“阿拉伯孤独的树”时，他吓了一跳；听到“你这嘶叫的使者”时，他突然开心地微笑了；听到“一切霸道的翅膀”时，血液涌上了他的双颊；但是，听到“死亡之歌”时，他的脸变得煞白，因为某种前所未有的情感而颤抖。野蛮人继续朗读着：

“物性变得离奇，

己身已非原身。

同质而有异名，

既非叫一，也非称二。



理智已变得迷惑，

眼见是分，却又合一……”

“狂欢吧！”伯纳德说，用他刺耳的大笑打断了野蛮人的阅读，“这只不过是一首团结仪式上的赞美诗嘛。”他在报复他的两个朋友，因为他们彼此的喜欢程度已经超过他们对他自己的喜欢。

在接下来的两三次会面中，他经常重复这种小小的报复行为。这很简单，因为赫尔姆霍茨和野蛮人都会因为最喜爱的水晶般的诗歌被打断和亵渎而感到痛苦万分，这报复也很奏效。最后，赫尔姆霍茨威胁说，如果他再敢打搅他们的话，就把他从房间里踢出去。可是，奇怪的是，下一次的打断，也是最不光彩的一次，却是来自赫尔姆霍茨本人。

野蛮人正在大声朗读《罗密欧与朱丽叶》，带着强烈而颤抖的激情朗读着（在此过程中，他一直把自己看成罗密欧，把列宁娜看成朱丽叶）。赫尔姆霍茨聆听着这对情侣第一次会面的那场戏，既感兴趣，又迷惑不解。果园一场戏中的诗意令他非常开心，可是戏中表达的情感却令他发笑。因为想要一个女孩而让自己陷入如此境地，这简直太荒唐了。不过，仅从文字的细节来看，真是无与伦比的情感工程文章啊！“那个老家伙，”他说，“他让我们最好的宣传技术员相形见绌啊。”野蛮人得意地笑笑，继续他的朗读。一切都还比较顺利，直到第三幕的最后一场，凯普莱特和凯普莱特夫人开始强迫朱丽叶嫁给帕里斯。在这一整场戏中，赫尔姆霍茨都坐立不安，可是，当野蛮人可怜巴巴地模仿着朱丽叶喊出：

“天知道我心里是多么难过，

难道它竟会不给我一点慈悲吗？

啊，我亲爱的妈妈！不要丢弃我！

把这门亲事延期一个月或是一个星期也好；

或者要是您不答应我，那么请您把我的新床

安放在提伯尔特长眠的幽暗坟茔里吧！”(3)

当朱丽叶说完这些之后，赫尔姆霍茨难以自抑地爆发出一阵哈哈怪笑。

妈妈和爸爸（可怕的污言秽语）逼迫女儿要她不想要的人！那个白痴女孩居然不说明自己正在和一个更喜欢的人（至少在当时）在一起！这种情景是那么荒唐、那么淫秽，让人不得不觉得滑稽之极。他一直在努力，试图抑制住内心不断涌上来的笑意，可是，“亲爱的妈妈”（野蛮人那因痛苦而颤抖的语调），以及提伯尔特的长眠，很明显他并没有被火化，而是在昏暗的坟墓里把磷白白浪费掉，这些都令他难以控制住自己。他哈哈大笑，直笑得眼泪顺着脸颊流下来，笑得几乎不能停歇，而野蛮人呢，他的脸因为愤慨而变得苍白，他从书上抬起头来，看看他，然后，看到他依然在哈哈大笑，愤愤地把书合上，站起来，带着一副对牛弹琴的神气，把书锁在了抽屉里。

“不过，”赫尔姆霍茨终于喘了口气来道歉，他安抚着野蛮人听他解释，“我非常清楚，人们需要这样荒唐而疯狂的场景，因为写任何别的东西都写不太好。那个老家伙为什么是个那么高明的宣传技术员呢？因为他有很多疯癫的、令人痛苦的东西，可以叫人激动万分啊。你得受到伤害，烦恼不安，否则你不会想出那些真正美妙的、像X光般能把人刺穿的句子。可是爸爸和妈妈！”他摇摇头，“你不可能指望我在听到这些称呼时还能一本正经地绷着个脸。还有，谁又会因为一个男孩和一个女孩在不在一起而激动万分呢？”（野蛮人一阵畏缩，不过，赫尔姆霍茨正在若有所思地盯着地板，并没有看见。）“不，”他叹了口气，总结道，“这样是不行的。我们需要其他类型的疯狂和暴力。可是，什么样的呢？什么样的呢？从哪里找得到呢？”他沉默了，然后再次摇了摇头，“我不知道，”他最后说，“我不知道。”

第十三章


亨利·福斯特从胚胎库的昏暗中露出身影。

“今晚想去看感官电影吗？”

列宁娜摇摇头，一言未发。

“和别人一起出去吗？”他对哪一个朋友正在和谁在一起非常感兴趣。“是本尼托吗？”他问。

她又摇了摇头。

亨利觉察到了那双紫色眼睛里的疲倦，在红斑狼疮色的光线下，她的脸色透着苍白，她那毫无笑意的、鲜红的嘴角流露出了悲哀。“你不是生病了吧，是不是？”他有点担心地问，害怕她可能染上了为数不多的几种传染病之一。

可是，列宁娜又一次摇了摇头。

“不管怎样，你都应该去看看医生。”亨利说，“每天看医生，焦虑不进门。”他热情地说，同时拍拍她的肩膀，让那睡眠教育中的格言更深地为她所领会。“也许你需要代妊娠疗法，”他提出建议，“或者是超强的强烈情感替代疗法。有时候，你知道的，通常的那种激情替代品不够……”

“哦，看在福帝的分上！”列宁娜说，打破了刚才她固执的沉默，“闭嘴！”她扭头去处理被冷落了的胚胎。

强烈情感替代疗法！真是的！如果她不是几乎就要哭出来的话，都差点要笑了。好像她现在还没有体会到足够强烈的感情似的！她一边重新注满针管，一边深深地叹了口气。“约翰，”她喃喃自语，“约翰……”然后，“我的福帝，”她纳闷，“我刚才给这个注射昏睡病疫苗了吗？有还是没有？”她根本记不起来了。最终，她决定不去冒给它注射第二针的危险，于是沿着传送带来到下一个瓶子前面。

二十二年八个月零四天之后的这个时辰，姆万扎-姆万扎的一个年轻有为的阿尔法－行政长官将死于昏睡病，这将是半个多世纪以来的第一个病例。列宁娜叹着气，继续自己的工作。

一个小时之后，在更衣室里，范妮正在情绪激烈地反驳着：“你竟然让自己陷入这样的境地，真是够荒唐的。太荒唐了，”她重复了一遍，“为了什么呢？不过是个男人，一个男人。”

“可他才是我想要的。”

“好像这世界上没有数以百万计的其他男人似的。”

“可我不想要他们。”

“你不试试怎么会知道？”

“我试过了。”

“试了多少？”范妮问，鄙夷地耸了耸肩。“一个，还是两个？”

“十几个呢。可是，”她摇摇头，“那没有用的。”她说。

“嗯，那你必须坚持试下去。”范妮像在引用格言一般简洁地说。但是，很明显，她对自己所开处方的信心已经有所动摇。“做事不持之以恒，你将一事无成。”

“可是，同时呢……”

“别再想他了。”

“我忍不住。”

“那就吃点唆麻。”

“我吃了。”

“嗯，那就继续吃。”

“可是，在唆麻假期的间隔里，我仍然喜欢他。我会永远喜欢他。”

“那么，如果是那样的话，”范妮决然地说，“你干吗不直接去找他，要了他。不管他想不想这么做。”

“可是，你不知道他有多么奇怪呀！”

“那就更有理由采取果断的行动。”

“说起来容易啊。”

“不要忍受那些废话了。行动起来。”范妮的声音就像号角，她好比是福帝女青年协会的讲师，晚上正在给贝塔－青少年们做讲座，“是的，立刻行动起来。现在就做。”

“我会吓坏的。”列宁娜说。

“那么，你只需先吃半克唆麻。现在，我要去洗澡了。”她大步流星地走了，毛巾拖在身后。




门铃响了，野蛮人跳了起来，跑向门口。他正在焦急地盼望着赫尔姆霍茨这天下午来（因为他最终下定了决心，向赫尔姆霍茨谈谈列宁娜，他一刻也不能延迟自己的倾诉了）。

“我有预感，赫尔姆霍茨，是你来了。”他一边开门，一边喊。

门槛外边，列宁娜站在那里，她穿着一套白色黏胶绸的水手服，一顶白色的圆帽子俏皮地斜戴在左耳上。

“啊！”野蛮人说，好像有人刚刚给了他沉重的一击。

半克唆麻就足以让列宁娜忘记自己的恐惧和尴尬。“你好，约翰。”她微笑着说，走过他身边，进入房间。他机械地关上门，跟着她走了进去。列宁娜坐下了。一阵长长的沉默。

“你见到我好像不太高兴，约翰。”列宁娜终于说话了。

“不高兴？”野蛮人眼含责怪地看着她。突然，他双膝跪倒在列宁娜面前，抓起她的手，满怀崇拜地亲吻着。“不高兴？哦，但愿你知道，”他声音低低地说，鼓足勇气抬眼看着她，“我亲爱的列宁娜，”他继续说，“最最亲爱的，世界上最宝贵的。”她温柔地对着他微笑。“哦，你是那么完美，”（她身体向前倾着，双唇微张）“那么完美，是那么举世闻名的创造物，”（越来越近）“是所有创造物中最珍贵的。”(1)更近了。野蛮人突然挣扎着站了起来。“这也正是，”他别过脸去，说，“这就是我要先做点什么的原因……我是说，来证明我是配得上你的。我自然是永远配不上你的。但是，无论如何，我要证明我并非绝对配不上。我想做点什么。”

“你为什么觉得有必要……”列宁娜开口说，但说到半截又停住了。她的声音里透出一丝恼火。你已经向前探出身子，离他越来越近，嘴唇张开，可是，突然，他这个笨蛋却站了起来，让你靠了个空，唉，即使有半克唆麻在你的血液里流淌着，这也是够让人恼火的理由啊。

“在玛尔帕斯，”野蛮人正语无伦次、含混不清地说着，“你必须给她带来山狮的毛皮，我是说，你想跟她结婚的话。或者一只狼。”

“在英格兰没有狮子。”列宁娜几乎在怒喝了。

“即使有，”野蛮人突然生出一股轻蔑和怨恨，补充道，“我想人们也是从直升机里杀死它们的吧，用毒气什么的。列宁娜，我不会那么做的。”他挺了挺胸，鼓足勇气看看列宁娜，可是列宁娜却恼火地、不解地盯着他。他糊涂了。“我会做任何事情，”他继续说，更加结结巴巴，“你让我做的任何事。你知道，有一类活动是很吃力的，但兴趣会使人忘记辛苦。(2)这就是我的感觉。我是说，如果你让我去的话，我甚至会去打扫地板。”

“可是，我们这里有真空吸尘器啊，”列宁娜不解地说，“没有必要扫地。”

“没有，当然没有必要。但是，有一类卑微的工作是要怀着崇高的精神去做的。(3)我想要经历崇高的事情。你不明白吗？”

“可如果有真空吸尘器……”

“那不是问题所在。”

“有艾普西隆半白痴操作吸尘器，”她继续说，“可是，说真的，为什么呢？”

“为什么？为了你呀，为了你。为了证明我……”

“可真空吸尘器与狮子到底有什么关系……”

“来证明我是多么……”

“或者说，狮子同你高兴见到我之间又有什么……”她越来越气急败坏了。

“我是多么爱你，列宁娜。”他几乎绝望地脱口而出。

血液一下子涌上列宁娜的两颊，一股突如其来的得意的暖流令她心旌荡漾。“你是认真的吗，约翰？”

“我本来不想说出来的，”野蛮人喊，两只手痛苦地抓在一起，“一直不说，直到……听着，列宁娜，在玛尔帕斯，人们是要结婚的。”

“结什么？”她的声音里再次流露出恼怒之意。他现在到底在说些什么呀？

“永远在一起。他们发誓永远生活在一起。”

“多么可怕的想法！”列宁娜真的惊呆了。

“永远美好的灵魂不会随着美丽的外表同归衰谢。”(4)

“什么？”

“在莎士比亚作品里也是一样。‘但在一切神圣的仪式没有充分给你许可之前，你不能侵犯她处女的尊严’……”(5)

“看在福帝的分上，约翰，说点正经话吧。你说的话我一个字也听不懂。首先，你提到真空吸尘器，然后又是处女尊严什么的。你快把我逼疯了。”她跳了起来，好像既怕他的心神离她而去，又怕他的肉身也会跑掉一样，抓住了他的手腕，“回答我的问题：你是喜欢我，还是不喜欢我？”

片刻的沉默，然后，以低低的耳语声，他说：“我爱你胜过世上的一切。”

“那你为什么不早点说出来呢？”她喊道，她是那么恼火，尖锐的手指甲深深地抠入了他手腕的皮肤，“可你却唠唠叨叨地说什么处女尊严、真空吸尘器或者狮子什么的，让我几星期以来都那么痛苦。”

她松开了他的手，生气地把它甩到一边。

“如果我不是这么喜欢你的话，”她说，“我都要生你的气了。”

突然，她的双臂搂住了他的脖子，他感到她的嘴唇轻轻贴上了自己的嘴唇。那么柔软，那么温暖，又像是带了电一样酥麻，让他不自觉想起了《直升机里的三星期》里面的那种拥抱。哦！哦！那个立体的金发女郎，啊！那个无比真实的黑人。恐怖，恐怖，恐怖……他试图挣脱，可是列宁娜搂得更紧了。

“你为什么不早说呢？”她低语，她抬起脸来望着他，眼神既温柔，又含着一丝责怪。

“即使在最幽冥的暗室中，在最方便的场合，”（良心带着诗意訇然作响）“有伺隙而来的魔鬼的最强烈的煽惑，也不能使我的廉耻化为肉欲。(6)绝不，绝不！”他决心已定。

“你这个傻瓜！”她正在说，“我那么想要你。如果你也想要我，干吗不……”

“可是，列宁娜……”他开始反对。她马上把双臂松开，退后了几步。有那么一会儿，他还以为她接受了他没说出来的暗示呢。可是，当她解开白色的漆皮带，把它小心地挂在椅子背上时，他开始怀疑自己是否想错了。

“列宁娜！”他担心地又重复了一遍。

她将手放在脖子下面，垂直向下长长地一拉，她的白色水手服的衬衫就开到了底边。怀疑逐渐凝固成了彻底坚实的肯定。“列宁娜，你在干什么？”

唰！唰！她的回答是无言的。她从喇叭裤中迈出来。带拉链的内衣是淡淡的贝壳般的粉色。首席歌唱家给的金色T字挂在两乳之间。

“这些透过窗棂逼视着男人眼睛的乳峰……”(7)这些唱歌般的、如雷贯耳的、有魔力的词语让她似乎变得双倍危险，也双倍诱人。柔软，多么柔软，可是又多么具有穿透力！钻啊，碾啊，直刺入人的理智，洞穿了人的决心。“血液中的火焰一旦燃烧起来，最坚强的誓言也就等于干草。更加节制吧，否则……”(8)

唰！圆圆的粉色内衣分为两半，犹如切得干净利落的苹果。扭动一下胳膊，先抬起右脚，再抬起左脚，拉链内衣就躺在地上了，有如泄了气的球，失去了生命。

列宁娜还穿着鞋子和袜子，斜戴着圆帽子，她走向他。“亲爱的，亲爱的！真希望你早点这么说！”她张开双臂。

可是，野蛮人并没有同样张开双臂，没有说“亲爱的！”，相反，他吓得连连倒退，对她挥舞着双手，好像试图赶走什么入侵的危险动物。退后四步之后，他被迫停靠在了墙边。

“我的亲亲！”列宁娜说，把双手放在他的肩膀上，身体紧紧地压着他。“抱住我，”她命令道，“抱紧我，让我迷醉，亲爱的。”她也知道一些诗句，一些魔法般的词语，犹如唱歌，犹如鼓点。“亲吻我，”她闭上了眼睛，让自己的声音渐渐降下去，犹如睡梦中的呓语，“亲吻我，直到我沉醉。抱紧我，亲爱的，温柔地……”

野蛮人抓住她的手腕，把她的手从自己的肩膀上掰开，粗鲁地把她推到几尺开外。

“嗷，你把我弄疼了，你……哦！”她突然不作声了。恐惧让她忘掉了疼痛。她睁开眼睛，看到了他的脸——不，不是他的脸，而是某个凶狠的陌生人的脸，苍白，扭曲，因为某种疯狂的、不明原因的狂怒而抽搐着。她吓得目瞪口呆。“怎么了，约翰？”她轻声问。他没有回答，而是用那种狂乱的眼神瞪着她。抓着她手腕的双手在颤抖。他大口喘着气，呼吸时缓时急。突然，她听到他咬牙切齿的声音，微弱到几乎听不见，但是非常吓人。“怎么了？”她几乎尖叫出来。

他好像突然被她的叫声惊醒一样，抓住她的肩膀，摇晃着她。“婊子！”他大喊，“婊子！不要脸的娼妇！(9)”

“哦，不要，不——不要，”她抗议道，因为他的摇晃，她的声音古怪地颤抖着。

“婊子！”

“求——求你了。”

“该死的婊子！”

“一克——克唆麻胜过——过……”她说。

野蛮人把她狠狠地推开，她踉跄着跌倒了。“滚，”他大喊，俯瞰着她，咄咄逼人，“从我眼前滚开，否则我会杀了你。”他攥紧了拳头。

列宁娜抬起胳膊，护住自己的脸。“不要，请不要，约翰……”

“快点！快！”

列宁娜仍然举着一只胳膊，眼含恐惧地看着他的每一个举动。她爬起来，依然弓着腰，依然护着头，冲向了浴室。

一声响亮的“啪”加快了她逃跑的步伐，那声音如同手枪。

“嗷！”她向前一蹿。

她把自己安全地锁在浴室里，现在有时间可以检视一下自己的伤了。她背着身子站在镜子前，转过头去看。在左肩上，在珍珠粉色的皮肤上，她可以看到一枚清晰的紫红色的巴掌印，她小心地揉了揉受伤的部位。

在浴室外边，在另一个房间里，野蛮人正在来来回回地踱着步，大步流星，脚步伴随着那些神奇字眼的鼓点和节奏：“小鸟儿都在干那把戏，金苍蝇当着我的面也会公然交合。”这些话在他的耳边訇然作响，令他疯狂。“其实她自己干起那回事来，比臭猫和骚马还要浪得多哩。她们的上半身虽然是女人，下半身却是淫荡的妖怪；腰带以上是属于天神的，腰带以下全是属于魔鬼的：那儿是地狱，那儿是黑暗，那儿是火坑，吐着熊熊的烈焰，发出熏人的恶臭，把一切烧成了灰。啐！啐！啐！呸！呸！好掌柜，给我称一两麝香，让我解解我的想象中的臭气。”(10)

“约翰！”从浴室里传来一声细细的讨好的声音，“约翰！”

“你这野草闲花啊！你的颜色是这样娇美，你的香气是这样芬芳，人家看见你嗅到你就会心疼。这一本美丽的书册，是要让人家写上‘娼妓’两个字的吗？天神见了它要掩鼻而过……”(11)

可是她的香气还留在他的身上，他的衣服上还沾着那种涂抹过她天鹅绒般肌肤的香粉。“不要脸的娼妇，不要脸的娼妇，不要脸的娼妇。”无情的节奏自然而然地敲打出来，“不要脸的……”

“约翰，你能把我的衣服递给我吗？”

他捡起喇叭裤、衬衫、拉链内衣。

“打开门！”他命令，用脚踢门。

“不，我不开。”受了惊吓的声音在反抗。

“那你指望我怎么把衣服递给你呢？”

“从门上边的通气口塞过来。”

他照她说的做了，又重新开始在房间里不安地踱步。“不要脸的娼妇，不要脸的娼妇。那个屁股胖胖的、手指粗得像马铃薯般的荒淫的魔鬼(12)……”

“约翰。”

他不愿回答。“屁股胖胖的、手指粗得像马铃薯。”

“约翰。”

“什么事？”他粗声问。

“我在想，你能否把我的马尔萨斯腰带拿给我？”

列宁娜坐在那儿，聆听着外边房间里的脚步声，同时，她心里在想：他那样走来走去，还要走多久呢？她是否应该等他离开公寓呢？或者，等他那疯狂劲消停之后，如果安全，再打开浴室门，冲出去呢？

这时，外面房间的电话铃响了，打断了她惴惴不安的推测。外面的脚步声戛然而止。她听到野蛮人与听不见声音的人在交谈。

“你好。”

……

“是的。”

……

“如果我没有冒充的话，我就是。(13)”

……

“是的，你没有听见我说的话吗？我就是野蛮人先生。”

……

“什么？谁病了？我当然感兴趣了。”

……

“严重吗？她真的这么糟糕吗？我马上去……”

……

“不在她的房间了？把她带到哪里去了？”

……

“哦，天啊！地址是什么？”

……

“公园街三号，是吗？三号？谢谢。”

列宁娜听见电话听筒咔嗒一声放下了，然后是匆匆的脚步声。门砰地关上。然后房间变得静悄悄的。他真的走了吗？

她万般小心地把浴室门打开了一条缝隙，往外看了看，空无一人，她胆子大了点，把门又打开了一些，把整个脑袋伸了出去，最后，她踮着脚走入房间，停住，站了几秒，心紧张得怦怦乱跳，她听着，听着，然后，冲向前门，打开，溜过去，关上，猛跑。直到她跑到电梯里，电梯已经开始下降之后，她才终于感到自己安全了。

第十四章


公园街临终医院是一座六十层的塔楼，镶着报春花色的瓷砖。野蛮人走出出租直升机时，一队色彩斑斓的空中灵车正从楼顶呼呼地起飞，穿过公园，向西飞去，直奔斯劳火葬场。在电梯门边，门卫长告诉了他需要的信息，他乘电梯下降到位于第十七楼的八十一号病房（急速衰老病房，门卫长解释）。

这是一个宽敞的房间，洒满阳光，粉刷成黄色，里面共有二十张床，都住着人。琳达临终时是有人陪伴的，不仅有人陪伴，还享受着所有现代便利设施。空中不间断地响着欢快的合成乐曲。每张床的床脚处都摆放着一台电视机，面对着垂危的病人。从早到晚，电视机一直是开着的，香气龙头也一直开着。每过一刻钟，房间里的香味就自动变换。“我们尽力，”在门口负责接待野蛮人的护士解释道，“我们尽力创造一个完全令人愉悦的氛围，就是介于一等宾馆与感官电影院之间的一个场所，如果你明白我的意思的话。”

“她在哪儿呢？”野蛮人没有理会这些客气的解释，问道。

护士有点生气。“你太着急了。”她说。

“还有希望吗？”他问。

“你是说，她不死的希望？”（他点点头。）“没有，当然没有了。如果人被送到这里，就没有一点……”他苍白的脸上的悲伤表情吓了她一跳，她突然停住了，“怎么了，你到底怎么了？”她问。她不习惯客人出现这种情况。（反正这里也没有多少客人，也没有理由会有很多客人。）“你感觉不舒服吗？”

他摇摇头。“她是我的妈妈。”他说话的声音低得几乎听不见。

护士看了他一眼，眼睛里满是惊讶与恐惧，然后眼神迅速地看向别处。她的脸火辣辣的，羞成了一团红，从额头一直红到了脖子根。

“带我去看她。”野蛮人说，尽力保持正常的语气。

护士的脸依然通红，她带着他向病房走去。他们走过去的时候，一张张依然年轻、毫无皱纹的脸（因为衰老来得太快了，脸颊还没有来得及衰老，只有心脏和大脑变老了）转向他们。处于第二个童年期的那些空洞、毫无好奇心的眼神追随着他们向前的步伐。看着这些人，野蛮人不禁打了个寒战。

琳达躺在一长排病床的最后一张上，紧贴着墙。她倚靠在一堆枕头上，正在看南美黎曼曲面网球锦标赛的半决赛，她床脚边的电视屏幕上正在无声地播放着缩小的画面。在这荧光玻璃的方形屏幕上，那些小小的人物无声地跑过来跑过去，就像鱼缸里的鱼，就像另一个世界里的居民，无声但却跃动着。

琳达在看着，脸上模模糊糊地露出似懂非懂的微笑，那张苍白浮肿的脸上带着愚钝的开心表情。她的眼帘时而会合上，似乎打了几秒钟的盹，然后，她又会突然惊醒，醒来就看那犹如鱼缸杂技一般的网球赛，倾听超级高音歌唱家吴丽策瑞娜演唱的“抱紧我，让我迷醉，亲爱的”，嗅着那从她头顶上的通风口吹过来的温暖的马鞭草香气。她醒来后会感受到这一切，或者说，她醒来后只为做一个有关这一切的梦，梦中的一切都因她血液里的唆麻而改变，变得更加诱人，她会再一次流露出那种七零八落、花容失色的微笑，显露出孩童般的满足表情。

“那我就走了，”护士说，“我还有一帮孩子要接待。另外，那个三号病人，”她指了指，“随时都可能会走。你自便吧。”她匆匆走开了。

野蛮人坐到床边上。

“琳达。”他轻轻地叫，握住了她的手。

她听到有人叫她的名字，转过脸来。认出他后，她失神的眼睛立刻明亮起来。她攥了攥他的手，笑了笑，嘴唇嚅动了一下，可是，突然，她的头向前耷拉下去。她睡着了。他坐在那里，看着她，试图透过那疲惫的躯体，找寻那张在玛尔帕斯时低着头凝望他的年轻明媚的脸，回忆着（他闭上了眼睛）她的声音，她的一举一动，以及他们一起度过的日子。“链球菌马儿来到班布里T……”她唱歌的声音真美！那些童谣，多么奇妙，多么神秘！

A，B，C，维他命D，

脂肪在肝里，鳕鱼在海里。

他回忆起琳达反复吟唱的这些歌词，还有她的声音，他感到，温热的泪水正从他眼帘的后面涌上来。还有那些阅读课：“婴儿在瓶里，猫儿在垫上”，以及《胚胎库贝塔工作人员实用指南》。那些火炉边的漫长夜晚，或者，如果是夏天，就在小房子的房顶上，她会给他讲述“那个地方”的故事，在保留地之外，那个美丽的、美丽的地方。关于那些故事的记忆，犹如天堂，犹如善和美的乐园，他仍然完好无缺地保留着，一尘不染，没有因为接触到了真实的伦敦以及那些真实的文明世界的男男女女而有所玷污。

一阵尖厉的嗓音突然传来，他睁开了眼睛，匆匆擦掉眼泪之后，他转过身。一列长得看不到头的多胞胎男孩正在涌入房间，全部是一模一样的八岁男孩。一个接一个，一个接一个，他们进来了，简直是个梦魇。他们的脸，不断重复的脸，因为那么多人却只有一张脸，像哈巴狗一样瞪着眼睛，看上去到处是鼻孔和灰色的鼓眼睛。他们都穿着卡其色衣服，全都大张着嘴巴。他们叽叽喳喳地说着话，走进来了。不一会儿，病房里就全是这些孩子，像蛆虫一样。他们簇拥在病床之间，有的爬上床去，有的钻下床去，有的瞅瞅电视机，有的则对着病人做做鬼脸。

琳达让他们大吃一惊，或者说，让他们惊慌失措。有一群孩子很快聚集在她的床脚边，盯着她，眼睛里流露出动物突然遭遇未知事物时的那种恐惧、愚钝的好奇。

“哦，看，快看！”他们低声说，声音里充满了恐惧，“她到底怎么了？她为什么这么胖？”

他们从来没有见过她这样的脸，他们见过的脸都是年轻紧致的，见过的身体都是苗条挺拔的。那些六十多岁就要垂死的老人看起来也像幼稚的小姑娘。可是，相比之下，四十四岁的琳达看起来却像个老怪物，皮肤松弛扭曲。

“她多可怕呀，是吧？”他们低声评论着，“看看她的牙齿！”

突然，一个长着哈巴狗脸的孩子从床底下钻出来，出现在约翰的椅子和墙壁之间，盯着琳达熟睡的脸看。

“我说……”他的话还没有说完，声音就变成了一声惨叫。野蛮人抓住了他的衣领，把他提到椅子上方，利落地打了他两记耳光，孩子号叫着走了。

听到他的哭嚎，护士长匆匆跑过来救他。

“你把他怎么了？”她凶狠地问，“我不许你打孩子们。”

“好吧，那就别让他们来这张床旁边。”野蛮人的声音因愤慨而颤抖，“那些污秽的小杂种在这里干什么？真是丢脸！”

“丢脸？你什么意思？他们在经受死亡条件训练。我告诉你，”她气势汹汹地警告他，“如果我再发现你干扰他们的条件训练，我就把门卫们叫进来，把你轰出去。”

野蛮人站起身来，冲着她迈了两三步。他的举动和他脸上的表情是那么危险，吓得护士直往后退。他努力地抑制住了自己，一声不吭地转过身，再次坐回到了床边。

护士感到安全了，虽然声音有点太尖了，听着也不太有把握，她还是不无尊严地说：“我警告过你了。你小心点。”她还是把那些过分好奇的孩子带走了，让他们去玩找拉链游戏，她的一个同事正在房间的另一头组织孩子们玩这个游戏。

“赶快去喝你的那杯咖啡因饮料吧，亲爱的。”她对那个护士说。行使权力恢复了她的自信，让她感觉好多了。“好了，孩子们！”她喊道。

琳达不舒服地动了动，眼睛睁开了一会儿，模模糊糊地向四周看了看，又一次睡着了。野蛮人坐在她旁边，尽力想重新捕捉刚才的那种心境。“A，B，C，维他命D。”他念叨着，好像这些词是能够令人起死回生的咒语。可是，这咒语却毫无效果。那些美丽的回忆顽固地拒绝重现，涌入他的恨恨的回忆的只有嫉妒、丑陋和痛苦。肩膀受伤流血的波培，睡相难看的琳达，洒在床边地板上的麦斯卡尔酒周围嗡嗡叫着的苍蝇，她走过时咒骂她的孩子们……啊，不，不！他闭上了眼睛，使劲摇了摇头，努力地拒绝着那些回忆。“A，B，C，维他命D……”他努力去回想，他坐在她的双膝上，她搂着他唱歌时的情景，一遍又一遍地唱，边唱边摇着他，摇着他进入梦乡：“A，B，C，维他命D，维他命D，维他命D……”

超级高音歌唱家吴丽策瑞娜的声音逐渐升高，达到了哭泣般的高度；突然，在香气循环系统里，马鞭草的香味换成了浓郁的广藿香气。琳达动了一下，醒来了，迷糊地盯了那些打半决赛的网球运动员几秒钟，抬起脸，嗅了嗅空气中新换的香味，突然微微一笑，是那种孩童般的狂喜的微笑。

“波培！”她喃喃自语，闭上了眼睛，“哦，我真喜欢这样，真的……”她叹了口气，再次陷入枕头。

“可是，琳达！”野蛮人乞求似的说，“难道你不认识我了吗？”他是那么尽力，已经尽了最大的力，为什么她不让他忘却这些事情呢？他几乎是用暴力攥了攥她那软绵绵的手，似乎想逼迫她从这个淫荡的肉欲之梦中醒来，从这些卑贱可憎的回忆中走出来，回到现在，回到现实——这个可怕的现实，这个糟糕的现实，可这个现实毕竟是崇高的，是重要的，恰恰因为那即将到来的、令他们恐惧的死亡这个事实，这个现实是那么令人绝望地重要。“难道你不认识我了吗，琳达？”

他感到她的手在微弱地回应。眼泪涌上了他的眼睛。他俯下身子，亲吻了她。

她的嘴唇动了动。“波培！”她又一次低语。犹如有人将一桶粪水径直倒在了他的脸上。

他突然怒火中烧。第二次受挫了，他悲痛的激情终于寻找到一个出口，转变为痛苦的怒气。

“可我是约翰！”他大喊，“我是约翰！”他是那么愤怒、那么痛苦，他抓住她的肩膀，猛力地摇晃她。

琳达的眼睛睁开了，她看到他了，认出他了——“约翰！”——但是，她却错把这张真实的脸，这双真实、粗暴的手，放入了一个想象的世界，跟广藿香和超高音构成的内在、私密的世界混同在一起，跟那些构成她梦境的变形的回忆和变化了的感觉混同在一起。她认出他是约翰，她的儿子，可是却错把他当成了她在玛尔帕斯的天堂的一个擅自闯入者，她和波培正在那里一起度唆麻假。因为她喜欢波培，他才生气了，因为她和波培一起在床上，他才摇晃她，好像这么做有什么不对似的，好像文明人不这么做似的。“人人彼此相属……”她的声音突然减弱了，变成了一种喘不上气的咳咳声，几乎听不见。她的嘴巴大张着，她在做最后的努力，试图将空气吸到肺中。可是，她看起来好像已经忘记了如何呼吸。她想喊，可是发不出声音，只有她那瞪视的眼睛显露出她在承受着痛苦。她的双手抓住了喉咙，然后，她又开始抓挠空气，可是，她已经不能呼吸，空气对她而言已经不复存在。

野蛮人站了起来，弯腰对着她。“怎么了，琳达？怎么了？”他的声音像在乞求，好像在央求她给他一丝安慰。

她看他的眼神里充满一种无言的恐惧，在他看来，还掺杂着指责。她试图从床上坐起来，可是却摔在枕头上。她的脸恐怖地扭曲着，嘴唇青紫。

野蛮人转身向病房另一侧跑去。

“快来人，快！”他大喊，“快！”

护士长正站在一圈玩找拉链游戏的多胞胎孩子中间。她最初的惊讶几乎马上转变为不满。“不要大喊！考虑考虑孩子们，”她皱着眉说，“你可能会破坏他们的训练……可是，你在干什么？”他冲进了圈子。“小心！”一个孩子大喊。

“快，快！”他抓住她的袖子，拽着她，“快！出事了，我把她害死了。”

等他们回到病房的另一侧，琳达已经死了。

野蛮人震惊地沉默了一会儿，然后跪倒在床边，用手捂住脸，不能自抑地开始哭泣。

护士站在那里，拿不定主意，一会儿看看床边跪着的人（耸人听闻的表现！），一会儿看看房间另一侧那些停止找拉链游戏、正往这边看的孩子（可怜的孩子们！），所有的眼睛和鼻孔都冲着这边，看着第二十床边上正在上演的令人震惊的场景。她该对他说些什么吗？如何才能重新让他表现得体面一些？提醒他现在在何处？他对那些可怜无辜的孩子可能会造成多么致命的伤害？这种令人恶心的叫喊会破坏他们健康的死亡条件训练的，好像死亡是多么可怕的事情似的，好像有谁真的那么重要似的！可能会让他们对死亡产生灾难性的想法，可能会扰乱他们，导致他们产生完全错误的、完全反社会的反应。

她上前一步，碰了碰他的肩膀。“你难道不能表现好点吗？”她压低声音，生气地说。她转过头去，发现已经有六七个孩子站起来，正往这边走。那个游戏圈子已在散开。再过一会儿……不，那样会冒太大的险。整个组的孩子都可能会在这个训练课程方面退步六到七个月。她匆匆走向受到威胁的孩子们。

“现在，谁想要巧克力手指饼？”她大声问，语气欢快。

“我！”整个波卡诺夫斯基组别的孩子一起喊道。第二十床的病人完全给抛到脑后去了。

“哦，上帝，上帝，上帝……”野蛮人不断地重复道。他混杂着悲伤和悔恨的毫无头绪的头脑，现在只能发出这一个词。“上帝！”他大声地自言自语，“上帝……”

“他到底在说什么？”一个声音问，非常近，非常清晰而刺耳，盖过了超级女高音婉转的歌唱。

野蛮人吓了一大跳，把手从脸上拿开，循声看过去。五个穿着卡其色的多胞胎，站成一排，每个孩子的右手都拿着一根吃了一半的手指饼，他们一模一样的脸上都蹭上了不同形状的巧克力汁。他们像哈巴狗一样，鼓着眼睛看着他。

与他的眼神对视后，他们同时傻笑起来。一个孩子用半截手指饼指了指。

“她死了吗？”他问。

野蛮人默默地看了他一会儿，又默默地站起来，默默地、缓缓地向门口走去。

“她死了吗？”那个好奇的孩子跟在他身边，一路小跑着，又追问了一次。

野蛮人低头看了看他，还是一声不吭，一把将他推开。孩子摔倒在地，马上大哭起来。野蛮人连看都没有看他一眼。





第十五章


在公园街临终医院里干体力活的工人是一百六十二个德尔塔，分为两个波卡诺夫斯基组别，分别是八十四个红头发的女性和七十八个黑头发、长脸的男性。晚上六点，他们一天的工作结束之后，两组人都聚集在医院的大厅里，由副财务主管的助理给他们分发当天的定量唆麻。

野蛮人从电梯里走出来，来到他们中间。但是，他的心思却在别处，他还在想着死亡、他的悲伤、他的悔恨。他机械地在人群中挤来挤去，根本没有意识到自己在做什么。

“你在推谁呢？你知道你在往哪里走吗？”

从那许许多多的喉咙里，却只发出了两种声音，一种是高亢、尖声尖气的，一种是低沉、粗声大气的。只有两张脸在不断地重复，犹如透过一长串的镜子看到的那样，一张是光滑的、长着点点雀斑的满月脸，被橘红色的头发环绕着，另一张是瘦削的、长着鹰钩鼻的脸，脸上还带着两天未刮的胡子茬，这些脸孔现在都在愤怒地对着他。他们的话语，还有他们狠狠地捅在他肋骨上的胳膊肘，终于令他从恍惚状态中惊醒过来。他再次回到了外部的现实世界，往四周看看，明白了他眼前的景象，他的心猛地一沉，伴随着一阵恐惧和恶心。他明白了，眼前的一切，就是自己日日夜夜不断反复出现的精神错乱，以及有涌来涌去的千篇一律的梦魇的根源所在。多胞胎，多胞胎……他们就像蛆虫一样，蠕动着，亵渎了琳达之死的奥秘。现在，他们还是像蛆虫一样，只不过个子更大一些，更成熟一些，爬过他的悲伤与悔恨。他止住了脚步，瞪着迷茫恐惧的眼睛，盯着周围卡其色的人群。他此刻站在那里，比周围的人高出一头。“这里有多少美好的人！”那唱歌般的声音在嘲弄他，讥讽他，“人类是多么美丽！哦，美丽的新世界……”

“分配唆麻了！”一个声音高声喊，“请排好队。那边的，赶快过来。”

一道门打开了，一张桌子和一把椅子给抬到了大厅里。说这话的是一个志得意满的年轻阿尔法，他抱着一个黑色的铁制钱箱子走了进来。那些充满期盼的多胞胎发出一阵满足的呢喃声。他们已经忘记了野蛮人，注意力全都集中在黑色的钱箱上。年轻人把箱子放在桌上，正在开锁。盖子打开了。

“啊哦！”一百六十二人同时发出喊声，好像他们在观看焰火表演。

年轻人掏出一把小小的药盒。“现在，”他趾高气扬地命令，“请走上前来。一次一个，不许推搡。”

那些多胞胎一个一个地走上前，不推也不搡。先是两个男人，然后是一个女人，又是一个男人，然后三个女人，然后……

野蛮人站在那里看着。“哦，美丽的新世界，哦，美丽的新世界……”在他的脑海里，这些唱歌般的声音似乎变了音调。它们在嘲笑他的悲惨与悔恨，带着多么玩世不恭的讥讽语调！它们狰狞地大笑着，强调着这梦魇中的低贱和肮脏及其令人恶心的丑陋。突然，它们像号角一般发出了拿起武器的命令。“哦，美丽的新世界！”米兰达是在宣告美丽的可能性，将眼前的梦魇转变为某种美好、高尚的东西的可能性。“哦，美丽的新世界！”这是一种挑战，一声命令。

“那边，不要推搡！”副财务主管助理生气地大喊。啪的一声，他将钱箱的盖子合上。“你们要是不规规矩矩的，我就不再发了。”

德尔塔们咕哝着什么，又推搡了一小会儿，之后就完全停住了。这个威胁奏效了。剥夺他们的唆麻，这想法太可怕了！

“这就好多了。”年轻人说，又打开了钱箱子。

琳达曾经是个奴隶，琳达已经死去了，其他人应该生活在自由之中，这个世界应该变得美丽。这是一种补偿，一种责任。突然，野蛮人知道他必须做些什么了，一切都变得那么清晰明了，如同一扇百叶窗已经打开，窗帘已经拉开。

“现在。”副财务主管助理说。

另一个穿卡其色的女人走上前去。

“住手！”野蛮人声音洪亮地大喊，“住手！”

他挤过人群，来到桌子前面，德尔塔们吃惊地盯着他。

“福帝啊！”副财务主管助理心里说，“是那个野蛮人。”他感到很害怕。

“听着，我求你们了，”野蛮人诚恳地说，“请听我说(1)　……”他从来没有在大庭广众下讲过话，因此，他发现很难表达清楚自己的想法，“不要吃那个可怕的东西，那是毒药，是毒药。”

“我说，野蛮人先生，”副财务主管助理说，讨好地笑着，“你不介意让我……”

“无论对你们的身体还是灵魂，都是毒药。”

“没错，可是请让我继续分发吧，好吗？这才是个好伙计呢。”他小心谨慎地轻轻拍拍野蛮人的胳膊，就像在抚摸一只凶险至极的动物，“就让我……”

“绝不！”野蛮人大喊。

“你看看，老伙计……”

“把它扔掉，把那种可怕的毒药全都扔掉。”

“扔掉”这个词穿透了德尔塔意识之外那些层层包裹的混沌与不解，直达其意识深处。人群中发出愤怒的哼哼声。

“我来带给你们自由，”野蛮人说，转身面对着那群多胞胎，“我来……”

副财务主管助理没有听下去，他悄悄地溜出大厅，在电话号码本上查询一个号码。




“不在他自己的房间，”伯纳德总结道，“不在我的房间，不在你的房间，不在爱神俱乐部，不在中心，也不在学院。他会去哪里了呢？”

赫尔姆霍茨耸了耸肩。他们下班回来，本来以为野蛮人会在他们惯常会面的地方等着他们，可是，现在却到处找不到他。这真令人恼火，因为他们打算乘坐赫尔姆霍茨的四座运动直升机去比亚里茨，如果他不马上来，他们吃晚餐就要迟到了。

“我们再等他五分钟，”赫尔姆霍茨说，“如果他还不来的话，我们就……”

电话铃的声音打断了他的话，他拿起话筒。“你好，请说。”他听了一段时间之后，“福帝在车里！”他咒骂了一句，“我马上来。”

“怎么了？”伯纳德问。

“在公园街医院工作的一个朋友。”赫尔姆霍茨说，“野蛮人在那里。好像发疯了。不管怎么样，事情很紧急。你和我一起去吗？”

他们匆匆地跑过走廊，跑向电梯。




“你们喜欢当奴隶吗？”他们走进医院时，野蛮人正在说。他的脸涨得通红，他的眼睛里闪着热情而愤慨的光芒。“你们喜欢当小婴儿吗？是的，小婴儿。哇哇叫着、还吐奶的小婴儿。”他补充道，对于他们动物般的愚蠢，他简直气急败坏，开始侮辱起他本来要拯救的那些人。他侮辱的话语撞到他们厚厚的愚蠢硬壳的表面，却又弹了回来，他们瞪视着他，表情空洞迟钝，眼神里含着愠怒和憎恨。“是的，吐奶！”他几乎在喊叫了。悲伤和悔恨、同情与责任，他把这些都忘掉了，或者说，这些情绪现在都被吸到了对这些非人的怪物强烈的、压倒一切的憎恨之中。“你们不想要自由，不想做真正的人吗？你们甚至都不明白什么是自由，什么是人吗？”愤怒让他说话更加流畅，那些词语很自如地喷涌而出，“是不是呢？”他重复道，可是他的问话没有得到任何回应，“那好吧，”他严肃地继续说，“我来教你们。我来带给你们自由，不管你们愿意不愿意。”他打开一扇面对医院内院的窗户，开始将装唆麻片的小盒子一把一把地抓出来，扔到窗外去。

有一阵子，卡其色的人群默默地看着这个恣意亵渎的场景，目瞪口呆，既震惊又恐惧。

“他疯了，”伯纳德轻轻地说，大睁着眼睛看着，“他们会杀了他，他们会……”人群中爆发出一声大叫，人群像波浪一样，气势汹汹地向野蛮人涌过去。“福帝救救他！”伯纳德说，将视线移开。

“福帝只救那些自救的人。”赫尔姆霍茨·华生笑着，几乎是骄傲地笑着，挤进人群。

“自由，自由！”野蛮人大喊，一只手继续往窗户外边扔唆麻，另一只手不断击打着那些攻击者不分彼此的脸，“自由！”突然，赫尔姆霍茨来到了他的身边——“赫尔姆霍茨，我的好老兄！”赫尔姆霍茨也开始四处乱打了——“终于成为真正的人了！”——与此同时，赫尔姆霍茨的手也开始一把一把地将毒药扔出窗外。“是的，人，真正的人！”毒药全部都扔掉了，他举起钱箱，给他们展示那黑乎乎、空洞洞的箱底，“你们自由啦！”

德尔塔们号叫着，带着双倍的怒火扑过去。

伯纳德站在战斗圈子的边缘，犹豫着。“他俩完了。”他说。他一阵冲动，跑向前，准备去救他们，可是想了想，改变了主意，又停下了。然后，他为自己的行为感到耻辱，再次向前，再次改变主意。他就这样站在那里，既感到耻辱，又难以抉择，想到如果自己不去施救，他们两个可能会被打死，可是如果去施救，自己也可能被打死，就在这时（感谢福帝！），警察冲了进来，都戴着鼓眼睛、猪鼻子的防毒面具。

伯纳德跑过去迎接警察。他挥舞着双臂，这毕竟是行动，他正在实实在在在地做点事情。他大喊了几声“救命！”，声音越来越大，做出自己真的在帮忙的假象。“救命！救命！救命！”

警察把他推开，迅速开始了工作。三个肩膀上扛着喷枪的警察向空中喷射了一团团浓浓的气体唆麻，另外两个正围着手提式合成音乐箱忙碌着，还有四个警察拿着装满强力麻醉剂的水枪，挤进了人群，有条不紊地、一股接一股地喷射着那些比较凶猛的打斗者。

“快，快点！”伯纳德喊叫着，“你们再不快点，他俩就被杀死了。他俩……哦！”一个警察被他的叽叽喳喳激怒，拿着水枪对他射了一枪。伯纳德摇晃着站了一两秒，两条腿似乎都失去了骨头、筋腱和肌肉，变成了两根果冻棍，后来连果冻都不如了，简直是水。他一团瘫软地倒在地上。

突然，从合成音乐箱里传出了说话的声音。这是理性之声，是良性情感之声。录音带在播放“二号合成反暴动演讲”（中等强度）。直接发自某个不存在的肺腑。“我的朋友们，我的朋友们！”这声音说得那么可怜，声音里透着无限温柔的指责的腔调，连戴着防毒面具的警察们都一度被泪水模糊了双眼，“这么做的意义是什么呢？你们为什么不开开心心地、规规矩矩地在一起呢？开心而且规矩，”这声音重复着，“和睦相处，和睦相处。”声音颤抖着，越来越低，短暂地陷入了静寂。“哦！我是那么想让你们开心，”声音又开始了，带着诚恳的期盼，“我是那么想让你们规矩！请你们，请你们规矩点吧……”

两分钟后，这声音和气体唆麻共同起了作用。德尔塔们眼含热泪，亲吻着，拥抱着彼此，六七个人同时错综复杂地拥抱在一起。就连赫尔姆霍茨和野蛮人都几乎要哭了。又重新从财务室搬来一箱唆麻片，又匆匆忙忙地开始了重新发放。多胞胎们听着那声音发出的深情的男中音告别辞，慢慢地散开了，哭哭啼啼的，好像他们的心都要碎了。“再见，我亲爱的，亲爱的朋友们，愿福帝祝福你！再见，我亲爱的，亲爱的朋友们，愿福帝祝福你。再见，我亲爱的，亲爱的……”

最后一个德尔塔也离开了，警察关闭了电源，那天使般的声音顿时消失了。

“你们是乖乖地跟我来呢，”中士问，“还是一定要逼我们使用麻醉剂呢？”他威胁地指了指他的水枪。

“哦，我们会乖乖地跟你走。”野蛮人回答，不时地抹一下受伤的嘴唇、被抓破的脖子和被咬伤的左手。

赫尔姆霍茨还在用手绢堵着流血的鼻子，他也点头同意了。

伯纳德刚刚苏醒过来，双腿恢复了知觉，他想乘着这个时机，尽量不引人注目地挪向门口。

“喂，你，那边的那个。”中士叫住他。一个戴着猪鼻子面具的警察匆匆跑过房间，将手搭在了那个年轻人的肩膀上。

伯纳德一脸无辜，愤慨地转过头。逃跑？他根本就没有动过这个念头。“尽管你们到底需要我干什么，”他对中士说，“我根本想象不出来。”

“你是这两个囚犯的朋友，是吧？”

“这个……”伯纳德说，迟疑着。不，他确实无法否认这一点。“凭什么我不是他的朋友呢？”他反问。

“那就跟我们来吧。”中士说，带着他们走向门口，那里停着一辆警车。

第十六章


三个人被领进的那个房间是控制官的书房。

“福下一会儿就下来。”伽马男管家将他们留在房里，离开了。

赫尔姆霍茨放声大笑。

“更像是请我们来参加咖啡聚会，而不像是审判啊。”他重重地坐进了那张最舒服的充气扶手椅。“高兴点，伯纳德。”他看到了他朋友那张铁青色的阴沉的脸，又说道。可是，伯纳德就是高兴不起来，他没有理睬赫尔姆霍茨，甚至连看都没有看他一眼，径直走过去，坐在了房间里最不舒服的那张椅子上，这是他刻意的选择，心里暗暗希望这样能够稍微平息一些来自上级的怒火。

与此同时，野蛮人正在房间里不安地溜达，带着茫然的、浅浅的好奇心瞅一眼书架上的书籍，看一眼编了号的小隔架上的录音带和阅读机上的线轴。在窗边的写字台上，放着一本柔软的黑色代皮革装帧的厚书，上面烫着巨大的金色T字。他拿起来，打开看看。《我的一生及事业》，我主福特著。这本书由福帝知识宣传协会在底特律出版。他懒懒地翻开书页，这里读一句，那里读一段，得出结论：他对这部书不感兴趣。就在这时，门开了，驻西欧的世界控制官步履轻快地走入房间。

穆斯塔法·蒙德与他们三个人一一握手，不过，他的话是对着野蛮人说的。“那么，你不太喜欢文明，野蛮人先生。”他说。

野蛮人看着他，他本来准备或者撒谎，或者吹牛，或者怒气冲冲地一言不发，可是，看着控制官脸上那善解人意的表情，他感到了安慰，决定说实话，坦言相告。“不喜欢。”他摇摇头。

伯纳德吓得一愣，满脸恐慌。控制官会怎么想呢？被人当成那个说不喜欢文明的人的朋友，约翰不仅是堂而皇之地说，而且偏偏是对控制官说的，太可怕了。“可是，约翰……”他刚开口，穆斯塔法·蒙德的一个眼神立刻让他可怜兮兮地闭上了嘴巴。

“当然了，”野蛮人接着承认，“这里有一些非常好的东西，比如，那些空气中的音乐……”

“有时成千的叮叮咚咚的乐器在我耳边鸣响，有时……听见了那种歌声……(1)”

突然，野蛮人的脸庞快活地放着光。“你也读过吗？”他问，“我以为在这里，在英国，没有人知道那本书呢。”

“几乎没有人。我是为数不多的人之一。你知道，那是本禁书。不过，因为我制定法律，我也能以身试法，并且具有豁免权，马克斯先生，”他补充道，转身面对伯纳德，“恐怕你就做不到。”

伯纳德陷入了更加无望的痛苦。

“可是，为什么要禁止这本书呢？”野蛮人问。因为遇到了一个读过莎士比亚的人，他激动万分，暂时忘记了其他所有事情。

控制官耸了耸肩。“因为它太古老了，这是主要原因。我们这里不需要古旧的东西。”

“即使这些东西非常美，也不需要？”

“尤其当它们非常美时。美丽会吸引人，我们不想让人们受到古旧东西的吸引。我们要让他们喜欢新东西。”

“可是新东西是那么愚蠢、那么可怕。比如那些戏，里面除了飞来飞去的直升机，以及你能感觉到人们在亲吻之外，一无是处。”他做了个鬼脸，“山羊和猴子！(2)”只有用《奥赛罗》里的话，他才能充分表达他的鄙视与憎恶。

“总归是善良驯服的动物。”控制官喃喃自语地补充道。

“你为什么不让他们看《奥赛罗》呢？”

“我告诉过你了，那太老了。另外，他们也看不懂。”

是的，这是真的。他想起了赫尔姆霍茨一边听着《罗密欧与朱丽叶》一边哈哈大笑的情景。“那么，”他停顿了一会儿，说，“一些像《奥赛罗》这样的新剧，一些他们可以看得懂的。”

“那就是我们一直想写的东西。”赫尔姆霍茨打破了长时间的沉默，说话了。

“也是你们永远写不出的东西，”控制官说，“因为，如果它真像《奥赛罗》，那么没有人看得懂，不管它有多新。况且，如果它是新的，就不可能像《奥赛罗》。”

“为什么不可能呢？”

“是啊，为什么呢？”赫尔姆霍茨也问道。他也忘记了目前处境里那些不妙的现实。只有伯纳德还记得，因为焦虑和害怕，他的脸呈铁青色。可是，别人都不理睬他。“为什么不可能呢？”

“因为我们的世界与《奥赛罗》中的世界不同。没有钢铁，你就造不出汽车；没有社会动荡，你也就写不出悲剧。当前的世界是稳定的，人们都很幸福，他们想要什么就有什么，他们永远不会想要得不到的东西。他们富裕，他们安全，他们不会生病，他们不害怕死亡，他们不懂激情和老年，这是多么幸福的事情！他们没有爸爸妈妈来添麻烦，他们没有妻子，没有孩子，没有情人，这样他们就不会产生什么激烈的感情。自小受到的条件训练让他们不得不按照规定的套路行事。如果出了什么问题的话，总还有唆麻。野蛮人先生，你却以自由的名义把唆麻都扔到窗外了。自由！”他哈哈大笑，“指望德尔塔们懂什么是自由啊！还指望他们懂什么《奥赛罗》！我的好孩子！”

野蛮人沉默了片刻。“可不管怎样，”他固执地说，“《奥赛罗》很好，比那些感官电影好得多。”

“当然是了，”控制官同意，“可是，这就是我们为维持稳定所必须付出的代价。你必须在幸福和人们过去说的高雅艺术这两者之间做出抉择。我们牺牲了高雅艺术。我们用感官电影和香味器取而代之。”

“可那些东西没有任何意义。”

“其意义就在于它们本身。对观众来讲，它们意味着许多美妙的感觉。”

“可是，它们……它们不过就是白痴讲的故事(3)。”

控制官不禁笑了。“对你的朋友，华生先生，你可不够客气啊。他是我们最杰出的情感工程师之一……”

“可他说得没错，”赫尔姆霍茨郁闷地说，“确实很愚蠢，没什么可写的，又不得不写……”

“正是如此。这就需要最巨大的聪明才智了。好比你在用最少量的钢铁制造汽车，除了纯粹的感觉外，你几乎不用什么东西，却在创造艺术品。”

野蛮人摇摇头。“在我看来，这一切都太恐怖了。”

“当然恐怖了。与苦难带给人们的过度补偿相比，实际的幸福总是显得廉价而肮脏。另外，稳定当然远不如动荡那么激动人心，心满意足也比不上与命运作殊死斗争那么光彩照人，当然，稳定也不及抗拒诱惑或者绝望地屈服于激情或疑虑那么引人入胜。幸福从来不是伟大的。”

“我想是这样的，”沉默了一会儿，野蛮人说，“可是，那些多胞胎简直糟糕透顶，果真必须如此吗？”他的手抹了一把眼睛，好像要把他记忆里不快的影子擦掉，装配台旁边排成长队的一模一样的侏儒们，在布莱特福德单轨车站入口处排队的两群人，琳达死亡时在她床边蠕动的人蛆，攻击他的无穷无尽的千篇一律的脸。他看了看自己已经包扎起来的左手，不寒而栗。“太可怕了！”

“可是多么有用啊！我看得出来，你不喜欢我们的波卡诺夫斯基组别，不过，我向你保证，他们就是一切得以建立的根基。他们就是将国家这架火箭飞机不偏不倚地稳定在航线上的陀螺仪啊。”他洪亮的声音令人激动地震颤着，他的手做着手势，比划着整个宇宙和机器不可阻挡的来临。穆斯塔法·蒙德的演讲几乎可以达到合成声音的标准。

“我在纳闷，”野蛮人说，“你们为什么要这些多胞胎？你们想从那些瓶子里得到什么就得到什么，既然做，为什么不把每个人都做成阿尔法++呢？”

穆斯塔法·蒙德哈哈大笑。“因为我们不想让人把喉咙割断，”他回答，“我们相信幸福与稳定。一个全由阿尔法组成的社会一定会陷入动荡与苦难。想象一个全由阿尔法组成的工厂，也就是说，工厂的每个人都是独立的、毫无关联的个体，血统良好，他们受过的条件训练让他们几乎可以（在一定限度之内）自由地做出任何决定，承担任何责任。想象一下吧！”他又重复了一遍。

野蛮人试着去想象这种情形，可是毫无结果。

“这太荒唐了。一个换瓶时是阿尔法、也受过阿尔法训练的人，如果让他去做艾普西隆半白痴的工作，他会疯掉的——或者会发疯，或者会开始搞破坏。阿尔法们可以进行完全社会化，不过，前提是，你得让他们做阿尔法的工作。只有艾普西隆们才能做出艾普西隆的牺牲，原因就在于，对他们来讲，那根本不算是牺牲，而是阻力最小的行动路线。他受的条件训练已经为他铺好了轨道，他必须沿着这条轨道向前跑。他不得不这么做，这是事先注定的。即使换瓶以后，他也仍旧像是处在瓶子里，一个看不见的瓶子，被固定在那些幼稚的胚胎时期形成的习惯之中。当然，我们每个人都是这样的，”控制官沉思着，继续说，“一生都在瓶子里。不过，如果我们碰巧是阿尔法，我们的瓶子，相对来讲，会非常大。如果把我们拘束在一个狭小的空间中，我们会非常痛苦。你不能将高种姓的代香槟倒入低种姓的瓶子。这在理论上是不言自明的，可是，还必须经过实践的检验。塞浦路斯实验的结果非常令人信服。”

“那是什么实验？”野蛮人问。

穆斯塔法·蒙德微微一笑。“你可以把它叫作重新装瓶实验。这个实验开始于福特纪元473年。控制官们让人将塞浦路斯岛上的居民全部清出去，重新迁入了特别准备的两万两千个阿尔法，发给他们全套的农业与工业设备，然后他们就自己管理自己的事务了。实验的结果跟所有的理论预计完全吻合。土地耕作不当，所有的工厂都在闹罢工，法律被视为儿戏，命令被违抗。所有被分派做一段时间低级工作的人都在不断地算计着如何获得高级工作，所有做高级工作的人则在反算计，如何不计代价地保住现有工作。不到六年的时间，他们之间就爆发了全面内战。当初那两万两千人中，有一万九千人都死掉了，那些幸存者一致向控制官们请愿，要求政府重新接管岛屿，于是政府重新介入。世界上唯一一个由阿尔法构成的社会就这样寿终正寝了。”

野蛮人深深地叹了口气。

“最佳人口结构，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“基于冰山理论，九分之八在水面以下，九分之一露在水面之上。”

“在水面以下的人幸福吗？”

“比水面以上的人还要幸福。比如，比你的这个朋友还幸福。”他指了指赫尔姆霍茨。

“尽管他们在做着那么可怕的工作？”

“可怕？他们并不这么觉得。正相反，他们喜欢这样的工作，这工作很轻松，简单得近乎幼稚，对他们的头脑和肌肉都不是负担。每天七个半小时强度低、不累人的劳作，之后就是定量唆麻、游戏、不受限制的性交和感官电影。他们还有什么可求的？确实，”他补充道，“他们可能会要求更短的工时。当然，我们可以缩短他们的工时。从技术上说，将低种姓的工作时间缩减到每天三到四个小时，那是极其简单的事情。可是，他们会因此更加幸福吗？不，他们不会的。曾经做过这个实验，那是在一个半世纪之前。整个爱尔兰都实行一天四个小时的工作制。结果如何呢？是动荡不安和唆麻消耗量的大幅增加，仅此而已。每天多出来的那三个半小时的休闲时间远非幸福的来源，结果人们反而不得不去度假逃离开这种空闲。发明办公室里堆满了各种节省劳力的计划，成千上万个，”穆斯塔法·蒙德做个了大手笔的手势，“我们为什么不去实施这些计划呢？是为了那些劳动者，如果再强加给他们过度的休闲时间，那纯粹就是残忍。农业也是一样的。如果需要的话，我们可以合成每一口食物，但是，我们不那么做。我们宁愿让三分之一的人口继续耕作田地，这是为他们好，因为从土地上种出粮食比在工厂里生产所花的时间要长一些。另外，我们必须考虑稳定的问题。我们不想要变化。每一种变化都是对稳定的威胁。这也是我们对待新发明的应用是如此谨慎的另一个原因。纯科学上的每一项新发现都具有潜在的颠覆性，我们有时候甚至必须要把科学当成可能的敌人。是的，就连科学也是潜在的敌人。”

科学？野蛮人皱了皱眉。他知道这个词，可是，这个词到底是什么意思，他说不上来。莎士比亚和村庄里的老年人从来都没有提到过科学，从琳达那里，他也只是听过最模糊的暗示：科学就是你用来制造直升机的东西，让你对着玉米舞大笑的东西，防止你长皱纹或掉牙齿的东西。他尽力想弄明白控制官的意思。

“是的，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“那是稳定的另一个代价。不仅仅只有艺术与幸福是互不相容的，科学与幸福也是格格不入的。科学是危险的，我们必须小心地给科学戴上锁链，套上笼头。”

“什么？”赫尔姆霍茨吃惊地说，“可是，我们一直在说，科学就等于一切呀。都是睡眠教育里的那些陈词滥调。”

“十三点到十七点，每周三次。”伯纳德插嘴说。

“还有，我们在学院里听到那么多关于科学的宣传……”

“是的，不过，是什么样的科学呢？”穆斯塔法·蒙德挖苦地说，“你们没有受过科学训练，因此，你们不能进行判断。我曾经是个很好的物理学家，绝对好的物理学家，好得可以意识到，我们所有的科学只不过是一本烹饪书，有一种传统的、不允许任何人加以质疑的烹饪理论，还有一套得不到主厨的特别允许就不得有任何添加的菜谱。我现在是主厨。但我曾经是个好奇的年轻洗碗工。我自己开始悄悄地做点烹调，不太正统的烹调，不合法的烹调，实际上，那是真正的科学。”他陷入沉默。

“后来发生了什么？”赫尔姆霍茨·华生问。

控制官叹了口气。“跟你们这些年轻人将要面临的事差不多，我差点要被遣送到一个岛屿上。”

这句话就像把伯纳德电击了一下，他马上不由自主地做出了猛烈而不合乎礼仪的举动。“把我遣送到一个岛上？”他跳了起来，跑过房间，站在控制官面前，指手画脚，“您不能把我送到那里去。我什么都没有做，是别人做的，我发誓，是别人做的。”他谴责般地指着赫尔姆霍茨和野蛮人，“哦，请不要把我送到冰岛。我发誓，我以后会做应该做的事情。再给我一个机会吧。请再给我一次机会。”他的眼泪流了出来，“我告诉您，是他们的错，”他哭泣着说，“不要让我去冰岛，哦，求您了，福下，求您了……”一阵悲惨的情绪袭来，他突然跪倒在控制官面前。穆斯塔法·蒙德试着让他站起来，可是，伯纳德固执地赖在地上，嘴里持续不断地嘟囔着。最后，控制官不得不按铃，叫四等秘书过来。

“带三个人过来，”他命令，“把马克斯先生带到一间卧室去。给他一剂唆麻气雾剂，然后把他放到床上，留他一个人在那儿。”

四等秘书离开了，又带着三个穿绿色制服的仆从回来了，把还在喊叫着、哭泣着的伯纳德给抬了出去。

“还以为有人要割他的喉咙呢，”门儿关上后，控制官说，“不过，如果他还有一丁点理智的话，他应该明白，对他的惩罚其实是一种奖励。他将被遣送到一个岛屿上，也就是说，将他送到一个能够遇到世界上最有趣的男男女女的地方。所有那些人，出于这个或那个原因，都变得过分个体化，不再能够融入集体生活，所有那些人，都是不满足于正统、产生了自己独立想法的人。每个人都是，或者说，每个人都还算个人物。我几乎要羡慕你了，华生先生。”

赫尔姆霍茨笑了。“那么，为什么你自己不去一个岛屿上呢？”

“因为，最终考虑之后，我选择了这里，”控制官回答，“当时给了我选择，或者去岛屿，在那里我可以继续我的纯科学研究，或者在控制官委员会就职，这样有朝一日会有希望继任，当上控制官。我选择了这个，放弃了科学。”沉默了一小会儿，他补充道，“有时候，我非常后悔放弃了科学。幸福是个难伺候的主人，尤其是他人的幸福。比真理更难伺候，幸亏人们受过条件训练，不加质疑地接受了现在的幸福。”他叹了口气，又陷入沉默，之后，他语调更加轻松地说，“唉，职责就是职责。我们没办法跟自己的喜好讨价还价。我对真理感兴趣，我喜欢科学，可是，真理是个威胁，科学会给公众带来危险，它既有益，又危险。它给了我们历史上最稳定、最平衡的社会。相较而言，中国就极度不稳定；就连最原始的君主制都不如我们现在的社会稳定。我再重复一遍，这都归功于科学。可是，我们不能放任科学破坏它自己取得的成就。为此，我们才小心谨慎地限制科学研究的领域——为此，我差一点被送到岛屿上去。我们只允许科学解决那些当前最急需的问题。所有其他方面的探索都要加以遏制。”停顿一会儿，他又接着说，“读一读福帝时代人们写的关于科学进步的文章，是很有意思的。他们似乎认为，不论出现什么情况，科学进步是可以无休无止地进行下去的。知识是最大的善，真理是最高价值，所有其他的都是第二位的、从属的。确实，即使在那时候，人们的观念就已经在发生变化。我们的福帝就做了大量的工作，试图将重心从真和美转移到舒适与幸福之上。大规模生产需要这种转变。是普遍的幸福推动着历史的轮子不停地转动，真和美却做不到。当然，任何时候，只要群众获得了政治权力，最重要的就是幸福，而非真和美。不过，尽管如此，在那个时候，还是允许无限制的科学研究。人们仍旧在谈论着真和美，好像那就是至高无上的善。直到发生了九年战争。战争使得人们完全换了一个腔调。如果炭疽炸弹在你的身边不断爆炸，真或者美，或者知识，又有什么意义呢？九年战争之后，首次开始对科学进行控制。人们甚至愿意对自己的胃口稍加控制，愿意做任何事，只要能换来安宁的生活。从此，我们就一直在控制科学发展。当然，这对寻求真理没有好处，但是，对获得幸福却大有益处。要获得就要付出，总是要为幸福付出代价的。华生先生，你现在就要付出代价了，因为你恰巧对美太感兴趣了。我当时对真理过分感兴趣，我也付出了代价。”

“可是你并没有去岛上啊。”野蛮人说，打破了长时间的沉默。

控制官微微一笑。“那就是我所付出的代价呀，通过选择为幸福服务，为其他人的幸福服务，而不是我个人的幸福。”他停顿了一会儿，补充道，“很幸运，世界上有那么多的岛屿。我都不知道，如果没有这些岛屿，我们该怎么办。我想，那就得把你们投入毒气室了。顺便问一下，华生先生，你喜欢热带气候吗？比如，马克萨斯群岛，或者萨摩亚群岛？或者更令人心旷神怡的地方？”

赫尔姆霍茨从充气椅上站了起来。“我喜欢极端恶劣的气候。”他回答，“我认为，在恶劣的气候下才能写出更优秀的作品。比如，如果经常有暴风骤雨……”

控制官点了点头，表示赞许。“我喜欢你的精神，华生先生，我真的非常喜欢。尽管以官方身份来讲，我非常不赞许这样的精神。”他微笑着说，“福克兰群岛怎么样？”

“好的，我觉得那里可以。”赫尔姆霍茨回答，“现在，如果你不介意的话，我想去看看可怜的伯纳德怎么样了。”

第十七章


“艺术，科学——你们似乎为自己的幸福付出了高昂的代价，”当房间里只剩下他和控制官时，野蛮人说，“还有别的代价吗？”

“哦，当然了，还有宗教，”控制官说，“过去有一种叫作上帝的东西，是在九年战争之前吧。可是，我有点忘记了。我想，你对上帝应该了如指掌吧。”

“嗯……”野蛮人犹豫着。他倒是愿意谈论一下孤独、夜晚、淡淡月色下的平顶高山、悬崖、向黑暗的阴影中的纵身一跃，以及死亡。他愿意谈论这些，可是他找不到词语来表达这些，即使莎士比亚作品里也没有。

与此同时，控制官走到了房间的另一头，打开一个大保险柜，这个保险柜是嵌进书架之间的墙上的。沉重的柜门打开了，他在柜子里面的黑暗中搜寻着。“这是一个，”他说，“我一直非常感兴趣的物件。”他抽出了一本厚厚的黑皮书，“比方说，你从来没有读过这个吧。”

野蛮人接过来。“《圣经：旧约与新约全书》。”他高声读了读扉页。

“也没有读过这本吧。”这是一本缺失了封面的小书。

“《效仿基督》。”

“还有这本。”他又递过来一本书。

“《宗教体验之种种》，威廉·詹姆斯著。”

“我还有许多呢，”穆斯塔法·蒙德又坐下了，继续说，“许多色情的老书。上帝在保险柜里，福帝在书架上。”他笑着指了指他自称的图书馆，指了指那些书架，还有那个装满阅读机线轴和录音带的架子。

“如果你了解上帝，你为什么不给他们讲讲呢？”野蛮人愤愤地问，“你为什么不让他们读读这些有关上帝的书呢？”

“和不给他们读《奥赛罗》的理由一样啊：它们太老了，是关于几百年前的上帝的书，不是关于现在的上帝的书。”

“可是上帝是不变的。”

“但是，人在变化。”

“那又有什么区别呢？”

“区别太大了。”穆斯塔法·蒙德说。他又站了起来，走向保险柜。“曾经有一个人，被称作纽曼主教(1)，”他说，“红衣主教，”他解释道，“在某种程度上可以说是唱堂的首席歌唱家。”

“‘我，美丽米兰的潘杜夫，红衣主教’(2)，我在莎士比亚作品里读过。”

“你当然读过了。正像我刚才说的，有一个叫作纽曼主教的人，喏，这就是那本书。”他抽出了书，“既然我在往外拿书，那就也把这本拿出来吧。这本是一个叫作曼恩·德·比朗(3)的人写的。他是个哲学家，你明白这是什么意思吧。”

“就是梦想的事物比天地间的事物要少的那种人(4)。”野蛮人立刻说道。

“非常对。我会给你读一个他当时梦想的东西。同时呢，你先听听那个古老的首席歌唱家怎么说吧。”他翻到书中夹有一个小纸条的地方，开始朗读起来，“我们并不属于我们自己，正如我们的所有物也并非属于我们自己。我们并没有创造我们自己，也不能凌驾于我们自己之上。我们并非自己的主人。我们是上帝的财产。这样看待这个问题，难道不是我们的幸福吗？认为我们属于我们自己，有任何幸福或者安慰可言吗？年轻富有的人也许可以这样想。他们可能认为，一切如其所愿，不必依靠任何人，不必考虑视线之外的事物，在做事时不必总是要承认、祈祷或征求他人的意志，这是很伟大的事情。可是随着时间的推移，他们会和其他人一样，发现人类并不是生而独立的，独立并不是自然的状态，也许会有短暂的独立，但那并不能将我们安全地带至终点……”穆斯塔法·蒙德停住了，将第一本书放下，拿起第二本，翻开书页。“以这个为例。”他说，深沉的嗓音又一次开始了朗读，“‘人会变老，随着老年之将至，他会产生虚弱、无力、不舒服等明显的感觉。有了这些感觉，他会觉得自己仅仅是生病了，将这个令人不安的状态归于某种具体的原因，如同疾病一样，他希望可以最终痊愈，以此减少自己的恐惧之情。自负的想象！这个疾病就是老年，它确实是可怕的疾病。人们说，随着人们渐渐老去，对于死亡和死亡后可能到来的事情的恐惧驱使他们转向宗教。不过，我的经验令我确信，除了这些恐惧或者想象之外，随着我们年龄的增长，宗教情绪逐渐增强，这是因为，随着我们的激情越来越平淡，随着我们的幻想和情感越来越难以激起，我们的理智受到的困扰越来越少，过去那些困扰我们、能够激起我们的意象和欲望、分散我们注意力的东西越来越少，因此，如同拨云见日般地，上帝出现了。我们的灵魂感受到了，看到了，转向了这所有光明的源泉，我们自然而然地、不可避免地转向了上帝。既然现在所有赋予这个世界感觉和魅力的东西都远离我们而去，既然实体的存在已经失去了内在或外在印象的支撑，我们感到了皈依某种永恒存在的事物的需要，某种永远不会欺骗我们的事物，某种现实，某种绝对而永存的真理。是的，我们不可避免地转向上帝。这种宗教情感在本质上是如此纯粹，对于感受到它的灵魂来讲，又是如此令人欣喜，它足以弥补我们所有其他的损失。’”穆斯塔法·蒙德合上书，向椅背上靠了靠。“在天地之间，那些哲学家没有梦想到的许多事情之一就是这个，”（他挥挥手）“我们，和这个现代世界。‘只有在拥有青春和财富时，你才是独立于上帝的；独立并不能把你安全地送到终点。’好了，现在我们拥有了可以一直送我们到终点的青春和财富。接下来会发生什么？很明显，我们可以独立于上帝了。‘宗教情绪可以弥补我们所有的损失。’可是，我们并没有什么可以弥补的损失，宗教情绪是多余的了。我们青年时期的欲望都可以得到满足，我们干吗四处寻找这些欲望的替代品呢？我们可以一直享受那些自古以来的胡闹行为，干吗还需要寻找那些消遣的替代品呢？我们的头脑和身体可以持续从活动中获得愉悦，我们干吗还需要休息呢？我们有唆麻，干吗还需要慰藉？我们已经拥有了社会秩序，干吗还需要某种永恒的东西？”

“那么，你认为没有上帝？”

“不，我认为很可能存在上帝。”

“那么，为什么……”

穆斯塔法·蒙德打断了他的话：“对于不同的人，上帝以不同的形式显现。在前现代时期，他以这些书里描述的形式显现。现在……”

“他现在如何显现呢？”野蛮人问道。

“嗯，他以缺席的形式显现，好像他根本就不存在一样。”

“这是你们的错。”

“把这叫作文明的错吧。上帝与机器、科学医药和普遍的幸福是格格不入的。你必须做出选择。我们的文明已经选择了机器、医药和幸福。这就是我为什么把那些书锁在保险柜里的原因。它们是肮脏的，人们读了之后会很震惊……”

野蛮人打断他的话：“感到上帝的存在，这不是很自然的吗？”

“你倒不如问问穿带拉链的裤子是否自然。”控制官讽刺地说，“你让我想起另一个叫作布莱德利的老家伙。他对哲学的定义是为人们本能相信的事物寻找糟糕的理由。好像人们真会本能地相信什么东西似的！人们相信什么，是因为他们受到了条件训练才相信的。为某种糟糕的理由寻找糟糕的理由，这就是哲学。人们相信上帝，是因为他们受到了相信上帝的训练。”

“可不管怎么样，”野蛮人坚持说，“当你独自一人，完全一个人，在夜晚思考死亡的时候，相信上帝是很自然的事情……”

“可是，人们现在再也不会独自一人了，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“我们令他们憎恨孤独，我们对他们的生活加以安排，让他们几乎不可能独处。”

野蛮人闷闷不乐地点点头。在玛尔帕斯的时候，因为他们将他从村庄的集体活动中隔离开来，所以他很痛苦；在文明的伦敦，他却因为难以从那些集体活动中逃离，难以完全独处，同样感到痛苦。

“你记得《李尔王》里的那几句吗？”野蛮人最终说道，“‘公正的天神使我们的风流罪过成为惩罚我们的工具；他在黑暗淫邪的地方生下了你，结果使他丧失了他的眼睛。’埃德蒙的回答，你还记得吧，他受伤了，快要死了。‘你说得不错；天道的车轮已经循环过来了，看看我现在的样子吧。’(5)现在，这几句怎么样？难道不像是有个上帝在掌管着一切吗，惩罚、奖励什么的？”

“是吗？”轮到穆斯塔法·蒙德发问了，“你可以与一个不孕女沉溺于任何风流的罪过，而不会被你儿子的情妇抠掉眼睛。‘天道的车轮已经循环过来了，看看我现在的样子吧。’可是，如果是现在，埃德蒙会在哪里呢？坐着充气椅，搂着一个女孩的腰，嚼着性荷尔蒙口香糖，看着感官电影。天神是公正的，这是毫无疑问的。可是，最终，他们的法令是由社会的组织者来颁布的。上帝听命于人。”

“你肯定吗？”野蛮人问，“你非常肯定，那个坐着充气椅的埃德蒙和那个受伤流血至死的埃德蒙没有受到同样严厉的惩罚吗？天神是公正的。难道天神没有用这些风流的罪过作为工具，降低他的人格吗？”

“从什么高度降低他的人格呢？作为一个快乐、勤恳、消费商品的公民，他是完美的。当然，如果你选择不同于我们的标准，你可能会说，他的人格降低了。可是，你必须遵从同一套规则，不能用玩狗狗离心碰碰球的规则去玩电磁高尔夫。”

“可是，价值不能凭着私心的爱憎而决定，”野蛮人说，“一方面这东西的本身必须确有可贵的地方，另一方面它必须为估计者所重视，这样它的价值才能确立。”(6)

“得了，得了，”穆斯塔法·蒙德抗议道，“这个有点离题太远了吧？”

“如果你允许自己考虑一下上帝，你就不会因为那些风流的罪过而自贬人格。你就有了耐心地忍受一些事情的理由，有了勇敢地去做一些事情的理由。我在印第安人中看到了这些。”

“我肯定你看到过这些，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“可是，我们不是印第安人。文明人没有必要忍受任何极度不适之处。至于说要做点事情，福帝不容他产生这样的念头。如果人们开始独立地做事情，那会扰乱社会秩序。”

“那么，自我克制呢？如果有上帝，就有了自我克制的理由。”

“可是，只有当不需要自我克制的时候，工业文明才成为可能。自我放纵到卫生和经济所容忍的最大限度，否则，轮子就会停止转动。”

“你们总是有理由需要贞操的吧！”野蛮人说，说话的时候脸微微发红。

“可是，贞操意味着激情，贞操意味着神经衰弱，而激情和神经衰弱意味着不稳定，不稳定意味着文明的消亡。没有那些风流的罪过，就不会有持久的文明。”

“可是，上帝就是一切高贵、美丽而英勇之事物存在的理由啊。如果你们有上帝……”

“我亲爱的年轻朋友，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“文明根本不需要高贵和英雄主义。那些都是低效率政治制度的症状。在像我们这种组织适当的社会里，没有人有机会变得高贵或者英勇。只有当形势变得极其动荡，那种机会才可能出现。哪里有战争，哪里有派系分化，哪里有必须要抵制的诱惑，哪里有心爱之物需要争取或者保卫——很明显，高贵和英雄主义才是有道理的。可是，现在已经没有了战争。人们万分小心地避免让自己过分地爱上某一个人。也没有了派系争斗，人们都受到了条件训练，不得不做你必须做的事情。而且，总的来说，你必须做的事情又是那么令人愉悦，那么多的自然本能得以充分释放，根本没有什么需要抵制的诱惑而言。另外，如果非常不幸，有什么不愉快的事情发生了，总是有唆麻，可以让你远离现实去度假。总是有唆麻平息你的怒火，让你与敌人重归于好，令你变得有耐心、能吃苦。在过去，你只能通过巨大的努力，花费多年进行道德修行，才能做到这些。现在，你只要吞服三两片半克的唆麻，一切就都好了。现在，任何人都可以道德高尚。你可以将你至少一半的道德装在一个瓶子里。不需流泪的基督教，这就是唆麻。”

“可是，眼泪是必需的。你不记得奥赛罗是怎么说的了吗？‘要是每一次暴风雨之后，都有这样和煦的阳光，那么尽管让狂风肆意地吹，把死亡都吹醒了吧！’(7)一位印第安老人给我们讲过一个故事，是关于那个玛塔斯基的少女的。那些想娶她的年轻人必须在她家的花园里锄一上午地。听起来并不难，但是，那里有苍蝇和蚊子，有魔力的那种。大多数年轻人根本忍受不了叮咬，但是，那个能够忍受这些的人，他得到了女孩。”

“真是动人的故事！不过，在文明的国度里，”控制官说，“你不必为女孩们锄地就能得到她们，也没有苍蝇和蚊子叮咬你。几个世纪之前，我们就消灭了它们。”

野蛮人点点头，眉头紧皱。“你们消灭了它们，是的，你们典型的做法。消灭任何令人不快的事物，而不是学着忍受它们。‘是否应默默地忍受坎坷命运之弓箭的无情打击，还是应与深如大海之无涯苦难奋然为敌，并将其克服。’(8)可是，你们哪一个都不做。既没有忍受苦难，也没有克服苦难。你们仅仅是消灭了那些弓啊箭啊的。那太容易了。”

他突然陷入沉默，想起了他的母亲。在那位于三十七层的房间里，她曾经漂浮在由会歌唱的灯光和带香味的爱抚构成的大海之上，逐渐漂远，漂出了空间，漂出了时间，漂出了她的记忆、她的习惯、她年老浮肿的身体的樊笼。想起了托马金，孵化与条件训练中心的前主任，他仍然在度假，在另一个世界里，远离了羞辱与痛苦，听不到那些可怕的词语，听不到那些揶揄的笑声，看不到那张丑陋的面孔，感觉不到那两条湿乎乎、软绵绵的手臂缠绕着自己的脖颈，在一个美丽的世界里……

“你们所需要的，”野蛮人继续说，“是带点泪水的东西，改变一下。你们这里的东西都不够昂贵。”

（“一千两百五十万美元，”当野蛮人告诉亨利·福斯特这一点的时候，亨利曾经抗议道，“一千两百五十万美元，这就是新的训练中心的造价。一分不少。”）

“……仗着勃勃之勇气与天命之雄心，罔顾不测之凶险，拼着血肉之躯奋然和命运、死神与危机挑战。这全为了小小一块弹丸之地！(9)这些句子不也有道理吗？”他抬头看着穆斯塔法·蒙德，问道，“除了上帝之外，当然上帝也是一个理由，危险的生活不是也有一定的道理吗？”

“太有道理了，”控制官回答，“男人和女人必须时不时地刺激一下他们的肾上腺素。”

“什么？”野蛮人不解地问。

“这是身体完全健康的一个条件。这就是我们强制实行V.P.S.治疗的原因。”

“V.P.S.？”

“强烈情感替代疗法。固定每月一次。我们让肾上腺素充溢人的整个系统。在生理上，这与恐惧和愤怒情绪是完全相等的。具有谋杀苔丝狄蒙娜和被奥赛罗谋杀的全部提神的效果，却没有丝毫的不便之处。”

“可是，我喜欢这些不便之处。”

“我们不喜欢，”控制官说，“我们更喜欢舒舒服服地做事情。”

“可我不需要舒服。我需要上帝，我需要诗歌，我需要真正的危险，我需要自由，我需要善，我需要罪孽。”

“实际上，”穆斯塔法·蒙德说，“你在要求不幸福的权利。”

“好吧，”野蛮人挑战似的说，“我在要求不幸福的权利。”

“更不用提变老、变丑和性无能的权利，染上梅毒和癌症的权利，吃不饱的权利，生虱子的权利，时时担心明天会发生什么的权利，患上伤寒的权利，被各种说不出的疼痛折磨的权利。”

一阵长久的沉默。

“我要求这一切。”野蛮人最终说。

穆斯塔法·蒙德耸了耸肩。“如你所愿。”他说。

第十八章


门虚掩着，他们进去了。

“约翰！”

从卫生间里传来了那种典型的令人不快的声音。

“出什么事了吗？”赫尔姆霍茨问。

没有人回答。那种令人不舒服的声音又传来了，一次，两次，然后是一片静寂。过了一会儿，卫生间的门咔嗒一声打开了，野蛮人走了出来，脸色苍白。

“我说，”赫尔姆霍茨关切地喊道，“约翰，你看起来真像生病了！”

“你吃了什么不合你胃口的东西了吗？”伯纳德问。

野蛮人点点头说：“我吃了文明。”

“什么？”

“我中毒了，我被玷污了。”他接着放低了声音补充道，“我吃了我自己的邪恶。”

“好吧，到底是什么呢？我是说，你刚才在……”

“现在，我净化了自己，”野蛮人说，“我喝了些温水冲服的芥末。”

那两个人吃惊地盯着他。“你是说，你刚才是故意那么做的？”伯纳德问。

“印第安人总是这么净化自己的。”他坐下来，叹口气，用手抹了抹额头，“我要休息几分钟，”他说，“我很累。”

“我一点也不吃惊。”赫尔姆霍茨说，沉默了一会儿，他又说，“我们是来跟你告别的，”他换了种语气，“我们明天早晨就离开。”

“是的，我们明天走。”伯纳德说，野蛮人注意到他的脸上新添了一种坚忍的、听天由命的表情。“顺便说一句，约翰，”他继续说，坐在椅子上的身体前倾，将一只手放在野蛮人的膝盖上，“我想说，我为昨天发生的事情抱歉，”他的脸红了，“多么耻辱，”他继续说，虽然声音有些颤抖，“真的，多么……”

野蛮人打断他的话，抓住他的手，亲切地捏了捏。

“赫尔姆霍茨对我太好了，”伯纳德停顿了片刻，接着说，“要没有他的话，我可能……”

“别说了，别说了。”赫尔姆霍茨抗议了。

他们陷入了沉默。虽然有些伤心，甚至正是由于这种伤心的情感，因为他们的伤心正是他们彼此爱对方的表现，这三个年轻人感到非常开心。

“今天早晨我去见了控制官。”最后，野蛮人说。

“去干什么呢？”

“去问问我能否和你们一起去岛上。”

“他怎么说？”赫尔姆霍茨急切地问。

野蛮人摇摇头。“他不允许。”

“为什么呢？”

“他说他想继续这个实验，可是，我才不会干呢，”野蛮人突然怒气冲冲地说，“我才不会让他继续拿我做实验呢。即使世界上所有控制官都请我来做，我也不做。我明天也要离开。”

“可是去哪里呢？”两个人一起问。

野蛮人耸了耸肩。“任何地方。我不在乎，只要我能够独自一人就行。”

*

下行线路从吉尔福德出发，沿着威谷径直下到戈德尔明，然后，越过米尔福德和威特利，通向黑斯尔米尔，再穿过彼得斯菲尔德，到达朴茨茅斯。和这条线路大概平行的上行线路，则经过沃普尔斯顿、堂海姆、普坦汉姆、埃尔斯坦德和格雷肖特。在野猪背和欣德黑德之间的一些地方，这两条线路之间的距离不超过六七英里。对那些漫不经心的驾驶员来讲，这段距离太小了，尤其是晚上他们多吃了半克唆麻之后。曾经出过一些事故，很严重的事故。后来决定将上行线往西挪移几英里。在格雷肖特和堂海姆之间，有四座废弃的航空灯塔，标志着从朴茨茅斯到伦敦的那条旧路线。这些灯塔的上空寂静无声，一片荒凉。现在，那些直升机是在塞尔伯恩、博尔敦和法纳姆的上空飞行，不间断地嗡嗡着，呼啸着。

野蛮人选择了一座旧灯塔作为自己的隐居地，这个灯塔位于普坦汉姆和埃尔斯坦德之间的一座小山上。这是个铁架水泥建筑，状况良好。当野蛮人首次勘查这个地方的时候，觉得这个住处简直过于舒服、过于文明化、过于奢侈了。他保证将以更加严酷的自律和更加彻底的净化加以弥补，以此安慰自己的良心。在隐居地度过的第一个晚上，他刻意没有睡觉。他整夜都跪在地上祈祷，一会儿向身负罪孽的克劳狄斯(1)曾经乞求过宽恕的上天祈祷，一会儿又用祖尼语向阿沃纳威娄纳祈祷，一会儿向耶稣和菩公祈祷，一会儿又向自己的守护兽雄鹰祈祷。他不时将胳膊展开，好像在十字架上那样。他一直保持这个姿势，随着时间一分一秒地流逝，他胳膊上的疼痛逐渐加剧，直到变成一阵阵刺骨的痛楚；他就这样挺着，承受着自发的钉刑，咬着牙，嘴里不断地重复着（同时，汗水顺着脸颊淌下来）：“哦，宽恕我吧！哦，让我变得纯洁！哦，助我变得善良！”一遍又一遍，直到他几乎因为疼痛而晕死过去。

天亮了，他感到已经赢得了住在这个灯塔里的权利，尽管大多数窗户上的玻璃还在，尽管从塔顶平台看过去的风景很美。最初他选择这个灯塔的原因现在几乎成了他想马上去别处的理由。起初，他决定在这里生活就是因为风景太美了，因为，从他的那个制高点，他正在面对着的似乎是神灵的化身。可是，他又有何德何能，得到如此的娇宠，能够每天、每小时都看到如此美景？他是谁，能够一直与上帝面对面？他只配生活在某个肮脏的猪圈里，某个阴暗的地下洞穴里。经过漫长一夜的折磨，他浑身依旧僵硬酸痛，但正是因此，他的良心才更加平静，他爬到了灯塔顶部的平台上，眺望着那个日出时分明亮的世界，感觉他已经重新赢得了在这个世界生存的权利。他北面的风景被野猪背长长的灰白色山脊包围，最东头的山脊后面，耸立着七座摩天大楼，那里就是吉尔福德。看到这些大楼，野蛮人苦笑了一下，但是，随着时间的推移，他将习惯这个景观。夜晚，这些摩天大楼或是装饰着亮闪闪的、几何形的星座，或是打着泛照灯，像通体透亮的手指（在英格兰，除了野蛮人，没有人能够明白这个手势的意义），庄严地指向天穹深不可测的奥秘之中。

一个山谷将野猪背和他的灯塔坐落的这座砂质小山隔离开来，在那里，普坦汉姆就像一个不起眼的小村庄，只有九层楼高，只有几个筒仓、一个家禽场和一个不大的维他命D工厂。在灯塔的另一侧，地势向南面渐渐下降，先是长长的长满石楠的缓坡，然后降低为一长串池塘。

在更远处，比树林更远的地方，矗立着一座十四层的塔楼，这就是埃尔斯坦德了。在英格兰薄雾笼罩的空气中，欣德黑德和塞尔伯恩看上去有点朦胧，吸引着你将视线往那蔚蓝的浪漫远处望去。不过，最初将野蛮人吸引到灯塔这里来的，并不仅仅是这种远景，近景也一样令人迷醉。树林，连绵不绝的石楠和黄色的金雀花，一丛丛的苏格兰桦树，杉树掩映下的闪闪发光的池塘，池塘里的睡莲和一簇簇的灯芯草，这些都是那么美丽，对于习惯了美洲干旱沙漠的眼睛来说，简直令人震惊。还有那孤独！几天过去了，他从来没有见过一个人影。这个灯塔离查令T字塔只有一刻钟的飞行距离，可是，就算是玛尔帕斯的山脉几乎也不比这位于萨里郡的荒野更加寂寥。一群群人每天离开伦敦，只是为了去玩电磁高尔夫或者网球。普坦汉姆那里没有高尔夫球场，最近的黎曼曲面网球场是在吉尔福德，野花和风景是这里唯一的吸引力。因此，没有来这里的充分理由，也就没有人来这里。在最初的几天里，野蛮人完全是一个人生活，毫无打扰。

他刚到文明世界的时候，领到了一笔款项，作为他日常花销之用。他把这笔钱大多花在了买装备上面。离开伦敦之前，他购买了四床人造丝-羊毛毯、粗粗细细的绳子、钉子、胶水、几件工具、火柴（虽然他计划着过一段时间就钻木取火）、几个锅壶、二十多包种子、十千克小麦面粉。“不，不要那种合成淀粉和废棉做的代面粉，”他坚持着，“即使它更有营养也不要。”可是，在面对泛腺体饼干和添加维生素的代牛肉时，他没有抵挡住店员的劝服。看着那些罐头瓶子，他猛烈地谴责自己的软弱。可憎的文明化的东西！他已经下定决心，坚决不吃那东西，即使快要饿死了也不吃。“给他们一个教训。”他报复似的想。对他自己也是一个教训。

他数了数钱，希望剩下的那点足够让他凑合着度过冬天。到来年春天，他的菜园里将生产出足够的食物，他就不用依赖外面的世界了。同时，总会有一些猎物的。他看到过许多野兔，池塘里还有水禽。他立刻动手制作一副弓箭。

灯塔附近有一些白蜡树，还有长满挺拔漂亮的榛子树苗的灌木林，可以做箭杆。他开始砍伐一棵嫩白蜡树，砍出一段六英尺长、没有枝杈的树干，剥掉树皮，开始切削，刮下白白的木屑，就像老米斯玛教他的那样，最后，剩下了一段与他的身高大致相等的木棍，中间稍粗且坚硬，两头纤细、灵活而柔软。这项工作给了他极大的乐趣。他在伦敦度过了好几星期懒散的日子，无所事事，需要什么东西的时候，只需按一下开关或者转一下手柄，现在，做一些需要技巧和耐力的事情，真是一大乐趣。

快要将木棍削出形状来的时候，他突然意识到自己在唱歌，他吃了一惊——唱歌！就好像，他碰巧刚刚从外面回来，看到自己正在干一件大坏事，抓了个正着。他惭愧了，脸唰地红了。毕竟，他来到这里，不是为了唱歌和享受，而是为了逃离文明生活的污秽对他进一步的腐蚀，是为了净化自己，让自己变得更好，是为了积极地赎罪。他沮丧地意识到，专注于切削他的弓的时候，他已经忘记了发誓要时刻牢记的事情——可怜的琳达，以及自己对她的凶狠和残忍，那些可憎的多胞胎，像虱子一样爬着，亵渎了琳达之死的奥秘，他们的存在不仅侮辱了他自己的悲伤和悔恨，更侮辱了天神们。他曾经发誓要牢记这些，他曾经发誓要不停地赎罪。可是，他却坐在这里，开心地坐在这里，忙着做弓，还唱歌，真的在唱歌……

他走进屋子，打开一盒芥末，倒了些水，放到火上开始煮。

半个小时之后，来自普坦汉姆的一个波卡诺夫斯基组别的三个德尔塔－农民开车去埃尔斯坦德，恰巧经过这里。到达山顶时，他们吃惊地发现一个年轻人站在废弃的灯塔外面，上身赤裸，正在用一根打了结的鞭子抽打自己。他的后背上面横亘着一道道深红色的印迹，从这些鞭痕上流下细细的血水。卡车司机将车停在路边，和两个同伴一起，目瞪口呆地盯着这不同寻常的景象。一下，两下，三下——他们数着鞭打的次数。打完第八下，年轻人停止了自我惩罚，跑到树林边上，开始猛烈地呕吐。吐完之后，他拾起鞭子，又开始鞭打自己。九下，十下，十一下，十二下……

“福帝啊！”司机低声说，他的两个同伴也深有同感。

“福帝！”他们说。

三天后，记者们来了，犹如落在尸体上的秃鹫。

弓体在绿色木头生起的文火上烤干变硬之后，就做好了。野蛮人正忙着做箭。已经削出三十支榛子木棍，晾干了，一头钉上了尖尖的铁钉，弦口也仔细刻好了。有一天晚上，他突袭了普坦汉姆的家禽场，现在他已经有足够的羽毛来装备整个武器库。他正在加工箭杆上的羽毛，这时，第一个记者找到了他。这个人穿着充气鞋子，悄无声息，从他的身后突然出现。

“早上好，野蛮人先生，”他说，“我是《每时广播》的记者。”

野蛮人吓了一跳，好像被蛇咬了一下，他跳了起来，箭杆、羽毛、胶水瓶子和刷子散落一地。

“请你原谅，”记者说，真心地感到愧疚，“我没有想……”他用手碰触了一下帽子，那是一顶铝制的烟囱形状的帽子，在帽子里面装有无线电接收器和发报器，“原谅我没法把它摘下来，”他说，“有点沉。如我刚才所说，我代表的是……”

“你想干什么？”野蛮人阴沉着脸说。记者报以他最讨好的笑容。

“哦，当然，我们的读者会非常感兴趣……”他的头歪向一边，脸上的笑容几乎像是在献媚。“野蛮人先生，就说几句话。”他做出了一系列快速的仪式般的动作，解开两团电线接上围在他腰间的便携式电池；将它们同时插入铝制帽子的两侧；碰了一下帽顶上的弹簧，一根天线射向了空中；碰了一下帽檐顶端的另一个弹簧，跳出一个麦克风，就像从玩偶盒子里跳出一个玩偶一样，麦克风悬在那里，在离他的鼻子六英寸处颤动着；拉下一对接收器，戴在耳朵上；按了一下帽子左边的开关，从里面传来微弱的黄蜂般的嗡嗡声；拧了一下右边的旋钮，嗡嗡声之上立刻又增添了听诊器里那种呼呼声和咳咳声、咯咯声和突然的吱吱声。“喂，”他对着麦克风说“喂，喂……”他的帽子里突然传出了一声铃响。“是你吗，厄泽尔？我是普利莫·梅尔伦。是的，我抓到他了。野蛮人先生现在要对着麦克风说几句话。你会说的吧，野蛮人先生？”他抬头看着野蛮人，脸上又挂上了他最迷人的笑容。“就告诉我们的读者你为什么会来这里。你为什么突然离开伦敦？（再等会儿，厄泽尔！）当然，还有那鞭子的事。”（野蛮人吃了一惊，他们怎么知道鞭子的事的？）“我们都非常想知道那鞭子是怎么回事。再说点对文明的看法。你知道的，就那类东西，‘我如何看待文明的姑娘’，等等。寥寥数语就行，寥寥……”

野蛮人照他的话做了，真的就只有令人不安的几个词。他只说了五个词语，只有五个，就是他对伯纳德说过的同样的话，他对坎特伯雷首席歌唱家的看法：“哈尼！桑斯埃索嚓那！”他抓住记者的肩膀，把他的身子扳过去（这个年轻人包裹得很严实，真是诱人），瞄准，然后像个职业足球运动员一样，猛力而准确地向他踢过去，狠狠的一脚。

八分钟之后，《每时广播》的最新一期就在伦敦的大街小巷售卖了。头版头条印着“《每时广播》记者被神秘野蛮人狠狠踢中尾骨”“轰动整个萨里郡”。

“甚至轰动了伦敦。”这个记者返回后，看到这些词句时心里想。况且，这种轰动还是那么痛苦。他小心翼翼地坐下，开始吃午饭。

又来了四个记者，他们丝毫没有被同事尾骨上那本可以用以警戒的踢伤吓倒，他们分别是《纽约时报》、法兰克福《四维闭连报》、《福帝科学箴言报》和《德尔塔镜报》的记者。他们当天下午来到灯塔，却遭到了越来越暴力的对待。

《福帝科学箴言报》的记者躲在远远的安全距离之外，仍旧在揉着屁股。“愚昧的傻瓜！”他大喊，“你干吗不吃点唆麻？”

“滚开！”野蛮人晃了晃拳头。

其他人退后几步，又转过身来。“如果你吃几片唆麻，邪恶就不复存在。”

“抠哈克哇咿呀透克呀咿！”语气凶恶且满含讥讽。

“痛苦只是幻象。”

“哦，是吗？”野蛮人说，捡起一根粗粗的榛子木棍，大步走了过来。

《福帝科学箴言报》的记者朝着自己的直升机飞奔过去。

这之后的一段时间内，野蛮人的生活回归平静。几架直升机飞来，围着灯塔好奇地盘旋。他向飞得最近、最缠人的一架射出一箭，射穿了驾驶舱的铝制地板，只听一声尖叫，飞机火箭般地加速升空，使出了它的超级充电器所能提供的最大速度。随后，其他飞机就敬而远之了。野蛮人毫不理会那些恼人的嗡嗡声（在他的想象中，他将自己比喻成玛塔斯基少女的众多求婚者之一，不为那些长翅膀的毒虫所扰乱，坚毅而执着），继续挖他那个未来的菜园。过了片刻，很明显，毒虫厌倦了，飞走了。连续几个小时，他头顶的天空中空空如也，除了云雀的鸣叫外，寂静无声。

天气又闷又热，叫人透不过气来，空中传来滚滚雷声。他挖了一上午的地，正躺在地板上休息。突然，对列宁娜的思念似乎变成了一个真实的存在，裸露着，几乎可以触摸到，她在说：“亲爱的！”“抱紧我！”她穿着鞋子和袜子，喷了香水。不要脸的娼妇！可是，哦，哦，她的胳膊在搂着他的脖子，她的乳房抬起来了，她的嘴！永恒就在我们的唇间和双眼。列宁娜……不，不，不，不！他跳了起来，半裸着身体，跑出房子。在荒原边上，有一大簇灰白色的杜松，他冲入杜松丛。他拥抱的，不是他渴望的光滑肉体，而是一捧绿色的松针。尖利的松针，上千个针尖，刺着他。他竭力去想可怜的琳达，她喘不过气，说不出话，两手乱挠着，眼睛里充满无言的恐惧。可怜的琳达，他曾经发誓要牢记的琳达。可是，缠绕着他的依然是列宁娜，他发誓要忘记的列宁娜。尽管杜松的松针在刺着他，扎着他，但他畏缩的肉体感受到的，还是列宁娜，真实的、难以逃避的列宁娜。“亲爱的，亲爱的……如果你也想要我，你干吗不……”

鞭子就挂在门边的钉子上，记者们来时可以随手就拿起来。野蛮人一阵迷乱，他跑回房子，抓住鞭子，挥舞起来。打了结的绳子咬进了他的肉体。

“娼妇！娼妇！”每打一鞭，他就大喊一声，好像他打的是列宁娜（他没有意识到，他多么疯狂地希望打的真是列宁娜啊！），白花花的、温暖的、喷喷香的、无耻的列宁娜，他正这样鞭打着她。“娼妇！”然后，他绝望地说，“哦，列宁娜，宽恕我吧。宽恕我吧，上帝，我道德败坏，我邪恶。我……不，不，你这个娼妇，你这个娼妇！”

在三百米开外的树林里，达尔文·波拿巴藏在他精心建造的隐身处，目睹了刚才的整个过程，他是感官电影公司最高明的大型野兽摄像师。耐心和技巧终于得到了回报。他在一棵人工橡树的树洞里坐了三个白天，又花了三个晚上在石楠丛中爬来爬去，将麦克风安装到金雀花丛中，将电线埋进柔软的灰色沙地。在七十二个小时里，他饱尝艰辛，现在，伟大的时刻到来了，最伟大的时刻——达尔文·波拿巴一边在他的仪器中间走动着，一边在想，自从他拍摄了那著名的有关大猩猩交配的全号叫、立体感官电影之后，这是最伟大的时刻。“太精彩了，”当看到野蛮人开始那令人震惊的表演，他自言自语，“太精彩了！”他将望远式照相机小心翼翼地瞄准并固定在那移动着的目标上，调大功率，以获得那张疯狂扭曲的脸的特写（太棒了！）；又调换成半分钟的慢镜头（将产生巧妙的滑稽效果，他向自己保证）；同时，他聆听着那些正在往位于胶卷边沿的录音带中录入的鞭打声、呻吟声、狂野而疯癫的话语声，试了试将声音稍微放大的效果（是的，绝对更好）；在短暂的停歇之中，他很高兴地听到了云雀高亢尖锐的歌声；他真希望野蛮人能够扭过身去，让他给他后背上的鲜血来个特写，这时，几乎是立刻（多么令人吃惊的好运气！），那个与人为善的家伙真的转过身去了，他拍了个完美的特写。

“嗯，好极了！”拍完之后，他心里想，“真是好极了！”他擦了把脸。等他们在制作室里加入感官效果，这会是一部绝佳的影片。达尔文·波拿巴想，几乎和《抹香鲸的爱情生活》一样优秀——福帝！那可就说明问题了！

十二天后，《萨里郡的野蛮人》正式上映，在西欧的每个顶级感官电影院都可以看到、听到和触摸到。

达尔文·波拿巴的电影立即产生了巨大的轰动。晚上推出的电影，第二天下午，一大群直升机就突然飞临约翰头顶，打断了他的乡间独处生活。

他正在菜园里挖地，在他的脑海里，他也在挖着，费力地翻动着头脑中的思绪。死亡——他的铁锹落下去，一下，一下，再一下。我们所有的昨天，不过替傻子们照亮了到死亡的土壤中去的路。(2)一阵有说服力的雷声在那些词语之上訇然作响。他又抡起了一锹土。为什么琳达会死？为什么要让她逐渐变得不像人样，最后……他打了个冷战。可亲可吻的好腐肉。(3)他将脚放在铁锹上，狠狠地踩入坚硬的土地。天神掌握着我们的命运，正像顽童捉到苍蝇一样，为了戏弄的缘故而把我们杀害。又一声响雷。这些话宣告着自己的正确，甚至比真理本身还正确。可是，葛罗斯特却把他们叫作永远温柔的天神。(4)还有，睡眠是你所渴慕的最好的休息，死是永恒的宁静，你却对它心惊胆战。(5)睡眠，可能会做梦。(6)他的锹碰到了一块石头，他弯腰捡起来。可是，在那死亡的睡眠里，会做什么样的梦呢？(7)……

头顶上的嗡嗡声变成了轰鸣声，一片阴影突然遮住了他，有什么东西挡在了他和太阳之间。他停下挖掘，停下思考，抬头望去，吓了一跳。他迷茫不解地抬头去看，脑子还在比真理还正确的另一个世界里游荡，注意力仍然还停留在死亡与神祇的重大问题上。他抬头看去，看见了，那群盘旋着的直升机，离他的头顶那么近。它们就像蝗虫一样飞过来，悬停在半空，然后降落在他四周的荒原上。从这些巨大的蝗虫肚子里，走出了穿白色人造丝-法兰绒衣服的男人，穿黏胶-茧绸套装或者天鹅绒短裤和拉链半开的无袖汗衫的女人（天气很热）——从每架飞机中都走出一对男女。不一会儿，就走出来几十个人，他们围着灯塔，形成一个大圈子，盯着他看，嬉笑着，咔嚓咔嚓地照着相，向他扔花生（就像扔给一只猴子），扔一包包性荷尔蒙口香糖，扔泛腺体小奶油饼。每时每刻，他们的数量都在增加，此时，在野猪背的上空，飞机还在不断地蜂拥而来。如同在噩梦中一般，几十个人变成了上百个，上百个又变成了几百个。

野蛮人退回到隐蔽处。现在，他背靠灯塔的墙壁，姿势如同困兽一样，一张张脸地看过去，恐惧得说不出话来，像个疯子。

突然，一包瞄准精确的口香糖砸到了他的脸颊，把他从恍惚状态中惊醒，他意识到了眼前的现实。他痛苦地惊叫一声，他完全清醒了，清醒而怒火中烧。

“滚开！”他大喊。

猴子说话了，周围爆发出一阵大笑和鼓掌声。“好野蛮人！好哇，好哇！”他在这些杂乱的声音里听到有人在喊：“鞭子，鞭子，鞭子！”

这话提醒了他，他从门后的钉子上抓起那段打了结的绳子，对着折磨他的人晃了晃。

一阵讥讽的喝彩声和掌声。

他气势汹汹地走向他们。一个女人害怕地叫起来。队伍中离危险最近的人们犹豫了一下，然后又站直了，坚定地站在那里。这些观光者意识到自己在力量上具有压倒性的优势，因此勇气大增，这大大出乎野蛮人的意料。他吃了一惊，停住了脚步，向四处望望。

“你们为什么不让我一个人待着？”他的愤怒里几乎带着一种哀怨。

“吃点镁盐杏仁吧！”如果野蛮人继续向前，将第一个受到攻击的那个男人说，他递过来一包，“很好吃，你知道的，”他又说，讨好的笑容有些紧张，“镁盐会帮助你永葆青春。”

野蛮人没有理会他递过来的东西。“你们找我干什么？”他看着一张张傻笑的脸，问道，“你们找我干什么？”

“鞭子，”上百个声音乱糟糟地说，“表演一下那鞭子功夫，给我们看看鞭子功。”

然后，伴着缓慢沉重的节奏，他们一起喊起来：“我们——想看——鞭子。”队伍后边的一群人喊：“我们——想看——鞭子。”

其他人马上也跟着喊了起来，不断地重复着这句话，鹦鹉学舌一般，一遍又一遍，声音越来越大，喊到第七次或第八次的时候，就没有其他声音了，只剩下“我们——想看——鞭子”。

他们都在一起喊着。这声音，这团结，还有作为补偿的节奏感，都令他们陶醉，他们似乎可以连续喊叫几个小时，几乎可以无休无止地喊下去。可是，喊到大概第二十五次的时候，这喊叫被突如其来地打断了。又一架直升机飞过野猪背，悬停在人群上方，然后，在观光者和灯塔之间的空地上，在距离野蛮人几码远的地方降落了。螺旋桨的咆哮声暂时淹没了喊声。飞机落地了，马达关掉了。“我们——想看——鞭子，我们——想看——鞭子”的喊声再次爆发，同样响亮、同样急切的单调声音。

直升机门打开了，走出一个金发碧眼、脸色红润的年轻人，随后走出来的，是一个穿着绿色天鹅绒短裤和白衬衫、戴着骑士帽的年轻姑娘。

野蛮人一看到这个姑娘，吓得直往后退，脸色变得煞白。

那个姑娘站在那里，对他微笑着——不自信的、乞求的、几乎是低声下气的微笑。时间一秒秒地过去了，她的嘴唇翕动，她在说着什么，可是，她的声音被观光者们一次次的大喊遮盖住了。“我们——想看——鞭子！我们——想看——鞭子！”

姑娘将两只手紧紧地贴在自己身体的左侧，她那桃红色的、布娃娃般的明媚脸蛋上出现了极不协调的渴望和悲伤。她碧蓝的眼睛似乎变大了，更加明亮了。突然，两颗泪珠顺着她的脸颊滚落。她又说了什么听不见的话，然后，她突然动情地张开双臂，向着野蛮人走过来。

“我们——想看——鞭子！我们——想看……”

突然之间，他们看到了他们想看的。

“娼妇！”野蛮人像个疯子一样冲向她，“臭猫！”他像个疯子，要用那打结的鞭子抽打她。

她吓坏了，扭头就逃，绊了一下，摔倒在石楠丛中。“亨利！亨利！”她大喊，可是，那个红脸膛的年轻人已经逃到直升机后面，躲到安全之处了。

人群又兴奋又激动，大喊着，散开来，一窝蜂地向那个有磁力般的焦点簇拥过来。痛苦真是一种令人痴迷的恐怖。

“惩罚，好色，惩罚！(8)”迷乱之中，野蛮人再次挥起鞭子抽打起来。

人们饥渴地聚集在周围，像食槽周围的猪，乱哄哄地推搡着，拥挤着。

“哦，肉体！”野蛮人咬牙切齿。这一次，他抽打的是自己的肩膀，“杀死它！杀死它！”

人们着迷于这种痛苦的恐怖景象，又被合作的习惯以及那种寻求一致和补偿的欲望驱动（早年的条件训练已将这种欲望植根于他们的头脑，难以消除），他们开始模仿野蛮人那癫狂的举动，击打着彼此的身躯，同时，野蛮人正在鞭打他自己叛逆的肉体，或者鞭打着他脚下的石楠丛中那团蠕动着的丰满肉体，那个淫乱的化身。

“杀死它，杀死它，杀死……”野蛮人还在大喊。

突然，有人开始高唱“狂欢啊狂欢”，不一会儿，人们都唱开了，不断地重复着那个叠句，开始跳舞。狂欢啊，一圈又一圈，打着六八拍，击打着彼此。狂欢啊……

午夜过后，最后一架直升机起飞离开了。野蛮人正在石楠丛中沉睡，唆麻令他呆滞，长时间疯狂的肉欲放纵令他精疲力竭。他醒来时，太阳已经高照。他躺了片刻，像猫头鹰一样，对着阳光眨着不解的眼睛，突然，他想起来了，一切都想起来了。

“哦，我的上帝，我的上帝呀！”他用手蒙住了眼睛。




那天晚上，一群群嗡嗡叫着的直升机飞过野猪背，形成了绵延十公里的乌云。所有的报纸上都登载了对昨天晚上赎罪般的狂欢的描述。

“野蛮人！”最早到达的人们走下飞机，喊道，“野蛮人先生！”

没有回答。

灯塔的门虚掩着。他们推开门，步入百叶窗背后的昏暗。透过房间另一头的拱门，他们可以看到通往楼上的楼梯的底部。在圆拱的下方，悬挂着一双脚。

“野蛮人先生！”

那双脚，就像圆规的两条不慌不忙的腿，缓慢地，缓慢地转向右边，北，东北，东，东南，南，西南，然后停住了，悬停了几秒钟，接着又慢条斯理地转向左边，西南，南，东南，东……

Chapter One


A squat grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main entrance the words, CENTRAL LONDON HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY.

The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.

“And this,” said the Director opening the door, “is the Fertilizing Room.”

Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D. H. C. for Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments.

“Just to give you a general idea,” he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently—though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.

“To-morrow,” he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, “you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for generalities. Meanwhile…”

Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the notebook. The boys scribbled like mad.

Tall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. He had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? Fifty? Fifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn't arise; in this year of stability, A. F. 632, it didn't occur to you to ask it.

“I shall begin at the beginning,” said the D.H.C., and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the beginning. “These,” he waved his hand, “are the incubators.” And opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test-tubes. “The week's supply of ova. Kept,” he explained, “at blood heat; whereas the male gametes,” and here he opened another door, “they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes.” Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs.

Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction—“the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' salary”; continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature, salinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa—at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again; how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky's Process.

“Bokanovsky's Process,” repeated the Director, and the students underlined the words in their little notebooks.

One egg, one embryo, one adult—normality. But a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. Progress.

“Essentially,” the D.H.C. concluded, “bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and, paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding.”

Responds by budding. The pencils were busy.

He pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box, another, rack-full was emerging. Machinery faintly purred. It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. Eight minutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop; then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four, eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded—bud out of bud out of bud were thereafter—further arrest being generally fatal—left to develop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos—a prodigious improvement, you will agree, on nature. Identical twins—but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by scores at a time.

“Scores,” the Director repeated and flung out his arms, as though he were distributing largesse. “Scores.”

But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay.

“My good boy!” The Director wheeled sharply round on him. “Can't you see? Can't you see?” He raised a hand; his expression was solemn. “Bokanovsky's Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!”

Major instruments of social stability.

Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg.

“Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!” The voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. “You really know where you are. For the first time in history.” He quoted the planetary motto. “Community, Identity, Stability.” Grand words. “If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved.”

Solved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Millions of identical twins. The principle of mass production at last applied to biology.

“But, alas,” the Director shook his head, “we can't bokanovskify indefinitely.”

Ninety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average. From the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of identical twins as possible—that was the best (sadly a second best) that they could do. And even that was difficult.

“For in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach maturity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here and now. Dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century—what would be the use of that?”

Obviously, no use at all. But Podsnap's Technique had immensely accelerated the process of ripening. They could make sure of at least a hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. Fertilize and bokanovskify—in other words, multiply by seventy-two—and you get an average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical twins, all within two years of the same age.

“And in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals.”

Beckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment. “Mr. Foster,” he called. The ruddy young man approached. “Can you tell us the record for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?”

“Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre,” Mr. Foster replied without hesitation. He spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. “Sixteen thousand and twelve; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. But of course they've done much better,” he rattled on, “in some of the tropical Centres. Singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and Mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! It's quite astonishing, when you're used to working with European material. Still,” he added, with a laugh (but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging), “still, we mean to beat them if we can. I'm working on a wonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment. Only just eighteen months old. Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, either decanted or in embryo. And still going strong. We'll beat them yet.”

“That's the spirit I like!” cried the Director, and clapped Mr. Foster on the shoulder. “Come along with us, and give these boys the benefit of your expert knowledge.”

Mr. Foster smiled modestly. “With pleasure.” They went.

In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. Flaps of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement. Whizz and then, click! the lift-hatches hew open; the Bottle-Liner had only to reach out a hand, take the flap, insert, smooth-down, and before the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the endless band, whizz, click! another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths, ready to be slipped into yet another bottle, the next of that slow interminable procession on the band.

Next to the Liners stood the Matriculators. The procession advanced; one by one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the larger containers; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit, the morula dropped into place, the saline solution poured in…and already the bottle had passed, and it was the turn of the labellers. Heredity, date of fertilization, membership of Bokanovsky Group—details were transferred from test-tube to bottle. No longer anonymous, but named, identified, the procession marched slowly on; on through an opening in the wall, slowly on into the Social Predestination Room.

“Eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index,” said Mr. Foster with relish, as they entered.

“Containing all the relevant information,” added the Director.

“Brought up to date every morning.”

“And co-ordinated every afternoon.”

“On the basis of which they make their calculations.”

“So many individuals, of such and such quality,” said Mr. Foster.

“Distributed in such and such quantities.”

“The optimum Decanting Rate at any given moment.”

“Unforeseen wastages promptly made good.”

“Promptly,” repeated Mr. Foster. “If you knew the amount of overtime I had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake!” He laughed good-humouredly and shook his head.

“The Predestinators send in their figures to the Fertilizers.”

“Who give them the embryos they ask for.”

“And the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail.”

“After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store.”

“Where we now proceed ourselves.”

And opening a door Mr. Foster led the way down a staircase into the basement.

The temperature was still tropical. They descended into a thickening twilight. Two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar against any possible infiltration of the day.

“Embryos are like photograph film,” said Mr. Foster waggishly, as he pushed open the second door. “They can only stand red light.”

And in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer's afternoon. The bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies, and among the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. The hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air.

“Give them a few figures, Mr. Foster,” said the Director, who was tired of talking.

Mr. Foster was only too happy to give them a few figures.

Two hundred and twenty metres long, two hundred wide, ten high. He pointed upwards. Like chickens drinking, the students lifted their eyes towards the distant ceiling.

Three tiers of racks: ground floor level, first gallery, second gallery.

The spidery steel-work of gallery above gallery faded away in all directions into the dark. Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading demijohns from a moving staircase.

The escalator from the Social Predestination Room.

Each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks, each rack, though you couldn't see it, was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty-three and a third centimetres an hour. Two hundred and sixty-seven days at eight metres a day. Two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in all. One circuit of the cellar at ground level, one on the first gallery, half on the second, and on the two hundred and sixty-seventh morning, daylight in the Decanting Room. Independent existence—so called.

“But in the interval,” Mr. Foster concluded, “we've managed to do a lot to them. Oh, a very great deal.” His laugh was knowing and triumphant.

“That's the spirit I like,” said the Director once more. “Let's walk around. You tell them everything, Mr. Foster.”

Mr. Foster duly told them.

Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. Made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed. Explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. Told them of the corpus luteum extract. Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected. Spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their course. Described the artificial maternal circulation installed in every bottle at Metre 112; showed them the reservoir of blood-surrogate, the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste product filter. Referred to the embryo's troublesome tendency to anaemia, to the massive doses of hog's stomach extract and foetal foal's liver with which, in consequence, it had to be supplied.

Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during the last two metres out of every eight, all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into familiarity with movement. Hinted at the gravity of the so-called “trauma of decanting,” and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a suitable training of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. Told them of the test for sex carried out in the neighborhood of Metre 200. Explained the system of labelling—a T for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark, black on a white ground.

“For of course,” said Mr. Foster, “in the vast majority of cases, fertility is merely a nuisance. One fertile ovary in twelve hundred—that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes. But we want to have a good choice. And of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety. So we allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally. The others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the rest of the course. Result: they're decanted as freemartins—structurally quite normal (except,” he had to admit, “that they do have the slightest tendency to grow beards), but sterile. Guaranteed sterile. Which brings us at last,” continued Mr. Foster, “out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention.”

He rubbed his hands. For of course, they didn't content themselves with merely hatching out embryos: any cow could do that.

“We also predestine and condition. We decant our babies as socialized human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future…” He was going to say “future World controllers,” but correcting himself, said “future Directors of Hatcheries” instead.

The D.H.C. acknowledged the compliment with a smile.

They were passing Metre 320 on Rack 11. A young Beta-Minus mechanic was busy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing bottle. The hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he turned the nuts. Down, down…A final twist, a glance at the revolution counter, and he was done. He moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump.

“Reducing the number of revolutions per minute,” Mr. Foster explained. “The surrogate goes round slower; therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. Nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par.” Again he rubbed his hands.

“But why do you want to keep the embryo below par?” asked an ingenuous student.

“Ass!” said the Director, breaking a long silence. “Hasn't it occurred to you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an Epsilon heredity?”

It evidently hadn't occurred to him. He was covered with confusion.

“The lower the caste,” said Mr. Foster, “the shorter the oxygen.” The first organ affected was the brain. After that the skeleton. At seventy per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. At less than seventy eyeless monsters.

“Who are no use at all,” concluded Mr. Foster.

Whereas (his voice became confidential and eager), if they could discover a technique for shortening the period of maturation, what a triumph, what a benefaction to Society!

“Consider the horse.”

They considered it.

Mature at six; the elephant at ten. While at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature; and is only full-grown at twenty. Hence, of course, that fruit of delayed development, the human intelligence.

“But in Epsilons,” said Mr. Foster very justly, “we don't need human intelligence.”

Didn't need and didn't get it. But though the Epsilon mind was mature at ten, the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. Long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity. If the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow's, what an enormous saving to the Community!

“Enormous!” murmured the students. Mr. Foster's enthusiasm was infectious.

He became rather technical; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co-ordination which made men grow so slowly; postulated a germinal mutation to account for it. Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone? Could the individual Epsilon embryo be made a revert, by a suitable technique, to the normality of dogs and cows? That was the problem. And it was all but solved.

Pilkington, at Mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full-grown at six and a half. A scientific triumph. But socially useless. Six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work. And the process was an all-or-nothing one; either you failed to modify at all, or else you modified the whole way. They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. So far without success. Mr. Foster sighed and shook his head.

Their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighborhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9. From this point onwards Rack 9 was enclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel, interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide.

“Heat conditioning,” said Mr. Foster.

Hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. Coolness was wedded to discomfort in the form of hard X-rays. By the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold. They were predestined to emigrate to the tropics, to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. Later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies. “We condition them to thrive on heat,” concluded Mr. Foster. “Our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it.”

“And that,” put in the Director sententiously, “that is the secret of happiness and virtue—liking what you've got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.”

In a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. The students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence.

“Well, Lenina,” said Mr. Foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up.

The girl turned with a start. One could see that, for all the lupus and the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty.

“Henry!” Her smile flashed redly at him—a row of coral teeth.

“Charming, charming,” murmured the Director and, giving her two or three little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself.

“What are you giving them?” asked Mr. Foster, making his tone very professional.

“Oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness.”

“Tropical workers start being inoculated at Metre 150,” Mr. Foster explained to the students. “The embryos still have gills. We immunize the fish against the future man's diseases.” Then, turning back to Lenina, “Ten to five on the roof this afternoon,” he said, “as usual.”

“Charming,” said the Director once more, and, with a final pat, moved away after the others.

On Rack 10 rows of next generation's chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead, caustic soda, tar, chlorine. The first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundredth metre mark on Rack 3. A special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation. “To improve their sense of balance,” Mr. Foster explained. “Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish job. We slacken off the circulation when they're right way up, so that they're half starved, and double the flow of surrogate when they're upside down. They learn to associate topsy-turvydom with well-being; in fact, they're only truly happy when they're standing on their heads.

“And now,” Mr. Foster went on, “I'd like to show you some very interesting conditioning for Alpha-Plus Intellectuals. We have a big batch of them on Rack 5. First Gallery level,” he called to two boys who had started to go down to the ground floor.

“They're round about Metre 900,” he explained. “You can't really do any useful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails. Follow me.”

But the Director had looked at his watch. “Ten to three,” he said. “No time for the intellectual embryos, I'm afraid. We must go up to the Nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep.”

Mr. Foster was disappointed. “At least one glance at the Decanting Room,” he pleaded.

“Very well then.” The Director smiled indulgently. “Just one glance.”





Chapter Two


Mr. Foster was left in the Decanting Room. The D.H.C. and his students stepped into the nearest lift and were carried up to the fifth floor.

INFANT NURSERIES. NEO-PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING ROOMS, announced the notice board.

The Director opened a door. They were in a large bare room, very bright and sunny; for the whole of the southern wall was a single window. Half a dozen nurses, trousered and jacketed in the regulation white viscose-linen uniform, their hair aseptically hidden under white caps, were engaged in setting out bowls of roses in a long row across the floor. Big bowls, packed tight with blossom. Thousands of petals, ripe-blown and silkily smooth, like the cheeks of innumerable little cherubs, but of cherubs, in that bright light, not exclusively pink and Aryan, but also luminously Chinese, also Mexican, also apoplectic with too much blowing of celestial trumpets, also pale as death, pale with the posthumous whiteness of marble.

The nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in.

“Set out the books,” he said curtly.

In silence the nurses obeyed his command. Between the rose bowls the books were duly set out—a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily-coloured image of beast or fish or bird.

“Now bring in the children.”

They hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki.

“Put them down on the floor.”

The infants were unloaded.

“Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books.”

Turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. From the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure.

The Director rubbed his hands. “Excellent!” he said. “It might almost have been done on purpose.”

The swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. Small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. The Director waited until all were happily busy. Then, “Watch carefully,” he said. And, lifting his hand, he gave the signal.

The Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever.

There was a violent explosion. Shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. Alarm bells maddeningly sounded.

The children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror.

“And now,” the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), “now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.”

He waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever.

The screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. There was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.

“We can electrify that whole strip of floor,” bawled the Director in explanation. “But that's enough,” he signalled to the nurse.

The explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. The stiffly twitching bodies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.

“Offer them the flowers and the books again.”

The nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror, the volume of their howling suddenly increased.

“Observe,” said the Director triumphantly, “observe.”

Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks—already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.

“They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an ‘instinctive’ hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They'll be safe from books and botany all their lives.” The Director turned to his nurses. “Take them away again.”

Still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence.

One of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-caste people wasting the Community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes, yet…well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. Why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers?

Patiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers—flowers in particular and wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport.

“And didn't they consume transport?” asked the student.

“Quite a lot,” the D.H.C. replied. “But nothing else.”

Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found.

“We condition the masses to hate the country,” concluded the Director. “But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. Hence those electric shocks.”

“I see,” said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration.

There was a silence; then, clearing his throat, “Once upon a time,” the Director began, “while Our Ford was still on earth, there was a little boy called Reuben Rabinovitch. Reuben was the child of Polish-speaking parents.”

The Director interrupted himself. “You know what Polish is, I suppose?”

“A dead language.”

“Like French and German,” added another student, officiously showing off his learning.

“And ‘parent’?” questioned the D.H.C.

There was an uneasy silence. Several of the boys blushed. They had not yet learned to draw the significant but often very fine distinction between smut and pure science. One, at last, had the courage to raise a hand.

“Human beings used to be…” he hesitated; the blood rushed to his cheeks. “Well, they used to be viviparous.”

“Quite right.” The Director nodded approvingly.

“And when the babies were decanted…”

‘“Born,”’came the correction.

“Well, then they were the parents—I mean, not the babies, of course; the other ones.” The poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion.

“In brief,” the Director summed up, “the parents were the father and the mother.” The smut that was really science fell with a crash into the boys' eye-avoiding silence. “Mother,” he repeated loudly rubbing in the science; and, leaning back in his chair, “These,” he said gravely, “are unpleasant facts; I know it. But then most historical facts are unpleasant.”

He returned to Little Reuben—to Little Reuben, in whose room, one evening, by an oversight, his father and mother (crash, crash!) happened to leave the radio turned on.

(“For you must remember that in those days of gross viviparous reproduction, children were always brought up by their parents and not in State Conditioning Centres.”)

While the child was asleep, a broadcast programme from London suddenly started to come through; and the next morning, to the astonishment of his crash and crash (the more daring of the boys ventured to grin at one another), Little Reuben woke up repeating word for word a long lecture by that curious old writer (“one of the very few whose works have been permitted to come down to us”), George Bernard Shaw, who was speaking, according to a well-authenticated tradition, about his own genius. To Little Reuben's wink and snigger, this lecture was, of course, perfectly incomprehensible and, imagining that their child had suddenly gone mad, they sent for a doctor. He, fortunately, understood English, recognized the discourse as that which Shaw had broadcasted the previous evening, realized the significance of what had happened, and sent a letter to the medical press about it.

“The principle of sleep-teaching, or hypnopaedia, had been discovered.” The D.H.C. made an impressive pause.

The principle had been discovered; but many, many years were to elapse before that principle was usefully applied.

“The case of Little Reuben occurred only twenty-three years after Our Ford's first T-Model was put on the market.” (Here the Director made a sign of the T on his stomach and all the students reverently followed suit.) “And yet…”

Furiously the students scribbled. “Hypnopaedia, first used officially in A.F. 214. Why not before? Two reasons. (a)…”

“These early experimenters,” the D.H.C. was saying, “were on the wrong track. They thought that hypnopaedia could be made an instrument of intellectual education…”

(A small boy asleep on his right side, the right arm stuck out, the right hand hanging limp over the edge of the bed. Through a round grating in the side of a box a voice speaks softly.

“The Nile is the longest river in Africa and the second in length of all the rivers of the globe. Although falling short of the length of the Mississippi-Missouri, the Nile is at the head of all rivers as regards the length of its basin, which extends through 35 degrees of latitude…”

At breakfast the next morning, “Tommy,” some one says, “do you know which is the longest river in Africa?” A shaking of the head. “But don't you remember something that begins: The Nile is the…”

“The—Nile—is—the—longest—river—in—Africa—and—the—second—in—length—of—all—the—rivers—of—the—globe…” The words come rushing out. “Although—falling—short—of…”

“Well now, which is the longest river in Africa?”

The eyes are blank. “I don't know.”

“But the Nile, Tommy.”

“The—Nile—is—the—longest—river—in—Africa—and—second…”

“Then which river is the longest, Tommy?”

Tommy burst into tears. “I don't know,” he howls.)

That howl, the Director made it plain, discouraged the earliest investigators. The experiments were abandoned. No further attempt was made to teach children the length of the Nile in their sleep. Quite rightly. You can't learn a science unless you know what it's all about.

“Whereas, if they'd only started on moral education,” said the Director, leading the way towards the door. The students followed him, desperately scribbling as they walked and all the way up in the lift. “Moral education, which ought never, in any circumstances, to be rational.”

“Silence, silence,” whispered a loud speaker as they stepped out at the fourteenth floor, and “Silence, silence,” the trumpet mouths indefatigably repeated at intervals down every corridor. The students and even the Director himself rose automatically to the tips of their toes. They were Alphas, of course, but even Alphas have been well conditioned. “Silence, silence.” All the air of the fourteenth floor was sibilant with the categorical imperative.

Fifty yards of tiptoeing brought them to a door which the Director cautiously opened. They stepped over the threshold into the twilight of a shuttered dormitory. Eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. There was a sound of light regular breathing and a continuous murmur, as of very faint voices remotely whispering.

A nurse rose as they entered and came to attention before the Director.

“What's the lesson this afternoon?” he asked.

“We had Elementary Sex for the first forty minutes,” she answered. “But now it's switched over to Elementary Class Consciousness.”

The Director walked slowly down the long line of cots. Rosy and relaxed with sleep, eighty little boys and girls lay softly breathing. There was a whisper under every pillow. The D.H.C. halted and, bending over one of the little beds, listened attentively.

“Elementary Class Consciousness, did you say? Let's have it repeated a little louder by the trumpet.”

At the end of the room a loud speaker projected from the wall. The Director walked up to it and pressed a switch.

“…all wear green,” said a soft but very distinct voice, beginning in the middle of a sentence, “and Delta Children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides, they wear black, which is such a beastly colour. I'm so glad I'm a Beta.”

There was a pause; then the voice began again.

“Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever. I'm really awfuly glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able…”

The Director pushed back the switch. The voice was silent. Only its thin ghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows.

“They'll have that repeated forty or fifty times more before they wake; then again on Thursday, and again on Saturday. A hundred and twenty times three times a week for thirty months. After which they go on to a more advanced lesson.”

Roses and electric shocks, the khaki of Deltas and a whiff of asafoetida—wedded indissolubly before the child can speak. But wordless conditioning is crude and wholesale; cannot bring home the finer distinctions, cannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour. For that there must be words, but words without reason. In brief, hypnopaedia.

“The greatest moralizing and socializing force of all time.”

The students took it down in their little books. Straight from the horse's mouth.

Once more the Director touched the switch.

“…so frightfully clever,” the soft, insinuating, indefatigable voice was saying, “I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because…”

Not so much like drops of water, though water, it is true, can wear holes in the hardest granite; rather, drops of liquid sealing-wax, drops that adhere, incrust, incorporate themselves with what they fall on, till finally the rock is all one scarlet blob.

“Till at last the child's mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the suggestions is the child's mind. And not the child's mind only. The adult's mind too—all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides—made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are our suggestions!” The Director almost shouted in his triumph. “Suggestions from the State.” He banged the nearest table. “It therefore follows…”

A noise made him turn round.

“Oh, Ford!” he said in another tone, “I've gone and woken the children.”





Chapter Three


Outside, in the garden, it was playtime. Naked in the warm June sunshine, six or seven hundred little boys and girls were running with shrill yells over the lawns, or playing ball games, or squatting silently in twos and threes among the flowering shrubs. The roses were in bloom, two nightingales soliloquized in the boskage, a cuckoo was just going out of tune among the lime trees. The air was drowsy with the murmur of bees and helicopters.

The Director and his students stood for a short time watching a game of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy. Twenty children were grouped in a circle round a chrome steel tower. A ball thrown up so as to land on the platform at the top of the tower rolled down into the interior, fell on a rapidly revolving disk, was hurled through one or other of the numerous apertures pierced in the cylindrical casing, and had to be caught.

“Strange,” mused the Director, as they turned away, “strange to think that even in Our Ford's day most games were played without more apparatus than a ball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of netting. Imagine the folly of allowing people to play elaborate games which do nothing whatever to increase consumption. It's madness. Nowadays the Controllers won't approve of any new game unless it can be shown that it requires at least as much apparatus as the most complicated of existing games.” He interrupted himself.

“That's a charming little group,” he said, pointing.

In a little grassy bay between tall clumps of Mediterranean heather, two children, a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a year older, were playing, very gravely and with all the focussed attention of scientists intent on a labour of discovery, a rudimentary sexual game.

“Charming, charming!” the D.H.C. repeated sentimentally.

“Charming,” the boys politely agreed. But their smile was rather patronizing. They had put aside similar childish amusements too recently to be able to watch them now without a touch of contempt. Charming? but it was just a pair of kids fooling about; that was all. Just kids.

“I always think,” the Director was continuing in the same rather maudlin tone, when he was interrupted by a loud boo-hooing.

From a neighbouring shrubbery emerged a nurse, leading by the hand a small boy, who howled as he went. An anxious-looking little girl trotted at her heels.

“What's the matter?” asked the Director.

The nurse shrugged her shoulders. “Nothing much,” she answered. “It's just that this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordinary erotic play. I'd noticed it once or twice before. And now again to-day. He started yelling just now…”

“Honestly,” put in the anxious-looking little girl, “I didn't mean to hurt him or anything. Honestly.”

“Of course you didn't, dear,” said the nurse reassuringly. “And so,” she went on, turning back to the Director, “I'm taking him in to see the Assistant Superintendent of Psychology. Just to see if anything's at all abnormal.”

“Quite right,” said the Director. “Take him in. You stay here, little girl,” he added, as the nurse moved away with her still howling charge. “What's your name?”

“Polly Trotsky.”

“And a very good name too,” said the Director. “Run away now and see if you can find some other little boy to play with.”

The child scampered off into the bushes and was lost to sight.

“Exquisite little creature!” said the Director, looking after her. Then, turning to his students, “What I'm going to tell you now,” he said, “may sound incredible. But then, when you're not accustomed to history, most facts about the past do sound incredible.”

He let out the amazing truth. For a very long period before the time of Our Ford, and even for some generations afterwards, erotic play between children had been regarded as abnormal (there was a roar of laughter); and not only abnormal, actually immoral (no!): and had therefore been rigorously suppressed.

A look of astonished incredulity appeared on the faces of his listeners. Poor little kids not allowed to amuse themselves? They could not believe it.

“Even adolescents,” the D.H.C. was saying, “even adolescents like yourselves…”

“Not possible!”

“Barring a little surreptitious auto-erotism and homosexuality—absolutely nothing.”

“Nothing?”

“In most cases, till they were over twenty years old.”

“Twenty years old?” echoed the students in a chorus of loud disbelief.

“Twenty,” the Director repeated. “I told you that you'd find it incredible.”

“But what happened?” they asked. “What were the results?”

“The results were terrible.” A deep resonant voice broke startlingly into the dialogue.

They looked around. On the fringe of the little group stood a stranger—a man of middle height, black-haired, with a hooked nose, full red lips, eyes very piercing and dark. “Terrible,” he repeated.

The D.H.C. had at that moment sat down on one of the steel and rubber benches conveniently scattered through the gardens; but at the sight of the stranger, he sprang to his feet and darted forward, his hand outstretched, smiling with all his teeth, effusive.

“Controller! What an unexpected pleasure! Boys, what are you thinking of? This is the Controller; this is his fordship, Mustapha Mond.”




In the four thousand rooms of the Centre the four thousand electric clocks simultaneously struck four. Discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths.

“Main Day-shift off duty. Second Day-shift take over. Main Day-shift off…”

In the lift, on their way up to the changing rooms, Henry Foster and the Assistant Director of Predestination rather pointedly turned their backs on Bernard Marx from the Psychology Bureau: averted themselves from that unsavoury reputation.

The faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in the Embryo Store. Shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face give place to another; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept forward with their load of future men and women.

Lenina Crowne walked briskly towards the door.




His fordship Mustapha Mond! The eyes of the saluting students almost popped out of their heads. Mustapha Mond! The Resident Controller for Western Europe! One of the Ten World Controllers. One of the Ten…and he sat down on the bench with the D.H.C, he was going to stay, to stay, yes, and actually talk to them…straight from the horse's mouth. Straight from the mouth of Ford himself.

Two shrimp-brown children emerged from a neighbouring shrubbery, stared at them for a moment with large, astonished eyes, then returned to their amusements among the leaves.

“You all remember,” said the Controller, in his strong deep voice, “you all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford's: History is bunk. History,” he repeated slowly, “is bunk.”

He waved his hand; and it was as though, with an invisible feather wisk, he had brushed away a little dust, and the dust was Harappa, was Ur of the Chaldees; some spider-webs, and they were Thebes and Babylon and Cnossos and Mycenae. Whisk. Whisk—and where was Odysseus, where was Job, where were Jupiter and Gotama and Jesus? Whisk—and those specks of antique dirt called Athens and Rome, Jerusalem and the Middle Kingdom—all were gone. Whisk—the place where Italy had been was empty. Whisk, the cathedrals; whisk, whisk, King Lear and the Thoughts of Pascal. Whisk, Passion; whisk, Requiem; whisk, Symphony; whisk…




“Going to the Feelies this evening, Henry?” enquired the Assistant Predestinator. “I hear the new one at the Alhambra is first-rate. There's a love scene on a bearskin rug; they say it's marvellous. Every hair of the bear reproduced. The most amazing tactual effects.”




“That's why you're taught no history,” the Controller was saying. “But now the time has come…”

The D.H.C. looked at him nervously. There were those strange rumours of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the Controller's study. Bibles, poetry—Ford knew what.

Mustapha Mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his red lips twitched ironically.

“It's all right, Director,” he said in a tone of faint derision, “I won't corrupt them.”

The D.H.C. was overwhelmed with confusion.




Those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. The smile on Bernard Marx's face was contemptuous. Every hair on the bear indeed!

“I shall make a point of going,” said Henry Foster.




Mustapha Mond leaned forward, shook a finger at them. “Just try to realize it,” he said, and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along their diaphragms. “Try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous mother.”

That smutty word again. But none of them dreamed, this time, of smiling.

“Try to imagine what ‘living with one's family’ meant.”

They tried; but obviously without the smallest success.

“And do you know what a ‘home’ was?”

They shook their heads.

*

From her dim crimson cellar Lenina Crowne shot up seventeen stories, turned to the right as she stepped out of the lift, walked down a long corridor and, opening the door marked GIRLS' DRESSING-ROOM, plunged into a deafening chaos of arms and bosoms and underclothing. Torrents of hot water were splashing into or gurgling out of a hundred baths. Rumbling and hissing, eighty vibro-vacuum massage machines were simultaneously kneading and sucking the firm and sun-burnt flesh of eighty superb female specimens. Every one was talking at the top of her voice. A Synthetic Music machine was warbling out a super-cornet solo.

“Hullo, Fanny,” said Lenina to the young woman who had the pegs and locker next to hers.

Fanny worked in the Bottling Room, and her surname was also Crowne. But as the two thousand million inhabitants of the plant had only ten thousand names between them, the coincidence was not particularly surprising.

Lenina pulled at her zippers—downwards on the jacket, downwards with a double-handed gesture at the two that held trousers, downwards again to loosen her undergarment. Still wearing her shoes and stockings, she walked off towards the bathrooms.




Home, home—a few small rooms, stiflingly over-inhabited by a man, by a periodically teeming woman, by a rabble of boys and girls of all ages. No air, no space; an understerilized prison; darkness, disease, and smells.

(The Controller's evocation was so vivid that one of the boys, more sensitive than the rest, turned pale at the mere description and was on the point of being sick.)




Lenina got out of the bath, toweled herself dry, took hold of a long flexible tube plugged into the wall, presented the nozzle to her breast, as though she meant to commit suicide, pressed down the trigger. A blast of warmed air dusted her with the finest talcum powder. Eight different scents and eau-de-Cologne were laid on in little taps over the wash-basin. She turned on the third from the left, dabbed herself with chypre and, carrying her shoes and stockings in her hand, went out to see if one of the vibro-vacuum machines were free.




And home was as squalid psychically as physically. Psychically, it was a rabbit hole, a midden, hot with the frictions of tightly packed life, reeking with emotion. What suffocating intimacies, what dangerous, insane, obscene relationships between the members of the family group! Maniacally, the mother brooded over her children (her children)…brooded over them like a cat over its kittens; but a cat that could talk, a cat that could say, “My baby, my baby,” over and over again. “My baby, and oh, oh, at my breast, the little hands, the hunger, and that unspeakable agonizing pleasure! Till at last my baby sleeps, my baby sleeps with a bubble of white milk at the corner of his mouth. My little baby sleeps…”

“Yes,” said Mustapha Mond, nodding his head, “you may well shudder.”




“Who are you going out with to-night?” Lenina asked, returning from the vibro-vac like a pearl illuminated from within, pinkly glowing.

“Nobody.”

Lenina raised her eyebrows in astonishment.

“I've been feeling rather out of sorts lately,” Fanny explained. “Dr. Wells advised me to have a Pregnancy Substitute.”

“But, my dear, you're only nineteen. The first Pregnancy Substitute isn't compulsory till twenty-one.”

“I know, dear. But some people are better if they begin earlier. Dr. Wells told me that brunettes with wide pelvises, like me, ought to have their first Pregnancy Substitute at seventeen. So I'm really two years late, not two years early.” She opened the door of her locker and pointed to the row of boxes and labelled phials on the upper shelf.

“SYRUP OF CORPUS LUTEUM,” Lenina read the names aloud. “OVARIN, GUARANTEED FRESH: NOT TO BE USED AFTER AUGUST 1ST, A.F. 632. MAMMARY GLAND EXTRACT: TO BE TAKEN THREE TIMES DAILY, BEFORE MEALS, WITH A LITTLE WATER. PLACENTIN: 5cc TO BE INJECTED INTRAVENALLY EVERY THIRD DAY…Ugh!” Lenina shuddered. “How I loathe intravenals, don't you?”

“Yes. But when they do one good…” Fanny was a particularly sensible girl.




Our Ford—or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters—Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. The world was full of fathers—was therefore full of misery; full of mothers—therefore of every kind of perversion from sadism to chastity; full of brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts—full of madness and suicide.

“And yet, among the savages of Samoa, in certain islands off the coast of New Guinea…”

The tropical sunshine lay like warm honey on the naked bodies of children tumbling promiscuously among the hibiscus blossoms. Home was in any one of twenty palm-thatched houses. In the Trobriands conception was the work of ancestral ghosts; nobody had ever heard of a father.

“Extremes,” said the Controller, “meet. For the good reason that they were made to meet.”




“Dr. Wells says that a three months' Pregnancy Substitute now will make all the difference to my health for the next three or four years.”

“Well, I hope he's right,” said Lenina. “But, Fanny, do you really mean to say that for the next three months you're not supposed to…”

“Oh no, dear. Only for a week or two, that's all. I shall spend the evening at the Club playing Musical Bridge. I suppose you're going out?”

Lenina nodded.

“Who with?”

“Henry Foster.”

“Again?” Fanny's kind, rather moon-like face took on an incongruous expression of pained and disapproving astonishment. “Do you mean to tell me you're still going out with Henry Foster?”




Mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. But there were also husbands, wives, lovers. There were also monogamy and romance.

“Though you probably don't know what those are,” said Mustapha Mond.

They shook their heads.

Family, monogamy, romance. Everywhere exclusiveness, everywhere a focussing of interest, a narrow channelling of impulse and energy.

“But every one belongs to every one else,” he concluded, citing the hypnopaedic proverb.

The students nodded, emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards of sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept, not merely as true, but as axiomatic, self-evident, utterly indisputable.




“But after all,” Lenina was protesting, “it's only about four months now since I've been having Henry.”

“Only four months! I like that. And what's more,” Fanny went on, pointing an accusing finger, “there's been nobody else except Henry all that time. Has there?”

Lenina blushed scarlet; but her eyes, the tone of her voice remained defiant. “No, there hasn't been any one else,” she answered almost truculently. “And I jolly well don't see why there should have been.”

“Oh, she jolly well doesn't see why there should have been,” Fanny repeated, as though to an invisible listener behind Lenina's left shoulder. Then, with a sudden change of tone, “But seriously,” she said, “I really do think you ought to be careful. It's such horribly bad form to go on and on like this with one man. At forty, or thirty-five, it wouldn't be so bad. But at your age, Lenina! No, it really won't do. And you know how strongly the D.H.C. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. Four months of Henry Foster, without having another man—why, he'd be furious if he knew…”

*

“Think of water under pressure in a pipe.” They thought of it. “I pierce it once,” said the Controller. “What a jet!”

He pierced it twenty times. There were twenty piddling little fountains.

“My baby. My baby…!”

“Mother!” The madness is infectious.

“My love, my one and only, precious, precious…”

Mother, monogamy, romance. High spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. The urge has but a single outlet. My love, my baby. No wonder these poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. Their world didn't allow them to take things easily, didn't allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. What with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the poverty—they were forced to feel strongly. And feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable?




“Of course there's no need to give him up. Have somebody else from time to time, that's all. He has other girls, doesn't he?”

Lenina admitted it.

“Of course he does. Trust Henry Foster to be the perfect gentleman—always correct. And then there's the Director to think of. You know what a stickler…”

Nodding, “He patted me on the behind this afternoon,” said Lenina.

“There, you see!” Fanny was triumphant. “That shows what he stands for. The strictest conventionality.”




“Stability,” said the Controller, “stability. No civilization without social stability. No social stability without individual stability.” His voice was a trumpet. Listening, they felt larger, warmer.

The machine turns, turns and must keep on turning—for ever. It is death if it stands still. A thousand millions scrabbled the crust of the earth. The wheels began to turn. In a hundred and fifty years there were two thousand millions. Stop all the wheels. In a hundred and fifty weeks there are once more only a thousand millions; a thousand thousand thousand men and women have starved to death.

Wheels must turn steadily, but cannot turn untended. There must be men to tend them, men as steady as the wheels upon their axles, sane men, obedient men, stable in contentment.

Crying: My baby, my mother, my only, only love; groaning: My sin, my terrible God; screaming with pain, muttering with fever, bemoaning old age and poverty—how can they tend the wheels? And if they cannot tend the wheels…The corpses of a thousand thousand thousand men and women would be hard to bury or burn.




“And after all,” Fanny's tone was coaxing, “it's not as though there were anything painful or disagreeable about having one or two men besides Henry. And seeing that you ought to be a little more promiscuous…”




“Stability,” insisted the Controller, “stability. The primal and the ultimate need. Stability. Hence all this.”

With a wave of his hand he indicated the gardens, the huge building of the Conditioning Centre, the naked children furtive in the undergrowth or running across the lawns.




Lenina shook her head. “Somehow,” she mused, “I hadn't been feeling very keen on promiscuity lately. There are times when one doesn't. Haven't you found that too, Fanny?”

Fanny nodded her sympathy and understanding. “But one's got to make the effort,” she said, sententiously, “one's got to play the game. After all, every one belongs to every one else.”

“Yes, every one belongs to every one else,” Lenina repeated slowly and, sighing, was silent for a moment; then, taking Fanny's hand, gave it a little squeeze. “You're quite right, Fanny. As usual. I'll make the effort.”

*

Impulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is passion, the flood is even madness: it depends on the force of the current, the height and strength of the barrier. The unchecked stream flows smoothly down its appointed channels into a calm well-being. The embryo is hungry; day in, day out, the blood-surrogate pump unceasingly turns its eight hundred revolutions a minute. The decanted infant howls; at once a nurse appears with a bottle of external secretion. Feeling lurks in that interval of time between desire and its consummation. Shorten that interval, break down all those old unnecessary barriers.

“Fortunate boys!” said the Controller. “No pains have been spared to make your lives emotionally easy—to preserve you, so far as that is possible, from having emotions at all.”

“Ford's in his flivver,” murmured the D.H.C. “All's well with the world.”




“Lenina Crowne?” said Henry Foster, echoing the Assistant Predestinator's question as he zipped up his trousers. “Oh, she's a splendid girl. Wonderfully pneumatic. I'm surprised you haven't had her.”

“I can't think how it is I haven't,” said the Assistant Predestinator. “I certainly will. At the first opportunity.”

From his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle, Bernard Marx overheard what they were saying and turned pale.




“And to tell the truth,” said Lenina, “I'm beginning to get just a tiny bit bored with nothing but Henry every day.” She pulled on her left stocking. “Do you know Bernard Marx?” she asked in a tone whose excessive casualness was evidently forced.

Fanny looked startled. “You don't mean to say…?”

“Why not? Bernard's an Alpha Plus. Besides, he asked me to go to one of the Savage Reservations with him. I've always wanted to see a Savage Reservation.”

“But his reputation?”

“What do I care about his reputation?”

“They say he doesn't like Obstacle Golf.”

“They say, they say,” mocked Lenina.

“And then he spends most of his time by himself—alone.” There was horror in Fanny's voice.

“Well, he won't be alone when he's with me. And anyhow, why are people so beastly to him? I think he's rather sweet.” She smiled to herself; how absurdly shy he had been! Frightened almost—as though she were a World Controller and he a Gamma-Minus machine minder.




“Consider your own lives,” said Mustapha Mond. “Has any of you ever encountered an insurmountable obstacle?”

The question was answered by a negative silence.

“Has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval between the consciousness of a desire and its fufilment?”

“Well,” began one of the boys, and hesitated.

“Speak up,” said the D.H.C. “Don't keep his fordship waiting.”

“I once had to wait nearly four weeks before a girl I wanted would let me have her.”

“And you felt a strong emotion in consequence?”

“Horrible!”

“Horrible; precisely,” said the Controller. “Our ancestors were so stupid and short-sighted that when the first reformers came along and offered to deliver them from those horrible emotions, they wouldn't have anything to do with them.”




“Talking about her as though she were a bit of meat.” Bernard ground his teeth. “Have her here, have her there.” Like mutton. Degrading her to so much mutton. She said she'd think it over, she said she'd give me an answer this week. Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford.” He would have liked to go up to them and hit them in the face—hard, again and again.

“Yes, I really do advise you to try her,” Henry Foster was saying.

*

“Take Ectogenesis. Pfitzner and Kawaguchi had got the whole technique worked out. But would the Governments look at it? No. There was something called Christianity. Women were forced to go on being viviparous.”




“He's so ugly!” said Fanny.

“But I rather like his looks.”

“And then so small.” Fanny made a grimace; smallness was so horribly and typically low-caste.

“I think that's rather sweet,” said Lenina. “One feels one would like to pet him. You know. Like a cat.”

Fanny was shocked. “They say somebody made a mistake when he was still in the bottle—thought he was a Gamma and put alcohol into his blood-surrogate. That's why he's so stunted.”

“What nonsense!” Lenina was indignant.




“Sleep teaching was actually prohibited in England. There was something called liberalism. Parliament, if you know what that was, passed a law against it. The records survive. Speeches about liberty of the subject. Liberty to be inefficient and miserable. Freedom to be a round peg in a square hole.”




“But, my dear chap, you're welcome, I assure you. You're welcome.” Henry Foster patted the Assistant Predestinator on the shoulder. “Every one belongs to every one else, after all.”




One hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years, thought Bernard Marx, who was a specialist on hypnopaedia. Sixty-two thousand four hundred repetitions make one truth. Idiots!




“Or the Caste System. Constantly proposed, constantly rejected. There was something called democracy. As though men were more than physico-chemically equal.”

*

“Well, all I can say is that I'm going to accept his invitation.”




Bernard hated them, hated them. But they were two, they were large, they were strong.




“The Nine Years' War began in A.F. 141.”




“Not even if it were true about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate.”




“Phosgene, chloropicrin, ethyl iodoacetate, diphenylcyanarsine, trichlormethyl, chloroformate, dichlorethyl sulphide. Not to mention hydrocyanic acid.”




“Which I simply don't believe,” Lenina concluded.




“The noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. But in the Kurfurstendamm and the Eighth Arrondissement, the explosion of the anthrax bombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.”




“Because I do want to see a Savage Reservation.”

CH3C6H2 (NO2)3+Hg(CNO)2=well, what? An enormous hole in the ground, a pile of masonry, some bits of flesh and mucus, a foot, with the boot still on it, flying through the air and landing, flop, in the middle of the geraniums—the scarlet ones; such a splendid show that summer!




“You're hopeless, Lenina, I give you up.”




“The Russian technique for infecting water supplies was particularly ingenious.”




Back turned to back, Fanny and Lenina continued their changing in silence.

“The Nine Years' War, the great Economic Collapse. There was a choice between World Control and destruction. Between stability and…”




“Fanny Crowne's a nice girl too,” said the Assistant Predestinator.




In the nurseries, the Elementary Class Consciousness lesson was over, the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. “I do love flying,” they whispered, “I do love flying, I do love having new clothes, I do love…”




“Liberalism, of course, was dead of anthrax, but all the same you couldn't do things by force.”




“Not nearly so pneumatic as Lenina. Oh, not nearly.”




“But old clothes are beastly,” continued the untiring whisper. “We always throw away old clothes. Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending, ending is better…”




“Government's an affair of sitting, not hitting. You rule with the brains and the buttocks, never with the fists. For example, there was the conscription of consumption.”




“There, I'm ready,” said Lenina, but Fanny remained speechless and averted. “Let's make peace, Fanny darling.”




“Every man, woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. In the interests of industry. The sole result…”




“Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches; the more stitches…”




*

“One of these days,” said Fanny, with dismal emphasis, “you'll get into trouble.”




“Conscientious objection on an enormous scale. Anything not to consume. Back to nature.”




“I do love flying. I do love flying.”




“Back to culture. Yes, actually to culture. You can't consume much if you sit still and read books.”




“Do I look all right?” Lenina asked. Her jacket was made of bottle-green acetate cloth with green viscose fur at the cuffs and collar.




“Eight hundred Simple Lifers were mowed down by machine guns at Golders Green.”




“Ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending.”




Green corduroy shorts and white viscose-woollen stockings turned down below the knee.




“Then came the famous British Museum Massacre. Two thousand culture fans gassed with dichlorethyl sulphide.”




A green-and-white jockey cap shaded Lenina's eyes; her shoes were bright green and highly polished.




“In the end,” said Mustapha Mond, “the Controllers realized that force was no good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopaedia…”




*

And round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt, bulging (for Lenina was not a freemartin) with the regulation supply of contraceptives.




“The discoveries of Pfitzner and Kawaguchi were at last made use of. An intensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction…”




“Perfect!” cried Fanny enthusiastically. She could never resist Lenina's charm for long. “And what a perfectly sweet Malthusian belt!”




“Accompanied by a campaign against the Past; by the closing of museums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the Nine Years' War); by the suppression of all books published before A.F. 150.”




“I simply must get one like it,” said Fanny.




“There were some things called the pyramids, for example.




“My old black-patent bandolier…”




“And a man called Shakespeare. You've never heard of them, of course.”




“It's an absolute disgrace—that bandolier of mine.”




“Such are the advantages of a really scientific education.”




“The more stitches the less riches; the more stitches the less…”




“The introduction of Our Ford's first T-Model…”




“I've had it nearly three months.”




*

“Chosen as the opening date of the new era.”




“Ending is better than mending; ending is better…”




“There was a thing, as I've said before, called Christianity.”




“Ending is better than mending.”




“The ethics and philosophy of under-consumption…”




“I love new clothes, I love new clothes, I love…”




“So essential when there was under-production; but in an age of machines and the fixation of nitrogen—positively a crime against society.”




“Henry Foster gave it me.”




“All crosses had their tops cut and became T's. There was also a thing called God.”




“It's real morocco-surrogate.”




“We have the World State now. And Ford's Day celebrations, and Community Sings, and Solidarity Services.”




“Ford, how I hate them!” Bernard Marx was thinking.




“There was a thing called Heaven; but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.”




“Like meat, like so much meat.”

*

“There was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.”




“Do ask Henry where he got it.”




“But they used to take morphia and cocaine.”




“And what makes it worse, she thinks of herself as meat.”




“Two thousand pharmacologists and biochemists were subsidized in A. F. 178.”




“He does look glum,” said the Assistant Predestinator, pointing at Bernard Marx.




“Six years later it was being produced commercially. The perfect drug.”




“Let's bait him.”




“Euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant.”




“Glum, Marx, glum.” The clap on the shoulder made him start, look up. It was that brute Henry Foster. “What you need is a gramme of soma.”




“All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.”




“Ford, I should like to kill him!” But all he did was to say, “No, thank you,” and fend off the proffered tube of tablets.




“Take a holiday from reality whenever you like, and come back without so much as a headache or a mythology.”

*

“Take it,” insisted Henry Foster, “take it.”




“Stability was practically assured.”




“One cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments,” said the Assistant Predestinator citing a piece of homely hypnopaedic wisdom.




“It only remained to conquer old age.”




“Damn you, damn you!” shouted Bernard Marx.




“Hoity-toity.”




“Gonadal hormones, transfusion of young blood, magnesium salts…”




“And do remember that a gramme is better than a damn.” They went out, laughing.




“All the physiological stigmata of old age have been abolished. And along with them, of course…”




“Don't forget to ask him about that Malthusian belt,” said Fanny.




“Along with them all the old man's mental peculiarities. Characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.”




“…two rounds of Obstacle Golf to get through before dark. I must fly.”




“Work, play—at sixty our powers and tastes are what they were at seventeen. Old men in the bad old days used to renounce, retire, take to religion, spend their time reading, thinking—thinking!”




*

“Idiots, swine!” Bernard Marx was saying to himself, as he walked down the corridor to the lift.




“Now—such is progress—the old men work, the old men copulate, the old men have no time, no leisure from pleasure, not a moment to sit down and think—or if ever by some unlucky chance such a crevice of time should yawn in the solid substance of their distractions, there is always soma, delicious soma, half a gramme for a half-holiday, a gramme for a week-end, two grammes for a trip to the gorgeous East, three for a dark eternity on the moon; returning whence they find themselves on the other side of the crevice, safe on the solid ground of daily labour and distraction, scampering from feely to feely, from girl to pneumatic girl, from Electromagnetic Golf Course to…”

“Go away, little girl,” shouted the D.H.C. angrily. “Go away, little boy! Can't you see that his fordship's busy? Go and do your erotic play somewhere else.”




“Poor little children,” said the Controller.




Slowly, majestically, with a faint humming of machinery, the Conveyors moved forward, thirty-three centimters an hour. In the red darkness glinted innumerable rubies.





Chapter Four


1


The lift was crowded with men from the Alpha Changing Rooms, and Lenina's entry wars greeted by many friendly nods and smiles. She was a popular girl and, at one time or another, had spent a night with almost all of them.

They were dear boys, she thought, as she returned their salutations. Charming boys! Still, she did wish that George Edzel's ears weren't quite so big (perhaps he'd been given just a spot too much parathyroid at Metre 328?). And looking at Benito Hoover, she couldn't help remembering that he was really too hairy when he took his clothes off.

Turning, with eyes a little saddened by the recollection of Benito's curly blackness, she saw in a corner the small thin body, the melancholy face of Bernard Marx.

“Bernard!” she stepped up to him. “I was looking for you.” Her voice rang clear above the hum of the mounting lift. The others looked round curiously. “I wanted to talk to you about our New Mexico plan.” Out of the tail of her eye she could see Benito Hoover gaping with astonishment. The gape annoyed her. “Surprised I shouldn't be begging to go with him again!” she said to herself. Then aloud, and more warmly than ever, “I'd simply love to come with you for a week in July,” she went on. (Anyhow, she was publicly proving her unfaithfulness to Henry. Fanny ought to be pleased, even though it was Bernard.) “That is,” Lenina gave him her most deliciously significant smile, “if you still want to have me.”

Bernard's pale face flushed. “What on earth for?” she wondered, astonished, but at the same time touched by this strange tribute to her power.

“Hadn't we better talk about it somewhere else?” he stammered, looking horribly uncomfortable.

“As though I'd been saying something shocking,” thought Lenina. “He couldn't look more upset if I'd made a dirty joke—asked him who his mother was, or something like that.”

“I mean, with all these people about…” He was choked with confusion.

Lenina's laugh was frank and wholly unmalicious. “How funny you are!” she said; and she quite genuinely did think him funny. “You'll give me at least a week's warning, won't you,” she went on in another tone. “I suppose we take the Blue Pacific Rocket? Does it start from the Charing-T Tower? Or is it from Hampstead?”

Before Bernard could answer, the lift came to a standstill.

“Roof!” called a creaking voice.

The liftman was a small simian creature, dressed in the black tunic of an Epsilon-Minus Semi-Moron.

“Roof!”

He flung open the gates. The warm glory of afternoon sunlight made him start and blink his eyes. “Oh, roof!” he repeated in a voice of rapture. He was as though suddenly and joyfully awakened from a dark annihilating stupor. “Roof!”

He smiled up with a kind of doggily expectant adoration into the faces of his passengers. Talking and laughing together, they stepped out into the light. The liftman looked after them.

“Roof?” he said once more, questioningly.

Then a bell rang, and from the ceiling of the lift a loud speaker began, very softly and yet very imperiously, to issue its commands.

“Go down,” it said, “go down. Floor Eighteen. Go down, go down. Floor Eighteen. Go down, go…”

The liftman slammed the gates, touched a button and instantly dropped back into the droning twilight of the well, the twilight of his own habitual stupor.

It was warm and bright on the roof. The summer afternoon was drowsy with the hum of passing helicopters; and the deeper drone of the rocket-planes hastening, invisible, through the bright sky five or six miles overhead was like a caress on the soft air. Bernard Marx drew a deep breath. He looked up into the sky and round the blue horizon and finally down into Lenina's face.

“Isn't it beautiful!” His voice trembled a little.

She smiled at him with an expression of the most sympathetic understanding. “Simply perfect for Obstacle Golf,” she answered rapturously. “And now I must fly, Bernard. Henry gets cross if I keep him waiting. Let me know in good time about the date.” And waving her hand she ran away across the wide flat roof towards the hangars. Bernard stood watching the retreating twinkle of the white stockings, the sunburnt knees vivaciously bending and unbending again, again, and the softer rolling of those well-fitted corduroy shorts beneath the bottle green jacket. His face wore an expression of pain.

“I should say she was pretty,” said a loud and cheery voice just behind him.

Bernard started and looked around. The chubby red face of Benito Hoover was beaming down at him—beaming with manifest cordiality. Benito was notoriously good-natured. People said of him that he could have got through life without ever touching soma. The malice and bad tempers from which other people had to take holidays never afflicted him. Reality for Benito was always sunny.

“Pneumatic too. And how!” then, in another tone, “But, I say,” he went on, “you do look glum! What you need is a gramme of soma.” Diving into his right-hand trouser-pocket, Benito produced a phial. “One cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy…But, I say!”

Bernard had suddenly turned and rushed away.

Benito stared after him. “What can be the matter with the fellow?” he wondered, and, shaking his head, decided that the story about the alcohol having been put into the poor chap's blood-surrogate must be true. “Touched his brain, I suppose.”

He put away the soma bottle, and taking out a packet of sex-hormone chewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away towards the hangars, ruminating.

Henry Foster had had his machine wheeled out of its lock-up and, when Lenina arrived, was already seated in the cockpit, waiting.

“Four minutes late,” was all his comment, as she climbed in beside him. He started the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. The machine shot vertically into the air. Henry accelerated; the humming of the propeller shrilled from hornet to wasp, from wasp to mosquito; the speedometer showed that they were rising at the best part of two kilometres a minute. London diminished beneath them. The huge table-topped buildings were no more, in a few seconds, than a bed of geometrical mushrooms sprouting from the green of park and garden. In the midst of them, thin-stalked, a taller, slenderer fungus, the Charing-T Tower lifted towards the sky a disk of shining concrete.

Like the vague torsos of fabulous athletes, huge fleshy clouds lolled on the blue air above their heads. Out of one of them suddenly dropped a small scarlet insect, buzzing as it fell.

“There's the Red Rocket,” said Henry, “just come in from New York.” Looking at his watch. “Seven minutes behind time,” he added, and shook his head. “These Atlantic services—they're really scandalously unpunctual.”

He took his foot off the accelerator. The humming of the screws overhead dropped an octave and a half, back through wasp and hornet to bumble-bee, to cockchafer, to stag-beetle. The upward rush of the machine slackened off; a moment later they were hanging motionless in the air. Henry pushed at a lever; there was a click. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, till it was a circular mist before their eyes, the propeller in front of them began to revolve. The wind of a horizontal speed whistled ever more shrilly in the stays. Henry kept his eye on the revolution-counter; when the needle touched the twelve hundred mark, he threw the helicopter screws out of gear. The machine had enough forward momentum to be able to fly on its planes.

Lenina looked down through the window in the floor between her feet. They were flying over the six kilometre zone of park-land that separated Central London from its first ring of satellite suburbs. The green was maggoty with fore-shortened life. Forests of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy towers gleamed between the trees. Near Shepherd's Bush two thousand Beta-Minus mixed doubles were playing Riemann-surface tennis. A double row of Escalator Fives Courts lined the main road from Notting Hill to Willesden. In the Ealing stadium a Delta gymnastic display and Community Sing was in progress.

“What a hideous colour khaki is,” remarked Lenina, voicing the hypnopaedic prejudices of her caste.

The buildings of the Hounslow Feely Studio covered seven and a half hectares. Near them a black and khaki army of labourers was busy revitrifying the surface of the Great West Road. One of the huge travelling crucibles was being tapped as they flew over. The molten stone poured out in a stream of dazzling incandescence across the road, the asbestos rollers came and went; at the tail of an insulated watering cart the steam rose in white clouds.

At Brentford the Television Corporation's factory was like a small town.

“They must be changing the shift,” said Lenina.

Like aphides and ants, the leaf-green Gamma girls, the black Semi-Morons swarmed round the entrances, or stood in queues to take their places in the monorail tram-cars. Mulberry-coloured Beta-Minuses came and went among the crowd. The roof of the main building was alive with the alighting and departure of helicopters.

“My word,” said Lenina, “I'm glad I'm not a Gamma.”

Ten minutes later they were at Stoke Poges and had started their first round of Obstacle Golf.





2


With eyes for the most part downcast and, if ever they lighted on a fellow creature, at once and furtively averted, Bernard hastened across the roof. He was like a man pursued, but pursued by enemies he does not wish to see, lest they should seem more hostile even than he had supposed, and he himself be made to feel guiltier and even more helplessly alone.

“That horrible Benito Hoover!” And yet the man had meant well enough. Which only made it, in a way, much worse. Those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly. Even Lenina was making him suffer. He remembered those weeks of timid indecision, during which he had looked and longed and despaired of ever having the courage to ask her. Dared he face the risk of being humiliated by a contemptuous refusal? But if she were to say yes, what rapture! Well, now she had said it and he was still wretched—wretched that she should have thought it such a perfect afternoon for Obstacle Golf, that she should have trotted away to join Henry Foster, that she should have found him funny for not wanting to talk of their most private affairs in public. Wretched, in a word, because she had behaved as any healthy and virtuous English girl ought to behave and not in some other, abnormal, extraordinary way.

He opened the door of his lock-up and called to a lounging couple of Delta-Minus attendants to come and push his machine out on to the roof. The hangars were staffed by a single Bokanovsky Group, and the men were twins, identically small, black and hideous. Bernard gave his orders in the sharp, rather arrogant and even offensive tone of one who does not feel himself too secure in his superiority. To have dealings with members of the lower castes was always, for Bernard, a most distressing experience. For whatever the cause (and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very likely—for accidents will happen—have been true) Bernard's physique as hardly better than that of the average Gamma. He stood eight centimetres short of the standard Alpha height and was slender in proportion. Contact with members of the lower castes always reminded him painfully of this physical inadequacy. “I am I, and wish I wasn't”; his self-consciousness was acute and stressing. Each time he found himself looking on the level, instead of downward, into a Delta's face, he felt humiliated. Would the creature treat him with the respect due to his caste? The question haunted him. Not without reason. For Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate corporeal mass with social superiority. Indeed, a faint hypnopaedic prejudice in favour of size was universal. Hence the laughter of the women to whom he made proposals, the practical joking of his equals among the men. The mockery made him feel an outsider; and feeling an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects. Which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. A chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals, made him stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his dignity. How bitterly he envied men like Henry Foster and Benito Hoover! Men who never had to shout at an Epsilon to get an order obeyed; men who took their position for granted; men who moved through the caste system as a fish through water—so utterly at home as to be unaware either of themselves or of the beneficent and comfortable element in which they had their being.

Slackly, it seemed to him, and with reluctance, the twin attendants wheeled his plane out on the roof.

“Hurry up!” said Bernard irritably. One of them glanced at him. Was that a kind of bestial derision that he detected in those blank grey eyes? “Hurry up!” he shouted more loudly, and there was an ugly rasp in his voice.

He climbed into the plane and, a minute later, was flying southwards, towards the river.

The various Bureaux of Propaganda and the College of Emotional Engineering were housed in a single sixty-story building in Fleet Street. In the basement and on the lower floors were the presses and offices of the three great London newspapers—The Hourly Radio, an upper-caste sheet, the pale-green Gamma Gazette, and, on khaki paper and in words exclusively of one syllable, The Delta Mirror. Then came the Bureaux of Propaganda by Television, by Feeling Picture, and by Synthetic Voice and Music respectively—twenty-two floors of them. Above were the research laboratories and the padded rooms in which Sound-Track Writers and Synthetic Composers did the delicate work. The top eighteen floors were occupied the College of Emotional Engineering.

Bernard landed on the roof of Propaganda House and stepped out.

“Ring down to Mr. Helmholtz Watson,” he ordered the Gamma-Plus porter, “and tell him that Mr. Bernard Marx is waiting for him on the roof.”

He sat down and lit a cigarette.

Helmholtz Watson was writing when the message came down.

“Tell him I'm coming at once,” he said and hung up the receiver. Then, turning to his secretary, “I'll leave you to put my things away,” he went on in the same official and impersonal tone; and, ignoring her lustrous smile, got up and walked briskly to the door.

He was a powerfully built man, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, massive, and yet quick in his movements, springy and agile. The round strong pillar of his neck supported a beautifully shaped head. His hair was dark and curly, his features strongly marked. In a forcible emphatic way, he was handsome and looked, as his secretary was never tired of repeating, every centimetre an Alpha-Plus. By profession he was a lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering (Department of Writing) and in the intervals of his educational activities, a working Emotional Engineer. He wrote regularly for The Hourly Radio, composed feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans and hypnopaedic rhymes.

“Able,” was the verdict of his superiors. “Perhaps” (and they would shake their heads, would significantly lower their voices) “a little too able.”

Yes, a little too able; they were right. A mental excess had produced in Helmholtz Watson effects very similar to those which, in Bernard Marx, were the result of a physical defect. Too little bone and brawn had isolated Bernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, being, by all the current standards, a mental excess, became in its turn a cause of wider separation. That which had made Helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much ability. What the two men shared was the knowledge that they were individuals. But whereas the physically defective Bernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate, it was only quite recently that, grown aware of his mental excess, Helmholtz Watson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded him. This Escalator-Squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years), this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned, second bests. Really, and at the bottom, he was interested in something else. But in what? In what? That was the problem which Bernard had come to discuss with him—or rather, since it was always Helmholtz who did all the talking, to listen to his friend discussing, yet once more.

Three charming girls from the Bureau of Propaganda by Synthetic Voice waylaid him as he stepped out of the lift.

“Oh, Helmholtz, darling, do come and have a picnic supper with us on Exmoor.” They clung round him imploringly.

He shook his head, he pushed his way through them. “No, no.”

“We're not inviting any other man.”

But Helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. “No,” he repeated, “I'm busy.” And he held resolutely on his course. The girls trailed after him. It was not till he had actually climbed into Bernard's plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. Not without reproaches.

“These women!” he said, as the machine rose into the air. “These women!” And he shook his head, he frowned. “Too awful,” Bernard hypocritically agreed, wishing, as he spoke the words, that he could have as many girls as Helmholtz did, and with as little trouble. He was seized with a sudden urgent need to boast. “I'm taking Lenina Crowne to New Mexico with me,” he said in a tone as casual as he could make it.

“Are you?” said Helmholtz, with a total absence of interest. Then after a little pause, “This last week or two,” he went on, “I've been cutting all my committees and all my girls. You can't imagine what a hullabaloo they've been making about it at the College. Still, it's been worth it, I think. The effects…” He hesitated. “Well, they're odd, they're very odd.”

A physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. The process, it seemed, was reversible. Mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism.

The rest of the short flight was accomplished in silence. When they had arrived and were comfortably stretched out on the pneumatic sofas in Bernard's room, Helmholtz began again.

Speaking very slowly, “Did you ever feel,” he asked, “as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? Some sort of extra power that you aren't using—you know, like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?” He looked at Bernard questioningly.

“You mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different?”

Helmholtz shook his head. “Not quite. I'm thinking of a queer feeling I sometimes get, a feeling that I've got something important to say and the power to say it—only I don't know what it is, and I can't make any use of the power. If there was some different way of writing…Or else something else to write about…” He was silent; then, “You see,” he went on at last, “I'm pretty good at inventing phrases—you know, the sort of words that suddenly make you jump, almost as though you'd sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even though they're about something hypnopaedically obvious. But that doesn't seem enough. It's not enough for the phrases to be good; what you make with them ought to be good too.”

“But your things are good, Helmholtz.”

“Oh, as far as they go.” Helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. “But they go such a little way. They aren't important enough, somehow. I feel I could do something much more important. Yes, and more intense, more violent. But what? What is there more important to say? And how can one be violent about the sort of things one's expected to write about? Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they'll go through anything. You read and you're pierced. That's one of the things I try to teach my students—how to write piercingly. But what on earth's the good of being pierced by an article about a Community Sing, or the latest improvement in scent organs? Besides, can you make words really piercing—you know, like the very hardest X-rays—when you're writing about that sort of thing? Can you say something about nothing? That's what it finally boils down to. I try and I try…”

“Hush!” said Bernard suddenly, and lifted a warning finger; they listened. “I believe there's somebody at the door,” he whispered.

Helmholtz got up, tiptoed across the room, and with a sharp quick movement flung the door wide open. There was, of course, nobody there.

“I'm sorry,” said Bernard, feeling and looking uncomfortably foolish. “I suppose I've got things on my nerves a bit. When people are suspicious with you, you start being suspicious with them.”

He passed his hand across his eyes, he sighed, his voice became plaintive. He was justifying himself. “If you knew what I'd had to put up with recently,” he said almost tearfully—and the uprush of his self-pity was like a fountain suddenly released. “If you only knew!”

Helmholtz Watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. “Poor little Bernard!” he said to himself. But at the same time he felt rather ashamed for his friend. He wished Bernard would show a little more pride.





Chapter Five


1


By eight o'clock the light was failing. The loud speaker in the tower of the Stoke Poges Club House began, in a more than human tenor, to announce the closing of the courses. Lenina and Henry abandoned their game and walked back towards the Club. From the grounds of the Internal and External Secretion Trust came the lowing of those thousands of cattle which provided, with their hormones and their milk, the raw materials for the great factory at Farnham Royal.

An incessant buzzing of helicopters filled the twilight. Every two and a half minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced the departure of one of the light monorail trains which carried the lower-caste golfers back from their separate course to the metropolis.

Lenina and Henry climbed into their machine and started off. At eight hundred feet Henry slowed down the helicopter screws, and they hung for a minute or two poised above the fading landscape. The forest of Burnham Beeches stretched like a great pool of darkness towards the bright shore of the western sky. Crimson at the horizon, the last of the sunset faded, through orange, upwards into yellow and a pale watery green. Northwards, beyond and above the trees, the Internal and External Secretions factory glared with a fierce electric brilliance from every window of its twenty stories. Beneath them lay the buildings of the Golf Club—the huge lower-caste barracks and, on the other side of a dividing wall, the smaller houses reserved for Alpha and Beta members. The approaches to the monorail station were black with the ant-like pullulation of lower-caste activity. From under the glass vault a lighted train shot out into the open. Following its south-easterly course across the dark plain their eyes were drawn to the majestic buildings of the Slough Crematorium. For the safety of night-flying planes, its four tall chimneys were flood-lighted and tipped with crimson danger signals. It was a landmark.

“Why do the smoke-stacks have those things like balconies around them?” enquired Lenina.

“Phosphorus recovery,” explained Henry telegraphically. “On their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. P2O5 used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. Now they recover over ninety-eight per cent of it. More than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. Which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorus every year from England alone.” Henry spoke with a happy pride, rejoicing wholeheartedly in the achievement, as though it had been his own. “Fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we're dead. Making plants grow.”

Lenina, meanwhile, had turned her eyes away and was looking perpendicularly downwards at the monorail station. “Fine,” she agreed. “But queer that Alphas and Betas won't make any more plants grow than those nasty little Gammas and Deltas and Epsilons down there.”

“All men are physico-chemically equal,” said Henry sententiously. “Besides, even Epsilons perform indispensable services.”

“Even an Epsilon…” Lenina suddenly remembered an occasion when, as a little girl at school, she had woken up in the middle of the night and become aware, for the first time, of the whispering that had haunted all her sleeps. She saw again the beam of moonlight, the row of small white beds; heard once more the soft, soft voice that said (the words were there, unforgotten, unforgettable after so many night-long repetitions): “Every one works for every one else. We can't do without any one. Even Epsilons are useful. We couldn't do without Epsilons. Every one works for every one else. We can't do without any one…” Lenina remembered her first shock of fear and surprise; her speculations through half a wakeful hour; and then, under the influence of those endless repetitions, the gradual soothing of her mind, the soothing, the smoothing, the stealthy creeping of sleep….

“I suppose Epsilons don't really mind being Epsilons,” she said aloud.

“Of course they don't. How can they? They don't know what it's like being anything else. We'd mind, of course. But then we've been differently conditioned. Besides, we start with a different heredity.”

“I'm glad I'm not an Epsilon,” said Lenina, with conviction.

“And if you were an Epsilon,” said Henry, “your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren't a Beta or an Alpha.” He put his forward propeller into gear and headed the machine towards London. Behind them, in the west, the crimson and orange were almost faded; a dark bank of cloud had crept into the zenith. As they flew over the Crematorium, the plane shot upwards on the column of hot air rising from the chimneys, only to fall as suddenly when it passed into the descending chill beyond.

“What a marvellous switchback!” Lenina laughed delightedly.

But Henry's tone was almost, for a moment, melancholy. “Do you know what that switchback was?” he said. “It was some human being finally and definitely disappearing. Going up in a squirt of hot gas. It would be curious to know who it was—a man or a woman, an Alpha or an Epsilon….” He sighed. Then, in a resolutely cheerful voice, “Anyhow,” he concluded, “there's one thing we can be certain of; whoever he may have been, he was happy when he was alive. Everybody's happy now.”

“Yes, everybody's happy now,” echoed Lenina. They had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years.

Landing on the roof of Henry's forty-story apartment house in Westminster, they went straight down to the dining-hall. There, in a loud and cheerful company, they ate an excellent meal. Soma was served with the coffee. Lenina took two half-gramme tablets and Henry three. At twenty past nine they walked across the street to the newly opened Westminster Abbey Cabaret. It was a night almost without clouds, moonless and starry; but of this on the whole depressing fact Lenina and Henry were fortunately unaware. The electric sky-signs effectively shut off the outer darkness. “CALVIN STOPES AND HIS SIXTEEN SEXOPHONISTS.” From the façade of the new Abbey the giant letters invitingly glared. “LONDON'S FINEST SCENT AND COLOUR ORGAN. ALL THE LATEST SYNTHETIC MUSIC.”

They entered. The air seemed hot and somehow breathless with the scent of ambergris and sandalwood. On the domed ceiling of the hall, the colour organ had momentarily painted a tropical sunset. The Sixteen Sexophonists were playing an old favourite: “There ain't no Bottle in all the world like that dear little Bottle of mine.” Four hundred couples were five-stepping round the polished floor. Lenina and Henry were soon the four hundred and first. The sexophones wailed like melodious cats under the moon, moaned in the alto and tenor registers as though the little death were upon them. Rich with a wealth of harmonics, their tremulous chorus mounted towards a climax, louder and ever louder—until at last, with a wave of his hand, the conductor let loose the final shattering note of ether-music and blew the sixteen merely human blowers clean out of existence. Thunder in A flat major. And then, in all but silence, in all but darkness, there followed a gradual deturgescence, a diminuendo sliding gradually, through quarter tones, down, down to a faintly whispered dominant chord that lingered on (while the five-four rhythms still pulsed below) charging the darkened seconds with an intense expectancy. And at last expectancy was fulfilled. There was a sudden explosive sunrise, and simultaneously, the Sixteen burst into song:

“Bottle of mine, it's you I've always wanted!

Bottle of mine, why was I ever decanted?

Skies are blue inside of you,

The weather's always fine;

For

There ain 't no Bottle in all the world

Like that dear little Bottle of mine.”

Five-stepping with the other four hundred round and round Westminster Abbey, Lenina and Henry were yet dancing in another world—the warm, the richly coloured, the infinitely friendly world of soma-holiday. How kind, how good-looking, how delightfully amusing every one was! “Bottle of mine, it's you I've always wanted…” But Lenina and Henry had what they wanted…They were inside, here and now—safely inside with the fine weather, the perennially blue sky. And when, exhausted, the Sixteen had laid by their sexophones and the Synthetic Music apparatus was producing the very latest in slow Malthusian Blues, they might have been twin embryos gently rocking together on the waves of a bottled ocean of blood-surrogate.

“Good-night, dear friends. Good-night, dear friends.” The loud speakers veiled their commands in a genial and musical politeness. “Good-night, dear friends…”

Obediently, with all the others, Lenina and Henry left the building. The depressing stars had travelled quite some way across the heavens. But though the separating screen of the sky-signs had now to a great extent dissolved, the two young people still retained their happy ignorance of the night.

Swallowing half an hour before closing time, that second dose of soma had raised a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe and their minds. Bottled, they crossed the street; bottled, they took the lift up to Henry's room on the twenty-eighth floor. And yet, bottled as she was, and in spite of that second gramme of soma, Lenina did not forget to take all the contraceptive precautions prescribed by the regulations. Years of intensive hypnopaedia and, from twelve to seventeen, Malthusian drill three times a week had made the taking of these precautions almost as automatic and inevitable as blinking.

“Oh, and that reminds me,” she said, as she came back from the bathroom, “Fanny Crowne wants to know where you found that lovely green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt you gave me.”

Alternate Thursdays were Bernard's Solidarity Service days. After an early dinner at the Aphroditaeum (to which Helrnholtz had recently been elected under Rule Two) he took leave of his friend and, hailing a taxi on the roof, told the man to fly to the Fordson Community Singery. The machine rose a couple of hundred metres, then headed eastwards, and as it turned, there before Bernard's eyes, gigantically beautiful, was the Singery. Flood-lighted, its three hundred and twenty metres of white Carrara-surrogate gleamed with a snowy incandescence over Ludgate Hill; at each of the four corners of its helicopter platform an immense T shone crimson against the night, and from the mouths of twenty-four vast golden trumpets rumbled a solemn synthetic music.

“Damn, I'm late,” Bernard said to himself as he first caught sight of Big Henry, the Singery clock. And sure enough, as he was paying off his cab, Big Henry sounded the hour. “Ford,” sang out an immense bass voice from all the golden trumpets. “Ford, Ford, Ford…” Nine times. Bernard ran for the lift.

The great auditorium for Ford's Day celebrations and other massed Community Sings was at the bottom of the building. Above it, a hundred to each floor, were the seven thousand rooms used by Solidarity Groups for their fortnightly services. Bernard dropped down to floor thirty-three, hurried along the corridor, stood hesitating for a moment outside Room 3210, then, having wound himself up, opened the door and walked in.

Thank Ford! he was not the last. Three chairs of the twelve arranged round the circular table were still unoccupied. He slipped into the nearest of them as inconspicuously as he could and prepared to frown at the yet later comers whenever they should arrive.

Turning towards him, “What were you playing this afternoon?” the girl on his left enquired. “Obstacle, or Electro-magnetic?”

Bernard looked at her (Ford! it was Morgana Rothschild) and blushingly had to admit that he had been playing neither. Morgana stared at him with astonishment. There was an awkward silence.

Then pointedly she turned away and addressed herself to the more sporting man on her left.

“A good beginning for a Solidarity Service,” thought Bernard miserably, and foresaw for himself yet another failure to achieve atonement. If only he had given himself time to look around instead of scuttling for the nearest chair! He could have sat between Fifi Bradlaugh and Joanna Diesel. Instead of which he had gone and blindly planted himself next to Morgana. Morgana! Ford! Those black eyebrows of hers—that eyebrow, rather—for they met above the nose. Ford! And on his right was Clara Deterding. True, Clara's eyebrows didn't meet. But she was really too pneumatic. Whereas Fifi and Joanna were absolutely right. Plump, blonde, not too large…And it was that great lout, Tom Kawaguchi, who now took the seat between them.

The last arrival was Sarojini Engels.

“You're late,” said the President of the Group severely. “Don't let it happen again.”

Sarojini apologized and slid into her place between Jim Bokanovsky and Herbert Bakunin. The group was now complete, the solidarity circle perfect and without flaw. Man, woman, man, in a ring of endless alternation round the table. Twelve of them ready to be made one, waiting to come together, to be fused, to lose their twelve separate identities in a larger being.

The President stood up, made the sign of the T and, switching on the synthetic music, let loose the soft indefatigable beating of drums and a choir of instruments—near-wind and super-string—that plangently repeated and repeated the brief and unescapably haunting melody of the first Solidarity Hymn. Again, again—and it was not the ear that heard the pulsating rhythm, it was the midriff; the wail and clang of those recurring harmonies haunted, not the mind, but the yearning bowels of compassion.

The President made another sign of the T and sat down. The service had begun. The dedicated soma tablets were placed in the centre of the table. The loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma was passed from hand to hand and, with the formula, “I drink to my annihilation,” twelve times quaffed. Then to the accompaniment of the synthetic orchestra the First Solidarity Hymn was sung.

“Ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one,

Like drops within the Social River,

Oh, make us now together run

As swiftly as thy shining Flivver.”

Twelve yearning stanzas. And then the loving cup was passed a second time. “I drink to the Greater Being” was now the formula. All drank. Tirelessly the music played. The drums beat. The crying and clashing of the harmonies were an obsession in the melted bowels. The Second Solidarity Hymn was sung.

“Come, Greater Being, Social Friend,

Annihilating Twelve-in-One!

We long to die, for when we end,

Our larger life has but begun.”

Again twelve stanzas. By this time the soma had begun to work. Eyes shone, cheeks were flushed, the inner light of universal benevolence broke out on every face in happy, friendly smiles. Even Bernard felt himself a little melted. When Morgana Rothschild turned and beamed at him, he did his best to beam back. But the eyebrow, that black two-in-one—alas, it was still there; he couldn't ignore it, couldn't, however hard he tried. The melting hadn't gone far enough. Perhaps if he had been sitting between Fifi and Joanna…For the third time the loving cup went round; “I drink to the imminence of His Coming,” said Morgana Rothschild, whose turn it happened to be to initiate the circular rite. Her tone was loud, exultant. She drank and passed the cup to Bernard. “I drink to the imminence of His Coming,” he repeated, with a sincere attempt to feel that the Coming was imminent; but the eyebrow continued to haunt him, and the Coming, so far as he was concerned, was horribly remote. He drank and handed the cup to Clara Deterding. “It'll be a failure again,” he said to himself. “I know it will.” But he went on doing his best to beam.

The loving cup had made its circuit. Lifting his hand, the President gave a signal; the chorus broke out into the Third Solidarity Hymn.

“Feel how the Greater Being comes!

Rejoice and, in rejoicings, die!

Melt in the music of the drums!

For I am you and you are I.”

As verse succeeded verse the voices thrilled with an ever intenser excitement. The sense of the Coming's imminence was like an electric tension in the air. The President switched off the music and, with the final note of the final stanza, there was absolute silence—the silence of stretched expectancy, quivering and creeping with a galvanic life. The President reached out his hand; and suddenly a Voice, a deep strong Voice, more musical than any merely human voice, richer, warmer, more vibrant with love and yearning and compassion, a wonderful, mysterious, supernatural Voice spoke from above their heads. Very slowly, “Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford,” it said diminishingly and on a descending scale. A sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the solar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened; tears came into their eyes; their hearts, their bowels seemed to move within them, as though with an independent life. “Ford!” they were melting, “Ford!” dissolved, dissolved. Then, in another tone, suddenly, startlingly. “Listen!” trumpeted the voice. “Listen!” They listened. After a pause, sunk to a whisper, but a whisper, somehow, more penetrating than the loudest cry. “The feet of the Greater Being,” it went on, and repeated the words: “The feet of the Greater Being.” The whisper almost expired. “The feet of the Greater Being are on the stairs.” And once more there was silence; and the expectancy, momentarily relaxed, was stretched again, tauter, tauter, almost to the tearing point. The feet of the Greater Being—oh, they heard them, they heard them, coming softly down the stairs, coming nearer and nearer down the invisible stairs. The feet of the Greater Being. And suddenly the tearing point was reached. Her eyes staring, her lips parted. Morgana Rothschild sprang to her feet.

“I hear him,” she cried. “I hear him.”

“He's coming,” shouted Sarojini Engels.

“Yes, he's coming, I hear him.” Fifi Bradlaugh and Tom Kawaguchi rose simultaneously to their feet.

“Oh, oh, oh!” Joanna inarticulately testified.

“He's coming!” yelled Jim Bokanovsky.

The President leaned forward and, with a touch, released a delirium of cymbals and blown brass, a fever of tom-tomming.

“Oh, he's coming!” screamed Clara Deterding. “Aie!” and it was as though she were having her throat cut.

Feeling that it was time for him to do something, Bernard also jumped up and shouted: “I hear him; He's coming.” But it wasn't true. He heard nothing and, for him, nobody was coming. Nobody—in spite of the music, in spite of the mounting excitement. But he waved his arms, he shouted with the best of them; and when the others began to jig and stamp and shuffle, he also jigged and shuffled.

Round they went, a circular procession of dancers, each with hands on the hips of the dancer preceding, round and round, shouting in unison, stamping to the rhythm of the music with their feet, beating it, beating it out with hands on the buttocks in front; twelve pairs of hands beating as one; as one, twelve buttocks slabbily resounding. Twelve as one, twelve as one. “I hear him, I hear him coming.” The music quickened; faster beat the feet, faster, faster fell the rhythmic hands. And all at once a great synthetic bass boomed out the words which announced the approaching atonement and final consummation of solidarity, the coming of the Twelve-in-One, the incarnation of the Greater Being. “Orgy-porgy,” it sang, while the tom-toms continued to beat their feverish tattoo:

“Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun,

Kiss the girls and make them One.

Boys at One with girls at peace;

Orgy-porgy gives release.”

“Orgy-porgy,” the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain, “Orgy-porgy, Ford and fun, kiss the girls…” And as they sang, the lights began slowly to fade—to fade and at the same time to grow warmer, richer, redder, until at last they were dancing in the crimson twilight of an Embryo Store. “Orgy-porgy…” In their blood-coloured and foetal darkness the dancers continued for a while to circulate, to beat and beat out the indefatigable rhythm. “Orgy-porgy…” Then the circle wavered, broke, fell in partial disintegration on the ring of couches which surrounded—circle enclosing circle—the table and its planetary chairs. “Orgy-porgy…” Tenderly the deep Voice crooned and cooed; in the red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering benevolently over the now prone or supine dancers.




They were standing on the roof; Big Henry had just sung eleven. The night was calm and warm.

“Wasn't it wonderful?” said Fifi Bradlaugh. “Wasn't it simply wonderful?” She looked at Bernard with an expression of rapture, but of rapture in which there was no trace of agitation or excitement—for to be excited is still to be unsatisfied. Hers was the calm ecstasy of achieved consummation, the peace, not of mere vacant satiety and nothingness, but of balanced life, of energies at rest and in equilibrium. A rich and living peace. For the Solidarity Service had given as well as taken, drawn off only to replenish. She was full, she was made perfect, she was still more than merely herself. “Didn't you think it was wonderful?” she insisted, looking into Bernard's face with those supernaturally shining eyes.

“Yes, I thought it was wonderful,” he lied and looked away; the sight of her transfigured face was at once an accusation and an ironical reminder of his own separateness. He was as miserably isolated now as he had been when the service began—more isolated by reason of his unreplenished emptiness, his dead satiety. Separate and unatoned, while the others were being fused into the Greater Being; alone even in Morgana's embrace—much more alone, indeed, more hopelessly himself than he had ever been in his life before. He had emerged from that crimson twilight into the common electric glare with a self-consciousness intensified to the pitch of agony. He was utterly miserable, and perhaps (her shining eyes accused him), perhaps it was his own fault. “Quite wonderful,” he repeated; but the only thing he could think of was Morgana's eyebrow.





Chapter Six


1


Odd, odd, odd, was Lenina's verdict on Bernard Marx. So odd, indeed, that in the course of the succeeding weeks she had wondered more than once whether she shouldn't change her mind about the New Mexico holiday, and go instead to the North Pole with Benito Hoover. The trouble was that she knew the North Pole, had been there with George Edzel only last summer, and what was more, found it pretty grim. Nothing to do, and the hotel too hopelessly old-fashioned—no television laid on in the bedrooms, no scent organ, only the most putrid synthetic music, and not more than twenty-five Escalator-Squash Courts for over two hundred guests. No, decidedly she couldn't face the North Pole again. Added to which, she had only been to America once before. And even then, how inadequately! A cheap week-end in New York—had it been with Jean-Jacques Habibullah or Bokanovsky Jones? She couldn't remember. Anyhow, it was of absolutely no importance. The prospect of flying West again, and for a whole week, was very inviting. Moreover, for at least three days of that week they would be in the Savage Reservation. Not more than half a dozen people in the whole Centre had ever been inside a Savage Reservation. As an Alpha-Plus psychologist, Bernard was one of the few men she knew entitled to a permit. For Lenina, the opportunity was unique. And yet, so unique also was Bernard's oddness that she had hesitated to take it, had actually thought of risking the Pole again with funny old Benito. At least Benito was normal. Whereas Bernard…

“Alcohol in his blood-surrogate,” was Fanny's explanation of every eccentricity. But Henry, with whom, one evening when they were in bed together, Lenina had rather anxiously discussed her new lover, Henry had compared poor Bernard to a rhinoceros.

“You can't teach a rhinoceros tricks,” he had explained in his brief and vigorous style. “Some men are almost rhinoceroses; they don't respond properly to conditioning. Poor devils! Bernard's one of them. Luckily for him, he's pretty good at his job. Otherwise the Director would never have kept him. However,” he added consolingly, “I think he's pretty harmless.”

Pretty harmless, perhaps; but also pretty disquieting. That mania, to start with, for doing things in private. Which meant, in practice, not doing anything at all. For what was there that one could do in private. (Apart, of course, from going to bed: but one couldn't do that all the time.) Yes, what was there? Precious little. The first afternoon they went out together was particularly fine. Lenina had suggested a swim at Toquay Country Club followed by dinner at the Oxford Union. But Bernard thought there would be too much of a crowd. Then what about a round of Electro-magnetic Golf at St. Andrew's? But again, no: Bernard considered that Electro-magnetic Golf was a waste of time.

“Then what's time for?” asked Lenina in some astonishment.

Apparently, for going walks in the Lake District; for that was what he now proposed. Land on the top of Skiddaw and walk for a couple of hours in the heather. “Alone with you, Lenina.”

“But, Bernard, we shall be alone all night.”

Bernard blushed and looked away. “I meant, alone for talking,” he mumbled.

“Talking? But what about?” Walking and talking—that seemed a very odd way of spending an afternoon.

In the end she persuaded him, much against his will, to fly over to Amsterdam to see the Semi-Demi-Finals of the Women's Heavyweight Wrestling Championship.

“In a crowd,” he grumbled. “As usual.” He remained obstinately gloomy the whole afternoon; wouldn't talk to Lenina's friends (of whom they met dozens in the ice-cream soma bar between the wrestling bouts); and in spite of his misery absolutely refused to take the half-gramme raspberry sundae which she pressed upon him. “I'd rather be myself,” he said. “Myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.”

“A gramme in time saves nine,” said Lenina, producing a bright treasure of sleep-taught wisdom.

Bernard pushed away the proffered glass impatiently.

“Now don't lose your temper,” she said. “Remember one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments.”

“Oh, for Ford's sake, be quiet!” he shouted.

Lenina shrugged her shoulders. “A gramme is always better than a damn,” she concluded with dignity, and drank the sundae herself.

On their way back across the Channel, Bernard insisted on stopping his propeller and hovering on his helicopter screws within a hundred feet of the waves. The weather had taken a change for the worse; a south-westerly wind had sprung up, the sky was cloudy.

“Look,” he commanded.

“But it's horrible,” said Lenina, shrinking back from the window. She was appalled by the rushing emptiness of the night, by the black foam-flecked water heaving beneath them, by the pale face of the moon, so haggard and distracted among the hastening clouds. “Let's turn on the radio. Quick!” She reached for the dialling knob on the dash-board and turned it at random.

“…skies are blue inside of you,” sang sixteen tremoloing falsettos, “the weather's always…”

Then a hiccough and silence. Bernard had switched off the current.

“I want to look at the sea in peace,” he said. “One can't even look with that beastly noise going on.”

“But it's lovely. And I don't want to look.”

“But I do,” he insisted. “It makes me feel as though…” he hesitated, searching for words with which to express himself, “as though I were more me, if you see what I mean. More on my own, not so completely a part of something else. Not just a cell in the social body. Doesn't it make you feel like that, Lenina?”

But Lenina was crying. “It's horrible, it's horrible,” she kept repeating. “And how can you talk like that about not wanting to be a part of the social body? After all, every one works for every one else. We can't do without any one. Even Epsilons…”

“Yes, I know,” said Bernard derisively. “‘Even Epsilons are useful’! So am I. And I damned well wish I weren't!”

Lenina was shocked by his blasphemy. “Bernard!” She protested in a voice of amazed distress. “How can you?”

In a different key, “How can I?” he repeated meditatively. “No, the real problem is: How is it that I can't, or rather—because, after all, I know quite well why I can't—what would it be like if I could, if I were free—not enslaved by my conditioning.”

“But, Bernard, you're saying the most awful things.”

“Don't you wish you were free, Lenina?”

“I don't know what you mean. I am free. Free to have the most wonderful time. Everybody's happy nowadays.”

He laughed, “Yes, ‘Everybody's happy nowadays.’ We begin giving the children that at five. But wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, Lenina? In your own way, for example; not in everybody else's way.”

“I don't know what you mean,” she repeated. Then, turning to him, “Oh, do let's go back, Bernard,” she besought; “I do so hate it here.”

“Don't you like being with me?”

“But of course, Bernard. It's this horrible place.”

“I thought we'd be more…more together here—with nothing but the sea and moon. More together than in that crowd, or even in my rooms. Don't you understand that?”

“I don't understand anything,” she said with decision, determined to preserve her incomprehension intact. “Nothing. Least of all,” she continued in another tone, “why you don't take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours. You'd forget all about them. And instead of feeling miserable, you'd be jolly. So jolly,” she repeated and smiled, for all the puzzled anxiety in her eyes, with what was meant to be an inviting and voluptuous cajolery.

He looked at her in silence, his face unresponsive and very grave—looked at her intently. After a few seconds Lenina's eyes flinched away; she uttered a nervous little laugh, tried to think of something to say and couldn't. The silence prolonged itself.

When Bernard spoke at last, it was in a small tired voice. “All right then,” he said, “we'll go back.” And stepping hard on the accelerator, he sent the machine rocketing up into the sky. At four thousand he started his propeller. They flew in silence for a minute or two. Then, suddenly, Bernard began to laugh. Rather oddly, Lenina thought; but still, it was laughter.

“Feeling better?” she ventured to ask.

For answer, he lifted one hand from the controls and, slipping his arm around her, began to fondle her breasts.

“Thank Ford,” she said to herself, “he's all right again.”

Half an hour later they were back in his rooms. Bernard swallowed four tablets of soma at a gulp, turned on the radio and television and began to undress.

“Well,” Lenina enquired, with significant archness when they met next afternoon on the roof, “did you think it was fun yesterday?”

Bernard nodded. They climbed into the plane. A little jolt, and they were off.

“Every one says I'm awfully pneumatic,” said Lenina reflectively, patting her own legs.

“Awfully.” But there was an expression of pain in Bernard's eyes. “Like meat,” he was thinking.

She looked up with a certain anxiety. “But you don't think I'm too plump, do you?”

He shook his head. Like so much meat.

“You think I'm all right.” Another nod. “In every way?”

“Perfect,” he said aloud. And inwardly. “She thinks of herself that way. She doesn't mind being meat.”

Lenina smiled triumphantly. But her satisfaction was premature.

“All the same,” he went on, after a little pause, “I still rather wish it had all ended differently.”

“Differently?” Were there other endings?

“I didn't want it to end with our going to bed,” he specified.

Lenina was astonished.

“Not at once, not the first day.”

“But then what…?”

He began to talk a lot of incomprehensible and dangerous nonsense. Lenina did her best to stop the ears of her mind; but every now and then a phrase would insist on becoming audible. “…to try the effect of arresting my impulses,” she heard him say. The words seemed to touch a spring in her mind.

“Never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have to-day,” she said gravely.

“Two hundred repetitions, twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a half,” was all his comment. The mad bad talk rambled on. “I want to know what passion is,” she heard him saying. “I want to feel something strongly.”

“When the individual feels, the community reels,” Lenina pronounced.

“Well, why shouldn't it reel a bit?”

“Bernard!”

But Bernard remained unabashed.

“Adults intellectually and during working hours,” he went on. “Infants where feeling and desire are concerned.”

“Our Ford loved infants.”

Ignoring the interruption. “It suddenly struck me the other day,” continued Bernard, “that it might be possible to be an adult all the time.”

“I don't understand.” Lenina's tone was firm.

“I know you don't. And that's why we went to bed together yesterday—like infants—instead of being adults and waiting.”

“But it was fun,” Lenina insisted. “Wasn't it?”

“Oh, the greatest fun,” he answered, but in a voice so mournful, with an expression so profoundly miserable, that Lenina felt all her triumph suddenly evaporate. Perhaps he had found her too plump, after all.

“I told you so,” was all that Fanny said, when Lenina came and made her confidences. “It's the alcohol they put in his surrogate.”

“All the same,” Lenina insisted. “I do like him. He has such awfully nice hands. And the way he moves his shoulders—that's very attractive.” She sighed. “But I wish he weren't so odd.”

Halting for a moment outside the door of the Director's room, Bernard drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders, bracing himself to meet the dislike and disapproval which he was certain of finding within. He knocked and entered.

“A permit for you to initial, Director,” he said as airily as possible, and laid the paper on the writing-table.

The Director glanced at him sourly. But the stamp of the World Controller's Office was at the head of the paper and the signature of Mustapha Mond, bold and black, across the bottom. Everything was perfectly in order. The director had no choice. He pencilled his initials—two small pale letters abject at the feet of Mustapha Mond—and was about to return the paper without a word of comment or genial Ford-speed, when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the permit.

“For the New Mexican Reservation?” he said, and his tone, the face he lifted to Bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment.

Surprised by his surprise, Bernard nodded. There was a silence.

The Director leaned back in his chair, frowning. “How long ago was it?” he said, speaking more to himself than to Bernard. “Twenty years, I suppose. Nearer twenty-five. I must have been your age…” He sighed and shook his head.

Bernard felt extremely uncomfortable. A man so conventional, so scrupulously correct as the Director—and to commit so gross a solecism! It made him want to hide his face, to run out of the room. Not that he himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote past; that was one of those hypnopaedic prejudices he had (so he imagined) completely got rid of. What made him feel shy was the knowledge that the Director disapproved—disapproved and yet had been betrayed into doing the forbidden thing. Under what inward compulsion? Through his discomfort Bernard eagerly listened.

“I had the same idea as you,” the Director was saying. “Wanted to have a look at the savages. Got a permit for New Mexico and went there for my summer holiday. With the girl I was having at the moment. She was a Beta-Minus, and I think” (he shut his eyes), “I think she had yellow hair. Anyhow she was pneumatic, particularly pneumatic; I remember that. Well, we went there, and we looked at the savages, and we rode about on horses and all that. And then—it was almost the last day of my leave—then…well, she got lost. We'd gone riding up one of those revolting mountains, and it was horribly hot and oppressive, and after lunch we went to sleep. Or at least I did. She must have gone for a walk, alone. At any rate, when I woke up, she wasn't there. And the most frightful thunderstorm I've ever seen was just bursting on us. And it poured and roared and flashed; and the horses broke loose and ran away; and I fell down, trying to catch them, and hurt my knee, so that I could hardly walk. Still, I searched and I shouted and I searched. But there was no sign of her. Then I thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. So I crawled down into the valley by the way we had come. My knee was agonizingly painful, and I'd lost my soma. It took me hours. I didn't get back to the rest-house till after midnight. And she wasn't there; she wasn't there,” the Director repeated. There was a silence. “Well,” he resumed at last, “the next day there was a search. But we couldn't find her. She must have fallen into a gully somewhere; or been eaten by a mountain lion. Ford knows. Anyhow it was horrible. It upset me very much at the time. More than it ought to have done, I dare say. Because, after all, it's the sort of accident that might have happened to any one; and, of course, the social body persists although the component cells may change.” But this sleep-taught consolation did not seem to be very effective. Shaking his head, “I actually dream about it sometimes,” the Director went on in a low voice. “Dream of being woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone; dream of searching and searching for her under the trees.” He lapsed into the silence of reminiscence.

“You must have had a terrible shock,” said Bernard, almost enviously.

At the sound of his voice the Director started into a guilty realization of where he was; shot a glance at Bernard, and averting his eyes, blushed darkly; looked at him again with sudden suspicion and, angrily on his dignity, “Don't imagine,” he said, “that I'd had any indecorous relation with the girl. Nothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. It was all perfectly healthy and normal.” He handed Bernard the permit. “I really don't know why I bored you with this trivial anecdote.” Furious with himself for having given away a discreditable secret, he vented his rage on Bernard. The look in his eyes was now frankly malignant. “And I should like to take this opportunity, Mr. Marx,” he went on, “of saying that I'm not at all pleased with the reports I receive of your behaviour outside working hours. You may say that this is not my business. But it is. I have the good name of the Centre to think of. My workers must be above suspicion, particularly those of the highest castes. Alphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional behaviour. But that is all the more reason for their making a special effort to conform. It is their duty to be infantile, even against their inclination. And so, Mr. Marx, I give you fair warning.” The Director's voice vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous and impersonal—was the expression of the disapproval of Society itself. “If ever I hear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile decorum, I shall ask for your transference to a Sub-Centre—preferably to Iceland. Good-morning.” And swivelling round in his chair, he picked up his pen and began to write.

“That'll teach him,” he said to himself. But he was mistaken. For Bernard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance. Even the thought of persecution left him undismayed, was rather tonic than depressing. He felt strong enough to meet and overcome affliction, strong enough to face even Iceland. And this confidence was the greater for his not for a moment really believing that he would be called upon to face anything at all. People simply weren't transferred for things like that. Iceland was just a threat. A most stimulating and life-giving threat. Walking along the corridor, he actually whistled.

Heroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the D.H.C. “Whereupon,” it concluded, “I simply told him to go to the Bottomless Past and marched out of the room. And that was that.” He looked at Helmholtz Watson expectantly, awaiting his due reward of sympathy, encouragement, admiration. But no word came. Helmholtz sat silent, staring at the floor.

He liked Bernard; he was grateful to him for being the only man of his acquaintance with whom he could talk about the subjects he felt to be important. Nevertheless, there were things in Bernard which he hated. This boasting, for example. And the outbursts of an abject self-pity with which it alternated. And his deplorable habit of being bold after the event, and full, in absence, of the most extraordinary presence of mind. He hated these things—just because he liked Bernard. The seconds passed. Helmholtz continued to stare at the floor. And suddenly Bernard blushed and turned away.

The journey was quite uneventful. The Blue Pacific Rocket was two and a half minutes early at New Orleans, lost four minutes in a tornado over Texas, but flew into a favourable air current at Longitude 95 West, and was able to land at Santa Fé less than forty seconds behind schedule time.

“Forty seconds on a six and a half hour flight. Not so bad,” Lenina conceded.

They slept that night at Santa Fé. The hotel was excellent—incomparably better, for example, than that horrible Aurora Bora Palace in which Lenina had suffered so much the previous summer. Liquid air, television, vibro-vacuum massage, radio, boiling caffeine solution, hot contraceptives, and eight different kinds of scent were laid on in every bedroom. The synthetic music plant was working as they entered the hall and left nothing to be desired. A notice in the lift announced that there were sixty Escalator-Squash-Racquet Courts in the hotel, and that Obstacle and Electro-magnetic Golf could both be played in the park.

“But it sounds simply too lovely,” cried Lenina. “I almost wish we could stay here. Sixty Escalator-Squash Courts…”

“There won't be any in the Reservation,” Bernard warned her. “And no scent, no television, no hot water even. If you feel you can't stand it, stay here till I come back.”

Lenina was quite offended. “Of course I can stand it. I only said it was lovely here because…well, because progress is lovely, isn't it?”

“Five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,” said Bernard wearily, as though to himself.

“What did you say?”

“I said that progress was lovely. That's why you mustn't come to the Reservation unless you really want to.”

“But I do want to.”

“Very well, then,” said Bernard; and it was almost a threat.

Their permit required the signature of the Warden of the Reservation, at whose office next morning they duly presented themselves. An Epsilon-Plus negro porter took in Bernard's card, and they were admitted almost immediately.

The Warden was a blond and brachycephalic Alpha-Minus, short, red, moon-faced, and broad-shouldered, with a loud booming voice, very well adapted to the utterance of hypnopaedic wisdom. He was a mine of irrelevant information and unasked-for good advice. Once started, he went on and on—boomingly.

“…five hundred and sixty thousand square kilometres, divided into four distinct Sub-Reservations, each surrounded by a high-tension wire fence.”

At this moment, and for no apparent reason, Bernard suddenly remembered that he had left the eau-de-Cologne tap in his bathroom wide open and running.

“…supplied with current from the Grand Canyon hydro-electric station.”

“Cost me a fortune by the time I get back.” With his mind's eye, Bernard saw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round, ant-like, indefatigable. “Quickly telephone to Helmholtz Watson.”

“…upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand volts.”

“You don't say so,” said Lenina politely, not knowing in the least what the Warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. When the Warden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed half a gramme of soma, with the result that she could now sit, serenely not listening, thinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue eyes fixed on the Warden's face in an expression of rapt attention.

“To touch the fence is instant death,” pronounced the Warden solemnly. “There is no escape from a Savage Reservation.”

The word “escape” was suggestive. “Perhaps,” said Bernard, half rising, “we ought to think of going.” The little black needle was scurrying, an insect, nibbling through time, eating into his money.

“No escape,” repeated the Warden, waving him back into his chair; and as the permit was not yet countersigned Bernard had no choice but to obey. “Those who are born in the Reservation—and remember, my dear young lady,” he added, leering obscenely at Lenina, and speaking in an improper whisper, “remember that, in the Reservation, children still are born, yes, actually born, revolting as that may seem…” (He hoped that this reference to a shameful subject would make Lenina blush; but she only smiled with simulated intelligence and said, “You don't say so!” Disappointed, the Warden began again. ) “Those, I repeat who are born in the Reservation are destined to die there.”

Destined to die…A decilitre of eau-de-Cologne every minute. Six litres an hour. “Perhaps,” Bernard tried again, “we ought…”

Leaning forward, the Warden tapped the table with his forefinger. “You ask me how many people live in the Reservation. And I reply”—triumphantly—“reply that we do not know. We can only guess.”

“You don't say so.”

“My dear young lady, I do say so.”

Six times twenty-four—no, it would be nearer six times thirty-six. Bernard was pale and trembling with impatience. But inexorably the booming continued.

“…about sixty thousand Indians and half-breeds…absolute savages…our inspectors occasionally visit…otherwise, no communication whatever with the civilized world…still preserve their repulsive habits and customs…marriage, if you know what that is, my dear young lady; families…no conditioning…monstrous superstitions…Christianity and totemism and ancestor worship…extinct languages, such as Zuñi and Spanish and Athapascan…pumas, porcupines and other ferocious animals…infectious diseases…priests…venomous lizards…”

“You don't say so?”

They got away at last. Bernard dashed to the telephone. Quick, quick; but it took him nearly three minutes to get on to Helmholtz Watson. “We might be among the savages already,” he complained. “Damned incompetence!”

“Have a gramme,” suggested Lenina.

He refused, preferring his anger. And at last, thank Ford, he was through and, yes, it was Helmholtz; Helmholtz, to whom he explained what had happened, and who promised to go round at once, at once, and turn off the tap, yes, at once, but took this opportunity to tell him what the D.H.C. had said, in public, yesterday evening…

“What? He's looking out for some one to take my place?” Bernard's voice was agonized. “So it's actually decided? Did he mention Iceland? You say he did? Ford! Iceland…” He hung up the receiver and turned back to Lenina. His face was pale, his expression utterly dejected.

“What's the matter?” she asked.

“The matter?” He dropped heavily into a chair. “I'm going to be sent to Iceland.”

Often in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be subjected (soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to rely on) to some great trial, some pain, some persecution; he had even longed for affliction. As recently as a week ago, in the Director's office, he had imagined himself courageously resisting, stoically accepting suffering without a word. The Director's threats had actually elated him, made him feel larger than life. But that, as he now realized, was because he had not taken the threats quite seriously, he had not believed that, when it came to the point, the D.H.C. would ever do anything. Now that it looked as though the threats were really to be fulfilled, Bernard was appalled. Of that imagined stoicism, that theoretical courage, not a trace was left.

He raged against himself—what a fool!—against the Director—how unfair not to give him that other chance, that other chance which, he now had no doubt at all, he had always intended to take. And Iceland, Iceland…

Lenina shook her head. “Was and will make me ill,” she quoted, “I take a gramme and only am.”

In the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. Five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present rosily blossomed. A message from the porter announced that, at the Warden's orders, a Reservation Guard had come round with a plane and was waiting on the roof of the hotel. They went up at once. An octoroon in Gamma-green uniform saluted and proceeded to recite the morning's programme.

A bird's-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos, then a landing for lunch in the valley of Malpais. The rest-house was comfortable there, and up at the pueblo the savages would probably be celebrating their summer festival. It would be the best place to spend the night.

They took their seats in the plane and set off. Ten minutes later they were crossing the frontier that separated civilization from savagery. Uphill and down, across the deserts of salt or sand, through forests, into the violet depth of canyons, over crag and peak and table-topped mesa, the fence marched on and on, irresistibly the straight line, the geometrical symbol of triumphant human purpose. And at its foot, here and there, a mosaic of white bones, a still unrotted carcase dark on the tawny ground marked the place where deer or steer, puma or porcupine or coyote, or the greedy turkey buzzards drawn down by the whiff of carrion and fulminated as though by a poetic justice, had come too close to the destroying wires.

“They never learn,” said the green-uniformed pilot, pointing down at the skeletons on the ground below them. “And they never will learn,” he added and laughed, as though he had somehow scored a personal triumph over the electrocuted animals.

Bernard also laughed; after two grammes of soma the joke seemed, for some reason, good. Laughed and then, almost immediately, dropped off to sleep and, sleeping was carried over Taos and Tesuque; over Nambe and Picuris and Pojoaque, over Sia and Cochiti, over Laguna and Acoma and the Enchanted Mesa, over Zuñi and Cibola and Ojo Caliente, and woke at last to find the machine standing on the ground, Lenina carrying the suitcases into a small square house, and the Gamma-green octoroon talking incomprehensibly with a young Indian.

“Malpais,” explained the pilot, as Bernard stepped out. “This is the rest-house. And there's a dance this afternoon at the pueblo. He'll take you there.” He pointed to the sullen young savage. “Funny, I expect.” He grinned. “Everything they do is funny.” And with that he climbed into the plane and started up the engines. “Back to-morrow. And remember,” he added reassuringly to Lenina, “they're perfectly tame; savages won't do you any harm. They've got enough experience of gas bombs to know that they mustn't play any tricks.” Still laughing, he threw the helicopter screws into gear, accelerated, and was gone.





Chapter Seven


The mesa was like a ship becalmed in a strait of lion-coloured dust. The channel wound between precipitous banks, and slanting from one wall to the other across the valley ran a streak of green—the river and its fields. On the prow of that stone ship in the centre of the strait, and seemingly a part of it, a shaped and geometrical outcrop of the naked rock, stood the pueblo of Malpais. Block above block, each story smaller than the one below, the tall houses rose like stepped and amputated pyramids into the blue sky. At their feet lay a straggle of low buildings, a criss-cross of walls; and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into the plain. A few columns of smoke mounted perpendicularly into the windless air and were lost.

“Queer,” said Lenina. “Very queer.” It was her ordinary word of condemnation. “I don't like it. And I don't like that man.” She pointed to the Indian guide who had been appointed to take them up to the pueblo. Her feeling was evidently reciprocated; the very back of the man, as he walked along before them, was hostile, sullenly contemptuous.

“Besides,” she lowered her voice, “he smells.”

Bernard did not attempt to deny it. They walked on.

Suddenly it was as though the whole air had come alive and were pulsing, pulsing with the indefatigable movement of blood. Up there, in Malpais, the drums were being beaten. Their feet fell in with the rhythm of that mysterious heart; they quickened their pace. Their path led them to the foot of the precipice. The sides of the great mesa ship towered over them, three hundred feet to the gunwale.

“I wish we could have brought the plane,” said Lenina, looking up resentfully at the blank impending rock-face. “I hate walking. And you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.”

They walked along for some way in the shadow of the mesa, rounded a projection, and there, in a water-worn ravine, was the way up the companion ladder. They climbed. It was a very steep path that zigzagged from side to side of the gully. Sometimes the pulsing of the drums was all but inaudible, at others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner.

When they were half-way up, an eagle flew past so close to them that the wind of his wings blew chill on their faces. In a crevice of the rock lay a pile of bones. It was all oppressively queer, and the Indian smelt stronger and stronger. They emerged at last from the ravine into the full sunlight. The top of the mesa was a flat deck of stone.

“Like the Charing-T Tower,” was Lenina's comment. But she was not allowed to enjoy her discovery of this reassuring resemblance for long. A padding of soft feet made them turn round. Naked from throat to navel, their dark-brown bodies painted with white lines (“like asphalt tennis courts,” Lenina was later to explain), their faces inhuman with daubings of scarlet, black and ochre, two Indians came running along the path. Their black hair was braided with fox fur and red flannel. Cloaks of turkey feathers fluttered from their shoulders; huge feather diadems exploded gaudily round their heads. With every step they took came the clink and rattle of their silver bracelets, their heavy necklaces of bone and turquoise beads. They came on without a word, running quietly in their deerskin moccasins. One of them was holding a feather brush; the other carried, in either hand, what looked at a distance like three or four pieces of thick rope. One of the ropes writhed uneasily, and suddenly Lenina saw that they were snakes.

The men came nearer and nearer; their dark eyes looked at her, but without giving any sign of recognition, any smallest sign that they had seen her or were aware of her existence. The writhing snake hung limp again with the rest. The men passed.

“I don't like it,” said Lenina. “I don't like it.”

She liked even less what awaited her at the entrance to the pueblo, where their guide had left them while he went inside for instructions. The dirt, to start with, the piles of rubbish, the dust, the dogs, the flies. Her face wrinkled up into a grimace of disgust. She held her handkerchief to her nose.

“But how can they live like this?” she broke out in a voice of indignant incredulity. (It wasn't possible.)

Bernard shrugged his shoulders philosophically. “Anyhow,” he said, “they've been doing it for the last five or six thousand years. So I suppose they must be used to it by now.”

“But cleanliness is next to fordliness,” she insisted.

“Yes, and civilization is sterilization,” Bernard went on, concluding on a tone of irony the second hypnopaedic lesson in elementary hygiene. “But these people have never heard of Our Ford, and they aren't civilized. So there's no point in…”

“Oh!” She gripped his arm. “Look.”

An almost naked Indian was very slowly climbing down the ladder from the first-floor terrace of a neighbouring house—rung after rung, with the tremulous caution of extreme old age. His face was profoundly wrinkled and black, like a mask of obsidian. The toothless mouth had fallen in. At the corners of the lips, and on each side of the chin, a few long bristles gleamed almost white against the dark skin. The long unbraided hair hung down in grey wisps round his face. His body was bent and emaciated to the bone, almost fleshless. Very slowly he came down, pausing at each rung before he ventured another step.

“What's the matter with him?” whispered Lenina. Her eyes were wide with horror and amazement.

“He's old, that's all,” Bernard answered as carelessly as he could. He too was startled; but he made an effort to seem unmoved.

“Old?” she repeated. “But the Director's old; lots of people are old; they're not like that.”

“That's because we don't allow them to be like that. We preserve them from diseases. We keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at a youthful equilibrium. We don't permit their magnesium-calcium ratio to fall below what it was at thirty. We give them transfusion of young blood. We keep their metabolism permanently stimulated. So, of course, they don't look like that. Partly,” he added, “because most of them die long before they reach this old creature's age. Youth almost unimpaired till sixty, and then, crack! the end.”

But Lenina was not listening. She was watching the old man. Slowly, slowly he came down. His feet touched the ground. He turned. In their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. They looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been there at all. Then slowly, with bent back the old man hobbled past them and was gone.

“But it's terrible,” Lenina whispered. “It's awful. We ought not to have come here.” She felt in her pocket for her soma—only to discover that, by some unprecedented oversight, she had left the bottle down at the rest-house. Bernard's pockets were also empty.

Lenina was left to face the horrors of Malpais unaided. They came crowding in on her thick and fast. The spectacle of two young women giving breast to their babies made her blush and turn away her face. She had never seen anything so indecent in her life. And what made it worse was that, instead of tactfully ignoring it, Bernard proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene. Ashamed, now that the effects of the soma had worn off, of the weakness he had displayed that morning in the hotel, he went out of his way to show himself strong and unorthodox.

“What a wonderfully intimate relationship,” he said, deliberately outrageous. “And what an intensity of feeling it must generate! I often think one may have missed something in not having had a mother. And perhaps you've missed something in not being a mother, Lenina. Imagine yourself sitting there with a little baby of your own….”

“Bernard! How can you?” The passage of an old woman with ophthalmia and a disease of the skin distracted her from her indignation.

“Let's go away,” she begged. “I don't like it.”

But at this moment their guide came back and, beckoning them to follow, led the way down the narrow street between the houses. They rounded a corner. A dead dog was lying on a rubbish heap; a woman with a goitre was looking for lice in the hair of a small girl. Their guide halted at the foot of a ladder, raised his hand perpendicularly, then darted it horizontally forward. They did what he mutely commanded—climbed the ladder and walked through the doorway, to which it gave access, into a long narrow room, rather dark and smelling of smoke and cooked grease and long-worn, long-unwashed clothes. At the further end of the room was another doorway, through which came a shaft of sunlight and the noise, very loud and close, of the drums.

They stepped across the threshold and found themselves on a wide terrace. Below them, shut in by the tall houses, was the village square, crowded with Indians. Bright blankets, and feathers in black hair, and the glint of turquoise, and dark skins shining with heat. Lenina put her handkerchief to her nose again. In the open space at the centre of the square were two circular platforms of masonry and trampled clay—the roofs, it was evident, of underground chambers; for in the centre of each platform was an open hatchway, with a ladder emerging from the lower darkness. A sound of subterranean flute-playing came up and was almost lost in the steady remorseless persistence of the drums.

Lenina liked the drums. Shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their soft repeated thunder, allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more completely, till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep pulse of sound. It reminded her reassuringly of the synthetic noises made at Solidarity Services and Ford's Day celebrations. “Orgy-porgy,” she whispered to herself. These drums beat out just the same rhythms.

There was a sudden startling burst of singing—hundreds of male voices crying out fiercely in harsh metallic unison. A few long notes and silence, the thunderous silence of the drums; then shrill, in a neighing treble, the women's answer. Then again the drums; and once more the men's deep savage affirmation of their manhood.

Queer—yes. The place was queer, so was the music, so were the clothes and the goitres and the skin diseases and the old people. But the performance itself—there seemed to be nothing specially queer about that.

“It reminds me of a lower-caste Community Sing,” she told Bernard.

But a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocuous function. For suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers underground a ghastly troop of monsters. Hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square; round and again round, singing as they went, round and round—each time a little faster; and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm, so that it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears; and the crowd had begun to sing with the dancers, louder and louder; and first one woman had shrieked, and then another and another, as though they were being killed; and then suddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line, ran to a big wooden chest which was standing at one end of the square, raised the lid and pulled out a pair of black snakes. A great yell went up from the crowd, and all the other dancers ran towards him with outstretched hands. He tossed the snakes to the first-comers, then dipped back into the chest for more. More and more, black snakes and brown and mottled—he flung them out. And then the dance began again on a different rhythm. Round and round they went with their snakes, snakily, with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. Round and round. Then the leader gave a signal, and one after another, all the snakes were flung down in the middle of the square; an old man came up from underground and sprinkled them with corn meal, and from the other hatchway came a woman and sprinkled them with water from a black jar. Then the old man lifted his hand and, startlingly, terrifyingly, there was absolute silence. The drums stopped beating, life seemed to have come to an end. The old man pointed towards the two hatchways that gave entrance to the lower world. And slowly, raised by invisible hands from below, there emerged from the one a painted image of an eagle, from the other that of a man, naked, and nailed to a cross. They hung there, seemingly self-sustained, as though watching. The old man clapped his hands. Naked but for a white cotton breech-cloth, a boy of about eighteen stepped out of the crowd and stood before him, his hands crossed over his chest, his head bowed. The old man made the sign of the cross over him and turned away. Slowly, the boy began to walk round the writhing heap of snakes. He had completed the first circuit and was half-way through the second when, from among the dancers, a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and holding in his hand a whip of plaited leather advanced towards him. The boy moved on as though unaware of the other's existence. The coyote-man raised his whip; there was a long moment of expectancy, then a swift movement, the whistle of the lash and its loud flat sounding impact on the flesh. The boy's body quivered; but he made no sound, he walked on at the same slow, steady pace. The coyote struck again, again; and at every blow at first a gasp, and then a deep groan went up from the crowd. The boy walked. Twice, thrice, four times round he went. The blood was streaming. Five times round, six times round. Suddenly Lenina covered her face with her hands and began to sob. “Oh, stop them, stop them!” she implored. But the whip fell and fell inexorably. Seven times round. Then all at once the boy staggered and, still without a sound, pitched forward on to his face. Bending over him, the old man touched his back with a long white feather, held it up for a moment, crimson, for the people to see then shook it thrice over the snakes. A few drops fell, and suddenly the drums broke out again into a panic of hurrying notes; there was a great shout. The dancers rushed forward, picked up the snakes and ran out of the square. Men, women, children, all the crowd ran after them. A minute later the square was empty, only the boy remained, prone where he had fallen, quite still. Three old women came out of one of the houses, and with some difficulty lifted him and carried him in. The eagle and the man on the cross kept guard for a little while over the empty pueblo; then, as though they had seen enough, sank slowly down through their hatchways, out of sight, into the nether world.

Lenina was still sobbing. “Too awful,” she kept repeating, and all Bernard's consolations were in vain. “Too awful! That blood!” She shuddered. “Oh, I wish I had my soma.”

There was the sound of feet in the inner room.

Lenina did not move, but sat with her face in her hands, unseeing, apart. Only Bernard turned round.

The dress of the young man who now stepped out on to the terrace was Indian; but his plaited hair was straw-coloured, his eyes a pale blue, and his skin a white skin, bronzed.

“Hullo. Good-morrow,” said the stranger, in faultless but peculiar English. “You're civilized, aren't you? You come from the Other Place, outside the Reservation?”

“Who on earth…?” Bernard began in astonishment.

The young man sighed and shook his head. “A most unhappy gentleman.” And, pointing to the bloodstains in the centre of the square, “Do you see that damned spot?” he asked in a voice that trembled with emotion.

“A gramme is better than a damn,” said Lenina mechanically from behind her hands. “I wish I had my soma!”

“I ought to have been there,” the young man went on. “Why wouldn't they let me be the sacrifice? I'd have gone round ten times—twelve, fifteen. Palowhtiwa only got as far as seven. They could have had twice as much blood from me. The multitudinous seas incarnadine.” He flung out his arms in a lavish gesture; then, despairingly, let them fall again. “But they wouldn't let me. They disliked me for my complexion. It's always been like that. Always.” Tears stood in the young man's eyes; he was ashamed and turned away.

Astonishment made Lenina forget the deprivation of soma. She uncovered her face and, for the first time, looked at the stranger. “Do you mean to say that you wanted to be hit with that whip?”

Still averted from her, the young man made a sign of affirmation. “For the sake of the pueblo—to make the rain come and the corn grow. And to please Pookong and Jesus. And then to show that I can bear pain without crying out. Yes,” and his voice suddenly took on a new resonance, he turned with a proud squaring of the shoulders, a proud, defiant lifting of the chin, “to show that I'm a man…Oh!” He gave a gasp and was silent, gaping. He had seen, for the first time in his life, the face of a girl whose cheeks were not the colour of chocolate or dogskin, whose hair was auburn and permanently waved, and whose expression (amazing novelty!) was one of benevolent interest. Lenina was smiling at him; such a nice-looking boy, she was thinking, and a really beautiful body. The blood rushed up into the young man's face; he dropped his eyes, raised them again for a moment only to find her still smiling at him, and was so much overcome that he had to turn away and pretend to be looking very hard at something on the other side of the square.

Bernard's questions made a diversion. Who? How? When? From where? Keeping his eyes fixed on Bernard's face (for so passionately did he long to see Lenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her), the young man tried to explain himself. Linda and he—Linda was his mother (the word made Lenina look uncomfortable)—were strangers in the Reservation. Linda had come from the Other Place long ago, before he was born, with a man who was his father. (Bernard pricked up his ears.) She had gone walking alone in those mountains over there to the North, had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. (“Go on, go on,” said Bernard excitedly.) Some hunters from Malpais had found her and brought her to the pueblo. As for the man who was his father, Linda had never seen him again. His name was Tomakin. (Yes, “Thomas” was the D.H.C.'s first name.) He must have flown away, back to the Other Place, away without her—a bad, unkind, unnatural man.

“And so I was born in Malpais,” he concluded. “In Malpais.” And he shook his head.




The squalor of that little house on the outskirts of the pueblo!

A space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. Two famine-stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. Inside, when they entered, the twilight stank and was loud with flies.

“Linda!” the young man called.

From the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said, “Coming.”

They waited. In bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal, perhaps of several meals.

The door opened. A very stout blonde squaw stepped across the threshold and stood looking at the strangers staring incredulously, her mouth open. Lenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth were missing. And the colour of the ones that remained…She shuddered. It was worse than the old man. So fat. And all the lines in her face, the flabbiness, the wrinkles. And the sagging cheeks, with those purplish blotches. And the red veins on her nose, the bloodshot eyes. And that neck—that neck; and the blanket she wore over her head—ragged and filthy. And under the brown sack-shaped tunic those enormous breasts, the bulge of the stomach, the hips. Oh, much worse than the old man, much worse! And suddenly the creature burst out in a torrent of speech, rushed at her with outstretched arms and—Ford! Ford! it was too revolting, in another moment she'd be sick—pressed her against the bulge, the bosom, and began to kiss her. Ford! to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt too horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into Delta and Epsilon bottles (no, it wasn't true about Bernard), positively stank of alcohol. She broke away as quickly as she could.

A blubbered and distorted face confronted her; the creature was crying.

“Oh, my dear, my dear.” The torrent of words flowed sobbingly. “If you knew how glad—after all these years! A civilized face. Yes, and civilized clothes. Because I thought I should never see a piece of real acetate silk again.” She fingered the sleeve of Lenina's shirt. The nails were black. “And those adorable viscose velveteen shorts! Do you know, dear, I've still got my old clothes, the ones I came in, put away in a box. I'll show them you afterwards. Though, of course, the acetate has all gone into holes. But such a lovely white bandolier—though I must say your green morocco is even lovelier. Not that it did me much good, that bandolier.” Her tears began to flow again. “I suppose John told you. What I had to suffer—and not a gramme of soma to be had. Only a drink of mescal every now and then, when Popé used to bring it. Popé is a boy I used to know. But it makes you feel so bad afterwards, the mescal does, and you're sick with the peyotl; besides, it always made that awful feeling of being ashamed much worse the next day. And I was so ashamed. Just think of it: me, a Beta—having a baby: put yourself in my place.” (The mere suggestion made Lenina shudder.) “Though it wasn't my fault, I swear; because I still don't know how it happened, seeing that I did all the Malthusian Drill—you know, by numbers, One, two, three, four, always, I swear it; but all the same it happened, and of course there wasn't anything like an Abortion Centre here. Is it still down in Chelsea, by the way?” she asked. Lenina nodded. “And still flood-lighted on Tuesdays and Fridays?” Lenina nodded again. “That lovely pink glass tower!” Poor Linda lifted her face and with closed eyes ecstatically contemplated the bright remembered image. “And the river at night,” she whispered. Great tears oozed slowly out from behind her tight-shut eyelids. “And flying back in the evening from Stoke Poges. And then a hot bath and vibro-vacuum massage…But there.” She drew a deep breath, shook her head, opened her eyes again, sniffed once or twice, then blew her nose on her fingers and wiped them on the skirt of her tunic. “Oh, I'm so sorry,” she said in response to Lenina's involuntary grimace of disgust. “I oughtn't to have done that. I'm sorry. But what are you to do when there aren't any handkerchiefs? I remember how it used to upset me, all that dirt, and nothing being aseptic. I had an awful cut on my head when they first brought me here. You can't imagine what they used to put on it. Filth, just filth. ‘Civilization is Sterilization,’ I used to say t them. And ‘Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T, to see a fine bathroom and W.C’ as though they were children. But of course they didn't understand. How should they? And in the end I suppose I got used to it. And anyhow, how can you keep things clean when there isn't hot water laid on? And look at these clothes. This beastly wool isn't like acetate. It lasts and lasts. And you're supposed to mend it if it gets torn. But I'm a Beta; I worked in the Fertilizing Room; nobody ever taught me to do anything like that. It wasn't my business. Besides, it never used to be right to mend clothes. Throw them away when they've got holes in them and buy new. ‘The more stitches, the less riches.’ Isn't that right? Mending's anti-social. But it's all different here. It's like living with lunatics. Everything they do is mad.” She looked round; saw John and Bernard had left them and were walking up and down in the dust and garbage outside the house; but, none the less confidentially lowering her voice, and leaning, while Lenina stiffened and shrank, so close that the blown reek of embryo-poison stirred the hair on her cheek. “For instance,” she hoarsely whispered, “take the way they have one another here. Mad, I tell you, absolutely mad. Everybody belongs to every one else—don't they? don't they?” she insisted, tugging at Lenina's sleeve. Lenina nodded her averted head, let out the breath she had been holding and managed to draw another one, relatively untainted. “Well, here,” the other went on, “nobody's supposed to belong to more than one person. And if you have people in the ordinary way, the others think you're wicked and anti-social. They hate and despise you. Once a lot of women came and made a scene because their men came to see me. Well, why not? And then they rushed at me…No, it was too awful. I can't tell you about it.” Linda covered her face with her hands and shuddered. “They're so hateful, the women here. Mad, mad and cruel. And of course they don't know anything about Malthusian Drill, or bottles, or decanting, or anything of that sort. So they're having children all the time—like dogs. It's too revolting. And to think that I…Oh, Ford, Ford, Ford! And yet John was a great comfort to me. I don't know what I should have done without him. Even though he did get so upset whenever a man…Quite as a tiny boy, even. Once (but that was when he was bigger) he tried to kill poor Waihusiwa—or was it Popé?—just because I used to have them sometimes. Because I never could make him understand that that was what civilized people ought to do. Being mad's infectious, I believe. Anyhow, John seems to have caught it from the Indians. Because, of course, he was with them a lot. Even though they always were so beastly to him and wouldn't let him do all the things the other boys did. Which was a good thing in a way, because it made it easier for me to condition him a little. Though you've no idea how difficult that is. There's so much one doesn't know; it wasn't my business to know. I mean, when a child asks you how a helicopter works or who made the world—well, what are you to answer if you're a Beta and have always worked in the Fertilizing Room? What are you to answer?”





Chapter Eight


Outside, in the dust and among the garbage (there were four dogs now), Bernard and John were walking slowly up and down.

“So hard for me to realize,” Bernard was saying, “to reconstruct. As though we were living on different planets, in different centuries. A mother, and all this dirt, and gods, and old age, and disease…” He shook his head. “It's almost inconceivable. I shall never understand, unless you explain.”

“Explain what?”

“This.” He indicated the pueblo. “That.” And it was the little house outside the village. “Everything. All your life.”

“But what is there to say?”

“From the beginning. As far back as you can remember.”

“As far back as I can remember.” John frowned. There was a long silence.




It was very hot. They had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. Linda said, “Come and lie down, Baby.” They lay down together in the big bed. “Sing,” and Linda sang. Sang “Streptocock-Gee to Banbury-T” and “Bye Baby Banting, soon you'll need decanting.” Her voice got fainter and fainter…

There was a loud noise, and he woke with a start. A man was standing by the bed, enormous, frightening. He was saying something to Linda, and Linda was laughing. She had pulled the blanket up to her chin, but the man pulled it down again. His hair was like two black ropes, and round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with blue stones in it. He liked the bracelet; but all the same, he was frightened; he hid his face against Linda's body. Linda put her hand on him and he felt safer. In those other words he did not understand so well, she said to the man, “Not with John here.” The man looked at him, then again at Linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. Linda said, “No.” But the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. “No,” Linda said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. “No, no!” But the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. He screamed. The man put up his other hand and lifted him up. Linda was still holding him, still saying, “No, no.” The man said something short and angry, and suddenly her hands were gone. “Linda, Linda.” He kicked and wriggled; but the man carried him across to the door, opened it, put him down on the floor in the middle of the other room, and went away, shutting the door behind him. He got up, he ran to the door. Standing on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden latch. He lifted it and pushed; but the door wouldn't open. “Linda,” he shouted. She didn't answer.




He remembered a huge room, rather dark; and there were big wooden things with strings fastened to them, and lots of women standing round them—making blankets, Linda said. Linda told him to sit in the corner with the other children, while she went and helped the women. He played with the little boys for a long time. Suddenly people started talking very loud, and there were the women pushing Linda away, and Linda was crying. She went to the door and he ran after her. He asked her why they were angry. “Because I broke something,” she said. And then she got angry too. “How should I know how to do their beastly weaving?” she said. “Beastly savages.” He asked her what savages were. When they got back to their house, Popé was waiting at the door, and he came in with them. He had a big gourd full of stuff that looked like water; only it wasn't water, but something with a bad smell that burnt your mouth and made you cough. Linda drank some and Popé drank some, and then Linda laughed a lot and talked very loud; and then she and Popé went into the other room. When Popé went away, he went into the room. Linda was in bed and so fast asleep that he couldn't wake her.

Popé used to come often. He said the stuff in the gourd was called mescal; but Linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made you feel ill afterwards. He hated Popé. He hated them all—all the men who came to see Linda. One afternoon, when he had been playing with the other children—it was cold, he remembered, and there was snow on the mountains—he came back to the house and heard angry voices in the bedroom. They were women's voices, and they said words he didn't understand, but he knew they were dreadful words. Then suddenly, crash! something was upset; he heard people moving about quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like hitting a mule, only not so bony; then Linda screamed. “Oh, don't, don't, don't!” she said. He ran in. There were three women in dark blankets. Linda was on the bed. One of the women was holding her wrists. Another was lying across her legs, so that she couldn't kick. The third was hitting her with a whip. Once, twice, three times; and each time Linda screamed. Crying, he tugged at the fringe of the woman's blanket. “Please, please.” With her free hand she held him away. The whip came down again, and again Linda screamed. He caught hold of the woman's enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with all his might. She cried out, wrenched her hand free, and gave him such a push that he fell down. While he was lying on the ground she hit him three times with the whip. It hurt more than anything he had ever felt—like fire. The whip whistled again, fell. But this time it was Linda who screamed.

“But why did they want to hurt you, Linda?” he asked that night. He was crying, because the red marks of the whip on his back still hurt so terribly. But he was also crying because people were so beastly and unfair, and because he was only a little boy and couldn't do anything against them. Linda was crying too. She was grown up, but she wasn't big enough to fight against three of them. It wasn't fair for her either. “Why did they want to hurt you, Linda?”

“I don't know. How should I know?” It was difficult to hear what she said, because she was lying on her stomach and her face was in the pillow. “They say those men are their men,” she went on; and she did not seem to be talking to him at all; she seemed to be talking with some one inside herself. A long talk which he didn't understand; and in the end she started crying louder than ever.

“Oh, don't cry, Linda. Don't cry.”

He pressed himself against her. He put his arm round her neck. Linda cried out. “Oh, be careful. My shoulder! Oh!” and she pushed him away, hard. His head banged against the wall. “Little idiot!” she shouted; and then, suddenly, she began to slap him. Slap, slap…

“Linda,” he cried out. “Oh, mother, don't!”

“I'm not your mother. I won't be your mother.”

“But, Linda…Oh!” She slapped him on the cheek.

“Turned into a savage,” she shouted. “Having young ones like an animal…If it hadn't been for you, I might have gone to the Inspector, I might have got away. But not with a baby. That would have been too shameful.”

He saw that she was going to hit him again, and lifted his arm to guard his face. “Oh, don't, Linda, please don't.”

“Little beast!” She pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered.

“Don't, Linda.” He shut his eyes, expecting the blow.

But she didn't hit him. After a little time, he opened his eyes again and saw that she was looking at him. He tried to smile at her. Suddenly she put her arms round him and kissed him again and again.




Sometimes, for several days, Linda didn't get up at all. She lay in bed and was sad. Or else she drank the stuff that Popé brought and laughed a great deal and went to sleep. Sometimes she was sick. Often she forgot to wash him, and there was nothing to eat except cold tortillas. He remembered the first time she found those little animals in his hair, how she screamed and screamed.




The happiest times were when she told him about the Other Place. “And you really can go flying, whenever you like?”

“Whenever you like.” And she would tell him about the lovely music that came out of a box, and all the nice games you could play, and the delicious things to eat and drink, and the light that came when you pressed a little thing in the wall, and the pictures that you could hear and feel and smell, as well as see, and another box for making nice smells, and the pink and green and blue and silver houses as high as mountains, and everybody happy and no one ever sad or angry, and every one belonging to every one else, and the boxes where you could see and hear what was happening at the other side of the world, and babies in lovely clean bottles—everything so clean, and no nasty smells, no dirt at all—and people never lonely, but living together and being so jolly and happy, like the summer dances here in Malpais, but much happier, and the happiness being there every day, every day….He listened by the hour. And sometimes, when he and the other children were tired with too much playing, one of the old men of the pueblo would talk to them, in those other words, of the great Transformer of the World, and of the long fight between Right Hand and Left Hand, between Wet and Dry; of Awonawilona, who made a great fog by thinking in the night, and then made the whole world out of the fog; of Earth Mother and Sky Father; of Ahaiyuta and Marsailema, the twins of War and Chance; of Jesus and Pookong; of Mary and Etsanatlehi, the woman who makes herself young again; of the Black Stone at Laguna and the Great Eagle and Our Lady of Acoma. Strange stories, all the more wonderful to him for being told in the other words and so not fully understood. Lying in bed, he would think of Heaven and London and Our Lady of Acoma and the rows and rows of babies in clean bottles and Jesus flying up and Linda flying up and the great Director of World Hatcheries and Awonawilona.




Lots of men came to see Linda. The boys began to point their fingers at him. In the strange other words they said that Linda was bad; they called her names he did not understand, but that he knew were bad names. One day they sang a song about her, again and again. He threw stones at them. They threw back; a sharp stone cut his cheek. The blood wouldn't stop; he was covered with blood.




Linda taught him to read. With a piece of charcoal she drew pictures on the wall—an animal sitting down, a baby inside a bottle; then she wrote letters. THE CAT IS ON THE MAT. THE TOT IS IN THE POT. He learned quickly and easily. When he knew how to read all the words she wrote on the wall, Linda opened her big wooden box and pulled out from under those funny little red trousers she never wore a thin little book. He had often seen it before. “When you're bigger,” she had said, “you can read it.” Well, now he was big enough. He was proud. “I'm afraid you won't find it very exciting,” she said. “But it's the only thing I have.” She sighed. “If only you could see the lovely reading-machines we used to have in London!” He began reading. The Chemical and Bacteriological Conditioning of the Embryo. Practical Instructions for Beta Embryo-Store Workers. It took him a quarter of an hour to read the title alone. He threw the book on the floor. “Beastly, beastly book!” he said, and began to cry.




The boys still sang their horrible song about Linda. Sometimes, too, they laughed at him for being so ragged. When he tore his clothes, Linda did not know how to mend them. In the Other Place, she told him, people threw away clothes with holes in them and got new ones. “Rags, rags!” the boys used to shout at him. “But I can read,” he said to himself, “and they can't. They don't even know what reading is.” It was fairly easy, if he thought hard enough about the reading, to pretend that he didn't mind when they made fun of him. He asked Linda to give him the book again.

The more the boys pointed and sang, the harder he read. Soon he could read all the words quite well. Even the longest. But what did they mean? He asked Linda; but even when she could answer it didn't seem to make it very clear, And generally she couldn't answer at all.

“What are chemicals?” he would ask.

“Oh, stuff like magnesium salts, and alcohol for keeping the Deltas and Epsilons small and backward, and calcium carbonate for bones, and all that sort of thing.”

“But how do you make chemicals, Linda? Where do they come from?”

“Well, I don't know. You get them out of bottles. And when the bottles are empty, you send up to the Chemical Store for more. It's the Chemical Store people who make them, I suppose. Or else they send to the factory for them. I don't know. I never did any chemistry. My job was always with the embryos.”

It was the same with everything else he asked about. Linda never seemed to know. The old men of the pueblo had much more definite answers.

“The seed of men and all creatures, the seed of the sun and the seed of earth and the seed of the sky—Awonawilona made them all out of the Fog of Increase. Now the world has four wombs; and he laid the seeds in the lowest of the four wombs. And gradually the seeds began to grow…”

One day (John calculated later that it must have been soon after his twelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. It was a thick book and looked very old. The binding had been eaten by mice; some of its pages were loose and crumpled. He picked it up, looked at the title-page: the book was called The Complete Works of William Shakespeare.

Linda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of a cup. “Popé brought it,” she said. Her voice was thick and hoarse like somebody else's voice. “It was lying in one of the chests of the Antelope Kiva. It's supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. I expect it's true, because I looked at it, and it seemed to be full of nonsense. Uncivilized. Still, it'll be good enough for you to practice your reading on.” She took a last sip, set the cup down on the floor beside the bed, turned over on her side, hiccoughed once or twice and went to sleep.

He opened the book at random.

Nay, but to live

In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,

Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love

Over the nasty sty…

The strange words rolled through his mind; rumbled, like talking thunder; like the drums at the summer dances, if the drums could have spoken; like the men singing the Corn Song, beautiful, beautiful, so that you cried; like old Mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone—kiathla tsilu silokwe silokwe. Kiai silu silu, tsith!—but better than Mitsima's magic, because it meant more, because it talked to him, talked wonderfully and only half-understandably, a terrible beautiful magic, about Linda; about Linda lying there snoring, with the empty cup on the floor beside the bed; about Linda and Popé, Linda and Popé.




He hated Popé more and more. A man can smile and smile and be a villain. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. What did the words exactly mean? He only half knew. But their magic was strong and went on rumbling in his head, and somehow it was as though he had never really hated Popé before; never really hated him because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. But now he had these words, these words like drums and singing and magic. These words and the strange, strange story out of which they were taken (he couldn't make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful, wonderful all the same)—they gave him a reason for hating Popé; and they made his hatred more real; they even made Popé himself more real.

One day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room was open, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep—white Linda and Popé almost black beside her, with one arm under her shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast, and one of the plaits of his long hair lying across her throat, like a black snake trying to strangle her. Popé's gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near the bed. Linda was snoring.

His heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. He was empty. Empty, and cold, and rather sick, and giddy. He leaned against the wall to steady himself. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous…Like drums, like the men singing for the corn, like magic, the words repeated and repeated themselves in his head. From being cold he was suddenly hot. His cheeks burnt with the rush of blood, the room swam and darkened before his eyes. He ground his teeth. “I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll kill him,” he kept saying. And suddenly there were more words.

When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage

Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed…

The magic was on his side, the magic explained and gave orders. He stepped back in the outer room. “When he is drunk asleep…” The knife for the meat was lying on the floor near the fireplace. He picked it up and tiptoed to the door again. “When he is drunk asleep, drunk asleep…” He ran across the room and stabbed—oh, the blood!—stabbed again, as Popé heaved out of his sleep, lifted his hand to stab once more, but found his wrist caught, held and—oh, oh!—twisted. He couldn't move, he was trapped, and there were Popé's small black eyes, very close, staring into his own. He looked away. There were two cuts on Popé's left shoulder. “Oh, look at the blood!” Linda was crying. “Look at the blood!” She had never been able to bear the sight of blood. Popé lifted his other hand—to strike him, he thought. He stiffened to receive the blow. But the hand only took him under the chin and turned his face, so that he had to look again into Popé's eyes. For a long time, for hours and hours. And suddenly—he couldn't help it—he began to cry. Popé burst out laughing. “Go,” he said, in the other Indian words. “Go, my brave Ahaiyuta.” He ran out into the other room to hide his tears.




“You are fifteen,” said old Mitsima, in the Indian words. “Now I may teach you to work the clay.”

Squatting by the river, they worked together.

“First of all,” said Mitsima, taking a lump of the wetted clay between his hands, “we make a little moon.” The old man squeezed the lump into a disk, then bent up the edges, the moon became a shallow cup.

Slowly and unskilfully he imitated the old man's delicate gestures.

“A moon, a cup, and now a snake.” Mitsima rolled out another piece of clay into a long flexible cylinder, trooped it into a circle and pressed it on to the rim of the cup. “Then another snake. And another. And another.” Round by round, Mitsima built up the sides of the pot; it was narrow, it bulged, it narrowed again towards the neck. Mitsima squeezed and patted, stroked and scraped; and there at last it stood, in shape the familiar water pot of Malpais, but creamy white instead of black, and still soft to the touch. The crooked parody of Mitsima's, his own stood beside it. Looking at the two pots, he had to laugh.

“But the next one will be better,” he said, and began to moisten another piece of clay.

To fashion, to give form, to feel his fingers gaining in skill and power—this gave him an extraordinary pleasure. “A, B, C, Vitamin D,” he sang to himself as he worked. “The fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea.” And Mitsima also sang—a song about killing a bear. They worked all day, and all day he was filled with an intense, absorbing happiness.

“Next winter,” said old Mitsima, “I will teach you to make the bow.”




He stood for a long time outside the house, and at last the ceremonies within were finished. The door opened; they came out. Kothlu came first, his right hand outstretched and tightly closed, as though over some precious jewel. Her clenched hand similarly outstretched, Kiakimé followed. They walked in silence, and in silence, behind them, came the brothers and sisters and cousins and all the troop of old people.

They walked out of the pueblo, across the mesa. At the edge of the cliff they halted, facing the early morning sun. Kothlu opened his hand. A pinch of corn meal lay white on the palm; he breathed on it, murmured a few words, then threw it, a handful of white dust, towards the sun. Kiakimé did the same. Then Kiakimé's father stepped forward, and holding up a feathered prayer stick, made a long prayer, then threw the stick after the corn meal.

“It is finished,” said old Mitsima in a loud voice. “They are married.”

“Well,” said Linda, as they turned away, “all I can say is, it does seem a lot of fuss to make about so little. In civilized countries, when a boy wants to have a girl, he just…But where are you going, John?”

He paid no attention to her calling, but ran on, away, away, anywhere to be by himself.

It is finished. Old Mitsima's words repeated themselves in his mind. Finished, finished…In silence and from a long way off, but violently, desperately, hopelessly, he had loved Kiakimé. And now it was finished. He was sixteen.




At the full moon, in the Antelope Kiva, secrets would be told, secrets would be done and borne. They would go down, boys, into the kiva and come out again, men. The boys were all afraid and at the same time impatient. And at last it was the day. The sun went down, the moon rose. He went with the others. Men were standing, dark, at the entrance to the kiva; the ladder went down into the red lighted depths. Already the leading boys had begun to climb down. Suddenly, one of the men stepped forward, caught him by the arm, and pulled him out of the ranks. He broke free and dodged back into his place among the others. This time the man struck him, pulled his hair. “Not for you, white-hair!” “Not for the son of the she-dog,” said one of the other men. The boys laughed. “Go!” And as he still hovered on the fringes of the group, “Go!” the men shouted again. One of them bent down, took a stone, threw it. “Go, go, go!” There was a shower of stones. Bleeding, he ran away into the darkness. From the red-lit kiva came the noise of singing. The last of the boys had climbed down the ladder. He was all alone.

All alone, outside the pueblo, on the bare plain of the mesa. The rock was like bleached bones in the moonlight. Down in the valley, the coyotes were howling at the moon. The bruises hurt him, the cuts were still bleeding; but it was not for pain that he sobbed; it was because he was all alone, because he had been driven out, alone, into this skeleton world of rocks and moonlight. At the edge of the precipice he sat down. The moon was behind him; he looked down into the black shadow of the mesa, into the black shadow of death. He had only to take one step, one little jump….He held out his right hand in the moonlight. From the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing. Every few seconds a drop fell, dark, almost colourless in the dead light. Drop, drop, drop. To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow…

He had discovered Time and Death and God.




“Alone, always alone,” the young man was saying.

The words awoke a plaintive echo in Bernard's mind. Alone, alone…“So am I,” he said, on a gush of confidingness. “Terribly alone.”

“Are you?” John looked surprised. “I thought that in the Other Place…I mean, Linda always said that nobody was ever alone there.”

Bernard blushed uncomfortably. “You see,” he said, mumbling and with averted eyes, “I'm rather different from most people, I suppose. If one happens to be decanted different…”

“Yes, that's just it.” The young man nodded. “If one's different, one's bound to be lonely. They're beastly to one. Do you know, they shut me out of absolutely everything? When the other boys were sent out to spend the night on the mountains—you know, when you have to dream which your sacred animal is—they wouldn't let me go with the others; they wouldn't tell me any of the secrets. I did it by myself, though,” he added. “Didn't eat anything for five days and then went out one night alone into those mountains there.” He pointed.

Patronizingly, Bernard smiled. “And did you dream of anything?” he asked.

The other nodded. “But I mustn't tell you what.” He was silent for a little; then, in a low voice, “Once,” he went on, “I did something that none of the others did: I stood against a rock in the middle of the day, in summer, with my arms out, like Jesus on the Cross.”

“What on earth for?”

“I wanted to know what it was like being crucified. Hanging there in the sun…”

“But why?”

“Why? Well…” He hesitated. “Because I felt I ought to. If Jesus could stand it. And then, if one has done something wrong…Besides, I was unhappy; that was another reason.”

“It seems a funny way of curing your unhappiness,” said Bernard. But on second thoughts he decided that there was, after all, some sense in it. Better than taking soma…

“I fainted after a time,” said the young man. “Fell down on my face. Do you see the mark where I cut myself?” He lifted the thick yellow hair from his forehead. The scar showed, pale and puckered, on his right temple.

Bernard looked, and then quickly, with a little shudder, averted his eyes. His conditioning had made him not so much pitiful as profoundly squeamish. The mere suggestion of illness or wounds was to him not only horrifying, but even repulsive and rather disgusting. Like dirt, or deformity, or old age. Hastily he changed the subject.

“I wonder if you'd like to come back to London with us?” he asked, making the first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been secretly elaborating ever since, in the little house, he had realized who the “father” of this young savage must be. “Would you like that?”

The young man's face lit up. “Do you really mean it?”

“Of course; if I can get permission, that is.”

“Linda too?”

“Well…” He hesitated doubtfully. That revolting creature! No, it was impossible. Unless, unless…It suddenly occurred to Bernard that her very revoltingness might prove an enormous asset. “But of course!” he cried, making up for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cordiality.

The young man drew a deep breath. “To think it should be coming true—what I've dreamt of all my life. Do you remember what Miranda says?”

“Who's Miranda?”

But the young man had evidently not heard the question. “O wonder!” he was saying; and his eyes shone, his face was brightly flushed. “How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!” The flush suddenly deepened; he was thinking of Lenina, of an angel in bottle-green viscose, lustrous with youth and skin food, plump, benevolently smiling. His voice faltered. “O brave new world,” he began, then suddenly interrupted himself; the blood had left his cheeks; he was as pale as paper. “Are you married to her?” he asked.

“Am I what?”

“Married. You know—for ever. They say ‘for ever’ in the Indian words; it can't be broken.”

“Ford, no!” Bernard couldn't help laughing.

John also laughed, but for another reason—laughed for pure joy.

“O brave new world,” he repeated. “O brave new world that has such people in it. Let's start at once.”

“You have a most peculiar way of talking sometimes,” said Bernard, staring at the young man in perplexed astonishment. “And, anyhow, hadn't you better wait till you actually see the new world?”





Chapter Nine


Lenina felt herself entitled, after this day of queerness and horror, to a complete and absolute holiday. As soon as they got back to the rest-house, she swallowed six half-gramme tablets of soma, lay down on her bed, and within ten minutes had embarked for lunar eternity. It would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again.

Bernard meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. It was long after midnight before he fell asleep. Long after midnight; but his insomnia had not been fruitless; he had a plan.

Punctually, on the following morning, at ten o'clock, the green-uniformed octoroon stepped out of his helicopter. Bernard was waiting for him among the agaves.

“Miss Crowne's gone on soma-holiday,” he explained. “Can hardly be back before five. Which leaves us seven hours.”

He could fly to Santa Fé, do all the business he had to do, and be in Malpais again long before she woke up.

“She'll be quite safe here by herself?”

“Safe as helicopters,” the octoroon assured him.

They climbed into the machine and started off at once. At ten thirty-four they landed on the roof of the Santa Fé Post Office; at ten thirty-seven Bernard had got through to the World Controller's Office in Whitehall; at ten thirty-seven he was speaking to his fordship's fourth personal secretary; at ten forty-four he was repeating his story to the first secretary, and at ten forty-seven and a half it was the deep, resonant voice of Mustapha Mond himself that sounded in his ears.

“I ventured to think,” stammered Bernard, “that your fordship might find the matter of sufficient scientific interest…”

“Yes, I do find it of sufficient scientific interest,” said the deep voice. “Bring these two individuals back to London with you.”

“Your fordship is aware that I shall need a special permit…”

“The necessary orders,” said Mustapha Mond, “are being sent to the Warden of the Reservation at this moment. You will proceed at once to the Warden's Office. Good-morning, Mr. Marx.”

There was silence. Bernard hung up the receiver and hurried up to the roof.

“Warden's Office,” he said to the Gamma-green octoroon.

At ten fifty-four Bernard was shaking hands with the Warden.

“Delighted, Mr. Marx, delighted.” His boom was deferential. “We have just received special orders…”

“I know,” said Bernard, interrupting him. “I was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.” His bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. He dropped into a chair. “If you'll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as possible. As soon as possible,” he emphatically repeated. He was thoroughly enjoying himself.

At eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket.

“So long,” he said patronizingly to the Warden, who had accompanied him as far as the lift gates. “So long.”

He walked across to the hotel, had a bath, a vibro-vac massage, and an electrolytic shave, listened in to the morning's news, looked in for half an hour on the televisor, ate a leisured luncheon, and at half-past two flew back with the octoroon to Malpais.




The young man stood outside the rest-house.

“Bernard,” he called. “Bernard!” There was no answer.

Noiseless on his deerksin moccasins, he ran up the steps and tried the door. The door was locked.

They were gone! Gone! It was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to him. She had asked him to come and see them, and now they were gone. He sat down on the steps and cried.

Half an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. The first thing he saw was a green suitcase, with the initials L.C. painted on the lid. Joy flared up like fire within him. He picked up a stone. The smashed glass tinkled on the floor. A moment later he was inside the room. He opened the green suit-case; and all at once he was breathing Lenina's perfume, filling his lungs with her essential being. His heart beat wildly; for a moment he was almost faint. Then, bending over the precious box, he touched, he lifted into the light, he examined. The zippers on Lenina's spare pair of viscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle, then solved, a delight. Zip, and then zip; zip, and then zip; he was enchanted. Her green slippers were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. He unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks, blushed, put them hastily away again; but kissed a perfumed acetate handkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. Opening a box, he spilt a cloud of scented powder. His hands were floury with the stuff. He wiped them on his chest, on his shoulders, on his bare arms. Delicious perfume! He shut his eyes; he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. Touch of smooth skin against his face, scent in his nostrils of musky dust—her real presence. “Lenina,” he whispered. “Lenina!”

A noise made him start, made him guiltily turn. He crammed up his thieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid; then listened again, looked. Not a sign of life, not a sound. And yet he had certainly heard something—something like a sigh, something like the creak of a board. He tiptoed to the door and, cautiously opening it, found himself looking on to a broad landing. On the opposite side of the landing was another door, ajar. He stepped out, pushed, peeped.

There, on a low bed, the sheet flung back, dressed in a pair of pink one-piece zippyjamas, lay Lenina, fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of her curls, so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping face, so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs, that the tears came to his eyes.

With an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions—for nothing short of a pistol shot could have called Lenina back from her soma-holiday before the appointed time—he entered the room, he knelt on the floor beside the bed. He gazed, he clasped his hands, his lips moved. “Her eyes,” he murmured,

“Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;

Handlest in thy discourse, O! that her hand,

In whose comparison all whites are ink

Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure

The cygnet's down is harsh…”

A fly buzzed round her; he waved it away. “Flies,” he remembered,

“On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand, may seize

And steal immortal blessing from her lips,

Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,

Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.”

Very slowly, with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to stroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird, he put out his hand. It hung there trembling, within an inch of those limp fingers, on the verge of contact. Did he dare? Dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that…No, he didn't. The bird was too dangerous. His hand dropped back. How beautiful she was! How beautiful!

Then suddenly he found himself reflecting that he had only to take hold of the zipper at her neck and give one long, strong pull…He shut his eyes, he shook his head with the gesture of a dog shaking its ears as it emerges from the water. Detestable thought! He was ashamed of himself. Pure and vestal modesty…

There was a humming in the air. Another fly trying to steal immortal blessings? A wasp? He looked, saw nothing. The humming grew louder and louder, localized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. The plane! In a panic, he scrambled to his feet and ran into the other room, vaulted through the open window, and hurrying along the path between the tall agaves was in time to receive Bernard Marx as he climbed out of the helicopter.





Chapter Ten


The hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the Bloomsbury Centre's four thousand rooms marked twenty-seven minutes past two. “This hive of industry,” as the Director was fond of calling it, was in the full buzz of work. Every one was busy, everything in ordered motion. Under the microscopes, their long tails furiously lashing, spermatozoa were burrowing head first into eggs; and, fertilized, the eggs were expanding, dividing, or if bokanovskified, budding and breaking up into whole populations of separate embryos. From the Social Predestination Room the escalators went rumbling down into the basement, and there, in the crimson darkness, stewingly warm on their cushion of peritoneum and gorged with blood-surrogate and hormones, the foetuses grew and grew or, poisoned, languished into a stunted Epsilonhood. With a faint hum and rattle the moving racks crawled imperceptibly through the weeks and the recapitulated aeons to where, in the Decanting Room, the newly-unbottled babes uttered their first yell of horror and amazement.

The dynamos purred in the sub-basement, the lifts rushed up and down. On all the eleven floors of Nurseries it was feeding time. From eighteen hundred bottles eighteen hundred carefully labelled infants were simultaneously sucking down their pint of pasteurized external secretion.

Above them, in ten successive layers of dormitory, the little boys and girls who were still young enough to need an afternoon sleep were as busy as every one else, though they did not know it, listening unconsciously to hypnopaedic lessons in hygiene and sociability, in class-consciousness and the toddler's love-life. Above these again were the playrooms where, the weather having turned to rain, nine hundred older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay modelling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play.

Buzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. Blithe was the singing of the young girls over their test-tubes, the Predestinators whistled as they worked, and in the Decanting Room what glorious jokes were cracked above the empty bottles! But the Director's face, as he entered the Fertilizing Room with Henry Foster, was grave, wooden with severity.

“A public example,” he was saying. “In this room, because it contains more high-caste workers than any other in the Centre. I have told him to meet me here at half-past two.”

“He does his work very well,” put in Henry, with hypocritical generosity.

“I know. But that's all the more reason for severity. His intellectual eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. The greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray. It is better that one should suffer than that many should be corrupted. Consider the matter dispassionately, Mr. Foster, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour. Murder kills only the individual—and, after all, what is an individual?” With a sweeping gesture he indicated the rows of microscopes, the test-tubes, the incubators. “We can make a new one with the greatest ease—as many as we like. Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself. Yes, at Society itself,” he repeated. “Ah, but here he comes.”

Bernard had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of fertilizers towards them. A veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly concealed his nervousness. The voice in which he said, “Good-morning, Director,” was absurdly too loud; that in which, correcting his mistake, he said, “You asked me to come and speak to you here,” ridiculously soft, a squeak.

“Yes, Mr. Marx,” said the Director portentously. “I did ask you to come to me here. You returned from your holiday last night, I understand.”

“Yes,” Bernard answered.

“Yes-s,” repeated the Director, lingering, a serpent, on the “s.” Then, suddenly raising his voice, “Ladies and gentlemen,” he trumpeted, “ladies and gentlemen.”

The singing of the girls over their test-tubes, the preoccupied whistling of the Microscopists, suddenly ceased. There was a profound silence; every one looked round.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” the Director repeated once more, “excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. A painful duty constrains me. The security and stability of Society are in danger. Yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. This man,” he pointed accusingly at Bernard, “this man who stands before you here, this Alpha-Plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence, so much must be expected, this colleague of yours—or should I anticipate and say this ex-colleague? —has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. By his heretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of Our Ford and behave out of office hours ‘like a babe in a bottle,’” (here the Director made the sign of the T), “he has proved himself an enemy of Society, a subverter, ladies and gentlemen, of all Order and Stability, a conspirator against Civilization itself. For this reason I propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this Centre; I propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a Sub-Centre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may serve the best interest of Society, as far as possible removed from any important Centre of population. In Iceland he will have small opportunity to lead others astray by his unfordly example.” The Director paused; then, folding his arms, he turned impressively to Bernard. “Marx,” he said, “can you show any reason why I should not now execute the judgment passed upon you?”

“Yes, I can,” Bernard answered in a very loud voice.

Somewhat taken aback, but still majestically, “Then show it,” said the Director.

“Certainly. But it's in the passage. One moment.” Bernard hurried to the door and threw it open. “Come in,” he commanded, and the reason came in and showed itself.

There was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl screamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. Bloated, sagging, and among those firm youthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying monster of middle-agedness, Linda advanced into the room, coquettishly smiling her broken and discoloured smile, and rolling as she walked, with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation, her enormous haunches. Bernard walked beside her.

“There he is,” he said, pointing at the Director.

“Did you think I didn't recognize him?” Linda asked indignantly; then, turning to the Director, “Of course I knew you; Tomakin, I should have known you anywhere, among a thousand. But perhaps you've forgotten me. Don't you remember? Don't you remember, Tomakin? Your Linda.” She stood looking at him, her head on one side, still smiling, but with a smile that became progressively, in face of the Director's expression of petrified disgust, less and less self-confident, that wavered and finally went out. “Don't you remember, Tomakin?” she repeated in a voice that trembled. Her eyes were anxious, agonized. The blotched and sagging face twisted grotesquely into the grimace of extreme grief. “Tomakin!” She held out her arms. Some one began to titter.

“What's the meaning,” began the Director, “of this monstrous…”

“Tomakin!” She ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest.

A howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.

“…this monstrous practical joke,” the Director shouted.

Red in the face, he tried to disengage himself from her embrace. Desperately she clung. “But I'm Linda, I'm Linda.’” The laughter drowned her voice. “You made me have a baby,” she screamed above the uproar. There was a sudden and appalling hush; eyes floated uncomfortably, not knowing where to look. The Director went suddenly pale, stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at her, horrified. “Yes, a baby—and I was its mother.” She flung the obscenity like a challenge into the outraged silence; then, suddenly breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with her hands, sobbing. “It wasn't my fault, Tomakin. Because I always did my drill, didn't I? Didn't I? Always…I don't know how…If you knew how awful, Tomakin…But he was a comfort to me, all the same.” Turning towards the door, “John!” she called. “John!”

He came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked round, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the room, fell on his knees in front of the Director, and said in a clear voice: “My father!”

The word (for “father” was not so much obscene as—with its connotation of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of child-bearing—merely gross, a scatological rather than a pornographic impropriety), the comically smutty word relieved what had become a quite intolerable tension. Laughter broke out, enormous, almost hysterical, peal after peal, as though it would never stop. My father—and it was the Director! My father! Oh Ford, oh Ford! That was really too good. The whooping and the roaring renewed themselves, faces seemed on the point of disintegration, tears were streaming. Six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. My father!

Pale, wild-eyed, the Director glared about him in an agony of bewildered humiliation.

My father! The laughter, which had shown signs of dying away, broke out again more loudly than ever. He put his hands over his ears and rushed out of the room.





Chapter Eleven


After the scene in the Fertilizing Room, all upper-caste London was wild to see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning—or rather the ex-Director, for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set foot inside the Centre again—had flopped down and called him (the joke was almost too good to be true!) “my father.” Linda, on the contrary, cut no ice; nobody had the smallest desire to see Linda. To say one was a mother—that was past a joke: it was an obscenity. Moreover, she wasn't a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else: so couldn't have really quaint ideas. Finally—and this was by far the strongest reason for people's not wanting to see poor Linda—there was her appearance. Fat; having lost her youth; with bad teeth, and a blotched complexion, and that figure (Ford!)—you simply couldn't look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively sick. So the best people were quite determined not to see Linda. And Linda, for her part, had no desire to see them. The return to civilization was for her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and taking holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache or a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt after peyotl, as though you'd done something so shamefully anti-social that you could never hold up your head again. Soma played none of these unpleasant tricks. The holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after was disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. The remedy was to make the holiday continuous. Greedily she clamoured for ever larger, ever more frequent doses. Dr. Shaw at first demurred; then let her have what she wanted. She took as much as twenty grammes a day.

“Which will finish her off in a month or two,” the doctor confided to Bernard. “One day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. No more breathing. Finished. And a good thing too. If we could rejuvenate, of course it would be different. But we can't.”

Surprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday Linda was most conveniently out of the way), John raised objections.

“But aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?”

“In one sense, yes,” Dr. Shaw admitted. “But in another we're actually lengthening it.” The young man stared, uncomprehending. “Soma may make you lose a few years in time,” the doctor went on. “But think of the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. Every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity.”

John began to understand. “Eternity was in our lips and eyes,” he murmured.

“Eh?”

“Nothing.”

“Of course,” Dr. Shaw went on, “you can't allow people to go popping off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. But as she hasn't got any serious work…”

“All the same,” John persisted, “I don't believe it's right.”

The doctor shrugged his shoulders. “Well, of course, if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time…”

In the end John was forced to give in. Linda got her soma. Thenceforward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of Bernard's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television always on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets within reach of her hand—there she remained; and yet wasn't there at all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beautifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping patchouli was more than scent—was the sun, was a million sexophones, was Popé making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and without end.

“No, we can't rejuvenate. But I'm very glad,” Dr. Shaw had concluded, “to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being. Thank you so much for calling me in.” He shook Bernard warmly by the hand.

It was John, then, they were all after. And as it was only through Bernard, his accredited guardian, that John could be seen, Bernard now found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, but as a person of outstanding importance. There was no more talk of the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appearance. Henry Foster went out of his way to be friendly; Benito Hoover made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum; the Assistant Predestinator came out and cadged almost abjectly for an invitation to one of Bernard's evening parties. As for the women, Bernard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and he could have whichever of them he liked.

“Bernard's asked me to meet the Savage next Wednesday,” Fanny announced triumphantly.

“I'm so glad,” said Lenina. “And now you must admit that you were wrong about Bernard. Don't you think he's really rather sweet?”

Fanny nodded. “And I must say,” she said, “I was quite agreeably surprised.”

The Chief Bottler, the Director of Predestination, three Deputy Assistant Fertilizer-Generals, the Professor of Feelies in the College of Emotional Engineering, the Dean of the Westminster Community Singery, the Supervisor of Bokanovskification—the list of Bernard's notabilities was interminable.

“And I had six girls last week,” he confided to Helmholtz Watson. “One on Monday, two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, and one on Saturday. And if I'd had the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen more who were only too anxious…”

Helmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapproving that Bernard was offended.

“You're envious,” he said.

Helmholtz shook his head. “I'm rather sad, that's all,” he answered.

Bernard went off in a huff. Never, he told himself, never would he speak to Helmholtz again.

The days passed. Success went fizzily to Bernard's head, and in the process completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a world which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. In so far as it recognized him as important, the order of things was good. But, reconciled by his success, he yet refused to forego the privilege of criticizing this order. For the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel larger. Moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. (At the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.) Before those who now, for the sake of the Savage, paid their court to him, Bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. He was politely listened to. But behind his back people shook their heads. “That young man will come to a bad end,” they said, prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. “He won't find another Savage to help him out a second time,” they said. Meanwhile, however, there was the first Savage; they were polite. And because they were polite, Bernard felt positively gigantic—gigantic and at the same time light with elation, lighter than air.




“Lighter than air,” said Bernard, pointing upwards.

Like a pearl in the sky, high, high above them, the Weather Department's captive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine.

“…the said Savage,” so ran Bernard's instructions, “to be shown civilized life in all its aspects….”

He was being shown a bird's-eye view of it at present, a bird's-eye view from the platform of the Charing-T Tower. The Station Master and the Resident Meteorologist were acting as guides. But it was Bernard who did most of the talking. Intoxicated, he was behaving as though, at the very least, he were a visiting World Controller. Lighter than air.

The Bombay Green Rocket dropped out of the sky. The passengers alighted. Eight identical Dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of the cabin—the stewards.

“Twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour,” said the Station Master impressively. “What do you think of that, Mr. Savage?”

John thought it very nice. “Still,” he said, “Ariel could put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.”

“The Savage,” wrote Bernard in his report to Mustapha Mond, “shows surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. This is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the woman Linda, his m—.”

(Mustapha Mond frowned. “Does the fool think I'm too squeamish to see the word written out at full length?”)

“Partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls ‘the soul,’ which he persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment, whereas, as I tried to point out to him…”

The Controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the page in search of something more interestingly concrete, when his eye was caught by a series of quite extraordinary phrases. “…though I must admit,” he read, “that I agree with the Savage in finding civilized infantility too easy or, as he puts it, not expensive enough; and I would like to take this opportunity of drawing your fordship's attention to…”

Mustapha Mond's anger gave place almost at once to mirth. The idea of this creature solemnly lecturing him—him—about the social order was really too grotesque. The man must have gone mad. “I ought to give him a lesson,” he said to himself; then threw back his head and laughed aloud. For the moment, at any rate, the lesson would not be given.




It was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters, a branch of the Electrical Equipment Corporation. They were met on the roof itself (for that circular letter of recommendation from the Controller was magical in its effects) by the Chief Technician and the Human Element Manager. They walked downstairs into the factory.

“Each process,” explained the Human Element Manager, “is carried out, so far as possible, by a single Bokanovsky Group.”

And, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese were working in the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.

“O brave new world…” By some malice of his memory the Savage found himself repeating Miranda's words. “O brave new world that has such people in it.”

“And I assure you,” the Human Element Manager concluded, as they left the factory, “we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. We always find…”

But the Savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was violently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket.




“The Savage,” wrote Bernard, “refuses to take soma, and seems much distressed because of the woman Linda, his m—, remains permanently on holiday. It is worthy of note that, in spite of his m—'s senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the Savage frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her—an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).”




At Eton they alighted on the roof of Upper School. On the opposite side of School Yard, the fifty-two stories of Lupton's Tower gleamed white in the sunshine. College on their left and, on their right, the School Community Singery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. In the centre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of Our Ford.

Dr. Gaffney, the Provost, and Miss Keate, the Head Mistress, received them as they stepped out of the plane.

“Do you have many twins here?” the Savage asked rather apprehensively, as they set out on their tour of inspection.

“Oh, no,” the Provost answered. “Eton is reserved exclusively for upper-caste boys and girls. One egg, one adult. It makes education more difficult, of course. But as they'll be called upon to take responsibilities and deal with unexpected emergencies, it can't be helped.” He sighed.

Bernard, meanwhile, had taken a strong fancy to Miss Keate. “If you're free any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening,” he was saying. Jerking his thumb towards the Savage, “He's curious, you know,” Bernard added. “Quaint.”

Miss Keate smiled (and her smile was really charming, he thought); said Thank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. The Provost opened a door.

Five minutes in that Alpha-Double-Plus classroom left John a trifle bewildered.

“What is elementary relativity?” he whispered to Bernard. Bernard tried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they should go to some other classroom.

From behind a door in the corridor leading to the Beta-Minus geography room, a ringing soprano voice called, “One, two, three, four,” and then, with a weary impatience, “As you were.”

“Malthusian Drill,” explained the Head Mistress. “Most of our girls are freemartins, of course. I'm a freemartin myself.” She smiled at Bernard. “But we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.”

In the Beta-Minus geography room John learnt that “a savage reservation is a place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the expense of civilizing.” A click; the room was darkened; and suddenly, on the screen above the Master's head, there were the Penitentes of Acoma prostrating themselves before Our Lady, and wailing as John had heard them wail, confessing their sins before Jesus on the Cross, before the eagle image of Pookong. The young Etonians fairly shouted with laughter. Still wailing, the Penitentes rose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips, began to beat themselves, blow after blow. Redoubled, the laughter drowned even the amplified record of their groans.

“But why do they laugh?” asked the Savage in a pained bewilderment.

“Why?” The Provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. “Why? But because it's so extraordinarily funny.”

In the cinematographic twilight, Bernard risked a gesture which, in the past, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. Strong in his new importance, he put his arm around the Head Mistress's waist. It yielded, willowily. He was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again.

“Perhaps we had better go on,” said Miss Keate, and moved towards the door.

“And this,” said the Provost a moment later, “is the Hypnopaedic Control Room.”

Hundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room; pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnopaedic lessons were printed.

“You slip the roll in here,” explained Bernard, interrupting Dr. Gaffney, “press down this switch…”

“No, that one,” corrected the Provost, annoyed.

“That one, then. The roll unwinds. The selenium cells transform the light impulses into sound waves, and…”

“And there you are,” Dr. Gaffney concluded.

“Do they read Shakespeare?” asked the Savage as they walked, on their way to the Biochemical Laboratories, past the School Library.

“Certainly not,” said the Head Mistress, blushing.

“Our library,” said Dr. Gaffney, “contains only books of reference. If our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. We don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.”

Five bus-loads of boys and girls, singing or in a silent embracement, rolled past them over the vitrified highway.

“Just returned,” explained Dr. Gaffney, while Bernard, whispering, made an appointment with the Head Mistress for that very evening, “from the Slough Crematorium. Death conditioning begins at eighteen months. Every tot spends two mornings a week in a Hospital for the Dying. All the best toys are kept there, and they get chocolate cream on death days. They learn to take dying as a matter of course.”

“Like any other physiological process,” put in the Head Mistress professionally.

Eight o'clock at the Savoy. It was all arranged.




On their way back to London they stopped at the Television Corporation's factory at Brentford.

“Do you mind waiting here a moment while I go and telephone?” asked Bernard.

The Savage waited and watched. The Main Day-Shift was just going off duty. Crowds of lower-caste workers were queued up in front of the monorail station—seven or eight hundred Gamma, Delta and Epsilon men and women, with not more than a dozen faces and statures between them. To each of them, with his or her ticket, the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pill-box. The long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward.

“What's in those” (remembering The Merchant of Venice) “those caskets?” the Savage enquired when Bernard had rejoined him.

“The day's soma ration,” Bernard answered rather indistinctly, for he was masticating a piece of Benito Hoover's chewing-gum. “They get it after their work's over. Four half-gramme tablets. Six on Saturdays.”

He took John's arm affectionately and they walked back towards the helicopter.




Lenina came singing into the Changing Room.

“You seem very pleased with yourself,” said Fanny.

“I am pleased,” she answered. Zip! “Bernard rang up half an hour ago.” Zip, zip! She stepped out of her shorts. “He has an unexpected engagement.” Zip! “Asked me if I'd take the Savage to the feelies this evening. I must fly.” She hurried away towards the bathroom.

“She's a lucky girl,” Fanny said to herself as she watched Lenina go.

There was no envy in the comment; good-natured Fanny was merely stating a fact. Lenina was lucky; lucky in having shared with Bernard a generous portion of the Savage's immense celebrity, lucky in reflecting from her insignificant person the moment's supremely fashionable glory. Had not the Secretary of the Young Women's Fordian Association asked her to give a lecture about her experiences? Had she not been invited to the Annual Dinner of the Aphroditaeum Club? Had she not already appeared in the Feelytone News—visibly, audibly and tactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet?

Hardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous individuals. The Resident World Controller's Second Secretary had asked her to dinner and breakfast. She had spent one week-end with the Ford Chief-Justice, and another with the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. The President of the Internal and External Secretions Corporation was perpetually on the phone, and she had been to Deauville with the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of Europe.

“It's wonderful, of course. And yet in a way,” she had confessed to Fanny, “I feel as though I were getting something on false pretences. Because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it's like to make love to a Savage. And I have to say I don't know.” She shook her head. “Most of the men don't believe me, of course. But it's true. I wish it weren't,” she added sadly and sighed. “He's terribly good-looking; don't you think so?”

“But doesn't he like you?” asked Fanny.

“Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn't. He always does his best to avoid me; goes out of the room when I come in; won't touch me; won't even look at me. But sometimes if I turn round suddenly, I catch him staring; and then—well, you know how men look when they like you.”

Yes, Fanny knew.

“I can't make it out,” said Lenina.

She couldn't make it out; and not only was bewildered; was also rather upset.

“Because, you see, Fanny, I like him.”

Liked him more and more. Well, now there'd be a real chance, she thought, as she scented herself after her bath. Dab, dab, dab—a real chance. Her high spirits overflowed in a song.

“Hug me till you drug me, honey;

Kiss me till I'm in a coma;

Hug me, honey, snuggly bunny;

Love's as good as soma.”

The scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing Herbal Capriccio—rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil, myrtle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and newmown hay (with occasional subtle touches of discord—a whiff of kidney pudding, the faintest suspicion of pig's dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause; the lights went up. In the synthetic music machine the sound-track roll began to unwind. It was a trio for hyper-violin, super-cello and oboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. Thirty or forty bars—and then, against this instrumental background, a much more than human voice began to warble; now throaty, now from the head, now hollow as a flute, now charged with yearning harmonics, it effortlessly passed from Gaspard's Forster's low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a trilled bat-note high above the highest C to which (in 1770, at the Ducal opera of Parma, and to the astonishment of Mozart) Lucrezia Ajugari, alone of all the singers in history, once piercingly gave utterance.

Sunk in their pneumatic stalls, Lenina and the Savage sniffed and listened. It was now the turn also for eyes and skin.

The house lights went down; fiery letters stood out solid and as though self-supported in the darkness. THREE WEEKS IN A HELICOPTER. AN ALL-SUPER-SINGING, SYNTHETIC-TALKING, COLOURED, STEREOSCOPIC FEELY. WITH SYNCHRONIZED SCENT ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT.

“Take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair,” whispered Lenina. “Otherwise you won't get any of the feely effects.”

The Savage did as he was told.

Those fiery letters, meanwhile, had disappeared; there were ten seconds of complete darkness; then suddenly, dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking than they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood, far more real than reality, there stood the stereoscopic images, locked in one another's arms, of a gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic Beta-Plus female.

The Savage started. That sensation on his lips! He lifted a hand to his mouth; the titillation ceased; let his hand fall back on the metal knob; it began again. The scent organ, meanwhile, breathed pure musk. Expiringly, a sound-track super-dove cooed “Oo-ooh”; and vibrating only thirty-two times a second, a deeper than African bass made answer: “Aa-aah.” “Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!” the stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous zones of the six thousand spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure. “Ooh…”

The plot of the film was extremely simple. A few minutes after the first Ooh's and Aah's (a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous bearskin, every hair of which—the Assistant Predestinator was perfectly right—could be separately and distinctly felt), the negro had a helicopter accident, fell on his head. Thump! what a twinge through the forehead! A chorus of ow's and aie's went up from the audience.

The concussion knocked all the negro's conditioning into a cocked hat. He developed for the Beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. She protested. He persisted. There were struggles, pursuits, an assault on a rival, finally a sensational kidnapping. The Beta blond was ravished away into the sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks in a wildly anti-social tête-à-tête with the black madman. Finally, after a whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy three handsome young Alphas succeeded in rescuing her. The negro was packed off to an Adult Re-conditioning Centre and the film ended happily and decorously, with the Beta blonde becoming the mistress of all her three rescuers. They interrupted themselves for a moment to sing a synthetic quartet, with full super-orchestral accompaniment and gardenias on the scent organ. Then the bearskin made a final appearance and, amid a blare of sexophones, the last stereoscopic kiss faded into darkness, the last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers, quivers ever more feebly, ever more faintly, and at last is quiet, quite still.

But for Lenina the moth did not completely die. Even after the lights had gone up, while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the lifts, its ghost still fluttered against her lips, still traced fine shuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. Her cheeks were flushed. She caught hold of the Savage's arm and pressed it, limp, against her side. He looked down at her for a moment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed of his desire. He was not worthy, not…Their eyes for a moment met. What treasures hers promised! A queen's ransom of temperament. Hastily he looked away, disengaged his imprisoned arm. He was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of.

“I don't think you ought to see things like that,” he said, making haste to transfer from Lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection.

“Things like what, John?”

“Like this horrible film.”

“Horrible?” Lenina was genuinely astonished. “But I thought it was lovely.”

“It was base,” he said indignantly, “it was ignoble.”

She shook her head. “I don't know what you mean.” Why was he so queer? Why did he go out of his way to spoil things?

In the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. Bound by strong vows that had never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run, he sat averted and in silence. Sometimes, as though a finger had plucked at some taut, almost breaking string, his whole body would shake with a sudden nervous start.

The taxicopter landed on the roof of Lenina's apartment house. “At last,” she thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. At last—even though he had been so queer just now. Standing under a lamp, she peered into her hand-mirror. At last. Yes, her nose was a bit shiny. She shook the loose powder from her puff. While he was paying off the taxi—there would just be time. She rubbed at the shininess, thinking: “He's terribly good-looking. No need for him to be shy like Bernard. And yet…Any other man would have done it long ago. Well, now at last.” That fragment of a face in the little round mirror suddenly smiled at her.

“Good-night,” said a strangled voice behind her. Lenina wheeled round. He was standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, waiting—but what for? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and all the time thinking, thinking—she could not imagine what extraordinary thoughts. “Good-night, Lenina,” he repeated, and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile.

“But, John…I thought you were…I mean, aren't you?…”

He shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. The cab shot up into the air.

Looking down through the window in the floor, the Savage could see Lenina's upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. The mouth was open, she was calling. Her foreshortened figure rushed away from him; the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness.

Five minutes later he was back in his room. From its hiding-place he took out his mouse-nibbled volume, turned with religious care its stained and crumbled pages, and began to read Othello. Othello, he remembered, was like the hero of Three Weeks in a Helicopter—a black man.

Drying her eyes, Lenina walked across the roof to the lift. On her way down to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. One gramme, she decided, would not be enough; hers had been more than a one-gramme affliction. But if she took two grammes, she ran the risk of not waking up in time to-morrow morning. She compromised and, into her cupped left palm, shook out three half-gramme tablets.





Chapter Twelve


Bernard had to shout through the locked door; the Savage would not open.

“But everybody's there, waiting for you.”

“Let them wait,” came back the muffled voice through the door.

“But you know quite well, John” (how difficult it is to sound persuasive at the top of one's voice!), “I asked them on purpose to meet you.”

“You ought to have asked me first whether I wanted to meet them.”

“But you always came before, John.”

“That's precisely why I don't want to come again.”

“Just to please me,” Bernard bellowingly wheedled. “Won't you come to please me?”

“No.”

“Do you seriously mean it?”

“Yes.”

Despairingly, “But what shall I do?” Bernard wailed.

“Go to hell!” bawled the exasperated voice from within.

“But the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury is there to-night.” Bernard was almost in tears.

“Ai yaa tákwa!” It was only in Zuñi that the Savage could adequately express what he felt about the Arch-Community-Songster. “Háni!” he added as an after-thought; and then (with what derisive ferocity!): “Sons éso tse-ná.” And he spat on the ground, as Popé might have done.

In the end Bernard had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and inform the impatient assembly that the Savage would not be appearing that evening. The news was received with indignation. The men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions. The higher their position in the hierarchy, the deeper their resentment.

“To play such a joke on me,” the Arch-Songster kept repeating, “on me!”

As for the women, they indignantly felt that they had been had on false pretences—had by a wretched little man who had had alcohol poured into his bottle by mistake—by a creature with a Gamma-Minus physique. It was an outrage, and they said so, more and more loudly. The Head Mistress of Eton was particularly scathing.

Lenina alone said nothing. Pale, her blue eyes clouded with an unwonted melancholy, she sat in a corner, cut off from those who surrounded her by an emotion which they did not share. She had come to the party filled with a strange feeling of anxious exultation. “In a few minutes,” she had said to herself, as she entered the room, “I shall be seeing him, talking to him, telling him” (for she had come with her mind made up) “that I like him—more than anybody I've ever known. And then perhaps he'll say…”

What would he say? The blood had rushed to her cheeks.

“Why was he so strange the other night, after the feelies? So queer. And yet I'm absolutely sure he really does rather like me. I'm sure…”

It was at this moment that Bernard had made his announcement; the Savage wasn't coming to the party.

Lenina suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the beginning of a Violent Passion Surrogate treatment—a sense of dreadful emptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. Her heart seemed to stop beating.

“Perhaps it's because he doesn't like me,” she said to herself. And at once this possibility became an established certainty: John had refused to come because he didn't like her. He didn't like her….

“It really is a bit too thick,” the Head Mistress of Eton was saying to the Director of Crematoria and Phosphorus Reclamation. “When I think that I actually…”

“Yes,” came the voice of Fanny Crowne, “it's absolutely true about the alcohol. Some one I know knew some one who was working in the Embryo Store at the time. She said to my friend, and my friend said to me…”

“Too bad, too bad,” said Henry Foster, sympathizing with the Arch-Community-Songster. “It may interest you to know that our ex-Director was on the point of transferring him to Iceland.”

Pierced by every word that was spoken, the tight balloon of Bernard's happy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. Pale, distraught, abject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering incoherent apologies, assuring them that next time the Savage would certainly be there, begging them to sit down and take a carotene sandwich, a slice of vitamin A pâté, a glass of champagne-surrogate. They duly ate, but ignored him; drank and were either rude to his face or talked to one another about him, loudly and offensively, as though he had not been there.

“And now, my friends,” said the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, in that beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings at Ford's Day Celebrations, “now, my friends, I think perhaps the time has come…” He rose, put down his glass, brushed from his purple viscose waistcoat the crumbs of a considerable collation, and walked towards the door.

Bernard darted forward to intercept him.

“Must you really, Arch-Songster?…It's very early still. I'd hoped you would…”

Yes, what hadn't he hoped, when Lenina confidentially told him that the Arch-Community-Songster would accept an invitation if it were sent. “He's really rather sweet, you know.” And she had shown Bernard the little golden zipper—fastening in the form of a T which the Arch-Songster had given her as a memento of the week-end she had spent at Lambeth. To meet the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury and Mr. Savage. Bernard had proclaimed his triumph on every invitation card. But the Savage had chosen this evening of all evenings to lock himself up in his room, to shout “Háni!” and even (it was lucky that Bernard didn't understand Zuñi) “Sons éso tse-ná!” What should have been the crowning moment of Bernard's whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation.

“I'd so much hoped…” he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the great dignitary with pleading and distracted eyes.

“My young friend,” said the Arch-Community-Songster in a tone of loud and solemn severity; there was a general silence. “Let me give you a word of advice.” He wagged his finger at Bernard. “Before it's too late. A word of good advice.” (His voice became sepulchral.) “Mend your ways, my young friend, mend your ways.” He made the sign of the T over him and turned away. “Lenina, my dear,” he called in another tone. “Come with me.”

Obediently, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to her) without elation, Lenina walked after him, out of the room. The other guests followed at a respectful interval. The last of them slammed the door. Bernard was all alone.

Punctured, utterly deflated, he dropped into a chair and, covering his face with his hands, began to weep. A few minutes later, however, he thought better of it and took four tablets of soma.




Upstairs in his room the Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet.




Lenina and the Arch-Community-Songster stepped out on to the roof of Lambeth Palace. “Hurry up, my young friend—I mean, Lenina,” called the Arch-Songster impatiently from the lift gates. Lenina, who had lingered for a moment to look at the moon, dropped her eyes and came hurrying across the roof to rejoin him.




“A New Theory of Biology” was the title of the paper which Mustapha Mond had just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: “The author's mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. Not to be published.” He underlined the words. “The author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine Biological Station of St. Helena may become necessary.” A pity, he thought, as he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose—well, you didn't know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes—make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere, that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the words “Not to be published” drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed. “What fun it would be,” he thought, “if one didn't have to think about happiness!”




With closed eyes, his face shining with rapture, John was softly declaiming to vacancy:

“Oh! she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night,

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;

Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear…”

The golden T lay shining on Lenina's bosom. Sportively, the Arch-Community-Songster caught hold of it, sportively he pulled, pulled. “I think,” said Lenina suddenly, breaking a long silence, “I'd better take a couple of grammes of soma.”




Bernard, by this time, was fast asleep and smiling at the private paradise of his dreams. Smiling, smiling. But inexorably, every thirty seconds, the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost imperceptible click. Click, click, click, click…And it was morning. Bernard was back among the miseries of space and time. It was in the lowest spirits that he taxied across to his work at the Conditioning Centre. The intoxication of success had evaporated; he was soberly his old self; and by contrast with the temporary balloon of these last weeks, the old self seemed unprecedentedly heavier than the surrounding atmosphere.

To this deflated Bernard the Savage showed himself unexpectedly sympathetic.

“You're more like what you were at Malpais,” he said, when Bernard had told him his plaintive story. “Do you remember when we first talked together? Outside the little house. You're like what you were then.”

“Because I'm unhappy again; that's why.”

“Well, I'd rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness you were having here.”

“I like that,” said Bernard bitterly. “When it's you who were the cause of it all. Refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me!” He knew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice; he admitted inwardly, and at last even aloud, the truth of all that the Savage now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. But in spite of this knowledge and these admissions, in spite of the fact that his friend's support and sympathy were now his only comfort, Bernard continued perversely to nourish, along with his quite genuine affection, a secret grievance against the Savage, to mediate a campaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. Nourishing a grievance against the Arch-Community-Songster was useless; there was no possibility of being revenged on the Chief Bottler or the Assistant Predestinator. As a victim, the Savage possessed, for Bernard, this enormous superiority over the others: that he was accessible. One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.

Bernard's other victim-friend was Helmholtz. When, discomfited, he came and asked once more for the friendship which, in his prosperity, he had not thought it worth his while to preserve, Helmholtz gave it; and gave it without a reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel. Touched, Bernard felt himself at the same time humiliated by this magnanimity—a magnanimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more humiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to Helmholtz's character. It was the Helmholtz of daily life who forgot and forgave, not the Helmholtz of a half-gramme holiday. Bernard was duly grateful (it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again) and also duly resentful (it would be pleasure to take some revenge on Helmholtz for his generosity).

At their first meeting after the estrangement, Bernard poured out the tale of his miseries and accepted consolation. It was not till some days later that he learned, to his surprise and with a twinge of shame, that he was not the only one who had been in trouble. Helmholtz had also come into conflict with Authority.

“It was over some rhymes,” he explained. “I was giving my usual course of Advanced Emotional Engineering for Third Year Students. Twelve lectures, of which the seventh is about rhymes. ‘On the Use of Rhymes in Moral Propaganda and Advertisement,’ to be precise. I always illustrate my lecture with a lot of technical examples. This time I thought I'd give them one I'd just written myself. Pure madness, of course; but I couldn't resist it.” He laughed. “I was curious to see what their reactions would be. Besides,” he added more gravely, “I wanted to do a bit of propaganda; I was trying to engineer them into feeling as I'd felt when I wrote the rhymes. Ford!” He laughed again. “What an outcry there was! The Principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. I'm a marked man.”

“But what were your rhymes?” Bernard asked.

“They were about being alone.”

Bernard's eyebrows went up.

“I'll recite them to you, if you like.” And Helmholtz began:

“Yesterday's committee,

Sticks, but a broken drum,

Midnight in the City,

Flutes in a vacuum,

Shut lips, sleeping faces,

Every stopped machine,

The dumb and littered places

Where crowds have been—

All silences rejoice,

Weep (loudly or low),

Speak—but with the voice

Of whom, I do not know.



Absence, say, of Susan's,

Absence of Egeria's

Arms and respective bosoms,

Lips and, ah, posteriors,

Slowly form a presence;

Whose? And I ask, of what

So absurd an essence,

That something, which is not,

Nevertheless should populate

Empty night more solidly

Than that with which we copulate,

Why should it seem so squalidly?

Well, I gave them that as an example, and they reported me to the Principal.”

“I'm not surprised,” said Bernard. “It's flatly against all their sleep-teaching. Remember, they've had at least a quarter of a million warnings against solitude.”

“I know. But I thought I'd like to see what the effect would be.”

“Well, you've seen now.”

Helmholtz only laughed. “I feel,” he said, after a silence, as though I were just beginning to have something to write about. As though I were beginning to be able to use that power I feel I've got inside me—that extra, latent power. Something seems to be coming to me.” In spite of all his troubles, he seemed, Bernard thought, profoundly happy.

Helmholtz and the Savage took to one another at once. So cordially indeed that Bernard felt a sharp pang of jealousy. In all these weeks he had never come to so close an intimacy with the Savage as Helmholtz immediately achieved. Watching them, listening to their talk, he found himself sometimes resentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. He was ashamed of his jealousy and alternately made efforts of will and took soma to keep himself from feeling it. But the efforts were not very successful; and between the soma-holidays there were, of necessity, intervals. The odious sentiment kept on returning.

At his third meeting with the Savage, Helmholtz recited his rhymes on Solitude.

“What do you think of them?” he asked when he had done.

The Savage shook his head. “Listen to this,” was his answer; and unlocking the drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book, he opened and read:

“Let the bird of loudest lay

On the sole Arabian tree,

Herald sad and trumpet be…”

Helmholtz listened with a growing excitement. At “sole Arabian tree” he started; at “thou shrieking harbinger” he smiled with sudden pleasure; at “every fowl of tyrant wing” the blood rushed up into his cheeks; but at “defunctive music” he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion. The Savage read on:

“Property was thus appall'd,

That the self was not the same;

Single nature's double name

Neither two nor one was call'd.

Reason in itself confounded

Saw division grow together…”

“Orgy-porgy!” said Bernard, interrupting the reading with a loud, unpleasant laugh. “It's just a Solidarity Service hymn.” He was revenging himself on his two friends for liking one another more than they liked him.

In the course of their next two or three meetings he frequently repeated this little act of vengeance. It was simple and, since both Helmholtz and the Savage were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite poetic crystal, extremely effective. In the end, Helmholtz threatened to kick him out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. And yet, strangely enough, the next interruption, the most disgraceful of all, came from Helmholtz himself.

The Savage was reading Romeo and Juliet aloud—reading (for all the time he was seeing himself as Romeo and Lenina as Juliet) with an intense and quivering passion. Helmholtz had listened to the scene of the lovers' first meeting with a puzzled interest. The scene in the orchard had delighted him with its poetry; but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. Getting into such a state about having a girl—it seemed rather ridiculous. But, taken detail by verbal detail, what a superb piece of emotional engineering! “That old fellow,” he said, “he makes our best propaganda technicians look absolutely silly.” The Savage smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading. All went tolerably well until, in the last scene of the third act, Capulet and Lady Capulet began to bully Juliet to marry Paris. Helmholtz had been restless throughout the entire scene; but when, pathetically mimed by the Savage, Juliet cried out:

“Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,

That sees into the bottom of my grief?

O sweet my mother, cast me not away:

Delay this marriage for a month, a week;

Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed

In that dim monument where Tybalt lies…”

when Juliet said this, Helmholtz broke out in an explosion of uncontrolla-ble guffawing.

The mother and father (grotesque obscenity) forcing the daughter to have some one she didn't want! And the idiotic girl not saying that she was having some one else whom (for the moment, at any rate) she preferred! In its smutty absurdity the situation was irresistibly comical. He had managed, with a heroic effort, to hold down the mounting pressure of his hilarity; but “sweet mother” (in the Savage's tremulous tone of anguish) and the reference to Tybalt lying dead, but evidently uncremated and wasting his phosphorus on a dim monument, were too much for him. He laughed and laughed till the tears streamed down his face—quenchlessly laughed while, pale with a sense of outrage, the Savage looked at him over the top of his book and then, as the laughter still continued, closed it indignantly, got up and, with the gesture of one who removes his pearl from before swine, locked it away in its drawer.

“And yet,” said Helmholtz when, having recovered breath enough to apologize, he had mollified the Savage into listening to his explanations, “I know quite well that one needs ridiculous, mad situations like that; one can't write really well about anything else. Why was that old fellow such a marvellous propaganda technician? Because he had so many insane, excruciating things to get excited about. You've got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you can't think of the really good, penetrating, X-rayish phrases. But fathers and mothers!” He shook his head. “You can't expect me to keep a straight face about fathers and mothers. And who's going to get excited about a boy having a girl or not having her?” (The Savage winced; but Helmholtz, who was staring pensively at the floor, saw nothing.) “No.” he concluded, with a sigh, “it won't do. We need some other kind of madness and violence. But what? What? Where can one find it?” He was silent; then, shaking his head, “I don't know,” he said at last, “I don't know.”





Chapter Thirteen


Henry Foster loomed up through the twilight of the Embryo Store.

“Like to come to a feely this evening?”

Lenina shook her head without speaking.

“Going out with some one else?” It interested him to know which of his friends was being had by which other. “Is it Benito?” he questioned.

She shook her head again.

Henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes, the pallor beneath that glaze of lupus, the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crimson mouth. “You're not feeling ill, are you?” he asked, a trifle anxiously, afraid that she might be suffering from one of the few remaining infectious diseases.

Yet once more Lenina shook her head.

“Anyhow, you ought to go and see the doctor,” said Henry. “A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away,” he added heartily, driving home his hypnopaedic adage with a clap on the shoulder. “Perhaps you need a Pregnancy Substitute,” he suggested. “Or else an extra-strong V.P.S. treatment. Sometimes, you know, the standard passion surrogate isn't quite…”

“Oh, for Ford's sake,” said Lenina, breaking her stubborn silence, “shut up!” And she turned back to her neglected embryos.

A V.P.S. treatment indeed! She would have laughed, if she hadn't been on the point of crying. As though she hadn't got enough V.P. of her own! She sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. “John,” she murmured to herself, “John…” Then “My Ford,” she wondered, “have I given this one its sleeping sickness injection, or haven't I?” She simply couldn't remember. In the end, she decided not to run the risk of letting it have a second dose, and moved down the line to the next bottle.

Twenty-two years eight months and four days from that moment, a promising young Alpha-Minus administrator at Mwanza-Mwanza was to die of trypanosomiasis—the first case for over half a century. Sighing, Lenina went on with her work.

An hour later, in the Changing Room, Fanny was energetically protesting. “But it's absurd to let yourself get into a state like this. Simply absurd,” she repeated. “And what about? A man—one man.”

“But he's the one I want.”

“As though there weren't millions of other men in the world.”

“But I don't want them.”

“How can you know till you've tried?”

“I have tried.”

“But how many?” asked Fanny, shrugging her shoulders contemptuously. “One, two?”

“Dozens. But,” shaking her head, “it wasn't any good,” she added.

“Well, you must persevere,” said Fanny sententiously. But it was obvious that her confidence in her own prescriptions had been shaken. “Nothing can be achieved without perseverance.”

“But meanwhile…”

“Don't think of him.”

“I can't help it.”

“Take soma, then.”

“I do.”

“Well, go on.”

“But in the intervals I still like him. I shall always like him.”

“Well, if that's the case,” said Fanny, with decision, “why don't you just go and take him. Whether he wants it or no.”

“But if you knew how terribly queer he was!”

“All the more reason for taking a firm line.”

“It's all very well to say that.”

“Don't stand any nonsense. Act.” Fanny's voice was a trumpet; she might have been a Y. W. F. A. lecturer giving an evening talk to adolescent Beta-Minuses. “Yes, act—at once. Do it now.”

“I'd be scared,” said Lenina.

“Well, you've only got to take half a gramme of soma first. And now I'm going to have my bath.” She marched off, trailing her towel.




The bell rang, and the Savage, who was impatiently hoping that Helmholtz would come that afternoon (for having at last made up his mind to talk to Helmholtz about Lenina, he could not bear to postpone his confidences a moment longer), jumped up and ran to the door.

“I had a premonition it was you, Helmholtz,” he shouted as he opened.

On the threshold, in a white acetate-satin sailor suit, and with a round white cap rakishly tilted over her left ear, stood Lenina.

“Oh!” said the Savage, as though some one had struck him a heavy blow.

Half a gramme had been enough to make Lenina forget her fears and her embarrassments. “Hullo, John,” she said, smiling, and walked past him into the room. Automatically he closed the door and followed her. Lenina sat down. There was a long silence.

“You don't seem very glad to see me, John,” she said at last.

“Not glad?” The Savage looked at her reproachfully; then suddenly fell on his knees before her and, taking Lenina's hand, reverently kissed it. “Not glad? Oh, if you only knew,” he whispered and, venturing to raise his eyes to her face, “Admired Lenina,” he went on, “indeed the top of admiration, worth what's dearest in the world.” She smiled at him with a luscious tenderness. “Oh, you so perfect” (she was leaning towards him with parted lips), “so perfect and so peerless are created” (nearer and nearer) “of every creature's best.” Still nearer. The Savage suddenly scrambled to his feet. “That's why,” he said speaking with averted face, “I wanted to do something first…I mean, to show I was worthy of you. Not that I could ever really be that. But at any rate to show I wasn't absolutely unworthy. I wanted to do something.”

“Why should you think it necessary…” Lenina began, but left the sentence unfinished. There was a note of irritation in her voice. When one has leant forward, nearer and nearer, with parted lips—only to find oneself, quite suddenly, as a clumsy oaf scrambles to his feet, leaning towards nothing at all—well, there is a reason, even with half a gramme of soma circulating in one's blood-stream, a genuine reason for annoyance.

“At Malpais,” the Savage was incoherently mumbling, “you had to bring her the skin of a mountain lion—I mean, when you wanted to marry some one. Or else a wolf.”

“There aren't any lions in England,” Lenina almost snapped.

“And even if there were,” the Savage added, with sudden contemptuous resentment, “people would kill them out of helicopters, I suppose, with poison gas or something. I wouldn't do that, Lenina.” He squared his shoulders, he ventured to look at her and was met with a stare of annoyed incomprehension. Confused, “I'll do anything,” he went on, more and more incoherently. “Anything you tell me. There be some sports are painful—you know. But their labour delight in them sets off. That's what I feel. I mean I'd sweep the floor if you wanted.”

“But we've got vacuum cleaners here,” said Lenina in bewilderment. “It isn't necessary.”

“No, of course it isn't necessary. But some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone. I'd like to undergo something nobly. Don't you see?”

“But if there are vacuum cleaners…”

“That's not the point.”

“And Epsilon Semi-Morons to work them,” she went on, “well, really, why?”

“Why? But for you, for you. Just to show that I…”

“And what on earth vacuum cleaners have got to do with lions…”

“To show how much…”

“Or lions with being glad to see me…” She was getting more and more exasperated.

“How much I love you, Lenina,” he brought out almost desperately.

An emblem of the inner tide of startled elation, the blood rushed up into Lenina's cheeks. “Do you mean it, John?”

“But I hadn't meant to say so,” cried the Savage, clasping his hands in a kind of agony. “Not until…Listen, Lenina; in Malpais people get married.”

“Get what?” The irritation had begun to creep back into her voice. What was he talking about now?

“For always. They make a promise to live together for always.”

“What a horrible idea!” Lenina was genuinely shocked.

“Outliving beauty's outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays.”

“What?”

“It's like that in Shakespeare too. ‘If thou cost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite…’”

“For Ford's sake, John, talk sense. I can't understand a word you say. First it's vacuum cleaners; then it's knots. You're driving me crazy.” She jumped up and, as though afraid that he might run away from her physically, as well as with his mind, caught him by the wrist. “Answer me this question: do you really like me, or don't you?”

There was a moment's silence; then, in a very low voice, “I love you more than anything in the world,” he said.

“Then why on earth didn't you say so?” she cried, and so intense was her exasperation that she drove her sharp nails into the skin of his wrist. “Instead of drivelling away about knots and vacuum cleaners and lions, and making me miserable for weeks and weeks.”

She released his hand and flung it angrily away from her.

“If I didn't like you so much,” she said, “I'd be furious with you.”

And suddenly her arms were round his neck; he felt her lips soft against his own. So deliciously soft, so warm and electric that inevitably he found himself thinking of the embraces in Three Weeks in a Helicopter. Ooh! ooh! the stereoscopic blonde and anh! the more than real blackamoor. Horror, horror, horror…he tried to disengage himself; but Lenina tightened her embrace.

“Why didn't you say so?” she whispered, drawing back her face to look at him. Her eyes were tenderly reproachful.

“The murkiest den, the most opportune place” (the voice of conscience thundered poetically), “the strongest suggestion our worser genius can, shall never melt mine honour into lust. Never, never!” he resolved.

“You silly boy!” she was saying. “I wanted you so much. And if you wanted me too, why didn't you…?”

“But, Lenina…” he began protesting; and as she immediately untwined her arms, as she stepped away from him, he thought, for a moment, that she had taken his unspoken hint. But when she unbuckled her white patent cartridge belt and hung it carefully over the back of a chair, he began to suspect that he had been mistaken.

“Lenina!” he repeated apprehensively.

She put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull; her white sailor's blouse was ripped to the hem; suspicion condensed into a too, too solid certainty. “Lenina, what are you doing?”

Zip, zip! Her answer was wordless. She stepped out of her bell-bottomed trousers. Her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. The Arch-Community-Songster's golden T dangled at her breast.

“For those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men's eyes….” The singing, thundering, magical words made her seem doubly dangerous, doubly alluring. Soft, soft, but how piercing! boring and drilling into reason, tunnelling through resolution. “The strongest oaths are straw to the fire i' the blood. Be more abstemious, or else…”

Zip! The rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. A wriggle of the arms, a lifting first of the right foot, then the left: the zippicamiknicks were lying lifeless and as though deflated on the floor.

Still wearing her shoes and socks, and her rakishly tilted round white cap, she advanced towards him. “Darling. Darling! If only you'd said so before!” She held out her arms.

But instead of also saying “Darling!” and holding out his arms, the Savage retreated in terror, flapping his hands at her as though he were trying to scare away some intruding and dangerous animal. Four backwards steps, and he was brought to bay against the wall.

“Sweet!” said Lenina and, laying her hands on his shoulders, pressed herself against him. “Put your arms round me,” she commanded. “Hug me till you drug me, honey.” She too had poetry at her command, knew words that sang and were spells and beat drums. “Kiss me”; she closed her eyes, she let her voice sink to a sleepy murmur, “Kiss me till I'm in a coma. Hug me, honey, snuggly…”

The Savage caught her by the wrists, tore her hands from his shoulders, thrust her roughly away at arm's length.

“Ow, you're hurting me, you're…oh!” She was suddenly silent. Terror had made her forget the pain. Opening her eyes, she had seen his face—no, not his face, a ferocious stranger's, pale, distorted, twitching with some insane, inexplicable fury. Aghast, “But what is it, John?” she whispered. He did not answer, but only stared into her face with those mad eyes. The hands that held her wrists were trembling. He breathed deeply and irregularly. Faint almost to imperceptibility, but appalling, she suddenly heard the grinding of his teeth. “What is it?” she almost screamed.

And as though awakened by her cry he caught her by the shoulders and shook her. “Whore!” he shouted “Whore! Impudent strumpet!”

“Oh, don't, do-on't,” she protested in a voice made grotesquely tremulous by his shaking.

“Whore!”

“Plea-ease.”

“Damned whore!”

“A gra-amme is be-etter…” she began.

The Savage pushed her away with such force that she staggered and fell. “Go,” he shouted, standing over her menacingly, “get out of my sight or I'll kill you.” He clenched his fists.

Lenina raised her arm to cover her face. “No, please don't, John…”

“Hurry up. Quick!”

One arm still raised, and following his every movement with a terrified eye, she scrambled to her feet and still crouching, still covering her head, made a dash for the bathroom.

The noise of that prodigious slap by which her departure was accelerated was like a pistol shot.

“Ow!” Lenina bounded forward.

Safely locked into the bathroom, she had leisure to take stock of her injuries. Standing with her back to the mirror, she twisted her head. Looking over her left shoulder she could see the imprint of an open hand standing out distinct and crimson on the pearly flesh. Gingerly she rubbed the wounded spot.

Outside, in the other room, the Savage was striding up and down, marching, marching to the drums and music of magical words. “The wren goes to't and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.” Maddeningly they rumbled in his ears. “The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't with a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are Centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit. Beneath is all the fiends'. There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit, burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie, pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination.”

“John!” ventured a small ingratiating voice from the bathroom. “John!”

“O thou weed, who are so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee. Was this most goodly book made to write ‘whore’ upon? Heaven stops the nose at it…”

But her perfume still hung about him, his jacket was white with the powder that had scented her velvety body. “Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet.” The inexorable rhythm beat itself out. “Impudent…”

“John, do you think I might have my clothes?”

He picked up the bell-bottomed trousers, the blouse, the zippicamiknicks.

“Open!” he ordered, kicking the door.

“No, I won't.” The voice was frightened and defiant.

“Well, how do you expect me to give them to you?”

“Push them through the ventilator over the door.”

He did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the room. “Impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet. The devil Luxury with his fat rump and potato finger…”

“John.”

He would not answer. “Fat rump and potato finger.”

“John.”

“What is it?” he asked gruffly.

“I wonder if you'd mind giving me my Malthusian belt.”

Lenina sat, listening to the footsteps in the other room, wondering, as she listened, how long he was likely to go tramping up and down like that; whether she would have to wait until he left the flat; or if it would be safe, after allowing his madness a reasonable time to subside, to open the bathroom door and make a dash for it.

She was interrupted in the midst of these uneasy speculations by the sound of the telephone bell ringing in the other room. Abruptly the tramping ceased. She heard the voice of the Savage parleying with silence.

“Hullo.”

……

“Yes.”

……

“If I do not usurp myself, I am.”

……

“Yes, didn't you hear me say so? Mr. Savage speaking.”

……

“What? Who's ill? Of course it interests me.”

……

“But is it serious? Is she really bad? I'll go at once…”

……

“Not in her rooms any more? Where has she been taken?”

……

“Oh, my God! What's the address?”

……

“Three Park Lane—is that it? Three? Thanks.”

Lenina heard the click of the replaced receiver, then hurrying steps. A door slammed. There was silence. Was he really gone?

With an infinity of precautions she opened the door a quarter of an inch; peeped through the crack; was encouraged by the view of emptiness; opened a little further, and put her whole head out; finally tiptoed into the room; stood for a few seconds with strongly beating heart, listening, listening; then darted to the front door, opened, slipped through, slammed, ran. It was not till she was in the lift and actually dropping down the well that she began to feel herself secure.





Chapter Fourteen


The Park Lane Hospital for the Dying was a sixty-story tower of primrose tiles. As the Savage stepped out of his taxicopter a convoy of gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted away across the Park, westwards, bound for the Slough Crematorium. At the lift gates the presiding porter gave him the information he required, and he dropped down to Ward 81 (a Galloping Senility ward, the porter explained) on the seventeenth floor.

It was a large room bright with sunshine and yellow paint, and containing twenty beds, all occupied. Linda was dying in company—in company and with all the modern conveniences. The air was continuously alive with gay synthetic melodies. At the foot of every bed, confronting its moribund occupant, was a television box. Television was left on, a running tap, from morning till night. Every quarter of an hour the prevailing perfume of the room was automatically changed. “We try,” explained the nurse, who had taken charge of the Savage at the door, “we try to create a thoroughly pleasant atmosphere here—something between a first-class hotel and a feely-palace, if you take my meaning.”

“Where is she?” asked the Savage, ignoring these polite explanations.

The nurse was offended. “You are in a hurry,” she said.

“Is there any hope?” he asked.

“You mean, of her not dying?” (He nodded.) “No, of course there isn't. When somebody's sent here, there's no…” Startled by the expression of distress on his pale face, she suddenly broke off. “Why, whatever is the matter?” she asked. She was not accustomed to this kind of thing in visitors. (Not that there were many visitors anyhow: or any reason why there should be many visitors.) “You're not feeling ill, are you?”

He shook his head. “She's my mother,” he said in a scarcely audible voice.

The nurse glanced at him with startled, horrified eyes; then quickly looked away. From throat to temple she was all one hot blush.

“Take me to her,” said the Savage, making an effort to speak in an ordinary tone.

Still blushing, she led the way down the ward. Faces still fresh and unwithered (for senility galloped so hard that it had no time to age the cheeks—only the heart and brain) turned as they passed. Their progress was followed by the blank, incurious eyes of second infancy. The Savage shuddered as he looked.

Linda was lying in the last of the long row of beds, next to the wall. Propped up on pillows, she was watching the Semi-finals of the South American Riemann-Surface Tennis Championship, which were being played in silent and diminished reproduction on the screen of the television box at the foot of the bed. Hither and thither across their square of illuminated glass the little figures noiselessly darted, like fish in an aquarium—the silent but agitated inhabitants of another world.

Linda looked on, vaguely and uncomprehendingly smiling. Her pale, bloated face wore an expression of imbecile happiness. Every now and then her eyelids closed, and for a few seconds she seemed to be dozing. Then with a little start she would wake up again—wake up to the aquarium antics of the Tennis Champions, to the Super-Vox-Wurlitzeriana rendering of “Hug me till you drug me, honey,” to the warm draught of verbena that came blowing through the ventilator above her head—would wake to these things, or rather to a dream of which these things, transformed and embellished by the soma in her blood, were the marvellous constituents, and smile once more her broken and discoloured smile of infantile contentment.

“Well, I must go,” said the nurse. “I've got my batch of children coming. Besides, there's Number 3.” She pointed up the ward. “Might go off any minute now. Well, make yourself comfortable.” She walked briskly away.

The Savage sat down beside the bed.

“Linda,” he whispered, taking her hand.

At the sound of her name, she turned. Her vague eyes brightened with recognition. She squeezed his hand, she smiled, her lips moved; then quite suddenly her head fell forward. She was asleep. He sat watching her—seeking through the tired flesh, seeking and finding that young, bright face which had stooped over his childhood in Malpais, remembering (and he closed his eyes) her voice, her movements, all the events of their life together. “Streptocock-Gee to Banbury T…” How beautiful her singing had been! And those childish rhymes, how magically strange and mysterious!

A, B, C, vitamin D:

The fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea.

He felt the hot tears welling up behind his eyelids as he recalled the words and Linda's voice as she repeated them. And then the reading lessons: The tot is in the pot, the cat is on the mat; and the Elementary Instructions for Beta Workers in the Embryo Store. And long evenings by the fire or, in summertime, on the roof of the little house, when she told him those stories about the Other Place, outside the Reservation: that beautiful, beautiful Other Place, whose memory, as of a heaven, a paradise of goodness and loveliness, he still kept whole and intact, undefiled by contact with the reality of this real London, these actual civilized men and women.

A sudden noise of shrill voices made him open his eyes and, after hastily brushing away the tears, look round. What seemed an interminable stream of identical eight-year-old male twins was pouring into the room. Twin after twin, twin after twin, they came—a nightmare. Their faces, their repeated face—for there was only one between the lot of them—puggishly stared, all nostrils and pale goggling eyes. Their uniform was khaki. All their mouths hung open. Squealing and chattering they entered. In a moment, it seemed, the ward was maggoty with them. They swarmed between the beds, clambered over, crawled under, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients.

Linda astonished and rather alarmed them. A group stood clustered at the foot of her bed, staring with the frightened and stupid curiosity of animals suddenly confronted by the unknown.

“Oh, look, look!” They spoke in low, scared voices. “Whatever is the matter with her? Why is she so fat?”

They had never seen a face like hers before—had never seen a face that was not youthful and taut-skinned, a body that had ceased to be slim and upright. All these moribund sexagenarians had the appearance of childish girls. At forty-four, Linda seemed, by contrast, a monster of flaccid and distorted senility.

“Isn't she awful?” came the whispered comments. “Look at her teeth!”

Suddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between John's chair and the wall, and began peering into Linda's sleeping face.

“I say…” he began; but the sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. The Savage had seized him by the collar, lifted him clear over the chair and, with a smart box on the ears, sent him howling away.

His yells brought the Head Nurse hurrying to the rescue.

“What have you been doing to him?” she demanded fiercely. “I won't have you striking the children.”

“Well then, keep them away from this bed.” The Savage's voice was trembling with indignation. “What are these filthy little brats doing here at all? It's disgraceful!”

“Disgraceful? But what do you mean? They're being death-conditioned. And I tell you,” she warned him truculently, “if I have any more of your interference with their conditioning, I'll send for the porters and have you thrown out.”

The Savage rose to his feet and took a couple of steps towards her. His movements and the expression on his face were so menacing that the nurse fell back in terror. With a great effort he checked himself and, without speaking, turned away and sat down again by the bed.

Reassured, but with a dignity that was a trifle shrill and uncertain, “I've warned you,” said the nurse, “so mind.” Still, she led the too inquisitive twins away and made them join in the game of hunt-the-zipper, which had been organized by one of her colleagues at the other end of the room.

“Run along now and have your cup of caffeine solution, dear,” she said to the other nurse. The exercise of authority restored her confidence, made her feel better. “Now children!” she called.

Linda had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. Sitting beside her, the Savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before. “A, B, C, vitamin D,” he repeated to himself, as though the words were a spell that would restore the dead past to life. But the spell was ineffective. Obstinately the beautiful memories refused to rise; there was only a hateful resurrection of jealousies and uglinesses and miseries. Popé with the blood trickling down from his cut shoulder; and Linda hideously asleep, and the flies buzzing round the spilt mescal on the floor beside the bed; and the boys calling those names as she passed….Ah, no, no! He shut his eyes, he shook his head in strenuous denial of these memories. “A, B, C, vitamin D…” He tried to think of those times when he sat on her knees and she put her arms about him and sang, over and over again, rocking him, rocking him to sleep. “A, B, C, vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D…”

The Super-Vox-Wurlitzeriana had risen to a sobbing crescendo; and suddenly the verbena gave place, in the scent-circulating system, to an intense patchouli. Linda stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds bewilderly at the Semi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled—a smile of childish ecstasy.

“Popé!” she murmured, and closed her eyes. “Oh, I do so like it, I do…” She sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows.

“But, Linda!” The Savage spoke imploringly, “Don't you know me?” He had tried so hard, had done his very best; why wouldn't she allow him to forget? He squeezed her limp hand almost with violence, as though he would force her to come back from this dream of ignoble pleasures, from these base and hateful memories—back into the present, back into reality: the appalling present, the awful reality—but sublime, but significant, but desperately important precisely because of the imminence of that which made them so fearful. “Don't you know me, Linda?”

He felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. The tears started into his eyes. He bent over her and kissed her.

Her lips moved. “Popé!” she whispered again, and it was as though he had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face.

Anger suddenly boiled up in him. Balked for the second time, the passion of his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a passion of agonized rage.

“But I'm John!” he shouted. “I'm John!” And in his furious misery he actually caught her by the shoulder and shook her.

Linda's eyes fluttered open; she saw him, knew him—“John!”—but situated the real face, the real and violent hands, in an imaginary world—among the inward and private equivalents of patchouli and the Super-Wurlitzer, among the transfigured memories and the strangely transposed sensations that constituted the universe of her dream. She knew him for John, her son, but fancied him an intruder into that paradisal Malpais where she had been spending her soma-holiday with Popé. He was angry because she liked Popé, he was shaking her because Popé was there in the bed—as though there were something wrong, as though all civilized people didn't do the same. “Every one belongs to every…” Her voice suddenly died into an almost inaudible breathless croaking. Her mouth fell open: she made a desperate effort to fill her lungs with air. But it was as though she had forgotten how to breathe. She tried to cry out—but no sound came; only the terror of her staring eyes revealed what she was suffering. Her hands went to her throat, then clawed at the air—the air she could no longer breathe, the air that, for her, had ceased to exist.

The Savage was on his feet, bent over her. “What is it, Linda? What is it?” His voice was imploring; it was as though he were begging to be reassured.

The look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror—with terror and, it seemed to him, reproach. She tried to raise herself in bed, but fell back on to the pillows. Her face was horribly distorted, her lips blue.

The Savage turned and ran up the ward.

“Quick, quick!” he shouted. “Quick!”

Standing in the centre of a ring of zipper-hunting twins, the Head Nurse looked round. The first moment's astonishment gave place almost instantly to disapproval. “Don't shout! Think of the little ones,” she said, frowning. “You might decondition…But what are you doing?” He had broken through the ring. “Be careful!” A child was yelling.

“Quick, quick!” He caught her by the sleeve, dragged her after him. “Quick! Something's happened. I've killed her.”

By the time they were back at the end of the ward Linda was dead.

The Savage stood for a moment in frozen silence, then fell on his knees beside the bed and, covering his face with his hands, sobbed uncontrollably.

The nurse stood irresolute, looking now at the kneeling figure by the bed (the scandalous exhibition!) and now (poor children!) at the twins who had stopped their hunting of the zipper and were staring from the other end of the ward, staring with all their eyes and nostrils at the shocking scene that was being enacted round Bed 20. Should she speak to him? try to bring him back to a sense of decency? remind him of where he was? of what fatal mischief he might do to these poor innocents? Undoing all their wholesome death-conditioning with this disgusting outcry—as though death were something terrible, as though any one mattered as much as all that! It might give them the most disastrous ideas about the subject, might upset them into reacting in the entirely wrong, the utterly anti-social way.

She stepped forward, she touched him on the shoulder. “Can't you behave?” she said in a low, angry voice. But, looking around, she saw that half a dozen twins were already on their feet and advancing down the ward. The circle was disintegrating. In another moment…No, the risk was too great; the whole Group might be put back six or seven months in its conditioning. She hurried back towards her menaced charges.

“Now, who wants a chocolate éclair?” she asked in a loud, cheerful tone.

“Me!” yelled the entire Bokanovsky Group in chorus. Bed 20 was completely forgotten.

“Oh, God, God, God…” the Savage kept repeating to himself. In the chaos of grief and remorse that filled his mind it was the one articulate word. “God!” he whispered it aloud. “God…”

“Whatever is he saying?” said a voice, very near, distinct and shrill through the warblings of the Super-Wurlitzer.

The Savage violently started and, uncovering his face, looked round. Five khaki twins, each with the stump of a long éclair in his right hand, and their identical faces variously smeared with liquid chocolate, were standing in a row, puggily goggling at him.

They met his eyes and simultaneously grinned. One of them pointed with his éclair butt.

“Is she dead?” he asked.

The Savage stared at them for a moment in silence. Then in silence he rose to his feet, in silence slowly walked towards the door.

“Is she dead?” repeated the inquisitive twin trotting at his side.

The Savage looked down at him and still without speaking pushed him away. The twin fell on the floor and at once began to howl. The Savage did not even look round.

The menial staff of the Park Lane Hospital for the Dying consisted of one hundred-and sixty-two Deltas divided into two Bokanovsky Groups of eighty-four red-headed female and seventy-eight dark dolichocephalic male twins, respectively. At six, when their working day was over, the two Groups assembled in the vestibule of the Hospital and were served by the Deputy Sub-Bursar with their soma ration.

From the lift the Savage stepped out into the midst of them. But his mind was elsewhere—with death, with his grief, and his remorse; mechanicaly, without consciousness of what he was doing, he began to shoulder his way through the crowd.

“Who are you pushing? Where do you think you're going?”

High, low, from a multitude of separate throats, only two voices squeaked or growled. Repeated indefinitely, as though by a train of mirrors, two faces, one a hairless and freckled moon haloed in orange, the other a thin, beaked bird-mask, stubbly with two days' beard, turned angrily towards him. Their words and, in his ribs, the sharp nudging of elbows, broke through his unawareness. He woke once more to external reality, looked round him, knew what he saw—knew it, with a sinking sense of horror and disgust, for the recurrent delirium of his days and nights, the nightmare of swarming indistinguishable sameness. Twins, twins….Like maggots they had swarmed defilingly over the mystery of Linda's death. Maggots again, but larger, full grown, they now crawled across his grief and his repentance. He halted and, with bewildered and horrified eyes, stared round him at the khaki mob, in the midst of which, overtopping it by a full head, he stood. “How many goodly creatures are there here!” The singing words mocked him derisively. “How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world…”

“Soma distribution!” shouted a loud voice. “In good order, please. Hurry up there.”

A door had been opened, a table and chair carried into the vestibule. The voice was that of a jaunty young Alpha, who had entered carrying a black iron cash-box. A murmur of satisfaction went up from the expectant twins. They forgot all about the Savage. Their attention was now focused on the black cash-box, which the young man had placed on the table, and was now in process of unlocking. The lid was lifted.

“Oo-oh!” said all the hundred and sixty-two simultaneously, as though they were looking at fireworks.

The young man took out a handful of tiny pill-boxes. “Now,” he said peremptorily, “step forward, please. One at a time, and no shoving.”

One at a time, with no shoving, the twins stepped forward. First two males, then a female, then another male, then three females, then…

The Savage stood looking on. “O brave new world, O brave new world…” In his mind the singing words seemed to change their tone. They had mocked him through his misery and remorse, mocked him with how hideous a note of cynical derision! Fiendishly laughing, they had insisted on the low squalor, the nauseous ugliness of the nightmare. Now, suddenly, they trumpeted a call to arms. “O brave new world!” Miranda was proclaiming the possibility of loveliness, the possibility of transforming even the nightmare into something fine and noble. “O brave new world!” It was a challenge, a command.

“No shoving there now!” shouted the Deputy Sub-Bursar in a fury. He slammed down he lid of his cash-box. “I shall stop the distribution unless I have good behaviour.”

The Deltas muttered, jostled one another a little, and then were still. The threat had been effective. Deprivation of soma—appalling thought!

“That's better,” said the young man, and re-opened his cash-box.

Linda had been a slave, Linda had died; others should live in freedom, and the world be made beautiful. A reparation, a duty. And suddenly it was luminously clear to the Savage what he must do; it was as though a shutter had been opened, a curtain drawn back.

“Now,” said the Deputy Sub-Bursar.

Another khaki female stepped forward.

“Stop!” called the Savage in a loud and ringing voice. “Stop!”

He pushed his way to the table; the Deltas stared at him with astonishment.

“Ford!” said the Deputy Sub-Bursar, below his breath. “It's the Savage.” He felt scared.

“Listen, I beg of you,” cried the Savage earnestly. “Lend me your ears…” He had never spoken in public before, and found it very difficult to express what he wanted to say. “Don't take that horrible stuff. It's poison, it's poison.”

“I say, Mr. Savage,” said the Deputy Sub-Bursar, smiling propitiatingly. “Would you mind letting me…”

“Poison to soul as well as body.”

“Yes, but let me get on with my distribution, won't you? There's a good fellow.” With the cautious tenderness of one who strokes a notoriously vicious animal, he patted the Savage's arm. “Just let me…”

“Never!” cried the Savage.

“But look here, old man…”

“Throw it all away, that horrible poison.”

The words “Throw it all away” pierced through the enfolding layers of incomprehension to the quick of the Delta's consciousness. An angry murmur went up from the crowd.

“I come to bring you freedom,” said the Savage, turning back towards the twins. “I come…”

The Deputy Sub-Bursar heard no more; he had slipped out of the vestibule and was looking up a number in the telephone book.




“Not in his own rooms,” Bernard summed up. “Not in mine, not in yours. Not at the Aphroditaeum; not at the Centre or the College. Where can he have got to?”

Helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. They had come back from their work expecting to find the Savage waiting for them at one or other of the usual meeting-places, and there was no sign of the fellow. Which was annoying, as they had meant to nip across to Biarritz in Helmholtz's four-seater sporticopter. They'd be late for dinner if he didn't come soon.

“We'll give him five more minutes,” said Helmholtz. “If he doesn't turn up by then, we'll…”

The ringing of the telephone bell interrupted him. He picked up the receiver. “Hullo. Speaking.” Then, after a long interval of listening, “Ford in Flivver!” he swore. “I'll come at once.”

“What is it?” Bernard asked.

“A fellow I know at the Park Lane Hospital,” said Helmholtz. “The Savage is there. Seems to have gone mad. Anyhow, it's urgent. Will you come with me?”

Together they hurried along the corridor to the lifts.




“But do you like being slaves?” the Savage was saying as they entered the Hospital. His face was flushed, his eyes bright with ardour and indignation. “Do you like being babies? Yes, babies. Mewling and puking,” he added, exasperated by their bestial stupidity into throwing insults at those he had come to save. The insults bounced off their carapace of thick stupidity; they stared at him with a blank expression of dull and sullen resentment in their eyes. “Yes, puking!” he fairly shouted. Grief and remorse, compassion and duty—all were forgotten now and, as it were, absorbed into an intense overpowering hatred of these less than human monsters. “Don't you want to be free and men? Don't you even understand what manhood and freedom are?” Rage was making him fluent; the words came easily, in a rush. “Don't you?” he repeated, but got no answer to his question. “Very well then,” he went on grimly. “I'll teach you; I'll make you be free whether you want to or not.” And pushing open a window that looked on to the inner court of the Hospital, he began to throw the little pill-boxes of soma tablets in handfuls out into the area.

For a moment the khaki mob was silent, petrified, at the spectacle of this wanton sacrilege, with amazement and horror.

“He's mad,” whispered Bernard, staring with wide open eyes. “They'll kill him. They'll…” A great shout suddenly went up from the mob; a wave of movement drove it menacingly towards the Savage. “Ford help him!” said Bernard, and averted his eyes.

“Ford helps those who help themselves.” And with a laugh, actually a laugh of exultation, Helmholtz Watson pushed his way through the crowd.

“Free, free!” the Savage shouted, and with one hand continued to throw the soma into the area while, with the other, he punched the indistinguishable faces of his assailants. “Free!” And suddenly there was Helmholtz at his side—“Good old Helmholtz!”—also punching—“Men at last!”—and in the interval also throwing the poison out by handfuls through the open window. “Yes, men! men!” and there was no more poison left. He picked up the cash-box and showed them its black emptiness. “You're free!”

Howling, the Deltas charged with a redoubled fury.

Hesitant on the fringes of the battle. “They're done for,” said Bernard and, urged by a sudden impulse, ran forward to help them; then thought better of it and halted; then, ashamed, stepped forward again; then again thought better of it, and was standing in an agony of humiliated indecision—thinking that they might be killed if he didn't help them, and that he might be killed if he did—when (Ford be praised!), goggle-eyed and swine-snouted in their gas-masks, in ran the police.

Bernard dashed to meet them. He waved his arms; and it was action, he was doing something. He shouted “Help!” several times, more and more loudly so as to give himself the illusion of helping. “Help! Help! HELP!”

The policemen pushed him out of the way and got on with their work. Three men with spraying machines buckled to their shoulders pumped thick clouds of soma vapour into the air. Two more were busy round the portable Synthetic Music Box. Carrying water pistols charged with a powerful anaesthetic, four others had pushed their way into the crowd and were methodically laying out, squirt by squirt, the more ferocious of the fighters.

“Quick, quick!” yelled Bernard. “They'll be killed if you don't hurry. They'll…Oh!” Annoyed by his chatter, one of the policemen had given him a shot from his water pistol. Bernard stood for a second or two wambling unsteadily on legs that seemed to have lost their bones, their tendons, their muscles, to have become mere sticks of jelly, and at last not even jelly—water: he tumbled in a heap on the floor.

Suddenly, from out of the Synthetic Music Box a Voice began to speak. The Voice of Reason, the Voice of Good Feeling. The sound-track roll was unwinding itself in Synthetic Anti-Riot Speech Number Two (Medium Strength). Straight from the depths of a non-existent heart, “My friends, my friends!” said the Voice so pathetically, with a note of such infinitely tender reproach that, behind their gas-masks, even the policemen's eyes were momentarily dimmed with tears, “what is the meaning of this? Why aren't you all being happy and good together? Happy and good,” the Voice repeated. “At peace, at peace.” It trembled, sank into a whisper and momentarily expired. “Oh, I do want you to be happy,” it began, with a yearning earnestness. “I do so want you to be good! Please, please be good and…”

Two minutes later the Voice and the soma vapour had produced their effect. In tears, the Deltas were kissing and hugging one another—half a dozen twins at a time in a comprehensive embrace. Even Helmholtz and the Savage were almost crying. A fresh supply of pill-boxes was brought in from the Bursary; a new distribution was hastily made and, to the sound of the Voice's richly affectionate, baritone valedictions, the twins dispersed, blubbering as though their hearts would break. “Good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, Ford keep you! Good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, Ford keep you. Good-bye, my dearest, dearest…”

When the last of the Deltas had gone the policeman switched off the current. The angelic Voice fell silent.

“Will you come quietly?” asked the Sergeant, “or must we anaesthetize?” He pointed his water pistol menacingly.

“Oh, we'll come quietly,” the Savage answered, dabbing alternately a cut lip, a scratched neck, and a bitten left hand.

Still keeping his handkerchief to his bleeding nose Helmholtz nodded in confirmation.

Awake and having recovered the use of his legs, Bernard had chosen this moment to move as inconspicuously as he could towards the door.

“Hi, you there,” called the Sergeant, and a swine-masked policeman hurried across the room and laid a hand on the young man's shoulder.

Bernard turned with an expression of indignant innocence. Escaping? He hadn't dreamed of such a thing. “Though what on earth you want me for,” he said to the Sergeant, “I really can't imagine.”

“You're a friend of the prisoner's, aren't you?”

“Well…” said Bernard, and hesitated. No, he really couldn't deny it. “Why shouldn't I be?” he asked.

“Come on then,” said the Sergeant, and led the way towards the door and the waiting police car.





Chapter Sixteen


The room into which the three were ushered was the Controller's study.

“His fordship will be down in a moment.” The Gamma butler left them to themselves.

Helmholtz laughed aloud.

“It's more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,” he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs. “Cheer up, Bernard,” he added, catching sight of his friend's green unhappy face. But Bernard would not be cheered; without answering, without even looking at Helmholtz, he went and sat down on the most uncomfortable chair in the room, carefully chosen in the obscure hope of somehow deprecating the wrath of the higher powers.

The Savage meanwhile wandered restlessly round the room, peering with a vague superficial inquisitiveness at the books in the shelves, at the sound-track rolls and reading-machine bobbins in their numbered pigeon-holes. On the table under the window lay a massive volume bound in limp black leather-surrogate, and stamped with large golden T's. He picked it up and opened it. MY LIFE AND WORK, BY OUR FORD. The book had been published at Detroit by the Society for the Propagation of Fordian Knowledge. Idly he turned the pages, read a sentence here, a paragraph there, and had just come to the conclusion that the book didn't interest him, when the door opened, and the Resident World Controller for Western Europe walked briskly into the room.

Mustapha Mond shook hands with all three of them; but it was to the Savage that he addressed himself. “So you don't much like civilization, Mr. Savage,” he said.

The Savage looked at him. He had been prepared to lie, to bluster, to remain sullenly unresponsive; but, reassured by the good-humoured intelligence of the Controller's face, he decided to tell the truth, straightforwardly. “No.” He shook his head.

Bernard started and looked horrified. What would the Controller think? To be labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn't like civilization—said it openly and, of all people, to the Controller—it was terrible. “But, John,” he began. A look from Mustapha Mond reduced him to an abject silence.

“Of course,” the Savage went on to admit, “there are some very nice things. All that music in the air, for instance…”

“Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears and sometimes voices.”

The Savage's face lit up with a sudden pleasure. “Have you read it too?” he asked. “I thought nobody knew about that book here, in England.”

“Almost nobody. I'm one of the very few. It's prohibited, you see. But as I make the laws here, I can also break them. With impunity, Mr. Marx,” he added, turning to Bernard. “Which I'm afraid you can't do.”

Bernard sank into a yet more hopeless misery.

“But why is it prohibited?” asked the Savage. In the excitement of meeting a man who had read Shakespeare he had momentarily forgotten everything else.

The Controller shrugged his shoulders. “Because it's old; that's the chief reason. We haven't any use for old things here.”

“Even when they're beautiful?”

“Particularly when they're beautiful. Beauty's attractive, and we don't want people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.”

“But the new ones are so stupid and horrible. Those plays, where there's nothing but helicopters flying about and you feel the people kissing.” He made a grimace. “Goats and monkeys!” Only in Othello's word could he find an adequate vehicle for his contempt and hatred.

“Nice tame animals, anyhow,” the Controller murmured parenthetically.

“Why don't you let them see Othello instead?”

“I've told you; it's old. Besides, they couldn't understand it.”

Yes, that was true. He remembered how Helmholtz had laughed at Romeo and Juliet. “Well then,” he said, after a pause, “something new that's like Othello, and that they could understand.”

“That's what we've all been wanting to write,” said Helmholtz, breaking a long silence.

“And it's what you never will write,” said the Controller. “Because, if it were really like Othello nobody could understand it, however new it might be. And if were new, it couldn't possibly be like Othello.”

“Why not?”

“Yes, why not?” Helmholtz repeated. He too was forgetting the unpleasant realities of the situation. Green with anxiety and apprehension, only Bernard remembered them; the others ignored him. “Why not?”

“Because our world is not the same as Othello's world. You can't make flivvers without steel—and you can't make tragedies without social instability. The world's stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get. They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there's soma. Which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of liberty, Mr. Savage. Liberty!” He laughed. “Expecting Deltas to know what liberty is! And now expecting them to understand Othello! My good boy!”

The Savage was silent for a little. “All the same,” he insisted obstinately, “Othello's good, Othello's better than those feelies.”

“Of course it is,” the Controller agreed. “But that's the price we have to pay for stability. You've got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. We've sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead.”

“But they don't mean anything.”

“They mean themselves; they mean a lot of agreeable sensations to the audience.”

“But they're…they're told by an idiot.”

The Controller laughed. “You're not being very polite to your friend, Mr. Watson. One of our most distinguished Emotional Engineers…”

“But he's right,” said Helmholtz gloomily. “Because it is idiotic. Writing when there's nothing to say…”

“Precisely. But that requires the most enormous ingenuity. You're making flivvers out of the absolute minimum of steel—works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.”

The Savage shook his head. “It all seems to me quite horrible.”

“Of course it does. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.”

“I suppose not,” said the Savage after a silence. “But need it be quite so bad as those twins?” He passed his hand over his eyes as though he were trying to wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of identical midgets at the assembling tables, those queued-up twin-herds at the entrance to the Brentford monorail station, those human maggots swarming round Linda's bed of death, the endlessly repeated face of his assailants. He looked at his bandaged left hand and shuddered. “Horrible!”

“But how useful! I see you don't like our Bokanovsky Groups; but, I assure you, they're the foundation on which everything else is built. They're the gyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its unswerving course.” The deep voice thrillingly vibrated; the gesticulating hand implied all space and the onrush of the irresistible machine. Mustapha Mond's oratory was almost up to synthetic standards.

“I was wondering,” said the Savage, “why you had them at all—seeing that you can get whatever you want out of those bottles. Why don't you make everybody an Alpha Double Plus while you're about it?”

Mustapha Mond laughed. “Because we have no wish to have our throats cut,” he answered. “We believe in happiness and stability. A society of Alphas couldn't fail to be unstable and miserable. Imagine a factory staffed by Alphas—that is to say by separate and unrelated individuals of good heredity and conditioned so as to be capable (within limits) of making a free choice and assuming responsibilities. Imagine it!” he repeated.

The Savage tried to imagine it, not very successfully.

“It's an absurdity. An Alpha-decanted, Alpha-conditioned man would go mad if he had to do Epsilon Semi-Moron work—go mad, or start smashing things up. Alphas can be completely socialized—but only on condition that you make them do Alpha work. Only an Epsilon can be expected to make Epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren't sacrifices; they're the line of least resistance. His conditioning has laid down rails along which he's got to run. He can't help himself; he's foredoomed. Even after decanting, he's still inside a bottle—an invisible bottle of infantile and embryonic fixations. Each one of us, of course,” the Controller meditatively continued, “goes through life inside a bottle. But if we happen to be Alphas, our bottles are, relatively speaking, enormous. We should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space. You cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. It's obvious theoretically. But it has also been proved in actual practice. The result of the Cyprus experiment was convincing.”

“What was that?” asked the Savage.

Mustapha Mond smiled. “Well, you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. It began in A.F. 473. The Controllers had the island of Cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand Alphas. All agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. The result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. The land wasn't properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws were set at naught, orders disobeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. Within six years they were having a first-class civil war. When nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors unanimously petitioned the World Controllers to resume the government of the island. Which they did. And that was the end of the only society of Alphas that the world has ever seen.”

The Savage sighed, profoundly.

“The optimum population,” said Mustapha Mond, “is modelled on the iceberg—eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above.”

“And they're happy below the water line?”

“Happier than above it. Happier than your friend here, for example.” He pointed.

“In spite of that awful work?”

“Awful? They don't find it so. On the contrary, they like it. It's light, it's childishly simple. No strain on the mind or the muscles. Seven and a half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. What more can they ask for? True,” he added, “they might ask for shorter hours. And of course we could give them shorter hours. Technically, it would be perfectly simple to reduce all lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. But would they be any the happier for that? No, they wouldn't. The experiment was tried, more than a century and a half ago. The whole of Ireland was put on to the four-hour day. What was the result? Unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma; that was all. Those three and a half hours of extra leisure were so far from being a source of happiness, that people felt constrained to take a holiday from them. The Inventions Office is stuffed with plans for labour-saving processes. Thousands of them.” Mustapha Mond made a lavish gesture. “And why don't we put them into execution? For the sake of the labourers; it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with excessive leisure. It's the same with agriculture. We could synthesize every morsel of food, if we wanted to. But we don't. We prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. For their own sakes—because it takes longer to get food out of the land than out of a factory. Besides, we have our stability to think of. We don't want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. That's another reason why we're so chary of applying new inventions. Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. Yes, even science.”

Science? The Savage frowned. He knew the word. But what it exactly signified he could not say. Shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had never mentioned science, and from Linda he had only gathered the vaguest hints: science was something you made helicopters with, something that caused you to laugh at the Corn Dances, something that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. He made a desperate effort to take the Controller's meaning.

“Yes,” Mustapha Mond was saying, “that's another item in the cost of stability. It isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also science. Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.”

“What?” said Helmholtz, in astonishment. “But we're always saying that science is everything. It's a hypnopaedic platitude.”

“Three times a week between thirteen and seventeen,” put in Bernard.

“And all the science propaganda we do at the College…”

“Yes; but what sort of science?” asked Mustapha Mond sarcastically. “You've had no scientific training, so you can't judge. I was a pretty good physicist in my time. Too good—good enough to realize that all our science is just a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody's allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn't be added to except by special permission from the head cook. I'm the head cook now. But I was an inquisitive young scullion once. I started doing a bit of cooking on my own. Unorthodox cooking, illicit cooking. A bit of real science, in fact.” He was silent.

“What happened?” asked Helmholtz Watson.

The Controller sighed. “Very nearly what's going to happen to you young men. I was on the point of being sent to an island.”

The words galvanized Bernard into a violent and unseemly activity. “Send me to an island?” He jumped up, ran across the room, and stood gesticulating in front of the Controller. “You can't send me. I haven't done anything. It was the others. I swear it was the others.” He pointed accusingly to Helmholtz and the Savage. “Oh, please don't send me to Iceland. I promise I'll do what I ought to do. Give me another chance. Please give me another chance.” The tears began to flow. “I tell you, it's their fault,” he sobbed. “And not to Iceland. Oh please, your fordship, please…” And in a paroxysm of abjection he threw himself on his knees before the Controller. Mustapha Mond tried to make him get up; but Bernard persisted in his grovelling; the stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. In the end the Controller had to ring for his fourth secretary.

“Bring three men,” he ordered, “and take Mr. Marx into a bedroom. Give him a good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave him.”

The fourth secretary went out and returned with three green-uniformed twin footmen. Still shouting and sobbing, Bernard was carried out.

“One would think he was going to have his throat cut,” said the Controller, as the door closed. “Whereas, if he had the smallest sense, he'd understand that his punishment is really a reward. He's being sent to an island. That's to say, he's being sent to a place where he'll meet the most interesting set of men and women to be found anywhere in the world. All the people who, for one reason or another, have got too self-consciously individual to fit into community-life. All the people who aren't satisfied with orthodoxy, who've got independent ideas of their own. Every one, in a word, who's any one. I almost envy you, Mr. Watson.”

Helmholtz laughed. “Then why aren't you on an island yourself?”

“Because, finally, I preferred this,” the Controller answered. “I was given the choice: to be sent to an island, where I could have got on with my pure science, or to be taken on to the Controllers' Council with the prospect of succeeding in due course to an actual Controllership. I chose this and let the science go.” After a little silence, “Sometimes,” he added, “I rather regret the science. Happiness is a hard master—particularly other people's happiness. A much harder master, if one isn't conditioned to accept it unquestioningly, than truth.” He sighed, fell silent again, then continued in a brisker tone, “Well, duty's duty. One can't consult one's own preference. I'm interested in truth, I like science. But truth's a menace, science is a public danger. As dangerous as it's been beneficent. It has given us the stablest equilibrium in history. China's was hopelessly insecure by comparison; even the primitive matriarchies weren't steadier than we are. Thanks, I repeat, to science. But we can't allow science to undo its own good work. That's why we so carefully limit the scope of its researches—that's why I almost got sent to an island. We don't allow it to deal with any but the most immediate problems of the moment. All other enquiries are most sedulously discouraged. It's curious,” he went on after a little pause, “to read what people in the time of Our Ford used to write about scientific progress. They seemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely, regardless of everything else. Knowledge was the highest good, truth the supreme value; all the rest was secondary and subordinate. True, ideas were beginning to change even then. Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift. Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can't. And, of course, whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. Still, in spite of everything, unrestricted scientific research was still permitted. People still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they were the sovereign goods. Right up to the time of the Nine Years' War. That made them change their tune all right. What's the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you? That was when science first began to be controlled—after the Nine Years' War. People were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. Anything for a quiet life. We've gone on controlling ever since. It hasn't been very good for truth, of course. But it's been very good for happiness. One can't have something for nothing. Happiness has got to be paid for. You're paying for it, Mr. Watson—paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. I was too much interested in truth; I paid too.”

“But you didn't go to an island,” said the Savage, breaking a long silence.

The Controller smiled. “That's how I paid. By choosing to serve happiness. Other people's—not mine. It's lucky,” he added, after a pause, “that there are such a lot of islands in the world. I don't know what we should do without them. Put you all in the lethal chamber, I suppose. By the way, Mr. Watson, would you like a tropical climate? The Marquesas, for example; or Samoa? Or something rather more bracing?”

Helmholtz rose from his pneumatic chair. “I should like a thoroughly bad climate,” he answered. “I believe one would write better if the climate were bad. If there were a lot of wind and storms, for example…”

The Controller nodded his approbation. “I like your spirit, Mr. Watson. I like it very much indeed. As much as I officially disapprove of it.” He smiled. “What about the Falkland Islands?”

“Yes, I think that will do,” Helmholtz answered. “And now, if you don't mind, I'll go and see how poor Bernard's getting on.”





Chapter Seventeen


Art, science—you seem to have paid a fairly high price for your happiness,” said the Savage, when they were alone. “Anything else?”

“Well, religion, of course,” replied the Controller. “There used to be something called God—before the Nine Years' War. But I was forgetting; you know all about God, I suppose.”

“Well…” The Savage hesitated. He would have liked to say something about solitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the precipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death. He would have liked to speak; but there were no words. Not even in Shakespeare.

The Controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the bookshelves. The heavy door swung open. Rummaging in the darkness within, “It's a subject,” he said, “that has always had a great interest for me.” He pulled out a thick black volume. “You've never read this, for example.”

The Savage took it. “The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments,” he read aloud from the title-page.

“Nor this.” It was a small book and had lost its cover.

“The Imitation of Christ.”

“Nor this.” He handed out another volume.

“The Varieties of Religious Experience. By William James.”

“And I've got plenty more,” Mustapha Mond continued, resuming his seat. “A whole collection of pornographic old books. God in the safe and Ford on the shelves.” He pointed with a laugh to his avowed library—to the shelves of books, the racks full of reading-machine bobbins and sound-track rolls.

“But if you know about God, why don't you tell them?” asked the Savage indignantly. “Why don't you give them these books about God?”

“For the same reason as we don't give them Othello: they're old; they're about God hundreds of years ago. Not about God now.”

“But God doesn't change.”

“Men do, though.”

“What difference does that make?”

“All the difference in the world,” said Mustapha Mond. He got up again and walked to the safe. “There was a man called Cardinal Newman,” he said. “A cardinal,” he exclaimed parenthetically, “was a kind of Arch-Community-Songster.”

“‘I, Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal.’ I've read about them in Shakespeare.”

“Of course you have. Well, as I was saying, there was a man called Cardinal Newman. Ah, here's the book.” He pulled it out. “And while I'm about it I'll take this one too. It's by a man called Maine de Biran. He was a philosopher, if you know what that was.”

“A man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth,” said the Savage promptly.

“Quite so. I'll read you one of the things he did dream of in a moment. Meanwhile, listen to what this old Arch-Community-Songster said.” He opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read. “‘We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters. We are God's property. Is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? Is it any happiness or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? It may be thought so by the young and prosperous. These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way—to depend on no one—to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. But as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that independence was not made for man—that it is an unnatural state—will do for a while, but will not carry us on safely to the end…’” Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. “Take this, for example,” he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: “‘A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charm has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false—a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.’” Mustapha Mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. “One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn't dream about was this” (he waved his hand), “us, the modern world. ‘You can only be independent of God while you've got youth and prosperity; independence won't take you safely to the end.’ Well, we've now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows? Evidently, that we can be independent of God. ‘The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.’ But there aren't any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social order?”

“Then you think there is no God?”

“No, I think there quite probably is one.”

“Then why…?”

Mustapha Mond checked him. “But he manifests himself in different ways to different men. In pre-modern times he manifested himself as the being that's described in these books. Now…”

“How does he manifest himself now?” asked the Savage.

“Well, he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren't there at all.”

“That's your fault.”

“Call it the fault of civilization. God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make your choice. Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness. That's why I have to keep these books locked up in the safe. They're smut. People would be shocked if…”

The Savage interrupted him. “But isn't it natural to feel there's a God?”

“You might as well ask if it's natural to do up one's trousers with zippers,” said the Controller sarcastically. “You remind me of another of those old fellows called Bradley. He defined philosophy as the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct. As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons—that's philosophy. People believe in God because they've been conditioned to believe in God.”

“But all the same,” insisted the Savage, “it is natural to believe in God when you're alone—quite alone, in the night, thinking about death…”

“But people never are alone now,” said Mustapha Mond. “We make them hate solitude; and we arrange their lives so that it's almost impossible for them ever to have it.”

The Savage nodded gloomily. At Malpais he had suffered because they had shut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo, in civilized London he was suffering because he could never escape from those communal activities, never be quietly alone.

“Do you remember that bit in King Lear?” said the Savage at last. “‘The gods are just and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us; the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes,’ and Edmund answers—you remember, he's wounded, he's dying—‘Thou hast spoken right; 'tis true. The wheel is come full circle; I am here.’ What about that now? Doesn't there seem to be a God managing things, punishing, rewarding?”

“Well, does there?” questioned the Controller in his turn. “You can indulge in any number of pleasant vices with a freemartin and run no risks of having your eyes put out by your son's mistress. ‘The wheel is come full circle; I am here.’ But where would Edmund be nowadays? Sitting in a pneumatic chair, with his arm round a girl's waist, sucking away at his sex-hormone chewing-gum and looking at the feelies. The gods are just. No doubt. But their code of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize society; Providence takes its cue from men.”

“Are you sure?” asked the Savage. “Are you quite sure that the Edmund in that pneumatic chair hasn't been just as heavily punished as the Edmund who's wounded and bleeding to death? The gods are just. Haven't they used his pleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him?”

“Degrade him from what position? As a happy, hard-working, goods-consuming citizen he's perfect. Of course, if you choose some other standard than ours, then perhaps you might say he was degraded. But you've got to stick to one set of postulates. You can't play Electro-magnetic Golf according to the rules of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy.”

“But value dwells not in particular will,” said the Savage. “It holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein 'tis precious of itself as in the prizer.”

“Come, come,” protested Mustapha Mond, “that's going rather far, isn't it?”

“If you allowed yourselves to think of God, you wouldn't allow yourselves to be degraded by pleasant vices. You'd have a reason for bearing things patiently, for doing things with courage. I've seen it with the Indians.”

“I'm sure you have,” said Mustapha Mond. “But then we aren't Indians. There isn't any need for a civilized man to bear anything that's seriously unpleasant. And as for doing things—Ford forbid that he should get the idea into his head. It would upset the whole social order if men started doing things on their own.”

“What about self-denial, then? If you had a God, you'd have a reason for self-denial.”

“But industrial civilization is only possible when there's no self-denial. Self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. Otherwise the wheels stop turning.”

“You'd have a reason for chastity!” said the Savage, blushing a little as he spoke the words.

“But chastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and neurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization. You can't have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.”

“But God's the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. If you had a God…”

“My dear young friend,” said Mustapha Mond, “civilization has absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended—there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren't any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. There's no such thing as a divided allegiance; you're so conditioned that you can't help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren't any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears—that's what soma is.”

“But the tears are necessary. Don't you remember what Othello said? ‘If after every tempest came such calms, may the winds blow till they have wakened death.’ There's a story one of the old Indians used to tell us, about the Girl of Mátsaki. The young men who wanted to marry her had to do a morning's hoeing in her garden. It seemed easy; but there were flies and mosquitoes, magic ones. Most of the young men simply couldn't stand the biting and stinging. But the one that could—he got the girl.”

“Charming! But in civilized countries,” said the Controller, “you can have girls without hoeing for them, and there aren't any flies or mosquitoes to sting you. We got rid of them all centuries ago.”

The Savage nodded, frowning. “You got rid of them. Yes, that's just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them…But you don't do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just abolish the slings and arrows. It's too easy.”

He was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. In her room on the thirty-seventh floor, Linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and perfumed caresses—floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the prison of her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. And Tomakin, ex-Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning, Tomakin was still on holiday—on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a beautiful world…

“What you need,” the Savage went on, “is something with tears for a change. Nothing costs enough here.”

(“Twelve and a half million dollars,” Henry Foster had protested when the Savage told him that. “Twelve and a half million—that's what the new Conditioning Centre cost. Not a cent less.”)

“Exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and danger dare, even for an eggshell. Isn't there something in that?” he asked, looking up at Mustapha Mond. “Quite apart from God—though of course God would be a reason for it. Isn't there something in living dangerously?”

“There's a great deal in it,” the Controller replied. “Men and women must have their adrenals stimulated from time to time.”

“What?” questioned the Savage, uncomprehending.

“It's one of the conditions of perfect health. That's why we've made the V.P.S. treatments compulsory.”

“V.P.S.?”

“Violent Passion Surrogate. Regularly once a month. We flood the whole system with adrenin. It's the complete physiological equivalent of fear and rage. All the tonic effects of murdering Desdemona and being murdered by Othello, without any of the inconveniences.”

“But I like the inconveniences.”

“We don't,” said the Controller. “We prefer to do things comfortably.”

“But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”

“In fact,” said Mustapha Mond, “you're claiming the right to be unhappy.”

“All right then,” said the Savage defiantly, “I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.”

“Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen to-morrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.”

There was a long silence.

“I claim them all,” said the Savage at last.

Mustapha Mond shrugged his shoulders. “You're welcome,” he said.





Chapter Eighteen


The door was ajar; they entered.

“John!”

From the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound.

“Is there anything the matter?” Helmholtz called.

There was no answer. The unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; there was silence. Then, with a click, the bathroom door opened and, very pale, the Savage emerged.

“I say,” Helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, “you do look ill, John!”

“Did you eat something that didn't agree with you?” asked Bernard.

The Savage nodded. “I ate civilization.”

“What?”

“It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,” he added, in a lower tone, “I ate my own wickedness.”

“Yes, but what exactly…? I mean, just now you were…”

“Now I am purified,” said the Savage. “I drank some mustard and warm water.”

The others stared at him in astonishment. “Do you mean to say that you were doing it on purpose?” asked Bernard.

“That's how the Indians always purify themselves.” He sat down and, sighing, passed his hand across his forehead. “I shall rest for a few minutes,” he said. “I'm rather tired.”

“Well, I'm not surprised,” said Helmholtz. After a silence, “We've come to say good-bye,” he went on in another tone. “We're off to-morrow morning.”

“Yes, we're off to-morrow,” said Bernard on whose face the Savage remarked a new expression of determined resignation. “And by the way, John,” he continued, leaning forward in his chair and laying a hand on the Savage's knee, “I want to say how sorry I am about everything that happened yesterday.” He blushed. “How ashamed,” he went on, in spite of the unsteadiness of his voice, “how really…”

The Savage cut him short and, taking his hand, affectionately pressed it.

“Helmholtz was wonderful to me,” Bernard resumed, after a little pause. “If it hadn't been for him, I should…”

“Now, now,” Helmholtz protested.

There was a silence. In spite of their sadness—because of it, even; for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another—the three young men were happy.

“I went to see the Controller this morning,” said the Savage at last.

“What for?”

“To ask if I mightn't go to the islands with you.”

“And what did he say?” asked Helmholtz eagerly.

The Savage shook his head. “He wouldn't let me.”

“Why not?”

“He said he wanted to go on with the experiment. But I'm damned,” the Savage added, with sudden fury, “I'm damned if I'll go on being experimented with. Not for all the Controllers in the world. I shall go away to-morrow too.”

“But where?” the others asked in unison.

The Savage shrugged his shoulders. “Anywhere. I don't care. So long as I can be alone.”




From Guildford the down-line followed the Wey valley to Godalming, then, over Milford and Witley, proceeded to Haslemere and on through Petersfield towards Portsmouth. Roughly parallel to it, the up-line passed over Worplesden, Tongham, Puttenham, Elstead and Grayshott. Between the Hog's Back and Hindhead there were points where the two lines were not more than six or seven kilometres apart. The distance was too small for careless flyers—particularly at night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. There had been accidents. Serious ones. It had been decided to deflect the up-line a few kilometres to the west. Between Grayshott and Tongham four abandoned air-lighthouses marked the course of the old Portsmouth-to-London road. The skies above them were silent and deserted. It was over Selborne, Bordon and Farnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared.

The Savage had chosen as his hermitage the old lighthouse which stood on the crest of the hill between Puttenham and Elstead. The building was of ferro-concrete and in excellent condition—almost too comfortable the Savage had thought when he first explored the place, almost too civilizedly luxurious. He pacified his conscience by promising himself a compensatingly harder self-discipline, purifications the more complete and thorough. His first night in the hermitage was, deliberately, a sleepless one. He spent the hours on his knees praying, now to that Heaven from which the guilty Claudius had begged forgiveness, now in Zuñi to Awonawilona, now to Jesus and Pookong, now to his own guardian animal, the eagle. From time to time he stretched out his arms as though he were on the Cross, and held them thus through long minutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and excruciating agony; held them, in voluntary crucifixion, while he repeated, through clenched teeth (the sweat, meanwhile, pouring down his face), “Oh, forgive me! Oh, make me pure! Oh, help me to be good!” again and again, till he was on the point of fainting from the pain.

When morning came, he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the lighthouse; yes, even though there still was glass in most of the windows, even though the view from the platform was so fine. For the very reason why he had chosen the lighthouse had become almost instantly a reason for going somewhere else. He had decided to live there because the view was so beautiful, because, from his vantage point, he seemed to be looking out on to the incarnation of a divine being. But who was he to be pampered with the daily and hourly sight of loveliness? Who was he to be living in the visible presence of God? All he deserved to live in was some filthy sty, some blind hole in the ground. Stiff and still aching after his long night of pain, but for that very reason inwardly reassured, he climbed up to the platform of his tower, he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had regained the right to inhabit. On the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of the Hog's Back, from behind whose eastern extremity rose the towers of the seven skyscrapers which constituted Guildford. Seeing them, the Savage made a grimace; but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time; for at night they twinkled gaily with geometrical constellations, or else, flood-lighted, pointed their luminous fingers (with a gesture whose significance nobody in England but the Savage now understood) solemnly towards the plumbless mysteries of heaven.

In the valley which separated the Hog's Back from the sandy hill on which the lighthouse stood, Puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high, with silos, a poultry farm, and a small vitamin-D factory. On the other side of the lighthouse, towards the South, the ground fell away in long slopes of heather to a chain of ponds.

Beyond them, above the intervening woods, rose the fourteen-story tower of Elstead. Dim in the hazy English air, Hindhead and Selborne invited the eye into a blue romantic distance. But it was not alone the distance that had attracted the Savage to his lighthouse; the near was as seductive as the far. The woods, the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse, the clumps of Scotch firs, the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees, their water lilies, their beds of rushes—these were beautiful and, to an eye accustomed to the aridities of the American desert, astonishing. And then the solitude! Whole days passed during which he never saw a human being. The lighthouse was only a quarter of an hour's flight from the Charing-T Tower; but the hills of Malpais were hardly more deserted than this Surrey heath. The crowds that daily left London left it only to play Electro-magnetic Golf or Tennis. Puttenham possessed no links; the nearest Riemann-surfaces were at Guildford. Flowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. And so, as there was no good reason for coming, nobody came. During the first days the Savage lived alone and undisturbed.

Of the money which, on his first arrival, John had received for his personal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. Before leaving London he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, nails, glue, a few tools, matches (though he intended in due course to make a fire drill), some pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. “No, not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute,” he had insisted. “Even though it is more nourishing.” But when it came to pan-glandular biscuits and vitaminized beef-surrogate, he had not been able to resist the shop-man's persuasion. Looking at the tins now, he bitterly reproached himself for his weakness. Loathesome civilized stuff! He had made up his mind that he would never eat it, even if he were starving. “That'll teach them,” he thought vindictively. It would also teach him.

He counted his money. The little that remained would be enough, he hoped, to tide him over the winter. By next spring, his garden would be producing enough to make him independent of the outside world. Meanwhile, there would always be game. He had seen plenty of rabbits, and there were waterfowl on the ponds. He set to work at once to make a bow and arrows.

There were ash trees near the lighthouse and, for arrow shafts, a whole copse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. He began by felling a young ash, cut out six feet of unbranched stem, stripped off the bark and, paring by paring, shaved away the white wood, as old Mitsima had taught him, until he had a stave of his own height, stiff at the thickened centre, lively and quick at the slender tips. The work gave him an intense pleasure. After those weeks of idleness in London, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to press a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience.

He had almost finished whittling the stave into shape, when he realized with a start that he was singing—singing! It was as though, stumbling upon himself from the outside, he had suddenly caught himself out, taken himself flagrantly at fault. Guiltily he blushed. After all, it was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. It was to escape further contamination by the filth of civilized life; it was to be purified and made good; it was actively to make amends. He realized to his dismay that, absorbed in the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember—poor Linda, and his own murderous unkindness to her, and those loathsome twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death, insulting, with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but the very gods themselves. He had sworn to remember, he had sworn unceasingly to make amends. And here he was, sitting happily over his bow-stave, singing, actually singing….

He went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on the fire.

Half an hour later, three Delta-Minus landworkers from one of the Puttenham Bokanovsky Groups happened to be driving to Elstead and, at the top of the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing Outside the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. His back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. The driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and, with his two companions, stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. One, two, three—they counted the strokes. After the eighth, the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood's edge and there be violently sick. When he had finished, he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve…

“Ford!” whispered the driver. And his twins were of the same opinion.

“Fordey!” they said.

Three days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the reporters came.

Dried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. The Savage was busy on his arrows. Thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. He had made a raid one night on the Puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. It was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. Noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up behind him.

“Good-morning, Mr. Savage,” he said. “I am the representative of The Hourly Radio.”

Startled as though by the bite of a snake, the Savage sprang to his feet, scattering arrows, feathers, glue-pot and brush in all directions.

“I beg your pardon,” said the reporter, with genuine compunction. “I had no intention…” He touched his hat—the aluminum stove-pipe hat in which he carried his wireless receiver and transmitter. “Excuse my not taking it off,” he said. “It's a bit heavy. Well, as I was saying, I am the representative of The Hourly…”

“What do you want?” asked the Savage, scowling. The reporter returned his most ingratiating smile.

“Well, of course, our readers would be profoundly interested…” He put his head on one side, his smile became almost coquettish. “Just a few words from you, Mr. Savage.” And rapidly, with a series of ritual gestures, he uncoiled two wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist; plugged them simultaneously into the sides of his aluminum hat; touched a spring on the crown—and antennae shot up into the air; touched another spring on the peak of the brim—and, like a jack-in-the-box, out jumped a microphone and hung there, quivering, six inches in front of his nose; pulled down a pair of receivers over his ears; pressed a switch on the left side of the hat—and from within came a faint waspy buzzing; turned a knob on the right—and the buzzing was interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and crackle, by hiccoughs and sudden squeaks. “Hullo,” he said to the microphone, “hullo, hullo…” A bell suddenly rang inside his hat. “Is that you, Edzel? Primo Mellon speaking. Yes, I've got hold of him. Mr. Savage will now take the microphone and say a few words. Won't you, Mr. Savage?” He looked up at the Savage with another of those winning smiles of his. “Just tell our readers why you came here. What made you leave London (hold on, Edzel!) so very suddenly. And, of course, that whip.” (The Savage started. How did they know about the whip?) “We're all crazy to know about the whip. And then something about Civilization. You know the sort of stuff. ‘What I think of the Civilized Girl.’ Just a few words, a very few…”

The Savage obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. Five words he uttered and no more—five words, the same as those he had said to Bernard about the Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury. “Háni! Sons éso tse-ná!” And seizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him round (the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed and, with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth-baller, delivered a most prodigious kick.

Eight minutes later, a new edition of The Hourly Radio was on sale in the streets of London. “HOURLY RADIO REPORTER HAS COCCYX KICKED BY MYSTERY SAVAGE,” ran the headlines on the front page. “SENSATION IN SURREY.”

“Sensation even in London,” thought the reporter when, on his return, he read the words. And a very painful sensation, what was more. He sat down gingerly to his luncheon.

Undeterred by that cautionary bruise on their colleague's coccyx, four other reporters, representing the New York Times, the Frankfurt Four-Dimensional Continuum, The Fordian Science Monitor, and The Delta Mirror, called that afternoon at the lighthouse and met with receptions of progressively increasing violence.

From a safe distance and still rubbing his buttocks, “Benighted fool!” shouted the man from The Fordian Science Monitor, “why don't you take soma?”

“Get away!” The Savage shook his fist.

The other retreated a few steps then turned round again. “Evil's an unreality if you take a couple of grammes.”

“Kohakwa iyathtokyai!” The tone was menacingly derisive.

“Pain's a delusion.”

“Oh, is it?” said the Savage and, picking up a thick hazel switch, strode forward.

The man from The Fordian Science Monitor made a dash for his helicopter.

After that the Savage was left for a time in peace. A few helicopters came and hovered inquisitively round the tower. He shot an arrow into the importunately nearest of them. It pierced the aluminium floor of the cabin; there was a shrill yell, and the machine went rocketing up into the air with all the acceleration that its super-charger could give it. The others, in future, kept their distance respectfully. Ignoring their tiresome humming (he likened himself in his imagination to one of the suitors of the Maiden of Mátsaki, unmoved and persistent among the winged vermin), the Savage dug at what was to be his garden. After a time the vermin evidently became bored and flew away; for hours at a stretch the sky above his head was empty and, but for the larks, silent.

The weather was breathlessly hot, there was thunder in the air. He had dug all the morning and was resting, stretched out along the floor. And suddenly the thought of Lenina was a real presence, naked and tangible, saying “Sweet!” and “Put your arms round me!” —in shoes and socks, perfumed. Impudent strumpet! But oh, oh, her arms round his neck, the lifting of her breasts, her mouth! Eternity was in our lips and eyes. Lenina…No, no, no, no! He sprang to his feet and, half naked as he was, ran out of the house. At the edge of the heath stood a clump of hoary juniper bushes. He flung himself against them, he embraced, not the smooth body of his desires, but an armful of green spikes. Sharp, with a thousand points, they pricked him. He tried to think of poor Linda, breathless and dumb, with her clutching hands and the unutterable terror in her eyes. Poor Linda whom he had sworn to remember. But it was still the presence of Lenina that haunted him. Lenina whom he had promised to forget. Even through the stab and sting of the juniper needles, his wincing flesh was aware of her, inescapably real. “Sweet, sweet…And if you wanted me too, why didn't you…”

The whip was hanging on a nail by the door, ready to hand against the arrival of reporters. In a frenzy the Savage ran back to the house, seized it, whirled it. The knotted cords bit into his flesh.

“Strumpet! Strumpet!” he shouted at every blow as though it were Lenina (and how frantically, without knowing it, he wished it were!), white, warm, scented, infamous Lenina that he was flogging thus. “Strumpet!” And then, in a voice of despair, “Oh, Linda, forgive me. Forgive me, God. I'm bad. I'm wicked. I'm…No, no, you strumpet, you strumpet!”

From his carefully constructed hide in the wood three hundred metres away, Darwin Bonaparte, the Feely Corporation's most expert big-game photographer, had watched the whole proceedings. Patience and skill had been rewarded. He had spent three days sitting inside the bole of an artificial oak tree, three nights crawling on his belly through the heather, hiding microphones in gorse bushes, burying wires in the soft grey sand. Seventy-two hours of profound discomfort. But now the great moment had come—the greatest, Darwin Bonaparte had time to reflect, as he moved among his instruments, the greatest since his taking of the famous all-howling stereoscopic feely of the gorillas' wedding. “Splendid,” he said to himself, as the Savage started his astonishing performance. “Splendid!” He kept his telescopic cameras carefully aimed—glued to their moving objective; clapped on a higher power to get a close-up of the frantic and distorted face (admirable!); switched over, for half a minute, to slow motion (an exquisitely comical effect, he promised himself); listened in, meanwhile, to the blows, the groans, the wild and raving words that were being recorded on the sound-track at the edge of his film, tried the effect of a little amplification (yes, that was decidedly better); was delighted to hear, in a momentary lull, the shrill singing of a lark; wished the Savage would turn round so that he could get a good close-up of the blood on his back—and almost instantly (what astonishing luck!) the accommodating fellow did turn round, and he was able to take a perfect close-up.

“Well, that was grand!” he said to himself when it was all over. “Really grand!” He mopped his face. When they had put in the feely effects at the studio, it would be a wonderful film. Almost as good, thought Darwin Bonaparte, as the Sperm Whale's Love-Life—and that, by Ford, was saying a good deal!

Twelve days later The Savage of Surrey had been released and could be seen, heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in Western Europe.

The effect of Darwin Bonaparte's film was immediate and enormous. On the afternoon which followed the evening of its release John's rustic solitude was suddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm of helicopters.

He was digging in his garden—digging, too, in his own mind, laboriously turning up the substance of his thought. Death—and he drove in his spade once, and again, and yet again. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. A convincing thunder rumbled through the words. He lifted another spadeful of earth. Why had Linda died? Why had she been allowed to become gradually less than human and at last…He shuddered. A good kissing carrion. He planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough ground. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport. Thunder again; words that proclaimed themselves true—truer somehow than truth itself. And yet that same Gloucester had called them ever-gentle gods. Besides, thy best of rest is sleep, and that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more. No more than sleep. Sleep. Perchance to dream. His spade struck against a stone; he stooped to pick it up. For in that sleep of death, what dreams…?

A humming overhead had become a roar; and suddenly he was in shadow, there was something between the sun and him. He looked up, startled, from his digging, from his thoughts; looked up in a dazzled bewilderment, his mind still wandering in that other world of truer-than-truth, still focused on the immensities of death and deity; looked up and saw, close above him, the swarm of hovering machines. Like locusts they came, hung poised, descended all around him on the heather. And from out of the bellies of these giant grasshoppers stepped men in white viscose-flannels, women (for the weather was hot) in acetate-shantung pyjamas or velveteen shorts and sleeveless, half-unzippered singlets—one couple from each. In a few minutes there were dozens of them, standing in a wide circle round the lighthouse, staring, laughing, clicking their cameras, throwing (as to an ape) peanuts, packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum, pan-glandular petits beurres. And every moment—for across the Hog's Back the stream of traffic now flowed unceasingly—their numbers increased. As in a nightmare, the dozens became scores, the scores hundreds.

The Savage had retreated towards cover, and now, in the posture of an animal at bay, stood with his back to the wall of the lighthouse, staring from face to face in speechless horror, like a man out of his senses.

From this stupor he was aroused to a more immediate sense of reality by the impact on his cheek of a well-aimed packet of chewing-gum. A shock of startling pain—and he was broad awake, awake and fiercely angry.

“Go away!” he shouted.

The ape had spoken; there was a burst of laughter and hand-clapping. “Good old Savage! Hurrah, hurrah!” And through the babel he heard cries of: “Whip, whip, the whip!”

Acting on the word's suggestion, he seized the bunch of knotted cords from its nail behind the door and shook it at his tormentors.

There was a yell of ironical applause.

Menacingly he advanced towards them. A woman cried out in fear. The line wavered at its most immediately threatened point, then stiffened again, stood firm. The consciousness of being in overwhelming force had given these sightseers a courage which the Savage had not expected of them. Taken aback, he halted and looked round.

“Why don't you leave me alone?” There was an almost plaintive note in his anger.

“Have a few magnesium-salted almonds!” said the man who, if the Savage were to advance, would be the first to be attacked. He held out a packet. “They're really very good, you know,” he added, with a rather nervous smile of propitiation. “And the magnesium salts will help to keep you young.”

The Savage ignored his offer. “What do you want with me?” he asked, turning from one grinning face to another. “What do you want with me?”

“The whip,” answered a hundred voices confusedly. “Do the whipping stunt. Let's see the whipping stunt.”

Then, in unison and on a slow, heavy rhythm, “We—want—the whip,” shouted a group at the end of the line. “We—want—the whip.”

Others at once took up the cry, and the phrase was repeated, parrot-fashion, again and again, with an ever-growing volume of sound, until, by the seventh or eighth reiteration, no other word was being spoken. “We—want—the whip.”

They were all crying together; and, intoxicated by the noise, the unanimity, the sense of rhythmical atonement, they might, it seemed, have gone on for hours—almost indefinitely. But at about the twenty-fifth repetition the proceedings were startlingly interrupted. Yet another helicopter had arrived from across the Hog's Back, hung poised above the crowd, then dropped within a few yards of where the Savage was standing, in the open space between the line of sightseers and the lighthouse. The roar of the air screws momentarily drowned the shouting; then, as the machine touched the ground and the engines were turned off: “We—want—the whip; we—want—the whip,” broke out again in the same loud, insistent monotone.

The door of the helicopter opened, and out stepped, first a fair and ruddy-faced young man, then, in green velveteen shorts, white shirt, and jockey cap, a young woman.

At the sight of the young woman, the Savage started, recoiled, turned pale.

The young woman stood, smiling at him—an uncertain, imploring, almost abject smile. The seconds passed. Her lips moved, she was saying something; but the sound of her voice was covered by the loud reiterated refrain of the sightseers.

“We—want—the whip! We—want—the whip!”

The young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that peach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongruous expression of yearning distress. Her blue eyes seemed to grow larger, brighter; and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. Inaudibly, she spoke again; then, with a quick, impassioned gesture, stretched out her arms towards the Savage, stepped forward.

“We—want—the whip! We—want…”

And all of a sudden they had what they wanted.

“Strumpet!” The Savage had rushed at her like a madman. “Fitchew!” Like a madman, he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords.

Terrified, she had turned to flee, had tripped and fallen in the heather. “Henry, Henry!” she shouted. But her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of harm's way behind the helicopter.

With a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke; there was a convergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. Pain was a fascinating horror.

“Fry, lechery, fry!” Frenzied, the Savage slashed again.

Hungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough.

“Oh, the flesh!” The Savage ground his teeth. This time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. “Kill it, kill it!”

Drawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, impelled by that habit of co-operation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the Savage struck at his own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet.

“Kill it, kill it, kill it…” The Savage went on shouting.

Then suddenly somebody started singing “Orgy-porgy” and, in a moment, they had all caught up the refrain and, singing, had begun to dance. Orgy-porgy, round and round and round, beating one another in six-eight time. Orgy-porgy…

It was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight. Stupefied by soma, and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensuality, the Savage lay sleeping in the heather. The sun was already high when he awoke. He lay for a moment, blinking in owlish incomprehension at the light; then suddenly remembered—everything.

“Oh, my God, my God!” He covered his eyes with his hand.

*

That evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the Hog's Back was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. The description of last night's orgy of atonement had been in all the papers.

“Savage!” called the first arrivals, as they alighted from their machine. “Mr. Savage!”

There was no answer.

The door of the lighthouse was ajar. They pushed it open and walked into a shuttered twilight. Through an archway on the further side of the room they could see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. Just under the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet.

“Mr. Savage!”

Slowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. South-south-west, south, south-east, east….
