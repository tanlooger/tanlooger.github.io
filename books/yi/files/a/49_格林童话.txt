青蛙王子


在愿望还能变成现实的古代，有一个国王，他的几个女儿一个个都很漂亮。国王的幼女尤其美丽，见多识广的太阳每次照着她的面庞，也感到惊奇异常。王宫附近有一座幽暗的大森林，森林里一株老菩提树下面有一口井。炎热的白天，公主常到森林里去，坐在清凉的水井旁边，觉得无聊时，就把一只金球抛到天上，再接住它，这金球是她心爱的玩具。

有一次，公主的金球没有落在她高高举起的小手上，而是掉到了旁边的地上，然后滚到了水井里。公主眼睁睁地看着球掉下去不见了，水井很深，看不见底。公主哭了，哭声越来越大。就在她伤心哭泣的时候，有人问她：“出什么事了，公主？你这样难过，石头也会伤心的。”她扭头看声音传来的地方，只见一只青蛙从井里伸出又大又丑的脑袋。“哎呀，是你呀，划水的老家伙，”她说，“我哭我的金球，它掉到水里去了。”

“安静点儿，别哭。”青蛙回答说，“我有办法，要是我把你的玩具捞上来，你给我什么？”

“你想要什么都行，亲爱的青蛙，”她说，“我的衣服、我的珍珠和宝石，还有我戴的金冠。”

青蛙回答：“你的衣服、你的珍珠和宝石、你的金冠，我都不要。但是，如果你能喜欢我，要我做你的伙伴，和你一起玩耍，让我坐在你的餐桌上，坐在你身边吃你小金盘里的东西，喝你酒杯里的酒，在你的床上睡觉——你要是答应我这些，我就下去给你把金球拿上来。”

“好的，”她说，“只要你把金球给我拿上来，你要求什么我都答应。”她心里想：“这只傻乎乎的青蛙胡说什么呀，它和它的同类一起坐在水里呱呱乱叫，怎么能做人的伙伴呢？”

青蛙得到了许诺，脑袋伸进水里，沉下去一会儿，又游上来，嘴里噙着金球。它把球丢在草地上。公主又见到她心爱的玩具，高兴极了，捡起来就跑。“等一等，等一等，”青蛙叫喊着，“带上我，我跑不了你那么快。”它在公主后面拼命“呱呱！呱呱！”地叫，有什么用！她不听它叫，跑回家里，很快就把可怜的青蛙忘了，青蛙只得再跳回井里。

第二天，当公主同国王和大臣们在餐桌旁坐下，用她的小金盘吃饭的时候，大理石台阶上传来什么东西爬上来的啪嗒啪嗒的响声，它爬到了上面，一边敲门一边大喊大叫：“公主啊，小公主，快给我开门！”公主跑去看是谁在门外面，一开门，青蛙正蹲在门口。她赶紧关门，回到餐桌旁坐下，心里很害怕。国王看她心跳得很厉害，便说：“我的孩子，你害怕什么？门外有个巨人要把你抓走吗？”

“不，”公主回答，“门外没有巨人，是一只可恶的青蛙。”

“青蛙找你干什么？”

“亲爱的爸爸，昨天我在森林里坐在水井边玩，我的金球掉井里了。青蛙看我哭得厉害，就把球给我拿上来，因为它要求非得这样，我就答应了它做我的伙伴。但没想到它真能从井里跳出来。现在它就在门口，要进来找我。”

这时，外面再次传来敲门声，青蛙大声叫道：





公主啊，小公主，

请你给我开门。

你难道忘记昨天，

清凉的井水旁边，

向我许下的诺言？

公主啊，小公主，

请你给我开开门。





国王听了说道：“你答应人家什么，就得照办。去开门吧。”公主只好去开门。青蛙跳进来，一直跟随着她来到椅子旁，它蹲在地上喊：“抱我上去！”公主犹犹豫豫，最后还是国王下令她才把它抱了上去。青蛙登上椅子，又要上桌子。到了桌子上，它说：“把你的金盘子往我这边挪点，我们一起吃。”公主虽然照它说的做了，但谁都看得出她很不情愿。青蛙吃得津津有味，可是公主几乎一口也咽不下去。青蛙最后又说：“我吃饱了，也累了，把我抱到你的卧室，铺好你的丝绸小床，我们一起躺下睡觉。”

公主哭开了，她怕冰凉的青蛙，不敢碰它，现在它却要上她那漂亮干净的小床睡觉。可是国王生气了，说：“在你困难时帮助过你的人，你过后不应该瞧不起他。”于是公主便用两根手指夹住青蛙，提起来把它放在墙角。她上床了，青蛙爬过去说：“我累了，我要和你一样好好睡一觉。抱我上床，不然，我就告诉你父亲。”公主生气极了，抓起它猛力往墙上摔去：“现在你该安静了，你这讨厌的青蛙！”



它一落地，已不再是青蛙，而是一位王子，长着俊美而友善的眼睛。遵照国王的意愿，他成了公主亲爱的伴侣和丈夫。他对她说，他被一个恶毒的巫婆施了魔法，除了公主，任何人都无法把他从水井里解救出来，明天他们将一起前往他的王国。说完话，他们就睡着了。第二天早晨，太阳唤醒他们的时候，驶来了一辆八匹白马拉的马车，马头都插着洁白的鸵鸟羽毛，马身上挂着金链，车后立着一个人，这就是王子的侍从——忠诚的亨利。他的主人被巫婆变成一只青蛙后，忠诚的亨利非常痛苦忧伤，他让人在他胸部围上三道铁箍，以防心脏因痛苦悲伤而破裂。这辆马车来接王子回到他自己的王国。忠诚的亨利扶王子、公主上车，自己站在车后，为王子获救而欣喜万分。走了一程，王子听见他背后咔嚓一声响，好像什么东西折断了。他回过头去，大声说：“亨利，马车坏了？”

亨利回答说：“不，主人，马车没坏，是我心口上的铁箍断了，当你被困在井里，当你被变成青蛙，我的心痛苦万分。”路上又有两次响起咔嚓声，王子总以为是马车坏了，其实是忠诚的亨利心口的铁箍崩裂了，因为他的主人已经得救，并且获得了幸福。





玛丽亚的孩子


有一个樵夫和他的妻子住在一座大森林前面，他们只有一个三岁的女儿。他们穷得连每天要吃的面包也没有了，不知道怎样才能养活自己的孩子。一天早晨，樵夫忧心忡忡地走出家门，到森林里干活。他正砍柴的时候，眼前忽然出现一个高大美丽的女子，头戴星光灿烂的冠冕，她对他说：“我是圣母玛丽亚，耶稣基督的母亲。你这么贫苦，把孩子给我吧，我要带走她，做她的母亲，照料她。”樵夫遵命，把孩子领来交给圣母玛丽亚，圣母玛丽亚就带着她到天上去了。在天堂里，小姑娘生活得很幸福，她吃糖面包，喝甜牛奶，穿的衣服是金子做的，小天使们和她一起玩。她长到了十四岁，有一天，圣母玛丽亚把她叫到跟前，对她说：“好孩子，我要做一次长途旅行，你要保管好开天堂十三扇门的钥匙。其中的十二扇门你都可以打开，进去看看里面的美妙景象，而唯独第十三扇门你不能打开！要当心，不要去开那扇门，不然就会大难临头。”小姑娘答应听她的话。圣母玛丽亚走后，她就开始看天国的住房：每天打开一处住所的房门，一直到十二所住房全看遍了。每一所住房里都坐着一个使徒，沐浴在一片灿烂的光辉里。看到所有这一切神奇美妙的景象后，小姑娘很高兴，一直陪伴她的小天使们也同她一样高兴。现在只剩下不许打开的那扇门了。她非常想知道那里面究竟藏着什么东西，她对小天使们说：“我不想把这扇门完全打开，也不进去，我只想把门开个小缝，往里面看上一眼。”

“啊，别开，别开！”小天使们说，“那是罪孽，圣母玛丽亚禁止你开这扇门，你开了会大难临头的。”小姑娘默不作声，她心中的好奇之火非但未熄灭，而且在啮噬着她的心，使她不得安宁。有一次，小天使们都到外面去了，她心想：“现在就我一个人在这里，可以进去看看，我进去看了谁也不会知道的。”她找出那把钥匙，一拿到手上，就把钥匙插进锁眼里，插进去后就转动钥匙。门一下子敞开，她看见烈火灵辉中坐着“三位一体”[1]。她站了一会儿，惊讶地打量着一切，随后用一根手指稍微接触一下火光，手指立刻变成了金色。她顿时惊恐万分，使劲关上门，拔腿就跑。她怎么也无法减轻心中的恐惧，一颗心怦怦直跳；无论她怎么擦洗，都无法去除手指上的黄金。

没过多久，圣母玛丽亚旅行归来了。她把小姑娘叫来，要她交回天国的钥匙。她递给她那串钥匙，圣母注视着她的眼睛，说：“你也开了第十三扇门了？”

“没有。”她回答说。圣母把手放在小姑娘心口上，感到她的心怦怦直跳，知道她违背她的戒律，开了那扇门，于是又问一遍：“你真的没打开过那扇门？”

“没有。”小姑娘再次回答。这时圣母玛丽亚看见她因为触到天火而变成金子的手指，知道她分明有罪过，便第三次问她：“真的没开过？”

“没有。”小姑娘第三次这样回答。

于是圣母玛丽亚说：“你不听我的话，并且还撒谎；你不配继续留在天堂。”

于是姑娘坠入了深沉的睡梦中，一觉醒来，发现自己已经躺在尘世荒野之中。她想喊，喊不出声音；想跑开，但无论向哪个方向跑，总被带刺的树篱拦住，无法穿越过去。她被困在荒野里，她站在一棵空心的古树下，只得把这棵树当作自己的住所。黑夜来临，她爬进树洞里面睡觉，暴风雨天气，她在里面躲避风雨。这是多么悲惨的生活！每当她想起在天堂里的时光，就觉得当时的生活多么美妙，想起天使们和她一同嬉戏，她就伤心痛苦。草根和森林里的野莓是她唯一的食物，还得费力去寻找。秋天，她收集树上掉下的坚果和树叶，把它们搬进树洞。坚果是她冬天的食物。下雪结冰，她就像可怜的小动物一样爬到树叶堆里，免得挨冻。不久她的衣服就破烂不堪，一块块地从身上掉下来。当太阳又温暖地照耀万物时，她爬出树洞，坐在古树前面，长长的头发遮蔽了她整个身子，如同一件长大衣。就这样过了一年又一年，她感受了人世的悲凉和苦难。

春天，树木又披上了新绿。有一天，国王在森林里打猎，追逐一只小鹿，小鹿逃到包围着那一片林中荒野的灌木丛里。国王下马，披荆斩棘，开出一条路。他终于穿过了灌木丛，看见一位美丽绝伦的姑娘坐在树下，一头金发遮住她的全身。国王静静地站着，非常惊讶，把她打量一番，然后问她说：“你是谁？为什么坐在这荒凉的地方？”可是她没有回答，因为她张不开口。国王又说：“你愿意跟我去我的王宫里吗？”她微微点一点头。国王把她抱到马上，骑马带她回家。一到王宫，就让她穿上美丽的衣裳，什么东西都给她，而且给的很多。虽然她说不了话，但她美丽又温柔，国王由衷地爱她，不久便同她结婚了。

大约一年以后，王后生了一个儿子。当天夜里，她独自一人躺在床上，圣母玛丽亚出现在她面前，说：“如果你肯讲实话，承认开了那扇禁止打开的门，我就让你能张开口，还给你说话的能力。如果你不肯悔过，顽固抵赖，我就带走你新生的婴儿。”王后这时能开口说话，她说：“不，我没打开过那扇禁止打开的门。”于是圣母玛丽亚从她怀里抱走了初生的婴儿。第二天早晨，孩子不见了，人们窃窃私语，说王后是吃人的妖精，杀了自己的亲生儿子。这一切她都听到了，但她无法辩白，不过国王非常爱她，不相信这些话。

一年后，王后又生了一个儿子。夜里，圣母玛丽亚又来到宫中找她，说：“如果你肯承认开过那扇禁止打开的门，我就把孩子还给你，让你能开口说话。可是，如果你不悔改，继续否认，我就把这个初生的婴儿也带走。”王后仍然说：“不，我没有开过那扇禁止打开的门。”圣母从她怀里抱走婴儿，带他飞上了天。第二个孩子又失踪了，人们早晨纷纷大声议论，说孩子是被王后吞了，大臣们要求治她的罪。但国王非常爱她，不愿相信有这回事，并且下令要大臣们绝口不提此事，违令者要处以死刑。

又过了一年，王后生了一个漂亮的女儿。圣母玛丽亚第三次夜里出现在她面前，说：“跟我走。”拉着她的手，领她上天堂看她那两个大孩子，他们正在玩地球仪，见了她都笑了。王后非常高兴，圣母玛利亚说：“你的心还那么硬吗？如果你承认开过那扇禁止打开的门，我就把这两个孩子还给你。”可是王后第三次的回答仍然是：“不，我没有开过那扇禁止打开的门。”于是圣母又让她落到尘世，并且带走了她的第三个孩子。

第二天早晨，事情传开了，所有的人们都大声呼喊：“王后是个吃人精，一定要将她判刑！”国王无法再拒绝大臣们的要求，于是对她进行审判。她既不能回答讯问，又不能为自己辩护，便被判处在火刑柱上烧死。木柴堆放好了，她被绑在火刑柱上，四周火焰开始熊熊地燃烧。这时，骄傲的坚冰融化了，悔恨震撼了她的心灵，她心里想道：“要是在临死前还能让我承认开过那扇禁止打开的门，那就好了！”就在这时，她忽然能开口说话了，于是她高声叫喊：“是的，玛丽亚，我开过那扇门！”霎时间，天上降雨浇灭了烈焰，在她的上方，射出一道光，圣母玛丽亚降临，怀里抱着初生的女婴，两个男孩站在她两边。她和蔼地对她说：“谁忏悔和承认自己的罪孽，谁就会得到宽恕。”她把三个孩子交给王后，让她又能开口说话了，并赐予她终生幸福。

忠诚的约翰内斯


从前有一个老国王，得了重病，他想：“我看来好不了了。”便说：“叫忠诚的约翰内斯进来。”忠诚的约翰内斯是他最心爱的侍从，因为他一生对国王忠贞不渝，所以大家都这么叫他。约翰来到床前，国王对他说：“忠诚的约翰内斯，我觉得我快要死了，唯一不放心的是我的儿子，他还年轻，有时遇事缺乏主见。你要答应我，教给他必须知道的一切，当他的养父，否则我死不瞑目。”忠诚的约翰内斯回答说：“我决不离开他，一定忠诚地为他效劳，即使牺牲自己的生命也在所不辞。”老国王说：“那我死也放心了。”接着又说：“我死后你要带他看看这整座宫殿，看宫中所有房间、大厅、金库和金库里的全部珍宝，但是不要让他看长廊尽头的那个房间，因为房间里面藏有金屋公主的塑像，他要是看见她的塑像，会对她产生热烈的爱情，会晕过去，会因她而陷入极大的危险。你要保护他，不要让这种事情发生。”忠诚的约翰内斯听了国王的话，再次把手伸给他，国王不再说话，头往枕头上一靠就去世了。

将老国王安葬之后，忠诚的约翰内斯对年轻的国王讲了他向临终的老国王许下的诺言，他说：“我一定信守诺言，像对老国王一样对你忠诚，即使牺牲自己的生命。”服丧期结束了，忠诚的约翰内斯对年轻的国王说：“现在是你看一看你的遗产的时候了：我要领你看一看你父王的宫殿。”于是他领着年轻的国王上上下下转遍各处，让他看了所有的珍宝财富、豪华宫室，唯独没打开那间收藏着危险的塑像的房间。那塑像安放在一开门就能见到的地方，制作精美绝伦，令人感到那是真人、活人，世上再没有比她更美丽、更可爱的女子了。年轻的国王发现忠诚的约翰内斯总是从一扇门前径直走过，便说：“你为什么从不打开这扇门让我看？”

约翰内斯回答说：“这里面有些东西会吓着你。”

国王答道：“这座宫殿我都看完了，我很想知道里面有什么东西。”说着走过去用力推门。

忠诚的约翰内斯劝阻他说：“你父王临终前我答应过他，不让你看这房间里的东西，因为它会给你和我带来灾难。”

“啊，不！”年轻的国王回答，“我不进去，必遭毁灭，不亲眼见到它，我会日夜不得安宁。你不把门打开，我就不走。”

忠诚的约翰内斯见劝阻无效，便唉声叹气、心情沉重地从一大串钥匙里找出那把钥匙。他一打开门，就抢先跨进房间，想用自己的身体挡住国王的视线，让他看不见那尊塑像。可是有什么用呢？国王踮起脚尖，从他肩膀上方望去。当他瞥见那美艳绝伦、珠光宝气的少女塑像，一下子就晕倒在地上。忠诚的约翰内斯把他抱起来放在床上，满腹忧愁，他想：“大祸临头了，上帝啊，这该怎么办啊？”他给他灌葡萄酒，直至他恢复知觉。国王开口第一句话就是：“啊！那美丽的塑像是谁？”

“是金屋公主。”忠诚的约翰内斯回答说。

国王又说：“即便树上所有的树叶都是舌头，也说不尽我对她的挚爱，为了得到她，我愿付出我的生命。你是我最忠诚的约翰内斯，你必须帮助我。”

忠诚的臣仆想了很久，不知如何是好，因为仅仅要见公主一面，就很不容易。最后，他终于想出个办法，便对国王说：“公主身边的一切，桌子、椅子、盘碗酒杯，所有家用器皿，都是金子做的。你的宝物中有五吨黄金，可以拿出一吨来，让国中的金匠制作成各式各样的器皿用具，各式各样的飞禽走兽、珍稀动物，她一定会喜欢这些物件，我们就带着这些东西去碰一碰运气。”

于是国王召集全国金匠，命令他们日夜赶工，终于制成华美无比的精品。一切装船完毕，忠诚的约翰内斯换上商人的服装，国王同样乔装打扮，让人完全认不出他们。然后他们漂洋过海，航行了很久很久，终于来到金屋公主居住的城市。

忠诚的约翰内斯让国王在船上等他。他说：“说不定我会把金屋公主带来，因此你要把一切收拾得整整齐齐，把黄金器皿陈列起来，把整条船装饰得漂漂亮亮的。”说着，他把各种金器拣一些放在衣兜里，上岸直奔王宫。到了宫中庭院，只见一个美丽的姑娘站在井边，手提两只金桶打水。她提着晶亮晶亮的水要走的时候，一转身，看见一个陌生人，就问他是谁。他回答：“我是商人。”便打开衣兜让她看。她不禁叫起来：“啊，多美的金器啊！”她放下水桶，一件一件地仔细观赏。姑娘说：“我要让公主看看，她非常喜爱金器，会把您的金器全部都买下来的。”她拉着他的手，把他领进宫里，因为她是个侍女。公主见了这些金货，非常高兴，她说：“这些金器做得这么好，我要全都买下来。”但是忠诚的约翰内斯说：“我只是一个富商的仆人，我带到这儿来的珍宝，跟我主人的船上的比起来，算不了什么，他那些都是古往今来最考究、最贵重的金器。”她要他把所有的金器都拿出来，他说：“都搬出来要花好几天时间，东西太多了，要好几个大厅才能陈列得开，您宫里地方不够。”这番话更加激起了公主的好奇心和欲望，她终于说：“带我到船上去吧，我要亲自看看你家主人的珍宝。”

于是忠诚的约翰内斯领着公主向他们那条船走去，心里非常高兴。国王见她本人比那塑像还要美丽得多，乐得一颗心都快蹦出来了。她上了船，国王把她接进舱中；忠诚的约翰内斯留在舵手身边，下令开船离岸，他说：“把所有船帆都升起来，船要疾驶如飞，就像空中的鸟儿一样。”船舱里，国王向公主一件一件展示金器：金碗、金杯、金盆、金钵、黄金制作的飞禽走兽、珍稀动物。看完最后一件金器，她向商人道谢，准备回家，走到船舷，只见船已远离陆地，在大海上扬帆疾驶。“啊，”她失声惊呼，“我上当了，被人诱拐，落入商人手里，不如死了好！”国王握住她的手说：“我不是商人，我是个国王，出身高贵，不亚于你。我之所以设计诱骗你，是因为我太爱你了。当我初次见到你的塑像，我就晕倒在地。”金屋公主听了这话，感到宽慰，对国王渐渐起了爱慕之心，终于欣然同意做他的妻子。

他们在大海上航行，有一天，忠诚的约翰内斯坐在船头奏乐，看见空中飞来三只乌鸦。他便不再弹奏，聚精会神听乌鸦谈话，因为他精通鸟语。一只乌鸦叫道：“哎，他带金屋公主回家了。”

“是的，”第二只乌鸦说，“他还没得到她。”

第三只说：“他得到她了，她在船上，坐在他身边。”

第一只乌鸦又叫起来：“那有什么用！他们上岸时，会有一匹枣红马向他迎面奔来，说不定他要跃上马背，他一骑上马背，这匹马就驮着他奔上天空，他就永远见不到自己的未婚妻了。”

第三只乌鸦说：“那就没办法解救了？”

“啊，有办法，如果有另外一个人迅速骑上去，拔出马鞍上枪套里的火枪，射杀那匹马，年轻的国王就得救了。可是这法子谁知道！如果谁知道这法子，又告诉给国王，谁就会从脚趾头到膝盖变成石头。”

第二只乌鸦说：“我知道的还要多。杀了那匹马，并不等于年轻的国王就得到他的未婚妻了！他们一同走进王宫的时候，那里有一个大盆，里面放着一件做好了的结婚礼服，看上去像是金丝银线织成的，其实只不过是硫黄和沥青做成的，国王一穿上它，就会被烧成灰烬。”

第三只乌鸦说：“那就没办法解救了？”

“啊，办法是有，”第二只乌鸦回答说，“如果有人戴上手套，抓起礼服，把它扔进火里烧掉，年轻的国王就得救了。没用！没用！这法子谁知道！如果谁知道这法子，又告诉给国王，谁就会从膝盖到心脏半个身子都变成石头。”

第三只乌鸦说：“我知道的还要多。烧了结婚礼服，也还不等于年轻的国王就得到他的未婚妻了。婚礼之后，舞会开始，年轻的王后突然倒下，面色煞白，像死了一般，这时得有个男子把她抱起来，从她的右胸脯吸三滴血，再喷出来，否则她就会死掉。但是，如果有人知道这法子又泄漏出去，他从头顶到脚趾头全身就都会变成石头。”

三只乌鸦交谈完就飞走了。忠诚的约翰内斯什么都听明白了，他从此变得沉默寡言，暗自忧伤，因为，如果他不把听到的话告诉给主人，主人将遭到不幸；如果告诉他，自己必将丧命。终于，他还是对自己说：“我要救我的主人，即使为此毁了我自己。”

他们上岸的时候，果然真像乌鸦所说的那样，迎面奔来一匹枣红马。“太好了！”国王说，“就骑它回宫。”说罢就要上马，但忠诚的约翰内斯抢在他前面飞身上马，拔出枪套里的枪，打死了那匹马。那些不满忠诚的约翰内斯的侍从一起大叫起来：“这么漂亮的马竟然给杀了，真可恶！国王还想骑它回宫呢！”但国王说：“安静！让他去吧，他是我最忠诚的约翰内斯，他这么做一定有他的道理，谁知道呢！”

他们进宫，殿堂上有一个大盆，里面放着一件做好了的结婚礼服，外表看上去是金丝银线织成的。年轻的国王径直朝它走去，正要伸手去取，忠诚的约翰内斯推开国王的手，戴上手套，一把抓起礼服扔进火里烧掉了。那些侍从又叫嚷开了：“你们看，他居然把国王的结婚礼服给烧了！”但年轻的国王说：“谁知道这有什么好处！让他去吧，他是我最忠诚的约翰内斯。”

婚礼之后开始跳舞。忠诚的约翰内斯注视着王后的面庞，忽然，她面容苍白，倒在地上，像死人一样。约翰内斯一跃而起，奔上前去，把她抱起来，抱进一间房间，让她躺下。他跪下，从她的右乳房吮吸了三滴血，又喷了出来。她随即又能呼吸，恢复了过来。国王目睹这一幕，他不明白忠诚的约翰内斯为什么这样做，勃然大怒，高声说：“把他关进监牢。”

第二天早晨，忠诚的约翰内斯被判处绞刑，押赴刑场。当他站在绞刑台上将被处决的时候，他说：“要被处死的人都被允许讲一次话，我也有这个权利吗？”

“是的，”国王回答，“也给你这个权利。”

忠诚的约翰内斯说：“判我有罪是不公正的，我一贯对你忠心耿耿。”于是他讲了在海上听到的乌鸦的谈话，以及为了拯救主人，他必须做这一切。国王听了以后，大声喊道：“啊，我最忠诚的约翰内斯，赦免！赦免！快把他带下来。”可是忠诚的约翰内斯说完最后一句话，已经毫无生气，从台上摔下来，变成了石头人。

国王和王后为这件事非常难过。国王说：“啊，他这样忠心耿耿，我竟然恩将仇报！”他派人扶起石像，把它竖立在自己卧室的床边。每当望着这尊石像，他就哭泣说：“啊，我最忠诚的约翰内斯，要是能让你起死回生那该多好啊！”

过了一段时间，王后生了双胞胎，两个小男孩。小王子渐渐长大，他们是王后的开心果。有一次，王后上教堂去了，两个孩子坐在父亲身边玩儿，国王又满怀伤痛地望着石像叹息道：“啊，我最忠诚的约翰内斯，要是能让你起死回生那该多好啊！”

这时石像开口了，它说：“能，你能让我起死回生，只要你肯为此舍弃你最心爱的东西。”

国王大声说：“为了你，我愿舍弃我在世上拥有的一切。”

石像又说：“如果你亲手砍下你的两个孩子的头，把他们的血抹在我的身上，我就能重新获得生命。”

国王一听要他亲手杀死自己最心爱的孩子，惊骇异常，但他想到约翰内斯是为他而死的，便拔剑亲手砍下了两个孩子的头。当他用孩子的血涂抹了石像，石像立刻重获生机，忠诚的约翰内斯变成精神奕奕的活人，健康地站在他面前。他对国王说：“你的真诚应当获得报答。”他接上孩子们的头，用他们的血涂抹伤口，只一刹那，孩子就痊愈了，又活蹦乱跳，继续玩耍，好像什么事情都没有发生似的。国王心里非常高兴，他看见王后回来，让忠诚的约翰内斯和两个孩子躲在一个大柜橱里面。她一进门，国王就对她说：“你在教堂祈祷了吗？”

“祈祷了，”她回答，“可我心里总想着忠诚的约翰内斯，他为了我们，遭遇了这么大的不幸。”

国王说：“亲爱的妻子，我们可以使他重新获得生命，但要以我们的两个幼子为代价，我们必须牺牲他们。”

王后面色惨白，心中惊骇，但是她说：“我们应该这样做，为了报答他伟大的忠诚。”

国王很高兴她的想法和自己一样，他跑去打开柜橱，叫孩子们和忠诚的约翰内斯出来，国王说：“赞美上帝，他得救了，我们也没有失去我们的两个孩子！”并对她讲了事情的经过。从此他们一起过着幸福美满的生活，一直到老。





莴苣姑娘


从前有一个男人和一个女人，他们想要个孩子，可是很久都没有。后来，女人终于怀孕了，也许亲爱的上帝要让她如愿以偿了。他们家后面的房子有一扇小窗，从小窗往外看能看到一座豪华美丽的花园，芳草如茵，盛开着最美丽的花；但是这座一道高墙围着的花园，谁都不敢走进去，因为它属于一个法力广大的女巫，人人都惧怕她。有一天，女人站在那个小窗旁俯望花园，看见一圃非常美丽的莴苣，那么鲜嫩，青翠欲滴，引得她忽然产生想吃莴苣的强烈愿望。这渴望与日俱增，但她知道无法实现，因而日渐消瘦，面容苍白、憔悴。她丈夫吃惊地问道：“你怎么啦，亲爱的？”

“啊，”她回答，“如果我不能吃到我们家后面花园里长的莴苣，我就要死了。”

那个男人很爱她，心想：“无论付出什么代价，我也要给她弄点莴苣来。”他在暮色朦胧中翻过围墙，跳进巫婆的花园，匆匆忙忙拔了一个莴苣，带回来给妻子。她马上拿它做凉菜，吃得一干二净。她觉得莴苣味道好极了，第二天馋得更厉害。丈夫要让她安宁，还得再去一趟花园。于是他又在暮色朦胧的时候爬墙过去，这时，他看见老巫婆就站在自己面前，吓一大跳。

“你胆子不小啊！”她目露凶光，说：“敢做贼到我花园里偷我的莴苣，我得叫你知道我的厉害。”

“啊！”他回答说，“请你宽恕我吧，我实在是迫不得已，我的妻子从窗口看到你的莴苣，她馋得厉害，不让她吃点儿，她真的会死的。”巫婆怒气渐消，对他说：“真是像你所说的那样，我就让你拿莴苣，要多少拿多少。只是我有个条件：你得把你妻子生的孩子给我。我会像妈妈一样照料他，孩子的生活差不了。”那男人心里害怕，一口答应了。他的妻子一分娩，老巫婆就去了，她给孩子取名叫莴苣，把孩子带走了。

莴苣长成了天底下最漂亮的女孩子。她十二岁那年，巫婆把她锁在森林中一座塔楼里。这塔既没有楼梯，也没有门，只塔顶上有一个很小很小的窗户。

巫婆要上塔楼，就往塔下一站，大声喊：





莴苣，莴苣，

放下你的头发，我要上去。





莴苣有一头长长的细如金丝的美丽秀发，她听到巫婆的叫声，就解开辫子，缠绕在一个窗钩子上，把头发放下四米来长，让巫婆爬上去。

几年以后，一位王子骑马路过森林，从塔旁走过的时候，听见有人在唱歌，歌声是那么美妙动人，王子不由驻足倾听。这是莴苣姑娘在孤寂中为了打发时光，扬声歌唱。王子想上去找她，却找不到塔楼的门。这座塔没有门。他只好回家，但这歌声深深地打动了他的心，他天天到森林里去听莴苣姑娘唱歌。一天，他站在一棵树后面，看见一个巫婆走上前去，听见她叫喊：





莴苣，莴苣，

放下你的头发，我要上去。





莴苣姑娘听了，放下发辫，巫婆爬了上去。“既然这是上塔的梯子，我也要碰碰运气。”第二天天快黑的时候，他走近塔，大声喊：





莴苣，莴苣，

放下你的头发，我要上去。





不一会儿，头发垂下来，王子登上了塔。

莴苣姑娘看见一个男人进塔向她走来，起初非常害怕，因为她从来没有见过男人。但王子十分亲切地和她攀谈，向她诉说她的歌声如何使他深受感动，他如何寝食难安，非要亲自见她一面不可，莴苣姑娘的恐惧消失了，他问她愿不愿意嫁给他，她见他年少英俊，心想：“他会比戈特尔老太太还爱我。”便答应了，把自己的手放在他的手里。她说：“我愿意跟你一起走，但是我不知道怎样才能下去。你以后再来，都带一卷丝线吧，我要编个软梯，编好了，我就能下塔了，然后你再扶我上马。”他们约定直到出走之前，他每天晚上都来看她，因为老太婆白天来。这事巫婆丝毫也没有察觉，直到有一天，莴苣姑娘对她说：“请你告诉我，戈特尔太太，这是怎么回事，我觉得把你拉上来比把那位年轻的王子拉上来要费劲得多，他一眨眼就到我身边了。”

“好啊！”巫婆叫嚷起来，“你这个坏孩子，说的什么话！我还以为已经使你与世隔绝了呢！原来你骗了我！”大怒之下，她抓住莴苣姑娘美丽的发辫，在左手腕缠绕几圈，右手抄起一把剪刀，咔嚓几下，剪断了头发，美丽的发辫落在地上。她还狠心地把可怜的莴苣姑娘带到一处荒野，迫使她在那里过着极其艰辛痛苦的生活。

莴苣姑娘被赶走的当天晚上，巫婆把剪下的发辫的一端牢牢系在塔里的窗钩上，王子一喊：





莴苣，莴苣，

放下你的头发，我要上去。





她就往塔下放发辫。王子登上塔发现他心爱的莴苣姑娘不在塔上，只见老巫婆一双恶毒的眼睛死死盯着他。“啊哈，”她讥笑王子，大声说，“你要找你的心上人，但美丽的小鸟儿已经不在窝里，也不歌唱了，猫把她叼走了，我还要挖掉你的两只眼睛，叫你永远休想再看见她！”王子心中痛楚万分，绝望之中跳下高塔。他落在荆棘丛中，虽然保住了性命，双眼却被刺瞎了。他盲目地在森林里流浪，吃的是树根、野莓，终日为失去他最心爱的女子而哭泣悲伤。他在愁苦困顿之中这样流浪了几年，终于来到莴苣姑娘和她生的孪生兄妹一起艰难度日的荒野。他听到有人说话，那声音是那么熟悉，他径直走过去，待他走近，莴苣姑娘认出他来，扑到他身上痛哭了起来。她的两行清泪湿润了他的眼睛，它们又变得清澈明亮，恢复了从前的视力。他带他们回到他的王国，受到热烈的欢迎，他们幸福愉快地一起生活了很久很久。





三片蛇叶


从前有一个穷人，没有钱养活自己的独生子。儿子说：“亲爱的爸爸，你这么贫困，我还拖累你，我还是自己出去挣口饭吃为好。”父亲为他祝福，非常悲伤地和他告别。这时，一个强国的国王正在征战，年轻人去从军为国王效力。当他随部队开赴战场时，前线正在打仗，形势十分危急，他周围的战友纷纷在弹雨中倒下了。虽然指挥官还在，但剩下的人都想逃跑，这时年轻人挺身而出，激励他们，高呼道：“我们决不能让祖国沦亡！”战士们随他一同冲入敌阵，狠狠打击了敌人。国王听说由于他战争才取得了胜利，便提升他，使他位居所有人之上，并给他大批珍宝，使他成为了国中的首富。

国王有一个女儿，非常美丽，但是也很奇特。她立下誓言，要娶她的男人必须答应她，如果她先死，他便要陪她一同入葬。“如果他真心爱我，我死了他还活着干吗？”她这样说。反过来说，如果他先死，她也同样给他陪葬。这奇异的誓言把所有的求婚者都给吓跑了，但年轻人被她的美貌迷住了，不顾一切地向国王请求和她结婚。“你知道你得答应什么条件吗？”国王说。

“如果她死了我还活着，”他回答说，“我得同她一起被葬入坟墓。但我非常爱她，不在乎这点危险。”于是国王同意他们结婚，并为他们举行了隆重的婚礼。

他们在一起过了一段幸福愉快的生活，后来，年轻的公主得了重病，没有一个医生能医好她的病。公主死了，年轻的驸马想起曾经许下的诺言，害怕自己被活埋在陵墓里面，但他已经没有退路：国王下令卫兵把守所有宫门，他已无法逃避等待着他的命运。到了公主的尸体被移进王室陵墓的那一天，他也被带了下去，随后墓门被锁上，还加了门闩。

墓室里，灵柩旁边有一张桌子，桌上有四盏灯、四个长面包、四瓶葡萄酒。这些食物吃完了，他就得饿死。他悲痛地坐在那里，每天只吃一点面包，喝一口酒，尽管如此，仍然感到死神日益逼近。他茫然地望着前面，忽然看见拱形墓室的墙角爬出一条蛇，越来越接近尸体。他想蛇是要去咬尸体的，便拔出剑来，说：“只要我还活着，就不许你碰她。”说着，挥剑把它斩为三段。不一会儿，从墙角又爬出一条蛇，看见那蛇死了，躺在那里，就往回跑，很快叼着三片绿叶爬过来。它把三段蛇身拼接在一起，在每处伤口贴上一片绿叶。死蛇动了，活了，两条蛇一起跑掉，撂下三片绿叶在地上。不幸的年轻人在一旁看到这整个过程，忽然想到，能使死蛇复活的叶子是否对人也能有所帮助呢？于是他捡起叶片，拿一片叶子放在公主嘴上，另外两片放在她的眼睛上。他刚放完，死者脉管里的血液便开始流动，苍白的面孔变得红润起来。她又能呼吸了，睁开眼睛问道：“上帝啊，这儿是什么地方？”

“你和我在一起，”他回答，接着向她叙述了事情的经过，以及他如何又使她死而复生。他让她吃点面包，喝点酒，她又有力气了，便站起来，走到门口，使劲敲门，大声呼喊，让卫兵听见去报告国王。国王亲自下来开门，看见两人都神采奕奕、身体健康，为他们渡过难关感到欣慰。年轻的驸马拿了那三片蛇叶，把它交给一个侍从，说：“细心保存好它们，随时带在身边，说不定有什么灾难时还用得着它们。”

那女人死而复生之后，心理却发生了变化，似乎她对她丈夫的情爱全都已从心中消失殆尽。过了一些时候，他要乘船渡海去探望父亲，他们登上了一条船，她全忘了她丈夫把她从死神手中救出来时所明示的伟大的爱和忠贞，竟然对船夫产生了恋情。一天，驸马躺着睡觉时，她把船夫叫来，自己抓住沉睡的丈夫的头，船夫抓住他的脚，把他抛下了大海。干完这无耻勾当，她对船夫说：“现在我们回去吧，就说他半路上死了。我一定要在我父亲面前夸奖你，让他同意我和你结婚，让你继承王位。”这一切，那个忠诚的侍从看在眼里，他悄悄地解开了系在大船上的一条小船，划船去寻找主人，和背信弃义者分道扬镳。他捞起死者，把随身携带的三片蛇叶分别贴在他的嘴唇和双眼上，凭着蛇叶神奇的力量，他复活了。

他们俩竭尽全力日夜划船，小船疾驶如飞，比大船还先到老国王那里。国王看见他们独自回来，感到奇怪，问他们出了什么事。当他听到他女儿的罪恶行径，他说：“我不相信她会做出这样的坏事，不过事情很快就会真相大白。”他命令他们两人藏在密室，不许见任何人。不久大船到达，那个邪恶的女人带着忧伤的表情出现在国王面前。国王说：“你怎么自己一个人回来了？你的丈夫呢？”

“啊，亲爱的爸爸，”她说，“我非常悲伤地回来，我丈夫在航行途中突然生病死了，多亏好心的船夫帮助，不然我就惨了。我丈夫去世时他也在场，他可以把一切讲给你听。”国王说：“我要叫死人再活过来。”他打开密室，唤两个人出来。那女人一见她丈夫还活着，像遭了雷击，跪下去求饶。国王说：“这是不能宽赦的！他甘愿与你同死，给你第二次生命，你却趁他熟睡害死他，你应该罪有应得。”于是公主和她的帮凶被送到一条凿穿孔的船上，推到了海里，他们很快就在波涛中沉没了。





灰姑娘


一个富人的妻子病了，她觉得自己快要死了，便把她的独生女儿叫到病床前，对她说：“亲爱的孩子，你要永远虔诚、善良，上帝会永远保佑你的，我也会从天上俯望你，与你同在。”说完，她闭上眼睛去世了。姑娘天天去她母亲坟上哀哭，她的心地一直保持着善良、虔诚。冬天来临，雪如一方白布披罩在坟上。当春天的阳光又把它的光辉洒下来的时候，那富人又讨了一个老婆。

这女人带着两个女儿进家门，她们脸蛋又白又俊，但她们的心又狠又黑。前妻的可怜的女儿日子很不好过。“蠢丫头也和我们一起坐在屋里？”她们说，“她要吃饭得靠自己去挣！滚出去，你这厨房的丫头！”她们拿走她的漂亮衣服，给她穿一件旧灰褂子和木屐。“瞧这骄傲的公主打扮的德行！”她们叫着，笑着，把她带到厨房。她得从早到晚干重活，天不亮就得起床，挑水、生火、做饭、洗衣服。两个妹妹还想出种种点子作弄她、嘲笑她，她们把豌豆和扁豆倒在炉灰里，叫她再把它们一粒粒拣出来。晚上，她干活干得很累了，没有床让她睡觉，她只好躺在炉灶旁的灰土里。因为她总是浑身灰土，样子很脏，她们就管她叫“灰姑娘”。

有一次，父亲要去赶年市，问两个继女要什么东西。一个说要“漂亮的衣裳”，另一个说要“珍珠和宝石”。“你呢，灰姑娘，”父亲说，“你想要什么？”

“爸爸，在你回家的路上，请你折下第一根碰到你的帽子的树枝，把它带来！”于是他为两个继女买了漂亮的衣服、珍珠和宝石；骑马回家穿过一片绿色灌木林的时候，一根榛树的枝条碰着他，他的帽子掉在地上，他就折下这榛树枝，带回家去。到了家里，他给了继女所要的东西，给了灰姑娘那根榛树的枝条。灰姑娘对他表示感谢，把那根树枝种在母亲的坟上。她哭得十分伤心，泪水掉在泥土上，浇灌着榛树的枝条，这枝条生长成了一棵美丽的小树。灰姑娘每天三次去那棵树下哭泣、祈祷，每次树上总停着一只白色的小鸟，她想要什么，一说出口，小鸟儿就把她希望得到的东西扔下来送给她。

有一次，国王要举行为期三天的舞会，邀请全国年轻美貌的姑娘参加，让他的儿子从中挑选一个未婚妻。灰姑娘的两个异母妹妹听说她们也被邀请参加，非常高兴，便大声对灰姑娘说：“给我们梳头、擦鞋、结好鞋扣，我们要去王宫参加舞会。”灰姑娘遵命照办，但她哭了，因为她也很想一起去参加舞会。她请求继母允许她去。“灰姑娘，”继母说，“你浑身灰土，这么脏还想去参加舞会？你没有衣服又没有鞋，还想跳舞？”但她仍不断恳求，终于，继母说：“我把一碗扁豆倒在炉灰里，要是你能在两小时内把扁豆都拣出来，就让你去。”灰姑娘从后门走进花园，叫道：“温顺的小鸽子、小斑鸠，天空中所有的小鸟儿，请你们都来帮我拣豆子。”她唱道：





好的豆拣进碗里，

坏的豆吞进肚里。





于是从厨房的窗户飞进来两只小白鸽，接着飞进来几只小斑鸠，后来天空中所有的小鸟儿都叽叽喳喳地飞来了，落在灰堆的周围。小鸽子点着头，开始一粒一粒地拣豆，其他鸟儿也开始一粒粒地啄着，把好的豆统统拣进碗里。不到一个钟头，它们就拣完豆，又飞走了。灰姑娘高高兴兴地把一碗豆给继母端去，满以为她会让她去参加舞会了。但继母说：“不行，灰姑娘，你没有好衣服，没法跳舞。你只会让人笑话。”灰姑娘哭了，继母说：“要是你能在一个钟头内把两碗满满的扁豆从灰堆里拣出来，拣得干干净净，就让你一起去。”她想，这是灰姑娘永远无法做到的。继母把两碗扁豆倒在炉灰里，姑娘从后门走进花园，叫道：“温顺的小鸽子、小斑鸠，天空中所有的小鸟儿，请你们都来帮我拣豆子”。她唱道：





好的豆拣进碗里，

坏的豆吞进肚里。





于是从厨房的窗户飞进来两只小白鸽，接着飞进来几只小斑鸠，后来天空中所有的小鸟儿叽叽喳喳地都飞来了，落在灰堆的周围。小鸽子点着头，开始一粒一粒地拣豆，其他鸟儿也开始一粒粒地啄着，把好的豆统统拣进碗里。不到半个钟头，它们就拣完豆，又飞走了。姑娘高高兴兴地把豆子给继母端去，满以为她会让她去参加盛会了。继母却说：“什么都帮不了你的忙。你不能去，因为你没有好衣裳，无法跳舞；你去了，我们会为你感到丢人现眼的。”说罢，她转过身去，背对着灰姑娘，带上她那两个骄傲的女儿匆匆走了。

现在家里没有别人了，灰姑娘来到母亲坟前的榛树下哀求：





小树啊，你摇一摇，晃一晃，

把金子银子撒在我身上！





鸟儿给她抛下一件金丝银线织成的衣裳和一双用丝绸和银线缝制的舞鞋。她匆匆忙忙穿上那件衣裳去参加舞会。她穿着金色衣裳是那么漂亮，她的两个妹妹和继母都认不出她来，以为她是一位外国的公主。她们根本就想不到会是灰姑娘，以为这会儿她正坐在家里拣扁豆，浑身脏兮兮的。王子向灰姑娘走过来，握着她的手，和她跳舞。他只和她跳舞，不和别人跳，他握着她的手不放。如果有人来请灰姑娘跳舞，他就说：“这是我的舞伴。”

灰姑娘一直跳舞跳到晚上。她要回家了，王子说：“我送你回去。”因为他要看看这位美丽的姑娘是谁家的。灰姑娘到了家门口，便从王子身边逃走，一跃跳进了鸽房。王子等她父亲回来，告诉他那位不知姓名的姑娘跳进了鸽房。老头子心想：“莫非是灰姑娘？”他只好给王子拿来斧子和锄头，让他劈开鸽房。可是里面没有人。回到家里，只见灰姑娘穿着她那身脏衣服躺在灰堆上，壁炉架上点着一盏暗淡的小油灯。原来灰姑娘很快就从鸽房后面跳下来，跑到小榛树那儿，脱下漂亮的衣裳，放在坟上，鸟儿又把它收走了，她这才又穿上旧灰褂子，坐在了灰堆旁边。

第二天，盛会重新开始，父母和两个异母妹妹都走了，灰姑娘来到榛树下说：

小树啊，你摇一摇，晃一晃，

把金子银子撒在我身上！





鸟儿又扔下一件比前一天还要华丽得多的衣裳。当她穿着这件衣裳出现在盛会上时，人们见她这么美丽，都很惊奇。王子一直在等着，她一来，王子就握着她的手，只和她一个人跳舞。如果有人来请灰姑娘跳舞，他就说：“这是我的舞伴。”到了晚上，她要走了，王子尾随在她身后，想看她会走进哪一座房子。但她一下子跳开，跑到了屋后的花园里。花园里有一株美丽的大树，枝头挂着鲜美的梨子。王子等她父亲回来，对他说：“那位不知姓名的姑娘从我身边跑了，我想她上了梨树。”父亲心想：“莫非是灰姑娘？”他让人拿斧子来，砍倒梨树，可是树上一个人也没有。他们到厨房去，看见灰姑娘身上穿着灰褂子，像往常那样躺在灰堆上。原来她早就跳下梨树，把美丽的衣裳还给小榛树上的鸟儿，自己又穿上了灰褂子。

第三天，父母和妹妹走后，灰姑娘又去她母亲坟上，对小榛树说：





小树啊，你摇一摇，晃一晃，

把金子银子撒在我身上！





于是鸟儿给她扔下一件衣裳、一双舞鞋，那衣裳华美无比，光辉夺目，真是举世无双，那双舞鞋整个儿都是金子做的。她穿了这身衣裳来到舞会上，所有的人都惊奇得不知道该说什么好。王子只和她一人跳舞，如果有人来请灰姑娘跳舞，他就说：“这是我的舞伴！”

到了晚上，灰姑娘要走了，王子要陪她回去，她很快跑了，他追不上她。但王子预先设下一个计策，叫人把所有台阶全都涂上沥青；灰姑娘跑下台阶时，左脚的舞鞋被沥青粘住了。王子把它捡起来，发现它小巧、精美，整个儿都是金子做的。第二天早晨，他带上这只鞋去见那个富商，对他说：“我要娶能穿上这只金鞋的女子做妻子。”继母的两个女儿都很高兴，因为她们的脚很好看。大姐拿了鞋到房里试穿，母亲站在一旁观看。可是她的脚趾头太大，鞋太小，穿不进去，母亲递给她一把刀，说：“把脚趾剁下来，当上王后就用不着走路了。”姑娘剁下脚趾头，硬把脚塞进金鞋里去，咬紧牙关，强忍疼痛，去见王子。王子拿她当自己的新娘子，扶她上马，带她回去。经过坟墓的时候，小榛树上的两只鸽子高声啼鸣：





回头瞧瞧，回头瞧，

鞋里面鲜血流淌，

鞋儿太小，鞋太小，

家里那个才是真新娘。





王子瞥一眼她的脚，一见鲜血涌流，便拨转马头，把假新娘送回家去，说这位不是真的新娘，要她的妹妹来穿金鞋。妹妹走进房间，很幸运地把脚趾头伸进了鞋里，可是脚后跟太大，套不进去。母亲递给她一把刀，说：“把脚后跟剁一块下来，当上王后就用不着走路了。”姑娘剁下一块脚后跟，硬把脚塞进金鞋里去，咬紧牙关，强忍疼痛，去见王子。王子拿她当自己的新娘子，扶她上马，带她回去。经过坟墓的时候，小榛树上的两只鸽子高声啼鸣：





回头瞧瞧，回头瞧，

鞋里面鲜血流淌，

鞋儿太小，鞋太小，

家里那个才是真新娘。





王子瞥一眼她的脚，只见鲜血从鞋子里面涌出来，把白色的长袜染成了一片血红。他便拨转马头，把假新娘送回家去，说：“这位也不是真的新娘，你们再没有别的女儿了吗？”

“没有了，”老头子说，“家里就还有我已故的前妻生的一个可怜的灰姑娘，她不可能是新娘子。”王子要他把她叫来，母亲却说：“不用了，她太脏，见不得人。”可是王子无论如何要见一见她，他们只得让灰姑娘出来。灰姑娘把手和脸洗得很干净，然后出来，向王子鞠躬，王子把金鞋递给她。她坐在一只小板凳上，脱下脚上笨重的木屐，穿上金鞋，这鞋就像是为她的脚定做的。她站起来，王子看着她的面庞，马上认出她就是那个和自己跳过舞的美丽的姑娘，他大声说：“她就是真的新娘！”继母和两个妹妹又惊又气，脸色煞白。王子扶灰姑娘上马，带她回宫。他们经过坟墓的时候，小榛树上的两只鸽子高声啼鸣：





回头瞧瞧，回头瞧，

鞋里没有鲜血了，

鞋儿不小，鞋不小，

他领真的新娘子回家了。





叫完了，两只白鸽双双飞下枝头，停在灰姑娘肩上，一只在左边，一只在右边，停落不走了。

王子要举行婚礼了，灰姑娘那两个虚情假意的姊妹也来奉承，想和她同享幸福。新婚夫妇上教堂去，大妹妹走在右边，小妹妹走在左边；这时，两只鸽子啄掉了她们一人一只眼睛。她们随即向门外奔去，大的在左边，小的在右边。鸽子又啄掉了她们另一只眼睛。她们凶狠又虚伪，受罚做瞎子一直到死。





霍勒太太


从前，有个寡妇她有两个女儿，一个美丽又勤快，一个丑陋又懒惰。但她更爱那个又丑又懒的，因为那是她的亲生女儿，家里所有的活都叫另一个去做，她成了家里的灰姑娘。这个可怜的女孩得天天坐在当街的一口水井旁边纺线，一直纺到手指流血。

有一天，鲜血染红了纺锤，她拿着纺锤弯腰探进水井，要把它洗干净，不料纺锤从她手中掉到井里去了。她哭着跑回去向继母诉说这件不幸的事情。狠心的继母责骂她说：“是你让纺锤掉到井里去的，你得把它捞上来！”

小姑娘回到水井旁边，不知怎么办才好。她心里害怕，就跳进井里找纺锤。她在水里失去了知觉，醒来时发现自己正躺在一片美丽的草地上，阳光明媚，草地上盛开着成千上万朵鲜花。小姑娘在草地上朝前走，来到一个烤面包炉旁边；满满一炉子面包喊叫着：“喂，把我抽出去，把我抽出去，我快烤煳了！我早就烤熟了！”小姑娘走过去，用面包铲把面包一个个都取出来。她又继续往前走，来到一棵果实累累的苹果树下，苹果树冲她喊：“喂，摇晃我，摇晃我，树上的苹果都熟了。”小姑娘摇晃苹果树，苹果雨点般纷纷坠落。她一直摇晃到树上一只苹果也没有了才停下，接着又把地上的苹果捡起来，放在一起，然后继续往前走。最后她来到一座小房子前面，一位老太太探出头朝外面张望，小姑娘见她牙齿特别大，心里害怕，转身就要跑开。老太太在她背后喊：“你害怕什么呢，好孩子？待在我这儿吧！如果你肯把家里的活儿都做得很好，你会过上好日子的。只是得注意好好整理我的床铺，使劲抖被子，抖得羽绒飞起来，那样，世上就会下雪了。我是霍勒太太。”老太太对她说话很和气，小姑娘不再害怕了，便答应留下来替她做事。她无论做什么事情，都做得让老太太满意，总是使劲抖她的被子，抖得羽绒像雪花似地四处飞舞。她干活勤快，在老太太那儿生活得很好，从没听过一句骂她的话，天天又烧又炖，吃得很好。

小姑娘在霍勒太太那儿住了一段时间，心里渐渐感到悲伤，起初自己也说不清哪儿不对劲儿，后来才知道是想家了。虽然她在这里的生活比在家里好千百倍，但她还是想家。最后她对霍勒太太说：“我想家想得厉害，在您这里的生活很好，但我不能再住下去了，我必须回去，和我家里的人在一起。”霍勒太太说：“你想回家去，我很高兴，你一直这么忠心地为我服务，我要亲自送你上去。”说罢，她拉着小姑娘的手，领她走到大门口。门开了，小姑娘正好站在大门下面，这时忽然落下一阵很大的金雨，金子全都粘在了她身上，她浑身上下都是黄金。“你一直那么勤快，这是你应得的。”霍勒太太说，把原先掉到井里的纺锤还给她。接着，大门关上了，小姑娘又回到那离继母家不远的地方。

她走进院子的时候，蹲在井上的公鸡叫起来：





喔喔！喔喔！

咱们的金姑娘回来了！





小姑娘进屋去见继母，因为她全身都是金子，所以受到了继母和妹妹的热情接待。

小姑娘讲了她亲身经历的一切，继母听罢，很想让她那个又丑又懒的女儿也有这一份福气。于是，丑姑娘只得坐在水井旁边纺线。为了使她的纺锤染上鲜血，她把手伸进荆棘树篱，自己扎破手指，然后把带血的纺锤扔进水井，自己跟着跳了下去。同她那勤劳美丽的姐姐一样，她来到一片美丽的草地，沿着同一条路往前走。她走到烤面包炉旁边，面包又叫喊：“喂，把我抽出去，把我抽出去，我快烤煳了！我早就烤熟了！”懒姑娘回答说：“我才不乐意把自己弄脏呢。”说完继续往前走。不一会儿，她走到苹果树前，苹果树喊叫着：“喂，摇晃我，摇晃我，树上的苹果都熟了。”她却回答说：“说得轻巧，苹果掉下来还不砸我的脑袋？!”她只管往前走。

她到了霍勒太太的房子前面，因为听说过她的牙齿很大，所以她并不害怕，马上答应做她的女仆。

第一天她强打精神，干活勤快，霍勒太太要她做什么，她就去做，因为她想着霍勒太太会送她许多许多金子。可是第二天她就开始偷懒，第三天更懒，早晨赖在床上不起来。她不给霍勒太太整理床铺，这本是她分内该做的；也不把被子抖得羽绒纷飞。不久，霍勒太太就厌烦了，不要她做工了。懒姑娘乐不可支，满心以为金雨就要来了。霍勒太太同样领她到大门口，她站在大门下面的时候，落下的不是金雨，而是满满一锅沥青。“这是你做工的报酬。”霍勒太太说完便关上了大门。

懒姑娘回家来，浑身上下都是沥青，井上的公鸡见了她，大叫起来：





喔喔！喔喔！

咱们的脏姑娘回来了！





沥青牢牢地粘在她的身上，一直到死也洗不掉。





七只乌鸦


有一个男人有七个儿子，他很想要个女儿。终于有一天，他的妻子又怀孕了，生下一个女孩。他们非常高兴，可是孩子瘦小、身体虚弱，需要行紧急洗礼。父亲派一个儿子赶快去井边打水作洗礼用，其他六个也都跟着一起去，人人争着要第一个把水打上来，结果把水桶掉到井里去了。他们站在那里，不知该怎么办好，谁都不敢回家。左等右等孩子们总也没回来，父亲不耐烦了，说：“他们一定是玩得忘了，这些坏孩子！”他怕女孩没来得及行洗礼就死了，一气之下，大声说：“我要这些小子都变成乌鸦。”话音刚落，就听见头顶上传来一阵鸟儿飞行的声音，他抬头仰望空中，只见七只像煤炭一样黑的乌鸦飞掠过去。

父母再也无法收回咒语，虽然失去七个儿子十分伤心，但他们那个心爱的小女儿身体渐渐变得强壮起来，而且出落得一天比一天美丽，多少也给他们一些安慰。很长时间她甚至不知道自己曾经有好几个哥哥，因为父母很小心地避免在她面前提起他们，一直到有一天偶然听到人们议论，说这女孩子是很漂亮，但就是因为她，她的哥哥们才遭遇不幸。她听了很难过，回去问父母究竟她有没有哥哥，他们在哪里？父母再也不能继续瞒着她了，但他们说这是天降灾难，并非她的过错。可是这女孩天天为此心里难过，认为自己有责任去解救她的哥哥们。她终日坐立不安，后来悄悄离家出走，决心走遍天涯海角，无论如何也要找到哥哥们的踪迹，把他们解救出来。她随身只带了一枚父母的小戒指作纪念，一个长面包充饥，一壶水解渴，一把累了能坐一坐的小椅子。

她不停地走，走得很远很远，几乎走到了世界的尽头。她去找太阳，太阳太热，非常可怕，还吃小孩子。她赶紧逃走，跑去找月亮，可是月亮太冷，又很凶残，见了她，说：“我闻到人肉味儿了。”她赶忙离开，去找星星，星星都待她很和气、很友好，每一个都坐在自己的特别的小椅子上。晨星站起来，给她一只雏鸡腿，说：“你的哥哥们在玻璃山中，没有这只雏鸡腿，你就打不开玻璃山的锁。”

姑娘接过雏鸡腿，用一小块布仔细包好，又继续走，走了很久，终于走到了玻璃山。山门锁着，姑娘要取出雏鸡腿，打开布包一看，里面是空的，好心的星星赠送的礼物丢了。现在她该怎么办呢？她要解救她的哥哥们，可是没有打开玻璃山的钥匙。善良的小妹妹拿出一把小刀，切下自己一根小指头，把它塞到大门里去，幸运地打开了大门。她进入大门，迎面走来一个小矮人，说：“我的孩子，你找什么？”

“我找我的哥哥们——七只乌鸦。”她回答。小矮人说：“乌鸦先生们不在家，你如果要等他们就进来吧。”说着，小矮人端来盛放乌鸦的食物的七张小盘子和七只小酒杯，小妹妹从每个盘子里拿一小块面包吃，从每只杯子里喝小一口酒。她把她随身携带的小戒指放在最后一只小酒杯里。

忽然，她听到空中一阵鸟鸣声和风声，小矮人说：“乌鸦先生们回来了。”他们回来要吃要喝，找他们的小盘子、小酒杯。他们一个接一个地说：“谁吃了我小盘子里的东西？谁喝了我小酒杯里的酒？是人的嘴碰过的。”第七只乌鸦小酒杯里的酒快喝完了，小戒指滚向他的嘴边，他看见了，认出这是父母的戒指，他说：“上帝保佑，如果我们的小妹妹来了，我们就得救了。”姑娘听到这个愿望，就从门后走出来，于是七只乌鸦恢复了人形。他们互相拥抱、亲吻，高高兴兴地回家去了。





小红帽


从前有一个可爱的小女孩，人见人爱，最疼爱她的是她的奶奶。奶奶什么都舍得给她，就是不知道还该给她什么才好。有一次，奶奶送她一顶红色天鹅绒的帽子，小女孩戴着非常合适，再也不肯戴别的帽子了，因此大家都叫她小红帽。

有一天，妈妈对她说：“过来，小红帽，这儿有一块糕点和一瓶葡萄酒，你给奶奶送去，她病了，身体弱，这会使她精神好点。趁天凉快，你赶紧出发吧！出了家门，好好走路，别离开大路乱跑，不然的话，你会摔倒、打破酒瓶，奶奶就吃不上也喝不上了。走进奶奶房间的时候，别忘了问奶奶早上好，别光顾东张西望！”

“我会把所有的事情都办好的！”小红帽对妈妈说。

可是奶奶住在树林里，离村子有半个钟头路程。小红帽一走进树林就遇见一只狼。小红帽不知道狼是凶恶的野兽，见了狼也不害怕。

“你好，小红帽！”狼说。

“你好，狼先生！”

“一大早到哪儿去啊，小红帽？”

“去看望我奶奶。”

“你身上带的是什么东西？”

“糕点和葡萄酒。我们昨天烘烤的，要让害病体弱的奶奶补补身体。”

“小红帽，你奶奶住在哪里？”

“在树林里。再走一刻钟，三棵大橡树下面就是她的家，那下边有胡桃树篱，你到那儿一看就知道了。”小红帽说。

狼心里想：“这年幼娇嫩的孩子最可口，准比老太婆还要好吃。要两个都吃到，可得用计谋。”它跟在小红帽身边走了一会儿，然后开口说：“小红帽，你看周围美丽的花朵，干吗不停下来好好看看？我想，小鸟儿唱得多么动听，你全没听见吧？你只顾着走路，就像是要去上学似的！在树林里多么快乐。”

小红帽抬头看见阳光透过树木跳跃闪烁，到处是烂漫的鲜花，心里想：“如果我给奶奶捎去一束鲜花，她一定很高兴。天色还这么早，我不会到得太晚的。”于是她离开道路，奔进树林采花。采了一朵，觉得远处那朵更美丽，又跑过去，向密林深处越跑越远。

这时候，那只狼却径直向奶奶家奔去，敲她的门。

“外面是谁呀？”

“小红帽送糕点和葡萄酒来了，快开门！”

“按一下门把，门就开了！”奶奶大声说，“我身体太弱，起不了床。”

狼按下门把，门弹开了，它一声不吭，径直向奶奶的床扑去，把她一口吞了下去，接着又穿上奶奶的衣服，戴上奶奶的软帽，躺在奶奶的床上，拉上帐子。

小红帽跑来跑去寻觅鲜花，采的鲜花多得快抱不动了，才忽然又想起奶奶，赶忙去找她。到了奶奶家，看见门开着，她心里好生奇怪，一走进房间，就感觉那里很异样，她想：“上帝啊，我今天心里怎么这样害怕，平常我多么喜欢待在奶奶身边！”她喊了一声：“早上好！”可是没有回答。便走到床前，拉开帐子。“奶奶”躺在床上，软帽戴得很低，遮住了脸，那样子十分古怪。



“哎，奶奶，你的耳朵真大！”

“耳朵大才听得明白你说什么！”

“哎，奶奶，你的眼睛真大！”

“眼睛大才能把你看得一清二楚！”

“哎，奶奶，你的手真大！”

“手大才能逮着你！”

“奶奶，你的嘴巴怎么大得吓人！”

“嘴巴大才能一口吃掉你！”

话音未落，狼跃下床，张口吞下了可怜的小红帽。

狼的欲望得到了满足，又再上床睡觉，发出极大的鼾声。这时正好猎人从这所房子经过，他想：“老太太打呼噜这么响！是不是病了？得去看看。”于是他进屋，走近床前一看，原来是狼躺在那儿。“我可找到你了，你这老坏蛋。”他说，“我找你找很久了。”他正要举起猎枪，忽然想起狼可能已经把老奶奶吃了，或许她还有救，便没开枪，而去拿了一把剪刀，剪开狼的肚子。铰了几剪刀，小姑娘就跳出来，大声喊道：“啊，吓死我了，狼肚子里黑咕隆咚的！”接着，老奶奶也出来了，她还活着，差点儿不能喘气。小红帽迅速搬了些大石头，填满狼的肚子，狼醒了，要跳起来逃走，可是石头很重，它一跳起来，马上又栽倒在地上死了。

三个人都很高兴。猎人剥了狼皮带回家去；奶奶吃了小红帽带来的糕点，喝了葡萄酒，重新恢复了健康。小红帽心里想：“我再也不自己一个人离开大路跑进树林里去了。”

又有人这样讲：有一次，小红帽又给老奶奶送烤饼去，另一只狼和她说话，要引诱她离开大路。小红帽早有防备，径直走她的路，后来她告诉奶奶，说她遇见了一只狼，狼跟她问好，可是眼里露出凶光，如果不是在大路上，它真会把她吃了。“来，”奶奶说，“我们把门锁好，让它进不来。”过了不久，狼来敲门，大声叫喊：“快开门，奶奶，我是小红帽，我给你送烤饼来了。”她们静静待着不出声，也不开门。那只灰狼绕着房子转了几圈，最后跳到房顶上去，想等到晚上小红帽回家时尾随着她，在黑暗中把她吃掉。但是奶奶知道它打什么主意。她家房前有一个很大的石槽，老奶奶对孩子说：“小红帽，昨天我煮了香肠，你用水桶把煮香肠的水倒在石槽里。”小红帽一桶一桶地往石槽里倒了很久，一直到把很大很大的石槽都装满了水。香肠的味儿钻到狼的鼻子里，它一边嗅着，一边看下面，脖子伸得太长了，脚下站不稳，开始往下滑，从屋顶上一头栽下来，掉在大石槽里淹死了。小红帽欢欢喜喜地回家了，从此再没有谁伤害她。





三根金发的魔鬼


从前有一个贫穷的女人生了一个儿子，儿子出生时身上裹着胎膜，有人就预言他十四岁时会娶公主做妻子。过了不久，国王到村里来，谁都不知道他是国王，他问起村里有什么新闻，人们就回答说：“前几天这里的一个女人生了一个带胎膜的孩子，据说这种人做什么事情都能成功。有人还预言他十四岁那年会娶国王的女儿做妻子。”国王心地狠毒，听了这预言很生气，他去找孩子的父母，装出和气的样子，说：“你们是穷人，把孩子交给我吧，我会照料他的。”起初他们不愿把孩子交给他，但陌生人出了一大笔钱，他们想：“他是个幸运儿，总会逢凶化吉的。”终于同意把孩子给他。

国王把孩子放在一个盒子里面，骑马带着他来到一条很深的河边，把盒子扔到河里，心想：“我帮助我女儿摆脱了一个不受欢迎的求婚者。”但是这盒子没有下沉，它像一只小船一样在水上漂流，也没有一滴水灌进盒子里。它漂流到离国王的京城两英里的地方，那里有一座磨坊，盒子搁浅在磨坊的堤坝边上。碰巧一个磨坊的伙计看见了它，就用钩子把它钩过来，以为得到了大宗财宝，打开一看，却是一个健康活泼的漂亮男孩躺在里面。他把孩子给磨坊主夫妇送去，他们没有孩子，便很高兴地说：“这是上帝赐予我们的。”他们精心抚养这个弃儿，他渐渐长大，各方面品德都很好。

有一天，国王为了避雷雨走进磨坊，他问磨坊主夫妇，那个高个子少年是不是他们的儿子。“不，”他们回答说，“这是一个弃儿，十四年前躺在一个盒子里漂流到堤坝边上，磨坊的伙计把他从水里钩上来的。”国王知道这孩子不是别人，正是他扔到水里的那个幸运儿，就说：“你们两位好心人，能不能让这个孩子送一封信给王后？我要赏他两块金币。”

“国王的命令，一定照办。”他们回答完就叫男孩准备启程。国王给王后写了一封信，信里说：“送这封信的男孩子一到，就把他杀了、埋掉，这一切在我回来之前都要办好。”

男孩带了这封信启程，但他迷了路，晚上走到一座森林里去了。黑暗中他看见一个小小的亮光，径直朝它走去，走到一座小房子跟前，便走了进去。屋里只有一个老太婆独自坐在火堆旁边。她看见少年进来，吃了一惊，说：“你从哪里来，要到哪里去？”

“我从磨坊来，”他回答说，“我要去找王后，给她送一封信；可是我在森林里迷了路，想在这里住一夜。”

“你这可怜的孩子，”老太太说，“你跑到强盗窝里来了，他们一回来，就会杀死你。”

“谁要来就来吧，”少年说，“我不怕，我累得再也走不动了。”说着，他躺在一条长凳上睡着了。不久，强盗们回来了，怒气冲冲地问道，躺在那里的陌生人是谁。“啊，”老太太说，“这是个纯洁无辜的孩子，在森林里迷了路，我可怜他，把他收留下来，他有一封信要交给王后。”强盗们拆开信看，信里说，这男孩一到，就要马上把他杀了。这些硬心肠的强盗起了怜悯之心，强盗首领把信撕了，另写一封，信里说，这男孩一到，就要他马上和公主结婚。他们让他在长板凳上安安静静地睡到第二天早晨，交给他那封信，又给他指了正确的路。王后收到信件，看了以后，就照信里吩咐的那样，下令举行盛大豪华的婚礼，公主和幸运儿结婚了。因为这少年英俊又友善，公主和他在一起生活得很快乐、很满意。

过了一段时间，国王回到王宫，发现预言应验了，幸运儿已经和他的女儿结了婚。“这是怎么回事？”他说，“我在信里下的命令不是这样的。”王后把信递给他，叫他自己看里面写了些什么。国王看了信，发现信被人换了。他问年轻人叫他送的那封信哪儿去了，为什么他把另一封信送来了。“我一点儿也不知道，”他回答说，“信一定是我那天夜里在森林里睡着的时候被人调换的。”国王勃然大怒说：“不能让你这么容易得手。谁要得到我的女儿，就得从地狱里取来魔鬼头上的三根金发；你能把我要的东西给我拿来，就可以继续和我女儿做夫妻。”国王希望以此永远甩掉他。但幸运儿却回答：“我会拿到金发的，我不怕魔鬼。”说完，他就告别众人，踏上了旅途。

他沿着大路走到一座大城市，城门口的卫兵盘问他能干什么活，知道些什么。“我无所不知，无所不晓。”幸运儿回答说。

“那你可以帮我们一个忙，”卫兵说，“告诉我们，为什么我们市集广场上的井往常能喷涌出葡萄酒，现在连一点儿水都没有了？”

“你们会知道的，”他回答说，“你们等着吧，等我回来。”他继续往前走，来到另一座城市，那里的城门卫兵又问他能干什么活，知道些什么。“我无所不知，无所不晓。”幸运儿回答说。

“那你可以帮我们一个忙，告诉我们，为什么我们城里的一棵树往常能长出金苹果，现在却连叶子也不长了？”

“你们会知道的，”他回答说，“你们等着吧，等我回来。”他继续往前走，来到一条大河边。他要过河，摆渡的船夫问他能干什么活，知道些什么。“我无所不知，无所不晓。”幸运儿回答说。

“那你可以帮我个忙，”船夫说，“为什么总得我摆渡来摆渡去，老是没有人来接替我？”

“你会知道的，”他回答说，“你等着吧，等我回来。”

过了河，他就找到了进入地狱的大门。地狱里面黑黝黝的，粘满煤烟，魔鬼没在家，他的老祖母坐在一张宽大的安乐椅上。“你来干什么，年轻人？”她对他说，样子一点儿也不凶。“我要魔鬼头上的三根金发，”他回答说，“要是拿不到，我就会失去我的妻子。”

“你的要求太过分了，”她说，“要是魔鬼回家发现了你，你就没命了。不过我可怜你，我要看看能不能帮你点忙。”她把他变成一只蚂蚁，说：“爬到我的裙子折缝里来，你在这里很安全。”

“好的，”他回答，“这样很好，不过还有三件事情是我很想知道的：为什么往常喷涌出葡萄酒的一口井变干涸了，现在连水也没有？为什么往常结出金苹果的一棵树，现在连叶子也不长了？为什么一个摆渡的船夫总是摆渡来摆渡去，也没有一个人来替换他？”

“这是些很难的问题，”她回答说，“你一定要安安静静待着，不要出声，我拔魔鬼三根金发的时候，你要注意听他说些什么。”

晚上，魔鬼回家。一进家门，他就觉得空气不纯净。“我闻到有人肉味，”他说，“这里情况不对头。”他在所有犄角旮旯察看、寻找，什么也没有找到。老祖母骂他：“我刚才才打扫过，把所有的东西整理好了，你现在又给我翻腾得乱七八糟；无论什么时候你鼻子里都总能闻到人肉味！坐下来吃你的晚饭吧！”他吃完了，喝过了，累了，头枕在老祖母怀里，要她给他抓虱子。不久，他睡着了，出气很粗，直打呼噜。老祖母揪着一根金发，拔下来放在一边。“哎哟！”魔鬼叫喊起来，“你干什么呀？”

“我做了个噩梦，”老祖母回答说，“就揪了你的头发。”

“梦见什么了？”魔鬼问。

“我梦见市集广场上有一口井，往常它喷涌出葡萄酒，现在干涸了，连水也流不出来，这是什么缘故？”

“哼，他们哪能知道！”魔鬼回答说，“井里一块石头下面有一只癞蛤蟆；把它打死，葡萄酒就又流出来了。”老祖母又给他抓虱子，他又睡着了，鼾声震得窗户颤动起来。老祖母拔了他第二根头发。“哎哟，你干什么？”魔鬼生气地喊叫。“别发火，”她回答说，“我做梦呢。”

“又做什么梦了？”他问。

“我梦见一个王国里有一棵果树，往常都结金苹果，现在连叶子也不长了。这是什么原因？”

“哼，他们哪能知道！”魔鬼回答说，“有一只耗子在咬树根；把它打死，这棵树就还能长出金苹果，如果还让它继续咬下去，这棵树就会完全枯死。别再拿那些梦来烦我了，我睡着你要再把我弄醒，我就给你一个耳光。”老祖母答应他，又给他抓虱子，他又睡着了，打起呼噜。她揪住他的第三根头发，拔了出来。魔鬼跳起来，大喊大叫，要和她算帐，老祖母又一次使他的气消下来，说：“要做噩梦，谁有什么办法！”

“你又做什么梦了？”他问，毕竟很好奇。

“我梦见一个摆渡的船夫诉苦说，总是他摆渡来摆渡去，也没人去替换他。这究竟是怎么一回事？”

“哼，这笨蛋！”魔鬼回答说，“如果有人要过河，他只要把船篙往那人手里一塞，那人就得摆渡，他不就自由了？”老祖母已经拔了他三根金发，三个问题也都回答了，她就让魔鬼安安稳稳地一觉睡到天亮。

魔鬼走了以后，老太太把蚂蚁从裙子皱褶里面拿出来，让幸运儿恢复了人形。“给你这三根金发，”她说，“魔鬼回答三个问题时说的话你都听见了吧？”

“是的，”他回答说，“我都听见了，我会牢牢记住的。”

“忙已经帮了，”她说，“你现在可以走了。”

他感谢老太太在危难中给予他帮助，让他离开地狱。这一切办得这么顺利，他很高兴。到了摆渡的船夫那儿，船夫要他兑现诺言，回答问题。“先把我摆渡到对岸，”幸运儿说，“我就告诉你怎样解脱。”到了对岸，他把魔鬼的主意转告船夫说：“如果又有人来，要坐渡船到对岸，你只要把船篙放在他手上就行了。”他继续往前走，来到那棵不长果实的树所在的城市，卫兵也要他回答问题。他把从魔鬼那儿听到的告诉他，说：“杀死那只咬树根的耗子，这棵树就会再结出金苹果。”卫兵感谢他，酬谢他两只驮满黄金的驴子，跟随在他后面。最后，他来到那座水井干涸了的城市。他把魔鬼说的话告诉卫兵：“井里一块石头下面有一只癞蛤蟆，你们得把它找出来，打死它，井就会涌出很多很多葡萄酒。”卫兵感谢他，也赠送他两只驮着黄金的驴子。

幸运儿终于回到家里，回到妻子身边，他的妻子和他重逢，听他说一切都很成功，心里非常高兴。他给国王送去他所要的魔鬼的三根金发，国王看见四只驴子驮着黄金，高兴得不得了，说：“现在所有的条件都满足了，你可以永远和我的女儿在一起了。不过，亲爱的女婿，请你告诉我，这么多黄金是哪儿来的？这可是巨大的财富啊！”

“我曾经渡过一条河，”他回答说，“这些黄金就是我从那儿带来的，那儿河岸边没有沙子，都是黄金。”

“我也可以拿一些吗？”国王贪婪地问。

“您想拿多少就拿多少，”他回答，“河上有个摆渡的船夫，您让他把您摆渡过去，到了对岸，您就可以装满您的袋子了。”贪心的国王急忙上路，到了河边，挥手让船夫把他摆渡过去。船夫过来，叫他上船，到了对岸，他把船篙塞在国王手里，自己跳上岸走了。从此国王不得不在那儿摆渡，这是对他的罪孽的惩罚。

“他还在摆渡吗？”

“应该还在，因为大概没有一个人从他那儿接过船篙。”





裁缝在天堂里


一个晴朗的日子，亲爱的上帝要去天堂的花园，所有使徒和圣徒都随他前往，天堂里就只留下圣彼得一人。上帝命令他，在他外出期间不许放任何人进来，于是圣彼得站在大门口守卫。不久，有人敲门。圣彼得问谁在外面，要干什么。“我是一个诚实的穷裁缝，”一个细嗓子回答说，“请求放我进去。”

“不错，真的，”圣彼得说，“你就像上了绞刑架的小偷一样老实，你给人家裁衣服偷人家的衣料。你不能进天堂，主不许我在他外出期间放任何人进来。”

“请你可怜可怜我吧，”裁缝大声说，“自己从桌上掉下去的小块布不是我偷的，也不值一提。请看，我走路一瘸一拐的，走得脚上起了泡，我无法再往回走了。求你放我进去吧，再次的活我都肯干。抱孩子，洗尿布，擦洗孩子们在上面玩的板凳，补小孩衣裳，我都愿意做。”圣彼得动了恻隐之心，把天堂的大门给瘸裁缝开了一条缝，让他那干巴瘦小的身体刚好能挤进去。他必须一声不响地在门后的墙角静静待着，上帝回来时别让他看见，惹他生气。裁缝当时听从了他的吩咐；可是圣彼得一到门口去，他就站起来，满怀好奇地到处溜达，看这看那，最后他来到一个地方，那里有许多又好看又贵重的椅子，当中有一把纯金的扶手椅，装饰着闪光的宝石。这把椅子比别的椅子高得多，椅子前面还有一只金色的小凳子做踏脚。这就是上帝在的时候坐的扶手椅，他一坐在这把椅子上，就能看见人间发生的一切事情。裁缝站着看这把椅子，默不作声地看了好一会儿，因为他喜欢它超过其他的一切。他终于控制不住自己的好奇心，便登上小凳子，在扶手椅上坐下。于是他看到人间发生的一切，看见一个丑陋的老太婆在一条溪边洗衣服，把两条纱巾藏起来。裁缝怒不可遏，抄起金脚凳从天上往人间扔下去打那个年老的女窃贼。可是他无法把金脚凳再收回来，便悄悄溜下扶手椅，仍旧回到门后面，坐在自己原先待着的地方，好像什么事情也没有发生似的。

上帝带着天堂的随从回来了，他虽然没看见门后的裁缝，但他坐上扶手椅时，发现踏脚凳没了。他问圣彼得脚凳哪儿去了，圣彼得也不知道。上帝又问他，放什么人进来没有。“除了一个裁缝，什么人我都我没放进来，”圣彼得回答说，“那是一个走路一瘸一拐的裁缝，他现在还在门后头待着。”上帝把裁缝叫到他跟前，问他有没有拿走凳子，拿到什么地方去了。“主啊，”裁缝高高兴兴地回答说，“我看见一个老太婆洗衣服的时候偷了两条纱巾，我很生气，就把凳子扔下去打她。”

“啊，你这无赖，”上帝说，“我要是像你这样审判，你早就该受惩罚了，我的椅子、凳子、扶手椅也早就没了，甚至连火钳也没了，统统都得扔下去打尘世的罪人了。你不能继续留在天堂，必须离开这里，到哪儿去，你看着办吧！这里除了我，谁都无权惩罚别人。”

圣彼得只好把裁缝带到天堂外面。裁缝因为鞋子破了，双脚净是水泡，就拿了一根棍子拄着，向“等候室”走去，里面坐着虔诚的士兵在玩乐。





自动上菜的小桌子、金驴子和跳出口袋的棍子


很久很久以前有一个裁缝，他有三个儿子和一只山羊。那只山羊，因为他们都吃它的奶，所以每天都得被牵到草地上去，吃很好的草料。儿子们轮流干这活。有一天，老大牵羊去教堂墓地，那里有许多鲜美的青草，他让羊儿吃草，自己在附近跳来跳去。傍晚该回家时，他问道：“羊儿，吃饱了没有？”羊儿回答：





我吃得很饱，

一片叶子也不再要，咩——咩——





“那就回家吧！”年轻人说，把它牵进羊圈拴牢了。“怎么样，”老裁缝问，“羊吃够草料没有？”

“哦，”老大回答说，“吃得很饱，它一片叶子也不想再吃了。”父亲要证实一下，自己到羊圈里来，他抚摸那可爱的山羊，问它：“羊儿，你吃饱了没有？”山羊回答说：





我怎么能吃饱？

我跳过几道小沟，

一片叶子也没见到，咩——咩——





“太不像话了！”裁缝大声喊叫起来，他跑上去对老大说：“喂，你这撒谎的家伙，你叫羊饿着，还说它吃饱了！”怒气冲冲地拿起墙上的尺子打他，把他赶跑了。

第二天轮到老二放羊，他在花园篱笆旁边找到一个地方，那儿的草长得很好，羊把草都吃光了。傍晚要回家时，他问：“羊儿，吃饱了没有？”羊儿回答：





我吃得很饱，

一片叶子也不再要，咩——咩——





“那就回家吧。”年轻人说，把它牵进羊圈拴牢了。“怎么样，”老裁缝说，“羊吃够草料没有？”

“哦，”老二回答说，“吃得很饱，它一片叶子也不想再吃了。”父亲不放心，自己到羊圈里来，他问：“羊儿，你吃饱了没有？”山羊回答说：





我怎么能吃饱？

我跳过几道小沟，

一片叶子也没见到，咩——咩——





“这个坏蛋！”裁缝大声喊叫，“让这么好的牲畜挨饿！”跑上去拿尺子打老二，把他赶出家门。

现在轮到第三个儿子放羊了，他要把事情办好，找了一处枝叶葱茏的灌木丛，让羊去吃。傍晚要回家时，他问：“羊儿，吃饱了没有？”羊儿回答：





我吃得很饱，

一片叶子也不再要，咩——咩——





“那就回家吧。”年轻人说，把它牵进羊圈拴牢了。“怎么样，”老裁缝说，“羊吃够草料没有？”

“哦，”老三回答说，“吃得很饱，它一片叶子也不想再吃了。”父亲信不过，自己到羊圈里来，他问：“羊儿，你吃饱了没有？”这阴险的畜生回答说：





我怎么能吃饱？

我跳过几道小沟，

一片叶子也没见到，咩——咩——





“啊，撒谎的混蛋！”裁缝大声喊叫，“一个个都这么坏，这么不负责任！你们再不能拿我当傻瓜了！”他气极了，跑上去拿尺子狠狠地抽可怜的小伙子的背，打得他只好从家里逃走。

现在就只剩老裁缝自己一个人和山羊在一起了。第二天早晨他去羊圈，对羊爱抚一番，说：“来，我可爱的小动物，我要亲自带你去吃草。”他牵羊去绿色篱笆那儿，去吃蓍草和羊平时爱吃的东西。“这回你可以随心所欲地吃个够了。”他对它说，让它吃草吃到傍晚。他问：“羊儿，吃饱了没有？”羊儿回答：





我吃得很饱，

一片叶子也不再要，咩——咩——





“那就回家吧。”裁缝说，把它牵进羊圈拴牢了。走了几步，又转过头来，说：“这回你可吃得够饱的了！”不料山羊对他也没好到哪里，叫道：





我怎么能吃饱？

我跳过几道小沟，

一片叶子也没见到，咩——咩——





裁缝一听，愣住了，也明白了他赶走三个儿子的无理。“等着瞧吧，”他喊叫着，“你这忘恩负义的畜生，赶走你还算便宜你了！我要给你做个记号，叫你没脸见正直的裁缝。”他匆忙跑上楼拿刮胡子刀，给山羊的头抹肥皂，把山羊头剃得像他的手掌一样没一根毛。他觉得用尺子揍它太赏它脸了，就去拿鞭子狠狠抽它，抽得它狂奔逃命。

裁缝孤孤单单待在家里，非常伤心，很想要他的儿子们回来，可是没人知道他们的下落。原来老大在一个细木匠那儿当学徒，他勤奋不懈地学习，满师以后，要去漫游，师傅送他一张小桌子。这张小桌子表面看上去并没有什么特别的地方，木头也是普普通通的木头，但是它有个很好的性能。你把它放好了，说：“小桌子，上菜吧！”这顶呱呱的小桌子马上就铺上干净的小台布，摆上一只盘子，旁边放置餐刀、叉子，还有几盘煎烤烧炖的菜肴、一大杯红葡萄酒，谁看了心里都会乐开花。年轻的木工心里想：“这够我受用一辈子了！”就高高兴兴地去各处漫游了，饭店好坏、有没有什么吃的，他都不放在心上。高兴时，他根本不进饭店，而是在田野上，在森林里，在草地上，高兴在哪儿就在哪儿，取下背上的小桌子，摆在面前，说：“上菜吧！”心里想吃什么，就都有了。他最后想回到父亲那里，他想父亲大概已经怒气全消，看到自动上菜的桌子，也许会很乐意接纳他。他在回家的途中，晚上来到一家客店，里面坐满了客人。他们招呼他，邀请他和他们一起吃，否则恐怕不容易得到什么吃的东西。“不用了，”细木匠回答说，“你们就这么点儿吃的东西，我怎么好意思吃呢？还是我请诸位吧！”他们哈哈大笑，以为他在和他们开玩笑。他在房间正中摆好他那张小木头桌子，说：“小桌子，上菜吧！”转眼间，桌上就摆满了客店老板拿不出来的香味扑鼻的美馔佳肴。“亲爱的朋友们，请用餐吧！”客人们看他真的请吃饭，也就不等他再说第二遍，都坐过来，举起刀叉狼吞虎咽起来。最使他们惊奇的是，一碗菜吃完了，马上又有满满的一碗自动上来。老板站在墙角看这玩意儿，不知该说什么好，心里想道：“我这客店倒很需要一个这样的厨师。”木匠和他的客人一直闹腾到深夜才上床睡觉，木匠将那神奇的小桌靠墙放着。老板睡不着，一个劲儿地转脑筋，忽然想起在他堆放破烂的小屋里有一张旧的小桌，样子和这张一模一样。他悄悄去取来，拿它调换神奇的小桌。第二天，木匠付了住宿费，收拾好桌子上路，根本想不到桌子被人调换了。中午时分，他回到父亲那里，父亲见他回来，非常高兴。“亲爱的孩子，你学了什么？”父亲对他说。

“爸爸，我是个细木匠了。”

“这手艺好啊，”父亲说，“你在各处漫游，带什么东西回来了？”

“爸爸，我带的最好的东西是这张桌子。”裁缝从各方面把小桌子打量一番，说：“你做的这张桌子可不是什么精品，这是一张又旧又差的小桌子。”

“这是一张自动上菜的桌子，”儿子回答说，“我把它放在地上，叫它上菜，桌上马上就会有很好的菜肴，还有令人开心的葡萄酒。你去请所有的亲朋好友来高高兴兴地美餐一顿吧，小桌子会让他们吃个够的。”客人来了，他把小桌子放在房间正中，说：“小桌子，上菜吧！”可是小桌子毫无动静，桌上什么东西也没有，和别的听不懂人话的桌子没什么两样。这时，可怜的木匠发现桌子被人调换了，站在那儿，羞愧难当，好像自己是个说谎话的人似的。亲友们取笑他一番，回家去了，什么也没吃，什么也没喝。父亲又拿出布料来继续做裁缝活，儿子去一个师傅那儿做工。

二儿子在一个磨坊主那儿当学徒。学徒期满时，师傅说：“你干得很好，我要送你一头特别的驴子，它不拉车，也不驮口袋。”

“那它究竟能派什么用场呢？”年轻人问。

“它会吐出金子，”磨坊主回答说，“你把它放在一块布上，嘴里念‘布列克勒布列特’，这顶好的牲口就会给你吐金币出来，前面后面一起吐。”

“是个好东西啊！”年轻人说，谢过师傅，就带上驴子去远游了。他需要金子的时候，只要对驴子说“布列克勒布列特”，金币就像雨一样落下来，他只需把它们捡起来就是了。无论他到哪里，总是要最好的东西，越是昂贵的，他越喜爱，因为他的钱袋总是满满的。他在各处看了一段时间以后，心里想：“得去看看父亲，带着这头金驴回去，他会忘了恼怒，好好待我的。”他来到把他哥哥的小桌子给调换了的那家客店，手里牵着驴子，老板要接过这牲口，把它拴起来，没想到年轻人说：“不麻烦你了，我自己把驴子牵去牲口棚拴着吧，我得知道它在哪儿。”店主认为一个需要自己照管驴子的人，吃不起多少东西，所以，当年轻人从口袋里掏出两块金币，要他只管把好酒好菜给他端来的时候，他好生奇怪，不由睁大了眼睛，跑去找他能搞到的最好的东西。吃完了饭，客人问该付多少钱，老板想多敲些竹杠，就说还得再给几个金币。年轻人一摸口袋，金币已经完了。“请稍等片刻，老板先生，”他说，“我去取了金币就来。”顺手把桌布带走。老板莫名其妙，心里好奇，悄悄跟在他后面。因为客人把牲口棚的门插上了，他就从门缝里偷看，只见客人把桌布铺在驴蹄下面，口念“布列克勒布列特”，这牲口就前面后面都吐出金子，金子雨点一般地落在地上。“哎呀呀，了不得，”老板说，“金币一会儿就铸好了！有这么个钱袋子倒是不赖啊！”客人付了钱，倒头就睡，老板却偷偷溜进牲口棚，牵走铸金币的能手，把另一头驴子拴在那儿。第二天一大早，年轻人牵了驴子就走，以为那就是他的金驴子。中午时分，他回到父亲家里，父亲见他回来，非常高兴。“你当了什么了，我的儿子？”老头子问。

“当了磨坊伙计，亲爱的爸爸。”他回答道。

“你在各处漫游，带什么东西回来了？”

“只有一头驴子，别的什么也没有。”

“驴子这里多的是，”父亲说，“要是有一只好山羊更好。”

“不错，”儿子回答说，“不过这不是一头普通的驴子，这是金驴子，我只要说一声‘布列克勒布列特’，这顶好的牲口就会在一块布上吐出一大堆金币。你去把所有的亲戚都请来，我要让他们都成为富翁。”

“这，我就太高兴了，”裁缝说，“以后我就不用那么辛苦地缝制衣服了。”他赶快跑去叫亲戚们来。他们一到齐，磨坊伙计就请他们让开点儿地方，在地上铺一块布，把驴子牵进房间。“现在请大家注意了！”他说完就念起“布列克勒布列特”，可是，掉下来的不是金币，并且这牲口根本不懂他那门艺术，因为不是每一头驴子都有那种本事。可怜的磨坊伙计拉长了脸，明白自己上当了，他请求亲戚们原谅，最后亲戚们走了，跟来的时候一样贫困。无奈，老头子只得又拿起针线，年轻人只得又去给一个磨坊主干活。

老三给一个车木师傅当学徒，因为这门手艺需要很高的技巧，所以他学习的时间要更长一些。他的两个哥哥写信告诉他说他们多么倒霉，客店老板如何在他们快到家的前一天晚上骗走了他们顶好的宝物。车木工学成后要去漫游，因为他做得很好，师傅送他一个口袋，说：“口袋里有一根短棍。”

“口袋我可以背着，对我很有用，短棍放在口袋里有什么用？只是增加分量罢了。”

“我这就告诉你，”师傅回答说，“如果有人欺负你，你只要说‘短棍，从口袋出来吧！’这短棍就会跳出来，跳到人们中间，兴高采烈地在他们背上跳舞，叫他们八天动弹不得，要等到你说‘短棍，回口袋里去吧！’它才停下。”小伙子谢过师傅，背起口袋走了。遇到有人侮辱他，要和他动手，他就说：“短棍，从口袋出来吧！”棍子就从口袋里跳出来，不管他们穿着外衣还是背心，没等他们脱下来，上去就一顿狠揍，而且速度很快，人家还没看清楚是怎么回事就挨揍了。黄昏时分，年轻的车木工来到他的两个哥哥受骗上当的那家客店。他把背包放在面前的桌子上，便讲开了他在各地看到的稀奇古怪的事情。“不错，”他说，“有人大概见到一张会自动上菜的小桌子、一头金驴子和诸如此类的东西：这些都是好玩意儿，我不小看它们，可是要跟我得到的、现在就在我口袋里的宝贝比起来，那都算不了什么。”老板竖起耳朵听着，“老天爷啊，这会是什么宝贝？”他想，“口袋里没准儿装的都是宝石，这东西也该归我，好事成三嘛！”到了睡觉的时候，客人在凳子上躺下，把他的口袋垫在脑袋底下当枕头。老板觉得客人睡熟了，走过去轻轻地小心翼翼地拉一下口袋，看能不能抽出来换上另一个枕头。车木工早就等着这一手，老板大着胆子正要偷梁换柱的当儿，车木工喊一声：“短棍，从口袋出来吧！”短棍马上跳出口袋，飞到老板身上，狠狠揍他，打得他大喊饶命。他叫喊得越响，短棍应和着他叫喊的节拍打他的背，打得越狠，最后他筋疲力尽，倒在地上。车木工问他：“你不交出自动上菜的小桌子和金驴子，就还得挨揍。”

“啊，别打了，”老板低声下气地说，“我心甘情愿退还所有的一切，只求你快让这魔棍回到口袋里去吧！”车木伙计说：“且饶你一回，你要使坏可得当心！”说罢，喊一声“短棍，回口袋里去吧！”让棍子歇歇。

第二天，车木工带着自动上菜的小桌子和金驴子回到父亲家里。裁缝又再见到儿子，非常高兴，问他在外地都学了些什么。“亲爱的爸爸，”他回答说，“我当了车木工了。”

“这是需要很高技术的手艺。”父亲说，“你在各处漫游，带什么东西回来了？”

“一件很贵重的东西，亲爱的爸爸，”儿子回答说，“一根短棍，在口袋里。”

“什么？!”父亲叫喊起来，“一根短棍！从哪棵树上都能砍一根短棍，还值得这么费事老远地带来！”

“这可不是那种普通的棍子，亲爱的爸爸，我一说‘短棍，从口袋出来吧’，棍子就跳出来，狠狠地打那个对我不怀好意的人，直打得他躺在地上求饶才罢休。那个客店老板偷走我哥哥们的自动上菜的小桌子和金驴子，你看，我用这棍子把这两样东西都要回来了。现在你把他们叫来，也把所有亲戚都请来，我要宴请他们，还要让他们的口袋装满黄金。”老裁缝真不敢相信，但他还是把亲戚们都请来了。车木工在房间里铺上一块布，把金驴子牵进来，对他的哥哥说：“亲爱的哥哥，现在你对它说吧！”磨坊工人说：“布列克勒布列特。”霎时间，金币像暴雨一般倾泻在布上，一直到大家再也拿不动了，金驴子才停止吐金币。（我看得出来，你也很想当时能在场。）之后，车木工拿出小桌子，说：“亲爱的哥哥，现在你对它说吧！”木匠刚说出：“小桌子，上菜吧！”桌子已经铺好，摆满了最漂亮的碗碟。善良的裁缝从来没在他家里办过这么丰盛的酒席，所有的亲戚都一起待到深夜，大家都非常快乐。裁缝把针线锁起来，把尺子和熨斗放在柜子里面，和他的三个儿子一起过着美满幸福的生活。

山羊哪里去了，那只使裁缝赶走他的儿子的有罪的山羊？我这就跟你讲。它被剃了光头，没脸见人，钻到狐狸的洞穴里躲了起来。狐狸回家时在黑暗中看见迎面一对亮闪闪的大眼睛，吓得转身就跑。遇见熊，狐狸很慌张，熊问道：“狐兄，你怎么了，脸色这么难看？”

“唉，”狐狸答道，“一只凶猛的野兽占据了我的洞穴，一对火眼直瞪着我。”

“咱们这就去把它赶跑。”熊说着和狐狸一起来到洞穴，往里面张望，见了那一双火眼，熊也胆怯，转身就跑，不想和那头恶兽打交道。蜜蜂遇见熊，看它神色不对，便说：“老熊，你满脸懊丧的样子，你的高兴劲儿丢到哪儿去了？”

“你说得轻巧，”熊回答说，“一头凶猛的野兽蹲在狐狸家里，我们没法子把它赶跑。”

“我很同情你，老熊，”蜜蜂说，“我是个可怜的弱小的生物，你们在路上都不肯正眼看我一下，可我相信我能帮你们的忙。”它飞进狐狸洞里，停在山羊剃得精光的脑袋上，狠狠蜇它，蜇得山羊跳起来，咩咩地狂叫着，发疯似地窜了出去，到现在谁也不知道它究竟跑到哪里去了。





死神教父


有一个穷人有十二个孩子，他得夜以继日地工作，才能养活他们。当他的第十三个孩子出生时，他想不出什么办法能摆脱困境，就跑到大路上去，想找他遇到的第一个人当教父。他遇到的第一个人是上帝。上帝已经知道他的心事，对他说：“可怜的人啊，我同情你，我要给你的孩子行洗礼，我要照顾他，使他在人间生活幸福。”

穷人说：“你是谁？”

“我是上帝。”

“那我就不请你做教父了，”那人说，“你只把好处给富人，让穷人挨饿。”穷人这么说，因为他不知道上帝把财富和贫困分配得多么明智。于是他从上帝那儿走开了。

这时魔鬼向他走过来，说：“你寻找什么？如果你愿意让我做你的孩子的教父，我要给他很多很多金子，还给他世上所有的快乐。”

穷人问：“你是谁？”

“我是魔鬼。”

“那我就不请你做教父了，”那人说，“你欺骗人，还诱惑人。”他继续走，这时，瘦腿的死神向他大步走来，说：“让我做教父吧！”

“你是谁？”

“我是死神，我对所有人一视同仁。”

穷人说：“你正合适，你带走富人，也带走穷人，不厚此薄彼，就请你做教父吧！”

死神回答说：“我要让你的孩子富有并且出名，谁和我交朋友，亏待不了他。”

穷人说：“下星期天就行洗礼，你要准时来。”死神果然去了，堂堂皇皇地当了教父。

男孩长大了，有一天，教父来叫他一起出去，把他带到森林里，指给他看生长在那儿的一种草，说：“现在要你领受教父送你的礼物。我要让你成为一位著名的医生。如果你去给一个病人看病，每次你总能见到我。如果我站在病人脑袋旁边，你就尽管说，你能让他恢复健康，给他一些这种草药，他就好了；如果我站在病人的脚边，这人就是我的，你就得说，什么办法都没用了，世界上没有一个医生能救活他。但是你要当心，不许违背我的意志乱用药，否则你就要遭殃。”

不久，年轻人就成了世上最著名的医生了。“他只要看一下病人，就知道病情如何，知道病人能够恢复健康，还是必死无疑。”人们都这样谈论他，从老远的地方来请他去给病人看病，给他很多金子，不久，他就成了富翁。有一次，国王病了，叫他去问能不能治好。他来到病床前，看见死神站在病人脚边，病人必死无疑了。“我骗一下死神，”医生心里这样想，“他自然会恼火，不过我是他的教子，他会睁一只眼闭一只眼的。我要冒一次险。”他便抱起病人，把他调转过来，这样，死神就在他的脑袋旁边了。他又给他一些草药，国王经过调养，恢复了健康。死神来找医生，面色阴沉凶狠，用手指指着他威胁道：“你欺骗我！这一次我饶了你，因为你是我的教子。但是，如果你胆敢再愚弄我，我就要你的命。”

过不多久，国王的女儿得了重病。国王就只有这个孩子，他日夜哀哭，哭瞎了双眼。他下令宣布：谁能医治好她的病，就招他为驸马，并且让他继承王位。医生来到公主的床前，看见死神站在公主脚边。他本应记得他的教父的警告，可是公主的非凡美貌和做她的丈夫的福分使他迷了心窍，把一切顾虑全都抛到九霄云外去了。他顾不上看死神向他投去的愤怒的目光和高高地举起来威胁他的干枯的拳头，把公主抱起来，把她的头放在她的双脚原先的位置，再给了她一些草药。公主很快变得双颊红润，重新获得了生命的活力。

死神发现自己第二次受骗，大步流星地向医生走去，说：“你完蛋了，现在轮到你了。”说着，用他那冷冰冰的手牢牢抓住医生，医生无法反抗，只好随着他下地狱。在那里，他看见万点烛光，一排排望不到尽头，有的光点很大，有的不大不小，有的很小。每时每刻都有一些烛光熄灭，又有一些点燃起来，看上去好像小火焰在不停地跳过来跳过去似的。“你看，”死神说，“这就是人类的生命之火。大的烛光是属于孩子们的，不大不小的是中年夫妇们的，小的烛光是白发老人的。不过有些孩子和年轻人的烛光很小，也是常有的事。”

“告诉我，哪个是我的烛光？”医生说，心里以为他的生命的烛光还挺大。死神指着一小截快烧完了的蜡烛头说：“你看，这就是。”

“啊，教父，”医生吓坏了，说，“给我点一支新的吧，求求你，让我能享受生活，做国王，做美丽的公主的丈夫。”

“我不能，”死神回答说，“得先有一支蜡烛熄灭，才能点一支新的。”

“那就把旧的接在新的上面，旧的点完了，新的接着点。”医生请求说。死神做出愿意满足他的愿望的样子，拿了一支新点燃的大蜡烛过来，但他为了报复，在接蜡烛的时候故意让那蜡烛头掉下去熄灭了。医生立马栽倒在地上，他自己落到死神手里了。





六只天鹅


有一天，一个国王在一座大森林里打猎，他兴致勃勃地追逐一只猎物，他的随从都被他抛在了后面。夜晚来临，他停下环顾四周，发现自己迷路了。这时他看见一个老太婆摇晃着脑袋向他走过来。这是一个巫婆。“亲爱的太太，”他对她说，“你能告诉我怎么走出这森林吗？”

“啊，没问题，国王陛下，”她回答说，“我可以告诉你，不过有一个条件如果你不能答应我，你就永远无法走出森林，只能饿死在这里。”

“请问是什么条件？”国王问。

“我有一个女儿，”老太婆说，“她很漂亮，世上很难再找到第二个像她这么漂亮的女子，她完全配得上做你的妻子。如果你愿意娶她做王后，我就指给你走出森林的路。”

国王心里害怕，就答应了。老太婆领国王到她的小屋，她的女儿就坐在屋子里的火炉旁边。她迎接国王，好像她正等待他到来。他看出她很漂亮，但是并不喜欢她，他注视她的时候，心里总暗暗感到恐惧。他把这姑娘抱上马后，老太婆给他指路，国王回到王宫，举行了婚礼。

国王曾经结过一次婚，他的第一个妻子生了七个孩子，六个男孩和一个女孩。国王爱他的孩子超过世上的一切。现在他担心继母会虐待他们，就把他们送到森林深处一座孤零零的宫殿里去住。这宫殿的位置非常隐蔽，很难找到，如果不是一个聪明的女人送给他一个神奇的线团，他自己也无法找到。他把这线团往面前一扔，那团线就自己展开，为他指引道路。国王经常去探望他的孩子们，这引起了王后的注意。她很好奇，想知道国王独自一人去森林里究竟干些什么。她给他的侍从们很多钱，他们向她泄漏了那个秘密，并且告诉她只有那团线能指明道路。她心中无法平静，直至探明国王把那线团保存在什么地方，然后她做了几件白绸子小衬衣，把一种魔力缝到了里面去。原来她跟她母亲学过巫术。一次，国王出去打猎，她就带上小衬衣走进了森林，线团给她带路。孩子们远远地看见有人来，以为是他们亲爱的父亲来看望他们，兴高采烈地跑来迎接。她往他们头上每人扔过去一件小衬衣，小衬衣一碰着他们的身体，他们就变成了天鹅，越过森林上空飞走了。王后快活地回家，以为国王前妻的孩子都被她处置了。可是那女孩没有和她的哥哥们一起跑去迎接，王后对她一无所知。第二天，国王回来，要去看望他的孩子们，但他只见到小姑娘一个人。“你的哥哥们呢？”国王问。

“啊，亲爱的父亲，”她回答说，“他们到别处去了，只留下我一个人在这里。”她向国王叙述她的哥哥们如何变成天鹅，从森林上空飞走，她让国王看她在院子里捡到的他们掉下的羽毛。国王非常难过，但他没想到这坏事是王后干的。他担心小姑娘也会给掳走，要带她一同回去。但她害怕继母，便请求国王允许她再留在森林里过一个夜晚。

可怜的姑娘心里想：“我不能在这里久留，我要去找我的哥哥们。”黑夜降临，她向森林深处走去，走了一整夜，第二天继续走，一直走到累得再也走不动了。她看见山坡上有一个小屋，她爬上去，发现一间小房间，里面有六张小床，但她不敢躺在小床上，而是爬到一张小床下面，躺在坚硬的地面上，想在那里过夜。夕阳快要西沉的时候，她听见一阵风声，看见六只天鹅从窗外飞进来。天鹅们落在地上，互相往身上吹气，吹掉身上所有的羽毛，身上的天鹅皮就像一件衬衣一样脱下来了。小姑娘望着他们，认出是她的哥哥们，非常高兴，就从床下爬出来。哥哥们见了小妹妹，也非常高兴，但他们的欢乐为时短暂。“你不能在这里久留，”他们对小妹妹说，“这是一个强盗窝，他们回来一发现你，就会把你杀掉。”

“你们就不能保护我吗？”小妹妹问。

“不能，”他们回答说，“因为我们每天晚上只有一刻钟时间能脱掉天鹅皮，恢复人形，过了这一刻钟我们就又变成天鹅了。”小姑娘哭了，她说：“那你们就没法解脱了吗？”

“啊，难啊，”他们回答说，“我们变回人形条件非常苛刻，那就是，六年的时间里，你不许说话，不许笑，在这段时间里你还得为我们用紫箢缝制六件小衬衣。只要从你的嘴里说出一个字，就前功尽弃。”哥哥们说完这话，一刻钟的时间已经过去，他们又变成天鹅飞出了窗外。

但是小姑娘下了坚定的决心，即使付出生命的代价，也要拯救她的哥哥们。她离开小屋，走到密林深处，爬到一棵树上坐下来，在那里度过一夜。第二天早晨，她出去采集紫箢，开始缝衣。她不可以和任何人说话，她也没有兴致笑，她坐在那儿，专心致志地工作。她在那里度过了很长时间。有一天，那个国家的国王到这森林里打猎，国王的猎人们来到姑娘坐着的那棵树下。他们大声问她：“你是谁？”但她不回答。“你下来吧，”他们说，“我们不会欺负你的！”她只是摇头，仍不开口。猎人们继续问她，她把她的金项链扔下来给他们，心里想，这样他们就会满足了。可是他们仍不罢休。她又把她的腰带扔给他们，还是无济于事。她又扔下她的袜带，就这样把身上穿戴的一件一件扔下去，最后只剩下一件小衬衣。猎人们仍不肯走，他们爬到树上，把姑娘抱下来，带她到国王跟前。国王问：“你是谁？你在树上做什么？”她不回答。国王用他会的所有语言问她，她始终像鱼一样默不作声。但她很美丽，国王动心了，深深地爱上了她。他用他的大衣裹着她的身体，把她抱上他的马，带她回宫。他让人给她穿上华丽的衣裳，她容光焕发、光彩照人，但她一句话也不说。他把她抱起来放在桌旁，和他坐在一起，他非常喜爱她那谦逊文静的仪态，他说：“我就要娶你，除了你，世上任何人我都不娶。”几天以后，他和她结婚了。

国王的母亲是个凶狠的老婆子，她不满意这桩婚事，说年轻的王后的坏话。“谁知道这丫头是哪里来的，”她说，“话也不会说，她配不上国王。”一年后，王后生了第一个孩子，老婆子把孩子抱走，趁王后熟睡时在她嘴唇涂抹上血迹，接着跑去向国王告状，说她是个吃人精。国王不信，不能容忍别人伤害她。她还是一直坐着缝制小衬衣，对其他事情一概不闻不问。第二年，王后又生了一个漂亮的男孩，虚伪的婆婆又故伎重演，国王难以决断是否应该相信他母亲的话。他说：“她极为虔诚而善良，不致于做出这种事来。她不会说话，无法为自己辩护，否则她必定能证明自己是清白无辜的。”可是，当老婆子第三次偷走初生的婴儿，又去告王后的状的时候，王后还是没有说一句话为自己辩白，国王很无奈，只好把她交给法庭，法庭判处用烈火将她处死。

执行处决的那一天，同时也就是不许她说话不许她笑的六年的最后一天，她即将把她亲爱的哥哥们从巫术的魔力中解救出来。六件小衬衣缝制好了，只是最后一件小衬衣还缺左边的袖子。她被带上火刑场的柴堆时，她把那些小衬衣放在胳膊上，快要点火的时候，她站在柴堆上举目环顾，只见六只天鹅破空飞来。她知道她获救的时刻临近了，她的心儿激动、欢欣。天鹅嗖嗖地向她飞来，低低地围在她身旁，让她能把衬衣抛给它们。它们一碰到衬衣，身上的天鹅皮就掉了，她的哥哥们一个个恢复了人形，生气勃勃而又英俊，只有最小的哥哥还缺左臂，背上长着一只天鹅的翅膀。他们互相拥抱、亲吻。国王十分惊愕，王后走到国王跟前，开口说：“亲爱的丈夫，现在我可以说话了，我要向你说明：我被人诬告了，我是清白无辜的。”她向他揭穿老婆子的谎言，是她抱走她的三个孩子，把他们藏了起来。孩子们被送到了国王那里，国王很高兴。恶婆婆受到了惩罚，她被送到柴堆上烧成灰烬。国王、王后和王后的六个哥哥一起幸福安宁地生活了很多很多年。





玫瑰公主


从前有一个国王和一个王后，他们天天讲：“啊，我们要是有个孩子，那该多好！”却总是没有孩子。有一天，王后洗澡，一只青蛙从水里爬上陆地，对她说：“你的愿望就要实现了，要不了一年，你就会生个女孩。”

青蛙的话果然应验了。不久，王后生了个非常美丽的女孩，国王高兴得简直不知该怎么办好。他举办一个盛大的宴会，不仅邀请所有亲戚、朋友和熟人前来赴宴，还邀请了女预言家，希望她们能喜欢这个孩子，对她多多关照。他的王国有十三位女预言家，但他只有十二只金盘子可供她们就餐时使用，因此，只好让一位女预言家留在家里。

宴会非常豪华，将近结束时，女预言家们赠送给孩子神奇的礼物：第一个赠送她品德，第二个赠送她美貌，第三个赠送财富……赠送的都是世人期盼的东西。

第十一个女预言家刚说完她的赠言，第十三个女预言家突然走了进来。国王没请她赴宴，她要报复，她跟谁都不打招呼，也不看任何人，一进来就大声说：“我要让公主在十五岁那年被纺锤扎伤，倒下去死掉。”她没再说别的话，转身离开大厅。

大家都吓坏了，这时，还没有说出她的祝愿的第十二个女预言家走了出来，因为她无法取消第十三个预言家的咒语，只能使它减轻，便说：“但公主不会死，而是熟睡一百年。”

国王竭力保护他的心爱的孩子免遭不幸，下令焚毁全国所有纺锤。女预言家的祝福在这女孩子身上一一应验了，她长得那么美丽、文静，聪明而又善解人意，谁见了她都很喜爱她。

在她刚满十五岁那一天，国王和王后不在家，只有公主自己一个人留在宫中。她到各处走动，随心所欲观看宫中大大小小的房间，最后来到一座古老的塔楼。她登上狭窄的旋转楼梯，走到一扇小门前面，钥匙眼里插着一把生锈的钥匙，她一转钥匙，门开了，小房间里坐着一个老婆婆，手里拿着纺锤在勤快地纺麻线。“你好，老妈妈，”公主说，“你在做什么啊？”

“我在纺线。”老婆婆点点头。

“那是什么东西转得那么欢？”姑娘说着，拿起纺锤，也想纺一纺试试。可是她刚刚碰着纺锤，魔咒就应验了，纺锤扎了她的手指。

就在她感觉扎着手指的一瞬间，她倒在旁边的床上，沉睡了过去，睡得很深沉。这深沉的睡眠笼罩了整个宫殿。国王和王后回家，刚刚踏进大殿，马上就睡着了，宫中的臣仆也都和他们一起沉睡了。马厩里的马匹、宫里的狗、屋顶的鸽子、墙上的苍蝇，甚至连炉灶里面燃烧的火焰，都静静地睡着了，正在油炸的肉也不嗞嗞响了，厨房的小帮工做错点事，大师傅正要揪他的头发，这时也松开手自己睡着了。风停了，王宫前面的树上，再没有一片树叶动一下。

王宫周围开始生长出一片荆棘，那荆棘年年长高，终于包围了整座王宫，甚至长到把王宫整个都遮盖起来，连屋顶上的旗子也看不见了。国中流行着关于美丽的沉睡的玫瑰公主的传说，人们这样称呼她，于是不时有些王子想要穿越荆棘树篱进入王宫。但是他们无法进去，因为那些荆棘好像长着许多手，紧紧拉着，把年轻人缠在里面，使他们无法脱身，一个个悲惨地死去。许多许多年以后，有一天，又有一位王子来到这个王国。他听一个老年人说起荆棘树篱，说荆棘后面有一座王宫，里面有一位人称玫瑰公主的绝色美人，已经沉睡百年，国王和王后以及所有朝臣也都和她一起沉睡了。那老人听他爷爷说已有许多王子前来，试图穿越荆棘，却都被荆棘绊住，死得非常悲惨。那年轻人说：“我不怕，我要去看望美丽的玫瑰公主。”好心的老人无论怎么劝他别去，他都不听。



但这时正好过去了一百年，玫瑰公主睡醒的日子来到了。王子走近荆棘树篱的时候，那里尽是硕大的美丽的鲜花，它们自动分开，让他通过，他一点儿也没有受到伤害。他走过去后，鲜花又变成荆棘，合围起来。他在宫中看见马匹和花斑猎狗躺在庭院睡觉，鸽子蹲在屋顶，把头儿藏在翅膀底下。他登入厅堂，看见苍蝇在墙上睡着，厨房里的厨师还伸出手做要抓那小帮工的模样，婢女坐着，她跟前是一只正待拔毛的黑母鸡。

他继续往前走，看见宫中所有臣仆都睡倒在殿堂上，国王和王后躺在王座上睡觉。

他又继续往前走，一切是那么寂静，静得人都能听得见自己的呼吸。他终于来到塔楼，打开小屋那扇门，公主睡在里面，她躺着，那么美丽，他无法把目光移向别处。他弯下腰来吻她。这一吻，玫瑰公主醒来了，她睁开眼睛，非常温柔地望着他。

他们一起走下来，国王醒了，王后醒了，宫中所有臣仆瞪大了眼睛彼此对视。庭院里的马匹站起来，晃动身体，猎狗摇着尾巴跳来跳去，屋顶上的鸽子把头从翅膀下伸出来四下张望，向着田野飞去，墙上的苍蝇继续爬着，厨房里的火苗又燃烧起来煮食物，油锅里的炸肉又嗞嗞响起来，大师傅一个耳光打得小帮工连声叫喊，婢女拔完了母鸡毛。

王子和公主举行盛大豪华的婚礼，他们快乐地度过了一生。





白雪公主


有一年冬天，雪花像羽毛从天上飘落下来。一位王后坐在乌檀木框的窗前做针线活。她一边缝，一边抬眼望着雪花，针扎破手指，流了三滴血，滴在雪地上。白雪衬着血红，分外美丽，她心里暗想：“要是我有个孩子，像雪那么洁白，像血那么鲜红，像乌檀木窗框那么乌黑，那该多好！”

不久，她生了一个女儿，果然肌肤雪白，双唇鲜红，头发乌黑像乌檀木，大家都称呼她白雪公主。孩子出生后，王后就去世了。

一年多以后，国王又娶了一个王后。这是个漂亮的女人，可是很骄横傲慢，不能容忍别人比她美丽。她有一面魔镜，她一走到魔镜前面照镜子，就说：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子就回答：





王后，您是全国最漂亮的女子。





她听了十分满意，因为她知道，镜子说的是实话。

白雪公主一天天长大，越长越漂亮。到她七岁的时候，她像晴朗的白昼一样美丽，比王后还要漂亮。有一天，王后问镜子：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子回答：





王后，这里的女子数您最美，

但白雪公主比您还美千百倍。





王后一听大吃一惊，因为妒忌，脸色变得很难看。从此一见白雪公主，她的心就在身体里面翻腾个不停，她对这小女孩恨得要死。忌妒和厌恶像野草一样在她心里越长越高，使她日夜不得安宁。她叫来一个猎人，说：“把这个孩子带到森林里去，我不要再看见她。你要杀了她，带回她的肝和肺给我作凭证。”猎人遵命，带走白雪公主。当他抽出长猎刀，正要刺穿孩子纯洁的心的时候，公主哭泣着说：“哎呀，亲爱的猎人，饶我一命吧！我一定跑到荒野的森林里去，永远不再回家。”白雪公主长得那么美，猎人非常同情她，就说：“可怜的孩子，你快逃跑吧！”猎人心里想，过不了多久，这孩子就会给野兽吃掉的。但他觉得好像心里一块石头落地了，因为他用不着亲手杀死她了。恰巧这时有一只小野猪跑过来，猎人把它刺死，掏出肝和肺，带回去给王后作为凭证。这个歹毒的女人叫厨师把它们加盐煮了，然后自己统统吃掉，自以为吃的是白雪公主的肝和肺。

可怜的白雪公主孤零零独自一人走在大森林里，心里非常害怕，望着树上的树叶，不知如何是好。她拔腿就跑，越过尖尖的石头，穿过荆棘丛，野兽从她身边跑过去，但是都不伤害她。她只要还能挪动双腿，就不停地奔跑，一直跑到天快黑了。这时，她看见一座小巧的房子，就进去休息。小屋里一切都很小，但很精致、清洁，无可挑剔。那里有一张铺着白桌布的小桌子，桌上有七只小碟，每只小碟都配有小勺，另外还有七把小刀、七把小叉和七只小酒杯。沿墙并排七张小床，都铺着雪白的床单。

白雪公主又饥又渴，她从每只小碟里各拿一点儿蔬菜和面包吃，从每只小酒杯里喝一滴葡萄酒：因为她不愿意把哪个人的东西全都吃光。在这之后，她已经十分疲倦了，想在小床上躺下，可是哪一张小床都不合适，不是太长，就是太短，最后那第七张小床对她刚合适。她躺在小床上，说了声“上帝保佑”就睡着了……

天完全黑了，小屋的主人回来了，那是在山里挖矿的七个小矮人。他们点着七盏小灯，小屋顿时被照得亮堂堂的，他们发现有人来过，因为屋里不是一切都跟他们离开时一模一样。

第一个人说：“谁坐过我的小椅子？”

第二人说：“谁吃了我小碟子里的东西？”

第三个说：“谁吃了点儿我的小面包？”

第四个说：“谁吃了点儿我的蔬菜？”

第五个说：“谁用了我的小叉？”

第六个说：“谁喝了点儿我酒杯里的酒？”

接着，第一个矮人环视周围，发现他的床凹下去了一点儿，就说：“谁在我的床上躺过？”其他人都跑过来，大声说：“我的床也有人躺过！”第七个小矮人瞥一眼他的床，发现白雪公主躺在床上睡得正香。他喊其他人，他们跑过来，举起七盏灯照着白雪公主，惊奇得叫起来。“哎呀，我的上帝！哎呀，我的上帝！”他们大声说，“这么漂亮的孩子！”他们非常高兴，便不唤醒她，让她在床上继续睡觉。第七个小矮人睡在伙伴们的床上，在每个伙伴床上睡一小时，黑夜就过去了。

早晨，白雪公主醒来，看见七个小矮人，她感到害怕。但小矮人们待她很和气，问她：“你叫什么名字？”

“我叫白雪公主。”她回答。

“你是怎么到我们这里来的？”小矮人们接着问。

她把继母派人要杀死她，猎人放她逃命，她跑了一整天，最后才找到他们的房子的事跟他们讲了一遍。

小矮人们说：“如果你愿意替我们看护房子、洗衣做饭、铺床叠被、缝补编织，愿意把一切都收拾得干干净净、整整齐齐，你可以在我们这里住下去，我们不会亏待你的。”

“好的，”白雪公主说，“我打心眼里愿意留在这里！”于是就在他们那儿住下来。

她替他们把一个家料理得井井有序：早晨他们进矿找金子，晚上回来，饭菜就都准备好了。白天小女孩独自一人待在家里，好心的小矮人告诫她说：“要提防你的继母，她很快就会知道你在这里的。不要让外人进来，不论是谁。”

王后吃了自认为是白雪公主的肝和肺以后，满以为自己又成了最尊贵最美丽的女人了，她走到镜子前面说：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子回答：





王后，这里的女子数您最美，

但白雪公主在山里，

在七个小矮人那里，

她比您还美千百倍。





王后大吃一惊，因为她知道魔镜不说假话，她知道自己被猎人骗了，白雪公主还活着。于是她左思右想，怎样去杀害白雪公主。因为，只要她不是全国最美的美人，她就会由于忌妒而不得安宁。

后来她想出了个主意，在脸上涂抹些颜色，扮作一个年老的小商贩，让人认不出她来。

她翻过七座山，到了七个小矮人的家，敲门喊叫：“卖漂亮的东西！卖漂亮的东西！”

白雪公主从窗口张望，大声说：“你好，亲爱的太太！你卖什么东西？”

“好东西，漂亮的东西，”她回答说，“各种颜色的腰带。”说着就取出一条彩色丝带。

“可以让这个诚实的女人进来。”白雪公主想，就开门要买美丽的带子。



“孩子，”那老婆子说，“看你成个什么模样了！来，我给你好好扎一扎。”白雪公主一点儿也不起疑心，她走上前去，让她替她系上新带子。老婆子又快又狠地把白雪公主捆绑得结结实实，她喘不过气来，昏死过去了。“现在你只能算曾经是最美丽的女子了！”老婆子说罢，匆匆跑出去。

过不多久，快到晚上了，七个小矮人回到家里，看见他们亲爱的白雪公主躺在地上，一动不动，死人似的，全都吓坏了。他们把她抬起来，看她被绑得太紧，就把带子剪断。白雪公主开始微微喘气，慢慢地又活过来了。小矮人们听她讲了事情经过，都说：“做小买卖的老太婆不是别人，正是那个恶毒的王后。你要当心，我们不在家的时候，谁也别让进来！”

那凶恶的女人回到家里就去照镜子，问：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子的回答还跟以前一样：





王后，这里的女子数您最美，

但白雪公主在山里，

在七个小矮人那里，

她比您还美千百倍。





她一听这话，吓出了一身冷汗，因为她清楚地看到白雪公主又活过来了。“走着瞧吧，”她说，“我要想出个办法叫你完蛋！”她会巫术，就施巫术做了一把有毒的梳子，然后又乔装打扮成另一个老婆子。她爬过七座山，来到七个小矮人的家，敲门喊叫：“卖好东西啦！卖好东西啦！”

白雪公主望着窗外说：“走远点，我不许任何人进来！”

“你看看总可以吧！”老婆子说着，取出毒梳子，举得高高的。小姑娘很喜爱这把梳子，受到诱惑，把门打开了。谈好了买卖，老婆子说：“我给你好好梳一梳吧！”可怜的白雪公主想也不想一下，就让老婆子梳头。那梳子一插进头发丝，毒性发作，小姑娘便失去知觉，栽倒在了地上。“最美的美人，”这个恶毒的女人说，“现在你可完蛋了。”说罢，拔腿就走了。

幸亏不多久已是傍晚，七个小矮人回家了。他们一见白雪公主死人似的躺在地上，马上怀疑是她的继母害的，仔细检查一番，很快便发现了那把毒梳子。他们把梳子拔出来，白雪公主就又苏醒过来，讲了事情的经过。小矮人又一次告诫她千万小心，无论谁来都不要开门。

王后在家里走到魔镜跟前问道：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子的回答依然如故：





王后，这里的女子数您最美，

但白雪公主在山里，

在七个小矮人那里，

她比您还美千百倍。





她听见镜子这么说，气得浑身发抖。“一定要叫白雪公主死，”她大声喊叫，“即使要付出我自己的生命作代价！”她随即走进一间十分隐蔽的密室，那个房间是别人不许进去的，她在那里制作一只有毒的苹果。这苹果外表非常漂亮，谁看了都会馋涎欲滴，可是只要咬一小口，必定丧命。苹果做好了，她在脸上涂抹些颜色，改扮成一个农妇，翻过七座山，来到七个小矮人的住处。她敲门，白雪公主把头伸出窗外，说：“我不能让人进屋，七个小矮人不允许！”

“我也不想进屋，”农妇说，“我的苹果快卖完了。这只苹果送给你吃吧。”

“不，”白雪公主说，“我不能接受任何东西！”

“你怕有毒吗？”老婆子说，“你看，我把苹果切成两半，你吃红的那一半，我吃白的那一半。”那苹果是做成只有红的那一半有毒的。白雪公主早就馋那漂亮的苹果，一看农妇吃上了，再也忍耐不住，就伸出手去接过有毒的那半个苹果。张嘴刚咬一口，她就跌倒在地上死了。王后用恶毒的目光把她打量一番，哈哈大笑，说：“肌肤雪白，双唇血红，头发乌黑像黑檀木！这一回小矮人可没法让你再醒过来了。”

到了家里，她问镜子：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子终于回答：





王后，您是全国最美的美人。





她那颗忌妒的心获得了最大的安宁。

晚上，小矮人们回家，发现白雪公主躺在地上，已经没有呼吸，她死了。他们把她抬起来，检查是不是哪儿有什么有毒的东西，松开她的衣带，给她梳理头发，用清水和葡萄酒给她洗浴，但这一切都无济于事，可爱的小姑娘死了，死了！他们把她放在一副担架上，七个小矮人守在担架旁，为她的死伤心痛哭，哭了三天三夜。要埋葬她了，可她显得仍然像活人那么清新，脸颊依然美丽红润。他们说：“我们不能把她埋在黑色土地里。”于是他们定做了一口无论从哪个方位都能看得见她的透明的玻璃棺材，把她放在里面。玻璃棺上用金色字母写着她的名字，以让人知道这是一位公主，然后他们把棺材运到山上。无论何时，七个小矮人中总有一人守在玻璃棺旁。动物也来哀悼白雪公主，最先来的是一只猫头鹰，接着是一只鹿，最后飞来一只鸽子。

白雪公主在棺材里躺了很久很久，她不腐烂，看上去像是在睡觉，因为她依旧肌肤洁白似雪，双唇鲜红如血，头发像黑檀木一样乌黑。

后来有一位王子在森林里迷了路，到小矮人的小屋过夜。他在山上见过那口玻璃棺材和棺材里美丽的白雪公主，读了棺材上用烫金字母写的话。他对小矮人们说：“把玻璃棺材给我吧，你们要什么，我都可以给你们。”但是小矮人们回答说：“把世界上的黄金都给我们也不行。”

王子说：“那么你们就把它送给我吧，因为，看不见白雪公主，我就没法活下去，我一定像尊敬我最亲爱的人那样尊敬她。”

他说得非常诚恳，善良的小矮人们被打动了，就把玻璃棺材送给了他。王子让他的侍从把棺材抬在肩上运走。碰巧他们给灌木绊了一跤，一颠，白雪公主咬下的那一口有毒的苹果从喉咙里蹦出来了。没过多久，她睁开眼睛，托起玻璃棺盖，坐了起来。她又活过来了。“啊，上帝啊，这是什么地方？”她大声说。

王子非常快乐地说：“你和我在一起。”他讲了事情的经过，说：“我喜欢你超过世上的一切。和我一起到我父亲的王宫去吧，我要娶你做我的妻子。”白雪公主很喜欢他，便随他前往，他们的婚礼安排得又隆重又豪华。

白雪公主的那个恶毒的继母也被邀请参加婚礼。她穿上漂亮的衣裳，走到魔镜前面说：





小镜子啊，墙上的镜子，

谁是全国最漂亮的女子？





镜子回答：





王后，这里的女子数您最美，

但年轻的王后比您还美千百倍。





这个恶毒的女人大声咒骂了一句，她心里非常害怕，不知该怎么办好。起初她真不想去参加婚礼，可是心里总不得安宁，她无论如何要去看一看年轻的王后。她一进去，就认出那是白雪公主，吓得站在那里动弹不得。这时，铁钳子夹着铁鞋早已架在炭火上，摆在她的面前。她必须套上烧红的铁鞋跳舞，一直跳到跌倒在地上死去。





金鸟


古代有一个国王，他的宫殿后面有一座美丽的花园，园中有一棵能结出金苹果的树。苹果熟了的时候，是数了数的，可是第二天就发现少了一只。国王得到报告，下令每天夜里都要有人在树下看守。国王有三个儿子，夜幕降临时，他派大儿子到花园去，半夜时分，他熬不住睡着了，第二天早晨又少了一只苹果。第二夜该二儿子去看守，他也好不了多少：钟敲十二点时，他睡着了，早上发现又少了一只苹果。现在轮到第三个儿子了，他也做好了准备，但国王不怎么信得过他，以为他可能还不如他的两个哥哥；不过最终还是准许他去了。这年轻人躺在树下，他醒着，不让睡意控制自己。钟敲十二下时，他听见空中传来“嗖嗖”的响声，月光下看见飞来一只鸟儿，浑身羽毛金光闪耀。鸟儿落在树上，它正要啄下一只苹果，年轻人向它射了一箭。鸟飞走了，但那支箭射中它的羽毛，一根金羽毛落到地上。年轻人把它捡起来，第二天送去给国王看，向他讲述夜间看到的情景。国王召集他的大臣，人人都说像这样的羽毛一根就比整个王国还要宝贵。“既然这羽毛这么珍贵，”国王宣称，“只有一根远远不够，我要整只金鸟，无论如何都要得到它！”

于是大王子启程去找金鸟，他自以为很聪明，找到它不成问题。他走了一段路，看见一只狐狸蹲在森林边上，他举起火枪向它瞄准。狐狸大叫：“别开枪，我要给你出个好主意。你要去找金鸟，今天晚上你将走到一个村庄，那儿有两家客店彼此隔街相对。一家灯火明亮、热闹非凡，这一家你可别进去，要进另一家客店，虽然它看起来破败、冷清。”

“这么愚蠢的畜生还能给我出什么好主意！”王子心里想着，就扣动扳机，但没打中，狐狸竖起尾巴飞快跑进森林。王子一路走下去，傍晚来到两家客店隔街相望的村子，一家客店里有人在唱歌跳舞，另一家却冷冷清清，一副寒碜相。“要是放着这家热闹的客店不住，”他想，“去住那穷酸客店，我就真是个傻瓜了。”他便走进那家热闹的客店，在那里花天酒地，把金鸟儿、父王和所有忠告、教诲统统忘了。

过了一段时日，左等右等，总不见大儿子回来，二王子就启程去寻找金鸟。他像大王子一样，也遇见了狐狸，狐狸给他出个好主意，但他听不进去。他走近那两家客店，他哥哥站在传出喧嚣声的那家客店窗前呼唤他。他抵挡不住诱惑，便进去尽情享乐。

又过了一段时间，小王子也要出去试试运气，父亲不让他去。“这是白费力气，”他说，“他还不如他哥哥，怎么能找到金鸟？要是遇上什么不幸，他也毫无办法；三兄弟就数他最无能。”但国王被他吵得心神不宁，最后也只好让他走了。那只狐狸又蹲在森林边上，求他饶命，同时要给他忠告。小王子心地善良，说：“放心吧，小狐狸，我不伤害你。”

“我不会让你后悔的，”狐狸回答说，“你骑在我的尾巴上，这样能快一点到。”小王子刚骑上去，狐狸就飞奔起来，越过种种障碍，毛发在风中嗖嗖作响。他们来到那座村庄，小王子下来，他接受狐狸的忠告，径直走进那家寒碜的小客店，安安静静地在那里过了一夜。第二天早晨他走到田野上，狐狸已经蹲在那里，它说：“我还要告诉你该怎么办。你一直朝前面走，最后你会走到一座宫殿前面，那里躺着一大群士兵，你不用管他们，他们都在睡觉、打呼噜。你从他们中间穿过去，径直走进宫殿，穿过所有房间，最后你就到了一间挂着一个木鸟笼的房间，金鸟就在那木鸟笼里。旁边有一个空的华丽的金鸟笼，那是放在那儿当摆设的，你可得当心别把金鸟从那个难看的鸟笼里拿出来放进华丽的鸟笼里去，否则你会遭殃的。”说完这一席话，狐狸又翘起尾巴，让王子骑上去：狐狸飞奔起来，越过种种障碍，毛发在风中嗖嗖响。到了王宫一看，果然一切全跟狐狸说的一模一样。王子走进那房间，金鸟蹲在木鸟笼里，旁边还有一个金鸟笼；三只金苹果随便地放在地上。他想：“让这只美丽的鸟儿待在又平常、又难看的鸟笼里，太可惜了！”便打开鸟笼，捉住金鸟，把它放到金鸟笼里面。就在这一瞬间，金鸟一声尖叫，士兵们醒了，冲进来把他捉进监牢。第二天早晨，他在法庭受审，因为他对一切供认不讳，便被判处死刑。但是，国王说可以饶他不死，不过有一个条件：如果他能把那匹跑得比风还快的金马找来给他，他还可以赏赐他金鸟。

王子上路了，但他唉声叹气，心中悲伤，叫他到哪儿去找金马呢？忽然，他看见他的老朋友狐狸蹲在路旁。“你看，”狐狸说，“你不听我的话，事情搞糟了。不过你要振作起来，我还要关照你，告诉你怎么找到金马。你一直朝前走，就会走到一座宫殿那儿，金马就在马厩里。马厩前面躺着几个马夫，他们都睡着了在打呼噜，你可以从容不迫地把马牵出来。不过有一点你要注意：要给那匹马装上用木料和皮革做的马鞍，不能给它装上金马鞍，否则你会遭殃的。”说罢，狐狸翘起尾巴，王子骑上去，狐狸飞奔起来，越过种种障碍，毛发在风中嗖嗖作响。一切果然和狐狸说的一模一样。他走进金马所在的马厩，但当他要把次的马鞍放在马背上的时候，他想：“如果我不给他安上一副和他般配的鞍子，那就太辱没这匹好马了。”金马鞍刚碰着马背，那马一声长嘶，众马夫醒了，捉住年轻人，把他投入监狱。第二天，法庭判处他死刑，但国王允诺饶他一命，并把金马赠送给他，条件是如果他能把美丽的公主从黄金宫殿里带出来的话。

年轻人心情沉重地踏上旅途，幸运的是，他很快就见到了忠实的狐狸。“我本该叫你吃些苦头才是，”狐狸说，“不过我同情你，我要再一次帮助你摆脱困境。这条路直通黄金宫殿，晚上你就到那儿了。夜深人静时，美丽的公主要去浴室洗浴。她一进去，你随即跟上去给她一个吻，她就会跟你走，你就可以把她带走了。只是千万不能让公主和她父母告别，否则你就要遭殃。”说罢，狐狸翘起尾巴，王子骑上去，狐狸飞奔起来，越过种种障碍，毛发在风中嗖嗖响。到了黄金宫殿，情况果然像狐狸说的那样。他等到午夜时分，人们全都沉沉入梦了，美丽的少女走进浴室，他立即冲上去吻了她一下。她说，她愿意和他一起走，但她流着眼泪恳求他允许她和她父母告别。起初他不同意她的请求，但她哭得越来越伤心，还跪在他脚下哀求，他终于让步了。可是，公主刚走近她父亲床前，他就醒了，宫中所有人都醒了，他们把王子抓起来，关进监狱。

第二天早晨，国王对他说：“你的命完了，如果你在八天内能把在窗前挡住我的视线的那座山铲走，就饶你不死，还要把我女儿嫁给你。”王子开始不停地挖山，七天过后，他看自己挖得太少，所干的活加起来和没干也差不多，十分伤心，不再抱什么希望了。第七天晚上狐狸来了，说：“你那么不听劝告，不值得我帮助。不过，你就睡觉去吧，我替你干活。”第二天早晨他一觉醒来，望着窗外，那座山已经不见了。年轻人兴高采烈地跑去向国王报告事情办好了，不管国王愿意不愿意，他只得遵守诺言，把女儿许给他。

于是王子带上公主一起上路，走了没多久，忠实的狐狸来找他们，说：“最好的你虽然有了，但是金马还得和金殿公主在一起。”

“怎样才能得到金马呢？”王子问。

“我来告诉你，”狐狸回答说，“你先带着美丽的公主去见派你去金殿的国王。他一定非常高兴，愿意把金马牵出来送给你。你立即骑上马，俯身伸手向所有的人们告别，最后向美丽的公主告别时，你抓住她的手，一下子把她拉上马，远走高飞，没有人能追上你，因为金马跑得比风还快。”

一切顺利完成了，王子带上美丽的公主骑着金马走了。狐狸并没留下，它对王子说：“现在我还要帮你得到金鸟。快到关着金鸟的宫殿的时候，你让公主下马，我来保护她。你骑着金马进宫去。他们见了，一定非常高兴，会把金鸟给你拿出来。鸟笼一到了你手里，你立刻飞奔回来找我们，接走你的公主。”计策成功了，王子正要带着他的宝贝骑马回家，这时，狐狸说：“我帮了你的忙，现在该你报答我了。”

“你想要什么？”年轻人问。

“我们到了那座森林里面，你就开枪把我打死，砍下我的脑袋和爪子。”

“这不是忘恩负义嘛！”王子说，“我绝不能这样待你。”

狐狸说：“如果你不愿意这么做，我只好离开你。不过在我走之前，我还要给你一个忠告。两件事你要当心：不要买绞架上的肉，不要坐在水井旁边。”狐狸说罢，跑进森林里去了。

年轻人心里想：“这真是只奇特的动物，净是些古怪念头。谁会去买绞架上的肉！还有，我从来也没想过要在水井旁边坐一下。”他带着美丽的公主继续骑马往前走，又来到他的两个哥哥待着的那个村子。那里人声鼎沸，人群熙熙攘攘。他问出什么事了，有人告诉他要吊死两个人。他走近一看，原来是他的两个哥哥，他们干尽了坏事，花光了所有钱财。他问能不能放了他们。“如果您肯花钱赎他们，当然可以，”人们回答说，“可是您花钱买这两个坏蛋干什么呀？”他想也不想一下，就付钱赎了他们；两人获释，三兄弟结伴同行。

他们来到当初遇见狐狸的那座森林，太阳很毒，森林里清凉舒适，两个哥哥说：“我们在水井旁边坐下休息一会儿，吃点东西，喝点水吧。”小王子同意，说话间不知不觉就在水井旁边坐下，丝毫没料到会有什么危险。两个哥哥从后面把他推到井里，带着公主、金马和金鸟回家去见他们的父王。“我们不仅带回金鸟，”他们说，“还把金马和金殿公主都抢过来了。”大家喜气洋洋，但金马不吃草，金鸟不唱歌，公主坐着只是哭泣。

小弟弟并没有死。幸亏那井是口枯井，他摔在绵软的苔藓上，没有受伤，可是没法出来。这次又是那只忠实的狐狸救他脱险，它跳下井，责骂他忘了它的忠告。“我不能丢下你不管，”它说，“我要帮你重见天日。”它叫小王子紧紧抓住它的尾巴，然后把王子拉上去。“你还没有完全脱离危险，”狐狸说，“你的两个哥哥还不能确定你已经死了，他们派兵把这片林子包围了起来，你一露面，就会被他们杀死。”这时恰巧有个穷人坐在路边，王子和他换穿衣服，用这个办法回到国王宫中。没有一个人认出他，可是鸟儿又开始歌唱，马儿又开始吃草，美丽的公主也不再哭了。国王纳闷地问道：“这是怎么回事？”公主说：“我不知道，但是我原来那么伤心，现在我非常快乐。我觉得是我真正的未婚夫回来了。”尽管那两个哥哥威胁她，如果她泄漏什么，就要将她处死，她还是把发生的一切事情原原本本讲给了国王听。国王命令把王宫里所有的人都带来见他，小王子也来了，他衣衫褴褛，像个穷人，但公主一眼就认出他来，搂着他的脖子。那两个邪恶的哥哥被抓住处死，他和美丽的公主结婚了，并被指定为国王的继承人。

可怜的狐狸后来怎么样了？很久以后，有一天，王子又到森林里去，狐狸遇见他，说：“你希望得到的一切，现在你都有了，可是我的苦难还没有尽头，你是完全有能力解救我的。”它再次恳求王子射死它，砍下它的头和爪子。王子照它说的做了，刚刚做完，狐狸马上变成一个人，此人正是美丽的公主的哥哥，他终于解除了身上的魔法而获救。他们一生再没有什么痛苦，生活得非常幸福。





蜂王


有一次，两个王子出去冒险，竟过起放荡荒唐的生活，根本不再回家。叫作“小笨蛋”的最小的王子动身去找他的哥哥，终于找到他们，他们却嘲笑他，说他头脑这么简单，还想去闯世界，他们两个聪明得多，尚且不行。他们三人一起往前走，来到一个蚂蚁穴跟前。两个哥哥要捅蚂蚁穴，看小蚂蚁如何惊恐地搬运蚁卵，小笨蛋却说：“让小蚂蚁安宁吧，我不能容忍你们打扰它们。”他们继续往前走，来到一个湖边，湖面上游着许多鸭子。两个哥哥要捉几只来烤，小笨蛋不同意，说：“让小鸭子安宁吧，我不能容忍你们杀死它们。”他们来到一个蜂窝旁边，蜂窝里蜂蜜多得顺着树干往下流淌。两个哥哥要在树下点把火，熏死蜜蜂，好取走蜂蜜。小笨蛋又制止他们说：“让小蜜蜂安宁吧，我不能容忍你们烧死它们。”三兄弟终于来到一座宫殿，那里马厩里立着的都是石马，也看不见一个人影。他们穿过所有大厅，一直走到尽头一扇门前，门上挂着三把锁，门正中有个小窗，可以看到屋里。他们看见一个白发苍苍的小老头坐在一张桌子旁边。他们喊他一声，又喊一声，他都听不见，喊第三声时，他才站起来开锁，走出来。但他不说一句话，只领他们在一张摆着丰盛食物的桌旁坐下。吃喝完毕，老头儿又领他们去各自的卧室。第二天早晨，那个白发苍苍的小老头来找大王子，打手势把他领到一座石碑前面，碑上写着三件事，办好这三件事宫殿就能被解除魔法。第一件事是森林里苔藓下面藏着公主的一千颗珍珠，要在日落之前把它们都找出来，如果缺一颗，找珍珠的人就要变成石头。大王子去找了一整天，到日落天黑，才找到一百颗珍珠。结果像石碑上所写的那样，他变成了石头。第二天，二王子去冒险，他比老大也好不了多少，找到的不超过二百颗，他也变成了石头。最后轮到小笨蛋去苔藓里面找，但是找珍珠谈何容易，进展极其缓慢。他坐在一块石头上哭开了。正哭着，他救过命的蚂蚁王率领五千蚂蚁来了，不一会儿，这些小动物就把珍珠都找了出来，堆成了一堆。第二件事是要把公主卧室的钥匙从海里捞出来。小笨蛋来到海边，他救过命的那几只鸭子游过来，潜入海底，取出钥匙。第三件事是最难的，那就是要从睡着的三个公主当中找出那位最年轻、最可爱的公主。但是她们三个长得一模一样，毫无差别，只是入睡前吃过不同的甜食：大公主吃了一块糖，二公主吃了一点糖浆，小公主吃了一满勺蜂蜜。这时，受小笨蛋保护才没被烧死的蜂王来了，它把三个人的嘴都检查一遍，最后停在吃过蜂蜜的公主嘴上，这么一来，王子就认出要找的人来了。魔法已经破除，所有的人们都从酣睡中被解救出来，早先变成了石头的，也都恢复了人形。小笨蛋和最年轻可爱的公主结婚了，老国王去世后，他当了国王。他的两个哥哥也和公主的两个姐姐结了婚。





狼和人


有一次，狐狸跟狼说起人的强大有力，说没有一种动物能够敌得过人，必须用计，才能保全自己。狼回答说：“只要能让我看见一个人，我就向他扑过去。”

“这我可以帮助你，”狐狸说，“明天早晨来找我吧，我指一个人给你看。”第二天，狼很早就到了，狐狸带狼到猎人天天走的那条路上去。起初来了一个退伍老兵。“这是个人吗？”狼问。

“不，”狐狸回答，“从前他是人。”接着来了一个上学的小男孩。“这是个人吗？”

“不，将来他会成为人。”猎人终于来了，他背着双管猎枪，腰上挂着长猎刀。狐狸对狼说：“你看，那儿来了一个人，你得扑上去，我可得去我的洞里了。”于是狼向人扑过去，猎人一看，说：“可惜猎枪没装子弹。”举枪瞄准，用霰弹射击狼的面部。狼的脸扭曲得厉害，但它不胆怯，还往前进，猎人又打它一枪。狼强忍疼痛，直扑向猎人，猎人拔出闪亮的长猎刀，左砍右劈，接连几刀，砍得狼浑身流血，嚎叫着逃回去找狐狸。“狼兄，”狐狸说，“你和人斗得怎么样了？”

“啊，”狼回答说，“我没想到人这么厉害：他先从肩膀上拿出一根棍子，一吹，就有什么东西飞到我脸上，让我痒得要命；接着他又往棍子里吹气，像闪电、冰雹一样的东西飞到我的鼻子周围上来；我贴近他的时候，他抽出身上一根亮闪闪的肋条，用它打得我差点儿死在那里。”

“你看，”狐狸说，“你真是个吹牛大王，雷声大雨点小。”





老祖父和孙子


从前有一个年逾古稀的老人，两眼昏花耳朵聋，双膝颤抖。他坐在饭桌旁，拿不稳勺，经常把汤洒在桌布上，也常有东西从嘴角流出来。他的儿子和儿媳妇见了恶心，为此老人最后只好坐在炉灶后面的一个角落里，他们用一只小粗瓷碗给他盛饭，也不给他吃饱。他伤心地望着饭桌，眼眶里湿漉漉的。

有一天，他颤抖的双手连那只小粗瓷碗也拿不住，掉在地上摔碎了。年轻的女人骂他，他一句话也没说，只是叹气。她花几分钱给他买一只木碗，只准他用这木碗吃饭。

他们在家里坐着的时候，四岁的小孙子在地上拼凑一些小木块儿。“你在那儿干什么？”父亲问。“我做一只小碗，”孩子回答说，“我长大了，就叫爸爸妈妈用它吃饭。”

丈夫和妻子面面相觑了好一会儿，流下悔恨的泪水，立即把老祖父接到餐桌旁。从此一家人在一起吃饭，老祖父洒了些东西，他们也不再说什么。





金孩子


从前在一间小屋里住着一个穷人和他的妻子，除了一间小屋，他们一无所有，靠捕鱼为生，勉强度日。有一天，丈夫坐在水边撒网，捕到一条浑身金色的鱼。他正十分惊奇地打量这条鱼的时候，鱼儿开口说话了：“听着，渔夫，把我放回水里去，我就把你的小屋变成一座宫殿。”渔夫回答说：“如果我一点吃的都没有，宫殿对我有什么用？”金鱼继续说：“吃的也会安排好的，宫殿里会有一个柜子，你一打开，里面有一些碗盛着最好的菜肴，你要多少，就有多少。”

“如果这样，我可以帮你这个忙。”

“好，”金鱼说，“不过有个条件：你不许告诉世界上任何人，不管是谁，你的幸福是怎么得来的。只要说出一个字，一切就都没了。”

于是渔夫把这条神奇的鱼儿又放回水里，便回家去。他原先小屋所在的地方，现在耸立着一座大宫殿。他瞪大了眼睛观看，走进宫殿，看见妻子身上穿着美丽的衣裳，坐在一间豪华的房间里。她十分愉快地说：“丈夫，怎么一下子成这样了？我真高兴。”

“是啊，”她丈夫说，“我也很高兴，我肚子饿极了，给我拿点儿吃的吧。”

“什么也没有，”妻子说，“在这新房子里面我什么也找不着。”

“这不难，”丈夫说，“我看见那边有个大柜子，你去把它打开。”她一打开柜子，里面有糕点、肉、水果和葡萄酒，让人看了喜上心头。妻子非常高兴地叫了起来：“心肝儿，你还想要什么？”他们坐下来一起吃喝。吃饱了，妻子问道：“你说，这些财富都是哪儿来的？”

“唉，别问了，”丈夫说，“我不能说，我要是对谁说了，我们的幸福就完了。”

“好，”她说，“不该我知道的，我也不想知道。”但这并不是她的真心话。她日夜心神不安，折磨她丈夫，刺激他，直到他无法忍耐，终于说出他逮着一条神奇的金鱼又放了它，这一切都是那金鱼给的。这话刚说出口，富丽堂皇的宫殿连同那个大柜子立刻就不见了，他们又坐在原先的渔民小屋里了。丈夫又得重操旧业捕鱼去。但他福星高照，又捕到那条金鱼。“听着，”鱼儿说，“如果你再放我到水里，我就把那座宫殿连同装满红烧油炸食物的柜子一起还给你。不过你不得泄露是谁给的，不然的话，一切都会再丢掉的。”

“我会小心的。”渔夫回答说，把鱼儿放回水里。家里一切又恢复了早先的豪华气派，妻子对重新获得幸福十分高兴，但好奇心使她不得安宁，过了几天，她又问起这事的来龙去脉。丈夫沉默了一段时间，最后她又整得他一气之下，把秘密泄露了出来。刹那间，宫殿不见了，他们又坐在旧渔民小屋里了。“都是你闹的，”丈夫说，“现在我们又得挨饿了。”

“啊，”妻子说，“我如果不知道财富的来路，宁可不要，否则我心里总不踏实。”

丈夫又去捕鱼，过了一段时间，他偏偏又第三次捕到那条鱼。“你听我说，”鱼儿说，“我看我几次三番落在你手里，真是命中注定；把我带回你家吧，把我切成六块，两块给你妻子吃，两块给你的马吃，两块埋在地里，这样，你会有福的。”渔夫把鱼儿带回家，照它说的办理。埋在地里的两块鱼肉后来长成了两朵金百合，马儿生了两只金马驹，渔夫的妻子生了两个孩子，浑身上下全是金的。

两个孩子渐渐长大，长得又高大又英俊，百合花、马驹和他们一同长大。他们说：“父亲，我们要骑上金马到世界上走走。”父亲忧心忡忡地回答说：“要是你们走了，我又不知道你们的情况，我怎么能受得了呢？”孩子们说：“家里有两朵金百合花，可以看到我们的情况：花儿鲜美，我们就健康；花儿枯萎，我们就有病；如果它们耷拉下来，就是我们死了。”他们骑马来到一家客店，里面有许多人，看见这两个兄弟，就笑起来，嘲弄他们。一个金孩子听了他们嘲笑，受了羞辱，不愿去闯世界了，又回到父亲身边。另一个继续往前走，来到一座大森林。他要骑马过去，人们对他说：“你不能去，森林里面有很多强盗，他们会打你的主意，他们见你和你的马都是金的，会打死你的。”但他没有被吓住，他说：“我非过去不可。”他拿了几张熊皮，把自己和马完全包裹起来，不露出一点金子，便放心大胆地骑马进森林。走了一小段路，就听见树丛里面有响动，有人在说话。有人在一侧喊：“这儿有一个人！”另一侧又有人喊：“放他走吧，这是个懒汉，穷得跟教堂里的耗子一样，没什么油水，对我们有什么用处！”就这样，金孩子幸运地穿过森林，没受到伤害。

有一天，他来到一座村庄，看见村里有个非常美丽的姑娘，他想，世上再不会有比她更漂亮的少女了。他非常爱她，便走到她跟前对她说：“我真心爱你，你愿意做我的妻子吗？”那姑娘也很喜欢他，便应允了，说：“好的，我愿意成为你的妻子，终生对你忠诚。”于是他们举行了婚礼；正当他们沉浸在最大的欢乐中的时候，新娘子的父亲回到家里，看见他女儿结了婚，感到很惊奇，他说：“你的新郎在哪里？”人们把金孩子指给他看，这时金孩子还裹着一身熊皮。父亲见了怒气冲冲地说：“决不能叫一个懒汉娶走我的女儿。”他要把他杀了。新娘子苦苦求父亲说：“他已经是我的丈夫，我从心底里爱他。”一直说到父亲怒气渐消。但他仍然存着这个念头，第二天一早起床，就要去看女儿的丈夫是不是一个衣衫褴褛的下贱乞丐。他往屋里张望，只见床上躺着一个英俊的男子，浑身金色，脱下的熊皮扔在地上。他退回去，心里想道：“好在我怒气消了，我几乎犯下大错。”

金孩子在做梦，梦见他外出狩猎，追逐一只美丽的鹿；早晨醒来，他对他的新娘子说：“我要出去打猎。”她感到害怕，请求他不要去，她说：“你很可能要遇到大灾难的。”但他回答说：“无论如何我必须去。”他随即站起来，前往森林，不多一会儿，一只骄傲的鹿果然出现在他眼前，完全像梦中的情景一样。他端起猎枪要射击，但那只鹿跑了。他在后面紧追。越过沟渠，穿过树丛，追了一整天，并不觉得疲乏；但在夜晚，鹿在他的眼前消失了。金孩子环顾周遭，他面前是一座小屋，里面坐着一个女巫。他敲门，一个老妈妈出来问道：“这么晚了，你到这大森林里来干什么？”

他说：“你看见一只鹿没有？”

“看见过，”她回答说，“我认得那只鹿。”随她从屋里出来的一只小狗冲他狂吠。“给我安静，你这混蛋，”他说，“再叫，我射死你。”女巫听了，怒喝一声：“什么，你要打死我的小狗！”马上将他变成了一块石头，躺在地上。他的新娘子等着他，老是不见他回去，心里想：“我心里害怕，心情沉重，他一定出事了。”

在家里，另一个兄弟站在金百合花旁边，突然有一株耷拉下来了。“上帝啊，”他说，“我的兄弟大难临头了，我必须前去，或许我能解救他。”他跨上金马，策马奔入他的兄弟变成石头躺着的那座大森林。老巫婆从她的房子里走出来大声和他说话，也想迷惑他，但他不走近前去，只说：“如果你不把我的兄弟救活，我就把你射死。”尽管她很不乐意，也只得用手指去摸石头，他的兄弟立刻恢复了人形，活过来了。两个金孩子重逢，他们都很高兴，互相亲吻、拥抱，一起骑马离开森林，一个去找他的新娘子，一个回到父亲身旁。父亲见了他说：“我知道你救了你的兄弟了，因为金百合一下子又挺立起来，继续开花了。”他们生活得非常快乐，一直到他们生命的终点。





穷人和富人


在古代，上帝还在人间漫游的时候，一天晚上，他感到疲乏了，还没能找到住宿的地方，黑夜已经来临。他站在路上，前面有两座房子彼此相对，一座又大又漂亮，另一座又小又寒酸。那座大房子是一个富人的，小房子是一个穷人的。

上帝想：“我到富人家去不会给他添麻烦，我要在他家里过夜。”富人听见敲门声，打开窗户问陌生人有什么事，上帝回答说：“我只请求有个地方睡觉。”

富人把行路人从头到脚打量一番，见上帝衣着朴素，不像口袋里有很多钱的样子，便摇头说：“我不能接待你，我的房间都装满草和种子，如果谁来敲我家的门，我都让他住宿，我自己就该成叫花子了。你去别处找住的地方吧。”说完，使劲关上窗户，让上帝干站着。

于是上帝转过身来向那座小房子走去。才敲一下门，穷人已经把门打开，请旅行者进去。“请在我家过夜吧，”他说，“天已经黑了，今天你不能再赶路了。”上帝听了很高兴，走进屋里到他跟前。穷人的妻子向他伸出手欢迎他说，他们没什么东西，请他随便凑合着用；如果需要什么，他们会很乐意提供。说完话，她把土豆放在炉火上，煮土豆这工夫，她去挤羊奶，打算用这点羊奶就着土豆吃。食物摆上了餐桌，上帝和他们一同坐下，一同用餐。他觉得这简单的食物味道很好，因为餐桌上有愉快的笑容。吃过晚饭，到了该睡觉的时候，女人悄悄把丈夫叫到一旁说：“亲爱的丈夫，你听我说，我们今天铺个草垫子睡一夜吧，让那个可怜的行路人在我们床上睡觉，能休息得好些。他走了一整天路，一定很累了。”

“这样很好，”他回答说，“我就让他在大床上休息。”说着，他就去跟上帝说，如果他不介意，就请他在他们的床上躺下，好好歇一歇腿脚。上帝不肯占用两个老人的卧床，但经不起他们恳请，终于同意睡他们的床，他们自己就在地上用干草打地铺。第二天早晨，天还没大亮，他们就起来了，拿出他们最好的东西给客人做早点。太阳照进窗户，上帝起床后，又同他们一起用餐。吃过早饭要上路了，上帝站在门口，转过身子说：“你们心地这么善良又这么虔诚，说出你们的三个愿望，我要使你们的愿望实现。”穷人说：“我愿能永远快乐幸福，我们俩人在世上活着的时候都健康无病，每天都有面包吃，不致挨饿；除了这三件事，我不知道还该希望得到什么。”上帝说：“这房子旧了，你不想要一所新的吗？”穷人说：“啊，如果还能得到一所新房子，我太高兴了。”于是上帝满足了他们的愿望，把他们的旧房子变成了一座新房子，再一次祝福他们，然后继续上路了。

天大亮了，富人起床，把头探出窗外，看见对门往日破旧小屋所在的地方，立起一座崭新的漂亮的红砖房，窗户明亮。他瞪大眼睛，喊妻子过来，说：“你说，这是怎么回事？昨天还是破旧的小屋，今天就变成一座漂亮的新房子了。快过去问问是怎么回事。”富人的妻子过去详细询问穷人，穷人讲给她听：“昨天晚上有一个走远路的人来投宿，今天早晨临走时他答应满足我们三个愿望：一是永远快乐幸福，二是从此健康无病，三是衣食不成问题，最后还给了我们一座漂亮的新住宅。”富人的老婆赶紧跑回去跟她丈夫讲这一切的来由。她丈夫说：“我真该死，我真该杀，早知道就好了！那个陌生人先到这里来过，是我把他撵走的。”

“唉，你呀，”老婆说，“快骑马追，还能追上那人，你得让他也满足你的三个愿望。”富人听从这好主意，策马狂奔，追上上帝。他言辞谦卑恳切，说没能立即让他进屋，请他不要见怪，因为他还没找到大门钥匙时，他已经走了。回来时请他一定到他家去。“好，”上帝说，“如果我回来，就这么办。”于是富人问，能不能像对待他的邻居那样，也满足他三个愿望。可以，亲爱的上帝说，他能办到，不过这对他没什么好处，他倒是什么都不祈求最好。但富人认为，只要能实现，他就要寻找那能给他带来幸福的东西。亲爱的上帝说：“骑马回家吧，你说的三个愿望都会实现。”

富人如愿以偿，骑马回家，开始琢磨该提些什么愿望好。他一动脑筋，手放掉缰绳，马撒欢跳跃起来，一再打断他的思路，他根本无法集中精神思考。他拍拍马的脖颈说：“安静点儿，利泽！”但马儿还是很不听话，末了他火了，暴躁地大声喊道：“那我就要你的命！”话音一落，砰的一声，他摔下来，马躺在地上动弹不了，死了。就这样，他实现了自己的第一个愿望。但他为人吝啬，不肯扔掉马鞍，便取下它来，扛在肩上，现在只能徒步走了。“我还有两个愿望，”他以此自我安慰。他在沙地上慢慢地走，时当正午，烈日烘烤，热得他心中烦躁；马鞍压得他后背疼痛，他还没想好该祈求什么。“即使祈求得到世上所有的帝国和珍宝，”他自言自语，“以后还会想要这样那样的东西，这一点现在我就很清楚；我要一劳永逸地解决问题，使我往后根本不需要再祈求什么才好。”他叹口气又接着说：“是啊，如果我是个巴伐利亚[1]农夫，也让说三个愿望，那就好办了：第一希望有很多啤酒，第二要有足够他喝的啤酒，第三还要一大桶啤酒。”有时他觉得想到合适的要求了，过一会儿又觉得那个愿望毕竟太微不足道。他脑子里想他老婆这会儿可真舒服，待在家里，坐在凉爽的房间里吃好吃的东西。这念头使他十分恼火，竟不自觉地说出：“我要她在家里坐在这马鞍上下不来，省得我驮着它！”他一说完最后一个字，背上的马鞍顿时不见了，他知道他的第二个愿望也已经实现了。这时他觉得热得难受，奔跑起来，想独自坐在他的房间里想出些伟大的东西作为他最后的愿望。可是到家一打开房门，他的老婆在房间正中坐在马鞍上没法下来，又哭又叫。他说：“别着急，我要发愿让全世界的财富都归你所有，你就好好坐着吧。”她骂他是笨蛋，说：“我坐在马鞍上下不来，全世界的财富对我有屁用；你发愿让我坐上去，就得把我再弄下来！”不管他愿意还是不愿意，他都得说出第三个愿望，让他的妻子能从马鞍上下来；这个愿望很快就实现了。富人除了气恼、辛苦和辱骂，什么也没有得到，还损失了一匹马。而穷人夫妇过着愉快、平静而虔诚的生活一直到老。

会唱歌会跳舞的小百灵鸟


从前有一个男人要去做一次长途旅行，临别的时候他问他的三个女儿，要他给她们带些什么东西。大女儿要珍珠，二女儿要钻石，三女儿却说：“亲爱的父亲，我想要一只会唱歌会跳舞的小百灵鸟。”父亲说：“好的，如果能够找到，就给你。”于是他和三个女儿一一吻别，然后上路。待到他要踏上归途的时候，他给两个女儿买了珍珠和钻石，可是寻遍了所有地方，都找不到会唱歌会跳舞的小百灵鸟，他心里十分难过，因为小女儿是他最心爱的孩子。他沿着一条路走进一座森林，森林深处有一座宫殿，宫殿近旁有一棵树，他看见这棵树的树梢上有一只小百灵鸟在唱歌、跳舞。“嗨，你来得正是时候。”他说，心里非常高兴，就叫仆人爬上去逮那小鸟儿。仆人刚走近那棵树，只见树下跳起一只狮子，抖动鬣毛，大吼几声，震得林木枝叶乱颤。“谁要想偷走我的会唱歌会跳舞的小百灵鸟，”狮子吼叫道，“我就吃掉他。”那男人说：“我不知道这只鸟儿是你的，为了弥补我的过错，我愿意以重金自赎，只求你不害我性命。”狮子说：“说什么都救不了你的命，除非你答应把你一进家门第一个遇见的人或物送给我。如果你愿意这么做，我就送你一条命，这只小百灵鸟也送给你的小女儿。”那男人拒绝，说：“最先遇见我的可能是我的小女儿，她最爱我，我回家她总是跑过来迎接我。”仆人心里害怕，他说：“你最先遇见的也不一定就是你的女儿，也许是一只猫或是一只狗。”主人被他说服了，接过那只会唱歌会跳舞的小百灵鸟，答应狮子把最先遇见的给它。

他踏进家门时，第一个前来迎接他的，不是别人，正是他最心爱的小女儿。她跑过来吻他、拥抱他，当她看见他给她带来那只会唱歌会跳舞的小百灵鸟，她高兴极了。但她的父亲高兴不起来，他哭了，说：“我最亲爱的孩子，这只小鸟儿是用了高昂的代价买来的，我不得不答应一只狂野的狮子，把你给它，他会撕碎你、吃了你的。”他把事情经过原原本本告诉了她，叫她不要去，要发生什么事情，就让它发生好了。但女儿安慰他，说：“亲爱的父亲，你既然答应了，就要信守诺言，我要去，我会让狮子平静下来的，我会再回来看你。”第二天早晨她问清楚了路，和家里人告别后便沉着地走进森林。那只狮子本是个王子，被人施了魔法，白天是狮子，他手下那些人也都变成狮子，夜间他们全都恢复原先的人形。她到达时受到亲切热情的接待，被领进王宫。夜幕降临，狮子变成一个美男子，他们举行了隆重的婚礼，夜间醒着，白天睡觉，日子过得非常快乐。有一天，他说：“明天你父亲家里举行盛宴，庆祝你的大姐结婚，如果你想去，就叫我的狮子领你去。”她说她很想去看看她父亲，于是她在众狮子陪同下回去了。回到家里，大家都非常高兴，因为他们全都以为她已被狮子撕碎，早已不在人世。她跟他们讲她的丈夫多么漂亮，她的生活多么美满。她和家人待在一起，一直到婚礼结束，才重返森林。二女儿结婚时，又邀请她参加婚礼，她对她的狮子丈夫说：“这一次我不自己一个人去了，你得和我一起去。”但是狮子说，这样做对他非常危险，因为，那儿燃烧的灯火，只要有一线灯光映照到他身上，他就会变成一只鸽子，就得和鸽子一起飞七年。“啊，”她说，“放心跟我去吧，我会小心保护你，不让你接触到一点灯光。”于是他们一同前往，把他们的小孩子也一起带去了。她让人在那里建造一座大厅，造得十分坚固厚实，透不进一丝光线，准备在点燃婚礼灯烛的时候，让他待在里面。可是门是用新木头做的，裂开了一条细小的缝隙，谁都没有察觉。婚礼十分隆重，但当新郎新娘从教堂回来，人们高举无数火炬、灯烛经过大厅时，一丝细如毫发的火光照在王子身上，光线一碰到他，霎时间，他就变成了鸽子。她又进去找他的时候，看不见他了，只见那儿有一只白鸽。鸽子对她说：“我必须在世上飞七年：我会每七步流下一滴鲜红的血，掉下一根白色羽毛，让它们给你引路，如果你跟踪找我，你就能解救我。”

说罢，鸽子飞出门外，她紧跟在它后面，它每七步流下一滴鲜红的血滴和一根洁白的羽毛，为她引路。她不停息地走着，走到遥远的远方，不看周围景物，也不休息。快满七年的时候，她很高兴，以为他们不久便可获救，其实还差得远呢。一天，她正走着，没有羽毛掉下来，也没有鲜血滴下来，她抬眼仰望，已不见白鸽的踪影。她想，人无法帮助她，于是上天去找太阳，对太阳说：“你照进所有缝隙，照耀在所有峰巅之上，你可曾看见一只飞翔的白鸽？”

“没有，”太阳说，“我没有看见白鸽，不过我送你一个小盒子，你如有危难就打开它。”她谢过太阳，继续向前走，直至夜晚降临，明月当空。她问月亮：“你整夜照着所有田野和森林，你可曾看见一只飞翔的白鸽？”

“没有，”月亮回答说，“我没有看见白鸽，不过我送你一颗鸡蛋，十分困难的时候就把它打破。”她谢过月亮，继续往前走，直至夜风渐起，吹拂着她。她问夜风：“你在所有林木上方吹拂，从一切树叶底下吹过，你可曾看见一只飞翔的白鸽？”

“没有，”夜风说，“我没有看见白鸽，不过我可以问问东风西风和南风，也许它们见过它。”东风和西风来了，它们都没有看见，但南风说：“我见过那只白鸽，它飞到红海去了，它到了那里又变成狮子，因为七年时间已经过去。雄狮在红海边和一只龙形怪兽搏斗，那龙形怪兽是一位公主中了魔法幻化成的。”夜风接着对她说：“我给你出个主意。你去红海海滨，红海右岸生长着高大的芦苇，你把它们数一数，砍下第十一根芦苇，用它拍打龙形怪兽，狮子就能制服它，它们两个就都能恢复人形。然后你看一下周围，你会看见巨雕格拉夫[1]兀立在红海之滨，你和你的丈夫赶快跃上巨雕的背，它会载你们飞越海洋，返回家乡。我送你一个胡桃，飞到红海当中的时候，把它扔下去，它很快就会浮上来，从水里会长出一棵巨大的胡桃树，让格拉夫停在上面休息；如果它得不到休息，它就没有足够的力气载你们飞越红海；如果你忘了扔下胡桃，它就会把你们扔下大海。”

于是她前往红海，夜风告诉她的，她都找到了。她数海边的芦苇，砍下第十一根，用它拍打龙形怪兽，狮子把它制服了，它们两个立时恢复了原先的人形。可是，先前被变成龙形怪兽的公主一解除魔法，就抱起年轻人坐上格拉夫的背，带着他远走高飞。这时那跋涉万里的可怜女子，又孤零零地独自一人，她坐在地上哭泣。但她终于振作起来，说：“风吹得到的地方，我都要去，只要还有公鸡在啼叫，我就要去寻找，直至找到他为止。”她又走了很远很远的路，终于来到他们两人居住的宫殿。她听说不久要举行一次盛宴，那时他们就要结婚了。她说：“上帝还会帮助我的。”便打开太阳送她的小盒子，里面有一件衣裳，像太阳那样光华灿烂。她把它拿出来，穿着它上宫殿去，所有的人，连新娘子也惊奇地望着她。新娘子非常喜爱这件衣裳，她想，这可以做她的新婚礼服，便问她那衣裳是不是要卖？“用金钱财富来买，不卖，”她回答说，“如果用血肉来买，就卖。”新娘子问这话是什么意思。她说：“让我在新郎睡觉的房间睡一夜吧。”新娘子不肯，但又很喜欢那件衣裳，终于允许了，却叫侍仆给王子喝一杯安眠药酒。到了夜间，王子睡了，她被人领进房间。她在床前坐下，说：“我跟随你七年，到太阳那里、到月亮那里、到东南西北风那里打听你的消息，还帮助你战胜龙形怪兽，难道你就完全把我遗忘了吗？”王子睡得很深沉，只觉得外边似有风吹过枞树林的飒飒声。第二天天刚亮，她就又被人领出去，不得不交出她那件金衣裳。连这办法也无济于事，她伤心地走到外面一片草地上，坐下来哭泣。这时候，她忽然想起还有月亮送给她的一颗鸡蛋，她把它敲破，从里面出来一只母鸡和十二只小鸡儿，浑身都是纯金的，小鸡在周围跑来跑去，叽叽喳喳，过一会儿又钻到母鸡翅膀底下，真是一幅世上最美不过的图画。她站起来，在草地上赶着小鸡儿往前走，直至公主从窗口看见它们。她非常喜欢这些小鸡儿，立即问她卖不卖。“用金钱财富来买，不卖；如果用血肉来买，就卖。让我在新郎睡觉的房间再睡一夜吧。”新娘子答应了，她还想像前一天夜晚那样欺骗她。但当王子上床时，他问他的侍从昨天夜间喃喃的低语声和飒飒声是怎么回事。侍从把事情原原本本对他讲了，说他昨晚奉命给王子喝一杯安眠药酒，因为有一个可怜的姑娘悄悄在他房间里面过夜，今天夜里又要他再给他喝一杯。王子说：“把酒泼在床边。”入夜，她又被领进王子的卧室，她一开始诉说她那伤心的往事，王子立即从她的声音认出是自己的爱妻，他跳起来大声说：“现在我才真正得救了，以前我就像在梦中一样，那个外国公主对我施了魔法，使我忘了你，但是上帝及时地解除了她对我的迷惑。”于是俩人连夜悄悄离开王宫，因为他们害怕公主的父亲，他是一个魔法师。他们坐在巨雕格拉夫背上，巨雕驮着他们飞越红海，飞到中途，她扔下胡桃。霎时间生长出一株巨大的胡桃树，巨雕停在树上休息，然后载他们回家。在家里，他们见到他们的孩子长得又高大又漂亮，从此他们过着快乐的生活，一直到死。

[1]传说中的怪兽，其外形为鹰头狮身，有双翼，爪如钩。





牧鹅女


从前有一个年老的王后，丈夫已去世多年，她有一个美丽的女儿。女儿长大了，许给远方一位王子。临近婚期，新娘需动身到外国去，老王后为她收拾了许多贵重的器物，首饰、酒杯、金银和珠宝，总之，凡是帝王家公主陪嫁中应有的宝物，无不尽有，因为老王后非常疼爱她女儿。她还给公主一名侍女，要她一起骑马，把新娘送交给新郎本人。公主和侍女每人得到一匹马，公主的马叫法拉达，是一匹会说话的马。离别时，老母亲到她卧室取出一把小刀，划破手指，流出鲜血；她拿一小块白布接在下面，在白布上滴下三滴血，她把白布交给女儿，说：“亲爱的孩子，保存好，路上你会用得着的。”

于是母女俩伤心地离别了。公主把那一小块白布藏在胸前，骑上马去找她的未婚夫。走了一个钟头，她又热又渴，对侍女说：“你下马，用给我带的杯子舀些溪水，我要喝水。”侍女说：“你要是渴了，就自己下马去趴在溪边喝水，我不想给你当奴婢。”公主渴极了，只好下马，去溪边弯腰喝水，没能用上那只金杯。她说：“啊，上帝！”这时三滴血回答说：“如果你母亲知道了，她的心可要碎了。”可是公主谦和容让，什么也没说，又骑上马。她们又走了几里路，天很热，太阳毒辣辣的，没多久她又渴了。她们正来到一条河边，公主又叫侍女：“你下马去，用我的金杯盛些水给我喝。”她早忘了侍女那些没好气的话了。这回侍女更加傲慢地说：“要喝你就自己去喝，我不想做你的奴婢。”公主渴极了，便下马趴在河岸上哭泣：“啊，上帝！”三滴血又回答说：“如果你母亲知道了，她的心可要碎了。”她趴着喝水，上身探出在河面上，藏在胸前那块有三滴血的白布掉进水里，顺水漂走了，公主由于心里十分害怕，没有发现。但侍女看见了，并且为自己能控制公主而感到高兴，因为公主一旦失去那三滴血，她也就变得软弱无力了。公主又要骑上她那匹叫法拉达的马的时候，侍女说：“我骑法拉达，你骑我那匹劣马！”公主只得忍气吞声。侍女接着又用更严厉的话命令公主脱下皇家的服饰，穿上侍女的衣服，最后还要她对天起誓，在王宫里对任何人都绝口不提此事；若不起誓，就要当场杀死她。这一切，法拉达都看见了，注意到了。

于是侍女跨上法拉达，而真正的新娘却骑着劣马，她们就这样一直走到王宫。她们的到来使大家非常高兴，王子朝她们快步走来，把侍女从马上抱下来，以为这就是他的妻子，领着她走上阶梯，真正的公主却得在下面站着。老国王在窗边观察，看她待在庭院里，长得清秀、娇嫩又非常美丽，随即去王子房间里问新娘带来的站在庭院里的那个女子是谁。“是我半路上找来做伴的；请给她找个什么活干，省得她没事光闲站着！”可是老国王没什么工作可给她做，就说：“有个少年在牧鹅，她可以去帮帮他。”牧鹅少年名叫小屈尔德，真新娘得帮他牧鹅。

不久，假新娘对年轻的王子说：“亲爱的丈夫，请你帮我个忙！”他回答说：“我一定照办。”“请你叫一个屠夫来，砍下我骑来的那匹马的马头，因为它在路上惹我生气。”原来她害怕法拉达说出她对待公主的实情。现在事情落到这一步，法拉达眼看活不成了，真公主也听到了消息，她暗地里许诺屠夫一笔钱，让他给她办一件事。城里有一个阴暗的大城门，每天早晨她都要赶鹅从那里经过，她要屠夫把马头挂在这阴暗的城门下，让她能时常见到它。屠夫答应照办，砍下马头，把它牢牢钉在阴森的城门下面。

清晨，她和小屈尔德赶鹅出城，从城门下走过时，她说：





啊，法拉达，你挂在这里！





那马头回答说：





啊，公主，你在这儿牧鹅，

如果你母亲知道了，

她的心可要碎了。





她默不作声，走出城门，到了草地上，她坐下来，打开一头纯金的头发，小屈尔德见了，喜欢她亮丽的头发，要去拔几根下来。于是她说：





吹吧，风儿，快快吹，

吹掉小屈尔德的帽子，

让他快跑去追，

等我梳好、编好辫子，

再让他戴上帽子。





立刻刮起一阵大风，把小屈尔德的帽子刮到老远的地方，他赶紧去追帽子。他回来时，公主已梳完、编好发辫，他一根头发丝也没能拿到。小屈尔德生气了，不和她说话；他们就这么放鹅，直到天黑才回家。

第二天早晨，他们从阴森的城门下走过，少女说：





啊，法拉达，你挂在这里！





法拉达回答说：





啊，公主，你在这儿牧鹅，

如果你母亲知道了，

她的心可要碎了。





到了田野上，她又坐在草地上开始梳理她的头发，小屈尔德跑过来，伸手要抓，她赶快念：





吹吧，风儿，快快吹，

吹掉小屈尔德的帽子，

让他快跑去追，

等我梳好、编好辫子，

再让他戴上帽子。





于是风吹起来，刮走他头上的帽子，刮得远远的，小屈尔德只得追过去；公主的头发他一根也没抓着。他们继续放鹅，直到天黑。

晚上，他们回家后，小屈尔德就去找老国王，说：“我再也不和那个女孩子一起牧鹅了！”

“为什么？”老国王问。

“唉，她惹得我整天不高兴。”老国王要他讲他们之间发生了什么事情。小屈尔德说：“每天早晨，我们赶着鹅群从阴暗的城门下经过，那儿城墙上挂着一只马头，她对那马头说：





啊，法拉达，你挂在这里！





那马头回答说：





啊，年轻的公主，

你在这儿牧鹅，

如果你母亲知道了，

她的心可要碎了。”





小屈尔德又讲了牧鹅草地上的事，讲他如何在风中追他的帽子。

老国王叫小屈尔德第二天仍照常去牧鹅，他自己天一亮就坐在阴暗的城门后面，听她怎么和法拉达的头说话。接着又尾随他们到郊外，躲在草地上一棵矮树后面。不久，他亲眼看见牧鹅女和牧鹅少年赶着鹅群走来，过一小会儿，她坐在地上，散开一头灿然生辉的金发。她随即又说：





吹吧，风儿，快快吹，

吹掉小屈尔德的帽子，

让他快跑去追，

等我梳好、编好辫子，

再让他戴上帽子。





于是刮起一阵风，卷走小屈尔德的帽子，让他跑得很远，姑娘静静地梳理头发，编好发辫，这一切老国王都看在眼里。随后他悄悄回去了。晚上，牧鹅女回到家里，老国王把她叫到一旁，问她为什么这样行事。“我不能告诉你，我也不能对任何人诉苦，因为我曾经对天发过誓，那时候我不发誓，就要被杀死。”老国王逼迫她，使她不得安宁，但他无法从她口中得到一点东西。于是他说：“如果你什么也不肯对我说，那就对这里的这个铁炉诉诉你的苦吧！”说完，他就走了。她爬进铁炉里，号啕大哭，把心里话尽情倾诉出来：“我被所有的人抛弃了，我本是个公主，坏心肠的侍女强迫我脱下我身上穿戴的王家服饰，叫我当牧鹅女，干下贱的活。如果我的母亲知道了，她的心可要碎了。”老国王就站在铁炉烟囱旁边，她说的每一句话，他都听得清清楚楚。他又走进去，叫她从炉子里面爬出来，给她换上王室的衣裳，原来她是个绝代佳人。老国王把他儿子叫进来，向他讲清楚他的新娘子是个假新娘，那人只不过是个侍女；当过牧鹅女、站在这里的这个才是真的新娘。年轻的国王看见她有这样的美貌和品德，非常高兴，吩咐大摆宴席，邀请所有人及好朋友赴宴。新郎坐在最上面，旁边是公主，侍女在另一侧，但是侍女的眼睛花了，没认出那个穿戴得一身珠光宝气的女子是谁。他们吃了饭菜喝了酒，兴致很好，老国王说一个谜题让侍女回答，说有个女人如此这般欺骗她的主人，老国王乘机把事情经过全部讲出来，问道：“这个女人应当如何处置？”假新娘说：“把她脱光衣服，塞进一只内壁钉着尖尖的铁钉的大桶里去，用两匹马拉着这桶在街上跑来跑去，直到她死了为止。”老国王说：“那个女人就是你，你已经给自己做出判决，就照你的判决处置吧。”判决执行后，年轻的国王和他的真正的妻子结婚，两人一同和平幸福地治理他们的国家。





金山国王


一个商人有两个孩子，一个男孩，一个女孩。两个孩子都还很小，不会走路。商人有两条船满载货物在海上航行，这是他的全部财产，他正想靠这两条船发大财，却传来船只沉没的消息。现在他不是富人，而是穷人了，除了城郊一块田地，他已一无所有。为了排遣忧愁，他去那块地里来回踱步。忽然，一个黑衣小矮人站在他身边，问他有什么心事，为什么这样悲伤。商人说：“如果你能帮助我，我就告诉你。”

“谁知道呢，”黑衣小矮人回答说，“也许我可以帮助你。”于是商人说，他的全部财产都沉到海底了，现在就剩这块土地了。“不要伤心，”小矮人说，“如果你答应我，把到家里的时候第一个碰到你的腿的东西十二年后带到这儿给我，你就会有钱，要多少有多少。”商人心里想：“第一个碰到我的腿的，除了狗还会是什么？”根本没想到他的小儿子，便答应了，写了字据，签了字，交给黑衣小矮人，随即回家了。

小儿子见他回到家里，非常高兴，扶着板凳摇摇晃晃迎着他走去，抱住他的腿。父亲大惊，蓦然想起自己的许诺，现在他明白他写的字据许诺人家的是什么了。但他在箱子盒子里并未发现钱，因此，他以为这不过是黑衣小矮人说说玩笑话罢了。一个月后，他到阁楼上去，要收罗一些旧锡器卖，发现那里有一大堆钱。现在他非常高兴，又做起买卖，成了比以前更有钱的富商巨贾，悠游岁月，十分惬意。在此期间，男孩渐渐长大，聪慧伶俐。可是，越接近十二年的期限，商人越是忧心如焚，他的惊恐从脸上都能看得出来。有一天，儿子问他哪儿不舒服，父亲不肯说，但儿子一直追问，父亲终于告诉儿子，说他糊里糊涂地答应把他交给一个黑衣小矮人，为此发了大财。他已把签名盖章的字据给了人家，如今一满十二年，就得把他交出去。儿子说：“哦，父亲，你别害怕，事情会好起来的，那个黑衣人不能把我怎么样。”

儿子让一个教士为他祝福，时辰一到，他们一起来到那块庄稼地里，儿子画了一个圆圈，自己和父亲一起站在圆圈里面。黑衣小矮人来了，对老人说：“你答应给我的，带来了吗？”老人默不作声，儿子问：“你要什么？”黑衣小矮人说：“我和你父亲说话，没和你说。”儿子回答说：“你欺骗我父亲，诱使他交出字据。”

“不，”黑衣小矮人说，“我不放弃我的权力。”他们又谈了很长时间，最后取得一致意见：儿子既不属于黑衣小矮人，也不再属于他的父亲，他得坐在河岸边的小船上，由父亲踹一脚，让小船在河上顺流而下，孩子的命运就交由河水摆布。于是儿子告别父亲，坐进小船，父亲不得不用自己的脚把船蹬离河岸。小船翻了，船底朝天，船顶没入水中；父亲心想儿子完了，便回家去哀悼他。

小船其实并没有沉没，它平稳地顺流漂去，年轻人稳稳当当坐在里面，漂流了很久，终于搁浅在一处陌生的岸边。他上了岸，看见前面有一座高大富丽的宫殿，便径直朝它走去。原来这是一座被施了魔法的宫殿。他走进宫殿，走遍所有房间，一间间全都空荡荡阒无一人，一直走到最后一间房间，里面盘着一条蛇。这蛇原是个少女，被施了魔法。它见了他很高兴，对他说：“你来了，我的救星？我等你等了十二年了。这个王国中了魔法，你要解救它。”



“我怎样救它？”他问。

“今天夜间有十二个带铁链的黑人会来这里，他们会问你来这里干什么；你不要作声，不要回答他们的问话，无论他们如何对待你，你都要默默忍受：他们会折磨你、打你、扎你，无论发生什么事情，你都不要说话；一到十二点，他们统统都得离开。第二天夜里会有另外十二个人来，第三夜会有二十四个人来，他们会砍下你的头，但是一到十二点他们的力量就丧失殆尽，如果你能坚持下来，一言不发，我就得救了。我会去看你，我有一瓶活命水，将它洒在你身上，你就会复活，跟原来一样神采奕奕，一样健康。”于是他说：“我很愿意救你。”一切完全像她所说的那样发生了：那些黑人无法迫使他开口，便杀死了他。第三天夜里，那条蛇变成了一位美丽的公主，带着生命之水使他复活了。她搂着他的脖子吻他，整座宫殿响起欢呼声，喜气洋洋。他们举行了盛大的婚礼，他成了金山国王。

他们一起过着幸福美满的生活，王后生了一个漂亮的男孩。过了八年，他忽然想起父亲，他心动了，很想回家看望他。王后不让他去，说：“我知道，这会造成我的不幸。”但他闹得她不安宁，她终于同意了。临分别时，她送他一枚如意戒指，说：“拿上这枚戒指，戴在手指上，你想去哪里，一会儿就到哪里，不过你得答应我：不利用它使我离开这里去见你的父亲。”他允诺她，把戒指戴在手指上，表示希望去他父亲居住的城外。转瞬之间，他已经到那里了。走到城门口，卫兵不让他进城，因为他的衣着虽然豪华鲜丽，却很奇特。于是他爬上一座山，山上有一个牧羊人，他和牧人互换衣服，穿上牧羊人的旧衣服顺利地进了城。到了父亲家里，他说出自己的姓名，但父亲无论如何也不相信他就是自己的儿子，他想他的儿子早就死了；但他看他是个贫苦可怜的牧羊人，拿来满满一盘食物给他吃。牧羊人对父母说：“我真的是你们的儿子！你们不知道我身上有一个记号吗？看了那个记号，你们就会认我了。”

“不错，”母亲说，“我们的儿子右胳膊下面有一颗深红色的痣。”他挽起衣袖，他们看见他的右胳膊下面果然有一颗深红色的痣，便不再怀疑他是否是自己的儿子。随后他告诉他们他是金山国王，他的妻子是一位公主，他们有一个七岁的儿子。父亲说：“这绝对不是真的：穿着破破烂烂的牧羊人衣服来看我的，居然是个英俊的国王？”儿子听了，勃然大怒，忘记了自己的承诺，把戒指转了一圈，说要他的妻子和儿子一起来见他。转眼间，俩人一起来了，王后哭着埋怨他说话不算数，使她遭逢不幸。他说：“我是迫不得已才这么做的，并不是故意的。”他劝慰王后，王后假装宽容，但她心中已起歹念。

他带她出城，来到当年那块庄稼地，指给她看从前推船离岸时的那条河，随后他说：“我觉得疲倦，你坐下，我靠在你怀里睡一小会儿。”他把头枕在她怀里，她给他捉虱子，直到他睡着。等他睡熟，她才把他手指上的戒指褪下来，把脚从他身子底下抽出来，只留下她的鞋，随即抱了孩子，要回到她的王国。当他一觉醒来，发现自己孤零零独自一人躺在那里，妻子孩子都已离去，戒指也已不在手指上，只有一双女鞋留在那里作凭证。“现在不能回家见父母了，”他想，“他们会说我是巫师，还是打点行装走人，回我的王国去吧。”于是他离开那里，后来走到一座山前，那里有三个巨人在争辩如何分父亲的遗产，看见他走过，把他叫住，说，小个子人聪明，要他给他们分遗产。遗产有三件：第一件是一把剑，只要把这把剑握在手里，说：“除我以外，把所有人的脑袋都砍下来。”所有的人都会人头落地；第二件是一件斗篷，谁穿上它，别人就看不见他了；第三件是一双靴子，穿上它，要去哪里，一眨眼就到。他说：“把那三件东西交给我吧，我试一试，看它们灵不灵。”他们给他那件斗篷，他一披在身上，马上隐了身形，变成一只苍蝇；然后他又恢复原形，说：“斗篷没问题，把剑给我吧。”他们说：“不行，剑我们不能给你。你一说‘除了我的头，把所有人的头都砍下来！’我们都得掉脑袋，就只有你一个人还有脑袋。”但他们终究还是把剑给他，条件是他得拿树做试验。他照办，挥剑斩断一棵树，就像割断一根麦秆。他又要那双靴子，但是他们说：“不行，靴子我们不给；把靴子给了你，你穿上它，想上山顶，我们只能站在山下，什么都没有了。”

“不，”他说，“我不会那么干的。”他们就把靴子也给了他。现在三件宝贝他都弄到手了，他一心只想着他的妻子和孩子，便自言自语：“啊，要是我现在在金山上多好啊！”霎时间，他已从巨人眼前消失，他们的遗产就这样分完了。他到了王宫附近，听见欢声笑语和拉提琴吹笛子的声音，人们告诉他，他的妻子和别人在举行婚礼。他怒气冲冲地说：“这个虚伪的女人，她欺骗我，在我熟睡时抛弃我。”他披上斗篷，隐了身形，走进宫中。到了殿堂，那里正在举行盛宴，桌上摆满美味佳肴，嘉宾满座，边吃边喝，谈笑风生。王后坐在正中的国王宝座上，衣饰华丽，头戴王冠。他站在她背后，没有一个人能看见他。他们往她的盘子里放一块肉，他就把它拿走，吃了；他们给她斟一杯葡萄酒，他就把它端走，喝了；他们不断给她斟酒上菜，可她什么也吃不到、喝不上，因为盘子、酒杯一眨眼就不见了。她又惊愕，又难为情，便站起来，回到她的房中哭泣，他尾随她进去。她说：“莫非魔鬼来害我？难道永远没有人来救我？”他打她一个耳光，说：“救你的人怎么会永远不来？他在处罚你这个女骗子。我哪点亏待你，你竟如此待我？”他现出身形，到大殿上大声宣布：“婚礼取消，真正的国王回来了！”聚集在那里的众多国王、公侯、大臣嘲弄他、讥笑他，他只直截了当地说了句：“你们出去不出去？”他们要抓他，奔到他跟前，他拔出剑说：“把除了我所有人的头都砍下来。”所有人头立刻落地，他是唯一的主人，又重新做了金山国王。





乌鸦


从前有一个王后，她有一个小女儿，小女儿还很小，还要人抱着。有一段时间孩子很淘气，不论母亲说什么，她都不肯安静。王后不耐烦了，她看见乌鸦绕着宫殿飞，便打开窗户说：“你要是变成乌鸦飞走，我才清静呢！”这话刚说出口，孩子已经变成一只乌鸦，从她怀里飞出窗外去了。那乌鸦飞进一座幽暗的森林，在里面待了很久很久，父母听不到一点她的消息。后来有一个人走进森林，听见乌鸦的叫声，顺着声音找去，走到近处，乌鸦说：“我原本是一个公主，被人施了魔法，但是你能解救我。”

“要我做些什么呢？”他问。她说：“你继续往森林深处走去，就会找到一所房子，里面有一个老太婆，她会给你吃的，给你喝的，但你一点儿都不能品尝；要是你吃了点什么，喝了点什么，就会沉睡不醒，无法救我。屋后花园里有一棵大橡树，你要站在那里等我。三天里我每天中午两点乘马车来这里找你，第一天拉车的是四匹白马，接着是四匹红马，最后是四匹黑马；如果你沉睡不醒，我就无法得救。”那男人许诺做她要求的一切。乌鸦却说：“啊，我现在就已知道你是救不了我的，你会吃老太婆给你的东西。”那男子许诺不论食物还是饮料，他都绝不碰它。但他一走进那所房子，老太婆就迎着他走过来，说：“可怜的人啊，你疲惫不堪了，快来休息一会儿，吃点东西，喝口酒吧。”

“不，”那男人说，“我不想吃，也不想喝。”但她总劝他，不让他安宁，她说：“如果你不想吃，那就从酒杯里喝一口吧，一口酒算不了什么。”他终于被说动了，喝了。下午快到两点的时候，他去花园里，在老橡树的大树根上等候乌鸦。他站在那里，突然感到非常疲乏，支持不住，便躺下打算休息一会儿。他并不想睡觉，可是刚一躺下，眼睛就自己闭上，他睡着了，睡得很死，任世上无论什么都不能把他叫醒。午后两点，乌鸦乘坐四匹白马拉的马车前来，但她神色非常悲伤，她说：“我知道他会睡着的。”当她来到花园，他仍躺在老橡树的大树根上熟睡。她从马车上下来，走到他身边，摇晃他，呼唤他，他都不醒。第二天中午时分，老太婆又来了，给他带来食物和饮料。他不肯接受。但她老是缠着他，使他无法安宁，劝了他很久，他终于又从酒杯里喝了一口酒。快两点的时候，他去到花园里，踏上老橡树的树根，等候乌鸦到来，忽然感到异常疲惫，四肢支持不住，毫无办法，只好躺下，又陷入深沉的睡眠。乌鸦乘四匹红马拉的马车驶来，神色十分悲伤，她说：“我知道他会睡着的。”她走到他身旁，但他躺着睡熟了，叫不醒他。第三天老太婆说：“这是怎么回事？不吃不喝，是不是想寻死？”他回答说：“我不想吃喝，也不被允许吃喝。”但她把一碗食物和一杯葡萄酒放在他面前，香味扑鼻，使他无法抗拒；他喝了一大口葡萄酒。时候到了，他走到花园老橡树树根上等候公主，感到比前两天更疲倦，躺下睡得很死，就像一块石头。两点钟的时候，乌鸦乘四匹黑马拉的马车前来，马车和所有的一切全都是黑色的。她神色十分悲伤地说：“我知道他会睡着的，他救不了我。”她走到他身边，他躺在那里，睡得很深沉。她摇晃他、喊他，都无法把他叫醒。于是她把一块面包放在他身旁，又放上一块肉，最后是一瓶葡萄酒。这三样东西他想吃多少，就吃多少，永远不会变少。末了，她又从自己手指上褪下一枚刻着她的名字的金戒指，把它戴在他的手指上。最后放上一封信，信里写着她给他的东西，并说这些东西是永远用不完的。她在信里写道：“我十分明白，在这里你是无法救我的，如果你还想救我，就到大河山的金宫去，在那里你能救我，这一点我很清楚。”她把这些东西给了那个男人，然后上车，向大河山的金宫驶去。

那人醒来，知道自己睡着了，心里很悲哀，他说：“毫无疑义，她现在坐车走了，我没能拯救她。”这时，他身边的那些东西映入他的眼帘，他读那封写着事情经过的信。他站起来，要去大河山金宫，但不知道大河山金宫在什么地方。他浪迹四方，过了很长时间，后来来到一座森林，走了十四天还没能走出森林，已经又是夜晚，他疲惫不堪地躺在一丛灌木旁边睡着了。第二天继续走，晚上他又想在一丛灌木旁边躺下，却听见呼喊号叫的声音，无法入睡。到了上灯的时候，他看见一点灯光闪烁，便站起来尾随灯光前行，来到一所房子跟前。一个巨人站在房前，房子因而显得很小。他在心里暗想：如果径直往屋里走去，巨人看见了，很容易丢了性命。但他终于壮起胆子走上前去。巨人看见他，说道：“你来了，很好，我很久没吃到一点东西了，我要马上把你当晚饭吃掉。”

“这样不好，”那人说，“我可不喜欢让人吃掉，如果你要吃的，我有的是，保证让你吃个饱。”

“真是这样，”巨人说，“你就不必担心了。我是因为什么吃的东西都没有，才想吃你。”于是他们走到桌旁坐下，那人取出永远不变少的面包、肉、葡萄酒。“这个我很喜欢！”巨人说，吃得非常痛快。吃完饭，那人问巨人：“你能告诉我大河山金宫在哪里吗？”巨人说：“我要查看我的地图，所有城市、村庄，所有房屋，我的地图上都有。”地图放在他的房间里，他拿出来，找大河山的金宫，但地图上没有。“没关系，”他说，“我的柜橱顶上还有几张更大的地图，我们可以找找。”可是那些地图上也没有。那人要继续往前走，巨人请他再等几天，等他外出取食物的兄弟回家。巨人的兄弟回来后，他们问他大河山的金宫在哪里，他回答说：“等我吃饱了，我就在地图上找找。”吃完饭后，他带他们到他的房间，可是在他的地图上也没能找到它，他又拿了一些别的旧地图来不停地查找，终于找到了大河山的金宫，但它却在好几千里外。“我怎样才能到那里去呢？”那人问。巨人说：“我有两个钟头时间，我把你背到金宫附近，就得回家给我们的孩子喂奶。”说着巨人背起那人，走到离金宫约有上百小时路程的地方，他说：“剩下的路你一个人走应该没问题了。”说罢，便往回走。那人日夜赶路，终于来到大河山的金宫。但金宫坐落在一座玻璃山上，中了魔法的公主坐在她的马车里围绕金宫兜圈，然后进宫。他看见她，心里非常高兴，要上山去找她，但无论他怎么走法，总是从玻璃山上滑下来。她可望而不可即，他心中十分悲伤，对自己说：“我要留在这儿的山下等她。”于是他建造一间小屋，在里面住了整整一年，天天看见她在山上乘车出行，始终无法上山找她。

有一天，他从小屋里面看见三个强盗在打斗，他冲他们大声喊道：“上帝保佑你们！”强盗听见喊声，停下不打了，可是他们看不见人，便又打起来，互相往死里打。他又喊一声：“上帝保佑你们！”他们又住手不打了，环视周围，不见有人，又继续恶斗。这时他第三次喊：“上帝保佑你们！”心里想：得去看看这三个究竟是怎么回事，于是走出去问他们为什么厮打。一个说他得到一根棍子，用它打门，门就开；一个说他得到一件斗篷，披在身上就能隐身；第三个说他捉到一匹马，骑上它哪儿都能去，也能登上玻璃山。他们不知道应该共同保管这些东西，还是各自使用自己的。那人听了，说：“我想和你们换这三件东西，我虽然没有钱，但是有一些比金钱更有价值的东西！不过我得先试一试，看你们说的是不是真话。”于是他们让他骑上马，给他披上斗篷，把棍子放在他手里，他有了这三件东西，他们就看不见他了。他狠狠揍了他们一顿，大声说道：“你们这些懒汉，这就是你们该得到的，满意了吧？”随即策马奔上玻璃山。山上宫门紧闭，他用那棍子击打宫门，大门立即打开。他走进宫殿，踏上台阶，一直来到高高的殿堂。公主坐在殿堂上，她面前有一只金杯，盛满了葡萄酒。她看不见他，因为他身上披着隐身斗篷。当他走到她跟前，把她送他的戒指从手指上褪下来，扔进酒杯里，发出响声。公主大声说：“这是我的戒指，要来救我的男人一定在这里。”人们寻遍了整座宫殿，找不到他，原来他已经走出金宫，跨上马，抛下斗篷。人们奔到金宫大门口，看见了他，高兴得欢呼起来。于是他下马，把公主拥在怀里，她吻他，说：“现在你救了我，我们明天就举行婚礼吧！”





聪明的农家女


从前有一个贫穷的农夫，他没有土地，只有一所小房子和一个独生女儿。女儿说：“我们最好请求国王给我们一块荒地。”国王听了他们贫困的情况，送了一块草地给他们。女儿和父亲去翻地，想种点粮食之类。那块地快翻完了，从地里掘出一个纯金的臼。“你听我说，”父亲对女儿说，“我们的国王非常仁慈，送给我们这块地，我们得把臼送给他表示感谢。”女儿不同意，她说：“父亲，我们有臼，没有杵，还得去找杵，所以不要声张为好。”但父亲不肯听她的话，带上金臼去见国王，说是他在荒野找到的，为对国王表示敬意，请他收下。国王接过臼，问还找到什么别的没有？农夫回答说：“没有。”国王说，他得把杵拿来。农夫说他们没发现杵。可是没用，就像是说给风听似的。他被关进监牢，要他拿出杵来，才会放他出去。仆役天天给他送水和面包，蹲监牢的人得到的就是这些。他们听见农夫不停地哭喊：“唉，要是听我女儿的话就好了！”仆役去见国王，说犯人不吃也不喝，不停地哭喊：“唉，要是听我女儿的话就好了！”国王叫仆役把犯人带来，亲自问他为什么老是哭喊，“你女儿到底说了些什么？”

农夫答道：“她说我最好不要送臼来，要送也得等找到杵再送。”

“你真有这么一个聪明的女儿，就叫她来见我。”于是他女儿来见国王。国王问她是不是当真那么聪明，说要给她出一个谜，她若能猜中，就和她结婚。她马上说可以，她能猜中。国王说：“你到我这里来，不穿衣服，不赤裸身子，不骑马，不乘车，不从路上来，也不从路外来，如果你能做到，我就娶你为妻。”女儿回去，脱得赤条条一丝不挂，她没穿衣服；拿一张大渔网，坐在渔网里面把自己包起来，她没有赤裸身子；她雇了一头驴，把渔网绑在驴尾巴上，让驴子拖着渔网和她一起走，她没骑马，也没乘车；驴子走在车辙上，她只双脚大脚趾着地，不在路上，不在路外。她这样前去，国王说她猜中了，满足了一切要求，于是把她父亲从监牢释放出来，娶她为妻，命令她管理王室的一切财富。

过了几年，有一次国王去阅兵，刚巧有农夫卖完木材，他们的车停在王宫前面，有的车是公牛拉的，有的车是马拉的。有一个农夫有四匹马，其中一匹生了一只小马驹，小马驹跑到一辆车前面，在两头公牛之间躺了下来。农夫聚拢来，开始争吵，摔东西，大声喧哗。有公牛的农夫想要小马驹，说马驹是公牛生的；另一个农夫说不对，是他的马生的小马驹，小马驹是他的。吵吵嚷嚷的声音传到国王那里，国王传下口谕：小马驹躺在谁那儿，它就是谁的。于是有牛的农夫得到了小马驹，可马驹确实不是他的。另一个农夫走了，为失去小马驹而哭泣，而诉苦。他听说王后也是穷苦农户出身，十分仁慈，于是去见王后，请求她帮助他要回他的马驹。王后说：“可以，如果你答应我不说是我说的，我就告诉你该怎么办。明天一大早，国王检阅卫队，你在他一定要经过的大路上站住，拿一张大渔网，不停地做出撒网打鱼、抖渔网，好像打了满网鱼的样子。”她还告诉他如果国王问话，他应如何回答。于是农夫第二天就站在一块干地上撒网打鱼。国王经过时看见了，派传令兵去问那个傻瓜在干什么。农夫回答说：“我在打鱼。”传令兵问，这里并没有水，怎么能打鱼。农夫说：“两头公牛会生一匹小马驹，我在干地上也能打鱼。”传令兵回去向国王报告，国王把农夫叫去，问这话是不是他自己想出来的，要他马上说出是谁教他的。农夫不说是谁教的，只是翻来覆去说上帝保佑！这话是他自己想出来的。他们把他放在一捆干草上拷打很长时间，直至他供认是王后教他的。

国王回到家里，对王后说：“你为什么对我这么虚伪？我要把你休了，你的美好时光结束了！你从哪里来，还回哪里去，回到你的农夫小屋去吧。”但他仍允许她带走一件她认为最可爱、最美好的东西，作为别离的礼物。她说：“好吧，亲爱的丈夫，如果你这样命令，我也愿意遵命照办。”说着，便扑过去抱住他亲吻，说要同他告别。她叫人送来效力很强的安眠药酒，和国王饮酒道别。国王喝一大口，她只呷了一点儿。国王很快睡着了，睡得很深沉。她叫来一名侍役，用一条洁白美丽的亚麻床单把国王包裹起来，叫侍役把他抬进停在宫门前的一辆马车里，她驾着马车回家了，回到她那小小的农舍。她把他放在她的床上，他日夜熟睡，醒来时望着周围，说：“上帝啊，这是什么地方？”他呼唤侍从，但这里一个侍从也没有。他的妻子终于来到床前，说：“亲爱的国王，你曾经命令我，要我带走宫中一件我最心爱、最美好的东西，除了你，再没有什么是我认为更美好、更心爱的，所以我把你带回来了。”国王眼睛里饱含热泪，他说：“亲爱的妻子，你是我的，我是你的。”他把她又带回王宫，和她重新举行婚礼。他们很可能直到如今还在人世。





三只小鸟


大约一千多年前，这片土地上有许多小国的国王，其中有一个国王住在科伊特山上。那国王非常喜欢打猎。有一天，他带猎人走出王宫，山下有三个姑娘在放牛，她们看见国王和众多随从，年长的姑娘指着国王对另外两个说：“喂！喂！我就要和这个人结婚，不嫁给别人。”山那边的另一个姑娘指着国王右边一个人回答说：“喂！喂！我就要和这人结婚，不嫁给别人。”年纪最小的女孩指着国王左边一个人说：“喂！喂！我就要和这人结婚，不嫁给别人。”他们是国王的两个大臣。她们这些话国王都听到了。打猎归来后，国王把那三个姑娘叫来，问她们昨天在山下说些什么。她们不说。国王问年长的姑娘，是不是想嫁给他，她说是的；两个大臣也问了另外两个妹妹并娶了她们。她们姐妹三人全都容貌清秀可人。王后尤其美丽，她有一头亚麻色的秀发。

两个妹妹婚后一直没有生育。有一次，国王要出去旅行，因为王后正怀孕在身，为了使她快乐，便叫她们来陪伴她。他走后王后生了一个男孩，一生下来，身上就有一颗红痣。两个妹妹心生嫉妒，商量要把这漂亮的男孩扔到河里。她们把他扔进河里时（我想是威悉河[1]西段），一只鸟儿飞上天空唱道：





你会不会死去，

变成一束百合花，

以后才能知道：

这是你吗，勇敢的男孩？





两人听了，十分害怕，慌忙跑开了。国王回来，她们对国王说，王后生了一只狗。国王说：“上帝做事，总有道理。”

一个渔夫住在河边，他把小男孩从河里捞出来，孩子还活着，恰巧他的妻子不生孩子，就把孩子收养了起来。一年后，国王再次出门旅行，王后又生了一个男孩，两个恶毒的妹妹又把孩子扔进河里；那只小鸟又飞上天空唱道：





你会不会死去，

变成一束百合花，

以后才能知道：

这是你吗，勇敢的男孩？





国王回来，她们对他说，王后又生了一只狗，国王仍然说：“上帝做事，总有道理。”恰好这个小男孩又被渔夫从河里捞起来收养了。

国王又出去旅行，王后生了一个女孩，两个虚伪的妹妹又把这孩子扔进河里。小鸟儿又飞上天空唱道：





你会不会死去，

变成一束百合花，

以后才能知道：

这是你吗，勇敢的女孩？





国王回来后，她们告诉国王说，王后生了一只猫。国王大怒，把王后投入监狱。王后在狱中度过了很多年。

孩子们渐渐长大，有一天，大孩子和别的男孩一起出去钓鱼，那些男孩不愿意和他待在一起，他们说：“你这弃儿，滚开吧！”他很伤心，问老渔夫这是不是真的。渔夫告诉他，是他有一天打鱼时把他从水里捞上来的。男孩说要去找亲生父亲。渔夫挽留他，但他无论如何一定要走，最后渔夫只好答应了。于是他起身上路，连续走了几天，终于来到一条大河边，有一个老太婆在那里打鱼。“你好，老妈妈。”男孩说。

“你好。”她回应道。

“你要很长时间才能钓到一条鱼吧？”

“你大概要找很久才能找到你的父亲。你怎么过这条河呢？”老太婆说。

“是啊，这只有上帝知道。”老太婆把他背过河去。他寻找了很久，一直没能找到父亲。过了一年，第二个孩子要离开家里去找他的哥哥。他走到河边，遇到的情形和他的哥哥完全一样。现在只有小女孩独自一人留在家里，她想念两个哥哥，终日哭泣，最后也请求渔夫让她去寻找她的哥哥。她也来到那条大河边，她对那个老太婆说：“你好，老妈妈。”

“你好。”老婆婆说。

“上帝保佑你打到鱼。”老太太听了这话，态度变得十分和蔼可亲，把她背过河去，并给她一根树枝，对她说：“沿着这条路一直走下去，我的孩子，当你从一只大黑狗旁边走过去的时候，不要惊慌，你静静地走过去，不要出声，不要笑，不要看它。然后你会来到一座大宫殿前，宫殿大门敞开着，你让这树枝掉在门槛上，穿过宫殿，从另一头出来；那儿有一口古井，井上长着一棵大树，树上挂着一个鸟笼，笼里关着一只鸟，你把它拿下来，再从古井里取一杯水，然后带着这两件东西从原路回来，也带上门槛上的树枝，再次从那只大黑狗旁边走过的时候，用树枝打狗的脸，可是要小心，务必打到它的脸上，然后再回到我这儿来。”一路上她遇到的情形和老太婆所说的完全一样。回来的路上她遇见她的两个哥哥，他们互相寻找，已经寻遍了半个世界。他们一块儿走到黑狗躺着的路旁，她打中了狗的脸，于是那只狗变成一个英俊的王子，随他们一起来到河边。老婆婆还在河边，看见他们都回来了，非常高兴，把他们一个个背到河对岸，她也离开了，因为她自己也获救了。大家都回到老渔夫那里，欢聚一堂，非常高兴，他们把鸟儿挂在墙上。

但是二儿子不愿在家休息，他拿了一张弓出去打猎，累了，就取出笛子吹奏一曲。正巧国王也在打猎，听见了笛声，便走过去，遇见了年轻人。国王问：“是谁允许你在这里打猎的？”

“哦，没有谁允许。”

“你是谁家的孩子？”

“我是渔夫的儿子。”

“渔夫没有儿子啊。”

“你要是不信，就跟我一起去。”国王前去问渔夫，渔夫向他详述一切，这时墙上的鸟儿开始唱道：





母亲孤零零，

关在监牢里，

啊，高贵的国王，

他们是你的好儿女。

两个恶毒的妹妹，

要害死你的孩子，

把他们抛进深深的河里，

渔夫发现他们在水里。





大家听了，都很吃惊。于是国王把鸟儿、渔夫和三个孩子带回王宫，下令打开监狱，接出王后，她身染重病，十分憔悴。她的女儿让她喝几口古井水，她又神采奕奕，恢复了健康。两个恶毒的妹妹被烧死，公主和那位获救王子结了婚。

生命水


从前有一个国王病了，谁都不相信他还能活下去。国王有三个儿子，为父亲病重异常悲伤，走到宫中花园里去哭泣。一位老者遇见他们，问他们为什么如此忧伤。他们告诉他父亲病重，可能会身亡，他们无法救他一命，因此悲伤。老者说：“我知道有个办法，那就是生命水，饮用一点生命水，就能恢复健康。但要得到它是很难的。”大王子说：“我一定要找到这生命水。”他去见重病的国王，请求准许他出去寻找生命水，因为唯有它能治好国王的病。“不，”国王说，“这太危险了，我宁愿死，也不让你去。”但王子再三恳求，国王终于同意了。王子心里暗自想道：“如果我取了生命水，我就是父亲最宠爱的人，就能继承王位。”

于是他启程，策马走了一些时候，遇见一个小矮人站在路上大声喊他，说：“你急急忙忙要去哪里？”

“蠢侏儒，”王子傲慢地说，“我去哪里你管得着吗？”说罢，骑马走了。小矮人十分恼火，对他诅咒一通。过不多久，王子骑马奔入峡谷，越往前骑，山路越窄，到了后来，竟狭窄得既无法前进，也不能勒转马头往回走，甚至无法下马，他骑在马上就像被锁住了似的。病中的国王盼他盼了很久，总不见他回来。于是二王子说：“父亲，让我去找生命水吧！”他心里想：“要是大哥死了，王国就非我莫属了。”国王起初不让他去，后来终于让步。二王子还走他大哥走过的那条路，同样遇见那个小矮人。小矮人拦住他，问他这么匆忙要去哪里。“蠢侏儒，”王子说，“我去哪里你管得着吗！”说罢，骑马就走，也不回头看一下。小矮人诅咒他，他也跟他哥哥一样，陷在峡谷，进退不得。这就是傲慢的人的报应。

二王子也一去不复返，小王子便自告奋勇，要去寻取生命水，国王无奈，最后也只好让他去。他遇见小矮人，小矮人问他匆忙赶路要去哪里，他勒住马回答说：“父亲病重，生命垂危，我要去找生命水。”

“你知道哪里能找到生命水吗？”

“不知道。”小王子说。

“你待人有礼，不像你那两个心术不正的哥哥那样傲慢，所以我愿意指点你怎样才能找到生命水。生命水是从一口井泉喷涌出来的，这井泉就在一座被施了魔法的宫殿的庭院里。可是，如果我不给你一根铁棒和两个小圆面包，你就无法进入王宫。你用铁棒击打三下宫殿的铁门，大门就会打开。门内躺着两只狮子，张开大口，你往每只狮子口中扔一个小圆面包，它们就安静了。你要赶在钟敲十二点之前取出生命水，否则，一到十二点，宫殿铁门又再关上，你就要被关在里面了。”王子谢过他，接过铁棒和面包，继续往前走。到了那里，一切和小矮人所说的完全吻合。他用铁棒击打三下宫门，宫门开了，狮子得到面包，不再咆哮了。他走进宫中，来到一座宽敞美丽的厅堂，那里坐着许多中了巫术的王子，他取下他们手指上的戒指，那里有一把剑和一块面包，他也都捡起来一起带走。他又走进一间房间，一位美丽的少女站在房中，见了他非常高兴，她吻他，告诉他说，他解救了她，她要把她的整个王国奉送给他，如果他一年后还来这里，就和他举行婚礼。她又告诉他生命水的井泉在哪里，叫他务必抓紧时间，在钟敲十二点之前舀水出宫。他继续朝前走，终于来到一间房间，里面有一张刚铺好的漂亮的床，他累极了，想暂且休息片刻。一躺下去，就睡着了，醒来时，钟正敲十一点三刻。他大吃一惊，一跃而起，飞奔去井泉，拿放在井边的一只酒杯从井里舀一杯水，便匆匆离去。刚刚跑到铁门，正好钟敲十二下，铁门猛然关闭，把他的鞋跟切掉一块。

他为自己获得了生命水而欣喜，归途上又遇见小矮人。小矮人看见那把剑和面包，说：“你赢得了巨大的财富，用这把剑你可以打败一支大军，这面包是永远吃不完的。”没有两个哥哥，小王子不愿自己回去见他父亲，他说：“亲爱的侏儒，你能告诉我，我的两个哥哥在哪里吗？他们在我之前出门去找生命水，还没回家。”

“他们被夹在两座山之间，”侏儒说，“是我发咒语引他们去的，因为他们太傲慢了。”王子再三恳求，小矮人终于把他们放出来，但他告诫王子说：“要提防他们！这两人心黑手狠。”

两个哥哥来了，小王子很高兴，向他们讲述他的经历，告诉他们他找到了并取了一杯生命水，还解救了一位美丽的公主，公主要等他一年，然后和他结婚，随后他会得到一个很大的王国。三兄弟一路骑马同行，来到一个国度，那里正发生饥馑和战乱，苦难极其深重，连国王自己都认为难逃灭顶之灾。小王子去见他，给他那只面包，让全国的人们都来吃，吃得很饱，小王子又给他宝剑，让他用这把剑打败敌军。一切顺利，这国王使人民重新过上了和平安宁的生活。小王子收回他的面包和宝剑，三兄弟继续前行。他们还到过两个饥荒和战乱肆虐的国家，小王子都给国王面包和宝剑，就这样拯救了三个国家。随后他们乘船渡海，航行途中，两个哥哥暗自商议：“我们没找到生命水，而三弟找到了，为此父亲会把本来属于我们的王位传给他，他会夺走我们的幸福。”于是他们一心一意想要报复，相互勾结，要加害于小王子。有一天，他们等小王子睡熟了，倒出酒杯里的生命水，据为己有，又在酒杯里换上苦涩的海水。



当他们回到家里，小王子把他的酒杯送到生病的国王跟前，让他饮用，以求恢复健康。国王才喝了一小口苦涩的海水，病情加重了。他伤心悲诉的时候，大王子二王子前来告状，说小王子企图毒死国王，他们给他带来的才是真正的生命水，并把水递给国王。国王一喝，立时感觉病痛全部消失，又像青年时代那样有力和健康。事后，这两人去找小王子，奚落他说：“虽然生命水是你找到的，但你是白辛苦，我们得好处。你要真是聪明，早该睁大眼睛盯着。我们趁你在海上熟睡之机，拿了你的生命水，一年后，我们两个之中的一个还要去接那位美丽的公主。你可要当心，不要泄漏一个字！现在父亲不信任你了，只要你说出去一个字，就叫你性命难保。如果你保持沉默，可以饶你不死。”

老国王以为幼子要害他性命，非常生气。于是召集宫中大臣，商议如何处置小王子，最后决定秘密枪杀他。有一天，小王子骑马去打猎，丝毫没有料到会有什么凶险，国王的猎人奉命随他前往。到了森林里，俩人单独在一起的时候，猎人的神色十分悲伤。王子对他说：“亲爱的猎人，你哪儿不舒服吗？”猎人说：“我不能说，但又非说不可。”王子说：“有什么事你就说吧，我原谅你。”猎人说：“国王命令我射杀你。”王子大惊，说：“亲爱的猎人，给我一条生路吧，我把我华美的衣服给你，你把你的旧衣服给我。”猎人说：“我很愿意这么做，我本来就不忍心射死你。”于是俩人换穿衣服，猎人回家，王子继续往密林深处走去。

若干时日之后，有三辆车子满载着黄金、宝石，拉到老国王那里，要送给他的幼子。原来这是借助王子的宝剑击败敌人，用王子的面包使国人吃饱肚子的那三位国王送来表示感谢的礼物。于是老国王暗想：“莫非我的小儿子是清白无辜的？”他对他的臣下说：“要是他仍在人世就好了，我命人杀死他，现在真是痛心。”

“他还活着，”猎人说，“我不忍心执行您的命令。”他向国王讲了事情经过。国王心上一块石头落地了，他向各国通报，允许他的幼子回国，并要善待他。

那位公主命人在宫殿前面修筑一条纯金的闪闪发光的大道，她对她的随从说，从这条大道上径直骑马来的，是解救过她的王子，要让他进去；从旁边来的，不是救过她的人，不能放他进去。一年之期快到了，大王子想赶快去公主那儿，伪称是解救过她的王子，以便娶她为妻子，并得到那个王国。他骑马前往，来到宫前，看见美丽的黄金大道，心想：“骑马在这上面走太可惜了。”便勒转马头，骑马从右边奔去。来到宫殿门前，人们对他说，他不是解救过公主的王子，叫他回去。过了不久，二王子动身来到黄金大道，他的坐骑一踩在路面上，他想：“骑马在这上面走太可惜了。”便勒转马头，从左边过去。来到宫殿门前，人们对他说，他不是解救过公主的王子，叫他回去。整整一年的时间过去了，小王子走出森林，准备骑马奔向他亲爱的未婚妻，在她身旁忘掉他的痛苦。于是他启程，一路上心里只惦念着她，恨不能立刻飞到她身旁，根本没注意黄金大道。他骑马在黄金大道上疾驰，来到宫殿门前，大门立即敞开，公主欣喜地迎出来，说是他拯救了她，随即喜气洋洋地举行婚礼。婚礼完毕，公主告诉王子，他父亲已召唤他回去，不怪罪他了。于是他骑马回去，把两个哥哥如何欺骗他，他始终隐忍等情况全部告诉父亲。老国王要惩罚他们，但他们已经乘船从海上逃到远方，终生不再回来。





两个漫游者


山和谷不相遇，好人和坏人会碰面。有一天，一个鞋匠和一个裁缝在漫游途中走到一起来了。裁缝是个小个子男人，总是心情愉快。他看见鞋匠迎面走来，看他的工匠背囊就知道他是干哪一门手艺的，他冲着他唱一支讽刺小曲：





给我缝好鞋缝，

给我拉紧鞋线，

鞋帮涂上沥青，

牢牢钉上鞋钉。





鞋匠听了受不了，脸上酸溜溜的，像喝了醋似的，一副要和小裁缝拼命的架势。小裁缝却笑了，把自己的酒瓶递给鞋匠，说：“我没有恶意，喝口酒吧，消消气。”鞋匠喝了一大口，脸上的乌云就消散了。他把酒瓶还给裁缝，说道：“我喝了一大口，人说喝得很多，但不说喝得厉害。我们一起漫游好吗？”

“很好，”裁缝回答说，“如果你想去大城市的话，那里有活干。”

“我也正想去大城市，”鞋匠说，“在小镇赚不到什么钱，乡下人更喜欢光脚丫子走路。”于是他们一起继续漫游，像雪地里的黄鼠狼一样，不停地移动双脚朝前走。

时间他们两个有的是，就是没有什么吃的。他们到了一个城市，就到处走走，探望同行。因为小裁缝性情爽朗愉快，又长着俊俏的红扑扑的腮帮，人人都乐意送给他些东西，运气好的话，师傅的女儿还会在家门口给他一个吻，送他上路。又和鞋匠会合的时候，他背包里的东西总要比鞋匠多些。性情阴郁乖僻的鞋匠拉长了脸说：“人越无赖越是有福。”小裁缝却又是笑又是唱歌，无论得到什么东西，全都和鞋匠分享。他口袋里如果有几枚银币叮当响，就下饭馆，高兴得拍桌子，拍得酒杯在桌上跳起舞来，他这人正是：“钱赚得容易花得也快。”

他们漫游了一段时间，来到一座大森林附近，通往京城的路就穿过这座森林。人走的小路有两条，一条要走七天，另一条只要走两天，但他们谁也不知道哪一条是近路。两个漫游者坐在橡树下商量该带些什么东西，带吃几天的面包。鞋匠说：“不能光想顺利的情况，我要带七天吃的面包。”

“什么！”裁缝说，“像头驴子那样背着七天吃的面包？那就连转过头看看周围都不行了。我依靠上帝，别的事我不管。我口袋里的钱，夏天和冬天都一样好用，可是面包天热就会干巴，还会发霉。带够吃的面包就行了，不要带太多。我们怎么就找不到近路呢？带两天吃的面包就行了。”于是俩人各自买自己吃的面包，然后走进森林去碰运气。

森林里面静悄悄的，像教堂里面一样。没有风吹树叶沙沙响，没有溪水潺潺，没有鸟儿鸣啭，没有阳光透过树枝的浓荫照射进来。鞋匠一声不吭，沉甸甸的面包压得他满头大汗，汗水从他闷闷不乐的阴沉的脸上往下流淌。裁缝的兴致很好，他跳来跳去，拿一片树叶吹哨子，要不就唱一支小曲，心里想道：“天上的上帝看我这样快乐，一定会很高兴。”这样过了两天，第三天裁缝的面包吃完了，还没有快要走出森林的模样，裁缝的心猛往下沉，但他并未因此丧失勇气，他信赖上帝，相信自己会有好运。第三天晚上他饿着肚子躺在一棵树下，早晨又饿着肚子爬起来。第四天也是如此。鞋匠坐在一棵倒下的树上吃饭，裁缝只能瞧着他干瞪眼。他向鞋匠讨一小块面包，鞋匠讥笑他说：“你一向那么快活，现在也可以尝一尝不快活是什么滋味。早晨唱歌唱得太早的小鸟儿晚上会被老鹰叼走的。”一句话，此人没有同情心。可是第五天早晨，裁缝爬不起来了，他疲乏无力，几乎说不出一句话；他的脸颊苍白，双眼血红。鞋匠对他说：“今天我要给你一块面包，但是要把你的右眼挖出来。”不幸的裁缝要活命，没有办法，他双眼泪流，然后抬起头来，铁石心肠的鞋匠用一把锋利的刀子把他的右眼挖了出来。这时裁缝想起从前他在储藏食物的房间偷吃甜食以后母亲说过的话：能吃多少就吃多少，必须忍受就得忍受。他吃完以高昂的代价换来的面包后，又站起来继续走，忘记了他的不幸，并且安慰自己说，他有一只眼睛就能够看清楚了。但到了第六天，他又饥肠辘辘，一颗心几乎都要碎了。晚上，他躺倒在一棵树旁边，第七天早晨他已经没有力气爬起来，死到临头了。鞋匠说：“我要行善事，再给你一次面包，但不能白给，得挖掉你另一只眼睛。”裁缝这才认识到自己生活的轻率，请求亲爱的上帝宽恕他，他说：“你要怎么干，就动手吧，我要忍受我必须忍受的；但是，你好好想一想，我们的主不是每时每刻都在审判，另外一个时刻会到来的，那时候你对我的暴行就会得到报应。我没有对不起你的地方，我有好日子过的时候，我和你分享我的所有。我的手艺需要我一针一针地缝，如果我没有眼睛，无法缝纫，我就只能乞讨度日。我要是瞎了，你可不能把我一个人扔在这里，那我就得饿死了。”鞋匠的心里已经没有上帝，他拿起刀，把裁缝的左眼挖出来，然后拿一块面包给他吃，递给他一根棍子，牵着他走。

日落时分，他们走出森林，森林附近的田野上立着一个绞架。鞋匠领着盲裁缝走到那里，让他躺下，就自己走了。不幸的裁缝非常疲劳，又疼又饿，他睡着了，睡了整整一夜。晨光熹微中，他醒了，却不知道自己身在何处。绞架上吊着两个可怜的罪人，这两人头顶上都蹲着一只乌鸦。这时，一个吊死鬼说“：兄弟，你醒了吗？”

“醒了。”另一个说。“那我告诉你件事，”第一个又开口说，“昨天夜里从我们头顶绞架上落下的露水，拿去洗眼，会使人重见光明。要是盲人们知道这样能重新获得视力，有些人恐怕还不信呢。”裁缝听了，拿起毛巾按在草上，沾湿露水，揩擦眼睛。吊死鬼说的话，果然应验了，裁缝的眼窝里立刻重现一对清新健康的眼睛。没过多久，裁缝看见太阳从山后面升起，在他面前的平原上，就是伟大的京城，华丽的城门，上百座塔楼，塔尖上的金球和十字架开始闪亮。他能分得清树上的每一片树叶，看得见飞掠而过的鸟儿和在空中跳舞的蚊子。他从口袋里取出一根缝衣针，当他和从前一样把线穿过针眼，他的心里真是乐开了花。他跪在地上，感谢上帝赐予他的恩惠，做了晨祷，也没忘记为那两个像大钟的钟摆一样在风中摇摆、互相碰撞的罪人求祈。接着他背上行李，不久就忘了所遭受的苦难，唱着歌吹着口哨继续往前走。

他首先遇到一匹棕色马驹在田野上自由地欢蹦乱跳。他抓住马鬃毛，正要跃上马背，骑马进城，马驹求他放了它，说：“我还太年幼，像你这么轻的裁缝骑上来也会压断我的脊背，放了我吧，等我长壮实了，也许将来可以报答你。”

“去吧，”裁缝说，“我看你也是个顽皮的小子。”他用树枝抽一下马背，小马驹尥蹶子撒欢，跃过树篱和壕沟，向着原野奔去。

从昨天起，小裁缝就没吃过一点东西。“阳光虽然充满我的眼睛，”他说，“但是我的嘴里没有面包。我一定不放过最先碰到的勉强能吃的东西。”这时，一只鹳神态庄严地从草地上阔步走来。“停一下！停一下！”裁缝喊道，抓住它的腿，“我不知道能不能吃你，可是我饿极了，别无选择，我得剁下你的脑袋，把你烤了。”

“别这么干，”鹳回答说，“我是能给人类带来大益处的圣鸟，谁都不伤害我。要是你放了我，我下次会报答你的。”

“那就走吧，长腿老弟。”裁缝说。鹳鸟飞起来，垂下一双长腿，从容飞走了。

“怎么办？”裁缝自言自语，“我越来越饿，肚子越来越空。现在我要是碰上什么，准叫它没命。”这时他看见池塘里游过来几只小鸭。“你们来得正是时候。”他说着逮住一只，正要拧断它的脖子，躲在芦苇里的一只老母鸭游过来，张大鸭嘴，恳求他怜悯它亲爱的孩子们。“你想一想，”老母鸭说，“如果有人要把你抓走，干掉你，你母亲会多么悲伤！”

“别说了，”善良的裁缝说，“领走你的孩子吧。”说着，把捉住的小鸭又放回水中。

他回过身来，面前是一棵半空的树，野蜂在那里飞进飞出。“我做了好事，马上就要获得报答了，”裁缝说，“蜂蜜会使我恢复精力。”但是蜂王出来威胁他说：“如果你碰一下我们，毁坏我们的蜂巢，我们的刺会像千百支烧红的针扎进你的皮肉里去。但是，你如果让我们安安生生过日子，走你的路，以后我们会报答你的。”

小裁缝看出这里也搞不出什么名堂。“三只碗是空的，第四只也是空碗，这顿饭真差劲。”他饿着肚子，拖着疲惫的身体进城，那时正好是吃午饭的时候，饭馆里已经为他准备好了饭菜，他一坐下，马上就能吃饭。吃饱了，他说：“现在我也要干活了。”他在城里各处转悠，找到一位师傅，很快也就找到一个不错的工作。因为他的手艺学得很好，不久就出名了，大家都要找小裁缝定做新衣服。他的名声一天比一天响亮。“我的技术虽然不能再提高了，还是一天比一天更棒。”终于，国王任用他为宫廷裁缝师。

世上的事就有这么凑巧：就在同一天，他原来的漫游伙伴——鞋匠，也当上了宫廷鞋匠。鞋匠看见裁缝，一见他又有了一双健康的眼睛，心里很不是滋味。“没等他来报复我，”他在心里暗自想道，“我得先设计除掉他。”但是，设计害人的，会自己遭殃。傍晚，鞋匠收工后，暮色苍茫中悄悄溜去见国王，说：“国王陛下，裁缝是个狂人，胆敢说他能找到古代遗失的金王冠。”

“这太好了。”国王说，叫裁缝第二天早晨去见他，命令他去把金王冠再找回来，否则就永远离开这个城市。“哦，”裁缝心里想，“这混蛋真会编。闷闷不乐的国王要我干谁也干不了的事，我何必等到明天，今天就出城去算了。”于是他捆好行李，出了城门，却为他不得不放弃幸福，离开这个他过得不错的城市而感到惆怅。他来到结识鸭子的那个池塘，那只老母鸭正在岸边用鸭嘴梳理羽毛，当初他把小鸭子还给了老母鸭，这时老母鸭一眼就认出他来，问他为什么这么垂头丧气。“要是你知道我碰到什么事，你就不会感到奇怪了。”裁缝回答说，向她讲自己的遭遇。“如果就是这件事，”老母鸭说，“我们可以想办法。金王冠掉到水里去了，现在就在水底，我们很快就把它捞上来，你在岸边铺开手绢等着好了。”老母鸭带着十二只小鸭潜入水中，五分钟以后，她又浮上来，用鸭翅架着金王冠，十二只小鸭游在她的周围，用他们的鸭嘴帮助托着金冠。鸭子游到岸边，把王冠放在手绢上。你简直想不到那王冠有多么美丽！太阳照射在王冠上，光芒闪耀，犹如数十万颗红榴石。裁缝把手绢的四角打上结，提去见国王，国王大喜，把一条金项链挂在裁缝脖子上。

鞋匠一计不成，又生一计。他去找国王说：“国王陛下，裁缝又口出狂言，说这整座王宫，连同里面所有的东西，能挪动的和不能挪动的，里里外外，他都能用蜡复制出来。”国王把裁缝叫去，命令他把整座王宫，连同里面的所有东西，能挪动的和不能挪动的，里里外外，都用蜡复制出来，如果他做不到，或者就只差墙上一根钉子，都要把他终生监禁在地牢里。裁缝心想：“越来越令人讨厌，谁能受得了？”行李包往背上一甩，走人。走到那棵空心树下，他坐下，低垂着头。蜜蜂飞出来，蜂王问他，他那么歪着脑袋，是不是脖子僵硬了。“啊，不是，”裁缝回答说，“是别的事情使我心情不舒畅。”便把国王要他办的事讲了一遍。蜜蜂们开始互相在一起嗡嗡叫了一阵，蜂王说：“你只管回家去吧，明天这个时候带一大块布来这里，一切就都解决了。”裁缝回去，蜜蜂飞去王宫，从敞开的窗户飞进宫里，爬到所有犄角旮旯里面把一切都看得一清二楚，然后飞回去，用蜂蜡[1]做出王宫的模型，速度之快，简直像眼看着它长起来一样。当天晚上，便已大功告成。第二天裁缝来了，整座华丽的宫殿立在那里，墙上一根钉子也不少，屋顶一片瓦也不缺，娇嫩洁白，气味香甜如同蜂蜜。裁缝小心翼翼地用布把它包起来，送去给国王；国王无比惊奇，把它摆在最大的厅堂，为此他送给裁缝一所石砌的大房子。

鞋匠仍不肯罢休，第三次去见国王，他说：“国王陛下，裁缝听说王宫里没有喷泉，他竟敢说庭院正中应该有一个一人高的喷泉，像水晶一样晶莹清亮。”国王把裁缝叫去，说：“如果明天在我宫中庭院里没有水柱喷涌出来，像你许诺的那样，刽子手就要在那个院子里使你矮下去一头。”可怜的小裁缝不假思索赶紧跑出城门，因为这一次会要他的命，泪水沿着他的脸颊往下滚滚流淌。他正十分伤心地走着，先前被他放了的那匹小马驹向他奔跑过来。小马驹已经长成一匹漂亮的棕色骏马。“现在是时候了，”骏马对他说，“我要报答你的恩惠。我知道你需要什么，马上就能对你有所帮助。只管骑上来吧，我的背载得了两个你这样的人。”裁缝又有了勇气，他跃上马背，马儿往城里迅跑，直奔王宫，绕王宫驰骋三圈，疾若闪电，三圈跑完，便霍然倒在地上。就在此时，随着一声骇人的巨响，王宫庭院正中的一块土地飞到空中，像一只圆球飞出宫外，紧跟着升起一股水柱，有骑在马上的人那么高，清澈明净有如水晶，阳光开始在喷泉上舞蹈。国王看了，惊奇得站起来，当着众人的面去拥抱小裁缝。

但是，好景不长。国王有许多女儿，可是没有儿子。恶毒的鞋匠第四次去见国王，对他说：“国王陛下，裁缝仍然非常狂妄自大，眼下他竟敢说，如果他愿意的话，可以从天上给国王陛下送一个儿子来。”国王把裁缝叫去说：“如果你在九天内让人给我送一个儿子来，我就把我的大女儿给你做妻子。”小裁缝心里想：“酬劳自然可观，好让人卖力干；可是樱桃树太高了，要是我爬上去摘樱桃，踩在脚下的树枝折断了，我就得摔下来。”回到家里，他盘腿坐在工作台上沉思对策。“不行，”末了，他大声说，“我要走，在这里日子过不安宁。”他捆好行李，匆匆出城。走到草地上，看见他的老朋友，鹳，像一位哲学家在那里来回踱步，时而停下脚步，仔细观察一只青蛙，末了把它一口吞下去。鹳走上前来向他问候，他说：“我看见你背着背囊，为什么你要离开这个城市？”裁缝向鹳诉说他无法满足国王对他的要求，并哀叹自己倒霉。“别为这事愁白了头发，”鹳说，“我要帮你摆脱困境。我老早就给城里送襁褓中的婴儿，我也可以从井里带个小王子出来。你回家去吧，放宽心不要烦恼。九天后你到王宫里去，那时我也要去。”小裁缝回家，他准时到王宫里去。不久，鹳飞来敲窗户，裁缝给他开窗，长腿老弟小心翼翼地进来，迈着庄严的步伐走过光滑的大理石地面。他嘴里叼着一个像天使般漂亮的孩子，那孩子朝向王后伸出一双小手。裁缝接过孩子，把他放在王后怀里，她抱着他亲吻他，高兴得不知怎么才好。鹳飞走前，从肩上拿下一个旅行袋递给王后。里面有好些纸袋，装着彩色甜豌豆，分给小公主们。大公主没得到一粒豌豆，却得到快乐的裁缝做她的丈夫。“我觉得就像是中了头彩，”裁缝说，“我母亲说得有理，她总说：谁信赖上帝，又有好运气，谁就不会失败。”

鞋匠不得不给裁缝做他举行婚礼时跳舞穿的鞋，随后他得到命令，要他离开京城，永远不许再回来。他沿着通往森林的路走去，走到绞架那儿。由于激怒、愤懑和天气炎热，他疲惫不堪地倒在地上，闭上眼睛，正想睡觉，吊死鬼头顶上的两只乌鸦高声叫着扑下来，啄掉了他的双眼。他莫名其妙地跑到森林里去，一定是饿死在里面了，因为后来再没有一个人看见过他，也没人听到过他的消息。

明亮的太阳会揭露这件事


一个裁缝伙计在各处漫游，靠自己的手艺为生。有一次他找不到活干，穷得一文不名，吃不上饭。这时他在路上碰见一个犹太人，他想，犹太人身上一定带着很多钱，便把上帝抛到九霄云外，径直朝那犹太人走过去，说：“拿钱出来，不然打死你。”那犹太人说：“饶了我吧，我没钱，我身上总共只有八分钱。”裁缝说：“你有钱，还不拿出来！”然后对犹太人拳脚交加，一顿痛打，直打得犹太人气息奄奄，眼看就要没命了。犹太人临死的时候，说了最后一句话：“明亮的太阳会揭露这件事的！”说完，他就死了。裁缝伙计翻他的口袋找钱，真像犹太人说的，他身上只有八分钱。他把那犹太人提起来，扛到一丛灌木后面，又继续漫游，干他的手艺活谋生去了。他旅行了很久，后来来到一座城市，在一个师傅那儿干活。师傅有个漂亮的女儿，他爱上了她，同她结了婚，他们的婚姻美好而幸福。

很久以后，他们已经有了两个孩子，岳父岳母双双去世，他们自己理家。一天早晨，丈夫坐在窗前桌子旁，妻子给他端来咖啡，他把咖啡倒在小碟上，正要喝的时候，太阳照在咖啡上，反光在墙上来回闪动，变幻成小圈圈。裁缝看着它说：“是啊，它很想揭露，可是不能够！”女人说：“唉，亲爱的丈夫，你说什么呀？你这话是什么意思？”他回答说：“我不能告诉你。”女人又说：“如果你还爱我，就得告诉我。”她说了许多好话劝他，说这事决不会让别人知道，她闹得他很不安宁。终于，他向她讲了：许多年以前，他在漫游途中如何穷困潦倒，一文不名，打死了一个犹太人，那个犹太人在临死的痛苦中说，明亮的太阳会揭露这件事的！现在太阳似乎很想揭露，在墙上闪动，变化出小圈圈，但是它做不到。之后，他又特意请求妻子千万不要告诉别人，否则他就没命了。他的妻子也答应了。可是，他一埋头干活，她就跑去找她的教母，悄悄告诉她这件事，又叮嘱她不要再告诉别人；不到三天时间，全城都知道了这件事情。裁缝上了法庭，被判处死刑。明亮的太阳毕竟还是揭露了这件事情。





蓝灯


从前有一个士兵，他为国王忠诚效劳了许多年，但当战争结束，这个士兵因为多处受伤，不能再在军中服务，国王就对他说：“你可以回家了，我不需要你了；你再拿不到什么钱了，因为只有能为我服务的人才能得到薪饷。”士兵不知道自己该靠什么维持生活，他满腹忧愁地离开，走了一整天，傍晚走进一座森林。暮色四合时，看见一点灯光，他朝灯光走去，来到一座房屋跟前，里面住着一个巫婆。“请你给我一个睡觉的地方，给我一点吃的喝的，”他对巫婆说，“我饿极了渴极了。”

“啊哈！”她回答说，“谁肯给一个散兵游勇东西啊？不过我要发善心，只要你能照我的要求去做，我就收留你。”

“你要我做什么？”士兵问。“明天你给我的园子翻地。”巫婆说。士兵答应了，第二天竭尽全力地干，天黑了还干不完。“我看，”巫婆说，“你今天是没法再干下去了，我愿意留你再住一夜，但是明天你得给我劈一车柴，劈得很细。”这活士兵干了一整天，晚上，巫婆建议他再住一夜：“明天你只需要替我办一件小事：我家后面有一口干涸的古井，我的灯掉井里去了，这盏灯发蓝光，不熄灭，你给我拿上来就行了。”第三天，老婆子带他到井边，叫他坐在一只大篮子里面下井去。士兵找到了蓝灯，发个信号，让她把他再拉上去。巫婆把他拉上来，快到井沿的时候，她伸手下去，要拿他手里的蓝灯。“不，”他说，看出她不怀好意，“我得双脚踩着地面，才能给你这盏灯。”巫婆一听，怒不可遏，又让他掉进井里，自己走了。

可怜的士兵摔在潮湿的井底，倒没受伤，蓝灯还一直亮着，但这对他有什么用？他明白自己难逃一死了。他很悲伤地坐了一会儿，无意中手伸进口袋，发现烟斗还在，烟锅里还装了半锅烟丝。他想，这是最后一点享受了，便拿出烟斗，就着蓝灯点上烟，抽起来。井里烟雾弥漫，这时，一个黑色小矮人站在他的面前，问道：“主人，你命令我做什么？”

“我能命令你干什么呢？”士兵答道，十分惊奇。

“你要我做什么事，”小矮人说，“我都必须办好。”

“好，”士兵说，“那你就先帮助我离开这口井。”小矮人拉着他的手，领他穿过地下通道，可是他并没忘记带上那盏蓝灯。一路上矮人指给他看巫婆收罗和储藏的财宝，士兵拿了尽可能多的黄金。到了地面上，他对小矮人说：“现在去把老巫婆绑了送上法庭。”不久，老巫婆骑在一只公猫背上，撕心裂胆地嚎叫着一阵风似地疾驰过去，又过不久，小矮人回来了，说：“事情都办完了，巫婆已经绞死了。”矮人又问：“主人，你还有什么命令？”

“现在不要你做什么，”士兵回答说，“你可以回家了，不过我一叫你，你得马上就到。”

“不用叫我，”小矮人说，“你只要在蓝色灯火上点着你的烟斗，我马上就出现在你的眼前。”说罢，他就在士兵眼前消失了。

士兵回到他原来那座城市，住进一家最好的旅馆，定做漂亮的衣服，然后吩咐旅馆老板替他布置一间房间，要尽可能的华丽。房间布置好了，士兵住进去，唤来小矮人，说：“我忠诚地为国王效劳，他却把我打发走，让我挨饿，现在我要报复。”

“要我干什么呢？”小矮人问。

“等到夜深人静，公主在床上睡着了，你把她背到我这里来，我要她给我当使女。”

小矮人说：“对我来说，这事容易，对你可是很危险的，一旦查出来，后果不堪设想。”

钟敲十二下的时候，士兵的门突然开了，小矮人背着公主进来。“啊哈，你来了？”士兵大声说，“快去干活！去拿扫帚打扫房间。”房间打扫完了，他把她叫到他坐的圈椅跟前，冲着她伸出双脚说：“给我脱靴子。”随后他把靴子朝公主脸上掷去，公主还得把靴子拾起来，擦干净，擦得锃亮。无论他叫她做什么，她都默默去做，并不抗拒，眼睛半睁半闭。鸡叫头遍的时候，小矮人又把她背回王宫，放在她的床上。

第二天早晨，公主起床后去见她的父亲，跟他说她做了一个怪梦：“一个人背着我像闪电般快地跑过几条街道，把我带到一个士兵的房间，我得给他当使女，伺候他，扫地、擦皮靴，什么下贱活都得干。这只是一个梦，可是我很累，像真干了那么多活那样累。”

“这梦也许是真的，”国王说，“我给你出个主意：把你的口袋铰一个小窟窿，口袋里装满豌豆，如果有人再把你带走，豌豆洒在路上，就留下线索了。”国王说这话的时候，小矮人正隐身在旁边，这些话他一句不漏都听见了。夜里，睡着的公主又被背着经过街道的时候，虽然豌豆从口袋里漏洒出来，但是不能提供什么线索，因为足智多谋的小矮人已经事先在所有街道上都洒了豌豆。公主又得干使女的活干到鸡叫。

第二天早晨国王派人四处寻找线索，但是无济于事，因为所有街道上穷人的孩子们都在捡豌豆，他们说：“昨夜天上掉下豌豆了。”国王说：“我们必须想个别的办法，你上床睡觉的时候不要脱鞋，再到那里，你把一只鞋藏在屋里；我有办法找到它。”小矮人听到了这个诡计。晚上，士兵又要他把公主弄来，他劝士兵打消这个念头，他说无法破这个诡计，一旦在他房间里找出那只鞋来，他就要遭殃了。“照我说的去做。”士兵回答说。第三天夜晚公主又得像使女一样干活，她被背回去之前，把一只鞋藏在了床下。

翌日早晨，国王在全城搜查他女儿的鞋；鞋在士兵房间里找到了。在此之前，士兵听从小矮人的请求，跑出城外，但他很快就被追上，抓进了监牢。逃跑时他忘了带上他最好的东西：蓝灯和黄金，口袋里只有一枚金币。他被铁链锁着，站在牢房窗边，看见他的一个伙伴走过。他敲窗玻璃，那人走过来，他对他说：“我在旅馆里落下一个小包，劳驾请你给我捎来，我给你一块金币。”那伙伴跑去，带来他所要的东西。士兵独自一人待着的时候，便在蓝灯上点着烟斗，叫黑色小矮人来。“不必惊慌，”小矮人对他的主人说，“他们押你去哪里，你就跟他们去哪里，不管发生什么事情，只要带着蓝灯，就没问题。”第二天对士兵进行审判，他虽然并没有干什么坏事，法官还是判处他死刑。他被押赴刑场的时候，请求国王给予他一个最后的恩典。“什么恩典？”国王问。

“准许我在路上抽一锅斗烟。”

“你可以抽三锅斗烟，”国王回答说，“但别以为我会饶你一命。”士兵于是抽出烟斗，就着蓝灯点燃了烟，几个烟圈升上来后，小矮人已经站在那里，手里拿着一根短棍，说：“主人命令我干什么？”

“把那些混账法官和他们的差役统统给我打倒在地，对那个待我刻薄的国王也别客气。”小矮人闪电一般地来回奔跑跳跃，谁一碰着他的棍子，谁就倒下，一动也不敢再动。国王害怕了，连声求饶，为了保住性命，他把王国交给士兵，并把女儿嫁给了他做妻子。





草驴


从前有一个猎人去森林里打猎。他满怀喜悦地一路走去，拿一片树叶在嘴上吹口哨，这时来了一个相貌丑陋的老太婆，和他搭话说：“你好，亲爱的猎人，你很快活，可是我又饿又渴，施舍给我点儿什么吧。”猎人可怜这老太婆，便伸手去口袋里拿出点东西给她。要走的时候，老太太拦住他说：“你听我说，亲爱的猎人，你心地善良，我要送你一件礼物：你一直走下去，过一会儿你就会看见一棵树，树上有九只鸟在互相争夺一件外衣。你用猎枪朝它们正中射击，那件外衣就会掉下来，同时也会有一只鸟被打死掉下来。你要把外衣拿了，这是一件如意衣；披在肩上，只要你想去哪里，眨眼间就到哪里。你把那只死鸟的心取出来，整个儿吞咽下去，每天早晨你一起床，都会看见在枕头下面有一块金子。”

猎人感谢女预言家，心里想：“她许诺给我的是美妙的东西，但愿能够实现。”走了百步左右，听见头顶上树枝间有鸟叫声，抬头一看，只见一群鸟用鸟嘴和脚爪在拉扯一件衬衣，鸣叫着，互相争夺，似乎哪只鸟都想把它据为己有。“咦，”猎人说，“奇怪，事情真是像老太太说的那样。”他从肩上取下猎枪，瞄准鸟群正中射去，毛羽纷飞。众鸟高声鸣叫着飞逃而去，一只鸟被射死，掉了下来，外衣也落在地上。猎人照老太婆吩咐的那样，剖开鸟，取出鸟心，一口吞了下去，带上外衣回家了。

第二天早晨，他睡醒的时候，忽然想起老太婆的预言，他想看看是否应验。一提起枕头，就看见一块金子在闪光，翌日又有一块，从此以后，每天起床时都是如此。他积攒了一堆金子，可是后来他想：“如果我老是在家里待着，这么多金子有什么用？我要出门去见识见识外面的世界。”

于是他告别父母，背上猎人的背包和猎枪，出门远游。有一天，他穿过一座茂密的森林，森林尽头的平原上，在他眼前出现一座壮观的宫殿。一个老妇人站在宫殿的一扇窗畔，旁边有一个绝色少女俯望窗外。这老妇人是个巫婆，她对她的女儿说：“从森林里出来一个人，这人身上有一件神奇的宝贝，我们得把它骗到手，我亲爱的心肝女儿，我们拥有它更合适。他肚子里有一颗鸟心，因此，他的枕头下面每天早晨都有一块金子。”她对那姑娘讲那鸟心是怎么回事，以及如何设骗局引他入壳，最后怒目威胁她说：“你若不听我的话，就叫你遭殃。”猎人走近了，看见那少女，他对自己说：“我游历了很长时间，现在我要到这富丽堂皇的宫殿里面休息一下，钱我有的是。”真正的原因是：他看中了那位千娇百媚的少女。

他走进屋里，受到亲切的迎接，有礼的款待。不久，他迷上了巫婆的女儿，只是看着她的眼睛，别的什么都不想，凡是她要求的，他都乐意做。老巫婆说：“现在我们必须得到那鸟心，他丢了它，自己也不会知道。”她调制一种饮料，烧好了，倒在一只酒杯里，叫姑娘端去给猎人喝。姑娘说：“亲爱的，为我的健康干了这杯。”他接过酒杯，喝了下去，很快就吐出了鸟心。姑娘偷偷把它捡起来，自己吞下去，因为老巫婆要她这么干。从此猎人在他的枕头下面再也找不到金子了，金子出现在姑娘的枕头下面，老巫婆每天都去那儿取。猎人痴心迷恋着姑娘，什么也不想，只想和姑娘一起消磨时光。

老巫婆又说：“鸟心我们有了，也得把他身上的如意衣拿来。”姑娘回答说：“让他留着那件如意衣吧，他已经失去财富了。”老婆子生气了，说：“这件外衣可是世上难得的神奇玩意儿，我非把它搞到手不可。”她把计谋告诉姑娘，并说如果不听她的话，就叫她大吃苦头。姑娘只好照老太婆的主意去做，靠在窗口，目望远方，仿佛十分悲伤。猎人问：“你这么伤心地站在这里，是为什么？”

“啊，我的心肝，”她回答说，“对面有一座宝石山，那里生长珍贵的宝石。我非常想要宝石，一想起来，就感到悲伤。可是，谁能去取宝石呢！只有飞鸟能飞到那里去，人是永远不能的。”

“如果你只是为此而忧伤，”猎人说，“我可以很快就解除你心中的烦恼。”说罢，他搂着她，让如意衣也盖着她的身子，发愿要去宝石山。眨眼的工夫，他们两人已经坐在宝石山上。四面八方都是宝石的闪光，看着这般景象着实赏心悦目，他们搜集起最美丽、最珍贵的宝石。由于老太婆施了巫术，猎人眼皮变得沉重起来。他对那姑娘说：“我累得站不住了，我们坐下休息一会儿吧。”他们坐下，他的头枕在她怀里睡着了。他一睡熟，她就脱下他披在肩上的如意衣，披在自己肩上，拿起宝石，发愿回家去了。

猎人一觉醒来，发现情人欺骗了他，把他独自一人留在了荒山野岭。“啊，”他说，“世上竟有这么无情无义的人！”他坐在那里，心中痛楚而忧虑，不知如何是好。这座山是属于野蛮残暴的巨人的，他们住在山上干他们的事。猎人在那里没待多久，就看见三个巨人大步流星走过来。他躺下装作睡得很死。巨人过来，一个踢他一脚说：“什么东西在这里！”第二个巨人说：“踩死他。”第三个不屑地说：“不值得费这力气！让他活好了，他在这儿待不住的，要是他再往高处爬，爬到山顶上，云就会抓住他，把他带走。”他们说着话走过去了，猎人却记住了他们说的话，等他们走远了，他就爬到了山顶上去。在那儿坐了一会儿，飘来一朵云，攫住他，带着他在天上飘了一段时间，然后徐徐降落在一片有围墙围着的大菜园里面，他轻轻地落在大白菜和别的蔬菜之间的地面上。

猎人环顾周围，说：“要是有点吃的就好了，我饿极了，很难再走下去。可是这里看不见苹果、梨和别的水果，到处都只有蔬菜。”最后他想，实在没办法，可以吃莴苣，莴苣虽然味道不是特别好，但可以充饥提神。于是他挑了一棵漂亮的吃起来，刚吞下几口，就有一种很奇异的感觉，觉得自己完全变了，长出四条腿，一个大脑袋，两只长耳朵，他惊恐地发现自己变成了一只驴子。因为他还是感到饿得厉害，多汁的莴苣正合他的口味，他便贪婪地吃个不停。终于他吃到另一种莴苣，才吞咽下一点，就再度觉得自己的身体起了变化：他恢复了原先的人形。

于是猎人躺下睡觉，消除疲劳。第二天早晨醒来，他摘了一棵坏莴苣，一棵好莴苣，心里想：“这东西会帮助我收回我的宝物，惩罚无情无义之人。”他把莴苣带在身上，爬过围墙，去找他的情人的宫殿。走了几天，他很幸运地找到了。于是他迅速把自己的面孔弄成褐色，他的母亲即使见了他，也未必能认出他来。他走进宫殿里面请求借住一夜。“我非常疲惫，”他说，“实在走不动了。”巫婆问他：“你是谁，你是干什么的？”他回答说：“我是国王的使节，国王派我去寻找太阳底下生长的最可口的莴苣。我非常幸运，找到它了，把它采摘了带在身上，可是骄阳似火，我担心娇嫩的莴苣会枯萎了，真不知道还能不能带回去。”

老太婆听说有可口的莴苣，馋涎欲滴，她说：“亲爱的老乡，让我尝一尝珍奇的莴苣吧。”

“当然可以！”他回答说，“我带了两棵，可以给你们一棵。”他打开背包，把那棵坏莴苣递给她。巫婆毫无戒心，馋得直流口水，就自己跑去做菜。做好了，等不及摆上餐桌，先拿了几片塞进嘴里；一咽下去，马上失去了人形，变成一头母驴，跑到院子里去。使女来到厨房，看见做好的莴苣，要把它端上餐桌，半路上照例忍不住要先尝个鲜，吃了几片，立刻就见神效，也变成一头母驴跑到院子里找老巫婆做伴去了，盛莴苣的碗掉在地上。在此期间，猎人陪伴美丽的姑娘坐着，老是没人端莴苣来，她又很想尝尝，便说：“不知道莴苣在哪儿了。”猎人心里想：看来是那菜起作用了，就说：“我去厨房问问。”他走下去，看见两头母驴在院子里乱跑，莴苣掉在地上。“不错，”他说，“这两个罪有应得。”他把剩下的菜捡起来放在碗里，给那姑娘送去。“为了不让你久等，”他说，“我亲自把这美味食物给你端来了。”她吃了，也像那两个一样马上失去了人形，变成一头母驴跑到院子里去。

猎人洗完脸，变成母驴的那几个人都能认出他是谁了，他走到院子里，说：“你们无情无义，现在该受报应了。”他把她们三个拴在一条绳上，赶到一座磨坊去。他敲窗户，磨坊主探出头来，问他有什么事。“我有三只很凶的畜生，”他回答说，“我不想再留着它们了。你如果想要它们，我可以付给你钱，你要多少就给你多少，只要你照我要求的那样喂它们草料，对待它们就行。”磨坊主说：“为什么不呢？你要我怎样对待它们？”猎人说，那头老母驴，也就是老巫婆，一天得打它三次，给它吃一次草料；那头小母驴，就是那个使女，一天打一次，给它吃三次草料；那最小的母驴，就是那个姑娘，一天给它吃三次草料，不要打它，因为他毕竟不忍心让这姑娘挨打。之后，他就回到宫殿，他需要的一切那里都有。

过了几天，磨坊主来告诉他说，一天光挨打只吃一次草料的老母驴死了。“其余两头母驴，”他继续说，“虽然没死，一天吃三次草料，但它们都很伤心，恐怕也活不长久了。”猎人起了怜悯之心，怒气消了，对磨坊主说，要他还把驴子赶来。两头驴子来了，他拿好莴苣给它们吃，让它们重新恢复人形。那美丽的姑娘在他的面前跪下说：“啊，我最亲爱的人，请你原谅我对你做的坏事，这些都是我母亲逼我做的，是违背我的本心的，因为我真心爱你。你的如意衣挂在一个柜橱里，我喝一帖吐药，就把鸟心吐出来还给你。”这时猎人的想法变了，他说：“你留着吧，反正都一样，因为我要娶你做我的忠实的夫人。”他们举行了婚礼，在一起过着愉快的生活。





三兄弟


从前，有个男人有三个儿子，他的全部财产就是他住的那所房子，三个儿子都想在他死后得到这所房子。父亲对这三个儿子都很疼爱，他不知道该如何做才能不偏不倚。他不肯卖掉房子，因为它是祖上传下来的，否则，卖房子的钱就可以给他们平分了。最后他想出一个办法，便对儿子们说：“你们都去外面走走，试试运气，各人学一门手艺，回来以后，谁最有本事，房子就给谁。”三个儿子都同意了。老大要当给马蹄钉铁掌的工匠，老二想当理发师，老三却想当个击剑师。他们定了一个回家重聚的日子，就出门去了。说也凑巧，他们各自都找到高明的师傅，学到了真本事。铁匠给国王的马钉马掌，他想：“毫无疑问，我准能得到那所房子。”理发师净给体面的老爷先生们刮胡子，他也想：“这房子准定归我无疑了。”剑士一身伤痕累累，但他咬紧牙关，并不懊恼，因为他心里想：“若怕受剑伤，永远得不到房子。”

到了预定的日期，三兄弟又在父亲那儿团聚。他们不知道怎样才能得到显示技艺的最好机会，便坐在一起商议。正在这时，忽然一只兔子越过田野向这边跑来。“好，”理发师说，“它来得正是时候。”他拿起脸盆、肥皂，打好肥皂沫，等兔子一到跟前，在它迅跑如飞之时，给它抹皂液，修剪出一副短胡子，还没划破一点皮。“我很满意，”父亲说，“其他人如果没有更出色的本领，房子就归你了。”没过多久，一个老爷坐着马车疾驰而来。蹄铁匠说：“爸爸，现在请你看看我的手艺。”他向马车跃去，取下疾奔中的马的四个马蹄铁，钉上四个新的，那马一直不停地奔跑。“你是个了不起的人，”父亲说，“你的手艺和你弟弟的一样好，我不知道该把房子给谁了。”老三说：“爸爸，让我也试一试吧。”这时正好下起雨来，他抽出剑飞快舞起来，护住头顶，没有一滴雨点落在他的身上；雨越下越大，后来成了瓢泼大雨，他的剑也越舞越快，身上始终没有被雨水打湿，竟像是坐在屋里一样。父亲见了，惊讶地说：“你的本事最了不起，房子是你的了。”

两个哥哥都遵守原先的约定，对父亲的决定表示赞同。三兄弟相亲相爱，仍旧一起住在这房子里，做他们的手艺活。他们技艺高超，人又机灵，因此挣了很多钱。就这样，三兄弟一起过着愉快的生活，直到晚年。后来病死了一个，另外两个悲伤得生了病，不久也都去世了。因为他们机灵聪明，彼此十分友爱，三兄弟被合葬在一座坟墓里。





跳舞跳破了的鞋


从前有一个国王，他有十二个女儿，长得一个比一个漂亮。她们一起睡在一个大厅里，一张张卧床并排摆着。晚上，她们上床后，国王亲自来锁门，还上了门闩。可是第二天早晨他开门时，总是发现女儿们的鞋跳舞跳破了，谁也不知道这是怎么回事。于是国王发出通告：谁能三天三夜时间探查出她们夜间在哪里跳舞，就可以从她们中间挑选一个作妻子，并可在他去世后继承王位；但若报名后三天三夜查不出来，他也就活不成了。不久便有一位王子前来冒险一试。他受到殷勤接待，晚上被人领到紧挨着大卧室的一间房间里去。他的床铺就在那房间里面，他得留神她们去哪里跳舞；为了不让她们背地里耍什么花招，或跑到别处去，大卧室的门敞开着。

可是王子觉得眼皮铅一样的沉重，他睡着了，第二天早晨他睡醒的时候，十二个公主都已经跳过舞了，她们的鞋底子都跳舞跳破了。第二夜、第三夜也是如此，那个王子被毫不留情地砍掉了脑袋。后来又有许多人报名来干这种冒险的事，他们一个个全都丢了性命。碰巧有个穷当兵的受了伤，不能在军中服役，在前往国王所在的城市途中遇见一个老妇人，她问他要去哪儿。“我自己也不知道，”他说，又开玩笑接着说，“我倒很想去探查探查那些公主在哪里跳舞跳得鞋都跳破了，将来好当国王。”

“这并不难办，”老妇人说，“你不能喝晚上给你端去的酒，要装出熟睡的样子。”接着，她又给他一件外衣，说：“披上它，谁也看不见你，你就可以悄悄尾随那十二个人了。”那当兵的得到这个好主意，竟认真起来，下决心以求婚者的身份应征去见国王。他像别人一样受到很好的接待，穿上了王室的服装。晚上快就寝的时候，有人带他进入卧室，他正要上床，大公主给他送来了一杯酒，他事先在下巴底下系了一块海绵，一滴酒也没喝，全都倒在海绵上。他躺下，过一会儿，发出像睡熟的人那样的鼾声。十二个公主听见，都笑了，大公主说：“这个人分明是来送死啊。”随后她们都起来打开衣箱、柜橱，取出华丽的衣裳，照着镜子打扮，跳来跳去，为就要去参加舞会感到十分高兴。只有年纪最小的公主说：“不知道是什么缘故，你们都这么高兴，可我有一种异样的感觉，觉得会有祸事。”

“你是个小傻瓜，”大公主说，“总是前怕狼后怕虎。你忘了有多少王子在这儿待过，都不管用？这个大兵我不给他安睡药酒喝，他也会睡得像死人一样。”她们全都打扮整齐了，才去看一眼那个当兵的。他双目紧闭，一动不动，她们认为不会有问题了。于是大公主走过去敲几下她的卧床，那张床就陷入地下去，她们由大公主领头鱼贯从那入口进去。那个当兵的把这一切都看在眼里，他不再犹豫，披上他那件外衣紧跟在小公主后面也下去了。还没下完梯级，他不小心踩着了小公主的裙子，小公主吓了一跳，大叫：“谁？谁拽我的裙子？”

“别冒傻气了，”大公主说，“你是给钩子挂了一下。”她们全都走完了梯级，到了地底下，走在一条奇妙的林荫道上，那里的树叶都是银的，闪烁放亮。当兵的想：“得拿点东西作凭证。”便折了一枝树枝，树上咔嚓一声响，小公主又喊：“不对头，你们听见响声了吗？”大公主说：“那是在鸣枪庆贺，因为我们很快就能把王子们解救出来了。”接着她们来到另一条林荫道上，那里的树叶都是金的。最后走到第三条林荫道上，那里的树叶都是晶莹的钻石，当兵的从后面两条林荫道上各折了一枝树枝，每次咔嚓一声响，都吓得小公主发抖，但大公主都说这是欢庆的枪声。她们一直走到一条大河畔，河边有十二条小船，每一条小船里有一位英俊的王子在等候着她们。他们每人接一位公主到自己的船上，当兵的和小公主登上同一条船。船上那个王子说：“不知道为什么今天这船沉得多，我得用尽全身力气划船才能前进。”

“怎么会这样呢，”小公主说，“大概是天热的缘故吧，我也觉得心里烦躁。”河对岸有一座美丽的宫殿，灯火辉煌，宫中响起鼓点和喇叭的欢快的音乐声。他们划船过河，走进宫殿，每位王子和自己的心上人共舞；那当兵的也一块儿跳舞，但没人看得见他。哪个公主手里拿着一只盛着葡萄酒的酒杯，他就把这杯酒喝了，公主把酒杯端到唇边时，那已是一只空酒杯。小公主感到惊恐，但大公主不让她声张。她们一直跳舞跳到凌晨三点，鞋底都跳破了，只好停下。众王子划船送她们过河，这一次那当兵的在前面坐上大公主那条船。公主们在河岸边和王子们告别，答应夜里还要再去。她们踏上阶梯的时候，那个当兵的跑在前面，躺倒在床上，十二个公主疲惫地慢悠悠爬上来时，他又大声打鼾，公主们听了说：“这个人坏不了我们的事。”于是她们脱下美丽的衣裳，放到一边，把跳舞跳破了的鞋放在床下，然后躺下睡觉。第二天早晨当兵的什么也不说，他准备再跟着去看看这种稀罕事，第二夜第三夜他都随公主们前往。一切都同第一夜一样，每次她们都要跳舞跳到鞋破方休。第三次那当兵的拿了一只酒杯作为凭证。到了该他去回复国王的时候，他把三根树枝、一只酒杯藏在身上，去见国王，十二个公主站在门后听他说些什么。国王问：“我的十二个女儿夜间在哪里跳舞跳破了鞋？”他回答说：“和十二个王子一起在一座地下宫殿里跳舞。”他接着报告事情经过，并拿出物证。国王叫公主们出来，问她们当兵的所说的是不是事实，她们见事情已经暴露，抵赖毫无用处，只好全部承认。随后国王问他想要哪个公主做妻子，他回答说：“我年纪不小了，把大公主许配给我吧。”于是当天举行婚礼，国王允诺自己去世后由他继承王位。但是被施了魔法的王子们还不能得到解救，得过了同公主们跳舞一样多的夜晚的天数才行。





黑白新娘


一个女人带自己的亲生女儿和继女去野外割喂牲畜的草料。上帝变成一个穷人向她们走来，问她们：“要去村里该怎么走？”

“你要想知道，”母亲说，“就自己找去。”女儿补上一句：“怕找不着路，就雇个指路人。”继女说：“我领你去，跟我来吧。”亲爱的上帝对那母女俩很生气，转过身去，背对着她们，诅咒她们，让她们像黑夜一样乌黑，像罪恶一样丑陋。但上帝对继女很仁慈，和她一道走，快进村的时候，上帝为她祝福，并且说：“我要满足你三个愿望，你挑三个说吧。”于是姑娘说：“我愿能像太阳一样美丽纯洁。”很快她就变得如同白昼一样耀眼美丽。“我希望有一个永远不会空的钱袋。”亲爱的上帝也给了她，但他又说：“不要忘了最好的东西。”她接着说：“第三件，我希望我死后能上永恒的天国。”上帝也答应了她，最后亲爱的上帝和她告别了。

继母和她的女儿回到家里，发现她们两人变得像煤炭一样乌黑，又丑陋不堪，继女却又白皙又漂亮，对继女更加怀恨在心，一心想要加害于她。那继女有一个哥哥，名叫雷吉纳尔，她很爱她的哥哥，把发生的一切全都告诉了他。有一次雷吉纳尔对她说：“亲爱的妹妹，我要给你画一张像，这样我就总能看见你，因为我非常爱你，每时每刻都想见到你。”她回答说：“不过我请你别让人看见这张画像。”于是他画了一张妹妹的肖像，挂在他的房间里面。他是国王的马车夫，所以他住在王宫里。他天天站在妹妹肖像跟前，感谢上帝赐予他亲爱的妹妹幸福。这时恰巧他所效劳的国王的王后去世了，王后生前美貌非凡，简直找不到能和她相比的女子，国王对王后的去世深感悲痛。

宫中侍从发觉国王的车夫天天站在那幅美丽的肖像前面，他们妒忌他，便向国王报告。国王下令把画像给他拿去，他一看这画中人酷似他那已故的王后，只是比王后还要美丽，便热恋上了她。他把车夫传来，问他这画中人是谁。车夫说是他的妹妹，国王便决定娶她做妻子，给车夫马车、马匹和华丽的金衣裳，派他去把自己选中的未婚妻接来。雷吉纳尔带着使命到达的时候，他的妹妹很高兴，黑姑娘嫉妒她的幸福，非常生气，对她母亲说：“你的那些能耐都哪里去了？也不能给我带来这样的幸福。”

“别嚷嚷，”老婆子说，“我就给你想办法。”她施展巫术，使车夫变成半瞎，看东西一片模糊，再把白姑娘的耳朵堵上，使她成了半聋。随后他们登上马车，身穿王室华丽服装的新娘子先上车，接着是继母和她的女儿，雷吉纳尔坐在车夫座上驾车。走了一程，车夫大声说：“我的小妹子，遮蔽好身子，别让雨水打湿了你，别让风吹尘土弄脏了你，要漂漂亮亮到国王那里去！”

新娘子问：“我亲爱的哥哥说什么？”

“啊，”老婆子说，“他叫你把金衣裳脱下来给你妹妹穿。”她就脱下来给那黑姑娘，黑姑娘把自己一件破旧的灰褂子给她。马车载着她们继续朝前走，过一会儿，哥哥又大声说：“我的小妹子，遮蔽好身子，别让雨水打湿了你，别让风吹尘土弄脏了你，要漂漂亮亮到国王那里去！”

新娘子问：“我亲爱的哥哥说什么？”

“啊，”老婆子说，“他叫你把金帽子摘下来给你妹妹戴。”她把金帽拿下来给黑姑娘戴上，自己没帽子戴了。他们继续朝前走了一会儿，哥哥又大声说：“我的小妹子，遮蔽好身子，别让雨水打湿了你，别让风吹尘土弄脏了你，要漂漂亮亮到国王那里去！”

新娘子问：“我亲爱的哥哥说什么？”

“啊，”老婆子说，“他叫你往车外面看一看。”这时候马车正在过一座桥，桥下是一条很深的河。新娘子站起来，半个身子探出车外，那两人使劲一推，她掉进河里去了。就在她沉没在河里的那一瞬间，从水面上浮起一只雪白雪白的鸭子，顺流游下去。哥哥根本毫无察觉，驾车将她们送进宫里，把黑姑娘当作他的妹妹交给国王，还以为那个人真是他的妹妹，因为他眼前一片模糊，只看见金衣裳闪闪发光。国王一见自己想望中的新娘子奇丑无比，非常生气，下令把车夫扔进一个养着毒蛇的土坑里。老巫婆有一套诱惑国王的办法，她施巫术使国王眼睛昏花，使得他把她们留在宫里，甚至让他觉得她女儿还不错，真的和她结了婚。

一天晚上，就在黑新娘坐在国王怀里的时候，一只白鸭从下水道游到御膳坊，对小厨师说：“请烧把火，小兄弟，好让我烘干毛羽。”

小厨师照办，给它在炉灶上生了火，鸭子蹲在炉灶旁摇晃着身子，梳理羽毛。它这么舒适地蹲着，问道：“我哥哥雷吉纳尔在干什么？”

小厨师回答说：“他被关在土坑里，和毒蛇在一起。”

鸭子又问：“黑姑娘在家里干什么？”

小厨师回答说：“她暖暖和和地坐在国王怀里。”

鸭子说：“上帝啊，可怜可怜吧！”又从下水道游出去了。

第二天晚上鸭子又来了，还是问同样的问题，第三天晚上又来一次。小厨师实在不忍心，便去见国王，向他报告一切。国王要亲自查明情况，就在第二天晚上前来御膳坊，鸭子从下水道口探出头来，他就拔剑斩断鸭脖子，鸭子一下子变成美丽非凡的姑娘，和她的哥哥画的像一模一样。国王高兴极了；她全身湿漉漉地站在那里，国王叫人送来华贵的衣裳，让她更衣。之后，她向国王讲述她如何中了奸计，最后被推到河里，她首先请求把她的哥哥从蛇洞里放出来。国王满足了这个请求之后，走近老巫婆待着的房间，问她，做了如此这般事情的人该当如何处置，并讲了发生的事情。老巫婆的脑子乱了，毫无察觉，她说：“应该脱光这个女人的衣服，把她放在一个钉着钉子的大木桶里，让马拉着那木桶到处跑。”后来就完全按照这个办法处置了老巫婆和她的黑女儿。国王和洁白美丽的新娘子结了婚，并奖赏了她忠诚的哥哥，使他成为一个富有又受人尊敬的人。





希梅里山


从前有两个兄弟，一个富有，一个贫穷。富人什么也不给穷人，穷人只好靠做谷物买卖勉强维持生活；有时他的日子很艰难，甚至不能让老婆、儿子吃上面包。一天，他推着手推车穿过森林的时候，看见一座寸草不生的大山，因为他从来没看见过这座大山，就停下来惊奇地看着它。他站在那里，只见十二个身高马大的粗野的男人走了过来，他以为这是一伙强盗，就赶紧把他的车子推到树丛里去，自己爬上一棵树，等着看要发生什么事情。那十二个大汉走到山前，大声喊道：“塞姆希山，塞姆希山，开门！”秃山很快从中间分开，十二个大汉走了进去，他们一到里面，山又合上了。过一会儿，山开了，大汉们出来，背上都驮着沉重的口袋。他们走到阳光下，说：“塞姆希山，塞姆希山，关门。”山迅速合拢，再也看不出这座山的入口，那十二个人走了。等到他们完全从穷人的视线中消失，穷人才从树上爬下来，他很想知道山腹里面究竟隐藏着什么神秘的东西。于是他走上前去，说：“塞姆希山，塞姆希山，开门！”果然山门大开。他走进去，原来整座山就是一个装满金银的洞穴，里面还有好多堆珍珠和闪光的宝石，像谷物那样堆放着。那穷人完全不知道该怎么办，不知道自己是不是可以拿点珠宝回去。后来他把口袋装满了金子，珍珠和宝石原封不动放着。他从山里出来后，依样画葫芦，说：“塞姆希山，塞姆希山，关门！”山合上了，他便推着手推车回家。现在他不用发愁了，他可以用金子给妻子和孩子买面包，还能买葡萄酒，生活得很愉快。他为人正直，并乐善好施，经常帮助穷人。钱用完了，他去跟他哥哥借一只木桶，又去拿一次金子，但那几堆珠宝他从不碰一下。他第三次想去拿点金子，又向他哥哥借木桶。那富人早就嫉妒他的财产，嫉妒他家过的好日子，不明白他兄弟的财富哪儿来的，要借木桶干什么。于是想出一个计策，在桶底涂上沥青，归还木桶时，发现里面粘着一块金币。富人马上去找他弟弟，问：“你用木桶量什么？”

“谷物和大麦。”弟弟说。哥哥给他看那枚金币，威胁他说，如果不对他讲真话，他就去法院告他。于是他把事情经过向富人全盘托出。富人马上叫人套一辆马车赶去，想好好利用这个机会，把所有宝贝统统运回来。他到了山前，大声喊道：“塞姆希山，塞姆希山，开门！”山分开了，他走进去。所有金银珠宝统统在他眼前，很长时间他不知道该先拿什么才好，最后他尽可能多地装宝石，装到他快背不动为止。他要把它们运出来，但因他全部心思念念不忘珠宝，竟忘了山名，他大声喊叫：“希梅里山，希梅里山，开门。”可是这山不叫这名字，山纹丝不动，依然锁闭着。他害怕了，越想脑子越乱，所有那些金银珠宝都帮不了他一点忙。晚上，山门开了，十二个强盗进来，看见他在里面，强盗们哈哈大笑，大声说：“好小子，我们终于逮着你了，你来过两次，你以为我们不知道？我们没抓你就是了，第三回你可跑不了了。”他大叫：“以前来的不是我，是我弟弟！”不管他说什么，不管他怎么恳求饶命，强盗还是砍下了他的脑袋。





小驴子


从前有一个国王和一个王后，他们很富有，事事称心如意，唯一的缺憾就是没有孩子。王后为此日夜哀叹，她说：“我就像一块什么都不长的庄稼地。”上帝终于满足了她的愿望，但孩子出生的时候，看着不像个小孩，倒像一头小驴子。母亲看见了，号啕痛哭，说她宁愿压根儿就没有孩子，也不要一头驴子，说要把它扔进河里喂鱼。但是国王说：“不，既然上帝把他给了我们，他就是我的儿子，我死后就由他戴王冠、继承王位。”于是驴子被养起来，渐渐长大，耳朵也长得高高的，笔直地竖起来。这驴子生性快活，到处跳来跳去，尤其喜爱音乐。他去找一个著名的乐师，对他说：“把你的技术教给我，让我弹奏琉特[1]能像你弹奏的那么动听。”

“啊，亲爱的少爷，”乐师回答说，“你会觉得很困难的，你的手指太大，并不特别适合弹奏，我担心琴弦会断。”可是无论他怎么推托都无济于事，小驴子就是要学弹奏琉特。他学琴有恒心，又勤奋，最后竟弹得像他的老师一样出色。有一天，这位年轻少爷一边散步一边沉思，走到一口水井旁边，他往井里一看，明亮如镜的水面上映出他那驴子的身影，他伤心极了，决心到广阔的世界去，随身只带一个忠实的伙伴。他们四处漫游，最后来到一个王国，统治这个王国的老国王有一个美貌非凡的独生女儿。小驴子说：“我们就在这里停留一下吧。”他敲城门，大声叫道：“有一个客人来访问，请开门让他进城。”城门不开，他就坐下，取出琉特，用他的两只前蹄弹奏起来，弹奏得非常美妙动听。守城的士兵瞪大了眼睛，跑去向国王报告说：“有一只小驴子在城门外弹奏琉特，他弹奏得很好，和熟练的乐师没什么两样。”

“那就把这个乐师给我叫进来吧。”国王说。小驴子一进去，所有的人都笑这个琉特演奏家。他被安排和仆人坐在一起吃饭，小驴子不乐意，他说：“我不是一头驴圈里普普通通的驴子，我是一头高贵的驴。”他们说：“既然如此，你去和武士们坐在一起吧。”

“不，”他说，“我要坐在国王身边。”国王笑了，兴致很好地说：“好，就准了你的要求，小驴子，到我身边来吧。”驴子在他身边坐下后，他又问：“小驴子呀，喜欢我的女儿吗？”小驴子转过脑袋，凝视着公主，点点头说：“太喜欢了，我还从来没见过这么漂亮的人儿呢。”

“那么你也应该坐在她的身边。”国王说。“我正求之不得。”驴子说，便坐在她身边吃喝起来，举止倒还挺文明得体。这只高贵的小动物在国王宫廷里待了一段时间以后，心里想：“这一切有什么用呢，到头来还不是得回家？”他悲伤地低垂着脑袋，走到国王跟前，就要告辞。国王却很喜欢他，说：“小驴子，你怎么啦？你看上去很悲伤，留在我这儿吧，你要什么，我给你。你要金子吗？”

“不。”小驴子说，摇摇脑袋。

“你要珠宝和装饰品？”

“不。”

“你要我的半个王国？”

“哦，不。”

“我要是知道怎么能让你快乐就好了，”国王说，“你要我的美丽的女儿做妻子？”

“对，对，”小驴子说，“我就是想要她。”一下子变得快活起来，因为这正是他心里所希望的。国王满足了他的要求，为他们举办了盛大豪华的婚礼。晚上，新郎新娘被领进洞房，国王想知道小驴子是不是也懂得温柔、有礼，便派一个侍从藏在那里。洞房里只有他们两人了，新郎插上门闩，扫视一下周围，相信只有他们两人在场，一下子脱下驴皮，一个英俊的王族子弟赫然站在那里。“你看我是谁？”他说，“你说我配不上你吗？”新娘子高兴极了，吻他，从心坎里爱他。天刚破晓，他跳起来，又套上那一身驴皮，谁也想不到驴皮里面是个何等样的人物。国王很快也来了，说：“嗨，小驴子又欢蹦乱跳了！”他对他的女儿说，“你没能嫁给一个人，一定很伤心吧？”

“哦，不，亲爱的父亲，我非常爱他，我觉得他是世界上最漂亮的男人，我要和他过一辈子。”国王觉得不可思议，这时，藏在洞房里的那个侍从来了，详尽地向国王报告了情况。国王说：“这绝不可能是真的。”

“那么明天晚上您亲自去守夜，您就会亲眼看见，国王陛下，您只要拿掉他的皮，把它扔进火里，他就会现出原形。”

“你的计策很好。”国王说。晚上，他们睡着以后，他悄悄溜进去，走到床前，月光下看见一个高贵的年轻人躺在床上，脱下的驴皮扔在地上。他把驴皮拿走，命人在外面生起一堆大火，把驴皮扔进火里，亲自守在旁边，看它烧成灰烬。他想看看新郎丢了驴皮怎么办，便彻夜不眠，细听有什么动静。年轻人睡醒了，晨光初露，他起床，正要套上驴皮，可是哪儿也找不到它了。他吃惊不小，又伤心又害怕地说：“看来我只好逃走了。”他走出来，国王站在门口，说：“我的儿子，你匆匆忙忙要去哪里？你有什么心事？留在这里吧，你是一个漂亮的男子，不要离开我，我要把我的半个王国给你，我死后整个王国都给你。”

“我希望良好的开端也能有良好的结局，”年轻人说，“我留在您这里。”于是老人给他半个王国，一年后国王去世，他拥有了整个王国。他的父亲去世后他又得到一个王国，享尽荣华富贵。

小牧童


从前有一个小牧童，无论问他什么问题，他都能聪明地回答，因而远近闻名。国王对此亦有所耳闻，但他不信，就派人把小牧童叫来。国王对他说：“我向你提三个问题，如果你能回答，我就把你看成自己的亲生儿子，叫你和我一起住在我的王宫里。”小牧童问：“是哪三个问题？”国王说：“第一个问题是：海洋里有多少滴水？”小牧童回答说：“国王陛下，请您把大地上所有江河统统堵塞起来，在我数完之前，不让一滴水流入海洋，那样，我就能告诉您大洋里有多少滴水。”国王说：“另一个问题是：天上有多少星星？”小牧童说：“请您给我一大张白纸。”然后他在纸上用笔点了好多极细小的小点儿，密密麻麻，看都看不清楚，更没法去数，谁要是往纸上看一会儿，眼睛都会昏花。牧童接着说：“这张纸上有多少个点儿，天上就有多少颗星星，你们数一数好了。”可是，有谁能数得清楚呢？国王说：“第三个问题是：永恒有多少秒？”小牧童回答说：“后波美拉尼亚有一座金刚石山，到山顶要一小时路程，往里也要走一小时。每隔一百年有一只小鸟飞去那儿，在金刚石上磨鸟嘴，到了整座山被鸟嘴磨平的时候，永恒的第一秒钟才算过去。”

国王说：“你像一个智者那样回答了这三个问题，从今以后，你就和我一起住在我的王宫里，我要像对待亲生儿子那样待你。”





星星银圆


从前有一个小姑娘，父母都已去世，她穷得没有房子住，没有床可睡觉，除了穿在身上的衣服和手里拿着的一个有同情心的人送给她的一小块面包，什么都没有。但这小姑娘又善良又虔诚。她孤苦伶仃，无依无靠，怀着对亲爱的上帝的信赖，走到野外。她在那里遇见一个穷人，那穷人说：“啊，给我点儿吃的吧，我饿极了。”小姑娘把那仅有的一小块面包整个儿都递给他，说：“愿上帝保佑你！”说完，继续往前走。这时一个小孩子边走边哭着说：“我的头冷极了，送我点东西吧，让我盖着脑袋。”小姑娘脱下帽子给他。又走了一会儿，又来了一个孩子，没穿背心，冷得发抖，小姑娘把自己的背心给他。她继续往前走，一个孩子向她讨一件外衣，她就脱下自己身上的给他。最后，小姑娘走进一座森林里面，天已经黑了，又有个孩子来跟她讨一件衬衣，虔诚的小姑娘心里想：现在已经是黑夜，没有人看见，可以把衬衣给他，于是脱下衬衣送给那个孩子。她站在那儿，身上什么东西也没有了，忽然，星星从天上掉下来，掉下来的都是坚硬、锃亮的银圆。虽然她的衬衣刚刚脱下送人了，现在身上却穿着一件新的衬衣，还是最精致的亚麻做的呢！她把银圆都兜在衬衣里，终生都很富有。





雪白和玫瑰红


有一个贫穷的寡妇孤单地住在一间小草屋里，房前有个花园，花园里有两株小玫瑰树，一株开白花，一株开红花。寡妇有两个孩子，像那两株玫瑰树一样，一个叫雪白，另一个叫玫瑰红。她们两个又虔诚又善良，热爱劳动，勤勉不息，真是世上少有；只是雪白比玫瑰红还更娴静、更温柔。玫瑰红更喜欢在草地上、田野上蹦蹦跳跳，寻找花朵，捕捉夏天的鸟儿；雪白则留在家里陪伴母亲，帮她料理家务，没什么事做的时候，就读书给她听。两个孩子相亲相爱，一起出去，总是手挽着手。如果雪白说：“我们不分开。”玫瑰红就回答说：“只要活着，我们就不分开。”母亲补上一句：“一个人有什么必须要和另一个人分。”她们常常在森林里跑来跑去，收集草莓；动物不伤害她们，倒和她们很亲近：小兔子从她们手上吃白菜叶，狍子在她们身边吃草，小鹿欢快地跳跃，小鸟儿停在枝头唱它们会唱的歌。她们没有发生过意外事故：如果她们在森林里长久逗留，夜幕降临，她们便并肩躺在苔藓上睡到第二天早晨，母亲知道了，并不为她们担忧。一次，她们在森林过夜，当朝霞唤醒她们的时候，她们看见一个俊美的孩子，穿一身洁白、闪亮的衣裳，坐在她们睡处的旁边。那孩子站起来，友爱地望着她们，一句话也没说，就走进了森林里。她们环顾周遭，发现自己睡在深渊的边缘，如果在黑暗中再走几步，就一定会掉下去。母亲告诉她们，那一定是守护好孩子的天使。

雪白和玫瑰红把母亲的小草屋收拾得非常整洁，让人朝屋里一望，就感到赏心悦目。夏天，玫瑰红料理家务，每天早晨母亲睡醒之前，她就把一束花放在母亲床前，每株小玫瑰树都有一朵玫瑰花在里面。冬天，雪白生火，把锅吊在火钩上，那口锅是青铜做的，被擦得非常干净，像黄金似地亮光闪闪。晚上雪花飞舞的时候，母亲说：“雪白，去把门闩闩上！”然后她们在炉灶旁坐下，母亲戴上眼镜，诵读一本大书，两个姑娘一边听着，一边纺线；一只小羊躺在她们身边，一只小白鸽蹲在她们背后的一根杆上，把头埋在翅膀底下。

一天晚上，她们这么和和美美地一起坐着，有人敲门，好像要求进屋。母亲说：“玫瑰红，快去开门，大概是个行路人想要投宿。”玫瑰红去拔门闩，心想这是一个可怜的男人；但不是，是一只熊把它那肥胖的黑乎乎的脑袋拱进门里。玫瑰红一声惊叫，后退几步；小羊咩咩叫，小白鸽扑打着翅膀，雪白躲在母亲的床后头。熊开口说话了，它说：“你们别害怕，我不会伤害你们的，我冻得半死，只想在你们这儿暖和暖和。”

“你这只可怜的熊，”母亲说，“在火旁边躺下吧，可要当心，别烧着你的毛皮。”她又大声说：“雪白，玫瑰红，出来吧，熊不会伤害你们，它说的是实话。”她们出来了，小羊和小鸽子也慢慢地靠拢过来，不怕它了。熊说：“孩子们，给我把毛皮上的雪拍打下来吧。”她们取来扫帚，把熊的皮扫干净；熊伸开四腿躺在火炉旁边，呼噜呼噜地哼哼，又高兴又舒服。不久，她们和它熟了，就戏弄这个笨拙的客人。她们扯熊的毛，踢它的背，把它推过来，推过去，或者用榛树枝抽它，熊哼叫，她们就笑。但熊心甘情愿让她们戏耍，只是在她们对它太恶作剧时，它就大叫：“让我活命吧，孩子们：雪白、玫瑰红，你们快打死你的求婚者了！”

睡觉的时间到了，别人都上床睡觉去了，母亲对熊说：“上帝保佑，你在炉灶旁边躺着不动，就不用担心寒冷和坏天气了。”天蒙蒙亮，两个孩子就开门放它出去，它踏着雪走进森林。从此，每天晚上熊在固定的时间来，躺在炉灶旁，让孩子们尽情戏耍；她们对它也习惯了，总要等到这黑色伙伴来了，才去闩门。

春天来了，大地一片葱绿，一天早晨，熊对雪白说：“现在我得走了，整整一个夏天都不能回来了。”

“亲爱的熊，你要去哪里？”雪白问。

“我得去森林里守护我的宝物，不让它们被凶恶的小矮人抢走。冬天大地冻硬了，他们只能待在地下，钻不出来。可是现在，大地被太阳晒得解冻了，晒得暖和了，他们就钻出来寻找、盗窃。不管什么东西，一旦落入他们手里，藏在他们洞中，就不容易重见天日了。”雪白对这次离别感到十分难过，她给熊拔门闩，熊挤出门时，被门钩卡住，撕下一块皮来，雪白似乎看见金子的闪光，但又不能十分肯定。熊急急忙忙跑了，转眼间消失在树林里面。

过了一段时间，母亲叫孩子们去森林里拣柴禾。她们看见野外有一棵大树被砍倒了放在地上，树干旁边的杂草中有个东西跳来跳去，但不知道是什么。走近一看，原来是一个小矮人，长着一张苍老而又憔悴的脸，长着长极了长极了的雪白的胡须。胡须末端夹在树缝里，小矮人就像一只拴在绳上的小狗那样跳来跳去，不知怎样才能摆脱困境。他瞪大两只火红的眼睛朝姑娘们大声喊叫：“你们站在这儿干什么！不能过来帮我一把吗？”

“你这是怎么回事，小矮人？”玫瑰红问。

“好奇的蠢鹅，”小矮人回答，“我要劈开树，拿小块木头去厨房烧火。我们不像你们这些粗鲁贪婪的人，吞食那么多东西，我们就只需要一点儿菜，烧大块木头一会儿就烧糊了。我已经把楔子打进木头里面，看来万事如意，可是这块该死的木头太滑溜，突然蹦出来，树干很快合拢，我来不及抽出我的漂亮的白胡须；胡须夹在树缝里，我没法走开。你们两个脸蛋光滑白嫩的蠢孩子还在笑！呸，真可恶！”

孩子们费尽力气，也没法把胡须拔出来，它夹得太紧了。“我去喊几个人来。”玫瑰红说。

“疯疯癫癫的傻丫头，”小矮人愤愤地说，“谁要你们去叫人？你们两个我看就太多了。你们就想不出好一点的办法吗？”

“别急，别急，”雪白说，“我有办法了！”她从口袋里取出小剪刀，铰断胡须的末端。小矮人一获得自由，马上抓住一只藏在树根之间、装满金子的口袋，一边提出来，一边叽里咕噜自言自语：“没教养的东西，把我的威严的胡须剪掉了一段！魔鬼会惩罚你们的！”说着，把口袋往背上一甩，也不再看孩子们一眼，掉转头就走了。

过些时候，雪白和玫瑰红要钓几条鱼做一道菜。她们走近小溪边，看见一个大蝗虫似的东西在水边蹦跶，好像要往水里跳。跑近前去，认得是那个小矮人。“你要去哪儿？”玫瑰红问，“该不是要下水吧？”

“我才不那么傻呢，”小矮人大声喊叫，“你们没看见吗，该死的鱼要把我拉下水！”原来小矮人坐在那儿钓鱼，很不幸，风一吹，他的胡须和钓竿的渔线纠缠在一起，这时刚巧有一条大鱼咬食，衰弱的矮人没有力气把鱼拉出水面。鱼占了上风，把矮人拉过去。尽管矮人拼命抓住草根，但却无济于事，不得不被鱼的游动所左右，随时有被拖下水去的危险。姑娘们来得正是时候，她们把他紧紧拉住，设法让胡须和渔线分开，但是不行：胡须和渔线紧紧缠在一起。没有别的办法，只好取出小剪刀，剪掉一小截胡须。矮人见了，冲她们高声怒骂：“你们两个淘气鬼，毁坏人家的容貌，太不像话了！你们剪掉我的胡须末端，还嫌不够，现在又把我最好的部分剪掉，我真没脸见我的家里人了。你们快跑开吧，跑得掉了鞋底才好！”说完，他去拿放在芦苇里面的一口袋珍珠，一句话也不多说，拖了就走，转过一块石头后面，就不见了。

不久，母亲叫两个女孩进城买针线、绳子和带子。她们走的路经过一片旷野，旷野上随处零零散散地堆放着大块岩石。她们看见一只大鸟在空中飞翔，在她们头顶上缓慢盘旋，越飞越低，后来便向不远处的一块岩石俯冲下去，随即听到一声凄厉的哀号。她们跑过去，见那情景，大吃一惊，老鹰抓住了她们的老相识——那个矮人，要把他攫走。两个好心肠的孩子马上紧紧拽住那小矮人，同老鹰拉来拉去，争夺了很长时间，才使老鹰放开它的猎物。矮人受到惊吓，定了定神后，用尖锐刺耳的声音喊道：“你们就不会对我小心点儿吗？你们又拉又拽，把我薄薄的衣服都扯碎了，弄出许多窟窿眼来，真是笨手笨脚的蠢丫头！”说完，提起一口袋宝石，又钻进岩石下边他的洞里去了。两个小姑娘已经习惯了他的忘恩负义，继续走她们的路，去城里买东西。回家时她们还从那片旷野走过，把那个矮人吓了一跳，矮人那时正把一口袋宝石倒在一块干净的地方，他没想到天这么晚了，还会有人来。夕阳照在亮晶晶的宝石上，色彩斑斓的宝石毫光四射，富丽无比，引得孩子停下脚步观赏。“你们站在这里张大嘴巴看什么？!”矮人大喊大叫，发灰的脸气得变成朱砂一样红。他还要继续骂下去，忽听得一声咆哮，从森林里窜出一只黑熊来。矮人大惊，跳了起来，但他来不及钻进洞里，熊已经到他身边。他吓得要死，大声喊道：“亲爱的熊先生，饶了我吧，我情愿把我所有的珍宝统统给您，您看看这里这些美丽的宝石吧。请您饶我一命，我一个又矮小又瘦弱的人对您有什么意思？还不够塞您的牙缝。这两个邪恶的女孩倒是您的两块嫩肉，像雏鹌鹑一样肥肥的。上帝保佑，您把她们抓去吃吧。”熊不听他胡说，抬起熊掌，一下就把那坏家伙打得再也不能动弹。

两个小姑娘跑了，熊在后面喊她们：“雪白，玫瑰红，别害怕，等等我，我要和你们一起走！”她们听出它的声音，站住了，熊来到她们身边，熊皮忽然脱落，眼前站着一个美男子，全身衣服都是金子做的。他说：“我是一个王子，那个邪恶的矮人偷了我的珠宝，又施了魔法，把我变成一只野熊在森林里奔跑，直到他死后我才能得救。现在他已得到应有的惩罚。”

雪白和王子结婚，玫瑰红和王子的弟弟结了婚，他们一起分了矮人聚敛到他洞中的大批珠宝。老母亲安宁幸福地和她的孩子们一起生活了好多年。她把两株玫瑰树移栽到她的窗前，它们年年开出美丽的玫瑰花，白玫瑰和红玫瑰。





玻璃棺材


谁都不能说一个穷裁缝就成不了大事，不能获得崇高的荣誉。只要他找对了门路，别的都无所谓，重要的是要有好运气。有一次，一个乖巧灵活的小裁缝出门漫游，走进一座大森林，在森林里迷了路。夜幕降临，他没有别的办法，只得在这可怖的寂寥中寻找睡觉的地方。柔软的苔藓自然是不错的床褥，只是害怕有野兽，他无法安宁，最后只好决定在树上过夜。他找了一棵高高的橡树，一直爬到树梢，谢天谢地，多亏他身上带着熨斗，否则刮过树梢的风准得把他卷走。

他哆哆嗦嗦，惊恐不安地在黑暗中度过了几个钟头，看见不远处有一点灯光，他想，那儿一定有人家，到那儿去要比在树上待着好些，便小心翼翼地从树上爬下来，朝灯光走去，来到一座用芦苇和灯芯草编成的小屋前面。他大胆地敲门，门开了，灯光下，他看见一个头发花白的小老头，身上穿的衣服是用五颜六色的碎布拼接起来的。“你是什么人，你要干什么？”小老头粗声粗气地问道。“我是一个穷裁缝，”他回答说，“黑夜里独自一人在这荒野，恳求您收留我，让我在您的茅草屋住一夜吧。”

“走你的路去吧，”老头子说，口气很不友好，“我不和流浪汉打交道。你去别处找个地方住吧。”说完就要回屋里去，裁缝紧紧揪住他的衣角哀求他，这老头看上去样子凶狠，其实心地不坏，他心软了，把裁缝带进屋里，给他吃的，又把房间一角一个不错的铺位给他睡觉。

疲乏的裁缝不需要人哄就睡得很香甜，要不是一阵喧闹声把他从睡梦中惊醒，他还想不到该起床呢。猛烈的嘶鸣和咆哮声穿过薄薄的墙壁传到屋里来。裁缝也不知道哪儿来的胆量，跳起来匆忙穿上衣服就往门外跑，只见一只大黑牛和一只美丽的鹿在小屋附近猛烈搏斗。它们怒气冲冲地向对方扑过去，大地被它们踹得颤抖起来，它们的嘶鸣和咆哮在空中震荡，斗了多时，仍然不分胜负。终于，鹿把它的角插进对手的肚子里去，随着一声骇人的吼叫，黑牛扑倒在地上，又挨了鹿几下猛击，黑牛断气了。

裁缝一直在吃惊地观战，那只鹿飞快向他跳去，他还是站着不动，没等他拔腿逃跑，鹿角已经把他叉了起来。那只鹿迅跑如飞，越过田野、山谷、草地和树林，他来不及多想，双手紧紧抓住鹿角，听天由命。他觉得就像在飞似的。那只鹿终于在一块岩壁前停下，轻轻放下裁缝。裁缝已经半死不活，好长时候才清醒过来。鹿一直站在他身边，等他恢复好些了，它用鹿角使劲推岩壁上的一道门。门被推开了，从门内喷出火焰，蒸汽随之而来，使他看不见那只鹿。裁缝不知该朝哪个方向走，该怎么办，才能离开这蛮荒之地，重新回到人群中去。他犹豫不决地站在那儿，这当儿，他听见岩石里面有一个声音向他呼唤：“进来吧，不要害怕，我不会伤害你的。”他虽然犹疑，却由于受一种神秘力量的驱使而听从了那个声音的召唤，便穿过铁门，走进一个宽敞的大厅。大厅的天花板、墙壁和地板都是用打磨得亮光闪闪的方方正正的石头砌成的，每一块方石上都刻着他不认识的符号。他十分惊奇地观察这一切，正想抽身退出，又听见那声音对他说：“踏上大厅正中那块方石，你就有福了。”

他的胆量已经大到敢于遵照那命令行事。那块方石在他脚下慢慢下沉。他又站稳脚跟的时候，环顾四周，那是一个大厅，大小和上面那个大厅完全一样，但是可供观赏、令人赞叹的东西还更多。墙上刻有若干深凹的处所，里面有透明的玻璃器皿，装满有颜色的酒精或充满淡蓝色烟雾。大厅地面上相对而立的两口大玻璃箱立即激起他的好奇心。他走近其中一口玻璃箱跟前，看见里面有一座宛如宫殿的美丽的建筑，周围有农庄、畜厩、仓廪诸如此类的东西。一切都很小，但精雕细刻，又极精确，似乎出自艺术家之手。

如果他不是又听见那声音的话，他的眼睛还会继续欣赏这些稀世珍品，无暇他顾。那个声音要他转过身子，去看对面的玻璃箱。他看见玻璃箱里躺着一位美貌绝伦的少女，感到无比惊奇。那少女如在睡梦中，长长的金黄色发丝犹如一袭大衣包裹着她的全身。她双眼紧闭，但她生机盎然的面色和因她的呼吸而来回飘动的带子都令人毫不怀疑她是活人。裁缝端详这位美人，心跳不止，忽然，她睁开眼睛，看见他在身旁，惊喜万分。“苍天有眼，”她大声说，“我就要获得解放了！快，快，快救我出这牢狱：你只要把这玻璃棺材上的闩子推开，我就得救了。”裁缝毫不犹豫，遵命照办，她很快掀开玻璃盖，走了出来，迅速去大厅角落，用一件肥大的外衣把全身包裹起来。随后她在一块石头上坐下，叫那年轻人走上前去，在他的嘴上印下一个亲昵的吻，之后，她说：“我盼望已久的解放者，是仁慈的上天引导你来到我这儿，结束我的苦难。我的苦难到头之日，就是你的幸福开始之时。你是上天指定的我的丈夫，注定要获得我的爱情，拥有人世间的一切财富，无扰地在欢乐中度过一生。坐下，让我把我的遭遇讲给你听：

“我是一位富有的伯爵的女儿，我年幼时父母就去世了，遵照父母的遗愿，把我托付给我哥哥，由他抚养我长大成人。我和哥哥亲密无间，志趣相投，我们两人决定永远不结婚，一直到死，永远相依为伴。我们家中向来不乏社交活动：时常有邻居、友人来看望我们，我们对所有的来宾都竭力殷勤招待。一天晚上，一个骑马的陌生人来到我们的伯爵府第，他说他来不及赶到下一个住宿地点，请求借宿。我们友好地接受了他的请求。晚餐席间和他的交谈以及他在谈话中穿插讲述的故事，使我们感到异常愉快。我哥哥非常喜欢他，请他在我们家里多住几天，他略表推辞，便同意了。直至夜深，我们才散席。客人被领去一个房间，我很疲累，赶快去柔软的床上躺下。我刚微微入睡，就被一阵细微而动听的音乐唤醒。我不知道是哪儿来的音乐，正要叫唤睡在隔壁房间的侍女，这才惊讶地发现，犹如梦魇压迫我胸脯，一种陌生的力量使我失去语言能力，我连一点细微的声音也发不出来了。我在夜间的灯光下，看见那个陌生人穿过两道紧锁着的门走进我的房间里来。他向我走过来，说他施了魔法，用优美动听的音乐把我唤醒，现在亲自穿过重重锁闭的门，就是为了向我求婚。我非常讨厌他施行魔法，根本不屑给予回答。他一动不动地在那里站了好一会儿，很可能是在期待得到一个对他有利的决定。后来见我始终沉默不语，他便恼怒地宣称他要报复，而且会有办法惩罚我的傲慢，说完便离开房间走了。这一夜，我极度不安，天快亮时才蒙眬入睡。醒来后我赶紧去找哥哥，要告诉他发生的事情，可是在他的房间里没能找到他，仆人告诉我，拂晓时分他骑马和那陌生人一起打猎去了。

“我马上预感到事情不妙，迅速穿好衣服，叫人给我的坐骑备好马鞍，向森林疾驰而去，只有一个仆人跟随我。途中，仆人和马一起摔倒，马腿折断，他不能随我一同去了。我马不停蹄地继续赶路，几分钟后，看见那个陌生人用绳子牵着一只美丽的鹿向我走过来。泪水从这只鹿的一双大眼睛里滚滚而下。我问他把我哥哥弄到哪里去了，他怎么弄到这只鹿的。他哈哈大笑，不回答我的问话。我愤怒至极，拔出手枪，对准这坏蛋射击，可是子弹从他的胸膛反弹回来，射进我的马的脑袋。我摔倒在地上，随后陌生人念念有词，我就失去知觉了。

“我又恢复知觉的时候，发现自己在这地下墓穴的一个玻璃棺材里面。那个魔法师又出现一次，说他把我的哥哥变成了一只鹿，把我的宫殿和属于宫殿的一切缩小了，锁在另一个玻璃棺材里面，把我的手下人变成烟雾封在了玻璃瓶里面。如果我现在肯顺从他，让他称心如意，他很容易就可以使一切恢复原先的状况，只要打开器皿，一切就都会恢复本来的自然形态。我照旧不理会他。他不见了，让我躺在我的牢狱里，陷入了深沉的睡眠。时常有些幻景飘入我的梦中，其中一个使我感到安慰的梦，是梦到一个年轻人来解救我。今天我睁开眼睛，看见了你，我知道我的梦就要圆了，请你帮助我实现我梦中所见的一切。首先要把装着我的宫殿的玻璃箱搬到那块宽大的石板上来。”

石头一承受重压，便载着少女和年轻人一起升高，穿过地板上的孔洞到上面的大厅上来，在这里，他们不费事就到外面来了。姑娘打开箱盖；看着宫殿、房屋、农庄以极快的速度自行伸展开来，恢复到原先的大小，真是无比奇妙。他们随即回到地下洞穴，把充满烟雾的瓶子都搬到石头上运上来。姑娘一打开瓶塞，蓝色烟雾喷涌出来，变成活生生的人，姑娘认得这些就是她的仆人和手下人。当她的哥哥杀死那个变成大黑牛的魔法师，恢复了人形，从森林里走出来的时候，她更高兴得不得了。就在这一天，姑娘依照她的承诺，在祭坛前面和幸运的裁缝结为夫妻。





贫穷农夫在天国


有一回，一个虔诚、贫穷的农夫死了，来到天堂大门口。同时，有一个很富有的绅士也等在那里，要进天堂。圣彼得拿钥匙来开门，让那个绅士进去；他好像没看见农夫，又把门关上。农夫在门外听见绅士在天堂里面受到热烈欢迎，还有人在里面唱歌、奏乐。终于又安静下来了，圣彼得来打开天堂的大门，让农夫进去。农夫以为他进去的时候，也会有人为他唱歌、奏乐，然而没有，天堂里一片静寂，他只是受到亲切的接待，天使们向他走来，但是没有一个人唱歌。农夫便问圣彼得，为什么富人进来的时候有歌声欢迎他，他进来的时候却没有，看来在天上也像在人间一样有厚薄亲疏之分。圣彼得说：“不，没有这回事，你像所有其他人一样受欢迎，你也会像那个富有的绅士一样享受到所有天国的欢乐。但是你看，像你这么贫穷的农夫，天天都有进天堂的，但是一百年才有一个富人进天堂。”





女水妖


从前有一个磨坊主，和妻子一起过着快乐的生活。他们有钱，有田产，一年比一年富裕。可是一夜之间，不幸降临：当初他的财富增长迅速，如今一年年急遽减少，到头来磨坊主连他自己住的磨坊都很难说是他的了。他忧虑重重，白天干了一天活，夜里躺在床上，辗转反侧，无法安宁。

有一天，天还没亮他就起来，想到外面去散散心。他走过磨坊水堤，朝阳正射来第一道旭光，他听见水塘里有哗哗的水声，回头一看，只见一个美貌女子从水里缓缓升起来。被她娇嫩的双手拢住的长长的头发越过她的肩膀，从两侧流泻下来，遮住她白皙的身躯。他很清楚这是池塘里的女水妖，由于害怕，他不晓得自己该逃走还是该站住不动。女水妖温柔的声音叫着他的名字，问他为什么这样悲哀。磨坊主起初默不作声，后来听她说话十分和气友善，便鼓起勇气，向她讲述以前他的生活多么幸福富裕，现在多么贫困，自己也不知道该怎么办才好。“你放心，”女水妖回答说，“我能使你比从前更富裕、更幸福，只是你得答应把你家里刚生下来的给我。”

“除了生个小狗、小猫，”磨坊主心里想，“还能生什么？”便答应了她的要求。女水妖又沉下水去，磨坊主心情愉快，充满信心地快步走回磨坊。他还没到家里，使女就走出门口朝他大声喊，说他有喜事了，他的妻子给他生了一个男孩。磨坊主像触了电似的站住。他明白了：狡猾的女水妖早已知道，骗他上当。他低着头走到妻子床前，妻子问他：“这个男孩这么漂亮，你怎么不高兴？”他把遇见女水妖和他答应女水妖的事向她讲了。“如果失去孩子，”他接着说，“幸福和财富有什么用？我该怎么办呢？”对此，前来贺喜的亲戚也想不出什么好办法。

在此期间，磨坊主家又福星高照了。不管他做什么，总能成功，箱子、柜子仿佛自己装满了似的，一夜之间，柜橱里的钱多起来了。没过多久，他的财富就比以前还要多。但他并不快活：对女水妖的许诺使他心中痛苦。每当他走到水塘边，总担心女水妖会从水里冒出来向他讨债。他严禁男孩走近水塘边。“你要小心，”他对孩子说，“你一碰到水塘的水，就会有一只手伸出来抓住你，把你拖下水去。”然而时光流逝，年复一年，女水妖没再出现，磨坊主心里才踏实下来。

那男孩长成了小伙子，跟随一个猎人学艺，学成归来，成了一个精明能干的猎人，村里的老爷雇用了他。村子里有一个美丽率真的姑娘，猎人很喜欢她，老爷知道了，送给他一所小房子。两人举行了婚礼，倾心相爱，过着安宁幸福的生活。

有一天，猎人追赶一只鹿。那只鹿从森林里奔逃到旷野上，猎人紧追不舍，终于一枪把它撂倒在地上。但他没察觉自己就在那危险的水塘附近，取出猎物的内脏后，他双手沾满了血，便走去水塘边洗手。他的手刚伸进水里，女水妖就升上来，伸出湿淋淋的臂膀，笑着搂住他，把他拖下水去，波浪很快就淹没了他的头顶。

到了晚上，猎人没有回家，他的妻子担心他，就跑出去找他，以前他常跟她讲起他必须提防女水妖暗算，不敢走近水塘边，所以她已有出事了的不祥预感。她匆匆赶去水塘，看见猎人的袋子放在岸边，她已不再怀疑是不是大祸临头了。她悲痛万分，绞着双手，呼喊至爱的亲人的名字，然而无济于事；她又跑到水塘对岸呼唤他，狠狠咒骂女水妖，还是没有任何回答。池水如镜，平静无波，水底下只有月亮的半张脸一动不动地仰望着她。

可怜的妻子仍不离开水塘。她绕着它一圈又一圈地快步疾走，有时默不作声，有时发出一声激烈的呼喊，有时口中低声喃喃，绝不休息。最后她终于精疲力尽，倒在地上睡着了，睡得很深沉。不一会儿她就做了一个梦。

她梦见自己在巨大的岩石之间向上爬，心里惊惧万分；荆棘、藤蔓钩她的脚，雨打着她的脸，风吹乱她长长的头发。她爬上山顶，映入眼帘的是截然不同的另一番景象。天蓝蓝的，柔风轻拂，地缓缓下沉，在一片姹紫嫣红鲜花怒放的葱绿草地上，有一座干净的草屋。她走过去推开草屋的门，一个白发老妇人坐在屋里，向她和蔼地招手。就在这时，这个可怜的女人醒了。天已经亮了，她决定立即遵从梦中的指引。她艰难地爬上山顶，一切和夜里梦中所见一样。老妇人亲切接待她，指着一张椅子叫她坐下。“你找到我这孤寂的草屋，一定有不幸的遭遇。”老妇人说。女人含泪向她讲述了她的遭遇。“你放心吧，”老婆婆说，“我会帮助你，给你一把金梳子。你要耐心等待，等到圆月升上天空，那时你就去坐在池塘边上，用这把梳子梳你的长长的黑发，梳完了，把梳子放在池塘岸边，你就会看见要发生的事情。”

女人回去等待月圆，觉得时间过得很慢。一轮明月终于升上天空，她走出家门，来到池塘边坐下，用金梳子梳理她长长的黑色的头发，梳完了，把梳子放在池塘岸边。不久，哗啦一声，从水深处掀起一股波浪，卷到岸边，卷走了金梳子。很快，过了大约金梳子沉到水底所需要的那么长时间，水面分开了，猎人的头冒了出来。他不说话，悲哀地凝视着他的妻子。就在这一瞬间，第二股波浪哗啦啦卷过来，盖住猎人的脑袋。一切都消失了，池塘又平静如初，只有圆月的面庞在池面上闪光。

女人绝望地回家，梦中她又见到老婆婆的草屋。第二天早晨她再次上路，向智慧的老妇人诉说她的苦难。老婆婆给她一支金笛，说：“你要耐心等待，等到圆月再升上天空，你就去坐在池塘边上，用这支金笛吹奏出一首美妙的曲子，吹完了，把笛子放在池塘岸边，你就会看见要发生的事情。”

女人照老婆婆说的去做。笛子刚放在池塘岸边，哗啦一声，从水深处掀起一股波浪，卷到岸边，卷走了金笛。池水随即分开，不仅仅猎人的头，而且他的半个身子都露出了水面。他充满渴望地朝她张开双臂，但是第二股浪头喧嚣而来，盖住他，又把他拖下水去。

“啊，”不幸的女子说，“我只见到我至爱的亲人一面，就又失去了他，这有何用？”她的心里又充满了哀伤，但她第三次来到老婆婆那座草屋。智慧的老妇人给她一个金纺车，安慰她说：“不是所有的事情都做完了，你要耐心等待，等到圆月再升上天空，那时你就带上这辆纺车去坐在池塘边纺线，纺一满轴，纺完了，把纺车放在池塘岸边，你就会看见要发生的事情。”

女人完全照此办理。圆月一升上天空，她就把金纺车搬到池塘边辛勤纺线，直到亚麻纺完，线轴缠满了线。她刚把金纺车放在岸边，水深处响起比前两次都更厉害的喧嚣声，一阵大浪汹涌而来，卷走了纺车。随即，猎人的头和全身随着一股涌起的水柱一起升上来。他迅速跳到岸上，拉着妻子的手一起逃跑。可是，他们才走了一小段路程，整个池塘的水汹涌澎湃，发出惊心动魄的咆哮，迅猛地冲向广阔的原野。两个逃亡者看见死期已近在眼前。惊恐中，妻子向老婆婆呼救，就在这一瞬间，他们变了，她变成一只蛤蟆，他变成一只青蛙。洪水淹到他们身边，淹不死他们，但冲散了他们俩，把他们冲到很远很远的地方。

水退了，他们两个接触到干的土地，又都恢复了原先的人形。但谁都不知道另一个人在什么地方。他们生活在陌生人中间，人们对他们的家乡一无所知。他们只好以牧羊谋生，长年累月赶着羊群，穿过田野和森林，心中充满悲伤和思念。

又一年春回大地，两人在同一天出来放羊，他们偶然走近了彼此。他看见远远的山坡上有一群羊，便赶着羊群到那儿去。他们在一个山谷里相遇，两人谁都没有认出对方来，但他们都为不再孤独一人而高兴。从此他们天天一起放羊，他们说话不多，但心情愉快。一天晚上，皓月当空，羊儿都已睡了，牧羊人从口袋里取出笛子，吹了一支优美而哀伤的曲子。一曲终了，他发现牧羊女在伤心地哭泣。“你为什么哭泣？”他问道。“啊，”她回答说，“我最后一次用笛子吹奏这支曲子，看见我至爱的亲人从水里冒出头来的时候，天上也是这样的满月。”他凝视着她，仿佛一下子去掉了遮眼布：他认出了他的妻子；当月光照在他的脸上，她也认出了他。他们拥抱、亲吻。他们是否幸福，那就不用问了。





矮人的礼物


一个裁缝和一个金匠结伴漫游。一天傍晚，太阳下山后，他们听到远远地传来音乐声，越来越清晰；那乐声很不寻常，非常优美，他们听了，便忘记一切疲劳，继续快步往前走。月亮升起来了，他们走到一座小山前，看见山上有一群矮小的男人和女人手拉着手，正围成圆圈跳舞。矮人们非常快乐地舞蹈，边舞边唱极动听的歌，这就是方才漫游者听到的音乐。人群正中间坐着一位老者，他比其他人稍高一些，身穿一件色彩斑斓的外衣，一副斑白的长须飘垂胸前。两人停下脚步，惊讶不已地观看舞蹈。老者招手要他们进去，众小矮人欣然让出一个入口。金匠是个驼背，天下的驼子胆子都很大，金匠也是如此，他先走进矮人圈里；裁缝开始有点胆怯，站着不动，后来看那场景十分有趣，便壮起胆子，随后跟了进去。跳舞的圆圈迅速又围拢起来，小矮人们继续且歌且舞，他们的舞跳得极其狂野。老者取下腰带上佩带的一把大刀磨起来，磨得足够锋利的时候，老者回头看两个陌生人。两人心里害怕，他们还没来得及多想，老者就抓住金匠，迅捷无比地把他的头发、胡须剃得精光，接着对裁缝也如法炮制。他们的恐惧心理消失了。做完这事，老者亲切地拍拍两人的肩膀，好像是要表示：他们顺从地听凭他摆布，做得不错。他用手指指着堆放在边上的一堆煤，打手势要他们把煤装满他们的口袋。两人遵命照办，虽然并不明白要这些煤有什么用处。之后，两人便继续往前走，要找个过夜的地方。他们进了山谷，附近的修道院钟敲十二下，霎时间歌声沉寂，一切消失得无影无踪，月光下的小山分外寂静。

两个漫游者找到一家旅店，躺在干草铺上，身上盖上自己的衣服。因为十分劳累，忘了把煤块先拿出来。沉重的东西压着手和脚，所以他们醒得比平常早。一掏口袋，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，原来他们装的不是煤块，而是纯金，头发、胡须也原样长着，毫发无损。现在他们俩都成了富人了。金匠生性贪婪，口袋装得更满，比裁缝还多一倍。但他贪心不足，还想要更多。金匠向裁缝建议再多住一天，晚上再去找山上的小老头要更多财宝。裁缝不愿去，他说：“我已经够多了，心满意足了。我这就当师傅去，娶我那舒服的东西（他这样称呼他的恋人），我是个幸福的男人了。”但他为了让金匠高兴，同意在那儿再多待一天。晚上，金匠想尽量多装些，还在肩上搭了几条口袋，然后上山。和前一天夜里一样，他看见小矮人们且歌且舞，那老者又把他剃得精光，示意他去取煤。他毫不犹豫，把他所有的口袋都装得满满当当，心里美滋滋地回去，盖上衣服睡觉。“金子压得再厉害，”他说，“我也能忍受。”终于，他怀着明天一早醒来就是个大富翁的甜蜜梦想睡着了。他一睁开眼睛就赶紧起床，检查口袋，可是不论掏多少次，掏出来的都是黑黝黝的煤块，他惊呆了。“我还有昨天夜里得到的金子。”他想，便拿了出来，看到那些东西也都变成了煤块，大吃一惊。他举起沾满煤屑的手拍打额头，觉得整个脑袋光溜溜的，连胡须一根也没了。但他的厄运并未到此为止，到这时他才发现，除了背上隆起的驼包之外，他的胸前还长出一块同样大小的肉团。他知道这是对他的贪婪的惩罚，便放声大哭起来。好心的裁缝被他的哭声吵醒了，尽力安慰这不幸的人，裁缝说：“我们是漫游的伙伴，你就留在我身边吧，一起分享我的财富。”裁缝信守诺言，可怜的金匠却得一辈子带着两坨肉团，用帽子遮盖他那光秃秃的脑袋。





钉子


一个商人在一年一次的年市上做了几笔好生意，货物都卖出去了，钱袋里装满了金子、银子。他现在就要回家，想在夜幕降临之前赶到家里。于是他把放着钱的旅行提包绑在马背上，骑马走。中午，他在一个城镇稍事休息，要继续走的时候，仆人把他骑的马牵到他跟前来，说：“主人，它左边后蹄的马蹄铁少了个钉子。”

“少就少吧，”商人回答说，“再走六个钟头就到了，马蹄铁大概掉不了。时间很紧顾不得了。”下午，他又下马，叫人给马喂食的时候，仆人到房间里来，说：“主人，您的马左边后蹄的马蹄铁掉了。要牵去找铁匠吗？”

“掉就掉了吧，”主人回答说，“就剩几个钟头了，马大概能顶得下来。时间很紧。”他骑马继续赶路，可是没过多久，马跛了，一瘸一拐地走着；一瘸一拐地走不多久，它开始跌跌撞撞地走着；跌跌撞撞地走不多久，马摔倒在地上，跌断了一条马腿。商人只好让马躺在那里，解下旅行提包自己背在肩上，徒步走回去，直到深夜才走到家里。他自言自语说：“所有的不幸都是那根可恶的钉子造成的。真是欲速则不达。”





农夫和魔鬼


从前有一个聪明狡猾的农夫，关于他的恶作剧广为流传，但最有意思的故事是讲他如何智胜魔鬼、愚弄魔鬼的。

有一天，农夫耕完了地，准备回家时，已经暮色苍茫。他看见就在他的庄稼地当中燃着一堆煤，十分惊奇，走近前去，只见煤火上坐着一个黑色的小鬼。“你是坐在一堆财宝上吧？”农夫说。

“不错，”魔鬼回答说，“这堆财宝里的金银比你一辈子见过的还多。”

“财宝在我的庄稼地里，财宝是我的！”农夫说。

“如果连续两年你把这庄稼地的收成分一半给我，”魔鬼回答说，“财宝就是你的了。钱我有的是，但我想要土地的果实。”农夫同意了这个交易。他说：“为了避免分东西的时候引起争执，地上的东西归你，地下的东西归我。”这种分法魔鬼很高兴，但是诡计多端的农夫却播种萝卜。到了收成的季节，魔鬼来要它的果实，见到的只是枯黄的败叶，农夫高高兴兴地挖他的萝卜。“你占了一回便宜，下次不能再叫你占便宜了。地上长的是你的，地下的是我的。”魔鬼生气地说。

“这样也好。”农夫回答说。播种的季节到了，农夫这一次不再播种萝卜了，他播种小麦。小麦熟了，他去地里把长满麦穗的麦秆贴着地都收割了。魔鬼来了，只看见麦茬，怒气冲冲地跑到岩缝里面去了。“对狐狸就得这么骗它！”农夫说着便去取那批财宝了。





鼓手


一天晚上，一个年轻鼓手独自走在田野上，他走到一个湖边，看见岸上有三块白色亚麻布。“多么精细的亚麻啊，”说着，他便捡一块放在自己口袋里。回到家里，他也没再想起捡到的东西，就上床睡觉去了。刚要入睡，恍惚听见有人在叫他的名字。凝神细听，一个轻柔的声音在呼唤他：“鼓手，鼓手，醒来吧。”漆黑的夜里，他看不见人，只觉得有个人影在他的床前来回移动。“你要干什么？”他问。

“你昨晚在湖边拿走了我的衬衣，”那声音回答说，“请你把它还给我。”

“告诉我，你是谁？”鼓手说，“我就还你。”

“啊，”那声音回答说，“我是一个强国的公主，落入一个巫婆手里，被困在玻璃山上。每天我必须和我的两个姐妹一起在湖里洗浴，丢了衬衣我就无法飞回去。我的姐妹已经飞走了，我还不得不留在这里。求求你把我的衬衣还给我吧。”

“不要着急，可怜的孩子，”鼓手说，“我很乐意还给你。”他从口袋里取出那块亚麻布，在黑暗中递给她。她一把抓住，就要匆匆离去。“等一等，”他说，“说不定我能帮助你。”

“你要帮助我，就得上玻璃山，把我从巫婆手里救出来。但是你无法去玻璃山，即使到了山前，也爬不上去。”

“我要做什么，就一定能做到，”鼓手说，“我同情你，我什么都不怕，就是不知道要去玻璃山该走哪条路。”

“去玻璃山的路穿过一座大森林，森林里有吃人的巨人，”她回答说，“我只能讲这些，不能再多说了。”随后，他听见她飞走了。

鼓手天亮就起身，挂上鼓，毫不畏惧地径直走进森林。走了一会儿，没看见巨人，他想：“我得把睡懒觉的家伙叫醒。”就把鼓挂在身前，一通鼓打得树上的鸟儿惊叫着飞起来。很快就有一个躺在草里睡觉的巨人站起来，就像一棵枞树那么高。“你这个小家伙，”巨人向鼓手喊道，“我睡得正香，你为什么在这里敲鼓，把我吵醒？”

“我后面还有几千人要来，”鼓手回答说，“我敲鼓是为了给他们引路。”

“他们来我的森林里干什么？”巨人问。

“他们来干掉你，清除森林里像你一样的怪物。”

“哎呀呀，”巨人说“，我踩死你们还不是像踩死蚂蚁一样容易？”

“你以为你对付得了他们？”鼓手说，“你弯腰去抓一个人，他就逃走，躲起来；你躺下想睡觉，他们就从所有的树丛里出来，爬到你身上。他们个个腰带上掖着一把钢锤，要用它来砸你的天灵盖。”巨人心里懊恼，他想：“和这些狡猾的人斗，最后我恐怕要吃亏。我能卡住狼和熊的咽喉，却对付不了蚯蚓。”他说：“听着，小家伙，你撤回去吧，我向你承诺：将来我不会找你和你的伙伴麻烦，如果你还有什么愿望，就告诉我，我想做一点让你高兴的事情。”

“你腿长，比我走得快，”鼓手说，“把我背到玻璃山吧，我就给我的人发个信号，让他们撤退，这次不让他们给你找麻烦了。”

“来吧，小虫子，”巨人说，“坐在我的肩膀上，你要去哪儿，我就背你去哪儿。”巨人把他提起来放在肩上，鼓手在上面尽兴地打鼓，巨人还以为他是在发信号让其他人撤退呢。过一会儿，又一个巨人站在路旁，把鼓手从第一个巨人肩上拿下来，放在自己衣服的纽扣眼里。纽扣像盆那么大，鼓手紧紧扒住纽扣，快乐地朝四下里张望。途中他们又见到第三个巨人，他把鼓手接过去，放在他的帽檐上。鼓手在上面走来走去，目光越过树梢远眺前方，看见蔚蓝色的远方有一座山，他笑了，心想，这一定就是玻璃山了。果然不错。那巨人又走几步，便到了山脚下。巨人把他放下来，鼓手要求把他背到玻璃山上去，巨人摇摇头，嘟囔了几句，就回森林里去了。

可怜的鼓手站在山下，山极高，仿佛三座山摞在一起似的，玻璃山光滑如镜，他要上山，却不知道如何才能上去。他开始爬山，但总是劳而无功，一而再、再而三地滑下来。“我要是一只鸟儿就好了。”他想。可是这么企盼有何用呢？他也没能长出翅膀来。他束手无策站在那儿，看见不远处有两个男人在激烈争吵。他朝他们走去，原来是为了一个马鞍发生争执，马鞍就在他们跟前的地上放着，两人都想据为己有。“你们真傻，”他说，“为一个马鞍争吵不休，又没有马骑。”

“这马鞍很值得一争，”两人中的一人说，“谁坐在这马鞍上，他即使到世界的尽头，只要他说出愿望，眨眼间就到了。它本是我们共有的，现在该轮到我骑在马鞍上了，可他却不让。”

“我能很快调停这起纠纷，”鼓手说着，走了一段路，把一根白色的棍子插在地上，走回来后说：“现在你们就朝那目标跑去，谁先到，谁就先骑。”那两人发足狂奔，没等他们跑多远，鼓手翻身骑上马鞍，说他要上玻璃山，还不到翻掌的工夫，人已经在那里了。玻璃山上有一块平地，平地上有一座年久的石屋，石屋前面有一个大鱼塘，鱼塘后面是一片黝黑的森林。他看不见人，看不见动物，四外静寂，只有风吹过树木的沙沙声，云几乎贴着他的头顶飘走。他走到门前敲门，敲了三次，才有一个褐色面皮、红眼睛的老婆子来开门；她长长的鼻子上架着一副眼镜，目光锐利地看着他，问他要干什么。“让我进去，供我食宿。”鼓手回答说。

“可以，”老婆子回答说，“不过你得做三件事。”

“没问题！”鼓手回答说，“我生来不怕干活，再重的活也不怕。”老婆子让他进去，给他饭吃，晚上让他睡一张很好的床铺。早晨，他睡醒了，老婆子从她干瘪的手指上脱下一枚顶针，递给鼓手，说：“现在去干活，用这枚顶针把外面池塘里的水舀干，入夜之前必须干完，而且池塘里所有的鱼都要按不同品种大小顺序排好。”

“这是个罕见的工作。”鼓手说着，去池塘动手舀水。整整舀了一上午也毫无起色。用一枚顶针舀一口大池塘的水，即使舀一千年，能有什么结果？中午时分，他想：“全都白费力气，干不干还不是一个样？”他不干了，坐下来。这时屋里走出来一位姑娘，把一个盛着午饭的篮子放在他跟前，说：“你坐在这里这么悲哀，是病了吗？”他望着她，看见她非常美。

“啊，”他说，“第一个工作我就完不成，其他的工作怎么办呢？我是出来找一位公主的，她说她住在这里，可我没见到她。我想继续往前走。”

“留在这里吧，”姑娘说，“我要帮助你摆脱困境。你累了，把你的头枕在我怀里睡吧。你睡醒了，事情也就做完了。”鼓手没等她再说第二遍。他一闭上眼睛，姑娘就转动如意戒指，说：“水升上来，鱼儿出来。”立时，池水犹如一片白雾升上高空，和其他云朵一起飘走，鱼儿喘着粗气蹦到岸上，自行按照不同种类和大小排列整齐。鼓手醒来，看见大功告成，惊奇不已。姑娘却说：“有一条鱼不跟同类排在一起，自己单独待着。老太婆今天晚上来，看见一切都照她的要求做了，如果她问：‘这条鱼怎么单独在这儿？’你就把鱼朝她脸上扔去，说：‘这条鱼是给你的，老巫婆。'”

晚上，老婆子来了，她问了那句话，鼓手就把鱼往她脸上扔过去。她装作没看见的样子，却目露凶光盯着他看。

翌日早晨，老婆子说：“昨天的活你干得太容易了，我得给你重一点的活。今天你要把整座森林的树都砍倒，把木头劈了，码成六尺高的柴垛，晚上必须全部做完。”她给他一把斧、一把锤和两个楔子。但斧是铅斧，锤和楔子都是白铁做的。他一砍树，斧刃就卷了，锤子、楔子都砸瘪了。他束手无策。中午，姑娘又带了食物来安慰他。“你的头枕在我怀里，”她说，“睡吧，睡醒了，事情也就做完了。”她转动她的如意戒指。顷刻间，整座森林里的树全都哗啦啦倒了，木头自己劈成小块木柴，自行堆成六尺高的柴垛，仿佛有眼不可见的巨人在完成这工作似的。鼓手醒了，姑娘说：“你看，木柴堆成方木柴垛，只剩下一根树枝。老太婆今天晚上来，如果她问这树枝是怎么回事，你就用这树枝打她，说：‘这树枝是给你的，老巫婆。'”

老婆子来了，她说“：你看，这活多容易干呀，这树枝是给谁的？”

“给你的，老巫婆。”他回答说，拿起树枝打了她一下。但她装作什么也没感觉到的样子，冷笑着说：“明天早晨你把所有木柴堆成一个柴堆，点火把它烧了。”

拂晓时分他就起床，开始搬运木柴。可是，就他一个人怎么能把整个森林的木柴都弄到一块儿呢？工作没有进展。在危难之际，姑娘没有离开他：中午她给他带来菜肴，吃完饭后，他把头枕在她的怀里睡着了。一觉醒来，整个柴堆烈火熊熊地燃烧，火舌上冲云霄。“注意听我说，”姑娘说，“巫婆来时，会叫你做各种各样事情，不要害怕，她要你做什么，你都毫不畏惧地去做，她就丝毫伤害不了你；如果你害怕了，大火就会烧着你、吞噬你。到最后，你一切都做完了，就双手抓住她，把她抛入火海。”

姑娘走了，老婆子悄悄过来。“唉，真冷！”她说，“这儿有堆火烧着，暖和我这把老骨头，我觉得挺好。不过那儿有块木头没有燃烧，你去给我拿出来。做了这事，你就自由了，想去哪里，就可以去哪里。快去吧！”鼓手不假思索，跃进火海，火焰没伤害他，甚至没烧掉他一根毫毛。他把那块木头拿出来，放在地上。那木头一接触地面，马上变了：鼓手面前站着的，正是危难中给予他援手的美丽的姑娘，鼓手从她的一身流金焕彩的丝绸衣裳认出这就是他要找的公主。但是老婆子狞笑着说：“你以为你得到她了，其实你还没有得到她。”她正要朝公主扑过去，把她拖走，鼓手双手抓住老婆子，把她高高举起来，抛进熊熊燃烧的火焰，火焰吞没了她，火焰似乎为吞噬了一个巫婆而感到欢欣。

公主望着鼓手，见他是个英俊少年，想到他冒着生命危险来救她，便向他伸出手，说：“你为了我甘冒一切危险，我也愿意为你做一切事情。如果你答应对我忠实，我愿做你的妻子。我们有的是财富，我们拥有巫婆在这里所聚敛的，已足够了。”她把他领进屋里，那里有许多箱子柜子，装满珍宝。他们放着金银不拿，只带上宝石。她不愿在玻璃山上再逗留更长时间，鼓手对她说：“你和我一起坐在我的马鞍上，我们就会像鸟儿一样飞下山去。”

“我不喜欢旧马鞍，”她说，“我只要转动一下如意戒指，我们就到家了。”

“好，”鼓手回答说，“我们就发愿去城门口。”转眼间他们已在那里了。鼓手说：“我要先去我父母家里，告诉他们情况，你就在这原野上等我，我很快就回来。”

“啊，”公主说，“我请求你多加小心，到家后不要吻你父母的右面颊，否则你会忘记一切，我就得孤零零独自一人留在原野上了。”

“我怎么会忘记你呢？”鼓手说，许诺他很快就回来。

当他踏进父母的家，没有人知道他是谁，他的变化很大，因为他在玻璃山上度过的三天已是世上漫长的三年。他说了自己的身份，他的父母高兴得扑过去搂着他的脖子，他心里非常激动，忘了姑娘的嘱咐，亲吻了父母的双颊。他在父母的右脸颊印上了一个吻，有关公主的一切记忆就全都消失了。他把口袋里的东西都掏出来，将一大把非常大的宝石放在桌上。父母简直不知道该如何处置这些财富。于是父亲建造一座豪华宫殿，若干花园、草地，几座树林环绕宫殿周围，仿佛住在里面的是一位王侯。宫殿竣工了，母亲说：“我给你挑选了一个姑娘，三天后就举行婚礼。”父母想要的一切，儿子全都赞同。

可怜的公主在城门口站了很久，等待年轻人回去。到了晚上，她说：“他一定吻了他父母的右脸颊，把我忘了。”她心中充满悲伤，希望住在冷清的林中小屋，不愿再回到她父王的宫廷。她每天进城去，从他的家门口走过，他见到她几次，但已不认得她了。终于她听到人们说：“明天他要举行婚礼了。”她说：“我要试一试，看我能不能再次赢得他的心。”到了新婚首日晚会时，她转动她的如意戒指，说：“我要一件拥有太阳一样光辉的衣裳。”这衣裳立刻放在了她的面前，光芒耀眼，仿佛纯系太阳的光线织成的。宾客全都到齐了，她走进大厅。人人都对这件美丽的衣裳惊奇不已，而最感惊奇的则是新娘子。因为美丽的衣裳是她最大的快乐，她便走近那陌生女子身旁，问她是否愿意把这件衣裳卖给她。“用钱买不行，”她回答道，“不过，如果第一夜能让我待在新郎睡觉的房门口的话，我愿意卖。”新娘子无法抑制自己的欲望，便答应了，但她在酒里掺进安睡药水，新郎晚间喝了，睡得非常深沉。夜阑人静时，公主蹲在卧室门前，推开一点门缝，朝屋里说道：





鼓手，鼓手，你听我说，

难道你完全忘了我？

忘了玻璃山上你我坐在一起？

忘了我从巫婆手里救过你？

忘了你和我握手矢志忠贞不渝？

鼓手啊，鼓手，你听我说。





然而一切都无济于事，鼓手沉睡不醒，到了早晨，公主没能如愿以偿，只得离去。

第二天晚上，她转动如意戒指，说：“我要一件银白如月的衣裳。”她穿着柔美如月光的衣裳参加晚会，又激起新娘子的贪欲，允许公主在卧房门前度过第二个夜晚。夜深人静时她大声说道：





鼓手，鼓手，你听我说，

难道你完全忘了我？

忘了玻璃山上你我坐在一起？

忘了我从巫婆手里救过你？

忘了你和我握手矢志忠贞不渝？

鼓手啊，鼓手，你听我说。





可是鼓手喝了安睡药酒，睡得昏昏沉沉，无法唤醒。早晨，她又伤心地回到她的林中小屋。但鼓手府第中的人们听到了陌生姑娘的哀诉，对新郎谈起此事，他们还告诉他，他不可能听见什么，因为他们在他的酒里倒进安睡的药了。第三天晚上，公主转动如意戒指，说：“我要一件如同星光闪烁的衣裳。”当她穿着它在晚会上露面时，新娘子见它远比前两件衣裳更为绚丽华贵，激动极了，她说：“我无论如何要得到它。”和以前一样，姑娘要求获准在新郎卧室门前过夜。临睡前给新郎端来了酒，新郎不喝，把它泼在床后。屋子里全都安静下来了，他听见一个温柔的声音呼唤他：





鼓手，鼓手，你听我说，

难道你完全忘了我？

忘了玻璃山上你我坐在一起？

忘了我从巫婆手里救过你？

忘了你和我握手矢志忠贞不渝？

鼓手啊，鼓手，你听我说。





鼓手忽然恢复了记忆。“啊，”他喊道，“我怎能如此无情无义？原因是，我心里一高兴吻了我父母的右面颊，这一吻使我完全迷糊了。”他跳起来，拉着公主的手，把她领到他父母床前。“这才是我真正的新娘，”他说，“如果我娶另一个，就要铸成大错了。”父母听说了事情的全部经过，便同意了。于是大厅中又再点燃灯烛，召来鼓乐，邀集亲朋，极尽欢乐地举行真正的婚礼。那几件漂亮的衣裳归第一个新娘所有，作为对她的补偿，她也感到满意。





金钥匙


冬日里的一天，积雪很深，一个贫穷的男孩得出门驾雪橇去运木柴。他捡齐了柴火，搬到雪橇上，因他冻得厉害，想先烧一堆火暖和暖和再回家。扒开积雪，要清理出一块干净地面时，他发现了一把小金钥匙。他想，哪里有钥匙，哪里就会有和钥匙匹配的锁，就从地上挖下去，发现了一个小铁箱。“要是小钥匙能开这口箱子就好了！”他想，小箱子里面一定有珍贵的东西。他找锁眼，但小箱上没有。终于，他发现了一个小得几乎没法让人看见的小锁眼。他试了试，好运气，钥匙正合适。他转一下钥匙，现在我们得等他完全打开锁，掀开箱盖，才能知道箱子里面有什么奇妙的东西。





The Frog-King


In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the King's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the King's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.

Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. At this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. And as she thus lamented some one said to her,“What ails you, King's daughter? You weep so that even a stone would show pity.”She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a frog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water.“Ah! old water-splasher, is it you?”said she;“I am weeping for my golden ball, which has fallen into the well.”

“Be quiet, and do not weep,”answered the frog,“I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again?”

“Whatever you will have, dear frog,”said she—“My clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am wearing.”

The frog answered,“I do not care for your clothes, your pearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me and let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your little table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of your little cup, and sleep in your little bed—-if you will promise me this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up again.”

“Oh yes,”said she,“I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring me my ball back again.”She, however, thought,“How the silly frog does talk! All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and croak! He can be no companion to any human being!”

But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the water and sank down, and in a short while came swimmming up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and picked it up, and ran away with it.“Wait, wait,”said the frog.“Take me with you. I can't run as you can.”But what did it avail him to scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could? She did not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was forced to go back into his well again.

The next day when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate, something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and cried,“Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me.”She ran to see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog in front of it. Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat down to dinner again, and was quite frightened. The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently, and said,“My child, what are you so afraid of? Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to carry you away?”

“Ah, no,”replied she,“it is no giant, but a disgusting frog.”

“What does the frog want with you?”

“Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into the water. And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his water! And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me.”

In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,





“Princess! youngest princess!

Open the door for me!

Do you not know what you said to me

Yesterday by the cool waters of the well?

Princess, youngest princess!

Open the door for me!”





Then said the King,“That which you have promised must you perform. Go and let him in.”She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and cried,“Lift me up beside you.”She delayed, until at last the King commanded her to do it. Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to be on the table, and when he was on the table he said,“Now, push your little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together.”She did this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly. The frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked her. At length he said,“I have eaten and am satisfied; now I am tired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep.”

The King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her pretty, clean little bed. But the King grew angry and said,“He who helped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be despised by you.”So she took hold of the frog with two fingers, carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner. But when she was in bed he crept to her and said,“I am tired, I want to sleep as well as you, lift me up or I will tell your father.”At this she was terribly angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall.“Now, you will be quiet, odious frog,”said she.

But when he fell down he was no frog but a King's son with kind and beautiful eyes. He by her father's will was now her dear companion and husband. Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom. Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden chains, and behind stood the young King's servant, faithful Henry. Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart, lest it should burst with grief and sadness. The carriage was to conduct the young King into his Kingdom. Faithful Henry helped them both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because of this deliverance. And when they had driven a part of the way the King's son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken. So he turned round and cried,“Henry, the carriage is breaking.”

“No, master, it is not the carriage. It is a band from my heart, which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned in the well.”Again and once again while they were on their way something cracked, and each time the King's son thought the carriage was breaking;but it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy.





Our Lady's Child


Hard by a great forest dwelt a wood-cutter with his wife, who had an only child, a little girl three years old. They were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to get food for her. One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him,“I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus. You are poor and needy, bring your child to me, I will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her.”The wood-cutter obeyed, brought his child, and gave her to the Virgin Mary, who took her up to heaven with her. There the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her. And when she was fourteen years of age, the Virgin Mary called her one day and said,“Dear child, I am about to make a long journey, so take into your keeping the keys of the thirteen doors of heaven. Twelve of these you may open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden you. Take care not to open it, or you will be unhappy.”The girl promised to be obedient, and when the Virgin Mary was gone, she began to examine the dwellings of the kingdom of heaven. Each day she opened one of them, until she had made the round of the twelve. In each of them sat one of the Apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour, and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her. Then the forbidden door alone remained, and she felt a great desire to know what could be hidden behind it, and said to the angels,“I will not open it entirely, and I will not go inside, but I will unlock it so that we can just see a little through the opening.”

“Oh no,”said the little angels,“that would be a sin. The Virgin Mary has forbidden it, and it might easily cause your unhappiness.”Then she was silent, but the desire in her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and let her have no rest. And once when the angels had all gone out, she thought,“Now I am quite alone, and I could peep in. If I do, no one will ever know.”She sought out the key, and when she had got it in her hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she turned it round as well. Then the door sprang open, and she saw there the Trinity sitting in fire and splendour. She stayed there awhile, and looked at everything in amazement; then she touched the light a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden. Immediately a great fear fell on her. She shut the door violently, and ran away. But her terror would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.

It was not long before the Virgin Mary came back from her journey. She called the girl before her, and asked to have the keys of heaven back. When the maiden gave her the bunch, the Virgin looked into her eyes and said:“Have you not opened the thirteenth door also?”

“No,”she replied. Then she laid her hand on the girl's heart, and felt how it beat and beat, and saw right well that she had disobeyed her order and had opened the door. Then she said once again,“Are you certain that you have not done it?”

“Yes,”said the girl, for the second time. Then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time,“Have you not done it?”

“No,”said the girl for the third time.

Then said the Virgin Mary,“You have not obeyed me, and besides that you have lied, you are no longer worthy to be in heaven.”

Then the girl fell into a deep sleep, and when she awoke she lay on the earth below, and in the midst of a wilderness. She wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound. She sprang up and wanted to run away, but whithersoever she turned herself, she was continually held back by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break. In the desert, in which she was imprisoned, there stood an old hollow tree, and this had to be her dwelling-place. Into this she crept when night came, and here she slept. Here, too, she found a shelter from storm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how the angels had played with her. Roots and wild berries were her only food, and for these she sought as far as she could go. In the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the hole. The nuts were her food in winter, and when snow and ice came, she crept amongst the leaves like a poor little animal that she might not freeze. Before long her clothes were all torn, and one bit of them after another fell off her. As soon, however, as the sun shone warm again, she went out and sat in front of the tree, and her long hair covered her on all sides like a mantle. Thus she sat year after year, and felt the pain and the misery of the world.

One day, when the trees were once more clothed in fresh green, the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and followed a roe, and as it had fled into the thicket which shut in this part of the forest, he got off his horse, tore the bushes asunder, and cut himself a path with his sword. When he had at last forced his way through, he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting under the tree; and she sat there and was entirely covered with her golden hair down to her very feet. He stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he spoke to her and said,“Who are you? Why are you sitting here in the wilderness?”But she gave no answer, for she could not open her mouth. The King continued,“Will you go with me to my castle?”Then she just nodded her head a little. The King took her in his arms, carried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments, and gave her all things in abundance. Although she could not speak, she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her with all his heart, and it was not long before he married her.

After a year or so had passed, the Queen brought a son into the world. Thereupon the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night when she lay in her bed alone, and said,“If you will tell the truth and confess that you did unlock the forbidden door, I will open your mouth and give you back your speech, but if you persever in your sin, and deniest obstinately, I will take your new-born child away with me.”Then the queen was permitted to answer, but she remained hard, and said,“No, I did not open the forbidden door”; and the Virgin Mary took the new-born child from her arms, and vanished with it. Next morning when the child was not to be found, it was whispered among the people that the Queen was a man-eater, and had put her own child to death. She heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary, but the King would not believe it, for he loved her so much.

When a year had gone by the Queen again bore a son, and in the night the Virgin Mary again came to her, and said,“If you will confess that you opened the forbidden door, I will give you your child back and untie your tongue; but if you continue in sin and deny it, I will take away with me this new child also.”Then the Queen again said,“No, I did not open the forbidden door;”and the Virgin took the child out of her arms, and away with her to heaven. Next morning, when this child also had disappeared, the people declared quite loudly that the Queen had devoured it, and the King's councillors demanded that she should be brought to justice. The King, however, loved her so dearly that he would not believe it, and commanded the councillors under pain of death not to say any more about it.

The following year the Queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter, and for the third time the Virgin Mary appeared to her in the night and said,“Follow me.”She took the Queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her there her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing with the ball of the world. When the Queen rejoiced thereat, the Virgin Mary said,“Is your heart not yet softened? If you will own that you opened the forbidden door, I will give you back your two little sons.”But for the third time the Queen answered,“No, I did not open the forbidden door.”Then the Virgin let her sink down to earth once more, and took from her likewise her third child.

Next morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried loudly,“The Queen is a man-eater. She must be judged,”and the King was no longer able to restrain his councillors. Thereupon a trial was held, and as she could not answer, and defend herself, she was condemned to be burnt at the stake. The wood was got together, and when she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn round about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by repentance, and she thought,“If I could but confess before my death that I opened the door.”Then her voice came back to her, and she cried out loudly,“Yes, Mary, I did it;”and straight-way rain fell from the sky and extinguished the flames of fire, and a light broke forth above her, and the Virgin Mary descended with the two little sons by her side, and the new-born daughter in her arms. She spoke kindly to her, and said,“He who repents his sin and acknowledges it, is forgiven.”Then she gave her the three children, untied her tongue, and granted her happiness for her whole life.





Faithful John


There was once on a time an old king who was ill, and thought to himself,“I am lying on what must be my death-bed.”Then said he,“Tell Faithful John to come to me.”Faithful John was his favourite servant, and was so called, because he had for his whole life long been so true to him. When therefore he came beside the bed, the King said to him,“Most faithful John, I feel my end approaching, and have no anxiety except about my son. He is still of tender age, and cannot always know how to guide himself. If you do not promise me to teach him everything that he ought to know, and to be his foster-father, I cannot close my eyes in peace.”Then answered Faithful John,“I will not forsake him, and will serve him with fidelity, even if it should cost me my life.”At this, the old King said,“Now I die in comfort and peace.”Then he added,“After my death, you shall show him the whole castle: all the chambers, halls, and vaults, and all the treasures which lie therein, but the last chamber in the long gallery, in which is the picture of the princess of the Golden Dwelling, shall you not show. If he sees that picture, he will fall violently in love with her, and will drop down in a swoon, and go through great danger for her sake, therefore you must protect him from that.”And when Faithful John had once more given his promise to the old King about this, the King said no more, but laid his head on his pillow, and died.

When the old King had been carried to his grave, Faithful John told the young King all that he had promised his father on his deathbed, and said,“This will I assuredly keep, and will be faithful to you as I have been faithful to him, even if it should cost me my life.”When the mourning was over, Faithful John said to him,“It is now time that you shouldst see your inheritance. I will show you your father's palace.”Then he took him about everywhere, up and down, and let him see all the riches, and the magnificent apartments, only there was one room which he did not open, that in which hung the dangerous picture. The picture, however, was so placed that when the door was opened you looked straight on it, and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to breathe and live, and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful in the whole world. The young King noticed, however, that Faithful John always walked past this one door, and said,“Why do you never open this one for me?”

“There is something within it,”he replied,“which would terrify you.”

But the King answered,“I have seen all the palace, and I want to know what is in this room also,”and he went and tried to break open the door by force.

Then Faithful John held him back and said,“I promised your father before his death that you should not see that which is in this chamber, it might bring the greatest misfortune on you and on me.”

“Ah, no,”replied the young King,“if I do not go in, it will be my certain destruction. I should have no rest day or night until I had seen it with my own eyes. I shall not leave the place now until you have unlocked the door.”

Then Faithful John saw that there was no help for it now, and with a heavy heart and many sighs, sought out the key from the great bunch. When he had opened the door, he went in first, and thought by standing before him he could hide the portrait so that the King should not see it in front of him, but what good was this? The King stood on tip-toe and saw it over his shoulder. And when he saw the portrait of the maiden, which was so magnificent and shone with gold and precious stones, he fell fainting to the ground. Faithful John took him up, carried him to his bed, and sorrowfully thought,“The misfortune has befallen us, Lord God, what will be the end of it?”Then he strengthened him with wine, until he came to himself again. The first words the King said were,“Ah, the beautiful portrait! whose it it?”

“That is the princess of the Golden Dwelling,”answered Faithful John.

Then the King continued,“My love for her is so great, that if all the leaves on all the trees were tongues, they could not declare it. I will give my life to win her. You are my most Faithful John, you must help me.”

The faithful servant considered within himself for a long time how to set about the matter, for it was difficult even to obtain a sight of the King's daughter. At length he thought of a way, and said to the King,“Everything which she has about her is of gold—-tables, chairs, dishes, glasses, bowls, and household furniture. Among your treasures are five tons of gold;let one of the goldsmiths of the kingdom fashion these into all manner of vessels and utensils, into all kinds of birds, wild beasts and strange animals, such as may please her, and we will go there with them and try our luck.”

The King ordered all the goldsmiths to be brought to him, and they had to work night and day until at last the most splendid things were prepared. When everything was stowed on board a ship, Faithful John put on the dress of a merchant, and the King was forced to do the same in order to make himself quite unrecognizable. Then they sailed across the sea, and sailed on until they came to the town wherein dwelt the princess of the Golden Dwelling.

Faithful John bade the King stay behind on the ship, and wait for him.“Perhaps I shall bring the princess with me,”said he,“therefore see that everything is in order; have the golden vessels set out and the whole ship decorated.”Then he gathered together in his apron all kinds of gold things, went on shore and walked straight to the royal palace. When he entered the courtyard of the palace, a beautiful girl was standing there by the well with two golden buckets in her hand, drawing water with them. And when she was just turning round to carry away the sparkling water she saw the stranger, and asked who he was. So he answered,“I am a merchant,”and opened his apron, and let her look in. Then she cried,“Oh, what beautiful gold things!”and put her pails down and looked at the golden wares one after the other. Then said the girl,“The princess must see these, she has such great pleasure in golden things, that she will buy all you have.”She took him by the hand and led him upstairs, for she was the waiting-maid. When the King's daughter saw the wares, she was quite delighted and said,“They are so beautifully worked, that I will buy them all from you.”But Faithful John said,“I am only the servant of a rich merchant. The things I have here are not to be compared with those my master has in his ship. They are the most beautiful and valuable things that have ever been made in gold.”When she wanted to have everything brought up to her there, he said,“There are so many of them that it would take a great many days to do that, and so many rooms would be required to exhibit them, that your house is not big enough.”Then her curiosity and longing were still more excited, until at last she said,“Conduct me to the ship, I will go there myself, and behold the treasures of your master.”

At this Faithful John was quite delighted, and led her to the ship, and when the King saw her, he perceived that her beauty was even greater than the picture had represented it to be, and thought no other than that his heart would burst in twain. Then she boarded the ship, and the King led her within. Faithful John, however, remained with the helmsman, and ordered the ship to be pushed off, saying,“Set all sail, till it fly like a bird in the air.”Within, however, the King showed her the golden vessels, every one of them, also the wild beasts and strange animals. Many hours went by whilst she was seeing everything, and in her delight she did not observe that the ship was sailing away. After she had looked at the last,she thanked the merchant and wanted to go home, but when she came to the side of the ship, she saw that it was on the high seas far from land, and hurrying onwards with all sail set.“Ah,”cried she in her alarm,“I am betrayed! I am carried away and have fallen into the power of a merchant—-I would rather die!”The King, however, seized her hand, and said,“I am not a merchant. I am a king, and of no meaner origin than you are, and if I have carried you away with subtlety, that has come to pass because of my exceeding great love for you. The first time that I looked on your portrait, I fell fainting to the ground.”When the princess of the Golden Dwelling heard this, she was comforted, and her heart was drawn to him, so that she willingly consented to be his wife.

It so happened, while they were sailing onwards over the deep sea, that Faithful John, who was sitting on the fore part of the vessel, making music, saw three ravens in the air, which came flying towards them. On this he stopped playing and listened to what they were saying to each other, for that he well understood. One cried,“Oh, there he is carrying home the princess of the Golden Dwelling.”

“Yes,”replied the second,“but he has not got her yet.”

Said the third,“But he has got her, she is sitting beside him in the ship.”

Then the first began again, and cried,“What good will that do him? When they reach land a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him, and the prince will want to mount it, but if he does that, it will run away with him, and rise up into the air with him, and he will never see his maiden more.”

Spoke the second,“But is there no escape?”

“Oh, yes, if someone else mounts it swiftly, and takes out the pistol which he will find in its holster, and shoots the horse dead, the young King is saved. But who knows that? And whosoever does know it, and tells it to him, will be turned to stone from the toe to the knee.”

Then said the second,“I know more than that; even if the horse be killed, the young King will still not keep his bride. When they go into the castle together, a wrought bridal garment will be lying there in a dish, and looking as if it were woven of gold and silver; it is, however, nothing but sulphur and pitch, and if he put it on, it will burn him to the very bone and marrow.”

Said the third,“Is there no escape at all?”

“Oh, yes,”replied the second,“if any one with gloves on seizes the garment and throws it into the fire and burns it, the young King will be saved.“But what good will that do? Whosoever knows it and tells it to him, half his body will become stone from the knee to the heart.”

Then said the third,“I know still more; even if the bridal garment be burnt, the young King will still not have his bride. After the wedding, when the dancing begins and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead, and if some one does not lift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and spit them out again, she will die. But if any one who knows that were to declare it, he would become stone from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.”

When the ravens had spoken of this together, they flew onwards, and Faithful John had well understood everything, but from that time forth he became quiet and sad, for if he concealed what he had heard from his master, the latter would be unfortunate, and if he disclosed it to him, he himself must sacrifice his life. At length, however, he said to himself,“I will save my master, even if it bring destruction on myself.”

When therefore they came to shore, all happened as had been foretold by the ravens, and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang forward.“Good,”said the King,“he shall carry me to my palace,”and was about to mount it when Faithful John got before him, jumped quickly on it, drew the pistol out of the holster, and shot the horse. Then the other attendants of the King, who were not very fond of Faithful John, cried,“How shameful to kill the beautiful animal, that was to have carried the King to his palace.”But the King said,“Hold your peace and leave him alone, he is my most faithful John, who knows what good may come of this!”

They went into the palace, and in the hall there stood a dish, and therein lay the bridal garment looking no otherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver. The young King went towards it and was about to take hold of it, but Faithful John pushed him away, seized it with gloves on, carried it quickly to the fire and burnt it. The other attendants again began to murmur, and said,“Behold, now he is even burning the King's bridal garment!”But the young King said,“Who knows what good he may have done, leave him alone, he is my most faithful John.”

And now the wedding was solemnized: the dance began, and the bride also took part in it; then Faithful John was watchful and looked into her face, and suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground, as if she were dead. On this he ran hastily to her, lifted her up and bore her into a chamber—-then he laid her down, and knelt and sucked the three drops of blood from her right breast, and spat them out. Immediately she breathed again and recovered herself, but the young King had seen this, and being ignorant why Faithful John had done it, was angry and cried,“Throw him into a dungeon.”

Next morning Faithful John was condemned, and led to the gallows, and when he stood on high, and was about to be executed, he said,“Every one who has to die is permitted before his end to make one last speech;may I too claim the right?”

“Yes,”answered the King,“it shall be granted unto you.”

Then said Faithful John,“I am unjustly condemned, and have always been true to you,”and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the ravens when on the sea, and how he had been obliged to do all these things in order to save his master. Then cried the King,“Oh, my most Faithful John. Pardon, pardon—-bring him down.”But as Faithful John spoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a stone.

Thereupon the King and the Queen suffered great anguish, and the King said,“Ah, how ill I have requited great fidelity!”and ordered the stone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed. And as often as he looked on it he wept and said,“Ah, if I could bring you to life again, my most faithful John.”

Some time passed and the Queen bore twins, two sons who grew fast and were her delight. Once when the Queen was at church and the the father was sitting with his two shildren playing beside him, he looked at the stone figure, sighed, and full of grief again he said,“Ah, if I could but bring you to life again, my most faithful John.”

Then the stone began to speak and said,“You can bring me to life again if you will use for that purpose what is dearest to you.”

Then cried the King,“I will give everything I have in the world for you.”

The stone continued,“If you will cut off the heads of your two children with your own hand, and sprinkle me with their blood, I shall be restored to life.”

The King was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his dearest children, but he thought of faithful John's great fidelity, and how he had died for him, drew his sword, and with his own hand cut off the children's heads. And when he had smeared the stone with their blood, life returned to it, and Faithful John stood once more safe and healthy before him. He said to the King,“Your truth shall not go unrewarded,”and took the heads of the children, put them on again, and rubbed the wounds with their blood, on which they became whole again immediately, and jumped about, and went on playing as if nothing had happened. Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming he hid Faithful John and the two children in a great cupboard. When she entered, he said to her,“Have you been praying in the church?”

“Yes,”answered she,“but I have constantly been thinking of Faithful John and what misfortune has befallen him through us.”

Then said he,“Dear wife, we can give him his life again, but it will cost us our two little sons, whom we must sacrifice.”

The Queen turned pale, and her heart was full of terror, but she said,“We owe it to him, for his great fidelity.”

Then the King was rejoiced that she thought as he had thought, and went and opened the cupboard, and brought forth Faithful John and the children, and said,“God be praised, he is delivered, and we have our little sons again also,”and told her how everything had occurred. Then they dwelt together in much happiness until their death.





Rapunzel


There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked,“What ails you, dear wife?”

“Ah,”she replied,“if I can't cut some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.”

The man, who loved her, thought,“Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.”At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greadily. It tasted so good to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.

“How can you dare,”said she with angry look,“to descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!”

“Ah,”answered he,“let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.”Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him,“If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.”The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.

When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,





“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair to me.”





Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the King's son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The King's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,





“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair.”





Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.“If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my fortune,”said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,





“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair.”





Immediately the hair fell down and the King's son climbed up.

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the King's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought,“He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does;”and she said yes,and laid her hand in his. She said,“I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.”They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her,“Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young King's son—-he is with me in a moment.”

“Ah! you wicked child,”cried the enchantress.“What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me.”In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.

On the same day, that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the King's son came and cried,





“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,

Let down your hair,”





she let the hair down. The King's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.“Aha!”she cried mockingly,“You would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.”The King's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell, pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.





The Three Snake-Leaves


There was once on a time a poor man, who could no longer support his only son. Then said the son,“Dear father, things go so badly with us that I am a burden to you. I would rather go away and see how I can earn my bread.”So the father gave him his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him. At this time the King of a mighty empire was at war, and the youth took service with him, and went out to fight. And when he came before the enemy, there was a battle, and great danger, and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides, and when the leader also was killed, those left were about to take flight, but the youth stepped forth, spoke boldly to them, and cried,“We will not let our fatherland be ruined!”Then the others followed him, and he pressed on and conquered the enemy. When the King heard that he owed the victory to him alone, he raised him above all the others, gave him great treasures, and made him the first in the kingdom.

The King had a daughter who was very beautiful, but she was also very strange. She had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died first.“If he loves me with all his heart,”said she,“of what use will life be to him afterwards?”On her side she would do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave with him. This strange oath had up to this time frightened away all wooers, but the youth became so charmed with her beauty that he cared for nothing, but asked her father for her.“But do you know what you must promise?”said the King.

“I must be buried with her,”he replied,“if I outlive her, but my love is so great that I do not mind the danger.”Then the King consented, and the wedding was solemnized with great splendour.

They lived now for a while happy and contented with each other, and then it befell that the young Queen was attacked by a severe illness, and no physician could save her. And as she lay there dead, the young King remembered what he had been obliged to promise, and was horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave, but there was no escape. The King had placed sentries at all the gates, and it was not possible to avoid his fate. As the day came when the corpse was to be buried, he was taken down with it into the royal vault and then the door was shut and bolted.

Near the coffin stood a table on which were four candles, four loaves of bread, and four bottles of wine, and when this provision came to an end, he would have to die of hunger. And now he sat there full of pain and grief, ate every day only a little piece of bread, drank only a mouthful of wine, and nevertheless saw death daily drawing nearer. Whilst he thus gazed before him, he saw a snake creep out of a corner of the vault and approach the dead body. And as he thought it came to gnaw at it, he drew his sword and said,“As long as I live, you shall not touch her,”and hewed the snake in three pieces. After a time a second snake crept out of the hole, and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back, but soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth. Then it took the three pieces of the snake, laid them together, as they fitted, and placed one of the leaves on each wound. Immediately the severed parts joined themselves together, the snake moved, and became alive again, and both of them hastened away together. The leaves were left lying on the ground, and a desire came into the mind of the unhappy man who had been watching all this, to know if the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the snake to life again, could not likewise be of service to a human being. So he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his dead wife, and the two others on her eyes. And hardly had he done this than the blood stirred in her veins, rose into her pale face, and coloured it again. Then she drew breath, opened her eyes, and said,“Ah, God, where am I?”

“You are with me, dear wife,”he answered, and told her how everything had happened, and how he had brought her back again to life. Then he gave her some wine and bread, and when she had regained her strength, he raised her up and they went to the door and knocked, and called so loudly that the sentries heard it, and told the King. The King came down himself and opened the door, and there he found both strong and well, and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over. The young King, however, took the three snake-leaves with him, gave them to a servant and said,“Keep them for me carefully, and carry them constantly about you; who knows in what trouble they may yet be of service to us!”

But a change had taken place in his wife; after she had been restored to life, it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone out of her heart. After some time, when he wanted to make a voyage over the sea, to visit his old father, and they had gone on board a ship, she forgot the great love and fidelity which he had shown her, and which had been the means of rescuing her from death, and conceived a wicked inclination for the skipper. And once when the young King lay there asleep, she called in the skipper and seized the sleeper by the head, and the skipper took him by the feet, and thus they threw him down into the sea. When the shameful deed was done, she said,“Now let us return home, and say that he died on the way. I will extol and praise you so to my father that he will marry me to you, and make you the heir to his crown.”But the faithful servant who had seen all that they did, unseen by them, unfastened a little boat from the ship, got into it, sailed after his master, and let the traitors go on their way. He fished up the dead body, and by the help of the three snake leaves which he carried about with him, and laid on the eyes and mouth, he fortunately brought the young King back to life.

They both rowed with all their strength day and night, and their little boat sailed so swiftly that they reached the old King before the others. He was astonished when he saw them come alone, and asked what had happened to them. When he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he said,“I cannot believe that she has behaved so ill, but the truth will soon come to light,”and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one. Soon afterwards the great ship came sailing in, and the godless woman appeared before her father with a troubled countenance. He said,“Why do you come back alone? Where is your husband?”

“Ah, dear father,”she replied,“I come home again in great grief;during the voyage, my husband became suddenly ill and died, and if the good skipper had not given me his help, it would have gone ill with me. He was present at his death, and can tell you all.”The King said,“I will make the dead alive again,”and opened the chamber, and bade the two come out. When the woman saw her husband, she was thunderstruck, and fell on her knees and begged for mercy. The King said,“There is no mercy. He was ready to die with you and restored you to life again, but you have murdered him in his sleep, and shall receive the reward that you deserve.”Then she was placed with her accomplice in a ship which had been pierced with holes, and sent out to sea, where they soon sank amid the waves.





Cinderella


The wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said,“Dear child, be good and pious, and then the good God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you.”Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed. Every day the maiden went out to her mother's grave, and wept, and she remained pious and good. When winter came the snow spread a white sheet over the grave, and by the time the spring sun had drawn it off again, the man had taken another wife.

The woman had brought with her into the house two daughters, who were beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart. Now began a bad time for the poor step-child.“Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlour with us?”they said.“He who wants to eat bread must earn it; out with the kitchen-wench.”They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old grey bedgown on her, and gave her wooden shoes.“Just look at the proud princess, how decked out she is!”they cried, and laughed, and led her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash. Besides this, the sisters did her every imaginable injury — they mocked her and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was forced to sit and pick them out again. In the evening when she had worked till she was weary she had no bed to go to, but had to sleep by the hearth in the cinders. And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella.

It happened that the father was once going to the fair, and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them.“Beautiful dresses,”said one,“Pearls and jewels,”said the second.“And you, Cinderella,”said he,“what will you have?”

“Father, break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home.”So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for his two step-daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the branch and took it with him. When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things which they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the branch from the hazel-bush. Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave and planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on it and watered it. And it grew, however, and became a handsome tree. Thrice a day Cinderella went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little white bird always came on the tree, and if Cinderella expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her what she had wished for.

It happened, however, that the King appointed a festival which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose himself a bride. When the two step-sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were delighted, called Cinderella and said,“Comb our hair for us, brush our shoes and fasten our buckles, for we are going to the festival at the King's palace.”Cinderella obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go with them to the dance, and begged her step-mother to allow her to do so.“You go, Cinderella!”said she;“You are dusty and dirty and would go to the festival? You have no clothes and shoes, and yet would dance!”As, however, Cinderella went on asking, the step-mother at last said,“I have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you, if you have picked them out again in two hours, you shall go with us.”The maiden went through the back-door into the garden, and called,“You tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to pick





“The good into the pot,

The bad into the crop.”





Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at last all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. And the pigeons nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the rest began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good grains into the dish. Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished, and all flew out again. Then the girl took the dish to her step-mother, and was glad, and believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the festival. But the step-mother said,“No, Cinderella, you have no clothes and you can not dance; you wouldst only be laughed at.”And as Cinderella wept at this, the step-mother said,“If you can pick two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you shall go with us.”And she thought to herself,“That she most certainly cannot do.”When the step-mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the ashes, the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and cried, You tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds under heaven, come and help me to pick





“The good into the pot,

The bad into the crop.”





Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at length all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an hour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again. Then the maiden carried the dishes to the step-mother and was delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the festival. But the step-mother said,“All this will not help you; you can not go with us, for you have no clothes and can not dance; we should be ashamed of you!”On this she turned her back on Cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters.

As no one was now at home, Cinderella went to her mother's grave beneath the hazel-tree, and cried,





“Shiver and quiver, little tree,

Silver and gold throw down over me.”





Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She put on the dress with all speed, and went to the festival. Her step-sisters and the step-mother however did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought of Cinderella, and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes. The prince went to meet her, took her by the hand and danced with her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never let loose of her hand, and if any one else came to invite her, he said,“This is my partner.”

She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home.But the King's son said,“I will go with you and bear you company,”for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged. She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon-house. The King's son waited until her father came, and then he told him that the stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house. The old man thought,“Can it be Cinderella?”and they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it. And when they got home Cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantle-piece, for Cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house and had run to the little hazel-tree, and there she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again, and then she had placed herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes in her grey gown.

Next day when the festival began afresh, and her parents and the step-sisters had gone once more, Cinderella went to the hazel-tree and said—





“Shiver and quiver, my little tree,

Silver and gold throw down over me.”





Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day. And when Cinderella appeared at the festival in this dress, every one was astonished at her beauty. The King's son had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her. When others came and invited her, he said,“She is my partner.”When evening came she wished to leave, and the King's son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went. But she sprang away from him, and into the garden behind the house. Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears.She clambered so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the King's son did not know where she was gone. He waited until her father came, and said to him,“The stranger-maiden has escaped from me, and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree.”The father thought,“Can it be Cinderella?”and had an axe brought and cut the tree down, but no one was on it. And when they got into the kitchen, Cinderella lay there among the ashes, as usual, for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and put on her grey gown.

On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away, Cinderella went once more to her mother's grave and said to the little tree—





“Shiver and quiver, my little tree,

Silver and gold throw down over me.”





And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were golden. And when she went to the festival in the dress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment. The King's son danced with her only, and if any one invited her to dance, he said,“She is my partner.”

When evening came, Cinderella wished to leave, and the King's son was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her. The King's son had, however, used a strategem, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maiden's left slipper remained sticking. The King's son picked it up, and it was small and dainty, and all golden. Next morning, he went with it to the father, and said to him,“No one shall be my wife but she whose foot this golden slipper fits.”Then were the two sisters glad, for they had pretty feet. The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by. But she could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a knife and said,“Cut the toe off; when you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot.”The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the King's son. Then he took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. They were, however, obliged to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree, sat the two pigeons and cried,





“Turn and peep, turn and peep,

There's blood within the shoe,

The shoe it is too small for her,

The true bride waits for you.”





Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was streaming from it. He turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, and said she was not the true one, and that the other sister was to put the shoe on. Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was too large. So her mother gave her a knife and said,“Cut a bit off your heel; when you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot.”The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the King's son. He took her on his horse as his bride, and rode away with her, but when they passed by the hazel-tree, two little pigeons sat on it and cried,





“Turn and peep, turn and peep,

There's blood within the shoe

The shoe it is too small for her,

The true bride waits for you.”





He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking quite red. Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again.“This also is not the right one,”said he,“have you no other daughter?”

“No,”said the man,“There is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the bride.”The King's son said he was to send her up to him; but the mother answered,“Oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself!”He absolutely insisted on it, and Cinderella had to be called. She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the King's son, who gave her the golden shoe. Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove. And when she rose up and the King's son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him and cried,“That is the true bride!”The step-mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with rage; he, however, took Cinderella on his horse and rode away with her. As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried—





“Turn and peep, turn and peep,

No blood is in the shoe,

The shoe is not too small for her,

The true bride rides with you,”





and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed themselves on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there.

When the wedding with the King's son had to be celebrated, the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favour with Cinderella and share her good fortune. When the betrothed couple went to church, the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye of each of them. Afterwards as they came back, the elder was at the left, and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye of each. And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they lived.





Mother Holle


There was once a widow who had two daughters—-one of whom was pretty and industrious, whilst the other was ugly and idle. But she was much fonder of the ugly and idle one, because she was her own daughter;and the other, who was a step-daughter, was obliged to do all the work, and be the Cinderella of the house. Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well, in the highway, and spin and spin till her fingers bled.

Now it happened that one day the shuttle was marked with her blood, so she dipped it in the well, to wash the mark off; but it dropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom. She began to weep, and ran to her step-mother and told her of the mishap. But she scolded her sharply, and was so merciless as to say,“Since you have let the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again.”

So the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do; and in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the shuttle. She lost her senses; and when she awoke and came to herself again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was shining and many thousands of flowers were growing. Across this meadow she went, and at last came to a baker's oven full of bread, and the bread cried out,“Oh, take me out! take me out! or I shall burn; I have been baked a long time!”So she went up to it, and took out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel. After that she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples, which called out to her,“Oh, shake me! shake me! we apples are all ripe!”So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain, and went on shaking till they were all down, and when she had gathered them into a heap, she went on her way. At last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman peeped; but she had such large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was about to run away. But the old woman called out to her,“What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do all the work in the house properly, you shall be the better for it. Only you must take care to make my bed well, and shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly—-for then there is snow on the earth. I am Mother Holle.”

As the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service. She attended to everything to the satisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes. So she had a pleasant life with her; never an angry word; and to eat she had boiled or roast meat every day.

She stayed some time with Mother Holle, and then she became sad. At first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found at length that it was home-sickness: although she was many thousand times better off here than at home, still she had a longing to be there. At last she said to the old woman,“I have a longing for home; and however well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go up again to my own people.”Mother Holle said,“I am pleased that you long for your home again, and as you have served me so truly, I myself will take you up again.”Thereupon she took her by the hand, and led her to a large door. The door was opened, and just as the maiden was standing beneath the doorway, a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the gold remained sticking to her, so that she was completely covered over with it.

“You shall have that because you have been so industrious,”said Mother Holle, and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle which she had let fall into the well. Thereupon the door closed, and the maiden found herself up above upon the earth, not far from her mother's house.

And as she went into the yard the cock was standing by the well-side, and cried—





“Cock-a-doodle-doo!

Your golden girl's come back to you!”





So she went in to her mother, and as she arrived thus covered with gold, she was well received, both by her and her sister. The girl told all that had happened to her; and as soon as the mother heard how she had come by so much wealth, she was very anxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter. She had to seat herself by the well and spin; and in order that her shuttle might be stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a thorn bush and pricked her finger. Then she threw her shuttle into the well, and jumped in after it. She came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and walked along the very same path. When she got to the oven the bread again cried,“Oh, take me out! take me out! or I shall burn; I have been baked a long time!”But the lazy thing answered,“As if I had any wish to make myself dirty?”and on she went. Soon she came to the apple-tree, which cried,“Oh, shake me! shake me! we apples are all ripe!”But she answered,“I like that! one of you might fall on my head,”and so went on.

When she came to Mother Holle's house she was not afraid, for she had already heard of her big teeth, and she hired herself to her immediately.

The first day she forced herself to work diligently, and obeyed Mother Holle when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking of all the gold that she would give her. But on the second day she began to be lazy, and on the third day still more so, and then she would not get up in the morning at all. Neither did she make Mother Holle's bed as she ought, and did not shake it so as to make the feathers fly up. Mother Holle was soon tired of this, and gave her notice to leave. The lazy girl was willing enough to go, and thought that now the golden rain would come. Mother Holle led her also to the great door; but while she was standing beneath it, instead of the gold a big kettleful of pitch was emptied over her.“That is the reward for your service,”said Mother Holle, and shut the door.

So the lazy girl went home; but she was quite covered with pitch, and the cock by the well-side, as soon as he saw her, cried out—





“Cock-a-doodle-doo!

Your pitchy girl's come back to you!”





But the pitch stuck fast to her, and could not be got off as long as she lived.





The Seven Ravens


There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had no daughter, however much he wished for one. At length his wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into the world it was a girl. The joy was great, but the child was sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness. The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism. The other six went with him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug fell into the well. There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home. As they still did not return, the father grew impatient, and said,“They have certainly forgotten it for some game, the wicked boys!”He became afraid that the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his anger cried,“I wish the boys were all turned into ravens.”Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head in the air, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.

The parents could not recall the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful. For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were careful not to mention them before her, but one day she accidentally heard some people saying of herself,“that the girl was certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers.”Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them? The parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of Heaven, and that her birth had only been the innocent cause. But the maiden took it to heart daily, and thought she must deliver her brothers. She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to trace out her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might. She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.

And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world. Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and devoured little children. Hastily she ran away, and ran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious, and when it saw the child, it said,“I smell, I smell the flesh of men.”On this she ran swiftly away, and came to the stars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its own particular little chair. But the morning star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said,“If you have not that drumstick you can not open the Glass mountain, and in the Glass mountain are your brothers.”

The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and went onwards again until she came to the Glass mountain. The door was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick; but when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good star's present. What was she now to do? She wished to rescue her brothers, and had no key to the Glass mountain. The good sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in opening it. When she had gone inside, a little dwarf came to meet her, who said,“My child, what are you looking for?”

“I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens,”she replied. The dwarf said,“The lord ravens are not at home, but if you will wait here until they come, step in.”Thereupon the little dwarf carried the ravens' dinner in, on seven little plates, and in seven little glasses, and the little sister ate a morsel from each plate, and from each little glass she took a sip, but in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away with her.

Suddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air, and then the little dwarf said,“Now the lord ravens are flying home.”Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other,“Who has eaten something from my plate? Who has drunk out of my little glass? It was a human mouth.”And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against his mouth. Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother, and said,“God grant that our sister may be here, and then we shall be free.”When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish, she came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their human form again. And they embraced and kissed each other, and went joyfully home.





Little Red-Cap


Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called“Little Red-Cap.”

One day her mother said to her,“Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, ‘Goodmorning, ' and don't peep into every corner before you do it.”

“I will take great care,”said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.

“Good-day, Little Red-Cap,”said he.

“Thank you kindly, wolf.”

“Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?”

“To my grandmother's.”

“What have you got in your apron?”

“Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.”

“Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?”

“A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,”replied Little Red-Cap.

The wolf thought to himself,“What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful—-she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.”So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said,“See Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here—-why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.”

Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought,“Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay;that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time;”and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.

“Who is there?”

“Little Red-Cap,”replied the wolf.“She is bringing cake and wine;open the door.”

“Lift the latch,”called out the grandmother,“I am too weak, and cannot get up.”



The wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.

Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her. She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself,“Oh dear! how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.”She called out,“Good morning,”but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.

“Oh! grandmother,”she said,“what big ears you have!”

“The better to hear you with, my child,”was the reply.

“But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!”she said.

“The better to see you with, my dear.”

“But, grandmother, what large hands you have!”

“The better to hug you with.”

“Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!”

“The better to eat you with!”

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself,“How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.”So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.“Do I find you here, you old sinner!”said he.“I have long sought you!”Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying,“Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf;”and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's body, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he fell down at once, and fell dead.

Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself,“As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.”

* * * * * * *

It is also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said“good-morning”to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up.“Well,”said the grandmother,“we will shut the door, that he may not come in.”Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried,“Open the door, grandmother, I am little Red-Cap, and am fetching you some cakes.”But they did not speak, or open the door, so the greybeard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough,so she said to the child,“Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.”Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and never did anything to harm any one.





The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs


There was once a poor woman who gave birth to a little son;and as he came into the world with a caul on, it was predicted that in his fourteenth year he would have the King's daughter for his wife. It happened that soon afterwards the King came into the village, and no one knew that he was the King, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered,“A child has just been born with a caul on; whatever any one so born undertakes turns out well. It is prophesied, too, that in his fourteenth year he will have the King's daughter for his wife.”

The King, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said,“You poor people, let me have your child, and I will take care of it.”At first they refused, but when the stranger offered them a large amount of gold for it, and they thought,“It is a luck-child, and everything must turn out well for it,”they at last consented, and gave him the child. The King put it in a box and rode away with it until he came to a deep piece of water; then he threw the box into it and thought,“I have freed my daughter from her unlookedfor suitor.”The box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it. And it floated to within two miles of the King's chief city, where there was a mill, and it came to a standstill at the mill-dam. A miller's boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively. He took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said,“God has given him to us.”They took great care of the foundling, and he grew up in all goodness.

It happened that once in a storm, the King went into the mill, and he asked the mill-folk if the tall youth was their son.“No,”answered they,“he's a foundling. Fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water.”Then the King knew that it was none other than the luck-child which he had thrown into the water, and he said,“My good people, could not the youth take a letter to the Queen; I will give him two gold pieces as a reward?”

“Just as the King commands,”answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness. Then the King wrote a letter to the Queen, wherein he said,“As soon as the boy arrives with this letter, let him be killed and buried, and all must be done before I come home.”

The boy set out with this letter; but he lost his way, and in the evening came to a large forest. In the darkness he saw a small light; he went towards it and reached a cottage. When he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone. She started when she saw the boy, and said,“Whence do you come, and whither are you going?”

“I come from the mill,”he answered,“and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.”

“You poor boy,”said the woman,“you have come into a den of thieves, and when they come home they will kill you.”

“Let them come,”said the boy,“I am not afraid; but I am so tired that I cannot go any farther:”and he stretched himself upon a bench and fell asleep.

Soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there?“Ah,”said the old woman,“it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity I have let him come in;he has to take a letter to the Queen.”The robbers opened the letter and read it, and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived should be put to death. Then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the King's daughter. Then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way. And the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King's daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment.

After some time the King returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter.“How has that come to pass?”said he;“I gave quite another order in my letter.”So the Queen gave him the letter, and said that he might see for himself what was written in it. The King read the letter and saw quite well that it had been exchanged for the other. He asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it.“I know nothing about it,”answered he;“it must have been changed in the night, when I slept in the forest.”The King said in a passion,“You shall not have everything quite so much your own way; whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three golden hairs from the head of the devil; bring me what I want, and you shall keep my daughter.”In this way the King hoped to be rid of him for ever. But the luck-child answered,“I will fetch the golden hairs, I am not afraid of the Devil.”Whereupon he took leave of them and began his journey.

The road led him to a large town, where the watchman by the gates asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.“I know everything,”answered the luck-child.

“Then you can do us a favour,”said the watchman,“if you will tell us why our market-fountain, which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water?”

“That you shall know,”answered he;“only wait until I come back.”Then he went farther and came to another town, and there also the gatekeeper asked him what was his trade, and what he knew.“I know everything,”answered he.

“Then you can do us a favour and tell us why a tree in our town which once bore golden apples now does not even put forth leaves?”

“You shall know that,”answered he;“only wait until I come back.”Then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go. The ferryman asked him what his trade was, and what he knew.“I know everything,”answered he.

“Then you can do me a favour,”said the ferryman,“and tell me why I must always be rowing backwards and forwards, and am never set free?”

“You shall know that,”answered he;“only wait until I come back.”

When he had crossed the water he found the entrance to Hell. It was black and sooty within, and the Devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair.“What do you want?”said she to him, but she did not look so very wicked.“I should like to have three golden hairs from the devil's head,”answered he,“else I cannot keep my wife.”

“That is a good deal to ask for,”said she;“if the devil comes home and finds you, it will cost you your life; but as I pity you, I will see if I cannot help you.”She changed him into an ant and said,“Creep into the folds of my dress, you will be safe there.”

“Yes,”answered he,“so far, so good; but there are three things besides that I want to know: why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water; why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves; and why a ferry-man must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free?”

“Those are difficult questions,”answered she,“but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when I pull out the three golden hairs.”

As the evening came on, the devil returned home. No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.“I smell man's flesh,”said he;“all is not right here.”Then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything. His grandmother scolded him.“It has just been swept,”said she,“and everything put in order, and now you are upsetting it again; you have always got man's flesh in your nose. Sit down and eat your supper.”When he had eaten and drunk he was tired, and laid his head in his grandmother's lap, and before long he was fast asleep, snoring and breathing heavily. Then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down near her.“Oh!”cried the devil,“what are you doing?”

“I have had a bad dream,”answered the grandmother,“so I seized hold of your hair.”

“What did you dream then?”said the devil.

“I dreamed that a fountain in a market-place from which wine once flowed was dried up, and not even water would flow out of it; what is the cause of it?”

“Oh, ho! if they did but know it,”answered the devil;“there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well; if they killed it, the wine would flow again.”He went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook. Then she pulled the second hair out.“Ha! what are you doing?”cried the devil angrily.“Do not take it ill,”said she,“I did it in a dream.”

“What have you dreamt this time?”asked he.

“I dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now would not even bear leaves. What, think you, was the reason?”

“Oh! if they did but know,”answered the devil.“A mouse is gnawing at the root; if they killed this they would have golden apples again, but if it gnaws much longer the tree will wither altogether. But leave me alone with your dreams: if you disturb me in my sleep again you will get a box on the ear.”The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored. Then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out. The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said,“Who can help bad dreams?”

“What was the dream, then?”asked he, and was quite curious.

“I dreamt of a ferry-man who complained that he must always ferry from one side to the other, and was never released. What is the cause of it?”

“Ah! the fool,”answered the devil;“when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free.”As the grandmother had plucked out the three golden hairs, and the three questions were answered, she let the old serpent alone, and he slept until daybreak.

When the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the folds of her dress, and gave the luck-child his human shape again.“There are the three golden hairs for you,”said she.“What the Devil said to your three questions, I suppose you heard?”

“Yes,”answered he,“I heard, and will take care to remember.”

“You have what you want,”said she,“and now you can go your way.”

He thanked the old woman for helping him in his need, and left hell well content that everything had turned out so fortunately. When he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer.“Ferry me across first,”said the luck-child,“and then I will tell you how you can be set free,”and when he reached the opposite shore he gave him the devil's advice:“Next time any one comes, who wants to be ferried over, just put the oar in his hand.”He went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer. So he told him what he had heard from the devil:“Kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden apples.”Then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him. At last he came to the town whose well was dry. He told the watchman what the devil had said:“A toad is in the well beneath a stone;you must find it and kill it, and the well will again give wine in plenty.”The watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold.

At last the luck-child got home to his wife, who was heartily glad to see him again, and to hear how well he had prospered in everything. To the King he took what he had asked for, the devil's three golden hairs, and when the King saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite content, and said,“Now all the conditions are fulfilled, and you can keep my daughter. But tell me, dear son-in-law, where did all that gold come from? this is tremendous wealth!”

“I was rowed across a river,”answered he,“and got it there; it lies on the shore instead of sand.”

“Can I too fetch some of it?”said the King; and he was quite eager about it.

“As much as you like,”answered he.“There is a ferry-man on the river; let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.”The greedy King set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across. The ferry-man came and bade him get in, and when they got to the other shore he put the oar in his hand and sprang out. But from this time forth the King had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins.

“Perhaps he is ferrying still?“

“If he is, it is because no one has taken the oar from him.”





The Tailor in Heaven


One very fine day it came to pass that the good God wished to enjoy himself in the heavenly garden, and took all the apostles and saints with him, so that no one stayed in heaven but Saint Peter. The Lord had commanded him to let no one in during his absence, so Peter stood by the door and kept watch. Before long some one knocked. Peter asked who was there, and what he wanted?“I am a poor, honest tailor who prays for admission,”replied a smooth voice.

“Honest indeed,”said Peter,“like the thief on the gallows! You have been light-fingered and have snipped folks' clothes away. You will not get into heaven. The Lord has forbidden me to let any one in while he is out.”

“Come, do be merciful,”cried the tailor.“Little scraps which fall off the table of their own accord are not stolen, and are not worth speaking about. Look, I am lame, and have blisters on my feet from walking here, I cannot possibly turn back again. Only let me in, and I will do all the rough work. I will carry the children, and wash their clothes, and wash and clean the benches on which they have been playing, and patch all their torn clothes.”Saint Peter let himself be moved by pity, and opened the door of heaven just wide enough for the lame tailor to slip his lean body in. He was forced to sit down in a corner behind the door, and told to stay quietly and peaceably there, in order that the Lord, when he returned, might not observe him and be angry. The tailor obeyed, but once when Saint Peter went outside the door, he got up, and full of curiosity, went round about into every corner of heaven, and inspected the arrangement of every place. At length he came to a spot where many beautiful and delightful chairs were standing, and in the midst was a seat all of gold which was set with shining jewels, likewise it was much higher than the other chairs, and a footstool of gold was before it. It was, however, the seat on which the Lord sat when he was at home, and from which he could see everything which happened on earth. The tailor stood still, and looked at the seat for a long time, for it pleased him better than all else. At last he could master his curiosity no longer, and climbed up and seated himself in the chair. Then he saw everything which was happening on earth, and observed an ugly old woman who was standing washing by the side of a stream, secretly laying two veils on one side for herself. The sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief. As, however, he could not bring the stool back again, he slipped quietly out of the chair, seated himself in his place behind the door, and behaved as if he had never stirred from the spot.

When the Lord and master came back again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing. He asked Saint Peter what had become of the stool, but he did not know. Then he asked if he had let anyone come in.“I know of no one who has been here,”answered Peter,“but a lame tailor, who is still sitting behind the door.”Then the Lord had the tailor brought before him, and asked him if he had taken away the stool, and where he had put it?“Oh, Lord,”answered the tailor joyously,“I threw it in my anger down to earth at an old woman whom I saw stealing two veils at the washing.”

“Oh, you knave,”said the Lord,“were I to judge as you judgest, how do you think you could have escaped so long? I should long ago have had no chairs, benches, seats, nay, not even an oven-fork, but should have thrown everything down at the sinners. Henceforth you can stay no longer in heaven, but must go outside the door again. Then go where you will. No one shall give punishment here, but I alone, the Lord.”

Peter was obliged to take the tailor out of heaven again, and as he had torn shoes, and feet covered with blisters, he took a stick in his hand, and went to“Wait-a-bit,”where the good soldiers sit and make merry.





The Wishing-Table, the Gold-Ass, and the Cudgel in the Sack


There was once upon a time a tailor who had three sons, and only one goat. But as the goat supported the whole of them with her milk, she was obliged to have good food, and to be taken every day to pasture. The sons, therefore, did this, in turn. Once the eldest took her to the churchyard, where the finest herbs were to be found, and let her eat and run about there. At night when it was time to go home he asked,“Goat, have you had enough?”The goat answered,





“I have eaten so much,

Not a leaf more I'll touch, meh! meh!”





“Come home, then,”said the youth, and took hold of the cord round her neck, led her into the stable and tied her up securely.“Well,”said the old tailor,“has the goat had as much food as she ought?”

“Oh,”answered the son,“she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she'll touch.”But the father wished to satisfy himself, and went down to the stable, stroked the dear animal and asked,“Goat, are you satisfied?”The goat answered,





“How should I be satisfied?

Among the ditches I leapt about,

And found no leaf, so went without, meh! meh!”





“What do I hear?”cried the tailor, and ran upstairs and said to the youth,“Hollo, you liar: you said the goat had had enough, and have let her hunger!”and in his anger he took the yard-measure from the wall, and drove him out with blows.

Next day it was the turn of the second son, who looked out for a place in the fence of the garden, where nothing but good herbs grew, and the goat cleared them all off. At night when he wanted to go home, he asked,“Goat, are you satisfied?”The goat answered,





“I have eaten so much,

Not a leaf more I'll touch, meh! meh!”





“Come home, then,”said the youth, and led her home, and tied her up in the stable.“Well,”said the old tailor,“has the goat had as much food as she ought?”

“Oh,”answered the son,“she has eaten so much, not a leaf more she'll touch.”The tailor would not rely on this, but went down to the stable and said,“Goat, have you had enough?”The goat answered,





“How should I be satisfied?

Among the ditches I leapt about,

And found no leaf, so went without, meh! meh!”





“The godless wretch!”cried the tailor,“to let such a good animal hunger,”and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yardmeasure.

Now came the turn of the third son, who wanted to do the thing well, and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves, and let the goat devour them. In the evening when he wanted to go home, he asked,“Goat, have you had enough?”The goat answered,





“I have eaten so much,

Not a leaf more I'll touch, meh! meh!”





“Come home, then,”said the youth, and led her into the stable, and tied her up.“Well,”said the old tailor,“has the goat had a proper amount of food?”

“She has eaten so much, not a leaf more she'll touch.”The tailor did not trust to that, but went down and asked,“Goat, have you had enough?”The wicked beast answered,





“How should I be satisfied?

Among the ditches I leapt about,

And found no leaf, so went without, meh! meh!”





“Oh, the brood of liars!”cried the tailor,“each as wicked and forgetful of his duty as the other! You shall no longer make a fool of me,”and quite beside himself with anger, he ran upstairs and belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure that he sprang out of the house.

The old tailor was now alone with his goat. Next morning he went down into the stable, caressed the goat and said,“Come, my dear little animal, I will take you to feed myself.”He took her by the rope and conducted her to green hedges, and amongst milfoil, and whatever else goats like to eat.“There you may for once eat to your heart's content,”said he to her, and let her browse till evening. Then he asked,“Goat, are you satisfied?”She replied,





“I have eaten so much,

Not a leaf more I'll touch, meh! meh!”





“Come home, then,”said the tailor, and led her into the stable, and tied her fast. When he was going away, he turned round again and said,“Well, are you satisfied for once?”But the goat did not behave the better to him, and cried,





“How should I be satisfied?

Among the ditches I leapt about,

And found no leaf, so went without, meh! meh!”





When the tailor heard that, he was shocked, and saw clearly that he had driven away his three sons without cause.“Wait, you ungrateful creature,”cried he,“it is not enough to drive you forth, I will mark you so that you will no more dare to show yourself amongst honest tailors.”In great haste he ran upstairs, fetched his razor, lathered the goat's head, and shaved her as clean as the palm of his hand. And as the yard-measure would have been too good for her, he brought the horsewhip, and gave her such cuts with it that she ran away in violent haste.

When the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house he fell into great grief, and would gladly have had his sons back again, but no one knew whither they were gone. The eldest had apprenticed himself to a joiner, and learnt industriously and indefatigably, and when the time came for him to go travelling, his master presented him with a little table which had no particular appearance, and was made of common wood, but it had one good property; if anyone set it out, and said,“Little table, spread yourself,”the good little table was at once covered with a clean little cloth, and a plate was there, and a knife and fork beside it, and dishes with boiled meats and roasted meats, as many as there was room for, and a great glass of red wine shone so that it made the heart glad. The young journeyman thought,“With this you have enough for your whole life,”and went joyously about the world and never troubled himself at all whether an inn was good or bad, or if anything was to be found in it or not. When it suited him he did not enter an inn at all, but either on the plain, in a wood, a meadow, or wherever he fancied, he took his little table off his back, set it down before him, and said,“Cover yourself,”and then everything appeared that his heart desired. At length he took it into his head to go back to his father, whose anger would now be appeased, and who would now willingly receive him with his wishing-table. It came to pass that on his way home, he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests. They bade him welcome, and invited him to sit and eat with them, for otherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything.“No,”answered the joiner,“I will not take the few bites out of your mouths; rather than that, you shall be my guests.”They laughed, and thought he was jesting with them; he, however, placed his wooden table in the middle of the room, and said,“Little table, cover yourself.”Instantly it was covered with food, so good that the host could never have procured it, and the smell of it ascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the guests.“Fall to, dear friends,”said the joiner; and the guests when they saw that he meant it, did not need to be asked twice, but drew near, pulled out their knives and attacked it valiantly. And what surprised them the most was that when a dish became empty, a full one instantly took its place of its own accord. The innkeeper stood in one corner and watched the affair; he did not at all know what to say, but thought,“You could easily find a use for such a cook as that in your kitchen.”The joiner and his comrades made merry until late into the night; at length they lay down to sleep, and the young apprentice also went to bed, and set his magic table against the wall. The host's thoughts, however, let him have no rest; it occurred to him that there was a little old table in his lumber-room which looked just like the apprentice's and he brought it out quite softly, and exchanged it for the wishing-table.Next morning, the joiner paid for his bed, took up his table, never thinking that he had got a false one, and went his way. At mid-day he reached his father, who received him with great joy.“Well, my dear son, what have you learnt?”said he to him.

“Father, I have become a joiner.”

“A good trade,”replied the old man;“but what have you brought back with you from your apprenticeship?”

“Father, the best thing which I have brought back with me is this little table.”The tailor inspected it on all sides and said,“You did not make a masterpiece when you made that; it is a bad old table.”

“But it is a table which furnishes itself,”replied the son.“When I set it out, and tell it to cover itself, the most beautiful dishes stand on it, and a wine also, which gladdens the heart. Just invite all our relations and friends, they shall refresh and enjoy themselves for once, for the table will give them all they require.”When the company was assembled, he put his table in the middle of the room and said,“Little table, cover yourself,”but the little table did not bestir itself, and remained just as bare as any other table which did not understand language. Then the poor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed, and was ashamed at having to stand there like a liar. The relations, however, mocked him, and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk. The father brought out his patches again, and went on tailoring, but the son went to a master in the craft.

The second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him. When his years were over, the master said,“As you have conducted yourself so well, I give you an ass of a peculiar kind, which neither draws a cart nor carries a sack.”

“To what use is he put, then?”asked the young apprentice.

“He lets gold drop from his mouth,”answered the miller.“If you settest him on a cloth and say ‘Bricklebrit, ' the good animal will drop gold pieces for you.”

“That is a fine thing,”said the apprentice, and thanked the master, and went out into the world. When he had need of gold, he had only to say“Bricklebrit”to his ass, and it rained gold pieces, and he had nothing to do but pick them off the ground. Wheresoever he went, the best of everything was good enough for him, and the dearer the better, for he had always a full purse. When he had looked about the world for some time, he thought,“You must seek out your father; if you go to him with the gold-ass he will forget his anger, and receive you well.”It came to pass that he came to the same public-house in which his brother's table had been exchanged. He led his ass by the bridle, and the host was about to take the animal from him and tie him up, but the young apprentice said,“Don't trouble yourself, I will take my grey horse into the stable, and tie him up myself too, for I must know where he stands.”This struck the host as odd, and he thought that a man who was forced to look after his ass himself, could not have much to spend; but when the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold pieces, and said he was to provide something good for him, the host opened his eyes wide, and ran and sought out the best he could muster. After dinner the guest asked what he owed. The host did not see why he should not double the reckoning, and said the apprentice must give two more gold pieces. He felt in his pocket, but his gold was just at an end.“Wait an instant, sir host,”said he,“I will go and fetch some money;”but he took the table-cloth with him. The host could not imagine what this could mean, and being curious, stole after him, and as the guest bolted the stable-door, he peeped through a hole left by a knot in the wood. The stranger spread out the cloth under the animal and cried,“Bricklebrit,”and immediately the beast began to let gold pieces fall, so that it fairly rained down money on the ground.“Eh, my word,”said the host,“ducats are quickly coined there! A purse like that is not amiss.”The guest paid his score, and went to bed, but in the night the host stole down into the stable, led away the master of the mint, and tied up another ass in his place. Early next morning the apprentice travelled away with his ass, and thought that he had his gold-ass. At mid-day he reached his father, who rejoiced to see him again, and gladly took him in.“What have you made of yourself, my son?”asked the old man.

“A miller,”dear father, he answered.

“What have you brought back with you from your travels?”

“Nothing else but an ass.”

“There are asses enough here,”said the father,“I would rather have had a good goat.”

“Yes,”replied the son,“but it is no common ass, but a gold-ass, when I say ‘Bricklebrit, ' the good beast opens its mouth and drops a whole sheetful of gold pieces. Just summon all our relations hither, and I will make them rich folks.”

“That suits me well,”said the tailor,“for then I shall have no need to torment myself any longer with the needle,”and ran out himself and called the relations together. As soon as they were assembled, the miller bade them make way, spread out his cloth, and brought the ass into the room.“Now watch,”said he, and cried,“Bricklebrit,”but no gold pieces fell, and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the art, for every ass does not attain such perfection. Then the poor miller pulled a long face, saw that he was betrayed, and begged pardon of the relatives, who went home as poor as they came. There was no help for it, the old man had to betake him to his needle once more, and the youth hired himself to a miller.

The third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner, and as that is skilled labour, he was the longest in learning. His brothers, however, told him in a letter how badly things had gone with them, and how the innkeeper had cheated them of their beautiful wishing-gifts on the last evening before they reached home. When the turner had served his time, and had to set out on his travels, as he had conducted himself so well, his master presented him with a sack and said,“There is a cudgel in it.”

“I can put on the sack,”said he,“and it may be of good service to me, but why should the cudgel be in it? It only makes it heavy.”

“I will tell you why,”replied the master;“if any one has done anything to injure you, do but say, ‘Out of the sack, Cudgel! ' and the cudgel will leap forth among the people, and play such a dance on their backs that they will not be able to stir or move for a week, and it will not leave off until you say, ‘Into the sack, Cudgel! '”The apprentice thanked him, and put the sack on his back, and when any one came too near him, and wished to attack him, he said,“Out of the sack, Cudgel!”and instantly the cudgel sprang out, and dusted the coat or jacket of one after the other on their backs, and never stopped until it had stripped it off them, and it was done so quickly, that before anyone was aware, it was already his own turn. In the evening the young turner reached the inn where his brothers had been cheated. He laid his sack on the table before him, and began to talk of all the wonderful things which he had seen in the world.“Yes,”said he,“people may easily find a table which will cover itself, a gold-ass, and things of that kind—extremely good things which I by no means despise—but these are nothing in comparison with the treasure which I have won for myself, and am carrying about with me in my sack there.”The inn-keeper pricked up his ears,“What in the world can that be?”thought he;“the sack must be filled with nothing but jewels;I ought to get them cheap too, for all good things go in threes.”When it was time for sleep, the guest stretched himself on the bench, and laid his sack beneath him for a pillow. When the inn-keeper thought his guest was lying in a sound sleep, he went to him and pushed and pulled quite gently and carefully at the sack to see if he could possibly draw it away and lay another in its place. The turner had, however, been waiting for this for a long time, and now just as the inn-keeper was about to give a hearty tug, he cried,“Out of the sack, Cudgel!”Instantly the little cudgel came forth, and fell on the inn-keeper and gave him a sound thrashing. The host cried for mercy; but the louder he cried, so much more heavily the cudgel beat the time on his back, until at length he fell to the ground exhausted. Then the turner said,“If you do not give back the table which covers itself, and the gold-ass, the dance shall begin afresh.”“Oh, no,”cried the host, quite humbly,“I will gladly produce everything, only make the accursed kobold creep back into the sack.”Then said the apprentice,“I will let mercy take the place of justice, but beware of getting into mischief again!”So he cried,“Into the sack, Cudgel!”and let him have rest.

Next morning the turner went home to his father with the wishing-table, and the gold-ass. The tailor rejoiced when he saw him once more, and asked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts.“Dear father,”said he,“I have become a turner.”

“A skilled trade,”said the father.“What have you brought back with you from your travels?”

“A precious thing, dear father,”replied the son,“a cudgel in the sack.”

“What!”cried the father,“a cudgel! That's worth your trouble, indeed! From every tree you can cut yourself one.”

“But not one like this, dear father. If I say, ‘Out of the sack, Cudgel! ' the cudgel springs out and leads any one who means ill with me a weary dance, and never stops until he lies on the ground and prays for fair weather. Look you, with this cudgel have I got back the wishing-table and the gold-ass which the thievish inn-keeper took away from my brothers. Now let them both be sent for, and invite all our kinsmen. I will give them to eat and to drink, and will fill their pockets with gold into the bargain.”The old tailor would not quite believe, but nevertheless got the relatives together. Then the turner spread a cloth in the room and led in the goldass, and said to his brother,“Now, dear brother, speak to him.”The miller said,“Bricklebrit,”and instantly the gold pieces fell down on the cloth like a thunder-shower, and the ass did not stop until every one of them had so much that he could carry no more. (I can see in your face that you also would like to be there.) Then the turner brought the little table,and said,“Now dear brother, speak to it.”And scarcely had the carpenter said,“Table, cover yourself,”than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite dishes. Then such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet known in his house, and the whole party of kinsmen stayed together till far in the night, and were all merry and glad. The tailor locked away needle and thread, yard-measure and goose, in a press, and lived with his three sons in joy and splendour.

What, however, has become of the goat who was to blame for the tailor driving out his three sons? That I will tell you. She was ashamed that she had a bald head, and ran to a fox's hole and crept into it. When the fox came home, he was met by two great eyes shining out of the darkness, and was terrified and ran away. A bear met him, and as the fox looked quite disturbed, he said,“What is the matter with you, brother Fox, why do you look like that?”

“Ah,”answered Redskin,“a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me with its fiery eyes.”

“We will soon drive him out,”said the bear, and went with him to the cave and looked in, but when he saw the fiery eyes, fear seized on him likewise; he would have nothing to do with the furious beast, and took to his heels. The bee met him, and as she saw that he was ill at ease, she said,“Bear, you are really pulling a very pitiful face; what has become of all your gaiety?”

“It is all very well for you to talk,”replied the bear,“a furious beast with staring eyes is in Redskin's house, and we can't drive him out.”

The bee said,“Bear I pity you, I am a poor weak creature whom you would not turn aside to look at, but still, I believe, I can help you.”She flew into the fox's cave, lighted on the goat's smoothly-shorn head, and stung her so violently, that she sprang up, crying“Meh, meh,”and ran forth into the world as if mad, and to this hour no one knows where she has gone.





Godfather Death


A poor man had twelve children and was forced to work night and day to give them even bread. When therefore the thirteenth came into the world, he knew not what to do in his trouble, but ran out into the great highway, and resolved to ask the first person whom he met to be godfather. The first to meet him was the good God who already knew what filled his heart, and said to him,“Poor man, I pity you. I will hold your child at its christening, and will take charge of it and make it happy on earth.”

The man said,“Who are you?”

“I am God.”

“Then I do not desire to have you for a godfather,”said the man;“you give to the rich, and leave the poor to hunger.”Thus spoke the man, for he did not know how wisely God apportions riches and poverty. He turned therefore away from the Lord, and went farther.

Then the Devil came to him and said,“What do you seek? If you will take me as a godfather for your child, I will give him gold in plenty and all the joys of the world as well.”

The man asked,“Who are you?”

“I am the Devil.”

“Then I do not desire to have you for godfather,”said the man;“you deceive men and lead them astray.”He went onwards, and then came Death striding up to him with withered legs, and said,“Take me as godfather.”

The man asked,“Who are you?”

“I am Death, and I make all equal.”

Then said the man,“You are the right one, you take the rich as well as the poor, without distinction; you shall be godfather.”

Death answered,“I will make your child rich and famous, for he who has me for a friend can lack nothing.”The man said,“Next Sunday is the christening; be there at the right time.”Death appeared as he had promised, and stood godfather quite in the usual way.

When the boy had grown up, his godfather one day appeared and bade him go with him. He led him forth into a forest, and showed him a herb which grew there, and said,“Now shall you receive your godfather's present. I make you a celebrated physician. When you are called to a patient, I will always appear to you. If I stand by the head of the sick man, you may say with confidence that you will make him well again, and if you give him of this herb he will recover; but if I stand by the patient's feet, he is mine, and you must say that all remedies are in vain, and that no physician in the world could save him. But beware of using the herb against my will, or it might fare ill with you.”

It was not long before the youth was the most famous physician in the whole world.“He had only to look at the patient and he knew his condition at once, and if he would recover, or must needs die.”So they said of him, and from far and wide people came to him, sent for him when they had any one ill, and gave him so much money that he soon became a rich man. Now it so befell that the King became ill, and the physician was summoned, and was to say if recovery were possible. But when he came to the bed, Death was standing by the feet of the sick man, and the herb did not grow which could save him.“If I could but cheat Death for once,”thought the physician,“he is sure to take it ill if I do, but, as I am his godson, he will shut one eye; I will risk it.”He therefore took up the sick man, and laid him the other way, so that now Death was standing by his head. Then he gave the King some of the herb, and he recovered and grew healthy again. But Death came to the physician, looking very black and angry, threatened him with his finger, and said,“You have overreached me;this time I will pardon it, as you are my godson; but if you venture it again, it will cost you your neck, for I will take you yourself away with me.”

Soon afterwards the King's daughter fell into a severe illness. She was his only child, and he wept day and night, so that he began to lose the sight of his eyes, and he caused it to be made known that whosoever rescued her from death should be her husband and inherit the crown. When the physician came to the sick girl's bed, he saw Death by her feet. He ought to have remembered the warning given by his godfather, but he was so infatuated by the great beauty of the King's daughter, and the happiness of becoming her husband, that he flung all thought to the winds. He did not see that Death was casting angry glances on him, that he was raising his hand in the air, and threatening him with his withered fist. He raised up the sick girl, and placed her head where her feet had lain. Then he gave her some of the herb, and instantly her cheeks flushed red, and life stirred afresh in her.

When Death saw that for a second time he was defrauded of his own property, he walked up to the physician with long strides, and said,“All is over with you, and now the lot falls on you,”and seized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand, that he could not resist, and led him into a cave below the earth. There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows, some large, others half-sized, others small. Every instant some were extinguished, and others again burnt up, so that the flames seemed to leap hither and thither in perpetual change.“See,”said Death,“these are the lights of men's lives. The large ones belong to children, the half-sized ones to married people in their prime, the little ones belong to old people; but children and young folks likewise have often only a tiny candle.”

“Show me the light of my life,”said the physician, and he thought that it would be still very tall. Death pointed to a little end which was just threatening to go out, and said,“Behold, it is there.”

“Ah, dear godfather,”said the horrified physician,“light a new one for me, do it for love of me, that I may enjoy my life, be King, and the husband of the King's beautiful daughter.”

“I cannot,”answered Death,“one must go out before a new one is lighted.”

“Then place the old one on a new one, that will go on burning at once when the old one has come to an end,”pleaded the physician. Death behaved as if he were going to fulfill his wish, and took hold of a tall new candle; but as he desired to revenge himself, he purposely made a mistake in fixing it, and the little piece fell down and was extinguished. Immediately the physician fell on the ground, and now he himself was in the hands of Death.





The Six Swans


Once upon a time, a certain King was hunting in a great forest, and he chased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants could follow him. When evening drew near he stopped and looked around him, and then he saw that he had lost his way. He sought a way out, but could find none. Then he perceived an aged woman with a head which nodded perpetually, who came towards him, but she was a witch.“Good woman,”said he to her,“Can you not show me the way through the forest?”

“Oh, yes, Lord King,”she answered,“that I certainly can, but on one condition, and if you do not fulfil that, you will never get out of the forest, and will die of hunger in it.”

“What kind of condition is it?”asked the King.

“I have a daughter,”said the old woman,“who is as beautiful as any one in the world, and well deserves to be your consort, and if you will make her your Queen, I will show you the way out of the forest.”

In the anguish of his heart the King consented, and the old woman led him to her little hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire. She received the King as if she had been expecting him, and he saw that she was very beautiful, but still she did not please him, and he could not look at her without secret horror. After he had taken the maiden up on his horse, the old woman showed him the way, and the King reached his royal palace again, where the wedding was celebrated.

The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife,seven children, six boys and a girl, whom he loved better than anything else in the world. As he now feared that the step-mother might not treat them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest. It lay so concealed, and the way was so difficult to find that he himself would not have found it, if a wise woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful properties. When he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and showed him his path. The King, however, went so frequently away to his dear children that the Queen observed his absence; she was curious and wanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest. She gave a great deal of money to his servants, and they betrayed the secret to her, and told her likewise of the ball which alone could point out the way. And now she knew no rest until she had learnt where the King kept the ball of yarn, and then she made little shirts of white silk, and as she had learnt the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a charm inside them. And once when the King had ridden forth to hunt, she took the little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the way. The children, who saw from a distance that some one was approaching, thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy, ran to meet him. Then she threw one of the little shirts over each of them, and no sooner had the shirts touched their bodies than they were changed into swans, and flew away over the forest. The Queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of her stepchildren, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the Queen knew nothing about her. Next day the King went to visit his children, but he found no one but the little girl.“Where are your brothers?”asked the King.

“Alas, dear father,”she answered,“they have gone away and left me alone!”and she told him that she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up. The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done this wicked deed, and as he feared that the girl would also be stolen away from him, he wanted to take her away with him. But she was afraid of her step-mother, and entreated the King to let her stay just this one night more in the forest castle.

The poor girl thought,“I can no longer stay here. I will go and seek my brothers.”And when night came, she ran away, and went straight into the forest. She walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping, until she could go no farther for weariness. Then she saw a forest-hut, and went into it, and found a room with six little beds, but she did not venture to get into one of them, but crept under one, and lay down on the hard ground, intending to pass the night there. Just before sunset, however, she heard a rustling, and saw six swans come flying in at the window. They alighted on the ground and blew at each other, and blew all the feathers off, and their swan's skins stripped off like a shirt. Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed. The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was of short duration.“Here can you not abide,”they said to her.“This is a shelter for robbers, if they come home and find you, they will kill you.”

“But can you not protect me?”asked the little sister.

“No,”they replied,“only for one quarter of an hour each evening can we lay aside our swan's skins and have during that time our human form;after that, we are once more turned into swans.”The little sister wept and said,“Can you not be set free?”

“Alas, no,”they answered,“the conditions are too hard! For six years you may neither speak nor laugh, and in that time you must sew together six little shirts of starwort for us. And if one single word falls from your lips, all your work will be lost.”And when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over, and they flew out of the window again as swans.

The maiden, however, firmly resolved to deliver her brothers, even if it should cost her her life. She left the hut, went into the midst of the forest, seated herself on a tree, and there passed the night. Next morning she went out and gathered starwort and began to sew. She could not speak to any one, and she had no inclination to laugh; she sat there and looked at nothing but her work. When she had already spent a long time there it came to pass that the King of the country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen came to the tree on which the maiden was sitting. They called to her and said,“Who are you?”But she made no answer.“Come down to us,”said they.“We will not do you any harm.”She only shook her head. As they pressed her further with questions she threw her golden necklace down to them, and thought to content them thus. They, however, did not cease, and then she threw her girdle down to them, and as this also was to no purpose, her garters, and by degrees everything that she had on that she could do without until she had nothing left but her shift. The huntsmen, however, did not let themselves be turned aside by that, but climbed the tree and fetched the maiden down and led her before the King. The King asked,“Who are you? What are you doing on the tree?”But she did not answer. He put the question in every language that he knew, but she remained as mute as a fish. As she was so beautiful, the King's heart was touched, and he was smitten with a great love for her. He put his mantle on her, took her before him on his horse, and carried her to his castle. Then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments, and she shone in her beauty like bright daylight, but no word could be drawn from her. He placed her by his side at table, and her modest bearing and courtesy pleased him so much that he said,“She is the one whom I wish to marry, and no other woman in the world.”And after some days he united himself to her.

The King, however, had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen.“Who knows,”said she,“from whence the creature who can't speak, comes? She is not worthy of a king!”After a year had passed, when the Queen brought her first child into the world, the old woman took it away from her, and smeared her mouth with blood as she slept. Then she went to the King and accused the Queen of being a man-eater. The King would not believe it, and would not suffer any one to do her any injury. She, however, sat continually sewing at the shirts, and cared for nothing else. The next time, when she again bore a beautiful boy, the false step-mother used the same treachery, but the King could not bring himself to give credit to her words. He said,“She is too pious and good to do anything of that kind; if she were not dumb, and could defend herself, her innocence would come to light.”But when the old woman stole away the newly-born child for the third time, and accused the Queen, who did not utter one word of defence, the King could do no otherwise than deliver her over to justice, and she was sentenced to suffer death by fire.

When the day came for the sentence to be executed, it was the last day of the six years during which she was not to speak or laugh, and she had delivered her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment. The six shirts were ready, only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting. When, therefore, she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm, and when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be lighted, she looked around and six swans came flying through the air towards her. Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart leapt with joy. The swans swept towards her and sank down so that she could throw the shirts over them, and as they were touched by them, their swan's skins fell off, and her brothers stood in their own bodily form before her, and were vigorous and handsome. The youngest only lacked his left arm, and had in the place of it a swan's wing on his shoulder. They embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen went to the King, who was greatly moved, and she began to speak and said,“Dearest husband, now I may speak and declare to you that I am innocent, and falsely accused.”And she told him of the treachery of the old woman who had taken away her three children and hidden them. Then to the great joy of the King they were brought thither, and as a punishment, the wicked step-mother was bound to the stake, and burnt to ashes. But the King and the Queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace.





Briar-Rose


A long time ago there were a King and Queen who said every day,“Ah, if only we had a child!”but they never had one. But it happened that once when the Queen was bathing, a frog crept out of the water on to the land, and said to her,“Your wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has gone by, you shall have a daughter.”

What the frog had said came true, and the Queen had a little girl who was so pretty that the King could not contain himself for joy, and ordered a great feast. He invited not only his kindred, friends and acquaintance, but also the Wise Women, in order that they might be kind and welldisposed towards the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but, as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out of, one of them had to be left at home.

The feast was held with all manner of splendour and when it came to an end the Wise Women bestowed their magic gifts upon the baby: one gave virtue, another beauty, a third riches, and so on with everything in the world that one can wish for.

When eleven of them had made their promises, suddenly the thirteenth came in. She wished to avenge herself for not having been invited, and without greeting, or even looking at any one, she cried with a loud voice,“The King's daughter shall in her fifteenth year prick herself with a spindle, and fall down dead.”And, without saying a word more, she turned round and left the room.

They were all shocked; but the twelfth, whose good wish still remained unspoken, came forward, and as she could not undo the evil sentence, but only soften it, she said,“It shall not be death, but a deep sleep of a hundred years, into which the princess shall fall.”

The King, who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune, gave orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt. Meanwhile the gifts of the Wise Women were plenteously fulfilled on the young girl, for she was so beautiful, modest, good-natured, and wise, that everyone who saw her was bound to love her.

It happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old, the King and Queen were not at home, and the maiden was left in the palace quite alone. So she went round into all sorts of places, looked into rooms and bed-chambers just as she liked, and at last came to an old tower. She climbed up the narrow winding-staircase, and reached a little door. A rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there in a little room sat an old woman with a spindle, busily spinning her flax.“Good day, old dame,”said the King's daughter;“what are you doing there?”

“I am spinning,”said the old woman, and nodded her head.

“What sort of thing is that, that rattles round so merrily?”said the girl, and she took the spindle and wanted to spin too. But scarcely had she touched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it.

And, in the very moment when she felt the prick, she fell down upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep. And this sleep extended over the whole palace; the King and Queen who had just come home, and had entered the great hall, began to go to sleep, and the whole of the court with them. The horses, too, went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons upon the roof, the flies on the wall; even the fire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet and slept, the roast meat left off frizzling, and the cook, who was just going to pull the hair of the scullery boy, because he had forgotten something, let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind fell, and on the trees before the castle not a leaf moved again.

But round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of thorns, which every year became higher, and at last grew close up round the castle and all over it, so that there was nothing of it to be seen, not even the flag upon the roof. But the story of the beautiful sleeping“Briar-rose,”for so the princess was named, went about the country, so that from time to time kings' sons came and tried to get through the thorny hedge into the castle. But they found it impossible, for the thorns held fast together, as if they had hands, and the youths were caught in them, could not get loose again, and died a miserable death. After long, long years a King's son came again to that country, and heard an old man talking about the thorn-hedge, and that a castle was said to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful princess, named Briar-rose, had been asleep for a hundred years; and that the King and Queen and the whole court were asleep likewise. He had heard, too, from his grandfather, that many kings' sons had already come, and had tried to get through the thorny hedge, but they had remained sticking fast in it, and had died a pitiful death. Then the youth said,“I am not afraid, I will go and see the beautiful Briar-rose.”The good old man might dissuade him as he would, he did not listen to his words.

But by this time the hundred years had just passed, and the day had come when Briar-rose was to awake again. When the King's son came near to the thorn-hedge, it was nothing but large and beautiful flowers, which parted from each other of their own accord, and let him pass unhurt, then they closed again behind him like a hedge. In the castle-yard he saw the horses and the spotted hounds lying asleep; on the roof sat the pigeons with their heads under their wings. And when he entered the house, the flies were asleep upon the wall, the cook in the kitchen was still holding out his hand to seize the boy, and the maid was sitting by the black hen which she was going to pluck.



He went on farther, and in the great hall he saw the whole of the court lying asleep, and up by the throne lay the King and Queen.

Then he went on still farther, and all was so quiet that a breath could be heard, and at last he came to the tower, and opened the door into the little room where Briar-rose was sleeping. There she lay, so beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away; and he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But as soon as he kissed her, Briar-rose opened her eyes and awoke, and looked at him quite sweetly.

Then they went down together, and the King awoke, and the Queen, and the whole court, and looked at each other in great astonishment. And the horses in the court-yard stood up and shook themselves; the hounds jumped up and wagged their tails; the pigeons upon the roof pulled out their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the open country; the flies on the wall crept again; the fire in the kitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat; the joint began to turn and sizzle again, and the cook gave the boy such a box on the ear that he screamed, and the maid plucked the fowl ready for the spit.

And then the marriage of the King's son with Briar-rose was celebrated with all splendour, and they lived contented to the end of their days.





Little Snow-white


Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself,“Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame.”

Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony; and she was therefore called Little Snow-white. And when the child was born, the Queen died.

After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said—





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





the looking-glass answered—





“You, O Queen, art the fairest of all!”





Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.

But Snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful;and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass —





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





it answered—





“You are fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen.

But more beautiful still is Snow-white, as I ween.”





Then the Queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much. And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said,“Take the child away into the forest; I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a token.”The huntsman obeyed, and took her away;but when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce Snow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and said,“Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.”And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said,“Run away, then, you poor child.”“The wild beasts will soon have devoured you,”thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her. And as a young boar just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as proof that the child was dead. The cook had to salt this, and the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the heart of Snow-white.

But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not know what to do. Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm. She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening; then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon;moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.

Little Snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only. Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited her; one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep.

When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back; they were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore. They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it.

The first said,“Who has been sitting on my chair?”

The second,“Who has been eating off my plate?”

The third,“Who has been taking some of my bread?”

The fourth,“Who has been eating my vegetables?”

The fifth,“Who has been using my fork?”

The sixth,“Who has been cutting with my knife?”

The seventh,“Who has been drinking out of my mug?”

Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his bed, and he said,“Who has been getting into my bed?”The others came up and each called out,“Somebody has been lying in my bed too.”But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-white, who was lying asleep therein. And he called the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow-white.“Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!”cried they,“what a lovely child!”and they were so glad that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through the night.

When it was morning little Snow-white awoke, and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her name was.

“My name is Snow-white,”she answered.

“How have you come to our house?”said the dwarfs.

Then she told them that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.

The dwarfs said,“If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and clean, you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.”

“Yes,”said Snow-white,“with all my heart,”and she stayed with them.

She kept the house in order for them; in the mornings they went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready. The girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her and said,“Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you are here; be sure to let no one come in.”

But the Queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-white's heart, could not but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all;and she went to her looking-glass and said—





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





and the glass answered —





“Oh, Queen, you are fairest of all I see,

But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,

Snow-white is still alive and well,

And none is so fair as she.”





Then she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass never spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little Snow-white was still alive.

And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her have no rest.

And when she had at last thought of something to do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old pedler-woman, and no one could have known her.

In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried,“Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap.”

Little Snow-white looked out of the window and called out,“Good-day my good woman, what have you to sell?”

“Good things, pretty things,”she answered;“stay-laces of all colours,”and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk.

“I may let the worthy old woman in,”thought Snow-white, and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.

“Child,”said the old woman,“what a fright you look; come, I will lace you properly for once.”Snow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself be laced with the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that Snow-white lost her breath and fell down as if dead.“Now I am the most beautiful,”said the Queen to herself, and ran away.

Not long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home, but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snow-white lying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to be dead. They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces; then she began to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said,“The old pedler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen; take care and let no one come in when we are not with you.”

But the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the glass and asked—





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





and it answered as before—





“Oh, Queen, you are fairest of all I see,

But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,

Snow-white is still alive and well,

And none is so fair as she.”





When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that little Snow-white was again alive.“But now,”she said,“I will think of something that shall put an end to you,”and by the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb. Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman. So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door, and cried,“Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!”

Little Snow-white looked out and said,“Go away; I cannot let any one come in.”

“I suppose you can look,”said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door. When they had made a bargain the old woman said,“Now I will comb you properly for once.”Poor little Snow-white had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl fell down senseless.“You paragon of beauty,”said the wicked woman,“you are done for now,”and she went away.

But fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow-white lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked and found the poisoned comb. Scarcely had they taken it out when Snow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one.

The Queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said—





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





then it answered as before—





“Oh, Queen, you are fairest of all I see,

But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,

Snow-white is still alive and well,

And none is so fair as she.”





When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.“Snow-white shall die,”she cried,“even if it costs me my life!”Thereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no one ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that everyone who saw it longed for it;but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die. When the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself up as a country-woman, and so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs. She knocked at the door. Snow-white put her head out of the window and said,“I cannot let any one in; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.”

“It is all the same to me,”answered the woman,“I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one.”

“No,”said Snow-white,“I dare not take anything.”

“Are you afraid of poison?”said the old woman;“look, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.”The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead. Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look,and laughed aloud and said,“White as snow, red as blood, black as ebonywood! this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again.”



And when she asked of the Looking-glass at home—





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





it answered at last —





“Oh, Queen, in this land you are fairest of all.”





Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest.

The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying upon the ground; she breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use; the poor child was dead, and remained dead. They laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days long. Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were living, and still had her pretty red cheeks. They said,“We could not bury her in the dark ground,”and they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always stayed by it and watched it. And birds came too, and wept for Snow-white; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.

And now Snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as snow,as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.

It happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs,“Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.”But the dwarfs answered,“We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.”

Then he said,“Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession.”

As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin. and now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive.“Oh, heavens, where am I?”she cried.

The King's son, full of joy, said,“You are with me,”and told her what had happened, and said,“I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.”And Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour.

But Snow-white's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the Looking-glass, and said—





“Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,

Who in this land is the fairest of all?”





the glass answered—





“Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest are you,

But the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow.”





Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched, that she knew not what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young Queen. And when she went in she knew Snow-white; and she stood still with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before her. Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance until she dropped down dead.





The Golden Bird


In the olden time there was a king, who had behind his palace a beautiful pleasure-garden in which there was a tree that bore golden apples. When the apples were getting ripe they were counted, but on the very next morning one was missing. This was told to the King, and he ordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree. The King had three sons, the eldest of whom he sent, as soon as night came on, into the garden; but when midnight came he could not keep himself from sleeping, and next morning again an apple was gone. The following night the second son had to keep watch, it fared no better with him; as soon as twelve o'clock had struck he fell asleep, and in the morning an apple was gone. Now it came to the turn of the third son to watch; and he was quite ready, but the King had not much trust in him, and thought that he would be of less use even than his brothers; but at last he let him go. The youth lay down beneath the tree, but kept awake, and did not let sleep master him. When it struck twelve, something rustled through the air, and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose feathers were all shining with gold. The bird alighted on the tree, and had just plucked off an apple, when the youth shot an arrow at him. The bird flew off, but the arrow had struck his plumage, and one of his golden feathers fell down. The youth picked it up, and the next morning took it to the King and told him what he had seen in the night. The King called his council together, and everyone declared that a feather like this was worth more than the whole kingdom.“If the feather is so precious,”declared the King,“one alone will not do for me; I must and will have the whole bird!”

The eldest son set out; he trusted to his cleverness, and thought that he would easily find the Golden Bird. When he had gone some distance he saw a Fox sitting at the edge of a wood, so he cocked his gun and took aim at him. The Fox cried,“Do not shoot me! and in return I will give you some good counsel. You are on the way to the Golden Bird; and this evening you will come to a village in which stand two inns opposite to one another. One of them is lighted up brightly, and all goes on merrily within, but do not go into it; go rather into the other, even though it seems a bad one.”

“How can such a silly beast give wise advice?”thought the King's son, and he pulled the trigger. But he missed the Fox, who stretched out his tail and ran quickly into the wood. So he pursued his way, and by evening came to the village where the two inns were; in one they were singing and dancing; the other had a poor, miserable look.“I should be a fool, indeed,”he thought,“if I were to go into the shabby tavern, and pass by the good one.”So he went into the cheerful one, lived there in riot and revel, and forgot the bird and his father, and all good counsels.

When some time had passed, and the eldest son for month after month did not come back home, the second set out, wishing to find the Golden Bird. The Fox met him as he had met the eldest, and gave him the good advice of which he took no heed. He came to the two inns, and his brother was standing at the window of the one from which came the music, and called out to him. He could not resist, but went inside and lived only for pleasure.

Again some time passed, and then the King's youngest son wanted to set off and try his luck, but his father would not allow it.“It is of no use,”said he,“he will find the Golden Bird still less than his brothers, and if a mishap were to befall him he knows not how to help himself; he is a little wanting at the best.”But at last, as he had no peace, he let him go.

Again the Fox was sitting outside the wood, and begged for his life, and offered his good advice. The youth was good-natured, and said,“Be easy, little Fox, I will do you no harm.”

“You shall not repent it,”answered the Fox;“and that you may get on more quickly, get up behind on my tail.”And scarcely had he seated himself when the Fox began to run, and away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in the wind. When they came to the village the youth got off; he followed the good advice, and without looking round turned into the little inn, where he spent the night quietly. The next morning, as soon as he got into the open country, there sat the Fox already, and said,“I will tell you further what you have to do. Go on quite straight, and at last you will come to a castle, in front of which a whole regiment of soldiers is lying, but do not trouble yourself about them, for they will all be asleep and snoring. Go through the midst of them straight into the castle, and go through all the rooms, till at last you will come to a chamber where a Golden Bird is hanging in a wooden cage. Close by, there stands an empty gold cage for show, but beware of taking the bird out of the common cage and putting it into the fine one, or it may go badly with you.”With these words the Fox again stretched out his tail, and the King's son seated himself upon it, and away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in the wind. When he came to the castle he found everything as the Fox had said. The King's son went into the chamber where the Golden Bird was shut up in a wooden cage, whilst a golden one stood hard by; and the three golden apples lay about the room.“But,”thought he,“it would be absurd if I were to leave the beautiful bird in the common and ugly cage,”so he opened the door, laid hold of it, and put it into the golden cage. But at the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry. The soldiers awoke, rushed in, and took him off to prison. The next morning he was taken before a court of justice, and as he confessed everything, was sentenced to death. The King, however, said that he would grant him his life on one condition namely, if he brought him the Golden Horse which ran faster than the wind; and in that case he should receive, over and above, as a reward, the Golden Bird.

The King's son set off, but he sighed and was sorrowful, for how was he to find the Golden Horse? But all at once he saw his old friend the Fox sitting on the road.“Look you,”said the Fox,“this has happened because you did not give heed to me. However, be of good courage. I will give you my help, and tell you how to get to the Golden Horse. You must go straight on, and you will come to a castle, where in the stable stands the horse. The grooms will be lying in front of the stable; but they will be asleep and snoring, and you can quietly lead out the Golden Horse. But of one thing you must take heed; put on him the common saddle of wood and leather, and not the golden one, which hangs close by, else it will go ill with you.”Then the Fox stretched out his tail, the King's son seated himself upon it, and away he went over stock and stone until his hair whistled in the wind. Everything happened just as the Fox had said;the prince came to the stable in which the Golden Horse was standing, but just as he was going to put the common saddle upon him, he thought,“It will be a shame to such a beautiful beast, if I do not give him the good saddle which belongs to him by right.”But scarcely had the golden saddle touched the horse than he began to neigh loudly. The grooms awoke, seized the youth, and threw him into prison. The next morning he was sentenced by the court to death; but the King promised to grant him his life, and the Golden Horse as well, if he could bring back the beautiful princess from the Golden Castle.

With a heavy heart the youth set out; yet luckily for him he soon found the trusty Fox.“I ought only to leave you to your ill-luck,”said the Fox,“but I pity you, and will help you once more out of your trouble. This road takes you straight to the Golden Castle, you will reach it by eventide; and at night when everything is quiet the beautiful princess goes to the bathing-house to bathe. When she enters it, run up to her and give her a kiss, then she will follow you, and you can take her away with you;only do not allow her to take leave of her parents first, or it will go ill with you.”Then the Fox stretched out his tail, the King's son seated himself upon it, and away the Fox went, over stock and stone, till his hair whistled in the wind. When he reached the Golden Castle it was just as the Fox had said. He waited until midnight, when everything lay in deep sleep, and the beautiful princess was going to the bathing-house. Then he sprang out and gave her a kiss. She said that she would like to go with him, but she asked him pitifully, and with tears, to allow her first to take leave of her parents. At first he withstood her prayer, but when she wept more and more, and fell at his feet, he at last gave in. But no sooner had the maiden reached the bedside of her father than he and all the rest in the castle awoke, and the youth was laid hold of and put into prison.

The next morning the King said to him,“Your life is forfeited, and you can only find mercy if you take away the hill which stands in front of my windows, and prevents my seeing beyond it; and you must finish it all within eight days. If you do that you shall have my daughter as your reward.”The King's son began, and dug and shovelled without leaving off, but when after seven days he saw how little he had done, and how all his work was as good as nothing, he fell into great sorrow and gave up all hope. But on the evening of the seventh day the Fox appeared and said,“You do not deserve that I should take any trouble about you; but just go away and lie down to sleep, and I will do the work for you.”The next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the hill had gone. The youth ran, full of joy, to the King, and told him that the task was fulfilled, and whether he liked it or not, the King had to hold to his word and give him his daughter.

So the two set forth together, and it was not long before the trusty Fox came up with them.“You have certainly got what is best,”said he,“but the Golden Horse also belongs to the maiden of the Golden Castle.”

“How shall I get it?”asked the youth.

“That I will tell you,”answered the Fox;“first take the beautiful maiden to the King who sent you to the Golden Castle. There will be unheard-of rejoicing; they will gladly give you the Golden Horse, and will bring it out to you. Mount it as soon as possible, and offer your hand to all in farewell; last of all to the beautiful maiden. And as soon as you have taken her hand swing her up on to the horse, and gallop away, and no one will be able to bring you back, for the horse runs faster than the wind.”

All was carried out successfully, and the King's son carried off the beautiful princess on the Golden Horse. The Fox did not remain behind, and he said to the youth,“Now I will help you to get the Golden Bird. When you come near to the castle where the Golden Bird is to be found, let the maiden get down, and I will take her into my care. Then ride with the Golden Horse into the castle-yard; there will be great rejoicing at the sight, and they will bring out the Golden Bird for you. As soon as you have the cage in your hand gallop back to us, and take the maiden away again.”When the plan had succeeded, and the King's son was about to ride home with his treasures, the Fox said,“Now you shall reward me for my help.”

“What do you require for it?”asked the youth.

“When you get into the wood yonder, shoot me dead, and chop off my head and feet.”

“That would be fine gratitude,”said the King's son.“I cannot possibly do that for you.”

The Fox said,“If you will not do it I must leave you, but before I go away I will give you a piece of good advice. Be careful about two things. Buy no gallows'-flesh, and do not sit at the edge of any well.”And then he ran into the wood.

The youth thought,“That is a wonderful beast, he has strange whims;who is going to buy gallows'-flesh? and the desire to sit at the edge of a well it has never yet seized me.”He rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his road took him again through the village in which his two brothers had remained. There was a great stir and noise, and, when he asked what was going on, he was told that two men were going to be hanged. As he came nearer to the place he saw that they were his brothers, who had been playing all kinds of wicked pranks, and had squandered all their wealth. He inquired whether they could not be set free.“If you will pay for them,”answered the people;“but why should you waste your money on wicked men, and buy them free.”He did not think twice about it, but paid for them, and when they were set free they all went on their way together.

They came to the wood where the Fox had first met them, as it was cool and pleasant within it, the two brothers said,“Let us rest a little by the well, and eat and drink.”He agreed, and whilst they were talking he forgot himself, and sat down upon the edge of the well without thinking of any evil. But the two brothers threw him backwards into the well, took the maiden, the Horse, and the Bird, and went home to their father.“Here we bring you not only the Golden Bird,”said they;“we have won the Golden Horse also, and the maiden from the Golden Castle.”Then was there great joy; but the Horse would not eat, the Bird would not sing, and the maiden sat and wept.

But the youngest brother was not dead. By good fortune the well was dry, and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt, but he could not get out again. Even in this strait the faithful Fox did not leave him: it came and leapt down to him, and upbraided him for having forgotten its advice.“But yet I cannot give it up so,”he said;“I will help you up again into daylight.”He bade him grasp his tail and keep tight hold of it; and then he pulled him up.“You are not out of all danger yet,”said the Fox.“Your brothers were not sure of your death, and have surrounded the wood with watchers, who are to kill you if you let yourself be seen.”But a poor man was sitting upon the road, with whom the youth changed clothes, and in this way he got to the King's palace. No one knew him, but the Bird began to sing, the Horse began to eat, and the beautiful maiden left off weeping. The King, astonished, asked,“What does this mean?”Then the maiden said,“I do not know, but I have been so sorrowful and now I am so happy! I feel as if my true bridegroom had come.”She told him all that had happened, although the other brothers had threatened her with death if she were to betray anything. The King commanded that all people who were in his castle should be brought before him; and amongst them came the youth in his ragged clothes; but the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck. The wicked brothers were seized and put to death, but he was married to the beautiful maiden and declared heir to the King.

But how did it fare with the poor Fox? Long afterwards the King's son was once again walking in the wood, when the Fox met him and said,“You have everything now that you can wish for, but there is never an end to my misery, and yet it is in your power to free me,”and again he asked him with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and feet. So he did it, and scarcely was it done when the Fox was changed into a man, and was no other than the brother of the beautiful princess, who at last was freed from the magic charm which had been laid upon him. And now nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived.





The Queen Bee


Two kings' sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into a wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again. The youngest, who was called Simpleton, set out to seek his brothers, but when at length he found them they mocked him for thinking that he with his simplicity could get through the world, when they two could not make their way, and yet were so much cleverer. They all three travelled away together, and came to an ant-hill. The two elder wanted to destroy it, to see the little ants creeping about in their terror, and carrying their eggs away, but Simpleton said,“Leave the creatures in peace; I will not allow you to disturb them.”Then they went onwards and came to a lake, on which a great number of ducks were swimming. The two brothers wanted to catch a couple and roast them, but Simpleton would not permit it, and said,“Leave the creatures in peace, I will not suffer you to kill them.”At length they came to a bee's nest, in which there was so much honey that it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was. The two wanted to make a fire beneath the tree, and suffocate the bees in order to take away the honey, but Simpleton again stopped them and said,“Leave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to burn them.”At length the three brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses were standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen, and they went through all the halls until, quite at the end, they came to a door in which were three locks. In the middle of the door, however, there was a little pane, through which they could see into the room. There they saw a little grey man, who was sitting at a table. They called him, once, twice, but he did not hear; at last they called him for the third time, when he got up, opened the locks, and came out. He said nothing, however, but conducted them to a handsomelyspread table, and when they had eaten and drunk, he took each of them to a bedroom. Next morning the little grey man came to the eldest, beckoned to him, and conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three tasks, by the performance of which the castle could be delivered. The first was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the princess's pearls, a thousand in number, which must be picked up, and if by sunset one single pearl was wanting, he who had looked for them would be turned into stone. The eldest went thither, and sought the whole day, but when it came to an end, he had only found one hundred, and what was written on the table came to pass, and he was changed into stone. Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure; it did not, however, fare much better with him than with the eldest; he did not find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone. At last the turn came to Simpleton also, who sought in the moss. It was, however, so hard to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated himself on a stone, and wept. And while he was thus sitting, the King of the ants whose life he had once saved, came with five thousand ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls together, and laid them in a heap. The second task, however, was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King's daughter's bed-chamber. When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he had saved, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of the water. But the third task was the most difficult; from amongst the three sleeping daughters of the King was the youngest and dearest to be sought out. They, however, resembled each other exactly, and were only to be distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats before they fell asleep; the eldest a bit of sugar; the second a little syrup; and the youngest a spoonful of honey.Then the Queen of the bees, which Simpleton had protected from the fire, came and tasted the lips of all three, and at last she remained sitting on the mouth which had eaten honey, and thus the King's son recognized the right princess. Then the enchantment was at an end; everything was released from sleep, and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural forms. Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest princess, and after her father's death became King, and his two brothers received the two other sisters.





The Wolf and the Man


Once on a time the fox was talking to the wolf of the strength of man; how no animal could withstand him, and how all were obliged to employ cunning in order to preserve themselves from him. Then the wolf answered,“If I had but the chance of seeing a man for once, I would set on him notwithstanding.”

“I can help you to do that,”said the fox.“Come to me early tomorrow morning, and I will show you one.”The wolf presented himself betimes, and the fox took him out on the road by which the huntsmen went daily. First came an old discharged soldier.“Is that a man?”inquired the wolf.

“No,”answered the fox,“that was one.”Afterwards came a little boy who was going to school.“Is that a man?”

“No, that is going to be one.”At length came a hunter with his double-barrelled gun at his back, and hanger by his side. Said the fox to the wolf,“Look, there comes a man, you must attack him, but I will take myself off to my hole.”The wolf then rushed on the man. When the huntsman saw him he said,“It is a pity that I have not loaded with a bullet,”aimed, and fired his small shot in his face. The wolf pulled a very wry face, but did not let himself be frightened, and attacked him again, on which the huntsman gave him the second barrel. The wolf swallowed his pain, and rushed on the huntsman, but he drew out his bright hanger, and gave him a few cuts with it right and left, so that, bleeding everywhere, he ran howling back to the fox.“Well, brother wolf,”said the fox,“how have you got on with man?”

“Ah!”replied the wolf,“I never imagined the strength of man to be what it is! First, he took a stick from his shoulder, and blew into it, and then something flew into my face which tickled me terribly; then he breathed once more into the stick, and it flew into my nose like lightning and hail; when I was quite close, he drew a white rib out of his side, and he beat me so with it that I was all but left lying dead.”

“See what a braggart you art!”said the fox.“You throw your hatchet so far that you can not fetch it back again!”





The Old Man and His Grandson


There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth. His son and his son's wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.

Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a few halfpence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground.“What are you doing there?”asked the father.“I am making a little trough,”answered the child,“for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.”

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything.





The Gold-Children


There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to mouth. But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold. As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and said,“Hark you, fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.”Then the fisherman answered,“Of what use is a castle to me, if I have nothing to eat?”The gold fish continued,“That shall be taken care of, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you can desire.”

“If that be true,”said the man,“then I can well do you a favour.”

“Yes,”said the fish,“there is, however, the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all will be over.”

Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water, and went home. But where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He opened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and said,“Husband, how has all this come to pass? It suits me very well.”

“Yes,”said the man,“it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just give me something to eat.”

Said the wife,“But I have got nothing and don't know where to find anything in this new house.”

“There is no need of your knowing,”said the man,“for I see yonder a great cupboard, just unlock it.”When she opened it, there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect. Then the woman cried joyfully,“What more can you want, my dear?”and they sat down, and ate and drank together. When they had had enough, the woman said,“But husband, whence come all these riches?”

“Alas,”answered he,“do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything; if I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune will fly.”

“Very good,”said she,“if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything.”However, she was not in earnest; she never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty. And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old fisherman's hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish. But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish.“Listen,”said the fish,“if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats; only be firm, for your life's sake don't reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!”

“I will take good care,”answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it. The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret. In an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut.“Now you have got what you want,”said he;“and we can gnaw at a bare bone again.”

“Ah,”said the woman,“I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no peace.”

The man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time.“Listen,”said the fish,“I see very well that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me into six pieces; give your wife two of them to eat, two to your horse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a blessing.”The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him. It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces that were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the horse had two golden foals, and the fisherman's wife bore two children who were made entirely of gold.

The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise. Then they said,“Father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel out in the world.”But he answered sorrowfully,“How shall I bear it if you go away, and I know not how it fares with you?”Then they said,“The two golden lilies remain here. By them you can see how it is with us; if they are fresh, then we are in health; if they are withered, we are ill; if they perish, then we are dead.”So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and when they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer. When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father. But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he was about to enter it, the people said, It is not safe for you to ride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly. You will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.'

But he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said,“I must and will ride through it.”Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest. When he had ridden onward a little he heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking together. From one side came cries of,“There is one,”but from the other,“Let him go, 'tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse, what should we gain from him?”So the gold-child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him.

One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she existed in the world. And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and said,“I love you with my whole heart, will you be my wife?”He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said,“Yes, I will be your wife, and be true to you my whole life long.”Then they were married, and just as they were in the greatest happiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that his daughter's wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said,“Where is the bridegroom?”They showed him the gold-child, who, however, still wore his bearskins. Then the father said wrathfully,“A vagabond shall never have my daughter!”and was about to kill him. Then the bride begged as hard as she could, and said,“He is my husband, and I love him with all my heart!”until at last he allowed himself to be appeased. Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter's husband was a common ragged beggar. But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the castoff bear-skins lying on the ground. Then he went back and thought,“What a good thing it was that I restrained my anger! I should have committed a great crime.”

But the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife,“I must go out hunting.”She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said,“You might easily meet with a great misfortune,”but he answered,“I must and will go.”Thereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not long before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream. He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away. He gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a witch. He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked,“What are you doing so late in the midst of the great forest?”

“Have you not seen a stag?”

“Yes,”answered she,“I know the stag well,”and thereupon a little dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently.“Will you be silent, you odious toad,”said he,“or I will shoot you dead.”Then the witch cried out in a passion,“What! will you slay my little dog?”and immediately transformed him, so that he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and thought,“That which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!”

But at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when one of them suddenly drooped.“Good heavens!”said he,“my brother has met with some great misfortune! I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.”Then the father said,“Stay here, if I lose you also, what shall I do?”But he answered,“I must and will go forth!”Then he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the great forest, where his brother lay turned to stone. The old witch came out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but he did not go near her, and said,“I will shoot you, if you will not bring my brother to life again.”She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to his human shape. But the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw each other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the forest, the one home to his bride, and the other to his father. The father then said,“I knew well that you had rescued your brother, for the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.”Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death.





The Poor Man and the Rich Man


In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn. Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other; the one large and beautiful, the other small and poor. The large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man.

Then the Lord thought,“I shall be no burden to the rich man, I will stay the night with him.”When the rich man heard some one knocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted. The Lord answered,“I only ask for a night's lodging.”

Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said,“No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself. Go somewhere else for a lodging,”and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there.

So the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked. He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in.“Pass the night with me, it is already dark,”said he;“you cannot go any further to-night.”This pleased the Lord, and he went in. The poor man's wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts. Then she put the potatoes on the fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat, that they might have a little milk with them. When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table. When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said,“Hark you, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary.”

“With all my heart,”he answered,“I will go and offer it to him;”and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly. But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks; however, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground. Next morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest. When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey. But as he was standing at the door he turned round and said,“As you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for yourselves and I will grant them.”Then the man said,“What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have.”And the Lord said to him,“Will you wish for a new house instead of this old one?”“Oh, yes,”said the man;“if I can have that, too, I should like it very much.”And the Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house into a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on.

The sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out of his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a new clean-looking house with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut used to be. He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her,“Tell me, what can have happened? Last night there was a miserable little hut standing there, and to-day there is a beautiful new house. Run over and see how that has come to pass.”So his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her,“Yesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a night's lodging, and this morning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes—-eternal happiness, health during this life and our daily bread as well, and besides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old hut.”When the rich man's wife heard this, she ran back in haste and told her husband how it had happened. The man said,“I could tear myself to pieces! If I had but known that! That traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep here, and I sent him away.”

“Quick!”said his wife,“get on your horse. You can still catch the man up, and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you.”The rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse, and soon came up with the Lord. He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him.“Yes,”said the Lord;“if I ever come back again, I will do so.”Then the rich man asked if he might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done?“Yes,”said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted. So the Lord said to him,“Ride home, then, and three wishes which you shall form, shall be fulfilled.”

The rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. As he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. He patted its neck, and said,“Gently, Lisa,”but the horse only began new tricks. Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently,“I wish your neck was broken!”Directly he had said the words, down the horse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never moved again. And thus was his first wish fulfilled. As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back;and now he had to go on foot.“I have still two wishes left,”said he, and comforted himself with that thought. And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry. The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for.“If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world,”said he to himself,“I should still to think of all kinds of other things later on, I know that, beforehand. But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards.”Then he sighed and said,“Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.”Many a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to him to be, after all, too little. Then it came into his mind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself. This really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said,“I just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back.”And as the last word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back, and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled. Then he really did feel warm. He began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home, to think of something really large for his last wish. But when he arrived there and opened the parlour-door,he saw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle, crying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it. So he said,“Do bear it, and I will wish for all the riches on earth for you, only stay where you are.”She, however, called him a fool, and said,“What good will all the riches on earth do me, if I am to sit on this saddle? You have wished me on it, so you must help me off.”So whether he would or not, he was forced to let his third wish be that she should be quit of the saddle, and able to get off it, and immediately the wish was fulfilled. So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death.





The Singing, Soaring Lark


There was once on a time a man who was about to set out on a long journey, and on parting he asked his three daughters what he should bring back with him for them. Whereupon the eldest wished for pearls, the second wished for diamonds, but the third said,“Dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark.”The father said,“Yes, if I can get it, you shall have it,”kissed all three, and set out. Now when the time had come for him to be on his way home again, he had brought pearls and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for a singing, soaring lark for the youngest, and he was very unhappy about it, for she was his favorite child. Then his road lay through a forest, and in the midst of it was a splendid castle, and near the castle stood a tree, but quite on the top of the tree, he saw a singing, soaring lark.“Aha, you come just at the right moment!”he said, quite delighted, and called to his servant to climb up and catch the little creature. But as he approached the tree, a lion leapt from beneath it, shook himself, and roared till the leaves on the trees trembled.“He who tries to steal my singing, soaring lark,”he cried,“will I devour.”Then the man said,“I did not know that the bird belonged to you. I will make amends for the wrong I have done and ransom myself with a large sum of money, only spare my life.”The lion said,“Nothing can save you, unless you will promise to give me for my own what first meets you on your return home;and if you will do that, I will grant you your life, and you shall have the bird for your daughter, into the bargain.”But the man hesitated and said,“That might be my youngest daughter, she loves me best, and always runs to meet me on my return home.”The servant, however, was terrified and said,“Why should your daughter be the very one to meet you, it might as easily be a cat, or dog?”Then the man allowed himself to be over-persuaded, took the singing, soaring lark, and promised to give the lion whatsoever should first meet him on his return home.

When he reached home and entered his house, the first who met him was no other than his youngest and dearest daughter, who came running up, kissed and embraced him, and when she saw that he had brought with him a singing, soaring lark, she was beside herself with joy. The father, however, could not rejoice, but began to weep, and said,“My dearest child, I have bought the little bird dear. In return for it, I have been obliged to promise you to a savage lion, and when he has you he will tear you in pieces and devour you,”and he told her all, just as it had happened, and begged her not to go there, come what might. But she consoled him and said,“Dearest father, indeed your promise must be fulfilled. I will go thither and soften the lion, so that I may return to you safely.”Next morning she had the road pointed out to her, took leave, and went fearlessly out into the forest. The lion, however, was an enchanted prince and was by day a lion, and all his people were lions with him, but in the night they resumed their natural human shapes. On her arrival she was kindly received and led into the castle. When night came, the lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was celebrated with great magnificence. They lived happily together, remained awake at night, and slept in the daytime. One day he came and said,“To-morrow there is a feast in your father's house, because your eldest sister is to be married, and if you are inclined to go there, my lions shall conduct you.”She said,“Yes, I should very much like to see my father again,”and went thither, accompanied by the lions. There was great joy when she arrived, for they had all believed that she had been torn in pieces by the lion, and had long ceased to live. But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was, remained with them while the wedding-feast lasted, and then went back again to the forest. When the second daughter was about to be married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion,“This time I will not be alone, you must come with me.”The lion, however, said that it was too dangerous for him, for if when there a ray from a burning candle fell on him, he would be changed into a dove, and for seven years long would have to fly about with the doves. She said,“Ah, but do come with me, I will take great care of you, and guard you from all light.”So they went away together, and took with them their little child as well. She had a chamber built there, so strong and thick that no ray could pierce through it; in this he was to shut himself up when the candles were lit for the wedding-feast. But the door was made of green wood which warped and left a little crack which no one noticed. The wedding was celebrated with magnificence, but when the procession with all its candles and torches came back from church, and passed by this apartment, a ray about the breadth of a hair fell on the King's son, and when this ray touched him, he was transformed in an instant, and when she came in and looked for him, she did not see him, but a white dove was sitting there. The dove said to her,“For seven years must I fly about the world, but at every seventh step that you take I will let fall a drop of red blood and a white feather, and these will show you the way, and if you follow the trace you can release me.”

Thereupon the dove flew out at the door, and she followed him, and at every seventh step a red drop of blood and a little white feather fell down and showed her the way. So she went continually further and further in the wide world, never looking about her or resting, and the seven years were almost past; then she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered, and yet they were so far from it! Once when they were thus moving onwards, no little feather and no drop of red blood fell, and when she raised her eyes the dove had disappeared. And as she thought to herself,“In this no man can help you,”she climbed up to the sun, and said to him,“You shin into every crevice, and over every peak, have you not seen a white dove flying?”

“No,”said the sun,“I have seen none, but I present you with a casket, open it when you are in sorest need.”Then she thanked the sun, and went on until evening came and the moon appeared; she then asked her,“You shine the whole night through, and on every field and forest, have you not seen a white dove flying?”

“No,”said the moon,“I have seen no dove, but here I give you an egg, break it when you are in great need.”She thanked the moon, and went on until the night wind came up and blew on her, then she said to it,“You blow over every tree and under every leaf, have you not seen a white dove flying?”“No,”said the night wind,“I have seen none, but I will ask the three other winds, perhaps they have seen it.”The east wind and the west wind came, and had seen nothing, but the south wind said,“I have seen the white dove, it has flown to the Red Sea, where it has become a lion again, for the seven years are over, and the lion is there fighting with a dragon; the dragon, however, is an enchanted princess.”The night wind then said to her,“I will advise you; go to the Red Sea, on the right bank are some tall reeds, count them, break off the eleventh, and strike the dragon with it, then the lion will be able to subdue it, and both then will regain their human form. After that, look round and you will see the griffin which is by the Red Sea; swing yourself, with your beloved, on to his back, and the bird will carry you over the sea to your own home. Here is a nut for you, when you are above the center of the sea, let the nut fall, it will immediately shoot up, and a tall nut-tree will grow out of the water on which the griffin may rest; for if he cannot rest, he will not be strong enough to carry you across, and if you forget to throw down the nut, he will let you fall into the sea.”

Then she went thither, and found everything as the night wind had said. She counted the reeds by the sea, and cut off the eleventh, struck the dragon therewith, whereupon the lion overcame it, and immediately both of them regained their human shapes. But when the princess, who had before been the dragon, was delivered from enchantment, she took the youth by the arm, seated herself on the griffin, and carried him off with her. There stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was again forsaken. She sat down and cried, but at last she took courage and said,“Still I will go as far as the wind blows and as long as the cock crows, until I find him,”and she went forth by long, long roads, until at last she came to the castle where both of them were living together; there she heard that soon a feast was to be held, in which they would celebrate their wedding, but she said,“God still helps me,”and opened the casket that the sun had given her. A dress lay therein as brilliant as the sun itself. So she took it out and put it on, and went up into the castle, and everyone, even the bride herself, looked at her with astonishment. The dress pleased the bride so well that she thought it might do for her wedding-dress, and asked if it was for sale?“Not for money or land,”answered she,“but for flesh and blood.”The bride asked her what she meant by that, so she said,“Let me sleep a night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.”The bride would not, yet wanted very much to have the dress; at last she consented, but the page was to give the prince a sleeping-draught. When it was night, therefore, and the youth was already asleep, she was led into the chamber; she seated herself on the bed and said,“I have followed after you for seven years. I have been to the sun and the moon, and the four winds, and have enquired for you, and have helped you against the dragon; will you, then quite forget me?”But the prince slept so soundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling outside in the fir-trees. When therefore day broke, she was led out again, and had to give up the golden dress. And as that even had been of no avail, she was sad, went out into a meadow, sat down there, and wept. While she was sitting there, she thought of the egg which the moon had given her; she opened it, and there came out a clucking hen with twelve chickens all of gold, and they ran about chirping, and crept again under the old hen's wings; nothing more beautiful was ever seen in the world! Then she arose, and drove them through the meadow before her, until the bride looked out of the window. The little chickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale.“Not for money or land, but for flesh and blood; let me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps.”The bride said,“Yes,”intending to cheat her as on the former evening. But when the prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been? On this the page told all; that he had been forced to give him a sleepingdraught, because a poor girl had slept secretly in the chamber, and that he was to give him another that night. The prince said,“Pour out the draught by the bed-side.”At night, she was again led in, and when she began to relate how ill all had fared with her, he immediately recognized his beloved wife by her voice, sprang up and cried,“Now I really am released! I have been as it were in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me so that I have been compelled to forget you, but God has delivered me from the spell at the right time.”Then they both left the castle secretly in the night, for they feared the father of the princess, who was a sorcerer, and they seated themselves on the griffin which bore them across the Red Sea, and when they were in the midst of it, she let fall the nut. Immediately a tall nut-tree grew up, whereon the bird rested, and then carried them home, where they found their child, who had grown tall and beautiful, and they lived thenceforth happily until their death.





The Goose-Girl


There was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter. When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance. When the time came for her to be married, and she had to journey forth into the distant kingdom, the aged Queen packed up for her many costly vessels of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver; and cups and jewels, in short, everything which appertained to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart. She likewise sent her maid in waiting, who was to ride with her, and hand her over to the bridegroom, and each had a horse for the journey, but the horse of the King's daughter was called Falada, and could speak. So when the hour of parting had come, the aged mother went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her finger with it until it bled, then she held a white handkerchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall, gave it to her daughter and said,“Dear child, preserve this carefully, it will be of service to you on your way.”

So they took a sorrowful leave of each other; the princess put the piece of cloth in her bosom, mounted her horse, and then went away to her bridegroom. After she had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said to her waiting-maid,“Dismount, and take my cup which you have brought with you for me, and get me some water from the stream, for I should like to drink.”“If you are thirsty,”said the waiting-maid,“get off your horse yourself, and lie down and drink out of the water, I don't choose to be your servant.”So in her great thirst the princess alighted, bent down over the water in the stream and drank, and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup. Then she said,“Ah, Heaven!”and the three drops of blood answered,“If your mother knew, her heart would break.”But the King's daughter was humble, said nothing, and mounted her horse again. She rode some miles further, but the day was warm, the sun scorched her, and she was thirsty once more, and when they came to a stream of water, she again cried to her waiting-maid,“Dismount, and give me some water in my golden cup,”for she had long ago forgotten the girl's ill words. But the waiting-maid said still more haughtily,“If you wish to drink, drink as you can, I don't choose to be your maid.”Then in her great thirst the King's daughter alighted, bent over the flowing stream, wept and said,“Ah, Heaven!”and the drops of blood again replied,“If your mother knew this, her heart would break.”And as she was thus drinking and leaning right over the stream, the handkerchief with the three drops of blood fell out of her bosom, and floated away with the water without her observing it, so great was her trouble. The waiting-maid, however, had seen it, and she rejoiced to think that she had now power over the bride, for since the princess had lost the drops of blood, she had become weak and powerless. So now when she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, the waiting-maid said,“Falada is more suitable for me, and my nag will do for you”and the princess had to be content with that. Then the waiting-maid, with many hard words, bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own shabby clothes; and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear sky above her, that she would not say one word of this to any one at the royal court, and if she had not taken this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada saw all this, and observed it well.

The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the true bride the bad horse, and thus they traveled onwards, until at length they entered the royal palace. There were great rejoicings over her arrival, and the prince sprang forward to meet her, lifted the waiting-maid from her horse, and thought she was his consort. She was conducted upstairs, but the real princess was left standing below. Then the old King looked out of the window and saw her standing in the courtyard, and how dainty and delicate and beautiful she was, and instantly went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard, and who she was?“I picked her up on my way for a companion; give the girl something to work at, that she may not stand idle.”But the old King had no work for her, and knew of none, so he said,“I have a little boy who tends the geese, she may help him.”The boy was called Conrad, and the true bride had to help him to tend the geese.

Soon afterwards the false bride said to the young King,“Dearest husband, I beg you to do me a favour.”He answered,“I will do so most willingly.”

“Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse on which I rode here cut off, for it vexed me on the way.”In reality, she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved to the King's daughter. Then she succeeded in making the King promise that it should be done, and the faithful Falada was to die; this came to the ears of the real princess, and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her. There was a great darklooking gateway in the town, through which morning and evening she had to pass with the geese: would he be so good as to nail up Falada's head on it, so that she might see him again, more than once. The knacker's man promised to do that, and cut off the head, and nailed it fast beneath the dark gateway.

Early in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath this gateway, she said in passing,





“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”





Then the head answered,





“Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!

If this your tender mother knew,

Her heart would surely break in two.”





Then they went still further out of the town, and drove their geese into the country. And when they had come to the meadow, she sat down and unbound her hair which was like pure gold, and Conrad saw it and delighted in its brightness, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs. Then she said,





“Blow, blow, you gentle wind, I say,

Blow Conrad's little hat away,

And make him chase it here and there,

Until I have braided all my hair,

And bound it up again.”





And there came such a violent wind that it blew Conrad's hat far away across country, and he was forced to run after it. When he came back she had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again, and he could not get any of it. Then Conrad was angry, and would not speak to her, and thus they watched the geese until the evening, and then they went home.

Next day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway, the maiden said,





“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”





Falada answered,





“Alas, young Queen, how ill you fare!

If this your tender mother knew,

Her heart would surely break in two.”





And she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair, and Conrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste,





“Blow, blow, you gentle wind, I say,

Blow Conrad's little hat away,

And make him chase it here and there,

Until I have braided all my hair,

And bound it up again.”





Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away, and Conrad was forced to run after it, and when he came back, her hair had been put up a long time, and he could get none of it, and so they looked after their geese till evening came.

But in the evening after they had got home, Conrad went to the old King, and said,“I won't tend the geese with that girl any longer!”

“Why not?”inquired the aged King.

“Oh, because she vexes me the whole day long.”Then the aged King commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him. And Conrad said,“In the morning when we pass beneath the dark gateway with the flock, there is a sorry horse's head on the wall, and she says to it,





“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”





And the head replies,





“Alas, young Queen how ill you fare!

If this your tender mother knew,

Her heart would surely break in two.”





And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture, and how when there he had to chase his hat.

The aged King commanded him to drive his flock out again next day, and as soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gateway, and heard how the maiden spoke to the head of Falada, and then he too went into the country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow. There he soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringing their flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair, which shone with radiance. And soon she said,





“Blow, blow, you gentle wind, I say,

Blow Conrad's little hat away,

And make him chase it here and there,

Until I have braided all my hair,

And bound it up again.”





Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad's hat, so that he had to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting her hair, all of which the King observed. Then, quite unseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home in the evening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these things.“I may not tell you that, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human being, for I have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me; if I had not done that, I should have lost my life.”He urged her and left her no peace, but he could draw nothing from her. Then said he,“If you will not tell me anything, tell your sorrows to the iron-stove there,”and he went away. Then she crept into the iron-stove, and began to weep and lament, and emptied her whole heart, and said,“Here am I deserted by the whole world, and yet I am a King's daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by force brought me to such a pass that I have been compelled to put off my royal apparel, and she has taken my place with my bridegroom, and I have to perform menial service as a goose-girl. If my mother knew that, her heart would break.”The aged King, however, was standing outside by the pipe of the stove, and was listening to what she said, and heard it. Then he came back again, and bade her come out of the stove. And royal garments were placed on her, and it was marvellous how beautiful she was! The aged King summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the false bride who was only a waitingmaid, but that the true one was standing there, as the sometime goose-girl. The young King rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and youth, and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends were invited. At the head of the table sat the bridegroom with the King's daughter at one side of him, and the waiting-maid on the other, but the waiting-maid was blinded, and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array. When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the aged King asked the waiting-maid as a riddle, what a person deserved who had behaved in such and such a way to her master, and at the same time related the whole story, and asked what sentence such an one merited? Then the false bride said,“She deserves no better fate than to be stripped entirely naked, and put in a barrel which is studded inside with pointed nails, and two white horses should be harnessed to it, which will drag her along through one street after another, till she is dead.”“It is you,”said the aged King,“and you have pronounced your own sentence, and thus shall it be done unto you.”And when the sentence had been carried out, the young King married his true bride, and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness.





The King of the Golden Mountain


There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl;they were both young, and could not walk. And two richly-laden ships of his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just as he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they had gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town. In order to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went out to this field, and as he was walking forwards and backwards in it, a little black mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so sad, and what he was taking so much to heart. Then said the merchant,“If you could help me I would willingly tell you.”

“Who knows?”replied the black dwarf.“Perhaps, I can help you.”Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field.“Do not trouble yourself,”said the dwarf.“If you will promise to give me the first thing that rubs itself against your leg when you are at home again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years' time, you shall have as much money as you will.”The merchant thought,“What can that be but my dog?”and did not remember his little boy, so he said yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went home.

When he reached home, his little boy was so delighted that he held by a bench, tottered up to him and seized him fast by the legs. The father was shocked, for he remembered his promise, and now knew what he had pledged himself to do; as however, he still found no money in his chest, he thought the dwarf had only been jesting. A month afterwards he went up to the garret, intending to gather together some old tin and to sell it, and saw a great heap of money lying. Then he was happy again, made purchases, became a greater merchant than before, and felt that this world was well-governed. In the meantime the boy grew tall, and at the same time sharp and clever. But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious grew the merchant, so that his distress might be seen in his face. One day his son asked what ailed him, but the father would not say. The boy, however, persisted so long, that at last he told him that without being aware of what he was doing, he had promised him to a black dwarf, and had received much money for doing so. He said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this, and that now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up. Then said the son,“Oh, father, do not be uneasy, all will go well. The black man has no power over me.”

The son had himself blessed by the priest, and when the time came, father and son went together to the field, and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it with his father. Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man,“Have you brought with you that which you have promised me?”He was silent, but the son asked,“What do you want here?”Then said the black dwarf,“I have to speak with your father, and not with you.”The son replied,“You have betrayed and misled my father, give back the writing.”

“No,”said the black dwarf,“I will not give up my rights.”They spoke together for a long time after this, but at last they agreed that the son, as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind, nor yet to his father, should seat himself in a small boat, which should lie on water which was flowing away from them, and that the father should push it off with his own foot, and then the son should remain given up to the water. So he took leave of his father, placed himself in a little boat, and the father had to push it off with his own foot. The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost, and the father believed his son was lost, and went home and mourned for him.

The boat, however, did not sink, but floated quietly away, and the boy sat safely inside it, and it floated thus for a long time, until at last it stopped by an unknown shore. Then he landed and saw a beautiful castle before him, and set out to go to it. But when he entered it, he found that it was bewitched. He went through every room, but all were empty until he reached the last, where a snake lay coiled in a ring. The snake, however, was an enchanted maiden, who rejoiced to see him, and said,“Have you come, oh, my deliverer? I have already waited twelve years for you; this kingdom is bewitched, and you must set it free.”

“How can I do that?”he inquired.

“To-night come twelve black men, covered with chains who will ask what you are doing here; keep silent; give them no answer, and let them do what they will with you; they will torment you, beat you, stab you; let everything pass, only do not speak; at twelve o'clock, they must go away again. On the second night twelve others will come; on the third, four-and-twenty, who will cut off your head, but at twelve o'clock their power will be over, and then if you have endured all, and have not spoken the slightest word, I shall be released. I will come to you, and will have, in a bottle, some of the water of life. I will rub you with that, and then you will come to life again, and be as healthy as before.”Then said he,“I will gladly set you free.”And everything happened just as she had said; the black men could not force a single word from him, and on the third night the snake became a beautiful princess, who came with the water of life and brought him back to life again. So she threw herself into his arms and kissed him, and there was joy and gladness in the whole castle. After this their marriage was celebrated, and he was King of the Golden Mountain.

They lived very happily together, and the Queen bore a fine boy. Eight years had already gone by, when the King bethought him of his father; his heart was moved, and he wished to visit him. The Queen, however, would not let him go away, and said,“I know beforehand that it will cause my unhappiness;”but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented. At their parting she gave him a wishing-ring, and said,“Take this ring and put it on your finger, and then you will immediately be transported whithersoever you wouldst be, only you must promise me not to use it in wishing me away from this place and with your father.”That he promised her, put the ring on his finger, and wished himself at home, just outside the town where his father lived. Instantly he found himself there, and made for the town, but when he came to the gate, the sentries would not let him in, because he wore such strange and yet such rich and magnificent clothing. Then he went to a hill where a shepherd was watching his sheep, changed clothes with him, put on his old shepherd'scoat, and then entered the town without hindrance. When he came to his father, he made himself known to him, but he did not at all believe that the shepherd was his son, and said he certainly had had a son, but that he was dead long ago; however, as he saw he was a poor, needy shepherd, he would give him something to eat. Then the shepherd said to his parents,“I am verily your son. Do you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me?”

“Yes,”said his mother,“our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm.”He slipped back his shirt, and they saw the raspberry under his right arm, and no longer doubted that he was their son. Then he told them that he was King of the Golden Mountain, and a king's daughter was his wife, and that they had a fine son of seven years old. Then said the father,“That is certainly not true; it is a fine kind of a king who goes about in a ragged shepherd's-coat.”On this the son fell in a passion, and without thinking of his promise, turned his ring round, and wished both his wife and child with him. They were there in a second, but the Queen wept, and reproached him, and said that he had broken his word, and had brought misfortune upon her. He said,“I have done it thoughtlessly, and not with evil intention,”and tried to calm her, and she pretended to believe this;but she had mischief in her mind.

Then he led her out of the town into the field, and showed her the stream where the little boat had been pushed off, and then he said,“I am tired; sit down, I will sleep awhile on your lap.”And he laid his head on her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she first drew the ring from his finger, then she drew away the foot which was under him, leaving only the slipper behind her, and she took her child in her arms, and wished herself back in her own kingdom. When he awoke, there he lay quite deserted, and his wife and child were gone, and so was the ring from his finger, the slipper only was still there as a token.“Home to your parents you can not return,”thought he,“they would say that you were a wizard;you must be off, and walk on until you arrive in your own kingdom.”So he went away and came at length to a hill by which three giants were standing, disputing with each other because they did not know how to divide their father's property. When they saw him passing by, they called to him and said little men had quick wits, and that he was to divide their inheritance for them. The inheritance, however, consisted of a sword, which had this property that if any one took it in his hand, and said,“All heads off but mine,”every head would lie on the ground; secondly, of a cloak which made any one who put it on invisible; thirdly, of a pair of boots which could transport the wearer to any place he wished in a moment. He said,“Give me the three things that I may see if they are still in good condition.”They gave him the cloak, and when he had put it on, he was invisible and changed into a fly. Then he resumed his own form and said,“The cloak is a good one, now give me the sword.”They said,“No, we will not give you that; if you were to say, All heads off but mine, all our heads would be off, and you alone would be left with yours.”Nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was only to try it against a tree. This he did, and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw. Then he wanted to have the boots likewise, but they said,“No, we will not give them; if you had them on your feet and were to wish yourself at the top of the hill, we should be left down here with nothing.”

“Oh, no,”said he,“I will not do that.”So they gave him the boots as well. And now when he had got all these things, he thought of nothing but his wife and his child, and said as though to himself,“Oh, if I were but on the Golden Mountain,”and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the giants, and thus their inheritance was divided. When he was near his palace, he heard sounds of joy, and fiddles, and flutes, and the people told him that his wife was celebrating her wedding with another. Then he fell into a rage, and said,“False woman, she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep!”So he put on his cloak, and unseen by all went into the palace. When he entered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food, and the guests were eating and drinking, and laughing, and jesting. She sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel, with a crown on her head. He placed himself behind her, and no one saw him. When she put a piece of meat on a plate for herself, he took it away and ate it, and when she poured out a glass of wine for herself, he took it away and drank it. She was always helping herself to something, and yet she never got anything, for plate and glass disappeared immediately. Then dismayed and ashamed, she arose and went to her chamber and wept, but he followed her there. She said,“Has the devil power over me, or did my deliverer never come?”Then he struck her in the face, and said,“Did your deliverer never come? It is he who has you in his power, you traitor. Have I deserved this from you?”Then he made himself visible, went into the hall, and cried,“The wedding is at an end,the true King has returned.”The kings, princes, and councillors who were assembled there, ridiculed and mocked him, but he did not trouble to answer them, and said,“Will you go away, or not?”On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him, but he drew his sword and said,“All heads off but mine,”and all the heads rolled on the ground, and he alone was master, and once more King of the Golden Mountain.





The Raven


There was once upon a time a Queen who had a little daughter who was still so young that she had to be carried. One day the child was naughty, and the mother might say what she liked, but the child would not be quiet. Then she became impatient, and as the ravens were flying about the palace, she opened the window and said,“I wish you were a raven and would fly away, and then I should have some rest.”Scarcely had she spoken the words, before the child was changed into a raven, and flew from her arms out of the window. It flew into a dark forest, and stayed in it a long time, and the parents heard nothing of their child. Then one day a man was on his way through this forest and heard the raven crying, and followed the voice, and when he came nearer, the bird said,“I am a king's daughter by birth, and am bewitched, but you can set me free.”

“What am I to do,”asked he. She said,“Go further into the forest, and you will find a house, wherein sits an aged woman, who will offer you meat and drink, but you must accept nothing, for if you eat and drink anything, you will fall into a sleep, and then you will not be able to deliver me. In the garden behind the house there is a great heap of tan, and on this you shall stand and wait for me. For three days I will come every afternoon at two o'clock in a carriage. On the first day four white horses will be harnessed to it, then four chestnut horses, and lastly four black ones; but if you are not awake, but sleeping, I shall not be set free.”The man promised to do everything that she desired, but the raven said,“Alas,I know already that you will not deliver me; you will accept something from the woman.”Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink. But when he entered the house the old woman came to him and said,“Poor man, how faint you are; come and refresh yourself; eat and drink.”

“No,”said the man,“I will not eat or drink.”She, however, let him have no peace, and said,“If you will not eat, take one drink out of the glass; one is nothing.”Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank. Shortly before two o'clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven. As he was standing there, his weariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle against it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined not to go to sleep. Hardly, however, had he lain down, than his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him. At two o'clock the raven came driving up with four white horses, but she was already in deep grief and said,“I know he is asleep.”And when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan. She alighted from the carriage, went to him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake. Next day about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he would not take any of it. But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass. Towards two o'clock he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him. He could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell into a heavy sleep. When the raven drove up with four brown horses, she was already full of grief, and said,“I know he is asleep.”She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was no wakening him. Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this? He was neither eating nor drinking anything; did he want to die? He replied,“I am not allowed to eat or drink, and will not do so.”But she set a dish with food, and a glass with wine before him, and when he smelt it he could not resist, and swallowed a deep draught. When the time came, he went out into the garden to the heap of tan, and waited for the King's daughter; but he became still more weary than on the day before, and lay down and slept as soundly as if he had been a stone. At two o'clock the raven came with four black horses, and the coachman and everything else was black. She was already in the deepest grief, and said,“I know that he is asleep and cannot deliver me.”When she came to him, there he was lying fast asleep. She shook him and called him, but she could not waken him. Then she laid a loaf beside him, and after that a piece of meat, and thirdly a bottle of wine, and he might consume as much of all of them as he liked, but they would never grow less. After this she took a gold ring from her finger, and put it on his, and her name was graven on it. Lastly, she laid a letter beside him wherein was written what she had given him, and that none of the things would ever grow less; and in it was also written,“I see right well that here you will never be able to deliver me, but if you are still willing to deliver me, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; it lies in your power, of that I am certain.”And when she had given him all these things, she seated herself in her carriage, and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.

When the man awoke and saw that he had slept, he was sad at heart, and said,“She has certainly driven by, and I have not set her free.”Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him, and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened. So he arose and went away, intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was. After he had walked about the world for a long time, he entered into a dark forest, and walked for fourteen days, and still could not find his way out. Then it was once more evening, and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep. Next day he went onwards, and in the evening, as he was again about to lie down beneath some bushes, he heard such a howling and crying that he could not go to sleep. And at the time when people light the candles, he saw one glimmering, and arose and went towards it. Then he came to a house which seemed very small, for in front of it a great giant was standing. He thought to himself,“If I go in, and the giant sees me, it will very likely cost me my life.”At length he ventured it and went in. When the giant saw him, he said,“It is well that you come, for it is long since I have eaten; I will at once eat you for my supper.”

“I'd rather you would leave that alone,”said the man,“I do not like to be eaten; but if you have any desire to eat, I have quite enough here to satisfy you.”

“If that be true,”said the giant,“you mayst be easy, I was only going to devour you because I had nothing else.”Then they went, and sat down to the table, and the man took out the bread, wine, and meat which would never come to an end.“This pleases me well,”said the giant, and ate to his heart's content. Then the man said to him,“Can you tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is?”The giant said,“I will look at my map;all the towns, and villages, and houses are to be found on it.”He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle, but it was not to be found on it.“It's no matter!”said he,“I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs, and we will look in them.”But there, too, it was in vain. The man now wanted to go onwards, but the giant begged him to wait a few days longer until his brother, who had gone out to bring some provisions, came home. When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg. He replied,“When I have eaten and have had enough, I will look on the map.”Then he went with them up to his chamber, and they searched in his map, but could not find it. Then he brought out still older maps, and they never rested until they found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away.“How am I to get there?”asked the man. The giant said,“I have two hours' time,during which I will carry you into the neighbourhood, but after that I must be at home to suckle the child that we have.”So the giant carried the man to about a hundred leagues from the castle, and said,“You can very well walk the rest of the way alone.”And he turned back, but the man went onwards day and night, until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg. It stood on a glass-mountain, and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle, and then went inside it. He rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her, but when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again. And when he saw that he could not reach her, he was filled with trouble, and said to himself,“I will stay down here below, and wait for her.”So he built himself a hut and stayed in it for a whole year, and every day saw the King's daughter driving about above, but never could go to her.

Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other, and cried to them,“God be with you!”They stopped when they heard the cry, but as they saw no one, they once more began to beat each other, and that too most dangerously. So he again cried,“God be with you!”Again they stopped, looked round about, but as they saw no one they went on beating each other. Then he cried for the third time,“God be with you,”and thought,“I must see what these three are about,”and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously. One of them said that he found a stick, and that when he struck a door with it, that door would spring open. The next said that he had found a mantle, and that whenever he put it on, he was invisible, but the third said he had found a horse on which a man could ride everywhere, even up the glass-mountain. And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common, or whether they ought to divide them. Then the man said,“I will give you something in exchange for these three things. Money indeed have I not, but I have other things of more value; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth.”Then they put him on the horse, threw the mantle round him, and gave him the stick in his hand, and when he had all these things they were no longer able to see him. So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried,“Now, vagabonds, you have got what you deserve, are you satisfied?”And he rode up the glassmountain, but when he came in front of the castle at the top, it was shut. Then he struck the door with his stick, and it sprang open immediately. He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her. She, however, could not see him because he had the mantle on. And when he came up to her, he drew from his finger the ring which she had given him, and threw it into the cup so that it rang. Then she cried,“That is my ring, so the man who is to set me free must be here.”They searched the whole castle and did not find him, but he had gone out, and had seated himself on the horse and thrown off the mantle. When they came to the door, they saw him and cried aloud in their delight. Then he alighted and took the King's daughter in his arms, but she kissed him and said,“Now have you set me free, and to-morrow we will celebrate our wedding.”





The Peasant's Wise Daughter


There was once a poor peasant who had no land, but only a small house, and one daughter. Then said the daughter,“We ought to ask our lord the King for a bit of newly-cleared land.”When the King heard of their poverty, he presented them with a piece of land, which she and her father dug up, and intended to sow with a little corn and grain of that kind. When they had dug nearly the whole of the field, they found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold.“Listen,”said the father to the girl,“as our lord the King has been so gracious and presented us with the field, we ought to give him this mortar in return for it.”The daughter, however, would not consent to this, and said,“Father, if we have the mortar without having the pestle as well, we shall have to get the pestle, so you had much better say nothing about it.”He would, however, not obey her, but took the mortar and carried it to the King, said that he had found it in the cleared land, and asked if he would accept it as a present. The King took the mortar, and asked if he had found nothing besides that?“No,”answered the countryman. Then the King said that he must now bring him the pestle. The peasant said they had not found that, but he might just as well have spoken to the wind; he was put in prison, and was to stay there until he produced the pestle. The servants had daily to carry him bread and water, which is what people get in prison, and they heard how the man cried out continually,“Ah! if I had but listened to my daughter! Alas, alas, if I had but listened to my daughter!”and would neither eat nor drink. So he commanded the servants to bring the prisoner before him, and then the King asked the peasant why he was always crying,“Ah! if I had but listened to my daughter!”and what it was that his daughter had said.

“She told me that I ought not to take the mortar to you, for I should have to produce the pestle as well.”

“If you have a daughter who is as wise as that, let her come here.”She was therefore obliged to appear before the King, who asked her if she really was so wise, and said he would set her a riddle, and if she could guess that, he would marry her. She at once said yes, she would guess it. Then said the King,“Come to me not clothed, not naked, not riding, not walking, not in the road, and not out of the road, and if you can do that I will marry you.”So she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not clothed, and took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and wrapped it entirely round and round her, so that she was not naked, and she hired an ass, and tied the fisherman's net to its tail, so that it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding nor walking. The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only touched the ground with her great toe, and that was neither being in the road nor out of the road. And when she arrived in that fashion, the King said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the conditions. Then he ordered her father to be released from the prison, took her to wife, and gave into her care all the royal possessions.

Now when some years had passed, the King was once drawing up his troops on parade, when it happened that some peasants who had been selling wood stopped with their waggons before the palace; some of them had oxen yoked to them, and some horses. There was one peasant who had three horses, one of which was delivered of a young foal, and it ran away and lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon. When the peasants came together, they began to dispute, to beat each other and make a disturbance, and the peasant with the oxen wanted to keep the foal, and said one of the oxen had given birth to it, and the other said his horse had had it, and that it was his. The quarrel came before the King, and he gave the verdict that the foal should stay where it had been found, and so the peasant with the oxen, to whom it did not belong, got it. Then the other went away, and wept and lamented over his foal. Now he had heard how gracious his lady the Queen was because she herself had sprung from poor peasant folks, so he went to her and begged her to see if she could not help him to get his foal back again. Said she,“Yes, I will tell you what to do, if you will promise me not to betray me. Early to-morrow morning, when the King parades the guard, place yourself there in the middle of the road by which he must pass, take a great fishing-net and pretend to be fishing; go on fishing, too, and empty out the net as if you had got it full”and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King. The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground. When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about? He answered,“I am fishing.”The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there? The peasant said,“It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.”The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was? The peasant must confess this at once. The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should! the idea was his own. They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen.

When the King reached home again, he said to his wife,“Why have you behaved so falsely to me? I will not have you any longer for a wife;your time is up, go back to the place from whence you came to your peasant's hut.”One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed. She said,“Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,”and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him. Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little. He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house. She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said,“Good God! where am I?”He called his attendants, but none of them were there. At length his wife came to his bedside and said,“My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.”Tears rose to the King's eyes and he said,“Dear wife, you shall be mine and I will be yours,”and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living.





The Three Little Birds


About a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the Keuterberg was very fond of hunting. Once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the King with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls,“If I do not get that one, I will have none.”Then the second girl answered from the other side of the hill, and pointed to the one who was on the King's right hand,“Hilloa! hilloa! If I do not get him, I will have no one.”These, however, were the two ministers. The King heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. This they would not tell him, so the King asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? Then she said,“Yes,”and the two ministers married the two sisters, for they were all three fair and beautiful of face, especially the Queen, who had hair like flax.

But the two sisters had no children, and once when the King was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the Queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. She had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. Then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. When they had thrown him in (I believe it was into the Weser) a little bird flew up into the air, which sang,





“To your death are you sped,

Until God's word be said.

In the white lily bloom,

Brave boy, is your tomb.”





When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said,“What God does, is well done!”

But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,





“To your death are you sped,

Until God's word be said.

In the white lily bloom,

Brave boy, is your tomb.”





And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said,“What God does, is well done.”The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him.

Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,





“To your death are you sped

Until God's word be said.

In the white lily bloom,

Bonny girl, is your tomb.”





And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years.

In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said,“Go your way, foundling.”

Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing.“Good day, mother,”said the boy.

“Many thanks,”said she.

“You will fish long enough before you catch anything.”

“And you will seek long enough before you find your father. How will you get over the water?”said the woman.

“God knows.”Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father. When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman,“Good day, mother.”

“Many thanks,”replied the old woman.

“May God help you with your fishing,”said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her,“Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.”The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall.

But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music. The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said,“Who has given you leave to hunt here?”

“Oh, no one.”

“To whom do you belong, then?”

“I am the fisherman's son.”

“But he has no children.”

“If you will not believe, come with me.”

That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,





“The mother sits alone

There in the prison small,

O King of royal blood,

These are your children all.

The sisters twain so false,

They wrought the children woe,

There in the waters deep

Where the fishermen come and go.”





Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince.





The Water of Life


There was once a King who had an illness, and no one believed that he would come out of it with his life. He had three sons who were much distressed about it, and went down into the palace-garden and wept. There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief. They told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly die, for nothing seemed to cure him. Then the old man said,“I know of one more remedy, and that is the water of life; if he drinks of it he will become well again; but it is hard to find.”The eldest said,“I will manage to find it,”and went to the sick King, and begged to be allowed to go forth in search of the water of life, for that alone could save him.“No,”said the King,“the danger of it is too great. I would rather die.”But he begged so long that the King consented. The prince thought in his heart,“If I bring the water, then I shall be best beloved of my father, and shall inherit the kingdom.”

So he set out, and when he had ridden forth a little distance, a dwarf stood there in the road who called to him and said,“Whither away so fast?”

“Silly shrimp,”said the prince, very haughtily,“it is nothing to do with you,”and rode on. But the little dwarf had grown angry, and had wished an evil wish. Soon after this the prince entered a ravine, and the further he rode the closer the mountains drew together, and at last the road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further; it was impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the saddle, and he was shut in there as if in prison. The sick King waited long for him, but he came not. Then the second son said,“Father, let me go forth to seek the water,”and thought to himself,“If my brother is dead, then the kingdom will fall to me.”At first the King would not allow him to go either, but at last he yielded, so the prince set out on the same road that his brother had taken, and he too met the dwarf, who stopped him to ask, whither he was going in such haste?“Little shrimp,”said the prince,“that is nothing to you,”and rode on without giving him another look. But the dwarf bewitched him, and he, like the other, rode into a ravine, and could neither go forwards nor backwards. So fare haughty people.

As the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be allowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the King was obliged to let him go. When he met the dwarf and the latter asked him whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an explanation, and said,“I am seeking the water of life, for my father is sick unto death.”

“Do you know, then, where that is to be found?”

“No,”said the prince.

“As you have borne yourself as is seemly, and not haughtily like your false brothers, I will give you the information and tell you how you may obtain the water of life. It springs from a fountain in the courtyard of an enchanted castle, but you will not be able to make your way to it, if I do not give you an iron wand and two small loaves of bread. Strike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the castle and it will spring open:inside lie two lions with gaping jaws, but if you throw a loaf to each of them, they will be quieted. Then hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve, else the door will shut again, and you will be imprisoned.”The prince thanked him, took the wand and the bread, and set out on his way. When he arrived, everything was as the dwarf had said. The door sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had appeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to a large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose rings he drew off their fingers. A sword and a loaf of bread were lying there, which he carried away. After this, he entered a chamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw him, kissed him, and told him that he had delivered her, and should have the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year their wedding should be celebrated;likewise she told him where the spring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw some of it before the clock struck twelve. Then he went onwards, and at last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed, and as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little. So he lay down and fell asleep. When he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve. He sprang up in a fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood near, and hastened away. But just as he was passing through the iron door, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such violence that it carried away a piece of his heel.

He, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went homewards, and again passed the dwarf. When the latter saw the sword and the loaf, he said,“With these you have won great wealth; with the sword you can slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to an end.”But the prince would not go home to his father without his brothers, and said,“Dear dwarf, can you not tell me where my two brothers are? They went out before I did in search of the water of life, and have not returned.”

“They are imprisoned between two mountains,”said the dwarf.“I have condemned them to stay there, because they were so haughty.”Then the prince begged until the dwarf released them; but he warned him, however, and said,“Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.”

When his brothers came, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that he had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with him, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a year for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he would obtain a great kingdom. After that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war and famine reigned, and the King already thought he must perish, for the scarcity was so great. Then the prince went to him and gave him the loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom, and then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the hosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace. The prince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers rode on. But after this they entered two more countries where war and famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his sword to the Kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after that they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea. During the passage, the two eldest conversed apart and said,“The youngest has found the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him the kingdom the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of all our fortune.”They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with each other to destroy him. They waited until they found him fast asleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, but into the cup they poured salt sea-water.

Now therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to the sick King in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured. But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he became still worse than before. And as he was lamenting over this, the two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having intended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true water of life, and handed it to him. He had scarcely tasted it, when he felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in the days of his youth. After that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said,“You certainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we the gain; you should have been sharper, and should have kept your eyes open. We took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea, and when a year is over, one of us will go and fetch the beautiful princess. But beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our father; indeed he does not trust you, and if you say a single word, you shall lose your life into the bargain, but if you keep silent, you shall have it as a gift.”

The old King was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had plotted against his life. So he summoned the court together and had sentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot. And once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no evil, the King's huntsman had to go with him, and when they were quite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said to him,“Dear huntsman, what ails you?”The huntsman said,“I cannot tell you, and yet I ought.”Then the prince said,“Say openly what it is, I will pardon you.”“Alas!”said the huntsman,“I am to shoot you dead, the King has ordered me to do it.”Then the prince was shocked, and said,“Dear huntsman, let me live; there, I give you my royal garments; give me your common ones in their stead.”The huntsman said,“I will willingly do that, indeed I should not have been able to shoot you.”Then they exchanged clothes, and the huntsman returned home; the prince, however, went further into the forest.

After a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the King for his youngest son, which were sent by the three Kings who had slain their enemies with the prince's sword, and maintained their people with his bread, and who wished to show their gratitude for it. The old King then thought,“Can my son have been innocent?”and said to his people,“Would that he were still alive, how it grieves me that I have suffered him to be killed!”“He still lives,”said the huntsman,“I could not find it in my heart to carry out your command,”and told the King how it had happened. Then a stone fell from the King's heart, and he had it proclaimed in every country that his son might return and be taken into favour again.

The princess, however, had a road made up to her palace which was quite bright and golden, and told her people that whosoever came riding straight along it to her, would be the right wooer and was to be admitted, and whoever rode by the side of it, was not the right one, and was not to be admitted. As the time was now close at hand, the eldest thought he would hasten to go to the King's daughter, and give himself out as her deliverer, and thus win her for his bride, and the kingdom to boot. Therefore he rode forth, and when he arrived in front of the palace, and saw the splendid golden road, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame if he were to ride over that, and turned aside, and rode on the right side of it. But when he came to the door, the servants told him that he was not the right man, and was to go away again. Soon after this the second prince set out, and when he came to the golden road, and his horse had put one foot on it, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame to tread a piece of it off, and he turned aside and rode on the left side of it, and when he reached the door, the attendants told him he was not the right one, and he was to go away again. When at last the year had entirely expired, the third son likewise wished to ride out of the forest to his beloved, and with her forget his sorrows. So he set out and thought of her so incessantly, and wished to be with her so much, that he never noticed the golden road at all. So his horse rode onwards up the middle of it, and when he came to the door, it was opened and the princess received him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and lord of the kingdom, and their wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing. When it was over she told him that his father invited him to come to him, and had forgiven him. So he rode thither, and told him everything; how his brothers had betrayed him, and how he had nevertheless kept silence. The old King wished to punish them, but they had put to sea, and never came back as long as they lived.





The Two Travellers


Hill and vale do not come together, but the children of men do, good and bad. In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels. The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment. He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he sang a little mocking song to him,





“Sew me the seam,

Draw me the thread,

Spread it over with pitch,

Knock the nail on the head.”





The shoemaker, however, could not endure a joke; he pulled a face as if he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize the tailor by the throat. But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said,“No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down.”The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began to clear away. He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said,“I spoke civilly to you; one speaks well after much drinking, but not after much thirst. Shall we travel together?”

“All right,”answered the tailor,“if only it suits you to go into a big town where there is no lack of work.”

“That is just where I want to go,”answered the shoemaker.“In a small nest there is nothing to earn, and in the country, people like to go barefoot.”They travelled therefore onwards together, and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow.

Both of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break. When they reached a town they went about and paid their respects to the tradesmen, and because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such pretty red cheeks, every one gave him work willingly, and when luck was good the master's daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch, as well. When he again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor had always the most in his bundle. The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face, and thought,“The greater the rascal the more the luck,”but the tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with his comrade. If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered good cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced, and it was lightly come, lightly go, with him.

When they had travelled for some time, they came to a great forest through which passed the road to the capital. Two foot-paths, however, led through it, one of which was a seven days' journey, and the other only two, but neither of the travellers knew which way was the short one. They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took counsel together how they should forecast, and for how many days they should provide themselves with bread. The shoemaker said,“One must look before one leaps, I will take with me bread for a week.”

“What!”said the tailor,“drag bread for seven days on one's back like a beast of burden, and not be able to look about. I shall trust in God, and not trouble myself about anything! The money I have in my pocket is as good in summer as in winter, but in hot weather bread gets dry, and mouldy into the bargain; even my coat does not go as far as it might. Besides, why should we not find the right way? Bread for two days, and that's enough.”Each, therefore, bought his own bread, and then they tried their luck in the forest.

It was as quiet there as in a church. No wind stirred, no brook murmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches no sunbeam forced its way. The shoemaker spoke never a word, the heavy bread weighed down his back until the perspiration streamed down his cross and gloomy face. The tailor, however, was quite merry, he jumped about, whistled on a leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself,“God in heaven must be pleased to see me so happy.”This lasted two days, but on the third the forest would not come to an end, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread, so after all his heart sank down a yard deeper. In the meantime he did not lose courage, but relied on God and on his luck. On the third day he lay down in the evening hungry under a tree, and rose again next morning hungry still; so also passed the fourth day, and when the shoemaker seated himself on a fallen tree and devoured his dinner, the tailor was only a looker-on. If he begged for a little piece of bread the other laughed mockingly, and said,“You have always been so merry, now you can try for once what it is to be sad: the birds which sing too early in the morning are struck by the hawk in the evening,”In short he was pitiless. But on the fifth morning the poor tailor could no longer stand up, and was hardly able to utter one word for weakness; his cheeks were white, and his eyes red. Then the shoemaker said to him,“I will give you a bit of bread to-day, but in return for it, I will put out your right eye.”The unhappy tailor who still wished to save his life, could not do it in any other way; he wept once more with both eyes, and then held them out, and the shoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye with a sharp knife. The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had formerly said to him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry.“Eat what one can, and suffer what one must.”When he had consumed his dearly-bought bread, he got on his legs again, forgot his misery and comforted himself with the thought that he could always see enough with one eye. But on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again, and gnawed him almost to the heart. In the evening he fell down by a tree, and on the seventh morning he could not raise himself up for faintness, and death was close at hand. Then said the shoemaker,“I will show mercy and give you bread once more, but you shall not have it for nothing, I shall put out your other eye for it.”And now the tailor felt how thoughtless his life had been, prayed to God for forgiveness, and said,“Do what you will, I will bear what I must, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on passively, and that an hour will come when the evil deed which you have done to me, and which I have not deserved of you, will be requited. When times were good with me, I shared what I had with you. My trade is of that kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other. If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no more I must go a-begging. At any rate do not leave me here alone when I am blind, or I shall die of hunger.”The shoemaker, however, who had driven God out of his heart, took the knife and put out his left eye. Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat, held out a stick to him, and drew him on behind him.

When the sun went down, they got out of the forest, and before them in the open country stood the gallows. Thither the shoemaker guided the blind tailor, and then left him alone and went his way. Weariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he slept the whole night. When day dawned he awoke, but knew not where he lay. Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, and a crow sat on the head of each of them. Then one of the men who had been hanged began to speak, and said,“Brother, are you awake?”

“Yes, I am awake,”answered the second.“Then I will tell you something,”said the first;“the dew which this night has fallen down over us from the gallows, gives every one who washes himself with it his eyes again. If blind people did but know this, how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be possible.”When the tailor heard that,he took his pocket-handkerchief, pressed it on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets of his eyes with it. Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had said, and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets. It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise behind the mountains; in the plain before him lay the great royal city with its magnificent gates and hundred towers, and the golden balls and crosses which were on the spires began to shine. He could distinguish every leaf on the trees, saw the birds which flew past, and the midges which danced in the air. He took a needle out of his pocket, and as he could thread it as well as ever he had done, his heart danced with delight. He threw himself on his knees, thanked God for the mercy he had shown him, and said his morning prayer. He did not forget also to pray for the poor sinners who were hanging there swinging against each other in the wind like the pendulums of clocks. Then he took his bundle on his back and soon forgot the pain of heart he had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling.

The first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at large. He caught it by the mane, and wanted to spring on it and ride into the town. The foal, however, begged to be set free.“I am still too young,”it said,“even a light tailor such as you are would break my back in two let me go till I have grown strong. A time may perhaps come when I may reward you for it.”

“Run off,”said the tailor,“I see you are still a giddy thing.”He gave it a touch with a switch over its back, whereupon it kicked up its hind legs for joy, leapt over hedges and ditches, and galloped away into the open country.

But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before.“The sun to be sure fills my eyes,”said he,“but the bread does not fill my mouth. The first thing that comes across me and is even half edible will have to suffer for it.”In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him.“Halt, halt!”cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg.“I don't know if you are good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great choice. I must cut your head off, and roast you.”

“Don't do that,”replied the stork;“I am a sacred bird which brings mankind great profit, and no one does me an injury. Leave me my life, and I may do you good in some other way.”“Well, be off, Cousin Longlegs,”said the tailor. The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away.

“What's to be the end of this?”said the tailor to himself at last,“my hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more empty. Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost.”At this moment he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him.“You come just at the right moment,”said he, and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck. On this an old duck which was hidden among the reeds, began to scream loudly, and swam to him with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare her dear children.“Can you not imagine,”said she,“how your mother would mourn if any one wanted to carry you off, and give you your finishing stroke?”

“Only be quiet,”said the good-tempered tailor,“you shall keep your children,”and put the prisoner back into the water.

When he turned round, he was standing in front of an old tree which was partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it.“There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed,”said the tailor,“the honey will refresh me.”But the Queen-bee came out, threatened him and said,“If you touch my people, and destroyest my nest, our stings shall pierce your skin like ten thousand red-hot needles. But if you will leave us in peace and go your way, we will do you a service for it another time.”

The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done.“Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner!”He dragged himself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town, and as it was just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn, and he was able to sit down at once to dinner. When he was satisfied he said,“Now I will get to work.”He went round the town, sought a master, and soon found a good situation. As, however, he had thoroughly learnt his trade, it was not long before he became famous, and every one wanted to have his new coat made by the little tailor, whose importance increased daily.“I can go no further in skill,”said he,“and yet things improve every day.”At last the King appointed him court-tailor.

But how things do happen in the world! On the very same day his former comrade the shoemaker also became court-shoemaker. When the latter caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he had once more two healthy eyes, his conscience troubled him.“Before he takes revenge on me,”thought he to himself,“I must dig a pit for him.”He, however, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself. In the evening when work was over and it had grown dusk, he stole to the King and said,“Lord King, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has boasted that he will get the gold crown back again which was lost in ancient times.”

“That would please me very much,”said the King, and he caused the tailor to be brought before him next morning, and ordered him to get the crown back again, or to leave the town for ever.“Oho!”thought the tailor,“a rogue gives more than he has got. If the surly King wants me to do what can be done by no one, I will not wait till morning, but will go out of the town at once, to-day.”He packed up his bundle, therefore, but when he was without the gate he could not help being sorry to give up his good fortune, and turn his back on the town in which all had gone so well with him. He came to the pond where he had made the acquaintance of the ducks; at that very moment the old one whose young ones he had spared, was sitting there by the shore, pluming herself with her beak. She knew him again instantly, and asked why he was hanging his head so?“You will not be surprised when you hear what has befallen me,”replied the tailor, and told her his fate.“If that be all,”said the duck,“we can help you. The crown fell into the water, and lies down below at the bottom; we will soon bring it up again for you. In the meantime just spread out your handkerchief on the bank.”She dived down with her twelve young ones, and in five minutes she was up again and sat with the crown resting on her wings, and the twelve young ones were swimming round about and had put their beaks under it, and were helping to carry it. They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief. No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was; when the sun shone on it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles. The tailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners, and carried it to the King, who was full of joy, and put a gold chain round the tailor's neck.

When the shoemaker saw that one stroke had failed, he contrived a second, and went to the King and said,“Lord King, the tailor has become insolent again; he boasts that he will copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, loose or fast, inside and out.”The King sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertained to it, movable or immovable, within and without, and if he did not succeed in doing this, or if so much as one nail on the wall were wanting, he should be imprisoned for his whole life under ground. The tailor thought,“It gets worse and worse! No one can endure that?”and threw his bundle on his back, and went forth. When he came to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head. The bees came flying out, and the Queen-bee asked him if he had a stiff neck, since he held his head so awry?“Alas, no,”answered the tailor,“something quite different weighs me down,”and he told her what the King had demanded of him. The bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves, and the Queen-bee said,“Just go home again, but come back to-morrow at this time, and bring a large sheet with you, and then all will be well.”So he turned back again, but the bees flew to the royal palace and straight into it through the open windows, crept round about into every corner, and inspected everything most carefully. Then they hurried back and modelled the palace in wax with such rapidity that any one looking on would have thought it was growing before his eyes. By the evening all was ready, and when the tailor came next morning, the whole of the splendid building was there, and not one nail in the wall or tile of the roof was wanting, and it was delicate withal, and white as snow, and smelt sweet as honey. The tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to the King, who could not admire it enough, placed it in his largest hall, and in return for it presented the tailor with a large stone house.

The shoemaker, however, did not give up, but went for the third time to the King and said,“Lord King, it has come to the tailor's ears that no water will spring up in the court-yard of the castle, and he has boasted that it shall rise up in the midst of the court-yard to a man's height and be clear as crystal.”Then the King ordered the tailor to be brought before him and said,“If a stream of water does not rise in my court-yard by to-morrow as you have promised, the executioner shall in that very place make you shorter by the head.”The poor tailor did not take long to think about it, but hurried out to the gate, and because this time it was a matter of life and death to him, tears rolled down his face. Whilst he was thus going forth full of sorrow, the foal to which he had formerly given its liberty, and which had now become a beautiful chestnut horse, came leaping towards him.“The time has come,”it said to the tailor,“when I can repay you for your good deed. I know already what is needful to you, but you shall soon have help; get on me, my back can carry two such as you.”The tailor's courage came back to him; he jumped up in one bound, and the horse went full speed into the town, and right up to the court-yard of the castle. It galloped as quick as lightning thrice round it, and at the third time it fell violently down. At the same instant, however, there was a terrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the court-yard sprang like a cannon-ball into the air, and over the castle, and directly after it a jet of water rose as high as a man on horseback, and the water was as pure as crystal, and the sunbeams began to dance on it. When the King saw that he arose in amazement, and went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men.

But good fortune did not last long. The King had daughters in plenty, one still prettier than the other, but he had no son. So the malicious shoemaker betook himself for the fourth time to the King, and said,“Lord King, the tailor has not given up his arrogance. He has now boasted that if he liked, he could cause a son to be brought to the Lord king through the air.”The King commanded the tailor to be summoned, and said,“If you cause a son to be brought to me within nine days, you shall have my eldest daughter to wife.”“The reward is indeed great,”thought the little tailor;“one would willingly do something for it, but the cherries grow too high for me, if I climb for them, the bough will break beneath me, and I shall fall.”

He went home, seated himself cross-legged on his work-table, and thought over what was to be done.“It can't be managed,”cried he at last,“I will go away; after all I can't live in peace here.”He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate. When he got to the meadow, he perceived his old friend the stork, who was walking backwards and forwards like a philosopher. Sometimes he stood still, took a frog into close consideration, and at length swallowed it down. The stork came to him and greeted him.“I see,”he began,“that you have your pack on your back. Why are you leaving the town?”The tailor told him what the King had required of him, and how he could not perform it, and lamented his misfortune.“Don't let your hair grow grey about that,”said the stork,“I will help you out of your difficulty. For a long time now, I have carried the children in swaddling-clothes into the town, so for once in a way I can fetch a little prince out of the well. Go home and be easy. In nine days from this time repair to the royal palace, and there will I come.”The little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the castle. It was not long before the stork came flying thither and tapped at the window. The tailor opened it, and cousin Longlegs came carefully in, and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement. He had, moreover, a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel, and stretched out its little hands to the Queen. The stork laid it in her lap, and she caressed it and kissed it, and was beside herself with delight. Before the stork flew away, he took his travelling bag off his back and handed it over to the Queen. In it there were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats, and they were divided amongst the little princesses. The eldest, however, had none of them, but got the merry tailor for a husband.“It seems to me,”said he,“just as if I had won the highest prize. My mother was if right after all, she always said that whoever trusts in God and only has good luck, can never fail.”

The shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced at the wedding festival, after which he was commanded to quit the town for ever. The road to the forest led him to the gallows. Worn out with anger, rage, and the heat of the day, he threw himself down. When he had closed his eyes and was about to sleep, the two crows flew down from the heads of the men who were hanging there, and pecked his eyes out. In his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of hunger, for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him.





The Bright Sun Brings It to Light


A tailor's apprentice was travelling about the world in search of work, and at one time he could find none, and his poverty was so great that he had not a farthing to live on. Presently he met a Jew on the road, and as he thought he would have a great deal of money about him, the tailor thrust God out of his heart, fell on the Jew, and said,“Give me your money, or I will strike you dead.”Then said the Jew,“Grant me my life, I have no money but eight farthings.”But the tailor said,“Money you have; and it shall be produced,”and used violence and beat him until he was near death. And when the Jew was dying, the last words he said were,“The bright sun will bring it to light,”and thereupon he died. The tailor's apprentice felt in his pockets and sought for money, but he found nothing but eight farthings, as the Jew had said. Then he took him up and carried him behind a clump of trees, and went onwards to seek work. After he had traveled about a long while, he got work in a town with a master who had a pretty daughter, with whom he fell in love, and he married her, and lived in good and happy wedlock.

After a long time when he and his wife had two children, the wife's father and mother died, and the young people kept house alone. One morning, when the husband was sitting on the table before the window, his wife brought him his coffee, and when he had poured it out into the saucer, and was just going to drink, the sun shone on it and the reflection gleamed hither and thither on the wall above, and made circles on it.Then the tailor looked up and said,“Yes, it would like very much to bring it to light, and cannot!”The woman said,“Oh, dear husband, and what is that, then?”“What do you mean by that?”He answered,“I must not tell you.”But she said,“If you love me, you must tell me,”and used her most affectionate words, and said that no one should ever know it, and left him no rest. Then he told her how years ago, when he was travelling about seeking work and quite worn out and penniless, he had killed a Jew, and that in the last agonies of death, the Jew had spoken the words,“The bright sun will bring it to light.”And now, the sun had just wanted to bring it to light, and had gleamed and made circles on the wall, but had not been able to do it. After this, he again charged her particularly never to tell this, or he would lose his life, and she did promise. When however, he had sat down to work again, she went to her great friend and confided the story to her, but she was never to repeat it to any human being, but before three days were over, the whole town knew it, and the tailor was brought to trial, and condemned. And thus, after all, the bright sun did bring it to light.





The Blue Light


There was once on a time a soldier who for many years had served the King faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The King said to him,“You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.”Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch.“Do give me one night's lodging, and a little to eat and drink,”said he to her,“or I shall starve.”

“Oho!”she answered,“who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.”

“What do you wish?”said the soldier.“That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.”The soldier consented, and next day labored with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening.“I see well enough,”said the witch,“that you can do no more to-day, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must to-morrow chop me a load of wood, and make it small.”The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more.“To-morrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again for me.”Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him.“No,”said he, perceiving her evil intention,“I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.”The witch fell into a passion, let him down again into the well, and went away.

The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full.“This shall be my last pleasure,”thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said,“Lord, what are your commands?”

“What commands have I to give you?”replied the soldier, quite astonished.

“I must do everything you bid me,”said the little man.

“Good,”said the soldier;“then in the first place help me out of this well.”The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said to the little man,“Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.”In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift as the wind on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the little man re-appeared.“It is all done,”said he,“and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?”inquired the dwarf.

“At this moment, none,”answered the soldier;“You can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.”

“Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once.”Thereupon he vanished from his sight.

The soldier returned to the town from which he had come. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black mannikin and said,“I have served the King faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.”

“What am I to do?”asked the little man.

“Late at night, when the King's daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant's work for me.”

The mannikin said,“That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.”

When twelve o'clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the princess.“Aha! are you there?”cried the soldier,“get to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.”When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said,“Pull off my boots for me,”and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed.

Next morning when the princess arose, she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream.“I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,”said she,“and taken into a soldier's room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.”

“The dream may have been true,”said the King,“I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.”But unseen by the King, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant's work until cock-crow.

Next morning the King sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying,“It must have rained peas, last night.”“We must think of something else,”said the King;“keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.”The black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier's house it would go badly with him.“Do what I bid you,”replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.

Next morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter's shoe. It was found at the soldier's, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him,“Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.”His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin.“Have no fear,”said the latter to his master.“Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.”Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the King.“What is it?”asked the King.

“That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.”

“You may smoke three,”answered the King,“but do not imagine that I will spare your life.”Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said,“What does my lord command?”

“Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the King who has treated me so ill.”Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The King was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier's mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.





Donkey Cabbages


There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait. He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither, whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him and said,“Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an alms.”The huntsman had compassion on the poor old creature, felt in his pocket, and gave her what he could afford. He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and said,“Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you; I will make you a present in return for your kindness. Go on your way now, but in a little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting which have a cloak in their claws, and are plucking at it; take your gun and shoot into the midst of them, they will let the cloak fall down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down dead. Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak; when you throw it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye. Take out the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your pillow.”

The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself,“Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true.”And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he looked up and saw there a crowd of birds who were tearing a piece of cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to himself.“Well,”said the huntsman,“this is wonderful, it has really come to pass just as the old wife foretold!”and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about. The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time. Then the huntsman did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.

Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled. When he lifted up the pillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found another, and so it went on, every time he got up. He gathered together a heap of gold, but at last he thought,“Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will go forth and see the world.”

He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman's pouch and gun, and went out into the world. It came to pass, that one day he travelled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle. An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of the windows. The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the maiden,“There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his body, we must filch it from him, my dear daughter, it is more suitable for us than for him. He has a bird's heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow.”She told her what she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with angry eyes,“And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the worse for you.”Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to himself,“I have travelled about for such a long time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle. I have certainly money enough.”Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl.

He entered the house, and was well received and courteously entertained. Before long he was so much in love with the young witch that he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as she saw them, and did what she desired. The old woman then said,“Now we must have the bird's heart, he will never miss it.”She prepared a drink, and when it was ready, poured it into a cup and gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman. She did so, saying,“Now, my dearest, drink to me.”So he took the cup, and when he had swallowed the draught, he brought up the heart of the bird. The girl had to take it away secretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so. Thenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay instead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched it away every morning; but he was so much in love and so befooled, that he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the girl.

Then the old witch said,“We have the bird's heart, but we must also take the wishing-cloak away from him.”The girl answered,“We will leave him that, he has lost his wealth.”The old woman was angry and said,“Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found in this world. I must and will have it!”She gave the girl several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with her. So she did the old woman's bidding, placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful. The huntsman asked,“Why do you stand there so sorrowfully?”

“Ah, my beloved,”was her answer,“over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain, where the precious stones grow. I long for them so much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them? Only the birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.”

“Have you nothing else to complain of?”said the huntsman.“I will soon remove that burden from your heart.”With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet Mountain, and in the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together. Precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see them, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them. Now, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes of the huntsman should become heavy. He said to the maiden,“We will sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer stand on my feet.”Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished herself back at home with them.

But when the huntsman had had his sleep out and awoke, and perceived that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild mountain, he said,“Oh, what treachery there is in the world!”and sat down there in care and sorrow, not knowing what to do. But the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before he saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were sunk in a deep sleep. Then the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and said,“What sort of an earth-worm is lying curled up here?”The second said,“Step upon him and kill him.”But the third said,“That would indeed be worth your while; just let him live, he cannot remain here; and when he climbs higher, toward the summit of of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him and bear him away.”So saying they passed by. But the huntsman had paid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a while, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away, and travelled about for a long time in the heavens. Then it sank lower, and let itself down on a great cabbage-garden, girt round by walls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and vegetables.

Then the huntsman looked about him and said,“If I had but something to eat! I am so hungry, and my hunger will increase in course of time; but I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort of fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages,”but at length he thought,“At a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste particularly good, but they will refresh me.”With that he picked himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite different. Four legs grew on him, a large head and two thick ears, and he saw with horror that he was changed into an ass. Still as his hunger increased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his present nature, he went on eating with great zest. At last he arrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had swallowed it, he again felt a change, and reassumed his former human shape.

Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue. When he awoke next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of the good ones, and thought to himself,“This shall help me to get my own again and punish treachery.”Then he took the cabbages with him, climbed over the wall, and went forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart. After wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again. He dyed his face brown, so that his own mother would not have known him; and begged for shelter:“I am so tired,”said he,“that I can go no further.”The witch asked,“Who are you, countryman, and what is your business?”“I am a King's messenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which grows beneath the sun. I have even been so fortunate as to find it, and am carrying it about with me; but the heat of the sun is so intense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not know if I can carry it any further.”

When the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and said,“Dear countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.”

“Why not?”answered he,“I have brought two heads with me, and will give you one of them,”and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage. The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it. When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an ass. Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up; but on the way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate a couple of leaves. Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman, and the dish of salad fell to the ground. Meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said,“I don't know what has become of the salad.”The huntsman thought,“The salad must have already taken effect,”and said,“I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.”As he went down he saw the two asses running about in the courtyard; the salad, however, was lying on the ground.“All right,”said he,“the two have taken their portion,”and he picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden.“I bring you the delicate food myself,”said he,“in order that you may not have to wait longer.”Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.

After the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said,“Now you shall receive the wages of your treachery,”and bound them together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came to a mill. He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head, and asked what he wanted.“I have three unmanageable beasts,”answered he,“which I don't want to keep any longer. Will you take them in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I tell you, and then I will pay you what you ask.”The miller said,“Why not? But how am I to manage them?”The huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey, and that was the witch; one beating and three meals to the younger one, which was the servant-girl; and to the youngest, which was the maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten. After that he went back into the castle, and found therein everything he needed.

After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him that the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal daily was dead;“the two others,”he continued,“are certainly not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they cannot last much longer.”The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him. And when they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they became human again. The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him, and said,“Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you; my mother drove me to it; it was done against my will, for I love you dearly. Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the bird's-heart I will take a vomiting potion.”But he thought otherwise, and said,“Keep it; it is all the same, for I will take you for my true wife.”So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily together until their death.





The Three Brothers


There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived. Now each of the sons wished to have the house after his father's death; but the father loved them all alike, and did not know what to do; he did not wish to sell the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided the money amongst them. At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons,“Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a trade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house.”The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. They fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each went his way. It chanced that they all found skillful masters, who taught them their trades well. The blacksmith had to shoe the King's horses, and he thought to himself,“The house is mine, without doubt.”The barber only shaved great people, and he too already looked upon the house as his own. The fencing-master got many a blow, but he only bit his lip, and let nothing vex him;“for,”said he to himself,“If you are afraid of a blow, you'll never win the house.”When the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back home to their father; but they did not know how to find the best opportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together. As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the field.“Ah, ha, just in time!”said the barber. So he took his basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare came up; then he soaped and shaved off the hare's whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body.“Well done!”said the old man.“Your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully, or the house will be yours.”Soon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full speed.“Now you shall see what I can do, father,”said the blacksmith; so away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put him on four new shoes without stopping him.“You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother,”said his father;“I do not know to which I ought to give the house.”Then the third son said,“Father, let me have my turn, if you please;”and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not a drop fell upon him. It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down in torrents; but he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house. When his father saw this he was amazed, and said,“This is the master-piece, the house is yours!”

His brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand; and, as they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together in the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so well and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money. Thus they lived together happily until they grew old; and at last, when one of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely about it that they also fell ill, and soon after died. And because they had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were all laid in the same grave.





The Shoes That Were Danced to Pieces


There was once upon a time a King who had twelve daughters, each one more beautiful than the other. They all slept together in one chamber, in which their beds stood side by side, and every night when they were in them the King locked the door, and bolted it. But in the morning when he unlocked the door, he saw that their shoes were worn out with dancing, and no one could find out how that had come to pass. Then the King caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where they danced at night, should choose one of them for his wife and be King after his death, but that whosoever came forward and had not discovered it within three days and nights, should have forfeited his life. It was not long before a King's son presented himself, and offered to undertake the enterprise. He was well received, and in the evening was led into a room adjoining the princesses' sleeping-chamber. His bed was placed there, and he was to observe where they went and danced, and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to some other place, the door of their room was left open.

But the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead, and he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, all twelve had been to the dance, for their shoes were standing there with holes in the soles. On the second and third nights it fell out just the same, and then his head was struck off without mercy. Many others came after this and undertook the enterprise, but all forfeited their lives. Now it came to pass that a poor soldier, who had a wound, and could serve no longer, found himself on the road to the town where the King lived. There he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going.“I hardly know myself,”answered he, and added in jest,“I had half a mind to discover where the princesses danced their shoes into holes, and thus become King.”

“That is not so difficult,”said the old woman,“you must not drink the wine which will be brought to you at night, and must pretend to be sound asleep.”With that she gave him a little cloak, and said,“If you put on that, you will be invisible, and then you can steal after the twelve.”When the soldier had received this good advice, he went into the thing in earnest, took heart, went to the King, and announced himself as a suitor. He was as well received as the others, and royal garments were put upon him. He was conducted that evening at bed-time into the ante-chamber, and as he was about to go to bed, the eldest came and brought him a cup of wine, but he had tied a sponge under his chin, and let the wine run down into it, without drinking a drop. Then he lay down and when he had lain a while, he began to snore, as if in the deepest sleep. The twelve princesses heard that, and laughed, and the eldest said,“He, too, might as well have saved his life.”With that they got up, opened wardrobes, presses, cupboards, and brought out pretty dresses; dressed themselves before the mirrors, sprang about, and rejoiced at the prospect of the dance. Only the youngest said,“I know not how it is; you are very happy, but I feel very strange; some misfortune is certainly about to befall us.”

“You are a goose, who art always frightened,”said the eldest.“Have you forgotten how many Kings' sons have already come here in vain? I had hardly any need to give the soldier a sleeping-draught, in any case the clown would not have awakened.”When they were all ready they looked carefully at the soldier, but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir, so they felt themselves quite secure. The eldest then went to her bed and tapped it; it immediately sank into the earth, and one after the other they descended through the opening, the eldest going first. The soldier, who had watched everything, tarried no longer, put on his little cloak, and went down last with the youngest. Half-way down the steps, he just trod a little on her dress; she was terrified at that, and cried out,“What is that? who is pulling at my dress?”

“Don't be so silly!”said the eldest,“you have caught it on a nail.”Then they went all the way down, and when they were at the bottom, they were standing in a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees, all the leaves of which were of silver, and shone and glistened. The soldier thought,“I must carry a token away with me,”and broke off a twig from one of them, on which the tree cracked with a loud report. The youngest cried out again.“Something is wrong, did you hear the crack?”But the eldest said,“It is a gun fired for joy, because we have got rid of our prince so quickly.”After that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were of gold, and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds; he broke off a twig from each, which made such a crack each time that the youngest started back in terror, but the eldest still maintained that they were salutes. They went on and came to a great lake whereon stood twelve little boats, and in every boat sat a handsome prince, all of whom were waiting for the twelve, and each took one of them with him, but the soldier seated himself by the youngest. Then her prince said,“I can't tell why the boat is so much heavier to-day; I shall have to row with all my strength, if I am to get it across.”

“What should cause that,”said the youngest,“but the warm weather? I feel very warm too.”On the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid, brightly-lit castle, from whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettle-drums. They rowed over there, entered, and each prince danced with the girl he loved, but the soldier danced with them unseen, and when one of them had a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up, so that the cup was empty when she carried it to her mouth; the youngest was alarmed at this, but the eldest always made her be silent. They danced there till three o'clock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes, and they were forced to leave off; the princes rowed them back again over the lake, and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest. On the shore they took leave of their princes, and promised to return the following night. When they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in front and lay down in his bed, and when the twelve had come up slowly and wearily, he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear him, and they said,“So far as he is concerned, we are safe.”They took off their beautiful dresses, laid them away, put the worn-out shoes under the bed, and lay down. Next morning the soldier was resolved not to speak, but to watch the wonderful goings on, and again went with them a second and a third night. Then everything was done just as it had been done the first time, and each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces. But the third time he took a cup away with him as a token. When the hour had arrived for him to give his answer, he took the three twigs and the cup, and went to the King, but the twelve stood behind the door, and listened for what he was going to say. When the King put the question,“Where have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the night?”he answered,“In an underground castle with twelve princes,”and related how it had come to pass, and brought out the tokens. The King then summoned his daughters, and asked them if the soldier had told the truth, and when they saw that they were betrayed, and that falsehood would be of no avail, they were obliged to confess all. Thereupon the King asked which of them he would have to wife? He answered,“I am no longer young, so give me the eldest.”Then the wedding was celebrated on the self-same day, and the kingdom was promised him after the King's death. But the princes were bewitched for as many days as they had danced nights with the twelve.





The White Bride and the Black Bride


A woman was going about the unenclosed land with her daughter and her step-daughter cutting fodder, when the Lord came walking towards them in the form of a poor man, and asked,“Which is the way into the village?”

“If you want to know,”said the mother,“seek it for yourself,”and the daughter added,“If you are afraid you will not find it, take a guide with you.”But the step-daughter said,“Poor man, I will take you there, come with me.”Then God was angry with the mother and daughter, and turned his back on them, and wished that they should become as black as night and as ugly as sin. To the poor step-daughter, however, God was gracious, and went with her, and when they were near the village, he said a blessing over her, and spake,“Choose three things for yourself, and I will grant them to you.”Then said the maiden,“I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun,”and instantly she was white and fair as day.“Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty.”That the Lord gave her also, but he said,“Do not forget what is best of all.”Said she,“For my third wish, I desire, after my death, to inhabit the eternal kingdom of Heaven.”That also was granted unto her, and then the Lord left her.

When the step-mother came home with her daughter, and they saw that they were both as black as coal and ugly, but that the step-daughter was white and beautiful, wickedness increased still more in their hearts,and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an injury. The step-daughter, however, had a brother called Reginer, whom she loved much, and she told him all that had happened. Once on a time Reginer said to her,“Dear sister, I will take your likeness, that I may continually see you before mine eyes, for my love for you is so great that I should like always to look at you.”Then she answered,“But, I pray you, let no one see the picture.”So he painted his sister and hung up the picture in his room; he, however, dwelt in the King's palace, for he was his coachman. Every day he went and stood before the picture, and thanked God for the happiness of having such a dear sister. Now it happened that the King whom he served, had just lost his wife, who had been so beautiful that no one could be found to compare with her, and on this account the King was in deep grief. The attendants about the court, however, remarked that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful picture, and they were jealous of him, so they informed the King. Then the latter ordered the picture to be brought to him, and when he saw that it was like his lost wife in every respect, except that it was still more beautiful, he fell mortally in love with it. He caused the coachman to be brought before him, and asked whom the portrait represented? The coachman said it was his sister, so the King resolved to take no one but her as his wife, and gave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold, and sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride. When Reginer came on this errand, his sister was glad, but the black maiden was jealous of her good fortune, and grew angry above all measure, and said to her mother,“Of what use are all your arts to us now when you cannot procure such a piece of luck for me?”

“Be quiet,”said the old woman,“I will soon divert it to you,”and by her arts of witchcraft, she so troubled the eyes of the coachman that he was half-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white maiden so that she was half-deaf. Then they got into the carriage, first the bride in her noble royal apparel, then the step-mother with her daughter, and Reginer sat on the box to drive. When they had been on the way for some time the coachman cried,

“Cover you well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet you, That the wind may not load you with dust, That you may'st be fair and beautiful When you appearest before the King.”

The bride asked,“What is my dear brother saying?”

“Ah,”said the old woman,“he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give it to your sister.”Then she took it off, and put it on the black maiden, who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown. They drove onwards, and a short time afterwards, the brother again cried,

“Cover you well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet you, That the wind may not load you with dust, That you may'st be fair and beautiful When you appearest before the King.”

The bride asked,“What is my dear brother saying?”

“Ah,”said the old woman,“he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister.”So she took off the hood and put it on her sister, and sat with her own head uncovered. And they drove on farther. After a while, the brother once more cried,

“Cover you well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet you, That the wind may not load you with dust, That you may'st be fair and beautiful When you appearest before the King.”

The bride asked,“What is my dear brother saying?”

“Ah,”said the old woman,“he says you must look out of the carriage.”They were, however, just on a bridge, which crossed deep water. When the bride stood up and leant forward out of the carriage, they both pushed her out, and she fell into the middle of the water. At the same moment that she sank, a snow-white duck arose out of the mirror-smooth water, and swam down the river. The brother had observed nothing of it, and drove the carriage on until they reached the court. Then he took the black maiden to the King as his sister, and thought she really was so,because his eyes were dim, and he saw the golden garments glittering. When the King saw the boundless ugliness of his intended bride, he was very angry, and ordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit which was full of adders and nests of snakes. The old witch, however, knew so well how to flatter the King and deceive his eyes by her arts, that he kept her and her daughter until she appeared quite endurable to him, and he really married her.

One evening when the black bride was sitting on the King's knee, a white duck came swimming up the gutter to the kitchen, and said to the kitchen-boy,“Boy, light a fire, that I may warm my feathers.”

The kitchen-boy did it, and lighted a fire on the hearth. Then came the duck and sat down by it, and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to rights with her bill. While she was thus sitting and enjoying herself, she asked,“What is my brother Reginer doing?”

The scullery-boy replied,“He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes.”

Then she asked,“What is the black witch doing in the house?”

The boy answered,“She is loved by the King and happy.”

“May God have mercy on him,”said the duck, and swam forth by the sink.

The next night she came again and put the same questions, and the third night also. Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer, and went to the King and discovered all to him. The King, however, wanted to see it for himself, and next evening went thither, and when the duck thrust her head in through the sink, he took his sword and cut through her neck, and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden, exactly like the picture, which her brother had made of her. The King was full of joy, and as she stood there quite wet, he caused splendid apparel to be brought and had her clothed in it. Then she told how she had been betrayed by cunning and falsehood, and at last thrown down into the water, and her first request was that her brother should be brought forth from the pit of snakes, and when the King had fulfilled this request, he went into the chamber where the old witch was, and asked, What does she deserve who does this and that? and related what had happened. Then was she so blinded that she was aware of nothing and said,“She deserves to be stripped naked, and put into a barrel with nails, and that a horse should be harnessed to the barrel, and the horse sent all over the world.”All of which was done to her, and to her black daughter. But the King married the white and beautiful bride, and rewarded her faithful brother, and made him a rich and distinguished man.





Simeli Mountain


There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children. Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement. While he was thus standing he saw a twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen. The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried,“Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,”and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut. After a short time, however, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said,“Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut yourself;”then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away. When they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. So he went up to it and said,“Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,”and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said,“Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut yourself;”and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow. And now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain. He lived joyously and uprightly, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one. When, however, the money came to an end he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things. When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother. The rich man had, however, long been envious of his brother's possessions, and of the handsome way of living which he had set on foot, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure. Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. He at once went to his brother and asked him,“What have you been measuring in the bushel measure?”

“Corn and barley,”said the other. Then he showed him the piece of money, and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice. The poor man then told him everything, just as it happened. The rich man, however, ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures. When he came to the mountain he cried,“Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open.”The mountain opened, and he went inside it. There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first. At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. He wished to carry his burden outside, but, as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried,“Simeli mountain, Simeli mountain, open.”That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut. Then he was alarmed, but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and his treasures were no more of any use to him. In the evening the mountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him they laughed, and cried out,“Bird, have we caught you at last! Did you think we had never noticed that you had been in here twice? We could not catch you then; this third time you shall not get out again!”Then he cried,“It was not I, it was my brother,”but let him beg for his life and say what he would, they cut his head off.





The Donkey


Once on a time there lived a King and a Queen, who were rich, and had everything they wanted, but no children. The Queen lamented over this day and night, and said,“I am like a field on which nothing grows.”At last God gave her her wish, but when the child came into the world, it did not look like a human child, but was a little donkey. When the mother saw that, her lamentations and outcries began in real earnest; she said she would far rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that they were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour it. But the King said,“No, since God has sent him he shall be my son and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and wear the kingly crown.”The donkey, therefore, was brought up and grew bigger, and his ears grew up beautifully high and straight. He was, however, of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and had especial pleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and said,“Teach me your art, that I may play the lute as well as you do.”

“Ah, dear little master,”answered the musician,“that would come very hard to you, your fingers are certainly not suited to it, and are far too big. I am afraid the strings would not last.”No excuses were of any use. The donkey was determined to play the lute; he was persevering and industrious, and at last learnt to do it as well as the master himself. The young lordling once went out walking full of thought and came to a well, he looked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey's form. He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion. They travelled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where an old King reigned who had an only but wonderfully beautiful daughter. The donkey said,“Here we will stay,”knocked at the gate, and cried,“A guest is without open, that he may enter.”As, however, the gate was not opened, he sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful manner with his two fore-feet. Then the door-keeper opened his eyes most wonderfully wide, and ran to the King and said,“Outside by the gate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an experienced master!”

“Then let the musician come to me,”said the King. When, however, a donkey came in, every one began to laugh at the lute-player. And now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants. He, however, was unwilling, and said,“I am no common stable-ass, I am a noble one.”Then they said,“If that is what you are, seat yourself with the men of war.”

“No,”said he,“I will sit by the King.”The King smiled, and said good-humouredly,“Yes, it shall be as you will, little ass, come here to me.”Then he asked,“Little ass, how does my daughter please you?”The donkey turned his head towards her, looked at her, nodded and said,“I like her above measure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is.”

“Well, then, you shall sit next her too,”said the King.“That is exactly what I wish,”said the donkey, and he placed himself by her side, ate and drank, and knew how to behave himself daintily and cleanly. When the noble beast had stayed a long time at the King's court, he thought,“What good does all this do me, I shall still have to go home again?”let his head hang sadly, and went to the King and asked for his dismissal. But the King had grown fond of him, and said,“Little ass, what ails you? You look as sour as a jug of vinegar, I will give you what you want. Do you want gold?”

“No,”said the donkey, and shook his head.“Do you want jewels and rich dress?”

“No.”

“Do you wish for half my kingdom?”

“Indeed, no.”Then said the King,“if I did but know what would make you content. Will you have my pretty daughter to wife?”

“Ah, yes,”said the ass,“I should indeed like her,”and all at once he became quite merry and full of happiness, for that was exactly what he was wishing for. So a great and splendid wedding was held. In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom were led into their bed-room, the King wanted to know if the ass would behave well, and ordered a servant to hide himself there. When they were both within, the bridegroom bolted the door, looked around, and as he believed that they were quite alone, he suddenly threw off his ass's skin, and stood there in the form of a handsome royal youth.“Now,”said he,“you see who I am, and see also that I am not unworthy of you.”Then the bride was glad, and kissed him, and loved him dearly. When morning came, he jumped up, put his animal's skin on again, and no one could have guessed what kind of a form was hidden beneath it. Soon came the old King,“Ah,”cried he,“is the little ass merry? But surely you are sad?”said he to his daughter,“that you have not got a proper man for your husband?”

“Oh, no, dear father, I love him as well as if he were the handsomest in the world, and I will keep him as long as I live.”The King was surprised, but the servant who had concealed himself came and revealed everything to him. The King said,“That cannot be true.”

“Then watch yourself the next night, and you will see it with your own eyes; and hark you, lord King, if you were to take his skin away and throw it in the fire, he would be forced to show himself in his true shape.”

“Your advice is good,”said the King, and at night when they were asleep, he stole in, and when he got to the bed he saw by the light of the moon a noble-looking youth lying there, and the skin lay stretched on the ground. So he took it away, and had a great fire lighted outside, and threw the skin into it, and remained by it himself until it was all burnt to ashes. As, however, he was anxious to know how the robbed man would behave himself, he stayed awake the whole night and watched. When the youth had slept his sleep out, he got up by the first light of morning, and wanted to put on the ass's skin, but it was not to be found. On this he was alarmed, and, full of grief and anxiety, said,“Now I shall have to contrive to escape.”But when he went out, there stood the King, who said,“My son, whither away in such haste? what have you in mind? Stay here, you are such a handsome man, you shall not go away from me. I will now give you half my kingdom, and after my death you shall have the whole of it.”

“Then I hope that what begins so well may end well, and I will stay with you,”said the youth. And the old man gave him half the kingdom, and in a year's time, when he died, the youth had the whole, and after the death of his father he had another kingdom as well, and lived in all magnificence.





The Shepherd Boy


There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question. The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy. Then he said to him,“If you can give me an answer to three questions which I will ask you, I will look on you as my own child, and you shall dwell with me in my royal palace.”The boy said,“What are the three questions?”The King said,“The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?”The shepherd boy answered,“Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.”The King said,“The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?”The shepherd boy said,“Give me a great sheet of white paper,”and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight. Then he said,“There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.”But no one was able to do it. The King said,“The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.”Then said the shepherd boy,“In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles high, two miles wide, and two miles deep; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.”

The King said,“You have answered the three questions like a wise man, and shall henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard you as my own child.”





The Star-Money


There was once on a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her. She was, however, good and pious. And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God. Then a poor man met her, who said,“Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!”She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said,“May God bless it to your use,”and went onwards. Then came a child who moaned and said,“My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.”So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also. At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself,“It is a dark night and no one sees you, you can very well give your little shirt away,”and took it off, and gave away that also. And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her little shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen. Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the days of her life.





Snow-White and Rose-Red


There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do. The two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said,“We will not leave each other,”Rose-red answered,“Never so long as we live,”and their mother would add,“What one has she must share with the other.”They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew. No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account. Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.

Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother's little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother's bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin. The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said,“Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,”and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings.

One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said,“Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.”Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door. Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother's bed. But the bear began to speak and said,“Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.”

“Poor bear,”said the mother,“lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.”Then she cried,“Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.”So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said,“Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;”so they brought the broom and swept the bear's hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out,“Leave me alive, children,“Snowy-white, Rosy-red, Will you beat your lover dead?”

When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear,“You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.”As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest. Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived.

When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white,“Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.”

“Where are you going, then, dear bear?”asked Snow-white.

“I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.”Snow-white was quite sorry for his going away, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out,he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.

A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backwards and forwards like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do. He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried,“Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?”

“What are you about there, little man?”asked Rose-red.

“You stupid, prying goose!”answered the dwarf;“I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight in and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!”

The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast.“I will run and fetch some one,”said Rose-red.

“You senseless goose!”snarled the dwarf;“why should you fetch some one? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?”

“Don't be impatient,”said Snow-white,“I will help you,”and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself,“Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!”and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children.

Some time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf.“Where are you going?”said Rose-red;“you surely don't want to go into the water?”

“I am not such a fool!”cried the dwarf;“don't you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?”The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the fishing-line; just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water. The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out,“Is that civil, you toad-stool, to disfigure one's face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!”Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without saying a word more he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.

It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn here and there. Now they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far off. Directly afterwards they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off. The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice,“Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you helpless clumsy creatures!”Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on their way and did their business in the town. As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones;they glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that the children stood still and looked at them.“Why do you stand gaping there?”cried the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage. He was going on with his bad words when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not get to his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried,“Dear Mr. Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy's sake eat them!”The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.

The girls had run away, but the bear called to them,“Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.”Then they knew his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there, a handsome man, clothed all in gold.“I am a King's son,”he said,“and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.”

Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red.





The Glass Coffin


Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors; all that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck. A civil, adroit tailor's apprentice once went out travelling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself. Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude. He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree. He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it, and thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away.

After he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light. It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes. He knocked boldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together.“Who are you, and what do you want?”asked the man in a grumbling voice.“I am a poor tailor,”he answered,“whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning.”

“Go your way,”replied the old man in a surly voice,“I will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.”After these words he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner.

The weary tailor needed no rocking; but slept sweetly till morning, but even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had not been aroused by a great noise. A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut. The tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out. Then close by the hut, he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just preparing for a violent struggle. They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries. For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory; at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary's body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was thoroughly despatched by a few strokes from the stag.

The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns. He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow. He held with both hands to the tops of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate. It seemed, however, to him just as if he were flying away. At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down. The tailor, more dead than alive, required a longer time than that to come to himself. When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock, that it sprang open. Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight. The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again. Whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him,“Enter without fear, no evil shall befall you you.”He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him. He looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him,“Step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits you.”

His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order. The stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths. When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former. Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire. Hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour. On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity. When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things. Everything was small, but exceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be cut out by a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude.

He might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this rarity for some time, if the voice had not once more made itself heard. It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite. How his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty! She lay as if asleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle. Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive. The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror.“Just Heaven!”cried she,“my deliverance is at hand! Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if you pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.”The tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up the glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall, where she covered herself with a large cloak. Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said,“My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided you to me, and put an end to my sorrows. On the self- same day when they end, shall your happiness begin. You are the husband chosen for me by Heaven, and shall pass your life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession. Seat yourself, and listen to the story of my life:

“I am the daughter of a rich count. My parents died when I was still in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will to my elder brother, by whom I was brought up. We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives. In our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one. So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night. We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories. My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented. We did not rise from table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in my soft bed. Hardly had I slept for a short time, when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me. As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force. I felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound. In the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted. He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart. My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer. He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room. I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning. When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak.

“I at once suspected nothing good. I dressed myself quickly, ordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one servant, rode full gallop to the forest. The servant fell with his horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its foot. I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes I saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which he led by a cord. I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing. Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly. I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse's head. I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness.

“When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin. The magician appeared once again, and said he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all that belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had shut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all turned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles. He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form. I answered him as little as I had done the first time. He vanished and left me in my prison, in which a deep sleep came on me. Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw you, and beheld my dream fulfilled. Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions. The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.”

As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air. Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity. After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone. The maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people. Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the selfsame day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor.





The Peasant in Heaven


Once on a time a poor pious peasant died, and arrived before the gate of heaven. At the same time a very rich, rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven. Then Saint Peter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the great man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut the door again. And now the peasant outside, heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing, and how they were making music, and singing within. At length all became quiet again, and Saint Peter came and opened the gate of heaven, and let the peasant in. The peasant, however, expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also, but all remained quite quiet; he was received with great affection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no one sang. Then the peasant asked Saint Peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth. Then said Saint Peter,“By no means, you are just as dear to us as any one else, and will enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys, but poor fellows like you come to heaven every day, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years!”





The Nix of the Mill-Pond


There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment. They had money and land, and their prosperity increased year by year more and more. But ill-luck comes like a thief in the night, as their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by year, and at last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived, his own. He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day's work, found no rest, but tossed about in his bed, full of care.

One morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air, thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter. As he was stepping over the mill-dam the first sunbeam was just breaking forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond. He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water. Her long hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell down on both sides, and covered her white body. He soon saw that she was the Nix of the Mill-pond, and in his fright did not know whether he should run away or stay where he was. But the nix made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and asked him why he was so sad? The miller was at first struck dumb, but when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do.“Be easy,”answered the nix,“I will make you richer and happier than you have ever been before, only you must promise to give me the young thing which has just been born in your house.”

“What else can that be,”thought the miller,“but a young puppy or kitten?”and he promised her what she desired. The nix descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his mill, consoled and in good spirits. He had not yet reached it, when the maid-servant came out of the house, and cried to him to rejoice, for his wife had given birth to a little boy. The miller stood as if struck by lightning; he saw very well that the cunning nix had been aware of it, and had cheated him. Hanging his head, he went up to his wife's bedside and when she said,“Why do you not rejoice over the fine boy?”he told her what had befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the nix.“Of what use to me are riches and prosperity?”he added,“if I am to lose my child; but what can I do?”Even the relations, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not know what to say.

In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller's house. All that he undertook succeeded, it was as if presses and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money multiplied nightly in the cupboards. It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before. But he could not rejoice over it untroubled, for the bargain which he had made with the nix tormented his soul. Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt. He never let the boy himself go near the water.“Beware,”he said to him,“if you do but touch the water, a hand will rise, seize you, and draw you down.”But as year after year went by and the nix did not show herself again, the miller began to feel at ease.

The boy grew up to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman. When he had learnt everything, and had become an excellent huntsman, the lord of the village took him into his service. In the village lived a beautiful and true-hearted maiden, who pleased the huntsman, and when his master perceived that, he gave him a little house, the two were married, lived peacefully and happily, and loved each other with all their hearts.

One day the huntsman was chasing a roe; and when the animal turned aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued it and at last shot it. He did not notice that he was now in the neighbourhood of the dangerous mill-pond, and went, after he had disembowelled the stag, to the water, in order to wash his blood-stained hands. Scarcely, however, had he dipped them in than the nix ascended, smilingly wound her dripping arms around him, and drew him quickly down under the waves, which closed over him.

When it was evening, and the huntsman did not return home, his wife became alarmed. She went out to seek him, and as he had often told her that he had to be on his guard against the snares of the nix, and dared not venture into the neighbourhood of the mill-pond, she already suspected what had happened. She hastened to the water, and when she found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore, she could no longer have any doubt of the misfortune. Lamenting her sorrow, and wringing her hands, she called on her beloved by name, but in vain. She hurried across to the other side of the pond, and called him anew; she reviled the nix with harsh words, but no answer followed. The surface of the water remained calm, only the crescent moon stared steadily back at her.

The poor woman did not leave the pond. With hasty steps, she paced round and round it, without resting a moment, sometimes in silence, sometimes uttering a loud cry, sometimes softly sobbing. At last her strength came to an end, she sank down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep. Presently a dream took possession of her.

She was anxiously climbing upwards between great masses of rock;thorns and briars caught her feet, the rain beat in her face, and the wind tossed her long hair about. When she had reached the summit, quite a different sight presented itself to her; the sky was blue, the air soft, the ground sloped gently downwards, and on a green meadow, gay with flowers of every colour, stood a pretty cottage. She went up to it and opened the door; there sat an old woman with white hair, who beckoned to her kindly. At that very moment, the poor woman awoke, day had already dawned, and she at once resolved to act in accordance with her dream. She laboriously climbed the mountain; everything was exactly as she had seen it in the night. The old woman received her kindly, and pointed out a chair on which she might sit.“You must have met with a misfortune,”she said,“since you have sought out my lonely cottage.”With tears, the woman related what had befallen her.“Be comforted,”said the old woman,“I will help you. Here is a golden comb for you. Tarry till the full moon has risen, then go to the mill-pond, seat yourself on the shore, and comb your long black hair with this comb. When you have done, lay it down on the bank, and you will see what will happen.”

The woman returned home, but the time till the full moon came, passed slowly. At last the shining disc appeared in the heavens, then she went out to the mill-pond, sat down and combed her long black hair with the golden comb, and when she had finished, she laid it down at the water's edge. It was not long before there was a movement in the depths, a wave rose, rolled to the shore, and bore the comb away with it. In not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the bottom, the surface of the water parted, and the head of the huntsman arose. He did not speak, but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances. At the same instant, a second wave came rushing up, and covered the man's head. All had vanished, the mill-pond lay peaceful as before, and nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it.

Full of sorrow, the woman went back, but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old woman. Next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the wise woman. The old woman gave her a golden flute, and said,“Tarry till the full moon comes again, then take this flute; play a beautiful air on it, and when you have finished, lay it on the sand; then you will see what will happen.”

The wife did as the old woman told her. No sooner was the flute lying on the sand than there was a stirring in the depths, and a wave rushed up and bore the flute away with it. Immediately afterwards the water parted, and not only the head of the man, but half of his body also arose. He stretched out his arms longingly towards her, but a second wave came up, covered him, and drew him down again.

“Alas, what does it profit me?”said the unhappy woman,“that I should see my beloved, only to lose him again!”Despair filled her heart anew, but the dream led her a third time to the house of the old woman. She set out, and the wise woman gave her a golden spinning-wheel, consoled her and said,“All is not yet fulfilled, tarry until the time of the full moon, then take the spinning-wheel, seat yourself on the shore, and spin the spool full, and when you have done that, place the spinningwheel near the water, and you will see what will happen.”

The woman obeyed all she said exactly; as soon as the full moon showed itself, she carried the golden spinning-wheel to the shore, and span industriously until the flax came to an end, and the spool was quite filled with the threads. No sooner was the wheel standing on the shore than there was a more violent movement than before in the depths of the pond, and a mighty wave rushed up, and bore the wheel away with it. Immediately the head and the whole body of the man rose into the air, in a water-spout. He quickly sprang to the shore, caught his wife by the hand and fled. But they had scarcely gone a very little distance, when the whole pond rose with a frightful roar, and streamed out over the open country. The fugitives already saw death before their eyes, when the woman in her terror implored the help of the old woman, and in an instant they were transformed, she into a toad, he into a frog. The flood which had overtaken them could not destroy them, but it tore them apart and carried them far away.

When the water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again, they regained their human form, but neither knew where the other was;they found themselves among strange people, who did not know their native land. High mountains and deep valleys lay between them. In order to keep themselves alive, they were both obliged to tend sheep. For many long years they drove their flocks through field and forest and were full of sorrow and longing.

When spring had once more broken forth on the earth, they both went out one day with their flocks, and as chance would have it, they drew near each other. They met in a valley, but did not recognize each other;yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so lonely. Henceforth they each day drove their flocks to the same place; they did not speak much, but they felt comforted. One evening when the full moon was shining in the sky, and the sheep were already at rest, the shepherd pulled the flute out of his pocket, and played on it a beautiful but sorrowful air. When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly.“Why are you weeping?”he asked.“Alas,”answered she,“thus shone the full moon when I played this air on the flute for the last time, and the head of my beloved rose out of the water.”He looked at her, and it seemed as if a veil fell from his eyes, and he recognized his dear wife, and when she looked at him, and the moon shone in his face she knew him also. They embraced and kissed each other, and no one need ask if they were happy.





The Little Folks' Presents


A tailor and a goldsmith were travelling together, and one evening when the sun had sunk behind the mountains, they heard the sound of distant music, which became more and more distinct. It sounded strange, but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards. The moon had already arisen when they reached a hill on which they saw a crowd of little men and women, who had taken each other's hands, and were whirling round in the dance with the greatest pleasure and delight. They sang to it most charmingly, and that was the music which the travellers had heard. In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest. He wore a parti-coloured coat, and his iron-grey beard hung down over his breast. The two remained standing full of astonishment, and watched the dance. The old man made a sign that they should enter, and the little folks willingly opened their circle. The goldsmith, who had a hump, and like all hunchbacks was brave enough, stepped in; the tailor felt a little afraid at first, and held back, but when he saw how merrily all was going, he plucked up his courage, and followed. The circle closed again directly, and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps. The old man, however, took a large knife which hung to his girdle, whetted it, and when it was sufficiently sharpened, he looked round at the strangers. They were terrified, but they had not much time for reflection, for the old man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed, shaved the hair of his head clean off, and then the same thing happened to the tailor. But their fear left them when, after he had finished his work, the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner, as much as to say, they had behaved well to let all that be done to them willingly, and without any struggle. He pointed with his finger to a heap of coals which lay at one side, and signified to the travellers by his gestures that they were to fill their pockets with them. Both of them obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coals would be to them, and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night. When they had got into the valley, the clock of the neighbouring monastery struck twelve, and the song ceased. In a moment all had vanished, and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight.

The two travellers found an inn, and covered themselves up on their straw-beds with their coats, but in their weariness forgot to take the coals out of them before doing so. A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual. They felt in the pockets, and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coals, but with pure gold; happily, too, the hair of their heads and beards was there again as thick as ever. They had now become rich folks, but the goldsmith, who, in accordance with his greedy disposition, had filled his pockets better, was as rich again as the tailor. A greedy man, even if he has much, still wishes to have more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should wait another day, and go out again in the evening in order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on the hill. The tailor refused, and said,“I have enough and am content; now I shall be a master, and marry my dear object (for so he called his sweetheart), and I am a happy man.”But he stayed another day to please him. In the evening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he might be able to stow away a great deal, and took the road to the hill. He found, as on the night before, the little folks at their singing and dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean, and signed to him to take some coal away with him. He was not slow about sticking as much into his bags as would go, went back quite delighted, and covered himself over with his coat.“Even if the gold does weigh heavily,”said he,“I will gladly bear that,”and at last he fell asleep with the sweet anticipation of waking in the morning an enormously rich man. When he opened his eyes, he got up in haste to examine his pockets, but how amazed he was when he drew nothing out of them but black coals, and that howsoever often he put his hands in them.“The gold I got the night before is still there for me,”thought he, and went and brought it out, but how shocked he was when he saw that it likewise had again turned into coal. He smote his forehead with his dusty black hand, and then he felt that his whole head was bald and smooth, as was also the place where his beard should have been. But his misfortunes were not yet over; he now remarked for the first time that in addition to the hump on his back, a second, just as large, had grown in front on his breast. Then he recognized the punishment of his greediness, and began to weep aloud. The good tailor, who was wakened by this, comforted the unhappy fellow as well as he could, and said,“You have been my comrade in my travelling time; you shall stay with me and share in my wealth.”He kept his word, but the poor goldsmith was obliged to carry the two humps as long as he lived, and to cover his bald head with a cap.





The Nail


A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver. Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away. At noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said,“A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left hind foot.”

“Let it be wanting,”answered the merchant;“the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go. I am in a hurry.”In the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stableboy went into the room to him and said,“Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse's left hind foot. Shall I take him to the blacksmith?”

“Let it still be wanting,”answered the man;“the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain. I am in haste.”He rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at night.“And that unlucky nail,”said he to himself,“has caused all this disaster.”

The more haste the less speed.





The Peasant and the Devil


There was once on a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about. The best story is, however, how he once got hold of the Devil, and made a fool of him.

The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals.“You do indeed sit upon a treasure!”said the peasant.

“Yes, in truth,”replied the Devil,“on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than you have ever seen in your life!”“The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me,”said the peasant.

“It is yours,”answered the Devil,“if you will for two years give me the half of everything your field produces. Money I have enough of, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth.”The peasant agreed to the bargain.“In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division,”said he,“everything that is above ground shall belong to you, and what is under the earth to me.”The Devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips. Now when the time for harvest came, the Devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop; but he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips.“You have had the best of it for once,”said the Devil,“but the next time that won't do. What grows above ground shall be yours, and what is under it, mine.”

“I am willing,”replied the peasant; but when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat. The grain became ripe, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground. When the Devil came, he found nothing but the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks.“That is the way to cheat the Devil,”said the peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure.





The Drummer


A young drummer went out quite alone one evening into the country, and came to a lake on the shore of which he perceived three pieces of white linen lying.“What fine linen,”said he, and put one piece in his pocket. He returned home, thought no more of what he had found, and went to bed. Just as he was going to sleep, it seemed to him as if some one was saying his name. He listened, and was aware of a soft voice which cried to him,“Drummer, drummer, wake up!”As it was a dark night he could see no one, but it appeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed.“What do you want?”he asked.

“Give me back my dress,”answered the voice,“that you took away from me last evening by the lake.”

“You shall have it back again,”said the drummer,“if you will tell me who you are.”

“Ah,”replied the voice,“I am the daughter of a mighty King; but I have fallen into the power of a witch, and am shut up on the glass-mountain. I have to bathe in the lake every day with my two sisters, but I cannot fly back again without my dress. My sisters have gone away, but I have been forced to stay behind. I entreat you to give me my dress back.”

“Be easy, poor child,”said the drummer.“I will willingly give it back to you.”He took it out of his pocket, and reached it to her in the dark. She snatched it in haste, and wanted to go away with it.“Stop a moment, perhaps I can help you.”

“You can only help me by ascending the glass-mountain, and freeing me from the power of the witch. But you cannot come to the glass-mountain, and indeed if you were quite close to it you could not ascend it.”

“When I want to do a thing I always can do it,”said the drummer;“I am sorry for you, and have no fear of anything. But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain.”

“The road goes through the great forest, in which the man-eaters live,”she answered,“and more than that, I dare not tell you.”And then he heard her wings quiver, as she flew away.

By daybreak the drummer arose, buckled on his drum, and went without fear straight into the forest. After he had walked for a while without seeing any giants, he thought to himself,“I must waken up the sluggards,”and he hung his drum before him, and beat such a reveille that the birds flew out of the trees with loud cries. It was not long before a giant who had been lying sleeping among the grass, rose up, and was as tall as a fir-tree.“Wretch!”cried he;“what are you drumming here for, and wakening me out of my best sleep?”

“I am drumming,”he replied,“because I want to show the way to many thousands who are following me.”

“What do they want in my forest?”demanded the giant.

“They want to put an end to you, and cleanse the forest of such a monster as you art!”

“Oho!”said the giant,“I will trample you all to death like so many ants.”

“Do you think you can do anything against us?”said the drummer;“if you stoop to take hold of one, he will jump away and hide himself; but when you are lying down and sleeping, they will come forth from every thicket, and creep up to you. Every one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt, and with that they will beat in your skull.”The giant grew angry and thought,“If I meddle with the crafty folk, it might turn out badly for me. I can strangle wolves and bears, but I cannot protect myself from these earth-worms.”

“Listen, little fellow,”said he;“go back again, and I will promise you that for the future I will leave you and your comrades in peace, and if there is anything else you wish for, tell me, for I am quite willing to do something to please you.”

“You have long legs,”said the drummer,“and can run quicker than I; carry me to the glass-mountain, and I will give my followers a signal to go back, and they shall leave you in peace this time.”

“Come here, worm,”said the giant;“seat yourself on my shoulder, I will carry you where you wish to be.”The giant lifted him up, and the drummer began to beat his drum up aloft to his heart's delight. The giant thought,“That is the signal for the other people to turn back.”After a while, a second giant was standing in the road, who took the drummer from the first, and stuck him in his button-hole. The drummer laid hold of the button, which was as large as a dish, held on by it, and looked merrily around. Then they came to a third giant, who took him out of the button-hole, and set him on the rim of his hat. Then the drummer walked backwards and forwards up above, and looked over the trees, and when he perceived a mountain in the blue distance, he thought,“That must be the glass-mountain,”and so it was. The giant only made two steps more, and they reached the foot of the mountain, where the giant put him down. The drummer demanded to be put on the summit of the glass-mountain, but the giant shook his head, growled something in his beard, and went back into the forest.

And now the poor drummer was standing before the mountain, which was as high as if three mountains were piled on each other, and at the same time as smooth as a looking-glass, and did not know how to get up it. He began to climb, but that was useless, for he always slipped back again.“If one was a bird now,”thought he; but what was the good of wishing, no wings grew for him. Whilst he was standing thus, not knowing what to do, he saw, not far from him, two men who were struggling fiercely together. He went up to them and saw that they were disputing about a saddle which was lying on the ground before them, and which both of them wanted to have.“What fools you are,”said he,“to quarrel about a saddle, when you have not a horse for it!”

“The saddle is worth fighting about,”answered one of the men;“whosoever sits on it, and wishes himself in any place, even if it should be the very end of the earth, gets there the instant he has uttered the wish. The saddle belongs to us in common. It is my turn to ride on it, but that other man will not let me do it.”

“I will soon decide the quarrel,”said the drummer, and he went to a short distance and stuck a white rod in the ground. Then he came back and said,“Now run to the goal, and whoever gets there first, shall ride first.”Both put themselves into a trot; but hardly had they gone a couple of steps before the drummer swung himself on the saddle, wished himself on the glass-mountain, and before any one could turn round, he was there. On the top of the mountain was a plain; there stood an old stone house, and in front of the house lay a great fish-pond, but behind it was a dark forest. He saw neither men nor animals, everything was quiet; only the wind rustled amongst the trees, and the clouds moved by quite close above his head. He went to the door and knocked. When he had knocked for the third time, an old woman with a brown face and red eyes opened the door. She had spectacles on her long nose, and looked sharply at him; then she asked what he wanted.“Entrance, food, and a bed for the night,”replied the drummer.

“That you shall have,”said the old woman,“if you will perform three services in return.”

“Why not?”he answered,“I am not afraid of any kind of work, however hard it may be.”The old woman let him go in, and gave him some food and a good bed at night. The next morning when he had had his sleep out, she took a thimble from her wrinkled finger, reached it to the drummer, and said,“Go to work now, and empty out the pond with this thimble; but you must have it done before night, and must have sought out all the fishes which are in the water and laid them side by side, according to their kind and size.”

“That is strange work,”said the drummer, but he went to the pond, and began to empty it. He baled the whole morning; but what can any one do to a great lake with a thimble, even if he were to bale for a thousand years? When it was noon, he thought,“It is all useless, and whether I work or not it will come to the same thing.”So he gave it up and sat down. Then came a maiden out of the house who set a little basket with food before him, and said,“What ails you, that you sit so sadly here?”He looked at her, and saw that she was wondrously beautiful.

“Ah,”said he,“I cannot finish the first piece of work, how will it be with the others? I came forth to seek a king's daughter who is said to dwell here, but I have not found her, and I will go farther.”

“Stay here,”said the maiden,“I will help you out of your difficulty. You are tired, lay your head in my lap, and sleep. When you awake again, your work will be done.”The drummer did not need to be told that twice. As soon as his eyes were shut, she turned a wishing-ring and said,“Rise, water. Fishes, come out.”Instantly the water rose on high like a white mist, and moved away with the other clouds, and the fishes sprang on the shore and laid themselves side by side each according to his size and kind. When the drummer awoke, he saw with amazement that all was done. But the maiden said,“One of the fish is not lying with those of its own kind, but quite alone; when the old woman comes to-night and sees that all she demanded has been done, she will ask you, ‘What is this fish lying alone for? ' Then throw the fish in her face, and say, ‘This one shall be for you, old witch.'”

In the evening the witch came, and when she had put this question, he threw the fish in her face. She behaved as if she did not remark it, and said nothing, but looked at him with malicious eyes.

Next morning she said,“Yesterday it was too easy for you, I must give you harder work. To-day you must hew down the whole of the forest, split the wood into logs, and pile them up, and everything must be finished by the evening.”She gave him an axe, a mallet, and two wedges. But the axe was made of lead, and the mallet and wedges were of tin. When he began to cut, the edge of the axe turned back, and the mallet and wedges were beaten out of shape. He did not know how to manage, but at midday the maiden came once more with his dinner and comforted him.“Lay your head on my lap,”said she,“and sleep; when you awake, your work will be done.”She turned her wishing-ring, and in an instant the whole forest fell down with a crash, the wood split, and arranged itself in heaps, and it seemed just as if unseen giants were finishing the work. When he awoke, the maiden said,“Do you see that the wood is piled up and arranged, one bough alone remains; but when the old woman comes this evening and asks you about that bough, give her a blow with it, and say,‘That is for you, you witch.'”

The old woman came,“There you see how easy the work was!”said she;“but for whom hast you have that bough which is lying there still?”

“For you, you witch,”he replied, and gave her a blow with it. But she pretended not to feel it, laughed scornfully, and said,“Early to-morrow morning you shall arrange all the wood in one heap, set fire to it, and burn it.”

He rose at break of day, and began to pick up the wood, but how can a single man get a whole forest together? The work made no progress. The maiden, however, did not desert him in his need. She brought him his food at noon, and when he had eaten, he laid his head on her lap, and went to sleep. When he awoke, the entire pile of wood was burning in one enormous flame, which stretched its tongues out into the sky.“Listen to me,”said the maiden,“when the witch comes, she will give you all kinds of orders; do whatever she asks you without fear, and then she will not be able to get the better of you, but if you are afraid, the fire will lay hold of you, and consume you. At last when you have done everything, seize her with both your hands, and throw her into the midst of the fire.”

The maiden departed, and the old woman came sneaking up to him.“Oh, I am cold,”said she,“but that is a fire that burns; it warms my old bones for me, and does me good! But there is a log lying there which won't burn, bring it out for me. When you have done that, you are free, and may go where you like, come; go in with a good will.”The drummer did not reflect long; he sprang into the midst of the flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe a hair of his head. He carried the log out, and laid it down. Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the King's daughter. But the old woman laughed venomously, and said,“You think you have her safe, but you have not got her yet!”Just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the youth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up on high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed over her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be burnt.

Then the King's daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw that he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said,“You have ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything for yours. Promise to be true to me, and you shall be my husband. We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here.”She led him into the house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman's treasures. The maiden left the gold and silver where it was, and took only the precious stones. She would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her,“Seat yourself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like birds.”

“I do not like the old saddle,”said she,“I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.”

“Very well, then,”answered the drummer,“then wish us in front of the town-gate.”In the twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said,“I will just go to my parents and tell them the news, wait for me outside here, I shall soon be back.”

“Ah,”said the King's daughter,“I beg you to be careful. On your arrival do not kiss your parents on the right cheek, or else you will forget everything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and deserted.”

“How can I forget you?”said he, and promised her to come back very soon, and gave his hand upon it.

When he went into his father's house, he had changed so much that no one knew who he was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain had been three years. Then he made himself known, and his parents fell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said, and kissed them on both cheeks. But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek, every thought of the King's daughter vanished from him. He emptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table. The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches. Then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were going to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said,“I have found a maiden for you, and the wedding shall be in three days. The son was content to do as his parents desired.”

The poor King's daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man. When evening came, she said,“He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.”Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father's court. Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man's house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her. At length she heard the people saying,“The wedding will take place to-morrow.”Then she said,“I will try if I can win his heart back.”On the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her wishing-ring, and said,“A dress as bright as the sun.”Instantly the dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams. When all the guests were assembled, she entered the hall. Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress, and the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her.“Not for money,”she answered,“but if I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where your betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.”The bride could not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a sleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night, which made him fall into a deep sleep, When all had become quiet, the King's daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,





“Drummer, drummer, I pray you hear!

Have you forgotten you held me dear?

That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?

That I rescued your life from the witch's power?

Did you not plight your troth to me?

Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”





But it was all in vain, the drummer did not awake, and when morning dawned, the King's daughter was forced to go back again as she came.

On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said,“A dress as silvery as the moon.”When she appeared at the feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again excited the desire of the bride,and the King's daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second night also, outside the door of the bedroom. Then in the stillness of the night, she cried,





“Drummer, drummer, I pray you hear!

Have you forgotten your held me dear?

That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?

That I rescued your life from the witch's power?

Did you not plight your troth to me?

Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”





But the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught, could not be aroused. Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest. But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the strangermaiden, and told the bridegroom about it. They told him also that it was impossible that he could hear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry had poured a sleeping-draught into his wine. On the third evening, the King's daughter turned her wishing-ring, and said,“A dress glittering like the stars.”When she showed herself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself with the splendour of the dress, which far surpassed the others, and she said,“I must, and will have it.”The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom's door. The bridegroom, however, did not drink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed, but poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he heard a sweet voice which called to him,





“Drummer, drummer, I pray you hear!

Have you forgotten you held me dear?

That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?

That I rescued your life from the witch's power?

Did you not plight your troth to me?

Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”





Suddenly, his memory returned to him.“Ah,”cried he,“how can I have acted so unfaithfully; but the kiss which in the joy of my heart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame for it all, that is what stupefied me!”He sprang up, took the King's daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents' bed.“This is my true bride,”said he;“if I marry the other, I shall do a great wrong.”The parents, when they heard how everything had happened, gave their consent. Then the lights in the hall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought, friends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself satisfied.





The Golden Key


In the winter time, when deep snow lay on the ground, a poor boy was forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood. When he had gathered it together, and packed it, he wished, as he was so frozen with cold, not to go home at once, but to light a fire and warm himself a little. So he scraped away the snow, and as he was thus clearing the ground, he found a tiny, golden key. Hereupon he thought that where the key was, the lock must be also, and dug in the ground and found an iron chest.“If the key does but fit it!”thought he;“no doubt there are precious things in that little box.”He searched, but no keyhole was there. At last he discovered one, but so small that it was hardly visible. He tried it, and the key fitted it exactly. Then he turned it once round, and now we must wait until he has quite unlocked it and opened the lid, and then we shall learn what wonderful things were lying in that box.
