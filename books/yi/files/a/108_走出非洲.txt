《走出非洲》英文版







路西法的女儿（代译序）


剧透是不厚道的。即使由作者或译者本人亲自操作，仍然如此。

说到《走出非洲》，也许你心中出现的形象是梅丽尔·斯特里普。这部依据凯伦·布里克森同名自传体小说改编的电影拍摄于1985年，大受好评，获奥斯卡金像奖十一项提名、七项大奖。里面壮丽的东非风光、荡气回肠的爱情令观众落过泪后不禁回头去翻阅小说。

必须承认，文字的影响力远弱过画面。看电影的多，读小说的少，大部分人对作者凯伦·布里克森都所知不多。这里说得太多，也许会减弱你看正文的兴趣。但如果我告诉你，关于她，一直有一个源远流长的传说，那就是：她曾与魔鬼立约。她向魔鬼索取了一件昂贵的事物，相应的，魔鬼拿走了她的父亲、她年少时的闺中好友、她的姐姐、她的婚姻、她的情人、她的孩子、她的农场、她的健康……她曾自称：我是路西法的女儿。(1)

到底是什么，值得用这样的高价来换？

也许，你也想知道。





凯伦其人


凯伦·布里克森出生于1885年。她祖父迪内森男爵是著名的冒险家，1830年参加过法国对北非的征服。有后人开玩笑说，凯伦“在非洲有过一个祖父”。父亲威廉·迪内森1845年出生，是八兄弟姐妹中的第七人，没有继承到贵族头衔，却承继了冒险的精神；曾作为法国军官参加普法战争，也在威斯康星州进行毛皮交易——在当地留下了与奇普瓦印第安女子的后裔；后从政，以官员身份参加俄土战争。1879年，他在哥本哈根北面约二十五公里处的一个渔村买下了伦斯特德庄园，后来凯伦便在那里出生、去世，目前那里是布里克森纪念馆的一部分。他以本名及笔名出版了几本书，至今仍被认为是风格之作。

凯伦的母亲英博格·魏斯特霍勒茨出身丹麦富裕的中产家庭。他们的婚姻不够恩爱，但也没到水火不容的程度。威廉后来患梅毒，长期住在一家疗养院里，在凯伦10岁那年悬梁自缢而死。究其原因，应该是政治挫折、永远不会痊愈的梅毒导致的身心残疾及长期抑郁。

那之后的凯伦和母亲的家族住在一起，过着无忧无虑的富家女生活，随家人去挪威度假，学滑雪，在巴黎学绘画。她很早就展现出文学与艺术上的天赋，发表过作品，也曾在法国开过画展，但都没引起反响。估计在大部分人眼中，这就相当于大观园中小姐们的写写画画，只是玩儿，不值得认真对待。

她深爱母亲这边的家人，但对父亲那边的贵族亲戚，则十二分之仰慕。毕竟当时还没有电影明星，天天在报章上抛头露面的贵族，一举一动都万人追捧，就是那时代的明星。不必责备她这小小的虚荣心。据记录，光在1900年，就有五百位富裕的美国女性嫁给欧洲贵族。显然，这也会是凯伦的选择。毕竟，富有中产阶级的女儿嫁给贵族，是一种流行，也是一桩体面的、双方获益的婚姻。

1909年，24岁的凯伦爱上小她两岁的远房表弟汉斯·冯·布里克森男爵，但对方反应冷淡。四年后，她嫁给了汉斯的孪生弟弟布洛尔·冯·布里克森男爵，成为男爵夫人。

她是为了男爵夫人的头衔结婚的吗？诚实地说：是。甚至她在新婚期间即被丈夫传染上梅毒，她还在给弟弟托马斯的信中写道：“说句够粗鲁的话，只付出这么点儿代价就得到头衔，很值哦。”——“这么点儿”？她还不知道，这将意味着她一生的健康与幸福。

婚后不久，在一位夫妇俩共同亲戚（布洛尔的舅舅，凯伦的表叔）的建议下，由凯伦娘家出资，他们在肯尼亚买了一座农场，开始了咖啡种植园主的生涯。1913年，凯伦踏上了非洲大地，直到1931年，一败涂地，黯然离开。

十八年间，第一个问题是健康：她长期被梅毒困扰，多次赴欧洲治疗，但一直未愈。青霉素尚未发明，当时主要使用的含汞和砷的药物，给她带来终生的重金属慢性中毒和上瘾。这期间，她还先后感染过疟疾、西班牙流感等。

第二个问题是婚姻。布洛尔艳遇无数，又挥金如土，把凯伦娘家提供的、本该用在农场上的资金挥霍一空。他也许不算个坏人——在那个时代，他的轻浮好色、酗酒贪杯都是可以原谅的“男人的错”。他在1919年提出离婚，凯伦不同意，且努力想挽回婚姻，甚至想与布洛尔生个孩子。最终，两人在1921年正式分居，1925年离婚生效。在这段破裂婚姻中，凯伦算是无辜方。据她弟弟托马斯说，凯伦对性的态度“极端保守”。没有资料能证明她在正式分居前有过外遇。

第三个问题是孩子。凯伦一直没有孩子。她出版《走出非洲》时用的笔名是“以萨克·迪内森”。有评论家认为“以萨克”是出于《圣经》里的以撒。上帝怜恤亚伯拉罕与妻子撒拉无子，准让撒拉生育。当时撒拉已经90岁，觉得不可能，说“我和我主都老了”，大笑，后得子，取名“以撒”，便为“大笑”意。此观点不知出处何在，至少凯伦自己从没这么说过，但多少不是空穴来风，侧面证实了她求子之心的强烈。根据她与家人的信件，她曾两次怀孕，一次为1923年，另一次为1926年。曾在报过喜讯之后，有一封令人神伤的信：“我不知道如果真有了孩子会如何，也永远不会知道了……”发生了什么？是自愿流产还是被迫堕胎？幸好传记作家倾向于前者。

第四个问题是感情生活。1918年，凯伦与丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿在穆海迦俱乐部认识，丹尼斯成为他们夫妇共同的朋友。直到1925年，凯伦正式离婚后，丹尼斯住进她家，即书中提到的：“丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿在非洲除了我的农场之外，没有别的住址。每两次远征狩猎期间，他总住在我家，他的书和唱片都存在这里。”——这是否意味着我们这个时代的同居？难说。凯伦一直用“友谊”形容这段关系。著有《夜航西飞》的女作家柏瑞尔·马卡姆是丹尼斯的朋友，始终认为他与凯伦之间没有性关系，因为丹尼斯是同性恋。但凯伦的孩子确实是丹尼斯的，她与丹尼斯商量过。而丹尼斯的答复是：“或者，你可以把‘丹尼尔’删掉。”丹尼尔是这个可能出生的孩子的名字吗？删掉是指堕胎吗？传记作家争论不休，但有一点可以确定，丹尼斯从来没打算跟她结婚。

不过有一件事，丹尼斯做得很仗义。1928年，威尔士亲王访肯，布洛尔·布里克森男爵和丹尼斯一道负责接待。布洛尔已经再婚，殖民地上出现了新的男爵夫人，可想而知凯伦的微妙地位。显然是为了帮她撑门面，丹尼斯想办法安排了威尔士亲王对农场的访问。这次到访对凯伦很重要，她在书中几次提到。

这是爱情吗？凯伦的部分粉丝强烈反对电影《走出非洲》里面的描写，坚持认为凯伦不曾“迷恋”丹尼斯，而是“她爱丹尼斯，但她也爱非洲大陆、原住民和野生动物”。爱到底有几个名字？爱与爱是否完全一样？

第五个问题，其实是这一切问题的核心，经济问题。十八年间，农场一直亏损，原因有布洛尔早期的挥霍、蝗灾、旱灾、1923年咖啡加工厂火灾、一战带来的经济衰退、国际汇率大幅变更、咖啡价格下降、农场上不断变换经济作物……但根本原因是凯伦不懂农业。

她在书中几度抱怨农场地势太高，不适于咖啡种植。没错，科学家们后来证实了她的农场确实不适于咖啡，因为地势太低了——这是个笑话吗？当然，只要不是发生在你我或者我们爱的人身上。

能怪她吗？不。她是被当作女结婚员培养长大的，从来没想过要当女农业科学家。

至于其他的问题，比如说，在英国殖民地上，作为外国人，又被误会是亲德派，受到了冷落排挤；长期的无依无靠，身与心的极端孤独；还有1917年，她表妹兼最好的女友自杀身亡；1921年，她唯一的姐姐因病去世……

弟弟托马斯来农场考察过之后，认为已经无回旋余地。1931年，她的家人强烈要求她卖掉农场。她屈服了，农场已经出手，她还在处理未尽事宜时，丹尼斯因飞机坠毁身亡。

……一切都结束了。

返回丹麦后，新的考验还在等待她。

在非洲期间，为了不让自己沉浸于自怜，她一直没停止过写作。现在她已经47岁，还是文坛新人，有的出版商认为书写得不错，但不想出“欧洲作家的处女作”。更有出版商根本一眼都不看：这早已是少年才俊的天下。

1937年，《走出非洲》出版，52岁的她声名鹊起。随即二战爆发，丹麦被德国占领。成为二等公民的种种屈辱和不便令她内心十分痛苦。战争也令出版业几乎停滞，读者购买力急剧下降，以前的版税拿不到，新书难以出版。1942年写的书，历尽千辛万苦，耗费九牛二虎之力，才投寄到伦敦和纽约。连合同和校样都没看到，书到底出版了没有，有没有读者买？不知道。此种境况一直持续到1945年战争结束。

和平了，多年笔耕不辍，终于开花结果。她扬名天下，玛丽莲·梦露都是她的粉丝，但她的身体撑不住了，梅毒的后遗症之一就是严重的神经痛，痛楚令她寝食难安，体重跌到三十五公斤上下。1949年，她因胃溃疡做了大手术，到1955年，她已经严重进食困难。

1957年，她被提名诺贝尔文学奖，但无缘折桂。当年获奖者是因《鼠疫》蜚声的加缪。

1962年，她因长期的病痛折磨去世，具体死因为严重营养不良，终年77岁。

如果你要问：她离开非洲后做了什么？就是标准的作家生活：写写写写写写写，偶尔出去走走；没有再婚，也没有恋爱。

而她身后留下什么？《走出非洲》《七个哥特式故事》《冬天的故事》《芭比特的盛宴》……

好了，现在你知道她向魔鬼要了什么吗？

也许她什么也没要。所谓与魔鬼立约，是西方一个源远流长的传说，帕格尼尼、莫扎特这类才华横溢的艺术家，都有过类似传闻。也许这一切，都不是凯伦自愿的选择，就像她在书中所说那样：“骄傲是对上帝创造我们时所怀期许的信仰。骄傲者能意识到这期许，接受使命且心领神会。……对他而言，成功便是将上帝的期许贯彻始终，并为自己的命运深感庆幸。”

在丹麦发行的1997系列钞票的五十克朗纸币上印有她的头像。而她也是除王室成员之外，唯一一个两次出现在邮票上的人物，这两次分别是1980年和1996年。





《走出非洲》其书


《走出非洲》是一部很特别的书。一方面，作者信手拈来，想到哪里写到哪里；另一方面，到了最后，你才恍然发现这里面暗含的结构像《一千零一夜》般环环相扣。

同样特别的还有作者的无所不说和绝对的沉默。她明明是唯一的女主角，但是关于婚姻状态、对孩子的渴求、身体的病患，都只在最万不得已的情况下，透露一两句，内敛羞怯到难以想象的程度。另一个角度，就是对非洲的所有细节：雨季的咖啡花、园子里飞来的犀鸟、原住民小孩们的名字……一一道来，处处诚实无欺。

对于她，何者为重，何者为轻？她不说，她让读者自己去寻找答案。

她的写作风格影响过许多作家，诸如约翰·厄普代克、娜依斯·宁、卡森·麦卡勒斯、彼得·赫格（以《情系冰雪》知名的丹麦作家），其中最著名的是J．D．塞林格，在《麦田里的守望者》里面，他多次提及《走出非洲》。与她同时代的海明威在获得诺贝尔文学奖时曾表示：“更伟大的作家总是不会得诺奖，而如果奖项给了美丽的作家以萨克·迪内森（凯伦·布里克森），今天我会很高兴，很高兴很高兴……”美国作家杜鲁门·卡波特曾称赞《走出非洲》是二十世纪最唯美的一部作品。

到底他们说的对不对，看过书，你就知道了。





几点说明


我个人觉得，“走出非洲”是一个不太妥当的译名，精准的译名应为“失非洲”。布里克森说的不是走出非洲的过程，而是缅怀失非洲的历程。但已约定俗成，我决定从俗。

凯伦是一个知识广博的智慧女性，原著出现大量引文，有法文、德文、拉丁文、丹麦文、瑞典文，甚至意大利文，凡能查到出处的，皆以注解方式列在书内。

书中所涉及人物，其简介能控制在百字之内的，都在书内注解；字数较多的，则以小传方式附录于书后《假如你还想知道更多》内。

内文引用的《圣经》词句，大部分选用和合本翻译；莎士比亚戏剧引文，大部分选自朱生豪译本。

再闲话几句：从我着手准备翻译，到最后完工，前后耗时将近一年——如果是一场怀胎十月，现在已经有婴儿在抱。

译的过程中，我一直在问自己：值不值得？值不值得？这么多的时间，这么艰苦的寻寻觅觅，这么少的钱……

到最后，我不问了，我明白：翻译，其实就是一场最深的阅读。你看到了，似懂非懂，你认识每个字母，但不理解作者到底想说什么。为了这本书，我读了我能找到的所有资料——多么感谢互联网，提供了海量知识。我甚至狠下心，买了二手的原版书——原版新书太贵，买不起。到最后，我可能是懂了，于是我努力地试着把这“懂”也告诉你。

而在写作之重与阅读之轻之间，很庆幸，我成为搭桥的人。

再次从俗：才疏学浅，书中必有错漏之处，若有指正，请联系我qingcheng0078@vip.163.com。

卡曼特与露露


“从森林中和高原上，我们来了，我们来了。”





恩贡农场


我从前在非洲有个农场，就在恩贡山脚下。农场海拔一千八百米，从它向北一百六十千米处，赤道横穿高原。白日里，你会觉得身在极高处，太阳触手可及，拂晓与薄暮却闲适清澈。夜间很冷。

它的地理位置以及海拔共同绘制出一幅世界上独一无二的画卷。土地并不肥沃，哪里都不流蜜与奶油；这是被一千八百米海拔净化过的非洲，是这片大地朴质且微妙的精华所在。色调总是干枯灼黑，像陶器上的色彩。树冠都轻盈细致，树形也不像欧洲树木般生成拱门状或圆顶形，而是呈水平状。那些孤零零矗立着的参天大树像棕榈树，或者满载的船，风帆早已卷起，周身笼罩着史诗般的浪漫气息。树林的尽头形状飘忽不定，仿佛整片林子在轻轻摇晃。一望无尽的草原上，散布着歪歪倒倒的荆棘树，全是老树枯藤，光秃秃的。草叶闻起来像百里香和沼泽桃金娘，有些地方气味馥郁得几乎冲鼻子。无论平原上的万千花朵，抑或原始森林里的藤蔓和攀缘植物都和低地植物一般小巧——只在漫长雨季开始的时候，大朵的、芬芳四溢的百合花会瞬间绽放。一望无际，一切你眼中所见，都生而庄严自由，有着无与伦比的尊贵意味。

一旦生活于此，你感受最深的一定是这里的空气。每一次回首非洲高原的旅居岁月，那种似乎生活在云端的感觉会深深震撼你。天色是淡薄的蓝或紫，云朵澎湃，既厚重又轻若无物，云头高高扬起，仿佛即将扬帆远走。天色的蔚蓝里蕴藏着勃勃的生机力量，为不远处的群山树林染上一抹新鲜的深蓝。正午时分，地面上的空气躁动起来，仿佛燃烧的焰影；它闪烁着，摇曳着，流光如大河奔腾，它映照一切，使万事万物都形影相对，缔造出壮观的海市蜃楼、仙世魔境。在高海拔的空气中，你呼吸顺畅，脏腑间既轻盈又踌躇满志。每一个高原上的早晨即起，你都会想：我在这里，这是我应该停留的地方。




恩贡山脉南北走向，山脊连绵悠长，群山掩映着四座主峰，有如静峙的碧涛直刺长空。恩贡山脉海拔两千四百米，东边高出周围地区六百米；西边山势陡然下跌，更加险峻——最后笔直栽进东非大裂谷。

高原上的风常年来自东北偏北，那是从非洲和阿拉伯半岛吹下来的风。人们称这季风为“东风”，是所罗门王(1)爱马的名字。到这里能感觉到空气阻力，仿佛地球正把自己远远地掷入太空。大风向恩贡山扑面而来，山坡想必是绝佳的滑翔之地，滑翔机会迎风上冲，越过巅峰。浮云随风飘荡，滑过山之边缘，团团簇拥。有时，它被山尖戳破，瞬间化云为雨。而那些身在更高处的云彩则远远地离开山脉，向西方消散，下方是大裂谷燃烧般的沙漠。很多次，我从家里出发，追随着云彩的脚步，抬头仰望，它们如盛大的游行队伍。大团大团的浮云壮丽厚重，却一掠过山顶就融入碧蓝晴空，转眼消逝得无影无踪。这场面总令我惊叹不已。

从农场看去，每一天从早到晚，山峦的形貌与气质都变化多端。有时近在眼前，有时却好像远在天边。黄昏入夜，天色渐渐暗下来，当你凝视群山，起初你会看到似乎天空中有一条细细的银线，勾勒出黑暗群山的轮廓；之后，夜幕降临，四座主峰好像平坦了许多，不再险厄，仿佛山脉正动动脖子扭扭腰，伸展自己的身子。

从恩贡山极目远眺，景色举世无双。南边的广阔平原，是野生动物聚居之地，一望无际，一直延展到乞力马扎罗山；东边和北边则是平缓的山麓，风光精致如公园，身后就是森林；从这里到一百六十多千米外的肯尼亚山，山地崎岖不平，都是基库尤人(2)居留区——小块玉米田、香蕉林和草地像一方方马赛克，镶嵌成画。原住民村落，如好多尖顶的鼹鼠山(3)集聚在一起，这里那里，不时浮起淡蓝炊烟。朝西看去则是非洲低洼地带的地貌，荒凉缺水似月球表面。褐色沙漠偶有几丛零星荆棘点缀，蜿蜒的河床早已干涸，深绿色的林木如弯曲小径分布其上：高大的合欢树开枝散叶，遍体生满针刺；这里生长着仙人掌，也是长颈鹿和犀牛的家。

当你步入山间，你会发现它辽阔得惊人，景色如画，充满神秘韵味；间错着狭长的山谷、灌木丛、青翠的崖坡和陡峭的绝壁。在高处，高耸的山峰下还有一片竹林。山中有小溪和泉眼，我曾在附近野营过。

那个时候，恩贡山上居住着水牛、大角斑羚和犀牛。那些年长的当地人对曾在这儿栖居的大象仍记忆犹新。可惜恩贡山并未全山划在野生动物保护区内，让我深以为憾。其中只有一小部分禁猎，南部主峰上的灯塔标记着禁猎区的边界。彼时殖民地正蓬勃发展，首都内罗毕迅速成长为大型都市，恩贡山遂自然而然地成为一个无与伦比的猎场。我在非洲最后那几年，每逢星期日，许多年轻的内罗毕商贩都会跑到山区，骑着摩托车，见啥打啥。我相信大型动物已经渐渐离开山间，穿过荆棘丛生的石头地，去往更远的南方。

沿着山脊和四座高峰徒步行走是很轻松愉快的事。草丛低矮，一如草坪，不时有灰色石块戳出。沿着山脊，顺着峰起峰落，有一条兽群踩出来的羊肠小路，角度平缓，略呈“之”字形。一天早晨，我在山间露营，当我沿着这条小径信步走去的时候，赫然发现了新鲜的脚印和粪便，是大角斑羚刚刚留下的。这些性情温和的庞然大物一定是在日出时分来到这里的，鱼贯而行。你简直想不出来它们出现在此地的原因，除非是为了居高临下，俯瞰山下两侧的壮丽景象。




我们在农场种植咖啡。农场的地势有点儿高，咖啡很难顺利生长。我们从来没因为农场发过财，但咖啡园是这样一件事物：它紧紧抓住你，让你无法走开，随时随地都有事儿要做；你总是跟不上你的活计，永远就差一点儿。

荒凉且杂乱无章的原野上，这片田地铺展开来，种植井然有序，十分完美。后来，当我乘飞机翱翔在非洲上空，渐渐习惯从空中看到的农场，自家的咖啡园也就看得满心喜欢：在一片灰蒙蒙的绿色大地里，它一枝独秀，满目鲜绿。我就此意识到，人们对几何图案的热衷是多么强烈。内罗毕周边的所有村庄，特别是在城北，都与之相似。这里生活着一群人，每日孜孜不倦地思考讨论播种、剪枝以及采摘咖啡果的事情，晚上睡下，又开始苦思冥想如何发展咖啡加工厂。

咖啡的生长是一个漫长的过程，完全不像你想象中那样刷一下开花，又刷一下结果。年轻岁月里，你满怀希望，在瓢泼大雨的日子，把幼弱、闪闪发光的咖啡幼苗从温室里扛出。农场里每一个人每一双手都在田里，湿润土地上早已整整齐齐挖好了坑，把咖啡苗放进去，让它们长高长大；为它们砍下灌木枝，搭成厚厚的凉棚以阻挡阳光的直射。对咖啡苗来说，荫凉是它们应享的特殊优待。总得四五年之后咖啡树才能够有收成，这期间干旱、病害往往接连不断，而野草除之不尽，肆无忌惮地蔓延——一种叫“海盗旗”的豆荚类植物，狭长粗糙的果皮总是钩在你的衣服和袜子上。有些咖啡树种得不好，主根受了伤，一开花就死了。一公顷土地大概种一千五百多棵树，而我的咖啡园有两百四十公顷大小；黄牛拖着耕耘机，沿着树的行列在田地间来来回回，行程几千千米，默默等待着即将来临的犒赏。

咖啡园里有几幅图景美不胜收：雨季初来，盛放的花朵闪着微光，在迷雾及蒙蒙细雨中，宛如粉笔绘出的云朵笼罩在两百四十公顷咖啡园的上方。咖啡花有一种淡淡的、略带苦涩的芬芳，像黑刺李花。当大地被成熟的咖啡果染红，所有的妇女和孩子——当地人称作“图图”——都全部出动，和男人们一道，收割咖啡果。随后，大大小小的牛车全部整装待发，把咖啡豆运送到河边的工厂。我们的机器运行状态向来不稳定，但这工厂是我们自行设计筹建的，难免敝帚自珍。有一次，整座工厂在火灾中化为乌有，事后只得在废墟上重建。巨大的咖啡烘干机转呀转呀，在它的铁胃里咖啡豆互相摩擦，声音像海浪正在冲刷海岸上的卵石。有几次，咖啡烘干、准备出炉的时分正是子夜前后。那真是惊艳一刻，高大幽暗的厂房里挂满防风灯，处处结着蜘蛛网，遍地咖啡豆的外皮。在灯光下，一张张闪耀着兴奋的黑色脸孔围在烘干机周围。你会感觉到，整座工厂，在这不寻常的非洲之夜，宛如阿比西尼亚(4)人耳垂上一颗璀璨的宝石。随后，咖啡豆被脱壳、分级、手工分检过，然后装入麻袋，再用缝马鞍用的粗针大线将麻袋封口。

黎明将尽，夜色还昏蒙，我躺在床上，听见大车的声音。每辆车上，装满咖啡的麻袋垒得高高的，十二袋是一吨，十六头牛拉一辆车。它们上路了，沿长长的山路从工厂去往内罗毕火车站。一片叫喊吵嚷的声音，是车夫们跟在车旁边跑。我很高兴这一条路基本都是下坡，只有一处上坡，因为农场比内罗毕城地势高三百米。傍晚前后，我走出门来迎接返程的队伍。空空的大车前，牛累得低垂着头，一个疲惫不堪的小孩领着它们，倦透了的车夫手里的鞭子无力地拖曳在道路上的扬尘间。现在我们已经尽我们所能了。咖啡一两天后就要扬帆出海，我们只能祈祷它在伦敦拍卖市场上能交个好运气。

我有两千四百公顷土地，所以除了咖啡园之外还有大量的空地，其中一部分是原始森林，还有大概四百公顷是棚民(5)的地，他们称之为“自留地”。棚民都是原住民，和家人一道在白人农场里耕种一两公顷地，代价是每年要为农场劳动一定天数。我觉得棚民们看待这件事的视角是和我们不同的。归根结底，他们大部分都是生于斯长于斯，甚至可以上溯到他们的父辈。所以可能在他们看来，我才是住在他们土地上的棚民，只是地位较高而已。原住民的地可比农场里其他地方热闹丰富得多，一年中，随着时日更替，景象变幻多端。当你穿行在瑟瑟作响的高大青纱帐间，脚下是被踩得很硬实的细细田埂，玉米高过你头顶。收割马上就要开始了。地里的豆角也熟了，女人们负责采撷、打壳。豆秧和豆荚积成一堆后点火焚烧，所以某些特定的季节里，不时地，农场上随处冒出青烟。基库尤人还种番薯，蔓生的番薯秧匍匐满地，枝叶纠缠，宛如一张编织得很密实的草席。南瓜也多种多样，一个个墩实实的，通体斑点黄绿相间。

无论何时走进基库尤人的自留地，首先抢进眼帘的，往往是老妇人弯腰弓背的背影。正在耙田的她，看上去像只鸵鸟把头埋在沙里。基库尤人家家都有几幢尖顶茅草棚屋和库房，房与房之间的空地硬如水泥，整日都很热闹，晒玉米、挤羊奶，小孩和小鸡都跑得正欢。日已将晚，暮霭深蓝，我在原住民房子附近的番薯地里射击彩鸡鹑。叶片如穗的大树上，欧鸽发出嘹亮的咕咕欢唱。森林曾覆盖整片农场，现在只在自留地里零星可见，是当年的残存。

在农场上，我还有近千公顷的草地，长草离离，在强风中如海浪起伏，基库尤小放牛娃们在草地上放牧自家的牛群。寒冷时节，他们随身带着装满热炭的柳条筐，有时会引发草地大火，对农场来说，这可是不得了的祸患。干旱年景，斑马和大角斑羚时常下到农场的草地上。




内罗毕是我们的城镇所在，离我们二十千米，位于恩贡山脚下一处平坦土地上。总督府和市政厅都在此地，整个国家从这里被统治着。

城市几乎不可能不在你生活中占据一席之地，不管你对它是赞美有加，还是颇多怨言，都无甚差异。凭借一种意识的万有引力定律，它牵引着你的心。傍晚，从农场的某一处，我能看到城市上空那闪着微光的暮霭，让我的思绪随风飞去。曾经到过的欧洲大城市，此刻又历历在目。

我初到非洲时，这个国家还没有汽车，我们骑马或者乘坐六匹骡子拉的两轮车上内罗毕，进城后，把骡子安置在高原运输公司的马厩里。我在非洲那些年，内罗毕始终是一个杂糅的城市，新落成的石头建筑富丽堂皇，可是也有大片大片旧波纹钢搭起来的商铺、办公室和平房。光秃秃的街道上尘土飞扬，两旁夹立着长长的桉树。高等法院、原住民事务部及兽医部的办公室都脏乱得一塌糊涂，我对这些部门的职员膜拜到五体投地：他们居然能在这样炙热漆黑的小屋里完成任何公务。

但不管怎样，内罗毕是一座城市，在这里可以买东西，听消息，在宾馆吃中饭、吃大餐，在俱乐部跳舞。这是一个活色生香的地方，如流水般永不止歇，如幼兽般不断成长。它的面貌日新月异，你不过离开个几天去远征狩猎，回来时，新的总督府已经落成，是一幢华美荫凉的豪宅，舞厅陈设精良，花园美轮美奂。大饭店逐步建成，大型农业展览和花卉展都场面壮观，让人过目难忘。移民区的准精英剧团还不时上演轻快的情节剧，让城市生活更加有声有色。内罗毕在对你说：“尽情享用我吧，尽情享用时间——当我们再次相遇，你我都会老去，不再如此放浪形骸，如此贪得无厌。”我与内罗毕有深刻的默契，有一次我驱车穿过城市时想到：“如果没有内罗毕的街道，也就没有全世界。”

原住民与有色人种移民居住的城区比欧洲人的聚居区大得多。

斯瓦希里人(6)聚居区位于通往穆海迦俱乐部(7)的路边。从各方面来看，它都名誉不佳，委实俗艳、脏乱且生机勃勃，每时每刻，各种奇闻怪事层出不穷。绝大多数建筑都是用敲扁平的旧煤油桶铁皮搭成的，到处锈迹斑斑，整体像珊瑚礁或者风化的远古化石。现代文明的精神正缓缓从这个城区抽离，渐渐远逝。

索马里人聚居区则远离内罗毕，我估计与索马里妇女不抛头露面的风俗有关。我在非洲的那些日子里，曾有几位年轻标致的索马里女子住在市场街，全城皆知。她们聪明灵巧且颠倒众生，令索马里警方很是头疼。但规规矩矩的索马里妇女是从来不在城中现身的。索马里人聚居区四面无遮无拦，成日狂风大作，灰尘四起，这一定让索马里人想起了他们祖祖辈辈居住的大沙漠。欧洲人不管在同一地区住了多长时间，甚至住了好几代，都无法说服自己对游牧民族生活区周边的脏乱差视若无睹。索马里人的房子随意地散落在空地上，看上去仿佛是用一堆四英寸的长钉勉勉强强钉在一起，只能维持个把星期。然而，一旦步入其中，你定会大吃一惊，里面竟如此整齐清洁：笼罩在阿拉伯熏香的芬芳空气里，地上铺着精美的地毯，墙上挂着华丽的饰物，摆设着黄铜与银制的器皿，象牙柄短剑锐不可当。索马里妇女仪容庄重，举止端庄，生性乐观且热情好客，笑声如银铃般悦耳。我有一位索马里忠仆名叫法拉，他陪伴了我在非洲的每一天，我多次随他一起去索马里村庄出席盛宴，每次都觉得宾至如归。盛大的索马里婚礼是隆重的传统盛会。作为贵客，我被延入洞房，洞房的墙壁和婚床上都铺满了古老的闪光锦缎及刺绣织物。深黑眼眸的年轻新娘遍体丝绸，穿金戴银，那沉重的金银与琥珀首饰把她约束得直挺挺的，一动也不能动，身子僵硬得像元帅手中的权杖。

索马里人都是牲口贩子和足迹遍布肯尼亚的行商。为了运输货物，他们在村中养了一群灰色的小毛驴。我在那里还看到了骆驼：它们是沙漠的产物，高傲而坚韧不拔，能超越世间的所有苦难，有如仙人掌或者索马里人自身。

索马里人部落分歧极其严重，这给他们惹来很多灾祸。在这件事上，他们的感受和思维与其他人绝不一样。法拉隶属于哈泼-尤尼斯部落。因此出于私人感情，每遇纷争，我总站在哈泼-尤尼斯一边。一次，在索马里人聚居区爆发了一场真刀真枪的大战，对阵双方分别是杜尔巴-汉蒂斯部落和哈泼-乔洛部落，两方使用步枪和火把互相攻击，约有十或十二人丧生，直到政府出面干预才平息下来。法拉有一个同部落的年轻朋友，名叫赛义德，是个举止潇洒的小伙子，经常到农场来看他。一次，仆人们告诉我，赛义德去一个哈泼-乔洛人家做客，正遇到杜尔巴-汉蒂斯部落一个愣头青经过此地，对着屋子开了两枪，子弹穿透墙壁，射断了赛义德的腿。我听后真心难过，向法拉表达对他朋友不幸遭遇的慰问。——“什么？赛义德？”法拉气冲冲地咆哮道，“够便宜赛义德了。为什么他非得去哈泼-乔洛人家喝茶呢？”

印度人在内罗毕掌控着市场街的大型本地商业，印度富商们都在城外有小别墅：杰瓦杰、苏莱曼·卫杰、阿里迪那·维思若姆等。他们都偏爱石台阶、石栏杆、石花瓶等石艺品，用本地的一种软石刻成，雕工粗陋，看上去像孩子们用粉红色釉面砖搭出来的玩具房子。他们在花园里举办茶会，印度茶点的风味与别墅浑然一致。在非洲的印度人都是聪明、见多识广、举止优雅的人，也都是奸诈的商人。你永远无法预知，你将面对的是他生活中的样子，还是他作为公司老板的那一面。我曾经去过苏莱曼·卫杰的家，一天，当我看见他的商铺大院里竟然在降半旗，我问法拉：“是苏莱曼·卫杰死了吗？”“半死。”法拉说。我问：“他还半死就下半旗了？”“苏莱曼死了，”法拉说，“卫杰还活着。”




在开始管理农场之前，我极其迷恋狩猎，参加过无数次远征狩猎，但变成农妇后，我就把步枪放到一边了。

马赛人(8)是游牧民族，以养牲畜为生。他们是农场的近邻，就住在河对岸。隔一段日子，他们中就会有人到我家来，向我抱怨有狮子在为害牛群，求我为他们除害。只要有可能，我一定照办不误。有时，星期六，我会徒步到奥龙基平原上，打一两只斑马给我的农场工人们打牙祭。一长串基库尤少年，兴高采烈地尾随在我身后。在农场上我打鸟，彩鸡鹑和珍珠鸡都是美味。但是，有很多年，我不再参加任何远征狩猎了。

然而，在农场上，我们还是常常谈起往昔的那些远猎。宿营地在你的脑海里扎了根，仿佛你已在那里度过漫长的一生。你的马车在草原上轧出的一道车辙依然历历在目，你记得，如同记得一张朋友的脸。

远征狩猎期间，我见过一群野牛，共有一百二十九头，在铜红色的天穹下，自黎明的薄雾间，一头接一头走出来，它们这群黝黑、魁梧如钢铁铸就的巨兽，硕大的角在它们头上水平摇动着，它们好像不是一步步走近我，而是在我眼前被刹那间炼就，一完工就落地成行。我也见过一群大象穿行在密密的原始森林中，阳光从藤蔓的缝隙间点点滴滴射下来。大象们从容迈步，仿佛在世界尽头有个约会。世界尽头一定漫无边际，如同一块非常古老、极其珍贵的波斯地毯的边缘，绿、黄、黑棕色彼此交织。我也曾一次又一次屏息注视着长颈鹿们成群结队穿过草原，它们的趣致、独特及植物一般的沉静，让人晃眼不觉是一群动物，而仿佛是一种罕见的花卉，抽着长长的花柄，花瓣硕大无朋，还洒满斑点，这花之家族正缓缓向前。我还曾跟着两只犀牛在清晨闲荡，它们在黎明的冷空气里又打喷嚏又擤鼻子——如此寒意逼人，鼻子觉得不舒服吧？——看上去，它们像两块在山谷间滚动的巨石，棱角分明，且自得其乐。还有一次，我邂逅了一只雄狮，正是日出之前，残月当空，它刚完成杀戮，穿过灰色旷野回家去，它暗黑的身影投在闪着银辉的草尖上，被血染红的脸一直红到耳根。也有一次，我遇到的狮子正在狮子家族的前呼后拥下心满意足地午后小憩，短草如茵。在这片非洲狮的乐园里，金合欢树展开宽宽的枝叶，狮子就睡在它泉水般清凉柔和的荫下。

不管农场生涯多么沉闷，回想起这所有，都让人欢欣雀跃。大型动物都还在那儿呢，在属于它们自己的世界里；只要我想，随时可以去探访它们。它们近在咫尺，这就像生活中的一道光，给农场带来了鲜活热闹。法拉——虽然随着时间过去，他越来越对农庄事务上心——以及曾随我打过猎的原住民用人们，都日夜盼望着远征狩猎。

在野外，我学会了绝对不要突然动作。跟你打交道的这些生物是害羞且警觉的，天生就想避开人类，虽然你非常不希望它们如此。家畜永不会像野生动物一般沉着。开化了的人类已经失去静默的本能，必须学会安静，才能被荒原接纳。猎人，尤其是手持照相机的那一种，要学会的第一课就是缓慢移动的艺术，绝不轻举妄动。猎人不可以自行其是，必须顺依荒原的规则：风、颜色以及味道，彼此步调也得保持一致。有时猎物反反复复做同一个动作，猎人也得蹑足跟踪在后。

一旦你掌握了非洲的节奏，你会发现，它也深藏在非洲音乐里。当我与原住民打交道的时候，野外狩猎的经验也派上了用场。




男人天生要爱女人和女人味道，女人总归要迷恋男人和男人气概。同样，对南部国家和民族的敏感多情，是北欧人的特征。诺曼人(9)注定要爱上异国他乡，首选是法国，其次是英国。十八世纪的历史和小说里出现过的老派北国绅士总是在意大利、希腊和西班牙旅行，他们没有一丝一毫南方血统，却被那些与自己迥然不同的风景人事深深吸引，以至流连忘返。过往有多少德国及斯堪的纳维亚的画家、哲学家和诗人，他们第一次踏上佛罗伦萨和罗马时，都禁不住双膝着地，对南方顶礼膜拜。

这些性情急躁的人，却对异邦世界保持着荒谬至不可理喻的耐心。如同真正的男人不会被女人激怒；对女人来说，只要对方保有男子气质，就永远不会看不起他，不会将他拒之门外；这些冒冒失失的红发北欧佬对热带国家和民族有同样的恒久忍耐，无限量，无限期。他们对本国本族的无聊不能容忍，却忍受着非洲高原的干旱、高温中暑、牛群中的瘟疫蔓延、原住民用人的不合作，并且低声下气，忍气吞声。他们早就失去了独立的自我意识，只是不停寻找一切可能性，想锲入不友好的人群，力争与对方打成一片。南欧来客和混血儿从不这样做；相反，他们以之为耻，或者当作笑话。所以，硬汉子嘲笑痴情男，对男人缺乏耐心的理智女也对格里泽尔达(10)这般低眉顺眼的小女人嗤之以鼻。

说到我自己，从踏上非洲的第一个星期起，我就萌发了对原住民深厚的感情，这情意如此浓烈，不分老幼，不管男女，我全爱。对黑人种族的了解极大地拓宽了我的世界。设若有人对动物怀着与生俱来的恻隐之心，却在没有动物的地方长大，到人生晚年终有机会与动物们接触；或者一个人，天生喜欢树木，热爱森林，到20岁才第一次步入森林；或者一个人生来就有慧耳，对音乐无师自通，却意外地，长大成人后才第一次听到音乐；他们的情形与我类似。在遇见原住民之后，我全部的日常生活都倾注在这片壮美如同交响乐的大地之上。

先父曾在丹麦和法国军队中服役。当他还是杜帕尔驻军中一位年轻中尉的时候，他写信回家：“回到杜帕尔之后，我成为纵队军官。工作很辛苦，也很光荣。对战争的热爱和对其他事物的激情其实一样，你爱你的士兵，正如你爱年轻姑娘们——几近疯狂，却随时会见异思迁，这种事，姑娘们最清楚。对女人，一次只能爱一个，但对士兵的爱，却包含了整个团队，只要可能，就希望多多益善。”我和原住民之间正是如此。

与原住民结交并不容易。他们听力敏锐，天性敏感；一旦被吓着，便在一秒钟之内缩回自己的小世界，正如野生动物以迅雷不及掩耳之势从你身边消失——转眼间逃之夭夭。想从他们那里得到明确答复，是不可能的事，除非已经和他们混得很熟。对直截了当的问题，比如他有多少头牛，他总应对得躲躲闪闪：“跟我昨天告诉你的一样多。”这样的答法很伤欧洲人感情，就像这样的问法伤了原住民感情一样。如果我们对他们施压或者穷追不舍，要求他们对自己的所作所为给出一个解释，他们就尽可能地回避敷衍，顺嘴说一些荒谬幽默的白日梦话，把我们引进错误的迷宫。在这种局势下，甚至小孩都精于此道，表现出扑克高手的全部资质，不在乎你是高估还是低估他们手中的牌，只要你捉摸不透真正的底牌是什么。一旦我们干扰到原住民的存在，他们的表现就像蚂蚁一样——当有人把棍棒捅进蚁冢丘，蚂蚁大军会发挥出难以想象的顽强和坚毅，无声无息地迅速清除被损毁的部分——仿佛抹消一件不得体的行为。

我们手中到底握着什么样的危险，让他们害怕我们？我们始终不知，甚至无从想象。我私人觉得，他们对我们的恐惧，更多是那种你对平地一声巨响的惊恐，而非害怕痛苦或死亡。但这仍然不好说，因为原住民都精于伪装的艺术。黎明时分，在自留地间，你有时会看到一只彩鸡鹑蹿到你的马前，看上去像翅膀断了，惊慌失措，很怕被狗咬到。但事实上它翅膀完好无损，也不怕狗——一旦时机来临，随时会腾空而起。只不过，它的一窝小雏正在附近某处，它要把我们的注意力引开而已。就像彩鸡鹑一样，原住民也许只是假装怕我们，因为某种我们一无所知也猜无可猜的更深的恐惧。也可能他们这样对我们，只是一种拙劣的玩笑，这些腼腆的人儿对我们根本不曾心怀一丝惧意。跟白人比起来，原住民对于生活中的危险简直算是毫无知觉。狩猎途中，或者农场上，某个箭在弦上的紧张时刻，我与原住民伙伴们的目光相遇，那一刻我深深意识到何谓“身手相连，心隔天涯”。对于我们面前的危险，他们不仅无动于衷，还对我的提心吊胆感到莫名其妙。这使我不由得想到：也许，他们深处俗世生活，生活已成为他们细胞的一分子。他们与生活如此浑然一体，这是我们绝对做不到的。对于各种变动，他们都如鱼得水，徜徉在深海的鱼如何能理解我们对溺水的恐惧？这种确信，这种游泳的技能，他们与生俱来。我想，这是由于他们保有我们自祖辈起就丧失的常识。在所有的大陆上，唯有非洲，能传授给你：上帝就是魔鬼，神性与魔性共同生生不息。这并非双重无限，无限只是一元化的存在。基于此，原住民既不会根据外部因素干扰对人的认识，也不会把事物孤立看待。

狩猎中，农场上，我与原住民彼此的相知越来越加深稳固，成为一种人与人之间的关系。我们都是好朋友。我说服自己接受现实：我永远不会真正懂得他们，理解他们，他们却把我看得透透的。我还在犹豫不决，不曾下定决心，他们早已知道我最终的决定。一度，我在吉尔-吉尔有个小农场，在那里住的是帐篷。我经常在恩贡和吉尔-吉尔之间乘火车来回。我在吉尔-吉尔的时候，一旦下雨，就得仓促回家。返程站是基库尤站，离农场还有十六千米，我下车时，总发现一个仆人已经等在那儿，还带着一头骡子供我骑乘。当我问他们怎么会知道我回家了，他们会看向别处，表情很不自在，像被吓着了又像觉得无聊。假设一个聋人坚持要我们给他解释何谓旋律，估计我们也是一样满脸尴尬。

当原住民渐渐习惯了突如其来的喧哗和行动，萌生安全感之后，他们会对我们说很多，坦率程度远甚欧洲人。他们不可信任，但十分真诚。一个好名声——或称威望，在原住民世界里至关重要。一旦某时某刻，他们似乎会不约而同对你做出评价，之后再不会有人反对它。

有时，农场生活非常孤独，夜晚静滞，只听见钟摆的嘀嘀嗒嗒，仿佛你的生命也随之一点一滴流逝，那时候只盼着有个白人可以谈天说地。而每时每刻，我都能意识到原住民那令一切黯然失色的静默生命，与我自己的生命在不同的轨道上并行。两种存在，彼此呼应。

原住民就是有血有肉的、活生生的非洲。大裂谷之上高耸入云的隆戈诺特火山、河流两岸招展枝叶的合欢树、大象与长颈鹿并不比原住民本身更加非洲，也只是辽阔山河间小小的身影。这一切，人与物，都是同一个概念的不同表达，同一段旋律的多种变奏。并非异类原子的简单堆砌，而是同类原子的复杂汇聚，恰像橡树叶、橡子和橡木器具。我们白人穿着长靴，来去匆匆，与景致很不搭调。而原住民却与这片大地水乳交融。这些高高瘦瘦、黑肤黑眸的人们奔走着——总是一个接一个，因为当地大型交通要道也不过是狭窄的羊肠小道——耕作、放牛、开盛大舞会，或者给你讲故事，这就是非洲在徜徉，在舞蹈，在张开怀抱将你搂入怀。在高原上，你永难忘这样的诗句：

在原住民身上，

我发现了高贵。

移民却总是百无聊赖。



殖民地在变迁，从我住在那里到现在，已变得面目全非。我将尽量如实记下我的农场经历、我周围的乡野岁月、平原和林间的一些居民，或许也别有一种历史意趣吧。

一个原住民男孩


卡曼特是个基库尤小男孩，是一个棚民家的儿子。通常我跟棚民的孩子们都很熟，因为他们既为我在农场工作，也常在我房子周围的草地上放羊，一心认定那里可能有好玩的事发生。而卡曼特一定已在农场住了好几年，我才遇到他；我猜他多半是深居简出，像一只受伤的小兽。

一天，我骑马穿过农场的原野，无意中撞见他，他正在给家里放羊，是个肉眼能看到的最悲惨的小东西：头很大，身体却瘦小得怕人，膝盖和手肘都高高地突出来，像木棒上的结节疙瘩。他的双腿长满了深深的脓疮，从大腿一直烂到脚跟。在广阔原野上，他看上去格外弱小，让人深为震骇：这么多痛苦竟都被集中在这一小点身上。我停下来和他说话，他没理我，甚至像没看见我一样。那是一张扁平、瘦削、痛苦却有无限忍耐力的脸，双眼无神，像死人一样黯淡。看上去，他像没几星期活头了，你仿佛即将看到秃鹫，那永远与死神如影随形的大鸟，在他头顶上那惨白燃烧的空气中盘旋。我叫他第二天早上到大宅来，我试着给他治治看。

几乎每天早上九点到十点之间，我给农场上的人们看病。就像所有江湖医生一样，我有一大堆病人，通常，每次在我屋外候诊的，少则数人，多则一打。

基库尤人对于各种不测都安之若素，所有的意外都视同寻常。这方面，他们与白人大为不同，后者往往尽力躲开那未知的噩梦和厄运的袭击。而黑人呢，与命运和平相处，将自己的一生都放在命运女神手掌心，任她揉搓；某种意义上，他们的家就是命运的化身，棚屋里熟稔的黑暗，深深的泥土地是他们牢牢扎根的地方。面对生活中的一切变故，他们都能若无其事。我觉得，在雇主、医生以及上帝身上，他们所寻求的禀赋首推想象力。也许正是由于这种渴求，哈里发哈伦·阿里·拉希德(1)才能如此长治久安，在非洲人及阿拉伯人心中，他是最理想的统治者。和他在一起，谁也不知道还能祈求什么，另外，你也根本不知道到哪里去找他。当非洲人谈及上帝的诸般品格，就好像在述说《一千零一夜》或者《圣经·约伯记》的最后几章；这般天性，如此无穷无尽的想象力，给他们留下了深刻印象。

因为他们这样的性格特点，我在农场中以“医生”身份受大众欢迎，或者说是闻名遐迩。我第一次出发来非洲时，与一位出色的德国科学家同乘一船，这是他第二十三次来非洲，为了进行昏睡症(2)的医疗试验，随船还带了一百多只小白鼠和豚鼠。他告诉我，他与原住民打交道最大的困难，并非对方缺乏勇气——恰恰相反，事实上，面对疼痛或者大型手术，他们向来面无惧色——而是他们极其不喜欢常规无趣的事物：重复的疗程和规范化的操作都在此列。这位伟大的医生对此百思不得其解。而当我本人了解原住民之后，他们的这一特性竟成为我最喜爱的事物。他们拥有真正的勇气：对危险纯粹完全的接受与认同——当命运宣告，这是生命最真实的答复；当天堂发言，这是大地深处的回响。我有时想，在原住民内心深处，他们最害怕我们卖弄学问；在书呆子手里，他们会郁闷至死。

我的病人们都等在我屋外的一个石头铺砌的平台上，三三两两蹲着——骨瘦如柴的老人咳得撕心裂肺、泪眼汪汪；年轻清瘦的小伙子们动不动就打架斗殴，黑着眼圈，嘴巴上青一块紫一块；妈妈带着发烧的孩子，小宝宝们像打蔫的花朵一般，无力地垂头靠在妈妈的肩颈上。我经常治疗严重的烧伤，基库尤人晚上都围在棚屋中心的火堆入睡，燃烧着的木柴或者炭块有时会崩塌，滚落下来——有时当药物用尽，我发现，蜂蜜治烧伤的效果也不错。平台上气氛活泼愉快，还有三分刺激，像欧洲赌场里面似的。兴奋的窃窃私语声汇成低低的音浪，我一踏出门，声音戛然而止。但这安静里孕育着无限可能性，此时此刻，似乎任何事都可能发生。不过他们都默不作声，等我自己挑选第一个诊疗对象。

我对医学其实所知无几，仅限于一般人在急救课程上学到的那一点儿。但几次幸运眷顾，我偶然治好了一些患者，令我名声大振，四里八乡都知道我精于医术，即使我犯下了若干灾难性的医疗过错，也丝毫无损我的威名。

如果那时的我能保证我的病人们个个痊愈，谁知道求医的人群会不会缩小？我将被公认为专业卓著——活脱脱就是一位来自洛维亚(3)手到病除的名医——但原住民还会相信上帝与我同在吗？他们对于上帝的了解，来自大旱年境，来自晚上在草原上游荡的狮子，还有房子前后徘徊的花豹——孩子们正单独待在房子里，以及那密密麻麻的蝗群，不知从何处而来，所到之地，片叶不留。同样，他们了解上帝，也来自那些让人难以置信的快乐时刻：蝗灾只是过境，没有停留；春雨来得早，雨量丰沛，万象更新，每一块田的每一棵植株都花朵累累，果实充盈。因此，这位“赛华佗”，当原住民生命中那些真正息息相关的大事发生，到底不过是个局外人，只能旁观。




让我意外的是，我们初遇的第二天早上，卡曼特就出现在我房外。他站在与其他三四个病人略略有些距离的地方，腰挺得直直的，那半死的脸，仿佛在说：不管怎样，他对生命仍有点滴恋眷之情，现在他下定决心要抓住这最后一次机会，活下去。

日子一天天过去，他表现得像一位模范病人，约好的时候他一定准时来，从不出错。告诉他隔三四天来一次，他也总是严格遵约行事。对原住民来说，准时是很难得的。治疗脓疱较为疼痛，他以一种我不曾领略过的坚忍态度承受着。在各方面，我都可以把他当作其他病人的榜样，但我没有，因为与此同时他让我心里非常不安。

我极少极少遇到这样的原始生命：一个与世隔绝的人，以坚定的、宿命般的逆来顺受，将自己闭锁起来，完全摒弃周围的生活。我问他，他就答，但他从不主动开口，也从不抬头看我。对自己遭遇的一切，他全不自怜。其他孩子清伤口或者包扎时往往哭哭啼啼，他多半报以淡淡的轻蔑笑容，那笑里有轻视，也有“对于痛苦我比你们知道得更多”，他也向来不正眼看他们。对运命之手的触摸，他不抱任何指望，那双手已经触过他了，他太知道那残酷。面对痛苦，他灵魂中的坚毅，是古代勇士才有的。一件事无论有多糟糕，也不会让他吃惊：他的生命经历、他的处世哲学，令他时刻等待着那最糟糕的。

这一切汇成一种宏大的气度，令人想起普罗米修斯的信念宣言：“痛苦是我的一部分，正如仇恨是您的。现在把我撕成碎片吧——我不在乎。”以及“啊，您想怎么为难我都可以，您是万能的。”这样的气度生在一个体格如此瘦小的人身上，真让人难受，让人灰心沮丧。我暗自思忖：当上帝面对这么个小人儿的英雄气概，到底应该作何感想？

他第一次看我并主动开口说话的情景，我一直记得很清楚。那时我们认识已经有一段时间了，我刚刚弃用第一种疗法，改用一种新疗法，在书上看来的热敷法。我急于求成，把敷剂弄得太热，当我啪一下把它按在他腿上时，卡曼特开口了：“姆萨布(4)。”并深深看了我一眼。原住民用这个印地词汇来称呼白人女性，但发音略有不同，意思也不太一样，把它变成了一个非洲词。在卡曼特嘴里，这是乞求，也是警告，仿佛一个忠实的老友，在劝诫你别做傻事。从此时起，我看到了希望。我很有当医生的雄心壮志，也很抱歉敷剂烫痛了他。但我又很高兴，他看向我的第一眼，是这个原住民孩子与我之间默契的开始。这个受苦受难的孩子瞻望未来时，除了苦难还是苦难，但这一次，在我手中，他等待的不是苦痛。

治疗一直在进行，他的状况却始终不见好转。很长一段时间，我坚持给他的腿洗呀包呀，但病魔有威，我能力有限。一次又一次，伤口好像有一点点起色，随即脓疮又在新的地方爆发。到最后，我决定送他去苏格兰长老会传教团医院看病。

仅此一次，我的决定让他觉得生死攸关，藏了无数的可能性，卡曼特陡然有了压力——他不想去。他的过往、他的人生哲学，都使他从不反抗任何事，但当我驱车把他送入传教团，把他放在医院的长排建筑前，被完全陌生神秘的环境包围，他禁不住瑟瑟发抖。

苏格兰长老会传教团是我的近邻，在农场西北二十千米处，海拔比我们所在处高一百五十米。而法国天主教传教团在农场以东十六千米处，地势平坦，海拔比我们所在处低一百五十米。我与两家教会都没有共鸣，但私下里和双方的交情都不错，很为他们之间的战火硝烟觉得遗憾。

法国神父们都是我的至交。我经常在星期日早晨和法拉一道骑马过去做弥撒。部分是为了有机会重说法语，部分是因为去往传教团的骑乘之旅实在愉快。路很长，要穿过林业部原来的金合欢种植场，在清晨的空气里，它们散发着松脂般新鲜热烈的气味，闻之令人精神一振。

无论在什么地方，每当我目睹天主教堂那独特的景致，都禁不住心神震荡。神父们亲手设计了教堂，并在原住民教众的协助下，一砖一瓦地修建成功，他们对此十分自豪，而且自豪得有理有据。灰色的大教堂，在他们自家咖啡园的正中央，顶有钟楼，下有阳台和台阶，广阔的院落在四周铺开。这座咖啡园是本殖民地历史最悠久的一座，打理得井井有条。庭院两侧是带拱顶的餐厅和女修道院，还有学校和磨坊，都依河而建。要前往教堂，得先骑马穿过拱桥。教堂以灰色巨石垒成，从桥顶策马前行时，远远看去，画面简约整洁而气度非凡，仿佛是在瑞士南部或意大利北部。

当弥撒结束，和气的神父们在教堂门口排成一行等我，邀我穿过庭院，步入宽广阴凉的餐厅小酌一杯；跟他们交流，真是赏心乐事，关于殖民地上的大小事，他们都是百晓生，最偏远地方的八卦都无所不知。同时，在亲热轻松聊天的伪装下，他们也能挖出你嘴里的最新消息，就像一群毛茸茸的褐色小蜜蜂，为了花房里的蜂蜜，围悬在花朵上方周围——还真像，考虑到他们都留着厚厚的大胡子。不过，虽然对殖民地的日子颇为乐在其中，他们在海外的每一天还是沿用法式生活习惯。对神奇造物的安排，他们既温柔服从，也发自内心地敬奉。若不是这未知权威将他们留下，你知道他们不会出现在这里，不会有带着钟楼的灰色巨石教堂，也不会有拱廊、学校、漂亮咖啡园的一枝片叶，甚至整个传教团。只要一纸调令，他们每一个人都将把殖民地上的一切抛在脑后，以最快的速度奔回巴黎。

我在教堂和餐厅出出进进，法拉在门外牵着两匹小马。回农场的路上，他注意到我的逸兴昂扬——他本人是虔诚的穆斯林，滴酒不沾，但他把弥撒和饮酒认作我信仰中两项同样举足轻重的仪式。

法国神父们有时会骑着摩托车到农场上来，与我共进午餐，给我讲拉封丹(5)寓言，也对咖啡园的建设给出实实在在的建议。

我跟苏格兰长老会传教团就没这么熟了。从那里看向四周，满眼都是基库尤乡村景色，山清水秀，但传教团本身给我无知乡愿的感觉，仿佛他们没什么脑筋。苏格兰长老会费尽九牛二虎之力，要让原住民穿欧式服装，而这个，我觉得，从任何角度来说，都对他们毫无裨益。不过传教团有一家相当出色的医院，我在非洲时，医院由仁慈聪敏的精神科医生阿瑟博士主持，拯救了农场很多人的生命。

卡曼特在苏格兰长老会传教团医院待了三个月，其间我只见过他一次。那次是我骑马去基库尤火车站经过传教团，有一小段路紧贴着医院院子。我瞥见了卡曼特的身影，在院子里，他独个儿站着，跟其他一些三三两两的康复病人保持着距离。这时他已经好转了很多，都能跑能跳了。一看到我，他就奔向栅栏，在栅栏的那一侧紧跟着我小跑，直到路的尽头，就像围场上的一匹小马驹，当你骑马从它身边经过一样。他的眼神追随着我身下的小马，却不说一句话。栅栏拐弯处他不得不停下来，我一边打马前行，一边回头看去：他呆呆站着，一动也不动，高高抬着头，凝视着我的背影。样子与你离开它走远时的小马驹真是一模一样。我向他挥了几下手，起初他完全没反应，然后他的手臂突然笔直举得老高，就像抽水机上的把手一样，不过他的手只举了一下。




卡曼特在复活节(6)那天早晨回到大宅。他交给我一封院方的信，信里说明他恢复良好，可以算是永久痊愈。他一定多少知道些信里的内容，我读信时他专注地盯着我的脸，但他没有问，他脑海里有更重要的事要做。卡曼特通常都相当冷静，带着一种内敛的尊严，但这一次，满腔欢欣之情藏都藏不住，他整个人神采飞扬。

所有原住民都天生擅长制造戏剧化的效果。卡曼特事先把双腿用旧绷带细细绑起来，一直绑到膝盖上，就为了给我一个惊喜。很明显，这辉煌的时刻，他不是看到了自己的好运气，而是全心全意地将其当作他能带给我的巨大快乐。他或许还记得我在他身上大费周章，迎来一次又一次失败，曾有多少沮丧。他也知道这治疗效果好得足以令人赞叹。慢慢地，慢慢地，从膝盖到脚跟，他一寸寸解开腿上的绷带，肌肤一片片露了出来：双腿完全光滑，只留着几处浅浅的灰色疤痕。(7)

卡曼特不动声色，以他的庄重风范尽情享受我的目瞪口呆和喜笑颜开。随后，他又告诉我：他皈依基督了，“我现在与您一样”。他的话再次让我喜出望外。他补充道，他觉得我应该给他一卢比(8)，因为基督就是在今天升天的。

他暂时告辞，去看望族人。他母亲是一个寡妇，住得离农场很远。他向她打开心扉，把那些医院里接触到的陌生人与陌生事给他留下的印象，统统都说给她听。事后从她那里听说了这件事，我深信，他把那一天当作与旧日生涯一刀两断的分水岭。离开母亲的棚屋之后，他就来到大宅为我做事，仿佛理所当然，本来就属于这里。从那时起，他一直留在我身边，为我服务，直到我离开这片国土——历时十二年。

我第一次遇到卡曼特时，看他像只有6岁，但他还有一个兄弟模样是8岁左右，兄弟俩都说他才是老大，所以我猜漫长的疾病抑制了他的生长，很可能他当时是9岁。他现在长高了，却还是给人小矮子的印象，可能因为身体某些地方有畸形，虽然很难明确指出究竟是哪些地方。他七棱八角的小瘦脸渐渐长圆，走起路来也很轻快，我不觉得他难看，不过很可能，我用的是造物主看万物的眼光。他的腿还是细得跟棍儿似的。他一直都是一个梦幻般的形象，一半是小丑，另一半是恶灵，只需极轻微的修饰，他就可以成为巴黎圣母院尖顶上的雕像，冷冷地看穿下界。他内里有小火焰，正熊熊燃烧。如果世事如油画，他会成为画上不寻常的、浓墨重彩的一笔，因此在我家的那一角画面上，他是最栩栩如生的笔触。他脑子始终不算十分清楚，至少在大部分时间里，白人多半觉得他是“怪胎”。

他是个好想事儿的人。或许长年病痛深深发展了他独立思考的天性，眼见的每一件事，他都会思前想后，最后得出自己的结论。他活在自己的世界里，以自己的方式与世隔绝。即使他和别人做一样的事，也从来是用不一样的方式。

我为农场上的人们开设了夜校，请一位原住民校长教课。校长都是我从传教团找的教众，所以我在非洲期间有过三位校长——天主教的、英格兰圣公会的以及苏格兰长老会的。对于肯尼亚的原住民教育，宗教界相当保守。据我所知，除了《圣经》和赞美诗之外，没有任何一本书籍被翻译成斯瓦希里语。我曾打算翻译《伊索寓言》，觉得对原住民会有助益，但始终抽不出时间来完成我的宏图大业。不过即便如此，学校仍然是农场上我最爱的一处地方，是我们精神生活的中心。教室狭长，是用波纹钢皮搭成的旧谷仓改建的，在那里，我度过了许多美好的夜晚。

卡曼特总与我同去，却从不加入到课桌后的孩子们中间，他宁愿站得与他们远一点，仿佛刻意捂住耳朵拒绝听讲。来上课听讲的孩子们显得那么心甘情愿，他为他们的幼稚单纯嗤笑不已。但当他一个人待在厨房里的时刻，我看到他在默写，动作很慢，笔画颠三倒四，那些他在学校黑板上细细观察过的字和词一个一个落在纸上。即使他愿意与大家打成一片，我也不觉得他做得到。在他生命的早期，有些东西已经扭曲或者锁死，因此对他来说，正常的事物反而是不正常的。他清楚意识到自己的孤单。真正的小矮人，都有一种灵魂深处独有的自高自大，他发现自己与全世界格格不入，而他坚持认为：是世界的错。

卡曼特在钱的事情上是很精明的，他几乎不花钱，还同几个基库尤人合作买卖过很多次山羊，都赚到了钱。他早早就结了婚，而婚姻在基库尤世界里耗资极其巨大。在他结婚前后，我听他发表过哲学家般的高论：钱就是身外之物，毫无用处。他讲得头头是道，颇有自己的见地。他把自己与周围的事物用一种特殊的关系联结起来：他主宰这关系，也确实没觉得这关系有什么了不起。

他天生缺乏对人的敬佩之情。他能懂得动物的机灵，常常啧啧不已，但自我认识他以来只听过他开口赞扬一个人的通情达理，那是一位几年后来到农场的索马里少妇。他有一种微带嘲弄的笑容，随时随地都会浮现，特别是面对其他人的自负和豪言壮语时。所有原住民都抱着内在的幸灾乐祸态度，事情越是搞砸，他们越是喜形于色。这本身就是一种伤害，令欧洲人十分反感。而卡曼特把这种特征发展到罕有的完美境界，甚至成为一种特殊的自嘲，他能拿自己的不幸沮丧找乐子，就像对待其他人一样。

我曾在一些老年原住民妇女身上见到这样的特质。她们被许多磨难煎熬过，宿命已变成血脉的一部分，无论遇到什么，对命运的任何拨弄，她们都接受，都认同，视命运女神为自己的小姐妹，怎么胡意妄为都理所应当。有一段时间，我让用人们在星期日清早向老妇人们分发鼻烟——原住民称为“淡巴菰”——那时我自己还未起身。因此每星期日，我的房子周围，会来很多奇形怪状的客人，使得那里像一个养鸡场，聚满羽毛凌乱或者光秃秃的老母鸡；她们小声的嘀咕声——原住民很少大声喧哗——通过开着的窗户，灌进我的卧室。一个星期日早晨，情况却有所例外，基库尤人聊天的低语突然提高成为声浪，笑声四溅如瀑布，准有什么有趣的意外在门外发生了，我把法拉叫进屋想问个究竟。法拉不想说，后来才告诉我，是他忘了买鼻烟。于是那一天，老妇人们大老远过来，却如她们自己所说，空手而归——啥都没有。这场不幸的意外后来竟成为基库尤老妇人们的趣事笑柄之一。有时，我在玉米田的小路上遇到某位老妇人，她会直直地站在我面前，伸出一只皮包骨头、弯曲变形的手指指着我，苍老黧黑的脸上堆满笑容，所有的皱纹都被拉扯，彼此交叠，像有一根看不到的线操纵着。她是要提醒我，那一次她和老姐妹们为了鼻烟紧走慢走到大宅，却发现我忘了买，鼻烟末都不见一点儿——“哈哈，姆萨布！”

白人总说基库尤人不懂感恩。但卡曼特不是忘恩负义的人，他甚至亲口说他对我负有责任。从我们认识之后，多年来，只要看到我需要帮忙，他就会放下手里的活计过来为我效劳，虽然我根本没开过口。我问他为什么这样做，他说，如果不是我，他早就死了。他还有另一种方式来表达谢意，对我总是格外好心好意，特别乐于给我帮助，也许最合适的一个词是：百般包容。或许是因为他一直牢牢记得我俩同属基督教。在这个愚人世界，我想，对他来说，我是最愚不可及的那个。从他来为我做事、与我忧戚与共那一天起，那双警醒的、富有穿透力的双眼，就一直盯着我，对我所有一塌糊涂的处事方法，他心里都给出不偏不倚的清楚评价。我相信，在最开始，我宁愿招惹麻烦上身也要为他治病的行为就被他视为一种无可救药的怪癖。但他始终对我满怀同情，兴趣盎然，并竭尽所能引我走出蒙昧。有些时候，我发现他会用很长时间思考、做准备，只为了能把观点阐述得清清楚楚，我理解起来会比较容易。




卡曼特最开始在大宅负责喂狗，后来在我给人看病时帮手。帮手期间我发现他相当手巧，虽然单看他手的形状可看不出来。于是我送他去帮厨，给我的老厨师埃萨当学徒。埃萨被杀后，卡曼特接替了他的职位，到我离开非洲之前一直是我家的厨师。

原住民通常不把动物当宠物，但关于这个，就像在其他事情上一样，卡曼特再次与众不同。他是一个权威的养狗专家，与狗儿们简直心灵相通，经常跑来告诉我狗儿们盼着什么、望着什么、每时每刻的所思所想。他养的狗从不长虱子。不知道多少个午夜，我们被狗的咆哮声惊醒，我与他一起借着防风灯的光线，一只接一只摘掉狗儿们身上的食肉大蚂蚁——“萨福”。萨福们总是成群结队，走到哪里吃到哪里，所向无敌。

卡曼特在传教团医院住院的时候一定观察得细致入微——甚至对待治疗也一样，既不先入为主，也不敬而远之——因此他是个细致缜密、颇有创造性的医疗助手。他不在诊室帮忙后，也会经常在我看病期间蓦地从厨房现身，打断我的治疗，提出行之有效的建议。

但作为一个厨师，他又是另外一种人物，无法将他归入任何门类。造化在这里一步飞跃，忽略了优先秩序，直接给了“才能”和“天赋”，于是事情变得既神奇又不可理喻，就像天才身上常常发生的那样。在厨房，在烹饪的世界里，卡曼特拥有天才的一切禀赋，甚至包括天才的厄运——空拥才能却无力施展。如果卡曼特生在欧洲，由明师亲手培育，他多半会变得远近皆知，很可能在历史上留下怪才之名。不过，在偏远的非洲，他也是相当有名的，对厨艺的态度充满大师风范。

我自己对烹饪很有兴趣，我第一次回欧洲时就曾拜一位名餐厅的法国大厨为师，因为我觉得在非洲烧一手好饭好菜，是件叫人愉快的事。大厨佩德罗先生，被我对烹饪的热爱打动，特许我和他一起进入餐厅后厨参观学习。当我发现卡曼特熟悉的厨者精神后，那份挚爱又一次占据了我。在我看来，我与他的合作前景不可限量。我觉得没有什么能比原始人对我们的烹饪艺术的天赋更神秘难测的了。这启迪我用另一种眼光看待我们的文明：归根结底，文明很可能是天授的，是一种命中注定的事物。我觉得我就像迷失的人，只因为颅相学学者(9)向我指出神学雄辩术在人脑中的位置便重拾信仰：如果能证明神学雄辩术的存在，那么神学的存在当然也能借机得到证明，最终，就能证明上帝是存在的。

在处理所有的厨房事务时，卡曼特都惊人地敏捷熟练。每桩厨事绝招和最耗工耗力的活计，在他那双黧黑弯曲的手里都不值一提。举凡煎蛋饼、烙酥皮馅饼、调各种酱汁和做蛋黄酱，这双手生来就会，无师自通。他有一种特殊的才能，做什么都举重若轻，如同传奇故事：圣婴基督用黄泥巴捏小鸟，一挥手，小鸟就展翅高飞。他不屑于精密工具，仿佛对专物专用很不耐烦。我给他的打蛋器被束之高阁，蒙尘生锈，他用一把修草坪的剪草刀来打蛋白，而打出来的蛋白轻盈如云、高耸如塔。作为厨师，他眼光独到，极富洞察力，一眼就能认出全养鸡场最肥的那只母鸡，鸡蛋在手心慎重地掂几下，马上知晓是何时生出来的。为了改善我家的餐饮水平，他费了不少脑子，详详细细安排过。他居然用了一些法子，从朋友的偏远乡村的雇主那里为我弄到一些优质的莴苣种子。这些种子是我苦苦寻觅多年而徒劳无功的。

对于食谱，他记性极佳。他不会读书写字，也不懂英语，烹饪书对他毫无用处，但他把学到的一切都储藏在他那颗丑陋的大头里面，以一种自己独有的系统分类。这系统到底如何运作，我完全摸不着头脑。每当有事发生，他就会把当天菜肴以这件事命名，称某酱汁为“闪电劈树”，另一种是“灰马之死”。他从来没把两道菜搞混过。唯有一件事是我试图让他记住但屡告失败的，就是宴席中上菜的顺序。于是每当我请客，我必须给我的厨师画出一张餐单来：头盘是汤，次之是鱼，第三份是鹧鸪或朝鲜蓟……我不太相信他这一缺点真是由于他记性差，我觉得，在他内心，一定认为凡事不可求尽，这种细枝末节不必浪费时间。

与技艺出众者共事，真让人心里痛快。名义上厨房是我的，但合作期间，我感觉不仅是厨房，我们所共同完成的一切事务，其实都尽在卡曼特一手掌握中。他透彻了解我所有的期许，有时我还没说出口，他已经完美地把它们变成现实。他如此精益求精，我却始终不明白，他是怎么做到的，或者为什么能这样。对我来说，这简直匪夷所思，一个人能把一桩艺术完成到登峰造极的程度，却不懂得这项艺术的真谛，对它除了鄙夷之外，别无他感。

对一道菜应该是什么滋味，卡曼特一无所知。虽然他改换了信仰，与现代文明有了千丝万缕的联系，但在内心，他是一个彻头彻尾的基库尤人，对自己扎根其中的本民族文化传统无限忠诚，视之为一生中唯一值得的生存之道。做饭时，他有时候也品一下味，随即涌上满脸的难以置信，仿佛一个巫婆从她煮着肥皂水的大锅里啜了一口。他的最爱是祖辈代代相传的玉米饼，有时候，他还会脑子进水，给我奉上基库尤大餐——一块烤番薯或者一团羊油——就像驯养过的狗，虽然已与人类共同生活了很长时间，有时还会带一根骨头放在你脚前当作礼物。我觉得，在他心里，从头到尾都把那些我们为了美食而自找的麻烦视为绝顶愚蠢。有时我想引他说出心里话，不过虽然在很多事上他对我直言不讳，但在另外一些事上却选择守口如瓶。所以我们俩肩并肩在厨房里做事时，对烹饪的重要性各有见解，而求同存异。

我送卡曼特去穆海迦俱乐部学习，每当在朋友家里尝到新美味，也打发卡曼特到人家厨房里钻研。当他学徒期满，敝宅的餐桌在殖民地也算是内外知名了。这使我不胜欣喜。我渴望自己的艺术有人欣赏，和朋友们在一起吃饭也很开心。卡曼特对赞美都无动于衷，却记得每一位常来我家的朋友的口味。“我要为伯克利·科尔先生做白酒烩鱼，”他口气沉重地说，仿佛说的是一个精神错乱的人，“烹鱼的酒是他亲自送来的。”为了得到权威的意见，我请我的老朋友、住在内罗毕的查尔斯·布尔佩特先生来吃饭。布尔佩特先生早年间是一位伟大的旅行家，与菲利亚·福格(10)相差一代；他周游过世界，尝尽各地美味佳肴，只要还能今朝有酒今朝醉，他从不考虑未来。五十年前的体育与登山书籍详述过他作为运动员的丰功伟绩，也记录了他在瑞士和墨西哥登山的情况。有一本记载著名打赌事件的书叫《来得容易去得快》，在里面你可以读到，他如何为了打赌，穿着晚礼服，戴着高帽，游泳横渡泰晤士河——而且不久后，他还有更罗曼蒂克的壮举，那就是在赫勒斯滂(11)里畅游，就像勒安得耳(12)及拜伦勋爵(13)一样。他能来农场与我共进晚餐，我特别高兴。有机会为你十分欣赏的人献上亲手烹制的美味，是一种特殊的福分，令人喜不自胜。作为回报，他对每样食物都略加点评，又对天下大事高谈阔论了一番。他还告诉我：在世界的任何角落，他都不曾吃过更愉快的一餐。

威尔士亲王(14)曾赏光赴农场做客，在席间对坎特伯雷调味汁给予高度嘉许。这是唯一一次，我向卡曼特转述客人对厨艺的溢美之词时，他表现出很大兴趣，听得全神贯注。对原住民来说，国王是很了不起的，他们也很喜欢谈起国王。几个月后，他还想再听一次，就突然问我，用的句子像法文初级阅读课本里面的：“苏丹王子(15)喜欢那种猪调味汁吗？他全吃光了吗？”

在厨房之外，卡曼特也处处向我展现美意，根据他自己对当下祸福的判断，随时准备施我以援手。

一天晚上已是午夜过后，他突然默默地走进我的卧室，手里提着一盏防风灯，仿佛是在巡夜值勤。当时他一定才来大宅不久，印象中年纪还很小。他站在我床边，一双硕大的招风耳像一只迷路的黑蝙蝠，误打误撞进了卧室。他手里拎着的灯又使他像一簇磷火。他非常郑重地说：“姆萨布，我认为你最好起床。”我从床上坐起来，被弄糊涂了，心想如果真有什么大事发生，该是法拉来通知我。我第二次开口叫他离开，他还是不肯动。“姆萨布，”他又说了一遍，“我认为你最好起床。我想上帝他老人家来了。”当我听到这话，起了床，并且问他为何这样说。他一脸严肃地带我走进朝西临山的餐厅。透过落地窗，我看到一幅奇异的画面：一场燎原大火正在熊熊燃烧，从山顶一直烧到平原上，所有的野草都烧着了。从大宅看去，大火几乎是一条竖线，是一头正在行走的巨大生灵，向我们迎面而来。我伫立不动，凝视良久，卡曼特在我身侧一起观看。我猜他被吓坏了，想安抚他，便开始向他解释。但我的话，他显然不以为意。将我唤醒，已经完成了他充盈心间的使命。“好吧，”他说，“可能吧。但我想你还是起床比较好，万一真是上帝来了呢？”

原住民在我家


有一年，雨季没有来。

对于曾经经历旱灾的农人来说，这是悲惨至极的遭遇，永远不会忘记。几年后，当他离开非洲，在北方国家湿润的气候里，半夜，他听见急雨入夜的声音会一跃而起，喊着：“终于来了，终于来了。”

通常年景，雨季在三月最后一星期开始，延续到六月中旬。雨季降临之前，世界一天比一天热，一天比一天干，持久高温，像欧洲暴雨之前的气候，甚至更加酷热。

与我隔河而居的马赛人这时放火烧荒，烧掉表皮已经干枯坚韧的植物。这样，新雨来临时，土地上将长满新生的绿草，可以放牛羊。平原上，空气因火焰而摇曳着；长长的、闪着虹彩色泽的浓烟弥漫开来，燃烧的味道和热度浮在耕田上方，就像从火炉里发散出来的一样。

极目远眺，枯草组成的苍茫大地上方，巨大的云朵聚在一起，复又消逝；远方有淡淡的雨雾，为地平线画出一条蓝色的斜线。整个世界只有这一个意念。

黄昏之后，日落之前，风景从各个方向拥过来，紧贴着你，山峦也靠近你，或绿或蓝都历历如绘，显得生机盎然、意味深永。几小时后，你走出门，看到星子已经隐退，你感觉到夜晚的空气轻柔深邃，仿佛孕育着无限恩宠。

急促的刷刷声由弱渐强，从你头顶上掠过，那是高高森林间的风——不是雨；在地面上奔腾而去，那是席卷过灌木丛和长长蔓草的风——不是雨；在地表略高处沙沙作响，哗哗啦啦，那是穿行在玉米田的风——听起来实在像雨，你不由得一次次心生错觉，甚至从幻象里获得了真实的快乐，仿佛归根到底，你久久渴盼的演出在舞台上出演了——仍然不是雨。

等到大地如一个共鸣板，发出深沉浑厚的回响，世界在你周围高歌，所有维度，上穷碧落下黄泉，都在引吭不已——那才是雨。大雨急不可待要重返海洋，正如你想重回分隔多日的爱人的怀抱。

但有一年雨季没有来。好像全宇宙都从你身边掉头远离。天气一天天变凉，有些日子甚至很冷，但空气中没有丝毫湿润的迹象。万物都越来越干，越来越硬，似乎所有的力量与优美都从世上抽身而去。不再存在好天气与坏天气，只有对所有天气的否定，雨季无限延期，直到天干地裂都不会来。一阵阴冷的风掠过你头顶，万物的百般鲜妍都褪色。田野的气息、森林的清氛，全荡然无存。被诸神抛弃的感觉压迫着你。在南边，火烧过的草原黑压压地躺着，上面交错着灰色和白色的草木灰。

每日每夜，我们都徒然地等着雨的消息，农场的前景和希望日益黯淡，终成泡影。几个月来的耕作、修枝和栽种，都被证明是愚昧人的劳碌。农场事务一步步慢下来，终至完全停摆。

在山间和平原上，泉眼正在干涸，各种各样的鸭和鹅来到我家池塘；农场边缘的池塘上，则有很多斑马来喝水，趁着清晨或日落时分，排着长长的队，足有两三百头，幼崽走在母亲身边。我骑马从队伍中穿行，它们并不怕我。为了给自己的牲畜留口水喝，我们尽量把它们赶走，因为池塘里的水位正在下降。尽管如此，到池塘旁仍然是件愉快的事，泥沼里长出的灯芯草丛像灰褐大地上一方鲜绿的补丁。

旱灾里，原住民们变得很沉默：未来将如何，我从他们嘴里探听不到一个字。虽然你原本会觉得，关于天气的种种信号，他们总比我们知道得多。他们的生死存亡正危如累卵。在大旱年时失去八九成的牲畜，这样的事，他们和他们的父辈都曾有耳闻。他们的自留地干裂了，只剩极少的番薯和玉米，也都已枯萎，无力地低垂着头。

过了一段时间之后，我渐渐体悟到他们的人生态度，也不再讨论或抱怨艰难时世，像蒙羞的人对羞耻绝口不提。但我是一个欧洲人，我还没在这块土地上生活得够久，能做到原住民这种绝对的无为之治。有些欧洲人可以，他们在非洲已经住了好几十年。我年轻，有自我保护的本能，必须把精力凝注在某件事上，既然我不想让生命随农场道路上的沙尘或平原上的一缕轻烟而逝。我开始在晚上写故事、童话及浪漫小说，任我的思绪飘向远方，去到其他的时空。

我曾经向一个来农场小住的朋友讲过其中一些故事。

当我站起身走出门，狂风大作，夜空清澄如洗，上百万颗星星闪着寒光，一切都是干枯的。

起初我只在晚上写作，但是后来我经常早上也坐下来写，那本是我应该去农场干活的时段。在田间地头我得考虑：要不要再翻一遍玉米田，再撒一次种子；是摘掉干枯的咖啡果以保住咖啡树，还是不摘？做决定很难。一天拖一天，我始终下不了决心。

我通常在餐厅写作，餐桌上满是纸张，因为在写作间隙，我还得算账，为农场的将来打算，要答复农场经理令人沮丧的便条。用人问我在干什么；当我告诉他们我在写书的时候，他们以为这是我在艰难的日子里为拯救农场所做的最后一搏，对此很感兴趣。后来他们会问我书进展得如何，也会走进来，长久地站在房里看我写书。房里镶着护墙板，他们的头脸与墙板一色。在晚上看去，他们好像只是一件件白长袍，背对着墙，陪伴着我。




我的餐厅朝西，三扇长窗对着平台、草地和森林。餐厅外便是通向河边的斜坡，这条河是我与马赛人之间的边界。从房子里看不到河流本身，但视线可以沿着河流两侧高大深绿的金合欢树，描画出河的曲折走向。河的对岸，地势渐高，树木掩映，再越过树林，是一大片青翠的草原，一直延伸到恩贡山脚下。

“而若我的信仰之强足以撼动山岳，那么我将使它相就的正是此山。”

风从东方来：我餐厅的门恰在背风处，常年开着。因此，原住民们特别喜欢房子的西侧，时常从那里绕行，可以随时了解屋子里发生了什么事。出于同一动机，原住民放牛娃们也经常把羊群赶到这周围，在草坪上放羊。

这些孩子，总是赶着家里的山羊和绵羊，在农场上晃荡，给羊群们找草吃，在我现代文明的房子和原始人的生活之间，他们架设了一道桥梁。仆人不信任他们，不喜欢他们到屋里来，但孩子们对现代文明真心喜爱，满怀热忱；毕竟文明对他们来说有益无害，而他们只要愿意，随时可以拔腿就跑。对他们来说，文明的典型象征是一座挂在餐厅墙上的德国制旧咕咕钟(1)。钟在非洲高原上是彻头彻尾的奢侈品。一年到头，你总可以通过太阳方位判断是几点；而且你不用赶火车，农场事务你可以随心安排，时间因此变得无足轻重。不过这的确是一座很精致的钟。每当整点时刻，在粉色玫瑰花的簇拥下，一扇小门啪地打开，一只布谷鸟向前弹出，以清脆高傲的声音报时。每一次，这如有神力的一幕，都带给农场孩子们全新的喜悦。从太阳的方位，他们能够精确判断日中报时即将到来，十二点差一刻了，我能看见他们从四面八方靠近我的房子，紧跟在羊群后面，寸步不敢离开。孩子们的头、山羊的头，透过灌木丛和长长的野草，高高低低地挤在一起，就像池塘里露出一颗颗青蛙的小脑袋一样。

把各自的牲口留在草坪上，他们光着脚无声无息地走进屋。大孩子约有10岁，最小的才2岁。他们表现得很乖，遵守着一种自己规定的做客礼节：可以在屋里自由走动，但不碰任何物件，不坐下来，有人跟他们说话才说话。当布谷鸟对着他们跳出来，孩子们一阵狂喜，爆发出抑制住的笑声。有时还会发生这样的事：年纪特别小的孩子，还没轮到负责放羊，会在大清早一个人跑来，长久地站在钟跟前，先紧紧闭着嘴一声不吭，再用基库尤语低声吟唱，倾诉心头的爱慕，最后庄重地离开。用人们笑话这些孩子，向我吐露说：孩子们太傻了，以为布谷鸟是活的。

用人们常进来看我用打字机工作。晚上，有时卡曼特倚站在墙边，一站就是一小时，双眼来回闪烁像眉毛下的两滴黑色水珠，仿佛他打算学会这部机器的一切，好把它拆开，再重新装配在一起。

一晚，我抬起头来，正撞见他兴味浓厚且好奇专注的眼神，过了一会儿，他开口了。“姆萨布，”他说，“你自己相信你能写一本书吗？”

我答说：我不知道。

必须指出，任何人要与卡曼特对话，都得预先假设在每一个短语之前，会迎来一个漫长的、含蓄的、仿佛意蕴千钧的停顿。所有原住民都是停顿艺术的大师，借此让谈话有了深度。

卡曼特如我刚刚所说，停顿了很久很久，然后说：“我不相信。”

再没有其他人可以与我讨论这本书；我放下手中的纸页，问他为什么。我发现，关于这场对话，他一定事先思考过，做了准备；他站着，一手在身后拿着《奥德赛》(2)，这时把书放到桌上。

“看，姆萨布，”他说，“这是本好书。它每一张纸的尾巴都被钉在一起。就算你把它举起来用力摇，也不会散得一张一张的。写这本书的人很聪明。但是你写的，”他继续说下去，带着轻蔑，也怀着友善的恻隐之情，“这里一些那里一些。要有人忘了关门，就会被吹得到处都是，甚至掉到地板上，你会很生气。这不会是一本好书。”

我向他说明：在欧洲，人们能把它们装订在一起。

“那么，你的书会像这本一样重吗？”卡曼特问，掂量着《奥德赛》的分量。

看到我犹豫了一下，他立刻把书递给我，让我自己判断。

“不，”我说，“不会这么重。不过你要知道，图书馆还有很多比它轻的书。”

“也一样硬？”他又问。

我说，把书弄这么硬是很贵的。

他默默地伫立少顷，随即用行动表达了对我的书最深的期许，也可能是因自己的怀疑而觉得不好意思：他从地上一张一张捡起散落的纸页，把它们叠放到桌上。他仍然没有走开，站在桌边等了等，严肃地问我：“姆萨布，书里有什么？”

为了举个例子，我告诉他《奥德赛》里面大英雄与独眼巨人波吕斐摩斯的故事：奥德修斯如何自称“没有人”，如何挖出了波吕裴摩斯的独眼，如何逃出被绑在公羊腹下的厄运。

卡曼特听得津津有味，并发表自己的见解：那头公羊一定与住在埃尔门泰塔(3)的朗先生家的绵羊是一个品种，他在内罗毕牲畜展上见过。他又说回到独眼巨人，问我巨人是不是黑人，就像基库尤人一样，当我说“不是”的时候，他又想知道奥德修斯是否与我同宗或同族。

“那他怎么，”他问，“用自己的语言，说这个词，Noman(4)？说一下。”

“他说Outis，”我告诉他，“他叫自己‘乌提斯’，在他的语言里就是‘Noman’的意思。”

“你也得写一样的东西吗？”他问我。

“不，”我说，“谁爱写什么就写什么。我可能会写你。”

就像突然挑起话题一样，卡曼特突然终止了对话。他低头看看自己，低声问我我将写哪一部分的他。

“我可能会写你生病时和在野外放羊时的事，”我说，“你当时心里在想什么？”

他的眼光在房间里游移不定，上上下下，最后他含糊地说：“瑟久（我不知道）。”

“你那时害怕吗？”我问他。

他停了停。“是的，”他肯定地说，“每个孩子在荒野上有时候都会害怕。”

“你怕什么呢？”我说。

卡曼特站着，静默片刻，然后他看向我，表情变得专注深沉，眼神直透入里。

“害怕乌提斯，”他说，“草原上的孩子怕乌提斯。”

几天后，我听见卡曼特向其他用人说，我写的书会在欧洲被订在一起，订得牢牢的，能做得像《奥德赛》一样硬，不过得花一个吓人的大价钱，说话间，那本书又被拿出来展示。不过他本人应该不相信这本书真能问世。




卡曼特有一种独门绝技，在我家对他特别有用。他能够——我觉得是——想哭就立刻哭出来。

如果我动了真气，斥责他，他直直地站在我面前，一边察言观色，一边显出悲痛欲绝的神色，这种表情原住民是随时都做得出来的；随即他便满眼含泪，泪不可抑。沉重的泪滴，一颗接一颗从眼眶里涌出来，缓缓地滑下面颊。我知道这纯粹是鳄鱼眼泪，换了别人我不会假以辞色。但是放在卡曼特身上，我做不到。这种情况下，他扁平的、木刻般呆板的脸孔仿佛又沉进那漆黑而孤绝的世界，他曾经身陷其中很多年。当他还是个小男孩时，在草原上，四周只有羊，他也曾落下过这般沉重无声的泪吧。这眼泪让我心里很难受，不由得换个角度看看那些我正在责备他的错，发现没什么大不了的，也就不想再说什么了。某种程度上，他的眼泪让我泄气。但我始终坚信，在我与他之间，存在着真正的、人与人的互相理解。在卡曼特内心深处，他非常明白，我看穿了他痛悔的泪，没真当一回事儿——事实上，倒是他自己，与其说企图拿眼泪来蒙事儿，倒不如说是把这当作一种在更高权威下应有的驯服姿态。

他经常自称基督徒。我不知道他到底认为这三个字意味着什么。有一两次我试图盘问他，但他答道，我信什么，他就信什么，既然我肯定知道自己信什么，问他就没意义了。我发觉这并非遁词，而是他的进取之道，对信仰的自供状。他把自己交给了白人们的上帝。他为我做事，随时准备完成任何指令，却不打算操心这套规矩背后的原因，哪怕这规矩将被证明不合理，就像白人们自己的工作制度一样。

偶尔，我的行为与苏格兰长老团的教诲起了冲突。毕竟他是在那里皈依的，他就会问我到底哪边是对的。

原住民其实不怎么有偏见，这很令人诧异，因为你满心以为会在这些蒙昧未开的人身上找到黑暗的禁忌。我觉得，这归功于他们与各民族各部落都很熟悉。而且，在东非，人际交往是很活跃的，早先是买卖奴隶和象牙的老式商人；在我们的时代，则是移民和专猎大型动物的猎手们。几乎每个原住民，甚至草原上的小小放牛娃们，日常生活中，都要与各方面都大相径庭的多个民族面对面打交道。英国人、犹太人、布尔人(5)、阿拉伯人、索马里人、印度人、斯瓦希里人、马赛人和卡维朗多人(6)，所有民族对他们来说，都像西西里人对爱斯基摩人一样。只要不断接受新鲜事物，原住民比乡巴佬、外地人以及传教士们更像世界公民，那些人在整齐划一的小社会长大，倒往往有一套僵硬的观念体系。白人与原住民之间的误解多源于此。

要以身作则，向原住民示范基督教的精神，是非常吃力也让人惶恐的经历。

有一个年轻的基库尤人，名叫基他乌，来自基库尤人居留区，在我家做事。他是个喜欢沉思冥想的少年，也是一个事事上心、眼里有活的佣仆，我很喜欢他。三个月后的一天，他请我为他写一封推荐信给我的老友希克·阿里·宾·萨利姆，那是一位在蒙巴萨负责海岸事务的长官。基他乌在我家里见过他，现在打算去为他干活。基他乌才刚刚熟悉大宅的日常事务，我不想他离开，便表示我会给他涨工资。可他说他走不是为了赚更多钱，而是他不能留下来。他告诉我，还在居留区的时候，他就立志，将来要么做一个基督徒要么做一个穆斯林，不过他还不知道做哪个。于是他来为我工作，因为我是一个基督徒。他在我家待了三个月，观察了基督徒的“特斯特德”——风俗习惯；离开我之后，他将在蒙巴萨的希克·阿里家待三个月，学习穆斯林的“特斯特德”；然后他就可以做决定了。我相信，即使是一位大主教，这样的事摊到了他身上，也得说和我一样的话，或者至少这么想：“我的上帝呀，基他乌，你刚来时就应该告诉我。”

穆斯林不吃任何动物，除非它的喉咙是被穆斯林以正统礼俗割开的。在狩猎远征中，这是个难题，因为随身携带的供给是很有限的，仆人们的伙食要靠你射中的猎物。当你一枪击中牛羚，它轰然倒地，穆斯林仆人们飞也似的扑上去，为了在它咽气前割开它的喉咙。你提心吊胆地看着他们，眼里都快冒出火来，一旦他们只是站在那里，低着头，耷拉着胳膊，就意味着他们过去之前，它就死了。你必须再去跟踪一只牛羚，否则为你扛抢的人就得挨饿了。

一战初期，我正准备带牛车队出门，出发前夜，我在基加贝(7)偶然遇到一位穆斯林圣裔；我问他能否法外施恩，在我远征狩猎期间，给我的仆人们豁免权。

圣裔是个年轻人，却很开明，他同法拉和伊斯梅尔谈了谈，宣布：“这位女士是耶稣基督的信徒。开枪时，她会祝祷，或者至少在心里祝祷说：‘以上帝之名。’这使她的子弹与正统穆斯林的刀子效力相同。在这次远征期间，你们可以吃她射杀的动物的肉。”




基督教在非洲的威望被教派之间的互不相容削弱了。

在非洲的每个圣诞夜，我多半骑马去法国天主教传教团听午夜弥撒。一年中的这个时候，天气往往很热；当你骑马经过金合欢树林，能远远听见传教团悠扬的钟声，空气清澈温暖。你到教堂时，那里已经挤满了欢天喜地、兴致勃勃的人群，内罗毕的法国和意大利商人们都拖家带口出动；修道院学校的修女们也在场；原住民教众穿着节日盛装蜂拥在一起。华丽的大教堂里此刻灯火通明，数百支蜡烛同时点燃，教堂玻璃上都是神父亲手制作的大型彩绘。

卡曼特来大宅后的第一个圣诞节，我告诉他既然同为信徒，我将带他一起去做弥撒，还把那些即将目睹的美好景象以及神父们的风采描述了一遍。卡曼特全听进去了，很受打动，于是穿上了他最好的衣服。但当车开到门口，他却满脸焦虑地折返，说恐怕不能和我同去了。他不肯说原因，在我的追问前躲躲闪闪，到最后才和盘托出。不，他不能去，他到现在才反应过来，我打算带他去的是法国天主教传教团，他在医院的时候，被严厉告诫过一定要抵制它。我跟他说，这全是误会，他必须马上跟我走。闻听此言，他当即在我眼皮底下石化了，他死了，他直翻白眼，以至于只能看到眼白，他满头大汗。

“不，不，姆萨布，”他喃喃地说，“我不和你去。我知道得很清楚，那个大教堂里面，有一位姆萨布是‘姆巴亚萨纳’（坏透了）。”

听到这个，我难过极了，想现在真的应该带上他，只为让圣母马利亚本人给他以教化。教堂里，神父们用纸板制作了一座与真人差不多大小的圣母像，圣母一袭白衣，外披蓝袍。一般来说，原住民难以领略平面图的寓意，却会被雕像打动。所以我向卡曼特保证我会保护他，领他出了门。他紧随我走进教堂，刹那间，所有的顾虑都荡然无存。恰好那是法国传教团举办过最盛大的一次圣诞弥撒，教堂里布置了耶稣降生的图景——一个刚刚从巴黎运来的人工洞穴，里面被笼罩在碧蓝夜空的星光下，周围是一百只玩具动物：木制的牛、雪白的棉毛羊羔，全都精工细制，体积虽小，细节却做得一丝不苟。这一切一定在基库尤人心中掀起了狂澜。




自皈依基督后，卡曼特再也不怕接触死人了。

那之前他是害怕尸体的。每当有人被担架抬到屋外平台上，死在那里时，他绝不会帮忙把死者抬回去，但也不会像其他人那样闪得远远的，躲到草坪上。他只是站在路边一动不动，俨然一座小小的黑色纪念碑。为什么基库尤人根本不怕死亡却害怕接触尸体，白人怕死怕得要命，处理死者却浑若等闲？我不知道。你又一次意识到，他们的现实观与我们的是天差地别。不过所有农场主都明白：在这里你无法驾驭土著人，而只要你放弃改变他们的念头，就能为自己省去不少麻烦，因为原住民在这方面是宁死不屈的。

而现在卡曼特心中的恐惧已经烟消云散；亲戚们的胆小也被他嘲笑。他甚至还有一丝炫耀，好像要彰显他的上帝的力量。有时因缘际会，也让我得以考验他的信仰。在农场生活中，卡曼特与我一起抬过三次死人。一次是个年轻的基库尤女子，在我屋外被牛车意外辗倒；第二次是个基库尤小伙子，在森林里砍树时被砸死；第三次是位白人老者，在农场里居住过，在我的农事生涯里有过一席之地，最后死在了农场。

他是我的同胞，丹麦人，名叫努森，已经年老失明。有一天我在内罗毕，他摸索到我车边，做了自我介绍后，请求我在农场里给他找个住处，因为在世上他已别无容身之地。当时我正好缩减了种植园的白人雇员，有一间空置的小平房可以借给他。他便出了城，在农场住了六个月。

在高原农场上，他是一个独一无二的形象：他通身都像是大海中的生灵，仿佛我们身边的被剪断了翅膀的信天翁。生活的重负、疾病和酗酒彻底地毁了他，他躬腰驼背，身体歪斜。他满头红发都白了，混合成一种奇怪的色调，仿佛顶着一头草木灰，也好像有海盐渍过它，为他打上了海之标志，而大海，已是他的内在元素。但是，在他身上有不能熄灭的火焰，是任何灰烬也掩埋不了的。他出身丹麦渔民世家，当过水手，后来成为非洲最早几批拓荒者之一——是什么风把他吹到了这里？

老努森一生尝试过不少行业，尤其偏爱与水、鱼或者鸟有关的工作，但没有哪一行他做好过。他告诉我，有一度，他在维多利亚湖拥有一家渔业公司，有绵延数十千米的世上最好的渔网，还有一艘摩托艇。但在一战期间，他彻底失去了它。当他历数他的悲剧人生时，总会出现一个黑暗时刻：一次致命的误会或者一位朋友的背弃。我不知道究竟是哪种情况，因为他给我讲过好几次，每一次故事都不尽相同，而每一次，当他喃喃自语到这人生节点，都会黯然神伤至极。不过有一点可以肯定，这故事确有真实的成分：因为他住在我那儿的时候，为了弥补他的损失，政府向他支付每天一先令的赔偿金。

所有这些都是他来我这里做客时说的。他在自己的小屋里待着不舒心，因此常来大宅散心。我派去侍候他的原住民小孩，一次又一次从他身边跑开，因为他喜欢吓唬他们，虽然眼睛看不见，还会借助手杖摸索着，一头冲过去，扑向他们。他精神好的时候，会坐在大宅走廊上，喝过一杯咖啡后，开始为我吟唱丹麦民歌，兴致始终很高。能说说丹麦语，对他对我都不失为快事一桩，我们信口说着农场的琐事，彼此交换意见，其实只是在享受聊天的乐趣。但我通常对他不太有耐心，因为他一旦一屁股坐下来，就很难让他闭嘴起身离开。可想而知，在日常生活里，他更像《古舟子咏》(8)中的老水手，或者像《一千零一夜》中的海洋老人一样难缠。

在制作渔网方面，他可是能工巧匠——他跟我说，他做的都是天下最好的渔网——而在农场上，他在小屋里制作河马皮鞭——原住民使用的鞭子，材质是河马皮。他会从原住民或奈瓦沙(9)湖畔的农民手中买河马皮，如果运气好，一张皮能制五十根鞭子。我还保存了一根他送我的，真是一根好马鞭。制鞭工作令他的住处周边散发着恶臭，像老秃鹰的巢穴附近一样臭不可闻。后来我在农场挖了个池塘，几乎总看见他站在池边沉思苦想，水面映着他的倒影，像一只动物园里的水鸟。

老努森外形老衰，胸腔塌陷，却有一颗孩子般的心：天真、热烈、易怒、狂野，燃烧着好斗的纯粹火焰；他是一个罗曼蒂克的暴匪和战士。他任何时刻对任何人都满怀恨意，简直绝无仅有，几乎每个他接触过的人、打过交道的机构都会得罪他，令他暴跳如雷，大发脾气；他吁喊上苍降下火与硫黄雨到他们身上，用米开朗基罗式的方法，丹麦说法就是，“把这些恶魔画在墙上”。每当能让其他人打成一团，他总是乐不可支，就像小男孩撺掇两只狗打架或者让狗追咬小猫一样。在老努森的灵魂里，仍然保有令人刮目相看、肃然起敬的事物——历经漫长艰难的一生，到最后，就这么说吧，他被冲进一个平静的港湾，原本可以就势躺倒，任风帆落下——他却仍然以一颗少年心大声疾呼，与厄运及逆境对抗。我敬仰他，为这熊皮武士(10)的灵魂。

他从不提起自己，除非是用第三人称称为“老努森”。只要说起，必然是极端的自高自大和自吹自擂，永无例外。天下没有一桩事老努森不能完成且大获成功，没有一位拳击冠军老努森不能轻松取胜，饱以老拳。无论什么情况，凡提及其他人，他都是绝望的悲观主义者，预见到他们的悲惨下场，而且近在眼前，统统都是活该，是他们所作所为的报应。但一说到自己，又成了乐天的乐观主义者。在去世前不久，以我承诺保密为前提，他向我吐露一个惊人的宏伟计划，终会使老努森富甲天下，让他所有的敌人都无地自容。他告诉我，在奈瓦沙湖底积有上十万吨鸟粪，是开天辟地以来无数水鸟遗下的。他将把这些鸟粪全取出来。为了这最后的奋力一搏，他还专程到奈瓦沙湖考察了一次，研究制订计划的细节。发财梦正照耀着他，他却死了。这宏图大愿包括了他内心亲近的所有元素：深水、鸟群、不为人知的宝藏，甚至因为不应该和女人说，更有了“男人的事儿”的味道。在这远景的顶端，他用内心的眼睛看到了，大获全胜的老努森手持海神的三叉戟，正在驾风驭浪。他有没有向我解释过如何从湖底把鸟粪打捞出来，我不记得了。

老努森的所有伟大历险和成就事事处处都登峰造极，那些他向我娓娓道来的事都与老弱病衰、力不从心的讲述者本人截然不同。到最后你感觉到，你在同时应付彼此独立、本质迥异的两个人。老努森的高大形象从背景上冉冉升起，战无不胜，头戴胜利者的桂冠，是所有冒险故事中的英雄人物；而我认识的，是他驼背憔悴的老仆，永不疲于向我提起他。这人弱小卑微，毕生使命就是向世人传扬夸耀老努森之名，至死为休。只有他亲眼见过老努森，除他之外，只有上帝曾一睹老努森真身，而既然见过老努森，他就绝容不得有人对老努森略有微词。

只有一次我听到他用第一人称自称，是他去世前一两个月的事，他有严重心脏病，也正是心脏病夺去了他的生命。在农场上有一个星期没见到他，我到他的小屋去探个究竟。他睡在床上，就在河马皮散发的臭气中间，家徒四壁，到处乱糟糟的。他面如死灰，眼眶深陷，目光黯淡。我开口跟他说话，他既不回答我也不说话。很久之后，我站起来准备离开，他突然以嘶哑的声音微弱地说：“我很难受。”他说的不是老努森，老努森是不会生病也不会被打败的；是老仆，任由自己流露出只属于他本人的苦痛与悲惨。仅此一次。

老努森在农场总是无所事事，所以不时会锁上房间的门，不告而别，消失在我们的视野里。我猜，多半是他听说一位老朋友，那些光辉岁月里的同伴，抵达内罗毕的消息。他会在外面待十天半个月，直到我们已经快忘记他的存在，回来时总是病得奄奄一息、精疲力竭，几乎拖不动自己的脚步，也打不开门锁。之后，他会独个儿待上几天。这种情况下他会回避我，因为他觉得我肯定会对他的不辞而别失望，而且会因为他现在的病弱，居高临下对他。老努森，虽然有时会吟诵“水手的新娘她热爱风浪”，骨子里对女人是不信任的，视她们为男人公敌，会本能地、秉持着清规戒律，阻止他找乐子。




在他去世那天之前，他就是这样销声匿迹了两星期，农场上没人意识到他已经回来了。那一次，他一定是打算破例一把到大宅找我，因为他是倒在从他小屋到我房子的途中，在一条穿过咖啡园的小径上咽气的。我与卡曼特在小径上发现了他。那时快傍晚了，我们正出发去草原采蘑菇。正值四月，雨季的开始，蘑菇藏在新生的矮矮草丛里。

更符合事实真相的说法是，卡曼特发现了老努森的遗体。整个农场唯有他同情老努森，甚至对老努森很有兴趣，就像一个离经叛道者对另一个离经叛道者一样。隔三岔五卡曼特会主动给他鸡蛋，还监督他的小仆们，不许他们一起偷偷跑掉。

老人仰面躺着。他倒地时，帽子掉了，滚得稍微有点儿远，他的眼睛还没完全闭上。死后的他，看上去朴质宁静。终点站到了，老努森——我想。

我想把他的遗体带回他的小屋，但我知道招呼路经此地或者在附近自留地干活的基库尤人都是不现实的。他们一发现我叫他们来干什么，就会立刻飞奔而逃。我吩咐卡曼特跑回房子，把法拉带来帮我，但卡曼特没动。

“为什么你让我跑开？”他问。

“嗯，你自己看啦，”我说，“我一个人扛不动老努森，而你们基库尤人都是傻子，害怕扛死人。”

卡曼特无声地淡淡一笑，带着他特有的嘲讽。“你又忘了，姆萨布，”他说，“我是一个基督徒。”

他扛着老人的脚，我托着头把老人抬了回去。一路上，我们不时停下来，把老人搁在地上，自己休息一下；每到那时，卡曼特就会肃立在老人脚边，目光笔直下视。我想，这应该是苏格兰长老会传教团面对亡者的态度。

我们把老人放回床上，卡曼特在屋子里转来转去，还进了厨房，想找一块毛巾盖在老人脸上——结果只找到一张旧报纸。“医院里基督徒们就这么做。”他向我说道。

很久之后，只要卡曼特想起我在这件事上冒的傻气，就由衷高兴。往往是他在厨房和我一起做事，却满心都是隐秘的快乐，终于忍不住突然笑出声来。“你还记得吗，姆萨布，”他说，“那次你忘了我是一个基督徒，还以为我会害怕帮你一起扛那个‘米松乌姆塞’（老年白人）？”




作为一个基督徒，卡曼特也不再怕蛇。我听他向其他男孩声明：任何时候，基督徒都能脚踏巨蛇头顶，把它踩个稀巴烂。我没见他这么干过，但有一次，一条鼓蝮巨蝰(11)出现在厨师茅屋屋顶上时，我看到卡曼特站得很近，一动不动，脸色严肃，双手背在身后。所有的用人小孩都四散跑开，像风中的谷糠，远远地在四周大肆嚎叫。法拉进屋拿出我的步枪，一枪击毙了它。

一切都结束了，喧哗平息，马夫的儿子恩约尔问卡曼特：“卡曼特，为什么你没有把脚放在大坏蛇头上，把它踩个稀巴烂？”

“因为它在房顶上。”卡曼特说。




有一段时间，我试着开弓射箭。我很有力气，但要拉开法拉为我弄来的万德罗博(12)弓仍然很有难度；经过长期练习，我终于成为训练有素的弓箭手。

当时卡曼特年纪还小，我在草地上练习弓箭的时候，他总带着疑惑观察我，仿佛很想不通我的举动。一天他对我说：“用弓箭射击，还是基督徒吗？我认为基督徒的正途应该是用步枪。”

我给他看我的插图本《圣经》，举夏甲(13)之子的故事为例：“上帝与这位少年同在。他长大后，住在旷野里，成为一位弓箭手。”

“好，”卡曼特说，“他和你一样。”




卡曼特有一双灵巧的手，他照顾生病受伤的动物时和治疗我的原住民病人一样耐心细致。他取出过陷在狗爪里的刺和碎片，还医好过一只被蛇咬伤的狗。

有段日子，我在家里养了一只翅膀折断了的鹳，它性烈、大胆，每天在各房间里走来走去，每次进到我卧室里，都会展开激烈搏斗，以高视阔步和双翅的拍打，如手持轻剑一般，与镜中的自己决一死战。它跟着卡曼特在屋内屋外来回，使人不能不信：它将卡曼特僵硬慎重的步态学得惟妙惟肖。一人一鸟，腿一样细瘦。原住民小孩们看到了这滑稽一幕，每当这一对儿经过，就嘻嘻哈哈地欢呼。卡曼特知道他们在寻自己开心，但别人想什么，他不介意。他打发孩子们去池塘里为鹳找青蛙吃。

照管露露的，也是卡曼特。

一头瞪羚


露露是从树林里来大宅的，正如卡曼特来自草原。

农场以东静静卧着恩贡森林保护区，那里几乎全是未曾开发的处女林。我觉得伐倒原始森林，在原地种上桉树和银桦，是很不理智的行为；保留原貌才能为内罗毕提供游乐场和绝佳的风景区。

非洲原始森林是一个神奇的所在。骑马踏进这古老织帷的深处，有些地方已经褪色，另一些地方因年深而黯淡，而绿意浓厚得不可思议。那里完全看不到天色，阳光却千姿百态，从树叶间的空隙洒落下来，光斑嬉戏着。树上的灰色菌子像披散的长须，藤蔓植物四面八方盘旋垂挂，给这片原始森林添了一抹神秘难测的气氛。我经常在星期日和法拉一起骑马到那里去，因为那天农场无事可做。上下斜坡，穿过细细弯弯的林间清泉，空气清冷如水，溢满植物的清芬，雨季开始的时候，藤蔓花朵初绽，骑马经过其间，就是从一个芳香天界升向另一个芳香天界。有一种非洲月桂树，开着奶白色、黏黏的小碎花，甜美的芳香势不可挡，那味道像紫丁香，也像幽谷百合。随处可见一截截用皮绳挂在树上的空心树干；是基库尤人挂的，让蜜蜂在里面筑巢采蜜。一次，我们在林中刚刚拐了个弯，就看见一头花豹踞坐路上，遍体斑斓，浑若锦绣。

就在这里，半空中住着一个叽喳不休、永无宁日的家族——小灰猴。只要有一群猴子穿过林间道路，它们的味道便会在空气中存留很久，干干的，带着尿臊气，像腐鼠臭。当你骑在马上，会突然听见头顶上一阵刷刷声和跑动的飕飕声，仿佛军队过境。如果你原地停住不动，过一会儿，也许会瞥见一只小猴子坐在树上动也不动，再过片刻功夫，你会发现，围绕着你的整个森林都鲜活起来，小灰猴家族像果实一样停满枝头，阳光打在它们身上光影烁烁，因光线不同，它们的轮廓或黑或灰，每一只猴子的长尾巴都垂在身后。它们叫声怪异，像一记响吻之后跟着一串小咳嗽；如果你在地上模仿这种声音，你会看到猴子们的头不自然地左摇右摆着。假设你突然动了一下，刹那间，它们全不见了，一路折枝裂叶，你只能追随它们那渐远渐轻的噼啪声，直到它们消失在林间，像鱼儿隐没在波涛中。

酷热的一天，时值正午，在恩贡森林中，我穿过茂密林间一条狭窄的小径，看到了一头巨林猪——是极其稀少的动物，很少有人遇见过。它带着妻子和三头小猪，突然经过我身边，全家都疾速奔跑，看上去一模一样，像是黑纸上剪出来的大大小小的形象，身后是遍洒阳光的森绿。这一幕，像林中池塘里的倒影，像千年之前才会发生的事。

露露是一只幼年瞪羚，属于南非林羚种。南非林羚也许是非洲羚羊中最美的一支。它们比黄鹿稍大一点儿，住在树林里或者灌木丛间，羞怯易惊，一有风吹草动则逃之夭夭，所以它们不像草原上其他羚羊那么常见。恩贡山及环绕着它的田野是南非林羚生活的好地方，如果在山间野营，黎明或日暮时出来打猎，你会看到它们从灌木丛中跳出，跑进林间空地，在晨光或斜阳下，皮毛镀上了一层红铜光泽。雄羚羊有一对美丽的弯角。

露露是这样变成我家一员的：

一天早上，我开车从农场去内罗毕。不久前，农场里的咖啡加工厂失火焚毁，我不得不多次进城联系保险事宜，争取赔偿金；那是个绝早的清晨，我满脑子都是数字和报价单，经过恩贡公路时，一小群基库尤小孩站在路边对我呼喊，手里拎着一头非常小的羚羊，举高了给我看。我知道他们多半是在灌木丛中发现这只幼崽，想卖给我。但我在内罗毕与人有约，已经快迟到了，我没心思想这事，继续往前开。

晚上回来，我又一次经过此地，又一次，从路边传来了大声喊叫，这一小群孩子还在那儿，累了，倦了，也有点儿沮丧。一整个白昼，他们很可能试着把幼崽卖给过往的其他人，都落空了，现在很希望能在太阳下山前做成这笔买卖，于是把幼崽举高想打动我。但我在城里度过了漫长的一天，保险金又有些不顺利，我真懒得停车和他们说什么，径直扬长而去。到家后，我甚至没想到这件事，自顾吃饭上床睡觉。

刚刚沉沉睡去，我就被巨大的恐惧惊醒了。孩子们和小羚羊的身影凝聚成形，活生生地站在我面前，如此清晰，似是画就。我坐在床上，惊恐万状，仿佛有人在掐我的喉咙。我想，那些孩子们，在长日的炎热下，已经站了一整天。在捕获者手中的小羚羊，不知现在怎么样了，它是被揪着捆在一起的四脚举起来的。很显然它还小，不能自己觅食。我在一天里经过两次，仿佛是个祭司利未人(1)，对它视若未睹，现在，此时此刻，它在哪里？我真的害怕了，起身叫醒我所有的佣仆，告诉他们那只幼羊必须找到，第二天清晨之前给我送来，否则他们全都得被解雇。他们立刻开始集思广益。当天与我同乘一车的两个小仆，当时对孩子或者幼羊都像没留神；现在却站出来，详细告诉其他人时间地点还有那些孩子都是谁家的。是夜月光明丽，仆人们全部出动，在田野里四散寻觅，同时热烈地讨论着当前处境；我听到他们在反复陈述这个事实：如果这只羚羊找不到，他们就全都得卷铺盖。

第二天清早，法拉给我送早茶的时候，朱玛和他一起进来了，怀里抱着幼羊。它是雌性，我们叫它露露，人们告诉我，在斯瓦希里语中，是“珍珠”的意思。




露露当时只有一只猫那么大，深紫色的大眼睛很安静。它的双腿如此纤细，当它躺下站起，你会疑心，它们怎么经得起这一屈一伸。耳朵如丝光滑，极有表现力。鼻头黑得像黑松露。小小的蹄像三寸金莲，让它有一种中国旧式大家闺秀的风韵。把如此完美的事物捧在掌心，是多么宝贵的体验。

露露很快适应了大宅的生活和大宅里的人，完全进退自如，就像在自己家一样。第一个星期，房里打过蜡的地板对它来说是个困扰，每当它踏出地毯，四条腿就往四个方向滑；看着是个小可怜儿，但它并不烦恼，最后还是学会了在光溜溜的地板上走路。它的脚步声，听起来像一根手指一直在不停地敲桌子，声音不大，却带着愠意。它的每个生活习性都干净得惊人。它像小孩一样任性，每当想干什么被我阻止，它的样子就像在说：什么都比看得见摸不着强。

卡曼特是用奶瓶把露露带大的，不过晚上还是会把它关起来，因为我们得小心入夜后在屋子周围逡巡的花豹。它很依恋卡曼特，总是跟着他走来走去，每当觉得他不遂心意，小脑袋就在他的细腿上狠狠一撞。它是如此美丽，当你看到他们俩在一起，你不由得会想：活像一幅《美女与野兽》的反向荒谬插图。如此美丽优雅，露露在家中赢得了至高无上的地位，被所有人看重。

在非洲，除了苏格兰猎鹿犬，我没养过其他品种。再没有比这种狗更高贵、更通晓人性的了。它们与人类共同生活了许多世纪，对我们的生活方式以及自身的处境各方面都很有了解且如鱼得水。你会在老式油画及织锦画上看到它们的身影，因画面内容的不同，它们的外貌和举止也千变万化，但始终带着一种传统采邑制(2)遗留下来的气息。

我的第一只猎鹿犬，名叫黄昏，是人家送我的新婚礼物，它始终陪伴我左右，这么说吧，从我坐上“五月花号”(3)踏入非洲之旅开始。它性格勇敢，脾气温和，一战刚开始那几个月，我用牛车为政府做运输工作穿越马赛人居留区，途中一直带着它。两年后，它被斑马弄死了。露露来的时候，住在我家里的是黄昏的两个儿子。

苏格兰猎鹿犬对非洲的自然风光和非洲原住民都适应得非常好。也许是由于海拔——这三者都洋溢着高地风情——而在海平面上的蒙巴萨，它就显得没这么和谐。这雄伟空旷的视野里，单有平原、山巅和河流，仿佛并不完整，像缺了什么，直到猎鹿犬也出现在里面。所有的猎鹿犬都是好猎手，嗅觉比灵缇灵敏，但它们靠视力狩猎。看两只猎鹿犬并肩作战，最是大快人心。当我在野生动物保护区骑行的时候，总是带上它们，虽然这是不允许的。在那儿，它们把斑马牛羚惊得在草原上四散奔跑，宛如天堂上的群星都在天幕上疾驰而过。当我在马赛人居留区狩猎时，只要我带上了猎鹿犬，就绝不会让任何一只被射伤的猎物逃脱。

在原始森林里，它们也显得很美，沉沉的绿色阴影间，它们是暗暗的灰。就在这里，两只猎鹿犬中的一只，全凭一己之力，干掉了一只大个子雄性老狒狒，激战中，它的鼻子被狒狒咬穿了，堂堂仪表大受损害。不过农场上的众生都视之为一个光荣的疤痕，因为狒狒很有破坏性，原住民们很讨厌它们。

猎鹿犬们很聪明，知道我的仆人中谁是穆斯林，而穆斯林是不允许触碰狗的。

我在非洲的头几年，有一位名叫伊斯梅尔的索马里扛枪人，他去世时，我还在非洲。他是那种老式的扛枪人，现在已经没有这种人了。在本世纪初，他被那些佼佼不群的老一代狩猎行家培养成熟，当时非洲是名符其实的猎鹿乐园。他对文明社会的了解仅限于猎场，只会说与狩猎有关的英语，可以与我谈论那些或大或小的步枪。伊斯梅尔回到索马里兰后，我收到了一封他的信，寄给“雌狮布里克森(4)”，展信如下：“尊贵的雌狮”。伊斯梅尔是个地地道道的穆斯林，终其一生，从不触摸犬类，这给他的职业生涯带来许多困扰。但他对黄昏网开一面，甚至不介意它陪我一起乘坐骡车，还愿意让黄昏睡在自己的帐篷里。他说，黄昏一眼就能认出谁是穆斯林，绝不会与之身体接触。事实上，伊斯梅尔向我保证，黄昏一眼就能知道谁是虔诚的穆斯林。他有一次对我说：“我现在明白了，黄昏与你是一家的。它也对人笑。”

我的狗儿们现在也知晓露露在家中的地位与权力。这些伟大猎手的骄横在它面前化成柔情似水。它把它们从牛奶碗旁推走，轰它们离开炉火前最喜欢的位置。我在露露的脖圈上系了一枚小铃铛，一旦狗们听见“叮铃铃”的声音由远及近穿过房间，它们就会心甘情愿地一跃而起，离开壁炉前温暖舒适的窝，去房间的另一个角落躺下。露露走过去躺下，一举一动宛如一位倾城佳人，为了不挡其他人的道，端庄地收拢裙摆，优雅到无人匹敌。它啜饮牛奶时，带着一种有礼却略微不耐烦的态度，仿佛因女主人过分的殷勤而稍觉压力。它喜欢人给它搔耳后的部位，却表现得隐忍克制，仿佛一位年轻的小妻子，在降尊迂贵地接受丈夫对自己的轻怜蜜爱。

露露一天天长大，在花样年华里，它长成了一只纤细又丰盈的雌性瞪羚。从头到脚，它都美丽得令人难以置信，像一幅海涅诗篇(5)的工笔插图，诗中吟唱的是恒河波畔聪颖温柔的羚羊。

但露露其实并不真温柔，它体内有俗称的恶魔。它拥有最大限度的女性特质，就是表现出绝对的不可侵犯，它全心捍卫自己的完美存在。面对侵犯者，它都会实实在在、不遗余力狠狠反击回去。向谁？全世界。如果我的马招惹它不高兴了，它会失控得无法预测，向马一头撞过去。我还记得汉堡的老哈根贝克(6)说过：所有动物中，包括食肉动物，鹿(7)是最不可靠的。你可以信任一头花豹，但一旦对一头年轻的牡鹿不设防，早晚它会从背后偷袭你的。

露露一直是我家的骄傲，甚至它春心荡漾、表现得真像一个没羞没臊的小骚货时也一样；可我们始终没本事让它开心起来。有时它在屋子外面游荡几个钟头，甚至一个下午。有时它心血来潮，对周遭环境的不满到达顶点，会纯粹自发地，在屋前的草坪上，跳起雄姿勃勃的战舞：左扭右摆的舞姿，诡异的人字针步，像是在向撒旦做迫切的祷告。

“啊，露露，”我想，“我知道你力大无穷，你能轻松跳到超过你身高的高度。你现在对我们大发雷霆，恨不得我们统统都去死，如果你老人家肯拨冗来杀我们，我们真的会死。但事情不是你想的那样，不是我们把壁垒修得太高，让你不能跨越。我们怎么可能干这种事，你不是跳高名宿吗？实情是：我们根本没放置任何障碍。真正的力量在你体内，露露，障碍也同样在你体内，而让一切圆满的时机，还不曾来到。”

一天晚上，露露没有回家。一连一个星期，我们出外寻找它都空手而归。这对每个人都是一记沉重打击。仿佛一道明晰的光从家中消逝，现在我家与其他人家也没两样了。我想到河边的花豹，一晚跟卡曼特谈起了它们。

一如往常，他会等一段时间，理解了我的短浅见识，才答复我。过了几天，他来找我谈这事了。“你认为露露死了，姆萨布。”他说。

我不想这么直通通说出来，但我告诉他，我一直想弄明白它为什么还不回家。

“露露，”卡曼特说，“没有死，但它结婚了。”

这是个惊人的大喜讯，我问他怎么知道的。

“嗯，是的，”他说，“它结婚了，和它的博瓦纳(8)一道住在森林里。但它没忘掉这里的人，大多早晨都会回来。我在厨房后面为它撒了碎玉米，太阳快出来的时候，它从树林里走到那一边吃掉。它的先生和它在一起，但它很怕人，因为它没和人打过交道。它站在草地那一边的大白树下面，不敢到家这边来。”

我告诉卡曼特，他下一次看到露露的时候，带我也去。几天后，日出之前，他来了，喊我出去。

这是一个明媚的早晨。最后的晨星隐退，我们等待着露露。天空明净安详，我们行走在其中的世界却昏暗宁滞。草是湿的，树下的斜坡上闪着微微的露光，像暗旧的银。黎明空气清冷，肌肤微微刺痛，若在北国，这就意味着霜冻季节即将来临。而在这里，我觉得，不管你经历过多少次，仍然几乎不能相信，就在这凉爽与树荫间，几小时内，太阳将热力十足，天空发出灼灼白光，让人难以忍受。灰灰的薄雾笼罩山麓，为它勾勒出陌生的形状；如果有野牛此刻在附近的山脚吃草，会否觉得身处云中，而气候实在有点儿太冷。

跨越我头顶的苍穹渐渐溢满清明，宛如盛满酒的酒杯。刹那间，山峰之巅透出第一缕阳光，温柔地，尽染层林。渐渐地，随着地球向太阳的倾斜，山脚下的青草山坡披上一层瑰丽的金光，马赛人居留地的树林也被衬得矮了三分。河的这一侧，森林间，高大的树梢闪着铜红。肥硕的紫林鸽展翅高飞，它们在河对岸栖息，此刻飞入我的树林间觅食好望角金栗。每一年中，它们只在这里停留很短的一段时期。这种鸟飞行速度惊人，仿佛空中轻骑兵在突袭。因为这个缘故，我内罗毕的朋友们很喜欢早晨到农场来猎鸽；为了在旭日初升时分准时到我家，他们通常出发得很早，绕过大宅车道的时候，车灯还亮着。

在宁静的树荫下，伫立着，远远看向金色的山峦、明澈的天空，你会觉得仿佛你正真真切切地穿行在海底，波涛流过你身边，你正举头凝视着海平面。

一只鸟开始鸣唱，随即我听到，在森林里稍远处，传来一声铃铛的“叮咚”。啊，真开心呀，露露回来了，回到它的老家了！铃声近了，我跟随这铃声的节奏，判断着它的脚步。它走走，停停，又走起来。铃声绕过僮仆住的棚屋，它突然间出现在我们面前。看到一只羚羊离住宅如此之近，让人喜出望外，此时此刻也突然变得极不寻常。它静静站着，好像对见到卡曼特有心理准备，但对我没有。可它也没有跑开，看向我，目光中不带恐惧，也丝毫没有对往昔和我们小打小闹的留恋，自然也忘记了它是如何忘恩负义地离开，连只语片言也不曾留下。

树林间的露露，高傲独立，立场全然改变，不再是寄人篱下而是拥有一切。如果我碰巧邂逅一位流亡中的年轻公主，那时她对于王位来说，还只是个觊觎者；然后与她再次碰面，她已坐拥王位，江山在手。场面大概与此刻差堪相近。露露心中一无记恨，正如路易十三，曾表示他作为法国国王，把与奥尔良公爵之间的恩怨一笔勾销。现在，露露已经完全成熟，满腔挑衅的火气已经从它身上消逝；对谁攻击，为什么？它泰然而立，以王权神授的尊贵。它还记得我，知道不用怕我，这已经足够了。有一会儿工夫，它注视着我，紫眼儿烟波弥漫，不带感情，只是一眨也不眨，我想起来，神或者女神，都是从不眨眼的，我面对的，是生着牛眼的赫拉(9)。它走过我身边时，轻轻叼了片草叶，做了一个轻盈完美的小跳。它走向厨房后面，在那里，卡曼特已经在地上铺好了碎玉米。

卡曼特用一根手指碰碰我的手臂，随后指向树林。跟着他指引的方向，我看到一只雄羚羊站在一棵高高的好望角金栗树下，在森林外缘，它是一枚小小的茶色剪影，有一双漂亮的旋角，树桩一般纹丝不动。卡曼特打量了它一会儿，笑起来。

“看样子，”他说，“露露向它的先生解释过，这房子没什么可怕，但还是一样，它不敢过来。每天早晨，它都会想今天可得自头到尾走一趟，但是，临了，看到房子和人，又觉得有一块石头沉在胃里，”——原住民世界里胃痛司空见惯，经常妨碍农场工作——“然后又停在树下了。”

很长一段时间，露露总在黎明时到我家来，用清脆的铃声宣告，太阳已经升到山顶了。我常常躺在床上，等待着铃声响起。有时它有一两个星期没来，我们也会想念它，开始交头接耳打听谁去山里打过猎。但没多久，用人们就向我通报：“露露来了。”口气像在说出嫁的女儿回来了。有好几次，我在树林里看到那头雄羚羊的身影，但卡曼特是对的，它从来没有积起足够勇气，走完通向屋子的漫漫长路。

一天，我从内罗毕回来，卡曼特一直在厨房门外守候我，此刻走向前来，兴奋难抑，告诉我：今天露露到农场来了，带着它的幼崽。几天之后，我恰逢盛会，也见到了，它绕过小仆的草屋，高度警觉，绝不容人欺负作弄，一只非常小、非常小的幼羊跟在它身后，亦步亦趋，动作娇弱迟缓，恰如多年前，我们初遇露露时它的样子。雨季刚过，在漫长的夏季月份里，下午或者黎明破晓，我们经常发现露露在我家附近。甚至在日中它也来，躲在棚屋的荫凉处休息。

露露的幼崽不怕狗，会任由它们嗅遍自己全身，但它始终不习惯原住民或者我，一旦我们试图抱它，母子俩就会一起离开。

从它离家出走，露露就再没靠近我们到伸手可及的范围。其他方面它很随和，它明白我们想看它的宝宝，也会从一只伸出的手里叼走一截甘蔗。它走到开着的餐厅门口，若有所思地注视着微光中的房间，但绝不会再跨过门槛。这时铃铛已经丢了，它的来去，变得无声无息。

用人们建议我让他们把露露的幼崽抓回来养大，就像露露在我家长大一样。但我想，这样回报露露对我们的美好信任，太粗暴了。

对我来说，我家与羚羊之间的松散联系，是一桩极其稀有、弥足珍贵的事。露露能从旷野到这里来，足以说明我们的融洽，它的到来，把我家与非洲景观融为一体，成为其中一角，再也无人能说，哪里是结束，哪里又是开始。露露知晓巨林猪的洞穴，见过犀牛交配。在非洲，有一种布谷鸟，隐身在深深的林间，总在正午歌唱，那歌声像世界之心在咚咚作响，我从不曾有幸一睹芳容，我认识的任何人都不曾见过，因此无人能够告诉我它的样子。但可能露露走过狭窄青翠的羊肠小径时，小径位于一道树枝的下方，布谷鸟正安坐在上面。我曾经读过一本书，是讲大清帝国一位老太后(10)的：生子之后，年轻的叶赫那拉氏回娘家省亲，坐在金碧辉煌的轿子里离开紫禁城，衣锦还乡，威风八面。我的家，我觉得，现在就像这位年轻妃子的娘家一样。

两只羚羊，一大一小，整个夏天都在我家附近游荡；有时两三星期才来一次，也有时天天能看到它们。下个雨季开始的时候，仆人们告诉我，露露回来了，带来了一个新生的宝宝。我没有亲眼看到新幼崽，因为这一次它们离房子不算很近，后来我看到三只羚羊在森林里一起嬉戏。

露露与我家的联谊持续了很多年。它与它的家人们常常在大宅附近现身，在林子里进进出出，仿佛农场也不过是兽国的一个省份。绝大多数时间，它们在日落之前出现，先是在树林里活动，像纤巧的黑色剪影，映在一片深绿里，随后走出来在草地上吃草，余晖打在它们身上，把它们染成铜红色。露露总在其中，它离房子比较近，步态安闲，有车经过或者我们开窗时，就会竖起耳朵来；狗儿们都认识它。随着年纪渐长，它的毛色变深了。一次，我与一个朋友驾车到达房前时，发现三只羚羊正待在平台上，围着吃我撒给牛群的盐。

奇异的是，除了最初的那只成年雄羚羊——露露的先生——总是站在好望角金栗树下，高高昂着头之外，再没有其他雄羚羊出现在我家附近。好像我们应付的是一个森林母系氏族。

殖民地的猎人及自然学家对我的羚羊们都颇感兴趣，狩猎监督官亲自驱车到农场来看它们，而且看到了。一位通讯记者在《东非旗帜报》(11)上报道了这件事。

露露和它的家人聚在我旁边的日子，是我非洲生涯中最快乐的时光。为此，我始终把我与羚羊们的交往视为非洲赐予我巨大的恩惠、友谊的象征。整个荒原都在其中，是吉兆，是旧时的立约，是一首歌：

快来呀，我的爱，你可愿做一只牝鹿，抑或年轻的雄赤鹿，在那高高的山巅间。

我在非洲的最后几年里，我越来越少见到露露和它的家人。我离开前的那一年，它们一次也没出现过。一切都已经变了，我农场南部的土地已经交给承包商，那里森林被伐空，盖起了房子。曾经的空地上，是拖拉机载着货物来回奔驰。新来的居民很多都酷爱狩猎，枪声在田野间回荡。我相信，野生动物都撤向了西边，进入马赛人居留区的树林。

我不知道瞪羚能活多久，也许很久之前，露露就已经死了。

在破晓前的宁静时刻，我经常，真的极其频繁，梦到我听见露露的清脆铃铛声，在睡梦中我的心被喜悦充满。我醒了，渴望有什么甜蜜又特殊的事发生，就在此时，哪怕片刻光阴。

我躺在那里想念着露露，我想知道，在它的林中岁月里，是否梦见过铃声。它的脑海中，有没有人与狗的画面掠过，像水面的倒影？

我想，如果我通晓一首非洲的歌，一首长颈鹿之歌，新月之光落满它的背；一首田地犁铧之歌，咖啡收割工们汗湿满脸；那么，非洲知道关于我的歌吗？当风掠过，旷野是否因为一抹我穿过衣服的颜色而颤抖；孩子们能否发明一种新游戏，用我的名字命名；满月可会将一个酷似我的身影投在车道的鹅卵石上；而恩贡山上的鹰，会否四处将我找寻？

离开非洲后，我再不曾听到过露露的消息，但我有卡曼特的消息，也有其他非洲仆人的。我收到卡曼特最近一封信就是不出一个月前的事。而这些非洲来信以一种奇异的、不真实的方式到达我手里，使它们更像幻象或者海市蜃楼，而不像真实的讯息。

因为卡曼特不能读写，不懂英语，当他或其他人打算告诉我他们的近况时，就去找专职代客写信的印度人或者原住民，向他们口述要写在信里的内容。代笔人都坐在邮局门外，带着写字板、纸、钢笔和墨水，也对英语所知不多，勉强知道如何写，但他们自以为懂英语。为了夸耀技巧，在信里加了大量的花体字，使得内容难以辨认。他们还有一个习惯，就是喜欢用三到四种不同的墨水写信，不管动机为何，给人的印象就是他们缺少墨水，把每个墨水瓶底的最后一滴都吸干了。以上诸般结合起来的后果就是，你得到的讯息就像特尔斐神谕(12)。我收到的每封信里都有深藏的谜，你能感觉，一定有什么至关紧要的话，沉重地压在寄信人心头，让他不惜从基库尤人居留区长途跋涉到邮局。但这谜却被黑暗吞吃了。这一张便宜脏污的小纸片，历经千山万水，抵达你手中，好像有千言万语要诉说，甚至在对你大声呐喊，到头来，却什么也不曾告诉你。

在这件事上，也与其他绝大多数事一样，卡曼特异于常人。作为一位写信人，他有专属于他本人的方式。他把三四封信放在同一个信封里，再标注：“第一封信”、“第二封信”，以此类推。它们都写着一样的内容，重复了一遍又一遍。也许他是想借助重复来加深我的印象。他以前和我谈话时，如果有什么事特别希望我理解或者记住，也会这样做。而现在，远隔万里，能与朋友保持联系是多么困难，还要让他惜语如金可能更艰难。

卡曼特写道，他已经失业很长时间了。听到这个消息我并不惊讶，因为对于大众来说，他显得过分清高。只是，我培养出了第一流的厨师，却把他留在了一个面目全非的殖民地。在他身上发生的一切，仿佛“芝麻开门”的故事。现在，咒语失效，石门永久关闭，神秘的宝藏永远不会再见天日。无论这位出色的厨师走到哪里，他的饱学多才、沉思漫想，都无人得知。人们只见到一个罗圈腿的基库尤人，小矮子，有一张平板呆滞的脸。

到底卡曼特想说什么呢？当他走向内罗毕，站在贪婪傲慢的印度代笔人面前，让心里话穿越半个地球。信里字迹歪斜，语法乱七八糟。但卡曼特自有伟大的灵魂，让了解他的人能从这支离破碎、杂乱无章的音乐里听出动人曲调，好似听见了小牧童大卫(13)竖琴的回响。

这是“第二封信”：

我不会忘记你姆萨布，尊贵的姆萨布。现在你所有的仆人都再也高兴不起来了，因为你离开了这个国家。如果我们是鸟，就会飞去看你，然后再回来。以前你的农场真是个好地方，对于母牛、小牛还有我们黑人都是。现在那里什么都没有，牛、山羊、绵羊，那里都没有。现在所有的坏蛋都打心眼里高兴，因为你的老仆人们都变成穷光蛋了。现在上帝心里知道，有时会帮助你的用人。

而在“第三封信”里，卡曼特给我们演示了原住民以何种方式对你表达心中情意，他写道：

如果你回来，写信告诉我们。我们认为你会回来的。因为什么？我们认为你永远不可能忘掉我们。因为什么？我们认为你会一直记得我们的脸和我们母亲的名字。

一个白人想表达美好情意时，会写：“我永远不会忘掉你。”非洲人说：“我们认为，你永远不会忘掉我们。”

农场上的枪击事故





枪击事故


十二月十九号晚上，上床之前，我走出门外看看明天会否下雨。此刻在高原上，相信很多农人也在做同样的事。有时遇到好年景，圣诞节前后，会下几场痛快的大雨，对年轻的咖啡树来说，不啻于天降福音。它们是在十月的几场大雨后开花结实的。今晚没有下雨的迹象。天空晴朗，繁星灿烂，静谧而壮丽。

赤道的星空远比北方璀璨。因为夜间户外活动多，看到繁星的机会也更多。北欧冬夜太冷，无法气定神闲地赏星；而夏季的清明夜空中，星光黯淡，野生紫罗兰一般苍白。

赤道之夜拥有罗马天主教堂般广结善缘的气氛，与北方新教教堂迥异，后者是标榜无事免入的。天主教堂有高广大室，人出人进，诸般琐事在轮转不休。对阿拉伯和非洲来说，正午的烈日足以将人晒伤晒死，夜间才是旅行和交易的时间。在这里，星辰多年前已被命名，几千年来，一直指示着人类的方向，引领他们排成长队穿过沙漠和海洋，一列向西，另一列向东，或者向南向北。晚上开车很愉快，在星空底下驾驶车辆，真是心驰神荡，你渐渐养成习惯，把与内地朋友的约会订在下个满月时。你在新月初升的日子开始狩猎远征，这样就有一个月完完整整的好月光可以享受。当你回欧洲做客，发现城里朋友们的所有举措都与月令无关，事实上，他们根本没留意到月亮的脚步，你会很诧异。新月是赫蒂彻商队(1)的信号灯，当它翩然出现在天际，就是他们出发的时分。他曾凝视着明月，成为“编织宇宙间月光之网的哲人”。他一定频频举头向月，月亮遂成为他征服世界的象征。

在农场上，有很多次我偶然成为第一个看到新月的人，夕阳西下时分，它是一弯细细的银钩。我因此在原住民中很出名；特别是有两三个年份，是我最早发现斋月(2)——穆斯林的圣月——的第一枚月牙儿。

农人缓缓地环视地平线。先是东方，因为东方将是雨来的方向，处女座的角宿一散放清辉；随后向南方问候一下南十字星座——大千世界的守护神，旅人的忠实朋友，深受他们爱戴；再往上，在璀灿银河的光带之下，是半人马座的阿尔法与贝塔星；望西南，天狼星光芒四射，在天宇间辉煌耀目，而船底座的老人星仿佛若有所思；西方，在恩贡山隐约的轮廓上方，是三颗庄严夺目的星辰，参宿七、参宿四和参宿五，如未经切割打磨的钻石明灯。他最后转向北方，因为北方是我们最终的归宿。在那里，大熊星座孤零零闪耀着，唯有它静静地高悬在他头上。那光，仿佛隔着整个宇宙看穿了他，带着一种熊头熊脑的笨拙滑稽气氛，愉悦了北欧移民的心。

夜间酣睡入梦的人，懂得一种特殊的幸福，为白昼世界所不具备：静恬的狂喜，心的平和，恰如舌尖上的蜜糖。梦的真正光彩，人们知道，来自它一无羁绊的自由意境。这并非暴君的自由，将自己的意志强加给全世界；而是艺术家的自由，别无他念，摆脱了意欲。真正梦者的乐趣不在于梦的内容，而在于：梦里发生的万般事，都不受他自身的束缚，完全超越他的控制。绚丽风物自行产生，极目所见，是无边无际的景象。五颜六色，七彩缤纷，道路房屋，都是他从未目睹也不曾耳闻过的。陌生人浮现，或友或敌，即便做梦人从来无缘与他们相识。飞行与追逐的意念在梦中一一再现，同样令人心醉神迷。梦中人人舌灿莲花。而一旦在白天记起，这些言行势必都黯然失色，索然无趣，因为它们属于另一个时空。一旦梦者在夜间躺下，此情此景又聚拢而来，那些绝妙得以重温。从头到尾，这无边无际的自由况味环绕着他，在他周身流动，如空气，也如光，一种超凡出尘的轻快。此刻，他身处高位，无所事事，但天下万物，都是为了令他富足和喜乐，全唾手可得；他施(3)国王也向他奉上礼物。他参加伟大战役或者盛大舞会，想知道他该怎么做：在这些盛事里面，他是否有特权想睡就睡。当你开始失去对自由的觉知，当“必要性”的意识终于进入梦的世界，当无论何处都匆匆忙忙，有一封信等你去写、一列火车等你去赶，当你必须去工作，让梦之骏马疾驰，在梦中扣动步枪的扳机……美梦开始退场，转而成为夜魇，沦入最贫乏最粗俗的梦之阶层。

在觉醒世界里，最接近梦的乃是都市之夜，在那里，人与人都互不相识，也无人知悉非洲之夜。那里也有无际的自由：万事万物都在运转，命运在你周围瞬息万变，四面八方都有暗潮涌动——却都与你无关。

而在非洲，一旦太阳下山，空中顿时满目蝙蝠，四处游弋，如汽车无声地驶过沥青路面；夜鹰挥翅掠过——有时，它蹲在路上，当你的车开近，它的眼睛会泛着车灯的红光，就在你的车轮前，它振翅而起，高飞入云。小小的春兔也跑到路上，大摇大摆地自行其路，一会儿急蹲，一会儿又跳将起来，节奏分明，像迷你小袋鼠。蟋蟀在高高草丛里吟唱着无止无休的歌谣，大地散发芬芳，流星划过天际，像滑过面颊的泪珠。恰是为了你，这一切才会发生，他施国王为你奉上礼物。

就在几千米之外的马赛人居留区，斑马正在更换草场，一群群斑马漫游在灰色草原间，像草原上一道道浅色条纹，野牛也出来了，在长长的山坡上吃草。我农场上的年轻人走过来了，三三两两，鱼贯而行，在草地上投下狭长的黑色身影。他们匆匆赶路，忙着自己的事，并非为我工作，也不与我相干。为了强调自己身有要务，当他们看到我扔在屋外地上、余烬未熄的烟头时，也不停下来，只是放慢脚步，边走边与我打招呼。

“你好，姆萨布！”

“你们好，莫拉尼（武士），你们去哪里？”

“我们去卡塞古村。今晚那里有大型恩贡玛(4)。再见，姆萨布。”

如果结伴赴舞会的队伍更大，他们会随身带上自己的羊皮鼓，你会听到遥远的地方传来隐约的鼓声，仿佛夜的指尖上小小脉管的悸动。突然间，对耳朵来说，与其说是听见，不如说是感知到空气的剧烈振荡——极远处，有短促的狮吼。狮子在漫步，狮子在狩猎，一切流转如常，在我们之外，在属于它的地盘上。这声音并非周而复始，而是陡然间拓宽了世界的尽头；长长的水渠、深深的泉眼，都会被这一声吼带到你眼前。

当我在房前伫立，忽然听见不远处有一声枪响。只有一声。随后还是无穷无尽的夜之寂静，笼罩四野。连蟋蟀也安静下来，侧耳聆听，过了一会儿，我才听见它们在草丛中唱起单调的小曲儿，仿佛此刻又重新开篇。

夜里这孤零零的一声枪响，听起来很奇怪，仿佛有什么决定性的事发生，与生死有关。好像有人向你大声疾呼，却只喊出一声，之后就哑然。我稍站了片刻，想知道发生了什么事。晚上的这个时间，环境太暗，不能瞄准狩猎，而如果是为了惊走什么东西，应该开个两三枪才是。

也许是我加工厂里的老印度工匠普莱·辛格，对几只溜进工厂院子的鬣狗开枪，它们吃悬挂晾晒的牛皮带——下面坠着石头，用来制作马车缰绳。普莱·辛格不是英雄，但他很可能为了他的缰绳，把茅屋的门开个半扇，从门里扣动霰弹枪。但即便如此，他也多半会放两枪，一旦尝到英雄主义的甜头，鬣狗吓得四散逃窜，他还可能乘胜追击，再装弹射上几枪。但一声枪响——随后鸦雀无声？

第二枪，我等了好一阵，抬头仰望夜空，仍然一无雨意。最后我还是带着一本书上床去了，只留下一盏灯还亮着。在非洲，偶尔得到一本值得一读的书——是通过糟糕之极的订购服务，靠精良大船从万里之外的欧洲托运来的——你阅读得如饥似渴，与作者渴望遇到知音的心情一样急切。你向上帝祈祷，但愿全书能像开头一样引人入胜。你的思绪沿着一条翠色欲滴的小径，飞奔着，驰骋着。

两分钟后，一辆摩托车以惊人的速度疾驰过车道，绕过宅子，停在正门口，有人重重地在拍起居室的落地长窗。我套上裙子外衣，穿上鞋，带上灯出来。门外是我的咖啡厂经理，在灯光下，他双目圆睁，汗流满面。他名叫贝尔纳普，美国人，异常能干，是极有灵性的机械师，但情绪很不稳定。对他来说，事物要么好到如同黄金时代，要么坏到一丝希望也没有。我刚开始聘用他的时候，经常被他弄得心烦意乱。他对生活、对农场的现状和未来，观点一日三变，好像将我置于大幅度的精神振荡中，后来我渐渐习惯了。这些起起落落，对生机勃勃的性格而言，不过是一些逐日可见的感情波澜：他太渴望能在实际生活中大展身手，却太少有事情发生。在非洲精力旺盛的年轻白人中，特别是在城市度过早年岁月的那一批，这是普遍现象。此时，他刚刚脱开悲剧之手，还没决定该浓墨重彩渲染一番，以满足灵魂的饥渴，还是尽量轻描淡写，以稍减命运的残酷无情。进退两难，他看上去像个刚刚逃脱生天的小男孩，前来结结巴巴地宣告大祸临头。最后这事他也没派上用场，这里面没有多少他的戏份，宿命又一次辜负了他。

此时，法拉也从自己屋子里出来了，和我一起听他的叙述。

贝尔纳普告诉我，悲剧是怎么在平和喜悦的气氛下启幕的。厨师放假一天，趁他不在，七岁的厨房小工卡贝罗举办了一场派对——他父亲是我的一个老棚民，也是农场最近的邻居，人称老狐狸卡尼努。随着夜色加深，众人兴致正高，卡贝罗把经理的枪拿进来，在他的住在自留地和荒野上的野孩子朋友们面前，表演白人的做派。贝尔纳普精于饲养家禽，经常在内罗毕拍卖会上收购种鸡，还养了很多阉公鸡和阉母鸡。他在走廊上挂了一把猎枪，用来吓唬驱赶老鹰和薮猫。事后谈及此事时，贝尔纳普坚称里面没有上子弹，是孩子们找到弹匣自己装弹上膛的。但我认为他记错了，即使孩子们有心这么做也没这本事，更可能是他把枪挂在走廊上时，忘了退里面的子弹。不管怎么回事儿，反正当年轻莽撞、精力充沛的卡贝罗操枪在手时，弹匣是在枪膛里的，而他瞄准自己的小客人们，扣动了扳机。枪声震撼了整座房子。三个孩子受了轻伤，吓得逃出了厨房。现在里面还有两个人，重伤，也可能已经死了。说到最后，贝尔纳普对非洲大陆以及这里发生的种种长篇大论地诅咒了一番。

他讲着讲着，仆人们也都出来了，一声不吭地听着；他们随即又进去拿出防风灯来。我们拿上包扎和消毒的用品。发动汽车太费时间，我们就飞快地跑过树林，直奔贝尔纳普的住处。防风灯摇曳着，把我们的影子从小路的这一边投向另一边。一路跑，迎面扑来连绵的惨叫声：短促、凄厉、嘶哑——一个孩子垂死的哀鸣。

厨房门户大开，仿佛死神一头冲进去之后，又一头冲了出来，只留下满地惨剧的残骸，像被獾洗劫过的鸡舍。桌上燃着一盏厨灯，烟雾腾腾，狭小室内，弹药的味道弥漫不去。枪就搁在桌上灯的旁边。厨房里到处是血，我在地板上滑了一跤，跌进血泊。防风灯很难集中光束直接照亮某一处，却能将整个房间或者区域照得无比鲜明；我印象中，防风灯的光线下看到的景物，远比其他情况下清晰难忘。

我认识被射中的两个孩子，他们曾在农场的草地上放牧羊群。瓦麦，乔戈纳的儿子，是个非常活泼的小男孩，在夜校读过书，现在就躺在门与餐桌之间的地板上。还没断气，却已危在旦夕，早已不省人事，只偶尔呻吟几声。为了方便行动，我们把他抬到一边。正在惨叫的孩子是万扬格里，厨房派对中年纪最小的一个。他坐着，朝着灯的方向，身体前倾；血从他脸上——如果还能称为脸的话——喷涌而出，像水柱一般激射出来。开火时，他一定正站在枪管前方，子弹把他整个下巴都打掉了。他双臂在身体两侧上下挥舞，就像水泵的摇臂，又像被切掉头的鸡在扇动着翅膀瞎扑腾。

被突然带到这样的惨祸现场，脑海中顿时只有一个念头，是狩猎场以及农场田野里的处理之道：不计代价，一枪了事，尽快了结他的痛苦。但你知道不能够，你的大脑在恐惧中飞快运转。我把手放在这孩子头上，绝望地安抚着他。就好像我真的取了他的性命一般，他停止惨叫，直挺挺坐着，手臂垂了下去，仿佛变成了个木头人。我意识到，我双手的压力，让他觉得救星来了。

为一位半张脸被打掉的伤者包扎是很困难的，止血所需要的步骤有可能令他窒息。我把万扬格里放在法拉膝上，让法拉帮我把他的头保持在适当的姿势上，一旦他的头前倾，就无法拉紧绷带，而一旦后仰，血又会流出来灌满他的喉咙。最后，他一动不动，我终于包扎成功。

我们把瓦麦抬到桌上，举灯仔细端详。子弹正中他的喉部胸部，他伤势沉重，血却流得不多，只是细细的一线从他嘴边流下。这个原住民孩子，平时像一只小鹿般活蹦乱跳，此刻这么安静，真令人震惊。就在我们眼前，他的脸色变了，呈现出一种万分惊愕的表情。我派法拉回家取车，必须马上送两个孩子去医院，刻不容缓。

等车的工夫，我问起卡贝罗的情况，就是这个孩子开了枪，酿成滔天血祸。贝尔纳普给我讲了他的故事，真叫人哭笑不得。一两天前，卡贝罗从经理那里买了一条旧短裤，说定从薪水里扣除一卢比以抵裤款。枪响后，贝尔纳普冲到厨房时，卡贝罗正站在厨房中央，冒烟的枪还拿在手中。他目瞪口呆地向贝尔纳普盯了一秒钟，左手插进裤袋——刚买的那条旧短裤，为了派对特意穿上的——掏出一卢比放在桌上。同时，右手将枪扔到桌上。如此结清了对世界的欠债后，他走了。虽然我们当时还并不知晓，事实上他就这样扬长而去，从地球表面销声匿迹了。对原住民来说，这是个不寻常的举动，因为他们对债务，特别是欠白人的，从不放在心上，总是置之不理。也许那一刻，对卡贝罗来说，太像最后审判，他自觉有义务倾全力偿付；也许他试图在危急关头，拯救一个朋友。或者是这惊恐、这轰鸣声、周围朋友的死亡，纷至沓来，打垮了这男孩狭小的理智地带，许多外部的细枝末节一下子全涌进了他意识的中央区域。

那段日子我开的是一辆老旧的越野车。我不会说它的坏话，因为它兢兢业业为我服务好多年。但它几乎很少有两个以上汽缸能同时工作的时候。车灯也失灵了，我开车去穆海迦俱乐部跳舞的时候，得在车后用一块大红丝绸手帕系一盏防风灯充当尾灯。得用人力推，它才能发动，特别是那晚，我们花了很长时间才发动它。

我家访客总在抱怨路况，经过那一晚的生死时速，我才发现他们是对的。起初我让法拉驾驶，却觉得他简直是有意开到所有大坑深洼和路上的马车辙里，于是我接过方向盘，自己开车。为此，我还得先到池塘边，在漆黑的水里洗掉手上的鲜血。通往内罗毕的漫漫长路仿佛永无尽境。我开了那么久，觉得很可能足以一直开到丹麦老家了。

内罗毕原住民医院坐落在城市入口前的山上。此刻夜色漆黑，十分安静。我们费了很大劲才叫开门，最后我好不容易抓住一个穿着一件样式古怪的睡衣的老年果阿族(5)医生或医生助理。他是个大胖子，心平气和，总是用一种奇怪的方式在做同一个手势，先用一只手，再换一只手。当我帮忙把瓦麦从车里抬出来，我感到他挣扎了一下，身体轻微地伸了一伸，我们把他抬进灯火通明的医院诊室时，他已经死了。老果阿人对他一直在摆手，说：“他死了。”转向万扬格里：“他还活着。”我再没见过这位老人，因为我再也没在晚上到过医院，很可能他只上夜班。当时，我很反感他的态度，但之后我觉得，仿佛那一位位医护人员，一件件白大褂里面的，其实是命运女神本人，一个叠一个，站在医院门口迎接我们，全不徇私地立判生死。

当我们把万扬格里抬进医院的时候，他从昏迷中苏醒了，立刻陷入了极度惊慌。他不肯被一个人留下，紧抓着我以及任何靠近他身边的人，在剧痛里号啕大哭。最后果阿老人给他打了一针，让他安定下来，果阿老人从镜片上方看我，说：“他还活着。”我把孩子们留在那里，一死一生，两副担架上，生死有别。

贝尔纳普骑着摩托车跟我们同来，主要是担心车可能在半路上抛锚，他要帮忙推车发动。现在他认为，我们应该向警察局报告这一事故。于是我们开车进城，在内罗毕夜生活中长驱直入，前往滨河路警署。我们到的时候，那里没有白人警官，其他人出去找他，我们就在车里坐等。街道上种满桉树，高原上早期开发的城镇遍植此树。在晚上，它们特别细长的树叶散发着一种特殊的可人芳香，在街道的光晕中显得奇形怪状。一个高大丰满的斯瓦希里年轻妇女被一群原住民警察推搡着拖进警署，她全力反抗着，抓他们的脸，叫得像杀猪一样。一群打架斗殴的小伙子被带了进来，仍然激情高涨，甚至在警署的台阶上还彼此追打。可能是一个贼刚刚被人赃并获，从街上被押过来，身后跑着一长串夜游神，有人为他辩护，有人站在警察那边，高声讨论案情。最后，一个年轻的警官来了，我猜是直接从一次开心的派对上赶过来的。他令贝尔纳普大失所望，因为他做笔录时，起初饶有兴趣，写得飞快，之后就心不在焉，笔尖缓缓拖过纸面，最后索性搁笔不写，把笔放回袋中。夜间寒气逼人。终于，我们能够开车回家了。

第二天早上，我还高卧未起，却分明意识到，在屋外那凝重的安静下，聚集了很多人。我知道他们是谁：农场里的老人们，蹲在石头上，嚼着烟叶，吸着鼻烟，一边吐痰，一边交头接耳。我也知道他们想要干什么：他们是来通知我，他们打算就昨晚的枪击事件及孩子们的丧事，召开一次长老会议。

长老会议就是农场里年长者们的议会，由政府授权，处理棚民们之间的地方性纠纷。一旦有罪案或事故发生，长老会议的成员们就聚集起来，座谈好几个星期，一边贪婪地大吃着羊肉，一边聊着这起灾祸。我知道，现在这些老人们打算同我攀谈这整桩事的来龙去脉，也希望——如果他们办得到——最后让我出席会议做出最终裁决。此时我不想就昨晚的悲剧进行无休无止的讨论，于是叫人为我备马，打算出门避开他们。

不出我所料，我一出房门就发现，房子左侧的仆人住处旁，老人们围成一圈。为了维护长老会议的尊严，他们假装没看到我，直到意识到我要出门，才匆匆忙忙迈动老腿，踉踉跄跄追过来，向我频频挥手。我也向他们挥手回应，然后策马而去。

在野生动物保护区驭马而行


我骑马前往马赛人居留区。要到那里，先得穿越一条河流，继续骑大概一刻钟左右，就会进入野生动物保护区。我在农场上那段时间，为了找可以骑马过河的地方，可花了不少工夫。河的这一边，下坡多石，河的对岸，上坡又相当陡峭，但“步入桃源——何其心旷神怡”。

在你面前，是几百里的路程，芳草萋萋，起起伏伏的原野一望无际，任你纵马飞奔；一无篱笆，也无沟渠，当然更不见道路。一无人烟，除了马赛人的村落，而自从这支人数众多的游牧民族驱赶着畜群去了另一个草场，它们都已荒置半年。低矮的荆棘树规则地铺展在原野里。一条条幽深狭长的溪谷，谷底的河床早已干涸，裸露着一块块平坦的大石头，要找出一条鹿走过的小径，循着它才能穿过溪谷。只需片刻光阴，你就能意识到旷野间有多么幽静。我曾触景生情地写过一首诗：

高草在旷野起伏推进，

劲风一阵阵吹拂着；

在孤独与寂寞之中，

旷野、疾风与我的心徜徉游乐。



现在回望我的非洲生活，我觉得它完全可以被描述成：一个人，来自繁忙嘈杂的十丈红尘，进入一个沉寂的国度，从此成为一个宁静的存在。

每当雨季前几天，马赛人放火烧荒，大地一片漆黑，满目废物，是不适合漫游其间的：马蹄会扬起黑色的焦灰，落满你一身，迷了你的眼睛；被烧过的草茬像玻璃碴一样锋利，你的狗在上面会划伤脚。但雨季一来，大地上就长出新的草叶，如此幼嫩，骑马穿行其上，像马蹄下铺了一层弹簧，马儿也兴奋得有点儿小癫狂。各种各样的瞪羚都来到绿地上吃草，像摆在绿呢台球桌上的玩具动物。你也许会骑马误闯进大羚羊群。这些体形庞大、性情平和的动物，会容你靠得很近，才慢吞吞小步走开。它们长长的犄角向后弯曲，越过挺起的脖颈，前胸皮肤松垂，闲庭信步时不断晃荡，使它们整体看上去像个正方形。它们仿佛是从古老的埃及碑刻壁画走下来的，而在当时当地，是拿大羚羊来犁地的，这使得它们有一种亲切的家养气息。长颈鹿总待在野生动物保护区的远处。

有时，在雨季的第一个月里，保护区里会开满一种粉粉白、香喷喷的野花，铺天盖地，大地宛如被积雪覆盖。

从人类世界进入动物世界；我的心还因为昨夜的惨剧而沉重。聚坐在我屋外的老人令我不安；古时候，当人们觉得邻居中有个女巫在对他们作祟，或者在衣服下面藏着一个用他们名字命名的蜡娃娃，一定也会有类似的感觉。

在农场的法律事务上，我与原住民的关系非常奇特。既然我无比希望这块土地太太平平的，我就不能对他们袖手旁观。棚民之间的争执，但凡不被正式解决，就会像你在非洲染上的、当地人称之为“沙漠疮”(1)的疥疮：如果你听任不管，表面上疮口合拢，但在底下，溃烂却一路发展，越来越深，直到你把它连根挖却，彻底清理。原住民自己也意识到这一点，一旦真心想解决什么事务，就会请我来定夺。

我对他们的律法一无所知，所以在神圣的审判庭上，我显得格格不入，像一个一句台词也记不起的首席女主角，全靠其他配角的提词才能混下去。不过老人们很愿意自告奋勇，动员全部才智和耐心来配合我。有时他们惹毛了我，我作为首席女主角，觉得自己的角色像个笑话，拒绝再玩，步下舞台。逢其变生不测，我的观众们会将其视之为命运魔掌的一记痛击，是上帝出乎意料的所为。他们只沉默地注视着，吐着口水。

关于公正的概念在欧洲和非洲很不一致，而且双方都觉得对方不可理喻。对非洲人来说，要平衡已经造成的灾害，别无他途，只有赔偿一种方式，行为的动机不被考虑。无论你是在黑夜中埋伏，等敌人经过时切断他的喉咙；抑或你只是砍了棵树，一个冒冒失失的过路人不慎经过被压死了——对原住民来说，都是一回事：同过则同罚。给社会造成的损失，也必须补偿，无论在哪里，无论是什么人。原住民无暇也无意去衡量是非功罪；也许是害怕会走得太远，也许是觉得事不关己。但他们愿意把全部心力投注于无止境的讨价还价中，争论哪种罪行或灾祸能用多少山羊和绵羊来衡量——时间对他们来说，一文不值；他们郑重地把你引入诡辩的汪洋迷沼。在当时，这有悖于我的是非观。

所有非洲人在这方面的礼俗都是一模一样的。索马里人气质与基库尤人迥异，根本看不起基库尤人，可是他们也会坐下来，以同样的方式对谋杀、强奸或者诈骗称斤算两，用故乡索马里兰的畜群当作计价单位——那些心爱母驼和骏马的名字及谱系，他们都历历在心，念念不忘。

有一次，不幸的消息传到内罗毕：法拉的一个10岁大的弟弟，在一个叫布拉穆尔的地方，捡起石头打伤了另一部落的一个男孩，那男孩的两颗门牙被打掉了。为了这事，两个部落的代表们在农场聚于一堂，坐在法拉屋内的地板上彻夜讨论这件事。瘦骨嶙峋的老人来了，他们曾去麦加朝过圣，裹着绿头巾；年轻气盛的索马里小伙子来了，当他们没有正经事要做的时候，就去给欧洲旅行家或猎手扛枪；黑眼圆脸的男孩们，腼腆地充当自家的代表，不发一言，只专注聆听学习。法拉告诉我：兹事体大，因为那个男孩完全破了相，当他到了男大当婚的年纪，会因此择偶困难，不得不降低对新娘外貌及出身的要求。最后，赔偿定为五十头骆驼。整个驼群为一百头，这就是半个驼群。五十头骆驼当时就从遥远的索马里兰买下，十年后，它将成为一个索马里少女的身价，令她对新郎两颗缺失的门牙视而不见；也许悲剧的基石就此铺下。法拉倒觉得这处理很轻省，免了之后的多少麻烦。

农场上的原住民完全不知道我对他们法律体系的不以为然，每当不幸发生，他们找我，首先就是为了赔偿。

有一回，在咖啡收获的季节，一个名叫瓦姆波依的基库尤少女在大宅门外被牛车撞倒轧死了。那时候，牛车正从地里往厂里运咖啡，我严禁任何人搭乘。否则，每一趟牛车，都会挤满收咖啡的姑娘和孩子们，一起穿过农场，成为一场慢悠悠的欢快旅程。这对牛来说，负载太重了。何况人人都走得比牛快。但是年轻的车夫们很难把这些眼神迷离如梦的女孩子赶开，她们总是追在车旁，一边跑，一边央求他们让她们开心一下；所以，他们往往就心软了，只是告诉她们，一旦道路拐进我视线范围内，就得立刻下车。但瓦姆波依跳车的时候摔了一跤，牛车轧过她小小的黑脑袋，头盖骨被碾碎；车辙里流过一痕细细的血。

我派人找来她的老父母，他们从采摘园里赶来，扑在她身上号啕大哭。我知道这对于他们是一笔沉重的损失，因为这姑娘已到了成婚的年纪，她的身价钱将是一笔不小的收入：绵羊、山羊和一两头小母牛。这是从她呱呱坠地，他们就指望着的。我正在考虑应该如何救济他们，他们已经先发制人拦住我，把满腔愤恨发泄到我身上，要求高额赔偿。

不，我说，我不会赔。我已经通知过农场的姑娘们，不允许乘坐牛车，所有人都知道。两个老人点头称是，完全认可，但仍坚持赔偿。他们的观点就是：总得有人赔。他们只听从自己头脑里的原则，没什么比这片土地上的共生互补理论更大的了。我不想再废话，转身回家。并非贪婪或者恶毒让他们紧紧跟在我身后，仿佛我身上有磁性，他们是被自然法则吸引着。

他们就坐在我窗外，守株待兔。他们是穷苦人，个子瘦小，营养不良，看上去像一对我草坪上的小獾。太阳下山了，他们还坐在那儿一动不动，几乎很难把他们和野草区分开来。他们深陷在悲痛中，骨肉分离，经济上蒙受损失，人财两空构成压垮一切的绝望。法拉那天外出了，因为他不在家，点灯的时候，我派人送了些钱给他们，让他们买头羊吃。这一举动很是糟糕，他们视之为困城中灯尽油干的第一个信号，索性坐到了夜里。我不知道他们是不是没打算离开，直到夜深时分，他们突然心生一念：年轻的车夫应该赔偿他们。这念头让他们从草丛中站起来，一言不发，突然离开，第二天一清早就奔向了达戈莱蒂(2)，地区长官助理就住在那里。

这给农场带来了一场旷日持久的谋杀案官司，招来了很多趾高气扬的年轻原住民警察。但长官助理能为他们做的，就是要把车夫以谋杀罪名吊死；当他发现证据不足时，又放弃了。长官助理与我都置之不理，老人们也无法就这件事召开元老会议。到最后，两位老人认命了，屈服于共生互补的理论，虽然他们对此一窍不通，其他人也一样。

我渐渐对长老会议的元老们厌烦了，对他们直言不讳。“你们这些老家伙，”我说，“只会罚年轻人款，就是为了让他们攒不下钱。年轻人奈何不得你们，你们就能自己把姑娘们全买下来。”老人们听得很认真，他们干瘪枯皱的脸上，小小的黑眼珠闪闪发光，薄薄的嘴唇蠕动着，仿佛在重复我的话；他们听得很高兴，仿佛是第一次，有人用语言说出了一个无懈可击的真理。

由于观念上的种种分歧，对基库尤人来说，我出任法官，实属大有可为。而对我来说，也是桩好事。我那时还年轻，经常在思索正义与非正义，但多半是站在被告的那一方，还不曾站在法官的角度考虑过。要裁决得当，也为了农场的安宁，我真是煞费苦心。有时，当问题十分棘手，我必须闭门谢客，反反复复绞尽脑汁。我满脑子都是各种思考，像披了一件隔绝一切的斗篷：谁也别来烦我，谁也别和我提这件事。农场中人都被我的这种表现深深打动了。很久之后，我还听他们饱含敬意地提起某案件：那么错综复杂，谁也不能在一星期之内断案。你永远能让原住民印象深刻，只须多耗费时间，超过解决一件事真正需要的时间就可以。只不过，这样操作起来很辛苦。

为什么原住民希望我替天行道，为什么他们如此尊重我的裁决，解释只怕要从他们的神话式或神学式的心态上来找。欧洲人早已丧失自创神话或者信条的天赋，需要时，我们就依赖过去为我们提供的资源。而在这条深不见底、阴影重重的小路上，非洲人的思想却走得自然而然、轻松自如。这一天赋在他们与白人的交往中表现得十分醒目。

你能从他们给欧洲人起的别名中领悟这一点，和原住民打过交道的欧洲人，多半没多久，就会被分配个别名。你非得知道这些名字不可，假设你想托信使给朋友送封信，或者坐在车上打听去朋友家的路，因为原住民世界只认识他的别名，其他名字一概不知。我有一位孤僻的邻居，从不在家里招待宾客，得名“沙哈尼·莫加”——单份餐具；我的瑞典朋友艾里克·奥特人称“里沙西·莫加”——一颗子弹——这是指他枪法绝佳，一头猎物从不需要第二颗子弹。这是个好名字，广为人知。我的熟人中，有一位狂热的赛车手，被称为“半人-半车”。当原住民用动物来命名白人——鱼、长颈鹿、大胖牛——他们的脑海里，一定流过古老的寓言故事。我相信，这些白人的形象，在原住民黑沉沉的意识深处，既是人也是兽。

语言自有其魔力：一个人，许多年来，在周围环境里，被喊作动物的名字，到最后，他习以为常，也认同了自己与这种动物的同一性，甚至感觉与之息息相关，有如一家人。当他返回欧洲时，让他诧异的是：再也没人把他与这种动物联系在一起了。

有一回，在伦敦动物园，我看到一位年老退休的政府官员，在非洲时，我只知道他是“博瓦纳·坦姆布”——大象先生。他独自站在大象馆面前，凝视着大象，陷入沉思。也许他经常去那儿。他的原住民仆人也会觉得他去那里是顺理成章的。但很可能，除了在那偶尔逗留几天的我，全伦敦再没有人会真的理解他。

原住民的思维模式很是奇怪，与旧时代的人一脉相通。古人们很自然地想象奥丁大神(3)是为了能一眼看透全世界，才交出他的另一只眼睛；他们视爱神为一个孩子(4)，对爱一无所知。就像农场上的基库尤人对身为法官的我敬若神明，而老实说，我对我据以判案的任何律法都全然无知。

因为他们的神话天赋，原住民会对你做出一些使你防不胜防且无法让自己置身事外的行为。他们能把你当作一个象征。对此过程，我了解得一清二楚，并且将其总结成自己用的专用词——在我心目中，我正在变成他们的“铜蛇”。与原住民长期相处过的欧洲人会明白我在说什么，既使这个词就《圣经》中它的本意来说，用得并不适当。我相信，无论我们在这块土地上开拓过何等事业，科学和机械方面如何兴盛发达，我们怎样拥有大不列颠强权下的和平，“铜蛇”(5)才是我们对原住民来说唯一实际的用处。

他们无法把所有白人都派上这用场，就是能用的，显然也不能有相同效果。在他们的世界里，根据可能成为“铜蛇”的程度，为我们按先后排序。我的许多朋友——丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿、加尔布雷思和伯克利·科尔二人、诺思劳普·麦克米兰爵士(6)——都在这个序列中名列前茅。

而德拉米尔勋爵(7)在铜蛇榜上高居榜首。我记得有一次，我在高原上旅行，正值可怕的蝗灾泛滥。去年，蝗虫来袭过一次，它们当时撒下的虫卵现在已经破土而出，田野里到处都是小小的黑色幼虫，大吃去年蝗虫过境时的残余，所过之处，不遗寸草片叶。对原住民来说，这是致命的打击，在去年的浩劫后，这一次已经严酷到无以承受了。他们的心碎了，唉声叹气，或者像濒死的狗一样哀嚎，死命把头撞向面前空气中那堵无形的墙。我偶尔向他们说起我曾开车经过德拉米尔的农场，看见到处都是蝗虫，牧场上草场上，遍地皆是。我补充道，德拉米尔对蝗灾暴跳如雷却又束手无策。我话音未落，听的人就安静下来，几乎立刻放轻松了。他们问我德拉米尔对他的不幸有何说法，反复追问，一再要我复述，之后就不再抱怨了。

同为铜蛇，我倒没有德拉米尔勋爵那么举足轻重，但我对原住民来说，有些场合下仍然颇有用处。

一战期间，整个运输部队的安危完全仰赖原住民社会，农场棚民们经常聚坐在大宅附近，不说话，彼此之间也不攀谈，只是眼巴巴看着我，把我当作铜蛇。我不能干脆把他们赶开，既然他们对我无害，另外就算轰走了，他们也会坐到别的地方去。真是让人难以忍受。我全靠一件事渡过难关，我弟弟的兵团当时被派往薇米岭的最前线。我可以把注意力都搁在他身上，认他为我的铜蛇。

每当大灾大难罹临农场，基库尤人都视我为丧家之人：首席哀悼者或者沉浸在悲痛中的妇人。枪击事故中，也是如此。我出面担当孩子们的不幸，农场中的其他人就可以将此事搁置一边，任时间过去而不闻不问。该如何处理这事端，他们全看我。就像圣会中的教徒，一起仰望神父代表他们饮尽杯中的圣酒。

这几近巫术，一旦曾在你身上施行，就几乎不可能挣脱它。我认为被吊死在绞刑架上(8)很痛苦，非常痛苦。我但愿我可以法外逃生。但是多年之后，某些状态下，你发现你在想：“我应该被如此对待吗？——我，曾经是铜蛇！”

我骑马返回农场，途中要穿过河流，马儿正在涉水，我遇到了卡尼努的几个儿子，三个年轻人和一个孩子。他们扛着长矛，排成一列，快步走来。我叫住他们，打听他们兄弟卡贝罗的消息。他们停住脚步，站在深及小腿的河水中，脸色凝重，眼帘低垂，声音很低沉。他们说，卡贝罗还没回来。自从他昨晚跑掉之后，还没人听到他的一点儿消息。大家现在断定他已经死了。可能是因绝望而自杀——对所有原住民来说，自杀的念头都很普遍，甚至包括儿童——也可能是在灌木丛中迷路，被野兽吃了。兄弟们已经分头去各个方向搜寻他了，他们现在出发去野生动物保护区，试试看能不能发现他的下落。

骑到我这边的河岸后，我转身眺望旷野：我这边的地势要高过保护区。原野上，一无生命的迹象，除了很远的地方，斑马在吃草奔驰。搜索小分队的身影从河对岸的灌木丛中浮现出来，他们走得很急，一个跟着一个。这小小的队列，像草丛中疾速爬过的短短毛毛虫，轨迹曲曲折折。阳光在他们的武器上闪烁着。他们好像对前进的方向很有把握，但要去哪里找呢？搜索走失小孩的过程中，唯一的向导将是秃鹫。旷野间，它们总在尸体的上方盘旋，总能告诉你，狮子猎杀猎物的准确地点在哪里。

而这将只是一具很小的胴体，尚不足以成为这些空中饕餮的大餐，不会有很多秃鹫恰好在场，而它们也不会停留很长时间。

想起这些，满心忧伤。我策马回家。

瓦麦


我在法拉陪同下出席长老会议。处理与基库尤人有关的事宜时，我也多半会带上法拉。当纠纷涉及他本人，他表现得很不理性；而一旦部落感情和种族间的宿仇加进来，他会像所有索马里人一样，完全丧失判断力。但应对其他人之间的争执时，他却相当明智，判断力极佳。除此之外，他还要担任我的翻译，因为他的斯瓦希里语讲得很好。

我到会之前就已经知道，会议的首要任务其实就是尽可能狠地刮卡尼努的油。他将眼睁睁看着自己的羊群被赶得四分五裂，一些用来赔偿死伤儿童的家属，另一些用来支付长老会议的开销。从一开始，我就不赞同这么做。我认为卡尼努和其他父亲一样，也失去了他的儿子，而且在我看来，他儿子的厄运，是这一悲剧中最惨的一环。瓦麦死了，一了百了；万扬格里在医院，有人照料；但卡贝罗，被所有人遗弃，无人知晓他埋骨何处。

此刻，卡尼努特别逼真地扮演着“肥牛”角色——养肥了待宰待变成盛宴的肥牛。在我的棚民名单上，他是最富裕的一员，名下有三十五头牛、五位妻子和六十只山羊。他的村子就在我的树林旁，所以我见过他的很多小孩和山羊，也经常撞见他的女人在砍伐我的大树。基库尤人不懂何为奢侈，他们中最有钱的人也生活得像个穷光蛋，如果走进卡尼努的棚屋，会发现那里几无一物能被称为家具，只有个木头小板凳是用来坐的。但卡尼努的村落里有不少棚屋，棚屋周围聚满了老太太、年轻人和孩子们，整天热热闹闹。日落挤奶时分，牛群排成长队，穿过草原，走向村落，在它们身后，淡蓝的影子随意地洒落在草地上。所有这一切，都给这位身披皮大氅、黝黑精明、脸上布满细纹的瘦老头儿笼上了老式富农的光环。

我与卡尼努多次吵得不可开交，我确实一直威胁要把他踢出农场，这全是因为他那特别的交易。卡尼努与相邻的马赛族相处融洽，嫁了四五个女儿给他们。基库尤人亲口告诉我，过去，马赛人认为与基库尤人通婚是自降身份。但是如今时日，这个奇特的、濒临灭绝的种族，为了推迟自己的覆亡，不得不放下身段，马赛族妇女不生孩子，部落急需能生会养的基库尤年轻女子。卡尼努的孩子们个个貌美，他用年轻的女儿们从马赛人居留区牵回很多油光水滑、活蹦乱跳的小母牛。那段时间，不止一位基库尤老父亲以相同的途径让自己发家致富。有人告诉我，基库尤大酋长基南朱伊就曾经将二十多个女儿送给马赛人，从他们那里换回一百多头牛。

不过，一年前，马赛人居留区因口蹄疫被隔离，牲畜不得带出隔离区。这使得卡尼努陷于窘境，前途黯淡。因为马赛人是游牧民族，随季节、雨水和牧草情况迁徒，四野为家，他们牧群里的牛，法律上属于卡尼努，客观上却被驱赶着横穿这片大地，在一两百千米之外，会在它们身上发生什么事，只有天晓得。马赛人与任何人做牲畜交易都是最不择手段的，尤其是跟他们看不起的基库尤人。马赛人都是能征惯战的勇士，据说也都是出色的爱人。在他们的掌握下，卡尼努女儿们的心像古代萨宾妇人的心一样，渐渐地变了，娘家人再也指望不上她们(1)。因此这位足智多谋的基库尤老人，在夜里，估计地区长官和兽医部的人都睡了，把自己的牛运出来，在我的农场上饮水。他这种行为是彻头彻尾的卑劣无耻，因为隔离区的有关规定，原住民全知道，也都赞成。一旦这些牛在我的农场被发现，农场也会被隔离。我于是派出警卫在河边巡逻，捉拿卡尼努的手下。月光明亮的晚上，在银色的河流边，曾发生多次戏剧化的伏击，还有过几次短兵相接，而小母牛们——它们才是各方面关注的核心，被惊得乱踢乱踏，四散飞奔。

丧生孩子瓦麦的父亲乔戈纳，则完全相反，家境贫困。他有且只有一位年老的妻子，这世上他唯一的财产，不过是三头山羊。他不太可能有更多钱了，因为他是一个头脑非常简单的人。我与乔戈纳很熟。事故发生前一年，也就是长老会议召开前一年，农场上发生了一起可怕的谋杀。两个印度人从我手里租下一间磨坊，就在离这里不远处的河上游，为基库尤人磨玉米。有一晚印度人被劫杀了，财物被抢劫一空，凶手始终不曾找到。这起谋杀把本地区所有印度商人和店员都吓跑了，仿佛他们是争先恐后从风暴中逃生。为了让我自家加工厂里的普莱·辛格留下来，我送他一把旧猎枪，把他全副武装起来，即使这样，也颇费了番口舌说服他。谋杀后的几个晚上，我也下意识觉得听到了房子周边的脚步声，为此，有一个星期之久，我在那里安排了一位夜间守卫，而这个守卫就是乔戈纳。他性子温吞，面对凶犯只怕一无用处，但他是一个和善的老人，和他说话挺让人心情舒爽。他天生就是一个活泼孩子的做派，扁平脸孔总是朝气蓬勃，热情洋溢，无论何时看到我，都笑得兴高采烈。此刻在长老会议上看到我，他好像也很高兴。

但《古兰经》——那段日子我正在研读——如是说：“汝不得为了顾念穷人的利益而扭曲法律正义。”

除我之外，会场上至少还有一个人清楚地意识到：这次集会的目的就是为了剥卡尼努的皮。那正是卡尼努本人。其他老人坐成一圈，全神贯注，为了会议的进程绞尽脑汁。而卡尼努坐在地面上，用他的黑羊皮斗篷蒙住头，不时在斗篷下发出一两声呜咽或哀鸣，像一只已经嚎得精疲力竭的狗，借此苟延残喘。

老人们想从受伤的孩子万扬格里开始，因为这能提供给他们机会无休无止地空谈。万一万扬格里死了，该有多少赔偿？如果他毁容了？假设他丧失了语言功能？法拉以我的名义通知他们：我不打算讨论这件事，直到我去内罗毕见过医院的医生之后。他们咽下失望，转向已经准备好的下一个议题。

我通过法拉转告长老会议，应该速战速决，不该把余生都耗在这儿谈论它。很明显这不是一桩谋杀案，只是一场不幸的意外。

为了给我个面子，我的高谈阔论长老们一个个洗耳恭听。但我话音刚落，他们立刻表示反对。

“姆萨布，我们都是不明事理的人，”他们说，“但这件事上，我们觉得，您的道理也不通。您对我们说的话，我们只懂得一句半句。总之，是卡尼努的儿子开的枪。否则为什么他是现场唯一没受伤的那个？如果您想兼听则明，莫格的儿子当时也在场，而且有一只耳朵被打掉了，他会告诉您。”

莫格也是一位富有的棚民，在农场上几乎与卡尼努旗鼓相当。他看上去性格稳重，语速颇慢，还不时停下来思索一下，但他的每一句话都很有分量。“姆萨布，”他说，“我儿子告诉我：孩子们一个接一个，全拿那杆枪瞄准过卡贝罗，但他没告诉他们怎么射击，不，他根本就不肯说。最后，他把枪拿回去，这时，枪响了，所有孩子都受了伤，瓦麦——乔戈纳的儿子，死了。当时的实情就是这样。”

“这些我全知道，”我说，“这就是大家说的坏运气，或者说事故。我可能在我宅子开枪走火，也可能是你，莫格，在你的宅子里。”

这句话在长老们中间引发了一场骚动。他们全看向莫格，后者被看得手足无措。随后，长老们之间交头接耳了一阵，说得很慢，全是窃窃私语。然后他们又和我争辩起来。“姆萨布，”他们说，“这次您说的话，我们是一个字都听不懂了。我们只能以为您说的是步枪。因为您用步枪高明得很，而猎枪不怎么样。如果这是一支步枪，您可能说得在理。但没人能用猎枪，在你的宅子，或者莫格的宅子里，甚至下面莫南亚先生的宅子里，打死人。”

稍待片刻后，我说：“现在人人都知道是卡尼努的儿子开的枪。卡尼努会赔给乔戈纳一些绵羊以弥补他的损失。但是大家也都知道卡尼努的儿子不是个坏孩子，不是有意要杀害瓦麦，所以卡尼努的赔偿数量不应该像故意杀人那么多。”

一位名叫阿瓦鲁的老者开了口。和其他人比起来，他和文明算是亲密接触过，因为他有过七年的狱中生涯。

“姆萨布，”他说，“你说卡尼努的孩子不是坏人，所以卡尼努不用赔很多羊。可是假设他儿子是故意杀害瓦麦，他就是个十恶不赦的坏小孩，那对卡尼努来说，会是个好事吗？难道他会为之高兴，愿意赔更多的羊？”

“阿瓦鲁，”我说，“你知道卡尼努失去了他的儿子。你自己也上过学，所以你知道这个孩子学习方面很聪明。如果他其他方面也这么出色，对于卡尼努来说，失去他是非常糟糕的事。”

漫长的沉默，会场上一丝动静也无。这沉默的尽头，是卡尼努，仿佛突然间忆起遗忘的痛楚或责任，发出了长长的一声哀嚎。

“姆萨比，”法拉用斯瓦希语对我说，为了保证老人们都能听懂他的意思，“让这些基库尤人说出他们心里的数字吧。”立刻，老人们都忸怩不安起来，因为“数字”是个具体事物，没有一个原住民乐意亲口说出。法拉抬眼轻蔑地环顾全场，提议：“一百头。”一百头绵羊是个骇人听闻的数目，没人会当真。长老们一片死寂。老人们自觉受到了索马里人的摆布，却只得低眉顺眼承受着。一位耄耋老人嗫嚅了一声“五十”，但这个数字仿佛一丝分量也无，被法拉玩笑的气浪直接吹上了天。

停了停，法拉直截了当地说：“四十。”完全是一种资深牲口贩子的做派，家有万贯，财大气粗。这一字眼令此次会议隐而未现的主题浮出水面。老人们有声有色地讨论起来。他们现在需要时间，好沉思苦想并喋喋不休，但总之，谈判的基调已经奠定。我们到家时，法拉肯定地对我说：“我认为，那些老人会从卡尼努手里拿走四十头绵羊。”

在长老会议上，卡尼努还有一个难关要过。大腹便便的老卡瑟古是农场里另一位富农，一个庞大家族的父亲与祖父，此刻站起身，提议要检查卡尼努交出来的每一只山羊和绵羊，一一过手，挨个儿挑选。这可跟任何一次长老会议的惯例都背道而驰，乔戈纳绝对想不出这高招，我只能相信：这必定是卡瑟古与乔戈纳之间私下交易的结果，因为这对卡瑟古有利。我于是静观其变，想看下文如何。

刚开始，卡尼努仿佛已经决定引颈待斩，头控得深深的，低低地啜泣着。每一头被点到名的牧畜，都像他活生生被拔下的一颗牙齿。到了最后，卡瑟古犹犹豫豫地要点一只无角大黄山羊，卡尼努的心都碎了，全身力量耗尽。他一跃而起，跃出斗篷，激烈地比手画脚。有那么一会儿，他像一头公牛般对我狂喊，嘶吼求助，那是一种从绝望深渊处最骇人的哭求。我与他一对眼神，他随即发现，我是站在他那边的，他的黄山羊是不会被抢走的。他不再吭声，坐了下来。只是过了几秒钟后，他向卡瑟古狠狠地看了一眼，眼光非常毒辣。

长老会议以及私下的小会开了一星期，终于定下来，由卡尼努赔偿给乔戈纳四十头绵羊，但没有指明具体是哪些被移交。

两星期后的一个晚上，我正在吃晚饭，法拉给了我关于这个案子的最新消息。

他告诉我，三位来自涅里的老人在前一天到了农场。他们在自家的棚屋里听说了这件事，便风尘仆仆地赶过来，声称瓦麦不是乔戈纳的儿子，而是他们已故兄弟的儿子，所以死亡赔偿金依法应给予他们。

我对这厚颜无耻付之一笑，对法拉点评道：这还真像涅里的基库尤人的行径。不，法拉推敲再三后，回答我：他想他们说的是实话。乔戈纳确实是六年前从涅里搬到农场来的，从法拉收集的消息来看，瓦麦的确不是乔戈纳的儿子，法拉说：“从来没是过。”他继续说，对乔戈纳来说，真是运气好得不得了，因为就在两天前，那四十头归他的羊里有二十五头被交到了他手里。否则，法拉说，卡尼努会把它们全送到涅里去，就为了眼不见心不烦，省得在农场上跟这些不再属于自己的羊抬头不见低头见。不过乔戈纳还得保持警惕，因为涅里的基库尤人可不是那么好打发的。他们已经在农场上安顿下来，并且威胁要把案子递到地区长官面前。

既然如此，我便做好准备，几天之后要在大宅门前会会这几位涅里人。他们属于基库尤人中的低等阶级，像三只脏兮兮、蓬头垢面的老鬣狗，追随着瓦麦的血迹，从两百四十千米外偷偷摸摸杀奔过来。乔戈纳是和他们一起出现的，极其焦躁不安，神情沮丧。他们态度的迥异很可能基于这个事实：涅里的基库尤人一无所有，没有什么可失去的；而乔戈纳有二十五头羊。我对他们的讼由毫不认同，毕竟不管情况如何，当这个孩子活着的时候，他们不曾对他略表过关心。而我很同情乔戈纳，他在长老会议上表现得很得体，并且我深信，他为瓦麦伤心不已。当我问起时，乔戈纳颤抖悲泣得那么厉害，他说的话，我一个字都听不懂，因此我们无法当场深入下去。

两天后，乔戈纳在黎明破晓时分又来了。当时我正好坐在打字机前。他口述他与死去的孩子及其生身家庭的关系，请我帮他笔录下来，想将这份报告呈给达戈莱蒂的地区长官。乔戈纳的简单朴实很打动人，对这些事他感触强烈，一丝遮掩也没有。很明显，他目前的所作所为，连他自己都觉得是惊人之举，并且不无风险；但他还是怀着惧意上路了。

我花了很长时间，才把他说的话都记下来。因为这是一篇冗长的报告，里面提到的事件前后跨度超过六年，而且盘根错节。在他口述的过程中，乔戈纳本人也经常不得不中断陈述，反复回想，或者回到开头重新组织词句。绝大多数时间里，他都是用双手抱着头，时不时还重重地拍拍头顶，仿佛要把事情真相从头壳里面震出来。有一次，他还走到墙边，把脸紧抵在墙上，这是基库尤妇女在分娩时会做的举动。

我留存了一份文件副本，收藏至今。

记录他的口述相当困难，因为里面包括了大量混淆不清的事件以及离题万里的细节。如果乔戈纳想不起来，我不会吃惊，令我诧异的是，他居然能原原本本把事情全记起来。报告是这样开头的：

“那时，涅里的瓦韦鲁·瓦麦，那塔卡库法（快死了）——用斯瓦希里语来说，就是‘起了死心’——他有两个老婆。一个老婆有三个女儿，瓦韦鲁死后，她就改嫁了。另一个老婆，她的聘礼瓦韦鲁还没有付清，他还欠岳父两头山羊的身价钱。这个老婆在举一捆木柴的时候，用劲太猛，流产了。没人知道她还能不能生出孩子来……”

报告就这样往前走，把读者拉进了基库尤人际遇及人际关系的重重迷雾里：

“这个老婆有个儿子，取名瓦麦。当时正在生病，大家相信他是出天花。瓦韦鲁很爱他的老婆和这个小孩。他快死了，他非常担心，不知道自己死掉之后，他们会怎么样。他于是出发去找他的朋友乔戈纳·坎亚戛，这个朋友正好住得不算远。当时，乔戈纳·坎亚戛因为一双鞋欠瓦韦鲁三先令。现在瓦韦鲁跟他建议，说他们可以立个约……”

约定是这样的：乔戈纳接手他将亡朋友的妻小，付给她父亲两头山羊，这是她身价钱的余额，应该归老人家。从这一步起，报告变成开销清单，列出了乔戈纳收养孤儿瓦麦之后的一笔笔花费。他郑重说明，才刚把瓦麦带回家，就为病中的瓦麦买了灵丹妙药。瓦麦吃玉米长得不甚茁壮，有时他还会为瓦麦从印度老爷们手里买大米。有一回，他不得不付给邻近的白人农场主五个卢比，因为后者说瓦麦把自家的一只火鸡撵进了池塘。想必凑齐最后一笔现金很不容易，因此这在乔戈纳的脑海中留下了深刻的烙印。他反复说起此事。从乔戈纳的表现来看，从那时起，他已经忘掉了这个他目前痛失的爱子并非亲骨肉。在诸多方面，三个涅里人的到来和他们的要求都令他心烦意乱。头脑简单的人似乎有一种收养儿童的天性，细心呵护，视若亲生；心地厚道的欧洲农人们也能做到这一点，不费吹灰之力。

乔戈纳终于说到了故事的终点，而我也全记下来了，我告诉他我现在就念给他听。我开口的时候，他转脸不肯看我，仿佛要避免一切可能的注意力不集中。

但当我念出他的本名：“他于是出发去找他的朋友乔戈纳·坎亚戛，这个朋友正好住得不算远。”他倏地转过头来，双目灼灼、极热切地看向我，笑容满脸，一下子把这个老人变成了个小孩，呈现出青春独特的标志。当我读完文件，再次念出他的名字——签在指纹下方，用以验明正身，那燃烧的直视眼神又浮现在他眼中，这一次更深刻也更平和，带着一种全新的骄傲。

这是亚当曾有的眼神，那时上帝用土抟造出他，向他的鼻孔里吹进生命的气息，令这个躯体拥有了活生生的灵魂。今天，我创造了他，并且让他看到了自己：穷尽一生，他都是乔戈纳·坎亚戛。我把报告递给他，他毕恭毕敬又急不可耐地接过去，折起来，藏在斗篷一角，用手一直按着。他万万承受不了可能的丢失，因为那是他灵魂的栖身处，他存在的证明。这里有一些事，是乔戈纳·坎亚戛完成的，将令他的名字永世流传：骨肉之情凝成文字，满怀着尊严与真诚，在人与人之间万古长驻。

我在非洲那几年，正值文字世界向非洲原住民渐渐开启。那时，如果我愿意，是可以抓住过往的尾巴，并在我们自己的历史上占据一席之地的：过去欧洲大部分老百姓，就是用同样的方式保存收到的书信。在丹麦，这发生在数百年之前，当我还是个小孩的时候，从那些非常高寿的老人讲的故事来看，我深信，收信者与发信者的反应几乎完全一致。而对于“为艺术而艺术”的金科玉律，人类鲜会展现出如此谦卑又如此狂热的痴情。

年轻的原住民与其他人的通信，一般来说，还是由职业代笔人完成，因为虽然一些老人被时代精神感染，还有小部分年事已高的基库尤人来我的学校，不厌其烦地在ABC上苦下功夫，但绝大多数老一代对文字这种稀罕玩意儿心存疑虑，敬而远之。只有很少原住民能读，所以我的仆人们、农场上的棚民和雇工都会把收到的书信带给我，让我给他们念出来。一封又一封，我展读信件，仔细端详，为内文里千篇一律的废话而感到莫名其妙。这是心怀成见的文明人经常犯的错误。你也会动身前往天涯海角，采集挪亚之鸽曾带回家的一小茎橄榄枝。无论它看上去是什么样子，都比装满动物的整个方舟负着更沉重的分量，那是一叶一天堂，承载了绿色的美丽新世界。

原住民之间的通信基本上大同小异，都是以同一个神圣的标准样本为模子，或多或少类似下文：“我亲爱的朋友卡茂·莫夫尔。我现在持笔在手”——语气夸张，因为写信的是专业代笔人。“给你写信，因为我长久以来就想写信给你。我一切都好，希望你也仰仗天恩，万事如意。我母亲很好。我的妻子不太好。但我祝尊夫人托天之福，玉体康健。”——此处将列出一长串名字，其中每人的情况都会简略地报告一下，大部分都无关紧要，偶尔还有些属于异想天开。然后信就到了尾声。“现在我的朋友卡茂，我不得不草草收尾，因为我几乎抽不出时间给你写信。你的朋友恩德韦蒂·劳里。”

而一百年前，在欧洲，为了在满怀热忱的青年人之间传递类似的信息，驭手们飞身跨上马鞍，纵马疾驰，邮车吹响号角，镶着舌状金边的信纸被批量制造。这些信，被欢迎，被珍视，被收藏。我自己就见过好些。

在我学会斯瓦希里语之前，我与原住民书信世界的关系相当奇妙：我能为他们读信，但完全不知道自己读了什么。斯瓦希里语原本只是口头语言，没有书面文字，直到白人主动为他们发明了文字。斯瓦希里文纯粹是按发音拼写而成的，完全没有会令朗读者上当的传统拼字法则。那时，我会坐下来，逐字逐句、字正腔圆地念出他们收到的信，他们则屏息静气簇拥在我身边，满怀期待。信中所涉及的内容，我全不知晓，却能留意到他们对我所读内容的反应。有时候，听我读信，他们会失声痛哭，或者用力拧手，还有些时候，他们会喜极而泣；但对这些千篇一律、经文般无聊的书信，最常见的反应是欢笑，我念信的时候，他们常常狂笑不已，前仰后合。

后来，当我终于能懂得我读的内容时，我领悟到，一条书面上的消息，其效力将被放大许多许多倍。信息通过口头传达，听者往往半信半疑，很是藐视——因为所有的原住民都是彻头彻尾的怀疑论者——而一旦诉之于笔墨，则马上被视为颠扑不破的真理。同样，原住民对于讲话中用混的字词特别耳利；这类错误能带给他们幸灾乐祸的巨大快感，而且他们永远不会忘。当一个白人一时口误，他们一辈子都会用这个口误称呼他；但，当白纸黑字出了错——其实这个司空见惯，因为代笔人都是不学无术的人——他们却总是坚持这是有意为之，把它解释成某一用意。他们会反复思量，争来论去，但他们永远认定：最荒唐的事，莫过于在写出来的文字寻找错谬。

在一封我给一位农场少年念的信里，写信人，夹在各种杂七杂八的消息里，简单地写了一句：“我煮了一只狒狒。”我认为这一定是说他“捕”了一只狒狒，因为在斯瓦里希语中，这两个字发音很相近。但是收信人对此并不同意。

“不，姆萨布，不是，”他说，“他在信里怎么写的？写下来的是什么？”

“他确实写了，”我说，“他煮了一只狒狒，但他怎么可能煮狒狒呢？如果他真这么干了，他应该会写得详细一点儿，告诉你他为什么要煮狒狒，还有怎么煮的。”

对福音书般牢不可摧的文字大肆讥评，令这基库尤小伙子非常难受。他要回他的信，小心翼翼折叠起来，揣着信走开了。

说到我为乔戈纳写下的书面材料，事实证明那是有力凭证，地区长官读过之后，驳回了涅里人的诉求，他们只好闷闷不乐地回老家去了，双手空空，在农场上一无所获。

这份文件成为乔戈纳最宝贵的财富。我不止一次看到它。乔戈纳为它打造了一个小皮包，饰以珠绣，用皮条拴着，挂在自己脖子上。经常的，大部分是在星期日早晨，他会蓦地出现在门口，打开皮包，拿出那张纸，请我为他朗读。有一次我病后初愈，第一次能够骑马外出时，他远远瞥见，立刻发足狂追了我很远一段路，站在我的马旁边，气都喘不过来地把文件递给我。每一次朗读时，他的脸上都现出同一份深深的胜利狂喜，等我读完，他会精心抚平纸张，折好后放入皮包。这份流水账的重要性，不曾随时间递减，反而与日俱增，仿佛对乔戈纳来说，最神奇之处乃在于它竟会一成不变。过去如此难以回忆，而且很可能每次想起都改变，而此刻，它被捕获，被征服，就在他双眼之间被钉牢了。它已经成为了历史；而历史“并没有改变，也没有转动的影儿”(2)。

万扬格里


每当上内罗毕的时候，我都去原住民医院探望一下万扬格里。

我的土地上住着这么多家棚民，使我几乎无时无刻不在医院住着位病人，我是病房常客，与护士长和护工们都关系融洽。我从没见过谁比护士长脂粉打得更厚。洁白的护士帽下，她宽阔的大脸，看去像俄罗斯木娃娃，就是以“俄罗斯套娃”之名售卖的那种，你可以拧开它，取出里面的一个小号娃娃，而小号娃娃里面还藏着一个更小的。她是个和蔼能干的护士长，就像你觉得俄罗斯套娃会表现出来的那样。医院每星期四会把病床搬出来，放置在病房之间的开阔处，方便打扫病房且换新鲜空气。这是医院里最愉快的一天。从庭院里看出去，景色极佳，前方是干枯的阿西河(1)平原，远处是多尼约萨布克山和木阿山脉的青山翠谷。我农场上那些基库尤老妇人盖着白床单躺在床上的场面，是很让人发噱的，她们在那儿看上去像精疲力竭的老骡马，或者其他生病的驮兽。看着我，她们自己也为这尴尬场面大笑不已，但是笑得很酸楚，就像真的老骡马一样，因为原住民很害怕医院。

我在医院里第一次见到万扬格里的时候，他魂飞魄散，全盘崩溃，我不禁想到：或许对他来说，最佳方案就是及时死去。他什么都害怕，我陪着他的时候，他一直在哭，乞求带他回农场。他全身在绷带里颤抖，哆哆嗦嗦。

一星期后我重来医院，发现他已经安定下来，精神饱满，神气活现地接见了我。但看到我，他还是很高兴的，护士告诉我，他等我出现，都快不耐烦了，因为今天他能和我说话了。通过一根插在他嘴里的管子，他语气坚定、一字一字地迸出要说的话：前天他死了一次，几天后还要再死一次。

万扬格里的主治医生，曾经在法国参战，修补过很多人的脸。在万扬格里身上，他很动了些心思，才终于大功告成。他在腭骨处放置了一条金属带，固定在脸部残余的其他骨头上，又取下被打烂的碎肌肉，将它们连在一起，为万扬格里制造了一个“准下巴”。万扬格里告诉我，医生甚至从他肩部取下一片皮肤，用以完成脸部的拼缝。治疗到达尾声，绷带去掉后，孩子的脸大变样了，因为没有下巴，看去很怪异，像一只蜥蜴的脸。但他能够用正常方式吃饭说话了，只是多少有些吐字不清。经历了好几个月才走到这一步。每次去看万扬格里，他都向我要糖吃，所以我习惯用小纸片包几匙糖带上。




除非被未知的恐惧彻底吓傻，原住民在医院里总是满腹怨言，咆哮吵闹，不住地想出阴谋诡计打算伺机逃走。死亡是固有之事，他们丝毫不惧。而欧洲人建造医院，完善设备，为他们治疗，还得费尽九牛二虎之力把病人们拖进去，于是总心酸地指责原住民们不懂感恩，全不考虑你为他们做了些什么。

原住民的这种思维模式让白人们伤透脑筋，满心憾恨。真的，不管你为他们做什么都一样；你可做之事很少很少，而且不管你做过什么，那些事都会消失不见，你再不会听谁提起；他们不感谢你，也不嫌恶你，哪怕你希望他们烦你恨你，你都无能为力。这一切表现令人生畏：仿佛宣布你不是一个有血有肉的人，硬把一个非你所愿的角色安在你头上，好像你只是一种自然现象，好像你不过就是天气一样的存在。

索马里移民在这方面与本土原住民截然不同。你对他们的所作所为影响甚深。事实上，你如果不以这种或那种方式打动这些来自沙漠、性如烈火、强悍好战且一丝不苟的人，那么，除非对他们造成重创，否则你寸步难行。对恩情，他们永世不忘；同样，仇怨也会刻骨铭心。恩惠与挑衅或轻视一道，深深刻在他们心坎上。他们都是严格的穆斯林，像所有穆斯林一样，依据一套道德准则来判断你的行为。与索马里人在一起，你能在一小时内建立威望，也能用片刻时间就毁掉它。

在原住民种族中，马赛人的处世之道最为特别。他们记得你的好，他们感谢你——同时恨你。他们恨我们全体，这恨，只有等该种族消亡时，才会随之一扫而空吧。

但是，心无成见的基库尤人、乌卡巴人，或者卡维朗多人，不晓得什么法典，时常觉得绝大多数人都有通天彻地之能，所以，如果你想让他们震惊，多半做不到。只能说，对一个穷苦的或心理扭曲的基库尤人来说，无论你如何对待他们，都没什么差别。出于天性以及该民族的传统，他们观察我们的行径，一如观察大自然。他们绝不说长道短，但都是火眼金睛，这观察结果汇总在一起，就是你留在他们中的形象，你的美名或者恶名。

从这个意义上来说，欧洲的赤贫者与基库尤人是相似的。他们对你不予置评，却把一切加在一起衡量。如果他们喜欢你或者敬慕你，则爱戴你如信徒对天神。不管你对他们意欲何为，不管你到底对他们做过什么，只取决于你是什么样的人。

一天我在医院闲荡的时候，看到三个新来的病人，其中一个大人皮肤漆黑，生了一颗毛发厚重的大头，另外是两个少年，三人都在喉咙处包扎着绷带。有一位驼背护士是个话痨，很乐意跟我绘声绘色描述他负责的病区里那些耸人听闻的病例。看到我站在新来者的床前，他走了过来，把他们的故事说给我听。

他们都是努比亚人(2)，在英皇非洲步枪队军乐团当乐手。两个少年是鼓手，大人是号手。号手一辈子经常惹是生非，与人起纠纷，而且就像通常原住民一样，一冲动就失去理智。这一次，他首次对着营房开枪，左右横扫，弹匣打空后，就把自己和这两个少年一起锁在他那座波纹钢的小屋里，砍了那两个人的喉咙，又砍自己的。护士很遗憾我没亲眼目睹他们上星期被送进来时满身鲜血的样子，我如果在现场，会认定他们早就死翘翘了。他们三人现已脱离险情，凶手也恢复了理智。

说故事的人一路说下去，三位躺在床上的当事人全听得聚精会神，还不时打断他，纠正一些细节。两个说话还很吃力的少年，每每把头转向他们中间的床位，让凶手本人确认他们的叙述，信心满满地认定他会帮忙，令我尽可能把故事的始末知道得清清楚楚。

“你有没有口吐白沫？你有没有大喊大叫？”他们问他，“你有没有说，你要把我们碎尸万段，碎成蝗虫那么大？”

杀人犯连连应道：“有的，有的。”表情沉痛。

那段日子，我不时在内罗毕待个半天，等待商务会谈，或者等一辆来自海边的晚点邮车送来欧洲来信。这种时候，我无事可做，便开车到原住民医院，带上几个康复阶段的病人，乘车出去兜一个愉快的风。万扬格里住院的时候，正值总督爱德华·诺西勋爵养了两只幼狮，打算送给伦敦动物园，当时关在总督府庭院中的大笼子里。这对狮子对病人们来说有巨大吸引力，他们全都求我带他们看。我答应英皇非洲步枪队军乐团的病人们，他们身体够好就带他们去，但得等三个人全康复，否则谁也去不成。号手是最后一个复原的，结果一个少年还没来得及看狮子就已经出院了，他每天都回医院探问号手的情况，以确定会带上他。有一天我在门外遇到了少年，少年告诉我，号手仍然头疼得很厉害，但这是可想而知的，因为他的脑袋曾经有恶魔装得满满的。

最后他们三个人全来了，站在笼子前面久久观望。一头幼狮被这长久的瞪视激怒，蓦地拔身而起，伸直腰身，发出一声短促的狮吼，围观者们都被震骇了，最年轻的少年躲到号手背后。我们开车回去的路上，他对号手说：“那狮子跟你以前一样凶。”

这期间，农场上万扬格里的案子一直悬而未决。他的家人有时来问我他进展如何，但是除了他弟弟之外，他们好像都害怕去探望他。卡尼努在夜深时分在我屋子周围徘徊，像一只出洞四处探访的老獾似的，向我刺探这孩子的消息。法拉与我两人在私下里多次掂量他将有的损失，换算成羊只。

事故后一两个月，法拉又告知了我案情的新进展。

一般是在我吃饭的时候，他走进来，在桌子一端立得笔直，担起把我从昏蒙状态里拉出来的重任。法拉英文法文俱佳，但会犯某些特定的错误，一直改不了口。在该说“除了”的时候，他会说“除非”，“所有的牛都回家了，除非那头灰牛”——我并没有纠正他，恰恰相反，在我与他说话时，也会用同样的表达方式。他的面容，他的表情，一样庄严肯定，但每次开口，向来都说得模模糊糊。“姆萨比，”他说，“卡贝罗。”那么这就是主题了。我等着听下文。

稍停片刻后，法拉重新开了头：“姆萨比，您觉得，”他说，“卡贝罗死了，早被鬣狗吃了。他没死。他和马赛人在一起。”

我半信半疑地问他何以得知。“哦，我知道，”他说，“卡尼努有太多女儿嫁给马赛人了。当时卡贝罗觉得除非马赛人，没人能救他，就跑到姐夫那里去了。实打实地说，有一阵他很吃了些苦头：整晚坐在树上，鬣狗就在树下站了一圈。现在他和马赛人生活在一起。有位富有的马赛老人，有好几百头牛，无儿无女，打算收养卡贝罗。这件事，自头至尾，卡尼努都知道得一清二楚，还很多次出外与马赛人谈判此事。但他不敢告诉你，他相信一旦白人晓得，卡尼努会在内罗毕会绞死。”

谈起基库尤人，法拉的口气总是很傲慢。“马赛妇人们，”他说，“生不出孩子来。(3)能收养基库尤小孩，她们高兴坏了。她们偷了太多基库尤小孩。这个卡贝罗，”他说下去，“长大后会回到农场的。他不会愿意像马赛人那样生活，总是从一个地方赶往另一个地方。基库尤人都是懒骨头，可做不到。”

与农场隔河相望的马赛族正在日益衰亡，他们的悲剧命运，一年一年，有迹可循。他们是战士，但被禁止战斗；他们是垂死的狮，爪牙已经被剪除；他们是被阉割的民族。矛从他们身边被拿走，甚至他们华丽硕大的盾也一样。在野生动物保护区里，狮群跟着他们的牛群，伺机待捕。有一次，在农场上，我阉了三头年轻的公牛，打算把它们变成温顺的阉牛，用来犁地拉车。入夜，鬣狗嗅到血的味道，过来把它们全给咬死了。我觉得，这就是马赛人的命运。

“卡尼努的老婆，”法拉说，“为失去儿子悲伤了很多年。”

我没有派人去叫卡尼努，因为我不知道该不该相信法拉跟我说的话。不过，当卡尼努再次来到大宅时，我出来跟他说话。“卡尼努，”我问他，“卡贝罗还活着吗？他是和马赛人在一起吗？”你永远不会发现一个原住民对你的任何行为感觉措手不及，卡尼努立刻开始为他不见了的孩子痛哭失声。我听着他的哭喊，凝视着他。“卡尼努，”我又开了口，“把卡贝罗带到这里来。他不会被绞死的。他母亲可以把他留在身边，让他生活在农场上。”卡尼努没有停下恸哭来，但他一定听见了那个关于“绞死”的可怕字眼。他哭嚎得更厉害了，并且突然开始强调卡贝罗曾经说过的：他长大了要怎么样……而卡贝罗是他最百般偏爱的儿子，超过所有其他的儿女。

卡尼努儿孙众多，他的村子离我的大宅很近，所以这些孩子都在大宅周围出没。其中有一个是他的小外孙，母亲是卡尼努曾经远嫁到马赛居留区的女儿们之一，后来回了娘家，还带回了这个孩子。他叫斯朗加。他身上的混血令他展现奇特的生命力，无穷的奇思妙想、狂野的创造力，使他仿佛一个非人类的存在：一小团火焰，一只夜莺，一个农场小精灵。但他患有癫痫，因此其他的孩子很怕他，总把他从他们的游戏中赶开，而且叫他“史泰尼”——魔鬼——所以我收留了他给我当仆人。因为有病，他干不了活，但他在办公室里，极其出色地扮演着小丑或者傻瓜的形象，让我很开心。我走到哪里，他都跟到哪里，像一个我脚边滚来滚去的黑影子。卡尼努知道我对这孩子的怜爱，一直对此露出老祖父的慈祥笑容；现在他抓住这一点，尽力发挥其作用，对我下功夫。他大力宣称：他宁愿让斯朗加被鬣狗吃掉十次，也不愿失去卡贝罗，而现在，事实上他失去了卡贝罗，那就让斯朗加也去吧，无所谓——说到卡贝罗，卡贝罗就是他的掌中珍宝，是他的心头肉。

如果卡贝罗真的去世，这就是大卫王在悲叹他的儿子押沙龙(4)，一桩必须独自承受的悲剧。但假若卡贝罗还活着，躲在马赛人居留区，其实是更大的悲剧。或战或逃，都是在为一个孩子的生死存亡而挣扎。

在草原上我曾经目睹过瞪羚玩的把戏，当时我一无所知地经过它们的窝巢，而巢中有它们新生的幼崽。它们会在你面前一步之遥起舞、蹦跳、雀跃，或者假装跛脚而不能跑——只为了让你注意不到它们的孩子。突然间，几乎就在马蹄的正下方，你看到了幼崽，一动不能动，小小的脑袋从草丛中探了出来，为了保命，趴得低低的，它的母亲正为了掩护它在跳舞。一只鸟也会做同样的事，只为了保卫幼雏，拍翅，振翼，甚至巧妙地扮演伤鸟的形象，把“受伤”的翅膀拖到地面上。

此时此刻，想到儿子命在旦夕，卡尼努也在做着同样的表演。在这位年老的基库尤人身上，竟能有如此丰盛的温情、如此充分的做戏能力？在这番做作里，他的老骨头嘎嘎作响。他甚至改变了性别，呈现出一位老妪、一只母鸡、一头雌狮的姿态——这把戏，明明白白，就是母性的行为。他的表演滑稽荒谬，却也同时令人肃然起敬，像公鸵鸟与母鸵鸟轮流孵蛋一样值得尊敬。没有女人能在这般策略面前还不为所动，保持铁石心肠。

“卡尼努，”我对他说，“卡贝罗想回农场的时候，随时都可以，不会受到伤害。不过到时你一定要亲自把他带到我这里来。”卡尼努缄口不言，低下头，伤心地走开了，仿佛失去了这世上他最后一个朋友。




在这里，我得说明一下，卡尼努记住了我的话，而且照我说的做了。五年后，我几乎已经把整件事抛在脑后了，某一天，他通过法拉求见。我发现他站在屋外，重心全压在一只脚上，表面上还威风凛凛，其实心里七上八下。他赔着笑开口道：“卡贝罗回来了。”那时我已学会停顿的艺术，于是一言不发。这位基库尤老人感觉到沉默的压力，换了只脚受力，眼皮打起颤来。“我儿子卡贝罗回到农场上了。”他又说了一遍。我问：“他从马赛人那里回来的？”我肯开口这一事实，立刻被他视为我已经原宥了他。他还没有笑逐颜开，但脸上所有那些狡黠的细小皱纹全都抖了开来，随时欲笑。“是的，姆萨布，是的，他从马赛人那里回来了，”他说，“他回来为你效劳。”在这辗转的五年间，政府实施了人口登记制，对本国的每一位原住民都做了登记，所以我们现在必须请一位警官从内罗毕赶过来为卡贝罗注册，他才能成为农场上的合法住户。卡尼努和我约好了日子。

那一天，卡尼努和他儿子早早就来了，比警官早了很久。卡尼努高高兴兴把儿子带到我面前，但对这个失而复得的儿子，他心里还是有些许惊怕。这是情有可原的，因为马赛人从农场得到的是一只小羊羔，现在还回来的却是一只幼豹。卡贝罗的身上一定有马赛血统，否则马赛人的习俗和戒律总不会自行在陌生人身上发生质变，落地生根吧。他挺立着，从头到脚都是完完全全的马赛人。

马赛战士都是英俊少年。这些年轻男子有一种被我们称为潇洒的聪明灵巧，且将之发挥得淋漓尽致——勇敢无畏，有与外表相匹配的奇思妙想，忠于自我，忠于内在的理想，且坚定不移。他们的风采并非装腔作势，也不是对外界美好的效仿，而是自内生发的，是血统与历史的再现。他们手中的武器、他们身上的华服，是他们身上重要的一部分，正如鹿角之于牡鹿。

卡贝罗的发型是马赛式的，长发用细绳结成粗辫，一条皮带环过他的额头。他已经习惯了马赛人的姿态，下巴向前高高扬起，仿佛将自己冷漠、傲慢的脸孔搁在托盘上，呈现给你。“磨难人”(5)惯有的严峻、凛冽和骄傲，他也同样具备，使他成为人们瞩目的中心，有如雕像，是被观看的对象，而从来不观看自身。

年轻的马赛战士们靠喝牛奶饮牛血生存，也许就是这样的食谱，令他们肤质如丝光滑，气色红润。他们的面孔，颧骨很高，腭骨的上下活动很明显，皮肤光洁，没有一丝皱纹或沟槽，很是饱满。暗暗的眼睛，深藏于眼窝中，像马赛克上镶嵌的两颗黑石。所有的马赛勇士与马赛克都有异曲同工之处。他们的颈部肌肉以一种怕人的线条高高隆起，像发怒的眼镜蛇、雄豹或斗牛的脖颈。显而易见，颈项的粗壮是男子气概的指征，代表了对全世界所有人所有事的宣战——女人除外。光润圆滑的脸，强壮的颈项，宽广浑圆的肩膀，与之形成鲜明对比，抑或反而是一种调和的，是他们纤细惊人的腰臀，精瘦的大腿与膝盖，长且笔直、肌腱发达的小腿，这一切令他们看去像一种以铁律训练出来的生物，打造的目的只为了掠夺、暴食及贪婪之用。

马赛人步态是僵硬的，每一只细瘦的脚都笔直地落在另一只脚前方，但他们手臂、腰及双手的动作却柔软灵活至极。当一个年轻的马赛人开弓射箭，松开弓弦的刹那，你仿佛听见他细巧腕部里的肌腱也与箭声一道，在空中鸣响。

内罗毕来的警官是个年轻人，最近才从英国本土过来，满腔工作热情。他的斯瓦希里语讲得实在太好，弄得我与卡尼努完全听不懂。他对这一桩蒙尘的枪击案很感兴趣，围绕这个跑进森林的基库尤人，对卡尼努进行了交叉盘问。问完话后，他告诉我，他觉得对卡尼努的处理很是荒唐，整桩案子应该提交到内罗毕去。“那就意味着，要浪费好几年你与我的时间。”我说。他恳请我注意，时间不值得考虑，重要的是伸张正义(6)。卡尼努看向我，有一瞬间以为自己被骗了。不过到最后，警官发现案子已经太老，不值得旧事重提，而且也没什么可处理的，除了把卡贝罗登记为农场常住人口之外。




这一切，都是很久之后才发生的。这五年里，相对农场来说，卡贝罗是亡灵，与马赛人一道浪迹天涯，而卡尼努还有八十一难要经历。案件了结之前，各方面都在向他施压，玩弄他，压榨他，践踏他，把他搓圆揉扁，捏得小小的。

关于这些，其实我说不了太详细。首先因为他们秘而不宣的天性，其次，当时我自己遇到了一些事，使我全无余力操心卡尼努与他的命运。在我脑海里，农场里的日常事务都成为浩瀚的背景，像遥不可及的乞力马扎罗雪山一样时隐时现，有时我能从农场里看到它的身影，有时看不到。原住民们只是默默地、温顺地，陪我度过这一段心烦意乱的日子，仿佛我真的飞离他们的时空，进入另一个平行宇宙。那之后，每当他们提起，就好像这段日子我不在家一样。“大树倒了，”他们说，“我的孩子死了，当你与白人们在一起的时候。”

万扬格里康复出院后，我带他回了农场。从那时起，我只在恩贡玛舞会上或者田野间偶尔遇到他。

他回家几天后，他的父亲万奈纳和他的祖母登门造访。万奈纳是个矮胖子，这在基库尤人里是很少见到的，基库尤人几乎全生得十分清瘦。他留了一撮稀疏的小胡子，另一个特征是：他从不直视你的脸，让人觉得他是个精神上的隐者，渴望离群索居。和他同来的，是他的母亲，一位基库尤老太太。

原住民妇人剃光头。奇怪的是，没过多久，你竟会感到，这小小的、光溜溜的圆脑袋，像枚黑坚果，是真正女人味的特征，女人顶上有毛，跟嘴上有毛一样，都不像个淑女。万奈纳老母亲皱缩的头皮上，残留着几绺白发，很像一个没刮胡子的男人，流露出一种大大咧咧、没羞没臊的气质。她倚着拐杖站着，一言不发，让万奈纳发言，而她的沉默火花四射。她好像周身都笼罩着一种粗犷的活力，却一点也没有让儿子继承到。他们两人其实是尤拉卡和拉斯卡拉(7)，不过这一点，我是后来才知道的。

他们在我家支吾良久，其实是为了一件和和气气的好事。万扬格里的父亲告诉我，万扬格里嚼不动玉米，他们是穷苦人家，一无面粉，二无奶牛。我能不能开恩，在万扬格里的案子了结前，用我的牛群赏他一些牛奶？否则，他们真不知道赔偿到来之前，拿什么养活这孩子。法拉出门去内罗毕处理一桩他本人的索马里法律纠纷了，他既然不在家，我就做主让万扬格里每天从我的牛群中拿一瓶非洲牛产的奶。我把这事交代给仆人们。对这一安排，仆人们好像很不情愿，甚至有些心神不宁。

两三星期过去了，一天晚上卡尼努忽然到访。当时我刚刚吃完晚饭，正在火炉边看书，他突然出现，站在屋里。原住民通常喜欢在外面说话，而他在身后关上门的神态，让我意识到这会是一次不寻常的谈话。让我最惊讶的是：卡尼努变成哑巴了。他那灵巧、惯说甘言媚词的舌头，死一般沉默，仿佛刚刚被人切断。卡尼努站得挺挺的，房里鸦雀无声。这位高大的基库尤老人显得非常衰弱，全靠拐杖撑着他的体重，斗篷里似乎已经没有身体的存在。他两眼无光有如死人，一直在用舌头舔自己干枯的双唇。

到最后他开口了，缓慢、沉郁，只是说：他觉得事情要糟了。过了一会儿，他莫名其妙地加了几句，仿佛这事无足轻重不值一提似的，说他已经赔了十多只山羊给万奈纳。他说下去：而现在，万奈纳，还跟他要一头带牛犊的母牛，他会给的。我问他为什么要这样做，裁决还没有做出呢。卡尼努没有回答，他甚至一眼都不看我。那晚，他是一位没有原乡的旅人或朝圣者。他走进来跟我说长道短，只因我家在他的必经之路上，现在他又要出发了。我只能认为他是病了，过了一会儿，我说，我明天会带他去医院。听到这个，他急促地、痛楚地看了我一眼：我在骗他，骗这么一个老骗子精。出门之前，他做了一件奇怪的事，他举手掩脸，仿佛擦去了一滴泪。这场面，就像朝圣者香杖上开出的花朵一样，令人目瞪口呆，想必卡尼努已经在窝棚里独自落过泪，而且他竟然还会徒劳无功地对陌生人下泪。我想知道，在我神游天外这段日子，农场上到底发生了什么。卡尼努走后，我派人找来法拉，向他问个究竟。

有时，法拉显得很不愿意谈及原住民事务，仿佛这些事不值得他耗精神，而对我也会有辱清听。到最后，他答应告诉我。他讲述的时候，眼神一直越过我，经过窗口，看向夜空的星辰：卡尼努心底的恐惧，归根结底来自万奈纳的母亲，她是个女巫，对他下了咒。

“但是，法拉，”我说，“老实说，卡尼努够老奸巨猾，不会相信咒语这回事。”

“不，”法拉慢慢地说，“不，姆萨比。这个基库尤老太太真的有这能力，我是这么觉得的。”

这个老妪曾经对卡尼努说：如果他一开始就把牛交给万奈纳，会好一些——否则，他的牛群就是明证。现在卡尼努的牛正在一头一头地瞎掉。在这样严峻的折磨下，卡尼努的心缓缓地碎了。就像古时代那些被施以酷刑的人，放置在他们身上的重量逐步增加，他们的骨头和肌肉一点点破裂。

法拉用一种既平淡又担忧的口吻说起基库尤巫术，就像说农场上发作了口蹄疫。这种疾病还不曾在农场上流行，但它一旦来临，我们必会损失牲口。

那一夜，我久久不能睡，坐到很晚，一直在考虑农场上的巫术问题。起初只觉得丑恶，仿佛它是从旧坟头里钻出来的，正把鼻子紧贴在我的窗玻璃上。我听见不远处，鬣狗在号叫，就在河的下游，蓦地想起，基库尤人也有自己的狼人传说，老妇人们会在夜里化为鬣狗之形。也许万奈纳的母亲此刻正在河边疾步前进，在夜风里龇着獠牙。此时，我接受了巫术的观念，它仿佛是一桩理所当然的事。非洲之夜，太多事都玄妙难测。

“这个老太太真不要脸，”我用斯瓦希里语想，“她利用巫术弄瞎了卡尼努的牛，还让我养她的孙子，每天从我这里拿一瓶奶。”

我暗自思忖：“这起事故，以及从事故生发出来的其他事端，正在腐蚀农场的元气，这是我的错。我必须召唤生力军，否则农场将堕入噩梦，陷入恐怖梦魇。我知道该怎么做。我要派人去请吉南朱伊。”

一位基库尤酋长


大酋长吉南朱伊住在农场东北十四千米外的基库尤人居留地，与法国天主教传教团相近，管辖着十余万基库尤人。他是个精明的老者，气度不凡，而且着实功绩卓著。他并非天生的酋长，而是在许多年前，由英国人任命的。当时，英国人再也无法与该地区的合法统治者和平共事。

吉南朱伊是我的朋友，曾有许多次对我施以援手。他的村寨我曾经骑马去过几次，和其他基库尤村寨一样灰尘密布，苍蝇满天，但确实是最大的一个村寨。作为酋长，吉南朱伊可以尽享婚姻的乐趣。因为有这么多老老少少的妻子，村子总是热闹异常。上至鸡皮鹤发、齿脱发苍的丑老太婆们，拄着拐杖；下至面如满月、眼如瞪羚的乡下姑娘们，双手和修长的玉腿上都戴满闪闪发光的黄铜镯子。他的子子孙孙跟苍蝇似的成群遍地，到处都是。他的儿子们都是趾高气扬、鼻孔朝天的年轻人，头上戴满装饰物，来来去去，四处惹是生非。吉南朱伊有一次告诉我：截至当时，他有五十五个身为武士的儿子。

有时，这位老酋长会屈尊下到农场来，总是身穿一件华贵的皮毛斗篷，两三个银发扈从随行，几个武士儿子前呼后拥着。他来串门儿，或者从政府事务中偷得半日闲，放松一下。一把走廊上的椅子被送到草地上，他坐在椅子上安度一个下午，抽着我送给他的雪茄，扈从和卫兵们三三两两散坐在他身边的草地上。仆人和棚民们一听说他来了，就会过来成群地聚在那儿，和他闲聊农场上发生的事。大树下，每位参与者共同组成了谈天说地的政治俱乐部。在这种场合下，吉南朱伊有一种独有的架子：当他觉得谈话已经离题太远，他便向后靠在椅背上，保持指间的雪茄燃着，微阖双眼，呼吸放得深长缓慢，发出均匀、轻微的鼾声，一种官派的、作秀似的睡眠。这可能是他潜心修炼出来，用在政务会议上的。我有时也搬把椅子出来跟他聊天，这种时候，吉南朱伊就会屏退左右，为了表示：这可是正经谈话，世界必得井井有条。我与他认识的时候，他已经老了，不复是年轻时的样子，生命极大地磨损了他。但每次单独相处时，他的谈话总无拘无束、坦率开放，充分展现他的创新精神，他拥有丰富多彩、敢想敢为、天马行空的想象力；对于人生，他曾反复思考，有属于自己的坚定理念。

几年前一件突发的事故，加深了我与吉南朱伊之间的友情。

一天，我正与一位路过农场去内地的朋友吃中饭，吉南朱伊突然造访；朋友离开之前，我没时间陪他。我觉得吉南朱伊在等待的时节，可能会想喝点儿什么，毕竟他刚刚在烈日下赶过长路，可是我手边没有一种饮品可放满一杯，于是我与朋友一起动手，把我府上的各种烈酒兑在一起，调了一大杯。我想：酒性越烈，吉南朱伊越会慢慢地喝，足以打发时间。我亲自捧着酒杯出来给了他。但是吉南朱伊露出绅士般的微微一笑，先是一口轻啜，向我投来最深沉的一瞥——还不曾有男人这样看过我，随即头一仰，把杯中酒一饮而尽，杯中涓滴不剩。

半小时后，朋友刚刚开车上路，我的仆人们进来说：“吉南朱伊死了。”刹那间，我感到悲剧与丑闻在我面前腾空而起，向我投下巨大沉重的阴影。我连忙出门探看他的死活。

他躺在草地上，厨房墙边的荫凉里，脸上全无表情，嘴唇和手指都发青，通体冰凉。好像一枪射杀了一头大象：只因你食指轻轻一勾，一个威风八面的庞然大物——它的脚步曾令大地震动，对万事万物都有独特见地——寸步不能动了。吉南朱伊又像是被罢免了，因为基库尤人脱下了他的猴皮大斗篷，正往他周身不停泼水。被扒个精光的他，像只被剥了皮的兽，人们正是为了拿兽皮当战利品才杀死它。

我打算派法拉去找医生来，但车发动不了，而吉南朱伊的手下也一直央求我们多等一会儿再采取行动。

一小时后，我又出来了，心情沉重，打算跟他们谈谈。仆人们跑过来，告诉我：“吉南朱伊回家了。”他霍然起身，斗篷往身上一裹，随从们簇拥着他，开步就走，直奔十四千米外他的村寨，没有给我留一句话。

我相信，那之后吉南朱伊就觉得我为他冒了险，甚至不惜冒大凶大险——因为当时是禁止给原住民酒精类饮料的——只为了让他开心。从此他再来农场，顶多只和我们一道抽支雪茄，再没提过喝什么的事。如果他要，我一定会给，但我知道他绝不会开口。




现在，我派了一个跑腿人去吉南朱伊的村寨，向他说明了整桩枪击事故，请他拔冗前来了结此案。我提出我们应该给万奈纳那条卡尼努提起的带犊母牛，然后让整件事到此为止。我对吉南朱伊的到来满怀期待，因为他有打动人的力量，能让每个人都视他为友。

只因我的信，这桩久已尘埃落定的事件风波又起，以一个戏剧性的尾声收场。

一天下午，我骑马回家时，一眼瞥见有辆车疾驰而来，速度快得令人惊恐，拐过弯道时，竟至于两轮悬空，只有另两轮着地。车身猩红，镀了厚厚的镍。我认识这辆车，它属于美国驻内罗毕总领事，我很纳闷，什么紧急事务居然使总领事以这等速度飞奔到我家。我在屋后下了马，法拉出来告诉我，酋长吉南朱伊来了，乘的是私家车，前几天刚从美国总领事手里买下来的。他不打算下车，为了让我看看他坐在车上的风采。

我发现吉南朱伊端坐在车里，人偶般一动不动。他披着一件蓝猴皮大斗篷，头戴无沿便帽，基库尤人用羊胃制的那种。他的形象一向很引人注目，高大魁梧，周身上下绝无赘肉；脸容傲慢，长脸型，骨骼分明，前倾的额头像印第安红人。他鼻头宽扁，如此先声夺人，是这个男人的中心焦点，仿佛他所有的堂堂仪表只是为了衬托这个大鼻子。正如大象的长鼻一样，既敢于探索，又极度敏感且谨慎小心，发起攻势时很猛烈，占据守势时又很稳健。总之，大象和吉南朱伊一样，或许外观不机灵，然而拥有一颗高贵庄严的头颅。

我对这辆豪车极尽赞美之词，而吉南朱伊一言不发，连脸颊肌肉都不抽动一下，他笔直地凝视着前方，我看到他的脸部轮廓，像刻在勋章上的头部侧像。我沿着车转了一圈，最后来到车前，他跟着我转头，保证他威严的侧脸一直对着我，也许在他的脑海深处，想的确实是卢比上的国王头像(1)。为他开车的是他年轻儿子们中的一个，车的水箱正沸腾得厉害。仪式结束，我恭请吉南朱伊抬步下车。他以一种岸然姿态，收拢他的大斗篷，走下车来。以这一个小动作，他一步踏回到两千年前，进入了基库尤人的正义法典。

我房子的西墙外，有一条石凳，石凳前是一张用磨盘做出来的桌子。这块磨盘可是来历悲惨：它曾经是块上磨盘，来自那两个被杀害的印度人的磨坊。血案之后，无人敢接手磨坊，它空置了很长时间，冷冷清清，于是我带这块磨盘回家做桌面，以寄托我对丹麦的思乡之情。印度磨坊主曾经告诉我，他们的磨盘乃是跨洋过海，来自孟买，因为非洲本地的石质硬度不足，无法承受碾磨的工作。磨盘的顶面刻有雕花，还有几块很大的褐色污渍在上面，仆人们坚持说它那是印度人的血迹，是去除不掉的。某种意义上，磨盘桌构成了农场中心，因为我经常坐在桌后处理原住民事务。某个除夕之夜，坐在磨盘桌后的石凳上，我与丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿一起看新月、金星木星交会，两星一月在空中紧密相连。何其壮丽的景观，你几乎不能相信它是真的，这样的天文盛事，我平生不曾再见。

现在我坐下来，请吉南朱伊坐在我左边的长凳上，法拉恭立在我右手处，在那个位置上，他可以警惕地留意基库尤人，他们在屋子周围挤得满满的，还正在持续不断地过来，因为吉南朱伊到访的消息已经传遍了农场。




法拉对本地原住民的态度堪称一景，同马赛人的盛装及面容一样，都属于冰冻三尺，非昨日或前日之寒，而是上千年来的积淀。这态度背后的力量，也曾搭建过美轮美奂的石头建筑。不过很久之前，这些建筑都已经轰然崩塌，成尘成埃了。

当你初抵这片国土，踏上蒙巴萨的疆域，你会看到，历尽沧桑的淡灰色面包树——不像地球植物，更像多孔的化石，巨型的箭石。(2)而在面包树之间，到处都是灰色石头的断垣残壁，房屋、清真寺的宣礼塔和水井。类似的废墟在沿海地带比比皆是，泰考格、嘉里非和拉穆古镇(3)都是如此。它们是古代阿拉伯城镇的遗骸，是从事象牙与奴隶贸易的商人们建造的。

阿拉伯商人知晓所有的非洲航线，他们的三角帆船乘风破浪，踏过碧波，开向桑给巴尔的中心市场。在很早之前，他们便对此驾轻就熟。那时，阿拉丁派四百位黑奴满载珠宝向苏丹王进贡；苏丹王妃趁王夫出外打猎，设宴款待她的黑人情人，且因此被杀(4)。

随着发家致富，豪商们很可能把妻妾们接了过来，带到了蒙巴萨和嘉里非，他们自己住在印度洋边的别墅里，远看银色海潮破空而来，近处花朵在枝头怒放，此时，他们派出的探险队正向高原出发。

从严峻苍凉的山野乡村上——那里干枯荒土焦痕处处，处处都是无名的戈壁滩；从河边生满金合欢树的丰美草原上——那里黑土地上的花朵芳香扑面，他们的财富滚滚而来。在非洲的屋脊上，这里徜徉着聪明高贵的庞然大物，天生就负载着象牙。它与世无争，只是沉思默想着，但愿这世界任由它去。但它被追踪，被万德罗博小黑人的毒箭射杀，被阿拉伯人前膛长枪射出的银头子弹击毙；它被诱捕，它跌进陷阱，这一切，只为了它长而华美、浅棕色的象牙。而富商们正在桑给巴尔坐等象牙到来。

也就是在这里，小片的森林沃土被砍伐焚尽，被一个老实本分的民族种上番薯和玉米。他们不擅征战，也没本事发明奇技淫巧，只希望不被理会，安静生活。而他们手中的象牙能在市场上大受欢迎。

那些掠食之鸟，或大或小，全在这里聚集了：

所有恐怖的食腐肉的鸟啊，

都落到了一起；

有些啄净头骨上的残余，

有些栖在绞架上，

在翅翼上擦净自己褐黄色的坚喙，

还有一只，它羽色纷乱，

正振翅飞离这阴森的杀人机械……



铁血无情的阿拉伯人来了，他们蔑视死亡，生长在商业时代，所以满脑子都是天文和代数学，身边带着妻妾。一道前来的，还有他们年轻的半阿拉伯血统兄弟索马里人——冲动，好战，饮食有禁忌，贪婪，他们成为虔诚的穆斯林，以此弥补他们出身上的先天不足(5)。他们忠于先知们的戒律，远胜过合法子孙——那些纯种阿拉伯人。斯瓦希里人也一同来了，他们是奴隶，也有一颗奴隶的心，粗野，下流，小偷小摸，多愁善感，爱开玩笑，会随着年龄增长而发胖。

向北方深入，他们与高原上土生土长的猛禽相遇了。马赛人来了，沉默不语，如一道道高而狭长的黑色阴影，一手持矛，一手掌着沉甸的盾，对陌生人疑心重重，觉得他们会拐卖自家兄弟。

这些各不相同的鸟儿，一定曾平起平坐，谈天论地过。法拉告诉我，以前，当索马里人还不曾从索马里兰带来同族女人，在全国各种族间，索马里青年只被允许与马赛人的女儿结合。在许多方面，这都注定是不般配的怨侣。索马里人很虔诚，但马赛人完全没有信仰，且对宗教全无兴趣；索马里人整洁，不惜大费周章在沐浴和卫生上，而马赛人脏得很；另外，索马里人把新娘的贞节视为重中之重，但马赛女子的节操观十分淡薄。法拉立刻给出了解释。他说，这是因为，马赛人宁死不当奴隶。他们不能被奴役，也不容被关押。一旦被逮捕入狱，必在三个月内死在狱中。所以本地的英国法律对马赛人不设监禁，代之以罚款。这种绝对不在枷锁下苟延残喘的义烈，在原住民各族中独一无二，使他们与移民贵族并列，赢得了索马里人的敬意。

所有的猛禽都把他们燃烧着的双眼贪婪地投向大地上温顺的草食动物。在这体系中，索马里人有自己的位置。索马里人不擅长各管各、独善其身，他们天性易激惹，而且，无论在哪里，如果没有外部力量干预，他们必定窝里斗，为本部落的道德制度耗尽时间，流尽鲜血。但一旦有人领导，他们又是很好的副手。也许那些阿拉伯资本家自己逗留在蒙巴萨，却经常让他们管理冒险犯难的生意和长途跋涉的运输。因此他们与原住民的关系，类同于牧羊犬与羊。前者永不疲倦地监督后者，亮出满口利齿。在到达海岸之前，他们会否死去？他们会否逃走？索马里人对金钱和价值观的追求都是孜孜不倦的，在命令之下，他们可以废寝忘食，每次远征归来，一定瘦得皮包骨头。

这习性已经深入他们的血液，根深蒂固。当农场上爆发西班牙流感时，法拉自己也病得很厉害，但他紧随我左右，发着高烧，打着哆嗦，给棚民们送去药物，强迫他们服用。他听人说石蜡是这种疾病的特效药，便为农场买来了石蜡。他弟弟阿卜杜拉，当时与我们生活在一起，也染上了流感，病情危重，法拉极其担忧。但是这偏爱是深藏于心的，无可流露。职责、面包、在农场员工间的声誉，才是一切，这头奄奄一息的牧羊犬仍在坚守岗位。对原住民圈子发生的大小事务，法拉总是了如指掌，虽然我从不知道他的消息来源是什么，他与基库尤人向无往来，除了其中一些跻身高位者。

而羊自己呢，这柔顺的民族，没有利爪也没有钢牙，软弱无力，也全无守护者，以逆来顺受的天赋本能，从前他们听天由命，现在仍然如此。他们不是马赛人，在枷锁下宁死不屈，也不是索马里人，一旦深信自己受到损害、欺骗或轻视，就激烈地反抗命运。哪怕在异国他乡，哪怕镣铐加身，他们都以神为友。有人压迫他们，而他们对这种迫害与被迫害的关系，也有自己的独特感受。他们总是觉得迫害者的利益和威望是与他们相一致的：他们是追逐的中心，贸易的标的，他们就是商品本身。经过漫长的血泪历程，羊们在他们愚昧闭塞的心里，为自己建立了一套卑贱者的哲学，既看不起牧羊人也看不起牧羊犬。“你们日夜不得休息，”他们说，“你们跑得喘息连连，舌头都吐了出来。你们终夜不能睡，所以白天双眼干涩刺痛——这一切都是为了我们。你们在这里全是因为我们。你们为了我们而存在，我们却并非因为你们才存在。”农场上的基库尤人有时对法拉嬉皮笑脸，就像一只羔羊会跳到牧羊犬脸上，以引逗后者跳起来追它。

法拉与吉南朱伊相会在此地，一个是牧羊犬，另一个是老领头羊。法拉笔直而立，戴着红蓝相间的穆斯林头巾，黑色刺绣阿拉伯背心，阿拉伯丝织长袍，成竹在胸，如此高雅得体，这样的人物你在世界各地都会见到。而吉南朱伊摊开四肢坐在石凳上，几乎全裸，只从肩上垂下一挂猴皮披风，一个原住民老头，一个用非洲高原泥土拓出的土块人形。他们彼此以礼相待，不直接打交道时，为了与礼俗保持一致，便假装没有看到对方。

很容易想象这二位在一百年前抑或更早就奴隶转手事项进行会谈的场面，奴隶都是部落里不受欢迎的人，或者吉南朱伊想摆脱的那些人。从头到尾，法拉都想向老酋长本人这块肥肉猛扑过去，把他当作战利品收入自己的行囊。他得一直控制这冲动，把它压到意识最底层。关于法拉的念头，吉南朱伊洞若观火，明察秋毫。全程会谈中，他都承受着局势的重负，这重负也包括了恐惧和心情紧张。因为他就是中心人物，他就是商品本身。

关于枪击案最后裁决的会议在平和的气氛下召开。农场上的人很高兴看到吉南朱伊出席。年纪最长的老棚民起身过来，向他致意，再坐回草地上的原处。几位坐在人群外缘的老妇人大声尖叫欢迎我：“你好，杰里(6)。”“杰里”是个基库尤名字，农场的老妇人这样称呼我，非常小的小毛头们也这么喊，但年轻妇女或老男人从不这样叫我。卡尼努已经在会场上了，坐在他庞大家庭的中央，多少有些像个正在对生命呐喊的稻草人，双目灼灼，一眨不眨。万奈纳与他的母亲也来了，坐在离其他人稍远处。

我放慢语速，郑重其事地通知大家：卡尼努与万奈纳之间的纠纷已经了结，协议写在白纸黑字上。吉南朱伊来为此做见证。卡尼努将给付万奈纳一头带子母牛，此事就此了断，否则没人受得了。

卡尼努和万奈纳在事前已经被通知了裁决内容，卡尼努早准备好母牛和牛犊。万奈纳的表现，宛如一只生活在地底下的生灵，活像只鼹鼠来到日光底下的地面上，一举一动也如鼹鼠般轻手轻脚。

我念完协议，吩咐卡尼努把母牛带过来，卡尼努站起身，对他的两个儿子双臂上下挥舞了好半天，他们正牵着牛，站在仆人房的后面。人群为它们闪开一条路，母牛和牛犊被缓缓带入会场。

顿时，会场气氛为之一变。仿佛地平线上有暴风雨不期而至，并将顷刻间雨势倾盆。

在这世上，再没有比带犊母牛更引发基库尤人关注和重视的了。血案、巫术、性爱抑或白人世界的种种不可思议，在他们对牲畜满是热爱的烈焰熔炉旁，全都燃为灰烬，转眼无踪。这热情带着旧石器时代的气味，像你击石取出的火。

万奈纳的母亲突然发出一声长长的号叫，对着母牛摇动她瘦干的胳膊和手指。万奈纳也和她一道，结结巴巴，讲得支离破碎，仿佛不是他自己在说，而是有人在通过他的嘴发言，他提高声音，几乎可以上达天听。他拒收这头牛。它是卡尼努牛群里最老的一头，这头现在它脚边上的牛犊肯定是最后一头，它生不出小牛了。

卡尼努家族怒吼起来，悲愤地打断他，开始七嘴八舌细数这头母牛的种种好处。你能听出在他们的字里行间，有巨大的愤恨，以及一种“有种你杀了我”的豁出去。

当吵架围绕牛和牛犊进行时，农场上的人是无法维持肃静的。人人都要贡献自己的意见。老人们抓着彼此的胳膊，长出一口气后，对母牛论长道短，褒贬不一，一边还呼哧带喘。老妇人们的尖嗓子，在旁边插着嘴，连声附和，那声音像加农炮的轰鸣。年轻人声音低低的，不时对彼此迸出几句简单尖刻的评语。有两三分钟，我房外的空地上，像烧开了的巫婆大锅，沸反盈天。

我看向法拉，他也看向我，表情有如还在梦中。我看出来，此刻的他已经宝剑半出鞘，转瞬间，就将在冲突里左劈右杀。毕竟，索马里人不单养牲畜，也是牲畜交易商。卡尼努向我投来溺水者般的眼神，自知最终将被洪流卷走。我看了一眼母牛。它是一头灰母牛，双角弯得很厉害，正心平气和地站在这场它引起的龙卷风的中心地带。所有手指都在对它指指点点，它却开始低头舔舐它的牛犊。不管怎么说，我觉得它的样子确实像一头老牛。

最后，我调转眼光看向吉南朱伊。我拿不准他到底有没有看一眼母牛，总之在我的眼皮底下，他连眉毛都没挑一下，端坐不动，仿佛纯粹只是一个庞大的躯壳，无善恶亦无爱憎，只是盘踞在我的房子里。他向喧闹的人群转过脸去，我意识到他的侧面像有多像真正的王者面容。这是原住民生而俱来的能力，能用最简单的动作，霎时化身为非生物的存在。我相信吉南朱伊一旦开口说话或者行动，必定令在场人群火上加油，因为正是他沉默的端坐镇压住了他们。并非人人都能做到这一点。

一点一点，狂怒渐渐死寂下去，人们不再尖叫狂吼，而改用日常态度对话，到最后，他们一个个安静下来。万奈纳的母亲，自以为无人注意到，撑在拐杖上向母牛蹒跚了几步，为了凑近看个端详。法拉回过神来，重返文明社会，带着一抹淡淡的、歪歪斜斜的微笑。

当万事都平息，我们让案件的双方当事人都走到磨石盘周围，用大拇指蘸了油膏在协议上盖指印。万奈纳很不情愿，一边按指印一边还在小声嘀嘀咕咕，仿佛协议书烧手。协议如下：

下述协议在万奈纳·瓦·贝姆和卡尼努·瓦·木秋之间签订。订约日期为今天，九月二十六日；地点为恩贡；酋长吉南朱伊在场作为见证。

本协议陈述：卡尼努将付给万奈纳一头带犊母牛。母牛和母牛犊将交给万奈纳的儿子万扬格里，后者在去年十二月十九日被卡尼努的儿子卡贝罗开枪误伤。母牛和牛犊将成为万扬格里的财产。

母牛和牛犊交清后，本案将最终结案。此后，任何人不得再谈论或提及此事。

恩贡，九月二十六日

农场访客


“一切毁灭之后”





盛大舞会


在农场上我们有很多访客。在拓荒者的国度里，好客是生活的必需品，对旅行者来说如此，对定居者亦然。一个客人是一位朋友，他带来的消息不论好坏，对独在异乡为异客的饥渴灵魂来说，都是食粮。而知心好友如果登门拜访，不啻于送来天使灵粮(1)的天国使者。

每当丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿从长途探险中归来，迫不及待想找人攀谈，就会发现我在农场上也有同感，于是我们在餐桌前，通宵达旦，直坐到后半夜，聊我们想到的一切，指点江山，谈笑万户侯。与原住民共同生活过很长时间的白人会渐渐养成有一说一的习惯，因为原住民不需要也没有机会装腔作势。这些白人每次在一起，交谈也都保持着原住民的这种坦诚。那时，我们一直推测，住在山脚下村寨里的原始马赛部落，会举头瞻望我们灯火通明的房子，宛如夜空里的一颗星辰，就像翁布里亚(2)农夫看圣方济各(3)和圣克莱尔(4)曾在其中畅谈神学问题的那一座宅子。

农场上最盛大的社交活动，就属恩贡玛了——大型原住民舞会。这样的场合，我们要迎接一千五到两千名宾客，提供恰如其分的款待。我们给跳舞的年轻武士和恩迪拖斯（少女）的光头老母亲们鼻烟，在允许携带儿童的舞会上，给孩子们的则是糖，卡曼特用大木匙盛着分发。我有时会请求地区长官的特许，容棚民们酿造特步酒，以甘蔗为原料，酒性极烈。真正的表演者是那些不知疲倦的年轻舞者，是他们带来光芒与绚烂的盛宴。他们不被外界干扰，只醉心于自己内心奔腾的激越和甜美。向全世界，他们只有唯一的索求：一块平坦的场地用以舞蹈，仅此而已。这样的地方，大宅附近可以找到：树荫下草坪一望无垠，仆人房之间的小广场也一样平展。周边的年轻人对农场的环境赞不绝口，都很乐意受邀参加我家的舞会。

恩贡玛有时在白天举行，有时是晚上。日间恩贡玛需要更广阔的场地，因为被舞蹈吸引前来观看的观众与舞者一样多，所以在草坪上举行。在大多恩贡玛上，舞者站成一个大圆圈或者几个小圆圈，不时跳上跃下，向后扬头，要么有节奏地在地上踏足，先单脚用力前倾，再换另一只脚；要么反反复复、缓慢而庄重地绕圈子，不休不止，所有人的脸都冲着圆心。那些光芒四射的舞者独立于圆圈之外，表演，跳跃，在场中奔跑。日间恩贡玛后，草坪上留有舞者们踏出来的脚印，是或大或小、干燥尘土色的圆环状痕迹，仿佛上面的青草被一把火烧得精光。这些神奇的圆环会随着时日渐渐减退。

日间恩贡玛不太像舞会，更像市集。观众跟随舞者蜂拥而至，成群结队待在树下。如果恩贡玛的消息传得够远，甚至能看到内罗毕的窈窕女郎们——斯瓦希里语称为玛拉亚，是句好话——她们乘坐阿里·汗的骡车前来，打扮入时，周身裹着大幅艳丽的印花棉布，图案都是大花大彩。她们落座后，宛如草地上大朵大朵盛放的鲜花。农场上规矩的年轻女孩们穿着传统式样、涂油打蜡的皮短裙和披风，凑近她们坐着，对她们的着装做派直言不讳地品头论足。而这些都市佳丽双腿交叉，一声不响，如同黑木雕就、玻璃眼儿的洋娃娃，自顾抽着小雪茄。孩子们呼啸而来，为舞会欣喜若狂，全心全意在学习在模仿，从一个舞圈冲向另一个舞圈，或者跑到一边去，在草坪边缘上，组成自己的小小舞圈，尽情上蹦下跳。

基库尤人参加恩贡玛时，会在全身上下涂抹一种专门的粉红色粉末。这种粉末需求量很大，因此都是商家买来出售的；涂上粉末，能令他们呈现出一种奇异的白皙感及透红感。那颜色既非动物会有，也不是植物界能出现的，这样装扮过的年轻人，像用石头凿成的雕像，周身都是风化的石纹。少女们以珠绣镶边的典雅皮制外套罩在花纹外，与花纹别无二致，带着泥土的气息，看去如此浑然一体——这一尊尊着衣的塑像，身上的每一个褶皱、每一块布料，莫不出自能工巧匠们的精心制作。恩贡玛上的少年是全裸的，不过在这样隆重的场合，他们会百般装饰自己的发型，在鬓毛和辫子上扑粉，再将满是粉末、石灰岩般的头颅仰得高高的。我在非洲最后几年，政府禁止人们往头上扑粉。不过，这样的装扮对男女两性都效果非凡：钻石与华饰，对穿戴者来说，并不能更好地点缀节日气氛。无论何时，当你远远瞥见，原野上，一群扑着红粉的基库尤人结队走过，你能立刻感觉到，连空气都因狂欢而轻轻震颤。

日场的露天舞会，苦于舞场的无边无垠。舞台过分广阔——哪里是开始，哪里又是终点？独舞者的小小身形全都五颜六色，一整张鸵鸟背部的皮在他们脑后晃荡；风流豪侠似的鸡矩(5)状腿饰缚在小腿上，是疣猴皮制成的；他们在大树下站得零零散散。你忍不住东张西望：这一切都是表演——大大小小的舞圈，铺天盖地的观众群，孩子们忽焉在前，忽焉在后——不断把你的眼线从一个角落牵向另一个角落。整个画面如同一幅描绘战争的古画，画面的视角是从高处俯瞰的。你会看到：一侧骑兵队冲锋在前，另一侧炮兵队正在各就各位，而一位军械官疾驰的孤单身影试图斜穿画面。

此外，日间恩贡玛非常嘈杂。长笛与鼓的舞曲乐声时常被观众的喧嚣声淹没；跳舞女郎们发出长长的尖啸声，声调怪异，以配合摆出姿势的男舞者——年轻武士们，他们在跳跨，或者以异常优美的姿势在头顶上挥舞长矛。草地上，老人们聊得十分投机，音浪如流水浩浩荡荡。看几个基库尤老太太在畅谈，是很让人心情愉快的。一个葫芦搁在几个人之间，她们全心全意聊得正高兴，想来是在叙说那些她们在舞圈中崭露头角的岁月。她们的脸孔，因这美好的喜悦越来越容光焕发：这样的一个下午，阳光低垂，葫芦里有仿佛取之不尽的鼻烟。这时，几位老先生加入人群，一位老妇人被她年轻日子的记忆推动着，颤巍巍起身，挥动手臂，摆出真正的少女姿态，小跑一两步。人群不曾注意到她，但她同龄人组成的小圈子里，立刻爆发了热烈的喝彩与掌声。

但夜间恩贡玛才是人们的挚爱。

夜间恩贡玛只在秋季举行，玉米已割，月圆如镜。我不认为其中有什么宗教意味，但很可能曾经令人心生虔念：舞者与观众的一举一动，都令人想起神秘庄严的时刻。舞蹈也许已流传千年，其中有些颇受舞者们的母亲和老祖母们赞叹，却被白人移民认为是有伤风化，必须着手以法律禁止。一次，我结束了在欧洲的度假返回非洲，正是咖啡收割的大忙季节，却发现有二十五位年轻武士被经理送进了监狱，因为他们在夜间恩贡玛上跳了禁舞。经理告诉我，他太太对这些舞誓不能容忍。我斥责棚民中的长者，怪他们不该在经理家附近召开恩贡玛，但他们严肃地向我表示：他们是在卡瑟古的村寨跳的，离经理家足有八九千米。我只好前往内罗毕，与地区长官交涉，长官放回了所有舞者，容他们回农场收割咖啡。

夜间舞会精彩纷呈。在这里，你会确定无疑地以为身在露天剧场，一堆堆篝火建筑了它，火光所到之处，皆为舞场。生火并非为了舞会照明，因为非洲高原的皎白月光如银辉泻地，明亮到不可思议，火是用来营造效果的。它令这一片用来跳舞的空地成为表演性的舞台，又囊括了所有缤纷色泽、所有进退腾挪，令它们合而为一。

原住民几乎从不过度渲染气氛，不会令篝火烧得太旺盛。柴火是在舞会当天由原住民妇女扛到舞场上的，她们以盛会的女主人自居，把舞圈中央的柴火堆得很高。老妇人们的到来让舞会很有面子，她们围坐在场中央的火堆旁，小火堆在她们身边排列如星环。整晚，要为它们不断添柴。以森林之夜为背景板，舞者们在火圈之外舞蹈奔跑。场地要足够大，否则烟气和热气会熏到老观众们的眼睛。但它仍是天下一处与世隔绝的场所，恰如一间绝大的房子，能容下所有人，能做一切事。

对于相映成趣或者对照，原住民既无概念也无偏好；大自然与他们之间的脐带尚未完全切断。他们只在满月期间举办恩贡玛。月亮尽善尽美，他们也是。空地沐浴在夜空柔和璀璨的清辉里，为了给非洲大地增光添彩，他们也略尽绵薄，献上小小的光与热。

客人们成群结队地到来，有时三三两两，有时十几个人——熟人间往往是呼朋唤友相约同来，也有时是在路上遇到就结伴而行。为了参加恩贡玛，许多舞者要步行二十四千米。多人同行时，往往随身带着长笛和鼓，于是，大型舞会之夜，乡间大道或田间小路上，乐声回荡，此起彼伏，连月面上都仿佛有铃声响彻。在舞圈的入口，这些徒步者们站定，等舞圈为他们打开；有时，他们来自很远很远的地方，或者是邻近大酋长的儿郎，会受到隆重欢迎，有人专程出面引他们进入，出面的往往是一位老年棚民、农场上著名舞者或者舞会的管事。

恩贡玛的管事和其他人一样，都是农场上的年轻人，但他们出席舞会是为了保证舞会秩序的，个个都尽忠职守。在舞会开始前，他们脸色凝重，眉头紧锁，在舞者们面前来来回回；舞会气氛越来越高涨，他们就不停地从一侧跑到另一侧，确保一切按部就班。他们全副武装地举着束成一捆捆的树枝，不断把一端伸向篝火，保证它们一直在燃烧。他们始终警惕地监视着舞者们，无论何地，一旦觉察到有人不规矩，他们就会第一时间抵达现场，脸色狰狞，厉声咆哮，猛掷出手中的整捆树枝，让着火的一端朝前，笔直砸在不轨者身上。被击中的人，疼得弯下腰去，却一声不吭。也许，从恩贡玛上带回这样的烧伤，也算不上什么丢人现眼的事儿吧。

在一出舞蹈中，少女们会故作矜持地站在少年的脚背上，双手环过少年的腰肢；而年轻武士们的双臂从她头的两侧向外伸开，双手紧握住长矛，不时举起，再用尽全力刺向地面。这构成了一幅美好的画面：部落里的年轻女子们依偎在良人怀里，以他们为避风港；而男人们捍卫她们，甚至让她们站在自己脚上，保护她们免遭蛇咬，免除来自地面的一切威胁。当舞会延续数小时之后，所有舞者的脸孔上都呈现出如痴如醉的狂热，仿佛他们真的随时打算为对方去死。

还有其他舞蹈：舞者在火堆间跑进奔出，而领舞者不断跳得老高，跃得很远，许多矛在挥舞。我觉得，这是对猎狮活动的模拟。

除了笛和舞之外，在恩贡玛上也有歌手。有些歌手在乡间无人不知，从很远处受邀前来。与其说他们是演唱，毋宁说是有节律地吟诵。他们都擅长即兴作歌，出口成章，而舞者们殷勤的呼应迅速参与进来。在夜晚的清芬里，听温柔的清歌，嗓音渐渐提高，反复吟唱，和着许多年轻声音的合唱，真有一曲销魂之感。但如果彻夜皆是，配合鼓点不时地响起，它会变得要命地无聊，听着说不出地烦人，再多唱一秒钟你都受不了，它如果戛然而止，你也一样难受。

我在的时候，最知名的歌手来自达戈莱蒂，他有一副清越高亢的好嗓子，此外，他还是一个出色的舞者。他一边唱，一边或走或跑，以长长的滑步进入舞圈，每一步一个半蹲。他的一只手举在嘴角，很可能是为了起到扩音效果，但给人的观感却是：他正在向众人吐露最危险的惊天秘密。他本人仿佛就是非洲的回音。他可以随心所欲地令观众欣喜若狂或者群情贲张，甚至笑得死去活来。他唱起一首凄厉的歌，一首战歌，我依稀感觉，在歌中，他描绘了翻山越岭，走家串巷，去号召所有族人参战，向他们细述大屠杀以及洗劫的惨景。一百年前，这歌会令白人移民们不寒而栗。但通常他没这么可怕。有一晚他唱了三首歌，我让卡曼特为我翻译。第一首是幻曲：假想所有舞者正乘风破浪去往洛维亚。第二首歌，卡曼特解释说，是对老妪们的赞歌，献给所有歌手和舞者的母亲及老祖母。歌声甜美，曲子很长，势必一一细述了那些齿脱发秃的基库尤老太太的淑德与慈祥，坐在场地中央柴火堆旁的她们，边听边频频点头。第三首歌很短，却引得每个人都哈哈大笑，歌手提高了他极富穿透力的歌喉以盖住音浪，自己也边唱边笑。老妇人们被这么好好奉承了一把，个个心情舒畅，听到这里拍着大腿，咧嘴大笑，活像一群鳄鱼。卡曼特不肯为我翻译，只说全是废话，简而又简地讲了几句。歌的主题很简单：在前段时间的鼠疫过后，政府给每一只上缴到地区长官处的老鼠都定了价——这歌说的就是被四处捉拿的老鼠们，如何仓皇逃生，在部落里老中青妇女们的床上藏身，而在床上，又发生了些什么什么。细节肯定相当有趣，我却无从得知；连卡曼特自己，当他满心不情愿地为我翻译时，偶尔也禁不住露出压抑的笑纹。

在一次夜间恩贡玛上，一桩戏剧化的事件发生了。

这次恩贡玛是一次欢送会，专程为即将启程前往欧洲旅行的我饯行。那一年我们收成不错，因此舞会规模宏大，约有一千五百名基库尤人在场。上床前，我又出来看了一眼，当时舞会已经开了几个小时，有人为我安排了一把椅子，背靠仆人房，几位老棚民也过来招呼我。

只在一瞬间，一阵剧烈的骚动传遍了所有的舞圈，一种又惊又惧的极度不安，一种奇怪的音浪，仿佛有风吹过河床。舞蹈慢了，更慢了，但还没完全停下来。我问一位老人发生了什么事。他压低声音迅速回答：“马赛人纳枯德加。”——马赛人来了。

消息一定是由一个跑腿人带来的，因为过了很大一会儿，还是什么也没发生。很可能基库尤人送信回去说：客人会受到接待。马赛人是禁止参加基库尤人的恩贡玛的，过去他们出席惹过太多乱子。仆人们都来了，站在我的椅子旁。每个人都看向舞场的入口。当马赛人迈步进来，所有人的舞步不约而同停了下来。

有十二位年轻的马赛武士走了进来，几步后，他们立定等着，眼看前方，并不左顾右盼。火光闪耀下，他们不时眨眨眼。他们全裸，只佩有武器和华美的头饰。其中一个戴着“磨难人”作战时才佩戴的狮皮头饰。他们自膝到脚，笔直刷了一条宽宽的猩红条纹，仿佛是血顺着腿流下。他们挺立着，双腿笔直，头向后扬起，沉默，如死般肃穆，无论是胜利凯旋还是沦为阶下囚，他们都是这样，始终如一。能感觉到，来参加恩贡玛他们其实也不得已。单调的鼓声飘过河流，飘进他们的居留地。鼓声在响，鼓声在响，令那里的年轻武士们好生为难；有十二个人无法抗拒这呼唤。

基库尤人也情绪骚动起来，但对客人表现得还是很有礼貌。农场的首席舞者欢迎他们进入舞圈，他们各就各位时，舞圈里一片死静。舞蹈重又开始。但是，与刚刚的舞会完全不一样了，气氛很滞重。鼓点打起来，声音较大，节奏也较快。假使恩贡玛继续下去，我们会看到一些惊人的壮举，基库尤人和马赛人会各自炫技，向彼此展示自己的气势和舞蹈本领。但是很可惜，这一幕不曾上演：有些事，注定不会发生，即使相关人士都抱着美好心愿期待着。

事件如何爆发，我不知道。只在刹那间，舞圈动摇了，解散了，有人在大声尖叫，有几秒钟工夫，我面前的整个场地上，人群纠结着，奔跑着，挤作一堆，到处都是口哨声和身体摔到地面的声音，在我们头顶上，夜色随矛的伸缩而闪烁不定。我们全站了起来，即使是位于舞场中心的贤德老妇人们，也爬上柴火垛，想看看发生了什么事。

当激情渐渐平息，打作一团的人群陆续散去，我发现自己周围全是人，只在我身侧留了一小块空地。两位老棚民来到我面前，勉为其难地向我一五一十说明：马赛人违背法律和禁令，惹出乱子，带来不好的后果。一个马赛人和三个基库尤人重伤，“被砍成一段一段”，他们这样表述。他们严肃地问我，是否允许把他们的伤口缝起来——否则瑟利克利（政府）可能会找每个人的大麻烦。我问老人，伤者哪里被切下来了。“头。”他骄傲地回答，以原住民危言耸听、夸大其词的天性。我看到，这时卡曼特正穿过场地，拿着纫了长线的织补针和我的顶针，向我走来。我还在犹豫，老阿瓦鲁已经越众而出。他曾入狱，在那七年中学会了缝纫手艺。为了得到一次练习的机会，他一定翘首期盼了很久，终于得以大展身手，他自告奋勇接下这差事，立刻所有人的注意力都落到了他身上。他确实缝合了伤者，他们在他手里痊愈，日后，他一直视此为自己的丰功伟绩。不过卡曼特肯定地告诉我：那几个人的头没有被砍下来。

因为马赛人参加基库尤人舞会是非法的，有很长一段时间，我们不得不把受伤的马赛人藏在一间小屋里，那是为白人宾客的仆佣们准备的。他在小屋里康复，最后也从那里不辞而别，甚至不曾对阿瓦鲁道一声谢。我相信，对马赛人来说，在基库尤人手里受伤——又在基库尤人手里治愈，完全是奇耻大辱。

夜间恩贡玛接近尾声，我走出屋外，想问问受伤者的情形，却发现，在雾霭霭的晨曦里，篝火渐熄，却还冒着烟。一些年轻的基库尤人站在火堆边忙活着，在万奈纳老母亲这个老掉牙的婆子领导下，一边跳上跳下，一边把长棍往余烬里戳。他们是在念咒，保证马赛人在与基库尤少女们的情爱事儿上不会得手。

亚洲来客


恩贡玛是源远流长、睦邻友好的社会活动。随着时间过去，先是我起初认识的那些舞者的弟弟妹妹，然后是儿女们，来到了跳舞场上。

除此之外，我们还有来自遥远异国的客人。季风从孟买刮来：见多识广的睿智长者，乘船从印度出发，万里迢迢来到农场。

在内罗毕有位印度木材大商户，名叫乔雷姆·侯赛因。我早期开垦农场的时候，与他做过很多笔交易。他是一个虔诚的穆斯林，也是法拉的朋友。一天，他造访我家，请我允许他带一位印度来的伊玛目来做客。乔雷姆·侯赛因告诉我：这位伊玛目漂洋过海，是为了视察内罗毕和蒙巴萨的会众。本地会众则很希望能好好接待他，集思广益之下，再也想不出比参观农场更好的安排了。我能让他来吗？我答说不胜荣幸。乔雷姆·侯赛因向我说明：这位伊玛目地位如此尊崇，身份如此高贵，凡是异教徒用过的锅，煮出来任何东西他都不会吃。但我不用操心这个，他很快加了一句：内罗毕的穆斯林会众将准备佳肴，且及时送出；我在家里要做的，仅仅只是容伊玛目在我府上用餐。可以吗？我同意了。过了一会儿，乔雷姆·侯赛因又吃力地提起话头：没别的要点了，就一个。每当伊玛目莅临一处，按礼节他都应该收到一份礼物，在一户我这样的人家，这数字不能低于一百卢比。但我无须为难，他迅速说道，钱已经由内罗毕的穆斯林募集，只请我转交伊玛目即可。我问：但伊玛目会相信这是我送的礼物吗？对这个问题，从乔雷姆·侯赛因的嘴里挖不出答案来。很多时候，有色人种不肯把事情说得一清二楚，徒耗时间。起初我对这个为我专设的角色没什么兴趣，但当我看到乔雷姆·侯赛因和法拉失望的表情——而就在片刻之前，他们还满怀希望，容光焕发——于是我放弃了我的骄傲，打定主意：伊玛目愿意怎么想就怎么想吧。

约好到访的日子，我却把这事忘得干干净净，正在田里试驾我的新拖拉机。卡曼特的弟弟替替被派来找我。拖拉机声如春雷，我完全听不到他在说什么，我也不敢停车，因为拖拉机启动很困难。替替像一条发了疯的小狗似的，在刚刚犁过的田里，深一脚浅一脚追着它跑。拖拉机身后扬起长长烟尘，他跑得上气不接下气。到了地头，我终于停下来。“阿訇已经到了。”他对我嘶吼道。“什么阿訇？”我反问。“所有的阿訇。”他自豪地说：他们分乘四辆车抵达，每车六人。我和他一起回家，甫一靠近，我便看见草坪上聚了很多白袍的身影，仿佛一群雪白大鸟，驻扎在我房子附近，抑或天使们成群结队突然下降到农场上。想来是整支宗教法庭都从印度远赴万里，只为了保证非洲纯正信仰的炽焰。但是，一眼就会认出伊玛目的高贵形象，不会弄错，他面朝我而立，由两位下属护持。乔雷姆·侯赛因站在不远处，与他保持一个尊敬有礼的距离。他是个矮小的老人，脸容清秀，五官柔和，仿佛是用年代久远的象牙雕刻出来的。我们会面时，他的扈从们先是近身保护，随后散去，他们可能以为我打算独自招待客人。

我们无法交谈，因为他不懂英语也不懂斯瓦希里语，而我对他的语言一窍不通。双方只得比手画脚来互致最崇高的敬意。我看出，已经有人带他参观过房子，所有的杯盘碗碟都在餐桌上摆放周全，花朵都按照印度与索马里风情一一陈设。我与他一道走到西墙边的石凳上坐下。就在这里，大家屏息期待，我在众目睽睽下，呈上包在乔雷姆·侯赛因一方绿手帕里的一百卢比。

因为这古老的礼数，不知怎的，我对这位伊玛目有些先入为主的偏见——看到他如此苍老矮小，霎时间，我想这场面或许也让他尴尬。但当我们并肩坐在午后的熙阳下，即使想假装聊些什么，也无计可施，只能以亲善的态度互通有无，我感到，对他来说，世上没有什么会使他羞窘。他有一种特殊的安泰姿态，仿佛万事皆在掌握中。他举止谦恭慈和，当我把群山和树木指给他看时，他不时颔首微笑，好像对一切都颇感兴味，任何事都不能让他大惊小怪。我想知道，这种包容，是基于对世间邪恶的一无所知，抑或对邪恶知道得太深太深，已经习以为常。因为，不管是世上本无毒蛇，还是你在血液里注射了超量毒素令你达到完全免疫状态，到最后总殊途同归。老人的平静脸孔宛如还不曾学会说话的新生儿，对所有事物都好奇，而尚不曾建立大吃一惊的本能。在石凳上，这个下午的一小时光阴里，仿佛陪我坐着的，是一位稚童，一位圣婴，某位绘画大师笔下的圣子耶稣——时不时地，我在意识里伸出一只脚，晃一晃这个虚拟摇篮的摇杆。世间那些极老的妇人，什么都见识过，什么都经历过，也会有这样的面容。这并非雄赳赳的男人脸相——它与襁褓、女子的衣衫很协调，此刻跟我这位老客人身上华美的羊绒长袍也搭配无间。在穿男装的男人身上，我只看到过一次这样的表情，那是在一家马戏团，一个伶俐的小丑脸上。

其他的阿訇在乔雷姆·侯赛因带领下，去河边看山景，老人累了，不想起身。老人自己状若大鸟，似乎也对鸟类很注意。那段时间我在家里驯养了一只鹳，还养了一群鹅，从来不杀，只是为了让这里更像丹麦。长老对它们很感兴趣，指着天边，想弄清楚它们是从哪里来的。我的狗也在草坪上，使得这个千年盛世下午的形象臻于完美。我还以为法拉和乔雷姆·侯赛因会把它们关到狗屋里呢，因为乔雷姆·侯赛因，作为虔诚的穆斯林，无论何时来农场谈生意，看到它们都非常恐慌。但此刻，它们在白袍的阿訇们之间逛来逛去，一如狮子在羊群里闲荡。这是伊斯梅尔称赞过的那些狗，能一眼认出穆斯林。

告别前，伊玛目送了我一枚珍珠戒指留念。于是我觉得，除了那拿不出手的卢比外，我本人也该送他件礼物。我打发法拉到库房，去取不久前我在农场上猎杀的一张狮皮。老人目光炯炯地握住一只狮爪，小心地在自己脸上试了试爪的锋利。

他走后，我不由怀疑，他微微前倾的高贵头颅里面，是否能记住农场视野中的吉光片羽，抑或水过无痕。不过有些事他真的注意到了，因为三个月后，我收到一封印度来信，地址错得离谱，以至邮路耽误了很久。在信中，一位印度王子请我卖给他一只我的“灰狗”，是伊玛目向他提起的，并让我自己报价。





索马里妇女


有一群访客，在农场很有分量，我不能写得太多，因为她们会不喜欢。她们就是法拉家的女人们。

法拉结婚后，把太太从索马里兰带到了农场上，和她同来的，是一群叽叽喳喳、温柔活泼的小小灰鸽子：她母亲、她妹妹、在她家长大的一个小表妹。法拉告诉我，这是他国家的风俗。索马里兰的婚姻由家里的长辈安排，他们衡量双方的生辰时日、财富和年轻人的名誉。在上等人家，新郎新娘在婚前是无缘得见的。不过索马里人是个颇具骑士风范的民族，不会把他们的姑娘们置于无依无靠、恓恓惶惶的境界。婚礼举行后，新婚丈夫要在妻子的家里住上半年，这是他们的美好风俗，这期间，她仍是在自己的地盘上做女主人，是一个人所皆知、影响力十足的人物。有时新郎做不到这一点，新娘的女亲戚们则义不容辞地簇拥新娘共同踏入婚姻生活，哪怕这对她们意味着举家搬迁，在异国他乡漂泊。

后来，法拉又收养了部落里一个丧母的小女孩，我家里的索马里妇女小圈子正式完成。我想，收养嫁期临近的少女，未必完全不着眼于有利可图，就像末底改收养以斯帖那样(1)。这小姑娘特别聪明伶俐，天性活泼，看她一点点长大，女人们如何手把手地料理她，精心培育，把她调教成大家闺秀，真是令人称奇。她刚来我家时，只有11岁，经常从家长严格的管教中跑出来，跟着我走来走去，骑我的小马，扛我的枪，或者跟基库尤僮仆们一起跑到鱼塘边，撩起短裙，赤着双脚，扛着抄网，在岸边的泥地里飞跑。索马里小姑娘们剃光头发，只绕着头顶留一圈黑鬈发，最高处有长长的一绺；这发型很漂亮，也令这孩子像一个欢天喜地、惯会淘气的小和尚。只是，时日推移，在年长女子们的潜移默化下，她变了，对这女大十八变的魔力着了迷，心甘情愿地洗心革面。简直就像双腿系上了重物，她的步伐慢下来，越发慢下来；她双目低垂，仪态万方，陌生人一造访，便消失得踪影全无，且将之视为名誉攸关的大事。她不再剪发，当头发留到足够长，便由其他少女为她把头发分成几绺再编成一根根小麻花辫。这位初涉尘世的豆蔻少女，以极大的庄严和自豪，让自己全身心臣服于所有风俗礼仪，不管是否艰难。能感觉到，她宁可死，也不愿在谨守妇道方面有所亏欠。

法拉告诉我：老太太，他的岳母，在她的故乡，因教女有方而享有美誉。在当地，她们就是闺范的楷模，少女们的镜鉴。确实如此，这三位年轻的姐妹，都金尊玉贵，举止淑雅。我从不曾见过比她们更具淑女风范的大小姐。而她们的着装又更衬托了她们的少女娴静。她们都身穿宽裥裙，据我所知——因为我经常帮她们买丝绸或印花棉布——一条裙子要耗费十米布料。在布料的重重叠叠之下，她们纤细的双膝以一种不为人知的韵律轻移慢步。

你那高贵的双腿，踢起了裙边，

折磨着暗中的情欲，如熬如煎，

犹如两个巫婆晃摇

一个深瓶子里的黑色媚药。(2)



老母亲本人的外形也颇具不怒而威的气度，矮矮胖胖，有一种母象般的大权在握，深知自己的力量所在，反而呈现出母仪天下的慈蔼平和。我不曾见她大发雷霆过。教士和老师们应当嫉妒她身上激励人心的感染力；在她手中，教育不是强制，也并非苦工，而是伟大崇高的同心大业，能得到她的教诲，是一种荣耀。我为他们在林间建造的这座小房子，乃是一所关于白魔法(3)的小学校，三个年轻姑娘在房子周边的羊肠小道上轻步缓行，仿佛三位正在竭尽所能发奋学习的少女巫师，一待学徒期满，将具有强大威力。她们性情相投，同时在德行上各呈异彩。很可能她们将被置于真实的交易场，并且被自由竞价，竞争既公开又诚实。法拉的太太则像一位已经学业有成的巫术优等生，处于超然境地，无需再猜度自身价格了；人们会看到她自信满满地与巫术老首领(4)攀谈。此类殊荣，还不曾落到未婚少女们头上。

所有的少女都自矜身份，自视甚高。穆斯林闺秀绝不能下嫁，这会令其门楣蒙羞。男人可以下娶——这对他们已经足够——我们已经知道，索马里小伙子是娶马赛女人为妻的。索马里姑娘可以嫁到阿拉伯半岛，阿拉伯姑娘可不能嫁到索马里兰，因为阿拉伯人是优秀种族，与先知穆罕默德有千丝万缕的联系，而且，在阿拉伯人内部，穆罕默德家族的姑娘们也是不能外嫁其他家族的。基于性别的特质，该民族的少女们坚持要上嫁、要高攀。索马里人很重视牝马，故而他们理直气壮地把这一规则同培养纯种赛马的育马场法则相提并论。

待到我们熟识之后，姑娘们问我：是否传闻属实，欧洲有些民族嫁女时对新郎一无所求。她们甚至还听说过，但她们简直理解不了：有个民族居然自甘堕落到女儿出嫁时还要倒贴嫁妆。呀呸，这样的父母和闺女，让人如此作践，真是丧尽颜面。他们的自尊心哪里去了？他们对妇女、对黄花闺女的敬意在哪里？姑娘们告诉我，设若不幸落胎到这样的民族，她们将矢志独身终老。

在欧洲的那些时日，我没有机会深研闺秀式文雅守礼的技巧，从旧书上也不曾捕捉住它的无穷魅力。此刻我明白了我的祖父和曾祖父们是如何心悦诚服、俯首称臣的。索马里的体系，在过去，是自然的需求和优美的艺术，既是宗教，也是谋略，更是舞蹈，被人们怀着挚爱、严守规则同时机变百出地在方方面面实践着。它最大的恩慈，乃在于其本身内部自相冲突的力量。在铁面斥责的不变原则背后，藏着无尽的慷慨包容；假正经背后是风趣乐观，是对死亡的浑不在乎。这些好战民族的女儿表现一本正经的大礼风范，正如她们跳起优美的战舞。她们看去都茹素，连黄油都算荤物不会轻舔一口，事实上在搏斗中，不饮尽敌人心头最后一滴血，永不会罢休。她们是三只披着羊皮的美丽残暴的年轻小母狼。索马里人都是铁打出来的，在海上，在沙漠中，历尽艰险。生命的重负、艰苦的压力、惊涛骇浪和无尽岁月，共同把索马里妇女打造成了如此坚硬、如此光芒四射的琥珀。

女人们在墙上挂了许多挂毯和绣幕，令法拉的家有一种游牧民族的气质，似乎随时可能撤帐而走。熏香对他们来说是家中不可或缺的。许多索马里香都芳香扑鼻。农场岁月里通常几乎见不到女性。我渐渐养成习惯，每日终了，在法拉家里，与老太太和姑娘们静静对坐一两个小时。

她们对什么都兴趣浓厚，再小的事都能让她们兴高采烈。农场上的小意外、本地的趣闻笑话，都能引她们哈哈大笑，屋子里仿佛响彻铃铛的叮咚声。当我教她们打毛衣的时候，她们笑翻了，好像是在观看滑稽木偶剧。

她们纯真无邪，却并不无知。婴儿诞生，家有丧事，她们都会去做帮手，事后还与老母亲冷静地讨论细节。有时，为了让我高兴，她们会讲述《一千零一夜》式的故事，绝大多数都是滑稽风俗故事，有很直白的爱情描写。共同特点是：每个里面都有巾帼女杰，不管是否贞节烈女，都比男主角聪明要强，最终一定结局圆满。老母亲坐在一边听着，脸上浮起隐隐的笑意。

在这个封闭的女性世界里，可以这么说，在高墙和男权的铜墙铁壁之下，我意识到了一种伟大理想的存在，如果没有这个，其实也就不消护花骑士们如此大无畏地戒备森严；这是关于女性君临天下、盛世太平的理想。这种时候，老母亲会呈现出全新的模样，她端坐如踞宝座，如一尊全知全能的女神塑像，身躯庞大漆黑，在先知们所说的神出现之前很久很久，她已经存在。对于她，原住民们从不曾忘记。但他们都是务实的人，着眼于当下的需要，也为将来的资源做好无尽的准备。

年轻姑娘们对欧洲风俗百般好奇，对白人妇女的举止风度、教育和服饰的描述，都听得全神贯注，仿佛要用异邦男人如何倾倒、如何被征服的经验，完成她们的御夫战略指南。

她们的着装在生活中占据了举足轻重的位置，这毫不奇怪，因为对于她们来说，所有这些服饰都是军备物资，是战利品，是凯旋的标志，类似胜者手中败军之将的旗帜。她们的丈夫，索马里男人们，对自然界的一切都寡淡无欲，无论是美食、美酒抑或个人享受。他们的寒冷荒凉一如他们故国的贫瘠，女人是他们所有的奢侈品。对她们，他们贪得无厌，欲壑难填，她们就是他们生命中的尽善尽美。马、骆驼和畜群固然也是他们所愿，但永远不可能超过妻子的地位。索马里妻子们同时激励丈夫的这两种特性。她们残忍地嘲笑男人身上任何一丝软弱，不惜做出巨大的自我牺牲，以抬高身价。除非通过男人，这些女人连一双拖鞋都得不到，她们无法自行其是，必须依附于某个男性，父亲、兄弟或者丈夫，尽管如此，她们依然是生活中的最高奖项，值得争取。令人惊异的是，为了男女双方面上有光，索马里妇人们向她们的男人索取了多少丝绸、黄金、琥珀、珊瑚。漫长艰难的贸易远征，无限甘苦、历险，谋略及忍耐也被消耗到了极限，全变成了女子们的云裳。少女们没有男人可榨取，在她们小小的、帐篷似的香闺里，梳理云鬓，一心盼着时刻来临，将征服那征服者，豪夺那豪夺者。她们都很擅长彼此借穿华服，也乐于帮小妹妹——姐妹中最鹤立鸡群的美人儿——盛装打扮，给她穿上已婚姐姐们最好的衣服，甚至大笑着，让她戴上姐姐们金缕线的头饰——没出门子的姑娘是不允许戴这种东西的。

索马里人热衷于诉讼，对积怨念念不忘，法拉几乎就没清静过，总有案子，每次都需要他频繁前往内罗毕出庭，或者在农场召开部落会议。这种时候，我每次去他家，老太太总婉转精明地对我旁敲侧击，想知道案子的进展。她多半已经问过法拉，后者应该原原本本对她说过，因为他对她一向尊敬有加。我认为，她并非仅仅是运用外交策略，而是想得到另一方面的信息。以这种方式，她能保持一种或许更切合她的身份——女人对男性事务的茫然无知，男人嘴里说的话，做女人的不懂一字半句。如果她有什么真知灼见，势必得以神谕的方式表达，天赐箴言，激励人心，永远无人会追究她的责任，要她负责。

农场上，每逢索马里人的大型聚会，或者重大的宗教庆典，要布置会场，准备食物，女人们有很多可忙。宴会上没有她们的一席之地，她们也不得进入清真寺，但她们莫不满怀雄心，想把聚会办得成功辉煌，而心里到底是怎么想这件事，即使在自己人之间，她们也绝口不提。这种时候，她们总是强烈地让我想起家乡的老一代妇女们，我脑海中，浮现出她们身着裙撑、拖着窄窄裙褶的身影。我母亲以及祖母那一辈的北欧妇女——良善的野蛮人的文明奴隶们——在那些如火如荼的、只有男人参与的神圣盛会上——比如猎锦鸡和秋季大狩猎——难道不是一样，恪尽职守，尽女主人之谊吗？

索马里人世世代代蓄养奴隶，索马里女人与原住民相处融洽，和原住民在一道时，既漫不经心又心平气和。对原住民来说，索马里人和阿拉伯人没有白人那么难伺候，毕竟无论世界各地，有色人种的生活节拍都相同。法拉的太太在农场上就很受基库尤人喜爱，卡曼特多次跟我说，她很聪明。

对我那些频频到访且在农场小住的白人朋友，诸如伯克利·科尔和丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿，年轻的索马里姑娘们都很友善，经常提起他们，对他们的情况知之甚多，详细得让人意外。每次相遇，她们都会把双手插在裙摆的褶皱里，与他们聊上几句，口气仿佛他们的姐姐妹妹。但伯克利和丹尼斯都有索马里仆人，而他们是这些姑娘们终其一生都不能与之碰面的。一旦贾玛或者比利阿包着头巾、清瘦黑眸的形象出现在农场上，我的索马里姑娘们就立刻无影无踪，她们消失的地方，连水泡都不会泛起一个。如果这期间她们想来拜访我，会蹑手蹑脚地绕过墙角，撩起一块裙摆遮住脸孔。英国先生们说，他们很高兴被如此信任。但我相信，在他们心底上，想到自己竟被视为完全无害，必定会有一阵冷风飕飕刮得他们透心凉。

有时我带姑娘们出门兜风或者做客，总是小心地请示老母亲：这合适吗？我不能玷污她们月神狄安娜面庞般冰清玉洁的名声。我农场一侧住着一位澳大利亚少妇，几年来一直是我的好邻居。她会邀请索马里姑娘们喝茶，这可真是桩盛事。她们大肆装扮，艳若捧花，我驾车前往的路上，在我身后——车的后部——叽叽喳喳声一路不绝，宛如一间鸟舍。她们对每事每物都大惊小怪，房子、服饰，甚至我朋友的丈夫——远远看到他在骑马或者犁地的时候。茶端上来，只有已婚姐姐和小女孩能够享用，未婚少女不得饮用，因为茶有刺激性。只能饷之以蛋糕，对此她们欣然接受，吃相文文静静。关于那位和我们生活在一起的小姑娘，有小小的讨论——她还能喝茶吗，抑或她已到达人所共知的高危之龄？已婚姐姐认为她可以喝，但这孩子向我们投来骄傲的深深一瞥，拒绝了递过去的茶杯。

那位表妹是个多愁善感的女孩，双眼呈红褐色，能读阿拉伯文，熟记并能背诵一些《古兰经》的篇章。她颇有神学头脑，跟我讨论过很多次宗教，也时常谈及世界上的诸般奇迹。从她那里，我才领悟了约瑟和波提乏之妻故事的真实用意(5)。她能接受耶稣基督为处女产子，却不认为他是上帝之子，因为上帝不可能有一个血肉之躯的儿子。圣母马利亚是最蒙主恩宠的童女，在花园散步时，上苍派来的一位大天使翅翼轻触过她的肩头，她就此受孕。讨论到了最后，一天，我给她看一张图画明信片，印着哥本哈根大教堂里托瓦尔森(6)制作的耶稣圣像。她立刻一见钟情，对救世主耶稣爱得既温柔又狂热。他的事，她怎么也听不够，我讲的时候，她时悲时喜，发出长长的叹息。她对犹大格外关注——他是什么样的人，世间怎么会有这样的人？如果能亲手抠出他的眼珠子，才是称心快事。这是一种伟大的激情，一如她们每日房中的焚香味道。那香是远山乌木所制，香气袭人，对我们的嗅觉来说神秘曼妙之极。

我问法国神父们，我能不能带我家这些年轻的穆斯林妇女到教堂去。他们欣然应允，态度友善亲热——他们很高兴有事发生。一天下午，我们驱车前往，一个接一个，庄严地走进阴凉的教堂。这些年轻女子从不曾置身于这般琼楼玉宇，当她们抬头瞻望，不由得举手挡住头顶，害怕屋顶会垮下来砸在她们头上。教堂里也有圣像，除了在明信片上，她们有生之年还从不曾见过这样的塑像。在法国天主教传教团里，有一尊真人等大的圣母像，身穿白衣，外披淡蓝袍子，手持一朵百合花，在她身侧，是怀中抱着圣婴的圣约瑟。女孩们在圣像面前被震撼得瞠目结舌，圣母之美令她们目不转睛。她们已经知晓一二圣约瑟的事迹，对他赞不绝口，因为他是圣母的合法丈夫和保护者。现在她们更是满怀谢意地凝望着他，因为他正在帮太太抱孩子。法拉的太太当时正在备孕，我们待在教堂里的时候，她全程都离圣母一家很近。神父们很为自己的教堂纸窗骄傲，虽是纸制，却仿效彩绘玻璃，绘制再现了基督降生的场面。小表妹对这些彩窗无限倾心，神魂颠倒，她在教堂里走来走去，双眼始终紧盯着它们，双手用力直绞，双膝不由自主地弯曲，仿佛置身于十字架的重压下。回家路上她们极少开腔，我觉得，她们是害怕问出贻笑大方的问题，流露出自身的无知。不过几天后，她们问我，神父们能不能让圣母或者圣约瑟从底座上走下来。

小表妹是从农场出嫁的，婚礼在一座漂亮的小屋里举行。这座小屋当时闲置，于是我借给索马里人供此类场合使用。婚礼浩繁盛大，持续了七天之久。我出席了最重要的大典，现场有一队女傧相，一边吟唱一边引领新娘向前，与另一队同声合唱的男傧相会合，把他们引领的新郎交到她手里。那之前，她还不曾见过他。我不由思忖，她是否曾照着托瓦尔森耶稣基督的模样想象他的脸容，抑或她宁愿有两个心上人，一个属于天国，另一个属于俗世，就像那些浪漫的骑士小说里面一样。这一星期里，我不止一次驱车前往。无论何时抵达，都会发现屋里到处喜气洋洋，飘荡着婚礼特有的熏香味道。男人的剑舞、女人的曼妙舞姿，使现场热闹非凡；老人们在谈大笔的牲畜交易，花炮齐鸣，城里来的骡车来来往往。到了晚上，廊上防风灯全燃，在灯火的映照下，各种阿拉伯及索马里最耀人眼目的彩衣色泽进房出房，上车下车：淡红、纯李子红、苏丹褐、孟加拉玫瑰红和藏红花红。

法拉的儿子艾哈迈德在农场出生，大家都叫他“索非”，我猜是锯的意思。他的天性里头没有一丝一毫基库尤孩子的胆小羞怯。当他还是个小婴儿，被包得严严实实，像枚橡果，除了黑黑的圆脑袋之外，几乎露不出身体的其他部位。那时他就会坐得笔直，脸对脸地盯着人看：像一只被你捧在手上的鹰雏，抱在膝上的幼狮。他遗传了母亲的乐观天性，当他能够四处乱跑的时候，长成了个小小冒险家，成天兴高采烈。在农场上原住民孩子的世界里，他也算得个呼风唤雨的大人物。

老努森


有时候，欧洲来客们一头栽进农场，像船难后，木板随波逐流来到静静的水域，翻滚着，转动着，直到最后或者被激流冲走，或者完全被洪潮吞噬，永沉水底。

老努森，丹麦人，来农场时病弱失明，像一只孤独的兽，退居在此直到死亡将他带走。他曾经的不幸遭遇令他走在路上都直不起腰；他会很长一段时间一声不出，他背负的苦痛太沉重，耗尽了全部的力气。而一旦开口，他的声音就像狼嚎或者鬣狗的嘶鸣，本身就是哀号。

但当他康复，有一阵子浑身上下无病无痛，死灰便会再次火星迸射。他会跑来向我细述，他如何不得不与天性中致命的抑郁病根做斗争，这荒谬的倾向令他眼中的一切都是黑色的。这没什么道理可言，因为外界环境并没有悖乱，不应该被唾弃，是魔鬼在他身上作了怪。纯粹的厌世情绪，厌世——才真是罪魁祸首！

那段日子，农场生涯比往年还要贫窘，正是努森建议我烧炭卖给内罗毕的印度人。他肯定地跟我说，能有上千卢比的利润。在老努森的全力支持下，绝不会功败垂成，因为在他动荡的岁月里，有一度，他曾经到过瑞典的最北端，在那里将这门技艺掌握得应手得心。他自告奋勇指导原住民学习烧炭工艺。我们就此开始并肩在林中工作，那期间，我与他聊了很多。

烧炭是一桩愉快的工作。毫无疑问，其中有令人陶醉的成分。众所周知，烧炭人看待问题的视角与众不同。他们惯于吟诗或者吹些无伤大雅的小牛，林中魔(1)总与他们同在。当完成燃烧，打开窑门后，内容物四散在地，窑中的成品就是美丽的炭。丝般光滑，析去杂质，减去重量，从此不朽，成为历尽沧桑、黑色的小小木质木乃伊。

烧炭艺术的场景调度让人乐在其中，趣味无限。只砍伐矮树丛——因为厚重木材不能用来制炭——在参天大树的树冠下，我们安静地作业。非洲森林，万籁俱寂，绿荫蔽日，砍下来的木头散发着醋栗的清香，正在燃烧的炭窑，浓浓的味道扑鼻而来，新鲜热辣，又臭又腥，如海风般令人精神一振。就在天赤道(2)的正下方，这个没有戏剧的地方，工地上却有一种剧场般的氛围，呈现着无穷魅力。炉窑喷出的薄薄淡蓝烟圈总是升到差不多相同的高度上，黑色炉窑自身恰似舞台上搭起的帐篷；此地像是一出浪漫爱情戏剧里走私贩子或者兵丁安营扎寨。原住民黑色的身影在舞台上无声地穿行。在非洲森林里，矮树丛被砍净的地方，会有许多许多的蝴蝶聚集在你眼前，仿佛密密簇集在树桩上的花朵。一切都那么神奇，又如此无瑕。置身其间，瘦弱扭曲的老努森与周遭环境竟无比协调。顶着一头红发的他，身影忽隐忽现，矫健灵巧，现在他终于找到一桩梦寐以求的事业可以投身，能够笑傲众生，激情四射，像一个已经又老又瞎的小精灵，照样愤世嫉俗。对工作，他尽心尽力，对原住民徒工们，也耐心得出人意料。我们的想法并不总是一致。少女时期我曾在巴黎进过一所绘画学校，在那里学到，橄榄木能制出最好的木炭，但努森向我陈情：橄榄木上没有节瘤，而他，以地狱里七千恶魔之名起誓，人人都晓得，树木的灵魂就在它们的节瘤里。

林间的特殊环境令努森的暴脾气柔和下来。非洲树木叶片纤细，绝大多数是指状的。当你砍净丰厚的矮树丛，换言之挖空了森林后，这里的光影，便非常像五月时分。在故乡山毛榉林中，彼时叶片刚刚绽放或者即将绽放。我提醒努森注意到这相似处，他很开心，于是在整个烧炭过程中，他始终有一个绮想，且将之发扬光大：我们正在丹麦，在五旬节(3)野游。一棵中空的老树被他命名为洛腾博格，这是哥本哈根近郊一家游乐场的名字。我曾经在洛腾博格深处藏了几瓶丹麦啤酒，当我邀请他来喝一杯的时候，他屈尊接受了，当这是一个可爱的玩笑。

所有炉窑点着后，我们坐下来开始谈论人生。关于努森的过去，我所知甚详——那些他流浪之处，那些不幸落在他身上的种种惊世骇俗的冒险。这种谈话中，你必须谈论老努森本人，那位正直的人——或者你会陷入他警告过你的黑暗厌世。许多事他一一遍历：海难、瘟疫、色彩无以名状的鱼、酒泉、井喷、三个太阳同时当空、背信弃义的朋友、深沉的罪孽、转瞬即逝的成功以及刹那间云散雨收的黄金雨。一种强烈的感情贯穿于他的奥德赛流浪之旅中，就是对法律——包括一切法律所言、一切法律所为——的不屑一顾。他生有反骨，每一位不法之徒都是他的同志。对他来说，所谓英雄行为本身，就是指无法无天的行径。他喜欢谈论国王、王室、江湖艺人、侏儒和疯子，认为他们都能超越法律制约——也包括任何犯罪、革命、诡计、戏谑，在法律制裁面前都能逃之夭夭。对于良民，他有根深蒂固的嗤之以鼻的心理，任何人的奉公守法在他看来，都是一种奴性意识。他对物理定律毫不重视，甚至根本不以为然，这是我们一同伐树时我发现的：在襟怀坦荡且魅力十足的人手里，他看不出有什么理由不能使得物理定律反其道而行之。

努森很乐于把他认识的各色人等的名字都一一印到我脑海，尤其是骗子和小人。但在他的讲述中，一次也不曾提及女性的名字。仿佛时光把埃尔西诺(4)的甜妞儿和天涯海角港口上的冷酷荡妇们都从他脑海里一扫而空。但当我与他倾谈时，我感觉到，在他生命中，有一位不知名的女子亘古长存。我说不出来她可能是谁：太太、母亲、小学女校长，或者他第一位老板娘——在我的想象中，我称她为努森夫人。我猜想她五短身材，因为他自己也这么个子矮小。她会毁掉男人所有的乐趣，且永远正确。她是在枕边对男人训斥不休的太太，永远都在大扫除的主妇，她阻挠他的宏图大业，每天光忙着给孩子们洗脸，把男人面前桌上的金酒(5)统统扫到地上，她就是活生生的法律和戒条。她宣称自己有百分百的权力，这方面，她与索马里妇人们的圣母有些许相似之处，但努森夫人从不梦想因爱情而被臣服，她管理这个男人，只凭着天经地义以及理直气壮。

努森一定是在很年轻的时候遇见她，那时他的心肠还柔软，还能留下永不磨灭的痕迹。他从她身边逃开，直奔大海，因为她讨厌海，无法前来，但一旦登上非洲的海岸线，他就躲不掉了，她与他形影不离。在他狂野的内心，在他泛白的红发下面，他惧惮她，远胜过害怕任何男人，而且怀疑世上所有女人其实都是努森夫人，只是乔装改扮。

我们的烧炭大业最终没有获利。隔三岔五，会有某个炉窑起火，我们的利润就随着轻烟一道冉冉飞升。努森本人对我们的失败耿耿于怀，苦思冥想后，他宣布：除非近处有雪封三尺，否则世上无人能烧出炭来。

努森还帮我在农场挖了一个池塘。农场大路要经过一个碗口状的洼地，野草蔓生，内有泉眼。我打算在泉下筑起堤坝，把这里变成一个湖泊。非洲常常缺水，家畜能在农场饮水，就避免了去河边的漫漫路途，对它们很有好处。日日夜夜，建坝的事情萦绕在全农场人心中，得到了热烈讨论；当它最终大功告成，对所有人来说都是辉煌大业。水坝有六十米长。老努森对此出力最多，他还教普莱·辛格制作水坝舀子。水坝刚建成时，我们天天为之手忙脚乱，因为长长的旱季过后，雨季到来，它却存不住水；有几处不断崩坏，还有半边坝不止一次被冲垮。是老努森坚持要依靠牲畜们的踩踏，来加固土木工程。无论何时，农场公牛和棚民们的家畜到塘边喝水，都要赶过来从水坝上踩过。山羊和绵羊也参与进来共襄盛举，在地基上踩过。为这事，他与几个小牧牛娃几乎血战，因为老努森坚持要牛群缓步走过，但调皮的孩子们却希望它们一溜烟跑过去，在空中拍打着尾巴。最后，我站在老努森一边，他赢过了孩子们。于是长长的牛群行列安然地、步伐整齐地踱过窄窄的堤坝，它们的形象衬在天幕上，犹如挪亚的动物行列步入方舟；老努森本人一一点数着它们，拐杖支在胳膊正方，看去像造船人挪亚真身，想象着众人即将淹死，唯自己可活，心甚满足。

过了一段时间，我终于在农场上有了一片广阔的水域，而且有的地方水深可达两米。大路从塘边经过，景色如画。过后，我们甚至还在较低处修了两个水坝，并以这种方式，建成了一列水塘。它们就像项链上的珍珠。池塘现在成为了农场的中心。那里总是生机勃勃，孩子们和牲畜在池边围成一圈。炎热时日里，山间和平原上的水池干涸，鸟儿们就飞到农场：苍鹭、朱鹭、翠鸟、鹌鹑，还有十几种野鹅和野鸭。晚上，当第一颗星星在天际闪现，我经常走出屋坐在塘边。此刻，鸟儿们归入巢中。其他鸟类的飞行大多有目的，水鸟不一样，它们总是在旅途中，总是从某地转向另一地——这些野生游泳健将的目力实在惊人！野鸭在明如镜的天幕上兜着圈子，突然一头扎到暗色的水中，一无声息，仿佛是被空中箭弩射出的许多支箭头。有一次，我在池塘里开枪打死了一只鳄鱼。这可真是咄咄怪事，它一定是从阿西河长途跋涉了二十千米才抵达此地。它是怎么知道这里现在有水了呢？它可从来没来过。

第一个水塘大功告成的时候，努森与我商量要在池塘里投放鱼苗。非洲有一种鲈鱼，味道很美，我们有心在农场里养鲈鱼，对此计划念念难舍。但是要找到鱼苗，并非易事，野生动物部在一些池塘里投下了鱼苗，但禁止任何人捕捞。然而努森向我保证：他知晓一个无人踏足过的池塘，在那里我们想要多少鱼就能捕到多少鱼。他说，我们可以开车前往，在塘中撒网，再把鱼装在水罐和水缸里，用车带回来，这样鱼儿能保证成活，只要我们记得在水中投放水草饲料。对此计划他无限心醉，向我深入描述的时候，甚至激动得颤抖起来，还用手比划出一条无与伦比的渔网。但当探险的时间逼近，这件事却愈发像是他在故弄玄虚。此行动，他坚持说，必须要在满月之夜，午夜时分。起初我们打算带三个仆人，之后他却把仆人数目缩减成两个，再减到一个，还频频问我：那人是否绝对可靠？到最后，他宣布：他与我两人单独前去比较好。我认为这可行不通，因为我们俩可无法把水罐扛到车里，但努森坚持说这是最佳方案，还补充道：不要告诉任何人。

我在野生动物部有朋友，此刻我再也控制不住，不得不问他：“努森，我们准备去捕的这些鱼，到底是谁家的？”努森一个字也没有回答。他啐了一口，一种标准老水手的吐痰方式——探出他穿在破烂补丁鞋里的脚，擦掉了地上的痰迹后，他转过身，慢慢地、如丧考妣地走了出去。他走着，头埋得很低，低到两肩之间，那时他已经完全看不见了，只能在身前用拐杖探摸，他又一次成为被击败的人，一个无家可归的逃亡者，在这个粗俗冰冷的世界上。仿佛他正以身形做出宣告，站在他留下的污迹前的我，正是战无不胜的努森夫人。

养鱼工程，我与努森都不曾再提起过。只是，他去世后不久，我在野生动物部的协助下，在池塘里放了鲈鱼。它们在这里繁衍生息，兴旺发达，以冷静沉着、无声无息又活泼好动的脾性给池塘里增添了无限生机。日中时分，路经池塘，会看见它们聚得离水面很近，阳光下，水中波光涟漪，形影朦胧，它们宛如墨玉制成。如果有客人意外到访，大宅的僮仆图门博经常被打发到池塘来，用一根简陋的渔竿钓一条一公斤多重的鲈鱼来待客。

当发现老努森倒卧在农场道路上，已经过世时，我派了一个跑腿人去内罗毕警察局报告情况。本打算把他埋葬在农场上，但当天深夜，两位警官乘车抵达，随身携一具棺材带走了他。就在此时，一场暴风雨突然铺天盖地降临，积水很快达到八十毫米，这还仅仅是雨季的开始。我们在急流和水帘间，驱车前往他的住处。当我们抬出努森的遗体上车时，雷声轰轰有如炮声，滚过头顶，四面八方都是雪亮的闪电，密集有如麦田里的麦穗。车上没装防滑链，几乎无法行驶，总是不断从道路一侧摆向另一侧。老努森应该会喜欢这样，对自己的农场生涯终于能画上句号，想必他很满意。

后来，关于他的丧葬事宜，我与内罗毕市政当局意见不合，随即发展成白热化的争执，我不得不几次为这事进城。这是努森给我的遗嘱，是他通过我这个代理人给法律脸上的最后一记重拳。于是我不再是努森夫人，而变成他的好兄弟。

流浪者农场小住


有一位旅人到过农场，只睡了一晚就走了，再也没回来过，我却不时想起他。他名叫伊曼纽生，是一个瑞典人。初遇的时候，他在内罗毕的一家酒店做侍应领班。他是个小胖的年轻人，红扑扑的面包脸，我在酒店用餐时，他习惯侍立在我椅旁，用一种油腻腻的口气和我聊天，谈及遥远的故国以及当地我们共同认识的熟人；他实在太健谈，没过多久，我只好换到城里当时仅有的第二家酒店吃饭。之后，我只是模模糊糊听到一些伊曼纽生的消息：他似乎天生就会惹麻烦上身，而且在品味以及寻找人生乐趣等方面总与大家伙儿格格不入。所以他很不受其他北欧人欢迎。一天下午，他突然现身农场，惊恐万状，颠三倒四，向我借一笔钱，为了能立刻出发去坦噶尼喀(1)，要不然他就会被抓到牢里去。可能我的援助来得太迟，也可能伊曼纽生把钱乱花在其他事上了，反正不久之后，我听说他在内罗毕被捕。他没有坐牢，但是有一段时间，他从我的视野里消失了。

一天晚上，我骑马回家，天色已晚，有星在天，远远瞥见屋外石堆上，一个人在等我。是伊曼纽生。他用一种亲切熟络的口气介绍自己：“来了一位流浪者，男爵夫人。”我问他怎么了，为什么会在这里看到他，他跟我说他迷路了，所以只能投奔我这里。是去哪里的路？坦噶尼喀。

这太扯了——通往坦噶尼喀的路是宽阔的康庄大道，很容易找，而通往我农场的小路只是它的分支。他打算怎么去坦噶尼喀，我问。他宣布，步行。我答道，步行对任何人来说都不太可行，这将意味着用三天时间穿越干旱缺水的马赛人居留区，而且当下该地有狮子出没。就在这一天，马赛人向我抱怨过狮群为患，央求我前往射杀。

是的，是的，伊曼纽生全晓得这些，但他还是打算徒步前往坦噶尼喀。因为他不知道还能做些什么。他现在流落到了此地，迷失路径，恳请我在农场上与他一起吃个饭，并容他一夜好睡。他第二天一大清晨就会出发——如果我不方便，他现在就可以启程，趁那星光正璀璨。

跟他说话的时候，我一直坐在马上没有下来，借此向他强调：他不请自来，非我宾客，我不打算与他共进晚餐。但当他开了口，我看出来，他根本就没指望被邀请，对我的好客程度及自己的说服力，他都没信心。在屋外的幽暗里，他只是一个孤单单的剪影，在这世上一个朋友也没有。他嘻嘻哈哈的态度，不是为了自己的面子——那个他早已置之不理，而是给我面子。仿佛如果我现在打发他滚蛋，也并非无情无义，而是理当固然。穷鸟入怀，猎人不杀——我叫来马夫牵住马绳，自己翻身下马。“进来吧，伊曼纽生，”我说，“你可以在这里吃饭过夜。”

灯光下，伊曼纽生的样子令人心酸。他穿着黑色长大衣，非洲根本没人穿这样的衣服，胡子没刮，头发没剪，看上去蓬头垢面，穿着一双破鞋，鞋尖张着大口子。他要去坦噶尼喀，却双手空空，身边什么东西也没带。仿佛我要扮演祭司的角色，向上帝献祭一头送至荒郊野地的活羔羊。我觉得眼下需要喝杯酒。伯克利·科尔通常都在我家存一些酒，不久前还送了我一箱非常稀有的勃艮第葡萄酒，此刻我吩咐朱玛从中开一瓶。我们坐定用餐，伊曼纽生品过半杯酒，举杯向灯，专注凝望了一会儿，仿佛在全神聆听音乐。“棒极了，”他说，“绝佳，1906年出品的香贝丹酒。”如此这般，我对伊曼纽生刮目相看。

除此之外，他很少主动开口，我也不知道该跟他说什么好。我问他，他根本找不到工作，到底怎么回事儿。他答：这是因为他对本地职场的各种工作岗位都一窍不通。酒店解雇他，也缘于他不是一个真的侍应生领班。

“你会记账吗？”我问。

“不，完全不会，”他说，“要把两个数相加，我总觉得很吃力。”

“那你对牲畜知道多少？”我接着问。“牛？”他反问，“不，不。我怕牛。”

“那你能开拖拉机吗？”我问。一丝微弱的希望之光浮现在他脸上。“不能，”他说，“但我想我可以学。”

“但别用我的拖拉机学，”我说，“不过告诉我，伊曼纽生，你原来是做什么的？你究竟是什么职业？”

伊曼纽生顿时坐得笔直。“我是什么职业？”他大声说，“怎么说呢，我是个演员。”

我不禁想到：感谢上帝，我已经尽力，但用任何切实可行的方式帮助这迷途羔羊，非我所能。于是谈话进入了随便聊聊的阶段。“你是演员？”我说，“真不错。哪一个角色是你最拿手的？”

“哦，我是悲剧演员，”伊曼纽生说，“我最擅长的角色是《茶花女》里的阿芒和《群鬼》(2)里的欧士华。”

我们谈了一会儿这几部戏，以及一些亲见过的演员，又对他们的演技发表了一下高见。伊曼纽生环视房间，问道：“你可能没什么机会在这边观看亨里克·易卜生的戏剧演出吧？我们可以一起扮演《群鬼》的最后一幕，只要你不介意饰演阿尔文太太(3)。”

我手边没有易卜生的剧本。

“但也许你还记得台词？”伊曼纽生为自己的计划激动着，“我能背诵欧士华的全部台词，从头到尾。最后一幕最精彩。真正的悲剧效果，你知道，不可抗拒。”

此刻已是繁星满天，夜色温暖迷人，雨季近在咫尺。我问伊曼纽生：他真打算徒步走到坦噶尼喀吗？

“是的，”他说，“现在，我要为自己鼓劲。”

“你没结婚，对你来说，倒是个好事儿。”我说。

“是呀，”他说，“没错。”过了一会儿，他不好意思地加了一句，“不过我结婚了。”

在谈话当中，伊曼纽生抱怨说，此地白种人几乎无法单枪匹马同原住民竞争，后者工资低太多了。“而在巴黎，”他说，“我总能在很短的时间内，就在一些咖啡馆什么的地方找到侍应工作。”

“为什么你不留在巴黎呢，伊曼纽生？”我问他。

他眸子一闪，瞟我一眼。“巴黎？”他说，“不不，真的。我可是在千钧一发的当口逃离巴黎的。”

那晚伊曼纽生多次提起：在世界某一处有他一位朋友。只要能联系到这位朋友，万事就会大变样了，因为那人既富甲天下又慷慨仗义，是个魔术师，时常在世界各地漫游。伊曼纽生最后一次听说他的消息时，魔术师是在旧金山。

我们时而聊聊文学，时而谈起戏剧，最后话题还是回到伊曼纽生的前途上。他告诉我，在非洲这里，他的同胞们是如何一个接一个把他赶出门去。

“你处境艰难哪，伊曼纽生。”我说，“我真不知道我还能想出谁比你现在更困难。”

“是呀，我自己也这么觉得。”他说，“不过最近我想通了一件事，可能你还没想过：总得有人，不是张三就是李四，是全天下混得最惨的那一个。”

他饮尽杯中酒，把酒杯稍微推开一点。“这趟旅程，”他说，“对我来说相当于红黑棋(4)，成败在此一举，吉凶随缘。这是我脱离困境的机会，甚至能摆脱一切烦恼忧愁。另一方面看来，如果我到了坦噶尼喀，多少都能有些转机。”

“我认为你能到坦噶尼喀，”我说，“路上有印度人的货车来往，你可以搭一程便车。”

“是的，不过那里有狮子，”伊曼纽生说，“还有马赛人。”

“你信奉上帝吗，伊曼纽生？”我问他。

“是的，是的，是的。”伊曼纽生连声说道，他静静地坐了一会儿，“如果我现在把心里话说出来，也许你会觉得我是一个糟透了的怀疑论者。不过除了上帝以外我什么都不信。”

“嗨，听着，伊曼纽生，”我说，“你身上有钱吗？”

“是的，我有，”他说，“八十分。”

“那不够，”我说，“我自己在家里也没有现金。不过法拉可能有。”法拉有四卢比。

第二天早上，太阳还没升起，我吩咐仆人叫醒伊曼纽生，并给我们做早饭。昨天晚上，我想到我应该开车载他一程，走个二十千米。这对伊曼纽生并无大补，因为他还有一百三十千米路要一步一步走出来，可我总不能眼看他以我门口为起点，走向不可知的未来。此刻，不管他上演的是悲剧还是喜剧，我多少希望能装扮登场，助他一臂之力。我为他打了一个包，白煮硬心蛋和三明治，还有一瓶1906年出品的香贝丹酒，既然他赞赏不已。我担心这会是他此生的最后一饮了。

在曙光中，伊曼纽生看上去像传说中的僵尸，胡须在土壤里长得飞快(5)，此刻欣欣然破坟而出。我们坐在车上的时候，他始终心平气和，举止得当。过了姆巴加地河后，我让他下了车。早晨空气清新，万里无云。他向西南方向走去。我回首眺望背后的地平线，朝阳恰在此时冉冉升起，暗暗的红：我想，真像白煮硬心蛋的蛋黄。三四个小时后，它将会燃起炽热白焰，在旅行者的头顶上烈不可当。

伊曼纽生对我说了一句“再见”。他上路了，又回到我身边，再说了一次“再见”。我坐在车里望着他，因为当他一路远行，也许会因旁观者的存在而欣慰。我坚信他身上那戏剧化的本能如斯强烈，使得他此时此刻触景生情地自觉在离开舞台，仿佛他变成旁观者，目送自己离去。伊曼纽生退场了。难道山川、金合欢树和尘土飞扬的大道，不再为他哀叹，并在转瞬之间，扮演了布景板的形象？

晨风薄凉，黑色长大衣下摆在他腿上拂来摆去，从一只袋口探出一截酒瓶颈。我心中充满爱与感激之情，那是留在家里的人对徒步的旅人、大地上的流浪者、水手、探险家和游民才会有的感情。爬上山顶后，他转过身来，摘下帽子，向我挥帽致意，长发在他的额前飘扬。

法拉陪我坐在车里，问我：“那位先生去哪里？”法拉称伊曼纽生为先生纯粹出于自重身份，因为毕竟伊曼纽生在我家里过了夜。

“去坦噶尼喀。”我说。

“走去？”他问。

“是的。”我说。

“真主与他同在。”法拉说道。

长长的白日里，我不断想起伊曼纽生，并且走出屋外，向坦噶尼喀的方向张望。到了晚上十点左右，听见一声狮吼，从远远的西南传来，半小时后又是一声。我不禁怀疑它正坐在一件旧黑大衣上。接下来的一星期，我试图打听伊曼纽生的消息，还拜托法拉问他那些开货车去坦噶尼喀的印度熟人，有没有哪辆货车曾经从他身边经过，或者在路上遇到他。但丁点儿消息都没人知道。

半年后，我意外收到一封来自多多马(6)的挂号信，在当地我谁也不认识。信是伊曼纽生写的，里面夹了五十卢比，是起初他想逃离本地时我借给他的，还有法拉的四卢比。除了这份现款外——哪怕全世界的钱从我眼前流过，我都没想过还有机会再见到这笔钱——伊曼纽生给我写了一封通情达理、十分感人的长信。他在多多马找到了一份酒吧侍者的工作——那边能有什么样的酒吧呢——发展得很不错。他似乎有感恩之天性；他记得那晚农场上的每一幕，多次反复回味：在我家，他深觉是置身于挚友之间。他详详细细告诉我他去坦噶尼喀的旅程。他还对马赛人赞不绝口。他们在路上发现了他，并带他回家，让他看到了他们的至诚纯良和殷勤好客。大部分路程都是他们带他一起走的，绕了很多弯路。他写道，他向他们介绍自己的多国历险经历，逗得他们很高兴，甚至不想放他走。马赛语伊曼纽生完全不懂，在他奥德赛般的浪漫旅途中，看来只能退而求其次，用哑剧的表演方式了。

这真是两厢情愿且相得益彰，我心想，伊曼纽生本来就应该向马赛人寻找庇护，而马赛人也当然会接受他。世上真正的贵族和真正的无产阶级双双都理解悲剧。对他们来说，悲剧就是上帝的基本原则，存在的关键——小小的关键。他们因此与其他有产阶级都截然不同。有产阶级拒绝悲剧，不肯承受悲剧的折磨，对他们来说，悲剧这个词就意味着“自身的不幸”。白人中产阶级移民与原住民之间的多少误解，都由此生发。忧郁的马赛人既是贵族又是无产者，他们能一眼识出，这个孤独的黑衣流浪者是一个悲剧形象；而与他们在一起，这位悲剧演员也脱颖而出，找到了自己。

有朋自远近来


朋友到农场来做客，总是我生活中的大喜事，全农场都知道。

一旦丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿的长途远征狩猎接近尾声，就会出现如下画面：清晨，一个马赛少年站在我门口，把重心只压在一条瘦瘦的长腿上。“先生在回家路上，”他宣称，“两三天后就会到。”

下午，一个棚民僮仆从农场近郊赶来，在草地上坐等我出门，只为了告诉我：“有一群珍珠鸡落在河流转弯处。如果你想在先生回家时射几只给他吃的话，我会在日落时候和你一起出去，指给你看能在哪里找到它们。”

对朋友中那些了不起的漫游者来说，我相信我的农场很有诱惑力，因为它持久不变，不管他们何时现身，它都保持着旧日风采。他们游经五湖四海，在天涯海角都搭过帐篷拆过帐篷，现在他们很高兴让车转过大宅的车道拐角，车道如行星轨道般永不改移。他们也很喜欢遇到熟悉的脸孔，我在非洲自始至终都用的是同一批仆人。我在农场百无聊赖，一心渴盼着离开，而返回农场的他们渴盼的是：书籍、亚麻床单、百叶窗下宽敞房中的清冷空气；在安营扎寨处的篝火旁，他们在心中默想农场生活的百般乐趣，一抵达，便急不可耐地问我：“你教过厨师做猎户煎蛋卷吗？——还有，最近的邮件里有《彼得鲁什卡》(1)的唱片吗？”我不在家时，他们也会过来住在这里。我在欧洲逗留期间，丹尼斯便代我做主人。伯克利·科尔称这里为“我的林间隐园”。

作为对物质文明的回报，浪子们从狩猎中带给我战利品：花豹和猎豹的皮，可以在巴黎制成皮大衣；做鞋用的蛇皮和蜥蜴皮；非洲鹳羽毛。

为了让他们高兴，当他们出门在外后，我便从旧烹饪书里找出许多奇奇怪怪的食谱，亲身实验，又努力在我的花园里培育欧洲的花卉。

有一年我回家乡，一位丹麦老夫人给了我十二块上好的牡丹球茎，我颇费周折才把它们带入国境，因为植物进口条例是很严格的。将它们种下后，它们几乎立刻就发芽，爆出曲线玲珑、影影透红的枝梗，随后生出繁枝茂叶和圆圆的蓓蕾。第一朵盛放的牡丹被命名为“内穆尔女大公”(2)，那是一朵饱满的白牡丹，独立枝头，雍容华贵且富丽堂皇，散发着清新甜美的香氛。我把它剪下来，放在起居室里的水瓶里清供，每当白人进入房间，必定驻足停留，对它品评不已。怎么，这是朵牡丹！但之后不久，植株上的其他花苞未经开放便已枯萎，随即纷纷凋零，我没有看到第二朵花。

几年后我与奇罗莫的麦克米兰女士家的英国园丁聊天，说到了牡丹。“我们在非洲引种牡丹从来没成功过，”他说，“也不可能成功，除非我们能设法进口开花的球茎到这里来，就可以采它的种子了。我们就是这样把飞燕草引进殖民地的。”我本可以这种方式把牡丹引入肯尼亚，以此获得内穆尔女大公那样的声名；我却亲手毁了我的千古浮名，只因剪下了那朵唯一的牡丹花，把它浸到水里。此后，我时常在梦中看到那朵白牡丹在枝头成长，满心欢喜，原来我根本没把它剪下来呀。




朋友们从农场出发去内地，又从城里来我家来。土地部的休·马丁常从内罗毕过来逗我开心。他是一位英杰，对世界上稀有的文学作品十分精通。他曾在远东出任公务员，悠闲地过日子，在那里还挖掘了他内在的天赋，因此他看去像一尊胖胖的中国弥勒佛。他叫我老实人(3)，自称是农场怪奇博士邦葛罗斯(4)，他抱有坚定从容的信念，认为人性卑劣可鄙，宇宙亦然。他对此泰然接受——为什么不应该是这样呢？一旦他在大扶手椅上一屁股坐定，几乎就不动窝了。面前有酒有樽，脸庞心平气和、喜气洋洋，把自己的人生理论娓娓道来，推而广之，因这些妙想他浑身散发出光芒，仿佛体重与思想都在飞速增长，奇幻且磷光闪闪。他是心宽体胖的人，与世界和平相处，在撒旦的怀里栖息，在他身上打下了撒旦门徒们清晰的印章——而不是许多耶稣的门徒。

年轻的大鼻子古斯塔夫来自挪威。一晚，他突然从内罗毕另一边自家的农场上，跑到我家来。他是个生机勃勃的农人，在农场事务中，不管口头上还是行动上，都给了我莫大帮助，远超本地其他人。他那本本分分、时刻准备着的态度，仿佛在说：助人是农人的天职；抑或是在说：北欧人随时打算互相效劳。

现在他匆匆来到农场，胸中豪情万状，热烈如火山口喷出来的熔岩。他快疯了，他说，在这个国家，大家觉得男人们每言必谈牛群和剑麻，才是生存之道，他的灵魂饥渴，他再也受不了啦。一走进屋子他就开始了，对爱情、共产主义、卖淫、汉姆生(5)、圣经和他自己的处境高谈阔论，滔滔不绝，直到后半夜，一直抽着非常劣质的卷烟，全不顾吸烟对身体的毒害。他几乎不吃不喝，也不想听别人说什么，如果我试着插句嘴，他会尖叫。内心的火焰照彻了他，他因迷乱而轻飘飘的脑袋用力撞击着空气。他有那么多话想喷薄而出，越说得多，他想表达的就越发蓬勃生长。凌晨两点，突然间，他无话可说了。他往往会静静地坐一会儿，一抹羞涩的表情浮现在脸上，像医院花园里一个处于康复期的病人，他站起身，以惊人的高速开车走人，准备再一次把人生寄托在剑麻和牛群上。

英格丽德·林斯东，当她能从自己的农场上脱身，暂时摆脱火鸡群和商用蔬菜地时，就会从恩乔罗来我这里小住个一两天。英格丽德肤光胜雪，和她的心地一样皎洁。她生在瑞典公务员家庭，又嫁给一个瑞典公务员，夫妇二人和孩子来到非洲，是当作一次野餐，一场愉快的冒险，一条通往美好未来的捷径的。他们买下了一块亚麻田，因为当时亚麻行情是一吨五百镑，然而几乎是顷刻之间，亚麻跌到四十镑，亚麻田和制麻机器变得分文不值，为了家庭和家人，她抖擞出全部勇气来拯救农场，设计养禽场和苗圃，像一个奴隶似的工作。熬过千辛万苦后，她深深地爱上了农场，还有牛群和猪群、原住民和蔬菜以及属于她的这一小片非洲大地，这种如此绝望的激情，令她宁愿售夫卖子也要保住农场。她和我都经历过最坏的年景，一想到要失去我们的土地，就会不由得伏在对方怀里哭泣。英格丽德与我同住的日子，真是开心极了，因为她是传统瑞典农妇，襟怀宽大，敢作敢为，天生就是个乐天派，在她被岁月风吹雨打过的脸庞上，挂着女武神瓦尔基里(6)般的笑容，露出一口坚实的白牙。是否世界偏爱瑞典人？哪怕是遭遇苦难，他们也会将其纳于自己的心胸，光明磊落，因此泽被千里。

有一位基库尤老人，是英格丽德的厨师兼仆人，名叫克莫萨，每天忙忙碌碌为她处理大大小小的杂务，把所有她的事都当作自己的事。他在菜地和养禽场忙活，也为她的三个小女儿扮演陪媪(7)的角色，护送她们往返寄宿学校。当我去恩乔罗她家做客的时候，英格丽德告诉我，克莫萨完全进退失据，手里的活计全丢到一边，就一心一意准备迎接我，要尽可能豪华富丽，还杀了好几只火鸡，全是因为法拉的慷慨大方给他留下了深刻印象。英格丽德说，与法拉相识一场，克莫萨视之为平生最大的荣光。

恩乔罗的达雷尔·汤普森太太，与我几乎不认识，但当医生告知她只有几个月的寿命时，她出门来拜访我。她刚刚从爱尔兰买了一匹矮种马，曾在跳跃障碍赛中获奖——无论生前死后，马匹都是她生命中的荣耀与最高追求——与医生谈过后，她起先打算发电报回家，不让矮种马上路，但随后决定等她去世后，把它留给我。我没把这事放在心上，直到半年后，她过世了，那匹名叫“施舍箱”的矮种马出现在恩贡。施舍箱来到我家后，很快就证明了它是农场上最聪明的生物。它看上去可不怎么样，矮矮壮壮，青春早已一去不复返。丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿喜欢骑它，我可没这想法。凭着善体人意和细心谨慎，凭着对自己意愿的了解及掌控，它在一些年轻俊美、斗志昂扬的马儿中间脱颖而出——那些马可是殖民地上最富有的人豢养的，专门用在这种场合上耀武扬威——在卡波特的赛马跳跃障碍大赛中获大奖。赛事是由威尔士亲王亲自主持的。以它惯有的镇定谦逊的风度与神采，它带回家一块大银牌。整整一星期的紧张焦虑后，仆人和全农场都掀起了一阵胜利与狂喜的热浪，高潮迭起，久久不退。六个月后，它死于马瘟，葬在马厩外的柠檬树下，大家悲痛不已。在逝后，它还英名长存。

老布尔佩特先生，在俱乐部人称查尔斯大叔，经常过来与我一道用餐。他是我的一位好朋友，我的偶像，是位维多利亚时期的英国绅士，在我家里十分自在。他曾经横渡赫勒斯滂，也是马特洪峰的第一批登山者之一。早年间，也许只有十八九岁的他，曾是美人儿奥黛罗(8)的情人。我听说她令他倾家荡产，又一脚把他踢开。对我来说，就好像是在与阿芒·迪尔瓦(9)或者格里奥骑士(10)几位在吃饭。关于奥黛罗，他保存了不少照片，上面的她风华绝代，他也很喜欢说起她。

一天，我们在恩贡吃饭，我问他：“我看到奥黛罗回忆录出版了。你在书里吗？”

“是的，”他答，“我在书里。是用了化名，但确实在里面。”

“她写了你什么呢？”我问。

他说：“她写，我是一个年轻人，为了她，在六个月里，耗尽十万资财，不过也算花得值。”

“那你认为，”我大笑起来，问，“你花得值吗？”

对我的问题，他稍作思索，答：“是的，是的，很值。”

为了庆祝布尔佩特先生的77岁大寿，丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿同我与他一道在恩贡山顶上吃野餐。坐下后，我们开始讨论一个问题：如果给我们一双真的翅膀，永远不能摘下，将接受还是拒绝？

老布尔佩特先生坐着，远远凝望着我们脚下广阔无垠的疆土，青翠的恩贡山脉和西方的东非大裂谷，仿佛已经做好准备随时振翅飞翔。“我会接受，”他说，“我当然会接受。再没有什么是我更喜欢的。”沉吟片刻，他加了一句：“不过，如果我是位女士，我估计我可能会再考虑一下。”

拓荒者中的贵族


对伯克利·科尔和丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿而言，我的家是共产主义天堂，里面的一针一线都是他们的，他们很引以为荣，一感觉有物资短缺，他们就置办了带回来。他们保持着这个家高标准的烟酒质量，还从欧洲为我带来书和唱片。伯克利每次过来，车厢里都装满了他肯尼亚山农场出品的火鸡蛋和橙子。他们都有雄心壮志，想培养出我对酒的品鉴力，在这项任务上，他们耗费大量时间，多方思忖。他们对我的丹麦式酒杯及瓷器青睐有加，经常在餐桌上，用我所有的酒杯垒出一个光彩熠熠的金字塔，一件摞在另一件上面，这景象令他们欢喜不已。

伯克利在农场上时，每天上午十一点，都会带着一瓶香槟酒到森林里去喝。一次，他正准备告辞上路，为他的农场小住向我致谢时，又加了一句说：白璧亦有微瑕，在树下饮酒时，用的是粗糙俗气的非洲酒杯。“我知道，伯克利，”我说，“但我剩的好酒杯不多了，而且仆人们要把酒杯长途搬运那么远，会打碎的。”他严肃地看着我，握住我的手。“但我亲爱的，”他说，“劣质酒杯太让人心情低落了。”那之后，他就带上我最好的酒杯到树林里去。

关于伯克利和丹尼斯，有一件很奇妙的事——他们移居海外时，他们在英国本土的朋友都深以为憾。在殖民地，他们也十分受人爱慕敬重——但同时，他们仍然自始至终都是被放逐者。不是社会也不是全世界任何一个地方驱逐了他们，是时间，他们不属于自己的时代。除了英国，再没有任何民族能培养出他们，而他们是返祖现象的样板，属于一个过去的英国，一个已经灰飞烟灭的世界。当下的新纪元，没有他们的家园，他们不得不四海为家，也经常到农场来。关于这个，他们自己倒是毫无察觉；相反，对被扔在他们身后的英国生活，他们倒是满心疚意，仿佛他们只因为烦了，就逃离了岗位，而朋友们仍在坚持自己的岗位。丹尼斯说起年轻的日子——虽然他还是很年轻——以及未来，还有他在英国的朋友们寄给他的建议时，往往会引用莎士比亚《皆大欢喜》中杰奎斯的话：

倘有痴愚之徒，

忽然变成蠢驴，

趁着心性癫狂，

撇却财富安康……



但是他的自我认识是错的，正如伯克利，可能杰奎斯也错了。他们相信自己是逃兵，有时必得为这任性付出代价，但事实上他们是被放逐者，心甘情愿接受这放逐。

如果在伯克利的小脑袋上戴上一顶长长柔滑卷发的假发套，他便可以在国王查理二世(1)的宫廷里出入。作为一位来自英国的敏慧青年，他可能会坐在上了年纪的达达尼昂(2)脚边，那是《二十年后》(3)时代的达达尼昂。他听取老人的智慧箴言，把每一句话都铭记在心。我觉得物理定律对伯克利不适用，我们坐在炉火边彻夜聊天时，他似乎可以随时从烟囱里飞身而去。他是个明辨是非的人，对大众既不抱幻想也没有恶意。基于一种奇异的魔力，即使那些他持最不堪态度的人，也会深深被他吸引。当他鞋底抹油，从事务上溜之大吉时，放松的他是个无与伦比的搞笑人物。要在20世纪成为康格里夫(4)和威彻利(5)式的智者，需要比康格里夫和威彻利本身更多的人格特质：热情洋溢、气势宏伟和不灭的希望。笑话因其放胆和厚颜，传得很远，有时却令人下泪。伯克利喝了酒后有点发热，几乎通体透明，真正进入傲岸不屈的状态，他投在身后墙上的影子迅速扩大且动荡不安。此时他是一个傲慢而满心狂热的流浪汉，仿佛这要归源于他的贵族血统，而他父亲的名字叫罗西南特(6)。伯克利本人，不败的笑话大王，在他的非洲生活里孑然一身，因心脏病经常发作，事实是半废之人，他最爱的肯尼亚山农场正逐日落在银行手中，他却对人生的阴影视而不见，无所畏惧。

体格纤小，非常瘦弱，红发，手脚都很细小，伯克利永远身架笔挺，头达达尼昂式地左右微微摆动，有战无不胜决斗者般的风范。他走起路来，猫儿一般无声无息。另外，就像猫儿一样，他无论身处何地，都会把那一处弄得舒舒服服，有如一个家，仿佛他体内就有热源和快乐之灶。每当伯克利来了，与你一起吞云吐雾，任由烟气毁了你的房子，他正如一只小猫，让你感到自己舒适地蜷依于一个精心选择出来的角落里。当他身心轻快，你会听到他发出大猫般满意的呜噜声；而当他被疾病所袭，无限忧伤，十分沮丧，你一定会胆战心惊，就像你的爱猫得病一样。他百无禁忌，却有顽固得令人吃惊的成见，正如你在一只猫身上可以预想的那样。

如果伯克利是斯图亚特王朝(7)的骑士，丹尼斯就应该处身于更久远的英国图卷，伊丽莎白女王一世(8)的年代。在那里，他能与菲利浦爵士(9)或者法兰西斯·德瑞克(10)把臂同游。伊丽莎白时期的人们会与他一见如故，因为他令他们想起古希腊雅典之风，那是他们朝思暮想、日夜吟咏的所在。在我们文明史上的每一时期直到19世纪初，丹尼斯都会真的与时代融为一体，处处为家。任何年代他都能崭露头角，因为他是运动健将、音乐家、艺术爱好者和出色的冒险家。而在他自己的时代，他也鹤立鸡群，可并非在每一处都相宜。他在英国的朋友们都希望他回家，为他的英国生活拟订方案而殚精竭虑，但非洲留住了他。

伯克利和丹尼斯，以及其他一些与他们类同的人，都对所有非洲原住民有独特的、本能的吸引力，这让我意识到：也许前朝的白人们，无论是哪一个前朝，与有色人种之间的理解与同情，都胜过工业时代的我们，而且理当如此。当第一部蒸汽机设计出来，世界各种族自此分道扬镳，永远不再相见。

我与伯克利之间的友谊因为一件事而蒙上了一层阴影：他年轻的索马里仆人贾玛所在的部落与法拉的部落争战不休。凡熟悉索马里人排他情绪的人都知道，当他们各自侍立于伯克利和我之后，黝黑深沉、不毛之地般的眼神如何在我们餐桌上空交汇，显示着心中要多毒辣有多毒辣的恨意。夜深人静时分，我俩不由得谈起，如果明早出门，发现法拉和贾玛，双双尸身冰冷，胸口插着匕首，该怎么办。在部落问题上，敌对的双方毫不畏惧，也绝无理性。让他们能隐忍不发控制流血杀戮和毁灭冲动的，一直以来，唯有对伯克利和我的依恋。

“我可不敢告诉贾玛，”伯克利说，“说我改变主意，今晚不去埃尔多雷特(11)了，那里住着他正在爱恋的年轻姑娘。一旦说了，他就会对我心如铁石，我的事务，比如衣服有没有刷过呀，变得无足轻重，他会出门去杀掉法拉的。”

不过贾玛还从不曾对伯克利硬过心肠。他跟随伯克利已经多年，两人经常谈话。伯克利告诉我，有一次，在一件事上贾玛坚持自己是正确的，伯克利大发雷霆，动手打了这个索马里人。“不过马上，我亲爱的，你知道，”伯克利说，“就在这千钧一发之际，我脸上被他回敬了一拳。”

“后来如何？”我问。

“哦，没事。”伯克利淡淡答道。过了一会儿，他加了一句：“也不坏。他比我年轻二十岁呢。”

这小插曲没在主仆情谊上留下任何痕迹，贾玛对伯克利有一种平静的、略微屈尊俯就的态度，绝大部分索马里仆人对雇主皆如是。伯克利去世后，贾玛不想再留在这里，便回了索马里兰。

对于大海，伯克利有永不餍足的炽热深爱。我与他都有一个特别心仪的梦想——一旦我们有钱——就买一艘帆船，扬帆远行去拉姆、蒙巴萨和桑给巴尔。我们拟定了整套计划，备好了船员名单，就是从来没弄到过钱。

每当伯克利累了或者身体不适，他就会沉浸在自己的大海梦里。他会辗转难安于自己的愚蠢，在各种地方耗尽一生的寿命而不是在海上，每次提起，恨声不绝。一次我要启程去欧洲，他又在这种状态下，为了让他高兴，我准备带回两只船用灯笼，左右舷各一个，挂在我房子大门口上。我把这事告诉了他。

“行，好极了，”他说，“从路上看去，房子会像一艘船。不过一定要出过海航过行的灯笼。”

于是在哥本哈根一条古运河边的渔夫商店，我买下一对沉重的老旧船用灯笼，它们曾在波罗的海上航行了许多年。我们将灯笼挂在门口，一边一个，面朝正东。我们很高兴，觉得挂得正在其位，因为当地球沿着自己的轨道向前运行时，路经此地就不会撞上了。灯笼让伯克利由衷满足。他经常在夜深后才到我家来，一路高速，但当灯光映入他眼帘，他会慢下来，慢下来，缓缓驶过车道。夜空里灯光如一红一绿的星光(12)，他任那星光沉入自己的灵魂，给他带回乘船远游的旧时记忆画面，让他觉得，仿佛他真的在靠近沧海无垠间一艘停泊的船。借助灯笼，我们发展了一套信号系统，变换舷灯的位置或者取下一盏来，就能让正在森林间的他知道，他的女东道主是什么心情，怎样的晚餐在等着他。




伯克利，像他的兄弟加尔本雷斯·科尔，以及他的姐夫德拉米尔勋爵一样，都是早期移民，殖民地的垦荒者，与马赛人相交甚深。那时，马赛人还是这片大地上横行霸道的民族。他认识他们已久，在欧洲文明切断他们的根基之前，在他们从美丽的北部乡村移居这里之前。而在马赛人心深处，欧洲文明是他们最切齿痛恨的事物，胜于这世上的一切。他能用马赛语同他们一起缅怀往日的时光。无论何时伯克利来到农场，马赛人都会跨河来见他。老酋长们坐着，与他聊自己当下遇到的麻烦事，他的玩笑总令他们笑声不绝，仿佛坚硬的石头在哈哈大笑。

伯克利对马赛人这样熟稔，又与之友情深笃，于是一项极其堂皇的仪式在农场上举行。

一战刚刚爆发的时候，马赛人听说消息，这个古老好战民族的血立刻沸腾了。他们幻想着辉煌的战役、惨烈的大屠杀，希望看到过往的荣誉再次出现。开战的第一个月，我受命出门，孤身在原住民和索马里人的陪同下，带着三辆牛车，为英国政府做运输工作，在马赛人居留区艰苦跋涉。每到一处，无论是几点钟，只要人们听说我来了，都会集在我的帐篷外，双眼放光，问我上百个问题：关于战争和德国人——他们真是从空中来的吗？在他们的脑海中，那些人正跑得上气不接下气，迎向危险和死亡。晚上，年轻武士们蜂拥在我帐篷外，全身涂满战争文身，手持剑与盾。有时，为了让我了解他们的真实形象，他们会仿效狮吼，发出短促的啸声。他们当然会被允许参战，对此他们毫不怀疑。

但英国政府认为，组织马赛人同白人，尤其是同德国人作战，不甚明智，于是禁止马赛人参战，终结了他们的希望。基库尤人作为运输人员参战，马赛人却必须把他们的武器束之高阁。但在1918年，征兵范围已开放到殖民地上所有其他原住民，政府认为也有必要召集马赛人。英国皇家军队的一位军官，带着军团，被派往纳罗克(13)征召三百名马赛武士当兵。但当时马赛人已不再觉得他们与战争休戚相关，拒绝应征。当地的马赛武士纷纷销声匿迹，躲进了树林和灌木丛。在追捕中，英国皇家军队的战士误对村寨开火，两位老妪死于非命。两天后，马赛人居留区全面爆发叛乱，马赛武士成群结队横扫城乡，杀了许多印度商人，焚烧了五十多间店铺。局势严峻，政府不想以铁腕镇压。德拉米尔勋爵被派遣与马赛人谈判，最后达成了协议。允许马赛人自行派出三百战士参战，他们对居留区的破坏以罚款处理，其他事既往不咎。事实上，马赛战士无一出现。停战协议签署后，这事也就不了了之。

而在这前前后后，一些上了年纪的马赛人大酋长曾为英国军队略尽绵薄之力，派出他们的年轻子民跟踪居留区和边界上德国人的行动。现在战争结束了，政府想彰显自己对他们服务的高度赞赏。一些奖章从母国运来，要在马赛人中颁发，其中有十二枚奖章到了伯克利手中，因为他与马赛人熟识，又能说马赛语，便请他来颁奖。

我的农场与马赛人居留区接壤，伯克利来问我，能否借我家颁奖。对此重任他也有些紧张，告诉我，他还不清楚大家希望他如何表现。在一个星期日，我们一起驱车赶了很远的路，去居留区同村寨上的人谈话，与酋长们讨论这一天的基本步骤。年轻时，伯克利曾在第九枪骑兵团服役，我听说在当时他的兵团里，他是最机敏的年轻军官。太阳下山时，我们开车回家，他向我说起军人天职和军人精神，身为普通公民，他仍然要以自己的方式将其发扬发大。

颁发奖章这一行为，本身并无意义，却仍然仪式盛大，举足轻重。而当事双方，都需要睿智、深谋远虑、圆滑老练，才能使它跻身于世界历史，成为一桩历史事件，或者一种象征：

……他的黑暗与光明

彬彬有礼地互致敬意。



马赛老人们抵达了，他们的儿子或家臣紧随其后。他们在草地上坐等，不时谈论那些在草地上吃草的牛群，也许他们抱着模糊的希望，为了褒奖他们的鞍马之劳，说不定会赠送一头奶牛给他们。伯克利让他们等了很久，我深信，他们觉得这等待是理所当然的。另外，他让人往房子正前方的草地上搬了一把扶手椅，他将坐在上面颁发奖章。他终于从房子里出来了，在黑肤众人的映衬下，看上去英俊潇洒，红发明眸，完完全全是一个身手敏捷、朝气蓬勃的年轻军官，一举一动都显得高效精干。于是我明白了：那就是伯克利，他的脸会说话，能表达很多事物，在需要的时候甚至能展示出绝对的空白。为他引路的是贾玛，身穿华贵的阿拉伯礼服背心，满绣金银，这礼服是伯克利让他买来专门出席此类场面的；现在他双手捧着奖章盒。

伯克利站在椅前开始发言，纤小身形昂然而立。受他的活力感染，老人们一个接着一个，陆续起身。在他面前，他们站得笔直，眼光郑重地看向他。演讲到底说了什么，我不知道，因为用的是马赛语。听起来，似乎他是在简短地向马赛人声明：一份意外的赏赐将赋予他们，而这是缘于他们本身令人惊叹、功不可没的英勇行为。但是，考虑到慷慨陈词的是伯克利，而从马赛人的脸上什么也读不出来，也许讲话内容其实风马牛不相及呢，关于这个，我倒没想到过。发言一结束，他立刻让贾玛捧过盒子来，取出奖章，挨个儿庄重地读出马赛酋长们的名字，手臂伸得长长的，把奖章递给他们。马赛人非常平静地从他手里接过奖章，姿势也同样是伸长手臂。我认为：仪式能进行得这般尽善尽美，全因双方都有贵族血统和悠久的家族历史——倘若民主派不责怪我的观点。

把奖章颁给一个全身赤裸的人是很不方便的，因为这人没地方戴它。马赛老酋长们只好继续站着，手里拿着奖章。过了一会儿，一位耄耋老者走向我，伸出握着奖章的手，请我告诉他：上面有什么。我尽我所能解释给他听。银牌一面是大不列颠女神头像(14)，另一面上镌有“世界文明之战”字样。

随后，我告诉一些英国朋友关于奖章的小段子，他们问我：“为什么奖章上不是国王头像？真是大错特错。”我倒不这么觉得，我认为奖章本来就不应该制造得太令人瞩目，这样安排是最恰当的。“天上的赏赐是大的”(15)，当它被赐予我们，可能也就是这一类事物吧。




伯克利病倒的时候，我正准备到欧洲度假。他当时是殖民地立法委员会成员之一，我打电报给他：“你不打算来恩贡待几天，参加我们的例会吗？带上酒。”他回电道：“你的电报有如天国来鸿。将携酒抵达。”当他到农场的时候，车里装满了酒，他却没有喝的意思。他脸色非常苍白，有时甚至相当沉默。他的心脏很衰弱，没有贾玛，他几乎寸步难行，为此，贾玛学会了给他打针。很多忧虑沉重地向他袭来，他时刻担心会失去农场。但仍和从前一样，因为他的在场，我的家立刻变成这世上最得天独厚、春风融融的角落。

“我已经到了这一阶段，塔尼亚(16)，”他沉痛地对我说，“现在我只能驾驶最精良的车，能抽最昂贵的烟，能喝最美味的陈年佳酿。”在我家住了一段之后，一晚他告诉我，医生要求他立刻卧床，静养一个月。我说，如果他肯遵从医嘱，在恩贡卧床一个月，我会放弃旅行留在此地照顾他，明年再去欧洲。他思索了一会儿我的提议。“我亲爱的，”他说，“我不能接受。如果为了取悦你而这么做，那么，以后倘若我想讨你欢心，还有什么可做的呢？”

怀着沉重的心情，我与他道别。回家路上，要经过拉穆古镇和泰考格，帆船即将靠岸，我想起了伯克利。在巴黎时，我听说，他死了。就在他家门口，打算迈步下车时，他倒了下来，自此回天乏术。依照他的遗愿，遗体安葬在他自己的农场上。

伯克利去了，这个国家也变了。怀着无限悲痛的朋友们当时就感觉到了，还有很多人将陆续意识到。殖民地历史的新纪元与他一道画上了句号。随着岁月的推移，许多事都从这一转捩点开始计算，人们会说“当伯克利·科尔还活着的时候”或者“自从伯克利去世”。在他生前，这个国家一直是激动人心的狩猎营地，现在它慢慢地演变，转为商业主题区。他过世后，一些标准随之降低：智慧水准的低落，立刻被发现——在殖民地，这真令人沮丧；绅士风度的水准亦然——他去世后不久，大家就开始谈及自家的麻烦；人道的水准亦不曾逃脱此劫。

随着伯克利远走，一个恐怖的阴影从舞台的另一翼悄然登场——“必然性”是如此铁面无私，人或神都无能躲闪。那样一个身材矮小的人，竟然能把它拒之门外，只要他还有一口气，就顽抗到底，真让人咄咄称奇。失去他，这片大地就像是失去酵母的面包。一个优雅、快乐和自由的化身，一个功率强大的电动机舍我们而去。一只猫静静起身，离开了房间。

翼


丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿在非洲除了我的农场之外，没有别的住址。每次远征狩猎期间，他总住在我家，他的书和唱片都存在这里。每次当他回到农场，农场都会尽呈所有；农场在发言——正如咖啡园在倾诉，雨季的第一场喜雨过后，花朵盛放，湿淋淋的，似水粉绘出的云朵。我在等待丹尼斯回家，听见他的车开上车道的声音，与此同时，我听见农场的万事万物都在轻声诉说他们的真实存在。他只在想来的时候才来，所以在农场上总是很开心；而农场知道，在他身上，有一种全世界都不曾留意到的品质，一种谦逊。他从不做违心的事，也向来不巧言令色。

丹尼斯有一种特殊的性格，对我弥足珍贵，那就是他喜欢听人讲故事。因为我时常想到，我也可以在佛罗伦萨大瘟疫时期(1)大显身手。流行千变万化，听故事的艺术已在欧洲失传，不认字的非洲原住民却依然保有这传统。如果你对他们这样开头：“一个男人出门去，在荒原上遇到了另一个男人。”他们立刻对你全神贯注，所有的注意力都集中在荒原男人未知的行踪上。但白种人，即使自觉应该这样做，也很难做到聆听其他人的朗读。如果他们没有焦躁不安，或者想起必须马上做的事，那一定是因为睡着了。要么他们会跟你要几本书来读读，然后长坐终夜，手里捧着随便一本什么书，完全沉浸在其中——甚至可以是一篇演说词。他们已经习惯用眼睛来获得印象。

丹尼斯主要是靠耳朵生存，宁愿听故事而不是读；每当来到农场上，他都会问：“你有故事要讲吗？”趁他不在家，我已经构思了千千万万个故事。到了晚上，他在炉火前拉开一张垫子当作沙发，坐进去，把自己弄得舒舒服服的。而我席地而坐，双腿交叉恍如山鲁佐德(2)本人。他会凝神静听，双目炯炯地听完一个长长的故事，从头到尾，一字不落。他比我自己记得更清楚，当一个角色戏剧化地现身，他会突然制止我，开口道：“这个人故事最开始时就死了。不过无所谓了。”

丹尼斯教我拉丁语，为了让我能读《圣经》和希腊诗篇。他本人对《旧约全书》的大部分内容都烂熟于心，在每段旅行中都随身带着《圣经》，这为他赢得了穆斯林们的极高赞誉。

我的留声机是他给的。它给农场带来了新生命，令我满心喜悦，它变成了农场之声——正如“夜莺是林间空地的灵魂”。有时丹尼斯会蓦然到访，带着新唱片，而我正在咖啡园里或者玉米地里忙活；他会让留声机开着，当我在落日时分骑马归来，美妙的旋律轰鸣而至，在夜晚的清冽空气里，向我宣布他的存在，仿佛他正在向我咧嘴而笑，就像他一贯的样子。原住民喜欢留声机，经常围站在屋外听音乐；一些仆人，当只有我与他们在房里时，会找出最心仪的乐曲，央我放给他们听。让我想不通的是，卡曼特也有自己的偏爱，他狂热地迷恋贝多芬C大调钢琴协奏曲的柔板；第一次他让我放音乐的时候，费了好大劲儿描绘，才让我弄明白他想要哪一首曲子。

不过丹尼斯与我品位并不一致。我青睐古典音乐家，而丹尼斯，因为他与时下格格不入，仿佛怀着想要弥补的好意，在所有艺术形式中，都是越现代越好。“我应该会喜欢贝多芬，”他说，“如果他不是那么世人皆知。”

只要丹尼斯与我在一起，不管何时都有缘与狮子交会。有时他结束了两三个月的狩猎远征回家，很是恼火，因为他带了欧洲朋友一起去，却不能为后者捕一头好狮子。那段日子，马赛人也到我府上来，说有一只雄狮或雌狮正在为害他们的牛群，请我过去射杀。法拉与我上了路，在他们的村寨里安插帐篷，彻夜守着一头被咬死的牲畜，或者清早时在四周搜索，始终不见狮子的踪迹。但当丹尼斯与我并肩骑马奔驰在原野上，会看到狮群在附近隐隐约约出没，仿佛在追随我们。我们曾正面遇见正在用餐的它们，也曾目睹它们穿过干涸的河床。




一个元旦的早晨，日出之前，丹尼斯与我在新修的纳罗克公路上开车疾驶着，在这条起伏不平的路上，我们已经开得尽可能快了。

就在前一天，丹尼斯把一支重型步枪借给一位要去南部参加狩猎队伍的朋友，到夜深时，他突然想起，这支步枪有一个机关，一旦触发，微力扳机可能会失灵，而他一时疏忽，忘了告诉朋友。他急坏了，生怕这位猎手会因他的愚蠢遭遇不测。我们当下决定：最好的补救措施，就是尽可能早地出发，沿新路争分夺秒，力争在纳罗克拦截住狩猎团。路程有一百千米远，途经一些崎岖颠簸的地区；远征一般都是沿老路，队伍里有好几辆负载沉重的货车，所以走得很慢。唯一的麻烦是，新公路是否已经全线贯通，到底能不能直达纳罗克，我们还不知道。

非洲高原的黎明，空气凛冽清泠到几乎有冷凝感，触手可握，曾经的幻象又一次次浮现，令人恍惚：你根本不是脚踏实地，而是在黝黑的深水间，在海底穿行。你甚至根本无法确定你是否在行动，寒潮扑面而来，也许是深海的洋流，而你的车像一条缓缓的电鱼，很可能正安静地盘踞在海底，身前大发光明，是车灯闪耀如明眸，任无数的深海生物从它身边流淌而过。星辰如此硕大，乃是因为它们并非真实的星星，只是在水面上微微闪烁的倒影。海底路径的两边，比周遭环境更黑沉的活物们忽隐忽现，有时跳将起来，有时在高高的草丛中隐身不见，像螃蟹和沙蚤一路向前，最后没入沙中。天光渐次明亮，日出时分，海底突然腾空跃出水面，刹那间成为新生的岛屿。各种气味汇成旋涡，在你身边飞速滑过：橄榄树丛的新鲜气味，嗅味分明；被烧焦的枯草有盐湖气息；一阵朽败的气息陡地袭来，令人窒息。

丹尼斯的仆人卡努侠坐在车厢后部，此刻轻轻碰碰我的肩头，向右方指了指。在路边大概十几米远的地方，有一个黑色的庞然大物，像一只海牛在沙滩上小憩，深水里，什么东西在它头顶盘旋不去。随后我看出来，那是一头雄长颈鹿的尸体，大概是两三天前被射杀的。长颈鹿是禁止捕猎的，丹尼斯和我后来不得不为自己辩护，否认是我们杀了它的指控：我们能证明我们到的时候，它已经死了好一段时间，不过一直无法得知，是谁，又是为什么杀了它。就在长颈鹿的巨大残骸旁，一只雌狮正伏在它身上大嚼，此刻抬起上身，看向经过的车。

丹尼斯停住车，卡努侠把一直背在肩头的枪举起来。丹尼斯低声问我：“我能打它吗？”——他一向谦抑有礼，视恩贡山脉为我的私人狩猎场。我们刚刚穿过的田地，正是马赛人到我家来哭诉畜群损失的那一片；如果眼前这只就是吃掉他们一头又一头奶牛和牛犊的祸害，此刻就是它的末日。我点点头。

他从车里跳出去，向后腾挪数步，此时，雌狮窜到长颈鹿身后。他沿着长颈鹿绕圈，枪口始终不离雌狮，开了火。我没有看见它栽下；当我下车走过去，它已经死了，倒在大摊浓稠的血泊里。

没有时间剥狮皮了，如果打算在纳罗克截住狩猎队伍，必须立刻开车上路。我们环顾左右，记住地点，长颈鹿腐尸的气味如此强烈，我们是不可能在不知不觉间错过这里的。

然而，再向前开了三千米之后，道路断了。筑路工具散落在那里；道路尽头外是开阔的乱石地面，在晨光里一片灰蒙，全不曾被人力开采过。我们看看工具，又看看旷野，只能听天由命，任丹尼斯的朋友用那把枪冒险了——事后，他打猎归来，告诉我们：他根本没机会用到那支枪。于是我们掉头回家，归途正面向东方的天幕，初升的太阳红遍了田野和山川。我们迎着太阳而去，一路都在谈论那只雌狮。

长颈鹿已近在眼前，这一次我们能看得清清楚楚。阳光照在它一侧的皮毛上，能辨出那里稍暗的方形斑块。靠近了，我们看见有一只雄狮站在那里。我们正在行经的途中，比长颈鹿躺的地方低一点儿；正站在长颈鹿尸体上的狮子，雄姿英发的黑色剪影，它身后，是朝霞燃烧的天空。好一只纹章狮(3)，风拂起它的鬃毛。我从车里站起身，不由得被雄狮强烈震撼。目睹此情，丹尼斯说：“这次你来。”我对他的枪一直没什么想法，它对我来说太长太重，后坐力很强；但这一枪是爱的宣言，难道还不应该是最大的超强火力吗？一枪射出，雄狮似乎笔直向天空跃去，随即四脚着地，轰然倒下。我在草丛间伫立着，喘息着，开枪所给人的生杀予夺感使我面红心跳，隔着距离，亦能取其性命。我走到长颈鹿身边。眼前的场景——是古典悲剧的第五幕(4)：出场人物现在死光了。长颈鹿体形惊人地庞大，极其惨烈，四条僵直的腿和一条僵直的长脖子，被两只狮子开膛破肚了。雌狮仰面朝天，脸上凝着一个傲慢的咆哮表情，她是这出戏中的蛇蝎美人。雄狮躺在她不远处，为什么她的不幸不曾给他任何启示？他的头搁在两只前爪上，粗大的鬃毛覆盖它周身，有如皇家斗篷，它在血泊中安睡着，在清晨的明亮光线里，一片殷红。

太阳升起来了，丹尼斯和卡努侠卷高袖管，开始剥狮皮。当他们小作休息的时候，我们共饮了一瓶波尔多红酒，还从车里拿来葡萄干和杏仁吃了；我随身带着它们，准备在路上吃，因为今天是新年第一天。我们坐在低低的草丛中，大吃大喝。死去的两只狮子，近在咫尺，剥光了皮也一样华丽庄严，周身上下没有一寸赘肉，每一块肌肉都是收发得宜的结实曲线。它们不需要皮囊蔽体，不管怎么样，它们都保持着自己的本来面目。

我们正坐着，突然一道黑影掠过草地，从我脚面上一闪而过，抬头上望，我能认出，在一碧如洗的晴空高处，秃鹫正在盘旋。我的心如此轻盈，仿佛我也在飞翔，与秃鹫一道，在长绳的一端，一如风筝。我写下了一首诗：

鹰的影子越过田野，

飘向远方那无名的青山。

而圆胖的小斑马，

影子终日藏在纤细的四蹄中间。

它们凝然不动，

等待着夜晚，等待着探足而去，

当草原被落日染成砖红，

它是碧蓝的剪影，

在泉边徜徉。



丹尼斯和我还跟狮群有一次戏剧化的遭遇。事实上，它比刚刚那一次发生得要早，在我们友谊的最初日子。

正是春雨时节，一天早晨，我当时的南非经理尼克尔斯先生火烧屁股般地跑到大宅，告诉我：有两只狮子晚上到农场上来了，弄死了两只公牛。它们破坏了牛栏的篱笆，把公牛尸体拖到咖啡园，在那里吃掉了一只，另一只还撂在咖啡树下。我能马上给他写一封介绍信，让他去内罗毕弄一些马钱子碱吗？他会放在牛尸上，因为他觉得狮子们今晚准定还会来。

我反复想了又想，觉得对狮子投放马钱子碱有违我心意。我告诉他，我不能这么做。听到这话，他由激动霎时变得暴跳如雷。他说，如果犯下这等罪孽还任它们逍遥法外，狮子们下次一定还会故地重游。它们杀害的两只公牛乃是干活最卖力的耕牛，我们可再损失不起了。他提醒我：我的马厩离牛场不远，我想到过没？我解释说：我并不是任狮子们在农场上为所欲为，只是我觉得应该射杀而不是毒杀。

“那么谁来开枪？”尼克尔斯说道，“我不是胆小鬼，但我有老婆，我可不打算拿生命冒无谓之险。”千真万确，他并非懦夫，个子虽小，却勇气十足。他说：“这么做毫无意义。”不，我说，我不是授意他去射杀狮子。只是芬奇-哈顿先生昨晚到了农场，现在正在大宅，他和我会处理。“哦，那就好。”尼克尔斯说。

我随即找到丹尼斯。“现在来吧，”我对他说，“让我们拿生命冒无谓之险。生命若有任何价值，是因为它一无所有。向死而生者，才有真正自由的生活。”

我们出门去，在咖啡园发现了死去的小公牛，正如尼克尔斯告诉我的那样，它几乎没怎么被狮子们碰过。雨后松软的泥地上留下了深深的脚印，清晰可辨，夜里来的想必是两头大狮子。我们沿着狮子脚印穿过种植场，上到贝尔纳普房子外的树林里。但当我们走到那里时，雨下得很大，视物困难，在草丛上、灌木丛里以及树林的边缘里，都看不到狮子的足迹。

“你怎么想，丹尼斯？”我问他，“它们今晚还会来吗？”

丹尼斯对于狮子经验丰富。他说它们晚上会早早地来，为了吃完大餐。应该先给它们时间安顿下来，因此九点钟左右，我们过来。要带上他狩猎装备中的手电筒，为射击照明。这二人搭档，他让我做主挑选角色，但我宁愿让他开枪，我为他拿手电筒就好了。

为了能在黑暗中找到通往死牛的路，我们剪下纸带，系在打算经过的咖啡树上标示路径，一如汉塞尔和格蕾塔(5)用小白石子做的事。这将指引我们径直前往牛只伏尸处，而在路的尽头，离牛身二十米处，我们在树上系了一张较大的纸，将在此地停步，打开手电，举枪射击。下午将暮时分，我们拿出电筒试用，发现电池已经没电了，灯光非常微弱。现在没时间去内罗毕买电池，只能将就用它，尽力而为。

那天是丹尼斯生日的前一天，我们吃晚饭的时候，他正陷在多愁善感的情绪里，郁郁寡欢于直到现在他对人生还不满的欲求。我安慰他道：在他生日前夕，可能我们要做一件大事哦。我吩咐朱玛拿一瓶酒出来，准备迎接我们的凯旋。我一直在想这两头狮子：此时此刻，它们身处哪里？是否正在涉河而过，步履从容，静静的，一头在前，一头在后，清冷的河水缓缓流过它们的胸膛和肋腹。

九点，我们出发了。

微微下着雨，但月亮还是出来了，朦胧皎洁的脸庞高挂在天空，在薄薄的云层间时隐时现，月下繁花似雪的咖啡园光影迷离。我们远远地经过学校，它正灯火通明。

目睹此景，一种身为人类的骄傲和胜利感一如狂潮，席卷全身。我想起所罗门王，他曾说过：“懒惰人说：道上有猛狮，街上有壮狮。”(6)在他们门外就有两头狮子，但我的学童们既不懒惰，也没有因狮子而吓得不去上学。

我们找到了做过标记的两行咖啡树，稍作休息后，便一前一后顺着它们向前走。我俩都穿着软帮鞋，走起路来悄无声息。因为紧张兴奋，我下意识颤抖哆嗦起来。我不敢靠丹尼斯太近，害怕他会发现，打发我回去；同样，我也不敢离他太远，因为他随时都可能需要我的电筒光。

我们发现，狮子们已经在尸身旁了。它们听到了我们的动静，抑或嗅到了我们的气味，走开了一点儿，闪进咖啡田里，任我们过去。很可能嫌我们走得太慢，其中一只在我们右前方，发出一阵低低嘶哑的咆哮。声音太低，几不可闻，我们甚至无法确定是不是真听见了。丹尼斯止住步子，没有转过脸看我，只是问：“你听到了吗？”“是的。”我说。

我们又向前走了一小段，低沉的狮吼声再次传来，这一次就在正右方向。“开灯。”丹尼斯说。这不是一件容易的事，因为他比我高得多，我必须把手电高高举起，让灯光越过他的肩膀，落在枪口上，投向远方。电筒一开，整个世界霎时变成灯火辉煌的舞会，咖啡树湿湿的叶子熠熠生光，地面上的土块都历历可见。

起初，光圈照到的，是一只眼睛睁得大大的小豺，像一只小狐狸；我移动着方向，狮子在光圈里出现了。它径直与我们面对面，整个黑暗的非洲之夜都在它身后，将它衬托得无比光明。枪声响起。近在耳边，我全无心理准备，一时间甚至没反应过来这意味着什么，仿佛不过是一声惊雷，仿佛中枪的是我，不是狮子。狮子像块石头一样应声栽倒。“继续，继续。”丹尼斯对我喊。我把电筒方向转向更远处，但我的手抖得这么厉害，光圈满世界乱跑，我竭力控制，它还是到处狂舞个不停。我听见身边的黑暗处，丹尼斯大笑起来——“电筒照第二只狮子的时候，”他事后对我说，“有点儿抖。”——而在光圈的最中央，第二头狮子现身了，它离我们远远的，半个身子藏在咖啡树后。灯光打在它身上时，它转了一下头。丹尼斯开了枪。它跌出光圈，随即起身，身形又进入光圈，面朝着我们左扑右摆，就在此时，第二枪响起，它发出一声长长的、愤怒的哀鸣。

转瞬之间，非洲变得无边无际地庞大，丹尼斯与我，置身于此，渺小得不可思议。电筒光之外，一无所有，除了黑暗还是黑暗。黑暗中，雨夜的天空下，左右两侧各倒着一只狮子。它们深邃的嘶吼永远沉寂，整个世界都已瘫痪，狮子们静静地躺着，头偏向一边，是一种抱恨终生的姿态。咖啡园里，有两只死去的庞然大物，四周万籁俱寂。

我们走向狮子，用脚步丈量距离。我们所站的地方，离第一头狮子有三十米远，第二头是二十五米。它们都年轻气盛，膘肥体壮，是一对亲密的朋友，在山间与田野上形影不离，昨天突然心血来潮大冒险，为此，双双殒命。

现在，所有的学童都从学校里奔了出来，路上万头涌动，看到我们时才停下来，用一种奶声奶气的声音低声喊道：“姆萨布。是你们在那儿吗？你们在吗？姆萨布，姆萨布。”

我坐在一头狮子身上，对他们喊回去：“是的，我在这里。”

他们的嗓门大起来，胆子也粗了：“先生把狮子打死了吗？两头都死了吗？”发现确实如此后，他们几乎立刻全聚了过来，像一群夜间活动的小野兔，上蹿下跳。他们当即为这件事编了一首歌；歌是这样唱的：“三枪。两狮。三枪。两狮。”一边唱，一边还为它添枝加叶，修饰美化，一个接一个用清越高亢的声音独唱：“三声好枪，两只强壮的暴虐迦梨(7)狮。”随后同声合唱一首壮怀激烈的字母歌作为副歌：“ABCD……”因为他们是直接从学校跑来的，脑子里装满了课本智慧。

很短的时间里，许多人来到这里，有加工厂里的工人们、附近村寨的棚民们，还有提着防风灯的用人们。大家围着狮子站成一圈，叽叽喳喳谈论着，卡努侠和马夫带来了刀，开始剥狮皮。其中一张，后来我送给了印度长老。普莱·辛格也现身当场，肥大的睡袍衬出他难以置信的瘦小，一把厚厚的大黑胡子上，闪耀着一抹甜蜜的印度式笑容，他一开口，就激动得结结巴巴起来。他满腔热切，一心想要我把狮油留给他，对他的族人来说，那是珍贵的药物——从他对我的比手画脚来看，我相信那是治疗风湿和阳痿的神药。因此种种，咖啡园里万众欢腾，雨停了，月光安详地普照着所有人。

回家后，朱玛奉酒开瓶。我们全身湿透，满是泥浆和血迹，脏得无法入座，只能站在餐厅的炉火前，三口两口饮尽了杯中冒着泡泡、嘶嘶作响的美酒。我们一句话也没说。这一次狩猎中，我们同心合力，成为一体，再没有什么是需要用语言向对方表达的了。

我们的冒险经历给朋友们都带来了莫大的乐趣。不过后来我们在俱乐部跳舞的时候遇见了老布尔佩特先生，他气得整晚都不和我们说话。




我想，我农场岁月中最瑰丽、最惊心动魄的乐趣，势必要归功于丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿：我曾与他一道，在非洲上空飞行。在这里少有道路甚至根本没有，但你可以在平原上降落，飞行变成你生活中真实且至关重要的一件事，开启了一个新世界。丹尼斯带来了他的蛾式飞机(8)；它可以在离大宅只几分钟路的农场平原上降落，我们几乎每天都会飞行。

当你飞越过非洲高原时，视野无比开阔壮观，光与色的组合令人惊叹，有无穷的演变，阳光下绿野上的彩虹、壁立如雪山的庞大云团、狂野肆虐的黑色风暴，都围绕在你身边奔跑起舞。急雨如鞭，斜斜而下，周围一片白茫茫。说到飞行的种种体验，我总有词穷之感，想必随着时间过去，会渐渐有新鲜词汇发明出来。当你飞越东非大裂谷、苏斯瓦山和隆戈诺特火山群的时候，感觉已经飞得太远太远，飞到了月球背面。也有些时候，你飞得够低，能把平原上的动物看得清清楚楚，油然而生出上帝的心得——当他刚刚创造万物，还不曾派亚当为它们命名。

不过，并不是眼前所见，而是这项活动令你欢欣鼓舞，飞行本身带给飞行员无上的欢喜与荣耀。城镇居民的生活该有多悲惨，形同奴役，所有的行动都是在单维直线上；他们沿直线行走，仿佛是被绳子牵着。从线到面，渡入两维平面，能在田野上漫步，或者穿过小树林，对被奴役者来说，是天翻地覆的解放，一如法国大革命。但只有在天上，你才获得了三维空间的完全自由；熬过漫长的流放岁月，为思乡而魂牵梦萦的心投入了太空的怀抱。靠着万有引力定律和时间的永恒法则而行。

……在生命的绿色丛林里，

嬉戏如被驯化的猛兽，无人知道，

它们能有多温柔！



每一次，当我坐在飞机上腾空而起，向下俯瞰，我会意识到：我已经脱离了地面的束缚，顿悟到一种伟大新发现的感受。“懂了，”我想到，“就是这样。现在我都懂了。”




一天，丹尼斯和我飞翔到了纳特龙湖。它在农场东南方向一百五十千米处，比农场地势要低一千二百米，海拔高度为六百米。纳特龙湖是出产提取碳酸钠的地方，湖底和湖滨都像白花花的混凝土，带着强烈的酸咸味道。

天色碧蓝，但当我们从沃野飞抵乱石嶙峋、光秃秃的低地上空，眼前所有的色泽都蒙上了一层焦黑感。极目下视，一览无余的荒地仿佛纹理精细的龟甲。而在最中间，湖面突如其来地浮现。透过湖水，垩白的湖底闪闪发光。从空中看去，湖水蓝得刺眼，如此咄咄逼人，几乎难以置信，你必须对它先闭上一会儿双眼；这片水域静静躺在苍凉褐色的大地上，像一方巨大晶莹的海蓝宝石。我们飞得很高，现在开始下降，随着降落，我们墨蓝墨蓝的倒影，就在下方明蓝的湖面上浮浮沉沉。上千只火烈鸟在这里栖息，虽然我不知道它们如何在盐水湖里生存——这里肯定是没有鱼的。我们靠近时，它们四散飞去，组成一个个圆环或扇形，像落日的光芒，像丝绸或瓷器上精美的中国纹样，形态各异，变化万千，引得我们看个不休。

我们降落在惨白的湖滨上，湖滨像烤炉一样白热，为了躲避阳光，我们在飞机机翼下的阴凉处吃午饭。手臂一旦伸到阴影外，就会被灼热的日头晒伤。我们随身带着啤酒一同降落，啤酒刚拿出来时还清凉可口，但如果不在十五分钟内喝完，它就会烫得像一杯热茶。

我们正在吃，一队马赛武士出现在地平线上，迅速向我们走来。他们一定在远处就窥见了飞机降落，决定凑上前看个究竟。任何距离的徒步远行，哪怕是在这样滚烫的地方，对马赛人来说都寻常。他们鱼贯前行，一个个全身赤裸，高高瘦瘦，武器在手中闪闪发光；在黄灰色的沙地上，他们黑得像煤块似的。每个人的脚下，都躺着一个小小的黑影紧紧跟随，除了我们自己的影子之外，在这片旷野上，目力所及处只能看到这些黑影。走到我们面前，他们一行五人排成队，开始交头接耳谈论起飞机和我们。仅仅一代之前，与马赛人遭遇，对我们来说将会是致命的。过了一会儿，他们中的一个人向前与我们说话。他们只会说马赛语，而我们对这种语言只知道一鳞半爪，沟通很快就继续不下去，他走回伙伴中，几分钟后，他们全体向后转，背对着我们，一列纵队开步走，白茫无尽、炽焰般灼热的盐碱地在他们身前展开来。

“你想不想飞到奈瓦沙去？”丹尼斯说，“不过途中处处都非常险峻，哪里都不能落脚。所以我们得飞得很高，保持在三千六百米的高度。”

从纳特龙湖到奈瓦沙的旅程正是康德所说的“自在之物”(9)。我们一路笔直向前，全程都在三千六百米的高度。这么高，低头什么也看不到。在纳特龙湖我摘下了小羊皮帽，此刻高空的风刮擦在我的额头上，冰水般透骨严寒；我的头发全向后扬起，仿佛头也快被扯下来。事实上，这条路正是大鹏鸟每夜的必经之路，它每只爪子里各拎着一只大象带回家去给它的幼崽(10)，从乌干达飞到阿拉伯，一路风声飒飒。只不过我们方向相反。当你坐在驾驶舱的前方，你面前别无他物，唯有无尽虚空，正如巨灵神带着阿里王子在飞行，把你搁在他摊开的手掌中，而那承载着你一路向前的翅翼正是他的肋生双翅。我们降落在奈瓦沙一位朋友的农场上；一幢幢无比袖珍的小房子，以及房子周围非常小的树木，随着我们下落，看去仿佛全向后倒，背紧贴在地面上。

如果丹尼斯与我没时间长途旅行，便在恩贡山脉做一次短途飞行，通常是在日落时分。那些山川是全世界最美丽的山峰，而从空中俯瞰到的，也许是它们最魅力无穷的一面。山脊无遮无掩地向四座峰顶袒露自己，拔地而起，在飞机旁奔腾不已，有时又陡然沉降，平铺开去，成为小小的草坪。

恩贡山中有野牛。当我还年轻气盛——当时除非把每种非洲野兽都猎杀一只，否则我誓不罢休——我甚至在此地射死过一头。后来，我不再孜孜以求追杀猎物，只满足于观赏，也经常出外只为一见。我在山坡路上的泉边驻营，带着仆人、帐篷和食物等必需品。我在漆黑冰寒的黎明里起床，带上法拉，在长长的野草和灌木丛中摸滚跌爬，只希望有缘看到牛群一眼；但两次我都无功而返。牛群生活在那里，就在我家西边不远处，对农场生活来说，自有其价值。它们是自给自足、天性严肃的邻居，山中的古老贵族，不过现在多少有些被人冷落；它们不曾得到很多关注。

一天下午，我与几个来自北方的朋友坐在户外喝茶，丹尼斯从内罗毕飞过来，从我们头顶上呼啸向西；过了一会儿，他掉了个头返回，在农场附近降落。德拉米尔夫人与我开车去平原，想接他上来，但他不肯从飞机中出来。

“野牛正在山上吃草，”他说，“来吧，去看看它们。”

“我不能去，”我说，“我家里有下午茶聚呢。”

“但我们能在十五分钟里去看一眼它们再回来。”他说。

这听起来像那种梦中才会听到的建议。德拉米尔夫人不喜欢飞行，于是我上了飞机。我们在阳光下飞行，山坡笼罩在一片透明的褐色阴影中，很快飞进山川间，没过多久就从空中看到了野牛。长而曲折的青翠山脊，像一大块带着褶皱的绿花布聚集在每一座山峰四周，在恩贡山脉的一片山坡上，有二十七头野牛在吃草。起先我们看到它们在远远的下方，像一群在地板上悄悄移动的小老鼠，当我们一个猛子扎下去，在山脊上空盘旋着，它们离我们只有四十五米，已经近在射程内；它们心平气和，或三五成群，或孑然一身，我们一头一头点着数。牛群中有一头上了年纪的大黑公牛、一两头年轻公牛和许多小牛。它们漫步着的是一片开阔的草地，与灌木丛靠得很近；一旦有陌生人靠近这片田地，会立刻被看到嗅到，但它们对空中来客毫无防备。我们便一直在它们头顶上飞翔。听到了发动机的轰鸣声，它们停下吃草，但没有哪一头抬头上望。到最后，他们意识到附近有什么东西相当蹊跷；老公牛第一个走到牛群前方，抬起它那近百斤重的牛角，对看不见的敌人展示雄风，四蹄牢牢地钉在地面上——突然间，它开始沿着山脊疾步，不一会儿就变成了小跑。整个家族都跟在它身后，头也不回地狂奔而去，一个急转弯，冲进灌木丛，四蹄扬起无数灰尘和松散的小石块。在丛林中它们驻足观望，一个个挨得很紧密，远望像一块用深灰色石头砌就的山中空地。在这里，它们深信自己藏得很好，不会被看到，所以不必再东跑西躲，但它们逃不开空中飞鸟的眼睛。我们向上拉高，飞远了。仿佛我们是沿着一条隐秘的、不为人知的道路，深入了恩贡山脉的心脏。

当我回到下午茶聚上，石桌上茶壶犹热，烫痛了我的手指。先知穆罕默德也有过类似的体验，他曾打翻一罐水，而天使长加百利带他遨游七重天归来时，罐中的水还不曾流光。

恩贡山上，也有群鹰活动。丹尼斯经常在下午说：“让我们去拜访一下老鹰吧。”有一次，我曾见一只老鹰栖息在山顶的一块石头上，从那里起飞，除此之外，它们的一生似乎都在空中消磨。许多次我们随意追逐着一只苍鹰，机翼向一侧倾斜，我们俩都向这一侧歪倒，须臾又换到另一侧，而我觉得，这种目光犀利的鸟儿不过是同我们嬉戏。一次，当我们与它并肩飞翔，丹尼斯在半空中关掉发动机，我因而听到了苍鹰的唳声。

原住民喜欢飞机，有一段时间在农场上，为它画像成为时尚，我会在厨房或者就是在厨房墙上发现散落的纸张，上面画满了飞机，连字母“ABAK”都细心地照描了下来。但他们对飞机本身及我们的飞行，都并不真的感兴趣。

原住民不喜欢高速，正如我们不喜欢噪音，对他们来说，速度这玩意儿哪怕最好，也难以容忍。他们一向与时间和平共处，排遣光阴或者消磨时间的念头，连想都没想过。事实上你给他们时间越多，他们越乐在其中，如果你吩咐一个基库尤人在你出门的时候为你牵马，你会从他脸上看出来，他希望你这一趟门出很久很久。他不会费事去打发时间，他只是坐下来，自得其乐。

同样，原住民对任何一种机械或者技术工作都绝无共鸣。年轻一代有些人受欧洲人对摩托车的热爱影响，也迷上摩托车，但一位基库尤老人对我说，他们会早夭。看来他是正确的，因为变节总来自该民族最弱的一环。开化世界的诸多发明里，深受原住民赞叹和倾慕的，是火柴、自行车和步枪，但当他们一谈起母牛来，这一切会立刻被抛到九霄云外。

克东谷的弗兰克·格兰斯沃尔德-威廉斯带了一个马赛人到英国去当马夫，后来告诉我，马赛人到埠后一星期，就在海德公园骑马了，自如得像个土生土长的老伦敦。马赛人回非洲后，我问他在英国发现了什么好东西没有。他表情庄严，认真思索着我的问题，良久才纯粹出于礼貌地答道：白人们造的桥梁还不错。

我从不曾见过老年原住民流露出怀疑或者羞耻外的其他感情。对他们来说，万事万物的行动都是自然而然的，人力不可强迫，大自然也无能为力。人类的心智宁愿对巫术视而不见，一如避开某些不体面的事物。有时迫于无奈，也会借助巫术的威力，但对其内部的运行机制也无所作为，就像无人会试着拷问巫婆，逼她交出秘酒的配方一样。

一次，丹尼斯与我飞行归来，降落在农场的草坪上，一个老掉了牙的基库尤人走过来跟我们说话：

“你们今天飞得真高呀，”他说，“我们都看不见你们了，只能听见飞机蜜蜂似的嗡嗡嗡。”

我同意，我们确实飞得很高。

“那你们看到上帝了吗？”他问。

“不，恩德韦蒂，”我说，“没有看到。”

“啊哈，那你们还不够高呢，”他说，“但是现在告诉我：你们觉得你们能飞得够高，看到他老人家吗？”

“我不知道，恩德韦蒂。”我说。

“那你呢，先生，”他转向丹尼斯，“你怎么想？你能坐着你的飞机飞得够高，飞到上帝那么高吗？”

“说实话，我不知道。”丹尼斯说。

“那么，”恩德韦蒂说，“我就不明白，为什么你们两个还要飞了。”

移民手记





萤火虫


高原上，当雨季结束，六月的第一个星期来临，夜间开始变凉，而林间出现了萤火虫。

某一夜，你会看见两三只萤火虫飘浮在晴朗的夜空中，宛如胆大妄为的孤星，时高时低，仿佛随波逐流，抑或在频频屈膝。依着飞行的节奏，它们的荧荧灯火忽明忽暗。你可以抓住一只这种小飞虫，让它在你掌心闪烁，发出一种异样的光芒，一种神秘的讯号，将它周围的一小圈空气染成活色生香的幽幽绿光。第二夜，林间会聚满成百上千只萤火虫。

出于某种原因，它们总保持在某一个高度，离地面一米多。不把它们想象成一群六七岁的孩子是几乎不可能的，这些孩子捧着蜡烛，在黑暗森林里跑进跑出，小小的烛头是在魔火中蘸燃，他们兴高采烈地上蹦下跳，边跑边欢喜雀跃，开开心心地挥着他们小小的微光火炬。森林里充斥着野性不羁、嬉笑不已的生命，又呈现一派祥和幽静。





生活之路


当我还是个小孩子，有人给我看一幅画——一种实时完成的图画，就在你面前画出来，画画的人一边画，还一边给你讲故事。每一次，这个故事都用同样的语言讲出来。



从前，有一个小小的圆房子，它有一个圆窗户，前面有一个小小的三角形花园，房子里住着一个人。

房子不远处有一个池塘，里面有很多鱼。



一天晚上，这个人被一种可怕的噪音吵醒了，摸黑出门想知道发生了什么事。他沿着小路走到池塘。

说到这里，说故事的人开始画出这个人走过的道路，就像在描绘军队的行军图一样。



他首先跑向南。在那里，他摔倒在一块路中间的大石头上，再往前走，他栽进了沟里，起来，又栽进沟里，再起来，栽进第三个沟里，终于爬了出来。



然后他发现自己弄错了，于是回身往北跑。但跑到这儿，噪音又好像是从南边传来的，他又去南面。先是摔倒在一块路中央的大石头上，再往前走，栽进了沟里，起来，又栽进沟里，再起来，栽进第三个沟里，终于爬了出来。



现在他清楚地听到声音是从池塘那端传来的。他冲过去，发现堤坝上有一个大洞，水和里面的鱼，都在从洞里涌出来。他立刻着手堵洞，大功告成后，回屋上床。



到了第二天早晨，这个人从他的小圆窗户看出去——这个故事讲完了，要有多稀奇古怪就有多稀奇古怪——他看到了什么？——

一只鹳！

很高兴有人对我讲过这个故事，使我在需要的时刻能记起它。故事里的人被残酷地捉弄，他走的路上，处处都是障碍。他一定想过：“怎样的起起落落！什么样的坏运气在作祟！”他势必十分困惑：这百般折磨，到底所为何来；他不知道那其实是一只鹳。饱经磨难的他，从不放弃心中的目标，任何事都不曾令他转身回家，他走完了应走之路，始终坚持信念。他得到了应有的回报。早晨，他看到了鹳。那时，他一定笑得很大声。

这困境，我所身处的这黑暗深渊，也是哪一只鸟的利爪吧？当我人生的图卷完工，是否我，或者其他人，能看到一只鹳？

“啊，女王，您令我品尝的，是那无法言传的苦痛。”(1)正如特洛伊城在烈火中焚烧(2)，七年的流放，十三艘好船失事。最终的结局会如何？“无与伦比的优雅，尊贵的威仪，以及甜美的温柔。”

当你读基督教会《使徒信经》(3)第二部分时，你会感到迷惑：“他被钉在十字架上，死而安葬；他下降阴府，第三日自死者中复活；他升了天……要从天降来。”

这是怎样的起起落落，如故事里的人所遭受的磨难一样可怕。这一切会结出什么果子呢？——传遍半个世界的《使徒信经》第二部分。

猛兽的救赎


一战期间，我的经理一直负责为军队采购牛只。他告诉我，他曾经下到马赛人居留区，从马赛人手里买过多头牛犊，那是马赛牛和野牛的混血后代。家畜与野生动物杂交是否可行，始终颇有争议；许多人都试图用非洲矮脚马与斑马和大马繁育，但我本人从不曾见过它们的杂交后代。不过我的经理向我保证说，这些牛确实有一半野牛血统。马赛人告诉过他，它们的成长期比普通牛长很多，而马赛人虽以它们为荣，此次也很高兴有机会摆脱它们，因为它们野性难驯。

后来发现，训练这些公牛拉车或者犁车是艰苦异常的工作。其中一只年轻力壮的小公牛给我的经理和他手下的原住民牛倌带来无尽麻烦。它对人们发起狂暴的攻击，撞断牛轭，口吐白沫，咆哮如雷；如果把它拴起来，它就拼命刨土，弄得黑土四溅如厚厚的乌云；它充血的双眼瞪得大大的，血就从它鼻孔流下来。双方角力直到最后，人和这头猛兽一样，精疲力竭，酸痛的身体上大汗淋漓。

“为了瓦解这头公牛的斗志，”我的经理这样说，“我把它扔进牛栏，四条腿紧紧地捆在一起，用缰绳绑住口鼻。即使这般，它躺在地上一声都不能出，还从鼻子里喷出大股大股滚烫的蒸气和可怕的哼哼声，喉咙里也一直咕噜咕噜在叹息。我巴望着能看到它在牛轭下乖乖工作很多很多年。我回帐篷上床了，梦里都是这头黑牛的身影。然后我被一阵巨大的喧哗声惊醒，狗在吠，原住民在喊叫，在牛栏边哭天抢地。两个牛倌进到帐篷里来，全身颤抖着告诉我，有一头狮子正在袭击公牛。我们带着一盏灯跑过去，我本人还扛着枪。当我们靠近牛栏时，嘈杂声渐渐减弱消失。在灯光下，我看见一个有斑点的东西正夺路而逃。是一只花豹造访了这只被缚的牛，吃掉了它的右后腿。我们永远不会看到它负轭的样子了。”

“于是，”我的经理说，“我举起枪，打死了小公牛。”





埃萨的故事


一战期间，我雇了个厨师名叫埃萨，他是个老头子，性情温和，通情达理。一天我正在内罗毕的麦金农食杂店买茶和调料，一位锥子脸的小个子女士走到我面前，对我说，她知道埃萨在给我做事；我答确实如此。“但他以前是给我做事的，”女士说，“我要他回来。”我说很抱歉，爱莫能助，恐怕没法让他回去。“哦，我不这么想。”她说，“我先生是政府官员。麻烦你回家时通知一下埃萨，说我希望他回来。否则他会被送到运输军团去。据我所知，”她加了一句，“没有埃萨，你的用人也绰绰有余。”

这段小插曲，我没有立刻告诉埃萨。到了第二天晚上，我才想起这事，告诉他我遇到了他以前的女主人，还有她对我说的话。出乎我意料，埃萨顿时大惊失色，吓得魂飞魄散。“噢，您为什么不马上告诉我呢，姆萨！”他说，“那位女士跟您说的话，她是真干得出来的，我今晚就得与您告辞了。”

“那都是瞎说的，”我说，“我不认为他们真能这样对付你。”

“上帝助我，”埃萨说，“我真怕可能已经来不及了。”

“可是我需要厨师呀，我该怎么办？”我问他。

“嗯，”埃萨说，“我要是去了运输军团，或者生命垂危，也一样不能给你当厨师。我敢保证，这都是眼目前就会发生的。”

那段日子，他们都太害怕被送到运输军团去，所以我说的话，埃萨一个字也不想听。他向我借了防风灯，连夜赶往内罗毕，随身带着一个布包裹，那就是他在这世上的全部财产。

埃萨一走就是一年。这段日子里，我在内罗毕见过他几次，还有一次跟他在内罗毕公路上遇个正着。他老了，瘦了，脸上皱纹丛生，就在这一年里，他黑黑圆圆的头顶上长出了灰发。在城里，他不曾停步与我攀谈，但在公路上遇到那一次，我停了车，他放下扛在头顶上的鸡笼，立定脚跟，和我好好聊了聊。

他一如既往地轻声细语，但同时他也全变了，变得难以接触；在我们谈话期间，他始终神色恍惚，仿佛身在这里，心在远方。他被命运苛待过，仿佛惊弓之鸟，不得不仰赖那些我无从知晓的力量，经此种种后，他变得乖顺，也可能是更无思无虑了。仿佛与我对话的，是一位刚刚出家的老熟人，正在修道院的见习期。

他问起我农场事务，就像原住民仆人通常想的那样，认定一旦他不在场，同侪们会想尽办法慢待白人主家。“战争何时才会结束呢？”他问我。我答，人家跟我说，不会太久了。“如果还要打十年，”他说，“你一定得知道，我肯定会忘掉那些你教我烧的菜。”

在横穿旷野的大道上，这位矮小的基库尤老人想法与布里拉·萨瓦林(1)不谋而合，后者说过，如果法国大革命再持续五年，蔬菜炖鸡的烹饪艺术就将失传。

很明显埃萨的难过主要是站在我的立场上，为了终止他的怜悯之情，我岔开话题，问他近况如何。他反复思量我的问题，开口之前，有万千思绪要一一整理。“你还记得吗，姆萨比？”他最终说道，“你以前说过，印度木材承包商的牛每天都得拉车，从来不能像农场牛那样有一整天的休息。现在，和那位夫人在一起，我就像一头印度木材承包商的牛。”他说着，眼光看向别处，仿佛满怀疚意——原住民很少会对动物抱有同情；我关于印度牛的言论，很可能他曾觉是遥不可及，但现在轮到他自己了，他自发地说了出来。对他来说，这几乎是不可思议的一件事。

战争期间，令我烦不胜烦的是，所有信件，无论是发出去的还是收进来的，都要由一位内罗毕的瑞典检察官开封检查，他个子小子，总是睡眼惺忪。在我的信里，向来连一个字的疑点都没发现过，相反，我怀疑，他在单调的日常事务里，对我笔下提到的人物产生了兴趣，阅读我的信，就像阅读报纸上的系列报道。知道他会读到，我总在私人信件里加几句关于检察官的话，声称战后将对他如何如何。战争结束时，他可能还记得这威胁，抑或他的“本我”被唤醒，心生悔意；反正，他派了一个跑腿人到农场上，送来了休战协议的消息。跑腿人登门的时候，我正独个儿在家；送走那人后，我信步走到树林里，林中一片静谧——想到法国和比利时佛兰德前线也是如此，真令人讶异——所有枪支此刻都沉默。万籁俱寂里，欧洲和非洲都仿佛触手可及，似乎你可以沿着这林中小径，一路走到法国的薇米岭。当我回到家，我看到门外站着一个人影。是埃萨，带着他的包裹。他马上就告诉我：他回来了，还要送一件礼物给我。

埃萨的礼物是一幅画，镶在玻璃镜面的框里，画面上是一棵用钢笔蘸墨绘制的树，笔致非常精细，上百片树叶，片片通透碧绿，各用红墨水写着一个纤小的阿拉伯字母，连起来是一句话。我猜应该是《古兰经》里的一句箴言，但到底是什么意思，埃萨解释不出来，他只是不停用袖子擦镜面，向我保证这确实是件宝贝。他告诉我，这幅画，是这备受磨难的一年里，他托内罗毕一位穆斯林阿訇完成的，老阿訇不知道耗了多少时间多少分秒，才一笔一笔绘制完成。

埃萨一直留在我家——直到他死。

鬣蜥蜴


在野生动物保护区，我数次偶然遇见鬣蜥蜴，躺在河底平坦的大石头上晒太阳。它们的形状并不好看，但我几乎想象不出来有任何物件，比它们的色泽更明艳。它们闪耀着，如一堆稀世珍宝，或者古老教堂窗户上拆下来的一格彩玻璃。当你靠近，它们嗖一声逃走，一道碧蓝、翠绿和葡萄紫的光影从石堆上掠过。它们不见了，各种颜色仍在它们身后闪烁，一如彗星明亮的彗尾。

我打死过一只鬣蜥蜴。当时以为能拿它的皮制些漂亮的小玩意儿。随后，一件奇怪的事发生了，那一幕我永远忘不掉。我走过去时，它躺在石头上死透了，事实上，就在那寥寥几步里，它渐渐黯淡，变得苍白，仿佛随着一记长叹，所有的颜色都涌出它的身体，当我终于摸到它，它已经跟一块混凝土一样灰蒙蒙暗漆漆。是它体内涌动的热血，让它绽放出这所有的绚烂光彩。此刻，生命火焰熄灭，灵魂飞驰而去，死去的鬣蜥蜴也不过就是个沙袋。

之后我多多少少又打死过几只鬣蜥蜴，但我时常想起的，还是保护区的那一只。一次，在梅鲁(1)，我看到一位原住民少女戴着一只手镯，两寸宽的皮条，密密麻麻镶满了蓝绿色的小珠子，珠子颜色略有深浅，碧绿、明蓝和群青一一在列。它是有生命的事物，光辉灿烂，仿佛正伏在她手臂上呼吸。我想拥有它，便叫法拉从姑娘手里买下了它。不料，它一旦来到我自己手腕上，魅力瞬间荡然无存，现在它什么都不是了，一个小小的、廉价的、随手买来的小玩意儿。它曾经展现的美色，是松石绿与“暗肤色”——那明快、甜美、褐黑色、像炭又像黑陶的原住民肤色——的二重唱，正是这给手镯以生命力。

在彼里马里茨堡的动物博物馆，一个展位陈列着一条填充制成的深水鱼标本，在它身上，我见到与皮手环一式一样的颜色组合，使它虽死犹生；我不由想到，在那深深海底，是什么生命如此美好，让物种这般生机勃勃又轻盈。我伫立在梅鲁街头，凝视着我苍白的手腕，那圈死气沉沉的手环，一如高贵事物刚被玷污，又似真理正被压制。我无限伤感，恍惚间我想起小时候读过的一本书，上面的大英雄这样说道：“我完灭了所有敌人，但此刻围绕我脚边的全是萋萋荒冢。”

在异国他乡，面对陌生的物种，人们应该掂量一下，是否让它们活着比杀死它们更有价值。对东非居民，我想进言一句：“为了保留你们心底眼中的美好，不要射杀鬣蜥蜴。”

法拉与《威尼斯商人》


一次，收到故乡朋友的一封信，里面说到并向我描述新上演的《威尼斯商人》。晚上，当我把信一读再读，舞台景象如映眼帘，充斥全屋。我情难自禁，喊来法拉和他聊了起来，把这出喜剧的剧情一一说给他听。

所有阿拉伯血统的人都喜欢听人说故事，法拉也不例外，不过他得先确定只有我们两人在家时，才会纵容自己听。仆人们都回自家棚屋去了，即便经过农场的人从窗外看向屋里，也会认定我与他正在讨论家务：我滔滔不绝，他在桌子另一端听得毕恭毕敬，眼神凝重。

法拉对安东尼奥、巴萨尼奥与夏洛克之间的纠葛产生了莫大的兴趣。故事里有数目庞大、纷繁复杂的交易，多多少少游走在法律边缘，这正合索马里人心意。关于那一磅肉的条款，他追问了我一两个问题。显然，这对他来说不同寻常，但并不有悖情理：这种事，人是干得出来的。从这里开始，故事多了血的味道——他兴致越发高昂。当鲍西娅在舞台上现身，他竖起耳朵；我猜在他眼中，她就是他本族的女子法蒂玛(1)，意志坚定，灵巧，令人着迷，令数不尽的男子折服。有色人种从不在故事里辨别是非，他们的兴趣只在情节本身是否曲折独到；现实生活中索马里人价值观浓厚，天生抱有义愤心，但从不用在虚构世界里。因此，在这里，法拉的同情全集中在夏洛克身上，怜悯他的人财两空；对他的失败，法拉很不服气。

“什么？”他说，“犹太人放弃索赔？他不应该这样做。这磅肉应该属于他，他花了这么多钱，这一点儿也不过分。”

“但他还能怎么做呢？”我反问道，“他一滴血都不能流出来呀。”

“姆萨比，”法拉说，“他可以用一把烧得通红滚烫的刀。用那个就不会出血。”

“但是，”我说，“他仅仅能取一磅肉，多一分少一厘都不允许。”

“还有人会被这个吓倒？”法拉说，“尤其是犹太人。他可以一次就切一点点，手边放一个小天平随时秤秤，直到正好切完一磅。难道这个犹太人没有朋友给他支招吗？”

所有索马里人的表情都有极度戏剧化的成分。法拉虽然不动声色，举止一毫不变，现在却不觉面目狰狞，仿佛他已经活生生矗立在威尼斯法庭上，为他的朋友或者合伙人夏洛克两肋插刀，与安东尼奥的朋友们及威尼斯总督本人面面相对。他眼光闪烁，上下打量着商人安东尼奥的身体，后者的胸膛已袒露在刀锋前。

“看，姆萨比，”他说，“他可以取一小点，非常小的一小点。他能让那个人痛不欲生，在他得到一磅肉之前受很长时间罪。”

我说：“可是在故事里，犹太人放弃了。”

“是的，那可真遗憾，姆萨比。”法拉说。

伯恩茅斯(1)的上流社会


我的一位移民邻居在老家曾经是位医生。一次我仆人的太太难产垂危，正值雨季，道路被冲垮。我去不了内罗毕，便写信给他，请他给我个面子，大发慈悲救救她。他真是大好人，顶着雷电交加、倾盆而下的热带暴雨来了，母婴双双得救。

后来他写了一封信给我，说明虽然他应我之邀，为原住民出诊，但我想必明白，这类事不可再度发生。他自信满满地认为，当他提醒我在伯恩茅斯他只为上流社会看病时，我就能充分理解这一点。

有关骄傲


与野生动物保护区毗邻，在篱笆外就有大型猛兽的出没，给农场染上了一种独特的气氛，仿佛与我们做邻居的乃是一位伟大的帝王。不可一世的事与物就围绕在我们身边，近在咫尺，触手可及。

蛮人以自傲而得意，却厌恶或者怀疑其他人的骄傲。我甘愿属于文明社会，我乐意珍视我敌人的骄傲、我仆人的骄傲以及我爱人的骄傲；我的家将满怀着谦卑，是这蛮荒之地一处文明据点。

骄傲是对上帝创造我们时所怀期许的信仰。骄傲者能意识到这期许，并立志将其实现。他不为了花天酒地或者舒适生活而奔忙，因这与上帝对他的期许毫不相干。对他而言，成功便是将上帝期许贯彻始终，并对自己的命运深为庆幸。正如一个好公民在为社会尽职尽责中找到快乐，骄傲者在完成使命中实现幸福。

全无骄傲的人，是对上帝创造他们时的期许一无所知的人。有时他们会令你感到怀疑，可能上帝对他们期望值不高，抑或这期望已经失落，谁能重新找回它？他们于是接受其他人的人生准则，视之为自己的成功模式，全盘吸收旁人的快乐，甚至旁人的自我，照搬到自己的日复一日中。可想而知，他们在命运面前战栗不已。

对上帝骄傲的敬爱至高无上，爱邻人的骄傲一如爱你自己的。狮的骄傲是：不被圈禁在动物园。你爱犬的骄傲是：别让它们膘肉徒生。爱你的追随者们的骄傲，别让他们陷入自怨自怜。

爱被征服民族的骄傲，容他们光耀其父其母。





牛


星期六下午是农场最安乐的时光。首先，直到星期一下午，都不会有新邮件了，再不会有烦心事能打扰到我们，这就像是在农场周围修起了城廊，庇护了一切。其次，每个人都在瞻望星期日，可以放松一下，或者玩一整天，棚民们可以在自留地上劳作。而每当想到星期六的牛群，比想什么都让我高兴。我常常在傍晚六点钟信步走到牛栏去，那时它们已经结束了一天的工作，吃过一两个小时的草，正在回牛栏的路上。明天，我心里想，它们就可以什么也不干，好好地吃一天草。

我们在农场上有一百三十二头牛，组成八支工作小队，还有几头机动。此刻，落日把尘土染成金色，它们排成长长一列，穿过草原回家来，步伐从容，一如它们做一切事；我安闲地坐在围场的护栏上，心平气和地抽着烟，端详着它们。一个个走来的，是“恩约西”、“恩古福”、“法如”，还有“穆萨古”——意为“白人”。车夫也经常用白人的名字来命名牛队，“德拉米尔”是牛的常用名。又来了老“马林达”，我在众牛中最喜欢的一头大个子黄公牛；它的皮肤上有奇怪的斑斑块块，形如阴影，像海星似的。或许它就以身上的图案而得名，因为“马林达”意为“腰裙”。

在文明国度里，所有人对贫民窖居民都抱着深长的疚意，阵阵心痛，想到他们，便心生恻隐，而在非洲，当你想到牛时，你会满怀疚意，阵阵心痛。对于农场上的牛们，我的感受，想来便是国王对自己的贫民窖居民所持的情怀：“你们就是我，我就是你们。”

在非洲的欧式文明进程中，牛肩上有最沉重的负担。每一块需要开垦的荒原，都是它们开垦出来的，喘息着，在没过膝的烂泥地里拖着犁，长鞭在它们头顶盘旋着。每一条需要铺筑的道路，都是它们铺筑的，在车夫们的咆哮嘶喊声中，拖着铁器和工具，跋涉过沙尘间的小径，踏遍高高的野草，在它们面前，是没有路的荒野。拂晓之前，就被套上轭，沿着高高的山脉上上下下，穿峡谷过河床，白日里骄阳似火，它们挥汗如雨。鞭痕烙在它们的两肋及侧腹处，你常常会看到有些牛只，一只甚至两只眼睛被刀割似的长长鞭梢抽瞎了。许多印度人和白人包工头手下的赶车牛日复一日地工作，终其一生，从不知道何谓安息日(1)。

我们对公牛的所作所为，何等令人惊诧。公牛总是怒气冲冲，瞪着眼珠，蹄子狂躁地刨土，对一切进入它视野的东西都暴跳如雷——它仍然拥有属于它的生活，鼻子里喷的热气是内在的火焰，生殖器里是蓬勃的新生命；它的日子充满对生命的渴望和满足。这一切被我们扫荡一空，作为回报，我们宣称它存在的目的就是为我们所役。牛和我们一道，每日里忙活着，永远拖着沉重的负担，是生物却不再有生命，仅仅是供我们使唤的活物。它们有紫罗兰色的清澈双眼，总是雾蒙蒙的，柔软的口鼻，丝绸般光滑的耳朵，无论什么情况下都顺从木讷，也有时仿佛若有所思。

我在非洲期间，法律禁止未安装刹车的大小牛车上路，本地所有长距离下坡路上，都要求使用刹车，但法律变成一纸空文。路上半数的大小牛车都没有安装刹车，装了刹车的也形同虚设。因此，下山对牛来说辛苦至极，它们得用身体抵住满载的大车，在重负下，头猛后仰，犄角都顶到了高高的牛背，侧腹风箱似的一起一伏。我多次看到木材商的牛车在恩贡山路上，一辆接一辆驶往内罗毕，像一条长长的毛毛虫，在森林保护区的山道下坡时走得很快，牛只在车前跌跌撞撞，脚步左右剧烈地歪斜。我也曾在山脚下，见过它们在大车的重量下踉跄栽倒。

牛这样想：“这就是人生，世界就是这样。活着就是受罪，受罪。忍耐就是一切——别无他途。拉车下山千难万难，有如生死一搏。无可奈何呀。”

如果大车的主人，那些痴肥的内罗毕印度商人，肯花两卢比买个刹车装上，并让刹车保持在良好状态；或者躺在车顶上懒散的年轻原住民车夫，肯稍微为牛们着想，翻身下车扳上刹车——假如有。这对牛儿们都是有帮助的，它们就能平稳地走在下山路上。但牛儿们不知道这回事，它们只能日复一日，对环境做着不屈不挠却茫无出路的反抗。

两个种族


非洲白种人与黑种人之间的关系，在许多方面都与两性之间的关系近似。

如果告知任一性别的人，他/她们在异性的生活中其实微不足道，倒是异性在他/她们的存在中举足轻重，他/她们一定会震惊，备受伤害。若告知情郎或者丈夫，在妻子或情妇的生命中他可有可无，远不如妻子或情人对自己的影响，他会困惑不解，继而愤愤不平。若告知妻子或情妇，在丈夫或情郎的生涯里，她无关紧要，反之丈夫或情郎对她来说弥足珍贵，她准会暴跳如雷。

那些实话实说的老生常谈，那些男人们的故事，从不曾到过女人们耳朵里，适足于证明此理论；而女人间的闲谈——当她们结伴而坐，知道没有男人在旁听时，也一样佐证了它的真实性。

白种人向你说起的关于原住民仆人的故事，反映了同样的姿态。如果告诉他们，在原住民生活中，他们根本不算一回事儿，反而是原住民在左右他们的生活，他们定会大发雷霆，心里愤愤不平。

而假设你跟原住民说，他们在白人的生活中只占据微乎其微的一角，恰恰是白人对他们影响巨大，他们会对你哈哈大笑，你说的话一个字都不信。或许在原住民的圈子里，故事正在不胫而走，被众口相传，都在证明白人对基库尤人或者卡维朗多人是多么全心依赖，所有事都指靠他们。





战时的远征


一战爆发的时候，我丈夫和农场上的两位瑞典助手自愿参军，奔赴德军前线，那儿有德拉米尔勋爵组织的临时情报机构。我孤单单一个人在农场上。然而没多久，就开始有闲言碎语说，要让本地白人妇女们集中居住于营地，避免她们遭受原住民可能的威胁。那时我彻底给吓坏了，想：如果我得在女士集中营待好几个月——谁知道战争要打多久——我会死的。几天后我逮着个机会出门，和我们的邻居，一位年轻的瑞典农夫，一道去了基加贝，铁路沿线地势较高处的一个小站。我们负责搭建营地，接收跑腿人从前线带下来的消息，用电报传给内罗毕的司令部。

在基加贝，我的帐篷邻近车站，就在一堆为铁路机车提供燃料的柴火堆中间。无论昼夜，任何时刻，只要跑腿人抵达，我都会和果阿族站长一道忙起来。站长身量不高，性情温和，而且完全不受周围战争气氛影响，对知识有一种如饥似渴的热情。他问我许多关于丹麦的问题，还让我教了他几句丹麦语，觉得说不定有朝一日能派上大用场。他有一个10岁的小儿子，叫作维克多。有天，往车站的路上，隔着走廊的栅格窗，我听见他正在教维克多语法：“维克多，什么是代名词？——什么是代名词，维克多？——你不知道？——我告诉你五百次了！”

前线部队不断要求输送供给品和军火。我丈夫写信给我，指示我尽快送去满满四牛车物资。他写道：但我绝不能不安排白人押车就任车上路，因为谁也不知道德国人在什么地方，而马赛人也因战争的消息躁动不安，整天在居留区四处游荡。那段日子，大家都疑神疑鬼，认定满世界都是德国人，还在基加贝的铁路桥上安插了哨兵，以防敌人炸桥。

我雇了一位名叫克拉波若特的年轻南非白人作押车员，但当货已装好，一天晚上他被当作德国人逮捕了。他不是德国人，并且有凭有据，能够自证，所以没多久就被开释，他随即改了名字。刹那间，我从他的被捕事件中，赫然看到了上帝之手：现在除我之外，再无别人能押运车队翻山越岭了！黎明拂晓，古老的群星还高挂在天上，我们沿着基加贝山脉的漫漫长路前行，脚下是马赛人居留区的浩瀚原野，在熹微晨光里呈现出一片铁灰，系在牛车上的灯摇晃着，伴随着呼喝声此起彼落，鞭声四起。我有四辆大车，每辆配有十六头牛，还另外有五头牛后备。与我同行的，是二十一个基库尤小伙子和三个索马里人：法拉、扛枪人伊斯梅尔，另有一位老厨子也叫伊斯梅尔，是位气度高贵的老人。我的狗黄昏走在我身边。

真遗憾，警察逮捕克拉波若特时，也抓走了他的骡子。我在整个基加贝都没能找回它，以至于起初几天，我只能在车后飞扬的尘土里步行。幸而没几天，我便在居留区遇到了一个人，从他那里买了一头骡子和鞍鞯，过了几天，又为法拉买了一头。

那一趟远门我走了三个月。我们最后抵达目的地时，正好有一支大型美国远征狩猎队，在前线不远处驻扎过，战争一爆发便匆忙撤退，留下大批储备物资，我们又被派出去运输这批物资。从那之后，车队就不停前往新的驻地。我渐渐熟识了马赛人居留区里的浅滩和水井，能讲几句马赛语了。每一处的道路都糟得一塌糊涂，覆盖着厚厚的尘土，比车身还高的大石头就横在路上。不过后来我们主要是在旷野上穿行。非洲高原上的空气美酒一样清冽，令我微醺，我一直在细细啜饮，这几个月的愉悦，笔墨难以形容。我之前也出门参加过驻猎远征，但这是第一次，我只身在非洲大陆上徜徉。

索马里人与我都对政府财产自觉责任重大，总是担心吊胆，生怕狮子会使牛队有所死伤。狮群就在路上，尾随着运送绵羊和食物的庞大运输队，一直追到边境。黎明时分，当我们驾车出发，能看到长长的一段路上，都是狮群在尘土上留下的新鲜脚印，叠在路上的车辙间。入夜后，牛从车上卸下后，也经常有胆大犯险的狮子凑到帐篷附近，吓坏了的牛群乱作一团，四散逃窜，一旦它们跑到野地里去，就再也找不回来。所以我们在宿营地和牛群周围用合欢树枝搭起高高的栅栏，再彻夜手持步枪，坐在营火旁守夜。

法拉与伊斯梅尔两个人，还有老伊斯梅尔，自觉与文明社会隔了一段安全的距离后，舌头就不那么拘束了，开始说起索马里兰的异人怪事，或《古兰经》和《一千零一夜》中的故事。法拉和伊斯梅尔都出过海，因为索马里人生来就是航海民族，在过往日子里，我相信他们必是红海上叱咤一时的海盗。他们告诉我，每样地面上的生物，在海底都有一模一样的复制品：马、狮、长颈鹿和女人……生活在海洋深处，水手们时有目睹。他们也提到，在索马里兰每条河流的底部，都生活着牡马。月圆之夜，牡马就会到草原上去，与在那里静静吃草的索马里牝马交配，生出来的小马驹俊美无双，奔跑如风。我们坐着聊着，头顶上夜的苍穹渐渐隐去，晨星从东方缓缓浮现。冷洌的空气中，篝火的烟夹带着火星，新砍下的柴枝散发着酸酸的味道。时不时，牛群会突然间大起骚动，跺着地上的土，挤成一堆，在夜空中嗅来嗅去。这种时候，老伊斯梅尔就会爬上满载的车顶，挥舞着手中的灯，观看是不是有什么野兽在栅栏外逡寻，把野兽吓跑。

我们多次狮口脱险。“务必当心西亚瓦。”在路上，我们遇到一位朝北去的运输队长，他如是说，“不要在那里扎营。西亚瓦有两百头狮子。”我们想争取在黄昏前穿过西亚瓦，于是加快了脚步，但“欲速则不达”在远征中比在其他时候更贴切，日落时，最后一辆大车的车轮卡在大石头上，一步也动不得了。我举着灯，其他人努力想把车轮抬出来，一头狮子猛扑向一头离我不足三米远的后备牛。我的枪搁在前方车辆上，我们只好大喊大叫，把鞭子挥得山响，吓跑了狮子。遇袭的牛，被狮子咬住背部拖了好远，狮子松口后跑了回来，但伤势严重，一两天后就死了。

途中，还发生了很多不可思议的事。一次，一头牛喝完了所有的煤油，就在我们眼皮底下死翘翘了，剩下我们连灯也点不了。直到我们在居留区发现了一家印度人开的小店，主人已经弃店而去，奇怪的是，有些商品还保存得好好的，原封未动。

有一个星期，我们的帐篷就扎在马赛族武士的一个大型营地紧邻处，年轻的武士们全身画满战争文身，手持长矛长盾，头戴狮皮头饰，不分昼夜齐聚在我的帐篷旁，打听战争和德国人的消息。我的队伍很喜欢这处营地，可以买牛奶，因为武士们把奶牛群也千辛万苦地带在身边。称为“莱奥尼”的马赛族少年们负责放牛，他们年纪还太小，不能当武士。马赛族武士的女儿们年方少艾，活泼美丽，常常跑到我的帐篷里来喊我，央求我把手镜借给她们互照，在镜前露出两排雪白明亮的牙齿，像一只只愤怒的食肉幼兽。

所有敌人的动向，都要传达给德拉米尔勋爵。但德拉米尔勋爵在居留地上以惊人的速度不断迁徙，神出鬼没，无人知晓能在哪里找到他的营地。在情报工作方面，我无用武之地，但我一直很好奇，想知道他治下的情报系统如何运作。一次，碰巧从德拉米尔勋爵营地外两三千米处路过，我便带上法拉，骑马过去与他喝茶小聚。虽然第二天他就要撤离，他的营地却如同一座城池般挤满了马赛人。他对他们总是很和气，在自己营地里对他们盛情款待，使那里像寓言里的狮子窝(1)：只见进去的脚印却不见出来的。马赛跑腿人送信到德拉米尔勋爵帐中后，从没见他们带着答复重新出现过。德拉米尔勋爵在喧嚣的最中心处，个子小小，银发垂肩，彬彬有礼，庄重安详一如往昔，显得轻松自如。他告诉我战争的全部消息，给我倒茶，并按马赛人的习俗，在茶里加了烟熏过的牛奶。

一路上，我对牛、马具和远征常识的种种无知，随行人员们都以极大的容忍态度原谅了，且像我一样想方设法掩盖。远征途中，他们兢兢业业为我工作着，绝无半句怨言，虽然因为欠缺经验，不管对人对牛，我都提出了过高要求，远超应有的期望值。他们头顶我准备用来洗澡的清水，在草原上长途跋涉；正午时分卸车后，他们用长矛支着毯子，为我搭起遮阳篷，方便我在篷下小作休息。对好战的马赛人他们心怀畏惧，又被德国人的消息弄得心惊肉跳，有很多关于德国人的奇谈怪论正在传播。在这种气氛下，我觉得，亲身涉险的我更像他们的守护天使或者吉祥物。

一战爆发前六个月，我才初次踏上非洲大陆，与冯·莱托-福尔贝克将军同坐一艘船，他现在是德军东非前线最高指挥官。那时我还不晓得他会成为英雄，在旅途中同他成了朋友。我们在蒙巴萨吃过晚餐后，他开拔去坦噶尼喀，我去内地，他送我一张他的骑马戎装照，在照片上题诗如下：

世间的天堂

在马背上；

人生的享受

在女人的胸脯上。



法拉在亚丁接我的时候，见过这位将军，知道他是我的朋友，于是在远征中一直带着那张照片，与钱和其他旅途中的要紧物放在一起，准备万一落入敌人手里，好给德军看。因此他将照片视为珍宝，保存得小心翼翼。

太阳落山后，我们一行人浩浩荡荡来到河边或者泉眼处，卸车露宿，马赛人居留区的夜景此时正美妙。合欢树下，草原一片漆黑，夜色却处处通透——就在我们头顶上，西望苍穹，一颗孤星正在渐渐变大，它即将在夜空中央大放光芒，但此刻仅仅是肉眼可见，在天幕的映衬下，有如柠檬水晶上的一个银点儿。吸进肺里的空气是冰凉的，高高的茅草沾着露水，湿漉漉地垂着头，药草们散发出独有的辛辣芳香。稍过一会儿，四面八方的蝉都将开始欢唱。草原是我，天空是我，几乎不可见的远山是我，疲倦至极的牛群，它们也是我。我的鼻息便是合欢树间那细细的夜风。

三个月后，我突然收到指示：可以回家了。一切事务均上正轨，按部就班地组织起来，正规军队正从欧洲输送过来，相形之下，估计我们的远征队就显得相当不正规。我们回家了，经过曾经露宿处，难免心情沉重。

这次远征久久地留在农场人记忆中。后来我还有过多次远征，但出于某种原因——也许是为政府效力，参与者仿佛有了官派儿；也许是周围的战时氛围——这次不同凡响的远征，让所有亲临其事者都铭记在心。每一个与我同去的人都开始以远征权威自居。

许多年后，他们还会到我家来，同我聊起那次远征，只为了重温记忆，回味那时共同闯过的一个又一个危险。

斯瓦希里数字体系


我刚到非洲时，一个腼腆的瑞典小伙子，是个牧场主，教我如何用斯瓦希里语数数。斯瓦希里语中9的发音，在瑞典人听起来有些不清不楚的意思，他不愿意当我面念出来。当他数完“7，8”，他停下来，看向别处，说：“斯瓦希里语中没有9。”

“你是说，”我问，“他们最多只能数到8？”

“噢，不，”他飞快地说，“他们有10、11、12，等等。但他们没有9。”

“那行吗？”我诧异地问，“那19怎么办？”

“他们也没有19，”他说，脸刷地红了，但口气很坚决，“也没有90，也没有900，”——因为在斯瓦希里语中，这些词都以数字9为基础生发——“但除此以外，他们什么数字都有。”

很长一段时间里，我都对这种系统苦思不已，不知怎的，只觉得是妙趣无穷。我想，这个民族抱着天真的念头，勇于打破数字排列的单调无趣。

我心想，1、2和3，是唯一三个相连的素数(1)，也许8和10是唯一两个相连的合数：人们可能会试图证明9的存在，争论说：3×3总归是有的吧？但为什么应该有呢？如果数字2没有整数平方根，那数字3也许同样恰好没有平方。你可以设想任何一个数A，将它各位上的数字相加，直到最后成为个位数，你会发现，A里面有没有9或者9的倍数，对结果没有影响。由此可见，9这个数字也许真的可以说是不存在，我想，这就是我为斯瓦希里数字体系所做的辩护。

那段时间，我的一个仆人扎卡利亚意外失去了左手无名指。我心想，也许对原住民来说这事稀松平常。当他们扳手指加减的时候，还会更容易。

当我对其他人阐述我的观点时，我立刻被人打断，晓以真相。但我仍然感觉到：有一种原住民数字体系存在着，特征就是没有9，此体系对原住民来说完美无缺，会让你有很多新的发现。

此事让我联想起一位丹麦老牧师，他曾郑重其事向我宣布，他不相信是上帝创造了18世纪。

“我绝不容许你离开，直到你赐福于我”


四个月的干旱炎热后，非洲三月，雨季开始。万物欣欣向荣，满眼新绿及扑鼻芳香，以势不可挡之势覆盖每一片山野。

而农人们抑制住喜悦，不敢相信大自然的慷慨，他留神谛听，唯恐听见咆哮的雨势正在渐渐减弱。尽管经历了四个无雨之月，此刻大地饮饱的雨水将给农场带来生机，蔬菜、动物及人类的生存全仰仗这雨水。

看到农场上的道路全变成奔腾的河流，真是大快人心，农人在泥塘里深一脚浅一脚，心曲摇曳着，一路走向繁花盛放、枝丫湿淋淋的咖啡园。但有几次，明明是雨季中段，晚上星光却透过厚厚的云层照下来，仿佛即将放晴；那时，农人会在家门外眺首远望，仿佛想把自己吊在天空上，像挤牛奶一样挤下更多的雨水。他向上苍呼唤道：“给我足够的雨水吧，不，比足够还要多。我的心完全对你敞开，我绝不容许你离开，直到你赐福于我。淹死我吧，只要你愿意，但别用反复无常折磨死我。要做就做全套，别做完前戏就闪人，老天爷呀，老天爷！”

雨季之后的那个月，有时，一个冰冷苍白的日子，一下子把我们带回到“灾年”，那干渴欲死的大旱之年。灾年时，基库尤人仍在大宅周围放牛，一个放牛娃有支横笛，常常会拿出来吹一支小曲。每当我重新听到这支小曲，刹那间，过往所有的悲伤和绝望被唤醒。曲子里有泪水的咸，但同时，让我意想不到且感到震惊的是，我在其中发现了一种异样的甜美，一首歌。那些艰苦的时日，是否真的蕴藏了这一切？彼时我们正年轻，心中有不羁的渴盼，漫长的岁月将我们融为一体，即使在另一个星球上相遇，我们仍能认出彼此。无生命的器物也会互相呼唤，咕咕钟和我的书会向草地上瘦骨嶙峋的母牛和郁郁寡欢的基库尤老人发话：“你们也在这里。你们也是恩贡农场的一部分。”艰难岁月赐福于我们，然后扬长而去。

农场的朋友们来了又去。他们不是会在同一个地方待很久的那种人，更不是那种肯在那里安然老去的人；现在他们都去世了，再也不回来了。但他们曾经心满意足地坐在炉火旁，房子像怀抱，紧紧拥住他们，说道：“我绝不容许你们离开，直到你们赐福于我。”他们大笑着，赐福给我的家，然后一路远行。

一位在派对上闲坐的老妇人，说起自己的生平，宣称乐意重走一遍人生路。她觉得这心愿本身足以证明她生活得无怨无悔。我想：是呀，她的一生正是如此，必须活上两次，你才能说真正活过。一首短短的旋律可以不断重复，但完整乐章绝不能如此——交响曲也不能，五幕悲剧更不能。如果它真的重新来过，只因为在该叫停的时候没有叫。

我的生命，我绝不容许你离开，直到你赐福于我——然后，我会撒手，任你离开。





月食


有一年我们遇到了月食。月食发生前几天，我收了一封信，来自基库尤车站的年轻印度站长，内容如下：

尊贵的夫人：

承蒙盛情通知，太阳将连续七日不会现身。铁路火车的事，只能听天由命，唯有一事向您求教，因为我深信再无他人可以商量：这段日子，我是否还能由牛群在户外吃草，要么还是把它们关在圈里比较安全？

此致敬意，夫人。

你顺从的仆人

帕特尔





原住民与诗


原住民对节奏非常敏感，但对何谓诗一无所知，或者这么说吧，在我开办学校之前是这样的，因为学校教会了他们唱赞美诗。收割季节的一个晚上，玉米田里，大家正忙着掰玉米棒子，往牛车上扔。出于自娱自乐，我对一位非常年轻的雇工念了一首斯瓦希里语的打油诗。诗句本身毫无意义，纯粹为了凑韵脚：“牛儿吃盐吃得欢；娼妓全都是坏蛋；瓦卡姆巴人吃蛇贪。”这立刻引发了孩子们的兴趣，在我身边挤得密密麻麻。他们很快意识到诗在说什么并不重要，对诗中的主题也没有疑问，只是兴奋地等待着押韵，每出现一次，他们都欢声大笑。我试着先开个头，启发他们自己找出韵脚来，同力完成一首诗，但他们找不到，也可能是不想找，只是转开脸。当他们终于领悟诗是怎么回事儿，便央求我：“再来一个，来个像雨滴的。”(1)为什么他们觉得诗句像雨滴呢？我不知道。但不管怎样，这一定表示了一种喝彩，因为在非洲，雨水总是被衷心盼望和欢迎。

有关千禧年(1)


基督复临之事已经确定，复临之日亦已临近，一个委员会应运而生，负责安排对他的接待工作。经过数次讨论后，发出通告：禁止任何人挥舞抛掷橄榄枝，同时也禁止呼喊“和散那”(2)。

千禧年持续了若干时日，歌舞升平，普天同喜。一晚，基督对彼得(3)说，众生入梦后，他想同彼得两人出去散散步。

“您想去哪里呢，主啊？”彼得问。

“我想，”主回答道，“从总督府(4)出发，沿着长街，走到各各他(5)。”

基托希事件


基托希事件在报纸上登过。一场诉讼因此引发，陪审团对事件的前因后果都做了详尽的调查，试图厘清线索；一些旧文档中，还保留了当时的讨论。

基托希是一个年轻的基库尤人，为莫洛的一位年轻白人移民做事。六月的一个星期三，主人把一匹棕色母马借给朋友骑到火车站去。然后，主人派基托希去车站把母马带回来，叮嘱他不能骑马，只能牵着。但基托希跳上马背，骑回了家。星期六，一位目击者把他的过失告知了那位移民主人。作为惩罚，星期日下午，主人鞭笞了基托希，并把他绑在仓库里，星期日深夜，基托希死了。

八月一日，高等法院就此事在纳库鲁铁路协会开庭。

原住民纷纷赶来，在铁路协会外坐成一圈，却想不通这到底是在干什么。在他们看来，事情很简单，基托希已经死了，这一点毫无疑问，以他们的观点，应该因此赔偿一笔钱给他的遗属。

但欧洲人的正义观是与原住民迥异的，对白人陪审团来说，首先呈现的问题便是“有罪与否”。本案的裁决可能是故意杀人、过失杀人，或者重伤害致死。法官提醒陪审团：犯罪的性质取决于当事人故意与否，而非完全依赖于结果。那么，基托希案件中的当事人，主观态度是什么，他行为的本来意图又是什么？

为了确定那位白人移民的态度与意图，法庭对他做了连续几小时的交叉盘问。试图重现当时所发生的一切，盘问记录了所有细节以寻找着手点。以此路数，他们详细记下：主人召唤基托希，他来了，站在三米开外。这个微不足道的细节在报告里却充满了震撼效果：大幕拉开，惨剧即将上演，白人与黑人，隔着三米的距离。

但从此处起，故事一步步发展，画面的平衡被打破了，主人的身影渐次模糊，越来越渺小。这是没办法的事。在浩瀚的背景中，他嬗变成为配角，有苍白孱弱的脸孔，完全无足轻重，像用纸片剪出来的人儿，被气流吹得轻飘飘飞荡，他的所作所为好像都是因为这不知名的风在任意胡为。

主人陈述如下：起初，他问过基托希谁允许他骑棕马的，这个问题他反反复复问了四五十次；他承认，当时的情况下，不可能有什么人做主批准基托希这么做。他就此陷入了万劫不复的境地。在英国，他永无可能把一个问题问上四五十次，根本用不着四十遍，对方就要么打岔要么求饶把话头止住了。而在非洲，对方竟然无动于衷，任他把同一个问题喊了五十遍。最后，基托希答道：我不是贼。主人申辩道：这回答太傲慢，激怒了他，他才让人鞭打基托希。

写到这里，报告中出现了第二个离题万里但极具影响力的细节。报告中说明，在鞭打过程中，两个被认为是主人朋友的欧洲人来拜访他。他们在旁边看了十到十五分钟，走了。

鞭打过后，主人还不肯放过基托希。

夜深了，他用缰绳把基托希捆起来，锁在仓库里。陪审团问他为什么这么做，他回答说，没什么想法，就是不想让这种人在农场里到处乱窜。晚饭后，他回到库房，发现基托希躺在离被捆绑处稍远的地方，不省人事，身上的绳索已经松开了。他叫来自己的布干达厨师，在那人帮手下，把小伙子捆得比先头更紧，双手牢牢绑在身后的栏杆上，右腿绑在身前的栏杆上。他离开仓库，锁上门，半小时后又回来了，把厨师和厨房僮仆揪过来，也关在仓库里。然后他就上床去了，之后他能记得的第二件事就是：僮仆从仓库跑来，告诉他，基托希死了。

陪审团谨记指示，犯罪的性质取决于当事人故意与否，于是开始寻找他行为的意图。关于基托希受到的鞭笞，他们追问了很多细枝末节，以及之后的情形。当你读着记录，仿佛能看到他们在频频摇头。

可是，基托希的意图是什么，他的主观态度又是什么？关于这个，随着调查深入，发现结果耐人寻味。基托希确实有所意图，而此意图成为案件天平上最重的砝码。借由此意图，以及他的主观态度，这个非洲人从坟墓中拯救了这个欧洲人。

基托希没有太多机会表达意图。他被锁在仓库里，因此，他所传递的信息非常简单，只是一个单一的姿态。守夜人陈述说：基托希哭了一整晚。但不尽如此，因为凌晨一点左右，他与同他一道被关在仓库里的僮仆说过话。他示意这孩子跟他说话必须用吼，因为他的耳朵被打聋了。在凌晨一点，他让僮仆解开他的脚，解释说反正他也跑不了啦。僮仆照他说的做了，然后基托希说他想死。四点，僮仆说，他又重复了一遍说自己想死。过一会儿，他翻了一个身，喊道：“我死了！”死去了。

三位医生就本案向法庭提交了证词。

本地区的外科医生曾为死者做过尸检，断言死因是他在死者身体上发现的创口和严重损伤。他认为即使当场急救，也没有任何医疗手段能挽救基托希的生命。

但是，另两位当事人辩护律师从内罗毕请来的医生，却持不同观点。

他们认为，鞭打本身并不足以致死。事件上有一个重要因素不容忽视：那就是基托希起了死心。关于这一点，第一位医生表示，他可以凭职业权威说——因为他在本国已经生活二十五年，完全了解原住民的思维。许多医生也都能证明——原住民一旦起了求死之心，真的能够致死。在当前的案子中，事实十分清楚，因为基托希亲口说过他想死。第二位医生也支持他的观点。

医生继续说下去，很有可能，如果基托希不抱求死之心，他就不会死。比如，他如果吃些东西，就不会丧失勇气，因为饥饿会令人意志消沉。他又加了一句，说：基托希嘴唇上的伤未必是踢出来的，可能只是他在剧痛中自己咬的。

更进一步，这位医生认为基托希是在晚上九点之后才下定求死之心的，当时他似乎正准备逃走。客观上他在九点前也确实还活着。当逃亡的企图被发现，他重又被绑起来，医生认为，身为囚徒的事实，可能对他来说，沉重得难以承受。

两位来自内罗毕的医生最后就本案做了总结发言。他们认为：基托希的死，是鞭打、饥饿和求死之心的共同结果。最后这个因素特别值得强调。他们经过推敲认为：求死之心大概是由鞭打造成的。

在医生们的证词之后，案情急转弯，法庭讨论转为对所谓“求死之心理论”的大辩论。本地区外科医生是唯一曾经亲眼目睹过基托希的尸体的人，他反对这种理论，并举他诊所的癌症病人们为例：他们人人都想死，还不是个个求死不得。但是，随即发现这些病人全是欧洲人。

陪审团最后做出裁决如下：裁决有罪，罪名为重伤害。此裁决也包括那几位原住民从犯，但考虑到他们只是听命行事，而发号施令者为欧洲人，监禁他们有失公正。于是判处白人移民两年监禁，每位原住民从犯一天监禁。

当你通篇读完此案，似乎意识到一桩怪异而耻辱的事实：在非洲，欧洲人不应该有权力剥夺非洲人的生命。这片国度是他们土生土长的原乡，无论你为他们做过什么，当他们离开，就是因为他们是自由人，有自由离开的意志，就是因为他们不想待了。谁应该对一幢宅子里发生的一切负责？房子的主人，房子未来的继承人。

他的决绝与高贵给我留下了深刻的印象，基托希的身影，以及他强烈的求死之心，虽然已经岁月荏苒，时过境迁，在我心中依然鲜明，呈现出本质的美。荒莽世界的难以捉摸，以此形象定型：在紧急关头，意识到某一处可以匿身；他们说走就走；而对于他们，其实我们从来不曾真正掌握。





一些非洲鸟类


漫长雨季的开始，是三月的最后一星期，或者四月的第一个星期，我听见非洲树林里夜莺在吟唱。不是一首完整的歌谣，只是一些短句——协奏曲的开头几小节，一次彩排，戛然停止，又重新响起，就仿佛湿沉沉的林间与世隔绝，却有人坐在一棵树上调试一把小小大提琴的弦。然而，这同样的旋律，同样的丰盛与甜美，会在顷刻之间充盈全欧洲的森林，从意大利的西西里到丹麦的埃尔西诺。

非洲的鹳分黑白两色。这种爱在北欧小村庄茅草屋顶上筑巢的鸟，在非洲远不如在欧洲那么深受喜爱，因为它们总是被拿来与身型庞大沉重的非洲鹳和蛇鹭相提并论，当然相形见绌。鹳在非洲的生活习惯也与欧洲不同。在欧洲，它们总是成双成对，是美满家庭的象征，而在这里，总能看到一大群鹳聚在一起，犹如在参加鸟儿俱乐部。在非洲，它们也被称为“蝗虫鸟”，当蝗虫出现在高原上，它们就紧随其后飞来，蝗虫是它们的主要食物。人们在草原上放火烧荒时，它们也会飞来。跳动的小小火苗，组成火线，向前推进，它们高高盘旋在火场上空，空气微微颤动，在阳光下折射出霓虹七彩，透过灰色烟雾，它们寻找着逃出火场的蛇与鼠。鹳鸟们在非洲生活得很是惬意，但它们的真实生活不在此地，当春风撩起它们求偶与筑巢的念头，它们的心便转向北国，记起旧日时光和从前的老窝。它们双双对对，翩然飞去，没多久，就在出生地冰冷的泥泽里踢踢踏踏了。

原野辽阔，雨季开始了，被火燎过的草地上，碧绿的嫩芽无边无际地铺开，上百只鸟来到这里。草原总有一种海洋般的氛围，一望无际的地平线，让人想起大海和长长的海岸线，四处漂泊的风与海风一模一样，烧焦了的草有盐的清芬，新生的草长高后，在风中起起伏伏，一如海浪。当白色的康乃馨在旷野上盛放，你记起当你乘坐的船只在海湾里掉头时，浪花拍船，卷起千堆雪。草原上的鸟外形像海鸟，举动也跟沙滩上的海鸟一模一样，在密密草丛中，它们一会儿飞跑而过，一会儿又突然间高亢地长唳一声，就在你的马前直冲天幕，青空因为翅翼和鸟鸣声平添生机。

冠鹤早前刚刚造访过新开垦播种的玉米田，把玉米种子都刨出来吃了，但它们是吉祥鸟，能预告雨的到来，聊以抵销这抢劫活动；另外，它们也为我们翩翩起舞。这种高大矫健的鸟成群聚在一起，大片大片振翅飞舞，场面真是赏心悦目。它们舞姿风格独特而无造作，为什么明明能飞，飞起时却必然会落下，仿佛被地球磁场牢牢系住？优美如芭蕾，有一种神性的庄严，也仿佛是宗教仪式上的舞蹈；也许冠鹤打算连接天堂与大地，正如肋生双翼的天使沿雅各的天梯(1)上上下下。它们长着精致的浅灰羽衣、小小的黑紫帽状头、扇形的羽冠，仿佛是从壁画上走下来的，轻灵如仙魅。舞蹈一罢，它们腾空升起飞走了，身后依然留着圣洁的余韵，以翅翼的拍打，以清脆如一连串银铃的叫声，仿佛所有教堂的钟都长出了翅膀，倏忽隐去。你能听见它们的歌声从很远处传来，即使它们的身影已经消失在天空：云层后钟儿还在轻轻敲。

体型更大的犀鸟也是农庄的访客，来吃好望角金栗树的果实的。他们是非常罕见的鸟，碰到它们是桩奇遇或者美好经历，但并不总是让人心里舒坦，因为它们看去无所不知。一天早晨，日出之前，我被窗外大声的叽叽喳喳声吵醒，走到平台上，看到四十一只犀鸟坐在草地间的大树上。它们看去不像鸟，更像被孩子随手挂在树上的装饰物，这里一个，那里一个，充满魔幻气息。它们通体漆黑，那种优雅悦目的非洲黑，吸取了岁月积淀，如古老的炭，是最深的黑，这使你意识到，论典雅、魄力、生命力，没有一种颜色能与黑色媲美。所有的犀鸟都在用一种兴高采烈的调子互相交谈，态度又有节制，像葬礼之后继承人的大聚会。晨光清如水晶，这阴郁的聚会笼罩在一片欣欣向荣与纯粹洁净中，而且，就在树与鸟身后，朝阳升起来了，是个暗红的火球。你不免想知道，如此晨曦之后，你将度过怎样的一天。

在所有的非洲鸟类中，火烈鸟的色泽是最鲜明美丽的，或红或粉，像一枝开得正好的夹竹桃在空中飞翔。它们有令人难以置信的长腿，长颈与身体的曲线既奇异又似出自精雕细刻，仿佛为了刻意装扮出某种古典传统之美，它们平日里每一神态、一举一动，都尽可能做得无比繁难。

有一次，我乘一艘法国船从塞得港到马赛去，船上托运了一百五十只火烈鸟，要送往马赛儿童乐园。它们被关在脏兮兮的箱子里，四面用帆布围起，十只一箱，箱子一层层摞得很密。运养这批鸟儿的饲养员告诉我，这趟旅行，他已预估会有20％的损耗。它们生来就不是过这种日子的，恶劣天气里，有的会摔倒，折断腿，箱子里的其他鸟就踩在它们身上。地中海入夜后，海风汹涌，大浪重重地扑打着船身，每一次颠簸，在黑暗中，都能听到火烈鸟的尖叫声。每天早晨，都能看见饲养员拿出一两只死鸟，扔进大海。它们曾在尼罗河上高贵地涉水而过，也是荷花的姐妹，在山水间徜徉，瑰丽如迷途的晚霞，此刻却变成一堆松松垮垮的红色粉色羽毛，两条长腿像两根棍子似的伸出来。死鸟在海水里漂了一会儿，追在船后掀起的波浪里，起起落落，然后便沉了下去。

帕尼亚


苏格兰猎鹿犬与人类共同度过了数不清的岁月，获得了属于人的幽默感，还会发笑。它们对于开玩笑的想法和原住民一样，事情弄糟了，便觉得很滑稽。如果你不曾拥有艺术素养和圣公会的宗教情怀，或许也会深陷这一层面的幽默感，无法逾越。

帕尼亚是我的爱犬黄昏的儿子。一天，我和帕尼亚一道散步在池塘边的小路上，那里有一排高挑细直的蓝桉树，它从我身边向一棵树跑去，又中途折返，示意让我同去。我走到树下，看到一只山猫高高地坐在树杈上。山猫抓鸡，所以我向走在不远处的一个僮仆喊话，派他去大宅取枪，枪一到手，我随即射杀了山猫。它轰然倒下，重重地砸在地上，帕尼亚立刻扑了上去，抓着山猫又摇又扯，玩得很开心。

过了段日子，我又一次行经池塘，走的是同一条路；我本来是出门打松鸡的，却一无所获，帕尼亚和我都情绪消沉。只在刹那间，帕尼亚飞扑向远处的一棵树，无比激动地咆哮着，绕着树打转转，冲回来找我，又扑向树。很高兴枪就在我身上，我满心期待，以为是第二只山猫，因为山猫的斑点毛皮很美丽。我向树跑去。但是当我仰头上望，却发现是一只黑色的家猫，正拼命向上爬到最高处，无路可逃，在树顶上摇摇晃晃，对我们怒目以视。我放低枪口。“帕尼亚，”我说，“你这个傻瓜！这是一只猫。”

我转身看向帕尼亚，它站在稍远处，看着我，咧开嘴，笑容满面。当我们目光相遇，它扑向我，蹦蹦跳跳，尾巴猛摇，发出撒娇的呜呜声，两只前爪搭在我肩上，鼻子紧贴着我的脸。它随后跳回原处，为了能够无拘无束地大笑。

这一连串动作是它在说：“我知道。我知道。这是一只温顺的猫。我从头到尾都知道。说真的你得原谅我。可是你得想想你刚刚的样子，拿了把枪冲向只家猫！哈哈。”

一整天，它都保持着同样的亢奋，不时重复刚刚的举动，向我表达它至高至热忱的友爱，再收回几步，为了能无遮无掩笑个够。

它的亲密里掺杂了几分讨好。“你是知道的，”它在说，“这个家里，我只给过你和法拉笑脸。”

夜已深，它在炉火前安睡，还能听见睡梦中它喉咙吱吱嘎嘎、偶尔小声窃笑的呜噜。我相信这件事它记了很久很久，每当我们经过池塘和那片树丛，都会想起来。





埃萨之死


一战期间，埃萨被迫离开我家，停战之后又回来，一直安静地住在农场上。他妻子名叫玛丽亚莫，是一个瘦弱、黧黑、吃苦耐劳的女人，每天搬柴到大宅是她的工作。在我先后雇过的仆人里面，埃萨是脾气最好的一个，从来没跟人起过争执。

而在那流离的一年里，一定有什么事发生在埃萨身上，他回来的时候变了。有时候我担心他会无声无息地死在我面前，就像一棵被连根砍下的树一样。

埃萨是我的厨师，却不喜欢烹饪，他想当园丁。这世上的一切，能让他真心实意乐在其中的，就只有花草树木了。但当时我已经有一位园丁，却没有厨师，于是我又让埃萨回到厨房里。我答应过他，有机会就让他做园丁，但月复一月，事情始终在搁浅。令我惊讶的是，埃萨在河边筑起堤坝，为自己圈了一小块地，在上面栽种植物。不过这活儿是他独个儿完成的，他不是大力士，堤坝修得不够结实，雨季一来就全冲跑了。

埃萨安静得近乎虚无的日子被第一次打破，是从他弟弟在基库尤人保留区去世，留给他一头黑母牛开始的。从那时起，各种线索渐渐显露，证明埃萨如何被生命榨干，经不起任何强烈的风吹草动。我得说，特别是无法承受幸福。他向我请了三天假把牛带回来。他到家后，我看到他一副“小人乍富，不知所措”的坐立不安，就像在严寒中冻僵的人，突然被带到温暖的室内，冻麻的手脚不知道该怎么动弹了。

所有原住民都有赌徒心理，从黑母牛开始，埃萨不由想入非非，觉得从现在开始，幸运之神在对他微笑。他对万事都树立了无穷信心，也有了远大梦想。他觉得将来还有盼头，于是决定娶一个新妻子。当他告诉我他的打算时，其实已经在与未来岳父谈判了，那老头住在内罗毕公路附近，娶了一个斯瓦希里老婆。我试图说服他。“你已经有一个非常好的妻子了，”我说，“你的头发已经花白，你用不着再来一个。就老老实实待着，安安稳稳过日子吧。”对我的规劝，埃萨没有动气，这个矮小和气的基库尤人直直站在我面前，以不置可否的方式坚持他的决定。不久之后，他把新妻子法托玛带到了农场上。

如果埃萨曾对新婚姻抱有憧憬之情，恰好显示他已经丧失了判断力。新娘非常年轻粗鲁，整天闷闷不乐，她穿着母族的斯瓦希里服饰，也继承了母族的放荡不堪。在她身上绝无一丝少女应有的欢快与温文。然而埃萨满脸放光，因为志得意满，也因为踌躇满志；他的每一举动全是僵硬的，仿佛已经患上全身麻痹症，在爆发边缘游走，自己却一无所知。玛丽亚莫是他顺从的奴隶，始终隐身事外，仿佛根本漠不关心。

可能埃萨也曾兴高采烈得意非凡过，但时间一定很短暂，好梦不长，他宁静的农场生活就被新妻子打得粉碎。婚后一个月，她从他身边逃走，到内罗毕军营里和原住民兵丁们厮混去了。之后很长一段时间，埃萨经常告假一天去城里带她回家，天黑了才拖着满心不愿的黑皮肤女孩进门。起初他上路的时候，是信心十足、下定决心的，他一定要她——怎么着？她不是他名正言顺的妻子吗？再后来他的出发，则完全是一种糊里糊涂的行为，惆怅地追寻着逝去的梦和好运曾经的笑靥。

“你要她回来干吗呢，埃萨？”我对他说，“让她去吧。她不想跟你回来，强扭的瓜不甜。”

让她去？埃萨想都没想过，直到他短暂生命的终点。这件事很简单：他是花了钱才娶到她的，她就是那笔钱，他得留着这笔钱或者这个人。每当他步履艰难地上路寻妻，其他仆人都在嘲笑他，还告诉我，兵丁们也在奚落他。其他人想什么，埃萨不理会，或者怎么说，他在乎过，现在不在乎了。他只是固执己见，一心一意要找回他损失的财产，就像人们搜索走失的母牛一样。

一天早晨，法托玛告诉我家里的仆人：埃萨病了，今天不能做饭，但明天会起床。但黄昏时，僮仆们跑进来告诉我，法托玛不见了，埃萨中毒快死了。我出门一看，他们已经把他连床抬出来，放在仆人房之间的平地上。一眼就能看出来，他活不长了。下的是一种本土毒药，与马钱子碱类似。在他的小棚屋里，那位犯下杀夫大罪的年轻妻子，一定眼睁睁看着他受尽痛苦折磨，确定自己已经干净利索地了结他之后，才溜之大吉。埃萨一阵阵痉挛，身体痛苦地紧缩着，除此外僵直冰冷，跟死人无异了。他的脸大变样了，带血的白沫从他发青的嘴角流了出来。法拉开车去了内罗毕，所以我无法送埃萨去医院，但我也不觉得有此必要，因为明显已回天乏术。

临死前，埃萨对着我盯了很久，我却不知道他是否还认识我。他黝黑的、动物般驯良的眼眸里，意识渐渐浮现，是关于家园的追忆吧，正如我一直想知道的那样，那时，这里就像挪亚方舟，还是个瘦小男孩的埃萨在草原上放牧着家里的羊群，附近都是野兽在出没。我握住他的手，那是一双人的手，一双非常灵巧的手，拿过枪，种植过蔬菜与花朵，爱抚过女人；我还教过这双手做煎蛋卷。埃萨如何总结他的一生，视之为成功还是失败？难说。他走过短暂、平缓而曲折的人生路，经历过那么多事，总是一个好脾气的人。

法拉到家后，不惮辛苦为埃萨安排了正统伊斯兰葬礼，因为他一直是虔诚的穆斯林。从内罗毕请来的阿訇第二天晚上才能来，所以葬礼安排在夜间，银河高挂在天上，与葬礼的灯火交相辉映。依穆斯林规矩，墓地选在森林里一棵大树下，墓前垒起一堵墙。玛丽亚莫现身在丧家行列里，站在未亡人的位置上，在夜色里，她为埃萨放声痛哭。

该如何处置法托玛，我与法拉商量过，决定由她去吧。很明显，对一个女人采取措施，绳之以法，法拉是反对的。我从他那里得知，穆斯林法庭不把女人当完全行为能力人，她的丈夫要为她的所作所为负责，她造成的麻烦由他赔偿，就好像马踹坏了东西要由主人赔偿一样。假设这匹马踢死了主人呢？是呀，法拉点头附和我，那真是不幸，命该如此。毕竟，法托玛也有理由抱怨自己的命运，现在她终于摆脱束缚，可以在内罗毕军营里随心所欲了。





有关原住民与历史


有人(1)期望原住民能一蹴而就，从石器时代直入机动车时代，完全忘记了我们白人的父辈历经怎样的千辛万苦和艰难，才带领我们一步步穿过历史走到了今天。

我们制造汽车和飞机，也能教会原住民开车开飞机，但对现代机械发自真心的挚爱却不是凭一己之力、朝夕之间就能培养的。需要几百年的时间才能让它慢慢长成，在这过程中，诸如苏格拉底、十字军东征(2)、法国大革命，都是不可或缺的。我们活在当下，酷爱机器，简直难以想象过去的人们没有机器如何生活。但我们创造不出《亚大纳西信经》、弥撒仪式，抑或五幕悲剧，也许甚至连十四行诗也拟不出。如果它们尚未万事俱备、随时可用，我们也会在没有它们的情况下生活。可以想象到，既然它们被创造出来，那一定是在某一个时期，人们心中迫切渴盼，而当时那强烈的愿望在它们诞生之时已经淡淡逝去。

法国神父大胡子伯纳德有一天骑着摩托车到农场上来，满脸欢欣若狂与凯旋的骄傲。他与我共进午餐，与我分享这喜悦的狂潮。他告诉我，就在前一天，九位年轻的基库尤人离开苏格兰长老会传教团，登了他的门，请求允许他们皈依罗马天主教，因为他们经过深思熟虑、反复讨论，认定天主教圣餐变体论(3)的教义是正确的。

所有的人，但凡我告诉他们这件事，都嘲笑伯纳德神父，说这几个基库尤年轻人无非是看到在法国传教团有更高薪水的机会、更轻松的活路，要么弄辆自行车骑骑，因此顺水推舟编出一套胡话，假装认同圣餐变体论。他们说，连我们自己都理解不了圣餐变体，甚至想都没想过它到底是怎么一回事儿，对于基库尤人，它当然更加是空中楼阁。但不见得如此；伯纳德神父很了解基库尤人。年轻基库尤人的思绪或许正沿着我们祖先徜徉过的林荫道一路前行，祖先们的丰功伟绩我们不能否认，对他们来说，圣餐变体论就是活生生的、近在咫尺的事物。这些五百年前的人甘愿舍弃高官厚禄、远大前程、一生的安逸享乐，有时甚至是生命本身，都不能舍弃圣餐变体论。他们不曾被许以自行车，而在有一辆摩托车的伯纳德神父本人眼中，宝马香车轻如鸿毛，九个基库尤人的皈依才重如泰山。

非洲的当代白人相信进化论，而不是任何突然的顿悟。也许他们能通过短期历史实践课，就让原住民大踏步追上我们。我们统治原住民的时间还不足四十年；假设我们把当下与公元零年相提并论，容许这两个时代并驾齐驱，原住民的三年相当于我们曾经的一百年，那么现在就是圣方济各脱颖而出的年代，再过数年就该轮到拉伯雷。原住民对他们的顶礼膜拜和欣赏有加会甚于当年的我们。几年前，我曾经试着把《云》(4)里面农夫的父子对话翻译给原住民听，他们对他赞不绝口。二十年内，非洲本土的大百科全书就会跃跃欲试；下一个十年，则会问世。我们应该容许他们有梦想家、哲学家和诗人，这样，福特先生(5)就会有赖以生存发展的土壤。

彼时，他们将在哪里遇见我们？是否那时，他们拍马疾驰，我们只能附骥在后，紧抓着他们的马尾才能不掉队；是否那时，我们的追求则是一些阴影，些许黑暗，我们正在反复练习印度手鼓？他们能不能用成本价接收我们的汽车，正如他们现在接收圣餐变体论一样？

地震


有一年圣诞节前后，地震了；震度不小，大概就像一头愤怒的大象使出了全身力气，很多原住民的棚屋都被震倒；一共震了三次，每一次只持续几秒钟，而在每次地震之间，还有几秒钟间隙。这短暂空白正好给了人们时间，让他们思索到底发生了什么事。

丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿当时正在马赛人居留区过夜，在卡车里露宿，事后告诉我，当他被震醒的时候，他想：“一头犀牛钻进了车底。”地震来的时候，我正在卧室里打算上床。第一次摇晃，我想：“一头花豹跳到了房顶上。”第二次震动来了，我想：“我要死了，原来濒死体验是这样的。”而在第二震与第三震之前有短短的沉静，我意识到这是什么了：这是地震，我从没想过能亲身体验。有一会儿工夫我以为地震已经结束了。而当第三震也就是最后一震突然来袭，巨大的喜悦席卷了我，回首平生，从不曾有一次像此刻一样，体会到这般突如其来、让人忘乎所以的极乐。

各自运行的庞大天体以神奇的力量把人类的心神引向不知名的极乐境界。通常我们意识不到它们的存在；只有当我们突然记起天文地理的存在，目睹它的巨大威力，视野才会蓦地开阔。多年工作之后，开普勒最后发现了行星运行的轨迹，他写下了当时的心情：

“我的全身心都欣喜若狂。一切已成定局。之前我从不曾感受过这样的欢悦。我在颤抖，我在热血沸腾。上帝等待了六千年，只为了等一个他伟大杰作的旁观者。他的智慧无边无际，而他包容我们的无知，正如包容我们那微不足道的一点点‘知’。”

事实上，地震发生时，就是同一种欢喜紧紧扣住我的心，令我摒弃所有。

巨大喜悦的首要原因，就是你意识到：有些事物你以为是安忍不动，其实想动就动。很可能这是世上最震撼的欢喜与希望。这个泥土星球，这堆死泥，地球本身，就在我脚下站起身，伸了下懒腰。它向我传递了一个信息，这最轻微的触及，却有无穷意蕴。它哈哈大笑，以至于原住民的棚屋垮了，它喊道：“但它还在动。”(1)

第二天大早晨，朱玛端茶给我，说道：“英国国王死了。”

我问他怎么知道的。

“难道你，姆萨比，”他说，“没感觉到地面跳来跳去、摇摇晃晃吗？那就说明英国国王死了。”

乔治


在去往非洲的货船上，有一次，我与一个叫乔治的小男孩交上了朋友，他是跟母亲和小姨一道出门旅行的。一天，在甲板上，他从家人们身边跑开，在长辈们眼光的监督下，走到我身边，宣布说：明天是他生日，他6岁了，他的母亲邀请英国乘客们来参加茶会为他庆生。我会来吗？他问。

“但我不是英国人，乔治。”我说。

“那你是什么？”他问，惊讶得不得了。

“我是霍屯督人(1)。”我说。

他站得笔直，沉痛地望向我。

“没关系，”他说，“我希望你来。”

他走回母亲和小姨身边，向她们宣布——口气若无其事，却态度强硬，直接拒绝任何异议：“她是霍屯督人，但我要她来。”

小汤匙


我有过一头膘肥体壮的骑乘骡，名叫莫莉。马夫却给了它另一个名字，叫它“凯吉柯”，就是“小汤匙”。我问为什么叫它汤匙呢，他答：“因为它长得像汤匙。”我绕着骡子转了几圈，想知道他到底怎么想的，我觉得，从哪个角度看，它都没有一分一毫像汤匙。

过了一段时间，我凑巧要驾车出去，把小汤匙与另三头骡子一起拴在两轮车上。我爬上高高的驾驶座，以一种鸟的视角，居高临下俯瞰骡子们。然后我明白了，车夫是对的。小汤匙背部格外细窄，却有一个又宽又沉的大屁股，看起来不折不扣就是一个倒扣着的汤匙。

如果车夫卡莫和我一人为小汤匙画一张速写，估计两幅画上的形象会判若两马。但上帝和天使看待它的角度与卡莫一致。“从天上来的是在万有之上，他将所见所闻的见证出来。”(1)

长颈鹿去汉堡


在蒙巴萨的时候，我总是住在希克·阿里·宾·萨利姆家里，他是负责海岸事务的长官，是一个好客、有骑士风范的阿拉伯老绅士。

蒙巴萨的景致像稚童笔下的天堂。环绕在岛屿周围深深的海湾，成为绝佳的港口；岛屿是微微泛白的珊瑚礁构成的，种满了高大翠绿的芒果树，猴面包树灰秃秃的，树杈千奇百怪。蒙巴萨的海明蓝如一朵矢车菊，而在港湾的入口处，印度洋卷起长排碎浪，画出一条纤细曲折的银白线条，即使最风平浪静的日子，也能听见低低的海之轰响。街道细窄的蒙巴萨城完全是用珊瑚礁建成的，色泽明丽：柔黄、玫瑰红、深褚……城市高处，立着雄伟的旧时要塞：壁垒森严，带着射击孔。三百年前，就在这一带，葡萄牙人与阿拉伯人展开激战；要塞比城市本身更具鲜明风情，仿佛因为时光荏苒，它身在高处，不止一次领受过日落时分的暴风雨。

蒙巴萨的花园里，嫣红的金合欢花正在盛放，热烈如火，在精致绿叶的映衬下，更显得艳丽不可方物。炽烈的太阳烧灼着蒙巴萨，几乎把它烤焦了；空气饱含盐分，每天，东来的轻风带进新鲜的海洋气息，土壤也是盐化的，所以少有青草生长，地面光净无垠，一如舞池。古老的芒果树枝繁叶茂，深绿色的树冠垂下密密浓阴，在树荫下盖出一片片圆圆的、清凉幽暗的结界，给人们提供了一个聚会处，此地是交际的中心地带，正如村落里，大家都围在井旁谈东说西一样。这是其他任何地方的树木都望尘莫及的。大型集市都在芒果树下举行，树干旁的地面上，围了一圈鸡笼，堆满了西瓜。

阿里·宾·萨利姆在岛上有一座舒适的白色宅邸，就在海岸线的拐弯处，门口有长长一列石阶，逶迤而下，直通大海。两侧是客人房，当中是掩在长廊后的主体建筑，大屋子里面陈列着各式各样精美的阿拉伯及英国收藏品：古旧的象牙及黄铜制品、拉穆古镇的瓷器、天鹅绒制成的扶手椅、照片和一部大型留声机。林林总总间，有一个内衬缎子的小盒，里面装着考究的英式茶具，是上世纪40年代的出品，一套中残余的几件。当年，桑给巴尔苏丹之子与波斯公主喜结良缘时，这是年轻的英国女王(1)和王夫送给他们的大婚礼物，希望新婚夫妻能像女王伉俪一样幸福美满。

“他们幸福吗？”我问希克·阿里·宾·萨利姆。当时，他正一只一只取出玲珑的茶杯，搁在桌上给我看。

“啊哈，不，”他说，“新娘不肯放弃骑马。她把爱马和其他嫁妆一道用帆船漂洋过海送过来，带在自己身边。但桑给巴尔人见不得女人骑马。为这事闹得惊天动地的，公主说丈夫可抛马不能弃，最后，婚事一拍两散，伊朗王的女儿回到了波斯。”

蒙巴萨的港湾里，停着一艘锈迹斑斑的德国货轮，返航在即。我经常坐在阿里·宾·萨利姆的划艇上，由他的斯瓦希里桨手们划着船，载我去往小岛再回来，往返途中都经过这艘货轮。甲板上立着一个高高的木箱，木箱上方露出两只长颈鹿的头。法拉也曾经到划艇上来过，告诉我，它们来自葡属东非(2)，即将被送往汉堡做巡回展览。

长颈鹿转动着线条优美的头颈，左边看看，右边看看，仿佛十分惊奇：将会发生什么呢？之前它们从不曾见过大海。在狭小的箱笼里，它们只有立足之地。世界陡地收紧变形，紧紧地锁闭在它们身边。

将是怎样颠沛流离的未来，它们不知道也无从想象。因为它们向来是高傲无邪的生灵，在大草原上娴静地漫着步；它们对囚禁、严寒、恶臭、烟尘和兽疥癣一无所知，当然更无从领悟绝对无所事事的世界里无聊之极的感觉。

一群群穿着深色衣服的人，身上都有味儿，将穿过寒风凛冽、夹霜带雪的街道，前来观看这两只长颈鹿，在不会说话的动物面前，体会身为万物之灵的优越感。他们会指指点点那纤细的长颈，哈哈大笑，而长颈鹿的头，秀美、柔顺，带着一双似烟似雾的大眼睛，高高地从动物展览车的栏杆上探出来；在这儿它们显得实在太高。孩子们被它们的样子吓哭，还有些孩子会爱得要死，喂面包给它们吃。于是爸爸妈妈们会认为长颈鹿真是可爱的动物，相信它们会陪孩子度过一段快乐时光。

在那些横亘于它们面前的漫长时间里，长颈鹿会否偶然梦见失去的乡土？它们此刻身在何处，将去往哪里，草原和金合欢树，河流和隐隐青山，还能重温吗？草原上淡薄清新的空气扬起又落下。其他的长颈鹿在哪里？它们曾经肩并肩，在起伏的草原上小步跑过。伙伴们抛舍了它们，全都不见了，而且好像永远不会再回来。

入夜了，圆月在何方？

在展览会的大篷车里，在狭窄的箱笼里，长颈鹿醒了，颤抖着，满鼻都是烂草和啤酒的混合臭气。

再见，再见，我希望你们可以在旅途中死去，两只都是。否则，你们小小而高贵的头颅，现在高高探出箱外，满是惊奇神情，映衬在蒙巴萨的碧蓝天幕上，就会在汉堡，左边看看，右边看看，但全然孤独无依，在那里，无人知道非洲。

至于我们自己，直到有人给我们以最粗暴的伤害，我们才会恍然大悟，郑重请求长颈鹿的原谅，为我们所给予它们的最粗暴的伤害。

在动物展览会里


大约一百年前，丹麦的西麦尔曼伯爵旅行到汉堡，正好当地在举行一场小型的巡回动物展览，他立刻被迷住了。在汉堡期间，他每天都会绕道经过那里，虽然他自己也说不清，这又脏又破、像随时会坍下来的篷车，究竟哪一点吸引了他。真相是：巡展与他内心某些事物互相呼应。正是冬天，室外严寒刺骨，在展览棚里，饲养员点起一只旧火炉，褐黑色的炉膛渐渐透出淡淡的粉红。炉子放在兽笼旁边，但阴风寒气还是直砭人们的骨髓。

西麦尔曼伯爵站在鬣狗笼前专注凝视着，巡展会的老板过来跟他打招呼。老板是个瘦小苍白的男人，塌鼻梁，曾经是神学院的学生，闹出丑闻后离开了学校，自此便开始一步步在社会上走下坡路。

“伯爵阁下，好好看看这只鬣狗。”他说，“把鬣狗弄到汉堡来可真是件了不起的事。在这之前，本地从来没有过鬣狗呢。所有的鬣狗，您得知道，都是雌雄同体。在非洲——就是它们来的地方——月圆之夜鬣狗们都会头尾相联成一个环，又当雌的又当雄的，彼此相媾。这事儿您知道吧？”

“不。”西麦尔曼伯爵说，因为嫌恶，轻轻动了一下身子。

“那您现在想想看，伯爵阁下，”老板说，“考虑到这一点，对鬣狗来说，被独个儿关在笼子里，是不是会比别的动物更难受？它会感到双重的性欲，还是，因为它是两性一体的，能够自体互补，于是完全自给自足，自得其乐了？换句话说，既然我们都是生命的囚徒，是越有才能越幸福呢，还是越不幸？”

“真是不可思议，”西麦尔曼伯爵说，犹自沉浸在自己的思绪里，不曾留意到老板的话，“有成百只乃至上千只鬣狗活过来死过去，只为了最终我们能在这里有一个活生生的标本，让汉堡人民知道鬣狗的长相，自然学家也可以对它们做一番研究。”

他们走向隔壁笼子，参观里面的长颈鹿。

“野生动物们，”伯爵说下去，“在大自然里生活的那些，其实不能算真实存在过。这一只，在这一会儿，是存在的，我们给它取了名字，还知道它什么样子。其他那些也许根本就不存在，虽然它们才是绝大部分。大自然真奇妙呀。”

老板把头上的旧皮帽摘了下来，皮帽下的头顶光秃秃的，一根头发也没有。“长颈鹿们是彼此认识的。”他说。

“即使这样也是说不定的。”西麦尔曼伯爵停了停，“比方说，这些长颈鹿，皮肤上有正方形斑块。长颈鹿们见面的时候，不知道什么是正方形，所以见到也认不出。那怎么能说它们能互相认识呢？”

老板对长颈鹿凝视片刻，然后说道：“上帝认识它们。”

西麦尔曼伯爵微微一笑。“认识长颈鹿？”他问。

“啊，是呀，阁下，”老板说，“上帝认识长颈鹿。它们在非洲跑来跑去，玩得正欢的时候，上帝一直看着它们，它们做什么，他都看得津津有味。他创造它们就是为了让自己开心的。这是《圣经》上说的，阁下。”老板说，“上帝真爱长颈鹿，所以创造它们。上帝发明了正方形，也发明了圆形，肯定阁下不会否认这个，他在它们的皮肤上看到正方形，还有其他的一切。野生动物，阁下，也许就是上帝存在的证据。不过当它们到了汉堡，”他总结道，戴上帽子，“就变得说不准了。”

向来随大流的西麦尔曼伯爵沉默了一会儿，走向火炉旁的蛇笼参观。老板讨好地打开了放蛇的箱子，还试图把里面的蛇弄醒；最后，那只睡意蒙的爬虫缓缓地沿着他的手臂盘旋而上。西麦尔曼伯爵注视着这一人一蛇。

“说真的，我的好坎尼基特，”他阴沉地笑了一声，“如果你是我的手下，或者如果我是国王你是首相，你估计现在就得滚蛋了。”

老板紧张地看着他。“是的，大人，您说的是我？”他说，任蛇滑回箱里。“那为什么呢，大人？我斗胆请问。”过了一会儿他加上一句。

“啊，坎尼基特，你绝不像你表现出来那么简单，”伯爵说，“为什么？因为，我的朋友，对蛇的厌恶是人内在的直觉，凭这本能，人类才能苟活于世。蛇是人们不共戴天的死敌，而这个，除了我们辨别善恶的本能，还有什么能告诉我们？狮子的利爪、大象的体积和分量、水牛的角，我们都能一目了解，马上警惕。但蛇是美丽的动物。圆圆的，很光滑，像那种我们会在生活中珍爱的物品，色泽更是美轮美奂，一举一动都细腻迷人。只有对神敬虔的人，才会觉得它漂亮优雅的外表令人作呕，从它身上嗅到地狱的气息，提醒自己它令人堕落。他内心有什么东西让他躲避蛇，就像躲避恶魔，这种东西就是俗称的‘良心的声音’。能抚摸蛇的人，还有什么干不出来。”西麦尔曼伯爵对自己的宏图大论很得意，淡淡一笑，扣上华丽皮大衣的纽扣，转身要离开展览棚。

老板在沉思中伫立片刻。“阁下，”他最终说，“您必须要爱蛇。别无选择。以我自己的经验来看，我可以这么说，老实说这也是我能给您最好的忠告：您必须要爱蛇。记住这话，大人，通常——记住这话，大人——不，是几乎每一次，我们向上帝要一条鱼，他给的都是一条蛇。”





旅伴


在去非洲的船上，会客室的桌前，我坐在一位比利时人和英国人之间，比利时人去刚果，而英国人为了捕猎一种特殊的山区野羊已经去过十一次墨西哥，这次是去射紫羚羊的。为了同两边的人说话，我多种语言混用，当我打算问比利时人他是否经常旅游，便用法语问：“您以前的阅历多吗？”他并不觉得我冒昧，只是取出嘴里的牙签，庄重地答道：“数不胜数，夫人。”从这一刻起，他的谈话主题就是告诉我他一生中的丰功伟绩。他说到每一件事，总用这样一句口头禅来收场：“我们的使命，我们在刚果的重大使命。”

一天晚上，我们正打算玩牌，英国旅客跟我聊起墨西哥，忆起一位花甲之年的西班牙贵妇，住在山间一个与世隔绝的庄园里，当她听说有陌生人到访，便请他过来，让他把外面的新闻讲给自己听。“嗯，现在人能飞了，夫人。”他说。

“是的，我听说过了，”她答道，“为此我与我的的神父吵了好多架。先生，现在请赐教。当人们飞起来的时候，他们的腿是像麻雀一样，在身子下面蜷着呢，还是像鹳一样，伸得直直的？”

在我们的对话中，他特意强调了一番墨西哥原住民的无知，也提到了当地的学校。比利时人当时正在发牌，最后一张牌还握在手里，突然停下来，严厉地瞪着英国人，说道：“得教给黑鬼们什么叫诚实，什么叫勤奋。别的都不必。”啪的一声，他把牌摔在桌上，赌咒发誓般地重复道：“别的都不必。不必。不必。不必。”





博物学家与猴子


一个研究自然史的瑞典教授来到农场上，托我帮他同野生动物部交涉一下。他告诉我，他到非洲来，是想查明在胚胎期的哪个阶段，猴子的脚分化出大脚趾，开始与人类的脚有所区别。为此，他计划在埃尔贡山捕猎几只疣猴。

“从疣猴身上您会一无所获的。”我对他说，“它们生活在雪松树顶上，生性羞怯，难以捕猎。想取到您需求的胚胎，绝对得洪福齐天才行。”

但教授满怀希望，打算一直待在非洲，直到拿到胚胎脚，他说，哪怕要经年累月也在所不惜。他已经向野生动物部提交了狩猎疣猴的申请。此行动完全出于至高无上的科学研究，所以他满心认为当然会获批准，但直到现在始终没有答复。

“你申请捕猎多少只猴子呢？”我问他。

他说，考虑到刚开始，所以只申请了捕猎一千五百只猴子。

当时我在野生动物部有熟人，我也乐于帮忙，就寄了一封信过去，请求给个答复，并附上“请即回示”的回邮信封，因为教授急不可耐，想马上开始研究工作。答复立刻就随着下一班邮件到了。信上写道：野生动物部很高兴地通知兰格林教授，考虑到他的狩猎是为了科学研究，野生动物部破例将他许可证上的四只疣猴提升到六只。

我不得不把这封信向教授念了两遍，他才终于接受现实。他显得那么沮丧、无比震惊，满腔热忱遭受重创，一个字都说不出来。对我的安慰劝解，他毫无反应，只是走出屋外，坐上车，伤心地开车走了。

当事情没发展到这一步，希望还没完全落空时，教授其实是个喜欢说说笑笑的好聊天对象，很有幽默感。当谈起猴子时，他教了我许多方面的知识，也向我陈述了不少观点，令我大开眼界。有一天，他说：“我得告诉您一桩发生在我身上的趣事。当我爬上埃尔岗山，有一瞬间，我几乎可以承认上帝的存在，这事您怎么想？”

我说真有意思呀，但心里想：另一个问题也同样有趣——在埃尔岗山上，是否有一个瞬间，上帝几乎可以承认兰格林教授的存在？





卡罗门亚


农场上有个9岁的小男孩，名叫卡罗门亚，又聋又哑。他能发出“啊啊”的叫声，一种短促沙哑的嘶吼，但他很少叫，而且也不喜欢自己这样，总是叫着叫着，突然停住，呼哧呼哧地喘气。其他孩子怕他，抱怨说他打他们。我认识卡罗门亚时，是小伙伴们用树枝打他的头，把他右脸都打肿了，碎渣陷在面颊里，伤口溃烂发炎，必须用针把碎渣一块块挑出来。这对卡罗门亚，并不像一般人那么觉得苦不堪言：没错，他受伤了，但至少他也因此与人群有了接触吧？

卡罗门亚非常黑，有一双水灵灵的黑眼睛和浓密的长睫毛。他表情严肃认真，几乎从来没见他笑过，完全像一只当地产的非洲小黑牛犊。他天性活跃，是个好动的小家伙，既然用言语与世界沟通之路被切断，打架就是他表达自我的绝佳方式。在扔石头方面，他是一把好手，想扔到哪里就能扔到哪里，准头好得不得了。有一段时间卡罗门亚有一套弓箭，但他始终没学好，对弓响的灵敏听力似乎也是好弓箭手技艺的一部分，是必需的。相对他的岁数来说，卡罗门亚体格强健，力气很大。如果有机会让他拿自己身体的优势交换其他孩子的听说能力，他多半是不肯的。我觉得，对他们的能言善道，他并没什么特别的歆羡。

卡罗门亚虽然性格好斗，却不是一个难以相处的人。一旦他意识到你在跟他打招呼，他的脸会马上放光，虽然不带一丝笑纹，却迅速呈现出一副欢天喜地的样子。卡罗门亚喜欢小偷小摸，一有机会就信手牵羊，拿走糖或者烟，然后把自己的胜利果实与其他孩子们分享。有一次，我遇到他正在向一圈男孩子分发糖果，他在圆圈的中心，没有看到我。那是唯一一次，我看到他脸上露出了与笑容很接近的表情。

有一段日子，我试图为卡罗门亚在厨房或者大宅安排个活计，但他什么都做不好，而且没做多久就烦了。他最喜欢干的活，是把重东西搬来搬去，或者把它们从一处拖到另一处。大宅车道上排了一列刷白的石头，有一天，我让他帮忙把其中一块滚到房前，这样车道上的石头就对称了。第二天我不在家，卡罗门亚一块一块把所有的石头都滚到了房前，积了很大一堆，我简直不敢相信：以他的身量，居然能有这本事。他一定是耗尽了全力。看上去好像卡罗门亚很明白世界对他的定位，而他愿意不负众望。他又聋又哑，但他身强力壮。

在这世上所有的东西里，卡罗门亚最想要的，是一把小刀。但我不敢给他，他这样巴心巴肝地想与人打交道，我怕他一时情急之下，用刀伤人，甚至砍死一两个农场上的孩子，这对他恐怕真是举手之劳。不过，待他长大，他总归会得到小刀的；他的渴望如此热烈，上帝才知道他拿小刀来做什么。

我最让卡罗门亚感动的，是我给了他一枚口哨。那是我有时候自己吹来唤狗用的。我刚拿给他看时，他显得没什么兴趣；随后，在我的指导下，他把口哨放在嘴唇上吹响，大大小小的狗从不同方向飞奔而来，争先恐后地扑向他，他几乎给吓倒了，脸惊得发青。他又试了一次，发现效果一模一样，于是抬眼看我，目光炯炯如炬。他把口哨试了又试，想知道到底是怎么个机理。他细细观察口哨内部，没发现机关，但只要他一吹口哨，狗儿们就会蜂拥而来，他皱紧眉头，一一打量着，想知道它们是被什么吸引过来的。这次之后，卡罗门亚对狗儿们爱得不行，这么说吧，他经常借狗儿们带出去散步。每次他浩浩荡荡领着它们准备出发，我多半都会用手指向西方天空的某一点，表示太阳到那里时，必须带狗回来；他也会指向同一点，表示理解，而且总是准时完璧归赵。

一天，我骑马出门，看到卡罗门亚和狗儿们在离我家很远的马赛人居留区。他没看见我，以为附近完完全全只有他自己，不在任何人的视线内。他让狗儿们四散奔跑，然后吹响口哨召唤它们，反反复复了三四次，这一切，骑在马上的我，尽收眼底。在农场之外，在他觉得无人知晓的地方，他沉浸在陌生的创意里，给自己树立了一个全新的人生形象。

他一向用绳把口哨系在脖子上，但有一天，口哨不在脖子上。我打着手势问他：怎么了？他以手势示意：不见了——丢了。他从不曾向我要过另一个口哨。也许他以为那枚口哨是独一无二的，也许他是想，从现在起与那些不真正属于他的事物离得远远的。我不敢肯定是不是他自己扔掉了口哨，因为它与他的真实生活那么格格不入。

他渐渐长大了，之后五六年间，卡亚门罗要么历经各种艰难险阻，要么会因意外猝死，倒也好，会顷刻升上天堂。





普莱·辛格


普莱·辛格小小的铁器作坊坐落在咖啡加工厂旁，在农场上，那就是地狱的缩影，符合所有地狱的惯常特征。作坊是用波纹钢搭成的，当阳光直直地射在房顶上，炉膛里的火苗也正腾得老高，屋里屋外的空气一片滚烫。从早到晚，作坊里响彻锻铁炉震耳欲聋的锤打声——铁器一下下相撞，咚，咚咚——小屋里堆满了斧子以及破损的车轮，让这里看上去有几分古代刑场般的阴森意味。

与此同时，铁器作坊又是这样富有吸引力，每当我过去看普莱·辛格工作，总有人在里面，或者簇拥在附近。普莱·辛格工作起来有超人的速度，仿佛生死存亡全取决于是否能在五分钟内完成手边这一桩活计，他在锻炉前一跃而起，厉声对两个基库尤助手发号施令，嗓音鸟叫一般高亢尖锐，他那上蹿下跳的劲儿，就像有火烧他的脚板心，或者是个正在大发雷霆的恶魔。但普莱·辛格不是恶魔，相反，有着顶驯良的心地；工作以外的时间，他都羞怯得像个没出门子的大闺女。他是我们农场上的“方迪”——意指全方位的能工巧匠，除了打铁之外，他还是木工、马具工、家具工；他甚至还以一人之力，为农场设计制作了好几辆大车。但他最爱的工作就是打铁。他往轮轴上装轮胎的场面，真让人高兴，同时为他自豪。

普莱·辛格的外表多少有些欺骗性。当他全副装扮，穿上大衣，缠上大幅打褶的白头巾，又配着他的黑色大胡子，看去像个臃肿笨重的人。但当他站在锻炉旁，赤着上身，只穿着印度式灯笼裤，才发现他瘦小敏捷得惊人。

我喜欢普莱·辛格的锻炉，基库尤人也喜欢，主要是基于两个原因。

首先，因为铁本身，在所有原料里，铁是最变化多端的，可以随人处理，任人的想象自由驰骋到很远的地方。犁、刀剑、大炮和车轮——这就是人类文明——人类对大自然的征服，以这般简单的方式，被原始人类理解或者猜测——而普莱·辛格锻打铁。

其次，原住民世界被铁的碰撞声，那钢铁之歌，吸到了锻炉前。锻打声组成尖锐、活力焕发、单调又惊人的旋律，有一种神奇的力量。它是如此富有男性气概，令女人的小心肝怦怦跳，不由自主地融化；它直接，明确，不掺杂感情成分，句句都是实话，除了实话之外不带半句虚言。如果真是个男人，那他有时直言不讳得够可以，有无穷的精力，永不言倦的强壮与阳光快乐，够体贴，只要你需要，他为你做重活粗活跟玩儿似的。凡是喜欢节奏的原住民，都聚在普莱·辛格的小屋旁，觉得在那里最放松。根据古代挪威法律：人们不必对在铁器作坊里的言论负责。今时非洲的铁器作坊里，大家的舌根也一样松，纷纷侃侃而谈；各种奇谈怪论，伴着铁锤的锻打声，被说出来，又被传得无边无际。

普莱·辛格跟随我很多年，在农场上也算高薪阶层。但他的开销与收入是不成比例的，他过着最严谨的苦行僧生活：不吃肉，不喝酒，不抽烟，不赌博，旧衣服总穿到要扔为止。他把钱全寄回印度去供他的孩子们读书。他有个安静的小儿子，德利普·辛格，曾经从孟买来看望父亲。那孩子从来没摸过铁，我看他周身上下唯一的金属，是上衣口袋里的蘸水钢笔。父亲神奇的动手能力没有传给第二代。

至于普莱·辛格本人，在锻铁炉前大发异彩，他在农场期间，始终因此而光芒熠熠，我希望这光芒他能保持一辈子。他是诸神的仆人，是元素精灵(1)，被千锤百炼过，灼热白炽。在普莱·辛格的铁器作坊里，铁锤唱出的是你的心事，仿佛它只为你一个人的心而唱。对我而言，铁锤唱的是一首古老的希腊诗篇，一位朋友曾经翻译过：

爱神(2)嗖的一箭，如铁匠挥舞他的锤，

火星四射，是我的凛然拒绝；

爱神令我的心在眼泪与悲伤中冷却，

如烧得通红的铁，被投入冰凉的河流。

(1) 元素精灵：中世纪炼金术著作中提出的概念，将世界分为四种元素与其主掌精灵。通行版本为土水风火四种，普莱·辛格显然是火精灵。

(2) 爱神：美神维纳斯之子，身带弓箭，分别有金箭和铅箭两种，中金箭者则会爱，中铅箭者则会拒绝爱。





奇遇


那年，我在马赛人居留地为政府做运输工作时，有一天看到了一个奇异的景象，诸如此类的场面，我从没听熟人说遇见过。那是一个中午，我们正在草原上艰苦跋涉着。

空气对非洲景致的作用，远比在欧洲来得重要。气流里充满隐隐约约的幻影和虚像，某种程度上是真实舞台，上演着种种活动。正午的酷热令空气也颤抖振动，如小提琴的琴弦，它悬浮在一望无垠、夹杂着金合欢树和小山包的广阔草原上，在枯干的野草上幻化出银光烁烁的广袤水域。

空气是流动的火焰，我们穿行其中。那天我一改往日的习惯，走在大车前很远的地方，身边有法拉、我的狗黄昏和照看狗的僮仆。天太热了，让人懒怠言语，我们谁都不说话。突然间，地平线附近的草原仿佛有什么东西在行动飞驰，不仅仅是空气本身，是一大群野兽正从右方浮现，浩浩荡荡向我们而来，呈斜角线穿越我们面前的舞台。

我对法拉说：“看那些牛羚。”但过了一会儿，我开始怀疑，那真是牛羚吗。我举起望远镜眺望它们，然而正午阳光刺目，很难看清。“它们是牛羚吗，法拉，你觉得呢？”我问他。

我发现，黄昏已经高度警觉，全副心神聚焦在来犯者身上，双耳竖起，擅长远视的双眼紧盯着对方的一举一动。通常在草原上，我都由它自由追逐羚羊和其他食草动物，但今天我觉得太热，早早吩咐僮仆用皮带拴上它的项圈。就在这时，黄昏短促而凶狠地咆哮了一声，向前猛扑，僮仆一下子被它拖倒在地，我赶紧抢过皮带，尽全力拽住它。我看着远处的野物们。“它们到底是什么？”我问法拉。

在原野上判断距离与大小是很困难的。空气的颤抖、远近景象的雷同，都造成阻挠；同样，那些四散的金合欢树，它们看去都有原始森林里参天大树的伟岸，事实上不过三米高，只到长颈鹿肩头的位置，长颈鹿的头颈会高高地从树顶上露出来。要目测远方猎物的尺寸，你的眼睛经常欺骗你，尤其是在正午，会把豺看成野牛，把鸵鸟当作犀牛。沉默少顷后，法拉答：“姆萨比，是野狗。”

野狗通常三五成群，也有十几只聚在一起的。原住民很怕野狗，会告诉你，它们十分嗜血凶残。有一次我在农场附近的居留区骑马，有四只野狗一直尾随我身后，离我只有十五米。两只我带在身边的小狗吓得不行，紧紧贴着我的马，几乎是躲在马肚子下面，直到过河回到农场，才松了口气。野狗体形比鬣狗小一些，大概跟德国牧羊犬差不多大，全身漆黑，只在尾尖和耳尖上各有一撮白毛。它们肤质不好，粗糙不平，毛孔粗大，还有臭臭的气味。

眼前大概有五百只野狗，以一种奇异的姿态，慢慢跑着，既不左顾也不右盼，仿佛被什么巨大的恐惧摄住，抑或他们早有明确的目的地，现在是沿着既定路线在急行军。当它们靠近，只是稍稍拐了个小弯儿绕开我们，仿佛根本没看到什么，仍然保持着不紧不慢的步伐。越来越近，只在五十米外了。它们两三只或三四只一横排，纵向十分漫长，花了很长时间，这支纵队缓缓地从我们面前经过。法拉说：“这些野狗都累坏了，看来它们走了很长的路。”

它们终于一只一只走远了，从视野里消失，我们才转头张望运输车队，车队还在我们身后不远处。高度紧张带来的巨大疲乏，使我们在草原上席地坐下来，直到车队靠近。黄昏极度焦躁，猛拉皮带，想去追赶野狗。我抚着它的脖颈安慰它，想，如果当时我没有拴好它，它现在已经变成野狗的点心了。

车夫甩下车队，向我们跑来，问我们：刚刚这里怎么了。我没法向他们抑或我自己解释：是什么让野狗数目如此庞大，还是那么一副鬼样子。原住民们全视此为噩运的兆头——预示着战争，因为野狗是吃腐肉的。远征中的大小事他们都爱谈论不休，只有这件，他们绝口不提。

我曾经把这事说给很多人听，没有一个人相信。不过此事千真万确，我的仆人们可以为我做见证。





鹦鹉


一位丹麦老船长闲坐无事，思量起年少轻狂的日子，那年他只有16岁，在新加坡一家妓院里度过一夜春宵。他是与父亲船上的水手们一起去的，一位中国老妇人应酬他，与他聊天。当听说他来自遥远国度，她便拿出一只老鹦鹉，它是她的宠物。她告诉他，很久很久以前，她有过一个出身高贵的英国情人，这只鹦鹉就是情人送的。少年想这只鸟岂不得有一百岁。这里客人们都来自五湖四海，鹦鹉会说世界各地的多种语言。其中有一句话，是英国情人教会鹦鹉的，在它跟随老妇人之前就会说，老妇人始终不懂得意思，也没有一个客人能告诉她。多年过去，她已经不再打听。但既然少年是远道而来，也许恰好是他的母语，能翻译给她听呢。

她的提议让少年莫名地深深惊怖。他看着鹦鹉，一想到没准会从那丑陋的鸟喙里听到丹麦语，差点儿从窑子里跑了出去。他留下来，只为了帮中国老妇人一个忙。幸好当她让鹦鹉开口的时候，他发现原来是古希腊语。鸟儿很慢很慢地念出来，少年古希腊语不错，听明白了，那是一首萨福(1)的诗：

月西沉，昴星隐，

夜已央；

时间飞逝，飞逝，

而我，独眠。



当他逐行翻译，老妇人拍拍嘴唇，细长的吊梢杏眼转来转去。她请他再念一遍，然后点点头。

别了，农场


“神和人啊，我们都会被这样欺骗！”





艰难时世


我的农场地势太高，并不适宜种咖啡。寒冷月份里，较低处的咖啡树嫩枝会经历霜冻，新结的咖啡果冻成了赤褐色，纷纷从枝头掉落。风从荒原上呼啸而来，即使是风调雨顺的年景，我们的咖啡亩产也从来比不上地势较低的锡卡和奇安布，它们海拔约一千两百米。

还有，恩贡山区缺少雨水。我遇到过三个大旱年份，农场因之遭受重大打击。有一年，降雨量为一千三百毫米，我们收成了八十吨咖啡，另一年为一千二百毫米降雨，收成近九十吨；但在两个荒年里，一年是六百毫米降雨，收成十六吨；另一年是五百毫米降雨，收成十五吨。这些年份，对农场来说，近乎遭受灭顶之灾。

与此同时，咖啡价格一路下跌：从前一吨能卖一百镑，现在只能卖到六十到七十镑。农场的日子越来越难过。我们还不起贷款，也没钱经营种植园。我故乡的家人朋友也在农场有股份，写信给我说：农场非卖不可了。




为了挽救农场，我挖空心思。有一年我在荒地上试种亚麻。种麻本身很有意思，但它要求种植者是经验丰富、技巧娴熟的行家。有一位比利时难民做我的参谋，问我打算种多少顷，我答说：一百二十公顷。他立刻叫了起来：“呀，夫人，这是不可能的。”他解释道，我能顺利栽种两公顷，顶多四公顷，再多就没戏了。然而四公顷对我们来说是杯水车薪，我最后种了六十公顷。开花时分的亚麻田真是美不胜收，满眼天蓝——宛如一小片天堂落在人间。没有什么织物能比亚麻制品更舒适宜人：挺括平滑，触感微微滑腻。亚麻打包送走后，你的心也随之远行，想象着它被制成床单和睡衣。但缺乏系统持续的指导，无法在短期内教会基库尤人收麻、沤麻和打麻；我的种麻事业以失败告终。

那些年，当地的农场主们都曾做过类似的尝试，其中只有几位能迎来光明未来。恩乔罗的英格丽德·林斯东，就是最终柳暗花明的一位：我离开肯尼亚的时候，她已在农场里摸爬滚打十二年，种菜、养猪、饲火鸡、育蓖麻、培植大豆……眼睁睁看着它们纷纷落败，为它们心酸落泪。山穷水尽之际，靠种植送往伦敦制造杀虫剂的除虫菊，她东山再起，为家人与自己保住了农场。我就没这好运气了，大旱年份，狂风自阿西河平原上刮来，咖啡树萎靡不振，枝叶枯黄凋零；有些田地的咖啡树遭了严重虫灾，被蓟马和椿象吃得不成样子。

为了种好咖啡，我们试着施肥。我时常这么干，因我满脑子都是欧洲那套农业技术，不施肥却向土地予取予夺的非洲作风总归让我别扭。农场棚民们听说了我的计划后，也都积极前来襄助，从他们的牛棚和羊圈里，送来陈年积粪。这些粪肥质地细腻，一如泥煤，易于处理。我们从内罗毕买来只用一头牛拉的新式小犁，在一排排咖啡树之间犁出犁沟。田里不能走两轮牛车，农场上的妇女们便用麻袋背着粪肥，一把一把撒在沟里，每一棵树正好散掉一袋粪肥。之后，我们再牵牛犁掉头，把土覆盖上去。看大伙儿干得这么热火朝天，真让人兴致高昂，我满心指望着一分耕耘十分收获，但客观事实是：看不出施肥前后有何异同。

真正的困难还是资金的匮乏，投资早在我接手经营农场前就已耗尽。所以任何大刀阔斧的举措，我们都负担不起，相反只能挣多少吃什么勉强糊口——最后那几年，这种苟延残喘的方式，就是农场的日常模式。

我想，如果我有足够的资金，我会放弃咖啡，砍倒所有咖啡树，改而在我的土地上种植森林原木。在非洲，树木成长迅速，十年内便可以舒适地在蓝桉树和金合欢树下的荫凉里漫步。而之前，你只是在细雨绵绵的季节，把小树苗十二棵一箱装在箱子里，从苗圃里移植到该地。我禁不住浮想联翩，木料和柴火在内罗毕都能卖个好价钱。而且植树是桩高尚事业，多年后回想起来，也能老怀大慰。从前农场上有大片原始森林，但我接管前就已经砍伐一空卖给了印度人；真可惜。日子拮据起来，为了购置蒸汽机的经费，我也砍伐过农场上厂房外的树林，那些树木高大伟岸，绿荫浓密，我经常在那里小坐休息。我对人对事向来不曾有亏，但砍倒那些树，是我平生愧事。之后隔三岔五，每当手头有点儿余钱，我就会种一小片桉树，但始终没有铺成大片树林。以这种方式，要把几百公顷土地都种上树，将农场变成松鸣萧萧、科学管理的森林，还要在河畔兴建伐木厂，需要五十年时间。农场上的棚民们时间观与白人相去甚远，我才种下小树，他们就已满怀憧憬地瞻望着未来：柴火满山，人人取之不尽——正如那些昔日的好时光。

我也计划在农场上养牛，经营牛奶场。我们位于疫区，此地有东海岸热(1)蔓延，要饲养优质牛，必须对它们浸浴消毒。由于疾病的威胁，要与较高海拔非疫区的专业奶场竞争是相当困难的，但我与内罗毕如此之近，所以可以天刚亮就开车送奶进城。有一段时间，我们养了一群奶牛，并在草地上修筑了精良的奶牛浸浴消毒池。但我们终于还是把奶牛出手了，消毒池里长满野草，屹立有如一座底朝天的空中楼阁，被毁得面目全非。后来，每每在傍晚的挤奶时分，我走到玛吉或者卡尼努家的牛栏附近，嗅到母牛的甜美气息，渴望拥有自家牛棚和奶牛场的痴念又在心中冲撞。当我骑马经过草原，星罗棋布的野花在我脑海里幻变成了奶牛身上的斑点。

时日更替，这些计划都渐行渐远，终成画饼。而如果能卖掉咖啡，保住农场，放弃它们所有我也甘愿。

维持农场是沉重的负担。我农场上的原住民们，甚至我的白人雇工们，让我承担他们的命运，为之操劳担心。有时候我觉得，连农场上的牛和咖啡树，都会这么做。会说话的生灵与不会说话的生命，在此达成一致，雨季来得太晚，夜晚如此寒冷，都是我的错。晚上想坐下来看会儿书简直是大逆不道的行为，失去农场的恐惧摄住我，我坐不定，只能开车出去。法拉知道我心烦意乱，但并不赞成我晚上出去散心。他告诉我，日落时分，有人看到花豹在我家附近出没；他时常久久站在走廊上，等我回家，伸手不见五指的夜，只看到他一袭白袍的身影。但我太难过了，没心思考虑什么豹子，我知道晚上在农场公路上打转转于事无补，却还是要去，就像一只没有方向、四处飘荡的孤魂野鬼，不知道要去哪里，也不知道为什么要去。

离开非洲两年前，我去欧洲探亲。我是在咖啡采摘季节回到非洲的，到达蒙巴萨以前，关于收获的消息完全无从得知。在船上那段时间，我脑海里反复思量这个问题。当我心态舒畅，事事都顺心的时候，我估计咖啡产量能有七十五吨；但当我情绪不佳或者紧张焦虑的时候，我就想：不管怎么样，也只能有六十吨吧。

法拉在蒙巴萨迎接我，我不敢立刻问他咖啡收成的事；好一会儿，我们谈的都是农场上的闲篇儿。到晚上，我打算上床了，终于拖无可拖，我问他：他们总共在农场上收获了多少吨咖啡。索马里人在宣告不幸时总是兴高采烈，但法拉没有幸灾乐祸，事实上极其沉痛，他直直地立在门边上，半垂下眼帘，头向后仰起，仿佛咽下满腹悲伤，他开了口：“四十吨，姆萨比。”刹那间，我明白农场保不住了。我身边一切都黯然失色，所有生命都悄然枯萎，蒙巴萨的酒店房间、水泥地面、古旧的铁床、破烂的蚊帐，此刻呈现出强大寓意：它们就是世界的象征，如此黯淡窒闷，不会因为人生活在其中就有所粉饰，或者稍微装点门面。我对法拉什么话也没说，他也没再开口，只是走开了，是世界上最后一个友善的身影。

人的意识中有自我疗愈的强大本能，夜已过半，我想起了老努森，四十吨也是收成呀，而绝望——才是致命的恶习。再说无论怎样，我都要回家了，能再次翻身上马，棚民都在这里，朋友们会来做客。十小时之后，我就会乘上向西南疾驰的火车，会看见恩贡以蓝天为幕的青色剪影。




那一年，蝗虫过境。据说它们来自埃塞俄比亚。当地两年大旱之后，它们向南而来，沿途片草不留。蝗虫未至，种种骇人听闻的消息已在乡间肆虐，都在说那些遭受它们浩劫的地方——一路向北，玉米、小麦、果园，它们所过之处，全变成沙漠。农场主们派跑腿人去通知自家南边的邻居：蝗虫来了。但即使有预警，你也无能为力。每户农场上，人们都高高堆起柴火和玉米秸秆，准备蝗虫一来立刻点火，所有的雇工都被派了出去，手上拿着空铁皮罐头，叮嘱他们要一边大喊大叫，一边猛敲罐头，希望能吓得蝗虫不敢落地。但这些都只是聊胜于无，不管农人们怎么吓唬，蝗虫们不会永远盘旋不下，每位农人唯一的希望就是：把它们赶到南边那家农场去。而它们被驱逐得越远，最后落地时，就越饥不择食，越不顾一切。我家南边就是马赛人居留地的浩荡平原，因此我只希望蝗虫能一路不停脚地飞，送它们过河到马赛人那边就行了。

有三四位跑腿人，从邻近的农场来向我报信：蝗虫已经来了。但是，静悄悄的，什么也没有发生，我开始相信那只是虚惊一场。一天下午我骑马去附近的零售店，是法拉的弟弟阿卜杜拉开的为农场的雇工和棚民提供各种商品的农家小店。它位于较高路段，一辆骡车停在店外，骡车上的印度人起身向我致意，既然他不能开车去我的平原，所以等我经过时，他才开口。

“蝗虫来了，夫人，请您赶紧回去吧。”当我靠近他身边，他说。

“我听这话好多遍了，”我说，“至今还没见着呢。也许没有人们说的那么糟。”

“请转个身，夫人。”印度人说。

我转过身去，看到就在北方的地平线上，天空降下一片黑压压的阴影，像一道长长的浓烟，像一座镇子起火了。“像一座百万居民的大城市在晴天里排放烟雾。”我想，抑或一抹窄窄的乌云正在升腾。

“那是什么？”我问。

“蝗虫。”印度人答。

归程中，我看到一些零零星星的蝗虫，加起来可能有个二十只吧。我经过经理的房子，吩咐他做好驱赶蝗虫的全部准备。我们一起向北看，蓝天上的黑烟变高了一点儿。就在我们观察的时候，蝗虫一只接一只，从我们头顶上飞过去，或者落在地面上向前爬。

第二天早上，我打开门向外看去，一片荒凉肃杀，赤地千里。树、草坪、车道，极目所见，全被染成了红褐色，仿佛一夜之间，一场厚厚的陶土雪覆盖大地。是蝗虫们在那儿。我正站在那儿观望，眼前的一幕忽然震动破碎，蝗虫们活动起来，飞高了，片刻间，空中全是鼓翅之声，它们飞远了。

那一天蝗虫对农场为害不算太大，它们只待了一个晚上。我们都看到了蝗虫的样子：二十五毫米长，十二毫米宽，褐灰带粉，摸起来黏糊糊的。它们光落在我车道边的几棵大树上，就把它们压垮了。你看看那些树的惨状，记起每只蝗虫不过几克重，就可以想象蝗虫的数量。

蝗虫们去而复来；两三个月间，它们持续袭击农场。我们很快放弃了想吓跑它们的痴心妄想，恐吓蝗虫纯粹是一桩既无望又悲喜交加的行动。有时，小群蝗虫飞来，是脱离大部队的散兵游勇，来去匆匆。但大部分时候，蝗虫们成群结队，铺天盖地，好几天时间才飞离农场，从早到晚，在空中不断俯冲向前。最高潮期，像故乡的暴风雪，带着凄厉啸声的狂风大作，你身前背后，头上脚下，全是小而坚硬的翅狂暴地扇动着，在阳光里闪烁如同精钢的薄薄刀刃，遮蔽了太阳，暗了天地。从地面到树顶，蝗虫组成一条宽带，宽带之外仍是晴空。它们嗖嗖地扑你的脸，钻你的领口、袖管和鞋里。蝗群围绕着你，令你头晕目眩，一种特殊的、掺杂着作呕的愤怒与绝望，对蝗群的巨大恐惧，充斥你身心。蝗虫数不胜数；消灭其中多少只，都显得微不足道。当蝗虫终于飞去，消失在地平线上，宛如一道长长的孤烟，你脸上手上，在蝗虫曾经爬过的地方，还残留着嫌恶感，会伴随你很久很久。

而在蝗虫大军身后，是庞大的鸟群，在它们头顶盘旋，一旦蝗虫落地，就也跟着飞抵地面，在田地间走来走去，吃得脑满肠肥，活得很是滋润——鹳与鹤，这些得意忘形的坐享其成者。

蝗虫在农场驻扰不去的日子里，对咖啡园倒不算大祸患，因为咖啡叶像月桂叶一样坚硬，它们嚼不动，只是零零星星毁了一些树干枝叶。

玉米田可就惨不忍睹了，当蝗虫把它们洗劫一空再扬长而去后，田里什么都不剩了，只有几片枯叶孤零零挂在折断的玉米秸秆上。我的菜园位于河边，曾被细心灌溉，永保鲜绿，此刻像一片垃圾堆——花、蔬菜、香草，全荡然无存。棚民们的自留地被席卷一空，几成焦土，这些小爬虫们，连土都给翻了个底朝天。废墟间，蝗虫尸体随处可见，仿佛是这片土地残余的唯一果实。棚民们木然站着，看向它们。在自留地上每天辛苦耕耘、挖来种去的老妇人们，伤心得半疯半癫，对天空中那渐远渐淡、慢慢消失的黑影直挥拳头。

到处都是被大军抛下的蝗虫尸体。在它们栖身过的大路上，大小车辆经过，碾死了不少。现在，蝗灾过后，轮辙上仍布满密密麻麻的蝗尸，铁轨般长长的，望不到尽头。

蝗虫在土里下了卵。翌年春天，雨季过后，小小的褐色幼虫开始活动——蝗虫生命的第一阶段，还不会飞，只能四处爬动，所到之处，吃光一切。




我手里没钱了，也没东西能够变卖出钱来，只能卖掉农场(2)。一家内罗毕的大公司买下了它。他们认为此处地势太高，不利于咖啡种植，也不准备经营农业。于是计划砍伐所有的咖啡树，把土地分区，铺设道路，等内罗毕向西发展时，再待价而沽，把地皮卖给建筑开发商。具体要到年底开工。

即便到了这种田地，我仍然觉得，自始至终，我内心从没想过要为任何事放弃农场。即将成熟的咖啡果高挂在枝头，仍属于农场的目前主人，或者对农场持有优先抵押权(3)的银行。直到五月，这些咖啡才会被采摘，在工厂加工后运走。这期间我还是留在农场上，管理经营，事事按部就班，看去一切照旧。这段日子，我希冀着，有什么事也许会发生，扭转乾坤，让事态回到老路上去。因为归根结底，大千世界难言规律，凡事均不可以常理而论。

就这样，我的农场生涯进入了一个奇特的纪元。真相是万事万物的基础，真相就是：农场不再属于我。即使如此，所有还未能认识到这一点的人均对此抱着视而不见的态度，日复一日，什么也不曾改变。时时刻刻，我在学习“活在当下”的艺术，要么也可以称为“活在永恒里”。当下的瞬息万变，对永恒来说，全然微不足道。

最不可思议的是：自头至尾，我本人从没真正相信过我将失去农场或者离开非洲。身边人人都说这是我的必然选择，他们全是通晓事理的人；每一封家乡来信都向我力证这一点，我日常生活中的点点滴滴也都这样指出。它们仍然全被排斥在思绪之外，我仍然笃信，我将埋骨于非洲。此信念，一无事实基础，二无情理可言，只是当时的我，已经没有余力思考任何纷繁复杂的世事了。

那几个月里，我在脑海里建立了一个规划，一个战略方案，意图对抗宿命，对抗我周围所有宿命的同盟者。我盘算着，从此以后，小事上我要处处让步，以避免不必要的麻烦。我要听任我的敌手们每日陷在这些事务里，谈论不休，打笔仗，爱怎么处理就怎么处理吧。最终我将东山再起，保住我的农场以及农场上的人们。我意识到，失去他们，我做不到：想都不敢想，怎么可能呢？

就这样胡思乱想着，我成为最后一个意识到我必须离开的人。当我回顾在非洲的最后时光，仿佛在我知觉之前很久，所有无生命的事物：山峦、森林、平原和河流、呼啸的风，全都知晓我与它们终将别离。从我开始向命运妥协，就农场出售事宜进行谈判，一草一木对我的态度就起了变化。在那之前，我是它们的一部分，大地遇旱是我血管里的一场高烧，草原花开是我的一袭新裙。此刻田野从我身边撤步而去，站在一箭开外，我终于能清清楚楚看到它的全貌。

雨季临近的时候，山川会做同样的事。一个夜里，当你远眺群山，仿佛突然间地动山摇，它们突然对你无遮无掩，形象鲜明，色彩生动，一切栩栩如生，仿佛它们意欲对你袒露胸怀，奉上它们所拥有的一切，仿佛你会从椅子里起身，走上那绿茵茵的山坡。你不禁想到：若一只羚羊此刻跳将出来，当它左顾右盼，当它动动耳朵，我会盯着它的眼睛；如果一只小鸟在灌木的枝梢驻足，我会听见它的清歌。三月山间，这纵情的姿态意味着雨季将至。但此刻，对我而言，这意味着分离。

之前，我也曾见过其他地方，在你即将离开时，以同样的情怀把自己全盘给你，但我已经忘了那况味。我只是想：我从不曾见过山野如此动人，只是远望一眼，已足以令你喜乐终生。光与影分割着风景；彩虹高挂在天际。

当我与白人们在一起时：律师、内罗毕的生意人，或者为我的未来人生出谋划策的朋友们，总有一种难以言喻的隔膜感，有时几乎像生理感觉——一种窒息。在他们中间，我觉得我是一个理智明白的人；但有那么一两次，我会陡然反应过来：如果我疯了，处身在清醒的正常人中间，感觉大概也不过如此。

农场上的原住民本质上都是极端务实的，对现状和我的千思万缕知道得一清二楚，就像我亲口对他们讲过，或者为他们白纸黑字写在书里一样。一如往日，他们指望我帮助他们，照管他们，却完全没考虑过亲力亲为安置后路，哪怕一件小事也没有。为了让我留下来，他们也尽力了，煞费苦心想出很多千奇百怪的点子，并且一一告诉了我。当农场已经售出，每天从早到晚，他们都会来我的房子，在屋外坐成一圈，并不是有话要跟我说，只是要陪伴我的一举一动。这是领导者与追随者之间自相矛盾的时刻：他们如此清晰地看到他身上所有的脆弱与落败，能不偏不倚、恰如其分地给他下断语，却仍然势不可挡地仰赖他，仿佛除了围绕在他身边，他们确确实实别无活路。一群绵羊对牧羊少年的情态庶几相似，它们比他更了解山川地貌和风云变幻，却依然跟在他身后，如有必要，径直踏入深渊它们也在所不惜。基库尤人对当前形势了解得比我透彻，这来源于他们对上帝与魔鬼的深刻内在洞察，但他们只是坐在我屋外，静等我的指示；很可能，他们一直都在口无遮拦地数落我的幼稚和举世罕见的无能。

你可能会想：他们现在经常待在我家附近，我也早知我爱莫能助，他们的未来沉沉地压在我心上，压力会大到难以承受吧。但不是这样的。我相信，直到最后一刻，我们对彼此的陪伴都感受到了一种奇异的安抚和解脱。我们之间的默契深过理智。那段日子，我时常想起拿破仑兵败莫斯科(4)的场面。人们通常都以为，当他看到身边尸横遍野，他的百万雄兵在受苦受难，一定痛心疾首，但也有可能，要不是有他们，出师未捷身先死的就是他本人了。静夜难眠，我数着时间，一分一秒过去，还有多久，基库尤人又会出现在我家门外？

吉南朱伊之死


就是那一年，吉南朱伊大酋长去世了。一天深夜，他的一个儿子到我家请我与他同返他的村落，说父亲快咽气了：“那塔卡库法”——他起了死心——原住民如是说。

吉南朱伊已经垂垂老矣。不久前，他生活中发生了一件大事：马赛人居留区暂停牲畜隔离制度。这位基库尤老酋长一闻其信，立刻率领亲朋，直奔居留区的最南端，结束与马赛人繁杂的账目往来，把自己的牛群带回家，还要捎上牛群在外生的小牛犊。就在这里，他身受重伤。据我所理解的，是大腿被一头母牛撞伤了，肆后伤口生了坏疽，直接导致了这位基库尤酋长的死亡。直到最后他才起意返乡，那时他已在马赛人居留区待了太长时间，病入膏肓，经不起长途旅行了。很可能是他一心一意要带上所有牲口，非得一头都不留下，不然不肯动身；也可能是他有一个女儿嫁在当地，可以照顾他，直到他渐渐心里不痛快，觉得女儿不是那么真心诚意伺候自己到痊愈的。总之，他出发了。可想而知，为了送他回家，他的护从们竭尽全力，排除万难，用担架扛着这位奄奄一息的老人赶了好远的路。现在他躺在自家的棚屋里，命在旦夕，派人找我来。

吉南朱伊的儿子到我家是晚饭后的事，法拉与我驱车前往村寨时，天已经黑了，月亮出来了，一轮上弦月高高挂在天上。路上，法拉把话头扯到谁将继吉南朱伊之后成为基库尤人大酋长的问题上。老酋长子嗣无数，很明显，将有各种因素影响基库尤世界的运作。法拉告诉我，其中两个儿子是基督徒，但一个属罗马天主教，另一个皈依的是苏格兰长老会，为了让自家的冒牌太子登龙位，两家传教团都会不遗余力。而基库尤人自己，似乎却希望是这二位之外的儿子当选，更年轻、不信教的儿子。

最后一两千米路和草地上牛踩出来的畜道没什么分别。草带着露色，灰蒙蒙的。快到村子了，车趟过一条蜿蜒的细细河流，河中波光荡漾；忽然起了一片茫茫白雾，车从雾中穿过。当我们抵达时，吉南朱伊庞大的村寨——鳞次栉比的茅舍、尖顶的小石屋、牲畜围栏，都浸在月下的静谧里。车子驶进村寨，借着车灯，我一眼就看见，在茅草屋檐下，停着那辆吉南朱伊从美国领事手里买下的车。当初在万扬格里的案子里，他就是驾驶着这辆车前往农场做出最终裁决的。车看上去已经完全弃置，通体铁锈，成了废物一堆，显然，吉南朱伊早把它抛在一边，转身走着的还是父辈的老路，一心只想看到牲畜和女人们在自己身边众星捧月。

村子漆黑一片，却没有入睡，一听到车声，人们就起身过来围住我们。但一切都与往常不同了。吉南朱伊的村寨一向熙熙攘攘，嘈杂不堪，像一口地面上的喷泉，泉水向四面八方奔流；就在吉南朱伊的眼皮底下，每个角落都有计划与方案杂乱无章地进行着，而他，爱炫耀，宽大为怀，是中心人物。现在死亡的翅翼覆盖在村寨上，而且恰如强磁场，改变了磁力下的图样，构成了新的星罗棋布、新的人以群分。这个大家庭，乃至于全种族的福祉，都成为了赌注，此类各怀鬼胎的场景，百般阴谋诡计，时常在君王临终的灵床前上演，你意识到，此刻在牛群的强烈骚味里，在朦胧的月色间，也在愈演愈烈。

我从来不曾进入吉南朱伊的内宅。这座宫池远比传统的基库尤人棚屋高大巍峨，但当我跨步进去，才发现里面并无更多的豪华家具：木棍用宽带子绑在一起就是床架，几个木墩子是用来坐的。夯实的泥土地上，点着两三堆火，棚屋里热得让人透不过气来，浓烟弥漫，虽然地上立着一盏防风灯，起初我还是一个人也看不见。等多少适应了环境后，才看到有三位秃顶的老人，是吉南朱伊的叔伯或者参谋吧，一位古稀之年的老太太拄着拐杖靠床站着，一个年轻美貌的少女，一个13岁的少年——在酋长的死亡之室里，他们是隶属于磁场作用下的哪一支利益集体呢？

吉南朱伊直挺挺平躺在床上。他已经垂危，半个身子已踏入死界，是半死之人。他身边臭气熏天，开始我都不敢开口说话，怕会吐出来。老人全身赤裸，躺在一张我送给他的苏格兰花格呢毯上，很可能是他感染生疽的腿承受不了任何负担。那条腿看上去很可怕，肿胀膨大，连膝盖的位置都辨不出来，在灯光里，我看到，他自臀及踝，到处都是或黑或黄的条痕，纵横交错。腿下方的毛毯黑乎乎的，湿了一大片，仿佛脓水是从里面涌出来的。

吉南朱伊那位去农场接我过来的儿子拿进一把古旧的欧式椅，有一条腿比另三条短了一截。他把椅子紧挨床边放下，让我坐。

吉南朱伊瘦得只剩皮包骨，头脸和躯干憔悴之极，骨架在皮肤底下根根戳着，看去像一尊用刻刀粗粗刻就的巨型乌木雕像。嘴微张，牙齿和舌头都露了出来。黑黑的脸孔上，眼珠浑浊不清，灰蒙蒙的半盲。但他还能看见，当我走到床边时，他视线转向我。我在棚屋里的时候，他的眼光没离开过我的脸。

他缓缓地、吃力地拖动右手，越过身体上方碰了碰我的手。他正痛得死去活来，却还保持着体面；躺在床上一丝不挂，举手投足仍然分量十足。从他的表情，我猜测他为自己班师回朝而得意扬扬，因为他成功带回了所有牲口，不顾马赛女婿们的百般阻挠。我坐在那里凝视着他，想起他有一个弱点：他怕打雷。一次，他正在我府上，一个大雷炸响，他吓得像只小老鼠，左顾右盼想找个地洞钻。而现在，他不用再怕闪电挥舞，不用再怕雷霆暴作；我想，世间工作他已彻底完成，领了各方面的工资后回家安息。如果他神智还足够清晰，回首生平时会发现不称心如意的事儿只有很少几次。强大的生命力、寻欢作乐的能力、各种各样的活动，此刻都走到了尽头，而吉南朱伊静静躺着。“瞑目安眠，归于寂灭。”(1)——我心中默道。

棚屋里的老者们始终默默伫立，仿佛口不能言。我进来时就在屋里的那个少年，估计是吉南朱伊的老来子，现在走近父亲床边，开始和我说话。我猜想，是背诵我来之前他们就商量好的内容。

他说道：传教团来的医生听说吉南朱伊的病情，已经出诊过了，并且告诉基库尤人，将再次来访，把病危的酋长带到传教团医院去，估计今晚传教团的车就会到。但吉南朱伊不想去医院。所以他派人找我来，希望我带他去我家。他希望我马上出发，赶在传教团的人回来之前。少年说话时，吉南朱伊一直看着我。

我端坐静听，心情沉重。

如果吉南朱伊是在过去任何时间陷入弥留，一年前甚至三个月前，只要他开口，我都会毫不犹豫带他回家。但时移势往，最近我处境相当艰难，而我害怕它会更加恶化。我在内罗毕处理了一天事务，聆听商人和律师们的意见，与农场的债权人会面。我的家，吉南朱伊要我带他回去的，已经不再是我的家。

我坐着，看向吉南朱伊，想，他正在死去，肯定活不成了。他很可能在我开车回家的路上就去世，或者一进家门就咽气。传教团将出面把他的死亡归咎于我；每个人听说这情形，也会同意他们的说法。

坐在棚屋里的旧椅子上，所有这一切对我来说，都沉重得无法承担。我不再能挺身而出，面对全世界的强权。现在我不敢挑战任一种威势，遑论他们全体。

我两三次想下定决心带吉南朱伊回家，每一次都气馁。于是我想，我该走了。

法拉站在门边，专心听少年的表述。他见我犹自静坐，便走到我身边，热切的声音压得很低，向我说明如何安妥地把吉南朱伊搬上车。我起身，和他一道退到棚屋后面，多少能避开众人的眼光和床上老人散发的恶臭。我告诉法拉，我不能带上吉南朱伊一起走。法拉万万不曾料到事态有此转折，整张脸和眼眸都因惊讶而阴沉下来。

我很愿意再和吉南朱伊待一会儿，但我不想眼睁睁看传教团的人露面带走他。

我走到吉南朱伊床边，告诉他我没法带他回我家。不需要给出理由，所以我们也没再说什么。棚屋中的老人们，当他们弄明白我拒绝了，围了上来，身体不安地颤抖，少年向后退了一步，木然伫立，他已经没什么可做的了。吉南朱伊本人没有发抖，一动也不动，眼睛像刚才一样紧盯着我。他的表情仿佛在说，这样的事他之前也遇见过——很可能真是这样。

“卡哇合瑞（再见），吉南朱伊。”我说。

他滚烫的指头在我掌心轻轻碰了一下。走到棚屋门前时，我转头回看，屋里光线幽暗，烟雾缭绕，完全遮蔽了我的基库尤酋长那四肢摊开的庞大身躯。走出棚屋后，夜色寒冷。月亮西沉到地平线上，一定已经过了午夜。就在这时，吉南朱伊的村寨里，公鸡喔喔地啼了两声。

当晚，吉南朱伊在传教团医院过世。次日下午，他的两个儿子到我家报丧，葬礼一天后将在达戈莱蒂地区他的村子附近举行，我受邀出席。

如果由基库尤人自己做主，他们是不埋葬死者的，而是曝尸旷野，任鬣狗和秃鹫随意处理。这习俗对我颇有吸引力，我觉得躺在日月星辰之下，被如此迅速、利落而大模大样地啄取一空，清除干净，应该是件心旷神怡的事。人与大自然融为一体，成为风景中普普通通的一分子。西班牙流感在农场上肆虐的日子，我整晚都听见鬣狗在自留地上转悠，之后经常在森林里高高的野草间或者草原上，发现光溜溜的褐色头盖骨，像树上掉下来的一颗坚果。但这一行为是不见容于文明社会的。为了改变基库尤人的生活方式，政府不惜大动干戈教他们把死者埋在地里，但基库尤人对此十分抵触。

吉南朱伊，他们告诉我，将被土葬。我想，基库尤人之所以同意破例，是因为亡者是一位酋长，也许他们也乐于借机好好秀一下民族风采，小聚一番。翌日下午，我驱车前往达戈莱蒂，指望会看到本地所有上了年纪的小酋长，并且观瞻一场盛大的基库尤葬礼。

但吉南朱伊的葬礼全盘欧化，完全是宗教仪式。几位政府代表出席，是地方长官和两位内罗毕来的官员。当天此处所有活动由教会掌控；在午后的暖阳下，教士的黑袍令草原显得黑压压一片。法国传教团，以及圣公会、苏格兰长老会传教团，都派出了大批教士。如果他们是想让基库尤人深刻意识到：他们为死去的酋长行了按手礼(2)，他从此是教会的人了——那么，他们赢了。显然，他们拥有无上的权威，吉南朱伊想摆脱简直是白日做梦。这是教会的惯有伎俩了。在这里，我第一次看到了数量庞大、难以计数的传教团小厮——皈依基督的原住民，穿得半僧半俗，不知道能派什么用场，都是肥胖的基库尤年轻人，戴着眼镜，双手合抱在胸前，像一堆阴阳怪气的太监。也许吉南朱伊那两位基督徒儿子也在里面，为了这个大日子压下各自的宗教歧见。但我不认识他们长什么样。几位老酋长也出席了葬礼，吉奥伊也来了，我与他聊了几句吉南朱伊。葬礼全程中，他们始终都站得远远的，隐身于仪式的背景人群中。

吉南朱伊的墓穴挖在几棵草原上高大的桉树下，一根绳子把周围拦上。我来得早，站得很靠近墓穴，就在绳栏旁边，能看到吊客们围拢过来，越聚越多，各自落脚，像一群苍蝇。

他们用货车把吉南朱伊的遗体从教会运来了，棺材被抬到墓穴旁边。当我目睹他的遗容，有生以来，再没有哪一刻像此刻一样，我莫名恐惧，心惊胆寒。他一向是个大块头，我记得他在众人前呼后拥中到农场做客时的威风八面，甚至两夜之前，他躺在床上奄奄一息时也是条大汉，但盛着他的这具棺材几乎是个正方形，长度肯定不足一米半。当我第一眼看到时，根本没当那是个棺材：想这准是葬礼用具箱。但这是吉南朱伊的棺柩。为什么选了这具，我无从得知，可能是苏格兰长老会传教团里正好有这么一具吧。而他们是怎么把吉南朱伊弄进去的，他能躺得舒服吗？这当口儿，他们把棺材搁到了地上，就在我脚边。

棺材上有一个大银盘，上面镌有铭文，后来我听说，那是注明棺材是传教会赠予吉南朱伊酋长的，还引用了一句《圣经》文本。

葬礼十分漫长。一个接一个，传教士们上前发言，我猜里面一定有大量的表白、无限的忠告。但我什么也没听见，只是紧紧抓住吉南朱伊墓穴旁的绳栏。他们之后，一些原住民教众也相继上台，驴叫般的声音响彻青翠的草原。

最终，吉南朱伊入土为安，葬在故乡的田野上，故乡的土掩埋了他。

我带了几位僮仆到达戈莱蒂，让他们也见识一下葬礼。葬礼后他们要和本地的亲戚朋友们碰个面聊下天，然后自己步行回农场，所以法拉与我开车先走。一路上，法拉沉默如那座被我们抛在身后的坟冢。我不肯带吉南朱伊回家的事，法拉很难接受，这两天他看上去魂儿都没了，陷在巨大的怀疑和绝望里，难以自拔。

车快到门口了，他说：“没事儿的，姆萨比。”

山中坟茔


丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿结束了一次远征狩猎后，来农场待了几天，但是，当我开始解散佣仆，收拾行李，他待不下去了，搬到内罗毕的休·马丁家去住。他每天都从那里开车到农场上来，跟我一起吃晚饭，坐在——到了最后，家具也已经售罄——包装箱上，把另一个包装箱当作餐桌。我俩时常对坐到夜深。

好几次，我与丹尼斯说话时，表现得就像真的即将离开这个国家。他视非洲为家，也非常了解我，虽然会取笑我遣散佣仆时的沮丧，此刻也陪我一起难过。

“你真觉得，”他说，“没有斯朗加，你就活不了啦？”

“是的。”我答。

但绝大多数时候，当我们同在一起，会说说笑笑，一举一动就像未来根本不会来；为以后担忧不是他的风格，仿佛他有把握，一旦需要，能从未知处汲取能量。他很自然地顺应我的安排：对万事都听之任之，其他人说什么想什么都随便。当他在家的时候，在一座空荡荡的房子里坐在包装箱上，似乎是一件很正常的事，且与我们的品味十分耦合。他改编了一首诗给我：

务必将你悲哀的谣曲

以欢乐的方式吟唱，

我再不为怜悯而来，

只为欢乐而至。(1)



那几个星期里，我们经常驾驶飞机短途飞行，在恩贡山脉或者野生动物区上空徜徉。一天早晨，太阳刚刚升起，丹尼斯就到农场带我出发，在山脉以南的高原上，我们看到了一头狮子。

他说他要把书打包，那些书已在我家放了很多年。但说说而已，一直没有进一步的行动。

“你留着吧，”他说，“现在我没地方搁它们。”

我家封门之后的去处他根本拿不定主意。一次，拗不过朋友一直的建议，他甚至开车去了内罗毕一趟，看一套出租的别墅，但他回家时心烦得只字不想提。在饭桌上，他刚开始向我描述那座房子，便突然停嘴，沉默片刻，脸上浮现出嫌恶和哀伤，使他完全不像平日的他。他刚刚接触到了一种新的生活方式，想到这种方式他都难以承受。

但这不满纯粹是就事论事、对事不对人，他已经忘记他本人曾经打算以这种方式生活下去，每当我提起，便打断我。“哦，说到我，”他说，“我在马赛人居留区搭个帐篷，或者在索马里人村庄找个房，就是天堂日子了。”

话已至此，这一次，仅这一次，他说到了我在欧洲的未来。觉得我应该会比在农场开心，能把我们在非洲逐渐形成的“某种文明”完全抛开。“你知道的，”他说下去，“非洲大陆总有一种辛辣讽刺的幽默感。”

丹尼斯在海滨有一片土地，位于泰考格海湾，蒙巴萨岛北向五十千米。那是一座昔日阿拉伯城池的旧址，还保存着一座非常古朴的清真寺尖塔和一口水井——盐碱地上到处都是被岁月剥蚀的灰色风化岩，零星有几棵古老的芒果树。他在那里盖了一间小屋，我曾经去过。景色一如仙境，宁静而浩瀚，碧蓝的印度洋就在你面前，让你知道海之博大。深邃的泰考格海湾向南延伸，极目所见，沿岸长长的全是粉灰和黄色的珊瑚礁，陡峭且连绵不绝。

退潮时，从家门向海边信步而行，几千米下来，仿佛漫步在广阔的、不太平整的露天广场上，各种奇形怪状的棱角长贝壳和海星俯拾皆是。斯瓦希里渔夫们也来这里转悠，围着缠腰布，裹着红色或蓝色头巾，活像水手辛巴达(2)再世，向我们推销着七彩缤纷的刺突鱼，有些其实相当美味。房子下方的海滩上，有一排被海土淘空的窑洞和岩穴，可以坐在洞中乘凉，眺望远处闪闪烁烁的蔚蓝海洋。涨潮时，海水漫过洞穴，一直漫到房子地基处的水平线上，透过多孔透水的珊瑚岩，能听见大海别样的叹息声和歌咏，仿佛你脚下所踩的大地是活的；一排排海浪奔腾进泰考格海湾，有如千军万马一般。

我在泰考格还度过一个月圆之夜，夜色如此璀宁静，美景令人为之心折。睡在屋里，房门大开，门外就是银光粼粼的海面；微微的暖风似是在与人嬉戏，随着低低的飒飒声，松散的细沙被吹到了房内的石头地板上。一晚，一队阿拉伯单桅帆船队驶过，紧贴着岸边，季风无声地推它们向前，月下，褐色的帆影渐行渐远。

丹尼斯有时说要在泰考格安家，从那里出发去远征狩猎。当我开始提起离开农场的事，他让我住到泰考格他家去，就像在高原上他住我家一样。但白人无法长期居住在海滨，除非能把家居环境营造得很舒适，再说泰考格对我来说，地势太低，气候也太炎热。

那年五月我就要离开非洲了，在我出发前，丹尼斯要去泰考格待一星期。他计划建造一所大一些的房子，在田地里种上芒果树。他是驾驶飞机去的，打算中途绕道沃伊(3)，看看那里是否有大象可以狩猎。原住民之间口口相传，都说一群大象从西方迁移到了沃伊，其中有一头体积特别庞大，有两头别的象加起来那么大，经常在灌木丛附近独自出没。

丹尼斯总认为自己是一个特别理智的人，但当不祥的预感、特殊的心境浮起，在情绪影响下，他会好几天甚至一两个星期都默不作声，自己却纹丝不觉，当我问他出了什么事的时候，他会很诧异。去海滨前一天，他正处在魂不守舍的状态下，仿佛在沉思着什么，但当我问起，他却哈哈大笑。

我叫他带我同去，因为我觉得能看海是一件神清气爽的事。开始他答应了，又改变主意说不行，不能带上我；他说，要飞经沃伊，旅途会非常辛苦，他打算中间着陆，在树林中过夜，所以随身带一个原住民仆役很有必要。我提醒他：他亲口说过，要驾驶飞机载我游遍全非洲。是的，他答，他会的；如果沃伊真有大象，只要能找到停机处和宿营地，他会载我飞过去看它们的。只有这么一次，我央求丹尼斯带我上飞机，而他拒绝了。

他出发那天，是五月八号星期五。“下星期四等我。”告别时他说，“我会准时回来，与你共进午餐。”

他发动了车，去内罗毕乘飞机，中途又折返一次，取一本他送给我的诗集，准备路上带在身边。他一只脚踩在车的踏脚板上，把一根手指按在书页上，向我念出了那一首我们讨论过的诗。

“这是你喜欢的那首《灰雁》(4)。”他说。

我看到灰雁飞越平原，

野雁的翅翼在高空拍得响亮——

从天之涯到另一个天之涯，它们永不停步，

灵魂在咽喉处坚如铁石——

太阳车的轮辐跌过叠翠起伏的山峦，晴空无尽，

它们是横跨天幕的一条灰白缎条。



随即他就永远离开了我，向我最后挥一挥手。

丹尼斯在蒙巴萨降落，着地时折断了一只螺旋桨。他拍电报到内罗毕索取备用件，东非航空公司派了一个小伙子把备用件给他送到蒙巴萨。飞机修好后，丹尼斯又一次整装待发，他叫航空公司的小伙子和他一起去。但小伙子不愿意。小伙子经常飞行，与很多人同行过，之前也跟丹尼斯飞过，深知丹尼斯驾驶技术高超。原住民很佩服他的本事，就像佩服他其他方面的才能一样。但这一次，小伙子就是不肯和他一起上机。

很久之后，这个小伙子在内罗毕遇到法拉，还聊起这事，小伙子告诉法拉：“那天，哪怕给我一百卢比，我也不会跟先生一起走的。”死亡的阴影，在恩贡山的最后几天，丹尼斯自己已有所感，而到那一刻，原住民比他感受还要强烈。

于是丹尼斯带上了他自己的仆人卡莫。可怜的卡莫很害怕飞行。在农场上，他曾经告诉我，每当飞机起飞离开地面后，他一路双眼都紧盯着脚尖，一动也不动，直到重新回到地面为止。他觉得，万一他向机舱外瞥一眼，发现飞得那么高，景物都离自己那么远，准得给吓死。

星期四那天，我一直在等丹尼斯。我估算他应该在日出时分从沃伊起飞，到恩贡山是两小时航程。但他始终没到，我有事要去内罗毕处理，便开车进城了。

在非洲的时候，一旦生病或者焦虑过甚，我就会被一种特别的强迫观念困扰。似乎我正举步维艰，如履薄冰，周围的一切都是危险疾苦，而在灾难的中央，我自己不知怎的站错了队，因此被所有人怀疑排斥甚至惧惮。

这梦魇其实是对一战期间情形的回忆。那时有好几年，殖民地上的人们都坚信我骨子里是个亲德派，总用猜忌的眼光看我。这猜疑并非凭空而来，虽然我问心无愧。大战爆发前不久，我曾亲自去奈瓦沙，为德军东非的冯·莱托将军购买马匹。六个月前，我们是同船抵达非洲的，当时他托我帮他挑选十匹埃塞俄比亚种用母马，但刚到非洲，我有千头万绪的事要考虑，把这茬忘得干干净净。到后来，他一直写信催我母马的事，我终于到奈瓦沙为他买了。战争随后爆发，母马们根本无法出境到他手里。但我仍然无法回避这个事实，那就是：在大战爆发时为德军购买军马。还好，我哥哥志愿参加英国军队出征，并在罗伊城以北的亚眠(5)战役中荣获维多利亚十字勋章，众人对我的不信任才烟消云散，没有持续到战争后期。此事甚至登在《东非旗帜报》上，大标题为：一枚东非的维多利亚十字勋章。

当时我对自己的孤立并不在乎，因为我完全不是亲德派，认为一旦确属必要，我能澄清事实。但这事对我的伤害一定比我知道的要深得多，许多年后，每当疲累或者发高烧，被弃绝感就会卷土重来。我在非洲的最后一个月里，每一件事都在出岔子，好几次，这种感觉一团黑雾般劈头盖脸罩住我，某种程度上我很害怕，觉得这是一种精神错乱的征兆。

那个星期四，在内罗毕，这噩梦不期而至，我全无防备，它却越来越强烈，以至于我起了疑心：是不是我要开始疯了。不知怎么的，城中笼着沉重的哀伤，也笼在我遇到的每个人身上，在这气氛中，人人都在躲着我。没人停下脚步跟我打招呼，我的朋友们一看到我，就钻进车里扬长而去。甚至杂货店的苏格兰老板老邓肯先生，我从他那里买杂物已经很多年了，还跟他在总督府舞会上跳过舞，当我走进店里时，他神色慌张地看着我，然后走出去。我恍然觉得，在内罗毕我是孤零零一个人，有如身在荒岛。

我把法拉留在农场上准备迎接丹尼斯，所以无人可以攀谈。基库尤人在这种情况下是派不上用场的，因为他们对现实的理解以及他们自己的现实都与我们的全然不同。不过我要与麦克米兰夫人在奇若莫饭店共进午餐，在那里应该能遇到可以聊聊天的白人，让我的心态平和下来。

我驱车经过长长的种满竹子的林荫道，来到奇若莫饭店，那是一座古老的内罗毕式建筑，此时正在举办午宴。但在奇若莫饭店里，与内罗毕街头一模一样的事发生了。每个人都一副伤心难过的样子，我一迈步进去，谈话声戛然而止。我坐在老朋友布尔佩特先生身边，但他始终眼睛下视，只跟我支吾一两声。阴影沉沉地压在我身上，我试图摆脱，和他聊起他在墨西哥登山的经历，但他仿佛什么都不记得了。

我想：这些人对我不好，我要回农场去。丹尼斯现在应该到了。我们会好好聊天，好好做事，我会重归清醒，能搞明白弄清楚眼前的一切。

餐会结束后，麦克米兰女士带我走进她的小客厅，在那里告诉我：沃伊发生了事故，丹尼斯偕机坠毁，当场身亡。

当时，我心里正在想：甚至只要一听到丹尼斯的名字，真相就会大白，我就能搞明白弄清楚眼前的一切。

后来，沃伊的地方长官写信给我，说明了事故的详情。丹尼斯在沃伊时，是在他府上过的夜，第二天早上他驾飞机向农场出发，同机者还有他的仆人。起飞后不久，飞机便掉头急遽回返，当时高度很低，只有六十米左右。突然飞机左右摇摆起来，疯狂旋转，像一只折翼的鸟儿般一头栽了下来。撞击地面后机身起火，跑去施救的人们都被火势阻挡。当他们找到树枝和沙土扑灭火势后，发现飞机已经撞得粉碎，机舱中的两个人均已在坠机中身亡。

之后多年，殖民地的人们仍视丹尼斯的死为无可挽回的损失。平凡的当地移民们对他倾注了美好的感情，他的价值超出他们的理解范围，他们不懂，但他们尊敬。当他们说到他，最常说到的就是：他是个运动健将；他们把他板球赛和高尔夫球赛中的丰功伟绩一一道来，这些我从来没听他说过，直到这一刻我才知道他在运动场上是全方位出色。当他们用尽溢美之词称道他的体育生涯时，往往会加一句：当然了，他才华横溢。大家深深怀念的，是他绝不自私，绝不自恋，毫无保留地真诚。除他之外，这样的品质我只在白痴身上遇见过。在殖民地，这样做派的人一般不会被树为楷模，但当他过世后，也许能得到比其他地方更多的真诚敬慕。

原住民比白人更了解丹尼斯。对他们来说，失去他如同亲人丧生。

在内罗毕获悉丹尼斯的死讯后，我立刻决意赶往沃伊。航空公司派汤姆·布莱克调查汇报这起事故，我便驱车前往航空公司请他捎上我同去。但当我到了公司，他的飞机已经起飞前往沃伊了。

开车过去也是可行的，但正值雨季，我得事先了解一下路况。当我坐待路况报告时，我想起来，丹尼斯跟我说过：他但愿死后葬在恩贡山。真奇怪，之前根本没想起来这回事儿，我脑海中竟没想到这意味着要把他埋葬。此刻，仿佛有一幅画卷在我面前缓缓展开。

山脉间，野生动物保护区的第一处山脊上，有一处我曾经指给丹尼斯看，说那是我未来的埋骨处。当时我以为我会生是非洲人，死是非洲鬼。晚上并肩而坐，从我家远望群山，他评论说他自己也很愿意埋在那里。从那时起，几次开车入山，丹尼斯会说：“一直开到我们的墓地去吧。”有一次，为了寻找野牛，我们在山上野营，那个下午我们爬上山梁，想凑近细看一下那块地方。从山梁放眼出去，景色无比壮丽；夕阳余晖下，我们既能看到肯尼亚山，又能看到乞力马扎罗山。丹尼斯吃了个橘子，躺在草地上，对我说：他真想待在这儿不走了。我自己的埋骨地比丹尼斯选的高一点儿。从这两处向东眺望，都能透过森林远远看到我的家。我们第二天又去了一次。我想，这就是永恒，虽然老少皆知，每个人都是要死的。

古斯塔夫·摩尔一听说丹尼斯的噩耗，立刻到我家来，发现我不在家，便到内罗毕找我。过了一会儿，休·马丁也来了，陪我们一起坐着。我告诉他们丹尼斯的遗愿，以及山中的埋骨地，他们马上给沃伊有关人士拍电报。我还没到农场，消息便来了，丹尼斯的遗体将于次日早晨用火车运回，葬礼安排在中午时分，在山里举行。到时，我必须事先准备好墓地。

古斯塔夫·摩尔陪我一起回农场，在我家过夜，方便明天一大清早帮我忙。我们天不亮就要动身上山确定墓地位置，及时挖好墓穴。

雨下了一夜，我们上路时，绵绵细雨还在下个不停。路上的车辙里积满了水。开车上山，仿佛在云雾里开车，既看不见左手下方的平原，也看不见右手上方的山坡；工人乘坐卡车跟随在我们身后，十米开外，就看不到卡车的影子了，山路弯弯曲曲向上，雾越来越厚重。凭着路边的界标，我们知道已经进入了保护区，再向前开了几百米后，我们便下了车，让车停在山路上，工人在车上等着，直到我们发现要找的地方。清晨空气严寒，冻得我手指刺痛起来。

墓地不能离马路太远，也不能太陡峭，否则卡车开不过去。我们一行人谈论着雾气，一起走了一会儿，在岔道口分开，各自沿着不同的小道向前走。几秒钟后，就谁也看不见谁了。

雄伟的山川在我身边偶尔一露脸，又随即被浓雾遮蔽，这一天真的很像我北方故国的雨天。法拉走在我身边，背着一杆湿漉漉的步枪，担心我们会误撞野牛群。沿路树木山石会突然从雾里钻出来，在我们眼前浮现，看去大得不可思议。野橄榄树上的灰色枝叶，以及没过我们头顶的高高的野草，都在滴水，散发着浓烈的气息。——我穿着橡胶雨衣和橡胶雨靴，但没多久就全身湿透，像从河里捞出来一样。山间一片死寂，只是偶尔雨声会骤然变大，四面八方都是淅淅沥沥声。突然雾气散开，一片靛蓝大地在我面前铺开来，越过我延展开去，有如板岩——这一定是远方高高山峰中的一座——但只是片刻光景，它重又被飘移不定的灰蒙蒙雨雾覆盖。我走呀走，到最后，我站住了，心如死灰。除非天气放晴，否则我们什么也做不了。

古斯塔夫·摩尔大声喊了我三四次，才找到我的位置，过来时，脸上手上都是雨水。他告诉我，他已经在浓雾里转悠了一个小时，如果现在还不能定下墓地的位置，就无法及时准备好了。

“但是我看不见我们在哪里，”我说，“不能把他葬在视野会被山坡挡住的位置。再等一会儿吧。”

在高高的草丛中，我们默然伫立，我吸了一支烟。就在我扔掉烟蒂的刹那，雾散了一点儿。天宇仍黯淡苍白，但渐渐清晰起来。不到十分钟，我们就看清自己身在何处。平原就在我们脚下，能看到我们来时的路，沿着山坡蜿蜒曲折，向我们一路攀升，且继续蜿蜒向上。远远的南面，在变幻的云彩下方，是乞力马扎罗青翠的山坡静静躺卧。当我们转向北面，天更亮了，有一瞬间，一抹薄薄的天光，从天边斜射下来，给肯尼亚山肩镀上了一层闪亮的银边。突然间，更近处，在我们脚下的东面，万绿万灰中一点红，此地唯一的一点红，是森林开阔处我家的红瓦房顶。不用再走远了，就是这里。片刻之后，雨又下大了。

我们站的位置上方大概二十米处，山腹处有一条天然形成的窄窄平台，我们借助罗盘在平台上标注了墓地的位置，坐西朝东。我们喊来工人，安排他们用非洲大砍刀把草除净，挖开湿湿的泥土。摩尔带上几个工人和他一起为卡车开路。从公路到墓地这一段，他们铲平地面，砍下灌木丛横生的枝杈，再把小树枝铺在路面上，防止打滑。靠近墓穴的地方，有一处太过陡峭，道路只能到那里为止，无法直通墓穴。直到此刻，山中一片静冥，但工人们动手后，我听见前山后川处处都有回音在鸣响，呼应着铁锹的撞击声，像一只小狗在吠。

车辆陆续从内罗毕开来，我们派了个人为他们带路，否则群山万壑间，他们很难留意到矮树丛中墓穴旁忙活的这一撮人。内罗毕的索马里人也来了，把骡车留在马路上，三四成行，缓步上山，他们都用布把头缠了起来，仿佛想退世隐居，这是索马里人表达哀思的方式。丹尼斯住在北方的一些朋友听闻讣告，纷纷从奈瓦沙、吉尔-吉尔和艾尔曼提亚(6)开车赶来，车身上覆满长途疾驰沾上的泥浆。天气逐渐放晴，我们上方，四座山峰顶天立地，现出巍峨身姿。

正午刚过，丹尼斯的遗骸从内罗毕运来了，沿着通往坦噶尼喀那一条他远征狩猎时走过的路，在湿滑泥泞中缓缓行驶。车停在最后那个陡峭的山坡处，他们抬出棺柩，把窄长的棺柩扛在肩上，上面覆着国旗。灵柩放入墓穴的刹那，山河变色，仿佛变成葬礼的布景，如斯沉静，群山肃穆而立，它们深知我们在做什么，也万分怜恤；随后主持葬礼的就是群山本身，这是山川与他之间的一件事，而在场人等不过是在布景板上微不足道的旁观者。

丹尼斯观赏过也亲身走过非洲高原上的每一条道路，比所有其他白人更了解这片土地、土地上的四季轮回、一草一木和野生动物、吹过来的风以及山野的芳香。他随时观察着阴晴变化、人文风情、云霞、夜晚的繁星。就在山里，这个位置上，仅仅是不久前，我还见过他在午后的阳光下，不戴帽子，举着双筒望远镜，极目远眺，如饥如渴地寻觅着这方大地的细枝末节。非洲的一切，他悉数接受，在他的眼中与脑海里，它已经变了样子，加上了属于他的独特印记，成为他的一部分。现在非洲反过来接受他，改变他，使他成为非洲大地的一部分。

他们告诉我，因为时间紧迫，临时选就的墓地来不及被封圣认可(7)，内罗毕的主教拒绝前来。但另一个教士在现场主持了丧礼仪式，那些繁文缛节我都没听说过，在广阔的山里，他的声音小而清脆，仿佛山雀在鸣叫。我想丹尼斯一定巴不得仪式越早结束越好。教士念出经文：“我要向山举目。”(8)

其他白人一一离去后，古斯塔夫·摩尔与我又坐了一会儿。伊斯兰教徒们等我们走远，才趋近墓边为亡者祈福。

丹尼斯逝后那段日子，他在远征狩猎中的仆从们都陆陆续续来了，聚在农场上。他们不说来意，也不提要求，只是背靠在屋外墙上，席地而坐，手背撑在地砖上。与原住民习惯相反，他们大部分时间都沉默不语。马里姆和撒·西塔来了，他们是丹尼斯最勇敢无畏、机灵精干的扛枪人和向导，每一次远征狩猎中都不离他左右。他们随威尔士亲王狩猎过，许多年后，亲王还记得他们的名字，说他们双剑合璧，天下无敌。此刻，出色的向导迷失了方向，一动不动地呆坐着。丹尼斯的司机卡努侠也来了。他在艰险的山路上驶过几千几万里程，是一个身材细长的基库尤青年，有一双猴子般机警的眼睛，现在坐在屋外，像一只被困在笼中、冻得哆哆嗦嗦、担惊受怕的猴子。

比利阿·伊萨，丹尼斯的索马里仆人，从奈瓦沙到了农场。比利阿曾两度随丹尼斯去英国，在那里上过学，英语说得像位绅士。几年前，丹尼斯和我在内罗毕参加过比利阿的婚礼；那是一场盛大的欢宴，整整热闹了七天。婚礼上，这位出色的行者和书生又恢复了祖祖辈辈的传统习惯，身穿金色长袍，迎接我们时一躬到地，挥剑起舞时舞姿狂野，有如沙漠中的亡命之徒。比利阿瞻仰过老东家的陵墓，在墓旁坐了坐；从墓地回来后，他几乎不怎么说话，过了一会儿，他与其他人一道背靠墙在房外坐下，手背垂在地上。

法拉出门与悼客们聊了几句。他自己也非常难过。“哪怕你离开非洲，”他对我说，“只剩先生一个人还在这里，可能情况也不会这么糟。”

丹尼斯的仆人们待了大概一星期，然后一个接一个地散去了。

我经常开车到丹尼斯的墓地去。我家与那里的直线距离不过八千米，但盘山路却要二十四千米。墓地比我家高出三百米，那里的空气格外不同寻常，清澈有如杯水；当你摘帽，柔柔的轻风会拂起你的发梢；山顶上，浮云自东向西飘飘荡荡，把云影投在波浪般起伏的广袤大地上，过了东非大裂谷后，浮云便融化在空气中，无影无踪。

我从杂货店买下一米白布，原住民称之为“美国布”(9)。法拉与我在墓地下方立起三根长竿，把布钉在上面，当我从家中远望，就能够认出墓穴的准确地点，像青山间的一个小白点。

雨下得越来越大，我很担心墓草长势过猛，会盖住坟头，以后就找不到坟茔了。于是有一天，我收拾了所有车道上的白石头，就是卡罗门亚曾经不惮劳苦又扛又推到我家门口的那些，把它们搁在车厢里，运上山。我们砍净墓地旁的草，把大石头围成长方形作为标志；现在这个地方就好找了。

我经常到墓地去，也会带上仆人们的孩子，他们很快就熟悉了那里，有人要去拜访，能给那人指路。在墓地旁的矮树丛中，他们修了一座小小的凉亭。那个夏天，丹尼斯的朋友阿里·宾·萨利姆从蒙巴萨来吊唁，以阿拉伯人的哀悼方式，伏在墓地上痛哭。

一天，在墓旁我遇到休·马丁，我们坐在草地上聊了很久。休·马丁为丹尼斯的死痛彻心扉。如果有人曾经在他怪僻、离群索居的生涯中占据过一席之地，那一定是丹尼斯。完美人物是一个不可思议的概念，你绝不相信休会给谁以殊荣，当那人是完美人物；你也不会想到一旦失去这样的人，会对他有致命影响，简直像切除了重要器官一样。丹尼斯仙逝后，他明显老了，相貌大变，形容枯槁，脸上还长满了斑斑点点，但他的表情仍然带着弥勒佛般淡淡的平和笑意，仿佛心中有大喜乐，隐不示人。这次他对我说，一天晚上，他突然警醒，想到丹尼斯最恰如其分的墓志铭。我想是来自一位古希腊作家的诗句，他先用希腊文向我念了一遍，然后用英文复述，以便我能听懂。内文如下：“死亡之尘掩埋了生命之火，我却全然不惜。因我终于万事大吉。”

后来，丹尼斯的兄长温奇尔西伯爵在他的墓上立了一块方尖碑，碑铭引自《古舟子咏》。这是丹尼斯非常心爱的一首诗。而在丹尼斯为我吟诵之前，我甚至没听过——第一次他为我朗读，我记得，就是前往比利阿婚礼的路上。我没有见过那块方尖牌；我走后它才立起来。

在英格兰也有丹尼斯的纪念碑。他伊顿公学的校友们为了纪念他，在母校两片运动场间的小河上修了一座石桥。石头桥栏上镌有他的名字、他进校及毕业的日期，另一边桥栏上有如下字句：“英容宛在运动场。挚友们敬上。”

在英国柔美风景里的小河与非洲迤逦的山脊之间，是他一生的行迹；看去似乎飘蓬不定，那只是视觉错误——真正峰回路转的，是环境本身。一支箭，从伊顿桥边的弓弦出发，沿着自己的轨迹，最终落在恩贡山中的墓碑上。

我离开非洲后，古斯塔夫·摩尔写信给我说，在丹尼斯墓上有一桩我闻所未闻的奇事。“马赛人向地区长官报告说，”他写道，“他们曾经多次在太阳初升和下山的时候，看到有狮子在芬奇-哈顿的墓上停留。一头雄狮和一头雌狮经常会去，在墓上或站或卧，待很长时间。一些乘卡车去卡亚多的印度人，路经这里时也看到过。你走后，墓地附近的山坡已被整饬平整，变成了一个大平台。我猜平台对狮子们来说是个好地方，从那里，他们可以俯瞰平原上的牲畜和其他猎物。”

狮子为丹尼斯守墓，使这里成为一块非洲纪念碑，真是恰到好处，有如膜拜。“墓草长新，永留追忆。”(10)我想起特拉法尔加广场上的纳尔逊勋爵纪念牌(11)，他的狮子不过是用石头刻成的而已。

法拉与我倾家抛售


现在只有我一个人孤零零在农场上了。农场不再属于我，但买家允许我无限期停留。在法律上这是一种租赁关系，于是我每天付一先令租金。

为了把家具全部卖掉，可把法拉和我忙坏了。我们把所有瓷器和玻璃杯都放在餐桌上摆卖；餐桌卖掉后，我们就把它们放在地上，排成一长列。咕咕钟里的布谷鸟每小时都跳出来，对它们趾高气扬地高唱，然后它自己也被卖掉了，小鸟儿一去不复返。一天玻璃杯遇到了买家，到了晚上我前思后想，第二天天刚亮，我就开车到了内罗毕，请那位买下它们的女士答应取消交易，退货给我。我没位置放玻璃杯，但多少朋友的指尖和嘴唇曾经碰触过它们，他们带给我美酒，用它们一饮而尽；旧日餐桌上的谈话，在酒杯里仍有回音，我不想与它们分开。我想，要实在无计可施，打碎它们倒是容易得很。

我有一架老旧的木制屏风，绘有中国人、苏丹王和黑人，还有几只拴着的狗。屏风一直被安置在壁炉旁。每当夜幕降临，炉火正旺，画上人物呼之欲出，在我给丹尼斯讲的故事中充当了插图。对它端详良久后，我把它叠起来打包装箱，这段日子，画中人物们可以好好休息一下了。

那期间，麦克米兰女士为了纪念亡夫诺思劳普·麦克米兰爵士，在内罗毕为其兴建了纪念馆，即将落成。大厦美轮美奂，还设有图书馆和阅读室。她开车到农场探望我，与我对坐，惆怅地聊了一会儿过去的好时光，并且把我从丹麦老家带来的大部分家具都买下了，准备放在她的图书馆里使用。当知道这些可爱结实、见多识广、款待八方的橱柜书椅还能重聚一堂，在高门大第里与书本为伍，有学者做伴，如同一群生逢乱世的柔弱女子终于在大学找到避难所，我十分欣慰。

我把藏书都装了箱，这些书箱是我的凳子，也当饭桌。在殖民地，书籍在你生活中的意义与在欧洲大不一样；它们能独自操控你生活的一个完整侧面。因此它们若是上品，你会视若拱璧；如果它们劣质，你会气愤难平。你对它们的感受总比你在文明社会里时要强烈得多。

书中虚构的男男女女会陪你一道在农场中徜徉，在玉米田里漫步。他们像精干的士兵，不消你费心，就能迅速找到自己的容身之处。当我彻夜读完《克罗姆庄园》(1)——之前我从没听说过作者，只是信手在内罗毕一家书店买下了它，却惊喜得如同在大海里发现了新的海上绿洲——第二天，当我骑马穿过野生动物保护区的山谷时，一只小羚羊跳了出来，转瞬间，它在我眼前化为正在被赫克利斯爵士和夫人追猎的牡鹿，他们俩身后还有三四十只或黑或黄的哈巴狗。沃尔特·司各特(2)笔下的所有形象在这里都处处可遇；甚至还会碰见奥德修斯与他率领的大军，最不可思议的是，连拉辛(3)创造出来的众多人物，也时有相逢。彼得·史勒米尔(4)穿着七里格靴(5)，大步跨越非洲的高山；蜜蜂小丑阿格赫就住在我河畔的花园里。

其他东西，卖的卖，装箱的装箱，外运的外运，几个月过后，房子成为了“自在之物”，尊贵如一块空落落的头盖骨，冰冷而广阔。人在里面的每一行动都带着回音。草坪上的草长高了，顺着台阶长长地蔓延上来。到最后，屋子里什么也没有了，对我来说，到这种时候，这种状态，这里却似乎比以前更宜居住。

我对法拉说：“我们本来就应该过这样的生活。”

法拉完全理解我，所有索马里人某种程度上内心都是苦行僧。这段日子，法拉在每件事上都尽力而为，全心全意给我帮忙，外表则越来越像一个真正的索马里人，就好像我刚踏上非洲大陆，他到亚丁来接我时，我一眼看到的那样。他对我脚上那双旧鞋担心不已，向我保证说，他已经为之每天向上天祷告，希望它们能坚持到巴黎。

那些天，法拉每天都身着盛装。他有很多好衣服：金线刺绣的阿拉伯背心，是我给他的；非常考究的猩红色制服背心，滚着金边，是伯克利·科尔送他的；还有色泽华美的丝绸包头巾。这些平常他都珍藏在衣柜里，特殊场合才会穿戴。但现在，他把最华贵的衣服都穿上了。在内罗毕大街上，他走在我身后一步之遥，抑或等在政府大厦和律师办公室密布灰尘的台阶上，打扮得就像“所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的”(6)。索马里人是会这么做的。

现在我得为我的马和狗安排未来了。我一直动念想开枪打死它们，但许多朋友都写信给我，希望我把它们留给他们。那之后，每当我骑马出门，狗儿们陪在我身边，想到要打死它们总觉得不太公平。毕竟，它们身上还有如斯旺盛的生命。我花了很长时间才做了决断，在其他事务上，我不记得我曾经这么反反复复过。到最后，还是送了朋友。

我骑着最心爱的马儿枣红去内罗毕，走得非常非常慢，频频向南北张望。我想，枣红一定觉得很奇怪：我们是沿着内罗毕公路走的，为什么不沿着它回来呢？我费了好大力气，才把它弄上奈瓦沙火车的运马车厢安置下来，我站在车厢旁，最后一次，它如丝柔滑的口鼻擦过我的双手和面颊。我绝不容许你离开，枣红，直到你赐福于我。我们曾一道穿过原住民的自留地和棚屋的间隙，寻找通向河流的小路；陡滑的大下坡上，它走得像一匹骡子那么灵巧。在泥浊的河流里，我看到我们俩的倒影，两颗头挨得很近。从此以后，但愿你生活在云雾飘荡的溪谷，向右行，康乃馨吃个够；向左去，小树吃个饱。

当时我有两只年幼的苏格兰猎鹿犬大卫和黛娜，都是大狗黄昏的后裔，我把它们送给一位朋友，他的农场位于吉尔-吉尔附近，它们可以在那里尽享狩猎的乐趣。两条小狗都体格强壮，活泼好动，被拿进车里，准备隆重地从农场送走时，它们呼哧呼哧喘着，紧挨着的两颗头向车窗外探出来，舌头伸得长长的，好像正整装待发，准备追捕一种新奇独特的猎物。犀利的眼睛、矫健的双腿、热血贲张的心脏，都已经远离这幢房子和草地，欢欣地冲向新的原野，时喘时嗅，狂奔乱跑。

一些员工陆续离开农场。咖啡园和咖啡加工厂都不复存在，普莱·辛格发现自己失业了。他不想再在非洲求职，最后决定回印度去。

普莱·辛格能化百炼钢为绕指柔，但一离开工坊，就幼稚得像个孩子。他一点儿也不接受农场的末日，难受了很久，清亮的泪珠顺着黑胡子往下流。有很长一段时间，他天天来烦我，不是出谋划策想让我留在农场，就是道出关于如何运营农场的锦囊妙计。一直以来，那几部机器都是他的骄傲，以至于有一段时间，他经常久久凝视蒸汽机和咖啡干燥机，温柔的黑眼睛揣摩着上面的每一个螺丝，仿佛钉在了上面。终于到最后，他醒悟过来一切都于事无补，一下子全盘放弃，仍然还是很难受，但更多的是逆来顺受，有时当我们遇见，他就喋喋不休跟我讲他的归程安排。他动身时别无他物，随身只有一个小小的工具箱和一套焊接装备，仿佛他的心与生命早已远渡重洋，现在只剩下这个瘦弱老实的褐色躯体和焊盘跟随其后而已。

我打算送普莱·辛格一份礼物为他饯行，很希望他能在我手边的东西里看上什么，但我一开口，他立刻欢欣雀跃地表示想要一枚戒指。我没有戒指，也没钱为他买一枚。这是数月前的事，当时正好丹尼斯开车到农场上跟我一起吃饭，在饭桌上我说起这事。丹尼斯曾经送过我一枚埃塞俄比亚的软金戒指，戒指开口可以随手指粗细而调节。他立刻觉得，我正盯着那枚戒指，有心送给普莱·辛格。他经常抱怨说，无论他送我什么礼物，我都会第一时间转手送给农场上的有色人种。为了防止类似情况发生，他把戒指从我手上取了下来，戴在自己手上，说他将代为保管，直到普莱·辛格走后。几天后，他动身前往蒙巴萨，之后，戒指伴他一道入土。不过，在普莱·辛格出发之前，我变卖家具攒够了钱，在内罗毕买下了他想要的戒指。是一枚硬金戒指，镶了一颗硕大的红宝石，简直像玻璃。普莱·辛格欣喜若狂，又一次洒下了几滴泪珠，我相信这枚戒指能帮他熬过与农场和机器分手的离别之苦。在农场的最后一星期里，他每天都戴着戒指，无论何时到我家来，都伸出手来给我看，脸上洋溢着灿烂的喜悦笑容。在内罗毕火车站，我眼中最后的他，也是这双瘦削黧黑、曾在锻床上狂飙般翻飞过的手。在拥挤闷热的原住民车厢里，普莱·辛格坐在工具箱上，把手伸出窗外上下挥动着，向我告别，戒指上的红宝石像一颗小星星般闪烁着。

普莱·辛格回了旁遮普的老家。他已经很多年没见过家人，只靠书信联系。家人寄来的照片，他都保存在工厂旁他住的波纹钢小屋里，经常既自豪又满怀柔情地拿给我看。普莱·辛格上了开往印度的船后，我收到他好几封信。开头一律是：“亲爱的夫人，再见了。”随后洋洋洒洒说他的近况以及归途中的见闻。




就在丹尼斯去世后一星期左右，我遇到了一件诡异的事。

那天早晨，我躺在床上，回想最近几个月来的桩桩件件，想弄明白到底发生了什么。仿佛是，某种程度上，我踏出了正常的生活轨道，陷入了前所未有的大旋涡。所到之处，大地在我脚下流失，星子从天空跌落。我想起描写诸神黄昏(7)的诗篇，诗中描绘了星辰陨落，深山岩洞里，小矮人们长叹着，死于恐惧。我想，所有这一切不可能只是惊人的巧合，所谓的祸不单行必有内在规律。如果能找出来，我就得救了：我深思着，如果能恰如其分地看待事物，它们之间的连贯性在我脑海中就会一清二楚。我打定主意，我必须起身寻找神示。

许多人觉得寻找神示是不可理喻的行径。这是因为，得有一种别样的心境才能感应，而大部分人无法达到这样的心境。一旦抱持这心境，你乞求神示，答案就不会错失；它会作为对你呼求的响应，飘然而至。就是以这样的方式，一个如有神助的牌手在桌上挑选了十三张牌，拿起这一手牌——它们是一个整体。桌上旁人未察觉任何端倪，他却知道大满贯近在眼前。牌里可有大满贯？对命定的牌手来说，确实有。

我出门寻找神示，漫无目的地走向仆人们的棚屋。一群母鸡已被放出来，在棚屋间跑来跑去。我站了一会儿，看着它们。

法托玛的大白公鸡在我面前高视阔步着。突然，它停住了，头左右摇摆，竖起鸡冠。小路那边的草地上，来了一只小小的灰色变色龙，和公鸡一样，大清早就出来觅食。公鸡笔直扑了过去——因为小鸡吃变色龙——还一路发出满意的咯咯声。变色龙一看到公鸡，就吓得呆若木石。当此大难临头，它怕得要死，但还有些勇气，牢牢把脚插在地上，嘴张得要多大有多大，想吓跑敌人。嗖的一声，它吐出小棍状的舌头来。公鸡顿了一秒钟，仿佛吃了一惊，随即飞身扑上，毅然决然，尖尖的喙像锤子一样狠狠砸下去，把变色龙的舌头连根拔出。

两军交锋不过几秒钟就完事了。我赶开法托玛的公鸡，拿起一块大石头砸死了变色龙，因为没了舌头它也活不成；变色龙要靠舌头捕食昆虫。

这一幕把我吓得不行——这是最血腥恐怖场面的缩微版本——赶紧走远，瘫坐在我家旁边的石凳上喘口气。我坐了很久很久，法拉把我的茶端了出来，放在桌上。我低头看向石凳，不敢抬头，世界仿佛正对我露出狰狞面目。

只是，又过了好几天，很慢很慢地，我明白了：我所遭逢的可能是对我最深刻的回答。以一种特殊的方式，我得此恩召，蒙神青眼相加。我所渴望的力量在我力不从心时前来维护了我的尊严，除此之外，还能给我怎样的答案？显然不是自怜的时候，苍天如此默应我的祷告。伟大神力在嘲笑我，回音袅袅在群山间回荡，用号角般的声音在说，用公鸡和变色龙的对决在说：哈哈！

也很庆幸那天早晨我及时赶到，给了变色龙一个好死，它不必在痛苦中缓慢地咽气了。




就在这段日子——那时我还没送走马群，英格丽德·林斯东从恩乔罗过来陪我住了一段日子。这是英格丽德的一片好意，因为她自己的农场上也百事缠身，腾出时间来很不容易。为了偿付恩乔罗的地价，她的丈夫在坦噶尼喀一家大型剑麻公司找到了工作，在海拔六百米处没日没夜地挥汗如雨，就好像他是英格丽德麾下一名苦力，为了农场把他论价出租了。与此同时，她独力担起经营农场的重任；扩建家禽养殖场和菜园、养猪、培育火鸡幼崽，这已经够让她脱不开身了，哪怕几天工夫也不行。尽管如此，为了我，她把一切都交给克莫萨，风尘仆仆赶到我家，仿佛是去着火的朋友家中救火。这次她没带上克莫萨，在目前景况下，对法拉也许倒是件好事。带着坚强的力量以及某种造化产生的力量，英格丽德心底深深明白与理解我作为农场女主人不得不放弃农场、净身出户的真实滋味。

英格丽德待在我家的时候，我们既不讨论过去也不说起将来，也从不提起任何一个熟人朋友的名字，全副心神都集中在这当头祸事上。我们并肩在农场上漫步，从一处走向另一处，经过时便道出每一处的名字，一个接一个，仿佛正在为我的损失做清单，或者英格丽德将作为我的代言人，收集素材，汇总成册，对横亘于我们面前的命运提出抗议。从她自身的经验，英格丽德完全知道不可能有这么个册子，然而这种心里有数是女人生计的一部分。

我们到了牛栏，坐在栅门上，牛儿们进栏时便一一点数。我什么也没说，只是指点给英格丽德看：“这些牛。”她同样一言不发，以沉默回应：“是呀，这些牛。”把它们也列入了清单。我们去马厩给马儿们喂糖，喂完之后，我伸出沾满马的唾液、黏糊糊的手掌，把它们指给英格里德，喊了出来：“这些马。”英格丽德沉重地叹口气：“是呀，这些马。”也登记在册。在河边花园里，一想到我必须离开这些我千里迢迢从欧洲带过来的花木，她就不甘心；她在薄荷、鼠尾草和薰衣草前痛楚到直绞手，后来又几次提起它们，仿佛她正在绞尽脑汁，恨不能想出妙方能让我把它们都带上。

整个下午，我们都出神地凝望着草坪上一群非洲母牛吃草。我把它们的岁数、脾性和产奶情况一一道来，英格里丽一直呜咽着，有时还惨叫一声，仿佛身上有伤，痛得受不了。她细细地观察它们，一只接一只，不掺杂任何生意的想法，因为这些牛是要留给仆人们的，她只是在估算掂量我的损失。她靠近那些性情温柔、浑身奶香的小牛犊。她自家农场上也养了几头带犊母牛，那可是千辛万苦的一件事。明知道不合情理，甚至有违本心，她还是下意识严厉地瞥向我，用深邃的目光责备我对牛群的抛弃。

一个男人走在遭难的朋友身边，脑海里会不断地响彻一句话：“谢天谢地不是我。”我相信，他会出于愧疚尽力压制这想法。但在女友之间，情况有所不同，较幸运的一个会对另一个的灾难倾注最深的同情，与此同时，心里也会重复同一句话：“谢天谢地不是我。”这不令她们难堪气愤，相反使她们更觉亲密，寻常套话也成为肺腑之言。我觉得，男人之间很难既庆贺对方的成功又能处之淡然，不心存嫉意。但想想便知，当新娘向伴娘们炫耀幸福，临盆的产妇嫉妒带孩子的妈妈，这种场合下，谁也不会满心不舒服。经历丧子之痛的妇人会把孩子的小衣服展示给朋友们，她知道在朋友心中，一句话在反反复复：“谢天谢地不是我。”——对她们两人来说，这都是自然反应，没什么不得当的。正如英格丽德与我。当我们沿着农场漫步，我知道她在想自己的农场，为自己的好运额手称庆，毕竟，那还是她的，而且经营得井井有条，天从她愿。对这种念头我们都觉得是理所当然。虽然身穿卡其布外套和长裤，我们仍是落在凡间的谪仙，一个全身素白，另一个一身黑衣，是黑白双姝，是非洲农人生活中的魔仆。

几天后，英格丽德跟我道别，乘火车回恩乔罗了。

我无马可骑，也没有狗儿陪在我身边，出出进进变得孤零零、静悄悄的。幸好车还留着，让我很高兴，因为最后这几个月，我有好多事要做。

棚民们的命运沉甸甸地压在我心头。农场买家打算清除咖啡树，平整土地，作为宅基地出售，他们用不着棚民充当劳力，于是甫一成交，就发出通告，限棚民六个月内搬离农场。棚民们对此前所未料，大惑不解，因为他们一直以为这块地界是属于他们的。很多人祖祖辈辈就生活在这里，还有一些是很小年纪就随父母一起来的。

棚民们知道，为了能够留在这里，他们要每年为我工作一百八十天，薪水标准是每三十天十二先令，账目就保存在农场办公室里。他们也明白要付房屋税给政府，每幢十二先令，这是一笔重负，对这些除了两三幢茅草屋之外几乎一无所有的人——房屋数量取决于妻室的数目，基库尤丈夫要给每一房妻室一幢自己的棚屋。有时他们不规矩，我也威胁要把他们赶出去，所以他们也依稀有个概念：农场生涯未必能固若金汤。他们顶恨房屋税，每年我代政府在农场上征收此税项时，都有一大堆麻烦，不得不听很多废话。他们视此为人生固有的沧桑，从不放弃摆脱它的希望，千方百计试图得到豁免。对他们所有人来说，从没想过有什么根本法则是致命的，会在一定时间自行出现并摧毁一切。所以有一阵，他们把农场新东家的决定当作幻想出来的妖魔鬼怪，只要他们足够勇敢，就能视之为不存在。

在某些方面，虽然不是所有方面，但白人在原住民心目中的地位就相当于白人心目中的上帝。有一次我与一位印度木材商签订合约，内文中有一个词：“不可抗力”。我不怎么熟悉这种表达方式，为我起草合约的律师试图向我解释。

“不，不，夫人，”他说，“你还不太明白这个词的意思。这是指完全无法预见的，法规和常理都不可克服的，这就叫‘不可抗力’。”

最后，搬迁令的必然后果就是：棚民们黑压压地聚在我屋外。他们觉得自己被驱逐是我离开农场造成的——我的坏运气每日俱增，波延到他们身上。他们倒不是怪我什么，这事我们早就讲清楚了；他们只是来问：他们要去哪里。

我发现，从不止一种角度来说，这问题都无法回答。依照法律，原住民自己不得购买土地；而我也不知道附近有哪家农场够大，能装下这么多棚民。我告诉他们，我本人就此事项咨询过，得到的答复是：他们必须去基库尤人居留区找一块地。对此他们并不肯甘休，忧心忡忡地问我：在居留区能找到足够大的空地放养牛群吗？他们还问：能保证大家都在同一块地方找到位置吗？这样农场上的人就能聚在一起了，因为他们不想分开。

他们如此坚决地要住在一起，令我大为诧异，因为在农场上他们处得并不和睦，相互间没说过什么好话。但此刻，他们全在这里，神气活现、肥牛满圈的财主卡瑟古、卡尼努和莫格，与总是低声下气、羊毛也没一根的泥腿子瓦维鲁和乔萨，手拉手，心连心，脑海中只有一个共同的念头：要像保住牛羊一样保住邻居。我感到，他们并非是向我乞求一个容身之地，而是在向我讨要未来的生活。

当你从原住民手中攫取土地时，你从他们身上掠夺的远不止土地本身，而是他们的过去，他们的根，他们对自我的认同。你把他们每日所见且以为会天天见到的事物拿走了，某种意义上，等于挖去了他们的双眼。这一点在原始人身上十分明显，远超过文明人，动物总是历尽艰险，忍受折磨，要走回头路，只为了在熟悉的环境里找到失去的自我。

当年，马赛人从铁路线以北的故乡迁出，搬到现在的马赛人居留区时，连山川平原河流的名称都一起搬了过来，在新地盘用旧名字为山川平原河流命名，给旅行者带来了很大的困扰。马赛人还随身带着砍下的树根当药，在流徙生涯里，试图靠不变的生活习性，保留住他们的过去。

现在，我的棚民们出于同样的自我保护本能，紧紧地互相依附着。如果必须告别故土，身边总得有彼此认识的人，借此证明他们是谁。而在今后的若干年里，至少他们能谈谈农场的过往与地理环境，如果有人忘记，其他人可以从旁提醒。也就是说，他们意识到，被彻底灭绝的耻辱正降临到他们头上。

“去吧，姆萨布，”他们对我说，“为我们去找政府，让他们同意，搬新家的时候，我们能带上所有的牲畜，还有无论到哪里，都要住在一起。”

漫长的朝圣之路就此开始——抑或说是乞讨之路，耗尽了我在非洲的最后三个月。

奉基库尤人们的差遣，我首先去找了内罗毕和奇安布的地区长官，随后是原住民事务部和土地办公室，最后是总督大人约瑟夫·伯恩爵士，他刚刚才从英国被派来，我还不曾与他见过面。最后我已经忘了我所为何来，只是在命运的潮头里随波逐流。有时得在内罗毕待一整天，或者一天来回两三次。每次到家，总有一堆棚民聚在我屋外，但他们从不问我情况如何。靠某种原住民的魔法，他们的凝视便是传情达意，给我注入坚持忍耐的毅力。

政府官员都不厌其烦，乐于助人。这事难办，怪不得他们：在基库尤人居留区，要找到一块无遮无拦的空地，能容下所有人和牛群，真是个大问题。

大部分官员都在非洲待了很多年，对原住民了解得一清二楚。他们只会含含糊糊地建议说，上策是让基库尤人卖掉一些牲畜。但他们也知道，这方面绝无回旋余地。如果这么多牛羊生活在一块太小的土地上，一定后患无穷，将来数年，会与居留地上的邻居们引发无数争执，还得劳烦其他地区的行政官员登门拜访，交涉处理。

至于棚民们的第二个要求，也就是要待在一起，官方的人士表示：真的无此必要。

“啊！不要跟我说什么需要不需要，”我暗自思忖，“最卑贱的乞丐，也有他不值钱的身外之物。(8)”——诸如此类。终此一生，我始终是凭借想象人们在李尔王(9)面前的所作所为来区分人品优劣的。你不能与李尔王讲理，也不能同一个基库尤老人讲理，从一开始他对每个人就要得太多，但他是国王。实话实说，非洲原住民从不曾将他们的国家拱手相让，亲手交在白人手里。所以在某种意义上，情形与老国王与女儿们之间有些许不同。白人是以保护国身份掌管肯尼亚的。但有个念头在我脑海迟迟不去：就在不久前，人们还依稀记得的那段时间，原住民曾无可争辩地拥有这块土地，根本没听说过白人和白人的法规。他们的生活起伏动荡，但脚下的大地坚实不变。有些原住民被奴隶贩子掠走，在奴隶市场上出售，但还有一些一直留在这里。被带走的人身处异国他乡，是整个东方世界的奴隶，却总是回头仰望高原，因为这里是他们的家乡。拥有乌黑明眸的非洲原住民老人们与拥有乌黑明眸的老象们——何其相似。你看到他们立足大地上，沉稳而魁梧，周围的世相缓慢聚集，一点一滴在他们蒙昧未开的心灵里堆积起来。于是他们成为大地的本来象征。周遭天翻地覆，他或者它，被这巨变搅得晕晕的，也许会问你：我身在哪里。而你将用肯特(10)的话答他：“在您自己的国土上，陛下。”

到最后，我已经开始考虑是否得一辈子驱车往返于内罗毕，同政府官员无休止地会谈，却突然得到通知，说我的请求被批准了。政府划拨了一块达戈莱蒂的森林保护区给我农场上的棚民们。在那里他们可以自成村落，离旧址也不远。当农场已成往事，他们能作为社会群体共同生活，还能保留旧日的名字和名声。

消息在农场公布后，棚民们却都默然以对，不动声色。光从基库尤人的表情，几乎不可能分辨出来，他们是自始至终都坚信会有此结果，还是早就不抱希望了。此事一定，他们立刻又提出一大堆花样百出、错综复杂的要求和提议，我统统拒绝。他们仍然待在我家屋外，如常观察我的举动。原住民们对运气很敏感，也笃信命运，既然旗开得胜，他们大概开始相信万事会顺遂：我终将留在农场上。

棚民们的未来有了保障，对我自己是一个巨大的安抚。我从不曾这么心满意足过。

接着，两三天后，我意识到：在这个国度我要做的事都做完了，现在我要走了。农场里的咖啡采摘已经结束，加工厂静静矗立，我家徒四壁，棚民们下落有着。雨季过去了，草原上、山坡上的野草都长得很高了。

起先我制订的计划，是放弃所有细枝末节，只为了保住对我来说比命根还重要的农场，现在已经证实是不可行的。我一次次委屈求全，一步步割地求和，妄图赎回自己的人生。但随着时日迁移，我终于一无所有，成为最不足道的事物，命运轻而易举地就把我去除了。

那些晚上，圆月当空。月光射进空荡荡的房子，把玻璃窗的影子投在地板上。我想，也许月亮把一切尽收眼底，正在好奇在这空空如也的地方，我还打算待多久。“哦，不，”月亮回答我，“时间对我是没意义的。”

我本想多住些日子，直到亲眼看见棚民们搬进新家。但土地勘察很花时间，谁也不知道他们何时才能乔迁。

永别


就在这时，附近的老人们商量要为我举办一次传统恩贡玛，忙忙碌碌操办起来。

过去，传统恩贡玛是一桩大型盛事，现在已经很少有了，我在非洲期间从没见过一次。能参与其中，肯定很开心，因为连基库尤人自己也对此赞不绝口。老人们出席的舞会在农场举行，更被视为农场的荣光。在舞会举办之前很久，农场的人就叽叽喳喳谈个不停。

甚至法拉，一向都很看不起原住民的恩贡玛，这一次也被老人们的决心打动了。“这些人真的很老了，姆萨比，”他说，“非常非常老。”

如狮如虎般的年轻基库尤武士们谈起老年舞者们即将奉上的表演，也满是仰慕与敬畏之情。光听到他们这样说，就够新奇了。

关于传统恩贡玛，只有一件事我是被蒙在鼓里的——那就是它是被政府明文禁止的。为什么禁止，我委实不知。基库尤人对这禁令肯定清清楚楚，但他们选择性忽视了。也可能在这多灾多难的年份，一些平时不能做的事，他们觉得说不定可以通融。或许甚至，在舞会激起的满腔热情中，他们把禁令抛到了九霄云外。他们甚至没想到要为恩贡玛保密。

老年舞者们入场的画面举世罕见，可敬可佩。大约一百人同时抵达，想必是先在远处集合好了的。原住民老人最怕冷，通常用毯子和毛大衣把浑身上下裹得严严实实的，但此刻他们全部裸身以对，仿佛在庄严昭示令人生畏的真理。他们戴着灿烂饰物，身上精心涂画了战争文身，其中有几位，还像年轻舞者的惯常装束一样，在童山濯濯的脑袋瓜上戴着黑鹰羽毛制成的头饰。其实完全用不着任何装饰，他们本身就够动人了。他们并不像欧洲舞池中的迟暮美人儿们那样把自己的扮相弄得尽量年轻；相反，对他们自己和观众来说，舞会的重中之重，最吸引眼球之处，就是舞者的鲐背之年。他们在身上还画了一些奇形怪状的符号，是我从没见过的，白粉笔线条顺着他们弯弯曲曲的四肢画下去，是一种赤裸裸的诚实，仿佛是要突出地显现皮肤之下那僵硬脆弱的骨节。在大幕未拉开的前奏中，他们举步向前，步伐缓慢，实在不同寻常。我很想知道，将呈现在我面前的是什么样的舞蹈。

望着他们，一种曾经占据我身心的玄想突然重又来袭：不是我即将随风远去，我做不到，而是这片土地，正缓缓地、悲愁地在我面前撤身而去，像退潮时的大海。队列在我身边经过——事实上，这些身姿柔软的年轻舞者们是来自昨天，来自昨天的昨天，在我眼皮底下萎谢衰老，永远地逝去。他们正在以自己的方式，温柔地为我起舞，非洲人民与我同在，我与非洲人民同在，彼此两心相知。

老人们没有说话，彼此间也是如此，他们要保存体力，留到最需要的时刻。

就在舞者们排好队形准备起舞时，一个内罗毕派来的原住民士兵来了，送了一封信给我，上面写道：恩贡玛绝对不得举行。

我没明白这是怎么一回事儿，因为太出乎意料了，读了两三遍才回过神来。送信来的原住民士兵也被这盛大场面震惊，显得慌慌张张，甚至没有理会老人和我的僮仆们，这可不是他们一般的作风。平常日子，原住民士兵总要炫耀一番，摆摆架子，在同胞面前展示一下大权在握的得意扬扬。

在非洲的全部时日，我从未经历过这般辛酸的时刻。我从不知道我的心会在突如其来的风暴里恶心欲呕。我甚至说不出话来。语言的无能为力，我现在看得清清楚楚。

基库尤老人们像一群老绵羊般驯良地站着，褶皱眼皮下的眼睛都紧盯着我。他们不能在一秒钟之内放弃心头念兹在兹的事物，有些人的腿脚微微挪动了一下；他们是来跳舞的，那么他们非跳不可。最终我通知他们：恩贡玛取消了。

我知道这消息在他们脑海中激起了不同的涟漪，但究竟是什么，我无从分辨。也许他们立时明白，恩贡玛为什么取消得这么仓促干脆，谁也不能跳了，因为我已是行尸走肉，不复存在。也许他们会觉得，事实上已经跳过了，一次无与伦比的恩贡玛，如此华丽盛大，令万事万物化为乌有。而恩贡玛结束后，一切就都结束了。

万籁俱寂里，草地上一只非洲小狗抓紧时间大声叫了起来，狗吠声的回响在我脑海中回荡：

“……这些小狗：脱雷、勃尔趋、史威塔，瞧，它们都在向我狂吠。”(1)

卡曼特是负责在舞会散场后向老人们发放鼻烟的。他虽然不爱说话，但其实很擅长随机应变，一见此情，马上想到这是发放鼻烟的好时候，就捧着装满鼻烟的大葫芦出来了。法拉向他挥手，示意让他退后，但卡曼特是基库尤人，很了解这些老年舞者，有他的一套办法。鼻烟是实打实的东西，我们给老人们分发。过了一会儿，他们就全都走光了。




农场上最舍不得我走的，我觉得是老妇人们。基库尤老妇人们一辈子饱尝艰辛，在苦难的折磨下，变得燧石一般坚强，老骡子一般怪僻，逮着机会就咬你一口。我在行医生涯中意识到：任何能令男人致死的疾病，想征服她们可难上加难。她们比男人更粗野，也从不羡慕别人，这方面和男人相比，是有过之而无不及。她们生了一堆小孩，眼睁睁看着其中很多死去；她们对人生无所畏惧。她们扛着柴火——头顶上系一根绳子以固定柴束——被近三百斤重的柴火压得步履蹒跚，却从不会停下脚步；在土质坚硬的自留地里，她们苦苦劳作，腰从大清早到深更半夜都直不起来。“从那里窥看食物，眼睛远远观望。她的心结实如石头，如下磨石那样结实。她嗤笑可怕的事。她几时挺身展开翅膀，就嗤笑马和骑马的人。她岂向你连连恳求，说柔和的话吗？”(2)在她们身上，仍蕴藏着丰富的生命，活力四射。老妇人们对农场上发生的事，件件都有兴趣，会步行三十里地，只为了参加年轻人的恩贡玛。一个笑话，一杯特步酒，都能让她们牙都没了、满是皱纹的脸乐开了花。这种力量，这种她们对生活的酷爱，令我不仅肃然起敬，而且深以为荣，很受鼓舞。

农场上的老妇人与我一向都是朋友，叫我“杰里”的就是她们。男人和孩子——除非特别特别小——从不这样称呼我。杰里是个基库尤女性名字，但意思特殊——如果一个基库尤女孩，比兄姐都小很多很多岁，就称之为“杰里”，我猜这名字里面有怜爱的意味。

老妇人们一想起我要走了，就心里难过。在这段最后的日子里，我永远记住了一位基库尤妇人的形象，我不知道她的名字，也对她所知甚少，我估计，她是卡瑟古村子里的，是他一大群儿媳妇中的一个。我们是在原野里一条小道上遇见的。她背着一捆长长的细竹竿，是基库尤人铺房顶用的——而这个是妇女的活计。竹竿长约四五米，上身时，竹竿末端会捆紧，压在人背上，就形成了一个长圆锥形。当你隔着遥遥的草原，看到这形象在天际踽踽而行，像史前动物或者长颈鹿的剪影。这个妇人身上背的竹竿都是焦黑颜色，想必是多年来棚屋里烟熏火燎的结果。这就意味着她刚刚拆掉了房子，拖着这些建筑材料，去新址建造房屋。当我们迎面相遇，她站住了，一动也不动，挡住了我身前的路，直勾勾看我的样子，和鹿群里的长颈鹿一模一样——当你在辽阔的平原上碰到它们，它们的生命、感情与所思所想，都是我们所未知的。过了一会儿，她突然失声痛哭，泪水沿着她的面颊倾泻下来，就像原野里的一头母牛当着你面在尿尿。我们两人都一言不发，几分钟后，她为我让出路来，我们继续各走各路，沿着相反的方向越行越远。我想，不管怎么说，她好歹有材料能用来盖新家，我想象她开始劳作的样子，把竹竿捆扎好，为自己搭一个屋顶。

农场上的小放牛娃们从呱呱坠地起，就不知道还有我不住在这里的时候，所以我即将远行的消息反而让他们觉得很刺激，有一种悬而未决的紧张感。想象没有我的世界，对他们来说也许很难，也属于斗胆包天，就好像众所周知的老天爷即将退位。当我经过时，他们会突然从高高的野草丛中站起来，对我大喊道：“什么时候走，姆萨布？姆萨布，还有多少天你就走了？”




最终，永别的日子还是到了。我有了一种奇特的体会：事情总会发生，却非我们想象的样子，无论是事前的预测、事中的观察，抑或事后的回想。形势比人强，自有其博大的能动力量，促使事件发生，全不理会我们的设想或者忧惧。当此情势，你得时时刻刻聚精会神跟上事物的变化，就像一个被牵着走的盲人，小心翼翼地挪着脚步，对自己走的路线却一无所知。事儿你摊上了，你意识到它的发生，但除此之外，你与这些事没有接触，对它的因果或意义都摸不着头脑。我觉得，马戏团里的野生动物按照编排好的节目上台表演，也不过如此。历经这般劫难的人，某种意义上可以说，是死过一次——死亡是想象国度门外的回廊，却在经验的国度内。

古斯塔夫·摩尔一大清早就开车过来，为了送我去车站。那是个冷飕飕的早晨，空气和风景都惨淡无光。他脸色苍白，直眨眼。我想起在德班(3)遇见的一位挪威的捕鲸船老船长，他曾说过，挪威人在任何狂风暴雨里都绝不气馁，但他们的神经系统就是忍受不了安静无聊。我们坐在磨石桌前喝茶，就像之前的很多次一样。抬头向西，群山在我们面前，一片灰灰蒙蒙的薄雾笼罩在溪流上，平静如斯，在它们数千年的峥嵘岁月里，这不过是又一个弹指瞬间。我很冷，感觉像坐在山顶上。

仆人们还待在空房子里，但可以这么说，他们已经不在这里过日子了，家人和财产都先运走了。法拉家的女人们和儿子索非在前一天就已经乘坐货车去了内罗毕的一个索马里村庄。法拉本人将护送我到蒙巴萨，同行的还有朱玛的小儿子托姆波，因为他特别想去，天下什么好东西都比不上这个。作为临别礼物，我们让他二选一，要么是一头牛，要么一趟蒙巴萨之旅。他选了旅行。

我对每个仆人都说了再见，事先仔细叮嘱过，在我走后要关好门窗，但当我上路后，门在我身后大开着。这是典型的原住民做法，仿佛是想说我还会回来，也可能是强调屋子里空无一物，不值得关门，不如门户大开，让风雨来去自由。法拉驾驶车辆，他开得很慢，我猜骑骆驼也就是这个速度吧，车道转了弯，房子从视野里消失了。

到了池塘边，我问摩尔，时间够不够在这里待一会儿。我们下了车，在水坝旁抽了支烟。我看见水里有鱼，现在那些抓鱼吃鱼的人根本不认识老努森，也不会明白这些鱼的重要性。斯朗加，棚民卡尼努患癫痫的小外孙，赶到这里，对我说了最后一声“再见”。在这最后的日子里，他在房子里进进出出，不停地说了又说。我们上车后，车又发动了，他在车后死命追，他是如此瘦小，仿佛是被风裹挟在尘土里——像从我生命之火上爆裂出来的最后一颗小火星。他跑呀跑，一直跑到农场道路与公路相接的路口处，我很担心他会一直追上公路；就仿佛农场已经四分五裂，谷糠般全随风四散。但他在转角处站住了，毕竟他还是属于农场的。他一动不动，眼光追着我们的身影，直到我再也看不到农场道路的那个路口。

去内罗毕的路上，我们看到了大量蝗虫待在草丛中，停在路上，有几只还嗡嗡地钻进了车里，看上去它们将卷土重来，又一次要祸害乡间了。

许多朋友等在车站为我送行。休·马丁来了，身形胖大，不以为意，过来跟我说再见。这时我看到了我的农场医生潘乐思，遗世独立，一副英雄气概，他倾尽所有换来这份孤单，某种意义上，他就是非洲的象征。我们友好地道别。过去我们曾共度许多欢乐时光，聊过很多有深度的话题。我上次见到德拉米尔勋爵，还是一战初期，我带牛车运输队经过马赛人居留区，与他喝过一杯茶。现在他比当时老了一些，头发已经花白，也剪短了，但一如既往地风度翩翩，礼数周全，风范无与伦比。许多内罗毕的索马里人都在站台上。老牲畜商人阿卜杜拉走过来，送我一枚嵌有绿松石的银戒指，愿它给我带来好运。丹尼斯的仆人比利阿郑重地托我转达他向主人在英国的兄长的敬意，他曾在后者家中住过。上火车的路上，法拉告诉我，索马里女人们也乘人力车到了车站准备为我送行，但看到这么多索马里男人聚在这里，她们失去了勇气，怏怏而返。

我上车后，与古斯塔夫·摩尔握手。火车即将启动，已经启动了，他才终于恢复了平静。他那么渴望赋予我勇气，脸都涨得通红，面颊上像有一团火在烧，目光炯炯地望着我。




在桑布鲁站，车停了。趁火车加水的工夫，我走出车厢，与法拉一道在站台上溜达。

从这里远望西南，我看到了恩贡山。在蔚蓝晴空的掩映下，壮丽山峦拔地而起，周围是一马平川的高原。离得太远了，四座主峰显得虚无缥缈，几不可辨，和我在农场远眺时的样子全然不同。我们越行越远，距离之手慢慢抚平了山峰的曲线，令它渐渐与大地合而为一。

假如你还想知道更多（代译后记）


朋友：

1913年，正是在伯克利·科尔的提议下——他厌倦了无聊平庸的殖民地生活，声称：“不想再像只猪猡般被对待，渴望摇个铃，便有人端上无瑕精致茶具的文明生活。”——在众多英国贵族的鼎力支持下，在内罗毕郊区选址，勘测人员、建筑师、设计师纷纷从欧洲赶来。1914年新年夜，穆海迦俱乐部正式开始营业，成为东非最奢华的社交场合和白人天堂。

科尔家族的一位朋友说伯克利是同性恋，但其家人不接受此说法。亦传说他有一位马赛族情妇。公开出版物中对他叙说不详。他在涅里附近有一家农场，肯尼亚出生的女作家艾丝佩丝·赫胥黎（1906—1997）曾写过他在穆海迦俱乐部的一些存心搞笑的举动，但未提及他的个人生活。他参加过英国与南非之间的布尔战争，一战期间曾加入东非骑兵部队。

凯伦的《非洲来信》里，直到赴肯十年后的1923年，才第一次提到伯克利·科尔。那年他和芬奇-哈顿几次同来，有时也一个人来。她在信里写道：“伯克利是一个顶开心的人，非常活泼有趣，别出心裁……他很喜欢聊天，作为立法委员，他对肯尼亚政治很关心；他是马赛人的老朋友，索马里人的保护神……”在1924年八月，她说和伯克利结婚的可能性对她没什么吸引力。不清楚为什么她想到这个——但她说过，她宁愿结婚而不想孤身一人。他在1925年初死于心脏病，可能是他年轻时患上的风湿热引起的炎症和伤疤，使心脏瓣膜和心肌受损，造成了风湿性心脏病。

情人：

丹尼斯·芬奇-哈顿（1887—1931），父亲是温切尔西公爵，母亲是海军上将的女儿。他在林肯郡自家的庄园里长大。他是第三个孩子，有一兄一姐，是母亲最偏爱的孩子，也是每个人的宠儿。尤其在伊顿公学期间，因他的幽默感和聪明伶俐，交了很多朋友。他在唱歌、画画、戏仿、诗歌、讲故事等方面都很出色，而在板球、足球和高尔夫上更是优秀，牛津期间，赢得三次参加高尔夫校队的荣誉，最后一年还与剑桥大学比赛。不过，他学业一般，在牛津毕业时只是区区四等。在大学期间，作为一个玩笑，他剃了光头，据说从此头发再也没有长回来。1927年他40岁时，狩猎途中所拍摄的照片里，他已秃顶。不过他仍然相貌英俊，丰满的嘴唇是贵族血统的明证。他身高187厘米，与母亲很相像，白肤蓝眼，微带草莓红的金发。

1911年，24岁的丹尼斯与几位亲戚去南非短暂旅行后，带着一位已故叔叔留给他的遗产去了肯尼亚。他在东非大裂谷东侧购置了一些土地，靠近现在的埃尔多富特市。他没有亲自经营农场，只是把农场交给了合伙人，时间全用在了狩猎上。之后他的生活模式便是在英国度春夏，在非洲过秋冬。

丹尼斯的兄长娶了一个美国银行家的女儿。而丹尼斯直到31岁遇到长他两岁的凯伦·布里克森之前，从无恋情。1918年四月，他们在穆海迦俱乐部相识。那之前，丹尼斯一直在埃及军中服务，曾打算学习飞行，但一次脚伤令此计划告吹。

一战结束后，他成为凯伦夫妇俩的朋友。他朋友甚多，但在1920年，因经济原因，他离开非洲两年之久，并且卖掉了非洲农场。

1922年，他返回非洲，投资了一家土地开发公司。当时凯伦已与丈夫分居，两人交往渐渐频繁。起先，他不去狩猎时便住在泰考格的一幢小别墅里。但1925年，凯伦离婚后，他搬到了凯伦家里。

1925年，丹尼斯开始专业从事狩猎，为富有的冒险家们提供向导服务。他的客户名单里有：芝加哥百货业大亨的孙子马歇尔·弗烈德三世，美国自动售货机大亨的孙子弗雷德里克·B．帕特森。威尔士亲王（后来的温莎公爵）也在此名单中。

从战争年代起，他便与西奥多·罗斯福总统的儿子克米特相识，交情很好，但他从没去过美国。他到过相邻的几个国家：坦桑尼亚、索马里兰、埃塞俄比亚——但不包括印度或远东。

1926年，凯伦怀孕后，丹尼斯写信给她：“我理应通力合作，但我做不到。”他似乎不想与任何人结婚。在殖民地，有他是同性恋或双性恋的传言。

有历史学家认为，他属于对生儿育女没有兴趣的一代人。这种态度是对维多利亚时代风格的逆反，是对家庭生活和责任感的坚决拒斥，孤绝的大英雄形象是那个时代的潮流，福尔摩斯、神探波洛和马普尔小姐全部不婚不育，离群索居，平庸的华生之流才需要婚姻。

终其一生，丹尼斯对妻子、婚姻、职责或者声名，抑或子孙后代，全满不在乎。“他一生一事无成却无所不为。”

凯伦曾说他是一个没有目标的人，称他为“做梦人”。

丹尼斯在1929年上了飞行课程，1930年夏天购买了一架蛾式飞机。在英国时，他撞上兄长庄园里的几棵树，机身轻微毁坏。他修复飞机后，靠远洋轮把飞机运到了非洲。后来他带包括凯伦在内的许多朋友上天飞行过，他曾向女飞行家柏瑞尔·马卡姆建议从空中搜寻大象的踪迹，后者真的这么做了。

1931年五月，丹尼斯在他邻近蒙巴萨的滨海小别墅住了几天后，飞往沃伊准备从空中搜索大象，随身带了自己的索马里仆人哈米斯。

次日从沃伊起飞后，飞机意外坠毁。机内二人全部身亡。凯伦·布里克森操办了他的后事，把他安葬于恩贡山间。他坟上的方尖碑耸立至今，已成为肯尼亚著名旅游景点。

1929年刚开始驾驶飞机时，丹尼斯便立了遗嘱。内容如下：将枪支和所有狩猎用具遗赠给兄长托比，其他遗产由姐姐托普西继承。如果她在丹尼斯之前去世，则她的儿女安娜和米歇尔每人获得四千镑，剩余遗产由托比继承。遗嘱中没有提到凯伦。

他在蒙巴萨附近的那片土地现为私人产业。那幢小别墅已经拆除，任何痕迹都不曾留下。

丹尼斯之后，凯伦再没有恋爱过，直到去世。

前夫：

布洛尔·布里克森（1887—1946），身高180厘米，浅蓝色眼睛，脸颊饱满。好大谈特谈、喋喋不休。喜饮酒，好交游。

凯伦确实是为了男爵夫人的头衔才和布洛尔结婚的。但她在婚姻中（分居前）始终对丈夫是尽心尽力的。在她的故事《珍珠》（《冬天的故事》）里面，她曾经半自辩半自嘲地写道：“哥本哈根的闲言碎语都说，新郎是娶了钱，新娘是嫁给名，但他们全错了。这一对是相爱的佳偶……”

布洛尔上的是农业学校，但从来没认真对待这回事儿，毕业后管理过家族的牛奶场。亲戚向他们推荐在非洲兴建农场，以为是学以致用，但他的兴趣全在追猎动物和女人上。

1914年，布洛尔先期到达非洲，发现农场面临的最大问题是募集工人。布洛尔的第一个任务便是去拜访吉南朱伊大酋长，赠送大量礼物，谈判几个星期后，吉南朱伊终于向他担保，会有几百名武士放下长矛，去拿他的薪水。种植期为雨季二月到六月。布洛尔告诉凯伦他的打算：他将为这些非洲人留出土地盖棚屋，放养牲畜，提供食物和毛毯，并按原住民劳工条例规定，每个月付几卢比的薪水。每位在种植期后还留下来的原住民劳工，将得到0.8公顷的自留地，自留地的出产全归劳工本人所有，条件是劳工至少要每年为农场工作一百八十天，允许甚至鼓励劳工带家人到农场上。他认为让棚民们住在农场上比较好，这样就能知道自己有多少工人，心里有个数。许多白人农场主难以留住工人，但布洛尔觉得，只要善待非洲人，他们就会留下来。当时在殖民地，任何农场主要关注的都是保证工人的健康，棚民们的妻子要养成每日检查病痛和意外伤害的习惯。所以他要求凯伦尽可能满足非洲人的医药需求，如果她对药膏和绷带茫然无措，那么，她怎么照顾自己，就怎么照顾这些非洲人。正是因此，她离开丹麦时，布洛尔要她带上医药箱。另外，至少布洛尔本人略懂一点急救常识，万一有什么对付不了的，他们离传教团医院也只有二十千米。

他们新婚不久，布洛尔就志愿报名参加一种传递情报的“非战组织”，在基加贝与前线之间来回。凯伦也自愿去基加贝车站做情报工作，为了能够在布洛尔到达基加贝的时候照顾布洛尔——很不幸，据传记作家考证，多半是在这期间，布洛尔把梅毒传给了她。

婚姻的裂痕应该从最开始就存在。凯伦曾抱怨说布洛尔去一次法国，就能负债两万克朗，都是为了给女人们买礼物。布洛尔的家人信件中也指出：1920年，他离开东非期间，与孪生哥哥汉斯的遗孀有过一段私情。

1919年，布洛尔提出离婚。1921年，咖啡公司的总经理、凯伦的奥格舅舅罢免了布洛尔的职位，凯伦接管农场。同年，他们正式分居；1925年，离婚生效。

布洛尔和丹尼斯一样迷恋狩猎，在1928年威尔士亲王访肯期间，他和丹尼斯都是带领亲王狩猎的接待人。他的客户名单里还包括海明威，其短篇小说《弗朗西斯·麦康伯短促的幸福生活》中猎人罗伯特·威尔逊的形象，便是以他和另一位向导的形象糅合而成。

1934年，他携自己后来的第三任妻子伊娃·狄克逊，去正在巴哈马群岛的比米尼群岛附近海面出海的海明威船上做客。海明威交给他《非洲的青山》原稿副本，请他认真阅读，帮忙校订资料。

1936年，他与伊娃结合。伊娃是一位瑞典女子，有敢作敢为的名声，从第一任丈夫那里学会了赛车，1938年在印度死于车祸。

自离婚后，凯伦与布洛尔从未碰过面。在她写于丹麦期间的书信（后结集为《丹麦来信》）里，关于布洛尔，她写了些很不好听的话。

1934年八月，在写给古斯塔夫·摩尔的信中，她说：“我一想起布洛尔——他呀，我得说，真是少见，简直不可能想出比他还不要脸的人。”

1946年四月，布洛尔死于车祸，之后凯伦在给亲戚的信中写道：“布洛尔的死讯比我能想到的还让我感伤……我想起他就难过；他特别有潜力，几乎可以说是天才，就像布里克森家所有的人一样，但他性格中有弱点，倒不是大毛病，却让我没法和他好好相处，他每天到处撒小谎：向我的非洲工人们借钱，哄他们说我会还钱给他们……我什么东西他都拿去抵押，他拉我签商业合同，事先藏起了里面的一两个小条款，结果最终毁了我们的所有努力。”

至死，凯伦一直要求身边人称自己为“男爵夫人”。

初恋：

因为是亲戚，凯伦从小就认识这对双胞胎表弟，彼此嬉笑玩耍。当寻求婚姻的可能性时，她选择了汉斯·布里克森。汉斯是哥哥，大几分钟，更英俊一些，是军官、赛马手和天才的运动员，或许制服对女孩子来说确实更有吸引力吧。

她痴迷了若干年，所有家人都知道，表妹兼最好的女友黛茜还鼓励她，但最终未果。她与布洛尔结合。

1917年，汉斯因私人飞机坠毁身亡（据悉，是从一个赛马场飞往另一个赛马场的途中），身后只留下一个儿子，也叫汉斯。小汉斯写过几本驯马的书，还在1952年获得过奥运会马术三日赛项目的金牌。

布洛尔与汉斯感情至好，布洛尔曾在给父母的信中说：“汉斯不仅是我的孪生哥哥，也是我唯一的、最好的朋友。我们心心相印，无所不谈。失去他，就好像失去了部分的我。”

兄弟姐妹：

凯伦共有五兄弟姐妹，她排行第二，上有一姐。姐妹都嫁到富裕人家，大她两岁的姐姐在她37岁那年因病逝世，留下一个女儿；小她一岁的妹妹艾伦嫁了一个出版商兼律师，无子嗣但伉俪情深，艾伦曾在信中说自己的生活完全围着丈夫转。

凯伦的第一本书《七个哥特式故事》便是交由妹夫的公司出版，但要从英文翻译成丹麦文时，双方意见不合，最后凯伦只好亲自翻译了。后来，妹夫公司打算出版布洛尔的回忆录，激怒了凯伦。直到最后对方放弃出版计划，姐妹关系才缓和，但来往还是疏远了。

艾伦也是一位作家，但没有坚持写作。她对家族的最大贡献是，她买下了从事工程师工作的弟弟托马斯的遗产份额，捐献给隆斯特德仑基金会，避免了财产纷争，凯伦的房子也得以永远留给家族的后代子孙。

总管：

凯伦离开非洲后，法拉曾为好些人工作过，其中也包括布洛尔。1940年至1942年期间，他为东北地区的托马斯少校开车。

一天与朋友在餐馆吃饭后，他因食物中毒而死。他生于1885年，卒于1942年，但具体生卒日期不详。

他最小的两个女儿莎布拉和阿莎亚丁现定居在加拿大渥太华。

仆人：

卡曼特一直记得在凯伦的夜校里学会的寓言，他曾经在墙上画画的天赋已经变成了一幅幅美丽的水彩画。

在与传记作家的访谈中，他说：“我，卡曼特·盖特拉，是她家中的厨师。在与凯伦夫人共同生活的时期，我确实去过内罗毕，作为穆海迦俱乐部的选手，与那些最好的厨师——来自诺福克酒店、斯坦利酒店、修道士酒店的，还有一家叫皇后酒店的——比赛。沿着恩贡公路走，两边有很多房子，就像现在一样。我们睡在内罗毕，凯伦夫人有很多热情的朋友。”

“第一个找到布里克森男爵和夫人要自留地的正好是我父亲。他先去找了吉南朱伊，他说我们应该去一块新开出来的地。我们去的正好是凯伦夫人的地。从原来的恩加凯农场过去，走了好远的路。就这样。”

凯伦的墓地：

人人都记得，在《走出非洲》中，凯伦连连提到埋骨于非洲，希望埋在丹尼斯身边。但事实上，她的墓地在丹麦隆斯特德仑庄园埃瓦尔德山脚下，位于一片开阔的山毛榉林中。

文学之外的真相是——或者说是某些传记作家理解的真相：她从非洲返回丹麦时，觉得是一种解脱，她所爱恋的非洲并非真实的非洲，而是一种象征，一片新的大地，一曲田园牧歌，而她单枪匹马，以弱女子的大英雄形象，救原住民于水火。真实的非洲，她不愿想及也不愿看到，那只是失落的理想国，是永远不能重返的伊甸园。

她在丹麦的余生很安详，从不曾要求葬于非洲。

“From the forests and highlands

we come，we come．”





The Ngong Farm


I had a farm in Africa，at the foot of the Ngong Hills．The Equator runs across these highlands，a hundred miles to the north，and the farm lay at an altitude of over six thousand feet．In the day-time you felt that you had got high up，near to the sun，but the early mornings and evenings were limpid and restful，and the nights were cold．

The geographical position，and the height of the land combined to create a landscape that had not its like in all the world．There was no fat on it and no luxuriance anywhere；it was Africa distilled up through six thousand feet，like the strong and refined essence of a continent．The colours were dry and burnt，like the colours in pottery．The trees had a light delicate foliage，the structure of which was different from that of the trees in Europe；it did not grow in bows or cupolas，but in horizontal layers，and the formation gave to the tall solitary trees a likeness to the palms，or a heroic and romantic air like fullrigged ships with their sails furled，and to the edge of a wood a strange appearance as if the whole wood were faintly vibrating．Upon the grass of the great plains the crooked bare old thorn-trees were scattered，and the grass was spiced like thyme and bog-myrtle；in some places the scent was so strong that it smarted in the nostrils．All the flowers that you found on the plains，or upon the creepers and liana in the native forest，were diminutive like flowers of the downs—only just in the beginning of the long rains a number of big，massive heavy-scented lilies sprang out on the plains．The views were immensely wide．Everything that you saw made for greatness and freedom，and unequalled nobility．

The chief feature of the landscape，and of your life in it，was the air．Looking back on a sojourn in the African highlands，you are struck by your feeling of having lived for a time up in the air．The sky was rarely more than pale blue or violet，with a profusion of mighty，weightless，ever-changing clouds towering up and sailing on it，but it has a blue vigour in it，and at a short distance it painted the ranges of hills and the woods a fresh deep blue．In the middle of the day the air was alive over the land，like a flame burning；it scintillated，waved and shone like running water，mirrored and doubled all objects，and created great Fata Morgana．Up in this high air you breathed easily，drawing in a vital assurance and lightness of heart．In the highlands you woke up in the morning and thought：Here I am，where I ought to be．




The Mountain of Ngong stretches in a long ridge from north to south，and is crowned with four noble peaks like immovable darker blue waves against the sky．It rises eight thousand feet above the sea，and to the East two thousand feet above the surrounding country；but to the west the drop is deeper and more precipitous—the hills fall vertically down towards the Great Rift Valley．

The wind in the highlands blows steadily from the north-north-east．It is the same wind that，down at the coasts of Africa and Arabia，they name the Monsoon，the East Wind，which was King Solomon's favourite horse．Up here it is felt as just the resistance of the air，as the earth throws herself forward into space．The wind runs straight against the Ngong Hills，and the slopes of the hills would be the ideal place for setting up a glider，that would be lifted upwards by the currents，over the mountain top．The clouds，which were travelling with the wind，struck the side of the hill and hung round it，or were caught on the summit and broke into rain．But those that took a higher course and sailed clear of the reef，dissolved to the west of it，over the burning desert of the Rift Valley．Many times I have from my house followed these mighty processions advancing，and have wondered to see their proud floating masses，as soon as they had got over the hills，vanish in the blue air and be gone．

The hills from the farm changed their character many times in the course of the day，and sometimes looked quite close，and at other times very far away．In the evening，when it was getting dark，it would first look，as you gazed at them，as if in the sky a thin silver line was drawn all along the silhouette of the dark mountain；then，as night fell，the four peaks seemed to be flattened and smoothened out，as if the mountain was stretching and spreading itself．

From the Ngong Hills you have a unique view，you see to the south the vast plains of the great game-country that stretches all the way to Kilimanjaro；to the east and north the park-like country of the foot hills with the forest behind them，and the undulating land of the Kikuyu Reserve，which extends to Mount Kenya a hundred miles away—a mosaic of little square maize fields，banana-groves and grassland，with here and there the blue smoke from a native village，a small cluster of peaked mole-casts．But towards the west，deep down，lies the dry，moon-like landscape of the African low country．The brown desert is irregularly dotted with the little marks of the thornbushes，the winding river-beds are drawn up with crooked dark-green trails；those are the woods of the mighty，wide-branching mimosa trees，with thorns like spikes；the cactus grows here，and here is the home of the giraffe and the rhino．

The hill-country itself，when you get into it，is tremendously big，picturesque and mysterious；varied with long valleys，thickets，green slopes and rocky crags．High up，under one of the peaks，there is even a bamboo-grove．There are springs and wells in the hills；I have camped up here by them．

In my day，the buffalo，the eland and the rhino lived in the Ngong Hills；the very old Natives remembered a time when there were elephants there，and I was always sorry that the whole Ngong Mountain was not enclosed in the Game Reserve．Only a small part of it was Game Reserve，and the beacon on the southern peak marked the boundary of it．When the colony prospers and Nairobi，the capital，grows into a big city，the Ngong Hills might have made a matchless game park for it．But during my last years in Africa many young Nairobi shop-people ran out into the hills on Sundays，on their motor-cycles，and shot at anything they saw，and I believe that the big game will have wandered away from the hills，through the thorn-thickets and the stony ground farther south．

Up on the very ridge of the hills and on the four peaks themselves it was easy to walk；the grass was short as on a lawn，with the grey stone in places breaking through the sward．Along the ridge，up and down the peaks，like a gentle switchback，there ran a narrow game-path．One morning，at the time that I was camped in the hills，I came up here and walked along the path，and I found on it fresh tracks and dung of a herd of eland．The big peaceful animals must have been up on the ridge at sunrise，walking in a long row，and you cannot imagine that they had come for any other reason than just to look，deep down on both sides，at the land below．




We grew coffee on my farm．The land was in itself a little too high for coffee，and it was hard work to keep it going；we were never rich on the farm．But a coffee-plantation is a thing that gets hold of you and does not let you go，and there is always something to do on it：you are generally just a little behind with your work．

In the wildness and irregularity of the country，a piece of land laid out and planted according to rule looked very well．Later on，when I flew in Africa，and became familiar with the appearance of my farm from the air，I was filled with admiration for my coffee-plantation，that lay quite bright green in the grey-green land，and I realized how keenly the human mind yearns for geometrical figures．All the country round Nairobi，particularly to the north of the town，is laid out in a similar way，and here live a people，who are constantly thinking and talking of planting，pruning，or picking coffee，and who lie at night and meditate upon improvements to their coffee-factories．

Coffee-growing is a long job．It does not all come out as you imagine，when，yourself young and hopeful，in the streaming rain，you carry the boxes of your shining young coffee-plants from the nurseries，and，with the whole number of farm-hands in the field，watch the plants set in the regular rows of holes in the wet ground where they are to grow，and then have them thickly shaded against the sun，with branches broken from the bush，since obscurity is the privilege of young things．It is four or five years till the trees come into bearing，and in the meantime you will get drought on the land，or diseases，and the bold native weeds will grow up thick in the fields—the black-jack，which has long scabrous seed-vessels that hang on to your clothes and stockings．Some of the trees have been badly planted with their tap-roots bent；they will die just as they begin to flower．You plant a little over six hundred trees to the acre，and I had six hundred acres of land with coffee；my oxen dragged the cultivators up and down the fields，between the rows of trees，many thousand miles，patiently，awaiting coming bounties．

There are times of great beauty on a coffee-farm．When the plantation flowered in the beginning of the rains，it was a radiant sight，like a cloud of chalk，in the mist and the drizzling rain，over six hundred acres of land．The coffee-blossom has a delicate slightly bitter scent，like the blackthorn blossom．When the field reddened with the ripe berries，all the women and the children，whom they call the Totos，were called out to pick the coffee off the trees，together with the men；then the wagons and carts brought it down to the factory near the river．Our machinery was never quite what it should have been，but we had planned and built the factory ourselves and thought highly of it．Once the whole factory burned down and had to be built up again．The big coffee-dryer turned and turned，rumbling the coffee in its iron belly with a sound like pebbles that are washed about on the sea-shore．Sometimes the coffee would be dry，and ready to take out of the dryer，in the middle of the night．That was a picturesque moment，with many hurricane lamps in the huge dark room of the factory，that was hung everywhere with cobwebs and coffee-husks，and with eager glowing dark faces，in the light of the lamps，round the dryer；the factory，you felt，hung in the great African night like a bright jewel in an Ethiop's ear．Later on the coffee was hulled，graded，and sorted by hand，and packed in sacks sewn up with a saddler's needle．

Then，in the end，in the early morning，while it was still dark，and I was lying in bed，I heard the wagons，loaded high up with coffee-sacks，twelve to a ton，with sixteen oxen to each wagon，starting on their way into Nairobi railway station up the long factory hill，with much shouting and rattling，the drivers running beside the wagons．I was pleased to think that this was the only hill up，on their way，for the farm was a thousand feet higher than the town of Nairobi．In the evening I walked out to meet the procession that came back，the tired oxen hanging their heads in front of the empty wagons，with a tired little Toto leading them，and the weary drivers trailing their whips in the dust of the road．Now we had done what we could do．The coffee would be on the sea in a day or two，and we could only hope for good luck at the big auction-sales in London．

I had six thousand acres of land，and had thus got much spare land besides the coffee-plantation．Part of the farm was native forest，and about one thousand acres were squatters' land，what they called their shambas．The squatters are Natives，who with their families hold a few acres on a white man's farm，and in return have to work for him a certain number of days in the year．My squatters，I think，saw the relationship in a different light，for many of them were born on the farm，and their fathers before them，and they very likely regarded me as a sort of superior squatter on their estates．The squatters' land was more intensely alive than the rest of the farm，and was changing with the seasons the year round．The maize grew up higher than your head as you walked on the narrow hard-trampled footpaths in between the tall green rustling regiments，and then again it was harvested．The beans ripened in the fields，were gathered and thrashed by the women，and the stalks and pods were collected and burned，so that in certain seasons thin blue columns of smoke rose here and there all over the farm．The Kikuyu also grew the sweet potatoes，that have a vine-like leaf and spread over the ground like a dense entangled mat，and many varieties of big yellow and green speckled pumpkins．

Whenever you walk amidst the Kikuyu shambas，the first thing that will catch your eye is the hind part of a little old woman raking in her soil，like a picture of an ostrich which buries her head in the sand．Each Kikuyu family had a number of small round peaked huts and store-huts；the space between the huts was a lively place，the earth hard as concrete；here the maize was ground and the goats milked，and children and chickens were running．I used to shoot spurfowl in the sweet-potato fields round the squatters' houses in the blue late afternoons，and the stock-pigeons cooed out a loud song in the high-stemmed，fringy trees，which were left over，here and there in the shambas，from the forest that had once covered all the farm．

I had moreover a couple of thousand acres of grassland on the farm．Here the long grass ran and fled like sea-waves before the strong wind，and the little Kikuyu herdboys herded their fathers' cows．In the cold season they carried live coals in small wicker baskets with them from the huts，and sometimes caused big grass-fires，which were disastrous to the grazing on the farm．In the years of drought the zebra and the eland came down to the farm's grass-plains．




Nairobi was our town，twelve miles away，down on a flat bit of land amongst hills．Here were the Government House and the big central offices；from here the country was ruled．

It is impossible that a town will not play a part in your life，it does not even make much difference whether you have more good or bad things to say of it，it draws your mind to it，by a mental law of gravitation．The luminous haze on the sky above the town at night，which I could see from some places on my farm，set my thoughts going，and recalled the big cities of Europe．

When I first came to Africa，there were no cars in the country，and we rode in to Nairobi，or drove in a cart with six mules to it，and stabled our animals in the stables of The Highland Transport．During all my time，Nairobi was a medley place，with some fine new stone buildings，and whole quarters of old corrugated iron shops，offices and bungalows，laid out with long rows of eucalyptus trees along the bare dusty streets．The offices of the High Court，the Native Affairs Department，and the Veterinary Department were lousily housed，and I had a great respect for those government officials who could get any work at all done in the little burning hot，inky rooms in which they were set．

All the same Nairobi was a town；here you could buy things，hear news，lunch or dine at the hotels and dance at the Club．And it was a live place，in movement like running water，and in growth like a young thing，it changed from year to year，and while you were away on a shooting safari．The new Government House was built，a stately cool house with a fine ball-room and a pretty garden，big hotels grew up，great impressive agricultural shows and fine flower shows were held，our Quasi Smart Set of the Colony from time to time enlivened the town with rows of quick melodrama．Nairobi said to you：“Make the most of me and of time．Wir kommen nie wieder so jung—so undisciplined and rapacious—zusammen．”Generally I and Nairobi were in very good understanding，and at one time I drove through the town and thought：There is no world without Nairobi's streets．

The quarters of the Natives and of the coloured immigrants were very extensive compared to the European town．

The Swaheli town，on the road to the Muthaiga Club，had not a good name in any way，but was a lively，dirty and gaudy place，with，at any hour，a number of things going on in it．It was built mostly out of old paraffin tins hammered flat，in various states of rust，like the coral rock，the fossilized structure，from which the spirit of the advancing civilization was steadily fleeing．

The Somali town was farther away from Nairobi，on account，I think，of the Somalis' system of seclusion of their women．There were in my day a few beautiful young Somali women，of whom all the town knew the names，who went and lived in the Bazaar and led the Nairobi police a great dance；they were intelligent，and bewitching people．But the honest Somali women were not seen in the town．The Somali town lay exposed to all winds and was shadeless and dusty，it must have recalled to the Somali their native deserts．Europeans，who live for a long time，even for several generations，in the same place，cannot reconcile themselves to the complete indifference to the surroundings of their homes，of the nomadic races．The Somalis' houses were irregularly strewn on the bare ground，and looked as if they had been nailed together with a bushel of four-inch nails，to last for a week．It was a surprising thing，when you entered one of them，to find it inside so neat and fresh，scented with Arab incenses，with fine carpets and hangings，vessels of brass and silver，and swords with ivory hilts and noble blades．The Somali women themselves had dignified，gentle ways，and were hospitable and gay，with a laughter like silver bells．I was much at home in the Somali village through my Somali servant Farah Aden，who was with me all the time that I was in Africa，and I went to many of their feasts．A big Somali wedding is a magnificent，traditional festivity．As a guest of honour I was taken into the bridal chamber，where the walls and the bridal bed were hung with old，gently glowing weavings and embroideries，and the dark-eyed young bride herself was stiff，like a marshal's baton with heavy silks，gold and amber．

The Somali were cattle-dealers and traders all over the country．For the transport of their goods they kept a number of little grey donkeys in the village，and I have seen camels there as well：haughty，hardened products of the desert，beyond all earthly sufferings，like cactus，and like the Somali．

The Somali bring much trouble upon themselves by terrible tribal quarrels．In this matter they feel and reason differently from other people．Farah belonged to the tribe of Habr Yunis，so that personally in a quarrel I sided with them．At one time there was a great real fight in the Somali town，between the two tribes of Dulba Hantis and Habr Chaolo，with rifle-shooting and fires，and ten or twelve people killed，until the Government interfered．Farah then had a young friend of his own tribe，by name of Sayid，who used to come out to see him at the farm，and who was a graceful boy，so that I was sorry when I was told by my houseboys that Sayid had gone round to visit a Habr Chaolo family in their house，when an angry member of the Dulba Hantis tribe had passed and fired two shots at haphazard through the wall of the house and broken Sayid's leg．I condoled with Farah on his friend's misfortune—“What？Sayid？”Farah cried out with vehemence．“That was good enough for Sayid．Why must he go and drink tea in the house of a Habr Chaolo？”

The Indians of Nairobi dominated the big native business quarter of the Bazaar，and the great Indian merchants had their little Villas just outside the town：Jevanjee，Suleiman Virjee，Allidina Visram．They all had a taste for stonework stairs，balusters，and vases，rather badly cut out of the soft stone of the country—like the structures which children build of pink ornamental bricks．They gave tea-parties in their gardens，with Indian pastry in the style of the Villas，and were clever，travelled，highly polite people．But the Indians in Africa are such grasping tradesmen that with them you would never know if you were face to face with a human individual or with the head of a firm．I had been to Suleiman Virjee's house，and when one day I saw the flag at half mast above his big compound of warehouse，I asked Farah：“Is Suleiman Virjee dead？”“Half dead，”said Farah．“Do they put the flag at half mast when he is half dead？”I asked．“Suleiman is dead，”said Farah．“Virjee is alive．”




Before I took over the management of the farm，I had been keen on shooting and had been out on many safaris．But when I became a farmer I put away my rifles．

The Masai，the nomadic，cattle-owning nation，were neighbours of the farm and lived on the other side of the river；from time to time some of them would come to my house to complain about a lion that was taking their cows，and to ask me to go out and shoot it for them，and I did so if I could．Sometimes，on Saturday，I also walked out on the Orungi plains to shoot a zebra or two as meat for my farm labourers，with a long tail of optimistic young Kikuyu after me．I shot birds on the farm，spurfowl and guineafowl，that are very good to eat．But for many years I was not out on any shooting expedition．

Still，we often talked on the farm of the safaris that we had been on．Camping places fix themselves in your mind as if you had spent long periods of your life in them．You will remember a curve of your wagon track in the grass of the plain，like the features of a friend．

Out on the safaris，I had seen a herd of buffalo，one hundred and twenty-nine of them，come out of the morning mist under a copper sky，one by one，as if the dark and massive，iron-like animals with the mighty horizontally swung horns were not approaching，but were being created before my eyes and sent out as they were finished．I had seen a herd of elephant travelling through the dense native forest，where the sunlight is strewn down between the thick creepers in small spots and patches，pacing along as if they had an appointment at the end of the world．It was，in giant size，the border of a very old，infinitely precious Persian carpet，in the dyes of green，yellow and black-brown．I had time after time watched the progression across the plain of the giraffe，in their queer，inimitable，vegetative gracefulness，as if it were not a herd of animals but a family of rare，long-stemmed，speckled gigantic flowers slowly advancing．I had followed two rhinos on their morning promenade，when they were sniffing and snorting in the air of the dawn—which is so cold that it hurts in the nose—and looked like two very big angular stones rollicking in the long valley and enjoying life together．I had seen the royal lion，before sunrise，below a waning moon，crossing the grey plain on his way home from the kill，drawing a dark wake in the silvery grass，his face still red up to the ears，or during the midday siesta，when he reposed contentedly in the midst of his family on the short grass and in the delicate，spring-like shade of the broad acacia trees of his park of Africa．

All these things were pleasant to think of when times were dull on the farm．And the big game was out there still，in their own country；I could go and look them up once more if I liked．Their nearness gave a shine and play to the atmosphere of the farm．Farah—although with time he came to take a vivid interest in farm affairs—and my old native safari servants，lived in hope of other safaris．

Out in the wilds I had learned to beware of abrupt movements．The creatures with which you are dealing there are shy and watchful，they have a talent for evading you when you least expect it．No domestic animal can be as still as a wild animal．The civilized people have lost the aptitude of stillness，and must take lessons in silence from the wild before they are accepted by it．The art of moving gently，without suddenness，is the first to be studied by the hunter，and more so by the hunter with the camera．Hunters cannot have their own way，they must fall in with the wind，and the colours and smells of the landscape，and they must make the tempo of the ensemble their own．Sometimes it repeats a movement over and over again，and they must follow up with it．

When you have caught the rhythm of Africa，you find that it is the same in all her music．What I learned from the game of the country was useful to me in my dealings with the native people．




The love of woman and womanliness is a masculine characteristic，and the love of man and manliness a feminine characteristic，and there is a susceptibility to the southern countries and races that is a Nordic quality．The Normans must have fallen in love with the foreign countries，first with France and then with England．Those old milords who figure in the history and fiction of the eighteenth century，as constantly travelling in Italy，Greece，and Spain，had not a single Southern trait in their nature，but were drawn and held by the fascination of things wholly different from themselves．The old German and Scandinavian painters，philosophers，and poets，when they first came to Florence and Rome，went down on their knees to adore the South．

A queer illogical patience towards an alien world came out in these impatient people．As it is almost impossible for a woman to irritate a real man，and as to the women，a man is never quite contemptible，never altogether rejectable，as long as he remains a man，so were the hasty red-haired northern people infinitely long-suffering with the tropical countries and races．They would stand no nonsense from their own country or their own relations，but they took the drought of the African highlands，and a case of sun-stroke，the rinderpest on their cattle，and the incompetency of their native servants，with humility and resignation．Their sense of individuality itself was lost in the sense of the possibilities that lie in interaction between those who can be made one by reason of their incongruity．The people of southern Europe and the people of mixed blood have not got this quality；they blame it，or scorn it．So the men's men scorn the sighing lover，and the rational women who have no patience with their men，are in the same way indignant with Griselda．

As for me，from my first weeks in Africa，I had felt a great affection for the Natives．It was a strong feeling that embraced all ages and both sexes．The discovery of the dark races was to me a magnificent enlargement of all my world．If a person with an inborn sympathy for animals had grown up in a milieu where there were no animals，and had come into contact with animals late in life；or if a person with an instinctive taste for woods and forest had entered a forest for the first time at the age of twenty；or if someone with an ear for music had happened to hear music for the firsttime when he was already grown up；their cases might have been similar to mine．After I had met with the Natives，I set out the routine of my daily life to the orchestra．

My father was an officer in the Danish and French army，and as a very young lieutenant at Düppel he wrote home：“Back in Düppel I was officer to a long column．It was hard work，but it was splendid．The love of war is a passion like another，you love soldiers as you love young womenfolk—to madness，and the one love does not exclude the other，as the girls know．But the love of women can include only one at a time，and the love for your soldiers comprehends the whole regiment，which you would like enlarged if it were possible．”It was the same thing with the Natives and me．

It was not easy to get to know the Natives．They were quick of hearing，and evanescent；if you frightened them they could withdraw into a world of their own，in a second，like the wild animals which at an abrupt movement from you are gone—simply are not there．Until you knew a Native well，it was almost impossible to get a straight answer from him．To a direct question as to how many cows he had，he had an eluding reply—“As many as I told you yesterday．”It goes against the feelings of Europeans to be answered in such a manner，it very likely goes against the feelings of the Natives to be questioned in this way．If we pressed or pursued them，to get an explanation of their behaviour out of them，they receded as long as they possibly could，and then they used a grotesque humorous fantasy to lead us on the wrong track．Even small children in this situation had all the quality of old poker players，who do not mind if you overvalue or undervalue their hand，so long as you do not know its real nature．When we really did break into the Natives' existence，they behaved like ants，when you poke a stick into their ant-hill；they wiped out the damage with unwearied energy，swiftly and silently—as if obliterating an unseemly action．

We could not know，and could not imagine，what the dangers were that they feared from our hands．I myself think that they were afraid of us more in the manner in which you are afraid of a sudden terrific noise，than as you are afraid of suffering and death．And yet it was difficult to tell，for the Natives were great at the art of mimicry．In the shambas you would sometimes in the early morning come upon a spurfowl which would run in front of your horse as if her wing was broken，and she was terrified of being caught by the dogs．But her wing was not broken，and she was notafraid of the dogs—she could whir up before them the moment she chose—only she had got her brood of young chickens somewhere near by，and she was drawing our attention away from them．Like the spurfowl，the Natives might be mimicking a fear of us because of some other deeper dread the nature of which we could not guess．Or in the end their behaviour to us might be some sort of strange joke，and the shy people were not afraid of us at all．The Natives have，far less than the white people，the sense of risks in life．Sometimes on a safari，or on the farm，in a moment of extreme tension，I have met the eyes of my Native companions，and have felt that we were at a great distance from one another，and that they were wondering at my apprehension of our risk．It made me reflect that perhaps they were，in life itself，within their own element，such as we can never be，like fishes in deep water which for the life of them cannot understand our fear of drowning．This assurance，this art of swimming，they had，I thought，because they had preserved a knowledge that was lost to us by our first parents；Africa，amongst the continents，will teach it to you：that God and the Devil are one，the majesty coeternal，not two uncreated but one uncreated，and the Natives neither confounded the persons nor divided the substance．

On our safaris，and on the farm，my acquaintance with the Natives developed into a settled and personal relationship．We were good friends．I reconciled myself to the fact that while I should never quite know or understand them，they knew me through and through，and were conscious of the decisions that I was going to take，before I was certain about them myself．For some time I had a small farm up at Gil-Gil，where I lived in a tent，and I travelled by the railway to and fro between Gil-Gil and Ngong．At Gil-Gil，I might make up my mind very suddenly，when it began to rain，to go back to my house．But when I came to Kikuyu，which was our station on the railway line，and from where it was ten miles to the farm，one of my people would be there with a mule for me to ride home on．When I asked them how they had known that I was coming down，they looked away，and seemed uneasy，as if frightened or bored，such as we should be if a deaf person insisted on getting an explanation of a symphony from us．

When the Natives felt safe with us from abrupt movements and sudden noises，they would speak to us a great deal more openly than one European speaks to another．They were never reliable，but in a grand manner sincere．A good name—what is called prestige—meant much in the Native world．They seemed to have made up，at some time，a joint appraisal of you，against which no one would afterwards ever go．

At times，life on the farm was very lonely，and in the stillness of the evenings when the minutes dripped from the clock，life seemed to be dripping out of you with them，just for want of white people to talk to．But all the time I felt the silent overshadowed existence of the Natives running parallel with my own，on a different plane．Echoes went from the one to the other．

The Natives were Africa in flesh and blood．The tall extinct volcano of Longonot that rises above the Rift Valley，the broad mimosa trees along the rivers，the elephant and the giraffe，were not more truly Africa than the Natives were—small figures in an immense scenery．All were different expressions of one idea，variations upon the same theme．It was not a congenial upheaping of heterogeneous atoms，but a heterogeneous upheaping of congenial atoms，as in the case of the oak leaf and the acorn and the object made from oak．We ourselves，in boots，and in our constant great hurry，often jar with the landscape．The Natives are in accordance with it，and when the tall，slim，dark，and dark-eyed people travel—always one by one，so that even the great Native veins of traffic are narrow footpaths—or work the soil，or herd their cattle，or hold their big dances，or tell you a tale，it is Africa wandering，dancing and entertaining you．In the highlands you remember the Poet's words：

Noble found I

ever the Native，

and insipid the Immigrant．



The colony is changing and has already changed since I lived there．When I write down as accurately as possible my experiences on the farm，with the country and with some of the inhabitants of the plains and woods，it may have a sort of historical interest．





A Native Child


Kamante was a small Kikuyu boy，the son of one of my squatters．I used to know my squatter children well，for they both worked for me on the farm，and used to be up round my house herding their goats on the lawns，in the faith that here something of interest might always occur．But Kamante must have lived on the farm for some years before I ever met him；I suppose that he had been leading a seclusive existence like a sick animal．

I came upon him for the first time one day when I was riding across the plain of the farm，and he was herding his people's goats there．He was the most pitiful object that you could set eyes on．His head was big and his body terribly small and thin，the elbows and knees stood out like knots on a stick and both his legs were covered with deep running sores from the thigh to the heel．Here on the plain he looked extraordinarily small，so that it struck you as a strange thing that so much suffering could be condensed into a single point．When I stopped and spoke to him，he did not answer，and hardly appeared to see me．In his flat，angular，harassed，and infinitely patient face，the eyes were without glance，dim like the eyes of a dead person．He looked as if he could not have more than a few weeks to live in，and you expected to see the vultures，which are never far away from death on the plain，high up in the pale burning air over his head．I told him to come round to my house the next morning，so that I could try to cure him．

I was a doctor to the people on the farm most mornings from nine to ten，and like all great quacks I had a large circle of patients，and generally between two and a dozen sick people up by my house then．

The Kikuyu are adjusted for the unforeseen and accustomed to the unexpected．Here they differ from the white men，of whom the majority strive to insure themselves against the unknown and the assaults of fate．The Negro is on friendly terms with destiny，having been in her hands all his time；she is to him，in a way，his home，the familiar darkness of the hut，deep mould for his roots．He faces any change in life with great calm．Amongst the qualities that he will be looking for in a master or a doctor or in God，imagination，I believe，comes high up in the list．It may be on the strength of such a taste that the Caliph Haroun al Raschid maintains，to the hearts of Africa and Arabia，his position as an ideal ruler；with him nobody knew what to expect next，and you did not know where you had him．When the Africans speak of the personality of God they speak like the Arabian Nights or like the last chapters of the book of Job；it is the same quality，the infinite power of imagination，with which they are impressed．

To this characteristic in my people I myself owed my popularity，or my fame，as a doctor．When I first came out to Africa I travelled on the boat with a great German scientist，who was going out，for the twenty-third time，to experiment with cures for sleeping-sickness，and who had over a hundred rats and guinea-pigs on the boat with him．He told me that his difficulty with the Native patients had never been any lack of courage in them—in the face of pain or of a great operation they generally showed little fear—but it was their deep dislike of regularity，of any repeated treatment or the systematization of the whole；and this the great German doctor could not understand．But when I myself got to know the Natives，this quality in them was one of the things that I liked best．They had real courage：the unadulterated liking of danger—the true answer of creation to the announcement of their lot—the echo from the earth when heaven had spoken．I sometimes thought that what，at the bottom of their hearts，they feared from us was pedantry．In the hands of a pedant they die of grief．

My patients waited on a paved terrace outside my house．Here they squatted—the old skeletons of men with tearing coughs and running eyes，the young slim smooth brawlers with black eyes and bruised mouths，and the mothers with their feverish children，like little dry flowers，hanging upon their necks．I often had bad burns to treat，for the Kikuyu at night sleep round the fires in their huts，and the piles of burning wood or charcoal may collapse and slide down on them—when at times I had run out of my store of medicine，I found that honey was not a bad ointment for burns．The atmosphere of the terrace was animated，electric，like the atmosphere of the casinos in Europe．The low lively flow of talk would stop when I came out，but the silence was pregnant with possibilities，now the moment had come when anything might happen．They did，however，always wait for me myself to choose my first patient．

I knew very little of doctoring，just what you learn at a first-aid course．But my renown as a doctor had been spread by a few chance lucky cures，and had not been decreased by the catastrophic mistakes that I had made．

If now I had been able to guarantee my patients a recovery in each single case，who knows but that their circle might have thinned out？I should then have attained a professional prestige—here evidently was a highly efficient doctor from Volaia—but would they still have been sure that the Lord was with me？For of the Lord they knew from the great years of drought，from the lions on the plains at night，and the leopards near the houses when the children were alone there，and from the swarms of grasshoppers that would come on to the land，nobody knew where from，and leave not a leaf of grass where they had passed．They knew him，too，from the unbelievable hours of happiness when the swarm passed over the maize field and did not settle，or when in spring the rains would come early and plentiful，and make all the fields and plains flower and give rich crops．So that this highly capable doctor from Volaia might be after all a sort of outsider where the real great things in life were concerned．




Kamante to my surprise turned up at my house the morning after our first meeting．He stood there，a little away from the three or four other sick people present，erect，with his half-dead face，as if after all he had some feeling of attachment to life，and had now made up his mind to try this last chance of holding on to it．

He showed himself with time to be an excellent patient．He came when he was ordered to come，without fault，and he could keep account of time when he was told to come back every third or fourth day，which is an unusual thing with the Natives．He bore the hard treatment of his sores with a stoicism that I have not known the like of．In all these respects I might have held him up as a model to the others，but I did not do so，for at the same time he caused me much uneasiness of mind．

Rarely，rarely，have I met such a wild creature，a human being who was so utterly isolated from the world，and，by a sort of firm，deadly resignation，completely closed to all surrounding life．I could make him answer when I questioned him，but he never volunteered a word and never looked at me．He had no pity whatever in him，and kept a little scornful laughter of contempt，and of knowing better，for the tears of the other sick children，when they were washed and bandaged，but he never looked at them either．He had no wish for any sort of contact with the world round him，the contacts that he had known of had been too cruel for that．His fortitude of soul in the face of pain was the fortitude of an old warrior．A thing could never be so bad as to surprise him，he was，by his career and his philosophy，prepared for the worst．

All this was in the grand manner，and recalled the declaration of faith of Prometheus：“Pain is my element as hate is thine．Ye rend me now：I care not．”And，“Ay，do thy worst．Thou art omnipotent．”But in a person of his size it was uncomfortable，a thing to make you lose heart．And what will God think—I thought—confronted with this attitude in a small human being？

I remember well the first time that he ever looked at me and spoke to me of his own accord．This must have been some time along in our acquaintance，for I had given up my first mode of treatment，and was trying a new thing，a hot poultice that I had looked up in my books．In my eagerness to do the thing thoroughly，I made it too hot，and as I put it on his leg and clapped the dressing on the top of it Kamante spoke：“Msabu，”he said，and gave me a great glance．The Natives use this Indian word when they address white women，but they pronounce it a little differently，and change it into an African word，with a diverging ring to it．In Kamante's mouth now it was a cry for help，but also a word of warning，such as a loyal friend might give you，to stop you in a proceeding unworthy of you．I thought of it with hope afterwards．I had ambition as a doctor，and I was sorry to have put on the poultice too hot，but I was glad all the same，for this was the first glimpse of an understanding between the wild child and myself．The stark sufferer，who expected nothing but suffering，did not expect it from me．

As far as my doctoring of him went，things did not，however，look hopeful．For a long time I kept on washing and bandaging his leg，but the disease was beyond me．From time to time he would grow a little better，and then the sores would break out in new places．In the end I made up my mind to take him to the hospital of the Scotch Mission．

This decision of mine for once was sufficiently fatal，and had in it enough possibilities，to make an impression on Kamante—he did not want to go．He was prevented by his career and his philosophy from protesting much against anything，but when I drove him to the mission，and delivered him there in the long hospital building，in surroundings entirely foreign and mysterious to him，he trembled．

I had the Church of Scotland Mission as a neighbour twelve miles to the north-west，five hundred feet higher than the farm；and the French Roman Catholic Mission ten miles to the east，on the flatter land，and five hundred feet lower．I did not sympathize with the missions，but personally I was on friendly terms with them both，and regretted that between themselves they should live in a state of hostility．

The French Fathers were my best friends．I used to ride over with Farah，to hear Mass with them on Sunday morning，partly in order to speak French again，and partly because it was a lovely ride to the mission．For a long way the road ran through the Forest Department's old wattle plantation，and the virile fresh pinaceous scent of the wattletrees was sweet and cheering in the mornings．

It was an extraordinary thing to see how the Church of Rome was carrying her atmosphere with her wherever she went．The Fathers had planned and built their church themselves，with the assistance of their Native congregation，and they were with reason very proud of it．There was here a fine big grey church with a bell-tower on it；it was laid out on a broad courtyard，above terraces and stairs，in the midst of their coffee-plantation，which was the oldest in the colony and very skilfully run．On the two other sides of the court were the arcaded refectory and the convent buildings，with the school and the mill down by the river，and to get into the drive up to the church you had to ride over an arched bridge．It was all built in grey stone，and as you came riding down upon it，it looked neat and impressive in the landscape，and might have been lying in a southern canton of Switzerland，or in the north of Italy．

The friendly Fathers lay in wait for me at the church door，when Mass was over，to invite me to un petit verre de vin，across the courtyard in the roomy and cool refectory；there it was wonderful to hear how they knew of everything that was going on in the colony，even to the remotest corners of it．They would also，under the disguise of a sweet and benevolent conversation，draw from you any sort of news that you might possibly have in you，like a small lively group of brown，furry bees—for they all grew long，thick beards—hanging on to a flower for its store of honey．But while they were so interested in the life of the colony，they were all the time in their own French way exiles，patient and cheerful obeisants to some higher orders of a mysterious nature．If it had not been for the unknown authority that kept them in the place，you felt they would not be there，neither would the church of grey stone with the tall bell-tower，nor the arcades，the school or any other part of their neat plantation and mission station．For when the word of relief had been given，all of these would leave the affairs of the colony to themselves and take a beeline back to Paris．

Farah，who had been holding the two ponies while I had been to church，and to the refectory，on the way back to the farm would notice my cheerful spirits—he was himself a pious Mohammedan and did not touch alcohol，but he took the Mass and the wine as coordinant rites of my religion．

The French Fathers sometimes rode on their motor-bicycles to the farm and lunched there，they quoted the fables of Lafontaine to me，and gave me good advice on my coffee-plantation．

The Scotch Mission I did not know so well．There was a splendid view，from up there，over all the surrounding Kikuyu country，but all the same the mission station gave me an impression of blindness，as if it could see nothing itself．The Church of Scotland was working hard to put the Natives into European clothes，which，I thought，did them no good from any point of view．But they had a very good hospital at the mission，and at the time when I was there，it was in charge of a philanthropic，clever head-doctor，Dr．Arthur．They saved the life of many of the people from the farm．

At the Scotch Mission they kept Kamante for three months．During that time I saw him once．I came riding past the mission on my way to the Kikuyu railway station，and the road here for a while runs along the hospital grounds．I caught sight of Kamante in the grounds；he was standing by himself at a little distance from the groups of other convalescents．By this time he was already so much better that he could run．When he saw me he came up to the fence and ran with me as long as it was following the road．He trotted along，on his side of the fence，like a foal in a paddock when，you pass it on horseback，and kept his eyes on my pony，but he did not say a word．At the corner of the hospital grounds he had to stop，and when，as I rode on，I looked back，I saw him standing stock still，with his head up in the air and staring after me，in the exact manner of a foal when you ride away from it．I waved my hand to him a couple of times；the first time he did not react at all，then suddenly his arm went straight up like a pump-spear，but he did not do it more than once．




Kamante came back to my house on the morning of Easter Sunday，and handed me a letter from the hospital people who declared that he was much better and that they thought him cured for good．He must have known something of its contents for he watched my face attentively while I was reading it，but he did not want to discuss it，he had greater things in his mind．Kamante always carried himself with much collected or restrained dignity，but this time he shone with repressed triumph as well．

All Natives have a strong sense for dramatic effects．Kamante had carefully tied old bandages round his legs all the way up to the knee，to arrange a surprise for me．It was clear that he saw the vital importance of the moment，not in his own good luck，but，unselfishly，in the pleasure that he was to give me．He probably remembered the times when he had seen me all upset by the continual failure of my cures with him，and he knew that the result of the hospital's treatment was an astounding thing．As slowly，slowly，he unwound the bandages from his knee to his heel there appeared，underneath them，a pair of whole smooth legs，only slightly marked by grey scars．

When Kamante had thoroughly，and in his calm grand manner，enjoyed my astonishment and pleasure，he again renewed the impression by stating that he was now a Christian．“I am like you，”he said．He added that he thought that I might give him a rupee because Christ had risen on this same day．

He went away to call on his own people．His mother was a widow，and lived a long way away on the farm．From what I heard from her later I believe that he did upon this day make a digression from his habit and unloaded his heart to her of the impressions of strange people and ways that he had received at the hospital．But after his visit to his mother's hut，he came back to my house as if he took it for granted that now he belonged there．He was then in my service from this time till the time that I left the country—for about twelve years．

Kamante when I first met him looked as if he were six years old，but he had a brother who looked about eight，and both brothers agreed that Kamante was the elder of them，so I suppose he must have been set back in growth by his long illness；he was probably then nine years old．He grew up now，but he always made the impression of being a dwarf，or in some way deformed，although you could not put your finger on the precise spot that made him look so．His angular face was rounded with time，he walked and moved easily，and I myself did not think him bad-looking，but I may have looked upon him with something of a creator's eyes．His legs remained forever as thin as sticks．A fantastic figure he always was，half of fun and half of diabolism；with a very slight alteration，he might have sat and stared down，on the top of the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris．He had in him something bright and live；in a painting he would have made a spot of unusually intense colouring；with this he gave a stroke of picturesqueness to my household．He was never quite right in the head，or at least he was always what，in a white person，you would have called highly eccentric．

He was a thoughtful person．Perhaps the long years of suffering that he had lived through had developed in him a tendency to reflect upon things，and to draw his own conclusions from everything he saw．He was all his life，in his own way，an isolated figure．Even when he did the same things as other people he would do them in a different way．

I had an evening school for the people of the farm，with a Native schoolmaster to teach them．I got my schoolmasters from one of the missions，and in my time I have had all three—Roman Catholic，Church of England，and Church of Scotland schoolmasters．For the Native education of the country is run rigorously on religious lines；so far as I know，there are no other books translated into Swaheli than the Bible and the hymnbooks．I myself，during all my time in Africa，was planning to translate Aesop's fables，for the benefit of the Natives，but I never found time to carry my plan through．Still，such as it was，my school was to me a favourite place on the farm，the centre of our spiritual life，and I spent my pleasant evening hours in the long old store-house of corrugated iron in which it was kept．

Kamante would then come with me，but he would not join the children on the school-benches，he would stand a little away from them，as if consciously closing his ears to the learning，and exulting in the simplicity of those who consented to be taken in，and to listen．But in the privacy of my kitchen，I have seen him copying from memory，very slowly and preposterously，those same letters and figures that he had observed on the blackboard in the school．I do not think that he could have come in with other people if he had wanted to；early in his life something in him had been twisted or locked，and now it was，so to say，to him the normal thing to be out of the normal．He was aware of this separateness of his，himself，with the arrogant greatness of soul of the real dwarf，who，when he finds himself at a difference with the whole world，holds the world to be crooked．

Kamante was shrewd in money matters，he spent little，and did a number of wise deals with the other Kikuyu in goats．He married at an early age，and marriage in the Kikuyu world is an expensive undertaking．At the same time I have heard him philosophising，soundly and originally，upon the worthlessness of money．He stood in a peculiar relation to existence on the whole；he mastered it，but he had no high opinion of it．

He had no gift whatever for admiration．He might acknowledge，and think well of the wisdom of animals，but there was，during all the time that I knew him，only one human being of whose good sense I heard him speak approvingly；it was a young Somali woman who some years later came to live on the farm．He had a little mocking laughter，of which he made use in all circumstances，but chiefly towards any self-confidence or grandiloquence in other people．All Natives have in them a strong strain of malice，a shrill delight in things going wrong，which in itself is hurting and revolting to Europeans．Kamante brought this characteristic to a rare perfection，even to a special self-irony，that made him take pleasure in his own disappointments and disasters，nearly exactly as in those of other people．

I have met with the same kind of mentality in the old Native women who have been roasted over many fires，who have mixed blood with Fate，and recognize her irony，wherever they meet it，with sympathy，as if it were that of a sister．On the farm I used to let my houseboys deal out snuff—tombacco the Natives say—to the old women on Sunday mornings，while I myself was still in bed．On this account I had a queer lot of customers round my house on Sundays，like a very old，rumpled，bald and bony poultry yard；and their low cackling—for the Natives will very rarely speak up loudly—made its way through the open windows of my bedroom．On one particular Sunday morning，the gentle lively flow of Kikuyu communications suddenly rose to ripples and cascades of mirth；some highly humorous incident was taking place out there，and I called in Farah to tell me about it．Farah did not like to tell me，for the matter was that he had forgotten to buy snuff，so that today the old women had come a long way，as they say themselves，boori—for nothing．This happening was later on a source of amusement to the old Kikuyu women．Sometimes，when I met one of them on a path in the maize field，she would stand still in front of me，poke a crooked bony finger at me，and，with her old dark face dissolving into laughter，so that all the wrinkles of it were drawn and folded together as by one single secret string being pulled，she would remind me of the Sunday when she and her sisters in the snuff，had walked and walked up to my house，only to find that I had forgotten to get it，and that there was not a grain there—Ha ha Msabu！

The white people often say of the Kikuyu that they know nothing of gratitude．Kamante in any case was not ungrateful，he even gave words to his feeling of an obligation．A number of times，many years after our first meeting，he went out of his way to do me a service for which I had not asked him，and when I questioned him why he had done it，he said that if it had not been for me he should have been dead a long time ago．He showed his gratitude in another manner as well，in a particular kind of benevolent，helpful，or perhaps the right word is forebearing，attitude towards me．It may be that he kept in mind that he and I were of the same religion．In a world of fools，I was，I think，to him one of the greater fools．From the day when he came into my service and attached his fate to mine，I felt his watchful penetrating eyes on me，and my whole modus vivendi subject to clear unbiased criticism；I believe that from the beginning，he looked upon the trouble that I had taken to get him cured as upon a piece of hopeless eccentricity．But he showed me all the time great interest and sympathy，and he laid himself out to guide my great ignorance．On some occasions I found that he had given time and thought to the problem，and that he meant to prepare and illustrate his instructions，in order that they should be easier for me to understand．




Kamante began his life in my house as a dog-toto，later he became a medical assistant to me．There I found out what good hands he had，although you would not have thought so from the look of them，and I sent him into the kitchen to be a cook's boy，a marmiton，under my old cook Esa，who was murdered．After Esa's death he succeeded to him，and he was now my chef all the time that he was with me．

Natives have usually very little feeling for animals，but Kamante differed from type here，as in other things，he was an authoritative dog-boy，and he identified himself with the dogs，and would come and communicate to me what they wished，or missed，or generally thought of things．He kept the dogs free of fleas，which are a pest in Africa，and many times in the middle of the night，he and I，called by the howls of the dogs，have，by the light of a hurricane-lamp，picked off them，one by one，the murderous big ants，the Siafu，which march alone and eat up everything on their way．

He must also have used his eyes at the time when he had been in the mission hospital—even if it had been，as was ever the case with him，without the slightest reverence or prepossession—for he was a thoughtful，inventive doctor's assistant．After he had left this office，he would at times appear from the kitchen to interfere in a case of sickness，and give me very sound advice．

But as a chef he was a different thing，and precluded classification．Nature had here taken a leap and cut away from the order of precedence of faculties and talents，the thing now became mystic and inexplicable，as ever where you are dealing with genius．In the kitchen，in the culinary world，Kamante had all the attributes of genius，even to that doom of genius—the individual's powerlessness in the face of his own powers．If Kamante had been born in Europe，and had fallen into the hands of a clever teacher，he might have become famous，and would have cut a droll figure in history．And out here in Africa he made himself a name，his attitude to his art was that of a master．

I was much interested in cookery myself，and on my first visit back to Europe，I took lessons from a French chef at a celebrated restaurant，because I thought it would be an amusing thing to be able to make good food in Africa．The chef，Monsieur Perrochet，at that time made me an offer to come in with him in his business of the restaurant，for the sake of my devotion to the art．Now when I found Kamante at hand，as a familiar spirit to cook with，this devotion again took hold of me．There was to me a great perspective in our working together．Nothing，I thought，could be more mysterious than this natural instinct in a savage for our culinary art．It made me take another view of our civilization；after all it might be in some way divine and predestinated．I felt like the man who regained his faith in God because a phrenologist showed him the seat in the human brain of theological eloquence：if the existence of theological eloquence could be proved，the existence of theology itself was proved with it，and，in the end，God's existence．

Kamante，in all cooking matters，had a surprising manual adroitness．The great tricks and tours-de-force of the kitchen were child's play to his dark crooked hands；they knew on their own everything about omelettes，vol-au-vents，sauces，and mayonnaises．He had a special gift for making things light，as in the legend the infant Christ forms birds out of clay and tells them to fly．He scorned all complicated tools，as if impatient of too much independence in them，and when I gave him a machine for beating eggs he set it aside to rust，and beat whites of egg with a weeding knife that I had had to weed the lawn with，and his whites of eggs towered up like light clouds．As a cook he had a penetrating，inspired eye，and would pick out the fattest chicken out of a whole poultry-yard，and he gravely weighed an egg in his hand，and knew when it had been laid．He thought out schemes for improvement of my table，and by some means of communication，from a friend who was working for a doctor far away in the country，he got me seed of a really excellent sort of lettuce，such as I had myself for many years looked for in vain．

He had a great memory for recipes．He could not read and he knew no English，so that cookery books were of no use to him，but he must have held all that he was ever taught stored up in his ungraceful head，according to some systematization of his own，which I should never know．He had named the dishes after some event which had taken place on the day they had been shown to him，and he spoke of the sauce of the lightning that struck the tree，and of the sauce of the grey horse that died．But he did not confound any two of these things．There was only one point that I tried to impress upon him without any success：that was the order of the courses within a meal．It became necessary to me，when I had guests for dinner，to draw up for my chef，as if it were a pictorial menu：first a soup-plate，then a fish，then a partridge，or an artichoke．I did not quite believe this shortcoming in him to be due to a faulty memory，but he did，I think，in his own heart，maintain that there is a limit to everything，and that upon anything so completely immaterial，he would not waste his time．

It is a moving thing to work together with a demon．Nominally the kitchen was mine，but in the course of our cooperations，I felt not only the kitchen，but the whole world in which we were cooperating，pass over into Kamante's hands．For here he understood to perfection what I wished of him，and sometimes he carried out my wishes even before I had told him of them；but as to me I could not make clear to myself how or indeed why he worked as he did．It seemed to me a strange thing that anyone could be so great in an art of which he did not understand the real meaning，and for which he felt nothing but contempt．

Kamante could have no idea as to how a dish of ours ought to taste，and he was，in spite of his conversion，and his connection with civilization，at heart an arrant Kikuyu，rooted in the traditions of his tribe and in his faith in them，as in the only way of living worthy of a human being．He did at times taste the food that he cooked，but then with a distrustful face，like a witch who takes a sip out of her cauldron．He stuck to the maize-cobs of his fathers．Here even his intelligence sometimes failed him，and he came and offered me a Kikuyu delicacy—a roasted sweet potato or a lump of sheep's fat—as even a civilized dog，that has lived for a long time with people，will place a bone on the floor before you，as a present．In his heart he did，I feel，all the time，look upon the trouble that we give ourselves about our food，as upon a lunacy．I sometimes tried to extract from him his views upon these things，but although he spoke with great frankness on many subjects，on others he was very close，so that we worked side by side in the kitchen，leaving one another's ideas on the importance of cooking，alone．

I sent Kamante into the Muthaiga Club to learn，and to the cooks of my friends in Nairobi，when I had had a new good dish in their house，and by the time that he had served his apprenticeship，my own house became famous in the colony for its table．This was a great pleasure to me．I longed to have an audience for my art，and I was glad when my friends came out to dine with me；but Kamante cared for the praise of no one．All the same he remembered the individual taste of those of my friends who came most often to the farm．“I shall cook the fish in white wine for Bwana Berkeley Cole，”he said，gravely，as if he were speaking of a demented person．“He sends you out white wine himself to cook fish in．”To get the opinion of an authority，I asked my old friend，Mr．Charles Bulpett of Nairobi，out to dine with me．Mr．Bulpett was a great traveller of the former generation，themselves a generation away from Phineas Fogg；he had been all over the world and had tasted everywhere the best it had to offer，and he had not cared to secure his future so long as he could enjoy the present moment．The books about sport and mountaineering，of fifty years ago，tell of his exploits as an athlete，and of his mountain climbings in Switzerland and Mexico，and there is a book of famous bets called Light Come Light Go，in which you can read of how for a bet he swam the Thames in evening clothes and a high hat—but later on，and more romantically，he swam the Hellespont like Leander and Lord Byron．I was happy when he came out to the farm for a tête-à-tête dinner；there is a particular happiness in giving a man whom you like very much，good food that you have cooked yourself．In return he gave me his ideas on food，and on many other things in the world，and told me that he had nowhere dined better．

The Prince of Wales did me the great honour to come and dine at the farm，and to compliment me on a Cumberland sauce．This is the only time that I have seen Kamante listening with deep interest when I repeated the praise of his cooking to him，for Natives have very great ideas of kings and like to talk about them．Many months after，he felt a longing to hear it once more，and suddenly asked me，like a French reading-book，“Did the son of the Sultan like the sauce of the pig？Did he eat it all？”

Kamante showed his good will towards me outside of the kitchen as well．He wanted to help me，in accordance with his own ideas of the advantages and dangers in life．

One night，after midnight，he suddenly walked into my bedroom with a hurricane-lamp in his hand，silent，as if on duty．It must have been only a short time after he first came into my house，for he was very small；he stood by my bedside like a dark bat that had strayed into the room，with very big spreading ears，or like a small African Will-o'-the-wisp，with his lamp in his hand．He spoke to me very solemnly，“Msabu，”he said，“I think you had better get up．”I sat up in bed bewildered；I thought that if anything serious had happened，it would have been Farah who would have come to fetch me，but when I told Kamante to go away again，he did not move．“Msabu，”he said again，“I think that you had better get up．I think that God is coming．”When I heard this，I did get up，and asked him why he thought so．He gravely led me into the dining-room which looked west，towards the hills．From the door-windows I now saw a strange phenomenon．There was a big grass-fire going on，out in the hills，and the grass was burning all the way from the hill top to the plain；when seen from the house it was a nearly vertical line．It did indeed look as if some gigantic figure was moving and coming towards us．I stood for some time and looked at it，with Kamante watching by my side；then I began to explain the thing to him．I meant to quiet him，for I thought that he had been terribly frightened．But the explanation did not seem to make much impression on him one way or the other；he clearly took his mission to have been fulfilled when he had called me．“Well yes，”he said，“it may be so．But I thought that you had better getup in case it was God coming．”





The Savage in the Immigrant's House


One year the long rains failed．

That is a terrible，tremendous experience，and the farmer who has lived through it will never forget it．Years afterwards，away from Africa，in the wet climate of a northern country，he will start up at night，at the sound of a sudden shower of rain，and cry，“At last，at last．”

In normal years the long rains began in the last week of March and went on into the middle of June．Up to the time of the rains，the world grew hotter and drier every day，feverish，as in Europe before a great thunderstorm，only more so．

The Masai，who were my neighbours on the other side of the river，at that time set fire to the bast-dry plains to get new green grass for their cattle with the first rain，and the air over the plains danced with the mighty conflagration；the long grey and rainbow-tinted layers of smoke rolled along over the grass，and the heat and the smell of burning were drifted in over the cultivated land as from a furnace．

Gigantic clouds gathered，and dissolved again，over the landscape；a light distant shower of rain painted a blue slanting streak across the horizon．All the world had only one thought．

On an evening just before sunset，the scenery drew close round you，the hills came near and were vigorous，meaningful，in their clear，deep blue and green colouring．A couple of hours later you went out and saw that the stars had gone，and you felt the night air soft and deep and pregnant with benefaction．

When the quickly growing rushing sound wandered over your head it was the wind in the tall forest trees—and not the rain．When it ran along the ground it was the wind in the shrubs and the long grass—and not the rain．When it rustled and rattled just above the ground it was the wind in the maize fields—where it sounded so much like rain that you were taken in，time after time，and even got a certain content from it，as if you were at least shown the thing you longed for acted on a stage—and not the rain．

But when the earth answered like a sounding-board in a deep fertile roar，and the world sang round you in all dimensions，all above and below—that was the rain．It was like coming back to the sea，when you have been a long time away from it，like a lover's embrace．

But one year the long rains failed．It was，then，as if the universe were turning away from you．It grew cooler，on some days it would be cold，but there was no sign of moisture in the atmosphere．Everything became drier and harder，and it was as if all force and gracefulness had withdrawn from the world．It was not bad weather or good weather，but a negation of all weather，as if it had been deferred sine die．A bleak wind，like a draught，ran over your head，all colour faded from all things；the smells went away from the fields and forests．This feeling of being in disgrace with the Great Powers pressed on you．To the south，the burnt plains lay black and waste，striped with grey and white ashes．

With every day，in which we now waited for the rain in vain，prospects and hopes of the farm grew dim，and disappeared．The ploughing，pruning and planting of the last months turned out to be a labour of fools．The farm work slowed off，and stood still．

On the plains and in the hills，the waterholes dried up，and many new kinds of ducks and geese came to my pond．To the pond on the boundary of the farm，the zebra came wandering in the early mornings and at sunset to drink，in long rows，two or three hundred of them，the foals walking with the mares，and they were not afraid of me when I rode out amongst them．But we tried to keep them off the land for the sake of our cattle，for the water was sinking in the ponds．Still it was a pleasure to go down there，where the rushes growing in the mud made a green patch in the brown landscape．

The Natives became silent under the drought．I could not get a word on the prospects out of them，although you would have thought that they should have known more about the signs of the weather than we did．It was their existence which was at stake，it was not an unheard-of thing to them—and had not been to their fathers—to lose nine tenths of their stock in the great years of drought．Their shambas were dry，with a few drooping and withering sweet-potato and maize plants．

After a time I learned their manner from them，and gave up talking of the hard times or complaining about them，like a person in disgrace．But I was a European，and I had not lived long enough in the country to acquire the absolute passivity of the Native，as some Europeans will do，who live for many decennaries in Africa．I was young，and by instinct of self preservation，I had to collect my energy on something，if I were not to be whirled away with the dust on the farm roads，or the smoke on the plain．I began in the evenings to write stories，fairy-tales and romances，that would take my mind a long way off，to other countries and times．

I had been telling some of the stories to a friend when he came to stay on the farm．

When I got up and went outside，there was a cruel wind blowing，the sky was clear and set with millions of hard stars，everything was dry．

At first I wrote in the evenings only，but later on I often sat down to write in the mornings as well，when I ought to have been out on the farm．It was difficult，out there，to decide whether we ought to plough the maize field up again and plant it a second time，and whether we ought to strip the withering coffee berries off the trees to save the trees，or not．I put the decisions off from day to day．

I used to sit and write in the dining-room，with papers spread all over the dinner table，for I had accounts and estimates of the farm to do，in between my stories，and little desolate notes from my farm manager to answer．My houseboys asked me what I was doing；when I told them I was trying to write a book，they looked upon it as a last attempt to save the farm through the hard times，and took an interest in it．Later they asked me how my book was proceeding．They would come in，and stand for a long time watching the progress of it，and in the panelled room their heads were so much the colour of the panels，that at night it looked as if they were white robes only，keeping me company with their backs to the wall．




My dining-room looked west，and had three long windows that opened out to the paved terrace，the lawn，and the forest．The land here sloped down to the river that formed the boundary between me and the Masai．You could not see the river itself from the house，but you could follow its winding course by the design of the dark-green big acacias which grew along it．To the other side of it the wood-clad land rose again，and over the woods were the green plains that reached to the foot of the Ngong Hills．

“And were my faith so strong that it could move mountains，that is the mountain that I would make come to me．”

The wind blew from the east：the doors of my dining-room，to lee，were always open，and for this reason the west side of the house was popular with the Natives；they laid their way round it，to keep in touch with what was going on inside．From the same motive the little Native herdboys brought their goats round and made them graze on the lawn．

These little boys，who wandered about on the farm in the company of their fathers' herds of goats and sheep，looking up grazing for them，did in a way form a link between the life of my civilized house and the life of the wild．My houseboys distrusted them and did not like them to come into the rooms，but the children had a real love and enthusiasm for civilization；to them it held no dangers at all，for they could leave it again whenever they liked．The central symbol of it to them was an old German cuckoo-clock that hung in the dining-room．A clock was entirely an object of luxury in the African highlands．All the year round you could tell，from the position of the sun，what the time was，and as you had no dealings with railways，and could arrange your life on the farm according to your own wishes，it became a matter of no importance．But this was a very fine clock．In the midst of a cluster of pink roses，at every full hour，a cuckoo here flung up its little door and threw itself forward to announce the hour in a clear insolent voice．Its apparition was every time a fresh delight to the young people of the farm．From the position of the sun，they judged accurately when the moment for the midday call was due，and by a quarter to twelve I could see them approaching the house from all sides，at the tail of their goats，which they dared not leave behind．The heads of the children and of the goats swam through the bush and long grass of the forest like heads of frogs in a pond．

They left their flocks on the lawn and came in noiselessly on their bare feet；the bigger ones were about ten years and the youngest two years．They behaved very well，and kept up a sort of self-made ceremonial for their visits，which came to this：that they could move about freely in the house so long as they did not touch anything，nor sit down，nor speak unless spoken to．As the cuckoo rushed out on them，a great movement of ecstasy and suppressed laughter ran through the group．It also sometimes happened that a very small herdboy，who did not feel any responsibility about the goats，would come back in the early morning all by himself，stand for a long time in front of the clock，now shut up and silent，and address it in Kikuyu in a slow sing-song declaration of love，then gravely walk out again．My houseboys laughed at the herdboys，and confided to me that the children were so ignorant that they believed the cuckoo to be alive．

Now my houseboys came in themselves to watch the work of the typewriter．Kamante sometimes stood by the wall for an hour in the evening，his eyes ran to and fro like dark drops under the eyelashes，as if he meant to learn enough about the machine to take it to pieces and put it together again．

One night as I looked up I met these profound attentive eyes and after a moment he spoke．“Msabu，”he said，“do you believe yourself that you can write a book？”

I answered that I did not know．

To figure to oneself a conversation with Kamante one must imagine a long，pregnant，as if deeply responsible，pause before each phrase．All natives are masters in the art of the pause and thereby give perspective to a discussion．

Kamante now made such a long pause，and then said，“I do not believe it．”

I had nobody else to discuss my book with；I laid down my paper and asked him why not．I now found that he had been thinking the conversation over before，and prepared himself for it；he stood with the Odyssey itself behind his back，and here he laid it on the table．

“Look，Msabu，”he said，“this is a good book．It hangs together from the one end to the other．Even if you hold it up and shake it strongly，it does not come to pieces．The man who has written it is very clever．But what you write，”he went on，both with scorn and with a sort of friendly compassion，“is some here and some there．When the people forget to close the door it blows about，even down on the floor and you are angry．It will not be a good book．”

I explained to him that in Europe the people would be able to fix it all up together．

“Will your book then be as heavy as this？”Kamante asked，weighing the Odyssey．

When he saw that I hesitated he handed it to me in order that I might judge for myself．

“No，”I said，“it will not，but there are other books in the library，as you know，that are lighter．”

“And as hard？”he asked．

I said it was expensive to make a book so hard．

He stood for some time in silence and then expressed his greater hopes of my book，and perhaps also repentance of his doubts，by picking up the scattered pages from the floor and laying them on the table．Still he did not go away，but stood by the table and waited，and then asked me gravely：“Msabu，what is there in books？”

As an illustration，I told him the story from the Odyssey of the hero and Polyphemus，and of how Odysseus had called himself Noman，had put out Polyphemus' eye，and had escaped tied up under the belly of a ram．

Kamante listened with interest and expressed as his opinion，that the ram must have been of the same race as the sheep of Mr．Long，of Elmentaita，which he had seen at the cattle-show in Nairobi．He came back to Polyphemus，and asked me if he had been black，like the Kikuyu．When I said no，he wanted to know if Odysseus had been of my own tribe or family．

“How did he，”he asked，“say the word，Noman，in his own language？Say it．”

“He said Outis，”I told him．“He called himself Outis，which in his language means Noman．”

“Must you write about the same thing？”he asked me．

“No，”I said，“people can write of anything they like．I might write of you．”

Kamante who had opened up in the course of the talk，here suddenly closed again，he looked down himself and asked me in a low voice，what part of him I would write about．

“I might write about the time when you were ill and were out with the sheep on the plain，”I said，“what did you think of then？”

His eyes wandered over the room，up and down；in the end he said vaguely：“Sejui”—I know not．

“Were you afraid？”I asked him．

After a pause，“Yes，”he said firmly，“all the boys on the plain are afraid sometimes．”

“Of what were you afraid？”I said．

Kamante stood silent for a little while，then he looked at me；his face became collected and deep，his eyes gazed inward：

“Of Outis，”he said．“The boys on the plain are afraid of Outis．”

A few days later，I heard Kamante explain to the other houseboys that in Europe the book which I was writing could be made to stick together，and that with terrible expense it could even be made as hard as the Odyssey，which was again displayed．He himself，however，did not believe that it could be made blue．




Kamante had a talent of his own that became of use to him in my house．He could，I believe，cry when he wanted to．

If ever I scolded him in earnest，he stood up straight before me and looked me in the face，with that watchful，deep sadness which the faces of the Natives take on in a single moment；then his eyes swelled，and filled with heavy tears that slowly，one by one，rolled out and down over his cheeks．I knew them to be pure crocodile's tears，and in other people they would not have affected me．But with Kamante it was a different thing．His flat wooden face，on these occasions，sank back into the world of darkness and infinite loneliness，in which he had dwelt for many years．Such heavy，dumb tears he might have wept as a little boy on the plain，with the sheep round him．They made me uneasy，and gave to the sins for which I scolded him a different aspect，a smaller look，so that I did not want to go on talking about them．In a way it was a demoralizing thing．Still I believe that by strength of the true human understanding which existed between us，Kamante knew in his heart that I looked through his tears of contrition and did not take them for more than they were—indeed that he himself looked upon them more as a ceremony due to the higher powers，than as any attempt to deceive．




He often referred to himself as a Christian．I did not know what idea he attached to the name，and once or twice I tried to catechize him，but then he explained to me that he believed what I believed，and that，since I myself must know what I believed，there was no sense in me questioning him．I found that this was more than an evasion，it was in a way his positive programme，or confession of faith．He had given himself under the God of the white people．In his service he was prepared to carry out any order，but he would not take upon himself to give reasons for a working system which might prove to be as unreasonable as the working systems of the white people themselves．

It sometimes happened that my behaviour clashed with the teachings of the Scotch Mission，where he had been converted；then he would ask me which was right．

The lack of prejudice in the Natives is a striking thing，for you expect to find dark taboos in the primitive people．It is due，I believe，to their acquaintance with a variety of races and tribes，and to the lively human intercourse that was brought upon East Africa，first by the old traders of ivory and slaves，and in our days by the settlers and big-game hunters．Nearly every Native，down to the little herdboys of the plains，has in his day stood face to face with a whole range of nations as different from one another，and to him，as a Sicilian to an Esquimo：Englishmen，Jews，Boers，Arabs，Somali Indians，Swaheli，Masai and Kawirondo．As far as receptivity of ideas goes the Native is more of a man of the world than the suburban or provincial settler or missionary，who has grown up in a uniform community and with a set of stable ideas．Much of the misunderstanding between the white people and the Natives arises from this fact．

It is an alarming experience to be，in your person，representing Christianity to the Natives．

There was a young Kikuyu by the name of Kitau，who came in from the Kikuyu Reserve and took service with me．He was a meditative boy，an observant，attentive servant and I liked him well．After three months he one day asked me to give him a letter of recommendation to my old friend Sheik Ali bin Salim，the Lewali of the Coast，at Mombasa，for he had seen him in my house and now，he said，he wished to go and work for him．I did not want Kitau to leave just when he had learned the routine of the house，and I said to him that I would rather raise his pay．No，he said he was not leaving to get any higher pay，but he could not stay．He told me that he had made up his mind，up in the Reserve，that he would become either a Christian or a Mohammedan，only he did not yet know which．For this reason he had come and worked for me，since I was a Christian，and he had stayed for three months in my house to see the testurde—the ways and habits—of the Christians．From me he would go for three months to Sheik Ali in Mombasa and study the testurde of the Mohammedans；then he would decide．I believe that even an archbishop，when he had had these facts laid before him，would have said，or at least have thought，as I said：“Good God，Kitau，you might have told me that when you came here．”

The Mohammedans will not eat meat of any animal that has not had its throat cut by a Mohammedan in the orthodox manner．This is often a difficulty on a safari，where you carry few provisions with you，and are dependent for your servants' food on the game you shoot．When you shoot a kongoni and it falls，your Mohammedans rush at it，as upon wings，to be in time to cut the throat of it before it dies，and you yourself watch them in suspense，with burning eyes，for if they are seen standing over it with hanging arms and head，it means that the kongoni has died before they got up to it，and you will have to stalk another kongoni，or your gun bearers will go starving．

When in the beginning of the war I was going out with my ox-wagons，the night before I started I happened to meet the Mohammedan Shereef up at Kijabe；I asked him if he could not give my people dispensation from the law for as long as our safari lasted．

The Shereef was a young man，but wise，and he talked with Farah and Ismail and pronounced：“This lady is a disciple of Jesus Christ．When she fires off her rifle，she will say，or at least in her heart say：In the name of God，which will make her bullets equivalent to the knife of the orthodox Mohammedan．For the length of time of this journey，you can eat the meat of the animals that she shoots．”




The prestige of the Christian religion in Africa was weakened by the intolerance that the one Christian church showed towards the other．

On Christmas nights while I was in Africa I used to drive over to the French Mission to hear the Midnight Mass．It was generally hot at this time of the year；as you drove through the wattle plantation，you heard the chiming of the mission bell a long way in the clear warm air．A crowd of happy，lively people were at the place round the church when you arrived，the French and Italian shopkeepers of Nairobi with their families had come out，the nuns from the convent school were present，and the Native congregation swarmed in gay clothes．The big fine church was lighted with many hundred candles and with great transparencies which the Fathers had themselves made．

When Christmas came，in the first year after Kamante had come into my house，I told him that I was going to take him with me to the Mass，as a fellow Christian，and described to him the beautiful things that he was going to see there，in the manner of the Fathers themselves．Kamante listened to it all，moved in his soul，and put on the best clothes he had．But when the car was at the door，he came back in great agitation of mind and said that he could not possibly come with me．He did not want to give me his reasons，and flinched from my questions；in the end it came out．No，he could not go，he had by now realized that it was to the French Mission that I meant to take him，and he had been so strongly warned against that mission when he had been in Hospital．I explained to him that this was all a misunderstanding，and that he must come now．But at that he began to turn to stone before my eyes，he died，he turned up his eyes so that only the white showed in them and sweated in the face．

“No，no，Msabu，”he whispered，“I am not coming with you．There inside that big church，I know it well，there is a Msabu who is mbaia sana，”—terribly bad．

When I heard this I became very sad，but I thought that now I would indeed have to take him with me so that the Virgin herself could enlighten him．The Fathers had a life-size pasteboard statue of the Virgin in their church，all blue and white，and the Natives are generally impressed by statues，while it is difficult for them to conceive the idea of a picture．So I promised Kamante my protection and took him with me，and when he walked into the church，very close at my heels，he forgot all his scruples．It happened to be the finest Christmas Mass that they had ever had at the mission．There was in the church a very big Nativity—a grotto with the Holy Family，just out from Paris，which was illuminated by radiant stars in a blue sky，and it had round it a hundred toy animals，wooden cows and pure white cotton wool lambs，without any petty consideration as to their size，that must have raised ecstasy in the hearts of the Kikuyus．




After Kamante had become a Christian he was no longer afraid to touch a dead body．

Earlier in his life he had been afraid of it，and when a man，who had been carried on a stretcher up to the terrace by my house，died there，he would no more than the others lend a hand to carry him back；he did not recede，like the other people，on to the lawn，but he stood immovable upon the pavement，a little dark monument．Why the Kikuyu，who personally have so little fear of death，should be so terrified to touch a corpse，while the white people，who are afraid to die，handle the dead easily，I do not know．Here once more you feel their reality to be different from our realities．But all farmers know that here is a domain on which you cannot control the Native，and that you will save yourself trouble if you give up the idea at once，for he will really rather die than change his ways．

Now the terror had disappeared out of Kamante's heart；he scorned it in his kinsmen．He did even show off a little here，as if to boast of the power of his God．It happened that I had opportunities to test his faith，and that Kamante and I came to carry three dead people between us，in the course of our life on the farm．One was a young Kikuyu girl who was run over by an ox cart outside my house．The second was a young Kikuyu who was killed while he was felling trees in the forest．The third was an old white man who came to live on the farm，played a part in the life of it，and died there．

He was a countryman of mine，an old blind Dane by the name of Knudsen．One day when I was in Nairobi he fumbled his way up to my car，presented himself，and asked me to give him a house on my land，as he had no place in the world to stay in．I had at that time been reducing my staff of white people on the plantation，and had an empty bungalow that I could lend him，and he came out and lived on the farm for six months．

He was a singular figure to have on a highland farm：so much a creature of the sea that it was as if we had had an old clipped albatross with us．He was all broken by the hardships of life，and by disease and drink，bent and crooked，with the curious colouring of redhaired people gone white，as if he had in reality strewn ashes upon his head，or as if he was marked by his own element and had been salted．But there was an unquenchable flame in him which no ashes could cover．He came of Danish fisherman stock and had been a sailor，and later one of the very early pioneers of Africa—whatever wind it was that blew him there．

Old Knudsen had tried a great many things in his life，preferably such as have to do with water or fish or birds，and had done well on none of them．At one time，he told me，he had owned a very fine fishing concern on Lake Victoria，with many miles of the best fishing nets in the world，and with a motorboat．But during the war he had lost it all．In his recounting of this tragedy of his，there was a dark moment of fatal misunderstanding，or of the treason of a friend．I do not know which，for the tale was never quite the same at the various times when it was told to me，and it brought Old Knudsen into a terrible state of mind when he came to this point of his recital．There was，all the same，some real fact in the story，for in compensation of his losses，the Government，while he was staying with me，paid him a sort of pension of a shilling a day．

All this he told me on the occasions when he came up on a visit to my house．He often took refuge in me，for he was uncomfortable in his own bungalow．The small Native boys，whom I gave him as servants，ran away from him again and again，because he frightened them by rushing at them blindly，head foremost，and fumbling with his stick．But when he was in high spirits he would sit on my verandah over a cup of coffee and sing Danish patriotic songs to me，all by himself，with great energy．It was a pleasure to both him and me to speak Danish，so we exchanged many remarks over insignificant happenings on the farm，just for the joy of talking．But I did not always have patience with him，for when he had once arrived it was difficult to make him stop talking and go away；in our daily intercourse he had，as was to be expected，much of the Ancient Mariner，or of the Old Man of the Sea．

He had been a great artist at the making of fishing nets—the best fishing nets in the world，he told me—and here，in the bungalow of the farm，he made kibokos—the Native whips which are cut out of hippo hide．He would buy a hippo hide from the Natives or the farmers up at Lake Naivasha，and if he was lucky he could make fifty kibokos out of one hide．I have still a ridingwhip which he gave me；it is a very fine whip．This work spread a terrible stench round his house，like the stench round the nest of some old carrion-bird．Later on，when I made a pond on the farm，he was nearly always to be found by the pond，in deep thought，with his reflection vertically under him，like a sea-bird in a zoo．

Old Knudsen had in his frail sunken breast the simple，fierce，irascible，wild heart of a small boy，who burns with the unadulterated love of fighting；he was a great romantic bully and combatant．He was a singularly good hater，always afire with indignation and rage against nearly all the people and institutions with which he came in touch；he called heaven to let fire and brimstone rain down on them，and“painted the devil on the wall，”as we say in Denmark，in a Michaelangelesque manner．He was highly delighted whenever he could set other people by the ears，like a small boy who sets two dogs fighting，or a dog at a cat．It was an impressive and formidable thing that Old Knudsen's soul should still—after his long hard life，and when he had at last，so to say，been washed into a quiet creek where he might have lain with his sails slacked—cry out for opposition and adversity，like the soul of a boy．It made me respect it，as the soul of a Berserk．

He never spoke of himself except in the third person，as“Old Knudsen，”and never without boasting and bragging to the last degree．There was not a thing in the world that Old Knudsen would not undertake and carry through，and not a champion fighter whom Old Knudsen could not knock down．Wherever other people were concerned，he was a black pessimist，and he foresaw a near，catastrophic and well-deserved end to all their activities．But on his own behalf he was a furious optimist．A short time before he died he confided to me，under the promise of secrecy，a tremendous plan．It would make Old Knudsen，at last，a millionaire and put all his enemies to shame．He was，he told me，going to lift，from the bottom of Lake Naivasha，the hundred thousand tons of guano dropped there，from the time of the creation of the world，by the swimming-birds．In a last colossal effort he made a journey from the farm to Lake Naivasha，to study and work out the details of his plan．He died in the lustre of it．The scheme had in it all the elements dear to his heart：deep water，birds，hidden treasures；it had even a flavour of the things that one ought not to talk to ladies about．At the top of it he saw，with the eyes of his mind，triumphant Old Knudsen himself，with a trident，controlling the waves．I do not remember if he ever explained to me how the guano was to be brought up from the bottom of the lake．

The great exploits and achievements of Old Knudsen and his eminence in everything，as he reported these things to me，were clearly at variance with the weakness and impotency of the old man who reported them；in the end you felt that you were dealing with two separate and essentially different individualities．The mighty figure of Old Knudsen rose in the background，unbeaten and triumphant，the hero of all the adventures，and it was his old，bent and worn servant whom I knew，and who never tired of telling me about him．This little，humble man had made it his mission in life to uphold and extol the name of Old Knudsen，even to death．For he had really seen Old Knudsen，which nobody else except God ever had，and after that he would stand no heresy in anyone．

One single time have I heard him make use of the first personal pronoun．This was a couple of months before he died．He had had a bad heart-attack，the same thing that killed him in the end，and when I had not seen him on the farm for a week I went down to his bungalow to get news of him，and I found him，in the middle of the stench from the hippo hide，in bed in a very bare and untidy room．He was ashen grey in the face，his dim eyes were sunk deep back．He did not answer me or speak a word when I spoke to him．Only after a long time，and when I had already got up to go away，he suddenly said in a small hoarse voice，“I am very sick．”At that time there was no talk of Old Knudsen，who surely was never ill or overcome；it was the servant，who just for once allowed himself to express his individual misery and anguish．

Old Knudsen was dull on the farm，so from time to time he locked the door of his house，made off and disappeared from our horizon．It was most often，I think，when he had had news that an old friend，some other pioneer of the glorious past，had arrived in Nairobi．He would stay away，for a week or a fortnight，until we had half forgotten his existence，and he always came back so terribly ill and worn out that he could hardly drag himself along，or unlock his door．He then kept to himself for a couple of days．I believe that on these occasions he was afraid of me，for he thought that I would be sure to have disapproved of his escapades，and that I would now profit by his weakness to triumph over him．Old Knudsen，although he would sometimes sing of the sailor's bride who loves the waves，in his heart had a deep mistrust of woman，and saw her as the enemy of man，by instinct，and on principle，out to stop his fun．




On the day of his death he had in this way been absent for a fortnight，and nobody on the farm was aware that he had come back．But he himself must this time have meant to make an exception from his rule，for he had been on the way from his own house to mine，by a path which ran through the plantation，when he fell down and died．Kamante and I found him lying on the path as，late in the afternoon，we were going out to look for mushrooms on the plain，in the new short grass，for it was April，in the beginning of the long rains．

It was befitting that it should be Kamante who found him，for，alone of all the Natives of the farm，he had shown Old Knudsen sympathy．He had even taken an interest in him，as one deviation from the normal in another，and from time to time of his own accord had brought him eggs，and kept an eye on his Totos，which had prevented them from running away altogether．

The old man lay on his back，his hat had rolled a little away when he fell，his eyes were not quite closed．In death he looked essentially collected．There you are at last，Old Knudsen—I thought．

I wanted to carry him to his house，but I knew that it would be of no use to call in any of the Kikuyus who might be about，or working in their own shambas close by，to help me；they would only run away immediately when they saw why I had called them．I ordered Kamante to run back to the house and fetch down Farah to assist me．But Kamante did not move．

“Why do you want me to run？”he asked．

“Well you see yourself，”I said，“that I cannot carry the old Bwana alone，and you Kikuyus are fools，you are afraid to carry a dead man．”

Kamante set up his little mocking noiseless laughter．“You again forget，Msabu，”he said，“that I am a Christian．”

He lifted the old man's feet while I bore his head，and between us we carried him to his bungalow．From time to time we had to stop，lay him down，and rest；then Kamante stood up erect and looked straight down at Old Knudsen's feet，with what I think will have been the Scotch Mission manner in the presence of death．

As we had laid him on his bed，Kamante went about the room，and into the kitchen，in search of a towel to cover his face with—he only found an old newspaper．“The Christians did that at the hospital，”he explained to me．

A long time afterwards Kamante had great satisfaction out of the thought of this instance of my ignorance．He would work with me in the kitchen，filled with a secret pleasure，and suddenly break out laughing．“Do you remember，Msabu，”he said，“the time when you had forgotten that I was a Christian，and thought that I should be afraid to help you to carry the Msungu Mse？”—the old white man．

Kamante as a Christian was no longer afraid of snakes．I heard him state to the other boys that a Christian might at any moment put his heel upon the head of the largest snake and crush it．I have not seen him try to do so，but I saw him standing very still，with a set face and his hands behind his back，within a short distance of the cook's hut when a puff-adder had appeared on its roof．All the children of my household spread in large circles around it，like chaff before the wind，with wild wails，while Farah went into the house to fetch my gun，and shot the puff-adder．

When it was all over，and the waves had settled down again，Nyore，the Sice's son，said to Kamante：“Why，you Kamante，did you not set your heel upon the head of the big bad snake and crush it？”

“Because it was up on the roof，”said Kamante．




At one time，I tried to shoot with a bow and arrow．I was strong，but it was difficult to me to bend the Wanderobo bow which Farah had got for me；still in the end，and after long practice，I became skilful as an archer．

Kamante was very small then：he used to watch me when I was shooting on the lawn，and seemed doubtful about the undertaking，and one day said to me：“Are you a Christian still when you are shooting with a bow？I thought that the Christian way was with a rifle．”

I showed him in my pictorial Bible an illustration to the tale of Hagar's son：“And God was with the lad；and he grew，and dwelt in the wilderness，and became an archer．”

“Well，”said Kamante，“he was like you．”




Kamante had a good hand with sick animals，as with my Native patients．He took out splinters from the dogs' feet，and once cured one of them when it had been bitten by a snake．

For some time I had in the house a stork with a broken wing．He was a decided character，he walked through the rooms and when he came into my bedroom he fought tremendous duels，as with the rapier，with swaggering and flapping of wings，with his image in my looking-glass．He followed Kamante about between the houses，and it was impossible not to believe that he was deliberately imitating Kamante's stiff measured walk．Their legs were about the same thickness．The little Native boys had an eye for caricature and shouted with joy when they saw the pair pass．Kamante understood the joke，but he never paid much attention to what other people thought of him．He sent off the little boys to collect frogs for the stork in the bogs．

It was also Kamante who had charge of Lulu．





A Gazelle


Lulu came to my house from the woods as Kamante had come to it from the plains．

To the east of my farm lay the Ngong Forest Reserve，which then was nearly all virgin forest．To my mind it was a sad thing when the old forest was cut down，and eucalyptus and grevillea planted in its place；it might have made a unique pleasure ground and park for Nairobi．

An African native forest is a mysterious region．You ride into the depths of an old tapestry，in places faded and in others darkened with age，but marvellously rich in green shades．You cannot see the sky at all in there，but the sunlight plays in many strange ways，falling through the foliage．The grey fungus，like long drooping beards，on the trees，and the creepers hanging down everywhere，give a secretive，recondite air to the native forest．I used to ride here with Farah on Sundays，when there was nothing to do on the farm，up and down the slopes，and across the little winding forest streams．The air in the forest was cool like water，and filled with the scent of plants，and in the beginning of the long rains when the creepers flowered，you rode through sphere after sphere of fragrance．One kind of African Daphne of the woods，which flowers with a small cream coloured sticky blossom，had an overwhelming sweet perfume，like lilac，and wild lily of the valley．Here and there，hollow tree-stems were hung up in ropes of hide on a branch；the Kikuyu hung them there to make the bees build in them，and to get honey．Once as we turned a corner in the forest，we saw a leopard sitting on the road，a tapestry animal．

Here，high above the ground，lived a garrulous restless nation，the little grey monkeys．Where a pack of monkeys had travelled over the road，the smell of them lingered for a long time in the air，a dry and stale，mousy smell．As you rode on you would suddenly hear the rush and whizz over your head，as the colony passed along on its own ways．If you kept still in the same place for some time you might catch sight of one of the monkeys sitting immovable in a tree，and，a little after，discover that the whole forest round you was alive with his family，placed like fruits on the branches，grey or dark figures according to how the sunlight fell on them，all with their long tails hanging down behind them．They gave out a peculiar sound，like a smacking kiss with a little cough to follow it；if from the ground you imitated it，you saw the monkeys turn their heads from one side to the other in an affected manner，but if you made a sudden movement they were all off in a second，and you could follow the decreasing swash as they clove the tree-tops，and disappeared in the wood like a shoal of fishes in the waves．

In the Ngong Forest I have also seen，on a narrow path through thick growth，in the middle of a very hot day，the giant forest hog，a rare person to meet．He came suddenly past me，with his wife and three young pigs，at a great speed，the whole family looking like uniform，bigger and smaller figures cut out in dark paper，against the sunlit green behind them．It was a glorious sight，like a reflection in a forest pool，like a thing that had happened a thousand years ago．

Lulu was a young antelope of the bushbuck tribe，which is perhaps the prettiest of all the African antelopes．They are a little bigger than the fallow-deer；they live in the woods，or in the bush，and are shy and fugitive，so that they are not seen as often as the antelopes of the plains．But the Ngong Hills，and the surrounding country，were good places for bushbuck，and if you had your camp in the hills，and were out hunting in the early morning，or at sunset，you would see them come out of the bush into the glades，and as the rays of the sun fell upon them their coats shone red as copper．The male has a pair of delicately turned horns．

Lulu became a member of my household in this way：

I drove one morning from the farm to Nairobi．My mill on the farm had burnt down a short time before，and I had had to drive into town many times to get the insurance settled and paid out；in this early morning I had my head filled with figures and estimates．As I came driving along the Ngong road a little group of Kikuyu children shouted to me from the roadside，and I saw that they were holding a very small bushbuck up for me to see．I knew that they would have found the fawn in the bush，and that now they wanted to sell it to me，but I was late for an appointment in Nairobi，and I had no thought for this sort of thing，so I drove on．

When I was coming back in the evening and was driving past the same place，there was again a great shout from the side of the road and the small party was still there，a little tired and disappointed，for they may have tried to sell the fawn to other people passing by in the course of the day，but keen now to get the deal through before the sun was down，and they held up the fawn high to tempt me．But I had had a long day in town，and some adversity about the insurance，so that I did not care to stop or talk，and I just drove on past them．I did not even think of them when I was back in my house，and dined and went to bed．

The moment that I had fallen asleep I was woken up again by a great feeling of terror．The picture of the boys and the small buck，which had now collected and taken shape，stood out before me，clearly，as if it had been painted，and I sat up in bed as appalled as if someone had been trying to choke me．What，I thought，would become of the fawn in the hands of the captors who had stood with it in the heat of the long day，and had held it up by its joined legs？It was surely too young to eat on its own．I myself had driven past it twice on the same day，like the priest and the Levite in one，and had given no thought to it，and now，at this moment，where was it？I got up in a real panic and woke up all my houseboys．I told them that the fawn must be found and brought me in the morning，or they would all of them get their dismissal from my service．They were immediately up to the idea．Two of my boys had been in the car with me the same day，and had not shown the slightest interest in the children or the fawn；now they came forward，and gave the others a long list of details of the place and the hour and of the family of the boys．It was a moonlight night；my people all took off and spread in the landscape in a lively discussion of the situation；I heard them expatiating on the fact that they were all to be dismissed in case the bushbuck were not found．

Early next morning when Farah brought me in my tea，Juma came in with him and carried the fawn in his arms．It was a female，and we named her Lulu，which I was told was the Swaheli word for a pearl．

Lulu by that time was only as big as a cat，with large quiet purple eyes．She had such delicate legs that you feared they would not bear being folded up and unfolded again，as she lay down and rose up．Her ears were smooth as silk and exceedingly expressive．Her nose was as black as a truffle．Her diminutive hoofs gave her all the air of a young Chinese lady of the old school，with laced feet．It was a rare experience to hold such a perfect thing in your hands．

Lulu soon adapted herself to the house and its inhabitants and behaved as if she were at home．During the first weeks the polished floors in the rooms were a problem in her life，and when she got outside the carpets her legs went away from her to all four sides；it looked catastrophic but she did not let it worry her much and in the end she learnt to walk on the bare floors with a sound like a succession of little angry finger-taps．She was extraordinarily neat in all her habits．She was headstrong already as a child，but when I stopped her from doing the things she wanted to do，she behaved as if she said：Anything rather than a scene．

Kamante brought her up on a sucking-bottle，and he also shut her up at night，for we had to be careful of her as the leopards were up round the house after nightfall．So she held to him and followed him about．From time to time when he did not do what she wanted，she gave his thin legs a hard butt with her young head，and she was so pretty that you could not help，when you looked upon the two together，seeing them as a new paradoxical illustration to the tale of the Beauty and the Beast．On the strength of this great beauty and gracefulness，Lulu obtained for herself a commanding position in the house，and was treated with respect by all．

In Africa I never had dogs of any other breed than the Scotch deerhound．There is no more noble or gracious kind of dog．They must have lived for many centuries with men to understand and fall in with our life and its conditions the way they do．You will also find them in old paintings and tapestries，and they have in themselves a tendency to change，by their looks and manners，their surroundings into tapestry；they bring with them a feudal atmosphere．

The first of my tribe of deerhounds，who was named Dusk，had been given to me as a wedding present，and had come out with me when I began my life in Africa，on The Mayflower，so to say．He was a gallant，generous character．He accompanied me when during the first months of the war，I did transport for the government，with ox-wagons in the Masai Reserve．But a couple of years later he was killed by zebra．By the time that Lulu came to live in my house I had two of his sons there．

The Scotch deerhound went well with African scenery and the African Native．It may be due to the altitude—the highland melody in all three—for he did not look so harmonious at sea-level in Mombasa．It was as if the great，spare landscape，with the plains，hills and rivers，was not complete until the deerhounds were also in it．All the deerhounds were great hunters and had more nose than the greyhounds，but they hunted by sight and it was a highly wonderful thing to see two of them working together．I took them with me when I was out riding in the Game Reserve，which I was not allowed to do，and there they would spread the herds of zebra and wildebeest over the plain，as if it were all the stars of heaven running wild over the sky．But when I was out in the Masai Reserve shooting I never lost a wounded head of game if I had the deerhounds with me．

They looked well in the native forests too，dark grey in the sombre green shades．One of them，in here，all by himself，killed a big old male baboon，and in the fight had his nose bitten straight through，which spoilt his noble profile but by everybody on the farm was considered an honourable scar，for the baboons are destructive beasts and the Natives detest them．

The deerhounds were very wise，and knew who amongst my houseboys were Mohammedans，and not allowed to touch dogs．

During my first years in Africa I had a Somali gunbearer named Ismail，who died while I was still out there．He was one of the old-time gunbearers，and there are no such people now．He had been brought up by the great old big-game hunters of the beginning of the century，when all Africa was a real deer-park．His acquaintance with civilization was entirely of the hunting fields，and he spoke an English of the hunting world，so that he would talk of my big and my young rifle．After Ismail had gone back to Somaliland，I had a letter from him which was addressed to Lioness Blixen，and opened：Honourable Lioness．Ismail was a strict Mohammedan，and would not for the life of him touch a dog，which caused him much worry in his profession．But he made an exception with Dusk and never minded my taking him with us in the mule-trap，he would even let Dusk sleep in his tent．For Dusk，he said，would know a Mohammedan when he saw him，and would never touch him．Indeed，Ismail assured me，Dusk could see at once who was a sincere Mohammedan at heart．He once said to me：“Iknow now that the Dusk is of the same tribe as you yourself．He laughs at the people．”

Now my dogs understood Lulu's power and position in the house．The arrogance of the great hunters was like water with her．She pushed them away from the milk-bowl and from their favourite places in front of the fire．I had tied a small bell on a rein round Lulu's neck，and there came a time when the dogs，when they heard the jingle of it approaching through the rooms，would get up resignedly from their warm beds by the fireplace，and go and lie down in some other part of the room．Still，nobody could be of a gentler demeanour than Lulu was when she came and lay down，in the manner of a perfect lady who demurely gathers her skirts about her and will be in no one's way．She drank the milk with a polite，pernickety mien，as if she had been pressed by an overkind hostess．She insisted on being scratched behind the ears，in a pretty forbearing way，like a young wife who pertly permits her husband a caress．

When Lulu grew up and stood in the flower of her young loveliness she was a slim delicately rounded doe，from her nose to her toes unbelievably beautiful．She looked like a minutely painted illustration to Heine's song of the wise and gentle gazelles by the flow of the river Ganges．

But Lulu was not really gentle，she had the so-called devil in her．She had，to the highest degree，the feminine trait of appearing to be exclusively on the defensive，concentrated on guarding the integrity of her being，when she was really，with every force in her，bent upon the offensive．Against whom？Against the whole world．Her moods grew beyond control or computation，and she would go for my horse，if he displeased her．I remembered old Hagenbeck in Hamburg，who had said that of all animal races，the carnivora included，the deer are the least to be relied on，and that you may trust a leopard，but if you trust a young stag，sooner or later he falls upon you in the rear．

Lulu was the pride of the house even when she behaved like a real shameless young coquette；but we did not make her happy．Sometimes she walked away from the house for hours，or for a whole afternoon．Sometimes when the spirit came upon her and her discontent with her surroundings reached a climax，she would perform，for the satisfaction of her own heart，on the lawn in front of the house，a war-dance，which looked like a brief zigzagged prayer to Satan．

“Oh Lulu，”I thought，“I know that you are marvelously strong and that you can leap higher than your own height．You are furious with us now，you wish that we were all dead，and indeed we should be so if you could be bothered to kill us．But the trouble is not as you think now，that we have put up obstacles too high for you to jump，and how could we possibly do that，you great leaper？It is that we have put up no obstacles at all．The great strength is in you，Lulu，and the obstacles are within you as well，and the thing is，that the fullness of time has not yet come．”

One evening Lulu did not come home and we looked out for her in vain for a week．This was a hard blow to us all．A clear note had gone out of the house and it seemed no better than other houses．I thought of the leopards by the river and one evening I talked about them to Kamante．

As usual he waited some time before he answered，to digest my lack of insight．It was not till a few days later that he approached me upon the matter．“You believe that Lulu is dead，Msabu，”he said．

I did not like to say so straight out，but I told him I was wondering why she did not come back．

“Lulu，”said Kamante，“is not dead．But she is married．”

This was pleasant，surprising news，and I asked him how he knew of it．

“Oh yes，”he said，“she is married．She lives in the forest with her bwana”—her husband，or master．“But she has not forgotten the people；most mornings she is coming back to the house．I lay out crushed maize to her at the back of the kitchen，then just before the sun comes up，she walks round there from the woods and eats it．Her husband is with her，but he is afraid of the people because he has never known them．He stands below the big white tree by the other side of the lawn．But up to the houses he dare not come．”

I told Kamante to come and fetch me when he next saw Lulu．A few days later before sunrise he came and called me out．

It was a lovely morning．The last stars withdrew while we were waiting，the sky was clear and serene but the world in which we walked was sombre still，and profoundly silent．The grass was wet；down by the trees where the ground sloped it gleamed with the dew like dim silver．The air of the morning was cold，it had that twinge in it which in northern countries means that the frost is not far away．However often you make the experience—I thought—it is still impossible to believe，in this coolness and shade，that the heat of the sun and the glare of the sky，in a few hours' time，will be hard to bear．The grey mist lay upon the hills，strangely taking shape from them；it would be bitterly cold on the buffalo if they were about there now，grazing on the hillside，as in a cloud．

The great vault over our heads was gradually filled with clarity like a glass with wine．Suddenly，gently，the summits of the hill caught the first sunlight and blushed．And slowly，as the earth leaned towards the sun，the grassy slopes at the foot of the mountain turned a delicate gold，and the Masai woods lower down．And now the tops of the tall trees in the forest，on our side of the river，blushed like copper．This was the hour for the flight of the big，purple wood-pigeons which roosted by the other side of the river and came over to feed on the Cape-chestnuts in my forest．They were here only for a short season in the year．The birds came surprisingly fast，like a cavalry attack of the air．For this reason the morning pigeon-shooting on the farm was popular with my friends in Nairobi；to be out by the house in time，just as the sun rose，they used to come out so early that they rounded my drive with the lamps of their cars still lighted．

Standing like this in the limpid shadow，looking up towards the golden heights and the clear sky，you would get the feeling that you were in reality walking along the bottom of the sea，with the currents running by you，and were gazing up towards the surface of the ocean．

A bird began to sing，and then I heard，a little way off in the forest，the tinkling of a bell．Yes，it was a joy，Lulu was back，and about in her old places！It came nearer，I could follow her movements by its rhythm；she was walking，stopping，walking on again．A turning round one of the boys' huts brought her upon us．It suddenly became an unusual and amusing thing to see a bushbuck so close to the house．She stood immovable now，she seemed to be prepared for the sight of Kamante，but not for that of me．But she did not make off，she looked at me without fear and without any remembrance of our skirmishes of the past or of her own ingratitude in running away without warning．

Lulu of the woods was a superior，independent being，a change of heart had come upon her，she was in possession．If I had happened to have known a young princess in exile，and while she was still a pretender to the throne，and had met her again in her full queenly estate after she had come into her rights，our meeting would have had the same character．Lulu showed no more meanness of heart than King Louis Philippe did，when he declared that the King of France did not remember the grudges of the Duke of Orleans．She was now the complete Lulu．The spirit of offensive had gone from her；for whom，and why，should she attack？She was standing quietly on her divine rights．She remembered me enough to feel that I was nothing to be afraid of．For a minute she gazed at me；her purple smoky eyes were absolutely without expression and did not wink，and I remembered that the Gods or Goddesses never wink，and felt that I was face to face with the ox-eyed Hera．She lightly nipped a leaf of grass as she passed me，made one pretty little leap，and walked on to the back of the kitchen，where Kamante had spread maize on the ground．

Kamante touched my arm with one finger and then pointed it towards the woods．As I followed the direction，I saw，under a tall Cape chestnut tree，a male bushbuck，a small tawny silhouette at the outskirts of the forest，with a fine pair of horns，immovable like a tree stem．Kamante observed him for some time，and then laughed．

“Look here now，”he said，“Lulu has explained to her husband that there is nothing up by the houses to be afraid of，but all the same he dares not come．Every morning he thinks that today he will come all the way，but，when he sees the house and the people，he gets a cold stone in the stomach”—this is a common thing in the Native world，and often gets in the way of the work on the farm—“and then he stops by the tree．”

For a long time Lulu came to the house in the early mornings．Her clear bell announced that the sun was up on the hills，I used to lie in bed，and wait for it．Sometimes she stayed away for a week or two，and we missed her and began to talk of the people who went to shoot in the hills．But then again my houseboys announced：“Lulu is here，”as if it had been the married daughter of the house on a visit．A few times more I also saw the bushbuck's silhouette amongst the trees，but Kamante had been right，and he never collected enough courage to come all the way to the house．

One day，as I came back from Nairobi，Kamante was keeping watch for me outside the kitchen door，and stepped forward，much excited，to tell me that Lulu had been to the farm the same day and had had her Toto—her baby—with her．Some days after，I myself had the honour to meet her amongst the boys' huts，much on the alert and not to be trifled with，with a very small fawn at her heels，as delicately tardive in his movements as Lulu herself had been when we first knew her．This was just after the long rains，and，during those summer months，Lulu was to be found near the houses，in the afternoon，as well as at daybreak．She would even be round there at midday，keeping in the shadow of the huts．

Lulu's fawn was not afraid of the dogs，and would let them sniff him all over，but he could not get used to the Natives or to me，and if we ever tried to get hold of him，the mother and the child were off．

Lulu herself would never，after her first long absence from the house，come so near to any of us that we could touch her．In other ways she was friendly；she understood that we wanted to look at her fawn，and she would take a piece of sugar cane from an outstretched hand．She walked up to the open dining room door，and gazed thoughtfully into the twilight of the rooms，but she never again crossed the threshold．She had by this time lost her bell，and came and went away in silence．

My houseboys suggested that I should let them catch Lulu's fawn，and keep him as we had once kept Lulu．But I thought it would make a boorish return to Lulu's elegant confidence in us．

It also seemed to me that the free union between my house and the antelope was a rare，honourable thing．Lulu came in from the wild world to show that we were on good terms with it，and she made my house one with the African landscape，so that nobody could tell where the one stopped and the other began．Lulu knew the place of the giant forest-hog's lair and had seen the rhino copulate．In Africa there is a cuckoo which sings in the middle of the hot days in the midst of the forest，like the sonorous heartbeat of the world，I had never had the luck to see her，neither had anyone that I knew，for nobody could tell me how she looked．But Lulu had perhaps walked on a narrow green deerpath just under the branch on which the cuckoo was sitting．I was then reading a book about the old great Empress of China，and of how after the birth of her son，young Yahanola came on a visit to her old home；she set forth from the Forbidden City in her golden，green-hung palanquin．My house，I thought，was now like the house of the young Empress's father and mother．

The two antelopes，the big and the small，were round by my house all that summer；sometimes there was an interval of a fortnight，or three weeks，between their visits，but at other times we saw them every day．In the beginning of the next rainy season my houseboys told me that Lulu had come back with a new fawn．I did not see the fawn for by this time they did not come up quite close to the house，but later I saw three bushbucks together in the forest．

The league between Lulu and her family and my house lasted for many years．The bushbucks were often in the neighbourhood of the house，they came out of the woods and went back again as if my grounds were a province of the wild country．They came mostly just before sunset，and first moved in amongst the trees like delicate dark silhouettes on the dark green，but when they stepped out to graze on the lawn in the light of the afternoon sun their coats shone like copper．One of them was Lulu，for she came up near to the house，and walked about sedately，pricking her ears when a car arrived，or when we opened a window；and the dogs would know her．She became darker in colour with age．Once I came driving up in front of my house with a friend and found three bushbucks on the terrace there，round the salt that was laid out for my cows．

It was a curious thing that apart from the first big bushbuck，Lulu's bwana，who had stood under the Cape chestnut with his head up，no male bushbuck was amongst the antelopes that came to my house．It seemed that we had to do with a forest matriarchy．

The hunters and naturalists of the colony took an interest in my bushbucks，and the game warden drove out to the farm to see them，and did see them there．A correspondent wrote about them in the East African Standard．

The years in which Lulu and her people came round to my house were the happiest of my life in Africa．For that reason，I came to look upon my acquaintance with the forest antelopes as upon a great boon，and a token of friendship from Africa．All the country was in it，good omens，old covenants，a song：

Make haste，my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountain of spices．

During my last years in Africa I saw less and less of Lulu and her family．Within the year before I went away I do not think that they ever came．Things had changed；south of my farm land had been given out to farmers and the forest had been cleared here，and houses built．Tractors were heaving up and down where the glades had been．Many of the new settlers were keen sportsmen and the rifles sang in the landscape．I believe that the game withdrew to the west and went into the woods of the Masai Reserve．

I do not know how long an antelope lives；probably Lulu has died a long time ago．

Often，very often，in the quiet hours of daybreak，I have dreamed that I have heard Lulu's clear bell，and in my sleep my heart has run full of joy，I have woken up expecting something very strange and sweet to happen，just now，in a moment．

When I have then lain and thought of Lulu，I have wondered if in her life in the woods she ever dreamed of the bell．Would there pass in her mind，like shadows upon water，pictures of people and dogs？

If I know a song of Africa—I thought—of the giraffe，and the African new moon lying on her back，of the ploughs in the fields，and the sweaty faces of the coffee-pickers，does Africa know a song of me？Would the air over the plain quiver with a colour that I had had on，or the children invent a game in which my name was，or the full moon throw a shadow over the gravel of the drive that was like me，or would the eagles of Ngong look out for me？

I have not heard from Lulu，since I went away，but from Kamante I have heard，and from my other houseboys in Africa．It is not more than a month since I had the last letter-from him．But these communications from Africa come to me in a strange，unreal way，and are more like shadows，or mirages，than like news of a reality．

For Kamante cannot write，and he does not know English．When he，or my other people，take it into their heads to send me their tidings，they go to one of the professional Indian or Native letter-writers who are sitting with their writing desk，paper，pen，and ink，outside the post offices，and explain to them what shall be in the letter．The professional writers do not know much English either，and can hardly be said to know how to write，but they themselves believe that they can．To show off their skill they enrich the letters with a number of flourishes，which makes them difficult to decipher．They have also a habit of writing the letters in three or four different kinds of ink，and，whatever their motive for this is，it gives the impression that they are short of ink and are squeezing the last drop out of a number of ink bottles．From all these efforts come the sort of messages that people got from the Oracle of Delphi．There is a depth in the letters that I get，you feel that there is some vital communication which has been heavy on the heart of the sender，which had made him walk in a long way from the Kikuyu Reserve to the post office．But it is wrapped up in darkness．The cheap and dirty little sheet of paper that，when it comes to you，has travelled many thousand miles，seems to speak and speak，even to scream to you，but it tells you nothing at all．

Kamante，however，in this as in most other ways，is different from other people．As a correspondent he has a manner of his own．He puts three or four letters into the same envelope，and has them marked：1st Letter，2nd Letter，and so on．They all contain the same things，repeated over and over．Perhaps he wants to make a deeper impression upon me by repetition，he had that way in talking when there was anything that he particularly wanted me to understand or remember．Perhaps it is difficult for him to break off when he feels that he has got into contact with a friend at such a great distance．

Kamante writes that he has been out of work for a long time．I was not surprised to hear of it，for he was really caviare to the general．I had educated a royal cook and left him in a new colony．It was with him a case of“open sesame．”Now the word has been lost，and the stone has closed for good round the mystic treasures that it had in it．Where the great chef walked in deep thought，full of knowledge，nobody sees anything but a little bandy-legged Kikuyu，a dwarf with a flat，still face．

What has Kamante got to say when he walks in to Nairobi，takes up his stand before the greedy supercilious Indian letter writer，and expounds to him a message that is to go round half the world？The lines are crooked and there is no order in the phrases of the letter．But Kamante had in him a greatness of soul of which the people who knew him will still hear the note in the cracked disordered music；even as an echo of the harp of the herdboy David．

This is a“2nd letter”：

“I was not forget you Memsahib．Honoured Memsahib．Now all your servants they never glad because you was from the country．If we was bird we fly and see you．Then we turn．Then your old farm it was good place for cow small calf black people．Now they had no anything cows goat sheep they has no anything．Now all bad people they enjoy in their heart because your old servant they come poor people now．Now God know in his heart all this to help sometime your servant．”

And in a“3rd letter”Kamante gives an example of the way in which the Native can say a handsome thing to you，he writes：

“Write and tell us if you turn．We think you turn．Because why？We think that you shall never can forget us．Because why？We think that you remembered still all our face and our mother names．”

A white man who wanted to say a pretty thing to you would write：“I can never forget you．”The African says：“We do not think of you，that you can ever forget us．”





A SHOOTING ACCIDENT ON THE FARM





The Shooting Accident


On the evening of the nineteenth of December，I walked out of my house before going to bed，to see if there was any rain coming．Many farmers in the highlands were，I believe，doing the same thing at that hour．Sometimes，in a lucky year，we would get a few heavy showers just round Christmas，and it was a great thing for the young coffee，which has set on the trees after the flowering in the short rains of October．This night there was no sign of rain．The sky was serene and silently triumphant，resplendent with stars．

The stellar heaven of the equator is richer than that of the north，and you see it more because you are out more at night．In northern Europe，winter nights are too cold to allow one much pleasure in the contemplation of the stars，and in summer one hardly distinguishes them within the clear night sky，that is as pale as a dog-violet．

The tropical night has the companionability of a Roman Catholic cathedral compared to the Protestant churches of the north，which let you in on business only．Here in the great room everybody comes and goes，this is the place where things are going on．To Arabia and Africa，where the sun of the midday kills you，night is the time for travelling and enterprise．The stars have been named here，they have been guides to human beings for many centuries，drawing them in long lines across the desert sands and the sea，one towards the east，and another to the west，or the north and south．Cars run well at night，and it is pleasant to motor under the stars，you get into the habit of fixing visits to friends up-country by the time of the next full moon．You start safaris by the new moon，to have the benefit of the whole row of moonlight nights．It is then strange，when back on a visit to Europe，to find your friends of the towns living out of touch with the moves of the moon and almost in ignorance of them．The young moon was the sign of action to Khadija's camel man，whose caravan was to start off when she appeared in the sky．With his face towards her he was one of the“philosophers who spin out of moonlight systems of the universe．”He must have looked at her much，that he made her his sign in which to conquer．

I had got a name amongst the Natives，because a number of times I had happened to be，on the farm，the first to see the new moon，like a thin silver bow in the sunset；particularly because，two or three years running，I had been the first to catch sight of the new moon of the month of Ramadan，the Mohammedan's holy month．

The farmer slowly turns his eyes all round the horizon．First to the east，for from the east，if it comes，comes the rain，and there stands clear Spica in the Virgin．Then south，to greet the Southern Cross，doorkeeper of the great world，faithful to travellers and beloved by them，and higher up，under the luminous streak of the Milky Way，Alpha and Beta in the Centaur．To the south-west sparkles Sirius，great in heaven，and the thoughtful Canopus，and to the west above the faint outline of the Ngong Hills，now nearly unbroken，the radiant diamond ornament，Rigel，Betelgeuze and Bellatrix．He turns to the north last，for to the north we go back in the end，and there he runs upon the Great Bear himself，only he is now calmly standing on his head on account of the heavenly perspective，and that has all the air of a bearish joke，that cheers the heart of the Nordic emigrant．

People who dream when they sleep at night know of a special kind of happiness which the world of the day holds not，a placid ecstasy，and ease of heart，that are like honey on the tongue．They also know that the real glory of dreams lies in their atmosphere of unlimited freedom．It is not the freedom of the dictator，who enforces his own will on the world，but the freedom of the artist，who has no will，who is free of will．The pleasure of the true dreamer does not lie in the substance of the dream，but in this：that there things happen without any interference from his side，and altogether outside his control．Great landscapes create themselves，long splendid views，rich and delicate colours，roads，houses，which he has never seen or heard of．Strangers appear and are friends or enemies，although the person who dreams has never done anything about them．The ideas of flight and pursuit are recurrent in dreams and are equally enrapturing．Excellent witty things are said by everybody．It is true that if remembered in the daytime they will fade and lose their sense，because they belong to a different plane，but as soon as the one who dreams lies down at night，the current is again closed and he remembers their excellency．All the time the feeling of immense freedom is surrounding him and running through him like air and light，an unearthly bliss．He is a privileged person，the one who has got nothing to do，but for whose enrichment and pleasure all things are brought together；the Kings of Tarshish shall bring gifts．He takes part in a great battle or ball，and wonders the while that he should be，in the midst of those events，so far privileged as to be lying down．It is when one begins to lose the consciousness of freedom，and when the idea of necessity enters the world at all，when there is any hurry or strain anywhere，a letter to be written or a train to catch，when you have got to work，to make the horses of the dream gallop，or to make the rifles go off，that the dream is declining that I declined，and turning into the nightmare，which belongs to the poorest and most vulgar class of dreams．

The thing which in the waking world comes nearest to a dream is night in a big town，where nobody knows one，or the African night．There too is infinite freedom：it is there that things are going on，destinies are made round you，there is activity to all sides，and it is none of your concern．

Here now，as soon as the sun was down the air was full of bats，cruising as noiselessly as cars upon asphalt，the nighthawk swept past too：the bird that sits on the road and in the eyes of which the lights of your car gleam red a moment before he flutters up vertically in front of your wheels．The little spring hares were out on the roads，moving in their own way，sitting down suddenly and jumping along to a rhythm，like miniature kangaroos．The cicada sing an endless song in the long grass，smells run along the earth and falling stars run over the sky，like tears over a cheek．You are the privileged person to whom everything is taken．The Kings of Tarshish shall bring gifts．

A few miles out，in the Masai Reserve，the zebra are now changing their pasture，the flocks wander over the grey plain like lighter stripes upon it，the buffalo are out grazing on the long slopes of the hills．My young men of the farm would come by，two or three together，walking one after the other like narrow dark shadows on the lawn，they were afoot and aiming straight at their own object，they were not working for me，and it was none of my concern．They themselves accentuated the position by just slackening their pace as they caught sight of my burning cigarette-end outside the house，and saluting without stopping．

“Jambo Msabu．”

“Jambo Morani”—young warriors—“where are you going？”

“We are going to Kathegu's manyatta．Kathegu has a big Ngoma on tonight．Good-bye，Msabu．”

If they walk together in bigger parties they will bring their own drum to the dance，and you hear it a long way away，like the throbbing of a small pulse in the finger of the night．And suddenly，to the ear that has not been listening for it，comes what is not so much a sound as a deep vibration of the air，the distant short roar of the lion．He is afoot，he is hunting，things are going on，out there where he is．It is not repeated，but it has widened the horizon；the long dungas and the waterhole are brought to you．




As I was standing before my house a shot fell，not far off．One shot．Then again the stillness of the night closed on all sides．After a while，as if they had been pausing to listen and were now taking it up once more，I heard the cicada chiming their monotonous little song in the grass．

There is something strangely determinate and fatal about a single shot in the night．It is as if someone had cried a message to you in one word，and would not repeat it．I stood for some time wondering what it had meant．Nobody could aim at anything at this hour，and，to scare away something，a person would fire two shots or more．

It might have been my old Indian carpenter Pooran Singh down at the mill，firing at a couple of hyena that had slunk into the millyard and were eating the straps of oxhide hung up there，with stones as weights to them，to be made into reins for our wagons．Pooran Singh was no hero，but he might have put the door of his hut ajar for the sake of his reins and blown off his old shotgun．Still he would have let off both barrels，and would probably have loaded and shot again，once he had tasted the sweetness of heroism．But one shot—and then silence？

I waited for some time for the second shot；nothing came，and as I looked again at the sky there was no rain coming either．So I went to bed，taking a book with me，and leaving the lamp to burn．In Africa，when you pick up a book worth reading，out of the deadly consignments which good ships are being made to carry out all the way from Europe，you read it as an author would like his book to be read，praying to God that he may have it in him to go on as beautifully as he has begun．Your mind runs，transported，upon a fresh deep green track．

Two minutes later a motor cycle rounded the drive at a terrific speed and stopped in front of the house，and someone knocked hard upon the long window of my sitting-room．I put on a skirt and a coat and a pair of shoes，took the lamp and went out．Outside was my mill-manager，wild-eyed and sweating in the lamplight．His name was Belknap，he was an American and an exceptionally capable，inspired mechanic，but of an uneven mind．With him things were either nearing the Millennium，or dark without a glimpse of hope．When he first came into my employ he had upset me by his varying views of life，and of prospects and conditions of the farm，as if he had had me up in an enormous mental swing；later I had got used to them．These ups and downs were no more than a kind of emotional daily gymnastics to a lively temperament，much in need of exercise，and to which too little was happening；it is a common phenomenon with energetic young white men in Africa，particularly with those who have spent their early life in towns．But here he came out of the hands of a tragedy，and was as yet undecided as to whether he should satiate his hungry soul by making the most of it，or escape from its grimness by making as little of it as possible，and in this dilemma he looked like a very young boy running for his life to announce a catastrophe；he stuttered as he spoke．In the end he made very little of it，for it held no part in it for him to play，and fate had let him down once more．

By this time，Farah had come from his house，and listened to his narrative with me．

Belknap told me how peacefully and pleasantly the tragedy had started．His cook had had a day off，and in his absence a party had been given in the kitchen by the seven-year-old kitchen-Toto，Kabero，a son of my old squatter and nearest neighbour on the farm，the old fox Kaninu．As，late in the evening，the company became very gay，Kabero had brought in his master's gun and，to his wild friends of the plains and shambas，had acted the part of a white man．Belknap was a keen poultry farmer：he made capons and poulardes and bought up pure-bred chicken at the Nairobi sales，and he kept a shotgun on his verandah to frighten away hawks and cerval-cats．When later we talked the case over，Belknap held that the gun had not been loaded，but that the children had looked up the cartridges and loaded it themselves，but here I think that his memory failed him，they could hardly have done it if they had wanted to，and it was more likely that the gun had for once been left loaded on the verandah．However it got there，the cartridge was in the barrel when Kabero，in the greatness of youth and popularity，aimed straight in amongst his guests and pulled the trigger．The shot had boomed through the house．Three of the children had been slightly wounded，and had fled from the kitchen in terror．Two were there now，badly hurt or dead．Belknap finished his tale by a long anathema of the continent of Africa and of the things that happen there．

While he talked，my houseboys had come out，very silent；they went in again，and brought out a hurricane-lamp．We got out dressing and disinfectant．It would be a waste of time to try to start the car，and we ran as quick as we could through the forest down to Belknap's house．The swinging hurricane-lamp threw our shadows from the one side of the narrow road to the other．As we ran on，we were met by a succession of short raw cracked shrieks—death squeals of a child．

The kitchen door was flung back，as if Death，after having rushed in，had rushed out again，and left the place in dire devastation，a chicken-house that the badger has been in．There was a kitchen lamp burning on the table and smoking sky-high，and in the small room the smell of gunpowder still hung．The gun was on the table beside the lamp．There was blood all over the kitchen：I slipped in it on the floor．Hurricane-lamps are difficult to direct on to any particular spot，but they give a very striking illumination of a whole room or situation；I remember the things I have seen by the light of a hurricane-lamp better than others．

I knew the children who had been shot，from the plains of the farm，where they had herded their fathers' sheep．Wamai，Jogona's son，a lively little boy who had for some time been a pupil at the school，was lying on the floor between the door and the table．He was not dead，but not far from death，and unconscious even though he groaned a little．We lifted him aside，to be able to move．The child that shrieked was Wanyangerri，who had been the youngest of the party in the kitchen．He was sitting up，leaning forwards，towards the lamp；the blood spouted，like water from a pump，from his face—if one could still say that，for he must have stood straight in front of the barrel when it was fired and it had taken his lower jaw clean off．He held his arms out from his sides and moved them up and down like pump-spears，as the wings of a chicken go，after it has had its head cut off．

When you are brought suddenly within the presence of such disaster，there seems to be but one advice—it is the remedy of the shooting-field and the farmyard：that you should kill quickly and at any cost．And yet you know that you cannot kill，and your brain turns with fear．I put my hands to the child's head and pressed it in my despair，and，as if I had really killed him，he at the same moment stopped screaming，and sat erect with his arms hanging down，as if he was made of wood．So now I know what it feels like to heal by imposition of hands．

It is a difficult thing to bandage a patient whose face is half shot off，in your endeavour to stop the bleeding you may choke him．I had to lift the little boy on to Farah's knee，and made Farah hold his head in position for me，for if it fell forward I could not get the dressing fastened，and if it fell back the blood ran down and filled his throat．In the end，while he sat so still，I got the bandages placed．

We lifted Wamai on to the table and held the lamp up to look at him．He had received the full charge of the gun into his throat and chest．He did not bleed much，only a thin trail of blood ran down from the corner of his mouth．It was surprising to see this Native child，who had been as full of life as a fawn，so quiet now．While we looked at him his own face changed and took on an expression of deep surprise．I sent Farah to the house to fetch the car，for we had no time to waste in bringing the children into hospital．

While we waited I inquired after Kabero，the boy who had fired the gun and shed all this blood．Belknap then told me a queer story about him．A couple of days earlier Kabero had bought an old pair of shorts from his master，and was to pay him with a rupee from his wages．When the shot fell，and Belknap ran out to the kitchen，Kabero was standing in the middle of the room with the smoking gun in his hand．He stared at Belknap for a second，and then dived into the pocket of the very shorts that he had so newly bought and had put on for the party，drew up a rupee and laid it on the table with his left hand，while with his right he threw the gun also on the table．And in that final settlement with the world he was gone；he actually，although we did not know of it at the moment，in this great gesture，disappeared from the face of the earth．It was an unusual behaviour in a Native，for they generally manage to keep a debt，and in particular a debt to a white man，within the outskirts of their mind．Perhaps the moment to Kabero had looked so much like the day of judgment，that he felt he had got to play up to it；perhaps he was trying，in the hour of need，to secure a friend．Or the shock，the boom，and the death of his friends round him，had knocked in the whole of the boy's small sphere of ideas，so that bits of the periphery had been flung into the very centre of his consciousness．

At that time I had an old Overland car．I shall never write anything against her，for she served me well through many years．But it was rare that she could be induced to run on more than two cylinders．Her lights were out of order too，so that I used to drive in to dances at the Muthaiga Club with a hurricane lamp swaddled in a red silk handkerchief，for a back light．She had to be pushed into starting，and upon this night it took a long time．

Visitors to my house had been complaining of the state of my road，and during the death-drive of that night I realized that they had been right．I first let Farah drive，but I thought that he was deliberately going into all the deep holes and wagon tracks of the road，and I took the steering-wheel myself．For this I had to get off by the pond to wash my hands in the dark water．The distance to Nairobi seemed infinitely long，I thought that I might have driven home to Denmark in the time that it took us．

The Native hospital of Nairobi lies on the hill just before you drive down into the cup of the town．It was dark now，and seemed peaceful．We had much trouble to wake it up；in the end we got hold of an old Goan doctor or doctor's assistant，who appeared in a queer sort of negligée．He was a big fat man of a very placid manner，and had a strange way of making the same gesture first with one hand and then with the other．As I helped to lift Wamai out of the car I thought that he stirred and stretched himself a little，but when we brought him into the brightly lighted room in the hospital，he was dead．The old Goan kept waving his hand at him，saying：“He is dead．”And then again at Wanyangerri，saying：“He is alive．”I never saw this old man again，for I never came back to the hospital at night，which was probably his hour there．At the time，I thought his manner very annoying，but afterwards I felt as if Fate itself in a number of big white cloaks，the one on the top of the other，had met us at the threshold of the house，dealing out life and death impartially．

Wanyangerri woke up from his trance when we took him into the hospital，and at once got into a terrible panic；he would not be left but clung to me and to anybody near him and cried and wept in the greatest anguish．The old Goan in the end calmed him by some injection，looked at me over his spectacles and said：“He is alive．”I left the children there，the dead and the live，upon two stretchers，for their different fates．

Belknap，who had come in with us on his motor bicycle，mostly so as to help us to push the car into starting，should she stop on the road，now thought that we ought to report the accident to the police．So we drove down into town to the River Road Police Station，and thereby ran straight into the night-life of Nairobi．There was no white police officer present when we came，and while they sent for him we waited outside in the car．The street had an avenue of tall eucalyptus trees，the tree of all pioneer-towns of the highlands；at night their very long narrow leaves give out a queer pleasant smell，and look strange in the light of the street-lamps．A big buxom young Swaheli woman was carried into the police station by a group of Native policemen，she resisted with all her might，scratched their faces，and screamed like a pig．A party of brawlers were brought in，still eager，upon the steps of the station，to go for one another；and a thief，I believe，who had just been caught，came down the street with a whole tail of night revellers after him，who were taking his part，or the part of the police，and were loudly debating the case．In the end a young police officer arrived，straight，I believe，from a gay party．He was a disappointment to Belknap，for he began to take down his report with the keenest interest and at a terrific speed，but then fell into deep thoughts，dragged his pencil slowly over the page and finally gave up writing and put his pencil back into his pocket．I was cold in the night air．At last we could drive home．

While I was still in bed the next morning，I felt，by the concentrated stillness outside the house，that there were many people about it．I knew who they were：the old men of the farm，squatting upon the stones，munching，sniffing their tobacco，spitting，and whispering．I also knew what they wanted：they had come to inform me that they wished to set a Kyama on the case of the shot of last night，and of the death of the children．

A Kyama is an assembly of the Elders of a farm，which is authorized by the Government to settle the local differences amongst the squatters．The members of the Kyama gather round a crime，or an accident，and will sit over it for many weeks，battening upon mutton，talk，and disaster．I knew that now the old men would want to talk the whole matter over with me，and also that they would，if they could，in the end make me come into their court to give the final judgment in the case．I did not want to take up an endless discussion of the tragedy of the night，at this moment，and sent for my horse to get out and away from them．

As I came out from the house I found，as I expected，the whole circle of the Ancients to the left of it，near the boys' huts．For the sake of their own dignity as an assembly they pretended not to see me，until they realized that I was going away．They then stumbled on to their old legs in great haste，and began to flap their arms at me．I waved my hand to them in return，and rode off．





Riding in the Reserve


I rode into the Masai Reserve．I had to cross the river to get there；riding on，I got into the Game Reserve in a quarter of an hour．It had taken me some time，while I had lived on the farm，to find a place where I could get over the river on horseback：the descent was stony，and the slope up the other side very steep，but“once in—how the delighted spirit pants for joy”．

Here lay before you a hundred miles' gallop over grass and open undulating land；there was not a fence nor a ditch，and no road．There was no human habitation except the Masai villages，and those were deserted half the year，when the great wanderers took themselves and their herds off to other pastures．There were low thorn trees regularly spread over the plain，and long deep valleys with dry river-beds of big flat stones，where you had to find a deer path here and there to take you across．After a little while you became aware of how still it was out here．I made a verse about it：

Across the plain the long grass run，before the blowing weather，

In loneliness the plain，the wind，the heart，play together．



Now，looking back on my life in Africa，I feel that it might altogether be described as the existence of a person who had come from a rushed and noisy world，into a still country．

A little before the rains，the Masai burn off the old dry grass，and while the plains are thus lying black and waste they are unpleasant to travel on：you will get the black charred dust，which the hoofs of your horse raise，all over you and into your eyes，and the burnt grass-stalks are sharp as glass；your dogs get their feet cut on them．But when the rains come，and the young green grass is fresh on the plains，you feel as if riding upon springs，and the horse gets a little mad with the pleasantness．The various kinds of gazelles come to the green places to graze，and there look like toy animals stood upon a billiard table．You may ride into a herd of eland；the mighty peaceful beasts will let you get close to them before they start trotting off，their long horns streaming backwards over their raised necks，the large loose flaps of breastskin，that make them look square，swaying as they jog．They seem to have come out of an old Egyptian epitaph，but there they have been ploughing the fields，which gives them a familiar and domesticated air．The giraffe keep farther away in the Reserve．

At times，in the first month of the rains，a sort of wild white fragrant pink flowers so richly all over the Reserve that at a distance the plains look patched with snow．

I turned to the animal world from the world of men；my heart was heavy with the tragedy of the night．The old men sitting at my house made me uneasy；in old times people must have had that feeling when they thought it likely that a witch of the neighbourhood had fixed her mind upon them，or was at the very moment carrying a wax-child under her clothes，to be baptized with their own name．

My relations with the Natives in the legal affairs of the farm were altogether of a queer nature．Since，before anything，I wanted peace on the land，I could not keep out of them，for a dispute between the squatters，which has not been solemnly settled，was like those sores that you get in Africa，and which they there call veldt-sores：they heal on the surface if you let them，and go on festering and running underneath until you dig them up to the bottom and have them cleaned all through．The Natives themselves were aware of this，and if they really wanted a matter settled they would ask me to give judgment．

As I knew nothing of their laws the figure that I cut at these great courts of justice would often be that of a prima donna who does not remember a word of her part and has to be prompted through it by the rest of the cast．This task my old men took upon themselves with tact and patience．It would also at times be the figure of an affronted prima donna who is shocked by her rôle and，refusing to go on with it，walks off the stage．When this happened，my audience took it as a hard blow from the hand of destiny，an act of God outside their understanding；they looked on it in silence and spat．

The ideas of justice of Europe and Africa are not the same and those of the one world are unbearable to the other．To the African there is but one way of counter-balancing the catastrophes of existence，it shall be done by replacement；he does not look for the motive of an action．Whether you lie in wait for your enemy and cut his throat in the dark；or you fell a tree，and a thoughtless stranger passes by and is killed：so far as punishment goes，to the Native mind，it is the same thing．A loss has been brought upon the community and must be made up for，somewhere，by somebody．The Native will not give time or thought to the weighing up of guilt or desert：either he fears that this may lead him too far，or he reasons that such things are no concern of his．But he will devote himself，in endless speculations，to the method by which crime or disaster shall be weighed up in sheep and goats—time does not count to him；he leads you solemnly into a sacred maze of sophistry．In those days this went against my ideas of justice．

All Africans are the same in these rites．The Somali have a very different mentality from the Kikuyu and a deep contempt for them，but they will sit down in identical manner to weigh up murder，rape，or fraud against their stock at home in Somaliland—dearly beloved she camels，and horses，the names and pedigree of which are written in their hearts．

Once the news came to Nairobi of how Farah's little brother，who was ten years old，in a place called Buramur，had taken up a stone and thrown it at a boy of a different tribe，knocking out two of his teeth．Over this matter representatives of the two tribes met at the farm to sit upon the floor of Farah's house and talk，night after night．Old lean men came，who had been to Mekka and wore a green turban，arrogant young Somalis who，when they were not attending to really serious matters，were gunbearers to the great European travellers and hunters，and dark-eyed，round faced boys，who were shyly representing their family and who did not say a word，but were devoutly listening and learning．Farah told me that the matter was considered so grave because the boy's looks had been ruined：he might find it difficult，when his time came，to get married，and would have to come down in his pretentions as to birth or beauty in his bride．In the end the penance was fixed at fifty camels，which means half waregilt，full waregilt being one hundred camels．Fifty camels were then bought，far away in Somaliland，to be，ten years hence，laid on to the price of a Somali maiden，and to turn her eyes off the two missing teeth of her bridegroom；perhaps the foundation of a tragedy was laid．Farah himself considered that he had got off lightly．

The Natives of the farm never realized my views on their legal systems，and they came to me first of all for their indemnification when any ill-luck befell them．

Once，in the coffee-picking season，a young Kikuyu girl named Wamboi was run over by a bullock cart outside my house and killed．The carts were taking coffee from the field to the mill，and I had forbidden anybody to go riding on them．Otherwise I should have had at every trip a party of gay coffee-picking girls and children taking a slow joy-ride—for anybody can walk quicker than a bullock—all across the farm，and it would be too heavy on my bullocks．The young drivers，however，did not have it in them to send away the dreamy-eyed girls who kept running alongside their carts and begging for this great pleasure；all they could do was to tell them to jump off where the road came into sight of my house．But Wamboi fell as she jumped and the wheel of the cart went over her small dark head and broke the skull；a little blood trailed in the cart-track．

I sent for her old father and mother，who came in from the picking-field and wailed over her．I knew that this would also mean a heavy loss to them，for the girl had been of marriage-age，and would have brought them in her price of sheep and goats and a heifer or two．This they had been looking forward to since her birth．I was considering how much I ought to help them，when they forestalled me by turning upon me，with great energy，their claim for a full indemnification．

No，I said，I would not pay．I had told the girls of the farm that I would not have them riding on the carts，all people were aware of that．The old people nodded，there was nothing here with which they did not agree，but they stuck to their claim immovably．Their argument was that somebody must pay．They could get no contradiction to the principle into their heads，no more than they could have got the theory of relativity in there．And it was not greed or spite which，when I broke off the discussion and went back，made them follow at my heels；it was，as if I had been indeed magnetic，a law of nature．

They sat down and waited outside my house．They were poor people，small and underfed；they looked like a pair of little badgers on my lawn．They sat there till the sun was down and I could hardly distinguish them against the grass．They were sunk in deep grief；their bereavement and their economic loss melted into one overwhelming distress．Farah was away for the day；in his absence，at the time when the lamps were lighted in my house，I sent them out money to buy a sheep to eat．It was a bad move，they took it as the first sign of exhaustion in a besieged city and sat down for the night．I do not know if they would have had it in them to go away，if it had not been that，late in the evening，they conceived the idea of running in the young cart-driver for their damage．The idea lifted them off the grass and away，suddenly，without a word，and took them early next morning to Dagoretti，where our Assistant District Commissioner lived．

It brought upon the farm a long murder case and many swaggering young Native policemen．But all that the A．D．C．offered to do for them was to have the driver hanged for murder，and even that he gave up when he had got the evidence in the case，and the Ancients would not hold a Kyama upon the matter after both he and I had turned it away．So in the end the old people had to sit down under a law of relativity of which they did not understand a word，as other people have had to do．

At times I grew tired of my Ancients of the Kyama and told them what I thought of them—“You old men，”I said，“are fining the young men in order that it shall be impossible to them to collect any money for themselves．The young men cannot move for you，and then you buy up all the girls yourselves．”The old men listened attentively，the small black eyes in their dry and wrinkled faces glittered，their thin lips moved gently as if they were repeating my words：they were pleased to hear，for once，an excellent principle put into speech．

With all our diversities of views，my position as a judge to the Kikuyu held a profusion of potentialities，and was dear to me．I was young then，and had meditated upon the ideas of justice and injustice，but mostly from the angle of the person who is being judged；in a judge's seat I had not been．I took great trouble to judge rightly，and for peace on the farm．At times，when the problems became difficult，I had to retire and take time to think them over，covering my head with a mental cloak so that nobody should come and talk to me about them．This was always an effective move with the people of the farm，and I heard them，a long time afterwards，talk with respect of the case that had been so deep that no one could look through it in less than a week．One can always impress a Native by wasting more time over a matter than he does himself，only it is a difficult thing to accomplish．

But that the Natives should want me for a judge，and that they should consider my verdict of value to them，of this the explanation is found in their mythological or theological mentality．The Europeans have lost the faculty for building up myths or dogma，and for what we want of these we are dependent upon the supplies of our past．But the mind of the African moves naturally and easily upon such deep and shadowy paths．This gift of theirs comes out strongly in their relations with white people．

You find it already in the names which they deal out to the Europeans with whom they come in contact，after a very short acquaintance．You have got to know these names if you are to send a runner with letters to a friend，or find the way in a car to his house，for the Native world knows him by no other name．I have had an unsociable neighbour，who would never entertain a guest in his house，who was named Sahane Modja—One Cover．My Swedish friend Eric Otter was Resase Modja—One Cartridge—which meant that he did not need more than one single cartridge to kill，and which was a fine name to be known by．There was a keen automobilist of my acquaintance，who was called“Half man—half car．”When Natives name white men after animals—the fish，the giraffe，the fat bull—their minds run upon the lines of the old fables，and these white men，I believe，in their dark consciousness figure as both men and beasts．

And there is magic in words：a person who has for many years been known to all his surroundings by the name of an animal in the end comes to feel familiar with and related to the animal，he recognises himself in it．When he is back in Europe it is strange to him to feel that no one ever connects him with it．

Once，in the London Zoo，I saw again an old retired government official，whom in Africa I had known as Bwana Tembu—Mr．Elephant．He was standing，all by himself，before the elephant-house，sunk in deep contemplation of the elephants．Perhaps he would go there often．His Native servants would have thought it in the order of things that he should be there，but probably no one in all London，except I who was there only for a few days，would have quite understood him．

The Native mind works in strange ways，and is related to the mind of bygone people，who naturally imagined that Odin，so as to see through the whole world，gave away one of his eyes；and who figured the God of love as a child，ignorant of love．It is likely that the Kikuyu of the farm saw my greatness as a judge in the fact that I knew nothing whatever of the laws according to which I judged．

Because of their gift for myths，the Natives can also do things to you against which you cannot guard yourself and from which you cannot escape．They can turn you into a symbol．I was well aware of the process，and for my own use I had a word for it—in my mind I called it that they were brazen-serpenting me．Europeans who have lived for a long time with Natives will understand what I mean，even if the word is not quite correctly used according to the Bible．I believe that in spite of all our activities in the land，of the scientific and mechanical progress there，and of Pax Britannica itself，this is the only practical use that the Natives have ever had out of us．

They could not make use of all white men for the purpose，and not of one man and another equally．They gave us，within their world，precedence of rank according to our utility to them as brazen-serpents．Many of my friends—Denys Finch-Hatton，both Galbraith and Berkeley Cole，Sir Northrup MacMillan—ranked highly with the Natives in this capacity．

Lord Delamere was a brazen-serpent of the first magnitude．I remember that I once travelled in the highlands at the time when the great pest of hoppers came on to the land．The grasshoppers had been there the year before，now their small black offspring appeared，to eat what they had left，and to leave not a leaf of grass where they had passed．To the Natives this was a terrible blow；after what they had gone through it was too much for them to bear．Their hearts broke，they panted，or howled like dying dogs，they ran their heads against a wall in the air before them．I then happened to tell them how I had driven through Delamere's farm and had seen the hoppers on it，all over the place，in his paddocks and on his grazing land，and I added that Delamere had been in great rage and despair about them．At that same moment the listeners became quiet and almost at ease．They asked me what Delamere had said of his misfortune，and again asked me to repeat it，and then they said no more．

I did not，as a brazen-serpent，carry the weight of Lord Delamere，still there were occasions when I came in useful to the Natives．

During the war，when the fate of the Carrier Corps lay upon the whole Native world，the squatters of the farm used to come and sit round my house．They did not speak，not even amongst themselves，they turned their eyes upon me and made me their brazen-serpent．I could not very well chase them away，seeing that they did no harm，and besides，if I had done so they would have gone and sat down in some other place．It was a singularly hard thing to bear．I was helped through with it by the fact that my brother's regiment was at that time sent on to the foremost trenches at Vimy Ridge：I could turn my eyes upon him and make him my brazen-serpent．

The Kikuyu made me a chief mourner，or woman of sorrows，when a great distress befell us on the farm．It was what would happen now over the shooting accident．Because I grieved for the children，the people of the farm found it in them to lay the matter aside，and let it rest there for the time being．In regard to our misfortunes they looked upon me as the congregation looks upon the priest who empties the cup alone，but on their behalf．

There is this about witchcraft，that when it has once been practised on you，you will never completely rid yourself of it．I thought it a painful，a very painful process to be hung upon the pole，I wished that I could have escaped it．Still，many years after，there will be occasions when you find yourself thinking：“Am I to be treated in such a way？—I，who have been a brazen-serpent！”

As I was riding back to the farm，on crossing the river and actually in the water，I met a party of Kaninu's sons，three young men and a boy．They carried spears and came along quickly．When I stopped them and asked for news of their brother Kabero they stood，the water half-way to their knees，with still set faces and downcast eyes；they spoke slowly．Kabero，they said，had not come back，and nothing had been heard of him since he had run away last night．They were now certain that he was dead．He would either have killed himself in his despair—since the idea of suicide comes very naturaly to all Natives，and even to Native children—or he had been lost in the bush and the wild animals had eaten him．His brothers had been round looking for him in all directions；they were now on their way out into the Reserve to try to find him there．

When I came up the river bank on my own land，I turned and looked out over the plain；my land was higher up than the land of the Reserve．There was no sign of life anywhere on the plain，except that a long way out the zebra were grazing and galloping about．As the party of searchers emerged from the bush on the other side of the river，they went on quickly，walking one by one；their small group looked like a short caterpillar rapidly winding its way along on the grass．At times the sun glinted on their weapons．They seemed fairly confident of their direction，but what would it be？In their search for the lost child，their only guide would be the vultures that are always hanging in the sky above a dead body on the plain，and will give you the exact spot of a lion-kill．

But this would be only a very small body，not much of a feast for the gluttons of the air，there would not be many of them to spot it，nor would they be staying on for a very long time．

All this was sad to think of．I rode home．





Wamai


I went to the Kyama followed by Farah．I always had Farah with me in my dealings with the Kikuyu，for while he showed but little sense where his own quarrels were concerned，and like all Somalis would lose his head altogether wherever his tribal feelings and feuds came in，about other people's differences he had wisdom and discretion．He was，besides，my interpreter，for he spoke Swaheli very well．

I knew before I arrived at the assembly that the chief object of the proceeding would now be to shear Kaninu as close as possible．He would see his sheep driven away to all sides，some to indemnify the families of the dead and wounded children，some to maintain the Kyama．From the beginning this went against me．For Kaninu，I thought，had lost his son just as the other fathers，and the fate of his child seemed to me the most tragic of the lot．Wamai was dead and out of it，and Wanyangerri was in hospital，where people were looking after him，but Kabero had been abandoned by all，and nobody knew where his bones lay．

Now Kaninu lent himself exceptionally well to his rôle of the ox，fattened for a feast．He was one of my biggest squatters；on my squatter-list he is down for thirty-five head of cattle，five wives and sixty goats．His village was close to my wood：I therefore saw much of his children and his goats，and continually had to run in his women for cutting down my big trees．The Kikuyu know nothing of luxury：the richest amongst them live as the poor，and if I went into Kaninu's hut I would find nothing there in the way of furniture except perhaps a small wooden stool to sit on．But there were a number of huts at Kaninu's village，and a lively swarming of old women，young people and children round them．And a long row of cattle，about milking time at sunset，advanced towards the village across the plains，with their blue shadows walking gently on the grass beside them．All this gave to the old lean man in the leather mantle，with the net of fine wrinkles in his dark，shrewd face all filled up with dirt，the orthodox halo of a nabob of the farm．

I and Kaninu had had many heated arguments，I had indeed been threatening to turn him off the farm，all over a particular traffic of his．Kaninu was on good terms with the neighbouring Masai tribe，and had married four or five of his daughters off to them．The Kikuyu themselves told me how in the old times the Masai had thought it beneath them to intermarry with Kikuyu．But in our days the strange dying nation，to delay its final disappearance，has had to come down in its pride；the Masai women have no children and the prolific young Kikuyu girls are in demand with the tribe．All Kaninu's offspring were good-looking people，and he had brought back a number of sleek romping young heifers across the border of the Reserve in exchange for his young daughters．More than one old Kikuyu pater-familias in this period became rich in the same way．The big Chief of the Kikuyu，Kinanjui，had sent，I was told，more than twenty of his daughters to the Masai，and had got over a hundred head of cattle back from them．

But a year ago，the Masai Reserve had been put into quarantine for foot-and-mouth disease，and no stock could be taken out of it．Here was a grave dilemma in the existence of Kaninu．For the Masai are wanderers，and change their abode according to season，rain，and grazing，and those cows in their herds which lawfully belonged to Kaninu were dragged all over the land and would at times be a hundred miles away，where nobody knew what was happening to them．The Masai are unscrupulous cattle-dealers with anyone，and more so with the Kikuyu whom they despise．They are fine warriors and are said to be great lovers．In their hands the hearts of Kaninu's daughters were turning like the hearts of the Sabinewomen of old，and he could no longer rely on them．Therefore the resourceful old Kikuyu took to having his cattle shifted at night，when the District Commissioner and the Veterinary Department were supposed to be asleep，over the water to my farm．This was real villainous behaviour on his part，for the quarantine regulations are amongst those which the Natives understand；they think highly of them．Had these cows been found on my land，the farm itself would have been put into quarantine．I therefore set out watchmen down by the river to catch Kaninu's retainers，and on moonlight nights there had been many great dramatic ambuscades，and swift flights along the silver stream，and the heifers，upon which the whole concern turned，stampeded and ran away in all directions．

Jogona，the father of the child Wamai，who had been killed，was，on the other hand，a poor man．He had but one old wife，and all he owned in the world were three goats．He was not likely to make more，for he was a very simple person．I knew Jogona well．A year before the accident，and the sitting of the Kyama，a terrible murder had taken place on the farm．Two Indians who were leasing a mill from me a little way higher up the river，and were grinding mealie to the Kikuyu，had been killed in the night，their goods had been stolen，and the murderers were never found．The murder scared off all the Indian traders and storekeepers of the district，as if they had been blown away by a storm；I had had to arm Pooran Singh down at my own mill with an old shotgun to make him stay on，and even at that it had taken much persuasion．I myself had thought，the first nights after the murder，that I heard footsteps round the house，so for a week I had kept a night watchman there，and this man was Jogona．He was very gentle，and would have been of no use against murderers，but he was a friendly old man and pleasant to talk with．He had the manners of a gay child，his broad face wore an inspired and keen expression，whenever he looked at me he laughed．He now seemed very pleased to see me at the Kyama．

But the Koran itself，which I was studying in those days，says：“Thou shalt not bend the justice of the law for the benefit of the poor．”

Besides myself，at least one member of the assembly was aware that its purpose was now the flaying of Kaninu：this was Kaninu himself．The other old men sat around，infinitely attentive，and with all their wits collected for the proceedings．Kaninu，on the ground，had drawn his big cloak of goatskin over his head；from time to time he gave out under it a whine or whimper，like that of a dog which is exhausted by howling and is just keeping its misery alive．

The old men wanted to begin with the case of the wounded child Wanyangerri，because it gave them endless opportunity for palaver．What was the indemnification to be if Wanyangerri were dead？If he were disfigured？If he had lost the faculty of speech？Farah，on my behalf，told them that I would not discuss this matter until I had been in Nairobi and had seen the doctor of the hospital．They swallowed their disappointment and got their arguments on the next case ready．

It was up to the Kyama，I told them through Farah，to get this case settled quickly，and they should not sit over it for the rest of their lives．It was clear that it was not a murder case，but a bad accident．

The Kyama honoured my speech with their attention，but as soon as it was finished they opposed it．

“Msabu，we know nothing，”they said．“But here we see that you do not know enough either，and we understand only a little of what you say to us．It was Kaninu's son who fired the shot．Otherwise how would he be the only one not hurt by it？If you want to hear more about it Mauge here will tell you．His son was there and had one of his ears shot off．”

Mauge was one of the wealthiest squatters，a sort of rival of the farm to Kaninu．He was a very stately man to look at，and his words had weight，although he spoke very slowly and from time to time had to stop and think．“Msabu，”he said．“My son told me：the boys all held the gun the one after the other and pointed it at Kabero．But he would not explain to them how to shoot with it，no he would not explain it at all．In the end he took the gun back，and at the same moment it shot，it wounded all the children and killed Wamai，Jogona's son．This is exactly how it happened．”

“I knew all that already，”I said，“and it is what is called bad luck，and an accident．I might have fired the shot from my house，or you，Mauge，from yours．”

This created a great stir in the Kyama．They all looked at Mauge，who became very uneasy．Then they talked for some time amongst themselves，very lowly，as in a whisper．At last they took up the discussion again．“Msabu，”they said，“this time we do not understand one word of what you are saying．We can only believe that you are thinking of a rifle，since you yourself shoot so well with a rifle，but not so well with a shotgun．If it had been a rifle you would have been quite right．But nobody could shoot with a shotgun from your house，or from Mauge's house，down to the house of Bwana Menanya，and kill people within the house．”

After a short pause I said：“Everybody now knows that it was Kaninu's son who fired the gun．Kaninu will pay Jogona a number of sheep to make up for the loss．But everybody also knows that Kaninu's son was not a bad child and did not mean to kill Wamai，and that Kaninu will not pay as many sheep as if that had been the case．”

Here an old man by the name of Awaru spoke．He was in closer contact with civilization than the others，for he had been seven years in jail．

“Msabu，”he said，“you say that Kaninu's son was not bad and that therefore Kaninu will not pay out very many sheep．But if his son had wanted to kill Wamai and had thus been a very bad child，would that have been a good thing to Kaninu？Would he have been so pleased about that，that he would have paid many more sheep？”

“Awaru，”I said，“you know that Kaninu has lost his son．You go to the school yourself，so you know that this boy was clever at school．If he was as good in all other ways，it is a very bad thing to Kaninu to lose him．”

There was a long pause，not a sound in the ring．At the end of it Kaninu，as if suddenly reminded of a forgotten pain or duty，gave out a long wail．

“Memsahib，”said Farah，“let these Kikuyu now name the figure that they have in their hearts．”He spoke in Swaheli to me，so that the assembly should understand him，and succeeded in making them ill at ease，for a figure is a concrete thing，which no Native likes to give out．Farah let his eyes run all round the circle and in a haughty way suggested：“One hundred．”A hundred sheep was a fantastic number，which nobody would seriously have thought of．A silence fell upon the Kyama．The old men felt themselves at the mercy of Somali mockery，and chose to lie low under it．A very old man whispered“Fifty”but the figure seemed to carry no weight but to be blown aloft in the current of air of Farah's joke．

After a moment Farah himself briskly said“Forty”in the manner of the experienced cattle-trader，at home with figures and stock．The word set astir the latent ideas of the meeting；they began to talk very lively amongst themselves．They would now need time，and would meditate and cackle much，but all the same a basis for negotiations had been laid．When we were at home again Farah said to me confidently：“I think that these old men will take forty sheep from Kaninu．”

Kaninu at the Kyama had one more ordeal to go through．For old broad-bellied Kathegu，another big squatter of the farm，father and grandfather to an enormous household，here rose and proposed to go through the sheep and goats which Kaninu was to hand over，indicating them individually one by one．This was all contrary to the custom of any Kyama，Jogona could never have invented the scheme，and I could only believe it to be founded upon an agreement between Kathegu and Jogona，for the benefit of Kathegu．I waited a little to see what would come of it．

Kaninu，to begin with，seemed to give himself up to his martyrdom，he ducked his head and puled，as if，for each animal named，a tooth was being drawn out of him．But when at last Kathegu，himself hesitating，designated a big yellow goat without horns，Kaninu's heart broke and his strength gave out．He came forward，out of his cloak，in one mighty gesture．For one moment he roared like a bull at me，a bellow for help，an awful de profundis，until he saw，in a quick glance，that I was on his side，and that he was not to lose the yellow goat．He then sat down without another sound；only after a while he gave Kathegu a very deep sarcastic glance．

After about a week of sitting and supernumerary sittings of the Kyama，the indemnification was finally fixed at forty sheep，to be paid by Kaninu to Jogona，but no individual sheep were to be indicated in the transfer．

A fortnight later Farah，in the evening while I was dining，gave me fresh news of the case．

Three old Kikuyu from Nyeri，he told me，had arrived at the farm the day before．They had heard of the case in their huts up at Nyeri，and had walked from there to appear on the stage and to plead that Wamai was not the son of Jogona but was their late brother's son，and that therefore the compensation for his death should lawfully fall to them．

I smiled at the impudence，and remarked to Farah that this was just like the Kikuyu of Nyeri．No，said Farah thoughtfully，he believed that they were right．Jogona had indeed come from Nyeri to the farm six years ago，and from what Farah had gathered，Wamai was not Jogona's son，“and never had been，”Farah said．It was，he went on，a great stroke of luck to Jogona that he had，two days before，been handed over twenty-five of his forty sheep．Otherwise Kaninu would have let them wander off to Nyeri soas to save himself the pain，Farah said，of meeting them on the farm now that they were no longer his．But Jogona would have to look out still，for the Nyeri Kikuyu were not easy to shake off．They had taken up their abode on the farm and were threatening to bring the case before the D．C．

In this way I was prepared for the appearance，a few days later，before my house，of the Nyeri people，who belonged to a low class of Kikuyu，and had all the look of three dirty and shaggy old Hyenas that had slunk one hundred and fifty miles upon Wamai's blood-track．With them came Jogona，in a state of great agitation and distress．The difference in the attitude of the parties probably arose from the fact that the Nyeri Kikuyu had nothing to lose，while Jogona had twenty-five sheep．The three strangers sat on the stones with no more manifestation of life than three ticks upon a sheep．I had no sympathy with their cause，for，whatever the circumstances were，they had taken no interest in the dead child while he had lived，and I was now sorry for Jogona，who had behaved well at the Kyama，and had，I believed，grieved over Wamai．Jogona，when I questioned him，trembled and sighed so that it was impossible to understand him，and we got no further on this occasion．

But two days later Jogona came back early in the morning，when I was at my typewriter，and asked me to write down for him the account of his relations to the dead child and its family．He wanted to take the report before the D．C．at Dagoretti．Jogona's very simple manner was impressive because he felt so strongly about things，and was entirely without self-consciousness．It was evident that he was looking upon his present resolution as upon a great enterprise，which was not without danger；he went to it with awe．

I wrote his statement down for him．It took a long time，for it was a long report of events more than six years old，and in themselves extremely complicated．Jogona，as he was going through it，continually had to break off his tale to think things over or to go back in it and reconstruct it．He was，most of the time，holding his head with both hands，at moments gravely slapping the crown of it as if to shake out the facts．Once he went and leaned his face against the wall，as the Kikuyu women do when they are giving birth to their children．

I took a duplicate of the report．I have still got it．

It was extremely difficult to follow，it gave a lot of complicated circumstances and irrelevant details．It was not surprising to me that Jogona had found it difficult to recollect，it was more surprising that he should be able to recollect the facts at all．It began：

“At the time when Waweru Wamai，of Nyeri，was about to die—na-taka kufa，wished to die，they have it in Swaheli—he had two wives．The one wife had three daughters，after Waweru's death she married another man．The other wife，Waweru had not yet paid for altogether：he still owed her father two goats for her．This wife had overstrained herself when she lifted a load of firewood and had had a miscarriage and nobody knew if she would bear any more children．．．”

It went on in this way，and dragged the reader into a thick maze of Kikuyu conditions and relations：

“This wife had one small child by the name of Wamai．At that same time he was sick，and the people believed that he had got smallpox．Waweru was very fond of his wife and of her child，and when he was dying he was very much worried because he did not know what would become of her when he himself should be dead．He therefore sent for his friend Jogona Kanyagga，who lived not far away．Jogona Kanyagga owed Waweru，at this time，three shillings for a pair of shoes．Waweru now suggested to him that they should make an agreement．．．”

The agreement came to this，that Jogona should take over his dying friend's wife and child，and pay to her father the two goats that were still due to him from the sum of her purchase price．From now the report became a list of expenses，which Jogona had brought upon himself through the adoption of the child Wamai．He had，he stated，purchased an extraordinarily good medicine for Wamai just after he had taken him over，when he was sick．At some time he had bought rice from the Indian duca for him，as he did not thrive on maize．Upon one occasion he had had to pay five rupees to a white farmer of the neighbourhood，who said that Wamai had chased one of his turkeys into a pond．This last amount of hard cash，which he had probably had difficulty in raising，had stamped itself upon the mind of Jogona；he came back to it more than once．From Jogona's manner it appeared that he had，by this time，forgotten that the child whom he had now lost had not been his own．He was shaken by the arrival and the claim of the three Nyeri people，in many ways．Very simple people seem to have a talent for adopting children，and feeling towards them as if they were their own；the facile hearts of the European peasants do the same without effort．

When Jogona had at last come to the end of his tale，and I had got it all down，I told him that I was now going to read it to him．He turned away from me while I was reading，as if to avoid all distractions．

But as I read out his own name，“And he sent for Jogona Kanyagga，who was his friend and who lived not far away，”he swiftly turned his face to me，and gave me a great fierce flaming glance，so exuberant with laughter that it changed the old man into a boy，into the very symbol of youth．Again as I had finished the document and was reading out his name，where it figured as a verification below his thumbmark，the vital direct glance was repeated，this time deepened and calmed，with a new dignity．

Such a glance did Adam give the Lord when he formed him out of the dust，and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life，and man became a living soul．I had created him and shown him himself：Jogona Kanyagga of life everlasting．When I handed him the paper，he took it reverently and greedily，folded it up in a corner of his cloak and kept his hand upon it．He could not afford to lose it，for his soul was in it，and it was the proof of his existence．Here was something which Jogona Kanyagga had performed，and which would preserve his name for ever：the flesh was made word and dwelt among us full of grace and truth．

The world of the written word was opened to the Native of Africa at the time when I lived out there．I had then，if I wanted to，an opportunity of catching the past by its tail and of living through a bit of our own history：the period when the large plain population of Europe had in the same way had the letter revealed to them．In Denmark it happened a good hundred years ago，and from what I had been told by people who were very old when I was a child，I believe that the reaction in both cases has been nearly exactly the same．Human beings can but rarely have shown such a humble and ecstatic devotion to the principle of Art for Art's sake．

These communications from one young Native to another were still generally composed by professional letter-writers，for，although some of the old people were carried away by the spirit of the age，and a few very old Kikuyu attended my school and patiently toiled through the ABC，most of the elder generation withheld themselves distrustfully from the phenomenon．Only a few of the Natives could read，and my houseboys，and the squatters and labourers of the farm，therefore brought their letters to me to have them read out．As I opened and studied one letter after another，I wondered at the insignificance of the contents．It was the common mistake of a prejudiced civilized person．You might as well have set to herborize the little olive branch that Noah's dove brought home．Whatever it looked like，it carried more weight than all the ark with the animals in it；it contained a new green world．

The Natives' letters were all very much alike，they kept close to a sanctioned and sacred formula，and ran more or less as follows：“My dear friend Kamau Morefu．I will now take the pen in my hand”—in an unliteral sense，for it was the professional scribe who was writing，“to write you a letter，for I have for a long time wished to write a letter to you．I am very well and it is my hope that you are，by the grace of God，very well．My mother is very well．My wife is not very well，but I still have the hope that your wife will be，by the mercy of God，well．”—here would follow a long list of names，with a short report attached to each of them，mostly insignificant，although at times very fantastic．Then the letter was closed．“Now my friend Kamau，I will finish this letter，for I have got too little time to write to you．Your friend Ndwetti Lori．”

To transfer similar messages between young studious Europeans a hundred years ago，postillions vaulted into the saddle，horses galloped，post-horns were blown，and paper with ligulate gilt edges was manufactured．The letters were welcomed，cherished，and preserved；I have seen a few of them myself．

Before I learned to speak Swaheli，my relation to this Native world of letters had a curious feature to it：I could read out what they wrote without understanding a word of it．The Swaheli tongue has had no written language until the white people took upon themselves to make up one；with care it was spelled out as it is pronounced，and it has got no antiquated orthography to entrap a reader．I would then sit and read out their writings orthodoxly，word for word，with the receivers of the letters in breathless suspense all around me，and could follow the effect of my reading without in the least knowing what it was all about．Sometimes they would burst into tears at my words，or wring their hands，at other times they cried out with delight；the most common reaction to the lection was laughter，and they were continually doubled up by convulsions of laughter while I read．

When later on I got so far as to understand what I was reading，I learned that the effect of a piece of news was many times magnified when it was imparted in writing．The messages that would have been received with doubt and scorn if they had been given by word of mouth—for all Natives are great sceptics—were now taken as gospel truth．Natives are，in the same way，extremely quick of hearing towards any confounding of a word in speech；such a mistake gives them a great malicious pleasure，and they will never forget it，and may name a white man for his lifetime after a slip of his tongue；but if a mistake was made in writing，which was often the case，as the Scribes were ignorant people，they would insist on construing it into some sense，they might wonder over it and discuss it，but they would believe the most absurd things rather than find fault with the written word．

In one of the letters that I read out to a boy on the farm，the writer，amongst other news，gave the laconic message：“I have cooked a baboon．”I explained that he must have meant that he had caught a baboon，since also in Swaheli the two words are somewhat alike．But the receiver of the letter would by no means consent to it．

“No，Msabu，no，”he said．“what has he written in my letter？What is written down？”

“He has written，”I said，“that he has cooked a baboon，but how would he cook a baboon？And if he had really done so he would write more to tell you of why and how he did it．”

The young Kikuyu grew very ill at ease at such criticism of the scriptural word；he asked to have his letter back，folded it up carefully and walked away with it．

As to Jogona's statement which I took down，it proved very useful to him，for when the D．C．had read it，he dismissed the appeal of the Nyeri people，who walked scowling back to their own village，without having got anything off the farm．

The document now became Jogona's great treasure．I saw it again more than once．Jogona made a little leather bag for it，embroidered with beads，and hung it on a strap round his neck．From time to time，mostly on Sunday mornings，he would suddenly appear in my door，lift the bag off and take out the paper to have it read to him．Once when I had been ill，and was for the first time again out riding，he caught sight of me at a distance，ran after me a long way，and stood by my horse all out of breath，to hand me his document．At each reading his face took on the same impress of deep religious triumph，and after the reading he solicitously smoothed out his paper，folded it up and put it back in the bag．The importance of the account was not lessened but augmented with time，as if to Jogona the greatest wonder about it was that it did not change．The past，that had been so difficult to bring to memory，and that had probably seemed to be changing every time it was thought of，had here been caught，conquered and pinned down before his eyes．It had become history；with it there was now no variableness neither shadow of turning．





Wanyangerri


When I was next in Nairobi，I went to see Wanyangerri in the Native Hospital．

As I had so many squatter families on my land，I was hardly ever without a patient in there，I was an habituée de la maison，and on friendly terms with the matron and the orderlies．I have never seen a person who put on paint and powder so thick as the matron，within her white coif her broad face looked like the face of those Russian wooden dolls which will unscrew，and have then got another doll inside them，and another inside that，and which are sold under the name of Katinka．She was a kind and capable matron，as you would expect it from Katinka．On Thursdays they moved all beds out of the wards to an open square between them，while they cleaned and aired the houses；this was a pleasant day in hospital．There was a great fine view from the court，with the dry Athi plains in the foreground，and far away the blue mountain of Donyo Sabouk and the long Mua Hills．It was a curious thing to see my old Kikuyu women in beds with white sheets to them，like seeing an old worn-out mule，or other patient beast of burden there；they themselves laughed to me at the situation，but sourly，as an old mule might do，for Natives are afraid of hospitals．

The first time that I saw Wanyangerri in hospital，he was so shaken and overcome that I thought the best thing for him would be to die．He was frightened of everything，weeping all the time that I was with him，and begging to be taken back to the farm；he shook and trembled in his bandages．

It was a week till I came in again．I found him then calm and collected，he received me with dignity．He was however very pleased to see me，and the orderly told me that he had been waiting impatiently for my arrival．For he could today tell me，with much assertiveness，and spitting out the words through a tube in his mouth，that he had been killed the day before，and was going to be killed again in a few days' time．

The doctor who treated Wanyangerri had been to the war in France，and had patched up many people's faces；he took trouble about him and made a success of the work．He put in a metal band for a jawbone and screwed it on to the bones left in the face，and he plucked up the bits of torn flesh and stitched them together to make a sort of chin for him．He even，Wanyangerri told me，had a bit of skin taken from the shoulder to fill up his patchwork．When at the end of the treatment the bandages came off，the face of the child was much changed，and looked queer，like the head of a lizard，because it had got no chin．But he was able to eat in a normal way and to speak，although after the accident he always lisped a little．All this took many months．When I came to see Wanyangerri he asked me for sugar，so I used to bring a few spoonfuls in a bit of paper．




The Natives，if they are not paralyzed and benumbed by their terror of the unknown，growl and grumble much in hospital，and invent schemes for getting away．Death is one of these；they do not fear it．The Europeans who have built and equipped the hospitals，and who are working in them，and have with much trouble got the patients dragged there，complain with bitterness that the Natives know nothing of gratitude，and that it is the same what you do to them．

To white people there is something vexatious and mortifying in this state of mind in the Natives．It is indeed the same what you do to them；you can do but little，and what you do disappears，and will never be heard of again；they do not thank you，and they bear you no malice，and even should you want to，you cannot do anything about it．It is an alarming quality；it seems to annul your existence as an individual human being，and to inflict upon you a rôle not of your own choosing，as if you were a phenomenon in nature，as if you were the weather．

The immigrant Somalis in this respect differ from the Natives of the country．Your behaviour to them affects them strongly；in fact，you can hardly move without affecting the fierce burning prigs of the desert in one way or the other，and，very often，not without deeply hurting them．They have a keen sense of gratitude and will also bear malice for ever．A benefit，like an offence or a slight，is written in stone in their hearts．They are severe Mohammedans and，like all Mohammedans，have a moral code according to which they will judge you．With the Somalis you can make or destroy your prestige within an hour．

The Masai here hold a position peculiar to themselves amongst the Native tribes．They remember，they can thank you，and they will bear you a grudge．They all bear us all a grudge，which will be wiped out only when the tribe is wiped out itself．

But the unprejudiced Kikuyu，Wakambas，or Kavirondos，know of no code．They have it that most people are capable of most things，and you cannot shock them if you want to．It is，it can be said，a poor or perverted Kikuyu，to whom it makes any difference what you do to him．Left to their own nature，and to the tradition of their nation，they will look upon our activities as upon those of nature．They judge you not，but they are keen observers．The sum of their observations is what you pass for with them，your good or bad name．

The very poor people of Europe，in this way，are like the Kikuyus．They judge you not，but sum you up．If they like or esteem you at all，it is in the manner in which people love God；not for what you do to them，not at all for what you do to them，but for what you are．

One day in my wanderings through the hospital I saw three new patients there，a very black man with a thick heavy head，and two boys，who were all three bandaged at the throat．One of the orderlies in the ward was a hunchback and a narrator，who took a pleasure in explaining to me the most intriguing cases in his house．As he saw me stopping before the beds of the newcomers he came up and told me their story．

They were Nubians in the band of the King's African Rifles，the black soldiers of Kenya．The boys were drummers，and the man a horn-player．The horn-player had had serious controversies in his life，and had lost his head over them as it will happen to Natives．First he had fired his rifle right and left over the barracks，and when the magazine was empty he had shut himself up with the two boys，in his hut of corrugated iron there，and had tried to cut their throats and his own．The orderly was sorry that I had not seen them when they had been brought in last week，for then they had all been covered in blood，and I would have believed them to be dead．Now they were out of danger，and the murderer had got his senses back．

As the story-teller went through his tale，the three persons in the bed upon whom it turned were following it with deep attention．They interrupted him to correct the details of his tale，the boys，who had great difficulty in speaking，turning to the man in the bed between them to make him confirm their statement，confident that he would assist them to let me have the story as effectively as possible．

“Did you not foam at the mouth，did you not shriek？”they asked him．“Did you not say that you would cut us up in bits as big as a grasshopper？”

The manslayer said，“Yes，yes，”with a mournful mien．

At times I would be kept in Nairobi for half a day，waiting for a business meeting，or for the European mail when the train from the coast was late．On such occasions when I did not know what to do，I used to drive up to the Native Hospital and take a couple of the convalescents there out for a short joy-ride．At the time when Wanyangerri was in hospital，the governor，Sir Edward Northey，kept a couple of young lions，which he was sending on to the London Zoo，caged up in the Government House grounds．They were a great attraction to the people in hospital；they all asked to be taken to see them．I had promised the patients of the K．A．R．band to take them up there when they were well enough for it，but none of them would come until they could all go together．The horn-player was the slowest to recover，one of the boys was even discharged from hospital before he was well enough to go with me．The boy came back to hospital every day to inquire about him，so as to be sure to have his drive．I found him outside there one afternoon，and he told me that the bugler still had a very terrible headache，but that this was only to be expected since his head had been so filled with devils．

In the end they came，all three，and stood before the cage sunk in contemplation．One of the young lions，angry at being stared at for such a long time，suddenly got up，stretched himself and gave a short roar，so that the onlookers got a shock，and the smallest boy took cover behind the bugler．As we were driving back he said to him：“That lion was as villainous as you were．”




During all this time Wanyangerri's case was lying dormant out on the farm．His people sometimes came and asked me how he was getting on，but，with the exception of his little brother，they seemed scared of going in to see him．Kaninu also came round to my house late in the evening，like an old badger out reconnoitring，to sound me about the child．Farah and I，between ourselves，at times weighed up his sufferings，and computed them in sheep．

Farah also，a couple of months after the accident，informed me of a new feature of the case．

On these occasions he would come in while I was dining，stand erect by the end of the table and take upon himself to enlighten my ignorance．Farah spoke both English and French well，but stuck to certain mistakes peculiar to him．He would say“exactly”in the place of“except”—“all the cows have come home，exactly the grey cow”—and instead of correcting him I took to using the same expressions when I talked to him．His face and countenance were assured and dignified，but he would often start in a vague manner：“Memsahib，”he said，“the Kabero．”This was the programme then．I waited for what was to follow．

After a pause Farah took up the subject again．“You think，Memsahib，”he said，“that Kabero is dead and has been eaten by the hyenas．He is not dead．He is with the Masai．”

In two minds I asked him how he knew of this．“Oh，I know，”he said，“Kaninu has got too many girls married to Masai．When Kabero could not think of anybody who would help him exactly the Masai，he ran out to his sister's husband．It is true that he had a bad time，he sat all night in a tree and the hyenas stood around it underneath．Now he is living with the Masai．There is a rich old Masai，who has got many hundred cows，who has no children himself and wants to get Kabero．Kaninu knows of all this very well，and has been out to talk it over with the Masai many times．But he is afraid to tell you，he believes that if the white people know of it，Kabero will be hanged in Nairobi．”

Farah always spoke of the Kikuyu in an arrogant way．“The Masai wives，”he said，“bear no children．They are pleased enough to get Kikuyu children．They steal too many．Still，this Kabero，”he went on，“he will come back to the farm when he grows up，for he will not want to live like the Masai，always going from one place to the other．The Kikuyu are too lazy for that．”

From the farm，the tragic fate of the disappearing Masai tribe on the other side of the river could be followed from year to year．They were fighters who had been stopped fighting，a dying lion with his claws clipped，a castrated nation．Their spears had been taken from them，their big dashing shields even，and in the Game Reserve the lions followed their herds of cattle．Once，on the farm，I had three young bulls transmuted into peaceful bullocks for my ploughs and wagons，and afterwards shut up in the factory yard．There in the night the hyenas smelled the blood and came up and killed them．This，I thought，was the fate of the Masai．

“Kaninu's wife，”said Farah，“is sorry to lose her son for so many years．”

I did not send for Kaninu，for I did not know whether to believe what Farah had told me or not，but when he next came to my house I went out to talk with him．“Kaninu，”I asked him，“is Kabero alive？Is he with the Masai？”You will never find a Native unprepared for any action of yours，and Kaninu immediately burst into weeping over his lost child．I listened to him and looked at him for a little while．“Kaninu，”I said again，“bring Kabero here．He will not be hanged．His mother shall keep him with her on the farm．”Kaninu had not stopped his laments to listen，but he must have caught my unfortunate word of hanging；his wails were drawn into a deeper note，he dived into descriptions of the promise that Kabero had given，and of his own preference for him above all his other children．

Kaninu had a lot of children and grandchildren who，as his village was so near to my house，were always about it．Amongst them was a very small grandson of his，the son of one of those daughters of Kaninu who had married into the Masai Reserve，but who had come back from it and had brought her child with her．This child's name was Sirunga．The mixture of blood in him had come out in the quaintest vitality，such a wild profusion of inventiveness and whims that he was like nothing quite human：a small flame，a night bird，a diminutive genie of the farm．But he had epilepsy，and，because of that，the other children were afraid of him，chasing him away from their games and naming him Sheitani—the devil—so that I had adopted him into my household．As he was ill he could do no work，but he filled with me exceedingly well the office of a fool or jester and followed me about everywhere like a small fidgety black shadow．Kaninu knew of my affection for the child，and till now had smiled at it in a grand fatherly way；now he seized it，turned it at me and worked it for all it was worth．He declared with great strength that he would rather have Sirunga ten times eaten by leopards than he would lose Kabero，indeed now that Kabero was lost let Sirunga go as well，it would make no difference—for Kabero，Kabero had been the apple of his eye and his heart's blood．

If Kabero were indeed dead，this was David grieving over his son Absalom，a tragedy to be left to itself．But if he were alive and hidden with the Masai it was more than tragic，it was a fight or flight，a struggle for the life of a child．

I have seen，on the plains，the gazelles play this game when I have unknowingly come upon the spot where they were hiding their newborn fawn．They would dance to you，step up before you，jump，caper，or pretend to be lame and unable to run—all to distract your attention from their young．And suddenly，actually under the hoofs of your horse，you saw the fawn，immovable，the small head stretched out flat on the grass，lying low for his life while his mother dances for it．A bird will do the same tricks to protect her young ones，flap and flutter and even cleverly act the role of the wounded bird，which trails her broken wing on the ground．

Here was Kaninu performing to me．Was there so much warmth and so many gambols left in the old Kikuyu when he thought his son's life at stake？His bones creaked in the dance，he was even changing sex in it，and had taken on the appearance of an old woman，a hen，a lioness—the game was so plainly a feminine activity．It was a grotesque performance，but at the same time highly respectable，like the cock ostrich taking turns with the hen in sitting on her eggs．No woman's heart could have remained unmoved by the manoeuvre．

“Kaninu，”I said to him，“when Kabero wants to return to the farm he can do so and no harm shall come to him．But you must bring him up here to me yourself at that time．”Kaninu became dead silent，he bowed his head and walked away sadly as if he had now lost his last friend in the world．




I may as well tell here that Kaninu remembered，and did as he had been told．Five years afterwards，when I had almost forgotten the whole affair，he one day through Farah applied for an interview．I found him standing outside the house，on one leg，very dignified，but at the bottom of his heart uneasy．He addressed me in an amiable way．“Kabero is back，”he said．By that time I had learned the art of the pause，I did not say a word．The old Kikuyu felt the weight of my silence，he changed feet，and his eyelids quivered．“My son Kabero has come back to the farm，”he repeated．I asked：“He is back from Masai？”Immediately，by the fact that he had made me speak，Kaninu took it that our reconciliation was effected；he did not smile yet，but all the cunning little wrinkles in his face were adjusted for a smile．“Yes，Msabu，yes，he is back from the Masai，”he said，“he has come back to work for you．”The government in the intermediate time had introduced the Kipanda，the registration of each individual Native，in the country，so that we would now have to call a police officer out from Nairobi to make a lawful inhabitant of the farm out of Kabero．Kaninu and I appointed the day．

Upon that day，Kaninu and his son arrived a long time before the police officer．Kaninu presented Kabero to me in a jovial manner，but at heart he was a little frightened of his recovered son．He had reason to be so，for the Masai Reserve had had from the farm a small lamb，and now gave us back a young leopard．Kabero must have had Masai blood in him，the habits and discipline of Masai life could not in themselves have worked the metamorphosis．Here he stood，a Masai from head to foot．

A Masai warrior is a fine sight．Those young men have，to the utmost extent，that particular form of intelligence which we call chic；daring，and wildly fantastical as they seem，they are still unswervingly true to their own nature，and to an immanent ideal．Their style is not an assumed manner，nor an imitation of a foreign perfection；it has grown from the inside，and is an expression of the race and its history，and their weapons and finery are as much part of their being as are a stag's antlers．

Kabero had adopted the Masai fashion in hair-dressing，he wore his hair long and braided with string into a thick pigtail and a leather strap round the brow．He had acquired the Masai carriage of the head，with the chin stretched forward，as if he were presenting you his sullen arrogant face upon a tray．He had also the general rigid，passive，and insolent bearing of the Moran，that makes of him an object for contemplation，such as a statue is，a figure which is to be seen，but which itself does not see．

The young Masai Morani live upon milk and blood；it is perhaps this diet that gives them their wonderful smoothness and silkiness of skin．Their faces，with the high cheek-bones and boldly swung jaw-bones，are sleek，without a line or groove in them，swollen；the dim unseeing eyes lie therein like two dark stones tightly fitted into a mosaic；altogether the young Morani have a likeness to mosaics．The muscles of their necks swell in a particular sinister fashion，like the neck of the angry cobra，the male leopard or the fighting bull，and the thickness is so plainly an indication of virility that it stands for a declaration of war to all the world with the exception of the woman．The great contrast，or harmony，between these swollen smooth faces，full necks，and broad rounded shoulders，and the surprising narrowness of their waist and hips，the leanness and spareness of the thigh and knee and the long，straight，sinewy leg give them the look of creatures trained through hard discipline to the height of rapaciousness，greed，and gluttony．

The Masai walk stiffly，placing one slim foot straight in front of the other，but their movements of arm，wrist，and hand are very supple．When a young Masai shoots with a bow and arrow，and lets go the bow-string，you seem to hear the sinews of his long wrist singing in the air with the arrow．

The police officer from Nairobi was a young man lately out from England and full of zeal．He spoke Swaheli very well，so that I and Kaninu did not understand what he said，and he became absorbed in interest in the old case of the shooting accident，and put Kaninu to a cross-examination under which the Kikuyu turned into wood．When he had finished it，he told me that he thought Kaninu had been monstrously treated，and that the whole case ought to be taken up in Nairobi．“That will mean years of your life and mine，”I said．He asked me to be allowed to remark that this was no consideration to be taken，where the execution of justice was concerned．Kaninu looked to me；for a moment he believed that he was being trapped．In the end it was found that the case was too old to be taken up，and nothing more was done about it，except that Kabero was regularly registered on the farm．




But all these things were to happen only a long time later．For five years Kabero was dead to the farm，wandering with the Masai，and Kaninu had much to go through still．Before the case had done with him，forces came into play which seized him and ground him very small．

Of those I cannot tell much．First because they were in themselves of a hidden nature，and secondly，because at the time things were happening to me myself，that took my thoughts off Kaninu and his fate，and left，in my mind，the general affairs of the farm in the background like that distant mountain of Kilimanjaro，which sometimes I could see from my land，and sometimes not．The Natives would take such periods of distraction of mine meekly，as if I had been in reality lifted from their existence into another plane，afterwards they referred to them as to times when I had been away．“That big tree fell down，”they said．“My child died，while you were with the white people．”

When Wanyangerri was well enough to leave Hospital，I fetched him back to the farm，and from that time only saw him at intervals，at a Ngoma or on the plains．

A few days after his return his father，Wainaina，and his grandmother presented themselves at my house．Wainaina was a small rotund man，a rare thing in a Kikuyu，for they are nearly all of them lean people．He grew a spare thin beard，and another peculiarity of his was that he could not look you straight in the face．He made the impression of a mental troglodyte，who wants to be left to himself．With him came his mother，a very old Kikuyu woman．

Native women shave their heads，and it is a curious thing how quickly you yourself will come to feel that these little round neat skulls，which look like some kind of dusky nuts，are the sign of true womanliness，and that a crop of hair on the head of a woman is as unladylike as a beard．Wainaina's old mother had left the little tufts of white hair on her shrivelled scalp to grow，and thereby，as much as an unshaven man，she conveyed the impression of dissoluteness or shamelessness．She leant on her stick and left it to Wainaina to speak，but her silence was striking sparks the while；she seemed to be all loaded with a graceless vitality，of which she had passed none on to her son．The two were in reality Uraka and Laskaro，but of that I did not know till later．

They had come shuffling up to my house on a peaceful errand．Wanyangerri，his father told me，could chew no maize，they were poor people and short of flour and they had got no milking cow．Would I not，till Wanyangerri's case was settled，allow him a little milk from my cows？Otherwise they did not see how they were to keep the child alive until the time when his indemnification should come in．Farah was away in Nairobi on one of his private Somali lawsuits，and in his absence I consented to let Wanyangerri have a bottle of milk a day from my herd of Native cows，and instructed my houseboys，who seemed strangely unwilling or uncomfortable about the arrangement，to let him fetch it from us every morning．

A fortnight passed，or three weeks；then one evening Kaninu came to the house．He suddenly stood in the room where I was reading by the fire after dinner．As the Natives generally prefer a discussion to take place outside the house，the manner in which he shut the door behind him，prepared me for surprising communications．But the first surprise was that Kaninu was dumb．The subtle and honeyed tongue was as dead as if it had been cut out of him，and the room，with Kaninu in it，remained silent．The big old Kikuyu was looking very ill，he hung upon his stick，there seemed to be no body inside his cloak，his eyes were dim like the eyes of a corpse，and he kept on wetting his dry lips with his tongue．

When at last he began to speak it was only to state，slowly and dismally，that he thought things were bad．A little later he added in a vague manner，as if it were altogether a matter to be ignored，that he had now paid over ten sheep to Wainaina．And now Wainaina，he went on，wanted a cow and calf from him as well，and he was going to give them to him．Why had he done that，I asked him，when no judgment had yet been given？Kaninu did not answer，he did not even look at me．He was，this evening，a traveller or pilgrim who had no continuing city．He had come in，as it were on his way，to report to me，and now he was off again．I could not but think that he was ill；after a pause I said that I would take him into hospital the next day．At that he gave me a short，painful glance：the old mocker was being bitterly mocked．But before he went away he did a curious thing，he lifted up a hand to his face as if he were wiping off a tear．It would be a strange thing，like the flowering of the pilgrim's staff，should Kaninu have tears in him to shed，and stranger still that he should put them to no use．I wondered what had been happening on the farm while I had had my thoughts off it．When Kaninu had gone I sent for Farah and asked him．

Farah at times was loth to speak about Native affairs，as if they were beneath him to dwell upon and me to hear of．In the end he consented to tell me，all the time looking past me out of the window，at the stars．At the bottom of Kaninu's loss of heart was Wainaina's mother，who was a witch and had cast a spell upon him．

“But，Farah，”I said，“Kaninu，surely，is much too old and wise to believe in a spell．”

“No，”said Farah slowly．“No，Memsahib．For this old Kikuyu wife can really do these things，I think．”

The old woman had told Kaninu that his cows would live to see that it would have been better to them had Kaninu at the beginning given them to Wainaina．Now Kaninu's cows were going blind，one after another．And under the ordeal Kaninu's heart was slowly breaking，like the bones and tissue of those people who，in old times，were put to the torture of ever increased weights laid on to them．

Farah spoke of Kikuyu witchcraft in a dry，concerned manner，as of foot-and-mouth disease on the farm，which we ourselves would not catch，but by which we might lose our cattle．

I sat late in the evening thinking of the witchery on the farm．At first it looked ugly，as if it had come up from an old grave to flatten its nose upon my window-panes．I heard the hyena wailing some way off，down by the river，and remembered that the Kikuyu had their werewolves，old women who at night take on the shape of hyenas．Perhaps Wainaina's mother was trotting along the river now，baring her teeth in the night air．And I had by now become used to the idea of witchcraft，it seemed a reasonable thing，so many things are about，at night，in Africa．

“This old woman is mean，”I thought in Swaheli，“she uses her arts in making Kaninu's cows blind，and she leaves it to me to keep her grandchild alive，on a bottle of milk a day，from my own cows．”

I thought：“This accident and the things which have come from it，are getting into the blood of the farm，and it is my fault．I must call in fresh forces，or the farm will run into a bad dream，a nightmare．I know what I will do．I will send for Kinanjui．”





A Kikuyu Chief


The big Chief Kinanjui lived about nine miles northeast of the farm，in the Kikuyu Reserve near the French Mission，and ruled over more than a hundred thousand Kikuyus．He was a crafty old man，with a fine manner，and much real greatness to him，although he had not been born to be a chief，but had been made so，many years ago，by the English，when they could no longer get on with the legitimate ruler of the Kikuyus of the district．

Kinanjui was a friend of mine，and had been helpful to me on many occasions．His manyatta，to which I had ridden over a few times，was as dirty and as full of flies as those of the other Kikuyus．But it was much bigger than any other I had seen，for in his position of a chief kinanjui had given himself over fully to the joys of marriage．The village was alive with wives of his of all ages，from skinny toothless old hags on crutches to slim，moon-faced，gazelle eyed wenches，their arms and long legs wound up in shining copper wire．His children were everywhere，in clusters，like the flies．The young men，his sons，erect，with decorated heads，went to and fro，and caused much trouble．Kinanjui had told me once that he had at the moment fifty-five sons who were Morani．

Sometimes the old chief would come walking over to my farm in a gorgeous fur cloak，accompanied by two or three white-haired senators and a few of his warrior-sons，on a friendly visit，or to take a rest from governmental affairs．He would then pass the afternoon in one of the verandah chairs that had been carried out on the lawn for him，smoking the cigars that I sent him out，with his councillors and his guard squatting on the grass round him．My houseboys and squatters，when they had news of his arrival，came and grouped themselves there，and entertained him with the happenings on the farm，the whole company forming a sort of political club under the tall trees．Kinanjui in these meetings had a manner of his own：when he thought that the discussions were dragging out too long，he leant back in his chair，and，while still keeping the fire in his cigar alive，he closed his eyes and drew his breath deeply and slowly，in a low regular snore，a sort of official，pro forma sleep，which he may have cultivated for use in his own council of state．I sometimes had a chair moved out for a talk with him，and on these occasions Kinanjui sent away everybody，to point out that now the world was going to be governed in earnest．He was not，at the time I knew him，the man that he had been，life had taken much out of him．But when he talked freely and openly，for my private ear，he showed much originality of mind，and a rich，daring，imaginative spirit；he had thought the matter of life over and held his own strong views upon it．

A few years earlier a thing had happened which had strengthened the friendship between me and Kinanjui．

He came to my house one day when I was lunching with a friend who was on his way up country；I had no time to give the Kikuyu chief till my friend had gone．Kinanjui would expect to be offered a drink while he was waiting，and after his long walk in the sun，but I did not have enough of one thing to make up a glassful，so my guest and I filled a tumbler with all the different sorts of strong liquor that I had in the house．I thought that the stronger I made it，the longer it would keep Kinanjui occupied，and I took it out to him myself．But Kinanjui，after having with a little gentle smile just wetted his lips，gave me as deep a glance as I have ever had from a man，laid his head back and emptied the glass to the last drop．

Half an hour later，when my friend had just driven off，my houseboys came in and said：“Kinanjui is dead．”I felt，in one moment，the tragedy and the scandal rise up before me like great grave shadows．I went out to see him．

He was lying on the ground in the shade of the kitchen，with no expression whatever in his face，with blue lips and fingers，dead-cold．It was like having shot an elephant：by an act of yours a mighty and majestic creature，which has walked the earth，and held his own opinions of everything，is walking it no more．He looked degraded as well，for the Kikuyu had poured water over him，and had taken off him his big cloak of monkey-skin．Naked he was like an animal when you have cut from it the trophy，for the sake of which you have killed it．

I meant to send Farah for a doctor，but we could not get the car started，and Kinanjui's people kept on begging us to wait a little before we did anything．

An hour later，as I was going out again，with a heavy heart，to talk to them，my boys came in to me once more and said：“Kinanjui has gone home．”It seemed that he had suddenly got up，draped his cloak about him，and his retainers round him，and had walked off，the nine miles to his village，without a word．

After this time，I believe，Kinanjui felt that I had run a risk，even braved a danger—for you are not allowed to give Natives alcohol—to make him happy．He had been to the farm since，and had smoked a cigar with us，but he had not mentioned a drink．I would have given it to him had he asked for it，but I knew that he would not ask any more．




I now sent a runner to Kinanjui's village and explained to him the whole affair of the shooting．I asked him to come over to the farm to finish it．I suggested that we should give Wainaina the cow and calf of which Kaninu had talked，and then let the whole matter finish at that．I was looking forward to Kinanjui's arrival，for he had the quality，which everyone values in a friend，of being effective．

By this letter of mine，the case，that had for some time been becalmed，fetched wind and ended up dramatically．

One afternoon，as I was riding back to my house，I just caught sight of a car that came along at a terrible speed，rounding the drive upon two wheels．It was a scarlet car with a lot of nickel on it．I knew it，it belonged to the American Consul of Nairobi，and I wondered what urgent business it was which brought the consul to my house at such a pace．But as I was getting off my horse at the back of the house，Farah came out to tell me that the Chief Kinanjui had arrived．He had come in his own car，which he had the day before bought from the American Consul，and he did not want to get out of it till I had seen him in it．

I found Kinanjui sitting up straight in the car，immovable as an idol．He had on a large cloak of blue monkey-skins，and on his head a skull cap，of the kind which the Kikuyu make out of sheep's stomachs．He was always an impressive figure，tall and broad，with no fat on him anywhere；his face too was proud，long and bony，with a slanting forehead like that of a Red Indian．He had a broad nose，so expressive that it looked like the central point of the man，as if the whole stately figure was there only to carry the broad nose about．Like the trunk of an elephant，it was both boldly inquisitive and extremely sensitive and prudent，intensely on the offensive，and on the defensive as well．And an elephant，finally，like Kinanjui，would have a head of the very greatest nobility if he did not look so clever．

Kinanjui now did not open his mouth or wince while I paid him my compliments on the car，he stared straight in front of him in order that I should see his face in profile like a head struck upon a medal．As I walked round to the front of the car，he turned his head so as to keep his regal profile towards me；perhaps he really had in his mind the King's head on the rupee．One of his young sons was driver to him，and the car was boiling hard．When the ceremony was over，I invited Kinanjui to come out of the car．He collected his big cloak round him in a majestic gesture and descended，and in that one movement he stepped back two thousand years，into Kikuyu justice．

On the western wall of my house there was a stone seat and in front of it a table made out of a mil-stone．This stone had a tragic history：it was the upper mill-stone of the mill of the two murdered Indians．After the murder nobody dared to take over the mill，it was empty and silent for a long time，and I had the stone brought up to my house to form a table top，to remind me of Denmark．The Indian millers had told me that their mill-stone had come over the sea from Bombay，as the stones of Africa are not hard enough for the work of grinding．On the top side a pattern was carved，and it had a few large brown spots on it，which my houseboys held to be the blood of the Indians，that would never come off．The mill-stone table in a way constituted the centre of the farm，for I used to sit behind it in all my dealings with the Natives．From the stone seat behind the mill-stone，I and Denys Finch-Hatton had one New Year seen the new moon and the planets of Venus and Jupiter all close together，in a group on the sky；it was such a radiant sight that you could hardly believe it to be real，and I have never seen it again．

I took my seat there now，with Kinanjui on the bench on my left．Farah took up his stand on my right hand，and there from kept a watchful eye on the Kikuyus，who had been gathering round the house，and who kept coming in as the news of Kinanjui's arrival spread on the farm．




Farah's attitude to the Natives of the country was a picturesque thing．No more than the attire and countenance of the Masai warriors，had it been made yesterday，or the day before；it was the product of many centuries．The forces which had built it up had constructed great buildings in stone as well，but they had crumbled into dust a long time ago．

When you first come to the country，landing at Mombasa，you will see，amongst the old light-grey baobab trees—which look not like any earthly kind of vegetation but like porous fossilizations，gigantic belemnites—grey stone ruins of houses，minarets，and wells．The same sort of ruins are to be found all the way up the coast，at Takaunga，Kalifiand Lamu．They are the remnants of the towns of the ancient Arab traders in ivory and slaves．

The dhows of the traders knew all the African fairways，and trod the blue paths to the central marketplace of Zanzibar．They were familiar with it at the time when Aladdin sent to the sultan four hundred black slaves loaded with jewels，and when the sultana feasted with her Negro lover while her husband was hunting，and was put to death for it．

Probably，as these great merchants grew rich，they brought their harems with them to Mombasa and Kalifi，and themselves remained in their villas，by the long white breakers of the ocean，and the flowering flaming trees，while they sent their expeditions up into the highlands．

For from the wild hard country there，the scorched dry plains，and unknown waterless stretches，from the land of the broad thorn-trees along the rivers，and the diminutive，strong-smelling wild flowers of the black soil，came their wealth．Here，upon the roof of Africa，wandered the heavy，wise，majestic bearer of the ivory．He was deep in his own thoughts and wanted to be left to himself．But he was followed，and shot with poisoned arrows by the little dark Wanderobos，and with long，muzzle loaded，silver-inlaid guns by the Arabs；he was trapped and thrown into pits all for the sake of his long smooth light-brown tusks，that they sat and waited for it at Zanzibar．

Here，also，little bits of forest soil were cleared，burned，and planted with sweet potatoes and maize，by a peace-loving shy nation，which was not much good at fighting，or at inventing anything，but wished to be left to themselves，and which，with the ivory，was in great demand on the market．The greater and lesser birds of prey gathered up here：

Tous les tristes oiseaux mangeurs de chair humaine…

S'assemblent．Et les uns laissant un crâne chauve，

Les autres aux gibets essuyant leur bec fauve

D'autres，d'un mat rompu quittant les noirs agrès？



The cold sensual Arabs came，contemptuous of death，with their minds，out of business times，on astronomy，algebra，and their harems．With them came their young illegitimate half-brothers the Somali—impetuous，quarrelsome，abstinent and greedy，who made up for their lack of birth by being zealous Mohammedans，and more faithful to the commandments of the prophet than the children got in wedlock．The Swaheli went along with them，slaves themselves and slave-hearted，cruel，obscene，thievish，full of good sense and jests，running to fat with age．

Up country they were met by the Native bird of prey of the highlands．The Masai came，silent，like tall narrow black shadows，with spears and heavy shields，distrustful of strangers，red-handed，to sell their brothers．

The different birds must have sat together up here and talked．Farah told me that in the old time，before the Somali brought their own women down from Somaliland，their young men could marry with the daughters of the Masai only，out of all the tribes of the country．This must have been in many ways a strange alliance．For the Somali are a religious people，and the Masai have no religion whatever，nor the slightest interest in anything above this earth．The Somali are clean，and take much trouble over their ablutions and hygiene，while the Masai are a dirty nation．The Somali，too，attach the greatest importance to the virginity of their brides，but the young Masai girls take their morals very lightly．Farah gave me the explanation at once．The Masai，he said，had never been slaves．They cannot be made slaves，they cannot even be put into prison．They die in prison if they are brought there，within three months，so the English law of the country holds with no penalty of imprisonment for the Masai，they are punished by fines．This stark inability to keep alive under the yoke has given the Masai，alone amongst all the Native tribes，rank with the immigrant aristocracy．

All the birds of prey lived with their burning eyes upon the gentle rodents of the land．The Somali here had their own position．Somalis are not good at being all on their own，they are very excitable，and，wherever they go，if they are left to themselves they will waste much time and blood over their tribal moral system．But they are fine seconds in command，and perhaps the Arab capitalists have often given them charge of daring undertakings and difficult transports while they stayed in Mombasa themselves．Therefore their relation to the Natives was nearly exactly that of the sheepdog to the sheep．They watched them untiringly，their sharp teeth bared．Would they die before the coast was reached？Would they escape？The Somali have a keen sense of money and values，they will have given up food and sleep for the sake of their charges，and must have come back from the expeditions worn to skin and bone．

The habit is in their blood still．When we had the Spanish flu on the farm，Farah was very ill with it himself，but he followed me about，all shivering with fever，to bring medicine to the squatters and to force it into them．He had been told that paraffin was very good against the disease，and therefore he bought paraffin for the farm．His little brother Abdullai，who was with us then，was very bad with flu，and Farah was much worried about him．Still，that was only the inclination of the heart，a frivolous matter．Duty，bread and reputation lay with the farm labour，and the dying sheepdog stuck to his job．Farah also had much insight in what was going on in Native circles，although I do not know from where he had his knowledge，for，with the exception of the biggest amongst them，he kept no company with the Kikuyu．

The sheep themselves，the patient nations，with no teeth or claws to them，no power and no earthly protector，got through their destiny，as they get through it now，on their immense gift for resignation．They did not die under the yoke，like the Masai，or storm against fate，as the Somali do when they believe themselves injured，cheated or slighted．They were friends with God in foreign countries，and in chains．They also kept up a peculiar self-feeling in their relations to those who persecuted them．They were aware that the profit and prestige of their tormentors lay with them themselves：they were the central figures in the chase and the commerce，they were the goods．Upon the long track of blood and tears，the sheep，deep in their dark dumb hearts had made for themselves a bobtailed philosophy，and thought not highly of the shepherds or the dogs．“You have no rest either day or night，”they said，“you run with your hot tongues out，panting，you are kept awake at night so that your dry eyes smart in the daytime，all on our account．You are here on our account．You exist for our sake，not we for your sake．”The Kikuyu of the farm at times had a flippant manner towards Farah，as a lamb may skip in the face of the sheepdog just to make him get up and run．

Farah and Kinanjui met here，the sheepdog and the old ram．Farah stood up erect in his red and blue turban，black embroidered Arab waistcoat and Arab silk robe，as thoughtful，decorous a figure as you would find anywhere in the world．Kinanjui was spreading himself on the stone seat，naked but for the mantle of monkey furs on his shoulders，an old Native，a clod of the soil of the African highlands．They treated each other with respect，although，when they had no direct dealings，in accordance with some ceremonial they pretended not to see one another．

It was easy to imagine the two，a hundred years earlier or more，holding a converse over a consignment of slaves，undesirable members of the tribe，of whom Kinanjui was ridding himself．Farah would be keeping，all the time，at the back of his mind the idea of swooping upon the old chief himself，a fat morsel，so as to have him included in his parcel．Kinanjui would follow，without fault，every one of Farah's thoughts，and，through the whole sitting，he would be carrying the weight of the situation，the weight，too，of his own scared and heavy heart．For he was the central figure，he was the goods．

The big meeting which was to settle the case of the shooting accident began in a peaceful spirit．The people of the farm were all pleased to see Kinanjui．The oldest squatters got up and came to exchange a few remarks with him，then walked back and took their seats on the grass．A couple of old women from the periphery of the assembly shrieked a greeting to me：“Jambo Jerie！”Jerie is a Kikuyu name．The old women of the farm addressed me by it，and the very small children made use of it as well，but the young people and the men never called me Jerie．Kaninu was present at the meeting，in the midst of his large family，like a scarecrow somehow called to life，with burning，attentive eyes．Wainaina and his mother came along and sat a little away from the others．

I told the people，slowly and in an effective manner，that the matter between Kaninu and Wainaina had been settled and the settlement put down on paper，Kinanjui had come over to certify it．Kaninu was to give Wainaina a cow with a heifer calf at foot，and by that the affair should be ended，since nobody could stand it any longer．

Kaninu and Wainaina had been informed of the decision beforehand，and Kaninu was instructed to have the cow and calf ready．The activities of Wainaina were of an underground nature，in the daylight he was like a mole above the ground，and looked as soft as a mole does there．

When I had read up the agreement I told Kaninu to bring along the cow．Kaninu got up and waved both arms up and down many times to two of his young sons，who were holding the cow behind the boys' huts．The ring opened while the cow and calf were slowly led into the middle of it．

At the same moment the atmosphere of the meeting changed，as when a thunderstorm comes up in the horizon，and quickly rises to zenith．

There is nothing in the world which to the Kikuyu holds the interest and importance of a cow with a heifer calf at foot．Bloodshed，witchcraft，sexual love，or the wonders of the white men's world，all evaporate and disappear near the great flaming furnace of their passion for live stock，which smells of the stone age，like a fire you strike with a flint．

Wainaina's mother broke into a long wail and shook a dry arm and finger at the cow．Wainaina joined her，all stuttering and breaking in his speech，as if someone else were speaking through him：he raised his voice to heaven．He would not accept the cow：she was the oldest in Kaninu's herd，and the calf that she had now got with her，that surely was the last which she would ever bear．

The clan of Kaninu cried out and cut him short in a furious staccato inventory of the qualities of the cow，behind which you felt a great bitterness，and contempt of death．

The people of the farm did not have it in them to remain silent where a cow and calf were being discussed．Everyone present gave out his opinion．The old men seized one another by the arm and shook out their last asthmatic breath in praise or condemnation of the cow．The shrill voices of their old women fell in and followed them up，as in a canon．The young men spat out short deadly remarks at one another in deep voices．In two or three minutes the open place by my house was boiling over like a witch's cauldron．

I looked towards Farah and he looked back at me，but like a man in a dream．I saw that he was a sword half-way out of the scabbard，which in a moment would be flashing right and left in the strife．For the Somali are themselves stock-owners and cattle traders．Kaninu threw me a glance like a drowning man，who is finally carried away by the current．I took a look at the cow．She was a grey cow with deeply curved horns，and was standing patiently in the very centre of the cyclone that she had raised．When all fingers were being pointed at her she began to lick her calf．I thought that she did have，somehow，the look of an old cow．

At last I turned my eyes back to Kinanjui．I do not know whether he had been looking at the cow at all．While I looked at him he did not even wince．He sat immovable，like some bulk without either intelligence or sympathies just set down by my house．He turned his side to the screaming crowd，and I realized how much the profile is the true face of a king．It is a Native faculty thus to transform yourself，in a single movement，into lifeless matter．I do not think that Kinanjui could have spoken or moved without fanning the flames of passion；as it was he kept sitting on them to quell them．Not everybody could have done it．

Little by little the fury died down，the people stopped shrieking and began to talk in an everyday manner；in the end they became silent one by one．Wainaina's mother，when she thought that nobody watched her，crawled a few steps on her stick to have a closer look at the cow．Farah turned and came back to civilization，with a little，wry smile．

When everything was quiet we made the parties in the case come round to the mill-stone table，dip their thumb in cart-grease，and press their thumb-mark down upon the document of the agreement．Wainaina did it very reluctantly，whimpering a little when he set his thumb to the paper，as if it was burning him．The agreement ran as follows：

The following agreement has been made at Ngong today，the 26th of September，between Wainaina wa Bemu and Kaninu wa Muture．The Chief Kinanjui is present here and sees it all．

The agreement states that Kaninu shall pay to Wainaina a cow with a heifer calf．This cow and heifer calf shall be given to Wainaina's son Wanyangerri，who was，on the 19th of December last year，shot by a shotgun which was fired by mistake by Kaninu's son Kabero．The cow and calf shall be the property of Wanyangerri．

With the payment of this cow and her heifer calf the Shaurie shall be finally settled．Nobody，after this，must speak of it or mention it at all．




Ngong，September，26th．

Wainaina's mark．

Kaninu's mark．



I was here and heard the document read．

The mark of the Chief Kinanjui．

The cow and heifer calf were handed over to Wainaina in my presence．

VISITORS TO THE FARM


“Post res perditas”





Big Dances


We had many visitors to the farm．In pioneer countries hospitality is a necessity of life not to the travellers alone but to the settlers．A visitor is a friend，he brings news，good or bad，which is bread to the hungry minds in lonely places．A real friend who comes to the house is a heavenly messenger，who brings the panis angelorum．

When Denys Finch-Hatton came back after one of his long expeditions，he was starved for talk，and found me on the farm starved for talk，so that we sat over the dinner-table into the small hours of the morning，talking of all the things we could think of，and mastering them all，and laughing at them．White people，who for a long time live alone with Natives，get into the habit of saying what they mean，because they have no reason or opportunity for dissimulation，and when they meet again their conversation keeps the Native tone．We then kept up the theory that the wild Masai tribe，in their Manyatta under the hills，would see the house all afire，like a star in the night，as the peasants of Umbria saw the house wherein Saint Francis and Saint Clare were entertaining one another upon theology．

The greatest social functions of the farm were the Ngomas—the big Native dances．At these occasions we entertained up to fifteen hundred or two thousand guests．The entertainment offered by the house was however in itself modest．We would give the old bald mothers of the dancing Morani and the Nditos—the maidens—snuff，and the children—at those dances to which children were brought—sugar，distributed by Kamante in wooden spoons，and I sometimes asked the D．C．'s permission for my squatters to make tembu，a deadly drink，fabricated from sugar cane．But the real performers，the indefatigable young dancers，brought the glory and luxury of the festivity with them，they were immune to foreign influence，and concentrated upon the sweetness and fire within themselves．One thing only did they demand from the outside world：a space of level ground to dance on．This was to be found near my house：the big lawn was plain under the trees，and the square in the forest between my boys' huts had been laid out level．For this reason the farm was highly thought of by the young people of the country，and the invitations to my balls much valued．

The Ngomas were held sometimes in the day and sometimes at night．In the day-time the Ngomas needed more room，since they brought with them as many onlookers as dancers；they therefore took place on the lawn．At most Ngomas the dancers stand in a large circle，or in a number of smaller circles，and there keep jumping up and down，the head thrown back，or stamping the ground to a rhythm，throwing themselves forward on one foot，and back on to the other，or again slowly and solemnly walking round sideways with their faces to the centre of the ring，the prominent dancers separating themselves from the ring，to perform，jump，and run in the middle of it．The day-time Ngomas left their mark stamped upon the lawn in larger and smaller dry brown rings，as if the grass had here been burnt away by fire，and these magic rings would only slowly disappear．

The big day-time Ngomas had the character more of a fair than of a ball．Crowds of onlookers followed the dancers and grouped themselves under the trees．When the rumour of the Ngoma had spread widely enough we would even see here the flighty ladies of Nairobi—the Malaya，a pretty word in Swaheli—arriving in style，in Ali Khan's mule-traps，all wrapped in lengths of gay large-patterned calico，and looking，when seated，like large flowers on the grass．The honest young girls on the farm in their traditional oiled and greased leather skirts and mantles，took up their position close to them，and frankly discussed their clothes and manners，but the beauties of the town，cross-legged，remained as quiet as glass-eyed dolls of dark wood，and smoked their little cigars．Swarms of children，enraptured by the dances，and keen to learn and imitate，stormed from one ring to another，or were carried away to form little dancing rings of their own on the outskirts of the lawn，and there jumped up and down．

The Kikuyu，when going to a Ngoma，rub themselves all over with a particular kind of pale red chalk，which is much in demand and is bought and sold；it gives them a strangely blond look．The colour is neither of the animal nor the vegetable world；in it the young people themselves look fossilized，like statues cut in rock．The girls in their demure，bead-embroidered，tanned leather garments cover these，as well as themselves，with the earth，and look all one with them—clothed statues in which the folds and draperies are daintily carried out by a skilled artist．The young men are naked for an Ngoma，but on such occasions make much out of their coiffures，clapping the chalk on to their manes and pigtails，and carrying their limestone heads high．During my last years in Africa，the Government forbade the people to put chalk on the head．In both sexes the rig out is of the greatest effect：diamonds and high decorations will not impart to their bearers a more decided gala appearance．Whenever at a distance you catch sight，in the landscape，of a group of red-chalked Kikuyu on the march，you feel the atmosphere vibrating with festivity．

An open-air dance in the day suffers from lack of limitation．The stage is far too big for it—where does it begin and where end？The small figures of the individual dancers may be all dyed，with the entire back-part of an ostrich floating behind their heads，and the bold cavalier-like cockspurs made of Colobus-monkey skin at the heels，they cannot help looking spread and scattered under the tall trees．The show—including larger and smaller rings of dancers，spread-out groups of onlookers，and children running to and fro—flings your eyes from one corner of it to the other．The whole scene has some likeness to those old pictures of a battle，observed from an eminence，in which you will see the cavalry advancing at one side，while the artillery takes up its position at the other，and isolated figures of ordnance officers gallop diagonally across the field of view．

The day-time Ngomas were likewise very noisy affairs．The dancing music from flutes and drums was often drowned in the clamour from the audience，the dancing girls themselves gave out a strange，long-drawn and shrill shriek when，in one of the figures executed by male dancers，a Moran made a jump，or swung his spear over his head，in an exceptionally fine manner．An unbroken stream of congenial conversation was kept up amongst the old people on the grass．It was pleasant here to watch a couple of ancient Kikuyu women carousing with a calabash between them，absorbed in gay talk，presumably of the days when they had themselves cut a figure in the dancing ring，their faces more and more radiant with happiness as，in the course of the afternoon，the sun sank lower，and the supply of tembu in the calabash as well．At times，when the group was joined by a couple of old husbands，one of the women would be so carried away by the memories of her young days that she stumbled to her feet and，flapping her arms，took a running step or two in the true Ndito manner．She was ignored by the crowd，but enthusiastically applauded by her little circle of contemporaries．

But the Ngomas of the night were set about in earnest．

They were held in the autumn only，after the maize-harvesting，and below the full moon．I do not think that they had any religious significance to them，but they may have had so once；the manner of the performers and onlookers suggested a mysterious and sacred moment．These dancers may have been a thousand years old．Some of them—which was highly approved of by the mothers and grandmothers of the dancers—were held by the white settlers to be immoral；they felt that they must have them prohibited by law．One time，when I came back from a holiday in Europe，I found that twenty-five of my young warriors had，in the height of the coffee-picking season，been sent to jail by my manager for having danced a forbidden dance at a night Ngoma on the farm．My Manager informed me that his wife could not possibly put up with the dance．I upbraided the elders of the squatters for having held their Ngoma near my manager's house，but they gravely explained to me that they had been dancing at Kathegu's manyatta，four or five miles away from it．I then had to go to Nairobi to talk matters over with our D．C．，who let the whole lot of dancers come back to the farm to pick coffee．

The night dances were fine spectacles．Here you were not in doubt as to the theatre of the show；it was formed by the fires and extended as far out as the light spread，indeed fire was the central principle of the Ngoma．It was not really needed for the dancing，for the moonlight of the African highlands is marvellously clear and white；it was brought to create an effect．The fire made of the dancing place a stage of the first order，it collected all the colours and movements within it into a unity．

Natives will rarely overdo an effect．They had no great flaming bonfires lighted．Firewood was carried to the dancing place during the day before the dance by the squatter women of the farm，who will have looked upon themselves as hostesses to the feast，and was here piled up in the centre of the dancing ring．The old women who honoured the ball with their presence at night took their seats round this central pile，and from there a row of small fires，like a circle of stars，were fed through the hours of the night．The dancers again were dancing and running outside the fires with the forest night as a background．The place had to be fairly big or the heat and smoke would get into the eyes of the old onlookers，but it was all the same an enclosed place in the world，as if it had been a large house for the joint use of all within it．

Natives have no sense or taste for contrasts；the umbilical cord of nature has，with them，not been quite cut through．They held their Ngomas only during the time of the full moon．When the moon did her best they did theirs．With the landscape bathing and swimming in gentle powerful light from the sky，to the great illumination over Africa they added their little red-hot glow．

The guests arrived in small parties，sometimes three at a time，sometimes a dozen or fifteen—friends who came together by appointment，or who had joined company on the road．Many of these dancers had walked fifteen miles to get to the Ngoma．When travelling many together they brought flutes or drums with them，so that，on the night of the big dance，all the roads and pathways of the country would resound and ring with music，like jingles shaken at the face of the moon．At the entrance to the dancing ring the wanderers paused and waited for the ring to open to them；sometimes，when they came from very far away，or were sons of the big neighbouring Chiefs，they were received into it by one of the old squatters or prominent dancers of the farm，or by the monitors of the dance．

The monitors of the Ngoma were young men from the farm like the others，but they were there to keep up the ceremonial of the dance，and made the most of their position．Before the dancing began，they strutted up and down in front of the dancers with knitted brows and a grave face；as the dance grew livelier they ran from one side of the ring to another，to watch that everything was going as it should．They were effectively armed，carrying bundles of sticks tied together，the one end of which they kept burning，by dipping them from time to time into the fire．They kept a sharp eye upon the dancers，and wherever they espied anything of an unseemly nature going on，they were at them at once；with a terrible expression and a furious snarl they hurled their whole bunch of sticks，the burning end foremost，straight at the body of the offender．The victim was seen to be bent double at the stroke，but he never gave a sound．Perhaps a burn of this kind was no dishonourable wound to be carrying away from a Ngoma．

In one of the dances the girls would stand demurely upon the feet of the young men and clasp them round the waist，while the young warriors with an outstretched arm at each side of the girl's head，held on to their spear with both hands，from time to time lifting it and striking it down to the ground with all their might．It made a pretty picture，of the young women of the tribe having taken refuge at the bosom of their men against some great danger，and of the men guarding them，even by letting them stand on their feet，protecting them against snakes or any other dangers from the ground．As the dance went on for hours the faces of the dancers took on an expression of angelic ecstasy，as if they were really all ready to die for one another．

They had other dances in which the dancers ran in and out amongst the fires，where one head-dancer made a number of very high jumps and leaps，and there was much swinging of spears；it was，I believe，built upon a lion hunt．

They had singers at the Ngoma，as well as flutes and drums．Some of these singers were famous all over the country，and were made to come from far away．Their singing was more a rhythmical recitation than a song．They were improvisers，and made up their ballads off-hand，with the quick，attentive chorus of the dancers joining in．It was pleasant to listen，in the night air，to the one gentle voice being raised，and to the regularly repeated，measured call of young voices．But as it went on all night，with the drums falling in for an effect from time to time，it became both deadly monotonous and strangely excruciating to hear，as if you could not bear either to have it going on for one moment longer，or to have it ever stopped．

The most famous singer of my day came from Dagoretti．He had a clear strong voice and was，besides，himself a great dancer．When singing he would walk or run inside the dancing ring in a long-sliding stride，half-kneeling at every step；he held the one flat hand to the corner of his mouth；it was probably done to concentrate the sound，but it gave effect of a great dangerous secret being confided to the congregation．He looked like the African echo itself．He used to move his audience to happiness or to a warlike mood as he chose，or to real convulsions of laughter．He sang one formidable song，a war song，in which the singer is，I believe，imagined running from village to village calling the nation to war，and describing to them the massacre and the loot．A hundred years ago it would have made the blood of the white immigrants run cold．But generally he was not so terrifying．One night he sang three songs，which I asked Kamante to translate to me．The first of them was a fantasy：the whole party of the dancers were imagined getting hold of a ship and sailing to Volaia．The second song，Kamante explained to me．was all in praise of the old women，the mothers and grandmothers of the singer and the dancers．This song sounded sweet to me：it was long，and must have described in detail the wisdom and kindness of the toothless bald old Kikuyu wives，who listened at the pile of firewood in the centre of the place，and nodded their heads．The third song was short，but drew great shouts of laughter from everybody；the singer had to raise his shrill voice to be heard through it，and laughed himself as he sang．The old women，who had now been put in good humour by being so strongly flattered，beat their thighs，and threw up big gapes，like crocodiles，at it．Kamante was loth to translate it to me，he said it was nonsense，and gave it me only very much shortened．The theme of it was simple：after a recent epidemic of plague，the Government had set a price upon each dead rat handed into the D．C．s—the song described how the rats，universally pursued，were taking refuge in the beds of the old and young women of the tribe，and what happened to them there．It must have been amusing in its details，which I did not get；Kamante himself，while translating it to me very much against his wish，at times could not repress a sour smile．

At one of the night Ngomas a dramatic incident took place．

The Ngoma was a farewell feast，given in my honour a short time before I was going to Europe on a visit．We had had a good year：it was held in great style，there may have been fifteen hundred Kikuyu present．The dance had been going on for a few hours；as I came out to have another look at it before going to bed，a chair was placed for me with its back to one of the boys' huts，and I was entertained by a couple of the old squatters．

All at once a great stir ran through the ring of dancers，a deep movement of surprise or fear，a curious sound，as when the wind blows through a bed of rushes．The dance slowed up，slowed up，but it did not stop yet．I asked one of the old men what was the matter．He answered quickly，in a low voice：“Masai na-kudja，”—the Masai are coming．

The news must have been brought by a runner，for it lasted some time before anything more happened；probably the Kikuyu were sending back to say that their guests would be received．It was against the law for the Masai to come to a Kikuyu Ngoma，too much trouble had arisen from this kind of thing in the past．My houseboys came up and stood by my chair；everybody looked towards the entrance of the dancing ground．When the Masai camein，the dance stopped altogether．

There were twelve young Masai warriors walking in，and when they had taken a few steps they stopped，waited，and looked neither right nor left；they blinked a little towards the fire．They were naked except for their weapons and their magnificent head-dresses．One of them had on the lion-skin head dress of the Moran at war．A broad stripe of scarlet was painted vertically from the knee to the foot，as if the blood was running down the leg．They stood erect，stiff-legged，their heads thrown back，silent and deadly grave；their attitude was at the same time that of the conqueror and the prisoner．It was felt that they had come to the Ngoma against their own will．The dull beating of the drum had run across the river into the Reserve，had gone on，and gone on，and troubled the hearts of the young warriors there；twelve of them had not had it in them to resist the call．

The Kikuyu were deeply agitated，too，but they behaved well to their guests．The chief dancer of the farm welcomed them into the dancing ring，where in deep silence they took their place，and the dance was begun once more．It was，however，different from what it had been before，the air was loaded now．The drums began to beat in a louder voice，and a more rapid rhythm．Had the Ngoma gone on，we should have seen some striking feats，when Kikuyu and Masai would have taken upon themselves to show one another their vigour and skill as dancers．But it did not come to that：there are things which can not be carried through even with the good will of everybody concerned．

What happened I do not know．All of a sudden the ring swayed，and was broken，someone shrieked aloud：in some seconds the whole place before me was a mass of running，thronging people，there was the sound of blows and of bodies falling to the ground，and over our heads the night air was undulating with spears．We all got up，even the wise old women of the centre，who crawled on to the stacks of firewood to see what was going on．

When the emotion had calmed down，and the storming crowd had dissolved again，I found myself in the centre of the swarm，with a little cleared space round me．Two of the old squatters came up to me，and reluctantly explained what had happened：the violation of law and order committed by the Masai，and the present state of things：a Masai and three Kikuyu were badly wounded，“cut to pieces，”their expression was．Would I now，they went on gravely，consent to sew them up again？—otherwise everybody was likely to get much trouble from the Selikali—the Government．I asked the old man what the fighters had had cut off．“The head，”he answered proudly，with the Native instinct to make the most of a catastrophe．At that moment Kamante was seen to advance across the place，carrying a long-threaded darning needle，and my thimble．I still hesitated，and at that moment old Awaru came forward．He had learned tailoring during the seven years that he had been in prison．He must have been looking for an opportunity for practising，and showing off his craft，he volunteered to take charge of the case，and at once the interest concentrated upon him．He did indeed sew up the wounded，they got well under his hands，and he himself in after times made much of the achievement，but Kamante told me in confidence that the heads had not been off．

As the presence of the Masai at the dance had been illegal，we for a long time had to conceal the wounded Masai in the hut reserved for white visitors' servants．Here he recovered and from here in the end he disappeared without a word of thanks to Awaru．It comes hard，I believe，to the heart of a Masai to be wounded—and healed—by Kikuyu．

When towards the end of the night of the Ngoma，I walked out to ask for news of the wounded people，I found，in the grey morning air，the fires still smouldering．A number of young Kikuyu were in action round them，leaping and poking long sticks into the embers，under the direction of a very old squatter wife，Wainaina's mother．They were making a spell to prevent the Masai from having any success in love with the Kikuyu girls．





A Visitor from Asia


The Ngomas were neighbourly and traditionally social functions．In the course of time，it was the younger brothers and sisters and，later on，the sons and daughters of the first dancers known to me，who came to the dancing ground．

But we had visitors from distant countries as well．The monsoon blows from Bombay：wise and experienced old people travelled in ships，all the way from India，and came to the farm．

There was in Nairobi a big Indian timber merchant by the name of Choleim Hussein，with whom I had done many deals when I was first clearing my land and who was a zealous Mohammedan and a friend of Farah's．One day he arrived at the house and asked for permission to bring a High Priest from India on a visit．He was coming all over the sea，Choleim Hussein told me，to inspect his congregations of Mombasa and Nairobi：the congregations on their side were eager to entertain him well，and，working their brains，they could think of nothing better than this visit to the farm．Would I let him come？When I said that he should be welcome，Choleim Hussein went on to explain that the rank and holiness of the old man were such that he could eat nothing which had been cooked in pots ever used by infidels．But I need not bother about that，he quickly added，the Mohammedan congregation of Nairobi would prepare the meal and send it out in good time；would I only let the High Priest partake of it in my house？As I agreed，Choleim Hussein after a little while took up the matter again，with difficulty．There was one more point，only one．Wherever the High Priest went，etiquette demanded that he should receive a present，in a house like mine it could be no less than one hundred rupees．But I need not let that worry me，he hurried to explain，the money had been collected amongst the Mohammedans of Nairobi，who only asked me to hand it over to the Priest．But would the Priest，I asked，believe it to be a present from me？Of this I could extract no explanation from Choleim Hussein；there are times when coloured people cannot make themselves clear to save their lives．At first I declined the role intended for me，but looking at the disappointed faces of Choleim Hussein and Farah，which had a moment before been radiant with hope，I gave up my pride and thought that I would let the High Priest think what he liked．

On the day of the visit I had forgotten about it and gone out in the field to try my new tractor．Titi，Kamante's little brother，was sent out to me there．The tractor made such a noise that I could not hear what he had got to say，and it was so difficult to start that I dared not stop it；Titi ran alongside of it all through the field like a small mad dog，panting and snapping in the deep ground and the long thick trail of dust，until at the end of the field we came to a pause．“The Priests have come，”he roared to me．“What Priests？”I asked back．“All the Priests，”he proudly explained；they had arrived in four carts，six in each．I went with him back to the house，and as I got near I caught sight of a swarm of white-robed figures spread on the lawn，as if a flight of big white birds had settled round my house，or a company of angels swooped on to the farm．It will have been a whole Spiritual Court sent from India to keep up the flame of orthodoxy in Africa．There was，however，no mistaking the dignified figure of the High Priest as he advanced towards me，escorted by two subordinates，and，at a respectful distance，by Choleim Hussein．He was a very short old man with a delicate，refined face，as if carved in very old ivory．The retinue drew near，to stand guard upon our meeting，and then withdraw；I was expected to entertain my guest alone．

We could not speak a word to one another，for he understood neither English nor Swaheli，and I did not know his language．We had to express our great mutual respect by pantomime．He had already，I saw，been shown the house．All the plate that it possessed was set out on the table，and flowers arranged according to Indian and Somali taste．I went and sat down with him on the stone seat to the west．There，under the breathless attention of the onlookers，I handed him over the hundred rupees which were wrapped up in a green handkerchief belonging to Choleim Hussein．

I had somehow been prejudiced against the old Priest on account of his preciseness—on seeing him so very old and small I，for a moment，thought that the situation might be awkward to him．But as we sat together in the afternoon sun，in no way pretending to keep up any conversation，but holding one another company in a friendly spirit，I felt that to him nothing at all could be awkward．He conveyed a strange impression of being in safety，and completely secure．He had a courteous little manner with him，and smiled and nodded，as I pointed out the hills and the tall trees to him，as if he were interested in everything，and incapable of surprise at anything．I wondered if this consistency was produced by an entire ignorance of the evil of the world，or by a deep knowledge and acceptance of it．For whether there be no venomous snakes in the world，or whether you shall have arrived，by injecting ever-stronger doses of venom into your blood，at a stage of perfect immunity to it，in the end it must come to the same thing．The look of the old man's calm face was that of a very young infant，which has not yet learnt to speak，and which is interested in everything，and by the nature of things incapable of surprise．I might have sat，on the stone seat，through an hour of the afternoon，in the company of a very small child，a noble infant，some old Master's child Jesus—from time to time touching the rocker of the cradle with a spiritual foot．The faces of very old women of the world，who have seen all of it，and through it，will have that same look．It is not a masculine expression—it goes with the swaddling clothes and the woman's frock，and went well with the beautiful white cashmere robes of my old guest．In a person in male clothes I have seen it only in a clever clown in a circus．

The old man was tired，and would not get up，while the other Priests were taken by Choleim Hussein down to the river to see the mill．As he was like a bird himself he seemed to take an interest in birds．I had at that time a tame stork by the house，and I kept a flock of geese which were never killed，but were there to make the place look like Denmark．The old Priest showed much interest in them；by pointing to the corners of the world he tried to find out from where they came．My dogs were on the lawn，to make the millennium character of the afternoon perfect．I had thought that Farah and Choleim Hussein would have had them shut up in the kennel，for Choleim Hussein，as a true Mohammedan，was all in a panic about them whenever he came to the farm to do business．But here they were walking about，amongst the white-robed clergy，indeed the lion by the lamb．Those were the dogs supposed by Ismail to know a Mohammedan by sight．

Before he went away the High Priest gave me，in memory of his visit，a ring with a pearl．I felt then that I，too，wanted to give him something，in addition to the sham gift of the rupees，and I sent Farah to the store to fetch the skin of a lion which had a short time ago been shot on the farm．The old man took hold of one of the big claws，and with a clear attentive eye tried the sharpness of it on his cheek．

After he had gone away，I wondered whether he had taken into his lean，noble head every single thing within the horizon of the farm，or nothing whatever．Something he had noticed，for three months later I had a letter from India，very wrongly addressed and delayed in the post．In it an Indian prince asked me to sell to him one of my“grey dogs”，of which a High Priest had made mention to him，and to fix my own price．





The Somali Women


Of one group of visitors，who played a great part on the farm，I cannot write much，for they would not have liked it．Those were Farah's women．

When Farah married，and brought his wife from Somaliland to the farm，with her came a lively and gentle little flight of dusky doves：her mother，her younger sister，and a young cousin who had been brought up with the family．Farah told me that such was the custom of his country．The marriages of Somaliland are arranged by the elders of the families with consideration as to the birth，wealth and reputation of the young people；in the best families the bride and bridegroom have not seen one another till the wedding day．But the Somali are a chivalrous nation，and do not leave their maidens unprotected．It is good manners in a new-married husband to take up his abode in his wife's village for six months after the wedding；during this time she may still hold her own as a hostess and a person of local knowledge and influence．Sometimes he cannot do so；then the bride's female relations do not hesitate to keep her company a bit into married life，even when this to them means lifting，and wandering into distant countries．

The circle of Somali women in my household was later completed by a little motherless girl of the tribe whom Farah took on，not，I think，without an eye to a likely profit when her time to marry should come，after the pattern of Mordecai and Esther．This little girl was an exceedingly bright and vivacious child，and it was a curious thing to see how，as she grew up，the maidens took her in hand，and scrupulously formed her into a young virgin comme il faut．When she first came to live with us she was eleven years old，and was ever breaking away from the domain of the family to follow me about．She rode my pony and carried my gun，or she would run with the Kikuyu Totos to the fishing pond，tucking up her skirts and galloping barefooted round the rushy bank with a landing-net．The little Somali girls have their hair all shaven off，leaving only a ring of dark curls round the head and one long lock at the top of it；it is a pretty fashion，and it gave the child the air of a very gay and malicious young monk．But with time，and under the influence of the grown-up girls，she was transformed，and was herself fascinated and possessed by the process of her transformation．Exactly as if a heavy weight had been tied on to her legs，she took to walking slowly，slowly；she held her eyes cast down after the best pattern，and made it a point of honour to disappear at the arrival of a stranger．Her hair was cut no more，and when the day came that it was long enough，it was，by the other girls，parted and plaited into a number of little pigtails．The novice gave herself up gravely and proudly to all the hardships of the rite；it was felt that she would rather die than fall short in her duties towards it．

The old woman，Farah's mother-in-law，was，Farah told me，in her own country held in high esteem on account of the excellent education which she had given her daughters．They were there the glass of fashion and the mould of maidenly form．Indeed here were three young women of the most exquisite dignity and demureness．I have never known ladies more ladylike．Their maiden modesty was accentuated by the style of their clothes．They wore skirts of imposing amplitude；it took，I know—for I have often bought silk or calico for them—ten yards of material to make one of them．Inside these masses of stuff their slim knees moved in an insinuating and mysterious rhythm：

Tes nobles jambes，sous les volants qu'elles chassent，

Tourmentent les desirs obscurs et les agacent，

Comme deux sorcierès qui font

Toumer un philtre noir dans un vase profond．



The mother herself was an impressive figure，very stout，with the powerful and benevolent placidity of a female elephant，contented in her strength．I have never seen her angry．Teachers and pedagogues ought to have envied her that great inspiring quality which she had in her；in her hands education was no compulsion，and no drudgery，but a great noble conspiracy into which her pupils were by privilege admitted．The little house，that I had built for them in the woods，was a small High-school of White Magic，and the three young girls，who walked so gently upon the forest paths round it，were like three young witches who were studying at it as hard as they could，for at the end of their apprenticeship great mightiness would be theirs．They were competing in excellency in a congenial spirit；probably where you are in reality upon the market，and have your price openly discussed，rivalry takes on a frank and honest character．Farah's wife，who was no longer in suspense as to her price，was holding a special position，like that of the good pupil who has already obtained a scholarship in witchcraft；she might be observed in confidential talks with the old head magician，and such an honour never fell to the maidens．

All the young women had a high idea of their own value．A Mohammedan virgin cannot marry beneath her，such a thing would call down the gravest blame upon her family．A man may marry beneath him—that is good enough for him—and young Somalis have been known to take Masai wives．But while a Somali girl may marry into Arabia，an Arab girl cannot marry into Somaliland，for the Arabs are the superior race on account of their nearer relationship with the Prophet，and，amongst the Arabs themselves，a maiden belonging to the Prophet's family cannot marry a husband outside it．By virtue of their sex，the young females of the race have a claim to an upward social career．They themselves innocently compared the principle to that of a stud-farm of purebreds，for the Somali think very highly of mares．

By the time that we had become well acquainted，the girls asked me if it could be true what they had heard，that some nations in Europe gave away their maidens to their husbands for nothing．They had even been told，but they could not possibly realize the idea，that there was one tribe so depraved as to pay the bridegroom to marry the bride．Fie and shame on such parents，and on girls who gave themselves up to such treatment．Where was their self-respect，where their respect for woman，or for virginity？If they themselves had had the misfortune to be born into that tribe，the girls told me，they would have vowed to go into their grave unmarried．

In our days we have in Europe no opportunity to study the technique of maidenly prudery，and from the old books I had failed to catch the charm of it．Now I understood how my grandfather and great-grandfather were forced to their knees．The Somali system was at once a natural necessity and a fine art，it was both religion，strategy，and ballet，and was practised in all respects with due devotion，discipline and dexterity．The great sweetness of it lay in the play of opposite forces within it．Behind the eternal principle of refutation，there was much generosity；behind the pedantry what risibility，and contempt of death．These daughters of a fighting race went through their ceremonial of primness as through a great graceful war-dance；butter would not melt in their mouth，neither would they rest till they had drunk the heart's blood of their adversary；they figured like three ferocious young she wolves in seemly sheep's clothing．The Somali are wiry people，hardened in deserts and on the sea．Heavy weights of life，strenuous pressure，high waves，and long ages，must have gone to turn their women into such hard，shining amber．

The women made Farah's house home-like in the manner of a nomadic people，who may have to break their tents at any time，with many rugs and embroidered covers hung on the walls．Incense to them was an important component to a home；many of the Somali incenses are very sweet．In my life at the farm I saw few women，and I got into the habit of sitting，at the end of the day，for a quiet hour with the old woman and the girls in Farah's house．

They took an interest in everything，and little things pleased them．Small mishaps on the farm，and jokes on our local affairs，set them laughing like a whole chime of jingles in the house．When I was to teach them to knit they laughed over it as over a comical puppet-show．

There was no ignorance in their innocence．They had all assisted at childbirths and death-beds，and discussed the particulars of them coldly with the old mother．Sometimes，to entertain me，they would relate fairy tales in the style of the Arabian Nights，mostly in the comical genre，which treated love with much frankness．It was a trait common to all these tales that the heroine，chaste or not，would get the better of the male characters and come out of the tale triumphant．The mother sat and listened with a little smile on her face．

Within this enclosed women's world，so to say，behind the walls and fortifications of it，I felt the presence of a great ideal，without which the garrison would not have carried on so gallantly；the idea of a Millennium when women were to reign supreme in the world．The old mother at such times would take on a new shape，and sit enthroned as a massive dark symbol of that mighty female deity who had existed in old ages，before the time of the prophet's God．Of her they never lost sight，but they were，before all，practical people with an eye on the needs of the movement and with infinite readiness of resource．

The young women were very inquisitive as to European customs，and listened attentively to descriptions of the manners，education，and clothes of white ladies，as if out to complete their strategic education with the knowledge of how the males of an alien race were conquered and subdued．

Their own clothes played a tremendous part in their lives，which was no wonder，since to them they were all at once material of war，booty of war，and symbols of victory，like conquered banners．Their husband，the Somali，is abstinent by nature，indifferent to food and drink and to personal comfort，hard and spare as the country he comes from：woman is his luxury．For her he is insatiably covetous，she is to him the supreme good of life：horses，camels and stock may come in and be desirable，too，but they can never outweigh the wives．The Somali women encourage their men in both inclinations of their nature．They scorn any softness in a man with much cruelty；and with great personal sacrifices they hold up their own price．These women cannot acquire a pair of slippers in any possible way except through a man，they cannot own themselves but must needs belong to some male，to a father，a brother or a husband，but they are still the one supreme prize of life．It is a surprising thing，and to the honour of both parties，what amounts of silks，gold，amber and coral the Somali women get out of their men．At the end of the long，strenuous trading safaris，the hardships，risks，stratagems and endurances were all turned into female apparel．The young girls，who had no men to squeeze，in their little tent-like house were making the most of their pretty hair and looking forward to the time when they should be conquering the conqueror，and extorting from the extortioner．They were all very good at lending one another their finery，and took pleasure in dressing up the young sister，who was the beauty of the lot，in her married sister's best clothes；even，with laughter，in her cloth-of-gold head-dress，which the virgin could not lawfully wear．

The Somali are given to law-suits and long feuds，and we were hardly ever without a case that needed Farah's frequent presence in Nairobi，or meetings of the tribe at the farm．At such times the old woman，when I came to the house，would pump me on the cases in a gentle and intelligent manner．She might have questioned Farah，who would have told her all she wanted to know，for he had a great respect for her．But she took the other course，I believe，from diplomacy．In this way she could still maintain，should it suit her，a woman's ignorance of men's affairs，and a womanly incapability to understand a single word of them．If she gave advice it should be uttered in Sibylline fashion，divinely inspired，and nobody should ever hold her to account．

At these big meetings of the Somali at the farm or at the great religious celebrations，the women had much to do with the arrangement and the food．They were not themselves present at the banquet，and they could not go into the Mosque，but they were ambitious as to the success and splendour of the party，and did not even amongst themselves let out what in their hearts they thought of it all．On these occasions they so strongly reminded me of the ladies of a former generation in my own country，that in my mind I saw them in bustles and long narrow trains．Not otherwise did the Scandinavian women of the days of my mothers and grandmothers—the civilized slaves of good-natured barbarians—do the honours at those tremendous sacred masculine festivals：the pheasant-shoots and great battues of the autumn season．

The Somali have been slave-owners for innumerable generations，and their women got on well with the Natives and with them had an unconcerned placid way．To the Native，service with the Somali and the Arab is less difficult than with the white people，for the tempo of life of the coloured races is everywhere the same．Farah's wife was popular with the Kikuyu of the farm，and Kamante many times told me that she was very clever．

With those of my white friends who frequently came to stay at the farm，like Berkeley Cole and Denys Finch-Hatton，the young Somali women were friendly；they frequently talked of them and knew a surprising lot about them．They conversed with them，when they met，in a sisterly manner，their hands in the folds of their skirts．But the relations were complicated because both Berkeley and Denys had Somali servants，and those the girls could not，for the life of them，meet．No sooner had Jama or Bilea，turbaned，lean and dark-eyed，shown themselves on the farm，than my young Somali women were gone from the face of it，not a bubble showing where they had sunk．If during these times they wanted to see me，they came sneaking round the corners of the house，drawing one of their skirts together over their faces．The Englishmen said that they were pleased by the confidence shown them，but in their hearts，I believe，a little cold wind blew at the consciousness of being thought so harmless．

I sometimes took the girls out for a drive or a visit；I was careful then to question the mother as to the correctness of it，for I would not begrime names that were as fresh as Dian's visage．To the one side of the farm lived a young Australian married woman who was for a few years a charming neighbour to me；she would ask the Somali girls over for tea．Those were great occasions．They then dressed up as pretty as a bouquet of flowers，and as we were driving along，the car behind me twittered like an aviary．They took the greatest interest in the house，the clothes，even—as he was seen riding or ploughing in the distance—in the husband of my friend．As tea was served，it came out that it was only the married sister and the children who could partake of it，to the young girls it was forbidden as too exciting．They had to content themselves with cakes and did so demurely，with a good grace．There was some discussion about the little girl，who was with us—could she still drink tea，or had she reached an age to which it would prove too dangerous？The married sister held that she might have it，but the child gave us a deep，dark，proud glance，and rejected the cup．

The cousin was a pensive girl with red-brown eyes，she could read Arabic and knew passages of the Koran by heart．She was of a theological turn of mind，and we had many religious discussions and talks about the wonders of the world．From her I learned the true paraphrase of the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife．She would admit Jesus Christ to have been born of a virgin，but not as the son of God，for God could have no sons in the flesh．Mariammo，who was the loveliest of maidens，had been walking in the garden，and a great angel，sent by the Lord，with his wingfeather had touched her shoulder：from this she conceived．In the course of our debates I one day showed her a picture postcard of Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ，in the Cathedral of Copenhagen．Upon that she fell in love，in a gentle and ecstatic way，with the Saviour．She could never hear enough about him，she sighed and changed colour as I narrated．About Judas she was much concerned—what sort of man was he，how could there be people like that—she herself would be only too happy to scratch out his eyes．It was a great passion，in the nature of the incense which they burned in their houses，and which，made from dark wood grown upon distant mountains，is sweet and strange to our senses．

I asked the French Fathers if I might bring my party of young Mohammedan women to the mission，and when they agreed in their friendly lively manner—pleased that something was going to happen—we one afternoon drove over to them，and one by one solemnly entered the cool church．The young women had never been in such a lofty building．As they looked up they held their hands over their heads to protect themselves should it fall down upon them．There were statues in the church，and，with the exception of the picture postcard，they had never in their lives seen anything like them．At the French mission there is a life-size statue of the Virgin，all in white and light blue，with a lily in her hand，and beside her another of St．Joseph with the infant on his arm．The girls were struck dumb in front of them，the beauty of the Virgin made them sigh．Of St．Joseph they knew already，and they thought highly of him，for being such a loyal husband and protector to the Virgin，now they gave him deep thankful glances because he carried the child for his wife as well．Farah's wife，who was then expecting her child，kept near the Holy Family all the time she stayed in the church．The Fathers prided themselves much on their church windows，which were done up in a paper imitation of stained glass，and represented the passion of Christ．The young cousin became all lost and absorbed in these windows，she walked round the church with her eyes on them，wringing her hands，her own knees bending as under the weight of the cross．On the way home they said very little；they were afraid，I believe，to betray their ignorance by any questions they might make．Only a couple of days later did they ask me if the Fathers could make the Virgin or St．Joseph come down from their plinths．

The young cousin was married from the farm，in a pretty bungalow which was then empty，and which I lent to the Somalis for the occasion．The wedding was a splendid affair and lasted for seven days．I was present at the head ceremony，when a procession of women，all singing，led the bride to meet the singing procession of men who brought the bridegroom to her．She had never seen him till then，and I wondered if she had imagined him in the likeness of Thorvaldsen's Christ，or if she would have had two ideals，a heavenly and an earthly love，on the model of the romances of chivalry．In the course of the week I drove over there more than once．At whatever hour I arrived I found the house ringing with festive life and fumigated with wedding incense．Sword-dances，and great dances of the women，went with a swing；big deals in cattle were done amongst the old men，guns were fired and mule-traps from town were arriving or leaving．At night，in the light of hurricane-lamps on the verandah，the loveliest dyes of Arabia and Somaliland were going in and out of the carts and the house：carmoisin，prune pure，Sudan brown，rose bengale，and saffranine．

Farah's son was born on the farm，Ahamed，whom they called Saufe，which means，I believe，a saw．In his heart there was none of the timidity of the Kikuyu children．When he was a tiny infant，swaddled like an acorn，with hardly any body to his dark round head，he sat up erect，and looked you straight in the face：it was like holding a small falcon on your hand，a lion-cub on the knee．He had inherited his mother's gaiety of heart，and，when he could run about，became a big joyful adventurer who held much influence in the young Native world of the farm．





Old Knudsen


Sometimes visitors from Europe drifted into the farm like wrecked timber into still waters，turned and rotated，till in the end they were washed out again，or dissolved and sank．

Old Knudsen，the Dane，had come to the farm，sick and blind，and stayed there for the time it took him to die，a lonely animal．He walked along the roads all bent over his misery；for long periods he was without speech，for he had no strength left over from the hard task of carrying it，or，when he spoke，his voice，like the voice of the wolf or hyena，was in itself a wail．

But when he recovered breath，and for a little while was without pain，then sparks flew from the dying fire once more．He would then come to me and explain how he had got to fight with a morbid melancholic disposition in himself，an absurd tendency to see things black．It must be outreasoned，for the outward circumstances they were not amiss，they were，the devil take him，not to be despised．Only pessimism，pessimism—that was a bad vice！

It was Knudsen who advised me to burn charcoal and sell it to the Indians of Nairobi，at a time when we were，on the farm，more than usually hard up．There were thousands of rupees in it，he assured me．And it could not fail under the aegis of Old Knudsen，for he had，at one time of his tumultuous career，been to the utmost north of Sweden，and there had learned the craft at his finger's end．He took upon himself to instruct the Natives in the art．While we were thus working together in the wood I talked much with Knudsen．

Charcoal-burning is a pleasant job．There is undoubtedly something intoxicating about it，and it is known that charcoal-burners see things in a different light from other people；they are given to poetry and taradiddle，and wood-demons come and keep them company．Charcoal is a beautiful thing to turn out，when your kiln is burnt and opened up，and the contents spread on the ground．Smooth as silk，matter defecated，freed of weight and made imperishable，the dark experienced little mummy of the wood．

The mise en scène of the art of charcoal-burning is in itself as lovely as possible．As we were cutting down the undergrowth only—for charcoal cannot be made from thick timber—we were still working under the crowns of the tall trees．In this stillness and shade of the African forest，the cut wood smelt like goose berries；and the piercing，fresh，rank，sour smell of the burning kiln was as bracing as a sea breeze．The whole place had a theatrical atmosphere which，under the equator，where there are no theatres，was of infinite charm．The thin blue whirls of smoke from the kilns arose at regular distances，and the dark kilns themselves looked like tents on the stage；the place was a smugglers' or soldiers' camp in a romantic opera．The dark figures of the Natives moved noiselessly amongst them．Where the under woods have been cleared away in an African forest you will always get a great number of butterflies，which seem to like to cluster on the stubs．It was all mysterious and innocent．In the surroundings，the small crooked form of Old Knudsen fitted in wonderfully well，flickering about，red-topped，agile，now that he had got a favourite job to attend to，sneering and encouraging，like a puck grown old and blind and very malicious．He was conscientious about his work and surprisingly patient with his Native pupils．We did not always agree．In Paris，where as a girl I went to a painting school，I had learnt that olive-wood will make the best charcoal，but Knudsen explained that olive had no knots in it，and，seven thousand devils in hell，every one knew that the heart of things was in their knots．

A particular circumstance here in the wood soothed Knudsen's hot temper．The African trees have a delicate foliage，mostly digitate，so that when you have cleared away the dense undergrowth，so to say hollowing out the forest，the light is like the light in a beechwood in May at home，when the leaves are just unfolded，or hardly unfolded yet．I drew Knudsen's attention to the likeness，and the idea pleased him，for all the time of the charcoal-burning he kept up and developed a fantasy：we were on a Whit Sunday picnic in Denmark．An old hollow tree he christened Lottenburg，after a place of amusement near Copenhagen．When I had a few bottles of Danish beer hidden in the depths of Lottenburg，and invited him to a drink there，he condescended to think it a good joke．

When we had all our kilns lighted we sat down and talked of life．I learned much about Knudsen's past life，and the strange adventures that had fallen to him wherever he had wandered．You had，in these conversations，to talk of Old Knudsen himself，the one righteous man—or you would sink into that black pessimism against which he was warning you．He had experienced many things：shipwrecks，plague，fishes of unknown colouring，drinking-spouts，water-spouts，three contemporaneous suns in the sky，false friends，black villainy，short successes，and showers of gold that instantly dried up again．One strong feeling ran through his Odyssey：the abomination of the law，and all its works，and all its doings．He was a born rebel，he saw a comrade in every outlaw．A heroic deed meant to him in itself an act of defiance against the law．He liked to talk of kings and royal families，jugglers，dwarfs and lunatics，for them he took to be outside the law—and also of any crime，revolution，trick，and prank，that flew in the face of the law．But for the good citizen he had a deep contempt，and law abidingness in any man was to him the sign of a slavish mind．He did not even respect，or believe in，the law of gravitation，which I learnt while we were felling trees together：he saw no reason why it should not be—by unprejudiced，enterprising people—changed into the exact reverse．

Knudsen was eager to imprint on my mind the names of people he had known，preferably of swindlers and scoundrels．But he never in his narrations mentioned the name of a woman．It was as if time had swept his mind both of Elsinore's sweet girls，and of the merciless women of the harbour towns of the world．All the same，when I was talking with him I felt in his life the constant presence of an unknown woman．I cannot say who she may have been：wife，mother，school-dame or wife of his first employer—in my thoughts I called her Madam Knudsen．I imagined her short because he was so short himself．She was the woman who ruins the pleasure of man，and therein is always right．She was the wife of the curtain-lectures，and the housewife of the big cleaning-days，she stopped all enterprises，she washed the faces of boys，and snatched away the man's glass of gin from the table before him，she was law and order embodied．In her claim of absolute power she had some likeness to the female deity of the Somali women，but Madam Knudsen did not dream of enslaving by love，she ruled by reasoning and righteousness．Knudsen must have met her at a young age，when his mind was soft enough to receive an ineffaceable impression．He had fled from her to the sea，for the sea she loathes，and there she does not come，but ashore again in Africa he had not escaped her，she was still with him．In his wild heart，under his white-red hair，he feared her more than he feared any man，and suspected all women of being in reality Madam Knudsen in disguise．

Our charcoal-burning in the end was no financial success．From time to time it would happen that one of our kilns caught fire，and there was our profit gone up in smoke．Knudsen himself was much concerned about our failure，and speculated hard upon it：at last he declared that nobody in the world could burn charcoal if they did not have a fair supply of snow at hand．

Knudsen also helped me to make a pond on the farm．The farm road in one place ran through a wide cup of grassy ground；there was a spring here，and I thought out the plan of building a dam below it and turning the place into a lake．You are always short of water in Africa，it would be a great gain to the cattle to be able to drink in the field，and save themselves the long journey down to the river．This idea of a dam occupied all the farm day and night，and was much discussed；in the end，when it was finished，it was to all of us a majestic achievement．It was two hundred feet long．Old Knudsen took a great interest in it，and taught Pooran Singh to fabricate a dam-scoop．We had trouble with the dam when it was built，because it would not hold water when，after a long dry period，the big rains began；it gave way in a number of places and was half washed away more than once．It was Knudsen who struck upon the scheme of strengthening the earthwork by driving the farm oxen and the squatters' stock across the dam whenever they came to the pond to drink．Every goat and sheep had to contribute to the great work and stamp the structure．He had some big bloody fights with the little herdboys down here，for Knudsen insisted that the cattle should walk over slowly，but the wild young Totos wanted them galloping across，tails in the air．In the end，when I had sided with Knudsen and he had got the better of the Totos，the long file of cattle，sedately marching along the narrow bank looked against the sky like Noah's procession of animals going into the ark；and Old Knudsen himself，counting them，his stick under his arm，looked like the boatbuilder Noah，content in the thought that everybody but himself was soon to drown．

In the course of time，I got a vast expanse of water here，seven feet deep in places；the road went through the pond，it was very pretty．Later on we even built two more dams lower down and in this way obtained a row of ponds，like pearls upon a string．The pond now became the heart of the farm．It was always much alive，with a ring of cattle and children round it，and in the hot season，when water-holes dried up in the plains and the hills，the birds came to the farm：herons，ibis，kingfishers，quail，and a dozen varieties of geese and duck．In the evening，when the first stars sprang out in the sky，I used to go and sit by the pond，and then the birds came home．Swimming birds have a purposeful flight，unlike that of other birds：they are on a journey，going from one place to another—and what perspective is there not in the reading wild swimmers！The duck concluded their orbit over the glass-clear sky，to swoop noiselessly into the dark water like so many arrow-heads let off backwards by a heavenly archer．I once shot a crocodile in the pond；it was a strange thing，for he must have wandered twelve miles from the Athi river to get there．How did he know that there would be water now，where it had never been before？

When the first pond was finished，Knudsen communicated to me the plan of putting fish into it．We had in Africa a kind of perch，which was good to eat，and we dwelt much upon the idea of rich fishing on the farm．It was not，however，an easy thing to get them：the Game Department had set out perch in ponds but would let nobody fish there yet．But Knudsen confided to me his knowledge of a pond of which no one else in the world knew，where we could get as many fish as we wanted．We would drive there，he explained，draw a net through the pond，and take the fish back in the car in tins and vats in which they would keep alive on the way if we remembered to put water-weeds in with the water．He was so keen on his scheme that he trembled while developing it to me；with his own hands he made one of his inimitable fishing-nets for it．But as the time for the expedition drew near it took on a more and more mysterious aspect．It should be undertaken，he held，on a full moon night，about midnight．At first we had meant to take three boys with us，then he reduced the number to two and to one，and kept asking whether he was absolutely trustworthy．In the end he declared that it would be better that he and I should go by ourselves．I thought this a bad plan for we would not be able to carry the tins into the car，but Knudsen insisted that it would be by far the best，and added that we ought to tell no one of it．

I had friends in the Game Department，and I could not help it，I had to ask him：“Knudsen，to whom do these fish that we are going to catch，really belong？”Not a word answered Knudsen．He spat，a regular old sailor's spit—stretched out his foot in the old patched shoe and rubbed out the spitting on the ground，turned on his heel and walked off deadly slowly．He drew his head down between his shoulders as he went；now he could no longer see at all，but was fumbling before him with his stick；he was once more a beaten man，a homeless fugitive in a low，cold world．And as if in his gesture he had pronounced a spell I stood upon the spot where he had left me，victorious，in Madam Knudsen's slippers．

The fishing project was never again approached between Knudsen and me．Only some time after his death did I，with the assistance of the Game Department，set perch into the pond．They thrived there，and added their silent，cool，mute，restive life to the other life of the pond．In the middle of the day one could，on passing the pond，see them standing near the surface，like fish made out of dark glass in the dim sunny water．My Toto Tumbo was sent to the pond with a primitive fishing rod and drew up a perch of two pounds whenever an unexpected guest arrived at the house．

When I had found old Knudsen dead on the farm road，I sent in a runner to the police of Nairobi and reported his death．I had meant to bury him on the farm，but late at night two police officers came out in a car to fetch him，and brought a coffin with them．In the meantime a thunderstorm had broken out，and we had had three inches of rain，for this was just at the beginning of the long rainy season．We drove down to his house through torrents and sheets of water；as we carried Knudsen out to the car the thunder rolled over our heads like cannons，and the flashes of lightning stood on all sides thick as ears in a cornfield．The car had no chains to it and could hardly keep on the road，it swung from one side of it to another．Old Knudsen would have liked it；he would have been satisfied with his exit from the farm．

Afterwards I had a disagreement with the Nairobi Municipality over his funeral arrangements；it developed into a heated argument and I had to go into town about it more than once．It was a legacy left to me by Knudsen：a last tilt，by proxy，at the face of the law．Thus I was no longer Madam Knudsen，but a brother．





A Fugitive Rests on the Farm


There was one traveller who came to the farm，slept there for one night，and walked off not to come back，of whom I have since thought from time to time．His name was Emmanuelson；he was a Swede and when I first knew him he held the position of maître d'hotel at one of the hotels of Nairobi．He was a fattish young man with a red puffed face，and he was in the habit of standing by my chair when I was lunching at the hotel，to entertain me in a very oily voice of the old country，and of mutual acquaintances there；he was so persistently conversational that after a while I changed over to the only other hotel which in those days we had in the town．I then only vaguely heard of Emmanuelson；he seemed to have a gift for bringing himself into trouble，and also to differ，in his tastes and ideas of the pleasures of life，from the customary．So he had become unpopular with the other Scandinavians of the country．Upon one afternoon he suddenly appeared at the farm，much upset and frightened，and asked me for a loan so as to get off to Tanganyika at once，as otherwise he believed he would be sent to jail．Either my help came too late or Emmanuelson spent it on other things，for a short time after I heard that he had been arrested in Nairobi，he did not go to prison but for some time he disappeared from my horizon．

One evening I came riding home so late that the stars were already out，and caught sight of a man waiting outside my house on the stones．It was Emmanuelson，and he announced himself to me in a cordial voice：“Here comes a vagabond，Baroness．”I asked him how it was that I should find him there，and he told me that he had lost his way and so been landed at my house．His way to where？To Tanganyika．

That could hardly be true—the Tanganyika road was the great highway and easy to find，my own farm road took off from it．How was he going to get to Tanganyika？I asked him．He was going to walk，he informed me．That，I answered，was not a possible thing to do for anyone，it would mean three days through the Masai Reserve without water，and the lions were bad there just now，the Masai had been in the same day to complain about them and had asked me to come out and shoot one for them．

Yes，yes，Emmanuelson knew of all that，but he was going to walk to Tanganyika all the same．For he did not know what else to do．He was wondering now whether，having lost his way，he could bear me company for dinner and sleep at the farm to start early in the morning．If that was not convenient to me he would set out straight away while the stars were out so bright．

I had remained sitting on my horse while I talked to him，to accentuate that he was not a guest in the house，for I did not want him in to dine with me．But as he spoke，I saw that he did not expect to be invited either．He had no faith in my hospitality or in his own power of persuasion，and he made a lonely figure in the dark outside my house，a man without a friend．His hearty manner was adapted to save not his own face，which was past it，but mine；if now I sent him away it would be no unkindness，but quite all right．This was courtesy in a hunted animal—I called for mysice to take the pony，and got off—“Come in，Emmanuelson，”I said，“you can dine here and stay over the night．”

In the light of the lamp Emmanuelson was a sad sight．He had on a long black overcoat such as nobody wears in Africa，he was unshaven and his hair was not cut，his old shoes were split at the toe．He was bringing no belongings with him to Tanganyika，his hands were empty．It seemed that I was to take the part of the high priest who presents the goat alive to the Lord，and sends it into the wilderness．I thought that here we needed wine．Berkeley Cole，who generally kept the house in wine，some time ago had sent me a case of a very rare burgundy，and I now told Juma to open a bottle from it．When we sat down for dinner and Emmanuelson's glass was filled he drank half of it，held it towards the lamp，and looked at it for a long time like a person attentively listening to music．“Fameux，”he said，“fameux；this is a Chambertin 1906．”It was，and that gave me respect for Emmanuelson．

Otherwise he did not say much to begin with，and I did not know what to say to him．I asked him how it was that he had not been able to find any work at all．He answered that it was because he knew nothing of the things with which people out here occupied themselves．He had been dismissed at the hotel；besides he was not really a maître d'hôt el by profession．

“Do you know anything of book-keeping？”I asked him．

“No．Nothing at all，”he said．“I have always found it very difficult to add two figures together．”

“Do you know about cattle at all？”I went on．“Cows？”he asked．“No，no．I am afraid of cows．”

“Can you drive a tractor，then？”I asked．Here a faint ray of hope appeared on his face．“No，”he said．“But I think that I could learn that．”

“Not on my tractor though，”I said，“but tell me，Emmanuelson，what have you ever been doing？What are you in life？”

Emmanuelson drew himself up straight．“What am I？”he exclaimed．“Why，I am an actor．”

I thought：Thank God，it is altogether outside my capacity to assist this lost man in any practical way；the time has come for general human conversation．“You are an actor？”I said．“That is a fine thing to be．And which were your favourite parts when you were on the stage？”

“Oh I am a tragic actor，”said Emmanuelson．“My favourite parts were that of Armand in La Dame aux Camélias and of Oswald in Ghosts．”

We talked for some time of these plays，of the various actors whom we had seen in them and of the way in which we thought that they should be acted．Emmanuelson looked round the room．“You have not，”he asked，“by any chance got the plays of Henrik Ibsen here？Then we might do the last scene ofGhosts together，if you would not mind taking the part of Mrs．Alving．”

I had not got Ibsen's plays．

“But perhaps you will remember it？”said Emmanuelson warming to his plan．“I myself know Oswald by heart from beginning to end．That last scene is the best．For a real tragic effect，you know，that is impossible to beat．”

The stars were out and it was a very fine warm night；there was not long，now，to the big rains．I asked Emmanuelson if he did really mean to walk to Tanganyika．

“Yes，”he said，“I am going，now，to be my own prompter．”

“It is a good thing for you，”I said，“that you are not married．”

“Yes，”said he，“yes．”After a little while he added modestly：“I am married though．”

In the course of our talk，Emmanuelson complained of the fact that out here a white man could not hold his own against the competition from the Natives，who worked so much cheaper．“Now in Paris，”he said，“I could always，for a short time，get a job as a waiter in some cafe or other．”

“Why did you not stay in Paris，Emmanuelson？”I asked him．

He gave me a swift clear glance．“Paris？”he said，“no，no，indeed．I got out of Paris just at the nick of time．”

Emmanuelson had one friend in the world to whom in the course of the evening he came back many times．If he could only get in touch with him again，everything would be different，for he was prosperous and very generous．This man was a conjurer and was travelling all over the world．When Emmanuelson had last heard of him he had been in San Francisco．

From time to time we talked of literature and the theatre and then again we would come back to Emmanuelson's future．He told me how his countrymen out here in Africa had one after another turned him out．

“You are in a hard position，Emmanuelson，”I said，“I do not know that I can think of anyone who is，in a way，harder up against things than you are．”

“No，I think so myself，”he said．“But then there is one thing of which I have thought lately and of which perhaps you have not thought：some person or other will have to be in the worst position of all people．”

He had finished his bottle and pushed his glass a little away from him．“This journey，”he said，“is a sort of gamble to me，le rouge et le noir．I have a chance to get out of things，I may even be getting out of everything．On the other hand if I get to Tanganyika I may get into things．”

“I think you will get to Tanganyika，”I said，“you may get a lift from one of the Indian lorries travelling on that road．”

“Yes，but there are the lions，”said Emmanuelson，“and the Masai．”

“Do you believe in God，Emmanuelson？”I asked him．

“Yes，yes，yes，”said Emmanuelson．He sat in silence for a time．“Perhaps you will think me a terrible sceptic，”he said，“if I now say what I am going to say．But with the exception of God I believe in absolutely nothing whatever．”

“Look here，Emmanuelson，”I said，“have you got any money？”

“Yes，I have，”he said，“eighty cents．”

“That is not enough，”I said，“and I myself have got no money in the house．But perhaps Farah will have some．”Farah had got four rupees．

Next morning，some time before sunrise，I told my boys to wake up Emmanuelson and to make breakfast for us．I had thought，in the courseof the night，that I should like to take him in my car for the first ten miles of his way．It was no advantage to Emmanuelson，who would still have another eighty miles to walk，but I did not like to see him step straight from the threshold of my house into his uncertain fate，and besides I wished to be，myself，somewhere within this comedy or tragedy of his．I made him up a parcel of sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs，and gave him with it a bottle of the Chambertin 1906 since he appreciated it．I thought that it might well be his last drink in life．

Emmanuelson in the dawn looked like one of those legendary corpses whose beards grow quickly in the earth，but he came forth from his grave with a good grace and was very placid and well-balanced as we drove on．When we had come to the other side of the Mbagathi river，I let him down from the car．The morning air was clear and there was not a cloud in the sky．He was going towards the south-west．As I looked round to the opposite horizon，the sun just came up，dull and red：like the yolk of a hard-boiled egg，I thought．In three or four hours she would be white-hot，and fierce upon the head of the wanderer．

Emmanuelson said good-bye to me；he started to walk，and then came back and said good-bye once more．I sat in the car and watched him，and I think that as he went he was pleased to have a spectator．I believe that the dramatic instinct within him was so strong that he was at this moment vividly aware of being leaving the stage，of disappearing，as if he had，with the eyes of his audience，seen himself go．Exit Emmanuelson．Should not the hills，the thorn trees and the dusty road take pity and for a second put on the aspect of cardboard？

In the morning breeze his long black overcoat fluttered round his legs，the neck of the bottle stuck up from one of its pockets．I felt my heart filling with the love and gratitude which the people who stay at home are feeling for the wayfarers and wanderers of the world，the sailors，explorers，and vagabonds．As he came to the top of the hill he turned，took off his hat and waved it to me；his long hair was blown up from his forehead．

Farah，who was with me in the car，asked me：“Where is that Bwana going？”Farah called Emmanuelson a Bwana for the sake of his own dignity，since he had slept in the house．

“To Tanganyika，”I said．

“On foot？”asked he．

“Yes，”I said．

“Allah be with him，”said Farah．

In the course of the day I thought much of Emmanuelson，and went out of the house to look towards the Tanganyika road．In the night，about ten o'clock，I heard the roar of a lion far away to the south-west；half an hour later I heard him again．I wondered if he was sitting upon an old black overcoat．During the following week I tried to get news of Emmanuelson，and told Farah to ask his Indian acquaintances who were running lorries to Tanganyika whether any lorry had passed or met him on the road．But nobody knew anything of him．

Half a year later I was surprised to receive a registered letter from Dodoma，where I knew no one．The letter was from Emmanuelson．It contained the fifty rupees that I had first lent him when he had been trying to get out of the country，and Farah's four rupees．Apart from this sum—the last money in all the world that I had expected to see again—Emmanuelson sent me a long，sensible and charming letter．He had got a job as a bartender in Dodoma，whatever kind of bar they may have there，and was getting on well．He seemed to have in him a talent for gratitude；he remembered everything of his evening on the farm，and came back many times to the fact that there he had felt amongst friends．He told me in detail about his journey to Tanganyika．He had much good to say of the Masai．They had found him on the road and had taken him in，had shown him great kindness and hospitality，and had let him travel with them most of the way，by many circuits．He had，he wrote，entertained them so well，with recounts of his adventures in many countries，that they had not wanted to let him go．Emmanuelson did not know any Masai language，and for his Odyssey he must have fallen back upon pantomime．

It was fit and becoming，I thought，that Emmanuelson should have sought refuge with the Masai，and that they should have received him．The true aristocracy and the true proletariat of the world are both in understanding with tragedy．To them it is the fundamental principle of God，and the key—the minor key—to existence．They differ in this way from the bourgeoisie of all classes，who deny tragedy，who will not tolerate it，and to whom the word of tragedy means in itself unpleasantness．Many misunderstandings between the white middle-class immigrant settlers and the Natives arise from this fact．The sulky Masai are both aristocracy and proletariat，they would have recognized at once in the lonely wanderer in black，a figure of tragedy；and the tragic actor had come，with them，into his own．





Visits of Friends


The visits of my friends to the farm were happy events in my life，and the farm knew it．

When one of Denys Finch-Hatton's long safaris was drawing to its end，it happened that I would find，on a morning，a young Masai standing upon one long slim leg outside my house．“Bedâr is on his way back，”he announced．“He will be here in two or three days．”

In the afternoon，a squatter Toto from the outskirts of the farm sat and waited on the lawn，to tell me，when I came out：“There is a flight of guinea-fowl down by the bend of the river．If you want to shoot them for Bedâr when he comes I will come out with you at sunset to show you where to find them．”

To the great wanderers amongst my friends，the farm owed its charm，I believe，to the fact that it was stationary and remained the same whenever they came to it．They had been over vast countries and had raised and broken their tents in many places，now they were pleased to round my drive that was steadfast as the orbit of a star．They liked to be met by familiar faces，and I had the same servants all the time that I was in Africa．I had been on the farm longing to get away，and they came back to it longing for books and linen sheets and the cool atmosphere in a big shuttered room；by their campfires they had been meditating upon the joys of farm life，and as they arrived they asked me eagerly：“Have you taught your cook to make an omelette a la chasseur？—and have the gramophone records from Petrouchka arrived by the last mail？”They came and stayed in the house also when I was away，and Denys had the use of it，when I was on a visit in Europe．“My silvan retreat，”Berkeley Cole called it．

In return for the goods of civilization，the wayfarers brought me trophies from their hunts：leopard and cheetah skins，to be made into fur coats in Paris，snake and lizard skins for shoes，and marabout feathers．

To please them I experimented，while they were away，with many curious recipes out of old cookery books，and worked to make European flowers grow in my garden．

Once，when I was at home，an old lady in Denmark gave me twelve fine peony-bulbs which I brought into the country with me at some trouble，as the import regulations about plants were strict．When I had them planted，they sent up，almost immediately，a great number of dark carmoisin curvilinear shoots，and later a lot of delicate leaves and rounded buds．The first flower which unfolded was called Duchesse de Nemours：it was a large single white peony，very noble and rich，it gave out a profusion of fresh sweet scent．When I cut it and put it in water in my sitting-room，every single white person entering the room stopped and remarked upon it．Why，it was a peony！But soon after this，all the other buds of my plants withered and fell off，and I never got more than that one flower．

Some years later I talked with the English gardener of Lady McMillan，of Chiromo，about peonies．“We have not succeeded in growing peonies in Africa，”he said，“and shall not do so till we manage to make an imported bulb flower here，and can take the seed from that flower．This is how we got delphinium into the colony．”In that way I might have introduced peonies into the country and made my name immortal like the Duchesse de Nemours herself；and I had ruined the glory of the future by picking my unique flower and putting it in water．I have very often dreamed that I have seen the white peony growing，and I have rejoiced because after all I had not cut it off．




Friends from farms up country，and from the town，arrived at the house．Hugh Martin，of the Land Office，came out from Nairobi to entertain me；a brilliant person，versed in the rare literature of the world，who had passed his life peacefully in the civil service of the East，and there，amongst other things，had developed an innate talent for looking like an immensely fat Chinese idol．He called me Candide，and was himself a curious Doctor Pangloss of the farm，firmly and placidly rooted in his conviction of the meanness and contemptibleness of human nature and of the universe，and content in his faith，for why should it not be so？He hardly ever moved out of the large chair in which he had once placed himself．With his bottle and glass before him，and a sedately beaming face，he there spread and expanded upon his theories of life，luminating with ideas，like some fantastical quick phosphoric growth of matter and thought，a fat man at peace with the world and resting in the Devil，with the stamp of cleanliness upon him that the Devil's disciples bear，in preference to many of those of the Lord．

Young，big-nosed Gustav Mohr from Norway，of an evening suddenly swooped on the house from the farm he managed，on the other side of Nairobi．He was a rousing farmer and helped me in the work of the farm in word and deed，more than any other man in the country—with a simple vigorous readiness as if it were standing to reason that farmers，or Scandinavians，were to slave for one another．

Here he was now flung on to the farm by his own burning mind，like a stone out of a volcano．He was going mad，he said，in a country which expected a man to keep alive on talk of oxen and sisal；his soul was starving and he could stand it no longer．He began the moment he came into the room and went on till after midnight，holding forth on love，communism，prostitution，Hamsun，the Bible，and poisoning himself in very bad tobacco all the time．He would hardly eat，he would not listen，if I tried to get a word in he shrieked，glowing with the fire within him，and butting the air with his wild light head．He had much in him to rid himself of，and was generating more as he spoke．Suddenly，at two o'clock at night，he had no more to say．He would then sit peacefully for a little while，a humble look on his face，like a convalescent in a hospital garden，get up，and drive away at a terrible speed，prepared to keep alive，once more，for a while，on sisal and oxen．

Ingrid Lindstrom came to stay on the farm when she could get away for a day or two from her own farm，her turkeys，and market gardening at Njoro．Ingrid was as fair of skin as of mind，and the daughter and wife of Swedish officers．She and her husband had come out with their children to Africa on a joyous adventure，a picnic，to make a fortune quickly，and had bought up flax-land because at that time flax was £500 a ton，and when，just after that，flax fell to £40 and flax-land and flax-machinery were worth nothing，she put in all her strength to save the farm for her family，planning her poultry farm and her market garden，and working like a slave．In the course of that strife she fell deeply in love with the farm，with her cows and pigs，Natives and vegetables，with the very soil of her bit of Africa，in such a great desperate passion that she would have sold both husband and children to keep it．She and I，during the bad years，had wept in one another's arms at the thought of losing our land．It was a joyful time when Ingrid came to stay with me，for she had all the broad bold insinuating joviality of an old Swedish peasant woman，and in her weather-beaten face，the strong white teeth of a laughing Valkyrie．Therefore does the world love the Swedes，because in the midst of their woes they can draw it all to their bosom and be so gallant that they shine a long way away．

Ingrid had an old Kikuyu cook and houseboy named Kemosa，who filled a number of offices with her，and looked upon all her activities as his own．He slaved for her in the market garden and poultry yard，and also acted as a duenna to her three small daughters，travelling with them to and from their boarding school．When I came up to visit her on her farm at Njoro，Ingrid told me，Kemosa lost all his balance of mind，let go his hold of everything else，and made the grandest possible preparations for my reception，killing off her turkeys，so much was he impressed with Farah's greatness．Ingrid said he looked upon his acquaintance with Farah as upon the greatest honour of his existence．

Mrs．Darrell Thompson of Njoro，whom I hardly knew，came out to see me when the doctors had informed her that she had only got a few more months to live．She told me that she had just been buying a pony in Ireland，a prize-jumper—for horses were to her，in death as in life，the height and glory of existence—and that now，after she had talked with the doctors，she had at first meant to cable home to stop him from coming out，but then she had made up her mind to leave him to me when she herself should die．I did not think much about it until，after her death half a year later，the pony，Poor-box，made his appearance at Ngong．Poor-box，when he came to live with us，proved himself the most intelligent being on the farm．He was not much to look at，stumpy and long past his youth，Denys Finch-Hatton used to ride him，but I never cared much to do so．But by pure politics and circumspection，by knowing exactly what he wanted to do，amongst the young shining fiery horses brought out for the occasion by our wealthiest people of the colony，he won the jumping competition of Kabete，which was held in honour of the Prince of Wales．With his usual collected unassuming mien and countenance he brought home a big silver medal and，after a week of extreme anxiety，raised great radiant waves of rapture and triumph in my household and on all the farm．He died from horse-sickness，six months later，and was buried outside his stable under the lemon trees，and much lamented；his name lived a long time after him．

Old Mr．Bulpett，whom the Club called Uncle Charles，used to come out to dine with me．He was a great friend of mine，and a kind of ideal to me，the English gentleman of the Victorian age，and quite at home in our own．He had swum the Hellespont，and had been one of the first to climb the Matterhorn，and he had been，in his early youth，in the eighties perhaps，La Belle Otéro's lover．I was told that she had ruined him altogether and let him go．It was to me as if I were sitting down to dinner with Armand Duval or the Chevalier des Grieux themselves．He had many lovely pictures of Otéro，and liked to talk about her．

Once，at dinner at Ngong，I said to him：“I see that La Belle Otéro's memoirs have been published．Are you in them？”

“Yes，”he said，“I am in them．Under another name，but still there．”

“What does she write about you？”I asked．

“She writes，”he said，“that I was a young man who went through a hundred thousand for her sake within six months，but that I had full value for my money．”

“And do you consider，”I said and laughed，“that you did have full value？”

He thought my question over for a very short moment．“Yes，”he said．“Yes，I had．”

Denys Finch-Hatton and I went with Mr．Bulpett for a picnic to the top of the Ngong Hills on his seventy-seventh birthday．As we sat up there we came to discuss the question of whether，if we were offered a pair of real wings，which could never be laid off，we would accept or decline the offer．

Old Mr．Bulpett sat and looked out over the tremendous big country below us，the green land of Ngong，and the Rift Valley to the west，as if ready to fly off over it at any moment．“I would accept，”he said，“I would certainly accept．There is nothing I should like better．”After a little time of thought he added：“I suppose that I should think it over，though，if I were a lady．”





The Noble Pioneer


As far as Berkeley Cole and Denys Finch-Hatton were concerned，my house was a communist establishment．Everything in it was theirs，and they took a pride in it，and brought home the things they felt to be lacking．They kept the house up to a high standard in wine and tobacco，and got books and gramophone records out from Europe for me．Berkeley arrived with his car loaded up with turkeys，eggs，and oranges，from his own farm on Mount Kenya．They both had the ambition to make me a judge of wine，as they were，and spent much time and thought in the task．They took the greatest pleasure in my Danish table glass and china，and used to build up on the dinner table a tall shining pyramid of all my glass，the one piece on the top of the other；they enjoyed the sight of it．

Berkeley，when he stayed on the farm，had a bottle of champagne out in the forest every morning at eleven o'clock．Once，as he was taking leave of me，and thanking me for his time on the farm，he added that there had been one shadow in the picture，for we had been given coarse and vulgar glasses for our wine under the trees．“I know，Berkeley，”I said，“but I have so few of my good glasses left，and the boys will break them when they have to carry them such a long way．”He looked at me gravely，my hand in his．“But my dear，”he said，“it has been so sad．”So afterwards he had my best glasses brought out in the wood．

It was a curious thing about Berkeley and Denys—who were so deeply regretted by their friends in England when they emigrated，and so much beloved and admired in the colony—that they should be all the same，outcasts．It was not a society that had thrown them out，and not any place in the whole world either，but time had done it，they did not belong to their century．No other nation than the English could have produced them，but they were examples of atavism，and theirs was an earlier England，a world which no longer existed．In the present epoch they had no home，but had got to wander here and there，and in the course of time they also came to the farm．Of this they were not themselves aware．They had，on the contrary，a feeling of guilt towards their existence in England which they had left，as if，just because they were bored with it，they had been running away from a duty with which their friends had put up．Denys，when he came to talk of his young days—although he was so young still—and of his prospects，and the advice that his friends in England sent him，quoted Shakespeare's Jacques：

If it do come to pass

That any man turn ass，

Leaving his wealth and ease，

A stubborn will to please…



But he was wrong in his view of himself，so was Berkeley，and so perhaps was Jaques．They believed that they were deserters，who sometimes had to pay for their wilfulness，but they were in reality exiles，who bore their exile with a good grace．

Berkeley，if he had had his small head enriched with a wig of long silky curls，could have walked in and out of the court of King Charles II．He might have sat，a nimble youth from England，at the feet of the aged d'Artagnan，the d'Artagnan of Vingt ans après，have listened to his wisdom，and kept the sayings in his heart．I felt that the law of gravitation did not apply to Berkeley，but that he might，as we sat talking at night by the fire，at any moment go straight up through the chimney．He was a very good judge of men，with no illusions about them and no spite．Out of a kind of devilry，he was most charming to the people of whom he had the poorest opinion．When he really chalked his soles for the job he was an inimitable buffoon．But to be a wit in the manner of Congreve and Wycherley en plein vingtième siècle takes a few more qualities than Congreve or Wycherley themselves had got in them：a glow，grandezza，the wild hope．Where the jest was carried far in its daring and arrogance，sometimes it became pathetic．When Berkeley，a little heated，and as if translucent with wine，really got on his high horse，on the wall behind him the shadow of it began to grow and move，falling into a haughty and fantastical canter，as if it came of a noble breed and its sire's name had been Rosinante．But Berkeley himself，the invincible jester，lonely in his African life，half an invalid—for his heart always gave him trouble—with his beloved farm on Mount Kenya every day more in the hands of the banks，would have been the last to recognize or fear the shadow．

Small，very slight，red-haired，with narrow hands and feet，Berkeley carried himself extremely erect，with a little Artagnanesque turn of the head to right and left，the gentle motion of the unbeaten duellist．He walked as noiselessly as a cat．And，like a cat，he made every room that he sat in，a place of comfort，as if he had had in him a source of heat and fun．If Berkeley had come and sat with you upon the smoking ruin of your house，he would，like a cat，have made you feel that you were in a picked snug corner．When he was at his ease you expected to hear him purr，like a big cat，and when he was sick，it was more than sad and distressing，it was formidable as is the sickness of a cat．He had no principles，but a surprising stock of prejudices，as you would expect it in a cat．

If Berkeley were a cavalier of the Stuarts' day，Denys should be set in an earlier English landscape，in the days of Queen Elizabeth．He could have walked arm in arm，there，with Sir Philip，or Francis Drake．And the people of Elizabeth's time might have held him dear because to them he would have suggested that antiquity，the Athens，of which they dreamed and wrote．Denys could indeed have been placed harmoniously in any period of our civilization，tout comme chez soi，all up till the opening of the nineteenth century．He would have cut a figure in any age，for he was an athlete，a musician，a lover of art，and a fine sportsman．He did cut a figure in his own age，but it did not quite fit in anywhere．His friends in England always wanted him to come back，they wrote out plans and schemes for a career for him there，but Africa was keeping him．

The particular，instinctive attachment which all Natives of Africa felt towards Berkeley and Denys，and towards a few other people of their kind，made me reflect that perhaps the white men of the past，indeed of any past，would have been in better understanding and sympathy with the coloured races than we，of our industrial age，shall ever be．When the first steam engine was constructed，the roads of the races of the world parted，and we have never found one another since．

There was a shadow cast over my friendship with Berkeley by the circumstance that Jama，his young Somali servant，was of a tribe at war with Farah's tribe．To people familiar with the clannish feelings of the Somali，those dark deep desert glances that were exchanged over our dinner table，when the two were waiting on Berkeley and me，bode as ill as possible．Late in the evening we fell to talking of what we were to do when we should be coming out in the morning to find both Farah and Jama cold，with daggers in their hearts．In these matters the enemies knew neither fear nor sense，they were held back from bloodshed and ruin solely by their feelings of attachment，such as they were，for Berkeley and me．

“I dare not，”said Berkeley，“tell Jama tonight that I have changed my mind，and that I shall not this time be going to Eldoret，where lives the young woman that he is in love with．For then his heart will turn to stone against me，it will be a matter of no importance to him if my clothes are brushed，and he will go out and kill Farah．”

Jama's heart，however，never did turn to stone towards Berkeley．He had been with him a long time，and Berkeley often talked about him．He told me how once，over a matter in which Jama held himself to be right，Berkeley had lost his temper and had hit the Somali．“But then，my dear，you know，”said Berkeley，“at the very same moment I had one straight back in my face．”

“And how did it go then？”I asked him．

“Oh it went all right，”Berkeley said，modestly．After a little while he added：“It was not so bad．He is twenty years younger than me．”

This incident had left no trace in the attitude of either the master or the servant，Jama had a quiet，slightly patronizing manner towards Berkeley，such as most Somali servants have got towards their employers．After Berkeley's death，Jama did not want to stay in the country，but went back to Somaliland．

Berkeley had a great，ever unsatisfied，love of the sea．It was a favourite dream of his that he and I should—when we had made money—buy a dhow and go trading to Lamu，Mombasa and Zanzibar．We had our plans all worked out and our crew ready，but we never did make money．

Whenever Berkeley was tired or unwell he fell back on his thoughts of the sea．He then grieved over his own foolishness in having spent a lifetime anywhere but on salt water，and used strong language about it．Once when I was going to Europe and he was in this mood，to please him I conceived the plan of bringing out two ship's lanterns，starboard and port，to hang by the entrance door of my house，and told him of it．

“Yes，it would be nice，”he said，“the house would be in that way like a ship．But they must have sailed．”

So in Copenhagen in a sailors' shop by one of the old canals，I bought a pair of big old heavy ship's lanterns，which had for many years sailed in the Baltic．We had them up on each side of the door，it faced east and we were pleased to think that the lamps were correctly placed；as the earth，on her course through the ether，throws herself forward，there would be no collision．These lamps gave Berkeley much content of heart．He often used to come to the house quite late，and ordinarily at a great speed，but when the lamps were lighted he drove slowly，slowly，up the drive，to let the little red and green stars in the night sink into his soul and bring back old pictures，reminiscences of shipfaring，to feel as if he were indeed approaching a silent ship on dark water．We developed a signalling system in regard to the lamps，changing their place or taking down the one，so that he should know，already while in the forest，in what mood he would find his hostess，and what sort of dinner was awaiting him．




Berkeley，like his brother Galbraith Cole and his brother-in-law Lord Delamere，was an early settler，a pioneer of the colony，and intimate with the Masai，who in those days were the domineering nation of the land．He had known them before the European civilization—which in the depths of their hearts they loathed more than anything else in the world—cut through their roots；before they were moved from their fair north country．He could speak with them of the old days in their own tongue．Whenever Berkeley was staying on the farm，the Masai came over the river to see him．The old chiefs sat and discussed their troubles of the present time with him，his jokes would make them laugh，and it was as if a hard stone had laughed．

Because of Berkeley's knowledge of，and friendship with，the Masai，a most imposing ceremony came to take place on the farm．

When the Great War first broke out，and the Masai had news of it，the blood of the old fighting tribe was all up．They had visions of splendid battles and massacres，and they saw the glory of the past returning once more．I happened to be out，during the first months of the war，alone with Natives and Somali，with three ox-wagons，doing transport for the English Government，and trekking through the Masai Reserve．Whenever the people of a new district heard of my arrival they came round to my camp，with shining eyes，to ask me a hundred questions of the war and the Germans—was it true that they were coming from the air？In their minds they were running breathless，to meet danger and death．At night the young warriors swarmed round my tent，in full warpaint，with spears and swords；sometimes，in order to show me what they were really like，they would give out a short roar，an imitation of the lion's roar．They did not doubt then that they would be allowed to fight．

But the English Government did not think it wise to organize the Masai to make war on white men，be they even Germans，and it forbade the Masai to fight，and put an end to all their hopes．The Kikuyu were to take part in the war as carriers，but the Masai were to keep their hands off their weapons．But in 1918，when conscription had been introduced in regard to all the other Natives of the colony，the government thought it necessary to call out the Masai as well．An officer of the K．A．R．，with his regiment，was sent to Narok to procure three hundred Morani as soldiers．By this time the Masai had lost their sympathy with the war and refused to come．The Morani of the district disappeared into the woods and the bush．In the pursuit of them the K．A．R．troops by mistake fired on a manyatta，and two old women were killed．Two days after，the Masai Reserve was in open revolt，swarms of Morani swept through the country，killed a number of Indian traders，and burned down more than fifty dukhas．The situation was serious，and the government did not want to force it．Lord Delamere was sent down to negotiate with the Masai and in the end a compromise was set up．The Masai were allowed to take out the three hundred Morani themselves，and they were let off with a joint fine in punishment of their devastation in the Reserve．No Morani appeared，but by that time the Armistice put an end to the whole matter．

During the time of all these events，some of the old big Masai chiefs had made themselves useful to the English military，by sending out their young men to scout on the movements of the Germans in the Reserve and on the border．Now that the war was over，the government wanted to show their recognition of their services．A number of medals were sent out from home to be distributed amongst the Masai，and as far as twelve of the medals were concerned Berkeley，who knew the Masai so well and could speak Masai，was asked to deal them out．

My farm bordered on the Masai Reserve and Berkeley came to ask me if he might stay with me and give out the medals from my house．He was a little nervous about the enterprise，and told me that he had no clear idea what was expected from him．On a Sunday we drove together a long way down into the Reserve，and talked with the people in the manyattas，in order to summon the chiefs in question to the farm on such and such a day．Berkeley in his very young days had been an officer in the 9th Lancers，and he was then，I have been told，the smartest young officer in his regiment．Still，as，towards sunset，we were driving home again，he began to speak to me of the military calling and mentality，and to develop his ideas upon them，in the manner of a civilian．

The distribution of the medals，although in itself of no special consequence，was an event of great dimensions and weight．So much wisdom，sagacity and tact were displayed in it，on both sides，as to make it stand for an act in the history of the world，or a symbol：

…His Darkness and his Brightness

exchanged a greeting of extreme politeness．



The old Masai had arrived，followed by retainers or sons of theirs．They sat and waited on the lawn，from time to time discussing my cows grazing there；perhaps they had a faint hope that，in reward of their services，they were to be made a present of a cow．Berkeley kept them waiting a long time，which was，I believe，to them in the order of things；in the meantime he had an armchair carried out on the lawn in front of the house，in which to sit while he gave out the medals．When in the end he came forth from the house he looked，in this dark company，very fair，red-haired and light-eyed．He had now the complete brisk cheerful carriage and expression of an efficient young officer，so that I learned that Berkeley，who could let his face express so many things，could also in the hour of need make it an absolute blank．He was followed by Jama，who had on a very fine Arabian waistcoat all embroidered in gold and silver，which Berkeley had let him buy for the occasion，and who carried the box with the medals．

Berkeley stood up in front of his chair to speak，and so active was the uprightness of his slight small figure that the old people got on to their legs，one by one，and stood facing him，their eyes in his，gravely．What the speech was about I cannot say，as it was in Masai．It sounded as if he were briefly informing the Masai that an unbelievable benefit was to be bestowed upon them，and that the explanation of the happenings was their own incredibly praiseworthy behaviour．But seeing that it was Berkeley who spoke，and that from the faces of the Masai you would never learn anything，it may have contained something quite different，of which I should never have thought．When he had spoken，without a moment's pause he let Jama bring up the box，and took out the medals，solemnly reading out，one after another，the names of the Masai chiefs，and handing them their medals with a generously outstretched arm．The Masai took them from him very silently，in an outstretched hand．The ceremony could only have been carried through so well by two parties of noble blood and great family traditions；may democracy take no offence．

A medal is an inconvenient thing to give to a naked man，because he has got no place to fix it on to，and the old Masai chiefs kept standing with theirs in their hand．After a time a very old man came up to me，held out his hand with the medal in it，and asked me to tell him what it had got on it．I explained it to him as well as I could．The silver coin had on the one side a head of Britannia，and upon the other side the words：“The Great War for Civilization．”

I have later told some English friends of the incident of the medals，and they have asked：“Why was not the king's head on the medals？It was a great mistake．”I myself do not think so，it seems to me that the medals should not be made too attractive，and that the whole matter was well arranged．It may still be that it is this sort of thing which we shall be given at the time when our reward is great in heaven．




When Berkeley was taken ill，I was about to go to Europe on a holiday．He was then a member of the Legislative Council of the colony，and I telegraphed to him：“Will you not come and stay at Ngong for the sitting of the counci bring bottles．”He wired back：“Your telegram straight from heaven arriving with bottles．”But when he came to the farm，his car all filled up with wine，he did not care to drink it．He was very pale，and even sometimes quite silent．His heart was bad，and he could not do without Jama，who had been taught to give him the injections for it，and he had many worries that lay on it heavily；he lived in great fear of losing his farm．Still，by his presence，he turned my house into a chosen，comfortable corner of the world．

“I have come to the stage，Tania，”he said to me gravely，“when I can only drive in the very best of cars，only smoke the finest cigars，and only drink the most exquisite vintages of wine．”While he was staying with me then，he told me one evening that the doctor had ordered him to go to bed and stay in bed for a month．I said to him that if he would follow the order，and stay in bed for a month at Ngong，I would give up my journey to remain there and look after him，and go to Europe next year．He thought my offer over for a little while．“My dear，”he said，“I could not do it．If I did it to please you，what should I be afterwards？”

I said good-bye to him then with a heavy heart．While I was sailing home，past Lamu and Takaunga，where our dhow was to have found her way，I thought of him．But in Paris I heard that he had died．He had dropped down dead before his house，as he was stepping out of the car．He was buried on his farm，where he wished to be．

When Berkeley died，the country changed．His friends felt it at the time，with great sadness，and many people came to feel it later．An epoch in the history of the colony came to an end with him．In the course of the years many things were reckoned from this turning point，and people said：“When Berkeley Cole lived”or“Since Berkeley died．”Up till his death the country had been the Happy Hunting Grounds，now it was slowly changing and turning into a business proposition．Some standards were lowered when he went：a standard of wit，as it was soon felt—and such a thing is sad in a colony；a standard of gallantry—soon after his death people began to talk of their troubles；a standard of humanity．

As Berkeley went away，a grim figure made her entrance upon the stage from the opposite wing—la dure nécessité maîtresse des hommes et des dieux．It was a strange thing that a small slight man should have been able to keep her from the door，for so long a time as he drew breath．The yeast was out of the bread of the land．A presence of gracefulness，gaiety and freedom，an electric power-factor was out．A cat had got up and left the room．





Wings


Denys Finch-Hatton had no other home in Africa than the farm．He lived in my house between his safaris，and kept his books and his gramophone there．When he came back to the farm，it gave out what was in it；it spoke—as the coffee plantations speak，when with the first showers of the rainy season they flower，dripping wet，a cloud of chalk．When I was expecting Denys back，and heard his car coming up the drive，I heard，at the same time，the things of the farm all telling what they really were．He was happy on the farm；he came there only when he wanted to come，and it knew，in him，a quality of which the world besides was not aware，a humility．He never did but what he wanted to do，neither was guile found in his mouth．

Denys had a trait of character which to me was very precious，he liked to hear a story told．For I have always thought that I might have cut a figure at the time of the plague of Florence．Fashions have changed，and the art of listening to a narrative has been lost in Europe．The Natives of Africa，who cannot read，have still got it；if you begin to them：“There was a man who walked out on the plain，and there he met another man，”you have them all with you，their minds running upon the unknown track of the men on the plain．But white people，even if they feel that they ought to，cannot listen to a recital．If they do not become fidgety，and remember things that should be done at once，they fall asleep．The same people will ask you for something to read，and may then sit all through an evening absorbed in any kind of print handed them，they will even then read a speech．They have been accustomed to take in their impressions by the eye．

Denys，who lived much by the ear，preferred hearing a tale told to reading it；when he came to the farm he would ask：“Have you got a story？”I had been making up many while he had been away．In the evenings he made himself comfortable，spreading cushions like a couch in front of the fire，and with me sitting on the floor，cross-legged like Scheherazade herself，he would listen，clear-eyed，to a long tale，from when it began until it ended．He kept better account of it than I did myself，and at the dramatic appearance of one of the characters，would stop me to say：“That man died in the beginning of the story，but never mind．”

Denys taught me Latin，and to read the Bible，and the Greek poets．He himself knew great parts of the Old Testament by heart，and carried the Bible with him on all his journeys，which gained him the high esteem of the Mohammedans．

He also gave me my gramophone．It was a delight to my heart，it brought a new life to the farm，it became the voice of the farm—“The soul within a glade the nightingale is．”—Sometimes Denys would arrive unexpectedly at the house，while I was out in the coffee field or the maize field，bringing new records with him；he would set the gramophone going，and as I came riding back at sunset，the melody streaming towards me in the clear cool air of the evening would announce his presence to me，as if he had been laughing at me，as he often did．The Natives liked thegramophone，and used to stand round the house to listen to it；some of my houseboy picked out a favourite tune and asked me for it，when I was alone with them in the house．It was a curious thing that Kamante should stick，in his preference，with much devotion to the Adagio of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C Major；the first time that he asked me for it he had some difficulty in describing it，so as to make clear to me which tune it was that he wanted．

Denys and I，however，did not agree in our tastes．For I wanted the old composers，and Denys，as if courteously making up to the age for his lack of harmony with it，was as modern as possible in his taste of all arts．He liked to hear the most advanced music．“I would like Beethoven all right，”he said，“if he were not vulgar．”

Denys and I，whenever we were together，had great luck with lions．Sometimes he came back from a shooting safari of two or three months，vexed that he had been unable to get a good lion for the people from Europe whom he had taken out．In the meantime the Masai had been to my house and had asked me to come out and shoot a certain lion or lioness which was killing off their cattle，and Farah and I had been out，camping in their manyatta，sitting up over a kill，or walking out in the early morning，without as much as finding the track of a lion．But when Denys and I went for a ride，the lions of the plains would be about，as in attendance，we would come upon them then there at a meal，or see them crossing the dry river-beds．




On a New Year's morning，before sunrise，Denys and I found ourselves on the new Narok road，driving along as fast as we could go on a rough road．

Denys，the day before，had lent a heavy rifle to a friend of his who was going south with a shooting party，and late in the night he remembered that he had neglected to explain to him a certain trick in the rifle，by which the hair-trigger might be put out of action．He was worried about it and afraid that the hunter would come to some sort of harm by his ignorance．We could then think of no better remedy than that we should start as early as possible，take the new road and try to overtake the shooting party at Narok．It was sixty miles，through some rough country；the safari was travelling by the old road and would be going slowly as it had heavy loaded lorries with it．Our only trouble was that we did not know if the new road would have been brought through all the way to Narok．

The early morning air of the African highlands is of such a tangible coldness and freshness that time after time the same fancy there comes back to you：you are not on earth but in dark deep waters，going ahead along the bottom of the sea．It is not even certain that you are moving at all：the flows of chilliness against your face may be the deep-sea currents，and your car，like some sluggish electric fish，may be sitting steadily upon the bottom of the sea，staring in front of her with the glaring eyes of her lamps，and letting the submarine life pass by her．The stars are so large because they are no real stars but reflections，shimmering upon the surface of the water．Alongside your path on the sea-bottom，live things，darker than their surroundings，keep on appearing，jumping up and sweeping into the long grass，as crabs and beach-fleas will make their way into the sand．The light gets clearer，and，about sunrise，the sea bottom lifts itself towards the surface，a new created island．Whirls of smells drift quickly past you，fresh rank smells of the olive-bushes，the brine scent of burnt grass，a sudden quelling smell of decay．

Kanuthia，Denys's boy，who sat in the back of the box-body car，gently touched my shoulder and pointed to the right．To the side of the road，twelve or fifteen yards away from it，was a dark bulk，a manatee taking a rest on the sands，and on the top of it something was stirring in the dark water．It was，I saw later，a big dead giraffe bull，that had been shot two or three days before．You are not allowed to shoot the giraffe，and Denys and I later had to defend ourselves against the charge of having killed this one，but we could prove that it had been dead some time when we came upon it，though it was never found by whom or why it had been killed．Upon the huge carcass of the giraffe a lioness had been feeding，and now raised her head and shoulder above it to watch the passing car．

Denys stopped the car，and Kanuthia lifted the rifle that he carried，off his shoulder．Denys asked me in a low voice：“Shall I shoot her？”—for he very courteously looked on the Ngong Hill as my private hunting-ground．We were going across the land of the same Masai who had been to my house to bewail the loss of their cattle；if this was the animal which had killed one after the other of their cows and calves，the time had come to put an end to her．I nodded．

He jumped from the car and slid back a few steps；at the same moment the lioness dived down behind the body of the giraffe，he ran round the giraffe to get within shot of her，and fired．I did not see her fall；when I got out and up to her she was lying dead in a big black pool．

There was no time to skin her，we must drive on if we were to cut off the safari at Narok．We gazed round and took note of the place，the smell of the dead giraffe was so strong that we could not very well pass it unknowingly．

But when we had driven a further two miles there was no more road．The tools of the road-labourers lay here；on the other side of them was the wide stony land，just grey in the dawn，all unbroken by any touch of man．We looked at the tools and at the country，we would have to leave Denys's friend to take his chance with the rifle．Afterwards，when he came back，he told us that he had never had an opportunity to use it．So we turned back，and as we turned we got our faces to the eastern sky，reddening over the plains and the hills．We drove towards it and talked all the time of the lioness．

The giraffe came within view，and by this time we could see him clearly and distinguish—where the light fell on to his side—the darker square spots on his skin．And as we came near to him we saw that there was a lion standing on him．In approaching we were a little lower than the carcass；the lion stood straight up over it，dark，and behind him the sky was now all aflame．Lion Passant Or．A bit of his mane was lifted by the wind．I rose up in the car，so strong was the impression that he made，and Denys at that said：“You shoot this time．”I was never keen to shoot with his rifle，which was too long and heavy for me，and gave me a bad shock；still，here the shot was a declaration of love，should the rifle not then be of the biggest caliber？As I shot it seemed to me that the lion jumped straight up in the air，and came down with his legs gathered under him．I stood，panting，in the grass，aglow with the plenipotence that a shot gives you，because you take effect at a distance．I walked round the carcass of the giraffe．There it was—the fifth act of a classic tragedy．They were all dead now．The giraffe was looking terribly big，austere，with his four stiff legs and long stiff neck，his belly torn open by the lions．The lioness，lying on her back，had a great haughty snarl on her face，she was the femme fatale of the tragedy．The lion was lying not far from her，and how was it that he had learned nothing by her fate？His head was laid on his two front paws，his mighty mane covered him as a royal mantle，he too was resting in a big pool，and by now the morning air was so light that it showed scarlet．

Denys and Kanuthia pulled up their sleeves and while the sun rose they skinned the lions．When they took a rest we had a bottle of claret，and raisins and almonds，from the car；I had brought them with us to eat on the road，because it was New Year's Day．We sat on the short grass and ate and drank．The dead lions，close by，looked magnificent in their nakedness，there was not a particle of superfluous fat on them，each muscle was a bold controlled curve，they needed no cloak，they were，all through，what they ought to be．

As we sat there，a shadow hastened over the grass and over my feet，and looking up I could distinguish，high in the light blue sky，the circling of the vultures．My heart was as light as if I had been flying it，up there，on a string，as you fly a kite．I made a poem：

The eagle's shadow runs across the plain，

Towards the distant，nameless，air-blue mountains．

But the shadows of the round young zebra

Sit close between their delicate hoofs all day，

Where they stand immovable，

And wait for the evening，wait to stretch out，blue，

Upon a plain，painted brick-red by the sunset，

And to wander to the water hole．



Denys and I had another dramatic adventure with lions．It happened，in reality，before the other，in the early days of our friendship．

One morning，during the spring rains，Mr．Nichols，a South African，who was then my manager，came to my house all aflame，to tell me，that in the night two lions had been to the farm and had killed two of our oxen．They had broken through the fence of the oxen's fold，and they had dragged the dead oxen into the coffee-plantation；one of them they had eaten up there，but the other was lying amongst the coffee-trees．Would I now write him a letter to go and get strychnine in Nairobi？He would have it laid out in the carcass at once，for he thought that the lions would be sure to come back in the night．

I thought it over；it went against me to lay out strychnine for lions，and I told him that I could not see my way to do it．At that his excitement changed over into exasperation．The lions，he said，if they were left in peace over this crime，would come back another time．The bullocks they had killed were our best working bullocks，and we could not afford to lose any more．The stable of my ponies，he reminded me，was not far from the oxen's enclosure：had I thought of that？I explained that I did not mean to keep the lions on the farm，only I thought that they should be shot and not poisoned．

“And who is going to shoot them？”asked Nichols．“I am no coward，but I am a married man and I have no wish to risk my life unnecessarily．”It was true that he was no coward，he was a plucky little man．“There would be no sense in it，”he said．No，I said，I did not mean to make him shoot the lions．But Mr．Finch-Hatton had arrived the night before and was in the house，he and I would go．“Oh，that is O．K．”said Nichols．

I then went in to find Denys．“Come now，”I said to him，“and let us go and risk our lives unnecessarily．For if they have got any value at all it is this that they have got none．Frei lebt wer sterben kann．”

We went down and found the dead bullock in the coffee-plantation，as Nichols had told me；it had hardly been touched by the lions．Their spoor was deep and clear in the soft ground，two big lions had been here in the night．It was easy to follow through the plantation and up to the wood round Belknap's house，but by the time that we came there it had rained so heavily that it was difficult to see anything，and in the grass and the bush at the edge of the wood we lost the track．

“What do you think，Denys，”I asked him，“will they come back tonight？”

Denys had great experience with lions．He said that they would come back early in the night to finish the meat，and that we ought to give them time to settle down on it，and go down to the field ourselves at nine o'clock．We would have to use an electric torch from his safari outfit，to shoot by，and he gave me the choice of the roles，but I would rather let him shoot and myself hold the torch for him．

In order that we might find our way up to the dead ox in the dark，we cut up strips of paper and fastened them on the rows of coffee-trees between which we meant to walk，marking our way in the manner of Hanzl and Gretl with their little white stones．It would take us straight to the kill，and at the end of it，twenty yards from the carcass，we tied a larger piece of paper to the tree，for here we would stop，sweep the light on and shoot．Late in the afternoon，when we took out the torch to try it，we found that the batteries of it had been running down and that the light it gave was only faint．There was no time to go in to Nairobi with it now，so that we should have to make the best of it as it was．

It was the day before Denys's birthday，and while we dined，he was in a melancholic mood，reflecting that he had not had enough out of life till now．But something，I consoled him，might still happen to him before his birthday morning．I told Juma to get out a bottle of wine to be ready for us when we should come back．I kept on thinking of the lions；where would they be now，at this moment？Were they crossing the river，slowly，silently，the one in front of the other，the gentle cold flow of the river turning round their chests and flanks？

At nine o'clock we went out．

It rained a little，but there was a moon；from time to time she put out her dim white face high up in the sky，behind layers and layers of thin clouds，and was then dimly mirrored in the white-flowering coffee-field．We passed the school at a distance；it was all lighted up．

At this sight a great wave of triumph and of pride in my people swept through me．I thought of King Solomon，who says：“The slothful man saith，There is a lion in the way；a lion is in the streets．”Here were two lions just outside their door，but my school children were not slothful and had not let the lions keep them from school．

We found our marked two rows of coffee-trees，paused a moment，and proceeded up between them，one in front of the other．We had moccasins on，and walked silently．I began to shake and tremble with excitement，I dared not come too near to Denys for fear that he might feel it and send me back，but I dared not keep too far away from him either，for he might need my torchlight any moment．

The lions，we found afterwards，had been on the kill．When they heard us，or smelt us，they had walked off it a little way into the coffee-field to let us pass．Probably because they thought that we were passing too slowly，the one of them gave a very low hoarse growl，in front and to the right of us．It was so low that we were not even sure that we had heard it，Denys stopped a second；without turning he asked me：“Did you hear？”“Yes，”I said．

We walked a little again and the deep growling was repeated，this time straight to the right．“Put on the light，”Denys said．It was not altogether an easy job，for he was much taller than I，and I had to get the light over his shoulder on to his rifle and further on．As I lighted the torch the whole world changed into a brilliantly lighted stage，the wet leaves of the coffee-trees shone，the clods of the ground showed up quite clearly．

First the circle of light struck a little wide-eyed jackal，like a small fox；I moved it on，and there was the lion．He stood facing us straight，and he looked very light，with all the black African night behind him．When the shot fell，close to me，I was unprepared for it，even without comprehension of what it meant，as if it had been thunder，as if I had been myself shifted into the place of the lion．He went down like a stone．“Move on，move on，”Denys cried to me．I turned the torch further on，but my hand shook so badly that the circle of light，which held all the world，and which I commanded，danced a dance．I heard Denys laugh beside me in the dark．—“The torch-work on the second lion，”he said to me later，“was a little shaky．”—But in the centre of the dance was the second lion，going away from us and half hidden by a coffee-tree．As the light reached him he turned his head and Denys shot．He fell out of the circle，but got up and into it again，he swung round towards us，and just as the second shot fell，he gave one long irascible groan．

Africa，in a second，grew endlessly big，and Denys and I，standing upon it，infinitely small．Outside our torchlight there was nothing but darkness，in the darkness in two directions there were lions，and from the sky rain．But when the deep roar died out，there was no movement anywhere，and the lion lay still，his head turned away on to his side，as in a gesture of disgust．There were two big dead animals in the coffee field，and the silence of night all around．

We walked up to the lions and paced out the distance．From where we had stood the first lion was thirty yards away and the other twenty-five．They were both full-grown，young，strong，fat lions．The two close friends，out in the hills or on the plains，yesterday had taken the same great adventure into their heads，and in it they had died together．

By now all the school children were coming out of the school，pouring down the road to stop in sight of us and there to cry out in a low soft voice：“Msabu．Are you there？Are you there？Msabu，Msabu．”

I sat on a lion and cried back to them：“Yes I am．”

Then they went on，louder and more boldly：“Has Bedâr shot the lions？Both two？”When they found that it was so，they were at once all over the place，like a swarm of small spring hares of the night，jumping up and down．They，then and there，made a song upon the event；it ran as follows：“Three shots．Two lions．Three shots．Two lions．”They embroidered and embellished it as they sang it，one clear voice falling in after the other：“Three good shots，two big strong bad kali lions．”And then they all joined into an intoxicated refrain：“A．B．C．D．”—because they came straight from the school，and had their heads filled with wisdom．

In a short time a great number of people came to the spot，the labourers from the mill，the squatters of the near manyattas，and my houseboys，carrying hurricane-lamps．They stood round the lions and talked about them，then Kanuthia and the sice，who had brought knives，set to skin them．It was the skin of one of these lions that，later，I gave to the Indian High Priest．Pooran Singh himself appeared on the stage，in a negligée which made him look unbelievably slight，his melliferous Indian smile shone in the midst of his thick black beard，he stuttered with delight when he spoke．He was anxious to procure for himself the fat of the lions，that with his people is held in high esteem as a medicine—from the pantomime by which he expressed himself to me，I believe against rheumatism and impotence．With all this the coffee-field became very lively，the rain stopped，the moon shone down on them all．

We went back to the house and Juma brought and opened our bottle．We were too wet，and too dirty with mud and blood to sit down to it，but stood up before a flaming fire in the dining-room and drank our live，singing wine up quickly．We did not speak one word．In our hunt we had been a unity and we had nothing to say to one another．

Our friends got a good deal of entertainment out of our adventure．Old Mr．Bulpett when next we came in to a dance at the Club would not speak to us the whole evening．




To Denys Finch-Hatton I owe what was，I think，the greatest，the most transporting pleasure of my life on the farm：I flew with him over Africa．There，where there are few or no roads and where you can land on the plains，flying becomes a thing of real and vital importance in your life，it opens up a world．Denys had brought out his Moth machine；it could land on my plain on the farm only a few minutes from the house，and we were up nearly every day．

You have tremendous views as you get up above the African highlands，surprising combinations and changes of light and colouring，the rainbow on the green sunlit land，the gigantic upright clouds and big wild black storms，all swing round you in a race and a dance．The lashing hard showers of rain whiten the air askance．The language is short of words for the experiences of flying，and will have to invent new words with time．When you have flown over the Rift Valley and the volcanoes of Suswa and Longonot，you have travelled far and have been to the lands on the other side of the moon．You may at other times fly low enough to see the animals on the plains and to feel towards them as God did when he had just created them，and before he commissioned Adam to give them names．

But it is not the visions but the activity which makes you happy，and the joy and glory of the flyer is the flight itself．It is a sad hardship and slavery to people who live in towns，that in all their movements they know of one dimension only；they walk along the line as if they were led on a string．The transition from the line to the plane into the two dimensions，when you wander across a field or through a wood，is a splendid liberation to the slaves，like the French Revolution．But in the air you are taken into the full freedom of the three dimensions；after long ages of exile and dreams the homesick heart throws itself into the arms of space．The laws of gravitation and time，

…in life's green grove，

Sport like tame beasts，none knew how

gentle they could be！



Every time that I have gone up in an aeroplane and looking down have realised that I was free of the ground，I have had the consciousness of a great new discovery．“I see，”I have thought．“This was the idea．And now I understand everything．”




One day Denys and I flew to Lake Natron，ninety miles south east of the farm，and more than four thousand feet lower，two thousand feet above sea level．Lake Natron is the place from where they take soda．The bottom of the lake and the shores are like some sort of whitish concrete，with a strong，sour and salt smell．

The sky was blue，but as we flew from the plains in over the stony and bare lower country，all colour seemed to be scorched out of it．The whole landscape below us looked like delicately marked tortoise-shell．Suddenly，in the midst of it was the lake．The white bottom，shining through the water，gives it，when seen from the air，a striking，an unbelievable azure colour so clear that for a moment you shut your eyes at it；the expanse of water lies in the bleak tawny land like a big bright aquamarine．We had been flying high，now we went down，and as we sank our own shade，dark blue，floated under us upon the light blue lake．Here live thousands of flamingoes，although I do not know how they exist in the brackish water—surely there are no fish here．At our approach they spread out in large circles and fans，like the rays of a setting sun，like an artful Chinese pattern on silk or porcelain，forming itself and changing，as we looked at it．

We landed on the white shore，that was white-hot as an oven，and lunched there，taking shelter against the sun under the wing of the aeroplane．If you stretched out your hand from the shade，the sun was so hot that it hurt you．Our bottles of beer when they first arrived with us，straight out of the ether，were pleasantly cold，but before we had finished them，in a quarter of an hour，they became as hot as a cup of tea．

While we were lunching，a party of Masai warriors appeared on the horizon，and approached quickly．They must have spied the aeroplane landing from a distance，and resolved to have a close look at it，and a walk of any length，even in a country like this，means nothing to a Masai．They came along，the one in front of the other，naked，tall and narrow，their weapons glinting；dark like peat on the yellow-grey sand．At the feet of each of them lay and marched a small pool of shadow：these were，besides our own，the only shadows in the country as far as the eye reached．When they came up to us they fell in line，there were five of them．They stuck their heads together and began to talk to one another about the aeroplane and us．A generation ago they would have been fatal to us to meet．After a time one of them advanced and spoke to us．As they could only speak Masai and we understood but little of the language，the conversation soon slackened，he stepped back to his fellows and a few minutes later they all turned their backs upon us，and walked away，in single file，with the wide white burning salt-plain before them．

“Would you care，”said Denys，“to fly to Naivasha？But the country lying between is very rough，we could not possibly land anywhere on the way．So we shall have to go up high and keep up at twelve thousand feet．”

The flight from Lake Natron to Naivasha was Das Ding an sich．We took a bee-line，and kept at twelve thousand feet all the way，which is so high that there is nothing to look down for．At Lake Natron I had taken off my lambskin-lined cap，now up here the air squeezed my forehead，as cold as iced water；all my hair flew backwards as if my head was being pulled off．This path，in fact，was the same as was，in the opposite direction，every evening taken by the Roc，when，with an elephant for her young in each talon，she swished from Uganda home to Arabia．Where you are sitting in front of your pilot，with nothing but space before you，you feel that he is carrying you upon the outstretched palms of his hands，as the Djinn carried Prince Ali through the air，and that the wings that bear you onward are his．We landed at the farm of our friends at Naivasha；the mad diminutive houses，and the very small trees surrounding them，all threw themselves flat upon their backs as they saw us descending．

When Denys and I had not time for long journeys we went out for a short flight over the Ngong Hills，generally about sunset．These hills，which are amongst the most beautiful in the world，are perhaps at their loveliest seen from the air，when the ridges，bare towards the four peaks，mount，and run side by side with the aeroplane，or suddenly sink down and flatten out into a small lawn．

Here in the hills there were buffaloes．I had even，in my very young days—when I could not live till I had killed a specimen of each kind of African game—shot a bull out here．Later on，when I was not so keen to shoot as to watch the wild animals，I had been out to see them again．I had camped in the hills by a spring half way to the top，bringing my servants，tents，and provisions with me，and Farah and I had been up in the dark，ice cold mornings to creep and crawl through bush and long grass，in the hope of catching a glimpse of the herd；but twice I had had to go back without success．That the herd lived there，neighbours of mine to the west，was still a value in the life on the farm，but they were serious-minded，self-sufficient neighbours，the old nobility of the hills，now somehow reduced；they did not receive much．

But one afternoon as I was having tea with some friends of mine from up-country，outside the house，Denys came flying from Nairobi and went over our heads out westwards；a little while after he turned and came back and landed on the farm．Lady Delamere and I drove down to the plain to fetch him up，but he would not get out of his aeroplane．

“The buffalo are out feeding in the hills，”he said，“come out and have a look at them．”

“I cannot come，”I said，“I have got a tea-party up at the house．”

“But we will go and see them and be back in a quarter of an hour，”said he．

This sounded to me like the propositions which people make to you in a dream．Lady Delamere would not fly，so I went up with him．We flew in the sun，but the hillside lay in a transparent brown shade，which soon we got into．It did not take us long to spy the buffalo from the air．Upon one of the long rounded green ridges which run，like folds of a cloth gathered together at each peak，down the side of the Ngong mountain，a herd of twenty-seven Buffalo were grazing．First we saw them a long way below us，like mice moving gently on a floor，but we dived down，circling over and along their ridge，a hundred and fifty feet above them and well within shooting distance；we counted them as they peacefully blended and separated．There was one very old big black bull in the herd，one or two younger bulls，and a number of calves．The open stretch of sward upon which they walked was closed in by bush；had a stranger approached on the ground they would have heard or scented him at once，but they were not prepared for advance from the air．We had to keep moving above them all the time．They heard the noise of our machine and stopped grazing，but they did not seem to have it in them to look up．In the end they realized that something very strange was about；the old bull first walked out in front of the herd，raising his hundredweight horns，braving the unseen enemy，his four feet planted on the ground—suddenly he began to trot down the ridge and after a moment he broke into a canter．The whole clan now followed him，stampeding headlong down，and as they switched and plunged into the bush，dust and loose stones rose in their wake．In the thicket they stopped and kept close together：it looked as if a small glade in the hill had been paved with dark grey stones．Here they believed themselves to be covered to the view，and so they were to anything moving along the ground，but they could not hide themselves from the eyes of the bird of the air．We flew up and away．It was like having been taken into the heart of the Ngong Hills by a secret unknown road．

When I came back to my tea-party，the teapot on the stone table was still so hot that I burned my fingers on it．The prophet had the same experience when he upset a jug of water，and the Archangel Gabriel took him，and flew with him through the seven heavens，and when he returned，the water had not yet run out of the jug．

In the Ngong Hills there also lived a pair of eagles．Denys in the afternoons used to say：“Let us go and visit the eagles．”I have once seen one of them sitting on a stone near the top of the mountain，and getting up from it，but otherwise they spent their life up in the air．Many times we have chased one of these eagles，careening and throwing ourselves on to one wing and then to the other，and I believe that the sharp-sighted bird played with us．Once，when we were running side by side，Denys stopped his engine in mid-air，and as he did so I heard the eagle screech．

The Natives liked the aeroplane，and for a time it was the fashion on the farm to portray her，so that I would find sheets of paper in the kitchen，or the kitchen wall itself covered with drawings of her，with the letters ABAK carefully copied out．But they did not really take any interest in her or in our flying．

Natives dislike speed，as we dislike noise；it is to them，at the best，hard to bear．They are also on friendly terms with time，and the plan of beguiling or killing it does not come into their heads．In fact the more time you can give them，the happier they are，and if you commission a Kikuyu to hold your horse while you make a visit，you can see by his face that he hopes you will be a long，long time about it．He does not try to pass the time then，but sits down and lives．

Neither do the Natives have much sympathy with any kind of machinery or mechanics．A group of the young generation have been carried away by the enthusiasm of the European for the motor-car，but an old Kikuyu said to me of them that they would die young，and it is likely that he was right，for renegades come of a weak line of the nation．Amongst the inventions of civilization which the Natives admire and appreciate are matches，a bicycle and a rifle，still they will drop these the moment there is any talk of a cow．

Frank Greswolde Williams，of the Kedong Valley，took a Masai with him to England as a sice，and told me that a week after his arrival he rode his horses in Hyde Park as if he had been born in London．I asked this man when he came back to Africa what he found very good in England．He thought my question over with a grave face and after a long time courteously said that the white men had got very fine bridges．

I have never seen an old Native who，for things which moved by themselves without apparent interference by man or by the forces of Nature，expressed anything but distrust and a certain feeling of shame．The human mind turns away its eye from witchcraft as from something unseemly．It may be forced to take an interest in the effects of it，but it will have nothing to do with the inside working，and no one has ever tried to squeeze out of a witch the exact recipe for her brew．

Once，when Denys and I had been up，and were landing on the plain of the farm，a very old Kikuyu came up and talked to us：

“You were up very high today，”he said，“we could not see you，only hear the aeroplane sing like a bee．”

I agreed that we had been up high．

“Did you see God？”he asked．

“No，Ndwetti，”I said，“we did not see God．”

“Aha，then you were not up high enough，”he said，“but now tell me：do you think that you will be able to get up high enough to see him？”

“I do not know，Ndwetti，”I said．

“And you，Bedâr，”he said，turning to Denys，“what do you think？Will you get up high enough in your aeroplane to see God？”

“Really I do not know，”said Denys．

“Then，”said Ndwetti，“I do not know at all why you two go on flying．”





FROM AN IMMIGRANT'S NOTEBOOK





The Fireflies


Here in the highlands，when the long rains are over，and in the first week of June nights begin to be cold，we get the fireflies in the woods．

On an evening you will see two or three of them，adventurous lonely stars floating in the clear air，rising and lowering，as if upon waves，or as if curtseying．To that rhythm of their flight they lighten and put out their diminutive lamps．You may catch the insect and make it shine upon the palm of your hand，giving out a strange light，a mysterious message；it turns the flesh pale green in a small circle round it．The next night there are hundreds and hundreds in the woods．

For some reason they keep within a certain height，four or five feet，above the ground．It is impossible then not to imagine that a whole crowd of children of six or seven years are running through the dark forest carrying candles，little sticks dipped in a magic fire，joyously jumping up and down，and gambolling as they run，and swinging their small pale torches merrily．The woods are filled with a wild frolicsome life，and it is all perfectly silent．





The Roads of Life


When I was a child I was shown a picture—a kind of moving picture inasmuch as it was created before your eyes and while the artist was telling the story of it．This story was told，every time，in the same words．



In a little round house with a round window and a little triangular garden in front there lived a man．

Not far from the house there was a pond with a lot of fish in it．



One night the man was woken up by a terrible noise，and set out in the dark to find the cause of it．He took the road to the pond．

Here the story-teller began to draw，as upon a map of the movements of an army，a plan of the roads taken by the man．



He first ran to the south．Here he stumbled over a big stone in the middle of the road，and a little farther he fell into a ditch，got up，fell into a ditch，got up，fell into a third ditch and got out of that．



Then he saw that he had been mistaken，and ran back to the north．But here again the noise seemed to him to come from the south，and he again ran back there．He first stumbled over a big stone in the middle of the road，then a little later he fell into a ditch，got up，fell into another ditch，got up，fell into a third ditch，and got out of that．



He now distinctly hear that the noise came from the end of the pond．He rushed to the place，and say that a big leakage had been made in the dam，and the water was running out with all the fish in it．He set to work and stopped the hole and only when this had been done did he go back to bed．



When now the next morning the man looked out of his little round window—thus the tale was finished，as dramatically as possible—what did he see？—

A stork！

I am glad that I have been told this story and I shall remember it in the hour of need．The man in the story was cruelly deceived，and had obstacles put in his way．He must have thought：“What ups and downs！What a run of bad luck！”He must have wondered what was the idea of all his trials：he could not know that it was a stork．But through them all he kept his purpose in view；nothing made him turn round and go home；he finished his course，he kept his faith．That man had his reward．In the morning he saw the stork．He must have laughed out loud then．

The tight place，the dark pit in which I am now lying，of what bird is it the talon？When the design of my life is complete，shall I，shall other people see a stork？

Infandum，Regina，jubes renovare dolarem．Troy in flames，seven years of exile，thirteen good ships lost．What is to come out of it？“Unsurpassed elegance，majestic stateliness，and sweet tenderness．”

You are bewildered when you read the second article of faith of the Christian Church：That he was crucified，dead and buried，that he went down into Hell，and also did rise again the third day，that he ascended into Heaven，and from thence shall come again．

What ups and downs，as terrible as those of the man in the story．What is to come out of all this？—The second article of the Creed of half the world．





The Wild came to the Aid of the Wild


My manager during the war had been buying up oxen for the army．He told me that he had then，down in the Masai Reserve，bought from the Masai a number of young oxen，which were offspring of Masai cattle and buffalo．It is a much debated question whether it is possible to cross domestic animals with the game；many people have tried to create a type of small horse fitted to the country，by breeding from zebra and horses，though I myself have never seen such cross-breeds．But my Manager assured me that these oxen were really half-buffalo．They had been，the Masai told him，a much longer time growing up than the ordinary cattle，and the Masai，who were proud of them，were by this time pleased to get rid of them，as they were very wild．

It was found to be hard work to train these oxen for the wagon or plough．One strong young animal amongst them gave my manager and his native ox-drivers endless trouble．He stormed against the men，he broke their yokes，he foamed and bellowed；when tied up he shovelled up earth in thick black clouds，he turned up the bloodshot white of his eyes，and blood，the men said，was running from his nose．The man，like the beast，towards the end of their struggle，was dead beat，the sweat streaming down his aching body．

“To break the heart of this ox，”my manager narrated，“I had him thrown in the bullocks' paddock，with his four legs tied hard together，and a rein round his muzzle，and even then，as he was lying dumb on the ground，long scalding jets of steam stood out from his nose and terrible snorts and sighs came from his throat．I was looking forward to seeing him under the yoke for many years to come．I went to bed in my tent and I kept on dreaming of this black ox．I was woken up by a big row，the dogs barking and the Natives shouting and yelling down by the paddock．Two herdboys came into my tent all trembling and told me that they believed a lion had got in amongst the oxen．We ran down to the place and took lamps with us，and I myself brought my rifle．As we came near to the paddock the noise died down a little．In the light of the lamps I saw a speckled thing making off．A leopard had been at the tied-up ox，and had eaten the right hind leg off him．We would never come to see him in the yoke now．”

“Then，”said my Manager，“I took my rifle and shot the ox．”





Esa's Story


At the time of the war I had a cook named Esa，an old man of much sense and a gentle disposition．One day when I was in Mackinnon's grocery shop in Nairobi，buying tea and spices，a small lady with a sharp face came up to me and remarked that she knew Esa was in my service；I said that it was so．“But he has been with me before，”said the lady，“and I want him back．”I said that I was sorry about that，as she would not get him．“Oh，I do not know about that，”she said．“My husband is a government official．Will you please tell Esa when you go home，that I want him back，and that if he does not come he will be taken for the Carrier Corps？I understand，”she added，“that you have got enough servants without Esa．”

I did not tell Esa of these happenings straight away；only the next evening did I remember about them，and told him that I had met his old mistress，and of what she had said to me．To my surprise Esa was immediately beside himself with fear and despair．“Oh，why did you not tell me at once，Memsahib！”said he，“the lady will do what she has told you，and I must leave you tonight．”“That is all nonsense，”I said．“I do not think that they can take you like that．”“God help me，”said Esa，“I am afraid it may be too late already．”“But what am I to do for a cook，Esa？”I asked him．“Well，”said Esa，“you will not have me for a cook either when I am with the Carrier Corps，or when I am lying dead，as I shall surely then be very soon．”

So deep was the fear of the Carrier Corps in the people in those days that Esa would not listen to anything I had to say．He asked me for the loan of a hurricane-lamp，and set off in the night to Nairobi，with what belongings he had in the world tied up in a cloth．

Esa was away from the farm for nearly a year．During that time I saw him a couple of times in Nairobi and once I passed him on the Nairobi road．He was growing old and thin，and drawn in the face，in the course of this year；his dark round head was going grey on the top．In the town he would not stop to speak to me，but when we met on the flat road and I pulled up my car，he put down the chicken-coop which he was carrying on his head，and settled down to a talk．

He had，as before，a gentle manner，but all the same he was changed，and it was now difficult to get into contact with him；he remained，all through our conversation，absent-minded，as if at a distance．He had been ill-used by fate，and deadly frightened，and had had to draw upon resources unknown to me，and through these experiences he had become chastened or clarified．It was like talking with an old acquaintance who has entered upon his novitiate in a monastery．

He asked me about things on the farm，taking it，as Native servants usually do，that his fellow-servants in his absence were behaving as badly as possible to the white master．“When will the war be over？”he asked me．I said that I had been told that now it would not last much longer．“If it lasts ten years longer，”he said，“you must know that I shall have forgotten to make the dishes you have taught me．”

The mind of the little old Kikuyu，upon the road across the plains，was running upon the same line as that of Brillat-Savarin，who said that if the Revolution had lasted five years longer，the art of making a chicken ragout would have been lost．

It was obvious that Esa's regrets were mainly on my behalf，and to put an end to his commiserations I asked him how he was himself．He thought my question over for a minute；there were thoughts which had to be collected from far away before he could answer．“Do you remember，Memsahib？”he said in the end，“that you said it was hard on the oxen of the Indian firewood-contractors to be inspanned every day，and never to have a whole day's rest，as the farm oxen have got？Now，with the lady，I am like an Indian firewood-contractor's ox．”Esa looked away when he had spoken，apologetically．Natives have in themselves very little feeling for animals；my saying about the Indian's oxen probably had struck him as very far-fetched．That now he should，on his own，come back to it for himself，was to him an unaccountable thing．

During the war it was to me a cause of much annoyance that all letters which I wrote or received，were opened by a little sleepy Swedish censor in Nairobi．He can never have found anything the least suspicious in them，but he came，I believe，within a monotonous life，to take an interest in the people on whom they turned，and to read my letters as you read a serial in a magazine．I used to add in my own letters a few threats against our censor，to be carried out after the end of the war，for him to read．When the end of the war came he may have remembered these threats，or he may on his own have woken up and repented；in any case he sent a runner to the farm with news of the Armistice．I was alone in the house when the runner arrived；I walked out in the woods．It was very silent there，and it was strange to think that it was silent on the fronts of France and Flanders as well—all the guns had been stilled．In this stillness Europe and Africa seemed near to one another，as if you could have walked by the forest-path on to Vimy Ridge．When I came back to the house I saw a figure standing outside．It was Esa with his bundle．He at once told me that he had come back and that he had brought me a present．

Esa's present was a picture，framed and under glass，of a tree，very carefully penned down in ink，every one of its hundred leaves painted a clear green．Upon each leaf，in diminutive Arabic letters，a word was written in red ink．I take it that the writings came out of the Koran，but Esa was incapable of explaining what they meant；he kept on wiping off the glass with his sleeve and assuring me that it was a very good present．He told me that he had had the picture made，during his year of trial，by the old Mohammedan priest of Nairobi，it must have taken the old man hours and hours to print it down．

Esa now stayed with me till he died．





The Iguana


In the Reserve I have sometimes come upon the Iguanas，the big lizards，as they were sunning themselves upon a flat stone in a river-bed．They are not pretty in shape，but nothing can be imagined more beautiful than their colouring．They shine like a heap of precious stones or like a pane cut out of an old church window．When，as you approach，they swish away，there is a flash of azure，green and purple over the stones；the colour seems to be standing behind them in the air，like a comet's luminous tail．

Once I shot an Iguana．I thought that I should be able to make some pretty things from his skin．A strange thing happened then，that I have never afterwards forgotten．As I went up to him，where he was lying dead upon his stone，and actually while I was walking the few steps，he faded and grew pale；all colour died out of him as in one long sigh，and by the time that I touched him he was grey and dull like a lump of concrete．It was the live impetuous blood pulsating within the animal which had radiated out all that glow and splendour．Now that the flame was put out，and the soul had flown，the iguana was as dead as a sandbag．

Often since I have，in some sort，shot an guana，and I have remembered the one of the Reserve．Up at Meru I saw a young Native girl with a bracelet on，a leather strap two inches wide，and embroidered all over with very small turquoise-coloured beads which varied a little in colour and played in green，light blue and ultra marine．It was an extraordinarily live thing；it seemed to draw breath on her arm，so that I wanted it for myself，and made Farah buy it from her．No sooner had it come upon my own arm than it gave up the ghost．It was nothing now，a small，cheap，purchased article of finery．It had been the play of colours，the duet between the turquoise and the“nègre”—that quick，sweet，brownish black，like peat and black pottery，of the Native's skin—that had created the life of the bracelet．

In the Zoological Museum of Pietermaritzburg，I have seen，in a stuffed deep-water fish in a showcase，the same combination of colouring，which there had survived death；it made me wonder what life can well be like，on the bottom of the sea，to send up something so live and airy．I stood in Meru and looked at my pale hand and at the dead bracelet，it was as if an injustice had been done to a noble thing，as if truth had been suppressed．So sad did it seem that I remembered the saying of the hero in a book that I had read as a child：“I have conquered them all，but I am standing amongst graves．”

In a foreign country and with foreign species of life one should take measures to find out whether things will be keeping their value when dead．To the settlers of East Africa I give the advice：“For the sake of your own eyes and heart，shoot not the guana．”





Farah and the Merchant of Venice


Once a friend at home wrote out to me and described a new staging of The Merchant of Venice．In the evening as I was reading the letter over again，the play became vivid to me，and seemed to fill the house，so much，that I called in Farah to talk with him about it，and explained the plot of the comedy to him．

Farah，like all people of African blood，liked to hear a story told，but only when he was sure that he and I were alone in the house did he consent to listen to one．It was therefore when the houseboys were back in their own huts，and any passer-by from the farm，looking in through the windows，would have believed him and me to be discussing household matters，that I narrated，and he listened，standing up immovable at the end of the table，his serious eyes on my face．

Farah gave his full attention to the affairs of Antonio，Bassanio and Shylock．Here was a big，complicated business deal，somewhat on the verge of the law，the real thing to the heart of a Somali．He asked me a question or two as to the clause of the pound of flesh：it obviously seemed to him an eccentric，but not impossible agreement；men might go in for that sort of thing．And here the story began to smell of blood—his interest in it rose．When Portia came upon the stage，he pricked his ears；I imagined that he saw her as a woman of his own tribe，Fathima with all sails set，crafty and insinuating，out to outman man．Coloured people do not take sides in a tale，the interest to them lies in the ingeniousness of the plot itself；and the Somali，who in real life have a strong sense of values，and a gift for moral indignation，give these a rest in their fiction．Still，here Farah's sympathy was with Shylock，who had come down with the cash；he repugned his defeat．

“What？”said he．“Did the Jew give up his claim？He should not have done that．The flesh was due to him，it was little enough for him to get for all that money．”

“But what else could he do，”I asked，“when he must not take one drop of blood？”

“Memsahib，”said Farah，“he could have used a redhot knife．That brings out no blood．”

“But，”I said，“he was not allowed to take either more or less than one pound of flesh．”

“And who，”said Farah，“would have been frightened by that，exactly a Jew？He might have taken little bits at a time，with a small scale at hand to weight it on，till he had got just one pound．Had the Jew no friends to give him advice？”

All Somalis have in their countenance something exceedingly dramatic．Farah，with the slightest change of mien and carriage，now took on dangerous aspect，as if he were really in the Court of Venice，putting heart into his friend or partner Shylock，in the face of the crowd of Antonio's friends，and of the Doge of Venice himself．His eyes flickered up and down the figure of the merchant before him，with the breast bared to the knife．

“Look，Memsahib，”he said，“he could have taken small bits，very small．He could have done that man a lot of harm，even a long time before he had got that one pound of his flesh．”

I said：“But in the story the Jew gave it up．”

“Yes，that was a great pity，Memsahib，”said Farah．





The Elite of Bournemouth


I had as neighbour a settler who had been a doctor at home．Once，when the wife of one of my houseboys was about to die in childbirth，and I could not get into Nairobi，because the long rains had ruined the roads，I wrote to my neighbour and asked him to do me the great service to come over and help her．He very kindly came，in the midst of a terrible thunderstorm and torrents of tropical rain，and，at the last moment，by his skill，he saved the life of the woman and the child．

Afterwards he wrote me a letter to say，that although he had for once，on my appeal，treated a Native，I must understand that he could not let that sort of thing occur again．I myself would fully realize the fact，he felt convinced，when he informed me that he had before now practised to the élite of Bournemouth．





Of Pride


The neighbourhood of the Game Reserve and the presence，outside our boundary，of the big game，gave a particular character to the farm，as if we had been the neighbours of a great king．Very proud things were about，and made their nearness felt．

The barbarian loves his own pride，and hates，or disbelieves in，the pride of others．I will be a civilized being，I will love the pride of my adversaries，of my servants，and my lover；and my house shall be，in all humility，in the wilderness a civilized place．

Pride is faith in the idea that God had，when he made us．A proud man is conscious of the idea，and aspires to realize it．He does not strive towards a happiness，or comfort，which may be irrelevant to God's idea of him．His success is the idea of God，successfully carried through，and he is in love with his destiny．As the good citizen finds his happiness in the fulfilment of his duty to the community，so does the proud man find his happiness in the fulfilment of his fate．

People who have no pride are not aware of any idea of God in the making of them，and sometimes they make you doubt that there has ever been much of an idea，or else it has been lost，and who shall find it again？They have got to accept as success what others warrant to be so，and to take their happiness，and even their own selves，at the quotation of the day．They tremble，with reason，before their fate．

Love the pride of God beyond all things，and the pride of your neighbour as your own．The pride of lions：do not shut them up in zoos．The pride of your dogs：let them not grow fat．Love the pride of your fellow-partisans，and allow them no self-pity．

Love the pride of the conquered nations，and leave them to honour their father and their mother．





The Oxen


Saturday afternoon was a blessed time on the farm．First of all，there would now be no mail in till Monday afternoon，so that no distressing business letters could reach us till then，and this fact in itself seemed to close the whole place in，as within an enceinte．Secondly，everybody was looking forward to the day of Sunday，when they would rest or play all the day，and the squatters could work on their own land．The thought of the oxen on Saturday pleased me more than all other things．I used to walk down to their paddock at six o'clock，when they were coming in after the day's work and a few hours' grazing．Tomorrow，I thought，they would do nothing but graze all day．

We had one hundred and thirty-two oxen on the farm，which meant eight working teams and a few spare oxen．Now in the golden dust of the sunset they came wandering home across the plain in a long row，walking sedately，as they did all things；while I sat sedately on the fence of the paddock，smoking a cigarette of peace，and watching them．Here came Nyose，Ngufu and Faru，with Msungu—which means a white man．The drivers also often give to their teams the proper names of white men，and Delamere is a common name in an ox．Here came old Malinda，the big yellow ox that I liked best of the lot；his skin was strangely marked with shadowy figures，like starfishes，from which pattern perhaps he had his name，for Malinda means a skirt．

As in civilized countries all people have a chronic bad conscience towards the slums，and feel uncomfortable when they think of them，so in Africa you have got a bad conscience，and feel a pang，when you think of the oxen．But towards the oxen on the farm，I felt as，I suppose，a king will be feeling towards his slums：“You are I，and I am you．”

The oxen in Africa have carried the heavy load of the advance of European civilization．Wherever new land has been broken they have broken it，panting and pulling knee-deep in the soil before the ploughs，the long whips in the air over them．Where a road has been made they have made it；and they have trudged the iron and tools through the land，to the yelling and shouting of the drivers，by tracks in the dust and the long grass of the plains，before there ever were any roads．They have been inspanned before daybreak，and have sweated up and down the long hills，and across dungas and river-beds，through the burning hours of the day．The whips have marked their sides，and you will often see oxen that have had an eye，or both of them，taken away by the long cutting whip lashes．The wagon-oxen of many Indian and white contractors worked every day，all their lives through，and did not know of the Sabbath．

It is a strange thing that we have done to the oxen．The bull is in a constant stage of fury，rolling his eyes，shovelling up the earth，upset by everything that gets within his range of vision—still he has got a life of his own，fire comes from his nostrils，and new life from his loins；his days are filled with his vital cravings and satisfactions．All of that we have taken away from the oxen，and in reward we have claimed their existence for ourselves．The oxen walk along within our own daily life，pulling hard all the time，creatures without a life，things made for our use．They have moist，limpid，violet eyes，soft muzzles，silky ears，they are patient and dull in all their ways；sometimes they look as if they were thinking about things．

There was in my time a law against bringing a wagon or cart on the roads without a brake，and the wagon-drivers were supposed to put on the brakes down all the long hills of the country．But the law was not kept；half the wagons and carts on the roads had no brakes to them，and on the others the brakes were but rarely put on．This made downhill work terribly hard on the oxen．They had to hold the loaded wagons up with their bodies，they laid their heads back under the labour until their horns touched the hump on their backs；their sides went like a pair of bellows．I have many times seen the carts of the firewood merchants which came along the Ngong Road，going into Nairobi the one after the other，like a long caterpillar，gain speed down the hill in the Forest Reserve，the oxen violently zig-zagging down in front of them．I have also seen the oxen stumble and fall under the weight of the cart，at the bottom of the hill．

The oxen thought：“Such is life，and the conditions of the world．They are hard，hard．It has all to be borne—there is nothing for it．It is a terribly difficult thing to get the carts down the hill，it is a matter of life and death．It cannot be helped．”

If the fat Indians of Nairobi，who owned the carts，could have brought themselves to pay two rupees and have the brakes put in order，or if the slow young Native driver on the top of the loaded cart，had had it in him to get off and put on the brake，if it was there，then it could have been helped，and the oxen could have walked quietly down the hill．But the oxen did not know，and went on，day after day，in their heroic and desperate struggle with the conditions of life．





Of the Two Races


The relation between the white and the black race in Africa in many ways resembles the relation between the two sexes．

If the one of the two sexes were told that they did not play any greater part in the life of the other sex than this other sex plays within their own existence，they would be shocked and hurt．If the lover or the husband were told that he did not play any greater part in the life of his wife or his mistress than she played in his own existence，he would be puzzled and indignant．If a wife or a mistress were told that she did not play any greater part in the life of her husband or her lover than he played in her life，she would be exasperated．

The real old-time men's story that was never meant to get to the ears of women，goes to prove this theory；and the talk of the women，when they sit amongst themselves and know that no man can hear them，goes to prove it．

The tales that white people tell you of their Native servants are conceived in the same spirit．If they had been told that they played no more important part in the lives of the Natives than the Natives played in their own lives，they would have been highly indignant and ill at ease．

If you had told the Natives that they played no greater part in the life of the white people than the white people played in their lives，they would never have believed you，but would have laughed at you．Probably in Native circles，stories are passing about，and being repeated，which prove the all-absorbing interest of the white people in the Kikuyu or Kawirondo，and their complete dependence upon them．





A War-time Safari


When the war broke out，my husband and the two Swedish assistants on the farm volunteered and went down to the German border，where a provisional intelligence service was being organized by Lord Delamere．I was then alone on the farm．But shortly afterwards there began to be talk of a concentration camp for the white women of the country；they were believed to be exposed to danger from the Natives．I was thoroughly frightened then，and thought：If I am to go into a ladies' concentration camp in this country for months—and who knows how long the war is going to last？—I shall die．A few days later I got the chance to go，with a young Swedish farmer，a neighbour of ours，to Kijabe，a station higher up the railway line，and there to be in charge of a camp to which the runners from the border brought in their news，which had then to be telegraphed on to headquarters in Nairobi．

At Kijabe I had my tent near the station，amongst stacks of firewood for the railway engines．As the runners came in at all hours of the day or night，I came to work much together with the Goan stationmaster．He was a small，mild man，with a burning thirst for knowledge，unaffected by the war around him．He asked me many questions of my country，and made me teach him a little Danish，which he thought would at some time come in highly useful to him．He had a small boy of ten，named Victor；one day as I walked up to the station，through the trellis-work of the Verandah，I heard him going on teaching Victor his grammar：“Victor，what is a pronoun？—what is a pronoun，Victor？—You do not know？—Five hundred times have I told you！”

The people down by the border kept on demanding provisions and ammunition to be sent to them；my husband wrote and instructed me to load up four ox-wagons and to send them down as soon as possible．But I must not，he wrote，let them go without a white man in charge of them，for nobody knew where the Germans were，and the Masai were in a state of high excitement at the idea of war，and on the move all over the Reserve．In those days the Germans were supposed to be everywhere，and we kept sentinels by the great railway bridge of Kijabe to prevent them blowing it up．

I engaged a young South African by the name of Klapprott，to go with the wagons，but when they were all loaded up，on the evening before the expedition was to start off，he was arrested as a German．He was not a German，and could prove it，so that only a short time afterwards he got out of the arrest and changed his name．But at that hour I saw in his arrestation，the finger of God，for now there was nobody but me to take the wagons through the country．And in the early morning，while the old constellations of the stars were still out，we set off down the long endless Kijabe Hill，with the great plains of the Masai Reserve—iron-grey in the faint light of the dawn—spread at our feet，with lamps tied under the wagons，swinging，and with much shouting and cracking of whips．I had four wagons，with a full team of sixteen oxen to each，and five spare oxen，and with me twenty-one young Kikuyus and three Somalis：Farah，Ismail，the gun-bearer，and an old cook also named Ismail，a very noble old man．My dog Dusk walked by my side．

It was a pity that the police，when arresting Klapprott，had at the same time arrested his mule．I had not been able to recover it in all Kijabe so that for the first few days I had to walk in the dust beside the wagons．But later I bought a mule and saddle from a man whom I met in the Reserve，and again some time after a mule for Farah．

I was out then for three months．When we came down to our place of destination，we were sent off again to collect the stores of a big American shooting safari that had been camping near the border，and had left in a hurry at the news of the war．From there the wagons had to go to new places．I learned to know the fords and water-holes of the Masai Reserve，and to speak a little Masai．The roads everywhere were unbelievably bad，deep with dust，and barred with blocks of stone taller than the wagons；later we travelled mostly across the plains．The air of the African highlands went to my head like wine：I was all the time slightly drunk with it，and the joy of these months was indescribable．I had been out on a shooting safari before，but I had not till now been out alone with Africans．

The Somali and I，who felt responsible for the government's property，lived in constant fear of losing the oxen from lions．The lions were on the road，following after the big transports of supplies of sheep and provisions，which now continually were travelling along it to the border．In the early mornings，as we drove on，we could see，for a long way，the fresh spoor of the lions in the dust，upon the wagon-tracks of the road．At night，when the oxen were outspanned，there was always a risk of lions round the camp frightening them，and making them stampede and spread all over the country，where we would never find them again．So we built tall circular fences of thorn-trees round our outspanning and camping places，and sat up with rifles by the camp-fires．

Here both Farah and Ismail，and old Ismail himself，felt at such a safe distance from civilization that their tongues were loosened，and they would narrate strange happenings of Somaliland，or tales out of the Koran，and the Arabian Nights．Both Farah and Ismail had been to sea，for the Somali are a seafaring nation，and were，I believe，in old days，great pirates of the Red Sea．They explained to me how every live creature on the earth has got its replica at the bottom of the sea：horses，lions，women and giraffe，all live down there，and from time to time have been observed by sailors．They also recounted tales of horses which live at the bottom of the rivers of Somaliland，and at full-moon nights come up to the grassland to copulate with the Somali mares grazing there，and breed foals of wonderful beauty and swiftness．The vault of the nocturnal sky swung back over our heads as we sat on，new constellations of stars came up from the east．The smoke from the fire in the cold air carried long sparks with it，the fresh firewood smelt sour．From time to time the oxen suddenly all at once stirred，stamped and squeezed together，sniffing up in the air，so that old Ismail would climb on to the top of the loaded wagon，and there swing his lamp，to observe and to frighten off anything that might be about outside the fence．

We had many great adventures with lions：“Beware of Siawa，”said the Native leader of a transport going north，whom we met on the road．“Do not camp here．There are two hundred lions at Siawa．”So we tried to get past Siawa before nightfall，and hurried on，and as haste makes waste on a safari more than anything else，about sunset a wheel of the last wagon stuck on a big stone，and it could go no further．While I was now holding the lamp to the people working to lift it off，a lion took one of our spare oxen not three yards from me．By shouting and cracking whips，for my rifles were with the safari，we managed to frighten off the lion，and the ox，that had run away with the lion on his back，came back to us，but it had been badly mauled and died a couple of days later．

Many other strange things happened to us．At one time an ox drank up all our supply of paraffin，died on us，and left us without light of any kind until we got to an Indian dhuka in the Reserve，deserted by the owner，where strangely some of the goods were still untouched．

We were for a week camped close to a big camp of the Masai Morani，and the young warriors，in war-paint，with spears and long shields，and head-dresses of lion-skin，were round my tent day and night，to get news of the war and of the Germans．My own people of the safari liked this camp，because here they bought milk from the Morani's herd of cattle that trekked about with them and was herded by the young Masai boys，the Laioni，who as yet are too young to become warriors．The juvenile Masai soldier-girls，very lively and pretty，came into my tent to call on me．They would always ask for the loan of my hand mirror，and，when they held it up to one another，they bared their two rows of shining teeth to the mirror，like angry young carnivora．

All news of the movements of the enemy had to pass through Lord Delamere's camp．But Lord Delamere was moving all over the Reserve in such incredibly swift marches，that nobody ever knew where his camp was to be found．I had nothing to do with intelligence work，but I wondered how the system worked for the people employed in it．Once my way took me within a couple of miles of Lord Delamere's camp，and I rode over with Farah and had tea with him．The place，although he was to break camp next day，was like a city，swarming with Masai．For he was always very friendly with them，and in his camp they were so well regaled that it had become like the lion's den of the fable：all footsteps turning in and none out．A Masai runner，sent with a letter to Lord Delamere's camp，would never show himself again with an answer．Lord Delamere，in the centre of the stir，small，and exceedingly polite and courteous as ever，his white hair down on his shoulders，seemed eminently at ease here，told me everything about the war，and offered me tea with smoked milk in it，after the Masai fashion．

My people showed great forbearance with my ignorance of oxen，harness，and safari ways；they were indeed as keen to cover it up as I was myself．They worked well for me all through the safari，and never grumbled，although in my inexperience I asked more of everyone，both men and oxen，than could really be expected of them．They carried bath-water for me on their heads a long way across the plain，and when we outspanned at noon，they constructed a canopy against the sun，made out of spears and blankets，for me to rest under．They were a little scared of the wild Masai，and much disturbed by the idea of the Germans，of whom strange rumours went about．Under the circumstances I was to the expedition，I believe，a kind of guardian angel，or mascot．

Six months before the outbreak of the war，I had first come out to Africa，on the same boat as General von Lettow Vorbeck，who was now the highest in command of the German forces in East Africa．I did not know then that he was going to be a hero，and we had made friends on the journey．When we dined together in Mombasa，before he went farther on to Tanganyika，and I went up-country，he gave me a photograph of himself in uniform and on horseback，and wrote on it：

Das Paradies auf Erde

Ist auf dem Rüken der Pferde'，

Und die Gesundheit des Leibes

Am Busen des Weibes．



Farah，who had come to meet me in Aden，and who had seen the general and been aware that he was my friend，had taken the photograph with him on the safari and kept it with the money and the keys of the expedition to show the German soldiers if we were made prisoners，and he attached great value to it．

How beautiful were the evenings of the Masai Reserve when after sunset we arrived at the river or the water-hole where we were to outspan，travelling in a long file．The plains with the thorn-trees on them were already quite dark，but the air was filled with clarity—and over our heads，to the west，a single star which was to grow big and radiant in the course of the night was now just visible，like a silver point in the sky of citrine topaz．The air was cold to the lungs，the long grass dripping wet，and the herbs on it gave out their spiced astringent scent．In a little while on all sides the cicada would begin to sing．The grass was me，and the air，the distant invisible mountains were me，the tired oxen were me．I breathed with the slight night-wind in the thorn-trees．

After three months I was suddenly ordered home．As things began to be systematically organized and regular troops came out from Europe，my expedition，I believe，was found to be somewhat irregular．We went back，passing our old camping places with heavy hearts．

This safari lived for a long time in the memory of the farm．Later on I had many other safaris，but for some reason—either because we had at the time been in the service of the government，a sort of official ourselves，or because of the war-like atmosphere about it—this particular expedition was dear to the hearts of the people who had been on it．Those who had been with me came to look upon themselves as a safari aristocracy．

Many years afterwards they would come up to the house and talk about the safari，just to freshen up their memory of it，and to go through one or another of our adventures then．





The Swaheli Numeral System


At the time when I was new in Africa，a shy young Swedish dairyman was to teach me the numbers in Swaheli．As the Swaheli word for nine，to Swedish ears，has a dubious ring，he did not like to tell it to me，and when he had counted：“seven，eight，”he stopped，looked away，and said：“They have not got nine in Swaheli．”

“You mean，”I said，“that they can only count as far as eight？”

“Oh，no，”he said quickly．“They have got ten，eleven，twelve，and so on．But they have not got nine．”

“Does that work？”I asked，wondering．“What do they do when they come to nineteen？”

“They have not got nineteen either，”he said，blushing，but very firm，“nor ninety，nor nine hundred，”—for these words in Swaheli are constructed out of the number nine—“But apart from that they have got all our numbers．”

The idea of this system for a long time gave me much to think of，and for some reason a great pleasure．Here，I thought，was a people who have got originality of mind，and courage to break with the pedantry of the numeral series．

One，two，and three are the only three sequential prime numbers．I thought，so may eight and ten be the only sequential even numbers．People might try to prove the existence of the number of nine by arguing that it should be possible to multiply the number of three with itself．But why should it be so？If the number of two has got no square root，the number of three may just as well be without a square number．If you work out the sum of digits of a number until you reduce it to a single figure，it makes no difference to the results if you have got the number of nine，or any multiple of nine，in it from the beginning，so that here nine may really be said to be non-existent，and that，I thought，spoke for the Swaheli system．

It happened that I had at that time a houseboy，Zacharia，who had lost the fourth finger of his left hand．Perhaps，I thought，this is a common thing with Natives，and is done to facilitate their arithmetic to them，when they are counting upon their fingers．

When I began to develop my ideas to other people，I was stopped，and enlightened．Yet I have still got the feeling that there exists a native system of numeral characters without the number nine in it，which to them works well and by which you can find out many things．

I have，in this connection，remembered an old Danish clergyman who declared to me that he did not believe that God had created the eighteenth century．





“I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me．”


When in Africa in March the long rains begin after four months of hot，dry weather，the richness of growth and the freshness and fragrance everywhere are overwhelming．

But the farmer holds back his heart and dares not trust to the generosity of nature：he listens，dreading to hear a decrease in the roar of the falling rain．The water that the earth is now drinking in must bring the farm，with all the vegetable，animal and human life on it，through four rainless months to come．

It is a lovely sight when the roads of the farm have all been turned into streams of running water，and the farmer wades through the mud with a singing heart，out to the flowering and dripping coffee-fields．But it happens in the middle of the rainy season that in the evening the stars show themselves through the thinning clouds；then he stands outside his house and stares up，as if hanging himself on to the sky to milk down more rain．He cries to the sky：“Give me enough and more than enough．My heart is bared to thee now，and I will not let thee go except thou bless me．Drown me if you like，but kill me not with caprices．No coitus interruptus，heaven，heaven！”

Sometimes a cool，colourless day in the months after the rainy season calls back the time of the marka mbaya，the bad year，the time of the drought．In those days the Kikuyu used to graze their cows round my house，and a boy amongst them who had a flute，from time to time played a short tune on it．When I have heard this tune again，it has recalled in one single moment all our anguish and despair of the past．It has got the salt taste of tears in it．But at the same time I found in the tune，unexpectedly surprisingly，a vigour，a curious sweetness，a song．Had those hard times really had all these in them？There was youth in us then，a wild hope．It was during those long days that we were all of us merged into a unity，so that on another planet we shall recognise one another，and the things cry to each other，the cuckoo clock and my books to the lean fleshed cows on the lawn and the sorrowful old Kikuyus：“You also were there．You also were part of the Ngong farm．”That bad time blessed us and went away．

The friends of the farm came to the house，and went away again．They were not the kind of people who stay for a long time in the same place．They were not the kind of people either who grow old；they died and never came back．But they had sat contented by the fire，and when the house，closing round them，said：“I will not let you go except you bless me，”they laughed and blessed it，and it let them go．

An old lady sat in a party and talked of her life．She declared that she would like to live it all over again，and held this fact to prove that she had lived wisely．I thought：Yes，her life has been the sort of life that should really be taken twice before you can say that you have had it．An arietta you can take da capo，but not a whole piece of music—not a symphony and not a five act tragedy either．If it is taken over again it is because it has not gone as it ought to have gone．

My life，I will not let you go except you bless me，but then I will let you go．





The Eclipse of the Moon


One year we had an eclipse of the moon．A short time before it was to take place I had the following letter from the young Indian Stationmaster of kikuyu station：

HONOURED MADAM—I have been kindly instructed that the light of the sun is going to be put out for seven days running．Leave alone the railway trains，I beg you kindly inform me，as I believe that nobody else will kindly inform me，whether during this period I shall leave my cows to graze in the surroundings，or shall I collect them into the stable？—I have the honour to be，Madam，Your obedient servant，

Patel．





Natives and Verse


The Natives，who have a strong sense of rhythm，know nothing of verse，or at least did not know anything before the times of the schools，where they were taught hymns．One evening out in the maize field，where we had been harvesting maize，breaking off the cobs and throwing them on to the ox-carts，to amuse myself，I spoke to the field labourers，who were mostly quite young，in Swaheli verse．There was no sense in the verse，it was made for the sake of rhyme—“Ngumbe na-penda chumbe，Malaya mbaya．Wakamba na-kula mamba．”The oxen like salt—whores are bad—the Wakamba do eat snakes．It caught the interest of the boys，they formed a ring round me．They were quick to understand that the meaning of poetry is of no consequence，and they did not question the thesis of the verse，but waited eagerly for the rhyme，and laughed at it when it came．I tried to make them themselves find the rhyme and finish the poem when I had begun it，but they could not，or would not，do that，and turned away their heads．As they had become used to the idea of poetry，they begged：“Speak again．Speak like rain．”Why they should feel verse to be like rain I do not know．It must have been，however，an expression of applause，since in Africa rain is always longed for and welcomed．





Of the Millennium


At the time when the near return of Christ to the earth had become a certainty，a committee was formed to decide upon the arrangements for his reception．After some discussion，it sent out a circular which prohibited all waving and throwing about of palm-branches as well as all cries of“Hosanna”．

When the Millennium had been going on for some time，and joy was universal，Christ one evening said to Peter that he wanted，when everything was quiet，to go out for a short walk with him alone．

“Where do you want to go，my Lord？”Peter asked．

“I should like，”answered the Lord，“just to take a walk from the Praetorium，along that long road，up to the Hill of Calvary．”





Kitosch's Story


Kitosch's story has been in the papers．A case rose from it，and a jury was set to go through it from beginning to end，searching for enlightenment；some of the enlightenment will still be found in the old documents．

Kitosch was a young Native in the service of a young white settler of Molo．One Wednesday in June，the settler lent his brown mare to a friend，to ride to the station on．He sent Kitosch there to bring back the mare，and told him not to ride her，but to lead her．But Kitosch jumped on to the mare，and rode her back，and on Saturday the settler，his master，was told of the offence by a man who had seen it．In punishment the settler，on Sunday afternoon，had Kitosch flogged，and afterwards tied up in his store，and here late on Sunday night Kitosch died．

Upon the matter the High Court was set in Nakuru，in the Railway Institute，on the 1st of August．

The Natives who gathered and sat round the Railway Institute，will have been wondering what it was all about．To their mind the case was plain，for Kitosch had died，of that there was no doubt，and，according to Native ideas，a compensation for his death should now be made to his people．

But the idea of justice of Europe varies from that of Africa，and，to the jury of white men，the problem of guilt and innocence at once presented itself．The verdict in the case might be one of murder，or manslaughter，or of grievous hurt．The judge reminded the jury that the degree of an offence rests upon the intentions of the persons concerned，and not upon the results．What，then，had been the intentions，and the attitude of mind，of the persons concerned in the Kitosch case？

To decide upon the intention and attitude of mind of the settler，the court had him cross-examined for many hours a day．They were trying to make up a picture of what had happened，and brought in all the details that they could lay hands on．It is in this way written down that when the settler called Kitosch，he came，and stood three yards away．This insignificant detail in the report is of great effect．Here they are at the opening of the drama，the white and the black man，at three yards' distance．

But from now on，as the story advances，the balance of the picture is broken，and the figure of the settler is blurred and grows smaller．It cannot be helped．It becomes only an accessory figure in a great landscape，a pale puny face，it loses its weight，and looks like a figure cut out in paper，and it is blown about，as by a draught，by the unknown freedom to do what it likes．

The settler stated that he began by asking Kitosch who had given him permission to ride the brown mare，and that he repeated this question forty to fifty times；he admitted at the same time that nobody could possibly have given Kitosch any such permission．Here his perdition begins．In England he would not have been able to ask a question forty to fifty times，he would have been stopped，in one way or the other，long before the fortieth time．Here in Africa were people to whom he could shriek the same question fifty times over．In the end Kitosch answered that he was not a thief，and the settler stated that it was as a result of the insolence of the answer that he had the boy flogged．

At this point the report has got a second irrelevant，and effective，detail．It says that during the flogging，two Europeans，who are designated as friends of the settler，came over to see him．They looked on for ten minutes，or a quarter of an hour，and walked away．

After the flogging the settler could not let Kitosch go．

Late in the evening，he tied Kitosch with a rein，and locked him into his store．When the jury asked him why he did so，he gave an answer that he had no sense，he said that he wanted to keep such a boy from running about on the farm．After supper，he went back to the store，and found Kitosch lying unconscious a little way from where he had tied him up，with the reins loosened．He called in his Baganda cook，and with his assistance tied up the boy tighter than before，with his hands fastened to a post at his back，and with his right leg tied to a post in front．He left the store，locking the door，but half an hour later went back there，got hold of his cook and the kitchen-Toto，and let them into the store．Then he went to bed，and the next thing he remembered，he said，was that the Toto came from the store，and told him that Kitosch had died．

The jury kept in mind the words that the degree of an offence rests upon the intention，and looked for an intention．They went into a number of detailed questions about the flogging of Kitosch，and about what happened after，and as you read the papers you seem to see them shake their heads．

But what now had been the intention and the attitude of mind of Kitosch？This，when gone into，was found to be a different thing．Kitosch had had an intention，and in the end it came to weigh in the scales of the case．It can be said that by his intention，and his attitude of mind，the African，in his grave，saved the European．

Kitosch had not much opportunity for expressing his intention．He was locked up in the store，his message，therefore，comes very simply，and in a single gesture．The night-watch states that he cried all night．But it was not so，for at one o'clock he talked with the Toto，who was in the store with him．He indicated to the child that he must shout to him，because the flogging had made him deaf．But at one o'clock he asked the Toto to loosen his feet，and explained that in any case he could not run away．When the Toto had done as he asked him，Kitosch said to him that he wanted to die．At four，the child said，he again said that he wanted to die．A little while after，he rocked himself from side to side，cried：“I am dead！”and died．

Three doctors gave evidence in the case．

The district surgeon，who had done the post mortem examination，pronounced death to be due to the injuries and wounds that he had found on the body．He did not believe that any immediate medical attention could have saved Kitosch's life．

The two doctors from Nairobi，called in for the defence，were，however，of a different mind．

The flogging in itself，they held，was not sufficient to have caused death．An important factor came into the matter，not to be ignored：that was the will to die．On this point，the first doctor stated，he could speak with authority，for he had been in the country twenty-five years，and knew the Native mind．Many medical men could support him that the wish to die，in a Native，had actually caused death．In the present case the matter was particularly clear，for Kitosch had himself said that he wanted to die．The second doctor bore him up in this point of view．

It was very likely，the doctor now went on，that if Kitosch had not taken this attitude，he would not have died．If，for instance，he had eaten something，he might not have lost courage，for starvation is known to reduce courage．He added that the wound on the lip might not be due to a kick，but might be just a bite by the boy himself，in severe pain．

The doctor，furthermore，did not believe that Kitosch would have made up his mind to die till after nine o'clock，as by that time he seemed to have tried to escape．Neither had he died till after nine o'clock．When he had been caught in the attempt to escape，and had been tied up again，the fact of being a prisoner，the doctor said，might have weighed on his mind．

The two doctors from Nairobi summed up their view of the case．The death of Kitosch，they held，was due to the flogging，to starvation，and to the wish to die，the latter being the subject of special emphasis．The wish to die might，they considered，have been caused by the effects of the flogging．

After the doctors' evidence，the case turned upon what was called in court“The wish-to-die theory．”The district surgeon，who was the only one who had seen Kitosch's body，rejected the theory，and gave examples of cancer patients of his practice who had wished to die but all the same had not died．These people，however，were found to have been Europeans．

The jury in the end gave a verdict of Guilty of grievous hurt．The same verdict was applied to the Natives accused，but it was considered that as they had acted under the orders of their master，a European，it would be an injustice to imprison them．The judge imposed a sentence of two years R．I．on the settler，and of one day on each of the Natives．

It seems to you，as you read the case through，a strange，a humiliating fact that the Europeans should not，in Africa，have power to throw the African out of existence．The country is his native land，and whatever you do to him，when he goes he goes by his own free will，and because he does not want to stay．Who is to take the responsibility for what happens in a house？The man who owns it，who has inherited it．

By this strong sense in him of what is right and decorous，the figure of Kitosch，with his firm will to die，although now removed from us by many years，stands out with a beauty of its own．In it is embodied the fugitiveness of the wild things who are，in the hour of need，conscious of a refuge somewhere in existence；who go when they like；of whom we can never get hold．





Some African Birds


Just at the beginning of the long rains，in the last week of March，or the first week of April，I have heard the nightingale in the woods of Africa．Not the full song：a few notes only—the opening bars of the concerto，a rehearsal，suddenly stopped and again begun．It was as if，in the solitude of the dripping woods，someone was，in a tree，tuning a small cello．It was，however，the same melody，and the same abundance and sweetness，as were soon to fill the forests of Europe，from Sicily to Elsinore．

We had the black and white storks in Africa，the birds that build their nests upon the thatched village roofs of northern Europe．They look less imposing in Africa than they do there，for here they had such tall and ponderous birds as the marabout and the secretary bird to be compared to．The storks have got other habits in Africa than in Europe，where they live as in married couples and are symbols of domestic happiness．Here they are seen together in big flights，as in clubs．They are called locust birds in Africa，and follow along when the locusts come upon the land，living high on them．They fly over the plain，too，where there is a grass-fire on，circling just in front of the advancing line of small leaping flames，high up in the scintillating rainbow coloured air，and the grey smoke，on watch for the mice and snakes that ran from the fire．The storks have a gay time in Africa．But their real life is not here，and when the winds of spring bring back thoughts of mating and nesting，their hearts are turned towards the north，they remember old times and places and fly off，two and two，and are shortly after wading in the cold bogs of their birth places．

Out on the plains，in the beginning of the rains，where the vast stretches of burnt grass begin to show fresh green sprouting，there are many hundred plovers．The plains always have a maritime air，the open horizon recalls the sea and the long sea sands，the wandering wind is the same，the charred grass has a saline smell，and when the grass is long it runs in waves all over the land．When the white carnation flowers on the plains you remember the chopping white-specked waves all round you as you are tacking up the Sund．Out on the plains the plovers likewise take on the appearance of sea-birds，and behave like sea-birds on a beach，legging it，on the close grass，as fast as they can for a short time，and then rising before your horse with high shrill shrieks，so that the light sky is all alive with wings and birds' voices．

The crested cranes，which come on to the newly rolled and planted maize-land，to steal the maize out of the ground，make up for the robbery by being birds of good omen，announcing the rain；and also by dancing to us．When the tall birds are together in large numbers，it is a fine sight to see them spread their wings and dance．There is much style in the dance，and a little affectation，for why，when they can fly，do they jump up and down as if they were held on to the earth by magnetism？The whole ballet has a sacred look，like some ritual dance；perhaps the cranes are making an attempt to join heaven and earth like the winged angels walking up and down Jacob's Ladder．With their delicate pale grey colouring，the little black velvet skull-cap and the fan-shaped crown，the cranes have all the air of light，spirited frescoes．When，after the dance，they lift and go away，to keep up the sacred tone of the show they give out，by the wings or the voice，a clear ringing note，as if a group of church bells had taken to the wing and were sailing off．You can hear them a long way away，even after the birds themselves have become invisible in the sky：a chime from the clouds．

The greater hornbill was another visitor to the farm，and came there to eat the fruits of the Cape-Chestnut tree．They are very strange birds．It is an adventure or an experience to meet them，not altogether pleasant，for they look exceedingly knowing．One morning before sunrise I was woken up by a loud jabbering outside the house，and when I walked out on the terrace I saw forty-one hornbills sitting in the trees on the lawn．There they looked less like birds than like some fantastic articles of finery set on the trees here and there by a child．Black they all were，with the sweet，noble black of Africa，deep darkness absorbed through an age，like old soot，that makes you feel that for elegance，vigour，and vivacity no colour rivals black．All the hornbills were talking together in the merriest mood，but with choice deportment，like a party of inheritors after a funeral．The morning air was as clear as crystal，the sombre party was bathing in freshness and purity，and，behind the trees and the birds，the sun came up，a dull red ball．You wonder what sort of a day you are to get after such an early morning．

The flamingoes are the most delicately coloured of all the African birds，pink and red like a flying twig of an oleander bush．They have incredibly long legs and bizarre and recherché curves of their necks and bodies，as if from some exquisite traditional prudery they were making all attitudes and movements in life as difficult as possible．

I once travelled from Port Said to Marseilles in a French boat that had on board a consignment of a hundred and fifty flamingoes，which were going to the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Marseilles．They were kept in large dirty cases with canvas sides，ten in each，standing up close to one another．The keeper，who was taking the birds over，told me that he was counting on losing twenty per cent of them on a trip．They were not made for that sort of life；in rough weather they lost their balance，their legs broke，and the other birds in the cage trampled on them．At night when the wind was high in the Mediterranean and the ship came down in the waves with a thump，at each wave I heard，in the dark，the flamingoes shriek．Every morning，I saw the keeper taking out one or two dead birds，and throwing them overboard．The noble wader of the Nile，the sister of the lotus，which floats over the landscape like a stray cloud of sunset，had become a slack cluster of pink and red feathers with a pair of long，thin sticks attached to it．The dead birds floated on the water for a short time，knocking up and down in the wake of the ship before they sank．





Pania


The deerhounds，from having lived for innumerable generations with man，have acquired a human sense of humour，and can laugh．Their idea of a joke is that of the Natives，who are amused by things going wrong．Perhaps you cannot get above this class of humour，until you also get an art，and an established church．

Pania was Dusk's son．I walked with him one day near the pond，where there was a row of tall，thin blue-gum trees，when he ran away from me up to one of the trees and came back again half-way，to make me come with him．I went up to the tree，and saw a serval-cat sitting high up in it．The serval-cats take your chickens，so that I shouted to a Toto walking by，and sent him up to the house for my gun，and when I had it brought，I shot the serval-cat．She came down from her great height with a thump，and Pania was upon her in a second，shaking her and pulling her about，very pleased with the performance．

Some time after I again came by the same road，past the pond；I had been out to shoot partridge，but had got none，and both Pania and I were downcast．All at once Pania flew up to the farthest tree of the row，barking round it in a state of the highest excitement，then rushed back to me，and again back to the tree．I was pleased that I had got my gun with me，and at the prospect of a second serval-cat，for they have got pretty，spotted skins，I ran up to the tree．But，when I looked up，there was a black domestic cat sitting，very angry，as high up as possible in the swaying top of the tree．I lowered my gun．“Pania，”I said，“you fool！It's a cat．”

As I turned round to Pania，he stood at a little distance，looking at me and splitting his sides with laughter．When his eyes met mine he rushed up to me，danced，wagged his tail，whined，put his feet on my shoulders，and his nose to my face，then jumped back again to give free course to his laughter．

He expressed by pantomime：“I know．I know．It was a tame cat．I knew all the time．Indeed，you must excuse me．But if you only knew the figure you cut，rushing up to a tame cat with a gun！”

All that day，from time to time，he went through the same agitation of mind，and the same behaviour，expressing the most overwhelmingly friendly feelings towards me，and then withdrawing a little to have an unhindered laugh．

An insinuating note came into his friendliness．“You know，”he said，“that in this house it is only you and Farah that I ever laugh at．”

Even in the evening when he was asleep，in front of the fire，I heard him in his sleep groaning and whimpering a little with laughter．I believe that he remembered the event a long time after，when we passed the pond and the trees．





Esa's Death


Esa，who was taken away from me during the war，after the armistice came back and lived on the farm peacefully．He had a wife by the name of Mariammo，a thin，black，hard-working woman，who carried firewood to the house．Esa was the gentlest servant I ever had，and quarrelled with nobody．

But something had happened to Esa in his exile，and he had come back changed．Sometimes I was afraid that he might imperceptibly die on me，like a plant that has had its roots cut through．

Esa was my cook，but he did not like to cook，he wanted to be a gardener．Plants were the only things for which he had preserved a real live interest．But while I had another gardener I had no other cook，and so held back Esa in the kitchen．I had promised him that he should go back to his garden-work，but I kept him off from month to month．Esa on his own had dammed in a bit of ground by the river，and planted it as a surprise to me．But as he had been alone at it，and was not a strong man，the dam was not solid enough，and in the long rains it went away altogether．

The first disturbance of his quiet non-existence came upon Esa when his brother died in the Kikuyu Reserve and left him a black cow．By then it became evident how much Esa had been sucked out by life，he could no longer stand up to any strong manifestation of it．In particular，I believe，he could not quite stand happiness．He asked me for three days' leave to go and fetch the cow and，on his return I saw that he had been stirred and harassed，like the hands and feet of people who have been benumbed by cold，and brought into a warm room．

All Natives are gamblers，and under the illusion，created by the black cow，that from now fortune was going to smile on him，Esa began to develop a terrible confidence in things；he had great dreams．He felt that life was before him still；he decided to take a new wife．When he told me of his plan，he was already negotiating with his future father-in-law，who lived on the Nairobi road，and had a Swaheli wife．I tried to make him change his mind．“You have got a very good wife，”I said to him，“and your head is already grey，you cannot be needing another．Stay with us now and live in peace．”Esa took no offence at my arguments，the little gentle Kikuyu stood up erect before me，and in his vague way stuck to his decision．Shortly after，he brought his new wife，Fatoma，to the farm．

That Esa should ever hope for any good to come from his new marriage showed that he had lost his judgment．The bride was very young，hard，and sulky，dressed in the Swaheli fashion，with the lasciviousness of her mother's nation，but with no gracefulness or gaiety in her．But Esa's face was radiant with triumph，and great plans；he was behaving，in his innocence，like a man on the verge of general paralysis．Mariammo，the patient slave，kept in the background，and seemed unconcerned．

It is possible that Esa had now a short time of greatness and rejoicement，but it did not last，and his peaceful existence on the farm went to pieces through his new wife．A month after the wedding she ran away from him，to live with the Native soldiers in the barracks of Nairobi．For a long time Esa used to ask for a day's leave to go into town and fetch her back，and in the evening returned with the dark，reluctant girl．The first time he went confidently and very decided；he would get her—what about it，was she not his lawful wife？Later he walked off in a bewildered，sad re-search of his dreams and the smile of fortune．

“What do you want her back for，Esa？”I said to him．“Let her go．She does not want to come back to you，and no good will come from this．”

But Esa had not got it in him to let her go．Towards the end he came down in his expectations of life，and it was simply the monetary value of his woman that he sought to retain．The other boys laughed at him，when he trudged off，and told me that the soldiers laughed at him，too．But Esa had never paid much attention to what other people thought of him，and in any case he was past it now．He went in persistently and faithfully to recover his lost property，as a man will go in search of a runaway cow．

One morning Fatoma informed my houseboys that Esa was sick，and could not cook that day，but he would be up next day，she said．But late in the afternoon the boys came in and told me that Fatoma had disappeared，and that Esa had been poisoned and was dying．When I came out，they had carried him，on his bed，out in the square between the boys' huts．It was obvious that he had not got long to live．He had been given some sort of Native poison，similar to strychnine，and must have suffered terribly in his hut，under the eyes of the murderous young wife，until she felt that she had safely finished him，and had made off．He still had a few spasms that contracted his body，but he was all rigid and cold，like a dead man．His face was much changed，and froth，mixed with blood，ran out from the corners of his pale-blue mouth．Farah had gone to Nairobi in the car，so that I could not get Esa in to the hospital，but I do not think that I should have done that in any case；there was no help for him．

Before he died Esa looked at me for a long time，but I do not know if he recognized me．With the consciousness in his dark，animal-like eyes now went the remembrance of the country such as I had always wished to have known it，when it had been like a Noah's Ark，with the game all round the little Native boy herding his father's goats on the plain．I held his hand，a human hand，a strong ingenious tool，which had held weapons，planted vegetables and flowers，caressed；which I had taught to make omelettes．Would Esa himself hold his life to have been a success or a failure？It would have been difficult to tell．He had gone along his own little，slow，twined paths and had been through many things，always a peaceful man．

When Farah came home he took much trouble to have Esa buried with the full orthodox ceremonial，for he had been a pious Mohammedan．The priest，whom we called out from Nairobi，could not come till next evening，so that Esa's funeral took place at night，with the Milky Way on the sky，and lamps in the funeral procession．His grave was walled up，in the Mohammedan way，under a big tree in the forest．Mariammo now came forward and took her place amongst the mourners，and bewailed Esa loudly in the night air．

Farah and I held a council as to what we ought to do about Fatoma，and we decided to do nothing．It evidently went against Farah to take steps to have a woman punished by the law．I gathered from him that the Mohammedan law does not hold a woman to account．Her husband is responsible for what she does，and must pay the fine for what misfortunes she causes，as he must pay the fine for what damage his horse may do．But if the horse throws the owner and kills him？Well yes，Farah agrees，that is a sad accident．After all，Fatoma herself had had reason to complain about her fate，now she would be left to fulfil it as she chose to，in the barracks of Nairobi．





Of Natives and History


The people who expect the Natives to jump joyfully from the stone age to the age of the motor cars，forget the toil and labour which our own fathers have had，to bring us all through history up to where we are．

We can make motor cars and aeroplanes，and teach the Natives to use them．But the true love of motor cars cannot be made，in human hearts，in the turn of a hand．It takes centuries to produce it，and it is likely that Socrates，the Crusades，and the French Revolution，have been needed in the making．We of the present day，who love our machines，cannot quite imagine how people in the old days could live without them．But we could not make the Athanasian Creed，or the technique of the Mass，or of a five-act tragedy，and perhaps not even of a sonnet．And if we had not found them there ready for our use，we should have had to do without them．Still we must imagine，since they have been made at all，that there was a time when the hearts of humanity cried out for these things，and when a deeply felt want was relieved when they were made．

Father Bernard came over on his motor bicycle one day，his bearded face all beaming with bliss and triumph，to lunch with me，and to bring me tidings of great joy．The day before，he told me，nine young Kikuyu，from the Church of Scotland Mission，had come and asked to be received into the Roman Catholic Church，because they had，upon meditation and discussions，come to hold with the doctrine of the Transubstantiation，of that church．

All the people whom I told of this happening，laughed at Father Bernard，and explained that the young Kikuyus had seen a chance of higher wages，or lighter work，or of getting a bicycle to ride on，at the French Mission，and had therefore invented their conversion in regard to the Transubstantiation．For we ourselves，they said，cannot understand it，and we do not even like to think about it，so that to the Kikuyu it must be altogether inadmissible．But it is not quite sure that it is so；Father Bernard knew the Kikuyus well．The minds of the young Kikuyu may now be walking on the shadowy paths of our own ancestors，whom we should not disown in their eyes，who held their ideas about the Transubstantiation very dear．Those people of five hundred years ago，were in their day offered higher wages，and promotion，and easier terms of life，even sometimes their very lives，and to everything they preferred their conviction about the Transubstantiation．They were not offered a bicycle，but Father Bernard himself，who had got a motor bicycle，attached less value to it than to the conversion of the nine Kikuyus．

The modern white people in Africa believe in evolution and not in any sudden creative act．They might then run the Natives through a short practical lesson of history to bring them up to where we are．We took these nations over not quite forty years ago；if we compare that moment to the moment of the birth of the Lord，and allow them to catch up with us，three years to our hundred，it will now be time to send them out Saint Francis of Assisi，and in a few years Rabelais．They would love and appreciate both better than we do，of our century．They liked Aristophanes when some years ago I tried to translate to them the dialogue between the farmer and his son，out of“The Clouds”．In twenty years they might be ready for the Encyclopaedists，and then they would come，in another ten years，to Kipling．We should let them have dreamers，philosophers，and poets out，to prepare the ground for Mr．Ford．

Where shall they find us then？Shall we in the meantime have caught them by the tail and be hanging on to it，in our pursuit of some shade，some darkness，practising upon a tomtom？Will they be able to have our motor cars at cost price then，as they can now have the doctrine of the Transubstantiation？





The Earthquake


One year，about Christmas，we had an earthquake；it was strong enough to turn over a number of native huts，it was probably of the power of an angry elephant．It came in three shocks，each of them lasted a few seconds，and there was a pause of a few seconds in between them．These intervals gave people time to form their ideas of the happening．

Denys Finch-Hatton，who was at the time camped in the Masai Reserve，and was sleeping in his lorry，told me when he came back，that as he was woken up by the shock he thought，“A rhino has got underneath the lorry．”I myself was in my bedroom going to bed when the earthquake came．At the first tug I thought，“A leopard has got up on the roof．”When the second shock came，I thought，“I am going to die，this is how it feels to die．”But in the short stillness between the second and the third shock，I realized what it was，it was an earthquake，and I had never thought that I should live to see that．For a moment now I believed that the earthquake was over．But when the third and last shock of it came，it brought with it such an overwhelming feeling of joy that I do not remember ever in my life to have been more suddenly and thoroughly transported．

The heavenly bodies，in their courses，have it in their power to move human minds to unknown heights of delight．We are not generally conscious of them；when their idea is suddenly brought back，and actualized to us，it opens up a tremendous perspective．Kepler writes of what he felt when，after many years' work，he at last found the laws of the movements of the planets：

“I give myself over to my rapture．The die is cast．Nothing I have ever felt before is like this．I tremble，my blood leaps．God has waited six thousand years for a looker-on to his work．His wisdom is infinite，that of which we are ignorant is contained in him，as well as the little that we know．”

Indeed it was exactly the same transport which took hold of me and shook me all through，at the time of the earthquake．

The feeling of colossal pleasure lies chiefly in the consciousness that something which you have reckoned to be immovable，has got it in it to move on its own．That is probably one of the strongest sensations of joy and hope the world．The dull globe，the dead mass，the earth itself，rose and stretched under me．It sent me out a message，the slightest touch，but of unbounded significance．It laughed so that the Native huts fell down and cried：Eppur si muove．

Early next morning，Juma brought me my tea and said：“The King of England is dead．”

I asked him how he knew．

“Did you not，Memsahib，”he said，“feel the earth toss and shake last night？That means that the King of England is dead．”

But luckily the King of England lived for many years after the earthquake．





George


On a cargo-boat to Africa I once made friends with a little boy named George，who was travelling out with his mother and his young aunt．One day，on the deck，he detached himself from his women and，followed by their eyes，walked up to me．He announced that it was his birthday next day，he would be six years old，and his mother was going to ask the English passengers for tea，would I come？he said．

“But I am not English，George，”said I．

“What are you？”he asked，in great surprise．

“I am a Hottentot，”I said．

He stood up straight，and looked at me very gravely．

“Never mind，”he said，“I hope you will come．”

He walked back to his mother and aunt and announced to them in a nonchalant way，but with so much firmness that it cut short any objection：“She is a Hottentot．But I want her．”





Kejiko


I once had a fat riding-mule that I had named Molly．The mule-sice gave her another name，he called her Kejiko，which means“the spoon，”and when I asked him why he called her the spoon，he answered：“Because she looks like a spoon．”I walked all round her to find out what he had in his mind，but to me she did not look，from any side，the least like a spoon．

Some time after I happened to be driving Kejiko，with three other mules，in a cart．When I got up in the driver's high seat，I had a kind of bird's eye view of the mules．Then I saw that the sice had been right．Kejiko was unusually narrow across the shoulder and had broad plump hindquarters，she looked very much like a spoon with the rounded side up．

If Kamau the sice and I myself had each been painting a portrait of Kejiko，the pictures would have been as different as possible．But God and the angels would have seen her as Kamau saw her．He that cometh from above is above all，and what he hath seen that he testifieth．





The Giraffes go to Hamburg


I was staying in Mombasa in the house of Sheik Ali bin Salim，the Lewali of the coast，a hospitable，chivalrous old Arab gentleman．

Mombasa has all the look of a picture of paradise，painted by a small child．The deep sea-arm round the island forms an ideal harbour；the land is made out of whitish coral-cliff grown with broad green mango trees and fantastic bald grey baobab trees．The sea at Mombasa is as blue as a cornflower，and，outside the inlet to the harbour，the long breakers of the Indian Ocean draw a thin crooked white line and give out a low thunder even in the calmest weather．The narrow-streeted town of Mombasa is all built from coral-rock，in pretty shades of buff，rose，and ochre，and above the town rises the massive old fortress，with walls and embrasure，where three hundred years ago the Portuguese and the Arabs held out against one another；it displays stronger colours than the town，as if it had，in the course of the ages，from its high site drunk in more than one stormy sunset．

The flamboyant red acacia flowers in the gardens of Mombasa，unbelievably intense of colour and delicate of leaf．The sun burns and scorches Mombasa；the air is salt here，the breeze brings in every day fresh supplies of brine from the east，and the soil itself is salted so that very little grass grows，and the ground is bare like a dancing-floor．But the ancient mango trees have a dense dark-green foliage and give benignant shade；they create a circular pool of black coolness underneath them．More than any other tree that I know of，they suggest a place to meet in，a centre for human intercourse；they are as sociable as the village-wells．Big markets are held under the mango trees，and the ground round their trunks is covered with hen-coops，and piled up water-melons．

Ali bin Salim had a pleasant white house on the mainland，at the curve of the sea-arm，with a long row of stone steps down to the sea．There were guests' houses alongside it，and in the big room of the principal building，behind the verandah there were collected many fine Arab and English things：old ivory and brass，china from Lamu，velvet armchairs，photographs，and a large gramophone．Amongst these，inside a satin-lined casket，were the remnants of a fulltea-set in dainty English china of the forties，which had been the wedding-present of the young Queen of England and her consort，when the Sultan of Zanzibar's son married the Shah of Persia's daughter．The Queen and the Prince had wished the married couple such happiness as they were themselves enjoying．

“And were they as happy？”I asked Sheik Ali when he took out the little cups，one by one，and placed them on the table to show them to me．

“Alas no，”said he，“the bride would not give up riding．She had brought her horses with her，on the dhow that carried her trousseau．But the people of Zanzibar did not approve of ladies riding．There was much trouble about it，and，as the Princess would sooner give up her husband than her horses，in the end the marriage was dissolved and the Shah's daughter went back to Persia．”

In the harbour of Mombasa lay a rusty German cargo-steamer，homeward bound．I passed her in Ali bin Salim's rowing boat with his Swaheli rowers，on my way to the island and back．Upon the deck there stood a tall wooden case，and above the edge of the case rose the heads of two giraffes．They were，Farah，who had been on board the boat，told me，coming from Portuguese East Africa，and were going to Hamburg，to a travelling menagerie．

The giraffes turned their delicate heads from the one side to the other，as if they were surprised，which they might well be．They had not seen the sea before．They could only just have room to stand in the narrow case．The world had suddenly shrunk，changed and closed round them．

They could not know or imagine the degradation to which they were sailing．For they were proud and innocent creatures，gentle amblers of the great plains；they had not the least knowledge of captivity，cold，stench，smoke，and mange，nor of the terrible boredom in a world in which nothing is ever happening．

Crowds，in dark smelly clothes，will be coming in from the wind and sleet of the streets to gaze on the giraffes，and to realize man's superiority over the dumb world．They will point and laugh at the long slim necks when the graceful，patient，smoky-eyed heads are raised over the railings of the menagerie；they look much too long in there．The children will be frightened at the sight and cry，or they will fall in love with the giraffes，and hand them bread．Then the fathers and mothers will think the giraffes nice beasts，and believe that they are giving them a good time．

In the long years before them，will the giraffes sometimes dream of their lost country？Where are they now，where have they gone to，the grass and the thorn-trees，the rivers and water-holes and the blue mountains？The high sweet air over the plains has lifted and withdrawn．Where have the other giraffes gone to，that were side by side with them when they set going，and cantered over the undulating land？They have left them，they have all gone，and it seems that they are never coming back．

In the night where is the full moon？

The giraffes stir，and wake up in the caravan of the menagerie，in their narrow box that smells of rotten straw and beer．

Good-bye，good-bye，I wish for you that you may die on the journey，both of you，so that not one of the little noble heads，that are now raised，surprised，over the edge of the case，against the blue sky of Mombasa，shall be left to turn from one side to the other，all alone，in Hamburg，where no one knows of Africa．

As to us，we shall have to find someone badly transgressing against us，before we can in decency ask the giraffes to forgive us our transgressions against them．





In the Menagerie


About a hundred years ago，a Danish traveller to Hamburg，Count Schimmelmann，happened to come upon a small itinerant menagerie，and to take a fancy to it．While he was in Hamburg，he every day set his way round the place，although he would have found it difficult to explain what was to him the real attraction of the dirty and dilapidated caravans．The truth was that the menagerie responded to something within his own mind．It was winter and bitterly cold outside．In the sheds the keeper had been heating the old stove until it was a clear pink in the brown darkness of the corridor，alongside the animals' cages，but still the draught and the raw air pierced people to the bone．

Count Schimmelmann was sunk in contemplation of the hyena，when the proprietor of the menagerie came and addressed him．The proprietor was a small pale man with a fallen-in nose，who had in his days been a student of theology，but who had had to leave the faculty after a scandal，and had since step by step come down in the world．

“Your excellency does well to look at the hyena，”said he．“It is a great thing to have got a hyena to hamburg，where there has never been one till now．All hyenas，you will know，are hermaphrodites，and in Africa，where they come from，on a full-moon night they will meet and join in a ring of copulation wherein each individual takes the double part of male and female．Did you know that？”

“No，”said Count Schimmelmann with a slight movement of disgust．

“Do you consider now，your Excellency，”said the showman，“that it should be，on account of this fact，harder to a hyena than to other animals to be shut up by itself in a cage？Would he feel a double want，or is he，because he unites in himself the complementary qualities of creation，satisfied in himself，and in harmony？In other words，since we are all prisoners in life，are we happier，or more miserable，the more talents we possess？”

“It is a curious thing，”said Count Schimmelmann，who had been following his own thoughts and had not paid attention to the showman，“to realize that so many hundred，indeed thousands of hyenas should have lived and died，in order that we should，in the end，get this one specimen here，so that people in Hamburg shall be able to know what a hyena is like，and the naturalists to study from them．”

They moved on to look at the giraffes in the neighbouring cage．

“The wild animals，”continued the Count，“which run in a wild landscape，do not really exist．This one，now，exists，we have got a name for it，we know what it is like．The others might as well not have been，still they are the large majority．Nature is extravagant．”

The showman pushed back his worn fur cap；underneath it he himself had not got a hair on his head．“They see one another，”he said．

“Even that may be disputed，”said Count Schimmelmann after a short pause．“These giraffes，for instance，have got square markings on the skin．The giraffes，looking at one another，will not know a square and will consequently not see a square．can they be said to have seen one another at all？”

The showman looked at the giraffe for some time and then said：“God sees them．”

Count Schimmelmann smiled．“The giraffes？”he asked．

“Oh yes，your Excellency，”said the showman，“God sees the giraffes．While they have been running about and have played in Africa，God has been watching them and has taken a pleasure in their demeanour．He has made them to please him．It is in the Bible，your Excellency，”said the showman．“God so loved the giraffe that he created them．God has himself invented the square as well as the circle，surely your Excellency cannot deny that he has seen the squares on their skin and everything else about them．The wild animals，your Excellency，are perhaps a proof of the existence of God．But when they go to Hamburg，”he concluded，putting on his cap，“the argument becomes problematic．”

Count Schimmelmann who had arranged his life according to the ideas of other people，walked on in silence to look at the snakes，close to the stove．The showman，to amuse him，opened the case in which he kept them，and tried to make the snake within it wake up；in the end，the reptile slowly and sleepily wound itself round his arm．Count Schimmelmann looked at the group．

“Indeed，my good Kannegieter，”he said with a little surly laugh，“if you were in my service，or if I were king and you my minister，you would now have your dismissal．”

The showman looked up at him nervously．“Indeed，sir，should I？”he said，and slipped down the snake into the case．“And why，sir？If I may ask so，”he added after a moment．

“Ah，Kannegieter，you are not so simple as you make out，”said the Count．“Why？Because，my friend，the aversion to snakes is a sound human instinct，the people who have got it have kept alive．The snake is the deadliest of all the enemies of men，but what，except our own instinct of good and evil，is there to tell us so？The claws of the lions，the size and the tusks of the elephants，the horns of the buffaloes，all jump to the eye．But the snakes are beautiful animals．The snakes are round and smooth，like the things we cherish in life，of exquisite soft colouring，gentle in all their movements．Only to the godly man this beauty and gracefulness are in themselves loathsome，they smell from perdition，and remind him of the fall of man．Something within him makes him run away from the snake as from the devil，and that is what is called the voice of conscience．The man who can caress a snake can do anything．”Count Schimmelmann laughed a little at his own course of thoughts，buttoned his rich fur coat，and turned to leave the shed．

The showman had stood for a little while in deep thoughts．“Your Excellency，”he said at last，“you must needs love snakes．There is no way round it．Out of my own experience in life，I can tell you so，and indeed it is the best advice that I can give you：You should love the snakes．Keep in your mind，your Excellency，how often—keep in mind，your Excellency，that nearly every time that we ask the Lord for a fish，he will give us a serpent．”





Fellow-Travellers


At the table on the boat to Africa I sat between a Belgian going to the Congo，and an Englishman who had been eleven times to Mexico to shoot a particular kind of wild mountain-sheep，and who was now going out to shoot bongo．In making conversation on both sides，I got mixed up in the languages，and when I meant to ask the Belgian if he had travelled much in his life，I asked him：Avez-vous beaucoup travaillé dans votre vie？He took no offence but，drawing out his tooth-pick，he answered gravely：Enormément，Madame．From this time he made it his object to tell me of all the labours of his life．In everything that he discussed，a certain expression came back：Notre mission．Notre grande mission dans le Congo．

One evening，as we were going to play cards，the English traveller told us about Mexico and of how a very old Spanish lady，who lived on a lonely farm in the mountains，when she heard of the arrival of a stranger，had sent for him and ordered him to give her the news of the world．“Well，men fly now，Madame，”he said to her．

“Yes，I have heard of that，”said she，“and I have had many arguments with my priest about it．Now you can enlighten us，sir．Do men fly with their legs drawn up under them，like the sparrows，or stretched out behind them，like the storks？”

He also，in the course of our talk，made a remark about the ignorance of the Natives of Mexico，and of the schools there．The Belgian，who was dealing，paused with the last card in his hand，looked piercingly at the Englishman，and said：Il faut enseigner aux nègres à être honnêtes et à travailler．Rien de plus．Laying down the card with a bang on the table，he repeated with great determination：Rien de plus．Rien．Rien．Rien．





The Naturalist and the Monkeys


A Swedish Professor of Natural History came out to the farm to ask me to intervene for him with the Game Department．He had come to Africa，he told me，to find out at what phase of the embryo state the foot of the monkeys，that has got a thumb to it，begins to diverge from the human foot．For this purpose he meant to go and shoot Colobus monkeys on Mount Elgon．

“You will never find out from the Colobus monkeys，”I said to him．“They live in the tops of the cedar trees，and are shy and difficult to shoot．It would be the greatest luck should you get the embryo you want．”

The Professor was hopeful，he was going to stay out till he had got his foot，he said，even if it was to be for years．He had applied to the Game Department for permission to shoot the monkeys he wanted．The permission he was，in view of the high scientific object of his expedition，certain to get，but so far he had had no reply．

“How many monkeys have you asked to be allowed to shoot？”I asked him．

He told me that he had，to begin with，asked for permission to shoot fifteen hundred monkeys．

Now I knew the people at the Game Department，and I assisted him to send in a second letter，asking for a reply by return of post，since the Professor was keen to get off on his research．The answer from the Game Department did，for once，come by return of post．The Game Department，they wrote，were pleased to inform Professor Landgreen that，in view of the scientific object of his expedition，they had seen their way to make an exception from their rules，and to raise the number of monkeys on his license from four to six．

I had to read the letter over twice to the Professor．When the contents at last were clear to him，he became so downcast，so deadly shocked and hurt，that he did not say a single word．To my expressions of condolence he made no reply，but walked out of the house，got into his car and drove away sadly．

When things did not go so much against him，the Professor was an entertaining talker，and a humorist．In the course of our debates about the monkeys he enlightened me upon various facts and developed many of his ideas to me．One day he said：“I will tell you of a highly interesting experience of mine．Up at Mount Elgon，I found it possible to believe for a moment in the existence of God，what do you think of that？”

I said that it was interesting，but I thought：There is another interesting question which is—Has it been possible to God，at Mount Elgon，to believe for a moment in the existence of Professor Landgreen？





Karomenya


There was on the farm a little boy of nine named Karomenya who was deaf and dumb．He could give out a sound，a sort of short，raw roar，but it was very rare and he did not like it himself，but always stopped it at once，panting a few times．The other children were afraid of him and complained that he beat them．I first made Karomenya's acquaintance when his playfellows had knocked him on the head with the branch of a tree，so that his right cheek was thick，and festering with splinters that had to be dug out with a needle．This was not such a martyrdom to Karomenya as one would have thought；if it did hurt him，it also brought him into contact with people．

Karomenya was very dark，with fine moist black eyes and thick eyelashes；he had an earnest grave expression and hardly ever a smile on his face，and altogether much of the look of a small black Native bull-calf．He was an active，positive creature，and as he was cut off from communicating with the world by speech，fighting to him had become the manifestation of his being．He was also very good at throwing stones，and could place them where he wanted with great accuracy．At one time Karomenya had a bow and arrow，but it did not work well with him，as if an ear for the ring of the bow-string were，by necessity，part of the archer's craft．Karomenya was sturdily built and very strong for his age．He would probably not have exchanged these advantages over the other boys for their faculty of speech and hearing，for which，I felt，he had no particular admiration．

Karomenya，in spite of his fighting spirit，was no unfriendly person．If he realized that you were addressing him，his face at once lightened up，not in a smile but in a prompt resolute alacrity．Karomenya was a thief，and took sugar and cigarettes when he saw his chance，but he immediately gave away the stolen goods to the other children．I once came upon him as he was dealing out sugar to a circle of boys，himself in the centre；he did not see me，and that is the only time when I have seen him come near to laughing．

I tried，for a time，to give Karomenya a job in the kitchen or in the house but he failed in the offices，and was himself，after a while，bored with the work．What he liked，was to move heavy things about，and to drag them from one place to another．I had a row of white-washed stones along my drive，and，with his assistance，I one day moved one of them and rolled it all the way up to the house，to make the drive symmetrical．The next day，while I was out，Karomenya had taken up all the stones and had rolled them up to the house in a great heap，and I could never have believed that a person of his size would have been capable of that．It must have cost him a terrible effort．It was as if Karomenya knew his place in the world and stuck to it．He was deaf and dumb，but he was very strong．

Karomenya，most of all things in the world，wanted a knife，but I dared not give him one，for I thought that he might easily，in his striving for contact with other people，have killed one or more of the other children on the farm with it．He will have got one，though，later in life；his desire was so vehement，and God knows what use he has made of it．

The deepest impression I made on Karomenya was when I gave him a whistle．I had myself used it for some time to call in the dogs．When I showed it to him he took very little interest in it；then，as on my instruction he put it to his mouth and blew it，and the dogs，from both sides，came rushing at him，it gave him a great shock，his face darkened with surprise．He tried it once more，found the effect to be the same，and looked at me，a severe bright glance．When he got more used to the whistle，he wanted to know how it worked．He did not，to this purpose，look at the whistle itself，but when he had whistled for the dogs and they came，he scrutinized them with knit brows as if to find out where they had been hit．After this time Karomenya took a great liking to the dogs，and often，so to say，had the loan of them，taking them out for a walk．I used，when he walked off with them on a lead，to point to the place in the western sky where the sun should be standing by the time that he must be back，and he pointed to the same place，and was always very punctual．

One day，as I was out riding，I saw Karomenya and the dogs a long way away from my house，in the Masai Reserve．He did not see me，but thought that he was all on his own and unobserved．Here he let the dogs have a run，and then whistled them in，and he repeated the performance three or four times，while I watched him from my horse．Out on the plain，where he thought that nobody knew，he gave himself up to a new idea and aspect of life．

He carried his whistle on a string round his neck，but one day he had not got it．I asked him by pantomime what had become of it，and he answered by pantomime that it was gone—lost．He never asked me for another whistle．Either he thought that a second whistle was not to be had，or else he meant，now，to keep away altogether from something in life that was not really his affair．I am not even sure that he had not thrown away the whistle himself，unable to reconcile it with his other ideas of existence．

In five or six years，Karomenya is either to go through much suffering，or he will suddenly be lifted into heaven．





Pooran Singh


Pooran Singh's little blacksmith's shop down by the mill was a miniature hell on the farm，with all the orthodox attributes of that place．It was built of corrugated iron，and when the sun shone down upon the roof of it，and the flames of the furnace rose inside it，the air itself，in and around the hut，was white hot．All day long，the place resounded with the deafening noise of the forge—iron on iron，on iron once more—and the hut was filled with axes，and broken wheels，that made it look like some ancient gruesome picture of a place of execution．

All the same the blacksmith's shop had a great power of attraction，and when I went down to watch Pooran Singh at work I always found people in it and round it．Pooran Singh worked at a superhuman pace，as if his life depended upon getting the particular job of work finished within the next five minutes，he jumped straight up in the air over the forge，he shrieked out his orders to his two young Kikuyu assistants in a high bird's voice and behaved altogether like a man who is himself being burnt at the stake，or like some chafed over-devil at work．But Pooran Singh was no devil，but a person of the meekest disposition；out of working hours he had a little maidenly affectation of manner．He was our fundeed of the farm，which means an artisan of all work，carpenter，saddler and cabinet-maker，as well as blacksmith；he constructed and built more than one wagon for the farm，all on his own．But he liked the work of the forge best，and it was a very fine，proud sight，to watch him tiring a wheel．

Pooran Singh，in his appearance，was something of a fraud．When fully dressed，in his coat and large folded white turban，he managed，with his big black beard，to look a portly，ponderous man．But by the forge，bared to the waist，he was incredibly slight and nimble，with the Indian hour-glass torso．

I liked Pooran Singh's forge，and it was popular with the Kikuyus，for two reasons．

First，because of the iron itself，which is the most fascinating of all raw materials，and sets people's imagination travelling on long tracks．The plough，the sword and cannon and the wheel—the civilization of man—man's conquest of Nature in a nutshell—plain enough to be understood or guessed by the primitive people—and Pooran Singh hammered the iron．

Secondly，the Native world was drawn to the forge by its song．The treble，sprightly，monotonous，and surprising rhythm of the blacksmith's work has a mythical force．It is so virile that it appals and melts the women's hearts，it is straight and unaffected and tells the truth and nothing but the truth．Sometimes it is very outspoken．It has an excess of strength and is gay as well as strong，it is obliging to you and does great things for you，willingly，as in play．The Natives，who love rhythm，collected by Pooran Singh's hut and felt at their ease．According to an ancient Nordic law a man was not held responsible for what he had said in a forge．The tongues were loosened in Africa as well in the blacksmith's shop，and the talk flowed freely；audacious fancies were set forth to the inspiring hammer song．

Pooran Singh was with me for many years and was a well-paid functionary of the farm．There was no proportion between his wages and his needs，for he was an ascetic of the first water．He did not eat meat，he did not drink，or smoke，or gamble，his old clothes were worn to the thread．He sent his money over to India for the education of his children．A small silent son of his，Delip Singh，once came over from Bombay on a visit to his father．He had lost touch with the iron，the only metal that I saw about him was a fountain pen in his pocket．The mythical qualities were not carried on in the second generation．

But Pooran Singh himself，raging above the forge，kept his halo as long as he was on the farm，and I hope as long as he lived．He was the servant of the gods，heated through，white hot，an elemental spirit．In Pooran Singh's blacksmith's shop the hammer sang to you what you wanted to hear，as if it was giving voice to your own heart．To me myself the hammer was singing an ancient Greek verse，which a friend had translated：

Eros struck out，like a smith with his hammer，

So that the sparks flew from my defiance．

He cooled my heart in tears and lamentations，

Like red-hot iron in a stream．





A Strange Happening


When I was down in the Masai Reserve，doing transport for the government，I one day saw a strange thing，such as no one I know has ever seen．It took place in the middle of the day，while we were trekking over grass-country．

The air in Africa is more significant in the landscape than in Europe，it is filled with loomings and mirages，and is in a way the real stage of activities．In the heat of the midday the air oscillates and vibrates like the string of a violin，lifts up long layers of grass-land with thorn-trees and hills on it，and creates vast silvery expanses of water in the dry grass．

We were walking along in this burning live air，and I was，against my habit，a long way in front of the wagons，with Farah，my dog Dusk and the Toto who looked after Dusk．We were silent，for it was too hot to talk．All at once the plain at the horizon began to move and gallop with more than the atmosphere；a big herd of game was bearing down upon us from the right，diagonally across the stage．

I said to Farah：“Look at all these wildebeests．”But a little after，I was not sure that they were wildebeests；I took up my field-glasses and looked at them，but that too is difficult in the middle of the day．“Are they wildebeests，Farah，do you think？”I asked him．

I now saw that Dusk had all his attention upon the animals，his ears up in the air，his far-seeing eyes following their advance．I often used to let him have a run after the gazelles and antelopes on the plains，but today I thought that it would be too hot，and told the Toto to fasten his lead to his collar．At that same moment，Dusk gave a short wild yell and jumped forward so that the Toto was thrown over，and I snatched the lead myself and had to hold him with all my might．I looked at the game．“What are they？”I asked Farah．

It is very difficult to judge distances on the plains．The quivering air and the monotony of the scenery make it so，also the character of the scattered thorn-trees，which have the exact shape of mighty old forest trees，but are in reality only twelve feet high，so that the giraffes raise their heads and necks above them．You are continually deceived as to the size of the game that you see at a distance and may，in the middle of the day，mistake a jackal for an eland，and an ostrich for a buffalo．A minute later Farah said：“Memsahib，these are wild dogs．”

The wild dogs are generally seen three or four at a time，but it happens that you meet a dozen of them together．The Natives are afraid of them，and will tell you that they are very murderous．Once as I was riding in the Reserve close to the farm I came upon four wild dogs which followed me at a distance of fifteen yards．The two small terriers that I had with me then kept as close to me as possible，actually under the belly of the pony，until we came across the river and on to the farm．The wild dogs are not as big as a hyena．They are about the size of a big alsatian dog．They are black，with a white tuft at the tip of the tail and of the pointed ears．The skin is no good，it has rough uneven hair and smells badly．

Here there must have been five hundred wild dogs．They came along in a slow canter，in the strangest way，looking neither right nor left，as if they had been frightened by something，or as if they were travelling fast with a fixed purpose on a track．They just swerved a bit as they came nearer to us；all the same they hardly seemed to see us，and went on at the same pace．When they were closest to us，they were fifty yards away．They were running in a long file，two or three or four side by side，it took time before the whole procession had passed us．In the middle of it，Farah said：“These dogs are very tired，they have run a long way．”

When they had all gone by，and were disappearing again，we looked round for the safari．It was still some way behind us，and exhausted by our agitation of mind we sat down where we stood in the grass，until it came up to us．Dusk was terribly upset，jerking his lead to run after the wild dogs．I took him round the neck，if I had not tied him up in time，I thought，he would by now have been eaten up．

The drivers of the wagons detached themselves from the safari and came running up to us，to ask us what it had all been．I could not explain to them，or to myself，what had made the wild dogs come along in so great a number in such a way．The Natives all took it as a very bad omenan omen of the war，for the wild dogs are carrion-eaters．They did not afterwards discuss the happening much among themselves，as they used to discuss all the other events of the safari．

I have told this tale to many people and not one of them has believed it．All the same it is true，and my boys can bear me witness．





The Parrot


An old Danish shipowner sat and thought of his young days and of how he had，when he was sixteen years old，spent a night in a brothel in Singapore．He had come in there with the sailors of his father's ship，and had sat and talked with an old Chinese woman．When she heard that he was a native of a distant country she brought out an old parrot，that belonged to her．Long，long ago，she told him，the parrot had been given her by a high-born English lover of her youth．The boy thought that the bird must then be a hundred years old．It could say various sentences in the languages of all the world，picked up in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the house．But one phrase the old Chinawoman's lover had taught it before he sent it to her，and that she did not understand，neither had any visitor ever been able to tell her what it meant．So now for many years she had given up asking．But if the boy came from far away perhaps it was his language，and he could interpret the phrase to her．

The boy had been deeply，strangely moved at the suggestion．When he looked at the parrot，and thought that he might hear Danish from that terrible beak，he very nearly ran out of the house．He stayed on only to do the old Chinese woman a service．But when she made the parrot speak its sentence，it turned out to be classic Greek．The bird spoke its words very slowly，and the boy knew enough Greek to recognize it；it was a verse from Sappho：

The moon has sunk and the Pleiads，

And midnight is gone，

And the hours are passing，passing，

And I lie alone．



The old woman，when he translated the lines to her，smacked her lips and rolled her small slanting eyes．She asked him to say it again，and nodded her head．





FAREWELL TO THE FARM


“Gods and men，we are all deluded thus！”





Hard Times


My farm was a little too high up for growing coffee．It happened in the cold months that we would get frost on the lower land and in the morning the shoots of the coffee-trees，and the young coffee-berries on them，would be all brown and withered．The wind blew in from the plains，and even in good years we never got the same yield of coffee to the acre as the people in the lower districts of Thika and Kiambu，at four thousand feet．

We were short of rain，as well，in the Ngong country，and three times we had a year of real drought，which brought us very low down．In a year in which we had fifty inches of rain，we picked eighty tons of coffee，and in a year of fifty-five inches，nearly ninety tons；but there were two bad years in which we had only twenty-five and twenty inches of rain，and picked only sixteen and fifteen tons of coffee，and those years were disastrous to the farm．

At the same time coffee prices fell：where we had got a hundred pounds a ton we now got sixty or seventy．Times grew hard on the farm．We could not pay our debts，and we had no money for the running of the plantation．My people at home，who had shares in the farm，wrote out to me and told me that I would have to sell．




I thought out many devices for the salvation of the farm．One year I tried to grow flax on our spare land．Flax-growing is a lovely job，but it needs much skill and experience．I had a Belgian refugee to give me advice on it，and when he asked me how much land I meant to plant，and I told him three hundred acres，he immediately exclaimed：Ça，madame，c'est impossible．I might grow five acres or even ten with success，he said，but no more．But ten acres would take us nowhere，and I put in a hundred and fifty acres．A sky-blue flowering flax field is a marvellously pretty sight—like a piece of heaven on earth and there can be no more gratifying kind of goods to be turning out than the flax fibre，tough and glossy，and slightly greasy to the touch．You follow it in your thoughts as it is sent away，and imagine it made into sheets and nightgowns．But the Kikuyu could not，in the turn of a hand and without constant supervision，be taught to be accurate enough in the pulling and retting and scutching of it；and so my flax-growing was no success．

Most of the farmers in the country were，in those years，trying their hand at some such scheme，and to a few of them in the end an inspiration came．Things turned out well for Ingrid Lindstrom of Njoro：at the time when I had left the country，and after she had slaved for twelve years at her market gardening，pigs，turkeys，castor-oil bushes，and soya beans，had seen them all fail，and wept over them，she saved her farm for her family and herself by planting pyrethrum，which is sent to London and is there used in making insecticide．But I myself had no luck with my experiments，and when the dry weather and the wind from the Athi plains set in，the coffee-trees drooped and the leaves turned yellow；on parts of the farm we got bad coffee diseases like thrips and antestia．

To bring the coffee on we tried to manure the fields．It had always，as I had been brought up with European ideas on farming，gone against me to take the crops out of the land，without manuring．When the squatters of the farm heard of the project they came forward to help me，and brought out，from their cattle and goat bomas，the manure of decades．It was delicate peaty stuff that was easy to handle．We ploughed up a furrow between the rows of coffee-trees，with the small new ploughs with a single ox to them that we had bought in Nairobi，and，since we could not get a cart into the fields，the women of the farm carried the manure in sacks on their backs，and spread it in the furrow，a sack to the tree，so that we could lead back the oxen and ploughs，and cover it up．It was pleasant work to watch，and I expected great things from it，but as it came to happen，no one ever saw the effects of the manuring．

One real trouble was that we were short of capital，for it had all been spent in the old days before I took over the running of the farm．We could not carry through any radical improvements，but had to live from hand to mouth—and this，in the last years，became our normal mode of living on the farm．

If I had had the capital，I thought，I would have given up coffee，have cut down the coffee-trees，and have planted forest trees on my land．Trees grow up so quickly in Africa，in ten years' time you walk comfortably under tall blue-gum trees，and wattle trees，which you have yourself，in the rain，carried in boxes from the nurseries，twelve trees in a box．I would have had then，I reflected，a good market for both timber and firewood in Nairobi．It is a noble occupation to plant trees，you think of it many years after with content．There had been big stretches of native forest on the farm in the old days，but it had been sold to the Indians for cutting down，before I took over the farm；it was a sad thing．I myself in the hard years had had to cut down the wood on my land round the factory for the steam-engine，and this forest，with the tall stems and the live green shadows in it，had haunted me，I have not felt more sorry for anything I have done in my life，than for cutting it down．From time to time，when I could afford it，I planted up bits of land with eucalyptus trees，but it did not come to much．It would be，in this way，fifty years before I had got the many hundred acres planted up，and had changed the farm into a singing wood，scientifically run，with a sawmill by the river．The Squatters of the farm，though，whose ideas of time were different from those of the white people，kept on looking forward hopefully to the time when everybody would have abundance of firewood—such as the people had had in the old days—from the forest that I was now soon going to plant．

I had also plans of keeping cattle and running a dairy on the farm．We were situated in an unclean area，which means that you have got East Coast fever on the land，and that if you will keep grade stock you have got to dip your cattle．It makes it harder to compete with the cattle people up-country in the clean areas，but then I had Nairobi so close that I could send in milk there by car in the morning．We once owned a herd of grade cows，and then we built a fine cattle dip on the plain．But we had to sell out，and the cattle dip，overgrown with grass，afterwards stood like a sunk and overturned ruin of a castle in the air．Later on，when in the evening，at milking time，I walked down to Mauge's or Kaninu's boma，and smelled the sweet scent of the cows，I felt again a pang of longing for cow-stables and a dairy of my own．When I rode on the plain，in my mind I saw it dotted，as with flowers，with brindled cows．

But these plans grew very distant in the course of the years，and in the end they could hardly be distinguished．I did not mind either，if I could only make the coffee pay，and keep the farm going．

It is a heavy burden to carry a farm on you．My Natives，and my white people even，left me to dread and worry on their behalf，and it sometimes seemed to me that the farm oxen and the coffee-trees themselves，were doing the same．It appeared to be agreed upon，then，by the speaking creatures and the dumb，that it was my fault that the rains were late and the nights so cold．And in the evening it did not seem right that I should sit down quietly to read；I was driven out of my house by the fear of losing it．Farah knew of all my sorrows，and he did not approve of my walks at night．He talked about the leopards that had been seen close to the house when the sun was down；and he used to stand on the verandah，a white-robed figure just visible in the dark，until I came in again．But I was too sad to get any idea of leopards into my mind，I knew that I did no good whatever by going round on the roads of the farm in the night，and still I went，like a ghost that is just said to walk，without any definition as to why or where to．

Two years before I left Africa I was in Europe on a visit．I travelled back in the coffee-picking season，so that I could not get news of the harvest before I came to Mombasa．All the time on the boat I was weighing the problem in my mind：when I was well and life was looking friendly，I reckoned that we would have got seventy-five tons，but when I was unwell or nervous I thought：We are bound to get sixty tons in any case．

Farah came to meet me in Mombasa，and I dared not ask him about the coffee crop straight away；for some time we talked of other news of the farm．But in the evening as I was going to bed，I could not put it off any longer and I asked him how many tons of coffee they had picked on the farm in all．The Somalis are generally pleased to announce a disaster．But here Farah was not happy，he was extremely grave himself，standing up by the door，and he half closed his eyes and laid back his head，swallowing his sorrow，when he said：“Forty tons，Memsahib．”At that I knew that we could not carry on．All colour and life faded out of the world round me；the bleak and stifling Mombasa hotel room，with the cemented floor，old iron bedstead and worn mosquito-net，took on a tremendous significance as the symbol of the world，without any single ornament or article of embellishment of human life in it．I did not say anything more to Farah，and he did not speak again，but went away，the last friendly object in the world．

Still the human mind has great powers of self-renewal，and in the middle of the night I thought，with Old Knudsen，that forty tons was something，but that pessimism—pessimism was a fatal vice．And in any case I was going home now，I would be turning up the drive once more．My people were there，and my friends would come out to visit me．In ten hours I was to see，from the railway，to the south-west，the blue silhouette against the sky of the Ngong Hills．




The same year the grasshoppers came on the land．It was said that they came from Abyssinia；after two years of drought up there，they travelled south and ate up all vegetation on their way．Before we ever saw them，there were strange tales circulating in the country of the devastation that they had left behind them—up north，maize and wheat and fruit farms were all one vast desert where they had passed．The settlers sent runners to their neighbours to the south to announce the coming of the grasshoppers．Still you could not do much against them even if you were warned．On all the farms people had tall piles of firewood and maize-stalks ready and set fire to them when the grasshoppers came，and they sent out all the farm labourers with empty tins and cans，and told them to shout and yell and beat the tins to frighten them from landing．But it was a short respite only，for however much the farmers would frighten them the grasshoppers could not keep up in the air for ever；the only thing that each farmer could hope for was to drive them off to the next farm to the south，and the more farms they were scared away from，the hungrier and more desperate were they，when in the end they settled．I myself had the great plains of the Masai Reserve to the south，so that I might hope to keep the grasshoppers on the wing and send them over the river to the Masai．

I had three or four runners announcing the arrival of the grasshoppers，from neighbourly settlers of the district，already，but nothing more had happened，and I began to believe that it was all a false alarm．One afternoon I rode over to our dhuka，a farm shop of all goods，kept for the farm labourers and the squatters by Farah's small brother Abdullai．It was on the highroad，and an Indian in a mule-trap outside the dhuka rose in his trap and beckoned to me as I passed，since he could not drive up to me on the plain．

“The grasshoppers are coming，Madam，please，on to your land，”said he when I rode up to him．

“I have been told that many times，”I said，“but I have seen nothing of them．Perhaps it is not so bad as people tell．”

“Turn round kindly，madam，”said the Indian．

I turned round and saw，along the northern horizon，a shadow on the sky，like a long stretch of smoke，a town burning，“a million-peopled city vomiting smoke in the bright air，”I thought，or like a thin cloud rising．

“What is that？”I asked．

“Grasshoppers，”said the Indian．

I saw a few grasshoppers，perhaps twenty in all，on the path across the plain as I rode back．I passed my manager's house and instructed him to have everything ready for receiving the grasshoppers．As together we looked north the black smoke on the sky had grown up a little higher．From time to time while we were watching it，a grasshopper swished past us in the air，or dropped on the ground and crawled on．

The next morning as I opened my door and looked out，the whole landscape outside was the colour of pale dull terra-cotta．The trees，the lawn，the drive，all that I could see，was covered with the dye，as if in the night a thick layer of terra-cotta-coloured snow had fallen on the land．The grasshoppers were sitting there．While I stood and looked at it，all the scenery began to quiver and break，the grasshoppers moved and lifted，after a few minutes the atmosphere fluttered with wings，they were going off．

That time they did not do much damage to the farm，they had been staying with us over the night only．We had seen what they were like，about an inch and a half long，brownish grey and pink，sticky to touch．They had broken a couple of big trees in my drive simply by sitting on them，and when you looked at the trees and remembered that each of the grasshoppers could only weigh a tenth of an ounce，you began to conceive the number of them．

The grasshoppers came again；for two or three months we had continued attacks of them on the farm．We soon gave up trying to frighten them off，it was a hopeless and tragi-comical undertaking．At times a small swarm would come along，a free corps which had detached itself from the main force，and would just pass in a rush．But at other times the grasshoppers came in big flights，which took days to pass over the farm，twelve hours' incessant hurling advance in the air．When the flight was at its highest it was like a blizzard at home，whistling and shrieking like a strong wind，little hard furious wings to all sides of you and over your head，shining like thin blades of steel in the sun，but themselves darkening the sun．The grasshoppers keep in a belt，from the ground up to the top of the trees，beyond that the air is clear．They whir against your face，they get into your collar and your sleeves and shoes．The rush round you makes you giddy and fills you with a particular sickening rage and despair，the horror of the mass．The individual amongst it does not count，kill it and it makes no difference to anybody．After the grasshoppers have passed and have gone towards the horizon like a long streak of thinning smoke，the feeling of disgust at your own face and hands，which have been crawled upon by grasshoppers，stays with you for a long time．

A great flight of birds followed the advance of the grasshoppers，circled above them and came down and walked in the fields when they settled，living high on the horde：storks and cranes—pompous profiteers．

At times the grasshoppers settled on the farm．They did not do much harm to the coffee-plantation，the leaves of the coffee-trees，similar to laurel leaves，are too hard for them to chew．They could only break a tree here and there in the field．

But the maize fields were a sad sight when they had been on them and had left，there was nothing there now but a few laps of dry leaves hanging from the broken stalks．My garden by the river，that had been irrigated and kept green，was now like a dust-heap—flowers，vegetables and herbs had all gone．The shambas of the squatters were like stretches of cleared and burnt land，rolled even by the crawling insects，with a dead grasshopper in the dust here and there as the sole fruit of the soil．The squatters stood and looked at them．The old women who had dug and planted the shambas，standing on their heads，shook their fists at the last faint black disappearing shadow in the sky．

A lot of dead grasshoppers were left behind the army everywhere．On the highroad，where they had sat，and where the wagons and carts had passed，and had driven over them，now，after the swarm had gone，the wheel-tracks were marked，like rails of a railway，as long as you could see them，with little bodies of dead grasshoppers．

The grasshoppers had laid their eggs in the soil．Next year，after the long rains，the little black-brown hoppers appeared—grasshoppers in the first stage of life，that cannot fly，but which crawl along and eat up everything upon their march．

When I had no more money，and could not make things pay，I had to sell the farm．A big company in Nairobi bought it．They thought that the place was too high up for coffee，and they were not going in for farming．But they meant to take up all the coffee-trees，to divide up the land and lay out roads，and in time，when Nairobi should be growing out to the west，they meant to sell the land for building-plots．That was towards the end of the year．

Even as it was then，I do not think that I should have found it in me to give up the farm if it had not been for one thing．The coffee crop that was still unripe upon the trees belonged to the old owners of the farm，or to the Bank which was holding a first mortgage in it．This coffee would not be picked，handled in the factory and sent off，till May or later．For such a period I was to remain on the farm，in charge of it，and things were to go on，unaltered to the view．And during this time，I thought，something would happen to change it all back，since the world，after all，was not a regular or calculable place．

In this way began for me a strange era in my existence on the farm．The truth that was underlying everything，was that it was no longer mine，but such as it was，this truth could be ignored by the people incapable of realizing it，and it made no difference to things from day to day．It was then，from hour to hour，a lesson in the art of living in the moment，or，it might be said，in eternity，wherein the actual happenings of the moment make but little difference．

It was a curious thing that I myself did not，during this time，ever believe that I would have to give up the farm or to leave Africa．I was told that I must do so by the people round me，all of them reasonable men；I had letters from home by each mail to prove it，and all the facts of my daily life pointed to it．All the same nothing was farther from my thoughts，and I kept on believing that I should come to lay my bones in Africa．For this firm faith I had no other foundation，or no other reason，than my complete incompetence of imagine anything else．

During these months，I formed in my own mind a programme，or system of strategy，against destiny，and against the people in my surrounding who were her confederates．I shall give in，I thought，from this time forward，in all minor matters，to save myself unnecessary trouble．I shall let my adversaries have their way from day to day in these affairs，in talk and writing．For in the end I shall still come out triumphant and shall keep my farm and the people on it．Lose them，I thought，I cannot：it cannot be imagined，how then can it happen？

In this way I was the last person to realize that I was going．When I look back upon my last months in Africa，it seems to me that the lifeless things were aware of my departure a long time before I was so myself．The hills，the forests，plains and rivers，the wind，all knew that we were to part．When I first began to make terms with fate，and the negotiations about the sale of the farm were taken up，the attitude of the landscape towards me changed．Till then I had been part of it，and the drought had been to me like a fever，and the flowering of the plain like a new frock．Now the country disengaged itself from me，and stood back a little，in order that I should see it clearly and as a whole．

The hills can do the same thing in the week before the rains．On an evening as you look at them，they suddenly make a great movement and uncover，they become as manifest，as distinct and vivid in form and colour，as if they meant to yield themselves to you，with all that they contain，as if you could walk from where you sit，on to the green slope．You think：if a bushbuck now walked out in the open，I might see its eyes as it turned its head，its ears moving；if a little bird settled on a twig of a bush，I should hear it sing．In the hills，in March，this gesture of abandon means that the rains are near，but here，to me，it meant parting．

I have before seen other countries，in the same manner，give themselves to you when you are about to leave them，but I had forgotten what it meant．I only thought that I had never seen the country so lovely，as if the contemplation of it would in itself be enough to make you happy all your life．Light and shade shared the landscape between them；rainbows stood in the sky．

When I was with other white people，lawyers and business men of Nairobi，or with my friends who gave me advice about my journey，my isolation from them felt very strange，and sometimes like a physical thing—a kind of suffocation．I looked upon myself as the one reasonable person amongst them all；but once or twice it happened to me to reflect that if I had been mad，amongst sane people，I should have felt just the same．

The Natives of the farm，in the stark realism of their souls，were conscious of the situation and of my state of mind，as fully as if I had been lecturing to them upon it，or had written it down for them in a book．All the same，they looked to me for help and support，and did not，in a single case，attempt to arrange their future for themselves．They tried their very best to make me stay on，and for this purpose invented many schemes which they confided to me．At the time when the sale of the farm was through，they came and sat round my house from the early morning till night，not so much in order to talk with me as just to follow all my movements．There is a paradoxical moment in the relation between the leader and the followers：that they should see every weakness and failing in him so clearly，and be capable of judging him with such unbiased accuracy，and yet should still inevitably turn to him，as if in life there were，physically，no way round him．A flock of sheep may be feeling the same towards the herdboy，they will have infinitely better knowledge of the country and the weather than he，and still will be walking after him，if needs be，straight into the abyss．The Kikuyu took the situation better than I did，on account of their superior inside knowledge of God and the Devil，but they sat round my house and waited for my orders；very likely all the time between themselves expatiating freely upon my ignorance and my unique incapacity．

You would have thought that their constant presence by my house，when I knew that I could not help them，and when their fate weighed heavily on my mind，would have been hard to bear．But it was not so．We felt，I believe，up to the very last，a strange comfort and relief in each other's company．The understanding between us lay deeper than all reason．I thought in these months much of Napoleon on the retreat from Moscow．It is generally thought that he went through agonies in seeing his grand army suffering and dying round him，but it is also possible that he would have dropped down dead on the spot if he had not had them．In the night，I counted the hours till the time when the Kikuyus should turn up again by the house．





Death of Kinanjui


In that same year the Chief Kinanjui died．One of his sons came to my house late in the evening and asked me to go back with him to his father's village，for he was dying：Nataka kufa—he wants to die—the Natives have it．

Kinanjui was now an old man．A great thing had lately happened in his life：the quarantine regulations of the Masai Reserve had been suspended．The old Kikuyu chief，as soon as he heard of it，set forth in person，with a few retainers，deep down south in the Reserve，to wind up his multifarious accounts with the Masai，and bring back with him the cows that belonged to him，together with the calves that they had produced in their exile．While he was down there he had fallen ill；as far as I could understand he had been butted in the thigh by a cow，which seemed a becoming cause of death to a Kikuyu chief，and the wound had gone gangrenous．Kinanjui had been staying too long with the Masai，or had been too ill to undertake the long journey，when at last he turned his face homewards．Probably he had so set his heart on getting all his stock with him，that he had not had it in him to leave until they were all collected，and it is also possible that he had let himself be nursed by one of his married daughters there，until a slight misgiving had risen in him as to her goodwill to bring him through his illness．In the end he started，and it seemed that his attendants had done their best for him and had taken great trouble to get him home，carrying the deadly sick old man for long distances on a stretcher．Now he lay dying in his hut，and had sent for me．

Kinanjui's son had come to my house after dinner，and it was dark when Farah and I and he drove over to his village，but the moon was up and in her first quarter．On the way Farah opened up the subject of who was to succeed Kinanjui as chief of the Kikuyu．The old Chief had many sons，it appeared that there were various influences at work in the Kikuyu world．Two of his sons，Farah told me，were Christians，but one was a Roman Catholic，and the other a convert to the Church of Scotland，and each of the two missions was sure to take pains to get their pretender proclaimed．The Kikuyus themselves，it seemed，wanted a third，younger，heathen son．

The road for the last mile was nothing more than a cattle-track over the sward．The grass was grey with dew．Just before we got to the village we had to cross a river-bed with a little winding silvery stream in the middle；here we drove through a white mist．Kinanjui's big manyatta，when we got up to it，was all quiet under the moon，a wide compound of huts，small peaked store-huts and cattle-bomas．As we were turning into it，in the light of our lamps I caught sight，under a thatched roof，of the car which Kinanjui had bought from the American Consul at the time when he came over to the farm to give judgment in the case of Wanyangerri．She looked completely forlorn，all rusty and dilapidated，and surely now Kinanjui would be giving her no thought，but would have turned back to the ways of his fathers，and demand to see cows and women round him．

The village that looked so dark was not asleep，the people were up and came and surrounded us when they heard the car．But it was changed from what it used to be．Kinanjui's manyatta was always a lively and noisy place，like a well spouting from the ground and running over on all sides；plans and projects were crossing one another in all directions，and all under the eye of the pompous，benevolent，central figure of Kinanjui．Now the wing of death lay over the manyatta，and，like a strong magnet，it had altered the patterns below，forming new constellations and groups．The welfare of each member of the family and tribe was at stake，and such scenes and intrigues as are always played round a royal death-bed were，you felt，alive here，in the strong smell of cows，and in the dim moonlight．As we got out of the car，a boy with a lamp came along and took us up to Kinanjui's hut，and a crowd of people went with us and stood outside it．

I had never before been inside Kinanjui's house．This royal mansion was a good deal bigger than the ordinary Kikuyu hut，but when I entered it I found it to be no more luxuriously furnished．There was a bedstead made out of sticks and reins in it，and a few wooden stools to sit on．Two or three fires burned on the stamped clay floor，the heat in the hut was suffocating，and the smoke was so dense that at first I could not see who was in there，although they had a hurricane lamp standing on the floor．When I had got a little more used to the atmosphere I saw that there were three old bald men in the room with me，uncles or councillors of Kinanjui，a very old woman who hung on a stick and remained close to the bed，a young pretty girl，and a boy of thirteen—and what new constellation，worked by the magnet，was this，in the Chief's death-chamber？

Kinanjui lay flat on his bed．He was dying，he was already half-way into death and dissolution，and the stench about him was so stifling that at first I dared not open my mouth to speak for fear that I should be sick．The old man was all naked，he was lying upon a tartan rug that I had once given him，but probably he could not stand any weight at all on his poisoned leg．The leg was terrible to look at，so swollen that you could not distinguish the place of the knee，and in the lamplight I could see that it was streaked all the way from the hip to the foot with black and yellow streaks．Underneath the leg，the rug was dark and wet as if water was all the time running from it．

Kinanjui's son，who had come to the farm to fetch me，brought in an old European chair，with one leg shorter than the others，and placed it very close to the bed，for me to sit on．

Kinanjui's head and trunk were so emaciated that all the structure of his big skeleton stood forth，he looked like a huge dark wooden figure roughly cut with a knife．His teeth and his tongue showed between his lips．His eyes were half dimmed，milky in his dark face．But he could still see，and when I came up to the bed he turned his eyes on me and kept them on my face all the time that I was in the hut．

Very very slowly he dragged his right hand across his body to touch my hand．He was in terrible pain，but he was still himself and was still carrying great weight，naked upon his bed．From the look of him，I thought that he had come back from his journey triumphant，and had got all his cattle back with him，in spite of his Masai sons-in-law．I remembered，while I sat and looked at him，that he had had one weakness：he had been afraid of thunder，and when a thunderstorm broke，while he was in my house，he adopted a rodent manner and looked round for a burrow．But here now he feared no more the lightning flash，nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone：he had plainly，I thought，done his worldly task，gone home，and taken his wages in every sense．If he were clear enough in his mind to look back at his life，he would find very few instances in which he had not got the better of it．A great vitality and power of enjoyment，a manifold activity were at their end here，where Kinanjui lay still．“Quiet consummation have，Kinanjui”—I thought．

The old men in the hut stood by，as if they had lost the faculty of speech．It was the boy，who had been in there when I came，and whom I took to be a late-born son of Kinanjui's，who now came up close to his father's bed and talked to me，in accordance，I thought，with what had been agreed upon before I arrived．

The doctor from the mission，he explained，had heard of Kinanjui's illness and had been to see him．He had told the Kikuyus that he would come back again to fetch the dying chief into the mission hospital，and they were expecting the lorry from the mission which was to bring him there，that same night．But Kinanjui did not want to go into hospital．That was why he had sent for me．He wanted me to take him with me to my own house，and he meant me to take him now，before the people from the mission should return．While the boy spoke，Kinanjui looked at me．

I sat and listened with a heavy heart．

If Kinanjui had lain dying at any time in the past，a year ago or even three months ago，I would have taken him with me to my house on his asking for it．But today it was a different thing．Things had gone badly with me lately and had made me fear that they would go on worse．I had been spending days in the offices of Nairobi，listening to businessmen and lawyers，and at meetings with the creditors of the farm．The house，to which Kinanjui asked me to take him，was no longer my own house．

Kinanjui，I thought，as I sat and looked at him，was going to die，he could not be saved．He would die in my car on the way home，or at the arrival to the house．The mission people would come and blame me for his death；everybody who heard of it would agree with them．

All this，from my seat on the broken chair in the hut，looked to me as a weight too heavy to take on．I had not got it in me any longer to stand up against the authorities of the world．I did not have it in me now to brave them all，not all of them．

I tried two or three times to make up my mind to take Kinanjui and my courage failed me every time．I thought then that I should have to leave him．

Farah had stood by the door，and had followed the boy's speech．When he saw me sitting on silent，he came up to me and in a low eager voice began an explanation of how we were best to lift Kinanjui into the car．I got up and went with him to the background of the hut，somewhat away from the eyes and the stench of the old man on the bed．I told Farah then that I was not going to take Kinanjui back with me．Farah was completely unprepared for this turn of things；his eyes and whole face darkened with surprise．

I should have liked to have stayed a little with Kinanjui，but I did not want to see the people from the mission arrive and take him away．

I went up to Kinanjui's bed and told him that I could not take him with me back to my house．There was no need to give reasons，so we left it at that．The old men in the hut，when they understood my declination that I declined，gathered round me and stirred uneasily，the boy stepped back a little and stood immovable，he had no more to do．Kinanjui himself did not stir or change in any way，he kept his eyes on me as he had done all the time．He looked as if something like this had happened to him before，which very likely it had．

“Kwaheri ，Kinanjui，”I said—Good-bye．

His burning fingers moved a little against my palm．Already before I had got to the door of the hut，when I turned and looked back，the dimness and smoke of the room had swallowed up the big outstretched figure of my Kikuyu Chief．As I came out again from the hut it was very cold．The moon was now low down at the horizon，it must have been past midnight．Just then in the manyatta one of Kinanjui's cocks crew twice．

Kinanjui died that same night，in the mission hospital．Two of his sons came over to my house next afternoon to tell me．They did at the same time ask me to the funeral，which was to take place on the following day，near his village，at Dagoretti．

The Kikuyus，when left to themselves，do not bury their dead，but leave them above ground for the kyenas and vulture to deal with．The custom had always appealed to me，I thought that it would be a pleasant thing to be laid out to the sun and the stars，and to be so promptly，neatly and openly picked and cleansed；to be made one with Nature and become a common component of a landscape．At the time when we had the Spanish flu on the farm，I heard the hyenas round the shambas all night，and often，after those days，I would find a brown smooth skull in the long grass of the forest，like a nut dropped down under a tree，or on the plain．But the practice does not go with the conditions of civilized life．The government had taken much trouble to make the Kikuyu change their ways，and to teach them to lay their dead in the ground，but they still did not like the idea at all．

Kinanjui，they now told me，was to be buried，and I thought that the Kikuyu would have agreed to make an exception from their habit because the dead had been a chief．Perhaps they would like to make a great Native show and gathering of the occasion．I drove over to Dagoretti，on the following afternoon，expecting to find all the old minor chiefs of the country，and to see a big Kikuyu festivity．

But Kinanjui's funeral was altogether a European and clerical affair．There were a few government representatives present，the district commissioner and two officials from Nairobi．But the day and the place belonged to the clergy；and the plain，in the afternoon sun，was black with them．Both the French Mission and the Missions of the Church of England and Scotland，were richly represented．If they wished to impress the Kikuyu with the feeling that here they had laid their hand on the dead chief，and that he now belonged to them，they succeeded．They were so obviously in power that one felt it to be out of the question for Kinanjui to get away from them．This is an old trick of the Church's．Here I saw for the first time，in any number to speak of，the mission-boys，the converted Natives，half sacerdotally attired，whatever office they might be filling，fat young Kikuyus with spectacles and folded hands，who looked like ungenial eunuchs．Probably Kinanjui's two Christian sons were there，laying down their religious disagreements for the day，but I did not know them．Some of the old chiefs were attending the funeral．Keoy was there，and I talked with him for some time of Kinanjui．But they kept themselves much in the background of the show．

Kinanjui's grave had been dug under a couple of tall eucalyptus trees on the plain，and a rope was extended round it．I had come early and therefore stood close to the grave，by the rope，from where I could watch the assemblage grow and settle，like flies，round it．

They brought Kinanjui from the mission on a lorry，and lifted him down near the grave．I do not think that I have ever in my life been more taken aback and appalled than I was then，at the sight of him．He had been a big man，and I remembered him as I had seen him when he came walking over to the farm amongst his senators，even as he had looked lying on his bed，two nights ago．But the coffin in which they now brought him was a nearly square box，surely no more than five feet long．I did not take it to be a coffin when I first set eyes on it；it must be，I thought，some box of appliances for the funeral．But it was Kinanjui's coffin．I have never known why it was chosen，perhaps it was a thing that they had had at the Scotch Mission．But how had they got Kinanjui down there and how was he now lying in it？They placed the coffin on the ground，close to where I stood．

The coffin had a large silver plate on it with an inscription，which told，I was afterwards informed，that it had been given by the mission to the Chief Kinanjui，and with a scriptural text on it．

There was a long funeral service．One after another，the missionaries stood forth and spoke，and I suppose that they got in much profession and admonition．But I did not hear any of it，I was holding on to the rope round Kinanjui's grave．Some of the Christian Natives followed them up，and brayed out over the green plain．

In the end Kinanjui was lowered into the ground of his own country，and covered with it．

I had taken my houseboys with me to Dagoretti so that they should see the funeral，and they were staying to talk with their friends and relations there，and coming back on foot，so that Farah and I drove home by ourselves．Farah was as silent as the grave we had left．It had been hard to Farah to swallow the fact that I would not take Kinanjui back to my house with me；for two days he had been like a lost soul，and in the clutch of great doubts and depressions．

Now as we drove up before the door he said：“Never mind，Memsahib．”





The Grave in the Hills


Denys Finch-Hatton had come in from one of his safaris，and he had stayed for a little while on the farm，but，when I began to break up my house and to pack，and he could stay there no longer，he went away and lived in Hugh Martin's house in Nairobi．From there he drove out to the farm every day and dined with me，sitting—towards the end，when I was selling my furniture—on one packing-case and dining from another．We sat there late into the night．

A few times，Denys and I spoke as if I was really going to leave the country．He himself looked upon Africa as his home，and he understood me very well and grieved with me then，even if he laughed at my distress at parting with my people．

“Do you feel，”he said，“that you cannot live without Sirunga？”

“Yes，”I said．

But most of the time when we were together，we talked and acted as if the future did not exist；it had never been his way to worry about it，for it was as if he knew that he could draw upon forces unknown to us if he wanted to．He fell in naturally with my scheme of leaving things to themselves，and other people to think and say what they liked．When he was there，it seemed to be a normal thing，and in accordance with our own taste，that we should sit upon packing-cases within an empty house．He quoted a poem to me：

You must turn your mournful ditty

To a merry measure，

I will never come for pity，

I will come for pleasure．



During those weeks，we used to go up for short flights out over the Ngong Hills or down over the Game Reserve．One morning，Denys came out to the farm to fetch me quite early，just as the sun was up，and then we saw a lion on the plain south of the hills．

He talked of packing up his books，that had been in my house for many years，but he never got any further with the job．

“You keep them，”he said，“now I have no place to put them．”

He could not make up his mind at all where to go when my house should be closed．Once，upon the persistent advice of a friend，he went so far as to drive in to Nairobi，and to take a look at the bungalows to be let there，but he came back so repelled with what he had seen that he did not even like to talk about it，and at dinner，when he began to give me a description of the houses and the furniture，he stopped himself and sat silent over it，with a dislike and sadness in his face that was unusual to him．He had been in contact with a kind of existence the idea of which was unbearable to him．

It was，however，a completely objective and impersonal disapprobation，he had forgotten that he himself had meant to be a party to this existence，and when I spoke of it，he interrupted me．“Oh，as to me，”he said，“I shall be perfectly happy in a tent in the Masai Reserve，or I shall take a house in the Somali village．”

But on this occasion he，for once，spoke of my future in Europe．I might be happier there than on the farm，he thought，and well out of the sort of civilization that we were going to get in Africa．“You know，”he went on，“this Continent of Africa has a terrible strong sense of sarcasm．”

Denys owned a piece of land down at the coast，thirty miles north of Mombasa on the Creek of Takaunga．Here were the ruins of an old Arab settlement，with a very modest minaret and a well—a weathered growth of grey stone on the salted soil，and in the midst of it a few old Mango trees．He had built a small house on his land and I had stayed there．The scenery was of a divine，clean，barren marine greatness，with the blue Indian Ocean before you，the deep Creek of Takaunga to the south，and the long steep unbroken coast line of pale grey and yellow coral-rock as far as the eye reached．

When the tide was out，you could walk miles away seawards from the house，as on a tremendous，somewhat unevenly paved Piazza，picking up strange long peaked shells and starfish．The Swaheli fishermen came wandering along here，in a loin-cloth and red or blue turbans，like Sindbad the sailor come to life，to offer for sale multi-coloured spiked fish，some of which were very good to eat．The coast below the house had a row of scooped-out deep caves and grottoes，where you sat in shade and watched the distant glittering blue water．When the tide came in，it filled up the caves to the level of the ground on which the house was built，and in the porous coral the sea sang and sighed in the strangest way，as if the ground below your feet were alive；the long waves came running up Takaunga Creek like a storming army．

It was full moon while I was down at Takaunga，and the beauty of the radiant，still nights was so perfect that the heart bent under it．You slept with the door open to the silver sea；the playing warm breeze in a low whisper swept in a little loose sand，on to the stone floor．One night a row of Arab dhows came along，close to the coast，running noiselessly before the monsoon，a file of brown shadow sails under the moon．

Denys sometimes talked of making Takaunga his home in Africa，and of starting his safaris from there．When I began to talk of having to leave the farm，he offered me his house down there，as he had had mine in the highlands．But white people cannot live for a long time at the coast unless they are able to have many comforts，and Takaunga was too low and too hot for me．

In the month of May of the year when I left Africa，Denys went down to Takaunga for a week．He was planning to build a larger house and to plant mango trees on his land．He went away in his aeroplane and was intending to make his way home round by Voi，to see if there were any elephants there for his safaris．The Natives had been talking much of a herd of elephants which had come on to the land round Voi from the west，and in particular of one big bull，twice the size of any other elephant，that was wandering in the bush there，all by himself．

Denys，who held himself to be an exceptionally rational person，was subject to a special kind of moods and forebodings，and under their influence at times he became silent for days or for a week，though he did not know of it himself and was surprised when I asked him what was the matter with him．The last days before he started on this journey to the coast，he was in this manner absent-minded，as if sunk in contemplation，but when I spoke of it he laughed at me．

I asked him to let me come with him，for I thought what a lovely thing it would be to see the sea．First he said yes，and then he changed his mind and said no．He could not take me；the journey round Voi，he told me，was going to be very rough，he might have to land，and to sleep in the bush，so that it would be necessary for him to take a native boy with him．I reminded him that he had said that he had taken out the aeroplane to fly me over Africa．Yes，he said，so he had；and if there were elephants at Voi，he would fly me down there to have a look at them，when he knew the landing places and camping grounds．This was the only time that I have asked Denys to take me with him on his aeroplane that he would not do it．

He went off on Friday the eighth．“Look out for me on Thursday，”he said when he went，“I shall be back in time to have luncheon with you．”

When he had started in his car for the aerodrome in Nairobi，and had turned down the drive，he came back to look for a volume of poems that he had given to me，and that he now wanted with him on his journey．He stood with one foot on the running-board of the car，and a finger in the book，reading out to me a poem that we had been discussing．

“Here are your grey geese，”he said：

I saw grey geese flying over the flatlands

Wild geese vibrant in the high air—

Unswerving from horizon to horizon

With their soul stiffened out in their throats—

And the grey whiteness of them ribboning the enormous skies

And the spokes of the sun over the crumpled hills．



Then he drove away for good，waving his arm to me．

While Denys was down in Mombasa，in landing he broke a propeller．He wired back to Nairobi to get the spare parts that he wanted，and the East Africa Airway Company sent a boy to Mombasa with them．When the aeroplane was fixed，and Denys was again going up in it，he told the Airway's boy to come up with him．But the boy would not come．This boy was used to flying，and had been up with many people，and with Denys himself，before now，and Denys was a fine pilot and had a great name with the Natives in this capacity as in all others．But this time the boy would not go up with him．

A long time after，when he met Farah in Nairobi and they were talking things over，he said to Farah：“Not for a hundred rupees would I，then，have gone up with Bwana Bedâr．”The shadow of destiny，which Denys himself had felt the last days at Ngong，was seen more strongly now，by the Native．

So Denys took Kamau with him to Voi，his own boy．Poor Kamau was terrified of flying．He had told me，at the farm，that when he got up and away from the ground，he fixed his eyes at his feet and kept them there till he got down to the earth again，so frightened did he feel if ever he cast a glance over the side of the aeroplane，and saw the landscape from its great height．

I looked out for Denys on Thursday，and reckoned that he would fly from Voi at sunrise and be two hours on the way to Ngong．But when he did not come，and I found that I had got things to do in Nairobi，I drove in to town．

Whenever I was ill in Africa，or much worried，I suffered from a special kind of compulsive idea．It seemed to me then that all my surroundings were in danger or distress，and that in the midst of this disaster I myself was somehow on the wrong side，and therefore was regarded with distrust and fear by everybody．

This nightmare was in reality a reminiscence of the time of the war．For then for a couple of years，people in the Colony had believed me to be a pro-German at heart，and had looked at me with mistrust．Their suspiciousness rose from the fact that I had，in the innocence of my heart，a short time before the outbreak of war，been up at Naivasha buying horses for General von Lettow down in German East Africa．He had asked me，when we travelled out to Africa together six months before，to buy him ten Abyssinian breeding-mares，but during my first time in the country I had had other things to think of，and had forgotten about it，so that it was only later，when he kept on writing of the mares to me，that in the end I went up to Naivasha to buy them for him．The war broke out so shortly after，that the mares never got out of the country．Still I could not get away from the fact that I had，at the outbreak of the war，been buying up horses for the German army．The suspicion against me did not，however，last till the end of the war，it passed away when my brother，who had been volunteering with the English，got the V．C．in the Amiens push，north of Roye．That event was even announced in the East African Standard under the headline of：An East-African V．C．

At the time，I had taken my isolation lightly，for I was not in the least pro-German，and I thought that I should be able to clear things up if it became necessary．But it must have gone deeper with me than I knew of，and for many years after，when I was very tired or when I had a high temperature，the feeling of it would come back．During my last months in Africa，when everything was going wrong with me，it sometimes suddenly fell upon me like a darkness，and in a way I was frightened of it，as of a sort of derangement．

On this Thursday in Nairobi the nightmare unexpectedly stole upon me，and grew so strong that I wondered if I were beginning to go mad．There was，somehow，a deep sadness over the town，and over the people I met，and in the midst of it everybody was turning away from me．There was nobody who would stop and talk to me：my friends，when they saw me，got into their cars and drove off．Even old Mr．Duncan，the Scotch grocer，from whom I had bought groceries for many years，and with whom I had danced at a big ball at Government House，when I came in looked at me with a kind of fright and left his shop．I began to feel as lonely in Nairobi as on a desert island．

I had left Farah on the farm to receive Denys，so that I had nobody to talk with．The Kikuyus are no good in such a case，for their ideas of reality，and their reality itself，are different from ours．But I was to lunch with Lady McMillan at Chiromo，and I thought that there I should find white people to talk to，and get back my balance of mind．

I drove up to the lovely old Nairobi house of Chiromo，at the end of the long bamboo avenue，and found a luncheon party there．But it was the same thing at Chiromo as in the streets of Nairobi．Everybody seemed mortally sad，and as I came in the talk stopped．I sat beside my old friend Mr．Bulpett，and he looked down and said only a few words．I tried to throw off the shadow that was by now lying heavily upon me，and to talk to him of his mountain-climbings in Mexico，but he seemed to remember nothing about them．

I thought：These people are no good to me，I will go back to the farm．Denys will be there by now．We will talk and behave sensibly，and I shall be sane again and know and understand everything．

But when we had finished luncheon，Lady McMillan asked me to come with her into her small sitting-room，and there told me that there had been an accident at Voi．Denys had capsized with his machine，and had been killed in the fall．

It was then as I had thought：at the sound of Denys's name even，truth was revealed，and I knew and understood everything．

Later on，the District Commissioner at Voi wrote to me and gave me the particulars of the accident．Denys had been staying with him over the night，and had left from the aerodrome in the morning，with his boy in the aeroplane with him，for my farm．After he had left he turned and came back quickly，flying low，at two hundred feet．Suddenly the aeroplane swayed，got into a spin，and came down like a bird swooping．As it hit the ground it caught fire，the people who ran to it were stopped by the heat．When they got branches and earth，and had thrown them on the fire，and had got it out，they found that the aeroplane had been all smashed up，and the two people in it had been killed in the fall．

For many years after this day the Colony felt Denys's death as a loss which could not be recovered．Something fine then came out in the average colonist's attitude towards him，a reverence for values outside their understanding．When they spoke of him it was most often as an athlete；they would discuss his exploits as a cricketer and a golfer，and of these things I had never heard myself，so that it was only now that I learned of his great fame in all games．Then when the people had been paying tribute to him as a sportsman，they would add that，of course，he had been very brilliant．What they really remembered in him was his absolute lack of self-consciousness，or self-interest，an unconditional truthfulness which outside of him I have only met in idiots．In a colony，these qualities are not generally held up for imitation，but after a man's death they may be，perhaps，more truly admired than in other places．

The Natives had known Denys better than the white people；to them his death was a bereavement．

When，in Nairobi，I was told of Denys's death I tried to get down to Voi．The Airway Company was sending down Tom Black to report on the accident，and I drove to the aerodrome to ask him to take me with him，but as I got into the aerodrome，his aeroplane lifted and sailed off，towards Voi．

It might still be possible to get through by car，but the long rains were on，and I had to find out what the roads were like．While I sat and waited for the report on the roads，I remembered how Denys had told me that he wished to be buried in the Ngong Hills．It was a strange thing that I had not recollected it before，but it had been so far from my thoughts that they should mean to bury him at all．Now it was as if a picture had been shown to me．

There was a place in the hills，on the first ridge in the Game Reserve，that I myself，at the time when I thought that I was to live and die in Africa，had pointed out to Denys as my future burial-place．In the evening，while we sat and looked at the hills，from my house，he remarked that then he would like to be buried there himself as well．Since then，sometimes when we drove out in the hills，Denys had said：“Let us drive as far as our graves．”Once when we were camped in the hills to look for buffalo，we had in the afternoon walked over to the slope to have a closer look at it．There was an infinitely great view from there；in the light of the sunset we saw both Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro．Denys had been eating an orange，lying in the grass，and had said that he would like to stay there．My own burial-place was a little higher up．From both places we could see my house in the forest far away to the east．We were going back there the next day，for ever，I thought，in spite of the widespread theory that all must die．

Gustav Mohr had come from his farm to my house，when he heard of Denys's death，and when he did not find me there he looked me up in Nairobi．A little while after，Hugh Martin came and sat down with us．I told them of Denys's wish，and of the burial-place in the hills，and they wired to the people at Voi．Before I went back to the farm they informed me that they would bring Denys's body up by train next morning，so that the funeral could take place in the hills at noon．I must have his grave ready there by then．

Gustav Mohr went with me to the farm，to sleep there，and help me in the morning．We would have to be out in the hills just before sunrise to decide on the place，and to have the grave dug in time．

It rained all night，and there was a fine drizzling rain in the morning when we went away．The wagon-tracks on the road were full of water．Driving up in the hills was like driving into clouds．We could not see the plains below to our left，nor the slopes or peaks of the hills to our right；the boys who came with us in a lorry disappeared behind us at a distance of ten yards，and the mist grew thicker as the road mounted．By the signboard on the road，we found where we got into the Game Reserve，so we drove on a few hundred yards and then got out of the car．We left the lorry，and the boys，on the highroad，until we should have found the place we wanted．The morning air was so cold that it bit the fingers．

The place of the grave must not be too far away from the road nor where the ground was too steep to bring up a lorry．We walked together for a little while，talking of the mist，then we parted and went along by different paths，and after a few seconds we could no longer see one another．

The great country of the hills opened up reluctantly round me，and closed again，the day was like a rainy day in a northern country．Farah was walking with me with a wet rifle；he thought that we might walk into a herd of buffalo．The things close by，that suddenly appeared just before us，looked fantastically big．The leaves of the grey wild-olive bush，and the long grass，higher than ourselves，were dripping wet and smelled strongly—I had on a mackintosh and rubber boots，but after a while I was drenched，as if I had been wading up a stream．It was very still here in the hills；only at times when the rain came down stronger，there was a whisper to all sides．Once the mist parted，and I saw a stretch of indigo blue land before me and beyond me，like a slate—it must have been one of the tall peaks far away—a moment after it was again covered by the drifting grey rain and mist．I walked and walked，and in the end I stood quite still．There was nothing to do here until the weather cleared up．

Gustav Mohr shouted to me three or four times to find out where I was，and came up to me，the rain on his face and hands．He told me that we had been going about in the mist for an hour，and that if we did not settle the place for the grave now，we would not have it ready in time．

“But I cannot see where we are，”I said，“and we cannot lay him where the ridges close up the view．Let us wait a little longer．”

We stood in silence in the long grass，and I smoked a cigarette．Just as I was throwing it away，the mist spread a little，and a pale cold clarity began to fill the world．In ten minutes we could see where we were．The plains lay below us，and I could follow the road by which we had come，as it wound in and out along the slopes，climbed towards us，and，winding，went on．To the south far away below the changing clouds，lay the broken，dark blue foot hills of Kilimanjaro．As we turned to the north the light increased；pale rays for a moment slanted in the sky and a streak of shining silver drew up the shoulder of Mount Kenya．Suddenly，much closer，to the east below us，was a little red spot in the grey and green，the only red there was，the tiled roof of my house on its cleared place in the forest．We did not have to go any further，we were in the right place．A little while after，the rain started again．

About twenty yards higher up than where we stood，there was a narrow natural terrace in the hillside．Here we marked out the place for the grave，by the compass，laying it east to west．We called up the boys，and set them to cut the grass with pangas，and to dig the wet soil．Mohr took some of them with him to make a road tor the lorry，from the high road to the grave；they levelled out the ground，cut off branches from the bush and heaped them on the path，for the ground was slippery．We could not bring the road all the way up to the grave，near it the ground was too steep．It had been silent up here till now，but when the boys began to work，I heard that there was an echo in the hills，it answered to the strokes of the spades，like a little dog barking．

Some cars came out from Nairobi，and we sent down a boy to show them the way，for in the great country they would not notice the small group of people by the grave in the bush．The Somalis of Nairobi came out，they left their mule-traps on the highroad，and walked slowly up，three or four together，mourning in the Somali way，as if wrapping up their heads and withdrawing from life．Some of Denys's friends from up-country，who had had news of his death，came driving from Naivasha，Gil-Gil，and Elmenteita，their cars all covered with mud from the long fast drive．Now the day grew clearer，and the four tall peaks of the hills showed above us against the sky．

Here in the early afternoon they brought out Denys from Nairobi，following his old safari-track to Tanganyika，and driving slowly on the wet road．When they came to the last steep slope，they lifted out and carried the narrow coffin，that was covered with the flag．As it was placed in the grave，the country changed and became the setting for it，as still as itself，the hills stood up gravely，they knew and understood what we were doing in them；after a little while they themselves took charge of the ceremony，it was an action between them and him，and the people present became a party of very small lookers on in the landscape．

Denys had watched and followed all the ways of the African highlands，and better than any other white man he had known their soil and seasons，the vegetation and the wild animals，the winds and smells．He had observed the changes of weather in them，their people，clouds，the stars at night．Here in the hills，I had seen him only a short time ago，standing bare headed in the afternoon sun，gazing out over the land，and lifting his field-glasses to find out everything about it．He had taken in the country，and in his eyes and his mind it had been changed，marked by his own individuality，and made part of him．Now Africa received him，and would change him，and make him one with herself．

The Bishop of Nairobi，I was told，had not wanted to come out，because there had not been time to have the burial ground consecrated，but there was another clergyman present，who read out the funeral service，which I had never heard before，and in the great space his voice sounded small and clear，like the voice of a bird in the hills．I thought that Denys would like the whole thing best when it was over．The priest read out a Psalm：“I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills．”

Gustav Mohr and I sat on for a little while，after the other white people had left．The Mohammedans waited till we had gone，and then went and prayed by the grave．

In the days after Denys's death，his safari servants came in，and gathered on the farm．They did not say why they came，and did not ask for anything，but sat down with their backs to the wall of the house，and the backs of their hands，resting upon the pavement，most of the time in silence，contrary to the habits of Natives．Malimu and Sar Sita came there，Denys's bold，shrewd，fearless gunbearers and trackers，who had been with him on all his safaris．They had been out with the Prince of Wales，and many years after，the Prince remembered their names，and said that the two of them together had been hard to beat．Here the great trackers had lost the track，and sat immovable．Kanuthia，his motor-driver，came in，who had driven over many thousand miles of rough country，a slim young Kikuyu with the watchful eyes of a monkey；now he sat by the house like a sad and chilly monkey in a cage．

Bilea Isa，Denys's Somali servant，came down from Naivasha to the farm．Bilea had been to England twice with Denys，had been to school there，and spoke English like a gentleman．Some years ago，Denys and I had attended Bilea's wedding in Nairobi；it was a magnificent feast that lasted for seven days．On that occasion，the great traveller and scholar had gone back to the ways of his ancestors；he had been dressed in a golden robe，and had bowed down to the ground when he welcomed us，and he danced the sword-dance，all wild with the desperado spirit of the desert．Bilea came down to see his master's grave，and sit on it；he came back from it and spoke very little，after a little while，he sat with the others with his back to the wall，and the backs of his hands resting on the pavement．

Farah went out and stood and talked with the mourners．He himself was very grave．“It would not have been so bad，”he said to me，“that you were going away from the country，if only Bedâr had still been here．”

Denys's boys stayed for about a week，then one after the other they left again．

I often drove out to Denys's grave．In a bee-line，it was not more than five miles from my house，but round by the road it was fifteen．The grave was a thousand feet higher up than my house，the air was different here，as clear as a glass of water；light sweet winds lifted your hair when you took off your hat；over the peaks of the hills，the clouds came wandering from the east，drew their live shadow over the wide undulating land，and were dissolved and disappeared over the Rift Valley．

I bought at the duca a yard of the white cloth which the Natives call Americani，and Farah and I raised three tall poles in the ground behind the grave，and nailed the cloth on to them，then from my house I could distinguish the exact spot of the grave，like a little white point in the green hill．

The long rains had been heavy，and I was afraid that the grass would grow up and cover the grave so that its place would be lost．Therefore one day we took up all the whitewashed stones along my drive，the same that Karomenya had had trouble in pulling up and carrying to the front door；we loaded them into my boxbody car and drove them up into the hills．We cut down the grass round the grave，and set the stones in a square to mark it；now the place could always be found．

As I went so often to the grave，and took the children of my household with me，it became a familiar place to them；they could show the way out there to the people who came to see it．They built a small bower in the bush of the hill near it．In the course of the summer，Ali bin Salim，whose friend Denys had been，came from Mombasa to go out and lie on the grave and weep，in the Arab way．

One day I found Hugh Martin by the grave，and we sat in the grass and talked for a long time．Hugh Martin had taken Denys's death much to heart．If any human being at all had held a place in his queer seclusive existence，it would have been Denys．An ideal is a strange thing，you would never have given Hugh credit for harbouring the idea of one，neither would you have thought that the loss of it would have affected him，like，somehow，the loss of a vital organ．But since Denys's death he had aged and changed much，his face was blotched and drawn．All the same he preserved his placid，smiling likeness to a Chinese Idol，as if he knew of something exceedingly satisfactory，that was hidden to the general．He told me now that he had，in the night，suddenly struck upon the right epitaph for Denys．I think that he had got it from an ancient Greek author，he quoted it to me in Greek，then translated it in order that I should understand it．It went：“Though in death fire be mixed with my dust yet care I not．For with me now all is well．”

Later on，Denys's brother，Lord Winchilsea，had an obelisk set on his grave，with an inscription out of“The Ancient Mariner”，which was a poem that Denys had much admired．I myself had never heard it until Denys quoted it to me—the first time was，I remember，as we were going to Bilea's wedding．I have not seen the obelisk；it was put up after I had left Africa．

In England there is also a monument to Denys．His old schoolfellows，in memory of him，built a stone bridge over a small stream between two fields at Eton．On one of the balustrades is inscribed his name，and the dates of his stay at Eton，and on the other the words：“Famous in these fields and by his many friends much beloved．”

Between the river in the mellow English landscape and the African mountain ridge，ran the path of his life；it is an optical illusion that it seemed to wind and swerve—the surroundings swerved．The bowstring was released on the bridge at Eton，the arrow described its orbit，and hit the obelisk in the Ngong Hills．

After I had left Africa，Gustav Mohr wrote to me of a strange thing that had happened by Denys' grave，the like of which I have never heard．“The Masai，”he wrote，“have reported to the District Commissioner at Ngong，that many times，at sunrise and sunset，they have seen lions on Finch-Hatton's grave in the Hills．A lion and a lioness have come there，and stood，or lain，on the grave for a long time．Some of the Indians who have passed the place in their lorries on the way to Kajado have also seen them．After you went away，the ground round the grave was levelled out，into a sort of big terrace，I suppose that the level place makes a good site for the lions，from there they can have a view over the plain，and the cattle and game on it．”

It was fit and decorous that the lions should come to Denys's grave and make him an African monument．“And renowned be thy grave．”Lord Nelson himself，I have reflected，in Trafalgar Square，has his lions made only out of stone．





Farah and I Sell out


Now I was alone on the farm．It was no longer mine，but the people who had bought it had offered me to stay in the house as long as I liked，and for legal reasons were leasing it to me for a shilling a day．

I was selling my furniture，which gave Farah and me a good deal to do．We had to have all the china and table-glass on view upon the dinner table；later on，when the table had been sold，we arranged it in long rows on the floor．The cuckoo of the clock sang out the hours arrogantly over the rows，then it was itself sold，and flew off．One day I sold my table-glass，and then in the night thought better of it，so that in the morning I drove to Nairobi and asked the lady who had bought it to call off the deal．I had no place to put the glass，but the fingers and lips of many friends had touched it，they had given me excellent wine to drink out of it；it was keeping an echo of old table-talk，and I did not want to part with it．After all，I thought，it would be an easy thing to break．

I had an old wooden screen with painted figures of Chinamen，Sultans and Negroes，with dogs on leads，which had had its place by the fire．There in the evenings，when the fire burned clear，the figures would come out，and serve as illustrations to the tales that I told Denys．After I had looked at it for a long time，I folded it up and packed it in a case，wherein the figures might all have a rest for the time being．

Lady McMillan was at this time finishing the McMillan Memorial of Nairobi，that she had built to her husband，Sir Northrup McMillan．It was a fine building，with a library and reading rooms．She now drove out to the farm，sat and talked sadly of old days，and bought most of my old Danish furniture，that I had taken out from home with me，for the library．I was pleased to know that the cheerful，wise and hospitable chests and cabinets were to remain together，in a milieu of books and scholars，like a small circle of ladies who，in times of revolution，find an asylum in a University．

My own books I packed up in cases and sat on them，or dined on them．Books in a colony play a different part in your existence from what they do in Europe；there is a whole side of your life which there they alone take charge of；and on this account，according to their quality，you feel more grateful to them，or more indignant with them，than you will ever do in civilized countries．

The fictitious characters in the books run beside your horse on the farm，and walk about in the maize fields．On their own，like intelligent soldiers，they find at once the quarters that suit them．On the morning after I had been reading Crome Yellow at night—and I had never heard of the author's name，but had picked up the book in a Nairobi bookshop，and was as pleased as if I had discovered a new green island in the sea—as I was riding through a valley of the Game Reserve，a little duiker jumped up，and at once turned himself into a stag for Sir．Hercules with his wife and his pack of thirty black and fawn coloured pugs．All Walter Scott's characters were at home in the country and might be met anywhere；so were Odysseus and his men，and strangely enough many figures from Racine．Peter Schlemihl had walked over the hills in seven-league boots，Clown Agheb the honey-bee lived in my garden by the river．

Other things were sold out of the house，packed and sent off，so that the house，in the course of these months，became das Ding an sich，noble like a skull，a cool and roomy place to dwell in，with an echo to it，and the grass of the lawn growing long up to the doorstep．In the end there were no things in the rooms at all，and to my mind at the time they seemed，in this state，more fit to live in than they had been before．

I said to Farah，“This is how we ought to have had it all the time．”

Farah understood me very well，for all Somali have something of the ascetic in them．Farah during this time was set and concentrated upon assisting me in everything；but he was growing to look more and more like a true Somali，such as he had looked in Aden，where he had been sent to meet me，when I first came to Africa．He was much concerned about my old shoes，and confided to me that he was going to pray to God every day that they might last until I got to Paris．

During these months，Farah wore his best clothes every day．He had a lot of fine clothes：gold-embroidered Arab waistcoats that I had given him，and a very elegant scarlet gold-laced uniform waistcoat that Berkeley Cole had given him，and silk turbans in beautiful colours．Generally he kept them all in chests，and wore them only on special occasions．But now he put on the best he had．He walked one step behind me in the streets of Nairobi，or waited on the dirty stairs in the government buildings and the lawyer's offices，dressed like Solomon in all his glory．It took a Somali to do that．

I had now also got to deal with the fate of my horses and my dogs．I had all the time meant to shoot them，but many of my friends wrote to me and asked me to let them have them．After that，whenever I rode out and had the dogs with me，it did not seem fair on them to shoot them—they had much life in them still．It took me a long time to decide the matter，I do not think that I have ever changed my mind so often over any other question．In the end I decided to give them to my friends．

I rode into Nairobi on my favourite horse，Rouge，going very slowly and looking round to the north and the south．It was a very strange thing to Rouge，I thought，to be going in by the Nairobi road，and not to be coming back．I installed him，with some trouble，in the horse-van of the Naivasha train，I stood in the van and felt，for the last time，his silky muzzle against my hands and my face．I will not let thee go，Rouge，except thou bless me．We had found together the riding-path down to the river amongst the Native shambas and huts，on the steep slippery descent he had walked as nimbly as a mule，and in the brown running river-water I had seen my own head and his close together．May you now，in a valley of clouds，eat carnations to the right and stock to the left．

The two young deerhounds that I had then，David and Dinah，Pania's offspring，I gave to a friend on a farm near Gil-Gil，where they would get good hunting．They were very strong and playful，and when they were fetched in a car and drove off from the farm in great style，they panted，their heads close together over the side of the car，their tongues hanging out，as if they were on the track of a new splendid kind of game．The quick eyes and feet，and the live hearts，went away from the house and the plains，to breathe and sniff，and run happily on new grounds．

Some of my people now left the farm．As there was to be no coffee and no coffee-mill there any longer，Pooran Singh found himself out of work．He did not want to take on another job in Africa，and in the end he made up his mind to go back to India．

Pooran Singh，who mastered the minerals，outside of his workshop was like a child．He could not in the least realize that the end of the farm had come；he grieved over it，wept clear tears that ran down in his black beard，and for a long time worried me with his attempts to make me remain on the farm，and with his plans for keeping it going．He had taken much pride in our machinery，such as it was，and was now for a while as if nailed to the steam-engine and the coffee-dryer in the factory，his soft dark eyes consuming every nut in them．Then，when in the end he had been convinced of the hopelessness of the situation，he gave it all up in one movement，he was still very sad，but quite passive，and sometimes when I saw him he talked much to me of his travelling plans．When he went away，he carried no luggage with him but a small box of tools and soldering outfit，as if he had already sent his heart and life over the ocean，and there was now only his thin，unassuming，brown person and the soldering pan to follow it．

I wanted to give Pooran Singh a present before he left，and I had hoped that I might have something in my possession which he would like，but when I spoke to him of it he at once with great joy declared that he wanted a ring．I had no ring and no money to buy him one．This had happened already some months ago，at the time when Denys was coming out to dine at the farm，and so at dinner I told him of the position．Denys had once given me an Abyssinian ring of soft gold，to be screwed on so that it would fit any finger．He now thought that I was looking at it with the intention of giving it to Pooran Singh，for he used to complain that whenever he gave me anything I would at once give it away to my coloured people．To prevent such a thing happening，he took it from my hand and put it on his own and said that he would keep it until Pooran Singh had gone．It was a few days before he went to Mombasa，and in this way the ring was buried with him．Before Pooran Singh left I had，however，raised enough money by the sale of my furniture to buy him the ring he wanted in Nairobi．It was of heavy gold with a big red stone，that looked like glass．Pooran Singh was so happy about it that he shed a few tears again，and I believe that the ring helped him over his final parting with the farm and with his machinery．For his last week，he wore it every day，and whenever he came to the house，he held up his hand，and showed it to me with a radiant，gentle smile．At Nairobi station，the last thing that I saw of him was this slim dark hand，that had worked on the forge with such furious speed．It was stretched out through the window of the crowded and overheated Native railway carriage，in which Pooran Singh had placed himself upon his tool-box，and the red stone in it shone like a little star while it went up and down，waving good-bye．

Pooran Singh went to the Punjab to his family．He had not seen them for many years，but they had kept in touch with him by sending him photographs of themselves，which he preserved down in his little corrugated iron house by the factory，and showed to me with great tenderness and pride．I had several letters from Pooran Singh already from the boat to India．They all began in the same way：“Dear Madam．Good-bye，”and then went on to give me his news and to report on his adventures of the journey．

A week after Denys's death one morning a strange thing happened to me．

I lay in bed and thought of the events of the last months，I tried to understand what it really was that had happened．It seemed to me that I must have，in some way，got out of the normal course of human existence，into a maelstrom where I ought never to have been．Wherever I walked，the ground fell away under me，and the stars fell from the sky．I thought of the poem about Ragnarok，in which this fall of the stars is described，and of the verses about the dwarfs who sigh deeply in their caves in the mountains，and die from fear．All this could not be，I thought，just a coincidence of circumstances，what people call a run of bad luck，but there must be some central principle within it．If I could find it，it would save me．If I looked in the right place，I reflected，the coherence of things might become clear to me．I must，I thought，get up and look for a sign．

Many people think it an unreasonable thing，to be looking for a sign．This is because of the fact that it takes a particular state of mind to be able to do so，and not many people have ever found themselves in such a state．If in this mood，you ask for a sign，the answer cannot fail you；it follows as the natural consequence of the demand．In that same way an inspired card-player collects thirteen chance cards on the table，and takes up what is called a hand of cards—a unity．Where others see no call at all，he sees a grand slam staring him in the face．Is there a grand slam in the cards？Yes，to the right player．

I came out of the house looking for a sign，and wandered at haphazard towards the boys' huts．They had just let out their chickens，which were running here and there amongst the houses．I stood for a little while and looked at them．

Fathima's big white cock came strutting up before me．Suddenly he stopped，laid his head first on one side and then on the other，and raised his comb．From the other side of the path，out of the grass，came a little grey chameleon that was，like the cock himself，out on his morning reconnoitring．The cock walked straight upon it—for the chickens eat these things—and gave out a few clucks of satisfaction．The chameleon stopped up dead at the sight of the cock．He was frightened，but he was at the same time very brave，he planted his feet in the ground，opened his mouth as wide as he possibly could，and to scare his enemy，in a flash he shot out his club-shaped tongue at the cock．The cock stood for a second as if taken aback，then swiftly and determinately he struck down his beak like a hammer and plucked out the chameleon's tongue．

The whole meeting between the two had taken ten seconds．Now I chased off Fathima's cock，took up a big stone and killed the chameleon，for he could not live without his tongue；the chameleons catch the insects that they feed on with their tongue．

I was so frightened by what I had seen—for it had been a gruesome and formidable thing in a miniature format—that I went away and sat down on the stone seat by the house．I sat there for a long time，and Farah brought me out my tea，and put it on the table．I looked down on the stones and dared not look up，such a dangerous place did the world seem to me．

Very slowly only，in the course of the next few days，it came upon me that I had had the most spiritual answer possible to my call．I had even been in a strange manner honoured and distinguished．The powers to which I had cried had stood on my dignity more than I had done myself，and what other answer could they then give？This was clearly not the hour for coddling，and they had chosen to connive at my invocation of it．Great powers had laughed to me，with an echo from the hills to follow the laughter，they had said among the trumpets，among the cocks and chameleons，Ha ha！

I was so pleased that I had been out this morning in time to save the chameleon from a slow，painful death．




It was about this time—although it was before I had sent away my horses—that Ingrid Lindstrom came down from her farm at Njoro to stay with me for a little while．This was a friendly act of Ingrid's，for it was difficult to her to get away from her own farm．Her husband，to make money to pay off their Njoro land，had taken a job with a big Sisal company in Tanganyika，and was at the same time sweating down there at an altitude of two thousand feet，just as if Ingrid had been leasing him out in the quality of a slave，for the sake of the farm．She was therefore，in the meantime，running it on her own；she had extended her poultry yards，and her market garden，and had got pigs，and broods of young turkeys up there，which she could ill afford to leave，even for a few days．All the same，for my sake she gave it all in charge of Kemosa，and rushed down to me as she would run to the assistance of a friend whose house was on fire，and she came without Kemosa this time，which was probably，under the circumstances，a good thing for Farah．Ingrid understood and realized to the bottom of her heart，with great strength，with something of the strength of the elements themselves，what it is really like，when a woman farmer has to give up her farm，and leave it．

While Ingrid was staying with me，we did not discuss either the past or the future，and did not mention the name of a single friend or acquaintance；we closed our two minds round the disaster of the hour．We walked together from the one thing on the farm to the other，naming them as we passed them，one by one，as if we were taking mental stock of my loss，or as if Ingrid were，on my behalf，collecting material for a book of complaints to be laid before destiny．Ingrid knew well enough from her own experience that there is no such book，but all the same the idea of it forms part of the livelihood of women．

We went down to the oxen's boma，and sat on the fence，counting the oxen as they came in．Without words I pointed them out to Ingrid：“These oxen，”and without words she responded：“Yes，these oxen，”and recorded them in her book．We went round to the stables to feed the horses with sugar，and when they had finished it，I stretched out my sticky and be slabbered palms，presenting them to Ingrid and crying，“These horses．”Ingrid sighed back laboriously，“Yes，these horses，”and noted them down．In my garden by the river she could not reconcile herself to the idea that I must leave the plants that I had brought from Europe；she wrung her hands over the mint，sage and lavender，and talked of them again later on，as if she were pondering on some scheme by which I might arrange to take them with me．

We spent the afternoons in contemplation of my small herd of Native cows which grazed on the lawn．I went through their age，characteristics，and yielding of milk，and Ingrid groaned and shrieked over the figures as if she had been bodily hurt．She scrutinized them carefully one by one，not with any view to trade，for my cows were going to my houseboys，but so as to value and weigh up my loss．She clung to the soft sweet smelling calves；she had herself after long struggles got a few cows with calves on her farm，and against all reason，and against her own will，her deep furious glances blamed me for deserting my calves．

A man who was walking beside a bereaved friend and who was all the time in his own mind repeating the words：“Thank God it is not me，”would，I believe，feel badly about it，and would try to suppress the feeling．It is a different thing in two women who are friends，and of whom the one is manifesting her deep sympathy in the distress of the other．There it goes without saying that the more fortunate friend will all the while in her heart repeat the same thing：“Thank God it is not me．”It causes no bad feeling between the two，but on the contrary brings them closer together，and gives to the ceremony a personal element．Men，I think，cannot easily or harmoniously envy or triumph over one another．But it goes without saying that the bride triumphs over the bridesmaids，and that the lying in-visitors envy the mother of the child；and none of the parties feel the worse on that account．A woman who had lost a child might show its clothes to a friend，aware that the friend was repeating in her heart：“Thank God it is not me，”—and it would be to both of them a natural and befitting thing．It was so with Ingrid and me．As we walked over the farm，I knew that she was thinking of her own farm，praising her luck that it was still hers，and holding on to it with all her might，and we got on very well on that．In spite of our old khaki coats and trousers，we were in reality a pair of mythical women，shrouded respectively in white and black，a unity，the Genii of the farmer's life in Africa．

After a few days Ingrid said good-bye to me，and went up by the railway to Njoro．




I could no longer ride out，and my walks without the dogs had become very silent and sedate，but I still had my car，and I was glad to have her，for in these months I had much to do．

The fate of my squatters weighed on my mind．As the people who had bought the farm were planning to take up the coffee-trees，and to have the land cut up and sold as building-plots，they had no use for the squatters，and as soon as the deal was through，they had given them all six months' notice to get off the farm．This to the squatters was an unforeseen and bewildering determination，for they had lived in the illusion that the land was theirs．Many of them had been born on the farm，and others had come there as small children with their fathers．

The squatters knew that in order to stay on the land they had got to work for me one hundred and eighty days out of each year，for which they were paid twelve shillings for every thirty days；these accounts were kept at the office of the farm．They also knew that they must pay the hut-tax to the government，of twelve shillings to a hut，a heavy burden on a man，who with very little else in the world would own two or three grass-huts—according to the number of his wives，for a Kikuyu husband must give each of his wives her own hut．My squatters had，from time to time，been threatened to be turned off the farm for an offence，so that they must in some way have felt that their position was not entirely unassailable．The hut-tax they much disliked，and when I collected it on the farm for the government，they gave me a great deal to do，and much talk to listen to．But they had still looked upon these things as common vicissitudes of life，and had never given up the hope of somehow getting round them．They had not imagined that there might be，to them all，an underlying universal principle，which would at its own hour manifest itself in a fatal，crushing manner．For some time they chose to regard the decision of the new owners of the farm as a bugbear，which they could courageously ignore．

In some respects，although not in all，the white men fill in the mind of the Natives the place that is，in the mind of the white men，filled by the idea of God．I once had a contract drawn up with an Indian timber-merchant，it contained the words：an act of God．I was not familiar with the expression，and the lawyer who was drawing up the contract tried to explain it to me．

“No，no，Madam，”he said，“you have not quite caught the meaning of the term．What is completely unforeseeable，and not consonant with rule or reason，that is an act of God．”

In the end，the certainty of their notice to quit brought the squatters in dark groups to my house．They felt the denunciation as a consequence of my departure from the farm—my own bad luck was growing，and was spreading over them as well．They did not blame me for it，for that was talked out between us；they asked me where they were to go．

I found it，in more than one way，difficult to answer them．The Natives cannot，according to the law，themselves buy any land，and there was not another farm that I knew of，big enough to take them on as squatters．I told them that I had myself been told when I had made inquiries in the matter，that they must go into the Kikuyu Reserve and find land there．On that they again gravely asked me if they should find enough unoccupied land in the Reserve to bring all their cattle with them？And，they went on，would they be sure all to find land in the same place，so that the people from the farm should remain together，for they did not want to be separated？

I was surprised that they should be so determined to stay together，for on the farm they had found it difficult to keep peace，and had never had much good to say of one another．Still，here they all came，the big swaggering cattle-owners like Kathegu，Kaninu，and Mauge，hand in hand，so to say，with the humble unportioned workers of the soil like Waweru and Chotha，who did not own so much as one goat；and they were all filled with the same spirit，and as intent upon keeping one another as on keeping their cows．I felt that they were not only asking me for a place to live on，but that they were demanding their existence of me．

It is more than their land that you take away from the people，whose native land you take．It is their past as well，their roots and their identity．If you take away the things that they have been used to see，and will be expecting to see，you may，in a way，as well take their eyes．This applies in a higher degree to the primitive people than to the civilized，and animals again will wander back a long way，and go through danger and sufferings，to recover their lost identity，in the surroundings that they know．

The Masai when they were moved from their old country，north of the railway line，to the present Masai Reserve，took with them the names of their hills，plains，and rivers；and gave them to the hills，plains，and rivers in the new country．It is a bewildering thing to the traveller．The Masai were carrying their cut roots with them as a medicine，and were trying，in exile，to keep their past by a formula．

Now，my squatters were clinging to one another from the same instinct of self-preservation．If they were to go away from their land，they must have people round them who had known it，and so could testify to their identity．Then they could still，for some years，talk of the geography and the history of the farm，and what one had forgotten the other would remember．As it was，they were feeling the shame of extinction falling on them．

“Go Msabu，”they said to me，“go for us to the Selikali，and obtain from them that we may take all our cattle with us to the new place and that we shall all remain together where we are going．”

With this began for me a long pilgrimage，or beggar's journey，which took up my last months in Africa．

On the Kikuyu's errand I first went to the District Commissioners of Nairobi and Kiambu，then to the Native Department and the Land Office，and in the end to the Governor，Sir Joseph Byrne，whom I had not met till then，for he was only just out from England．In the end I forgot what I went for．I was washed in and out as by the tide．Sometimes I had to stay for a whole day in Nairobi，or to go in two or three times in a day．There were always a number of squatters stationed by my house，when I came back，but they never asked me for my news；they kept watch there in order to communicate to me，by some Native magic，stamina on the course．

The government officials were patient and obliging people．The difficulties in the matter were not of their making：it was really a problem to find，in the Kikuyu Reserve，an unoccupied stretch of land big enough to take in the full number of the people and their cattle．

Most of the officials had been in the country for a long time，and knew the Natives well．They would only vaguely suggest the resource of making the Kikuyu sell out some of their stock．For they knew that under no circumstances would they do so，and by bringing their herds on to a place that was too small for them，they would cause，in years to come，endless trouble with their neighbours in the Reserve，for other District Commissioners up there to go into，and settle．

But when we came to the second request of the squatters，that they should remain together，the people in authority said that there was no real need for that．

“Oh reason not the need，”I thought，“our basest beggars are in the poorest things superfluous”—and so on．All my life I have held that you can class people according to how they may be imagined behaving to King Lear．You could not reason with King Lear，any more than with an old Kikuyu，and from the first he demanded too much of everybody；but he was a king．It is true that the African Native has not handed over his country to the white man in a magnificent gesture，so that the case is in some ways different from that of the old king and his daughters；the white men took over the country as a Protectorate．But I bore in mind that not very long ago，at a time that could still be remembered，the Natives of the country had held their land undisputed，and had never heard of the white men and their laws．Within the general insecurity of their existence the land to them was still steadfast．Some of them were carried off by the slave-traders and were sold at slave-markets，but some of them always remained．Those who were taken away，in their exile and thraldom all over the eastern world，would long back to the highlands，for that was their own land．The old dark clear-eyed Native of Africa，and the old dark clear-eyed elephant—they are alike；you see them standing on the ground，weighty with such impressions of the world around them as have been slowly gathered and heaped up in their dim minds；they are themselves features of the land．Either one of the two might find himself quite perplexed by the sight of the great changes that are going on all round him，and might ask you where he was，and you would have to answer him in the words of Kent：“In your own kingdom，Sir．”

In the end，just as I was beginning to feel that I must drive in to Nairobi and back，and talk on in government offices all my life，I was suddenly informed that my application had been granted．The government had agreed to give out a piece of the Dagoretti Forest Reserve to the squatters of my farm．Here they could form a settlement of their own，not far from their old place，and after the disappearance of the farm they could still preserve their faces and their names，as a community．

The news of this decision was received on the farm with deep silent emotion．It was impossible to tell from the faces of the Kikuyu whether they had all the time had faith in this issue of the case，or whether they had despaired of it．As soon as it was settled，they immediately entered on a course of multifarious complicated requests and propositions that I refused to deal with．They still stayed on by my house，watching me in a novel way．Natives have such feeling for，and faith in，fortune，that now，after our one success，they may have begun to trust that all was going to be well，and that I was to stay on the farm．

As for me myself，the settlement of the squatters' fate was a great appeasement to me．I have not often felt so contented．

Then，after two or three days，the feeling came upon me that my work in the country had been brought to an end and that now I might go．The coffee harvest on the farm was finished，and the mill standing still，the house was empty，the squatters had got their land．The rains were over，and the new grass was already long on the plains and in the hills．

The plan which I had formed in the beginning，to give in in all minor matters，so as to keep what was of vital importance to me，had turned out to be a failure．I had consented to give away my possessions one by one，as a kind of ransom for my own life，but by the time that I had nothing left，I myself was the lightest thing of all，for fate to get rid of．

There was a full moon in those days，it shone into the bare room and laid the pattern of the windows on the floor．I thought that the moon might be looking in and wondering how long I meant to stay on，in a place from which everything else had gone．“Oh no，”said the moon，“time means very little to me．”

I would have liked to have stayed on until I could have seen the squatters installed in their new place．But the surveying of the land took time，and it was uncertain when they would be able to move on to it．





Farewell


At that time，it came to pass that the old men of the neighbourhood resolved to hold a Ngoma for me．

These Ngomas of the Ancients had been great functions in the past，but now they were rarely danced，and during all my time in Africa I have never seen one of them．I should have liked to have done so，for the Kikuyu themselves thought highly of them．It was considered an honour to the farm that the old men's dance was to be performed there，my people talked of it a long time before it was to take place．

Even Farah，who generally looked down on the Native Ngomas，was this time impressed by the resolution of the old men．“These people are very old，Memsahib，”he said，“very very old．”

It was curious to hear the young Kikuyu lions speak with reverence and awe of the coming performance of the old dancers．

There was one thing about these Ngomas of which I did not know—namely that they had been prohibited by the government．The reason for the prohibition I do not know．The Kikuyu must have been aware of the interdiction，but they chose to overlook it；either they reasoned that in these great troubled times，things might be done that in ordinary times could not be done，or else they really forgot about it in the midst of the strong emotions set going by the dance．They did not even have it in them to keep silent about the Ngoma．

The old dancers when they arrived were a rare，sublime sight．There were about a hundred of them，and they all arrived at the same time，and must have collected somewhere at a distance from the house．The old Native men are chilly people，and generally wrap and muffle themselves up well in furs and blankets，but here they were naked，as if solemnly stating the formidable truth．Their finery and war-paint were discreetly put on，but a few of them wore，on their old bald skulls，the big head-dresses of black eagle's feathers that you see on the heads of the young dancers．They did not need any ornaments either，they were impressive in themselves．They did not，like the old beauties of the European ballroom，strive to obtain a youthful appearance，the whole point and weight of the dance，to them themselves，and to the onlookers，lay in the old age of the performers．They had a queer sort of markings on them，the like of which I had never seen，chalked stripes running along their crooked limbs as if they were，in their stark truthfulness，emphasizing the stiff and brittle bones underneath the skin．Their movements，as they advanced in a slow prelusive march，were so strange that I wondered what sort of dance I was now to be shown．

As I stood and looked at them a fancy came back to me that had taken hold of me before：It was not I who was going away，I did not have it in my power to leave Africa，but it was the country that was slowly and gravely withdrawing from me，like the sea in ebb-tide．The procession that was passing here—it was in reality my strong pulpy young dancers of yesterday and the day before yesterday，who were withering before my eyes，who were passing away for ever．They were going in their own style，gently，in a dance，the people were with me，and I with the people，well content．

The old men did not speak，not even to one another，they were saving their strength for the coming efforts．

Just as the dancers had ranged themselves for the dance，an Askari from Nairobi arrived at the house with a letter for me，that the Ngoma must not take place．

I did not understand it，for it was to me a quite unlooked-for thing，and I had to read the paper through twice or three times．The Askari who had brought it was himself so impressed with the importance of the show he had upset，that he did not open his mouth to the old people or to my houseboys，nor strut or swagger in the usual manner of Askaris，who are pleased to show off their plenitude of power to other Natives．

During all my life in Africa I have not lived through another moment of such bitterness．I had not before known my heart to heave up in such a storm against the things happening to me．It did not even occur to me to speak；the nothingness of speech by now was manifest to me．

The old Kikuyu themselves stood like a herd of old sheep，all their eyes under the wrinkled lids fixed upon my face．They could not，in a second，give up the thing on which their hearts had been set，some of them made little convulsive movements with their legs；they had come to dance and dance they must．In the end I told them that our Ngoma was off．

The piece of news，I knew，would in their minds take on a different aspect，but what I could not tell．Perhaps they realized at once how completely the Ngoma was off，for the reason that there was no longer anybody to dance to，since I no longer existed．Perhaps they thought that it had，in reality，already been held，a matchless Ngoma，of such force that it made naught of everything else，and that，when it was over，everything was over．

A small Native dog on the lawn profited by the stillness to yap out loudly，and the echo ran through my mind：

…the little dogs and all，

Tray，Blanch，and Sweetheart，see，they bark at me．



Kamante，who had been put in charge of the tobacco that was to have been dealt out to the Ancients after the dance，in his habitual silent resourcefulness here thought the moment convenient for bringing it，and stepped forward with a big calabash filled with snuff．Farah waved him back，but Kamante was a Kikuyu，in understanding with the old dancers，and he had his way．The snuff was a reality．We now distributed it amongst the old men．After a little while they all walked away．




The people of the farm who grieved most at my departure were I think the old women．The old Kikuyu women have had a hard life，and have themselves become flint-hard under it，like old mules which will bite you if they can come to it．They were more difficult for any disease to kill off than their men，as I learned in my practice as a doctor，and they were wilder than the men，and，even more thoroughly than they，devoid of the faculty of admiration．They had borne a number of children and had seen many of them die；they were afraid of nothing．They carried loads of firewood—with a rein round their foreheads to steady them—of three hundred pounds，tottering below them，but unsubdued；they worked in the hard ground of their shambas，standing on their heads from the early morning till late in the evening．“From thence she seeketh the prey，and her eyes behold afar off．Her heart is as firm as a stone，yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstone．She mocketh at fear．What time she lifteth up herself on high，she scorneth the horse and his rider．Will she make many supplications unto thee？Will she speak soft words unto thee？”And they had a stock of energy in them still；they radiated vitality．The old women took a keen interest in everything that was going on on the farm，and would walk ten miles to look at an Ngoma of the young people；a joke，or a cup of tembu，would make their wrinkled toothless faces dissolve in laughter．This strength，and love of life in them，to me seemed not only highly respectable，but glorious and bewitching．

The old women of the farm and I had always been friends．They were the people who called me Jerie，the men and the children—except the very young—never used the name for me．Jerie is a Kikuyu female name，but it has some special quality—whenever a girl is born to a Kikuyu family a long time after her brothers and sisters，she is named Jerie，and I suppose that the name has a note of affection in it．

Now the old women were sorry that I was leaving them．From this last time，I keep the picture of a Kikuyu woman，nameless to me，for I did not know her well；she belonged，I think，to Kathegu's village，and was the wife or widow of one of his many sons．She came towards me on a path on the plain，carrying on her back a load of the long thin poles which the Kikuyu use for constructing the roofs of their huts—with them this is women's work．These poles may be fifteen feet long；when the women carry them they tie them together at the ends，and the tall conical burdens give to the people underneath them，as you see them travelling over the land，the silhouette of a prehistoric animal，or a giraffe．The sticks which this woman was carrying were all black and charred，sooted by the smoke of the hut during many years；that meant that she had been pulling down her house and was trailing her building materials，such as they were，to new grounds．When we met she stood dead still，barring the path to me，staring at me in the exact manner of a giraffe in a herd，that you will meet on the open plain，and which lives and feels and thinks in a manner unknowable to us．After a moment she broke out weeping，tears streaming over her face，like a cow that makes water on the plain before you．Not a word did she or I myself speak，and，after a few minutes，she ceded the way to me，and we parted，and walked on in opposite directions．I thought that after all she had some materials with which to begin her new house，and I imagined how she would set to work，and tie her sticks together，and make herself a roof．

The little herdboys on the farm，who had never in their lives known of a time when I had not been living in the house，on the other hand had a great deal of excitement and tension of suspense out of the idea that I was going away．It may have been to them difficult，and daring，to imagine the world without me in it，as if providence had been known to be abdicating．They rose to the surface of the long grass when I was passing and cried out to me：“When are you going away，Msabu？Msabu，in how many days are you going away？”




When in the end，the day came on which I was going away，I learned the strange learning that things can happen which we ourselves cannot possibly imagine，either beforehand，or at the time when they are taking place，or afterwards when we look back on them．Circumstances can have a motive force by which they bring about events without aid of human imagination or apprehension．On such occasions you yourself keep in touch with what is going on by attentively following it from moment to moment，like a blind person who is being led，and who places one foot in front of the other cautiously but unwittingly．Things are happening to you，and you feel them happening，but except for this one fact，you have no connection with them，and no key to the cause or meaning of them．The performing wild animals in a circus go through their programme，I believe，in that same way．Those who have been through such events can，in a way，say that they have been through death—a passage outside the range of imagination，but within the range of experience．

Gustav Mohr came out in his car in the early morning to go in to the railway station with me．It was a cool morning with but little colour in the air or the landscape．He himself looked pale，and blinked，and I remembered what an old Norwegian captain of a whaler down in Durban had explained to me，that the Norwegians are undismayed in any storm，but their nervous system cannot stand a calm．We had tea together on the millstone table，as we had had many times before．Here，to the west，the hills before us，with a little floating grey mist in the creeks，lived gravely through another moment of their many thousand years．I was very cold as if I had been up there．

My houseboys were still in the empty house，but they had，so to say，already moved their existence to other quarters，their families and their belongings had been sent off．Farah's women，and Saufe，had gone to the Somali village of Nairobi in a lorry the day before．Farah himself was going with me as far as Mombasa，and so was Juma's young son Tumbo，because he wanted to do so more than anything else in the world，and where，as parting gift，he had been given the choice between a cow and the journey to Mombasa，he had chosen the journey．

I said good-bye to each of my houseboys，and，as I went out，they，who had been carefully instructed to close the doors，left the door wide open behind me．This was a typical Native gesture，as if they meant that I was to come back again，or else they did so to emphasize that there was now nothing more to close the doors of the house on，and they might as well be open to all the winds．Farah was driving me，slowly，at the pace of a riding-camel I suppose，round by the drive and out of sight of the house．

As we came to the pond，I asked Mohr if we would not have time to stop for a moment，and we got out，and smoked a cigarette by the bank．We saw some fish in the water，which were now to be caught and eaten by people who had not known old Knudsen，and were not aware of the importance of the fish themselves．Here Sirunga，my squatter Kaninu's small grandson，who was an epileptic，appeared to say a last good-bye to me，for he had been round by the house to do so，incessantly，for the last days．When we got into the cars again and went off，he started to run after the cars as fast as he could，as if whirled on in the dust by the wind，for he was so small—like the final little spark from my fire．He ran all the way to where the farm-road joined the highroad，and I was afraid that he might come with us on to the highroad as well；it would have been then as if now all the farm were scattered and blown about in husks．But he stopped up at the corner；after all he did still belong to the farm．He stood there and stared after us，as long as I could see the turning of the farm-road．

On the way in to Nairobi，we saw a number of grasshoppers in the grass and on the road itself．A few whirred into the car，it looked as if they were coming back upon the country once more．

Many of my friends had come down to the station to see me off．Hugh Martin was there，heavy and nonchalant，and as he came and said goodbye to me，I saw my Doctor Pangloss of the farm as a very lonely figure，a heroic figure，who had bought his loneliness with everything he had，and somehow an African symbol．We took a friendly leave：we had had much fun together，and many wise talks．Lord Delamere was a little older，a little whiter，and with his hair cut shorter than when I had had tea with him in the Masai Reserve，when I came down there with my ox-transport，at the beginning of the war，but as exceedingly and concernedly courteous and polite now as then．Most of the Somalis of Nairobi were on the platform．The old cattle-trader Abdallah came up and gave me a silver ring with a turquoise in it，to bring me luck．Bilea，Denys's servant gravely asked me to give his respects to his master's brother in England，in whose house he had stayed in the old days．The Somali women，Farah told me on the way down in the train，had been at the station in rickshas，but when they had seen so many Somali men collected there，they had lost heart and had just driven back．

Gustav Mohr and I shook hands when I was already in the train．Now that the train was going to move，was already moving，he had got back his balance of mind．He wished so strongly to impart courage to me that he blushed deeply；his face was flaming and his light eyes shining at me．




At the Samburu station on the line，I got out of the train while the engine was taking in water，and walked with Farah on the platform．

From there，to the south-west，I saw the Ngong Hills．The noble wave of the mountain rose above the surrounding flat land，all air-blue．But it was so far away that the four peaks looked trifling，hardly distinguishable，and different from the way they looked from the farm．The outline of the mountain was slowly smoothed and levelled out by the hand of distance．
