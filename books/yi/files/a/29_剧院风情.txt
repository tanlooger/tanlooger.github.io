序言


给一本你很久之前写的书作序并不是一件很难的事情，因为匆匆流逝的这些年已经让你成为一个不同的人，你可以用全新的视角来审视这部作品。你看到书的缺点，然后为了读者的欢娱，你回想起了自己性格里的缺陷，按你的性格这种回想可能会让你可以忍受或者让你气馁，而你的这些性格缺陷就是你的书的缺点产生的原因；或者你会带着因距离而产生的对过去的满足感回顾你写书时的那些情况；你可以美好地描绘一番你的阁楼，或者稍稍得意地细细回想你面对忽视时的坚定沉着。但当你为了引诱读者去购买一本不再新颖的书而开始为你两三年前写的小说作序，这并非易事，因为你发现已经在这本书中详尽讲述了这一话题，且完成后就抛之脑后了。正如没有什么比已经燃尽的爱更加死气沉沉，对作者来说，没什么话题比那些他已经畅所欲言的话题更加无趣。当然你可以跟你的评论家们争吵，但这几乎没有什么意义；某某评论家对他前年阅读的小说的看法只能对一个太脆弱受不起如今这个乱作一团的世界的考验的作家有意义；评论家早已忘记了这书和他写的评论，而大多数读者亦不再对这些评论费心劳神了。

在我最初成为一名职业作家的时候，我习惯将报纸上的评论贴在剪贴簿上，觉得将来有一天再读到时会很有趣，而且我会细心地在每篇评论上端标上日期和刊发它的报纸的名称。但是，随着时间的推移，这些笨重的剪贴簿变得越来越难以处理，而且由于某些原因，我很少会长时间地居住在同一个地方，于是最终我觉得有必要让清洁工来处理掉它们。自那以后，时光荏苒，我就满足于只读有关我的短评而不收藏它们，且心态平和，既不会为那些不赞同的评论感到过分苦恼，也不会为那些称赞之词感到扬扬自得，然后将它们通通扔进我的废纸筐里。我印象里，总的来说，大家对《剧院风情》的评价相当好。然而，有些评论家抱怨我的女主人公朱莉娅·兰伯特不具有崇高的道德品质、伟大的智慧和高尚的灵魂，并推断出她只不过是一位不知名的三流女演员。据我所知，很多知名的女演员都有同样的观点。事实上，有一位上了年纪的女演员对我的评论非常尖刻，她在我还是个孩子的时候就非常有名，现在也依旧因她经常说的那些让人讨厌但逗人笑的话而被很多中年观众念念不忘，这些话通常以伤害与她合作的演员为代价；但我认为她的尖酸刻薄是源于她的误解。我在小说中很努力去明确地展现这一点：不论我的女主人公有任何其他缺陷，但她并不是一个势利眼。这一点自然也妨碍了这位老演员对于我的朱莉娅是位好演员的认可。我们都倾向于认为别人不会拥有我们的美德，除非他们拥有我们的恶习。

伟大是罕见的。在过去五十年，我见过很多女演员成名。我见过很多有天赋的人，很多在自己的领域胜过常人的人，很多拥有魅力、美貌和知识的人，但我想不到第二位我能毫不犹豫地用伟大来描述的女演员。她就是埃莉诺拉·杜丝(1)。或许西登斯夫人(2)也可称为伟大；或许雷切尔也可以；我不知道。我从未见过全盛时期的萨拉·伯恩哈特(3)，那些围绕着她的荣誉，有关她的夸张传说，让我很难清醒地评价她。她时常举止文雅，有时又会像任何演员女王那样咆哮。在她的全盛时期，她可能曾经是伟大的，而我只在她身上看到了伟大的附属物，那皇冠，那权杖，还有那貂皮斗篷——只见中国皇帝的新衣，未见中国的皇帝。除了我提到的那个例外，我只见过在某些角色上表现优秀的女演员，有时让人觉得非常优秀。依我看来，人在这件事情上的看法很大程度上依赖于他受到多少舞台魅力的影响。剧院给很多人带来的兴奋刺激是历久弥新的。对他们来说，那是一个充满神秘和欢乐的世界；剧院让他们进入想象的王国，增加他们生活里的乐趣，剧院所带来的假象为他们单调平凡的日常生活增添浪漫的金色光芒。当他们看着这位有名的女演员，她的美貌因化妆更加突出，她的重要性被聚光灯凸显，她说着似乎都是从她脑子里出来的优美句子，经历着不同寻常的事情并且承受着深刻的感情，他们觉得演员活得更充实；当他们力图描述那些技艺精湛的演员所带给他们的激动之情时，很自然地，他们会稍稍有些夸张。同样自然地，他们会忽略那使他们兴高采烈的表演至少有一部分功劳属于服装师、布景师、电工还有剧作家。

即使在我年轻时，我也没有迷恋舞台；这是由于我天生个性多疑，还是由于我脑子里充满的各种奇思妙想满足了我那浪漫的诉求，我不确定；而自从我的作品开始被搬上舞台后，我甚至连那点曾经对舞台抱有的幻想都失去了。当我发现为了让动作自然流畅需要付出多少努力，当我意识到让观众热泪盈眶的完美语调并非源于女演员的情感而是作者的体验，简而言之，当我明白一部戏剧呈现给观众前所经历的过程有多么复杂后，我发现无法用大众那样的敬畏、景仰之情来看待那些演员，甚至是那些最杰出的演员。另一方面，我看到他们身上有大众并不相信他们能拥有的那些品质。例如，我发现他们几乎无一例外地勤奋、勇敢、有耐心且一丝不苟。虽然完成一天的工作后疲惫不堪，我看到他们会心甘情愿地再排演一遍某个有难度的场景，而这个场景他们当天已经排演了六次；我看到他们虽然病到几乎无法起身，但仍旧进行演出，不愿让大众失望；我发现他们虽然爱摆架子，但当面对如何最好地表演戏剧、表现自己时，他们变得非常通情达理。在他们著名的“脾气”之后，而这所谓的“脾气”是自私和神经过敏的结合，在错误的印象下被或多或少地、有意识地强调是一种艺术感性的证明，他们身上还经常展现超出大众想象的精明、务实。我从未见过不爱炫耀的孩子，而在每个演员身上都保留了一些孩子气；他的许多最让人着迷的天赋也都源于此。他比常人更爱出风头，除了我们中的个别情况，这种癖好在常人身上很普遍，且如果他不具备，那他不应该去做一名演员；用幽默的态度而非鄙夷的态度去看待这种特别的性格特点才更明智。如果必须对长期和舞台接触的过程中形成的对演员的印象说几句的话，我会说他们的美德比他们伪装的更可靠，而他们的缺点是他们从事的这个冒险而严苛的职业的附带品。

从我创作第一部剧到最后一部剧中间隔了三十年，这期间，我和许多卓越的女演员有密切接触。朱莉娅·兰伯特并非她们之中哪一个人的形象。我收集了大家的品质特点，试图创造一个生动的人物形象。由于我并不为我所熟悉的杰出女演员的魅力所动，因此我敢说，我对我想象的人物形象的描述克制而冷静。可能正是这一点让那些无法将女演员和聚光灯分开的读者感到不安，让那些深深着迷于聚光灯以至于真的以为除此以外自己无其他内涵的女演员恼怒。他们并没有发挥自己的实际能力。艺术家的品质取决于人的品质，除了他的特殊天赋，如果他没有高尚的道德情操，也不可能在艺术上有超常的表现；然而，我不否定，这种高尚会以一种让人惊讶而不可思议的形式展现。我认为朱莉娅·兰伯特是真实的。我希望读者能注意到虽然她的仰慕者认为她是伟大的，虽然她贪婪地接受这些奉承，但我个人并没有宣称她异常成功、天赋异禀、认真而勤勉。我想补充说明我对她万分喜爱；我并没有为她的淘气感到震惊，也没有为她的荒谬而感到愤慨；不论她做什么，我都只能宠溺地看待她。

在我写完这篇序之前，我必须要告诉读者，在这本我邀请他细细品读的作品里我犯了两个错误。尽管小说家试图将每个细节都描写准确，但有时他也会犯错，而且不乏有人已经准备好为他指出错误。曾经在我的一部小说中我偶然提到了一片名为曼利的沙滩，这是游泳季节最受悉尼人喜欢的度假胜地，很不幸，我将它拼写为曼雷(4)。这个多余的“e”带给我来自新南威尔士州上百封充满愤怒和嘲笑的信件。你可能会认为，这很可能是印刷带来的小错误，虽然确实是由于我自己的不小心造成的，这是我对英联邦的故意侮辱。事实上，有位女士告诉我，这又一次显示了英国人对英国殖民地人民的无知的傲慢，如果下一次大英帝国卷入一场大陆战争，比起赶快去营救，澳大利亚的年轻人更喜欢静静待在家中，这得由像我这样的人负责。她用一个修辞学的句子结束了自己的信函。她问我，如果一个澳大利亚小说家在写英国的时候将伯恩茅斯多写了个“e”，英国人会怎么想？我的第一反应就是回答我认为英国人压根不会理会，即使它是错的，而事实上多个“e”才是正确的拼法，但我觉得我最好还是默默忍受这位女士的指责。在这本书中我犯了两个错误；我让我的女主人公承认她演不好比阿特丽斯(5)是因为她念不好无韵诗，并且当她谈到拉辛的《费德尔》时我让她抱怨该剧的女主人公直到第三幕才出现。我并没有验证这些事实，而是相信了我的记忆，我的记忆欺骗了我。比阿特丽斯几乎没有说诗句；她所有重要的戏都是以散文形式进行的；如果朱莉娅没有演好这个角色，那也并不是由于她所给出的原因。费德尔在第一幕第三场就出场了。我不明白为什么只有两个人向我指出这些不可辩解的错误；我喜欢认为大部分读者都在称赞我，认为这些错误并非源于我的疏忽，而是出于我的敏锐，且认为通过让朱莉娅用这种随意的语气说话，使得我对她个性的描述增添了一抹色彩。但我可能在过度自夸，很可能读者对随着这些人物出现的著名戏剧的记忆跟我一样模糊，跟我知道得差不多而已。

第一章


门打开了，迈克尔·格斯林抬起头来。朱莉娅走了进来。

“嘿！我不会耽搁太久的。我正在签署一些信件。”

“不着急。我就是来看看给丹诺伦特一家送了什么位置的票。那个年轻人在这里做什么？”

出于一位老到的女演员用动作配合自己对白的本能，她将梳得整齐的头一偏，示意她刚刚经过的屋子。

“他就是那个会计，从劳伦斯—汉弗雷会计师事务所来的。他来这儿三天了。”

“他看起来很年轻。”

“他是一个见习会计师。他看起来很懂行。但他对我们一直以来的记账系统感到惊奇。他跟我说，他从来没有想到一个剧院能经营得如此有条理。他说伦敦城里有些公司的记账方式能让人愁到头发都白了。”

看着丈夫帅气的脸上流露出扬扬自得的神情，朱莉娅笑了。

“他是个会说话的年轻人。”

“他今天就结束工作了。我想我们可以让他同我们一起回去，请他吃个简单的午餐。他很绅士。”

“那就足以邀请他吃午餐了吗？”

迈克尔没有注意到她语气里那一丝嘲讽的意味。

“如果你不愿意的话，我就不问他了。我只是觉得这会令他欣喜万分。他极其崇拜你。这回的戏他都已经看过三遍了。他做梦都想被人介绍和你认识。”

迈克尔按了一个按钮，不一会儿，他的秘书进来了。

“给你这些信，玛格丽。我今天下午有什么安排？”

朱莉娅心不在焉地听着玛格丽口中的预约时间表，漫不经心地看着四周，虽然她对这房间非常熟悉。这是一间与一流剧场的经理非常相配的房间。房间的墙壁由优秀的房屋设计师镶了护墙板（按成本价），墙上挂着佐芬尼和德维尔德的版画，内容是一些舞台场景。扶手椅宽大又舒适。迈克尔坐在一把雕刻繁复的齐彭代尔椅里，虽然是一件复制品，但由一家有名的公司制作。他的齐彭代尔桌的爪球腿大而结实，坚固无比。桌子上摆着一个结实的银色相框，里面是她自己的照片，旁边对称的是他们的儿子罗杰的照片。在这中间有一个华丽的银色墨水台，那是某次迈克尔生日时她送给他的礼物，后面摆放的是一个红色摩洛哥风格的架子，镀了大量的金，架子上放着他的私人信纸，供他想亲笔写信的时候用。信纸上印着西登斯剧场的地址，信封印着他的饰章，一个野猪头，以及下面这句话：犯我者必受惩罚(1)。一束黄色郁金香插在银色碗里——那是他连续三次赢得戏剧高尔夫巡回赛后获得的——显示出玛格丽的小心呵护。朱莉娅看了她一眼。尽管她剪短的头发漂白过，口红又涂得过于厚重，却有一副被认为是完美秘书应该有的中性外表。她跟随迈克尔已经五年了。这么久的时间里，她对迈克尔从里到外肯定相当了解。朱莉娅在想她是否会蠢到爱上迈克尔。

迈克尔突然从他坐的椅子上站了起来。

“好了，亲爱的，我们现在可以走了。”

玛格丽递给迈克尔他的黑色卷边软呢帽，并为朱莉娅和迈克尔打开房门，让他们先出去。当他们走进办公室时，朱莉娅注意过的那个年轻人转身站了起来。

“我想把你介绍给兰伯特小姐。”迈克尔说道。接着，他显示出一副大使向他觐见的宫廷君主介绍随员的气派，说道：“这就是那位非常优秀的绅士，多亏了他，我们乱作一团的账目终于有了些头绪。”

年轻人脸变得通红。他僵硬地笑着回应朱莉娅温暖、现成的微笑，她友善地握了一下他的手，发现他的掌心已都是汗水。他这副困窘的样子令人同情。那是当人们见到萨拉·西登斯时才会有的感受。她想起，当迈克尔提议请这男孩吃顿午餐的时候她对迈克尔有点刻薄。她直视着他的双眼。她自己的眼睛很大，深棕色，炯炯有神。做出这副神情对她来说一点都不费劲，做出稍稍觉得有趣、友好亲切的表情就好像挥去在她身边飞来飞去的苍蝇一样已是她的本能。

“我在想，我们是否能邀请您来我家，和我们一同吃顿便餐。午饭后迈克尔会开车送您回来。”

年轻人再次脸红，他的喉结在他细细的脖子里滚动。

“您对我太好了。”他焦虑地看了一眼他的衣服，“我浑身脏透了。”

“我们到家后您可以梳洗整理一下。”

汽车在剧院后门等待着他们，这是一辆黑色镀铬的长款车，车座由银色皮革包着，车门上不起眼地印着迈克尔的饰章。朱莉娅坐了进去。

“过来跟我一起坐。迈克尔要开车。”

他们住在史坦霍普广场，当他们到达后，朱莉娅让管家带着年轻人去盥洗的地方。她上楼回到会客室。当迈克尔过来找她的时候，朱莉娅正在描唇。

“我已经告诉他，让他一准备好就上楼来。”

“顺便问一句，他叫什么名字？”

“我不知道。”

“亲爱的，我们必须得知道他的名字。我会让他在我们的本子上题词。”

“可恶，他还没重要到那个地步。”迈克尔通常只会请非常重要的有名望的人在本子上题词，“我们再也不会见到他了。”

就在这时，年轻人出现了。在汽车里，朱莉娅努力让他放松下来，但他依旧非常腼腆。鸡尾酒已经备好，迈克尔为大家斟好酒。朱莉娅抽出一根香烟，年轻人划了根火柴为她点着火，但他手抖得非常厉害，以至于朱莉娅认为他根本无法将火凑上她的香烟，所以她握着他的手点着了烟。

“可怜的年轻人，”她心里想，“我想这可能是他人生中最辉煌的时刻。当他将这一经历告诉他的朋友时，他肯定会特别开心。我估计他会成为办公室里那个遭人嫉妒诅咒的小英雄。”

朱莉娅同自己说话和同别人说话的样子非常不同：当她跟自己说话时，她的语言生动有趣。她将第一口烟吸入肺叶，兴致不错。当你仔细想想，能同她共进午餐，并聊上四十五分钟，真是件美事，说不定还能让一个人在他狭小的圈子里变得十分重要。

年轻人强迫自己说了句话。

“这屋子太壮观了！”

朱莉娅给了他一个短暂、开心的微笑，她精致的眉毛稍稍向上一挑，这表情他一定非常熟悉，常常在朱莉娅表演的时候看到。

“我很开心你喜欢它。”她的声音低沉甚至有点沙哑。你或许真的会认为他的评论让她如释重负，“在我们家里，我们都认为迈克尔的品位非常高。”

迈克尔满意地瞥了一眼屋子。

“我有不少经验。我总是为我们的戏剧设计布景。当然，有人会为我做这些粗活，但想法都是我的。”

他们两年前搬进了这屋子，迈克尔和朱莉娅心知肚明，当他们外出巡演的时候，他们把这屋子交给了一个收费昂贵的设计师，并且这设计师许诺，在他们巡演回来的时候，把屋子完全装修好，而且只收取成本费用，以此来换取他们承诺给他的那些剧院里的活儿。但没有必要把这些冗杂的细节告诉一个他们连名字都不知道的年轻人。这房子装修品位极佳，既古典，又不失现代感，迈克尔说一眼就能看出这是一座绅士居住的房子，一点都没错。然而，朱莉娅坚持自己的卧室要按照自己喜欢的样子来，在他们摄政公园的老房子里她有一间喜欢的卧室，战争结束后他们就住在那里，她把那间卧室照搬了过来。床和梳妆台用粉色丝绸包了起来，躺椅和扶手椅是淡青色；床的上方是几个镀金的胖天使，一起悬吊着一盏淡粉色灯罩的灯，在梳妆台的镜子周围也簇拥着镀金的小胖天使。在椴木桌上摆着的是男演员们、女演员们以及皇室成员的签名照，相框华丽繁复。设计师对这屋子挑起了眉毛，不屑一顾，但只有在这间屋子里，朱莉娅才觉得完全放松。她坐在一个镀金的哈姆雷特风格的凳子上，俯在一张椴木桌子上写信。

午饭准备好了，他们走下楼。

“我希望你能吃得饱，”朱莉娅说，“迈克尔和我的胃口都非常小。”

事实上，午饭有烤鳎目鱼、烤牛排、菠菜和炖水果。这是一顿为了满足饥肠辘辘的人而不会产生脂肪设计的饭菜。厨子在玛格丽跟他说了中午会有客人来吃午餐后，匆匆煎了些土豆。土豆看起来清脆可口，闻着很有食欲。只有这个年轻人碰了它们。朱莉娅留恋地看了一眼土豆，然后摇了摇头以示拒绝。迈克尔神情严肃地盯着它们看了一会儿，就好像不认识这道菜似的，然后慢慢地，打破了沉思，说了声“谢谢，不需要了”。他们坐在一张长长的餐桌旁，朱莉娅和迈克尔分别坐在桌子两端硕大的意大利椅子里，年轻人坐在桌子的中间，他的椅子可没有那么舒服，但非常有形。朱莉娅注意到他似乎在看餐柜，她带着迷人的微笑，向前倾了倾身子。

“怎么了？”

年轻人脸变得通红。

“我在想，我能不能吃片面包？”

“当然！”

她意味深长地看了管家一眼；此刻，管家正在为迈克尔倒一杯干白葡萄酒，然后他离开了房间。

“迈克尔和我从来不吃面包。杰文斯犯傻，没有意识到你可能会想吃一些。”

“当然，面包只是一种习惯，”迈克尔说道，“如果你决计不吃它，不久你就会发现你不需要它了。”

“这可怜的小伙瘦得像杆一样，迈克尔。”

“我不吃面包，因为我怕变胖。我不吃它还因为我觉得没意义。毕竟，就我的运动强度而言，我可以吃任何我想吃的东西。”

迈克尔五十二岁了，身材仍然很棒。他年轻的时候，有一头栗色的鬈发，他皮肤白皙，蓝眼睛大而深邃，鼻梁笔直，再加上那对小小的耳朵，他曾是英国舞台上最好看的男演员。唯一美中不足的地方就是他的嘴唇有点单薄。迈克尔只有六英尺高，举止勇猛。正是他那显而易见的美貌让他走向了舞台而不是像他父亲那样成为军人。现在，他那栗色的头发都已灰白，而且剪得很短；他的脸变得松弛，还有不少皱纹；脸蛋也不再像桃花般娇嫩，肤色变得潮红。但以他那美丽的眼睛和尚好的身材来讲，他仍旧是个美男子。自从他在军队里待了五年之后，他便有了军人风度，以至于如果你不知道他是谁（虽然这极其不可能，因为他的照片总是以各种形式出现在画报上），你可能会认为他是一个高级军官。他吹嘘自二十岁起他的体重就再没变过，并且这么多年来，不论刮风下雨，他每天早晨都会在八点的时候换上短裤和运动上衣，绕着摄政公园跑一圈。

“那个秘书告诉我，今早您在排练，兰伯特小姐，”年轻人说道，“是说您要有新剧上演了吗？”

“并不是，”迈克尔回答道，“我们的剧目已经太多了。”

“迈克尔觉得我们演得有点粗糙，所以他安排了一场排练。”

“我非常高兴我安排了这场排练。我发现他们有一些我没有授意的表演小细节悄悄地混了进来，并且台词也被随意修改。我坚持剧作家的原话应该一字不动地被照念，虽然，上帝知道，如今的剧作家写不了多少话。”

“如果你想来看我们的剧，”朱莉娅优雅地说道，“我肯定迈克尔会很乐意给你几张票。”

“我很想再去观看，”年轻人急忙回答，“我已经看过三遍了。”

“都三遍了？”朱莉娅满是惊讶地叫道，尽管她清楚地记得迈克尔已经将此事告诉她了，“当然，这剧还不算差，还算令人满意，但我无法想象有谁会看三遍。”

“我去看并不是为了那剧本身，而是去看您的表演。”

“我总算逼你说出这句话了。”朱莉娅想着，然后她大声说道：“当我们读到剧本的时候，迈克尔对这出剧表示很怀疑。他觉得我的角色不够好。你知道，并不是什么明星角色。但我觉得我能把这角色演出点什么来。当然，我们不得不在彩排的时候砍掉很多另外一个女人的戏。”

“我并不是说我们重写了剧本，”迈克尔说道，“但我跟你讲，现在这出剧跟作者交给我们的有很大不同。”

“您在剧中简直太棒了。”年轻人说道。

（“他有某种魅力。”）“你喜欢我，这让我很开心。”她回答道。

“如果你这么仰慕朱莉娅，我敢说，你走的时候她会给你一张她的照片。”

“会吗？”

他的脸又红了，蓝色的眼睛闪闪发光。（“他真的很可爱。”）他算不上好看，但有一张真诚、坦率的脸，而且他的羞怯很迷人。他有一头淡棕色的鬈发，但被他用发油抹得平平的。朱莉娅想，如果他能利用自己的鬈发梳个漂亮的发型，而不是试图把波浪都弄直，他肯定会好看许多。他气色不错，皮肤也很好，长了一口精致的牙齿。她发现，他的衣服很合身，穿得很得体，这让她对他赞赏有加。他看上去干净漂亮。

“我估计你从未跟剧院内部打过交道吧？”朱莉娅说道。

“从来没有，因此我特别渴望拿到这份工作。您无法想象当我得知我可以来做这份工作的时候，我有多激动。”

迈克尔和朱莉娅朝着他亲切地微笑。他的仰慕让他们觉得自己高高在上，扬扬得意。

“我从来不允许外人来观看排练，但作为我们的会计，你也算得上剧院的人了，而且我不介意为你开此先例，如果你愿意来的话。”

“您对我真的太好了。我这辈子还从未见过一场排练。您会出演下一部戏吗？”

“哦，我想不会吧。我对表演不再那么热衷了。我发现几乎不可能找到一个适合我的角色。你看，在我这个年纪我无法出演年轻的恋人，而且剧作家也不再像我年轻那会儿那样描述这些角色了。就是法国人所谓的说教者。你知道我所指的那类人吧，公爵，或是内阁大臣，或是地位显赫的皇室顾问，他们说些聪明话，动动小手指就能让人围着他转。我不知道现在的剧作家都怎么了。他们似乎写不出好的台词。无米之炊，这就是我们演员如今所面临的困境。他们感激我吗？我是说那些剧作家。如果我告诉你他们中一些人竟然有胆量提出那样的条件，你一定会大吃一惊。”

“事实上，没有他们我们也不行，”朱莉娅笑道，“如果剧本不行，世界上没有什么表演能够拯救一出戏。”

“那是因为公众对剧院没什么真正的兴趣。在英国剧院的黄金年代，人们并不是去看戏剧，他们去看的是演员。他们不会管肯布尔(2)或者西登斯夫人演的是什么。大家都是奔着他们的人去的。即使到现在，虽然我不否认如果剧本不好那演员也就完蛋了，但我认为，如果剧本不错，人们是去看演员的，而不是戏剧本身。”

“我认为没人能否认这点。”朱莉娅说道。

“像朱莉娅这样的女演员所需要的就是一个媒介。把这媒介给她，剩下的她都会完成。”

朱莉娅给了年轻人一个愉悦的却有点不以为然的微笑。

“你千万不能太把我丈夫的话当真。恐怕我们必须承认在关系到我的事情上他无法做到公平公正。”

“除非这位年轻人是个大傻瓜，否则他一定也会觉得在表演方面你无所不能。”

“哦，那只是人们的错觉，因为我只会去做我自己能够胜任的事情。”

迈克尔当即看了看他的手表。

“年轻人，你喝完咖啡后，我们得出发了。”

这男孩大口咽下他杯子里剩余的咖啡，此刻朱莉娅从桌子旁站了起来。

“你不会忘记答应给我照片吧？”

“我想迈克尔的小房间里应该有一些。我们一起去挑一张。”

她带着他去了餐厅后面的一间很大的房间。虽然这应该是迈克尔的私人起居室——“每个男人都想要一间他能随心所欲、抽烟的房间”——它却主要被用作客人们的衣帽间。那里有一张高贵的红木桌子，上面摆着乔治五世和玛丽王后的签名照片。壁炉架上摆着一张老旧的由劳伦斯为饰演哈姆雷特的肯布尔画的肖像复制品。在一张小桌子上堆着一摞剧本打字稿。这房间四面都是书架，下面是橱柜，从其中一间里，朱莉娅拿出一摞她最新的照片，递了一张给年轻人。

“这张还不错。”

“很漂亮。”

“是吗？那我想可能不太像我。”

“但就是你。跟你一模一样。”

她向他展示了另外一种微笑，有点小淘气的样子；她垂下了眼睑，然后又抬了起来，带着她那种被人们形容为天鹅绒般的眼神，她用这种眼神温柔地盯着他看了一会儿。她这么做没有任何目的。如果不是条件反射，就是出于要讨好别人的本能。这男孩如此年轻，又如此腼腆，他看上去心地善良，但她再也不会见到他了。她希望他的那些钱花得很值；她希望他将这一刻作为人生的重要时刻来回忆。她又瞥了一眼照片。她希望自己就是照片里的样子。摄影师在她的帮助下让她摆出了最佳姿势，以展现她最美的那面。她的鼻子有点宽但摄影师通过灯光让它看上去小巧精致，平滑的皮肤上没有一丝皱纹，她漂亮的眼睛含情脉脉。

“好吧，你就拿这张吧。你知道我并不美丽，甚至算不上漂亮。科克兰(3)以前总是说我有魔鬼之美(4)。你懂法语的，对吧？”

“还能够理解这句。”

“我来给你签名。”

她坐在桌子旁，用她粗放流畅的字体写道：你真诚的朱莉娅·兰伯特。

第二章


等两个男人走后，她又翻阅了一遍这些照片，之后把它们放回原处。

“对于一个四十六岁的女人来说还不错，”她笑道，“我跟照片里一样，没必要否认。”她想在房间里找面镜子照照，但却没有。“可恶的设计师。可怜的迈克尔，难怪他从来不用这间屋子。当然，我始终拍不好照片。”

她有种想看一看她的旧照片的冲动。迈克尔是个整洁、有条理的人，她的照片都保存在一个大纸箱里，标注了日期，并按照时间顺序存放。他本人的照片在那个纸箱的其他盒子里。

“当有人愿意写我们的职业生涯的故事时，他会发现所有他需要的资料都已经准备好了。”迈克尔这样说道。

本着同样值得赞许的目的，他把有关他们俩的媒体报道全都剪下来，按照时间顺序，贴在了一本本簿子里。

那里有朱莉娅儿童时期的照片，少女时期的照片，她饰演第一个角色的照片，她初为人妻的照片，和迈克尔在一起，之后有了罗杰，她的儿子，那时他还是个婴儿。有一张他们一家三口的照片，迈克尔很男人，极其英俊，她自己温婉恬淡地低头看着罗杰，眼神中充满母爱，而罗杰是个一头鬈发的小男孩，这张照片拍得简直太成功了。所有画报都整版刊登了它，他们还曾在节目单中用过，后来缩印成明信片大小，在外省售卖了好多年。让人懊恼的是当罗杰去了伊顿公学后就拒绝跟她一起拍照了。他不想上报纸这件事还真让人觉得好笑。

“人们会以为你变丑了或是发生了其他的事情，”她告诉罗杰，“而且这并不是什么不好的事情。你应该去首演夜看一看，看那些社会人士是如何聚集在摄影师旁边的，内阁大臣，法官，所有人。他们可能假装不喜欢被拍照，但你看看当他们觉得摄影师盯上他们时摆出的姿势就知道了。”

但罗杰很固执。

朱莉娅看到一张她饰演比阿特丽斯的照片。这是她唯一扮演过的莎剧角色。她知道她穿那身戏服并不好看；她无法理解原因，因为没人能像她那样把现代服装穿得光彩照人。她的衣服，不论是舞台的还是私人的，都在巴黎定制，按裁缝的说法，没人比她的订单更多了。她身材姣好，这一点有口皆碑；作为一个女人来说她很高，双腿修长。可惜的是，她从未有机会扮演罗莎琳德(1)，她穿男孩的戏服应该会很好看，当然现在为时已晚，但或许没有冒险尝试也不错。虽然你可能认为，以她的聪明才智、淘气可爱，以及她的幽默感，她一定会呈现完美的表演。评论家从来没有真正喜欢过她演的比阿特丽斯。这都是那可恶的无韵诗搞的鬼。她的声音低沉浑厚，带着令人印象深刻的嘶哑，遇到倾诉情感的台词，会让你的心都揪起来；如果是搞笑的台词，则会添加不少幽默效果。但当她读比阿特丽斯的台词时，感觉完全不对。还有，关于她的吐字，她吐字非常清晰，即使不提高嗓门，也能让楼座最后一排的观众听得清清楚楚；人们说，这声音让诗歌听起来像散文。而在她看来，其实是因为她过于现代。

迈克尔是演莎剧出道的。那会儿她还不认识他。他在剑桥出演过罗密欧，当他离开剑桥在一所戏剧学院待了一年后，本森雇用了他。他在全国巡演，扮演了各种角色。但他认识到莎剧对他职业发展没什么帮助，如果想要成为一名主演他必须获得出演现代戏剧的经验。有个叫詹姆斯·兰顿的人在米德尔普尔经营一个轮演剧目剧团，吸引了不少人关注。迈克尔在本森那儿待了三年，当公司去米德尔普尔巡演的时候，他写信给兰顿，问能不能与他见一面。詹姆斯·兰顿，一个肥胖秃头、满脸红光的四十五岁男人，模样宛如鲁本斯画中殷实的市民，却对戏剧情有独钟。他是一个古怪、自大、活力四射、自负又迷人的家伙。他爱表演，但他的体形让他无法出演太多角色，但所幸他演得也不怎么样。他无法抑制他那炫耀的本性，虽然他出演每个角色都会仔细琢磨，百般研究，但他的表演最后总是怪诞可笑。他夸大每个动作，夸张每个声调。但当他指导他的演员班底进行排练时，又成了另外一副样子——他无法忍受任何浮于表面的表演。他的耳朵非常灵敏，虽然他自己无法说出正确的声调，但他绝不会放过别人声调里的一丝错误。

“不要真的自然，”他告诉他的团员，“舞台不是为了这种东西存在的。舞台是虚假的艺术。但看上去要自然。”

他为他的剧团紧张而努力地工作。团员们每天早晨从十点开始排练，直到下午两点他才会让他们解散，并敦促他们回家研习各自的角色，在晚上正式表演前稍事休息。他威吓他们，朝他们大喊大叫，嘲弄他们。他给他们微薄的工资。但如果他们演好了一出感人的戏，他会像孩子一样大哭；而如果他们按照他想要的样子说了一句有趣的台词，他会哈哈大笑。如果高兴了，他可以单腿在舞台上跳来跳去；如果生气了，他会把剧本扔在地上，踩上几脚，并让愤怒的眼泪在他的脸颊上流淌。整个剧团的员工都嘲笑他，冷落他，又都尽其所能地取悦他。他激起他们一种保护的本能，他们所有人都觉得不能让他失望。虽然他们说他像对待奴隶一样对待他们，他们从来没有自己的时间，连身体都无法忍受这样的工作强度，但顺从他那令人发指的要求带给他们一种变态的满足感。当他紧紧握着一个周薪七英镑的老团员的手说道：“我向上帝发誓，老家伙，你太棒了！”那老团员感觉自己好像是查尔斯·基恩(2)一般。

迈克尔按时赴约，而此刻吉米·兰顿正好需要一个年轻的主角。他已经猜到迈克尔想要见他的原因，因此前一天晚上去看了他出演的戏剧。迈克尔扮演的是茂丘西奥(3)，兰顿并不看好他的表演，但当迈克尔来到他的办公室时，他被迈克尔的美貌打动了。迈克尔穿着棕色外套和灰色法兰绒长裤，甚至没有化妆，他那帅气的外表能让人惊羡得无法呼吸。他举止文雅，说话如谦谦君子。当迈克尔说明他的来意，兰顿一丝不苟地观察着他。如果他会演戏的话，再加上这副外表，这个年轻人一定前程远大。

“我昨晚去看了你演的丘西奥，”他说道，“你自己是怎么看这角色的？”

“糟糕透了。”

“我也这么认为。你多大了？”

“二十五。”

“我估计肯定有人告诉过你，你长得很好看。”

“这是为什么我选择了舞台的原因。否则我会像我父亲那样去参军。”

“天啊！如果我要是有你的外表，我该会是个多么好的演员。”

这次会晤以迈克尔拿到一份合约结束。他在米德尔普尔待了两年。不久，他与剧团成员混熟。他幽默和善，尽力地帮助每一个人，不计麻烦。他的美貌在米德尔普尔引起了一阵轰动，女孩子常常在戏院门口等着见他。她们给他写情书，递鲜花。他将这一切视作观众对演员正常的敬慕，但绝不允许自己被冲昏头脑。他渴望上进，决计不让任何情感纠葛阻碍他职业的发展。最后，仍旧是他的美貌救了他，因为吉米·兰顿很快认识到，虽然他有坚持的毅力和成功的意愿，但他当演员永远不称职。他的声音有点单薄，慷慨激昂时，会更加尖细。这声音所展示的效果是歇斯底里而不是激情四射。但他作为年轻主演最致命的缺点是他无法表演求爱。在念普通的对话时，他还算轻松自如，能够表现出台词的意义，但要表达强烈感情时，似乎有什么东西抑制了他。他感到窘迫，手足无措。

“可恶，不要像抱着一袋土豆一样抱着那女孩。”吉米·兰顿冲他怒吼道，“你亲吻她时就好像你怕你们正站在风口处。你跟那女孩是相爱的。你必须自己感受到你跟她处于恋爱中。就好像你的骨头在你身体里要融化了，即使下一分钟地震将你吞噬，你也会不管不顾，让地震去见鬼。”

但这些都没用。除了他的美貌、他的优雅和他的随和，迈克尔依旧是一个冷漠的爱人。但这并不妨碍朱莉娅疯狂地爱上了他。他们就是在迈克尔加入兰顿的轮演剧目剧团时认识的。

朱莉娅的事业可谓顺风顺水。她出生在泽西岛，她父亲也在岛上出生，是一名兽医。她母亲的妹妹嫁给了一个法国煤炭商人，住在圣马洛(4)，朱莉娅被送到那里与姨妈一起生活，在当地中学读书。她的法语说得与法国女人一般无二。她是天生的演员，而且，自她能记事起，大家就认为她将来一定会登台演出。她的姨妈，法卢夫人，与一位老年女演员“有点关系”，这位女演员曾是法兰西喜剧院的一个成员，现在退休住在圣马洛，靠着她的一个情人在多年的忠诚同居之后与她分手时给她的微薄的赡养费活着。朱莉娅十二岁的时候，这名女演员已是一个性子泼辣、身材臃肿的六十多岁的老女人，但她活力依旧，热爱食物胜过世界上的一切。她笑声爽朗，像男人一样，说起话来声音低沉响亮。是她为朱莉娅上了表演的启蒙课。她把她在艺术学校所学的所有艺术知识都教授给了朱莉娅，她与她讲赖兴贝格到七十岁还在出演天真少女，讲萨拉·伯恩哈特和她的金嗓子，讲穆内·萨利(5)和他的威严，还有科克兰，他是这群演员中最出色的。她用在剧院学会的方法，把高乃依和拉辛慷慨激昂的长篇演说背诵给朱莉娅，并教她以同样的方式念出来。听到朱莉娅用孩子气的嗓音背诵《费德尔》里那些充满激情的演讲简直太有趣了，她会强调亚历山大诗体的节拍，满口的词被她念得装腔作势却又充满戏剧化。这个珍妮·塔特布一定是个做作的女演员，但她教会朱莉娅吐字清晰、如何走路以及如何控制自己，她告诉朱莉娅不要害怕自己的声音，强调时间感的重要性，这也是朱莉娅与生俱来的本能，在她后来的舞台生涯中成了她最厉害的天赋之一。

“不要停顿，除非你有特殊的理由，”她严肃地说道，握紧的拳头重重地砸在她前面的桌子上，“但当你停顿的时候，你就尽可能长时间地停顿。”

朱莉娅十六岁时去了坐落在高尔街上的皇家戏剧艺术学院，彼时她已经知道了那里能教给她的一切。她需要抛弃一些已经过时的技巧，采用更加谈话式的语调来演戏。她赢得了每一个她所能参与的奖项的评选，当她完成学业后，一口流利的法语立刻让她在伦敦获得了一个法国女仆的小角色。一时看来，似乎她的法语技能会让她专门出演那些需要外国口音的角色，在法国女仆这一角色后，她又扮演了一个奥地利服务员。大概在两年后吉米·兰顿发现了她。那时她正在全国巡演一出在伦敦受到好评的情景剧；在这个阴谋诡计最终败露的意大利女骗子的角色里，她正试图呈现一个四十岁女人的样子，有些力不从心。因为剧中的女主角是个金发白肤的成熟女人，却在扮演一个妙龄少女，表演缺乏真实。吉米那时正在休假，而他的度假方式是夜夜去戏院观戏，一个城市的剧院看完接着去下一个城市。在朱莉娅的戏结束后，吉米到后台去见她。以他在戏剧圈的知名度足以让朱莉娅感到受宠若惊，当他邀请她第二天中午共进午餐时，她答应了。

待他们一坐下来，吉米便直奔主题。

“我一宿没合眼，一直在想你。”他说道。

“这太突然了。您的提议是光明正大的还是无耻下流的？”

他并没有在意朱莉娅无礼的答复。

“我在这个圈子里混了二十五年了。我曾做过催场员、置景工、舞台监督、演员、宣传，该死，我甚至做过剧评人。我自从离开寄宿学校就住在剧院，如果还有我不知道的有关表演的事情，那就是不值得我知道。我觉得，你是个天才。”

“您过奖了。”

“别说话。让我来说。你样样具备：合适的身高，漂亮的外形，像天然橡胶一样的脸。”

“您在恭维我，是吧？”

“正是这样。这是一张女演员都想要的脸。一张能展现一切的脸，甚至是美丽，一张能展现任何脑袋中想法的脸。杜丝就有这样一张脸。昨晚尽管你并没有思考你正在做的事情，但你说的那些话时刻都写在你的脸上。”

“这是个糟糕的角色，让我实在无法专注。您听到我说的那些台词了吗？”

“是演员糟糕，并不是角色。你音色很棒，能够抓住观众的心，我不知道你演喜剧的功底，但我打算冒次险。”

“您说这个是什么意思？”

“你演戏的时机很对。这点是无法被指导的，你一定是天生就懂。这可比后天学来的不知好多少。现在让我们讲讲基本事实。我一直在四处打听你。你好像法语说得跟法国女人一样，所以他们总是给你糟糕的英语角色。出演这种角色你不会有前途，你知道的。”

“我只能拿到这种角色。”

“你自己满足于永远扮演这类角色吗？你会陷入这些角色里，大众也不会接受你演其他角色。你只能演次要角色。一周最多挣二十镑，而且你非凡的才华都浪费掉了。”

“我总是期盼有一天我能有机会出演一个正式的角色。”

“什么时候？你可能需要等待十年。你现在多大？”

“二十岁。”

“酬劳多少？”

“一周十五英镑。”

“撒谎。你一周拿十二英镑，而且你并不值这些。你还有很多东西要学习。你的动作太普通。你不知道，每一个手势动作都必须有意义。你不知道如何在你开始说话前让观众都看你。你妆化得太浓。以你这样的脸，妆越少越好。难道你不想成为一位明星吗？”

“谁不想呢？”

“来我这儿吧，我会把你塑造成英国最伟大的女演员。你学东西学得快吗？你这个年龄应该学得很快。”

“我觉得我可以在四十八小时内记住任何角色的台词。”

“你需要的是经验，以及我作为你的经纪人。来我这儿吧，我会让你一年出演二十个角色，易卜生、萧伯纳、巴克、苏徳曼、汉金、高尔斯华绥。你自带磁力，但你却不知道如何运用它。”他咯咯地笑了起来，“上帝，如果你知道这一点，那个老女人也不会让你出演现在的剧了。你得掐住观众的脖子，跟他们说，‘你们这些狗崽子，你们都给我注意了。’你必须镇住他们。如果你没有这点天赋，没人能帮得了你，但如果你有，你可以通过学习明白如何使用它。我告诉你，你有成为一名伟大女演员的一切素养。我这辈子还没有如此肯定过。”

“我知道我需要舞台经验。当然我得仔细考虑一下。我不介意去您那里待一个演出季。”

“见鬼去吧。你认为我能在一个演出季就把你塑造成一名伟大的女演员吗？你认为我会全力以赴就为了让你能在伦敦出演一些微不足道的小角色？你把我当成了什么傻瓜？我会跟你签三年的合同，给你一周八英镑的薪水，而你将像牛马一样地工作。”

“八英镑一周太可笑了。我无法接受。”

“你能。你现在就值这么多，你也就只能拿这么多。”

朱莉娅已经演了三年的戏，学到了不少东西。另外，珍妮·塔特布，一个非严格的道德家，还向她传授了许多其他有用的信息。

“您是不是觉得我会让您跟我睡觉？”

“天哪，你认为我有时间跟我剧团的成员睡觉？比起这个，我有更加重要的事情去做，我的小姐。而且，你会发现，在四个小时的排练和晚上的演出后，如果能将这些事情都能做到令我满意，再加上日常演出，你自己不会有太多时间，或者还有跟别人做爱的精力。当你回到床上，你只会想睡觉。”

但是，关于这一点，吉米·兰顿预测错了。

第三章


朱莉娅，被他的热情和慷慨激昂打动，接受了他的提议。起初，他让她出演一些小角色，在他的指导下，她像从未演过戏那样在舞台上表演。他让评论家对她感兴趣，然后对他们恭维奉承，让他们觉得自己发现了一位优秀的女演员，并且允许他们出面建议他让朱莉娅出演马格达。她红极一时，很快他就让她出演了《玩偶之家》中的娜拉，《人与超人》中的安，以及海达·加不勒。米德尔普尔的人们高兴地发现他们之中有一位女演员能让他们吹捧得比任何伦敦的明星都棒，并且出于家乡的荣誉感，都蜂拥去观看她出演的角色和戏剧。伦敦的短评记者也会不时地提到她，不少热情的戏剧赞助人也专程到米德尔普尔去观看她的表演。回来的人们对她赞不绝口，两三位伦敦戏院的经理派遣代表对她进行报道。他们对她持怀疑态度。她在萧伯纳和易卜生的戏剧里表现得非常好，但如果她出演的是一部普通戏剧呢？经理们曾有过不好的经历。他们基于某位男演员在类似的一部别具一格的戏剧中的精彩表演与他签了约，后来却发现在其他类型的剧目中他比其他演员好不到哪里去。

迈克尔加入剧团时，朱莉娅已经在米德尔普尔表演一年了。吉米开始让他出演萧伯纳《康蒂妲》中的马奇班克斯。吉米的这个选择让大家都很满意，因为对于这个角色而言，迈克尔的帅气是个加分项，而他表演缺乏热情也不会变成劣势。

朱莉娅伸手取出第一个纸盒，这里放着迈克尔的照片。她舒服地坐在地上，快速地翻过他早期的照片，寻找他初次来到米德尔普尔时拍的那张；但当她翻到这照片时，她的心被狠狠地刺痛了。她甚至觉得想要大哭起来。照片里的迈克尔就是他那时的模样。当时康蒂妲由一位年长的女人出演，她是一位优秀的女演员，经常出演母亲、老处女或反面角色，而朱莉娅除了一周出演八次外，没什么其他可做的，便观看他们排练。她对迈克尔一见钟情。她从来没有见过比他更帅的年轻小伙子，并且她不遗余力地追求他。没过多久，吉米不顾传统的米德尔普尔人的谴责，把《群鬼》搬上舞台，迈克尔饰演那个男孩，朱莉娅饰演丽贾纳。他们互相听对方背诵台词，排练过后小心翼翼地一起吃午饭，以免剧组其他人说他俩的闲话。很快他们便形影不离了。朱莉娅对迈克尔几乎没有保留，她疯狂地赞美迈克尔。他对自己的美貌并不自负，他知道自己长得很帅，接受相关的恭维，态度并非完全冷漠，而是好像这些赞美之词是对一座已经在他家族中存在很久的不错的老房子发出的。众所周知这座老房子是当时最好的房子之一，值得人们为之骄傲并好好保护，但它就在那儿，拥有它就如同一个人呼吸空气那样自然。他脑子很清醒，也很有抱负。他知道他的美貌是他目前主要的资产，但他知道容颜之美不会持久，因此决意成为一个好演员，这样他就有除了外表以外的东西可以依赖。他打算从吉米身上学习一切他能学到的，然后去伦敦。

“如果我办事精明，我可以让某个上了年纪的女人资助我当剧院经理。每个人都得成为自己的主人。这是赚钱发财的唯一途径。”

朱莉娅很快就发现迈克尔不太喜欢花钱，当他们一起吃午饭或者周日一起出游时，她都会付自己那部分费用。她不介意这个。她喜欢他算着钱用的习惯，而她自己有点大手大脚，总是迟一两周才能付清房租。她羡慕他，因为他讨厌欠债，虽然他挣得不多，但依旧每周都能存下一点。他着急着存够钱，这样在他去伦敦后，便不会因为钱的问题而不得不一有角色提供给他便接受下来，而是可以支撑他等到能让他一鸣惊人的角色。他父亲靠抚恤金生活，为了送他到剑桥读书做出了很大牺牲。他父亲不喜欢他走演员这条路，而且曾经很坚持这一点。

“如果你想成为演员，我可能无法阻止你，”他说道，“但不管怎样，我坚持你必须像上等人那样接受教育。”

当朱莉娅发现迈克尔的父亲是一位上校时相当满足。听迈克尔讲他的祖先在摄政时期如何在怀特府把家产输光让朱莉娅印象深刻，她喜欢迈克尔戴的那枚有野猪头的图章戒指，上面印着：犯我者必受惩。

“我觉得，比起长得像希腊的神，你的家庭更让你感到骄傲。”她开心地告诉他。

“任何人都能长得好看，”他回答道，脸上带着甜蜜的笑容，“但不是每个人都能出生于一个体面的家庭。告诉你实话，我很高兴我老爹是个绅士。”

朱莉娅鼓足了勇气。

“我父亲是个兽医。”

听到这话，迈克尔的脸僵硬了一下，但他立刻恢复原样，大笑起来。

“当然，这与一个人的父亲的职业并没有多大关系。我经常听我父亲谈起他部队的兽医。他当然也是一名军官。我父亲总说他是最好的兽医之一。”

迈克尔念过剑桥，这让朱莉娅很开心。他曾经代表他的学院参加过划船比赛，甚至有传言说他会被选入校划船队。

“我想戴上我的蓝色剑桥标志，应该会对我在台上有所帮助。我可以以此大做宣传。”

朱莉娅无法判断迈克尔是否知道她爱着他。他从不向她表达爱意。他喜欢她的社交圈，当他们跟别人在一起时，迈克尔很少会离开她身边。有时他们会被邀请去参加星期天的聚会，或者吃午餐，晚上吃顿丰盛的冷餐，他似乎认为他们一同赴约一起离开很正常。当他送她到家门口时，他会给她一个吻，但他吻她的样子与他吻那个和他共同出演《康蒂妲》的中年妇女没什么两样。他很友好，风趣幽默，亲切，但令人沮丧的是，对他来说，朱莉娅仅仅是他的伙伴。然而，她也知道，他没有爱上任何其他人。他会咯咯笑着向朱莉娅朗读那些女人写给他的情书，当她们给他献上鲜花，他会立刻转送给朱莉娅。

“真是一群笨蛋，”他说道，“她们这么做到底想得到什么呢？”

“我觉得答案没那么难猜。”朱莉娅冷淡地说道。

虽然她知道他一点都不在意这些，但她还是忍不住会感到生气和嫉妒。

“如果我跟某个米德尔普尔的女人混在一起，我就太蠢了。毕竟，她们大部分都是轻佻女子。在我还不知道怎么回事的时候，就会有气势汹汹的父亲寻过来，让我必须娶了这个女孩。”

朱莉娅试图打探当他在本森剧团时有没有风流韵事。她推测，有一两个姑娘有意和他扯上关系，但他认为与一同演戏的女演员鬼混在一起是一个极大的错误，这样的事一定会导致麻烦。

“你知道剧团的人是怎么说闲话的吧。所有人会在二十四小时里知道所有的秘密。你一旦开始了那样的事情，你无法预测自己会扯上什么事情。我可不会冒那种险。”

当他想找点乐子的时候，他会等他们在伦敦附近时，赶到伦敦，在全球饭店挑个姑娘。当然，这会很贵，而且回头想想，这个钱花得一点不值；此外，他在本森剧团时经常打板球，有机会也玩高尔夫，但这种东西对眼睛不太好。

朱莉娅撒了一个弥天大谎。

“吉米总是说，如果我能有点风流韵事，我会成为比现在更好的女演员。”

“你千万别信。他就是个肮脏的老男人。你说的风流韵事是跟他一起吧，我猜。我的意思是，这就好像是说，如果我会写诗，我就能把马奇班克斯演得更好。”

他们在一起聊了很多，最终，朱莉娅终于知道了迈克尔对于婚姻的看法。

“在我看来，一位选择早早结婚的演员简直就是个蠢货。太多例子说明婚姻会毁掉一位演员的前途。尤其是当他娶了位女演员。他成了一位明星，而她则成了他难以摆脱的重担。她会坚持与他一起演出，如果他是经理，他就不得不把女主角的位置给她；如果他和其他女人演戏，那情况就更糟糕了。当然，这对于女演员来讲也不理智。她可能会怀上孩子，因此不得不拒绝一个好角色。她会从公众眼睛中消失数月，你知道观众是什么德行，除非他们能一直见到你，否则他们就会忘记你的存在。”

婚姻？她在乎什么婚姻呢？她的心早已融化在他那双深邃而充满热情的眼睛里，看着他充满光泽的黄褐色头发她会因为欢快的痛苦而颤抖。只要他开口，她会乐意给他一切。然而，这种想法从未在他那可爱的脑子里出现过。

“他当然喜欢我，”她对她自己说道，“他喜欢我超过其他任何人，他甚至爱慕我，但我在那方面对他没有吸引力。”

她千方百计引诱他，就差钻到他的床上了，而她没有这么做的原因是因为没有机会。她开始害怕他们的关系会因为他们彼此太熟悉而无法有进一步发展，她咒骂自己没有在他们接触之初把关系推向高潮。他现在对她的感情太真诚了，不可能变成她的情人。她打探到他的生日，送给他一个金烟盒，她知道这是他最想要的东西。这礼物花了她不少钱，她很难负担得起，他笑着责备她太奢侈了。他无法想象，能够给他花钱这事儿让她欣喜若狂。她生日的时候他送了她半打长筒丝袜。她立刻注意到这些丝袜质量一般。可怜的家伙，他可舍不得买什么高档货。但她一想到他会送她礼物就情不自禁地哭了起来。

“真是个感情充沛的小东西。”他说道，但看到她流眼泪他很开心，也很感动。

她认为他的节俭是个迷人的特点。他忍受不了把自己的钱四处乱花掉。他并非真的吝啬，但他也不慷慨。有一两次她觉得他给服务员小费给得过少，但他对她的抗议不屑一顾。他就只给百分之十，当他拿不出正好的零钱时，他会让服务员找零给他。

“既不向别人借钱，也不借钱给别人。”他引用波洛涅斯的话。

当剧团的某个成员一时手头不宽裕，向他借钱都是徒劳。而他拒绝得那么坦率，那么诚恳，竟没有人会怪他。

“我亲爱的老朋友，我很想借给你一英镑，但我自己也没钱了。我都不知道这周末怎么付房租。”

有那么几个月，迈克尔对自己的角色太专注了，以至于他都没有注意到朱莉娅是多么棒的女演员。当然他会阅读剧评，看到他们对朱莉娅的赞美，他都一掠而过，直到读到这些评论家对他的评论才会多注意。他们的肯定让他感到开心，但他们的批评并没有让他气馁。他太谦虚了，并不会对一条负面批评感到气愤。

“我想我演得太糟糕了吧。”他发自内心地说道。

他身上最让人迷恋的特质是他的好脾气。他对吉米·兰顿的侮辱泰然受之。当吉米在一场长时间的排练中脾气越来越暴躁时，他却总能维持平静。跟他吵架简直是不可能的。一天他坐在台前观看一场没有他戏份的排练。这场戏以强大而感人的场景结尾，朱莉娅终于有机会好好展现自己的优秀演技。当舞台开始为下一场戏进行布景，朱莉娅穿过后台和舞台之间那扇门，在迈克尔身边坐下来。他没有对她说话，而是眼睛直勾勾地盯着前方。她惊讶地看了他一眼。他既没有对她微笑也没有跟她打招呼，这一点儿也不像他。然后，她看到他正咬紧牙关以防牙齿打战，他的眼睛里布满泪水。

“怎么了，亲爱的？”

“别跟我说话。你这个小婊子，你让我哭了。”

“我的天使！”

此刻，泪水充盈着她的双眼，顺着脸颊流了下来。她感到如此欣喜，如此荣幸。

“哦，可恶，”他抽泣道，“我忍不住！”

他从上衣口袋中掏出手帕，擦干了眼泪。

（“我爱他，我爱他，我爱他。”）

然后，他擤了擤鼻子。

“我感到好一些了。但是，上帝，你击垮了我。”

“这场戏还不错，对吧？”

“这场戏不怎么样，全都是你。你揪住了我的心。那些评论家说得很对，可恶，你是个名副其实的演员，错不了。”

“你是刚刚才发现吗？”

“我知道你很好，但我不知道你演得这么好。你让我们其他人相形见绌。你将会是个大明星。没什么能阻挡你。”

“好吧，那么你将是我戏里的男主角。”

“如果我能在一个伦敦戏院经理那儿得到这样的角色，简直就是天上掉馅饼。”

朱莉娅灵光一闪。

“那么，你自己必须做经理，让我做你戏里的女主角。”

他停顿了一下。他脑子转得没那么快，需要一些时间让这些想法沉淀在他脑子里。然后，他笑了。

“你知道，这个主意不错。”

他们在午饭的时候又把这事儿说了一遍。大部分时间是朱莉娅在说，迈克尔兴趣十足地听着。

“当然，能一直出演体面的角色的唯一途径就是开自己的剧院，”他说道，“我知道的。”

钱是个问题。他们讨论了他们至少需要多少钱才能开始实施计划。迈克尔认为最少得五千英镑。但他们如何才能募集到那么多的钱？当然，米德尔普尔的制造商们财源滚滚，但期望他们投五千英镑在几个只在地方上小有名声的年轻演员身上简直是痴心妄想。此外，他们都嫉妒伦敦。

“你得找你的有钱老太太。”朱莉娅开玩笑道。

其实，她对自己说的话半信半疑，但能和迈克尔讨论一个能增进她和迈克尔关系的计划让她兴奋不已。但迈克尔是非常认真的。

“我不觉得一个人能在伦敦取得成功，除非他已经名声在外。要做的事情应该是先在其他剧团表演三到四年；然后就能摸清楚门道了。这么做的优势在于有时间去读剧本。除非已经有了至少三个剧本，否则经营剧团简直就是疯子之举。而这三个剧本中必须有一个会获得成功。”

“当然如果这么做，就必须两人共同演出，这样公众会习惯于看到两个人的名字同时出现在节目单上。”

“我觉得这个关系不大。最好还是要有过硬的角色。当然，毫无疑问，如果能在伦敦积累一点名声，那么找赞助人会容易许多。”





第四章


复活节即将来临，吉米·兰顿会在节前的那一周关闭剧院。朱莉娅不知道自己要做什么；回泽西岛似乎不太值当。一天早上，她出乎意料地收到一封迈克尔的母亲格斯林太太的来信，信中说如果她能和迈克尔一起来切尔滕纳姆共度一周，这将会使上校和她无比欣喜。当她把这封信拿给迈克尔看时，他满脸是笑。

“我让她邀请你的。我觉得比起我直接带你去，那样会更加礼貌些。”

“你太好了。我当然愿意去。”

她欢欣鼓舞。即将与迈克尔共度整整一周让她欣喜若狂。在得知她假期无所事事的时候，他那副好心肠让他不得不帮着解决她的问题。但她看得出他还有其他事情要跟她说，可又不大说得出口。

“怎么了？”

迈克尔尴尬地笑了笑。

“亲爱的，你知道，我父亲非常传统，像他这样的人，有些事情是无法理解的。当然，我也不希望你撒谎，但我觉得如果他知道你父亲是一个兽医的话，他会觉得可笑。在我写信给他问能否带你前去的时候，我介绍你父亲是名医生。”

“噢，好吧。”

朱莉娅发现上校并没有她预想的那样令人不安。他身形消瘦，个头很矮，满脸皱纹，一头白发修理得极短。他高贵的面貌中透露着苍老，让人联想起一枚使用很久的旧硬币上的头像。他很礼貌，但也很内敛。他既不暴躁也不暴戾，一点不像朱莉娅凭借她的舞台经验所了解的上校那样。她无法想象他那客气得甚至有点冰冷的声音是如何施放号令的。事实上，他的军人生涯极其平凡，最后带着荣誉军衔退了役，许多年来，他都满足地过着在花园里劳作、在俱乐部打牌的生活。他读《泰晤士报》，星期日去教堂，陪着夫人去各种茶会。格斯林太太是一个个子高挑、身形敦实、上了年纪的女人。由于个子比她先生高出不少，她总是给你留下在试图缩小自己身高的印象。她风韵犹存，可以看得出年轻时一定很美丽。她头发中分，在颈背处低低地盘了个髻。她传统的外表再加上高大的身材，初次见面会让人觉得威风凛凛，但很快朱莉娅就发现实际上她非常腼腆。她的行动僵硬笨拙，穿着过于考究，带着一种老式的富态，但其实并不适合她。朱莉娅一点不尴尬，反倒觉得这个老女人不以为然的态度令人同情。她从未跟一个知名女演员说过话，对目前她所处的两难处境不知所措。房子很普通，是一幢位于花园里的独立的拉毛粉饰的房子，周围种满了月桂树。由于格斯林一家在印度待过几年，所以家里还有黄铜大盘子和黄铜碗，以及印度刺绣和雕刻繁复的印度桌子。这些都是廉价的集市货，不禁让人奇怪为什么有人会想把它们搬回家。

朱莉娅很机智。不久她就发现，虽然上校很少说话，格斯林太太也很腼腆，但其实他们都在观察她。迈克尔带她回家难道是为了让他父母审查她？这想法在她脑海中一闪而过。为什么呢？只可能有一个原因，而当她想到这个原因时，心脏怦怦直跳。看得出，他非常希望她能给他们留下一个好印象。她本能地觉得她必须掩饰自己女演员的身份，并且毫不费力地，没有任何做作地，仅仅因为她觉得这样会讨好他们，她扮演了那个简单的、谦虚的、天真的、过了一辈子乡村生活的女孩。她和上校绕着花园走了一圈，当上校说起豌豆或芦笋时，她听得趣味盎然；她与格斯林太太插花，擦洗起居室里塞得满满的各种摆设。格斯林太太跟她谈起迈克尔，告诉她他的表演如何机智，他多么受欢迎，还称赞他的外表。朱莉娅看出格斯林太太为自己的儿子感到非常骄傲，于是灵机一动，觉得如果让格斯林太太看到她神魂颠倒地爱着迈克尔，一定会让格斯林太太非常开心，但她要做得不露痕迹，就好像她希望保守这个秘密但却笨拙地出卖了自己。

“当然我们希望他表现得不错，”格斯林太太说，“我们不是很喜欢他走上舞台演戏；你看，我们双方都是军人家庭，但他很固执。”

“是的，我知道您的意思。”

“我知道，现在这个问题已经不像我年轻的时候那么重要了，但他毕竟生来就是个绅士。”

“哦，但很多出身很好的人现在都上台演戏了，您知道吗？现在不像从前了。”

“是，不像从前了。我很高兴他把你带到这里来。对此我本来有点紧张。我觉得你会化很浓的妆，可能还会有点吵闹。没人能想到你是个演员。”

（“我肯定不会这么认为。过去四十八小时我难道不是完美地出演了村姑吗？”）

上校也开始跟她开玩笑，有时还会开玩笑地捏她的耳朵。

“您可不能跟我调情，上校，”她大声说道，同时淘气、愉悦地看了他一眼，“难道您觉得我是个女演员您就能对我随随便便吗？”

“乔治，乔治。”格斯林太太笑道。然后她对朱莉娅说：“他一直都是个糟糕的调情者。”

（“天，我简直太受欢迎了。”）

格斯林太太跟她讲印度的事情，讲家里的下人们都是有色人种有多奇怪，但那边的社交圈却很美好，只有军人和印度上等人，可仍旧不像家里，以及她回到英国有多开心。

朱莉娅和迈克尔准备于复活节后的周一离开，因为他们那天晚上有演出。周日晚餐后，格斯林上校说他要去书房写一些信件；一两分钟后格斯林太太说她得去看看厨子。当他们都走后，迈克尔背对着壁炉火站着，点了支烟。

“我担心这里有点太安静了；希望你没有感到太无聊。”

“跟天堂一般。”

“你给我的家人留下了完美的印象。他们都非常喜欢你。”

“天哪，为此我付出了多少努力啊！”朱莉娅不禁这样想，同时她大声说道：“你是怎么知道的？”

“哦，我能看出来。爸爸告诉我你很有教养，一点都不像个女演员，妈妈说你非常通情达理。”

朱莉娅害羞地低下头，似乎这些恭维让她愧不敢当。迈克尔走过来，站在她前面。她突然觉得他看起来像一个帅气年轻的男仆在申请一份工作。他出奇地紧张。她的心脏在胸腔中怦怦乱跳。

“亲爱的朱莉娅，你愿意嫁给我吗？”

过去一周她一直在问自己他会不会求婚，现在，当他终于这么做了，她却感到迷茫。

“迈克尔！”

“我并不是说立刻。等我们做出点成绩的时候再结婚。我知道你的表演比我出色，但我们一见如故，而且当我们开始经营剧院的时候，我们会成为非常好的搭档。并且你知道，我确实非常喜欢你。我是说，我还没有遇见能与你相比的其他女人。”

（“这个笨蛋，为什么他要说这些没用的？难道他不知道我疯了一样地想嫁给他吗？为什么他不吻我，吻我，吻我？我在想我敢不敢告诉他我简直像着了魔一样爱着他。”）

“迈克尔，你这么帅气，没人能够拒绝你的求婚。”

“亲爱的！”

（“我最好站起来。他可不知道怎么坐下。天，那场吉米不断让他重复的戏！”）

她站了起来，与迈克尔面对面。他拥抱了她，吻了她的嘴唇。

“我得告诉妈妈。”

他离开了她，奔向门口。

“妈妈，妈妈！”

不久，上校和格斯林太太都走了进来。他们脸上洋溢着快乐而期待的表情。

（“天，简直就是个圈套。”）

“妈妈，爸爸，我们订婚了。”

格斯林太太哭了起来。她迈着笨拙的步子走到朱莉娅面前，伸手抱住了她，然后开始抽泣，亲吻她。上校则像男人那样紧紧握了一下他儿子的手，然后把朱莉娅从他妻子怀抱中拉出来，也亲吻了一下。他被深深地感动了。所有这些情感让朱莉娅激动，虽然她开心地微笑，但眼泪顺着脸颊流了下来。迈克尔看着这动人的场景，感同身受。

“我们来开香槟庆祝一下如何？”他说道，“我看妈妈和朱莉娅都太激动了。”

“女士们，上帝保佑她们。”上校在斟满酒后说道。





第五章


此刻，朱莉娅翻到了她穿婚纱的照片。

“上帝，我的样子看起来真怪。”

他们决定不对外公开他们订婚的消息，除了吉米·兰顿和两三个剧团里的女孩还有她的服装师，朱莉娅谁都没说。虽然她让他们发誓保守秘密，但这消息还是在四十八小时内传遍了整个剧团。朱莉娅非常开心。她对迈克尔的爱更加强烈了，甚至愿意此时此刻就开心地举办婚礼。但迈克尔一直都很理智。现在，他们不过是一对地方上的演员，若是作为一对结了婚的夫妻，这对他们征战伦敦可没什么好处。朱莉娅非常明确地暗示迈克尔，她很愿意做他的情人，但他拒绝了。他是个正人君子，不愿意占她便宜。

“亲爱的，如果我不崇尚荣誉，我不会这么爱你。”他引用道。

他非常确定，如果在结婚前他们就住在一起，结婚后一定会后悔。朱莉娅为迈克尔的节操感到很骄傲。他是个亲切而深情的爱人，但不久迈克尔就不再把她当回事儿了；他的举止，友好但很随意，会让你觉得他们已经结婚好多年了。但他允许朱莉娅向他示爱。她喜欢蜷在他身边，让他的胳膊搂着自己的腰，脸贴着脸，而她最幸福的时刻就是将自己充满渴望的嘴唇贴压在他那有点单薄的嘴唇上。当他们并排坐着，虽然他更喜欢讨论他们所演的角色或者一起为未来作打算，但这仍旧让她非常开心。对于赞美他的外表，她从不感到厌倦。当她告诉迈克尔他的鼻子多么精致，他那一头拳曲的黄褐色头发多么可爱时，朱莉娅能感受到他更加用力的拥抱并看到他眼中的柔情，这对她来讲如天堂一般美妙。

“亲爱的，你会让我像孔雀那样忘乎所以的。”

“但假意说你没那么帅气是多么愚蠢的事情啊。”

朱莉娅确实这么认为，她这么说自然是因为她喜欢这样表达，但同时也是因为她知道他喜欢听这些。他对她也有感情和崇拜，他与她相处轻松，对她有信任感，但她很清楚他并不爱她。她安慰自己，迈克尔已经尽他所能地爱她了，而且她觉得当他们结婚后，睡在一起，她会用她的热情感染他，激发起他同样的热情。同时，她不断练习自己的机智圆滑和自我控制。她知道她不能让他觉得自己无趣。她也知道她绝不能让他感到自己是个负担或者是一份责任。他可能会为了一场高尔夫游戏或是为了与一个偶然相识的人吃顿午餐就对她不管不顾，然而，她丝毫不会让他感受到自己心中的不悦。当她察觉到她作为一位女演员所取得的成功会强化他对她的感情时，朱莉娅便更加努力地演好戏。

在他们订婚一年后，一个正寻找演员的美国经理听说了吉米·兰顿的轮演剧目剧团后，来到米德尔普尔，便被迈克尔吸引。他递给迈克尔一张便条，邀请他第二天下午到自己所在的酒店见面。迈克尔激动得不能呼吸，当即拿了纸条给朱莉娅看；这唯一的解释就是那位美国经理会邀请他出演一个角色。她的心沉了下来，但她假装跟他一样兴奋，第二天和他一起来到酒店。当迈克尔和那位伟人见面的时候，她在酒店大厅等着。

“祝我好运，”当他转身离开朱莉娅走进电梯的时候，他悄悄说道，“这简直太好了，都不像是真的。”

朱莉娅坐在一个大的皮制扶手椅中，满心希望那个美国经理所提供的角色会遭到迈克尔的拒绝，或者工资太低让迈克尔无法接受。或者他会让迈克尔朗读那个角色的台词，然后发现迈克尔无法诠释这个角色。但半小时后，当她看到迈克尔朝她走来，双眼发亮，步履轻快，她就知道他成功了。那一刻她感到自己要吐了，当她强迫自己展现一个热情洋溢的微笑时，她感到自己的肌肉都是僵硬的。

“一切都很好。他说这是一个非常棒的角色，饰演一个男孩，十九岁。会在纽约上演八到十周，然后是巡演。会跟约翰·德鲁一起工作四十周。一周二百五十美金。”

“哦，宝贝，对你来说这简直太好了。”

很明显他很快就接受了这个邀请。拒绝这个想法从来没有在他脑子里出现过。

“那我，我，”她想，“即便有人一周给我一千美金，如果需要我跟迈克尔分开，我也不会同意的。”

浓重的绝望笼罩了她。她什么都做不了。她必须假装和他一样开心。他激动得甚至无法安静地坐着，拉着她走入外面拥挤的街道。

“这是个绝佳的机会。当然，美国花费高，但一周五十美金应该够我花销了，他们说美国人都非常好客，那么我应该能吃到不少免费餐食。我觉得这四十周里我能存下八千美金，这是一千六百英镑啊。”

（“他不爱我。他一点都不在乎我。我恨他。我想杀了他。让那美国经理见鬼去吧。”）

“如果他第二年还聘用我，我一周会有三百美金。这就是说只用两年我就能存四千英镑了，几乎够开剧院的钱了。”

“第二年！”朱莉娅差点失去控制，她的声音带着浓重的哭腔，“难道你说你会离开两年吗？”

“哦，当然我明年夏天会回来。他们会付我回来的路费，这样我就可以住在家里，没有什么开销。”

“我不知道没有你我怎么办。”

她说这些话时语气欢快，听起来像是奉承，但口吻很随意。

“夏天我们会有不少时间在一起，而且你知道的，在外面一两年时间会一晃而过。”

迈克尔漫无目的地走着，但朱莉娅神不知鬼不觉地把他领到她希望他去的地方，现在他们来到剧团门口。她停了下来。

“我们一会儿见。我得去找吉米。”他的脸沉了下来。

“你现在不能离开我！我必须找人说会话。我以为趁戏还没开始我们可以一起去吃点东西。”

“我十分抱歉。吉米要见我，你知道他是什么样的人。”

迈克尔冲她甜蜜而和蔼地笑了笑。

“好吧，那你去吧。我不会因为一次让我失望就生你的气的。”

他径直走入剧院，而她从后台入口也进入剧院。吉米·兰顿在屋顶下给自己安排了一个极小的公寓，从阳台可以进去。她按响门铃，吉米为她开了门。他有点惊讶，但很高兴见到她。

“你好，朱莉娅，请进。”

她一句话也没说，径直从他身旁走过。当他们来到杂乱无比的客厅时，发现四处都是剧本文件、书和其他垃圾，桌子旁的餐盘上还有他剩余的简单午餐。她转过身，面对着他，下巴绷得紧紧的，眉头紧蹙。

“你这个魔鬼！”

她动作敏捷地走向他，双手抓住了他解开的衬衫领子，用力摇晃他。他试图从她手里挣脱，但朱莉娅很强壮凶猛。

“停下来。停下来！”

“你这个魔鬼，畜生，肮脏下流的男人。”

他挥拳出击，摊开手掌重重地扇了她一巴掌。她本能地松开了抓着他的双手，捂着脸颊，她被他打疼了，顿时大哭起来。

“你这个畜生。你竟然卑鄙下流到对一个女人动手。”

“亲爱的，收起你那些废话。你难道不知道，如果有个女人打我，我肯定会还手的吗？”

“我没有打你。”

“你他妈的差点掐死我。”

“你活该。上帝啊，我简直想要杀了你。”

“现在，坐下来，我给你倒点酒，你平静一下。然后，你可以告诉我到底怎么了。”

朱莉娅在四周寻找一张能让她轻松地陷进去的大椅子。

“上帝，这地方就像个猪圈。你为什么就不能找个做家务的女人来收拾一下？”

她生气地把堆在椅子上的书全部推到了地板上，然后一屁股坐下，开始伤心地哭起来。吉米为她倒了一杯烈性威士忌，加了一点苏打水，让她喝了下去。

“朱莉娅，所有这些托斯卡(1)似的行为到底是为了什么？”

“迈克尔要去美国了。”

“是吗？”

她挣脱了他搭在她肩上的胳膊，“你怎么能这么做？你怎么能这么做？”

“这跟我一点关系都没有。”

“一派谎言。我想你甚至不知道那个可恶的美国经理来到米德尔普尔了吧。当然是你搞的鬼。你这么做就是为了故意拆散我们。”

“哦，亲爱的，你误解我了。事实上我不介意告诉你，我跟他说的是他可以从剧团里挑选任何他喜欢的人，除了迈克尔·格斯林。”

当吉米说这些话的时候，朱莉娅并没有看他的眼神，但如果她看了的话一定会想为什么吉米看上去那么开心，仿佛他的小诡计得逞了一样。

“包括我？”她说道。

“我知道他不会选女演员的。他们已经有很多女演员了。他们想要男演员，那种能展示他们的戏服并且不会在客厅随地吐痰的男演员。”

“哦，吉米，别让迈克尔走。我受不了。”

“我如何阻止得了？他的合同到这个演出季末就结束了。而且对他来说这是个千载难逢的好机会。”

“但我爱他。我想要他。假设他在美国遇到其他人呢。假设某个美国有钱的女继承人爱上了他呢。”

“如果他不再像我想象的那样爱你，你最好离开他。”

这句话又激起了朱莉娅的怒火。

“你这个恶心的太监，你对爱情知道什么？”

“这些女人啊，”吉米叹气道，“如果你试图跟她们上床，她们说你是肮脏的老男人；如果你不跟她们上床，她们说你是恶心的老太监。”

“你不明白。他那么英俊，她们会一批批地拜倒在他脚下，可怜的家伙，他那么容易被奉承话影响。两年里什么都有可能发生。”

“怎么是两年？”

“如果他成功的话，他会再待一年。”

“那你千万别为这个担心。他会在演出季结束的时候回来的，而且是永远回来。那个经理只看过他出演《康蒂妲》。这是唯一他演得还说得过去的角色。我的话搁在这里，用不了多久他们就会发现他们签了一个木偶。他会让他们大跌眼镜的。”

“关于表演你又懂什么？”

“一切。”

“我想挖出你的眼睛来。”

“我警告你，如果你再动我一下，我就不会只是扇你嘴巴了，我会给你下巴来一记重拳，让你至少一周都不能舒服地吃饭。”

“上帝，我相信你能做得出来。你还能算得上一位绅士吗？”

“即便我喝醉也不会是位绅士。”

朱莉娅咯咯笑了，这让吉米觉得最糟糕的场面已经过去了。

“现在你同我一样清楚，你的演技远远在他之上。我告诉你，你将是继肯德尔夫人(2)之后最伟大的女演员。为什么要让一个永远会是你负担的男人阻碍你？如果你经营剧院，他会想跟你演对手戏。亲爱的，他永远配不上你。”

“他有帅气的外表。我会带着他。”

“你对自己很有信心是吗？但你错了。如果你想成功，你就不能让一个不够格的男主角跟你搭档。”

“我不在乎。比起成功然后嫁给别人，我宁愿嫁给他然后失败。”

“你是处女吗？”

朱莉娅又咯咯笑了。

“我不知道这关你什么事，但我确实是。”

“我也觉得你是。那么，除非你有什么顾虑，在我们停演后，为什么你不跟他一起去巴黎待两周？他到八月才会去美国。这样你就可以对他放心了。”

“他不会的。他不是那种人。你看，他是个正人君子。”

“即使是上等人也要繁衍后代。”

“你不明白。”朱莉娅傲然地说。

“我敢打赌你也不明白。”

朱莉娅不屑于回答他。她非常不开心。

“我跟你讲，离开他我无法生活。当他离开了，我自己怎么办？”

“继续跟着我。我会与你签一年合同。我有很多新角色想让你尝试，而且我已经找到一个年轻演员，是个新秀。当你跟一个与你有回应有共鸣的家伙一起演戏，你会惊奇地发现表演原来这么容易。你一周可以拿十二英镑。”

朱莉娅向他走去，目光锐利地盯着他的眼睛。

“你是不是为了让我再待一年而这么做的？你是不是故意伤我的心、毁了我的生活，就是为了让我待在你这腐朽的剧院里？”

“我发誓我没有。我喜欢你，钦佩你。我们的生意从未像过去两年里这样好。但该死的，我不会对你玩那么肮脏的手段。”

“你这个骗子，肮脏的骗子。”

“我发誓这都是事实。”

“证明给我看。”她激动地说。

“我如何证明给你看？你知道我是很体面的人。”

“给我一周十五英镑，我就信你。”

“一周十五英镑？你知道我们的收入是多少。我如何能给你那么多？好吧。但我会自己掏腰包给你那三英镑。”

“我才不管呢。”

第六章


经过两周的排练后，原定由迈克尔出演的角色不再需要他饰演，之后的三四周他无所事事，等待有什么角色能够让他演。没过多久他就登台演出了，但那部剧只在纽约上演不到一个月。这部剧原本也要进行巡演；但由于不景气被撤掉了。在又一轮等待后，剧团让他出演一部戏剧中的角色，这样他好看的外表能发挥最大优势，而他的冷冰冰的表演则不太会被注意到，他以这部剧结束了这个演出季。没有人提起过要与他续约的事情。事实上，雇用他的那位经理对他的评价很刻薄。

“天，我得给那个兰顿点颜色看看，狗娘养的，”他说道，“当他把那根木头杵给我的时候，他很清楚自己在做什么。”

朱莉娅经常给迈克尔写信，长篇的情话和闲话，而迈克尔一周回一封信，不长不短端端正正就四页纸。他总是以致她最好的爱结尾，并在签名前写上“你亲爱的”，但信件的其他部分更多是告知性的，缺乏情感。然而，她还是在痛苦的焦虑中等待这些信的到来，然后把它们读了一遍又一遍。虽然他写得很开心，几乎不说戏院的事情，除了他们给他的角色都很糟糕，要出演的那些戏剧都不值一提，但戏剧界消息传得很快，朱莉娅知道他的进展并不顺利。

“我这么想可能很恶毒，”她想，“但谢天谢地，谢天谢地。”

当迈克尔告诉她回程的日期时，她简直无法抑制自己内心的喜悦。她让吉米把她的演出安排好，以便她能去利物浦接他。

“如果船到晚了，我可能会待一晚。”她告诉吉米。

他讽刺地笑了笑。

“我想你肯定认为借着回家的兴奋之情你能实施你的诡计了。”

“你真是个可恶的小人。”

“别装了，亲爱的。我给你的建议就是，把他灌醉，然后把你同他锁在一间屋子里，告诉他除非让你成了他的女人，否则你不会让他出去的。”

朱莉娅启程时，吉米陪她去了车站。当她要上火车时，他握着她的手，拍了拍。

“紧张吗，亲爱的？”

“哦，亲爱的吉米，我欣喜若狂，同时又万分焦虑。”

“那么，祝你好运。千万别忘了，他一点都配不上你。你年轻，漂亮，还是英国最棒的女演员。”

当火车驶离车站，吉米去了车站的酒吧，要了一杯威士忌苏打。“上帝，这些凡人何等愚蠢。”他叹息道。朱莉娅站在空空如也的车厢里，看着镜子里的自己。

“嘴巴太大，脸太肥，鼻子肉太多。谢谢上帝，我眼睛还算漂亮，腿也长得不错。非常精致的腿。我是不是妆化得有点浓。他不喜欢下了舞台还化妆。不涂腮红的话我看上去就太惨了。我的睫毛还可以。管它呢，我看起来还不错。”

因为直到最后一刻都不能确定吉米会不会让她休假，朱莉娅并没有告诉迈克尔她会去接他。见到朱莉娅，迈克尔感到很意外，也非常开心。他那双漂亮的眼睛充满快乐的光芒。

“你比之前更加可爱了。”她说道。

“哦，别说这傻话了，”他笑道，深情地捏着她的胳膊，“你可以吃完晚饭后再回去，是吗？”

“我可以明天再回去。我已经在阿德尔菲酒店订了两个房间，这样晚饭后我们可以好好谈谈。”

“阿德尔菲酒店有点过于奢侈了吧，不是吗？”

“哦，你又不是天天从美国回来。管它花多少钱呢。”

“你真是个奢侈的小东西。我不知道我们什么时候到岸，所以我告诉我家人等我到了切尔滕纳姆我会给他们发电报。我会跟他们说我明天去那儿。”

当他们到达酒店，迈克尔来到朱莉娅的房间，像朱莉娅建议的那样，这样他们能安静地说会话。她坐在他膝盖上，胳膊缠绕在他的脖子上，她的脸紧贴着迈克尔的脸。

“哦，回到家真是太好了。”她感叹道。

“不用你说。”他说道，并没有理解她指的是他的怀抱，而不是他的到来。

“你还喜欢我吗？”

“当然。”

她温柔地亲吻他。

“哦，你不知道我是如何思念你。”

“我在美国的表现让人大跌眼镜，”他说道，“我没有在信里告诉你，因为我想这会让你担心。他们认为我的演技糟糕透了。”

“迈克尔。”她叫道，好像无法相信他刚刚说的话。

“事实上，我觉得我可能太英式了。他们不愿再跟我续签一年的合同。我不认为他们会跟我续签，但我还是按惯例问了问他们是否愿意，他们坚决地拒绝了我，任何价钱都不考虑。”

朱莉娅沉默了。她看起来非常担心，但她的心脏因狂喜而怦怦欢跳。

“我真的不介意，你知道的。我不喜欢美国。当然，不可否认，我碰了一鼻子灰，但唯一能做的就是笑一笑然后忍耐。要是你认识我必须要打交道的那些人就好了。因为与他们之中的一些人相比，吉米·兰顿是个很好的绅士。即使他们想和我续约，我也会拒绝的。”

虽然他将这件事说得很轻巧，但当时朱莉娅还是感到他受到了沉重的打击。他肯定忍受了不少不愉快的事情。她讨厌看到他被折磨得这么不开心，但，天哪，她如释重负。

“你现在打算怎么办？”她静静地问道。

“我打算先回家，然后整理一下头绪。然后我会去伦敦，看看能否拿到一个角色。”

她知道让他回到米德尔普尔没有意义。吉米·兰顿不会要他。

“我想，你不会想跟我一起去吧？”

朱莉娅简直不相信自己的耳朵。

“我？亲爱的，你知道我会跟你去这世界上任何一个地方。”

“你的合同得到这个演出季末才结束，如果你想换个地方你一定得去伦敦尝试一下。在美国，我存下我能存的每一分钱，他们叫我吝啬鬼，但我不在意，他们尽管去说。我带回来差不多一千两百到一千五百英镑。”

“迈克尔，你究竟是怎么存了这么多钱的？”

“我不怎么花钱，你知道的，”他开心地笑了笑，“当然，这点钱不够开剧场，但足够结婚了。我是说，如果我们无法一下子就有角色或者我们几个月没有工作，我们至少还有这些钱可以用着。”

朱莉娅花了一两秒才明白他的意思。

“你是说，我们现在就结婚吗？”

“当然这么做有点冒险，未来一片空白，但人总得时不时冒冒险。”

朱莉娅双手捧着迈克尔的脸，亲吻了他的唇。然后，她叹了口气。

“亲爱的，你太好了，你同希腊之神一样美好，但你是我这辈子认识的最大的傻瓜。”

当晚他们去剧院看了表演，晚饭的时候喝了香槟，庆祝他们的重逢，为他们的未来干杯。当迈克尔送她回到她房间时，她冲他抬起头。

“你想让我在走廊里跟你说晚安吗？我就进去待一会儿。”

“最好不要，亲爱的。”她庄重而娴静地说道。

她感觉自己如同大家闺秀一般，要维护古老望族的所有传统；她的纯洁如同一颗价格不菲的珍珠；她还感到自己给迈克尔留下了一个非常好的印象：他当然是正人君子，“该死”，她自然也应该是位高贵的淑女。她对自己的表现满意极了，当她走进自己的房间，锁门的时候发出一些响动。她开始在房间里大摇大摆地走来走去，优雅地向想象中的那些奉承的随从点头致意。她伸出自己如百合般雪白的手，让颤抖的老仆人亲吻（当她还是婴儿的时候，他总是把她放在膝盖上逗弄），当他那苍白的嘴唇贴上她的手时，她感到什么东西掉在了手上。那是一滴眼泪。





第七章


幸亏迈克尔性情冷淡，否则他们结婚第一年就应该已经吵得不可开交了。只有在迈克尔获得一个角色或者前天晚上欢快的聚会上他喝了几杯香槟后，才能让迈克尔那满脑子的务实思想转变成谈情说爱的思维。如果第二天与别人有约或者是要打高尔夫，他需要保持大脑清醒，那么任何谄媚和诱惑对他都不起作用。朱莉娅在他面前歇斯底里。她嫉妒他的那些绿屋俱乐部的朋友，嫉妒那些把他从她身边带走的体育运动，还嫉妒他打着建立人脉的名义而参加的男人们的聚餐。最让她怒不可遏的是当自己泪流满面大哭大闹的时候，他却极其平静地坐在那里，握着双手，帅气的脸上呈现好脾气的微笑，好像她做的一切只不过是让自己看起来无理取闹。

“你不会觉得我在追求别的女人吧？”他问道。

“我怎么知道？很明显你一点都不在乎我。”

“你知道在我的世界里唯一的女人就是你。”

“上帝！”

“我不知道你想要什么。”

“我想要爱。我以为我嫁给了全英国最帅的男人，而实际上我嫁了一个布偶。”

“别犯傻了。我与其他正常的英国男人没什么两样。我不是意大利的街头手风琴师。”

她在家里走来走去。他们在白金汉门附近有一套小公寓，虽然空间不大，但她极尽所能将它布置得漂亮一些。她朝天空张开双臂。

“我难道是斜眼或是驼背吗？我老到五十岁了吗？我就这么对你没有吸引力？乞求被爱简直是奇耻大辱。痛苦，痛苦。”

“这个动作很好，亲爱的，活像你在投板球。记住这个姿势。”

她瞥了他一下，眼神中充满不屑。

“你就只会想这些。我的心碎了，而你却在讲我偶然间做出的一个动作。”

但他从她的表情看出，她正在将这个姿势添加到记忆里。他知道，时机合适时，她会巧妙地利用到这个动作。

“毕竟爱情不是一切。当时机、地点合适时，爱情非常美妙。我们蜜月的时候很开心，那就是蜜月的意义，但现在我们必须开始工作。”

他们很幸运，设法在同一部剧中拿到了不错的角色，这部戏剧后来很成功。其中，朱莉娅有一场戏让她大显身手，赢得了满堂喝彩，而迈克尔令人震惊的美貌也引起了观众的注意。凭借他的绅士风度和谈笑风生的温雅气质，迈克尔让他们俩获得不少曝光机会，他们的照片被刊登在一些画报上。他们还接到很多宴会的邀请。虽然迈克尔非常节俭，花钱款待那些可能对他们有帮助的人却从不犹豫。朱莉娅对他在这些场合表现出的慷慨大方印象深刻。一位演员兼剧院经理邀请朱莉娅出演他下部戏的女主角，没有给迈克尔角色，朱莉娅想拒绝这个邀请，但迈克尔没有应允。他说，工作上他们不能感情用事。最终，他在一部古装戏里获得一个角色。

战争爆发时他们都在演出。让朱莉娅感到既骄傲又痛苦的是，迈克尔即将入伍。他父亲的一位老战友在战争办公室身居要职，于是在他父亲的帮助下，迈克尔很快就拿到了委任状。当他远赴法国前线，朱莉娅为曾经对他的那些责骂深深后悔，并下定决心，如果他战死疆场，她便自杀。她想成为一名护士，这样便能一起去法国，至少可以同他在一片土地上，但迈克尔让她明白，国家需要她继续表演，而她无法拒绝这个或许是他死前的最后愿望。迈克尔在战争中如鱼得水。他在团部集体中很受欢迎，旧部队的军官们很快就接纳了他，一点都不嫌弃他曾是个演员。似乎军人家庭的背景已经给他烙上了印记，他本能地就像职业军人那样做事和思考。他行为缜密，性格随和，又懂得如何灵活地运用关系；因而他势必成为某位将军的参谋部成员。他展现了出色的组织能力，在总司令部里度过了战争的最后三年。最后他被晋升为少校，荣获战功十字勋章和荣誉军团勋章。

与此同时，朱莉娅演了一连串重要的角色，已经被公认为最优秀的年轻女演员。整个战争期间，剧院非常繁忙，由于她出演长期上演的戏剧，获益不少，工资上涨。在迈克尔的建议下，她让极不情愿的剧院经理付给她八十英镑的周薪。迈克尔会在假期的时候回到英国，那时，朱莉娅会极度开心。虽然他在法国并不比在新西兰放羊更危险，但朱莉娅每次都会将这些时光当作迈克尔在这世上的最后时光来度过。她对他更加的温柔体贴、宽容，就好像他刚刚从战壕中回来一样。

然而，就在战争结束之前，她对他的爱意消失了。

那时她怀孕了。迈克尔认为把孩子生下来的做法不明智，但她已经快三十岁了，如果他们想要小孩，就不能再拖延了；她在这一行里已站稳了脚跟，消失几个月应该没什么问题，再加上迈克尔随时可能客死他乡——虽然他说过他非常安全，但他这么说仅仅是为了安慰她，而且有的时候连将军们也会死掉——如果她想在迈克尔战死后继续活下去，她必须有他们的孩子作为依靠。这个婴儿会在年底出生。

她从未像这样期待过迈克尔放假回英国。虽然她自我感觉良好，但她极其渴望感受他的拥抱，她感到有点迷茫、无助，她想要迈克尔保护她。他回来了，穿着合身的制服，肩章上的红标和皇冠格外显眼，他看起来英俊极了。总司令部的艰难困苦让他长胖了不少，他的皮肤晒黑了。剪短的头发，风趣的个性，还有军人的举止，让他各个方面看起来都像极了军人。他心情很好，不仅因为可以回家待几天，还因为战争即将结束。他打算尽快离开部队。当你还有点影响力的时候，如果不利用它，那它又有什么用？那么多年轻演员离开舞台去参军，要么出于爱国情结，要么被国内人民的爱国情结胁迫，于是这些主角角色就落在不适合服兵役或者严重受伤不得不被遣返的人的头上。此刻出现了一个绝佳的空档时期，迈克尔知道，如果他能尽快复员，他就能选择自己喜欢的角色。当他再次回到公众的视线时，他们就可以开始寻找一家剧院了，凭借朱莉娅目前的名望，他们可以开始自己经营了。

他俩聊到深夜，然后上床睡觉。她放荡地蜷缩在他怀里，他双手抱住了她。三个月的禁欲让他欲火焚身。

“你是最棒的妻子。”他喃喃道。

他把嘴贴到她的嘴上。她突然有了一阵淡淡的反感。她不得不强忍着才没把他推开。之前，在她多情的鼻孔里，他的身体，那年轻美丽的身体，似乎有鲜花和蜂蜜的香味，这是她迷恋他的原因之一。然而，现在，这种味道奇怪地消失了。她意识到，他闻起来不再像个少年，而是个男人。她感到有点恶心。她无法回应他的热情，她希望他的欲望能尽快得到满足，然后扭过身去睡觉。她躺在床上，久久未能入睡。她感到失望沮丧。她的心沉了下去，因为她知道，她丢失了对她而言非常珍贵的东西，她可怜自己，有大哭的冲动；但同时，她内心充满胜利的感觉，似乎是对曾经他给她带来那么多不愉快的一种报复；她终于摆脱了迷恋他的感情束缚，扬扬得意起来。现在，她可以和他平起平坐了。她在床上伸了伸腿，如释重负地叹了口气。

“上帝啊，做自己的主人真好。”

他们在屋里吃了早饭，朱莉娅靠在床上，迈克尔坐在她身边的一张小桌子旁。她看着他读报纸。三个月的时间可能让他发生这么大的变化吗？要不就是这么多年来，她还一直把他视为那个刚来米德尔普尔舞台上排练的英俊少年，自那时起她便被迷得神魂颠倒？他仍旧很潇洒，毕竟他只有三十六岁，但他不再是个男孩了；一头短发，经受了风吹日晒的皮肤，细细的皱纹开始爬上他光洁的额头和眼睛下方，他绝对已经是个男人了。他失去了那小马般的魅力，他的行为也已定型。虽然每次的变化都很小，但放到一起后，在她那敏锐、精明的双眼里，就成了巨大的变化。他是一个中年男人了。

他们还住在刚来伦敦时住的那套小公寓里。虽然朱莉娅挣了不少钱，但那时迈克尔在服兵役，也就没有任何搬家的需求。但现在他们要迎来一个婴儿，这个公寓显然太小了。朱莉娅在摄政公园附近找了一所她非常喜欢的房子。她想赶紧搬过去，在那里坐月子。

房子面朝花园。一层是会客厅，二层有两间卧室，三层的两间屋子可以改成白天和夜间的婴儿房。迈克尔对一切都很满意；连价格他都认为合理。在过去四年里，朱莉娅挣的钱比迈克尔多了不知多少，因而她主动提出要自己掏钱装修房子。他们站在一间卧室里。

“我可以用原来卧室的家具凑合，”她说道，“我会去梅谱尔家具店给你置办一套好家具。”

“我不想花太多钱，”他笑道，“我估计不会太经常使用它，你知道的。”

他想和她睡在一张床上。虽然没有激情，但他是温柔亲切的，而且他对他们肉体相依有种动物般的欲望。很长的时间里，这是她最大的慰藉。现在，这想法却让她愤怒不已。

“哦，我觉得在孩子出生前我们不能再乱来了。直到我生完孩子，我打算让你自己睡。”

“我没想到这点。如果你觉得这样对孩子好的话……”





第八章


迈克尔在战争结束的那一刻就复员了，紧接着就接演了一个角色。再次回到舞台的他，比起离开舞台时，演技大有长进。他在军队中练就的风趣在舞台上很有效。他是个身体健壮、生气活泼的正常人，总是笑容满面，有时哈哈大笑。他很适合出演发生在会客室的喜剧。他那轻柔的声音让一句挑逗的台词有了特殊效果，虽然他从未让求爱戏看起来逼真，但他能很好地演绎打趣的爱情戏，把求婚演得像笑话，或者讲一段爱情告白时更像是在自我嘲笑，他的表演方式让观众们产生兴趣。他从不试图表演除他以外的人。他擅长演花花公子、绅士般的赌棍、禁卫军官兵和生性善良的年轻坏蛋。经理们也喜欢他。他工作非常努力，并且听从指挥。只要他能接到角色，他并不在意演的是什么。他力争他认为合适的薪金，但如果达不到，那么少些也行，总比闲着强。

他仔细地做自己的计划。战争结束后的第一个冬天暴发了一场流感。他的父亲和母亲都在流感中死亡。他继承了大约四千英镑，再加上他和朱莉娅的储蓄，他们有了七千英镑。但剧院的租金同时也上涨了许多，演员的工资和舞台工作人员的薪水也都增加了，这意味着经营剧院的花销比战前多了许多。原本足够开剧院的钱现在却显得捉襟见肘。唯一的方法就是找一个有钱人和他们一起入伙，这样即使一开始出现一两次失败的经历也不会把他们逐出这圈子。据说，你总能在城市里找到个傻瓜开张数目不小的支票让你制作一部戏剧，但当你谈到实际问题时，你发现，他们的一个重要条件是得让他们感兴趣的某位漂亮女演员来出演主角。多年前，迈克尔和朱莉娅开玩笑说会有个有钱的老女人爱上迈克尔并出钱让他开剧院。他早就知道，没有哪个富有的老女人会出钱让一个妻子是个女演员的年轻男演员经营剧院的，尤其是他对妻子还绝对忠诚。最后，确实有一位有钱的女人掏了这笔钱，然而她并不老，让她感兴趣的人也不是迈克尔，而是朱莉娅。

德·弗里斯太太是个寡妇。她矮小敦实，长着精致的犹太人的鼻子和眼睛，充满活力，性格既奔放又懦弱，还有些男子汉的气概。她对舞台充满热情，在吉米·兰顿的轮演剧目剧团看似要被迫关门的时候几次慷慨解囊。于是，在朱莉娅和迈克尔决定在伦敦碰碰运气时，吉米·兰顿写信给她，希望她能给予他们帮助。她在米德尔普尔看过朱莉娅的表演。她为他们举办宴会，让这对年轻的演员有机会认识剧院经理，并邀请他们在她吉尔福德附近的豪华大房子里住下来，他们在那里享受到做梦都没想过的奢侈生活。她不太喜欢迈克尔。朱莉娅经常收到多莉·德·弗里斯送来的鲜花，她用鲜花填满朱莉娅的公寓和化妆间，她还送朱莉娅很多礼物，例如包包、小手袋、次等宝石串成的项链、胸针等。朱莉娅自然很开心，但她只把多莉的慷慨归因于她喜欢她的才华。当迈克尔去了前线，多莉提出让朱莉娅搬到她在蒙塔古广场的别墅中居住，朱莉娅拒绝了，并表达了她极度的感谢之情。多莉叹了口气，掉了滴眼泪，更加爱慕她。当罗杰出生时，朱莉娅请她做孩子的教母。

有段时间，迈克尔一直在想多莉·德·弗里斯出这笔钱的可能性，但他非常明白，虽然她会为了朱莉娅同意这么做，但是朱莉娅不会为了他而这么做。朱莉娅拒绝向她求助。

“她对我们已经非常好了，我真的不能再去向她提更多要求，而且如果她拒绝了该多丢人啊。”

“这个险值得一冒，而且即使她亏了这笔钱，她也不会在乎。我相信你一定能说服她，如果你肯尝试一下。”

朱莉娅很清楚自己能说服多莉。迈克尔在某些方面头脑很简单；而她也不愿意告诉他已经明摆着的事实。

然而，一旦迈克尔认定了某件事情就不可能轻易放弃。周六晚上的表演结束后，他们开着朱莉娅在迈克尔生日时送给他的车，准备去吉尔福德与多莉共度周末。这是个美妙而温暖的夜晚。迈克尔已经购买了——虽然写支票的时候心痛不已——三部他们俩都喜欢的剧本，并且他已经打听到一家条件合理的剧院。一切都已准备好了，除了钱。他让朱莉娅这周末抓住机会向多莉提及此事。

“你自己问吧，”朱莉娅不耐烦地说道，“我跟你说，我不会去的。”

“我去问，她不会同意的。你动动小指就能让她跟着你转。”

“现在我们也大概对投资戏剧有了些了解。人们投资戏剧有两种原因，要么他们想要名声，要么他们爱上了某个人。很多人谈论艺术，但很难看到有人会为了艺术真的出钱，除非他们自己会从中得利。”

“那么，我们就给多莉她想要的知名度。”

“那不是她想要的。”

“你什么意思？”

“你猜不出来吗？”

他明白了，惊讶得不得了，以至于连车速都降了下来。朱莉娅怀疑的会是真的吗？他从来没有想过多莉有多么喜欢他，至于多莉爱上了他——这种想法从来没有在他脑子里出现。当然朱莉娅有双犀利的眼睛，几乎什么都逃不过她这双眼，但她是个爱嫉妒的小东西，她总是觉得女人们都力图博得他的宠爱。虽然多莉曾经在圣诞节的时候送过他一副袖扣，但他以为多莉这么做只是避免让他感到被冷落，因为她送给朱莉娅一个至少花了两百镑的胸针。那可能只是多莉的诡计。他可以发誓，他从未做过任何让多莉误解他们之间可能会有什么事情发生的事。朱莉娅笑了。

“不，亲爱的，她爱的并不是你。”

朱莉娅看出他在想什么，这让他觉得不安。你几乎无法向她隐瞒什么。

“那你为什么要让我这么想？我乞求上帝，你能表达得清楚一些吗？这样别人才能明白你的意思。”

朱莉娅这么做了。

“我从未听过这种无稽之谈，”他喊道，“你的思想太肮脏了，朱莉娅！”

“别胡说八道，亲爱的。”

“我不相信你刚刚说的有一句是真话。毕竟我头上也长了眼睛。难道你想说我就从未注意到吗？”这是她认识迈克尔这么久以来，他最暴躁的一次，“即使你说的是真的，我也相信你能照顾好自己。这是个千载难逢的好机会，我觉得如果不抓住的话简直就是愚昧至极。”

“《一报还一报》中的克劳第奥和伊莎贝拉。(1)”

“说什么混账话，朱莉娅。上帝啊，我是个绅士。”

“‘犯我者必受惩。’”

他们在暗藏着暴风雨的沉寂中开车走完了剩下的路途。德·弗里斯太太还在等待他们。

“我不想还没见到你就去上床睡觉了。”她说道，拥抱了朱莉娅并亲吻了她两个脸颊。然后，她和迈克尔轻快地握了握手。

第二天，朱莉娅在床上读着星期日的报纸，度过了一个愉快的早晨。她先读了有关剧院的消息，然后是八卦专栏，之后读了关于女人的部分，最后瞧了一眼世界新闻的头条。书评被直接忽略，她搞不懂为什么这部分要占据那么大的篇幅。住在隔壁的迈克尔进来说了一声早安后就去花园了。现在，她门外有人小心翼翼地敲门，然后多莉走了进来。她那双又大又黑的眼睛闪着光芒。她坐在床上，握住了朱莉娅的手。

“亲爱的，我已经跟迈克尔谈过了，我会出钱让你经营剧院的。”

朱莉娅的心脏突然狂跳不止。

“哦，你千万别这么做。迈克尔本就不该去问你。我不会同意的。你对我们已经非常非常好了。”

多莉俯下身来，亲吻了朱莉娅的嘴唇。她的声音比平常还要低沉，带着点微微的颤音。

“哦，我的宝贝，难道你不知道这世上没什么是我不会为你做的吗？一切都会非常美好；它将让我们的关系更加密切，而且我会为你感到非常骄傲。”

她们听到迈克尔在走廊里吹口哨，当他走进房间时，多莉转身面向他，泪眼蒙眬。

“我刚刚告诉了她。”

他兴奋得眉飞色舞。

“多么伟大的女人啊！”他坐在床的另一边，握着朱莉娅另外那只手，“你说呢，朱莉娅？”

她朝他瞥了一眼，心事满满。

“‘这原是你要这样做的，乔治·当丹。’”(2)

“你说什么？”

“莫里哀。”

在合作协议签署完成、迈克尔办妥了剧院秋天营业的手续之后，他立刻雇用了一个宣传代理人。报纸上刊登了多篇报道宣布这一新投资，迈克尔和这个宣传代理人还为他和朱莉娅准备了媒体采访。他们的照片刊登在各种周刊上，其中有单人照还有合照，有罗杰出镜的以及没有罗杰出镜的。家庭信息中最有价值的都被利用了起来。他们无法决定买下的三部剧中首先上演哪一部。某天下午，当朱莉娅坐在卧室读小说时，迈克尔手里拿着剧本走了进来。

“看这里，我想要你立刻读这个剧本。这是刚刚从一个中介那里得来的。我觉得棒极了。只是我们必须现在就做决定。”

朱莉娅放下小说。

“我现在就读。”

“我在楼下。你读完了告诉我，我会上来跟你讨论。这剧本有一个非常精彩的角色给你。”

朱莉娅读得很快，迅速浏览她不感兴趣的部分，但女主角的部分，也就是她要演的部分，她读得非常仔细。当她翻到最后一页，她拉响铃铛，让女仆（也是她的服装师）告诉迈克尔她在等他。

“你怎么想？”

“这个剧本不错。我看不出为什么会不成功。”

他听出她声调中的怀疑口吻。

“那么有什么问题？角色很精彩。我是说，这正是你最擅长演的角色，你会比世界上任何其他演员演得好。有很多喜剧部分，还有你想要的一切情感。”

“我知道女主角是不错的角色，我说的是男主角。”

“也是个非常好的角色。”

“我知道；但他已经五十岁了，如果你让他变得年轻点，那所有的意义就都消失了。而你肯定不想演一个中年男人。”

“但我没有想着要饰演那个角色。只有一个男人适合这个角色。蒙特·弗农。我们可以请到他。我演乔治。”

“但那是个非常小的角色，你不能演那个。”

“为什么不能？”

“但我以为我们经营剧院的目的就是能一起演主角啊。”

“哦，我一点都不在乎那个。只要我们能找到适合你演主角的剧本就行，我无所谓。也许下个剧本中会有个不错的角色适合我。”

朱莉娅靠到她的椅子上，泪水充满了她的双眼，顺着脸颊流下。

“哦，我真是个禽兽。”

他笑了笑，他的笑容还如同以往一样迷人。他走到她身边，跪了下来，拥抱了她。

“老天爷保佑，这位老太太现在怎么样啦？”

朱莉娅这会儿注视着迈克尔，心里想着，他以前究竟是用什么唤醒了她心中火热的激情。想到曾与他发生过的性关系，这让她感到恶心。幸运的是，他对朱莉娅为他布置的床非常满意。他并不是一个把性生活看得很重的人，因而当他发现朱莉娅不再对他有任何要求，这让他松了口气。他想一定是婴儿的出生让她平静下来，他早就想到可能会这样，现在他觉得没早点儿要小孩是个遗憾。当他有那么两三次，更多地出于友好而非欲望，建议恢复性关系，她借口拒绝了。要么是因为太累，身体不适，要么是第二天有两场演出，更不用说早上还要去试穿服装，他平静地接受了她的理由。朱莉娅比以前好相处了许多，她不再吵闹，而他从未像现在这样开心过。他的婚姻简直太幸福了，当他看到别人的婚姻时，他无法抑制地想自己属于幸运者中的一个。朱莉娅为人善良又聪明，像猴子那样聪明；你能同她讲世界上任何事情。她是一个人所能得到的最理想的伴侣。他甚至不会介意这么说，比起打一轮高尔夫，他宁愿和朱莉娅待上一整天。

朱莉娅惊讶地发现自己对迈克尔有一种怜悯之情，因为她已不再爱他。她是个善良的女人，她明白如果迈克尔知道自己对她毫不重要，这对迈克尔将会是一个痛苦的打击。她继续恭维他。她注意到，很久以来，他听到她称赞他那精致的鼻子和美丽的眼睛时都会扬扬得意。她想看看他能受得了多少赞美，这成了她自己的小消遣。她竭力夸奖他。但现在她更多地注意到他那张单薄没有曲线的嘴巴。随着他渐渐变老，迈克尔的嘴越来越难看，当他真正成了一个老人时，这张嘴将只剩下一条生硬冰冷的直线。他的节俭，早年的时候被认为有趣，是一个令人感动的特点，现在让她感到厌恶。当人们陷入困境时，尤其是舞台上的人们经常会遇到这样的情况，迈克尔会奉上亲切友好的慰问之词，却几乎从不给钱。当他捐了一基尼硬币，他都会觉得自己非常慷慨，捐献五英镑对他来说是极度奢侈的。他很快发现朱莉娅持家挥霍无度，坚持要从她手中接管过这个工作，以免除她的麻烦。在那之后，家里没什么浪费了。每一分钱都花得很值。朱莉娅想不明白为什么仆人们还会待在他们家里。那是因为迈克尔对他们非常和蔼可亲。迈克尔那真诚、欢乐、平易近人的态度让他们急于讨好他，当厨娘发现从某个屠夫那里买肉会一斤省下一分钱的时候，迈克尔和她都喜笑颜开，非常满意。一想到他对节俭的热情和他在舞台上呈现的那些满不在乎、挥霍无度的人物形成的反差，朱莉娅忍不住大笑。她时常以为迈克尔无法有慷慨的冲动；现在，就好像是这世上最自然的事情一样，他已经准备好站到一边，让她去抓住自己的机遇了。她感动得说不出话来。对于长期以来她对他不好的想法，朱莉娅感到强烈的自责。

第九章


他们上演了这部剧，演出非常成功。那之后，他们一年又一年地上演一部部戏剧。由于迈克尔像管理他们的家那样节俭地经营剧院，因此他们虽然有失手的时候，但并没有损失很多钱，戏剧演出成功的时候却挣了每一分能挣的钱。迈克尔很得意，他认为伦敦没有一个剧院经理像他这样能在剧作上花这么少的钱。迈克尔精于改装旧布景，使它们看起来像新的一样，他还给渐渐积攒起来的家具改头换面，省下了租赁的费用。他们赢得了有开创精神的名声，因为不想给那些有名的剧作家高额的费用，迈克尔总是愿意尝试不知名的剧作家的作品。他还寻找那些从未有过演出机会以及薪水很少的演员，也因而发掘了不少有利可图的新演员。

在经营了三年后，他们已经有充足的经济底子，足以让迈克尔从银行贷款买下一个刚刚建成的剧院的地契。在几番讨论后，他们最终决定将之命名为西登斯剧院。开业的第一部剧就很失败，接着上演的另一部也没有好转。朱莉娅害怕起来，有些泄气。她觉得这剧院走了霉运，公众开始厌烦她了。也就是在这段时间里，迈克尔展现了他最可贵的品质。他泰然处之。

“在这一行，你必须好坏都能一起接纳。你是英国最好的女演员。只有三个人，不论剧本好坏，都能叫座，你就是其中一个。我们已经发了两发哑炮。下部剧一定会有起色的，那时，我们不仅会收回之前我们损失的，还能大赚一笔。”

当迈克尔感到自己立稳了脚跟，他立刻试图买回多莉·德·弗里斯的股份，但多莉并不听从他的劝说，对他的冷漠也视而不见。这一次，他的狡猾找到了对手。多莉觉得没有理由卖出看起来还不错的投资，而且对剧院持股让她能与朱莉娅保持亲密联系。但现在，在新剧院经营状况不稳定的时候，迈克尔鼓足勇气试图摆脱她。但多莉义正词严地拒绝在他们遇到困难的时候抛下他们，于是他只能放弃了。他安慰自己，想着多莉可能会留给罗杰，她的教子，一大笔钱。除了在南非的几个侄子，她没有什么亲人，而且她看起来像是患有高血压。同时，他们可以随时去吉尔福德附近的别墅，这也带来不少便利，还节约了他们置办一栋郊区别墅的钱。第三部剧非常成功，迈克尔丝毫没有犹豫地指出他当时有多么正确。他说话的方式好像这部剧的成功全部归功于他。朱莉娅几乎希望这部剧和前两部一样失败，好杀杀他的气焰，因为他那自负的样子实在让人觉得可恶。当然，你必须承认，他有几分聪明，或者是精明，但他绝没有自己想象的那般聪明。他总是觉得在任何事情上都比别人知道得多。

随着时间流逝，迈克尔开始渐渐不再演戏。他发现自己对管理剧院更有兴趣。

“我想像管理市政府机关那样有条不紊地经营剧院。”他说道。

同时，迈克尔觉得在朱莉娅演戏的晚上去一些边远的剧院转转，并试图发掘好演员，可以更加高效地利用他的夜晚时间。他有一个小本子，里面记录了他对每一位看起来有前途的演员的笔记。然后他开始导演戏剧。每想到那些导演要求用那么多钱去排练一出戏剧，他总是抱怨连天。最近，有些导演甚至坚持要获得总收入的一部分作为报酬。最终，朱莉娅最中意的两个导演都没空，另外一个她信任的导演在演戏，因而无法全情投入导演的工作中。

“我非常想亲自试试。”迈克尔说道。

朱莉娅表示怀疑。他缺乏想象力，想法也极为普通。她不确定他是否能驾驭得了整个剧组。但唯一能请来的导演要求的报酬在两人看来高得离谱，除了让迈克尔一试之外也没有别的办法了。但迈克尔的表现超出了朱莉娅的预期。他细致缜密，工作很努力。让朱莉娅感到非常奇怪的是，迈克尔比以往任何导演都更能激发她的潜能。他知道她的能力极限，对她音调的每一处变化、美妙双眸的每一次注视以及她身体的每一个优雅的动作都非常熟悉，他给她的建议，让她成功地展现出她职业生涯迄今为止最好的表演。迈克尔与整个剧组的相处模式既宽容，又严格。当大家的脾气到达爆发边缘时，他那副好个性，再加上他真诚的友善，能让事情平息下来。在那之后，毫无疑问他应该继续导演他们自己的戏剧。剧作家们也都喜欢迈克尔，由于他缺乏想象，他只能按照剧本所写的来导戏，而且他时常不能确定剧本所描述的意思，只能去请教他们。

朱莉娅现在是个有钱女人了。她不得不承认，对于她的钱迈克尔如同对自己的钱那样爱护。他小心地关注着她的投资，当迈克尔把她户头的股票以高利润的价格卖出去时，高兴得如同自己挣了钱一般。他给她很大一笔薪水，并且非常骄傲地宣称她是伦敦最贵的女演员，但当他自己演出的时候，他给自己的薪水从来不会高出角色应得的报酬。当他导演戏剧的时候，他给自己二流导演的费用。他们共同承担房子的花销以及罗杰教育的开支。罗杰出生不到一周，他们便给他在伊顿公学报了名。不可否认，迈克尔在公平和诚实方面做得一丝不苟。当朱莉娅意识到她比迈克尔富有得多时，她想自己承担所有的费用。

“你没有任何理由这么做，”迈克尔说道，“只要我还付得起，我就会支付。你比我挣得多因为你值得那么多。我给你付高薪水因为那是你应得的。”

没人不敬佩他为了她而牺牲自我的克己精神。他放弃了自己的一切抱负，为了成就她的职业。甚至不喜欢迈克尔的多莉也承认他的无私奉献。每当朱莉娅想和多莉讨论迈克尔，总是被一种羞怯阻止，但精明的多莉很早就发现迈克尔让朱莉娅恼怒，于是多莉时不时地向她指出他对她的帮助有多大。所有人都赞美他。一个完美的丈夫。在她看来，除了她没人知道和他这样一个虚荣的怪物住在一起是什么感觉。当他在高尔夫球场上打败对手或者在生意场上占了某人的上风时显示出的扬扬自得的神情令人火冒三丈。他美化他的狡猾。他令人生厌，彻头彻尾地让人厌恶。他喜欢告诉朱莉娅他做的一切，以及他脑海中出现的一切诡计；起初仅仅是拥有他就让她开怀的时光多么美好，但这么多年来她渐渐无法忍受他的装腔作势。无论描述什么，他都要把大大小小的细节讲出来。他不仅仅对自己的商业头脑感到得意；随着年事增长，他竟无耻地为自己的英俊潇洒而感到自豪。年轻时，他对自己的美貌不以为然；现在却开始花更多心思在上面，并且不遗余力地保持他残留的风采。他对自己外表的关注几乎成了一种执念，对自己的体形也花了不少心思。他从不会吃让他长胖的食物，从不会忘记运动。他发现自己的头发稀疏起来，便向美发专家咨询。如果能让他的脸年轻起来，朱莉娅确信他会暗地里做手术。他已经养成某种坐姿，使他的脖子稍稍前突，这样他脖子上的皱纹就不会显现出来，并且他会弓起背，防止肚子下垂。如果他经过一面镜子，他必定会照一照。他渴望被恭维，能得到一句赞美便眉开眼笑。奉承话是他的食物和水。朱莉娅想起来是她让他养成了这个习惯，不禁苦笑起来。有许多年，她总是告诉迈克尔他有多美，现在他竟然离不开这些恭维了。这是他唯一的弱点。一个没工作的女演员只需当面告诉迈克尔他太帅了，他就会在脑子里想想是否有她能演的角色。这么多年来，朱莉娅知道，迈克尔并不在乎女人，不过等他到了四十五岁左右，竟然开始和女人打情骂俏。朱莉娅并不觉得这些调情会有什么实际结果。他只是希望得到她们的崇拜。据她所知，当那些女人追得过紧，他就会用她来做挡箭牌甩掉她们。要么是他不能冒险做任何伤害她的事情，要么是她嫉妒心强或者多疑，因此这段友谊最好到此为止。

“上帝知道她们看上了他什么。”朱莉娅对着空房子感叹道。

她随意拿了半打他最近的照片，一张一张仔细观察。她耸耸肩。

“好吧，我想我也不能责怪她们，我也曾爱上他。当然那时他更好看些。”

想起她曾经多么爱他，让朱莉娅有点伤感。因为她的爱消失了，她感到自己被生活欺骗了。朱莉娅叹了口气。

“我的背开始痛了。”她说道。





第十章


有人在敲门。

“请进。”朱莉娅说道。

是伊维进来了。

“您今天还不去休息吗，兰伯特小姐？”她看到朱莉娅坐在地板上，周围都是照片，“您在做什么？”

“做梦。”她捡起两张照片，“看这张照片，还有这张。”

一张是迈克尔最年轻帅气时饰演茂丘西奥时的照片，另一张是迈克尔演最后一个角色时的照片，他戴着白色的礼帽，穿着晨礼服，肩膀上挂着一副双筒望远镜。他看起来自鸣得意得不可救药。

伊维嗤之以鼻。

“哦，没必要冲着洒了的牛奶哭。”

“我一直在回忆过去，现在快忧郁死了。”

“一定的。当你开始回想过去，那就意味着你没有什么未来了，是吗？”

“快闭嘴吧，你这老母牛。”朱莉娅说道。如果她愿意，她可以非常粗俗。

“快点吧，否则会影响今晚的演出，我来把乱糟糟的屋子收拾一下。”

伊维是朱莉娅的服装师兼女仆。在米德尔普尔时，她就为朱莉娅服务，后来随她来了伦敦。她是伦敦本地人，看起来身子单薄，无精打采，瘦骨嶙峋。她有些上了年纪，一头红发总是不整齐，似乎需要大洗一番；她的两颗门牙没了，尽管朱莉娅多年来一直提出要为她补上，但她却不愿意。

“对于我的食量而言，我这几颗牙完全足够了。嘴巴里装那么多象牙才让我紧张呢。”

迈克尔很早就希望朱莉娅能至少再请一位外表更能适合这个职位的女仆，他曾试图说服伊维承认这些工作对她来说太多了，但伊维没有听。

“您怎么说都行，格斯林先生，但只要我还健康有力气，就不会再有其他人来伺候兰伯特小姐。”

“我们都老了，你知道吧，伊维。我们都不再年轻了。”

伊维用食指抹了一把鼻孔，吸了吸鼻涕。

“只要兰伯特小姐还可以饰演二十五岁的年轻女人，我就可以为她换衣服，做她的女仆。”伊维狠狠地看了他一眼，“而且既然这点活您出一倍的钱就能完成，为什么还要出两倍的价钱？”

迈克尔没脾气地笑了笑。

“我没有别的意思，亲爱的伊维。”

伊维催赶着朱莉娅上了楼。当朱莉娅没有午场演出的时候，她会在下午上床休息几个小时，然后做个轻轻的按摩。她脱了衣服，钻进了被窝。

“可恶，我的热水袋快冻成冰了。”

她看了看壁炉架上的钟表。难怪，热水袋被放在这里至少有一个小时了。她不知道自己在迈克尔的房间里待了那么久，翻阅那些照片，无所事事地回忆过去。

“四十六。四十六。四十六。当我六十岁的时候我就会退休。五十八岁的时候去南非和澳大利亚。迈克尔说我们会在那里大捞一笔。两万英镑。我可以出演所有以往的角色。当然，即便到了六十，我也能演四十五岁的女人。但有什么四十五岁的好角色呢？这些可恨的戏剧家。”

朱莉娅脑子里想着有没有一部一流戏剧的女主角是四十五岁，渐渐地睡着了。她睡得很沉，直到伊维叫醒了她，因为按摩师到了。伊维给她拿来了晚报，朱莉娅脱光衣服，按摩师按摩着她那细长的腿，她的肚子。朱莉娅戴上眼镜，又读了一遍她早上已经读过的戏剧消息、八卦专栏还有女性专题。此刻，迈克尔走了进来，坐在她床上。他经常会在这个时候来找她，和她聊上一阵子。

“他叫什么名字来着？”朱莉娅问道。

“谁的名字？”

“那个来吃午饭的男孩。”

“我不知道。我开车送他回了剧院。我没再想过他一下。”

这位按摩师，菲利普斯小姐，喜欢迈克尔。跟迈克尔在一起会很自在。他总是说一样的话，你知道如何应答。他也没什么架子，而且长得极其帅气。真的！

“菲利普斯小姐，她减肥效果不错吧？”

“哦，格斯林先生，兰伯特小姐没有一点赘肉。我觉得她身材保持得太好了！”

“真可惜我无法让你为我按摩，菲利普斯小姐。或许你能对我保持身材有所帮助。”

“您怎么说话呢，格斯林先生。您有二十岁男孩的身材。我不知道您是怎么做到的，我发誓我不知道。”

“简单生活，多动脑子，菲利普斯小姐。”

朱莉娅并没有在意他们在聊什么，但菲利普斯小姐的回答钻进了她耳朵。

“按摩当然非常管用，我一直这样认为，但您必须要注意自己的饮食，毫无疑问。”

“饮食！”她想，“当我六十岁的时候，我打算放任自己。我要吃所有我喜欢的黄油面包。早饭我要热面包卷，午饭和晚饭我都要吃土豆。还有啤酒，上帝，我多喜欢啤酒啊。豌豆汤和西红柿汤；糖浆布丁和樱桃馅饼。奶油，奶油，奶油。上帝啊，帮帮我，只要我还活着我就再也不想吃菠菜了。”

按摩后，伊维给她递来一杯茶，一片削掉肥肉的火腿，还有几片干吐司。朱莉娅起身，穿好衣服，和迈克尔一起去了剧院。她喜欢在幕布拉开前一个小时到达剧院。迈克尔会去他的俱乐部吃晚餐。伊维会坐出租车先行前往剧院，当朱莉娅到达她的更衣间时，一切都已经安排妥当。她再一次脱下衣服，穿上戏服。当她坐在她的梳妆台前开始化妆时，她注意到花瓶里插着一些鲜花。

“喂，谁送来的？是德·弗里斯夫人吗？”

多莉在她首场演出时送了她一个巨大的花篮，在她演出第一百晚和还有第二百晚（如果真的有这么一天），还有在此之间，只要她为自己的房子预订鲜花时，总会送一些给朱莉娅。

“不是，小姐。”

“查尔斯公爵？”

查尔斯·泰默利公爵是朱莉娅最早的也是最忠诚的爱慕者，当他路过花店时，他总会为朱莉娅订一些玫瑰。

“这是名片。”伊维说道。

朱莉娅看了一眼。托马斯·芬纳尔先生。塔维斯托克广场。

“住的什么鬼地方。你觉得这到底会是谁，伊维？”

“我觉得是某个被您的美貌迷倒的家伙。”

“这花肯定花了一英镑。塔维斯托克广场在我印象里并不是什么有钱人住的地方。你知道吧，买了这花，他可能一周都没钱吃饭了。”

“我想不至于吧。”

朱莉娅往脸上涂上油彩。

“该死，你太不浪漫了，伊维。就因为我不是个歌舞女郎，你就无法理解为什么会有人送我鲜花。上帝知道，我的双腿比她们都漂亮。”

“您和您的双腿都漂亮。”伊维说道。

“我不妨告诉你，我觉得在我这个年纪，有不知名的年轻男人送我鲜花没有什么不正常。我是说正好给你看看。”

“虽然我对男人也没什么了解，但如果他们看到您现在的样子，肯定不会送了。”

“去死吧。”朱莉娅说道。

当朱莉娅化好妆，伊维为她穿好长筒袜和鞋后，还有几分钟空闲，她坐在自己的桌子前，用她潦草粗放的字迹，写了一封热情洋溢的信给托马斯·芬纳尔先生，感谢他送来的鲜花。她天生就很有礼貌，而且回复所有仰慕者来信是她的一贯原则。这是她和公众保持联系的方式。写好信封后，她将卡片扔进废纸桶，准备穿上第一幕戏的戏服。催场员叩响了化妆间的门。

“开场演员请出场。”

这些话，虽然她已不知听了多少遍，却仍旧会让她内心颤动。它们像给她服了一剂补药。生活获得了意义。她即将从虚构世界步入真实世界。





第十一章


第二天，朱莉娅和查尔斯·泰默利共进午餐。他的父亲，丹诺伦特侯爵娶了一位女继承人，因此他父亲得到了一笔可观的财产。他喜欢在他位于希尔街的别墅中举办午餐派对，朱莉娅经常过去。其实在她内心深处，她对在那里遇见的那些达官显贵和阔太太都持有深深的蔑视，因为她是一个职业女性，一位艺术家，但她也知道这些关系会有用处。多亏这些关系，他们在西登斯剧院的首演才被报纸描述得非常精彩，她知道，在周末宴会上和一群显贵拍照会有很好的曝光效果。有一两位比她年轻的女主角不怎么喜欢她，因为她对至少两位公爵夫人直呼其名。但她并没有后悔这么做。朱莉娅不是一个非常健谈的人，但她眼睛明亮，举止优雅，一旦学会了上流社会的语言，她称得上一个令人愉悦的女人。她有模仿的天赋，但不怎么表现出来，怕影响到自己的表演，但在这些社交圈里，她极好地利用了自己这点长处，并因此获得了机智的名声。她很高兴她们都喜欢她，这些聪明悠闲的女人，但她一直暗地嘲笑她们竟然会为她的光彩倾倒。她在想，如果她们知道一个成功女演员的生活是多么不浪漫，以及她付出的所有辛苦，对自己仪表所倾注的爱护，还有不得不保持那些乏味而必需的习惯时，会有什么想法。但她友好地向她们提供化妆方面的建议，让她们仿制自己的衣服。她总是穿得很漂亮。即使迈克尔也乐意接受，只当她穿的衣服都不用自己花钱，并不知道她实际上花费了多少。

她的德行在这两个世界里都无懈可击。人人都知道她和迈克尔是模范夫妻。她是忠诚妻子的典范。同时，在这个特定的圈子里，人们都认为她是查尔斯·泰默利的情人。这段私情由于时间太久而得到了人们的认可和尊重，当二人同时被邀请去做客时，宽容的主妇们会把他们俩安排在相邻的房间里休息。这一猜测始于查尔斯夫人，她早已与查尔斯·泰默利分开，但事实上，这谣言毫无可信之处。唯一的证据是查尔斯爱慕朱莉娅二十年之久，同样也是因为朱莉娅，从未好好相处的泰默利夫妻，同意离婚。事实上，是查尔斯夫人介绍朱莉娅与查尔斯认识的。他们三人恰好在多莉家吃午餐，那时，朱莉娅作为一个年轻演员刚在伦敦取得第一次重大成功。那是个盛大的宴会，她很受尊重。查尔斯夫人，三十出头，是个公认的漂亮女人，虽然除了眼睛之外她的容貌并不值得称赞。但她凭着大胆、脸皮厚，成功摆出一副令人印象深刻的模样，她靠着桌子俯身向前，露出优雅的微笑。

“哦，兰伯特小姐，我想我在泽西的时候曾经认识你的父亲。他是位医生，对吧？他经常到我家里来。”

朱莉娅腹中涌起一阵恶心；她想起结婚前的查尔斯夫人是谁了，并意识到她设下的陷阱。朱莉娅发出一阵笑声。

“根本不是，”她回答道，“他是个兽医。他以前经常去您家里给那些母狗接生。那房子里全都是母狗。”

听到这样的回答，查尔斯夫人竟一时语塞。

“我母亲非常喜欢狗。”她回答道。

朱莉娅庆幸迈克尔不在那儿。可怜的家伙，如果他听到这话，定会觉得受到了莫大的屈辱。他总是称呼朱莉娅的父亲为兰伯特医生，念得好像这是个法国名字。他（朱莉娅的父亲）在大战结束不久后就去世了，于是她的母亲便搬去同她在圣马洛的遗孀妹妹一起居住，此后迈克尔开始称呼她为兰伯特夫人。在她的职业生涯之初，朱莉娅曾对此有些敏感，但当她成名后，她改变了想法。她倾向于——尤其是在显贵人物中间——强调她父亲是兽医这个事实。她无法解释个中原因，但她觉得这样做可以让大家都安分一些。

但查尔斯·泰默利明白，他的妻子是故意要侮辱这位年轻女人，他心中泛起怒火，于是故意向朱莉娅示好。他问起能否登门拜访，为她送上一些美丽的鲜花。

那时他年近四十，优雅的身躯上长了一个小小的脑袋，长相虽不好看但很高贵。他看起来很有教养，事实也如此，他的举止非常高雅。他是个艺术爱好者。他购买现代绘画，收藏古董家具。他热爱音乐，博览群书。起初，拜访这两个年轻演员在白金汉宫路上的小公寓让他觉得很有趣。他看得出他们很穷，与这对儿被他视为真正的波西米亚夫妻有联系让他很兴奋。他来过几次，他们请他在家里吃午饭，一个衣衫褴褛的名叫伊维的妇女服侍他们，这让他觉得与众不同。这才是生活。他并没有对迈克尔太在意，对他而言，迈克尔虽然长相出众，却只是一个资质平庸的年轻人，但他被朱莉娅迷住了。她性格温和，有魄力，活力四射，这都是他不曾见识过的。他去观看了几次她的表演，并把她的表演同他所认识的著名外国女演员们做了一番比较。在他看来，朱莉娅有非常独特的品质。她的魅力不容置疑。当他突然意识到她拥有天赋时，不禁有些激动。

“或许是另一个西登斯。一个更加伟大的爱伦·泰瑞(1)。”

那时候，朱莉娅并没有下午休息的习惯，她体壮如牛，从不觉得疲惫，因此他经常同她在公园散步。她感到他希望她有孩子般的天性。这非常适合她。表现得天真、坦诚、如同少女一样对一切事物感到高兴对她来说毫不费力。他带她去国家美术馆、泰特美术馆和大英博物馆，她如她说的那样享受。他喜欢给别人灌输，而她也很乐意接受。她记性很好，从他那儿学到了不少东西。后来她可以和最优秀的人士谈论普鲁斯特和塞尚，以至于会让人家对一个女演员能够有如此高的文化修养感到惊叹，这些都归功于他。她甚至在他自己意识到之前就明白他已经爱上了她。她觉得很可笑。在她看来，他是个中年男人，她把他看作一位友善的老家伙。那时她疯狂地爱着迈克尔。当查尔斯意识到自己爱上朱莉娅时，他的举止有了一些变化，他看起来非常腼腆，当他俩在一起时，他经常沉默不语。

“可怜的家伙，”她心里想，“他真是太绅士了，竟不知道对此要怎么办。”

但她已经准备好如何应对在她看来他迟早都会进行的表白。有一件事情她要让他明白。她决意不让他认为自己是爵爷，而她仅是个女演员，只要他随意召唤一声，她便会急不可耐地跳上他的床。如果他尝试那么做，她会对他扮演发怒的女主角，用珍妮·塔特布教给她的手势，猛然地伸出胳膊，食指顺势指向房门。另一方面，如果他心烦意乱，结结巴巴，她自己也得浑身发颤，带着哭腔诉说她从没思考过他对她的感情，哦，不，这一定会伤透了迈克尔的心。他们会抱在一起大哭一场，然后一切会恢复正常。以他那温文尔雅的性格，一旦他明白一切都不可能的时候，她相信他不会做出令人讨厌的事情。

但当事情发生时完全出乎她的意料。查尔斯·泰默利和朱莉娅一起在圣詹姆斯公园散步，他们看了鹈鹕，被景色启发，讨论了朱莉娅在某个周日夜晚出演米拉曼(2)的可能性。他们返回朱莉娅的公寓喝茶，吃了一块松脆饼。之后，查尔斯起身准备离去。他从口袋里掏出一幅微型画像，递给她。

“这是克莱朗(3)的画像。她是十八世纪的女演员，她有很多你的天赋。”

朱莉娅看着这张美丽聪明的脸庞，头发上涂着粉黛，心想相框上镶着的是钻石还是人造宝石。

“哦，查尔斯，你怎么会送我这样的礼物！你太可爱了。”

“我觉得你可能会喜欢它。就当是分别的礼物吧。”

“你要离开吗？”

她很惊讶，因为他未曾提起过此事。他看着她，面带浅浅的微笑。

“不。但我不打算再见你了。”

“为什么？”

“你心里和我一样明白。”

然后，朱莉娅做了一件有失体面的事情。她坐了下来，静静地看着这幅画像。她算计着时间，慢慢抬起双眼，直到与查尔斯的眼睛相遇。她几乎可以做到想哭就哭，这是她最厉害的成就之一，而现在，不发一点声响，没有一丝啜泣，眼泪顺着她的脸颊流了下来。她的嘴微微张开，眼神像受到伤害却不知由头的孩子，这样子简直可怜到让人无法忍受。他的脸上交织着痛苦。当他开口说话时，声音嘶哑，充满感情。

“你爱着迈克尔，对吧？”

她点了点头。她抿紧了嘴巴，似乎要努力控制自己，但眼泪还是不停地流下来。

“我一点机会都没有？”他在等她的答案，但她并没有回答，而是把手抬到嘴边，似乎在咬指甲，直到她用她那双迷蒙的泪眼盯着他。“难道你不知道继续见你会给我带来痛苦吗？你希望我继续见你吗？”

再一次，她微微点了点头。

“克拉拉总是因为你跟我过不去。她已经发现我爱上了你。正常来说，我们不应该再见面了。”

这次，朱莉娅稍稍摇了摇头。她抽泣了一下。她靠到椅子上，把头扭向了一边。她的整个身体都在表示她痛苦的绝望。血肉之躯都无法承受。查尔斯走向前，跪了下来，把那具伤心欲绝的身体拥入怀中。

“看在上帝的分上，请不要看起来这样难过。我无法忍受。哦，朱莉娅，朱莉娅，我如此爱你，我不能让你受这样的折磨。我会无条件接受一切，对你没有任何要求。”

她将她泪痕斑斑的脸转向他（“上帝，我现在该多么动人啊”），奉上双唇。他温柔地吻了她。那是他头一次吻她。

“我不想失去你。”她嘶哑地喃喃道。

“亲爱的，亲爱的！”

“一切就和以前一样？”

“就如同以前一样。”

她如释重负地叹了口气，在他怀中待了一两分钟。当他离开后，她站了起来，照了照镜子。

“你这个坏婊子。”她对自己说。

但她咯咯笑着，没有一点羞愧，然后她走进浴室清洗脸和眼睛。她感到非常兴奋。她听到迈克尔走了进来，便大声向他喊道。

“迈克尔，你看查尔斯刚刚给我的那幅画像，在壁炉架上。上面那些是钻石还是人造宝石？”

当查尔斯太太离开她丈夫的时候，朱莉娅有些紧张。查尔斯太太威胁说要起诉离婚，朱莉娅一点都不喜欢作为婚姻介入者出庭这件事。有那么一两周她都紧张兮兮的。她决定除非迫不得已，不会向迈克尔透露一句。她庆幸自己没有这么做，事实证明，查尔斯太太的这些威胁仅仅是为了从无辜的丈夫那里得到更多的赡养费。朱莉娅以精湛的演技应付查尔斯。双方都明白，她对迈克尔的爱使得他们无法有任何亲密的关系，但除此以外，他是她的一切，她的朋友，她的顾问，她的密友，她在一切紧急情况下有求必应的靠山，失意时可从他那儿寻求安慰。当细心敏感的查尔斯发现朱莉娅已经不再爱着迈克尔时，这成了一个棘手的问题。朱莉娅不得不使尽手段。并不是因为她忌惮成为他的情人；如果他是个演员，而且又爱了她这么久，她并不介意出于好意跳上他的床；但她就是对他提不起兴趣。她很喜欢他，但他那么优雅、有涵养、有文化，她无法将他看成自己的爱人。跟他上床就好像跟一件艺术品上床一样。而他对艺术的热爱让她心中对他有些嘲笑；毕竟她才是艺术的创造者，说到底他不过就是个观众。他希望她能与他一同私奔。他们可以在那不勒斯海湾的索伦托买一座有大花园的别墅，他们还会有一艘帆船，这样他们就能在那美丽的暗紫色的大海上优游岁月。爱情、美丽和艺术；世界消逝。

“这个可恶的笨蛋，”她想，“我怎么可能放弃我的事业，把我自己埋在意大利的某个洞里！”

她让他知道，她对迈克尔还有责任，他们还有个孩子；她无法让他从年纪轻轻开始就背上母亲是个坏女人的负担长大。不管有没有橘子树，一想到迈克尔的不幸福和她的孩子由陌生人照顾，她都无法在意大利那幢漂亮的别墅中有片刻安宁。一个人不能只顾自己，是不是？也要想想其他人。她是一个十分善良、很女人的人。有的时候，她会问查尔斯，为什么不离婚，然后再娶一个不错的女人。她无法忍受他将人生都浪费在她的身上。他告诉她，她是他唯一爱过的女人，他必须一直爱下去，直到最后。

“听着让人伤心。”朱莉娅说道。

尽管如此，朱莉娅还是把眼睛睁得大大的，如果她注意到任何女人对查尔斯有非分之想，她都会去刻意破坏。如果确有其事，她会毫不犹豫地显示她极度的嫉妒。朱莉娅和查尔斯很早就同意，凭借他良好涵养和她的好心，这安排极其周全，不是用具体的语言，而是在谨慎迂回的暗示明喻中达成，如果迈克尔有个三长两短，他们应该把查尔斯夫人解决掉，然后他俩就去结婚。但迈克尔非常健康。

这段时间，朱莉娅非常喜欢在希尔街吃午餐。聚会非常盛大。朱莉娅从不鼓励查尔斯去宴请他偶尔遇到的男演员或者剧作家，因此，她是那聚会上唯一一个需要挣钱养活自己的人。她旁边是一位能说会道的内阁大臣，又老又胖还谢了顶，极尽所能地取悦她；另一边是一位年轻的韦斯特雷斯公爵，看上去像个马倌，并且不停地吹嘘自己比一个法国人知道的法语俚语还要多。当他发现朱莉娅能说法语，他坚持要用法语和朱莉娅交流。午餐后，她被鼓动照着在法兰西喜剧院的方式朗诵《费德尔》中一篇陈词激烈的演讲，然后像一个英国学生在皇家戏剧艺术学院那样朗诵。她总是让客人们捧腹大笑，离开宴会时她沉浸在成功的狂喜中。那是天气明朗的一天，她决定从希尔街走到斯坦霍普广场。当她穿梭在牛津街熙攘的人群中时，很多人都认出了她，虽然她一直目视前方，但她感觉到了他们的注视。

“去哪里都得被人们盯着看真是太麻烦了。”

她放缓了脚步。天气真是好极了。

她用钥匙打开自己的家门，当她走进去时，听到电话铃响起。想都没想她便接起电话。

“谁？”

通常她接电话时会伪装起她的声音，但这次却忘记了。

“兰伯特小姐？”

“我不知道兰伯特小姐是否在家。请问这是谁？”她快速地用伦敦东区口音问道。

但刚刚那个单音节词已经背叛了她。电话中传来一阵笑声。

“我仅是想谢谢您写信给我。您明白的，根本无须如此麻烦。感谢您邀请我吃午餐，我想送您一些鲜花。”

他的声音和话语已经告诉了她这是谁。就是那个她不知道名字的容易脸红的年轻人。直到现在，虽然她已经看过他写的卡片，但她仍旧不记得他的名字。唯一让她留意的地方是他住在塔维斯托克广场。

“你太客气了。”她用自己的声音回答道。

“我想您应该不会某天跟我一起喝茶吧，是吗？”

绝对不会！她甚至不愿意跟公爵夫人一起喝茶；他把她当成了一个歌舞女郎。他有这样的想法简直让人觉得可笑。

“我不明白为什么不会。”

“您真的会？”他的口气听起来很迫切。他的声音很好听。“什么时候？”

那天下午她一点都不想去休息。

“今天。”

“好，我会从办公室溜出来。四点半？塔维斯托克广场138号。”

他这建议很周到。他本可轻易地提一个时髦的地方，在这种地方人们都会盯着她看。这证明他并不是仅仅为了得到媒体曝光才和她一起喝茶。

她打了一辆出租车到塔维斯托克广场。她扬扬自得。她在做一件好事。他能在多年之后跟他的妻子、孩子说，当他还是一个会计事务所里不起眼的小职员时曾和朱莉娅·兰伯特一起喝茶，这对他来说会多么精彩。而且，她是如此简单又如此自然。听过她闲聊的人，没有一个会猜出她是英格兰最伟大的女演员。如果他们不相信他的话，他会用她的照片证明，上面签着“你真诚的”。他会大笑，同时说道，如果他不是那么年轻无知，也不会厚着脸皮去邀请她。

当朱莉娅到达那房子，付过出租车费后，她突然想起，她还不知道他的名字，如果女仆来开门，她不知道该说找谁。在找门铃的时候，她注意到有八个门铃，分成四行，每行两个，每个门铃旁有一张卡片或是一张纸，上面用墨水写着名字。这是间老房子，被分割成了公寓。她非常绝望地开始看那些名字，想着有没有一个名字会让她记起点什么，当门被打开后，他站在她面前。

“我看到您的车到了，于是我跑了下来。很抱歉我住在三楼。希望您别介意。”

“当然不会。”

她爬上没有铺地毯的楼梯。当她到达第三层时，有点喘不上气来。他一跃而上，急切得像只年轻的山羊，朱莉娅心里想着，但她不愿暗示她情愿更悠闲一些。他带她进入的房间相当大，但几乎没有装饰。桌上放着一盘蛋糕和两个杯子，一个糖罐和牛奶罐。陶器是最便宜的那种。

“请坐，”他说道，“水正烧着呢。我很快就好。我的煤气灶在浴室里。”他离开后，她向四周看去。

“可怜的家伙，他一定跟一只教堂的老鼠一样穷。”

这房间让她想起她初登舞台时住过的那些地方。她注意到，他可怜地想要掩饰这间屋子既是卧室也是客厅的事实。墙边摆着的长沙发肯定就是他夜里睡的床。过去的时光在她的想象中隐退，非常奇怪，她觉得自己又变得年轻了。在像这样的房间中他们曾有多少欢乐，曾享受过难以置信的食物，有放在纸袋子里的熟食，还有在煤气灶上煎熟的鸡蛋和培根。他手里端着棕色茶壶泡的茶走了进来。她吃了一块有粉色糖霜的方形松糕。这种东西她有好几年都没吃过了。锡兰红茶，很浓，加了牛奶和糖，让她回到那些她以为已经忘记的时光。她看见自己还是一个年轻的、默默无闻的、努力奋斗的女演员。松糕味道很好。这时需要有个手势来配合，但她只想到一个：她摘下了自己的帽子，把头一甩。

他们聊天。他看起来很害羞，比起电话里的他害羞得多；这也没什么奇怪的，现在她就在他面前，他肯定非常不知所措，她努力让他放轻松。他告诉她，他的父母住在海格特，他的父亲是位律师，他也曾在那里住，但他想要成为自己的主人，终于在他的雇用契约的最后一年他得以逃离家庭，租了这间小公寓。他正在为他的结业考试做准备。他们还聊了剧院。自他十二岁起，她出演的每部戏他都看过。他告诉她，有一次，他十四岁时，在午场演出结束后，他站在剧场后门口，当她出来时他请她在签名簿上签名。他长着一双蓝眼睛和一头浅棕色的头发，非常可爱。可惜他把头发梳得平平的。他皮肤白皙，脸红得厉害；她在想他是不是患有肺病。虽然他的衣服很便宜，但非常得体，她喜欢他这样，他看上去非常干净。

她问他为什么选择在塔维斯托克广场居住。塔维斯托克广场在中心位置，他解释道，而且，他喜欢这些树。从窗户望出去的景色很美。她站起来看，这是采取行动的好方法，然后她就可以戴上帽子，跟他道别。

“是，很不错，不是吗？很伦敦；让人有一种愉快的感觉。”

在她说这些话时，她转向站在身边的他。他用一只胳膊搂住了她的腰，扎实地吻了她。她一生中还未有哪个女角色比现在的她更加惊愕。她愕然不知所措，竟不知要做什么。他的嘴唇很柔软，他身上有种年轻的香味，让人欢欣。但他的所作所为简直荒唐可笑。他用舌尖强行撬开她的嘴唇，现在，他用两只胳膊抱住了她。她并没有感到生气，她也不想笑，她不知道自己是什么感受。而现在，她知道，他正温柔地牵着她走，他的嘴唇仍旧紧贴着她的，她清清楚楚地感受到他身体的灼热，就好像他体内有个小火炉，简直不同凡响；既而，她发现她躺在了那张沙发床上，而他就躺在她身边，亲吻她的嘴唇、她的脖子、她的脸颊和她的眼睛。朱莉娅内心感到一阵莫名的剧痛。她用双手捧着他的脸，吻了他的唇。

几分钟后，她站在壁炉架旁的梳妆镜前，修饰一下自己。

“瞧我的头发。”

他递给她一把梳子，她梳了一下。然后她戴上了帽子。他就站在她身后，她看到自己肩后那张有着热切的蓝色眼睛的脸，带着一丝淡淡的微笑。

“我还以为你是个特别害羞的人。”她对着他在镜子里的影子说道。

他咯咯地笑了。

“我什么时候再见你？”

“你还想再见我？”

“非常。”

她快速地想了想。这太荒谬了，她当然没有再见他的任何意愿，允许他刚才的行为简直愚蠢至极，但应付一下也好，如果她告诉他这事儿没有下一次了他可能会纠缠不休。

“我会给你打电话的。”

“你发誓。”

“以我的名誉做担保。”

“别让我等太久。”

他坚持同她一起下楼，等她上了一辆出租车。她原本想自己下楼，这样就能看一眼门楣上的门铃旁贴着的名片。

“可恶，我至少应该知道他的名字。”

但他没有给她任何机会。当出租车驶离后，朱莉娅蜷缩在车的角落里，咯咯地笑起来。

“被强奸了，天。事实就是被强奸了。在我这个年纪。而且都没有一句恳请原谅的话。把我当成了轻佻女人。十八世纪的喜剧，简直就是这个样。我应该是个女仆，穿着裙撑，还有那些可笑的蓬松的东西——它们叫什么来着？——就是用来放大臀部的那玩意儿，再加上围裙以及脖子里的围巾。”之后，她模糊地想起了法科(4)和哥德史密斯(5)，便杜撰了这样一段台词。“阁下，占一个可怜的乡村女孩的便宜可不光彩。若是夫人阁下的侍女阿比盖尔太太知道夫人的弟弟夺走了我作为这样地位的年轻女孩最宝贵的珍品（我的贞洁），她对此会说什么呢？真丢人，哦，丢人啊，阁下。”

当朱莉娅到家时，按摩师已经在等她了。菲利普斯小姐和伊维正在聊天。

“您去哪里了，兰伯特小姐？”伊维说道，“我想知道您休息得如何。”

“该死的休息。”

朱莉娅脱下衣服，夸张地将它们扔了一地。然后，她全裸着身体，跳到床上，在上面站了片刻，像从海浪中升起的维纳斯，接着将自己抛到床上，四肢伸展开来。

“这是什么意思？”伊维问道。

“我感觉很好。”

“如果我这么做，人们指定说我喝醉了。”

菲利普斯小姐开始按摩她的脚，揉捏得很温柔，让她休息而不是让她疲惫。

“您刚才进屋的时候，就像一阵旋风，”她说道，“我觉得您看起来像年轻了二十岁。您的眼睛光芒四射。”

“哦，把这话留给格斯林先生吧，菲利普斯小姐。”接着她又补充道，“我觉得我像两岁的娃娃。”

后来在剧院也是如此。阿尔奇·德克斯特，她的男主角，走进她的更衣室同她说一些事情。她刚刚化完妆。他被惊住了。

“喂，朱莉娅，今晚你怎么了？天，你看起来棒极了。为什么？你看起来不超过二十五岁。”

“我有一个十六岁的儿子，假装我有多么年轻一点作用都没有。我四十啦，而且我也不介意别人知道。”

“你对你的眼睛做了什么？我从来没有见过它们如此耀眼。”

她感到状态极佳。这部名叫《粉扑》的戏他们已经演了好几周了，但今晚朱莉娅像是第一次表演这部戏一样。她的演出非常精彩，收获了从未有过的笑声。她一直都极具吸引力，但今晚她的吸引力似乎更加光芒四射地弥漫在整个剧场里。迈克尔恰巧在包厢的一个角落里观看了最后两场戏，演出结束后他走进她的更衣室。

“你知道提词员说今晚我们的演出延长了九分钟吗？观众笑得太多了。”

“七次谢幕。我差点儿以为观众会闹个通宵。”

“那样的话，你只能怪你自己了，亲爱的。这世界上没有别的演员能有你今晚这般的表现。”

“跟你说实话，我也很享受。上帝啊，我饿了。晚餐我们吃什么？”

“洋葱牛肚。”

“哦，太好了！”她伸出胳膊抱住了他的脖子，亲吻了他，“我喜欢洋葱牛肚。哦，迈克尔，迈克尔，如果你爱我，如果你那副铁石心肠里还有一点柔情，让我喝杯啤酒吧。”

“朱莉娅。”

“就这一次。我并没有经常让你为我做一些事情。”

“好吧，在你今晚这么精彩的演出后，我想我没办法拒绝你，但明天我一定会让菲利普斯小姐整治你一番。”

朱莉娅上了床，两脚放到了热水袋上，欢喜地看了看自己玫瑰粉和淡青色的房间，摆着金色天使的梳妆桌，心满意足地叹了口气。她觉得这一切多么有蓬巴杜夫人(1)的格调啊。她熄了灯，但毫无睡意。她很想去奎格饭店跳舞，但不是和迈克尔一起，而是和路易十五国王(2)或者巴伐利亚的路德维希(3)或是阿尔弗雷德·德·缪塞(4)跳舞。号角和法国歌剧舞会。她想起查尔斯送她的那幅画像。此刻她的心情同那时一般。她已经很久没有过这样刺激的经历了。她本应该为那段小插曲而感到羞愧；天哪，事后她感到非常害怕，但事实上每当她回忆起此事都会咯咯笑起来。

那也是一次偶然事件。那时她一直都有演出，从未休息，而她急需一次休假。她出演的戏剧不再卖座，而他们即将开始排练新剧，就在这时，迈克尔将剧院租给了一家法国公司六周时间。朱莉娅正好有时间休假。多莉在戛纳租了一幢房子准备在那里度过这个季节，朱莉娅可以去和她待一阵子。她离开时正好在复活节前夕，开往南方去的火车上十分拥挤，朱莉娅没能买到卧铺，但是库克公司的人说没有问题，而且到了巴黎车站就可以为她找到卧铺。令她惊慌的是，在他们到达巴黎后，她发现根本没有人知道她卧铺的事，列车长告诉她所有的卧铺都有人了，唯一的可能性仰仗于有人最后没来坐火车。她非常不喜欢在一等座的角落里坐一整夜这个想法，于是神情忧郁地去吃了晚饭。她坐在一张两人位的餐桌旁，不久一个男人走了过来，坐在她的对面。她并没有注意他。此刻，列车长对她说十分抱歉，却也帮不上什么忙。她闹了一番，但无济于事。列车长走后，坐在她对面的男人开始同她讲话。虽然他说的法语非常流利地道，但她注意到他并非法国人。面对他的询问，她礼貌地同他讲了她的遭遇，并说了她对库克公司、火车公司以及人类办事低效的意见。他表示很同情，并说吃完晚饭后他会去车厢里看看，说不定哪个列车员能够帮忙安排一下。说不定有哪位列车员收了小费后能把事情办妥。

“我简直要累死了，”她说道，“我愿意出五百法郎买一个卧铺。”

对话就这样开始了，他说他是巴黎西班牙使馆的一个专员，准备去戛纳过复活节。虽然她同他聊了近一刻钟，但她并没费心观察他的长相。现在她注意到他长着胡子，黑色拳曲的络腮胡和黑色拳曲的八字胡，但胡子在他脸上长得很奇怪，两个嘴角下面有两块斑，让人感觉很古怪。再加上他黑色的头发，下垂的眼皮和长长的鼻子，他让她想起见过的某个人。突然间她记起来了，脱口而出：

“你知道吗，我刚才怎么也想不起来你让我想起了谁。你特别像提香(5)为弗朗西斯一世画的肖像，挂在罗浮宫的那幅。”

“有一双细小的猪眼睛那幅？”

“不，你的眼睛很大，我觉得是胡子很像。”

她瞥了一眼他眼睛下方的皮肤；肤色有些紫罗兰色，没有皱纹。虽然长着让人看起来显老的胡子，但他还是一个年轻人；他不超过三十岁。她在想他是不是一位西班牙大公。他穿得并不考究，但外国人经常穿得一般；他的衣服可能花了不少钱，虽然剪裁拙劣；而他的领带，虽然花里胡哨，但她认出那是夏尔凡(6)牌子的。在他们餐后喝咖啡时，他提议能否请她喝一杯酒。

“您真是太好了。这或许会让我睡得好一些。”

他递了一支烟给她。他的烟盒是银色的，她不喜欢，但当他合上烟盒时，她注意到烟盒的角落处镶着一枚金色的小皇冠。他准是一位伯爵什么的。银色烟盒上镶金色的皇冠真是别致，真可惜他得穿着那些现代衣服！如果他穿得像弗朗西斯一世，他会看起来很出挑。她竭力做出优雅的样子。

“我觉得我应该告诉你，”他说道，“我认识您。允许我加一句，我对您非常敬慕。”

她用她那漂亮的眼睛盯了他一会儿。

“您看过我演出？”

“是的，上个月我在伦敦。”

“那是个有趣的小戏剧，是吧？”

“是您让它变得有趣的。”

当侍者过来收费，她坚持自己付她自己的账单。这个西班牙人陪她去了车厢，说他会去看一看能否帮她找到一个卧铺。一刻钟后他走了回来，带来一位列车员，告诉她他为她找到一间小包房，如果她把行李交给列车员，他会带她过去。她非常高兴。他把自己的帽子扔在她腾出来的空位上，朱莉娅沿走廊跟着他。到达包房后，他吩咐列车员把行李架上的手提箱和公文包拿到这位女士原来的那节车厢去。

“您把您的包房让给了我？”朱莉娅叫道。

“这是火车上唯一的一间。”

“但我不能要。”

“拿走吧。”西班牙人对列车员说道。

“不，不。”

列车员看到陌生人的点头示意，拿走了行李。

“我不介意。我可以在任何地方睡觉，但一想到如此伟大的艺术家要在一个拥挤的车厢里同其他三人过夜，我一刻钟也无法合眼。”

朱莉娅继续抗议，但没有过分强调。他太有心了。她不知道如何感谢他。他甚至不让她付卧铺的钱。他眼中几乎含着泪地恳求她，允许他享有这非凡的特权为她献上这微不足道的礼物。她随身只带着一个化妆包，里面放着她的面霜、睡衣和她上厕所用的东西。他把这包放到桌子上。他只请求能够和她坐一会，抽一两支烟，到她想睡觉。朱莉娅无法拒绝。床已经铺好，他们坐在上面。几分钟后，列车员带来一瓶香槟和两个杯子。这是一次特别的小经历，朱莉娅享受其中。他非常有礼貌，很是殷勤，这些外国人明白应该如何对待一位有名的女演员。当然，伯恩哈特每天都碰得到这种事情。还有西登斯，当她走进客厅，所有人都会起立，好像她是皇族一样。他恭维她那一口流利的法语。生于泽西，在法国受教育？哦，难怪。但为什么她没选择用法语演戏而是英语？如果她用法语演戏，准会和杜丝一样有名气。她让他想起杜丝，同样动人的眼睛，白皙的皮肤，而她的表演中也同样富有情感以及出奇的自然。

他们喝了半瓶香槟，朱莉娅意识到已经很晚了。

“我觉得我应该睡了。”

“那我应该走了。”

他起身，亲吻了她的手。当他走后，朱莉娅插上插销，脱了衣服。她关掉了包房内所有的灯，只留了头顶上的一盏，开始阅读。不久，有人敲门。

“谁？”

“非常抱歉打扰您。我把我的牙刷忘在洗手间了。我能拿一下吗？”

“我上床了。”

“我不刷牙睡不着。”

“好吧，他倒是很爱干净。”

朱莉娅耸了耸肩，伸手拔出插销。这种情况下装正经就太愚蠢了。他走了进来，走进洗手间，不一会儿就出来了，挥舞着一把牙刷。当她刷牙时她就注意到那牙刷了，以为是隔壁包房的。那时两间包房共享一个洗手间。此刻西班牙人似乎注意到那了瓶酒。

“我很渴，您介意我喝一杯香槟吗？”

朱莉娅沉默了一秒。那是他的香槟，他的包房。嗯，好吧，一不做，二不休。

“当然不介意。”

他给自己倒了一杯，点了一支烟，坐在她的床的边缘。她挪了挪，给他腾出一些空间。对此他认为理所当然。

“您根本无法在那车厢睡觉，”他说道，“那儿有个人呼吸声很重。我倒更愿意他直接打鼾，这样就可以把他叫醒了。”

“真抱歉。”

“哦，没关系。最不济我就在您门外的走廊上蜷一晚。”

“他不会期望我邀请他跟我一起睡在这里吧，”朱莉娅对自己说道，“我开始觉得这一切都是设计好的圈套。休想，小伙子。”然后她大声说道：“很浪漫，当然，但不舒服。”

“您真是太迷人了。”

她庆幸自己的睡衣很漂亮，并且还没有涂面霜。事实上，她还没卸妆。她的嘴唇鲜红，在身后的阅读灯的映衬下，她非常清楚自己看上去并不糟糕。但她讥讽地回答道：

“如果你觉得因为你把包房让给了我，我就允许你跟我睡觉，那么你想错了。”

“正如您所说的，当然。但是为什么不呢？”

“我不是那种十分迷人的女人。”

“那您是什么样的女人？”

“一个忠贞的妻子和一位慈爱的母亲。”

他叹了口气。

“好吧，那我跟您道晚安了。”

他把烟头掐灭在烟灰缸中，握了她的手，并亲吻了它。他的嘴唇顺着她的胳膊慢慢地往上移。这动作让朱莉娅感到一阵兴奋。男人的胡子让她的皮肤发痒。然后他俯下身，亲吻了她的嘴唇。他的胡子有种霉味，她觉得很特别；她不确定这味道让她反感还是让她兴奋。说起来也奇怪，她想起她从未被长胡子的男人亲吻过。似乎这样很不得体。他关掉了灯。

直到亮光透过窗帘的缝隙提醒他们天已破晓，他才离开她。朱莉娅心灵和肉体都垮了。

“我们到达戛纳时，我肯定没个人样了。”

太冒险了！他很有可能会谋杀她或者偷她的珍珠项链。回想起她给自己招来的危险，她的身子一阵冷一阵热。他也去戛纳。假设在那儿他声称自己是她的熟人，她如何将他介绍给她的朋友？她很确定，多莉不会喜欢他。他可能会勒索她。要是他想再来一次这种事，她该怎么应付？毫无疑问，他很热情，他已经问过她会待在哪里，虽然朱莉娅没有告诉他，但如果他想查他一定能查到；在戛纳这种地方，避免和他相遇几乎不可能。他可能会对她纠缠不休。如果他像他说的那样爱慕她，他不可能就此罢休，而且外国人都不可靠，他可能会大闹一场。唯一的慰藉是他只在戛纳待到复活节后，她可以装作很累，告诉多莉她更愿意在别墅里安静地待着。

“我怎么能这么愚蠢？”她生气地喊道。

多莉会在车站接她，如果他愚笨到上前来跟她说再见，她会跟多莉说他把自己的包房让给了她。这样就不会有什么问题。要尽可能地说实话。不料，戛纳站下了很多乘客，朱莉娅出了车站后直接上了多莉的车，并没有看到他。

“我今天什么都没有安排，”多莉说道，“我想你会很累，而且我想这二十四小时里单独和你待着。”

朱莉娅深情地抓了一下她的胳膊。

“太好了。我们就在别墅待着，敷敷脸，好好地聊天。”

但第二天，多莉已经对她们去哪里吃午饭做了安排，而且她们将会在克鲁瓦塞特河上的一个酒吧里会见他们的房东，一起喝鸡尾酒。天气真不错，风和日丽。她们下了车后，多莉停下来和司机交代什么时候接她们，朱莉娅在一旁等着。突然间，她的心脏猛地一跳，那个西班牙人正在朝她走来，而他身边有个女人挽着他的胳膊，另一边是个小女孩牵着他的手。她没有时间转过身去。就在那时，多莉和司机说完了话，准备同朱莉娅一起穿过马路。西班牙人走了过来，看了她一眼，似乎完全没有认出她来，他正在和身边的女人热切地交谈，就这样走了过去。就在这时，朱莉娅明白他同她一样不愿再和彼此相遇。那个女人和孩子很明显是他的妻子和女儿，他来戛纳同她们一起过复活节。真是让人松了口气！现在，她可以毫无担忧地尽情享受假期了。但当她陪多莉来到酒吧，朱莉娅心想男人们真是恶心。你简直无法相信他们的任何一句话。一个男人，有这样迷人的妻子和可爱的女儿，还在火车里跟别的女人乱搞，简直不要脸。你还以为他们会讲些体面。

不过，渐渐地，朱莉娅的愤怒消退了，后来常常满是喜悦地回想起这桩奇遇。毕竟这件事挺有趣。有时，她会任自己胡思乱想，在幻想中重复那一夜的事情。他是最适合不过的情人了。当她成为一个老女人，还有韵事可以追忆。他的胡子让她无法忘记，那种贴在她脸上的奇异的感觉，还有那淡淡的霉味，让她讨厌又令她感到刺激。这么多年来，她一直在寻找长胡子的男人，她觉得，如果这样一个男人向她求爱，她简直无法抗拒。但现在几乎没有男人留胡子，这对她来说是一件幸事，因为她一看见留胡子的男人膝盖就会有些发软，而留胡子的男人却又不来向她献殷勤。她很想知道那个西班牙人是谁。一两天后她在赌场看到他玩九点，于是询问了两三个人是否认识他。但没人知道，他就这样没有名字地停留在她的记忆中，她的身体里。巧合的是，她也不知道那日下午那个行为出人意料的年轻人叫什么。这让她觉得好笑。

“要是我事先知道他们要对我放肆就好了，我至少会跟他们要名片。”

想着这些，她开心地入睡了。

第十三章


几天后的一个早晨，朱莉娅正躺在床上阅读一个剧本，仆人从地下室打电话询问她是否要跟一位芬内尔先生通电话。她对这个名字没有任何印象，就在她要拒绝的时候，她突然想到可能是跟她艳遇的年轻人。她的好奇心促使她让他们接了电话。她认出了他的声音。

“你承诺要给我打电话的，”他说道，“我厌倦等待了，所以我给你打电话。”

“这几天我都非常忙。”

“我什么时候能去见你？”

“等我一有空的时候。”

“今天下午如何？”

“我今天有日场演出。”

“日场演出后来喝杯茶吧。”

她笑了。（“年轻的小家伙，不，你不能再那样对待我了。”）

“我做不到，”她回答道，“我会在更衣室休息，直到夜场演出。”

“你休息的时候难道我不能去见你吗？”

她犹豫了一下。或许最好让他过来；伊维进进出出，菲利普斯小姐也会在七点的时候过来，这样就不会有什么胡来的可能，而且这也是个不错的机会，能友善但是坚定地告诉他，那日下午的事情不会再发生了，哦，他真是个可爱的小东西。她要准备好说辞，向他解释清楚这事儿有多么荒谬，他必须答应她把整件事情从他的记忆中抹掉。

“好吧。五点半的时候过来，我请你喝杯茶。”

从下午到晚上演出之间她在化妆间里度过的那三个小时，是她繁忙的生活中最惬意的时刻。剧组的其他成员都走了；伊维会在那儿伺候她，门卫会保证她的隐私。她的化妆间就像一艘船的船舱。整个世界都远去，她享受这一刻的与世隔绝。她感到令人神往的自由。她会打个盹儿，读会儿书，或者在沙发上舒服地躺一会，任思绪随意飘荡。她会想她正在出演的角色，还有她曾经演过的最喜欢的角色。她想到她儿子罗杰。愉快的遐想在她的脑海里漫步，就像情人在树林里闲逛。她喜欢法国诗，有时会给自己背诵上一段魏尔伦(1)的诗句。

伊维在五点半的时候递给她一张名片。“托马斯·芬内尔先生。”她看着名片读道。

“带他进来，再上些茶。”

她已经决定要如何对待他。她会很亲切，但会保持距离。她会对他的工作表示出友善的兴趣，并询问他的考试进展如何。然后她会跟他聊一聊罗杰。罗杰已经十七岁了，还有一年就会去剑桥读书。她会暗示他，以她的年纪都可以做他的母亲了。她会假装他们之间从未发生过任何事情，然后他会主动离开。此后，除非透过舞台前的脚灯观看她的演出，他再也不会见到她，甚至会觉得整件事情都是他脑子里虚构的。但当她见到他时，看着他那瘦小的身板、潮红的面颊，还有他那双蓝色的眼睛，如此迷人又带着孩子气，心里突然一阵剧痛。伊维离开房间并关上了门。朱莉娅躺在沙发上，她伸出胳膊，将手递给他，嘴唇上浮现雷卡米埃夫人(2)般优雅的微笑，但他却一下子跪倒在地，狂吻起她来。她亦情不自禁，两只胳膊搂住他的脖子，热情地回吻他。

（“哦，我的决心。上帝，我不会爱上他了吧。”）

“看在上帝的分上，坐下吧。伊维一会儿就送上茶来。”

“告诉她别打扰我们。”

“你什么意思？”但他的意思非常明确。她的心脏开始加速跳动，“那太荒谬了，我不能。迈克尔可能会过来。”

“我想要你。”

“你觉得伊维会怎么想？冒这种险简直愚蠢到家了。不，不，不。”

门外有敲门声，伊维端着茶走了进来。朱莉娅让她把桌子摆在她沙发旁，在沙发另一边摆一把椅子，让年轻人坐。她和伊维说着没必要的对话。她感觉到他在看她。他的眼睛移动得很快，跟随着她的手势和她脸上的表情；她回避那双眼睛，但她能感觉到那眼神中的焦虑以及他迫不及待的欲望。她心慌意乱，觉得自己的声音听起来不那么自然。

（“我到底是怎么了？上帝，我几乎无法呼吸。”）

当伊维准备离开时，男孩做了个手势，这手势完全出于本能，与其说朱莉娅看到了他的手势倒不如说她感受到了。她无法直视他。他的脸变得无比苍白。

“哦，伊维，”她说道，“这位绅士想跟我谈论一个剧本。别让别人打扰我。我需要你时会按铃。”

“好的，小姐。”

伊维离开房间并关上了房门。

（“我是个笨蛋。我是个该死的笨蛋。”）

他挪开了桌子，双膝跪地，将她抱在怀中。

菲利普斯小姐快来的时候，她才打发他走了，并按铃叫了伊维。

“剧本不错吗？”伊维问道。

“什么剧本？”

“他跟您讨论的剧本啊。”

“他很聪明。当然他还年轻。”

伊维低头看了一眼梳妆台。朱莉娅喜欢一切都放在原有的位置，如果有瓶油膏或者睫毛膏没有被一丝不差地放回到原来的位置，她会发脾气。

“你的梳子呢？”

他刚刚用梳子梳过头，粗心地将它放在了茶桌上。当伊维看到梳子时，她若有所思地盯着梳子好一会儿。

“这梳子怎么跑到那儿去了？”朱莉娅轻声喊道。

“我还在想呢。”

这让朱莉娅措手不及。在化妆间做那种事情当然荒唐至极。天，锁眼里都没有插把钥匙。伊维保管钥匙。尽管如此，这种危险也增添了一丝刺激。想想她竟能这样疯狂就觉得有趣。他们现在已经订好了约会的日子。汤姆，她问他在家里他父母如何称呼他，他回答托马斯，而她无法称呼他这个。汤姆想带她去能跳舞的地方吃晚饭，他想和她跳舞，正好迈克尔要去剑桥待一晚上，排练大学生写的一系列独幕剧。他们能在一起待上好几个小时。

“你可以天亮了再回。”他说道。

“那我第二天的演出怎么办？”

“我们顾不上为此担心。”

她没有让他来剧院接她，当她到达他们选好的饭店时，他正在大厅里等她。在见到她的那一刻，他的脸上浮现喜悦之情。

“这么晚了，我担心你不会来了。”

“对不起，有些无聊的人在演出结束后过来找我，我无法摆脱他们。”

然而，事实并非如此。整个晚上，朱莉娅兴奋得好像第一次参加舞会的小女孩。她不由得想自己有多可笑。当她卸掉舞台妆容，为了赴宴重新打扮后，她又觉得不满意。她涂了蓝色的眼影，又擦掉，涂了腮红，又抹干净，换了另外一种颜色。

“您这是要做什么？”伊维问道。

“我想看起来像二十岁，你这个笨蛋。”

“如果再化下去，您看起来就像您现在的年纪了。”

她从未见过他穿晚礼服。他光芒四射如同一枚崭新的大头针。虽然他也就是普通个子，但瘦削的体形让他看上去很高。尽管他装出一副阅历丰富的样子，领班侍者为他们点菜时，他仍旧露出羞涩的模样，这让她有些感动。他们跳了舞，他跳得不好，不过，朱莉娅觉得他略微笨拙的样子很迷人。人们认出了她，她也意识到大家的注视让他觉得脸上有光。一对跳舞的年轻人走到他们的桌子前，向她问好。当他们离开后，他问道：

“那不是丹诺伦特侯爵和侯爵夫人吗？”

“是的。乔治还在伊顿公学读书时我就认识他了。”

汤姆目送他们离去。

“她本是塞西莉·劳斯顿小姐，对吗？”

“我忘记了，是吗？”

似乎朱莉娅对她一点兴趣都没有。不一会儿，又有一对儿从他们身边经过。

“看，那是莱巴德夫人。”

“她是谁？”

“你不记得了吗？几周前他们在位于柴郡的家中举办了一场盛大的聚会，威尔士亲王也去了。《旁观者》上登着呢。”

哦，他的消息都是从那儿得来的。可怜的小东西。他在报纸上读到那些名人的事情，时不时地会在饭店或者剧院看到他们本人。这对他来讲当然非常兴奋。浪漫。要是他知道他们有多无聊就好了！那种对于照片被登在画报上的人们的无邪的热情让他显得非常幼稚，她看着他，眼神中充满温柔。

“你以前有带过别的女演员来吃晚餐吗？”

他的脸变得通红。

“从来没有。”

她不愿让他付账单，她大概能猜到，这顿饭差不多花了他一周的薪水，但她明白，如果她提出付钱，会伤到他的自尊心。她随意地问了问时间，他本能地看了看手腕。

“我忘记戴手表了。”

她疑惑地看着他。

“你是把它当了吗？”

他又一次红了脸。

“不。我今晚穿衣服太着急了。”

只需看一眼他的领带，她就知道事实并非他所说的那样。他在骗她。她知道，为了请她吃晚餐，他当了自己的手表。她有些哽咽，恨不得立刻就将他拥入怀中并亲吻他蓝色的眼睛。她爱慕他。

“我们走吧。”她说道。

他们开车回到了他在塔维斯托克广场卧室兼客厅的家。

第十四章


第二天，朱莉娅去了卡地亚商店，买了一块手表送给汤姆·芬内尔，以补偿他当掉的那只。两三周后，正好是他的生日，她又送了他一个金烟盒。

“你知道吗，这是我这辈子最想要的东西。”

她在想他眼睛里是否有泪水。他激动地亲吻她。

在此之后，借着各种理由，她送了他珍珠饰纽、袖口链扣、马甲纽扣。给他准备礼物让她觉得兴奋无比。

“我什么都给不了你，这让我太难受了。”他说道。

“给我那只你为了请我吃饭而当掉的手表。”

那是一只小小的金表，价钱不会超过十英镑，但她喜欢时不时戴一下。

直到他们第一次共进晚餐之后，朱莉娅才肯承认，她爱上了汤姆。这件事情让她觉得震惊，但同时她也感到振奋。

“我以为我再也不会恋爱了。当然这段感情不会持续。但为什么我不能及时行乐呢？”

她决定一定要让他再来斯坦霍普广场。没过多久，机会就出现了。

“你还记得你的那个年轻会计吧，”她向迈克尔说道，“他叫汤姆·芬内尔。前几天晚上我出去吃晚餐时遇上了他，于是我邀请他下周日参加宴会。我们需要一个临时凑数的男宾客。”

“哦，你觉得他行吗？”

这是一个很盛大的宴会。就是因为这个缘故她邀请了他。她觉得能当面见到只在照片里见过的人，对他来说一定很开心。她已经意识到，他有些势利眼。这样更好；她可以介绍他认识他想认识的那些聪明人。朱莉娅很精明，她很清楚汤姆并不爱她。跟她发生感情纠葛纯粹为了满足他的虚荣心。他是一个性欲强烈的年轻男人，喜欢性生活。从一些暗示以及她逼他说出的故事来看，他从十七岁开始就跟很多女人上过床。他爱性本身而不是那个人。他把性爱看作天下最大的乐趣。而且她能理解为什么他在女人中间这么成功。他那副清瘦的身体有一些吸引人的东西，他瘦得皮包骨头，正因如此，他的衣服才显得那么合身，他的清秀干净让人着迷。他的羞涩加上他的胆大妄为让他令人无法抗拒。当一个妇人被当作年轻女子，会让她倍感荣幸，以至于就会干脆翻滚到床上去。

“当然，他所拥有的是性感。”

她知道，他的美貌来自他的年轻。当他变老时，他会变得干瘪、枯瘦、憔悴；他脸蛋儿上那迷人的潮红会变成紫光，而他精致的皮肤会布满皱纹，面露憔悴；可是，一想到她所爱上的关于他的一切只能持续短暂的时间，这种感觉让她内心更加充满柔情。她对他心生异样的怜悯之情。他富有青春活力，而她像小猫舔奶一样贪婪地享受着他的气息。但他并不是一个有趣的人。虽然他也会被朱莉娅的笑话逗乐，但他自己从没讲过笑话。她并不介意。他的沉闷让她感到宁静。跟他在一起时，她感到前所未有的轻松愉快，而她一个人的活跃足以抵得上两个人的。

人们不停地告诉朱莉娅她看起来年轻了十岁，并且她的表演空前优秀。她知道这是真的而且她知道这其中的原因。但她必须谨慎行事。她必须保持头脑清醒。查尔斯·泰默利总是说，一个女演员所需要的并不是聪慧，而是敏感，对于这一点他或许是对的；也许她并不聪明，但她的直觉敏锐，她相信自己的直觉。而她的直觉告诉她，绝对不能告诉汤姆她爱上了他。

她小心翼翼地告诉他，她并不想占有他，他可以自由地做他喜欢做的事情。她展示出一副认为此事荒唐可笑的态度，双方都不必看得过重。然而事实上她竭尽全力束缚住他，使他为她所有。他喜欢聚会，于是她带他去各种聚会。她让多莉和查尔斯·泰默利邀请他共进午宴。他喜欢跳舞，她就为他拿到舞会邀请。为了他，她会亲自去这些舞会，待上一个小时，她看得出，当周围的人围着她转的时候，他有多得意。她知道他被那些大人物吸引，于是她介绍他认识这些社会名流。幸运的是，迈克尔也喜欢他。迈克尔喜欢说教，而汤姆是个不错的倾听者。他在自己业务方面很精明。一天，迈克尔对她说：

“汤姆真是个聪明的家伙。他对所得税很懂行。他告诉我一种方法，能为我下次报税节省那么两三百英镑。”

正在寻找新演员的迈克尔，经常在晚上带他去看戏剧，要么在伦敦，或者是郊区，演出结束后他们会接上朱莉娅，三人共进晚餐。有时，迈克尔会邀请汤姆星期天一起打高尔夫，如果当天没有聚会，他会带汤姆回家一起吃晚餐。

“有个像他那样的年轻人在身边真不错，”他说道，“他让人不会老得生锈。”

汤姆非常喜欢这栋房子。他会和迈克尔玩西洋双陆棋，或者和朱莉娅玩单人纸牌戏，如果他们打开留声机，他便会负责更换唱片。

“对罗杰来说他会是个不错的朋友，”迈克尔说道，“汤姆头脑清醒，又比罗杰大许多。他应该会对罗杰产生很好的影响。不如邀请他和我们一起度假？”

（“幸亏我是个好演员。”）但她仍旧努力克制了一下自己，才避免那让她心脏怦怦直跳的狂喜从她的声音和脸上流露出来。“这主意倒不错，”她回答道，“如果你愿意，我会问问他。”

他们的戏剧会一直演到八月底，迈克尔在塔普洛租了一栋别墅，他们会在那儿度过盛夏。朱莉娅得去市里演出，迈克尔有业务需要时也得赶到市里去，但她白天和星期天都会待在乡下。汤姆有两星期假期，他欣然接受了邀请。

但有一天，朱莉娅注意到汤姆异常沉默。他脸色苍白，那生龙活虎的劲头也离他而去。她知道肯定有什么不对劲，但他不肯告诉她是什么；他只是说自己担心死了。最后，她强迫他坦白，原来他向一些商人借了钱，现在他被催着还债。她带他进入的生活圈子让他入不敷出，而跟她去参加盛大的宴会时，他羞于穿自己那廉价的衣服，于是他去了一家昂贵的裁缝铺，给自己定制了几套西服。为了还上这笔钱，他去赌马，结果他下赌注的马输掉了比赛。对于朱莉娅来说，他欠的钱不算什么，区区一百二十五英镑，在她看来，为了这样一件小事烦恼实在荒谬。她立刻说，她会给他这笔钱。

“哦，我不能。我不能拿一个女人的钱。”

他脸红了；仅仅是这种想法就让他感到耻辱。朱莉娅尽其甜言蜜语之所能。她跟他讲道理，她假装被冒犯，她甚至流了几滴眼泪，最终，算是他给她帮忙，才同意从她这里借走这笔钱。第二天，她给他送了封信，里面是两百英镑的银行支票。他给她打电话，告诉她那钱远远超出了他想要的。

“哦，我知道人们总是隐瞒他们欠债的真实数字，”她笑着说道，“我肯定你欠的钱比你告诉我的还要多。”

“我向你保证我没有说谎。我不会对你说谎。”

“那剩下的就以备不时之需吧。我讨厌我们出去吃晚餐时看你结账。还有出租车费和其他费用。”

“不，真的。这太丢人了。”

“真是胡说八道！你知道我的钱多得都不知如何处置。你连让我帮你摆脱困境从而获得的快乐都要吝惜吗？”

“你真的太好了。你不知道这对于我来说是多么大的解脱。我不知如何感谢你。”

但他的声音听起来很不安。可怜的年轻人，他太传统了。但她刚刚所说的是真的，给他钱让她体会到之前从未有过的激动；它在她的内心搅动起意外的激情。她在脑子里盘算好了另一个计谋，当汤姆和他们在塔普洛一起度假时，她可以轻松地实施。汤姆在塔维斯托克广场的那个卧室兼客厅的房子虽然乍看起来别有情趣，那些简陋的家具曾感动过她。但时间已经剥夺掉这些感动。有一两次，她在楼梯间遇到一些人，感觉他们都在用奇怪的眼神盯着她。有一个不检点的女管家打扫汤姆的房间，为他做早饭，朱莉娅觉得那女人知道他们之间的事情，并且在暗中监视自己。有一次朱莉娅在屋子里的时候有人试图打开锁着的门，当她离开时，那女管家正在打扫楼梯的扶栏。她厌恶地看了一眼朱莉娅。朱莉娅讨厌楼梯间弥漫着的发霉食物的味道，她那犀利的眼神不久就发现汤姆的房间也没那么干净。肮脏的窗帘，破烂的地毯，劣质的家具；这些都让她感到厌烦。正巧在不久前，一直在寻找合适投资的迈克尔在斯坦霍普广场附近买进了一排汽车间。他发现，如果把自己不用的租出去，自用的就可以不花一分钱。汽车间上面有好几个房间。他把它们分成两套小公寓，一套给他们的司机用，另一套他建议租出去。这套公寓目前还空着，朱莉娅向汤姆建议他应该租下来。那样的话就太棒了。他下班后她可以溜过去，和他待上一个小时；有时演出结束后她也可以顺道过去，没人会晓得。他们可以在那里逍遥自在。她同他讲起他们一起装饰屋子的乐趣；她敢肯定他们的房子里有很多他们不想要的东西，储存在他那里，也算帮了他们的忙。其余的他们可以一起购买。对于拥有自己的公寓这想法他有些心动，但根本不可能；那租金即使很少，也已超出了他的承受范围。朱莉娅知道这一点。她也知道如果她建议由她来出这笔钱他会很有骨气地拒绝。然而她想，在河畔悠闲而舒适的两个星期假期，她准能消除他的顾虑。她看出这个主意对他的诱惑有多大，她完全有把握想出办法使他相信他同意她的建议其实是帮她的忙。

“人们做他们想要做的事情不需要真正的理由，”她想道，“他们所要的其实是借口。”

朱莉娅满是兴奋地期待着汤姆来塔普洛做客。那样，她就可以同他早晨在河里泛舟，下午在花园里闲逛，多浪漫。由于罗杰就在身边，她决定他们之间不能胡来；攸关体面。但能够和他整天相处，就如同在天堂一样。当她有日场演出的时候，他可以和罗杰一起玩。

但事情跟她想象的完全不一样。她怎么也没想到，罗杰和汤姆会彼此喜欢，一拍即合。他们之间相差五岁，她想——或者说她曾考虑过这个问题的话——汤姆会把罗杰看成一个青少年，当然是个不错的小伙子，但也只是个小孩子，能帮你拿拿东西，当你不想被他打扰就可以打发他去自己玩。罗杰十七岁了。他长相不错，长着红色的头发和蓝色的眼睛，但是你所能夸他的也就是这些了。他既没有他母亲的活力和丰富的表情，也没有继承他父亲的俊朗。朱莉娅对他有些失望。当他还是个孩子时，朱莉娅经常和他照相，那时候他可爱极了。现在他有些迟钝，总是一副一本正经的样子。坦白讲，如果你仔细观察他，他唯一值得一提的就是他的牙齿和他的头发。朱莉娅很喜欢他，但觉得他有些愚钝呆板。当她单独和他在一起时，时间总是过得有些沉重缓慢。她跟他谈曲棍球这些她认为他一定会感兴趣的事情，但他对这些似乎也没什么可说的。她担心他不够聪明。

“当然他还很小，”她满是希望地说道，“可能等他长大一些就会变好。”

自打他上预备学校开始她就几乎不怎么见他。假期期间，她夜间总是演戏，他会跟他父亲或者别的男生朋友一同出去，星期天的时候他和他父亲会一起打高尔夫。如果碰上她中午出去吃饭，很有可能她两三天都不会见到他，除了早晨他去她房间的那短短几分钟。真可惜他无法一直都是那个可爱漂亮的小男孩，可以在她房间里玩耍但不会打扰到她，能笑嘻嘻地冲着照相机，一手搂着她的脖子，跟她一起拍照。有时她会去伊顿公学看望他，和他一起喝茶。当她看到他房间摆着几张她的照片时着实让她受宠若惊。她知道，当她去伊顿的时候，会在校园里多少引起一些轰动，而他的寄宿家庭的主人——布拉肯布里奇先生对她殷勤备至。半学年结束后，迈克尔和朱莉娅已经搬到了塔普洛，罗杰也直接回到了那里。朱莉娅热情地亲吻他。他并没有她期待的那样兴奋。他漫不经心，似乎突然间变得老成世故。

他随即告诉朱莉娅他想在圣诞节的时候离开伊顿，他认为他已经学到那里可以教给他的一切东西，他想去维也纳待几个月，在去剑桥之前学习德文。迈克尔本希望他去参军，但他坚决不同意。他还不知道自己将来想做什么。朱莉娅和迈克尔从一开始就非常担心他会选择登台做演员，但他似乎对此毫无兴趣。

“反正他什么事也成不了。”朱莉娅说道。

他过自己的日子。他去河边或者在花园里躺着看书。他十七岁生日时，朱莉娅送了他一辆时髦的敞篷车，于是他就开着它以极其危险的速度在乡间乱窜。

“有一点倒是很欣慰，”朱莉娅说道，“他倒不是个麻烦鬼。他自娱自乐的能力倒是不错。”

星期天，很多客人来他们家里做客，有男演员和女演员，一位应时作家，还有零星几个他们的名人朋友。朱莉娅发现这些聚会非常有趣，她知道人们喜欢来他们家里做客。在罗杰回家后的第一个星期天，来了一大批客人。罗杰对客人们很礼貌。他像个深谙世故的老手，作为主人之一，尽责地招待客人。但在朱莉娅看来，他显得说不出的冷漠，好像他在扮演一个他并没有投入其中的角色，而且她有种不安的感觉：他对这些人完全不接受，而且在冷眼评判他们。她的印象是，他一点都不把这些人当回事儿。

汤姆计划下个周六到达，她会在演出结束后开车带他去乡下。那是个月光如水的夜晚，那个时间路上已经空无一人。开车让人着迷。朱莉娅想要这么一直开下去。她依偎在他身上，而他不时地在黑暗中亲吻她。

“你开心吗？”她问道。

“当然。”

迈克尔和罗杰已经休息，餐厅里还放着晚餐。这幢寂静无声的房子使他们感到自己仿佛不请自来。他们可能是一对流浪者，夜里漫步到一幢陌生的房子，发现了一桌丰盛的饭菜摆在他们眼前。真是浪漫，甚至有些《天方夜谭》里故事的味道。朱莉娅带汤姆看了他的房间，就在罗杰房间的隔壁，之后就去休息了。她一直睡到第二天早上很晚才醒。那是个晴朗的日子。为了能和汤姆独处，她并没有邀请其他人来做客。当她穿好衣服，他们会一起去河里泛舟。她吃了早饭，沐了浴。她穿了一件和阳光明媚的河岸景色很协调的白色连衣裙，戴了一顶红色宽檐草帽，这帽子的颜色给她脸上抹了一层温暖的光泽。她几乎没有化妆。她照了照镜子，满意地笑了笑。她看上去非常年轻漂亮。她漫步到花园，那儿有一片草地延伸到河边，她看到迈克尔被一堆星期天的报纸包围着。他独自一人。

“我以为你去打高尔夫了。”

“没有，那俩男孩去了。我想如果我让他们单独去，他们能玩得尽兴。”他友好地笑了笑，“对我来说他们有些太活跃了。他们今早八点就在洗澡，吞下早餐后立刻就开着罗杰的车走了。”

“我很高兴他们能成为朋友。”

朱莉娅是认真的。不能和汤姆一起去河边让她有点失望，不过她很希望罗杰喜欢汤姆，她有种直觉：罗杰不会随意喜欢某个人；反正她能和汤姆一起待两个星期。

“我不介意告诉你，他们让我觉得自己是个该死的中年人。”迈克尔说道。

“胡说。你比他们都漂亮，你知道的，我的宝贝。”

迈克尔微微扬起下巴，缩了缩肚子。

男孩们直到午饭快准备好的时候才回来。

“对不起，我们回来得太晚了，”罗杰说道，“那儿乌泱乌泱的都是人，几乎每个发球区我们都得排队等着，我俩打了个平手。”

他们又饿又渴，又兴奋又满足。

“今天这里没请别人真是太好了，”罗杰说道，“我还担心你会请一堆人来做客，我们不得不表现得像小绅士一样。”

“我想休息一下会很不错。”朱莉娅说道。

罗杰看了她一眼。

“休息一下会对你有好处，妈妈。你看起来非常疲惫。”

（“他那双该死的眼睛。我绝对不能表现出我会介意。感谢上帝，我能表演。”）

她开心地笑了笑。

“我昨晚一夜未眠，在想我们到底要怎么处理你的那些粉刺。”

“我知道，简直太让人讨厌了，不是吗？汤姆说他曾经也长过。”

朱莉娅看了汤姆一眼。他穿着网球衫，领口敞开，头发蓬松，阳光照射着他的脸，他看起来难以置信的年轻。他看上去一点都不比罗杰大。

“不论怎样，他的鼻子都会蜕皮，”罗杰笑着说道，“那时他就成了一道风景了。”

朱莉娅感到微微的不适。在她看来，似乎汤姆摆脱了那年长的几岁，以至于他不仅仅在年龄上变成了罗杰的同龄人。他们讨论一堆无聊的事情。他们食量巨大，还大杯大杯地喝啤酒。迈克尔，饮食依旧极为节制，充满乐趣地看着他们。他欣赏他们的年轻和旺盛的精力。他让朱莉娅想起一只躺着晒太阳的老狗，轻轻地在地上拍打着自己的尾巴，看着一对小狗在它身边玩闹。他们在草坪上喝了咖啡。朱莉娅觉得在那儿的阴凉里坐着，看着小河，非常舒适。汤姆穿着白色长裤，显得修长又优雅。她以前从未见过他抽烟斗。她觉得他这样子莫名动人。但是罗杰在取笑他。

“你抽烟斗是因为它让你感到更男人还是因为你喜欢？”

“闭嘴。”汤姆说道。

“咖啡喝完了？”

“是的。”

“走吧，我们到河上去。”

汤姆向她抛去一个疑惑的眼神，被罗杰看到了。

“哦，没事的，你无须为我尊敬的双亲操心，他们有星期天的报纸陪伴。妈妈刚刚送了我一艘赛艇。”

（“我不能发脾气。我不能发脾气。我怎么这么蠢，为什么要送他一艘赛艇？”）

“好吧，”她说道，脸上带着宽容的微笑，“去河上玩吧，但小心别掉下去。”

“即使掉下去了也不会伤到我们。我们会回来喝茶的。球场标好了吗，爸爸？喝完茶我们想去打网球。”

“我敢说你父亲能再喊来一个人，这样你就能打双打了。”

“哦，没关系。单打更有趣，而且运动量也更大。”然后罗杰对汤姆说，“我们赛跑，看谁先到船屋。”

汤姆飞奔而去，罗杰紧随其后。迈克尔拿起一份报纸，找着他的眼镜。

“他们处得不错，不是吗？”

“看来是这样。”

“我担心罗杰在这儿跟我们单独待着会很无聊。有个人能陪他玩挺不错的。”

“你不觉得罗杰有点不体贴吗？”

“你是说打网球吗？哦，我亲爱的，我玩不玩无所谓。这俩男孩想自己玩再正常不过了。在他们看来，我是个老东西了，他们会觉得我会毁了他们的比赛。归根到底，最要紧的是他们玩得开心。”

朱莉娅深感内疚。迈克尔是很单调的，只知道鼓弄他的钱，还很自满，但他很善良，一点都不自私！他没有嫉妒之情。只要不花他的钱，使别人快乐会让他感到真正的满足。她对迈克尔的想法一清二楚。确实，他的思想一向平庸陈腐；但另一方面，他绝无半点让人羞耻的念头。他值得拥有她的爱慕之情，可她却不可抑制地对他生厌，这真让人懊恼。

“我觉得你作为一个男人比我作为一个女人要好得多，我的甜心。”她说道。

他冲她友善地笑了笑，轻轻地摇了摇头。

“不，亲爱的，我外表很棒，但你有天赋。”

朱莉娅咯咯笑了。你能从一个永远不知道你在说什么的男人身上得到不少乐趣。但当他们评论一个女演员有天赋的时候，他们到底指的是什么？朱莉娅也经常问自己，到底是什么让她置身于同辈人之上。她也曾被众人诋毁。有一段时间，朱莉娅总是被拿来和这个或者那个当时走红的女演员进行对她不利的比较，但现在没有人对她的卓越演技提出异议了。她确实不像电影明星那样在世界上享有盛名；她曾试过演电影，但并没有成功；她那张在舞台上灵活并富有表现力的脸在却不知为什么在电影银幕上不奏效。一次试镜后，在迈克尔的同意下，她拒绝再接受时不时向她投来的邀请。她那庄重的态度为她赢来不少有用的曝光。但朱莉娅并不嫉妒电影明星；他们来来去去；她一直都在。有机会时，她会去观看伦敦剧院里那些扮演主角的女演员的表演。她慷慨地赞美她们，而且她的赞美很真诚。有时，她甚至觉得她们演得那么好，以至于她无法理解为什么人们对她要大惊小怪。以她的聪明才智，她不可能不知道大众对她的评价，但她并没有恃才傲物，自视甚高。她的表演完全出于自然，根本没法想象可能有另外的表演方法，但是人们似痴若狂地叫好不止，这一直使她惊奇。评论家赞美她表演的多样性。他们尤其赞美她塑造角色的能力。她并没有意识到她在刻意地观察人们，但当她开始研习一个新角色时，种种模糊的回忆就不知从哪里涌现出来，于是她发现她知道她要演的这个角色的方方面面，而此前她对此毫不知情。想起她认识或者她在大街上、聚会上遇到的人都会对她有所帮助；然后她将这些回忆同她的个性相结合，这样就构建了一个基于事实但又被她的经验、表演技巧和惊人的吸引力丰富的人物形象。人们以为她只在台上的这两三个小时里进行表演；他们不知道当她表面上看起来全神贯注地跟别人讲话或者专注于什么事情的时候，她所扮演的角色都一直待在她的脑子里。她经常觉得，她是两个人：一个是女演员，受大众欢迎的、伦敦最会穿衣服的女人，这是个影子；而她晚上要扮演的那个女人，那是实质。

“我要是知道天赋是什么才见鬼呢，”她对自己说道，“但这一点我很肯定，如果我能变回十八岁，我会愿意付出一切。”

但她知道这不是真的。如果她有机会回到过去，她真的会吗？不。不会。她看重的，并不是知名度，或者你所谓的成名，也不是她对观众的掌控，观众对她怀有的真诚的爱，更不是这些所能带给她的金钱；她看重的，是她感到来自体内的力量，她对角色这种媒介的掌控，这让她欣喜若狂。她能进入一个角色，也许是一个不太好的角色，台词可笑，但凭借她的个性，她的灵巧机敏，她能够为这个角色注入生命。没有人能像她这样处理一个角色。有时，她感觉自己像上帝。

“而且，”她笑道，“汤姆那会儿也还没有出生呢。”

他愿意和罗杰一起玩是很自然的事情。他们属于一代人。今天是他假期的第一天，她必须让他好好享受；未来还有两周呢。他不久就会对跟一个十七岁的男孩整天待在一起感到厌倦。罗杰是很可爱，但他很无趣；她不打算因母爱而看不见这一点。她必须十分注意，不要显现出半点困扰的样子。从一开始她就下决心，她不会对汤姆有任何束缚；如果他感到他欠她什么，那会非常要命。

“迈克尔，为什么你不把那套公寓租给汤姆？现在他通过了考试，已经是一个注册会计了，不能继续在一间卧室兼客厅的房子里了。”

“这主意不错。我会向他建议的。”

“这样一来，也省去了中介的费用。我们能帮他装修房子。我们有一堆存起来不用的东西。与其放在阁楼里发霉，不如让他使用。”

汤姆和罗杰回来后吃了饱饱的一顿茶点，然后接着去打网球，直到天色暗了下来。晚饭后，他们玩多米诺骨牌。朱莉娅继续扮演一个年轻的母亲，欢喜地看着她的儿子和他的男伴朋友。她早早地上了床。不多一会儿，他们俩也上了楼。他们的房间就在她的正上方。她听到罗杰进入了汤姆的房间。他们开始聊天，她和他们房间的窗户都开着，她听到他们热烈交谈的声音。她恼怒着他们哪来那么多话聊。她一向觉得他们俩都不太健谈。不多一会儿后，迈克尔的声音打断了他们。

“现在，孩子们，你们都去睡觉。明天你们可以接着聊。”

她听到他们在笑。

“好的，爸爸。”罗杰喊道。

“一对话匣子，说你们俩呢。”

她又听到罗杰的声音。

“好的，晚安，老男孩。”

然后是汤姆衷心的回答：“再会，朋友。”

“白痴！”她生气地对自己说。

第二天早晨，当她正在吃早饭时，迈克尔走进她的房间。

“那俩男孩已经去亨特科姆打高尔夫了。他们想玩几轮，问是否需要回来吃午餐。我跟他们说不需要。”

“我不太喜欢汤姆把这里当成了旅店。”

“哦，我的宝贝，他们就是一对孩子。我说，让他们尽情开心吧。”

一整天她都见不到汤姆，为了及时赶到剧场，她必须五六点的时候就要起程前往伦敦。迈克尔当然可以一团和气地任凭他们怎么做。但她受伤了。她有点想哭。他准是没有把她放在心上，现在她心里想的全是汤姆；她本来下定决心，今天定要和昨日有所不同。她一醒来就抱定要宽容大度，要逆来顺受，但她没有准备好这当头一击。

“报纸送到了吗？”她闷闷不乐地问道。

她内心满是怒火地开车到了城里。

接下来的一天并没有好多少。男孩们没有去打高尔夫，但他们玩起了网球。他们无休止的活动深深地激怒了朱莉娅。汤姆穿着短裤，光着腿，上身穿板球衫，看起来不超过十六岁。他们一天洗三四次澡，他无法让自己的头发贴在头皮上，一旦头发干了，乱蓬蓬的鬈发就会铺满头顶。这样他看起来愈发年轻，但是，也更加迷人。朱莉娅心里难过。她感到他的行为莫名其妙地变了；有罗杰的陪伴，他已经不是那个伦敦城里对自己衣着小心翼翼、讲究着装合宜的年轻人了，他变成了一个懒散的小男生。他没有一点暗示，甚至没有一个眼神暴露过，他是她的情人；他对待她的态度就好像她只是罗杰的母亲。他说的每一句评论，无论淘气还是礼貌地讲，都在暗示她属于上一代人。他的行为没有丝毫向一个迷人女性献殷勤的意味，而是对一个没出嫁的姑姑所展示的宽容和亲切。

朱莉娅恼恨汤姆竟俯首帖耳地围着一个比他小得多的孩子转。这说明他缺乏个性。但是她不怪他；她怪罗杰。罗杰的自私令她厌恶。这也可以用他年纪还轻来搪塞。除了对他自己，他对别人的快乐的无动于衷显示出他可鄙的性情。他既不聪明也不体贴。他的所作所为就好像这房子、仆人，还有他的父母都是为了他的方便而存在的。她多次想要严厉训斥他，却总不敢在汤姆面前扮演一个训子的母亲的角色。并且，当你斥责罗杰的时候，他会表现出深深受伤的样子，像一头受惊的雌鹿，让人十分恼火，他会让你觉得你很不友善且不公正。她也可以展示出那个样子，那是他从她这里遗传的一种眼神；在舞台上她一次又一次地使用这种眼神以达到感人的效果，她知道这眼神说明不了什么，不过当她在他的眼睛里看到这种神情时，却让她心烦意乱。只要一想到他的这种眼神，就会让她对他变得温柔。那种情感上的突然变化让她看到了真相：她嫉妒罗杰，疯狂地嫉妒。这一认识多少让她有点震惊；她不知道该大笑还是该感到羞耻。她思索了一会儿。

“好吧，我要毁了他的计划。”

她不会让接下来的星期天像之前那样度过了。感谢上帝，汤姆是个势利的人。“一个女人通过她的魅力吸引男人，通过他们的恶习掌控他们。”她喃喃道，想着这是她自己发明的格言，还是她演的某个剧里的台词。

她吩咐仆人打了几个电话。她邀请丹诺伦特夫妇来共度周末。查尔斯·泰默利正在亨利镇，也接受了星期天的邀请，并会带着他的主人——财政大臣梅休·布赖恩斯顿爵士——一同前来。为了让他和丹诺伦特夫妇开心——因为她知道上层阶级的人们不喜欢在他们认为是波希米亚式的圈子里彼此相遇，却喜欢遇到各种各样的艺术家——她特地邀请了跟她搭档做男主角的阿尔奇·德克斯特和他美丽的妻子，阿尔奇的妻子用婚前的姓名格雷斯·哈德威尔做艺名。她非常确定，会有一对侯爵夫妇在周围徘徊，还有一位内阁大臣让人印象深刻，汤姆不会跟罗杰去打高尔夫或者在赛艇里待一下午。在这样的宴会上，罗杰会默默地守着一个学校男生的本分，没有人会注意到他，而汤姆会看到她是多么的光芒四射。心里期盼胜利到来的日子里，她咬紧牙关竭力忍受。她很少看到罗杰和汤姆。在有日场演出的日子，她根本见不到他们的面。他们如果不玩什么体育游戏，就开着罗杰的汽车在乡野间乱兜。

戏剧结束后朱莉娅载着丹诺伦特夫妇来到乡下。罗杰已经上床休息了，但迈克尔和汤姆还在等着和他们一起吃晚餐。那是一顿不错的晚餐。仆人们也已经休息了，他们自己动起手来。朱莉娅注意到汤姆害羞又热切地确保丹诺伦特夫妇的所有要求得到满足，还注意到当他能有所效劳时急忙跃起的殷勤劲儿。他殷勤得有点用力过猛。丹诺伦特夫妇是一对没什么架子的年轻人，他们从未想过他们的头衔会让人觉得有什么了不起，当汤姆拿走他用过的盘子并递给他一个新盘子，让他好继续吃下一道菜时，乔治·丹诺伦特显得有些尴尬。

“罗杰明天不会打高尔夫了，我觉得。”朱莉娅对自己说。

他们一直说说笑笑到凌晨三点，当汤姆对她说晚安时，他眼里闪烁着光芒；但是因为爱还是香槟，那她就不清楚了。他紧紧握了一下她的手。

“真是个令人愉快的聚会。”他说道。

朱莉娅下楼走进花园时，时间已经不早了，她穿着一件蝉翼纱的衣裳，特别漂亮，她看见罗杰坐在长椅上，手里拿着一本书。

“在读书？”她说道，扬起她那着实漂亮的眉毛，“为什么不去打高尔夫了？”

罗杰看起来有点闷闷不乐。

“汤姆说太热了。”

“哦？”她迷人地笑了，“我还担心你在想你应该留下来照顾我的客人们。这儿会来很多人，没有你我们也能轻松地招呼他们。其他人呢？”

“不知道。汤姆正和塞西莉·丹诺伦特在那儿装模作样呢。”

“她很漂亮，你知道。”

“在我看来，今天将会无聊透顶。”

“我希望汤姆不会这么觉得。”她说道，好像她真的很担心。

罗杰没有说话。

这一天过得真如她所希望的那样。她确实也没怎么见到汤姆，但是罗杰见得更少。汤姆在丹诺伦特夫妇那里大受欢迎；他向他们解释如何避免支付那么多的所得税。他恭敬地听财政大臣讲舞台艺术，听阿尔奇·德克斯特分析政治形势。朱莉娅状态极佳。阿尔奇·德克斯特脑子很灵活，不仅肚子里有一堆剧院的故事，而且还能把它们讲得出神入化。他们俩让一桌宾客午餐期间开怀大笑。下午茶后，大家打网球打累了，一定要让朱莉娅（也并非违背她的意愿）模仿格拉迪斯·库珀、康斯坦斯·科利尔和格蒂·劳伦斯的表演。但朱莉娅并没有忘记查尔斯·泰默利是她最忠诚的、没有获得报答的情人，因此她特意和他在黄昏中散了一会儿步。跟他在一起，她既不需要嘻嘻哈哈也不需要才华横溢，她很温柔沉静。虽然白天的时候她的表现让人觉得才华横溢，但此刻她的心在痛；她叹着气，神情哀伤，断断续续的话语真诚地使他明白，虽然她的职业生涯屡屡成功，但她的生活却空洞乏味，她不禁觉得自己错过了什么。有时她会想到那不勒斯湾索伦多的别墅。一个美丽的梦。也许如果她开口，她就会拥有幸福；她一直都是个傻子；舞台上的成功说到底不就是一种幻影？丑角们。人们从未意识到那部戏剧有多真实；总是“把戏演下去”(1)那一套之类的。她极度寂寞。当然，她无须告诉查尔斯她心痛并非因为失去的机会，而是因为一个年轻人喜欢和她儿子打高尔夫胜过和她做爱。

但是后来，朱莉娅和阿尔奇·德克斯特待在一起。晚餐后，他们全都坐在客厅里，他们两人没有事先跟大家打招呼，就开始随便交谈着，突然吵起架来，就好像他们是一对情侣在争风吃醋。一时间，大家都没有意识到这是个笑话，直到他们相互的指责变得越来越过分，大家才知道上当受骗了，众人大笑起来。之后，他们即兴表演一个喝醉了酒的绅士在杰明街上勾搭一名法国妓女的场面。在这之后，正当那一小撮观众哄堂大笑之际，他们又严肃认真地演出了《群鬼》中阿尔文太太企图勾引曼德斯牧师的那场戏。最后，为了彰显戏剧效果，他们表演了过去在戏剧界聚会上经常演出的节目。这虽是一部英文版的契诃夫的戏剧，但情绪激动之处，听起来倒像是俄语版的。朱莉娅动用了她所有演悲剧的天赋，但又强调它的闹剧性质，因此妙趣横生。她把心里真正的苦痛倾注在戏里，而又以生动的诙谐感予以嘲弄。观众们在座位上前仰后合，捧腹大笑，以至于笑得痛苦地呻吟起来。或许朱莉娅从来没有演得这样精彩过。她是在演给汤姆看，演给他一个人看。

“我看见了伯恩哈特和雷耶纳。”财政大臣说道，“我见到了杜丝、爱伦·泰瑞和肯德尔夫人。死而无憾。(2)”

朱莉娅，光芒四射，身子后仰陷入椅子里，大口喝干了一杯香槟。

“如果我没有坏了罗杰的计策，我就把名字倒着写。”她心里想道。

即便这样，当朱莉娅第二天一早下楼时，发现那两个小伙子已经去打高尔夫了。迈克尔开车送丹诺伦特夫妇回伦敦。朱莉娅很疲惫。当汤姆和罗杰回来吃午餐时，她费劲地表现出很开心健谈的样子。下午，他们三人到河里划船，但朱莉娅觉得，他们带着她并不是因为想要如此，而是他们不得不这么做。想起她是如何期盼汤姆的假期时，她忍住没让自己叹气。现在她正计算着假期还剩多久。当她坐进去伦敦的车里时，她深吸一口气。她并没有生汤姆的气，而是被深深地伤害了；她气她自己，因为她对自己的情感完全失去了控制。但当她回到剧场，她感觉自己如同从噩梦中醒来一般摆脱了对他的痴迷；在她的更衣室里，她重新掌控了自己，日常生活的琐事变得不值一提。当自由触手可及时，一切都不重要了。

这周就这样过去了。迈克尔、罗杰和汤姆都过得不错。他们游泳，打网球，打高尔夫，在河里漂流。假期还有四天就结束了。假期还有仅仅三天就结束了。

（“我现在能坚持了。等回到伦敦一切就会不同。我不能显示出我有多难过。我必须假装一切正常。”）

“我们真是捡到便宜了，竟有这么好的天气。”迈克尔说道，“汤姆真是来对了，不是吗？可惜他不能再待一周。”

“是啊，真的太可惜了。”

“我觉得他对罗杰来说是个不错的朋友。一个完全正常的、心地纯洁的英国男孩。”

“哦，完全是这样。”（“大笨蛋，大笨蛋。”）

“他们吃饭的样子让人十分愉快。”

“是的，他们看起来很享受自己的食物。”（“上帝，我希望他们能被噎死。”）

汤姆星期一早晨会乘早班火车回伦敦。德克斯特夫妇在伯恩头镇有座房子，并邀请他们星期天一起吃午餐。他们将一起乘汽艇去。既然汤姆的假期快要结束了，朱莉娅很高兴她连眉头都没有皱一下，从而流露她心中的愤怒。她很确定，汤姆不知道他深深地伤害了她。到头来她必须要宽容大度，他还只是个孩子，而且如果你真要仔细算起来，她都可以做他的妈妈了。她对他的感情本来就是荒唐的，但现在既然已经产生了，她情不自禁；她从一开始就告诉自己，她不能让他感觉到她对他有什么要求。星期天晚上没有别人来吃晚餐。她想在最后一晚上能单独和他在一起；虽然这是不可能的，但他们可以单独在花园里散会儿步。

“我在想他是否注意到，自他来到这里就没有吻过我？”

他们可以去划船。要是能在他怀里待几分钟就太美了，那样能弥补所有这一切。

德克斯特夫妇的聚会很戏剧化。阿尔奇·德克斯特的妻子格雷斯·哈德威尔在演音乐喜剧，还有一群在她当时参加演出的戏里跳舞的漂亮姑娘，朱莉娅非常自然地出演了一个没有架子的头牌女演员的角色。她对这些在歌舞班中白金色头发被烫成波浪形、只拿三英镑周薪的年轻姑娘显得很亲切。很多客人带来了柯达相机，她友好地和他们拍照。当格雷斯·哈德威尔在作曲家的伴奏下唱着自己那著名的歌曲时，她报以热烈的掌声。当那个逗趣的女人模仿她最出名的角色，她跟其他人一样开怀大笑。一切都欢快喧闹，轻松快活。朱莉娅自己也很享受，但到七点的时候，她不想再待下去了。当她正在感谢两位宴会主人的热情款待时，罗杰来到她身边。

“我说，妈妈，有一群人要去梅登海德吃饭跳舞，他们想让我和汤姆同去。你不介意的，对吧？”

此刻，热血冲向了面颊，她的脸红扑扑的。她禁不住厉声问道：

“那你们打算怎么回来？”

“哦，没关系，我们会让人载我们回去。”

她无助地看着他，不知道该说什么。

“一定会开心极了。汤姆非常想去。”

她的心沉了下来。她费了极大的劲儿才没有发脾气。她控制住了自己。

“好吧，亲爱的。不要玩得太晚。记住汤姆明早还要早起。”

汤姆已经走了过来，听到了最后这句话。

“你确定你不介意？”他问道。

“当然不。我希望你玩得开心。”

她笑靥如花地望着他，但眼睛中却是深深的恨意。

“我也很高兴这俩孩子走了，”当他们返回汽艇时迈克尔说道，“我们很久都没有过一个属于我们俩的夜晚了。”

她紧紧攥着拳头，阻止自己告诉他闭上他的蠢嘴。她恼羞成怒。这是压垮她的最后一根稻草。汤姆已经忽视了她两周，他对她甚至没有起码的礼节，而她却一直如天使一般。世界上没有任何女人会像她一样展示出如此耐心。换任何别的女人，早就会跟他讲，如果他不懂基本的社交礼仪，最好赶紧离开。自私，愚蠢，平庸，他就是这样的人。她甚至希望他不是明天就离开，这样她便可以享受将他的行李扔出门外的乐子。一个微不足道的小人物竟敢如此对待她；诗人、内阁大臣和世袭贵族都会为了和她共餐的机会而放弃最重要的约会，而他为了和一群头发漂白成金色不懂演戏的蠢货跳舞把她扔在一边。这足以说明他有多愚蠢。你还以为他会心存感激。不应该吗？他穿的这身西服就是她付的钱。还有他那引以为傲的烟盒，难道不是她给他的吗？还有他戴的那戒指。我的天，她得跟他扯平了。没错，而且她知道她该怎么做。她知道他最敏感的地方，知道如何做才能最残忍地伤到他。那样会戳到他的痛处。当她在脑子里反复想着这计谋时，她感到一点安慰。她迫不及待地要执行此计，一到家便径直回了房间。她从包里拿出四个一英镑和十便士，然后写了一封简短的信。

亲爱的汤姆：

因明天早晨就见不到你了，特送些钱供你打赏使用。给管家三镑，给为你洗衣服的女仆一镑，给司机十便士。

朱莉娅

她喊来伊维，告诉她这封信应该由喊汤姆起床的女仆递给他。当她下楼吃晚餐时，她感到舒服多了。吃饭期间，她和迈克尔聊得有声有色，之后，他们玩了会儿伯齐克纸牌。即使她绞尽脑汁想一礼拜，也想不出比这更能羞辱汤姆的事情了。

但当她躺到床上后却无法入睡。她在等罗杰和汤姆回来。有个念头让她坐立不安。或许汤姆会意识到他的行为很糟糕，如果他仔细想一想，他肯定能看出他让她多不开心；他可能会感到抱歉，当他回来后，跟罗杰说晚安后，会悄悄来到她屋里。如果他这么做，她会原谅他的一切。那封信可能还在管家的储藏室里；她能轻易地溜下去把它取回来。终于来了一辆车。她打开灯看了看时间，三点了。她听到两个年轻人上楼，各自回了房间。她等着。她一直开着床头灯，这样他开门时能看清楚。她会假装她睡着了，当他惦着脚尖走过来，她会慢慢睁开眼，冲他笑笑。她等待着。在安静的夜晚，她听到他上了床，熄了灯。她目视前方一会，耸了一下肩，打开她床头的抽屉，从一个小瓶中取出两三片安眠药。

“如果我再不睡觉，我就要疯了。”

第十五章


朱莉娅直到十一点才醒来。在她的信中夹着一封没有邮票的信。她认出汤姆干净得像商务文书一样的字迹，把信拆了开来。信封里有四英镑和十便士。她感到有点不适。她并不知道自己希望他怎么回复那封傲慢得让人感到屈辱的信。她没想过他会回复。她感到困扰，她本想就是伤一伤他的感情，但现在她担心自己做得有点过了。

“不管怎样，我希望他付了仆人们小费。”她咕哝着让自己安心。之后，她耸耸肩膀，“他会回心转意的。让他知道我并不是一直都那么甜美对他没坏处。”

但是，她一整天都是若有所思的样子。当她到达剧院时，一个包裹正等着她。她一看包裹上的地址，就知道里面是什么。伊维问她是否要打开。

“不用。”

但当她独自一人时，她立刻打开了包裹。里面有袖扣、马甲纽扣、珍珠饰纽、腕表和汤姆引以为荣的烟盒。没有一句解释。她的心沉了下来，她意识到自己在发抖。

“我真是个该死的傻瓜！为什么我不收敛我的脾气？”

她的心脏痛苦地跳动着。她无法怀着如此痛苦的心情上台演出，她会演得非常糟糕；无论如何她都必须跟他谈一谈。他住的那栋房子里有部电话，在他的房间里设有分机。她给他打了电话。幸运的是他在家。

“汤姆。”

“是？”

回答前他沉默了一会儿，他的声音里充满了不耐烦。

“这是什么意思？为什么你把这些东西都送回来了？”

“你今早收到那些钱了吗？”

“是的。我完全搞不懂是怎么回事。我冒犯到你了吗？”

“哦，没有，”他回答道，“我喜欢被当成一个男宠对待。我喜欢钱被人丢在脸上的感觉，连我的小费都要别人给我。我觉得你没有给我回伦敦的三等座火车票的票钱很奇怪。”

虽然朱莉娅目前正处在令人可怜的焦虑中，她连话都说不出口，但听到他笨拙的讽刺，几乎笑了出来。他真是个小傻子。

“但你不会觉得我想要故意伤害你吧。以你对我的了解，你肯定知道，那是我绝对不会做的事情。”

“那就更糟糕了。”（“该死。”朱莉娅心里想。）“我从来不该让你送我那些礼物。我压根不该让你借我那些钱。”

“我不知道你在说什么。肯定有什么可怕的误会。今晚演出结束后来接我吧，我们讲清楚。我肯定能解释明白。”

“我今晚跟我家人去吃晚饭，会睡在家里。”

“那明天吧。”

“明天我也有事。”

“我必须见你，汤姆。凭我们的交情，不能就这样分手。你不能不听我解释就指责我。为我根本没有犯过的错而惩罚我，这太不公平了。”

“我觉得我们不见面会更好。”

朱莉娅感到越来越绝望。

“但我爱你，汤姆。我爱你。让我再见你一次，如果你还生我的气，那我们也只好就此结束。”

电话那端是一阵长久的沉默。

“好吧。周三日场演出结束后我会过来。”

“不要把我想成没心肝的人，汤姆。”

她挂了电话。不管怎么样，他还是要来的。她收起他还给她的这些东西，并把它们藏到确保伊维看不到的地方。她脱了衣服，穿上她粉色的旧晨衣，开始化妆。她心情不好：这是她第一次告诉他她爱他。她不得不受到这样的侮辱，求他来看她，这让她恼怒不已。在这以前，总是他主动要求她来做伴的。想到现在他们之间的位置已公然颠倒过来了，她心中怏怏不乐。

周三朱莉娅的日场演出很糟糕。热浪影响营业，场内气氛冷淡。朱莉娅对此漠不关心。惶恐不安的情绪折磨着她的心，她顾不上考虑戏演得怎么样了。（“他们究竟干吗要在这样的日子来剧院看戏呢？”）等戏演完了，她感到高兴。

“我在等芬内尔先生，”她告诉伊维，“我跟他见面时不想被人打扰。”

伊维没有回答。朱莉娅看了她一眼，只见她看起来神情冷酷。

（“让她见鬼去吧。我才不管她在想什么！”）

他现在应该已经到了。已经过了五点。他一定会来；毕竟，他承诺了，不是吗？她穿上一件晨衣，不是她化妆时穿的那件，而是一件杏色的男式丝绸晨衣。伊维没完没了地在那儿整理东西。

“看在上帝的分上，别小题大做了，伊维。让我独自待会。”

伊维没有说话。她一丝不苟地按照朱莉娅的要求继续按部就班地整理梳妆台上的物品。

“该死，我对你说话呢，你干吗不回答？”

伊维转过身，看着她。她若有所思地挠了挠鼻孔。

“您可能是位伟大的女演员……”

“从这里滚出去。”

卸了舞台妆后，朱莉娅没有再涂脂抹粉，除了遮挡了一下她轻微的黑眼圈。她皮肤光滑白皙，但没有脸蛋儿上的胭脂和嘴唇上的口红，她面容憔悴。她身上的男式晨衣让她显得无助、脆弱又潇洒。她的心脏跳得让她难受，她非常焦虑，可是照着镜子她却喃喃自语地说：《艺术家的生涯》中最后一幕里的咪咪。几乎是下意识的，她像得了肺病一样咳嗽了一两声。她关掉了梳妆台上雪亮的台灯，在沙发上躺了一会儿。此刻响起了敲门声，伊维通报芬纳尔先生来了。朱莉娅伸出了一只白皙纤细的手。

“我躺一会儿。恐怕我身体不太舒服。你自己找把椅子坐。你能来真是太好了。”

“很抱歉。你怎么了？”

“哦，没什么。”她努力用苍白的嘴唇笑了笑，“过去这两三个晚上我睡得不太好。”

她把一双美丽的眼睛转向他，沉默地盯着他看了一会儿。他的脸阴沉沉的，但她看出他很害怕。

“我在等你告诉我你对我有什么不满意。”最终她声音低沉地说。

她注意到那声音有点颤抖，但很自然。（“上帝，我相信我也很害怕。”）

“回头重谈那个没什么意义了。我唯一要告诉你的就是：我恐怕无法立刻还给你我欠的那两百英镑，我没有那么多钱，但我会一点一点还给你。我讨厌让你容我些时间，但我也没办法。”

她从沙发上坐了起来，双手贴到她那碎了的心上。

“我不明白。我两个晚上都没有睡觉，翻来覆去想这件事情。我以为我要疯了。我一直都在试图理解，但我无法明白，做不到。”

（“这是我在哪个剧里说的台词？”）

“哦，是的，你可以，你非常明白。你在生我的气，你想要报复我。而且你也这么做了。你报复得太准了。你再明白不过地表达了对我的蔑视。”

“但我为什么要报复你？为什么要生你的气？”

“因为我和罗杰去了梅登海德的那个聚会，而你希望我回家。”

“但我告诉你去吧。我说了我希望你过得愉快。”

“我知道你说了，但你的眼睛闪烁着怒火。我不想去，但罗杰非常想去。我告诉他我觉得我们应该回去，与你和迈克尔吃晚餐，但他说你会很乐意我们离开，我不想就此小题大做。等我看到你怒气冲天的时候，回头已经来不及了。”

“我没有生气。我不知道你脑子里为什么有这样的想法。你当然应该去那个聚会。你不会认为我会坏到不肯让你在你两周的假期里寻点乐子吧。我可怜的小乖乖，我唯一担心的就是你会感到无聊。我太想让你过得开心了。”

“那你为什么给我送来那些钱，写那封信？太侮辱人了。”

朱莉娅的声音在发抖。她的下巴开始颤抖，她的肌肉不听使唤的样子令人莫名地感动。汤姆不自在地移开了视线。

“一想到你把你辛苦挣的钱浪费在小费上，我就无法忍受。我知道你并不富有，而且高尔夫球场的场地费肯定花了你不少钱。我讨厌那些和年轻男人们约会并让他们支付一切的女人。这样做太不顾及别人了。我对待你就如同对待罗杰一样。我从未想过那么做会伤了你的自尊。”

“你愿意发誓吗？”

“当然愿意。我的上帝，这么几个月的相处后，难道你还如此不了解我吗？如果你所认为的是真的，那我应该是一个多么残酷卑鄙的女人，一个多么无情下流低俗的禽兽！我在你心里就是这样的吗？”

一个无法回答的问题。

“不管怎样都不重要了。我不应该接受你那些昂贵的礼物，还让你借钱给我。这让我陷入糟糕的处境。我之所以认为你轻视我，是因为我觉得你有权利轻视我。事实是我没有钱去跟那些比我富有那么多的人交往。我真蠢，还以为能这样做。这段时间很有趣，我过了一段精彩的时光，可到现在结束了，我不打算继续见你了。”

她深深地叹了口气。

“你一点都不在乎我。这才是你的意思。”

“你这么说可不公平。”

“你是我的一切。你知道这点。我很孤独，与你的友情对我来说意义重大。我周围都是一群蹭吃蹭喝的寄生虫，而我知道你并不图我什么。我觉得我可以依靠你。我特别喜欢和你待在一起。你是这世界上唯一一个与我相处时，我可以完全做自己的人。你不知道能帮得上你一点忙会让我多开心吗？我送那些小礼物并不是为了你，而是为了我自己；看到你使用我给你的那些东西让我非常开心。如果你对我有一点爱怜之心的话，这些礼物就不会使你感到羞辱，你会因为欠我的情而受到感动。”

她再一次把眼睛转向他。她总是能很轻易地哭出来，而现在她又这么难过，哭对她而言根本无须费劲。他从来没有见过她哭。她能泣而不啜，张着她那双美丽的黑色眼睛，脸有些僵硬。硕大而沉重的泪滴流了下来。而她的沉默、她那一动不动的悲痛的身体，极为感人。自从演完《创伤的心》之后，她就再没有哭得那样厉害。上帝，那部剧简直让她心力交瘁。她并没有看着汤姆，她眼睛直瞪瞪地注视前方；她确实悲伤得有些神情恍惚，但又怎么样呢？她体内另外一个自我知道她在做什么，这个自我感知她的不幸，同时又观察它的表现。她感到他面色变得苍白。她感到突然有一阵痛苦绞着他的心弦，她感到他的血肉之躯无法承受她那极度的痛苦。

“朱莉娅。”

他的声音沙哑。她慢慢地将湿漉漉的眼睛转向了他。他看到的并不是一个哭泣的女人，而是整个人类的不幸，是人类命运无法测量的、极度悲伤的痛苦欲绝。他跪在她面前，将她抱在怀里。他感到心烦意乱。

“我最亲爱的，最亲爱的。”

有一会儿，她一动不动。就好像她不知道他在那儿。他亲吻她流着眼泪的眼睛，他的嘴向她的嘴上凑过去。她把嘴给了他，好像她毫无力气，好像她对发生在自己身上的一切几乎都毫无意识，似乎她已经没有了意志。她用一个几乎察觉不到的动作将自己的身体靠向他，渐渐地用双手搂住了他的脖子。她躺在他的怀里，并非呆滞，而是好像她失去了所有的力量和活力。他尝到了她眼泪的咸味。最终，她疲惫不堪，两只柔软的手臂紧紧抓着他，躺回到沙发上。他的嘴唇紧贴着她的。

如果你在一刻钟后看到她如此欢快愉悦，脸上泛着红晕，你一定想不到，不久前她刚刚经历了一场暴风雨般的哭泣。他们各喝了一杯威士忌苏打，抽了一根烟，看着彼此，眼中充满喜爱。

“他是个可爱的小东西。”她想。

她突然想到应该好好款待一下他。

“里卡比公爵和公爵夫人今晚会来剧院，我们会一起去萨沃伊饭店吃晚餐。我想你不会来的，是吧？我特别希望有个男伴，凑成四个人。”

“如果你希望我去，我当然会去。”

他脸上凸显的红晕告诉她见到这样显贵的人对他来说是多么兴奋的一件事。她并没有告诉他里卡比夫妇只要有免费的饭吃，哪里都愿意去。虽然很是害羞，但汤姆还是收回了他退还给朱莉娅的那些礼物。当他离开后，朱莉娅坐在化妆镜前，好好地审视了一番自己。

“我真是太幸运了，不用担心哭泣会肿眼睛。”她说道。她按摩了一阵眼皮，“男人都是一群大傻瓜。”

她很开心。一切都没问题了。她又重新得到了他。不过，在她脑海后面或者内心深处萌生了对汤姆的一些鄙夷，因为他是一个这么无知的蠢货。





第十六章


他们的这次争吵，以某种奇妙的方式消除了他们之间的隔阂，让两人关系更加密切。当她再次提出公寓的问题时，汤姆并没有像她预想中的那样抵触。在他和朱莉娅重新复合，拿回她的礼物并同意忘记那借款后，汤姆看起来似乎已经将自己道德上的顾虑都置于一边了。他们一起开心地装修公寓。司机的老婆替他打扫屋子并为他做早餐。朱莉娅有一把公寓钥匙，有时会自己进去，独自坐在那小小的客厅里，等他从办公室回来。他们一周在外共进两到三次晚餐并且跳舞，然后坐出租车回到公寓。朱莉娅过了一个愉快的秋天。他们上演的戏剧很成功。她感到灵动而年轻。罗杰圣诞节的时候回到家中，但只待了两周，然后就去了维也纳。朱莉娅预计他会霸占汤姆，她决定不去计较。年轻人自然会和年轻人相互吸引，她告诉自己，如果有那么几天他们两个形影不离，以至于汤姆忽略了她的存在，这也没什么值得她焦虑的。她现在拥有他。能成为她的情人，他感到很骄傲，这给了他不少自信，而且他很高兴和一大群知名人士有不错的交情，虽然他都是通过朱莉娅认识的这些人。他现在非常渴望加入一个上层俱乐部，朱莉娅目前正在帮他找门路。查尔斯从未拒绝过朱莉娅，她很肯定，用点伎俩她一定能够哄骗他提议让汤姆加入他所属的那个俱乐部。对于汤姆来说，有钱花是一件新奇又愉快的体验；她鼓励他奢侈一点；她明白，他会习惯这种生活方式，然后意识到他无法离开她了。

“当然这一切不会长久，”她告诉她自己，“但到头来，对他来讲这是一次很棒的经历。这会让他成为真正的男子汉。”

然而，虽然她自己认为这关系不会长久，但她并不真正明白其中的理由。随着时间消逝，他渐渐变老，他们之间不会有特别的不同。再过十年或十五年，他不再如此年轻，而她还会像现在这般年纪。他们在一起相处得很舒服。男人是习惯性的动物；这让女人能牢牢地控制他们。她从未感到比他年纪大，同时她也确信他从未想过他们年龄之间的差异。对此有那么一阵子她的确感到不安。她正躺在他的床上。他站在梳妆台旁，穿着衬衫，梳他的头发。她全身赤裸，以提香笔下的维纳斯那样的姿势躺在那里，她记得到一所乡间别墅做客时看到过这幅画。她觉得自己摆出了一副可爱的画面，完全意识到自己所展现的美丽动人的形象，便保持着这个姿势。她开心而满足。

“这就是浪漫。”她想，嘴角挂着一抹浅浅的微笑。

他在镜子里看到了她，转过身，没说一句话，抽起被单遮住了她的身体。虽然她充满爱意地朝他微笑，但还是让她心里一惊。他是害怕她着凉吗？还是他那英国人的腼腆个性被她的裸体吓到？又或者，在他男孩子的欲望得到满足后，看到她衰老的身体让他有点恶心？当朱莉娅回家后，她再次脱掉所有的衣服，在穿衣镜前审视了自己。朱莉娅决定对自己不留情面。她观察她的脖子，那里没有一点岁月的痕迹，尤其是当她把脸抬起来的时候；她的乳房小而坚实，说是女孩子的乳房都不为过。她的小腹扁平，臀部小巧，那儿有一些肥肉，像一根长香肠，但所有人都有，不过菲利普斯小姐可以在那儿用用力气了。没人会说她的双腿不漂亮，她的腿纤长而美丽；她用双手抚摸着自己的全身，她的皮肤如同天鹅绒一般柔软，白皙且没有一颗黑痣。当然，她眼睛下面有一些细纹，但你得仔细盯着看才能发现；据说有种手术可以让人摆脱这些细纹，或许可以去打听一下；幸运的是，她的头发没有褪色，因为不管染得怎样好，都会让脸看起来僵硬；她的头发依旧是鲜明的深棕色。她的牙齿保养得也非常好。

“假正经，就是这样。”

一瞬间她回忆起火车上那个蓄胡子的西班牙人，顽皮地对着镜子里的自己笑笑。

“他可一点都不害臊。”

不过尽管如此，从那天起，她开始小心自己的行为举止，以按照汤姆的体面标准行事。

朱莉娅的名声非常好，她觉得自己没有必要犹豫是否应该和汤姆一起出现在公众场合。对她来说去夜总会是一种新体验，她很喜欢，虽然她比任何人都清楚不论她去哪里都会被注视，但她却从未想过她这些习惯上的变化会引起公众的议论。在对婚姻忠贞二十年后，当然她没有把西班牙人的事情算作数，任何意外都可能发生在一个女人身上。朱莉娅很自信，认为没有人会怀疑她跟一个小到可以当她儿子的年轻人有私情。她从未想过，汤姆可能并没有她想象中的那么小心谨慎，也从未想过他们一起跳舞时她的眼神会背叛她。她自视享有特权，所以从没想到人们最终开始沸沸扬扬地说起闲话。

当流言传到多莉·德·弗里斯的耳朵中时，她笑了。应朱莉娅的要求，她邀请汤姆参加各种聚会，还有一两次邀请他来乡下的别墅度周末，但她从未把汤姆放在心上。他看起来是个不错的小家伙，当迈克尔忙碌时还可以做朱莉娅的陪同，但微不足道。他是那种不论在哪里经过都引不起注意的人，甚至在跟他见过面后依然想不起他长什么样子。他就是为了让参加聚会的人数变成双数才会去邀请的那种人。朱莉娅会开心地称他为“我的男孩朋友”或者“我的年轻男人”；如果他们之间真有什么私情，她不可能对此表现得如此镇静坦诚。而且，多莉非常清楚，朱莉娅的生活中只有两个男人，迈克尔和查尔斯·泰默利。但同时又觉得朱莉娅可笑，在这么多年的洁身自好后，突然开始一周去三四次夜总会。最近多莉没怎么见到她，她的无视有点伤到多莉的自尊。多莉在戏剧界有很多朋友，于是开始打探。对于她听到的一切，她一点也开心不起来。她不知道对此该做何感想。有件事情是很确定的，朱莉娅并不知道人们在她背后都议论什么，必须得有人告诉她。不能是她，她没有这个勇气。即使是在这么多年的交情后，她还是有点害怕朱莉娅。朱莉娅是个脾气很好的女人，虽然她的语言经常显得唐突，但她很难被惹怒。可她有种气质不允许你跟她胡来，你会觉得如果跟她闹得太大你会为此感到后悔。但必须得做些什么。多莉在脑子里翻来覆去地将此事思虑了两个礼拜，忧心忡忡；她试图将自己受伤的情感暂且先搁置在一边，完全从朱莉娅的演艺事业出发，最后她得出结论，得让迈克尔跟她讲。她从来没喜欢过迈克尔，但他毕竟是朱莉娅的丈夫，她有义务告诉迈克尔，让他给正在发生的这一切画上句号。

于是，多莉打电话给迈克尔，并约他在剧院见面。迈克尔对多莉就像她对他一样，也没有任何好感，虽然是由于另外的原因，当他听到她想见他的时候，迈克尔不由得诅咒了一声。他很懊恼无法让多莉出售她的那部分股份，还憎恨她给出的一切建议，他认为那是横加干涉。但当多莉出现在他的办公室时，他还是友好地问候了她，亲吻了她的脸颊。

“请坐，别客气。来这儿是不是为了看看这个老剧院是否还在给你挣红利？”

多莉·德·弗里斯已经六十岁了。她很胖，大鼻子和厚厚的红嘴唇使她的脸看起来硕大无比。她的黑绸连衣裙有一丝男性风格，但她脖子上戴了一串双圈珍珠项链，腰部和帽子上分别戴了一个钻石胸针。她的短发染成鲜明的铜黄色，嘴唇和指甲涂得火红。她的声音洪亮低沉，但当她激动时，说出的字眼会叠加听不清，并暴露出一丝伦敦底层人的口音。

“迈克尔，我为朱莉娅的事情感到心烦意乱。”

迈克尔，这个完美的绅士，稍稍挑起眉毛，紧闭着他那薄薄的嘴唇。他可不打算跟多莉谈论自己的妻子。

“我觉得她最近做得实在有点过分。我不知道什么冲昏了她的脑子。她现在去的那些聚会、那些夜总会还有其他的事情。毕竟，她不再是个年轻女人了；她会把自己耗尽的。”

“哦，一派胡言。她强壮得跟头牛一样，她非常健康。她比前几年显得还要年轻。别看她做完一天的工作去找点乐子就嫉妒她。现在她演的角色并不费力，我很开心她能出去玩一玩。这仅仅说明她多么有活力。”

“她从来没有对那种事情感兴趣过。突然间，她就开始去那种氛围糟糕的地方跳舞到深夜两点，这太奇怪了。”

“那是她唯一的运动。她可不会穿上短裤跟我去公园里跑步。”

“我觉得你应该知道人们都在说些什么。这些言论对她的名声可不太好。”

“你到底是在说什么？”

“她这种年纪，跟一个那么年轻的男孩，如此引人瞩目地在公共场合出现，这简直太荒谬了。”

迈克尔看着多莉，并没有理解她在说什么，当他明白过来时，他大笑不已。

“汤姆？别犯傻了，多莉。”

“我不是犯傻。我知道我在说什么。像朱莉娅那么出名的人，总是跟一个男人在一起，人们自然会说闲话。”

“但汤姆是我们俩的朋友。你很明白，我没办法带她出去跳舞。我得第二天早上八点起床，在开始工作前去运动。活见鬼，在三十年舞台生涯后，我还是知道一点人性的。汤姆是一个纯朴诚实的英国男孩，他是个绅士。我敢说他爱慕朱莉娅，那个年纪的男孩经常会觉得他们爱上了比自己年纪大的女人，但这不会对他产生什么伤害，只会给他带来好处；但认为朱莉娅会对他有什么想法——我可怜的多莉，你真让我觉得好笑。”

“他无趣、迟钝、普通且还很势利。”

“好吧，如果他是你所说的那种人，而朱莉娅跟他形影不离，这难道不让你觉得奇怪吗？”

“只有女人会知道女人能做什么。”

“这句话不错，多莉。我们可能会请你写下一部戏剧。现在让我们把这个问题解决掉。你能直视我的脸，告诉我，你真的认为朱莉娅和汤姆有私情？”

她直勾勾地看着他的脸，眼睛里充满了痛苦。虽然刚开始当她听到关于朱莉娅的流言时她付之一笑，但她无法抑制住后来侵占了她脑子的疑虑；她记起了很多小事，当时觉得没什么，但现在看来非常可疑。她遭遇了在她看来无法忍受的痛苦。证据？她没有证据；她的直觉告诉她不能不信。她想回答是，这种冲动几乎无法控制；但她还是控制住了。她不能背叛朱莉娅。这个笨蛋可能会告诉朱莉娅，然后朱莉娅就再也不会跟自己说话了。他可能会暗中监视朱莉娅，并抓她的现行。没人能预测如果她说了实话会发生什么。

“不，我不确信。”

她的双眼满是泪水，泪珠顺着她巨大的脸颊流下来。迈克尔看到了她的痛苦。他觉得她很可笑，但他意识到她非常难过，心地善良的他想要给她安慰。

“我确信你并不这么认为。你知道朱莉娅有多喜欢你，如果她有了新朋友，你不能嫉妒，你知道的。”

“上帝知道我并不嫉妒她什么，”她抽泣地说道，“最近她对我变得非常不同。她变得很冷漠。我对她如此忠诚，迈克尔。”

“是的，亲爱的，我知道。”

“如果我把为国王效劳的热诚，用一半来侍奉我的上帝……”

“哦，得了，还没有那么糟糕。你知道，我不是那种会跟别人谈论自己老婆的人。我总是觉得这事儿不成体统。但你知道，老实说，你一点也不了解朱莉娅。性对于她来说什么都不是。我们刚结婚那会儿，一切都不同，我不介意告诉你毕竟那几年她让我的日子也不怎么好过。我并不是说她是一个女色情狂或是类似的什么，但有时她会让人很疲惫。床上生活很好，但生活中还有其他事情。可自打罗杰出生，她完全变了。生孩子让她安定下来。她将所有这些本能都带入要演的戏中。多莉，你读过弗洛伊德；他把这个叫作什么来着？”

“哦，迈克尔，我才不关心什么弗洛伊德。”

“升华。就是这个。我经常会想是什么让她成为如此成功的女演员。演戏是一件需要花费全部时间的工作，如果你想演得好，你必须把自己全部都投入进去。对于那些认为演员们过着放荡不羁的生活的公众我很没有耐心。我们才没有时间做那种荒唐的事情。”

迈克尔说的这些话让多莉非常生气，她恢复了自制。

“不过迈克尔，你和我可能认为朱莉娅跟那个蹩脚小子混在一起没什么。但这对她的名声可不好。毕竟，你们的一大资产就是模范的婚姻生活。所有人都羡慕你们这一点。公众很喜欢把你们当作彼此深爱、亲密和谐的一对儿。”

“我们确实是这样，见鬼。”

多莉渐渐失去耐心。

“但我告诉你，人们在说闲话。你没有那么愚蠢，不会预想不到他们一定会这么说。我的意思是，如果朱莉娅一直就有接二连三的花边新闻，没人会注意，但在她过了这么多年规规矩矩的生活后，突然发生现在这样的事情——所有人自然都会开始说闲话。这对生意影响很坏。”

迈克尔快速地瞥了她一眼，微微地笑了。

“我明白你的意思了，多莉。我知道你说的有一定道理，而且在这种情况下，我觉得你完全有理由说这样的话。当我们刚刚开始经营剧院的时候你对我们非常好，我非常不愿意让你失望。我的解决方法是，我会把你的股份买过来。”

“买我的股份？”

多莉挺直了身子，刚才还愁容不展的脸立刻板了起来。她怒不可遏。迈克尔继续温柔地说道：

“我明白你的意思。如果朱莉娅整夜在外寻欢作乐，一定会反映在她的表演上。很明显。她有一批妙不可言的观众——一批老太太，她们来看我们的日场演出，就因为她们认为她是个那样可爱的好女人。我不介意承认，如果她的行为引起大家关于她不好的闲言碎语，这的确会影响收入。我很了解朱莉娅，她不会让任何人干涉她的行动自由。我是她的丈夫，我必须忍受这一点。可你的位置不一样。如果你乘着这个有利时机退出去的话，我不会责怪你。”

多莉现在警惕起来。她可不愚蠢，在商业方面她跟迈克尔棋逢对手。她生气极了，但愤怒让她自制。

“凭着这么多年的交情，我以为，迈克尔，你会更懂我一些。我觉得，出于义务，我必须让你警惕，但同时我也会跟你们共浮沉。我不是那种弃沉船而逃的女人。我敢说，比起你，我更输得起我的那部分钱。”

看到迈克尔脸上清晰显现出的失望让她心满意足。她晓得他对金钱看得很重，希望她刚才说的话使他心痛。迈克尔很快就镇定下来。

“好吧，多莉，那么你再想想。”

多莉拎起包，两人说着友善的客套话分了手。

“愚蠢的老婊子。”当门在多莉身后关上的那一刻，迈克尔说道。

“自负的老蠢驴。”多莉乘坐电梯下楼，嘘声说道。

但当多莉进入她那非常昂贵的豪华汽车，开回蒙塔古广场时，她再也无法抑制住满眶的沉重痛苦的眼泪。她感到自己老了，孤独寂寞，郁郁寡欢，妒火中烧。





第十七章


迈克尔自己觉得富有幽默感。在他和多莉谈话后的那个星期天晚上，他漫步到朱莉娅的房间，朱莉娅正在梳妆打扮。他们准备提早吃晚餐，之后去看电影。

“除了查尔斯，今晚谁还来？”他问她。

“我找不到另外一个女伴了，我喊了汤姆。”

“好！我想见见他。”

想到肚子里藏着的笑话，他忍不住笑了出来。朱莉娅很期待这个夜晚。在电影院的时候，朱莉娅会安排汤姆坐在她身边，这样当她低声和查尔斯说话的时候汤姆会握着她的手。亲爱的查尔斯，承蒙他的爱慕如此长久深情；她会对他格外亲切一些。查尔斯和汤姆同时抵达。汤姆第一次穿着他的新晚礼服，他和朱莉娅暗暗互换了一个小小的眼神，他表示满意，她表示问候。

“嘿，年轻人，”迈克尔欢快地说道，搓着双手，“你知道我听到关于你的什么消息吗？我听说你在败坏我妻子的名声。”

汤姆吃惊地望了他一眼，脸涨得通红。脸红的习惯让他难堪，但他却改不掉。

“哦，亲爱的，”朱莉娅开心地喊道，“太好了！我这一生都在努力找人来败坏我的名声。谁告诉你的，迈克尔？”

“一只小鸟。”他调皮地说道。

“那么，汤姆，如果迈克尔跟我离婚，你可得娶我，你知道吧。”

查尔斯微微笑着，眼中满是忧伤的柔情。

“你都做了什么，汤姆？”他问道。

这年轻人明显的窘态使查尔斯感到心情沉重，迈克尔则兴高采烈。朱莉娅看起来同他们一样觉得有趣，实际上她保持着警觉，小心谨慎。

“很明显，这小子在朱莉娅应该上床睡觉的时候带着她去逛夜总会了。”

朱莉娅开心地叫起来。

“汤姆，我们应该否认呢，还是应该厚着脸皮挺下去？”

“那让我告诉你们我是怎么跟那只小鸟说的吧，”迈克尔插话进来，“我告诉她，只要朱莉娅不拉着我陪她去夜总会就行了……”

朱莉娅不再听他说什么了。“多莉。”她想，奇妙的是，她用来形容多莉的词和前几天迈克尔用的一模一样。晚饭准备好了，他们愉快的谈话转移到了别的话题。虽然朱莉娅开心地参与其中，虽然看起来她把全部精力都放在了她的客人身上，甚至还津津有味地听了已经听过二十遍的迈克尔有关戏剧界的故事之一，但在她内心，她跟多莉正进行一场生动的对话。多莉蜷缩在她面前，她直言不讳地告诉多莉她对她的看法。

“你这头老母牛，”她对多莉说，“你怎么敢掺和我的私事？不，不许说话。不要试图找借口。我知道你跟迈克尔说了什么。无法原谅。我以为你是我的朋友。我以为我能依靠你。好吧，你的行为结束了我们的关系。我不会再跟你说一句话。再也不会。再也不会。你以为我会看上你那些陈腐不堪的钱吗？哦，说这不是你本意一点用都没有。要不是靠我，你能有什么名堂，我倒想知道。你得到的那些名气，你在这个世界上如果有一点重要性，那都是因为你恰巧认识我的缘故。是谁让你的聚会这些年来一直高朋满座？你以为人们去你的聚会是为了见你吗？他们是来看我的。再也不会这样了。永远不会。”

事实上，这更像是一场独白，而不是对话。

后来，在电影院，如她设想的，她坐在汤姆旁边，握着他的手，但她却感到汤姆异常冷漠，像一片鱼翅。她怀疑汤姆还在忐忑不安地思考迈克尔的话。她希望有个机会能跟他说几句话，让他不要担心。毕竟，没人能像她那样巧妙地应对此事。泰然自若，就是这个词。她在想，多莉到底跟迈克尔说了什么。她最好查清楚。问迈克尔是不行的，那样的话会显得她对此事很重视；她必须直接去问多莉。最好不要跟多莉闹翻了。当她想到她和多莉对话的场景，不由得微笑起来。她会甜言蜜语，能够哄骗多莉说出所有实情，绝对不会让多莉察觉她有一丝生气。很奇怪，当她想到人们在议论她时，她的后背打了一阵冷战。说到底，如果她都不能够随心所欲的话，还有谁能够呢？她的私人生活跟其他任何人无关。同时，不得不承认，如果人们在她背后嘲笑她，也不是什么让人感到愉快的事情。她在想，如果迈克尔知道实情后会怎么做。他不可能同她离婚后继续替她经营剧院。如果他有点脑子，应该选择不闻不问。但迈克尔有些方面很可笑；时不时他会气势汹汹，开始他那套上校的做派。他能突然说出，去他妈的，他必须要表现得像个绅士这种话。男人都是这样的蠢货，为了泄愤竟会伤害到自己，专门跟自己过不去。当然，对她来说这倒没什么大不了的。她可以去美国演一年，直到丑闻平息，然后可以和别人一起继续经营剧院。但那样的话可真够令人讨厌的。此外，还有罗杰要考虑；他会感觉到的，可怜的家伙；他自然会觉得屈辱；逃避事实没什么好处，在她的年龄，为了一个二十三岁的男孩离婚，她会被认为是个彻头彻尾的蠢蛋。当然，她不会蠢到要嫁给汤姆。查尔斯会娶她吗？她转头看着暗光中他那高雅的轮廓。他疯狂地痴迷了她好多年；他正是女人用一个小手指就能任意摆布的那些有骑士精神的白痴中的一个。他可能会不介意代替汤姆作为离婚诉讼的共同被告，那倒是不错的结局。查尔斯·泰默利夫人。听起来不错。也许她有一些草率。她去汤姆的公寓时总是很小心，但可能被马车房里的一两个司机看到她出入了，于是胡思乱想。那个阶层的人的想法很肮脏。至于夜总会，她更乐意和汤姆去那些安静的，没人会看到他们的地方去，但他不喜欢。他喜欢人群，他想要见到时髦的人物，他也想引人注目。他喜欢显摆她。

“可恶，”她对自己说道，“可恶，可恶。”

这一晚，朱莉娅并没有她预想中的那样享受电影。





第十八章


第二天，朱莉娅用私人电话打给了多莉。

“亲爱的，似乎有好久没见到你了。这段时间你自己忙什么呢？”

“并没有什么。”

多莉的声音听起来很冷漠。

“听着，罗杰明天就到家了。你知道，他要离开伊顿了。我会派车早一点去接他回来，我想让你过来吃午餐。不是聚会，就只有你、我、迈克尔和罗杰。”

“明天我有约要出去吃午餐。”

有二十年了，只要朱莉娅邀请多莉一同做什么事情，她永远都会奉陪。电话那端的声音听起来充满敌意。

“多莉，你怎么能这么无情？罗杰会非常失望的。他第一天到家；另外，我也想见你。我好久都没见到你了，非常想念你。难道不能失约一次？就这一次，亲爱的，午饭后我们好好聊一聊，就你和我？”

当朱莉娅愿意的时候，没有人能比她更具有说服力，谁的声音都不如她的柔情似水，谁的恳求都不如她的无法抵挡。电话那端有一阵停顿，朱莉娅知道多莉在和她自己那受伤的感情做斗争。

“好吧，亲爱的，我会想想办法的。”

“亲爱的。”朱莉娅挂掉电话后咬牙切齿地说道，“这头老母牛。”

多莉来了。她对罗杰说他长大了，以及一些她认为适合这个年纪的男孩的话，罗杰在一旁彬彬有礼，并适时地用他那沉重的微笑予以回应。他让朱莉娅感到困惑。他话很少，只顾听着其他人的对话，似乎全神贯注，但朱莉娅有种奇怪的感觉，觉得他在想自己的事情。他似乎以一种抽离的好奇心在观察他们，就好像他在观察动物园里的动物。这让人有点不安。当机会来了，朱莉娅便说出为多莉所准备的那一小段对话。

“哦，亲爱的罗杰，你知道你可怜的父亲今晚很忙。我有两张帕拉狄昂剧院第二场的戏票，汤姆想跟你在皇家咖啡馆吃饭。”

“哦！”罗杰停顿了一下，“好的。”

她转向多莉。

“有汤姆这样的人能陪罗杰一起真是太好了。他们是很好的朋友，你知道吧。”

迈克尔瞟了多莉一眼，眼睛里放着光。他说道：

“汤姆是个非常体面的男孩。他不会让罗杰惹上什么麻烦的。”

“我以为罗杰会更愿意跟他伊顿的朋友们一起出去。”多莉说道。

“老母牛，”朱莉娅心里想着，“老母牛。”

当午饭结束后，她邀请多莉去她的房间。

“我要上床睡一会儿，我休息的时候你可以跟我聊天。属于两个老女孩之间的谈话，这正是我想要的。”

她用胳膊亲切地缠住多莉粗壮的腰身，领着她上了楼。一开始，她们聊一些无关紧要的事情，衣服、仆人、化妆还有丑闻；然后朱莉娅倚着她的胳膊肘，用信任的眼光看着多莉。

“多莉，有些事情我想告诉你。我需要建议，而这世上唯有你的建议我会听。我知道我能相信你。”

“当然，亲爱的。”

“似乎有人在传一些有关我的很不好听的话。有人去跟迈克尔讲了，告诉他社会上有好多关于我和可怜的汤姆·芬内尔的流言。”

尽管她的眼睛依旧闪烁着迷人而富有感染力的光芒，她知道多莉无法抵御这眼神，但她密切注视着对方，看多莉脸上会不会显露出震惊或表情有所变化。然而她什么也没看到。

“谁告诉迈克尔的？”

“我不知道。他不肯说。你知道当他绅士起来的时候是什么样。”

她不知是否只是她的想象，似乎多莉听到了这话后稍稍放松了些。

“我想知道真相，多莉。”

“我很开心你来问我，亲爱的。你知道我有多讨厌干涉别人的事情，如果你自己不提起它，谁也不会诱使我提到它。”

“我的宝贝，如果连我都不知道你有多么忠诚，还有谁知道？”

多莉脱掉鞋子，扎实地坐在她的椅子里。朱莉娅的目光始终都没有离开她。

“你知道人心可以多坏。你一直都过着平静规矩的生活。你几乎不会外出，要么就只跟迈克尔或者查尔斯·泰默利出去。他不一样；所有人都知道他爱慕了你这么多年。因此，突然间你跟着一个做你剧院账务的公司职员满世界跑，这看起来很可笑。”

“他并不只是个职员。他父亲为他买了那个公司的一部分股份，他是一个初级合伙人。”

“是的，他一年挣四百英镑。”

“你怎么知道的？”朱莉娅立刻问道。

这次，她很肯定多莉有一点不安。

“你劝我去他的公司咨询收入税的事情。其中一个主要的合伙人告诉我的。就凭他那点薪水，竟能住得起一套公寓，穿得阔气，还带人去夜总会。”

“据我所知，他父亲还给他额外的津贴。”

“他父亲是伦敦北部的一个律师。你应该很清楚，如果他父亲给他购买了合伙股份，是没有能力再给他什么津贴了。”

“你肯定不会猜想是我在养着他吧。”朱莉娅说道，发出清脆的笑声。

“我什么也没乱猜，亲爱的。而其他人在这么做。”

朱莉娅既不喜欢多莉所说的话，也不喜欢她说话的方式。但她没有表露出任何不舒服的信号。

“太荒唐了。比起跟我的友谊，他更是罗杰的朋友。当然，最近我跟他一起跑东跑西，但那是因为我觉得我的生活太死板了。我厌恶了每天去剧院、自己照顾自己。没有生活可言。毕竟，如果我现在不享受一下，我再也不会有机会了。我越来越老了，多莉，你知道，这也用不着否定。而且，你知道迈克尔的样子，当然他很可爱，但他令人厌烦。”

“不会有人比过去的他更令人厌烦吧。”多莉尖酸地说。

“我本以为，人们不会觉得我会跟一个比自己小二十岁的男孩发生什么私情。”

“二十五岁，”多莉纠正道，“我也以为这样。不幸的是，他并没有很小心谨慎。”

“你这是什么意思？”

“他告诉艾维丝·克赖顿他会在你的下一部戏剧中帮她争取到一个角色。”

“艾维丝·克赖顿是谁？”

“哦，她是个我认识的年轻演员。她美得如同一幅画。”

“他只是一个傻孩子。我设想他或许觉得可以让迈克尔同意吧。你知道，迈克尔是如何对待他的那些小角色的。”

“他说他能让你做任何他想做的事情。他说你完全听他的。”

幸亏朱莉娅是个好演员。有一秒，她的心脏停止了跳动。他怎么能那么说？蠢东西。该死的蠢货。但她立刻让自己镇定下来，轻轻地笑了笑。

“一派胡言！我一点都不信。”

“他是个极其普通，甚至有点恶俗的年轻男人。如果你对他的小题大做让他昏了头，这一点也不惊奇。”

朱莉娅好性子地微笑着，坦诚地看着多莉。

“但是，亲爱的，你不会觉得他是我的情人吧？”

“如果我不这么觉得，我就是唯一那个不这么认为的人了。”

“那么你这么认为吗？”

有一阵多莉没有回答。她们紧紧盯着彼此，心中满怀恨意；但朱莉娅还是微笑着。

“如果你用人格担保，对我发誓，我当然会相信你。”

朱莉娅让声音变得低沉严肃。这确实有了一种真诚的效果。

“我从来没有对你撒过谎，多莉，我年纪这么大了也不可能再对你撒谎。我向你发誓，汤姆对我而言仅仅是一个朋友。”

“你把我心头一块重重的石头搬走了。”

朱莉娅知道多莉并没有相信她，多莉也知道朱莉娅很明白这一点。她继续说道：

“但为了以防万一，为了你好，朱莉娅宝贝儿，明智一些。不要再跟那个年轻人四处跑了。甩掉他。”

“哦，我不能那么做。那样的话不就承认了人们所想的是对的吗？反正我问心无愧。我没什么可羞耻的。如果我让可恶的流言影响了我的行为，我会瞧不起我自己。”

多莉穿上了鞋，从她的手提包中拿出口红涂嘴唇。

“好吧，亲爱的，你这年纪也知道自己想要什么了。”

她们冷淡地分了手。

但多莉的一两句话让朱莉娅有点震惊，让她难以释怀。流言如此接近事实让她惶惶不安。但这真的有什么了不起吗？很多女人都有情人，谁又会管呢？一个女演员。没人会期望一个女演员是守规矩的典型。

“是我那该死的美德。这才是问题的症结所在。”

她有一个贞洁无比的女人的名声，丑闻的毒舌从来触摸不到她，而现在看起来，她的名声更像是她为自己建起来的一座监狱。但还有更糟糕的。汤姆说的她完全任他摆布是什么意思？这深深地冒犯了她。愚蠢的小傻子。他怎么敢这么说？她不知道对此该怎么办。她本想对他痛骂一番。但那又有什么用？他会否认这一切。唯一的方法就是什么都不说；现在一切都为时已晚，她必须接受一切。逃避真相一点用都没有，他不爱她，他做她的情人就是因为这关系满足了他的自尊，给了他在乎的一切，在他眼里这关系至少给他带来一种地位。

“如果我有脑子的话，我应该甩掉他。”她生气地大笑了一声，“说起来容易。但我爱他。”

奇怪的是，当她审视内心时，发现并不是朱莉娅·兰伯特这个女人在憎恨这种冒犯，她不关心自己，实际上，对朱莉娅·兰伯特这个女演员的冒犯让她内心刺痛。她曾经经常觉得，她的才能，评论家口中的天才，但这词太宏大，那就叫她的天赋吧，其实并不属于她自己，甚至不是她的一部分，而更像是外在的什么东西通过她——朱莉娅·兰伯特这个女人——来表达自己。它似乎是降临在她身上的一种奇怪而无形的人格，通过她做出一些她并不知道自己可以做的一些事情。她是一个普通的还算美丽的、正在衰老的女人。她的天赋既没有年龄又没有形体。它是一种在她身体上起着作用的精神，就像小提琴家弹奏他的小提琴一样。正是对这精神的轻蔑让她难过。

她试着入睡。她习惯于在下午睡一会儿，只要一静下心来就能入睡，但是这次她翻来覆去，总是睡不着。最后她看了眼时钟。汤姆一般在五点稍过一点儿从事务所回来。她渴望着他；在他的怀抱里会有安宁，和他在一起时，一切都抛到九霄云外了。她拨了他的电话号码。

“哈喽？是的。你是谁？”

她把话筒按在耳朵上，目瞪口呆。这是罗杰的声音。她把电话挂了。





第十九章


那一夜朱莉娅没有睡好。听到罗杰回来，她醒了，打开灯，看到是夜里四点。她皱了皱眉头。第二天早晨，她正想起身，他从石楼梯上咔嗒咔嗒走下来了。

“我能进来吗，妈妈？”

“进来。”

他还穿着他的睡袍和晨衣。她冲他微笑，因为他看起来如此充满朝气，又如此年轻。

“昨晚你回来得太晚了。”

“不，没有很晚。我一点回来的。”

“撒谎。我看表了，是四点。”

“好吧，是四点。”他乐呵呵地同意了。

“你们到底做什么去了？”

“表演结束后我们去了别的地方，吃了晚饭。我们还跳舞了。”

“和谁？”

“我们挑的几个女孩。汤姆之前认识她们。”

“她们叫什么？”

“一个叫吉尔，一个叫琼。我不知道她们的全名。琼是个演员。她问我是否能在您的下部剧中让她当预备演员。”

反正她们俩都不是艾维丝·克赖顿。自从多莉提到后，这个名字一直出现在她的脑海里。

“但那些地方不会开到四点。”

“不，我们先回到汤姆的公寓。汤姆让我保证不告诉您。他说你会非常生气。”

“哦，我的宝贝，我不会因为这么点小事就生气的。我向你保证不会对此提一个字。”

“如果要怪也得怪我。昨天下午我去看汤姆，我们安排了这一切。所有我们在戏里看到和在小说里读到的关于爱情的那套玩意儿。我快十八岁了。我想我应该亲自看看这都是怎么回事。”

朱莉娅从床上坐起来，睁大眼睛，满是疑问。

“罗杰，你什么意思？”

他镇定而严肃。

“汤姆说他认识一对还不错的女孩。之前他拥有她们俩。她们住在一起，所以我们可以给她们打电话，并约她们在表演结束后见。他告诉她们我还是一个处男，她们最好投硬币决定谁跟我。当我们回到公寓后，他带着吉尔进了卧室，把我和琼留在客厅。”

有一阵儿她并没有在想汤姆，而是对罗杰所说的话感到十分不安。

“我觉得没什么了不起的。看不出有什么大惊小怪的。”

她说不出话来，眼眶里满是泪水，泪珠迅速地顺着脸颊流了下来。

“妈妈，怎么了？你为什么在哭？”

“可你还是个小男孩。”

他朝她走过来，坐在她的床边，张开双臂拥抱了她。

“亲爱的，别哭。如果我知道这会让你不安，我不会告诉你的。反正这事儿迟早会发生。”

“但是太早了。太早了。让我觉得我自己好老。”

“你一点都不老，亲爱的。‘年龄不能使她衰老，习惯也腐蚀不了她的变化无穷的伎俩。(1)’”

她破涕而笑。

“你个小傻子，罗杰，你以为克利奥帕特拉会喜欢那老蠢驴对她的赞颂吗？你应该再等待一段时间嘛。”

“不再等了也不错。现在我都明白了。说实话，对此我觉得很恶心。”

她深深地叹了口气。被他温柔地抱着对她是一种慰藉。但她为自己感到遗憾。

“你没有生我的气吧，亲爱的？”他问道。

“生气？不。不过如果这事情一定要发生的话，我希望它不是这么平淡。你谈论它的口气就好像是在讲一次有趣的实验。”

“我觉得某种意义上是这么回事。”

她冲他微微一笑。

“你真的认为那就是爱？”

“它是大部分人所指的，不是吗？”

“不，不是。他们说的是痛苦和气愤、羞愧、狂喜、天堂和地狱；他们说的是强烈的生活之感，还有彻头彻尾的厌恶；是自由和奴役；是平和与不安。”

罗杰倾听这番话时的沉静使得她透过睫毛看了他一眼。他的双眼中有一种奇怪的神情。她不知道那意味着什么，就好像他在沉重地听着从很远的地方传来的声音。

“听起来一点劲儿也没有。”他喃喃道。

她双手捧着他那光滑的脸，亲吻了他的嘴唇。

“我是个笨蛋，不是吗？你看，我还把你当作我怀里的那个小婴儿。”

罗杰眼中闪过一道光。

“你笑什么，你这猴子？”

“我们这姿势会拍出很美的照片，不是吗？”

她忍不住大笑起来。

“你这头猪。你这头讨厌的猪。”

“我说，关于那个预备演员的事情，有什么机会给琼吗？”

“告诉她，让她某天来见我。”

但当罗杰离开时，她叹了口气。她很沮丧，感到非常孤独。她的生活如此丰富精彩，从没有时间操心过罗杰。当然，在他患百日咳或者出麻疹的时候，她会紧张起来，但大体上罗杰都非常健康，于是她心安理得地将他抛于脑后。然而，她总是觉得，在她想要照顾他的时候，他就在那儿等着她的照顾，而且，她经常想，等他长到可以分享她的兴趣爱好时会很美好。现在，她震惊地意识到，她还没有来得及拥有他，就已经失去了他。当她想到从她身边夺走罗杰的那个女孩时，她下意识地抿起了嘴唇。

“预备演员？见鬼去吧。”

她沉浸在自己的痛苦中，反倒没有为汤姆的不忠而感到悲痛。她骨子里一直明白，他对她不忠诚。在他这个年纪，以他这样放纵的脾性，再加上她忙于剧院的表演以及她的身份强加于她的各种约会，很明显，他有足够的机会随心所欲。她闭上了双眼。她希望自己不知道这一切。这是第一次，有关他不忠的事实摆在了她的面前。

“我必须忍受这些。”她叹气道。各种想法在她的脑子里飘荡。“这就像你明明在说谎，却不知道自己在说谎，这才是最致命的；我想，知道自己是个傻瓜比不知道要好一些。”

第二十章


汤姆和他的家人去了伊斯特本(1)过圣诞节。朱莉娅在节礼日(2)有两场演出，因此，格斯林一家待在城里过节；他们去了多莉·德·弗里斯为了迎接新年而举办的盛大聚会；几天之后，罗杰就去了维也纳。汤姆在城里的时候，朱莉娅也几乎见不到他。她并没有问罗杰他们一起满城转悠都做了些什么，她不想知道，她强迫自己不去想，并尽可能多地参加各种聚会，以此分散她的注意力。再说，还有她的演出；一旦她进入剧院，她的愤怒、屈辱，还有她的嫉妒都得到了缓解。她仿佛在她的油彩罐内找到了人类的悲哀侵袭不到的另一个人格，这给了她战胜一切的力量。凭借这个便利的庇护所，她能够支撑一切。

罗杰离开的那天，汤姆从他的办公室打电话给她。

“今晚你做什么？要不要去狂欢一下？”

“不，我很忙。”

事实并非如此，这些脱口而出的话非她所愿。

“哦，是吗？那么，明天呢？”

如果他表现出一点失望，如果他让她取消他以为存在的约请，她可能会有勇气立刻跟他决断。但他的漫不经心将她打败了。

“明天可以。”

“好的。演出结束后我去剧院接你。再见。”

当他出现在她的更衣间时，朱莉娅已经准备好了，正在等着他的到来。她出奇地紧张。当他看到她时，他的脸上泛起光芒，当伊维离开房间后，他拥抱着她，热情地吻了她的嘴。

“这下我好过多了。”他笑道。

看着他，如此年轻，有朝气，天真烂漫，活力四射，你不会想到他给朱莉娅带来多少痛苦。你不会想到他如此虚伪。很明显，他一点都没有意识到，已经半个多月了他几乎没有见她。

（“哦，上帝，要是我能告诉他见鬼去吧该有多好。”）

但她看着他，漂亮的双眼中都是欢乐的笑意。

“我们去哪儿？”

“我在奎格饭店订了个位子。他们那儿有个新节目，是个美国魔术师，表演可精彩啦。”

晚餐的时候，朱莉娅兴奋地讲个不停。她告诉他这些日子去的各种聚会，还有她摆脱不掉的那些戏剧界的集会，看起来似乎仅仅是因为由于她的邀约，他们才没能见得上面。看到他对这事儿理所当然的态度，让她不安。他很开心见到她，这很明显，他对她所做的事和所见的人都很感兴趣，但显而易见他并没有想念她。朱莉娅告诉汤姆她接到了去纽约演出的邀请，以及对方提出的条件，她想知道汤姆对此作何反应。

“太棒了，”他说道，双眼闪着光芒，“多好的机会！你不会失败，你准能挣到一大笔钱。”

“唯一的问题是我不太愿意离开伦敦。”

“为什么不？我以为你会非常愿意。目前的剧目上演太久了，你也知道，演到复活节肯定就会结束了。而且，如果你想在美国一显身手，没有比这个更好的剧本了。”

“我不明白为什么不演到夏天结束。另外，我不喜欢陌生人。我喜欢我的朋友们。”

“我觉得这想法太愚蠢了。你的朋友们没有你也会过得很好。同时，你会在纽约有段美妙的时光。”

她那欢快的笑声令人信服。

“还以为你千方百计地想摆脱我呢。”

“当然我会非常想念你。但就只有几个月。如果我有这样的机会，我一定会抓住它。”

晚餐结束后，饭店的门卫为他们叫了一辆出租车，他告诉司机公寓的地址，好像他们应该理所当然地回到那儿去。在出租车里，他搂着她的腰，吻了她。后来，当她躺在他的怀抱里，在那张小小的单人床上，她感到过去两周所忍受的所有痛苦对于她现在感受到的内心的平静都算不上什么。

朱莉娅继续和汤姆出入那些时髦的饭店和夜总会。如果人们认为汤姆是她的情人，随他们去吧；她已经不再在乎了。但不止一次，当她想让汤姆陪她一起去什么地方，他都已经有约了。汤姆在搞定收入税这方面很有一套，这名声在朱莉娅那些有名的朋友中间已经传开了。丹诺伦特一家邀请他去乡下共度周末，在那儿他遇见了一些很愿意借助他专业知识的人。汤姆开始接收到朱莉娅不认识的人的邀请。熟人们也会向朱莉娅提及汤姆。

“你认识汤姆·芬内尔，对吧？他很聪明，不是吗？我听说他帮助吉列安一家在收入税上省了几百英镑。”

朱莉娅听到这些一点也开心不起来。他是通过她才能去这些他想去的聚会。现在看起来，似乎他已经不再需要她了。他和蔼可亲，一点也不装腔作势，穿着得体，外表清秀、整洁，让人喜欢；他能帮助人们省钱；朱莉娅对他迫不及待地想要进入的那个世界非常了解，知道很快他就能在里面站稳脚跟了。她对那个世界里的女人们的道德原则没什么赞誉，她能够数出不止一个有意愿把他抢到手的女贵族。朱莉娅欣慰的是她们都是些同猫食一样低贱的货色。多莉曾说他一年只有四百镑；靠这点钱他肯定无法在那个圈子里生存。

在她跟汤姆提到去美国演出这事儿之前，她就已经决定要拒绝邀请了；他们目前的剧目一直很叫座。但是就在这时候，偶尔影响剧院的没由头的萧条期席卷伦敦，因而营业收入骤然下降。看起来他们无法将这部戏演到复活节之后了。他们有一部新剧被寄予厚望。这部剧叫《当今时代》，原本计划在秋季推出。这里有一个很不错的角色给朱莉娅，还有一个角色很适合迈克尔出演。这是一部能轻松上演一年的戏剧。迈克尔不想五月就推出，随后暑季马上来临，但目前来看也没有别的办法，于是他开始寻找演员。

一天下午，在日常演出的间歇，伊维给朱莉娅带来一张纸条。她惊讶地看到了罗杰的笔迹。

亲爱的妈妈：

我来向您介绍我曾提起的琼·丹佛小姐。她非常想加入西登斯剧院，不论角色多么小，如果她能作为一个预备演员就知足了。

你亲爱的儿子

罗杰

看到他写得一本正经，朱莉娅微笑起来；她被逗乐了，因为他已经长大到开始试图给自己的女朋友找工作了。然后，她突然想起琼·丹佛是谁。琼和吉尔。她是那个引诱可怜的罗杰的女孩。她的脸严肃起来。但她也很好奇，想见见她。

“乔治在吗？”乔治是看门人。伊维点点头，打开了门。

“乔治。”

他走进来。

“带来这封信的那个女孩现在还在吗？”

“还在，小姐。”

“告诉她，演出结束后我会见她。”

她在戏里最后一幕穿着一袭有拖裙的晚礼服，那是一袭很华丽的服装，完美地显出了她美丽的体形。她深色的头发上别着钻石发饰，手臂上戴着钻石手镯。她看起来如同角色需求的那般，有女王风范。她在最后一次谢幕后立刻接见了琼·丹佛。朱莉娅能够转眼之间就从她的角色跳入她的个人生活，但现在，她毫不费力地依旧继续扮演那个傲慢、冷淡、端庄而极有教养的女人。

“我让你等了这么久，我想，我不能让你再等到我卸妆换完衣服了。”

她亲切的微笑是女王的微笑；她的礼貌使你保持着一种尊重的距离。她一眼就看清了走进化妆间的那个年轻姑娘。她年轻，长着一张美丽的小脸蛋和一个狮子鼻，但浓妆艳抹，化得媚俗。

“她的腿太短了，”朱莉娅想，“非常二流。”

很明显她已经穿上了她最好的衣服，刚才那一眼已经告诉朱莉娅一切。

（“沙夫茨伯里大街的货色。赊账买的。”）

这个可怜的东西现在紧张得很。朱莉娅让她坐下来，递给她一支香烟。

“你旁边有火柴。”

朱莉娅看到她试图点烟的时候手在发抖。第一根火柴灭了，她划了火柴盒三次才点着第二根。

（“要是罗杰能看到现在的她就好了！廉价的腮红，廉价的口红，惊慌失措。他以为她是个欢快可爱的小东西。”）

“你演戏时间很久了吗？对不起，我忘记你的名字了。”

“琼·丹佛。”她的嗓子很干，几乎无法说话。她的烟灭了，只能无助地拿着。她回答了朱莉娅的问题。“两年。”

“你多大？”

“十九岁。”

（“撒谎。你至少有二十二岁了。”）“你认识我儿子？”

“是的。”

“他刚离开伊顿，去维也纳学习德文。当然他很年轻，但他父亲和我认为在去剑桥前最好能在国外待上几个月。你演过什么角色？你的烟灭了。不再来一根吗？”

“哦，没关系，谢谢。我一直都在外地巡演。但我渴望在伦敦演戏。”绝望给了她勇气，她说出了明显是准备好的话。“我对您非常景仰，兰伯特小姐。我总是说，您是戏剧界最伟大的女演员。我从您身上学到的要远比我在皇家戏剧艺术学院那一年学到的多。我最大的愿望就是进入您的剧院，兰伯特小姐，你要是能设法让我演一点什么，我知道那将是一个女孩子所能得到的再好不过的机会。”

“你能摘下帽子吗？”

琼·丹佛摘下了她那顶廉价的帽子，快速地甩了甩她修得短短的鬈发。

“你头发真漂亮。”朱莉娅说道。

仍然是以那种稍带傲慢但又无限亲切的微笑，那种女王在皇家游行中给予她的臣民的微笑，朱莉娅注视着她，没有说话。她想起珍妮·塔特布的名言：除非必要，不要停顿，如果要停顿，就要尽可能长久地停顿。她几乎能听到那女孩的心跳，她感到她在那套成衣里、在她的皮囊里蜷缩着。

“是什么让你想到让我儿子向我推荐你？”

琼的脸在化妆品的遮盖下渐渐变红，她咽了口唾沫才开始回答。

“我在朋友的房子里遇见他，我告诉他我有多仰慕您，他说或许您下部剧可能会有什么角色给我。”

“我正在考虑这些角色。”

“我并没有在想真的演个角色。如果我能做个预备演员，我是说，那样我就可以参加排练，学习您的技巧。这本身就是一种培养，所有人都这么认为。”

（“愚蠢的小傻子，想拍我的马屁。就好像我不知道这一套似的。而且我为什么要培养她？”）“多谢你这么说。我只是一个非常普通的人。公众都太和善了，非常和善。你是个漂亮的小东西，而且很年轻。年轻真是太美好了。我们的宗旨就是要多给年轻的人机会。毕竟我们不可能永远待在舞台上，我们觉得，培养男女演员并在合适的时候替代我们，是我们对公众的义务。”

朱莉娅用她那修饰得悦耳的声音，把这些话说得淳朴至极，让琼·丹佛的心立刻温暖起来。她已经说服了这位老大姐，预备演员是稳稳到手了。汤姆·芬内尔早跟她说了，她只要把罗杰摆布得好，是很容易有所收获的。

“哦，那是很久之后的事了，兰伯特小姐。”她说道。她的双眼，她那双漂亮的黑色眼睛散发着光芒。

（“你说得太对了，我的女孩，太对了。我敢打赌我七十岁的时候也能把你从舞台上演下去。”）

“我必须再想一想。我还不知道我们下部剧需要什么样的预备演员。”

“我听见有人说艾维丝·克赖顿要演那少女的角色。我想或许我可以做她的替补。”

艾维丝·克赖顿。朱莉娅的双眼没有显露出这个名字对她有任何意义。

“我丈夫提起过她，但一切还没有定。我根本不认识她。她聪明吗？”

“我认为是的。我曾跟她一起在皇家戏剧艺术学院上学。”

“他们跟我说，她美得如同一幅画。”朱莉娅站起身来，表示接见到此为止。于是，她放下了她的女王架子，换了一个调子，一下子变成了一个助人为乐、兴高采烈而且和蔼可亲的女演员。“好吧，亲爱的，你把姓名和地址留下，有消息我通知你。”

“您不会忘记我吧，兰伯特小姐？”

“不，亲爱的，我向你保证不会的。很高兴见到你。你的性格真讨人喜欢。你自己能找到出去的路，对吗？再见。”

“她休想踏进这个剧院。”琼走后，朱莉娅在心里说，“这条肮脏的小母狗诱惑了我的儿子。可怜的小家伙。可耻，真可耻，就这么回事；这样的女人必须被阻止。”

她一边脱下美丽的礼服，一边望着镜子里自己的影子。她目光冷酷，嘴边带着嘲讽的笑。她对着镜子里的影子说：

“我可以告诉你这句话，老朋友：有一个人休想演《当今时代》，那个人就是艾维丝·克赖顿小姐。”

第二十一章


但大约一周后，迈克尔就提到了她。

“我说，你听说过一个叫艾维丝·克赖顿的女孩吗？”

“从来没有。”

“我听人说她很不错，是个淑女等等。她父亲在部队。我在想，是否要她来演奥娜。”

“你怎么听说她的？”

“汤姆说的。他认识她，他说她很聪明。她在星期天夜间秀上表演。事实上就是下个星期天。他说或许值得去看一眼。”

“那么，你怎么不去？”

“我准备去桑威奇(1)打高尔夫。你会很讨厌去看看吗？我估计那戏很烂，但你能知道是否值得让她读一读那角色的台词。汤姆会跟你一起去。”

朱莉娅的心跳骤然加快。

“没问题，我会去的。”

她打电话给汤姆，让他过来，在去剧院前他们先一起吃点东西。汤姆到的时候，她还没有准备好。

“是我迟到了，还是你早到了？”当她走进会客厅时说道。

她看到汤姆已经等得不耐烦了。他既紧张又着急。

“他们八点整开始，”他说道，“我讨厌在一部剧开场后到。”

他的焦虑已经告诉了她想知道的一切。她则慢慢享用她的鸡尾酒。

“我们今晚要去看的那位女演员叫什么名字？”她问道。

“艾维丝·克赖顿。我急于知道你对她的看法。我觉得她是个新兴之秀。她知道你今晚会去。她非常紧张，但我告诉她没有必要。你知道那些星期天晚上的剧目都是什么样的；排练潦草等等；我说你会理解这些的，会很宽容。”

整个晚餐他都在不停地看表。朱莉娅扮演一个世故的女人。她一会儿聊这个，一会儿聊那个，并注意到他心不在焉。一旦有机会，他便把对话扯回到艾维丝·克赖顿身上。

“当然我还没有对她说什么，但是我觉得她很适合奥娜这个角色。”正如朱莉娅所有出演的剧本，他都会在戏上演前读一遍一样，他已经读过《当今时代》的剧本。“她很像这个角色，我敢保证这点。她很努力，当然这对她来说也是非常好的机会。她对你仰慕至极，非常想和你一起演戏。”

“这是可以理解的。这意味着可以连演一年，还会有一大堆剧院经理会看到她。”

“她头发颜色正合适，肤色很白；她跟你很相衬。”

“现在以染发和漂白的技术，舞台上可并不缺少金发女郎啊。”

“但她的是天生的。”

“是吗？今早我收到罗杰的一封信。他似乎在维也纳过得不错。”

汤姆的兴致淡了下去。他看了看手表。当咖啡上来的时候，朱莉娅说没法喝。她说必须得重做。

“哦，朱莉娅，这一点也不值当。我们会迟到太久的。”

“我觉得如果迟到了几分钟没什么要紧的。”

他的声音充满苦恼：“我保证了我们不会迟到。她在剧目一开始有一场很不错的戏。”

“对不起，但是不喝咖啡我没法出门。”

在他们等咖啡的时候，她继续谈笑风生。他几乎不作回答。他焦虑地看着门。当咖啡来了，她却开始刻意地品尝，让人着急得发疯。当他们上了车，他已经是横眉冷对的状态，沉默地目视前方，脸上郁郁不乐，嘴巴生气地噘着。朱莉娅不无得意。他们在幕布升起的两分钟前进入剧院，当朱莉娅出现在那儿时，观众爆发了掌声。朱莉娅一边向打扰了的人们致歉，一边挤到她那位于剧院中央的座位。当她恰到好处地入场时，观众响起欢迎的掌声，她以微笑答谢，同时，她低垂的目光谦逊地表明并不承认这掌声跟她有任何关系。

幕布升起，一段短短的场景过后，两个女孩出现在舞台上，一个既漂亮又年轻，另外一个则年长很多，长相很普通。不久朱莉娅转向汤姆，悄声说道：

“哪一个是艾维丝·克赖顿，年轻的还是年长的？”

“年轻的那个。”

“哦，当然了，你说过她很漂亮，不是吗？”

她看了一眼汤姆的脸。他已经没有刚才生气的表情了；转而，一个欢快的微笑荡漾在他的嘴角。朱莉娅将注意力转移到舞台上。艾维丝·克赖顿确实很漂亮，没人能够否认这点，她有一头可爱的金发，一双精致的蓝眼睛，还长着一个小巧笔挺的鼻子；但朱莉娅并不喜欢她这种类型。

“无趣，”她对自己说，“歌舞女郎而已。”

她看了一阵艾维丝的表演，她看得很认真；然后她靠回座椅上，叹了口气。

“她根本不会演戏。”她下结论道。

当幕布拉上后，汤姆急切地转向她。他已经完全没有了刚才的坏脾气。

“你觉得她怎么样？”

“她确实跟画一样漂亮。”

“我知道这点。但是她的演技呢？你觉得她演得好吗？”

“是的，很聪明。”

“我希望你能过去亲自告诉她。这会给她莫大的鼓励。”

“我？”

他不知道他在要求她做什么。她，朱莉娅·兰伯特，会到后台祝贺一个小角色的女演员，这简直前所未闻。

“我答应了在第二幕结束后我会带你过去。赏个脸吧，朱莉娅。这会让她非常开心的。”

（“浑蛋。该死的浑蛋。好吧，我忍了。”）“当然，如果你觉得这会对她有什么意义，我乐意过去。”

第二幕结束后，他们穿过铁门，汤姆带着她来到艾维丝·克赖顿的化妆间。她和一同入场的那个普通女孩共享这间化妆间。汤姆替她作了介绍。她有些做作地伸出一只软弱无力的手。

“见到您我太高兴了，兰伯特小姐。这化妆间太不像样了，请您别介意好吗？但就为了一个晚上而把它整理得好一些也没什么意义。”

她一点也不紧张。事实上，她镇定自若。

（“态度真强硬。指望这个大好机会，给我来上校女儿那一套。”）

“您能过来真是太好了。我担心这算不上什么戏剧，但像我这样的起点，只能有什么角色演什么角色了。他们给我送来剧本的时候我也很迟疑，但我很喜欢那个角色。”

“你演得很好。”朱莉娅说道。

“您这么说真是太客气了。我希望我们能多排练几回。我尤其想让您看看我的演技。”

“你知道，我在这行这么多年。我一直认为，是金子总会发光的。你不这么觉得吗？”

“我知道您的意思。当然，我想要积累更多的经验，我知道这些，但我更需要的是一个机会。我知道我能表演。如果我能得到一个可以让我投入进去的角色就好了。”

她等了一会儿，想让朱莉娅说自己的新剧目里正好有适合她的角色，但朱莉娅继续微笑地看着她。朱莉娅极其可笑地发现自己竟被当作助理牧师的妻子，而大地主的太太正对她示以仁慈。

“你演戏时间很久了吗？”她最终问道，“很奇怪我从来没有听说过你。”

“我演了一段时间的歌舞剧，但我觉得那是在浪费我的时间。上一个演出季我一直在外巡演。如果可以，我再也不想离开伦敦了。”

“戏剧界竞争很激烈。”朱莉娅说道。

“哦，我知道。除非你有影响力或其他什么，想出人头地简直看起来毫无希望。我听说您很快要上一出新剧。”

“是的。”

朱莉娅继续微笑着，态度和蔼得不像话。

“如果里面有个角色能给我，我会非常愿意和您一起演戏。很遗憾格斯林先生今晚无法过来。”

“我会把你的情况告诉他的。”

“您觉得真的有机会给我吗？”在她的自信中，在她为了给朱莉娅留下深刻印象而装出的乡间别墅人士的气派中，都贯穿着一种急于求成的焦躁，“如果您能替我说句话，那对我帮助太大了。”

朱莉娅若有所思地看了她一眼。

“比起我丈夫采纳我的建议，更多的是我听他的建议。”她微笑道。

为了让艾维丝·克赖顿换衣服准备第三幕剧，他们离开了化妆间，朱莉娅看到艾维斯在跟汤姆说再见时给了他一个询问的眼神。朱莉娅意识到汤姆轻轻地摇了摇头，虽然她没有看到他的动作。她的感觉在那一刻非常敏锐，她把这段无声的对话转化成了语言。

“演出结束后一起吃晚餐吗？”

“不，可恶，我去不了，我得送她回家。”

朱莉娅表情严肃地听完了第三幕，由于那是一出严肃的剧目，倒也符合。演出全部结束后，一个苍白的、疲惫不堪的作者结结巴巴地讲了一番话，汤姆则问她晚上想去哪里吃晚饭。

“我们回家吧，聊一聊。”她说道，“如果你饿了，我确信厨房里有你能吃的东西。”

“你是说斯坦霍普广场吗？”

“是的。”

“好吧。”

她感觉到，他为她不想回公寓而松了一口气。在车里的时候，他沉默不语，她知道他同她一起回去不高兴。她猜，可能有什么人举行晚宴，艾维斯·克赖顿会去参加，汤姆也想过去。当他们回到家时，房子又暗又空。仆人们都上床休息了。朱莉娅建议他们应该去地下室找点吃的。

“除非你想吃，我并不想吃什么。”他说道，“我喝一杯威士忌苏打就好，然后就去休息了。明天办公室工作很繁重。”

“好的。拿到会客厅来吧，我去开灯。”

当他上来的时候，她正对着镜子化妆，直到他倒好威士忌，坐了下来，她才停下来，转过身。他看起来非常年轻，魅力四射，穿着他那身漂亮的衣服，坐在那个大大的扶手椅里，于是，那晚她感到的所有痛苦，过去几天吞噬了她的嫉妒心，顿时消散在她的激情中。她坐在他椅子的扶手上，充满爱意地抚摸他的头发。他生气地把身子往后缩。

“别这么做，”他说道，“我讨厌头发被弄乱。”

这好像一把刀刺进她的心脏。他从未用这种语气跟她说过话。但她轻轻地笑了笑，站起身来，端着他为她倒的威士忌，坐到了他对面的椅子里。他做出的动作，说的话，都是出于本能的，他有些窘迫。他躲闪她的目光，脸上再次显现郁郁不乐的神情。这一刻是决定性的。有一阵子，他俩都保持了沉默。朱莉娅的心脏痛苦地跳着，但最后，她强迫自己说话。

“告诉我，”她微笑着说道，“你跟艾维斯·克赖顿上床了吗？”

“当然没有。”他大喊道。

“为什么没有？她很漂亮。”

“她不是那种女孩。我尊敬她。”

朱莉娅没有让自己的任何感情表露在脸上。她的举止非常随意；她可能是在谈论古今帝国的衰亡或帝王的逝世。

“你知道我本该说什么吗？我该说你疯狂地爱着她。”他仍旧不肯直视她的眼睛。“有可能你们已经订婚了吗？”

“不。”

他现在看着她，但那双眼睛充满敌意。

“你向她求过婚吗？”

“我能吗？像我这样一个该死的浑蛋。”

他说得如此愤慨，让朱莉娅感到惊讶。

“你什么意思？”

“兜圈子有什么意思？我怎么能让一个正派的女孩嫁给我？我就是个被包养的男孩，上帝知道，你当然明白。”

“别犯蠢了。我不过送了你几件礼物，有什么可大惊小怪的。”

“我不应该接受。我一直知道这是错误的。这一切不知不觉，直到我陷入其中了才意识到发生了什么。我负担不起你让我过上的生活；经济上捉襟见肘。我不得不从你那儿拿钱。”

“为什么不？毕竟，我是个很有钱的女人。”

“你那该死的钱。”

他双手捧着一个玻璃杯，一时冲动之下将它摔在了壁炉里。那杯子四分五裂。

“你没必要破坏这个快乐的家。”朱莉娅嘲讽地说道。

“对不起。这不是我的本意。”他坐回到他的椅子里，把头扭向一边，“我对自己感到羞愧。失去自尊不是什么好事。”

朱莉娅犹豫了一下。她不知道该说什么。

“你遇到困难的时候，帮助你一下看起来非常顺理成章。对我来说是件乐事。”

“我知道，你这方面做得很老练。你几乎让我相信让你为我还债是我在给你帮忙。你让我轻易地变成个无赖。”

“很遗憾你会这么认为。”

她语气酸溜溜的。她开始觉得有点生气了。

“没什么值得你遗憾的。你想要我，你收买了我。如果我那么下贱，允许自己被收买，这跟你没什么关系。”

“你有这种感觉多久了？”

“从一开始。”

“这不是真的。”

她知道，让他良心觉醒的是他对那位他自以为纯洁的姑娘产生了爱情。可怜的蠢货！难道他不知道，如果艾维丝·克赖顿认为一个助理舞台监督可以给她弄到一个角色，她就会跟他睡觉吗？

“如果你爱上艾维斯·克赖顿，你为什么不告诉我？”他痛苦地看着她，但没有回答。“你害怕这会夺走她在新剧中表演的机会？你现在应该足够了解我了，我不会让感情上的事情妨碍剧院业务的。”

他几乎不相信他的耳朵。

“你这是什么意思？”

“我觉得她的确是个新秀。我会告诉迈克尔，我觉得她会演得很好。”

“哦，朱莉娅，你真够朋友。我从不知道你是这么非同寻常的女人。”

“你早该直接问我，我会告诉你的。”

他舒了口气。

“我亲爱的，我太喜欢你了。”

“我知道，我也非常喜欢你。跟你一起四处瞎逛很有趣，你又总是打扮得很漂亮，对任何女人来讲你都是她们的荣耀。我喜欢和你上床，我觉得你也喜欢和我上床。但是让我们面对现实吧，我可从来没有爱过你，正像你从来没有爱过我一样。我知道这事长久不了。你迟早一定会恋爱，那时我们的事就完了。现在你堕入情网了吧，是不是？”

“是的。”

她决定让他说出口，但当他真的说出来的时候，这话给她的痛是致命的。然而，她依旧好性子地微笑着，“我们一起过了不少快乐的时光，但你不觉得现在我们应该结束了吗？”

她说得如此自然，几乎像是在开玩笑，没人能猜到她内心的痛苦已经到了无法忍受的地步。她胆战心惊地等着他的回答。

“我非常抱歉，朱莉娅；我必须重获我的自尊。”他不安地看着她，“你没有生我的气吧？”

“因为你将你那易变的感情从我身上转移到艾维斯·克赖顿身上吗？”她的眼睛里跳跃着淘气的笑影，“我亲爱的，当然没有。毕竟，你所爱的人还是这个圈子里的。”

“我非常感激你为我做的一切。我不希望你认为我忘恩负义。”

“哦，我的小宠物，别说胡话了。我没有为你做什么。”她站起身，“现在，你必须得离开了。明天你工作繁忙，而我现在累坏了。”

汤姆心里卸下了一块重石。但他对此也并没有很开心，他对她如此友好但同时又有些嘲讽的语气感到困惑；他感到有点沮丧。他走上前与她吻别。她犹豫了一刹那，然后带着友好的微笑，凑上一边面颊给他亲吻，接着又凑上另一边。

“你自己可以出去，对吧？”她把手搭在嘴边以掩饰精心设计的哈欠，“哦，我太困了。”

汤姆离开后，朱莉娅立刻关掉灯，走向窗边。她谨慎地从窗帘缝隙中向外观望。她听到他关上了房子的大门，看到他走了出去。他左右看看。她立刻猜到他在找出租车。眼前一辆车都没有，他开始向公园的方向走去。她知道，他要去参加晚宴聚会和艾维斯·克赖顿会合，并告诉她这个好消息。朱莉娅一屁股坐到一把椅子里。她演了一场戏，演得好极了，现在她筋疲力尽。眼泪，没人能看到的眼泪顺着脸颊流下来。她非常不开心。只有一件事情能让她忍受她的不幸，那就是她对这个为了一个甚至都不知如何演戏的小角色女演员而放弃她的愚蠢男孩所产生的冷冷的鄙夷。真是荒唐。这个小角色不仅不会利用她的双手，连如何穿行过舞台都不明白。

“如果我有一点幽默感，我非得笑掉我的大牙，”她大声说道，“这是我听过的最有趣的笑话。”

她想着汤姆以后要怎么办。那套公寓的租金到季度结算日就到期了。里面有许多东西都属于她。他不会想再回到塔维斯托克广场的客厅兼卧室的公寓了。她想到他通过她结交的那些朋友。他善于利用他们。他们发现他有用处，他就可以跟他们保持关系。但要带着艾维斯对他来说就不那么容易了。艾维斯是一个铁石心肠、唯利是图的小东西，朱莉娅对此非常确定，当他的钱花得不那么痛快的时候，她就不会那么在乎他了。这个笨蛋竟然会被她的假贞洁吸引！朱莉娅知道这种类型的女人。很明显，她仅仅是在利用汤姆得到西登斯剧院的角色，当她拿到角色的时候，她就会把他抛到九霄云外。想到这点，朱莉娅跳起来。她答应了汤姆，艾维斯会拿到《当今时代》里的一个角色，因为这角色出现在朱莉娅演的那场里，但她并没有对自己的承诺太当真。还得迈克尔才能做最后的决定。

“上帝，她会得到那个角色。”她大声说道，不怀好意地笑起来，“天知道，我是个好性子的女人，但凡事都有个度。”

她想到将要扭转汤姆和艾维斯·克赖顿的局面，不禁感到得意。她狞笑着坐在黑暗里，策划如何实施此事。但时不时她会再次开始哭泣，因为她的潜意识里不断涌现着那些极为痛苦的回忆。汤姆苗条青春的肉体贴着她，他温暖赤裸的身子，还有他嘴唇特有的感觉，他的微笑，既羞怯又调皮，还有他鬈发的味道。

“我要不是笨蛋，我就什么都不说。如今我应该了解他了。他只是一时迷恋。他会醒悟过来，然后如饥似渴地重新回到我身边来。”

现在，她疲惫不堪，于是站起身来，上床去睡了。她服了些安眠药。

第二十二章


第二天六点，朱莉娅一醒来就开始想念汤姆。她回忆她对汤姆说的一切，以及他对她说的一切。她感到厌烦又不快。唯一的安慰便是她淡漠轻松地处理了他们的关系破裂这件事，他不会猜到他让她多么痛苦。

整整一天她都非常难过，无法思考其他事情，她因为自己无法停止想念汤姆而生自己的闷气。如果她能将自己的痛苦和一个朋友倾诉一下，也不至于像现在这样难以忍受。她想要有人来安慰她，有人来告诉她，汤姆根本不值得她挂念，并且让她确信汤姆对她非常不好。以往她会向查尔斯或多莉倾诉。查尔斯当然会给予她所有想要的同情，但这对他打击太大，毕竟，他已经深爱了她二十年，如果告诉他，她将他乐意牺牲十年生命而换来的东西给了一个资质平平的年轻人，这太残酷了。她是他的理想女人，粉碎了这个形象她就太无情了。此刻，能得到如此高贵、有教养、优雅、爱她爱得至死不渝的查尔斯·泰默利的安慰一定会让她好过许多。当然，如果她向多莉吐露心声，多莉会觉得受宠若惊。近来她们没怎么见面，但朱莉娅知道，只要她给多莉打电话，多莉就会过来。即使多莉已经猜到了事实，但当朱莉娅和盘托出后，多莉也会被震惊并感到嫉妒，同时感谢一切都已经结束了，多莉会原谅她。将汤姆碎尸万段对她俩来说都是种安慰。当然，承认汤姆玩弄了她不是什么光彩的事，多莉很精明，她不可能被朱莉娅对汤姆说的那些谎话糊弄。她想对着什么人大哭一场，但如果是她主动选择结束，也就没有哭的理由。这将使多莉赢得一分，而且无论多莉怎样同情，你总不能对人性抱有奢望，以为她真会因朱莉娅的威风受挫而感到遗憾。多莉一向崇拜她。朱莉娅不愿让她窥见自己的弱点。

“看起来唯一能选择的人就只有迈克尔了，”她咯咯地笑着说，“但我想这也不行。”

她知道他会怎么说。

“我亲爱的姑娘，我真的不应该是你这种故事的倾诉对象。该死，你把我放在一个非常尴尬的位置。我自觉我是一个胸襟开阔的人，我或许是个演员，但说到底我是个绅士，我的意思，我的意思是，这事儿太不堪了。”

直到下午迈克尔才回到家，当他进入朱莉娅的房间时，她正在休息。他告诉她有关他周末的事情，以及他的比赛结果。他打得很好，有几局挽回得很出色，他把挽回的情形讲得非常详细。

“顺便问一句，昨晚你去看的那个女孩怎么样？她演得好吗？”

“我确实这么认为，你知道。她很漂亮。你肯定会喜欢上她。”

“哦，我亲爱的，在我这个年纪，不会喜欢上什么人了。她有演技吗？”

“当然，她缺乏经验，但我觉得她有天赋。”

“哦，好吧，我最好让她来一下，亲自看一看。我怎么能联系到她？”

“汤姆有她的地址。”

“那我现在就打给他。”

他拿起电话，拨通了汤姆的号码。汤姆接了电话，迈克尔把地址写在一张纸上。

对话仍在继续。

“哦，我的老伙计，很遗憾听到这消息。运气太差了！”

“怎么了？”朱莉娅问道。

他让她别说话。

“好吧，我不想对你太严格。别担心。我确定我们能想出个让你满意的安排。”他用手捂住话筒，转向朱莉娅，“我要邀请他下周日来吃晚餐吗？”

“如果你想的话。”

“朱莉娅说，周日你能来一起吃晚餐吗？哦，真遗憾。好吧，再见，老朋友。”

他挂掉了电话。

“他有约会。这个小流氓跟那女孩有一腿？”

“他跟我保证没有。他尊重她。她是个上校的女儿。”

“哦，她是个淑女。”

“我竟然不知道他俩有牵连，”朱莉娅尖酸地说道，“你刚才跟他在说什么？”

“他说他们给他减了工资。市场不景气。他不想租那套公寓了。”朱莉娅的心脏突然一阵狂跳。“我让他别担心。我会让他免费住着直到行情好转。”

“我不知道你为什么要这么做。毕竟，这纯粹是生意上的安排。”

“对像他那样的年轻家伙来讲，运气实在不好。而且你知道他对我们有用；如果我们宴会差一个人的话，总是可以招呼他过来，而且当我想让人陪着打高尔夫的时候，他就在附近，这很方便。一个季度就二十五英镑而已。”

“我真想不到你这个人竟会这样盲目地慷慨起来。”

“哦，别担心，我会失之东隅，收之桑榆的。”

此时，女按摩师到了，他们的对话就此结束。朱莉娅庆幸不久就会去剧院，可以暂时结束漫漫一日的痛苦；当她从剧院返回家里时，会再喝一点安眠药水，从而获得几个小时的短暂遗忘。她觉得几天后最痛苦的时期就会过去了；最重要的是咬紧牙关挺过这段时间。她必须分散一下自己的注意力。当她出门前往剧院时，她让男仆打电话给查尔斯·泰默利，看他明天是否有空陪她在丽兹饭店共进午餐。

午餐的时候查尔斯异常殷勤。他的仪表、举止都彰显着他属于不同于汤姆的世界，顿时，她对去年因为汤姆而进入的圈子感到一阵厌恶。他谈论政治、艺术和书籍；于是，她的灵魂平静下来。她对汤姆只是一时迷恋，她现在明白那是害人的；她打算从那段感情中逃离出来。她打起精神。她不想一个人待着，她知道即使午餐后她回到家中也无法入睡，于是她问查尔斯能否带她去国家美术馆。这让查尔斯感到莫大的愉悦；他喜欢谈论画，并且讲得头头是道。这让他们回到她在伦敦初露头角的旧时光，那时他们一起共度了许多下午时光，在公园里漫步，或是在博物馆里闲逛。第二天，她有日场表演，之后一天她参加了午餐聚会，而当他们分开时又约定周五一起午餐，然后去泰特美术馆。

几天后，迈克尔告诉她，他已经聘用了艾维斯·克赖顿。

“她的长相满足角色需求，这一点毫无疑问，她会和你形成鲜明的对比。我是听了你的推荐才录用她的。”

第二天早晨，仆人从地下室打电话上来说有芬内尔先生的电话。她的心脏似乎停止了跳动。

“把电话接上来。”

“朱莉娅，我要告诉你，迈克尔聘用了艾维斯。”

“是的，我知道。”

“他对艾维斯说是听了你的推荐才聘用她的。你太够义气了。”

这会儿朱莉娅的心跳剧烈地加快了，她竭力控制住自己的声音。

“哦，别说傻话啦，”她欢欣地回答，“我早对你说没问题的。”

“我很高兴这一切都定下来了。她基于我告诉她的情况，已经接受了那个角色。一般情况下她不读剧本是不会接受任何角色的。”

朱莉娅听到汤姆这样说的时候，幸亏汤姆没有看到此刻她的脸。她本想尖刻地回答，聘用这种小角色演员时从来不会让他们读剧本，但她温柔地说道：

“好吧，我觉得她会喜欢的，难道你不这么认为？那是很不错的角色。”

“而且你知道，她会尽全力演好这个角色的。我相信她会引起轰动的。”

朱莉娅深吸一口气。

“太棒了，不是吗？我是说，这个角色可能让她成名。”

“是的，我已经跟她说了这些。我说，我什么时候再去见你？”

“我会打电话给你，好吗？太可恶了，接下来几天我的日程全部都是约会。”

“你不会丢下我就因为……”

她发出一阵低沉而沙哑的笑声，那种让观众很开心的笑声。

“别犯傻。哦，上帝，我的浴缸正在放水。我必须去看看。再见，我亲爱的。”

她放下电话。他的声音！她内心的痛苦简直无法忍受。她坐在床上，在痛苦中来回晃着身子。

“我该怎么做？我该怎么做？”

她以为她已经过了这道坎，但刚才那通简短愚蠢的对话表明，她对他的爱没有丝毫减弱。她想要他。她一天到晚无时无刻不在思念他。她不能没有他。

“我可能永远忘不掉他了。”她哀号道。

剧院再一次成为她唯一的庇护所。让人觉得讽刺的是，她正在演的戏里最精彩的那一场，也是让这部戏获得成功的那一场，正是两个情人的分手戏。他们出于责任感而分手；而朱莉娅，在剧中，为了正义而牺牲了她的爱，她获得幸福的希望以及她所热爱的一切。这是一场从一开始就非常吸引她的戏。她演得感人至深。她把她精神中所有的痛苦之情都置于这场戏的表演中；她所演的不再是一个伤心的角色，而是她自己的。在现实生活中，她竭力遏制这种非常可笑的激情，这爱情配不上她这样的女人，她强迫自己尽量不去想这个给她带来严重创伤的穷小子；但当她演这段戏的时候就放任自己。她丝毫没有控制自己的痛苦。她对自己失去的感到绝望，她对演她情人的男人所倾注的爱是她对汤姆仍旧怀有的狂热而炽烈的爱。剧中的女主角面临的空虚生活的前景正是她自己的空虚生活的前景。但至少让人安慰的是，她感到自己从未演得如此美妙动人。

“我的天，能展现这样的表演，所受的痛苦也值了。”

她从未这样多地将自我融入一个角色。

一两周后的一晚，她在演出结束后回到化妆间，因她刚刚所表达的情感而筋疲力尽，同时又因无数次的返场谢幕而感到扬扬得意，她发现迈克尔在那儿坐着。

“哈喽？你刚才不会也在观看吧？”

“是的。”

“但你两三天前刚看过。”

“是的，我已经连看了四个晚上了。”

她开始脱衣服。迈克尔从椅子上起身，在房间里来回走动。朱莉娅看了他一眼，发现他微微皱着眉头。

“怎么了？”

“那正是我想知道的。”

她心里一惊，脑子里闪过迈克尔可能听到了更多关于汤姆和她的流言的念头。

“伊维为什么不在这里？”她问道。

“我让她出去了。我有些事情要跟你说，朱莉娅。你大发脾气有什么用？你得听我说。”

一阵冷战刺痛她的脊梁。

“好吧，你想说什么？”

“我听到了一些事情，我想我最好自己来看看。起初我以为只是个意外。因此在我确定之前什么都没说。你怎么了，朱莉娅？”

“我怎么了？”

“是的。为什么你表演得这么糟糕？”

“我？”朱莉娅完全没有想到迈克尔会跟她说这个。她满眼怒火地看着迈克尔，“你可真笨，我从未演得像现在这样好过。”

“胡扯。你演得糟糕透了。”

当然，听到他说的是她的演技后，朱莉娅松了口气，但迈克尔所说的太可笑了，即使她感到非常愤怒，也不由得大笑。

“你这该死的白痴，你根本不知道你在说什么。哼，关于表演，我不知道的都是不值得我去知道的东西；你知道的都是拜我所赐。如果你还算个说得过去的演员的话，那也得归功于我。毕竟，‘布丁好不好，吃了才知道’。你晓得我今天谢幕多少次？这部戏演到现在，还从没这样精彩过。”

“这些我全知道。观众都是些蠢货。如果你大喊大叫，手舞足蹈，总会有一堆可恶的傻瓜朝你愚蠢地喊来喊去。过去四个晚上，你所进行的就是假模假式的游说表演。从头到尾都太假了。”

“太假了？但我对剧中的台词每个字都深有体会。”

“我不管你的感受是什么，你并没有在表现它们。你的表演一团乱。你在夸张；你演过了；你的表演一刻都不能让人信服。这简直是我一生中看到的最糟糕最过火的表演。”

“你太让人讨厌了，你怎么敢这么说我？你才是假模假式的演员。”

她张开手，重重地给了迈克尔一巴掌。他笑了。

“你可以打我，你可以骂我，你可以喊破喉咙，但事实是你的表演烂到地狱了。我不打算以你现在的表演开始彩排《当今时代》。”

“那你去找一个能演得比我更好的人来彩排吧。”

“别犯傻，朱莉娅。我自己可能不是个好演员，我也从来没有这么认为过，但我分得清好的表演和坏的表演。而且，我对你再了解不过了。我打算星期六张贴布告，然后我想让你出国。我们会在秋季的时候推出《当今时代》。”

迈克尔沉静坚定的语气让朱莉娅平静下来。确实，当说到演戏，迈克尔知道有关朱莉娅的一切。

“我演得真的那么糟吗？”

“非常糟。”

她思索了一下。她知道哪里出了问题。她让自己的感情随她一起放逐；她是在感受而不是在演戏。又是一阵寒战贯穿她的脊梁。这是个严重问题。心碎无所谓，但是不能让破碎的心来影响演戏……不，不，不。这是两码事。她的表演比世界上任何一桩恋爱都更重要。

“我会试着控制我自己。”

“强迫自己也没什么用。你太累了。是我的错，我早就应该带你去度假。你需要的就是好好休息。”

“剧院怎么办？”

“如果不能把它租出去，我会重新上演一部我能出演的剧，比如《红桃是王牌》。你总是讨厌那部剧里你的角色。”

“所有人都说这个演出季会非常棒。没有我的演员阵容，你休想一部旧剧能有多大成功；你一分钱都挣不到。”

“我一点都不在乎。唯一要紧的就是你的健康。”

“哦，上帝，请不要再这么宽容了，”她喊道，“我承受不起。”

突然间，朱莉娅哭了起来。

“亲爱的。”

迈克尔抱着朱莉娅，让她和自己并排坐在沙发上。她绝望地紧紧抱着迈克尔。

“你对我太好了，迈克尔，我恨自己。我太坏了，我是个荡妇，我是个可恶的婊子。我从里到外都糟糕透了。”

“就算你说的都是对的，”迈克尔微笑道，“但这掩盖不了你是个好演员的事实。”

“我不知道你是怎么做到对我如此耐心。我待你太卑鄙无耻了。你待我太好了，而我却无情地牺牲了你。”

“现在，宝贝，别再说你以后会后悔的话了。下次我就会提起它们与你作对。”

他的温柔融化了她，她为自己这么多年来觉得他无聊至极而狠狠责骂自己。

“感谢上帝，我拥有你。没了你我该怎么办？”

“你不会没有我的。”

他紧紧地抱着她，虽然她还在哭泣，但已开始感到慰藉。

“很抱歉刚才对你那么恶劣。”

“哦，亲爱的。”

“你真的觉得我是个假模假式的女演员？”

“哦，亲爱的，杜丝都没法跟你相提并论。”

“你真的那么认为？给我你的小手帕。你从来没见过萨拉·伯恩哈特的戏，是不是？”

“是的，没有。”

“她欢嚷吵闹得可厉害呢。”

他们默默地坐了一会儿，朱莉娅渐渐地平静下来。她的心里充满了对迈克尔深沉的爱。

“你依然是全英国最好看的男人，”最后她喃喃说道，“谁也不能让我改变这个想法。”

她感到迈克尔缩回了肚皮，挺起了他的下巴，这在她看来非常可爱、动人。

“你说得很对。我很累。我情绪不好，苦不堪言。我只觉得心里一片空虚。唯一的办法是走开一阵。”





第二十三章


朱莉娅打定主意后，轻松起来。想到可以立即逃离折磨着她的痛苦，这让她觉得一切变得容易忍受。布告张贴出来了；迈克尔召集重演《红桃是王牌》的演员班底开始排练。朱莉娅闲坐在剧院座位上，充满趣味地看着参加重演的女演员表演她几年前曾经演过的角色。在她刚刚开始舞台生涯时，坐在熄了灯的、套着防尘套的剧场里，观看一个个剧中人物由演员演出来，那种激动迄今没有消失。仅仅是在剧院中就让她平静；没有什么地方能更让她感到快乐。观看排练让她放松下来，因此晚上上台表演的时候她感觉自己焕然一新。她意识到迈克尔说的都是真的。她控制住了自己，将自己的私人感情埋藏在意识背后，才能获得对角色的把控，于是她再次展现了自己精湛的演技。她的表演不再是用来发泄她个人的情感，而是又重现她创作的天赋。对表演重获驾驭之力让她感到暗暗欢喜，这给予她一种力量和自由的感觉。

但是这种成功的努力使她精疲力竭，当她不在剧院的时候，只觉得百无聊赖，灰心丧气。她丢失了那旺盛的生命力。一种新的羞耻感打败了她。她觉得自己过气了。她叹息着对自己说没有人再需要她了。迈克尔建议她应该去维也纳和罗杰待一阵子，虽然她喜欢这样的安排，但还是摇摇头。

“我只会影响他的生活方式。”

她担心罗杰会讨厌她。他正在享受自己的生活，而她只会挡了他的路。她无法忍受罗杰会觉得带她四处去逛或者时不时与她共进午餐或晚餐是一件令人厌烦又不得不做的事情。他应该和他的同龄朋友一起开心地玩。她决定去和她母亲住几日。兰伯特太太——迈克尔总是坚持称呼她为德·兰伯特夫人——已经和她的妹妹法卢夫人在圣马洛住了许多年了。每年兰伯特太太会去伦敦和朱莉娅住上几天，但今年因为身体原因没有成行。她已经是个七十多岁的老太太了，朱莉娅知道她会非常乐意自己的女儿陪她住上一段时日。在维也纳，有谁会在乎一个英国女演员？在那儿，她就是个普通人。但在圣马洛，她将是一个引人注目的人物，那两位老太太可以拿她在她们的朋友们面前得意地献宝，倒也有趣。

“我的女儿，英国最伟大的女演员”，以及诸如此类的话。

可怜的老姑娘，她们活不了太久了，过着单调无趣的生活。当然，对朱莉娅来说会非常无聊，但对她们来说会是个盛会。朱莉娅有种感觉，也许在她辉煌而成功的事业中多少忽视了她的母亲。此次她可以做些弥补。她要让自己做到和蔼可亲。她对迈克尔亲切有爱，并始终非常内疚地感到对不起迈克尔。她觉得自己自私傲慢，并想要补偿这一切。她急于做出牺牲，于是写信告知母亲，自己即将前往她那里。

直到离开伦敦的最后一天，她极自然地避开与汤姆相见。上演的戏剧于前一晚闭幕，傍晚她就要起身前往圣马洛了。汤姆六点左右过来和她说再见。迈克尔、多莉、查尔斯·泰默利还有其他一两个人也在，因此汤姆和她也没有机会独处。朱莉娅已经不难跟他自然地进行对话。与他相见并没有让朱莉娅产生令她害怕的那种痛苦，只不过是一阵迟钝的心痛。他们没有对外界公开她离开的时间和地点，剧院的媒体代表也仅仅给几家报纸打了电话，所以朱莉娅和迈克尔到达车站时，车站上只有五六个新闻记者和三个摄影师。朱莉娅和迈克尔分别跟他们说了几句客套话，然后媒体代表把记者带到一旁，并给他们简单介绍了朱莉娅的计划。同时，朱莉娅和迈克尔摆好姿势，让摄影记者在闪光灯的照射下拍摄他们手挽着手、相互吻别的样子。最后，朱莉娅从车厢窗户探出半个身子，将手递给站在站台上的迈克尔。

“这群人太讨厌了，”她说道，“简直没办法逃开他们。”

“我不明白他们是怎么知道你要离开的。”

看到这景象而聚集过来的一小群人跟他们礼貌地保持着一定的距离。媒体代表走过来跟迈克尔说，他觉得记者得到的信息够写一篇专栏了。火车驶出了车站。

朱莉娅拒绝带着伊维一起去。她觉得，若想重获平静，她必须与旧日的生活彻底分割开。伊维在那个法国家庭中会格格不入。对于法卢夫人，也就是朱莉娅的嘉莉姨妈，在她是小姑娘的时候就嫁了一个法国人，现在已是个很老很老的老太太，法语说得比英语还顺口。她丈夫去世多年，她唯一的儿子战死疆场。她住在山上一幢高耸狭窄的石头房子里，当你穿过鹅卵石的街道跨入这门槛，就进入了宁静的过去时代。半个世纪以来这里一切都没有变化。画室摆了一套路易十五风格的家具，套着罩子，这些罩子一个月只拿掉一次，为了小心翼翼地刷一刷下面的丝绸。水晶灯用棉布包着，防止苍蝇叮。壁炉架前是用孔雀毛精巧地编成的火炉栏，用玻璃挡着。虽然这屋子从来不用，但嘉莉姨妈每日都亲自打扫。餐厅镶有护壁板，这里的椅子也罩着防尘罩。餐具柜上搁着一个银饰架、一个银咖啡壶、一个银茶壶和一只银盘子。嘉莉姨妈和朱莉娅的母亲——兰伯特太太——同住在一间晨室，这是间细长狭窄的屋子，布置着法兰西帝国时代的家具。墙上挂着椭圆形的画，是嘉莉姨妈和她已故丈夫的油画像，还有他父母亲的油画像，还有一幅她已故的儿子小时候的彩色画像。她们在这儿做针线活儿，看报纸，读天主教的《十字架报》《两个世界评论报》和当地的日报，晚上在这里玩多米诺骨牌。除了周四晚上，神父和拉加尔德舰长——一位退伍的海军军官——来共进晚餐外，她们还在这里吃饭；但是朱莉娅来了以后，她们决定在餐室里吃饭比较方便。

嘉莉姨妈还在为她的丈夫和儿子服丧。她穿着亲自编织的那件黑色小毛衣，很少有热得穿不住的时候。兰伯特太太也穿着黑色丧服，可是当神父先生和舰长来吃晚饭时，她会在肩上披上一条朱莉娅送给她的网眼白围巾。晚饭过后，他们会玩普拉丰牌戏，输赢以一百分两苏计算。兰伯特太太因为在泽西岛住过多年，现在依旧去伦敦，知道外面世界的情况，她说有种叫约定桥牌的游戏很流行，但是舰长说这游戏很适合美国人，他玩普拉丰就足够了，神父说他觉得惠斯特没人玩了很可惜。然而，男人们从来不满足于自己拥有的；他们总是想要变化，变化，变化。

每个圣诞节朱莉娅都会给她母亲和姨妈贵重的礼物，但她们从未使用过。她们把这些来自伦敦的可贵礼物骄傲地展现给她们的朋友，然后用棉纸包好，存放在橱柜之中。朱莉娅本想给她母亲买辆车，但被拒绝了。她们极少出门，出门也可步行；若有司机，她们还需担心司机会偷她们的汽油。如果让司机在外面吃饭，她们担心会让她们破产；如果让司机在家里吃饭，这会让安妮塔心神不安。安妮塔是她们的厨子、管家兼女仆。她已经在嘉莉姨妈身边陪伴了三十五年。她的侄女安琪儿会帮着干些粗活儿，但安琪儿很年轻，她还不到四十岁，因此，屋里总有一个男人在场不大妥当。

她们让朱莉娅就住在她上学时在嘉莉姨妈家住的那间屋子里。这屋子让她产生一种奇特的令人心碎的感觉，颇让她感动。然而她很快就适应了这里的生活。嘉莉姨妈出嫁后就变成了一个天主教徒，兰伯特夫人在其丈夫去世后在圣马洛安定下来，接受了神父的指导，没过太久也成了信徒。这两位老夫人很虔诚。她们每天早晨同去望弥撒，星期日参加大弥撒。此外，她们极少出门。若出门也是礼节性地去拜访某位家中有亲人去世或者有孙子孙女订婚的老太太。她们读报纸、杂志，为了慈善做很多针线活儿，玩多米诺骨牌，听听朱莉娅送给她们的收音机。虽然神父和舰长每周四与她们共进晚餐的习惯持续了许多年，但每到这一天她们仍旧十分惶恐。这位舰长有水手的心直口快，她们对此不以为奇，若有什么东西烹调得不合他口味，他会毫不犹豫地说出来，甚至连那神父，尽管他是个圣人，也有喜欢吃的和不喜欢吃的。例如，他很喜欢诺曼底板鱼，但他坚持要用最好的黄油来烹饪，而这种黄油在战后价格十分昂贵。每个周四早晨，嘉莉姨妈会从她暗藏钥匙的地方拿出地窖钥匙，亲自从地窖里拿出一瓶红葡萄酒。她们姐妹会在一周内把剩余的酒喝完。

她们对朱莉娅关心备至。她们为她准备了草药茶，竭力不让她坐在可能有穿堂风的地方。事实上，她们一生的一大部分时间都致力于避免穿堂风了。她们让她躺在沙发上，并焦虑地让她遮住自己的脚。她们同她理论她穿的衣服。那些丝袜太薄，一眼就能看穿；那她贴身穿着什么？如果嘉莉姨妈发现她光穿着一件无袖的宽松内衣，也会毫不惊奇。

“她连那个都没穿。”兰伯特夫人说道。

“那她穿了什么？”

“内裤。”朱莉娅说。

“总还戴着胸罩吧，我想。”

“当然没有。”朱莉娅尖刻地回答道。

“那侄女，你裙子下面什么都没穿？”

“算是吧。”

“太荒唐了。”嘉莉姨妈说。

“这太不像话了，我的女儿。”兰伯特夫人说道。

“我并不是故作正经，”嘉莉姨妈又说道，“我必须说这可一点都不得体。”

朱莉娅给她们展示了她的衣服，在她到达后的第一个周四，她们一起讨论了她应该穿什么出席晚餐。嘉莉姨妈和兰伯特夫人彼此争论起来。兰伯特夫人认为，既然她女儿带来了晚礼服，她应该穿着，但嘉莉姨妈觉得很没有必要。

“以前我去泽西看你的时候，我的宝贝，那些绅士来赴晚宴，我记得你会穿一件茶会礼服。”

“当然，茶会礼服会很适合。”

她们充满希望地看着朱莉娅。她摇了摇头。

“用不了太久我就得穿寿衣了。”

嘉莉姨妈穿着一件厚重的高领黑丝裙，戴着一串黑玉珠子，兰伯特夫人也穿了一件类似的，不过她披了一件蕾丝长方披肩，戴了一串人造宝石项链。舰长敦实矮小，满脸皱纹，白发剪得像刷子一般，嘴巴上威风的胡子染成了深黑色。他对朱莉娅很是殷勤，虽然七十多岁了，吃晚饭时还在餐桌底下暗暗碰了她的脚。出去的时候，他抓住机会捏了她的屁股。

“性感。”跟着两个老太太走进客厅时，朱莉娅神气十足地对自己喃喃道。

她们对她大惊小怪，这倒不是因为她是个有名的女演员，而是因为她身体欠佳，需要休息。不久，朱莉娅惊讶地发现，她的名气对她们来说不是什么炫耀的资本，倒成了尴尬之事。她们出去拜访时，都没有主动邀请她，更不用说想要拿她出风头。嘉莉姨妈还一直保持着在泽西养成的下午茶的习惯，从未间断过。一天，在朱莉娅到达不久后，她们邀请了几位太太来喝下午茶，兰伯特夫人午饭时对她女儿说道：

“我的宝贝，我们在圣马洛有一些很不错的朋友，但即使这么多年过去了，她们依旧将我们当成外国人，因此我们不想做什么看起来古怪的事情。很自然，我们也不想让你撒谎，但除非你不得以必须提及此事，你嘉莉姨妈觉得，最好不要向别人说你是个女演员。”

朱莉娅被吓了一跳，但依着她那幽默的秉性，她竟感到想笑。

“如果今天下午我们邀请的朋友之中有哪个碰巧问起你丈夫是做什么的，就说是经商的，这么说也不算不真实，对吧？”

“完全不会。”朱莉娅说道，让自己笑了笑。

“当然我们知道英国女演员和法国的不一样，”嘉莉姨妈善意地说道，“法国女演员有情人已经是心照不宣的事情。”

“哦，我的天。”朱莉娅感叹道。

她在伦敦的日子，还有那里的精彩、得意和痛苦，似乎越来越遥远。不久，她就发现能用平常心态去思考汤姆和她对汤姆的感情了。她认识到，比起她的心，受到更多伤害的是她的虚荣。日子单调地过着。很快，唯一能让她想起伦敦的事情就是周一送来的周日报纸。她拿了一大摞，整日沉浸在阅读中。她感到有点不安。她漫步在城墙上，看着海湾里星罗棋布的小岛。灰色的天空让她思念英国的天空。但到周二早晨，她就又重新沉浸到这种乡下生活的宁静中。她大量地阅读从当地书店买来的小说，英语的、法语的，还有她最爱的魏尔伦。他的诗歌中含有淡淡的忧伤，很适合灰色的布列塔尼镇，很适合那些忧郁的老石头房子，还有那些陡峭弯曲的幽静街道。两位老太太娴静的习惯、平静无事的日常生活还有她们悄声的闲谈，激起她的同情。很多年来她们的生活平淡无奇，直到她们死去也不会再有什么新鲜事发生了，她们的生活是多么没有意义。奇怪的是她们很知足。她们既不知怨恨也不知嫉妒。她们已经达到了朱莉娅站在舞台脚光灯前，向热烈鼓掌的观众鞠躬时所感到的那种超然离群的境界。有时她觉得那种超然是她最珍贵的财富。这种超然于她是来自傲气，于她们则来自屈辱。这两种情况都带来一种弥足珍贵的事情，精神上的自由；只是在这两位老太太身上更为牢固。

迈克尔每周给她写一封简短务实的信，信里他会告诉她西登斯剧院的收入，还有为了下一部剧他所做的准备；但查尔斯·泰默利每天都给她写信。他告诉她伦敦城里的闲话，他以他那迷人、有教养的方式谈论他看过的那些画和他读的那些书。他亲切地引经据典，调皮地显现他的渊博。他进行哲学讨论又不故意卖弄。他告诉她，他爱慕她。那是朱莉娅收到过的最动人的情书，为了传之后世，她决定好好保留。有一天也许会有人将它们出版，人们会去国家肖像美术馆看她那幅由麦克沃伊画的肖像，想到她是这个凄婉动人的爱情故事的女主角而喟叹。

在她离开的头两周里，查尔斯对她尤为亲近，她不知道没了他自己要怎么办。他对她总是有求必应。他同她的对话，带着她进入了一个不同的世界，舒缓了她的神经。她陷入泥潭的灵魂，在他崇高的精神中得到了净化。跟他逛美术馆，看看画，让她安定。她对他极为感激。她回想他爱着她的这么多年，到现在他已经等了她二十多年之久。她待他并不好。若得到她，这会给他带来极大的幸福，而对她而言也没什么伤害。她在想为什么拒绝了他那么久。或许因为他太忠诚，因为他的忠诚太卑微了，或许仅仅因为她想在他心里维持自己的理想形象。这实在是愚蠢的，她太自私了。她突然欣喜地意识到，她终于能对他多年来的温柔耐心和无私忘我予以报答。她并没有忘掉迈克尔十足的关怀在她心中所激起的不相配感，她依旧因为长期对他感到不耐烦而深深懊悔。她离开英国时内心急于自我牺牲的感觉依旧在她胸中急切地燃着烈火。她觉得查尔斯正是值得她奉献自我的对象。一想到当他明白她的意图时的惊讶，她亲切又慈悲地笑了笑；一时间他会几乎不敢相信，之后便是何等的陶醉和狂喜！这么多年来他对她蓄积着的爱将如一股巨大的激流冲破闸门，将她淹没。想到他无限的感激，令她的心膨胀起来。但是他依旧无法相信自己的好运气；当一切结束后，她会躺在他的怀抱里，偎依在他身边，温柔地低语：

“这一切可值得这么多年的等待？”

“像海伦一般，你对我的一吻让我此生永恒(1)。”

能给一个人这么多幸福，真是不可思议。

“离开圣马洛前我会写信给他。”她如此决定了。

春季已过，进入夏季，时间到了七月底，朱莉娅将起程前往巴黎查看她定制的衣服。迈克尔想在九月份上演新剧，排练也会在八月开始。她带着剧本到了圣马洛，想要研习她的角色，但她所居住的环境让她无法如愿。她有空余时间，不过，在那个灰蒙蒙的简朴又舒适的小镇里，在两位兴趣只限于郊区教堂和她们家庭琐事的老人的陪伴下，即便这是一部好剧，她也提不起兴趣。

“是我该回去的时候了，”她说道，“如果我真的认为剧院不值得他们如此大惊小怪，那才真是该死。”

她向母亲和嘉莉姨妈道别。她们对她非常亲切，但她略微感觉到，她们并没有为她的离开而感到遗憾，她离开后她们便可回到被她打断之前的生活。而且，让她们感到欣慰的是再也不会出现不得体的危险了，例如你总是冒着和一个女演员在一起的风险，这可能会引起圣马洛的太太们的非议。

她下午到达巴黎，被领入利兹饭店的套房后，她满意地叹了口气。重回奢华的生活真是一件让人享受的事情。三四个人向她送来了鲜花。她沐浴更衣。一直为她做衣服的查理·德夫里尔已经是她的老朋友了，打电话来说要带她去布洛涅森林吃晚餐。

“我度过了一段很愉快的时光，”她告诉他，“当然对那两位老姑娘来说，有我在身边也非常愉快，但我觉得如果我再多待一天我便成了她们讨厌的人了。”

在这样一个美妙的夜晚，乘车在香榭丽舍大街上行驶，让她内心充满欢悦。她很高兴再次闻到汽油的味道。汽车、出租车、喇叭声、栗树、街灯，路上拥挤的人群，还有咖啡馆外坐着的人们，让人着迷。当他们到达充满欢声笑语、文明而奢华的马德里城堡，再次看到穿着入时、化妆得体的女人和肤色深棕、身穿晚礼服的男人时，她感觉棒极了。

“我觉得自己像流放回来的皇后。”

朱莉娅用了几天的工夫愉快地选购她的衣服，并首次试穿戏服。她每时每刻都享受其中。但她是个个性十足的女人，一旦下了决心必然会坚持到底；在前往伦敦前，她给查尔斯写了封信。他已去过了古德伍德(2)和考斯(3)，在他去往萨尔茨堡(4)前，会在伦敦待上二十四小时。

亲爱的查尔斯：

很快就能见到你真的是太好了。周三我当然有空。我们能一起共进晚餐吗？你还爱我吗？

你的朱莉娅

粘信封时她喃喃道：雪中送炭(5)。这是一句迈克尔被邀请向慈善机构捐款时常常引用的一句拉丁语，通常他会将人们希望他捐款数额的一半邮寄回去。

第二十四章


周三早上，朱莉娅做了美容，烫了头发。对于出席晚餐的服装，她在两条裙子的选择上犹豫不决，一条是极为美丽、让人想起波提切利的《春》的印花蝉翼纱裙，另一条是剪裁优雅、彰显她处女般苗条年轻身形的白色绸缎裙；但当她沐浴时，她决定要穿那件白色绸缎裙：它非常微妙地暗示她想要做出的牺牲是她对迈克尔长期忘恩负义的赎罪。她什么珠宝也没有戴，只戴了一串珍珠项链和一个钻石手镯；除了她的结婚戒指之外，也只有一个镶方形钻石的戒指。她本想把皮肤敷成浅棕色，让自己看起来像个户外女孩，这很适合她，但想到之后她要做的事情，便放弃了这个打算。她无法像将全身涂抹成黑色来饰演奥赛罗的男演员一样，将自己全身都敷成浅棕色。朱莉娅素来是一个准时的女人，当前门打开迎进查尔斯的时候，她正从楼上走下来。她和查尔斯打招呼，眼神中满是温柔，既迷人淘气又亲切无比。查尔斯如今一头稀疏的白发留得很长，随着年事渐高，他那智者的、非同凡响的五官也有些下垂；他有点驼背，衣服看上去似乎需要熨烫。

“真是个奇怪的世界，”朱莉娅想，“男演员极力想看起来像绅士，而绅士则极力打扮得像演员。”

毫无疑问，她对他产生了应有的影响。他给了她完美的开场白。

“为何今夜的你看上去如此可爱？”他问道。

“因为我很期待与你共进晚餐。”

她那一双美丽传情的眼睛注视着他的眼睛。她张开嘴唇，像她在罗姆尼所画的汉密尔顿夫人的肖像画上看到的那样吸引人。

他们在萨瓦(1)进餐。饭店领班带他们坐在临着过道的一张餐桌旁，这样他们就能被人们极好地注意到。虽然此时是外出的季节，然而饭店餐厅依旧坐满了人。朱莉娅向几个她看到的朋友点头微笑。查尔斯有许多话要告诉她；她讨好般兴致勃勃地听着。

“你是世上最好的陪伴，查尔斯。”她告诉他。

他们来得迟了，晚餐吃得很不错，当查尔斯喝完他的白兰地，人们已经开始来吃夜宵了。

“天哪，剧院演出已经结束了？”他说道，看了一眼手表，“每当我和你在一起时，时间总是过得飞快。你觉得他们是不是想赶我们走了？”

“我还一点都不想去睡觉。”

“我想迈克尔此刻要到家了吧？”

“我觉得是。”

“你为什么不来我家，我们聊一聊？”

这就是她所谓的领会暗示。

“我很愿意。”她回答道，语气中添加了一丝她觉得会与她脸蛋儿极其相称的羞涩。

他们上了他的车，向希尔街开去。他领她来到他的书房。书房在底层，向外望出去是一座小花园。法式窗户大开着，他们坐在沙发上。

“关掉一些灯，让夜色进入房间。”朱莉娅说道。她引用了《威尼斯商人》里的台词，“‘正是这么个夜晚，阵阵香风轻轻地摩弄着树叶……’”

查尔斯关掉了所有灯，只留了一盏罩着灯罩的台灯。当他再次坐下来，朱莉娅依偎着他。他用胳膊搂着她的腰，她将头倚在他肩上。

“这就是天堂。”她喃喃道。

“这几个月我太想念你了。”

“你调皮淘气了吗？”

“嗯，我买了安格尔(2)的一幅画，花了不少钱。你走之前我必须得向你展示一下。”

“一定记着。你把它放在哪里了？”

自打进入房间那一刻起，她便在想引诱是发生在书房还是楼上。

“在我卧室。”他回答道。

“那真是舒服多了。”她想。

想到可怜而年迈的查尔斯要玩那样的小伎俩将她带到他的卧室，她便暗暗窃笑。男人都是一些笨蛋！害羞胆怯，这就是他们的毛病。她想到了汤姆，突然一阵剧痛直刺她的心胸。可恶的汤姆。查尔斯果真非常可爱，她下决心要回报他长久的爱慕。

“你一直是我极好的朋友，查尔斯。”她用低沉、略带沙哑的声音说道。她稍稍转过身，这样一来脸贴得他非常近，她的嘴唇，又像汉密尔顿夫人一样，微微张开，“可是我却并没有对你太好。”

她看起来是那么娇柔顺从，像一个等待采撷的成熟桃子，看起来他要不可避免地亲她。然后，她会用她那柔软雪白的胳膊绕住他的脖子。但他仅仅微笑着。

“你千万别这么说。你一直都极好。”

（“他害怕了，可怜的家伙。”）“我觉得没有人像你这样爱过我。”

他轻轻捏了她一把。

“我依旧爱你。你知道。我的生活里没有别的女人。”

鉴于他没有亲吻她献上去的嘴唇，朱莉娅稍稍转了身。她若有所思地看着电火炉。可惜它没有开着。这场合若有火炉就好了。

“如果那时我们一起逃跑，一切会多么不同。嗨哟。”

她从来也没太弄明白“嗨哟”是什么意思，但在舞台上用得很多，并会配上一声叹息，听起来很悲伤。

“英国会失去它最伟大的女演员。我现在知道那时提出此事的我有多自私。”

“成功并非一切。我有时想，是不是在满足我愚蠢的小抱负的时候，耽误了世界上最伟大的事情。毕竟，爱情才是唯一重要的事。”而现在，她又用温柔迷人、空前美丽的眼睛再次看着他，“你知道吗，我想假如我现在能回到过去的年月，我就会说带我走。”

她的手慢慢滑下，握住了他的手。他文雅地捏了捏。

“哦，我的宝贝。”

“我经常想到我们梦想中的别墅。橄榄树、夹竹桃还有蓝色的大海。宁静。有时我惊骇于自己生活的沉闷和粗俗。你那时所提供的是美。现在太迟了，我知道；那时我不知道自己有多在乎你，我从未想过，随着时光逝去，你对我来说越来越重要。”

“听到你说这些真让人开心，我的宝贝。弥补了不知多少。”

“为了你，我愿意做世上的任何事，查尔斯。一直以来我都太自私了。我毁了你的生活，我不知道自己在做什么。”

她的声音低沉，有些发抖，她仰起头，使得她的脖子看起来像白色的柱子。她的露肩装显现出一部分小巧坚实的乳房，她用手把它们略微向前抬起。

“你千万别那么说，你千万不能那么想。”他温柔地回答，“你一直都是完美的。其他样子我也不会喜欢。哦，我的宝贝，人生如此短暂，爱情更是转瞬即逝。而人生的悲剧就在于我们有时能得到我们想要的。而今回顾一下我们在一起的漫长岁月，我知道你比我聪明。‘在你的形体上，岂非萦绕着古老的传说，以绿叶为其边缘？’你记得下一句是什么吗？‘你永远，永远吻不上，虽然够接近了——但也不必心酸；她不会老，虽然你不能如愿以偿。你将永远爱下去，她将永远壮丽！’(3)”

（“白痴。”）“如此美好的诗句，”她叹气道，“可能你是对的。嗨哟。”

他继续背诵，这一伎俩在朱莉娅看来稍显烦人。

啊，幸福的树木！

你的枝叶不会剥落，从不曾离开春天。

幸福的吹笛人也不会停歇，

他的歌曲永远是那么新鲜……



这给了朱莉娅思考的机会。她盯着没开着的火炉，目光专注，好像她被这些绝美的诗词迷住。很明显他并没有理解她的意图。这也不足为奇。二十年了，她对他热情的祈求充耳不闻，因此他已死了这条心也是很自然的。就好像珠穆朗玛峰，如果那些坚忍的登山运动员辛苦地试了那么久，希望到达山顶却徒然，最后却发现有更便捷的道路，他们只会不相信自己的眼睛：他们会以为这里面有圈套。朱莉娅觉得自己需要表达得更明白些；她必须，可以说，伸手拉一把这位疲惫的朝圣者。

“太晚了，”她温柔地说道，“给我看看你的新画，然后我必须得回家了。”

他站起来，她把双手递给他，让他帮她从沙发上站起来。他们上了楼梯。他的睡衣和晨衣整整齐齐地放在椅子上。

“你们单身汉给自己安排得真好。好一间舒适的卧室。”

他把镶框的画从墙上拿了下来，递给她到灯下观赏。这是一幅戴着贝雷帽、穿着灯笼袖低领裙的敦实女人的铅笔肖像。朱莉娅觉得画中的女人普通无奇，那裙子更是可笑。

“真是引人入胜。”她喊道。

“我知道你会喜欢。是一幅好画，不是吗？”

“非常好。”

他将那幅小画放回原处。当他再次转过身来，她站得离床很近，双手放在背后，样子有点像被太监首领带领去给大维齐尔(4)过目的切尔卡西亚奴隶；她的举止有一丝谦逊的回避，一丝令人愉快的羞怯，同时还有处女对即将进入她的王国的期待。朱莉娅叹了一口气，声音性感撩人。

“我的宝贝，这真是一个美妙的夜晚。我从未感到和你如此亲近。”

她慢慢从背后抬起手，精妙自然地抓住时机，将手移到身前，伸出胳膊，双手手心朝上，仿佛无形地捧着一只尊贵豪华的盘子，而在这盘子之上是她奉献上的一颗真心。她美丽的眼睛更显温柔顺从，嘴上带着羞涩屈服的微笑。

她看到查尔斯的微笑冻结在他的脸上。此刻他全都明白了。

（“上帝，他不想要我。这一切都是虚张声势。”）这一启示一时让她不知所措。（“上帝，我怎么摆脱这一切？我现在看起来是多么蠢。”）

她几乎失去了镇定。各种思绪在她脑海中如闪电般闪过。他站在那儿，尴尬地看着她，极力掩饰自己的窘迫。朱莉娅惊慌失措。她不知道该如何处理捧着那只尊贵盘子的双手；上帝知道，那手虽小，但此刻却像是两条羊腿挂在那儿。她更不知道该说什么。每一秒都让她的姿势和处境更加难以忍受。

（“卑鄙小人，肮脏的卑鄙小人。这些年一直在愚弄我。”）

朱莉娅做了唯一能做的，她保持着那个姿势，心里默数着数，以免她走得太快。她把两手渐渐靠拢，直到双手握住，然后将头仰起，再把双手慢慢地抬起，放到了她脖子的一侧。她这个姿势和其他的动作一样可爱，正是这个姿势提醒了她该说什么。她低沉有磁性的声音颤抖而充满感情。

“我很高兴，回顾过去，我们之间没有什么值得懊恼自己的事情。人生之苦并非死亡，而是爱情死去。（她是从某部剧中听到的这句。）如果我们是情人，你早就厌恶我了，那现在我们回望过去就只有对我们自己人性弱点的遗憾了。刚才你说的雪莱关于人变老的诗句是什么？”

“是济慈，”查尔斯纠正道，“‘她不会老，虽然你不能如愿以偿。’”

“对，继续。”

“‘你将永远爱下去，她将永远美丽！’”

她大大地张开双臂，将鬈发向上一甩。她有话说了。

“是真的，不是吗？‘你将永远爱下去，我将永远美丽。’如果为了片刻的疯狂就抛弃掉我们友谊所带来的幸福，我们就是一对傻子。我们没什么可羞愧的。我们很纯洁。我们能够昂首挺胸，直面世人。”

她本能地觉得这是一句退场的台词，于是动作也跟了上来，她高昂着头，退到门口，猛地把门打开。她的力量让她将这种舞台感一路带到楼下。然后，她让这种感觉消散，极其自然地转向跟着她的查尔斯。

“我的斗篷。”

“车在那儿，”为她披斗篷的时候查尔斯说道，“我开车送你回去吧。”

“不，让我自己走吧。我想将这一时刻铭记于心。我走之前亲我一下。”

她将嘴唇向他送去。他亲吻了她的双唇。但她挣出身来，扼制了抽泣，猛地推开大门，向着等在那里的汽车奔去。

当她到家后，站在自己的卧室里，大大地舒了口气。

“可恶的蠢货。想想我竟被如此愚弄。感谢上帝，我脱身得还算可以。他真是个浑蛋，我觉得他没有看出来我的意图。”不过，那个僵硬的微笑让她不安，“他可能有所怀疑，但不会很肯定，之后他一定会觉得自己犯了错。我的天，我讲了什么混账话。不过我得说，这些话被完全接受了。幸亏我及时明白过来。再过一分钟我就会把衣服脱光。那就不能一笑了之了。”

朱莉娅开始窃笑。刚才的情景当然很令人悔恨，他让她看上去像个傻子，但如果你有一丁点儿幽默感，你就会看到其中可笑的一面。没人能分享这事儿让她觉得遗憾；虽然这故事对她不利，但不能否认这是个精彩故事。令她无法释怀的是她竟然将这些年来他上演的一部痴情不悔的喜剧当真了；因为这当然只是一种姿态；他喜欢将自己视为那个忠贞的爱慕者，很明显，他最不想要的就是他的忠贞得到回报。

“欺骗我，他做到了，完全让我上了他的当。”

但一个想法闪现在朱莉娅脑子里，让她停止了微笑。当一个女人热情的献身被一个男人拒绝，她会得出一两个结论：要么他是同性恋，要么他性无能。朱莉娅若有所思地点了一支烟。她问自己，查尔斯是否利用他对自己的深情引开世人对他真正性取向的关注。但她摇了摇头。如果他是同性恋，她一定会有所察觉；毕竟，自打战争结束后，这种事情就成了热门话题。他极有可能是性无能。她想了想他的年纪。可怜的查尔斯，她再次微笑了。如果情况真是这样，处于尴尬甚至可笑位置的就是他，而非她。他一定被吓傻了，可怜的家伙。当然没有哪个男人愿意将此事告诉一个女人，尤其是他疯狂爱着的女人；她越想越觉得这种解释合理。她开始为他感到难过，甚至有些对他充满母亲般的怜悯。

“我知道我要做什么，”她说道，开始脱衣服，“明天我会送一大束白百合给他。”

第二十五章


第二天早晨，朱莉娅醒来后在床上躺了一会儿才拉铃。她思考着，当她想起前一夜的经历，她不由得为自己的沉着应对感到沾沾自喜。当然不能说她是转败为胜，但从战略撤退的角度来看，她的行为称得上技艺精湛。虽然她感到很不自在，但查尔斯独特的行为或许有别的解释。说不定是因为她缺乏魅力。这个念头在昨晚的时候划过她的脑海，虽然当时她认为这是极不可能的，但是不可否认，早晨的时候这个念头又在困扰她。她拉了铃。一般来讲，由于朱莉娅吃早餐的时候迈克尔总会进来，当伊维给她拉起帘子时，会递给她一面镜子和一把梳子，还有她的脂粉和口红。以往，朱莉娅会迅速地梳几下头发，然后用粉扑潦草地在脸上扑点粉，但今天早晨，朱莉娅却费了点心思。她用心地涂了嘴唇，抹了腮红，仔细梳理了头发。

“公允地讲，”她说道，依旧看着镜中的自己，伊维将早餐托盘放到她的床上，“你觉得我是个长相好看的女人吗，伊维？”

“回答这问题前，我得知道这是不是个陷阱。”

“你这个老贱人。”朱莉娅说道。

“你不是什么漂亮女人，你知道。”

“没有哪个伟大的女演员是漂亮的。”

“像你昨晚打扮得那样花枝招展，再加上身体背着光，看起来更糟了，你知道。”

（“这对我一点好处都没有。”）“我想说的是，如果我打定主意想勾搭一个男人，你觉得我能成功吗？”

“就我对男人的了解，这事儿一点也不难。你现在想勾搭谁？”

“没人。我就是泛泛而谈。”

伊维吸了吸鼻涕，食指抠了抠鼻孔。

“别那样吸鼻涕。如果你想擦鼻涕，就擦。”

朱莉娅慢慢地吃着她的煮鸡蛋，沉浸在自己的想法中。她看着伊维，一个长相可笑的老东西，但人不可貌相。

“告诉我，伊维，有男人试图在大街上勾搭过你吗？”

“我？我倒想看他们试试。”

“我跟你说实话吧。有很多女人总是告诉我，男人们是怎样在大街上尾随她们的，如果她们停下站在商店的橱窗前，他们就会上前来，得到她们的注意。有时她们不得不费好大劲才能摆脱他们。”

“真恶心。”

“我不知道。我觉得这很让人受用。你知道，说来也怪，从来没有人在大街上跟随过我。我不记得曾有人试图搭讪我。”

“哦，那你夜里去埃奇韦尔路走一走。一定会被搭讪的。”

“如果真发生了，我不知道应该怎么应对了。”

“叫警察。”伊维面无表情地说。

“我认识一个女孩，她正在朝邦德街的一家帽子商店的橱窗前张望，一个男人走上前来，问她是否想要一顶帽子。她回答说想要，然后他们进了商店，她选了一顶，说了姓名和地址，男人当即付了钱，然后她说‘非常感谢你’，便走出了商店，而那男人还在等着找零钱。”

“这只是她告诉你的故事。”伊维吸了吸鼻涕，很是怀疑。她困惑地看了一眼朱莉娅，“这是什么意思？”

“哦，没什么。我就是没想明白为什么从来没有男人上前来跟我搭讪。我并非没有性吸引力。”

但是，她有吗？她下了决心要对此测试一番。

那个下午，朱莉娅睡完午觉，起来化了比日常浓重的妆，没有叫伊维，自己穿上一件既不普通又不容易看出价格昂贵的连衣裙，戴了一顶红色的宽檐草帽。

“我不想看起来像个妓女，”她看着镜子里的自己说道，“但我也不希望自己看起来太正派。”

她悄悄地走下楼梯，不让人听到她的响动，轻轻地关上门。她有一点紧张，更多的是兴奋；她觉得自己正在做一件让人惊悚的事情。她穿过康诺特广场，进入埃奇韦尔路。时间大约是五点左右。路上车水马龙，到处都是公共汽车、出租车和卡车；骑车的人在车流间穿梭前行，十分危险。人行道上挤满了人。她慢慢地向北边走去。起初，她目视前方，绝不左右张望，但很快她就意识到这样做毫无益处。如果她想引起周围人的注意，就必须朝他们看去。有两三次她看到六个人盯着商店橱窗看，她也停了下来，看着橱窗，但没有人注意到她。她继续向前走去。人们从她身边走过，他们看起来行色匆匆。没人注意到她。当她看到有个男人朝她走来时，她大胆地朝他看了一眼，但那人却面无表情地走了过去。她突然想到自己的表情太严肃了，然后她让嘴角微微挂着一丝笑意。有两三个男人以为她在冲他们微笑，他们很快将目光转移。其中一个男人从她身边经过后，她回头看了一眼，发现那人也正在回头看她，但注意到她的目光后，便匆匆赶路了。她感到有些被冷落了，决定不再四处张望。她继续往前走。以前她总是听说伦敦的人们是世界上最得体的，但这一刻这种得体实在有点不近人情。

“这种情形在巴黎、罗马或者柏林的街道上根本不会发生。”她思索着。

她决定走到马里波恩大街，然后再返回来。如果一次都没有被搭讪就回了家，这也太丢人了。她走得非常慢，以至于路人有时会撞到她。这让她有些恼怒。

“我本该试试牛津街，”她说道，“那个笨蛋伊维。很明显埃奇韦尔路已经很干净了。”

她的心脏突然狂喜地跳了一下。她捕捉到一个年轻男人的眼睛，她确定里面有光芒闪现。他从她身边走过，她竭尽全力才让自己没有转回头去。她惊了一下，因为不一会儿他再次从她身边经过，他竟折返了回来，而这次他正盯着她看。她瞥了他一眼，然后羞涩地朝下看去。他退了回去，她知道他在跟着她。一切都很好。她在一间商店的橱窗前停了下来，朝里看去，他也停了下来。现在她知道该如何表现了。她假装对那些陈列的商品入了迷，但就在她准备离开前又微带笑意地看了他一眼。他个头很矮，看起来像个职员或者商场巡视员，穿一件灰色西装，戴一顶棕色软边呢帽。他不是朱莉娅心中想要勾搭的对象，但事实在这儿摆着，他显然试图要搭讪她。朱莉娅已全然忘记了自己刚刚还觉得疲惫。她不知道接下来会发生什么。当然她不会让事情进展得过于离谱，但她很好奇他下一步要做什么。她在想他会跟她说什么。她既兴奋又开心；心里的负担终于卸了下来。她慢慢地踱步，她知道他紧随其后。她又在一家商店橱窗前停了下来，这次他就站在她身后。她又停在另一家商店的橱窗前，这次他站在了她的身边。她的心开始狂跳不止。这确实开始像一场冒险了。

“他会不会邀请我同他一起去旅店。我觉得他负担不起。电影院。对。会很好玩。”

她面朝他站着，微微带着笑意。他摘下帽子。

“兰伯特小姐，是您吗？”

她差点吓得灵魂出窍。她震惊到无法沉着镇定地予以否认。

“我觉得我看到您那眼就认出您来了，所以我又折返回来确认了一下，我对自己说，看，如果那不是朱莉娅·兰伯特，那我就是拉姆齐·麦克唐纳(1)。然后，您不再向商店橱窗望去，这给了我看清您的机会。我觉得诧异的是在埃奇韦尔路上看到您。这太离奇了，如果您懂我的意思。”

事实可比他想的要离奇得多。不论怎样，如果他知道她是谁，这一切就都不重要了。她本应猜到，在伦敦她走不了多远就会被认出来。他说话带着伦敦东区口音，面色苍白，但朱莉娅报以开心友好的微笑。一定不能让他觉得她在摆架子。

“请原谅我未被介绍就跟您说话，但我不想错过这个机会。您能给我签名吗？”

朱莉娅倒吸了口气。不会就因为这个他跟了她十分钟吧。他肯定是以此为跟她说话的借口。好吧，她可以配合一下。

“我很高兴。但我在大马路上可给你签不好。人们会盯着看。”

“没错。您看，我打算去喝下午茶，下个拐角有一家里昂餐室(2)。为什么不一起喝一杯？”

她继续演戏。当他们喝完茶后，他估计就会建议去看电影了。

“好吧。”她说道。

他们一直走到那家饭店，在一张小桌子前坐了下来。

“两杯茶，小姐，”他说道，“还要什么吃的吗？”朱莉说什么也不要，他又说道：“一客烤饼和黄油，小姐。”

朱莉娅现在终于能好好看看这个男人了。虽然敦实矮小，但他长相不错。他的黑头发涂了发蜡紧贴着头皮，眼睛秀美，但他的牙齿不好，而且他那苍白的皮肤让他看起来很不健康。他的举止中有一丝冒失，让朱莉娅不是很喜欢，但她理智地想了想，你不大可能指望一个在埃奇韦尔路上勾搭你的青年会有紫罗兰那样的腼腆。

“别的慢慢来，先让我们签好名，可以吗？说做就做，这是我的座右铭。”

他从口袋掏出一支钢笔，又从一本鼓鼓的小笔记本里拿出一张大卡片。

“这是我们公司的商业名片，”他说道，“在这上面签就行。”

朱莉娅看他把花招耍到现在，觉得可笑，但她好心情地在卡片后面签了自己的名字。

“你收集签名吗？”她问道，淡淡一笑。

“我？不。我觉得都是胡闹。我女朋友收集。她有查理·卓别林的和道格拉斯·费尔班克斯的，还有其他我根本不认识的。如果你愿意我可以给你看她的照片。”

从他的笔记本里他抽出一张快照，上面是个相当时髦的年轻女郎，像电影明星一样笑着，露出一口牙齿。

“漂亮。”朱莉娅说道。

“当然啦。今晚我们打算去电影院。等我给她看您的签名，她肯定会非常惊喜。当我知道那是您的时候，我对自己说的第一件事就是，我死也要为我的格温拿到朱莉娅·兰伯特的签名。趁着今年八月放假的时候，我们就要结婚了，您知道；我们要去怀特岛度蜜月。有了这个我会跟她好好寻开心。等我告诉她我和您一起喝了茶，她一定不会相信的，她会觉得我在开玩笑，然后我会给她看您的签名，明白吗？”

朱莉娅礼貌地听着，但微笑已经从她脸上消失了。

“恐怕我一会儿得走了，”她说道，“我已经迟到了。”

“我也没有太多时间。您看，要去见我的女朋友，我恨不得立刻离开这里。”

女服务员端来茶的时候就把账单放在了桌子上，当他们起身时，朱莉娅从她包里掏出一个先令。

“您这是做什么？您不会认为我会让您付钱吧。我邀请的您。”

“您太客气了。”

“可是我来告诉您，您能做什么，某天您可以让我带着我女朋友去您剧院的休息室里见您。就跟她握握手，明白吗？这对她来说意义很大。可不是么，她会一辈子念叨这事儿的。”

有那么几分钟，朱莉娅的态度变得很严厉，而现在，虽然依旧优雅，但几乎已经盛气凌人了。

“对不起，但我从来不在后台见陌生人。”

“哦，抱歉。但你不介意我这么问吧？我是说，我并不是为了我自己。”

“不介意。我很理解。”

她冲着一辆沿着马路牙子缓缓驶来的出租车招了招手，然后将手递给这个年轻人。

“再见，兰伯特小姐。再见，祝你好运，祝你一切顺利，还要谢谢你的签名。”

朱莉娅坐在出租车的角落里，恼羞成怒。

“可恶的畜生。他还有他的女朋友。竟敢问是否能带她来见我。”

朱莉娅回到家后，径直上楼去了她的卧室。她一把抓掉头上的帽子，生气地将它扔在床上。她跨步走到穿衣镜前，看着自己。

“老了，老了，老了，”她喃喃道，“毫无办法；我完全没有性吸引力了。你不会相信，是吗？你会说这一切太可笑了。但还有其他的解释吗？我从埃奇韦尔路的这头走到那头，上帝知道我把那角色演得多完美，但没有一个男人对我有一点兴趣，除了一个可恶的商店店员，而他竟然是为了他的女朋友要我的签名。太荒谬了。一群性冷淡的杂种。我真不知道英国的未来在哪里。大英帝国！”

最后几个字她说得充满嘲讽，准能让前座整排的内阁大臣们惊慌失措。她开始做起手势来。

“如果认为我没有性吸引力，还能到达我今天的位置，那简直太可笑了。人们为什么要来看一个女演员？因为他们想跟她上床。难道你要告诉我，即使我没有性吸引力，我也能将一部糟糕的戏剧演上三个月，还场场满座吗？性吸引力到底是什么东西？”

她暂停了一下，若有所思地看着自己。

“当然我能演得性感。我能演任何东西。”

她开始想那些以性感而臭名昭著的女演员，尤其是其中的一位，莉迪亚·梅恩，她总是演荡妇的角色。她算不上一个真正的女演员，但在某些角色上她演得很到位。朱莉娅模仿力极强，现在她开始模仿莉迪亚·梅恩。像莉迪亚那样，她让眼睑淫荡地半掩着眼睛，她的身体在裙子里扭来扭去。她让眼睛流露出莉迪亚那种挑逗的眼神，用蛇一般蠕动的姿势发出诱惑的邀请，这是莉迪亚的专长。她开始用莉迪亚的声音说话，懒洋洋地拖长调子，让每句话听起来都淫荡不堪。

“哦，我亲爱的男人，那种话我听得太多了。我不想在你和你的老婆之间惹什么麻烦。男人们为什么不能让我一个人待会儿呢？”

这是朱莉娅无情讽刺的模仿。真是残忍。她感到非常有趣，大笑了起来。

“好吧，有一件事情，我可能没有性吸引力，但看了我的模仿后，也不会有人觉得莉迪亚有什么性感可言了。”

这让她大感宽慰。

第二十六章


排练开始了，这缓解了朱莉娅深受困扰的情绪。迈克尔在她出国期间重新上演的旧戏目既不成功，也不太糟糕，但比起关掉剧院，他情愿一直上演这出戏，直到《当今时代》可以上演了。因为他一周要演两个日场，天气又热，因此他决定排练不必太过紧张。一个月前他们就开始了排练。

虽然朱莉娅在舞台上演了那么多年，但她从未失去排练时那种兴奋感，《当今时代》的第一次排练依旧让她激动得不能自已。这是一场新冒险的开始。她并没有感觉自己像一个女主角，而是像个出演自己首个小角色的小丫头那样开心和渴望。但同时，她又美妙地体验到她自己的权利。她再一次有了使用它们的机会。

十一点，她登上舞台。剧组人员无所事事地站着。她亲吻了那些她认识的艺术家，并与他们握手，迈克尔文雅地向她介绍那些她不认识的人。她友好地和艾维斯·克赖顿打招呼。朱莉娅夸她长得非常漂亮，并表达了对她帽子的喜爱；也跟她描述了自己在巴黎为她挑选的那些漂亮裙子。

“你最近见到汤姆了吗？”朱莉娅问道。

“没有。他去度假了。”

“哦，好的。他真是个不错的小家伙，不是吗？”

“很可爱。”

这两个女人注视着对方的眼睛，彼此微笑着。艾维斯朗读台词时，朱莉娅看着她的表情，听着她的语调。朱莉娅冷笑了一下。这正是她所预料的。艾维斯属于那类第一次彩排后就对自己把握十足的女演员。她并不知道自己将遭遇什么。汤姆对朱莉娅来说已经无足轻重了，但她和艾维斯还有一笔账没算清，她可不打算就这么算了。这个荡妇！

这部剧是《谭格瑞的续弦夫人》的现代版，但随着这一代人行为举止的变化，这部剧已改为喜剧。一些原有的老角色被保留下来，奥布里·谭格瑞，现在是个年迈的老人，出现在第二幕中。在波拉死后，他第三次结了婚。科特莱昂太太原想对他和他的第二任妻子所遭遇的不幸进行补偿，可是现在的剧本里她已成为一个乖戾、傲慢的老太太。他的女儿埃琳和休·阿戴尔同意不计前嫌，因为波拉的死似乎将他陷入婚外恋情的记忆抹掉了；他们都已经再婚了。他现在是个退伍的准将，打打高尔夫，或者哀叹哀叹大英帝国——“上帝，老兄，要是我有办法，就让那些可恶的社会学者一个个挨着墙根站好，然后枪毙掉。”而这个时候的埃琳已经是个中年女子，经过了拘谨的青春岁月，变成了一个热情、现代、心直口快的女人了。迈克尔扮演的角色叫罗伯特·汉弗莱斯，同平内罗剧本中的奥布里一样，是个有个独生女的鳏夫；他在中国担任过多年领事，攒了一些钱，退休后定居在一个堂兄留给他的房子里，就在谭格瑞家附近。他的女儿奥娜（这就是艾维斯·克赖顿要演的角色）正在学医，打算去印度行医。在国外待了这么多年，罗伯特没有朋友，一人独居在伦敦，勾搭上一个叫马顿太太的妓女。马顿太太和波拉是一类人，但她不如波拉那样专情；夏天和冬天，她在戛纳接活儿，中间的时间住在阿尔伯马尔街上一套公寓房间里，接待一批英国皇家部队的军官。她打得一手好桥牌，高尔夫球打得更好。这个角色很适合朱莉娅扮演。

作家紧扣原剧台词。奥娜向她父亲宣布，她要放弃自己的医学研究，并在她出嫁前会一直跟他住在一起，她刚刚和埃琳的儿子——一个年轻的卫兵——订婚。心存不安的罗伯特·汉弗莱斯向她透露了想要娶马顿太太的想法。奥娜听完后表现得很冷静。

“你肯定知道她是个妓女，对吧？”她冷漠地说道。

罗伯特倍感尴尬，讲起了马顿太太不幸的一生，他想为她所遭受的一切苦难进行弥补。

“哦，别说这些没用的，”她回答道，“你要是真的能做到，倒是一件大好事。”

埃琳的儿子曾是马顿太太无数情人中的一个，正如埃琳的丈夫曾是波拉·谭格瑞的情人一样。当罗伯特·汉弗莱斯将妻子带回乡下的家中时，这事儿已经被人们发现，他们觉得必须通知奥娜。让他们惊讶的是，奥娜一点都不动声色，她早就知道了。

“我知道这事儿时感到非常开心，”她告诉她的继母，“您瞧，亲爱的，您可以和我聊他在床上的表现。”

这是艾维斯·克赖顿最好的一场戏，整整有十分钟之久，迈克尔从一开始就意识到这场戏的效果和重要性。迈克尔认为，艾维斯那冷漠的、一本正经的漂亮正是这场戏中最生动的存在。但在差不多六次排练后，他开始认为那就是艾维斯的全部演技。他和朱莉娅讨论了此事。

“你觉得艾维斯塑造能力如何？”

“说这个还有些早。”

“我对她不太满意。你说她能演戏。我看不出来。”

“这是个板上钉钉的角色，她肯定演不出错来。”

“你跟我一样明白，根本没有什么板上钉钉的角色。不管一个角色多么好，都得尽力演好才行。我不确定现在将她踢走，换个人来演，是不是更好。”

“这不容易，我觉得你得给她个机会。”

“她太笨拙了，她的手势有时毫无意义。”

朱莉娅思索了一会儿。她自有让艾维斯留在剧组的理由。她很清楚，如果她现在被换掉，她一定会向汤姆抱怨是因为朱莉娅对她的嫉妒。他爱她，会相信她说的一切。他可能甚至会觉得，朱莉娅为了报复他，将这口气撒在了她的身上。不，不，她必须得留下。她必须得出演那个角色，并且以失败告终；汤姆必须亲自看到她是个什么样的演员。他们俩都以为这部剧会让她出名。蠢货。这部剧会扼杀她。

“你知道你有多聪明，迈克尔。我敢肯定你可以训练出她来，如果你愿意费点心。”

“但问题就是这个，她似乎无法领会指导。我明确地告诉她该怎么读一句台词，她总是用自己的方式说了出来。你不会相信，但有时我不禁觉得她有一种错觉，以为自己比我还要厉害。”

“你让她太紧张了。当你让她做什么的时候，她紧张得不知道自己该做什么。”

“天，没有比我更容易相处的人了。我从来没有对她疾言厉色过。”

朱莉娅对他报以柔情蜜意的微笑。

“你打算假装你真的不知道她怎么了吗？”

“不知道，怎么了？”

他看着她，一脸茫然。

“别装了，亲爱的。难道你没有注意到她疯狂地爱着你吗？”

“我？可我以为她实际上已经跟汤姆订了婚。胡扯。你总是会幻想这些事情。”

“但这很明显。毕竟她并不是第一个拜倒在你那致命美貌之下的人，而且我也不认为她会是最后一个。”

“上帝知道，我不想拆可怜的汤姆的台。”

“这不是你的错，对吧？”

“你想让我怎么做？”

“好吧，我觉得你应该对她友善一些。她很年轻，你知道，可怜的小东西。她所想要的就是有人助她一臂之力。如果你给她开几次小灶，跟她一起研习角色，我相信你会创造奇迹。为什么不选一天带她出去吃午饭，跟她聊聊呢？”

她看到迈克尔考虑这提议时眼中闪烁的光芒，以及嘴上隐约挂起的微笑。

“当然，最重要的事情就是尽我们所能演好这部戏。”

“我知道这事儿让你感到厌烦，但坦诚地讲，为了这部剧，我觉得这么做是值得的。”

“你知道我从来不会做让你心烦的事情，朱莉娅。我是说，我更愿意立刻开了这个女孩，找别人来演她的角色。”

“我觉得那么做会是个错误。我相信如果你对她花足了心思，她会有很好的表现。”

他在屋子里来回走了一两次。他似乎在从各个角度考虑这个事情。

“好吧，我想从剧团每个演员身上挖掘出最好的表现就是我的工作。针对不同演员，都必须找到最好的方法。”

他伸出下巴，吸回肚子，挺直后背。朱莉娅明白艾维斯·克赖顿将会保住这个角色，第二天排练时，迈克尔将她带到一边，和她进行了一次长谈。朱莉娅非常清楚他在说些什么，她用眼角的余光注视着他们，不多一会儿就看见艾维斯在点头微笑。他约她跟他一起吃午饭。朱莉娅怀着得意的心情继续琢磨自己的角色。





第二十七章


当罗杰从奥地利回来时，他们已经排练了两周。他在卡林西亚湖待了几周，又在伦敦待了一两天后，和朋友一起去了苏格兰。由于迈克尔早早吃完晚饭去了剧院，朱莉娅自己去见了他。她穿衣服时，伊维像往常一样抽动鼻子，说她花这么多精力打扮就好像要去见一个年轻男人。她希望罗杰以她为荣，她穿着夏天的连衣裙从站台上缓缓走着，毫无疑问她会看起来非常年轻漂亮。你会错误地以为，她对自己所引起的关注毫不知情。享受了一个月的阳光浴的罗杰，皮肤成了深棕色，但脸上依旧有不少粉刺，比起他新年离开伦敦时看起来瘦了一些。她满怀深情地拥抱了他。罗杰微微笑了笑。

他们俩一起吃了晚餐。饭后，朱莉娅问他想不想去看戏或者去看电影，但他说他更愿意待在家里。

“那更好了，”她回答道，“我们就聊聊天吧。”

事实上，迈克尔嘱咐朱莉娅在合适的时候同罗杰谈一谈。既然他很快就要去剑桥读书了，他应该清楚自己将来想做什么。迈克尔有点担心他会在那里虚度时间，最后去了一个经纪人公司或者上舞台表演。他觉得朱莉娅比他机智，且对罗杰更有影响力，他便敦促她把外交部工作的好处以及律师的光辉前途都讲给罗杰听。朱莉娅觉得，如果在两三个小时的谈话中她无法把谈话引到这个重要的话题上，那才奇怪。晚饭的时候，她试图让罗杰讲讲维也纳。但他沉默寡言。

“哦，我就做了那些平常的事情，你知道的。我观光旅游，很努力地学习德语。我去一些喝啤酒的地方看了看，还看了不少歌剧。”

她在想他有没有发生什么风流韵事。

“不管怎样，你回来时没有带着一位维也纳的未婚妻。”她说道，想要把他的话引出来。

他若有所思又觉得有些好笑地看了她一眼。你甚至可能觉得他知道她的意图所在。很奇怪；虽然他是她的儿子，她跟他在一起时并不感到自在。

“不，”他回答道，“我太忙了，顾不上那种事情。”

“我估计你去了所有的剧院。”

“我去了两三次。”

“你看到有什么对我有帮助的吗？”

“你知道，我从来不会想那些。”

他的答案可能听起来有些没礼貌，但他回答时都报以微笑，他的微笑总是很甜。朱莉娅又在想，他怎么会既没有遗传迈克尔的美貌，也没有遗传她的魅力。他那头红发倒是还可以，但那苍白的睫毛让他的脸看起来有些空洞。只有老天知道，有这样的母亲父亲，他是从哪儿获得这么一副粗笨样子的。他现在已经十八岁了；是时候该瘦下一点来了。他看起来有点冷漠；一点都没有她那勃勃的生机；她能想象如果是她在维也纳待了六个月，她会如何生动地描述自己的经历。可不是吗，她已经将自己和嘉莉姨妈还有她母亲在圣马洛的日子编成了故事，让人们哄堂大笑。他们都说她讲的如同戏剧一样，而她自己觉得她讲的比大多数的喜剧都要精彩。她把这故事讲给罗杰听。他脸上挂着迟钝的微笑静静地听着；但她不安地认为，他并不像她那样认为这故事好笑。她在心里叹了口气。可怜的家伙，他不可能有幽默感。然后他的评论让她有机会提起了《当今时代》。她跟他讲了这部戏的故事概要，解释了她的角色；她跟他讲了剧组演员，描述了背景道具。晚餐结束时，她突然意识到她一直在讲她自己还有她所感兴趣的。她不知道自己为什么会这么做，闪念间她觉得是罗杰将对话从他和他的事情上引开，转到了这个方向。但她把这问题先搁在一边。他还没聪明到这份儿上。后来，当他们坐在客厅听广播抽烟的时候，朱莉娅觉得时机到了，便以表面上看起来最随意的方式问出了她准备好的问题。

“你想清楚自己将来要做什么了吗？”

“还没有。着急吗？”

“你知道我在这方面什么都不清楚。但你父亲说如果你想做律师你应该在剑桥学习法律。另一方面，如果你想去外交部工作，你应该学习现代语言。”

他盯着她看了许久，带着他那奇怪的、充满意味的表情，让朱莉娅很难保持她轻松幽默又从容慈爱的表情。

“如果我相信上帝，我应该成为一个牧师。”他最后说道。

“一个牧师？”

朱莉娅不敢相信自己的耳朵。她感到浑身不自在。但他的答案已经在她的脑子里沉淀，一瞬间，她看到他成为一个被一群谄媚的神职人员簇拥着的红衣主教，居住在罗马一座漂亮豪华的布满了美妙画作的宫殿里；然后，他成为一个圣徒，戴着主教冠，穿着缀满金丝的法衣，做着仁慈的手势，布施面包给穷人。她看到自己穿着一件锦缎连衣裙，戴着一串珍珠项链。俨然博尔吉亚家族(1)的母亲。

“十六世纪时，这职业还可以，”她说道，“现在为时太晚了。”

“确实很晚了。”

“我无法明白是什么让你有了这个念头。”他没有回答，以至于她不得不再问一次，“难道你过得不开心吗？”

“很不开心。”他微笑道。

“你想要什么？”

他再次向她投以那种令人不安的注视。很难知道他是否是认真严肃的，因为他的眼睛微微闪烁着喜悦的光芒。

“真相。”

“你说什么呢？”

“你看，我一生都活在弄虚作假的氛围中。我想打开天窗说亮话。你和父亲可以呼吸这种空气，这是你们所知道的唯一的空气，你们觉得这是天堂的空气，但它让我窒息。”

朱莉娅聚精会神地听着，试图明白他的意思。

“我们是演员，成功的演员。这就是为什么我们能够自你出生开始就用奢华包围着你。你能用一只手就数清楚有几个演员将自己的儿子送到了伊顿公学。”

“我很感激你们为我做的一切。”

“那你责备我们什么？”

“我没有责备你们。你们已经做了能为我所做的一切。不幸的是，对我来说，你们也夺走了我对一切事物的信仰。”

“我们从来没有干涉过你的信仰。我知道我们不是宗教人士，我们是演员，在一周八场演出后，我们希望星期天属于我们自己。我很自然地以为学校会负责管理这些事情。”

他再次开口前稍稍犹豫了一下。你会以为他需要做些调整才能继续。

“当我还是个孩子，十四岁的时候，有天晚上我站在舞台的侧翼看你演戏。那肯定是场很精彩的戏，你说话说得那么真诚，那么感人，我禁不住哭起来。我被彻底感动了。我不知道该如何描述，我的情感升华了；我为你感到伤心，我觉得自己是个小英雄；我觉得自己再也不会做卑鄙无耻或见不得人的事情。然后，你来到后台，离我站的地方很近，你脸上全是泪水；你背对着观众，用你平常的声音对舞台经理说：‘那个该死的电工是怎么打灯光的？我告诉他不要打蓝色灯光。’紧接着，你气都没换一下，就转身面向观众，痛苦地哀号，又继续演戏。”

“但，亲爱的，那就是表演。如果一个女演员感受到她所表现的一切情绪，她会把自己撕成碎片。我很清楚地记得这场戏。它曾经博得满堂彩。我人生中还从未听过那么多掌声。”

“我觉得我是个傻瓜，竟然会相信它。我相信了你在台上说的一切。当我发现这些都是假的，我内心有些东西被击毁了。自那之后，我再也不相信你说的了。我曾经上当被愚弄，但我下定决心再也不会这样了。”

她给了他一个令人愉快和放松的微笑。

“亲爱的，我看你是在胡说八道。”

“当然你会这么认为。你并不知道真实和假装之间有什么不同。你从不停止表演。这是你的第二天性。你在这里的宴会上表演。你冲着仆人表演，冲着父亲表演，你面对我时也在表演。对我，你扮演一个喜欢我、宠溺我的著名母亲。你并不存在，你只是你所扮演的数不清的角色之一。我经常会想，你是否真的存在，或者你仅仅是你扮演的那些人的一个媒介。当我看到你独自进入一个空房间时，有时我会想突然打开房门，但我又害怕这样做，因为里面万一一个人都没有呢。”

她快速地瞥了他一眼。她发起抖来，因为他说的话给了她一种可怕的感觉。她全神贯注地听着，有些焦虑，因为他看起来很严肃，并且她感到他正在讲述多年来压在他心上的重担。她从未听他讲过这么多话。

“你觉得我是假的吗？”

“并不是。因为假是你的一切。假是你的真实。就好像对于不知道黄油是什么的人来说，人造黄油就是真黄油。”

她有一种模糊的罪恶感。像《哈姆雷特》中的王后说的那样：“让我来绞你的心肝；我要那么做，假使那不是穿刺不透的石心肝。”她的思绪蔓延开来。

（“不知我扮演哈姆雷特是不是太老了。西登斯和萨拉·伯恩哈特都演过他。我的腿比我见过演这个角色的所有男演员的腿都优美。我要问问查尔斯的想法。当然还有那该死的无韵诗。他不用散文写真是愚蠢。当然啦，我可以在法兰西喜剧院用法语演出。上帝呀，那该多棒啊。”）

她看到自己穿着黑色的紧身上衣和长长的丝绸长筒袜。“哎哟，可怜的约里克(2)。”她继续思考着。

“你总不能说你父亲不存在。这过去二十年，他一直都在扮演他自己。”（“迈克尔可以出演国王，当然他不能说法语，可万一如果我们决定在伦敦一试呢。”）

“可怜的父亲，我想他很擅长他的工作，但他不够聪明，是吧？他一直忙着成为英格兰最英俊的男人。”

“我认为你这么评价你父亲很不好。”

“难道我说了什么你原来不知道的事情吗？”他冷漠地问道。

朱莉娅想微笑，可又不允许打破脸上那稍带痛苦的威严相。

“促使我们彼此相爱的是我们的弱点，而不是我们的强项。”她回答道。

“您是在哪部戏里说的这句台词？”

她强忍住内心的恼怒。那些话很自然地就到了嘴边，但当她诉说这些话时，才意识到是出自一部戏剧。小杂种！但这些话来得很适时。

“你真冷血。”她悲伤地说道。她开始越来越觉得自己像哈姆雷特的母亲。“难道你不爱我吗？”

“如果我能找到真实的你，我可能会。但你在哪儿？如果有人剥夺了你的表现欲，如果有人把你的演技拿走，如果有人像剥洋葱一样一层一层剥掉你的装腔作势和虚伪，还有你演过的角色所给你的标签和虚假情感的碎片，他会最终发现一个灵魂吗？”他神情严肃而悲伤地看着她，微微一笑，“我确实喜欢你。”

“你认为我爱你吗？”

“以你的方式。”

朱莉娅突然感到心慌意乱。

“要是你知道你生病时我有多痛苦就好了！我不知道如果你死了我该怎么办！”

“你会在你唯一孩子的棺材前完美地扮演一个失去孩子的母亲角色。”

“算不上什么好表演，就好像我有机会彩排几次似的。”朱莉娅尖刻地回答道，“你看，你并没有明白，表演并非本性；它是艺术，艺术是你创造出来的。真实的悲痛是很丑陋的；演员的工作就是不仅表现其真实，并且要有美感。如果我真的像我在六七部戏剧中那样快死了，你觉得我还会在乎我的动作是否优雅，我断断续续的话语是否足够清晰地传达给最后一排观众吗？如果这一切都是虚假的，那贝多芬的奏鸣曲一样虚假，我也不会比弹奏它的钢琴家更假。说我不喜欢你太刻毒了。我一心爱你。你一直是我生命中的唯一。”

“不。你喜欢孩子时的我，能跟你一起拍照。那是很不错的照片，有很好的宣传效果。但自从那以后，你就不怎么在乎我了。我只会让你感到厌烦。你总是很高兴见到我，但你很庆幸我能管束自己，并不会占用你的时间。我不责怪你；你生命里没有给任何人留时间，除了你自己。”

朱莉娅开始有点不耐烦了。他所说的太接近事实，让她不安。

“你忘了年轻人总是让人觉得很厌烦。”

“我认为你说得太对了，”他微笑道，“但为什么你无法忍受我不在你的视线中？那也仅仅是表演。”

“你让我很不开心。你让我觉得我好像没有为你尽到义务。”

“但你尽了。你一直都是一个非常棒的母亲。你为我做了一些我会一直都很感激的事情，你没有管我。”

“我不明白你想要什么。”

“我告诉你了。真实。”

“但你去哪儿能找到？”

“我不知道。可能它不存在。我还很年轻；我还无知。我觉得或许在剑桥，见识新的人，阅读新的书，我可能会知道去哪里寻找它。如果他们说，真实只存在于上帝那里，那我就完蛋了。”

朱莉娅的内心被搅乱了。她没有真正理解他说的话，他说的一字一句，重要的并不是它们的意思，而是它们是否被接受，但她敏感地察觉到他内心的感受。当然他只有十八岁，对他过分认真就太愚蠢了，她总是觉得他的这些想法都是从别人那儿得来的，里面一定有好多装腔作势的成分。有人有过自己的想法吗？难道不是都会有点装模作样？当然，或许在那一刻他感受到了他所说的一切，如果她对此表示不屑可不太好。

“当然，我知道你的意思，”她说道，“我在这世界上最大的心愿就是你能够开心。你父亲我来负责，你可以做任何你想做的事情。你必须要寻求你自己的救赎。我明白。但我希望你应该先确定你所有的这些想法并不是病态的。可能你在维也纳太孤独了，我敢说你读书读得太多了。当然，你父亲和我属于不同的一代，我想我们可能无法帮到你。为什么你不跟你的同龄人谈谈你的想法？比如汤姆？”

“汤姆？一个可怜的小势利鬼。他一生仅有的抱负就是成为一个绅士，可是他看不明白，他越努力，就越无望。”

“我以为你非常喜欢他。去年在塔普洛你跟他形影不离。”

“我并没有不喜欢他。我利用了他。他能告诉我许多我想知道的事情。但我觉得他是个无足轻重的小笨蛋。”

朱莉娅想起她曾对他们之间的友谊嫉妒得发狂。想起她浪费在他身上的那些嫉妒之情让她很愤怒。

“你把他甩了，不是吗？”他突然问道。

她大吃一惊。

“我觉得你这么做很明智。他可不够你的等级。”

他用镇静的目光看着他，突然间，令人作呕的恐惧感袭击了她，她害怕他知道汤姆曾做过她的情人。不可能，她告诉自己，那只不过是那有愧的良心在作祟；在塔普洛什么都没发生；也不可能有任何可怕的留言传到他耳朵里；然而，从他的表情中可以看出他对此知情。她感到羞愧。

“我邀请他来塔普洛仅仅是因为我觉得能让你有个同龄的男孩一起玩很不错。”

“确实如此。”

他眼中闪烁着一丝戏谑。她感到绝望。她想问问他在笑什么，但是没有勇气；因为她知道答案；他并没有生她的气，她可以忍受这一点，他只是觉得好笑。她受到深深的伤害。她想大哭，但这只能让他大笑。而且她能对他说什么？他不相信她所说的一切。表演！头一回，她感到不知所措。她在面对她不知道的事物，神秘又令人恐惧的事物。可能是真实的吗？就在那一刻，他们听到一辆汽车开来的声音。

“你父亲回来了。”她喊道。

真让人松了口气！这场面简直无法忍受，她很庆幸，迈克尔的到来必定结束这一切。不一会儿，热情洋溢的迈克尔冲进屋子，伸着下巴，收紧肚子，尽管五十岁了，还是令人难以置信的英俊，他以他那充满男子气概的方式伸出双手迎接他六个月未见的唯一的儿子。

第二十八章


三天后，罗杰去了苏格兰。朱莉娅巧妙地让他俩没有机会再独处。当他们不凑巧需要在一起待几分钟时，两人也会谈一些无关紧要的事情。见到他离开，朱莉娅并没有感到遗憾。她无法从她脑袋里清除她和他的那段奇怪的对话。其中，有一点尤为让她莫名其妙地忧虑；那就是他所暗示的如果她进入一个空房间，然后某个人突然打开了门，发现那房间里根本没有任何人。这让她觉得非常不舒服。

“我从来不是一个绝代佳人，但我身上有一样东西人们从来没有否定过，那就是个性。就因为我可以用一百种不同的方式来扮演一百个不同的角色，便认定我没有自己的个性，这太荒谬了。我能做到这一切是因为我是个相当不错的女演员。”

她试图思考当她独自进入一个空房间时会发生什么。

“但我从来都没有独自一人，即便是在一个空房间里。总会有迈克尔，或者伊维，或者查尔斯，或者观众；当然，这并不是实实在在的，而是精神上的。我必须跟查尔斯说说罗杰。”

不幸的是，查尔斯并不在市里。但他会在彩排的时候回来，首演夜也会来；二十年来他从未错过这些时刻，并且在彩排后他们总是会一起吃晚餐。迈克尔会留在戏院里，忙着处理灯光和其他道具，这样他们就能独处。他们能好好聊一聊。

朱莉娅研究着她的角色。她并不用观察的方式来刻意创造将要表演的角色；她有个本领，能进入她所扮演的角色的世界，用角色的思维进行思考，用角色的感官来体会。她的本能让她捕捉到上百种细微的感触，随后这些细小的感触会让观众因其逼真而感到惊讶不已；但当人们问起她这些感触的来源，她又回答不上来。现在，她要展现这个勇敢但又故作潇洒的马顿太太，这个能打高尔夫又能像正派小伙那样对一个男人讲话，但本质上又是一个令人尊敬、渴望婚姻进入安稳状态的中产阶级妇女。

迈克尔从来不喜欢彩排的时候有一堆人围观，这次，为了将戏剧的神秘性保留到首演，除了查尔斯，他只让摄影记者、裁缝等必须在场的人观看了彩排。朱莉娅的表演也有所保留。她无意在首演前展现自己所能给予这角色的全部。她只需适当表演就够了。在迈克尔井井有条的指导下，一切进展得都非常顺利，到十点的时候，朱莉娅和查尔斯已经坐在萨伏伊饭店的烧烤屋里了。她问他的第一句话便是他认为艾维斯·克赖顿怎么样。

“很不错，非常漂亮。她穿第二场的戏服非常可爱。”

“我不打算穿我第二场的戏服。查理·德夫里尔为我做了另外一件。”

他并没有看到朱莉娅向他投来的略带幽默的眼光，即便他看到了，也猜不出那是什么意思。迈克尔听了朱莉娅的建议后，在艾维斯·克赖顿身上花了不少心思。他在楼上自己的私人房间里对她单独进行指导，告诉她每一个发音和手势的运用。朱莉娅有理由相信，迈克尔不仅与她一同吃了几次午餐，还带她外出共赴晚宴。这一切的结果就是她将这个角色演得不同寻常的精彩。迈克尔搓了搓手。

“我对她很满意。我觉得她会引起轰动。我有点想把她签下来。”

“我不会这么做，”朱莉娅说道，“至少不会在首演夜之前。在呈现给观众之前，你无法确定演出是否会顺利进行。”

“她是个很好的女孩，一个十足的淑女。”

“是个很好的女孩，我想是因为她疯狂地爱着你，又是十足的淑女，因为她一直在抗拒你的勾引，直到她拿到合同。”

“哦，我亲爱的，别犯傻了。我老得都可以做她父亲了。”

但他得意扬扬地微笑着。她非常清楚，迈克尔的示爱不过是牵牵手，在出租车里吻上一两下，但她知道，她对他不忠的怀疑让他很受用。

但现在，朱莉娅在适当照顾自己身材的前提下满足了自己的胃口，开始跟查尔斯说起她心里的事情。

“亲爱的查尔斯，我想跟你谈谈罗杰。”

“哦，好，他前几天回来了，对吧？他怎么样？”

“亲爱的，发生了很糟糕的事情。他变成了一个令人担忧的学究，我不知道该拿他怎么办。”

她向查尔斯复述了他们之间的对话，漏掉了一两件她认为不太方便提及的事情，但她整体上说得比较准确。

“悲剧的是他一点幽默感都没有。”她最后说道。

“毕竟，他只有十八岁。”

“他说那些话的时候，我十分震惊。我觉得自己就像听到他的驴开始跟他讲话的巴兰。”

她开心地看了他一眼，但他甚至都没有笑。他并不觉得她的评论有她认为的那么好笑。

“我无法想象他是从哪里来的这些想法。如果要说这些胡扯都是他自己想出来的，那就太荒唐了。”

“你确定那个年纪的男孩不会比我们大人想象的要思考得多吗？这是一种精神上的青春期，结果往往很奇特。”

“这些年来，罗杰一直怀揣这些想法却守口如瓶，简直虚伪。他可能在指责我。”她大声笑了笑，“跟你讲实话，当罗杰对我说这些的时候，我觉得我像哈姆雷特的母亲。”然后，她紧接着说道：“我在想如果我扮演哈姆雷特，会不会太老了？”

“格特鲁德不是个很好的角色吗？”

朱莉娅感到有趣，放声大笑起来。

“别犯傻，查尔斯。我不会演王后。我会演哈姆雷特。”

“你觉得这角色适合女人来演？”

“西登斯夫人演过，萨拉·伯恩哈特也演过。它将是我职业生涯上的一个里程碑，你懂我的意思吧。当然，有无韵诗的难题。”

“我听有些男演员讲过，跟散文没多大区别。”他回答道。

“是，但并不一样，不是吗？”

“你对罗杰好吗？”

她对查尔斯突然讲回刚才的话题感到惊讶，但她只是笑了笑。

“哦，非常好。”

“要对年轻人的荒诞行为做到有耐心其实很困难；他们跟我们讲二加二等于四，就好像我们从来不知道一样，并且，当他们刚刚发现母鸡能下蛋，而我们又无法分享他们的惊讶时，他们又会大失所望。他们的夸夸其谈和大声咆哮中很多都是胡言乱语，但不完全是。我们应该同情他们；应该尽最大努力去理解他们。我们应该记得，当我们最初面对生活的时候，有多少需要忘记，有多少需要学习。放弃一个人的理想不是一件容易的事情，每日残酷的事实就是要吞下去的苦药。年轻人精神上的矛盾冲突可能会非常严重，而对解决它们又无能为力。”

“但你不会真的觉得罗杰的那番话有什么道理吧？我觉得都是他在维也纳学到的一套胡言乱语。真希望我们没有把他送到那儿去。”

“你可能是对的。可能再过一两年，他就看不到光荣的云彩，并接受生活的锁链。他可能会发现自己寻找的东西，如果不是在上帝身上，就是在艺术里。”

“我可不希望他成为一名演员，如果你是这个意思的话。”

“不，我觉得他并不想成为演员。”

“当然，他也不可能成为剧作家，他一点幽默感都没有。”

“我敢说，他应该很乐意进入外交部。在那儿没有幽默感正好可以成为他的一大长处。”

“你觉得我应该怎么办？”

“什么也别做。随他去吧。这或许是你能给予他的最大的慈爱。”

“但我总是担心他。”

“没有必要。要抱有希望。你以为你生了一只丑小鸭；或许他会变成一只白天鹅。”

查尔斯的回答并不是朱莉娅想要的。她原以为查尔斯会更同情她。

“我想他可能是变老了，可怜的宝贝儿。”她想，“他正在失去对事情的控制。他肯定阳痿好些年了；为什么以前我从来没想过这一点。”

她问了问时间。

“我想我该走了。我必须要好好休息一晚。”

朱莉娅睡得很好，她一醒来就感到浑身兴奋。今晚就是首演。回想到昨晚彩排结束她离开剧院时，人们已经在正厅后座和顶层后座的门外聚集，她感到一阵激动，现在是早上十点，估计那儿已经有一条长长的队伍了。

“幸好今天天气不错，可怜的粗人。”

以往在首演夜前她总是紧张得不得了。她会一整天感到不适，随着时间流逝，甚至有了想要离开舞台的心情。但现在，经过这么多次的磨炼后，她已经能镇定自若地面对了。整个上午，她仅仅感到开心，并有一点兴奋；直到下午，她才开始觉得不适。她变得沉默，想要独处，还有一点易怒；迈克尔早已从多年经验中摸透了她的脾气，此时也刻意不去招惹她。她的手脚开始冰凉，等她到达剧院时，手脚冷得像冰块一样。但是，她的恐惧并没有那么让人不悦。

那天早上，朱莉娅除了中午前到西登斯剧院对台词之外，并没什么可忙的，因此她在床上待到很晚。迈克尔要对布景做最后的调整，没有回来吃午餐，于是她自己吃了饭。然后，她上床美美地睡了一个小时。她想整个下午都休息；菲利普斯小姐六点的时候会给她稍稍按摩一会儿，她想在七点的时候到达剧院。但当她醒来后，她感到自己焕然一新，实在无法继续躺在床上，于是她决定起来出去走一走。那天风和日丽，阳光普照。她喜欢城市胜过乡村，喜欢街道胜过树林，因此她并没有去公园，而是在附近的广场漫步。这个时节的广场人迹罕至，她闲散地看着周围的房子，心想比起这些房子，她多么喜欢自己的那幢。她感到很自在，心情轻松。不久，她觉得是时候回去了。她刚刚走到斯坦霍普广场，就听到一个她一下就能辨认出的声音在喊她的名字。

“朱莉娅。”

她转过身来，汤姆满脸堆笑地迎上来。自她从法国回来还没有见过他。他穿着一身整洁的灰色西服，戴着一顶棕色帽子。他被太阳晒黑了。

“我以为你不在城里。”

“我周一回来的。没有打电话是因为我知道你忙着最后的排练。我今晚会来；迈克尔给了我一张正厅前排的票。”

“哦，我很开心你能来。”

很明显他见到她很开心。他的脸上洋溢着热切之情，眼里泛着光。她很高兴地发现，看到他已经不会在她心里惹起任何涟漪。他们聊天时，朱莉娅在想，他身上到底有什么竟让她以前如此神魂颠倒。

“你究竟为何像这样在这里闲逛？”

“我来散散步。我正打算去喝茶。”

“来跟我一起喝一杯吧。”

他的公寓就在拐角处。事实上，他正是在沿着小巷回家的时候看到她的。

“你怎么回来得这么早？”

“近来办公室没什么忙的。你知道，我们有一个合作伙伴几个月前去世了，这样一来我会拿到更大的份额。这就是说我可以接着住在那套公寓里。迈克尔在这事儿上很慷慨，他说我可以不交房租先住着，直到情况好转一些。我实在不愿被迫搬到别的地方去。请一定要来，我很愿意请你喝茶。”

他兴冲冲地喋喋不休，让朱莉娅觉得好笑。听他说的这些话，你很难想象他们之间曾发生过什么。他看起来一点都不尴尬。

“好吧。但我只能待一小会儿。”

“好的。”

他们走进小巷，她在他前面走上那狭窄的楼梯。

“你进客厅待着，我去烧水。”

她走进去，坐了下来。她向四周看了看，对她来说，这里发生过多少悲欢往事啊。一切都没有改变。她的照片还摆在老地方，但在壁炉架上还摆着艾维斯·克赖顿的一张大照片。照片上写着“致汤姆，艾维斯赠”。朱莉娅把一切都看在眼里。这房间好像她曾经演过戏的一个场景；她感到有些熟悉，但这一切对她而言都不再有意义。彼时让她心力交瘁的爱，她强迫自己压抑的嫉妒，以及委身于对方时的狂喜，这一切并没有比她曾演过的角色多几分真实。她为自己的漠然沾沾自喜。汤姆拿着她送的茶点台布走进来，利索地布置好茶具，那茶具也是她送给他的。她不知道，为何看到他仍旧随意地使用她送他的那些小礼物使她想要大笑。然后，他端着茶走进来，他们并排坐在沙发上喝茶。他对她讲了更多有关他经济条件改善的情况，并以亲切友好的方式承认，多亏通过她，他才能给事务所带来那些业务，让他得以保住更大份额的利润。他跟她讲了他刚刚结束的假期。朱莉娅很清楚，他对他带给她的痛苦一无所知。这也让她想要大笑。

“我听说今晚你会大获成功。”

“能成功就很棒，对不对？”

“艾维斯说你和迈克尔都对她非常好。当心别让她轻而易举地因此剧而成功。”

他说话的语气虽然是在开玩笑，但朱莉娅怀疑是否艾维斯告诉他这是她所期望的。

“你跟她订婚了吗？”

“没有。她想要自由。她说订婚会阻碍她的艺术生涯。”

“阻碍她的什么？”朱莉娅脱口而出，来不及收回，但她立刻恢复镇定，“是的，我当然明白她的意思。”

“我自然不想挡她的路。我是说，假如今晚后她获得了去美国发展的大好机会，我非常理解她应该有充分的自由去接受它。”

她的艺术生涯！朱莉娅暗自笑了。

“你知道，我觉得你真的是个大好人，看到你对她这样好。”

“为什么要这么说？”

“哦，好吧，你知道女人是什么样子！”

他说这些时，伸出胳膊搂住了她的腰，并亲吻了她。她径直笑了出来。

“你真是个混账小东西。”

“亲热一会儿怎么样？”

“别犯傻了。”

“有什么可犯傻的？你不觉得我们分开太久了吗？”

“我主张跟你彻底分开，不再复合。艾维斯怎么办？”

“哦，她是不同的。来吧。”

“你难道忘了我今晚是首演吗？”

“时间足够。”

他用两只手臂搂着她，轻轻地吻她。她双眼充满嘲笑地看着他。突然间她下了决心。

“好吧。”

他们站起来，走进卧室。她摘下帽子，脱下裙子。他像以前那样抱着她。他亲吻她闭着的双眼，还有她引以为傲的小乳房。她让自己的身体配合他，但她的心灵保持冷漠。她出于友好而回敬他的吻，但她发现自己在思考晚上要表演的角色。她似乎变成了两个人，一个是她情人怀中的情妇，另一个是已经在脑海中看到模糊的黑黝黝的一片观众并听到登台时热烈掌声的女演员。过了一会儿，当他们并肩躺在床上，他的手臂搂着她的脖子，她已经彻底忘记了他的存在，因此当他打破长久的沉默时，她被惊了一下。

“难道你已经不在乎我了吗？”

她微微抱了他一下。

“当然在乎，亲爱的。我很宠爱你。”

“今天你很奇怪。”

她意识到他的失望。可怜的小东西，她并不想伤害他的感情。他真的很可爱。

“马上就是首演夜了，我现在不在状态。你一定别介意。”

当她非常明确地得出结论，她已经不再把他放在心上了，不禁对他感到深深的怜悯。她轻轻地抚摸着他的脸颊。

“小甜心。（不知迈克尔有没有给排队的人送茶。这花不了多少钱，但他们却会感激不尽。）你知道，我必须得起来了。菲利普斯小姐六点会过去。伊维要急死了，她不知道我去哪儿了。”

她一边穿衣服，一边开心地聊着天。虽然她没有看他，但她知道汤姆有些不自在。她戴上帽子，然后双手捧起他的脸，给了他一个友好的吻。

“再见，我的宝贝儿。今晚过得愉快。”

“祝你好运。”

他尴尬地笑了笑。她察觉到，他不知道该拿她怎么办。朱莉娅溜出公寓，如果她不是英格兰一等一的女演员，不是一个五十岁的女人，她会从斯坦霍普广场一路蹦跶着回到家里。她扬扬得意，神气十足。她用钥匙开了大门，进去后把门关上了。

“我看罗杰的话确实有些道理。爱情并不值得人们为此大惊小怪。”





第二十九章


四小时后一切都结束了。演出从头到尾都很顺利；尽管现在是一个寻欢作乐的季节，但观众们度假回来很乐意去剧院消遣，并已经准备好了被逗乐的心情。这是这个演出季的好兆头。每一幕结束后都有热烈的掌声，结尾谢幕多达十二次；朱莉娅单独谢幕了两次，连她都被观众的热情反应所震惊。她吞吞吐吐地说了几句为这种场合预先准备好的话。最后是全剧团集体谢幕，交响乐团奏响了国歌。朱莉娅满怀兴奋和喜悦走向自己的化妆间。她从未感到如此自信。她从未像今天这样表演得如此出色、多彩和老练。演出以朱莉娅一段慷慨激昂的长篇演讲结束，身为一个从良的妓女，她批判了婚姻使她陷入的那个轻浮无用、伤风败俗的圈子。那篇演讲足足有两页纸那么长，英格兰没有别的女演员能够像她讲得那样引人入胜。凭借她对时机的巧妙把握，加上她美妙的声音，以及她控制自如的感情，她奇迹般地让这段演讲成为这场表演中令人振奋甚至惊心动魄的高潮。没有任何激烈的动作能更加让人激动，没有任何意想不到的结局能更让人出乎意料。整个剧团的演出都非常棒，除了艾维斯·克赖顿。朱莉娅低声哼着小曲，走向她的化妆间。

迈克尔紧跟着她进入房间。

“演出看起来大获成功。”他用双臂抱住朱莉娅，亲吻了她，“上帝，你的表演太出色了。”

“你自己也不赖，宝贝儿。”

“那是我唯一拿手的角色，”他满不在乎地回答道，依旧对自己的演技保持谦虚，“你讲那段长篇演讲的时候听到观众出声了吗？这会让评论家们大为震惊。”

“哦，你知道他们什么样子。他们会把全部的注意力都放在该死的剧本上，然后在最后三行提一下我。”

“你是世界上最伟大的女演员，亲爱的，但上帝啊，你是个婊子。”

朱莉娅大睁着双眼，表现出极为天真的惊讶。

“迈克尔，你什么意思？”

“别假装无辜。你完全知道我的意思。你认为你能骗得了像我这样的老手吗？”

他双眼闪烁地看着她，朱莉娅艰难地控制住自己才没有大笑出来。

“我像个刚出生的婴儿一样无辜。”

“别装了。如果有人处心积虑地扼杀了一场演出，那你就是扼杀了艾维斯的。我都没法跟你生气，因为你干得太漂亮了。”

现在，连朱莉娅都遮掩不了她上扬嘴角处的微笑了。赞赏总是让艺术家们感激。艾维斯的主要戏份在第二幕，是和朱莉娅的对手戏，迈克尔完全将这场戏排练成艾维斯的戏。这确实是剧本需要，朱莉娅排练时一如既往地完全听从迈克尔的指挥。为了凸显她的金发碧眼，他们让艾维斯穿上浅蓝色戏服。为了形成对照，朱莉娅选择了一件相宜的黄色裙子，这也是她排练时一直穿的裙子。但同时她还订购了另外一件戏服，是光彩夺目的银色，当她穿着这件裙子在第二幕登场时，迈克尔吓了一跳，艾维斯更是惊慌失措。这套衣服耀眼华丽，在灯光下吸引了观众的注意。相较之下，艾维斯的蓝色裙子显得沉闷无比。等两人一起演到关键时刻，朱莉娅就像魔术师从帽子里变出一只兔子一样掏出了一条红色雪纺大手帕，拿在手里玩弄。她挥舞着它，将它铺展开就好像要端详它，她将它拧成一团，用它擦额头，还用它轻轻地擦鼻涕。着迷的观众无法将眼睛从那块红布上挪开。她走到舞台前，让艾维斯对她说话时不得不背朝观众；当她们一起坐在沙发上时，她拉着艾维斯的手，那动作在观众看来充满感情又极为自然，然后深深地坐到沙发里，迫使艾维斯只能侧脸面对观众。朱莉娅在排练的时候就注意到，艾维斯侧脸看起来像只绵羊。作者给艾维斯的台词在起初排练时让剧组觉得十分好笑。在观众还没有意识到这些台词有多有趣前，朱莉娅就立刻切入了自己的回答，由于观众急于听到她说了什么，便抑制住了笑声。这场原本设计为极其有趣的一幕带了一丝冷嘲的色彩，艾维斯扮演的角色让人有些厌恶。由于缺乏经验，艾维斯在没有获得预料中的掌声后惊慌失措；她的声音变得刺耳，手势变得笨拙。

朱莉娅从艾维斯手中接过这场戏，演得极为生动有趣。但她的最后一击却是临时想法。艾维斯要讲一大段独白，朱莉娅紧张地将她的红手帕拧成一个球；这动作本身就表明了一种感情；她双眼困惑地凝视着艾维斯，两行沉甸甸的泪珠顺着脸颊流下。你感到这个女孩对自己的轻佻感到羞愧，你看到她因自己对正义的小小理想、对善良的渴望受到无情的嘲弄而陷入痛苦，但就在那一分钟里，朱莉娅通过那几滴眼泪和痛苦的眼神，揭露了女人悲惨痛苦的一生。艾维斯的演艺生涯就此结束了。

“我真太蠢了，竟然想给她一份合同。”迈克尔说道。

“为什么不呢？”

“在你给了她一刀之后？绝对不行。你真是个淘气的小家伙，嫉妒心竟然这么重。你不会真的以为她对我意味着什么吧？你应该知道，你是我至今唯一的女人。”

迈克尔以为朱莉娅玩这么一出是由于他和艾维斯极为刺眼的调情所致，虽然对艾维斯来讲运气不佳，但迈克尔忍不住觉得有些得意。

“你这头老驴。”朱莉娅微笑着，心里非常清楚他在想什么，对他的错误乐不可支，“毕竟，你是全伦敦最帅的男人。”

“可能确实如此。但我不知道编剧会怎么说。他是个自命不凡的家伙，你可没按照他写的来演那出戏。”

“哦，让我来对付他，我会搞定他。”

此刻有人敲门，进来的正是编剧。朱莉娅高兴地呼喊着走向他，双臂搂住他的脖子，亲吻了他的双颊。

“你开心吗？”

“看起来很成功。”他冷冷地回答道。

“我亲爱的，这戏会演上一年。”她双手搭在他肩膀上，正面瞧着他，“但你是个顽皮的，顽皮的男人。”

“我？”

“你几乎毁掉了我的表演。当我演到第二幕时，突然间我明白那一幕是怎么回事儿了，那时我差点崩溃。你知道那一幕，你是编剧；为什么你不教我们好好排练？就好像那一幕除了表面意思外再没有深层含义了？我们只是演员，你怎么能期待我们——理解你的微妙之处？这是你剧作里最棒的一幕，我差一点搞砸了。这世界上除了你没人能写出这一幕。你的剧本很棒，但那一幕简直棒极了，可谓天才之作。”

编剧红了脸。朱莉娅生气地看着他。他感到既害羞又满足又骄傲。

（“不出二十四小时，这个傻瓜就会真的认为这一幕这样演就是他的本意。”）

迈克尔满脸笑容。

“来我的化妆间坐坐，喝杯威士忌苏打吧。我肯定投入这么多情感后你需要来一杯。”

他们出门时，汤姆正好走进来。他兴奋得满脸通红。

“我的宝贝儿，太了不起了。你简直棒极了。天啊，演出太精彩了。”

“你喜欢？艾维斯很不错，不是吗？”

“不，她糟透了。”

“我亲爱的，你什么意思？我觉得她非常迷人。”

“你彻底把她打败了。即使在第二幕，她都不漂亮。”

艾维斯的艺术生涯！

“我说，你之后去做什么？”

“多莉要为我们举办宴会。”

“你能推辞掉跟我一起去吃晚餐吗？我疯狂地爱着你。”

“哦，胡说八道。我怎么能让多莉失望？”

“哦，跟我走吧。”

他的眼神极其热切。她能看出他从未像现在这样对她有如此热烈的欲望，她为自己的最终胜利而欢欣鼓舞。但她坚定地摇了摇头。走廊里传来一群人说话的声音，他们俩都知道有一队朋友正从狭窄的走廊里走来，你推我搡地要来向她表示祝贺。

“让这些人都见鬼吧。上帝，我太想吻你了。我早上会给你打电话。”

门被猛地打开，肥胖的多莉冒着汗，热情洋溢地头一个冲了进来，大伙把化妆间挤得透不过气来。朱莉娅任凭自己被各色人亲吻着。在这群人中有三四个有名的女演员，她们毫不吝啬对朱莉娅的赞美之词。朱莉娅出色地表演了毫不做作的谦逊。走廊里挤满了人，大家都想一睹她的芳容。多莉费劲地走了出去。

“别太晚，”她对朱莉娅说道，“今晚将有个绝妙的宴会。”

“我会尽早到的。”

最后，朱莉娅摆脱了人群，脱了戏服，开始卸妆。迈克尔走进来，穿着一件晨衣。

“听着，朱莉娅，你得自己去多莉的宴会了。我得去戏票代售处看看，我去不了，我得去盯紧他们。”

“哦，好吧。”

“他们现在正等着我呢。明天一早见。”

迈克尔离开了，留下她和伊维两人。她为多莉的宴会准备的礼服被摆在一把椅子上。朱莉娅涂上了卸妆膏。

“伊维，芬内尔先生明天会打电话过来，你说我出去了，好吗？”

伊维望向镜子，与朱莉娅眼神相对。

“如果他再打过来呢？”

“我不想伤害他，可怜的家伙，但我觉得从现在起我会非常忙碌。”

伊维大声地吸着鼻涕，以她那令人恶心的习惯，用食指抠了抠鼻孔。

“我明白。”她冷冰冰地说道。

“我一向觉得你并不是看起来那么傻。”朱莉娅继续弄着她的脸蛋，“那椅子上的裙子是怎么回事？”

“那件？那是你说参加宴会要穿的裙子。”

“收起来。我不能没有格斯林先生的陪伴独自去赴宴。”

“这是自从什么时候开始的事？”

“闭嘴，你这个丑老太婆。有人打电话来就说我头很疼，得回家休息，但格斯林先生会尽力去赴宴。”

“那是特意为你举办的宴会。你怎么能让你的老朋友这样失望？”

朱莉娅跺了跺脚。

“我不想去赴宴。我就不会去赴宴。”

“家里没有为你准备的食物。”

“我不想回家。我会去饭店吃晚餐。”

“和谁一起？”

“我自己。”

伊维困惑地看了她一眼。

“这部剧大获成功了，不是吗？”

“是的。一切都非常成功。我觉得我登上了世界之巅。我感觉好极了。我想一个人享受这一切。给伯克利饭店打电话，告诉他们在一个小房间里为我准备一个人的桌子。他们会明白我的意思。”

“你到底怎么了？”

“我这辈子再也不会有这样的时刻了。我不会跟任何人分享这一刻。”

朱莉娅将脸洗干净后，没有再进行任何修饰。她既没有涂口红，也没有扑腮红。她又穿上了她来剧院时穿的棕色大衣和裙子，帽子也没换。那是一顶有帽檐的毡帽，她将帽子压下来盖住一只眼，尽可能地挡住自己的脸。准备好后，她看了看镜子中的自己。

“我看起来像一个被丈夫抛弃的裁缝，而且这并非他的错。我相信没人能认出我来。”

伊维从剧院后门处打了电话，她回来后，朱莉娅问，那里有没有许多人在等自己。

“大概有三百人吧。”

“可恶。”她突然有谁都不想见，也不想被任何人看到的欲望。她想要消失一个小时。“告诉消防人员让我从正门出去，我会搭辆出租车走，一旦我离开了，就告诉大伙别等了。”

“只有上帝知道我得忍受什么。”伊维生气地说道。

“你这头老母牛。”

朱莉娅双手捧着伊维的脸，亲吻了她皱巴巴的双颊；然后溜出了她的化妆间，穿过舞台和铁门，走进了漆黑的观众席。

朱莉娅简单的伪装显然颇为奏效，因为当她进入伯克利饭店那间她非常喜欢的小屋子时，那里的领班侍者并没有立刻认出她来。

“你能不能在角落给我安排个位置？”她踌躇地问道。

侍者听到她的声音，又看了一眼，就知道她是谁了。

“您最喜欢的桌子已经为您准备好了，兰伯特小姐。电话里说只有您一人用餐？”朱莉娅点点头，侍者领着她去了角落里的位置。“我听说今晚您的表演大获成功，兰伯特小姐。”好消息传得可真快。“我能点些什么菜？”

领班侍者对朱莉娅独自用晚餐感到十分惊讶，但他的职业允许他向客户们展现的唯一情感就是见到他们时的欣慰。

“我很疲惫，安吉洛。”

“来点鱼子酱作开胃菜吗，夫人，或是牡蛎？”

“牡蛎，安吉洛，要那种很肥的。”

“我会亲自为您挑选的，兰伯特小姐，那主菜呢？”

朱莉娅长长地叹了口气，因为自打她演完第二幕起，她就能够问心无愧地吃一切她想吃的食物。她觉得她应该大吃一顿来庆贺她的胜利，这一次她打算将谨慎全都抛之脑后。

“烤牛排和洋葱，安吉洛，炸薯条，再来一瓶巴斯啤酒。用大银杯装啤酒。”

她可能得有十年没吃过炸薯条了。但这是意义非凡的时刻！今天，她恰好通过一场只能用才华横溢来描述的表演巩固了自己对观众的牢牢把握，巧妙地解决了艾维斯，并让汤姆看到他有多么愚蠢。最关键的是向她自己毫无疑问地证明，她摆脱了那些曾压迫她、让她烦恼的束缚。艾维斯在她脑子里闪现了一下。

“愚蠢的小东西，竟然试图阻挠我的计划。明天我要让她受到人们的嘲笑。”

牡蛎被端了上来，她愉快地享用了它们。她吃了两片涂黄油的黑面包，这可口的滋味使得她觉得可以不惜危及自己不朽的灵魂，然后她大大地喝了一口银杯里的啤酒。

“啤酒，棒极了的啤酒。”她喃喃道。

她能看到迈克尔在知道她的所作所为后拉长的脸。可怜的迈克尔，竟以为她是因为嫉妒他对那个愚蠢的金发小美女太上心才毁了艾维斯的表演。真的，男人们简直愚蠢得让人同情。他们说女人们虚荣，但跟男人比起来，她们简直是谦逊有加的紫罗兰。想到汤姆她止不住想笑。当天下午他想要她，当天晚上他更想得到她。一想到他现在对她来说跟一个舞台工作人员没什么两样，她就觉得浑身自在。不再为感情羁绊让人觉得自信满满。

她所在的饭店房间和大伙吃饭跳舞的大餐厅通过三个拱廊连接；毫无疑问，人群中有不少人去看了今晚的演出。如果他们知道隔壁房间的角落里，那个被毡帽挡住一半脸的女人竟是朱莉娅·兰伯特，他们该感到多么惊讶。坐在那里，没人知道，没人注意，这给了她愉快的独立感。他们在为她表演一出戏，而她成了观众。他们穿过拱廊时，她扫了几眼，年轻的男人和女人，年轻的男人和不那么年轻的女人，秃头的男人和大腹便便的女人，还有涂脂抹粉拼命装成年轻模样的老泼妇。有一些在恋爱，有一些充满嫉妒，还有一些显得漠不关心。

她的牛排上来了。烹饪得正合她意，洋葱清脆，略显焦色。她吃着可口的炸薯条，吸吮着每根指头，就好像这一刻转瞬即逝，她要争取使之延长。

“在牛排和洋葱前面，爱算什么呢？”她问道。独自一人令人陶醉，让她可以尽情神游。她再一次想到汤姆，在心里幽默地耸了耸肩，“真是有趣的经历。”

这段经历必将会对她未来的表演有所帮助。拱廊外的舞者们跟戏里的一幕如此相似，让她想起刚到圣马洛时产生的一个念头。汤姆抛弃她时她所忍受的痛苦，令她回忆起在她还是个小女孩时，她跟随老珍妮·塔特布学习拉辛的《费德尔》。她又读了一遍剧本。提修斯的皇后蒙受的折磨就是她所蒙受的折磨，她不由得感到她们的遭遇惊人的相似。那是她可以演绎的角色；她知道被自己爱慕的年轻男人拒绝是什么感受。天哪，她将给出何等惊艳的表演！她明白为什么今年春天她演得如此糟糕，让迈克尔宁可关掉剧院；因为她在演戏时是在感受那些情感。那可没什么好处。你得拥有那些情感，但你只能在克服它们之后才能进行表演。她想起查尔斯有一次曾对她说诗歌源于平静中所回忆起的那些情感。她对诗歌一无所知，但这话绝对适用于表演。

“可怜的老查尔斯真聪明，能有这样的独到见解。可见贸然评判一个人是多么错误。人们觉得贵族们是一群笨蛋，然后他们之中突然有一个人说出像那样让人惊叹的话。”

但朱莉娅一直觉得，拉辛直到第三幕才让女主角出场是犯了大错。

“如果我演出这部戏，我当然不会照那样胡来。有半幕戏为我的上场烘托就足够了。”

她没有理由不找个剧作家就这个题材为她写一部剧，要么用散文写，要么用简单的诗句，押韵别太频繁。她能念这样的诗句，并且能念得生动形象。这是个不错的主意，毋庸置疑，而且她知道自己该穿什么样的衣服，不是萨拉用来裹着自己的飘垂的布料，而是她和查尔斯在大英博物馆的一尊浮雕上看到的希腊束腰短上衣。

“事情真有趣！你去参观博物馆和画廊，感到十分无聊，但你会在最意想不到的时候发现它们的用处。足以说明艺术并非真的是浪费时间。”

当然，她的双腿很适合穿束腰短上衣，可是穿这个能演悲剧吗？对此她认真地思考了两三分钟。当她为了那冷漠无情的希波吕托斯肝肠寸断时（想到汤姆穿着萨尔维街(1)的高档西服，扮演一个年轻的希腊猎人形象，她不禁咯咯笑起来），她真的能在没有足够的布料的情况下演出悲剧的效果吗？这难题让她激动。然而，她脑海里闪现一个想法，一时间让她心灰意冷。

“这一切都不错，但戏剧家去哪儿找？萨拉有萨尔杜(2)，杜斯有邓南遮(3)，我有谁？‘苏格兰皇后有个好儿子，而我只是个没有子息的光杆儿。’(4)”

然而，她并没有让这一忧伤的想法扰乱她的平静。她兴高采烈，感到自己有能力像丢卡利翁(5)用石头创造人类一样从愚昧的大众中创造剧作家。

“罗杰那天讲的都是一派胡言，可怜的查尔斯似乎把它当真了。他只不过是个自命不凡的小笨蛋，如此而已。”她朝跳舞的房间比了个手势。灯光被调暗了下来，从她坐着的位置看起来这更像一部剧中的一幕。“‘这世界就是个舞台，所有的男人女人都是演员。(6)’但通过那道拱廊，产生了一种假象；我们这些演员们，才是真实。这才是罗杰要寻找的答案。他们就是我们的素材。我们展现他们生活的意义。我们将他们愚蠢的小情感变成艺术，我们创造美，他们的意义在于成为我们实现自己价值所必需的观众。他们是我们演奏的乐器，没有人演奏，乐器有什么用？”

这个想法让她兴奋不已，她心满意足地琢磨了一会儿。她的头脑似乎异常清晰。

“罗杰说我们不存在。哼，只有我们是存在的。他们都只不过是影子，我们给予他们内涵。我们是这一切他们称为生活——混乱无谓的挣扎——的象征，只有这象征才是真实的。他们说表演都是虚假的。这虚假是唯一的真实。”

这样，朱莉娅在自己脑子里重新构架出这柏拉图式的理论，这使她充满了欣喜。突然间，她对那无数匿名观众产生一股亲切之感，他们的存在就是为了给她机会来表现自己。她超然地待在她的山顶上，思考着世人们数不清的活动。她因摆脱了一切世俗的束缚感到无限自由，同这样的狂喜相比，一切都不值一提。她觉得自己像天堂里的精灵。

领班侍者面带奉承的微笑朝她走来。

“一切都还好吗，兰伯特小姐？”

“好极了。你知道，奇妙的是，人与人各不相同。西登斯夫人爱吃排骨；我则一点都不像她，我爱吃牛排。”

PREFACE


It is not very difficult to write a preface to a book that you wrote a long time ago, for the hurrying years have made a different man of you and you can look upon it with a stranger's eyes. You see its faults, and for the reader's delectation you can recall, according to your temperament with toleration or with dismay, the defects in your character as it was then which account for the defects of your book; or you can look back, maybe with the pleasure which distance lends the past, upon the conditions under which you wrote; you can draw a pretty picture of your garret or dwell with modest complacency on the stiff upper lip with which you faced neglect. But when, in order to tempt a reader to buy a book that has no longer the merit of novelty, you set about writing a preface to a work of fiction that you composed no more than two or three years back, it is none too easy to find anything that you want to say, for you have said in your book all you have to say upon the theme with which it deals and having done so have never given it another thought. As nothing is more dead than a love that has burnt itself out, so no subject is less interesting to an author than one upon which he has said his say. Of course you can quarrel with your reviewers, but there is little point in that; what such and such a critic thought of a novel that he read the year before last can only matter to an author of his susceptibility is really too tender for the rough and tumble of this queer world; the critic has long forgotten both the book and his criticism, and the generality of readers never trouble their heads with criticism anyhow.

When first I set up as a professional author I used to paste such reviews as I got in great scrap-books, thinking it would amuse me some day to read them again, and I would carefully head each one with the date and the name of the paper in which it had appeared. But in course of time these unwieldy volumes grew very cumbersome, and because for one reason and another I have seldom lived for long in the same house, I found it necessary at last to get the dustman to rid me of them. Since then I have contented myself with reading my notices, as time wore on with sufficient equanimity not to be unduly perturbed by those that were unfavourable nor unduly elated by those that were laudatory, and throwing them into my waste-paper basket. My recollection is that on the whole the criticisms of Theatre were pretty good. Some critics, however, complained that Julia Lambert, my heroine, was not a creature of high moral character, great intelligence and nobility of soul, and concluded from this that she was a mediocre actress. I have been given to understand that a number of leading ladies were of the same opinion. Indeed one old actress, celebrated for her acting when I was a boy, and still remembered by the middle-aged for the amusingly disagreeable things she so often said, chiefly at the expense of her fellow-players, was quite biting in her references to me; but I think her acrimony was due to a misapprehension. I took pains in my novel to make it clear that my heroine, whatever her other faults, was not a snob, and this naturally enough prevented the old person in question from recognising the fact that my Julia was a fine actress. We are all inclined to think that others can only have our virtues if they also have our vices.

Greatness is rare. During the last fifty years I have seen most of the actresses who have made a name for themselves. I have seen many who had eminent gifts, many who excelled in a domain they had made their own, many who had charm, beauty and knowledge, but I cannot think of more than one to whom I could without hesitation ascribe greatness. This was Eleanora Duse. It may be that Mrs. Siddons had it; it may be that Rachel had it; I do not know; I never saw Sarah Bernhardt till she was past her prime; the glory that surrounded her, the extravagance of her legend, made it difficult to judge her coolly; she was often mannered and she could rant at times like any player queen; at her best she may have had greatness, I only saw its appurtenances, the crown, the sceptre and the ermine cloak—the Emperor of China's new clothes, but no Emperor of China. With the one exception I have mentioned I have only seen actresses who could be good, sometimes very good, in certain parts. I have a notion that one's opinion in this matter depends a good deal on how much one is affected by the glamour of the stage. There are many people whom the theatre fills with an excitement which no familiarity can stale. It is to them a world of mystery and delight; it gives them entry into a realm of the imagination which increases their joy in life, and its illusion colours the ordinariness of their daily round with the golden shimmer of romance. When they watch the celebrated actress, her beauty enhanced by make-up, her significance emphasized by spot-lights, uttering her fine phrases as though they came out of her own head, undergoing remarkable experiences and suffering poignant emotions, they feel that they live more fully; and it is natural enough that they should make a somewhat excessive use of hyperbole when they seek to describe the sensations which the skilful interpreter has given them. It is natural also that they should overlook the fact that the performance which has filled them with rapture owes at least something to the costumier, the scene-painter, the electrician and the author.

Even in my early youth I was never stage-struck; but whether because I am by nature of a somewhat sceptical disposition or whether because my mind was filled with private dreams which satisfied my romantic yearnings, I cannot say; and when I began to have plays acted I lost even the few illusions I had. When I discovered how much effort was put to achieving the gesture that had such a spontaneous look, when I realized how often the perfect intonation which moved an audience to tears was due not to the actress's sensibility but to the producer's experience, when in short I learnt from the inside how complicated was the process by which a play is made ready to set before an audience, I found it impossible to regard even the most brilliant members of the profession with the same awed and admiring wonder as the general public. On the other hand I learnt that they had qualities with which the public is little inclined to credit them. I learnt, for example, that with few exceptions they were hardworking, courageous, patient and conscientious. Though dropping with fatigue after a long day's work, I saw them consent with cheerfulness to go through still once more a difficult scene that they had that very day rehearsed half a dozen times already; I saw them, in illness, give a performance when they could hardly stand on their feet rather than let the company down; and I learnt that for all the frills and airs they might put on, when it came down to the business of getting the best out of the play and themselves, they were as reasonable as anyone could desire. Behind their famous “temperament,” which is a combination of selfishness and nerves more or less consciously emphasized under the erroneous impression that it is a proof of artistic sensibility, there is far oftener than the public imagines an abundance of shrewd, practical sense. I have never known a child that didn't like to show off, and in every actor there remains something of the child; it is to this that he owes many of his most charming gifts. He has more than the normal exhibitionism which is common to all but very few of us, and if he hadn't he would not be an actor; it is wiser to regard this particular trait with humour than with disdain. If I had to put in a phrase the impressions I formed of actors during the long time of my connection with the stage, I should say that their virtues are more solid than they pretend and their failings incidental to the hazardous and exacting profession they follow.

Thirty years elapsed between the production of my first play and the production of my last and in that period I was thrown into intimate contact with a great number of distinguished actresses. Julia Lambert is a portrait of none of them. I have taken a trait here and a trait there and sought to create a living person. Because I was not much affected by the glamour of the brilliant creatures I had known in the flesh I drew the creature of my fancy, I daresay, with a certain coolness. It is this, perhaps, which has disconcerted those readers who cannot separate the actress from the limelight that surrounds her and vexed those actresses who have been so dazzled by the limelight that they honestly think there is no more in them than that. They do themselves an injustice. The quality of the artist depends on the quality of the man and no one can excel in the arts who has not, besides his special gifts, moral rectitude; I would not deny, however, that this may exhibit itself in a form that is surprising and fantastic. I think Julia Lambert is true to life. I should like the reader to notice that though her admirers ascribe greatness to her, and though she accepts the flattery greedily, I, speaking in my own person, have not claimed that she was more than highly successful, very talented, serious and industrious. I should add that for my part I feel a great affection for her; I am not shocked by her naughtiness, nor scandalized by her absurdities; I can only consider her, whatever she does, with fond indulgence.

Before I bring this preface to a close I must tell the reader that in the book which I am now inviting him to peruse I have made two errors in fact. The novelist tries to be accurate in every detail, but sometimes he makes a mistake, and there is generally no lack of persons who are prepared to point it out to him. Once I wrote a novel in which I had occasion to mention a beach called Manly, which is a favourite resort during the bathing season of the inhabitants of Sydney, and unfortunately I spelt it Manley. The superfluous “e” brought me hundreds of angry and derisive letters from New South Wales. You would have thought that the slip, which might after all have been a printer's error, though of course it was due only to my own carelessness, was a deliberate insult that I had offered to the Commonwealth. Indeed one lady told me that it was one more proof of the ignorant superciliousness of the English towards the inhabitants of the English colonies, and that it was people like me who would be responsible if next time Great Britain was embroiled in a Continental war the youth of Australia, instead of flying to her rescue, preferred to stay quietly at home. She ended her letter on a rhetorical note. What, she asked me, would the English say if an Australian novelist, writing about England, should spell Bournmouth with an “e”? My first impulse was to answer that to the best of my belief the English wouldn't turn a hair, even if it were incorrect, which in point of fact it wasn't, but I thought it would better become me to suffer the lady's stern rebuke in silence. Now in this book I have made two mistakes; I have made my heroine put down her failure in Beatrice to the fact that she was not at ease with blank verse, and I have made her, when she speaks of Racine's Phèdre, complain that the heroine did not appear till the third act. Instead of verifying my facts as I should have done, I trusted my memory, and my memory played me false. Beatrice speaks very little verse; all her important scenes are in prose; and if Julia failed in the part it was not for the reason she gave. Phèdre enters upon the stage in the third scene of the first act. I do not know why only two persons, one apiece, pointed out to me these inexcusable blunders; I like to think that most readers did me the credit of supposing that they were due, not to my ignorance, but tomy subtlety, and that in making Julia Lambert speak in this casual and haphazard fashion I was adding a neat touch to my delineation of her character. But I may be unduly flattering myself, and it is just possible that my readers' recollection of the famous plays in which these characters appear was as hazy as my own, and they knew no better.





Chapter 1


The door opened and Michael Gosselyn looked up. Julia came in.

“Hulloa! I won't keep you a minute. I was just signing some letters.”

“No hurry. I only came to see what seats had been sent to the Dennorants. What's that young man doing here?”

With the experienced actress's instinct to fit the gesture to the word, by a movement of her neat head she indicated the room through which she had just passed.

“He's the accountant. He comes from Lawrence and Hamphreys. He's been here three days.”

“He looks very young.”

“He's an articled clerk. He seems to know his job. He can't get over the way our accounts are kept. He told me he never expected a theatre to be run on such businesslike lines. He says the way some of those firms in the city keep their accounts is enough to turn your hair grey.”

Julia smiled at the complacency on her husband's handsome face.

“He's a young man of tact.”

“He finishes today. I thought we might take him back with us and give him a spot of lunch. He's quite a gentleman.”

“Is that a sufficient reason to ask him to lunch?”

Michael did not notice the faint irony of her tone.

“I won't ask him if you don't want him. I merely thought it would be such a treat for him. He admires you tremendously. He's been to see the play three times. He's crazy to be introduced to you.”

Michael touched a button and in a moment his secretary came in.

“Here are the letters, Margery. What appointments have I got for this afternoon?”

Julia with half an ear listened to the list Margery read out and, though she knew the room so well, idly looked about her. It was a very proper room for the manager of a first-class theatre. The walls had been panelled (at cost price) by a good decorator and on them hung engravings of theatrical pictures of Zoffany and de Wilde. The armchairs were large and comfortable. Michael sat in a heavily-carved Chippendale chair, a reproduction but made by a well-known firm, and his Chippendale table, with heavy ball-and-claw feet, was immensely solid. On it stood in a massive silver frame a photograph of herself and to balance it a photograph of Roger, their son. Between these was a magnificent silver inkstand that she had herself given him on one of his birthdays and behind it a rack in red morocco, heavily gilt, in which he kept his private paper in case he wanted to write a letter in his own hand. The paper bore the address, Siddons Theatre, and the envelope his crest, a boar's head with the motto underneath: Nemo me impune lacessit. A bunch of yellow tulips in a silver bowl, which he had got through winning the theatrical golf tournament three times running, showed Margery's care. Julia gave her a reflective glance. Notwithstanding her cropped peroxide hair and her heavily-painted lips she had the neutral look that marks the perfect secretary. She had been with Michael for five years. In that time she must have got to know him inside and out. Julia wondered if she could be such a fool as to be in love with him.

But Michael rose from his chair.

“Now, darling, I'm ready for you.”

Margery gave him his black Homburg hat and opened the door for Julia and Michael to go out. As they entered the office the young man Julia had noticed turned round and stood up.

“I should like to introduce you to Miss Lambert,” said Michael. Then with the air of an ambassador presenting an attaché to the sovereign of the court to which he is accredited: “This is the gentleman who is good enough to put some order into the mess we make of our accounts.”

The young man went scarlet. He smiled stiffly in answer to Julia's warm, ready smile and she felt the palm of his hand wet with sweat when she cordially grasped it. His confusion was touching. That was how people had felt when they were presented to Sarah Siddons. She thought that she had not been very gracious to Michael when he had proposed asking the boy to lunch. She looked straight into his eyes. Her own were large, of a very dark brown, and starry. It was no effort to her, it was as instinctive as brushing away a fly that was buzzing round her, to suggest now a faintly amused, friendly tenderness.

“I wonder if we could persuade you to come and eat a chop with us. Michael will drive you back after lunch.”

The young man blushed again and his Adam's apple moved in his thin neck.

“It's awfully kind of you.” He gave his clothes a troubled look. “I'm absolutely filthy.”

“You can have a wash and brush up when we get home.”

The car was waiting for them at the stage door, a long car in black and chromium, upholstered in silver leather, and with Michael's crest discreetly emblazoned on the doors. Julia got in.

“Come and sit with me. Michael is going to drive.”

They lived in Stanhope Place, and when they arrived Julia told the butler to show the young man where he could wash his hands. She went up to the drawing-room. She was painting her lips when Michael joined her.

“I've told him to come up as soon as he's ready.”

“By the way, what's his name?”

“I haven't a notion.”

“Darling, we must know. I'll ask him to write in our book.”

“Damn it, he's not important enough for that.” Michael asked only very distinguished people to write in their book. “We shall never see him again.”

At that moment the young man appeared. In the car Julia had done all she could to put him at his ease, but he was still very shy. The cocktails were waiting and Michael poured them out. Julia took a cigarette and the young man struck a match for her, but his hand was trembling so much that she thought he would never be able to hold the light near enough to her cigarette, so she took his hand and held it.

“Poor lamb,” she thought, “I suppose this is the most wonderful moment in his whole life. What fun it'll be for him when he tells his people. I expect he'll be a blasted little hero in his office.”

Julia talked very differently to herself and to other people: when she talked to herself her language was racy. She inhaled the first whiff of her cigarette with delight. It was really rather wonderful, when you came to think of it, that just to have lunch with her and talk to her for three quarters of an hour, perhaps, could make a man quite important in his own scrubby little circle.

The young man forced himself to make a remark.

“What a stunning room this is.”

She gave him the quick, delightful smile, with a slight lift of her fine eyebrows, which he must often have seen her give on the stage.

“I'm so glad you like it.” Her voice was rather low and ever so slightly hoarse. You would have thought his observation had taken a weight off her mind. “We think in the family that Michael has such perfect taste.”

Michael gave the room a complacent glance.

“I've had a good deal of experience. I always design the sets myself for our plays. Of course, I have a man to do the rough work for me, but the ideas are mine.”

They had moved into that house two years before, and he knew, and Julia knew, that they had put it into the hands of an expensive decorator when they were going on tour, and he had agreed to have it completely ready for them, at cost price in return for the work they promised him in the theatre, by the time they came back. But it was unnecessary to impart such tedious details to a young man whose name even they did not know. The house was furnished in extremely good taste, with a judicious mixture of the antique and the modern, and Michael was right when he said that it was quite obviously a gentleman's house. Julia, however, had insisted that she must have her bedroom as she liked, and having had exactly the bedroom that pleased her in the old house in Regent's Park which they had occupied since the end of the war she brought it over bodily. The bed and the dressing-table were upholstered in pink silk, the chaise-longue and the armchair in Nattier blue; over the bed there were fat little gilt cherubs who dangled a lamp with a pink shade, and fat little gilt cherubs swarmed all round the mirror on the dressing-table. On satinwood tables were signed photographs, richly framed, of actors and actresses and members of the royal family. The decorator had raised his supercilious eyebrows, but it was the only room in the house in which Julia felt completely at home. She wrote her letters at a satinwood desk, seated on a gilt Hamlet stool.

Lunch was announced and they went downstairs.

“I hope you'll have enough to eat,” said Julia. “Michael and I have very small appetites.”

In point of fact there was grilled sole, grilled cutlets and spinach, and stewed fruit. It was a meal designed to satisfy legitimate hunger, but not to produce fat. The cook, warned by Margery that there was a guest to lunch, had hurriedly made some fried potatoes. They looked crisp and smelt appetizing. Only the young man took them. Julia gave them a wistful look before she shook her head in refusal. Michael stared at them gravely for a moment as though he could not quite tell what they were, and then with a little start, breaking out of a brown study, said No thank you. They sat at a refectory table, Julia and Michael at either end in very grand Italian chairs, and the young man in the middle on a chair that was not at all comfortable, but perfectly in character. Julia noticed that he seemed to be looking at the sideboard and, with her engaging smile, leaned forward.

“What is it?”

He blushed scarlet.

“I was wondering if I might have a piece of bread.”

“Of course.”

She gave the butler a significant glance; he was at that moment helping Michael to a glass of dry white wine, and he left the room.

“Michael and I never eat bread. It was stupid of Jevons not to realize that you might want some.”

“Of course bread is only a habit,” said Michael. “It's wonderful how soon you can break yourself of it if you set your mind to it.”

“The poor lamb's as thin as a rail, Michael.”

“I don't not eat bread because I'm afraid of getting fat. I don't eat it because I see no point in it. After all, with the exercise I take I can eat anything I like.”

He still had at fifty-two a very good figure. As a young man, with a great mass of curling chestnut hair, with a wonderful skin and large deep-blue eyes, a straight nose and small ears, he had been the best-looking actor on the English stage. The only thing that slightly spoiled him was the thinness of his mouth. He was just six foot tall and he had a gallant bearing. It was his obvious beauty that had engaged him to go on the stage rather than to become a soldier like his father. Now his chestnut hair was very grey, and he wore it much shorter; his face had broadened and was a good deal lined; his skin no longer had the soft bloom of a peach and his colour was high. But with his splendid eyes and his fine figure he was still a very handsome man. Since his five years at the war he had adopted a military bearing, so that if you had not known who he was (which was scarcely possible, for in one way and another his photograph was always appearing in the illustrated papers) you might have taken him for an officer of high rank. He boasted that his weight had not changed since he was twenty, and for years, wet or fine, he had got up every morning at eight to put on shorts and a sweater and have a run round Regent's Park.

“The secretary told me you were rehearsing this morning, Miss Lambert,” the young man remarked. “Does that mean you're putting on a new play?”

“Not a bit of it,” answered Michael. “We're playing to capacity.”

“Michael thought we were getting a bit ragged, so he called a rehearsal.”

“I'm very glad I did. I found little bits of business had crept in that I hadn't given them and a good many liberties were being taken with the text. I'm a great stickler for saying the author's exact words, though, God knows, the words authors write nowadays aren't much.”

“If you'd like to come and see our play,” Julia said graciously, “I'm sure Michael will be delighted to give you some seats.”

“I'd love to come again,” the young man answered eagerly. “I've seen it three times already.”

“You haven't?” cried Julia, with surprise, though she remembered perfectly that Michael had already told her so. “Of course it's not a bad little play, it's served our purpose very well, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to see it three times.”

“It's not so much the play I went to see, it was your performance.”

“I dragged that out of him all right,” thought Julia, and then aloud: “When we read the play Michael was rather doubtful about it. He didn't think my part was very good. You know, it's not really a star part. But I thought I could make something out of it. Of course we had to cut the other woman a lot in rehearsals.”

“I don't say we rewrote the play,” said Michael, “but I can tell you it was a very different play we produced from the one the author submitted to us.”

“You're simply wonderful in it,” the young man said.

(“He has a certain charm.”) “I'm glad you liked me,” she answered.

“If you're very nice to Julia I daresay she'll give you a photograph of herself when you go.”

“Would you?”

He blushed again and his blue eyes shone. (“He's really rather sweet.”) He was not particularly good-looking, but he had a frank, open face and his shyness was attractive. He had curly light-brown hair, but it was plastered down and Julia thought how much better he would look if, instead of trying to smooth out the wave with brilliantine, he made the most of it. He had a fresh colour, a good skin and small well-shaped teeth. She noticed with approval that his clothes fitted and that he wore them well. He looked nice and clean.

“I suppose you've never had anything to do with the theatre from the inside before?” she said.

“Never. That's why I was so crazy to get this job. You can't think how it thrills me.”

Michael and Julia smiled on him kindly. His admiration made them feel a little larger than life-size.

“I never allow outsiders to come to rehearsals, but as you're our accountant you almost belong to the theatre, and I wouldn't mind making an exception in your favour if it would amuse you to come.”

“That would be terribly kind of you. I've never been to a rehearsal in my life. Are you going to act in the next play?”

“Oh, I don't think so. I'm not very keen about acting any more. I find it almost impossible to find a part to suit me. You see, at my time of life I can't very well play young lovers, and authors don't seem to write the parts they used to write when I was a young fellow. What the French call a raisonneur. You know the sort of thing I mean, a duke, or a cabinet minister, or an eminent K.C. who says clever, witty things and turns people round his little finger. I don't know what's happened to authors. They don't seem able to write good lines any more. Bricks without straw; that's what we actors are expected to make nowadays. And are they grateful to us? The authors, I mean. You'd be surprised if I told you the terms some of them have the nerve to ask.”

“The fact remains, we can't do without them,” smiled Julia. “If the play's wrong no acting in the world will save it.”

“That's because the public isn't really interested in the theatre. In the great days of the English stage people didn't go to see the plays, they went to see the players. It didn't matter what Kemble and Mrs. Siddons acted. The public went to see them. And even now, though I don't deny that if the play's wrong you're dished, I do contend that if the play's right, it's the actors the public go to see, not the play.”

“I don't think anyone can deny that,” said Julia.

“All an actress like Julia wants is a vehicle. Give her that and she'll do the rest.”

Julia gave the young man a delightful but slightly deprecating smile.

“You mustn't take my husband too seriously. I'm afraid we must admit that he's partial where I'm concerned.”

“Unless this young man is a much bigger fool than I think him he must know that there's nothing in the way of acting that you can't do.”

“Oh, that's only an idea that people have got because I take care never to do anything but what I can do.”

Presently Michael looked at his watch.

“I think when you've finished your coffee, young man, we ought to be going.”

The boy gulped down what was left in his cup and Julia rose from the table.

“You won't forget my photograph?”

“I think there are some in Michael's den. Come along and we'll choose one.”

She took him into a fair-sized room behind the dining-room. Though it was supposed to be Michael's private sitting-room—“a fellow wants a room where he can get away by himself and smoke his pipe”—it was chiefly used as a cloak-room when they had guests. There was a noble mahogany desk on which were signed photographs of George V and Queen Mary. Over the chimney-piece was an old copy of Lawrence's portrait of Kemble as Hamlet. On a small table was a pile of typescript plays. The room was surrounded by bookshelves under which were cupboards, and from one of these Julia took a bundle of her latest photographs. She handed one to the young man.

“This one is not so bad.”

“It's lovely.”

“Then it can't be as like me as I thought.”

“But it is. It's exactly like you.”

She gave him another sort of smile, just a trifle roguish; she lowered her eyelids for a second and then raising them gazed at him for a little with that soft expression that people described as her velvet look. She had no object in doing this. She did it, if not mechanically, from an instinctive desire to please. The boy was so young, so shy, he looked as if he had such a nice nature, and she would never see him again, she wanted him to have his money's worth; she wanted him to look back on this as one of the great moments of his life. She glanced at the photograph again. She liked to think she looked like that. The photographer had so posed her, with her help, as to show her at her best. Her nose was slightly thick, but he had managed by his lighting to make it look very delicate, not a wrinkle marred the smoothness of her skin, and there was a melting look in her fine eyes.

“All right. You shall have this one. You know I'm not a beautiful woman, I'm not even a very pretty one; Coquelin always used to say I had the beauté du diable. You understand French, don't you?”

“Enough for that.”

“I'll sign it for you.”

She sat at the desk and with her bold, flowing hand wrote: Yours sincerely, Julia Lambert.





Chapter 2


When the two men had gone she looked through the photographs again before putting them back.

“Not bad for a woman of forty-six,” she smiled. “They are like me, there's no denying that.” She looked round the room for a mirror, but there wasn't one. “These damned decorators. Poor Michael, no wonder he never uses this room. Of course I never have photographed well.”

She had an impulse to look at some of her old photographs. Michael was a tidy, businesslike man, and her photographs were kept in large cardboard cases, dated and chronologically arranged. His were in other cardboard cases in the same cupboard.

“When someone comes along and wants to write the story of our careers he'll find all the material ready to his hand,” he said.

With the same laudable object he had had all their press cuttings from the very beginning pasted in a series of books.

There were photographs of Julia when she was a child, and photographs of her as a young girl, photographs of her in her first parts, photographs of her as a young married woman, with Michael, and then with Roger, her son, as a baby. There was one photograph of the three of them, Michael very manly and incredibly handsome, herself all tenderness looking down at Roger with maternal feeling, and Roger a little boy with a curly head, which had been an enormous success. All the illustrated papers had given it a full page and they had used it on the programmes. Reduced to picture-postcard size it had sold in the provinces for years. It was such a bore that Roger when he got to Eton refused to be photographed with her any more. It seemed so funny of him not to want to be in the papers.

“People will think you're deformed or something,” she told him. “And it's not as if it weren't good form. You should just go to a first night and see the society people how they mob the photographers, cabinet ministers and judges and everyone. They may pretend they don't like it, but just see them posing when they think the cameraman's got his eye on them.”

But he was obstinate.

Julia came across a photograph of herself as Beatrice. It was the only Shakespearean part she had ever played. She knew that she didn't look well in costume; she could never understand why, because no one could wear modern clothes as well as she could. She had her clothes made in Paris, both for the stage and for private life, and the dressmakers said that no one brought them more orders. She had a lovely figure, everyone admitted that; she was fairly tall for a woman, and she had long legs. It was a pity she had never had a chance of playing Rosalind, she would have looked all right in boy's clothes, of course it was too late now, but perhaps it was just as well she hadn't risked it. Though you would have thought, with her brilliance, her roguishness, her sense of comedy she would have been perfect. The critics hadn't really liked her Beatrice. It was that damned blank verse. Her voice, her rather low rich voice, with that effective hoarseness, which wrung your heart in an emotional passage or gave so much humour to a comedy line, seemed to sound all wrong when she spoke it. And then her articulation; it was so distinct that, without raising her voice, she could make you hear her every word in the last row of the gallery; they said it made verse sound like prose. The fact was, she supposed, that she was much too modern.

Michael had started with Shakespeare. That was before she knew him. He had played Romeo at Cambridge, and when he came down, after a year at a dramatic school, Benson had engaged him. He toured the country and played a great variety of parts. But he realized that Shakespeare would get him nowhere and that if he wanted to become a leading actor he must gain experience in modern plays. A man called James Langton was running a repertory theatre at Middlepool that was attracting a good deal of attention; and after Michael had been with Benson for three years, when the company was going to Middlepool on its annual visit, he wrote to Langton and asked whether he would see him. Jimmie Langton, a fat, bald-headed, rubicund man of forty-five, who looked like one of Rubens' prosperous burghers, had a passion for the theatre. He was an eccentric, arrogant, exuberant, vain and charming fellow. He loved acting, but his physique prevented him from playing any but a few parts, which was fortunate, for he was a bad actor. He could not subdue his natural flamboyance, and every part he played, though he studied it with care and gave it thought, he turned into a grotesque. He broadened every gesture, he exaggerated every intonation. But it was a very different matter when he rehearsed his cast; then he would suffer nothing artificial. His ear was perfect, and though he could not produce the right intonation himself he would never let a false one pass in anyone else.

“Don't be natural,” he told his company. “The stage isn't the place for that. The stage is make-believe. But seem natural.”

He worked his company hard. They rehearsed every morning from ten till two, when he sent them home to learn their parts and rest before the evening's performance. He bullied them, he screamed at them, he mocked them. He underpaid them. But if they played a moving scene well he cried like a child, and when they said an amusing line as he wanted it said he bellowed with laughter. He would skip about the stage on one leg if he was pleased, and if he was angry would throw the script down and stamp on it while tears of rage ran down his cheeks. The company laughed at him and abused him and did everything they could to please him. He aroused a protective instinct in them, so that one and all they felt that they couldn't let him down. Though they said he drove them like slaves, and they never had a moment to themselves, flesh and blood couldn't stand it, it gave them a sort of horrible satisfaction to comply with his outrageous demands. When he wrung an old trouper's hand, who was getting seven pounds a week, and said, by God, laddie, you're stupendous, the old trouper felt like Charles Kean.

It happened that when Michael kept the appointment he had asked for, Jimmie Langton was in need of a leading juvenile. He had guessed why Michael wanted to see him, and had gone the night before to see him play. Michael was playing Mercutio and he had not thought him very good, but when he came into the office he was staggered by his beauty. In a brown coat and grey flannel trousers, even without make-up, he was so handsome it took your breath away. He had an easy manner and he talked like a gentleman. While Michael explained the purpose of his visit Jimmie Langton observed him shrewdly. If he could act at all, with those looks that young man ought to go far.

“I saw your Mercutio last night,” he said. “What d'you think of it yourself?”

“Rotten.”

“So do I. How old are you?”

“Twenty-five.”

“I suppose you've been told you're good-looking?”

“That's why I went on the stage. Otherwise I'd have gone into the army like my father.”

“By gum, if I had your looks what an actor I'd have been.”

The result of the interview was that Michael got an engagement. He stayed at Middlepool for two years. He soon grew popular with the company. He was good-humoured and kindly; he would take any amount of trouble to do anyone a service. His beauty created a sensation in Middlepool and the girls used to hang about the stage door to see him go out. They wrote him love letters and sent him flowers. He took it as a natural homage, but did not allow it to turn his head. He was eager to get on and seemed determined not to let any entanglement interfere with his career. It was his beauty that saved him, for Jimmie Langton quickly came to the conclusion that, notwithstanding his perseverance and desire to excel, he would never be more than a competent actor. His voice was a trifle thin and in moments of vehemence was apt to go shrill. It gave then more the effect of hysteria than of passion. But his gravest fault as a juvenile lead was that he could not make love. He was easy enough in ordinary dialogue and could say his lines with point, but when it came to making protestations of passion something seemed to hold him back. He felt embarrassed and looked it.

“Damn you, don't hold that girl as if she was a sack of potatoes,” Jimmie Langton shouted at him. “You kiss her as if you were afraid you were standing in a draught. You're in love with that girl. You must feel that you're in love with her. Feel as if your bones were melting inside you and if an earthquake were going to swallow you up next minute, to hell with the earthquake.”

But it was no good. Notwithstanding his beauty, his grace and his ease of manner, Michael remained a cold lover. This did not prevent Julia from falling madly in love with him. For it was when he joined Langton's repertory company that they met.

Her own career had been singularly lacking in hardship. She was born in Jersey, where her father, a native of that island, practised as a veterinary surgeon. Her mother's sister was married to a Frenchman, a coal merchant, who lived at St. Malo, and Julia had been sent to live with her while she attended classes at the local lycée. She learnt to speak French like a Frenchwoman. She was a born actress and it was an understood thing for as long as she could remember that she was to go on the stage. Her aunt, Madame Falloux, was “en relations” with an old actress who had been a sociétaire of the Comédie Française and who had retired to St. Malo to live on the small pension that one of her lovers had settled on her when after many years of faithful concubinage they had parted. When Julia was a child of twelve this actress was a boisterous, fat old woman of more than sixty, but of great vitality, who loved food more than anything else in the world. She had a great, ringing laugh, like a man's, and she talked in a deep, loud voice. It was she who gave Julia her first lessons. She taught her all the arts that she had herself learnt at the Conservatoire and she talked to her of Reichenberg who had played ingénues till she was seventy, of Sarah Bernhardt and her golden voice, of Mounet-Sully and his majesty, and of Coquelin the greatest actor of them all. She recited to her the great tirades of Corneille and Racine she had learnt to say them at the Français and taught her to say them in the same way. It was charming to hear Julia in her childish voice recite those languorous, passionate speeches of Phèdre, emphasizing the beat of the Alexandrines and mouthing her words in the manner which is so artificial and yet so wonderfully dramatic. Jane Taitbout must always have been a very stagy actress, but she taught Julia to articulate with extreme distinctness, she taught her how to walk and how to hold herself, she taught her not to be afraid of her own voice, and she made deliberate that wonderful sense of timing which Julia had by instinct and which afterwards was one of her greatest gifts.

“Never pause unless you have a reason for it,” she thundered, banging with her clenched fist on the table at which she sat, “but when you pause, pause as long as you can.”

When Julia was sixteen and went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in Gower Street she knew already much that they could teach her there. She had to get rid of a certain number of tricks that were out of date and she had to acquire a more conversational style. But she won every prize that was open to her, and when she was finished with the school her good French got her almost immediately a small part in London as a French maid. It looked for a while as though her knowledge of French would specialize her in parts needing a foreign accent, for after this she was engaged to play an Austrian waitress. It was two years later that Jimmie Langton discovered her. She was on tour in a melodrama that had been successful in London; in the part of an Italian adventuress, whose machinations were eventually exposed, she was trying somewhat inadequately to represent a woman of forty. Since the heroine, a blonde person of mature years, was playing a young girl, the performance lacked verisimilitude. Jimmie was taking a short holiday which he spent in going every night to the theatre in one town after another. At the end of the piece he went round to see Julia. He was well enough known in the theatrical world for her to be flattered by the compliments he paid her, and when he asked her to lunch with him next day she accepted.

They had no sooner sat down to table than he went straight to the point.

“I never slept a wink all night for thinking of you,” he said.

“This is very sudden. Is your proposal honourable or dis-honourable?”

He took no notice of the flippant rejoinder.

“I've been at this game for twenty-five years. I've been a callboy, a stage-hand, a stage-manager, an actor, a publicity man, damn it, I've even been a critic. I've lived in the theatre since I was a kid just out of a board school, and what I don't know about acting isn't worth knowing. I think you're a genius.”

“It's sweet of you to say so.”

“Shut up. Leave me to do the talking. You've got everything. You're the right height, you've got a good figure, you've got an indiarubber face.”

“Flattering, aren't you?”

“That's just what I am. That's the face an actress wants. The face that can look anything, even beautiful, the face that can show every thought that passes through the mind. That's the face Duse's got. Last night even though you weren't really thinking about what you were doing, every now and then the words you were saying wrote themselves on your face.”

“It's such a rotten part. How could I give it my attention? Did you hear the things I had to say?”

“Actors are rotten, not parts. You've got a wonderful voice, the voice that can wring an audience's heart, I don't know about your comedy, I'm prepared to risk that.”

“What d'you mean by that?”

“Your timing is almost perfect. That couldn't have been taught, you must have that by nature. That's the far, far better way. Now let's come down to brass tacks. I've been making enquiries about you. It appears you speak French like a Frenchwoman and so they give you broken English parts. That's not going to lead you anywhere, you know.”

“That's all I can get.”

“Are you satisfied to go on playing those sort of parts for ever? You'll get stuck in them and the public won't take you in anything else. Seconds, that's all you'll play. Twenty pounds a week at the outside and a great talent wasted.”

“I've always thought that someday or other I should get a chance of a straight part.”

“When? You may have to wait ten years. How old are you now?”

“Twenty.”

“What are you getting?”

“Fifteen pounds a week.”

“That's a lie. You're getting twelve, and it's a damned sight more than you're worth. You've got everything to learn. Your gestures are commonplace. You don't know that every gesture must mean something. You don't know how to get an audience to look at you before you speak. You make up too much. With your sort of face the less make-up the better. Wouldn't you like to be a star?”

“Who wouldn't?”

“Come to me and I'll make you the greatest actress in England. Are you a quick study? You ought to be at your age.”

“I think I can be word-perfect in any part in forty-eight hours.”

“It's experience you want and me to produce you. Come to me and I'll let you play twenty parts a year. Ibsen, Shaw, Barker, Sudermann, Hankin, Galsworthy. You've got magnetism and you don't seem to have an idea how to use it.” He chuckled. “By God, if you had, that old hag would have had you out of the play you're in now before you could say knife. You've got to take an audience by the throat and say, now, you dogs, you pay attention to me. You've got to dominate them. If you haven't got the gift no one can give it to you, but if you have you can be taught how to use it. I tell you, you've got the makings of a great actress. I've never been so sure of anything in my life.”

“I know I want experience. I'd have to think it over of course. I wouldn't mind coming to you for a season.”

“Go to hell. Do you think I can make an actress of you in a season? Do you think I'm going to work my guts out to make you give a few decent performances and then have you go away to play some twopenny-halfpenny part in a commercial play in London? What sort of a bloody fool do you take me for? I'll give you a three years' contract, I'll give you eight pounds a week and you'll have to work like a horse.”

“Eight pounds a week's absurd. I couldn't possibly take that.”

“Oh, yes, you could. It's all you're worth and it's all you're going to get.”

Julia had been on the stage for three years and had learnt a good deal. Besides, Jane Taitbout, no strict moralist, had given her a lot of useful information.

“And are you under the impression, by any chance, that for that I'm going to let you sleep with me as well?”

“My God, do you think I've got time to go to bed with the members of my company? I've got much more important things to do than that, my girl. And you'll find that after you've rehearsed for four hours and played a part at night to my satisfaction, besides a couple of matinées, you won't have much time or much inclination to make love to anybody. When you go to bed all you'll want to do is to sleep.”

But Jimmie Langton was wrong there.





Chapter 3


Julia, taken by his enthusiasm and his fantastic exuberance, accepted his offer. He started her in modest parts which under his direction she played as she had never played before. He interested the critics in her, he flattered them by letting them think that they had discovered a remarkable actress, and allowed the suggestion to come from them that he should let the public see her as Magda. She was a great hit and then in quick succession he made her play Nora in The Doll's House, Ann in Man and Superman, and Hedda Gabler. Middlepool was delighted to discover that it had in its midst an actress who it could boast was better than any star in London, and crowded to see her in plays that before it had gone to only from local patriotism. The London paragraphers mentioned her now and then, and a number of enthusiastic patrons of the drama made the journey to Middlepool to see her. They went back full of praise, and two or three London managers sent representatives to report on her. They were doubtful. She was all very well in Shaw and Ibsen, but what would she do in an ordinary play? The managers had had bitter experiences. On the strength of an outstanding performance in one of these queer plays they had engaged an actor, only to discover that in any other sort of play he was no better than anybody else.

When Michael joined the company Julia had been playing in Middlepool for a year. Jimmie started him with Marchbanks in Candida. It was the happy choice one would have expected him to make, for in that part his great beauty was an asset and his lack of warmth no disadvantage.

Julia reached over to take out the first of the cardboard cases in which Michael's photographs were kept. She was sitting comfortably on the floor. She turned the early photographs over quickly, looking for that which he had had taken when first he came to Middlepool; but when she came upon it, it gave her a pang. For a moment she felt inclined to cry. It had been just like him then. Candida was being played by an older woman, a sound actress who was cast generally for mothers, maiden aunts or character parts, and Julia with nothing to do but act eight times a week attended the rehearsals. She fell in love with Michael at first sight. She had never seen a more beautiful young man, and she pursued him relentlessly. In due course Jimmie put on Ghosts, braving the censure of respectable Middlepool, and Michael played the boy and she played Regina. They heard one another their parts and after rehearsals lunched, very modestly, together so that they might talk of them. Soon they were inseparable. Julia had little reserve; she flattered Michael outrageously. He was not vain of his good looks, he knew he was handsome and accepted compliments, not exactly with indifference, but as he might have accepted a compliment on a fine old house that had been in his family for generations. It was a well-known fact that it was one of the best houses of its period, one was proud of it and took care of it, but it was just there, as natural to possess as the air one breathed. He was shrewd and ambitious. He knew that his beauty was at present his chief asset, but he knew it could not last for ever and was determined to become a good actor so that he should have something besides his looks to depend on. He meant to learn all he could from Jimmie Langton and then go to London.

“If I play my cards well I can get some old woman to back me and go into management. One's got to be one's own master. That's the only way to make a packet.”

Julia soon discovered that he did not much like spending money, and when they ate a meal together, or on a Sunday went for a small excursion, she took care to pay her share of the expenses. She did not mind this. She liked him for counting the pennies, and, inclined to be extravagant herself and always a week or two behind with her rent, she admired him because he hated to be in debt and even with the small salary he was getting managed to save up a little every week. He was anxious to have enough put by so that when he went to London he need not accept the first part that was offered him, but could afford to wait till he got one that gave him a real chance. His father had little more than his pension to live on, and it had been a sacrifice to send him to Cambridge. His father, not liking the idea of his going on the stage, had insisted on this.

“If you want to be an actor I suppose I can't stop you,” he said, “but damn it all, I insist on your being educated like a gentleman.”

It gave Julia a good deal of satisfaction to discover that Michael's father was a colonel, it impressed her to hear him speak of an ancestor who had gambled away his fortune at White's during the Regency, and she liked the signet ring Michael wore with the boar's head on it and the motto: Nemo me impune lacessit.

“I believe you're prouder of your family than of looking like a Greek god,” she told him fondly.

“Anyone can be good-looking,” he answered, with his sweet smile, “but not everyone can belong to a decent family. To tell you the truth I'm glad my governor's a gentleman.”

Julia took her courage in both hands.

“My father's a vet.”

For an instant Michael's face stiffened, but he recovered himself immediately and laughed.

“Of course it doesn't really matter what one's father is. I've often heard my father talk of the vet in his regiment. He counted as an officer of course. Dad always said he was one of the best.”

And she was glad he'd been to Cambridge. He had rowed for his College and at one time there was some talk of putting him in the university boat.

“I should have liked to get my blue. It would have been useful to me on the stage. I'd have got a lot of advertisement out of it.”

Julia could not tell if he knew that she was in love with him. He never made love to her. He liked her society and when they found themselves with other people scarcely left her side. Sometimes they were asked to parties on Sunday, dinner at midday or a cold, sumptuous supper, and he seemed to think it natural that they should go together and come away together. He kissed her when he left her at her door, but he kissed her as he might have kissed the middle-aged woman with whom he had played Candida. He was friendly, good-humoured and kind, but it was distressingly clear that she was no more to him than a comrade. Yet she knew that he was not in love with anybody else. The love-letters that women wrote to him he read out to Julia with a chuckle, and when they sent him flowers he immediately gave them to her.

“What blasted fools they are,” he said. “What the devil do they think they're going to get out of it?”

“I shouldn't have thought it very hard to guess that,” said Julia dryly.

Although she knew he took these attentions so lightly she could not help feeling angry and jealous.

“I should be a damned fool if I got myself mixed up with some woman in Middlepool. After all, they're mostly flappers. Before I knew where I was I'd have some irate father coming along and saying, now you must marry the girl.”

She tried to find out whether he had had any adventures while he was playing with Benson's company. She gathered that one or two of the girls had been rather inclined to make nuisances of themselves, but he thought it was a terrible mistake to get mixed up with any of the actresses a chap was playing with. It was bound to lead to trouble.

“And you know how people gossip in a company. Everyone would know everything in twenty-four hours. And when you start a thing like that you don't know what you're letting yourself in for. I wasn't risking anything.”

When he wanted a bit of fun he waited till they were within a reasonable distance of London and then he would race up to town and pick up a girl at the Globe Restaurant. Of course it was expensive, and when you came to think of it, it wasn't really worth the money; besides, he played a lot of cricket in Benson's company, and golf when he got the chance, and that sort of thing was rotten for the eye.

Julia told a thumping lie.

“Jimmie always says I'd be a much better actress if I had an affair.”

“Don't you believe it. He's just a dirty old man. With him, I suppose. I mean, you might just as well say that I'd give a better performance of Marchbanks if I wrote poetry.”

They talked so much together that it was inevitable for her at last to learn his views on marriage.

“I think an actor's a perfect fool to marry young. There are so many cases in which it absolutely ruins a chap's career. Especially if he marries an actress. He becomes a star and then she's a millstone round his neck. She insists on playing with him, and if he's in management he has to give her leading parts, and if he engages someone else there are most frightful scenes. And of course for an actress it's insane. There's always the chance of her having a baby and she may have to refuse a damned good part. She's out of the public eye for months, and you know what the public is, unless they see you all the time they forget that you ever existed.”

Marriage? What did she care about marriage? Her heart melted within her when she looked into his deep, friendly eyes, and she shivered with delightful anguish when she considered his shining, russet hair. There was nothing that he could have asked her that she would not gladly have given him. The thought never entered his lovely head.

“Of course he likes me,” she said to herself. “He likes me better than anyone, he even admires me, but I don't attract him that way.”

She did everything to seduce him except slip into bed with him, and she only did not do that because there was no opportunity. She began to fear that they knew one another too well for it to seem possible that their relations should change, and she reproached herself bitterly because she had not rushed to a climax when first they came in contact with one another. He had too sincere an affection for her now ever to become her lover. She found out when his birthday was and gave him a gold cigarette case which she knew was the thing he wanted more than anything in the world. It cost a good deal more than she could afford and he smilingly reproached her for her extravagance. He never dreamt what ecstatic pleasure it gave her to spend her money on him. When her birthday came along he gave her half a dozen pairs of silk stockings. She noticed at once that they were not of very good quality, poor lamb, he had not been able to bring himself to spring to that, but she was so touched that he should give her anything that she could not help crying.

“What an emotional little thing you are,” he said, but he was pleased and touched to see her tears.

She found his thrift rather an engaging trait. He could not bear to throw his money about. He was not exactly mean, but he was not generous. Once or twice at restaurants she thought he undertipped the waiter, but he paid no attention to her when she ventured to remonstrate. He gave the exact ten percent, and when he could not make the exact sum to a penny asked the waiter for change.

“‘Neither a borrower nor a lender be,’” he quoted from Polonius.

When some member of the company, momentarily hard up, tried to borrow from him it was in vain. But he refused so frankly, with so much heartiness, that he did not affront.

“My dear old boy, I'd love to lend you a quid, but I'm absolutely stony. I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent at the end of the week.”

For some months Michael was so much occupied with his own parts that he failed to notice how good an actress Julia was. Of course he read the reviews, and their praise of Julia, but he read summarily, without paying much attention till he came to the remarks the critics made about him. He was pleased by their approval, but not cast down by their censure. He was too modest to resent an unfavourable criticism.

“I suppose I was rotten,” he would say ingenuously.

His most engaging trait was his good humour. He bore Jimmie Langton's abuse with equanimity. When tempers grew frayed during a long rehearsal he remained serene. It was impossible to quarrel with him. One day he was sitting in front watching the rehearsal of an act in which he did not appear. It ended with a powerful and moving scene in which Julia had the opportunity to give a fine display of acting. When the stage was being set for the next act Julia came through the pass door and sat down beside Michael. He did not speak to her, but looked sternly in front of him. She threw him a surprised look. It was unlike him not to give her a smile and a friendly word. Then she saw that he was clenching his jaw to prevent its trembling and that his eyes were heavy with tears.

“What's the matter, darling?”

“Don't talk to me. You dirty little bitch, you've made me cry.”

“Angel!”

The tears came to her own eyes and streamed down her face. She was so pleased, so flattered.

“Oh, damn it,” he sobbed. “I can't help it.”

He took a handkerchief out of his pocket and dried his eyes.

(“I love him, I love him, I love him.”)

Presently he blew his nose.

“I'm beginning to feel better now. But, my God, you shattered me.”

“It's not a bad scene, is it?”

“The scene be damned, it was you. You just wrung my heart. The critics are right, damn it, you're an actress and no mistake.”

“Have you only just discovered it?”

“I knew you were pretty good, but I never knew you were as good as all that. You make the rest of us look like a piece of cheese. You're going to be a star. Nothing can stop you.”

“Well then, you shall be my leading man.”

“Fat chance I'd have of that with a London manager.”

Julia had an inspiration.

“Then you must go into management yourself and make me your leading lady.”

He paused. He was not a quick thinker and needed a little time to let a notion sink into his mind. He smiled.

“You know that's not half a bad idea.”

They talked it over at luncheon. Julia did most of the talking while he listened to her with absorbed interest.

“Of course the only way to get decent parts consistently is to run one's own theatre,” he said. “I know that.”

The money was the difficulty. They discussed how much was the least they could start on. Michael thought five thousand pounds was the minimum. But how in heaven's name could they raise a sum like that? Of course some of those Middlepool manufacturers were rolling in money, but you could hardly expect them to fork out five thousand pounds to start a couple of young actors who had only a local reputation. Besides, they were jealous of London.

“You'll have to find your rich old woman,” said Julia gaily.

She only half believed all she had been saying, but it excited her to discuss a plan that would bring her into a close and constant relation with Michael. But he was being very serious.

“I don't believe one could hope to make a success in London unless one were pretty well known already. The thing to do would be to act there in other managements for three or four years first; one's got to know the ropes. And the advantage of that would be that one would have had time to read plays. It would be madness to start in management unless one had at least three plays. One of them out to be a winner.”

“Of course if one did that, one ought to make a point of acting together so that the public got accustomed to seeing the two names on the same bill.”

“I don't know that there's much in that. The great thing is to have good, strong parts. There's no doubt in my mind that it would be much easier to find backers if one had made a bit of a reputation in London.”





Chapter 4


It was getting on for Easter, and Jimmie Langton always closed his theatre for Holy Week. Julia did not quite know what to do with herself; it seemed hardly worth while to go to Jersey. She was surprised to receive a letter one morning from Mrs. Gosselyn, Michael's mother, saying that it would give the Colonel and herself so much pleasure if she would come with Michael to spend the week at Cheltenham. When she showed the letter to Michael he beamed.

“I asked her to invite you. I thought it would be more polite than if I just took you along.”

“You are sweet. Of course I shall love to come.”

Her heart beat with delight. The prospect of spending a whole week with Michael was enchanting. It was just like his good nature to come to the rescue when he knew she was at a loose end. But she saw there was something he wanted to say, yet did not quite like to.

“What is it?”

He gave a little laugh of embarrassment.

“Well, dear, you know, my father's rather old-fashioned, and there are some things he can't be expected to understand. Of course I don't want you to tell a lie or anything like that, but I think it would seem rather funny to him if he knew your father was a vet. When I wrote and asked if I could bring you down I said he was a doctor.”

“Oh, that's all right.”

Julia found the Colonel a much less alarming person than she had expected. He was thin and rather small, with a lined face and close-cropped white hair. His features had a worn distinction. He reminded you of a head on an old coin that had been in circulation too long. He was civil, but reserved. He was neither peppery nor tyrannical as Julia, from her knowledge of the stage, expected a colonel to be. She could not imagine him shouting out words of command in that courteous, rather cold voice. He had in point of fact retired with honorary rank after an entirely undistinguished career, and for many years had been content to work in his garden and play bridge at his club. He read The Times, went to church on Sunday and accompanied his wife to tea-parties. Mrs. Gosselyn was a tall, stoutish, elderly woman, much taller than her husband, who gave you the impression that she was always trying to diminish her height. She had the remains of good looks, so that you said to yourself that when young she must have been beautiful. She wore her hair parted in the middle with a bun on the nape of her neck. Her classic features and her size made her at first meeting somewhat imposing, but Julia quickly discovered that she was very shy. Her movements were stiff and awkward. She was dressed fussily, with a sort of old-fashioned richness which did not suit her. Julia, who was entirely without self-consciousness, found the elder woman's deprecating attitude rather touching. She had never known an actress to speak to and did not quite know how to deal with the predicament in which she now found herself. The house was not at all grand, a small detached stucco house in a garden with a laurel hedge, and since the Gosselyns had been for some years in India there were great trays of brass ware and brass bowls, pieces of Indian embroidery and highly carved Indian tables. It was cheap bazaar stuff and you wondered how anyone had thought it worth bringing home.

Julia was quick-witted. It did not take her long to discover that the Colonel, notwithstanding his reserve, and Mrs. Gosselyn, notwithstanding her shyness, were taking stock of her. The thought flashed through her mind that Michael had brought her down for his parents to inspect her. Why? There was only one possible reason, and when she thought of it her heart leaped. She saw that he was anxious for her to make a good impression. She felt instinctively that she must conceal the actress, and without effort, without deliberation, merely because she felt it would please, she played the part of the simple, modest, ingenuous girl who had lived a quiet country life. She walked round the garden with the Colonel and listened intelligently while he talked of peas and asparagus; she helped Mrs. Gosselyn with the flowers and dusted the ornaments with which the drawing-room was crowded. She talked to her of Michael. She told her howcleverly he acted and how popular he was and she praised his looks. She saw that Mrs. Gosselyn was very proud of him, and with a flash of intuition saw that it would please her if she let her see, with the utmost delicacy, as though she would have liked to keep it a secret but betrayed herself unwittingly, that she was head over ears in love with him.

“Of course we hope he'll do well,” said Mrs. Gosselyn. “We didn't much like the idea of his going on the stage; you see, on both sides of the family, we're army, but he was set on it.”

“Yes, of course I see what you mean.”

“I know it doesn't mean so much as when I was a girl, but after all he was born a gentleman.”

“Oh, but some very nice people go on the stage nowadays, you know. It's not like in the old days.”

“No, I suppose not. I'm so glad he brought you down here. I was a little nervous about it. I thought you'd be made-up and… perhaps a little loud. No one would dream you were on the stage.”

(“I should damn well think not. Haven't I been giving a perfect performance of the village maiden for the last forty-eight hours?”)

The Colonel began to make little jokes with her and sometimes he pinched her ear playfully.

“Now you mustn't flirt with me, Colonel,” she cried, giving him a roguish, delicious glance. “Just because I'm an actress you think you can take liberties with me.”

“George, George,” smiled Mrs. Gosselyn. And then to Julia: “He always was a terrible flirt.”

(“Gosh, I'm going down like a barrel of oysters.”)

Mrs. Gosselyn told her about India, how strange it was to have all those coloured servants, but how nice the society was, only army people and Indian civilians, but still it wasn't like home, and how glad she was to get back to England.

They were to leave on Easter Monday because they were playing that night, and on Sunday evening after supper Colonel Gosselyn said he was going to his study to write letters; a minute or two later Mrs. Gosselyn said she must go and see the cook. When they were left alone Michael, standing with his back to the fire, lit a cigarette.

“I'm afraid it's been very quiet down here; I hope you haven't had an awfully dull time.”

“It's been heavenly.”

“You've made a tremendous success with my people. They've taken an enormous fancy to you.”

“God, I've worked for it,” thought Julia, but aloud said: “How d'you know?”

“Oh, I can see it. Father told me you were very ladylike, and not a bit like an actress, and Mother says you're so sensible.”

Julia looked down as though the extravagance of these compliments was almost more than she could bear. Michael came over and stood in front of her. The thought occurred to her that he looked like a handsome young footman applying for a situation. He was strangely nervous. Her heart thumped against her ribs.

“Julia dear, will you marry me?”

For the last week she had asked herself whether or not he was going to propose to her, and now that he had at last done so, she was strangely confused.

“Michael!”

“Not immediately, I don't mean. But when we've got our feet on the ladder. I know that you can act me off the stage, but we get on together like a house on fire, and when we do go into management I think we'd make a pretty good team. And you know I do like you most awfully. I mean, I've never met anyone who's a patch on you.”

(“The blasted fool, why does he talk all that rot? Doesn't he know I'm crazy to marry him? Why doesn't he kiss me, kiss me, kiss me? I wonder if I dare tell him I'm absolutely sick with love for him.”)

“Michael, you're so handsome. No one could refuse to marry you.”

“Darling!”

(“I'd better get up. He wouldn't know how to sit down. God, that scene that Jimmie made him do over and over again!”)

She got on her feet and put up her face to his. He took her in his arms and kissed her lips.

“I must tell Mother.”

He broke away from her and went to the door.

“Mother, Mother!”

In a moment the Colonel and Mrs. Gosselyn came in. They bore a look of happy expectancy.

(“By God, it was a put-up job.”)

“Mother, Father, we're engaged.”

Mrs. Gosselyn began to cry. With her awkward, lumbering gait she came up to Julia, flung her arms round her, and sobbing, kissed her. The Colonel wrung his son's hand in a manly way and releasing Julia from his wife's embrace kissed her too. He was deeply moved. All this emotion worked on Julia and, though she smiled happily, the tears coursed down her cheeks. Michael watched the affecting scene with sympathy.

“What d'you say to a bottle of pop to celebrate?” he said. “It looks to me as though Mother and Julia were thoroughly upset.”

“The ladies, God bless 'em,” said the Colonel when their glasses were filled.





Chapter 5


Julia now was looking at the photograph of herself in her wedding-dress.

“Christ, what a sight I looked.”

They decided to keep their engagement to themselves, and Julia told no one about it but Jimmie Langton, two or three girls in the company and her dresser. She vowed them to secrecy and could not understand how within forty-eight hours everyone in the theatre seemed to know all about it. Julia was divinely happy. She loved Michael more passionately than ever and would gladly have married him there and then, but his good sense prevailed. They were at present no more than a couple of provincial actors, and to start their conquest of London as a married couple would jeopardize their chances. Julia showed him as clearly as she knew how, and this was very clearly indeed, that she was quite willing to become his mistress, but this he refused. He was too honourable to take advantage of her.

“‘I could not love thee, dear, so much, loved I not honour more,’” he quoted.

He felt sure that when they were married they would bitterly regret it if they had lived together before as man and wife. Julia was proud of his principles. He was a kind and affectionate lover, but in a very short while seemed to take her a trifle for granted; by his manner, friendly but casual, you might have thought they had been married for years. But he showed great good nature in allowing Julia to make love to him. She adored to sit cuddled up to him with his arm round her waist, her face against his, and it was heaven when she could press her eager mouth against his rather thin lips. Though when they sat side by side like that he preferred to talk of the parts they were studying or make plans for the future, he made her very happy. She never tired of praising his beauty. It was heavenly, when she told him how exquisite his nose was and how lovely his russet, curly hair, to feel his hold on her tighten a little and to see the tenderness in his eyes.

“Darling, you'll make me as vain as a peacock.”

“It would be so silly to pretend you weren't divinely handsome.”

Julia thought he was, and she said it because she liked saying it, but she said it also because she knew he liked to hear it. He had affection and admiration for her, he felt at ease with her, and he had confidence in her, but she was well aware that he was not in love with her. She consoled herself by thinking that he loved her as much as he was capable of loving, and she thought that when they were married, when they slept together, her own passion would excite an equal passion in him. Meanwhile she exercised all her tact and all her self-control. She knew she could not afford to bore him. She knew she must never let him feel that she was a burden or a responsibility. He might desert her for a game of golf, or to lunch with a casual acquaintance, but she never let him see for a moment that she was hurt. And with an inkling that her success as an actress strengthened his feeling for her she worked like a dog to play well.

When they had been engaged for rather more than a year an American manager, looking for talent and having heard of Jimmie Langton's repertory company, came to Middlepool and was greatly taken by Michael. He sent him round a note asking him to come to his hotel on the following afternoon.Michael, breathless with excitement, showed it to Julia; it could only mean that he was going to offer him a part. Her heart sank, but she pretended that she was as excited as he, and went with him next day to the hotel. She was to wait in the lobby while Michael saw the great man.

“Wish me luck,” he whispered, as he turned from her to enter the lift. “It's almost too good to be true.”

Julia sat in a great leather armchair willing with all her might the American manager to offer a part that Michael would refuse or a salary that he felt it would be beneath his dignity to accept. Or alternatively that he should get Michael to read the part he had in view and come to the conclusion that he could not touch it. But when she saw Michael coming towards her half an hour later, his eyes bright and his step swinging, she knew he had clicked. For a moment she thought she was going to be sick, and when she forced on her face an eager, happy smile, she felt that her muscles were stiff and hard.

“It's all right. He says it's a damned good part, a boy's part, nineteen. Eight or ten weeks in New York and then on the road. It's a safe forty weeks with John Drew. Two hundred and fifty dollars a week.”

“Oh, darling, how wonderful for you.”

It was quite clear that he had accepted with alacrity. The thought of refusing had never even occurred to him.

“And I—I,” she thought, “if they'd offered me a thousand dollars a week I wouldn't have gone if it meant being separated from Michael.”

Black despair seized her. She could do nothing. She must pretend to be as delighted as he was. He was too much excited to sit still and took her out into the crowded street to walk.

“It's a wonderful chance. Of course America's expensive, but I ought to be able to live on fifty dollars a week at the outside, they say the Americans are awfully hospitable and I shall get a lot of free meals. I don't see why I shouldn't save eight thousand dollars in the forty weeks and that's sixteen hundred pounds.”

(“He doesn't love me. He doesn't care a damn about me. I hate him. I'd like to kill him. Blast that American manager.”)

“And if he takes me on for a second year I'm to get three hundred. That means that in two years I'd have the best part of four thousand pounds. Almost enough to start management on.”

“A second year!” For a moment Julia lost control of herself and her voice was heavy with tears. “D'you mean to say you'll be gone two years?”

“Oh, I should come back next summer of course. They pay my fare back and I'd go and live at home so as not to spend any money.”

“I don't know how I'm going to get on without you.”

She said the words very brightly, so that they sounded polite, but somewhat casual.

“Well, we can have a grand time together in the summer and you know a year, two years at the outside, well, it passes like a flash of lightning.”

Michael had been walking at random, but Julia without his noticing had guided him in the direction she wished, and now they arrived in front of the theatre. She stopped.

“I'll see you later. I've got to pop up and see Jimmie.” His face fell.

“You're not going to leave me now! I must talk to somebody. I thought we might go and have a snack together before the show.”

“I'm terribly sorry. Jimmie's expecting me and you know what he is.”

Michael gave her his sweet, good-natured smile.

“Oh, well, go on then. I'm not going to hold it up against you because for once you've let me down.”

He walked on and she went in by the stage door. Jimmie Langton had arranged himself a tiny flat under the roof to which you gained access through the balcony. She rang the bell of his front door and he opened it himself. He was surprised, but pleased, to see her.

“Hulloa, Julia, come in.”

She walked past him without a word, and when they got into his sitting-room, untidy, littered with typescript plays, books and other rubbish, the remains of his frugal lunch still on a tray by his desk, she turned and faced him. Her jaw was set and her eyes were frowning.

“You devil!”

With a swift gesture she went up to him, seized him by his loose shirt collar with both hands and shook him. He struggled to get free of her, but she was strong and violent.

“Stop it. Stop it.”

“You devil, you swine, you filthy low-down cad.”

He took a swing and with his open hand gave her a great smack on the face. She instinctively loosened her grip on him and put her own hand up to her cheek, for he had hurt her. She burst out crying.

“You brute. You rotten hound to hit a woman.”

“You put that where the monkey put the nuts, dearie. Didn't you know that when a woman hits me I always hit back?”

“I didn't hit you.”

“You damned near throttled me.”

“You deserved it. Oh, my God, I'd like to kill you.”

“Now sit down, duckie, and I'll give you a drop of Scotch to pull you together. And then you can tell me all about it.”

Julia looked round for a big chair into which she could conveniently sink.

“Christ, the place is like a pig-sty. Why the hell don't you get a charwoman in?”

With an angry gesture she swept the books on to the floor from an armchair, threw herself in it, and began to cry in earnest. He poured her out a stiff dose of whisky, added a drop of soda, and made her drink it.

“Now what's all this Tosca stuff about?”

“Michael's going to America.”

“Is he?”

She wrenched herself away from the arm he had round her shoulder. “How could you? How could you?”

“I had nothing to do with it.”

“That's a lie. I suppose you didn't even know that filthy American manager was in Middlepool. Of course it's your doing. You did it deliberately to separate us.”

“Oh, dearie, you're doing me an injustice. In point of fact I don't mind telling you that I said to him he could have anyone in the company he liked with the one exception of Michael Gosselyn.”

Julia did not see the look in Jimmie's eyes when he told her this, but if she had would have wondered why he was looking as pleased as if he had pulled off a very clever little trick.

“Even me?” she said.

“I knew he didn't want women. They've got plenty of their own. It's men they want who know how to wear their clothes and don't spit in the drawing-room.”

“Oh, Jimmie, don't let Michael go. I can't bear it.”

“How can I prevent it? His contract's up at the end of the season. It's a wonderful chance for him.”

“But I love him. I want him. Supposing he sees someone else in America. Supposing some American heiress falls in love with him.”

“If he doesn't love you any more than that I should have thought you'd be well rid of him.”

The remark revived Julia's fury.

“You rotten old eunuch, what do you know about love?”

“These women,” Jimmie sighed. “If you try to go to bed with them they say you're a dirty old man, and if you don't they say you're a rotten old eunuch.”

“Oh, you don't understand. He's so frightfully handsome, they'll fall for him like a row of ninepins, and poor lamb, he's so susceptible to flattery. Anything can happen in two years.”

“What's this about two years?”

“If he's a success he's to stay another year.”

“Well, don't worry your head about that. He'll be back at the end of the season and back for good. That manager only saw him in Candida. It's the only part he's half-way decent in. Take my word for it, it won't be long before they find out they've been sold a pup. He's going to be a flop.”

“What do you know about acting?”

“Everything.”

“I'd like to scratch your eyes out.”

“I warn you that if you attempt to touch me I shan't give you a little bit of a slap, I shall give you such a biff on the jaw that you won't be able to eat in comfort for a week.”

“By God, I believe you'd do it. Do you call yourself a gentleman?”

“Not even when I'm drunk.”

Julia giggled, and Jimmie felt the worst of the scene was over.

“Now you know just as well as I do that you can act him off his head. I tell you, you're going to be the greatest actress since Mrs. Kendal. What do you want to go and hamper yourself with a man who'll always be a mill-stone round your neck? You want to go into management; he'll want to play opposite you. He'll never be good enough, my dear.”

“He's got looks. I can carry him.”

“You've got a pretty good opinion of yourself, haven't you? But you're wrong. If you want to make a success you can't afford to have a leading man who's not up to the mark.”

“I don't care. I'd rather marry him and be a failure than be a success and married to somebody else.”

“Are you a virgin?”

Julia giggled again.

“I don't know that it's any business of yours, but in point of fact I am.”

“I thought you were. Well, unless it means something to you, why don't you go over to Paris with him for a fortnight when we close? He won't be sailing till August. It might get him out of your system.”

“Oh, he wouldn't. He's not that sort of man. You see, he's by way of being a gentleman.”

“Even the upper classes propagate their species.”

“You don't understand,” said Julia haughtily.

“I bet you don't either.”

Julia did not condescend to reply. She was really very unhappy.

“I can't live without him, I tell you. What am I to do with myself when he's away?”

“Stay on with me. I'll give you a contract for another year. I've got a lot of new parts I want to give you and I've got a juvenile in my eye who's a find. You'll be surprised how much easier you'll find it when you've got a chap opposite you who'll really give you something. You can have twelve pounds a week.”

Julia went up to him and stared into his eyes searchingly.

“Have you done all this to get me to stay on for another year? Have you broken my heart and ruined my whole life just to keep me in your rotten theatre?”

“I swear I haven't. I like you and I admire you. And we've done better business the last two years than we've ever done before. But damn it, I wouldn't play you a dirty trick like that.”

“You liar, you filthy liar.”

“I swear it's the truth.”

“Prove it then,” she said violently.

“How can I prove it? You know I'm decent really.”

“Give me fifteen pounds a week and I'll believe you.”

“Fifteen pounds a week? You know what our takings are. How can I? Oh, well, all right. But I shall have to pay three pounds out of my own pocket.”

“A fat lot I care.”





Chapter 6


After a fortnight of rehearsals, Michael was thrown out of the part for which he had been engaged, and for three or four weeks was left to kick his heels about till something else could be found for him. He opened in due course in a play that ran less than a month in New York. It was sent on the road; but languished and was withdrawn. After another wait he was given a part in a costume play where his good looks shone to such advantage that his indifferent acting was little noticed, and in this he finished the season. There was no talk of renewing his contract. Indeed the manager who had engaged him was caustic in his comments.

“Gee, I'd give something to get even with that fellow Langton, the son of a bitch,” he said. “He knew what he was doing all right when he landed me with that stick.”

Julia wrote to Michael constantly, pages and pages of love and gossip, while he answered once a week, four pages exactly in a neat, precise hand. He always ended up by sending her his best love and signing himself hers very affectionately, but the rest of his letter was more informative than passionate. Yet she awaited its coming in an agony of impatience and read it over and over again. Though he wrote cheerfully, saying little about the theatre except that the parts they gave him were rotten and the plays in which he was expected to act beneath contempt, news travels in the theatrical world, and Julia knew that he had not made good.

“I suppose it's beastly of me,” she thought, “but thank God, thank God.”

When he announced the date of his sailing she could not contain her joy. She got Jimmie so to arrange his programme that she might go and meet him at Liverpool.

“If the boat comes in late I shall probably stay the night,” she told Jimmie.

He smiled ironically.

“I suppose you think that in the excitement of homecoming you may work the trick.”

“What a beastly little man you are.”

“Come off it, dear. My advice to you is, get him a bit tight and then lock yourself in a room with him and tell him you won't let him out till he's made a dishonest woman of you.”

But when she was starting he came to the station with her. As she was getting into the carriage he took her hand and patted it.

“Feeling nervous, dear?”

“Oh, Jimmie dear, wild with happiness and sick with anxiety.”

“Well, good luck to you. And don't forget you're much too good for him. You're young and pretty and you're the greatest actress in England.”

When the train steamed out Jimmie went to the station bar and had a whisky and soda. “Lord, what fools these mortals be,” he sighed. But Julia stood up in the empty carriage and looked at herself in the glass.

“Mouth too large, face too puddingy, nose too fleshy. Thank God, I've got good eyes and good legs. Exquisite legs. I wonder if I've got too much make-up on. He doesn't like make-up off the stage. I look bloody without rouge. My eyelashes are all right. Damn it all, I don't look so bad.”

Uncertain till the last moment whether Jimmie would allow her to go Julia had not been able to let Michael know that she was meeting him. He was surprised and frankly delighted to see her. His beautiful eyes beamed with pleasure.

“You're more lovely than ever,” she said.

“Oh, don't be so silly,” he laughed, squeezing her arm affectionately. “You haven't got to go back till after dinner, have you?”

“I haven't got to go back till tomorrow. I've taken a couple of rooms at the Adelphi, so that we can have a real talk.”

“The Adelphi's a bit grand, isn't it?”

“Oh, well, you don't come back from America every day. Damn the expense.”

“Extravagant little thing, aren't you? I didn't know when we'd dock, so I told my people I'd wire when I was getting down to Cheltenham. I'll tell them I'll be coming along tomorrow.”

When they got to the hotel Michael came to Julia's room, at her suggestion, so that they could talk in peace and quiet. She sat on his knees, with her arm round his neck, her cheek against his.

“Oh, it's so good to be home again,” she sighed.

“You don't have to tell me that,” he said, not understanding that she referred to his arms and not to his arrival.

“D'you still like me?”

“Rather.”

She kissed him fondly.

“Oh, you don't know how I've missed you.”

“I was an awful flop in America,” he said. “I didn't tell you in my letters, because I thought it would only worry you. They thought me rotten.”

“Michael,” she cried, as though she could not believe him.

“The fact is, I suppose, I'm too English. They don't want me another year. I didn't think they did, but just as a matter of form I asked them if they were going to exercise their option and they said no, not at any price.”

Julia was silent. She looked deeply concerned, but her heart was beating with exultation.

“I honestly don't care, you know. I didn't like America. It's a smack in the eye of course, it's no good denying that, but the only thing is to grin and bear it. If you only knew the people one has to deal with! Why, compared with some of them, Jimmie Langton's a great gentleman. Even if they had wanted me to stay I should have refused.”

Though he put a brave face on it, Julia felt that he was deeply mortified. He must have had to put up with a good deal of unpleasantness. She hated him to have been made unhappy, but, oh, she was so relieved.

“What are you going to do now?” she asked quietly.

“Well, I shall go home for a bit and think things over. Then I shall go to London and see if I can't get a part.”

She knew that it was no good suggesting that he should come back to Middlepool. Jimmie Langton would not have him.

“You wouldn't like to come with me, I suppose?”

Julia could hardly believe her ears.

“Me? Darling, you know I'd go anywhere in the world with you.”

“Your contract's up at the end of this season, and if you want to get anywhere you've got to make a stab at London soon. I saved every bob I could in America, they all called me a tight-wad but I just let them talk, I've brought back between twelve and fifteen hundred pounds.”

“Michael, how on earth can you have done that?”

“I didn't give much away, you know,” he smiled happily. “Of course it's not enough to start management on, but it's enough to get married on, I mean we'd have something to fall back on if we didn't get parts right away or happened to be out of a job for a few months.”

It took Julia a second or two to understand what he meant.

“D'you mean to say, get married now?”

“Of course it's a risk, without anything in prospect, but one has to take a risk sometimes.”

Julia took his head in both her hands and pressed his lips with hers. Then she gave a sigh.

“Darling, you're wonderful and you're as beautiful as a Greek god, but you're the biggest damned fool I've ever known in my life.”

They went to a theatre that night and at supper drank champagne to celebrate their reunion and toast their future. When Michael accompanied her to her room she held up her face to his.

“D'you want me to say good-night to you in the passage? I'll just come in for a minute.”

“Better not, darling,” she said with quiet dignity.

She felt like a high-born damsel, with all the traditions of a great and ancient family to keep up; her purity was a pearl of great price; she also felt that she was making a wonderfully good impression: of course he was a great gentleman and “damn it all” it behoved her to be a great lady. She was so pleased with her performance that when she had got into her room and somewhat noisily locked the door, she paraded up and down bowing right and left graciously to her obsequious retainers. She stretched out her lily-white hand for the trembling old steward to kiss (as a baby he had often dandled her on his knee), and when he pressed it with his pallid lips she felt something fall upon it. A tear.





Chapter 7


The first year of their marriage would have been stormy except for Michael's placidity. It needed the excitement of getting a part or a first night, the gaiety of a party where he had drunk several glasses of champagne, to turn his practical mind to thoughts of love. No flattery, no allurements, could tempt him when he had an engagement next day for which he had to keep his brain clear or a round of golf for which he needed a steady eye. Julia made him frantic scenes. She was jealous of his friends at the Green Room Club, jealous of the games that took him away from her, and jealous of the men's luncheons he went to under the pretext that he must cultivate people who might be useful to them. It infuriated her that when she worked herself up into a passion of tears he should sit there quite calmly, with his hands crossed and a good-humoured smile on his handsome face, as though she were merely making herself ridiculous.

“You don't think I'm running after any other woman, do you?” he asked.

“How do I know? It's quite obvious that you don't care two straws for me.”

“You know you're the only woman in the world for me.”

“My God!”

“I don't know what you want.”

“I want love. I thought I'd married the handsomest man in England and I've married a tailor's dummy.”

“Don't be so silly. I'm just the ordinary normal Englishman. I'm not an Italian organ-grinder.”

She swept up and down the room. They had a small flat at Buckingham Gate and there was not much space, but she did her best. She threw up her hands to heaven.

“I might be squint-eyed and hump-backed. I might be fifty. Am I so unattractive as all that? It's so humiliating to have to beg for love. Misery, misery.”

“That was a good movement, dear. As if you were throwing a cricket ball. Remember that.”

She gave him a look of scorn.

“That's all you can think of. My heart is breaking, and you can talk of a movement that I made quite accidentally.”

But he saw by the expression of her face that she was registering it in her memory, and he knew that when the occasion arose she would make effective use of it.

“After all love isn't everything. It's all very well at its proper time and in its proper place. We had a lot of fun on our honeymoon, that's what a honeymoon's for, but now we've got to get down to work.”

They had been lucky. They had managed to get fairly good parts together in a play that had proved a success. Julia had one good acting scene in which she had brought down the house, and Michael's astonishing beauty had made a sensation. Michael with his gentlemanly push, with his breezy good-nature, had got them both a lot of publicity and their photographs appeared in the illustrated papers. They were asked to a number of parties and Michael, notwithstanding his thriftiness, did not hesitate to spend money on entertaining people who might be of service. Julia was impressed by his lavishness on these occasions. An actor-manager offered Julia the leading part in his next play, and though there was no part for Michael and she was anxious to refuse it, he would not let her. He said they could not afford to let sentiment stand in the way of business. He eventually got a part in a costume play.

They were both acting when the war broke out. To Julia's pride and anguish Michael enlisted at once, but with the help of his father, one of whose old brother officers was an important personage at the War Office, he very soon got a commission. When he went out to France Julia bitterly regretted the reproaches she had so often heaped upon him, and made up her mind that if he were killed she would commit suicide. She wanted to become a nurse so that she could go out to France too and at least be on the same soil as he, but he made her understand that patriotism demanded that she should go on acting, and she could not resist what might very well be his dying request. Michael thoroughly enjoyed the war. He was popular in the regimental mess, and the officers of the old army accepted him almost at once, even though he was an actor, as one of themselves. It was as though the family of soldiers from which he was born had set a seal on him so that he fell instinctively into the manner and way of thinking of the professional soldier. He had tact and a pleasant manner, and he knew how to pull strings adroitly; it was inevitable that he should get on the staff of some general. He showed himself possessed of considerable organizing capacity and the last three years of the war he passed at G.H.Q. He ended it as a major, with the Military Cross and the Legion of Honour.

Meanwhile Julia had been playing a succession of important parts and was recognized as the best of the younger actresses. Throughout the war the theatre was very prosperous, and she profited by being seen in plays that had long runs. Salaries went up, and with Michael to advise her she was able to extort eighty pounds a week from reluctant managers. Michael came over to England on his leaves and Julia was divinely happy. Though he was in no more danger than if he had been sheep-farming in New Zealand, she acted as though the brief periods he spent with her were the last days the doomed man would ever enjoy on earth. She treated him as though he had just come from the horror of the trenches and was tender, considerate, and unexacting.

It was just before the end of the war that she fell out of love with him.

She was pregnant at the time. Michael had judged it imprudent to have a baby just then, but she was nearly thirty and thought that if they were going to have one at all they ought to delay no longer; she was so well-established on the stage that she could afford not to appear for a few months, and with the possibility that Michael might be killed at any moment—it was true he said he was as safe as a house, he only said that to reassure her, and even generals were killed sometimes—if she was to go on living she must have a child by him. The baby was expected at the end of the year.

She looked forward to Michael's next leave as she had never done before. She was feeling very well, but she had a great yearning to feel his arms around her, she felt a little lost, a little helpless, and she wanted his protective strength. He came, looking wonderfully handsome in his well-cut uniform, with the red tabs and the crown on his shoulder-straps. He had filled out a good deal as the result of the hardships of G.H.Q. and his skin was tanned. With his close-cropped hair, breezy manner and military carriage he looked every inch a soldier. He was in great spirits, not only because he was home for a few days, but because the end of the war was in sight. He meant to get out of the army as quickly as possible. What was the good of having a bit of influence if you didn't use it? So many young men had left the stage, either from patriotism or because life was made intolerable for them by the patriotic who stayed at home, and finally owing to conscription, that leading parts had been in the hands either of people who were inapt for military service or those who had been so badly wounded that they had got their discharge. There was a wonderful opening, and Michael saw that if he were available quickly he could get his choice of parts. When he had recalled himself to the recollection of the public they could look about for a theatre, and with the reputation Julia had now acquired it would be safe to start in management.

They talked late into the night and then they went to bed. She cuddled up to him voluptuously and he put his arms round her. After three months of abstinence he was amorous.

“You're the most wonderful little wife,” he whispered.

He pressed his mouth on hers. She was filled on a sudden with a faint disgust. She had to resist an inclination to push him away. Before, to her passionate nostrils his body, his young beautiful body, had seemed to have a perfume of flowers and honey, and this had been one of the things that had most enchained her to him, but now in some strange way it had left him. She realized that he no longer smelt like a youth, he smelt like a man. She felt a little sick. She could not respond to his ardour, she was eager that he should get his desire satisfied quickly, turn over on his side, and go to sleep. For long she lay awake. She was dismayed. Her heart sank because she knew she had lost something that was infinitely precious to her, and pitying herself she was inclined to cry; but at the same time she was filled with a sense of triumph, it seemed a revenge that she enjoyed for the unhappiness he had caused her; she was free of the bondage in which her senses had held her to him and she exulted. Now she could deal with him on equal terms. She stretched her legs out in bed and sighed with relief.

“By God, it's grand to be one's own mistress.”

They had breakfast in their room, Julia in bed and Michael seated at a little table by her side. She looked at him while he read the paper. Was it possible that three months had made so much difference in him, or was it merely that for years she had still seen him with the eyes that had seen him when he came on the stage to rehearse at Middlepool in the glorious beauty of his youth and she had been stricken as with a mortal sickness? He was wonderfully handsome still, after all he was only thirty-six, but he was not a boy any more; with his close-cropped hair and weather-beaten skin, little lines beginning to mark the smoothness of his forehead and to show under his eyes, he was definitely a man. He had lost his coltish grace and his movements were set. Each difference was very small, but taken altogether they amounted, in her shrewd, calculating eyes, to all the difference in the world. He was a middle-aged man.

They still lived in the small flat that they had taken when first they came to London. Though Julia had been for some time earning a good income it had not seemed worth while to move while Michael was on active service, but now that a baby was coming the flat was obviously too small. Julia had found a house in Regent's Park that she liked very much. She wanted to be settled down in good time for her confinement.

The house faced the gardens. Above the drawing-room floor were two bedrooms and above these two rooms that could be made into a day and a night nursery. Michael was pleased with everything; even the price seemed to him reasonable. Julia had, during the last four years, been earning so much more money than he that she had offered to furnish the house herself. They stood in one of the bedrooms.

“I can make do with a good deal of what we've got for my bedroom,” she said. “I'll get you a nice suite at Maple's.”

“I wouldn't go to much expense,” he smiled. “I don't suppose I shall use it much, you know.”

He liked to share a bed with her. Though not passionate he was affectionate, and he had an animal desire to feel her body against his. For long it had been her greatest comfort. The thought now filled her with irritation.

“Oh, I don't think there should be any more nonsense till after the baby's born. Until all that's over and done with I'm going to make you sleep by yourself.”

“I hadn't thought of that. If you think it's better for the kid…”





Chapter 8


Michael got himself demobbed the moment the war was finished and stepped straight into a part. He returned to the stage a much better actor than he left it. The breeziness he had acquired in the army was effective. He was a well set-up, normal, high-spirited fellow, with a ready smile and a hearty laugh. He was well-suited to drawing-room comedy. His light voice gave a peculiar effect to a flippant line, and though he never managed to make love convincingly he could carry off a chaffing love scene, making a proposal as if it were rather a joke, or a declaration as though he were laughing at himself, in a manner that the audience found engaging. He never attempted to play anyone but himself. He specialized in men about town, gentlemanly gamblers, guardsmen and young scamps with a good side to them. Managers liked him. He worked hard and was amenable to direction. So long as he could get work he didn't mind much what sort of part it was. He stuck out for the salary he thought he was worth, but if he couldn't get it was prepared to take less rather than be idle.

He was making his plans carefully. During the winter that followed the end of the war there was an epidemic of influenza. His father and mother died. He inherited nearly four thousand pounds, and this with his own savings and Julia's brought up their joint capital to seven thousand. But the rent of theatres had gone up enormously, the salaries of actors and the wages of stage-hands had increased, so that the expense of running a theatre was very much greater than it had been before the war. A sum that would then have been amply sufficient to start management on was now inadequate. The only thing was to find some rich man to go in with them so that a failure or two to begin with would not drive them from the field. It was said that you could always find a mug in the city to write a fat cheque for the production of a play, but when you came down to business you discovered that the main condition was that the leading part should be played by some pretty lady in whom he was interested. Years before, Michael and Julia had often joked about the rich old woman who would fall in love with him and set him up in management. He had long since learnt that no rich old woman was to be found to set up in management a young actor whose wife was an actress to whom he was perfectly faithful. In the end the money was found by a rich woman, and not an old one either, but who was interested not in him but in Julia.

Mrs. de Vries was a widow. She was a short stout woman with a fine Jewish nose and fine Jewish eyes, a great deal of energy, a manner at once effusiveand timid, and a somewhat virile air. She had a passion for the stage. When Julia and Michael had decided to try their luck in London Jimmie Langton, to whose rescue she had sometimes come when it looked as though he would be forced to close his repertory theatre, had written to her asking her to do what she could for them. She had seen Julia act in Middlepool. She gave parties so that the young actors might get to know managers, and asked them to stay at her grand house near Guildford, where they enjoyed a luxury they had never dreamt of. She did not much like Michael. Julia accepted the flowers with which Dolly de Vries filled her flat and her dressing-room, she was properly delighted with the presents she gave her, bags, vanity cases, strings of beads in semiprecious stones, brooches; but appeared to be unconscious that Dolly's generosity was due to anything but admiration for her talent. When Michael went away to the war Dolly pressed her to come and live in her house in Montagu Square, but Julia, with protestations of extravagant gratitude, refused in such a way that Dolly, with a sigh and a tear, could only admire her the more. When Roger was born Julia asked her to be his godmother.

For some time Michael had been turning over in his mind the possibility that Dolly de Vries might put up the money they needed, but he was shrewd enough to know that while she might do it for Julia she would not do it for him. Julia refused to approach her.

“She's already been so kind to us I really couldn't ask her, and it would be so humiliating if she refused.”

“It's a good gamble, and even if she lost the money she wouldn't feel it. I'm quite sure you could get round her if you tried.”

Julia was pretty sure she could too. Michael was very simpleminded in some ways; she did not feel called upon to point out to him the obvious facts.

But he was not a man who let a thing drop when he had set his mind to it. They were going to Guildford to spend the weekend with Dolly, and were driving down after the Saturday night's performance in the new car that Julia had given Michael for his birthday. It was a warm beautiful night. Michael had bought options, though it wrung his heart to write the cheques, on three plays that they both liked, and he had heard of a theatre that they could get on reasonable terms. Everything was ready for the venture except the capital. He urged Julia to seize the opportunity that the weekend presented.

“Ask her yourself then,” said Julia impatiently. “I tell you, I'm not going to.”

“She wouldn't do it for me. You can twist her round your little finger.”

“We know a thing or two about financing plays now. People finance plays for two reasons, either because they want notoriety, or because they're in love with someone. A lot of people talk about art, but you don't often find them paying out hard cash unless they're going to get something out of it for themselves.”

“Well, we'll give Dolly all the notoriety she wants.”

“That doesn't happen to be what she's after.”

“What do you mean?”

“Can't you guess?”

Light dawned on him, and he was so surprised that he slowed down. Was it possible that what Julia suspected was true? He had never even thought that Dolly liked him much, and as for supposing she was in love with him—why, the notion had never crossed his mind. Of course Julia had sharp eyes, not much got by her, but she was a jealous little thing, she was always thinking women were making a dead set at him. It was true that Dolly had given him a pair of cuff links at Christmas, but he thought that was only so that he shouldn't feel left out in the cold because she had given Julia a brooch that much have cost at least two hundred pounds. That might be only her cunning. Well, he could honestly say he'd never done a thing to make her think there was anything doing. Julia giggled.

“No, darling, it's not you she's in love with.”

It was disconcerting the way Julia knew what he was thinking. You couldn't hide a thing from that woman.

“Then why did you put the idea into my head? I wish to goodness you'd express yourself so that a fellow can understand.”

Julia did.

“I never heard such nonsense,” he cried. “What a filthy mind you've got, Julia!”

“Come off it, dear.”

“I don't believe there's a word of truth in it. After all I've got eyes in my head. Do you mean to say I shouldn't have noticed it?” He was more irritable than she had ever known him. “And even if it were true I suppose you can take care of yourself. It's a chance in a thousand, and I think it would be madness not to take it.”

“Claudio and Isabella in Measure for Measure.”

“That's a rotten thing to say, Julia. God damn it, I am a gentleman.”

“‘Nemo me impune lacessit.’”

They drove the rest of the journey in stormy silence. Mrs. de Vries was waiting up for them.

“I didn't want to go to bed till I'd seen you,” she said as she folded Julia in her arms and kissed her on both cheeks. She gave Michael a brisk handshake.

Julia spent a happy morning in bed reading the Sunday papers. She read first the theatrical news, then the gossip columns, after that the woman's pages, and finally cast an eye over the headlines of the world's news. The book reviews she ignored; she could never understand why so much space was wasted on them. Michael, who had the room next hers, had come in to say good-morning, and then gone out into the garden. Presently there was a timid little knock at her door and Dolly came in. Her great black eyes were shining. She sat on the bed and took Julia's hand.

“Darling, I've been talking to Michael. I'm going to put up the money to start you in management.”

Julia's heart gave a sudden beat.

“Oh, you mustn't. Michael shouldn't have asked you. I won't have it. You've been far, far too kind to us already.”

Dolly leant over and kissed Julia on the lips. Her voice was lower than usual and there was a little tremor in it.

“Oh, my love, don't you know there isn't anything in the world I wouldn't do for you? It'll be so wonderful; it'll bring us so close together and I shall be so proud of you.”

They heard Michael come whistling along the passage, and when he came into the room Dolly turned to him with her great eyes misty with tears.

“I've just told her.”

He was brimming over with excitement.

“What a grand woman!” He sat down on the other side of the bed and took Julia's disengaged hand. “What d'you say, Julia?”

She gave him a little reflective look.

“‘Vous l'avez voulu, Georges Dandin.’”

“What's that?”

“Molière.”

As soon as the deed of partnership had been signed and Michael had got his theatre booked for the autumn he engaged a publicity agent. Paragraphs were sent to the papers announcing the new venture and Michael and the publicity agent prepared interviews for him and Julia to give to the Press. Photographs of them, singly and together, with and without Roger, appeared in the weeklies. The domestic note was worked for all it was worth. They could not quite make up their minds which of the three plays they had it would be best to start with. Then one afternoon when Julia was sitting in her bedroom reading a novel, Michael came in with a manuscript in his hand.

“Look here, I want you to read this play at once. It's just come in from an agent. I think it's a knock-out. Only we've got to give an answer right away.”

Julia put down her novel.

“I'll read it now.”

“I shall be downstairs. Let me know when you've finished and I'll come up and talk it over with you. It's got a wonderful part for you.”

Julia read quickly, skimming over the scenes in which she was not concerned, but the principal woman's part, the part of course she would play, with concentration. When she had turned the last page she rang the bell and asked her maid (who was also her dresser) to tell Michael she was ready for him.

“Well, what d'you think?”

“The play's all right. I don't see how it can fail to be a success.”

He caught something doubtful in her tone.

“What's wrong then? The part's wonderful. I mean, it's the sort of thing that you can do better than anyone in the world. There's a lot of comedy and all the emotion you want.”

“It's a wonderful part, I know that; it's the man's part.”

“Well, that's a damned good part too.”

“I know; but he's fifty, and if you make him younger you take all the point out of the play. You don't want to take the part of a middle-aged man.”

“But I wasn't thinking of playing that. There's only one man for that. Monte Vernon. And we can get him. I'll play George.”

“But that's a tiny part. You can't play that.”

“Why not?”

“But I thought the point of going into management was that we should both play leads.”

“Oh, I don't care a hang about that. As long as we can find plays with star parts for you I don't matter. Perhaps in the next play there'll be a good part for me too.”

Julia leant back in her chair and the ready tears filled her eyes and ran down her cheeks.

“Oh, what a beast I am.”

He smiled, and his smile was as charming as ever. He came over to her and kneeling by her side put his arms round her.

“Lor Lumme, what's the matter with the old lady now?”

When she looked at him now she wondered what there was in him that had ever aroused in her such a frenzy of passion. The thought of having sexual relations with him nauseated her. Fortunately he found himself very comfortable in the bedroom she had furnished for him. He was not a man to whom sex was important, and he was relieved when he discovered that Julia no longer made any demands on him. He thought with satisfaction that the birth of the baby had calmed her down, he was bound to say that he had thought it might, and he was only sorry they had not had one before. When he had two or three times,more out of amiability than out of desire, suggested that they should resume marital relations and she had made excuses, either that she was tired, not very well, or had two performances next day, to say nothing of a fitting in the morning, he accepted the situation with equanimity. Julia was much easier to get on with, she never made scenes any more, and he was happier than he had ever been before. It was a damned satisfactory marriage he had made, and when he looked at other people's marriages he couldn't help seeing he was one of the lucky ones. Julia was a damned good sort and clever, as clever as a bagful of monkeys; you could talk to her about anything in the world. The best companion a chap ever had, my boy. He didn't mind saying this, he'd rather spend a day alone with her than play a round of golf.

Julia was surprised to discover in herself a strange feeling of pity for him because she no longer loved him. She was a kindly woman, and she realized that it would be a bitter blow to his pride if he ever had an inkling how little he meant to her. She continued to flatter him. She noticed that for long now he had come to listen complacently to her praise of his exquisite nose and beautiful eyes. She got a little private amusement by seeing how much he could swallow. She laid it on with a trowel. But now she looked more often at his straight thin-lipped mouth. It grew meaner as he grew older, and by the time he was an old man it would be no more than a cold hard line. His thrift, which in the early days had seemed an amusing, rather touching trait, now revolted her. When people were in trouble, and on the stage they too often are, they got sympathy and kind friendly words from Michael, but very little cash. He looked upon himself as devilish generous when he parted with a guinea, and a five-pound note was to him the extreme of lavishness. He had soon discovered that Julia ran the house extravagantly, and insisting that he wanted to save her trouble took the matter in his own hands. After that nothing was wasted. Every penny was accountedfor. Julia wondered why servants stayed with them. They did because Michael was so nice to them. With his hearty, jolly, affable manner he made them anxious to please him, and the cook shared his satisfaction when she had found a butcher from whom they could get meat a penny a pound cheaper than elsewhere. Julia could not but laugh when she thought how strangely his passion for economy contrasted with the devil-may-care, extravagant creatures he portrayed so well on the stage. She had often thought that he was incapable of a generous impulse; and now, as though it were the most natural thing in the world, he was prepared to stand aside so that she might have her chance. She was too deeply moved to speak. She reproached herself bitterly for all the unkind things she had for so long been thinking of him.





Chapter 9


They put on the play, and it was a success. After that they continued to produce plays year after year. Because Michael ran the theatre with the method and thrift with which he ran his home they lost little over the failures, which of course they sometimes had, and made every possible penny out of their successes. Michael flattered himself that there was not a management in London where less money was spent on the productions. He exercised great ingenuity in disguising old sets so that they looked new, and by ringing the changes on the furniture that he gradually collected in the store-room saved the expense of hiring. They gained the reputation of being an enterprising management because Michael, in order not to pay the high royalties of well-known authors, was always willing to give an unknown one a trial. He sought out actors who had never been given a chance and whose salaries were small. He thus made some very profitable discoveries.

When they had been in management for three years they were sufficiently well-established for Michael to be able to borrow from the bank enough money to buy the lease of a theatre that had just been built. After much discussion they decided to call it the Siddons Theatre. They opened with a failure and this was succeeded by another. Julia was frightened and discouraged. She thought that the theatre was unlucky and that the public were getting sick of her. It was then that Michael showed himself at his best. He was unperturbed.

“In this business you have to take the rough with the smooth. You're the best actress in England. There are only three people who bring money into the theatre regardless of the play, and you're one of them. We've had a couple of duds. The next play's bound to be all right and then we shall get back all we've lost and a packet into the bargain.”

As soon as Michael had felt himself safe he had tried to buy Dolly de Vries out, but she would not listen to his persuasion and was indifferent to his coldness. For once his cunning found its match. Dolly saw no reason to sell out an investment that seemed sound, and her half share in the partnership kept her in close touch with Julia. But now with great courage he made another effort to get rid of her. Dolly indignantly refused to desert them when they were in difficulties, and he gave it up as a bad job. He consoled himself by thinking that Dolly might leave Roger, her godson, a great deal of money. She had no one belonging to her but nephews in South Africa, and you could not look at her without suspecting that she had a high blood pressure. Meanwhile it was convenient to have the house near Guildford to go to whenever they wished. It saved the expense of having a country house of their own. The third play was a winner, and Michael did not hesitate to point out how right he had been. He spoke as though he was directly responsible for its success. Julia could almost have wished that it had failed like the others in order to take him down a peg or two. For his conceit was outrageous. Of course you had to admit that he had a sort of cleverness, shrewdness rather, but he was not nearly so clever as he thought himself. There was nothing in which he did not think that he knew better than anybody else.

As time went on he began to act less frequently. He found himself much more interested in management.

“I want to run my theatre in as businesslike a way as a city office,” he said.

And he felt that he could more profitably spend his evenings, when Julia was acting, by going to outlying theatres and trying to find talent. He kept a little book in which he made a note for every actor who seemed to show promise. Then he had taken to directing. It had always grizzled him that directors should ask so much money for rehearsing a play, and of late some of them had even insisted on a percentage on the gross. At last an occasion came when the two directors Julia liked best were engaged and the only other one she trusted was acting and thus could not give them all his time.

“I've got a good mind to have a shot at it myself,” said Michael.

Julia was doubtful. He had no fantasy and his ideas were commonplace. She was not sure that he would have authority over the cast. But the only available director demanded a fee that they both thought exorbitant and there was nothing left but to let Michael try. He made a much better job of it than Julia expected. He was thorough; he worked hard. Julia, strangely enough, felt that he was getting more out of her than any other director had done. He knew what she was capable of, and, familiar with her every inflection, every glance of her wonderful eyes, every graceful movement of her body, he was able to give hersuggestions out of which she managed to build up the best performance of her career. With the cast he was at once conciliatory and exacting. When tempers were frayed his good-humour, his real kindliness, smoothed things over. After that there was no question but that he should continue to direct their plays. Authors liked him because, being unimaginative, he was forced to let the plays speak for themselves and often not being quite sure what they meant he was obliged to listen to them.

Julia was now a rich woman. She could not but admit that Michael was as careful of her money as of his own. He watched her investments and was as pleased when he could sell stocks at a profit on her account as if he had made the money for himself. He put her down for a very large salary, and was proud to be able to say that she was the most highly-paid actress in London, but when he himself acted he never put himself down for a higher salary than he thought the part was worth. When he directed a play he put down on the expense account the fee that a director of the second rank would have received. They shared the expenses of the house and the cost of Roger's education. Roger had been entered for Eton within a week of his birth. It was impossible to deny that Michael was scrupulously fair and honest. When Julia realized how much richer she was than he she wanted to pay all these expenses herself.

“There's no reason why you should,” said Michael. “As long as I can pay my whack I'll pay it. You earn more than I do because you're worth more. I put you down for a good salary because you draw it.”

No one could do other than admire the self-abnegation with which he sacrificed himself for her sake. Any ambition he may have had for himself he had abandoned in order to foster her career. Even Dolly, who did not like him, acknowledged his unselfishness. A sort of modesty had always prevented Julia from discussing him with Dolly, but Dolly, with her shrewdness, had long seen how intensely Michael exasperated his wife, and now and then took the trouble to point out how useful he was to her. Everybody praised him. A perfect husband. It seemed to her that none but she knew what it was like to live with a man who was such a monster of vanity. His complacency when he had beaten an opponent at golf or got the better of someone in a business deal was infuriating. He gloried in his artfulness. He was a bore, a crashing bore. He liked to tell Julia everything he did and every scheme that passed through his head; it had been charming when merely to have him with her was a delight, but for years she had found his prosiness intolerable. He could describe nothing without circumstantial detail. Nor was he only vain of his business acumen; with advancing years he had become outrageously vain of his person. As a youth he had taken his beauty for granted: now he began to pay more attention to it and spared no pains to keep what was left of it. It became an obsession. He devoted anxious care to his figure. He never ate a fattening thing and never forgot his exercises. He consulted hair specialists when he thought his hair was thinning, and Julia was convinced that had it been possible to get the operation done secretly he would have had his face lifted. He had got into the way of sitting with his chin slightly thrust out so that the wrinkles in his neck should not show and he held himself with an arched back to keep his belly from sagging. He could not pass a mirror without looking into it. He hankered for compliments and beamed with delight when he had managed to extract one. They were food and drink to him. Julia laughed bitterly when she remembered that it was she who had accustomed him to them. For years she had told him how beautiful he was and now he could not live without flattery. It was the only chink in his armour. An actress out of a job had only to tell him to his face that he was too handsome to be true for him to think that she might do for a part he had in mind. For years, so far as Julia knew, Michael had not bothered with women, but when he reached the middle forties he began to have little flirtations. Julia suspected that nothing much came of them. He was prudent, and all he wanted was admiration. She had heard that when women became pressing he used her as a pretext to get rid of them. Either he couldn't risk doing anything to hurt her, or she was jealous or suspicious and it seemed better that the friendship should cease.

“God knows what they see in him,” Julia exclaimed to the empty room.

She took up half-a-dozen of his later photographs at random and looked at them carefully one by one. She shrugged her shoulders.

“Well, I suppose I can't blame them. I fell in love with him too. Of course he was better-looking in those days.”

It made Julia a little sad to think how much she had loved him. Because her love had died she felt that life had cheated her. She sighed.

“And my back's aching,” she said.





Chapter 10


There was a knock at the door.

“Come in,” said Julia.

Evie entered.

“Aren't you going to bed today, Miss Lambert?” She saw Julia sitting on the floor surrounded by masses of photographs. “Whatever are you doing?”

“Dreaming.” She took up two of the photographs. “Look here upon this picture, and on this.”

One was of Michael as Mercutio in all the radiant beauty of his youth and the other of Michael in the last part he had played, in a white topper and a morning coat, with a pair of field glasses slung over his shoulder. He looked unbelievably self-satisfied.

Evie sniffed.

“Oh, well, it's no good crying over spilt milk.”

“I've been thinking of the past and I'm as blue as the devil.”

“I don't wonder. When you start thinking of the past it means you ain't got no future, don't it?”

“You shut your trap, you old cow,” said Julia, who could be very vulgar when she chose.

“Come on now, or you'll be fit for nothing tonight. I'll clear up all this mess.”

Evie was Julia's dresser and maid. She had come to her first at Middlepool and had accompanied her to London. She was a cockney, a thin, raddled, angular woman, with red hair which was always untidy and looked as if it much needed washing; two of her front teeth were missing but notwithstanding Julia's offer, repeated for years, to provide her with new ones she would not have them replaced.

“For the little I eat I've got all the teeth I want. It'd only fidget me to 'ave a lot of elephant's tusks in me mouth.”

Michael had long wanted Julia at least to get a maid whose appearance was more suitable to their position, and he had tried to persuade Evie that the work was too much for her, but Evie would not hear of it.

“You can say what you like, Mr. Gosselyn, but no one's going to maid Miss Lambert as long as I've got me 'ealth and strength.”

“We're all getting on, you know, Evie. We're not so young as we were.”

Evie drew her forefinger across the base of her nostrils and sniffed.

“As long as Miss Lambert's young enough to play women of twenty-five, I'm young enough to dress 'er. And maid 'er.” Evie gave him a sharp look. “An' what d'you want to pay two lots of wages for, when you can get the work done for one?”

Michael chuckled in his good-humoured way.

“There's something in that, Evie dear.”

She bustled Julia upstairs. When she had no matinée Julia went to bed for a couple of hours in the afternoon and then had a light massage. She undressed now and slipped between the sheets.

“Damn, my hot water bottle's nearly stone cold.”

She looked at the clock on the chimney-piece. It was no wonder. It must have been there an hour. She had no notion that she had stayed so long in Michael's room, looking at those photographs and idly thinking of the past.

“Forty-six. Forty-six. Forty-six. I shall retire when I'm sixty. At fifty-eight South Africa and Australia. Michael says we can clean up there. Twenty thousand pounds. I can play all my old parts. Of course even at sixty I could play women of forty-five. But what about parts? Those bloody dramatists.”

Trying to remember any plays in which there was a first-rate part for a woman of five-and-forty she fell asleep. She slept soundly till Evie came to awake her because the masseuse was there. Evie brought her the evening paper, and Julia, stripped, while the masseuse rubbed her long slim legs and her belly, putting on her spectacles, read the same theatrical intelligence she had read that morning, the gossip column and the woman's page. Presently Michael came in and sat on her bed. He often came at that hour to have a little chat with her.

“Well, what was his name?” asked Julia.

“Whose name?”

“The boy who came to lunch?”

“I haven't a notion. I drove him back to the theatre. I never gave him another thought.”

Miss Phillips, the masseuse, liked Michael. You knew where you were with him. He always said the same things and you knew exactly what to answer. No side to him. And terribly good-looking. My word.

“Well, Miss Phillips, fat coming off nicely?”

“Oh, Mr. Gosselyn, there's not an ounce of fat on Miss Lambert. I think it's wonderful the way she keeps her figure.”

“Pity I can't have you to massage me, Miss Phillips. You might be able to do something about mine.”

“How you talk, Mr. Gosselyn. Why, you've got the figure of a boy of twenty. I don't know how you do it, upon my word I don't.”

“Plain living and high thinking, Miss Phillips.”

Julia was paying no attention to what they said, but Miss Phillips's reply reached her.

“Of course there's nothing like massage, I always say that, but you've got to be careful of your diet. That there's no doubt about at all.”

“Diet!” she thought. “When I'm sixty I shall let myself go. I shall eat all the bread and butter I like. I'll have hot rolls for breakfast, I'll have potatoes for lunch and potatoes for dinner. And beer. God, how I like beer. Pea soup and tomato soup; treacle pudding and cherry tart. Cream, cream, cream. And so help me God, I'll never eat spinach again as long as I live.”

When the massage was finished Evie brought her a cup of tea, a slice of ham from which the fat had been cut, and some dry toast. Julia got up, dressed, and went down with Michael to the theatre. She liked to be there an hour before the curtain rang up. Michael went on to dine at his club. Evie had preceded her in a cab and when she got into her dressing-room everything was ready for her. She undressed once more and put on a dressing-gown. As she sat down at her dressing-table to make up she noticed some fresh flowers in a vase.

“Hulloa, who sent them? Mrs. de Vries?”

Dolly always sent her a huge basket on her first nights, and on the hundredth night, and the two hundredth if there was one, and in between, whenever she ordered flowers for her own house, had some sent to Julia.

“No, miss.”

“Lord Charles?”

Lord Charles Tamerley was the oldest and the most constant of Julia's admirers, and when he passed a florist's he was very apt to drop in and order some roses for her.

“Here's the card,” said Evie.

Julia looked at it. Mr. Thomas Fennell. Tavistock Square.

“What a place to live. Who the hell d'you suppose he is, Evie?”

“Some feller knocked all of a heap by your fatal beauty, I expect.”

“They must have cost all of a pound. Tavistock Square doesn't look very prosperous to me. For all you know he may have gone without his dinner for a week to buy them.”

“I don't think.”

Julia plastered her face with grease paint.

“You're so damned unromantic, Evie. Just because I'm not a chorus girl you can't understand why anyone should send me flowers. And God knows, I've got better legs than most of them.”

“You and your legs,” said Evie.

“Well, I don't mind telling you I think it's a bit of all right having an unknown young man sending me flowers at my time of life. I mean it just shows you.”

“If he saw you now 'e wouldn't, not if I know anything about men.”

“Go to hell,” said Julia.

But when she was made up to her satisfaction, and Evie had put on her stockings and her shoes, having a few minutes still to spare she sat down at her desk and in her straggling bold hand wrote to Mr. Thomas Fennell a gushing note of thanks for his beautiful flowers. She was naturally polite and it was besides a principle with her to answer all fan letters. That was how she kept in touch with her public. Having addressed the envelope she threw the card in the waste-paper basket and was ready to slip into the first-act dress. The call-boy came round knocking at the dressing-room doors.

“Beginners, please.”

Those words, though heaven only knew how often she had heard them, still gave her a thrill. They braced her like a tonic. Life acquired significance. She was about to step from the world of make-believe into the world of reality.





Chapter 11


Next day Julia had lunch with Charles Tamerley. His father, the Marquess of Dennorant, had married an heiress and he had inherited a considerable fortune. Julia often went to the lunch parties he was fond of giving at his house in Hill Street. At the bottom of her heart she had a profound contempt for the great ladies and the noble lords she met there, because she was a working woman and an artist, but she knew the connection was useful. It enabled them tohave first nights at the Siddons which the papers described as brilliant, and when she was photographed at weekend parties among a number of aristocratic persons she knew that it was good publicity. There were one or two leading ladies, younger than she, who did not like her any better because she called at least two duchesses by their first names. This caused her no regret. Julia was not a brilliant conversationalist, but her eyes were so bright, her manner so intelligent, that once she had learnt the language of society she passed for a very amusing woman. She had a great gift of mimicry, which ordinarily she kept in check thinking it was bad for her acting, but in these circles she turned it to good account and by means of it acquired the reputation of a wit. She was pleased that they liked her, these smart, idle women, but she laughed at them up her sleeve because they were dazzled by her glamour. She wondered what they would think if they really knew how unromantic the life of a successful actress was, the hard work it entailed, the constant care one had to take of oneself and the regular, monotonous habits which were essential. But she good-naturedly offered them advice on make-up and let them copy her clothes. She was always beautifully dressed. Even Michael, fondly thinking she got her clothes for nothing, did not know how much she really spent on them.

Morally she had the best of both worlds. Everyone knew that her marriage with Michael was exemplary. She was a pattern of conjugal fidelity. At the same time many people in that particular set were convinced that she was Charles Tamerley's mistress. It was an affair that was supposed to have been going on so long that it had acquired respectability, and tolerant hostesses when they were asked to the same house for a weekend gave them adjoining rooms. This belief had been started by Lady Charles, from whom Charles Tamerley had been long separated, and in point of fact there was not a word of truth in it. The only foundation for it was that Charles had been madly in love with her for twenty years, and it was certainly on Julia's account that the Tamerleys, who had never got on very well, agreed to separate. It was indeed Lady Charles who had first brought Julia and Charles together. They happened, all three, to be lunching at Dolly de Vries' when Julia, a young actress, had made her first great success in London. It was a large party and she was being made much of. Lady Charles, a woman of over thirty then, who had the reputation of being a beauty, though except for her eyes she had not a good feature, but by a sort of brazen audacity managed to produce an effective appearance, leant across the table with a gracious smile.

“Oh, Miss Lambert, I think I used to know your father in Jersey. He was a doctor, wasn't he? He used to come to our house quite often.”

Julia felt a slight sickness in the pit of her stomach; she remembered now who Lady Charles was before she married, and she saw the trap that was being set for her. She gave a rippling laugh.

“Not at all,” she answered. “He was a vet. He used to go to your house to deliver the bitches. The house was full of them.”

Lady Charles for a moment did not quite know what to say.

“My mother was very fond of dogs,” she answered.

Julia was glad that Michael was not there. Poor lamb, he would have been terribly mortified. He always referred to her father as Dr Lambert, pronouncing it as though it were a French name, and when soon after the war he died and her mother went to live with her widowed sister at St. Malo he began to speak of her as Madame de Lambert. At the beginning of her career Julia had been somewhat sensitive on the point, but when once she was established as a great actress she changed her mind. She was inclined, especially among the great, to insist on the fact that her father had been a vet. She could not quite have explained why, but she felt that by so doing she put them in their place.

But Charles Tamerley knew that his wife had deliberately tried to humiliate the young woman, and angered, went out of his way to be nice to her. He asked her if he might be allowed to call and brought her some beautiful flowers.

He was then a man of nearly forty, with a small head on an elegant body, not very good-looking but of distinguished appearance. He looked very well-bred, which indeed he was, and he had exquisite manners. He was an amateur of the arts. He bought modem pictures and collected old furniture. He was a lover of music and exceedingly well-read. At first it amused him to go to the tiny flat off the Buckingham Palace Road in which these two young actors lived. He saw that they were poor and it excited him to get into touch with what he fondly thought was Bohemia. He came several times and he thought it quite an adventure when they asked him to have a lunch with them which was cooked and served by a scarecrow of a woman whom they called Evie. This was life. He did not pay much attention to Michael who seemed to him, notwithstanding his too-obvious beauty, a somewhat ordinary young man, but he was taken by Julia. She had a warmth, a force of character, and a bubbling vitality which were outside his experience. He went to see her act several times and compared her performance with his recollections of the great foreign actresses. It seemed to him that she had in her something quite individual. Her magnetism was incontestable. It gave him quite a thrill to realize on a sudden that she had genius.

“Another Siddons perhaps. A greater Ellen Terry.”

In those days Julia did not think it necessary to go to bed in the afternoons, she was as strong as a horse and never tired, so he used often to take her for walks in the Park. She felt that he wanted her to be a child of nature. That suited her very well. It was no effort for her to be ingenuous, frank and girlishly delighted with everything. He took her to the National Gallery, and the Tate, and the British Museum, and she really enjoyed it almost as much as she said. He liked to impart information and she was glad to receive it. She had a retentive memory and learnt a great deal from him. If later she was able to talk about Proust and Cézanne with the best of them, so that you were surprised and pleased to find so much culture in an actress, it was to him she owed it. She knew that he had fallen in love with her some time before he knew it himself. She found it rather comic. From her standpoint he was a middle-aged man, and she thought of him as a nice old thing. She was madly in love with Michael. When Charles realized that he loved her his manner changed a little, he seemed struck with shyness and when they were together was often silent.

“Poor lamb,” she said to herself, “he's such a hell of a gentleman he doesn't know what to do about it.”

But she had already prepared her course of conduct for the declaration which she felt he would sooner or later bring himself to make. One thing she was going to make quite clear to him. She wasn't going to let him think that because he was a lord and she was an actress he had only to beckon and she would hop into bed with him. If he tried that sort of thing she'd play the outraged heroine on him, with the outflung arm and the index extended in the same line, as Jane Taitbout had taught her to make the gesture, pointed at the door. On the other hand if he was shattered and tongue-tied, she'd be all tremulous herself, sobs in the voice and all that, and she'd say it had never dawned on her that he felt like that about her, and no, no, it would break Michael's heart. They'd have a good cry together and then everything would be all right. With his beautiful manners she could count upon him not making a nuisance of himself when she had once got it into his head that there was nothing doing.

But when it happened it did not turn out in the least as she had expected. Charles Tamerley and Julia had been for a walk in St. James's Park, they had looked at the pelicans, and the scene suggesting it, they had discussed the possibility of her playing Millamant on a Sunday evening. They went back to Julia's flat to have a cup of tea. They shared a crumpet. Then Charles got up to go. He took a miniature out of his pocket and gave it to her.

“It's a portrait of Clairon. She was an eighteenth-century actress and she had many of your gifts.”

Julia looked at the pretty, clever face, with the powdered hair, and wondered whether the stones that framed the little picture were diamonds or only paste.

“Oh, Charles, how can you! You are sweet.”

“I thought you might like it. It's by way of being a parting present.”

“Are you going away?”

She was surprised, for he had said nothing about it. He looked at her with a faint smile.

“No. But I'm not going to see you any more.”

“Why?”

“I think you know just as well as I do.”

Then Julia did a disgraceful thing. She sat down and for a minute looked silently at the miniature. Timing it perfectly, she raised her eyes till they met Charles's. She could cry almost at will, it was one of her most telling accomplishments, and now without a sound, without a sob, the tears poured down her cheeks. With her mouth slightly open, with the look in her eyes of a child that has been deeply hurt and does not know why, the effect was unbearably pathetic. His face was crossed by a twinge of agony. When he spoke his voice was hoarse with emotion.

“You're in love with Michael, aren't you?”

She gave a little nod. She tightened her lips as though she were trying to control herself, but the tears rolled down her cheeks.

“There's no chance for me at all?” He waited for some answer from her, but she gave none, she raised her hand to her mouth and seemed to bite a nail, and still she stared at him with those streaming eyes. “Don't you know what torture it is to go on seeing you? D'you want me to go on seeing you?”

Again she gave a little nod.

“Clara's making me scenes about you. She's found out I'm in love with you. It's only common sense that we shouldn't see one another any more.”

This time Julia slightly shook her head. She gave a sob. She leant back in the chair and turned her head aside. Her whole body seemed to express the hopelessness of her grief. Flesh and blood couldn't stand it. Charles stepped forward and sinking to his knees took that broken woe-begone body in his arms.

“For God's sake don't look so unhappy. I can't bear it. Oh, Julia, Julia, I love you so much, I can't make you so miserable. I'll accept anything. I'll make no demands on you.”

She turned her tear-stained face to him (“God, what a sight I must look now”) and gave him her lips. He kissed her tenderly. It was the first time he had ever kissed her.

“I don't want to lose you,” she muttered huskily.

“Darling, darling!”

“It'll be just as it was before?”

“Just.”

She gave a deep sigh of contentment and for a minute or two rested in his arms. When he went away she got up and looked in the glass.

“You rotten bitch,” she said to herself.

But she giggled as though she were not in the least ashamed and then went into the bathroom to wash her face and eyes. She felt wonderfully exhilarated. She heard Michael come in and called out to him.

“Michael, look at that miniature Charles has just given me. It's on the chimney-piece. Are those diamonds or paste?”

Julia was somewhat nervous when Lady Charles left her husband. She threatened to bring proceedings for divorce, and Julia did not at all like the idea of appearing as intervenor. For two or three weeks she was very jittery. She decided to say nothing to Michael till it was necessary, and she was glad she had not, for in due course it appeared that the threats had been made only to extract more substantial alimony from the innocent husband. Julia managed Charles with wonderful skill. It was understood between them that her great love for Michael made any close relation between them out of the question, but so far as the rest was concerned he was everything to her, her friend, her adviser, her confidant, the man she could rely on in any emergency or go to for comfort in any disappointment. It was a little more difficult when Charles, with his fine sensitiveness, saw that she was no longer in love with Michael. Then Julia had to exercise a great deal of tact. It was not that she had any scruples about being his mistress; if he had been an actor who loved her so much and had loved her so long she would not have minded popping into bed with him out of sheer good-nature; but she just did not fancy him. She was very fond of him, but he was so elegant, so well-bred, so cultured, she could not think of him as a lover. It would be like going to bed with an objet d'art. And his love of art filled her with a faint derision; after all she was a creator, when all was said and done he was only the public. He wished her to elope with him. They would buy a villa at Sorrento on the bay of Naples, with a large garden, and they would have a schooner so that they could spend long days on the beautiful wine-coloured sea. Love and beauty and art; the world well lost.

“The damned fool,” she thought. “As if I'd give up my career to bury myself in some hole in Italy!”

She persuaded him that she had a duty to Michael, and then there was the baby; she couldn't let him grow up with the burden on his young life that his mother was a bad woman. Orange trees or no orange trees, she would never have a moment's peace in that beautiful Italian villa if she was tortured by the thought of Michael's unhappiness and her baby being looked after by strangers. One couldn't only think of oneself, could one? One had to think of others too. She was very sweet and womanly. She sometimes asked Charles why he did not arrange a divorce with his wife and marry some nice woman. She could not bear the thought of his wasting his life over her. He told her that she was the only woman he had ever loved and that he must go on loving her till the end.

“It seems so sad,” said Julia.

All the same she kept her eyes open, and if she noticed that any woman had predatory intentions on Charles she took care to queer her pitch. She did not hesitate if the danger seemed to warrant it to show herself extremely jealous. It had been long agreed, with all the delicacy that might be expected from his good breeding and Julia's good heart, in no definite words, but with guarded hints and remote allusiveness, that if anything happened to Michael, Lady Charles should somehow or other be disposed of and they would then marry. But Michael had perfect health.

On this occasion Julia had much enjoyed lunching at Hill Street. The party had been very grand. Julia had never encouraged Charles to entertain any of the actors or authors he sometimes came across, and she was the only person there who had ever had to earn a living. She had sat between an old, fat, bald and loquacious Cabinet Minister who took a great deal of trouble to entertain her, and a young Duke of Westreys who looked like a stable-boy and who flattered himself that he knew French slang better than a Frenchman. When he discovered that Julia spoke French he insisted on conversing with her in that language. After lunch she was persuaded to recite a tirade from Phèdre as it was done at the Comédie Française and the same tirade as an English student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art would deliver it. She made the company laugh very much and came away from the party flushed with success. It was a fine bright day and she made up her mind to walk from Hill Street to Stanhope Place. A good many people recognized her as she threaded her way through the crowd in Oxford Street, and though she looked straight ahead of her she was conscious of their glances.

“What a hell of a nuisance it is that one can't go anywhere without people staring at one.”

She slackened her pace a little. It certainly was a beautiful day.

She let herself into her house with a latch-key and as she got in heard the telephone ringing. Without thinking she took up the receiver.

“Yes?”

She generally disguised her voice when she answered, but for once forgot to.

“Miss Lambert?”

“I don't know if Miss Lambert's in. Who is it please?” she asked, assuming quickly a cockney accent.

The monosyllable had betrayed her. A chuckle travelled over the wire.

“I only wanted to thank you for writing to me. You know, you needn't have troubled. It was so nice of you to ask me to lunch, I thought I'd like to send you a few flowers.”

The sound of his voice and the words told her who it was. It was the blushing young man whose name she did not know. Even now, though she had looked at his card, she could not remember it. The only thing that had struck her was that he lived in Tavistock Square.

“It was very sweet of you,” she answered, in her own voice.

“I suppose you wouldn't come to tea with me one day, would you?”

The nerve of it! She wouldn't go to tea with a duchess; he was treating her like a chorus girl. It was rather funny when you came to think of it.

“I don't know why not.”

“Will you really?” His voice sounded eager. He had a pleasant voice. “When?”

She did not feel at all like going to bed that afternoon.

“Today.”

“OK. I'll get away from the office. Half-past four? 138, Tavistock Square.”

It was nice of him to have suggested that. He might so easily have mentioned some fashionable place where people would stare at her. It proved that he didn't just want to be seen with her.

She took a taxi to Tavistock Square. She was pleased with herself. She was doing a good action. It would be wonderful for him in after years to be able to tell his wife and children that Julia Lambert had been to tea with him when he was just a little insignificant clerk in an accountant's office. And she had been so simple and so natural. No one to hear her prattling away would have guessed that she was the greatest actress in England. And if they didn't believe him he'd have her photograph to prove it, signed yours sincerely. He'd laugh and say that of course if he hadn't been such a kid he'd never have had the cheek to ask her.

When she arrived at the house and had paid off the taxi she suddenly remembered that she did not know his name and when the maid answered the door would not know whom to ask for. But on looking for the bell she noticed that there were eight of them, four rows of two, and by the side of each was a card or a name written in ink on a piece of paper. It was an old house that had been divided up into flats. She began looking, rather hopelessly, at the names wondering whether one of them would recall something, when the door opened and he stood before her.

“I saw you drive up and I ran down. I'm afraid I'm on the third floor. I hope you don't mind.”

“Of course not.”

She climbed the uncarpeted stairs. She was a trifle out of breath when she came to the third landing. He had skipped up eagerly, like a young goat, she thought, and she had not liked to suggest that she would prefer to go more leisurely. The room into which he led her was fairly large, but dingily furnished. On the table was a plate of cakes and two cups, a sugar basin and a milk-jug. The crockery was of the cheapest sort.

“Take a pew,” he said. “the water's just on the boil. I'll only be a minute. I've got a gas-ring in the bathroom.”

He left her and she looked about.

“Poor lamb, he must be as poor as a church mouse.”

The room reminded her very much of some of the lodgings she had lived in when she was first on the stage. She noticed the pathetic attempts he had made to conceal the fact that it was a bedroom as well as a sitting-room. The divan against the wall was evidently his bed at night. The years slipped away from her in fancy and she felt strangely young again. What fun they had had in rooms very like that and how they had enjoyed the fantastic meals they had had, things in paper bags and eggs and bacon fried on the gas-ring! He came in with the tea in a brown pot. She ate a square spongecake with pink icing on it. That was a thing she had not done for years. The Ceylon tea, very strong, with milk and sugar in it, took her back to days she thought she had forgotten. She saw herself as a young, obscure, struggling actress. It was rather delicious. It needed a gesture, but she could only think of one: she took off her hat and gave her head a shake.

They talked. He seemed shy, much shyer than he had seemed over the telephone; well, that was not to be wondered at, now she was there he must be rather overcome, and she set herself to put him at his ease. He told her that his parents lived at Highgate, his father was a solicitor, and he had lived there too, but he wanted to be his own master and now in the last year of his articles he had broken away and taken this tiny flat. He was working for his final examination. They talked of the theatre. He had seen her in every play she had acted in since he was twelve years old. He told her that once when he was fourteen he had stood outside the stage door after a matinée and when she came out had asked her to sign her name in his autograph-book. He was sweet with his blue eyes and pale-brown hair. It was a pity he plastered it down like that. He had a white skin and rather a high colour; she wondered if he was consumptive. Although his clothes were cheap he wore them well, she liked that, and he looked incredibly clean.

She asked him why he had chosen Tavistock Square. It was central, he explained, and he liked the trees. It was quite nice when you looked out of the window. She got up to look, that would be a good way to make a move, then she would put on her hat and say good-bye to him.

“Yes, it is rather charming, isn't it. It's so London; it gives one a sort of jolly feeling.”

She turned to him, standing by her side, as she said this. He put his arm round her waist and kissed her full on the lips. No woman was ever more surprised in her life. She was so taken aback that she never thought of doing anything. His lips were soft and there was a perfume of youth about him which was really rather delightful. But what he was doing was preposterous. He was forcing her lips apart with the tip of his tongue and now he had both arms round her. She did not feel angry, she did not feel inclined to laugh, she did not know what she felt. And now she had a notion that he was gently drawing her along, his lips still pressing hers, she felt quite distinctly the glow of his body, it was as though there was a furnace inside him, it was really remarkable; and then she found herself laid on the divan and he was beside her, kissing her mouth and her neck and her cheeks and her eyes. Julia felt a strange pang in her heart. She took his head in her hands and kissed his lips.

A few minutes later she was standing at the chimney-piece, in front of the looking-glass, making herself tidy.

“Look at my hair.”

He handed her a comb and she ran it through. Then she put on her hat. He was standing just behind her, and over her shoulder she saw his face with those eager blue eyes and a faint smile in them.

“And I thought you were such a shy young man,” she said to his reflection.

He chuckled.

“When am I going to see you again?”

“Do you want to see me again?”

“Rather.”

She thought rapidly. It was too absurd, of course she had no intention of seeing him again, it was stupid of her to have let him behave like that, but it was just as well to temporize. He might be tiresome if she told him that the incident would have no sequel.

“I'll ring up one of these days.”

“Swear.”

“On my honour.”

“Don't be too long.”

He insisted on coming downstairs with her and putting her into a cab. She had wanted to go down alone, so that she could have a look at the cards attached to the bells on the lintel.

“Damn it all, I ought at least to know his name.”

But he gave her no chance. When the taxi drove off she sank into one corner of it and gurgled with laughter.

“Raped, my dear. Practically raped. At my time of life. And without so much as a by-your-leave. Treated me like a tart. Eighteenth-century comedy, that's what it is. I might have been a waiting-maid. In a hoop, with those funny puffy things—what the devil are they called?—that they wore to emphasize their hips, an apron and a scarf round me neck.” Then with vague memories of Farquhar and Goldsmith she invented the dialogue. “La, sir, 'tis shame to take advantage of a poor country girl. What would Mrs. Abigail, her ladyship's woman, say an she knew her ladyship's brother had ravished me of the most precious treasure a young woman in my station of life can possess, videlicet her innocence. Fie, o fie, sir.”

When Julia got home the masseuse was already waiting for her. Miss Phillips and Evie were having a chat.

“Wherever 'ave you been, Miss Lambert?” said Evie. “An' what about your rest, I should like to know.”

“Damn my rest.”

Julia tore off her clothes, and flung them with ample gestures all over the room. Then, stark naked, she skipped on to the bed, stood up on it for a moment, like Venus rising from the waves, and then throwing herself down stretched herself out.

“What's the idea?” said Evie.

“I feel good.”

“Well, if I behaved like that people'd say I'd been drinkin'.”

Miss Phillips began to massage her feet. She rubbed gently, to rest and not to tire her.

“When you came in just now, like a whirlwind,” she said, “I thought you looked twenty years younger. Your eyes were shining something wonderful.”

“Oh, keep that for Mr. Gosselyn, Miss Phillips.” And then as an afterthought, “I feel like a two-year-old.”

And it was the same at the theatre later on. Archie Dexter, who was her leading man, came into her dressing-room to speak about something. She had just finished making-up. He was startled.

“Hulloa, Julia, what's the matter with you tonight? Gosh, you look swell. Why, you don't look a day more than twenty-five.”

“With a son of sixteen it's no good pretending I'm so terribly young any more. I'm forty and I don't care who knows it.”

“What have you done to your eyes? I've never seen them shine like that before.”

She felt in tremendous form. They had been playing the play, it was called The Powder Puff, for a good many weeks, but tonight Julia played it as though it were the first time. Her performance was brilliant. She got laughs that she had never got before. She always had magnetism, but on this occasion it seemed to flow over the house in a great radiance. Michael happened to be watching the last two acts from the corner of a box and at the end he came into her dressing-room.

“D'you know the prompter says we played nine minutes longer tonight, they laughed so much.”

“Seven curtain calls. I thought the public were going on all night.”

“Well, you've only got to blame yourself, darling. There's no one in the world who could have given the performance you gave tonight.”

“To tell you the truth I was enjoying myself. Christ, I'm hungry. What have we got for supper?”

“Tripe and onions.”

“Oh, how divine!” She flung her arms round his neck and kissed him. “I adore tripe and onions. Oh, Michael, Michael, if you love me, if you've got any spark of tenderness in that hard heart of yours, let me have a bottle of beer.”

“Julia.”

“Just this once. It's not often 1 ask you to do anything for me.”

“Oh, well, after the performance you gave tonight I suppose I can't say no, but by God, I'll see that Miss Phillips pitches into you tomorrow.”





Chapter 12


When Julia got to bed and slipped her feet down to the comfort of her hot-water bottle, she took a happy look at her room, rose-pink and Nattier-blue, with the gold cherubs of her dressing-table, and sighed with satisfaction. She thought how very Madame de Pompadour it was. She put out the light but she did not feel at all sleepy. She would have liked really to go to Quag's and dance, but not to dance with Michael, to dance with Louis XV or Ludwig of Bavaria or Alfred de Musset. Clairon and the Bal de l'Opéra. She remembered the miniature Charles had once given her. That was how she felt tonight. Such an adventure had not happened to her for ages. The last time was eight years before. That was an episode that she ought to have been thoroughly ashamed of; goodness, how scared she'd been afterwards, but she had in point of fact never been able to think of it since without a chuckle.

That had been an accident too. She had been acting for a long time without a rest and she badly needed one. The play she was in was ceasing to attract and they were about to start rehearsing a new one when Michael got the chance of letting the theatre to a French company for six weeks. It seemed a good opportunity for Julia to get away. Dolly had rented a house at Cannes for the season and Julia could stay with her. It was just before Easter when she started off, and the trains south were so crowded that she had not been able to get a sleeper, but at Cook's they had said that it would be quite all right and there would be one waiting for her at the station in Paris. To her consternation she found when they got to Paris that nothing seemed to be known about her, and the chef de train told her that every sleeper was engaged. The only chance was that someone should not turn up at the last moment. She did not like the idea of sitting up all night in the corner of a first-class carriage, and went in to dinner with a perturbed mind. She was given a table for two, and soon a man came and sat down opposite her. She paid no attention to him. Presently the chef de train came along and told her that he was very sorry, but he could do nothing for her. She made a useless scene. When the official had gone, the man at her table addressed her. Though he spoke fluent, idiomatic French, she recognized by his accent that he was not a Frenchman. She told him in answer to his polite enquiry the whole story and gave him her opinion of Cook's, the railway company, and the general inefficiency of the human race. He was very sympathetic. He told her that after dinner he would go along the train and see for himself if something could not be arranged. One never knew what one of the conductors could not manage for a tip.

“I'm simply tired out,” she said. “I'd willingly give five hundred francs for a sleeper.”

The conversation thus started, he told her that he was an attaché at the Spanish Embassy in Paris and was going down to Cannes for Easter. Though she had been talking to him for a quarter of an hour she had not troubled to notice what he was like. She observed now that he had a beard, a black curly beard and a black curly moustache, but the beard grew rather oddly on his face; there were two bare patches under the corners of his mouth. It gave him a curious look. With his black hair, drooping eyelids and rather long nose, he reminded her of someone she had seen. Suddenly she remembered, and it was such a surprise that she blurted out:

“D'you know, I couldn't think who you reminded me of. You're strangely like Titian's portrait of Francis I in the Louvre.”

“With his little pig's eyes?”

“No, not them, yours are large, I think it's the beard chiefly.”

She glanced at the skin under his eyes; it was faintly violet and unwrinkled. Notwithstanding the ageing beard he was quite a young man; he could not have been more than thirty. She wondered if he was a Spanish grandee. He was not very well-dressed, but then foreigners often weren't, his clothes might have cost a lot even if they were badly cut, and his tie, though rather loud, she recognised as a Charvet. When they came to the coffee he asked her whether he might offer her a liqueur.

“That's very kind of you. Perhaps it'll make me sleep better.”

He offered her a cigarette. His cigarette-case was silver, that put her off a little, but when he closed it she saw that in the corner was a small crown in gold. He must be a count or something. It was rather chic, having a silver cigarette-case with a gold crown on it. Pity he had to wear those modern clothes! If he'd been dressed like Francis I he would really look very distinguished. She set herself to be as gracious as she knew how.

“I think I should tell you,” he said presently, “that I know who you are. And may I add that I have a great admiration for you?”

She gave him a lingering look of her splendid eyes.

“You've seen me act?”

“Yes, I was in London last month.”

“An interesting little play, wasn't it?”

“Only because you made it so.”

When the man came round to collect the money she had to insist on paying her own bill. The Spaniard accompanied her to the carriage and then said he would go along the train to see if he could find a sleeper for her. He came back in a quarter of an hour with a conductor and told her that he had got her a compartment and if she would give the conductor her things he would take her to it. She was delighted. He threw down his hat on the seat she vacated and she followed him along the corridor. When they reached the compartment he told the conductor to take the portmanteau and the dispatch-case that were in the rack to the carriage madame had just left.

“But it's not your own compartment you're giving up to me?” cried Julia.

“It's the only one on the train.”

“Oh, but I won't hear of it.”

“Allez,” the Spaniard said to the conductor.

“No, no.”

The conductor, on a nod from the stranger, took the luggage away.

“I don't matter. I can sleep anywhere, but I shouldn't sleep a wink if I thought that such a great artist was obliged to spend the night in a stuffy carriage with three other people.”

Julia continued to protest, but not too much. It was terribly sweet of him. She didn't know how to thank him. He would not even let her pay for the sleeper. He begged her, almost with tears in his eyes, to let him have the great privilege of making her that trifling present. She had with her only a dressing-bag, in which were her face creams, her night-dress and her toilet things, and this he put on the table for her. All he asked was that he might be allowed to sit with her and smoke a cigarette or two till she wanted to go to bed. She could hardly refuse him that. The bed was already made up and they sat down on it. In a few minutes the conductor came back with a bottle of champagne and a couple of glasses. It was an odd little adventure and Julia was enjoying it. It was wonderfully polite of him, all that, ah, those foreigners, they knew how to treat a great actress. Of course that was the sort of thing that happened to Bernhardt every day. And Siddons, when she went into a drawing-room everyone stood up as though she were royalty. He complimented her on her beautiful French. Born in Jersey and educated in France? Ah, that explained it. But why hadn't she chosen to act in French rather than in English? She would have as great a reputation as Duse if she had. She reminded him of Duse, the same magnificent eyes and the pale skin, and in her acting the same emotion and the wonderful naturalness.

They half finished the bottle of champagne and Julia realized that it was very late.

“I really think I ought to go to bed now.”

“I'll leave you.”

He got up and kissed her hand. When he was gone Julia bolted the door and undressed. Putting out all the lights except the one just behind her head she began to read. Presently there was a knock at the door.

“Yes?”

“I'm sorry to disturb you. I left my toothbrush in the lavabo. May I get it?”

“I'm in bed.”

“I can't go to sleep unless I brush my teeth.”

“Oh, well, he's clean anyway.”

With a little shrug of her shoulders Julia slipped her hand to the door and drew back the bolt. It would be stupid in the circumstances to be prudish. He came in, went into the lavatory and in a moment came out, brandishing a toothbrush. She had noticed it when she brushed her own teeth, but thought it belonged to the person who had the compartment next door. At that period adjoining compartments shared a lavatory. The Spaniard seemed to catch sight of the bottle.

“I'm so thirsty, do you mind if I have a glass of champagne?”

Julia was silent for a fraction of a second. It was his champagne and his compartment. Oh, well, in for a penny, in for a pound.

“Of course not.”

He poured himself out a glass, lit a cigarette and sat down on the edge of her bed. She moved a little to give him more room. He accepted the situation as perfectly natural.

“You couldn't possibly have slept in that carriage,” he said. “There's a man there who's a heavy breather. I'd almost rather he snored. If he snored one could wake him.”

“I'm so sorry.”

“Oh, it doesn't matter. If the worst comes to the worst I'll curl up in the corridor outside your door.”

“He can hardly expect me to ask him to come and sleep in here,” Julia said to herself. “I'm beginning to think this was all a put-up job. Nothing doing, my lad.” And then aloud: “Romantic, of course, but uncomfortable.”

“You're a terribly attractive woman.”

She was just as glad that her night-dress was pretty and that she had put no cream on her face. She had in point of fact not troubled to take off her make-up. Her lips were brightly scarlet, and with the reading light behind her she well knew that she did not look her worst. But she answered ironically.

“If you think that because you've given up your compartment to me I'm going to let you sleep with me, you're mistaken.”

“Just as you say, of course. But why not?”

“I'm not that sort of terribly attractive woman.”

“What sort of woman are you then?”

“A faithful wife and a devoted mother.”

He gave a little sigh.

“Very well. Then I'll say good-night to you.”

He crushed the stub of his cigarette on the ash tray and took her hand and kissed it. He slowly ran his lips up her arm. It gave Julia a funny little sensation.The beard slightly tickled her skin. Then he leant over and kissed her lips. His beard had a somewhat musty smell, which she found peculiar; she was not sure if it revolted or thrilled her. It was odd when she came to think of it, she had never been kissed by a man with a beard before. It seemed strangely indecent. He snapped out the light.

He did not leave her till a chink of light through the drawn blind warned them that day had broken. Julia was shattered morally and physically.

“I shall look a perfect wreck when we get to Cannes.”

And what a risk to take! He might have murdered her or stolen her pearl necklace. She went hot and cold all over as she pictured to herself the danger she had incurred. He was going to Cannes too. Supposing he claimed acquaintance with her there, how on earth was she going to explain him to her friends? She felt sure Dolly wouldn't like him. He might try to blackmail her. And what should she do if he wanted to repeat the experience? He was passionate, there was no doubt about that, he had asked her where she was staying, and though she had not told him, he could certainly find out if he tried; in a place like Cannes, it would be almost impossible not to run across him. He might pester her. If he loved her as much as he said it was inconceivable that he should let her alone, and foreigners were so unreliable, he might make frightful scenes. The only comfort was that he was only staying over Easter, she would pretend she was tired and tell Dolly that she preferred to stay quietly at the villa.

“How could I have been such a fool?” she cried angrily.

Dolly would be there to meet her at the station, and if he was tactless enough to come up and say good-bye to her she would tell Dolly that he had given up his compartment to her. There was no harm in that. It was always best to tell as much of the truth as you could. But there was quite a crowd of passengers getting out at Cannes, and Julia got out of the station and into Dolly's car without catching a glimpse of him.

“I've arranged nothing for today,” said Dolly. “I thought you'd be tired and I wanted to have you all to myself just for twenty-four hours.”

Julia gave her arm an affectionate squeeze.

“That'll be too wonderful. We'll just sit about the villa and grease our faces and have a good old gossip.”

But next day Dolly had arranged that they should go out to lunch, and they were to meet their hosts at one of the bars on the Croisette to have cocktails. It was a beautiful day, clear, warm and sunny. When they got out of the car Dolly stopped to give the chauffeur instructions about fetching them and Julia waited for her. Suddenly her heart gave a great jump, for there was the Spaniard walking towards her, with a woman on one side of him clinging to his arm and on the other a little girl whose hand he held. She had not time to turn away. At that moment Dolly joined her to walk across the pavement. The Spaniard came, gave her a glance in which there was no sign of recognition, he was in animated conversation with the woman on his arm, and walked on. In a flash Julia understood that he was just as little anxious to see her as she was to see him. The woman and the child were obviously his wife and daughter whom he had come down to Cannes to spend Easter with. What a relief! Now she could enjoy herself without fear. But as she accompanied Dolly to the bar, Julia thought how disgusting men were. You simply couldn't trust them for a minute. It was really disgraceful that a man with a charming wife and such a sweet little girl should be willing to pick up a woman in the train. You would think they'd have some sense of decency.

But as time passed Julia's indignation was mitigated and she had often thought of the adventure since with a good deal of pleasure. After all it had been fun. Sometimes she allowed her reveries to run away with her and she went over in her fancy the incidents of that singular night. He had been a most agreeable lover. It would be something to look back on when she was an old woman. It was the beard that had made such an impression on her, the odd feeling of it on her face and that slightly musty smell which was repulsive and yet strangely exciting. For years she looked out for men with beards, and she had a feeling that if one of them made proposals to her she simply wouldn't be able to resist him. But few men wore beards any more, luckily for her because the sight made her go a little weak at the knees, and none of those that did ever made any advance to her. She would have liked to know who the Spaniard was. She saw him a day or two later playing chemin de fer at the Casino and asked two or three people if they knew him. Nobody did, and he remained in her recollection, and in her bones, without a name. It was an odd coincidence that she didn't know the name either of the young man who had that afternoon behaved in so unexpected a manner. It struck her as rather comic.

“If I only knew beforehand that they were going to take liberties with me I'd at least ask for their cards.”

With this thought she fell happily asleep.





Chapter 13


Some days passed, and one morning, while Julia was lying in bed reading a play, they rang through from the basement to ask if she would speak to Mr. Fennell. The name meant nothing to her and she was about to refuse when it occurred to her that it might be the young man of her adventure. Her curiosity induced her to tell them to connect him. She recognized his voice.

“You promised to ring me up,” he said. “I got tired of waiting, so I've rung you up instead.”

“I've been terribly busy the last few days.”

“When am I going to see you?”

“As soon as I have a moment to spare.”

“What about this afternoon?”

“I've got a matinée today.”

“Come to tea after the matinée.”

She smiled. (“No, young feller-me-lad, you don't catch me a second time like that.”)

“I can't possibly,” she answered. “I always stay in my dressing-room and rest till the evening performance.”

“Can't I come and see you while you're resting?”

She hesitated for an instant. Perhaps the best thing would be to let him come; with Evie popping in and out and Miss Phillips due at seven, there would be no chance of any nonsense, and it would be a good opportunity to tell him, amiably, because he was really a sweet little thing, but firmly, that the incident of the other afternoon was to have no sequel. With a few well-chosen words she would explain to him that it was quite unreasonable and that he must oblige her by erasing the episode from his memory.

“All right. Come at half-past five and I'll give you a cup of tea.”

There was no part of her busy life that she enjoyed more than those three hours that she spent in her dressing-room between the afternoon and the evening performances. The other members of the cast had gone away; and Evie was there to attend to her wants and the door-keeper to guard her privacy. Her dressing-room was like the cabin of a ship. The world seemed a long way off, and she relished her seclusion. She felt an enchanting freedom. She dozed a little, she read a little, or lying on the comfortable sofa she let her thoughts wander. She reflected on the part she was playing and the favourite parts she had played in the past. She thought of Roger her son. Pleasant reveries sauntered through her mind like lovers wandering in a green wood. She was fond of French poetry, and sometimes she repeated to herself verses of Verlaine.

Punctually at half-past five Evie brought her in a card. “Mr. Thomas Fennell,” she read.

“Send him in and bring some tea.”

She had decided how she was going to treat him. She would be amiable, but distant. She would take a friendly interest in his work and ask him about his examination. Then she would talk to him about Roger. Roger was seventeen now and in a year would be going to Cambridge. She would insinuate the fact that she was old enough to be his mother. She would act as if there had never been anything between them and he would go away, never to see her again except across the footlights, half convinced that the whole thing had been a figment of his fancy. But when she saw him, so slight, with his hectic flush and his blue eyes, so charmingly boyish, she felt a sudden pang. Evie closed the door behind him. She was lying on the sofa and she stretched out her arm to give him her hand, the gracious smile of Madame Récamier on her lips, but he flung himself on his knees and passionately kissed her mouth. She could not help herself, she put her arms round his neck, and kissed him as passionately.

(“Oh, my good resolutions. My God, I can't have fallen in love with him.”)

“For goodness' sake, sit down. Evie's coming in with the tea.”

“Tell her not to disturb us.”

“What do you mean?” But what he meant was obvious. Her heart began to beat quickly. “It's ridiculous. I can't. Michael might come in.”

“I want you.”

“What d'you suppose Evie would think? It'd be idiotic to take such a risk. No, no, no.”

There was a knock at the door and Evie came in with the tea. Julia gave her instructions to put the table by the side of her sofa and a chair for the young man on the other side of the table. She kept Evie with unnecessary conversation. She felt him looking at her. His eyes moved quickly, following her gestures and the expression of her face; she avoided them, but she felt their anxiety and the eagerness of his desire. She was troubled. It seemed to her that her voice did not sound quite natural.

(“What the devil's the matter with me? God, I can hardly breathe.”)

When Evie reached the door the boy made a gesture that was so instinctive that her sensitiveness rather than her sight caught it. She could not but look at him. His face had gone quite pale.

“Oh, Evie,” she said. “This gentleman wants to talk to me about a play. See that no one disturbs me. I'll ring when I want you.”

“Very good, miss.”

Evie went out and closed the door.

(“I'm a fool. I'm a bloody fool.”)

But he had moved the table, and he was on his knees, and she was in his arms.

She sent him away a little before Miss Phillips was due, and when he was going rang for Evie.

“Play any good?” asked Evie.

“What play?”

“The play 'e was talkin' to you about.”

“He's clever. Of course he's young.”

Evie was looking down at the dressing-table. Julia liked everything always to be in the same place, and if a pot of grease or her eyeblack was not exactly where it should be made a scene.

“Where's your comb?”

He had used it to comb his hair and had carelessly placed it on the tea-table. When Evie caught sight of it she stared at it for a moment reflectively.

“How on earth did it get there?” cried Julia lightly.

“I was just wondering.”

It gave Julia a nasty turn. Of course it was madness to do that sort of thing in the dressing-room. Why, there wasn't even a key in the lock. Evie kept it. All the same the risk had given it a spice. It was fun to think that she could be so crazy. At all events they'd made a date now. Tom, she'd asked him what they called him at home and he said Thomas, she really couldn't call him that. Tom wanted to take her to supper somewhere so that they could dance, and it happened that Michael was going up to Cambridge for a night to rehearse a series of one-act plays written by undergraduates. They would be able to spend hours together.

“You can get back with the milk,” he'd said.

“And what about my performance next day?”

“We can't bother about that.”

She had refused to let him fetch her at the theatre, and when she got to the restaurant they had chosen he was waiting for her in the lobby. His face lit up as he saw her.

“It was getting so late, I was afraid you weren't coming.”

“I'm sorry, some tiresome people came round after the play and I couldn't get rid of them.”

But it wasn't true. She had been as excited all the evening as a girl going to her first ball. She could not help thinking how absurd she was. But when she had taken off her theatrical make-up and made up again for supper she could not satisfy herself. She put blue on her eyelids and took it off again, she rouged her cheeks, rubbed them clean and tried another colour.

“What are you trying to do?” said Evie.

“I'm trying to look twenty, you fool.”

“If you try much longer you'll look your age.”

She had never seen him in evening clothes before. He shone like a new pin. Though he was of no more than average height his slimness made him look tall. She was a trifle touched to see that for all his airs of the man of the world he was shy with the head-waiter when it came to ordering supper. They danced and he did not dance very well, but she found his slight awkwardness rather charming. People recognized her, and she was conscious that he enjoyed the reflected glory of their glances. A pair of young things who had been dancing came up to their table to say how-do-you-do-to her. When they had left he asked:

“Wasn't that Lord and Lady Dennorant?”

“Yes. I've known George since he was at Eton.”

He followed them with his eyes.

“She was Lady Cecily Laweston, wasn't she?”

“I've forgotten. Was she?”

It seemed a matter of no interest to her. A few minutes later another couple passed them.

“Look, there's Lady Lepard.”

“Who's she?”

“Don't you remember, they had a big party at their place in Cheshire a few weeks ago and the Prince of Wales was there. It was in the Bystander.”

Oh, that was how he got all his information. Poor sweet. He read about grand people in the papers and now and then, at a restaurant or a theatre, saw them in the flesh. Of course it was a thrill for him. Romance. If he only knew how dull they were really! This innocent passion for the persons whose photographs appear in the illustrated papers made him seem incredibly naïve, and she looked at him with tender eyes.

“Have you ever taken an actress out to supper before?”

He blushed scarlet.

“Never.”

She hated to let him pay the bill, she had an inkling that it was costing pretty well his week's salary, but she knew it would hurt his pride if she offered to pay it herself. She asked casually what the time was and instinctively he looked at his wrist.

“I forgot to put on my watch.”

She gave him a searching look.

“Have you pawned it?”

He reddened again.

“No. I dressed in rather a hurry tonight.”

She only had to look at his tie to know that he had done no such thing. He was lying to her. She knew that he had pawned his watch in order to take her out to supper. A lump came into her throat. She could have taken him in her arms then and there and kissed his blue eyes. She adored him.

“Let's go,” she said.

They drove back to his bed-sitting room in Tavistock Square.





Chapter 14


Next day Julia went to Cartier's and bought a watch to send to Tom Fennell instead of the one he had pawned, and two or three weeks later, discovering that it was his birthday, she sent him a gold cigarette-case.

“D'you know, that's the one thing I've wanted all my life.”

She wondered if there were tears in his eyes. He kissed her passionately.

Then, on one excuse and another, she sent him pearl studs and sleeve-links and waistcoat buttons. It thrilled her to make him presents.

“It's so awful that I can't give you anything in return,” he said.

“Give me the watch you pawned to stand me a supper.”

It was a little gold watch that could not have cost more than ten pounds, but it amused her to wear it now and then.

It was not till after that night when they had first supped together that Julia confessed to herself that she had fallen in love with Tom. It came to her as a shock. But she was exhilarated.

“I who thought I could never be in love again. Of course it can't last. But why shouldn't I get what fun out of it I can?”

She decided that he must come again to Stanhope Place. It was not long before an opportunity presented itself.

“You know that young accountant of yours,” she said to Michael. “Tom Fennell's his name. I met him out at supper the other night and I'ved asked him to dinner next Sunday. We want an extra man.”

“Oh, d'you think he'll fit in?”

It was rather a grand party. It was on that account she had asked him. She thought it would please him to meet some of the people he had known only from their pictures. She had realized already that he was a bit of a snob. Well, that was all to the good; she could give him all the smart people he wanted. For Julia was shrewd, and she knew very well that Tom was not in love with her. To have an affair with her flattered his vanity. He was a highly-sexed young man and enjoyed sexual exercise. From hints, from stories that she had dragged out of him, she discovered that since he was seventeen he had had a great many women. He loved the act rather than the person. He looked upon it as the greatest lark in the world. And she could understand why he had so much success. There was something appealing in his slightness, his body was just skin and bone, that was why his clothes sat on him so well, and something charming in his clean freshness. His shyness and his effrontery combined to make him irresistible. It was strangely flattering for a woman to be treated as a little bit of fluff that you just tumbled on to a bed.

“What he's got, of course, is sex appeal.”

She knew that his good looks were due to his youth. He would grow wizened as he grew older, dried up and haggard; that charming flush on his cheeks would turn into a purple glow and his delicate skin would go lined and sallow; but the feeling that what she loved in him would endure so short a time increased her tenderness. She felt a strange compassion for him. He had the high spirits of youth, and she lapped them up as a kitten laps up milk. But he was not amusing. Though he laughed when Julia said a funny thing he never said one himself. She did not mind. She found his dullness restful. She never felt so light-hearted as in his company, and she could be brilliant enough for two.

People kept on telling Julia that she was looking ten years younger and that she had never acted better. She knew it was true and she knew the reason. But it behoved her to walk warily. She must keep her head. Charles Tamerley always said that what an actress needed was not intelligence, but sensibility, and he might be right; perhaps she wasn't clever, but her feelings were alert and she trusted them. They told her now that she must never tell Tom that she loved him.

She was careful to make it plain to him that she laid no claims on him and that he was free to do whatever he liked. She took up the attitude that the whole thing was a bit of nonsense to which neither of them must attach importance. But she left nothing undone to bind him to her. He liked parties and she took him to parties. She got Dolly and Charles Tamerley to ask him to lunch. He was fond of dancing and she got him cards for balls. For his sake she would go to them herself for an hour, and she was conscious of the satisfaction he got out of seeing how much fuss people made of her. She knew that he was dazzled by the great, and she introduced him to eminent persons. Fortunately Michael took a fancy to him. Michael liked to talk, and Tom was a good listener. He was clever at his business. One day Michael said to her:

“Smart fellow, Tom. He knows a lot about income tax. I believe he's shown me a way of saving two or three hundred pounds on my next return.”

Michael, looking for new talent, often took him to the play in the evenings, either in London or the suburbs; they would fetch Julia after the performance, and the three of them supped together. Now and then Michael asked Tom to play golf with him on Sundays and then if there was no party would bring him home to dinner.

“Nice to have a young fellow like that around,” he said. “It keeps one from growing rusty.”

Tom was very pleasant about the house. He would play backgammon with Michael, or patience with Julia, and when they turned on the gramophone he was always there to change the records.

“He'll be a nice friend for Roger,” said Michael. “Tom's got his head screwed on his shoulders the right way, and he's a lot older than Roger. He ought to have a good influence on him. Why don't you ask him to come and spend his holiday with us?”

(“Lucky I'm a good actress.”) But it wanted an effort to keep the joy out of her voice and to prevent her face from showing the exultation that made her heart beat so violently. “That's not a bad idea,” she answered. “I'll ask him if you like.”

Their play was running through August, and Michael had taken a house at Taplow so that they could spend the height of the summer there. Julia was to come up for her performances and Michael when business needed it, but she would have the day in the country and Sundays. Tom had a fortnight's holiday; he accepted the invitation with alacrity.

But one day Julia noticed that he was unusually silent. He looked pale and his buoyant spirits had deserted him. She knew that something was wrong, but he would not tell her what it was; he would only say that he was worried to death. At last she forced him to confess that he had got into debt and was being dunned by tradesmen. The life into which she had led him had made him spend more money than he could afford, and ashamed of his cheap clothes at the grand parties to which she took him, he had gone to an expensive tailor and ordered himself new suits. He had backed a horse hoping to make enough money to get square and the horse was beaten. To Julia it was a very small sum that he owed, a hundred and twenty-five pounds, and she found it absurd that anyone should allow a trifle like that to upset him. She said at once that she would give it to him.

“Oh, I couldn't. I couldn't take money from a woman.”

He went scarlet; the mere thought of it made him ashamed. Julia used all her arts of cajolery. She reasoned, she pretended to be affronted, she even cried a little, and at last as a great favour he consented to borrow the money from her. Next day she sent him a letter in which were bank notes to the value of two hundred pounds. He rang her up and told her that she had sent far more than he wanted.

“Oh, I know people always lie about their debts,” she said with a laugh. “I'm sure you owe more than you said.”

“I promise you I don't. You're the last person I'd lie to.”

“Then keep the rest for anything that turns up. I hate seeing you pay the bill when we go out to supper. And taxis and all that sort of thing.”

“No, really. It's so humiliating.”

“What nonsense! You know I've got more money than I know what do do with. Can you grudge me the happiness it gives me to get you out of a hole?”

“It's awfully kind of you. You don't know what a relief it is. I don't know how to thank you.”

But his voice was troubled. Poor lamb, he was so conventional. But it was true, it gave her a thrill she had never known before to give him money; it excited in her a surprising passion. And she had another scheme in her head which during the fortnight Tom was to spend at Taplow she thought she could easily work. Tom's bedsitting-room in Tavistock Square had at first seemed to her charming in its sordidness, and the humble furniture had touched her heart. But time had robbed it of these moving characteristics. Once or twice she had met people on the stairs and thought they stared at her strangely. There was a slatternly housekeeper who made Tom's room and cooked his breakfast, and Julia had a feeling that she knew what was going on and was spying on her. Once the locked door had been tried while Julia was in the room, and when she went out the housekeeper was dusting the banisters. She gave Julia a sour look. Julia hated the smell of stale food that hung about the stairs and with her quick eyes she soon discovered that Tom's room was none too clean. The dingy curtains, the worn carpet, the shoddy furniture; it all rather disgusted her. Now it happened that a little while before, Michael, always on the look out for a good investment, had bought a block of garages near Stanhope Place. By letting off those he did not want he found that he could get their own for nothing. There were a number of rooms over. He divided them into two small flats, one for their chauffeur and one which he proposed to let. This was still vacant and Julia suggested to Tom that he should take it. It would be wonderful. She could slip along and see him for an hour when he got back from the office; sometimes she could drop in after the theatre and no one would be any the wiser. They would be free there. She talked to him of the fun they would have furnishing it; she was sure they had lots of things in their house that they did not want, and by storing them he would be doing them a kindness. The rest they would buy together. He was tempted by the idea of having a flat of his own, but it was out of the question; the rent, though small, was beyond his means. Julia knew that. She knew also that if she offered to pay it herself he would indignantly refuse. But she had a notion that during that idle, luxurious fortnight by the river she would be able to overcome his scruples. She saw how much the idea tempted him, and she had little doubt that she could devise some means to persuade him that by falling in with her proposal he was really doing her a service.

“People don't want reasons to do what they'd like to,” she reflected. “They want excuses.”

Julia looked forward to Tom's visit to Taplow with excitement. It would be lovely to go on the river with him in the morning and in the afternoon sit about the garden with him. With Roger in the house she was determined that there should be no nonsense between her and Tom; decency forbad. But it would be heaven to spend nearly all day with him. When she had matinées he could amuse himself with Roger.

But things did not turn out at all as she expected. It had never occurred to her that Roger and Tom would take a great fancy to one another. There were five years between them and she thought, or would have if she had thought about it at all, that Tom would look upon Roger as a hobbledehoy, quite nice of course, but whom you treated as such, who fetched and carried for you and whom you told to go and play when you did not want to be bothered with him. Roger was seventeen. He was a nice-looking boy, with reddish hair and blue eyes, but that was the best you could say of him. He had neither his mother's vivacity and changing expression nor his father's beauty of feature. Julia was somewhat disappointed in him. As a child when she had been so constantly photographed with him he was lovely. He was rather stolid now and he had a serious look. Really when you came to examine him his only good features were his teeth and his hair. Julia was very fond of him, but she could not but find him a trifle dull. When she was alone with him the time hung somewhat heavily on her hands. She exhibited a lively interest in the things she supposed must interest him, cricket and such like, but he did not seem to have much to say about them. She was afraid he was not very intelligent.

“Of course he's young,” she said hopefully. “Perhaps he'll improve as he grows older.”

From the time that he first went to his preparatory school she had seen little of him. During the holidays she was always acting at night and he went out with his father or with a boy friend, and on Sundays he and his father played golf together. If she happened to be lunching out it often happened that she did not see him for two or three days together except for a few minutes in the morning when he came to her room. It was a pity he could not always have remained a sweetly pretty little boy who could play in her room without disturbing her and be photographed, smiling into the camera, with his arm round her neck. She went down to see him at Eton occasionally and had tea with him. It flattered her that there were several photographs of her in his room. She was conscious that when she went to Eton it created quite a little excitement, and Mr. Brackenbridge, in whose house he was, made a point of being very polite to her. When the half ended Michael and Julia had already moved to Taplow and Roger came straight there. Julia kissed him emotionally. He was not so much excited at getting home as she had expected him to be. He was rather casual. He seemed suddenly to have grown very sophisticated.

He told Julia at once that he desired to leave Eton at Christmas, he thought he had got everything out of it that he could, and he wanted to go to Vienna for a few months and learn German before going up to Cambridge. Michael had wished him to go into the army, but this he had set his face against. He did not yet know what he wanted to be. Both Julia and Michael had from the first been obsessed by the fear that he would go on the stage, but for this apparently he had no inclination.

“Anyhow he wouldn't be any good,” said Julia.

He led his own life. He went out on the river and lay about the garden reading. On his seventeenth birthday Julia had given him a very smart roadster, and in this he careered about the country at breakneck speeds.

“There's one comfort,” said Julia. “He's no bother. He seems quite capable of amusing himself.”

On Sundays they had a good many people down for the day, actors and actresses, an occasional writer, and a sprinkling of some of their grander friends. Julia found these parties very amusing and she knew that people liked to come to them. On the first Sunday after Roger's arrival there was a great mob. Roger was very polite to the guests. He did his duty as part host like a man of the world. But it seemed to Julia that he held himself in some curious way aloof, as though he were playing a part in which he had not lost himself, and she had an uneasy feeling that he was not accepting all these people, but coolly judging them. She had an impression that he took none of them very seriously.

Tom had arranged to come on the following Saturday and she drove him down after the theatre. It was a moonlit night and at that hour the roads were empty. The drive was enchanting. Julia would have liked it to go on for ever. She nestled against him and every now and then in the darkness he kissed her.

“Are you happy?” she asked.

“Absolutely.”

Michael and Roger had gone to bed, but supper was waiting for them in the dining-room. The silent house gave them the feeling of being there without leave. They might have been a couple of wanderers who had strolled out of the night into a strange house and found a copious repast laid out for them. It was romantic. It had a little the air of a tale in the Arabian Nights. Julia showed him his room, which was next door to Roger's, and then went to bed. She did not wake till late next morning. It was a lovely day. So that she might have Tom all to herself she had not asked anybody down. When she was dressed they would go on the river together. She had her breakfast and her bath. She put on a little white frock that suited the sunny riverside and her, and a large-brimmed red straw hat whose colour threw a warm glow on her face. She was very little made up. She looked at herself in the glass and smiled with satisfaction. She really looked very pretty and young. She strolled down into the garden. There was a lawn that stretched down to the river, and here she saw Michael surrounded by the Sunday papers. He was alone.

“I thought you'd gone to play golf.”

“No, the boys have gone. I thought they'd have more fun if I let them go alone.” He smiled in his friendly way. “They're a bit too active for me. They were bathing at eight o'clock this morning, and as soon as they'd swallowed their breakfast they bolted off in Roger's car.”

“I'm glad they've made friends.”

Julia meant it. She was slightly disappointed that she would not be able to go on the river with Tom, but she was anxious that Roger should like him, she had a feeling that Roger did not like people indiscriminately; and after all she had the next fortnight to be with Tom.

“They make me feel damned middle-aged, I don't mind telling you that,” Michael remarked.

“What nonsense. You're much more beautiful than either of them, and well you know it, my pet.”

Michael thrust out his jaw a little and pulled in his belly.

The boys did not come back till lunch was nearly ready.

“Sorry we're so late,” said Roger. “There was a filthy crowd and we had to wait on nearly every tee. We halved the match.”

They were hungry and thirsty, excited and pleased with themselves.

“It's grand having no one here today,” said Roger. “I was afraid you'd got a whole gang coming and we'd have to behave like little gentlemen.”

“I thought a rest would be rather nice,” said Julia.

Roger gave her a glance.

“It'll do you good, Mummy. You're looking awfully fagged.”

(“Blast his eyes. No, I mustn't show I mind. Thank God, I can act.”)

She laughed gaily.

“I had a sleepless night wondering what on earth we were going to do about your spots.”

“I know, aren't they sickening? Tom says he used to have them too.”

Julia looked at Tom. In his tennis shirt open at the neck, with his hair ruffled, his face already caught by the sun, he looked incredibly young. He really looked no older than Roger.

“Anyhow, his nose is going to peel,” Roger went on with a chuckle. “He'll look a sight then.”

Julia felt slightly uneasy. It seemed to her that Tom had shed the years so that he was become not only in age Roger's contemporary. They talked a great deal of nonsense. They ate enormously and drank tankards of beer. Michael, eating and drinking as sparingly as usual, watched them with amusement. He was enjoying their youth and their high spirits. He reminded Julia of an old dog lying in the sun and gently beating his tail on the ground as he looked at a pair of puppies gambolling about him. They had coffee on the lawn. Julia found it very pleasant to sit there in the shade, looking at the river. Tom was slim and graceful in his long white trousers. She had never seen him smoke a pipe before. She found it strangely touching. But Roger mocked him.

“Do you smoke it because it makes you feel manly or because you like it?”

“Shut up,” said Tom.

“Finished your coffee?”

“Yes.”

“Come on then, let's go on the river.”

Tom gave her a doubtful look. Roger saw it.

“Oh, it's all right, you needn't bother about my respected parents, they've got the Sunday papers. Mummy's just given me a racing punt.”

(“I must keep my temper. I must keep my temper. Why was I such a fool as to give him a racing punt?”)

“All right,” she said, with an indulgent smile, “go on the river, but don't fall in.”

“It won't hurt us if we do. We'll be back for tea. Is the court marked out, Daddy? We're going to play tennis after tea.”

“I daresay your father can get hold of somebody and you can have a four.”

“Oh, don't bother. Singles are better fun really and one gets more exercise.” Then to Tom: “I'll race you to the boathouse.”

Tom leapt to his feet and dashed off with Roger in quick pursuit. Michael took up one of the papers and looked for his spectacles.

“They've clicked all right, haven't they?”

“Apparently.”

“I was afraid Roger would be rather bored alone here with us. It'll be fine for him to have someone to play around with.”

“Don't you think Roger's rather inconsiderate?”

“You mean about the tennis? Oh, my dear, I don't really care if I play or not. It's only natural that those two boys should want to play together. From their point of view I'm an old man, and they think I'll spoil their game. After all the great thing is that they should have a good time.”

Julia had a pang of remorse. Michael was prosy, near with his money, self-complacent, but how extraordinarily kind he was and how unselfish! He was devoid of envy. It gave him a real satisfaction, so long as it did not cost money, to make other people happy. She read his mind like an open book. It was true that he never had any but a commonplace thought; on the other hand he never had a shameful one. It was exasperating that with so much to make him worthy of her affection, she should be so excruciatingly bored by him.

“I think you're a much better man that I am a woman, my sweet,” she said.

He gave her his good, friendly smile and slightly shook his head.

“No, dear, I had a wonderful profile, but you've got genius.”

Julia giggled. There was a certain fun to be got out of a man who never knew what you were talking about. But what did they mean when they said an actress had genius? Julia had often asked herself what it was that had placed her at last head and shoulders above her contemporaries. She had had detractors. At one time people had compared her unfavourably with some actress or other who at the moment enjoyed the public favour, but now no one disputed her supremacy. It was true that she had not the world-wide notoriety of the film-stars; she had tried her luck on the pictures, but had achieved no success; her face on the stage so mobile and expressive for some reason lost on the screen, and after one trial she had with Michael's approval refused to accept any of the offers that were from time to time made her. She had got a good deal of useful publicity out of her dignified attitude. But Julia did not envy the film-stars; they came and went; she stayed. When it was possible she went to see the performance of actresses who played leading parts on the London stage. She was generous in her praise of them and her praise was sincere. Sometimes she honestly thought them so very good that she could not understand why people made so much fuss over her. She was much too intelligent not to know in what estimation the public held her, but she was modest about herself. It always surprised her when people raved over something she had done that came to her so naturally that she had never thought it possible to do anything else. The critics admired her variety. They praised especially her capacity for insinuating herself into a part. She was not aware that she deliberately observed people, but when she came to study a new part vague recollections surged up in her from she knew not where, and she found that she knew things about the character she was to represent that she had had no inkling of. It helped her to think of someone she knew or even someone she had seen in the street or at a party; she combined with this recollection her own personality, and thus built up a character founded on fact but enriched with her experience, her knowledge of technique and her amazing magnetism. People thought that she only acted during the two or three hours she was on the stage; they did not know that the character she was playing dwelt in the back of her mind all day long, when she was talking to others with all the appearance of attention, or in whatever business she was engaged. It often seemed to her that she was two persons, the actress, the popular favourite, the best-dressed woman in London, and that was a shadow; and the woman she was playing at night, and that was the substance.

“Damned if I know what genius is,” she said to herself. “But I know this, I'd give all I have to be eighteen.”

But she knew that wasn't true. If she were given the chance to go back again would she take it? No. Not really. It was not the popularity, the celebrity if you like, that she cared for, nor the hold she had over audiences, the real love they bore her, it was certainly not the money this had brought her; it was the power she felt in herself, her mastery over the medium, that thrilled her. She could step into a part, not a very good one perhaps, with silly words to say, and by her personality, by the dexterity which she had at her finger tips, infuse it with life. There was no one who could do what she could with a part. Sometimes she felt like God.

“And besides,” she chuckled, “Tom wouldn't be born.”

After all it was very natural that he should like to play about with Roger. They belonged to the same generation. It was the first day of his holiday, she must let him enjoy himself; there was a whole fortnight more. He would soon get sick of being all the time with a boy of seventeen. Roger was sweet, but he was dull; she wasn't going to let maternal affection blind her to that. She must be very careful not to show that she was in the least put out. From the beginning she had made up her mind that she would never make any claim on Tom; it would be fatal if he felt that he owed something to her.

“Michael, why don't you let that flat in the mews to Tom? Now that he's passed his exam and is a chartered accountant he can't go on living in a bed-sitting-room.”

“That's not a bad idea. I'll suggest it to him.”

“It would save an agent's fees. We could help him to furnish it. We've got a lot of stuff stored away. We might just as well let him use it as have it moulder away in the attics.”

Tom and Roger came back to eat an enormous tea and then played tennis till the light failed. After dinner they played dominoes. Julia gave a beautiful performance of a still-young mother fondly watching her son and his boy friend. She went to bed early. Presently they too went upstairs. Their rooms were just over hers. She heard Roger go into Tom's room. They began talking, her windows and theirs were open, and she heard their voices in animated conversation. She wondered with exasperation what they found to say to one another. She had never found either of them very talkative. After a while Michael's voice interrupted them.

“Now then, you kids, you go to bed. You can go on talking tomorrow.”

She heard them laugh.

“All right, Daddy,” cried Roger.

“A pair of damned chatterboxes, that's what you are.”

She heard Roger's voice again.

“Well, good-night, old boy.”

And Tom's hearty answer: “So long, old man.”

“Idiots!” she said to herself crossly.

Next morning while she was having her breakfast Michael came into Julia's room.

“The boys have gone off to play golf at Huntercombe. They want to play a couple of rounds and they asked if they need come back to lunch. I told them that was quite all right.”

“I don't know that I particularly like the idea of Tom treating the house as if it was a hotel.”

“Oh, my dear, they're only a couple of kids. Let them have all the fun they can get, I say.”

She would not see Tom at all that day, for she had to start for London between five and six in order to get to the theatre in good time. It was all very well for Michael to be so damned good-natured about it. She was hurt. She felt a little inclined to cry. He must be entirely indifferent to her, it was Tom she was thinking of now; and she had made up her mind that today was going to be quite different from the day before. She had awakened determined to be tolerant and to take things as they came, but she hadn't been prepared for a smack in the face like this.

“Have the papers come yet?” she asked sulkily.

She drove up to town with rage in her heart.

The following day was not much better. The boys did not go off to play golf, but they played tennis. Their incessant activity profoundly irritated Julia. Tom in shorts, with his bare legs, and a cricket shirt, really did not look more than sixteen. Bathing as they did three or four times a day he could not get his hair to stay down, and the moment it was dry it spread over his head in unruly curls. It made him look younger than ever, but oh, so charming. Julia's heart was wrung. And it seemed to her that his demeanour had strangely changed; in the constant companionship of Roger he had shed the young man about town who was so careful of his dress, so particular about wearing the right thing, and was become again a sloppy little schoolboy. He never gave a hint, no glance even betrayed, that he was her lover; he treated her as if she were no more than Roger's mother. In every remark he made, in his mischievousness, in his polite little ways, he made her feel that she belonged to an older generation. His behaviour had nothing of the chivalrous courtesy a young man might show to a fascinating woman; it was the tolerant kindness he might display to a maiden aunt.

Julia was irritated that Tom should docilely follow the lead of a boy so much younger than himself. It indicated lack of character. But she did not blame him; she blamed Roger. Roger's selfishness revolted her. It was all very well to say he was young. His indifference to anyone's pleasure but his own showed a vile disposition. He was tactless and inconsiderate. He acted as though the house, the servants, his father and mother were there for his particular convenience. She would often have been rather sharp with him, but that she did not dare before Tom assume the role of the correcting mother. And when you reproved Rogerhe had a maddening way of looking deeply hurt, like a stricken hind, which made you feel that you had been unkind and unjust. She could look like that too, it was an expression of the eyes that he had inherited from her; she had used it over and over again on the stage with moving effect, and she knew it need not mean very much, but when she saw it in his it shattered her. The mere thought of it now made her feel tenderly towards him. And that sudden change of feeling showed her the truth; she was jealous of Roger, madly jealous. The realization gave her something of a shock; she did not know whether to laugh or to be ashamed. She reflected a moment.

“Well, I'll cook his goose all right.”

She was not going to let the following Sunday pass like the last. Thank God, Tom was a snob. “A woman attracts men by her charm and holds them by their vices,” she murmured and wondered whether she had invented the aphorism or remembered it from some play she had once acted in.

She gave instructions for some telephoning to be done. She got the Dennorants to come for the weekend. Charles Tamerley was staying at Henley and accepted an invitation to come over for Sunday and bring his host, Sir Mayhew Bryanston, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer. To amuse him and the Dennorants, because she knew that the upper classes do not want to meet one another in what they think is Bohemia, but artists of one sort or another, she asked Archie Dexter, her leading man, and his pretty wife who acted under her maiden name of Grace Hardwill. She felt pretty sure that with a marquess and marchioness to hover round and a Cabinet Minister to be impressed by, Tom would not go off to play golf with Roger or spend the afternoon in a punt. In such a party Roger would sink into his proper place of a schoolboy that no one took any notice of, and Tom would see how brilliant she could be when she took the trouble. In the anticipation of her triumph she managed to bear the intervening days with fortitude. She saw little of Roger and Tom. On her matinée days she did not see them at all. If they were not playing some game they were careering about the country in Roger's car.

Julia drove the Dennorants down after the play. Roger had gone to bed, but Michael and Tom were waiting up to have supper with them. It was a very good supper. The servants had gone to bed too and they helped themselves. Julia noticed the shy eagerness with which Tom saw that the Dennorants had everything they wanted, and his alacrity to jump up if he could be of service. His civility was somewhat officious. The Dennorants were an unassuming young couple to whom it had never occurred that their rank could impress anyone, and George Dennorant was a little embarrassed when Tom took away his dirty plate and handed him a dish to help himself to the next course.

“No golf for Roger tomorrow, I think,” said Julia to herself.

They stayed up talking and laughing till three in the morning, and when Tom said good-night to her his eyes were shining; but whether from love or champagne she did not know. He pressed her hand.

“What a lovely party,” he said.

It was late when Julia, dressed in organdie, looking her best, came down into the garden. She saw Roger in a long chair with a book.

“Reading?” she said, lifting her really beautiful eyebrows. “Why aren't you playing golf?”

Roger looked a trifle sulky.

“Tom said it was too hot.”

“Oh?” she smiled charmingly. “I was afraid you thought you ought to stay and entertain my guests. There are going to be so many people, we could easily have managed without you. Where are the others?”

“I don't know. Tom's making chichi with Cecily Dennorant.”

“She's very pretty, you know.”

“It looks to me as though it's going to be a crashing bore today.”

“I hope Tom won't find it so,” she said, as though she were seriously concerned.

Roger remained silent.

The day passed exactly as she had hoped. It was true that she saw little of Tom, but Roger saw less. Tom made a great hit with the Dennorants; he explained to them how they could get out of paying as much income tax as they did. He listened respectfully to the Chancellor while he discoursed on the stage and to Archie Dexter while he gave his views on the political situation. Julia was at the top of her form. Archie Dexter had a quick wit, a fund of stage stories and a wonderful gift for telling them; between the two of them they kept the table during lunch laughing uproariously; and after tea, when the tennis players were tired of playing tennis, Julia was persuaded (not much against her will) to do her imitations of Gladys Cooper, Constance Collier and Gertie Lawrence. But Julia did not forget that Charles Tamerley was her devoted, unrewarded lover, and she took care to have a little stroll alone with him in the gloaming. With him she sought to be neither gay nor brilliant, she was tender and wistful. Her heart ached, notwithstanding the scintillating performance she had given during the day; and it was with almost complete sincerity that with sighs, sad looks and broken sentences she made him understand that her life was hollow and despite the long-continued success of her career she could not but feel that she had missed something. Sometimes she thought of the villa at Sorrento on the bay of Naples. A beautiful dream. Happiness might have been hers for the asking, perhaps; she had been a fool; after all what were the triumphs of the stage but illusion? Pagliacci. People never realized how true that was; Vesti la giubba and all that sort of thing. She was desperately lonely. Of course there was no need to tell Charles that her heart ached not for lost opportunities, but because a young man seemed to prefer playing golf with her son to making love to her.

But then Julia and Archie Dexter got together. After dinner when they were all sitting in the drawing-room, without warning, starting with a few words of natural conversation they burst, as though they were lovers, into a jealous quarrel. For a moment the rest did not realize it was a joke till their mutual accusations became so outrageous and indecent that they were consumed with laughter. Then they played an extempore scene of an intoxicated gentleman picking up a French tart in Jermyn Street. After that, with intense seriousness, while their little audience shook with laughter, they did Mrs. Alving in Ghosts trying to seduce Pastor Manders. They finished with a performance that they had given often enough before at theatrical parties to enable them to do it with effect. This was a Chekhov play in English, but in moments of passion breaking into something that sounded exactly like Russian. Julia exercised all her great gift for tragedy, but underlined it with a farcical emphasis, so that the effect was incredibly funny. She put into her performance the real anguish of her heart, and with her lively sense of the ridiculous made a mock of it. The audience rolled about in their chairs; they held their sides; they groaned in an agony of laughter. Perhaps Julia had never acted before. She was acting for Tom and for him alone.

“I've seen Bernhardt and Réjane,” said the Chancellor; “I've seen Duse and Ellen Terry and Mrs. Kendal. Nunc Dimittis.”

Julia, radiant, sank back into a chair and swallowed at a draught a glass of champagne.

“If I haven't cooked Roger's goose I'll eat my hat,” she thought.

But for all that the two lads had gone off to play golf when she came downstairs next morning. Michael had taken the Dennorants up to town. Julia was tired. She found it an effort to be bright and chatty when Tom and Roger came in to lunch. In the afternoon the three of them went on the river, but Julia had the feeling that they took her, not because they much wanted to, but because they could not help it. She stifled a sigh when she reflected how much she had looked forward to Tom's holiday. Now she was counting the days that must pass till it ended. She drew a deep breath of relief when she got into the car to go to London. She was not angry with Tom, but deeply hurt; she was exasperated with herself because she had so lost control over her feelings. But when she got into the theatre she felt that she shook off the obsession of him like a bad dream from which one awoke; there, in her dressing-rom, she regained possession of herself and the affairs of the common round of daily life faded to insignificance. Nothing really mattered when she had within her grasp this possibility of freedom.

Thus the week went by. Michael, Roger and Tom enjoyed themselves. They bathed, they played tennis, they played golf, they lounged about on the river. There were only four days more. There were only three days more.

(“I can stick it out now. It'll be different when we're back in London again. I mustn't show how miserable I am. I must pretend it's all right.”)

“A snip having this spell of fine weather,” said Michael. “Tom's been a success, hasn't he? Pity he can't stay another week.”

“Yes, a terrible pity.”

“I think he's a nice friend for Roger to have. A thoroughly normal, clean-minded English boy.”

“Oh, thoroughly.” (“Bloody fool, bloody fool.”)

“To see the way they eat is a fair treat.”

“Yes, they seem to have enjoyed their food.” (“My God, I wish it could have choked them.”)

Tom was to go up to town by an early train on Monday morning. The Dexters, who had a house at Bourne End, had asked them all to lunch on Sunday. They were to go down in the launch. Now that Tom's holiday was nearly over Julia was glad that she had never by so much as a lifted eyebrow betrayed her irritation. She was certain that he had no notion how deeply he had wounded her. After all she must be tolerant, he was only a boy, and if you must cross your t's, she was old enough to be his mother. It was a bore that she had a thing about him, but there it was, she couldn't help it; she had told herself from the beginning that she must never let him feel that she had any claims on him. No one was coming to dinner on Sunday. She would have liked to have Tom to herself on his last evening; that was impossible, but at all events they could go for a stroll by themselves in the garden.

“I wonder if he's noticed that he hasn't kissed me since he came here?”

They might go out in the punt. It would be heavenly to lie in his arms for a few minutes; it would make up for everything.

The Dexters' party was theatrical. Grace Hardwill, Archie's wife, played in musical comedy, and there was a bevy of pretty girls who danced in the piece in which she was then appearing. Julia acted with great naturalness the part of a leading lady who put on no frills. She was charming to the young ladies, with their waved platinum hair, who earned three pounds a week in the chorus. A good many of the guests had brought kodaks and she submitted with affability to being photographed. She applauded enthusiastically when Grace Hardwill sang her famous song to the accompaniment of the composer. She laughed as heartily as anyone when the comic woman did an imitation of her in one of her best-known parts. It was all very gay, rather rowdy, and agreeably light-hearted. Julia enjoyed herself, but when it was seven o'clock was not sorry to go. She was thanking her hosts effusively for the pleasant party when Roger came up to her.

“I say, Mum, there's a whole crowd going on to Maidenhead to dine and dance, and they want Tom and me to go too. You don't mind, do you?”

The blood rushed to her cheeks. She could not help answering rather sharply.

“How are you to get back?”

“Oh, that'll be all right. We'll get someone to drop us.”

She looked at him helplessly. She could not think what to say.

“It's going to be a tremendous lark. Tom's crazy to go.”

Her heart sank. It was with the greatest difficulty that she managed not to make a scene. But she controlled herself.

“All right, darling. But don't be too late. Remember that Tom's got to rise with the lark.”

Tom had come up and heard the last words.

“You're sure you don't mind?” he asked.

“Of course not. I hope you'll have a grand time.”

She smiled brightly at him, but her eyes were steely with hatred.

“I'm just as glad those two kids have gone off,” said Michael when they got into the launch. “We haven't had an evening to ourselves for ever so long.”

She clenched her hands in order to prevent herself from telling him to hold his silly tongue. She was in a black rage. This was the last straw. Tom had neglected her for a fortnight, he had not even treated her with civility, and she had been angelic. There wasn't a woman in the world who would have shown such patience. Any other woman would have told him that if he couldn't behave with common decency he'd better get out. Selfish, stupid and common, that's what he was. She almost wished he wasn't going tomorrow so that she could have the pleasure of turning him out bag and baggage. And to dare to treat her like that, a twopenny-halfpenny little man in the city; poets, cabinet ministers, peers of the realm would be only to glad to break the most important engagements to have the chance of dining with her, and he threw her over to go and dance with a pack of peroxide blondes who couldn't act for nuts. That showed what a fool he was. You would have thought he'd have some gratitude. Why, the very clothes he had on she'd paid for. That cigarette-case he was so proud of, hadn't she given him that? And the ring he wore. My God, she'd get even with him. Yes, and she knew how she could do it. She knew where he was most sensitive and how she could most cruelly wound him. That would get him on the raw. She felt a faint sensation of relief as she turned the scheme over in her mind. She was impatient to carry out her part of it at once, and they had no sooner got home than she went up to her room. She got four single pounds out of her bag and a ten-shilling note. She wrote a brief letter.

DEAR TOM,

I'm enclosing the money for your tips as I shan't see you in the morning. Give three pounds to the butler, a pound to the maid who's been valeting you, and ten shillings to the chauffeur.

JULIA.

She sent for Evie and gave instructions that the letter should be given to Tom by the maid who awoke him. When she went down to dinner she felt much better. She carried on an animated conversation with Michael while they dined and afterwards they played six-pack bezique. If she had racked her brains for a week she couldn't have thought of anything that would humiliate Tom more bitterly.

But when she went to bed she could not sleep. She was waiting for Roger and Tom to come home. A notion came to her that made her restless. Perhaps Tom would realize that he had behaved rottenly, if he gave it a moment's thought he must see how unhappy he was making her; it might be that he would be sorry and when he came in, after he had said good-night to Roger, he would creep down to her room. If he did that she would forgive everything. The letter was probably in the butler's pantry; she could easily slip down and get it back. At last a car drove up. She turned on her light to look at the time. It was three. She heard the two young men go upstairs and to their respective rooms. She waited. She put on the light by her bedside so that when he opened the door he should be able to see. She would pretend she was sleeping and then as he crept forward on tiptoe slowly open her eyes and smile at him. She waited. In the silent night she heard him get into bed and switch off the light. She stared straight in front of her for a minute, then with a shrug of the shoulders opened a drawer by her bedside and from a little bottle took a couple of sleeping-tablets.

“If I don't sleep I shall go mad.”





Chapter 15


Julia did not wake till after eleven. Among her letters was one that had not come by post. She recognized Tom's neat, commercial hand and tore it open. It contained nothing but the four pounds and the ten-shilling note. She felt slightly sick. She did not quite know what she had expected him to reply to her condescending letter and the humiliating present. It had not occurred to her that he would return it. She was troubled, she had wanted to hurt his feelings, but she had a fear now that she had gone too far.

“Anyhow I hope he tipped the servants,” she muttered to reassure herself. She shrugged her shoulders. “He'll come round. It won't hurt him to discover that I'm not all milk and honey.”

But she remained thoughtful throughout the day. When she got to the theatre a parcel was waiting for her. As soon as she looked at the address she knew what it contained. Evie asked if she should open it.

“No.”

But the moment she was alone she opened it herself. There were the cuff-links and the waistcoat buttons, the pearl studs, the wrist-watch and the cigarette-case of which Tom was so proud. Not a word of explanation. Her heart sank and she noticed that she was trembling.

“What a damned fool I was! Why didn't I keep my temper?”

Her heart now beat painfully. She couldn't go on the stage with that anguish gnawing at her vitals, she would give a frightful performance; at whatever cost she must speak to him. There was a telephone in his house and an extension to his room. She rang him. Fortunately he was in.

“Tom.”

“Yes?”

He had paused for a moment before answering and his voice was peevish.

“What does this mean? Why have you sent me all those things?

“Did you get the notes this morning?”

“Yes. I couldn't make head or tail of it. Have I offended you?”

“Oh, no,” he answered. “I like being treated like a kept boy. I like having it thrown in my face that even my tips have to be given me. I thought it rather strange that you didn't send me the money for a third-class ticket back to London.”

Although Julia was in a pitiable state of anxiety, so that she could hardly get the words out of her mouth, she almost smiled at his fatuous irony. He was a silly little thing.

“But you can't imagine that I wanted to hurt your feelings. You surely know me well enough to know that's the last thing I should do.”

“That only makes it worse.” (“Damn and curse,” thought Julia.) “I ought never to have let you make me those presents. I should never have let you lend me money.”

“I don't know what you mean. It's all some horrible misunderstanding. Come and fetch me after the play and we'll have it out. I know I can explain.”

“I'm going to dinner with my people and I shall sleep at home.”

“Tomorrow then.”

“I'm engaged tomorrow.”

“I must see you, Tom. We've been too much to one another to part like this. You can't condemn me unheard. It's so unjust to punish me for no fault of mine.”

“I think it's much better that we shouldn't meet again.”

Julia was growing desperate.

“But I love you, Tom. I love you. Let me see you once more and then, if you're still angry with me, we'll call it a day.”

There was a long pause before he answered.

“All right. I'll come after the matinée on Wednesday.”

“Don't think unkindly of me, Tom.”

She put down the receiver. At all events he was coming. She wrapped up again the things he had returned to her, and hid them away where she was pretty sure Evie would not see them. She undressed, put on her old pink dressing-gown and began to make up. She was out of humour: this was the first time she had ever told him that she loved him. It vexed her that she had been forced to humiliate herself by begging him to come and see her. Till then it had always been he who sought her company. She was not pleased to think that the situation between them now was openly reversed.

Julia gave a very poor performance at the matinée on Wednesday. The heat wave had affected business and the house was apathetic. Julia was indifferent. With that sickness of apprehension gnawing at her heart she could not care how the play went. (“What the hell do they want to come to the theatre for on a day like this anyway?”) She was glad when it was over.

“I'm expecting Mr. Fennell,” she told Evie. “While he's here I don't want to be disturbed.”

Evie did not answer. Julia gave her a glance and saw that she was looking grim.

(“To hell with her. What do I care what she thinks!”)

He ought to have been there by now. It was after five. He was bound to come; after all, he'd promised, hadn't he? She put on a dressing-gown, not the one she made up in, but a man's dressing-gown, in plum-coloured silk. Evie took an interminable time to put things straight.

“For God's sake don't fuss, Evie. Leave me alone.”

Evie did not speak. She went on methodically arranging the various objects on the dressing-table exactly as Julia always wanted them.

“Why the devil don't you answer when I speak to you?”

Evie turned round and looked at her. She thoughtfully rubbed her finger along her nostrils.

“Great actress you may be…”

“Get the hell out of here.”

After taking off her stage make-up Julia had done nothing to her face except put the very faintest shading of blue under her eyes. She had a smooth, pale skin and without rouge on her cheeks or red on her lips she looked wan. The man's dressing-gown gave an effect at once helpless, fragile and gallant. Her heart was beating painfully and she was very anxious, but looking at herself in the glass she murmured: Mimi in the last act of Bohème. Almost without meaning to she coughed once or twice consumptively. She turned off the bright lights on her dressing-table and lay down on the sofa. Presently there was a knock at the door and Evie announced Mr. Fennell. Julia held out a white, thin hand.

“I'm lying down. I'm afraid I'm not very well. Find yourself a chair. It's nice of you to come.”

“I'm sorry. What's the matter?”

“Oh, nothing.” She forced a smile to her ashy lips. “I haven't been sleeping very well the last two or three nights.”

She turned her beautiful eyes on him and for a while gazed at him in silence. His expression was sullen, but she had a notion that he was frightened.

“I'm waiting for you to tell me what you've got against me,” she said at last in a low voice.

It trembled a little, she noticed, but quite naturally. (“Christ, I believe I'm frightened too.”)

“There's no object in going back to that. The only thing I wanted to say to you was this: I'm afraid I can't pay you the two hundred pounds I owe you right away, I simply haven't got it, but I'll pay you by degrees. I hate having to ask you to give me time, but I can't help myself.”

She sat up on the sofa and put both her hands to her breaking heart.

“I don't understand. I've lain awake for two whole nights turning it all over in my mind. I thought I should go mad. I've been trying to understand. I can't. I can't.”

(“What play did I say that in?”)

“Oh yes, you can, you understand perfectly. You were angry with me and you wanted to get back on me. And you did. You got back on me all right. You couldn't have shown your contempt for me more clearly.”

“But why should I want to get back on you? Why should I be angry with you?”

“Because I went to Maidenhead with Roger to that party and you wanted me to come home.”

“But I told you to go. I said I hoped you'd have a good time.”

“I know you did, but your eyes were blazing with passion. I didn't want to go, but Roger was keen on it. I told him I thought we ought to come back and dine with you and Michael, but he said you'd be glad to have us off your hands, and I didn't like to make a song and dance about it. And when I saw you were in a rage it was too late to get out of it.”

“I wasn't in a rage. I can't think how you got such an idea in your head. It was so natural that you should want to go to the party. You can't think I'm such a beast as to grudge you a little fun in your fortnight's holiday. My poor lamb, my only fear was that you would be bored. I so wanted you to have a good time.”

“Then why did you send me that money and write me that letter? It was so insulting.”

Julia's voice faltered. Her jaw began to tremble and the loss of control over her muscles was strangely moving. Tom looked away uneasily.

“I couldn't bear to think of you having to throw away your good money on tips. I know that you're not terribly rich and I knew you'd spent a lot on green fees. I hate women who go about with young men and let them pay for everything. It's so inconsiderate. I treated you just as I'd have treated Roger. I never thought it would hurt your feelings.”

“Will you swear that?”

“Of course I will. My God, is it possible that after all these months you don't know me better than that? If what you think were true, what a mean, cruel, despicable woman I should be, what a cad, what a heartless, vulgar beast! Is that what you think I am?”

A poser.

“Anyhow it doesn't matter. I ought never to have accepted valuable presents from you and allowed you to lend me money. It's put me in a rotten position. Why I thought you despised me is that I can't help feeling that you've got a right to. The fact is I can't afford to run around with people who are so much richer than I am. I was a fool to think I could. It's been fun and I've had a grand time, but now I'm through. I'm not going to see you any more.”

She gave a deep sigh.

“You don't care two hoots for me. That's what that means.”

“That's not fair.”

“You're everything in the world to me. You know that. I'm so lonely and your friendship meant a great deal to me. I'm surrounded by hangers-on and parasites and I knew you were disinterested. I felt I could rely on you. I so loved being with you. You were the only person in the world with whom I could be entirely myself. Don't you know what a pleasure it was to me to help you a little? It wasn't for your sake I made you little presents, it was for my own; it made me so happy to see you using the things I'd given you. If you'd cared for me at all they wouldn't have humiliated you, you'd have been touched to owe me something.”

She turned her eyes on him once more. She could always cry easily, and she was really so miserable now that she did not have to make even a small effort. He had never seen her cry before. She could cry, without sobbing, her wonderful dark eyes wide open, with a face that was almost rigid. Great heavy tears ran down it. And her quietness, the immobility of the tragic body, were terribly moving. She hadn't cried like that since she cried in The Stricken Heart. Christ, how that play had shattered her. She was not looking at Tom, she was looking straight in front of her; she was really distracted with grief, but, what was it? Another self within her knew what she was doing, a self that shared in her unhappiness and yet watched its expression. She felt him go white. She felt a sudden anguish wring his heartstrings, she felt that his flesh and blood could not support the intolerable pain of hers.

“Julia.”

His voice was broken. She slowly turned her liquid eyes on him. It was not a woman crying that he saw, it was all the woe of human kind, it was the immeasurable, the inconsolable grief that is the lot of man. He threw himself down on his knees and took her in his arms. He was shattered.

“Dearest, dearest.”

For a minute she did not move. It was as if she did not know that he was there. He kissed her streaming eyes and with his mouth sought hers. She gave it to him as though she were powerless, as though, scarcely conscious of what was befalling her, she had no will left. With a scarcely perceptible movement she pressed her body to his and gradually her arms found their way round his neck. She lay in his arms, not exactly inert, but as though all the strength, all the vitality, had gone out of her. In his mouth he tasted the saltness of her tears. At last, exhausted, clinging to him with soft arms she sank back on the sofa. His lips clung to hers.

You would never have thought had you seen her a quarter of an hour later, so quietly gay, flushed a little, that so short a while before she had passed through such a tempest of weeping. They each had a whisky and soda and a cigarette and looked at one another with fond eyes.

“He's a sweet little thing,” she thought.

It occurred to her that she would give him a treat.

“The Duke and Duchess of Rickaby are coming to the play tonight and we're going to have supper at the Savoy. I suppose you wouldn't come, would you? I want a man badly to make a fourth.”

“If you'd like me to, of course I will.”

The heightened colour on his cheeks told her how excited he was to meet such distinguished persons. She did not tell him that the Rickabys would go anywhere for a free meal. Tom took back the presents that he had returned to her rather shyly, but he took them. When he had gone she sat down at the dressing-table and had a good look at herself.

“How lucky I am that I can cry without my eyelids swelling,” she said. She massaged them a little. “All the same, what mugs men are.”

She was happy. Everything would be all right now. She had got him back. But somewhere, at the back of her mind or in the bottom of her heart, was a feeling of ever so slight contempt for Tom because he was such a simple fool.





Chapter 16


Their quarrel, destroying in some strange way the barrier between them, brought them closer together. Tom offered less resistance than she had expected when she mooted once more the question of the flat. It looked as though, after their reconciliation, having taken back her presents and consented to forget the loan,he had put aside his moral scruples. They had a lot of fun furnishing it. The chauffeur's wife kept it clean for him and cooked his breakfast. Julia had a key and would sometimes let herself in and sit by herself in the little sitting-room till he came back from his office. They supped together two or three times a week and danced, then drove back to the flat in a taxi. Julia enjoyed a happy autumn. The play they put on was a success. She felt alert and young. Roger was coming home at Christmas, but only for a fortnight, and was then going to Vienna. Julia expected him to monopolize Tom and she was determined not to mind. Youth naturally appealed to youth and she told herself that there was no reason for her to feel anxious if for a few days the two of them were so wrapped up in one another that Tom had no thought for her. She held him now. He was proud to be her lover, it gave him confidence in himself, and he was pleased to be on familiar terms with a large number of more or less distinguished persons whom after all he only knew through her. He was anxious now to join a good club and Julia was preparing the ground. Charles had never refused her anything, and with tact she was certain that she could wheedle him into proposing Tom for one of those to which he belonged. It was a new and delicious sensation for Tom to have money to spend; she encouraged him to be extravagant; she had a notion that he would get used to living in a certain way and then would realize that he could not do without her.

“Of course it can't last,” she told herself, “but when it comes to an end it will have been a wonderful experience for him. It'll really have made a man of him.”

But though she told herself that it could not last she did not see really why it shouldn't. As the years went by and he grew older there wouldn't be any particular difference between them. He would no longer be so very young in ten or fifteen years and she would be just the same age as she was now. They were very comfortable together. Men were creatures of habit; that gave women such a hold on them. She did not feel a day older than he, and she was convinced that the disparity in their ages had never even occurred to him. It was true that on this point she had once had a moment's disquietude. She was lying on his bed. He was standing at the dressing-table, in his shirt sleeves, brushing his hair. She was stark naked and she lay in the position of a Venus by Titian that she remembered to have seen in a country house at which she had stayed. She felt that she made really a lovely picture, and in complete awareness of the charming sight she offered, held the pose. She was happy and satisfied.

“This is romance,” she thought, and a light, quick smile hovered over her lips.

He caught sight of her in the mirror, turned round and without a word, twitched the sheet over her. Though she smiled at him affectionately, it gave her quitea turn. Was he afraid that she would catch cold, or was it that his English modesty was shocked at her nakedness? Or could it be that, his boyish lust satisfied, he was a trifle disgusted at the sight of her ageing body? When she got home she again took all her clothes off and examined herself in the looking-glass. She determined not to spare herself. She looked at her neck, there was no sign of age there, especially when she held her chin up; and her breasts were small and firm; they might have been a girl's. Her belly was flat, her hips were small, there was a very small roll of fat there, like a long sausage, but everyone had that, and anyhow Miss Phillips could have a go at it. No one could say that her legs weren't good, they were long and slim and comely; she passed her hands over her body, her skin was as soft as velvet and there wasn't a blemish on it. Of course there were a few wrinkles under her eyes, but you had to peer to see them; they said there was an operation now by which you could get rid of them, it might be worth while to inquire into that; it was lucky that her hair had retained its colour; however well hair was dyed, to dye hardened the face; hers remained a rich, deep brown. Her teeth were all right too.

“Prudishness, that's all it was.”

She had a moment's recollection of the Spaniard with the beard in the wagon-lit and she smiled roguishly at herself in the glass.

“No damned modesty about him.”

But all the same from that day on she took care to act up to Tom's standards of decency.

Julia's reputation was so good that she felt she need not hesitate to show herself with Tom in public places. It was a new experience for her to go to night-clubs, she enjoyed it, and though no one could have been better aware than she that she could go nowhere without being stared at, it never entered her head that such a change in her habits must excite comment. With twenty years of fidelity behind her, for of course she did not count the Spaniard, an accident that might happen to any woman, Julia was confident that no one would imagine for a moment that she was having an affair with a boy young enough to be her son. It never occurred to her that perhaps Tom was not always so discreet as he might have been. It never occurred to her that the look in her eyes when they danced together betrayed her. She looked upon her position as so privileged that it never occurred to her that people at last were beginning to gossip.

When this gossip reached the ears of Dolly de Vries she laughed. At Julia's request she had invited Tom to parties and once or twice had him down for a weekend in the country, but she had never paid any attention to him. He seemed a nice little thing, a useful escort for Julia when Michael was busy, but perfectly insignificant. He was one of those persons who everywhere pass unnoticed, and even after you had met him you could not remember what he was like. He was the extra man you invited to dinner to make an odd number even. Julia talked of him gaily as “me boy friend” or as “my young man”; she could hardly have been so cool about it, so open, if there were anything in it. Besides, Dolly knew very well that the only two men there had ever been in Julia's life were Michael and Charles Tamerley. But it was funny of Julia, after taking so much care of herself for years, suddenly to start going to night-clubs three or four times a week. Dolly had seen little of her of late and indeed had been somewhat piqued by her neglect. She had many friends in theatrical circles and she began to make enquiries. She did not at all like what she heard. She did not know what to think. One thing was evident, Julia couldn't know what was being said about her, and someone must tell her. Not she; she hadn't the courage. Even after all these years she was a little frightened of Julia. Julia was a very good-tempered woman, and though her language was often brusque it was hard to ruffle her; but there was something about her that prevented you from taking liberties with her; you had a feeling that if once you went too far you would regret it. But something must be done. Dolly turned the matter over in her mind for a fortnight, anxiously; she tried to put her own wounded feelings aside and look at it only from the point of view of Julia's career, and at last she came to the conclusion that Michael must speak to her. She had never liked Michael, but after all he was Julia's husband and it was her duty to tell him at least enough to make him put a stop to whatever was going on.

She rang Michael up and made an appointment with him at the theatre. Michael liked Dolly as little as she liked him, though for other reasons, and when he heard that she wanted to see him he swore. He was annoyed that he had never been able to induce her to sell out her shares in the management, and he resented whatever suggestions she made as an unwarrantable interference. But when she was shown in to his office he greeted her with cordiality. He kissed her on both cheeks.

“Sit down and make yourself comfy. Come to see that the old firm's still raking in dividends for you?”

Dolly de Vries was now a woman of sixty. She was very fat, and her face, with its large nose and heavy red lips, seemed larger than life. There was a slightly masculine touch in her black satin dress, but she wore a double string of pearls round her neck, a diamond brooch at her waist and another in her hat. Her short hair was dyed a rich copper. Her lips and her fingernails were bright red. Her voice was loud and deep, but when she got excited the words were apt to tumble over one another and a slight cockney accent revealed itself.

“Michael, I'm upset about Julia.”

Michael, always the perfect gentleman, slightly raised his eyebrows and compressed his thin lips. He was not prepared to discuss his wife even with Dolly.

“I think she's doing a great deal too much. I don't know what's come over her. All these parties she's going to now. These nightclubs and things. After all,she's not a young woman any more; she'll just wear herself out.”

“Oh, nonsense. She's as strong as a horse and she's in the best of health. She's looking younger than she has for years. You're not going to grudge her a bit of fun when her day's work is over. The part she's playing just now doesn't take it out of her; I'm very glad that she should want to go out and amuse herself. It only shows how much vitality she has.”

“She never cared for that sort of thing before. It seems so strange that she should suddenly take to dancing till two in the morning in the horrible atmosphere of those places.”

“It's the only exercise she gets. I can't expect her to put on shorts and come for a run with me in the park.”

“I think you ought to know that people are beginning to talk. It's doing her reputation a lot of harm.”

“What the devil d'you mean by that?”

“Well, it's absurd that at her age she should make herself so conspicuous with a young boy.”

He looked at her for a moment without understanding, and when he caught what she meant he laughed loud.

“Tom? Don't be such a fool, Dolly.”

“I'm not a fool. I know what I'm talking about. When anyone's as well known as Julia and she's always about with the same man naturally people talk.”

“But Tom's just as much my friend as hers. You know very well that I can't take Julia out dancing. I have to get up every morning at eight to get my exercise in before my day's work. Hang it all, I do know something about human nature after thirty years on the stage. Tom's a very good type of clean, honest English boy and he's by way of being a gentleman. I daresay he admires Julia, boys of that age often think they're in love with women older than themselves, well, it won't do him any harm, it'll do him good; but to think Julia could possibly give him a thought—my poor Dolly, you make me laugh.”

“He's boring, he's dull, he's common and he's a snob.”

“Well, if you think he's all that doesn't it strike you as rather strange that Julia should be so wrapped up in him as you seem to think?”

“Only a woman knows what a woman can do.”

“That's not a bad line, Dolly. We shall have you writing a play next. Now let's get this straight. Can you look me in the face and tell me that you really think Julia is having an affair with Tom?”

She looked him in the face. Her eyes were anguished. For though at first she had only laughed at what was being said about Julia she had not been able altogether to suppress the doubts that soon assailed her; she remembered a dozen little incidents that at the time had escaped her notice, but when considered in cold blood looked terribly suspicious. She had suffered such torture as she had never thought it possible to endure. Proof? She had no proof; she only had an intuition that she could not mistrust; she wanted to say yes, the impulse to do so was almost uncontrollable; she controlled it. She could not give Julia away. The fool might go and tell her and Julia would never speak to her again. He might have Julia watched and catch her out. No one could tell what might happen if she told the truth.

“No, I don't.”

Her eyes filled with tears and began to roll down her massive cheeks. Michael saw her misery. He thought her ridiculous, but he realized that she was suffering and in the kindness of his heart sought to console her.

“I was sure you didn't really. You know how fond Julia is of you, you mustn't be jealous, you know, if she has other friends.”

“God knows I don't grudge her anything,” she sobbed. “She's been so different to me lately. She's been so cold. I've been such a loyal friend to her, Michael.”

“Yes, dear, I know you have.”

“Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my King…”

“Oh, come now, it's not so bad as that. You know, I'm not the sort of chap to talk about his wife to other people. I always think that's such frightfully bad form. But you know, honestly you don't know the first thing about Julia. Sex doesn't mean a thing to her. When we were first married it was different, and I don't mind telling you after all these years that she made life a bit difficult for me. I don't say she was a nymphomaniac or anything like that, but she was inclined to be rather tiresome sometimes. Bed's all very well in its way, but there are other things in life. But after Roger was born she changed completely. Having a baby settled her. All those instincts went into her acting. You've read Freud, Dolly; what does he call it when that happens?”

“Oh, Michael, what do I care about Freud?”

“Sublimation. That's it. I often think that's what's made her such a great actress. Acting's a whole-time job, and if you want to be really good you've got to give your whole self to it. I'm so impatient with the public who think actors and actresses lead a devil of a life. We haven't got the time for that sort of nonsense.”

What Michael was saying made her so angry that she recovered her self-control.

“But Michael, it may be that you and I know that there's nothing wrong in Julia's going about all the time with that miserable little pip-squeak. It's so bad for her reputation. After all, one of your great assets has been your exemplary married life. Everyone has looked up to you. The public has loved to think of you as such a devoted and united couple.”

“And so we are, damn it.”

Dolly was growing impatient.

“But I tell you people are talking. You can't be so stupid as not to see that they're bound to. I mean, if Julia had had one flagrant affair after another, nobody would take any notice, but after the life she's led for so many years suddenly to break out like this— naturally everybody starts chattering. It's so bad for business.”

Michael gave her a swift glance. He smiled a little.

“I see what you mean, Dolly. I daresay there's something in what you say and in the circumstances I feel that you have a perfect right to say it. You were awfully good to us when we started and I should hate to see you let down now. I'll tell you what, I'll buy you out.”

“Buy me out?”

Dolly straightened herself and her face, a moment ago rumpled and discomposed, hardened. She was seized with indignation. He went on suavely.

“I see your point. If Julia's gadding about all night it must tell on her performances. That's obvious. She's got a funny sort of public, a lot of old ladies come to our matinées because they think she's such a sweet good woman. I don't mind admitting that if she gets herself unpleasantly talked about it might have some effect on the takings. I know Julia well enough to know that she wouldn't put up with any interference with her liberty of action. I'm her husband and I've got to put up with it. But you're in a different position altogether. I shouldn't blame you if you wanted to get out while the going was good.”

Dolly was alert now. She was far from a fool and when it came to business was a match for Michael. She was angry, but her anger gave her self-control.

“I should have thought after all these years, Michael, that you knew me better than that. I thought it my duty to warn you, but I'm prepared to take the rough with the smooth. I'm not the woman to desert a sinking ship. I daresay I can afford to lose my money better than you can.”

It gave her a great deal of satisfaction to see the disappointment that was clearly expressed on Michael's face. She knew how much money meant to him and she had a hope that what she had said would rankle. He pulled himself together quickly.

“Well, think it over, Dolly.”

She gathered up her bag and they parted with mutual expressions of affection and good will.

“Silly old bitch,” he said when the door was closed behind her.

“Pompous old ass,” she hissed as she went down in the lift.

But when she got into her magnificent and very expensive car and drove back to Montagu Square she could not hold back the heavy, painful tears that filled her eyes. She felt old, lonely, unhappy, and desperately jealous.





Chapter 17


Michael flattered himself on his sense of humour. On the Sunday evening that followed his conversation with Dolly he strolled into Julia's room while she was dressing. They were going to the pictures after an early dinner.

“Who's coming tonight besides Charles?” he asked her.

“I couldn't find another woman. I've asked Tom.”

“Good! I wanted to see him.”

He chuckled at the thought of the joke he had up his sleeve. Julia was looking forward to the evening. At the cinema she would arrange the seating so that Tom sat next to her and he would hold her hand while she chatted in undertones to Charles on the other side of her. Dear Charles, it was nice of him to have loved her so long and so devotedly; she would go out of her way to be very sweet to him. Charles and Tom arrived together. Tom was wearing his new dinner-jacket for the first time and he and Julia exchanged a little private glance, of satisfaction on his part and of compliment on hers.

“Well, young feller,” said Michael heartily, rubbing his hands, “do you know what I hear about you? I hear that you're compromising my wife.”

Tom gave him a startled look and went scarlet. The habit of flushing mortified him horribly, but he could not break himself of it.

“Oh, my dear,” cried Julia gaily, “how marvellous! I've been trying to get someone to compromise me all my life. Who told you, Michael?”

“A little bird,” he said archly.

“Well, Tom, if Michael divorces me you'll have to marry me, you know.”

Charles smiled with his gentle, rather melancholy eyes.

“What have you been doing, Tom?” he asked.

Charles was gravely, Michael boisterously, diverted by the young man's obvious embarrassment. Julia, though she seemed to share their amusement, was alert and watchful.

“Well, it appears that the young rip has been taking Julia to night-clubs when she ought to have been in bed and asleep.”

Julia crowed with delight.

“Shall we deny it, Tom, or shall we brazen it out?”

“Well, I'll tell you what I said to the little bird,” Michael broke in. “I said to her, as long as Julia doesn't want me to go to nightclubs with her…”

Julia ceased to listen to what he said. Dolly, she thought, and oddly enough she described her to herself in exactly the words Michael had used a couple of days before. Dinner was announced and their bright talk turned to other things. But though Julia took part in it with gaiety, though she appeared to be giving her guests all her attention and even listened with a show of appreciation to one of Michael's theatrical stories that she had heard twenty times before, she was privately holding an animated conversation with Dolly. Dolly cowered before her while she told her exactly what she thought of her.

“You old cow,” she said to her. “How dare you interfere with my private concerns? No, don't speak. Don't try to excuse yourself. I know exactly what you said to Michael. It was unpardonable. I thought you were a friend of mine. I thought I could rely on you. Well, that finishes it. I'll never speak to you again. Never. Never. D'you think I'm impressed by your rotten old money? Oh, it's no good saying you didn't mean it. Where would you be except for me, I should like to know. Any distinction you've got, the only importance you have in the world, is that you happen to know me. Who's made your parties go all these years? D'you think that people came to them to see you? They came to see me. Never again. Never.”

It was in point of fact a monologue rather than a conversation.

Later on, at the cinema, she sat next to Tom as she had intended and held his hand, but it seemed to her singularly unresponsive. Like a fish's fin. She suspected that he was thinking uncomfortably of what Michael had said. She wished that she had had an opportunity of a few words with him so that she might have told him not to worry. After all no one could have carried off the incident with more brilliance than she had. Aplomb; that was the word. She wondered what it was exactly that Dolly had told Michael. She had better find out. It would not do to ask Michael, that would look as though she attached importance to it; she must find out from Dolly herself. It would be much wiser not to have a row with her. Julia smiled as she thought of the scene she would have with Dolly. She would be sweetness itself, she would wheedle it all out of her, and never give her an inkling that she was angry. It was curious that it should send a cold shiver down her back to think that people were talking about her. After all if she couldn't do what she liked who could? Her private life was nobody's business. All the same one couldn't deny that it wouldn't be very nice if people were laughing at her. She wondered what Michael would do if he found out the truth. He couldn't very well divorce her and continue to manage for her. If he had any sense he'd shut his eyes. But Michael was funny in some ways; every now and then he would get up on his hind legs and start doing his colonel stuff. He was quite capable of saying all of a sudden that damn it all, he must behave like a gentleman. Men were such fools; there wasn't one of them who wouldn't cut off his nose to spite his face. Of course it wouldn't really matter very much to her. She could go and act in America for a year till the scandal had died down and then go into management with somebody else. But it would be a bore. And then there was Roger to consider; he'd feel it, poor lamb; he'd be humiliated, naturally; it was no good shutting one's eyes to the fact, at her age she'd look a perfect fool being divorced on account of a boy of three-and-twenty. Of course she wouldn't be such a fool as to marry Tom. Would Charles marry her? She turned and in the half-light looked at his distinguished profile. He had been madly in love with her for years; he was one of those chivalrous idiots that a woman could turn round her little finger; perhaps he wouldn't mind being co-respondent instead of Tom. That might be a very good way out. Lady Charles Tamerley. It sounded all right. Perhaps she had been a little imprudent. She had always been very careful when she went to Tom's flat, but it might be that one of the chauffeurs in the mews had seen her go in or come out and had thought things. That class of people had such filthy minds. As far as the night-clubs were concerned, she'd have been only too glad to go with Tom to quiet little places where no one would see them, but he didn't like that. He loved a crowd, he wanted to see smart people, and be seen. He liked to show her off.

“Damn,” she said to herself. “Damn, damn.”

Julia didn't enjoy her evening at the cinema as much as she had expected.





Chapter 18


Next day Julia got Dolly on her private number.

“Darling, it seems ages since I've seen you. What have you been doing with yourself all this time?”

“Nothing very much.”

Dolly's voice sounded cold.

“Now listen, Roger's coming home tomorrow. You know he's leaving Eton for good. I'm sending the car for him early and I want you to come to lunch. Not a party; only you and me, Michael and Roger.”

“I'm lunching out tomorrow.”

In twenty years Dolly had never been engaged when Julia wanted her to do something with her. The voice at the other end of the telephone was hostile.

“Dolly, how can you be so unkind? Roger'll be terribly disappointed. His first day at home; besides, I want to see you. I haven't seen you for ages and I miss you terribly. Can't you break your engagement, just for this once, darling, and we'll have a good old gossip after lunch, just you and me?”

No one could be more persuasive than Julia when she liked, no one could put more tenderness into her voice, nor a more irresistible appeal. There was a moment's pause and Julia knew that Dolly was struggling with her wounded feelings.

“All right, darling, I'll manage.”

“Darling.” But when she rang off Julia through clenched teeth muttered: “The old cow.”

Dolly came. Roger listened politely while she told him that he had grown and with his grave smile answered her suitably when she said the sort of things she thought proper to a boy of his age. Julia was puzzled by him. Without talking much he listened, apparently with attention, to what the rest of them were saying, but she had an odd feeling that he was occupied with thoughts of his own. He seemed to observe them with a detached curiosity like that with which he might have observed animals in a zoo. It was faintly disquieting. When the opportunity presented itself she delivered the little bit of dialogue she had prepared for Dolly's benefit.

“Oh, Roger darling, you know your wretched father's busy tonight. I've got a couple of seats for the second house at the Palladium and Tom wants you to dine with him at the Café Royal.”

“Oh!” He paused for a second. “All right.”

She turned to Dolly.

“It's so nice for Roger to have somebody like Tom to go about with. They're great friends, you know.”

Michael gave Dolly a glance. There was a twinkle in his eyes. He spoke.

“Tom's a very decent sort of boy. He won't let Roger get into any mischief.”

“I should have thought Roger would prefer to go about with his Eton friends,” said Dolly.

“Old cow,” thought Julia. “Old cow.”

But when lunch was over she asked her to come up to her room.

“I'll get into bed and you can talk to me while I'm resting. A good old girls' gossip, that's what I want.”

She put her arm affectionately round Dolly's vast waist and led her upstairs. For a while they spoke of indifferent things, clothes and servants, make-up and scandal; then Julia, leaning on her elbow, looked at Dolly with confiding eyes.

“Dolly, there's something I want to talk to you about. I want advice and you're the only person in the world whose advice I would take. I know I can trust you.”

“Of course, darling.”

“It appears that people are saying rather disagreeable things about me. Someone's been to Michael and told him that there's a lot of gossip about me and poor Tom Fennell.”

Though her eyes still wore the charming and appealing look that she knew Dolly found irresistible, she watched her closely for a start or for some change in her expression. She saw nothing.

“Who told Michael?”

“I don't know. He won't say. You know what he is when he starts being a perfect gentleman.”

She wondered if she only imagined that Dolly's features at this slightly relaxed.

“I want the truth, Dolly.”

“I'm so glad you've asked me, darling. You know how I hate to interfere in other people's business and if you hadn't brought the matter up yourself nothing would have induced me to mention it.”

“My dear, if I don't know that you're a loyal friend, who does?”

Dolly slipped off her shoes and settled down massively in her chair. Julia never took her eyes off her.

“You know how malicious people are. You've always led such a quiet, regular life. You've gone out so little, and then only with Michael or Charles Tamerley. He's different; of course everyone knows he's adored you for ages. It seems so funny that all of a sudden you should run around all over the place with a clerk in the firm that does your accounts.”

“He isn't exactly that. His father has bought him a share in the firm and he's a junior partner.”

“Yes, he gets four hundred a year.”

“How d'you know?” asked Julia quickly.

This time she was certain that Dolly was disconcerted.

“You persuaded me to go to his firm about my income tax. One of the head partners told me. It seems a little strange that on that he should be able to have a flat, dress the way he does and take people to night clubs.”

“For all I know his father may make him an allowance.”

“His father's a solicitor in the North of London. You know very well that if he's bought him a partnership he isn't making him an allowance as well.”

“Surely you don't imagine that I'm keeping him,” said Julia, with a ringing laugh.

“I don't imagine anything, darling. Other people do.”

Julia liked neither the words Dolly spoke nor the way she said them. But she gave no sign of her uneasiness.

“It's too absurd. He's Roger's friend much more than mine. Of course I've been about with him. I felt I was getting too set. I'm tired of just going to the theatre and taking care of myself. It's no life. After all if I don't enjoy myself a little now I never shall. I'm getting on, you know, Dolly, it's no good denying it. You know what Michael is; of course he's sweet, but he is a bore.”

“No more a bore than he's ever been,” said Dolly acidly.

“I should have thought I was the last person anyone would dream would have an affair with a boy twenty years younger than myself.”

“Twenty-five,” corrected Dolly. “I should have thought so too. Unfortunately he's not very discreet.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Well, he's told Avice Crichton that he'll get her a part in your next play.”

“Who the devil is Avice Crichton?”

“Oh, she's a young actress I know. She's as pretty as a picture.”

“He's only a silly kid. I suppose he thinks he can get round Michael. You know what Michael is with his little bits.”

“He says he can get you to do anything he wants. He says you just eat out of his hand.”

It was lucky for Julia that she was a good actress. For a second her heart stood still. How could he say a thing like that? The fool. The blasted fool. But recovering herself at once she laughed lightly.

“What nonsense! I don't believe a word of it.”

“He's a very commonplace, rather vulgar young man. It's not surprising if all the fuss you've made of him has turned his head.”

Julia, smiling good-naturedly, looked at her with ingenuous eyes.

“But, darling, you don't think he's my lover, do you?”

“If I don't, I'm the only person who doesn't.”

“And do you?”

For a minute Dolly did not answer. They looked at one another steadily, their hearts were black with hatred; but Julia still smiled.

“If you give me your solemn word of honour that he isn't, of course I'll believe you.”

Julia dropped her voice to a low, grave note. It had a true ring of sincerity:

“I've never told you a lie yet, Dolly, and I'm too old to begin now. I give you my solemn word of honour that Tom has never been anything more to me than just a friend.”

“You take a great weight off my mind.”

Julia knew that Dolly did not believe her and Dolly was aware that Julia knew it. She went on.

“But in that case, for your own sake, Julia dear, do be sensible. Don't go about with this young man any more. Drop him.”

“Oh, I couldn't do that. That would be an admission that people were right in what they thought. After all, my conscience is clear. I can afford to hold my head high. I should despise myself if I allowed my behaviour to be influenced by malicious gossip.”

Dolly slipped her feet back into he shoes and getting her lipstick out of her bag did her lips.

“Well, dear, you're old enough to know your own mind.”

They parted coldly.

But one or two of Dolly's remarks had been somewhat of a shock to Julia. They rankled. It was disconcerting that gossip had so nearly reached the truth. But did it matter? Plenty of women had lovers and who bothered? And an actress. No one expected an actress to be a pattern of propriety.

“It's my damned virtue. That's at the bottom of the trouble.”

She had acquired the reputation of a perfectly virtuous woman, whom the tongue of scandal could not touch, and now it looked as though her reputation was a prison that she had built round herself. But there was worse. What had Tom meant by saying that she ate out of his hand? That deeply affronted her. Silly little fool. How dare he? She didn't know what to do about it either. She would have liked to tax him with it. What was the good? He would deny it. The only thing was to say nothing; it had all gone too far now, she must accept everything. It was no good not facing the truth, he didn't love her, he was her lover because it gratified his self-esteem, because it brought him various things he cared for and because in his own eyes at least it gave him a sort of position.

“If I had any sense I'd chuck him.” She gave an angry laugh. “It's easy to say that. I love him.”

The strange thing was that when she looked into her heart it was not Julia Lambert the woman who resented the affront, she didn't care for herself, it was the affront to Julia Lambert the actress that stung her. She had often felt that her talent, genius the critics called it, but that was a very grand word, her gift, if you like, was not really herself, not even part of her, but something outside that used her, Julia Lambert the woman, in order to express itself. It was a strange, immaterial personality that seemed to descend upon her and it did things through her that she did not know she was capable of doing. She was an ordinary, prettyish, ageing woman. Her gift had neither age nor form. It was a spirit that played on her body as the violinist plays on his violin. It was the slight to that that galled her.

She tried to sleep. She was so accustomed to sleeping in the afternoon that she could always drop off the moment she composed herself, but on this occasion she turned restlessly from side to side and sleep would not come. At last she looked at the clock. Tom often got back from his office soon after five. She yearned for him; in his arms was peace, when she was with him nothing else mattered. She dialled his number.

“Hulloa? Yes. Who is it?”

She held the receiver to her ear, panic-stricken. It was Roger's voice. She hung up.





Chapter 19


Nor did Julia sleep well that night. She was awake when she heard Roger come in and, turning on her light she saw that it was four. She frowned. He came clattering down the stone stairs next morning just when she was beginning to think of getting up.

“Can I come in, Mummy?”

“Come in.”

He was still in his pyjamas and dressing-gown. She smiled at him because he looked so fresh and young.

“You were very late last night.”

“No, not very. I was in by one.”

“Liar. I looked at my clock. It was four.”

“All right. It was four then,” he agreed cheerfully.

“What on earth were you doing?”

“We went on to some place after the show and had supper. We danced.”

“Who with?”

“A couple of girls we picked up. Tom knew them before.”

“What were their names?”

“One was called Jill and one was called Joan. I don't know what their other names were. Joan's on the stage. She asked me if I couldn't get her an understudy in your next play.”

At all events neither of them was Avice Crichton. That name had been in her thoughts ever since Dolly had mentioned it.

“But those places aren't open till four.”

“No, we went back to Tom's flat. Tom made me promise I wouldn't tell you. He said you'd be furious.”

“Oh, my dear, it takes a great deal more than that to make me furious. I promise you I won't say a word.”

“If anyone's to blame I am. I went to see Tom yesterday afternoon and we arranged it then. All this stuff about love that one hears about in plays and reads in novels. I'm nearly eighteen. I thought I ought to see for myself what it was all about.”

Julia sat up in bed and looked at Roger with wide, enquiring eyes.

“Roger, what do you mean?”

He was composed and serious.

“Tom said he knew a couple of girls who were all right. He's had them both himself. They live together and so we phoned and asked them to meet us after the show. He told them I was a virgin and they'd better toss up for me. When we got back to the flat he took Jill into the bedroom and left me the sitting-room and Joan.”

For the moment she did not think of Tom, she was so disturbed at what Roger was saying.

“I don't think it's so much really. I don't see it's anything to make all that fuss about.”

She could not speak. The tears filled her eyes and ran quickly down her face.

“Mummy, what's the matter? Why are you crying?”

“But you're a little boy.”

He came over to her and sitting on the side of her bed took her in his arms.

“Darling, don't cry. I wouldn't have told you if I'd thought it was going to upset you. After all it had to happen sooner or later.”

“But so soon. So soon. It makes me feel so old.”

“Not you, darling. ‘Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.’”

She giggled through her tears.

“You fool, Roger, d'you think Cleopatra would have liked what that silly old donkey said of her? You might have waited a little longer.”

“It's just as well I didn't. I know all about it now. To tell you the truth I think it's rather disgusting.”

She sighed deeply. It was a comfort to feel him holding her so tenderly. But she felt terribly sorry for herself.

“You're not angry with me, darling?” he asked.

“Angry? No. But if it had to come I wish it hadn't been quite so matter of fact. You talk as though it had just been a rather curious experiment.”

“I suppose it was in a way.”

She gave him a little smile.

“And you really think that was love?”

“Well, it's what most people mean by it, isn't it?”

“No, they don't, they mean pain and anguish, shame, ecstasy, heaven and hell; they mean the sense of living more intensely, and unutterable boredom; they mean freedom and slavery; they mean peace and unrest.”

Something in the stillness with which he listened to her made her give him a glance through her eyelashes. There was a curious expression in his eyes. She did not know what it meant. It was as though he were gravely listening to a sound that came from a long way off.

“It doesn't sound as though it were much fun,” he murmured.

She took his smooth face in her hands and kissed his lips.

“I'm a fool, aren't I? You see, I still see you as a little baby boy that I'm holding in my arms.”

A twinkle shone in his eyes.

“What are you grinning at, you ape?”

“It made a damned good photograph, didn't it?”

She could not but laugh.

“You pig. You filthy pig.”

“I say, about the understudy, is there any chance for Joan?”

“Tell her to come and see me one day.”

But when Roger left her she sighed. She was depressed. She felt very lonely. Her life had always been so full and so exciting that she had never had the time to busy herself much with Roger. She got in a state, of course, when he had whooping-cough or measles, but he was for the most part in robust health, and then he occupied a pleasant place in the background of her consciousness. But she had always felt that he was there to be attended to when she was inclined and she had often thought it would be nice when he was old enough really to share her interests. It came to her as a shock now to realize that, without ever having really possessed him, she had lost him. Her lips tightened when she thought of the girl who had taken him from her.

“An understudy. My foot.”

Her pain absorbed her so that she could not feel the grief she might have felt from her discovery of Tom's perfidy. She had always known in her bones that he was unfaithful to her. At his age, with his wanton temperament, with herself tied down by her performances at the theatre, by all manner of engagements which her position forced upon her, it was plain that he had ample opportunity to gratify his inclinations. She had shut her eyes. All she asked was that she should not know. This was the first time that an actual fact had been thrust upon her notice.

“I must just put up with it,” she sighed. Thoughts wandered through her mind. “It's like lying and not knowing you're lying, that's what's fatal; I suppose it's better to be a fool and know it than a fool and not know it.”





Chapter 20


Tom went to Eastbourne with his family for Christmas. Julia had two performances on Boxing Day, so the Gosselyns stayed in town; they went to a large party at the Savoy that Dolly de Vries gave to see the New Year in; and a few days later Roger set off for Vienna. While he was in London Julia saw little of Tom. She did not ask Roger what they did when they tore about the town together, she did not want to know, she steeled herself not to think and distracted her mind by going to as many parties as she could. And there was always her acting; when once she got into the theatre her anguish, her humiliation, her jealousy were allayed. It gave her a sense of triumphant power to find, as it were in her pot of grease paint, another personality that could be touched by no human griefs. With that refuge always at hand she could support anything.

On the day that Roger left, Tom rang her up from his office.

“Are you doing anything tonight? What about going out on the binge?”

“No, I'm busy.”

It was not true, but the words slipped out of her mouth independent of her will.

“Oh, are you? Well, what about tomorrow?”

If he had expressed disappointment, if he had asked her to cut the date he supposed she had, she might have had strength to break with him then and there. His casualness defeated her.

“Tomorrow's all right.”

“O.K. I'll fetch you at the theatre after the show. Bye-bye.”

Julia was ready and waiting when he was shown into her dressing-room. She was strangely nervous. His face lit up when he saw her, and when Evie went out of the room for a moment he caught her in his arms and warmly kissed her on the lips.

“I feel all the better for that,” he laughed.

You would never have thought to look at him, so young, fresh and ingenuous, in such high spirits, that he was capable of giving her so much pain. You would never have thought that he was so deceitful. It was quite plain that he had not noticed that for more than a fortnight he had hardly seen her.

(“Oh, God, if I could only tell him to go to hell.”)

But she looked at him with a gay smile in her lovely eyes.

“Where are we going?”

“I've got a table at Quag's. They've got a new turn there, an American conjurer, who's grand.”

She talked with vivacity all through supper. She told him about the various parties she had been to, and the theatrical functions she had not been able to get out of, so that it seemed only on account of her engagements that they had not met. It disconcerted her to perceive that he took it as perfectly natural. He was glad to see her, that was plain, he was interested in what she had been doing and in the people she had seen, but it was plain also that he had not missed her. To see what he would say she told him that she had had an offer to take the play in which she was acting to New York. She told him the terms that had been suggested.

“They're marvellous,” he said, his eyes glittering. “What a snip! You can't lose and you may make a packet.”

“The only thing is, I don't much care for leaving London.”

“Why on earth not? I should have thought you'd jump at it. The play's had a good long run, for all you know it'll be pretty well through by Easter, and if you want to make a stab at America you couldn't have a better vehicle.”

“I don't see why it shouldn't run through the summer. Besides, I don't like strangers very much. I'm fond of my friends.”

“I think that's silly. Your friends'll get along without you all right. And you'll have a grand time in New York.”

Her gay laugh was very convincing.

“One would think you were terribly anxious to get rid of me.”

“Of course I should miss you like hell. But it would only be for a few months. If I had a chance like that I'd jump at it.”

But when they had finished supper and the commissionaire had called up a taxi for them he gave the address of the flat as if it were an understood thing that they should go back to it. In the taxi he put his arm round her waist and kissed her, and later, when she lay in his arms, in the little single bed, she felt that all the pain she had suffered during that last fortnight was not too great a price to pay for the happy peace that filled her heart.

Julia continued to go to the smart supper places and to nightclubs with Tom. If people wanted to think he was her lover, let them; she was past caring. But it happened more than once that he was engaged when she wanted him to go somewhere with her. It had spread around among Julia's grander friends that Tom was very clever at helping one with one's income-tax returns. The Dennorants had asked him down to the country for a weekend, and here he had met a number of persons who were glad to take advantage of his technical knowledge. He began to get invitations from people whom Julia did not know. Acquaintances would mention him to her.

“You know Tom Fennell, don't you? He's very clever, isn't he? I hear he's saved the Gillians hundreds of pounds on their income-tax.”

Julia was none too pleased. It was through her that he had got asked to parties that he wanted to go to. It began to look as if in this respect he could do without her. He was pleasant and unassuming, very well-dressed now, and with a fresh, clean look that was engaging; he was able to save people money; Julia knew the world which he was so anxious to get into well enough to realize that he would soon establish himself in it. She had no very high opinion of the morals of the women he would meet there and she could name more than one person of title who would be glad to snap him up. Julia's comfort was that they were all as mean as cat's meat. Dolly had said he was only earning four hundred a year; he certainly couldn't live in those circles on that.

Julia had with decision turned down the American offer before ever she mentioned it to Tom; their play was playing to very good business. But one of those inexplicable slumps that occasionally affect the theatre now swept over London and the takings suddenly dropped. It looked as though they would not be able to carry on long after Easter. They had a new play on which they set great hopes. It was called Nowadays, and the intention had been to produce it early in the autumn. It had a great part for Julia and the advantage of one that well suited Michael. It was the sort of play that might easily run a year. Michael did not much like the idea of producing it in May, with the summer coming on, but there seemed no help for it and he began looking about for a cast.

One afternoon, during the interval at a matinée, Evie brought a note in to Julia. She was surprised to see Roger's handwriting.

DEAR MOTHER,

This is to introduce to you Miss Joan Denver who Italked to you about. She's awfully keen on getting in theSiddons Theatre and would be quite satisfied with anunderstudy however small.

Your affectionate son,

ROGER.

Julia smiled at the formal way in which he wrote; she was tickled because he was so grown up as to try to get jobs for his girl friends. Then she suddenly remembered who Joan Denver was. Joan and Jill. She was the girl who had seduced poor Roger. Her face went grim. But she was curious to see her.

“Is George there?” George was the doorkeeper. Evie nodded and opened the door.

“George.”

He came in.

“Is the lady who brought this letter here now?”

“Yes, miss.”

“Tell her I'll see her after the play.”

She wore in the last act an evening dress with a train; it was a very grand dress and showed her beautiful figure to advantage. She wore diamonds in her dark hair and diamond bracelets on her arms. She looked, as indeed the part required, majestic. She received Joan Denver the moment she had taken her last call. Julia could in the twinkling of an eye leap from her part into private life, but now without an effort she continued to play the imperious, aloof, stately and well-bred woman of the play.

“I've kept you waiting so long I thought I wouldn't keep you till I'd got changed.”

Her cordial smile was the smile of a queen; her graciousness kept you at a respectful distance. In a glance she had taken in the young girl who entered her dressing-room. She was young, with a pretty little face and a snub nose, a good deal made-up and not very well made-up.

“Her legs are too short,” thought Julia. “Very second-rate.”

She had evidently put on her best clothes and the same glance had told Julia all about them.

(“Shaftesbury Avenue. Off the rail.”)

The poor thing was at the moment frightfully nervous. Julia made her sit down and offered her a cigarette.

“There are matches by your side.”

She saw her hands tremble when she tried to strike one. It broke and she rubbed a second three times against the box before she could get it to light.

(“If Roger could only see her now! Cheap rouge, cheap lipstick, and scared out of her wits. Gay little thing, he thought she was.”)

“Have you been on the stage long, Miss—I'm so sorry I've forgotten your name.”

“Joan Denver.” Her throat was dry and she could hardly speak. Her cigarette went out and she held it helplessly. She answered Julia's question. “Two years.”

“How old are you?”

“Nineteen.”

(“That's a lie. You're twenty-two if you're a day.”) “You know my son, don't you?”

“Yes.”

“He's just left Eton. He's gone to Vienna to learn German. Of course he's very young, but his father and I thought it would be good for him to spend a few months abroad before going up to Cambridge. And what parts have you played? Your cigarette's gone out. Won't you have another?”

“Oh, it's all right, thanks. I've been playing on tour. But I'm frightfully anxious to be in town.” Despair gave her courage and she uttered the speech she had evidently prepared. “I've got the most tremendous admiration for you, Miss Lambert. I always say you're the greatest actress on the stage. I've learnt more from you than I did all the years I was at the R.A.D.A. My greatest ambition is to be in your theatre, Miss Lambert, and if you could see your way to giving me a little something, I know it would be the most wonderful chance a girl could have.”

“Will you take off your hat?”

Joan Denver took the cheap little hat off her head and with a quick gesture shook out her close-cropped curls.

“What pretty hair you have,” said Julia.

Still with that slightly imperious, but infinitely cordial smile, the smile that a queen in royal procession bestows on her subjects, Julia gazed at her. She did not speak. She remembered Jane Taitbout's maxim: don't pause unless it's necessary, but then pause as long as you can. She could almost hear the girl's heart beating and she felt her shrinking in her ready-made clothes, shrinking in her skin.

“What made you think of asking my son to give you a letter to me?”

Joan grew red under her make-up and she swallowed before she answered.

“I met him at a friend's house and I told him how much I admired you and he said he thought perhaps you'd have something for me in your next play.”

“I'm just turning over the parts in my mind.”

“I wasn't thinking of a part. If I could have an understudy—I mean, that would give me a chance of attending rehearsals and studying your technique. That's an education in itself. Everyone agrees about that.”

(“Silly little fool, trying to flatter me. As if I didn't know that. And why the hell should I educate her?”) “It's very sweet of you to put it like that. I'm only a very ordinary person really. The public is so kind, so very kind. You're a pretty little thing. And young. Youth is so beautiful. Our policy has always been to give the younger people a chance. After all we can't go on for ever, and we look upon it as a duty we owe the public to train up actors and actresses to take our place when the time comes.”

Julia said these words so simply, in her beautifully modulated voice, that Joan Denver's heart was warmed. She'd got round the old girl and the understudy was as good as hers. Tom Fennell had said that if she played her cards well with Roger it might easily lead to something.

“Oh, that won't be for a long while yet, Miss Lambert,” she said, her eyes, her pretty dark eyes, glowing.

(“You're right there, my girl, dead right. I bet I could play you off the stage when I was seventy.”)

“I must think it over. I hardly know yet what understudies we shall want in our next play.”

“I hear there's some talk of Avice Crichton for the girl's part. I thought perhaps I could understudy her.”

Avice Crichton. No flicker of the eyes showed that the name meant anything to Julia.

“My husband has mentioned her, but nothing is settled yet. I don't know her at all. Is she clever?”

“I think so. I was at the Academy with her.”

“And pretty as a picture, they tell me.” Rising to her feet to show that the audience was at an end, Julia put off her royalty. She changed her tone and became on a sudden the jolly, good-natured actress who would do a good turn to anyone if she could. “Well, dear, leave me your name and address and if there's anything doing I'll let you know.”

“You won't forget me, Miss Lambert?”

“No, dear, I promise you I won't. It's been so nice to see you. You have a very sweet personality. You'll find your way out, won't you? Good-bye.”

“A fat chance she's got of ever setting foot in this theatre,” said Julia to herself when she was gone. “Dirty little bitch to seduce my son. Poor lamb. It's a shame, that's what it is; women like that oughtn't to be allowed.”

She looked at herself in the glass as she slipped out of her beautiful gown. Her eyes were hard and her lips had a sardonic curl. She addressed her reflection.

“And I may tell you this, old girl: there's one person who isn't going to play in Nowadays and that's Miss Avice Crichton.”





Chapter 21


But a week or so later Michael mentioned her.

“I say, have you ever heard of a girl called Avice Crichton?”

“Never.”

“I'm told she's rather good. A lady and all that sort of thing. Her father's in the army. I was wondering if she'd do for Honor.”

“How did you hear about her?”

“Through Tom. He knows her, he says she's clever. She's playing in a Sunday-night show. Next Sunday, in point of fact. He says he thinks it might be worth while to go and have a look-see.”

“Well, why don't you?”

“I was going down to Sandwich to play golf. Would it bore you awfully to go? I expect the play's rotten, but you'd be able to tell if it was worth while letting her read the part. Tom'll go with you.”

Julia's heart was beating nineteen to the dozen.

“Of course I'll go.”

She phoned to Tom and asked him to come round and have a snack before they went to the theatre. He arrived before she was ready.

“Am I late or were you early?” she said, when she came into the drawing-room.

She saw that he had been waiting impatiently. He was nervous and eager.

“They're going to ring up sharp at eight,” he said. “I hate getting to a play after it's begun.”

His agitation told her all she wanted to know. She lingered a little over the cocktails.

“What is the name of this actress we're going to see tonight?” she asked.

“Avice Crichton. I'm awfully anxious to know what you think about her. I think she's a find. She knows you're coming tonight. She's frightfully nervous, but I told her she needn't be. You know what these Sunday-night plays are; scratch rehearsals and all that; I said you'd quite understand and you'd make allowances.”

All through dinner he kept looking at his watch. Julia acted the woman of the world. She talked of one thing and another and noticed that he listened with distraction. As soon as he could he brought the conversation back to Avice Crichton.

“Of course I haven't said anything to her about it, but I believe she'd be all right for Honor.” He had read Nowadays, as he read, before they were produced, all Julia's plays. “She looks the part all right, I'm sure of that. She's had a struggle and of course it would be a wonderful chance for her. She admires you tremendously and she's terribly anxious to get into a play with you.”

“That's understandable. It means the chance of a year's run and a lot of managers seeing her.”

“She's the right colour, she's very fair; she'd be a good contrast to you.”

“What with platinum and peroxide there's no lack of blondes on the stage.”

“But hers is natural.”

“Is it? I had a long letter from Roger this morning. He seems to be having quite a good time in Vienna.”

Tom's interest subsided. He looked at his watch. When the coffee came Julia said it was undrinkable. She said she must have some more made.

“Oh, Julia, it isn't worth while. We shall be awfully late.”

“I don't suppose it matters if we miss the first few minutes.”

His voice was anguished.

“I promised we wouldn't be late. She's got a very good scene almost at the beginning.”

“I'm sorry, but I can't go without my coffee.”

While they waited for it she maintained a bright flow of conversation. He scarcely answered. He looked anxiously at the door. And when the coffee came she drank it with maddening deliberation. By the time they got in the car he was in a state of cold fury and he stared silently in front of him with a sulky pout on his mouth. Julia was not dissatisfied with herself. They reached the theatre two minutes before the curtain rose and as Julia appeared there was a burst of clapping from the audience. Julia, apologizing to the people she disturbed, threaded her way to her seat in the middle of the stalls. Her faint smile acknowledged the applause that greeted her beautifully-timed entrance, but her downcast eyes modestly disclaimed that it could have any connection with her.

The curtain went up and after a short scene two girls came in, one very pretty and young, the other much older and plain. In a minute Julia turned to Tom and whispered:

“Which is Avice Crichton, the young one or the old one?”

“The young one.”

“Oh, of course, you said she was fair, didn't you?”

She gave his face a glance. He had lost his sulky look; a happy smile played on his lips. Julia turned her attention to the stage. Avice Crichton was very pretty, no one could deny that, with lovely golden hair, fine blue eyes and a little straight nose; but it was a type that Julia did not care for.

“Insipid,” she said to herself. “Chorus-girly.”

She watched her performance for a few minutes. She watched intently; then she leant back in her stall with a little sigh.

“She can't act for toffee,” she decided.

When the curtain fell Tom turned to her eagerly. He had completely got over his bad temper.

“What do you think of her?”

“She's as pretty as a picture.”

“I know that. But her acting. Don't you think she's good?”

“Yes, clever.”

“I wish you'd come round and tell her that yourself. It would buck her up tremendously.”

“I?”

He did not realize what he was asking her to do. It was unheard-of that she, Julia Lambert, should go behind and congratulate a small-part actress.

“I promised I'd take you round after the second act. Be a sport, Julia. It'll please her so much.”

(“The fool. The blasted fool. All right, I'll go through with it.”) “Of course if you think it'll mean anything to her, I'll come with pleasure.”

After the second act they went through the iron door and Tom led her to Avice Crichton's dressing-room. She was sharing it with the plain girl with whom she had made her first entrance. Tom effected the introductions. She held out a limp hand in a slightly affected manner.

“I'm so glad to meet you, Miss Lambert. Excuse this dressing-room, won't you? But it was no good trying to make it look nice just for one night.”

She was not in the least nervous. Indeed, she seemed self-assured.

(“Hard as nails. And with an eye to the main chance. Doing the colonel's daughter on me.”)

“It's awfully nice of you to come round. I'm afraid it's not much of a play, but when one's starting like I am one has to put up with what one can get. I was rather doubtful about it when they sent it me to read, but I took a fancy to the part.”

“You play it charmingly,” said Julia.

“It's awfully nice of you to say so. I wish we could have had a few more rehearsals. I particularly wanted to show you what I could do.”

“Well, you know, I've been connected with the profession a good many years. I always think, if one has talent one can't help showing it. Don't you?”

“I know what you mean. Of course I want a lot more experience, I know that, but it's only a chance I want really. I know I can act. If I could only get a part that I could really get my teeth into.”

She waited a little in order to let Julia say that she had in her new play just the part that would suit her, but Julia continued to look at her smilingly. Julia was grimly amused to find herself treated like a curate's wife to whom the squire's lady was being very kind.

“Have you been on the stage long?” she said at last. “It seems funny I should never have heard of you.”

“Well, I was in revue for a while, but I felt I was just wasting my time. I was out on tour all last season. I don't want to leave London again if I can help it.”

“The profession's terribly overcrowded,” said Julia.

“Oh, I know. It seems almost hopeless unless you've got influence or something. I hear you're putting a new play on soon.”

“Yes.”

Julia continued to smile with an almost intolerable sweetness.

“If there's a part for me in it, I'd most awfully like to play with you. I'm so sorry Mr. Gosselyn couldn't come tonight.”

“I'll tell him about you.”

“D'you really think there's a chance for me?” Through her self-assurance, through the country-house manner she assumed in order to impress Julia, there pierced an anxious eagerness. “If you'd put in a word for me it would help so much.”

Julia gave her a reflective look.

“I take my husband's advice more often than he takes mine,” she smiled.

When they left the dressing-room so that Avice Crichton might change for the third act, Julia caught the questioning glance she gave Tom as she said good-bye to him. Julia was conscious, though she saw no movement, that he slightly shook his head. Her sensibility at that moment was extraordinarily acute and she translated the mute dialogue into words.

“Coming to supper afterwards?”

“No, damn it, I can't, I've got to see her home.”

Julia listened to the third act grimly. That was in order since the play was serious. When it was over and a pale, shattered author had made a halting speech, Tom asked her where she would like to go for supper.

“Let's go home and talk,” she said. “If you're hungry I'm sure we can find you something to eat in the kitchen.”

“D'you mean to Stanhope Place?”

“Yes.”

“All right.”

She felt his relief that she did not want to go back to the flat. He was silent in the car and she knew that it irked him to have to come back with her. She guessed that someone was giving a supper party to which Avice Crichton was going and he wanted to be there. The house was dark and empty when they reached it. The servants were in bed. Julia suggested that they should go down to the basement and forage.

“I don't want anything to eat unless you do,” he said. “I'll just have a whisky and soda and go to bed. I've got a very heavy day tomorrow at the office.”

“All right. Bring it up to the drawing-room. I'll go and turn on the lights.”

When he came up she was doing her face in front of a mirror and she continued till he had poured out the whisky and sat down. Then she turned round. He looked very young, and incredibly charming, in his beautiful clothes, sitting there in the big armchair, and all the bitterness she had felt that evening, all the devouring jealousy of the last few days, were dissipated on a sudden by the intensity of her passion. She sat down on the arm of his chair and caressingly passed her hand over his hair. He drew back with an angry gesture.

“Don't do that,” he said. “I do hate having my hair mussed about.”

It was like a knife in her heart. He had never spoken to her in that tone before. But she laughed lightly and getting up took the whisky he had poured out for her and sat down in a chair opposite him. The movement he had made, the words he had spoken, were instinctive and he was a trifle abashed. He avoided her glance and his face once more bore a sulky look. The moment was decisive. For a while they were silent. Julia's heart beat painfully, but at last she forced herself to speak.

“Tell me,” she said, smiling, “have you been to bed with Avice Crichton?”

“Of course not,” he cried.

“Why not? She's pretty.”

“She's not that sort of girl. I respect her.”

Julia let none of her feelings appear on her face. Her manner was wonderfully casual; she might have been talking of the fall of empires or the death of kings.

“D'you know what I should have said? I should have said you were madly in love with her.” He still avoided her eyes. “Are you engaged to her by anychance?”

“No.”

He looked at her now, but the eyes that met Julia's were hostile.

“Have you asked her to marry you?”

“How could I? A damned rotter like me.”

He spoke so passionately that Julia was astonished.

“What are you talking about?”

“Oh, what's the good of beating about the bush? How could I ask a decent girl to marry me? I'm nothing but a kept boy, and, God knows, you have good reason to know it.”

“Don't be so silly. What a fuss to make over a few little presents I've given you.”

“I oughtn't to have taken them. I knew all the time it was wrong. It all came so gradually that I didn't realize what was happening till I was in it up to my neck. I couldn't afford to lead the life you made me lead; I was absolutely up against it. I had to take money from you.”

“Why not? After all, I'm a very rich woman.”

“Damn your money.”

He was holding a glass in his hands and yielding to a sudden impulse, he flung it into the fireplace. It shattered.

“You needn't break up the happy home,” said Julia ironically.

“I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.” He sank back into his chair and turned his head away. “I'm so ashamed of myself. It's not very nice to have lost one's self-respect.”

Julia hesitated. She did not quite know what to say.

“It seemed only natural to help you when you were in a hole. It was a pleasure to me.”

“I know, you were wonderfully tactful about it. You almost persuaded me that I was doing you a service when you paid my debts. You made it easy for me to behave like a cad.”

“I'm sorry you should feel like that about it.”

She spoke rather tartly. She was beginning to feel a trifle irritated.

“There's nothing for you to be sorry about. You wanted me and you bought me. If I was such a skunk as to let myself be bought that was no business of yours.”

“How long have you been feeling like this?”

“From the beginning.”

“That isn't true.”

She knew that what had awakened his conscience was the love that had seized him for a girl who he believed was pure. The poor fool! Didn't he know that Avice Crichton would go to bed with an assistant stage manager if she thought it would get her a part?

“If you're in love with Avice Crichton why don't you tell me so?” He looked at her miserably, but did not answer. “Are you afraid it'll crab her chances of getting a part in the new play? You ought to know me well enough by now to know that I would never let sentiment interfere with business.”

He could hardly believe his ears.

“What do you mean by that?”

“I think she's rather a find. I'm going to tell Michael that I think she'll do very well.”

“Oh, Julia, you are a brick. I never knew what a wonderful woman you were.”

“You should have asked me and I'd have told you.”

He gave a sigh of relief.

“My dear, I'm so terribly fond of you.”

“I know, and I'm terribly fond of you. You're great fun to go about with and you're always so well turned out, you're a credit to any woman. I've liked going to bed with you and I've a sort of notion you've liked going to bed with me. But let's face it, I've never been in love with you any more than you've been in love with me. I knew it couldn't last. Sooner or later you were bound to fall in love and that would end it. And you have fallen in love, haven't you?”

“Yes.”

She was determined to make him say it, but when he did the pang it gave her was dreadful. Notwithstanding, she smiled goodhumouredly. “We've had some very jolly times together, but don't you think the moment has come to call it a day?”

She spoke so naturally, almost jestingly, that no one could have guessed that the pain at her heart seemed past bearing. She waited for her answer with sickening dread.

“I'm awfully sorry, Julia; I must regain my self-respect.” He looked at her with troubled eyes. “You aren't angry with me?”

“Because you've transferred your volatile affections from me to Avice Crichton?” Her eyes danced with mischievous laughter. “My dear, of course not. After all they stay in the profession.”

“I'm very grateful to you for all you've done for me. I don't want you to think I'm not.”

“Oh, my pet, don't talk such nonsense. I've done nothing for you.” She got up. “Now you really must go. You've got a heavy day at the office tomorrow and I'm dog-tired.”

It was a load off his mind. But he wasn't quite happy for all that, he was puzzled by her tone, which was so friendly and yet at the same time faintly ironical; he felt a trifle let down. He went up to her to kiss her good-night. She hesitated for the fraction of a second, then with a friendly smile gave him first one cheek and then the other.

“You'll find your way out, won't you?” She put her hand to her mouth to hide an elaborate yawn. “Oh, I'm so sleepy.”

The moment he had gone she turned out the lights and went to the window. She peered cautiously through the curtains. She heard him slam the front door and saw him come out. He looked right and left. She guessed at once that he was looking for a taxi. There was none in sight and he started to walk in the direction of the Park. She knew that he was going to join Avice Crichton at the supper party and tell her the glad news. Julia sank into a chair. She had acted, she had acted marvellously, and now she felt all in. Tears, tears that nobody could see, rolled down her cheeks. She was miserably unhappy. There was only one thing that enabled her to bear her wretchedness, and that was the icy contempt that she could not but feel for the silly boy who could prefer to her a small-part actress who didn't even begin to know how to act. It was grotesque. She couldn't use her hands; why, she didn't even know how to walk across the stage.

“If I had any sense of humour I'd just laugh my head off,” she cried. “It's the most priceless joke I've ever heard.”

She wondered what Tom would do now. The rent of the flat would be falling due on quarter day. A lot of the things in it belonged to her. He wouldn't much like going back to his bed-sitting-room in Tavistock Square. She thought of the friends he had made through her. He'd been clever with them. They found him useful and he'd keep them. But it wouldn't be so easy for him to take Avice about. She was a hard, mercenary little thing, Julia was sure of that, she wouldn'tbe much inclined to bother about him when his money flowed less freely. The fool to be taken in by her pretence of virtue! Julia knew the type. It was quite obvious, she was only using Tom to get a part at the Siddons and the moment she got it she would give him the air. Julia started when this notion crossed her mind. She had promised Tom that Avice should have the part in Nowadays because it fell into the scene she was playing, but she had attached no importance to her promise. Michael was always there to put his foot down.

“By God, she shall have the part,” she said out loud. She chuckled maliciously. “Heaven knows, I'm a good-natured woman, but there are limits to everything.”

It would be a satisfaction to turn the tables on Tom and Avice Crichton. She sat on, in the darkness, grimly thinking how she would do it. But every now and then she started to cry again, for from the depths of her subconscious surged up recollections that were horribly painful. Recollections of Tom's slim, youthful body against hers, his warm nakedness and the peculiar feel of his lips, his smile, at once shy and roguish, and the smell of his curly hair.

“If I hadn't been a fool I'd have said nothing. I ought to know him by now. It's only an infatuation. He'd have got over it and then he'd have come hungrily back to me.”

Now she was nearly dead with fatigue. She got up and went to bed. She took a sleeping-draught.





Chapter 22


But she woke early next morning, at six, and began to think of Tom. She repeated to herself all she had said to him and all he had said to her. She was harassed and unhappy. Her only consolation was that she had carried the rupture through with so careless a gaiety that he could not guess how miserable he had made her.

She spent a wretched day, unable to think of anything else, and angry with herself because she could not put Tom out of her mind. It would not have been so bad if she could have confided her grief to a friend. She wanted someone to console her, someone to tell her that Tom was not worth troubling about and to assure her that he had treated her shamefully. As a rule she took her troubles to Charles or to Dolly. Of course Charles would give her all the sympathy she needed, but it would be a terrible blow to him, after all he had loved her to distraction for twenty years, and it would be cruel to tell him that she had given to a very ordinary young man what he would gladly have sacrificed ten years of his life for. She was his ideal and it would be heartless on her part to shatter it. It certainly did her good at that moment to be assured that Charles Tamerley, so distinguished, so cultured, so elegant, loved her with an imperishable devotion. Of course Dolly would be delighted if she confided in her. They had not seen much of one another lately, but Julia knew that she had only to call up and Dolly would come running. Even though she more than suspected the truth already she'd be shocked and jealous when Julia made a clean breast of it, but she'd be so thankful that everything was over, she'd forgive. It would be a comfort to both of them to tear Tom limb from limb. Of course it wouldn't be very nice to admit that Tom had chucked her, and Dolly was so shrewd, she would never get away with the lie that she had chucked him. She wanted to have a good cry with somebody, and there didn't seem to be any reason for it if she had made the break herself. It would be a score for Dolly, and however sympathetic she was it was asking too much of human nature to expect that she would be altogether sorry that Julia had been taken down a peg or two. Dolly had always worshipped her. She wasn't going to give her a peep at her feet of clay.

“It almost looks as if the only person I can go to is Michael,” she giggled. “But I suppose it wouldn't do.”

She knew exactly what he would say.

“My dear girl, I'm really not the sort of feller you ought to come to with a story like that. Damn it all, you put me in a very awkward position. I flatter myself I'm pretty broad-minded, I may be an actor, but when all's said and done I am a gentleman, and well, I mean, I mean it's such damned bad form.”

Michael did not get home till the afternoon, and when he came into her room she was resting. He told her about his weekend and the result of his matches. He had played very well, some of his recoveries had been marvellous, and he described them in detail.

“By the way, what about that girl you saw last night, is she any good?”

“I really think she is, you know. She's very pretty. You're sure to fall for her.”

“Oh, my dear, at my time of life. Can she act?”

“She's inexperienced of course, but I think she's got it in her.”

“Oh, well, I'd better have her up and give her the once-over. How can I get hold of her?”

“Tom's got her address.”

“I'll phone him right away.”

He took off the receiver and dialled Tom's number. Tom was in and Michael wrote down the address on a pad.

The conversation went on.

“Oh, my dear old chap, I'm sorry to hear that. What rotten luck!”

“What's the matter?” asked Julia.

He motioned her to be quiet.

“Oh, well, I don't want to be hard on you. Don't you worry. I'm sure we can come to some arrangement that will be satisfactory to you.” He put his hand over the receiver and turned to Julia. “Shall I ask him to dinner next Sunday?”

“If you like.”

“Julia says, will you come and dine on Sunday? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, so long, old man.”

He put down the receiver.

“He's got a date. Is the young ruffian having an affair with this girl?”

“He assures me not. He respects her. She's a colonel's daughter.”

“Oh, she's a lady.”

“I don't know that that follows,” said Julia acidly. “What were you talking to him about?”

“He says they've cut his salary. Bad times. He wants to give up the flat.” Julia's heart gave a sudden sickening beat. “I've told him not to worry. I'll let him stay there rent free till times improve.”

“I don't know why you should do that. After all it was a purely business arrangement.”

“It seems rather tough luck on a young chap like that. And you know he's very useful to us; if we want an extra man we can always call upon him, and it's convenient having him round the corner when I want someone to play golf with me. It's only twenty-five pounds a quarter.”

“You're the last person I should expect to see indulge in indiscriminate generosity.”

“Oh, don't you be afraid, if I lose on the swings I'll get back on the roundabouts.”

The masseuse came in and put an end to the conversation. Julia was thankful that it would soon be time to go down to the theatre and so put an end for a while to the misery of that long day; when she got back she would take a sleeping-draught again and so get some hours of forgetfulness. She had a notion that in a few days the worst of her pain would be over; the important thing was to get through them as best she could. She must distract her mind. When she left for the theatre she told the butler to ring up Charles Tamerley and see if she could lunch with him at the Ritz next day.

He was extraordinarily nice at luncheon. His look, his manner, bespoke the different world he lived in, and she felt a sudden abhorrence for the circle in which on Tom's account she had moved during the last year. He spoke of politics, of art, of books; and peace entered into her soul. Tom had been an obsession and she saw now that it had been hurtful; but she would escape from it. Her spirits rose. She did not want to be alone, she knew that even though she went home after lunch she would not sleep, so she asked Charles if he would take her to the National Gallery. She could give him no greater pleasure; he liked to talk about pictures and he talked of them well. It took them back to the old days when she had made her first success in London and they used to spend so many afternoons together, walking in the park or sauntering through museums. The day after that she had a matnée and the next a lunch-party, but when they separated they arranged to lunch again together on the Friday and go to the Tate.

A few days later Michael told her that he had engaged Avice Crichton.

“She has the looks for the part, there's no doubt about that, and she'll be a good contrast to you. I'm taking her acting on the strength of what you said.”

Next morning they rang through from the basement to say that Mr. Fennell was on the telephone. It seemed to her that her heart stopped beating.

“Put him through.”

“Julia, I wanted to tell you, Michael has engaged Avice.”

“Yes, I know.”

“He told her he was engaging her on what you'd told him. You are a brick.”

Julia, her heart now beating nineteen to the dozen, made an effort to control her voice.

“Oh, don't talk such nonsense,” she answered gaily. “I told you it would be all right.”

“I'm awfully glad it's fixed up. She's accepted the part on what I've told her about it. Ordinarily she won't take anything unless she's read the play.”

It was just as well he could not see Julia's face when she heard him say this. She would have liked to answer tartly that it was not their habit when they engaged small-part actresses to let them read the play, but instead she said mildly:

“Well, I think she'll like it, don't you? It's quite a good part.”

“And you know, she'll play it for all it's worth. I believe she'll make a sensation.”

Julia took a long breath.

“It'll be wonderful, won't it? I mean, it may make her.”

“Yes, I've told her that. I say, when am I going to see you again?”

“I'll phone you, shall I? It's such a bore, I'm terribly full of engagements for the next few days.”

“You're not going to drop me just because…”

She gave a low, rather hoarse chuckle, that chuckle which so delighted audiences.

“Don't be so silly. Oh lord, there's my bath running. I must go and have it. Good-bye, my sweet.”

She put down the receiver. The sound of his voice! The pain in her heart was unendurable. Sitting up in her bed she rocked to and fro in an agony.

“What shall I do? What shall I do?”

She had thought she was getting over it, and now that brief, silly conversation had shown her that she loved him as much as ever. She wanted him. She missed him every minute of the day. She could not do without him.

“I shall never get over it,” she moaned.

Once again the theatre was her only refuge. By an ironic chance the great scene of the play in which she was then acting, the scene to which the play owed its success, showed the parting of two lovers. It was true that they parted from a sense of duty; and Julia, in the play, sacrificed her love, her hopes of happiness, all that she held dear, to an ideal of uprightness. It was a scene that had appealed to her from the beginning. She was wonderfully moving in it. She put into it now all the agony of her spirit; it was no longer the broken heart of a character that she portrayed but her own. In ordinary life she tried to stifle a passion that she knew very well was ridiculous, a love that was unworthy of the woman she was, and she steeled herself to think as little as possible of the wretched boy who had wrought such havoc with her; but when she came to this scene she let herself go. She gave free rein to her anguish. She was hopeless with her own loss, and the love she poured out on the man who was playing opposite to her was the love she still felt, the passionate, devouring love, for Tom. The prospect of the empty life that confronted the woman of the play was the prospect of her own empty life. There was at least that solace, she felt she had never played so magnificently.

“My God, it's almost worth while to suffer so frightfully to give such a performance.”

She had never put more of herself into a part.

One night a week or two later when she came into her dressing-room at the end of the play, exhausted by all the emotion she had displayed, but triumphant after innumerable curtain calls, she found Michael sitting there.

“Hulloa? You haven't been in front, have you?”

“Yes.”

“But you were in front two or three days ago.”

“Yes, I've sat through the play for the last four nights.”

She started to undress. He got up from his chair and began to walk up and down. She gave him a glance and saw that he was frowning slightly.

“What's the matter?”

“That's what I want to know.”

She gave a start. The thought flashed through her mind that he had once more heard something about Tom.

“Why the devil isn't Evie here?” she asked.

“I told her to get out. I've got something to say to you, Julia. It's no good your flying in a temper. You've just got to listen.”

A cold shiver ran down her spine.

“Well, what is it?”

“I heard something was up and I thought I'd better see for myself. At first I thought it was just an accident. That's why I didn't say anything till I was quite sure. What's wrong with you, Julia?”

“With me?”

“Yes. Why are you giving such a lousy performance?”

“Me?” That was the last thing she expected to hear him say. She faced him with blazing eyes. “You damned fool, I've never acted better in my life.”

“Nonsense. You're acting like hell.”

Of course it was a relief that he was talking about her acting, but what he was saying was so ridiculous that, angry as she was, she had to laugh.

“You blasted idiot, you don't know what you're talking about. Why, what I don't know about acting isn't worth knowing. Everything you know about it I've taught you. If you're even a tolerable actor, it's due to me. After all, the proof of the pudding's in the eating. D'you know how many curtain calls I got tonight? The play's never gone better in all its run.”

“I know all about that. The public are a lot of jackasses. If you yell and scream and throw yourself about you'll always get a lot of damned fools to shout themselves silly. Just barn-storming, that's what you've been doing the last four nights. It was false from beginning to end.”

“False? But I felt every word of it.”

“I don't care what you felt, you weren't acting it. Your performance was a mess. You were exaggerating; you were over-acting; you didn't carry conviction for a moment. It was about as rotten a piece of ham-acting as I've ever seen in my life.”

“You bloody swine, how dare you talk to me like that? It's you the ham.”

With her open hand she gave him a great swinging blow on the face. He smiled.

“You can hit me, you can swear at me, you can yell your head off, but the fact remains that your acting's gone all to hell. I'm not going to start rehearsing Nowadays with you acting like that.”

“Find someone who can act the part better than I can then.”

“Don't be silly, Julia. I may not be a very good actor myself, I never thought I was, but I know good acting from bad. And what's more there's nothing about you I don't know. I'm going to put up the notices on Saturday and then I want you to go abroad. We'll make Nowadays our autumn production.”

The quiet, decisive way in which he spoke calmed her. It was true that when it came to acting Michael knew everything there was to know about her.

“Is it true that I'm acting badly?”

“Rottenly.”

She thought it over. She knew exactly what had happened. She had let her emotion run away with her; she had been feeling, not acting. Again a cold shiver ran down her spine. This was serious. It was all very fine to have a broken heart, but if it was going to interfere with her acting…no, no, no. That was quite another pair of shoes. Her acting was more important than any love affair in the world.

“I'll try and pull myself together.”

“It's no good trying to force oneself. You're tired out. It's my fault, I ought to have insisted on your taking a holiday long ago. What you want is a good rest.”

“What about the theatre?”

“If I can't let it, I'll revive some play that I can play in. There's Hearts Are Trumps. You always hated your part in that.”

“Everyone says the season's going to be wonderful. You can't expect much of a revival, with me out of the cast; you won't make a penny.”

“I don't care a hang about that. The only thing that matters is your health.”

“Oh, Christ, don't be so magnanimous,” she cried. “I can't bear it.”

Suddenly she burst into a storm of weeping.

“Darling!”

He took her in his arms and sat her down on the sofa with himself beside her. She clung to him desperately.

“You're so good to me, Michael, and I hate myself. I'm a beast, I'm a slut, I'm just a bloody bitch. I'm rotten through and through.”

“All that may be,” he smiled, “but the fact remains that you're a very great actress.”

“I don't know how you can have the patience you have with me. I've treated you foully. You've been too wonderful and I've sacrificed you heartlessly.”

“Now, dear, don't say a lot of things that you'll regret later. I shall only bring them up against you another time.”

His tenderness melted her and she reproached herself bitterly because for years she had found him so boring.

“Thank God, I've got you. What should I do without you?”

“You haven't got to do without me.”

He held her close and though she sobbed still she began to feel comforted.

“I'm sorry I was so beastly to you just now.”

“Oh, my dear.”

“Do you really think I'm a ham actress?”

“Darling, Duse couldn't hold a candle to you.”

“Do you honestly think that? Give me your hanky. You never saw Sarah Bernhardt, did you?”

“No, never.”

“She ranted like the devil.”

They sat together for a little while, in silence, and Julia grew calmer in spirit. Her heart was filled with a great love for Michael.

“You're still the best-looking man in England,” she murmured at last. “No one will ever persuade me to the contrary.”

She felt that he drew in his belly and thrust out his chin, and it seemed to her rather sweet and touching.

“You're quite right. I'm tired out. I feel low and miserable. I feel all empty inside. The only thing is to go away.”





Chapter 23


After Julia had made up her mind to that she was glad. The prospect of getting away from the misery that tormented her at once made it easier to bear. The notices were put up; Michael collected his cast for the revival and started rehearsals. It amused Julia to sit idly in a stall and watch the actress who had been engaged rehearse the part which she had played herself. She had never lost the thrill it gave her when she first went on the stage to sit in the darkened playhouse, under dust-sheets, and see the characters grow in the actors' hands. Merely to be inside a theatre rested her; nowhere was she so happy. Watching the rehearsals she was able to relax so that when at night she had her own performance to give she felt fresh. She realized that all Michael had said was true. She took hold of herself. Thrusting her private emotion into the background and thus getting the character under control, she managed once more to play with her accustomed virtuosity. Her acting ceased to be a means by which she gave release to her feelings and was again the manifestation of her creative instinct. She got a quiet exhilaration out of thus recovering mastery over her medium. It gave her a sense of power and of liberation.

But the triumphant effort she made took it out of her and when she was not in the theatre she felt listless and discouraged. She lost her exuberant vitality. A new humility overcame her. She had a feeling that her day was done. She sighed as she told herself that nobody wanted her any more. Michael suggested that she should go to Vienna to be near Roger, and she would have liked that, but she shook her head.

“I should only cramp his style.”

She was afraid he would find her a bore. He was enjoying himself and she would only be in the way. She could not bear the thought that he would find it an irksome duty to take her here and there and occasionally have lunch or dinner with her. It was only natural that he should have more fun with the friends of his own age that he had made. She decided to go and stay with her mother. Mrs. Lambert—Madame de Lambert, as Michael insisted on calling her—had lived for many years now with her sister, Madame Falloux, at St. Malo. She spent a few days every year in London with Julia, but this year had not been well enough to come. She was an old lady, well over seventy, and Julia knew that it would be a great joy for her to have her daughter on a long visit. Who cared about an English actress in Vienna? She wouldn't be anyone there. In St. Malo she would be something of a figure, and it would be fun for the two old women to be able to show her off to their friends.

“Ma fille, la plus grande actrice d'Angleterre,” and all that sort of thing.

Poor old girls, they couldn't live much longer and they led drab, monotonous lives. Of course it would be fearfully boring for her, but it would be a treat for them. Julia had a feeling that perhaps in the course of her brilliant and triumphant career she had a trifle neglected her mother. She could make up for it now. She would lay herself out to be charming. Her tenderness for Michael and her everpresent sense of having been for years unjust to him filled her with contrition. She felt that she had been selfish and overbearing, and she wanted to atone for all that. She was eager to sacrifice herself, and so wrote to her mother to announce her imminent arrival.

She managed in the most natural way in the world to see nothing of Tom till her last day in London. The play had closed the night before and she was starting for St. Malo in the evening. Tom came in about six o'clock to say good-bye to her. Michael was there, Dolly, Charles Tamerley and one or two others, so that there was no chance of their being left even for a moment by themselves. Julia found no difficulty in talking to him naturally. To see him gave her not the anguish she had feared but no more than a dull heartache. They had kept the date and place of her departure secret, that is to say, the press representative of the theatre had only rung up a very few newspapers, so that when Julia and Michael reached the station there were not more than half-a-dozen reporters and three cameramen. Julia said a few gracious words to them, and Michael a few more, then the press representative took the reporters aside and gave them asuccinct account of Julia's plans. Meanwhile Julia and Michael posed while the cameramen to the glare of flashes photographed them arm in arm, exchanging a final kiss, and at last Julia, half out of the carriage window, giving her hand to Michael who stood on the platform.

“What a nuisance these people are,” she said. “One simply cannot escape them.”

“I can't imagine how they knew you were going.”

The little crowd that had assembled when they realized that something was going on stood at a respectful distance. The press representative came up and told Michael he thought he'd given the reporters enough for a column. The train steamed out.

Julia had refused to take Evie with her. She had a feeling that in order to regain her serenity she must cut herself off completely for a time from her old life. Evie in that French household would be out of place. For Madame Falloux, Julia's Aunt Carrie, married as a girl to a Frenchman, now as an old, old lady spoke French more easily than English. She had been a widow for many years and her only son had been killed in the war. She lived in a tall, narrow stone house on a hill, and when you crossed its threshold from the cobbled street you entered upon the peace of a by-gone age. Nothing had been changed for half a century. The drawing-room was furnished with a Louis XV suite under covers, and the covers were only taken off once a month to give the silk underneath a delicate brushing. The crystal chandelier was shrouded in muslin so that the flies should not spot it. In front of the chimney-piece was a fire-screen of peacocks' feathers artfully arranged and protected by glass. Though the room was never used Aunt Carrie dusted it herself every day. The dining-room was panelled and here too the chairs were under dust-covers. On the sideboard was a silver épergne, a silver coffee-pot, a silver teapot and a silver tray. Aunt Carrie and Julia's mother, Mrs. Lambert, lived in the morning-room, a long narrow room, with Empire furniture. On the walls in oval frames were oil portraits of Aunt Carrie and her deceased husband, of his father and mother, and a pastel of the dead son as a child. Here they had their work-boxes, here they read their papers, the Catholic La Croix, the Revue des Deux Mondes and the local daily, and here they played dominoes in the evening. Except on Thursday evenings when the Abbé and the Commandant La Garde, a retired naval officer, came to dinner they had their meals there; but when Julia arrived they decided that it would be more convenient to eat in the dining-room.

Aunt Carrie still wore mourning for her husband and her son. It was seldom warm enough for her to leave off the little black tricot that she crocheted herself. Mrs. Lambert wore black too, but when Monsieur L'Abbé and the Commandant came to dinner she put over her shoulders a white lace shawl that Julia had given her. After dinner they played plafond for two sous a hundred. Mrs. Lambert, because she had lived for so many years in Jersey and still went to London, knew all about the great world, and she said that a game called contract was much played, but the Commandant said it was all very well for Americans, but he was content to stick to plafond, and the Abbé said that for his part he thought it a pity that whist had been abandoned. But there, men were never satisfied with what they had; they wanted change, change, change all the time.

Every Christmas Julia gave her mother and her aunt expensive presents, but they never used them. They showed them to their friends with pride, these wonderful things that came from London, and then wrapped them up in tissue paper and put them away in cupboards. Julia had offered her mother a car, but she refused it. For the little they went out, they could go on foot; a chauffeur would steal their petrol, if he had his meals out it would be ruinous and if he had them in it would upset Annette. Annette was cook, housekeeper and housemaid. She had been with Aunt Carrie for five-andthirty years. Her niece was there to do the rough work, but Angèle was young, she wasn't forty yet, and it would hardly do to have a man constantly about the house.

They put Julia in the same room she had had as a girl when she was living with Aunt Carrie for her education. It gave her a peculiar, heart-rending sensation, indeed for a little it made her quite emotional. But she fell into the life very easily. Aunt Carrie had become a Catholic on her marriage and Mrs. Lambert, when on losing her husband she settled down in St. Malo, having received instructions from the Abbé, in due course took the same step. The two old ladies were very devout. They went to Mass every morning and to High Mass on Sundays. Otherwise they seldom went out. When they did it was to pay a ceremonious call on some old lady who had had a bereavement in the family or one of whose grandchildren was become engaged. They read their papers, and their magazine, did a great deal of sewing for charitable purposes, played dominoes and listened to the radio that Julia had given them. Though the Abbé and the Commandant had dined with them every Thursday for many years they were always in a flutter when Thursday came. The Commandant, with the sailor's downrightness that they expected of him, did not hesitate to say so if something was not cooked to his liking, and even the Abbé, though a saint, had his likes and dislikes. For instance, he was very fond of sole normande, but he insisted on its being cooked with the best butter, and with butter at the price it was since the war that was very expensive. Every Thursday morning Aunt Carrie took the cellar key from the place where she had hidden it and herself fetched a bottle of claret from the cellar. She and her sister finished what was left of it by the end of the week.

They made a great fuss of Julia. They dosed her with tisanes and were anxious that she should not sit in anything that might be thought a draught. Indeed a great part of their lives was devoted to avoiding draughts. They made her lie on sofas and were solicitous that she should cover her feet. They reasoned with her about the clothes she wore. Those silk stockings that were so thin you could see through them; and what did she wear next to her skin? Aunt Carrie would not have been surprised to learn that she wore nothing but a chemise.

“She doesn't even wear that,” said Mrs. Lambert.

“What does she wear then?”

“Panties,” said Julia.

“And a soutien-gorge, I suppose.”

“Certainly not,” cried Julia tartly.

“Then, my niece, under your dress you are naked?”

“Practically.”

“C'est de la folie,” said Aunt Carrie.

“C'est vraiment pas raisonnable, ma fille,” said Mrs. Lambert.

“And without being a prude,” added Aunt Carrie, “I must say that it is hardly decent.”

Julia showed them her clothes, and on the first Thursday after her arrival they discussed what she should wear for dinner. Aunt Carrie and Mrs. Lambert grew rather sharp with one another. Mrs. Lambert thought that since her daughter had evening dresses with her she ought to wear one, but Aunt Carrie considered it quite unnecessary.

“When I used to come and visit you in Jersey, my dear, and gentlemen were coming to dinner, I remember you would put on a tea-gown.”

“Of course a tea-gown would be very suitable.”

They looked at Julia hopefully. She shook her head.

“I would sooner wear a shroud.”

Aunt Carrie wore a high-necked dress of heavy black silk, with a string of jet, and Mrs. Lambert a similar one, but with her lace shawl and a paste necklace. The Commandant, a sturdy little man with a much-wrinkled face, white hair cut en brosse and an imposing moustache dyed a deep black, was very gallant,and though well past seventy pressed Julia's foot under the table during dinner. On the way out he seized the opportunity to pinch her bottom.

“Sex appeal,” Julia murmured to herself as with dignity she followed the two old ladies into the parlour.

They made a fuss of her, not because she was a great actress, but because she was in poor health and needed rest. Julia to her great amazement soon discovered that to them her celebrity was an embarrassment rather than an asset. Far from wanting to show her off, they did not offer to take her with them to pay calls. Aunt Carrie had brought the habit of afternoon tea with her from Jersey, and had never abandoned it. One day, soon after Julia's arrival, when they had invited some ladies to tea, Mrs. Lambert at lunch thus addressed her daughter:

“My dear, we have some very good friends at St. Malo, but of course they still look upon us as foreigners, even after all these years, and we don't like to do anything that seems at all eccentric. Naturally we don't want you to tell a lie, but unless you are forced to mention it, your Aunt Carrie thinks it would be better if you did not tell anyone that you are an actress.”

Julia was taken aback, but, her sense of humour prevailing, she felt inclined to laugh.

“If one of the friends we are expecting this afternoon happens to ask you what your husband is, it wouldn't be untrue, would it, to say that he was in business?”

“Not at all,” said Julia, permitting herself to smile.

“Of course, we know that English actresses are not like French ones,” Aunt Carrie added kindly. “It's almost an understood thing for a French actress to have a lover.”

“Dear, dear,” said Julia.

Her life in London, with its excitements, its triumphs and its pains, began to seem very far away. She found herself able soon to consider Tom and her feeling for him with a tranquil mind. She realized that her vanity had been more wounded than her heart. The days passed monotonously. Soon the only thing that recalled London to her was the arrival on Monday of the Sunday papers. She got a batch of them and spent the whole day reading them. Then she was a trifle restless. She walked on the ramparts and looked at the islands that dotted the bay. The grey sky made her sick for the grey sky of England. But by Tuesday morning she had sunk back once more into the calmness of the provincial life. She read a good deal, novels, English and French, that she bought at the local bookshop, and her favourite Verlaine. There was a tender melancholy in his verses that seemed to fit the grey Breton town, the sad old stone houses and the quietness of those steep and tortuous streets. The peaceful habits of the two old ladies, the routine of their uneventful existence and their quiet gossip, excited her compassion. Nothing had happened to them for years, nothing now would ever happen to them till they died, and then how little would their lives have signified. The strange thing was that they were content. They knew neither malice nor envy. They had achieved the aloofness from the common ties of men that Julia felt in herself when she stood at the footlights bowing to the applause of an enthusiastic audience. Sometimes she had thought that aloofness her most precious possession. In her it was born of pride; in them of humility. In both cases it brought one precious thing, liberty of spirit; but with them it was more secure.

Michael wrote to her once a week, brisk, businesslike letters in which he told her what the takings were at the Siddons and the preparations he was making for the next production; but Charles Tamerley wrote to her every day. He told her the gossip of the town, he talked in his charming, cultivated way of the pictures he saw and the books he read. He was tenderly allusive and playfully erudite. He philosophized without pedantry. He told her that he adored her. They were the most beautiful love-letters Julia had ever received, and for the sake of posterity she made up her mind to keep them. One day perhaps someone would publish them and people would go to the National Portrait Gallery and look at her portrait, the one McEvoy had painted, and sigh when they thought of the sad, romantic love-story of which she had been the heroine.

Charles had been wonderful to her during the first two weeks of her bereavement, she did not know what she would have done without him. He had always been at her beck and call. His conversation, by taking her into a different world, had soothed her nerves. Her soul had been muddied, and in his distinction of spirit she had washed herself clean. It had rested her wonderfully to wander about the galleries with him and look at pictures. She had good reason to be grateful to him. She thought of all the years he had loved her. He had waited for her now for more than twenty years. She had not been very kind to him. It would have given him so much happiness to possess her and really it would not have hurt her. She wondered why she had resisted him so long. Perhaps because he was so faithful, because his devotion was so humble, perhaps only because she wanted to preserve in his mind the ideal that he had of her. It was stupid really and she had been selfish. It occurred to her with exultation that she could at last reward him for all his tenderness, his patience and his selflessness. She had not lost the sense of unworthiness which Michael's great kindness had aroused in her, and she was remorseful still because she had been for so long impatient of him. The desire for self-sacrifice with which she left England burnt still in her breast with an eager flame. She felt that Charles was a worthy object for its exercise. She laughed a little, kindly and compassionately, as she thought of his amazement when he understood what she intended; for a moment he would hardly be able to believe it, and then what rapture, then what ecstasy! The love that he had held banked up for so many years would burst its sluices like a great torrent and in a flood o'erwhelm her. Her heart swelled at the thought of his infinite gratitude. But still he could hardly believe in his good fortune; and when it was all over and she lay in his arms she would nestle up to him and whisper tenderly:

“Was it worth waiting for?”

“Like Helen, you make me immortal with a kiss.”

It was wonderful to be able to give so much happiness to a human being.

“I'll write to him just before I leave St. Malo,” she decided.

The spring passed into summer, and at the end of July it was time for Julia to go to Paris and see about her clothes. Michael wanted to open with the new play early in September and rehearsals were to start in August. She had brought the play with her to St. Malo, intending to study her part, but the circumstances in which she lived had made it impossible. She had all the leisure she needed, but in that grey, austere and yet snug little town, in the constant company of those two old ladies whose interests were confined to the parish church and their household affairs, though it was a good play, she could take but little interest in it.

“It's high time I was getting back,” she said. “It would be hell if I really came to the conclusion that the theatre wasn't worth the fuss and bother they make about it.”

She said good-bye to her mother and to Aunt Carrie. They had been very kind to her, but she had an inkling that they would not be sorry when her departure allowed them to return to the life she had interrupted. They were a little relieved besides to know that now there was no more danger of some eccentricity, such as you must always run the risk of with an actress, which might arouse the unfavourable comment of the ladies of St. Malo.

She arrived in Paris in the afternoon, and when she was shown into her suite at the Ritz, she gave a sigh of satisfaction. It was a treat to get back to luxury. Three or four people had sent her flowers. She had a bath and changed. Charley Deveril, who always made her clothes for her, an old friend, called to take her to dinner at the Bois.

“I had a wonderful time,” she told him, “and of course, it was a grand treat for those old girls to have me there, but I have a feeling that if I'd stayed a day longer I should have been bored.”

To drive up the Champs Elysées on that lovely evening filled her with exhilaration. It was good to smell once more the smell of petrol. The cars, the taxis, the hooting of horns, the chestnut trees, the street lights, the crowd on the pavement and the crowd sitting outside the cafés; it was an enchantment. And when they got to the Château de Madrid, so gay, so civilized and so expensive, it was grand to see once more well-dressed women, decently made up, and tanned men in dinner-jackets.

“I feel like a queen returning from exile.”

Julia spent several happy days choosing her clothes and having the first fittings. She enjoyed every moment of them. But she was a woman of character, and when she had come to a decision she adhered to it; before leaving for London she wrote a note to Charles. He had been to Goodwood and Cowes and was spending twenty-four hours in London on his way to Salzburg.

CHARLES DEAR,

How wonderful that I shall see you so soon. Of course I am free on Wednesday. Shall we dine together and do you love me still?

Your JULIA.

As she stuck down the envelope she murmured: Bis dat qui cito dat. It was a Latin tag that Michael always quoted when, asked to subscribe to a charity, he sent by return of post exactly half what was expected of him.





Chapter 24


On Wednesday morning Julia had her face massaged and her hair waved. She could not make up her mind whether to wear for dinner a dress of flowered organdie, very pretty and spring-like with its suggestion of Botticelli's “Primavera,” or one of white satin beautifully cut to show off her slim young figure, and virginal; but while she was having her bath she decided on the white satin: it indicated rather delicately that the sacrifice she intended was in the nature of an expiation for her long ingratitude to Michael. She wore no jewels but a string of pearls and a diamond bracelet; besides her wedding-ring only one square-cut diamond. She would have liked to put on a slight brown tan, it looked open-air girl and suited her, but reflecting on what lay before her she refrained. She could not very well, like the actor who painted himself black all over to play Othello, tan her whole body. Always a punctual woman, she came downstairs as the front door was being opened for Charles. She greeted him with a look into which she put tenderness, a roguish charm and intimacy. Charles now wore his thinning grey hair rather long, and with advancing years his intellectual, distinguished features had sagged a little; he was slightly bowed and his clothes looked as though they needed pressing.

“Strange world we live in,” thought Julia. “Actors do their damnedest to look like gentlemen and gentlemen do all they can to look like actors.”

There was no doubt that she was making a proper effect on him. He gave her the perfect opening.

“Why are you looking so lovely tonight?” he asked.

“Because I'm looking forward to dining with you.”

With her beautiful, expressive eyes she looked deep into his. She parted her lips in the manner that she found so seductive in Romney's portraits of Lady Hamilton.

They dined at the Savoy. The head-waiter gave them a table on the gangway so that they were admirably in view. Though everyone was supposed to be out of town the grill-room was well filled. Julia bowed and smiled to various friends of whom she caught sight. Charles had much to tell her; she listened to him with flattering interest.

“You are the best company in the world, Charles,” she told him.

They had come late, they dined well, and by the time Charles had finished his brandy people were already beginning to come in for supper.

“Good gracious, are the theatres out already?” he said, glancing at his watch. “How quickly the time flies when I'm with you. D'you imagine they want to get rid of us?”

“I don't feel a bit like going to bed.”

“I suppose Michael will be getting home presently?”

“I suppose so,”

“Why don't you come back to my house and have a talk?”

That was what she called taking a cue.

“I'd love it,” she answered, putting into her tone the slight blush which she felt would have well become her cheek.

They got into his car and drove to Hill Street. He took her into his study. It was on the ground floor and looked on a tiny garden. The french windows were wide open. They sat down on a sofa.

“Put out some of the lights and let the night into the room,” said Julia. “She quoted from The Merchant of Venice. ‘In such a night as this, when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees…’”

Charles switched off everything but one shaded lamp, and when he sat down again she nestled up to him. He put his arm round her waist and she rested her head on his shoulder.

“This is heaven,” she murmured.

“I've missed you terribly all these months.”

“Did you get into mischief?”

“Well, I bought an Ingres drawing and paid a lot of money for it. I must show it to you before you go.”

“Don't forget. Where have you put it?”

She had wondered from the moment she got into the house whether the seduction would take place in the study or upstairs.

“In my bedroom,” he answered.

“That's much more comfortable really,” she reflected.

She laughed in her sleeve as she thought of poor old Charles devising a simple little trick like that to get her into his bedroom. What mugs men were! Shy, that was what was the matter with them. A sudden pang shot through her heart as she thought of Tom. Damn Tom. Charles really was very sweet and she was determined to reward him at last for his long devotion.

“You've been a wonderful friend to me, Charles,” she said in her low, rather husky voice. She turned a little so that her face was very near his, her lips, again like Lady Hamilton's, slightly open. “I'm afraid I haven't always been very kind to you.”

She looked so deliciously yielding, a ripe peach waiting to be picked, that it seemed inevitable that he should kiss her. Then she would twine her soft white arms round his neck. But he only smiled.

“You mustn't say that. You've been always divine.”

(“He's afraid, poor lamb.”) “I don't think anyone has ever been so much in love with me as you were.”

He gave her a little squeeze.

“I am still. You know that. There's never been any woman but you in my life.”

Since, however, he did not take the proffered lips she slightly turned. She looked reflectively at the electric fire. Pity it was unlit. The scene wanted a fire.

“How different everything would have been if we'd bolted that time. Heigh-ho.”

She never quite knew what heigh-ho meant, but they used it a lot on the stage, and said with a sigh it always sounded very sad.

“England would have lost its greatest actress. I know now how dreadfully selfish it was of me ever to propose it.”

“Success isn't everything. I sometimes wonder whether to gratify my silly little ambition I didn't miss the greatest thing in the world. After all, love is the only thing that matters.” And now she looked at him again with eyes more beautiful than ever in their melting tenderness. “D'you know, I think that now, if I had my time over again, I'd say take me.”

She slid her hand down to take his. He gave it a graceful pressure.

“Oh, my dear.”

“I've so often thought of that dream villa of ours. Olive trees and oleanders and the blue sea. Peace. Sometimes I'm appalled by the dullness and vulgarity of my life. What you offered was beauty. It's too late now, I know; I didn't know then how much I cared for you, I never dreamt that as the years went on you would mean more and more to me.”

“It's heavenly to hear you say that, my sweet. It makes up for so much.”

“I'd do anything in the world for you, Charles. I've been selfish. I've ruined your life, I didn't know what I was doing.”

Her voice was low and tremulous and she threw back her head so that her neck was like a white column. Her décolleté showed part of her small firm breasts and with her hands she pressed them forward a little.

“You mustn't say that, you mustn't think that,” he answered gently. “You've been perfect always. I wouldn't have had you otherwise. Oh, my dear, life is so short and love is so transitory. The tragedy of life is that sometimes we get what we want. Now that I look back on our long past together I know that you were wiser than I. ‘What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape?’ Don't you remember how it goes? ‘Never, never canst thou kiss, though winning near the goal—yet, do not grieve; she cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss. For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!’”

(“Idiotic.”) “Such lovely lines,” she sighed. “Perhaps you're right. Heigh-ho.”

He went on quoting. That was a trick of his that Julia had always found somewhat tiresome.

“‘Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed

Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;

And, happy melodist, unwearied,

For ever piping songs for ever new!…’”



It gave Julia an opportunity to think. She stared in the unlit fire, her gaze intent, as though she were entranced by the exquisite beauty of those words. It was quite obvious that he just hadn't understood. It could hardly be wondered at. She had been deaf to his passionate entreaties for twenty years, and it was very natural if he had given up his quest as hopeless. It was like Mount Everest; if those hardy mountaineers who had tried for so long in vain to reach the summit finally found an easy flight of steps that led to it, they simply would not believe their eyes: they would think there was a catch in it. Julia felt that she must make herself a little plainer; she must, as it were, reach out a helping hand to the weary pilgrim.

“It's getting dreadfully late,” she said softly. “Show me your new drawing and then I must go home.”

He rose and she gave him both her hands so that he should help her up from the sofa. They went upstairs. His pyjamas and dressing-gown were neatly arranged on a chair.

“How well you single men do yourselves. Such a cosy, friendly bedroom.”

He took the framed drawing off the wall and brought it over for her to look at under the light. It was a portrait in pencil of a stoutish woman in a bonnet and a low-necked dress with puffed sleeves. Julia thought her plain and the dress ridiculous.

“Isn't it ravishing?” she cried.

“I knew you'd like it. A good drawing, isn't it?”

“Amazing.”

He put the little picture back on its nail. When he turned round again she was standing near the bed with her hands behind her back, a little like a Circassian slave introduced by the chief eunuch to the inspection of the Grand Vizier; there was a hint of modest withdrawal in her bearing, a delicious timidity, and at the same time the virgin's anticipation that she was about to enter into her kingdom. Julia gave a sigh that was ever so slightly voluptuous.

“My dear, it's been such a wonderful evening. I've never felt so close to you before.”

She slowly raised her hands from behind her back and with the exquisite timing that came so naturally to her moved them forwards, stretching out her arms, and held them palms upward as though there rested on them, invisibly, a lordly dish, and on the dish lay her proffered heart. Her beautiful eyes were tender and yielding and on her lips played a smile of shy surrender.

She saw Charles's smile freeze on his face. He had understood all right.

(“Christ, he doesn't want me. It was all a bluff.”) The revelation for a moment staggered her. (“God, how am I going to get out of it? What a bloody fool I must look.”)

She very nearly lost her poise. She had to think like lightning. He was standing there, looking at her with an embarrassment that he tried hard to conceal. Julia was panic-stricken. She could not think what to do with those hands that held the lordly dish; God knows, they were small, but at the moment they felt like legs of mutton hanging there. Nor did she know what to say. Every second made her posture and the situation more intolerable.

(“The skunk, the dirty skunk. Codding me all these years.”)

She did the only thing possible. She continued the gesture. Counting so that she should not go too fast, she drew her hands towards one another, till she could clasp them, and then throwing back her head, raised them, very slowly, to one side of her neck. The attitude she reached was as lovely as the other, and it was the attitude that suggested to her what she had to say. Her deep, rich voice trembled a little with emotion.

“I'm so glad when I look back to think that we have nothing to reproach ourselves with. The bitterness of life is not death, the bitterness of life is that love dies. (She'd heard something like that said in a play.) If we'd been lovers you'd have grown tired of me long ago, and what should we have now to look back on but regret for our own weakness? What was that line of Shelley's that you said just now about fading?”

“Keats,” he corrected. “‘she cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss.’”

“That's it. Go on.”

She was playing for time.

“‘For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair.’”

She threw her arms wide in a great open gesture and tossed her curly head. She'd got it.

“It's true, isn't it? ‘For ever wilt thou love and I be fair.’ What fools we should have been if for a few moments' madness we had thrown away the wonderful happiness our friendship has brought us. We have nothing to be ashamed of. We're clean. We can walk with our heads held high and look the whole world in the face.”

She instinctively felt that this was an exit line, and suiting her movements to the words, with head held high, backed to the door and flung it open. Her power was such that she carried the feeling of the scene all the way down the stairs with her. Then she let it fall and with the utmost simplicity turned to Charles who had followed her.

“My cloak.”

“The car is there,” he said as he wrapped it round her. “I'll drive you home.”

“No, let me go alone. I want to stamp this hour on my heart. Kiss me before I go.”

She held up her lips to him. He kissed them. But she broke away from him, with a stifled sob, and tearing open the door ran to the waiting car.

When she got home and stood in her own bedroom she gave a great whoof of relief.

“The bloody fool. Fancy me being taken in like that. Thank God, I got out of it all right. He's such an ass, I don't suppose he began to see what I was getting at.” But that frozen smile disconcerted her. “He may have suspected, he couldn't have been certain, and afterwards he must have been pretty sure he'd made a mistake. My God, the rot I talked. It seemed to go down all right, I must say. Lucky I caught on when I did. In another minute I'd have had me dress off. That wouldn't have been so damned easy to laugh away.”

Julia began to titter. The situation was mortifying, of course, he had made a damned fool of her, but if you had any sense of humour you could hardly help seeing that there was a funny side to it. She was sorry that there was nobody to whom she could tell it; even if it was against herself it would make a good story. What she couldn't get over was that she had fallen for the comedy of undying passion that he had played all those years; for of course it was just a pose; he liked to see himself as the constant adorer, and the last thing he wanted, apparently, was to have his constancy rewarded.

“Bluffed me, he did, completely bluffed me.”

But an idea occurred to Julia and she ceased to smile. When a woman's amorous advances are declined by a man she is apt to draw one or two conclusions; one is that he is homosexual and the other is that he is impotent. Julia reflectively lit a cigarette. She asked herself if Charles had used his devotion to her as a cover to distract attention from his real inclinations. But she shook her head. If he had been homosexual she would surely have had some hint of it; after all, in society since the war they talked of practically nothing else. Of course it was quite possible he was impotent. She reckoned out his age. Poor Charles. She smiled again. And if that were the case it was he, not she, who had been placed in an embarrassing and even ridiculous position. He must have been scared stiff, poor lamb. Obviously it wasn't the sort of thing a man liked to tell a woman, especially if he were madly in love with her; the more she thought of it the more probable she considered the explanation. She began to feel very sorry for him, almost maternal in fact.

“I know what I'll do,” she said, as she began to undress, “I'll send him a huge bunch of white lilies tomorrow.”





Chapter 25


Julia lay awake next morning for some time before she rang her bell. She thought. When she reflected on her adventure of the previous night she could not but be pleased that she had shown so much presence of mind. It was hardly true to say that she had snatched victory from defeat, but looking upon it as a strategic retreat her conduct had been masterly. She was, notwithstanding, ill at ease. There might be yet another explanation for Charles's singular behaviour. It was possible that he did not desire her because she was not desirable. The notion had crossed her mind in the night, and though she had at once dismissed it as highly improbable, there was no denying it, at that hour of the morning it had a nasty look. She rang. As a rule, since Michael often came in while Julia had breakfast, Evie, when she had drawn the curtains, handed her a mirror and a comb, her powder and lipstick. On this occasion, instead of running the comb rapidly through her hair and giving her face a perfunctory dab with the puff, Julia took some trouble. She painted her lips with care and put on some rouge; she arranged her hair.

“Speaking without passion or prejudice,” she said, still looking at herself in the glass, when Evie placed the breakfast tray on her bed, “would you say I was by way of being a good-looking woman, Evie?”

“I must know what I'm letting myself in for before answering that question.”

“You old bitch,” said Julia.

“You're no beauty, you know.”

“No great actress ever has been.”

“When you're all dolled up posh like you was last night, and got the light be'ind you, I've seen worse, you know.”

(“Fat lot of good it did me last night.”) “What I want to say is, if I really set my mind on getting off with a man, d'you think I could?”

“Knowing what men are, I wouldn't be surprised. Who d'you want to get off with now?”

“Nobody. I was only talking generally.”

Evie sniffed and drew her forefinger along her nostrils.

“Don't sniff like that. If your nose wants blowing, blow it.”

Julia ate her boiled egg slowly. She was busy with her thoughts. She looked at Evie. Funny-looking old thing of course, but one never knew.

“Tell me, Evie, do men ever try to pick you up in the street?”

“Me? I'd like to see 'em try.”

“So would I, to tell you the truth. Women are always telling me how men follow them in the street and if they stop and look in at a shop window come up and try to catch their eye. Sometimes they have an awful bother getting rid of them.”

“Disgusting, I call it.”

“I don't know about that. It's rather flattering. You know, it's a most extraordinary thing, no one ever follows me in the street. I don't remember a man ever having tried to pick me up.”

“Oh, well, you walk along Edgware Road one evening. You'll get picked up all right.”

“I shouldn't know what to do if I was.”

“Call a policeman,” said Evie grimly.

“I know a girl who was looking in a shop window in Bond Street, a hat shop, and a man came up and asked her if she'd like a hat. I'd love one, she said, and they went in and she chose one and gave her name and address, he paid for it on the nail, and then she said, thank you so much, and walked out while he was waiting for the change.”

“That's what she told you.” Evie's sniff was sceptical. She gave Julia a puzzled look. “What's the idea?”

“Oh, nothing. I was only wondering why in point of fact I never have been accosted by a man. It's not as if I had no sex appeal.”

But had she? She made up her mind to put the matter to the test.

That afternoon, when she had had her sleep, she got up, made up a little more than usual, and without calling Evie put on a dress that was neither plain nor obviously expensive and a red straw hat with a wide brim.

“I don't want to look like a tart,” she said as she looked at herself in the glass. “On the other hand I don't want to look too respectable.”

She tiptoed down the stairs so that no one should hear her and closed the door softly behind her. She was a trifle nervous, but pleasantly excited; she felt that she was doing something rather shocking. She walked through Connaught Square into the Edgware Road. It was about five o'clock. There was a dense line of buses, taxis and lorries, bicyclists dangerously threaded their way through the traffic. The pavements were thronged. She sauntered slowly north. At first she walked with her eyes straight in front of her, looking neither to the right nor to the left, but soon realized that this was useless. She must look at people if she wanted them to look at her. Two or three times when she saw half a dozen persons gazing at a shop window she paused and gazed too, but none of them took any notice of her. She strolled on. People passed her in one direction and another. They seemed in a hurry. No one paid any attention to her. When she saw a man alone coming towards her she gave him a bold stare, but he passed on with a blank face. It occurred to her that her expression was too severe, and she let a slight smile hover on her lips. Two or three men thought she was smiling at them and quickly averted their gaze. She looked back as one of them passed her and he looked back too, but catching her eye he hurried on. She felt a trifle snubbed and decided not to look round again. She walked on and on. She had always heard that the London crowd was the best behaved in the world, but really its behaviour on this occasion was unconscionable.

“This couldn't happen to one in the streets of Paris, Rome or Berlin,” she reflected.

She decided to go as far as the Marylebone Road, and then turn back. It would be too humiliating to have to go home without being once accosted. She was walking so slowly that passers-by sometimes jostled her. This irritated her.

“I ought to have tried Oxford Street,” she said. “That fool Evie. The Edgware Road's obviously a wash-out.”

Suddenly her heart gave an exultant leap. She had caught a young man's eye and she was sure that there was a gleam in it. He passed, and she had all she could do not to turn round. She started, for in a moment he passed her again, he had retraced his steps, and this time he gave her a stare. She shot him a glance and then modestly lowered her eyes. He fell back and she was conscious that he was following her. It was all right. She stopped to look into a shop window and he stopped too. She knew how to behave now. She pretended to be absorbed in the goods that were displayed, but just before she moved on gave him a quick flash of her faintly-smiling eyes. He was rather short, he looked like a clerk or a shop-walker, he wore a grey suit and a brown soft hat. He was not the man she would have chosen to be picked up by, but there it was, he was evidently trying to pick her up. She forgot that she was beginning to feel tired. She did not know what would happen next. Of course she wasn't going to let the thing go too far, but she was curious to see what his next step would be. She wondered what he would say to her. She was excited and pleased; it was a weight off her mind. She walked on slowly and she knew he was close behind her. She stopped at another shop window, and this time when he stopped he was close beside her. Her heart began to beat wildly. It was really beginning to look like an adventure.

“I wonder if he'll ask me to go to a hotel with him. I don't suppose he could afford that. A cinema. That's it. It would be rather fun.”

She looked him full in the face now and very nearly smiled. He took off his hat.

“Miss Lambert, isn't it?”

She almost jumped out of her skin. She was indeed so taken aback that she had not the presence of mind to deny it.

“I thought I recognized you the moment I saw you, that's why I turned back, to make sure, see, and I said to meself, if that's not Julia Lambert I'm Ramsay Macdonald. Then you stopped to look in that shop window and that give me the chance to 'ave a good look at you. What made me 'esitate was seeing you in the Edgware Road. It seems so funny, if you know what I mean.”

It was much funnier than he imagined. Anyhow it didn't matter if he knew who she was. She ought to have guessed that she couldn't go far in London without being recognized. He had a cockney accent and a pasty face, but she gave him a jolly, friendly smile. He mustn't think she was putting on airs.

“Excuse me talking to you, not 'aving been introduced and all that, but I couldn't miss the opportunity. Will you oblige me with your autograph?”

Julia caught her breath. It couldn't be that this was why he had followed her for ten minutes. He must have thought that up as an excuse for speaking to her. Well, she would play up.

“I shall be delighted. But I can't very well give it you in the street. People would stare so.”

“That's right. Look here, I was just going along to 'ave my tea. There's a Lyons at the next corner. Why don't you come in and 'ave a cup too?”

She was getting on. When they'd had tea he'd probably suggest going to the pictures.

“All right,” she said.

They walked along till they came to the shop and took their places at a small table.

“Two teas, please, miss,” he ordered. “Anything to eat?” And when Julia declined: “Scone and butter for one, miss.”

Julia was able now to have a good look at him. Though stocky and short he had good features, his black hair was plastered down on his head and he had fine eyes, but his teeth were poor and his pale skin gave him an unhealthy look. There was a sort of impudence in his manner that Julia did not much like, but then, as she sensibly reflected, you could hardly expect the modesty of the violet in a young man who picked you up in the Edgware Road.

“Before we go any further let's 'ave this autograph, eh? Do it now, that's my motto.”

He took a fountain pen from his pocket and from a bulging pocket-book a large card.

“One of our trade cards,” he said. “That'll be O.K.”

Julia thought it silly to carry the subterfuge to this length, but she good-humouredly signed her name on the back of the card.

“Do you collect autographs?” she asked him with a subtle smile.

“Me? Noa. I think it's a lot of tommyrot. My young lady does. She's got Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks and I don't know what all. Show you 'er photo if you like.”

From his pocket-book he extracted a snapshot of a rather pert-looking young woman showing all her teeth in a cinema smile.

“Pretty,” said Julia.

“And how. We're going to the pictures tonight. She will be surprised when I give her your autograph. The first thing I said to meself when I knew it was you was, I'll get Julia Lambert's autograph for Gwen or die in the attempt. We're going to get married in August, when I 'ave my 'oliday, you know; we're going to the Isle of Wight for the 'oneymoon. I shall 'ave a rare lot of fun with 'er over this. She won't believe me when I tell her you an' me 'ad tea together, she'll think I'm kidding, and then I'll show 'er the autograph, see?”

Julia listened to him politely, but the smile had left her face.

“I'm afraid I shall have to go in a minute,” she said. “I'm late already.”

“I 'aven't got too much time meself. You see, meeting my young lady, I want to get away from the shop on the tick.”

The check had been put on the table when the girl brought their tea, and when they got up Julia took a shilling out of her bag.

“What are you doing that for? You don't think I'm going to let you pay. I invited you.”

“That's very kind of you.”

“But I'll tell you what you can do, let me bring my young lady to see you in your dressing-room one day. Just shake 'ands with her, see? It would mean a rare lot to her. Why, she'd go on talking about it the rest of her life.”

Julia's manner had been for some minutes growing stiffer and now, though gracious still, it was almost haughty.

“I'm sorry, but we never allow strangers behind.”

“Oh, sorry. You don't mind my asking though, do you? I mean, it's not as if it was for meself.”

“Not at all. I quite understand.”

She signalled to a cab crawling along the curb and gave her hand to the young man.

“Good-bye, Miss Lambert. So long, good luck and all that sort of thing. And thanks for the autograph.”

Julia sat in the corner of the taxi raging.

“Vulgar little beast. Him and his young lady. The nerve of asking if he could bring her to see me.”

When she got home she went upstairs to her room. She snatched her hat off her head and flung it angrily on the bed. She strode over to the looking-glass and stared at herself.

“Old, old, old,” she muttered. “There are no two ways about it; I'm entirely devoid of sex appeal. You wouldn't believe it, would you? You'd say it was preposterous. What other explanation is there? I walk from one end of the Edgware Road to the other and God knows I'd dressed the part perfectly, and not a man pays the smallest attention to me except a bloody little shop-assistant who wants my autograph for his young lady. It's absurd. A lot of sexless bastards. I don't know what's coming to the English. The British Empire!”

The last words she said with a scorn that would have withered a whole front bench of cabinet ministers. She began to gesticulate.

“It's ridiculous to suppose that I could have got to my position if I hadn't got sex appeal. What do people come to see an actress for? Because they want to go to bed with her. Do you mean to tell me that I could fill a theatre for three months with a rotten play if I hadn't got sex appeal? What is sex appeal anyway?”

She paused, looking at herself reflectively.

“Surely I can act sex appeal. I can act anything.”

She began to think of the actresses who notoriously had it, of one especially, Lydia Mayne, whom one always engaged when one wanted a vamp. She was not much of an actress, but in certain parts she was wonderfully effective. Julia was a great mimic, and now she began to do an imitation of Lydia Mayne. Her eyelids drooped sensually over her eyes as Lydia's did and her body writhed sinuously in her dress. She got into her eyes the provoking indecency of Lydia's glance and into her serpentine gestures that invitation which was Lydia's speciality. She began to speak in Lydia's voice, with the lazy drawl that made every remark she uttered sound faintly obscene.

“Oh, my dear man, I've heard that sort of thing so often. I don't want to make trouble between you and your wife. Why won't men leave me alone?”

It was a cruel caricature that Julia gave. It was quite ruthless. It amused her so much that she burst out laughing.

“Well, there's one thing, I may not have any sex appeal, but after seeing my imitation there aren't many people who'd think Lydia had either.”

It made her feel much better.





Chapter 26


Rehearsals began and distracted Julia's troubled mind. The revival that Michael put on when she went abroad had done neither very well nor very badly, but rather than close the theatre he was keeping it in the bill till Nowadays was ready. Because he was acting two matinées a week, and the weather was hot, he determined that they should take rehearsals easy. They had a month before them.

Though Julia had been on the stage so long she had never lost the thrill she got out of rehearsing, and the first rehearsal still made her almost sick with excitement. It was the beginning of a new adventure. She did not feel like a leading lady then, she felt as gay and eager as if she were a girl playing her first small part. But at the same time she had a delicious sense of her own powers. Once more she had the chance to exercise them.

At eleven o'clock she stepped on to the stage. The cast stood about idly. She kissed and shook hands with the artists she knew and Michael with urbanity introduced to her those she did not. She greeted Avice Crichton with cordiality. She told her how pretty she was and how much she liked her hat; she told her about the lovely frocks she had chosen for her in Paris.

“Have you seen Tom lately?” she asked.

“No, I haven't. He's away on his holiday.”

“Oh, yes. He's a nice little thing, isn't he?”

“Sweet.”

The two women smiled into one another's eyes. Julia watched her when she read her part and listened to her intonations. She smiled grimly. It was exactly what she had expected. Avice was one of those actresses who were quite sure of themselves from the first rehearsal. She didn't know what was coming to her. Tom meant nothing to Julia any more, but she had a score to settle with Avice and she wasn't going to forget it. The slut!

The play was a modern version of The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, but with the change of manners of this generation it had been treated from the standpoint of comedy. Some of the old characters were introduced, and Aubrey Tanqueray, now a very old man, appeared in the second act. After Paula's death he had married for the third time. Mrs. Cortelyon had undertaken to compensate him for his unfortunate experience with his second wife, and she was now a cantankerous and insolent old lady. Ellean, his daughter, and Hugh Ardale had agreed to let bygones be bygones, for Paula's tragic death had seemed to wipe out the recollection of his lapse into extraconjugal relations; and they had married. He was now a retired brigadier-general who played golf and deplored the decline of the British Empire—“Gad, sir, I'd stand those damned socialists against a wall and shoot 'em if I had my way”; whereas Ellean, by this time an elderly woman, after a prudish youth had become gay, modem and plain-spoken. The character that Michael played was called Robert Humphreys, and like the Aubrey of Pinero's play he was a widower with an only daughter; he had been a consul in China for many years, and having come into money had retired and was settling on the estate, near where the Tanquerays still lived, which a cousin had left him. His daughter, Honor (this was the part for which Avice Crichton had been engaged), was studying medicine with the intention of practising in India. Alone in London, and friendless after so many years abroad, he had picked up a well-known woman of the town called Mrs. Marten. Mrs. Marten belonged to the same class as Paula, but she was less exclusive; she “did” the summer and the winter season at Cannes and in the intervals lived in a flat in Albermarle Street where she entertained the officers of His Majesty's brigade. She played a good game of bridge and an even better game of golf. The part well suited Julia.

The author followed the lines of the old play closely. Honor announced to her father that she was abandoning her medical studies and until her marriage wished to live with him, for she had just become engaged to Ellean's son, a young guardsman. Somewhat disconcerted, Robert Humphreys broke to her his intention of marrying Mrs. Marten. Honor took the information with composure.

“Of course you know she's a tart, don't you?” she said coolly.

He, much embarrassed, spoke of the unhappy life she had led and how he wanted to make up to her for all she had suffered.

“Oh, don't talk such rot,” she answered. “It's grand work if you can get it.”

Ellean's son had been one of Mrs. Marten's numerous lovers just as Ellean's husband had been one of Paula Tanqueray's. When Robert Humphreys brought his wife down to his home in the country and this fact was discovered, they decided that Honor must be informed. To their consternation Honor did not turn a hair. She knew already.

“I was as pleased as Punch when I found out,” she told her stepmother. “You see, darling, you can tell me if he's all right in bed.”

This was Avice Crichton's best scene, it lasted a full ten minutes, and Michael had realized from the beginning that it was effective and important. Avice's cold, matter-of-fact prettiness had been exactly what he had thought would be so telling in the circumstances. But after half-a-dozen rehearsals he began to think that that was all she had to give. He talked it over with Julia.

“How d'you think Avice is shaping?”

“It's early days to tell yet.”

“I'm not happy about her. You said she could act. I've seen no sign of it yet.”

“It's a cast-iron part. She can't really go wrong in it.”

“You know just as well as I do that there's no such thing as a cast-iron part. However good a part is, it has to be acted for all it's worth. I'm not sure if it wouldn't be better to kick her out and get somebody else.”

“That wouldn't be so easy. I think you ought to give her a chance.”

“She's so awkward, her gestures are so meaningless.”

Julia reflected. She had her reasons for wishing to keep Avice in the cast. She knew her well enough to be sure that if she were dismissed she would tell Tom that it was because Julia was jealous of her. He loved her and would believe anything she said. He might even think that Julia had put this affront on her in revenge for his desertion. No, no, she must stay. She must play the part, and fail; and Tom must see with his own eyes what a bad actress she was. They both of them thought the play would make her. Fools. It would kill her.

“You know how clever you are, Michael, I'm sure you can train her if you're willing to take a little trouble.”

“But that's just it, she doesn't seem able to take direction. I show her exactly how to say a line and then she goes and says it in her own way. You wouldn't believe it, but sometimes I can hardly help thinking she's under the delusion that she knows better than I do.”

“You make her nervous. When you tell her to do something she's in such a dither she doesn't know what she's up to.”

“Good lord, no one could be more easy than I am. I've never even been sharp with her.”

Julia gave him an affectionate smile.

“Are you going to pretend that you really don't know what's the matter with her?”

“No, what?”

He looked at her with a blank face.

“Come off it, darling. Haven't you noticed that she's madly in love with you?”

“With me? But I thought she was practically engaged to Tom. Nonsense. You're always fancying things like that.”

“But it's quite obvious. After all she isn't the first who's fallen for your fatal beauty, and I don't suppose she'll be the last.”

“Heaven knows, I don't want to queer poor Tom's pitch.”

“It's not your fault, is it?”

“What d'you want me to do about it then?”

“Well, I think you ought to be nice to her. She's very young, you know, poor thing. What she wants is a helping hand. If you took her alone a few times and went through the part with her I believe you could do wonders. Why don't you take her out to lunch one day and have a talk to her?”

She saw the gleam in Michael's eyes as he considered the proposition and the shadow of a smile that was outlined on his lips.

“Of course the great thing is to get the play as well acted as we can.”

“I know it'll be a bore for you, but honestly, for the sake of the play I think it'll be worth while.”

“You know that I would never do anything to upset you, Julia. I mean, I'd much sooner fire the girl and get someone else in her place.”

“I think that would be such a mistake. I'm convinced that if you'll only take enough trouble with her she'll give a very good performance.”

He walked up and down the room once or twice. He seemed to be considering the matter from every side.

“Well, I suppose it's my job to get the best performance I can out of every member of my cast. In every case you have to find out which is the best method of approach.”

He threw out his chin and drew in his belly. He straightened his back. Julia knew that Avice Crichton would hold the part, and next day at rehearsal he took her aside and had a long talk with her. She knew by his manner exactly what he was saying and, watching them out of the corner of her eye, presently she saw Avice nod and smile. He had asked her to lunch with him. With a contented mind Julia went on studying her part.





Chapter 27


They had been rehearsing for a fortnight when Roger arrived from Austria. He had been spending a few weeks on a Carinthian lake, and after a day or two in London was to go and stay with friends in Scotland. Since Michael had to dine early to go to the theatre Julia went to meet him by herself. When she was dressing, Evie, sniffing as usual, told her that she was taking as much pains to make herself look nice as if she were going to meet a young man. She wanted Roger to be proud of her, and certainly she looked very young and pretty in her summer frock as she strolled up and down the platform. You would have thought, but wrongly, that she was perfectly unconscious of the attention she attracted. Roger, after a month in the sun, was very brown, but he was still rather spotty and he seemed thinner than when he had left London at the New Year. She hugged him with exuberant affection. He smiled slightly.

They were to dine by themselves. Julia asked him if he would like to go to a play afterwards or to the pictures, but he said he preferred to stay at home.

“That'll be much nicer,” she answered, “and we'll just talk.”

There was indeed a subject that Michael had invited her to discuss with Roger when the opportunity arose. Now that he was going to Cambridge so soon he ought to make up his mind what he wanted to do. Michael was afraid that he would drift through his time there and then go into a broker's office or even on the stage. Thinking that Julia had more tact than he, and more influence with the boy, he had urged her to put before him the advantages of the Foreign Office and the brilliant possibilities of the Bar. Julia thought it would be strange if in the course of two or three hours' conversation she could not find a way to lead to this important topic. At dinner she tried to get him to talk about Vienna. But he was reticent.

“Oh, I just did the usual things, you know. I saw the sights and worked hard at my German. I knocked about in beer places. I went to the opera a good deal.”

She wondered if he had had any love affairs.

“Anyhow, you haven't come back engaged to a Viennese maiden,” she said, thinking to draw him out.

He gave her a reflective, but faintly amused look. You might almost have thought that he had seen what she was driving at. It was strange; though he was her own son she did not feel quite at home with him.

“No,” he answered, “I was too busy to bother with that sort of thing.”

“I suppose you went to all the theatres.”

“I went two or three times.”

“Did you see anything that would be any use to me?”

“You know, I never thought about that.”

His answer might have seemed a little ungracious but that it was accompanied by a smile, and his smile was very sweet. Julia wondered again how it was that he had inherited so little of Michael's beauty and of her charm. His red hair was nice, but his pale lashes gave his face a sort of empty look. Heaven only knew where with such a father and such a mother he had got his rather lumpy figure. He was eighteen now; it was time he fined down. He seemed a trifle apathetic; he had none of her sparkling vitality; she could picture the vividness with which she would have narrated her experiences if she had just spent six months in Vienna. Why, already she had made a story about her stay at St. Malo with Aunt Carrie and her mother that made people roar with laughter. They all said it was as good as a play, and her own impression was that it was much better than most. She told it to Roger now. He listened with his slow, quiet smile; but she had an uneasy feeling that he did not think it quite so funny as she did. She sighed in her heart. Poor lamb, he could have no sense of humour. Then he made some remark that led her to speak of Nowadays. She told him its story, and explained what she was doing with her part; she talked to him of the cast and described the sets. At the end of dinner it suddenly struck her that she had been talking entirely of herself and her own interests. She did not know how she had been led to do this, and the suspicion flashed across her mind that Roger had guided the conversation in that direction so that it should be diverted from him and his affairs. But she put it aside. He really wasn't intelligent enough for that. It was later when they sat in the drawing-room listening to the radio and smoking, that Julia found the chance to slip in, apparently in the most casual fashion, the question she had prepared.

“Have you made up your mind what you're going to be yet?”

“No. Is there any hurry?”

“You know how ignorant I am about everything. Your father says that if you're going to be a barrister you ought to work at law when you go to Cambridge. On the other hand, if you fancy the Foreign Office, you should take up modern languages.”

He looked at her for so long, with that queer, reflective air of his, that Julia had some difficulty in holding her light, playful and yet affectionate expression.

“If I believed in God I'd be a priest,” he said at last.

“A priest?”

Julia could hardly believe her ears. She had a feeling of acute discomfort. But his answer sank into her mind and in a flash she saw him as a cardinal, inhabiting a beautiful palazzo in Rome, filled with wonderful pictures, and surrounded by obsequious prelates; and then again as a saint, in a mitre and vestments heavily embroidered with gold, with benevolent gestures distributing bread to the poor. She saw herself in a brocaded dress and a string of pearls. The mother of the Borgias.

“That was all right in the sixteenth century,” she said. “It's too late in the day for that.”

“Much.”

“I can't think what put such an idea in your head.” He did not answer, so that she had to speak again. “Aren't you happy?”

“Quite,” he smiled.

“What is it you want?”

Once again he gave her his disconcerting stare. It was hard to know if he was serious, for his eyes faintly shimmered with amusement.

“Reality.”

“What do you mean?”

“You see, I've lived all my life in an atmosphere of makebelieve. I want to get down to brass tacks. You and father are all right breathing this air, it's the only air you know and you think it's the air of heaven. It stifles me.”

Julia listened to him attentively, trying to understand what he meant.

“We're actors, and successful ones. That's why we've been able to surround you with every luxury since you were born. You could count on the fingers of one hand the actors who've sent their son to Eton.”

“I'm very grateful for all you've done for me.”

“Then what are you reproaching us for?”

“I'm not reproaching you. You've done everything you could for me. Unfortunately for me you've taken away my belief in everything.”

“We've never interfered with your beliefs. I know we're not religious people, we're actors, and after eight performances a week one wants one's Sundays to oneself. I naturally expected they'd see to all that at school.”

He hesitated a little before he spoke again. One might have thought that he had to make a slight effort over himself to continue.

“When I was just a kid, I was fourteen, I was standing one night in the wings watching you act. It must have been a pretty good scene, you said the things you had to say so sincerely, and what you were saying was so moving, I couldn't help crying. I was all worked up. I don't know how to say it quite, I was uplifted; I felt terribly sorry for you, I felt a bloody little hero; I felt I'd never do anything again that was beastly or underhand. And then you had to come to the back of the stage, near where I was standing, the tears were streaming down your face; you stood with your back to the audience and in your ordinary voice you said to the stage manager: what the bloody hell is that electrician doing with the lights? I told him to leave out the blue. And then in the same breath you turned round and faced the audience with a great cry of anguish and went on with the scene.”

“But, darling, that was acting. If an actress felt the emotions she represented she'd tear herself to pieces. I remember the scene well. It used to bring down the house. I've never heard such applause in my life.”

“I suppose I was a fool to be taken in by it. I believed you meant what you said. When I saw that it was all pretence it smashed something. I've never believed in you since. I'd been made a fool of once; I made up my mind that I wouldn't ever be made a fool of again.”

She gave him her delightful and disarming smile.

“Darling, I think you're talking nonsense.”

“Of course you do. You don't know the difference between truth and make-believe. You never stop acting. It's second nature to you. You act when there's a party here. You act to the servants, you act to Father, you act to me. To me you act the part of the fond, indulgent, celebrated mother. You don't exist, you're only the innumerable parts you've played. I've often wondered if there was ever a you or if you were never anything more than a vehicle for all these other people that you've pretended to be. When I've seen you go into an empty room I've sometimes wanted to open the door suddenly, but I've been afraid to in case I found nobody there.”

She looked up at him quickly. She shivered, for what he said gave her an eerie sensation. She listened to him attentively, with a certain anxiety, for he was so serious that she felt he was expressing something that had burdened him for years. She had never in his whole life heard him talk so much.

“D'you think I'm only sham?”

“Not quite. Because sham is all you are. Sham is your truth. Just as margarine is butter to people who don't know what butter is.”

She had a vague feeling of guilt. The Queen in Hamlet: “And let me wring your heart; for so I shall, if it be made of penetrable stuff.” Her thoughts wandered.

(“I wonder if I'm too old to play Hamlet. Siddons and Sarah Bernhardt played him. I've got better legs than any of the men I've seen in the part. I'll ask Charles what he thinks. Of course there's that bloody blank verse. Stupid of him not to write it in prose. Of course I might do it in French at the François. God,what a stunt that would be.”)

She saw herself in a black doublet, with long silk hose. “Alas, poor Yorick.” But she bethought herself.

“You can hardly say that your father doesn't exist. Why, he's been playing himself for the last twenty years.” (“Michael could play the King, not in French, of course, but if we decided to have a shot at it in London.”)

“Poor father, I suppose he's good at his job, but he's not very intelligent, is he? He's so busy being the handsomest man in England.”

“I don't think it's very nice of you to speak of your father like that.”

“Have I told you anything you don't know?” he asked coolly.

Julia wanted to smile, but would not allow the look of somewhat pained dignity to leave her face.

“It's our weakness, not our strength, that endears us to those who love us,” she replied.

“In what play did you say that?”

She repressed a gesture of annoyance. The words had come naturally to her lips, but as she said them she remembered that they were out of a play. Little brute! But they came in very appositely.

“You're hard,” she said plaintively. She was beginning to feel more and more like Hamlet's mother. “Don't you love me?”

“I might if I could find you. But where are you? If one stripped you of your exhibitionism, if one took your technique away from you, if one peeled you as one peels an onion of skin after skin of pretence and insincerity, of tags of old parts and shreds of faked emotions, would one come upon a soul at last?” He looked at her with his grave sad eyes and then he smiled a little. “I like you all right.”

“Do you believe I love you?”

“In your way.”

Julia's face was suddenly discomposed.

“If you only knew the agony I suffered when you were ill! I don't know what I should have done if you'd died!”

“You would have given a beautiful performance of a bereaved mother at the bier of her only child.”

“Not nearly such a good performance as if I'd had the opportunity of rehearsing it a few times,” Julia answered tartly. “You see, what you don't understand is that acting isn't nature; it's art, and art is something you create. Real grief is ugly; the business of the actor is to represent it not only with truth but with beauty. If I were really dying as I've died in half-a-dozen plays, d'you think I'd care whether my gestures were graceful and my faltering words distinct enough to carry to the last row of the gallery? If it's a sham it's no more a sham than a sonata of Beethoven's, and I'm no more of a sham than the pianist who plays it. It's cruel to say that I'm not fond of you. I'm devoted to you. You've been the only thing in my life.”

“No. You were fond of me when I was a kid and you could have me photographed with you. It made a lovely picture and it was fine publicity. But since then you haven't bothered much about me. I've bored you rather than otherwise. You were always glad to see me, but you were thankful that I went my own way and didn't want to take up your time. I don't blame you; you hadn't got time in your life for anyone but yourself.”

Julia was beginning to grow a trifle impatient. He was getting too near the truth for her comfort.

“You forget that young things are rather boring.”

“Crashing, I should think,” he smiled. “But then why do you pretend that you can't bear to let me out of your sight? That's just acting too.”

“You make me very unhappy. You make me feel as if I hadn't done my duty to you.”

“But you have. You've been a very good mother. You've done something for which I shall always be grateful to you, you've left me alone.”

“I don't understand what you want.”

“I told you. Reality.”

“But where are you going to find it?”

“I don't know. Perhaps it doesn't exist. I'm young still; I'm ignorant. I thought perhaps that at Cambridge, meeting people and reading books, I might discover where to look for it. If they say it only exists in God, I'm done.”

Julia was disturbed. What he said had not really penetrated to her understanding, his words were lines and the important thing was not what they meant, but whether they “got over”, but she was sensitive to the emotion she felt in him. Of course he was only eighteen, and it would be silly to take him too seriously, she couldn't help thinking he'd got all that from somebody else, and that there was a good deal of pose in it. Did anyone have ideas of his own and did anyone not pose just a wee, wee bit? But of course it might be that at the moment he felt everything he said, and it wouldn't be very nice of her to make light of it.

“Of course I see what you mean,” she said. “My greatest wish in the world is that you should be happy. I'll manage your father, and you can do as you like. You must seek your own salvation, I see that. But I think you ought to make sure that all these ideas of yours aren't just morbid. Perhaps you were too much alone in Vienna and I daresay you read too much. Of course your father and I belong to a different generation and I don't suppose we can help you. Why don't you talk it over with someone more of your own age? Tom, for instance.”

“Tom? A poor little snob. His only ambition in life is to be a gentleman, and he hasn't the sense to see that the more he tries the more hopeless it is.”

“I thought you liked him so much. Why, at Taplow last summer you just lived in his pocket.”

“I didn't dislike him. I made use of him. He could tell me a lot of things that I wanted to know. But I thought him an insignificant, silly little thing.”

Julia remembered how insanely jealous she had been of their friendship. It made her angry to think of all the agony she had wasted.

“You've dropped him, haven't you?” he asked suddenly.

She was startled.

“I suppose I have more or less.”

“I think it's very wise of you. He wasn't up to your mark.”

He looked at her with his calm, reflective eyes, and on a sudden Julia had a sickening fear that he knew that Tom had been her lover. It was impossible, she told herself, it was only her guilty conscience that made her think so; at Taplow there had been nothing; it was incredible that any of the horrid gossip had reached his ears; and yet there was something in his expression that made her certain that he knew. She was ashamed.

“I only asked him to come down to Taplow, because I thought it would be nice for you to have a boy of that age to play around with.”

“It was.”

There was in his eyes a faint twinkle of amusement. She felt desperate. She would have liked to ask him what he was grinning at, but dared not; for she knew; he was not angry with her, she could have borne that, he was merely diverted. She was bitterly hurt. She would have cried, but that he would only laugh. And what could she say to him? He believed nothing she said. Acting! For once she was at a loss how to cope with a situation. She was up against something that she did not know, something mysterious and rather frightening. Could that be reality? At that moment they heard a car drive up.

“There's your father,” she exclaimed.

What a relief! The scene was intolerable, and she was thankful that his arrival must end it. In a moment Michael, very hearty, with his chin thrust out and his belly pulled in, looking for all his fifty odd years incredibly handsome, burst into the room and, in his manly way, thrust out his hand to greet after a six months' absence his only begotten son.





Chapter 28


Three days later Roger went up to Scotland. By the exercise of some ingenuity Julia had managed that they should not again spend any length of time alone together. When they happened to be by themselves for a few minutes they talked of indifferent things. Julia was not really sorry to see him go. She could not dismiss from her mind the curious conversation she had had with him. There was one point in particular that unaccountably worried her; this was his suggestion that if she went into an empty room and someone suddenly opened the door there would be nobody there. It made her feel very uncomfortable.

“I never set out to be a raving beauty, but the one thing no one has ever denied me is personality. It's absurd to pretend that because I can play a hundred different parts in a hundred different ways I haven't got an individuality of my own. I can do that because I'm a bloody good actress.”

She tried to think what happened to her when she went alone into an empty room.

“But I never am alone, even in an empty room. There's always Michael, or Evie, or Charles, or the public; not in the flesh, of course, but in the spirit, as it were. I must speak to Charles about Roger.”

Unfortunately he was away. But he was coming back for the dress-rehearsal and the first night; he had not missed these occasions for twenty years, and they had always had supper together after the dress-rehearsal. Michael would remain in the theatre, busy with the lights and so on, so that they would be alone.They would be able to have a good talk.

She studied her part. Julia did not deliberately create the character she was going to act by observation; she had a knack of getting into the shoes of the woman she had to portray so that she thought with her mind and felt with her senses. Her intuition suggested to her a hundred small touches that afterwards amazed people by their verisimilitude; but when they asked her where she had got them she could not say. Now she wanted to show the courageous yet uneasy breeziness of the Mrs. Marten who played golf and could talk to a man like one good chap to another and yet, essentially a respectable, middle-class woman, hankered for the security of the marriage state.

Michael never liked to have a crowd at a dress-rehearsal, and this time, anxious to keep the secret of the play till the first night, he had admitted besides Charles only the people, photographers and dressmakers, whose presence was necessary. Julia spared herself. She had no intention of giving all she had to give till the first night. It was enough if her performance was adequate. Under Michael's businesslike direction everything went off without a hitch and by ten o'clock Julia and Charles were sitting in the grill-room of the Savoy. The first thing she asked him was what he thought of Avice Crichton.

“Not at all bad and wonderfully pretty. She really looked lovely in that second-act dress.”

“I'm not going to wear the dress I wore in the second act. Charley Deverill has made me another.”

He did not see the slightly humorous glance she gave him, and if he had would not have guessed what it meant. Michael, having taken Julia's advice, had gone to a good deal of trouble with Avice. He had rehearsed her by herself upstairs in his private room and had given her every intonation and every gesture. He had also, Julia had good reason to believe, lunched with her several times and taken her out to supper. The result of all this was that she was playing the part uncommonly well. Michael rubbed his hands.

“I'm very pleased with her. I think she'll make quite a hit. I've half a mind to give her a contract.”

“I wouldn't,” said Julia. “Not till after the first night. You can never really tell how a performance is going to pan out till you've got an audience.”

“She's a nice girl and a perfect lady.”

“A nice girl, I suppose, because she's madly in love with you, and a perfect lady because she's resisting your advances till she's got a contract.”

“Oh, my dear, don't be silly. Why, I'm old enough to be her father.”

But he smiled complacently. She knew very well that his lovemaking went no farther than holding hands and a kiss or two in a taxi, but she knew also that it flattered him to imagine that she suspected him capable of infidelity.

But now Julia, having satisfied her appetite with proper regard for her figure, attacked the subject which was on her mind.

“Charles dear, I want to talk to you about Roger.”

“Oh yes, he came back the other day, didn't he? How is he?”

“My dear, a most terrible thing has happened. He's come back a fearful prig and I don't know what to do about it.”

She gave him her version of the conversation. She left out one or two things that it seemed inconvenient to mention, but what she told was on the whole accurate.

“The tragic thing is that he has absolutely no sense of humour,” she finished.

“After all he's only eighteen.”

“You could have knocked me down with a feather when he said all those things to me. I felt just like Balaam when his ass broke into light conversation.”

She gave him a gay look, but he did not even smile. He did not seem to think her remark as funny as she did.

“I can't imagine where he got his ideas. It's absurd to think that he could have thought out all that nonsense for himself.”

“Are you sure that boys of that age don't think more than we older people imagine? It's a sort of puberty of the spirit and its results are often strange.”

“It seems so deceitful of Roger to have harboured thoughts like those all these years and never breathed a word about them. He might have been accusing me.” She gave a chuckle. “To tell you the truth, when Roger was talking to me I felt just like Hamlet's mother.” Then with hardly a break: “I wonder if I'm too old to play Hamlet?”

“Gertrude isn't a very good part, is it?”

Julia broke into a laugh of frank amusement.

“Don't be idiotic, Charles. I wouldn't play the Queen. I'd play Hamlet.”

“D'you think it's suited to a woman?”

“Mrs. Siddons played it and so did Sarah Bernhardt. It would set a seal on my career, if you know what I mean. Of course there's the difficulty of the blank verse.”

“I have heard actors speak it so that it was indistinguishable from prose,” he answered.

“Yes, but that's not quite the same, is it?”

“Were you nice to Roger?”

She was surprised at his going back to that subject so suddenly, but she returned to it with a smile.

“Oh, charming.”

“It's hard not to be impatient with the absurdity of the young; they tell us that two and two make four as though it had never occurred to us, and they're disappointed if we can't share their surprise when they have just discovered that a hen lays an egg. There's a lot of nonsense in their ranting and raving, but it's not all nonsense. One ought to sympathize with them; one ought to do one's best to understand. One has to remember how much has to be forgotten and how much has to be learnt when for the first time one faces life. It's not very easy to give up one's ideals, and the brute facts of every day are bitter pills to swallow. The spiritual conflicts of adolescence can be very severe and one can do so little to resolve them.”

“But you don't really think there's anything in all this stuff of Roger's? I believe it's all a lot of communist nonsense that he's learnt in Vienna. I wish we'd never sent him there.”

“You may be right. It may be that in a year or two he'll lose sight of the clouds of glory and accept the chain. It may be that he'll find what he's looking for, if not in God, then in art.”

“I should hate him to be an actor if that's what you mean.”

“No, I don't think he'll fancy that.”

“And of course he can't be a playwright, he hasn't a sense of humour.”

“I daresay he'll be quite content to go into the Foreign Office. It would be an asset to him there.”

“What would you advise me to do?”

“Nothing. Let him be. That's probably the greatest kindness you can do him.”

“But I can't help being worried about him.”

“You needn't be. Be hopeful. You thought you'd only given birth to an ugly duckling; perhaps he's going to turn into a white-winged swan.”

Charles was not giving Julia what she wanted. She had expected him to be more sympathetic.

“I suppose he's getting old, poor dear,” she reflected. “He's losing his grip of things. He must have been impotent for years; I wonder it never struck me before.”

She asked what the time was.

“I think I ought to go. I must get a long night's rest.”

Julia slept well and when she awoke had at once a feeling of exultation. Tonight was the first night. It gave her a little thrill of pleasure to recollect that people had already been assembling at the pit and gallery doors when she left the theatre after the dress-rehearsal, and now at ten in the morning there was probably already a long queue.”

“Lucky it's a fine day for them, poor brutes.”

In bygone years she had been intolerably nervous before a first night. She had felt slightly sick all day and as the hours passed got into such a state that she almost thought she would have to leave the stage. But by now, after having passed through the ordeal so many times, she had acquired a certain nonchalance. Throughout the early part of the day she felt only happy and mildly excited; it was not till late in the afternoon that she began to feel ill at ease. She grew silent and wanted to be left alone. She also grew irritable, and Michael, having learnt from experience, took care to keep out of her way. Her hands and feet got cold and by the time she reached the theatre they were like lumps of ice. But still the apprehension that filled her was not unpleasant.

Julia had nothing to do that morning but go down to the Siddons for a word-rehearsal at noon, so she lay in bed till late. Michael did not come back to lunch, having last things to do to the sets, and she ate alone. Then she went to bed and for an hour slept soundly. Her intention was to rest all the afternoon; Miss Phillips was coming at six to give her a light massage, and by seven she wanted to be at the theatre. But when she awoke she felt so much refreshed that it irked her to stay in bed, so she made up her mind to get up and go for a walk. It was a fine, sunny day. Liking the town better than the country and streets more than trees, she did not go into the Park, but sauntered round the neighbouring squares, deserted at that time of year, idly looking at the houses, and thought how much she preferred her own to any of them. She felt at ease and light-hearted. Then she thought it time to go home. She had just reached the corner of Stanhope Place when she heard her name called in a voice that she could not but recognize.

“Julia.”

She turned round and Tom, his face all smiles, caught her up. She had not seen him since her return from France. He was very smart in a neat grey suit and a brown hat. He was tanned by the sun.

“I thought you were away.”

“I came back on Monday. I didn't ring up because I knew you were busy with the final rehearsals. I'm coming tonight; Michael gave me a stall.”

“Oh, I'm glad.”

It was plain that he was delighted to see her. His face was eager and his eyes shone. She was pleased to discover that the sight of him excited no emotion in her. She wondered as they went on talking what there was in him that had ever so deeply affected her.

“What on earth are you wandering about like this for?”

“I've been for a stroll. I was just going in to tea.”

“Come and have tea with me.”

His flat was just round the corner. Indeed he had caught sight of her just as he was going down the mews to get to it.

“How is it you're back so early?”

“Oh, there's nothing much on at the office just now. You know, one of our partners died a couple of months ago, and I'm getting a bigger share. It means I shall be able to keep on the flat after all. Michael was jolly decent about it, he said I could stay on rent free till things got better. I hated the idea of turning out. Do come. I'd love to make you a cup of tea.”

He rattled on so vivaciously that Julia was amused. You would never have thought to listen to him that there had ever been anything between them. He seemed perfectly unembarrassed.

“All right. But I can only stay a minute.”

“O.K.”

They turned into the mews and she preceded him up the narrow staircase.

“You toddle along to the sitting-room and I'll put the water on to boil.”

She went in and sat down. She looked round the room that had been the scene of so many emotions for her. Nothing was changed. Her photograph stood in its old place, but on the chimney-piece was a large photograph also of Avice Crichton. On it was written for Tom from Avice. Julia took everything in. The room might have been a set in which she had once acted; it was vaguely familiar, but no longer meant anything to her. The love that had consumed her then, the jealousy she had stifled, the ecstasy of surrender, it had no more reality than one of the innumerable parts she had played in the past. She relished her indifference. Tom came in, with the tea-cloth she had given him, and neatly set out the tea-service which she had also given him. She did not know why the thought of his casually using still all her little presents made her inclined to laugh. Then he came in with the tea and they drank it sitting side by side on the sofa. He told her more about his improved circumstances. In his pleasant, friendly way he acknowledged that it was owing to the work that through her he had been able to bring the firm that he had secured a larger share in the profits. He told her of the holiday from which he had just returned. It was quite clear to Julia that he had no inkling how much he had made her suffer. That too made her now inclined to laugh.

“I hear you're going to have an enormous success tonight.”

“It would be nice, wouldn't it?”

“Avice says that both you and Michael have been awfully good to her. Take care she doesn't romp away with the play.”

He said it chaffingly, but Julia wondered whether Avice had told him that this was what she expected to do.

“Are you engaged to her?”

“No. She wants her freedom. She says an engagement would interfere with her career.”

“With her what?” The words slipped out of Julia's mouth before she could stop them, but she immediately recovered herself. “Yes, I see what she means of course.”

“Naturally, I don't want to stand in her way. I mean, supposing after tonight she got a big offer for America I can quite see that she ought to be perfectly free to accept.”

Her career! Julia smiled quietly to herself.

“You know, I do think you're a brick, the way you've behaved to her.”

“Why?”

“Oh, well, you know what women are!”

As he said this he slipped his arm round her waist and kissed her. She laughed outright.

“What an absurd little thing you are.”

“How about a bit of love?”

“Don't be so silly.”

“What is there silly about it? Don't you think we've been divorced long enough?”

“I'm all for irrevocable divorce. And what about Avice?”

“Oh, she's different. Come on.”

“Has it slipped your memory that I've got a first night tonight?”

“There's plenty of time.”

He put both arms round her and kissed her softly. She looked at him with mocking eyes. Suddenly she made up her mind.

“All right.”

They got up and went into the bedroom. She took off her hat and slipped out of her dress. He held her in his arms as he had held her so often before. He kissed her closed eyes and the little breasts of which she was so proud. She gave him her body to do what he wanted with, but her spirit held aloof. She returned his kisses out of amiability, but she caught herself thinking of the part she was going to play that night. She seemed to be two persons, the mistress in her lover's embrace, and the actress who already saw in her mind's eye the vast vague dark audience and heard the shouts of applause as she stepped on to the stage. When, a little later, they lay side by side, he with his arm round her neck, she forgot about him so completely that she was quite surprised when he broke a long silence.

“Don't you care for me any more?”

She gave him a little hug.

“Of course, darling. I dote on you.”

“You're so strange today.”

She realized that he was disappointed. Poor little thing, she didn't want to hurt his feelings. He was very sweet really.

“With the first night before me I'm not really myself today. You mustn't mind.”

When she came to the conclusion, quite definitely now, that she no longer cared two straws for him she could not help feeling a great pity for him. She stroked his cheek gently.

“Sweetie pie.” (“I wonder if Michael remembered to have tea sent along to the queues. It doesn't cost much and they do appreciate it so enormously.”) “You know, I really must get up. Miss Phillips is coming at six. Evie will be in a state, she won't be able to think what's happened to me.”

She chattered brightly while she dressed. She was conscious, although she did not look at him, that Tom was vaguely uneasy. She put her hat on, then she took his face in both her hands and gave him a friendly kiss.

“Good-bye, my lamb. Have a good time tonight.”

“Best of luck.”

He smiled with some awkwardness. She perceived that he did not quite know what to make of her. Julia slipped out of the flat, and if she had not been England's leading actress, and a woman of hard on fifty, she would have hopped on one leg all the way down Stanhope Place till she got to her house. She was as pleased as Punch. She let herself in with her latchkey and closed the front door behind her.

“I daresay there's something in what Roger said. Love isn't worth all the fuss they make about it.”





Chapter 29


Four hours later it was all over. The play went well from the beginning; the audience, notwithstanding the season a fashionable one, were pleased after the holidays to find themselves once more in a playhouse, and were ready to be amused. It was an auspicious beginning for the theatrical season. There had been great applause after each act and at the end a dozen curtains calls; Julia took two by herself and even she was startled by the warmth of her reception. She had made the little halting speech, prepared beforehand, which the occasion demanded. There had been a final call of the entire company and then the orchestra had struck up the National Anthem. Julia, pleased, excited and happy, went to her dressing-room. She had never felt more sure of herself. She had never acted with greater brilliance, variety and resource. The play ended with a long tirade in which Julia, as the retired harlot, castigated the flippancy, the uselessness, the immorality of the idle set into which her marriage had brought her. It was two pages long and there was not another actress in England who could have held the attention of the audience while she delivered it. With her exquisite timing, with the modulation of her beautiful voice, with her command of the gamut of emotions, she had succeeded by a miracle of technique in making it a thrilling, almost spectacular climax to the play. A violent action could not have been more exciting nor an unexpected dénouement more surprising. The whole cast had been excellent with the exception of Avice Crichton. Julia hummed in an undertone as she went into her dressing-room.

Michael followed her in almost at once.

“It looks like a winner all right.” He threw his arms round her and kissed her. “By God, what a performance you gave.”

“You weren't so bad yourself, dear.”

“That's the sort of part I can play on my head,” he answered carelessly, modest as usual about his own acting. “Did you hear them during your long speech? That ought to knock the critics.”

“Oh, you know what they are. They'll give all their attention to the blasted play and then three lines at the end to me.”

“You're the greatest actress in the world, darling, but by God, you're a bitch.”

Julia opened her eyes very wide in an expression of the most naïve surprise.

“Michael, what do you mean?”

“Don't look so innocent. You know perfectly well. Do you think you can cod an old trooper like me?”

He was looking at her with twinkling eyes and it was very difficult for her not to burst out laughing.

“I am as innocent as a babe unborn.”

“Come off it. If anyone ever deliberately killed a performance you killed Avice's. I couldn't be angry with you, it was so beautifully done.”

Now Julia simply could not conceal the little smile that curled her lips. Praise is always grateful to the artist. Avice's one big scene was in the second act. It was with Julia, and Michael had rehearsed it so as to give it all to the girl. This was indeed what the play demanded and Julia, as always, had in rehearsals accepted his direction. To bring out the colour of her blue eyes and to emphasize her fair hair they had dressed Avice in pale blue. To contrast with this Julia had chosen a dress of an agreeable yellow. This she had worn at the dress rehearsal. But she had ordered another dress at the same time, of sparkling silver, and to the surprise of Michael and the consternation of Avice it was in this that she made her entrance in the second act. Its brilliance, the way it took the light, attracted the attention of the audience. Avice's blue looked drab by comparison. When the reached the important scene they were to have together Julia produced, as a conjurer produces a rabbit from his hat, a large handkerchief of scarlet chiffon and with this she played. She waved it, she spread it out as though to look at it, she screwed it up, she wiped her brow with it, she delicately blew her nose. The audience fascinated could not take their eyes away from the red rag. And she moved upstage so that Avice to speak to her had to turn her back on the audience, and when they were sitting on a sofa together she took her hand, in an impulsive way that seemed to the public exquisitely natural, and sitting well back herself forced Avice to turn her profile to the house. Julia had noticed early in rehearsals that in profile Avice had a sheep-like look. The author had given Avice lines to say that had so much amused the cast at the first rehearsal that they had all burst out laughing. Before the audience had quite realized how funny they were Julia had cut in with her reply, and the audience anxious to hear it suppressed their laughter. The scene which was devised to be extremely amusing took on a sardonic colour, and the character Avice played acquired a certain odiousness. Avice in her inexperience, not getting the laughs she had expected, was rattled; her voice grew hard and her gestures awkward. Julia took the scene away from her and played it with miraculous virtuosity. But her final stroke was accidental. Avice had a long speech to deliver, and Julia nervously screwed her red handkerchief into a ball; the action almost automatically suggested an expression; she looked at Avice with troubled eyes and two heavy tears rolled down her cheeks. You felt the shame with which the girl's flippancy affected her, and you saw her pain because her poor little ideals of uprightness, her hankering for goodness, were so brutally mocked. The episode lasted no more than a minute, but in that minute, by those tears and by the anguish of her look, Julia laid bare the sordid misery of the woman's life. That was the end of Avice.

“And I was such a damned fool, I thought of giving her a contract,” said Michael.

“Why don't you?”

“When you've got your knife into her? Not on your life. You're a naughty little thing to be so jealous. You don't really think she means anything to me, do you? You ought to know by now that you're the only woman in the world for me.”

Michael thought that Julia had played this trick on account of the rather violent flirtation he had been having with Avice, and though, of course, it was hard luck on Avice he could not help being a trifle flattered.

“You old donkey,” smiled Julia, knowing exactly what he was thinking and tickled to death at his mistake. “After all, you are the handsomest man in London.”

“All that's as it may be. But I don't know what the author'll say. He's a conceited little ape and it's not a bit the scene he wrote.”

“Oh, leave him to me. I'll fix him.”

There was a knock at the door and it was the author himself who came in. With a cry of delight, Julia went up to him, threw her arms round his neck and kissed him on both cheeks.

“Are you pleased?”

“It looks like a success,” he answered, but a trifle coldly.

“My dear, it'll run for a year.” She placed her hands on his shoulders and looked him full in the face. “But you're a wicked, wicked man.”

“I?”

“You almost ruined my performance. When I came to that bit in the second act and suddenly saw what it meant I nearly broke down. You knew what was in that scene, you're the author; why did you let us rehearse it all the time as if there was no more in it than appeared on the surface? We're only actors, how can you expect us to—to fathom your subtlety? It's the best scene in your play and I almost bungled it. No one in the world could have written it but you. Your play's brilliant, but in that scene there's more than brilliance, there's genius.”

The author flushed. Julia looked at him with veneration. He felt shy and happy and proud.

(“In twenty-four hours the mug'll think he really meant the scene to go like that.”)

Michael beamed.

“Come along to my dressing-room and have a whisky and soda. I'm sure you need a drink after all that emotion.”

They went out as Tom came in. Tom's face was red with excitement.

“My dear, it was grand. You were simply wonderful. Gosh, what a performance.”

“Did you like it? Avice was good, wasn't she?”

“No, rotten.”

“My dear, what do you mean? I thought she was charming.”

“You simply wiped the floor with her. She didn't even look pretty in the second act.”

Avice's career!

“I say, what are you doing afterwards?”

“Dolly's giving a party for us.”

“Can't you cut it and come along to supper with me? I'm madly in love with you.”

“Oh, what nonsense. How can I let Dolly down?”

“Oh, do.”

His eyes were eager. She could see that he desired her as he had never done before, and she rejoiced in her triumph. But she shook her head firmly. There was a sound in the corridor of a crowd of people talking, and they both knew that a troop of friends were forcing their way down the narrow passage to congratulate her.

“Damn all these people. God, how I want to kiss you. I'll ring you up in the morning.”

The door burst open and Dolly, fat, perspiring and bubbling over with enthusiasm, swept in at the head of a throng that packed the dressing-room to suffocation. Julia submitted to being kissed by all and sundry. Among others were three or four well-known actresses, and they were prodigal of their praise. Julia gave a beautiful performance of unaffected modesty. The corridor was packed now with people who wanted to get at least a glimpse of her. Dolly had to fight her way out.

“Try not to be too late,” she said to Julia. “It's going to be a heavenly party.”

“I'll come as soon as ever I can.”

At last the crowd was got rid of and Julia, having undressed, began to take off her make-up. Michael came in, wearing a dressing-gown.

“I say, Julia, you'll have to go to Dolly's party by yourself. I've got to see the libraries and I can't manage it. I'm going to sting them.”

“Oh, all right.”

“They're waiting for me now. See you in the morning.”

He went out and she was left alone with Evie. The dress she had arranged to wear for Dolly's party was placed over a chair. Julia smeared her face with cleansing cream.

“Evie, Mr. Fennell will be ringing up tomorrow. Will you say I'm out?”

Evie looked in the mirror and caught Julia's eyes.

“And if he rings up again?”

“I don't want to hurt his feelings, poor lamb, but I have a notion I shall be very much engaged for some time now.”

Evie sniffed loudly and with that rather disgusting habit of hers drew her forefinger across the bottom of her nose.

“I understand,” she said dryly.

“I always said you weren't such a fool as you looked.” Julia went on with her face. “What's that dress doing on that chair?”

“That? That's the dress you said you'd wear for the party.

“Put it away. I can't go to the party without Mr. Gosselyn.”

“Since when?”

“Shut up, you old hag. Phone through and say that I've got a bad headache and had to go home to bed, but Mr. Gosselyn will come if he possibly can.”

“The party's being given special for you. You can't let the poor old gal down like that?”

Julia stamped her feet.

“I don't want to go to a party. I won't go to a party.”

“There's nothing for you to eat at home.”

“I don't want to go home. I'll go and have supper at a restaurant.”

“Who with?”

“By myself.”

Evie gave her a puzzled glance.

“The play's a success, isn't it?”

“Yes. Everything's a success. I feel on top of the world. I feel like a million dollars. I want to be alone and enjoy myself. Ring up the Berkeley and tell them to keep a table for one in the little room. They'll know what I mean.”

“What's the matter with you?”

“I shall never in all my life have another moment like this. I'm not going to share it with anyone.”

When Julia had got her face clean she left it. She neither painted her lips nor rouged her cheeks. She put on again the brown coat and skirt in which she had come to the theatre and the same hat. It was a felt hat with a brim, and this she pulled down over one eye so that it should hide as much of her face as possible. When she was ready she looked at herself in the glass.

“I look like a working dressmaker whose husband's left her, and who can blame him? I don't believe a soul would recognize me.”

Evie had had the telephoning done from the stage door, and when she came back Julia asked her if there were many people waiting for her there.

“About three 'undred I should say.”

“Damn.” She had a sudden desire to see nobody and be seen by nobody. She wanted just for one hour to be obscure. “Tell the fireman to let me out at the front and I'll take a taxi, and then as soon as I've got out let the crowd know there's no use in their waiting.”

“God only knows what I 'ave to put up with,” said Evie darkly.

“You old cow.”

Julia took Evie's face in her hands and kissed her raddled cheeks; then slipped out of her dressing-room, on to the stage and through the iron door into the darkened auditorium.

Julia's simple disguise was evidently adequate, for when she came into the little room at the Berkeley of which she was peculiarly fond, the head-waiter did not immediately know her.

“Have you got a corner that you can squeeze me into?” she asked diffidently.

Her voice and a second glance told him who she was.

“Your favourite table is waiting for you, Miss Lambert. The message said you would be alone?” Julia nodded and he led her to a table in the corner of the room. “I hear you've had a big success tonight, Miss Lambert.” How quickly good news travelled. “What can I order?”

The head-waiter was surprised that Julia should be having supper by herself, but the only emotion that it was his business to show clients was gratification at seeing them.

“I'm very tired, Angelo.”

“A little caviare to begin with, madame, or some oysters?”

“Oysters, Angelo, but fat ones.”

“I will choose them myself, Miss Lambert, and to follow?”

Julia gave a long sigh, for now she could, with a free conscience, order what she had had in mind ever since the end of the second act. She felt she deserved a treat to celebrate her triumph, and for once she meant to throw prudence to the winds.

“Grilled steak and onions, Angelo, fried potatoes, and a bottle of Bass. Give it me in a silver tankard.”

She probably hadn't eaten fried potatoes for ten years. But what an occasion it was! By a happy chance on this day she had confirmed her hold on the public by a performance that she could only describe as scintillating, she had settled an old score, by one ingenious devise disposing of Avice and making Tom see what a fool he had been, and best of all had proved to herself beyond all question that she was free from the irksome bonds that had oppressed her. Her thoughts flickered for an instant round Avice.

“Silly little thing to try to put a spoke in my wheel. I'll let her have her laughs tomorrow.”

The oysters came and she ate them with enjoyment. She ate two pieces of brown bread and butter with the delicious sense of imperilling her immortal soul, and she took a long drink from the silver tankard.

“Beer, glorious beer,” she murmured.

She could see Michael's long face if he knew what she was doing. Poor Michael who imagined she had killed Avice's scene because she thought he was too attentive to that foolish little blonde. Really, it was pitiful how stupid men were. They said women were vain; why, they were modest violets in comparison with men. She could not but laugh when she thought of Tom. He had wanted her that afternoon, he had wanted her still more that night. It was wonderful to think that he meant no more to her than a stage-hand. It gave one a grand feeling of confidence to be heart-whole.

The room in which she sat was connected by three archways with the big dining-room where they supped and danced; amid the crowd doubtless were a certain number who had been to the play. How surprised they would be if they knew that the quiet little woman in the corner of the adjoining room, her face half hidden by a felt hat, was Julia Lambert. It gave her a pleasant sense of independence to sit there unknown and unnoticed. They were acting a play for her and she was the audience. She caught brief glimpses of them as they passed the archway, young men and young women, young men and women not so young, men with bald heads and men with fat bellies, old harridans clinging desperately to their painted semblance of youth. Some were in love, and some were jealous, and some were indifferent.

Her steak arrived. It was cooked exactly as she liked it, and the onions were crisp and brown. She ate the fried potatoes delicately, with her fingers, savouring each one as though it were the passing moment that she would bid delay.

“What is love beside steak and onions?” she asked. It was enchanting to be alone and allow her mind to wander. She thought once more of Tom and spiritually shrugged a humorous shoulder. “It was an amusing experience.”

It would certainly be useful to her one of these days. The sight of the dancers seen through the archway was so much like a scene in a play that she was reminded of a notion that she had first had in St. Malo. The agony that she had suffered when Tom deserted her recalled to her memory Racine's Phèdie which she had studied as a girl with old Jane Taitbout. She read the play again. The torments that afflicted Theseus' queen were the torments that afflicted her, and she could not but think that there was a striking similarity in their situations. That was a part she could act; she knew what it felt like to be turned down by a young man one had a fancy for. Gosh, what a performance she could give! She knew why in the spring she had acted so badly that Michael had preferred to close down; it was because she was feeling the emotions she portrayed. That was no good. You had to have had the emotions, but you could only play them when you had got over them. She remembered that Charles had once said to her that the origin of poetry was emotion recollected in tranquillity. She didn't know anything about poetry, but it was certainly true about acting.

“Clever of poor old Charles to get hold of an original idea like that. It shows how wrong it is to judge people hastily. One thinks the aristocracy are a bunch of nit-wits, and then one of them suddenly comes out with something like that that's so damned good it takes your breath away.”

But Julia had always felt that Racine had made a great mistake in not bringing on his heroine till the third act.

“Of course I wouldn't have any nonsense like that if I played it. Half an act to prepare my entrance if you like, but that's ample.”

There was no reason why she should not get some dramatist to write her a play on the subject, either in prose or in short lines of verse with rhymes at not too frequent intervals. She could manage that, and effectively. It was a good idea, there was no doubt about it, and she knew the clothes she would wear, not those flowing draperies in which Sarah swathed herself, but the short Greek tunic that she had seen on a bas-relief when she went to the British Museum with Charles.

“How funny things are! You go to those museums and galleries and think what a damned bore they are and then, when you least expect it, you find that something you've seen comes in useful. It shows art and all that isn't really waste of time.”

Of course she had the legs for a tunic, but could one be tragic in one? This she thought about seriously for two or three minutes. When she was eating outher heart for the indifferent Hippolytus (and she giggled when she thought of Tom, in his Savile Row clothes, masquerading as a young Greek hunter) could she really get her effects without abundant draperies? The difficulty excited her. But then a thought crossed her mind that for a moment dashed her spirits.

“It's all very well, but where are the dramatists? Sarah had her Sardou, Duse her D'Annunzio. But who have I got? ‘The Queen of Scots hath a bonnie bairn and I am but a barren stock.’”

She did not, however, let this melancholy reflection disturb her serenity for long. Her elation was indeed such that she felt capable of creating dramatists from the vast inane as Deucalion created men from the stones of the field.

“What nonsense that was that Roger talked the other day, and poor Charles, who seemed to take it seriously. He's a silly little prig, that's all.” She indicated a gesture towards the dance room. The lights had been lowered and from where she sat it looked more than ever like a scene in a play. “‘All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.’ But there's the illusion, through that archway; it's we, the actors, who are the reality. That's the answer to Roger. They are our raw materials. We are the meaning of their lives. We take their silly little emotions and turn them into art, out of them we create beauty, and their significance is that they form the audience we must have to fulfil ourselves. They are the instruments on which we play, and what is an instrument without somebody to play on it?”

The notion exhilarated her, and for a moment or two she savoured it with satisfaction. Her brain seemed miraculously lucid.

“Roger says we don't exist. Why, it's only we who do exist. They are the shadows and we give them substance. We are the symbols of all this confused, aimless struggling that they call life, and it's only the symbol which is real. They say acting is only make-believe. That make-believe is the only reality.”

Thus Julia out of her own head framed anew the Platonic theory of ideas. It filled her with exultation. She felt a sudden wave of friendliness for that immense anonymous public who had being only to give her opportunity to express herself. Aloof on her mountain top she considered the innumerable activities of men. She had a wonderful sense of freedom from all earthly ties, and it was such an ecstasy that nothing in comparison with it had any value. She felt like a spirit in heaven.

The head-waiter came up to her with a ingratiating smile.

“Everything all right, Miss Lambert?”

“Lovely. You know, it's strange how people differ. Mrs. Siddons was a rare one for chops; I'm not a bit like her in that; I'm a rare one for steaks.”
