致露西·巴菲尔德


亲爱的露西，

我为你写下这个故事，只是提笔时未曾想，你成长的速度超过我写故事的速度，你现在甚至已经过了读童话的年纪。等到此书付梓装订，你年岁愈增。但是他日某天，你会长到重新翻看童话的年龄。到那时，你可以将本书从高阁取下，掸去灰尘，告诉我你的读后感想。可能那时我年事已高，耳聋到听不清你说话，也不明白你讲的任何一个字，但我一直都是

深爱你的教父，

C. S.刘易斯





第一章　露西探看衣柜


从前有四个小孩，他们分别是：彼得、苏珊、埃德蒙和露西。当时，为了躲避战时空袭，这四个孩子被送到远离伦敦的乡村，住到一位老教授的房子里。故事就是在那里发生的。老教授的房子坐落在村子中央，离最近的火车站有十英里远，距最近的邮局也有两英里。老教授没有妻子，孤身一人。他和女管家麦克雷迪太太，还有三个仆人（分别是：艾薇、玛格丽特和贝蒂，不过她们在故事中出现的次数不多）一起住在这栋大房子里。老教授年纪很大，满头银发，把脸遮去了大半，孩子们几乎立刻就喜欢上了老教授。不过当他第一天晚上在门口迎接四个孩子时，他看上去有些奇怪。露西（四个孩子当中她年龄最小）一看见他便觉得有点儿害怕，而埃德蒙（他年龄倒数第二小）则是想笑，为了不让人发现他在笑，他只好不断假装擤鼻涕来掩饰自己。

第一天晚上，四个孩子向老教授道完晚安，就上楼休息了。刚一上楼，两个男孩就跑到两个女孩的房间里，大家开始聊了起来。

“咱们这回运气可真好。”彼得说，“接下来肯定特别好玩，这个老头会让咱们随便玩。”

“我觉得他是一个可爱的老头。”苏珊说。

“哎哟，别扯了！”埃德蒙说。他当时已经累了，但又假装自己不累，这总是把他弄得没有好脾气。“别再用这种口气说话了。”

“什么口气？”苏珊说，“再说了，你这时候本来就该在床上睡觉的。”

“现在又学妈妈的口气说话，”埃德蒙说，“你是谁啊，管我什么时候上床睡觉，你自己睡你的觉吧。”

“咱们是不是最好上床睡觉？”露西说，“咱们在这里说话，万一被别人听见，肯定会挨骂的。”

“不会有事的。”彼得说，“我给你们讲，住在这种房子里，是不会有人在意我们做什么的。总之，他们听不见我们说话。从这里走到楼下的餐厅差不多都要十分钟，而且中间还隔了那么多的楼梯和过道。”

“什么声音啊？”露西突然说。她之前从来没有住过这么大的房子，一想到那些长长的过道还有一排排门后的空屋子，她心里就发毛。

“傻瓜，不过是一只鸟儿。”埃德蒙说。

“是猫头鹰吧，”彼得说，“对鸟儿来说这里可是个好地方啊。现在我应该去睡觉了，要不明天我们好好转一转吧，这种地方可能什么都有。来的路上，你们有没有注意到那些山，还有树林？这里可能会有鹰、鹿，可能还会有隼。”

“还有獾！”露西说。

“还有狐狸！”埃德蒙说。

“还有野兔！”苏珊说。

不过，第二天清晨，天空竟然下起了雨，雨很大，一直下着，以至于抬头向窗外望去，既看不见远山，也看不见树林，连花园里的小溪也看不见。

“真是的！竟然下雨了！”埃德蒙说。孩子们刚和老教授一起吃完早餐，现在待在楼上一间房间里。房间是老教授为他们准备的，长而低矮，各有两扇窗户朝向两个不同的方向。

“埃德[1]，别抱怨啦，”苏珊说，“估计再过一个小时，十有八九雨就会停。我们这会儿也有很多东西可以玩，这里有一台收音机，还有许多书。”

“我不喜欢这些，”彼得说，“我要去探索这座房子。”

彼得的这个主意得到了大家的赞同，于是探索行动就这样开始了。一般这种好像永远也走不到尽头的大房子，里面总会有许多让人意想不到的地方。刚开始，他们试着打开几扇门，结果和大家想象中一样，门后不过是空荡荡的房间而已。不过，没过一会儿，他们走进一个长长的房间，里面挂满了画，还有一副盔甲；紧接着又进入一间房，墙面挂满了绿色装饰品，角落里摆放着一把竖琴；之后，大家伙下三个台阶，上五个台阶，然后爬了一小段楼梯，来到一扇门前，打开后发现背后是一个阳台；接着是好几个相通的房间，里面堆着好多书——大部分都是旧书，有的书比教堂里的《圣经》还要大。没过多久，他们将目光投向一个非常空的房间，房间里只摆放着一个大大的衣柜，就是那种门上嵌着穿衣镜的衣柜。除了这个衣柜和窗台上一只死反吐丽蝇，屋子里什么也没有。

“这里什么也没有！”彼得说完，大家就都往外走了，不过，露西并没有离开。她停在原地，因为她想打开衣柜看看里面有什么。虽然她估摸着这个衣柜多半上了锁，但还是觉得值得一试。令她大吃一惊的是，她没费什么力气就打开了衣柜。拉开衣柜门，只见两个樟脑丸滚了出来。

露西往里看，发现里面挂着几件大衣，多数是长款皮毛大衣。露西可是最喜欢皮毛大衣的味道和毛茸茸的感觉了，于是她立马走进去，钻到衣服中间，用脸摩挲衣服的表面。当然，她并没有关上衣柜门，因为她知道把自己关在衣柜里是一件特别愚蠢的事情。过了一会儿，她又往里面走了几步，发现第一排衣服后还挂着一排衣服。那里面光线很暗，几乎像是在黑夜里，她便伸直胳膊在前方摸索，以防脸撞到衣柜后壁。她向前走了一步，又迈了两三步，想着手指马上就要触到衣柜后壁的木板了，但是她一直都没有摸到。

“这可真是一个顶庞大的衣柜啊！”露西心里一边想，一边用手把柔软的皮毛大衣推向两边，好继续往里面走。随后，她注意到脚下传来嘎吱嘎吱的声音。“我估计这里还有很多樟脑丸吧？”她心里嘀咕着，弯下腰，伸手去摸，但她并没有摸到衣柜底部光滑的硬木板，反而感觉手指触到了软软的粉状物体，而且特别凉。“这可真是奇怪！”露西说着又往前走了一两步。

就在下一秒，她发现拂过脸庞和双手的不再是之前的柔软的皮毛大衣，变成了坚硬而粗糙的东西，还刺得人生疼。“这是怎么回事？感觉就像是树枝！”露西惊叫。然后，她发现前方亮着一盏灯。本来走几英尺就该摸到衣柜后壁的，可现在走了好长的距离还没到。此刻，露西感觉有东西飘在自己头上，冰冰的、软软的。片刻之后，她发现自己正站在一片暗夜笼罩下的树林中央，脚下是积雪，周围飘着雪花。

露西心里有点儿害怕，但与此同时，她又觉得好奇和兴奋。她扭过头往回望，透过黑黑的树林，还能看见打开着的衣柜门，甚至还瞥见了那间空房子——她出发的地方（当然，她并没有关上衣柜门，因为她知道把自己关在衣柜里是一件特别愚蠢的事情），那里看起来还是白天。“万一出了什么事，我随时都可以走回去。”露西心里想着。她开始踩着嘎吱作响的积雪往前走，穿过树林，朝着那盏灯走去。大约过了十分钟，她走到那盏灯跟前，发现原来那是一盏路灯。露西站在那里，凝视着路灯，心里在想为什么树林中央会有一盏路灯呢，还有自己接下来该做什么呢。就在这时，她听见一阵啪嗒啪嗒的脚步声向她靠近。不一会儿，她就看见一个长相奇特的人从树林中走出来，来到灯光下。

这个怪人只比露西高一点点儿，他头顶上撑着一把伞，伞上面落了一层白白的雪。自腰部往上，他和寻常人无异，不过他的腿长得像山羊腿（腿上的毛发黝黑发亮），而且他没有脚，只有一对羊蹄。另外，他还有尾巴，只不过露西一开始并没有注意到，因为那人为了不让尾巴拖在雪地上，将它搭在了举伞的胳膊上。他的脖子上围着一条红色的围巾，肤色也红通通的。他的脸较小，生得古怪但招人喜欢，下巴上有一小绺胡子，头发是卷的，额头两侧、头发中间各戳出一只角。我刚提到他的一只手撑着伞，另一只手臂携着几个棕色纸包。在雪地里拿着包裹，让人觉得他像是刚买完圣诞物品。这个怪人就是半人羊[2]，他看见露西时，吓了一大跳，手里的包裹全掉到雪地上了。

“天啊！”半人羊惊叫起来。





第二章　露西在衣柜里发现的东西


“晚上好。”露西说。不过，刚开始半人羊忙着捡地上的东西，没顾上回答，等他捡完包裹，才向露西鞠了一躬。

“晚上好，晚上好，”半人羊说，“不好意思——我不是要多嘴——不过要是我没猜错的话，你是夏娃[3]的一个女儿吧？”

“我叫露西。”露西回答，有点儿不明白半人羊的意思。

“那你真的是——请原谅我的冒昧——就是他们说的小女孩吗？”半人羊问道。

“当然，我是个女孩。”露西回答。

“那你真的是人？”

“当然，我是人。”露西说，她仍然有一些糊涂。

“真是的，真是的，”半人羊说，“你看我真傻！不过，我之前还真没有见过亚当之子，也没有见过夏娃之女。我太开心了，就是说——”说到这里，半人羊突然停住了，像是差点儿就要说漏嘴，但又及时想到，没把它说出来。“开心，开心，”他接着说，“请允许我介绍我自己，我叫塔姆纳斯。”

“很高兴认识你，塔姆纳斯先生。”露西说。

“哦，露西，夏娃之女……我再冒昧问一下，”塔姆纳斯先生说，“你是怎么来到纳尼亚的？”

“纳尼亚？那是什么？”露西说。

“这里就是纳尼亚王国，”半羊人说，“我们脚下的土地正是纳尼亚的国土，从那盏路灯开始，一直到东部海岸的凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿，都是纳尼亚的疆域。而你——你是来自西面的野树林吗？”

“我……我从空房里的那个衣柜来。”

“唉！”汤姆纳姆先生懊悔地说，“我要是小时候在地理上多花一点儿工夫，就肯定知道这些奇奇怪怪的国家了，现在要学也太晚了。”

“但我说的根本不是国家，”露西说，她差不多要哈哈大笑起来，“我说的那个地方就在后边——至少——我不确定，那里现在正是夏天。”

“可这时候，”塔姆纳斯先生说，“纳尼亚是冬天，这里进入冬天已经很长一段时间了。要是继续站在雪地里聊天，咱俩一会儿就都得感冒了。来自遥远的空间国的、夏日光辉永不消逝的衣柜之城的夏娃之女，不知你是否愿意与我一起喝个茶？”

“塔姆纳斯先生，谢谢你的好意，”露西说，“可我觉得我该回去了。”

“我家就在这附近，”半人羊说，“那里有熊熊燃烧的炉火——有吐司面包——还有沙丁鱼罐头——还有蛋糕。”

“那好吧，你真好。”露西说，“但是我不能待太久。”

“夏娃之女，那就请你挽住我的手臂，”汤姆纳姆先生说，“我为咱们撑伞，这是我们要走的路。好了，现在出发。”

于是，露西伸出手，挽住这个陌生生物的手臂，像是挽着一位自小就相识的朋友，走进树林里。

他们没走多远，道路就变得崎岖不平，石块四处散落，周围尽是起起伏伏的山丘。走到一个小山谷底时，塔姆纳斯先生突然拐了个弯，好像迎面就要撞上一块大得不同寻常的岩石似的。不过，到了最后，露西才发现，原来塔姆纳斯把她带到了一个山洞入口。刚进洞，明亮的木柴火光就晃得露西直眨眼睛。塔姆纳斯先生停住脚，用干净的小火钳从火堆中夹出一块燃烧着的木头，点燃了一盏灯。“茶一会儿就好。”他说着，随即把茶壶放到火堆上。

露西心想，自己可从来没有去过比这里更好的地方。小山洞干燥、整洁，洞壁的石头泛着红光，地上铺着地毯，还摆着一张桌子和两把椅子（“一把给我的朋友坐，一把给我。”塔姆纳斯先生说道），还有一个储物柜，摇曳的火光上方是壁炉架，上方是一幅画，画上是一只蓄着灰色胡须的老半人羊。山洞另一个角落里有一扇门，露西猜想那一定通向塔姆纳斯先生的卧室。洞内一面墙边靠着一个书架，上面摆满了书，诸如《西勒诺斯[4]的传奇人生和书信》《宁芙[5]及其生活》《人、僧侣和猎场看守人》《通俗传说研究》《人类是神话虚构吗？》等。在塔姆纳斯摆放茶具的时候，露西就在边上翻看书架上的书。

“好了，夏娃之女，过来享用吧！”半人羊说。

这真是美妙的茶点。塔姆纳斯煮了美味的褐色鸡蛋，一人一个，鸡蛋很嫩；有烤吐司面包，有的放了沙丁鱼，有的抹了黄油，有的抹了蜂蜜；还有裹着糖衣的蛋糕。当露西吃够，半人羊才开口说话，从神奇的传说到发生在树林的真实故事。他向露西描绘午夜舞会，那些生活在井里的宁芙女神和生活在树上的树妖都跑出来和半人羊跳舞；他给她讲述大家是如何长途跋涉追逐乳白色公鹿的，因为谁捉到那头白鹿，它就可以满足谁的愿望；他告诉露西他自己和野蛮的红色小矮人在深矿之中和森林地面下的岩洞里享用盛宴和寻宝的经历；他说起树木苍翠欲滴的夏天，年老的西勒诺斯会骑上胖驴子来这里拜访；偶尔巴克斯[6]也会来拜访，巴克斯一来，溪流里流淌的就不再是水，而是汩汩的红酒，整个树林狂欢起来，一直要持续好几个星期。“这里可不是一直都是冬天的。”他哀伤地加上一句。接着，为了让自己振奋起来，塔姆纳斯从储物柜上的一个盒子里取出一支外形奇怪又小巧的笛子，像是用稻草做成的。他开始吹奏起来。那笛子发出的乐音让露西在同一时刻里又想笑，又想哭，还特别困。她迷迷糊糊，一定是过了好几个小时，才突然惊醒过来，她说：

“哦，塔姆纳斯先生——我并不想打断你，我真的很喜欢你吹奏的曲子——可是，我现在必须回家了。我本来只打算在这里待一小会儿的。”

“现在已经来不及了，你知道的。”半人羊说。他放下笛子，悲伤地朝她摇着脑袋。

“来不及？”露西从椅子上弹了起来，感到很害怕。“你是什么意思？我现在就要回家，其他人得担心我是不是发生什么事了。”不过，她片刻之后又问道：“塔姆纳斯先生，到底发生了什么？”因为她看见半人羊的褐色眼眸里噙满了泪水，一颗颗泪珠顺着他的脸颊流下，滑过鼻尖落下来，最后他竟双手掩面号啕大哭起来。

“塔姆纳斯先生！塔姆纳斯先生！”露西十分难过地说，“别哭，别哭，这到底是怎么回事？你还好吗？亲爱的塔姆纳斯先生，告诉我到底怎么了？”但半人羊一直不停地抽泣，似乎心都要哭碎了，甚至当露西走过去环抱他，把自己的手帕递给他时，他也没有停止哭泣，只是接过手帕不断擦拭眼泪，直到手帕湿得不得了了，才用双手拧干，没过多久，露西脚下就被泪水浸湿了一片。

“塔姆纳斯先生！”露西一边冲着他的耳朵大喊，一边摇晃他，“不要哭了。赶紧停下来！像你这样强壮的半人羊真该为自己感到羞愧，竟然哭了这么久。你到底是为什么要哭啊？”

“呜——呜——呜——”塔姆纳斯先生呜咽地说，“我哭是因为我是一个可恶的半人羊。”

“我一点儿都不觉得你可恶，”露西说，“我觉得你是一只特别好的半人羊，你是我见过的最善良的半人羊。”

“不——不——如果知道我做过的事情，你就不会这样说了。”塔姆纳斯先生抽抽噎噎地说，“其实，我是特别坏的半人羊，我觉得自古以来，没有比我更可恶的了。”

“可是，你做了什么？”露西问。

“我尊敬的父亲，”塔姆纳斯先生说，“那边壁炉架上的就是他的画像，他绝对做不出这样的事情。”

“什么样的事情啊？”露西问。

“就是我做的事情，”半人羊说，“在白女巫手下做事。这就是可恶的我。我在白女巫手下工作。”

“白女巫？谁是白女巫？”

“哎，她就是掌控整个纳尼亚的人，就是她让这里只有冬天，永远都是冬天，还没有圣诞节，你想想看！”

“太可怕了！”露西说，“那她让你做什么呢？”

“最糟糕的就是这个，”塔姆纳斯先生深深叹了一口气，“我是她手下的绑匪，这就是我的真实身份。你看着我，夏娃之女。在树林里遇见任何一个可怜纯真的小孩子，即使他从未害过我，但我也会假装对他友好，带他到我的洞里，我这么做只是为了将他催眠，然后把他交到白女巫的手里。你相信吗，我就是这样的半人羊？”

“当然不相信，”露西说，“我确信你不会做出这种事情。”

“但是我已经做了，”半人羊说。

“这个嘛，”露西慢吞吞地说（因为她想表现出自己的真诚，又不想伤害塔姆纳斯），“这个确实不好，但你现在因为这件事情这么懊悔，我相信，你以后肯定不会再做这种事情啦。”

“夏娃之女，你还不明白吗？”半人羊说，“我不是说我之前做过这种事情，而是我正在做这件事，此刻正在做。”

“你什么意思？”露西脸色变得苍白，大声地说。

“你就是那个可怜纯真的孩子，”塔姆纳斯说，“我之前接到白女巫的命令，如果在树林里看见亚当之子或者夏娃之女，就要抓住他们，把他们交给白女巫。你是我遇见的第一个孩子。我刚刚假装成你的朋友，邀请你和我一起喝茶，而我一直在等你睡着，然后跑去告诉白女巫。”

“不，塔姆纳斯先生，你不会这样做的，”露西说，“你不会的，对不对？而且，而且你也不一定非得按她的命令行事。”

“如果我不这样做，”他说着开始哭起来，“她一定会知道这件事，到时，她会砍掉我的尾巴，锯掉我的角，拔掉我的胡须，然后挥动手中的魔杖，把我的美丽偶蹄[7]变成可怕的奇蹄[8]，就跟难看的马蹄一个样。要是这样她仍然盛怒难消，她就会把我变成石头雕像。我就会变成她那恐怖宫殿中唯一的半人羊，直到凯尔帕拉维尔的四尊宝座都座上有人——天知道那得等到什么时候，或者永远不会有那么一天也说不定！”

“塔姆纳斯先生，听你这么说，我真的很抱歉，但求求你放我回家吧。”

“放心，我会放你走的，”半人羊说，“我当然要放你走。我现在明白了，遇见你之前，我并不知道人类是什么样的。可我现在认识你了，我当然不会把你交给白女巫。不过我们得赶快离开这里，我会把你送到那盏路灯下。你应该还记得怎么回空间国，怎么回到衣柜之城的路吧？”

“我当然记得。”露西说。

“我们必须尽可能安静地离开这里，”塔姆纳斯先生说，“整片树林都分布着她的耳目，甚至有些树也是站在她那边的。”

他们俩站起来，顾不上收拾桌上的茶点，塔姆纳斯先生再次撑开伞，然后把手臂伸向露西，两人手挽手向外面的雪地走去。回去的路线和来时的路线完全不同。他们一路上小心翼翼，彼此不说一句话，用最快的速度走路，而且塔姆纳斯先生一直选择从最黑暗的地方走。当两人再次来到路灯下，露西悬着的心终于落了下来。

“夏娃之女，你知道怎么从这里回去吧？”

透过树林，露西用力分辨，终于发现远处有一点儿亮光，看起来就像是白日光一样。“是的，”露西说，“我看见衣柜门了。”

“那你赶快回家吧，”半人羊说，“还有——我之前打算害你，你能——能原谅我的过错吗？”

“哦，我当然会原谅你。”露西说。她真诚地握着半人羊的手，说：“我真心希望，你不会因为我惹上大麻烦。”

“夏娃之女，路上小心！”他说，“不知道我是否可以保留这块手帕？”

“当然可以。”露西说完，就用她双腿最快的速度朝着远处的光亮之处跑去。没过多久，她就感觉掠过身体的坚硬树枝消失了，取而代之的是皮毛大衣，脚下嘎吱作响的雪地也变成了衣柜底部的木板。突然之间，她发现自己冲出衣柜，回到了之前那间空屋子——整个探险开始的地方。她把身后的衣柜门关得紧紧的，然后一边喘气，一边看了看四周。外面还下着雨，还能听见过道里大家的喧闹声。

“我在这里，”她大声喊，“我在这里，我回来了，我没事儿。”





第三章　埃德蒙和衣柜


露西从那个空房间跑出去，来到外面的走廊上，见到了其他三个人。

“没事了，”她重复说道，“我回来了。”

“露西，你究竟在说什么？”苏珊问。

“啊？”露西惊讶地说，“难道你们刚才不是一直在找我吗？”

“你刚刚藏起来了，对不对？”彼得说，“可怜的露妹妹，自己藏起来，却没人注意到！你要是想让别人去找你，下次可得藏久一点儿！”

“可是我都离开这里好几个小时了。”露西说。

大家你看看我，我看看你。

“你疯了吧！”埃德蒙拍了下自己脑袋，说，“真是疯了！”

“露，你在说什么啊？”彼得问她。

“我说，”露西回答说，“刚吃完早饭，我就进入了那个衣柜，我已经走了好久好久了，这期间，我和别人喝了茶，还发生了好多事情。”

“露西，别傻了！”苏珊说，“我们刚从房间里走出来，刚才你还在里面。”

“她一点儿都不傻，”彼得说，“她只是编了个故事逗大家开心，露，是不是？再说，她怎么就不可以这样逗逗大家呢？”

“不是的，彼得，我没有编故事，”她说，“那是——那是一个魔法衣柜。衣柜里面有树林，下着雪，有半人羊和白女巫，那个地方叫纳尼亚，走，我们一起去看看。”

其他人根本不知该作如何想，而露西特别兴奋。大伙儿在她的感染下，都跟着她回到那个房间。露西冲在最前面，她猛地一把拉开衣柜门，大声说：“你们现在自己进去看！”

“呃，傻孩子，”苏珊一边往里面钻，一边用手拨开衣服，然后说，“这不就是个普通的衣柜嘛。瞧，这就是衣柜后壁呀。”

大家听苏珊这么一说，都把头伸进去，拨开两边的衣服，大家眼前看见的——包括露西看见的——就是一个普通得不能再普通的衣柜，里面没有树林，也没有雪，衣柜后壁就在那里，上面还挂着挂钩。彼得走进去，用手指关节敲了敲，确定衣柜后壁是实心的。

“露，这法子可真高明，”他说着从里面出来，“我得承认，你成功把大家骗了。我们几乎都相信你了。”

“可这根本就不是骗局，”露西说，“这是千真万确的事情，刚才和现在根本就是两个样，刚才不是这样的，我向你们保证。”

“露，别说了，”彼得说，“再说就有点儿过了。你和我们开玩笑，已经骗到我们了，现在你是不是该承认自己在说谎了？”

露西的脸变得绯红，想说点儿什么，但又不知道该说什么，最后哭了起来。

接下来几天，露西都闷闷不乐。其实任何时候，只要她肯承认一切都是自己图好玩瞎编的，大家很容易就会和好如初。但是，露西是一个非常诚实的女孩，她知道自己说的都是实话，所以没法走到大家面前，说自己在撒谎。其他人都以为她在撒谎，而且是很愚蠢的谎话，这让露西很不开心。年龄稍大点儿的两个孩子说露西撒谎并不是有意，但埃德蒙有时候很坏，在这件事情上他就是很坏。他对露西冷嘲热讽，不断问她是不是又在碗柜里发现了其他新的国家。这几天，天气都很好，大家从早到晚都待在室外，晒太阳、钓鱼、爬树，或是躺在石楠花丛里，露西本来可以玩得很开心，可因为这件事情，她根本没法从中享受到任何乐趣。每天都是这样，直到又一个雨天到来。

那一天，直到下午，天还没有放晴的迹象，大家决定玩捉迷藏。苏珊第一个蒙眼数数，其他人迅速跑去找地方藏起来。露西跑进那个放衣柜的房间里，她并不想藏在衣柜里，因为她知道如果那样做，只会让其他人再次提起那件令自己烦恼的事情。不过，她确实还想再去衣柜里面看一看，因为她也开始怀疑纳尼亚王国和半人羊是不是只是自己的一个梦而已。这座房子很大，构造也很复杂，到处都是藏人的地方，露西心想，自己先去衣柜里面看看，出来还有时间找其他地方躲起来。可她刚走到衣柜前，就听到外面走廊里传来了脚步声，她没有选择，只好跳进衣柜，掩上门。她并没有紧锁上门，因为她知道把自己锁在衣柜里是一件十分愚蠢的事情，即使这是一个魔法衣柜。

露西听见的是埃德蒙的脚步声，他走进那间屋子时，恰好看见露西消失在衣柜里。他当下决定跟过去——倒不是因为他觉得那是个藏起来的好地方，而是因为他想上前取笑露西想象中的王国。他拉开衣柜门，里面和平常并无二致，挂着大衣，散发着樟脑球的味道，静悄悄、黑乎乎的，不过他并没有看见露西。“她以为我是来捉她的苏珊。”埃德蒙自言自语道，“所以就安静地躲在后面。”他跳进衣柜，关上门，完全忘记把自己锁在衣柜里是一件多么愚蠢的事情。接着，他开始在黑暗里摸寻露西，心想用不了几秒钟就能抓到她，可一直没有找到她，这让埃德蒙很吃惊。于是，他打算打开衣柜门，透点儿光线进来，但是他找不到门在什么地方。这可不是埃德蒙喜欢的情况，他开始朝各个方向摸，甚至大叫起来：“露西！露！你在哪里？我知道你在这里。”

任凭埃德蒙大叫，也没有任何回应，他注意到自己的声音听起来很奇怪——并不像是在柜子里，倒像是在空旷的野外，他还感觉到异常冷。这时，他看见一处亮光。

“太好了！”埃德蒙说，“门肯定自己开了。”他完全忘记那天露西说她朝一盏灯走去的事情，他只以为是门自己开了。埃德蒙向那亮光处走去，但是他并没有走出衣柜，回到空房间里，而是发现自己正从大片茂密的冷杉的树荫走出，走到树林中央开阔处。

脚下是松脆干燥的雪，而树枝上的积雪更多。他的头顶上方是淡蓝色的天空，就像是冬日晴天早晨的天空一样。他望向前方，树干缝隙中，太阳刚升起。太阳红红的，阳光透彻。四周如此静谧，就好像他是这块土地上唯一的活物一样。树林朝各个方向无限延伸，但树丛间既没有一只知更鸟，也没有一只松鼠。埃德蒙打了一个寒战。

他这才记起来自己在找露西，同时也想起自己如何嘲笑露西口中那个“想象国度”，而现在的情况表明那并不是露西想象出来的。他以为露西一定就在附近，于是大声喊起来：“露西！露西！我也在这里——我是埃德蒙。”

四下里没有任何回应。

“我最近总是嘲笑她，她肯定生气了。”埃德蒙心里想。虽然他并不想承认错误，不过相比之下，他更不愿意孤零零一个人待在这个冷森森、静悄悄的陌生地方，所以他又开始喊。

“我说，露！对不起，我之前没有相信你。我现在知道你一直都是对的。快出来，我们和好吧。”

依旧没有任何回应。

“真是个小女孩，”埃德蒙自言自语，“生气了，还不愿意接受别人的道歉。”他又环顾一周，他实在是不喜欢这里，差不多打定主意回去了。就在这时，远处树林里传来一阵铃声。他听见声音越来越近，直到两头驯鹿拉着一辆雪橇进入视野。

两只驯鹿的体型和设得兰矮马[9]差不多大，它们身上的毛特别白，甚至连白雪与之相比，都不算白了。两只树杈一样的鹿角颜色绚丽，在阳光的照射下，就像是摇曳在火光中一样。两只驯鹿身上套着深红色皮革挽具，上面挂着铃铛。坐在御座上的是一个胖胖的小矮人，站起来估计也就三英尺高。他身披由北极熊皮毛制成的外套，头戴红色头巾，头巾顶上有一条长长的金色流苏。那大胡子都垂到了膝盖处，反倒起了毛毯的作用。不过，在小矮人身后略高处，在雪橇的正中央，却坐着一个与小矮人迥然不同的人——一个身材高大的女人，她比埃德蒙见过的任何女人都要高。这个女人也穿着白色的皮毛大衣，从脖子到脚都裹得严严实实的，头上戴着金冠，右手拿一根长长的金魔杖。细看她的脸，除了嘴唇是红色，其余都是白色的——不是单纯的苍白，而像是白雪、白纸或是糖霜那样的白。这是一张优美的脸，只不过透着骄傲、冷漠和严厉。

小矮人挥动鞭子，驾着雪橇从埃德蒙眼前疾驰而去，铃铛叮当作响，雪花向路两边飞扬，这场景煞是好看。

“停！”那个女人命令道，小矮人急忙拉住缰绳，动作如此快速，以致两只驯鹿两腿腾空，几乎跌坐下去。不一会儿，它们平复过来，站在那里一边咬着嘴里的嚼子，一边喘气。在寒冷的空气中，它们鼻子里呼出的热气像极了一缕缕轻烟。

“你是谁？”那个女人问，眼睛狠狠盯着埃德蒙看。

“我是——我是——我叫埃德蒙！”埃德蒙结结巴巴地回答。他不喜欢这样被别人盯着看。

那个女人眉头一皱。“见到女王，你就是这样行礼的吗？”她问道，看起来比之前更严厉。

“尊敬的女王，请原谅我，我并不知道您是女王。”埃德蒙说。

“竟然不知道我是纳尼亚的女王？”她大声喝道，“呵！你接下来就知道我们是谁了。我再问一遍——你是什么来历？”

“禀告女王，”埃德蒙说，“我不知道您是什么意思。我还在念书——至少之前是——现在是假期。”

“那你究竟是什么？”那个女人继续问，“是不是发育过头的小矮人，还把自己胡子剃掉了？”

“不是的，女王，”埃德蒙说，“我还没有长过胡子，我还是个男孩。”

“男孩！”她说，“你是说你是亚当之子？”

埃德蒙安静地站着，什么也没说。他此刻困惑不已，根本不明白这个问题是什么意思。

“不管你说自己是什么，我看你就是个傻瓜，”女王说，“我再问最后一次，如实回答，否则别怪我没耐心。你是人吗？”

“回女王，是的，我是人。”埃德蒙说。

“那请问，你是怎么进入到我的领土的？”

“回女王，我是从一个衣柜进来的。”

“一个衣柜？你说什么？”

“我——我打开衣柜门，然后就出现在这里了。”埃德蒙说。

“哈！”女王说，似乎是自言自语，而不是对埃德蒙说，“一扇门！一扇人类之门。我还没有听过这样的事情。这可能毁掉一切，不过还好，只是出现了一个，这个很好对付。”她一边嘀咕，一边从座位上站起来打量埃德蒙，她的两只眼睛似是闪着烈焰。而与此同时，她举起了手中的魔杖。埃德蒙感觉她即将做出可怕的事情，但自己似乎不能挪动脚步。当埃德蒙回过神来时，她好像改变了主意。

“可怜的孩子，”她用完全不同的语气说，“你看起来都快冻坏了！快过来，和我一起坐在雪橇上，披上我的披风，咱们聊聊天。”

埃德蒙一点儿都不喜欢这样的安排，但是他不敢拒绝。于是，他走过去，踏上雪橇，坐在她脚边，而女王则拉过自己的皮毛披风，把埃德蒙裹住。

“要不喝点儿热的东西？”女王说，“你想要喝点儿吗？”

“是的，女王。”埃德蒙回答说，他被冻得上下牙齿直打战。

女王从衣服里掏出一个小瓶子，看起来像是由铜制成，接着，她伸出手，从瓶子里倒出一滴液体，就滴在雪橇旁边的雪地里。埃德蒙看着那滴液体从空中落下，就像一颗钻石一样闪耀，一接触雪地，就发出嘶嘶的声音，然后一个镶满珍珠的杯子就出现在那滴液体滴落的地方，里面盛着热腾腾的饮料。那个小矮人马上端起那个杯子，笑着向埃德蒙鞠了一躬——并不友善地一笑，然后把杯子递给他。埃德蒙喝着热乎乎的饮料，感觉好多了，从头到脚都暖和起来。这是他之前从没有喝过的东西，甜甜的，有好多泡沫，还有一股奶油味。

“亚当之子，光是喝饮料，不吃东西，这怎么行？”过了一会儿，女王问，“你最想吃什么？”

“回女王，我想吃土耳其软糖。”埃德蒙说。

女王又往雪地上倒了一滴液体，那里立刻就出现了一个系着绿丝带的圆盒子。打开一看，里面竟然装着好几磅最好吃的土耳其软糖。每一块糖都很甜，连糖心也是甜的，埃德蒙从来没有吃过比这更好吃的土耳其软糖了。他现在已经很暖和了，而且还很满足。

在埃德蒙吃土耳其软糖的时候，女王一直在问他问题。一开始，埃德蒙还想着边吃东西边说话不礼貌，但他很快就忘记了，脑子里只想着尽可能把美味的土耳其软糖全都塞进肚子里，他越吃越想吃，从来没有思考过女王为什么会有这么多问题。在女王的询问下，埃德蒙说自己有一个哥哥、一个姐姐和一个妹妹，有一个妹妹已经来过纳尼亚了，还在这里碰见半人羊，不过除了他们四人，没人知道纳尼亚的事情。女王似乎对他有三个兄弟姐妹这一事实感到特别好奇，不断问到这一点。“你确定只有你们四人吗？”她问，“两个亚当之子，两个夏娃之女，不多不少就是四个人？”埃德蒙满嘴含着土耳其软糖，不停说：“是的，我之前告诉过你了。”也忘记加上尊称“女王”，不过女王此刻似乎并不在意这个。

最后，埃德蒙吃光了所有的土耳其软糖。他直直盯着空盒子，多么希望女王问他是否还要吃。也许，女王知道埃德蒙在想什么，因为她知道——虽然埃德蒙并不知道——这土耳其软糖被施了魔法，任何人只要吃一口，就会想要吃更多，如果有足够的糖，就会一直吃到自己死为止。不过，她并没有给埃德蒙更多的糖，而是对他说：

“亚当之子，我特别希望见见你的兄弟姐妹，你会把他们带过来见我吗？”

“我可以试试。”埃德蒙说，眼睛依旧盯着那个空盒子。

“因为，如果你再来见我——当然，得带上你的兄弟姐妹——我就会给你更多的土耳其软糖。我现在没法给你更多了，因为在这里，魔法只能用一次。不过在我的宫殿里，就是另外一回事了。”“为什么咱们现在不能去你的宫殿呢？”埃德蒙说。当他刚踏上雪橇时，埃德蒙还害怕自己被她载到不知名的地方，再也回不去，可现在他早就把当时的恐惧忘得一干二净。

“我的宫殿可是一个漂亮的地方，”女王说，“我敢肯定你会喜欢的，里面有很多间屋子，都装满了土耳其软糖。还有啊，我自己没有孩子，我想要一个优秀的男孩，把他培养成王子，等我去世后，他就是纳尼亚的国王。当他是王子的时候，他可以戴着金色的王冠，天天吃土耳其软糖，而你差不多是我见过的最聪明、最英俊的年轻小伙子，我觉得我可以把你培养成王子——有朝一日，你带其他人来见我的时候吧。”

“为什么现在不可以呢？”埃德蒙问，他的脸变得通红，嘴巴和手指都是黏黏的。尽管女王刚刚说了一堆赞扬他的话，但他看起来可既不英俊，也不聪明。

“噢！我要是现在带你去，”她说，“那我就看不见你的兄弟姐妹了。我很想见见你那些可爱的兄弟姐妹。你会当上王子，然后——以后会成为国王，这个你知道了，但你也必须有朝臣和王公贵族。我会封你哥哥为公爵，将你的姐妹封为女公爵。”

“他们没什么特别之处，”埃德蒙说，“而且，我可以找个时间把他们带过来。”

“啊，但是一旦你去了我的宫殿，”女王说，“你可能就会把他们都忘记，尽情享乐，也就不会再想去找他们了。你必须现在回你的国家，改天再来找我，和他们一起，明白吗？要是你一个人来，那是不行的。”

“但是我都忘记回去的路了。”埃德蒙哀求道。

“这很简单，”女王回答，“你看见那盏灯了吗？”她用魔杖一指。埃德蒙转过头，看见了一盏灯，就是在那盏灯下，露西遇见了半人羊。“顺着那方向一直往前走，就会回到人类的世界。现在往这边看——”她接着指向相反的方向——“告诉我，你能不能看见那边树林之上有两座小山。”

“我觉得我看见了。”埃德蒙说。

“很好，我的宫殿就坐落在那两座小山之间，所以，等你下次来，只要找到这盏灯，然后你就可以看见这两座小山。穿过树林，你就能走到我的宫殿。但要记住——你必须把其他三个带过来，如果你单独来，我一定会十分生气。”

“我会尽自己最大努力的。”埃德蒙说。

“对了，”女王继续说，“你不需要告诉他们我的事情。就把这当成你我之间的秘密，这样会更有意思，你说是不是？给他们一个惊喜。你只需要把他们带到那两座小山之间——你这么聪明的小伙子肯定能想到一个好借口，把他们带过去——等你到达我的宫殿，你可以说‘咱们去看看里面有没有人’或者其他类似的话，不过这样说最好了。如果你的妹妹见过这里的半人羊，她可能听说过一些关于我的奇怪故事——一些胡说八道的事情，她可能会害怕来见我，你知道的，半人羊什么话都能说出口，那现在——”

“求你了，求你了。”埃德蒙突然插嘴，“请给我一块土耳其软糖，让我在回家的路上吃，好吗？”

“不行，不行，”女王笑着说，“你必须等到下一次才能吃。”她一边说，一边示意小矮人开路，在雪橇消失之前，女王向埃德蒙挥手，大声说：“下次见！下次见！别忘记了！早点儿来！”

埃德蒙一直站在那里，傻傻望着雪橇消失的方向，直到听到有人叫他的名字。他回过身来，看见露西从树林的另一端向他跑来。“哇！埃德蒙！”她大声说，“原来你也进来了！这里很好玩，对不对？那现在——”

“好啦，”埃德蒙说，“我知道你是正确的，那确实是个魔法衣柜。如果你愿意，我会向你道歉。不过，这么长时间，你都上哪里去了啊？我一直在到处找你。”

“如果我知道你也进来了，我就会等你了。”露西说，她太开心，太激动了，以至于都没有注意到埃德蒙的语气很焦躁，也没有注意到他的脸又红又奇怪。“我一直在和亲爱的塔姆纳斯先生吃午餐，就是那个半人羊，他一切都挺好，他把我放走之后，白女巫并没有对他怎么样，所以他想白女巫并没有发现这件事，之后也没什么好担心的了。”

“白女巫？”埃德蒙问，“她是谁啊？”

“她实在太坏了，”露西说，“她自称为纳尼亚的女王，但她根本没有那个资格，所有的半人羊、树精灵、水仙女、小矮人和动物——至少他们当中那些好的——都恨她。她可以把人变成石头，还会做许许多多可怕的事情。就是她施了魔咒，纳尼亚才永远都是冬天——一直是冬天，还从来没有圣诞节。她出门就坐在由驯鹿拉着的雪橇上，头上戴着王冠，手里拿着魔杖。”

埃德蒙吃了那么多甜的土耳其软糖，本来就不太舒服了，听到露西把自己刚结交的女王说成一个危险的巫婆，他觉得更加难受，但是他现在最想的还是再次吃上那美味的土耳其软糖。

“谁告诉你白女巫的这些事情的？”他问露西。

“塔姆纳斯先生，就是半人羊。”露西回答。

“你不能总是相信半人羊的话。”埃德蒙说，想要表现出自己好像比露西了解得更多。

“是谁这么说的？”露西问。

“大家都知道啊，”埃德蒙说，“不信你随便去问谁。不过，这么站在雪地里多傻啊，我们回家吧。”

“好啊，走吧，”露西说，“噢！埃德蒙，我好高兴你也进来啦。现在我们两个都进来过了，其他人该相信纳尼亚的存在了，这实在是太好了！”

不过，埃德蒙心里暗想，这对露西来说是好事，而对自己来说可没啥好处。他这下不得不在其他人面前承认露西是对的，他很确信一点，其他人都会站在半人羊和动物那一边，但是他自己差不多算是站在女巫那一边了。他不知道自己该说什么，也不知道日后大家谈论纳尼亚的时候，自己该如何保守住他和女王之间的秘密。

这时候，两人已经走了很长一段路了，突然，他们感到自己被衣服包围着，而不再是树枝，很快两人就站在放衣柜的那间空屋子里了。

“我觉得，”露西说，“埃德蒙，你脸色看起来很糟糕，你没事吧？”

“我没事。”埃德蒙说，但这并不是实话，他觉得很难受。

“那好吧，”露西说，“我们去找其他人吧，有那么多事情要给他们讲！到时候，我们一起去里面探险，肯定会特别有趣！”





第五章　回到门的另一边


因为捉迷藏的游戏还在继续，露西和埃德蒙费了一点儿时间才把其他两人找到。最后大家在一起时（在那间摆着一副盔甲的长屋子里），露西脱口而出：

“彼得！苏珊！我说的都是真的，埃德蒙也看见了。真的有一个国家，我们可以穿过衣柜到那里去。埃德蒙和我都去过了，我们在里面的树林里遇见了彼此。埃德蒙，快告诉他们。”

“这是怎么一回事啊，埃德？”彼得问。

现在，到了这个故事最可恶的片段之一。一直到此刻，埃德蒙仍然感到不舒服，闷闷不乐，想到露西是对的，他就很烦躁，但他一直没想好该怎么回应。当彼得突然问他怎么回事，他立即决定要做自己所能想到的最卑鄙可恶的一件事——他决定让露西大失所望。

“埃德，给我们说说。”苏珊说。

这时，埃德蒙露出一副优越者的神情，就像他比露西大很多一样（其实两人就相差一岁而已），他窃声笑了笑，才说道：“哦！刚刚露西和我一直在玩游戏——假装她之前讲的衣柜里的国家是真的。当然了，我们只是闹着玩，那些都不是真实的。”

可怜的露西狠狠看了埃德蒙一眼，转身冲出了房间。

而埃德蒙心眼越变越坏，他心里得意自己刚赢得那么漂亮，紧接着又说开去：“她又来这一套！她到底怎么回事啊？小孩子就这点招人烦，他们总是——”

“嗨！”彼得怒气冲冲地对埃德蒙喊，“你别说了！自从露西开始讲衣柜的那些事，你就对她糟透了，现在你们都一起玩衣柜王国的游戏了，又把她给气走。我觉得你这么做完全就是故意伤害她。”

“但那全是胡扯！”埃德蒙说，他十分吃惊。

“的确是胡扯，”彼得说，“这点你说对了。我们离开家的时候，露西还好好的，一到这里之后似乎就变了，要么就是她脑子变古怪了，要么就是学会了撒大谎。不管她到底怎么回事，你今天嘲笑她，惹恼她，明天又和她玩游戏鼓励她，你觉得这样做有什么好？”

“我认为——我认为……”埃德蒙说，但他完全不知道该说什么。

“你根本就没想过这些，”彼得说，“你就是故意的。一直以来，你对比你小的人都很不好，之前在学校，我们就已经看见过了。”

“别吵了，”苏珊说，“你俩在这里争有什么用吗？我们还是去找露西吧。”

过了好一会儿，大家找到了露西，每个人都看得出来她哭过，这倒也不奇怪。大家知道这时候说什么都不管用。露西还是坚持自己所说的，她说：

“我不管你们怎么想，我也不管你们说什么。你们可以去告诉教授，或者写信给妈妈，做什么都可以。我知道我在那里见过半人羊——真希望自己可以待在那里不出来，你们都讨厌，讨厌死了。”

这是一个令人沮丧的夜晚。露西很痛苦，而埃德蒙开始感觉到事情并没按照他设想的那样进行。两个年纪大一点儿的孩子开始猜测露西是不是疯了。露西上床睡觉后，苏珊和彼得站在过道里，低声交谈着。

结果，第二天早上，两人决定去找教授，把一切都告诉他。“如果他觉得露西有什么不对，他会给爸爸写信的，”彼得说，“这件事我们处理不了。”于是，他们走去敲教授的书房门。“请进。”教授说。他起身给他们找椅子来坐，说将洗耳恭听。接着，他双手合十，仔细听两人讲，没有说一句话，直到两人把整个事情都说完。之后，教授并没有立即说话，很长一段时间的静默后，他清了清嗓子，说了一句大家都没有料到的话：

“你们怎么知道，”他说，“你们的妹妹说的就不是真的呢？”

“啊，可是——”苏珊开口，但又停住了。从教授的神情来看，谁都看得出来他很严肃。接着，苏珊定了定神，说：“但是埃德蒙说他们只是假装而已。”

“这就是问题关键所在，”教授说，“这里当然需要多做思考，还要细细思虑。比方说——如果你们允许我这样问——根据你们的经验，你们认为是你们的弟弟，还是你们的妹妹更可靠一些？我的意思是说，你们觉得谁更值得信赖？”

“这个就是很蹊跷的地方，先生，”彼得说，“到目前为止，我得说每次我都会更相信露西。”

“亲爱的，你怎么想呢？”教授转头问苏珊。

“嗯……”苏珊说，“总的来说，我和彼得想的一样，但是这次她说的——森林和半人羊那些故事——不可能是真的。”

“这些也不是我所能知晓的，”教授说，“但是我知道一点，一个你一直信赖的人，若要断言他欺骗别人，这不是一件小事，事实上，这是一件很严肃的事情。”

“我们在担心这可能不只是撒谎的问题，我们觉得可能露西脑子出了点儿问题。”

“你是说她疯了？”教授语气特别冷静，“这个嘛，很轻易就能判断。你只需要观察观察她，和她说说话，就能看出她是不是疯了。”

“可是——”苏珊想说什么，又停住了。她从来没想到一个成年人会像老教授这样说话，所以不知道该作何想。

“逻辑啊！”教授半是自言自语地说，“他们怎么不在学校教逻辑呢？这件事只有三种可能性。要么是你们的妹妹撒谎；要么是她疯了；还有一种可能就是她说的都是实话。你们知道她平时不会撒谎，而且很显然她不是疯的。就目前来看，除非还有其他证据出现，否则我们只能断定她说的是事实。”

苏珊认真地望着教授，从面部表情来看，她十分确信教授并没有和他们开玩笑。

“可是先生，这怎么可能是真的呢？”彼得问。

“你为什么这么说？”教授反问。

“因为，首先，”彼得说，“如果露西说的是真的，为什么不是每个人每次去衣柜都能找到那个国家呢？我是说，我们上次都跑进衣柜，发现那里什么也没有，当时露西也在，她也没有假装说有什么国家。”

“这说明什么呢？”教授问。

“这个嘛，先生，这说明即使一切是真的，它们也不是一直都存在的。”

“是吗？”教授说了这么一句，彼得更不知道该说什么了。

“可是时间对不上啊，”苏珊说，“即使真有那么一个国家，露西也根本没有时间去任何地方。我们刚走出房间，她就跟在后面跑出来了。前后相差不到一分钟，可她却假装自己离开了好几个小时。”

“这恰恰就是她的故事显得真实的原因。”教授说，“如果这座房子里面真有一扇门通向另一个世界（我应该提醒你们这是一座十分古怪的房子，甚至是我对它了解的也不多）——我觉得啊，如果她进入了另外一个世界，我并不会惊讶那个世界有自己一套独特的时间法则。那样来说的话，无论你在那里待多久，都不会占用我们这个世界的时间。从另一方面来说，我不觉得这个年纪的小女孩能够想出这样的故事来。如果她真的在说谎，那她就该躲在里面，等到一段合理的时间过去，再出来讲那个故事。”

“那先生，你是说，”彼得问道，“难道真的存在像这样的——就在某处，某个角落里——另外的世界吗？”

“没有什么是不可能的，”教授说着，取下自己的眼镜，一边擦镜片，一边自言自语道，“真不知道这些学校里都教些什么。”

“那我们怎么办？”苏珊问。她觉得这场谈话快偏离主题了。

“我亲爱的年轻女士，”教授突然抬起头看着他俩，神情十分严肃，“有一个办法，你们没有谁提出来，但是值得一试。”

“是什么？”苏珊问。

“我们各自管好自己的事就好了。”他说。三个人的谈话就这样结束了。

这之后，露西的日子好过很多。彼得注意到埃德蒙不再嘲笑露西，无论是露西还是其他人都不想谈起衣柜那件事。所以相当长的一段时间里，看起来似乎一切探险已经结束，但事实并非如此。

老教授的这座房子——甚至是他对它的了解也不多——十分古老，也很出名，全英国上下，曾有许多人慕名前来参观。它不仅被旅游指南提及，甚至还被载入历史。在这里发生过各种各样的故事，有的甚至比我现在讲的这个故事更加离奇古怪。每次观光团体到达后，请求参观房屋，教授都会应允，然后女管家麦克雷迪就会带领大家参观，给大家介绍墙上的画、屋里的盔甲，还有藏书室里的珍本。麦克雷迪太太不太喜欢小孩子，而且不喜欢在给游客讲述自己知道的东西时被打断，她在第一天早上就告诉彼得和苏珊（还有许多其他规定）：“请大家记住，无论何时，我带领游客参观，你们都不要出现在我的视线内。”

“说得好像咱们谁愿意浪费半个早上的时间，跟着一群陌生的大人走来走去似的！”埃德蒙听后这么说道，其他人和他想的一模一样。第二次探险正是由此开始的。

几天后的一个早晨，彼得和埃德蒙在房间里端详那副盔甲，想着能不能把它一块块卸下来。这时，两个女孩冲进房间里，大喊：“不好了！麦克雷迪太太带着一群游客过来了！”

“赶紧出去！”彼得说。四个孩子很快从房间远端的门跑出去了。但是，当大家跑出去后，先是跑进绿屋子，然后躲进藏书室。这时突然又听见前方传来说话声，大家意识到麦克雷迪太太带着游客从后面的楼梯上来了——而不是如他们料想那样，从前面的楼梯上来。之后，不知是他们乱了方寸，还是麦克雷迪太太成心想捉住大家，或者是这座房子沉睡的魔法开始复苏，要把大家引去纳尼亚。总之，他们走到哪里，麦克雷迪太太就带着一群人跟到哪里。最后苏珊说：“这群烦人的游客！看这里——让我们躲进放衣柜的房间，等他们走了再出去。没有人会跟着我们去那里。”但是，当大家跑进放衣柜的房间，说话声又在走廊上响起，接着是一阵摸索开门的声音，大家眼看门把正在转动。

“快进去！”彼得一边说，一边猛地拉开衣柜，“现在没有其他地方可以躲了。”于是，他们四个匆匆躲进衣柜。大家坐在黑暗处，喘着气。彼得将门拉过来掩上，但并没有关上门，因为他当然记得——每一个头脑正常的人都知道——永远永远不要把自己关在一个衣柜里。





第六章　进入树林


“我希望麦克雷迪能早点儿带这些人离开，”没过一会儿，苏珊说，“我快要被挤坏了。”

“再说这樟脑球的味道也太难闻了！”埃德蒙说。

“我猜这些衣服口袋里全都塞满了樟脑球，”苏珊说，“用来防虫的。”

“什么东西扎到我的后背了。”彼得说。

“你们觉不觉得冷？”苏珊问。

“既然你提到这个了，我得说还真是觉得有点儿冷。”彼得说，“等一下，而且还很湿，这地方怎么回事？我坐在一块湿湿的地方上，而且还越来越湿。”他吃力地站起身来。

“我们出去吧，”埃德蒙说，“他们都走光了。”

“天——啊——！”苏珊突然大叫一声，大家都问她发生什么了。

“我是靠着一棵树坐的，”苏珊说，“你们看！那边有亮光。”

“哎呀！还真是，”彼得说，“看那边——还有那里，到处都是树木，湿湿的东西原来是雪。天啊，我觉得我们进入露西所说的树林里了。”

现在可没有弄错，四个人正站在冬季的树林里，这里正是白天，大家眨着眼，你看看我，我看看你。在他们身后，大衣还挂在衣钩上；在他们眼前，却是覆盖着白雪的树林。

彼得立刻转向露西。

“我为之前没有相信你道歉，”他说，“对不起，我们可以握握手，然后和好吗？”

“当然！”露西说，然后和彼得握了握手。

“那现在，”苏珊说，“我们接下来做什么去呢？”

“做什么？”彼得反问道，“嘿，当然是去探索这片树林啦。”

“咳！”苏珊咳嗽一声，跺着脚说，“太冷啦！我们要不穿点儿衣服再去？”

“那些不是我们的衣服啊。”彼得有点儿拿不定主意。

“我觉得没有人会在意的，”苏珊说，“我们又不是要把它们带出这座房子，我们甚至不会把它们拿到这个衣柜以外的地方去。”

“我倒没有想到这点，苏，”彼得说，“现在被你这么一说，我明白了。衣服本来在衣柜里，只要把衣服放到衣柜，就不会有人说你偷走衣服了，而且我觉得这整个国家就在衣柜当中。”

他们立即实施了苏珊这个明智的计划。这些衣服对他们来说都太大了，都拖到脚后跟，虽说穿的是外套，看起来更像是披着皇室睡袍。不过，穿上衣服后大家马上觉得暖和了许多，而且都觉得彼此穿上新衣服很好看，和眼下的风景也更相配。

“我们可以假装自己是北极探险者。”露西说。

“不用假装，这已经很让人兴奋了。”彼得说。他开始在前面领路，带大家向树林里走去。此时头顶上方，飘着阴沉沉的云，估计天黑之前还会下雪。

“我说，”埃德蒙说，“要是我们想去灯柱那里，是不是该往左边走啊？”他一时忘记了自己必须假装从来没有来过这里。话一出口，他才意识到秘密泄露了。大家都停了下来，盯着他。彼得吹了一声口哨。

“所以你之前确实来过这里，”他说，“上次露说她在里面碰见你——结果你说她在撒谎。”

现场陷入静寂。“呵，你才是那个最恶毒的小坏蛋——”彼得耸了一下肩，就说了这么一句。好像确实也无须再多说什么，四人重新踏上探索之旅，只是埃德蒙默念着：“你们这群自以为是的假正经，我一定会让你们为此付出代价。”

“我们到底要去哪里呢？”苏珊问，她主要想换个话题。

“我觉得露应该来做领队，”彼得说，“老天都知道，她是当之无愧的人选。露，你想带我们去哪里？”

“那我们去塔姆纳斯先生那里怎么样？”露西说，“就是那个很友好的半人羊，我之前跟你们说过。”

大家都同意这个提议，于是踏步快速前行。露西确实是一个好领队，最开始她还不确信自己能找到正确的路，不过之后她认出一棵外貌奇特的树，又看见一截树桩，跟着这些“指路牌”，她带大家走过崎岖不平的路段，经过小峡谷，最后来到了塔姆纳斯先生的门口。然而，一场可怕的意外正等待着他们。

塔姆纳斯的门已脱离门框，被砸成了碎片，洞里又黑又冷，一股潮气扑鼻而来，还夹杂一股好多天无人居住的味道。雪花从门口飘入，混杂着一些黑色的东西堆积在地上，细眼一看才发现那是烧黑的木棍和火堆的灰烬。这一看就是有人冲进去把火堆踩灭的。地面铺着一些瓷器碎片；半人羊父亲的画像也被人用刀割成碎条，散落在地上。

“这完全是大扫荡！”埃德蒙说，“来者肯定不善。”

“这是什么？”彼得停住脚。他注意到一张纸被钉子穿透地毯钉在地上。

“上面有写什么吗？”苏珊问。

“嗯，我觉得有。”彼得说，“但是这里面光线太暗，我看不清。我们到外面去看吧。”

大家都走出洞，围着彼得，听他念纸上的字：

此前洞中居住者，半人羊塔姆纳斯，已被收押候审，被控罪名如下：叛国罪——背叛纳尼亚女王、凯尔帕拉维尔城堡女主人、孤岛女皇：嘉蒂斯女王陛下；庇护女王敌人；窝藏奸细；勾结人类。

签字：秘署统领

毛格林姆

女王陛下万岁！

听后，大家面面相觑。

“我不知道自己会不会喜欢这个地方。”苏珊说。

“露，谁是女王？”彼得问，“你知道她吗？”

“她根本就不是真正的女王，”露西回答，“她是一个可怕的女巫，是白女巫。这里的每个人——森林里的人们——全都讨厌她。她对这个国家施了魔法，所以这里永远都是冬天，永远都没有圣诞节。”

“我——我不知道是否还有必要在这里待下去，”苏珊说，“我是说这里看起来一点儿也不安全，估计在这里也不好玩，而且现在越来越冷了，我们又没有带吃的出来。要不我们回去吧？”

“啊，可是我们不能回去，不能就这么回去，”露西忽然说话，“难道你没明白吗？我们不能回去，不可能看到这一切之后还离开。都是因为我，可怜的半人羊才惹上这个麻烦。他让我躲过白女巫，是他给我指路，把我送回去的。这就是为什么那张纸上会说他庇护女王敌人，勾结人类’，我们一定要设法营救他。”

“我们可是什么都能做的，”埃德蒙讥讽道，“即便是我们什么东西都没有吃。”

“你闭嘴！”彼得还在生埃德蒙的气，他问苏珊：“苏珊，你怎么想的？”

“我有一种可怕的感觉，我觉得露说的是对的，”苏珊说，“我不想往前再走一步，我宁愿我们没有来过这里，可我又觉得我们应该试着为那个什么先生做点儿什么，我是说半人羊。”

“我也是这么觉得，”彼得说，“我现在担心的是我们没有随身带食物，我本来想提议回去从食物贮藏室里拿点儿东西出来，可问题是从这里出去之后，就不一定还进得来。我看我们最好还是现在就上路吧。”

“我同意。”两个女孩说。

“要是我们知道这个可怜的半人羊被关在哪里就好了。”彼得说。

大家正在想接下来该怎么办，露西突然大声叫道：“看那里！有一只知更鸟，胸前一团红色的那个。这是我在这里见到的第一只鸟。嘿！——你们说纳尼亚的鸟会说话吗？感觉它有话对我们说一样。”然后露西转向那只鸟，对它说话：“请问，你能告诉我们半人羊塔姆纳斯被带到哪里去了吗？”她一边说，一边向鸟儿靠近了一步，那只鸟一下就飞走了，不过没有飞远，而是停在旁边的一棵树上。它认真地看着他们，仿佛明白他们在说什么。大家不由自主地跟着鸟儿往前走了一两步，这时鸟儿又飞走了，停在另一棵树上，认真看着他们。（你找不出比它的胸脯更鲜艳、眼睛更明亮的知更鸟了。）

“你们知道吗，”露西说，“我真觉得它是特意让我们跟着它走的。”

“我也觉得它是这个意思，”苏珊说，“彼得，你怎么看呢？”

“嗯，我们最好试一下，跟过去看看。”彼得回答。

那只知更鸟仿佛完全明白这一切，它从一棵树飞到另一棵树上，一直在前面，但一直保持几码距离，所以大家很容易跟随它。就这样，它带着一行人一直往前走下山坡。每当它停在树枝上时，树上的雪就会哗啦啦往下掉。过了一会儿，头顶的乌云散去，冬日的太阳露出来，周围的白雪变得十分耀眼。他们就这样跟着那只鸟走了大概半个小时，两个女孩走在前面，两个男孩走在后面。埃德蒙对彼得说：“我知道你趾高气扬，但要是还没有到不愿和我讲话的程度，我有话对你说，你最好听一下。”

“什么事？”彼得问他。

“嘘！不要这么大声，”埃德蒙说，“惊到那两个女孩没什么好处。你意识到我们在做什么了吗？”

“什么意思？”彼得压低声音问道。

“我们跟着这只鸟前行，可我们对它一无所知。我们怎么知道这只鸟站在哪一边？是好是坏？万一它把我们带进陷阱呢？”

“你这样想太邪恶了，这可是知更鸟——你知道的啊！我在故事里读到的知更鸟都很善良，我相信知更鸟不会站在坏人那边。”

“即使说到这个，哪一边是正义的呢？我们怎么知道半人羊就是好的，女王（是，我知道据说那是个女巫）就是邪恶的一边呢？我们真的不了解他们。”

“半人羊救过露西。”

“他说他救过，可是我们怎么知道是不是这样？而且还有件事情，还有谁记得回家的路吗？”

“糟糕！”彼得说，“我倒没想到这点。”

“看来晚饭也吃不成了。”埃德蒙说。





第七章　和海狸的一天


正当男孩在后面窃窃私语时，前面两个女孩突然“啊”地大叫一声，然后停下脚步。

“那只知更鸟，”露西大声喊，“鸟儿飞走了！”那只鸟真的飞出了大家的视线。

“现在我们怎么办？”埃德蒙说着看了彼得一眼，那眼神差不多是在说“看吧，我早告诉你了”。

“嘘！看那边！”苏珊说。

“什么？”彼得问。

“那边树丛间有东西在向左边移动。”

大家凝神望过去，此时没有一个人觉得自在。

过了一会儿，苏珊说：“又在动了。”

“我刚才也看见它动了，”彼得说，“那东西还在那里，只是跑到大树后面去了。”

“那是什么？”露西问，尽量不表现出自己的紧张。

“不管是什么，”彼得说，“它在躲着我们，肯定是不想让我们看见的东西。”

“我们回家吧。”苏珊说。这时，尽管没有谁说出来，但大家都意识到一个事实，就是上一章最后埃德蒙悄声提醒彼得的那一点：他们迷路了。

“像什么呀？”露西问。

“它——它像是一种动物，”苏珊回答，过了一会儿，“看！看！快看，又在动了。”

这回大家都看见一张毛茸茸、长着胡须的脸出现在一棵树后。不过这次，他并没有即刻退缩，反而举起爪子放在嘴边，就像人类想要别人安静时，把手放在嘴边一样。接着，那个动物又消失了。大家全都站在原地，不敢呼吸。

过了一会儿，那个陌生的动物又从树丛中冒了出来，他环视四周，好像害怕有人在监视他一样，然后说：“别出声。”他站在浓密的树丛之间，做了一个让大家跟上他的手势，紧接着又消失了。

“我知道那是什么了，”彼得说，“那是只海狸，我看见他的尾巴了。”

“他想让我们跟过去，”苏珊说，“而且他还警告我们不要发出声音。”

“我知道，”彼得说，“问题是我们要不要跟过去。露，你怎么想？”

“我觉得那只海狸是善良的。”露西说。

“是的，可是我们怎么才能知道呢？”埃德蒙说。

“我们要不要冒次险？”苏珊说，“在这里站着也不是办法，而且我有点儿想吃晚饭了。”

这时候，海狸再次从树后冒出脑袋，热切地打手势召唤大家。

“走，”彼得说，“我们试一试。大家都跟紧点儿。如果最后证明海狸是敌人，我们这么多人也肯定能对付他。”

于是，四个孩子都聚拢起来，然后朝那棵树走去，果真就在树后找到了海狸，但他又缩回去了，并用粗哑的声音低声说：“进来一点儿，都进来。就是这里好了，我们在空旷的地方不安全。”

他把大家带到一个黑暗的地方，周围有四棵树，挨得很近，树干彼此交叉，雪花没法掉下来，所以还能看见脚下褐色的土壤和松针，这时海狸才开口和大家说话。

“你们是不是亚当之子和夏娃之女？”海狸问。

“我们是其中几个。”彼得回答。

“嘘——”海狸说，“请不要说那么大声。就算在这里咱们一点儿也不安全。”

“为什么？你在害怕谁呢？”彼得问，“这里除了我们，谁也没有啊。”

“有那么多树啊。”海狸说，“它们一直在监听，好多树都是站在我们这边的，但是还是有站在她那边的，会出卖我们。你们知道我说的是谁吧？”他边说边点了几下头。

“说到谁站谁那边，”埃德蒙说，“我们怎么知道你是敌是友？”

“海狸先生，我们并不是有意冒犯，”彼得补充道，“毕竟咱们都互相不认识。”

“说得对，说得对，”海狸说，“这是我的信物。”说完，他举起一个白色的小东西到大家面前。大家都吃惊地看着那个信物，直到露西说：“啊！当然！这是我的手绢——是我给可怜的塔姆纳斯先生的。”

“这就对了。”海狸说，“可怜的半人羊，被逮捕之前，他听到了一些风声，便把这个提前交给了我。他说万一有什么事发生，就让我一定在这里见你，然后带你去——”说到这里，海狸沉默了，严肃地点了一两下头。接着，他示意大家尽量靠近，孩子们靠拢过来，最后脸都碰到海狸的胡须了，海狸很小声地说——

“听说阿斯兰要来了，可能已经在这块土地上了。”

这可激起了大家的兴趣。和读到这里的你一样，他们四人当中，没有一个人知道阿斯兰是谁。但是，当海狸说到这个名字的时候，大家都感觉特别不一样。那种感觉就像有的时候你做梦，梦见有人对你说了些你不明白的东西，但是在梦里，你觉得那意义非凡，也许是很可怕的东西，让你的梦变成噩梦；也许是一些无法用语言描述的美好的东西，让你的梦十分香甜，永远都忘不掉，一直希望能够再做那样的梦。现在就似是这种情形。听到阿斯兰的名字，每个孩子内心都有不同的感受。埃德蒙心里涌起一阵神秘的惧惮；彼得突然觉得勇气大增，想去探险；苏珊觉得好像被一股甜美的味道或是美妙的音乐围绕着；而露西的感觉则像是你早上起床的时候，突然意识到今天是假期的第一天或者是夏天的第一天。

“那塔姆纳斯先生怎样了？”露西问，“他在哪里？”

“嘘——”海狸说，“我们不在这里说了。我必须带你们去一个真正能够谈话的地方，并且还能享用晚餐。”

现在除了埃德蒙，所有人都十分信任海狸。听到“晚餐”这个词，每个人，包括埃德蒙，都很高兴。

因此，大家急忙跟在这个新朋友后面往前走。海狸带着大家快速前进，而且总是从森林里树木最茂密的地方走，就这样走了一个多小时。每个人都非常累非常饿。突然，眼前的树变得越来越稀疏，路变成陡峭的下坡。过了一分钟，大家走出树林，来到广阔的天空下（太阳还在天上照耀），大家往下看到一处别致的景观。

他们此刻站在一条狭窄而陡峭的峡谷边，峡谷最底部是一条宽广的大河——如果没有结冰，现在河水一定向前奔腾着。就在大家下方，有一条横跨大河的堤坝，大家看到堤坝时，都忽然想起海狸特别喜欢在水边修坝，大家都相信这一座就是他们的新朋友——海狸先生筑起来的。他们还注意到此时海狸脸上露出的谦虚之情——正如你参观一座花园或读一则故事时，建造、书写之人脸上的表情。所以当苏珊感叹“好漂亮的堤坝啊”时，海狸并没有说“嘘”，而只是谦虚礼貌地说：“哪里，哪里，不值一提的小事！其实都还没有完工哩。”

堤坝之上，本该是一个深水池，现在是冬天，自然是被一层墨绿色的冰覆盖。堤坝之下，很低的地方，有更多的冰，但不似上面那层冰表面光滑，而是呈波浪形，还能看见冰块中的小气泡，这是急流的水浪被瞬间冻住的结果。河水流过堤坝以及水花喷溅的地方，结了一根根闪闪发亮的冰柱，整座堤坝看起来就像是被花朵、花环和彩带点缀了一番，又像被纯净的白糖装饰过一样。在堤坝正中，一座小小的、可爱的房子坐落其上，形状像是一个大蜂窝，屋顶上一个小孔冒出袅袅炊烟。看到这样的景象（尤其是当你饥肠辘辘时），你立刻就会想到里面有人做饭，想到这，就会觉得现在比之前更饿了。

这就是大家注意到的大致情形，但是埃德蒙还看见了别的东西。就在河道稍微靠下一些的地方，有另外一条小溪从另一条小山谷流出，与之汇合。往那条山谷望去，埃德蒙看见了两座小山，他几乎可以确定那就是上次他在灯柱那里与白女巫分别时，白女巫指给他的那两座小山。埃德蒙心里想，在那两座小山之间，一定就是她的宫殿了，离这里大约一英里远。他想着美味的土耳其软糖，想着自己要成为国王（他在心里默念：“我真想看看彼得知道我成为国王会是什么反应。”），于是脑子里就冒出可怕的念头。

“到了，”海狸先生说，“看来我的太太正在等待大家的到来。跟着我走，要小心点儿，别滑倒了！”

堤坝顶部足够宽，在上面行走不成问题，但对人来说——在上面走起来却没那么舒服。因为上面全结了冰，虽然一侧和冰封的池塘一般高，但另一面和下游水位之间落差很大，看起来很是吓人。海狸先生领着排成一列的队伍往前走，直接往堤坝中间走去，站在那里，往上看有一条长长的路，往下看也有一条长路沿河而下。大家走到堤坝正中，停在一座屋子的门前。

“我们到了，太太，”海狸先生说，“我找到他们了。这就是亚当之子和夏娃之女。”说着，把大家都带进屋里。

一进屋，露西就听到嗒嗒—嗒嗒的声音，她随即看到角落里一只慈祥的雌海狸嘴咬一根线坐在缝纫机前忙碌，声音就是从那里传来的。看到孩子们走进来，她就停下手中的工作，起身迎接大家。

“终于盼到你们了！”海狸太太说着，伸出自己满是皱纹的、苍老的爪子，“谢天谢地！我还是活着等到了这一天！锅里的土豆已经熟了，热水壶也响了。我说海狸先生，你一定要给我们捉几条活鱼回来。”

“那是当然。”海狸先生说着就出门了（彼得也跟了出去）。海狸先生穿过结满冰的深水池，来到一个冰孔，海狸先生每天都会来这里，并用斧子砸开冰块。他俩带着一个水孔。海狸先生轻轻坐在冰洞边上（他看上去似乎并不介意天气这么冷），认真注视着洞内，突然把爪子伸进去，瞬间就抓出一条漂亮的鳟鱼。接着，他运用相同的方法，一连抓了好几条鱼。

与此同时，女孩们正在帮海狸太太做事：往热水壶里加水，摆桌子，切面包，把盘子放进烤箱加热，从角落里的酒桶中给海狸先生接了一大罐啤酒备着，摆上煎锅，热好油。露西觉得海狸一家的房屋小巧舒适，不过和塔姆纳斯的岩洞完全不一样，这里没有书和画像，倚壁而设的两个铺位便是他们睡觉的地方，就像轮船上的床铺一样。屋顶上垂吊着火腿和串串洋葱。墙边摆着长筒橡胶靴、油布外套、短斧、大剪刀、铁锹、泥铲、装水泥灰浆的东西、钓鱼竿和麻袋。虽然桌子上铺的桌布十分整洁，但也很粗糙。

就在锅里的热油滋滋响的时候，彼得和海狸先生提着桶回来了。海狸先生在外面就把鱼破肚并清洗干净了。此刻，油锅里正炸着刚捉回来的鱼，你可以想象房子里散发着的味道是如何鲜美，而一群肚子咕咕叫的孩子又是多么希望马上享用这些鱼儿；想想在海狸先生说“现在差不多可以开饭”之前，他们肚子该多么饿啊。苏珊沥干土豆，然后放回炉子边的空锅里烤干，露西则帮着海狸太太烧鳟鱼。于是，没过一会儿，就到吃饭时间了，大家搬着各自的凳子（除放在炉火边的海狸太太那把特殊的摇椅外，家里所有的凳子都是三脚凳）围到桌子前。桌上有一大罐乳脂牛奶，是给孩子们喝的（海狸先生喝的是啤酒），桌子中央放着一大块深黄色的黄油，任大家取来配着土豆吃，所有的孩子都认为——我也同意——没有什么比淡水鱼更美味的了，尤其是它们半小时前还在水里游，现在刚从锅里盛出来半分钟。等大家吃完鱼，海狸太太出乎大家意料地从烤箱里拿出一个热气腾腾的大面包，中间裹着橘子果酱，看起来黏滑可口。接着她把水壶放在炉子上，这样一来，大家吃完橘子酱面包，茶也煮好了，就等着倒入杯中。大家端着自己的茶，每个人都往后挪了挪凳子，斜靠在墙上，满足地舒了一口气。

“现在，”海狸先生说着推开自己的啤酒杯，端了一杯茶放到面前，又说道，“等我一下，让我把烟斗点上——好了，开始说正事吧。又下雪了。”他斜眼看了一下窗户，加了一句：“这样最好了，这种天气就不会有人拜访我们，而且如果有人跟着咱们，他们也找不到我们的踪迹。”





第八章　晚餐之后发生的事情


“现在请您，”露西说，“告诉我们塔姆纳斯先生发生了什么事。”

“啊，太不幸了，”海狸先生说着摇了摇脑袋，“这件事非常非常可怕。毫无疑问的是他被警卫带走了，一只目睹了全过程的鸟儿告诉我的。”

“可是他被带到哪里去了呢？”露西问。

“哎，他们最后一次被见到是朝北方去了，我们都知道那意味着什么。”

“可我们不知道那是什么意思。”苏珊说。

海狸先生非常忧伤地摇了摇头。“恐怕他是被带到她的房子里去了。”他说。

“可是，海狸先生，他们会对他做什么呢？”露西上气不接下气地问。

“这个，”海狸先生说，“就说不准了。不过被带到那里去的，没几个能出来的。成了雕像！全都变成了雕像——他们这样说的。院子里，一直到石阶上，还有大厅里全都是。她把大家变成——”他停顿下来，耸了一下肩，“变成石头雕像。”

“可是，海狸先生，那我们能不能，”露西说，“我的意思是，我们必须去救他。这太可怕了，都是因为我。”

“亲爱的，如果你们能救他，我相信你们不会袖手旁观。”海狸先生说，“只不过你们不可能活着进去，再活着出来。”

“我们能不能合计一下？”彼得说，“我是说能不能打扮成什么东西，或者装成——呃，小商小贩或者随便什么，或者等她不在里面的时候，或者——噢，真是可恶至极。但一定是有办法的，那个半人羊冒着生命危险救了我妹妹，我们不能眼见他被——被——施以那样的酷刑。”

“亚当之子，没什么好处，”海狸先生说，“这样做，对你们所有人，都没任何好处。不过，现在阿斯兰已经出发了——”

“啊，对！快给我们说说阿斯兰的事！”几个孩子异口同声道。听到阿斯兰的名字，他们再次感受到那种奇妙的感觉：像是春天的讯号，又像好消息，正在到来。

“阿斯兰是谁？”苏珊问。

“你问阿斯兰是谁？”海狸先生说，“啊，你们难道不知道？他就是国王，是整座森林的国王，但是并不经常在这里，这你们能理解吧。在我父亲的年代和我的年代，他都没有在这里出现过。不过我们接到消息，他回来了。他现在已经在纳尼亚了，他会处置白女巫的。你们救不了塔姆纳斯，但是阿斯兰可以。”

“她不会把他也变成石头吗？”埃德蒙说。

“上帝保佑你，亚当之子，你说得太轻巧了！”海狸先生大笑道，“把他变成石头？如果她能站着直视阿斯兰，都算她能耐大了，就这点我都觉得她不一定能做到。不，不，阿斯兰会伸张正义，就如同古老的歌谣所言：

阿斯兰一来到，邪恶全压倒；

它发出一声吼，悲伤顿无踪；

阿斯兰一张口，严冬即消融；

它鬃毛一轻抖，春天便重返。

等你见到他的时候，你就会明白了。”

“可是我们会见到他吗？”苏珊问。

“啊哈，夏娃之女，我带你们来就是去见他的。我会带你们去见他。”海狸先生说。

“他——是个人吗？”露西问。

“阿斯兰是人？”海狸先生坚决地说，“当然不是。我告诉过你们他是森林之王，是伟大的越海大帝的儿子，你们难道还没明白他是野兽之王？阿斯兰是一头狮子——一头雄狮，伟大的狮王。”

“噢——”苏珊说，“我刚还以为他是人。那他会伤害人吗？去见狮子，我有点儿害怕。”

“这话不假，亲爱的小女孩，害怕是自然的，”海狸太太说，“如果谁见着阿斯兰双腿不打战，那他要么比寻常人勇敢，要么就是个呆瓜。”

“这么说，他很可怕，对吗？”露西说。

“可怕？”海狸先生说，“你没听见海狸太太刚对你说的吗？有说他不可怕吗？他当然令人生畏，但他本性善良。我告诉你，他是国王。”

“我很期待见到他，”彼得说，“即便说到底，其实我也很害怕。”

“对的，亚当之子，”海狸先生说着猛拍一下爪子，震得桌上杯子和茶托叮当响，“会见到他的。消息已经传出来，要你们去见阿斯兰。如果可以的话，明天你们就去石桌见他。”

“那是哪里呀？”露西问。

“我马上告诉你，”海狸先生说，“就在河流下游某处，离这里还远着呢。我会带你们去。”

“可是，可怜的塔姆纳斯先生怎么办？”

“最快速的解救他的办法就是去见阿斯兰，”海狸先生说，“等他和我们会合，我们就可以开始做事，这也不是说我们不需要你们。还有一首古老的歌谣是这样的：

当亚当骨与亚当肉

荣登凯尔帕拉维尔王座

邪恶时代将一去不复返

如今阿斯兰来了，你们也到了，看来一切都要结束了。我们以前听说阿斯兰来过这里——很久很久之前，谁也不知道是什么时候，但是从来没有人见过你们来。”

“海狸先生，你这么说，我有个不明白的地方，”彼得说，“我的意思是，难道白女巫不是人吗？”

“她倒是希望我们相信她是人，”海狸先生说，“这也是她自称为女王的理由，但她根本就不是夏娃之女。她有你们的祖先亚当（说到这，海狸先生鞠躬致敬）的第一任妻子莉莉丝[10]的血脉。她是神怪家族中的一员，一方面是这样的，另一方面，她还有巨人的血脉。不不，白女巫身上一滴真正的人血也没有。”

“海狸先生，这也是她如此作恶多端的原因。”海狸太太说。

“说得对，太太，”海狸先生回应道，“关于人类可能有两种观点（对在座各位，并无冒犯的意思），但是对那种看起来像是人类而并非人类的东西来说，可不存在两种观点。”

“我见过善良的小矮人。”海狸太太说。

“你既然说到这个，我也是见过的，”她的丈夫说，“但好的小矮人也少得可怜，还是当中那些长得最不像人的。总之，听我说一句，一般来说，如果你看见一个东西现在不是人，一会儿后变成了人；或是之前是人，现在不是；或者是本该是人，但以其他样子出现，你就得小心点儿，准备好你的短斧。这也是白女巫在纳尼亚大肆寻找人类的原因，她已经找了很多年啦，她要是知道这里有四个人，就该变得更加危险了。”

“这两者有什么联系呢？”彼得问。

“因为还有一个预言，”海狸先生说，“凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿，就是河流入海处的那座宫殿，如果一切正常，那里应该是整个国家的首都；在凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿，有四个王位，不知从什么年代开始，就有这么一个传说——当亚当的两个儿子和夏娃的两个女儿坐上王位，不仅白女巫的统治会到尽头，她的生命也将终结。这也是我们一路上万般谨慎的原因，如果她知道你们几个，要取你们的性命，估计就像我捋捋胡须这样轻松。”

四个孩子聚精会神地听海狸先生讲，大家好长一段时间都没有注意到其他的事情。海狸先生说完最后一个字，在那片刻的寂静无声中，露西突然问：

“我说，埃德蒙哪里去了？”

一阵可怕的沉默之后，大家开始问：“谁最后看见他的？他消失多久了？是不是在外面？”接着都跑出去找他。此刻，外面大雪纷飞，池塘绿色的冰面消失在厚厚的白毯之下，站在位于堤坝中央的小屋门前，几乎看不见河岸。大家跑出门，走到没过脚踝的松软新下的雪里，在房子四周朝各个方向呼喊“埃德蒙！埃德蒙！”直到大家的嗓子都沙哑了。可是大雪无声飘下，似乎吞没了他们的喊声，因为甚至没有回声作回应。

“这也太可怕了！”待大家最终绝望地回到屋里，苏珊哀叹，“唉，真希望我们没有来这里。”

“海狸先生，我们接下来到底该怎么办？”彼得问。

“怎么办？”海狸先生说，他已经穿上了自己的雪地靴，“怎么办？我们必须马上离开，一刻也不能停留！”

“我们最好分成四支搜寻小分队，”彼得说，“每支分队去不同的地方找，谁先找到的话，一定要立刻回到这里，然后——”

“我说亚当之子，搜寻小分队？”海狸先生说，“用来做什么？”

“啊，当然是去找埃德蒙啊！”

“寻找他没有任何意义。”海狸先生说。

“你这话什么意思？”苏珊说，“他不可能走很远，我们得去找他。你说不用去找他是什么意思？”

“不用去寻找他，”海狸先生说，“就是因为我们已经知道他离开了。”大家听后，都诧异地瞪着他。“难道你们还不明白吗？”海狸先生说，“他去找她了，去找那个白女巫了，他背叛了我们。”

“啊，不会吧——天啊，不会吧！”苏珊说，“他不会这么做的。”

“他不会？”海狸先生反问道。他严肃地看着三个孩子，大家想说的话都消失在嘴边，因为突然之间，每个人心里都涌起一种确信的感觉——埃德蒙的确背叛大家了。

“可他知道路吗？”彼得问。

“他之前来过这个国家吗？”海狸先生问，“他有没有单独来过这里？”

“有，”露西说，声音小得就像在说悄悄话一样，“恐怕他来过了。”

“那么他有没有告诉过你，他在这里做了什么，遇见了谁？”

“这个，没有，他没有告诉我。”露西说。

“那么，记住我的话，”海狸先生说，“他已经见过白女巫了，而且加入了她的阵营，并且知道她住在哪里。我之前并不愿意向你们提起（毕竟他是你们的兄弟），当我看见你们的兄弟的时候，我心里自语道‘不可信任’。他的表情和那些与白女巫为伍，并吃过她食物的人的表情一模一样。你们要是在纳尼亚待久了，光看他们的眼神，就能分辨出来。”

“就算这样，”彼得几乎哽咽着说，“我们还是要去找他，虽然他是个小坏蛋，他毕竟是我们的兄弟，而且还是个小孩子。”

“去白女巫的住处找他？”海狸先生说，“难道你们还没有明白，无论是救他还是保住你们的小命，唯一的机会就是不要靠近白女巫？”

“这是什么意思？”露西问。

“啊唷！她就是想抓住你们四个（她一直想着凯尔帕拉维尔的四个王位）。你们几个一旦踏入她的地盘，她就大功告成了，而你们呢，还没来得及开口，就已经变成那里的四尊新石头雕像。但是如果只有埃德蒙一个人在那里，他就不会有性命之忧，因为白女巫要把他当作诱饵，引你们三个上钩。”

“唉，有谁可以帮我们吗？”露西大声哭了起来。

“只有阿斯兰可以，”海狸先生说，“我们必须赶去见他。现在他是我们唯一的机会。”

“亲爱的小孩儿，我觉得有一点很重要，”海狸太太说，“就是埃德蒙什么时候溜走的，他会告诉白女巫多少取决于他听到了多少。比方说，他走之前我们是不是已经讲到了阿斯兰？如果那会儿我们还没有说到阿斯兰，那对我们很有利，因为她就不会知道阿斯兰已经到了纳尼亚，也不会知道我们要去见他，这样一来，她也不会提高警惕。”

“说阿斯兰那会儿，我不记得他还在不在——”彼得刚开口，但露西打断了他。

“呀，那会儿他在，”她十分苦恼地说，“你们还记得吗，就是他问为什么白女巫不能把阿斯兰变成石头的？”

“那他确实在，好家伙！”彼得说，“也就他能说出这样的话！”

“糟了，糟了。”海狸说，“还有一个问题，我告诉你们与阿斯兰见面的地方是石桌那会儿，他还在不在？”

但这个问题，谁也回答不上来。

“因为，如果他在的话，”海狸先生继续说，“白女巫就会驾着雪橇往那个方向去，在我们前往石桌的路上截住我们。那样的话，我们就见不到阿斯兰了。”

“不过，据我对她的了解，她要做的第一件事情应该不是这个，”海狸太太说，“一旦埃德蒙告诉她我们都在这里，她就会连夜赶过来抓我们，如果埃德蒙半小时前离开的话，那二十分钟后她就能到这里了。”

“太太，你说得对，”她的丈夫说，“我们必须离开这里，刻不容缓。”





第九章　在白女巫的宫殿


此时此刻，你们当然想知道埃德蒙那边发生了什么。他吃了自己那份晚餐，但他一点儿都不爱吃，因为他一直想着土耳其软糖——虽然嘴里吃着美味的食物，但没有什么能比记忆里的被施过魔法的食物更能败坏普通食物的美味了。他也听着大家的谈话，但又觉得乏味，因为他一直觉得没有人理会他，大家都在冷落他。事实上，大家并没有忽视他，这都是他想象出来的。他坐在那里，一直听到海狸先生讲到阿斯兰，讲到在石桌那里会见阿斯兰的安排，就在这时候，他悄悄起身溜到挂在门口的窗帘边上。提及阿斯兰的名字，大家都有神秘而美好的感觉，他却觉得神秘而可怕。

就在海狸先生重复《亚当的骨与肉》这首歌谣的时候，埃德蒙轻轻地转动门把手；海狸先生还没有讲到白女巫并不是人，而是半妖魔半巨人，埃德蒙已经走到外面雪地里，小心翼翼地关上了身后的门。

这时候，可千万别以为埃德蒙想让他的兄弟姐妹变成石头雕像，他还没恶毒到这个地步，他只是心心念念着土耳其软糖，还想成为王子（之后再成为国王），以回敬彼得之前说他是坏蛋一事。至于白女巫如何对待他们三人，埃德蒙并不想她对他们特别好，当然不能给他们和自己同样的地位，但他认为或者是假装认为，她不会对他们做什么特别坏的事情，“因为，”他心里想，“这些说她坏话的人都是她的敌人，那这些话也许不全是真话。再说，她对我那么好，无论如何，比这些人待我好多了。我倒是真的希望她是真正的女王。不管怎么说，她都比可怕的阿斯兰好多了！”至少这些都是埃德蒙为自己的行为找的借口。然而这并不是什么好借口，因为他内心深处知道白女巫是邪恶而狠毒的。

埃德蒙走出门后，发现外面漫天飞雪，首先想到的是自己把外套忘在了海狸家，这时候回去拿肯定没机会了；第二意识到的是几乎没有了天光。他们坐下来吃饭时就快三点了，何况冬季里白昼又很短。他没料到会是这样的情况，不过眼下也只好硬着头皮走了。于是他竖起衣领，在堤坝顶部一步步地挪（幸亏下过雪，路面不太滑），往远处的河岸边走去。

等他走到河岸边的时候，情况就不妙了。天色越来越黑，周围的飞雪疯狂乱舞，他几乎看不清前方三英尺开外的路，事实上已经没有路了。他总是滑进雪堆里，在结冰的水坑打滑，被地上的树干绊倒，从陡峭的岸边滑下去，被石头擦破小腿皮，最后落得浑身冰冷透湿、满是瘀青，可怕的还有那无声无息的寂静和孤独。我想要不是他自言自语了一句“等以后成为纳尼亚的国王，我第一件要做的事就是修几条好走的道路”，他也许会放弃整个计划，回去坦白自己的行为，然后和其他人继续做朋友。可就这么一句话，激发了他的幻想，他想着自己成为国王，还有成为国王后可以做的其他事情。这些遐想大大鼓舞了埃德蒙。他脑子里已经想好要住什么样的宫殿，要拥有多少辆车，有关私人电影院的种种细节，还有主要的铁路要通过哪些地方，要制定哪些法律来压制海狸以及它们的堤坝。刚好思考完如何制定方案以使彼得不插手他的事情，天气就变化了。先是雪停住了；接着一阵风吹起来，寒冷刺骨；最后云层散去，月亮出来了。正是满月的日子，月光照在白雪上，一切看起来就像白天一样，不过地上的影子会让人怀疑这是不是白天。

你还记得那条河吗？就是（当大家刚刚来到海狸家时）他看见的汇入下面那条大河的小河——当他走到那里的时候，要不是月亮出来了，他永远也找不到路。走到小河边上，他便转身顺着河往上走，不过比起他刚刚走的大山谷，这条小河所在的山谷更加陡峭，岩石更多，而且到处都是茂密的灌木，所以他根本没法在黑暗中行走。尽管有月亮照耀，他还是不得不在树枝下弯着腰穿行，一碰到树枝，大块的雪就掉在他背上，他浑身都湿透了。每次雪掉在自己身上的时候，他就越发恨彼得——似乎这一切都是彼得的错误。

最后，他终于来到一处较为平坦的地方，山谷也变得开阔起来。就在那里，在小河的另一边，离他不远处，他看见一座房子屹立在两座小山之间的平地上，那一定是白女巫的房子。此时的月亮比之前更加明亮。那座房子其实是一座很小的城堡，似乎全都是塔，塔顶都是尖尖长长的，就像是锋利的针尖一样。这些塔看起来就像学生受罚时戴的尖帽子或者巫师的帽子。在月光下，它们的长影子倒映在雪地上，看起来奇怪极了。埃德蒙已经对这房子感到害怕了。

只是这时候再回头已经太晚了。

他跨过结了冰的河面，直往那座房子走去。四周一片死寂，连最细微的声响都没有。他走在刚下过雪的地上，也没有一丝声响。他走啊走，绕过一个又一个房子拐角，经过一个又一个角楼，去寻找大门的所在，直到走了一圈，走到最远的地方才找到门。那是一扇高大的拱门，可这大铁门竟然是大大敞开着的。

埃德蒙蹑手蹑脚走到拱门前，往院子里望，这一眼所见差点儿让他心脏停止了跳动。原来就在门内，月光下照耀下，一头雄伟的狮子蹲在那里，就似要扑过来一样。埃德蒙就站在拱门的影子下，不敢向前，也不敢后退，两条腿不由得颤抖。他定在那里好长一段时间，原本牙齿并没有因为害怕而颤抖，现在也因为长时间的寒冷被冻得咯咯打战。我也不知道这到底过了多久，估计埃德蒙在那里站了好几个小时。

终于，过了那么久，埃德蒙开始思考为什么狮子还是那样——从他见到它开始到现在，它都没有移动过一英寸。于是埃德蒙向前走近了一点儿，不过仍然尽可能待在拱门的影子下，这时他看清狮子只是蹲伏在那里，但是并没有看自己（“万一它转头了怎么办？”埃德蒙心想）。事实上，狮子正看向别处——在它背后，离它四英尺远的一个小矮人。“啊哈！”埃德蒙心想，“等它扑向小矮人的时候，我就有机会逃跑了。”然而，那只狮子还是一动不动，那个小矮人也是一动不动。这时候，埃德蒙才想起之前大家说白女巫会把人变成石头的事来。也许这就是头石头狮子而已，想到这里，埃德蒙才注意到狮子的背上和头顶上覆盖了一层雪。这一定只是一尊雕像而已！才不会有活物让自己被雪盖住哩！埃德蒙慢慢地向狮子靠近，心儿扑通扑通跳，就像要爆炸一样。即使现在，他也不怎么敢摸它，但他最终还是伸出手飞快地摸了一下狮子。真是冷冰冰的石头！他害怕半天的东西原来是一尊雕像！

埃德蒙觉得一下就轻松了起来，尽管依然寒冷，但他却突然觉得从头到脚都暖和了起来，同时他脑子里突然冒出一个似乎十分绝妙的想法。“也许，”他心想，“这就是他们口中伟大的狮子阿斯兰。她已经抓住了他，并把他变成了石头，所以他们依靠它的美好愿望也都是一场空了！噗！谁怕阿斯兰啊？”

埃德蒙站在那里，幸灾乐祸地打量那头石狮子，过了一会儿，他做了一件十分愚蠢而幼稚的事情。他从口袋里掏出一个铅笔头，在狮子的上唇涂抹了两撮胡子，还在眼睛上画了一副眼镜，然后取笑道：“哟！愚蠢的老阿斯兰，你怎么变成一块石头了？你可能觉得自己还不错，是不是？”尽管被乱涂乱抹，这头巨大的野兽在月光下瞪着眼，看起来依旧吓人、忧郁、高贵，埃德蒙自讨了个没趣。他转过身，准备穿过院子往里面走。

他走到院子中间，看见几十尊石头雕像散落在各处，整个场面就像下到一半的国际象棋，雕像就是棋盘上排布的棋子，有石头萨梯[11]、石头狼、石头熊、石头狐狸、石头山猫，等等。有的石像形状很好看，看起来像是女人，但那其实是树精。有一座魁梧的半人马石头像，有一座长翅膀的飞马，还有一个身长而柔软的生物，埃德蒙认为那是一条龙。在冰冷而明亮的月光下，这些石头雕像定在那里，看起来栩栩如生，但又都一动不动，整个院子看起来怪异极了，要穿过这样的院子令人毛骨悚然。就在院子正中央，有一尊巨大的石像，样子像人，但和大树一样高，面目狰狞，胡子蓬松，右手拿一根木棒。即使埃德蒙知道那是石头巨人，并不是活着的，但他还是不愿意从他旁边走过。

这时，埃德蒙看见院子远端的门口有一道微弱的灯光，便往那边走去。通向那道门的阶梯由石头砌成，埃德蒙拾级而上。有一只大狼躺在入口处。

“没事，没事。”他不断安慰自己，“不过是一只石头狼而已，它伤害不到我的。”接着便抬腿想要跨过去。那只大狼突地站起来，背上的毛全竖了起来，它张开血盆大口，咆哮道：

“是谁？是谁？站住，陌生人，告诉我你是谁？”

“先生，恕我冒犯，”埃德蒙哆嗦得都快说不出话了，“我叫埃德蒙，我是亚当之子，之前在森林里见过女王，我来是告诉她我的兄弟姐妹都来纳尼亚了，他们就在这附近，在海狸家。女王她——她想见他们。”

“我马上禀告女王，”那只狼说，“同时，你要是不想死的话，就给我站在这里不要动。”说完就消失在屋子里了。

埃德蒙站在那里等，他的手指都冻疼了，心脏也咚咚地撞击胸口。过了一会儿，那只灰狼，其实就是白女巫的秘署统领——毛格林姆跳着跑回来，向埃德蒙喊道：“进来！进来！幸亏你是女王最想见的人，不然你可就没这么幸运了。”

埃德蒙往里面走，十二万分小心谨慎，生怕踩到灰狼的爪子。

他走在长长的、阴暗的大厅里，有许多柱子，也像院子里一样到处都是石像，最靠近门口是一尊小半人羊的石像，表情极为悲伤，埃德蒙禁不住想这可能就是露西的朋友。屋子里唯一的光来自一盏灯，白女巫就坐在灯旁。

“女王，我来了。”埃德蒙说着，急切地往前走。

“你怎敢一个人前来？”女巫语气十分恐怖，“我没告诉过你要带其他人来吗？”

“女王，请恕罪，”埃德蒙说，“我已经尽自己最大的努力了。我把他们带到了离这里很近的地方，他们现在都在河上堤坝的小房里，和海狸夫妇在一起。”

女巫的脸上露出一抹残忍的笑容。

“这就是你全部的消息吗？”她问道。

“不，女王。”埃德蒙回答，说完走上前把离开海狸家前听到的话都告诉了女巫。

“什么！阿斯兰？”女巫大叫，“阿斯兰！这是真的吗？如果我发现你在撒谎——”

“请您息怒，我只是重复了他们说的话。”埃德蒙结结巴巴地说。

可这时那个女王根本不在意埃德蒙在说什么，她拍了拍手，埃德蒙之前遇见过的那个小矮人就立刻出现了。

“备好咱们的雪橇，”女巫下令说，“用那副没有铃铛的挽具。”





第十章　魔法开始破解


现在，我们必须回到海狸夫妇和三个孩子那里。海狸先生一说完“刻不容缓”四个字，除了海狸太太，大家都开始穿大衣。只见海狸太太拾起一只只口袋，摆在桌上，说：“嘿，海狸先生，把火腿取下来，那里有包茶，那有糖，还有一些火柴。谁能帮我从角落那只坛子里取两三块大面包出来？”

“海狸太太，你这是做什么？”苏珊惊呼道。

“亲爱的，我在给大家打包食物呀，”海狸太太冷静地说，“你不会以为我们不带任何吃的就上路吧？”

“但是我们没有时间了，”苏珊边说边系上大衣领上的扣子，“她随时都可能到这里。”

“我也是这么说的。”海狸先生附和道。

“你们别胡说，”他妻子说，“海狸先生，你好好想一下，她到这里至少需要一刻钟。”

“但是如果我们想要在她之前抵达石桌，”彼得说，“我们不是要尽快抢先一步吗？”

“海狸太太，你可要记住一点，”苏珊说，“一旦发现我们不在这里，她就会以最快的速度追我们。”

“她会的，”海狸太太说，“但无论我们怎么做，也不能在她之前赶到石桌，因为我们是用走的，而她是驾雪橇。”

“难道——我们就没有希望了吗？”苏珊说。

“现在先不要大惊小怪，办法是有的，”海狸太太说，“先从抽屉里拿出六条干净的手帕。我们当然还有一线希望。虽然不能赶在她前面，但是我们可以隐秘行事，走她意料之外的路，这样兴许能够成功。”

“海狸太太，这点倒是说得对，”她的丈夫说，“不过是时候离开这里了。”

“你也要开始大惊小怪吗，海狸先生？”他的妻子说，“这样。这下更好了。一共五块面包，最小的一块给我们当中最小的一个：就是你，我亲爱的。”她看着露西加了这一句。

“啊，请你快点儿吧。”露西说。

“好了，我差不多准备好了。”海狸太太终于说她准备好了，并允许她丈夫帮她穿上雪地靴。“缝纫机太重了，就别带了，是这意思吧？”

“对啊，肯定是。”海狸先生说，“那太沉了。难道你觉得逃跑的路上还能用它，我觉得你不会这么想吧？”

“我无法不去想白女巫会怎么糟蹋它，”海狸太太说，“她多半会砸碎，或者偷回去。”

“哎唷，求求你，求求你，求求你，快点儿吧！”那三个孩子说。他们终于出门了，海狸先生把门一锁（“这会拖延她一点儿时间。”他说），大家便出发了，每个人肩上都扛着各自的包袱。

大家上路的时候，雪已经停了，月亮也出来了。他们排成一队前行——海狸先生走在最前面，之后依次是露西、彼得、苏珊，走在最后面的是海狸太太。海狸先生带领大家穿过堤坝，来到河流右岸，之后又带他们穿过河岸下方一条崎岖的林间道路。山谷在月光下显得亮堂堂的，两侧峭壁高高耸立。“最好是尽可能往低处走，”他说，“她不得不走上面，因为雪橇无法从下面走。”

要是坐在舒服的扶手椅上，透过窗户观望此时的景象，那确实美好，甚至连身处其中的露西最开始也很享受。但是，他们不停地走啊走，走啊走，慢慢地，露西感觉肩上的口袋越来越沉，她开始担心自己要怎样才能跟上队伍。她之前一直沿路欣赏亮闪闪的冰河，河上形成的冰瀑布，白茫茫一片的树顶，大大的、明亮的月亮和无数的星星，而现在她只能看着海狸先生嗒嗒嗒嗒向前行走的小短腿，好像永远不会停下来一样。后来，月亮消失了，雪又下起来。露西实在是太疲惫，走着走着快要睡着了，她走啊走，突然发现海狸先生从河岸拐到右边，带领他们爬上一道陡坡，进入茂密的灌木丛。等她完全清醒过来，才发现海狸先生只不过是钻进了河畔的一个小洞。那个洞隐藏在灌木丛中，只有走到正上方才能看见。事实上，当露西反应过来发生了什么时，能看见的只是海狸先生的短平尾巴了。

露西立刻弯下腰，随着海狸爬进洞，之后又听见身后传来爬行、呼吸和喘气的声音，不一会儿，一行五个都进了洞。

“这到底是什么地方？”是彼得的声音，在黑暗中听起来很是疲劳、无力（我希望你能明白声音无力是什么意思）。

“这是困难时期海狸的旧藏身之所，”海狸先生说，“是一个很秘密的地方。虽然这地儿不太好，但我们必须睡几个小时。”

“要是刚开始你们不那么大惊小怪，我肯定会带上几个枕头。”海狸太太说。

露西心想：这可不像塔姆纳斯的岩洞那样精巧，只是地上的一个洞，不过这里干燥，满是泥土气。这个洞十分小，所以大家躺下时，看起来就像是一捆捆衣服摆在一起。正因为这样，再加上长时间行走使得他们身子暖和，大家都觉得温暖舒适。当然，要是地面再平整一点儿就更好了。接着，海狸太太在黑暗中摸出一个小小的细颈瓶子，递给大家，大家一一接过来，饮了一口瓶中的液体。喝完后，一个个呛得直咳嗽，嗓子眼也火辣辣地疼，不过身子倒奇妙地暖和起来，所有人很快就睡着了。

似乎只过了片刻（但其实都过了好几个小时了），露西醒过来，她觉得有一点儿冷，身体也特别僵硬，心想要是能洗个热水澡该多好啊。她感觉自己的脸颊被长长的胡须挠得痒痒，然后就看见冷冽的日光从洞口照射进来。不过她立即完全醒了过来，大家也都全醒了。事实上，大家都坐了起来，眼睛睁得大大的，嘴巴也张得大大的，大家听着一个声音，就是他们昨晚一路上都想着的那个声音（有的还想象自己听到了）——叮叮当当的铃铛声。

一听到这个声音，海狸先生就像闪电一样跑出洞。也许你会想这样做太傻了，对吧？露西也是这样想的。但实际上这是一个明智的举动，因为他知道自己可以爬到河岸的顶部，藏在灌木丛和荆棘之中而不被人发现，他这样做就是要看看女巫的雪橇往哪个方向走。剩下的人都坐在洞里一边等着，一边猜想着。等了差不多五分钟，大家听到了令他们骇然的声音——他们听到了谈话声。“糟了！”露西心想，“他被发现了，她抓住他了！”令大家吃惊的是，过了一小会儿，他们听见海狸先生在洞口呼唤大家。

“没事儿！”他大喊道，“出来吧，海狸太太！亚当之子和女儿们，大家出来吧。不用担心，不是她！”他的语法都乱了，但海狸高兴的时候说话就是这个样子，我的意思是生活在纳尼亚的海狸——在我们的世界里，他们根本不会说话。

于是，海狸太太和孩子们匆忙爬出洞，白日光下眨巴着眼睛，满身尘土，也都没有梳洗，脏兮兮的，眼睛里还流露着睡意。

“快过来！”海狸先生大声喊，他高兴得快手舞足蹈起来了，“快过来看！这对女王可是当头一棒啊！好像她的魔力已经开始失效了。”

“海狸先生，你这是什么意思？”彼得喘着气问，大家刚爬上山谷陡峭的河岸。

“我之前是不是告诉过你，”海狸先生说，“她把这里弄得一直都是冬天，而且从来没有圣诞节？难道我没给你说过？嘿，现在快过来看看！”

接着大家都来到上面，看见了一切。

那是一辆雪橇，由几只驯鹿拉着，挽具上挂着铃铛。不过这些驯鹿比女巫的高大一些，而且它们通体棕色，而不是白色。那雪橇上坐着一个人，大家一眼就把他认出来了。他身材高大，穿着鲜红色衣服（就像冬青浆果那样鲜艳），头戴风帽，里面是皮毛的，白白的大胡子拖到胸前，就像是白色的泡沫瀑布一样。大家都知道他是谁。因为尽管这样体型的人只有在纳尼亚才能见到，但是即使在我们的世界——衣柜门外的世界里，你也见过他们的画像，听人谈论过他们。只是当你在纳尼亚真的见到他们，还是会觉得他们和你所熟悉的形象有很大区别。在我们的世界里，圣诞老人的一些画像看起来很有趣、很喜庆。不过，现在，孩子们站在这个圣诞老人面前，发现他和他们印象中的圣诞老人很不一样。这个圣诞老人特别高大，他看起来非常高兴，又是如此真实，大家看见他后都安静了下来。他们觉得很开心，但又觉得很严肃。

“我终于来到这里了！”他说，“她把我赶走很长一段时间了，但我最终还是进来了，阿斯兰已经在行动了。女巫的魔法正被削弱。”

露西感到内心深处生发出一种贯穿全身的喜悦的战栗感，这种感觉只有当你安静且严肃的时候才能感受到。

“那现在，”圣诞老人说，“送给你们礼物！海狸太太，这有一架崭新的、更好的缝纫机，这是给你的。我经过你家的时候，给你放那里吧。”

“有劳你了，先生，”海狸太太说着，行了一个屈膝礼，“可是房子锁起来了。”

“锁和门闩对我来说可不是问题，”圣诞老人说，“海狸先生，你回去就会发现你的堤坝已经竣工，修缮完毕，所有漏水的地方都修补好了，还安了一扇新闸门。”

海狸先生开心得嘴巴张得老大，话都说不出来了。

“亚当之子，彼得。”圣诞老人说。

“在，先生。”彼得说。

“这是给你的礼物，”圣诞老人回答说，“这是工具，不是玩具，可能很快就要用到它们了，好好带着吧。”说着他就递给彼得一面盾牌和一把剑。盾牌是银色的，上面画有一头红色的狮子，就跟你刚摘下来的成熟草莓一样鲜艳。那把剑的剑柄是金色的，剑鞘、佩剑腰带一应俱全，而且重量和尺寸刚好适合彼得。彼得接过礼物时默默无语，态度也很庄重，因为他觉得这是很严肃的礼物。

“夏娃之女，苏珊，”圣诞老人说，“这是给你的。”他拿出一把弓和装满箭矢的箭袋，还有一只小小的象牙号角。“不到万不得已，不能用这把弓，”他说，“因为我并不要你上战场战斗，而这把弓几乎百发百中。而这号角，只要你放在嘴边吹，无论你在哪里，我想都会有援兵襄助。”

最后，他说：“夏娃之女，露西。”露西便走上前。他给了她一个小瓶子和一把小匕首，瓶子看起来像是玻璃做的（但人们后来说瓶身是钻石做的）。“这个瓶子里装的是回魂露，”他说，“是由火焰花汁液炼制而成，那花生长在太阳山峰上。如果你或是你的朋友受伤了，滴上几滴这个，就能立刻痊愈。这把匕首是给你在关键时刻防身用的，你也不要上战场打仗。”

“为什么啊，先生？”露西说，“我觉得——我不知道——可是我觉得我可以很勇敢的。”

“这不是问题的关键，”他说，“但是有女人参与的战斗是邪恶的。好了，现在，”他突然变得不那么严肃了，“还有东西是给你们此时此刻用的！”他说着拿出一个很大的托盘，上面放着五套茶杯茶托、一碗糖块、一罐奶油和一个滋滋冒着热气的大茶壶，然后大声说：“圣诞快乐！真正的国王万岁！”说完，他一挥手中的鞭子，大家还没意识到他准备离开，驯鹿就拉着雪橇从他们眼前消失了。

彼得刚从剑鞘里抽出剑给海狸先生看，海狸太太就发话了：

“行了！行了！别站在那边，一会儿茶都凉了。像个男子汉一样，过来帮着把托盘放下，我们就可以吃早餐了。真是幸运，我竟想到了带切面包的刀。”

于是，大家顺着陡峭的山坡往下走，回到洞里面。海狸先生切了一些面包和火腿，放在三明治里，海狸太太倒上茶，大家便开始享用早餐了。可惜，还没等大家享用完，海狸先生又发话了：“是时候上路了！”





第十一章　阿斯兰靠近了


而与此同时，另一边的埃德蒙的境遇则令人沮丧。在小矮人去准备雪橇的当口，埃德蒙还期待女巫会对他友好，就像上一次相见时那样，但是女巫一个字也没有说。直到最后，埃德蒙鼓起勇气开口说话：“求求你，女王，能给我一些土耳其软糖吗？您——您——说过——”而女巫的回答却是：“闭嘴！蠢货！”过了一会儿，她似乎改变了主意，说道，像是自言自语：“要是这个小子等会儿饿晕在路上，那也不行。”于是她再次拍了拍手，另一个小矮人便出现在她面前。

“给这个人类拿点儿食物和饮料来。”她命令道。

小矮人随即离开，很快就端着一个铁碗和铁盘子回来了，碗里装着水，盘子里放着一大块干面包。他把这些放在埃德蒙脚边，并露出邪恶的笑容，说：“为小王子准备的土耳其软糖，哈哈哈！”

“拿走，”埃德蒙恼怒地说，“我要的不是干面包！”白女巫突然转向埃德蒙，表情非常可怕，埃德蒙吓得连忙道歉，啃起那块面包，可是那面包已经放了太久，实在难以下咽。

“现在还有的吃，你就庆幸吧，等到你再吃上面包，还不知道得到什么时候。”女巫说。

在埃德蒙嚼面包的时候，第一个小矮人回来报告雪橇已经备好了。白女巫站起来往外面走，并命令埃德蒙跟着她。当他们来到院子时，发现雪又开始下了，但是女巫对此毫不在意，径直走上雪橇，又让埃德蒙坐到她身边。临出发，她又传唤毛格林姆，毛格林姆像一只大狗似的跳到雪橇旁边。

“带上你最迅猛的狼，立刻赶去海狸家，”女巫说，“看见谁，就杀谁。如果他们已经离开，那就以最快的速度赶到石桌，但是不要被人发现，藏起来等我。在找到可以驾雪橇过河的地方之前，我得往西走好几英里。你们可能会在人类到达石桌之前赶上他们，要是抓住他们，你知道该怎么办。”

“遵命，女王。”那只狼咆哮道，然后冲进雪地，如疾驰的骏马消失在黑暗中。没过几分钟，他就带着另一只狼往堤坝奔去，随后出现在海狸的房子前，当然他们发现房子是空的。如果夜晚的天气依然很好，对海狸夫妇和孩子们来说那会非常可怕，因为那样狼会跟踪他们的足迹，十有八九能在他们到达岩洞之前追上。不过雪又开始下了，他们的气味被冲淡，连足迹也被雪花覆盖住了。

此刻，小矮人挥鞭赶驯鹿，带着白女巫和埃德蒙，穿过拱门，驶向黑暗的冰天雪地里。埃德蒙没有外套，这对他来说简直就是最糟糕的行程。出发还不到一刻钟，他身前就堆满了雪，刚开始他还试着掸去雪花，但很快就放弃了，因为不管他动作多快，面前还是会积满雪，而且他实在是太累了。不久，他就全身湿透了。唉，此刻他多么痛苦啊！现在看来，女巫可没有要立他为王的意思。之前他劝自己相信她是善良的好人，她这边才是正义的，现在他才觉得那些话好傻。现在他愿意放弃这一切，马上去见其他人——甚至是彼得。现在他唯一安慰自己的办法就是试着相信这一切都只是一场梦，自己随时都会醒过来。而他们走啊走，走了一个小时又一个小时，那似乎真是一场梦。

这样的处境持续了很长很长时间，即使我再写很多页也无法描述，于是我略掉这一段，跳到雪停后的第二天早上，他们在白日光下疾驶，不停地走啊走，四下里只有唰唰声和驯鹿挽具的嘎吱响声。终于，白女巫开口说话了：“停下，看看这里发生什么了？”他们这才停了下来。

埃德蒙多么希望她讲与早餐有关的东西，但是女巫停下来却是因为另外一个不一样的原因。原来在不远处的树下，一群快乐的动物坐着凳子围在桌前：松鼠和它的妻儿，两个萨梯，一个小矮人和一只老沙狐。埃德蒙看不清楚他们在吃什么，但是闻起来很美味，好像桌上有冬青装饰，他好像还看见像梅子布丁的东西，不过他也不确定。雪橇停下的瞬间，那只狐狸——显然是在座最年长的——刚好右手端着酒杯站起来，仿佛正准备说些什么。可这时，所有人都看见雪橇停下来，也看清楚谁坐在雪橇上，大家脸上的喜悦立刻消失了。松鼠爸爸正要把手中的叉子送进嘴里，而一个萨梯的叉子还在嘴里，小松鼠们被吓得吱哇乱叫。

“这是什么意思？”女巫陛下发问。没有一个人回答。

“刁民，快说！”女巫又说道，“挨了小矮人的鞭打才肯说吗？你们这样大吃大喝，糟蹋食物，放纵享乐，究竟是为何？这些东西又是哪来的？”

“回女王，”狐狸说，“这些东西是他人赠送的，请允许我斗胆举杯，祝愿陛下身体安康——”

“谁给你们的？”女巫问。

“圣——圣——圣——圣诞老人。”狐狸结结巴巴地说。

“什么？”女巫从座位上弹起来，大跨几步，来到这群惊恐的动物面前，咆哮道，“他不在这里！他不可能来这里！你们胆子竟然这么大——但是不可能。承认自己在撒谎，我现在就宽恕你们。”

这时，其中一只小松鼠被吓得完全失去了理智。

“他来过这里——他来过这里——他来过这里！”它一边尖叫，一边用小勺子敲打桌面。

埃德蒙看见女巫紧咬嘴唇，那雪白的脸颊上甚至出现出了一滴鲜血。接着，她举起魔杖。

“啊！不要！不要！求求你不要这样做！”埃德蒙大声哀求道，但是还没等他说完，女巫就已经挥动了魔杖。刹那间，原本欢乐的聚会就只是围坐在石桌旁的一尊尊石头雕像了（其中一尊雕像手中的叉子永远停留在了半空），盘子变成了石头盘子，梅子布丁也变成了石头梅子布丁。

“至于你，”女巫说着回到雪橇上，给了埃德蒙一巴掌，疼得他差点儿晕过去，“这就是为间谍和叛徒求情的代价，给你个教训！上路！”此时的埃德蒙为他们感到难过，这也是他在这个故事中第一次为别人感到伤心。想到年复一年，无论是寂静的白天，还是黑暗的夜晚，这些小石头雕像都被定在这里，直到身上长满青苔，甚至最后面目风化，真是觉得可怜啊！

现在他们又开始稳稳地行驶在路上。没过多久，埃德蒙发现雪橇溅起的雪泥比昨晚的更湿了，同时，他还注意到没有那么冷了，天也变得越来越雾蒙蒙的。事实上，天确实越来越暖和，雾也越来越浓，而雪橇也没先前行驶得顺畅了。最开始，他以为是驯鹿累了，不过很过就明白过来真正原因不是这个。雪橇突然猛地往前一滑，然后不停颠簸，就像行驶在石头上一样。这时无论小矮人如何鞭打可怜的驯鹿，前进速度依旧变得越来越慢。埃德蒙注意到周围出现了奇怪的声响，但是由于耳朵里充斥着雪橇行驶、颠簸的声音，还有小矮人训斥驯鹿的声音，他无法听清楚那是什么。直到后来，雪橇突然卡住，完全不动了，世界一下陷入片刻的安静。这时候埃德蒙终于能听清楚那个声音了。那是一个奇怪又美妙的声音，沙沙沙，簌簌簌……但又不是那么奇怪，因为他之前在其他地方听过这个声音，要是此刻能记起来在哪里听过就好了！后来，他突然记起来了，那是流水的声音。虽然看不见在哪里，但是周围肯定有很多水流，有的发出沙沙、淙淙的响声，有的汩汩冒泡，还有水花哗啦啦四溅，甚至（远处）还有激流轰鸣。埃德蒙意识到冰冻期结束了，心里猛地一跳（尽管他几乎不知为何会有此反应）。近处，树枝正在滴水，每一棵树都是这样。随后他望向一棵树，看见一大块雪从树上滑下去，接着便看到深绿色的冷杉树，这是他进入纳尼亚后第一次看见绿色。不过，他没有时间继续观看和聆听，因为这时女巫发话了：

“蠢货！别坐着傻瞪眼！下去帮忙。”

埃德蒙当然只好听命于她。他踏进雪地里——不过现在雪地已经变成雪泥了——着手帮小矮人把陷入泥坑的雪橇弄出去。最后，他们终于成功将雪橇弄了出来。小矮人以残忍的方式对待驯鹿，终于换取了雪橇的起步，他们继续向前行驶了一小段距离。这时，白雪正在迅速融化，一块一块的绿地出现在四面八方。除非你看雪的时间和埃德蒙一样长，否则你很难想象在经历没有尽头的白色之后，再见到这些绿地时，心里的那份舒畅！

“不好了，女王陛下，”小矮人说，“雪橇无法在泥地里行驶。”

“那我们就必须步行了。”女巫说。

“步行的话，我们无法赶上他们。”小矮人嘟囔道，“他们毕竟抢先一步。”

“你是我的顾问，还是我的奴隶？”女巫说，“听从吩咐！把这个人类双手绑在背后，你拉好绳子，然后带上鞭子，割断驯鹿的挽具，它们会找到回家的路。”

小矮人一一照办。几分钟之后，埃德蒙就发现自己双手被捆在背后，同时被赶着以最快的速度前进。他不断滑倒在雪泥里、泥坑中和湿草地上。他每摔倒一次，小矮人就会骂他一句，有时还会给他一鞭子。女巫走在小矮人后面，不断说：“快点儿！快点儿！”

随着时间一分一秒过去，绿草地的面积越来越大；白雪覆盖的面积越来越小；越来越多的树木脱掉原本雪白的袍子。没过多久，无论你望向哪个方向，看见的不再是一个个白色的轮廓，取而代之的是深绿色的冷杉树、光秃秃的橡树的黑色刺状树干，或是山毛榉和榆树。接着雾由白色变为金色，不久又都消散了。一道道明媚的阳光照射到森林地面上，抬头望便可看见树梢间的蓝色天空。

接着，越来越多的美妙事情发生了。他们刚转过一个弯，来到一块林间空地，周围长着白桦树，埃德蒙便发现草地上各个方向都长了小黄花——白屈菜花[12]。流水声越来越大，不久后他们果真看到了一条小溪。他们跨过溪流，发现溪边长满了雪滴花[13]。

“安心走你的路！”当小矮人看见埃德蒙扭头看花，恶狠狠地拉了一下绳子。

可是这自然无法阻碍埃德蒙继续看。五分钟后，他就又注意到一棵老树下长满了番红花，有金黄色的、紫色的，还有白色的。接着，一个声音响起来，比流水声还要让人欢快。原来在他们行走的路边，刚好一只鸟儿站在树枝上鸣叫。一声叫罢，不远处传来另一只鸟儿的回应。这就像是一个信号，紧接着，鸟叫声从四面八方传来，啾啾、喳喳，不一会儿，鸟叫声就汇成了一首歌。五分钟里，整座森林就回荡起鸟儿的歌声。无论埃德蒙朝哪个方向看，他都能看见鸟儿：有的刚好落在树上，有的从头顶飞过，有的彼此追逐或是争吵，有的正用自己的喙梳理羽毛。

“快点儿！快点儿！”白女巫吼道。

此刻，大雾已经完全消散，天空越来越蓝，不时会有团团白云急急地飘过。宽阔的林间空地上，闪耀着迎春花儿的绰姿。一阵微风起来，携着摇晃树枝散落下的水珠，带着凉爽、沁心的香气，拂在行路人的脸上。树木开始焕发勃勃生机。落叶松和桦树都披上绿色的外衣；金链花披上了金色的外套；山毛榉树也很快长出柔嫩、透明的叶子来。大家走在树下，光线也被渲染为绿色。一只蜜蜂嗡嗡嗡地从他们眼前飞过去。

“这不是融雪，”小矮人说，突然停下脚步，“这是春天！我们该怎么办啊？我给你讲，你的隆冬被打败了！这是阿斯兰做的。”

“你们谁要是再提到那个名字一次，”白女巫说，“谁就等着受死！”





第十二章　彼得的第一场战斗


正当小矮人和白女巫说话的时候，几英里之外，海狸夫妇和孩子们已经在如同美妙梦境的世界里行走了几个小时。好早之前，他们就舍弃大衣了；不久前大家还总是停下来互相叫嚷：“看，有一只翠鸟！”或者说“哇，蓝铃花！”或是“什么味道这么好闻？”或者是“快听画眉鸟在叫！”现在，大家只是静静地走路，陶醉在其中。他们穿过温暖阳光照射的草地；然后走进凉爽的绿色茂密树林；走出树林后，又进入一片长满苔藓的林间空地，空地上方高大的榆树枝杈交叠在一起，形成一个“树叶屋顶”；接着走入密密麻麻的醋栗树丛中，树上的花儿开得正茂；然后来到山楂树丛中，花儿的甜美气息令人不禁沉醉。

当大家看见冬天慢慢消逝，整座森林在短短几个小时之间从一月进入五月，他们和埃德蒙一样惊讶。他们甚至不确信这一切的发生，是由于阿斯兰来到纳尼亚的缘故（女巫倒是很确信这一点），但是他们都知道无止境的冬天是白女巫的诅咒造成的。因此，当大家看到魔法春天的显现，也就知道女巫的诡计进展不顺，而且还不是小的不顺。积雪融化一段时间后，大家都意识到女巫不能再使用她的雪橇了。他们后来就不那么急着赶路，休息时间也越来越多、越长。毋庸置疑，他们已经很疲乏了，但又不是那种精疲力尽的累，只是动作迟缓，身体飘忽，内心平静，就像一个人在户外待了一整天，终于快要结束的感觉。苏珊的脚后跟磨出了一个小泡。

他们老早就不再沿大河那条路走了，因为要去石桌，方向必须朝偏右（也就是偏南）一点儿行进。再说即使路线不是这样，融雪后，他们也不能沿河谷走，因为雪融化后，流水入河，很快就形成一股洪流——汹涌奔腾、咆哮如雷的黄色洪流，而他们的道路自然会被河水淹没。

此时此刻，太阳西垂，日色渐红，拉的影子更长，花儿也准备闭合了。

“现在不远了！”海狸先生说。他开始带大家爬一个山坡，坡面有一片苔藓地，茂盛的苔藓软绵绵的（疲惫的双脚踩在上面倒是很舒服），只有高大树木稀稀拉拉地伫立着。经过漫长的一天，最后还要爬一段上坡路，大家都累得气喘吁吁。露西心里正想要是不好好休息一次，自己是否能爬上山顶，这时他们突然就到达了山顶。以下就是他们见到的景色。

他们站在一块绿色的空地上，往下望，除了正前方，一望无际的森林向各个方向延伸，而正前方是东方，远处有东西在晃动，而且闪闪发光。“天啊！”彼得低声对苏珊说，“是大海！”山顶空地的正中央立着石桌，桌面是一块巨大的令人生畏的灰色石板，由四块直立的石头支撑，看起来很古老，上面刻满奇怪的线条和图案，也许那是某种未知语言的字母，让人一看便顿生一种奇怪的感觉。他们看见的第二个东西是搭在空地一边的帐篷。帐篷看起来十分富丽，尤其是现在落日余晖洒在上面，帐幔像是黄色的绸缎，深红色的绳索，象牙色的帐篷桩，顶上有一根高高的旗杆，旗杆上挂着一面印有红色雄狮的旗帜。一阵微风从远处海面吹来，拂过每一个人的脸庞，旗帜也随风飘扬起来。正当大家盯着旗子看时，右方传来一阵乐声，大家应声扭头，看见的正是他们一路前来所要见的。

阿斯兰站在各种生物中间，他们簇拥着围成一个半月形，有森林女神、井仙女（在我们的世界里，她们被称为树精和水精），正是她们在弹奏乐器；有四个强壮的半人马[14]，马身像英国农场的大马，人身像严厉而优美的巨人；还有一匹独角兽，一头长着人脑袋的公牛，一只鹈鹕，一只雄鹰和一个勇猛的猎狗。站在阿斯兰旁边的是两头猎豹，一个端着阿斯兰的王冠，一个拿着他的旗子。

看见阿斯兰的时候，海狸夫妇和孩子们都不知道该做什么或者说什么。没来过纳尼亚的人可能有时候认为善良和可怕是不能并存的。这几个孩子要是之前也这样认为，此刻就会改变看法了。因为当大家抬头看阿斯兰的脸，只瞥了一眼那金色的鬃毛和那对有神、高贵、深邃、慑人的眼睛，就都不敢再看了，一个个吓得直发抖。

“你去。”海狸先生低声说。

“不，”彼得小声说，“你先去！”

“不行，亚当之子在动物之前。”海狸先生悄声回应彼得。

“苏珊，”彼得悄声说，“要不你去吧？女士优先。”

“不，你年龄最大，”苏珊小声说。很明显，他们这样子拖得越久，越显得尴尬。最后彼得意识到这僵局得靠他打破，于是他举剑示意，匆匆对其他几个说：“好啦！大家振作起来！”然后走向狮子，说：

“我们到了——阿斯兰。”

“欢迎你，亚当之子，彼得，”阿斯兰说，“欢迎你们，夏娃之女，苏珊和露西，欢迎海狸先生和海狸太太。”

他的声音浑厚、深沉，不知不觉就消除了大家的紧张不安。现在他们只觉得高兴，心里也很平静，即使站着不说话也不会觉得尴尬了。

“可怎么没见到第四个人类之子？”阿斯兰问。

“哦，阿斯兰，他背叛了大家，加入白女巫那边了。”海狸先生说。彼得觉得有必要说明一下，便说：

“部分错在我，阿斯兰。我对他很生气，我觉得我的行为促使他走上了错误的道路。”

阿斯兰听完什么也没有说，没有说原谅的话，也没有说责备的话，他只是站在那里，大眼睛坚定地望着彼得。大家似乎也觉得没有必要说任何话。

“请问——阿斯兰，”露西说，“能做点儿什么去救埃德蒙吗？”

“该做的都会做，”阿斯兰说，“不过可能会比你想象的难得多。”说完他又陷入一阵沉默。之前露西一直觉得他的脸看起来那么高贵，那么坚强，那么平和，这时她却突然觉得他看起来又是那么忧伤。不过这个表情很快就消失了。狮子摇了下鬃毛，爪子一合——“要是他不知道如何做出轻柔的动作，”露西心里想，“那爪子真可怕。”——然后说：

“与此同时，准备好宴席。女士们，把夏娃之女带到帐篷去，好好照顾她们。”

女孩们走后，阿斯兰伸出爪子——虽然动作轻柔，但又很有力——搁在彼得肩上，说：“跟我来，亚当之子，我带你去远眺一下你即将称王的城堡。”

彼得手里依旧拿着剑，他跟着阿斯兰走到山顶东边。眼前铺陈着美丽的景色，身后的太阳慢慢西垂，山下的国土都笼罩在暮色中：森林、群山、山谷和如银蛇蜿蜒的大河下游。更远处，几英里之外是大海，而海天之外，飘满被夕阳映衬成玫瑰色的云朵。然而纳尼亚国土与大海相接的地方——其实就是大河入海处——那里有一座小山，山上亮光闪闪。那是一座城堡，朝向彼得和夕阳的窗户反射着夕阳余晖，闪耀无比，但在彼得看来那就像是在海岸边休憩的大星星。

“小男子汉，”阿斯兰说，“那里就是凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿，那里有四个王位，你必须以国王身份登上其中一个宝座。我带你来看，是因为你是你们四个中的老大，所以你的地位会高于其他三个，你是至尊王。”

再一次，彼得什么话也没说，因为那时突然有一个奇怪的声音划破了沉默，像是军号，但声音比号角更浑厚。

“是你妹妹的号角声，”阿斯兰用低沉的声音告诉彼得，声音低得像是猫咪发出的咕噜声——如果这样描写狮子的声音不算不尊敬的话。

过了好一会儿，彼得都没明白阿斯兰在说什么，然后他看见所有生物都往这边赶来，并听见阿斯兰挥着爪子说：“退后！让王子赢得他的第一场战斗！”他这才明白过来，并以自己最快的速度朝帐篷那边跑去。到那之后，他便看见这可怕的一幕——

森林女神和井仙女四处逃窜；露西脸色煞白如纸，两条小短腿不停奔跑，以最快的速度飞快地朝他跑来。接着他看见苏珊飞跑到一棵树下，急忙爬上去。她身后跟着一个灰色的大怪物。彼得最开始还以为那是一只熊，后来觉得像是阿尔萨斯牧羊犬，虽然体形比狗不知大出多少倍，到最后才意识到那是一只狼。那只狼后腿站立，前爪搭在树上，又咬又吼，背上的毛全都竖起来了。苏珊爬到第二层大树杈，就无法往上爬了，一条腿吊在那里，离嘶吼的狼嘴就只有一两英尺。彼得不知道苏珊为什么不继续爬高一些，或者至少抓牢一点儿，后来才明白过来她快要晕过去了，要是她真晕过去，就会掉下来。

彼得并没有觉得自己特别勇敢，事实上他反而觉得自己有一点儿恶心，但这并不影响他即将要做的事情。他直奔向那个怪物，一剑砍过去，但剑还没劈到，那狼就闪电般迅速转身，双目如燃起的火焰，大口张开，对着彼得一声怒吼。要不是那狼怒火中烧，必须嚎叫一番来发泄，彼得的喉咙早就被它咬住了。虽然一切发生得太快，彼得根本没时间思考，但多亏了狼的吼叫，他至少能在这期间闪开它的袭击，并趁机举剑，用最大的力气从那猛兽的前腿之间插下去，直接捅到心脏。紧接下来，就像是噩梦里的一些恐怖时刻，让人摸不着头脑。彼得连捅几下，狼也不知是死是活，只是一口利牙磕在彼得前额，到处都是血、热气和皮毛。过了片刻，他发现那怪物躺在地上死掉了，才从它身上拔出剑来，然后一边直起腰，一边擦去满头满脸的汗水。此刻，他感觉浑身精疲力尽。

后来过了一会儿，苏珊从树上爬下来。两人相见时，步子都摇摇晃晃，我可不会说两人没有亲吻和哭泣，但是在纳尼亚，谁也不会因为这个往坏处想。

“快！快！”阿斯兰大声吼，“半人马！雄鹰！树林里还有一匹狼，看——就在你们身后！他正要逃跑。跟上去，你们都去。他要跑回他女主人那里去。抓住时机，找到女巫，解救第四个亚当之子。”话音既落，立刻响起一阵雷鸣般的马蹄声和振翅声，约莫十来个最迅捷的动物已经消失在渐渐浓重的夜色里。

而彼得依旧气喘吁吁，他转过身，看见阿斯兰站在他身旁。

“你忘记擦干净自己的剑了。”阿斯兰说。

他说的是事实。彼得看到自己明亮的剑刃上沾着狼的血迹和毛，一下脸红了。他弯下腰，先在草地上擦干净，然后又用自己的衣服擦干。

“亚当之子，把剑给我，跪下。”阿斯兰说。彼得照做之后，阿斯兰用剑身拍了他一下，说：“起来吧！斩狼爵士——彼得！还有，以后无论发生什么，都不要忘记擦干净你的剑。”





第十三章　时光起点的高深魔法


现在我们得回到埃德蒙那边了，他被赶着一直往前走，他甚至觉得不会有人比他此次走得还远了。最后，那女巫终于在一条黑黢黢的山谷停下来。山谷上方完全被冷杉和紫杉树木遮住。埃德蒙瘫软下来，就那么趴着，什么也不做，甚至不关心接下来会发生什么，只要他们允许他这么安静趴着。他太累了，累得不知道自己有多饿、多渴。女巫和小矮人站在他旁边，小声交谈着。

“不，”小矮人说，“女王啊，现在已经没用了，他们现在肯定都到达石桌了。”

“说不定狼能嗅出我们的踪迹，给咱们带回消息。”女巫说。

“即使它回来，也不会有好消息。”小矮人说。

“凯尔帕拉维尔的四个王位，”女巫说，“要是只坐了三个呢？那预言也不会实现。”

“可现在还有什么区别，他都来这里了？”小矮人说。即使到现在，他也不敢向女主人提起阿斯兰的名字。

“他也许不会待太久，等他一走，那时候——我们就可以去凯尔宫殿抓那三个人。”

“但更好的办法也许是——”小矮人说，“留下这一个（说着踢了一下埃德蒙），到时候好和他们交涉。”

“对！他们会救他。”女巫轻蔑地说。

“接下来，”小矮人说，“我们最好立刻做我们该做的事情。”

“我要去石桌解决这件事，”女巫说，“那是再合适不过的地方，以前这类事都是在那里了结的。”

“现在等石桌再次发挥它应有的作用，恐怕还得要很长一段时间呢！”小矮人说。

“的确，”女巫说，过了一会儿，她又说，“那么，就让我来启动它。”

就在这时，一只咆哮的狼急冲到他们面前。

“我看见他们了！他们都在石桌那里，和他在一起。他们已经杀害了我的首领毛格林姆。我躲在树林里看见的，一个亚当之子把它杀死的。快逃！快逃！”

“不，”女巫说，“不用逃！赶紧的，召集我们所有人手，让大家尽快赶到这里与我会合。叫上巨人、狼人，还有站在我们这边的树精；动员食尸鬼、大眼怪、食人魔和牛头怪；发动冷面怪、巫婆、幽灵，以及毒蘑人。我们要战斗！怎么？我手里还有魔杖呢！等他们上来，还不都得一个个变成石头？赶快去办事，你走之后，我还有点儿事情要做。”

那狼点点头，便转身疾驰而去。

“现在！”她说，“我们没有桌子，让我想想，我们最好把那家伙绑在树干上。”

埃德蒙只觉自己被粗暴地拉起来。小矮人要求他背靠在树干上，接着就把他绑了起来。他看见女巫脱下外面的披风，露出两只赤裸的胳膊，白得瘆人。那手臂太白太白，所以埃德蒙能看见，但又看不见其他东西，因为在黑压压的树枝遮盖下，山谷黑暗无比。

“准备好祭品。”女巫说。于是小矮人解开埃德蒙的领子，又把领子往里折，接着抓住他的头发，往后拉，埃德蒙不得不昂起头。这之后，埃德蒙听到怪响——嗖——嗖——嗖。他一时想不出那是什么声音，后来才意识到那是磨刀的声音！

就在这时，他听见大喊大叫声从四面八方传来：敲鼓般的蹄声，拍动翅膀的声音——女巫一声尖叫——他一时摸不着头脑。随后他发现自己被松了绑，被几条强壮的胳膊环抱着，耳边响起的是和善而响亮的说话声——

“让他躺下来——给他一点儿酒——把这个喝了——放轻松——一会儿就没事了。”

接着，他听到人们的说话声，不是对他说，而是彼此交谈，诸如：“谁抓住了女巫？”“我以为是你。”“我把她手中的刀打落之后就没见她——我追小矮人去了——你的意思是她逃跑了？”“——一个人一时也顾不了所有事——那是什么？啊，不好意思，只是截老树桩而已！”就在这时，埃德蒙晕了过去。

不久之后，半人马、独角兽、鹿和鸟（它们正是上一章节阿斯兰派出的援救队伍）扛上埃德蒙，动身赶回石桌。不过如果他们看见他们离开后山谷里发生的事情，我想他们可能会被吓一跳。

四下寂静无声，没多久，月亮就变得亮堂堂的了。你当时若在场，就会看见一轮明月照在一截老树桩和一块不小的大圆石上，不过你要是继续观察，慢慢就会觉察到那树桩和巨石都有些不寻常。接下来估计你便会想到，那树桩着实像一个胖胖的小矮人蜷伏在地上的样子。再继续看久一点儿的话，你会看到那树桩竟走向巨石，后者坐直身子，两者开始说话。事实的真相是，那树桩是小矮人，巨石是女巫。这是她的魔法之一，能把一个东西变成另一个东西。当她手中的刀被打落的瞬间，她就想到要使用这个魔法，因为魔杖一直握在她手里，所以还是好好的。

第二天早晨，其他孩子醒过来（他们睡在帐篷内的一堆垫子上）听到的第一个消息——海狸先生告诉他们的——就是他们的兄弟被成功营救，昨天深夜被带回营地，现正和阿斯兰在一起。大家一吃过早餐，就跑到外面去看。他们看见阿斯兰和埃德蒙一同走在满是露水的草地上，没有任何随从跟随。你没必要知道阿斯兰在讲什么（也没有人听见），但这却是埃德蒙永远不会忘记的对话。大家走近时，阿斯兰同埃德蒙一起转身见他们。

“来见见你们的兄弟，”他说，“还有——就是没必要再跟他提起过去。”

埃德蒙和大家一一握手，并且依次对他们说“对不起”，每个人的回答都是“没关系”。每个人都竭力想说点儿什么，而且得是自然并且寻常的话题，表明他们和他还是朋友，但是一时谁也想不出该说什么。不过，还没等到陷入特别尴尬的气氛，一只猎豹就走到阿斯兰面前，通报说：

“陛下，敌方使者到，请求面见。”

“带他过来。”阿斯兰说。

那只豹离开不久，就领着女巫的小矮人上来了。

“大地之子，你带来什么消息？”阿斯兰问。

“纳尼亚女王、孤岛女皇要求前来与你会谈，但你要保证她的安全，”小矮人说，“谈话内容对双方均有利。”

“纳尼亚女王，真是！”海狸先生说，“一群喽啰的女王——”

“海狸，安静点儿，”阿斯兰说，“不久后，一切都将正名。在这之前，我们不要为此争论。大地之子，告诉你的女主人，只要她把魔杖留在那棵大橡树下，我就保证她的安全。”

双方达成一致。两只猎豹随小矮人过去，监督他们是否遵守协议。“但是万一她把两只豹子变成石头了呢？”露西悄悄对彼得说。我想那两只猎豹也这么想过。无论如何，它俩往前走的时候，背上的毛全竖起来了，尾巴也立了起来，那样子就像是一只猫看见一只陌生的狗时的反应。

“不会有事的。”彼得低声回答，“要是会出事，他也不会派它们去。”

几分钟后，白女巫单独走上山顶，径直走向阿斯兰，最后站在他面前。那三个孩子之前没见过她，一看见她的样子就被吓得后背发毛，在场的动物也都发出低沉的吼叫声。尽管当时阳光明媚，但大家还是感觉到突然的寒意。在场似乎只有两位表现很自然，一个是阿斯兰，另一个是女巫。这两张脸，一个金黄，一个死白，两张脸离这么近，真是一大奇事。白女巫并不怎么直视阿斯兰的眼睛，海狸太太尤其注意到了这一点。

“阿斯兰，你这里有一个叛徒。”女巫说。当然，在场所有人都明白她指的是埃德蒙，但是经历了这一切，尤其是早上和阿斯兰谈话之后，埃德蒙倒是把自己忽略了。他只是和之前一样看着阿斯兰，似乎女巫说的话没有任何意义。

“哦，”阿斯兰说，“可他又不是背叛你。”

“你是不是把高深魔咒忘记了？”女巫问。

“就当是我忘记了，”阿斯兰阴沉着说，“那你给我们说说什么是高深魔咒。”

“给你们说？”女巫说，她的声音突然变得尖锐，“给你们讲那石桌，就是我们边上的石桌，上面写着什么？给你们讲镌刻的文字——刻痕凹陷就如神山上长矛深刺入火石——是什么？给你讲大海之外皇帝的权杖上镌刻着什么？你至少知道天地初开，帝君给纳尼亚设下的魔咒吧！你知道每一个叛徒都属于我，是我的合法猎物，我有权处死任何一个叛徒。”

“呵！”海狸先生说，“所以你就是这样幻想自己是女王的——借着你是帝君的刽子手的缘故。我明白了。”

“安静，海狸。”阿斯兰用十分低沉的声音说。

“所以说，”女巫继续说，“那个人属于我，他的生命是我的所有物，他的血液是我的财产。”

“那就过来取啊！”那头长着人脑袋的公牛大声吼道。

“蠢货！”女巫露出残忍的笑容，几乎是咆哮着说，“难道你真以为你的主人能通过武力抢走属于我的财产吗？高深魔咒，他清楚得很！他知道除非我依法得到血液，否则整个纳尼亚都将毁灭，在大火、洪灾中永远消失。”

“一点儿没错！”阿斯兰说，“我不否认这一点。”

“噢！阿斯兰！”苏珊在阿斯兰耳边私语，“难道我们不能——我是说，你不会真的交出他，对吗？关于这高深魔咒，难道我们不能做点儿什么吗？难道你不能做点儿什么对抗它吗？”

“对抗帝君的魔咒？”阿斯兰转过去对她说，似乎皱了皱眉头。还从来没有人给他提过这样的建议。

埃德蒙站在阿斯兰另一边，一直看着他的脸，他感觉自己快透不过气来了，他想着自己是否该说点儿什么，但片刻之后，他觉得自己不必说任何话，只需要等待，并且照之前的吩咐行事。

“大家退后，所有人，”阿斯兰说，“我要单独和女巫谈话。”

大家都照做了。这真是难熬的时光，狮子和女巫在一旁小声地密切交谈，大家只能等待和猜想。露西喊了一声“啊！埃德蒙！”就开始哭了起来；彼得背对大家站着，眼睛望着远处的海；海狸夫妇爪子握在一起，都低着头；那些半人马不安地用蹄子踏地。但是到后来，大家都安静下来，你甚至能听到很细微的声音，比如蜜蜂飞过的嗡嗡声、山下森林里的鸟叫声和风儿吹过树叶的声音。阿斯兰和女巫的交谈依旧继续。

最后，他们终于听到了阿斯兰的声音。“你们都可以回来了，”他说，“我已经解决了这个问题，她宣布放弃索取你们兄弟的血液。”整个山头骚动起来，似乎每个人之前都屏住了呼吸，现在又都开始呼吸了，接着传出一阵低声交谈的声音。

这时，女巫转过身来，脸上露出狂喜的表情，她说：

“可是，我怎么知道你会遵守诺言呢？”

“吼——吼——吼！”阿斯兰咆哮着，从宝座上半立起身来，那巨大的嘴张得越来越大，咆哮声也越来越大。女巫张着大嘴，看了半天之后，就提着裙子逃命了。





第十四章　女巫的胜利


女巫一走，阿斯兰就说：“我们必须立刻从这个地方撤离，这里会被派上其他用场。我们今晚要在贝鲁纳浅滩处扎营。”

不用说，大家都特别想问他和女巫之间的谈论结果如何，可是阿斯兰一脸严肃，每个人耳朵里都还回响着他的咆哮声，谁也不敢开口问。

大家吃完饭，在山顶露天下吃的（因为此刻阳光已经很强烈，把草地都晒蔫了），就开始忙着拆卸帐篷，打包东西。还没到两点，大家就已经出发往东北方向行进。因为目的地并不远，所以大家步伐平缓。

旅途刚开始，阿斯兰就向彼得解释他的作战计划。“一旦女巫办完这边的事情，”他说，“几乎可以确定她会带着手下回到她的宫殿，并在那里准备围攻我们。你可以截住她，不让她回去，不过你也可能失败。”他继续构思两场作战计划，一场是在森林中对战女巫及其手下；另一场是攻打她的城堡。他一直在指导彼得如何作战，说着“你必须把半人马安排在某某地方”或是“你必须派侦察兵去，不让女巫做某某事”，最后彼得说：

“但是，阿斯兰，到时你也会在那里吧。”

“这个我不做任何保证。”狮子说完，继续给彼得讲解作战步骤。

到旅途后半段，见阿斯兰最多的就是苏珊和露西了。阿斯兰不怎么说话，她们觉得他看起来有点儿悲伤。

还是下午的时候，大家来到一个地方，那里河谷豁然开阔，河面宽广，但河水较浅，这就是贝鲁纳浅滩。阿斯兰下令在岸边停下，但彼得说：

“在对岸扎营不是更好——恐怕她晚上会来偷袭之类？”

阿斯兰仿佛在思考其他事情，回过神来抖了抖华丽的鬃毛，说：“啊？你说什么？”彼得又重复了一次。

“不，”阿斯兰说，语气低沉，似乎这无关紧要，“不，她今晚不会袭击我们。”说完深深地叹了口气，但是旋即又补充道：“想得如此周到是好事，作为一名士兵，就应该这么想，不过在哪边扎营没有差别。”于是大家就在那里扎营。

那一晚，阿斯兰的心情影响了每一个人。一想到自己将单独作战，彼得就觉得很不踏实，对他来说，阿斯兰可能不在场的消息是一个不小的打击。晚饭大家吃得很安静，所有人都觉察到一切与昨晚不同，甚至和当天早上都不一样，就好像好日子刚刚开始就已经迫近尾声了。

苏珊被这种感觉深深地影响了，她上床睡觉，但根本没有任何睡意。她躺在那里数绵羊，不停地翻来覆去。她听见躺在旁边的露西长长地叹了一口气，在黑暗中翻了个身。

“你也睡不着吗？”苏珊说。

“对啊，”露西说，“我以为你都睡着啦！嘿，苏珊。”

“怎么了？”

“我有一种可怕的感觉——好像有什么大事要发生。”

“你有这样的感觉吗？因为，说真的，我也有这种感觉。”

“与阿斯兰有关，”露西说，“要么是有可怕的事情要发生在他头上；要么就是他要做可怕的事情。”

“整个下午，他都不大对劲，”苏珊说，“露西！他说不和我们一起作战是什么意思啊？你觉得呢？他会不会今晚就要离开我们，偷偷溜走了呢？”

“现在他在哪里？”露西问，“他在帐篷里吗？”

“我觉得不在。”

“苏珊！我们出去看看吧，也许能看见他。”

“好的，走吧，”苏珊说，“反正躺在这里也睡不着，还不如出去看看呢。”

两个女孩蹑手蹑脚，静悄悄地从熟睡的人群中摸索出去，来到帐篷外。月光亮堂堂的，除了河水冲刷石头的声音，四下寂静无声。突然，苏珊抓住露西的胳膊，说：“看！”她们看见在营地另一边，就在树木开始出现的地方，狮子正慢慢远离营地，往树林中走去。两人二话不说，跟了上去。

他带着她俩爬上陡峭的斜坡，走出河谷，然后微微偏向右走——显然这是大家下午从石桌山下来所走的那条路，路线一模一样。他带着她俩走啊走，走进黑暗的阴影里，走到灰白的月光下，走到双脚被浓浓的露水沾湿。他看起来跟她们所认识的阿斯兰不太一样。他的尾巴低垂，头也低了下去，走得很慢，仿佛十分疲惫。接着，狮子来到一块空阔的空地停下来，然后环视四周。那里没有阴影供她俩藏身，往后逃走也显得没有必要，于是两人向狮子走了过去。等她俩走得更近一点儿，他才开口说：

“唉！孩子们啊！孩子们啊！你们为什么要跟着我呢？”

“我们睡不着。”露西说了这一句就没继续往下说了——她深信自己不必再多说，阿斯兰知道她们在想什么。

“请问，我们能跟着你吗——无论你去哪里？”苏珊问。

“这个——”阿斯兰顿了一下，好像是在思考，然后说，“今晚能有人陪伴，我应该感到高兴。嗯，你们可以跟着我，但是必须答应我，我叫你们停下就要停下来，然后让我自己一个人走。”

“哦！谢谢，谢谢！我们答应你。”两个女孩说。

他们又上路了，狮子走在中间，两个女孩站在两边。可是，他走得多么缓慢啊！那高贵而威武的脑袋垂得那么低，以至于鼻子都快碰到草地了。后来他走着走着，打了个趔趄，发出一声低沉的呻吟。

“阿斯兰！亲爱的阿斯兰！”露西说，“你怎么了？难道你不能告诉我们吗？”

“亲爱的阿斯兰，你是不是生病了？”苏珊问。

“不是，”阿斯兰说，“我只是很悲伤，很孤独。把你们的手放在我的鬃毛上吧，这样我就能感觉到你们的存在，我们就这样继续走吧。”

自她们第一眼见到阿斯兰，就想摸摸他的鬃毛，只是没有他的允许，她们永远也不敢，今天终于如愿以偿。两个女孩把冰冷的手埋进那一片美丽如海的鬃毛里，轻轻抚摸着，就这样继续和阿斯兰往前走。过了一会儿，她们发现自己正随着阿斯兰往放置石桌的山坡走。他们往上爬，来到树林边缘，等走到最后一棵树旁（那棵树周围是灌木丛），阿斯兰停住脚步，他说：

“好了，孩子们，孩子们。到这里，你们必须停下来了。无论发生什么，都不要让人发现你们。永别了！”

两个孩子哭得很伤心（虽然她们几乎不知道是什么原因），她们抱着狮子，亲他的鬃毛、鼻子、爪子和那威武、悲伤的眼睛。然后他转身离开，往山顶走去。露西和苏珊蜷伏在灌木丛里，眼睛一直盯着他。这就是她们看见的一切——

一大波人聚集在石桌周围。虽然月光明亮，仍有许多人举着火把，邪恶的红火苗熊熊燃烧，冒着黑色的烟。那都是怎样的人啊！长着丑陋牙齿的食人魔、饿狼、牛头怪、邪恶的树精、毒植物精，以及其他一些生物，我就不一一描述了，不然大人们可能就不会让你看这本书了，它们有：冷面怪、巫婆、梦淫妖、幽灵、阴魂、火魔、妖精、地妖、小鬼和双头怪。事实上，凡是站在白女巫那边的，以及狼奉命召集来的人都站在这里，他们中央挨着石桌站立的正是女巫。

那群生物看见威猛的狮子向它们迈步走来，刚开始一片恐慌，发出一阵嗡嗡的嚎叫，就连女巫也一时心生恐惧。但随后她就恢复镇定，哈哈狂笑起来。

“是那个笨蛋！”她大声说，“那个笨蛋来了。赶紧把他捆起来。”

露西和苏珊屏住呼吸，等待阿斯兰咆哮，等待阿斯兰扑向那群敌人，然而这一切都没有发生。四个巫婆龇牙咧嘴、斜眼瞪着阿斯兰，一步步靠近，但（一开始）又犹豫不前，十分害怕。“喂！把他绑起来！”女巫重复说。巫婆们发现狮子完全不反抗，便猛冲到他面前，发出胜利的尖叫。其他人——邪恶的小矮人和猿猴——也冲过去帮忙。它们把狮子推倒在地，把他四只爪子绑在一起。它们欢呼着、喊叫着，似乎完成了一件多么勇敢的事。然而，殊不知，只要狮子愿意，一只爪子就可以要了这群乌合之众的性命。可他一声不吭，甚至当敌人又扯又拉，把绳索勒进他肉里时，他也一言不发。接着他们开始把他往石桌拖去。

“停！”女巫说，“先把他的鬃毛剪掉！”

一只食人魔拿着大剪刀走上来，蹲在阿斯兰脑袋边上，女巫的手下爆发出一阵讥笑。随着大剪刀咔嚓咔嚓咔嚓，阿斯兰那浓密、金黄、鬈曲的鬃毛一一落在地上。剪毕，食人魔后退站立。两个孩子藏在灌木丛里，她们从远处能看见阿斯兰的脸，没了鬃毛，那张脸显得那么小，与先前完全不同。敌人也发现了这一变化。

“嗨！不过是只大猫而已！”其中一个说。

“我们害怕的竟然是这家伙？”另一个说。

接着它们都冲上去，围住阿斯兰，一边发出鄙夷的笑声，一边说着“小猫！小猫！可怜的猫咪！”或是“猫儿，你今天抓了多少只老鼠啊？”或是“猫咪呀，要不要来点儿牛奶？”

“天啊！它们怎么能这样？”露西说着眼泪顺着脸颊流了下来。“畜生！一群畜生！”这个时候，最初的震惊已经过去，阿斯兰虽被剪掉鬃毛，但在露西看来，他的脸显得更加勇敢，更加美丽，比以往更有耐心。

“套住他的嘴！”女巫发话。一行喽啰上前，给他套嘴套，即使这个时候，只要阿斯兰张张嘴，就能咬掉两三个喽啰的手，但他全然不动。他的安静似乎是一种挑衅，那群乌合之众被激怒了，每一个都上前欺辱他，那些之前害怕他，甚至当他被绑住也不敢上前的家伙现在都找到了勇气。那群密密麻麻的怪物将阿斯兰团团围住，不断踢他，打他，奚落他，向他吐唾沫。

最后，这群怪物闹够了，开始将被绑住且被套上嘴套的狮子拖向石桌，有的推，有的拉。阿斯兰体形巨大。它们好不容易将他拖到石桌跟前，又使出全身力气才把他搬到石桌上。之后，它们又给阿斯兰加上绳索，并且勒得更加紧实。

“胆小鬼！胆小鬼！”苏珊啜泣着说，“即使是现在，它们不也还是害怕他？”

等到阿斯兰被那群怪物绑在平坦的石头上（他被绑得如此严实，完全成了一堆绳索），现场陷入一片静默。这时，四个巫婆各举着一个火把，站在石桌的四角。女巫露出胳膊，就像前一晚对付埃德蒙时一样，只是这次是对阿斯兰下手，开始磨刀。火把的光映在刀刃上，在远处的孩子们眼里，那把刀不像是铁做的，倒像是石头做的，形状奇怪，透着邪恶之气。

最后，她走近石桌，站在阿斯兰的脑袋旁边，激动得面部扭曲，而阿斯兰脸朝上，望着天空，面容依旧安静，既无怒气，也不害怕，只是略带一点儿忧伤。女巫举刀正要捅下去，但她停了下来，她蹲下来，用颤抖的声音说：

“现在，是谁赢了？笨蛋！你以为你这样就能救那个人类的叛徒吗？现在根据协定，由你替他受罪，我将取你的性命，这样高深魔咒才不会应验。只要你一死，还能有谁阻止我杀他呢？那时还能有谁把他从我手掌心救出去？你要明白，你已经将纳尼亚拱手相让，直至永远。你失去了自己的性命，也没有救到他。也就是说，等待你的只有悔恨和死亡。”

女巫下手的瞬间两个孩子没有看。她们捂上眼睛，不敢看。





第十五章　时光起点前的更高深魔咒


当两个女孩还用双手捂着脸蹲在灌木丛中的时候，她们听见女巫大声喊着——

“现在！大家都跟上我，咱们去把这场战斗打完！既然这个大笨蛋、大蠢猫已经横尸于此，那用不了多久就能把人类害虫和叛徒解决掉。”

这时候，她俩好几秒都处于极其危险的境地，因为伴随着狂野的呼叫声、尖厉的风笛声，以及刺耳的号角声，那一群可恶的怪物从山顶冲下来，刚好从她俩藏身的灌木丛旁边的斜坡经过。她们感觉到幽灵像阵冷风一样从她们身边掠过；她们感受到牛头怪从她们身边奔驰而过时地面的震动；无数翅膀在她们头顶扇动，一大片黑压压的秃鹰和巨大的蝙蝠飞过。要是在其他时候，两个女孩早就被吓得浑身颤抖，但是此刻她们的脑袋里还充斥着阿斯兰离世带来的悲伤、耻辱与震惊，两人几乎顾不上害怕。

等到树林里再次安静下来，苏珊和露西便从灌木丛里爬出，来到空旷的山顶上。月亮越来越低，不时被飘过的片片薄云遮住，但是她俩还是能看清死去的狮子躺在绳索堆里的轮廓。她俩都跪在湿润的草地上，亲吻他冰冷的脸庞，抚摸他美丽的毛——那些没被剪掉的毛——她俩哭啊哭，哭到再也哭不出来。然后两人拉着手，互看着对方，只因觉得孤独，又哭出声来，然后又是一阵沉默。最后，露西说：

“我无法忍受看到那个吓人的嘴套，不知道咱们能不能把它取下来？”

于是她俩开始动手，经过好一番努力（此刻正是夜里最黑的时候，她们手指又都是冰凉的），终于成功了。然而，两人看见取下嘴套后的阿斯兰的脸，又放声哭出来，她俩亲吻他，爱抚他，尽可能地为他擦去脸上的血渍和白沫。那时的孤单、无助和恐惧，是我无法用文字描述的。

“我在想咱们能不能把绳子也解开？”过了一会儿，苏珊说。可是那些敌人由于怀恨在心，把绳索系得特别紧，两个女孩完全没法解开。

我希望这本书的读者当中，没有人像苏珊和露西那样痛苦过，但如果真有人经历了——一夜未眠，眼泪都哭尽了——这种情况，那么你就能明白最后会归于平静。你会觉得再也不会发生什么事。无论如何，这就是她俩当时的感受。在这一片死寂中，时间一个小时接一个小时地过去了，她们甚至没有注意到自己的身体变得越来越凉。不过最后，露西注意到两件事情：一是山东面的天空比一小时前亮堂了一些；另一个是她脚下的草地上有细微的动静。她一开始完全不在意。有什么关系呢？现在什么都无所谓了！但是她后来发现，这些东西开始沿着支撑石案的石头往上爬；而现在那些不知名的东西正在阿斯兰身上爬来爬去。她凑近一点儿观察，发现是一些灰色的小东西。

“啊！”石案另一边的苏珊大叫，“真可恶！可恶的小老鼠在他身上爬。滚开，你们这些小怪物。”她举起手，想要吓跑它们。

“等一下！”露西说，她凑到更近处静静观察它们，“你能看出它们在做什么吗？”

两个孩子弯下腰，瞪着眼睛观察。

“我真的相信——”苏珊说，“可这太奇怪了啊！它们在咬绳索！”

“我也是这么想的，”露西说，“我觉得它们是善良的老鼠。可怜的小家伙们——它们没有意识到他已经死了，肯定以为帮他解开绳子会有一些好处。”

此时的天色更加明亮，女孩们第一次注意到彼此煞白的面孔。她们看见许多小田鼠在一点点儿地咬绳索，几十只，甚至几百只。最后，那些绳索一根根全被咬断了。

现在东边的天空已经露出白肚皮，除了低垂在东边水平线上的一颗大星星，其他星星越来越暗淡，她们感到此刻比晚上的任何时候都要寒冷。小田鼠们也爬走了。

女孩们将断开的绳索清除干净。没有了绳子的束缚，阿斯兰看起来更像他原来的模样。时间一秒秒过去，他了无生气的脑袋愈发显得高贵；随着光线越来越明亮，她俩看得越来越清楚。

身后的树林传来一只鸟儿清脆的啼叫，她俩吓了一跳，因为之前数小时都是寂静无声的。紧接着传来另一只鸟儿的回应，不一会儿，整个树林都回荡着鸟儿的欢叫声。

很明显，这已经不是深夜，清晨已经来临。

“好冷啊。”露西说。

“我也是，”苏珊说，“我们四处走动下吧。”

她们走到小山东面的悬崖边，往下望，那颗大星星已经差不多没了踪影，整片大地都笼罩在深灰色的天空下，但更远处国土尽头的那片大海却是一片苍白。天空开始变红，她俩就在阿斯兰的尸体和东面悬崖之间来回走，以此来使身体暖和，来来回回，次数多到她们数不过来。哦！她们的腿多么累啊！最后，她们站定片刻，望向远处的大海和凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿（此刻她俩才辨认出宫殿的所在），海天相接的地方，红色变为金色，太阳的轮廓慢慢出现在她们眼前。就在这时，她们听到身后传来一声巨响，震耳欲聋，就像是一个巨人崩裂他巨大的盔甲。

“那是什么？”露西说着抓住了苏珊的胳膊。

“我——我不敢回头，”苏珊说，“肯定发生了可怕的事情。”

“他们在用更恶毒的方式对付他，”露西说，“快回去！”她说完便拉着苏珊一起转身。

在初升的太阳照耀下，一切都显得不一样了，因为色彩和明暗的转变，她俩刚开始并没看出什么来，后来才看见整张石桌裂成两半，而阿斯兰的尸体也不见了。

“唉呀！唉呀！唉呀！”两个孩子哭喊着，飞快地奔回石桌前。

“唉呀！太可怕了，”露西啜泣着，“他们怎么尸体都不留下！”

“谁干的？”苏珊大声说，“这是什么意思？是魔法吗？”

“是的！”她们身后传来响亮的回答。“这是更玄妙的魔法！”她们转过身。是阿斯兰，他站在初升的阳光下，晃动着鬃毛（明显又长了出来），比她们之前所见到的他更加魁梧。

“啊！阿斯兰！”两个孩子异口同声叫出来，她们盯着他，既开心，又害怕。

“亲爱的阿斯兰，难道说你刚才没死吗？”露西问道。

“此刻没死。”阿斯兰说。

“你不会是——不会是——？”苏珊问道，声音都是颤抖的，她没敢说出那个鬼字。阿斯兰低下金色的头，舔了一下苏珊的额头，她立刻感到一股热气和浓郁的味道——似乎是来自他的毛发——向她袭来。

“我像是那个东西吗？”他说。

“啊！你是活的，是活的！天啊！阿斯兰！”露西大声说。两个小姑娘扑到他身上，不断亲吻他。

“可这都是怎么回事呢？”等大家心情稍微平静后，苏珊开口问。

“这就是说，”阿斯兰说，“尽管女巫知道高深魔咒，但她不知道还有一个更高深的魔咒。她只知道时光起点时的事情。她要是再往前追溯，追溯到时光起点之前，也许就会知道那无尽的黑暗与宁静之中，还有一道特别的咒语——如果一个没有任何背叛行为的人，心甘情愿为背叛者受死，到那时，石桌坍塌，死转为生。所以现在——”

“啊，对，现在吗？”露西一边说，一边跳起来鼓掌。

“噢！孩子们，”狮子说，“我觉得自己已经恢复了力气。哈！孩子们，你们试试来抓我吧！”他在那里站了一会儿，眼睛明亮，四肢抖动，甩起尾巴，接着一跃越过两人头顶，落在石桌另一边。露西不知道为何自己笑个不停，她从石桌碎片上爬过去，试图抓住他。阿斯兰又是一跳，然后便是又一轮的疯狂追逐。他带着她俩绕着山头一圈圈跑，一会儿把她俩远远甩在后面，怎么都够不着；一会儿让她俩靠近直到快要摸到他的尾巴；一会儿又从她俩之间穿过去；一会儿又用柔软、美丽、硕大的爪子把她俩抛向空中，然后再接住；一会儿又冷不防停下来，大家嘻嘻哈哈抱团滚在一起，只见胳膊啊、腿啊，还有狮子的毛不时晃动。除了在纳尼亚还从未有人见过这样的嬉闹场面。露西一直说不准自己是在和一只猫咪玩耍，还是在和一头雄狮玩耍。最有趣的画面是最后大家都躺在太阳底下大口喘息，此时两个女孩早已把饥饿、口渴和疲惫忘得一干二净。

“现在，”片刻之后，阿斯兰说，“说正经事了。我马上要开口吼了，你俩最好用手堵住耳朵。”

两人便用手捂住耳朵。阿斯兰站起来，张开大口准备吼叫，他的脸变得极其可怕，两人都不敢看。随着一声巨吼，她俩只看见他面前的树全都弯了腰，就像是草地上的草儿被一阵大风吹弯了。接着阿斯兰说：

“我们还有一段长路要走，你俩必须骑在我身上。”说完，他蹲下身子，孩子们爬上他那金色温暖的后背。苏珊坐在前面，她紧紧抓住阿斯兰的鬃毛；露西在后面紧紧抓住苏珊。她俩坐定后，阿斯兰猛地腾身而起，往外冲去，他跑得比任何马儿都快，冲下山头往森林深处跑去。

此次骑行恐怕是她俩在纳尼亚经历过的最精彩的事情。不知道你有没有骑马奔驰过？想象一下骑马的情形，但没有沉重的马蹄踏地声和挽具撞击的叮当声，取而代之的是狮子大爪，踏地几乎没有任何声响；也不是坐在黑色、灰色或者栗色的马背上，而是坐在金色、柔软、蓬松的狮毛上，还有鬃毛被风拂倒；接着再想象一下，他的前进速度几乎是最快的赛马速度的两倍；而且他不需要别人指路，也从不会疲劳。他一直往前跑，从没有失足，从没有犹豫，以完美的技术穿行于树林间，越过灌木丛和荆棘丛，跨过小溪流，蹚过稍宽一点儿的小河，游过最宽的大河。而你不是在大路上，不是在公园里，也不是在下坡路上奔驰，而是穿越整个纳尼亚：在春日里，走下遍布山毛榉的条条阴暗道路；穿过洒满阳光的橡树林；经过开着雪白花儿的一片片野生樱树果园；经过水声隆隆的瀑布、长满青苔的岩石、回声不绝的岩洞；爬上刮风的山坡，那里闪耀着金雀花丛；穿过石楠丛生的山肩，再顺着山脊往下走，继续往下，再往下，来到野山谷之中；走出山谷，撞进一片开满蓝色花朵的田野。

已接近正午时分，她们看见陡峭的山下有一座城堡——从她俩所在的位置看，那像是一座玩具城堡——看起来似乎全是尖尖的塔楼。但是，狮子驮着她俩飞快地往山下奔跑，城堡越变越大，她俩还没来得及问这是什么就已经和城堡处于同一水平面了。这时，城堡可不像是玩具城堡了，它高耸入云，阴森森地伫立在她们面前。城垛上不见人影，大门也紧闭着。而阿斯兰丝毫没有减速，向一颗子弹一样直奔过去。

“这是女巫的房子！”他大声说，“现在，孩子们，抓紧了啊。”

一瞬间，似乎整个世界都颠倒了，孩子们觉得五脏六腑都被甩在后面，因为狮子鼓起劲来一跃而起，比之前任何一次都跳得高，他径直跳进——你甚至可以说是“飞进”，而不是“跳进”——城墙内。两个女孩虽然上气不接下气，但毫发未损，她俩从阿斯兰背上跌跌撞撞滚下来，发现自己落在一个堆满了雕像的宽阔的石院子中间。





第十六章　石像的变化


“真是个特别的地方！”露西大声说，“看这些动物石头雕像——还有人呢！这——这就像是一个博物馆。”

“嘘——”苏珊说，“阿斯兰在做事。”

他确实在做事。他跃向一头石头狮子，向它吐了一口气，然后片刻也不停留，飞奔到——像是一只追自己尾巴的猫咪一样——一个石头小矮人边上，也向它吐了一口气。正如你记住的那样，这个小矮人就在狮子背后几英尺的地方。接着，他扑向站在小矮人旁边的一个巨大的石头树精，又随即迅速转身向右边的石头兔子吐气，紧接着跑向两只半人马。就在这时，露西说：

“天啊！苏珊！看！看那头狮子。”

我猜你一定见过这样的场景：在壁炉中的干柴上面放一点报纸，先用火柴点燃报纸，刚开始没什么动静，过一会儿才看见报纸边缘蹿出一点儿火苗。此时的场景和这很相似——阿斯兰对石头狮子吐完气后，那狮子如先前那样定在那里。接着，过了一会儿，它雪白如大理石的背上开始出现一点点儿金黄色，接着那金黄色好似蔓延全身，就像火苗吞噬整张报纸那样。这时，虽然它后腿明显还是石头，但它一摇自己的鬃毛，之前沉重的石头就慢慢瓦解开来，冒出生气勃勃的狮毛。它张开血盆大口，打了一个巨大的哈欠。这时它的腿已经复苏，它举起一只爪子挠了一下自己。等它看见阿斯兰，便蹦跳着跑过去，绕着阿斯兰打转，不时欢快地低语，不时跳上去舔他的脸。

孩子们的眼珠子自然是跟着那狮子转，但是她们所见的场景如此奇妙，两人很快就忘记了狮子。所有的石像都慢慢地活了过来，这个院子不再像一个博物馆，此刻看起来更像是一个动物园。大家跟在阿斯兰身后跑来跑去，围着他跳舞，直到阿斯兰被完全淹没了。原本一片死白的院子变得五彩缤纷起来：有半人马油亮的栗色身躯，有独角兽靛蓝色的独角，有鸟儿炫目的各色羽毛，有红褐色的狐狸、狗、萨梯，有小矮人的黄色袜子和深红头巾，有银色的桦树女精灵，有色泽明亮或透绿的山毛榉女精灵，还有绿色——颜色明亮得接近黄色——的落叶松女精灵。原本一片死寂的地方，现在充斥着各种欢乐的咆哮声、驴叫声、嗥叫声、犬吠声、吱吱声、咕咕声、马儿嘶鸣声、蹄子踏地声、呐喊声、喝彩声、歌唱声，以及笑声。

“啊！”苏珊用不同的语气说，“看！我想——我是说这样安全吗？”

露西看过去，发现阿斯兰在对着一个石头巨人的脚呼气。

“没问题的！”阿斯兰大声欢呼道，“只要它的脚活过来，全身也会跟着活过来。”

“我不是这个意思。”苏珊小声对露西说。不过，现在做什么都来不及了，即使阿斯兰听懂她的话也来不及了，因为巨人的腿已经起变化了，现在它正在移动自己的脚。过了一会儿，它放下肩上的木棒，揉了揉眼睛，开口说道：

“天啊！我一定睡着啦！嗨！那个该死的、四处乱窜的小女巫在哪里？她刚才还在我脚边转悠。”但是，当大家伙儿扯着嗓子对巨人解释，他把手放在耳边仔细听，还让大家重复了一遍，最后才弄明白这一切是怎么回事，然后他低头深鞠一躬，脑袋低到不比干草堆高，不断向阿斯兰抚帽致意，丑陋的脸上洋溢着笑容。（如今在英国，各种巨人都很罕见，其中脾气温和的极少，会笑的巨人更是罕见。这情景倒是值得一看。）

“现在往里走！”阿斯兰说，“大家赶紧行动起来！楼上楼下，还有女巫的房间！每个角落都要检查！因为不知道一些可怜的囚犯会被藏在什么地方！”

大家冲进城堡内，几分钟后，这座黑暗、可怕、散发着陈腐气味的老城堡就回荡起噼里啪啦的开窗声和大家同时喊叫的声音：“不要忘记地牢——帮我们开一下门——这里还有一道弯曲的小楼梯——啊！快看，可怜的长颈鹿，叫阿斯兰过来——唷！这里味道太难闻了——小心机关门——快上来！这里比院子里的石像多多了！”不过，其中最好的信息属这个——露西冲上楼梯后，大声喊道：

“阿斯兰！阿斯兰！我找到塔姆纳斯先生了！啊，快来这里！”

过一会儿，露西和那只小半人羊就手拉手，开心地跳起舞来，转了一圈又一圈。这家伙虽然被变成了石像，但毕竟毫发未损，自然对露西要告诉他的一切都充满了兴趣。

最后，终于结束对女巫老巢的洗劫。整座城堡变得空荡荡的，每扇门窗都大开着，阳光和甜美的春天气息涌进这个原本充满黑暗和邪恶的地方，这里多么需要阳光和空气啊！这群重新获得生命的石像大军再次折回院内，就在这个时候，其中一个（我觉得是塔姆纳斯）首先开口：

“可我们怎么才能出去呢？”因为大门此时仍旧紧锁，而阿斯兰是跳进来的。

“不用担心这个！”阿斯兰说完，靠着后腿站起身来，对着巨人大吼。“嗨！那个大高个！”他大声喊，“怎么称呼？”

“回陛下，巨人吕波巴芬。”那个巨人说着又用手摸了摸帽子，以示致敬。

“好！巨人吕波巴芬，”阿斯兰说，“你能带我们出去吗？”

“没问题！陛下，愿意效劳。”吕波巴芬巨人说，“你们这些小不点儿，都离门站远点儿。”说完，巨人大步跨到门前，挥起手中的大棒梆梆梆敲起来。敲第一下时，门嘎吱作响；第二下，响起碎裂的声音；到第三下，门就成碎片了。随后，他开始对付两边的塔楼，捣鼓了几分钟，两个塔楼便轰隆隆倒下，两边的墙也坍塌了大半，地上躺着一堆堆碎石瓦片。尘土散去之后，大家站在这干燥、阴森的石头院子，透过刚才巨人敲开的缺口，望向外面的绿草地、随风摇摆的树木、森林里闪闪发亮的溪流、森林后面碧绿的群山和远处的辽阔天空。

“我现在肯定是满头大汗吧！”巨人说，像是铁路上最大的火车引擎一样喘着气，“处在这样的恶劣条件，我估计没有一位年轻女士带了手绢这类东西吧。”

“不，我有。”露西说着踮起脚尖，举起手帕，举到自己能举的最高处。

“谢谢你，小姐！”巨人吕波巴芬说着弯下身。瞬间，露西发现自己被巨人用食指和大拇指捏到了半空中，不由得害怕极了。就在快要靠近他的脸时，巨人才突然一惊，他一边将露西轻轻地放回地上，一边嘟哝道：“天啊！我怎么把一个小女孩拎起来了。对不起，小姐，我以为你是那块手绢。”

“没事，没事，”露西笑着说，“手绢在这里。”这次，巨人终于没有抓错，只是在它眼里手绢就像你们眼里的糖精片一般大小。看着巨人用那小小的手绢前前后后地认真擦着自己硕大的红脸，露西说：“吕波巴芬先生，恐怕这块手绢对你没多大作用吧。”

“不会，不会，”巨人礼貌地说，“我从来没见过这样精致的手绢。这么小巧，这么方便，这么……我都不知道该怎么形容它了。”

“这个巨人心真好！”露西对塔姆纳斯先生说。

“哦，是啊！”半人羊说，“巴芬巨人都很善良，在纳尼亚，它们是最受尊敬的巨人家族之一，可能不算很聪明（我从来没见过聪明的巨人），但是一个古老的家族。你知道的，都是有家族传统的。要是他是其他家族的，女巫也不会把他变成石头了。”

这时，阿斯兰拍了拍爪子，示意大家安静下来。

“我们今天的工作还没有结束，”他说，“要想在睡觉前击败女巫，必须立刻找到战场。”

“陛下！我希望加入！”半人马中最魁梧的那个说。

“当然，”阿斯兰说，“现在听我讲！那些跟不上的，也就是孩子、小矮人、小动物们，必须骑在跑得快的动物身上，也就是狮子、半人马、独角兽、马、巨人和雄鹰。嗅觉灵敏的和我们狮子走在前面，好辨别出战场的位置。大家赶紧各就各位。”

在一片喧闹和欢呼声中，大家开始找自己的队伍。其中最有趣的场面就是另一头狮子四处奔跑，装出忙碌的样子，实则只是为了告诉它见到的每一个动物：“你听见他说的了吗？我们狮子！是指他和我。我们狮子。这就是我尊敬阿斯兰的地方。不端架子，不居高临下。我们狮子，指的就是他和我。”它一直不停地说，直到阿斯兰将三个小矮人、一个树精、两只兔子、一个刺猬放到它背上，它才消停了一点儿。

等到一切就绪（主要还是靠一只牧羊犬，它帮阿斯兰将大伙安排到合适的位置），大家便从城堡裂开的缺口出发。开始的时候，狮子和狗各个方向嗅来嗅去，后来一只大猎犬突然大叫一声，它嗅到了战场的气息。这之后，大家就不再浪费时间。不一会儿，所有的狗、狮子、狼和其他狩猎动物都把鼻子贴近地面全速前进，其他的动物被甩出半英里远，但也都全力奔跑。听声音，这像极了英式猎狐的场景，好在除了猎犬吠声，不时还混有狮子的吼声，有时候还是阿斯兰发出的咆哮，他的声音更加低沉、吓人。它们越跑越快，气味也越来越容易嗅到。后来，大家走到狭窄、弯曲的山谷中最后一个拐弯时，露西听到在噪音之上，还有另外一个声音——一个不同的声音，她心里不由得觉得奇怪起来，那声音既夹有呼喊声、尖叫声，还混杂着金属撞击的声音。

等大家冲出那条狭窄的山谷，露西立刻明白过来这是怎么回事。原来彼得和埃德蒙，还有阿斯兰的剩余部队，正在和她前晚所见的那群怪异的生物激烈作战。只不过现在，在白日光下，它们看起来更加奇怪、更加邪恶、更加畸形，好像除它们之外，还有更多的怪物。而彼得的军队——他们背对着露西，看起来少得可怜。战场上各处散落着石像，显然女巫一直在使用魔杖。不过，她现在并未使用。她正挥舞着石刀，对手正是擎剑的彼得，两人打得火热，露西看不清谁占上风，只见刀光剑影飞闪，看起来就像是有三把刀、三把剑在飞舞。他俩位于战场中央，战线向两边延伸出去，露西目之所及尽是可怕的场面。

“孩子们，从我背上下来。”阿斯兰大喊，两人跌跌撞撞翻滚下去。接着，随着一声怒吼——这声音响彻了整个纳尼亚，从西面的灯柱一直到东边的海岸——这头巨大的野兽扑向了白女巫。露西看见白女巫抬头望向阿斯兰，脸上满是恐惧与惊异。后来狮子与女巫翻滚在一起，但女巫被压在下面。与此同时，阿斯兰从女巫老巢带来的动物全都疯狂地冲向敌人阵营：小矮人用战斧，狗用牙齿，巨人用大木棒（他的脚也踩倒了几十个敌人），独角兽用它们的角，半人马用剑和蹄子。彼得那支疲软的军队立即振奋起来，新参战者怒吼着，敌军乱嚷乱叫，整座树林淹没在一片喧嚣之中。





第十七章　追逐白鹿


大军一到，战役几分钟后就结束了。第一轮进攻，阿斯兰带领他的部队成功歼灭了大部分敌人；剩下的活着的敌人后来一见女巫死了，便缴械投降，或者赶紧逃跑了。露西接着看见彼得和阿斯兰在握手，她觉得此时的彼得看起来和之前很不一样：他的脸很苍白，神情严肃，好像成熟了许多。

“阿斯兰，这都是埃德蒙的功劳，”彼得说，“要不是他，我们早就被打败了。之前女巫用魔杖把我们很多战士都变成了石头，四处都是，谁也无法阻挡她。埃德蒙一路杀过去，冲过三个食人魔的阻挡，来到女巫面前，那时她正要施法，将你麾下一只豹子变成石头，埃德蒙当机立断，用剑劈她的魔杖，而不是直接向女巫进攻，否则他也只会落得被变成石头的下场，其他人之前都犯了这个错误。她的魔杖一被劈断，我们就有了机会——要是没有损失这么多兵力就好了。他受了重伤，我们必须马上去看他。”

在战线后方不远处，他们找到了由海狸太太照料的埃德蒙。他浑身是血，张着嘴，脸色发青，甚是吓人。

“露西，快！”阿斯兰说。

这时，露西几乎是头一回想起自己收到的那个圣诞礼物，那瓶珍贵的回魂露。她双手剧烈颤抖，怎么也打不开瓶塞，不过最终还是打开了，她给她哥哥嘴里倒了几滴。

“那边还有其他伤员。”就在露西急切地看着埃德蒙的脸，想知道回魂露会不会起作用时，阿斯兰说道。

“好，我知道了，”露西烦恼地说，“等一下。”

“夏娃之女，”阿斯兰的语气变得更加严肃，“其他人都是命悬一线，难道要让更多人因为埃德蒙而失去性命吗？”

“对不起，阿斯兰。”露西说着站起来跟上他的脚步。接下来的半个小时，他们一直忙碌着：露西忙着照顾伤员，阿斯兰忙着帮助那些石像变回原来的样子。最后，露西终于得空回去看埃德蒙，她发现他已经站起来了，不仅伤口复原了，而且看起来比之前好很多——噢！太久了！事实上，自从开始上那个讨厌的学校，他第一学期就开始变坏了。他又变回了最初的样子，能够正视他人眼睛了。阿斯兰就在这个战场上封他为骑士。

“他知道，”露西小声地对苏珊说，“阿斯兰为他所做的事情吗？他知道和女巫协议的具体内容吗？”

“嘘！不，当然不知道！”苏珊说。

“不是应该告诉他这件事吗？”露西说。

“哦！当然不能，”苏珊说，“这对他来说太残忍了，换作是你，你会怎么想？”

“我还是觉得他应该知道。”露西说，不过她俩的谈话被别人打断了。

那晚，大家就地而卧。我不知道阿斯兰如何找来食物的，只知道大约八点，所有人都坐在草地上享用精美的晚茶[15]。翌日，他们沿大河往东走，第三天大约也是晚饭时间，到达了河口。凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿高高屹立在他们头顶的一座小山上。他们面前是一片沙滩，岩石、小咸水坑、海藻点缀其中。大海的气息扑面而来，碧绿的海浪不断地拍打着海岸线。噢！还有海鸥的叫声！你听过海鸥的叫声吗？还能想起来吗？

晚饭过后，四个孩子全都再次跑到沙滩上，脱下鞋袜，感受脚趾间的沙子。但是第二天就较为严肃了，因为那一天，在凯尔帕拉维尔大殿内——那大殿气象宏伟，屋顶是象牙色的，西面墙上悬挂着孔雀羽毛，东边门向着大海——在他们所有朋友的见证下，在阵阵号角声中，阿斯兰庄严地为他们加冕。“彼得国王万岁！苏珊女王万岁！埃德蒙国王万岁！露西女王万岁！”在震耳欲聋的欢呼声中，阿斯兰将他们领到王座上。

“在纳尼亚一朝为王，就终身为王！好好记住，亚当之子！好好记住，夏娃之女！”阿斯兰说。

同时，从大大敞开的东门外，传来雄美人鱼和雌美人鱼的歌声，它们游到靠近海岸处，高声为新国王和新女王歌唱，以示敬意。

孩子们高坐在宝座上，接受了象征王位的权杖。他们给予所有朋友以奖励和荣耀，有半人羊塔姆纳斯先生、海狸夫妇、巨人吕波巴芬、猎豹、善良的半人马和小矮人，以及另一头狮子。那天晚上，凯尔帕拉维尔宫殿大设盛宴，欢饮歌舞、流光溢彩、美酒汩汩，大家尽情狂欢；殿外则传来交相呼应的人鱼音乐，它们的歌声更加动听，更加奇特，更有穿透力。

然而，就在大家狂欢庆祝的时候，阿斯兰悄悄地走了。国王与女王注意到他的消失时，也没有多说什么，因为海狸先生之前提醒过：“他来去不定，今天看见他，明天可能就见不到了。他不喜欢固定在一个地方，而且他还要照看其他国家。没关系，他会经常来的，只是不能强迫他。他性子狂野，你知道的，不像驯化的狮子。”

读到这里，你也明白了，故事已经接近尾声（但还没完哩）。两位国王和两位女王协同治理纳尼亚，那里长期安宁、快乐。刚上位时，他们大部分时间都花在寻找和铲除白女巫的党羽上。事实上过了一段时间，还是会时不时传来女巫余孽潜伏在森林偏僻地带的消息——不是这里闹鬼，就是那边有谁被害，或者这个月看见狼人，下个月又谣传看到巫婆。不过最后这些邪恶分子全都被消灭了。他们制定完善的律法，维护安定，保护好树木不被滥砍滥伐，释放被强制送入学校的年幼的小矮人和萨梯，禁止爱管闲事、说三道四的行为，鼓励普通百姓安居乐业。他们击退了从纳尼亚北部跨越疆界的凶猛巨人（他们和吕波巴芬巨人完全不是一类）；他们还与大海那边的国家建立友好外交，互结联盟，互相进行国事访问。时光荏苒，他们也渐渐长大，发生了转变：彼得成为一个高大、胸脯厚实的男人，还是一位勇猛的战士，他被称为彼得伟王；苏珊变成亭亭玉立、优雅十足的女人，她那黑黑的头发几乎垂到了脚边，海外诸国不断派来大使向她求婚，她被称为苏珊雅王；埃德蒙变得比彼得更加严肃、沉稳，善于议事与决断，他被称为埃德蒙义王；至于露西，她一直都是开心快乐的，还是一头金发，各个地方的王子都想娶她为王后，她被自己的子民称为露西骁王。

他们快乐地生活在纳尼亚，偶尔记起原本世界的生活，也只是如同人们想起自己曾做过的梦一样。有一年，塔姆纳斯（如今这只半人羊已步入中年，身材开始发福）顺河送信过来，称白鹿再一次出现在他的地盘。谁要是抓到那只白鹿，就能实现自己的愿望。于是，两位国王和两位女王率领朝中重要人员，带上号角和猎狗，一路往西部森林去追逐白鹿。没过多久就看见了白鹿的影子。它带领他们飞速穿过坎坷与平地，密林与空地，直到随从的马都疲乏了，他们四个还在追。他们看见那只白鹿钻进了一片密林，马儿无法继续向前，彼得王便说：“好伙伴，那我们就下马，进入密林，去抓那只野兽。我此生还从未捕过如此高贵的猎物。”（由于当国王、女王多年，他们各自说话的方式改变了许多。）

“陛下，”其他人说，“既然如此，我们就行动吧。”

于是，他们全都下马，将马拴到树上，然后走进茂密的树林。刚刚进去，苏珊女王就开口说：

“好朋友们，这里有一个壮观奇迹，因为我似乎看见了铁树。”

“陛下，”埃德蒙王说，“如果你仔细看，你会发现那不过是一根铁柱，顶上有个灯罩而已。”

“以狮鬃之名，这路灯真是奇怪，”彼得王说，“灯装在这里，周围全是茂盛高大的树，即使灯亮着也不能为任何人提供光亮啊！”

“陛下，”露西女王说，“兴许这柱子和灯安装时，周围都还是些小树苗，也可能没这么多树，甚至一棵树也没有，因为这片树林看起来年头不久，但铁柱已经很古老了。”大家站在那里望着那盏灯，这时埃德蒙王说话了：

“不知为何，但这柱上的灯给我一种异样的感觉，记忆里似乎在哪里见过，好像是在梦里，或者是在梦里的梦里。”

“陛下，”大家回应说，“我们也有这样的感觉。”

“不仅如此，”露西女王说，“我还有一个预感，如果我们走过去，经过这盏灯和灯柱，也许会遭遇各种奇妙的探险，或者我们的命运会发生很大变化。”

“陛下，”埃德蒙王说，“我心里也有同样的预感。”

“好兄弟，我也是。”彼得王说。

“我也是，”苏珊女王说，“鉴于此，我建议咱们就此打住，悄悄折回拴马的地方，不再追逐这头白鹿。”

“陛下，”彼得王说，“请恕我直言，自从我们四个当上国王与女王后，无论我们处理什么大事，诸如打仗、探险、军旅武艺、伸张正义之事，我们都没有半途而废过，凡是我们着手做的事情，最后都会成功。”

“姐姐，”露西女王说，“尊贵的皇兄所言极是，而且如果因为害怕或者心中预感就放弃追逐如此高贵的野兽，说来确实也羞愧。”

“我也这样想，”埃德蒙王说，“我心里特别想弄明白这到底意味着什么，即使拿纳尼亚最珍贵的珠宝和所有岛屿来换，我也绝不会折返。”

“那以阿斯兰的名义起誓，”苏珊女王说，“若诸位都这么想，我们就携手前进，迎接将要到来的探险吧。”

于是，这四位国王和女王继续前行，走向密林深处，还没走到二十步，大家都想起来了，他们所见的这个铁柱是灯柱，继续走不到二十步，他们发现周围不再是树枝，而是一堆衣服，下一刻几个人就发现自己骨碌碌从一个衣柜滚出，来到一个空房间里。他们不再是身着狩猎服的国王和女王，而只是穿着之前衣服的彼得、苏珊、埃德蒙和露西。这是他们躲进衣柜里的同一天、同一时刻。麦克雷迪太太和游客们依旧在过道里谈话，幸运的是他们没有走进这间空屋子，所以孩子们也没被逮住。

故事本该就此结束，但孩子们都觉得应该向老教授解释为何衣柜里少了四件大衣。没想到老教授如此开明，既没有说他们傻，也不认为他们是在说谎，而是相信了他们的整个故事。“不，”他说，“试图通过那扇衣柜门再次回去找衣服，我觉得这不是好主意。你们不能再通过那条路进入纳尼亚了，即使你们找到衣服，它们也没多大用处了。噢？我想说什么来着？对了，你们以后肯定还能回去。记住，在纳尼亚，一朝为王，终身为王。但同样的路线不能用两次，千万不要想方法进去。你不寻找，它自然会出现。还有啊，你们之间也不要经常谈论这件事，更不要对其他人提起，除非你知道他们也有类似的经历。什么意思？怎么辨别别人是否有类似经历？哈，你们到时候就知道了。他们说的奇怪的话——甚至表情——会泄露秘密，你们留心就是了。天啊，现在学校里都教些什么啊？”

衣柜奇旅就到此结束了，但如果老教授说对了的话，这只是纳尼亚奇遇的开始。





译后记


此时提笔，正是我所在地的夏季，繁花似锦，绿叶蓊郁，感觉万物争相舒展开来，用力呼吸、生长，以及享受生命。夏天给我的感觉，就像是书中描写森林狂欢的场景那样美好：“溪流里流淌的就不再是水，而是汩汩的红酒，整个树林狂欢起来，一直要持续好几个星期。”

但是冬天，尤其是漫长的冬天，却给人承受不来的压抑。那没有尽头的白雪，加上彻骨的寒冷，总让人觉得要尽快改变生活的样子才行；似乎万物都已沉睡，动物没了踪影，人们也少了欢愉。白女巫诅咒欢乐森林，让它变成“永远是冬天，而且没有圣诞节”。世上的酷刑大概莫过于如此。

每一个生活在纳尼亚的生灵一定都无比期待冬天赶紧结束。最开始是无奈的希冀，像是生活潦倒的人对往昔繁华人生的追忆，却无法从现实中找到翻身的可能，只能唏嘘过去的美好；然后发现坚硬的积雪开始融化，不知道是不是身边所有都开始好转，但心中的希望更加坚定；之后便是沿途的花儿开放，草地绿起来，胜利似乎正在前方——在这样的时刻，如若不是走过漫长的白色困境，“你很难想象在经历没有尽头的白色之后，再见到这些绿色的草地时，心里的那份舒畅！”

翻译此书，让我真真切切体会了那样“没有尽头的白色”和“舒畅”。住在渥太华，一场雪飘过，这里就变成了被女巫施过魔咒的世界。每翻完一个章节，望望窗外：总是飘着或大或小的雪，天地之间只有雪花簌簌的声响，和书里的景象很是相似。来年3月、4月到来之前，眼睛常常因为缺少彩色的滋润而疼痛，身体因漫长的冬季变得笨拙，出门还得踩着厚厚的雪。

就在我默默期盼和等待的时候，有一天早上醒来，意外听见屋檐雪水滴落的声音，急忙跑到屋外，看见那厚厚的雪路裂开了缝，一条条小小的细流欢快地流淌。我想我永远忘不了那一刻的狂喜心情。我知道，蛰伏这么久之后，定会有一个多姿美妙的春天，而且年年如是。

在我看来，一本书或是一个故事，多是由从生活中截取的一些片段加工而成。而这个在一块奇幻国土上演的故事，讲述的正是在经历默默期盼和等待之后，好事最终到来。而人的生命或许有许多这样的时刻，不知道美好的事情何时发生，但我们持续等待，持续前进，直到看见希望的曙光。我相信这个奇幻的故事，等待并最终圆满的过程，会引起大小读者的一点点共鸣。

TO LUCY BARFIELD


My Dear Lucy,

I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realised that girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still.But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again.You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it.I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand, a word you say, but I shall still be

your afectionate Godfather,

C. S.Lewis





CHAPTER 1 LUCY LOOKS INTO A WARDROBE


ONCE there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war because of the air-raids.They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post offce.He had no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs Macready and three servants.（Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, but they do not come into the story much.）He himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair which grew over most of his face as well as on his head, and they liked him almost at once;but on the frst evening when he came out to meet them at the front door he was so odd-looking that Lucy（who was the youngest）was a little afraid of him, and Edmund（who was the next youngest）wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he was blowing his nose to hide it.

As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the frst night, the boys came into the girls'room and they all talked it over.

“We've fallen on our feet and no mistake,”said Peter.“This is going to be perfectly splendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like.”

“I think he's an old dear,”said Susan.

“Oh, come off it!”said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be tired, which always made him bad-tempered.“Don't go on talking like that.”

“Like what?”said Susan;“and anyway, it's time you were in bed.”

“Trying to talk like Mother,”said Edmund.“And who are you to say when I'm to go to bed?Go to bed yourself.”

“Hadn't we all better go to bed?”said Lucy.“There's sure to be a row if we're heard talking here.”

“No there won't,”said Peter.“I tell you this is the sort of house where no one's going to mind what we do. Anyway, they won't hear us.It's about ten minutes'walk from here down to that dining-room, and any amount of stairs and passages in between.”

“What's that noise?”said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy.

“It's only a bird, silly,”said Edmund.

“It's an owl,”said Peter.“This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. I shall go to bed now.I say, let's go and explore tomorrow.You might fnd anything in a place like this.Did you see those mountains as we came along?And the woods?There might be eagles.There might be stags.There'll be hawks.”

“Badgers!”said Lucy.

“Foxes!”said Edmund.

“Rabbits!”said Susan.

But when next morning came there was a steady rain falling, so thick that when you looked out of the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden.

“Of course it would be raining!”said Edmund. They had just fnishedtheir breakfast with the Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them—a long, low room with two windows looking out in one direction and two in another.

“Do stop grumbling, Ed,”said Susan.“Ten to one it'll clear up in an hour or so. And in the meantime we're pretty well off.There's a wireless and lots of books.”

“Not for me,”said Peter;“I'm going to explore in the house.”

Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was the sort of house that you never seem to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places.The frst few doors they tried led only into spare bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would;but soon they came to a very long room full of pictures, and there they found a suit of armour;and after that was a room all hung with green, with a harp in one corner;and then came three steps down and fve steps up, and then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out on to a balcony, and then a whole series of rooms that led into each other and were lined with books—most of them very old books and some bigger than a Bible in a church.And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite empty except for one big wardrobe;the sort that has a looking-glass in the door.There was nothing else in the room at all except a dead bluebottle on the window-sill.

“Nothing there!”said Peter, and they all trooped out again—all except Lucy. She stayed behind because she thought it would be worth-while trying the door of the wardrobe, even though she felt almost sure that it would be locked.To her surprise it opened quite easily, and two moth-balls dropped out.

Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up—mostly long fur coats.

There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed her face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because she knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe.Soon she went further in and found that there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the frst one.It was almost quite dark in there and she kept her arms stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the wardrobe.She took a step further in—then two or three steps—always expecting to feel woodwork against the tips of her fngers.But she could not feel it.

“This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!”thought Lucy, going still further in and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that there was something crunching under her feet.“I wonder is that more mothballs?”she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hand.But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the foor of the wardrobe, she felt something soft and powdery and extremely cold.“This is very queer,”she said, and went on a step or two further.

Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly.“Why, it is just like branches of trees!”exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her;not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off.Something cold and soft was falling on her.A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowfakes falling through the air.

Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She looked back over her shoulder and there, between the dark tree-trunks;she could still see the open doorway of the wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out.（She had, of course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very silly thing toshut oneself into a wardrobe.）It seemed to be still daylight there.“I can always get back if anything goes wrong,”thought Lucy.She began to walk forward, crunch-crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light.In about ten minutes she reached it and found it was a lamp-post.As she stood looking at it, wondering why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter patter of feet coming towards her.And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among the trees into the light of the lamp-post.

He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella, white with snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shaped like a goat's（the hair on them was glossy black）and instead of feet he had goat's hoofs.He also had a tail, but Lucy did not notice this at frst because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it from trailing in the snow.He had a red woollen muffer round his neck, and his skin was rather reddish too.He had a strange, but pleasant little face, with a short pointed beard and curly hair, and out of the hair there stuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead.One of his hands, as I have said, held the umbrella;in the other arm he carried several brown-paper parcels.What with the parcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping.He was a Faun.And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcels.

“Goodness gracious me!”exclaimed the Faun.





CHAPTER 2 WHAT LUCY FOUND THERE


“GOOD EVENING,”said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up its parcels that at frst it did not reply.When it had fnished, it made her a little bow.

“Good evening, good evening,”said the Faun.“Excuse me—I don't want to be inquisitive—but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?”

“My name's Lucy,”said she, not quite understanding him.

“But you are—forgive me—you are what they call a girl?”said the Faun.

“Of course I'm a girl,”said Lucy.

“You are in fact Human?”

“Of course I'm human,”said Lucy, still a little puzzled.

“To be sure, to be sure,”said the Faun.“How stupid of me!But I've never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted.That is to say—”and then it stopped as if it had been going to say something it had not intended but had remembered in time.“Delighted, delighted,”it went on.“Allow me to introduce myself.My name is Tumnus.”

“I am very pleased to meet you, Mr Tumnus,”said Lucy.

“And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve,”said Mr Tumnus,“how you have come into Narnia?”

“Narnia?What's that?”said Lucy.

“This is the land of Narnia,”said the Faun,“where we are now;all that lies between the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you—you have come from the wild woods of the west?”

“I—I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room,”said Lucy.

“Ah!”said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice,“if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange countries. It is too late now.”

“But they aren't countries at all,”said Lucy, almost laughing.“It's only just back there—at least—I'm not sure. It is summer there.”

“Meanwhile,”said Mr Tumnus,“it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow. Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and had tea with me?”

“Thank you very much, Mr Tumnus,”said Lucy.“But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back.”

“It's only just round the corner,”said the Faun,“and there'll be a roaring fre—and toast—and sardines—and cake.”

“Well, it's very kind of you,”said Lucy.“But I shan't be able to stay long.”

“If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve,”said Mr Tumnus,“I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us. That's the way.Now—off we go.”

And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they had known one another all their lives.

They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus turned suddenlyaside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave.As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fre.Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a faming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp.“Now we shan't be long,”he said, and immediately put a kettle on.

Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the foor and two little chairs（“One for me and one for a friend,”said Mr Tumnus）and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fre and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard.In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus's bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of books.Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things.They had titles likeThe Life and Letters of Silenus orNymphs and Their Ways orMen, Monks and Gamekeepers;A Study in Popular Legend orIs Man a Myth?

“Now, Daughter of Eve!”said the Faun.

And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake.And when Lucy was tired of eating, the Faun began to talk.He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest.He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns;about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag who could give you wishes if you caught him;about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor;and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then thestreams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollifcation for weeks on end.“Not that it isn't always winter now,”he added gloomily.Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little fute that looked as if it were made of straw, and began to play.And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time.It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said:

“Oh, Mr Tumnus—I'm so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune—but really, I must go home. I only meant to stay for a few minutes.”

“It's no good now, you know,”said the Faun, laying down its fute and shaking its head at her very sorrowfully.

“No good?”said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened.“What do you mean?I've got to go home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me.”But a moment later she asked,“Mr Tumnus!Whatever is the matter?”for the Faun's brown eyes had flled with tears and then the tears began trickling down its cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of its nose;and at last it covered its face with its hands and began to howl.

“Mr Tumnus!Mr Tumnus!”said Lucy in great distress.“Don't!Don't!What is the matter?Aren't you well?Dear Mr Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong.”

But the Faun continued sobbing as if his heart would break. And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her handkerchief, he did not stop.He merely took the handker chief and kept on using it, wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch.

“Mr Tumnus!”bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him.“Do stop. Stop it at once!You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you.What on earth are you crying about?”

“Oh—oh—oh!”sobbed Mr Tumnus.“I'm crying because I'm such a bad Faun.”

“I don't think you're a bad Faun at all,”said Lucy.“I think you are a very good Faun. You are the nicest Faun I've ever met.”

“Oh—oh—you wouldn't say that if you knew,”replied Mr Tumnus between his sobs.“No, I'm a bad Faun. I don't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world.”

“But what have you done?”asked Lucy.

“My old father, now,”said Mr Tumnus;“that's his picture over the mantelpiece. He would never have done a thing like this.”

“A thing like what?”said Lucy.

“Like what I've done,”said the Faun.“Taken service under the White Witch. That's what I am.I'm in the pay of the White Witch.”

“The White Witch?Who is she?”

“Why, it is she who has got all Narnia under her thumb. It's she who makes it always winter.Always winter and never Christmas;think of that!”

“How awful!”said Lucy.“But what does she payyou for?”

“That's the worst of it,”said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan.“I'm a kidnapper for her, that's what I am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve.Would you believe that I'm the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood, one that had never done me any harm, and pretend to be friendly with it, and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch?”

“No,”said Lucy.“I'm sure you wouldn't do anything of the sort.”

“But I have,”said the Faun.

“Well,”said Lucy rather slowly（for she wanted to be truthful and yet not be too hard on him），“well, that was pretty bad. But you're so sorry for it that I'm sure you will never do it again.”

“Daughter of Eve, don't you understand?”said the Faun.“It isn't something Ihave done. I'm doing it now, this very moment.”

“What do you mean?”cried Lucy, turning very white.

“You are the child,”said Tumnus.“I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch them and hand them over to her. And you are the frst I've ever met.And I've pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea, and all the time I've been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tellHer.”

“Oh, but you won't, Mr Tumnus,”said Lucy.“Yo won't, will you?Indeed, indeed you really mustn't.”

“And if I don't,”said he, beginning to cry again,“she's sure to fnd out. And she'll have my tail cut off, and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she'll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like wretched horse's.And if she is extra and specially angry she'll turn me into stone and I shall be only statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are flled—and goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever happen at all.”

“I'm very sorry, Mr Tumnus,”said Lucy.“But please let me go home.”

“Of course I will,”said the Faun.“Of course I've got to. I see that now.I hadn't known what Humans were like before I met you.Of course I can't give you up to the Witch, not now that I know you.But we must be off at once.I'll see you back to the lamp-post.I suppose you can fnd your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?”

“I'm sure I can,”said Lucy.

“We must go as quietly as we can,”said Mr Tumnus.“The whole wood is full ofher spies. Even some of the trees are on her side.”

They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun's cave;they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest places.Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp-post again.

“Do you know your way from here, Daughter of Eve?”said Tumnus.

Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight.“Yes,”she said,“I can see the wardrobe door.”

“Then be off home as quick as you can,”said the Faun,“and—c—can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do?”

“Why, of course I can,”said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand.“And I do hope you won't get into dreadful trouble on my account.”

“Farewell, Daughter of Eve,”said he.“Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?”

“Rather!”said Lucy, and then ran towards the far-off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her. And presently instead of rough branches brushing past her she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden boards, and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started.She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around, panting for breath.It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage.

“I'm here,”she shouted.“I'm here. I've come back I'm all right.”





CHAPTER 3 EDMUND AND THE WARDROBE


LUCY ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three.

“It's all right,”she repeated,“I've come back.”

“What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?”asked Susan.

“Why,”said Lucy in amazement,“haven't you all been wondering where I was?”

“So you've been hiding, have you?”said Peter.“Poor old Lu, hiding and nobody noticed!You'll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you.”

“But I've been away for hours and hours,”said Lucy.

The others all stared at one another.

“Batty!”said Edmund, tapping his head.“Quite batty.”

“What do you mean, Lu?”asked Peter.

“What I said,”answered Lucy.“It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe, and I've been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and all sorts of things have happened.”

“Don't be silly, Lucy,”said Susan.“We've only just come out of that room a moment ago, and you were there then.”

“She's not being silly at all,”said Peter,“she's just making up a story for fun, aren't you, Lu?And why shouldn't she?”

“No, Peter, I'm not,”she said.“It's—it's a magic wardrobe. There'sa wood inside it, and it's snowing, and there's a Faun and a Witch and it's called Narnia;come and see.”

The others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that they all went back with her into the room. She rushed ahead of them, fung open the door of the wardrobe and cried,“Now!go in and see for yourselves.”

“Why, you goose,”said Susan, putting her head inside and pulling the fur coats apart,“it's just an ordinary wardrobe;look!there's the back of it.”

Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart;and they all saw—Lucy herself saw—a perfectly ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and no snow, only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it.Peter went in and rapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.

“A jolly good hoax, Lu,”he said as he came out again;“you have really taken us in, I must admit. We half believed you.”

“But it wasn't a hoax at all,”said Lucy,“really and truly. It was all different a moment ago.Honestly it was.I promise.”

“Come, Lu,”said Peter,“that's going a bit far. You've had your joke.Hadn't you better drop it now?”

Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she hardly knew what she was trying to say, and burst into tears.

For the next few days she was very miserable. She could have made it up with the others quite easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing was only a story made up for fun.But Lucy was a very truthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right;and she could not bring herself to say this.The others who thought she was telling a lie, and a silly lie too, made her very unhappy.The two elder ones did this without meaning to do it, but Edmund could be spiteful, and on this occasion he was spiteful.He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kepton asking her if she'd found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the house.What made it worse was that these days ought to have been delightful.The weather was fine and they were out of doors from morning to night, bathing, fshing, climbing trees, and lying in the heather.But Lucy could not properly enjoy any of it.And so things went on until the next wet day.

That day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a break in the weather, they decided to play hide-and-seek. Susan was“It”and as soon as the others scattered to hide, Lucy went to the room where the wardrobe was.She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she knew that would only set the others talking again about the whole wretched business.But she did want to have one more look inside it;for by this time she was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia and the Faun had not been a dream.The house was so large and complicated and full of hiding-places that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere else.But as soon as she reached it she heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothing for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her.She did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.

Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund;and he came into the room just in time to see Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He at once decided to get into it himself—not because he thought it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary country.He opened the door.There were the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell of mothballs, and darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy.“She thinks I'm Susan come to catch her,”said Edmund to himself,“and so she's keeping very quiet in at the back.”He jumped in and shut the door, forgetting what a very foolish thing this isto do.Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark.He had expected to fnd her in a few seconds and was very surprised when he did not.He decided to open the door again and let in some light.But he could not fnd the door either.He didn't like this at all and began groping wildly in every direction;he even shouted out,“Lucy!Lu!Where are you?I know you're here.”

There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound—not the sound you expect in a cupboard, but a kind of open-air sound. He also noticed that he was unexpectedly cold;and then he saw a light.

“Thank goodness,”said Edmund,“the door must have swung open of its own accord.”He forgot all about Lucy and went towards the light, which he thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But instead of fnding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the shadow of some thick dark fr trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.

There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees. Overhead there was pale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fne winter day in the morning.Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree-trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear.Everything was perfectly still, as if he were the only living creature in that country.There was not even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he could see in every direction.He shivered.

He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy:and also how unpleasant he had been to her about her“imaginary country”which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all. He thought that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted,“Lucy!Lucy!I'm here too—Edmund.”

There was no answer.

“She's angry about all the things I've been saying lately,”thought Edmund. And though he did not like to admit that he had been wrong, he also did not much like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet place;so he shouted again:

“I say, Lu!I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I see now you were right all along.Do come out.Make it Pax.”

Still there was no answer.

“Just like a girl,”said Edmund to himself,“sulking somewhere, and won't accept an apology.”He looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place, and had almost made up his mind to go home, when he heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He listened and the sound came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.

The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow hardly looked white compared with them;their branching horns were gilded and shone like something on fre when the sunrise caught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered with bells.On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet high if he had been standing.He was dressed in polar bear's fur and on his head he wore a red hood with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point;his huge beard covered his knees and served him instead of a rug.But behind him, on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very different person—a great lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen.She also was covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore a golden crown on her head.Her face was white—not merely pale, but white like snow or paper or icing-sugar, except for her very red mouth.It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and cold and stern.

The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmundwith the bells jingling and the dwarf cracking his whip and the snow fying up on each side of it.

“Stop!”said the Lady, and the dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharply that they almost sat down. Then they recovered themselves and stood champing their bits and blowing.In the frosty air the breath coming out of their nostrils looked like smoke.

“And what, pray, are you?”said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.

“I'm—I'm—my name's Edmund,”said Edmund rather awkwardly. He did not like the way she looked at him.

The Lady frowned,“Is that how you address a Queen?”she asked, looking sterner than ever.

“I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn't know,”said Edmund:

“Not know the Queen of Narnia?”cried she.“Ha!You shall know us better hereafter. But I repeat—what are you?”

“Please, your Majesty,”said Edmund,“I don't know what you mean. I'm at school—at least I was—it's the holidays now.”





CHAPTER 4 TURKISH DELIGHT


“BUT what are you?”said the Queen again.“Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard?”

“No, your Majesty,”said Edmund,“I never had a beard, I'm a boy.”

“A boy!”said she.“Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?”

Edmund stood still, saying nothing. He was too confused by this time to understand what the question meant.

“I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be,”said the Queen.“Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?”

“Yes, your Majesty,”said Edmund.

“And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?”

“Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe.”

“A wardrobe?What do you mean?”

“I—I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty,”said Edmund.

“Ha!”said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him.“A door. A door from the world of men!I have heard of such things.This may wreck all.But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with.”As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes faming;at the same moment she raised her wand.Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable tomove.Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.

“My poor child,”she said in quite a different voice,“how cold you look!Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle round you and we will talk.”

Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey;he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle round him and tucked it well in.

“Perhaps something hot to drink?”said the Queen.“Should you like that?”

“Yes, please, your Majesty,”said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.

The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm, she let one drop fall from it on the snow beside the sledge.Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond.But the moment it touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed.The dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile;not a very nice smile.Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink.It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.

“It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,”said the Queen presently.“What would you like best to eat?”

“Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,”said Edmund.

The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious.He was quite warm now, andvery comfortable.

While he was eating, the Queen kept asking him questions. At frst Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive.She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia.She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming back to it.“You are sure there are just four of you?”she asked.“Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?”and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying,“Yes, I told you that before,”and forgetting to call her“Your Majesty”，but she didn't seem to mind now.

At last the Turkish Delight was all fnished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking;for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves.But she did not offer him any more.Instead, she said to him,

“Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?”

“I'll try,”said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.

“Because, if you did come again—bringing them with you of course—I'd be able to give you some more Turkish Delight. I can't do it now, the magic will only work once.In my own house it would be another matter.”

“Why can't we go to your house now?”said Edmund. When he had frst got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back;but he had forgotten about that fear now.

“It is a lovely place, my house,”said the Queen.“I am sure you would like it. There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what's more, I have no children of my own.I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone.While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long;and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I've ever met.I think I would like to make you the Prince—some day, when you bring the others to visit me.”

“Why not now?”said Edmund. His face had become very red and his mouth and fngers were sticky.He did not look either clever or handsome, whatever the Queen might say.

“Oh, but if I took you there now,”said she,“I shouldn't see your brother and your sisters. I very much want to know your charming relations.You are to be the Prince and—later on—the King;that is understood.But you must have courtiers and nobles.I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters Duchesses.”

“There's nothing special aboutthem,”said Edmund,“and, anyway, I could always bring them some other time.”

“Ah, but once you were in my house,”said the Queen,“you might forget all about them. You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn't want the bother of going to fetch them.No.You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you understand.It is no good coming without them.”

“But I don't even know the way back to my own country,”pleaded Edmund.

“That's easy,”answered the Queen.“Do you see that lamp?”She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp-post under which Lucy had met the Faun.“Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of Men. And now look the other way”—here she pointed in the opposite direction—“and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees.”

“I think I can,”said Edmund.

“Well, my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you have only to fnd the lamp-post and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house.But remember—you must bring the others with you.I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone.”

“I'll do my best,”said Edmund.

“And, by the way,”said the Queen,“you needn't tell them about me. It would be fun to keep it a secret between us two, wouldn't it?Make it a surprise for them.Just bring them along to the two hills—a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that—and when you come to my house you could just say,‘Let's see who lives here'，or something like that.I am sure that would be best.If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may have heard strange stories about me—nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me.Fauns will say anything, you know, and now—”

“Please, please,”said Edmund suddenly,“please couldn't I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home?”

“No, no,”said the Queen with a laugh,“you must wait till next time.”While she spoke, she signalled to the dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund, calling out,“Next time!Next time!Don't forget. Come soon.”

Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someonecalling his own name, and looking round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood.

“Oh, Edmund!”she cried.“So you've got in too!Isn't it wonderful, and now—”

“All right,”said Edmund,“I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all. I'll say I'm sorry if you like.But where on earth have you been all this time?I've been looking for you everywhere.”

“If I'd known you had got in I'd have waited for you,”said Lucy, who was too happy and excited to notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face was.“I've been having lunch with dear Mr Tumnus, the Faun, and he's very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting me go, so he thinks she can't have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all.”

“The White Witch?”said Edmund;“who's she?”

“She is a perfectly terrible person,”said Lucy.“She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals—at least all the good ones—simply hate her. And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things.And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia—always winter, but it never gets to Christmas.And she drives about on a sledge, drawn by reindeer, with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head.”

Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets, and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.

“Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?”he asked.

“Mr Tumnus, the Faun,”said Lucy.

“You can't always believe what Fauns say,”said Edmund, trying to sound as if he knew far more about them than Lucy.

“Who said so?”asked Lucy.

“Everyone knows it,”said Edmund;“ask anybody you like. But it's pretty poor sport standing here in the snow.Let's go home.”

“Yes, let's,”said Lucy.“Oh, Edmund, I am glad you've got in too. The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there.What fun it will be!”

But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as for her. He would have to admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animals;but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch.He did not know what he would say, or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia.

By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room.

“I say,”said Lucy,“you do look awful, Edmund. Don't you feel well?”

“I'm all right,”said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very sick.

“Come on then,”said Lucy,“let's fnd the others. What a lot we shall have to tell them!And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we're all in it together.”





CHAPTER 5 BACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE DOOR


BECAUSE the game of hide-and-seek was still going on, it took Edmund and Lucy some time to find the others. But when at last they were all together（which happened in the long room, where the suit of armour was）Lucy burst out:

“Peter!Susan!It's all true. Edmund has seen it too.There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe.Edmund and I both got in.We met one another in there, in the wood.Go on, Edmund;tell them all about it.”

“What's all this about, Ed?”said Peter.

And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that moment Edmund had been feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but he hadn't made up his mind what to do.When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most spiteful thing he could think of.He decided to let Lucy down.

“Tell us, Ed,”said Susan.

And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy（there was really only a year's difference）and then a little snigger and said,“Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing—pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true. Just for fun, of course.There's nothing there really.”

Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.

Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he had scored a great success, and went on at once to say,“There she goes again. What's the matter with her?That's the worst of young kids, they always—”

“Look here,”said Peter, turning on him savagely,“shut up!You've been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe, and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite.”

“But it's all nonsense,”said Edmund, very taken aback.

“Of course it's all nonsense,”said Peter,“that's just the point. Lu was perfectly all right when we left home, but since we've been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar.But whichever it is, what good do you think you'll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next?”

“I thought—I thought—”said Edmund;but he couldn't think of anything to say.

“You didn't think anything at all,”said Peter;“it's just spite. You've always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself;we've seen that at school before now.”

“Do stop it,”said Susan;“it won't make things any better having a row between you two. Let's go and fnd Lucy.”

It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyone could see that she had been crying. Nothing they could say to her made any difference.She stuck to her story and said:

“I don't care what you think, and I don't care what you say. You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like.I know I've met a Faun in there and—I wish I'd stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts.”

It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel that his plan wasn't working as well as he had expected.The two older ones were really beginning to think that Lucy was out of her mind.They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she had gone to bed.

The result was the next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to the Professor.“He'll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu,”said Peter;“it's getting beyond us.”So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said,“Come in,”and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal. Then he sat listening to them with the tips of his fngers pressed together and never interrupting, till they had fnished the whole story.After that he said nothing for quite a long time.Then he cleared his throat and said the last thing either of them expected:

“How do you know,”he asked,“that your sister's story is not true?”

“Oh, but—”began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man's face that he was perfectly serious.Then Susan pulled herself together and said,“But Edmund said they had only been pretending.”

“That is a point,”said the Professor,“which certainly deserves consideration;very careful consideration. For instance—if you will excuse me for asking the question—does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable?I mean, which is the more truthful?”

“That's just the funny thing about it, sir,”said Peter.“Up till now, I'd have said Lucy every time.”

“And what do you think, my dear?”said the Professor, turning to Susan.

“Well,”said Susan,“in general, I'd say the same as Peter, but this couldn't be true—all this about the wood and the Faun.”

“That is more than I know,”said the Professor,“and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing;a very serious thing indeed.”

“We were afraid it mightn't even be lying,”said Susan;“we thought there might be something wrong with Lucy.”

“Madness, you mean?”said the Professor quite coolly.“Oh, you can make your minds easy about that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad.”

“But then,”said Susan, and stopped. She had never dreamed that a grown-up would talk like the Professor and didn't know what to think.

“Logic!”said the Professor half to himself.“Why don't they teach logic at these schools?There are only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she is telling the truth.You know she doesn't tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad.For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth.”

Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that he was no making fun of them.

“But how could it be true, sir?”said Peter.

“Why do you say that?”asked the Professor.

“Well, for one thing,”said Peter,“if it was real why doesn't everyone fnd this country every time they go to the wardrobe?I mean, there was nothing there when we looked;even Lucy didn't pretend the was.”

“What has that to do with it?”said the Professor.

“Well, sir, if things are real, they're there all the time.”

“Are they?”said the Professor;and Peter did not know quite what to say.

“But there was no time,”said Susan.“Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere, even if there was such a place. She came running after usthe very moment we were out of the room.It was less than minute, and she pretended to have been away for hours.”

“That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true,”said the Professor.“If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other world（and I should warn you that this is a very strange house, and even I know very little about it）—if, I say, she had got into another world, I should not be at all surprised to fnd that the other world had a separate time of its own;so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time. On the other hand, I don't think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves.If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story.”

“But do you really mean, sir,”said Peter,“that there could be other worlds—all over the place, just round the corner—like that?”

“Nothing is more probable,”said the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish them, while he muttered to himself,“I wonder what theydo teach them at these schools.”

“But what are we to do?”said Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the point.

“My dear young lady,”said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both of them,“there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying.”

“What's that?”said Susan.

“We might all try minding our own business,”said he. And that was the end of that conversation.

After this, things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all.It had become a rather alarming subject.And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming toan end;but that was not to be.

This house of the Professor's—which even he knew so little about—was so old and famous that people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it. It was the sort of house that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories;and well it might be, for all manner of stories were told about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now.And when parties of sightseers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs Macready, the housekeeper, showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and the rare books in the library.Mrs Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to be interrupted when she was telling visitors all the things she knew.She had said to Susan and Peter almost on the frst morning（along with a good many other instructions），“And please remember you're to keep out of the way whenever I'm taking a party over the house.”

“Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown-ups!”said Edmund, and the other three thought the same. That was how the adventures began for the second time.

A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said,“Look out!Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her.”

“Sharp's the word,”said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room. But when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the Library, they suddenly heard voices ahead of them, and realised that Mrs Macready must be bringing her party of sightseers up the back stairs—instead of up the front stairs as they had expected.And after that—whether it was that they lost their heads, orthat Mrs Macready was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia—they seemed to fnd themselves being followed everywhere, until at last Susan said,“Oh bother those trippers!Here—let's get into the Wardrobe Room till they've passed.No one will follow us in there.”But the moment they were inside they heard the voices in the passage—and then someone fumbling at the door—and then they saw the handle turning.

“Quick!”said Peter,“there's nowhere else,”and flung open the wardrobe. All four of them bundled inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark.Peter held the door closed but did not shut it;for, of course, he remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never, never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.





CHAPTER 6 INTO THE FOREST


“I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away,”said Susan presently,“I'm getting horribly cramped.”

“And what a flthy smell of camphor!”said Edmund.

“I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it,”said Susan,“to keep away the moths.”

“There's something sticking into my back,”said Peter.

“And isn't it cold?”said Susan.

“Now that you mention it, it is cold,”said Peter,“and hang it all, it's wet too. What's the matter with this place?I'm sitting on something wet.It's getting wetter every minute.”He struggled to his feet.

“Let's get out,”said Edmund,“they've gone.”

“O-o-oh!”said Susan suddenly, and everyone asked her what was the matter.

“I'm sitting against a tree,”said Susan,“and look!It's getting light—over there.”

“By Jove, you're right,”said Peter,“and look there—and there. It's trees all round.And this wet stuff is snow.Why, I do believe we've got into Lucy's wood after all.”

And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front of them were snow-covered trees.

Peter turned at once to Lucy.

“I apologize for not believing you,”he said,“I'm sorry. Will you shake hands?”

“Of course,”said Lucy, and did.

“And now,”said Susan,“what do we do next?”

“Do?”said Peter,“why, go and explore the wood, of course.”

“Ugh!”said Susan, stamping her feet,“it's pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?”

“They're not ours,”said Peter doubtfully.

“I am sure nobody would mind,”said Susan;“it isn't as if we wanted to take them out of the house;we shan't take them even out of the wardrobe.”

“I never thought of that, Su,”said Peter.“Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it.And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe.”

They immediately carried out Susan's very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on.But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get-up and more suitable to the landscape.

“We can pretend we are Arctic explorers,”said Lucy.

“This is going to be exciting enough without pretending,”said Peter, as he began leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy, darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.

“I say,”began Edmund presently,“oughtn't we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post?”He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in thewood before. The moment the words were out of his mouth he realised that he had given himself away.Everyone stopped;everyone stared at him.Peter whistled.

“So you really were here,”he said,“that time Lu said she'd met you in here—and you made out she was telling lies.”

There was a dead silence.“Well, of all the poisonous little beasts—”said Peter, and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say, and presently the four resumed their journey;but Edmund was saying to himself,“I'll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up, self-satisfed prigs.”

“Where are we going anyway?”said Susan, chiefy for the sake of changing the subject.

“I think Lu ought to be the leader,”said Peter;“Goodness knows she deserves it. Where will you take us, Lu?”

“What about going to see Mr Tumnus?”said Lucy.“He's the nice Faun I told you about.”

Everyone agreed to this and off they went, walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a good leader.At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way, but she recognized an oddlooking tree in one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus's cave.But there a terrible surprise awaited them.

The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days.Snow had drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the foor, mixed with something black, which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fre.Someone had apparently fung it about the room and then stamped it out.The crockerylay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun's father had been slashed into shreds with a knife.

“This is a pretty good wash-out,”said Edmund;“not much good coming here.”

“What is this?”said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been nailed through the carpet to the foor.

“Is there anything written on it?”asked Susan.

“Yes, I think there is,”answered Peter,“but I can't read it in this light. Let's get out into the open air.”

They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out the following words:

The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc.，also of comforting her said Majesty's enemies, harbouring spies and fraternizing with Humans.

signed MAUGRIM, Captain of the Secret Police,

LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!

The children stared at each other.

“I don't know that I'm going to like this place after all,”said Susan.

“Who is this Queen, Lu?”said Peter.“Do you know anything about her?”

“She isn't a real queen at all,”answered Lucy;“she's a horrible witch, the White Witch. Everyone—all the wood people—hate her.She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas.”

“I—I wonder if there's any point in going on,”said Susan.“I mean, it doesn't seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it won't be much fun either. And it's getting colder every minute, and we've brought nothing to eat.What about just going home?”

“Oh, but we can't, we can't,”said Lucy suddenly;“don't you see?We can't just go home, not after this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble.He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back.That's what it means by comforting the Queen's enemies and fraternizing with Humans.We simply must try to rescue him.”

“A lot we could do!said Edmund,“when we haven't even got anything to eat!”

“Shut up—you!”said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund.“What do you think, Susan?”

“I've a horrid feeling that Lu is right,”said Susan.“I don't want to go a step further and I wish we'd never come. But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever-his-name is—I mean the Faun.”

“That's what I feel too,”said Peter.“I'm worried about having no food with us. I'd vote for going back and getting something from the larder, only there doesn't seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you've got out of it.I think we'll have to go on.”

“So do I,”said both the girls.

“If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!”said Peter.

They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said,“Look!There's a robin, with such a red breast. It's the frst bird I've seen here.I say!—I wonder can birds talk in Narnia?It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us.”Then she turned to the Robin and said,“Please, can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?”As she said this she took a step towards the bird.It at once flew away but only as far as to the next tree.There it perched and looked at them veryhard as if it understood all they had been saying.Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four children went a step or two nearer to it.At this the Robin few away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard.（You couldn't have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye.）

“Do you know,”said Lucy,“I really believe he means us to follow him.”

“I've an idea he does,”said Susan.“What do you think, Peter?”

“Well, we might as well try it,”answered Peter.

The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them, but always so near that they could easily follow it.In this way it led them on, slightly downhill.Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch.Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright.They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in front, when Edmund said to Peter,“If you're not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I've something to say which you'd better listen to.”

“What is it?”asked Peter.

“Hush!Not so loud,”said Edmund;“there's no good frightening the girls. But have you realised what we're doing?”

“What?”said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.

“We're following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on?Why shouldn't it be leading us into a trap?”

“That's a nasty idea. Still—a robin, you know.They're good birds in all the stories I've ever read.I'm sure a robin wouldn't be on the wrong side.”

“It if comes to that, which is the right side?How do we know that theFauns are in the right and the Queen（yes, I know we've beentold she's a witch）is in the wrong?We don't really know anything about either.”

“The Faun saved Lucy.”

“He said he did. But how do we know?And there's another thing too.Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here?”

“Great Scott!”said Peter,“I hadn't thought of that.”

“And no chance of dinner either,”said Edmund.





CHAPTER 7 A DAY WITH THE BEAVERS


WHILE the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried“Oh!”and stopped.

“The robin!”cried Lucy,“the robin. It's flown away.”And so it had—right out of sight.

“And now what are we to do?”said Edmund, giving Peter a look which was as much as to say,“What did I tell you?”

“Sh!Look!”said Susan.

“What?”said Peter.

“There's something moving among the trees over there to the left.”

They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.

“There it goes again,”said Susan presently.

“I saw it that time too,”said Peter.“It's still there. It's just gone behind that big tree.”

“What is it?”asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.

“Whatever it is,”said Peter,“it's dodging us. It's something that doesn't want to be seen.”

“Let's go home,”said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud, everyone suddenly realised the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter.They were lost.

“What's it like?”said Lucy.

“It's—it's a kind of animal,”said Susan;and then,“Look!Look!Quick!There it is.”

They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree. But this time it didn't immediately draw back.Instead, the animal put its paw against its mouth just as humans put their fnger on their lips when they are signalling to you to be quiet.Then it disappeared again.The children all stood holding their breath.

A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all round as if it were afraid someone was watching, said“Hush”，made signs to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it was standing, and then once more disappeared.

“I know what it is,”said Peter;“it's a beaver. I saw the tail.”

“It wants us to go to it,”said Susan,“and it is warning us not to make a noise.”

“I know,”said Peter.“The question is, are we to go to it or not?What do you think, Lu?”

“I think it's a nice beaver,”said Lucy.

“Yes, but how do weknow?”said Edmund.

“Shan't we have to risk it?”said Susan.“I mean, it's no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner.”

At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to them.

“Come on,”said Peter,”let's give it a try. All keep close together.We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy.”

So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it, and there, sure enough, they found the Beaver;but it still drew back, saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper,“Further in, come further in. Right in here.We're not safe in the open!”Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that theirboughs met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to fall there, did it begin to talk to them.

“Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?”it said.

“We're some of them,”said Peter.

“S-s-s-sh!”said the Beaver,“not so loud please. We're not safe even here.”

“Why, who are you afraid of?”said Peter.“There's no one here but ourselves.”

“There are the trees,”said the Beaver.“They're always listening. Most of them are on our side, but there are trees that would betray us to her;you know who I mean,”and it nodded its head several times.

“If it comes to talking about sides,”said Edmund,“how do we know you're a friend?”

“Not meaning to be rude, Mr Beaver,”added Peter,“but you see, we're strangers.”

“Quite right, quite right,”said the Beaver.“Here is my token.”With these words it held up to them a little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, till suddenly Lucy said,“Oh, of course.It's my handkerchief—the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus.”

“That's right,”said the Beaver.“Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me. He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to—”Here the Beaver's voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods.Then, signalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could, so that their faces were actually tickled by its whiskers, it added in a low whisper—

“They say Aslan is on the move—perhaps has already landed.”

And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do;but the moment the Beaver hadspoken these words everyone felt quite different.Perhaps it has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don't understand but in the dream it feels as if it has some enormous meaning—either a terrifying one which turns the whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that dream again.It was like that now.At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump in its inside.Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror.Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous.Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just foated by her.And Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realise that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of summer.

“And what about Mr Tumnus,”said Lucy;“where is he?”

“S-s-s-sh,”said the Beaver,“not here. I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner.”

No one except Edmund felt any diffculty about trusting the Beaver now, and everyone, including Edmund, was very glad to hear the word“dinner”. They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace, and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over an hour.Everyone was feeling very tired and very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall steeply downhill.A minute later they came out under the open sky（the sun was still shining）and found themselves looking down on a fne sight.

They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom of which ran—at least it would have been running if it hadn't been frozen—a fairly large river. Just below them a dam had been built across this river, and when they saw it everyone suddenly rememberedthat of course beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr Beaver had made this one.They also noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his face—the sort of look people have when you are visiting a garden they've made or reading a story they've written.So it was only common politeness when Susan said,“What a lovely dam!”And Mr Beaver didn't say,“Hush”this time but,“Merely a trife!Merely a trife!And it isn't really fnished!”

Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now, of course, a level foor of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down, was more ice, but instead of being smooth this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the very moment when the frost came.And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over with fowers and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar.And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive, and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it（especially if you were hungry）you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.

That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed something else. A little lower down the river there was another small river which came down another small valley to join it.And looking up that valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and he was almost sure they were the two hills which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp-post that other day.And then between them, he thought, must be her palace, only a mile off or less.And he thought about Turkish Delight and about being a King（“And I wonder how Peter will like that?”he asked himself）and horrible ideas came into his head.

“Here we are,”said Mr Beaver,“and it looks as if Mrs Beaver isexpecting us. I'll lead the way.But be careful and don't slip.”

The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not（for humans）a very nice place to walk because it was covered with ice, and though the frozen pool was level with it on one side, there was a nasty drop to the lower river on the other. Along this route Mr Beaver led them in single fle right out to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it.And when they had reached the middle they were at the door of the house.

“Here we are, Mrs Beaver,”said Mr Beaver,“I've found them. Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve”—and they all went in.

The frst thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the first thing she saw was a kindlooking old she-beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her sewing machine, and it was from it that the sound came. She stopped her work and got up as soon as the children came in.

“So you've come at last!”she said, holding out both her wrinkled old paws.“At last!To think that ever I should live to see this day!The potatoes are boiling and the kettle's singing and I daresay, Mr Beaver, you'll get us some fsh.”

“That I will,”said Mr Beaver, and he went out of the house（Peter went with him），and across the ice of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet. They took a pail with them.Mr Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole（he didn't seem to mind it being so chilly），looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in his paw, and before you could say Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout.Then he did it all over again until they had a fne catch of fsh.

Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs Beaver to fll the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread and put the plates in the oven to heat anddraw a huge jug of beer for Mr Beaver from a barrel which stood in one corner of the house, and to put on the frying-pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy thought the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like Mr Tumnus's cave.There were no books or pictures, and instead of beds there were bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall.And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof, and against the walls were gumboots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying mortar in and fshing-rods and fshing-nets and sacks.And the cloth on the table, though very clean, was very rough.

Just as the frying-pan was nicely hissing, Peter and Mr Beaver came in with the fsh which Mr Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air. You can think how good the new-caught fsh smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for them to be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mr Beaver said,“Now we're nearly ready.”Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few minutes everyone was drawing up their stools（it was all three-legged stools in the Beavers'house except for Mrs Beaver's own special rocking-chair beside the fire）and preparing to enjoy themselves.There was a jug of creamy milk for the children（Mr Beaver stuck to beer）and a great big lump of deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took as much as he wanted to go with his potatoes, and all the children thought—and I agree with them—that there's nothing to beat good freshwater fsh if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan half a minute ago.And when they had fnished the fsh Mrs Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the sametime moved the kettle onto the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made and ready to be poured out.And when each person had got his（or her）cup of tea, each person shoved back his（or her）stool so as to be able to lean against the wall, and gave a long sigh of contentment.

“And now,”said Mr Beaver, pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards him,“if you'll just wait till I've got my pipe lit up and going nicely—why, now we can get to business. It's snowing again,”he added, cocking his eye at the window.“That's all the better, because it means we shan't have any visitors;and if anyone should have been trying to follow you, why he won't fnd any tracks.”





CHAPTER 8 WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DINNER


“AND now,”said Lucy,“do please tell us what's happened to Mr Tumnus.”

“Ah, that's bad,”said Mr Beaver, shaking his head.“That's a very, very bad business. There's no doubt he was taken off by the police.I got that from a bird who saw it done.”

“But where's he been taken to?”asked Lucy.

“Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen, and we all know what that means.”

“No, we don't,”said Susan.

Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion.“I'm afraid it means they were taking him to her House,”he said.

“But what'll they do to him, Mr Beaver?”gasped Lucy.

“Well,”said Mr Beaver,“you can't exactly say for sure. But there's not many taken in there that ever comes out again.Statues.All full of statues they say it is—in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall.People she's turned”—（he paused and shuddered）—“turned into stone.”

“But, Mr Beaver,”said Lucy,“can't we—I mean, we must do something to save him. It's too dreadful and it's all on my account.”

“I don't doubt you'd save him if you could, dearie,”said Mrs Beaver,“but you've no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive.”

“Couldn't we have some stratagem?”said Peter.“I mean, couldn't we dress up as something, or pretend to be—oh, pedlars or anything—or watch till she was gone out—or—oh, hang it all, there must besome way. This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, Mr Beaver.We can't just leave him to be—to be—to have that done to him.”

“It's no good, Son of Adam,”said Mr Beaver,“no goodyour trying, of all people. But now that Aslan is on the move—”

“Oh, yes!Tell us about Aslan!”said several voices at once, for once again that strange feeling—like the frst signs of spring, like good news—had come over them.

“Who is Aslan?”asked Susan.

“Aslan?”said Mr Beaver.“Why, don't you know?He's the King. He's the Lord of the whole wood, but not often here, you understand.Never in my time or my father's time.But the word has reached us that he has come back.He is in Narnia at this moment.He'll settle the White Queen all right.It is he, not you, that will save Mr Tumnus.”

“She won't turn him into stone too?”said Edmund.

“Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!”answered Mr Beaver with a great laugh.“Turn him into stone?If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it'll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her. No, no.He'll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:

Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,

At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,

When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,

And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.

You'll understand when you see him.”

“But shall we see him?”asked Susan.

“Why, Daughter of Eve, that's what I brought you here for. I'm to lead you where you shall meet him,”said Mr Beaver.

“Is—is he a man?”asked Lucy.

“Aslan a man!”said Mr Beaver sternly.“Certainly not. I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor-beyond-the-Sea.Don't you know who is the King of Beasts?Aslan is a lion—the Lion, the great Lion.”

“Ooh!”said Susan,“I'd thought he was a man. Is he—quite safe?I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.”

“That you will, dearie, and no mistake,”said Mrs Beaver;“if there's anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they're either braver than most or else just silly.”

“Then he isn't safe?”said Lucy.

“Safe?”said Mr Beaver;“don't you hear what Mrs Beaver tells you?Who said anything about safe?'Course he isn't safe. But he's good.He's the King, I tell you.”

“I'm longing to see him,”said Peter,“even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point.”

“That's right, Son of Adam,”said Mr Beaver, bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle.“And so you shall. Word has been sent that you are to meet him, tomorrow if you can, at the Stone Table.'

“Where's that?”said Lucy.

“I'll show you,”said Mr Beaver.“It's down the river, a good step from here. I'll take you to it!”

“But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus?”said Lucy.

“The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan,”said Mr Beaver.“Once he's with us, then we can begin doing things. Not thatwe don't need you too.For that's another of the old rhymes:

When Adam's fesh and Adam's bone

Sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

The evil time will be over and done.

So things must be drawing near their end now he's come and you've come. We've heard of Aslan coming into these parts before—long ago, nobody can say when.But there's never been any of your race here before.”

“That's what I don't understand, Mr Beaver,”said Peter.“I mean isn't the Witch herself human?”

“She'd like us to believe it,”said Mr Beaver,“and it's on that that she bases her claim to be Queen. But she's no Daughter of Eve.She comes of your father Adam's”—here Mr Beaver bowed—“your father Adam's frst wife, her they called Lilith.And she was one of the Jinn.That's what she comes from on one side.And on the other she comes of the giants.No, no, there isn't a drop of real human blood in the Witch.”

“That's why she's bad all through, Mr Beaver,”said Mrs Beaver.

“True enough, Mrs Beaver,”replied he,“there may be two views about humans（meaning no offence to the present company），but there's no two views about things that look like humans and aren't.”

“I've known good Dwarfs,”said Mrs Beaver.

“So've I, now you come to speak of it,”said her husband,“but precious few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that's going to be human and isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or ought to be human and isn't, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet.And that's why the Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in Narnia.She's beenwatching for you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she'd be more dangerous still.”

“What's that to do with it?”asked Peter.

“Because of another prophecy,”said Mr Beaver.“Down at Cair Paravel—that's the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be—down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it's a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch's reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn't be worth a shake of my whiskers!”

All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver was telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark, Lucy suddenly said:

“I say—where's Edmund?”

There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking,“Who saw him last?How long has he been missing?Is he outside?”and then all rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank.Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction.“Edmund!Edmund!”they called till they were hoarse.But the silently falling snow seemed to muffe their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.

“How perfectly dreadful!”said Susan as they at last came back in despair.“Oh, how I wish we'd never come.”

“What on earth are we to do, Mr Beaver?”said Peter.

“Do?”said Mr Beaver, who was already putting on his snow-boots.“Do?We must be off at once. We haven't a moment to spare!”

“We'd better divide into four search parties,”said Peter,“and all go in different directions. Whoever fnds him must come back here at once and—”

“Search parties, Son of Adam?”said Mr Beaver;“what for?”

“Why, to look for Edmund, of course!”

“There's no point in looking for him,”said Mr Beaver.

“What do you mean?”said Susan.“He can't be far away yet. And we've got to fnd him.What do you mean when you say there's no use looking for him?”

“The reason there's no use looking,”said Mr Beaver,“is that we know already where he's gone!”Everyone stared in amazement.“Don't you understand?”said Mr Beaver.“He's gone toher, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all.”

“Oh, surely—oh, really!”said Susan,“he can't have done that.”

“Can't he?”said Mr Beaver, looking very hard at the three children, and everything they wanted to say died on their lips, for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done.

“But will he know the way?”said Peter.

“Has he been in this country before?”asked Mr Beaver.“Has he ever been here alone?”

“Yes,”said Lucy, almost in a whisper.“I'm afraid he has.”

“And did he tell you what he'd done or who he'd met?”

“Well, no, he didn't,”said Lucy.

“Then mark my words,”said Mr Beaver,“he has already met the White Witch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn't like to mention it before（he being your brother and all）but the momentI set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself‘Treacherous'.He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food.You can always tell them if you've lived long in Narnia;something about their eyes.”

“All the same,”said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice,“we'll still have to go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast.And he's only a kid.”

“Go to the Witch's House?”said Mrs Beaver.“Don't you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?”

“How do you mean?”said Lucy.

“Why, all she wants is to get all four of you（she's thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel）. Once you were all four inside her House her job would be done—and there'd be four new statues in her collection before you'd had time to speak.But she'll keep him alive as long as he's the only one she's got, because she'll want to use him as a decoy;as bait to catch the rest of you with.”

“Oh, canno one help us?”wailed Lucy.

“Only Aslan,”said Mr Beaver.“We must go on and meet him. That's our only chance now.”

“It seems to me, my dears,”said Mrs Beaver,“that it is very important to know just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard.For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he left?If not, then we may do very well, for she won't know that Aslan has come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quite off her guard as far asthat is concerned.”

“I don't remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan—”began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.

“Oh yes, he was,”she said miserably;“don't you remember, it was he who asked whether the Witch couldn't turn Aslan into stone too?”

“So he did, by Jove,”said Peter;“just the sort of thing he would say, too!”

“Worse and worse,”said Mr Beaver,“and the next thing is this. Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?”

And of course no one knew the answer to this question.

“Because, if he was,”continued Mr Beaver,“then she'll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan.”

“But that isn't what she'll do frst,”said Mrs Beaver,“not if I know her. The moment that Edmund tells her that we're all here she'll set out to catch us this very night, and if he's been gone about half an hour, she'll be here in about another twenty minutes.”

“You're right, Mrs Beaver,”said her husband,“we must all get away from here. There's not a moment to lose.”





CHAPTER 9 IN THE WITCH'S HOUSE


AND now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He had eaten his share of the dinner, but he hadn't really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight—and there's nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad magic food.And he had heard the conversation, and hadn't enjoyed it much either, because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder.They weren't, but he imagined it.And then he had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table.It was then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door.For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling.

Just as Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme aboutAdam's fesh and Adam's bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the door-handle;and just before Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn't really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him.

You mustn't think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince（and later a King）and to payPeter back for calling him a beast.As for what the Witch would do with the others, he didn't want her to be particularly nice to them—certainly not to put them on the same level as himself;but he managed to believe, or to pretend he believed, that she wouldn't do anything very bad to them.“Because,”he said to himself,“all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it isn't true.She was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are.I expect she is the rightful Queen really.Anyway, she'll be better than that awful Aslan!”At least, that was the excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing.It wasn't a very good excuse, however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel.

The frst thing he realised, when he got outside and found the snow falling all round him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers'house. And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now.The next thing he realised was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly three o'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short.He hadn't reckoned on this;but he had to make the best of it.So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam（luckily it wasn't so slippery since the snow had fallen）to the far side of the river.

It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feet ahead.And then too there was no road.He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his shins against rocks, till he was wet and cold and bruised all over.The silence and the loneliness were dreadful.In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the others, if he hadn't happened to say to himself,“When I'm King of Narnia the frst thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads.”And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal.He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting the fnishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather changed.First the snow stopped.Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold.Finally, the clouds rolled away and the moon came out.It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made everything almost as bright as day—only the shadows were rather confusing.

He would never have found his way if the moon hadn't come out by the time he got to the other river—you remember he had seen（when they frst arrived at the Beavers'）a smaller river fowing into the great one lower down. He now reached this and turned to follow it up.But the little valley down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bushes, so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark.Even as it was, he got wet through for he had to stoop under branches, and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his back.And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter—just as if all this had been Peter's fault.

But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. And there, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle of a little plain between two hills, he saw what must be the White Witch's House.And the moon was shining brighter than ever.The House was really a small castle.It seemed to be all towers;little towers with long pointed spires on them, sharp as needles.They looked like huge dunce's caps or sorcerer's caps.And they shone in the moonlight and theirlong shadows looked strange on the snow.Edmund began to be afraid of the House.

But it was too late to think of turning back now. He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the House.There was nothing stirring;not the slightest sound anywhere.Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newly-fallen snow.He walked on and on, past corner after corner of the House, and past turret after turret to fnd the door.He had to go right round to the far side before he found it.It was a huge arch but the great iron gates stood wide open.

Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring.And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch, afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his knees knocking together.He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear.How long this really lasted I don't know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.

Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still—for it hadn't moved one inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could.He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been looking at him at all.（“But supposing it turns its head?”thought Edmund.）In fact it was staring at something else—namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about four feet away.“Aha!”thought Edmund.“When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape.”But still the lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone.Perhaps this was only a stone lion.And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that the lion's back and the top of its headwere covered with snow.Of course it must be only a statue!No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow.Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion.Even now he hardly dared touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did.It was cold stone.He had been frightened of a mere statue!

The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toes, and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea.“Probably,”he thought,“this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She's caught him already and turned him into stone.So that's the end of all their fne ideas about him!Pooh!Who's afraid of Aslan?”

And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did something very silly and childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion's upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes.Then he said,“Yah!Silly old Aslan!How do you like being a stone?You thought yourself mighty fne, didn't you?”But in spite of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the moonlight, that Edmund didn't really get any fun out of jeering at it.He turned away and began to cross the courtyard.

As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about—standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess-board when it is halfway through the game. There were stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat-a-mountains of stone.There were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees.There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon.They all looked so strange standing there perfectly life-like and also perfectly still, in thebright cold moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard.Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a ferce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand.Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like going past it.

He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard. He went to it;there was a fight of stone steps going up to an open door.Edmund went up them.Across the threshold lay a great wolf.

“It's all right, it's all right,”he kept saying to himself;“it's only a stone wolf. It can't hurt me”，and he raised his leg to step over it.Instantly the huge creature rose, with all the hair bristling along its back, opened a great, red mouth and said in a growling voice:

“Who's there?Who's there?Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are.”

“If you please, sir,”said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly speak,“my name is Edmund, and I'm the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day, and I've come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia—quite close, in the Beavers'house. She—she wanted to see them.”

“I will tell Her Majesty,”said the Wolf.“Meanwhile, stand still on the threshold, as you value your life.”Then it vanished into the house.

Edmund stood and waited, his fngers aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest, and presently the great wolf, Maugrim, the Chief of the Witch's Secret Police, came bounding back and said,“Come in!Come in!Fortunate favourite of the Queen—or else not so fortunate.”

And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf's paws.

He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, asthe courtyard had been, of statues. The one nearest the door was a little Faun with a very sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn't help wondering if this might be Lucy's friend.The only light came from a single lamp and close beside this sat the White Witch.

“I'm come, your Majesty,”said Edmund, rushing eagerly forward.

“How dare you come alone?”said the Witch in a terrible voice.“Did I not tell you to bring the others with you?”

“Please, your Majesty,”said Edmund,“I've done the best I can. I've brought them quite close.They're in the little house on top of the dam just up the river—with Mr and Mrs Beaver.”

A slow cruel smile came over the Witch's face.

“Is this all your news?”she asked.

“No, your Majesty,”said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the Beavers'house.

“What!Aslan?”cried the Queen,“Aslan!Is this true?If I fnd you have lied to me—”

“Please, I'm only repeating what they said,”stammered Edmund.

But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands. Instantly the same dwarf whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.

“Make ready our sledge,”ordered the Witch,“and use the harness without bells.”





CHAPTER 10 THE SPELL BEGINS TO BREAK


NOW we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other children. As soon as Mr Beaver said,“There's no time to lose,”everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs Beaver, who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said:“Now, Mr Beaver, just reach down that ham.And here's a packet of tea, and there's sugar, and some matches.And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner.”

“Whatare you doing, Mrs Beaver?”exclaimed Susan.

“Packing a load for each of us, dearie,”said Mrs Beaver very coolly.“You didn't think we'd set out on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?”

“But we haven't time!”said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat.“She may be here any minute.”

“That's what I say,”chimed in Mr Beaver.

“Get along with you all,”said his wife.“Think it over, Mr Beaver. She can't be here for quarter of an hour at least.”

“But don't we want as big a start as we can possibly get,”said Peter,“if we're to reach the Stone Table before her?”

“You've got to rememberthat, Mrs Beaver,”said Susan.“As soon as she has looked in here and fnds we're gone she'll be off at top speed.”

“That she will,”said Mrs Beaver.“But we can't get there before her whatever we do, for she'll be on a sledge and we'll be walking.”

“Then—have we no hope?”said Susan.

“Now don't you get fussing, there's a dear,”said Mrs Beaver,“but just get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of the drawer.'Course we've got a hope. We can't get therebefore her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she won't expect and perhaps we'll get through.”

“That's true enough, Mrs Beaver,”said her husband.“But it's time we were out of this.”

“And don'tyou start fussing either, Mr Beaver,”said his wife.“There. That's better.There's five loads and the smallest for the smallest of us:that's you, my dear,”she added, looking at Lucy.

“Oh, do please come on,”said Lucy.

“Well, I'm nearly ready now,”answered Mrs Beaver at last, allowing her husband to help her into her snow-boots.

“I suppose the sewing machine's took heavy to bring?”

“Yes. Itis,”said Mr Beaver.“A great deal too heavy.And you don't think you'll be able to use it while we're on the run, I suppose?”

“I can't abide the thought of that Witch fddling with it,”said Mrs Beaver,“and breaking it or stealing it, as likely as not.”

“Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!”said the three children. And so at last they all got outside and Mr Beaver locked the door（“It'll delay her a bit,”he said）and they set off, all carrying their loads over their shoulders.

The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. They went in single fle—frst Mr Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs Beaver last of all.Mr Beaver led them across the dam and on to the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river-bank.The sides of the valley, shining in the moonlight, towered up far above them on either side.“Best keep down here as much as possible,”he said.“She'll have to keepto the top, for you couldn't bring a sledge down here.”

It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair;and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they went on walking and walking—and walking—and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how she was going to keep up at all.And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop.Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more.And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the river-bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes.And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it.In fact, by the time she realised what was happening, only his short fat tail was showing.

Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heard noises of scrambling and puffng and panting behind her and in a moment all fve of them were inside.

“Wherever is this?”said Peter's voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness.（I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.）

“It's an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times,”said Mr Beaver,“and a great secret. It's not much of a place but we must get a few hours'sleep.”

“If you hadn't all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I'd have brought some pillows,”said Mrs Beaver.

It wasn't nearly such a nice cave as Mr Tumnus's, Lucy thought—just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of clothes together, and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug.If only the foor of the cave had been a little smoother!Then Mrs Beaver handed round in the dark a little fask out of which everyone drank something—it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat, but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you'd swallowed—and everyone went straight to sleep.

It seemed to Lucy only the next minute（though really it was hours and hours later）when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave.But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyone else.In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open listening to a sound which was the very sound they'd all been thinking of（and sometimes imagining they heard）during their walk last night.It was a sound of jingling bells.

Mr Beaver was out of the cave like a fash the moment he heard it. Perhaps you think, as Lucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing to do?But it was really a very sensible one.He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen;and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch's sledge went.The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering.They waited nearly fve minutes.Then they heard something that frightened them very much.They heard voices.“Oh,”thought Lucy,“he's been seen.She's caught him!”Great was their surprise when a little later, they heard Mr Beaver's voice calling to them from just outside the cave.

“It's all right,”he was shouting.“Come out, Mrs Beaver. Come out, Sons and Daughters of Adam.It's all right!It isn't Her!”This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited;I mean, in Narnia—in our world they usually don't talk at all.

So Mrs Beaver and the children came bundling out of the cave, all blinking in the daylight, and with earth all over them, and looking very frowsty and unbrushed and uncombed and with the sleep in their eyes.

“Come on!”cried Mr Beaver, who was almost dancing with delight.“Come and see!This is a nasty knock for the Witch!It looks as if her power is already crumbling.”

“Whatdo you mean, Mr Beaver?”panted Peter as they all scrambled up the steep bank of the valley together.

“Didn't I tell you,”answered Mr Beaver,“that she'd made it always winter and never Christmas?Didn't I tell you?Well, just come and see!”

And then they were all at the top and did see.

It was a sledge, and it was reindeer with bells on their harness. But they were far bigger than the Witch's reindeer, and they were not white but brown.And on the sledge sat a person whom everyone knew the moment they set eyes on him.He was a huge man in a bright red robe（bright as hollyberries）with a hood that had fur inside it and a great white beard that fell like a foamy waterfall over his chest.Everyone knew him because, though you see people of his sort only in Narnia, you see pictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world—the world on this side of the wardrobe door.But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different.Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly.But now that the children actually stood looking at him they didn't fnd it quite like that.He was so big, and so glad, and so real, that they all became quite still.They felt very glad, but also solemn.

“I've come at last,”said he.“She has kept me out for a long time, but I have got in at last. Aslan is on the move.The Witch's magic is weakening.”

And Lucy felt running through her that deep shiver of gladness which you only get if you are being solemn and still.

“And now,”said Father Christmas,“for your presents. There is a new and better sewing machine for you, Mrs Beaver.I will drop it in your house as I pass.”

“If you please, sir,”said Mrs Beaver, making a curtsey.“It's locked up.”

“Locks and bolts make no difference to me,”said Father Christmas.“And as for you, Mr Beaver, when you get home you will fnd your dam fnished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluice-gate ftted.”

Mr Beaver was so pleased that he opened his mouth very wide and then found he couldn't say anything at all.

“Peter, Adam's Son,”said Father Christmas.

“Here, sir,”said Peter.

“These are your presents,”was the answer,“and they are tools, not toys. The time to use them is perhaps near at hand.Bear them well.”With these words he handed to Peter a shield and a sword.The shield was the colour of silver and across it there ramped a red lion, as bright as a ripe strawberry at the moment when you pick it.The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use.Peter was silent and solemn as he received these gifts, for he felt they were a very serious kind of present.

“Susan, Eve's Daughter,”said Father Christmas.“These are for you,”and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn.“You must use the bow only in great need,”he said,“for I do not mean you to fght in the battle. It does not easily miss.And when you put this horn to your lips and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help ofsome kind will come to you.”

Last of all he said,“Lucy, Eve's Daughter,”and Lucy came forward. He gave her a little bottle of what looked like glass（but people said afterwards that it was made of diamond）and a small dagger.“In this bottle,”he said,“there is cordial made of the juice of one of the fire-flowers that grow in the mountains of the sun.If you or any of your friends is hurt, a few drops of this will restore them.And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need.For you also are not to be in the battle.”

“Why, sir?”said Lucy.“I think—I don't know—but I think I could be brave enough.”

“That is not the point,”he said.“But battles are ugly when women fight. And now”—here he suddenly looked less grave—“here is something for the moment for you all!”and he brought out（I suppose from the big bag at his back, but nobody quite saw him do it）a large tray containing fve cups and saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot.Then he cried out,“Merry Christmas!Long live the true King!”and cracked his whip, and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realised that they had started.

Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr Beaver, when Mrs Beaver said:

“Now then, now then!Don't stand talking there till the tea's got cold. Just like men.Come and help to carry the tray down and we'll have breakfast.What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread-knife.”

So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed themselves. But long before they had fnished enjoying themselves Mr Beaver said,“Time to be moving on now.”





CHAPTER 11 ASLAN IS NEARER


EDMUND meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When the dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him, as she had been at their last meeting.But she said nothing at all.And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say,“Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight?You—you—said—”she answered,“Silence, fool!”Then she appeared to change her mind and said, as if to herself,“And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way,”and once more clapped her hands.Another dwarf appeared.

“Bring the human creature food and drink,”she said.

The dwarf went away and presently returned bringing an iron bowl with some water in it and an iron plate with a hunk of dry bread on it. He grinned in a repulsive manner as he set them down on the floor beside Edmund and said:

“Turkish Delight for the little Prince. Ha!Ha!Ha!”

“Take it away,”said Edmund sulkily.“I don't want dry bread.”But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he apologized and began to nibble at the bread, though it was so stale he could hardly get it down.

“You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again,”said the Witch.

While he was still chewing away, the first dwarf came back andannounced that the sledge was ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmund to go with her.The snow was again falling as they came into the courtyard, but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge.But before they drove off she called Maugrim and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge.

“Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers,”said the Witch,“and kill whatever you fnd there. If they are already gone, then make all speed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen.Wait for me there in hiding.I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I fnd a place where I can drive across the river.You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table.You will know what to do if you fnd them!”

“I hear and obey, O Queen,”growled the Wolf, and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few minutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam sniffng at the Beavers'house.But of course they found it empty.It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fne, for the wolves would then have been able to follow their trail—and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave.But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the footprints were covered up.

Meanwhile the dwarf whipped up the reindeer, and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold. This was a terrible journey for Edmund, who had no coat.Before they had been going quarter of an hour all the front of him was covered with snow—he soon stopped trying to shake it off because, as quickly as he did that, a new lot gathered, and he was so tired.Soon he was wet to the skin.And oh, how miserable he was!It didn't look now as if the Witch intended to make him a King.All the things he had said to makehimself believe that she was good and kind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now.He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment—even Peter!The only way to comfort himself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he might wake up at any moment.And as they went on, hour after hour, it did come to seem like a dream.

This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it. But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight.And still they went on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer's harness.And then at last the Witch said,“What have we here?Stop!”and they did.

How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast!But she had stopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party, a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dogfox, all on stools round a table.Edmund couldn't quite see what they were eating, but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn't at all sure that he didn't see something like a plum pudding.At the moment when the sledge stopped, the Fox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just risen to its feet, holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say something.But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces.The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork halfway to his mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squeaked with terror.

“What is the meaning of this?”asked the Witch Queen. Nobody answered.

“Speak, vermin!”she said again.“Or do you want my dwarf to fnd you a tongue with his whip?What is the meaning of all this gluttony, thiswaste, this selfndulgence?Where did you get all these things?”

“Please, your Majesty,”said the Fox,“we were given them. And if I might make so bold as to drink your Majesty's very good health—”

“Who gave them to you?”said the Witch.

“F-F-F-Father Christmas,”stammered the Fox.

“What?”roared the Witch, springing from the sledge and taking a few strides nearer to the terrifed animals.“He has not been here!He cannot have been here!How dare you—but no. Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven.”

At that moment one of the young squirrels lost its head completely.

“He has—he has—he has!”it squeaked, beating its little spoon on the table.

Edmund saw the Witch bite her lips so that a drop of blood appeared on her white cheek. Then she raised her wand.

“Oh, don't, don't, please don't,”shouted Edmund, but even while he was shouting she had waved her wand and instantly where the merry party had been there were only statues of creatures（one with its stone fork fxed for ever halfway to its stone mouth）seated around a stone table on which there were stone plates and a stone plum pudding.

“As for you,”said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she re-mounted the sledge,“let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors. Drive on!”And Edmund, for the frst time in this story, felt sorry for someone besides himself.It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone fgures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grew on them and at last even their faces crumbled away.

Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all last night.At the same time he noticedthat he was feeling much less cold.It was also becoming foggy.In fact every minute it grew foggier and warmer.And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had been running up till now.At frst he thought this was because the reindeer were tired, but soon he saw that that couldn't be the real reason.The sledge jerked, and skidded and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones.And however the dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower.There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them, but the noise of their driving and jolting and the dwarf's shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was, until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn't go on at all.When that happened there was a moment's silence.And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly.A strange, sweet, rustling, chattering noise—and yet not so strange, for he'd heard it before—if only he could remember where!Then all at once he did remember.It was the noise of running water.All round them though out of sight, there were streams, chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even（in the distance）roaring.And his heart gave a great leap（though he hardly knew why）when he realised that the frost was over.And much nearer there was a drip-drip-drip from the branches of all the trees.And then, as he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the frst time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fr tree.But he hadn't time to listen or watch any longer, for the Witch said:

“Don't sit staring, fool!Get out and help.”

And of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow—but it was really only slush by now—and began helping the dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into.They got it out in the end, and by being very cruel to the reindeer the dwarf managed to get it on the move again, and they drove a little further.And now the snow was really melting in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appearin every direction.Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after the endless white.Then the sledge stopped again.

“It's no good, your Majesty,”said the dwarf.“We can't sledge in this thaw.”

“Then we must walk,”said the Witch.

“We shall never overtake them walking,”growled the dwarf.“Not with the start they've got.”

“Are you my councillor or my slave?”said the Witch.“Do as you're told. Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope.And take your whip.And cut the harness of the reindeer;they'll fnd their own way home.”

The dwarf obeyed, and in a few minutes Edmund found himself being forced to walk as fast as he could with his hands tied behind him. He kept on slipping in the slush and mud and wet grass, and every time he slipped, the dwarf gave him a curse and sometimes a fick with the whip.The Witch walked behind the dwarf and kept on saying,“Faster!Faster!”

Every moment the patches of green grew bigger and the patches of spow grew smaller. Every moment more and more of the trees shook off their robes of snow.Soon, wherever you looked, instead of white shapes you saw the dark green of frs or the black prickly branches of bare oaks and beeches and elms.Then the mist turned from white to gold and presently cleared away altogether.Shafts of delicious sunlight struck down on to the forest foor and overhead you could see a blue sky between the tree tops.

Soon there were more wonderful things happening. Coming suddenly round a corner into a glade of silver birch trees Edmund saw the ground covered in all directions with little yellow fowers—celandines.The noise of water grew louder.Presently they actually crossed a stream.Beyond itthey found snowdrops growing.

“Mind your own business!”said the dwarf when he saw that Edmund had turned his head to look at them;and he gave the rope a vicious jerk.

But of course this didn't prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree—gold and purple and white.Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water.Close beside the path they were following, a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree.It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off.And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, and within fve minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds'music, and wherever Edmund's eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasing one another or having their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with their beaks.

“Faster!Faster!”said the Witch.

There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time.In the wide glades there were primroses.A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces of the travellers.The trees began to come fully alive.The larches and birches were covered with green, the laburnums with gold.Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves.As the travellers walked under them the light also became green.A bee buzzed across their path.

“This is no thaw,”said the dwarf, suddenly stopping.“This isSpring. What are we to do?Your winter has been destroyed, I tell you!This is Aslan's doing.”

“If either of you mention that name again,”said the Witch,“he shall instantly be killed.”





CHAPTER 12 PETER'S FIRST BATTLE


WHILE the dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beavers and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats behind them.And by now they had even stopped saying to one another,“Look!there's a kingfsher,”or“I say, bluebells!”or,“What was that lovely smell?”or,“Just listen to that thrush!”They walked on in silence drinking it all in, passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense masses of fowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost overpowering.

They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May. They hadn't even known for certain（as the Witch did）that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia.But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter;and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch's schemes.And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realised that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge.After that they didn't hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer ones.They were pretty tired by now of course;but not what I'd call bitterly tired—only slow andfeeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open.Susan had a slight blister on one heel.

They had left the course of the big river some time ago;for one had to turn a little to the right（that meant a little to the south）to reach the place of the Stone Table. Even if this had not been their way they couldn't have kept to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood—a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow food—and their path would have been under water.

And now the sun got low and the light got redder and the shadows got longer and the fowers began to think about closing.

“Not long now,”said Mr Beaver, and began leading them uphill across some very deep, springy moss（it felt nice under their tired feet）in a place where only tall trees grew, very wide apart. The climb, coming at the end of the long day, made them all pant and blow.And just as Lucy was wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly theywere at the top.And this is what they saw.

They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction—except right ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving.“By gum!”whispered Peter to Susan.“The sea!”In the very middle of this open hill-top was the Stone Table.It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stones.It looked very old;and it was cut all over with strange lines and fgures that might be the letters of an unknown language.They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them.The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place.A wonderful pavilion it was—and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it—with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent-pegs of ivory;and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a red rampant lion futtering in the breeze whichwas blowing in their faces from the far-off sea.While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right;and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see.

Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves round him in the shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Women there and Well-Women（Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in our world）who had stringed instruments;it was they who had made the music.There were four great centaurs.The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants.There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and a great Dog.And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard.

But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn't know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time.If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now.For when they tried to look at Aslan's face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes;and then they found they couldn't look at him and went all trembly.

“Go on,”whispered Mr Beaver.

“No,”whispered Peter,“you frst.”

“No, Sons of Adam before animals,”whispered Mr Beaver back again.

“Susan,”whispered Peter.“What about you?Ladies frst.”

“No, you're the eldest,”whispered Susan. And of course the longer they went on doing this the more awkward they felt.Then at last Peter realised that it was up to him.He drew his sword and raised it to the salute and, hastily saying to the others,“Come on.Pull yourselves together,”headvanced to the Lion and said:

“We have come—Aslan.”

“Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam,”said Aslan.“Welcome, Susan and Lucy, Daughters of Eve. Welcome He-Beaver and She-Beaver.”

His voice was deep and rich and somehow took the fidgets out of them. They now felt glad and quiet and it didn't seem awkward to them to stand and say nothing.

“But where is the fourth?”asked Aslan.

“He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch, O Aslan,”said Mr Beaver.

And then something made Peter say,“That was partly my fault, Aslan. I was angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong.”

And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great unchanging eyes. And it seemed to all of them that there was nothing to be said.

“Please—Aslan,”said Lucy,“can anything be done to save Edmund?”

“All shall be done,”said Aslan.“But it may be harder than you think.”And then he was silent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked;now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad as well.But in the next minute that expression was quite gone.The Lion shook his mane and clapped his paws together（“Terrible paws,”thought Lucy,“if he didn't know how to velvet them!”）and said,

“Meanwhile, let the feast be prepared. Ladies, take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them.”

When the girls had gone Aslan laid his paw—and though it was velveted it was very heavy—on Peter's shoulder and said,“Come, Son of Adam, and I will show you a far-off sight of the castle where you are to beKing.”

And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hilltop. There a beautiful sight met their eyes.The sun was setting behind their backs.That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light—forest and hills and valleys and, winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river.And beyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds which were just turning rose colour with the refection of the sunset.But just where the land of Narnia met the sea—in fact, at the mouth of the great river—there was something on a little hill, shining.It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight was refected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset;but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore.

“That, O Man,”said Aslan,“is Cair Paravel of the four thrones, in one of which you must sit as King. I show it to you because you are the frst-born and you will be High King over all the rest.”

And once more Peter said nothing, for at that moment a strange noise woke the silence suddenly. It was like a bugle, but richer.

“It is your sister's horn,”said Aslan to Peter in a low voice;so low as to be almost a purr, if it is not disrespectful to think of a Lion purring.

For a moment Peter did not understand. Then, when he saw all the other creatures start forward and heard Aslan say with a wave of his paw,“Back!Let the Prince win his spurs,”he did understand, and set off running as hard as he could to the pavilion.And there he saw a dreadful sight.

The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was running towards him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as white as paper.Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree, and swing herself up, followed by a huge grey beast.At frst Peter thought itwas a bear.Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big to be a dog.Then he realised that it was a wolf—a wolf standing on its hind legs, with its front paws against the tree-trunk, snapping and snarling.All the hair on its back stood up on end.Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch.One of her legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snapping teeth.Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip;then he realised that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off.

Peter did not feel very brave;indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But that made no difference to what he had to do.He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side.That stroke never reached the Wolf.Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and its mouth wide open in a howl of anger.If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once.As it was—though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all—he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword, as hard as he could, between the brute's forelegs into its heart.Then came a horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare.He was tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knocked against his forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair.A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and was straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes.He felt tired all over.

Then, after a bit, Susan came down the tree. She and Peter felt pretty shaky when they met and I won't say there wasn't kissing and crying on both sides.But in Narnia no one thinks any the worse of you for that.

“Quick!Quick!”shouted the voice of Aslan.“Centaurs!Eagles!I see another wolf in the thickets. There—behind you.He has just dartedaway.After him, all of you.He will be going to his mistress.Now is your chance to fnd the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam.”And instantly with a thunder of hoofs and beating of wings a dozen or so of the swiftest creatures disappeared into the gathering darkness.

Peter, still out of breath, turned and saw Aslan close at hand.

“You have forgotten to clean your sword,”said Aslan.

It was true. Peter blushed when he looked at the bright blade and saw it all smeared with the Wolf's hair and blood.He stooped down and wiped it quite clean on the grass, and then wiped it quite dry on his coat.

“Hand it to me and kneel, Son of Adam,”said Aslan. And when Peter had done so he struck him with the fat of the blade and said,“Rise up, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane.And, whatever happens, never forget to wipe your sword.”





CHAPTER 13 DEEP MAGIC FROM THE DAWN OF TIME


Now we must get back to Edmund. When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fr trees and yew trees.Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let him lie still.He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was.The Witch and the dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.

“No,”said the dwarf,“it is no use now, O Queen. They must have reached the Stone Table by now.”

“Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news,”said the Witch.

“It cannot be good news if he does,”said the dwarf.

“Four thrones in Cair Paravel,”said the Witch.“How if only three were flled?That would not fulfl the prophecy.”

“What difference would that make now that He is here?”said the dwarf. He did not dare, even now, to mention the name of Aslan to his mistress.

“He may not stay long. And then—we would fall upon the three at Cair.”

“Yet it might be better,”said the dwarf,“to keep this one”（here hekicked Edmund）“for bargaining with.”

“Yes!And have him rescued,”said the Witch scornfully.

“Then,”said the dwarf,“we had better do what we have to do at once.”

“I would like to have it done on the Stone Table itself,”said the Witch.“That is the proper place. That is where it has always been done before.”

“It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use,”said the dwarf.

“True,”said the Witch;and then,“Well, I will begin.”

At that moment with a rush and a snarl a Wolf rushed up to them.

“I have seen them. They are all at the Stone Table, with Him.They have killed my captain, Maugrim.I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all.One of the Sons of Adam killed him.Fly!Fly!”

“No,”said the Witch.“There need be no fying. Go quickly.Summon all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can.Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side.Call the Ghouls, and the Boggles, the Ogres and the Minotaurs.Call the Cruels, the Hags, the Spectres, and the people of the Toadstools.We will fght.What?Have I not still my wand?Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on?Be off quickly, I have a little thing to fnish here while you are away.”

The great brute bowed its head, turned, and galloped away.

“Now!”she said,“We have no table—let me see. We had better put it against the trunk of a tree.”

Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast.He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle.Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly white.Because they were so very white he could see them, but he could not see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.

“Prepare the victim,”said the Witch. And the Dwarf undid Edmund's collar and folded back his shirt at the neck.Then he took Edmund's hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin.After that Edmund heard a strange noise—whizz—whizz—whizz.For a moment he couldn't think what it was.Then he realised.It was the sound of a knife being sharpened.

At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction—a drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings—a scream from the Witch—confusion all round him. And then he found he was being untied.Strong arms were round him and he heard big, kind voices saying things like—

“Let him lie down—give him some wine—drink this—steady now—you'll be all right in a minute.”

Then he heard the voices of people who were not talking to him but to one another. And they were saying things like,“Who's got the Witch?”—“I thought you had her.”“I didn't see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand—I was after the dwarf—do you mean to say she's escaped?”“A chap can't mind everything at once—what's that?Oh, sorry, it's only an old stump!”But just at this point Edmund went off in a dead faint.

Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds（they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter）all set off to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them. But if they could have seen what happened in that valley after they had gone, I think they might have been surprised.

It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright;if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump and on a fair-sized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the stump and the boulder.And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground.And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump;for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the dwarf.For it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they aren't, and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife was knocked out of her hand.She had kept hold of her wand, so it had been kept safe, too.

When the other children woke up next morning（they had been sleeping on piles of cushions in the pavilion）the frst thing they heard—from Mrs Beaver—was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night;and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had breakfasted they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass, apart from the rest of the court.There is no need to tell you（and no one ever heard）what Aslan was saying, but it was a conversation which Edmund never forgot.As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them, bringing Edmund with him.

“Here is your brother,”he said,“and—there is no need to talk to him about what is past.”

Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in turn,“I'm sorry,”and everyone said,“That's all right.”And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friends with him again—something ordinary and natural—and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said,

“Sire, there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience.”

“Let him approach,”said Aslan.

The leopard went away and soon returned leading the Witch's dwarf.

“What is your message, Son of Earth?”asked Aslan.

“The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak with you,”said the dwarf,“on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers.”

“Queen of Narnia, indeed!”said Mr Beaver.“Of all the cheek—”

“Peace, Beaver,”said Aslan.“All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about them.Tell your mistress, Son of Earth, that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wand behind her at that great oak.”

This was agreed to and two leopards went back with the dwarf to see that the conditions were properly carried out.“But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone?”whispered Lucy to Peter. I think the same idea had occurred to the leopards themselves;at any rate, as they walked off their fur was all standing up on their backs and their tails were bristling—like a cat's when it sees a strange dog.

“It'll be all right,”whispered Peter in reply.“He wouldn't send them if it weren't.”

A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children who had not seen her before felt shudders running down their backs at the sight of her face;and there were low growls among all the animals present.Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold.The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself.It was the oddest thing to see those two faces—the golden face and the dead—white face—so close together.Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes;Mrs Beaverparticularly noticed this.

“You have a traitor there, Aslan,”said the Witch. Of course everyone present knew that she meant Edmund.But Edmund had got past thinking about himself after all he'd been through and after the talk he'd had that morning.He just went on looking at Aslan.It didn't seem to matter what the Witch said.

“Well,”said Aslan.“His offence was not against you.”

“Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?”asked the Witch.

“Let us say I have forgotten it,”answered Aslan gravely.“Tell us of this Deep Magic.”

“Tell you?”said the Witch, her voice growing suddenly shriller.“Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us?Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the firestones on the Secret Hill?Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea?You at least know the Magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning. You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill.”

“Oh,”said Mr Beaver.“Sothat's how you came to imagine yourself a queen—because you were the Emperor's hangman. I see.”

“Peace, Beaver,”said Aslan, with a very low growl.

“And so,”continued the Witch,“that human creature is mine. His life is forfeit to me.His blood is my property.”

“Come and take it then,”said the Bull with the man's head, in a great bellowing voice.

“Fool,”said the Witch with a savage smile that was almost a snarl,“do you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force?He knows the Deep Magic better than that. He knows that unless I have blood as the Law says, all Narnia will be overturned and perish in freand water.”

“It is very true,”said Aslan,“I do not deny it.”

“Oh, Aslan!”whispered Susan in the Lion's ear.“Can't we—I mean, you won't, will you?Can't we do something about the Deep Magic?Isn't there something you can work against it?”

“Work against the Emperor's Magic?”said Aslan, turning to her with something like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again.

Edmund was on the other side of Aslan, looking all the time at Aslan's face. He felt a choking feeling and wondered if he ought to say something;but a moment later he felt that he was not expected to do anything except to wait, and do what he was told.

“Fall back, all of you,”said Aslan,“and I will talk to the Witch alone.”

They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this—waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices.Lucy said,“Oh, Edmund!”and began to cry.Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea.The Beavers stood holding each other's paws with their heads bowed.The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs.But everyone became perfectly still in the end, so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumble-bee fying past, or the birds in the forest down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves.And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on.

At last they heard Aslan's voice,“You can all come back,”he said.“I have settled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother's blood.”And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been holding their breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur of talk.

The Witch was just turning away with a look of ferce joy on her facewhen she stopped and said,

“But how do I know this promise will be kept?”

“Haa-a-arrh!”roared Aslan, half rising from his throne;and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her skirts and fairly ran for her life.





CHAPTER 14 THE TRIUMPH OF THE WITCH


As soon as the Witch had gone Aslan said,“We must move from this place at once, it will be wanted for other purposes. We shall encamp tonight at the Fords of Beruna.

Of course everyone was dying to ask him how he had arranged matters with the Witch;but his face was stern and everyone's ears were still ringing with the sound of his roar and so nobody dared.

After a meal, which was taken in the open air on the hill-top（for the sun had got strong by now and dried the grass），they were busy for a while taking the pavilion down and packing things up. Before two o'clock they were on the march and set off in a north-easterly direction, walking at an easy pace, for they had not far to go.

During the frst part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign.“As soon as she has fnished her business in these parts,”he said,“the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it.”He then went on to outline two plans of battle—one for fghting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle.And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the operations, saying things like,“You must put your Centaurs in such and such a place”or“You must post scouts to see that she doesn't do so-and-so,”till at last Peter said,

“But you will be there yourself, Aslan.”

“I can give you no promise of that,”answered the Lion. And he continued giving Peter his instructions.

For the last part of the journey it was Susan and Lucy who saw most of him. He did not talk very much and seemed to them to be sad.

It was still afternoon when they came down to a place where the river valley had widened out and the river was broad and shallow. This was the Fords of Beruna and Aslan gave orders to halt on this side of the water.But Peter said,

“Wouldn't it be better to camp on the far side—for fear she should try a night attack or anything?”

Aslan, who seemed to have been thinking about something else, roused himself with a shake of his magnificent mane and said,“Eh?What's that?”Peter said it all over again.

“No,”said Aslan in a dull voice, as if it didn't matter.“No. She will not make an attack tonight.”And then he sighed deeply.But presently he added,“All the same it was well thought of.That is how a soldier ought to think.But it doesn't really matter.”So they proceeded to pitch their camp.

Aslan's mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fghting the battle on his own;the news that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him.Supper that evening was a quiet meal.Everyone felt how different it had been the previous night or even that morning.It was as if the good times, having just begun, were already drawing to their end.

This feeling affected Susan so much that she couldn't get to sleep when she went to bed. And after she had lain counting sheep and turning over and over she heard Lucy give a long sigh and turn over just beside her in the darkness.

“Can't you get to sleep either?”said Susan.

“No,”said Lucy.“I thought you were asleep. I say, Susan!”

“What?”

“I've a most horrible feeling—as if something were hanging over us.”

“Have you?Because, as a matter of fact, so have I.”

“Something about Aslan,”said Lucy.“Either some dreadful thing is going to happen to him, or something dreadful that he's going to do.”

“There's been something wrong with him all afternoon,”said Susan.“Lucy!What was that he said about not being with us at the battle?You don't think he could be stealing away and leaving us tonight, do you?”

“Where is he now?”said Lucy.“Is he here in the pavilion?”

“I don't think so.”

“Susan!let's go outside and have a look round. We might see him.”

“All right. Let's,”said Susan;“we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here.”

Very quietly the two girls groped their way among the other sleepers and crept out of the tent. The moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones.Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy's arm and said,“Look!”On the far side of the camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood.Without a word they both followed him.

He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the right—apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet with the heavy dew.He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew.His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were very, very tired.Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where there where no shadows for them to hide in, he stopped and lookedround.It was no good trying to run away so they came towards him.When they were closer he said,

“Oh, children, children, why are you following me?”

“We couldn't sleep,”said Lucy—and then felt sure that she need say no more and that Aslan knew all they had been thinking.

“Please, may we come with you—wherever you're going?”asked Susan.

“Well—”said Aslan, and seemed to be thinking. Then he said,“I should be glad of company tonight.Yes, you may come, if you will promise to stop when I tell you, and after that leave me to go on alone.”

“Oh, thank you, thank you. And we will,”said the two girls.

Forward they went again and one of the girls walked on each side of the Lion. But how slowly he walked!And his great, royal head drooped so that his nose nearly touched the grass.Presently he stumbled and gave a low moan.

“Aslan!Dear Aslan!”said Lucy,“what is wrong?Can't you tell us?”

“Are you ill, dear Aslan?”asked Susan.

“No,”said Aslan.“I am sad and lonely. Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that.”

And so the girls did what they would never have dared to do without his permission, but what they had longed to do ever since they frst saw him—buried their cold hands in the beautiful sea of fur and stroked it and, so doing, walked with him. And presently they saw that they were going with him up the slope of the hill on which the Stone Table stood.They went up at the side where the trees came furthest up, and when they got to the last tree（it was one that had some bushes about it）Aslan stopped and said,

“Oh, children, children. Here you must stop.And whatever happens, do not let yourselves be seen.Farewell.”

And both the girls cried bitterly（though they hardly knew why）and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great, sad eyes. Then he turned from them and walked out on to the top of the hill.And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him, and this is what they saw.

A great crowd of people were standing all round the Stone Table and though the moon was shining many of them carried torches which burned with evil-looking red flames and black smoke. But such people!Ogres with monstrous teeth, and wolves, and bull-headed men;spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants;and other creatures whom I won't describe because if I did the grown-ups would probably not let you read this book—Cruels and Hags and Incubuses, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Sprites, Orknies, Wooses, and Ettins.In fact here were all those who were on the Witch's side and whom the Wolf had summoned at her command.And right in the middle, standing by the Table, was the Witch herself.

A howl and a gibber of dismay went up from the creatures when they frst saw the great Lion pacing towards them, and for a moment even the Witch seemed to be struck with fear. Then she recovered herself and gave a wild ferce laugh.

“The fool!”she cried.“The fool has come. Bind him fast.”

Lucy and Susan held their breaths waiting for Aslan's roar and his spring upon his enemies. But it never came.Four Hags, grinning and leering, yet also（at frst）hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do, had approached him.“Bind him, I say!”repeated the White Witch.The Hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all.Then others—evil dwarfs and apes—rushed in to help them, and between them they rolled the huge Lion over on his back and tied all his four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one ofthose paws could have been the death of them all.But he made no noise, even when the enemies, straining and tugging, pulled the cords so tight that they cut into his fesh.Then they began to drag him towards the Stone Table.

“Stop!”said the Witch.“Let him frst be shaved.”

Another roar of mean laughter went up from her followers as an ogre with a pair of shears came forward and squatted down by Aslan's head. Snip-snip-snip went the shears and masses of curling gold began to fall to the ground.Then the ogre stood back and the children, watching from their hiding-place, could see the face of Aslan looking all small and different without its mane.The enemies also saw the difference.

“Why, he's only a great cat after all!”cried one.

“Isthat what we were afraid of?”said another.

And they surged round Aslan, jeering at him, saying things like,“Puss, Puss!Poor Pussy,”and,“How many mice have you caught today, Cat?”and,“Would you like a saucer of milk, Pussums?”

“Oh, how can they?”said Lucy, tears streaming down her cheeks.“The brutes, the brutes!”For now that the frst shock was over, the shorn face of Aslan looked to her braver, and more beautiful, and more patient than ever.

“Muzzle him!”said the Witch. And even now, as they worked about his face putting on the muzzle, one bite from his jaws would have cost two or three of them their hands.But he never moved.And this seemed to enrage all that rabble.Everyone was at him now.Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage, and for a few minutes the two girls could not even see him—so thickly was he surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him, spitting on him, jeering at him.

At last the rabble had had enough of this. They began to drag thebound and muzzled Lion to the Stone Table, some pulling and some pushing.He was so huge that even when they got him there it took all their efforts to hoist him on to the surface of it.Then there was more tying and tightening of cords.

“The cowards!The cowards!”sobbed Susan.“Are theystill afraid of him, even now?”

When once Aslan had been tied（and tied so that he was really a mass of cords）on the fat stone, a hush fell on the crowd. Four Hags, holding four torches, stood at the corners of the Table.The Witch bared her arms as she had bared them the previous night when it had been Edmund instead of Aslan.Then she began to whet her knife.It looked to the children, when the gleam of the torchlight fell on it, as if the knife were made of stone, not of steel, and it was of a strange and evil shape.

As last she drew near. She stood by Aslan's head.Her face was working and twitching with passion, but his looked up at the sky, still quiet, neither angry nor afraid, but a little sad.Then, just before she gave the blow, she stooped down and said in a quivering voice,

“And now, who has won?Fool, did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor?Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased. But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well?And who will take him out of my handthen?Understand that you have given me Narnia for ever, you have lost your own life and you have not saved his.In that knowledge, despair and die.”

The children did not see the actual moment of the killing. They couldn't bear to look and had covered their eyes.





CHAPTER 15 DEEPERMAGICFROMBEFORETHEDAWNOFTIME


WHILE the two girls still crouched in the bushes with their hands over their faces, they heard the voice of the Witch calling out,

“Now!Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war!It will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool, the great Cat, lies dead.”

At this moment the children were for a few seconds in very great danger. For with wild cries and a noise of skirling pipes and shrill horns blowing, the whole of that vile rabble came sweeping off the hill-top and down the slope right past their hiding-place.They felt the Spectres go by them like a cold wind and they felt the ground shake beneath them under the galloping feet of the Minotaurs;and overhead there went a furry of foul wings and a blackness of vultures and giant bats.At any other time they would have trembled with fear;but now the sadness and shame and horror of Aslan's death so flled their minds that they hardly thought of it.

As soon as the wood was silent again Susan and Lucy crept out onto the open hill-top. The moon was getting low and thin clouds were passing across her, but still they could see the shape of the Lion lying dead in his bonds.And down they both knelt in the wet grass and kissed his cold face and stroked his beautiful fur—what was left of it—and cried till they could cry no more.And then they looked at each other and held each other's hands for mere loneliness and cried again;and then again weresilent.At last Lucy said,

“I can't bear to look at that horrible muzzle. I wonder, could we take if off?”

So they tried. And after a lot of working at it（for their fngers were cold and it was now the darkest part of the night）they succeeded.And when they saw his face without it they burst out crying again and kissed it and fondled it and wiped away the blood and the foam as well as they could.And it was all more lonely and hopeless and horrid than I know how to describe.

“I wonder, could we untie him as well?”said Susan presently. But the enemies, out of pure spitefulness, had drawn the cords so tight that the girls could make nothing of the knots.

I hope no one who reads this book has been quite as miserable as Susan and Lucy were that night;but if you have been—if you've been up all night and cried till you have no more tears left in you—you will know that there comes in the end a sort of quietness. You feel as if nothing is ever going to happen again.At any rate that was how it felt to these two.Hours and hours seemed to go by in this dead calm, and they hardly noticed that they were getting colder and colder.But at last Lucy noticed two other things.One was that the sky on the east side of the hill was a little less dark than it had been an hour ago.The other was some tiny movement going on in the grass at her feet.At frst she took no interest in this.What did it matter?Nothing mattered now!But at last she saw that whatever-it-was had begun to move up the upright stones of the Stone Table.And now whatever-they-were were moving about on Aslan's body.She peered closer.They were little grey things.

“Ugh!”said Susan from the other side of the Table.“How beastly!There are horrid little mice crawling over him. Go away, you little beasts.”And she raised her hand to frighten them away.

“Wait!”said Lucy, who had been looking at them more closely still.“Can you see what they're doing?”

Both girls bent down and stared.

“I do believe—”said Susan.“But how queer!They're nibbling away at the cords!”

“That's what I thought,”said Lucy.“I think they're friendly mice. Poor little things—they don't realise he's dead.They think it'll do some good untying him.”

It was quite defnitely lighter by now. Each of the girls noticed for the frst time the white face of the other.They could see the mice nibbling away;dozens and dozens, even hundreds, of little feld mice.And at last, one by one, the ropes were all gnawed through.

The sky in the east was whitish by now and the stars were getting fainter—all except one very big one low down on the eastern horizon. They felt colder than they had been all night.The mice crept away again.

The girls cleared away the remains of the gnawed ropes. Aslan looked more like himself without them.Every moment his dead face looked nobler, as the light grew and they could see it better.

In the wood behind them a bird gave a chuckling sound. It had been so still for hours and hours that it startled them.Then another bird answered it.Soon there were birds singing all over the place.

It was quite defnitely early morning now, not late night.

“I'm so cold,”said Lucy.

“So am I,”said Susan.“Let's walk about a bit.”

They walked to the eastern edge of the hill and looked down. The one big star had almost disappeared.The country all looked dark grey, but beyond, at the very end of the world, the sea showed pale.The sky began to turn red.They walked to and fro more times than they could count between the dead Aslan and the eastern ridge, trying to keep warm;and oh, how tired their legs felt.Then at last, as they stood for a moment looking out towards the sea and Cair Paravel（which they could now just make out）the red turned to gold along the line where the sea and the sky met and very slowly up came the edge of the sun.At that moment they heard from behind them a loud noise—a great cracking, deafening noise as if a giant had broken a giant's plate.

“What's that?”said Lucy, clutching Susan's arm.

“I—I feel afraid to turn round,”said Susan;“something awful is happening.”

“They're doing something worse to Him,”said Lucy.“Come on!”And she turned, pulling Susan round with her.

The rising of the sun had made everything look so different—all colours and shadows were changed—that for a moment they didn't see the important thing. Then they did.The Stone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end;and there was no Aslan.

“Oh, oh, oh!”cried the two girls, rushing back to the Table.

“Oh, it's too bad,”sobbed Lucy;“they might have left the body alone.”

“Who's done it?”cried Susan.“What does it mean?Is it magic?”

“Yes!”said a great voice behind their backs.“It is more magic.”They looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane（for it had apparently grown again）stood Aslan himself.

“Oh, Aslan!”cried both the children, staring up at him, almost as much frightened as they were glad.

“Aren't you dead then, dear Aslan?”said Lucy.

“Not now,”said Aslan.

“You're not—not a—?”asked Susan in a shaky voice. She couldn'tbring herself to say the word ghost.Aslan stooped his golden head and licked her forehead.The warmth of his breath and a rich sort of smell that seemed to hang about his hair came all over her.

“Do I look it?”he said.

“Oh, you're real, you're real!Oh, Aslan!”cried Lucy, and both girls fung themselves upon him and covered him with kisses.

“But what does it all mean?”asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer.

“It means,”said Aslan,“that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time.But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation.She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards.And now—”

“Oh yes. Now?”said Lucy, jumping up and clapping her hands.

“Oh, children,”said the Lion,“I feel my strength coming back to me. Oh, children, catch me if you can!”He stood for a second, his eyes very bright, his limbs quivering, lashing himself with his tail.Then he made a leap high over their heads and landed on the other side of the Table.Laughing, though she didn't know why, Lucy scrambled over it to reach him.Aslan leaped again.A mad chase began.Round and round the hill-top he led them, now hopelessly out of their reach, now letting them almost catch his tail, now diving between them, now tossing them in the air with his huge and beautifully velveted paws and catching them again, and now stopping unexpectedly so that all three of them rolled over together in a happy laughing heap of fur and arms and legs.It was such a romp as no one has ever had except in Narnia;and whether it was more like playingwith a thunderstorm or playing with a kitten Lucy could never make up her mind.And the funny thing was that when all three fnally lay together panting in the sun, the girls no longer felt in the least tired or hungry or thirsty.

“And now,”said Aslan presently,“to business. I feel I am going to roar.You had better put your fngers in your ears.”

And they did. And Aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it.And they saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in a meadow before the wind.Then he said,

“We have a long journey to go. You must ride on me.”And he crouched down and the children climbed on to his warm, golden back, and Susan sat frst, holding on tightly to his mane and Lucy sat behind holding on tightly to Susan.And with a great heave he rose underneath them and then shot off, faster than any horse could go, downhill and into the thick of the forest.

That ride was perhaps the most wonderful thing that happened to them in Narnia. Have you ever had a gallop on a horse?Think of that;and then take away the heavy noise of the hoofs and the jingle of the bit and imagine instead the almost noiseless padding of the great paws.Then imagine instead of the black or grey or chestnut back of the horse the soft roughness of golden fur, and the mane fying back in the wind.And then imagine you are going about twice as fast as the fastest racehorse.But this is a mount that doesn't need to be guided and never grows tired.He rushes on and on, never missing his footing, never hesitating, threading his way with perfect skill between tree trunks, jumping over bush and briar and the smaller streams, wading the larger, swimming the largest of all.And you are riding not on a road nor in a park nor even on the downs, but right across Narnia, in spring, down solemn avenues of beech and across sunnyglades of oak, through wild orchards of snow-white cherry trees, past roaring waterfalls and mossy rocks and echoing caverns, up windy slopes alight with gorse bushes, and across the shoulders of heathery mountains and along giddy ridges and down, down, down again into wild valleys and out into acres of blue fowers.

It was nearly midday when they found themselves looking down a steep hillside at a castle—a little toy castle it looked from where they stood—which seemed to be all pointed towers. But the Lion was rushing down at such a speed that it grew larger every moment and before they had time even to ask themselves what it was they were already on a level with it.And now it no longer looked like a toy castle but rose frowning in front of them.No face looked over the battlements and the gates were fast shut.And Aslan, not at all slacking his pace, rushed straight as a bullet towards it.

“The Witch's home!”he cried.“Now, children, hold tight.”

Next moment the whole world seemed to turn upside down, and the children felt as if they had left their insides behind them;for the Lion had gathered himself together for a greater leap than any he had yet made and jumped—or you may call it flying rather than jumping—right over the castle wall. The two girls, breathless but unhurt, found themselves tumbling off his back in the middle of a wide stone courtyard full of statues.





CHAPTER 16 WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT THE STATUES


“WHAT an extraordinary place!”cried Lucy.“All those stone animals—and people too!It's—like a museum.”

“Hush,”said Susan,“Aslan's doing something.”

He was indeed. He had bounded up to the stone lion and breathed on him.Then without waiting a moment he whisked round—almost as if he had been a cat chasing its tail—and breathed also on the stone dwarf, which（as you remember）was standing a few feet from the lion with his back to it.Then he pounced on a tall stone dryad which stood beyond the dwarf, turned rapidly aside to deal with a stone rabbit on his right, and rushed on to two centaurs.But at that moment Lucy said,

“Oh, Susan!Look!Look at the lion.”

I expect you've seen someone put a lighted match to a bit of newspaper which is propped up in a grate against an unlit fre. And for a second nothing seems to have happened;and then you notice a tiny streak of fame creeping along the edge of the newspaper.It was like that now.For a second after Aslan had breathed upon him the stone lion looked just the same.Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back—then it spread—then the colour seemed to lick all over him as the fame licks all over a bit of paper—then, while his hindquarters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds rippled into living hair.Then he opened a great red mouth, warm andliving, and gave a prodigious yawn.And now his hind legs had come to life.He lifted one of them and scratched himself.Then, having caught sight of Aslan, he went bounding after him and frisking round him, whimpering with delight and jumping up to lick his face.

Of course the children's eyes turned to follow the lion;but the sight they saw was so wonderful that they soon forgot about him. Everywhere the statues were coming to life.The courtyard looked no longer like a museum;it looked more like a zoo.Creatures were running after Aslan and dancing round him till he was almost hidden in the crowd.Instead of all that deadly white the courtyard was now a blaze of colours;glossy chestnut sides of centaurs, indigo horns of unicorns, dazzling plumage of birds, reddy-brown of foxes, dogs and satyrs, yellow stockings and crimson hoods of dwarfs;and the birch-girls in silver, and the beech-girls in fresh, transparent green, and the larch-girls in green so bright that it was almost yellow.And instead of the deadly silence the whole place rang with the sound of happy roarings, brayings, yelpings, barkings, squealings, cooings, neighings, stampings, shouts, hurrahs, songs and laughter.

“Oh!”said Susan in a different tone.“Look!I wonder—I mean, is it safe?”

Lucy looked and saw that Aslan had just breathed on the feet of the stone giant.

“It's all right!”shouted Aslan joyously.“Once the feet are put right, all the rest of him will follow.”

“That wasn't exactly what I meant,”whispered Susan to Lucy. But it was too late to do anything about it now even if Aslan would have listened to her.The change was already creeping up the Giant's legs.Now he was moving his feet.A moment later he lifted his club off his shoulder, rubbed his eyes and said,

“Bless me!I must have been asleep. Now!Where's that drattedlittle Witch that was running about on the ground?Somewhere just by my feet it was.”But when everyone had shouted up to him to explain what had really happened, and when the Giant had put his hand to his ear and got them to repeat it all again so that at last he understood, then he bowed down till his head was no further off than the top of a haystack and touched his cap repeatedly to Aslan, beaming all over his honest ugly face.（Giants of any sort are now so rare in England and so few giants are good-tempered that ten to one you have never seen a giant when his face is beaming.It's a sight well worth looking at.）

“Now for the inside of this house!”said Aslan.“Look alive, everyone. Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady's chamber!Leave no corner unsearched.You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed.”

And into the interior they all rushed and for several minutes the whole of that dark, horrible, fusty old castle echoed with the opening of windows and with everyone's voices crying out at once,“Don't forget the dungeons—Give us a hand with this door!—Here's another little winding stair—Oh!I say. Here's a poor kangaroo.Call Aslan—Phew!How it smells in here—Look out for trap-doors—Up here!There are a whole lot more on the landing!”But the best of all was when Lucy came rushing upstairs shouting out,

“Aslan!Aslan!I've found Mr Tumnus. Oh, do come quick.”

A moment later Lucy and the little Faun were holding each other by both hands and dancing round and round for joy. The little chap was none the worse for having been a statue and was of course very interested in all she had to tell him.

But at last the ransacking of the Witch's fortress was ended. The whole castle stood empty with every door and window open and the light and the sweet spring air fooding into all the dark and evil places whichneeded them so badly.The whole crowd of liberated statues surged back into the courtyard.And it was then that someone（Tumnus, I think）frst said,

“But how are we going to get out?”for Aslan had got in by a jump and the gates were still locked.

“That'll be all right,”said Aslan;and then, rising on his hind legs, he bawled up at the Giant.“Hi!You up there,”he roared.“What's your name?”

“Giant Rumblebuffn, if it please your honour,”said the Giant, once more touching his cap.

“Well then, Giant Rumblebuffn,”said Aslan,“just let us out of this, will you?”

“Certainly, your honour. It will be a pleasure,”said Giant Rumblebuffn.“Stand well away from the gates, all you little'uns.”Then he strode to the gate himself and bang—bang—bang—went his huge club.The gates creaked at the frst blow, cracked at the second, and shivered at the third.Then he tackled the towers on each side of them and after a few minutes of crashing and thudding both the towers and a good bit of the wall on each side went thundering down in a mass of hopeless rubble;and when the dust cleared it was odd, standing in that dry, grim, stony yard, to see through the gap all the grass and waving trees and sparkling streams of the forest, and the blue hills beyond that and beyond them the sky.

“Blowed if I ain't all in a muck sweat,”said the Giant, puffng like the largest railway engine.“Comes of being out of condition. I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket-handkerchee about you?”

“Yes, I have,”said Lucy, standing on tip-toes and holding her handkerchief up as far as she could reach.

“Thank you, Missie,”said Giant Rumblebuffn, stooping down. Nextmoment Lucy got rather a fright for she found herself caught up in mid-air between the Giant's fnger and thumb.But just as she was getting near his face he suddenly started and then put her gently back on the ground muttering,“Bless me!I've picked up the little girl instead.I beg your pardon, Missie, I thought youwas the handkerchee!”

“No, no,”said Lucy, laughing,“here it is!”This time he managed to get it but it was only about the same size to him that a saccharine tablet would be to you, so that when she saw him solemnly rubbing it to and fro across his great red face, she said,“I'm afraid it's not much use to you, Mr Rumblebuffn.”

“Not at all. Not at all,”said the giant politely.“Never met a nicer handkerchee.So fne, so handy.So—I don't know how to describe it.”

“What a nice giant he is!”said Lucy to Mr Tumnus.

“Oh yes,”replied the Faun.“All the Buffns always were. One of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia.Not very clever, perhaps（I never knew a giant that was），but an old family.With traditions, you know.If he'd been the other sort she'd never have turned him into stone.”

At this point Aslan clapped his paws together and called for silence.

“Our day's work is not yet over,”he said,“and if the Witch is to be fnally defeated before bedtime we must fnd the battle at once.”

“And join in, I hope, sir!”added the largest of the Centaurs.

“Of course,”said Aslan.“And now!Those who can't keep up—that is, children, dwarfs, and small animals—must ride on the backs of those who can—that is, lions, centaurs, unicorns, horses, giants and eagles. Those who are good with their noses must come in front with us lions to smell out where the battle is.Look lively and sort yourselves.”

And with a great deal of bustle and cheering they did. The most pleased of the lot was the other lion who kept running about everywhere pretending to be very busy but really in order to say to everyone he met.“Did you hear what he said?Us Lions.That means him and me.Us Lions.That's what I like about Aslan.No side, no stand-off-ishness.Us Lions.That meant him and me.”At least he went on saying this till Aslan had loaded him up with three dwarfs, one dryad, two rabbits, and a hedgehog.That steadied him a bit.

When all were ready（it was a big sheep-dog who actually helped Aslan most in getting them sorted into their proper order）they set out through the gap in the castle wall. At frst the lions and dogs went nosing about in all directions.But then suddenly one great hound picked up the scent and gave a bay.There was no time lost after that.Soon all the dogs and lions and wolves and other hunting animals were going at full speed with their noses to the ground, and all the others, streaked out for about half a mile behind them, were following as fast as they could.The noise was like an English fox-hunt only better because every now and then with the music of the hounds was mixed the roar of the other lion and sometimes the far deeper and more awful roar of Aslan himself.Faster and faster they went as the scent became easier and easier to follow.And then, just as they came to the last curve in a narrow, winding valley, Lucy heard above all these noises another noise—a different one, which gave her a queer feeling inside.It was a noise of shouts and shrieks and of the clashing of metal against metal.

Then they came out of the narrow valley and at once she saw the reason. There stood Peter and Edmund and all the rest of Aslan's army fighting desperately against the crowd of horrible creatures whom she had seen last night;only now, in the daylight, they looked even stranger and more evil and more deformed.There also seemed to be far more of them.Peter's army—which had their backs to her—looked terribly few.And there were statues dotted all over the battlefield, so apparently the Witch had been using her wand.But she did not seem to be using it now.She was fghting with her stone knife.It was Peter she was fghting—both of them going at it so hard that Lucy could hardly make out what was happening;she only saw the stone knife and Peter's sword flashing so quickly that they looked like three knives and three swords.That pair were in the centre.On each side the line stretched out.Horrible things were happening wherever she looked.

“Off my back, children,”shouted Aslan. And they both tumbled off.Then with a roar that shook all Narnia from the western lamp-post to the shores of the eastern sea the great beast flung himself upon the White Witch.Lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement.Then Lion and Witch had rolled over together but with the Witch underneath;and at the same moment all war-like creatures whom Aslan had led from the Witch's house rushed madly on the enemy lines, dwarfs with their battleaxes, dogs with teeth, the Giant with his club（and his feet also crushed dozens of the foe），unicorns with their horns, centaurs with swords and hoofs.And Peter's tired army cheered, and the newcomers roared, and the enemy squealed and gibbered till the wood re-echoed with the din of that onset.





CHAPTER 17 THE HUNTING OF THE WHITE STAG


THE battle was all over a few minutes after their arrival. Most of the enemy had been killed in the frst charge of Aslan and his companions;and when those who were still living saw that the Witch was dead they either gave themselves up or took to fight.The next thing that Lucy knew was that Peter and Aslan were shaking hands.It was strange to her to see Peter looking as he looked now—his face was so pale and stern and he seemed so much older.

“It was all Edmund's doing, Aslan,”Peter was saying.“We'd have been beaten if it hadn't been for him. The Witch was turning our troops into stone right and left.But nothing would stop him.He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue.And when he reached her he had sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pains.That was the mistake all the rest were making.Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance—if we hadn't lost so many already.He was terribly wounded.We must go and see him.”

They found Edmund in charge of Mrs Beaver a little way back from the fghting line. He was covered with blood, his mouth was open, and his face a nasty green colour.

“Quick, Lucy,”said Aslan.

And then, almost for the frst time, Lucy remembered the precious cordial that had been given her for a Christmas present. Her hands trembled so much that she could hardly undo the stopper, but she managed it in the end and poured a few drops into her brother's mouth.

“There are other people wounded,”said Aslan while she was still looking eagerly into Edmund's pale face and wondering if the cordial would have any result.

“Yes, I know,”said Lucy crossly.“Wait a minute.”

“Daughter of Eve,”said Aslan in a graver voice,“others also are at the point of death. Mustmore people die for Edmund?”

“I'm sorry, Aslan,”said Lucy, getting up and going with him. And for the next half-hour they were busy—she attending to the wounded while he restored those who had been turned into stone.When at last she was free to come back to Edmund she found him standing on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look—oh, for ages;in fact ever since his frst term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong.He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face.And there on the feld of battle Aslan made him a knight.

“Does he know,”whispered Lucy to Susan,“what Aslan did for him?Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was?”

“Hush!No. Of course not,”said Susan.

“Oughtn't he to be told?”said Lucy.

“Oh, surely not,”said Susan.“It would be too awful for him. Think how you'd feel if you were he.”

“All the same I think he ought to know,”said Lucy. But at that moment they were interrupted.

That night they slept where they were. How Aslan provided food for them all I don't know;but somehow or other they found themselvesall sitting down on the grass to a fne high tea at about eight o'clock.The next day they began marching eastward down the side of the great river.And the next day after that, at about teatime, they actually reached the mouth.The castle of Cair Paravel on its little hill towered up above them;before them were the sands, with rocks and little pools of salt water, and seaweed, and the smell of the sea and long miles of bluish-green waves breaking for ever and ever on the beach.And oh, the cry of the sea-gulls!Have you heard it?Can you remember?

That evening after tea the four children all managed to get down to the beach again and get their shoes and stockings off and feel the sand between their toes. But next day was more solemn.For then, in the Great Hall of Cair Paravel—that wonderful hall with the ivory roof and the west wall hung with peacock's feathers and the eastern door which looks towards the sea, in the presence of all their friends and to the sound of trumpets, Aslan solemnly crowned them and led them to the four thrones amid deafening shouts of,“Long Live King Peter!Long Live Queen Susan!Long Live King Edmund!Long Live Queen Lucy!”

“Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen. Bear it well, Sons of Adam!Bear it well, Daughters of Eve!”said Aslan.

And through the eastern door, which was wide open, came the voices of the mermen and the mermaids swimming close to the shore and singing in honour of their new Kings and Queens.

So the children sat on their thrones, and sceptres were put into their hands and they gave rewards and honours to all their friends, to Tumnus the Faun, and to the Beavers, and Giant Rumblebuffin, to the leopards, and the good centaurs, and the good dwarfs, and to the lion. And that night there was a great feast in Cair Paravel, and revelry and dancing, and gold fashed and wine fowed, and answering to the music inside, but stranger, sweeter, and more piercing, came the music of the sea people.

But amidst all these rejoicings Aslan himself quietly slipped away. And when the Kings and Queens noticed that he wasn't there they said nothing about it.For Mr Beaver had warned them.“He'll be coming and going,”he had said.“One day you'll see him and another you won't.He doesn't like being tied down—and of course he has other countries to attend to.It's quite all right.He'll often drop in.Only you mustn't press him.He's wild, you know.Not like atame lion.”

And now, as you see, this story is nearly（but not quite）at an end. These two Kings and two Queens governed Narnia well, and long and happy was their reign.At frst much of their time was spent in seeking out the remnants of the White Witch's army and destroying them, and indeed for a long time there would be news of evil things lurking in the wilder parts of the forest—a haunting here and a killing there, a glimpse of a werewolf one month and a rumour of a hag the next.But in the end all that foul brood was stamped out.And they made good laws and kept the peace and saved good trees from being unnecessarily cut down, and liberated young dwarfs and young satyrs from being sent to school, and generally stopped busybodies and interferers and encouraged ordinary people who wanted to live and let live.And they drove back the ferce giants（quite a different sort from Giant Rumblebuffn）on the north of Narnia when these ventured across the frontier.And they entered into friendship and alliance with countries beyond the sea and paid them visits of state and received visits of state from them.And they themselves grew and changed as the years passed over them.And Peter became a tall and deep-chested man and a great warrior, and he was called King Peter the Magnifcent.And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage.And she was called Queen Susan the Gentle.Edmund was a graver and quieter man than Peter, and great in council and judgement.Hewas called King Edmund the Just.But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her own people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.

So they lived in great joy and if ever they remembered their life in this world it was only as one remembers a dream. And one year it fell out that Tumnus（who was a middle-aged Faun by now and beginning to be stout）came down river and brought them news that the White Stag had once more appeared in his parts—the White Stag who would give you wishes if you caught him.So these two Kings and two Queens with the principal members of their court, rode a-hunting with horns and hounds in the Western Woods to follow the White Stag.And they had not hunted long before they had a sight of him.And he led them a great pace over rough and smooth and through thick and thin, till the horses of all the courtiers were tired out and these four were still following.And they saw the stag enter into a thicket where their horses could not follow.Then said King Peter（for they talked in quite a different style now, having been Kings and Queens for so long），“Fair Consorts, let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket;for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry.”

“Sir,”said the others,“even so let us do.”

So they alighted and tied their horses to trees and went on into the thick wood on foot. And as soon as they had entered it Queen Susan said,

“Fair friends, here is a great marvel, for I seem to see a tree of iron.”

“Madam,”said King Edmund,“if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof.”

“By the Lion's Mane, a strange device,”said King Peter,“to set a lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man!”

“Sir,”said Queen Lucy.“By likelihood when this post and this lampwere set here there were smaller trees in the place, or fewer, or none. For this is a young wood and the iron post is old.”And they stood looking upon it.

Then said King Edmund,“I know not how it is, but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely. It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before;as it were in a dream, or in the dream of a dream.”

“Sir,”answered they all,“it is even so with us also.”

“And more,”said Queen Lucy,“for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern either we shall fnd strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes.”

“Madam,”said King Edmund,“the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also.”

“And in mine, fair brother,”said King Peter.

“And in mine too,”said Queen Susan.“Wherefore by my counsel we shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further.”

“Madam,”said King Peter,“therein I pray thee to have me excused. For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter, as battles, quests, feats of arms, acts of justice, and the like, and then given over;but always what we have taken in hand, the same we have achieved.”

“Sister,”said Queen Lucy,“my royal brother speaks rightly. And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase.”

“And so say I,”said King Edmund.“And I have such desire to fnd the signifcation of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands.”

“Then in the name of Aslan,”said Queen Susan,“if ye will all have it so, let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us.”

So these Kings and Queens entered the thicket, and before theyhad gone a score of paces they all remembered that the thing they had seen was called a lamp-post, and before they had gone twenty more they noticed that they were making their way not through branches but through coats. And next moment they all came tumbling out of a wardrobe door into the empty room, and they were no longer Kings and Queens in their hunting array but just Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in their old clothes.It was the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide.Mrs Macready and the visitors were still talking in the passage;but luckily they never came into the empty room and so the children weren't caught.

And that would have been the very end of the story if it hadn't been that they felt they really must explain to the Professor why four of the coats out of his wardrobe were missing. And the Professor, who was a very remarkable man, didn't tell them not to be silly or not to tell lies, but believed the whole story.“No,”he said,“I don't think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats.You won't get into Narnia again by that route.Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did!Eh?What's that?Yes, of course you'll get back to Narnia again some day.Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia.But don't go trying to use the same route twice.Indeed, don't try to get there at all.It'll happen when you're not looking for it.And don't talk too much about it even among yourselves.And don't mention it to anyone else unless you fnd that they've had adventures of the same sort themselves.What's that?How will you know?Oh, you'll know all right.Odd things they say—even their looks—will let the secret out.Keep your eyes open.Bless me, whatdo they teach them at these schools?

And that is the very end of the adventure of the wardrobe. But if the Professor was right, it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia.
