狐狸和葡萄


一架葡萄沿着一个高高的葡萄架生长，几串很好的葡萄垂下来。一只饥饿的狐狸看到了，费了很大力气，又蹦又跳，却怎么也够不到。这简直是白费力气，因为葡萄长得太高了。于是，狐狸放弃了，趾高气扬、漫不经心地大步走开，边走边说：“我原以为这些葡萄已经熟了，但现在一想，它们肯定很酸。”





下金蛋的鹅


一对夫妻非常走运，他们有一只会下金蛋的鹅，这只鹅每天都能下一个金蛋。尽管如此走运，但没多久他们就开始觉得他们富裕起来的速度不够快，于是猜测那只鹅的身体里肯定也全都是金子，于是他们决定把鹅杀了，一次性地将里面的财宝都拿到。但是当他们把鹅开膛破肚，却发现那只鹅和普通的鹅没有什么区别。因此，他们没有像他们所期望的那样一下子变成有钱人，而且再也无法享受到财富每天都有所增加的幸福了。

训诫：贪得无厌者满盘皆输。





猫和老鼠


从前有一栋房子，里面老鼠成灾。有一只猫听说了，便想：“这个地方适合我去。”于是，她出发去房子里面安家，将老鼠一个个地抓住吃掉。最后，老鼠们无法忍受了，决定待在洞里不再出去。“真麻烦，”猫自言自语，“现在只能设个陷阱引他们出来了。”所以，她思考了一阵子，然后爬到墙上，后腿从木桩上垂下来，在那里装死。没过多久，有一只老鼠从洞里往外看，发现猫挂在那里。“啊哈！”它叫道，“你可真聪明啊，猫女士，毫无疑问，但是你就算把自己装成一袋子肉挂在那里，你也根本不可能引得我们走近你的身边。”

训诫：聪明的人不会被那些证实很危险的东西露出来的安全假象蒙蔽。





恶犬


从前有一只狗，总是无缘无故地对着人乱叫或是咬人，所有到过狗主人家的人都觉得这只狗是个大麻烦。所以主人就在狗脖子上挂了一个铃铛，好给人们提个醒，告诉人们狗来了。狗得到铃铛之后很是骄傲，心满意足地晃来晃去，让铃铛响个不停。一只老狗对他说：“朋友，你最好还是别显摆了。你是不是以为给你铃铛是夸奖你啊？相反，这实际上是个耻辱的标记。”

训诫：恶名常被误当作美名。





烧炭工和漂洗工


从前，有一个烧炭工，他一个人生活，自力更生。有一个漂洗工碰巧搬到了他家附近，两个人熟了起来，烧炭工觉得漂洗工很好相处，于是便提出建议，问他是否愿意搬到他家，两个人同住。“这样子我们就能够更熟识，日常开支也能够省掉很多。”漂洗工表示感谢，但是拒绝了他的提议。“先生，我可真不觉得那样好。啊呀，我费尽力气洗干净的东西，全都会立刻被你的煤炭弄成黑色的。”





老鼠开会


从前，所有的老鼠集中在一起开大会，讨论如何自救，如何抵抗猫的攻击。他们提了好多个建议，互相争来争去。有一只有点身份和阅历的老鼠站了出来，说：“我已经有了一个计划，可以保证我们未来安全无忧，只要你们能够赞同并付诸实施。我们应该在我们的敌人——猫的脖子上挂一个铃铛，这样就能够提醒我们她来了。”这个提议赢得了热烈的掌声，老鼠们决定采纳这个建议，但是一只年长的老鼠站了起来，说：“我也认为你的建议非常好，只是，请问，谁去给猫挂铃铛呢？”





蝙蝠和黄鼠狼


有一只蝙蝠落到了地上，被一只黄鼠狼抓住了。蝙蝠马上就要被黄鼠狼杀死吃掉了，于是他向黄鼠狼求饶。黄鼠狼说他不能放了蝙蝠，因为他视所有的鸟类为仇敌。“啊呀，”蝙蝠说，“我根本不是鸟啊，我是老鼠。”“是这样啊，”黄鼠狼说，“那以后我会关照你的。”然后便将蝙蝠放走了。过了一段日子，蝙蝠又被另一只黄鼠狼抓住了，他又一次求饶。这只黄鼠狼说：“不行，我绝对不会放过任何老鼠的。”“但我不是老鼠啊，”蝙蝠说，“我是一只鸟。”“啊呀，还真是。”于是这只黄鼠狼也把蝙蝠放走了。

训诫：要会见机行事。





狗和母猪


有一只狗和一头母猪争论，他们都说自己的小崽子是最好的。“算啦，”母猪最后说道，“不管怎样，我的小崽子们一出生就能看到东西，你的那些小崽子生出来的时候却是瞎子。”





狐狸和乌鸦


乌鸦落在树枝上，嘴里叼着一块奶酪。狐狸看到，便开始琢磨怎么才能得到那块奶酪。他走到树下，坐下来，抬头看着乌鸦，说：“我仰望的是一只何其尊贵的鸟啊！她的美丽与世无双，她的羽毛精致华丽。但愿她的声音也像她的外表一样甜美，那她就无疑是鸟中女王了！”乌鸦听了这番恭维心中大喜，便想向狐狸展示一下自己的歌喉，于是“呱”地叫了一声。自然，奶酪应声落下，狐狸一下子扑上去，还对乌鸦说：“夫人，你的嗓子实在很好啊，不过，我看你的脑子差了点。”





狐狸和乌鸦





马和马夫


从前有一个马夫，他会花很长时间给他负责的马修毛梳洗，却每天都从喂马的燕麦里偷出一些来卖掉获利。那匹马的状况日渐糟糕，最后，他哭着对马夫说：“要是你真想让我看起来漂亮、有光彩，还是少给我梳洗多喂我些东西的好。”





狼和小羊


一只狼遇上了一只离群的小羊，想要吃了他，却又觉得就这么毫无正当理由地夺走一条无辜无助的生命实在很说不过去。他绞尽脑汁，最后说：“小子，去年你严重羞辱了我。”“不可能啊，先生，”小羊说，“那时候我还没出生呢。”“呃，”狼反驳，“你在我的草场里吃了草。”“不是我啊，”小羊回答，“我长这么大还没尝过草是什么味道呢。”“那你喝了我的泉水。”狼继续指责道。“实际上，先生，”可怜的小羊说，“除了我妈妈的奶以外，我还从来没有喝过别的东西呢。”“算啦，不管怎么说，”狼说，“我可不能饿肚子。”说完他扑向小羊，直接狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。





孔雀和鹤


有一只孔雀嘲笑一只鹤，说她的羽毛毫无光彩。“你看看我这羽毛的亮丽色彩，”孔雀说，“再看看我的羽毛比你的高级多少！”“我不否认，”鹤回答，“你的羽毛的确比我的漂亮多了。但是我的羽毛能让我翱翔于云端，而你的羽毛却把你压得像普通的家鸡一样只能待在地面上。”





猫和鸟


有一只猫听说有一伙群居的鸟生病了。于是他乔装打扮成医生，带着一些能证明自己身份的工具，出现在鸟的居所的门前，询问鸟儿们的健康情况。鸟儿们没有让他进门，他们说：“我们会好起来的，只要你不出现。”

训诫：坏蛋诡计多端，但无法欺骗智者。





猫和鸟





败家子和燕子


有一个败家子，他把家中的财产挥霍一空，除了身上穿的衣物，一无所有。一个早春的日子，天气晴朗，他看到了一只燕子，心想夏天就要来了，那么就没有必要穿大衣了。于是他便把大衣卖掉了换钱。但是，天有不测风云，一场猛烈的寒流袭来，那只可怜的燕子被冻死了。败家子看到燕子的尸体，哭道：“唉！倒霉的鸟！都是因为你，我也快要冻死了！”

训诫：一花不成春，一只燕子并不代表夏天来了。





老妇人和医生


有一个老妇人眼睛有病，几乎彻底瞎了。她去看了一个医生，在其他人的见证下，她和医生达成了一个协议：如果医生将她的眼睛治愈，她便付给医生高额的报酬；如果医生没有办法治好她的眼睛，那便什么也拿不到。医生制订了治疗方案，而他每次出诊去给老妇人治疗，便从老妇人家中带走一些家具。当疗程结束，他最后一次去看老妇人时，老妇人家中的东西已经被他拿光了。老妇人看到房子里空空如也，拒绝付给医生费用。老妇人一再拒绝之后，医生将她告上了法庭。老妇人上庭之后为自己辩护说：“原告已经准确无误地陈述了我们之间的协议：如果我被他治愈，便付费给他；如果他失败了，他承诺说什么费用都不收。现在，他说我好了，但是我得说，我比过去瞎得更厉害了。我可以证明的。过去我的眼睛起码还是能够看到我的房子里面装着好多家具和其他东西的；现在，他说我的眼睛好了，但是我在我的房子里面却什么也看不到。”





月亮和母亲


月亮恳求她的母亲给她做一件礼服。“怎么做啊？”母亲回答，“我没有办法让衣服的尺寸适合你啊。你有时候是新月，有时候是满月，还有时候既不是新月也不是满月。”





墨丘利和樵夫


一个樵夫从树上跌落到了河岸上，他的斧子从手中滑出，掉到了水里。当他站在水边伤心难过时，墨丘利出现在他的面前，问他为什么伤心。得知事情的经过后，墨丘利很同情这个樵夫，于是潜入水中，捞起了一把金斧子，问樵夫这是他丢失的斧子吗，樵夫回答说不是。墨丘利又潜入水中，捞起了一把银斧子，问樵夫这是他丢失的斧子吗，樵夫回答说：“不，这也不是我的。”于是墨丘利第三次潜入水中，捞起了他丢失的斧子。失而复得，樵夫大喜过望，非常热情地感谢自己的恩人。墨丘利很欣赏他的诚实，于是把另外两把斧子当作礼物送给了他。樵夫将这件事讲给自己的朋友听，其中有一个人很嫉妒他的好运，也想去试试自己的运气。于是他也到河边，故意从树上跌落下来，非常费力地让自己的斧子落入了河中。墨丘利又出现了，得知他的斧子掉入水中后便潜入了水中，捞起了一把金斧子，就像之前一样。而这次这个樵夫却没有等墨丘利问斧子是不是他的，就激动地叫起来：“这是我的！这是我的！”然后伸出手，满怀希望地去夺那把斧子，但是墨丘利因为樵夫的不诚实而非常厌恶他，不仅没有把这把金斧子交给他，而且也不愿意再下水帮他打捞那把掉入水中的斧子了。

训诫：诚实方为上策。





月亮和母亲





驴、狐狸和狮子


驴和狐狸交上了朋友，他们一起出发去寻找食物，没走出多远，便迎头遇上了一只狮子，他们都害怕得要命。但是，狐狸想到了一个自救的办法，于是他壮着胆子走到狮子跟前，附在他的耳边悄声说：“我可以设法帮你毫不费力地抓到那只驴，只要你能放了我。”狮子同意了，于是狐狸重新回到他的朋友身边，计划带着驴前往一个隐藏的陷坑，那是猎人挖来捕捉野生动物的陷阱。驴自然掉进了陷阱中。狮子看到驴被捉住，无路可逃了，就把注意力先放在了狐狸身上，很快便把狐狸给吞下吃光了，然后才悠闲地开始享用驴。

训诫：背叛朋友，常常也会毁了自己。





狮子和老鼠


狮子正在自己的巢穴中睡觉，一只老鼠从他脸上爬过，把他惊醒了。狮子勃然大怒，伸出爪子一把抓住老鼠，准备杀了他。老鼠万分惊恐，可怜兮兮地恳求狮子饶他一命。“放我走吧，”老鼠说，“总有一天我会报答你的大恩大德的。”这么个小不点，居然说能为他做事，狮子觉得好笑极了，但还是心情愉悦地把老鼠放了。而老鼠所说的那一天终于还是来到了。一天，狮子被猎人设下的网给困住了，老鼠听到声音，认出是那头狮子的怒吼，于是跑了过去。他二话没说，便开始咬啮绳子，没用多久便成功将狮子放了出来。“看！”老鼠说，“我承诺会报答你的时候你还笑我呢，现在看来，老鼠尽管小，也是能够帮助狮子的。”





乌鸦和水罐


一只乌鸦口渴了，找到了一只装着水的水罐，不过水罐中的水很少，她试了半天，嘴巴总是够不到水。唉，尽管水就在眼前，她也可能会被活活渴死的。最后，她灵光一闪，想到了一个主意。她捡起小石子丢到水罐中，每丢进去一颗石子，水面就上升一点，到了最后，乌鸦的嘴巴终于碰到水面了。这只聪明的乌鸦解了渴。

训诫：需要是发明之母。





男孩和青蛙


几个调皮的男孩在一个池塘边玩游戏，看到一些青蛙在浅浅的水池中游动，为了找乐子，他们便朝青蛙丢石头，好多青蛙因此丧生。最后，有一只青蛙将头露出水面，说道：“天啊，快停下！快停下！求求你们了，你们觉得好玩，可却要了我们的命。”





北风和太阳


北风和太阳之间起了争执，他们都认为自己比对方强大。最后，他们两个决定比一比，看谁能让一个走路的人更快脱掉斗篷。北风先开始，他聚集起所有的力量发动攻击，呼啸着袭向那个人，想凭借一己之力将他的斗篷扯下来。但是他越是用力，那个人把斗篷裹得越紧。然后轮到太阳出手了。起初他只是柔和地照着路人，路人很快松开了斗篷，任斗篷松松垮垮地搭在肩上。最后太阳开始发威，光芒四射，路人没走几步便将斗篷脱了下来，轻装上路。

训诫：劝说比武力更有效。





女主人和仆人


有一个寡妇，生性节俭，勤勤恳恳，她家里有两个仆人，都被她安排了很辛苦的工作。他们早晨没有办法赖床，晨鸡一报晓，女主人就会叫他们起床开始工作。他们都很不喜欢这么早就起床，尤其是冬天的时候。于是他们想，如果能够让鸡别那么早叫醒女主人，那他们就能多睡一会儿了。所以，他们抓住鸡，扭断了它的脖子。但是他们并没有如愿以偿，女主人听不到鸡鸣，叫他们起床的时间却比过去更早了，几乎还在半夜就把他们喊起来干活了。





善与恶


从前，世界初形成之时，善与恶在人们的心中是平等的，行善并不会受到称赞，作恶也不会带来不幸。但是由于人类的愚蠢，恶开始不断增加，恶的力量不断强大，似乎要占取善在人们中间的份额了，要将善驱逐出人间了。因此，善便去了天庭，向朱庇特控诉他们受到的不公正对待，同时祈求他来保护人类，使他们远离恶，还就他们善与人类的关系征询他的建议。朱庇特答应了他们要求庇护的请求，下令将来善不能公开进入人间，因为那样容易受到充满恶意的恶的攻击，善应该悄悄地、一点点地，以一种不频繁的、人们意料之外的方式回到人间。因此，人间充满了恶，他们可以任意来去，但却永远都不会走远，而善呢，却只能一个一个地单独出现，需要想尽办法从天庭一路下来，所以人间善行很少见。





野兔和青蛙


有一回，野兔们聚集在一起，共同哀叹命运不好，他们总是四面受敌，却又没有足够的力量和勇气保护自己。人、狗、飞禽、走兽全都是他们的敌人，日复一日地杀戮、吞吃他们。他们再也无法忍受这种迫害了，他们一致决定要结束这种悲惨的命运。由于绝望，他们集体奔向附近的一个池塘，想要跳水自杀。池塘岸边坐着一些青蛙，他们听到野兔们的声音，全都跳入水中，藏在了深处。这时，一只最聪明的老野兔冲伙伴们喊道：“停下，朋友们，振作起来！咱们还是别自杀了，你们看看，那些小东西这么害怕我们，肯定比我们还胆小。”





狐狸和鹳


狐狸邀请鹳来吃饭，结果却只提供装在浅盘子中的汤，狐狸津津有味地舔食着，但是鹳的喙长长的，她没有办法喝到那美味的汤。她十分狼狈，狡猾的狐狸心中大快。没过多久，鹳回请狐狸，她把食物装在瓶颈细长的水瓶里，鹳可以把喙轻松地探进去，享受自己的晚餐，狐狸却只能无助地坐在旁边，饥肠辘辘，根本没有办法吃到里面的美食。





披着羊皮的狼


一只狼决心乔装打扮，悄悄地混进羊群。他披上了一身羊皮，趁羊群在草地上吃草的时候溜进了羊群。他完全骗过了牧羊人。晚上，羊群被赶进羊圈过夜，他也进入了羊圈。但是就在那天晚上，牧羊人决定吃羊肉，于是伸手把那只“羊”给抓了出来，手起刀落，狼被杀掉了。





牛棚里的雄鹿


一只雄鹿被猎狗追踪，他从自己的藏身处跑出来，躲到了一处农家宅院，藏进一间牛棚。他看到一个空牛栏中堆了一堆干草，便一头扎了进去，藏了起来，只是鹿角的尖还露在外面。不久，一头公牛对他说：“你是怎么跑到这里来的呀？你不知道你这么做可能会被牧人抓住吗？”雄鹿说：“求求你让我先在这儿躲一会儿吧。等天黑了，我就能趁着黑暗逃跑了。”那天下午，好几个农场里的人进了牛棚，照料牲口，但是都没有发现雄鹿。雄鹿心中庆幸自己逃脱了厄运，于是向公牛表示感谢。之前跟他说话的那头牛回答说：“我们很希望你能平安，不过你还没有脱离危险呢。如果主人来了，你肯定会被发现的，什么东西都逃不过他敏锐的眼睛。”不一会儿，主人来了，因为公牛的状况折腾了一大通。他大叫道：“牲口们全都饿了，快来给他们添草，给他们身下多放些褥草。”他说话的时候，离雄鹿藏身的草垛只有一步之遥，他很快就发现了雄鹿，马上叫来了人，抓住了鹿并将鹿杀了，把鹿肉当作了晚餐。





挤奶女工和奶桶


一个农夫的女儿挤完了牛奶，把奶桶顶在头顶上往回走。她一边走一边开心地想：“这桶里的奶可以用来做奶油，我可以做成黄油拿到市场上去卖，有了钱我就可以买些鸡蛋回来，然后孵出小鸡来，鸡生蛋，蛋生鸡，我就能有一个很大的家禽场。然后我就可以卖掉一些鸡，拿卖鸡的钱来给自己买条新裙子。我穿着新裙子去市场，所有的年轻人都会眼前一亮，跑来向我求爱，我会高傲地甩开头，不理他们。”她一直想着这些，忘了头顶上的奶桶，想着想着就做出了相应的动作，甩了一下头，于是奶桶从她头上滚落，所有的奶都洒了出来，她刚才空想出来的一切，全都一瞬间消失了。

训诫：不要过早乐观。





海豚、鲸和鲱鱼


海豚和鲸争吵了起来，没多久便打了起来。战斗十分激烈，持续了很长时间也没有结束的迹象。一条鲱鱼认为自己也许能够中止这场战争，所以他走入战场，想要说服双方放弃战斗，言归于好。但是一只海豚轻蔑地对他说：“我们宁可继续厮杀到我们都死亡，也不愿意被你这样的小东西来劝和。”





狐狸和猴子


狐狸和猴子一起走在路上，为了谁的出身更好争论了起来。两个人吵了一段时间，直到他们路过一片公墓，那里有很多墓碑，猴子停了下来，环顾四周，长叹一口气。狐狸问：“你为什么叹气啊？”猴子指着那些坟墓回答说：“你看看这些墓碑，全都是为了纪念我的祖辈而立，他们生前可全都是伟人啊。”狐狸先是无言以对，然后很快恢复正常，说道：“哎呀！接着扯谎吧，先生，没事的，我肯定你的那些祖先不会爬出来揭穿你的。”

训诫：吹牛的人在无法被揭穿时吹得最大。





驴和哈巴狗


从前有一个人，养了一头驴和一只哈巴狗。驴被养在畜舍中，燕麦、干草充足，对于一头驴来说，可算是享尽了福。小狗很得主人宠爱，时时受到爱抚，主人还经常让他趴在自己腿上，如果主人出去吃饭，小狗听到主人回家，总是跑出去迎接，而主人也总是会带回来一两样美味佳肴给小狗。而驴有很多工作要做，要拉车，要推磨，或是驮运农场需要的重物，所以时间一长，他就嫉妒起了小狗：他任劳任怨辛苦流汗，而小狗却悠闲自在无所事事。终于有一天，驴挣脱了缰绳，蹦跳着冲向屋子。此时，主人正在屋中吃饭。驴欢腾跳跃，模仿起小狗来，结果却掀翻了桌子，将桌上的陶瓷器皿全都给打碎了。即便如此，他还是不甘心，想要跳上主人的膝盖，因为他经常看到小狗这样做。就在这时，家里的仆人看到主人身处危险，便用棍棒狠狠地打向驴，把他打了个半死，赶回了畜舍。驴哀号：“唉！这全都是我咎由自取啊。我为什么不满足于我本来的地位呢？我干吗要学那无用的小哈巴狗的滑稽举动？”





枞树和荆棘


一棵枞树跟一株荆棘吹嘘自己，语气中满是轻蔑：“你这可怜的东西，没有半点用。看看我，我用处多大，特别是盖房子的时候，人们根本离不开我。”但是荆棘却回复：“哎呀，那的确是好，不过等到他们拿着斧子、锯子来把你砍倒的时候，你就会宁愿自己是荆棘而不是枞树了。”

训诫：无忧无虑的贫穷胜过担着诸多责任的富有。





青蛙怨日


从前有一回，太阳想要娶个妻子，青蛙们都惊恐不安，提高了声音向天空鸣叫，朱庇特听到了这噪音，就问他们为什么叫唤。他们回答说：“太阳单身的时候已经够恶毒了，总是把我们的沼泽烤干。如果他结了婚生了小太阳我们会如何呢？”





狗、公鸡和狐狸


一只狗和一只公鸡成了朋友，两个人结伴去旅行。到了晚上，公鸡飞到一棵树的树枝上休息，而狗则钻进了树干上的树洞里。第二天早晨，公鸡醒来，如同平常一样开始打鸣。狐狸听到了，准备把公鸡抓去当早餐，于是来到树下，哄公鸡下来。“我特别想和嗓音这么动听的动物交朋友。”公鸡回答说：“那你能不能去叫醒我的门房呢？他就睡在树根那里，他会把门给你打开放你进来的。”狐狸听了，便敲了敲树干，狗从树洞里钻出来，将他撕成了碎片。





枞树和荆棘





蚊子和公牛


一只蚊子落在了一头公牛的犄角上，在那儿停留了一段时间。他休息够了，准备飞走的时候，便问公牛：“你介意我现在走吗？”公牛只是微微抬了抬眼睛，漠不关心地说：“对我来说你走不走没什么区别：我根本没有注意到你什么时候来的，也根本不会在意你什么时候走。”

训诫：我们总是以为自己很重要，实则在邻人眼中根本不是如此。





熊和旅行者


有两个旅行者一起旅行，这时突然冒出来一只熊。熊还没有注意到他们，其中一个人就爬上了路边的树，钻进树枝里藏了起来。另一个人没有同伴那么敏捷，没有办法逃脱，便躺在地上装死。熊走了过来，在他身边闻来闻去，他一动不动，屏住呼吸，因为他听人说熊不会碰死尸。熊真的把他当成了尸体，于是就走开了。当危险解除后，树上藏着的那个人下来了，问同伴熊把嘴凑到他耳朵边到底跟他说了什么悄悄话。他的同伴回答说：“他告诉我，永远不要和一遇到危险就把你丢下的人一起上路。”

训诫：患难见真情。





奴隶和狮子


有一个奴隶，因一直遭到主人的残酷虐待，从主人身边逃走了。为了躲避追捕，他逃到了大沙漠中。他四处寻找食物和隐蔽之所，后来发现了一个山洞，进去一看，里面并没有人。然而，实际上，这是一只狮子的洞穴。不一会儿，狮子便现身了，将这可怜的逃奴吓了一大跳。奴隶认为自己小命休矣，准备听天由命，但令他大吃一惊的是，狮子并没有跳过来扑向他把他吞掉，而是走过来开始讨好他，举着爪子呜呜哀叫。奴隶发现狮子的爪子红肿发炎，于是仔细地检查了一下，发现狮子脚掌当中扎了一根荆棘。他便帮狮子把这刺拔了出来，尽可能地包扎好了伤口。后来狮子的伤口彻底痊愈了，他对逃奴感激至深，将这个人视作自己的朋友，和他共用这个山洞。不过，有一天，逃奴又开始渴望起人类的朋友来，于是他作别狮子，回到了城里。一到城里，他就被认出来并被捆绑着送到他从前的主人面前。主人决定狠狠惩罚他以儆效尤，宣布在下一次斗兽场的开放日，将他丢去喂野兽。到了那天，野兽都被放进了斗兽场中，其中有一只狮子，身形硕大，外表吓人。可怜的逃奴被丢到了野兽群中。而令观众们大吃一惊的是，狮子抬头看了逃奴一眼，便一跃过去，卧在了逃奴脚下，全身上下都透着喜悦和快乐。他就是逃奴在山洞中的老朋友！观众们大声嚷嚷，认为奴隶的罪应该被赦免。城市的总督也因这只动物身上展现出来的感激和忠诚而大为惊叹，判决那只狮子和那个奴隶都应该重获自由。





跳蚤和人


有一只跳蚤叮了人一口，然后又叮了一口，后来一次接着一次地叮，人最后无法忍受了，于是便全身检查，最终抓到了跳蚤。他将跳蚤捏在拇指和食指间，说——确切地说应该是喊，因为他实在很愤怒：“你到底是谁啊，你这个卑鄙的小东西，就这么在我身上为所欲为？”跳蚤害怕了，啜泣着，用微弱的声音说：“噢，先生啊，求求你放了我吧，千万不要杀我！我就是这么个小东西而已，根本不会给你造成什么伤害。”但是人笑着说：“我就是要立刻杀了你：恶有恶报，不管他造成的是多么小的伤害。”

训诫：不要虚掷同情在坏蛋身上。





跳蚤和人





蜜蜂和朱庇特


一只哈米特的蜂后带着蜂巢里的新鲜蜂蜜，飞去奥林匹斯山敬献给朱庇特，朱庇特收到礼物十分喜悦，说可以满足蜂后的任何要求。蜂后说，如果朱庇特能够让蜜蜂拥有刺去杀死抢夺他们的蜂蜜的人，她会十分感激。对这个要求，朱庇特大失所望，因为他很喜欢人类。但是他已经许下了诺言，所以便答应蜜蜂他们可以有刺。尽管他给了蜜蜂刺，但是蜜蜂叮完人，刺便会留在人的伤口中，而蜜蜂却会死去。

训诫：恶意自有恶报。





栎树和芦苇


一棵栎树长在河岸边，遇到一场暴风，被连根拔起，抛到了河对岸。他落在了水边生长的芦苇中，对他们说：“这是怎么回事啊？你们这么脆弱，居然能够平安度过风暴，而我呢，强大有力，却被连根拔起丢到了河里。”芦苇回答说：“你是固执，和风暴对抗，而对方的力量却强过你，即便是微风我们也低头屈服，强风自然掠过我们头顶。”





栎树和芦苇





盲人和狼崽


有一个盲人，他的触觉十分灵敏，任何动物只要放到他手里，他摸一摸，就能知道那是什么。有一天，有人将一只狼崽放到了他手里，问他那是什么。他考虑了一下，才说：“我的确不太肯定这是狼崽还是狐狸崽子，但是我知道，这东西绝对不能放到羊圈里。”

训诫：防微杜渐，将危险扼杀于萌芽中。





男孩和蜗牛


一个农夫的儿子去捉蜗牛，两只手都捉满之后，他准备生火把蜗牛烤了吃掉。火点起来之后，蜗牛感受到了热度，便纷纷从壳里钻了出来，嘶嘶地叫着，他们每次从壳里出来都会发出这种声音。男孩听了，说：“你们这些无耻的小东西啊，你们的房子都被烤得着火了，你们怎么还有闲心唱歌呢？”





猿和两个旅行者


有两个旅行者一起出门旅行，其中一个从没说过真话，而另一个却从来都不撒谎。他们在旅行途中，来到了猿猴的国度。猿王听说了这两个人，就命令手下带他们过来。为了给旅行者们留下深刻印象，他坐在王座之上接待了他们。而他手下的众多猿猴，排成长长的队伍，分列于两侧。旅行者被带到他面前，他问他们，他这个国王如何。说谎话的旅行者回答：“陛下，每个人都会认为你是最高贵、最强大的君主。”“那我的臣民如何？”猿王继续问道。旅行者回答：“他们与他们高贵的主人十分相配。”听了他的回答，猿王十分开心，热情款待了他。另一个旅行者想，既然他的同伴因为说了假话而受到如此款待，那他讲真话的话，肯定会得到更丰厚的奖赏。于是，当猿王问他：“先生，你觉得如何呢？”他回答说：“我觉得你是一只很好的猿猴，你的臣民也都是很好的猿猴。”猿王听了暴怒，命令手下将他带到一边撕碎处死。





驴和货品


有一个小贩，他有一头驴。有一天他购进了一些盐，依据驴的负担能力，将最大量的盐放在了驴背上。回家路上，他们要涉过一条小溪，驴脚下不稳，摔进了水里。盐整个儿被水浸湿，大部分都溶化掉了，所以，驴重新站稳的时候，发现负担轻了好多。不过他的主人赶着他回了城里，又买了一些盐。小贩把盐放入箩筐，再度出发。他们一到小溪，驴就故意躺进溪水中，等起来时，和上次一样，负担又轻了许多。主人察觉到了他的把戏，于是赶着驴又回到了城里，这次买了好多海绵，放在了驴的背上。等他们第三次来到小溪，驴又故意躺下，而这次，海绵吸收了大量的水分，等驴站起来的时候，发现背上的负重增加了很多。

训诫：便宜不要多占。





牧童和狼


有一个牧羊人的儿子，在村子附近放牧，觉得假装狼攻击了羊群来骗骗村民应该挺有乐子的，所以便大叫：“狼来了！狼来了！”等人们纷纷跑来，他大肆嘲笑他们白费了一番力气。后来他又故技重演，村民们都发现自己被耍了，因为根本没有狼。后来有一天，狼真的来了，男孩大叫：“狼来了！狼来了！”他费尽力气，叫破了喉咙，而村民却都已经听而不闻，根本没有理会。所以狼一路横行无阻，好整以暇地吃了一只又一只羊。

训诫：骗子讲真话，也不会有人信。





狐狸和山羊


有一只狐狸掉进了一口井中，用尽了办法也爬不上来。没过多久，有一只口渴的山羊过来，看到狐狸在井中，便问他井水好不好。“好不好？”狐狸回答，“这简直是我这辈子喝过的最好的水了。你自己下来尝尝吧。”山羊不假思索，一心只想解渴，便立刻跳进了井里。等他喝够了水，便像狐狸一样，开始想办法要出去，却也找不到办法。这时，狐狸说：“我有一个主意。你用后腿支撑身体，把前腿搭在井壁上，我顺着你的背爬上去，踩着你的犄角，我就能够出去了。到时候我再帮你出去。”山羊依计而行，狐狸爬到了山羊背上，然后爬出了井，接着便无耻地走了。山羊大声地叫他回来，提醒他遵守刚才许下的诺言，帮自己出去。但是狐狸只是回过头说：“你脑子里的主意要是跟你的胡子一样多，就根本不会在确定是否能够出去之前就下井去。”

训诫：三思而后行。





渔夫和小鲱鱼


有一个渔夫撒网到海里，拉上来的时候，发现网里面只有一条小鲱鱼，其余毫无所获。小鲱鱼乞求渔夫把它放回大海：“我现在只不过是条小鱼，但有一天我会长大的，等将来你要是再捉住了我，我就能派上些用场了。”但是渔夫回答：“哦，不，既然已经捞到了你，我还是留着你吧，要是放你回去，谁知道我还能不能再见到你！不太可能了！”





吹牛的旅行者


有一个人出国去旅行，回家后讲了许多在外国的奇闻逸事。他说到自己参加罗得岛的跳远比赛，精彩一跃，无人能够打破。“你们去罗得岛问问，每个人都会告诉你这是真的。”其中一个在场听他讲故事的人说：“你要是能跳得那样好，我们根本不需要去罗得岛求证，就暂时假设这里是罗得岛吧，准备，跳！”

训诫：行胜于言。





螃蟹母子


有一只老螃蟹对自己的儿子说：“儿子啊，你为什么要那样侧着走呢？你应该直着向前。”小螃蟹回答：“亲爱的妈妈，你给我示范一下，我跟你学习。”老螃蟹尝试了半天，结果徒劳无功，然后才意识到自己挑儿子的错是多么愚蠢。

训诫：身教胜于言传。





驴和他的影子


夏天，有一个人租了一头驴出门旅行，驴的主人在后面负责赶驴。路上，由于天气炎热，他们时不时地停下来休息。旅行者想要躺到驴的影子里面乘凉，但是驴的主人也希望能够躲开炽热的阳光，不想让旅行者躺，便说他只租了驴，没有租驴的影子，而旅行者则说，他既然租了驴，就能暂时全权拥有驴。他们开始争执起来，最后大打出手，而就在他们俩纠缠的时候，驴撒开蹄子跑不见了。





农夫和儿子们


有一个农夫，马上就要死了，他想把一个非常重要的秘密告诉儿子们，于是把他们叫到了身边，说：“儿子们，我将不久于人世。所以，我想告诉你们，在我的葡萄园里隐藏着一个宝藏。去挖吧，你们会找到的。”父亲一死，儿子们就拿起铁锹、耙子，把葡萄园中的地翻了一遍又一遍，希望能找到埋宝之地，但却徒劳无功。不过，经过如此的深挖细作，园子里的葡萄长得前所未有的好，取得了大丰收。





狗和厨师


有一个有钱人，有一次他邀请了一伙朋友来家里赴宴。他的狗觉得可以趁此良机邀请另一只狗来，于是他去了朋友那里，说：“我的主人要办宴会，会有很多好吃的，所以你今晚上过来跟我一起吃饭吧。”于是，那只狗应邀而来，当他看到厨房里面准备的佳肴的时候，他自言自语地说：“天啊，我可真是幸运！我今天可得好好吃上一顿，将来两三天都不用吃东西才好。”他欢快地摇着尾巴，向朋友显示自己受到邀请有多高兴。但这时，厨子看到厨房里面出现了一只陌生的狗而大为光火，于是拎起这只狗的后腿，将他丢到了窗户外面。狗被摔得很惨，爬起来后便哀嚎着，一瘸一拐地走了。没过多久，其他的狗看到了他，问：“你好啊，你去参加的晚宴怎么样啊？”他回答说：“哎呀，可愉快了，美酒佳肴啊，我喝多了，都不记得自己是怎么出的屋了！”

训诫：尽量避免接受借花献佛的恩惠。





猴子做王


有一回百兽集会，猴子手舞足蹈，讨得了大家的欢心，于是便被推举为王。而狐狸对此非常不满。有一天，他发现了一个圈套，圈套中有一片肉，便带着猴子去了那里，对他说：“陛下，这是我发现的佳肴，不敢独享，因为我想只有您才配享用。您愿意接受吗？”猴子立刻便扑向了肉，结果却被圈套套住。他严厉地责备狐狸让他陷入了危险，但是狐狸只是大笑着说：“啊，猴子啊，你自称为百兽之王，居然还没聪明到能躲开这种圈套！”





贼和公鸡


有一伙贼闯入一个房子，却发现只有一只公鸡值得偷，于是便偷走了。做晚饭的时候，一个贼抓住公鸡，想要扭断他的脖子，公鸡大喊着求饶：“求求你们不要杀我，你们会发现我是最有用的鸡的，每天早晨，我都用自己的鸣叫唤醒诚实的人去工作。”而贼兴奋地回答说：“是啊，我了解你做的事情，你让我们这样的人谋生更难了。你还是下锅里去吧！”





农夫和幸运女神


一天，一个农夫在自家农场耕地，耕犁碰到了一大罐金币，这一发现让他喜不自胜，从此之后每天都去大地女神的圣坛献祭。幸运女神对此十分不高兴，于是便找到农夫，说：“喂，你为什么认为财宝是大地给你的？那明明是我给你的。你从来都没想过要感谢我赐予你好运，而当你不走运失去了自己拥有的东西时，会立刻把责任推到我身上。”

训诫：当知恩从何来再报。





朱庇特和猴子


朱庇特向所有野兽宣布，如果谁能生出他认为最美丽的后代，就给一份奖赏。猴子也在兽群当中，她抱在怀里的小猴子身上还没长毛，鼻子塌塌的，十分难看。诸神看到之后，哄堂大笑，但是猴子却把孩子抱紧，说道：“只要朱庇特喜欢他就会给奖赏，而我一直都认为我的宝宝是最美丽的呢。”





父与子


有一个人，他有好几个儿子，他们总是互相争吵，他用尽各种办法，也无法让他们和谐相处。所以他决定让他们认识到他们的愚蠢。他让他们取来一捆棍子，然后让每人顶着膝盖折断。所有人都试了，所有人都失败了，然后他把捆绳解开，给了每人一根棍子，他们都毫不费力地折断了。“看，儿子们，”父亲说，“团结起来，你们就能胜过对手；分崩离析，你们就得依靠对手的怜悯了。”

训诫：团结就是力量。





灯


灯里面装满了灯油，释放着干净而稳定的光芒，他开始志得意满，骄傲地说自己比太阳都明亮得多。就在这时，刮来了一阵风，把他给吹灭了。有人划了一根火柴，将灯再度点燃，说：“你就一直发光吧，别想着太阳了。唉，就算是星星，也不需要像你一样被重新点燃啊。”





猫头鹰和其他鸟


猫头鹰是一种非常聪明的鸟，很久之前，当森林中第一棵橡树刚开始萌芽的时候，猫头鹰将其他鸟都召集过来，对他们说：“你们看到这棵小树了吗？如果你们愿意接受我的建议，那么就趁现在它还小的时候毁掉它，因为它会长大，而槲寄生会出现在树上，槲寄生能提炼出黏鸟胶，到时候就是你们毁灭的时候了。”第一株麻被种下的时候，猫头鹰对其他鸟说：“去把那种子吃掉，那是麻的种子，人类会用麻编成罗网来抓捕你们。”还有一次，猫头鹰看到了第一个弓箭手，便警告其他鸟那是他们的死敌，他会用鸟羽装饰箭支，然后再射向鸟类。但是鸟儿们都没有听从猫头鹰的忠告，实际上，大家都认为她疯了，还嘲笑她。但是当事情的发展果然同她的预言一样时，他们便改变了看法，开始非常佩服猫头鹰的智慧。从此，无论何时，只要猫头鹰出现，百鸟便聚集在她身边，希望能够听到一些对他们有好处的事情，但是猫头鹰却不再给他们建议，只是悠闲地栖息在枝头，心里思索着鸟类的愚蠢。





披着狮子皮的驴


有一头驴捡到了一张狮子皮，就披在了身上。他四处吓唬别人，别人都把他当成了狮子，人类和百兽都没有看出来，看到他过来，就都吓得不敢动了。把戏成功，他兴高采烈，得意扬扬地大声叫唤。狐狸听到了，立刻就认出来这是一头驴，便对他说：“噢噢，我的朋友啊，是你啊，是不是？要不是听到你的声音，我也该被吓坏了。”





猫头鹰和其他鸟





母山羊的胡须


应母山羊的要求，朱庇特让她们长了胡须，而公山羊认为这是对他们权力和尊严的无礼侵犯。于是他们派出一个使团前去找朱庇特抗议。而朱庇特却建议他们不要反对。“那一丛毛有什么用？如果她们想要，就让她们要吧。在力量上，她们永远都无法和你们匹敌。”





老狮子


有一只狮子，年老体衰，再也没有办法依靠力量去捕猎获得食物，于是便决定依靠狡诈来填饱肚子。他来到一个洞穴，躺在里面，假装生病了，如果有其他动物过来问候他，他便一跃而起，扑过去将他们吞下。大部分动物都因此丧生。有一天，一只狐狸来到山洞，问他身体怎样了。他说自己很不好。“你为什么站在外面呢？请你进来吧。”“我可能已经进去了，”狐狸回答，“如果我没有看到所有的脚印都是向着山洞的，却没有出来的。”





披着狮子皮的驴





男孩洗澡


有一个男孩在河里洗澡，不小心走到了河深处，眼看就要被淹死了。一个男人经过，听到了他的求救声，到了河边，便开始指责他怎么如此不小心，走到了深水处，但却没有尝试去救那男孩。男孩喊道：“哎呀，先生，你先把我救上去再骂也不迟啊。”

训诫：紧急情况下提供援手，而不要只提供意见。





青蛙医生


从前有一只青蛙，他离开在沼泽中的家，向众人宣布，他是个精通医术的医生，擅长用药，包治百病。有只狐狸大声喊道：“你，医生？哎呀，你连自己那瘸腿和起皱的皮都治不好，怎么还能治好别人的病呢？”

训诫：医人者，先自医。





青蛙医生





吃撑的狐狸


有一只饥饿的狐狸在一棵树的树洞中找到了很多面包和肉，那是牧羊人留在那里的。狐狸十分欣喜，便爬进狭窄的洞，贪婪地将食物一扫而光。但是当他想要出去的时候，却发现自己吃得太多了，身体膨胀出不去了，于是便落回洞底，阵阵哀叹自己的不幸。另一只狐狸碰巧经过，问他是怎么回事，搞清楚事情始末之后，他说：“好吧，朋友，我想不出什么别的法子，你只能待在里面，等到你变回原来的身材，然后就能轻松出来了。”





老鼠、青蛙和鹰


有一只老鼠和一只青蛙成了好朋友，但是他们并不常在一起，因为老鼠完全生活在陆地上，而青蛙是两栖动物，有时候在陆地上安家，有时候居住在水中。为了能够一直在一起，青蛙用一根绳子将自己和老鼠的腿绑在了一起。他们在陆地上时，一切都非常好，而到了池塘边缘的时候，青蛙一跃而入，老鼠被他带下了水。青蛙在水中游来游去，高兴地呱呱叫，而可怜的老鼠很快便被淹死了，漂在水面上，被青蛙拖着。这时，一只鹰看到了老鼠，俯冲下来，将老鼠抓在爪子中。而青蛙却没有办法松开绑住他和老鼠的绳结，于是也被鹰抓走吃掉了。





男孩和荨麻


一个男孩在树篱中采野莓，他的手被一丛荨麻刺到了。他忍着伤痛，跑回家抽抽搭搭地告诉妈妈：“我不过是轻轻碰了它一下而已，妈妈。”“所以你才会被刺到，儿子，”她说，“如果你牢牢抓住，它就不会伤到你了。”





农夫和苹果树


有一个农夫的果园里有一棵苹果树，不结果子，只能让麻雀和蚂蚱躲躲阴凉，让他们坐在他的树枝上唱歌。因为果树不长果子，农夫很失望，便决定将他砍倒，于是便去取了斧子。麻雀们和蚂蚱们看到了，便恳求他不要砍树：“如果你把树砍了，我们就要去别的地方寻找阴凉了，到时候你在果园中劳作的时候就再也听不到我们歌唱了。”但是农夫没有听他们的建议，开始了砍树的工作。砍了几下之后，他发现树其实已经空了，里面有一大窝蜜蜂和很多蜂蜜。他十分惊喜，将斧头扔到一边，说：“看样子这棵老树还是值得留着的。”

训诫：有用才是财富。





寒鸦和鸽子


有一只寒鸦看到一户农家宅院中的鸽子被喂养得很好，嫉妒不已，决定自己也假装成鸽子混进去分一杯羹。于是他把自己从头到脚都染成了白色，混入了鸽群。但有一天，他疏忽了，叫出了声，立刻被识破了伪装，鸽子们毫不留情地啄他。最后他逃脱了，很开心，回到了自己的同类中。但是他浑身还是白色，其他的寒鸦没有认出他来，不让他和他们一起吃东西，要把他赶走。他枉费了诸多力气，最后却成了一个无家可归的流浪者。





朱庇特和乌龟


朱庇特打算娶妻，决定邀请所有的动物来赴宴庆祝。所有的动物都来了，只有乌龟没有到场，这令朱庇特很吃惊。后来，他见到了乌龟，便问他为什么没来参加宴会。乌龟回答：“我不喜欢出去，哪里都比不上家里好。”对此，朱庇特非常生气，于是便下令，从此以后，乌龟需要时刻背负着自己的房子，即便他想离家出门，也无法摆脱。





躺在食槽里的狗


有一只狗躺在食槽里的干草上，那草本来是给牲口们吃的，牲口们想过来吃，狗就咆哮嘶吼，不让他们得到食物。“真是个自私的畜生，”有头牲口说，“他自己吃不了，还不让我们能吃的吃。”





两个袋子


每个人身上都带着两个袋子，一个在前，一个在后，其中装满了错误。前面的袋子装的是邻人的错，后面的袋子装的是自己的错。所以，人从来都看不到自己的错，却从来不放过他人的错。





躺在食槽里的狗





公牛和车轴


有两头公牛，拉着一辆负重很重的车走在大路上，他们用力拉扯着车轭，而车轴吱嘎作响，牢骚不停。公牛觉得吵死了，便扭头愤怒地说：“嘿，说你呢！力气全是我们花的，你为什么要发出这么大动静来？”

训诫：用力最少的人抱怨最多。





男孩和榛子


一个男孩把手探入一个装了榛子的罐子中，抓了一大把，但他想把手拿出来的时候，却出不来了。因为罐子颈很窄，没有办法让抓满榛子的手出来。他又不愿意放弃手中的坚果，没有办法把手拿出来，急得都哭了。有一个路人经过，看到了问题所在，对他说：“孩子，别那么贪婪，抓半把就要知足，你还能不费力气地出来。”

训诫：不要一次贪图太多。





青蛙求国王


从前，青蛙们发现自己的族群没有统治者，很不满，于是他们便派了一个使团去见朱庇特，让他给他们一个国王。朱庇特很看不起他们的愚蠢要求，于是投了一根木头到青蛙生活的池塘，说那便是他们的国王。青蛙起初被木头溅起的水花吓了一跳，都躲进了池塘深处。但过了一会儿，他们看到木头一动不动，便一个个地回到了水面上。他们胆子越来越大，很快便看不起那木头，甚至坐到了木头上。他们觉得这样的国王是对他们尊严的侮辱，便又去见朱庇特，求他把这没有精神的国王弄走，给他们一个更好的。他们这样纠缠不休令朱庇特很恼怒，于是他便派了一只鹳去管理青蛙，鹳一到青蛙中间，便开始用它最快的速度捕食青蛙。





橄榄树和无花果树


橄榄树嘲笑无花果树在特定季节会落叶。“你每个秋天都要落叶，一直光秃秃的，直到下个春天。而我呢，你看，常年绿色，一直繁茂。”没多久，下了一场大雪，雪在橄榄树的叶子上积了很多，压得她都弯了，最后折断了。而雪花从无花果树光秃秃的树枝间落下，无花果树丝毫没有受到影响，活了下来，迎来了一个又一个丰收。





青蛙求国王





狮子和野猪


夏日炎炎，狮子和野猪又热又渴，他们同时到了一处小泉眼处喝水，立刻便为谁应该先喝水争吵起来。争吵很快变成争斗，他们都满腔怒气，奋力攻击对方。他们停下来喘气的时候发现一块石头上落着一群秃鹫，显然正等着他们其中一个死去，好飞下来享用尸体。这场景立刻令他们清醒过来，言归于好，他们说：“与其争斗最后被秃鹫吃掉，不如我们还是做朋友比较好。”





胡桃树


有一棵胡桃树长在路边，每年都会结很多果子。路过的人都会用棍子或是石子击打他的树枝，想要把果子打下来。胡桃树为此受了很多苦，他哭诉道：“这太不公平了，那些享用我果实的人，应该奖励我，而不是这么羞辱、殴打我。”





人和狮子


有一个人和一只狮子结伴旅行，他们聊天的时候开始夸耀自己的英勇和技艺，都说自己的力量和勇气远胜对方。他们激烈地争执着，同时来到一个十字路口，那里有一个人勒死狮子的雕像。“看，”人很骄傲地说，“看看那个！不是证明我们比你们强大吗？”“别那么快下结论，朋友，”狮子说，“这只是你们的观点而已。如果让我们狮子来做塑像的话，你肯定会看到人被压在下面。”

训诫：凡事均有两面。





乌龟和鹰


有一只乌龟对自己卑微的生活很不满，他看到鸟在空中翱翔嬉戏非常嫉妒，于是乞求一只鹰教他飞行。鹰不同意，认为既然大自然没有给乌龟翅膀，那他就不应该飞行。而乌龟却百般恳求，还许诺重金答谢，坚持要学会飞行于天空的技艺。最后，老鹰终于答应尽自己所能帮助乌龟，他把乌龟抓在自己的爪子中，带着乌龟飞上了高高的天空，然后他松开了爪子，可怜的乌龟一路向下，掉到石头上摔成了碎片。





屋顶上的小羊


有一只小羊被一栋房子的茅草屋顶上生长的草和其他东西吸引，爬到了屋顶上。他站在屋顶上吃草的时候看到下面有一只狼经过，他将狼奚落了一番，因为狼没有办法上屋顶抓他。狼只是抬头向上看着他，说：“你说的我都听到了，小朋友，不过能让我受挫的可不是你，而是你所站立的屋顶。”





没有尾巴的狐狸


有一只狐狸落入了陷阱中，奋力挣扎后虽然逃脱重获自由，但却失去了尾巴。他很为自己的外表自卑，觉得生命没有了意义，除非能够劝其他的狐狸都舍掉尾巴，这样他们就不会注意到他了。所以，他召集所有狐狸来开会，建议他们都割掉尾巴：“这东西多丑啊，而且还很重，总是随身带着这么个东西多讨厌啊。”但是一只狐狸说：“朋友，就算你失去了自己的尾巴，也不用这么热衷于让我们都切掉尾巴吧。”





徒劳的寒鸦


朱庇特宣布，他要任命一个鸟类之王，召集众鸟在指定日期来见他，到时候他会挑选出最漂亮的鸟来做他们的统治者。为了呈现出最好的样子，鸟儿们成群结队地来到一条小溪边，对着水梳洗打扮，整理羽毛。寒鸦也在其中，他意识到自己的羽毛实在丑陋，肯定不会被选中，于是他等到所有的鸟都走了，把他们落下的羽毛中最花哨的收集在一起，粘在了自己身上，这样他看上去就比其他鸟都好看了。到了指定日期，鸟儿们都集合在朱庇特的宝座之前。朱庇特检阅过众鸟之后，准备选寒鸦为王，但其他的鸟对此非常不满，群起攻击这位候选的鸟王，把他伪造的羽毛都扯了下来，让他露出了本来面目。





旅行者和他的狗


有一个旅行者准备去旅行，他的狗趴在门边伸着懒腰，旅行者对狗说：“起来，你打什么哈欠？快点起来做准备，你得跟我一起出门。”而狗摇了摇尾巴，轻声说：“主人，我早就准备好了，我一直在等你呢。”





船难幸存者和大海


有一个船难的幸存者奋力挣扎后终于爬上了海滩，累得睡着了。等他醒过来的时候，便厉声责备大海用平静明媚的表面迷惑众人，等人们扬帆起航后又翻脸发怒，让船和水手都葬身其中。大海以一个女人的样子显形，回答说：“水手先生，请不要责备我，要怪就怪风吧。我本来是和大地一样又平静又安全的，但是风却狂吹猛刮，让我发怒，那可不是我的本来面目啊。”





野猪和狐狸


有一只野猪正在林子中一棵树的树干上磨牙，这时一只狐狸走了过来，看到他在做的事情，对他说：“请问你为什么要这么做呢？今天猎人又没有出来，我可看不到有什么危险啊。”野猪回答说：“你说得没错，朋友，但是遇到危险我就立刻需要用到我的獠牙，那时候可没有工夫磨牙啊。”





船难幸存者和大海





墨丘利和雕塑家


墨丘利很好奇人类怎么看待自己，于是他变身成人，来到一个雕塑家的作坊，那里有一些做好的塑像正在出售。他看到了一个朱庇特的塑像，便询问那个塑像的价钱。雕塑家说：“一个克朗。”墨丘利听了大笑，道：“才这么点？”然后他指着一个朱诺的塑像问：“这个多少钱？”“半个克朗。”“那么，那一个多少钱呢？”他指着一个自己的塑像问。雕塑家回答说：“那一个？噢，如果你买了这两个，那一个就免费送给你。”





小鹿和母鹿


有一只母鹿对自己还没有长大长壮的孩子小鹿说：“儿子，大自然给了你一副强健的身体和一对有力的犄角，我不懂你怎么这么胆小，为什么要躲着那些猎犬。”就在这时，他们听到了一阵猛烈的狗吠声，但那声音离他们还有一段距离。“你不用动，不要管我。”母鹿说着，便撒开蹄子以最快的速度逃跑了。





狐狸和狮子


有一只狐狸，过去从没有见过狮子，有一天他看到了一只，看了一眼便吓得要死。后来，他又碰到了狮子，依然非常害怕，但却没有第一次那么害怕了。到了第三次，他就一点也不害怕了，直接走过去跟狮子搭话，好像已经认识狮子一辈子那么久了一样。





老鹰和捕鹰人


有一个人抓住了一只老鹰，剪掉了老鹰翅膀上的羽毛，把他丢在了自家的鸡舍里。老鹰缩在鸡舍的一角啜泣，看上去十分绝望、伤心。过了一段时间，捕鹰的人把老鹰卖给了自己的邻居，邻居将老鹰带回家，好好养着，他的翅膀便又长好了。翅膀一复原，老鹰便飞出去抓住了一只野兔，带回家送给了自己的恩人。狐狸看到后，对老鹰说：“不要把礼物浪费在他身上！回去把东西送给最初抓住你的那个人，和他做朋友，也许下一次他就不会抓你、剪掉你的翅膀了。”





铁匠和狗


有一个铁匠，养了一只小狗。铁匠干活的时候小狗总是睡觉，可是到了饭点就会立刻清醒。有一天主人开始讨厌它的表现了，虽然和往常一样丢了根骨头给小狗，却说：“养你这么一只懒狗到底有什么用呢？我这么卖力打铁，你却卧在一边睡觉；我停下来准备吃上一口饭，你却立刻醒过来摇着尾巴来要吃的。”

训诫：不工作者活该饿死。





水塘边的雄鹿


有一只很渴的雄鹿来到一个水塘边喝水。他弯下身子，看到自己在水中的倒影，对自己头上好看的角欣赏不已，同时却非常讨厌自己细长的瘦腿。他站在那里，看着自己的倒影，就在这时，有一只狮子攻击了他，一场追逐就此展开，但是雄鹿很快便甩开了狮子，一路领先，从空地一直跑到了树林里。可他的角却被树枝给挂住了，于是最终落入了狮子的口中。他用最后一口气呐喊道：“我可真可怜啊！我讨厌自己的腿，可是它们却能够保住我的命；我夸耀自己的角，可它们却害得我没了命。”

训诫：值钱的东西往往没用。





狗和影子


有一只狗嘴里叼着一块肉从一座平板木桥上过河，这时他刚好看到了自己在水中的倒影，但是他以为那是另一只狗，嘴里也叼着一块肉，那块肉看上去是自己的肉的两倍大。所以他松开了自己的肉，然后扑向那只狗，想要把那块大肉夺过来。当然，最后他一无所获，因为那只是个影子，而他却被急流给冲走了。





墨丘利和商贩


在朱庇特造人的时候，他让墨丘利加入了一些谎言，来作为制造商人的原料。墨丘利遵命照办，挨个儿给所有的商人分配了相同的比例，牛油商、菜贩、服装商……全都处理完了。最后，他遇到了名单上的最后一个，马贩子，发现还剩下一些谎言，于是就都放到了马贩子身上。所以，所有的商贩都会或多或少地撒些谎，但是却没有像马贩子这样会撒谎。





狗和影子





老鼠和黄鼠狼


老鼠和黄鼠狼之间爆发了一场战争，老鼠伤亡惨重，很多都被黄鼠狼给吃掉了。于是他们召集成立了一个战争委员会，会上，一只老鼠发言：“我们总是失败这并不奇怪，因为我们没有将军指挥战斗和行动。”为了响应他的建议，老鼠们选举出体形最大的一批老鼠担任首领。而为了让这些将军老鼠区别于其他普通老鼠，老鼠们给他们提供了用很多草编成的厚头盔。这些将军带着老鼠去战斗，自信满满，却还是落败。老鼠们全都惊慌失措地跑向自己的洞，大家都成功逃脱，只有那些将军们，被头上的等级标志妨碍，全都没有办法进入洞中，被追捕者轻而易举逮到，成了受害者。

训诫：大者有时无当，反受其害。





孔雀和朱诺


孔雀因为自己的声音不如夜莺好听而非常不满，便去向朱诺抱怨。“夜莺的歌声令所有鸟都妒忌，而我只要一发声，就立刻沦为笑柄。”女神试图安慰他：“你的确没有动听的歌声，但你的美丽远胜其他鸟，你的脖子如祖母绿般闪耀，你多彩的尾羽缤纷琳琅，简直就是奇迹。”但是孔雀却不满意：“我这样的声音，有那么美丽又有什么用？”朱诺再开口时声音中透着严厉：“命运赐予众生各自的天赋，给了你美丽，给了鹰力量，给了夜莺歌声，每人都有各自的份额，但是你却不满意自己分得的财富。不要再抱怨了。如果满足了你现在的愿望，你很快便会生出其他不满来的。”





熊和狐狸


有一只熊总是夸耀自己富有同情心，说自己和其他动物相比有多高尚。事实上，熊的确有从来不碰死尸的传统。有一只狐狸听到他的吹嘘，笑着说：“我的朋友，我倒希望你饿了的时候，能把注意力放在死物身上，放过那些还活着的。”

训诫：伪善者只能自欺。





驴和老农民


有一个老农民坐在草地上，看着他的驴在附近吃草。突然间，他看到一队全副武装的人偷偷摸摸地靠近，于是他一跃而起，让驴驮着他尽快跑掉。“不然我们都会被敌人捉住的。”但是驴只是懒散地看了看周围，说：“如果被抓的话，你觉得他们让我驮的东西会比以前重吗？”主人回答说：“不会。”驴说：“啊，那好吧，我并不介意被他们抓住，反正我的境况也不会变得更糟。”





公牛和青蛙


有两只小青蛙在池塘边玩耍，这时一只公牛到池塘边饮水，一不小心踩到了一只青蛙身上，把他给踩死了。青蛙妈妈发现孩子不见了，问活下来的青蛙他的兄弟去了哪里。小青蛙说：“妈妈，他死了。今天早晨，一个有四条腿的庞然大物来我们池塘，把他踩到了烂泥里。”“庞然大物？他有这么大吗？”青蛙妈妈说着把自己的身体鼓起来，鼓到尽量大。结果得到的回答是：“比这可大多了。”青蛙妈妈又让自己鼓胀了一些。“他有这么大吗？”她问。“哦！有的，有的，妈妈，比这大多了！”小青蛙回答。青蛙妈妈一次次地让自己鼓胀起来，直到她圆得像个球一样。“有这么大……”她开口问道，然后她便爆裂了。





人和神像


有一个穷人，他有一尊木头神像，他每天都向神像祈祷，希望自己能富裕起来。他坚持了很长一段时间，可是依然一贫如洗，有一天，他恼恨地抓起神像，用尽力气砸向了墙壁。这一下猛击，将神像的头给砸开了，很多金币从里面滚出来落在地板上。那人贪婪地将金币收集起来，说：“哎呀，你这个老骗子！我敬你的时候，你什么好处都不给我，可是我一以羞辱、暴力待你，你便让我做了有钱人。”





公牛和青蛙





赫拉克勒斯和车夫


有一个车夫赶着马车，走在一条泥泞的路上，车上拉着沉重的货物，不巧他的马车车轮陷在了泥潭里，马怎么都拉不动。他站在那里，茫然无助，不时大声呼唤赫拉克勒斯来帮忙。大力神显灵出现在他面前，他说：“伙计，把你的肩膀顶在车轮上，赶起你的马，然后你就可以让赫拉克勒斯帮忙了。如果你自己连根手指都不愿抬，那不可能让赫拉克勒斯或其他任何人来帮你的忙。”

训诫：自助者，天助之。





石榴树、苹果树和荆棘


有一棵石榴树和一棵苹果树争论他们谁的产量更高，他们都说自己更高产。他们你来我往，滔滔不绝，一场激烈的争吵即将发生。这时一株荆棘从旁边的树丛中探出头来，说：“唉唉，朋友们，够了吧，咱们还是别吵了吧。”





狮子、熊和狐狸


狮子和熊同时抓到了一只小羊，为了争夺所有权，便发生了争斗。他们的战斗漫长而激烈，到最后双方都精疲力竭，伤痕累累地躺在地上，喘着粗气。有一只狐狸一直在旁边徘徊，观察着这场战斗，当他看到狮子和熊都躺在地上，虚弱得动不了时，便偷偷摸过去，抓住小羊跑掉了。狮子和熊无助地看着，却也没有办法，其中一个说：“我们一直在这儿厮杀，结果只有狐狸得到了好处！”





黑人


有一个人曾经买了一个埃塞俄比亚的奴隶，那奴隶像所有的埃塞俄比亚人一样皮肤黑黑的，但是奴隶的主人觉得他皮肤黑，是因为上一个主人对他不关心，他只要洗个澡就能变得白白的了。所以他提供了大量的热水和肥皂，给奴隶又搓又擦，结果却徒劳无功，奴隶的皮肤依然像从前一样黑，而这可怜的奴隶还因此着了凉，没过多久就死掉了。





两个士兵和劫匪


有两个士兵结伴旅行，路上遇到了劫匪。一个士兵撒腿就跑，但是另一个站在原地，拔出自己的剑，英姿勃发地指着劫匪，劫匪不得不逃走。等事情平息之后，那个胆小鬼回来了，挥动着自己的武器，口里说着威胁的话语：“他在哪儿？让我来对付他，我很快就能让他见识到他要打劫的是谁！”但另一个士兵回答说：“太晚了，我的朋友，我真希望刚才你能够支持我，哪怕只是动动嘴而已，那样我也会受到鼓励，相信你说的话是真的。而现在，你还是安静下来，把剑收起来吧，这已经没有什么用了。你也许能让别人以为你像狮子一样勇敢，但是我知道，一遇到危险，你会像兔子一样逃命。”





狮子和野驴


狮子和野驴一起去打猎，野驴依靠自己的速度追逐猎物并将其撞倒，而狮子在后面跟上，将猎物击败。他们收获颇丰，到了分配成果的时候，狮子将猎物分成了三等份。“我要拿走第一份，因为我是百兽之王。我也要拿走第二份，因为作为你的搭档，我有权得到剩下的一半。而第三份呢，你最好把它给我，然后赶快逃命，不然，相信我，你会深深遗憾的！”

训诫：能力决定权力。





黑人





人和萨梯


一个人和萨梯成了朋友，他们住到了一起，一切都很好，直到一个冬天，萨梯看到人正对着手哈气，于是便问：“你为什么这么做？”“暖手。”人回答。当天吃晚饭的时候，他们各自有一大碗热粥，人把碗端到了嘴边，吹着气。“你为什么这么做？”萨梯问。“把粥吹凉。”人回答。萨梯起身离席。“再见了，我要走了。我可没有办法和既能吹热气又能吹冷气的人做朋友。”





卖神像的人


有一个人做了一个木头的墨丘利神像，带到市场上去卖，可是没有人买。他想，如果能够宣传一下这尊神像的好处，应该就能吸引来购买者了。所以，他在市场中来来回回地走着喊道：“卖神像啦！卖神像啦！可以给你带来好运，可以帮你守住好运！”立刻就有一个看热闹的人拦住他问：“要是你的神像如你说的那样，你怎么不留着他，给你自己谋到最大好处呢？”“是这样的，”那人回答说，“他的确能够带来益处，但却需要时间，而我现在就需要用钱。”





人和萨梯





鹰和箭


一只鹰落在高耸的山岩上，目光烁烁地寻找着猎物。一个猎人潜伏在山缝中，也在寻找目标。他看到鹰，便引弓发箭，箭直接射入鹰的胸膛，穿透了他的身体。鹰奄奄一息，痛苦地躺在地上，目光落在了箭上。“唉！命运可真残酷！”他叫道，“我要死于此了！啊！居然还有更惨的，射杀我的箭的箭羽是鹰的羽毛啊！”





富人和制革人


有一个富人和一个制革人比邻而居，他觉得制革厂的气味很难闻，于是便让制革人搬家。制革人总是拖着，富人不得不跟他说了好几次，每一次，制革人都说自己很快就会搬走。如是几次，到了最后，富人已经习惯了那味道，不再在意了，也便不再去打扰制革人了。





狼、母亲和孩子


一只饿狼四处寻找食物。后来，他听到了孩子的哭声，便顺着哭声来到了一栋村舍。他潜伏在窗下，听到母亲对孩子说：“不要哭了，不要哭了！再哭我就把你丢去喂狼。”狼以为她是当真的，便等了很长时间，期待能够填饱自己的肚皮。一直到了晚上，他听到母亲哄孩子说：“如果恶狼过来，是吃不到我的小宝贝的，爸爸会杀死大恶狼。”狼无比恼怒地起身走了，边走边自言自语：“住在那屋子里的人，说的话一个字都不能相信。”





老妇人和酒坛


有一个老妇人捡到了一个空酒坛，这酒坛曾经装过一种很稀有很值钱的酒，现在里面还保留着独特的酒香。老妇人把酒坛举到鼻子边，闻了一遍又一遍。“哎呀，能留下这么美好的味道的液体，该是多么美味啊！”





母狮子和母狐狸


有一只母狮子和一只母狐狸相遇，她们谈起了自己的孩子。两个母亲一致夸耀自己的孩子长得多好、多健康，皮毛有多好，简直就是父母的翻版。“我最小的崽子让人看了就喜欢。”母狐狸说，然后她又恶毒地补充说，“我发现你从来都只能生一个，没有多的时候。”母狮子坚定地说：“是只有一个，不过那是一只狮子。”

训诫：重质，不要重量。





毒蛇和锉刀


有一条毒蛇进入了一个木匠的店铺，在各种工具中爬来爬去，求他们给他些东西吃。他对一把锉刀说，希望能够尝尝饭的美味。锉刀以一种怜悯而轻蔑的语气回答：“你可真是个傻瓜，居然觉得能从我这儿找到东西，要知道我可是从其他所有人那儿拿东西，从来都不回报的。”

训诫：贪婪者往往吝啬。





猫和公鸡


有一只猫扑向一只公鸡，将其捉住，然后想找个好借口把鸡吃掉，因为猫惯常是不吃公鸡的，她知道自己不应该吃鸡。最后，她说：“你很讨厌，每天晚上打鸣，把人们吵醒，所以我要结果了你。”但是公鸡为自己辩护说他打鸣是为了把人们叫醒，让人们能及时准备工作，没有他，人们真的不会过得很好。“也许吧，”猫说，“管他们能不能呢，我的晚饭反正不能缺了你。”

训诫：没有好借口，也不能阻止恶人作恶。





龟兔赛跑


有一天，一只兔子嘲笑乌龟走路速度慢。“等等，”乌龟说，“我要跟你比赛，我打赌我能赢。”“啊，好啊！”兔子回答，他觉得这主意实在很可笑，“咱们比比看。”他们达成协议，由狐狸为他们设定比赛规则，担任裁判。比赛开始，龟兔两个同时出发，但是兔子很快就领先了，他觉得自己可以休息一下，于是便躺在路边睡着了。而乌龟却一直缓缓前行，及时到达了终点。等到兔子猛地惊醒，以最快的速度飞奔到终点，却发现乌龟早就赢得了比赛。

训诫：稳扎稳打，坚持不懈才能胜利。





士兵与马


战争时期，一个士兵给自己的马吃大量的燕麦，照顾也十分用心，他希望马能够身体强壮，忍受住战场上的艰难困境，驮着他轻松奔腾，需要的时候，带着他脱离危险。但战争结束后，他开始让马做各种苦工，却很少关注它了，给它的食物也只有干草而已。战争再次爆发，士兵又给马套上马鞍和缰绳，他披上铠甲，跨上马奔赴战场。可那可怜的马早已经饿得半死，他一上马，马的身子便塌下来，马对主人说：“这次你得走着去战场了。繁重的劳动和糟糕的食物把我从一匹马变成了一头驴，你可没有办法让我立刻变回马。”





公牛和屠夫


从前，有一群公牛决定报复给他们的种群带来浩劫的屠夫，计划在某一天将所有的屠夫都杀死。他们聚在一起，想讨论出一个最佳的计划。性子狂暴的公牛都开始磨砺自己的犄角了。这时一头老公牛站出来说：“兄弟们，我知道，你们恨屠夫是有正当且充分的理由的，但是，不管怎么说，他们熟悉自己的行当，从来都不会引起我们不必要的痛苦。但如果我们把他们给杀了，之后再来杀我们的就是那些没有经验的人，他们会笨手笨脚，给我们带来很多痛苦。你们肯定明白，即便屠夫都死了，人类也不可能放弃吃牛肉。”





狼和狮子


有一只狼从羊群中偷到了一只小羊，想把他拖到远处去大快朵颐。路上，他碰到了狮子，结果狮子夺走他的猎物跑了。狼不敢反抗，可是等狮子走远一些后，他说：“你这样强抢我的东西可不公平！”狮子听了哈哈笑着回答：“这是你的，没错！是不是你朋友送你的，嗯？”





羊、狼和雄鹿


有一只雄鹿要向羊借一些麦子，说他的朋友狼可以做担保人。羊害怕他们合伙骗她，所以便拒绝道：“狼总是抢了他想要的东西就跑，从来都不会偿还，而你呢，也跑得比我快。所以，债务到期后，我怎么可能追上你们讨债呢？”

训诫：积非不能成是。





狮子和三头公牛


有三头公牛在草地上吃草，狮子看到了，很想去把他们抓住吃掉，但是又觉得自己一个人没有办法对付三头在一起的公牛。所以，他说各种谎话，并做出各种邪恶的暗示，想要激起公牛彼此之间的嫉妒和敌意。这一策略非常成功，没多久，公牛之间就变得很冷漠，不友好，最后便彼此躲避，各自去吃草。狮子一看到这种局面，便将公牛一头接一头地杀掉了。

训诫：朋友之间争吵，只会给仇敌良机。





马和骑手


一个年轻人总以为自己是个了不起的骑手，有一天他骑上了一匹马，那匹马并没有被好好地训练过，很难驾驭。马一感受到骑手的重量，就猛冲出去，怎么也拦不住。骑手的一个朋友看到他一直朝前冲，就喊道：“你这么着急是去哪儿啊？”骑手指着马，回答说：“我不知道。你问他。”





羊和葡萄藤


一只羊迷路走进了葡萄园，然后便开始吃葡萄藤上的嫩叶，那藤上有好几串葡萄。葡萄藤问：“我到底做错了什么，你为何要如此伤害我？难道你没有足够的草吃吗？尽管如此，即便你吃光了我所有的叶子，让我光秃秃的，我也会产出足够的葡萄，酿出足够的酒，当你躺在祭坛上做祭品时浇在你身上。”





两个罐子


有两个罐子，一个是陶的，一个是黄铜的，发洪水的时候，他们被水流冲到了河下游。黄铜罐子要求同伴紧紧跟在他身边，说他会保护他的。另一个罐子表示感谢，却恳求他无论如何不要接近自己。“因为那正是我害怕的。只要碰到你，我就会四分五裂。”

训诫：彼此平等才能成为良友。





羊和葡萄藤





两个罐子





老猎犬


有一只猎犬为主人服务多年，帮助他追获了许多猎物，现在开始年老体衰，速度也没有那么快了。有一天，外出打猎的时候，主人惊起了一头很有力量的野猪，便派出猎犬去追。猎犬咬了野猪的耳朵，但是他的牙都已经掉光了，根本咬不住，所以野猪逃脱了。主人厉声责骂猎犬，猎犬打断他说：“我的意志一如既往的坚强，但是主人，我的身体已经老病衰弱。你应该因为我过去做过的事情尊重我，而不是因为我现在的样子来侮辱我。”





小丑和乡下人


有一个贵族宣布说要在剧院举办一场公共娱乐活动，对于有新奇异能、想要在其中表演亮相的人都会给予优厚报酬。这一启事吸引了很多魔术师、杂耍艺人、杂技演员，其中还有一个很受人欢迎的小丑，他说要在表演时拿出一个全新的节目来。到了那天，表演还没开始，剧院里里外外就挤满了人。有好多表演者都演出了自己的节目，然后最受欢迎的那位小丑两手空空、独自一人出现在舞台上。观众们立刻鸦雀无声，满怀期待。他把头低垂到胸口，模仿小猪叫的声音，他的模仿十分精彩，所以观众们都认为他身上偷偷藏了一头小猪，让他快点把小猪拿出来。但是他说服观众自己并没有带猪，一时间掌声雷动。在观众当中，有一个乡下人，他觉得小丑的表演没有什么好的，宣称自己明天会表演更加精彩的节目。第二天，剧院又挤满了人，小丑又表演了模仿节目，赢得了观众的欢呼。乡下人在上台前在自己的衣服下面藏了一头小猪，观众们开始嘲笑他，他就揪了一下小猪的耳朵，让它大声叫了起来。但是观众们众口一词地说小丑的模仿更加逼真。于是，乡下人把小猪从衣服底下拿出来，挖苦地说：“看，你们到底是什么样的裁判啊！”





百灵鸟和农夫


百灵鸟在一片玉米地里面筑巢栖息，她把雏鸟藏在成熟的谷物下面，小鸟的翅膀还没有长好。有一天农民过来检查庄稼，看到穗子都黄了，便说：“我得尽快叫邻居过来帮忙收庄稼了。”其中一只小鸟听到了他的话恐惧不已，便问妈妈他们是否应该立刻搬家。“不用着急，”百灵鸟说，“一个总是找人来帮忙的人，根本不会把自己的时间当回事。”过了几天，那农夫又来了，看到庄稼已经熟透了，有的粮食都从穗子中脱落掉到了地上。他说：“我真是不能再拖了，今天我就雇人让他们立刻开始工作。”百灵鸟听到他的话，对孩子们说：“来吧，孩子们，我们必须得走了，他已经不再说朋友了，而是自己来处理事情了。”

训诫：自助是最好的帮助。





狮子和驴


狮子和驴组成搭档一起去打猎，有一天，他们到了一处山洞，那里住着一些野山羊。狮子在山洞口站定，等着野山羊出来。而驴走进去，大声嗷嗷叫着，要把野山羊赶出山洞。野山羊一出来，狮子便将他们一只接一只地扑倒。山洞空了之后，驴出来了，说：“看，我把他们吓坏了，是不是？”“的确是，”狮子说，“哎呀，我要不是知道你是驴，也早掉头跑了。”





先知


一个先知坐在集市当中，给那些愿意光顾的人算命。突然间，有一个人跑过来告诉他他家进了贼，把能拿的都拿走了。先知一下子站起来，匆匆地往家跑，一边跑一边扯着头发，大声詈骂那些贼。路人全都笑了，其中一个说：“我们的朋友知道别人的命运，但看上去却不能预知自己的命运。”





猎犬和野兔


有一只小猎犬追捕一只兔子，他抓住她的时候，忽而猛地一口咬住，似乎要把她杀了一般，忽而又松开爪牙，围着她打转，好像在和另一只小狗玩耍一样。最后，野兔说：“我希望你能露出本来面目！如果你是我的朋友，为什么要咬我？如果你是我的敌人，你又为什么跟我玩耍？”

训诫：两面派并不是朋友。





狮子、老鼠和狐狸


有一只狮子躺在自己的洞穴口睡觉，一只老鼠爬到他的背上，搔他的痒痒，狮子猛地惊醒，四处寻找是谁打扰了他的好梦。一只看到事情经过的狐狸觉得自己要笑话一下狮子，他说：“哎呀，这还是我第一次看到狮子害怕老鼠呢。”“怕老鼠？”狮子暴躁地说，“才不！我是受不了他的无礼。”





被俘的吹号手


有一个吹号手参加战斗，站在队伍的前列，用自己激昂的曲调鼓励战友们。但他不幸被敌人俘虏，他祈求敌人饶了他的命，说：“别杀我，我一个人都没有杀过，我都没有武器，只是带着我的号而已。”但是俘虏他的人说：“因此我们才更应该要了你的命，你自己不战斗，却煽动别人去。”





狼和鹤


有一只狼喉咙里面卡了一根骨头，便去找鹤，求她把长长的喙伸进他的喉咙里帮他把骨头拔出来。“我会报答你的。”他说。鹤照办了，轻而易举就把骨头拔了出来。狼很热情地道谢，然后转身就走，鹤叫道：“我的酬劳呢？”“呃，什么？”狼厉声说着，露出了牙齿，“你可以去吹嘘说你把头伸进了狼嘴里却毫发无伤没有被咬，你还想要什么？”





狼和鹤





鹰、猫和母野猪


有一只鹰把巢筑在一棵高高的树上，一只猫和家人住在树干中部的一个树洞里，而一头母野猪带着幼崽住在树下。他们本来是很好的邻居，只是猫却施行了诡计。她爬到鹰巢，对鹰说：“我们处于极大的危险中。那头可怕的母野猪，我总是看到她在树根那里挖土，她想要把树拔起来，那母野猪可能是想把你们一家和我们一家都吃掉。”这番话把鹰给吓得快疯了。猫又顺着树爬了下去，对母野猪说：“我必须得提醒你留心那只恐怖的鸟，那只老鹰。你带小猪崽出来的时候，她总是寻找俯冲下来的机会，好把你的小猪抓走，去喂她的孩子。”猫成功地激起了母野猪的恐惧。然后她回到自己的洞中，假装也非常害怕，白天都不出来，只在晚上偷溜出来给孩子觅食。而老鹰怕得不敢离巢，母野猪也不敢出门，这两家人便都慢慢饿死了，而他们的尸体却成了猫一家的食物。





狼和羊


狼被狗咬成重伤，很害怕很担心，躺了很长时间，一心等死。但是最后他苏醒了，感到很饿，便对一只路过的羊说：“你能好心到附近的小溪给我打点水来喝吗？只要能喝点水，我就能自己去找肉吃了。”但是羊可不是傻瓜，他说：“我很清楚，如果我给你打来了水，你要找肉简直轻而易举。祝你开心。再见。”





金枪鱼和海豚


金枪鱼被一只海豚追逐，噼里啪啦地飞速滑水向前，但海豚还是慢慢地追了上来，就要抓住金枪鱼了，但是他的巨大冲击力令金枪鱼冲到了沙滩上。一心要追上金枪鱼的海豚紧随其后，他们两个都搁浅了，奄奄一息。金枪鱼看到自己的敌人落得和自己同样的下场，说：“我并不介意这样死去，因为我看到了给我带来死亡的人承受了同样的命运。”





三个工匠


有一个城市要建筑护卫城市安全的防御工事，人们纷纷争论用什么材料最好。一个木匠站起来，提议用木头，他说木头容易获取，容易使用。一个石匠反对用木头，因为木头容易起火，推荐用石头代替。而皮革工人站起来说：“在我看来，什么东西都比不上皮革。”

训诫：人人为己。





老鼠和公牛


有一只公牛的鼻子被老鼠咬了，他追着老鼠不放，但老鼠动作灵敏，溜进了墙上的一个洞中。公牛狂怒，一次次地撞击那堵墙，直到筋疲力尽，瘫倒在地上。一切平静之后，老鼠又出来了，又咬了他。公牛愤怒得发狂了，他站起来，但是老鼠又躲进了洞里，公牛除了因无助而愤怒地咆哮之外，什么都做不了。过了一会儿，他听到一个尖细的小声音从墙里面传出来：“你这个大家伙也不能总是为所欲为，有时候我们小家伙更能来去自如。”

训诫：并非强者就能获胜。





野兔和猎犬


一只猎犬将一只兔子从洞中惊出来，追了一段时间，但是兔子和他渐渐拉开了距离，猎犬放弃了。一个看到这场追逐的农夫看到猎犬回来了，便嘲笑他的失败：“那小东西比你厉害多啦。”“啊，哎呀，”猎犬说，“你得记住，跑去吃饭是一种速度，而跑着逃命会是另一种速度。”





城里的老鼠和乡下的老鼠


有一只城里的老鼠和一只乡下的老鼠是朋友。有一天，乡下的老鼠邀请朋友来自己在田野中的家做客。城里的老鼠来到后，乡下老鼠以大麦粒和植物根来款待客人。植物根透着一种明显的泥土的气息，城里老鼠并不太喜欢这种口味，吃了没多久，他便开口：“我可怜的朋友，你过得比蚂蚁还不如。你去看看我吃的是什么吧！我的储藏室里面满是珍馐美味，你一定得和我一起回家，我保证你会养尊处优的。”他回城的时候，便带着乡下老鼠和他一起，他给乡下老鼠展示那装满了面粉、燕麦、无花果、蜂蜜和蜜枣的储藏室。乡下老鼠从来都没有见过这些东西，便坐下来享受朋友的款待。但是他们还没开始吃，储藏室的门便开了，有人走了进来。两只老鼠立刻落荒而逃，藏身到一个狭小而不舒服的洞里。过了一会儿，一切安静下来，他们又出去继续吃，但是很快又有人来了，他们再次落荒而逃。乡下老鼠实在受不了了，说：“再见，我要走了。你是生活得很奢侈，我都看到了，但是你被危险包围着，而在我家，我可以安心无忧地享受根和谷物这些简单饭肴。”





狮子和公牛


一只狮子看到一群牲口在吃草，其中有一头肥肥的公牛，他便想方设法要把公牛抓来吃掉。所以，他对外称他要献祭一只羊，问公牛是否愿意与他共进晚餐。公牛接受了邀请，但是，到了狮子的洞穴，他看到了很多炖锅和烤肉叉，却没有见到羊，所以他便什么都没说，转身离开了。狮子在他身后喊他，用受伤的口气问他为什么，公牛回头说：“我理由充分。我看到你准备的东西便恍然大悟，你要杀的是一头牛，而不是一只羊。”

训诫：鸟儿若看到了罗网，罗网便没有了意义。





狼、狐狸和猿


有一只狼指控狐狸是小偷，狐狸否认，案件被送呈到了猿那里去裁决。猿听完了双方的证词之后，给出了如下裁决：“狼，我并不认为你损失了你声称损失的东西。同样，我也坚信，狐狸，你的确犯了偷窃的罪行，尽管你们全都不承认。”

训诫：不诚实的人即便表现得很诚实，也不会有人相信。





鹰和公鸡


一个农场上有两只公鸡互相争斗，想决出谁是主人。战斗结束之后，被打败的那只走了，躲藏在一个黑暗的角落里，而胜出的那只飞到了畜舍的屋顶上，神采奕奕地叫个不停。一只在天空中飞过的鹰看到了他，俯冲下来将他捉走了。另外那只公鸡立刻从角落里出来，然后成了统治者。

训诫：骄傲之后就是失势。





逃走的寒鸦


有一个人抓住了一只寒鸦，把他的腿拴在一根绳子上，让孩子牵着当宠物。寒鸦不喜欢和人一起生活，过了一段时日，他似乎是被驯服了，人们对他看得没有那么紧了，他便偷偷溜走飞回了自己昔日的巢穴。只是很不幸，那根绳子还拴在他的腿上，没多久绳子就缠在了树枝上，寒鸦用尽了办法，但还是无法自由移动。他看到自己了无希望，便绝望地哭着说：“啊呀，我重得了自由，却失去了生命！”





农场主和狐狸


有一只狐狸经常夜间潜到一个农夫的院子中偷走他的家禽，农夫因而非常恼怒，于是便设置陷阱，捉住了狐狸。为了报复狐狸，他把一团麻绑在了狐狸尾巴上，点起了火。结果坏运气降临，狐狸直接冲入了田地，地里的庄稼都已经成熟待割，很快便着了火，熊熊燃烧了起来。

训诫：复仇是一把双刃剑。





维纳斯和猫


有一只猫爱上了一个英俊的年轻人，便去祈求维纳斯将她变成一个女人。维纳斯非常和蔼可亲，她将猫变成了一个美丽的少女，那年轻人对其一见钟情，很快两个人就结婚了。一天，维纳斯想要去看看猫是否因为改变了形态而改变了习惯，于是便派出一只老鼠去了他们住的地方。一看到老鼠，那年轻女人立刻忘了一切，直接跳起来，像箭一样冲出去追老鼠。女神很讨厌她这样的表现，又将她变回了猫。





维纳斯和猫





乌鸦和天鹅


一只乌鸦看到天鹅美丽洁白的羽毛，非常嫉妒，觉得是因为天鹅经常在水中洗澡和游泳，所以才那么白。他本来一直生活在祭坛附近，以啄食祭坛上献祭的肉为生，为了变白，他离开了祭坛，去池塘和溪流边生活。尽管他一天洗好多次羽毛，但始终没有办法变白，而且最后还饿死了。

训诫：习惯可改，本性难变。





一只眼的雄鹿


有一只雄鹿瞎了一只眼，他在海滩附近吃草，一直用那只好眼对着陆地，以防有猎犬靠近，而瞎了的那只眼则对着大海，他从来都不觉得那个方向会有什么危险。结果，几个水手沿着海滩航行，看到了他，便向他射了一箭，鹿因此而受了致命伤。躺在地上奄奄一息的时候，他自言自语道：“我可真可怜！我总以为陆地上会有危险，结果那里无人攻击我，我从来没有担心过海上会有灾祸，结果我却被杀了。”

训诫：不幸往往来自我们想不到的地方。





苍蝇和骡子


一只苍蝇停在一辆运货马车的车辕上，对拉车的骡子说：“你可真慢啊！走快点！不然我就用我的刺蜇你，就像用狼牙棒打你一样。”骡子对它不屑一顾。“我后面的车上坐的才是我的主人，他手拉着缰绳，向我轻挥马鞭，对他我唯命是从，但我可不在乎你的鲁莽无礼。我知道自己什么时候能混时间，什么时候要卖命工作。”





公鸡和宝石


一只公鸡在地上刨来刨去，想找些吃的，碰巧发现了一颗丢在那里的宝石。公鸡说：“哎呀！你可真是个好东西，这是无疑的，如果你的主人找到了你，那他得多高兴啊。可是你对我来说有什么用啊！对我来说，一颗谷子比世界上所有的宝石都要重要。”





狼和牧羊人


一只狼在一个羊群附近徘徊了很长时间，却没有去骚扰他们。





公鸡和宝石



牧羊人自然将其视为祸害，起初紧紧盯着他，但过了一段时间，狼没有表现出攻击羊群的迹象，牧羊人便开始将狼当作了羊群的保护者，而不是敌人。有一天，他因为一些事情去了城里，放心地把狼留在了羊群里。但他刚一走，狼便袭击了羊群，杀死了大部分羊。牧羊人回来看到他自己造成的惨剧，哭着说：“我将羊群交托给一只狼，落得这样的下场罪有应得。”





农夫和鹳


有一个农夫，在刚刚耕种完的田地里面设置了一些陷阱，想要捉获来偷吃种子的鹤。等他来查看陷阱的时候，发现已经捉住了好几只鹤，其中有一只向他求饶，求他放了自己。“你不应该杀我，我不是鹤，而是一只鹳，你看我的羽毛，很显然，我是最诚实最无害的鸟类。”农夫说：“对我来说，你是什么并不重要，我发现你和这些破坏我的庄稼的鹤在一起，而且长得和他们很像，你就得受到惩罚。”

训诫：如果你选择与坏人为伍，没有人会相信你是好人。





战马和磨坊主


有一匹战马，曾经驮着骑手上过战场，现在觉得自己老了，便去一个磨坊干活。他现在再也无法随着战鼓的鼓点迈出骄傲的步子，不得不整天像奴隶一样研磨粮食。他为自己的不幸而哀叹，有一天他对磨坊主说：“啊呀！我曾经是一匹出色的战马，披着华丽的马甲，由马夫照顾，他唯一的职责就是满足我的需要。再看我现在的状况，简直是天壤之别。我真希望自己从来都没有离开战场来到磨坊。”磨坊主粗暴地回答说：“你这么惋惜过去可没有什么用。命运有起有落，你必须欣然接受。”





蚱蜢和猫头鹰


有一只猫头鹰，住在一棵树的树洞里，她每天晚上出来觅食，白天睡觉，但是她的睡眠受到了一只住在树枝上的蚱蜢的叫声的严重干扰。猫头鹰一次次地恳求蚱蜢为她考虑一下，但是蚱蜢却唱得更大声了。最后，猫头鹰再也忍受不了了，决定要设法除掉这只害虫。她以最令人愉快的方式对蚱蜢说：“你的歌声令我无法安睡，那对我来说就如同阿波罗的竖琴弹奏的音符一样甜美，所以我想要喝些花蜜，密涅瓦前几天刚好送了我一些。你想过来一起品尝吗？”蚱蜢听到自己的歌声受到夸赞，十分开心，而听到有美味的东西喝，他已经流出了口水，于是他说他很乐意。他一走进猫头鹰居住的树洞，猫头鹰就扑过去将他吃掉了。





蚱蜢和蚂蚁


一个晴朗的冬日，蚂蚁正忙着晾晒自己收藏的粮食，前段日子下了很长时间的雨，这些粮食都发潮了。不一会儿，走来了一只蚱蜢，她向蚂蚁乞讨，希望他们能分她一些粮食。“我都快饿死了。”她说。蚂蚁暂时停下了工作，尽管这有悖于他们的原则。他们说：“我们能问一下，你在整个夏天都在做什么吗？为什么你没有收集储备过冬的食物呢？”蚱蜢回答：“实际上，我夏天都在忙着唱歌，没有时间。”蚂蚁回答：“如果你夏天都在唱歌，那你最好用跳舞来过冬。”他们笑了一阵，便又接着干起了活。





农夫和蛇


一个冬天，一个农夫发现了一条冻僵的蛇，出于怜悯，他把蛇捡起来，放在了自己怀里。到了温暖的环境中，蛇很快便醒了过来，却恩将仇报，给了自己的救命恩人致命一咬。可怜的人摔倒在地，奄奄一息，哭喊着说：“我可真是活该啊，居然同情这种邪恶的东西。”

训诫：善心投诸恶人，完全是虚掷。





两只青蛙


两只青蛙是邻居，其中一只住在一片沼泽里，那里有大量的水（青蛙都很喜欢水），另一只住在稍远处的一条小路上，那里只有雨后的车辙里才有水。沼泽里的青蛙警告朋友，督促他快点搬来沼泽和自己一起生活，这里远比小路那边更加舒适，而且更重要的是，还更安全。但是另外那只青蛙却拒绝了，说自己不愿意离开一个已经住惯了的地方。过了一段日子，有一辆满载沉重货物的货车驶到了那条路上，那只青蛙被车轮碾死了。





改行做医生的修鞋匠


有一个技术很不好的修鞋匠，发现自己没有办法依靠修鞋为生，便不再修鞋，改行做了医生。他声称自己有一种能解百毒的解毒剂，由于他吹嘘自己的能力，赚了很多钱。但是有一天，他自己生了重病，国王觉得应该测试一下他的灵药，于是让人倒出一剂解毒剂，假装混了毒药在里面，实际上只是加了一些水，然后便命令他喝下去。修鞋匠害怕被毒死，便承认自己对医药一无所知，他的解毒剂一钱不值。然后国王召集臣民，发布演说：“还有比你们更傻的傻瓜吗？都没有人送靴子去让这个修鞋匠修，你们却还毫不犹豫地把命交托到他手里。”





驴、公鸡和狮子


有一只驴和一只公鸡一起住在畜栏里。过了一段时间，有一只饿了好几天的狮子来到这里，他要攻击驴，想把驴吃掉，公鸡便飞到最高处，猛烈地拍打翅膀，大声叫唤。而狮子唯一害怕的事情就是公鸡打鸣，他一听到公鸡的叫声便逃走了。驴兴高采烈，精神高涨，觉得狮子既然都不敢面对公鸡，那要对抗驴便更不可能。所以他跑出去追狮子。等他们两个走得远了，他们再也看不见听不见公鸡的时候，狮子便突然转身向驴发动攻击，将他吃掉了。

训诫：盲目的自信通常会导致灾祸。





肚子和四肢


有一回，四肢集体对抗肚子，他们对肚子说：“你生活奢侈，却懈怠懒散，什么活都不做，而我们却不仅要做所有困难的工作，而且实际上还是你的奴隶，得满足你的所需。我们现在不愿意再这么做了，你自己好好打算一下未来吧。”他们言出必行，便让肚子饿着。结果很明显：整个身体越来越虚弱，四肢以及其他器官都崩溃了。等他们发现自己的愚蠢的时候为时已晚。





秃子和苍蝇


有一只苍蝇落在了一个秃头男人的头上，不断地咬他。秃子想把苍蝇杀死，他狠狠打了自己一巴掌。苍蝇逃脱了，嘲弄地对他说：“你因为这么一小口就想杀死我，那现在呢，你打了自己那么重一下，你又该怎么对付你自己呢？”男人回答：“哦，对那一下我可没有什么怨恨，因为我从来都没想给我自己造成任何伤害，但是你这个卑鄙的害虫，以吸食人血为生，只要能把你赶出我的生活，我付出再多也是值得的。”





秃子和苍蝇





驴和狼


驴在草地上吃草，看到他的天敌狼就在远处，便假装自己腿瘸了，痛苦地蹒跚着。狼走过来，问驴为什么瘸了，驴说他在过树篱的时候踩到了荆棘，他求狼用牙齿帮他把刺拔出来。“这样你吃我的时候就不会卡到你的喉咙害你受伤了。”狼答应了，便让驴抬起他的脚，一心一意地要拔荆棘。驴突然间狠狠地踢了狼的嘴，踢碎了他的牙齿，然后便全速跑掉了。狼能说话之后，就嘟囔道：“我是活该啊，我父亲教会我杀戮，我就应该坚持杀戮，而不是去治疗什么。”





猴子和骆驼


在一次百兽集会上，猴子表演了舞蹈，大家都很喜欢。表演结束时掌声雷动，这激起了骆驼的嫉妒，他也想要通过相同的方法赢得大家的喜爱。所以他站起来，也开始跳舞，他全心投入，但动作滑稽古怪，其他动物便对他一顿奚落，将他赶走了。





病人和医生


一个病人去看医生，医生问他感觉怎么样。他回答：“很好，医生，但我发现自己出汗很严重。”医生说：“这是好现象。”下一回来的时候，医生问了同样的问题。病人回答：“感觉跟平时差不多，但我经常发抖，一直感觉很冷。”医生说：“啊，这也是好现象。”到了第三次，他依然询问病人的健康状况，病人说这次感觉自己在发高烧。“这是好现象，”医生说，“你确实越来越好了。”最后，一个朋友来看病人，问他感觉怎么样，得到的回答是：“亲爱的朋友，我要死于种种好现象了。”





旅行者和悬铃木


一个炎热的夏日，两个旅行者走在一条光秃秃的、沙尘滚滚的路上。不久，他们走到一棵悬铃木下面，他们很开心地到茂密枝条形成的树荫下躲避太阳。他们一边休息，一边看着树，其中一个评论道：“悬铃木是种多没用的树啊，都不结果子，对人半点用都没有。”悬铃木愤怒地打断了他：“你们这些不知感恩的家伙！你正躲在我下面躲避炽热的太阳，享受着我的枝叶形成的阴凉，居然责骂我一无是处！”

训诫：很多付出都会遭遇忘恩负义。





跳蚤和公牛


跳蚤对公牛说：“你这么高大强壮，为什么还甘于为人们服务，替他们做所有的累活呢？你看我，小小的，你几乎都看不到，却能以人的身体为食，喝他们的血，却从来都不用做什么。”公牛回答说：“人对我很友善，所以我很感激他们，他们喂养我，给我住的地方，还时不时地爱抚我的头和脖子表达对我的喜爱。”“如果我允许的话，他们也会拍我，”跳蚤说，“但是我不让他们拍，要是被他们一拍，我就剩不下什么了。”





鸟、兽和蝙蝠


鸟类和兽类发生了战争，双方交战频频，各有输赢。蝙蝠并没有明确选择站在哪一方，但是当鸟类赢的时候，他就为鸟类而战，而当兽类占了上风的时候，他就会和兽类站在一起。战争的过程中，谁都没有留意到他。一直到战争结束，双方恢复了和平，鸟类和兽类都无法容忍这种两面派的叛徒，于是直到现在，蝙蝠依然既不属于鸟也不属于兽。





男人和两个情人


有一个头发已经开始变灰的中年男人，他有两个情人，一个年老，一个年轻。其中年老的那个不喜欢有一个看起来比自己年轻很多的情人，所以男人每次来看她，她就会把他头发里面的黑头发往下拔，想让他看起来更老些。而年轻的那个情人却不喜欢男人看起来比自己老，便每次都趁机把灰头发拔出来，想让他看起来更年轻些。这样，她们把男人的头发给拔光了，男人完全变成了一个秃子。





鹰、寒鸦和牧羊人


有一天，一只寒鸦看到一只老鹰俯冲下去，用爪子抓住一只小羊羔。寒鸦说：“我看哪，我也可以做到。”所以，它也高飞到空中，然后扑扇着翅膀飞向了一头大公羊，它一落下来，爪子便紧紧地抓住了羊毛，但是却什么也做不了，它的爪子被羊毛缠住了，它扇动翅膀，但却越陷越深。最后，牧羊人来了，说：“噢，看看你做了什么！”他抓住了寒鸦，捆住它的翅膀，带回家给孩子们玩。寒鸦的样子看上去很奇怪，孩子们不知道它是什么。“这是什么鸟，爸爸？”爸爸回答说：“这是一只寒鸦，只是一只寒鸦，不过它希望自己被当成一只鹰。”

训诫：如果你想做超乎自己能力的事情，你的付出都会白费，结局注定不幸或是荒谬。





狼和男孩


一只狼刚刚饱餐一顿，情绪很好，看到了一个男孩平卧在草地上，他意识到男孩是在躲着他，是因为害怕他才这么躲的，所以，他便走过去对男孩说：“啊呀，我找到你了，如果你能对我说出三件绝对正确的事情，我就会饶了你的命。”男孩鼓足勇气，想了一阵，然后说：“第一，你看到我，真是不幸；第二，我让你看到了我，真是愚蠢；第三，我们都恨狼，因为他们总是无缘无故地攻击我们的羊群。”狼回答：“好吧，你说的从你的角度来看都足够正确，你可以走了。”





磨坊主父子和他们的驴


有一个磨坊主，带着小儿子，赶着驴去市场，希望能够把驴卖掉。走在路上，他们遇到了一群女孩，女孩们笑着说：“你们见过这样的两个傻瓜吗？明明可以骑驴，却还在这么一条沙尘滚滚的路上艰难跋涉！”磨坊主觉得她们说得有道理，便让儿子骑到了驴背上，他自己走在一边。不久，他们又遇到了他的几个朋友，他们跟他打招呼，然后说：“你这样会把你儿子宠坏的，你居然让他骑在驴背上，自己在费力走路！让他下来走路，让这年轻的懒骨头动一动！这对他只有好处。”磨坊主又采纳了他们的建议，自己骑上了驴，让孩子跟在后面走。没走多远，他们又遇到了一群带着孩子的女人。磨坊主听到她们说：“真是个自私的老家伙！自己舒舒服服地骑驴，却让可怜的小男孩在后面用尽力气全速跟着跑！”于是，他让儿子也上了驴。再往前走，他们又遇到了一些旅行者，旅行者问磨坊主，这头驴是他自己的财产，还是租来的。磨坊主说，驴是他自己的，他要带去市场上卖掉。旅行者们说：“天啊！这可怜的牲口负重那么多，到了市场肯定精疲力竭，没有人愿意看他一眼的。哎呀，你们最好还是扛着驴吧。”“只要如你们所愿，”老人说，“我们很愿意尝试。”于是，他和儿子从驴背上下来，用绳子绑住了驴的腿，然后用一根杆子穿起来，两个人抬着，终于到了镇上。这情形引来了很多人的关注，人们都跑来笑话他们，无情地嘲笑这对父子，有些人甚至叫他们疯子。他们正在过桥，驴因为周围的噪音和自己不寻常的处境而惊慌不已，便猛烈地踢腾，挣脱了绑着他的绳子，结果落入河里淹死了。于是，不幸的磨坊主又羞又恼，只好回家了。他才明白，他想努力去讨所有人的欢心，结果谁的欢心也没有讨到，最后还损失了驴。





雄鹿和葡萄藤


一只雄鹿被猎人追捕，于是藏身在厚厚的葡萄藤下。猎人失去了雄鹿的踪迹，他们从他藏身的地方经过，却根本没有发现他就躲在那里。发现危险已经过去，雄鹿便开始吃那藤上的叶子。这动静吸引了回来的猎人，其中一个认为肯定有动物躲在那里，便向着叶子当中射了一箭，正中不幸的雄鹿的心脏。雄鹿断气的时候说：“我如此对待保护了我的叶子，的确是罪有应得。”

训诫：忘恩负义者的行为有时便会给其带来惩罚。





被狼追赶的小羊


有一只狼追一只小羊，小羊躲进了一座庙中。狼让他快点出来：“你要是不出来，祭司会抓住你，把你放在祭坛上献祭的。”小羊回答：“谢谢啦，我觉得我还是留在这儿比较好，我宁愿某一天成为牺牲品被献祭，也不愿意被一只狼吃掉。”





弓箭手和狮子


有一个弓箭手带着弓箭进山打猎，所有的动物一看到他就都跑了，只有狮子留在最后，向人发起挑战。弓箭手把一支箭射向狮子，射中了他。弓箭手说：“看到我的信使能做什么了吧。等一下我亲自来处理你。”尽管箭伤很痛，但是狮子还是用尽全力飞速逃跑。狐狸看到了，对狮子说：“别做胆小鬼，你为什么不留下来大战一场呢？”但是狮子回答：“你别想让我留下来，你不可以的。哎呀，那人派了个这样的信使来，他本人肯定是个更难对付的可怕家伙。”

训诫：对能远攻者，要更敬而远之。





狼和山羊


有一只狼看到一只山羊在陡峭的山崖顶上吃草，狼想吃羊，却爬不上去，于是想引诱山羊下来。“夫人啊，你怎么冒着生命危险去了那高处啊？请你接受我的建议，快快下来吧，这里能找到更多更好的食物。”山羊颇有深意地看了看狼，说：“你可不怎么关心我吃到的草是好是坏，你想吃的是我。”





生病的雄鹿


有一只雄鹿病了，躺在森林里的一块空地上，虚弱得没有办法离开那里。他生病的消息迅速传开，其他的动物听说了就来询问他的健康状况，他们全都啃了一些长在那空地上的草，结果最后，雄鹿能够到的地方一个草叶都没有了。过了几天，他开始康复，但是他依然很虚弱，站不起来，没有办法去找食物，因此他不幸地饿死了，而这全都是因为他那些朋友欠考虑。





驴和骡子


有一个人有一头驴和一头骡子，有一天，他让他们两个都驮上了重物出门旅行。开始的时候，路途平坦，驴表现良好，但是后来，他们来到了山边，路变得崎岖不平，而且还很陡，驴便喘不上气来了。他恳求骡子帮他分担一部分重物，但是骡子拒绝了。最后，由于体力耗尽，驴脚下踉跄，从一个陡坡上滚了下去，摔死了。主人很难过，却也只能尽力而为，他把驴身上驮的东西放到了骡子身上，然后又把驴的皮剥了下来，将那皮罩在了两份重物之上。骡子只能勉强支撑，他一路脚步蹒跚，自言自语道：“我这是活该。如果一开始同意帮助驴，我现在就不用背着他的负担和他的皮了。”





兄妹


有一个人有两个孩子，一个男孩，一个女孩。男孩长得很英俊，但是女孩相貌平平。有一天，他们一起在妈妈的房间里玩，看到了一面镜子，这是他们第一次看到自己的样子。男孩看到自己是个英俊的人，于是便向妹妹炫耀自己的好容貌；而妹妹呢，发现自己相貌平平，又羞又恼，都要哭了，更把哥哥的评价当作了对自己的羞辱。于是她跑去见爸爸，告诉他哥哥的自负，指责他乱动妈妈的东西。父亲笑着，亲了亲两个孩子，说：“孩子们，从现在起学着好好学习使用那面玻璃镜子吧。你，我的儿子，要一直努力保持良好品行，才能配上它显示出的你的美好；而你，我的女儿，要努力保持自己的美好品格，来弥补自己外表上的不足。”





小母牛和公牛


有一头小母牛来到一头拉着耕犁卖力耕作的公牛旁，十分同情他，看到他必须这么辛苦劳作，感觉自己高他一等。没过多久，村民们过节，那天大家都要休息，因此公牛被放到了牧场上吃草，但是小母牛却被抓去献祭。公牛冷笑着说：“唉，我现在明白你为什么能如此悠闲度日了，因为你一直都是为祭坛准备的。”





狮子统治的国度


狮子统治着百兽，他既不残忍，也不暴虐，而是像国王应该做到的那样温和而公正。在他统治期间，召集了一次百兽会议，拟出一套法律，在这套法律之下，百兽都平等而和谐地生活着：狼和羊，虎和鹿，豹和羊，狗和兔，全都互相支持，友谊坚固，牢不可破。野兔说：“啊！弱者能够毫不畏惧地站在强者面前，我一直都盼着这样的日子啊！”





驴和赶驴的人


有一头驴被赶着走在山路上，他很听话地走了一阵子之后，突然间放弃正路，急匆匆地奔向了悬崖的边缘。他正准备跳下去的时候，赶驴的人拉住了他的尾巴，用尽力气要把他拉回来，但是却没有办法让驴离开悬崖边。最后他放弃了，说：“好吧，现在你顺着你的路走到头吧，那可是一条速死的路，你很快就会发现的。”





狮子和野兔


狮子发现野兔在睡觉，便想吃掉她，但这时他看见了一头雄鹿经过，便丢下野兔，去追逐更大的猎物。但经过漫长的追逐，他并没有捉住雄鹿，只好放弃，准备回去吃掉野兔。但是回到原来的地方，他却发现兔子早就不见了。他没有东西吃，只能饿肚子。“这是我活该。我本应该满足于得到的东西，而不该贪心去追逐更多。”





狼和狗


狼对狗说：“我们为什么要做敌人呢？你们在很多方面和我们都是一样的，我们之间最主要的不同就是你们是被驯养的，而我们是自由长大的，因此你们受人类奴役，他们打你，给你们的脖子上戴上沉重的项圈，驱使你们帮他们看顾牧群，而最可恶的是，他们除了给你们骨头吃再也不给你们别的。别过这种日子了，把牧群交给我们吧，我们可以都养尊处优，一起享受。”狗被他们说服了，便随着狼去了狼窝，但是一进去，狼就扑向了他们，将他们撕成了碎片。

训诫：叛徒的命运纯属罪有应得。





公牛和小牛犊


有一头成年公牛体形巨大，有一次他想挤过一道窄门进入牛舍。这时一头小牛犊走过来说：“如果你能挪开片刻，我就可以给你展示怎么钻过这道门。”公牛转头看着他，脸上满是嘲笑地说：“你还没出生我就知道该怎么过了。”





树和斧子


一个伐木工去树林里，请求树帮他的忙，做他的斧子的柄。面对这么谦卑的请求，大树立刻答应了，毫不犹豫地给了他一根小白蜡树枝，伐木工用这根树枝做成了斧子柄。一做好，他就开始砍森林里面最贵重的树。树们看到他们送他的礼物被如此使用，便都哀号道：“哎呀！哎呀！我们要完了，但是我们只能怪我们自己啊。我们送出的那根小树枝，令我们所有人都跟着葬送掉了性命，如果没有牺牲那根小白蜡树枝，也许我们会永远站在这里。”





天文学家


有一个天文学家，习惯在晚上出门观星。一个晚上，他走出了城门，专注地看着天空，没有留意自己脚下的路，结果掉进了一口枯井中。他躺在井底，哀声呻吟。有人经过，听到了他的声音，来到井口向下看，得知发生的事情后，便说：“如果你说的是真的，你那么专注地看着天空却没有留意你的脚把你带向哪里，那我觉得，你落得现在的下场，也是活该。”





劳工和蛇


有一个劳工的小儿子被蛇咬伤了，并因此而死。父亲十分悲伤，愤怒地举起斧子，站在蛇洞口，等着机会杀蛇。蛇一露头，那人便猛地一击，但是却只砍掉了蛇的尾巴尖，蛇转身逃掉了。他想引诱蛇再次出来，便谎称自己想要对刚才的争斗作出补偿。但是蛇说：“我永远都不会成为你的朋友，因为你我失去了自己的尾巴，而你也不会成为我的朋友，因为我你失去了你的儿子。”

训诫：面对造成伤害的人，伤害永远都不会被忘记。





笼中鸟和蝙蝠


有一只唱歌的小鸟被关在笼子里，笼子被挂在窗户外面，当其他鸟都睡着的时候，她总是唱歌。有一天晚上，一只蝙蝠来了，抓住笼子上的条栅，问那只鸟为什么白天沉默晚上唱歌。“我这么做的理由很充分，”小鸟回答说，“我原来在白天唱歌，结果一个捕鸟人被我的声音吸引，张网抓住了我。从那以后，我便只在晚上唱歌了。”但是蝙蝠回答说：“你现在已经是笼中鸟，再这么做根本没有什么意义，如果你能在被抓前这样做，你现在还会是自由自在的。”

训诫：事后再警惕并没有用。





驴和买家


有一个人想要买一头驴，便去了市场。他碰到了一头看上去还不错的牲口，于是便和驴的主人达成协议，他可以把驴牵回家试用，看看到底怎样。到家后，他把驴放进自己的畜栏中，和其他驴放在一起。这新来的驴环顾四周，立刻选择了畜栏中最懒惰、最贪婪的牲口旁边的位置。买主看到，便马上给他套上笼头，牵着他还给了主人。主人很好奇他怎么这么快就回来了。“你是说你已经测试过他了？”“我不想让他再做任何测试了，”买主回答说，“我从他给自己选择的朋友就可以看出他是什么样的牲口。”

训诫：一个人有什么样的朋友，就能说明他是什么样的人。





小羊和狼


有一只小羊离了羊群，被一只狼追赶。他发现自己肯定会被抓到，便转身对狼说：“先生，我知道我肯定没有办法逃脱被你吃掉的命运，我的生命注定如此短暂，我求你尽可能仁慈一些，你能不能吹支曲子，让我在死前跳支舞啊？”狼觉得在吃饭前听点音乐也没有什么不好，于是拿出笛子，开始吹奏，而小羊在他面前跳起了舞。没多久，守护羊群的诸神路过这里，听到声音过来看是怎么回事。他们一看到羊，便将狼驱赶走了，狼一边跑，一边回头对小羊说：“我可真是活该，我的行当是屠夫，可不该变成吹笛人来哄你开心。”





小羊和狼





欠债的人和母猪


有一个雅典人，陷入了负债状态，被债主催着还钱，但是他却没有办法拿出钱来，于是恳求宽限几天，但是债主却不同意，要求他立刻还钱。欠债的人抓住他仅有的一只母猪，带到集市上去卖。碰巧他的债主也去了集市。有一个买主过来询问那头母猪是否能够生出好的小猪崽。欠债的人说：“可以的，猪崽非常好。而且最了不起的是，她在米斯特里节生出小母猪，在潘纳希尼亚节生出小公猪。”（按照雅典的传统，在米斯特里节需要献祭母猪，在潘纳希尼亚节要献祭公猪，在酒神节的时候要献祭小羊。）听到这里，站在一边的债主插嘴说：“不要那么吃惊，先生，更了不起的是，这猪可以在酒神节生出小羊来。”





秃头猎人


有一个人，头发都掉光了，于是戴了一顶假发。有一天他出去打猎，那天的风很大，没走多远，风就刮跑了他的帽子，还有他的假发，引来了其他猎人的嘲笑。不过这个猎人很快便自己开起了玩笑，说：“哎，也是啊！做假发的头发不愿意长在原来的头上，自然也不愿意挂在我头上。”





牧民和丢失的公牛


一个牧民照顾牲口的时候丢了一头公牛，这是他的牲口中最好的一头。他立刻去寻找，却没有找到，他发誓说，如果让他找到偷牛贼，就向朱庇特献祭一头小牛犊。他继续寻找，走入了灌木丛，然后他看到一只狮子正在吃着他丢失的公牛。他被吓坏了，举手向天说道：“伟大的朱庇特啊，我是发誓说如果找到偷牛贼就向你献祭一头牛犊，现在，要是我能够自己安全地逃离他的魔爪，我愿意献祭一头成年的公牛。”





骡子


一天早晨，骡子吃了很多东西，却没有什么事情要做，他觉得自己的确是个挺好的家伙，他欢跳着说：“我父亲肯定是一匹精神勃勃的骏马，我完全继承了他的优点。”但是没一会儿，他就被套上马具，拉着沉重的货物，要走上很远的路。那天过完，他因为这不同寻常的劳作而精疲力竭，他沮丧地说：“我肯定是搞错我父亲的事情了，他可能只是只驴。”





猎犬和狐狸


一只猎犬在树林中游荡，看到了一只狮子，他过去经常抓捕小型猎物，便去追捕狮子，觉得自己能够收获良多。很快狮子便意识到自己被追捕了，便突然停下了脚步，迎向了追捕者，并发出一声怒吼。猎犬立刻转身而逃。一只狐狸看到他逃跑，便奚落他说：“呵呵！吼吼！这胆小鬼，还追狮子呢，结果一听到狮子叫就害怕得跑了。”





父亲和女儿


一个男人有两个女儿，他把其中一个嫁给了一个园丁，另一个嫁给了一个制陶工人。一段时间之后，他想他应该去看看两个女儿过得怎么样了。他先去看了园丁的妻子，问她过得如何，和丈夫好不好。她说他们大体上都挺好的。“只是我真希望能够下上一场大雨，花园很缺水。”然后他又去看了制陶工的妻子，问了她同样的问题。她回答她和丈夫也都没有什么要抱怨的。“只是，我真希望天能干燥些，这样陶器才能变干。”父亲的脸上浮现出好笑的表情。“你想要干燥的天气，而你姐姐却希望能下雨。我本来想帮你姐姐祈祷，但现在看来，我还是别提这件事情了。”





贼和旅馆老板


有一个贼在一个旅馆里租了一个房间，在那里住了几天，想看看有什么东西可偷。不过，却一直都没有机会，直到有一天恰逢一个节日，会有庆祝活动，旅馆老板穿上了一件特别好的新外套，坐在旅馆门前。贼一看到那件外套就想据为己有。由于店内没有生意，所以他便走过去，坐在了旅馆老板旁边，和他攀谈。他们聊了一会天，然后贼突然间打哈欠，并像狼一样号叫。旅馆老板关心地问他是不是不舒服。贼回答：“跟你说说我的事情吧，先生，但是请你帮我照看我的衣服，因为我要把它们留在你这里。我为什么会这样打哈欠我也说不清，也许这是对我的恶行的惩罚。但是不管为什么，事实上，当我打三次哈欠，我就会变成一只恶狼，飞扑向人们的喉咙。”他说完，便又打了第二次哈欠，又像刚才一样发出一阵号叫。旅馆老板相信了他的话，很害怕要面对一只狼，于是匆匆站起身，向旅馆内跑去，但是贼却抓住他的衣服，想要拦住他，他喊道：“等等，先生，等等，帮我看着我的衣服，要不我就再也见不到它们了。”他说着便张开了口，准备第三次打哈欠。旅馆老板担心自己被狼吃了，吓得都快疯了，于是褪掉了被小偷抓住的外套，缩进旅馆里，紧紧地锁上了身后的门，贼便带着战利品溜走了。





驮驴和野驴


一只四处闲逛的野驴有一天碰到了一只驮驴，驮驴平躺在地上晒着太阳，看上去十分享受。他走上前去，说：“你可真是个好命的牲口啊！你的皮毛光滑，说明你生活得很好，我真是嫉妒你啊！”没多久，野驴又看到了驮驴，这次驮驴运载着沉重的货物，赶驴的人跟在后面，拿一根粗棍子打着他。野驴说：“啊呀，我的朋友，我再也不嫉妒你了，你为了享受舒适付出的代价可是很昂贵的。”

训诫：付出高昂代价换来的好处很难说是福分。





驴和主人


有一个园丁有一只驴，他对驴非常不好，食物不足，负担沉重，还经常殴打他。因此，驴恳求朱庇特能让他离开园丁，换一个主人。于是朱庇特派墨丘利去见园丁，说服他将驴卖掉，园丁照办了。但是驴依然不满，因为他现在要干的活儿比过去更多了，所以他又去求朱庇特，朱庇特欣然同意，驴被卖给了一个制革工人。但是当驴看到新主人的行当后，绝望地哭了。“为什么我要对过去的主人不满呢？尽管我需要干活，受到的待遇也不好，但等我死了他们会将我体面地埋了，而现在呢，我却会变成皮瓮了。”

训诫：仆人在遇到更坏的主人前，不知道自己的主人是好的。





驮驴、野驴和狮子


一只野驴看到一只驮驴驮着沉重的货物慢慢走在路上，便嘲笑他被奴役的处境。“和我一比，你的命可真惨啊！我像空气一样自由，从来都不需要劳作。要吃草，我就上山，那儿应有尽有。但是你呢，你依靠主人给你食物，他让你每天都驮运沉重的货物，还无情地打你。”就在这时，出现了一只狮子，因为有赶驴的人在，他没有去攻击驮驴，而是扑向了野驴，野驴毫无依靠，立刻落入了狮口。

训诫：无法自立时，自立没有什么意义。





蚂蚁


从前，蚂蚁也是人，以耕种为生，但是他们不满意自己辛苦劳作换来的成果，便把注意力投注到邻人的粮食和果实之上，只要有机会，他们便会去偷来加入自己的仓库。最后，他们的贪婪引起了朱庇特的愤怒，朱庇特将他们变成了蚂蚁。然而，尽管他们的形态已经改变，但是本性却还是难改，所以直到今天，他们还是去田地中收集其他人劳作的成果，藏入自己的粮仓供自己使用。

训诫：你可以惩罚一个贼，但却无法改变他的习惯。





青蛙和井


两只青蛙住在一片沼泽中。一个炎热的夏季，沼泽干涸了，于是青蛙便离开那里，想寻找另一个地方生活，因为青蛙喜欢潮湿的地方。最后，他们来到了一口深井边，其中一个向井内看，对另一个说：“这看上去是个又漂亮又凉快的地方，咱们跳进去住在这里吧。”但是另一只青蛙更聪明一些，他回答说：“不要那么匆忙，我的朋友，想想如果这口井也像沼泽一样干涸了，我们该怎么出来呢？”

训诫：三思而后行。





青蛙和井





螃蟹和狐狸


有一只螃蟹离开海滩，到内陆草原定居，草原看上去美丽可爱，是个适合生活的好地方。但是这时一只饥饿的狐狸路过，看到螃蟹，抓住了他。要被吃掉的时候，螃蟹说：“我可真是活该啊，我无缘无故离开了大海的家，来到这里，好像我属于陆地似的。”

训诫：要乐天知命。





狐狸和蚱蜢


蚱蜢坐在一棵树的树枝上唱歌。一只狐狸听到了，觉得可以将她吃掉。于是，他试图骗她下来。他一直看着她，用尽花言巧语夸赞她的歌声，乞求她落下来，说自己很想和拥有这么美好歌喉的人做朋友。但是蚱蜢没有上当，回答说：“如果你以为我会下来，那你就错了，我亲爱的先生，自从看到一个狐狸窝的入口处有一些断了的蚱蜢的翅膀，我就一直远离你们族类。”





农夫、孩子和乌鸦


有一个农夫刚刚耕种完一片麦子，便很用心地盯着那片地，因为有一群乌鸦和八哥总是落在田中吃种子。他带着儿子一起去，孩子的手里拿着一个弹弓。每一次农夫跟孩子要弹弓，八哥都能够听懂，便会警告乌鸦，然后他们就会立刻飞走。后来农夫发现了其中的秘密，便说：“孩子，我们得想办法制服这些鸟。从此以后，我要是想要弹弓，我不会说弹弓，而是说‘哼’，你就必须立刻把弹弓给我。”一会儿鸟群飞回来了，农夫便说：“哼！”鸟群没有注意，于是他抓住机会，射出了好几块石头，在鸟群飞走之前，打中了一只鸟的头，射中了另一只鸟的腿，还击中一只鸟的翅膀。鸟儿们匆忙逃窜，路上碰到了几只鹳，鹳问他们发生了什么事情。“什么事？”一只乌鸦说，“就是那些杂种，那些人，就是他们！不要靠近他们。他们说一种东西，却指的是另一种东西，他们刚害死了我们好几个可怜的朋友。”





驴和狗


一只驴和一只狗一起旅行，路上他们发现了一个系着口的包。驴把包捡了起来，解开发现里面装着的是一些写着字的东西。他便大声读出来给狗听。那上面都是关于青草、大麦、干草等驴感兴趣的内容。狗听来听去，十分不耐烦，最后终于爆发，叫道：“跳过一些页面吧，朋友，看看有没有关于肉和骨头的内容。”驴浏览完所有内容后，发现没有，便如实告诉了狗。狗嫌弃地说：“哦，那把它扔了吧，快点，留着这样的东西又有什么用呢？”





驮神像的驴


有一个人把一尊神像驮在驴背上，赶着驴去城里的一座神庙。他们走在路上，人们见了，全都向神像脱帽致敬。驴以为人们是在敬拜他，便趾高气扬起来。他自负起来，想象自己可以随心所欲，为所欲为，于是便抗议自己还要驮负重物，他停下了脚步，坚决不肯再往前走。赶驴的人发现他不服管教，便用棍子狠狠地打了他，并说道：“哎呀，你这个没脑子的白痴，你以为那都是因为人们崇拜一只驴吗？”

训诫：依靠别人来获得赞扬的人必会遭遇狂暴的打击。





雅典人和底比斯人


一个雅典人和一个底比斯人一起行路，和其他的旅行者一样，他们在路上聊天来打发时间。在谈论了很多话题之后，他们谈到了英雄，这个话题虽然没有太多教育意义，却有许多值得说的。他们都大力夸耀各自城邦的英雄，到最后，底比斯人坚持说赫拉克勒斯是世上最伟大的英雄，现在跻身于众神的前列。而雅典人则坚称忒修斯更加伟大，因为他的命运在多方面都受到了眷顾，而赫拉克勒斯却曾经被迫为奴。他证明了自己的观点，因为他像所有的雅典人一样牙尖嘴利，底比斯人在说话方面根本不是他的对手，最后厌恶地说：“好吧，随便你，我只希望，我们的英雄发怒，让雅典人尝尝赫拉克勒斯的厉害，而底比斯人则只受忒修斯的苦。”





牧羊人和山羊


有一天，有一个牧羊人赶齐了自己的羊，准备回家，这时一只山羊离群而去，不愿意加入队伍。牧羊人花费了很大工夫，又是吹哨又是呼叫，想把羊哄回来，但是这只山羊不理不睬。最后，牧羊人丢出了一块石头，却砸坏了山羊的角。牧羊人万分沮丧，恳求山羊不要把这件事告诉主人。山羊答道：“你这傻瓜，就算我不说，犄角也在那明摆着啊。”

训诫：想要隐藏不能隐藏之物毫无意义。





牧羊人和山羊





羊和狗


从前，羊向牧羊人抱怨他把他们和狗区别对待。他们说：“我们觉得，你的安排非常奇怪，很不公平。我们给你提供羊毛，生产小羊，产羊奶，你却只给我们草吃，别的都不给我们，而且即便是草，也是我们自己去找的。但是对狗呢，你从他那里什么都得不到，却会把餐桌上的美味喂给他。”他们的议论被狗听到了，狗立刻发声：“是的，的确是这样，但是如果没有我，你们又在哪里呢？贼会把你们偷走！狼会把你们吃掉！实际上，如果不是我一直看着你们，你们会害怕得连草也不敢去吃。”羊不得不承认狗说的是对的，再也没有因为主人对狗的偏心而不满。





牧羊人和狼


一个牧羊人在草场中发现一只迷路的小狼，于是便将其带回家，和狗养在了一起。狼崽长大后，如果有狼来偷羊，他便和狗一起去攻击狼。有时候，狗追不上偷羊的贼，便放弃追逐回家。而那狼会自己继续追逐，等他追到偷羊贼，便会将其拦住，一起把偷到的羊分吃掉，然后再回去牧羊人的家。但是有时候，会有一段时间没有狼偷走羊，他便会自己偷上一只，和狗一起分吃。牧羊人渐渐起疑，有一天将狼当场抓住，用一根绳子拴住他的脖子，在离家最近的一棵树上吊死了他。

训诫：本性难移。





狮子、朱庇特和大象


狮子尽管体型壮硕，力量惊人，牙尖爪利，但在一件事情上却是个胆小鬼：他不敢听公鸡打鸣，只要一听到鸡鸣，他就会立刻逃跑。他痛苦地向朱庇特抱怨，为什么将他造成了这个样子，但朱庇特说这并不是自己的错误，他已经为了狮子做了所有能做的，而且这是狮子唯一的缺点，对此他也应该满足了。但是狮子的情绪并没有缓和，依然以自己这一方面的胆怯为耻，甚至想要去死。他这么想着，碰到了大象，便和大象聊了聊天。他注意到这头巨兽一直都支着耳朵，好像在听什么东西一样，于是便问大象为什么要这么做。就在这时，一只小蠓虫嗡嗡着飞了过来，大象说：“你看到那讨厌的嗡嗡叫的小虫子了吗？我特别害怕它进入我的耳朵，如果进去了，我就死定了。”一听到这事，狮子的情绪立刻好了起来。他对自己说：“大象尽管那么大，却害怕小蠓虫，我也不需要因为害怕公鸡而羞耻，公鸡可比蠓虫大一万倍呢。”





狮子、朱庇特和大象





猪和羊


一只猪想办法溜进了一片草场，草场中有一群羊在吃草。牧羊人抓到了猪，要把它送去给屠夫。猪大呼小叫，奋力挣扎，想要逃生。他搞出这么大动静来，羊儿们十分不满，对他说：“牧羊人经常这么抓住我们拖拉着走，我们可从来不会大惊小怪。”“是啊，我敢说你们不会，”猪回答说，“但是我和你们不一样，他只要你们的毛，而却要我的肉啊。”





园丁和狗


有一个园丁养了一只狗，有一天狗掉进了一口深井里。平时，园丁用绳子和桶从井里打水灌溉花园里的植物。园丁用尽了办法也没能将狗弄出来，最后自己下到了井里，要把狗捞出来。而那狗认为主人下来是要把他淹死，所以主人一到近前，他便狠狠地攻击主人，最后园丁便不再理会狗，让他听天由命，自己爬出了井，评论道：“这么费力去救一个坚持要自杀的家伙，我也的确是活该。”





河和大海


有一回，所有的河都联合起来，抗议大海把它们的水都变成了咸的。它们对大海说：“我们来找你的时候，全都甘甜可口，但是一和你合到一起，我们的水就变得像你一样又咸又涩，难以下咽。”大海的回答很简单：“离我远点，你们自然能保持甘甜。”





恋爱的狮子


有一只狮子深深地爱上了一个佃农的女儿，想要娶她，但是女孩的父亲却不愿意将女儿嫁给这么可怕的一个丈夫，但他又不想得罪狮子，于是想到了一个主意。他去见狮子，说：“我觉得你会成为我女儿的好丈夫，但是你如果不让我拔掉你的牙齿，剪掉你的指甲，我便不会放心你们的结合，因为我女儿非常害怕你的牙齿和指甲。”狮子是如此深爱那女孩，便欣然同意了这条件。然而，等他的武装被解除，那佃农便再也不怕他了，拿起大棍将他赶走了。





养蜂人


有一个贼趁着养蜂人不在，潜入了养蜂房，偷走了所有蜂蜜。养蜂人回来的时候，发现蜂巢空了，非常恼火，目不转睛地盯着蜂巢看了半天。没过多久，出去采蜜的蜜蜂回来了，发现蜂巢翻了，而养蜂人站在旁边，他们便去叮他。养蜂人一下情绪失控，哭道：“你们这些不知道感恩的坏蛋，让贼轻松偷走了我的蜜，然后却来叮花了那么多心思照顾你们的我。”

训诫：反击前确认是针对正确的人。





狼和马


一只狼溜达到了一片燕麦地，他却没有办法吃燕麦，他继续向前走，碰上了一匹马。狼说：“你看，那边有片很好的燕麦。为了照顾你，我一点都没有碰，我很喜欢听你的牙齿咀嚼成熟的粮食的声音。”但是马回答说：“我亲爱的朋友，如果狼能吃燕麦的话，你肯定不会让肚子空空的，去满足耳朵的需求了。”

训诫：将自己不要的东西给别人，并不是什么美德。





狼和马





蝙蝠、荆棘和海鸥


蝙蝠、荆棘和海鸥成了朋友，决定一起出海旅行。为了这次冒险，蝙蝠借了一些钱，荆棘带上了各种各样的衣服，而海鸥则带了铅锤，然后他们就出门了。结果，没多久，他们遇上了一场暴风雨，他们的船和上面的货物全都沉到了海底。不过三个旅行者挣扎着爬上了岸。从那以后，海鸥便总是在海面上飞来飞去，时不时地潜入水下，想要寻找自己丢了的铅锤。而蝙蝠害怕遇到债主，便总是白天藏起来，夜晚才会出门。荆棘则把每一个过路人的衣服挂住，希望有一天能够重获失去的衣服。

训诫：相比去获得自己所缺少的东西，人们总是更期望重新找回失去的东西。





狗和狼


狗躺在农场大门口晒太阳，这时有一只狼扑过来，想要把狗吃掉。狗求狼饶他一命，说：“你看我现在多瘦啊，根本不够一餐饭，如果你愿意等几天，主人到时候会举办一个宴会，那些剩饭都会给我吃，等我长胖了，你再吃我多合适啊。”狼觉得这是个好主意，便同意了。过了些天，他又来到农场，看到狗在马厩的屋顶上，他根本够不着。他喊道：“下来让我把你吃掉吧，还记得我们的协议吗？”但是狗冷冷地说：“朋友，如果你下次再抓住我躺在大门边，千万不要再等什么宴会了。”

训诫：第一次被咬，第二次就会避开。





黄蜂和毒蛇


一只黄蜂落在一条蛇头上，不止叮了他几次，而是一直都死死地叮在蛇的头上。蛇被这痛苦折磨得要疯了，用尽了各种办法，想要摆脱黄蜂，却徒劳无功。最后，他绝望地哭了起来：“我要杀了你！即便会要了我的命！”他探头到经过的车轮下，落在他头上的黄蜂便和他一起都死了。





鹰和甲虫


有一只鹰在追捕一只野兔，野兔疲于逃命，不知道该逃去哪里。她看到一只甲虫，便求他帮助自己。鹰过来的时候，甲虫警告她说，不要碰野兔，野兔在他的保护之下。但是鹰都没有看到甲虫，因为他实在太小了，鹰直接抓住野兔，将其吃掉了。甲虫对此事耿耿于怀，一直都盯着鹰的巢穴，每次鹰一下了蛋，他便爬过去，把蛋推出巢穴摔碎。鹰因为自己的损失而非常忧虑，最后去见鹰的保护神朱庇特，恳求他指点一个安全的地方给她筑巢，于是他便让她把蛋生在他的大腿上。但是甲虫看到了这些，用泥做了一个鹰蛋大小的球，他把那个球放在了朱庇特的大腿上。朱庇特看到泥球，便站起来要把泥球从衣服上抖落，结果忘记了鹰蛋。他把鹰蛋也给抖落下去了，那些蛋又像过去一样碎掉了。据说，从那以后，鹰便再也不在甲虫出没的季节生蛋了。

训诫：弱者有时也能找到方法报复强者。





捕鸟人和百灵鸟


有一个捕鸟人设置罗网要抓捕小鸟，这时一只百灵鸟过来问他在做什么。“我在建造一座城市。”他说着藏到了不远处。百灵鸟很好奇地检查了他的网，很快便看到了诱饵，于是就跳过去享用，结果却陷在了网里。捕鸟人立刻跑过去抓住了她。“我可真蠢啊。”她说，“不过，如果你是在建造这种城市，那你要找到足够多的傻瓜，这可需要很长时间呢。”





吹笛子的渔夫


有一个渔夫会吹笛子，有一天，他带着渔网和笛子去了海滩，在一块突出的礁石上站好，准备开始演奏，他认为自己的音乐能够吸引鱼跳出海面。他演奏了一段时间，却没有一条鱼出现，最后他扔下笛子，把网抛到了海里，捞到了一大网鱼。把渔网拖上岸后，他看到鱼不停地跳跃，于是叫道：“你们这些小杂种！我吹笛子的时候你们不跳舞，现在我不吹了，你们也做不了别的什么了！”





黄鼠狼与人


有一个人抓住了一只黄鼠狼，那只黄鼠狼一直在他家房子周围窥探。这人想把黄鼠狼压入水盆中淹死，黄鼠狼向人求情道：“你要把我杀死，还有没有良心啊？你想想我有多大用处啊，把在你房子里面捣蛋的老鼠和蜥蜴都替你清理干净了，你应该饶了我的命，来报答我。”“我承认你的确不是一无是处，但是谁把鸡给杀了的？是谁偷了肉的？不，不！你的害处比好处大多了，你必须得死！”





吹笛子的渔夫





农夫、驴和公牛


有一个农夫把公牛和驴一起套在耕犁上犁地。这两个动物之间配合很差，但是农夫却没有办法，因为他只有一头公牛。那天傍晚，两个牲口被从轭上松开，驴对公牛说：“唉，我们这一天可真累啊。现在我们谁来驮主人回家呢？”面对这个问题，公牛很是惊讶。“啊呀，那肯定是你啊，往常都是你嘛。”





德玛德斯的寓言


演说家德玛德斯有一次在雅典的议会演讲，但是人们一点也不关心他到底说了什么，于是他便停下来，说：“先生们，我要跟你们说一个伊索的寓言。”所有的人开始专心地听了起来。然后德玛德斯说：“得墨忒耳、一只燕子和一条鳗鱼一起旅行，他们来到一条没有桥的河边，燕子飞了过去，鳗鱼游了过去。”说到这里，他停了下来。“得墨忒耳呢？”观众中有好几个人问道。他回答说：“得墨忒耳很生气，因为你们在该关注公共事务的时候却只想着听寓言。”





猴子和海豚


航海的时候，人们总是会带着哈巴狗或是猴子做宠物，以消磨时间。有一个人从东方回雅典，船上便带着一只猴子。他们靠近阿提卡海岸的时候，遇到了一场猛烈的暴风雨，船沉了。船上的一切都掉到了水里，人们都努力游泳求生。猴子也是。有一只海豚看到了猴子，以为他是一个人，便把他驮在自己的背上，向海岸游去。当他们靠近雅典的港口城市比雷埃夫斯的时候，海豚问猴子是不是雅典人。猴子回答说是的，并且说自己出身于一个显贵的家族。“那你肯定很熟悉比雷埃夫斯了。”海豚说。猴子以为他说的是一个高官之类的人，便回答：“是啊，他是我的一个老朋友。”一听到这话，海豚便识破了他的伪装，恼怒异常，于是潜下水面。很快，不幸的猴子就被淹死了。





乌鸦和蛇


有一只饥饿的乌鸦，看到了一条蛇在晒着太阳睡觉，于是用爪子抓住了蛇，想带着它飞到一个地方去安静地享用美味。但这过程中蛇却抬起头咬了乌鸦。这是一条毒蛇，其毒性可以夺命，垂死的乌鸦说：“我的命可真不好啊！我以为自己很幸运地找到了好东西，结果却要了我的命。”





狗和狐狸


有一次一些狗发现了一张狮子的皮，各自叼在嘴里撕扯着。这时一只狐狸路过，说：“你们肯定觉得自己都很勇敢，可要是有一只活着的狮子，你们就会发现它的爪子可比你们的利多了。”





夜莺和鹰


一只夜莺落在一棵橡树的大树枝上唱歌，她总是如此。没多久，一只饥饿的鹰看到了她，飞过去用鹰爪抓住了她。他要把她撕碎吃掉，夜莺祈求他饶自己一命，她说：“我还不够大，无法让你饱餐一顿，你应该去更大的鸟里面寻找猎物。”鹰轻蔑地看着她：“你肯定以为我头脑简单，才觉得我会为了看不到的更多好处就放弃眼前的一些利益。”





玫瑰和不凋花


在一座花园里，玫瑰和不凋花挨着，一起绽放。不凋花对自己的邻居说：“我真是嫉妒你的美丽和你的芬芳。难怪你人见人爱！”但是玫瑰的回答却透着悲伤：“唉，亲爱的朋友，我也不过花开一时，我的花瓣很快就会凋零，然后我就死了。而你的花从来都不凋谢，就算被摘掉了也没什么，因为他们会不断长出来。”





人、马、公牛和狗


有一个冬天，遇到了一场猛烈的暴风雪，一匹马、一头公牛和一只狗到了一户人家恳求能进屋去避一避。人很热情地请他们进去，由于他们又冷又湿，便点起火来让他们舒服一些。他给马提供了燕麦，给公牛提供了干草，把自己晚饭剩下的东西给了狗吃。等暴风雪渐渐变弱，他们准备离开，决定要报答人的恩情。他们将人的一生划分成几段，各自根据自己所长，负责其中一部分。马负责照顾青年，因为年轻人精神饱满，不愿受束缚；公牛负责中年，因为人在中年脚踏实地，认真工作；狗则负责晚年，因为老人脾气暴躁，就像狗一样，喜欢依赖那些让他们舒服的人，对那些陌生的或是他们讨厌的人则撕咬不停。





狼、绵羊和山羊


狼派遣使团去和绵羊谈判，希望双方之间能够缔结永久的和平，只要他们能够将牧羊犬立即处死。愚蠢的绵羊要同意，但是一只老公羊见多识广，插口说道：“我们怎么能跟你们和平相处呢？哎呀，现在有狗保护我们，我们还逃不过你们的魔爪呢！”





天鹅


据说，天鹅一生只能唱一次歌，就是在它知道自己要死的时候。有一个人曾经听到过天鹅之歌，后来有一天，在集市上看到有卖天鹅的，就买了一只回家。过了些天，他请客人吃饭，便推出了天鹅，让它唱歌哄客人们开心。但是天鹅沉默无声。日子一天天过去，天鹅越来越老，它意识到自己的生命到了尽头，于是唱出了一支甜美而悲伤的歌。主人听到了，十分愤怒地说：“这个鬼东西，只有要死了才唱歌！那天我想听它唱歌是多蠢啊！我当时应该扭断它的脖子，而不是恳求它唱歌。”





蛇和朱庇特


蛇受够了总是被人类和兽类践踏，认为这种命运是因为自己长得太长了，而且他没有办法抬高身体。于是，他找到朱庇特，向他抱怨这种风险。朱庇特却不同情他。“我得说，如果你从一开始就把踩了你的人咬上一口，那以后的人就会仔细研究一下在何处落脚了。”





狼和影子


有一只狼在平原上漫游，天上的太阳越来越低，他的影子越来越长，他看到后大吃一惊，自言自语地说：“我真不知道自己这么巨大！想想过去，我居然害怕狮子！哎呀，我才是兽中之王啊，哪轮得到他！”他不留心环境是否危险，只顾炫耀自己，觉得事实就是这样。就在这时，一只狮子扑到他身上，开始大快朵颐。狼惨叫道：“哎呀，我真是罔顾事实，完全被自己的幻想给害了！”





农夫和狼


农夫把牛从耕犁上解下来，牵他们去喝水。有一只饿得半死的狼来到了田里，走到耕犁边，嚼着拴在犁轭上的皮带。他不顾一切地撕咬，想要借此饱腹，却被缠住了，惊恐之下，他挣扎着想要逃脱，却拖着犁在身后。等到农夫回来的时候，看到发生的事情，说：“哎呀，你这老浑蛋，我真希望你能就此不再偷盗，干起诚实本分的营生。”





墨丘利和被蚂蚁咬了的人


有一回，有一个人看到一条船整个儿沉没了，船上的水手无一幸免，于是便严肃地批评起神灵的不公来。“他们完全都不在乎人的品格，就这么让好人和坏人死在了一处。”他站的地方附近有一个蚁丘，他夸夸其谈的时候，一只蚂蚁咬了他的脚一口。于是他把气撒向了蚁丘，用力地跺了很多脚，几百只无辜的蚂蚁死于他的脚下。突然间，手持权杖的墨丘利出现了，对这个人说：“你这个恶棍，你的正义感现在跑哪儿去了？”





狡猾的狮子


狮子看到一只肥肥的公牛在草地上吃草，觉得那正可以成为自己的盘中餐，看着看着便流下了口水，但是他却又不敢攻击公牛，害怕他尖锐的牛角。然而，由于饥肠辘辘，他不得不采取行动，既然武力不一定有用，他决定运用诡计。他假装友好地走到公牛身边，对公牛说：“我情不自禁地来表达对您这样的健美体形的景仰之情。你的头长得多好啊！你的肩膀和大腿多有力量啊！但是我的朋友，到底为什么要长着这么丑陋的犄角呢？你肯定觉得既不好看又笨拙。相信我，如果没有犄角，你肯定会好得多的。”公牛十分蠢，相信了这番话，于是把牛角给砍掉了，因此失去了唯一能够自卫的武器，被狮子轻而易举就给抓住了。





鹦鹉和猫


有个人买了只鹦鹉，让它可以在屋内自由活动。鹦鹉狂喜不已，一下子就飞到了壁炉台上，心满意足地大喊大叫。这声音吵到了睡在壁炉前地毯上的猫。看着这个闯入者，猫说：“你是谁啊，从哪里来的？”鹦鹉回答说：“你的主人刚刚买了我，带我回了家。”猫说：“你这只粗鲁无礼的鸟，你一个新来的，怎么敢这么大吵大闹的？哎呀，我可是生在这里，长在这里，一辈子都生活在这里，如果我敢叫唤，他们就会朝我扔东西，追得我满世界跑。”“喂，听我说，猫小姐，”鹦鹉说，“你呢，还是管住自己的嘴巴吧。我的声音让人们喜欢，而你的声音则讨人嫌。”





雄鹿和狮子


有一只雄鹿被猎犬追赶，躲进了一个洞穴中，希望能够逃过一劫。但不幸的是，那洞穴里面住着一只狮子，雄鹿自然落入狮口。“我可真是可怜啊，我只是想躲开那几只狗，却落入了狮爪。”

训诫：才出狼窝又入虎穴。





骗子


有一个人病了，情况很糟糕，他发誓说，如果神能令他恢复健康，他愿意献祭一百头公牛。诸神想看看他是否遵守诺言，便让他迅速康复了。可是他却连一头牛都没有，于是他用油脂做了一百头小小的牛，送到了祭坛，同时说：“诸神，我请你们来见证，我来兑现自己的诺言了。”诸神决定以眼还眼，所以他们给他托了一个梦，让他去海边，在那可以找到一百个克朗。醒来之后，他十分兴奋，匆匆忙忙赶去了海边，结果却落到了一伙强盗手里，他们抓住他，将他当作奴隶卖掉了，他们卖掉他的价钱正好是一百个克朗。

训诫：不要空许诺言。





恶狗和兽皮


从前，有几只狗饿疯了，看到河里泡着几张兽皮，但是水太深了，他们够不到。于是，他们凑在一起，商量后决定把河水喝掉，等到水变浅些便去捞兽皮来充饥。但是没多久，他们就被水给撑爆了。





狮子、狐狸和驴


狮子、狐狸和驴一起去打猎。他们很快便打到了大量的猎物。狮子让驴负责分配。驴将猎物平分为三等份，然后谦虚地让另外两个动物先选。狮子勃然大怒，跳向驴将他撕成了碎片。然后他盯着狐狸，让狐狸重新分配。狐狸把绝大部分都给了狮子，只给自己留了一丁点。狮子说：“我亲爱的朋友，你怎么如此熟知这门技艺呢？”狐狸回答说：“我？啊，我从驴身上学了一课。”

训诫：能从不幸之人身上吸取教训就是幸运。





狮子、狐狸和驴





捕鸟人、山鹑和公鸡


有一个捕鸟人家中余粮不足，一个客人却不期而至，储藏室里空空如也，捕鸟人便去抓了一只驯养来作为捕鸟时的诱饵的山鹑，想要把它杀了。山鹑哭着问：“你肯定不想杀我的吧？哎呀，要是没了我，你下次去捕鸟，该怎么办呢？你该怎么吸引鸟走到你的陷阱里呢？”听到这话，他便把山鹑给放了，进了鸡舍，他在那里养了一只肥肥的小公鸡。小公鸡也为自己的性命求情，说：“如果你杀了我，你怎么知道夜里的时辰呢？没有我，谁在早晨叫你起来工作呢？”然而捕鸟人回答说：“的确，我知道你能报时，但是我不能让我的朋友饿着肚子上床。”然后他便抓住公鸡拧断了鸡脖子。





蚊子和狮子


有一回，蚊子飞到狮子面前说：“我一点都不怕你，我觉得你甚至没有我的力量大。你的力量到底有多大呢？你不过是能用爪子挠用牙齿咬，就跟个发脾气的女人一样，此外就没有什么能耐了。但是我可比你强大多了，你要是不信，咱们就来比比看啊。”这么说着，蚊子嗡嗡嗡地飞向狮子，叮在他的鼻子上。狮子感觉到他的叮咬，匆忙之下抓伤了自己的鼻子，自己流了血，却没有伤到蚊子，蚊子耀武扬威地嗡嗡飞走了，因自己的胜利而得意扬扬。不过，很快，他撞上了蜘蛛网，被蜘蛛给抓住吃掉了，在击败了百兽之王后，成了一个不起眼的小虫子的猎物。





农夫和狗


有一个农夫因为一场严重的暴风雪被困在了农庄里，没有办法出去获得补给。于是他把自己养的绵羊杀掉了，将绵羊肉当作食物。但是暴风雪还在继续，于是他又杀了山羊。天气还是没有好转，于是他又杀了牛，吃了牛肉。农夫养的几条狗看着其他动物被挨个儿杀掉吃光之后，便说道：“咱们最好能快点摆脱这种状况，要不然就轮到咱们被吃掉了！”





鹰和狐狸


一只鹰和一只狐狸成了好朋友，决定比邻而居。他们都觉得如果能经常见面，彼此之间的友情便会越发深厚。所以，鹰便在一棵高高的树梢枝头筑巢，而狐狸则在树根下的灌木中安家，还各自孕育后代。有一天狐狸出门去觅食，而鹰也要找东西喂养自己的雏鸟，于是飞入灌木，抓了狐狸的幼崽，当作自己一家的晚餐。等狐狸回来，发现了发生的事情，狐狸失去幼崽的悲痛远不及愤怒，因为她没有办法上到鹰巢里，报复鹰的背叛。所以她坐在不远处，开始诅咒鹰。没多久，她便复仇成功。有些村民碰巧去附近的神坛献祭一只山羊，鹰飞去抓起一块烧着的肉，带回巢穴。那天正刮着强风，鹰巢一下子失火，结果雏鹰全都被烤得半熟，摔在地上，然后狐狸冲了出来，在老鹰眼前将他们吞了下去。

训诫：天网恢恢，疏而不漏。





肉贩子和顾客


有两个人在市集上一个肉贩子的摊位前，想要买肉。肉贩子转身的工夫，其中一个抓起一大块肉匆匆忙忙塞到了另一个人的斗篷下面，藏了起来。肉贩子转过身来，立刻就发现肉不见了，指责那两个人偷了肉。但拿了肉的那个人说自己并没有得到肉，而有肉的那个人说自己并没有拿。肉贩子认定他们骗他，但他只是说：“你们的谎言可以骗我，但是你们骗不了神，他们不会就这么放过你们的。”

训诫：搪塞通常就是在撒谎。





赫拉克勒斯和密涅瓦


有一回，赫拉克勒斯走在一条窄路上，看到了眼前有一个苹果，他走过的时候脚跟踩在了苹果上。令他惊奇的是，苹果没有被踩碎，反而变得大了一倍。于是他又踩了一脚，还用手中的大棍猛击，苹果越来越大，大到把整条路都给堵住了。他吃惊地丢掉了手中的大棍子，看着这个苹果。这时密涅瓦出现了，对赫拉克勒斯说：“快走吧，朋友，你看到的可是个祸种，如果你不和它纠缠，那它还是当初那样小小的，但你暴力以对，它就变成了现在的样子。”





伺候狮子的狐狸


有一只狮子让一只狐狸伺候他，他们出去打猎时，狐狸负责寻到猎物，狮子则扑过去将猎物杀死，然后两个人分享成果。但是狮子总是分到大头，狐狸只分到一点，狐狸对此并不高兴，于是便想为自己打算。他想要从羊群中偷出一只羊来，但是牧羊人发现了他，派出狗来抓他。捕猎者反被追捕，很快他便被一群狗抓住撕了个四分五裂。

训诫：宁为太平的奴役，不享危险的自由。





庸医


有一个人病倒在床，时不时地会找些医生来咨询，所有的医生除了一个以外，全都告诉病人的妻子，他的病并不危险，但是他的病却一时治不好，得熬上一段日子。而那个例外的，总是最后一个被问到，他总是让病人做好最坏的打算。“你活不过二十四小时了，恐怕我无能为力。”可是，他却说错了。过了些天，病人已经康复，能够下床走路，尽管身体虚弱，面无血色。就在他散步的时候碰上了一直说他要死的医生。医生问：“先生，你怎么样啊？你肯定是刚从另一个世界回来。我们那些离世的朋友在那边过得如何啊？”病人回答：“都挺好的，他们都喝了忘川的水，忘掉了生活中的所有烦恼。顺便说一句，就在我临走的时候，管事的神同意要把所有的医生都处死，因为他们让病人无法自然死亡，却使用手段让他们活着。他们本打算把你和其他医生一起带走的，是我说服他们，让他们相信你根本不是个医生，而是个骗子。”





狮子、狼和狐狸


狮子年老体衰，生了病，躺在洞穴中，森林中所有的野兽都来问候他，只有狐狸没有到。狼认为这可是个好机会，他要和狐狸算算旧仇。所以他便提醒狮子狐狸没有来：“陛下，您看，我们全都来看望您了，只有狐狸没有来，他一点都不关心你的身体是否健康。”就在这时，狐狸来了，刚好听到狼最后的这句话。狮子很愤怒地冲狐狸咆哮，但是狐狸恳求能给自己一个解释的机会，说：“他们全都没有我关心您呢，陛下，我一直都在四处寻找医生，想找个将您的病治好的法子。”“那你找到了吗？”狮子问。“陛下，我找到了。”狐狸说，“你必须将狼给剥皮，趁着那皮子还热的时候裹在您身上。”狮子听了转头向狼，一爪子拍死了狼，想要试试狐狸提供的方子。而狐狸自顾自地笑了，说：“恶有恶报啊！”





赫拉克勒斯和普路托斯


赫拉克勒斯受到朱庇特的邀请，和诸神一起参加宴会，他对所有的神都很有礼貌，只是对财神普路托斯不礼貌。普路托斯走到他旁边，他就眼睛盯着地面，或扭头假装没看见对方。朱庇特很惊奇，问他为什么和其他神都如此友好，却对普路托斯如此。赫拉克勒斯回答：“陛下，我不喜欢普路托斯，我会跟您说明原因。因为我们都在人间的时候，我总是看到他和恶棍为友。”





狐狸和豹


狐狸和豹都觉得自己长得更好，比对方要英俊。豹说：“你看看我这身外衣，是多么闪亮。你可没得比。”但是狐狸回答说：“你的外衣的确是闪亮，可我的智慧更加闪亮。”





狐狸和刺猬


有一只狐狸，游泳穿过一条湍急的河流，却被水流冲走，尽管他奋力挣扎，还是被冲向下游很远的地方。最后他浑身是伤，筋疲力尽，才在一片回水处挣扎着上了岸。他躺在河岸上动弹不得，有一群牛虻落在他身上，镇定地吸着他的血，他太虚弱了，没有力气把他们赶走。这时一只刺猬看到了，问是否需要帮忙把这群折磨他的牛虻赶走。狐狸回答说：“哦，拜托，不用了，千万不要。这些牛虻已经吸了足够的血，现在不怎么吸了，但是如果你把他们赶走，就会飞来一群还饿着的，把我身上剩下的血都吸走，我的血管里就剩不下一滴血了。”





乌鸦和渡鸦


有一只乌鸦很嫉妒渡鸦，因为人类认为渡鸦是种神鸟，能够预知未来，所以很尊重渡鸦。乌鸦很想自己也能赢得些名誉，所以有一天，看到有一群旅客，便落在路边的一棵树上，呱呱地大声叫了起来。那些旅客很不喜欢这种声音，担心是什么坏兆头。有个人看到了乌鸦，对同伴说：“没事的，朋友们，不用担心，不过是只乌鸦，没什么的。”

训诫：胡乱模仿本不属于自己的特性，只会显得可笑。





女巫


有一个女巫声称自己能够依靠一种独有的秘密魔法阻止神的愤怒，她因此而生意兴隆，赚了很多钱。但是有些人指控她使用黑魔法，把她送到法官面前，说她和魔鬼交易，要求法官将她处死。她被认定有罪，被判死刑，在她离开被告席的时候，一个法官说：“你说你可以阻止神的愤怒，为什么你却没有办法解除人类的恨意呢？”





老人和死神


有一个老人在森林里砍了一捆柴，背着回家。路途很远，他还没走到一半就累坏了。他把背上的柴扔到地上，召唤死神，好让自己快点解脱。话刚刚出口，就令他大吃一惊，死神出现在他面前，准备为他效劳。他大惊失色，不知所措，结结巴巴地说：“先生，既然你如此善良，那求求你帮我把柴再背起来吧。”





吝啬鬼


有一个吝啬鬼，把他的东西都给卖掉了，把囤积起来的金子铸成了一大块，偷偷地埋在了一块地里。每天，他都要过去看看，有时候会在自己的财产边一待老半天。他的一个仆人注意到他经常去那个地方，有一天便偷偷地跟踪他，发现了这个秘密。他等待时机，一天晚上过去挖出了金子偷走了。第二天，吝啬鬼又去了，却发现自己的财宝不见了，他跪在地上扯着头发，哀号不止。他的一个邻居看到了，问他到底怎么了。吝啬鬼把遭遇告诉了邻居，邻居却回答说：“别太放在心上，我的朋友，在那洞里放块砖，每天过来看看，你的日子就和过去一样了，金子在你手里，你也没有什么用处的。”





狐狸与河


有一群狐狸聚在河岸边，想要喝水，但是水流湍急，河水看上去又深又险，没有人敢去喝，于是就站在岸边，互相鼓动其他狐狸不要怕。最后，有一只狐狸为了羞辱其他狐狸，显示自己的勇气，说：“我可是一点都不怕！看，我要直接走到水里去！”结果，他刚一喝到水立刻便被急流冲走了。别的狐狸见此，就大喊道：“不要走啊，不要抛下我们！回来让我们看看我们能够在哪里喝水才够安全。”那只狐狸回答说：“怕是不行啦，我想去大海，这水流会把我顺顺当当地送过去。等我回来，会很开心地告诉你们的。”





马和雄鹿


有一匹马在一片草地上吃草，那里一切都归他独享。但有一天，一只雄鹿来到这片草地，说他和马一样有权在那里吃草，还把草长得好的地方都划给了他自己。为了报复这位不速之客，马去找人，问人是否能帮他把雄鹿赶走。人回答：“好的，我会竭尽全力，不过你需要答应我，让我在你嘴上勒一条缰绳，在你背上放一个马鞍。”马同意了，于是人和马很快便将雄鹿赶出了草地。但从此后，马却发现事情有些令他沮丧，因为人永远成了他的主人。





狐狸和荆棘


在爬过树篱的时候，狐狸失足没踩稳，抓住一根荆棘才没有掉下去。当然，他被荆棘给划伤了，于是恼怒地向荆棘说：“我是需要你的帮助，可是看看你是怎么对我的！我还不如直接摔下去呢！”荆棘打断他的话说道：“朋友，你可真是糊涂了，居然来抓我，我可是一向去抓别的东西的。”





狐狸和蛇


有一条蛇过河的时候被水流冲走了，费尽力气才把自己缠在一丛漂在水面上的荆棘上，顺着水快速漂向下游。岸边有一只狐狸看到了，大叫说：“真好玩啊！那船客和船真是绝配！”





狮子、狐狸和雄鹿


有一只狮子生病了，躺在洞穴中，没有办法自己出去觅食。于是对过来探望的朋友狐狸说：“我亲爱的朋友啊，希望你能够去那远处的森林里，把生活在那里的大雄鹿骗到我的洞穴来，我真的希望餐桌上能有鹿心和鹿脑吃。”狐狸去了森林，找到雄鹿，对他说：“亲爱的先生，你可真幸运。你认识我们的国王狮子吧，唉，他正奄奄一息，想要将你任命为他的继任者，由你来掌管百兽。希望你不要忘了我是第一个来告诉你这好消息的。我现在可得回去见狮子国王了，如果你愿意听我一言，最好能和我一起过去，在他临死前和他待在一起。”雄鹿听了十分欢喜，便跟着狐狸去了狮子的洞穴，一点也没起疑心。雄鹿一进入狮子的洞穴，狮子便扑向他，但是狮子因病对自己的弹跳能力估计不足，雄鹿只是耳朵受伤，逃过了一劫，便转身飞跑回森林中。狐狸感到很羞耻，狮子也失望至极，因为尽管生着病，他也已经饿坏了。所以他求狐狸再去试一次。“这次是几乎不可能了，不过我会去试试。”狐狸说完便又去了树林里，发现雄鹿正在休息，想要从惊恐中复原。一看到狐狸，他就大叫：“你这个坏蛋，你把我骗去送死到底是为了什么啊！快走，要不我就拿角顶死你。”但是狐狸特别无耻，说道：“你可真是个胆小鬼！你肯定不知道狮子其实没有任何恶意吧？哎呀，他只是想凑到你耳朵边跟你说些神圣的秘密，你却跟个吓坏的兔子一样跑走了。你可真把他给惹火了，现在我真不肯定，他可能会选狼王来做继任者，除非你立刻回去，证明你的胆量。我跟你保证，他不会伤害你，我会是你忠实的仆人。”雄鹿不太聪明，被狐狸给说服了，跟着他回到了狮子的洞穴。这次狮子没有犯错，一下子扑到了雄鹿身上，大吃特吃了一通。狐狸趁着狮子不注意，将鹿脑偷走当作给自己的犒赏。等狮子开始找鹿脑来吃的时候，当然没有找到。狐狸在一边看着，说：“我觉得你还是别找什么鹿脑了，这家伙两回都被我骗到了狮子的洞穴，根本不会有脑子。”





丢了铁锹的人


一个男人在他的葡萄园里面翻地，有一天发现他的铁锹不见了。他觉得极有可能是被他的长工偷走了，于是便严厉地审问，但所有的长工都说不知道。他并不相信，坚持认为他们应该去城里，到神庙里面发誓自己没有偷盗。他觉得村子里的神思维简单，不值得信任，认为贼人肯定通不过精明的城里的神的考验。等他们进了城里的神庙大门，就听到一个城里人正在宣布关于悬赏偷盗了庙里物品的贼人的信息。那人听了自言自语道：“算了，我还是回家吧。如果城里的神都没有办法探查到从他们的庙里偷东西的贼，让他们告诉我到底谁偷了我的铁锹，估计是不太可能的。”





山鹑和猎人


有一个猎人用网抓住了一只山鹑，想把它的脖子扭断，山鹑向猎人恳求饶它一命。“别杀我，让我活着吧，我可以帮你把其他的山鹑都引到你的网里。”“不行，”猎人说，“我不会放了你，我一定要杀了你，你说了这么一通背信弃义的话，活该死在我手里。”





逃跑的奴隶


有一个奴隶因为不满生活待遇逃跑了。没多久，主人便发现了，立刻备马去追逐逃奴，很快就追上了。奴隶希望能够逃过一劫，便藏进了一架水车里。主人看到十分高兴：“啊呀，伙计，你躲的可真是地方！”(1)




————————————————————

(1) 水车都是由奴隶来操作的。





猎人和樵夫


有一个猎人进入丛林，想寻找一只狮子的踪迹，他看到一个樵夫正在砍树，于是上前询问是否在哪里见过狮子的足迹，或是知道狮子的巢穴在哪里。樵夫回答说：“你要是跟我走，我带你去见狮子。”猎人吓得脸色发白，牙关乱颤。“啊，多谢，我可不是在找狮子，我只是想找到他的踪迹而已。”





蛇和鹰


有一只鹰，从天而降，用爪子抓住一条蛇，想要把它带走飞到别的地方去吃掉。但是蛇反应敏捷，一下子盘起身子，把鹰给缠住了，他们两个展开了一场殊死较量。一个乡下人看到这场对决，过来帮助鹰摆脱了蛇的纠缠，让他能够成功逃脱。为了复仇，蛇吐了一些毒液到那人的酒壶之中。人费了半天力气，又累又饿，准备喝上一口酒解解渴，这时，鹰把酒壶撞飞，里面装的东西都洒了出来。

训诫：好心会有回报。





无赖和先知


有一个无赖和人打赌，说自己可以证明德尔菲神庙当中的先知根本不值得信任，他去询问得到的回答会是错的。于是，他按计划去了神庙，手里握着一只小鸟，藏到了自己的斗篷下面。他问先知那只小鸟是死的还是活的。如果先知说是死的，他就会把鸟活着拿出来；如果先知回答说是活的，那他就把鸟脖子拧断，拿只死鸟出来。但是先知却比他聪明太多，是这样回答的：“陌生人，你握在手里的东西是死是活，完全取决于你的意愿。”





马和驴


一匹马很为自己精美的马具而骄傲。他在路上遇到了一只驴，驴身上驮着沉重的货物，在给马让路的时候动作很慢。马便不耐烦地说自己真忍不住想要踢驴几脚，好让他动作快点。驴保持着心平气和，却没有忘记对方的傲慢无理。过了没多久，马患上了气喘病，被主人卖给了一个农夫。一天，他拉着一辆装肥料的车，再度遇到了驴。这次轮到驴嘲笑马了：“啊哈！你从来都没想过有这么一天吧，是不是？你是个多骄傲的家伙啊！你的那些漂亮装饰现在跑哪儿去了呀？”





马和驴





狗追狼


有一只狗在追一只狼，他一边跑一边想：我的身体多棒呀，我的腿多强壮呀，我是多么迅猛地飞奔在大地上啊。他自言自语：“这只狼真是可怜，根本无法与我匹敌，他有自知之明，所以才逃跑。”而狼只是回头看了看，说：“伙计，不要以为我是害怕你，我怕的是你的主人。”





悲伤之神和他的特权


朱庇特给诸神分配特权时，悲伤之神没有和诸神一起出现，但其他人都得到了自己的特权后，他又来要求自己的。朱庇特不知道该怎么办，因为已经没有什么特权留下来了。不过，最后，他决定悲伤之神掌控为死者而流的眼泪。于是，悲伤之神和其他神便都有了特权。人们对他的供奉越虔诚，他对人们的馈赠也会越丰厚。但是为死者悲悼过长时间并不合适，而悲伤之神仅有的乐趣就在这些哀悼之中，所以很快便会去寻觅能导致流泪的新机了。





鹰、鸢和鸽子


有一处鸽巢里的鸽子饱受一只鸢的迫害，这只鸢总是时不时地冲下来，夺去一些鸽子的性命。所以，鸽子便邀请了一只鹰来，帮助他们对抗仇敌。但他们很快便后悔自己的愚蠢：这只鹰杀死的鸽子比那只鸢要多得多。





女人和农夫


有一个女人，新近丧夫，每天都去丈夫坟墓上凭吊哀悼。有一个农夫在那片墓地附近耕作，看到女人后便很想将她娶回家中做自己的妻子。于是他丢下耕犁，到了那女人旁边，自顾自地哭了起来。女人问他为什么落泪。他回答说：“我妻子最近刚刚过世，她是我珍爱之人，哭泣可以令我好过一些。”女人回答说：“我最近死了丈夫。”于是，他们沉默了一阵。然后男人问道：“既然你我同病相怜，我们何不结婚一起生活呢？我替代你死去的丈夫，你替代我死去的妻子。”女人对这个提议很满意，这听起来的确合理。于是他们擦干了眼泪。就在这个时候，有一个贼偷走了农夫拴在耕犁上的牛。一发现牛被偷了，男人捶胸顿足，大声哀哭了起来。女人听到声音，过来问：“哎呀，你怎么还在哭啊？”男人回答说：“是啊，我这次是真哭啊。”





普罗米修斯造人


应朱庇特的要求，普罗米修斯创造了人类和其他动物。朱庇特看到人类是唯一有智慧的造物，数量远远少于没有智慧的野兽，于是就要求他把一些野兽变成人类，以平衡数量。普罗米修斯遵命而行，因此，现在有些人徒具人形，灵魂却如同野兽。





燕子和乌鸦


一只燕子跟一只乌鸦夸耀自己的出身。“我过去是个公主，是雅典一个国王的女儿，但是我的丈夫对我很冷酷，因为一点小错误就把我的舌头割了。为了远离更多的伤害，我求朱诺女神把我变成了一只鸟。”乌鸦说：“你现在已经够唠叨了，真想不出来你有舌头的时候是个什么样子。”





猎人和骑马的人


有一个猎人出去打猎，成功捉到了一只野兔。回家的路上，他碰到了一个骑在马背上的人，骑马的人说：“我看到你的猎物了，先生。”他要把野兔买下来。猎人很快便同意了，但是骑马的人一拿到野兔，就用马刺刺了马一下，全速飞奔逃走。猎人在后面追了一段，很快明白自己是被骗了，他不再追骑马的人，但为了保住面子，用最大的声音喊道：“算啦，先生，算啦，拿好那野兔吧，我本来就是打算送给你的呀。”





牧羊人和野山羊


有一个牧羊人，看着他的山羊在草地吃草，他看到一群野山羊过来和他的羊混在了一起。傍晚时分，他把羊赶回家，关进了羊圈。第二天，天气不好，他便没有像过去那样赶羊群出去，而是将它们关在羊圈里面，用饲料喂它们。只是他给自己的山羊的食物仅能维持它们不至于饿坏，但是给野山羊的饲料却多得多，因为他很希望它们能够留下来，他觉得如果他把它们喂养得足够好，它们就不会离开了。天气渐渐转好，他又把羊赶到草地上，但是一到山附近，野山羊便冲出羊群，纷纷跑了。牧羊人十分恼怒，严厉地咒骂它们忘恩负义。“浑蛋！我那么对待你们，你们居然这么一走了之！”听到这话，一只野山羊回头说：“噢，是啊，你对我们很好，有点太好了，正是这样我们才不得不防备。如果你对待新来的总是比你自己的羊群好，实际上你就是如此，如果过段日子来了另一群羊，你就会为讨好新来的而忽略我们了！”





夜莺和燕子


一只燕子和一只夜莺聊天，燕子建议夜莺离开树林里树叶繁茂的隐蔽之所，居住到人类中间来，就像她一样，把巢筑到人类的屋檐下。但是夜莺回答说：“我也曾经像你一样，生活在人类中间，但那时候我所经受的一些痛苦经历的回忆，让我觉得人充满了恶意，我永远也不愿意靠近人类的居所。”

训诫：过去受过的苦难记忆长新。





旅行者与幸运女神


有一个旅行者在经历了长途跋涉之后筋疲力尽，身体瘫在一口很深的水井边睡着了。他随时都可能掉落进水井中。这时候，幸运女神出现了，她拍了拍旅行者的肩膀，提醒他挪到离井远一点的地方。“醒醒吧，好先生，我求求你了，如果你掉进井里，人们不会说你蠢笨，只会怪我不好。”





THE FOX AND THE GRAPES


A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, “I thought those Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour.”





THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS


A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once. But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.

Much wants more and loses all.





THE CAT AND THE MICE


There was once a house that was overrun with Mice. A Cat heard of this, and said to herself, “That's the place for me,” and off she went and took up her quarters in the house, and caught the Mice one by one and ate them. At last the Mice could stand it no longer, and they determined to take to their holes and stay there. “That's awkward,” said the Cat to herself: “the only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick.” So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to be dead. By and by a Mouse peeped out and saw the Cat hanging there. “Aha!” it cried, “you're very clever, madam, no doubt: but you may turn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch us coming anywhere near you.”

If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airs of those whom you have once found to be dangerous.





THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG


There was once a Dog who used to snap at people and bite them without any provocation, and who was a great nuisance to every one who came to his master's house. So his master fastened a bell round his neck to warn people of his presence. The Dog was very proud of the bell, and strutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction. But an old dog came up to him and said, “The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend. You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a reward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace.”

Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.





THE CHARCOAL-BURNER AND THE FULLER


There was once a Charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself. A Fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same neighbourhood; and the Charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance and finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would come and share his house: “We shall get to know one another better that way,” he said, “and, beside, our household expenses will be diminished.” The Fuller thanked him, but replied, “I couldn't think of it, sir: why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be blackened in no time by your charcoal.”





THE MICE IN COUNCIL


Once upon a time all the Mice met together in Council, and discussed the best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat. After several suggestions had been debated, a Mouse of some standing and experience got up and said, “I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry it out. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach.” This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to adopt it, when an old Mouse got upon his feet and said, “I agree with you all that the plan before us is an admirable one: but may I ask who is going to bell the cat?”





THE BAT AND THE WEASELS


A Bat fell to the ground and was caught by a Weasel, and was just going to be killed and eaten when it begged to be let go. The Weasel said he couldn't do that because he was an enemy of all birds on principle. “Oh, but,” said the Bat, “I'm not a bird at all, I'm a mouse.” “So you are,” said the Weasel, “now I come to look at you.” And he let it go. Some time after this the Bat was caught in just the same way by another Weasel, and, as before, begged for its life. “No,” said the Weasel, “I never let a mouse go by any chance.” “But I'm not a mouse,” said the Bat, “I'm a bird.” “Why, so you are,” said the Weasel; and he too let the Bat go.

Look and see which way the wind blows before you commit yourself.





THE DOG AND THE SOW


A Dog and a Sow were arguing and each claimed that its own young ones were finer than those of any other animal. “Well,” said the Sow at last, “mine can see, at any rate, when they come into the world: but yours are born blind.”





THE FOX AND THE CROW


A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, “What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds.” The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, “You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits.”





The Fox and the Crow





THE HORSE AND THE GROOM


There was once a Groom who used to spend long hours clipping and combing the Horse of which he had charge, but who daily stole a portion of his allowance of oats, and sold it for his own profit. The Horse gradually got into worse and worse condition, and at last cried to the Groom, “If you really want me to look sleek and well, you must comb me less and feed me more.”





THE WOLF AND THE LAMB


A Wolf came upon a Lamb straying from the flock, and felt some compunction about taking the life of so helpless a creature without some plausible excuse; so he cast about for a grievance and said at last, “Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me.” “That is impossible, sir,” bleated the Lamb, “for I wasn't born then.” “Well,” retorted the Wolf, “you feed in my pastures.” “That cannot be,” replied the Lamb, “for I have never yet tasted grass.” “You drink from my spring, then,” continued the Wolf. “Indeed, sir,” said the poor Lamb, “I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk.” “Well, anyhow,” said the Wolf, “I'm not going without my dinner.” And he sprang upon the Lamb and devoured it without more ado.





THE PEACOCK AND THE CRANE


A Peacock taunted a Crane with the dullness of her plumage. “Look at my brilliant colours,” said she, “and see how much finer they are than your poor feathers.” “I am not denying,” replied the Crane, “that yours are far gayer than mine; but when it comes to flying I can soar into the clouds, whereas you are confined to the earth like any dunghill cock.”





THE CAT AND THE BIRDS


A Cat heard that the Birds in an aviary were ailing. So he got himself up as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after the health of the Birds. “We shall do very well,” they replied, without letting him in, “when we've seen the last of you.”

A villain may disguise himself, but he will not deceive the wise.





THE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE SWALLOW


A Spendthrift, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but the clothes in which he stood, saw a Swallow one fine day in early spring. Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do without his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch. A change, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp frost which killed the unfortunate Swallow. When the Spendthrift saw its dead body he cried, “Miserable bird! Thanks to you I am perishing of cold myself.”

One swallow does not make summer.





The Cat and the Birds





THE OLD WOMAN AND THE DOCTOR


An Old Woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, after consulting a Doctor, made an agreement with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he cured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing. The Doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment, and every time he paid her a visit he took away with him some article out of the house, until at last, when he visited her for the last time, and the cure was complete, there was nothing left. When the Old Woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his fee; and, after repeated refusals on her part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt. On being brought into court she was ready with her defence. “The claimant,” said she, “has stated the facts about our agreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed. Now, he says I am cured; but I say that I am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say. When my eyes were bad I could at any rate see well enough to be aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and other things; but now, when according to him I am cured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all.”





THE MOON AND HER MOTHER


The Moon once begged her Mother to make her a gown. “How can I?” replied she, “there's no fitting your figure. At one time you're a New Moon, and at another you're a Full Moon; and between whiles you're neither one nor the other.”





MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN


A Woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe, glancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water. As he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared and asked him the reason for his grief; and on learning what had happened, out of pity for his distress he dived into the river and, bringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost. The Woodman replied that it was not, and Mercury then dived a second time, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his. “No, that is not mine either,” said the Woodman. Once more Mercury dived into the river, and brought up the missing axe. The Woodman was overjoyed at recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly; and the latter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of the other two axes. When the Woodman told the story to his companions, one of these was filled with envy of his good fortune and determined to try his luck for himself. So he went and began to fell a tree at the edge of the river, and presently contrived to let his axe drop into the water. Mercury appeared as before, and, on learning that his axe had fallen in, he dived and brought up a golden axe, as he had done on the previous occasion. Without waiting to be asked whether it was his or not the fellow cried, “That's mine, that's mine,” and stretched out his hand eagerly for the prize: but Mercury was so disgusted at his dishonesty that he not only declined to give him the golden axe, but also refused to recover for him the one he had let fall into the stream.

Honesty is the best policy.





The Moon and Her Mother





THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION


An Ass and a Fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for food together. They hadn't gone far before they saw a Lion coming their way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened. But the Fox thought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the Lion and whispered in his ear, “I'll manage that you shall get hold of the Ass without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let me go free.” The Lion agreed to this, and the Fox then rejoined his companion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which some hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he fell. When the Lion saw that the Ass was safely caught and couldn't get away, it was to the Fox that he first turned his attention, and he soon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon the Ass.

Betray a friend, and you'll often find you have ruined yourself.





THE LION AND THE MOUSE


A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. “Please let me go,” it cried, “and one day I will repay you for your kindness.” The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. “There!” said the Mouse, “you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion.”





THE CROW AND THE PITCHER


A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of the remedy. At last she hit upon a clever plan. She began dropping pebbles into the Pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird was enabled to quench her thirst.

Necessity is the mother of invention.





THE BOYS AND THE FROGS


Some mischievous Boys were playing on the edge of a pond, and, catching sight of some Frogs swimming about in the shallow water, they began to amuse themselves by pelting them with stones, and they killed several of them. At last one of the Frogs put his head out of the water and said, “Oh, stop! stop! I beg of you: what is sport to you is death to us.”





THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN


A dispute arose between the North Wind and the Sun, each claiming that he was stronger than the other. At last they agreed to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest strip him of his cloak. The North Wind had the first try; and, gathering up all his force for the attack, he came whirling furiously down upon the man, and caught up his cloak as though he would wrest it from him by one single effort: but the harder he blew, the more closely the man wrapped it round himself. Then came the turn of the Sun. At first he beamed gently upon the traveller, who soon unclasped his cloak and walked on with it hanging loosely about his shoulders: then he shone forth in his full strength, and the man, before he had gone many steps, was glad to throw his cloak right off and complete his journey more lightly clad.

Persuasion is better than force．





THE MISTRESS AND HER SERVANTS


A Widow, thrifty and industrious, had two servants, whom she kept pretty hard at work. They were not allowed to lie long abed in the mornings, but the old lady had them up and doing as soon as the cock crew. They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour, especially in winter-time: and they thought that if it were not for the cock waking up their Mistress so horribly early, they could sleep longer. So they caught it and wrung its neck. But they weren't prepared for the consequences. For what happened was that their Mistress, not hearing the cock crow as usual, waked them up earlier than ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night.





THE GOODS AND THE ILLS


There was a time in the youth of the world when Goods and Ills entered equally into the concerns of men, so that the Goods did not prevail to make them altogether blessed, nor the Ills to make them wholly miserable. But owing to the foolishness of mankind the Ills multiplied greatly in number and increased in strength, until it seemed as though they would deprive the Goods of all share in human affairs, and banish them from the earth. The latter, therefore, betook themselves to heaven and complained to Jupiter of the treatment they had received, at the same time praying him to grant them protection from the Ills, and to advise them concerning the manner of their intercourse with men. Jupiter granted their request for protection, and decreed that for the future they should not go among men openly in a body, and so be liable to attack from the hostile Ills, but singly and unobserved, and at infrequent and unexpected intervals. Hence it is that the earth is full of Ills, for they come and go as they please and are never far away; while Goods, alas! come one by one only, and have to travel all the way from heaven, so that they are very seldom seen.





THE HARES AND THE FROGS


The Hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their lot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the strength and the courage to hold their own. Men, dogs, birds and beasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them daily: and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one and all determined to end their miserable lives. Thus resolved and desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighbouring pool, intending to drown themselves. On the bank were sitting a number of Frogs, who, when they heard the noise of the Hares as they ran, with one accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths. Then one of the older Hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to his companions, “Stop, my friends, take heart; don't let us destroy ourselves after all: see, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and who must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves.”





THE FOX AND THE STORK


A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup. The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth. Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement. But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.





THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING


A Wolf resolved to disguise himself in order that he might prey upon a flock of sheep without fear of detection. So he clothed himself in a sheepskin, and slipped among the sheep when they were out at pasture. He completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned for the night he was shut in with the rest. But that very night as it happened, the shepherd, requiring a supply of mutton for the table, laid hands on the Wolf in mistake for a Sheep, and killed him with his knife on the spot.





THE STAG IN THE OX-STALL


A Stag, chased from his lair by the hounds, took refuge in a farmyard, and, entering a stable where a number of oxen were stalled, thrust himself under a pile of hay in a vacant stall, where he lay concealed, all but the tips of his horns. Presently one of the Oxen said to him, “What has induced you to come in here? Aren't you aware of the risk you are running of being captured by the herdsmen?” To which he replied, “Pray let me stay for the present. When night comes I shall easily escape under cover of the dark.” In the course of the afternoon more than one of the farm-hands came in, to attend to the wants of the cattle, but not one of them noticed the presence of the Stag, who accordingly began to congratulate himself on his escape and to express his gratitude to the Oxen. “We wish you well,” said the one who had spoken before, “but you are not out of danger yet. If the master comes, you will certainly be found out, for nothing ever escapes his keen eyes.” Presently, sure enough, in he came, and made a great to-do about the way the Oxen were kept. “The beasts are starving,” he cried, “here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them.” As he spoke, he seized an armful himself from the pile where the Stag lay concealed, and at once detected him. Calling his men, he had him seized at once and killed for the table.





THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL


A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head. As she walked along, she fell a-musing after this fashion: “The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to market to sell. With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite a large poultry-yard. Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair; and all the young fellows will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and have nothing to say to them.” Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she tossed her head. Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!

Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.





THE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT


The Dolphins quarrelled with the Whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another. The battle was very fierce, and had lasted some time without any sign of coming to an end, when a Sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it; so he stepped in and tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends. But one of the Dolphins said to him contemptuously, “We would rather go on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a Sprat like you!”





THE FOX AND THE MONKEY


A Fox and a Monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born. They kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when the Monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh. “Why do you sigh?” said the Fox. The Monkey pointed to the tombs and replied, “All the monuments that you see here were put up in honour of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men.” The Fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, “Oh! Don't stop at any lie, sir; you're quite safe: I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you.”

Boasters brag most when they cannot be detected.





THE ASS AND THE LAP-DOG


There was once a man who had an Ass and a Lap-dog. The Ass was housed in the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well off as an ass could be. The little Dog was made a great pet of by his master, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap; and if he went out to dinner, he would bring back a tit-bit or two to give him when he ran to meet him on his return. The Ass had, it is true, a good deal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the burdens of the farm: and ere long he became very jealous, contrasting his own life of labour with the ease and idleness of the Lap-dog. At last one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the house just as his master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking the frolics of the little favourite, upsetting the table and smashing the crockery with his clumsy efforts. Not content with that, he even tried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so often seen the dog allowed to do. At that the servants, seeing the danger their master was in, belaboured the silly Ass with sticks and cudgels, and drove him back to his stable half dead with his beating. “Alas!” he cried, “all this I have brought on myself. Why could I not be satisfied with my natural and honourable position, without wishing to imitate the ridiculous antics of that useless little Lap-dog?”





THE FIR-TREE AND THE BRAMBLE


A Fir-tree was boasting to a Bramble, and said, somewhat contemptuously, “You poor creature, you are of no use whatever. Now, look at me: I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men build houses; they can't do without me then.” But the Bramble replied, “Ah, that's all very well: but you wait till they come with axes and saws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a Bramble and not a Fir.”

Better poverty without a care than wealth with its many obligations.





THE FROGS' COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SUN


Once upon a time the Sun was about to take to himself a wife. The Frogs in terror all raised their voices to the skies, and Jupiter, disturbed by the noise, asked them what they were croaking about. They replied, “The Sun is bad enough even while he is single, drying up our marshes with his heat as he does. But what will become of us if he marries and begets other Suns?”





The Fir-tree and the Bramble





THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX


A Dog and a Cock became great friends, and agreed to travel together. At nightfall the Cock flew up into the branches of a tree to roost, while the Dog curled himself up inside the trunk, which was hollow. At break of day the Cock woke up and crew, as usual. A Fox heard, and, wishing to make a breakfast of him, came and stood under the tree and begged him to come down. “I should so like,” said he, “to make the acquaintance of one who has such a beautiful voice.” The Cock replied, “Would you just wake my porter who sleeps at the foot of the tree? He'll open the door and let you in.” The Fox accordingly rapped on the trunk, when out rushed the Dog and tore him in pieces.





THE GNAT AND THE BULL


A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, “Do you mind if I go now?” The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, “It's all one to me; I didn't notice when you came, and I shan't know when you go away.”

We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.





THE BEAR AND THE TRAVELLERS


Two Travellers were on the road together, when a Bear suddenly appeared on the scene. Before he observed them, one made for a tree at the side of the road, and climbed up into the branches and hid there. The other was not so nimble as his companion; and, as he could not escape, he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead. The Bear came up and sniffed all round him, but he kept perfectly still and held his breath: for they say that a bear will not touch a dead body. The Bear took him for a corpse, and went away. When the coast was clear, the Traveller in the tree came down, and asked the other what it was the Bear had whispered to him when he put his mouth to his ear. The other replied, “He told me never again to travel with a friend who deserts you at the first sign of danger.”

Misfortune tests the sincerity of friendship.





THE SLAVE AND THE LION


A Slave ran away from his master, by whom he had been most cruelly treated, and, in order to avoid capture, betook himself into the desert. As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to a cave, which he entered and found to be unoccupied. Really, however, it was a Lion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the wretched fugitive, the Lion himself appeared. The man gave himself up for lost: but, to his utter astonishment, the Lion, instead of springing upon him and devouring him, came and fawned upon him, at the same time whining and lifting up his paw. Observing it to be much swollen and inflamed, he examined it and found a large thorn embedded in the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed it and dressed the wound as well as he could: and in course of time it healed up completely. The Lion's gratitude was unbounded; he looked upon the man as his friend, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came, however, when the Slave began to long for the society of his fellow-men, and he bade farewell to the Lion and returned to the town. Here he was presently recognised and carried off in chains to his former master, who resolved to make an example of him, and ordered that he should be thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theatre. On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena, and among the rest a Lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect; and then the wretched Slave was cast in among them. What was the amazement of the spectators, when the Lion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet with every expression of affection and delight! It was his old friend of the cave! The audience clamoured that the Slave's life should be spared: and the governor of the town, marvelling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast, decreed that both should receive their liberty.





THE FLEA AND THE MAN


A Flea bit a Man, and bit him again, and again, till he could stand it no longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last succeeded in catching it. Holding it between his finger and thumb, he said—or rather shouted, so angry was he—“Who are you, pray, you wretched little creature, that you make so free with my person?” The Flea, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice: “Oh, sir! pray let me go; don't kill me! I am such a little thing that I can't do you much harm.” But the Man laughed and said: “I am going to kill you now, at once: whatever is bad has got to be destroyed, no matter how slight the harm it does.”

Do not waste your pity on a scamp.





THE BEE AND JUPITER


A Queen Bee from Hymettus flew up to Olympus with some fresh honey from the hive as a present to Jupiter, who was so pleased with the gift that he promised to give her anything she liked to ask for. She said she would be very grateful if he would give stings to the bees, to kill people who robbed them of their honey. Jupiter was greatly displeased with this request, for he loved mankind: but he had given his word, so he said that stings they should have. The stings he gave them, however, were of such a kind that whenever a bee stings a man the sting is left in the wound and the bee dies.

Evil wishes, like fowls, come home to roost.





The Flea and the Man





THE OAK AND THE REEDS


An Oak that grew on the bank of a river was uprooted by a severe gale of wind, and thrown across the stream. It fell among some Reeds growing by the water, and said to them, “How is it that you, who are so frail and slender, have managed to weather the storm, whereas I, with all my strength, have been torn up by the roots and hurled into the river?” “You were stubborn,” came the reply, “and fought against the storm, which proved stronger than you: but we bow and yield to every breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads.”





THE BLIND MAN AND THE CUB


There was once a Blind Man who had so fine a sense of touch that, when any animal was put into his hands, he could tell what it was merely by the feel of it. One day the Cub of a Wolf was put into his hands, and he was asked what it was. He felt it for some time, and then said, “Indeed, I am not sure whether it is a Wolf's Cub or a Fox's: but this I know—it would never do to trust it in a sheepfold.”

Evil tendencies are early shown.





The Oak and the Reeds





THE BOY AND THE SNAILS


A Farmer's Boy went looking for Snails, and, when he had picked up both his hands full, he set about making a fire at which to roast them; for he meant to eat them. When it got well alight and the Snails began to feel the heat, they gradually withdrew more and more into their shells with the hissing noise they always make when they do so. When the Boy heard it, he said, “You abandoned creatures, how can you find heart to whistle when your houses are burning?”





THE APES AND THE TWO TRAVELLERS


Two men were travelling together, one of whom never spoke the truth, whereas the other never told a lie: and they came in the course of their travels to the land of Apes. The King of the Apes, hearing of their arrival, ordered them to be brought before him; and by way of impressing them with his magnificence, he received them sitting on a throne, while the Apes, his subjects, were ranged in long rows on either side of him. When the Travellers came into his presence he asked them what they thought of him as a King. The lying Traveller said, “Sire, every one must see that you are a most noble and mighty monarch.” “And what do you think of my subjects?” continued the King. “They,” said the Traveller, “are in every way worthy of their royal master.” The Ape was so delighted with his answer that he gave him a very handsome present. The other Traveller thought that if his companion was rewarded so splendidly for telling a lie, he himself would certainly receive a still greater reward for telling the truth; so, when the Ape turned to him and said, “And what, sir, is your opinion?” he replied, “I think you are a very fine Ape, and all your subjects are fine Apes too.” The King of the Apes was so enraged at his reply that he ordered him to be taken away and clawed to death.





THE ASS AND HIS BURDENS


A Pedlar who owned an Ass one day bought a quantity of salt, and loaded up his beast with as much as he could bear. On the way home the Ass stumbled as he was crossing a stream and fell into the water. The salt got thoroughly wetted and much of it melted and drained away, so that, when he got on his legs again, the Ass found his load had become much less heavy. His master, however, drove him back to town and bought more salt, which he added to what remained in the panniers, and started out again. No sooner had they reached a stream than the Ass lay down in it, and rose, as before, with a much lighter load. But his master detected the trick, and turning back once more, bought a large number of sponges, and piled them on the back of the Ass. When they came to the stream the Ass again lay down: but this time, as the sponges soaked up large quantities of water, he found, when he got up on his legs, that he had a bigger burden to carry than ever.

You may play a good card once too often.





THE SHEPHERD'S BOY AND THE WOLF


A Shepherd's Boy was tending his flock near a village, and thought it would be great fun to hoax the villagers by pretending that a Wolf was attacking the sheep: so he shouted out, “Wolf! wolf!” and when the people came running up he laughed at them for their pains. He did this more than once, and every time the villagers found they had been hoaxed, for there was no Wolf at all. At last a Wolf really did come, and the Boy cried, “Wolf! wolf!” as loud as he could: but the people were so used to hearing him call that they took no notice of his cries for help. And so the Wolf had it all his own way, and killed off sheep after sheep at his leisure.

You cannot believe a liar even when he tells the truth.





THE FOX AND THE GOAT


A Fox fell into a well and was unable to get out again. By and by a thirsty Goat came by, and seeing the Fox in the well asked him if the water was good. “Good?” said the Fox, “it's the best water I ever tasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself.” The Goat thought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and jumped in at once. When he had had enough to drink, he looked about, like the Fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none. Presently the Fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs, and plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then I'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your horns, I can get out. And when I'm out, I'll help you out too.” The Goat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away. The Goat called loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out: but the Fox merely turned and said, “If you had as much sense in your head as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well without making certain that you could get out again.”

Look before your leap.





THE FISHERMAN AND THE SPRAT


A Fisherman cast his net into the sea, and when he drew it up again it contained nothing but a single Sprat that begged to be put back into the water. “I'm only a little fish now,” it said, “but I shall grow big one day, and then if you come and catch me again I shall be of some use to you.” But the Fisherman replied, “Oh, no, I shall keep you now I've got you: if I put you back, should I ever see you again? Not likely!”





THE BOASTING TRAVELLER


A Man once went abroad on his travels, and when he came home he had wonderful tales to tell of the things he had done in foreign countries. Among other things, he said he had taken part in a jumping-match at Rhodes, and had done a wonderful jump which no one could beat. “Just go to Rhodes and ask them,” he said, “every one will tell you it's true.” But one of those who were listening said, “If you can jump as well as all that, we needn't go to Rhodes to prove it. Let's just imagine this is Rhodes for a minute: and now—jump!”

Deeds, not words.





THE CRAB AND HIS MOTHER


An Old Crab said to her son, “Why do you walk sideways like that, my son? You ought to walk straight.” The Young Crab replied, “Show me how, dear mother, and I'll follow your example.” The Old Crab tried, but tried in vain, and then saw how foolish she had been to find fault with her child.

Example is better than precept.





THE ASS AND HIS SHADOW


A certain man hired an Ass for a journey in summertime, and started out with the owner following behind to drive the beast. By and by, in the heat of the day, they stopped to rest, and the traveller wanted to lie down in the Ass's Shadow; but the owner, who himself wished to be out of the sun, wouldn't let him do that; for he said he had hired the Ass only, and not his Shadow: the other maintained that his bargain secured him complete control of the Ass for the time being. From words they came to blows; and while they were belabouring each other the Ass took to his heels and was soon out of sight.





THE FARMER AND HIS SONS


A Farmer, being at death's door, and desiring to impart to his Sons a secret of much moment, called them round him and said, “My sons, I am shortly about to die; I would have you know, therefore, that in my vineyard there lies a hidden treasure. Dig, and you will find it.” As soon as their father was dead, the Sons took spade and fork and turned up the soil of the vineyard over and over again, in their search for the treasure which they supposed to lie buried there. They found none, however: but the vines, after so thorough a digging, produced a crop such as had never before been seen.





THE DOG AND THE COOK


A rich man once invited a number of his friends and acquaintances to a banquet. His dog thought it would be a good opportunity to invite another Dog, a friend of his; so he went to him and said, “My master is giving a feast: there'll be a fine spread, so come and dine with me to-night.” The Dog thus invited came, and when he saw the preparations being made in the kitchen he said to himself, “My word, I'm in luck: I'll take care to eat enough to-night to last me two or three days.” At the same time he wagged his tail briskly, by way of showing his friend how delighted he was to have been asked. But just then the Cook caught sight of him, and, in his annoyance at seeing a strange Dog in the kitchen, caught him up by the hind legs and threw him out of the window. He had a nasty fall, and limped away as quickly as he could, howling dismally. Presently some other dogs met him, and said, “Well, what sort of a dinner did you get?” To which he replied, “I had a splendid time: the wine was so good, and I drank so much of it, that I really don't remember how I got out of the house!”

Be shy of favours bestowed at the expense of others.





THE MONKEY AS KING


At a gathering of all the animals the Monkey danced and delighted them so much that they made him their King. The Fox, however, was very much disgusted at the promotion of the Monkey: so having one day found a trap with a piece of meat in it, he took the Monkey there and said to him, “Here is a dainty morsel I have found, sire; I did not take it myself, because I thought it ought to be reserved for you, our King. Will you be pleased to accept it?” The Monkey made at once for the meat and got caught in the trap. Then he bitterly reproached the Fox for leading him into danger; but the Fox only laughed and said, “O Monkey, you call yourself King of the Beasts and haven't more sense than to be taken in like that!”





THE THIEVES AND THE COCK


Some Thieves broke into a house, and found nothing worth taking except a Cock, which they seized and carried off with them. When they were preparing their supper, one of them caught up the Cock, and was about to wring his neck, when he cried out for mercy and said, “Pray do not kill me: you will find me a most useful bird, for I rouse honest men to their work in the morning by my crowing.” But the Thief replied with some heat, “Yes, I know you do, making it still harder for us to get a livelihood. Into the pot you go!”





THE FARMER AND FORTUNE


A Farmer was ploughing one day on his farm when he turned up a pot of golden coins with his plough. He was overjoyed at his discovery, and from that time forth made an offering daily at the shrine of the Goddess of the Earth. Fortune was displeased at this, and came to him and said, “My man, why do you give Earth the credit for the gift which I bestowed upon you? You never thought of thanking me for your good luck; but should you be unlucky enough to lose what you have gained I know very well that I, Fortune, should then come in for all the blame.”

Show gratitude where gratitude is due.





JUPITER AND THE MONKEY


Jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts, and offered a prize to the one who, in his judgment, produced the most beautiful offspring. Among the rest came the Monkey, carrying a baby monkey in her arms, a hairless, flat-nosed little fright. When they saw it, the gods all burst into peal on peal of laughter; but the Monkey hugged her little one to her, and said, “Jupiter may give the prize to whomsoever he likes: but I shall always think my baby the most beautiful of them all.”





FATHER AND SONS


A certain man had several Sons who were always quarrelling with one another, and, try as he might, he could not get them to live together in harmony. So he determined to convince them of their folly by the following means. Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in turn to break it across his knee. All tried and all failed: and then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one, when they had no difficulty at all in breaking them. “There, my boys,” said he, “united you will be more than a match for your enemies: but if you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put you at the mercy of those who attack you.”

Union is strength.





THE LAMP


A Lamp, well filled with oil, burned with a clear and steady light, and began to swell with pride and boast that it shone more brightly than the sun himself. Just then a puff of wind came and blew it out. Some one struck a match and lit it again, and said, “You just keep alight, and never mind the sun. Why, even the stars never need to be relit as you had to be just now.”





THE OWL AND THE BIRDS


The Owl is a very wise bird; and once, long ago, when the first oak sprouted in the forest, she called all the other Birds together and said to them, “You see this tiny tree? If you take my advice, you will destroy it now when it is small: for when it grows big, the mistletoe will appear upon it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your destruction.” Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them, “Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which men will one day make nets to catch you.” Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them. But they took no notice of what she said: in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her. When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom. Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good. She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.





The Owl and the Birds





THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN


An Ass found a Lion's Skin, and dressed himself up in it. Then he went about frightening every one he met, for they all took him to be a lion, men and beasts alike, and took to their heels when they saw him coming. Elated by the success of his trick, he loudly brayed in triumph. The Fox heard him, and recognised him at once for the Ass he was, and said to him, “Oho, my friend, it's you, is it? I, too, should have been afraid if I hadn't heard your voice.”





THE SHE-GOATS AND THEIR BEARDS


Jupiter granted beards to the She-Goats at their own request, much to the disgust of the he-Goats, who considered this to be an unwarrantable invasion of their rights and dignities. So they sent a deputation to him to protest against his action. He, however, advised them not to raise any objections. “What's in a tuft of hair?” said he. “Let them have it if they want it. They can never be a match for you in strength.”





The Ass in the Lion's Skin





THE OLD LION


A Lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for himself by force, determined to do so by cunning. Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick: and whenever any of the other animals entered to inquire after his health, he sprang upon them and devoured them. Many lost their lives in this way, till one day a Fox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth, addressed the Lion from outside instead of going in, and asked him how he did. He replied that he was in a very bad way: “But,” said he, “why do you stand outside? Pray come in.” “I should have done so,” answered the Fox, “if I hadn't noticed that all the footprints point towards the cave and none the other way.”





THE BOY BATHING


A Boy was bathing in a river and got out of his depth, and was in great danger of being drowned. A man who was passing along a road hand by heard his cries for help, and went to the riverside and began to scold him for being so careless as to get into deep water, but made no attempt to help him. “Oh, sir,” cried the Boy, “please help me first and scold me afterwards.”

Give assistance, not advice, in a crisis.





THE QUACK FROG


Once upon a time a Frog came forth from his home in the marshes and proclaimed to all the world that he was a learned physician, skilled in drugs and able to cure all diseases. Among the crowd was a Fox, who called out, “You a doctor! Why, how can you set up to heal others when you cannot even cure your own lame legs and blotched and wrinkled skin?”

Physician, heal thyself.





THE SWOLLEN FOX


A hungry Fox found in a hollow tree a quantity of bread and meat, which some shepherds had placed there against their return. Delighted with his find he slipped in through the narrow aperture and greedily devoured it all. But when he tried to get out again he found himself so swollen after his big meal that he could not squeeze through the hole, and fell to whining and groaning over his misfortune. Another Fox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter was; and, on learning the state of the case, said, “Well, my friend, I see nothing for it but for you to stay where you are till you shrink to your former size; you'll get out then easily enough.”





The Quack Frog





THE MOUSE, THE FROG, AND THE HAWK


A Mouse and a Frog struck up a friendship; they were not well mated, for the Mouse lived entirely on land, while the Frog was equally at home on land or in the water. In order that they might never be separated, the Frog tied himself and the Mouse together by the leg with a piece of thread. As long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well; but, coming to the edge of a pool, the Frog jumped in, taking the Mouse with him, and began swimming about and croaking with pleasure. The unhappy Mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake of the Frog. There he was spied by a Hawk, who pounced down on him and seized him in his talons. The Frog was unable to loose the knot which bound him to the Mouse, and thus was carried off along with him and eaten by the Hawk.





THE BOY AND THE NETTLES


A Boy was gathering berries from a hedge when his hand was stung by a Nettle. Smarting with the pain, he ran to tell his mother, and said to her between his sobs, “I only touched it ever so lightly, mother.” “That's just why you got stung, my son,” she said, “if you had grasped it firmly, it wouldn't have hurt you in the least.”





THE PEASANT AND THE APPLE-TREE


A Peasant had an Apple-tree growing in his garden, which bore no fruit, but merely served to provide a shelter from the heat for the sparrows and grasshoppers which sat and chirped in its branches. Disappointed at its barrenness he determined to cut it down, and went and fetched his axe for the purpose. But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, “If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek shelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to enliven your work in the garden.” He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cut through the trunk. A few strokes showed that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large store of honey. Delighted with his find he threw down his axe, saying, “The old tree is worth keeping after all.”

Utility is most men's test of worth.





THE JACKDAW AND THE PIGEONS


A Jackdaw, watching some Pigeons in a farmyard, was filled with envy when he saw how well they were fed, and determined to disguise himself as one of them, in order to secure a share of the good things they enjoyed. So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the flock; and, so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he was not a pigeon like themselves. But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering, when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifully that he was glad to escape and join his own kind again. But the other jackdaws did not recognise him in his white dress, and would not let him feed with them, but drove him away: and so he became a homeless wanderer for his pains.





JUPITER AND THE TORTOISE


Jupiter was about to marry a wife, and determined to celebrate the event by inviting all the animals to a banquet. They all came except the Tortoise, who did not put in an appearance, much to Jupiter's surprise. So when he next saw the Tortoise he asked him why he had not been at the banquet. “I don't care for going out,” said the Tortoise, “there's no place like home.” Jupiter was so much annoyed by this reply that he decreed that from that time forth the Tortoise should carry his house upon his back, and never be able to get away from home even if he wished to.





THE DOG IN THE MANGER


A Dog was lying in a Manger on the hay which had been put there for the cattle, and when they came and tried to eat, he growled and snapped at them and wouldn't let them get at their food. “What a selfish beast,” said one of them to his companions, “he can't eat himself and yet he won't let those eat who can.”





THE TWO BAGS


Every man carries Two Bags about with him, one in front and one behind, and both are packed full of faults. The Bag in front contains his neighbours' faults, the one behind his own. Hence it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to see those of others.





THE OXEN AND THE AXLETREES


A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded waggon along the highway, and, as they tugged and strained at the yoke, the Axletrees creaked and groaned terribly. This was too much for the Oxen, who turned round indignantly and said, “Hullo, you there! Why do you make such a noise when we do all the work?”

They complain most who suffer least.





The Dog in the Manger





THE BOY AND THE FILBERTS


A Boy put his hand into a jar of Filberts, and grasped as many as his fist could possibly hold. But when he tried to pull it out again, he found he couldn't do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to allow of the passage of so large a handful. Unwilling to lose his nuts but unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears. A bystander, who saw where the trouble lay, said to him, “Come, my boy, don't be so greedy: be content with half the amount, and you'll be able to get your hand out without difficulty.”

Do not attempt too much at once.





THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING


Time was when the Frogs were discontented because they had no one to rule over them: so they sent a deputation to Jupiter to ask him to give them a King. Jupiter, despising the folly of their request, cast a log into the pool where they lived, and said that that should be their King. The Frogs were terrified at first by the splash, and scuttled away into the deepest parts of the pool; but by and by, when they saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to the surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel such contempt for it that they even took to sitting upon it. Thinking that a King of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to Jupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King he had given them, and to give them another and a better one. Jupiter, annoyed at being pestered in this way, sent a Stork to rule over them, who no sooner arrived among them than he began to catch and eat the Frogs as fast as he could.





THE OLIVE-TREE AND THE FIG-TREE


An Olive-tree taunted a Fig-tree with the loss of her leaves at a certain season of the year. “You,” she said, “lose your leaves every autumn, and are bare till the spring: whereas I, as you see, remain green and flourishing all the year round.” Soon afterwards there came a heavy fall of snow, which settled on the leaves of the Olive so that she bent and broke under the weight; but the flakes fell harmlessly through the bare branches of the Fig, which survived to bear many another crop.





THE LION AND THE BOAR


One hot and thirsty day in the height of summer a Lion and a Boar came down to a little spring at the same moment to drink. In a trice they were quarrelling as to who should drink first. The quarrel soon became a fight and they attacked one another with the utmost fury. Presently, stopping for a moment to take breath, they saw some vultures seated on a rock above evidently waiting for one of them to be killed, when they would fly down and feed upon the carcase. The sight sobered them at once, and they made up their quarrel, saying, “We had much better be friends than fight and be eaten by vultures.”





The Frogs Asking for a King





THE WALNUT-TREE


A Walnut-tree, which grew by the roadside, bore every year a plentiful crop of nuts. Every one who passed by pelted its branches with sticks and stones, in order to bring down the fruit, and the tree suffered severely. “It is hard,” it cried, “that the very persons who enjoy my fruit should thus reward me with insults and blows.”





THE MAN AND THE LION


A Man and a Lion were companions on a journey, and in the course of conversation they began to boast about their prowess, and each claimed to be superior to the other in strength and courage. They were still arguing with some heat when they came to a cross-road where there was a statue of a Man strangling a Lion. “There!” said the Man triumphantly, “look at that! Doesn't that prove to you that we are stronger than you?” “Not so fast, my friend,” said the Lion, “that is only your view of the case. If we Lions could make statues, you may be sure that in most of them you would see the Man underneath.”

There are two sides to every question.





THE TORTOISE AND THE EAGLE


A Tortoise, discontented with his lowly life, and envious of the birds he saw disporting themselves in the air, begged an Eagle to teach him to fly. The Eagle protested that it was idle for him to try, as nature had not provided him with wings; but the Tortoise pressed him with entreaties and promises of treasure, insisting that it could only be a question of learning the craft of the air. So at length the Eagle consented to do the best he could for him, and picked him up in his talons. Soaring with him to a great height in the sky he then let him go, and the wretched Tortoise fell headlong and was dashed to pieces on a rock.





THE KID ON THE HOUSETOP


A Kid climbed up on to the roof of an outhouse, attracted by the grass and other things that grew in the thatch; and as he stood there browsing away, he caught sight of a Wolf passing below, and jeered at him because he couldn't reach him. The Wolf only looked up and said, “I hear you, my young friend; but it is not you who mock me, but the roof on which you are standing.”





THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL


A fox once fell into a trap, and after a struggle managed to get free, but with the loss of his brush. He was then so much ashamed of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless he could persuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also, and thus divert attention from his own loss. So he called a meeting of all the Foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails: “They're ugly things anyhow,” he said, “and besides they're heavy, and it's tiresome to be always carrying them about with you.” But one of the other Foxes said, “My friend, if you hadn't lost your own tail, you wouldn't be so keen on getting us to cut off ours.”





THE VAIN JACKDAW


Jupiter announced that he intended to appoint a king over the birds, and named a day on which they were to appear before his throne, when he would select the most beautiful of them all to be their ruler. Wishing to look their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks of a stream, where they busied themselves in washing and preening their feathers. The Jackdaw was there along with the rest, and realised that, with his ugly plumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was: so he waited till they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the feathers they had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the result that he looked gayer than any of them. When the appointed day came, the birds assembled before Jupiter's throne; and, after passing them in review, he was about to make the Jackdaw king, when all the rest set upon the king-elect, stripped him of his borrowed plumes, and exposed him for the Jackdaw that he was.





THE TRAVELLER AND HIS DOG


A Traveller was about to start on a journey, and said to his Dog, who was stretching himself by the door, “Come, what are you yawning for? Hurry up and get ready: I mean you to go with me.” But the Dog merely wagged his tail and said quietly, “I'm ready, master: it's you I'm waiting for.”





THE SHIPWRECKED MAN AND THE SEA


A Shipwrecked Man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his struggle with the waves. When he woke up, he bitterly reproached the Sea for its treachery in enticing men with its smooth and smiling surface, and then, when they were well embarked, turning in fury upon them and sending both ship and sailors to destruction. The Sea arose in the form of a woman, and replied, “Lay not the blame on me, O sailor, but on the Winds. By nature I am as calm and safe as the land itself: but the Winds fall upon me with their gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to me.”





THE WILD BOAR AND THE FOX


A Wild Boar was engaged in whetting his tusks upon the trunk of a tree in the forest when a Fox came by and, seeing what he was at, said to him, “Why are you doing that, pray? The huntsmen are not out to-day, and there are no other dangers at hand that I can see.” “True, my friend,” replied the Boar, “but the instant my life is in danger I shall need to use my tusks. There'll be no time to sharpen them then.”





MERCURY AND THE SCULPTOR


Mercury was very anxious to know in what estimation he was held by mankind; so he disguised himself as a man and walked into a Sculptor's studio, where there were a number of statues finished and ready for sale. Seeing a statue of Jupiter among the rest, he inquired the price of it. “A crown,” said the Sculptor. “Is that all?” said he, laughing; “and” (pointing to one of Juno) “how much is that one?” “That,” was the reply, “is half a crown.” “And how much might you be wanting for that one over there, now?” he continued, pointing to a statue of himself. “That one?” said the Sculptor, “Oh, I'll throw him in for nothing if you'll buy the other two.”





The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea





THE FAWN AND HIS MOTHER


A Hind said to her Fawn, who was now well grown and strong, “My son, Nature has given you a powerful body and a stout pair of horns, and I can't think why you are such a coward as to run away from the hounds.” Just then they both heard the sound of a pack in full cry, but at a considerable distance. “You stay where you are,” said the Hind; “never mind me;” and with that she ran off as fast as her legs could carry her.





THE FOX AND THE LION


A Fox who had never seen a Lion one day met one, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he was ready to die with fear. After a time he met him again, and was still rather frightened, but not nearly so much as he had been when he met him first. But when he saw him for the third time he was so far from being afraid that he went up to him and began to talk to him as if he had known him all his life.





THE EAGLE AND HIS CAPTOR


A Man once caught an Eagle, and after clipping his wings turned him loose among the fowls in his hen-house, where he moped in a corner, looking very dejected and forlorn. After a while his Captor was glad enough to sell him to a neighbour, who took him home and let his wings grow again. As soon as he had recovered the use of them, the Eagle flew out and caught a hare, which he brought home and presented to his benefactor. A fox observed this, and said to the Eagle, “Don't waste your gifts on him! Go and give them to the man who first caught you; make him your friend, and then perhaps he won't catch you and clip your wings a second time.”





THE BLACKSMITH AND HIS DOG


A Blacksmith had a little Dog, which used to sleep when his master was at work, but was very wide awake indeed when it was time for meals. One day his master pretended to be disgusted at this, and when he had thrown him a bone as usual, he said: “What on earth is the good of a lazy cur like you? When I am hammering away at my anvil, you just curl up and go to sleep: but no sooner do I stop for a mouthful of food than you wake up and wag your tail to be fed.”

Those who will not work deserve to starve.





THE STAG AT THE POOL


A thirsty Stag went down to a pool to drink. As he bent over the surface he saw his own reflection in the water, and was struck with admiration for his fine spreading antlers, but at the same time he felt nothing but disgust for the weakness and slenderness of his legs. While he stood there looking at himself, he was seen and attacked by a Lion; but in the chase which ensued, he soon drew away from his pursuer, and kept his lead as long as the ground over which he ran was open and free of trees. But coming presently to a wood, he was caught by his antlers in the branches, and fell a victim to the teeth and claws of his enemy. “Woe is me!” he cried with his last breath, “I despised my legs, which might have saved my life: but I gloried in my horns, and they have proved my ruin.”

What is worth most is often valued least.





THE DOG AND THE SHADOW


A Dog was crossing a plank bridge over a stream with a piece of meat in his mouth, when he happened to see his own reflection in the water. He thought it was another dog with a piece of meat twice as big; so he let go his own, and flew at the other dog to get the larger piece. But, of course, all that happened was that he got neither; for one was only a shadow, and the other was carried away by the current.





MERCURY AND THE TRADESMEN


When Jupiter was creating man, he told Mercury to make an infusion of lies, and to add a little of it to the other ingredients which went to the making of the Tradesmen. Mercury did so, and introduced an equal amount into each in turn—the tallow-chandler, and the greengrocer, and the haberdasher, and all, till he came to the horse-dealer, who was last on the list, when, finding that he had a quantity of the infusion still left, he put it all into him. This is why all Tradesmen lie more or less, but they none of them lie like a horse-dealer.





The Dog and the Shadow





THE MICE AND THE WEASELS


There was war between the Mice and the Weasels, in which the Mice always got the worst of it, numbers of them being killed and eaten by the Weasels. So they called a council of war, in which an old Mouse got up and said, “It's no wonder we are always beaten, for we have no generals to plan our battles and direct our movements in the field.” Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest Mice to be their leaders, and these, in order to be distinguished from the rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw. They then led out the Mice to battle, confident of victory: but they were defeated as usual, and were soon scampering as fast as they could to their holes. All made their way to safety without difficulty except the leaders, who were so hampered by the badges of their rank that they could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims to their pursuers.

Greatness carries its own penalties.





THE PEACOCK AND JUNO


The Peacock was greatly discontented because he had not a beautiful voice like the nightingale, and he went and complained to Juno about it. “The nightingale's song,” said he, “is the envy of all the birds; but whenever I utter a sound I become a laughing-stock.” The goddess tried to console him by saying, “You have not, it is true, the power of song, but then you far excel all the rest in beauty: your neck flashes like the emerald and your splendid tail is a marvel of gorgeous colour.” But the Peacock was not appeased. “What is the use,” said he, “of being beautiful, with a voice like mine?” Then Juno replied, with a shade of sternness in her tones, “Fate has allotted to all their destined gifts: to yourself beauty, to the eagle strength, to the nightingale song, and so on to all the rest in their degree; but you alone are dissatisfied with your portion. Make, then, no more complaints. For, if your present wish were granted, you would quickly find cause for fresh discontent.”





THE BEAR AND THE FOX


A Bear was once bragging about his generous feelings, and saying how refined he was compared with other animals. (There is, in fact, a tradition that a Bear will never touch a dead body.) A Fox, who heard him talking in this strain, smiled and said, “My friend, when you are hungry, I only wish you would confine your attention to the dead and leave the living alone.”

A hypocrite deceives no one but himself.





THE ASS AND THE OLD PEASANT


An old Peasant was sitting in a meadow watching his Ass, which was grazing close by, when all of a sudden he caught sight of armed men stealthily approaching. He jumped up in a moment, and begged the Ass to fly with him as fast as he could, “Or else,” said he, “we shall both be captured by the enemy.” But the Ass just looked round lazily and said, “And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads than I have to now?” “No!” said his master. “Oh, well, then,” said the Ass, “I don't mind if they do take me, for I shan't be any worse off.”





THE OX AND THE FROG


Two little Frogs were playing about at the edge of a pool when an Ox came down to the water to drink, and by accident trod on one of them and crushed the life out of him. When the old Frog missed him, she asked his brother where he was. “He is dead, mother,” said the little Frog, “an enormous big creature with four legs came to our pool this morning and trampled him down in the mud.” “Enormous, was he? Was he as big as this?” said the Frog, puffing herself out to look as big as possible. “Oh! yes, much bigger,” was the answer. The Frog puffed herself out still more. “Was he as big as this?” said she. “Oh! yes, yes, mother, MUCH bigger,” said the little Frog. And yet again she puffed and puffed herself out till she was almost as round as a ball. “As big as…?” she began—but then she burst.





The Ox and the Frog





THE MAN AND THE IMAGE


A poor Man had a wooden Image of a god, to which he used to pray daily for riches. He did this for a long time, but remained as poor as ever, till one day he caught up the Image in disgust and hurled it with all his strength against the wall. The force of the blow split open the head and a quantity of gold coins fell out upon the floor. The Man gathered them up greedily, and said, “O you old fraud, you! When I honoured you, you did me no good whatever: but no sooner do I treat you to insults and violence than you make a rich man of me!”





HERCULES AND THE WAGGONER


A Waggoner was driving his team along a muddy lane with a full load behind them, when the wheels of his waggon sank so deep in the mire that no efforts of his horses could move them. As he stood there, looking helplessly on, and calling loudly at intervals upon Hercules for assistance, the god himself appeared, and said to him, “Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and goad on your horses, and then you may call on Hercules to assist you. If you won't lift a finger to help yourself, you can't expect Hercules or any one else to come to your aid.”

Heaven helps those who help themselves.





THE POMEGRANATE, THE APPLE-TREE, AND THE BRAMBLE


A Pomegranate and an Apple-tree were disputing about the quality of their fruits, and each claimed that its own was the better of the two. High words passed between them, and a violent quarrel was imminent, when a Bramble impudently poked its head out of a neighbouring hedge and said, “There, that's enough, my friends; don't let us quarrel.”





THE LION, THE BEAR, AND THE FOX


A Lion and a Bear were fighting for possession of a kid, which they had both seized at the same moment. The battle was long and fierce, and at length both of them were exhausted, and lay upon the ground severely wounded and gasping for breath. A Fox had all the time been prowling round and watching the fight: and when he saw the combatants lying there too weak to move, he slipped in and seized the kid, and ran off with it. They looked on helplessly, and one said to the other, “Here we've been mauling each other all this while, and no one the better for it except the Fox!”





THE BLACKAMOOR


A Man once bought an Ethiopian slave, who had a black skin like all Ethiopians; but his new master thought his colour was due to his late owner's having neglected him, and that all he wanted was a good scrubbing. So he set to work with plenty of soap and hot water, and rubbed away at him with a will, but all to no purpose: his skin remained as black as ever, while the poor wretch all but died from the cold he caught.





THE TWO SOLDIERS AND THE ROBBER


Two Soldiers travelling together were set upon by a Robber. One of them ran away, but the other stood his ground, and laid about him so lustily with his sword that the Robber was fain to fly and leave him in peace. When the coast was clear the timid one ran back, and, flourishing his weapon, cried in a threatening voice, “Where is he? Let me get at him, and I'll soon let him know whom he's got to deal with.” But the other replied, “You are a little late, my friend: I only wish you had backed me up just now, even if you had done no more than speak, for I should have been encouraged, believing your words to be true. As it is, calm yourself, and put up your sword: there is no further use for it. You may delude others into thinking you're as brave as a lion: but I know that, at the first sign of danger, you run away like a hare.”





The Blackamoor





THE LION AND THE WILD ASS


A Lion and a Wild Ass went out hunting together: the latter was to run down the prey by his superior speed, and the former would then come up and despatch it. They met with great success; and when it came to sharing the spoil the Lion divided it all into three equal portions. “I will take the first,” said he, “because I am King of the beasts; I will also take the second, because, as your partner, I am entitled to half of what remains; and as for the third—well, unless you give it up to me and take yourself off pretty quick, the third, believe me, will make you feel very sorry for yourself!”

Might makes right.





THE MAN AND THE SATYR


A Man and a Satyr became friends, and determined to live together. All went well for a while, until one day in winter-time the Satyr saw the Man blowing on his hands. “Why do you do that?” he asked. “To warm my hands,” said the Man. That same day, when they sat down to supper together, they each had a steaming hot bowl of porridge, and the Man raised his bowl to his mouth and blew on it. “Why do you do that?” asked the Satyr. “To cool my porridge,” said the Man. The Satyr got up from the table. “Good-bye,” said he, “I'm going: I can't be friends with a man who blows hot and cold with the same breath.”





THE IMAGE-SELLER


A certain man made a wooden Image of Mercury, and exposed it for sale in the market. As no one offered to buy it, however, he thought he would try to attract a purchaser by proclaiming the virtues of the Image. So he cried up and down the market, “A god for sale! a god for sale! One who'll bring you luck and keep you lucky!” Presently one of the bystanders stopped him and said, “If your god is all you make him out to be, how is it you don't keep him and make the most of him yourself?” “I'll tell you why,” replied he; “he brings gain, it is true, but he takes his time about it; whereas I want money at once.”





The Man and the Satyr





THE EAGLE AND THE ARROW


An Eagle sat perched on a lofty rock, keeping a sharp look-out for prey. A huntsman, concealed in a cleft of the mountain and on the watch for game, spied him there and shot an Arrow at him. The shaft struck him full in the breast and pierced him through and through. As he lay in the agonies of death, he turned his eyes upon the Arrow. “Ah! cruel fate!” he cried, “that I should perish thus: but oh! Fate more cruel still, that the Arrow which kills me should be winged with an Eagle's feathers!”





THE RICH MAN AND THE TANNER


A Rich Man took up his residence next door to a Tanner, and found the smell of the tan-yard so extremely unpleasant that he told him he must go. The Tanner delayed his departure, and the Rich Man had to speak to him several times about it; and every time the Tanner said he was making arrangements to move very shortly. This went on for some time, till at last the Rich Man got so used to the smell that he ceased to mind it, and troubled the Tanner with his objections no more.





THE WOLF, THE MOTHER, AND HER CHILD


A hungry Wolf was prowling about in search of food. By and by, attracted by the cries of a Child, he came to a cottage. As he crouched beneath the window, he heard the Mother say to the Child, “Stop crying, do! or I'll throw you to the Wolf.” Thinking she really meant what she said, he waited there a long time in the expectation of satisfying his hunger. In the evening he heard the Mother fondling her Child and saying, “If the naughty Wolf comes, he shan't get my little one: Daddy will kill him.” The Wolf got up in much disgust and walked away: “As for the people in that house,” said he to himself, “you can't believe a word they say.”





THE OLD WOMAN AND THE WINE-JAR


An old Woman picked up an empty Wine-jar which had once contained a rare and costly wine, and which still retained some traces of its exquisite bouquet. She raised it to her nose and sniffed at it again and again. “Ah,” she cried, “how delicious must have been the liquid which has left behind so ravishing a smell.”





THE LIONESS AND THE VIXEN


A Lioness and a Vixen were talking together about their young, as mothers will, and saying how healthy and well-grown they were, and what beautiful coats they had, and how they were the image of their parents. “My litter of cubs is a joy to see,” said the Fox; and then she added, rather maliciously, “But I notice you never have more than one.” “No,” said the Lioness grimly, “but that one's a lion.”

Quality, not quantity.





THE VIPER AND THE FILE


A Viper entered a carpenter's shop, and went from one to another of the tools, begging for something to eat. Among the rest, he addressed himself to the File, and asked for the favour of a meal. The File replied in a tone of pitying contempt, “What a simpleton you must be if you imagine you will get anything from me, who invariably take from every one and never give anything in return.”

The covetous are poor givers.





THE CAT AND THE COCK


A Cat pounced on a Cock, and cast about for some good excuse for making a meal off him, for Cats don't as a rule eat Cocks, and she knew she ought not to. At last she said, “You make a great nuisance of yourself at night by crowing and keeping people awake: so I am going to make an end of you.” But the Cock defended himself by saying that he crowed in order that men might wake up and set about the day's work in good time, and that they really couldn't very well do without him. “That may be,” said the Cat, “but whether they can or not, I'm not going without my dinner.” And she killed and ate him.

The want of a good excuse never kept a villain from crime.





THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE


A Hare was one day making fun of a Tortoise for being so slow upon his feet. “Wait a bit,” said the Tortoise, “I'll run a race with you, and I'll wager that I win.” “Oh, well,” replied the Hare, who was much amused at the idea, “let's try and see;” and it was soon agreed that the fox should set a course for them, and be the judge. When the time came both started off together, but the Hare was soon so far ahead that he thought he might as well have a rest: so down he lay and fell fast asleep. Meanwhile the Tortoise kept plodding on, and in time reached the goal. At last the Hare woke up with a start, and dashed on at his fastest, but only to find that the Tortoise had already won the race.

Slow and steady wins the race.





THE SOLDIER AND HIS HORSE


A Soldier gave his Horse a plentiful supply of oats in time of war, and tended him with the utmost care, for he wished him to be strong to endure the hardships of the field, and swift to bear his master, when need arose, out of the reach of danger. But when the war was over he employed him on all sorts of drudgery, bestowing but little attention upon him, and giving him, moreover, nothing but chaff to eat. The time came when war broke out again, and the Soldier saddled and bridled his Horse, and, having put on his heavy coat of mail, mounted him to ride off and take the field. But the poor half-starved beast sank down under his weight, and said to his rider, “You will have to go into battle on foot this time. Thanks to hard work and bad food, you have turned me from a Horse into an ass; and you cannot in a moment turn me back again into a Horse.”





THE OXEN AND THE BUTCHERS


Once upon a time the Oxen determined to be revenged upon the Butchers for the havoc they wrought in their ranks, and plotted to put them to death on a given day. They were all gathered together discussing how best to carry out the plan, and the more violent of them were engaged in sharpening their horns for the fray, when an old Ox got up upon his feet and said, “My brothers, you have good reason, I know, to hate these Butchers, but, at any rate, they understand their trade and do what they have to do without causing unnecessary pain. But if we kill them, others, who have no experience, will be set to slaughter us, and will by their bungling inflict great sufferings upon us. For you may be sure that, even though all the Butchers perish, mankind will never go without their beef.”





THE WOLF AND THE LION


A wolf stole a lamb from the flock, and was carrying it off to devour it at his leisure when he met a Lion, who took his prey away from him and walked off with it. He dared not resist, but when the Lion had gone some distance he said, “It is most unjust of you to take what's mine away from me like that.” The Lion laughed and called out in reply, “It was justly yours, no doubt! The gift of a friend, perhaps, eh?”





THE SHEEP, THE WOLF, AND THE STAG


A Stag once asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, saying that his friend the Wolf would be his surety. The Sheep, however, was afraid that they meant to cheat her; so she excused herself, saying, “The Wolf is in the habit of seizing what he wants and running off with it without paying, and you, too, can run much faster than I. So how shall I be able to come up with either of you when the debt falls due?”

Two blacks do not make a white.





THE LION AND THE THREE BULLS


Three Bulls were grazing in a meadow, and were watched by a Lion, who longed to capture and devour them, but who felt that he was no match for the three so long as they kept together. So he began by false whispers and malicious hints to foment jealousies and distrust among them. This stratagem succeeded so well that ere long the Bulls grew cold and unfriendly, and finally avoided each other and fed each one by himself apart. No sooner did the Lion see this than he fell upon them one by one and killed them in turn.

The quarrels of friends are the opportunities of foes.





THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER


A Young Man, who fancied himself something of a horseman, mounted a Horse which had not been properly broken in, and was exceedingly difficult to control. No sooner did the Horse feel his weight in the saddle than he bolted, and nothing would stop him. A friend of the Rider's met him in the road in his headlong career, and called out, “Where are you off to in such a hurry?” To which he, pointing to the Horse, replied, “I've no idea: ask him.”





THE GOAT AND THE VINE


A Goat was straying in a vineyard, and began to browse on the tender shoots of a Vine which bore several fine bunches of grapes. “What have I done to you,” said the Vine, “that you should harm me thus? Isn't there grass enough for you to feed on? All the same, even if you eat up every leaf I have, and leave me quite bare, I shall produce wine enough to pour over you when you are led to the altar to be sacrificed.”





The Goat and the Vine





THE TWO POTS


Two Pots, one of earthenware and the other of brass, were carried away down a river in flood. The Brazen Pot urged his companion to keep close by his side, and he would protect him. The other thanked him, but begged him not to come near him on any account: “For that,” he said, “is just what I am most afraid of. One touch from you and I should be broken in pieces.”

Equals make the best friends.





THE OLD HOUND


A Hound who had served his master well for years, and had run down many a quarry in his time, began to lose his strength and speed owing to age. One day, when out hunting, his master started a powerful wild boar and set the Hound at him. The latter seized the beast by the ear, but his teeth were gone and he could not retain his hold; so the boar escaped. His master began to scold him severely, but the Hound interrupted him with these words: “My will is as strong as ever, master, but my body is old and feeble. You ought to honour me for what I have been instead of abusing me for what I am.”





The Two Pots





THE CLOWN AND THE COUNTRYMAN


A Nobleman announced his intention of giving a public entertainment in the theatre, and offered splendid prizes to all who had any novelty to exhibit at the performance. The announcement attracted a crowd of conjurers, jugglers, and acrobats, and among the rest a Clown, very popular with the crowd, who let it be known that he was going to give an entirely new turn. When the day of the performance came, the theatre was filled from top to bottom some time before the entertainment began. Several performers exhibited their tricks, and then the popular favourite came on empty-handed and alone. At once there was a hush of expectation: and he, letting his head fall upon his breast, imitated the squeak of a pig to such perfection that the audience insisted on his producing the animal, which, they said, he must have somewhere concealed about his person. He, however, convinced them that there was no pig there, and then the applause was deafening. Among the spectators was a Countryman, who disparaged the Clown's performance and announced that he would give a much superior exhibition of the same trick on the following day. Again the theatre was filled to overflowing, and again the Clown gave his imitation amidst the cheers of the crowd. The Countryman, meanwhile, before going on the stage, had secreted a young porker under his smock; and when the spectators derisively bade him do better if he could, he gave it a pinch in the ear and made it squeal loudly. But they all with one voice shouted out that the Clown's imitation was much more true to life. Thereupon he produced the pig from under his smock and said sarcastically, “There, that shows what sort of judges you are!”





THE LARK AND THE FARMER


A Lark nested in a field of corn, and was rearing her brood under cover of the ripening grain. One day, before the young were fully fledged, the Farmer came to look at the crop, and, finding it yellowing fast, he said, “I must send round word to my neighbours to come and help me reap this field.” One of the young Larks overheard him, and was very much frightened, and asked her mother whether they hadn't better move house at once. “There's no hurry,” replied she; “a man who looks to his friends for help will take his time about a thing.” In a few days the Farmer came by again, and saw that the grain was overripe and falling out of the ears upon the ground. “I must put it off no longer,” he said; “this very day I'll hire the men and set them to work at once.” The Lark heard him and said to her young, “Come, my children, we must be off: he talks no more of his friends now, but is going to take things in hand himself.”

Self-help is the best help.





THE LION AND THE ASS


A Lion and an Ass set up as partners and went a-hunting together. In course of time they came to a cave in which there were a number of wild goats. The Lion took up his stand at the mouth of the cave, and waited for them to come out; while the Ass went inside and brayed for all he was worth in order to frighten them out into the open. The Lion struck them down one by one as they appeared; and when the cave was empty the Ass came out and said, “Well, I scared them pretty well, didn't I?” “I should think you did,” said the Lion: “why, if I hadn't known you were an Ass, I should have turned and run myself.”





THE PROPHET


A Prophet sat in the market-place and told the fortunes of all who cared to engage his services. Suddenly there came running up one who told him that his house had been broken into by thieves, and that they had made off with everything they could lay hands on. He was up in a moment, and rushed off, tearing his hair and calling down curses on the miscreants. The bystanders were much amused, and one of them said, “Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others, but it seems he's not clever enough to perceive what's in store for himself.”





THE HOUND AND THE HARE


A young Hound started a Hare, and, when he caught her up, would at one moment snap at her with his teeth as though he were about to kill her, while at another he would let go his hold and frisk about her, as if he were playing with another dog. At last the Hare said, “I wish you would show yourself in your true colours! If you are my friend, why do you bite me? If you are my enemy, why do you play with me?”

He is no friend who plays double.





THE LION, THE MOUSE, AND THE FOX


A Lion was lying asleep at the mouth of his den when a Mouse ran over his back and tickled him so that he woke up with a start and began looking about everywhere to see what it was that had disturbed him. A Fox, who was looking on, thought he would have a joke at the expense of the Lion; so he said, “Well, this is the first time I've seen a Lion afraid of a Mouse.” “Afraid of a Mouse?” said the Lion testily, “not I! It's his bad manners I can't stand.”





THE TRUMPETER TAKEN PRISONER


A Trumpeter marched into battle in the van of the army and put courage into his comrades by his warlike tunes. Being captured by the enemy, he begged for his life, and said, “Do not put me to death; I have killed no one: indeed, I have no weapons, but carry with me only my trumpet here.” But his captors replied, “That is only the more reason why we should take your life; for, though you do not fight yourself, you stir up others to do so.”





THE WOLF AND THE CRANE


A Wolf once got a bone stuck in his throat. So he went to a Crane and begged her to put her long bill down his throat and pull it out. “I'll make it worth your while,” he added. The Crane did as she was asked, and got the bone out quite easily. The Wolf thanked her warmly, and was just turning away, when she cried, “What about that fee of mine?” “Well, what about it?” snapped the Wolf, baring his teeth as he spoke; “you can go about boasting that you once put your head into a Wolf's mouth and didn't get it bitten off. What more do you want?”





THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE WILD SOW


An Eagle built her nest at the top of a high tree; a Cat with her family occupied a hollow in the trunk half-way down; and a Wild Sow and her young took up their quarters at the foot. They might have got on very well as neighbours had it not been for the evil cunning of the Cat. Climbing up to the Eagle's nest she said to the Eagle, “You and I are in the greatest possible danger. That dreadful creature, the Sow, who is always to be seen grubbing away at the foot of the tree, means to uproot it, that she may devour your family and mine at her ease.” Having thus driven the Eagle almost out of her senses with terror, the Cat climbed down the tree, and said to the Sow, “I must warn you against that dreadful bird, the Eagle. She is only waiting her chance to fly down and carry off one of your little pigs when you take them out, to feed her brood with.” She succeeded in frightening the Sow as much as the Eagle. Then she returned to her hole in the trunk, from which, feigning to be afraid, she never came forth by day. Only by night did she creep out unseen to procure food for her kittens. The Eagle, meanwhile was afraid to stir from her nest, and the Sow dared not leave her home among the roots: so that in time both they and their families perished of hunger, and their dead bodies supplied the Cat with ample food for her growing family.





The Wolf and the Crane





THE WOLF AND THE SHEEP


A Wolf was worried and badly bitten by dogs, and lay a long time for dead. By and by he began to revive, and, feeling very hungry, called out to a passing Sheep and said, “Would you kindly bring me some water from the stream close by? I can manage about meat, if only I could get something to drink.” But this Sheep was no fool. “I can quite understand”, said he, “that if I brought you the water, you would have no difficulty about the meat. Good-morning.”





THE TUNNY-FISH AND THE DOLPHIN


A Tunny-fish was chased by a Dolphin and splashed through the water at a great rate, but the Dolphin gradually gained upon him, and was just about to seize him when the force of his flight carried the Tunny on to a sandbank. In the heat of the chase the Dolphin followed him, and there they both lay out of the water, gasping for dear life. When the Tunny saw that his enemy was doomed like himself, he said, “I don't mind having to die now: for I see that he who is the cause of my death is about to share the same fate.”





THE THREE TRADESMEN


The citizens of a certain city were debating about the best material to use in the fortifications which were about to be erected for the greater security of the town. A Carpenter got up and advised the use of wood, which he said was readily procurable and easily worked. A Stone-mason objected to wood on the ground that it was so inflammable, and recommended stones instead. Then a Tanner got on his legs and said, “In my opinion there's nothing like leather.”

Every man for himself.





THE MOUSE AND THE BULL


A Bull gave chase to a Mouse which had bitten him in the nose: but the Mouse was too quick for him and slipped into a hole in a wall. The Bull charged furiously into the wall again and again until he was tired out, and sank down on the ground exhausted with his efforts. When all was quiet, the Mouse darted out and bit him again. Beside himself with rage he started to his feet, but by that time the Mouse was back in his hole again, and he could do nothing but bellow and fume in helpless anger. Presently he heard a shrill little voice say from inside the wall, “You big fellows don't always have it your own way, you see: sometimes we little ones come off best.”

The battle is not always to the strong.





THE HARE AND THE HOUND


A Hound started a Hare from her form, and pursued her for some distance; but as she gradually gained upon him, he gave up the chase. A rustic who had seen the race met the Hound as he was returning, and taunted him with his defeat. “The little one was too much for you,” said he. “Ah, well,” said the Hound, “don't forget it's one thing to be running for your dinner, but quite another to be running for your life.”





THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE


A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were acquaintances, and the Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came, and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots, the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour. The fare was not much to the taste of the guest, and presently he broke out with: “My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me, and I promise you you shall live on the fat of the land.” So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him, and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates. The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it, and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided: but before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again; but some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. “Good-bye,” said he, “I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers; whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace.”





THE LION AND THE BULL


A Lion saw a fine fat Bull pasturing among a herd of cattle and cast about for some means of getting him into his clutches; so he sent him word that he was sacrificing a sheep, and asked if he would do him the honour of dining with him. The Bull accepted the invitation, but, on arriving at the Lion's den, he saw a great array of saucepans and spits, but no sign of a sheep; so he turned on his heel and walked quietly away. The Lion called after him in an injured tone to ask the reason, and the Bull turned round and said, “I have reason enough. When I saw all your preparations it struck me at once that the victim was to be a Bull and not a sheep.”

The net is spread in vain in sight of the bird.





THE WOLF, THE FOX, AND THE APE


A Wolf charged a Fox with theft, which he denied, and the case was brought before an Ape to be tried. When he had heard the evidence on both sides, the Ape gave judgment as follows: “I do not think,” he said, “that you, O Wolf, ever lost what you claim; but all the same I believe that you, Fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your denials.”

The dishonest get no credit, even if they act honestly.





THE EAGLE AND THE COCKS


There were two Cocks in the same farmyard, and they fought to decide who should be master. When the fight was over, the beaten one went and hid himself in a dark corner; while the victor flew up on to the roof of the stables and crowed lustily. But an Eagle espied him from high up in the sky, and swooped down and carried him off. Forthwith the other Cock came out of his corner and ruled the roost without a rival.

Pride comes before a fall.





THE ESCAPED JACKDAW


A Man caught a Jackdaw and tied a piece of string to one of its legs, and then gave it to his children for a pet. But the Jackdaw didn't at all like having to live with people; so, after a while, when he seemed to have become fairly tame and they didn't watch him so closely, he slipped away and flew back to his old haunts. Unfortunately, the string was still on his leg, and before long it got entangled in the branches of a tree and the Jackdaw couldn't get free, try as he would. He saw it was all up with him, and cried in despair, “Alas, in gaining my freedom I have lost my life.”





THE FARMER AND THE FOX


A Farmer was greatly annoyed by a Fox, which came prowling about his yard at night and carried off his fowls. So he set a trap for him and caught him; and in order to be revenged upon him, he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go. As ill-luck would have it, however, the Fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting. It quickly caught fire and was all burnt up, and the Farmer lost all his harvest.

Revenge is a two-edged sword.





VENUS AND THE CAT


A Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and begged the goddess Venus to change her into a woman. Venus was very gracious about it, and changed her at once into a beautiful maiden, whom the young man fell in love with at first sight and shortly afterwards married. One day Venus thought she would like to see whether the Cat had changed her habits as well as her form; so she let a mouse run loose in the room where they were. Forgetting everything, the young woman had no sooner seen the mouse than up she jumped and was after it like a shot: at which the goddess was so disgusted that she changed her back again into a Cat.





Venus and the Cat





THE CROW AND THE SWAN


A Crow was filled with envy on seeing the beautiful white plumage of a Swan, and thought it was due to the water in which the Swan constantly bathed and swam. So he left the neighbourhood of the altars, where he got his living by picking up bits of the meat offered in sacrifice, and went and lived among the pools and streams. But though he bathed and washed his feathers many times a day, he didn't make them any whiter, and at last died of hunger into the bargain.

You may change your habits, but not your nature.





THE STAG WITH ONE EYE


A Stag, blind of one eye, was grazing close to the sea-shore and kept his sound eye turned towards the land, so as to be able to perceive the approach of the hounds, while the blind eye he turned towards the sea, never suspecting that any danger would threaten him from that quarter. As it fell out, however, some sailors, coasting along the shore, spied him and shot an arrow at him, by which he was mortally wounded. As he lay dying, he said to himself, “Wretch that I am! I bethought me of the dangers of the land, whence none assailed me: but I feared no peril from the sea, yet thence has come my ruin.”

Misfortune often assails us from an unexpected quarter.





THE FLY AND THE DRAUGHT-MULE


A Fly sat on one of the shafts of a cart and said to the Mule who was pulling it, “How slow you are! Do mend your pace, or I shall have to use my sting as a goad.” The Mule was not in the least disturbed. “Behind me, in the cart,” said he, “sits my master. He holds the reins, and flicks me with his whip, and him I obey, but I don't want any of your impertinence. I know when I may dawdle and when I may not.”





THE COCK AND THE JEWEL


A Cock, scratching the ground for something to eat, turned up a Jewel that had by chance been dropped there. “Ho!” said he, “a fine thing you are, no doubt, and, had your owner found you, great would his joy have been. But for me! give me a single grain of corn before all the jewels in the world.”





The Cock and the Jewel





THE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERD


A Wolf hung about near a flock of sheep for a long time, but made no attempt to molest them. The Shepherd at first kept a sharp eye on him, for he naturally thought he meant mischief: but as time went by and the Wolf showed no inclination to meddle with the flock, he began to look upon him more as a protector than as an enemy: and when one day some errand took him to the city, he felt no uneasiness at leaving the Wolf with the sheep. But as soon as his back was turned the Wolf attacked them and killed the greater number. When the Shepherd returned and saw the havoc he had wrought, he cried, “It serves me right for trusting my flock to a Wolf.”





THE FARMER AND THE STORK


A Farmer set some traps in a field which he had lately sown with corn, in order to catch the cranes which came to pick up the seed. When he returned to look at his traps he found several cranes caught, and among them a Stork, which begged to be let go, and said, “You ought not to kill me: I am not a crane, but a Stork, as you can easily see by my feathers, and I am the most honest and harmless of birds.” But the Farmer replied, “It's nothing to me what you are: I find you among these cranes, who ruin my crops, and, like them, you shall suffer.”

If you choose bad companions no one will believe that you are anything but bad yourself.





THE CHARGER AND THE MILLER


A Horse, who had been used to carry his rider into battle, felt himself growing old and chose to work in a mill instead. He now no longer found himself stepping out proudly to the beating of the drums, but was compelled to slave away all day grinding the corn. Bewailing his hard lot, he said one day to the Miller, “Ah me! I was once a splendid war-horse, gaily caparisoned, and attended by a groom whose sole duty was to see to my wants. How different is my present condition! I wish I had never given up the battlefield for the mill.” The Miller replied with asperity, “It's no use your regretting the past. Fortune has many ups and downs: you must just take them as they come.”





THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE OWL


An Owl, who lived in a hollow tree, was in the habit of feeding by night and sleeping by day; but her slumbers were greatly disturbed by the chirping of a Grasshopper, who had taken up his abode in the branches. She begged him repeatedly to have some consideration for her comfort, but the Grasshopper, if anything, only chirped the louder. At last the Owl could stand it no longer, but determined to rid herself of the pest by means of a trick. Addressing herself to the Grasshopper, she said in her pleasantest manner: “As I cannot sleep for your song, which, believe me, is as sweet as the notes of Apollo's lyre, I have a mind to taste some nectar, which Minerva gave me the other day. Won't you come in and join me?” The Grasshopper was flattered by the praise of his song, and his mouth, too, watered at the mention of the delicious drink, so he said he would be delighted. No sooner had he got inside the hollow where the Owl was sitting than she pounced upon him and ate him up.





THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANTS


One fine day in winter some Ants were busy drying their store of corn, which had got rather damp during a long spell of rain. Presently up came a Grasshopper and begged them to spare her a few grains, “For,” she said, “I'm simply starving.” The Ants stopped work for a moment, though this was against their principles. “May we ask,” said they, “what you were doing with yourself all last summer? Why didn't you collect a store of food for the winter?” “The fact is,” replied the Grasshopper, “I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time.” “If you spent the summer singing,” replied the Ants, “you can't do better than spend the winter dancing.” And they chuckled and went on with their work.





THE FARMER AND THE VIPER


One winter a Farmer found a Viper frozen and numb with cold, and out of pity picked it up and placed it in his bosom. The Viper was no sooner revived by the warmth than it turned upon its benefactor and inflicted a fatal bite upon him; and as the poor man lay dying, he cried, “I have only got what I deserved, for taking compassion on so villainous a creature.”

Kindness is thrown away upon the evil.





THE TWO FROGS


Two Frogs were neighbours. One lived in a marsh, where there was plenty of water, which frogs love: the other in a lane some distance away, where all the water to be had was that which lay in the ruts after rain. The Marsh Frog warned his friend and pressed him to come and live with him in the marsh, for he would find his quarters there far more comfortable and—what was still more important—more safe. But the other refused, saying that he could not bring himself to move from a place to which he had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a heavy waggon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under the wheels.





THE COBBLER TURNED DOCTOR


A very unskilful Cobbler, finding himself unable to make a living at his trade, gave up mending boots and took to doctoring instead. He gave out that he had the secret of a universal antidote against all poisons, and acquired no small reputation, thanks to his talent for puffing himself. One day, however, he fell very ill; and the King of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy. Calling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote, and, under pretence of mixing poison with it, added a little water, and commanded him to drink it. Terrified by the fear of being poisoned, the Cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine, and that his antidote was worthless. Then the King summoned his subjects and addressed them as follows: “What folly could be greater than yours? Here is this Cobbler to whom no one will send his boots to be mended, and yet you have not hesitated to entrust him with your lives!”





THE ASS, THE COCK, AND THE LION


An Ass and a Cock were in a cattle-pen together. Presently a Lion, who had been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall upon the Ass and make a meal of him when the Cock, rising to his full height and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow. Now, if there is one thing that frightens a Lion, it is the crowing of a Cock: and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled. The Ass was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the Lion couldn't face a Cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to an Ass: so he ran out and pursued him. But when the two had got well out of sight and hearing of the Cock, the Lion suddenly turned upon the Ass and ate him up.

False confidence often leads to disaster.





THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS


The Members of the Body once rebelled against the Belly. “You,” they said to the Belly, “live in luxury and sloth, and never do a stroke of work; while we not only have to do all the hard work there is to be done, but are actually your slaves and have to minister to all your wants. Now, we will do so no longer, and you can shift for yourself for the future.” They were as good as their word, and left the Belly to starve. The result was just what might have been expected: the whole Body soon began to fail, and the Members and all shared in the general collapse. And then they saw too late how foolish they had been.





THE BALD MAN AND THE FLY


A Fly settled on the head of a Bald Man and bit him. In his eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap. But the Fly escaped, and said to him in derision, “You tried to kill me for just one little bite; what will you do to yourself now, for the heavy smack you have just given yourself?” “Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge,” he replied, “for I never intended myself any harm; but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by sucking human blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!”





THE ASS AND THE WOLF


An Ass was feeding in a meadow, and, catching sight of his enemy the Wolf in the distance, pretended to be very lame and hobbled painfully along. When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass how he came to be so lame, and the Ass replied that in going through a hedge he had trodden on a thorn, and he begged the Wolf to pull it out with his teeth, “In case,” he said, “when you eat me, it should stick in your throat and hurt you very much.” The Wolf said he would, and told the Ass to lift up his foot, and gave his whole mind to getting out the thorn. But the Ass suddenly let out with his heels and fetched the Wolf a fearful kick in the mouth, breaking his teeth; and then he galloped off at full speed. As soon as he could speak the Wolf growled to himself, “It serves me right: my father taught me to kill, and I ought to have stuck to that trade instead of attempting to cure.”





The Bald Man and the Fly





THE MONKEY AND THE CAMEL


At a gathering of all the beasts the Monkey gave an exhibition of dancing and entertained the company vastly. There was great applause at the finish, which excited the envy of the Camel and made him desire to win the favour of the assembly by the same means. So he got up from his place and began dancing, but he cut such a ridiculous figure as he plunged about, and made such a grotesque exhibition of his ungainly person, that the beasts all fell upon him with ridicule and drove him away.





THE SICK MAN AND THE DOCTOR


A Sick Man received a visit from his Doctor, who asked him how he was. “Fairly well, Doctor,” said he, “but I find I sweat a great deal.” “Ah,” said the Doctor, “that's a good sign.” On his next visit he asked the same question, and his patient replied, “I'm much as usual, but I've taken to having shivering fits, which leave me cold all over.” “Ah,” said the Doctor, “that's a good sign too.” When he came the third time and inquired as before about his patient's health, the Sick Man said that he felt very feverish. “A very good sign,” said the Doctor; “you are doing very nicely indeed.” Afterwards a friend came to see the invalid, and on asking him how he did, received this reply: “My dear friend, I'm dying of good signs.”





THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PLANE-TREE


Two Travellers were walking along a bare and dusty road in the heat of a summer's day. Coming presently to a Plane-tree, they joyfully turned aside to shelter from the burning rays of the sun in the deep shade of its spreading branches. As they rested, looking up into the tree, one of them remarked to his companion, “What a useless tree the Plane is! It bears no fruit and is of no service to man at all.” The Plane-tree interrupted him with indignation. “You ungrateful creature!” it cried: “you come and take shelter under me from the scorching sun, and then, in the very act of enjoying the cool shade of my foliage, you abuse me and call me good for nothing!”

Many a service is met with ingratitude.





THE FLEA AND THE OX


A Flea once said to an Ox, “How comes it that a big strong fellow like you is content to serve mankind, and do all their hard work for them, while I, who am no bigger than you see, live on their bodies and drink my fill of their blood, and never do a stroke for it all?” To which the Ox replied, “Men are very kind to me, and so I am grateful to them: they feed and house me well, and every now and then they show their fondness for me by patting me on the head and neck.” “They'd pat me, too,” said the Flea, “if I let them: but I take good care they don't, or there would be nothing left of me.”





THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT


The Birds were at war with the Beasts, and many battles were fought with varying success on either side. The Bat did not throw in his lot definitely with either party, but when things went well for the Birds he was found fighting in their ranks; when, on the other hand, the Beasts got the upper hand, he was to be found among the Beasts. No one paid any attention to him while the war lasted: but when it was over, and peace was restored, neither the Birds nor the Beasts would have anything to do with so double-faced a traitor, and so he remains to this day a solitary outcast from both.





THE MAN AND HIS TWO SWEETHEARTS


A Man of middle age, whose hair was turning grey, had two Sweethearts, an old woman and a young one. The elder of the two didn't like having a lover who looked so much younger than herself; so, whenever he came to see her, she used to pull the dark hairs out of his head to make him look old. The younger, on the other hand, didn't like him to look so much older than herself, and took every opportunity of pulling out the grey hairs, to make him look young. Between them, they left not a hair in his head, and he became perfectly bald.





THE EAGLE, THE JACKDAW, AND THE SHEPHERD


One day a Jackdaw saw an Eagle swoop down on a lamb and carry it off in its talons. “My word,” said the Jackdaw, “I'll do that myself.” So it flew high up into the air, and then came shooting down with a great whirring of wings on to the back of a big ram. It had no sooner alighted than its claws got caught fast in the wool, and nothing it could do was of any use: there it stuck, flapping away, and only making things worse instead of better. By and by up came the Shepherd. “Oho,” he said, “so that's what you'd be doing, is it?” And he took the Jackdaw, and clipped its wings and carried it home to his children. It looked so odd that they didn't know what to make of it. “What sort of bird is it, father?” they asked. “It's a Jackdaw,” he replied, “and nothing but a Jackdaw: but it wants to be taken for an Eagle.”

If you attempt what is beyond your power, your trouble will be wasted and you court not only misfortune but ridicule.





THE WOLF AND THE BOY


A Wolf, who had just enjoyed a good meal and was in a playful mood, caught sight of a Boy lying flat upon the ground, and, realising that he was trying to hide, and that it was fear of himself that made him do this, he went up to him and said, “Aha, I've found you, you see; but if you can say three things to me, the truth of which cannot be disputed, I will spare your life.” The Boy plucked up courage and thought for a moment, and then he said, “First, it is a pity you saw me; secondly, I was a fool to let myself be seen; and thirdly, we all hate wolves because they are always making unprovoked attacks upon our flocks.” The Wolf replied, “Well, what you say is true enough from your point of view; so you may go.”





THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS


A Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market in hopes of finding a purchaser for him. On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, “Did you ever see such a pair of fools? To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding!” The Miller thought there was sense in what they said;so he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side. Presently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, “You'll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot! Make him walk, young lazybones! It'll do him all the good in the world.” The Miller followed their advice, and took his Son's place on the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind. They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the Miller heard them say, “What a selfish old man! He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs!” So he made his Son get up behind him. Further along the road they met some travellers, who asked the Miller whether the Ass he was riding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion. He replied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to sell. “Good heavens!” said they, “with a load like that the poor beast will be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look at him. Why, you'd do better to carry him!” “Anything to please you,” said the old man, “we can but try.” So they got off, tied the Ass's legs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached the town, carrying him between them. This was so absurd a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the Father and Son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics. They had then got to a bridge over the river, where the Ass, frightened by the noise and his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the ropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned. Whereupon the unfortunate Miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that in trying to please all he had pleased none, and had lost his Ass into the bargain.





THE STAG AND THE VINE


A Stag, pursued by the huntsmen, concealed himself under cover of a thick Vine. They lost track of him and passed by his hiding-place without being aware that he was anywhere near. Supposing all danger to be over, he presently began to browse on the leaves of the Vine. The movement drew the attention of the returning huntsmen, and one of them, supposing some animal to be hidden there, shot an arrow at a venture into the foliage. The unlucky Stag was pierced to the heart, and, as he expired, he said, “I deserve my fate for my treachery in feeding upon the leaves of my protector.”

Ingratitude sometimes brings its own punishment.





THE LAMB CHASED BY A WOLF


A Wolf was chasing a Lamb, which took refuge in a temple. The Wolf urged it to come out of the precincts, and said, “If you don't, the priest is sure to catch you and offer you up in sacrifice on the altar.” To which the Lamb replied, “Thanks, I think I'll stay where I am: I'd rather be sacrificed any day than be eaten up by a Wolf.”





THE ARCHER AND THE LION


An Archer went up into the hills to get some sport with his bow, and all the animals fled at the sight of him with the exception of the Lion, who stayed behind and challenged him to fight. But he shot an arrow at the Lion and hit him, and said, “There, you see what my messenger can do: just you wait a moment and I'll tackle you myself.” The Lion, however, when he felt the sting of the arrow, ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. A fox, who had seen it all happen, said to the Lion, “Come, don't be a coward: why don't you stay and show fight?” But the Lion replied, “You won't get me to stay, not you: why, when he sends a messenger like that before him, he must himself be a terrible fellow to deal with.”

Give a wide berth to those who can do damage at a distance.





THE WOLF AND THE GOAT


A Wolf caught sight of a Goat browsing above him on the scanty herbage that grew on the top of a steep rock; and being unable to get at her, tried to induce her to come lower down. “You are risking your life up there, madam, indeed you are,” he called out, “pray take my advice and come down here, where you will find plenty of better food.” The Goat turned a knowing eye upon him. “It's little you care whether I get good grass or bad,” said she, “what you want is to eat me.”





THE SICK STAG


A Stag fell sick and lay in a clearing in the forest, too weak to move from the spot. When the news of his illness spread, a number of the other beasts came to inquire after his health, and they one and all nibbled a little of the grass that grew round the invalid till at last there was not a blade within his reach. In a few days he began to mend, but was still too feeble to get up and go in search of fodder; and thus he perished miserably of hunger owing to the thoughtlessness of his friends.





THE ASS AND THE MULE


A certain man who had an Ass and a Mule loaded them both up one day and set out upon a journey. So long as the road was fairly level, the Ass got on very well: but by and by they came to a place among the hills where the road was very rough and steep, and the Ass was at his last gasp. So he begged the Mule to relieve him of a part of his load: but the Mule refused. At last, from sheer weariness, the Ass stumbled and fell down a steep place and was killed. The driver was in despair, but he did the best he could: he added the Ass's load to the Mule's, and he also flayed the Ass and put his skin on the top of the double load. The Mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he staggered painfully along, he said to himself, “I have only got what I deserved: if I had been willing to help the Ass at first, I should not now be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain.”





BROTHER AND SISTER


A certain man had two children, a boy and a girl: and the boy was as good-looking as the girl was plain. One day, as they were playing together in their mother's chamber, they chanced upon a mirror and saw their own features for the first time. The boy saw what a handsome fellow he was, and began to boast to his Sister about his good looks: she, on her part, was ready to cry with vexation when she was aware of her plainness, and took his remarks as an insult to herself. Running to her father, she told him of her Brother's conceit, and accused him of meddling with his mother's things. He laughed and kissed them both, and said, “My children, learn from now onwards to make a good use of the glass. You, my boy, strive to be as good as it shows you to be handsome; and you, my girl, resolve to make up for the plainness of your features by the sweetness of your disposition.”





THE HEIFER AND THE OX


A Heifer went up to an Ox, who was straining hard at the plough, and sympathised with him in a rather patronising sort of way on the necessity of his having to work so hard. Not long afterwards there was a festival in the village and every one kept holiday: but, whereas the Ox was turned loose into the pasture, the Heifer was seized and led off to sacrifice. “Ah,” said the Ox, with a grim smile, “I see now why you were allowed to have such an idle time: it was because you were always intended for the altar.”





THE KINGDOM OF THE LION


When the Lion reigned over the beasts of the earth he was never cruel or tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a King ought to be. During his reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and drew up a code of laws under which all were to live in perfect equality and harmony: the wolf and the lamb, the tiger and the stag, the leopard and the kid, the dog and the hare, all should dwell side by side in unbroken peace and friendship. The hare said, “Oh! how I have longed for this day when the weak take their place without fear by the side of the strong!”





THE ASS AND HIS DRIVER


An Ass was being driven down a mountain road, and after jogging along for a while sensibly enough he suddenly quitted the track and rushed to the edge of a precipice. He was just about to leap over the edge when his Driver caught hold of his tail and did his best to pull him back: but pull as he might he couldn't get the Ass to budge from the brink. At last he gave up, crying, “All right, then, get to the bottom your own way; but it's the way to sudden death, as you'll find out quick enough.”





THE LION AND THE HARE


A Lion found a Hare sleeping in her form, and was just going to devour her when he caught sight of a passing stag. Dropping the Hare, he at once made for the bigger game; but finding, after a long chase, that he could not overtake the stag, he abandoned the attempt and came back for the Hare. When he reached the spot, however, he found she was nowhere to be seen, and he had to go without his dinner. “It serves me right,” he said, “I should have been content with what I had got, instead of hankering after a better prize.”





THE WOLVES AND THE DOGS


Once upon a time the Wolves said to the Dogs, “Why should we continue to be enemies any longer? You are very like us in most ways: the main difference between us is one of training only. We live a life of freedom; but you are enslaved to mankind, who beat you, and put heavy collars round your necks, and compel you to keep watch over their flocks and herds for them, and, to crown all, they give you nothing but bones to eat. Don't put up with it any longer, but hand over the flocks to us, and we will all live on the fat of the land and feast together.” The Dogs allowed themselves to be persuaded by these words, and accompanied the Wolves into their den. But no sooner were they well inside than the Wolves set upon them and tore them to pieces.

Traitors richly deserve their fate.





THE BULL AND THE CALF


A full-grown Bull was struggling to force his huge bulk through the narrow entrance to a cow-house where his stall was, when a young Calf came up and said to him, “If you'll step aside a moment, I'll show you the way to get through.” The Bull turned upon him an amused look. “I knew that way,” said he, “before you were born.”





THE TREES AND THE AXE


A Woodman went into the forest and begged of the Trees the favour of a handle for his Axe. The principal Trees at once agreed to so modest a request, and unhesitatingly gave him a young ash sapling, out of which he fashioned the handle he desired. No sooner had he done so than he set to work to fell the noblest Trees in the wood. When they saw the use to which he was putting their gift, they cried, “Alas! alas! We are undone, but we are ourselves to blame. The little we gave has cost us all: had we not sacrificed the rights of the ash, we might ourselves have stood for ages.”





THE ASTRONOMER


There was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars. One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well. As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, “If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn't even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you've got.”





THE LABOURER AND THE SNAKE


A Labourer's little son was bitten by a Snake and died of the wound. The father was beside himself with grief, and in his anger against the Snake he caught up an axe and went and stood close to the Snake's hole, and watched for a chance of killing it. Presently the Snake came out, and the man aimed a blow at it, but only succeeded in cutting off the tip of its tail before it wriggled in again. He then tried to get it to come out a second time, pretending that he wished to make up the quarrel. But the Snake said, “I can never be your friend because of my lost tail, nor you mine because of your lost child.”

Injuries are never forgotten in the presence of those who caused them.





THE CAGE-BIRD AND THE BAT


A Singing-bird was confined in a cage which hung outside a window, and had a way of singing at night when all other birds were asleep. One night a Bat came and clung to the bars of the cage, and asked the Bird why she was silent by day and sang only at night. “I have a very good reason for doing so,” said the Bird, “it was once when I was singing in the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice, and set his nets for me and caught me. Since then I have never sung except by night.” But the Bat replied, “It is no use your doing that now when you are a prisoner: if only you had done so before you were caught, you might still have been free.”

Precautions are useless after the event.





THE ASS AND HIS PURCHASER


A Man who wanted to buy an Ass went to market, and, coming across a likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be allowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like. When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses. The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to see him back so soon, and said, “Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?” “I don't want to put him through any more tests,” replied the other, “I could see what sort of beast he is from the companion he chose for himself.”

A man is known by the company he keeps.





THE KID AND THE WOLF


A Kid strayed from the flock and was chased by a Wolf. When he saw he must be caught he turned round and said to the Wolf, “I know, sir, that I can't escape being eaten by you: and so, as my life is bound to be short, I pray you let it be as merry as may be. Will you not play me a tune to dance to before I die?” The Wolf saw no objection to having some music before his dinner: so he took out his pipe and began to play, while the Kid danced before him. Before many minutes were passed the gods who guarded the flock heard the sound and came up to see what was going on. They no sooner clapped eyes on the Wolf than they gave chase and drove him away. As he ran off, he turned and said to the Kid, “It's what I thoroughly deserve: my trade is the butcher's, and I had no business to turn piper to please you.”





THE DEBTOR AND HIS SOW


A Man of Athens fell into debt and was pressed for the money by his creditor; but he had no means of paying at the time, so he begged for delay. But the creditor refused and said he must pay at once. Then the Debtor fetched a Sow—the only one he had—and took her to market to offer her for sale. It happened that his creditor was there too. Presently a buyer came along and asked if the Sow produced good litters. “Yes,” said the Debtor, “very fine ones; and the remarkable thing is that she produces females at the Mysteries and males at the Panathenea.” (Festivals these were: and the Athenians always sacrifice a sow at one, and a boar at the other; while at the Dionysia they sacrifice a kid.) At that the creditor, who was standing by, put in, “Don't be surprised, sir; why, still better, at the Dionysia this Sow has kids!”





The Kid and the Wolf





THE BALD HUNTSMAN


A Man who had lost all his hair took to wearing a wig, and one day he went out hunting. It was blowing rather hard at the time, and he hadn't gone far before a gust of wind caught his hat and carried it off, and his wig too, much to the amusement of the hunt. But he quite entered into the joke, and said, “Ah, well! The hair that wig is made of didn't stick to the head on which it grew; so it's no wonder it won't stick to mine.”





THE HERDSMAN AND THE LOST BULL


A Herdsman was tending his cattle when he missed a young Bull, one of the finest of the herd. He went at once to look for him, but, meeting with no success in his search, he made a vow that, if he should discover the thief, he would sacrifice a calf to Jupiter. Continuing his search, he entered a thicket, where he presently espied a lion devouring the lost Bull. Terrified with fear, he raised his hands to heaven and cried, “Great Jupiter, I vowed I would sacrifice a calf to thee if I should discover the thief: but now a full-grown Bull I promise thee if only I myself escape unhurt from his clutches.”





THE MULE


One morning a Mule, who had too much to eat and too little to do, began to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked about saying, “My father was undoubtedly a high-spirited horse and I take after him entirely.” But very soon afterwards he was put into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy load behind him. At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, “I must have been mistaken about my father; he can only have been an ass after all.”





THE HOUND AND THE FOX


A Hound, roaming in the forest, spied a lion, and being well used to lesser game, gave chase, thinking he would make a fine quarry. Presently the lion perceived that he was being pursued; so, stopping short, he rounded on his pursuer and gave a loud roar. The Hound immediately turned tail and fled. A Fox, seeing him running away, jeered at him and said, “Ho! ho! There goes the coward who chased a lion and ran away the moment he roared!”





THE FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTERS


A Man had two Daughters, one of whom he gave in marriage to a gardener, and the other to a potter. After a time he thought he would go and see how they were getting on; and first he went to the gardener's wife. He asked her how she was, and how things were going with herself and her husband. She replied that on the whole they were doing very well: “But,” she continued, “I do wish we could have some good heavy rain: the garden wants it badly.” Then he went on to the potter's wife and made the same inquiries of her. She replied that she and her husband had nothing to complain of: “But,” she went on, “I do wish we could have some nice dry weather, to dry the pottery.” Her Father looked at her with a humorous expression on his face. “You want dry weather,” he said, “and your sister wants rain. I was going to ask in my prayers that your wishes should be granted; but now it strikes me I had better not refer to the subject.”





THE THIEF AND THE INNKEEPER


A Thief hired a room at an inn, and stayed there some days on the look-out for something to steal. No opportunity, however, presented itself, till one day, when there was a festival to be celebrated, the Innkeeper appeared in a fine new coat and sat down before the door of the inn for an airing. The Thief no sooner set eyes upon the coat than he longed to get possession of it. There was no business doing, so he went and took a seat by the side of the Innkeeper, and began talking to him. They conversed together for some time, and then the Thief suddenly yawned and howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper asked him in some concern what ailed him. The Thief replied, “I will tell you about myself, sir, but first I must beg you to take charge of my clothes for me, for I intend to leave them with you. Why I have these fits of yawning I cannot tell: maybe they are sent as a punishment for my misdeeds; but, whatever the reason, the facts are that when I have yawned three times I become a ravening wolf and fly at men's throats.” As he finished speaking he yawned a second time and howled again as before. The Innkeeper, believing every word he said, and terrified at the prospect of being confronted with a wolf, got up hastily and started to run indoors; but the Thief caught him by the coat and tried to stop him, crying, “Stay, sir, stay, and take charge of my clothes, or else I shall never see them again.” As he spoke he opened his mouth and began to yawn for the third time. The Innkeeper, mad with the fear of being eaten by a wolf, slipped out of his coat, which remained in the other's hands, and bolted into the inn and locked the door behind him; and the Thief then quietly stole off with his spoil.





THE PACK-ASS AND THE WILD ASS


A Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself. Going up to him, he said, “What a lucky beast you are! Your sleek coat shows how well you live: how I envy you!” Not long after the Wild Ass saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick. “Ah, my friend,” said the Wild Ass, “I don't envy you any more: for I see you pay dear for your comforts.”

Advantages that are dearly bought are doubtful blessings.





THE ASS AND HIS MASTERS


A Gardener had an Ass which had a very hard time of it, what with scanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating. The Ass therefore begged Jupiter to take him away from the Gardener and hand him over to another master. So Jupiter sent Mercury to the Gardener to bid him sell the Ass to a Potter, which he did. But the Ass was as discontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before: so he begged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly arranged that he should be sold to a Tanner. But when the Ass saw what his new master's trade was, he cried in despair, “Why wasn't I content to serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly as I was treated? for they would have buried me decently, but now I shall come in the end to the tanning-vat.”

Servants don't know a good master till they have served a worse.





THE PACK-ASS, THE WILD ASS, AND THE LION


A Wild Ass saw a Pack-Ass jogging along under a heavy load, and taunted him with the condition of slavery in which he lived, in these words: “What a vile lot is yours compared with mine! I am free as the air, and never do a stroke of work; and, as for fodder, I have only to go to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs. But you! You depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry heavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully.” At that moment a Lion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the Pack-Ass owing to the presence of the driver; but he fell upon the Wild Ass, who had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of him.

It is no use being your own master unless you can stand up for yourself.





THE ANT


Ants were once men and made their living by tilling the soil. But, not content with the results of their own work, they were always casting longing eyes upon the crops and fruits of their neighbours, which they stole, whenever they got the chance, and added to their own store. At last their covetousness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them into Ants. But, though their forms were changed, their nature remained the same: and so, to this day, they go about among the cornfields and gather the fruits of others' labour, and store them up for their own use.

You may punish a thief, but his bent remains.





THE FROGS AND THE WELL


Two Frogs lived together in a marsh. But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them. By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, “This looks a nice cool place: let us jump in and settle here.” But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, “Not so fast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?”

Think twice before you act.





The Frogs and the Well





THE CRAB AND THE FOX


A Crab once left the sea-shore and went and settled in a meadow some way inland, which looked very nice and green and seemed likely to be a good place to feed in. But a hungry Fox came along and spied the Crab and caught him. Just as he was going to be eaten up, the Crab said, “This is just what I deserve; for I had no business to leave my natural home by the sea and settle here as though I belonged to the land.”

Be content with your lot.





THE FOX AND THE GRASSHOPPER


A Grasshopper sat chirping in the branches of a tree. A Fox heard her, and, thinking what a dainty morsel she would make, he tried to get her down by a trick. Standing below in full view of her, he praised her song in the most flattering terms, and begged her to descend, saying he would like to make the acquaintance of the owner of so beautiful a voice. But she was not to be taken in, and replied, “You are very much mistaken, my dear sir, if you imagine I am going to come down: I keep well out of the way of you and your kind ever since the day when I saw numbers of grasshoppers' wings strewn about the entrance to a fox's earth.”





THE FARMER, HIS BOY, AND THE ROOKS


A Farmer had just sown a field of wheat, and was keeping a careful watch over it, for numbers of Rooks and starlings kept continually settling on it and eating up the grain. Along with him went his Boy, carrying a sling: and whenever the Farmer asked for the sling the starlings understood what he said and warned the Rooks and they were off in a moment. So the Farmer hit on a trick. “My lad,” said he, “we must get the better of these birds somehow. After this, when I want the sling, I won't say ‘sling,’ but just ‘humph!’ and you must then hand me the sling quickly.” Presently back came the whole flock. “Humph!” said the Farmer; but the starlings took no notice, and he had time to sling several stones among them, hitting one on the head, another in the legs, and another in the wing, before they got out of range. As they made all haste away they met some cranes, who asked them what the matter was. “Matter?” said one of the Rooks, “it's those rascals, men, that are the matter. Don't you go near them. They have a way of saying one thing and meaning another which has just been the death of several of our poor friends.”





THE ASS AND THE DOG


An Ass and a Dog were on their travels together, and, as they went along, they found a sealed packet lying on the ground. The Ass picked it up, broke the seal, and found it contained some writing, which he proceeded to read out aloud to the Dog. As he read on it turned out to be all about grass and barley and hay—in short, all the kinds of fodder that Asses are fond of. The Dog was a good deal bored with listening to all this, till at last his impatience got the better of him, and he cried, “Just skip a few pages, friend, and see if there isn't something about meat and bones.” The Ass glanced all through the packet, but found nothing of the sort, and said so. Then the Dog said in disgust, “Oh, throw it away, do: what's the good of a thing like that?”





THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE


A certain man put an Image on the back of his Ass to take it to one of the temples of the town. As they went along the road all the people they met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the Image; but the Ass thought they were doing it out of respect for himself, and began to give himself airs accordingly. At last he became so conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of protest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and flatly declined to proceed any further. His driver, finding him so obstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while, “Oh, you dunder-headed idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass?”

Rude shocks await those who take to themselves the credit that is due to others.





THE ATHENIAN AND THE THEBAN


An Athenian and a Theban were on the road together, and passed the time in conversation, as is the way of travellers. After discussing a variety of subjects they began to talk about heroes, a topic that tends to be more fertile than edifying. Each of them was lavish in his praises of the heroes of his own city, until eventually the Theban asserted that Hercules was the greatest hero who had ever lived on earth, and now occupied a foremost place among the gods; while the Athenian insisted that Theseus was far superior, for his fortune had been in every way supremely blessed, whereas Hercules had at one time been forced to act as a servant. And he gained his point, for he was a very glib fellow, like all Athenians; so that the Theban, who was no match for him in talking, cried at last in some disgust, “All right, have your way; I only hope that, when our heroes are angry with us, Athens may suffer from the anger of Hercules, and Thebes only from that of Theseus.”





THE GOATHERD AND THE GOAT


A Goatherd was one day gathering his flock to return to the fold, when one of his goats strayed and refused to join the rest. He tried for a long time to get her to return by calling and whistling to her, but the Goat took no notice of him at all; so at last he threw a stone at her and broke one of her horns. In dismay, he begged her not to tell his master: but she replied, “You silly fellow, my horn would cry aloud even if I held my tongue.”

It's no use trying to hide what can't be hidden.





THE SHEEP AND THE DOG


Once upon a time the Sheep complained to the shepherd about the difference in his treatment of themselves and his Dog. “Your conduct,” said they, “is very strange and, we think, very unfair. We provide you with wool and lambs and milk and you give us nothing but grass, and even that we have to find for ourselves: but you get nothing at all from the Dog, and yet you feed him with tit-bits from your own table.” Their remarks were overheard by the Dog, who spoke up at once and said, “Yes, and quite right, too: where would you be if it wasn't for me? Thieves would steal you! Wolves would eat you! Indeed, if I didn't keep constant watch over you, you would be too terrified even to graze!” The Sheep were obliged to acknowledge that he spoke the truth, and never again made a grievance of the regard in which he was held by his master.





The Goatherd and the Goat





THE SHEPHERD AND THE WOLF


A Shepherd found a Wolf's Cub straying in the pastures, and took him home and reared him along with his dogs. When the Cub grew to his full size, if ever a wolf stole a sheep from the flock, he used to join the dogs in hunting him down. It sometimes happened that the dogs failed to come up with the thief, and, abandoning the pursuit, returned home. The Wolf would on such occasions continue the chase by himself, and when he overtook the culprit, would stop and share the feast with him, and then return to the Shepherd. But if some time passed without a sheep being carried off by the wolves, he would steal one himself and share his plunder with the dogs. The Shepherd's suspicions were aroused, and one day he caught him in the act; and, fastening a rope round his neck, hung him on the nearest tree.

What's bred in the bone is sure to come out in the flesh.





THE LION, JUPITER, AND THE ELEPHANT


The Lion, for all his size and strength, and his sharp teeth and claws, is a coward in one thing: he can't bear the sound of a cock crowing, and runs away whenever he hears it. He complained bitterly to Jupiter for making him like that; but Jupiter said it wasn't his fault: he had done the best he could for him, and, considering this was his only failing, he ought to be well content. The Lion, however, wouldn't be comforted, and was so ashamed of his timidity that he wished he might die. In this state of mind, he met the Elephant and had a talk with him. He noticed that the great beast cocked up his ears all the time, as if he were listening for something, and he asked him why he did so. Just then a gnat came humming by, and the Elephant said, “Do you see that wretched little buzzing insect? I'm terribly afraid of its getting into my ear: if it once gets in, I'm dead and done for.” The Lion's spirits rose at once when he heard this: “For,” he said to himself, “if the Elephant, huge as he is, is afraid of a gnat, I needn't be so much ashamed of being afraid of a cock, who is ten thousand times bigger than a gnat.”





THE PIG AND THE SHEEP


A Pig found his way into a meadow where a flock of Sheep were grazing. The shepherd caught him, and was proceeding to carry him off to the butcher's when he set up a loud squealing and struggled to get free. The Sheep rebuked him for making such a to-do, and said to him, “The shepherd catches us regularly and drags us off just like that, and we don't make any fuss.” “No, I dare say not,” replied the Pig, “but my case and yours are altogether different: he only wants you for wool, but he wants me for bacon.”





The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant





THE GARDENER AND HIS DOG


A Gardener's Dog fell into a deep well, from which his master used to draw water for the plants in his garden with a rope and a bucket. Failing to get the Dog out by means of these, the Gardener went down into the well himself in order to fetch him up. But the Dog thought he had come to make sure of drowning him; so he bit his master as soon as he came within reach, and hurt him a good deal, with the result that he left the Dog to his fate and climbed out of the well, remarking, “It serves me quite right for trying to save so determined a suicide.”





THE RIVERS AND THE SEA


Once upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action of the Sea in making their waters salt. “When we come to you,” said they to the Sea, “we are sweet and drinkable: but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own.” The Sea replied shortly, “Keep away from me and you'll remain sweet.”





THE LION IN LOVE


A Lion fell deeply in love with the daughter of a cottager and wanted to marry her; but her father was unwilling to give her to so fearsome a husband, and yet didn't want to offend the Lion; so he hit upon the following expedient. He went to the Lion and said, “I think you will make a very good husband for my daughter: but I cannot consent to your union unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my daughter is terribly afraid of them.” The Lion was so much in love that he readily agreed that this should be done. When once, however, he was thus disarmed, the Cottager was afraid of him no longer, but drove him away with his club.





THE BEE-KEEPER


A Thief found his way into an apiary when the Bee-keeper was away, and stole all the honey. When the Keeper returned and found the hives empty, he was very much upset and stood staring at them for some time. Before long the bees came back from gathering honey, and, finding their hives overturned and the Keeper standing by, they made for him with their stings. At this he fell into a passion and cried, “You ungrateful scoundrels, you let the thief who stole my honey get off scot-free, and then you go and sting me who have always taken such care of you!”

When you hit back make sure you have got the right man.





THE WOLF AND THE HORSE


A Wolf on his rambles came to a field of oats, but, not being able to eat them, he was passing on his way when a Horse came along. “Look,” said the Wolf, “here's a fine field of oats. For your sake I have left it untouched, and I shall greatly enjoy the sound of your teeth munching the ripe grain.” But the Horse replied, “If wolves could eat oats, my fine friend, you would hardly have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly.”

There is no virtue in giving to others what is useless to oneself.





THE BAT, THE BRAMBLE, AND THE SEAGULL


A Bat, a Bramble, and a Seagull went into partnership and determined to go on a trading voyage together. The Bat borrowed a sum of money for his venture; the Bramble laid in a stock of clothes of various kinds; and the Seagull took a quantity of lead: and so they set out. By and by a great storm came on, and their boat with all the cargo went to the bottom, but the three travellers managed to reach land. Ever since then the Seagull flies to and fro over the sea, and every now and then dives below the surface, looking for the lead he's lost; while the Bat is so afraid of meeting his creditors that he hides away by day and only comes out at night to feed; and the Bramble catches hold of the clothes of every one who passes by, hoping some day to recognise and recover the lost garments.

All men are more concerned to recover what they lose than to acquire what they lack.





The Wolf and the Horse





THE DOG AND THE WOLF


A Dog was lying in the sun before a farmyard gate when a Wolf pounced upon him and was just going to eat him up; but he begged for his life and said, “You see how thin I am and what a wretched meal I should make you now: but if you will only wait a few days my master is going to give a feast. All the rich scraps and pickings will fall to me and I shall get nice and fat: then will be the time for you to eat me.” The Wolf thought this was a very good plan and went away. Some time afterwards he came to the farmyard again, and found the Dog lying out of reach on the stable roof. “Come down,” he called, “and be eaten: you remember our agreement?” But the Dog said coolly, “My friend, if ever you catch me lying down by the gate there again, don't you wait for any feast.”

Once bitten, twice shy.





THE WASP AND THE SNAKE


A Wasp settled on the head of a Snake, and not only stung him several times, but clung obstinately to the head of his victim. Maddened with pain the Snake tried every means he could think of to get rid of the creature, but without success. At last he became desperate, and crying, “Kill you I will, even at the cost of my own life,” he laid his head with the Wasp on it under the wheel of a passing waggon, and they both perished together.





THE EAGLE AND THE BEETLE


An Eagle was chasing a hare, which was running for dear life and was at her wits' end to know where to turn for help. Presently she espied a Beetle, and begged it to aid her. So when the Eagle came up the Beetle warned her not to touch the hare, which was under its protection. But the Eagle never noticed the Beetle because it was so small, seized the hare and ate her up. The Beetle never forgot this, and used to keep an eye on the Eagle's nest, and whenever the Eagle laid an egg it climbed up and rolled it out of the nest and broke it. At last the Eagle got so worried over the loss of her eggs that she went up to Jupiter, who is the special protector of Eagles, and begged him to give her a safe place to nest in: so he let her lay her eggs in his lap. But the Beetle noticed this and made a ball of dirt the size of an Eagle's egg, and flew up and deposited it in Jupiter's lap. When Jupiter saw the dirt, he stood up to shake it out of his robe, and, forgetting about the eggs, he shook them out too, and they were broken just as before. Ever since then, they say, Eagles never lay their eggs at the season when Beetles are about.

The weak will sometimes find ways to avenge an insult, even upon the strong.





THE FOWLER AND THE LARK


A Fowler was setting his nets for little birds when a Lark came up to him and asked him what he was doing. “I am engaged in founding a city,” said he, and with that he withdrew to a short distance and concealed himself. The Lark examined the nets with great curiosity, and presently, catching sight of the bait, hopped on to them in order to secure it, and became entangled in the meshes. The Fowler then ran up quickly and captured her. “What a fool I was!” said she, “but at any rate, if that's the kind of city you are founding, it'll be a long time before you find fools enough to fill it.”





THE FISHERMAN PIPING


A Fisherman who could play the flute went down one day to the sea-shore with his nets and his flute; and, taking his stand on a projecting rock, began to play a tune, thinking that the music would bring the fish jumping out of the sea. He went on playing for some time, but not a fish appeared: so at last he threw down his flute and cast his net into the sea, and made a great haul of fish. When they were landed and he saw them leaping about on the shore, he cried, “You rascals! you wouldn't dance when I piped: but now I've stopped, you can do nothing else!”





THE WEASEL AND THE MAN


A Man once caught a Weasel, which was always sneaking about the house, and was just going to drown it in a tub of water, when it begged hard for its life, and said to him, “Surely you haven't the heart to put me to death? Think how useful I have been in clearing your house of the mice and lizards which used to infest it, and show your gratitude by sparing my life.” “You have not been altogether useless, I grant you,” said the Man, “but who killed the fowls? Who stole the meat? No, no! You do much more harm than good, and die you shall.”





THE PLOUGHMAN, THE ASS, AND THE OX


A Ploughman yoked his Ox and his Ass together, and set to work to plough his field. It was a poor makeshift of a team, but it was the best he could do, as he had but a single Ox. At the end of the day, when the beasts were loosed from the yoke, the Ass said to the Ox, “Well, we've had a hard day: which of us is to carry the master home?” The Ox looked surprised at the question. “Why,” said he, “you, to be sure, as usual.”





DEMADES AND HIS FABLE


Demades the orator was once speaking in the Assembly at Athens; but the people were very inattentive to what he was saying, so he stopped and said, “Gentlemen, I should like to tell you one of Aesop's fables.” This made every one listen intently. Then Demades began: “Demeter, a Swallow, and an Eel were once travelling together, and came to a river without a bridge: the Swallow flew over it, and the Eel swam across.” And then he stopped. “What happened to Demeter?” cried several people in the audience. “Demeter,” he replied, “is very angry with you for listening to fables when you ought to be minding public business.”





THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN


When people go on a voyage they often take with them lap-dogs or monkeys as pets to wile away the time. Thus it fell out that a man returning to Athens from the East had a pet Monkey on board with him. As they neared the coast of Attica a great storm burst upon them, and the ship capsized. All on board were thrown into the water, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the Monkey among the rest. A Dolphin saw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back and began swimming towards the shore. When they got near the Piræus, which is the port of Athens, the Dolphin asked the Monkey if he was an Athenian. The Monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of a very distinguished family. “Then, of course, you know the Piræus.” continued the Dolphin. The Monkey thought he was referring to some high official or other, and replied, “Oh, yes, he's a very old friend of mine.” At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the Dolphin was so disgusted that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate Monkey was quickly drowned.





THE CROW AND THE SNAKE


A hungry Crow spied a Snake lying asleep in a sunny spot, and, picking it up in his claws, he was carrying it off to a place where he could make a meal of it without being disturbed, when the Snake reared its head and bit him. It was a poisonous Snake, and the bite was fatal, and the dying Crow said, “What a cruel fate is mine! I thought I had made a lucky find, and it has cost me my life!”





THE DOGS AND THE FOX


Some Dogs once found a lion's skin, and were worrying it with their teeth. Just then a Fox came by, and said, “You think yourselves very brave, no doubt; but if that were a live lion you'd find his claws a good deal sharper than your teeth.”





THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE HAWK


A Nightingale was sitting on a bough of an oak and singing, as her custom was. A hungry Hawk presently spied her, and darting to the spot seized her in his talons. He was just about to tear her in pieces when she begged him to spare her life: “I'm not big enough,” she pleaded, “to make you a good meal: you ought to seek your prey among the bigger birds.” The Hawk eyed her with some contempt. “You must think me very simple,” said he, “if you suppose I am going to give up a certain prize on the chance of a better of which I see at present no signs.”





THE ROSE AND THE AMARANTH


A Rose and an Amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden, and the Amaranth said to her neighbour, “How I envy you your beauty and your sweet scent! No wonder you are such a universal favourite.” But the Rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice, “Ah, my dear friend, I bloom but for a time: my petals soon wither and fall, and then I die. But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut; for they are everlasting.”





THE MAN, THE HORSE, THE OX, AND THE DOG


One winter's day, during a severe storm, a Horse, an Ox, and a Dog came and begged for shelter in the house of a Man. He readily admitted them, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for their comfort: and he put oats before the Horse, and hay before the Ox, while he fed the Dog with the remains of his own dinner. When the storm abated, and they were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in the following way. They divided the life of Man among them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which were peculiarly his own. The Horse took youth, and hence young men are high-mettled and impatient of restraint; the Ox took middle age, and accordingly men in middle life are steady and hard-working; while the Dog took old age, which is the reason why old men are so often peevish and ill-tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their comfort, while they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.





THE WOLVES, THE SHEEP, AND THE RAM


The Wolves sent a deputation to the Sheep with proposals for a lasting peace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to instant death. The foolish Sheep agreed to the terms; but an old Ram, whose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, “How can we expect to live at peace with you? Why, even with the dogs at hand to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!”





THE SWAN


The Swan is said to sing but once in its life—when it knows that it is about to die. A certain man, who had heard of the song of the Swan, one day saw one of these birds for sale in the market, and bought it and took it home with him. A few days later he had some friends to dinner, and produced the Swan, and bade it sing for their entertainment: but the Swan remained silent. In course of time, when it was growing old, it became aware of its approaching end and broke into a sweet, sad song. When its owner heard it, he said angrily, “If the creature only sings when it is about to die, what a fool I was that day I wanted to hear its song! I ought to have wrung its neck instead of merely inviting it to sing.”





THE SNAKE AND JUPITER


A Snake suffered a good deal from being constantly trodden upon by man and beast, owing partly to the length of his body and partly to his being unable to raise himself above the surface of the ground: so he went and complained to Jupiter about the risks to which he was exposed. But Jupiter had little sympathy for him. “I dare say,” said he, “that if you had bitten the first that trod on you, the others would have taken more trouble to look where they put their feet.”





THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW


A Wolf, who was roaming about on the plain when the sun was getting low in the sky, was much impressed by the size of his shadow, and said to himself, “I had no idea I was so big. Fancy my being afraid of a lion! Why, I, not he, ought to be King of the beasts”; and, heedless of danger, he strutted about as if there could be no doubt at all about it. Just then a lion sprang upon him and began to devour him. “Alas,” he cried, “had I not lost sight of the facts, I shouldn't have been ruined by my fancies.”





THE PLOUGHMAN AND THE WOLF


A Ploughman loosed his oxen from the plough, and led them away to the water to drink. While he was absent a half-starved Wolf appeared on the scene, and went up to the plough and began chewing the leather straps attached to the yoke. As he gnawed away desperately in the hope of satisfying his craving for food, he somehow got entangled in the harness, and, taking fright, struggled to get free, tugging at the traces as if he would drag the plough along with him. Just then the Ploughman came back, and seeing what was happening, he cried, “Ah, you old rascal, I wish you would give up thieving for good and take to honest work instead.”





MERCURY AND THE MAN BITTEN BY AN ANT


A Man once saw a ship go down with all its crew, and commented severely on the injustice of the gods. “They care nothing for a man's character,” said he, “but let the good and the bad go to their deaths together.” There was an ant-heap close by where he was standing, and, just as he spoke, he was bitten in the foot by an Ant. Turning in a temper to the ant-heap he stamped upon it and crushed hundreds of unoffending ants. Suddenly Mercury appeared, and belaboured him with his staff, saying as he did so, “You villain, where's your nice sense of justice now?”





THE WILY LION


A Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns. Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice. Going up to the Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, “I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure. What a fine head! What powerful shoulders and thighs! But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns? You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly. Believe me, you would do much better without them.” The Bull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his horns cut off; and, having now lost his only means of defence, fell an easy prey to the Lion.





THE PARROT AND THE CAT


A Man once bought a Parrot and gave it the run of his house. It revelled in its liberty, and presently flew up on to the mantelpiece and screamed away to its heart's content. The noise disturbed the Cat, who was asleep on the hearthrug. Looking up at the intruder, she said, “Who may you be, and where have you come from?” The Parrot replied, “Your master has just bought me and brought me home with him.” “You impudent bird,” said the Cat, “how dare you, a newcomer, make a noise like that? Why, I was born here, and have lived here all my life, and yet, if I venture to mew, they throw things at me and chase me all over the place.” “Look here, mistress,” said the Parrot, “you just hold your tongue. My voice they delight in; but yours—yours is a perfect nuisance.”





THE STAG AND THE LION


A Stag was chased by the hounds, and took refuge in a cave, where he hoped to be safe from his pursuers. Unfortunately the cave contained a Lion, to whom he fell an easy prey. “Unhappy that I am,” he cried, “I am saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of a Lion.”

Out of the frying-pan into the fire.





THE IMPOSTOR


A certain man fell ill, and, being in a very bad way, he made a vow that he would sacrifice a hundred oxen to the gods if they would grant him a return to health. Wishing to see how he would keep his vow, they caused him to recover in a short time. Now, he hadn't an ox in the world, so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered them up on an altar, at the same time saying, “Ye gods, I call you to witness that I have discharged my vow.” The gods determined to be even with him, so they sent him a dream, in which he was bidden to go to the sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there. Hastening in great excitement to the shore, he fell in with a band of robbers, who seized him and carried him off to sell as a slave: and when they sold him a hundred crowns was the sum he fetched.

Do not promise more than you can perform.





THE DOGS AND THE HIDES


Once upon a time a number of Dogs, who were famished with hunger, saw some Hides steeping in a river, but couldn't get at them because the water was too deep. So they put their heads together, and decided to drink away at the river till it was shallow enough for them to reach the Hides. But long before that happened they burst themselves with drinking.





THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE ASS


A Lion, a Fox, and an Ass went out hunting together. They had soon taken a large booty, which the Lion requested the Ass to divide between them. The Ass divided it all into three equal parts, and modestly begged the others to take their choice; at which the Lion, bursting with fury, sprang upon the Ass and tore him to pieces. Then, glaring at the Fox, he bade him make a fresh division. The Fox gathered almost the whole in one great heap for the Lion's share, leaving only the smallest possible morsel for himself. “My dear friend,” said the Lion, “how did you get the knack of it so well?” The Fox replied, “Me? Oh, I took a lesson from the Ass.”

Happy is he who learns from the misfortunes of others.





THE FOWLER, THE PARTRIDGE, AND THE COCK


One day, as a Fowler was sitting down to a scanty supper of herbs and bread, a friend dropped in unexpectedly. The larder was empty; so he went out and caught a tame Partridge, which he kept as a decoy, and was about to wring her neck when she cried, “Surely you won't kill me? Why, what will you do without me next time you go fowling? How will you get the birds to come to your nets?” He let her go at this, and went to his hen-house, where he had a plump young Cock. When the Cock saw what he was after, he too pleaded for his life, and said, “If you kill me, how will you know the time of night? And who will wake you up in the morning when it is time to get to work?” The Fowler, however, replied, “You are useful for telling the time, I know; but, for all that, I can't send my friend supperless to bed.” And therewith he caught him and wrung his neck.





THE GNAT AND THE LION


A Gnat once went up to a Lion and said, “I am not in the least afraid of you: I don't even allow that you are a match for me in strength. What does your strength amount to after all? That you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth—just like a woman in a temper—and nothing more. But I'm stronger than you: if you don't believe it, let us fight and see.” So saying, the Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the Lion on the nose. When the Lion felt the sting, in his haste to crush him he scratched his nose badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its victory. Presently, however, it got entangled in a spider's web, and was caught and eaten by the spider, thus falling a prey to an insignificant insect after having triumphed over the King of the Beasts.





THE FARMER AND HIS DOGS


A Farmer was snowed up in his farmstead by a severe storm, and was unable to go out and procure provisions for himself and his family. So he first killed his sheep and used them for food; then, as the storm still continued, he killed his goats; and, last of all, as the weather showed no signs of improving, he was compelled to kill his oxen and eat them. When his Dogs saw the various animals being killed and eaten in turn, they said to one another, “We had better get out of this or we shall be the next to go!”





THE EAGLE AND THE FOX


An Eagle and a Fox became great friends and determined to live near one another: they thought that the more they saw of each other the better friends they would be. So the Eagle built a nest at the top of a high tree, while the Fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and produced a litter of cubs. One day the Fox went out foraging for food, and the Eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the thicket, caught up the Fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree for a meal for herself and her family. When the Fox came back, and found out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of her cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the Eagle and pay her out for her treachery. So she sat down not far off and cursed her. But it wasn't long before she had her revenge. Some villagers happened to be sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the Eagle flew down and carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest. There was a strong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that her fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground. Then the Fox ran to the spot and devoured them in full sight of the Eagle.

False faith may escape human punishment, but cannot escape the divine.





THE BUTCHER AND HIS CUSTOMERS


Two Men were buying meat at a Butcher's stall in the market-place, and, while the Butcher's back was turned for a moment, one of them snatched up a joint and hastily thrust it under the other's cloak, where it could not be seen. When the Butcher turned round, he missed the meat at once, and charged them with having stolen it: but the one who had taken it said he hadn't got it, and the one who had got it said he hadn't taken it. The Butcher felt sure they were deceiving him, but he only said, “You may cheat me with your lying, but you can't cheat the gods, and they won't let you off so lightly.”

Prevarication often amounts to perjury.





HERCULES AND MINERVA


Hercules was once travelling along a narrow road when he saw lying on the ground in front of him what appeared to be an apple, and as he passed he stamped upon it with his heel. To his astonishment, instead of being crushed it doubled in size; and, on his attacking it again and smiting it with his club, it swelled up to an enormous size and blocked up the whole road. Upon this he dropped his club, and stood looking at it in amazement. Just then Minerva appeared, and said to him, “Leave it alone, my friend; that which you see before you is the apple of discord: if you do not meddle with it, it remains small as it was at first, but if you resort to violence it swells into the thing you see.”





THE FOX WHO SERVED A LION


A Lion had a Fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the Fox found the prey and the Lion fell upon it and killed it, and then they divided it between them in certain proportions. But the Lion always got a very large share, and the Fox a very small one, which didn't please the latter at all; so he determined to set up on his own account. He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but the shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him. The hunter was now the hunted, and was very soon caught and despatched by the dogs.

Better servitude with safety than freedom with danger.





THE QUACK DOCTOR


A certain man fell sick and took to his bed. He consulted a number of doctors from time to time, and they all, with one exception, told him that his life was in no immediate danger, but that his illness would probably last a considerable time. The one who took a different view of his case, who was also the last to be consulted, bade him prepare for the worst: “You have not twenty-four hours to live,” said he, “and I fear I can do nothing.” As it turned out, however, he was quite wrong; for at the end of a few days the sick man quitted his bed and took a walk abroad, looking, it is true, as pale as a ghost. In the course of his walk he met the Doctor who had prophesied his death. “Dear me,” said the latter, “how do you do? You are fresh from the other world, no doubt. Pray, how are our departed friends getting on there?” “Most comfortably,” replied the other, “for they have drunk the water of oblivion, and have forgotten all the troubles of life. By the way, just before I left, the authorities were making arrangements to prosecute all the doctors, because they won't let sick men die in the course of nature, but use their arts to keep them alive. They were going to charge you along with the rest, till I assured them that you were no doctor, but a mere impostor.”





THE LION, THE WOLF, AND THE FOX


A Lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of the forest came to inquire after his health with the exception of the Fox. The Wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the Fox, so he called the attention of the Lion to his absence, and said, “You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the Fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill.” Just then the Fox came in and heard the last words of the Wolf. The Lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, “Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness.” “And may I ask if you have found one?” said the Lion. “I have, sire,” said the Fox, “and it is this: you must flay a Wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm.” The Lion accordingly turned to the Wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the Fox's prescription; but the Fox laughed and said to himself, “That's what comes of stirring up ill-will.”





HERCULES AND PLUTUS


When Hercules was received among the gods and was entertained at a banquet by Jupiter, he responded courteously to the greetings of all with the exception of Plutus, the god of wealth. When Plutus approached him, he cast his eyes upon the ground, and turned away and pretended not to see him. Jupiter was surprised at this conduct on his part, and asked why, after having been so cordial with all the other gods, he had behaved like that to Plutus. “Sire,” said Hercules, “I do not like Plutus, and I will tell you why. When we were on earth together I always noticed that he was to be found in the company of scoundrels.”





THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD


A Fox and a Leopard were disputing about their looks, and each claimed to be the more handsome of the two. The Leopard said, “Look at my smart coat; you have nothing to match that.” But the Fox replied, “Your coat may be smart, but my wits are smarter still.”





THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG


A Fox, in swimming across a rapid river, was swept away by the current and carried a long way downstream in spite of his struggles, until at last, bruised and exhausted, he managed to scramble on to dry ground from a backwater. As he lay there unable to move, a swarm of horseflies settled on him and sucked his blood undisturbed, for he was too weak even to shake them off. A Hedgehog saw him, and asked if he should brush away the flies that were tormenting him; but the Fox replied, “Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have sucked their fill and are taking very little from me now; but, if you drive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all the blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins.”





THE CROW AND THE RAVEN


A Crow became very jealous of a Raven, because the latter was regarded by men as a bird of omen which foretold the future, and was accordingly held in great respect by them. She was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some travellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen; till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, “It's all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it's only a crow and that means nothing.”

Those who pretend to be something they are not only make themselves ridiculous.





THE WITCH


A Witch professed to be able to avert the anger of the gods by means of charms, of which she alone possessed the secret; and she drove a brisk trade, and made a fat livelihood out of it. But certain persons accused her of black magic and carried her before the judges, and demanded that she should be put to death for dealings with the Devil. She was found guilty and condemned to death: and one of the judges said to her as she was leaving the dock, “You say you can avert the anger of the gods. How comes it, then, that you have failed to disarm the enmity of men?”





THE OLD MAN AND DEATH


An Old Man cut himself a bundle of faggots in a wood and started to carry them home. He had a long way to go, and was tired out before he had got much more than half-way. Casting his burden on the ground, he called upon Death to come and release him from his life of toil. The words were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him. He was almost frightened out of his wits, but he had enough presence of mind to stammer out, “Good sir, if you'd be so kind, pray help me up with my burden again.”





THE MISER


A Miser sold everything he had, and melted down his hoard of gold into a single lump, which he buried secretly in a field. Every day he went to look at it, and would sometimes spend long hours gloating over his treasure. One of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot, and one day watched him and discovered his secret. Waiting his opportunity, he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it. Next day the Miser visited the place as usual, and, finding his treasure gone, fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss. In this condition he was seen by one of his neighbours, who asked him what his trouble was. The Miser told him of his misfortune; but the other replied, “Don't take it so much to heart, my friend; put a brick into the hole, and take a look at it every day: you won't be any worse off than before, for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use to you.”





THE FOXES AND THE RIVER


A number of Foxes assembled on the bank of a river and wanted to drink; but the current was so strong and the water looked so deep and dangerous that they didn't dare to do so, but stood near the edge encouraging one another not to be afraid. At last one of them, to shame the rest, and show how brave he was, said, “I am not a bit frightened! See, I'll step right into the water!” He had no sooner done so than the current swept him off his feet. When the others saw him being carried down-stream they cried, “Don't go and leave us! Come back and show us where we too can drink with safety.” But he replied, “I'm afraid I can't yet: I want to go to the seaside, and this current will take me there nicely. When I come back I'll show you with pleasure.”





THE HORSE AND THE STAG


There was once a Horse who used to graze in a meadow which he had all to himself. But one day a Stag came into the meadow, and said he had as good a right to feed there as the Horse, and moreover chose all the best places for himself. The Horse, wishing to be revenged upon his unwelcome visitor, went to a man and asked if he would help him to turn out the Stag. “Yes,” said the man, “I will by all means; but I can only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on your back.” The Horse agreed to this, and the two together very soon turned the Stag out of the pasture: but when that was done, the Horse found to his dismay that in the man he had got a master for good.





THE FOX AND THE BRAMBLE


In making his way through a hedge a Fox missed his footing and caught at a Bramble to save himself from falling. Naturally, he got badly scratched, and in disgust he cried to the Bramble, “It was your help I wanted, and see how you have treated me! I'd sooner have fallen outright.” The Bramble, interrupting him, replied, “You must have lost your wits, my friend, to catch at me, who am myself always catching at others.”





THE FOX AND THE SNAKE


A Snake, in crossing a river, was carried away by the current, but managed to wriggle on to a bundle of thorns which was floating by, and was thus carried at a great rate down-stream. A Fox caught sight of it from the bank as it went whirling along, and called out, “Gad! the passenger fits the ship!”





THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE STAG


A Lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food. So he said to his friend the Fox, who came to ask how he did, “My good friend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big Stag, who lives there, to come to my den: I have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag's heart and brains.” The Fox went to the wood and found the Stag and said to him, “My dear sir, you're in luck. You know the Lion, our King: well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts. I hope you won't forget that I was the first to bring you the good news. And now I must be going back to him; and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at the last.” The Stag was highly flattered, and followed the Fox to the Lion's den, suspecting nothing. No sooner had he got inside than the Lion sprang upon him, but he misjudged his spring, and the Stag got away with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood. The Fox was much mortified, and the Lion, too, was dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness. So he begged the Fox to have another try at coaxing the Stag to his den. “It'll be almost impossible this time,” said the Fox, “but I'll try.” And off he went to the wood a second time, and found the Stag resting and trying to recover from his fright. As soon as he saw the Fox he cried, “You scoundrel, what do you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that? Take yourself off, or I'll do you to death with my horns.” But the Fox was entirely shameless. “What a coward you were,” said he; “surely you didn't think the Lion meant any harm? Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit. You have rather disgusted him, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf King instead, unless you come back at once and show you've got some spirit. I promise you he won't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant.” The Stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the Lion made no mistake, but overpowered him, and feasted right royally upon his carcase. The Fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the Lion wasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble. Presently the Lion began searching for them, of course without success: and the Fox, who was watching him, said, “I don't think it's much use your looking for the brains: a creature who twice walked into a Lion's den can't have got any.”





THE MAN WHO LOST HIS SPADE


A Man was engaged in digging over his vineyard, and one day on coming to work he missed his Spade. Thinking it may have been stolen by one of his labourers, he questioned them closely, but they one and all denied any knowledge of it. He was not convinced by their denials, and insisted that they should all go to the town and take oath in a temple that they were not guilty of the theft. This was because he had no great opinion of the simple country deities, but thought that the thief would not pass undetected by the shrewder gods of the town. When they got inside the gates the first thing they heard was the town crier proclaiming a reward for information about a thief who had stolen something from the city temple. “Well,” said the Man to himself, “it strikes me I had better go back home again. If these town gods can't detect the thieves who steal from their own temples, it's scarcely likely they can tell me who stole my Spade.”





THE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER


A Fowler caught a Partridge in his nets, and was just about to wring its neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and said, “Do not kill me, but let me live and I will repay you for your kindness by decoying other partridges into your nets.” “No,” said the Fowler, “I will not spare you. I was going to kill you anyhow, and after that treacherous speech you thoroughly deserve your fate.”





THE RUNAWAY SLAVE


A Slave, being discontented with his lot, ran away from his master. He was soon missed by the latter, who lost no time in mounting his horse and setting out in pursuit of the fugitive. He presently came up with him, and the Slave, in the hope of avoiding capture, slipped into a treadmill and hid himself there. “Aha,” said his master, “that's the very place for you, my man!”





THE HUNTER AND THE WOODMAN


A Hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion, and, catching sight presently of a Woodman engaged in felling a tree, he went up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion's footprints anywhere about, or if he knew where his den was. The Woodman answered, “If you will come with me, I will show you the lion himself.” The Hunter turned pale with fear, and his teeth chattered as he replied, “Oh, I'm not looking for the lion, thanks, but only for his tracks.”





THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE


An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the Eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.

One good turn deserves another.





THE ROGUE AND THE ORACLE


A Rogue laid a wager that he would prove the Oracle at Delphi to be untrustworthy by procuring from it a false reply to an inquiry by himself. So he went to the temple on the appointed day with a small bird in his hand, which he concealed under the folds of his cloak, and asked whether what he held in his hand were alive or dead. If the Oracle said “dead,” he meant to produce the bird alive: if the reply was “alive,” he intended to wring its neck and show it to be dead. But the Oracle was one too many for him, for the answer he got was this: “Stranger, whether the thing that you hold in your hand be alive or dead is a matter that depends entirely on your own will.”





THE HORSE AND THE ASS


A Horse, proud of his fine harness, met an Ass on the high-road. As the Ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass, the Horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster. The Ass held his peace, but did not forget the other's insolence. Not long afterwards the Horse became broken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer. One day, as he was drawing a dung-cart, he met the Ass again, who in turn derided him and said, “Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who were so proud! Where are all your gay trappings now?”





THE DOG CHASING A WOLF


A Dog was chasing a Wolf, and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow he was, and what strong legs he had, and how quickly they covered the ground. “Now, there's this Wolf,” he said to himself, “what a poor creature he is: he's no match for me, and he knows it and so he runs away.” But the Wolf looked round just then and said, “Don't you imagine I'm running away from you, my friend: it's your master I'm afraid of.”





GRIEF AND HIS DUE


When Jupiter was assigning the various gods their privileges, it so happened that Grief was not present with the rest: but when all had received their share, he too entered and claimed his due. Jupiter was at a loss to know what to do, for there was nothing left for him. However, at last he decided that to him should belong the tears that are shed for the dead. Thus it is the same with Grief as it is with the other gods. The more devoutly men render to him his due, the more lavish is he of that which he has to bestow. It is not well, therefore, to mourn long for the departed; else Grief, whose sole pleasure is in such mourning, will be quick to send fresh cause for tears.





THE HAWK, THE KITE, AND THE PIGEONS


The Pigeons in a certain dovecote were persecuted by a Kite, who every now and then swooped down and carried off one of their number. So they invited a Hawk into the dovecote to defend them against their enemy. But they soon repented of their folly: for the Hawk killed more of them in a day than the Kite had done in a year.





THE WOMAN AND THE FARMER


A Woman, who had lately lost her husband, used to go every day to his grave and lament her loss. A Farmer, who was engaged in ploughing not far from the spot, set eyes upon the Woman and desired to have her for his wife: so he left his plough and came and sat by her side, and began to shed tears himself. She asked him why he wept; and he replied, “I have lately lost my wife, who was very dear to me, and tears ease my grief.” “And I,” said she, “have lost my husband.” And so for a while they mourned in silence. Then he said, “Since you and I are in like case, shall we not do well to marry and live together? I shall take the place of your dead husband, and you, that of my dead wife.” The Woman consented to the plan, which indeed seemed reasonable enough: and they dried their tears. Meanwhile, a thief had come and stolen the oxen which the Farmer had left with his plough. On discovering the theft, he beat his breast and loudly bewailed his loss. When the Woman heard his cries, she came and said, “Why, are you weeping still?” To which he replied: “Yes, and I mean it this time.”





PROMETHEUS AND THE MAKING OF MAN


At the bidding of Jupiter, Prometheus set about the creation of Man and the other animals. Jupiter, seeing that Mankind, the only rational creatures, were far outnumbered by the irrational beasts, bade him redress the balance by turning some of the latter into men. Prometheus did as he was bidden, and this is the reason why some people have the forms of men but the souls of beasts.





THE SWALLOW AND THE CROW


A Swallow was once boasting to a Crow about her birth. “I was once a princess,” said she, “the daughter of a King of Athens, but my husband used me cruelly, and cut out my tongue for a slight fault. Then, to protect me from further injury, I was turned by Juno into a bird.” “You chatter quite enough as it is,” said the Crow. “What you would have been like if you hadn't lost your tongue, I can't think.”





THE HUNTER AND THE HORSEMAN


A Hunter went out after game, and succeeded in catching a hare, which he was carrying home with him when he met a man on horseback, who said to him, “You have had some sport I see, sir,” and offered to buy it. The Hunter readily agreed; but the Horseman had no sooner got the hare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full gallop. The Hunter ran after him for some little distance; but it soon dawned upon him that he had been tricked, and he gave up trying to overtake the Horseman, and, to save his face, called after him as loud as he could, “All right, sir, all right, take your hare: it was meant all along as a present.”





THE GOATHERD AND THE WILD GOATS


A Goatherd was tending his goats out at pasture when he saw a number of Wild Goats approach and mingle with his flock. At the end of the day he drove them home and put them all into the pen together. Next day the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual: so he kept them at home in the pen, and fed them there. He only gave his own goats enough food to keep them from starving, but he gave the Wild Goats as much as they could eat and more; for he was very anxious for them to stay, and he thought that if he fed them well they wouldn't want to leave him. When the weather improved, he took them all out to pasture again; but no sooner had they got near the hills than the Wild Goats broke away from the flock and scampered off. The Goatherd was very much disgusted at this, and roundly abused them for their ingratitude. “Rascals!” he cried, “to run away like that after the way I've treated you!” Hearing this, one of them turned round and said, “Oh, yes, you treated us all right—too well, in fact; it was just that that put us on our guard. If you treat newcomers like ourselves so much better than your own flock, it's more than likely that, if another lot of strange goats joined yours, we should then be neglected in favour of the last comers.”





THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE SWALLOW


A Swallow, conversing with a Nightingale, advised her to quit the leafy coverts where she made her home, and to come and live with men, like herself, and nest under the shelter of their roofs. But the Nightingale replied, “Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among men: but the memory of the cruel wrongs I then suffered makes them hateful to me, and never again will I approach their dwellings.”

The scene of past sufferings revives painful memories.





THE TRAVELLER AND FORTUNE


A Traveller, exhausted with fatigue after a long journey, sank down at the very brink of a deep well and presently fell asleep. He was within an ace of falling in, when Dame Fortune appeared to him and touched him on the shoulder, cautioning him to move further away. “Wake up, good sir, I pray you,” she said; “had you fallen into the well, the blame would have been thrown not on your own folly but on me, Fortune.”
