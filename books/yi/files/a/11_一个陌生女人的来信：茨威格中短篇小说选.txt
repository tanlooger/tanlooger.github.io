灼人的秘密

伙伴

机车沙哑地吼叫着，塞默林[1]到了。黑色的列车在山上银白色灯光的照耀下停了一分钟，下来几个穿着五颜六色衣服的乘客，又上了几个人。到处是恼人的噪音。接着，前面的机车又沙哑地嘶鸣起来，扯动黑色的车链，嘎嘎地开了过去，冲进隧道的洞口。广漠的景色又纯净地展现出来了，清晰的背景，被湿润的风吹得分外明亮。

下车的人中有一位年轻人，他那考究的衣着，带有天然弹性的步履，给人以好感。他迅速地走在别人前边，叫了一辆去旅馆的马车。马儿不慌不忙地在上坡路上得得地走着。空气里充满春意，那只有五六月才特有的洁白而轻盈的浮云，像穿着白色衣裳的轻佻的小伙子，在蓝色的空中嬉戏奔跑，时而躲藏在高山背后，时而互相拥抱，又再度逃开，有时像手绢似的揉成一团，有时又散成丝片，末了又戏弄地给群山头上戴上白色的帽子。风在高空奔驰，狂暴不羁地摇动着细长的沐雨的树枝，直摇得根根枝丫咔咔作响，飞落下千百颗晶莹的水滴。有时仿佛从山里飘来清凉的雪的芬芳，随后又让人呼吸到一种又甜又冲鼻的气息。空中和地上的一切都在骚动，显得极度的烦躁不宁。马匹轻轻地喷着鼻息，往已是下坡的路上跑去。小铃铛在前边叮叮当当作响。

一到旅馆，这位年轻人就立即跑到旅客登记处，匆匆地稍一浏览，马上就失望了。“我干吗到这里来？”他开始烦躁不安地自忖，“光在这里的山上待着，没有社交，这比在办公室还烦人。显然，我来得不是太早就是太晚，每逢假期，我的运气总是不好，登记本上没有一个熟悉的名字。哪怕有几个女人在这里也好，那就可以来次小小的必要时甚至是真挚的调情，而不至于索然寡味地度过这个星期。”这位年轻人是个男爵，出身于名望不是那么太高的奥地利官僚贵族，现在总督府供职。他这次短短的休假并没有特别必要，只是因为他的同事都休过了一星期春假，而他又并不愿意把自己的一周假期送给国家。他虽然不乏才干，却具有一种喜爱社交的秉性，喜欢在各种人物的圈子里出头露面，并深知自己对于孤独是一筹莫展的。他从来不喜欢深居简出，尽可能地避免只身独处，因为他根本不愿意闭门反躬自省。他知道，他需要人的摩擦面，以便使他内在的才华、他心底的热情得以放纵，并燃起火光，而他一人独处时则是冷冰冰的，毫无用处，就像那装在匣子里的火柴。

他沮丧地在空无一人的前厅里踱来踱去，时而心不在焉地翻翻报纸，时而又在音乐室的钢琴上弹一曲华尔兹，不过手不由己，老是弹不出正确的旋律。后来他烦躁地坐下，凝视着窗外。窗外夜幕正缓缓下垂，灰色的雾霭像蒸气一样从松林中升腾起来。他心烦意乱百无聊赖地在那里待了一个小时后走进了餐厅。

餐厅里才只有几张桌子坐了人，他都匆匆地投以一瞥。毫无所获！只有那边的一位教练——他是在跑马场认识的——漫不经心地招呼了他，还有一张面孔在环城路[2]上见过，此外，什么也没有了。没有女人，没有任何能够引起一次——即便是短暂的也好——钟情的对象。他本来就沮丧的情绪变得更加烦躁。像他这样的年轻人，他们标致的面孔常使他们获得成功，他们心里总是在为一次新的相遇，一次新的经历做好准备，他们总是急不可待地憧憬那未知的艳遇，他们对任何看来意外的事情都不会吃惊，因为一切早就在他们预料之中了，他们的眼睛不会放过任何性爱的东西，因为他们投向每个女人的第一瞥目光，就是从肉欲上打量的，不管她是朋友的妻子，还是给他开门的女仆。如果以某种草率的鄙视态度把这些人称作追逐女人的能手，那么无意中就会使这个字眼包含多少由观察而得来的真理啊！因为在他们身上确实集中了狩猎者各种强烈的本能：侦察、兴奋和心灵的冷酷。他们的举止总是落落大方，时刻准备着，一心想寻花问柳，并穷追不舍，不达目的决不罢休。他们总是充满激情，但不是恋人那种高尚的激情，而是赌徒那种冷酷的、谋略的、危险的激情。他们当中有一些固执的人，他们不仅把青年时期，而且单是由于等待机缘就把整个一生变成无穷无尽的追逐冒险，他们把一天分解成几百次小的官能享乐——马路上的一瞥、一个瞬息即逝的微笑、对坐时轻轻触到的膝头——把一年又分解为几百个这样的日子。对他们来说，官能享乐就是永远潺潺流动的、富于滋养的、充满刺激的生活的源泉。

然而这里却没有一个可供玩弄的对手，这一点，这位在用目光狩猎的人马上就看清了。宛如一个赌徒手里拿着牌，满怀信心地坐在绿色的赌桌旁，却等不到一个对手。对一个赌徒来说，任何刺激都没有这种刺激最使人恼火的了。男爵要了一份报纸，他的目光阴郁地在字行上移动，但思想却是麻木的，像是醉酒似的在这些铅字上磕磕绊绊。

忽然他听见背后有衣服的窸窣声和一个略为有点生气的装腔作势的声音：“Mais taistoi donc[3]，埃德加！”

一个穿着绸衣的女人走过他桌旁，衣服发出轻微的窸窣声，旁边投下高大而丰腴的身影，她后面跟着一个脸色苍白的小男孩，他穿着黑丝绒上装，目光好奇地扫了他一眼。这两个人在对面为他们留着的桌旁坐下，孩子显然竭力想使自己的举止合乎礼节，但是从他不安静的黑眼珠来看却又做不到。这位夫人——年轻男爵的注意力全在她身上——穿着十分整齐和优雅，他非常喜欢她这种类型，这是一个快要进入中年的犹太女人，身材显得稍为丰满了些，热情充沛，可又善于把自己的热情隐藏在高雅的伤感后面。起初他还不敢看她的眼睛，只是欣赏她那两道弯弯的、美丽的眉毛，在她那柔嫩的鼻子之上呈一弧形，那秀丽的鼻子虽然显示了她的种族，但这高贵的造型却也使她的轮廓显得分明和可爱。她的头发如同她丰满的身体上一切女性的东西一样，长得特别浓密。看来她对自己的美貌颇为自信，对于种种仰慕早已司空见惯。她轻声地点了饭菜，并教训正在叮叮当当玩叉子的男孩——做这一切的时候，她装出一副漫不经心的神态，对男爵小心翼翼投来的目光，装出不在意的样子，而实际上正是由于他那目不转睛的眼光才迫使她这般拘束和小心的。

男爵阴沉的脸一下子变得豁然开朗起来。眉开眼笑，精神焕发，皱纹平整了，肌肉放开了，因此他的身材也一下子变得魁梧了，眼睛闪闪发光。他同那些需要男人在场才能焕发自己全部力量的女人完全一样，只有情欲的刺激才能把他的精力全部调动起来。潜伏在他心里的猎手嗅出了这里有猎物。他的目光挑战似的搜寻她的目光，要与之相遇。她的目光闪烁着犹豫的神态，有时在移动中与他的目光交叉，但却从不做什么明确的回答。他觉得她的嘴角有时也泛起一丝微笑。不过这一切都是那么模棱两可，而使他激动的，却正是这种不可捉摸的神情。唯一使他觉得有希望的，是她的目光常常在扫视，这意味着反抗和拘束，再加上她同孩子的谈话显得出奇的谨慎，这显然是做给一个观众看的。他感觉到，过分强调这种惹人注意的镇定正是用来掩饰她意马心猿的一种手法。他自己也激动了：这场戏已经开场了。他巧妙地拖长吃饭的时间，目光几乎不停地把这位夫人紧紧盯了半个小时，直到他默画了她脸上的每一根线条，能无形地触摸她丰腴身体的每个部位为止。外面天色更暗了，大片雨云向树林伸出灰色的双手，树林像孩子似的，因为恐怖而呻吟起来，挤入屋内的阴影也越来越浓了，沉默使屋里的人越加感到窘迫。他觉察到，在寂静的威胁下，母亲同孩子的谈话变得越来越勉强，越来越不自然，话快说完了。这时他决定进行一次试探：他第一个站起身来，经过她的身旁慢慢向门口走去，久久凝望着室外的景色。到了门口，他像是忘了什么东西似的，突然把头转过来，一下子就逮住了她：她活泼的目光正在望着他的背影呢。

这情景刺激了他，他在前厅里等待着。不一会儿她来了，拉着男孩。路过时顺手翻了翻几本杂志，给孩子看了几张图片。当男爵像是偶然地走到桌旁，装着去找本杂志，实际是为了再进一步窥视她那湿润晶莹的目光，或许有机会同她搭讪时，她就转过身子，轻轻拍着她儿子的肩膀说：“Viens，埃德加！Au lit！”[4]说着就冷冷地从他身边走了过去。男爵略为扫兴地目送着她。本来他曾计划要在今天晚上结识她的，而她这毫不留情的态度使他失望了。但归根结底这抗拒之中包含着诱惑，而恰恰是这种让人捉摸不定的态度刺激了他的欲望。无论如何，他已经有了伙伴，这出戏可以演出了。

神速的友谊

第二天早晨，男爵走进大厅，他看见那位漂亮女人的孩子正在那儿和两位开电梯的仆人聊得起劲，孩子正给他们看卡尔·梅依[5]的一本书里的插图。他妈妈不在，显然还在梳妆哩。男爵现在才仔细地观察这个男孩。这是个腼腆的孩子，发育得不太好，有点神经质，大约十二岁，手脚老是不停，有一双到处窥视的黑眼睛。如同这样年龄的孩子常有的那样，他显出无缘无故受到惊吓的样子，就像刚被叫醒又突然被置于陌生的环境中似的。他的面孔不算不好看，但是还没有定型，在他身上成人和儿童的斗争还刚刚开始，胜负未定；他脸上的一切好像是手捏出来的，尚未成型，线条轮廓很不分明，只是把苍白和不安糅合在一起。此外他正处于那种不利的年龄，这时他们的衣服总不合身，袖子和裤子在瘦削的肢体上松弛地晃动着，而他们也从没有去注意修饰外表，讲究穿着。

这男孩在这里犹豫不决地晃来晃去，样子怪可怜的。他站在这里老碍别人的事。门房被他用各种问题纠缠得烦死了，一会儿就把他推开，但是一会儿他又挡住了大门，显然他缺少友好的伙伴。孩子喜欢问东问西，因此就去找旅馆的仆役。要是他们正好有时间，就回答他，但当看见有人来了，或者有什么紧急的事要做，谈话就立即中断。男爵面带笑容，饶有兴味地注视着这个不幸的男孩，孩子对一切都好奇地打量着，但一切都不友好地躲开他。有一次男爵紧紧抓住了这个好奇的目光，但是那黑溜溜的眼睛一旦发现自己探索的眼光被抓住，就立即怯生生地将目光收了回去，躲在下垂的眼皮后面。男爵觉得这很有意思。他开始对男孩产生了兴趣，他自忖，这孩子仅仅是由于胆怯才这么腼腆的，能不能把他作为去接近那女人最迅速的媒介呢？无论如何，他要试一试。男孩刚刚又跑到门外去了，他悄悄地跟着。这孩子需要温柔与爱抚，只见他抚摸着白马的玫瑰色的鼻孔。可他真没运气，马车夫也相当粗暴地把他撵走了。现在他又伤心又无聊地荡来荡去，空虚的眼神里含着一丝儿悲哀。这时男爵就同他搭话了：

“喂，小家伙，你喜欢这儿吗？”他突如其来地说，竭力使他的口气平易近人，毫无架子。

孩子的脸涨得绯红，怯生生地在发愣。有点害怕似的用手按着心口，难为情地来回转着身子。一位陌生的先生和他谈话聊天，这在他的生活中还是第一次。

“谢谢，很喜欢。”他结结巴巴地说了这么一句，最后一个字只在喉咙里咕噜了一下，就咽了回去。

“我觉得很奇怪，”男爵笑着说，“这本来就是个很乏味的地方，尤其是对像你这样的年轻人。你整天干什么呢？”这男孩依然不知所措，不能爽快地回答。这位漂亮的陌生先生来找他这个无人过问的孩子聊天，这真可能吗？这使他既羞涩又骄傲。他费力地鼓足了勇气。

“我看书，然后我们散步，有时候我们也坐车，妈妈和我。我是来这里休养的，我生过病，大夫说我得多晒太阳。”最后几句话他已经说得相当镇定了。孩子们对自己生病总感到很骄傲，因为危险使得他们在家人眼里显得倍加宝贵。

“是啊，太阳对于像你这样的年轻人非常必要，它一定会把你晒得黑黑的。但是你也不能整天坐着晒太阳，你应该到处跑跑，痛快地玩玩，也可以来点儿恶作剧。我觉得你太老实了。你看起来像是个整天待在家里、手里捧着又厚又大的书本啃个不停的书呆子。我记得我在你这么大的时候简直是个淘气包，每晚回家时裤子都撕破了。你别太老实了。”

孩子下意识地笑了，这一笑可解除了他的恐惧心理。他本想也说几句，但觉得在一个如此友好亲切的陌生先生面前这样随便就显得太放肆了。别人说话他从来不插嘴，而且老是容易发窘；现在由于幸福和羞怯，他更不知所措。他很希望和这位先生的谈天继续下去，可是却什么话也想不出来。幸好这时旅馆的那条大黄狗走了过来，嗅了嗅他们俩人，并乖乖地摇着尾巴让人抚摸。

“你喜欢狗吗？”男爵问。

“噢，很喜欢。我祖母在巴登[6]的别墅里养了一条狗，我们在那里住的时候，它整天都跟着我。不过我们只是夏天才到那里去玩。”

“我家里，在我们庄园里，有二十多条狗，如果在这里你听话，我就送你一只狗，送你一只白耳朵的棕毛小狗。你要吗？”

孩子高兴得脸都红了。

“嗯，要的。”

这句话脱口而出，说得热切而贪婪，但接着又胆怯地，像吓着一样，吞吞吐吐地说出他的担心。

“可是妈妈不会同意的。她说她不能让人在家里养狗。狗太使人讨厌了。”

男爵不觉喜形于色，终于把话题转到了他妈妈身上。

“妈妈那么严厉吗？”

孩子思索着，对他注视了片刻，似乎在自问，对这位陌生的先生是否可以信赖。回答是谨慎的：

“不，妈妈并不严厉。因为我刚生了病，现在她什么都允许我的。甚至她也许会同意我养条狗呢。”

“要我为你说情吗？”

“要，请您给说说吧！”男孩高兴得叫了起来，“这样妈妈肯定会答应的。这条狗是什么样的？白耳朵，是吗？它会把捕获物找到叼回来吗？”

“会，它什么都会。”男爵如此迅速地就从男孩的眼里发现了闪烁着的热切的光辉，他为此粲然一笑。开始时的拘谨一下就消失了，由于害怕而收敛起来的热情一下子就喷涌而出。这个原来腼腆的、羞涩的孩子转瞬间就变成一个热情嬉闹的男孩子。男爵不由自主地想，要是那位母亲也是这样，在胆怯之后也这么热烈就好了。刚这么想，那男孩就蹦到他身上，向他提出了二十个问题：

“这只狗叫什么名字？”

“叫卡罗。”

“卡罗！”孩子欢天喜地地叫道。

大概他说每句话都在笑，都在欢叫，被这喜出望外的喜讯陶醉了。事情竟进展得出人预料地神速，连男爵本人都感到很吃惊。他决心趁热打铁。他邀请这孩子跟他一块散散步，而这可怜的孩子呢，几个星期以来就渴望着有人跟他一起玩玩，听了这个邀请，他简直欣喜若狂。这孩子被他的新朋友用一些像是偶然想到的问题所引诱，喋喋不休地把什么事都讲了出来。一会儿工夫，男爵对这个家庭的一切就一清二楚了，尤其是知道了埃德加是维也纳某律师的独生子，出身于一个富有的犹太资产阶级家庭。他通过巧妙的询问，马上就打听到，他母亲对塞默林完全不感兴趣，她曾抱怨这里没有谈得来的朋友，他甚至觉得，从埃德加回答他妈妈是不是喜欢他爸爸这个问题时的支支吾吾的神气，可以推测到关系准不那么妙。他对自己的做法几乎感到羞愧了，他轻而易举地就从这天真无邪的孩子嘴里把这些细微的家庭秘密套了出来。因为埃德加完全信任了他的新朋友，并为自己讲的事情居然能引起一个大人的兴趣而感到自豪。再加上散步时男爵曾把胳膊搭在他的肩上，大家都会看到他和一个大人的关系是多么亲密，埃德加那颗幼稚的心灵由于这种自豪感而剧烈地跳动起来，他渐渐忘了自己是个孩子，无拘无束地像同年龄相仿的人那样滔滔不绝地谈个不休。从他的谈吐中可以看出，埃德加很聪明，正如大多数病弱的孩子一样，由于跟成人在一起的时间比跟同学在一起的时间多而有些早熟，对于自己倾慕或敌视的人或事，反应出奇的激烈。他对任何事情都不能心平气和，谈到任何人或事时，不是特别喜爱，就是极端仇恨，甚至恨到脸都会扭曲得凶狠、难看。也许因为刚生了病的原因吧，他说话带点粗野和突如其来的味道，这使他的言谈如火样的炽热，看来他的笨拙只不过是对自己激情的一种恐惧，一种他费力加以压抑的恐惧而已。

男爵轻而易举地得到了他的信任。仅仅半个小时，他就掌握了这颗火热的不安地颤动着的童心。欺骗孩子，欺骗这些难得被人爱的天真无邪的孩子真是轻而易举的事。他只要把自己的身份忘掉就行了，这样同孩子说起话来就会自然而然，无拘无束，使孩子也觉得他是个小伙伴，于是几分钟之后两人之间任何感情上的距离也没有了。埃德加简直欣喜若狂。在这寂寞的地方突然找到了一位朋友，一位多好的朋友啊！他把维也纳的小男孩全都忘了，连同他们细声细气的声音和幼稚可笑的废话，他们的形象好像都让位给这位新的大朋友了。当这位大朋友告别时又一次邀请他明天上午再来的时候，当这位新朋友像大哥哥似的从老远向他招手的时候，他自豪得连心都要跳出来了。这一刻也许是他生活中最美好的时刻。欺骗孩子真是易如反掌。——男爵向这个跑着走开的孩子微笑着。现在他有了介绍人。他知道，孩子一定会去讲给他母亲听，一直要把他母亲折腾得筋疲力尽方才罢休，他准要每句话都复述一遍——这时他怡然自得地想到，他在提到她的时候加了一些奉承话，譬如每次他都用埃德加的“漂亮的妈妈”这个词来称呼。这位健谈的孩子不把他妈妈和他引到一起是不会安静的。对这一点他确信无疑。他无需自己动手就可以缩小他和这位漂亮的女人之间的距离，现在他可以安安静静地做他的梦，眺望一番景色，因为他知道，一双热烈的小手就会为他筑起一座通向她的心扉的桥梁。

三重唱

几小时以后证实，这个计划是非常出色的，每个细节都获得了成功。当年轻的男爵故意稍稍晚些进入餐厅的时候，埃德加从椅子上一跃而起，急忙向他致意，面带幸福的微笑，向他招手。同时拉着他母亲的袖子，慌张而激动地在劝说她，一面以引人注目的手势指着男爵。他母亲不好意思地红着脸斥责孩子这些任性的举止，可是终究还是不能不往那边瞧瞧，以照顾孩子的意愿。男爵立即抓住这个机会恭恭敬敬地鞠了一躬。这样彼此就算认识了。她不得不回礼。但此后就把头埋得更低，只顾吃她的东西，整个用餐时间都小心翼翼地避免再往那边看。埃德加可不是这样，他不住地望着那边，有一次他甚至想和那边说话，这种放肆的行为立即遭到了他母亲的严厉责备。吃过晚饭以后他就该去睡觉了，这时他和妈妈悄悄说了好一阵子话，结果他的热切请求得到允许，于是就走到另一张桌子去向他朋友道别。男爵对他说了几句亲切的话，这又使这孩子的眼睛里露出了光辉，他和他聊了几分钟。突然男爵巧妙地把话一转，站起来向另一张桌子转过身去，祝贺邻座那位有点不知所措的女士有这么个聪明伶俐的儿子，说他上午跟她儿子在一起十分愉快——埃德加站在旁边，快乐和骄傲使他的脸都红了——又问起孩子健康，问得十分详细，提了许多具体问题，迫使母亲只好一一作答。这样他们就不可遏止地进行了一次较长的谈话，男孩对此感到非常幸福，并以一种敬畏的心情倾听着。男爵做了自我介绍，并相信觉察到他那响亮的名字对这位爱慕虚荣的女人产生了某种印象。总之，她对他非常彬彬有礼，尽管她丝毫未失自己的尊严，甚至还先向他提出告别，她抱歉地说，这是因为孩子的缘故。

孩子激烈反对，说他不困，愿意通宵不睡。可是他母亲已经向男爵伸出了手，他尊敬地吻了它。

这一夜埃德加睡得很不好。他心里一团乱麻，既有极度的幸福，又有稚气的绝望。因为在他的生活里，今天发生了新的事情。他第一次进入了大人的行列之中。他半睡半醒，忘掉了自己的童年，似乎自己一下子长大了。直到现在，他一直孤单地受着教育，常常生病，没有几个朋友。他需要温暖爱抚，但是除了父母和仆人之外，别无一人，而父母亲也很少照看他。对于爱的威力，如果只是根据其起因，而不是根据它产生之前的张力，不是根据那空虚而黑暗的空间——这空间在心灵发生重大事件之前充满了失望和孤寂——来判断，就必定会判断错的。一种超重的、没有使用过的感情已在这里期待着，现在它伸开双臂向第一个似乎赢得它的人扑过去。埃德加在黑暗中躺着，心里快乐异常，思绪万千。他又想笑，又想哭。因为他喜欢这个人，他还从未爱过一个朋友，没有爱过父亲和母亲，就连上帝也没有爱过哩。他少年时代全部幼稚的热情，现在紧紧地拥抱着这个人的形象。两小时前他连他的名字还不知道呢。

他很聪明，不会为这突如其来的、独特的新友谊而发窘。但使他感到十分惶惑不安的却是觉得自己微不足道，无足轻重。“我配得上做他的朋友吗？我，一个十二岁的孩子，还在上学，晚上总要比别人更早地被打发去睡觉。”这些想法在折磨着他。“我能为他做些什么呢？我能对他有些什么帮助呢？”他想以什么东西来表达自己的心意，却痛苦地感到力不从心。这使他很不愉快。往常，每当他喜欢某个同学，第一件事就是把他书桌里宝贵的小玩意儿，像邮票、石头之类童年的财产分几样给这位同学，这些东西，他昨天还觉得非常了不起，魅力非凡，现在一下子就变得一钱不值、微不足道和不屑一顾了。那么他怎样才能给这位他连“你”字都不敢称呼的新朋友一些宝贵的东西呢？用什么办法才能表达自己的感情呢？他越来越因为自己的矮小，自己的半大不小、不成熟，为自己还是个十二岁的孩子而苦恼，他从来还从来没有因为自己是孩子而如此痛恨地诅咒过自己呢，也从来没有如此殷切地渴望长成他梦想的那样：高大、强壮，长成一个男子汉，一个像别人一样的大人！

这些惶惑不安的念头，很快就编织成了这个崭新的成人世界的色彩缤纷的美梦。埃德加终于带着微笑入睡，但他老想着明天的约会，这破坏了他的酣睡。他怕去晚了，所以第二天七点钟就惊醒了。他急急忙忙穿上衣服，到母亲房里去问了早安。这使他母亲十分惊讶，过去她总要费好大的气力才能把他从床上叫起来。还没等她发问，他就跑下楼去了。他一直焦急地晃荡到九点，连早饭都忘了，一心想着别让他的朋友为这次散步等得太久。

九点半，男爵终于潇洒地走了过来，他当然早就把这次约会忘在九霄云外。但是现在因为孩子热切地向他跑来，他也不得不对这股激情报以微笑，并表示准备遵守他的诺言。他又挎着孩子的胳膊，带着这个神采奕奕的孩子走上走下，只是委婉地、但是坚决地拒绝现在就一起去散步。他好像在等待什么，至少他那心神不定的、扫视着大门的目光说明了这点。突然他全身一振，埃德加的妈妈走进了前厅，一边回答他的问候，一边亲切地朝他俩走来。当她得知埃德加当作什么了不起的秘密瞒着她想和男爵一起散步的计划时，就微笑着同意了，并爽快地接受了男爵要她同去散步的邀请。

埃德加立即露出一副愁眉苦脸的样子，咬着嘴唇。多恼人，她偏偏现在走来了！这次散步本该只属于他一个人的，即使是他自己把他的朋友介绍给妈妈的，但这只不过是表示他的一种盛情而已，这并不表明他愿意和她共有这位朋友。当他看到男爵对母亲那股殷勤劲儿时，他心里就激起了某种妒意。

他们三人一起散步，由于他们两人都对他表示了出奇的关心，因而在孩子的心里更滋长了一种觉得自己很了不起的、突然身价百倍的危险感觉。埃德加几乎成了谈话的中心。母亲有点假惺惺地对他苍白的脸色和他的神经质表示忧虑，而男爵却又笑嘻嘻地反对这种看法，并赞许他的“朋友”——他是这么称呼他的——的可爱。这是埃德加的最美好的时刻。他获得了他整个童年时期所没有得到的权利。他可以同大人一起说话而不立即受到申斥，要他住嘴，他甚至可以表示各种各样的冒失的要求，而这些他若在这以前提出来就准会挨上好一顿臭骂。他认为自己业已长大成人了，当这种自欺欺人的感情在他的心里越来越自信地滋生起来时，孩子的这种情绪是毫不奇怪的。在他光明的梦境里，童年已经被远远地甩在了身后，就像抛掉一件不合身的衣服那样。

中午，男爵应越来越友好的埃德加的母亲之邀，坐在她的桌上。由vis-à-vis[7]到一起并坐，由认识变成了友谊。三重唱正在进行，女声、男声、童声这三种声音配合得十分协调。

进攻

现在这位没有耐心的猎手觉得是时候了，是蹑手蹑脚地挨近他的猎物的时候了。在这种事情上他不喜欢老是这种亲热的三重唱。三个人在一起聊聊天，当然很惬意，但是归根结底聊天并非他的目的。他知道男女之间的情欲，如果成了戴假面具游戏的社交，就会耽误官能享受，就会使语言失去激情，使进攻缺乏火力。要使她透过谈话了解他的本意，至于这个本意是什么，他已经使她了解得一清二楚了，对此他是很有把握的。

他对这个女人所打的主意恐怕不至于徒劳无功，成事的或然率很大：她正当那种关键性的年龄，这时候一个女人对自己素来忠于一个不喜欢的丈夫开始感到后悔了，美貌正在消逝，风韵所余无多，在母性和女人之间她还不能做出刻不容缓的最后一次抉择。生活，好像早就已经有了答案的生活，此刻又一次成了疑问，意志的磁针最后一次在渴望官能享受和彻底断绝欲念之间颤动着。一个女人面临着一个危险的决断：是为了她自己的命运，还是为了孩子的命运，是做女人还是做母亲。男爵对这一切都一目了然，他感到他已经觉察到她的这种危险的动摇了。她谈话当中总是忘记提及她丈夫，实际上心里对她孩子也了解得非常之少。她杏仁般的双眸里有一种百无聊赖的影子，在伤感的面纱下，半遮半露地掩饰着她的情欲。男爵决定迅速采取行动，但同时又避免急不可待的样子。相反，像垂钓者引逗地抽回钩子一样，在他这方面，他又做出一副极其冷淡的样子，虽然实际上是他在追别人，但却要让别人来追他。他决定表现得高傲一些，竭力强调他们社会地位不同。他觉得只要突出他的高傲、显示他的外貌、强调他那响亮的贵族姓氏，以及做出冷冰冰的举止，就可以将这温柔、丰满、漂亮的肉体弄到手。这个想法撩拨得他心里奇痒难熬。

这场热烈的戏已使他兴奋异常。因此他强迫自己小心从事。他一下午都待在自己房间里，美滋滋地相信她在找他，在惦记着他，但是，他未露面并未引起她的注意，她本来就想避开他的。可是这使可怜的孩子难受极了。整个下午埃德加都茫然困惑、若有所失；他以男孩子所特有的那种执拗的忠诚，在漫长的好几小时里始终痴心地等着他。他觉得走掉或者独自做点什么事都是一种罪过。他茫然无主地在过道里踱来踱去，天色越晚，他心里越是怏怏不乐。他心绪不宁，想入非非，他梦到一次事故，梦到不知不觉中受到的一次侮辱，由于焦急和恐惧他差点儿哭出声来。

男爵晚上去吃饭的时候，受到了热烈欢迎。埃德加不顾母亲告诫，叫了他，不理会别人的惊讶，朝他奔去，用他瘦削的双臂紧紧抱住他的胸部。“您在哪儿啦？您在哪儿待着啦？”他匆忙地叫道，“我们到处找您。”母亲不高兴把自己扯进去，所以脸红了。她相当严厉地说：“Sois sage，Edgar，Assieds-toi！”[8]（她总是和他说法语，虽然她的法语讲得并不自如，一碰到难表达的句子还感到很吃力。）埃德加顺从了，但还在向男爵刨根问底。“你别忘了，男爵先生可以做他愿意做的事。也许他讨厌我们跟他在一起呢。”这回她自己把自己扯进去了。男爵立刻就愉快地感到，这种责备正是为了恭维。

猎手兴奋起来了。他狂喜、激动，那么迅速地在这里找到了猎物的真正足迹，他感到它就在他的射程之内了。他的眼睛炯炯发光，神采飞扬，口若悬河，滔滔不绝，连他自己也不明所以，他同每个情欲旺盛的人一样，当他知道讨得了女人欢心时，便风度飘逸，潇洒自如，就像有些演员，当他们知道面前的观众对他们着迷时，就劲头倍增。他在朋友们中间是个讲春宫故事的能手，而今天——这时他喝了几杯为庆祝这新友谊而要的香槟酒——讲得更为出色。他自诩为一位地位很高的英国贵族朋友的客人，在印度打过猎。他很聪明地选了这个题目，那是因为这题材是轻松的，而且他可以从旁观察这些富有异国情调的逸事，这些她所无法企及的事情在这个女人身上所引起的激动。听了这个故事最最着迷的，首先还是埃德加，他的眼睛也由于兴奋而显得炯炯有神。他忘了吃，忘了喝，凝视着这位侃侃而谈的人。他从未希望真正能够见到一位有过亲身经历的人，讲述他只从书本上才读到过的那些惊人的险遇，什么猎虎啦、棕色人啦、印度人啦，以及把千百人研为齑粉的、可怕的Dschagernat[9]的轮子啦，等等。直到现在他还从来不相信真的会有这样的人，正如他从来没把童话国当成真的国家一样。此刻，他心里突然第一次涌现出一个辽阔的世界。他目不转睛地盯着他的朋友，屏住呼吸，凝视着他面前那双曾经打死过一只老虎的手。他什么都不敢问，随后他说话的声音异常兴奋。在他驰骋的想象里，他的大朋友成了故事里的主角：他高高地骑在一只披着紫色象服的大象上，戴着贵重头巾的棕色皮肤的男人两边相随；突然他又看见丛林里跳出一只龇牙咧嘴的老虎，伸着前爪去抓大象的鼻子。现在男爵又讲起更为有趣的、关于怎样智捕大象的故事：用驯服的衰老动物把猛烈的、目空一切的幼象诱进木笼子里。孩子的眼睛迸发出炽热的光芒。这时妈妈看了一下表，突然说：“Neuf heures！Au lit！”[10]他觉得，这仿佛在他面前落下一把闪着寒光的刀。

埃德加吃了一惊，脸都吓白了。“带你上床！”这对所有孩子来说，都是一句可怕的话，因为他们觉得，这句话是在大人面前对他们的公然轻蔑，是一种自我招供，是童年和小孩需要多睡眠的一种标志。可是这种羞辱竟发生在这么有意思的时刻，使他听不到这些闻所未闻的故事，这真是太可怕了。

“只听完这一个，妈妈，这个捕象的故事，就让我听完这一个吧！”

他开始乞求了，但立即想起了他作为大人的新的尊严。而他母亲今天也严厉得出奇。“不行，已经很晚了，快上楼吧！Sois sage[11]，埃德加！男爵先生讲的故事明天我都详细地讲给你听。”

埃德加迟疑地站了起来，以前每次都是他母亲送他上床，可今天当着他朋友的面他不愿乞求，他那孩子气的骄傲使他起码还要做出自愿走开的样子。

“真的呀，妈妈，明天你全部讲给我听。全部！关于捕象的故事和其他的故事！”

“好，我的孩子！”

“马上，今天就要讲！”

“好，好，但是你现在去睡。走吧！”

埃德加自己也感到奇怪，他把手递给男爵和妈妈的时候，居然脸没有红，虽然喉咙里已经在呜咽了。男爵亲切地捋了捋孩子那浓密的头发，这使得孩子绷紧的脸上又露出了一丝笑容。接着他就赶快往门口跑去，否则他们就要看到大滴大滴的眼泪从他脸上滚下来了。

大象

母亲和男爵又在桌旁坐了一会儿，但是他们不再谈象和打猎的事了。孩子离开他们之后，他们的谈话气氛有一点压抑，有一点微妙的不安的困窘。后来他们来到前厅，坐在一个角落里。男爵比任何时候都更加神采飞扬，而几杯香槟酒又使她兴味盎然，所以谈话很快就具有了危险性质。本来男爵谈不上漂亮，他只是因为年轻，头发剪得短短的，一张棕黑色的精力旺盛的娃娃脸，很有点男子气魄，他那灵活而几乎是调皮的动作撩得她意马心猿。现在她乐于从近处看他，也不害怕他的目光了。在他谈话之中，逐渐有了一种使她略感困惑的放肆，有某种类似抚摸她的身体的东西，有一种触及她的身体又迅速移开的东西，有某种捉摸不定的欲望，这使得她双颊绯红。随后他又轻快地笑着，无拘无束，像个孩子。这就使得这些细微、轻浮的欲念，好像是孩子闹着玩似的。有时她觉得该对他说句严厉的话。但是她生性喜欢卖弄风情，被这些淫猥的话儿撩拨得心痒难当，只想更多地消受。这种放肆的游戏使她感到销魂。后来她自己也模仿起来。她频送秋波，暗示允诺，完全沉湎在这绵绵情话和狎昵动作中，甚至容许他挨近。他的声音有时使她感觉到他那热乎乎的、战栗的呼吸正喷在她的肩头上。像一切赌徒一样，他们也忘掉了时间，完全陶醉在销魂的谈话之中。到了午夜，前厅里开始熄灯的时候，他们才猛然一惊。

一惊之下，她立即一跃而起，猛然感到自己太放肆了，竟干出了这样的事。本来她也是个玩火的里手，但现在她那已被撩拨起来的本能业已感觉到，火已玩到这个危险的人身边了。她战栗地发现，自己已不能再把握住自己，心里有什么东西开始在蠕动，看什么都很兴奋，宛如一个人在发高烧时的感觉一样。恐惧、酒和火热的话语在她头脑里回旋激荡，一种恼人的、莫名的恐惧攫住了她，她一生中这种恐惧在类似这样的危险时刻里曾经历过数次，但是都没有这一次那样令人头晕目眩，如此猛烈无情。“晚安，晚安。明早再见！”她急匆匆地说着，想逃遁而去。这倒不是为了逃脱，而是为了逃开此刻的危险，逃脱她自己心中一种新奇的、陌生的、欲推犹就的窘境。男爵轻轻抓住她告别时伸出来的手，吻着。不是通常的吻一次，而是用嘴唇从纤秀的手指尖一直到手腕，颤抖着吻了四五次。她感到他硬硬的胡须在她手背上戳得痒痒的，她起了一阵微微的哆嗦。某种温暖的、令人窒息的感情，从手背上随着血液流贯全身。恐惧甜蜜地袭来，她的太阳穴嘣嘣直跳，头在发热。恐惧，这莫名的恐惧现在使得她全身战栗起来，她急忙从他手里抽回了自己的手。

“您再待会儿嘛。”男爵悄悄地说。可是她已经仓皇失措地匆匆跑走了，这个动作使她的恐惧和慌乱暴露得一目了然。现在她心里很兴奋，这也正是男爵的意图。她觉得，她的感情越来越不能解释了。残酷得灼人的恐惧在追逐着她，把她抓住，但就在逃开的时候，她同时又为他没有这样做而感到惋惜。她多年来下意识渴望的事情，很可能会在这种时刻发生。从前这种艳事她总是在最后关头把它摆脱开了，可对它的气息她爱得如痴如醉，这种巨大的、危险的艳事，这种不是转瞬即逝的撩人的调情。可是男爵很骄傲，不去捕捉这个良机。他对自己的胜利满有把握，因而不想在这个女人酒意朦胧、不能自持的时候把她弄到手，正相反，只有神志清醒时的斗争和委身，才会激起这个手段光明正大的赌棍的兴趣。她是逃不出他的手心的。他看到，她血管里火辣辣的毒药使她战栗了。

她在楼梯上停住脚步，用手按着气喘吁吁的心口。她得休息一分钟。她的神经已经受不住了。她从胸口发出一声叹息，这叹息，半是庆幸自己脱离了危险，半是惋惜；这一切都像一团乱麻，弄得人头晕目眩，六神无主。她半闭双眼，像喝醉了酒一样，在往她的房门那儿摸索，接着她深深地舒了一口气，因为她终于抓住了冰凉的门把手。这时她才感到安全了！

她轻轻推门进了房里，马上就吓得退了回来。房里，在里边暗处，有什么东西动了一下。她那兴奋的神经剧烈地战栗了。她正想呼救的当儿，从里面发出了一个轻轻的、睡意蒙眬的声音：“是你吗，妈妈？”

“上帝保佑，你在这里干吗？”说着她就直奔沙发床。埃德加正蜷缩成一团在上面躺着，刚刚醒来。她第一个念头就认为这孩子准是病了，或者是需要什么东西。

但是埃德加却仍带着睡意，用略带一点责备的口气说：“我等你好久，后来就睡着了。”

“干吗等我？”

“为了大象。”

“什么大象？”

现在她才想起，她确实答应今天晚上就把打猎的故事和其他冒险故事全讲给他听的。因此孩子跑到她房间里来了。这单纯、幼稚的孩子，他深信不疑地等着她，等着等着，就睡着了。这种放肆的举动激怒了她，或许她本来是对自己发火，她想大喊大叫来掩饰自己的罪过和羞愧。“马上回自己床上去，你这没有教养的东西！”她对他嚷了起来。埃德加诧异地望着她。她为什么对他发那么大的火？他又没有做什么错事。但是他的惊讶却似火上加油。“马上到自己房里去！”她怒气冲冲地吼道，这时，她感到委屈他了。埃德加默默地走了。原来他已经疲倦极了，透过蒙眬的睡意，他迟钝地感觉到，他母亲没有遵守自己的诺言，这样对待他是不公正的。但是他没有反抗。因为困倦，他觉得什么都是昏昏沉沉的，一切都是麻木迟钝的，随后他又生自己的气，竟在这里睡着了，没有醒着等妈妈。“完全像个孩子。”在重新入睡以前，他还在生自己的气。

因为从昨天起，他就恨自己的童年了。

前哨战

男爵没有睡好。一次调情中断之后就去睡觉总是危险的：一个不平静的、梦魇频扰之夜，使他不久就后悔没有把这一分钟紧紧抓住。当他早晨带着未消的睡意，怀着恶劣的心绪走下楼来时，孩子从躲藏的地方朝他蹦跳过来，热情地投入他的怀里，用千百个问题来折磨他。埃德加非常快乐，他又有一分钟可以独占他的大朋友，而不须和妈妈分享了。他的故事该只讲给他听，不再讲给妈妈听了。他向他提出许许多多问题，因为妈妈虽然答应给他讲，但还是没有把这种奇妙的故事讲给他听。这时，男爵吃了一惊，掩饰不住自己恶劣的心情，但埃德加却把成百个孩子气的、恼人的问题倾倒在他身上。此外，在提这些问题时还掺杂着种种亲昵的表示。他终于又和这位他找了好久、一大早就等着的朋友单独在一起，他真是快乐极了。

男爵粗声粗气地敷衍着。这孩子没完没了的盯梢、数不尽的幼稚的问题以及他那并不讨人喜欢的热情，所有这一切，都开始使他感到厌烦。天天同一个十二岁的孩子转来转去，跟他说些无聊的话，对此他感到厌烦了。现在他一心只想着如何趁热打铁，赶快把这位母亲掌握住，而孩子在场却使这事很棘手。由于他的不慎，唤起了孩子对自己的这种痴情，他对此开始感到不快。这使他心情抑郁，因为暂时他无法摆脱开这个热情得过分的朋友。

不过，无论如何总得设法摆脱他。一直到十点钟——他和孩子母亲约好去散步的时间，他心不在焉地敷衍着叽叽喳喳说个不停的孩子，只是偶尔插上一两句话，同时还翻阅着报纸。可当时钟的指针快成九十度角的时候，仿佛他忽然记起来似的，他请埃德加为他到另一家旅馆去一趟，问问他的表兄格伦特海姆伯爵到了没有。

真心实意的孩子真是高兴极了，终于可以为他的朋友办点事了，他对自己的使者身份很自豪，立即奔了出去，撒腿猛跑，惹得人们都奇怪地望着他的背影。可是他却一心想显示一下，把事情交给他办是多么可靠。那家旅馆的人对他说，伯爵还没有到，现在压根儿还没有人来打过招呼。他带着这个消息又狂奔了回来。但是男爵已经不在前厅里了。于是他就去敲男爵的房门——白敲了一阵！他怀着不安的心情跑遍了所有的场所，音乐室和咖啡室，然后激动地冲到他妈妈那里去打听个究竟。她也不在。最后他十分失望地去问门房，门房告诉他，几分钟之前他们俩人一起出去了！这消息惊得他目瞪口呆。

埃德加耐心地等待着，他天真无邪，根本不往任何坏事上想。他想他们大概只是出去一会儿，对此他是很有把握的，因为男爵还等着他的回话呢。但是好几个小时过去了，不安开始潜入他的心头。真的，打从这位陌生的、诱人的人进入了他幼小的天真无邪的生活那一天起，这孩子整天都处于紧张、激动和纷乱的状态之中。任何热情压在像小孩那么纤细的机体上，宛如压在柔软的石蜡上一样，都会留下它的痕迹。眼皮又神经质地颤抖起来，脸色变得更加苍白。埃德加等啊，等啊，起先是不耐烦，后来就激动不安，末了几乎要哭了。但他一直没有什么怨恨，他盲目地信赖这位出色的朋友。他想可能是个误会。隐隐的恐惧折磨着他，也许是自己把他托付的事理解错了。

他们终于回来了，两人愉快地聊着天，丝毫也没有什么惊讶的表示，这可真令人奇怪极了。看来他们根本就没有把他放在心上。“我们迎你去了，希望在路上碰见你。埃狄[12]。”男爵说，并不问托付他办的事。他们居然没有在路上碰见他，这使孩子大为诧异。他向他们保证说他是从笔直的大马路上跑回来的，并想知道他们是从哪个方向去找他的。刚说到这里，妈妈就打断他的话：“行了，行了！小孩子不要盘根问底，没完没了。”

埃德加脸都气红了，当着他的朋友的面这么卑鄙地来贬低他，这已经是第二次了。她为什么要这样做？他确信，他已不是孩子了，而她为什么总要把他当成孩子？显然她嫉妒他有个朋友，挖空心思想把他的朋友拉过去。对了，刚才肯定是她故意把男爵领错路的。但是他不愿任她欺侮，这一点她该明白。他要给她点颜色看。埃德加决定今天吃饭的时候只同他的朋友说话，跟她一句话也不说。

但是他们根本就没有注意到他的报复，甚至连他这个人也好像没有看见。这使他很难受，这完全出乎他的预料啊！昨天他们在一起的时候，他曾经是轴心啊！现在他们两人谈笑风生，互相调侃，可是没有一句话与他相干，仿佛他掉到桌子底下去了。血涌上他的双颊，喉咙里像是塞了一团东西，卡住了呼吸。他越来越愤慨地意识到自己竟是那样的无足轻重。难道他就老老实实在这儿坐着，看着他母亲把他的朋友抢去，除了沉默之外不能进行什么反抗了吗？他想，他得站起来，用两个拳头出其不意地猛捶桌子。只有这样，才能把他们的注意力引到自己身上。但是他控制住了自己，只是放下刀叉，一口也不吃了。他们很久也没发现他不吃东西，只是到最后一道菜时，母亲才奇怪地注意到，问他是不是不舒服了。“可恶，”他心里想，“她想的只是我是不是病了，别的事情她都觉得无关紧要。”他冷冷地回答说，他不想吃，这她也就满意了。没有什么事，什么事也不会促使他们来理睬他的。男爵似乎已经完全把他忘了，至少他没有和他说过一句话。他眼里热乎乎的，泪水涌进了眼眶，他得想个法子，在乘人不注意的时候，迅速地拿起餐巾，好使这该死的幼稚的泪水不至于毫无顾忌地流下双颊。这顿饭结束的时候，他舒了一口气。

吃饭的时候，他母亲建议一起坐马车到玛丽娅·舒茨去玩一次。埃德加听着，用牙齿咬着嘴唇。她一分钟也不让他单独跟他的朋友在一起。现在她边站起来边对他说：“埃德加，你要把功课全忘了，你得留在房里把功课补一补。”听到这话，他对她恨到了极点。他又一次把小拳头攥得紧紧的。她老想在他朋友面前侮辱他，总是当众提醒他，他还是孩子，还得上学，只有得到允许才可以同大人在一起。这回的用意可是一目了然的。他未做回答，立即把身子扭了过去。“噢，又不高兴了。”她笑着说，随后就对男爵说：“要是他做上一小时功课，真会那么影响他的健康吗？”

“喏，一两小时对身体绝不会有什么坏处。”男爵说。男爵，他一度把自己称为他的好朋友的男爵，曾经嘲笑他是书呆子的男爵，现在居然说这样的话，他感到浑身发凉，血液凝固。

这是默契吗？他们两人真的联合起来对付他了吗？孩子的目光里闪烁着愤怒的火焰。“爸爸不让我在这里学习，爸爸要我在这里休养。”他一下把这句话甩了出来，带有一种对自己疾病的骄傲，绝望地死抱住父亲的话、父亲的威望不放。他把这句话当作是一种威胁说了出来。真是奇怪之至，看来这句话当真使得他们两人心里都不愉快。母亲把目光移开，只用手指烦躁不安地敲着桌子。他们之间出现一阵难堪的沉默。“随你吧，埃狄。”末了男爵强作笑容地说，“我又不用考试，我各门功课早就是不及格的。”

对这个玩笑，埃德加并没有笑，只是用审视的、锐利的目光打量着他，仿佛要深入到他的灵魂中去似的。发生了什么事呢？他们之间的关系起了变化。为什么？孩子并不清楚。他不安地移动着他的目光，一把小槌在他心里剧烈地敲打着：第一次猜疑。

灼人的秘密

“她怎么变得这样？”在滚动着的马车上孩子坐在他们对面沉思起来。为什么他们不像以前那样关心我了？为什么当我注视妈妈的时候，她总是避开我的目光？为什么他老是在我面前开玩笑，装疯卖傻？他们两人不再像昨天和前天那样跟我说话了，我仿佛觉得他们已经换了一副面孔。妈妈今天的嘴唇那么红，她准擦了口红。我从来没有见她这么打扮过。而他呢，老是蹙着眉头，好像我侮辱了他似的。我确实没有做过对不起他们的事啊，没说过一句让他们生气的话呀！不，不会是因为我的缘故，因为他们两人之间的关系和在这之前不一样了。他们两人好像干了什么事而又不敢说出来似的。他们不再像昨天那样谈笑风生、兴致勃勃了。他们很拘束、发窘，他们一定瞒着什么事。他们两人之间准有个什么秘密，不想让我知道。可我无论如何要把这个秘密弄个水落石出，不惜任何代价。我看出来了，就是那种不让我知道的秘密，这种秘密就是演戏时男人和女人伸开胳膊唱歌、互相拥抱又推开的那种秘密。这一定是同我的法语女教师的秘密一样的，爸爸同她相处得很不好，后来就把她辞掉了。所有这些事情都有关联，这我感觉到了，可就是不知道是怎么回事。噢，一定要知道这个秘密，彻底知道这个秘密，要抓住这把钥匙，抓住这把能打开所有大门的钥匙，那我就不再是孩子，不让他们再来搪塞和欺骗我了！不只现在，就是永远也不让人搪塞和欺骗！他们总把什么事都对孩子隐瞒起来。我要揭穿他们的这件事，揭穿这个可怕的秘密。他的额头上起了一道深深的皱纹，他在严肃地苦思冥想，车厢外的景色他连望都不望。这个瘦弱的十二岁的孩子看起来几乎老了。窗外，四周色彩绚丽，山上的针叶林染着一片明净的绿色，山谷沐浴在暮春的柔和光泽里。他只是不住地盯着坐在他对面马车后座上的两个人，他灼热的目光好似一根钓竿要从他们眼睛深处把这个秘密钓出来似的。再没有什么比一条模糊不清的踪迹更能使未成熟的智力大显身手的了，有时候只有一扇很薄的门，就把孩子同我们称之为现实的世界隔开，而凑巧一阵风却会把这扇门给孩子们吹开。

埃德加蓦地感到他从来没有像现在这样挨近这个未知的巨大秘密，好像可以抓得着似的，他觉得这个秘密就在面前，虽然现在还是锁着的，谜底尚未揭开，但是很近，非常之近了。这种感觉鼓舞着他，使他显出突然郑重其事的严肃神情。因为他下意识地感到自己已经处在童年时代的边沿。

对面的两个人心里感到某种隐隐约约的障碍，但并没想到这障碍是来自孩子。三人同车使他俩感到处处受碍，很不自在，他们对面那双森然闪着火焰的眼睛打扰着他们。他们几乎不敢说，也不敢看。现在他们之间再也无法回到以前那种轻松的、社交场合的谈话了，而是很深地陷入语调亲昵、用词挑逗的阶段，常为轻佻的、偷偷的触摸而颤抖不已。他们的谈话常常接不下去。谈话中断了，想继续下去，但又不断地在孩子执拗的沉默影响下绊跤子。

他那固执的缄口不语，特别对于母亲来说是一大负担。她从侧面小心翼翼地打量着他，当她第一次突然发现这孩子咬着嘴唇的神情和她丈夫激怒或生气时的神情完全一样时，她大吃一惊。恰恰是现在，她有外遇时，想起她丈夫来，心里很不是滋味。她觉得，这孩子像是鬼怪，像是良心的卫士，在这马车里的一点点地方，在她对面只有十英寸的距离，滴溜溜滚动着的黑黝黝的眼睛在苍白的额下窥视着。这使她加倍地忍受不了。埃德加忽然抬头凝视有一秒钟之久。两人立即垂下了目光：他们感到生平第一次受到了窥伺。在此之前，母子两人亲密无间，但是现在两人之间，她和他之间，忽然有了什么东西，关系完全变了样。生平第一次，他们开始察觉到，他们两人的命运彼此分开了，两人已经相互暗暗地仇恨起来了，由于这种仇恨还刚产生，彼此都不敢承认。

当马匹又在旅馆前面停下的时候，三个人都舒了口气。这是一次不愉快的远游，这一点大家都感觉到了，可是谁都不敢说。埃德加第一个跳下马车。她母亲告罪说头痛，急忙上楼去了。她极为疲倦，想独自一人待会儿。埃德加和男爵留了下来。男爵给马车夫付了钱，看了看表，径往前厅走去，毫不理睬孩子。孩子望着男爵那优雅、修长的背影，正迈着有节奏的、轻快飘逸的步履。这步履曾经使这孩子着迷，昨天他还悄悄对着镜子模仿哩。他走了，径直走了。显然他把这孩子忘了，让他在马车夫旁边，在马旁边站着，仿佛这孩子与他毫不相干。

埃德加看着他这样走掉，心里像有什么东西被撕成了两片。他，不管怎么他还始终狂热地爱着男爵。男爵就这样走开了，没有用大衣触他一下，没有向他这个知道自己确实毫无过错的孩子说一句话，他心里绝望了。费尽气力保持的镇静崩溃了，人为地加重了尊严的担子从他过于狭窄的肩头滑了下来，他又成了一个孩子，和昨天及以前一样渺小、恭顺。这违反他的本愿，催促他快步向前，他迈着哆嗦的步子，迅速跟着男爵，在男爵正要上楼梯的时候，他在前面拦住了他，带着难以忍住的眼泪，压低了声音说：

“我做了什么对不起您的事？您不理我了！为什么您现在老是对我那么疏远？为什么您总想把我支开？是您觉得我碍事，还是我做错了什么事？”

男爵吃了一惊。这声音里有一种东西扰乱了他的方寸，使他的情绪缓和下来。他对这个毫无恶意的孩子产生了同情心。“埃狄，你是个傻瓜！我只是今天情绪不好。你是个可爱的孩子，我真的很喜欢你。”说着他使劲地来回抚弄着他的头发，但却只是半转过脸来，以免看到孩子这双湿润的、恳求的大眼睛。他演的这出喜剧开始使他有点痛心。本来他对自己如此厚颜无耻地玩弄这个孩子的爱已经感到羞愧了，而这软弱无力的、颤动的、如泣如诉的声音更使他感到痛苦。“现在上楼去吧，埃狄，今天晚上我们又会处得很好的，你看吧！”他抚慰地说。

“但您别让我妈妈早早叫我上楼，好吗？”

“行，行，埃狄，我不让她叫你上楼。”男爵笑着说，“现在上楼去吧，我得去换吃晚餐的衣服。”

埃德加走了，此刻感到十分高兴。但不久心里的槌子又开始敲动起来。昨天以来他好像大了好几岁，猜疑，这位不速之客业已牢牢地盘踞在他的心里了。

他等待着。这是关键性的考验。他们一起围桌而坐。九点钟了，母亲还没叫他去睡觉。他已经感到有些不安了。为什么恰恰今天她让他在这里待那么长时间，而以往她是一到时间就打发他走的呀？难道男爵把他的愿望和谈话告诉给她了？突然间他感到难以名状的后悔，今天真不该以完全信赖的心情去追他啊。到十点钟他母亲忽然站了起来，同男爵告别。奇怪的是，男爵对她过早告辞看来一点也没有感到惊奇，也没有像往常那样挽留她。孩子心里的槌子敲得越来越厉害了。

这是个尖锐的考验，他也装出一无所知的样子，二话没说就跟他母亲朝门口走去。但是走到那里时他突然用眼睛一扫，真的，在这瞬间他截获了一道含笑的目光，它越过他的头顶从她眼里正巧朝男爵送去，这是一道默契的目光，某种秘密的目光。这么说男爵把他出卖了，因此今天的早走是为了要他安静下来，好让他明天不再妨碍他们。

“坏蛋！”他咕哝了一句。

“你说什么？”母亲问道。

“没什么。”他从牙缝里迸出这几个字。现在他有了自己的秘密，它的名字叫作恨，对他们两人无边无际的恨。

沉默

埃德加内心的骚动业已过去。他终于享有了一种纯粹的、明净的感情：仇恨和公开的敌视。他现在确信自己是他俩的障碍。因此跟他俩待在一起就成了他的一种复杂得出奇的乐趣。他觉得破坏他们，用他积聚起来的全副力量去反对他们，是一件赏心悦目的快事。他先是对男爵表露出他的愠怒。早上男爵下楼遇见他时，亲切地向他打招呼说：“早晨好，埃狄。”埃德加坐在靠背椅上纹丝不动，连眼睛都没抬一下，只是咕哝一下，生硬地回了他一句：“好。”“妈妈下来了吗？”埃德加两眼看着报纸说：“我不知道。”

男爵感到惊愕。这一下子怎么啦？“埃狄，怎么啦？没睡好觉？”他本想像往常那样开个玩笑来缓和一下空气，可是埃德加依然轻蔑地冲口回了一个“不”字，随即又埋头看他的报纸。“蠢孩子。”男爵自言自语地喃喃说，耸耸肩膀，走开了，敌意已经公开了。

埃德加也以冷漠和彬彬有礼的态度对待他妈妈。一次她想打发他去网球场玩，对这样一个拙劣的企图，他平静地拒绝了。由于愤恨而轻轻滑动的冷笑紧贴在他的嘴唇上闪现出来，这表明他不再受骗了。“我宁愿跟你们一块去散步，妈妈。”他说这话带着一种虚假的亲热，并紧紧盯住她的两只眼睛。对她说来，这个回答显然是不受欢迎的。她迟疑了片刻，像是寻找什么东西似的。终于她打定了主意，说：“在这儿等我。”于是就去用早点。

埃德加等待着。不信任感在他脑子里折腾着，忐忑不安地直感到他们的每句话里都能搜寻出一种秘密的、敌视的意图。现在这种猜疑经常能使他做出一种具有奇异洞察力的决断。妈妈要他在前厅里等，但他不在那里等，而宁愿站在马路上，那里不只能监视大门，而且能监视所有的门道。他心里有某种预感，觉得妈妈耍了个骗局。这下他俩可再也溜不掉了。像在讲印第安人故事的书里学到的那样，他躲在马路旁的一堆木料后面。大约半个小时之后，他看到他妈妈真的从一个侧门出来了，手里拿着一束绚丽的玫瑰花，后面跟着男爵，那个叛徒。这时他满意地笑了。

两个人兴高采烈。他俩避开了他，光是为了自己的秘密，就可以舒口气了吗？他俩谈笑风生，正准备折向通往林中的小径。

现在是时候了，埃德加不慌不忙地，做得像是偶然到这里来似的，从木料后面踱了出来。他非常镇定地向他俩走来，以便有时间，有许多时间来充分欣赏他俩的惊诧表情。两个人一怔，交换一下惊奇的眼光。这孩子慢慢地，带着一种泰然的神情向他们走去，他那嘲弄的目光紧盯着他们。“啊，你在这儿，埃狄，我们在里面找过你了。”母亲终于开口说。“她撒谎撒得多不要脸啊！”孩子心里想，但是他的嘴唇却一动不动，把仇恨的秘密掩藏在牙齿的后面。

三个人犹豫不决地站在那儿，一个窥伺着另一个。“那我们走吧。”这个恼火的女人沮丧地说，顺手撕碎了一朵最鲜艳的玫瑰花。她的鼻翼在轻轻地翕动，这就暴露了她的愠怒。埃德加站在那里，仿佛这与他毫无关系，他望着蓝天，等待着。他俩要走的时候，他准备跟随他们，男爵又做了一次努力。他说：“今天有网球联赛，你看过没有？”埃德加轻蔑地望了他一眼，对他根本就不予理睬，只是翘翘嘴唇，像是要吹口哨似的。这就是他的答复，明亮的牙齿显示了他的仇恨。

孩子突如其来的出现，像梦魇似的纠缠着两个人。罪犯跟在看守后面走着，暗暗攥紧了拳头。其实孩子并没有做什么，可是他俩却每分钟都无法忍受他那窥视的目光。孩子的眼睛里噙着愤怒的泪水，含着深深的阴郁，它对任何接近的尝试都愤怒地加以摈斥。“离远一点！”突然母亲狂怒地说道。孩子不断地偷听他们的谈话使她烦躁不安。“别老在我跟前跳来跳去，把人烦死了！”埃德加顺从地走开了，但是每走一两步就回过头来，一看到他俩落在后面，他就停在那儿等待着，像条黑狗用他那靡非斯特的目光[13]，纵横上下地织成一个仇恨的火网。他俩感到已被火网套住，无法脱身。

孩子恶狠狠的沉默像一种强酸腐蚀了他俩的兴致，他的目光使他们的谈话一到唇边就变得索然无味。男爵再也不敢说一句挑逗的话了，他愤怒地感觉到这个女人要从手上滑掉，她那好不容易才点燃的热情由于害怕这个令人厌恶的孩子又冷淡下来了。他俩总想设法交谈，却总是谈不下去。末了他们三人都默不作声，无精打采地走着，只听到树木摇曳碰撞发出的低语和他们自己扫兴的脚步声。这孩子把他俩的谈话窒息了。

现在三个人心里都充满了一触即发的敌意。这个被出卖的孩子快乐地感到，他们的愤怒完全抵御不住他的被蔑视的存在，但他却咬牙含恨地等着他们发作。他不时用狡黠的嘲弄的目光打量着男爵那气冲冲的面孔。他看到在男爵牙缝中滚动着骂人的话，而又不得不抑制自己，以免骂出口来。他同时也怀着一种魔鬼般的乐趣注意到他母亲的怒火正在呼呼上升；他看出他俩在寻找机会，向他扑过来，把他推倒，或者使他不能再妨碍他们。但是他不给他们这样的机会，他对自己的仇恨做了长时间的筹划，使它没有任何破绽可寻，没有任何漏洞可钻。

“我们回去吧！”他母亲突然说道。她觉得无法再控制自己了，她准会做出什么事来，至少会在这种刑罚下喊叫起来。“多可惜，”埃德加平静地说，“这儿多美啊。”

他俩知道孩子在嘲弄他们。但是他俩什么也不敢说。这暴君在两天之内如此出色地学会了控制自己，不动声色，毫不泄露这是恶意的揶揄。他们一声不响地在漫长的路上往回走。当房间里只剩下母亲和孩子两人时，她仍然激怒不已。她悻悻地把阳伞和手套掷在一旁。埃德加立刻注意到她的神经在激动，火气需要发泄，但是他希望这次爆发，因此故意留在房间里，以便激怒她。她来回走动，又坐了下来，用手指敲弹着桌子，随后又跳了起来。“看你的头发乱成什么样子！你脏得太不像话了，这样子见人简直是丢脸。这么大了你不知道羞耻？”孩子一句顶撞的话也没说，走到一边去梳头。这种沉默，这固执而冷漠的沉默以及跳动在嘴唇上的嘲弄简直把她气得发狂，她真想狠狠地揍他一顿。“回自己房里去！”她冲着他叫了起来。埃德加微微一笑，随即走了出去。

现在她和男爵，他们两人见到孩子就发抖，在每次会面的时间，对孩子那无情而冷酷的目光都感到恐惧！他俩越是感到不自在，孩子的眼睛里就越是焕发出欢愉的光泽，他的喜悦就越有一种挑衅的味道。埃德加现在几乎在用孩子们野兽般的残忍来折磨这对毫无抵御能力的人。男爵倒还能够压住他的怒火，因为他一直希望这是孩子的恶作剧，他只想着自己的目的。可是她，这个做妈妈的却一再控制不了自己。她觉得冲他大喊大叫一通自己会感到轻松些。“别玩弄叉子！”在餐桌上她冲着他喊叫起来，“你是个没教养的丑八怪，你还不配和大人坐在一起。”埃德加仅是微微一笑，把头稍微歪向一边。他知道这喊叫意味着绝望。看到她如此不加掩饰，他感到骄傲。他现在的目光非常镇定，镇定得像医生的目光。前段时间，为了惹他们生气，或许他是恶狠狠的，但人们在仇恨中学得很多、很快，现在他只是沉默！沉默！沉默！直到她在他沉默的压力下开始长吁短叹。

他母亲再也无法忍受了。现在当他们吃完饭站了起来，埃德加又以这种不言自明的神态准备尾随他们时，她一下子就发作了。她一切都不顾了，吐出了真话。她被他不时的窥视弄得坐卧不安，像一匹被牛虻折磨的马一样暴跳了起来。“你像三岁孩子那样老是跟着我转悠干什么？我不要你老待在我跟前。孩子不要老缠着大人。记住！自己一个人去待一小时。看看书，或者随便干点什么。让我安静安静！你老在我身边溜来溜去，那副讨厌的样子，真让人烦死了。”

终于把她的供词逼出来了！男爵和她这时显得十分尴尬，而埃德加却莞尔一笑。她转过身想走了。她对自己感到生气，刚才怎么好对孩子泄露自己不愉快的心情呢？但是埃德加只是冷冷地说：“爸爸不让我一个人在这儿转来转去。我已经答应爸爸了，在这儿处处小心，要跟在您身边。”

他强调“爸爸”两个字，因为他早就注意到这两个字对他们两人有着某种使他们瘫痪的神秘作用。他父亲同这种炽热的秘密也准有某种瓜葛。爸爸一定具有某种支配他俩的隐秘的、他不知道的力量。因为一提到爸爸，好像就会使他俩感到恐惧和不快，就是这次，他们也未作反抗。他们放下了武器。母亲先走了，男爵也随后离去。在他俩之后是埃德加，但他不像仆人那样畏葸，而像一名看守那样强硬、严峻和无情。他抖动着无形的锁住他俩的铁链，他们摇晃着，但无法挣脱掉。仇恨锻炼了他那孩子式的力量。他，一个无知的人，却远比那两个被秘密铐住双手的人更为强大。

撒谎者

时间很紧迫。男爵只剩下很少几天可供利用了。他俩感到，去反抗这惹火了的孩子的执拗劲是没有用的，于是他俩只好采取最后的、也是最卑劣的一招：逃。摆脱开他的专横统治，哪怕是一两个钟头也好。

“把这封信送到邮局去寄挂号。”母亲对埃德加说。母子俩人站在前厅里，男爵在外边正和一驾出租马车的车夫谈话。埃德加狐疑地拿着这封信。他想起来，过去都是有个仆役给母亲跑腿的。他们是不是在合谋算计他呢？

他犹豫不决。

“你在哪儿等我？”

“在这里。”

“一定？”

“是的。”

“你可不要走开呀！你在前厅这儿一直等到我回来？”

由于他感到自己占了上风，所以同母亲说话时带着命令式的口吻。从前天起发生了多大的变化啊！

他拿着两封信走了。在门口他和男爵碰了个照面。埃德加同他搭话了。两天来这是第一次。

“我去发两封信。我妈妈在等着我，等到我回来。你们可不要先走掉啊。”

男爵急忙从旁边挤了过去。“好的，好的，我们等你。”

埃德加向邮局奔去。他得等着。他前面的一位先生提了一大堆无聊的问题。埃德加终于办完了他的事，拿着挂号单跑了回来。回来时正赶上看到他母亲和男爵坐着出租马车走了。

他气得发呆了，几乎想弯腰拾起一块石头向他俩掷去。他俩到底把他摆脱掉了，但是撒了一个多么下流、多么卑鄙的谎啊！他母亲说谎，这他昨天就知道了；但她居然能这样不要脸，说话不算数，这就把他对她的最后一点信任也摧毁了。他看到那些言辞只不过是些色彩缤纷的水泡，它们膨胀起来，一碎就化为乌有，而他从这些言辞后面揣摸到了事实真相。从此，他就不再能理解整个生活了。这会是一个什么可怕的秘密，居然使成年人欺骗他这么一个孩子，像罪犯似的偷偷溜走？在他读过的那些书里，人们为了得到金钱或者为了攫取权力和王国而进行谋杀和欺骗。可这儿却是为了什么？这两个人要干什么？为什么他俩要躲避他？他俩撒了上百个谎究竟想遮掩什么呀？他绞尽脑汁，穷思苦想。他隐约地感觉到，这项秘密就是童年的一把门闩，获得了这项秘密就意味着长成一个大人，长成一个男子汉了。噢，一定得掌握这个秘密！但他没法进一步清晰地去思考。他俩摆脱了他，这事燃起了他的愤怒，给他清澈的目光蒙上一层烟雾。

他跑进树林，恰好来得及躲入暗处，使别人都看不到他。这时他哭了起来，泪如泉涌。“撒谎、狗东西、骗子、流氓！”——他必须大声地把这些话喊出来，否则他会憋死的。愤怒、焦急、恼恨、好奇、一筹莫展和他俩这些天来的背叛都被压制在孩子气的斗争里，被禁锢在他把自己想象成大人的幻觉之中，现在一齐迸出胸膛，化成了泪水。这是他童年时代的最后一次哭泣，最后一次号啕大哭，他最后一次像女人一样，哭一阵就感到痛快些。他在这不能自制的愤怒时刻，把所有一切都一股脑儿哭了出来：信任、热爱、虔诚、尊敬——他的整个童年。

男孩回到旅馆之后，已经变成另一个人了。他十分冷静，办事谨慎而周密。他先回到自己的房间，把脸和眼睛细心地擦洗干净，不让他俩看到他有泪痕，不让他们享受胜利的喜悦。随后他就准备进行清算。他耐心地等候着，毫无不安的感觉。

当马车载着这两个逃亡者返回旅馆时，前厅里有很多的人。有几位先生在下棋，另一些人在看报纸，女人们在闲谈。在这群人中间，孩子一动不动地坐着，他面色显得有些苍白，目光颤抖。现在，他母亲和男爵进门突然看到了他，感到有些尴尬。男爵正要结结巴巴地讲他事先编好的谎话时，孩子挺直身子安详地朝他俩走去，挑衅地说道：“男爵先生，我有话同您谈。”

这使男爵感到不快。他有一种像被抓住了的感觉。“好的，好的。以后再说，以后吧！”

但是埃德加提高了嗓门，声音响亮而严峻，周围的人都听得清：“可是我想现在同您谈。您做得太卑鄙下流了。您骗了我。您是知道的，妈妈在等我，可您……”

“埃德加！”母亲喊了起来，向他扑过去，所有人的目光都朝她望去。

但是孩子现在却突然刺耳地叫了起来，因为他看到她要把他的话压下去：

“我当着大家的面再对您说一遍：你无耻地撒了谎，这是卑鄙的，这是下流的。”

男爵站在那里，面色苍白，人们都望着他，有几个人窃窃地笑了起来。

母亲抓住了激动得发抖的孩子：“马上到你房间里去，要不我就在众人面前揍你一顿。”她声音沙哑、结结巴巴地说道。

但是埃德加站在那里又恢复了平静。刚才这样冲动，他觉得遗憾。他不满意自己，因为本来他是想冷静地向男爵挑战的，只是到最后一刻，愤怒竟比他的意志更为厉害。他安详地从容不迫地向楼梯走去。

“请您原谅，男爵先生，原谅他的粗野。您知道，他是一个神经质的孩子。”她还在结结巴巴地说，周围的人都盯着她，目光里流露出有点幸灾乐祸的神情，这使她惶惑不安。世界上再没有比丑闻更使她感到可怕的了，她知道她必须保持镇定。她不是立刻就溜走，而是先到门房那里问问有没有她的信件以及说几句无关紧要的小事，随后才快步走上楼去，仿佛什么事情都没有发生似的。但是在她身后是一片窃窃私语和压低的笑声。

半路上她放慢了脚步。面对这种严重的处境她一点办法也没有，同时对这场争吵感到恐惧。她无法否认这是自己的过错。还有，她怕孩子的目光，害怕孩子这种新的、陌生和奇怪的目光，这目光使她瘫痪和惶恐不安。由于畏惧，她决定用温柔的办法来试一试。她知道，在这样一场斗争中这个被激怒了的孩子是强者。

她轻轻地拉开门。孩子在那里坐着，平静而冷淡，他望着她，眼里毫无惧色，也没露出任何好奇的神情。他显得泰然自若。

“埃德加，”她尽可能亲昵地开始说，“你怎么啦？我为你感到害臊啊。你怎么这样粗野，还是一个孩子就这样对待大人！你得马上去向男爵先生道歉。”

埃德加望着窗外。这个“不”字，他像是对着树木说的。他那镇定的神情使她感到惊奇、陌生。

“埃德加，你这是怎么啦？你怎么变得和往常大不一样了？我简直都认不出你来了。往日你是个聪明的乖孩子，人们都喜欢你。可你一下子变成这个样子，像是让魔鬼缠住了似的。你为什么那样恨男爵？以前你是非常喜欢他的。他对你一直是那么好啊。”

“是呀，因为他想认识你。”

她感到很不是味儿。“胡说！你想到哪去了。你怎么能这样想呢？”

这下孩子可光火了。

“他是撒谎的人，一个伪君子。他所做的都是为了自己，是卑鄙的。他想要认识你，才对我表示亲热，还答应送给我一只狗。我不知道他答应了你什么，为什么对你那么亲热，但是他也要从你身上得点什么，妈妈，这是肯定的。要不他不会这样客气友好的。他是一个坏人。他撒谎。你只要瞧一瞧他那样子，有多虚伪。啊，我恨他，恨这个卑鄙的骗子，这个流氓……”

“埃德加，你怎么能说这话呢？”她不知所措，也不知该怎么回答。她心里激起了一种感情，觉得孩子是对的。

“真的，他是个流氓，这我是不会看错的。你自己一定也会看出来的。他为什么怕我？他为什么躲避我？因为他知道我看透他了，我认识他，这个流氓！”

“你怎么能说这话呢，你怎么能说这话呢？”她脑海里已经枯竭了，只是用毫无血色的嘴唇结结巴巴地一再重复这两句话。现在她蓦地感到害怕了，但是并不知道是怕男爵呢，还是怕孩子。

埃德加看出他的告诫起了作用。把她拉到自己这一边，成为仇恨男爵、反对男爵的一个同志，这个思想在引诱着他。他温和地走到母亲身边，拥抱她。他的声调由于激动变得像在讨好似的。

“妈妈，”他说，“你一定会自己看出，他不会干什么好事的。他都把你变成另一个人了。不是我，而是你变了。他怂恿你来反对我，只是为了独个跟你好。他肯定会欺骗你的。我不知道他答应给你什么，可我知道他不会遵守诺言。你应当提防他。谁骗了一个人，那他也会骗另一个人。他是一个恶人，你不应该信任他。”

这声音充满感情，几乎是声泪俱下，像是出自她本人的心胸。她心里已经产生了一种不愉快的感觉，这种感觉告诉她的与孩子所说的一样恳切、中肯。但是她不好意思向自己的孩子承认他是对的。她像许多人一样，常用一种粗暴的方式来拯救自己，使自己摆脱由于强烈感情的冲击所造成的狼狈处境。她愠怒地挺了挺身子。

“小孩子懂得什么！这些事不用你来多嘴。你应当有礼貌。就这些。”

埃德加的脸上又泛起一片冷意。“随你好了，”他生硬地说，“反正我警告过你了。”

“那么说你是不准备去道歉了？”

“不。”

他俩面对面站着，满脸怒气。她觉得这关系到她的威望。

“那你就在楼上用餐。一个人。在你没有道歉之前，不准到我们桌上来。我要教你懂得规矩。不得到我的许可，不准你离开房间，听懂了吗？”

埃德加微微一笑。这种不怀好意的微笑，像是与他的嘴唇长在一起的。在内心他却对自己发火。他多愚蠢，竟然又一次泄露了他的衷曲，而且还对她，这个撒谎的女人发出警告呢。

母亲快步走了出去，连一眼也没看他。她惧怕这双犀利的眼睛。自从感觉到孩子已经看出了一切，并告诉她这件她不想知道、也不想听到的事情后，这孩子就使她感到讨厌了。使她感到惊愕的是，她仿佛听到一个声音，她的良知离开了她的躯体，乔装成孩子，乔装成她亲生的孩子在她身旁走来走去，在警告她、嘲弄她。直到现在，这个孩子一直生活在她身边，是一件装饰品，一个玩物，是一种爱和信赖，有时也是一个累赘，但不论是什么，都总是同她生活在同一激流中、合着她生活的节拍。这孩子今天第一次放肆起来，反抗她的意志。现在在她对自己孩子的回忆中，总是夹着某种类似仇恨的东西。

不仅如此，现在当她稍感倦意地走下楼梯时，从她自己的心胸中响起了孩子的声音：“你应当提防他。”——这个警告总是不肯缄默。这时她从一面闪亮的镜子前面走过，她询问般地向里望去，越望越深，越望越深，直到镜子里的嘴唇泛起一丝微笑，并围成圆形，像是要吐出一个危险的字眼似的，从她的内心深处还响着这种声音。但是她高高地耸耸肩膀，犹如要把所有这些看不见的思虑全都抖落下来似的，朝镜子里快乐地看了一眼，扯了扯衣服，带着一个赌棍把最后一枚金币叮当一声抛到赌台上去的那种果断的神态走下楼去。

月光中的踪迹

侍者把晚餐给埃德加送到房间里，随后就锁上了门。门上的锁在他身后嘎嘎地响着。孩子愤怒地跳了起来。很明显，这是受他母亲的指使，把他像一头凶狠的野兽似的关了起来。他心里产生了一个可怕的念头。

“把我关在这里，下面在干什么呢？现在他们两人在商量些什么？如果到头来这个秘密就在那儿，难道我就把它错过？噢，一旦我在大人们中间，我就能到处觉察到这个秘密，在夜里，大人们把门关起来，把这个秘密沉浸在轻言絮语中，要是我能偷偷地进到里面，这巨大的秘密就在面前；几天来我已经接近了它，可就是还一直没有把它抓住！从前，为了捉住它，我什么都干过！那时候我从爸爸的书桌里偷了些书出来，这些奇奇怪怪的事情书里都有，只是我不懂。这个秘密一定贴着个什么封条，要想找到它，得先把封条揭去，这封条也许是在我身上，也许是在别人身上。那时我问过别的女仆，求她把书里这些地方给我讲一讲，但是她把我嘲笑了一顿。做个孩子太可怕了，好奇心重，可是不许问别人，在大人面前总是显得很可笑，好像是些傻瓜和废物似的。但我会把这个秘密弄清楚的，我感到现在很快就会知道了。我已经掌握了一部分，不把它全部弄到手，决不罢休！”

他谛听是否有人来。外面，微风吹拂着树林，把枝条之间静如明镜一样的月光碎成无数摇曳不定的小片。

“他们俩想干的一定不会是什么好事，要不他们干吗要编造那么卑劣的谎言来把我支开。他俩现在肯定在嘲笑我。这两个该诅咒的到底把我甩开了，但是最后笑的是我。我真太蠢了，让人关在这里，而不去紧紧盯住他们，窥视他俩的一举一动，倒反让人关在这里。我知道，大人往往都不怎么谨慎，他俩一定会露出马脚的。他们总认为我们孩子还很小，晚上睡得死死的。可他们忘了，我们也会假装睡觉而去偷听，我们也能装傻，而实际上十分聪明。前不久，我的姑姑生了孩子，其实这事大人早就知道了，可是在我面前却装作惊奇的样子，仿佛感到很意外似的。但是我也是知道的，因为我听他们说过，那是几星期前一个晚上，他们以为我睡着了就谈论起来。这次我也要让他们惊讶一下。这两个卑鄙的家伙。噢，现在他俩一定自以为很保险，我要是能穿门而出，前去侦察，暗地里注视他俩，那该多好。现在我也许该按铃吧？这样女仆就会来开门，问我要什么东西。或者我吆喝骂人，摔碎餐具，那他们也会来开门的。这当儿我就可以溜走，去窃听他俩说话。不行，我不这样做。不能让别人看见他们对待我是如何卑鄙。我以此为骄傲。明天我再向他们算账。”

楼下传来一个女人的笑声。埃德加一怔，这可能是他母亲。她倒是有理由发笑，有理由嘲弄他，一个小孩，一个走投无路的人，要是他让人觉得累赘的话，就把他锁在房间里，像扔团湿衣服一样，往墙角一甩了事。他小心翼翼地把头探出窗外。不是，不是她，是一个他不认识的放肆的姑娘在和一个小伙子逗趣。

就在这时，他看到窗户离地面并不很高。不知不觉他起了一个念头：跳出去，现在他俩肯定自以为很保险，我正好去偷听。这个决定使他兴奋得全身发热，仿佛他已经把这个童年时代闪闪发光的、显得十分巨大的秘密掌握在手里了似的。“跳出去，跳出去！”他颤抖着。毫无危险，没有人从这里走过去。于是他就跳了下去。只有鹅卵石发出轻微的声响，没有一个人听到。

这两天，蹑手蹑脚和窥伺已经成了他生活中的一大乐趣。他轻轻提起脚步绕着旅馆走，小心翼翼地避开灯光的强烈反照。这时他有一种快感，这快感同因恐惧而引起的轻微战栗混在一起。他先是谨慎地把面颊紧贴在餐厅的玻璃上向里张望。他俩常坐的位置上是空的。随后他逐个窥视各扇窗户。他不敢进旅馆去，因为怕在过道中间凑巧碰上他们。到处都找不到他俩。他感到绝望了。正在这时，他看到两个影子从门里闪了出来——他往回一缩，蹲在暗处——他母亲和那个形影不离的伴侣出来了。来得正是时候。他们在谈些什么？他无法了解。他们说得很轻，风在树林里变得不安起来。忽然飘来一阵十分清晰的笑声，这是他母亲的声音。这笑声他从来没有听见过，笑得少有的刺耳，像是被胳肢、被刺激引起的神经质的笑声。他感到这笑声很陌生，心里大为惊愕。她在笑。那就是说没有什么危险的事了，不是什么要对他隐瞒的大事，不是什么了不起的事。埃德加感到有些失望。

但是他们为什么要离开旅馆？现在夜都深了，他们到哪儿去呢？风在高空中挥动着巨大的翅膀，夜空刚才还很洁净，充溢着月光的清辉，现在变得昏暗了，无形的手撒开了黑色的幕布，有时把月亮包裹起来，使夜变得漆黑一团，几乎连路都难以辨认。当月亮重又露出来时，一切又都被洒上光辉。银色的月光冷冷地泻在周围的山川树木上。光和影之间进行着神秘莫测的游戏，像是一个女人，时而赤身裸体，时而裹着衣服在嬉戏，是那样的诱人。正在这时，四周的景物又赤裸裸呈现出明亮的胴体：埃德加从侧面看到路上有两个移动着的黑色身影，或者不如说是一个身影，因为他俩贴得那么紧，仿佛两人心里害怕而紧紧挤在一起似的。可现在他们两个要去哪里？松树在呻吟，林中像是充满了忙碌和喧嚣，宛如在围捕野兽。“我跟着他们，”埃德加想，“风刮得这么紧，林中这样响，他俩不会听到我的脚步声。”在他们沿着下面宽广明亮的大路向前走去时，埃德加在上面的林中轻巧地从一棵树跳向另一棵树，从一个树影跃向另一个树影。他无情地紧紧跟踪他们。他感谢风儿，它使别人听不到他的脚步声；他咒骂风儿，它老是把他们说的话刮到远处。要是他能听到他们的谈话就好了，哪怕是只听到一次，那他肯定就可以知道这个秘密。

下面的两个人信步走去，毫无所知。他俩陶醉在这广阔、昏乱的夜色之中，在不断增长的激动中忘却了自己。没有任何预感来警告他们：上面树叶浓密的暗处有人在跟踪着他们的每一个脚步，有两只眼睛死死地盯着他们，充满了仇恨和好奇。

突然他俩停住了。埃德加也立即停住了脚步，紧紧贴在一棵树上。一种剧烈的恐惧向他袭来。要是他俩现在往回走，比他先回到旅馆，要是他不能及时赶回自己的房间，母亲发现房间是空的，那该怎么办？这样一来一切都完了，他们会知道他暗地里窥视他们来着，他就再没有希望从他们那里索取这个秘密了。但是他们二人犹豫不决，显然在争论什么。幸好有月亮，他一切都看得清清楚楚。男爵指着一条昏黑狭窄的小路，这条小路通往下面的山谷，在那里月亮不像这条路上那样倾泻着它的全部光华，而只是透过密林渗出点滴的光亮和稀疏的光线。“他干吗要到下边去？”埃德加抽搐了一下。他母亲好像说“不”，可是另一个却在说服她。埃德加从他的手势上看得出他是多么紧迫。孩子害怕了。这个人想向他母亲要什么？这个混蛋为什么要把她领到暗处去？突然他从自己所读过的那些书里——这些书就是他的整个世界——生动地记起了谋杀、拐骗和可怕的犯罪。一定的，他想谋杀她，正是为此他才摆脱开他，把她单独引到这里。他该呼救吗？杀人犯！呼救声刚要冲出喉咙，但是嘴角却发干，喊不出声来。他的神经由于激动绷得紧紧的，使他几乎站立不稳。由于害怕跌倒，他赶紧伸手去抓一个把手——这时咔嚓一声，他双手折断了一根树枝。

那两个人惊愕地转过身来，凝望着暗处。埃德加一声不响地靠在树上，胳膊紧紧贴在一起，矮小的身体深深地埋在树影之中。死一样的寂静。但他俩像是受惊了。“我们回去。”他听到他母亲说，声音显得畏葸胆怯。男爵本人显然也不安起来，他顺从了。两人慢慢地往回走，相互靠得紧紧的。他俩内心的惶恐就是埃德加的幸福。他用四肢在林中爬行，双手都被划出血来，到了森林的尽头，他就全速往回跑去，气喘吁吁，到了旅馆，三脚两步就蹦上了楼，锁门的钥匙幸好在门上插着，他开了门，冲进房里，躺到床上。他得休息几分钟，因为心在胸膛里剧烈地跳动着，像是钟舌在敲响的钟壁上那样跳动不已。

随后他胆子大了起来，靠在窗旁，等着他们两人的到来。好长时间过去了。他们一定走得很慢，很慢。他从窗框的暗影里小心地窥视着。现在他们慢慢地走来了，月光照着他们的衣服。在这绿光中他们看起来像幽灵似的。男爵真是杀人凶手吗？他刚才阻止了一件多么可怕的事啊，这个想法使他感到既慰藉又恐怖。他望着他们粉白色的脸，看得清清楚楚。母亲的脸上流露出一种欣喜的表情，这是他从没有见过的，但男爵却显得烦恼和不悦。很明显，这是因为他的意图落空了。

他俩紧紧挨在一起，一直到旅馆门前他俩的身体才互相分开。是不是他们会朝楼上看？没有，他俩谁也没有往上看。“他们把我忘记了。”孩子想。他怀着一股狂暴的怒气，同时又感到一种隐隐的胜利的喜悦，“我可没有忘记你们。你们以为我睡了，或者在这个世界上不存在了，但是你们会看到你们的错误的，我要监视你们的一举一动，直到从他这个混蛋手中把这个秘密弄出来为止。这可怕的秘密，它使我无法入睡。我一定要粉碎你们的同盟。我不睡。”

那两个人慢慢地进了大门。现在当他俩一前一后往里走去时，两个投在地上的黑影又倏地纠缠在一起，变成了一条黑色的长带消逝在光亮的门内。楼前的空地在月光中洁白明亮，像铺满白雪的辽阔草地。

袭击

埃德加喘着粗气从窗户旁退了回来，恐怖在摇撼着他。在他的生活里还从没有这样接近过这样充满神秘莫测的东西。书本中那个激动不安的世界，紧张冒险的世界，充满凶杀和欺骗的世界，他原以为只能在童话中，在梦幻的后面，是不真实的，不可企及的。可现在他就像突然陷进了这个充满恐怖的世界之中，一经同它直接接触，他的整个身心就剧烈地震颤不已。这个男人，这个神秘的人，这个突然闯进她平静生活的男人究竟是谁？他光是一个杀人犯吗？为什么老是找偏僻的地方，要把他母亲拉往暗处？看来是要发生可怕的事了。他不知道该怎么办。明天他要给爸爸写信或发电报，这是肯定的。可是这坏事，这可怕的事，这谜一样的事会不会现在就发生，今天晚上就发生呢？他母亲还没有回到自己的房间，她还同那个可恨的陌生人在一起呢。

在内层门和外层门之间有可以轻易开启的暗门，里面有一个狭窄的空间，比一个衣柜大不了多少。他紧贴着身体挤进这巴掌大的暗处，以便窥视他们的脚步。他决意不让他俩有瞬间的机会单独在一起。现在是午夜时分，过道上空荡荡，只有唯一的一盏灯亮着，光线微弱黯淡。

他感到这几分钟的时间长得可怕——终于，他听到向楼上走来的轻微的脚步声。他全神贯注地谛听着。这不是像要回到自己房间去的那种疾步行走，而是一种拖沓、犹豫、非常缓慢的脚步，像是在攀登一条崎岖难行的陡峭山路似的。这中间老是一再的耳语和走走停停。埃德加激动得浑身发抖。他俩走到头了？怎么他还和她在一起？耳语声听不见，脚步声尽管还是迟疑不决，但越来越近了。现在他突然听到了男爵那可怕的声音，他嘶哑地轻轻地在说什么，可埃德加听不懂，随之是他母亲立即表示异议：“不，今天不！不！”

埃德加在发抖，他俩走近了，他什么都可以听清楚了。他们走向他的每一步，尽管是那么轻，仍使他的心胸感到痛苦。那种声音他感到极为可憎，这该死的家伙的声音里充满了贪婪，是多么令人厌恶！

“您不要这样残忍。您今天晚上多美啊！”

另一个声音说：“不，我不应当，我不能够，您放开我。”

在他母亲的声音里流露出那么多的恐怖，使孩子大吃一惊。他还要她什么呢？为什么害怕呢？他俩越来越近了，大概现在已经到了他的门前。他浑身颤抖，现在他就站在他俩的身后，近在咫尺，只有一层薄布挡着。现在连他们的呼吸声都能听到了。

“您来吧，玛蒂尔德，您来吧！”他又听到母亲的喘气声，声音越来越脆弱，抗拒的力量瘫痪了。

这是怎么了？他俩又走到黑暗中去了。他母亲没有回自己的房间，竟是过门而不入！他要把她拖到哪儿去？她为什么不再说话了？难道他往她嘴里塞了团布？把她的喉咙卡住了？

这个想法使他狂怒了。他用颤抖的手把门开了一半。现在他看到他俩在昏暗的过道上，男爵用胳膊搂着他母亲的腰，领着她轻轻走去，看来她已经不再抗拒了。现在他在自己的房门前停住了。“他要把她弄走？”孩子惊慌起来，“现在他要下手作恶了。”

他猛地冲了出去，把门一关就向二人奔去。当他母亲看到突然有什么东西向她扑来时，她叫了起来，吓瘫了。男爵费了好大的劲才把她扶住。可就在这一刹那，他觉得一个软弱的小拳头打在自己脸上，打得他的嘴唇狠狠地碰在牙齿上，他周身像被猫抓了一样。他把那个受惊的女人放开，她立即疾步逃之夭夭。在他还不知道是谁打他之前，就胡乱地招架，用拳头回击起来。

孩子虽是个弱者，但他毫不屈服。早就渴望的时刻终于来到了，他可以把被出卖的爱，积聚起的仇恨一股脑儿激烈地发泄出来。他用自己的两只小拳头乱捶一气，紧咬嘴唇，怒火中烧，像发了疯一样。男爵现在也认出是他来了，他对这个密探满腔仇恨，几天来这孩子一直在触他的霉头，破坏他的好事，他狠狠地回击，不管打在什么地方。埃德加喘着粗气，但他毫不放松，也不呼救。午夜时分，他俩在过道上默默地、咬牙切齿地搏斗了一分钟之久，男爵才慢慢意识到他同一个尚未发育成熟的孩子打架是多么可笑。他紧紧抓住了他，想把他甩开。孩子这时感到身不由己，知道一会儿就要输了，就将挨打，暴怒中他朝着那只想来卡他脖子的手就咬。被咬的人下意识地发出一声低沉的叫喊，松了手，孩子就利用这一瞬间逃回自己的房里，把门闩上。

这场午夜的战斗只持续了一分钟。周围没有任何人听到。一切都寂静无声，仿佛都在沉睡。男爵用手帕擦了擦流血的手，不安地窥视着昏暗的四周。没有人窃听，只有顶棚上一盏电灯在不安地闪烁，他觉得这盏灯也在嘲弄他。

暴风雨

第二天早晨，当埃德加蓬松着头发从昏乱的恐惧中醒过来时，他自问道：“难道这是梦，是一个凶恶的、危险的梦吗？”他的脑袋在嗡嗡作响，关节发木僵硬。现在，他往下一看，才发现自己还穿着衣服。他一跃而起，蹒跚到镜前，一望自己苍白、扭曲的面孔就惊得后退。他的额角上有一条红肿的血痕。他费力地集中思想，恐惧地回忆起一切：夜里过道上的那场战斗。他冲回房间，像发烧似的颤抖着，往床上一倒，还是穿着衣服，以便随时可以逃出去。他在那儿一觉睡了过去，沉入郁闷的、布满阴云的睡乡，那一切又在梦里再现了一次，所不同的只是更为可怕，还带有一股流着鲜血的潮湿味道。

楼下行走在鹅卵石上的脚步声沙沙作响，讲话声像看不见的鸟儿一样飘了上来，阳光照进了房间。一定很晚了，他吃惊地向时钟望去，可是时针还指着午夜，昨天激动之中他忘了上弦。失去了时间的凭依，这使他不安，到底发生了什么事？这种茫然若失的感觉更增强了这种不安。他迅速振作起精神，走下楼去，心中忐忑不安并感到有些内疚。

餐厅里他母亲一人坐在通常坐的那张桌子旁。埃德加松了一口气，他的敌人没有在，不会看到那张可憎的面孔了，昨天他在愤怒中曾用自己的拳头把那张面孔狠狠揍了一顿。可当他靠近那张桌子时，他感到慌乱了。“早晨好。”他问候母亲。

他母亲没有回答。她眼都没抬一下，而是用异常呆滞的瞳仁望着远处的景色。她显得非常苍白，眼圈留有淡淡的一层红晕，鼻翼神经质地抽搐着，显露出她的激动。埃德加咬紧嘴唇。这种沉默使他不知所措。他不知道昨天是不是把男爵伤得很重，也不清楚她是否知道夜里的那场殴打。这种茫然无知在折磨他。她的面孔仍是那样呆滞，这使他根本不敢望她一眼，害怕她现在低垂的眼睛会骤然从沉重的眼皮后面跳出来把他抓住。他变得安静极了，一点声响也不敢弄出来，他小心翼翼地拿起杯子，又把它放了回去，偷偷地望了一下母亲的手指。她非常烦躁地玩着汤匙，弯曲的手指显露出她内心的狂怒。就在这种透不过气的感觉中他坐了一刻钟，期待着什么，但它并没有到来。一句话也没有，没有一句话能使他从窘迫中解脱出来。他母亲站了起来，根本不理睬他。现在埃德加还不知道他该怎么做：独自留在桌旁，还是跟随她去？最后他还是站起身来，低声下气地跟在她的后面。她飞快地掠他一眼，同时感到他的尾随是多么可笑。埃德加把步子放得越来越小，以便跟她拉开一段距离，可她毫不注意他，径直回到自己的房间去了。当埃德加也走到门口时，房门已经紧紧锁上了。

这是怎么啦？他完全不得要领。对昨天发生的事他不再那么自信了。难道他昨天的袭击不对吗？他们是在准备对他进行惩罚还是新的侮辱？他感觉到一定要出事，很快就会发生可怕的事。处于他与他们之间的是一场即将到来的暴风雨前的闷热，是带电的两极所产生的电压，只有闪电才能把它释放掉。带着这种预感的重负，他孤独地熬过了四个钟头，在房间里走着，他那细长的颈背被看不见的重量压得抬不起来。中午，当他来到餐厅桌子前，已完全是一副忍气吞声的样子了。

“你好，妈妈。”他又说道。他得打破这种沉默，打破这种可怕的沉默，像一片阴云那样悬在他头上的沉默。

母亲仍不予回答，仍不理睬他。怀着一种新的惶恐，埃德加觉得她现在对他的怒火是深思熟虑的，是积蓄已久的，这种火气他生平还从没有遇到过。过去她发火总是只爆发一通了事，更多的是神经质的，而不是感情上的，并且一会儿就变成抚慰的笑容了。可这次他觉察出这是从她内心最深处迸发出的一种狂暴的感情，他对这个不小心招来的强大压力感到吃惊。他几乎无法进餐，在他的喉咙里翻腾着某种干枯的东西，使他感到窒息。他母亲像什么也没有看到。只是在她起身时，才像是漫不经心地转过身来说：“待会儿上楼来，埃德加，我有话同你说。”

这语气没有威胁的味道，却那样冷冰冰的，使埃德加悚然，就像有人突然把一副铁链套在他的脖子上。他的傲气消失了，像一条被痛打的狗一样，默默地随着她上楼，进入房内。

她有几分钟一声不响，用这种办法继续折磨他。这几分钟里，他听到钟的滴答声，他听到外面孩子的笑声，他听到自己的那颗心在胸膛里怦怦跳动。但是她也不是那么信心十足的样子，因为她现在对他讲话时，不是看着他而是背着他。

“我不想再谈你昨天的所作所为。这简直是闻所未闻，我一想到这事，就感到丢脸。这种后果是你自己造成的。我现在只想告诉你，你单独在大人中间这是最后一次了。我已经给你爸爸写了信，得给你找一个家庭教师或者送你去寄宿学校，好去学一些礼貌。我不想再为你烦恼了。”

埃德加垂着头站在那儿。他觉得这只是一个开场白，一个威吓罢了，正题还在后面，他不安地等待着。

“你现在立即去给男爵赔礼。”

埃德加一怔，但是她不让打断她的话。

“男爵今天已动身走了，你得给他寄封信，我口授你写。”

埃德加又是一怔，但他母亲的口气是坚定的。

“不许还嘴。那是纸和墨水，坐下。”

埃德加抬头望去，她的眼睛显出果断和坚定。他从没看到他母亲是这样严厉、专横。他害怕起来。他坐在那里，拿起钢笔，但是把脸深深伏在桌上。“上面写上日期。写了吗？称呼之前空一行！这样写：非常尊敬的男爵先生！惊叹号。再空一行。我十分遗憾地获悉——写了吗？——十分遗憾地获悉，您已离开了塞默林——塞默林是两个m——因此我想到只能写信——写快一点，字不一定写得很讲究！——来请您原谅我昨天的鲁莽。正如我母亲告诉您的，我尚处在一次重病的康复时期，易受刺激。我经常把看到的事加以夸大，但随即就感到后悔……”

俯在桌上弓着的背脊倏地直了起来。埃德加转过身来，他的悖逆精神又苏醒了。

“这我不写，这不是真的！”

“埃德加！”

她用这声音来威胁他。

“这不是真的，我没有做什么可后悔的事。我没有做什么坏事，为什么要赔礼？我只是在你喊叫的时候来救你的！”

她的嘴唇变得毫无血色，鼻翼在翕动着。

“我呼救了？你疯了！”

埃德加火了。他猛的一下跳了起来。

“是的，你呼救过，在外面的过道上，昨天夜里，当他抓住你的时候。‘您放开我，您放开我。’您这样喊的，声音很大，我在房间里都听见了。”

“你撒谎，我从没有同男爵在过道里待过，他只是陪我走到楼梯……”

这种大胆的谎言使埃德加跳动的心为之一停。她的声音并未吓住他，他用晶亮的眼珠凝视着她。

“你……没有……在过道上？他……他没有把你抓住？没有用暴力搂住你？”

她笑了起来。一种冷酷的、干涩的笑。

“你在做梦。”

这对孩子来说太过分了。他现在知道大人会撒谎，会说些卑微的、大胆的遁词，会说狡猾的和模棱两可的话。但是，这种厚着脸皮的冷冰冰的否认，当面撒谎，可实在把他惹急了。

“那这伤痕也是我在做梦？”

“谁知道你同谁打了架？可我不要和你争论，你必须听话，去把信写完。坐那儿去，写！”

她瘫软无力，在用最后的力量支撑住自己。

但是现在埃德加内心却连最后一点信任的火花也熄灭了。人们竟然可以像踏灭一根燃着的火柴棍那样来践踏真理，这他想不通。他觉得身上冰冷，全身瑟缩。他所说的话都变得尖刻、恶毒和肆无忌惮：

“那么，我是在做梦？在过道里，还有这儿的伤痕都是做梦？你们两人昨天在那儿，在月光中闲逛，还有他要领你往下走，这难道也是做梦？你以为我会像娃娃那样让人锁在房间里！不！不！我才不像你们想的那么傻呢。我知道我所知道的事。”

他放肆地紧盯着她的脸，这下她的力量全垮了，她不敢去看自己孩子的脸，这就在眼前的、被仇恨弄得扭曲了的脸，她的愤怒狂暴地发作起来了。

“去，你必须马上写！要不……”

“要不怎么？……”现在他变得十分大胆，声音带着挑衅的味儿。

“要不我就要像打小孩似的打你。”

埃德加走近了一步，只是嘲弄地笑着。这时她伸手就打了他一记耳光。埃德加叫了起来，他像一个淹在水里的人用双手扑打着四周。又是一记，他耳朵里闷响起来，两眼冒金星，他盲目地挥舞着拳头，回击过去。他觉得他打着一块软东西，是打在脸上了，他听见一声叫喊……

这声叫喊使他恢复了常态。突然他看到了自己，他意识到这事不得了了：他打了自己的母亲，羞耻和震惊，剧烈的恐惧袭击着他，他感到非逃不可，钻到地里，逃啊，逃啊，只要不再看到这目光。他跑出门，冲下楼去，穿过房子来到大街上，逃啊，逃啊，像是后面有条疯狗在追他似的。

初步领悟

他跑得很远，后来在路边上停住了。他必须抓住一棵树，由于恐惧和激动，他的四肢还在剧烈地颤抖，大口地喘着粗气。他一手酿成的恐怖在后面追赶他，抓住了他的喉咙，把他摇来晃去，像发高烧似的。他现在该怎么办？逃到哪里去？这里，已经是镇外的森林中了，离他住的地方有一刻钟的路程，他有一种被遗弃的感觉。自从他孤立无援以来，这里的一切都好像变了样，显得更加充满敌意，更加令人憎恶。这些树木昨天还友好地对他沙沙作响，可现在却突然阴沉地咆哮起来，像是一种威胁。这一切，他眼前的一切还要变得更加陌生和疏远吗？面对着这广袤而生疏的世界，这种孤独感使孩子感到头晕目眩。不，他还不能承受这一切，他还不能单独承受这一切。可是他该逃到哪里去？回家去，他怕他父亲，他父亲很容易发火，很严厉，会立即把他送回来的。他不愿意回去，宁愿逃到危险的没有熟人的陌生地方去；他觉得他永远不能再见他母亲的面了，一见到就会想到他曾用拳头打过她。

这时他想起了祖母，这个和蔼慈祥的老人，从他小时候起就溺爱他，每当他做了错事受到责骂时，她总是他的保护者。他想到巴登去躲在她那里，等到父母亲火气消了，再从那里给他们写一封信，向他们赔礼。在这一刻钟的时间里，他是如此沮丧，只身处在这世界上，有的只是一双软弱无力的手。他诅咒他的傲慢——被一个陌生人用谎言所激起的他那愚蠢的傲慢，想重新做一个从前那样的孩子，听话、忍耐、不自负；他现在已经感觉到这种自负夸张到了多么可笑的程度。

可是怎么到巴登去？怎么翻过这山川河谷？他急忙用手掏了掏总是随身带着的钱包。上帝保佑，那个崭新的、二十克朗的金币还在熠熠闪亮，这是他生日的礼物。他一直舍不得把它花掉，几乎每天都要看看它是否还在。望着它他感到愉快，觉得自己很有钱，随后总是怀着一种温柔的心情用手帕把它擦得亮亮的，像个小太阳在闪光。但是这点钱够用吗？这个骤然袭来的念头使他感到惊慌。在他的生活中他经常乘坐火车，可从来没想过坐火车得付钱，也没想过要花多少钱，是一个克朗还是一百个克朗。他初次感受到，生活里有许多事过去想都没想过，他周围各种各样的事都有一种固有的价值，一种特殊的重量。他在一小时之前还自以为什么都懂，现在感到，在他不知不觉之中，千百个秘密和问题从他身旁溜了过去。他感到羞愧的是他那贫乏的智慧在他步入生活的第一个台阶时就无能为力了。他越来越胆怯。他往下面的车站走去，步子越来越小，越来越犹豫。他经常梦想这样的逃遁，想进入生活干番大事业，成为皇帝或国王，英雄或诗人。而现在他畏葸地望着那儿的一座明亮的小房子，心里想的只是一件事，那就是到祖母那里去这二十个克朗够不够。路轨闪着光亮通向远处，火车站空空荡荡，冷冷清清。埃德加胆怯地走近售票处，为了不让别人听到他的话，悄声地问，到巴登去的车票要多少钱。一张惊奇的脸从昏暗的隔板后往外望了望，两只眼睛在眼镜后面朝这个怯生生的孩子微笑着。

“一张整票？”

“对。”埃德加结结巴巴地说。一点也不傲慢了，直怕钱不够。

“六个克朗！”

“要一张！”

他轻松地把他所钟爱的那枚光滑的金币递了上去，多余的钱找了回来。埃德加一下子觉得自己又十分富有了，他现在手上有了这张能够保证他自由的棕色车票，而他口袋里的银币则在发出沉浊的乐声。

从行车时刻表上他知道火车再过二十分钟就到了。埃德加躲到一个角落里。有几个人悠闲自在地站在站台上。可在这个不安的孩子看来，仿佛所有的人都在注视着他，似乎大家都感到奇怪，怎么这么小的一个孩子独自乘火车；他越来越往角落里缩，仿佛他的额头上明显地贴着逃跑和罪行这两条标记似的。他终于听到了火车从远处发出的长鸣声，随后就隆隆地驶近，这时他松了一口气。这列车将把他带入世界。上车时他才发现，他买的是三等车厢的票。过去，他从来都是坐头等车厢。他又觉得，这里的情形不一样，他遇到了各种各样的事。他周围的乘客都和以前的不一样，他的正对面是几个意大利工人，手很粗糙，声音沙哑，手里拿着铁锤和铲子，他们用迟钝而愁苦的眼睛望着前面。显而易见，他们在路上干了不少累活，因为几个人十分疲倦，在隆隆的列车上睡着了，张着嘴，倚在又脏又硬的靠板上。埃德加想，他们为了挣钱而去做工，但不知他们能挣多少钱。他又一次感到，钱不是一种常有的东西，得想办法去挣。现在他第一次意识到，他以往理所当然地习惯的是舒适的气氛，而他生活的两旁，左边和右边，却是黑洞洞的、看不到底的深渊。这是他的目光过去从没有觉察到的。他第一次知道了有各种职业，有各种规定，他周围有各种秘密，离他很近，可就从来没有注意过。自从埃德加单独一个人以来，这一小时他就学到了许多东西，他开始将目光透过这狭窄的车厢的窗户，瞭望外面的大千世界。在他那晦暝的恐惧之中有某种东西正开始在悄悄地滋长，这虽然还不是幸福，但却是对丰富多彩的生活的一种惊叹。在每一瞬间，他都感觉到，他的出逃是由于恐惧和怯懦，但这是他第一次独立行动，从现实中来体验以往从他身边一掠而过的一切。他也许第一次成了他父母亲的秘密，正如这个世界从前对他是个秘密一样。他用另一种目光望着窗外。他觉得仿佛第一次看到这现实中的一切，仿佛事物外面罩着的轻纱抖落了，向他展示了一切，展示了事物意向的内蕴、它们活动的秘密神经。路旁的房舍像被风刮走似的飞驶而过，他不由得想到了住在里面的那些人，不论他们是穷是富，幸或不幸，不论他们是不是像他一样渴望知道一切，也不论那儿有没有像他一样把什么事都当作游戏的孩子。他第一次觉得，站在路旁挥动小旗的护路工人并非是活动木偶和没有生命的玩具，并非可以任意搁置的物件，而他从前却是这样想的；他懂了，他的命运就是同生活作斗争。车轮滚得越来越快，现在列车沿蛇形线冲下山去，群山变得越来越矮小，越来越遥远，车已进入了平原地带。他再次回头瞭望，群山与蓝天渐渐交融，只是依稀可辨，遥不可及。埃德加觉得，他的童年就要慢慢消散在那雾蒙蒙的天际了。

纷扰的晦暝

列车停了下来，巴登到了，埃德加独自上了站台。这时华灯初上，信号灯向远方闪着绿的、红的光。看到这色彩缤纷的灯光，不觉想起夜已临近，心里骤然产生一种恐惧。要是白天倒还好，因为四周都是人，他可以休息，坐在椅子上，或者看看商店的橱窗。可是现在人都回家了，每个人都有一张床，闲谈一番，然后度过一个恬静的夜，而这时他却怀着负疚之感孤单地踯躅街头，孤寂而又生疏，这他怎能忍受得了。啊，要赶快找一个蔽身之处，一分钟也不要待在空旷而陌生的天幕下面，这是他唯一明晰的念头。

他沿着那条熟悉的路匆匆走着，无暇左顾右盼，一直走到他祖母的寓所。这所房子坐落在一条宽阔的大街上，但不是那么显眼，前面是一个拾掇得很好的花园，长着各种蔓生植物和常青藤，在这片绿荫的后面，一座洁白的、令人感到亲切的老式房子在闪着光辉。埃德加像个生人似的从栏栅外往里面窥望。里面什么动静也没有，窗户都关着，显然大家都同客人到后面花园里去了。当他的手刚接触到门铃时，发生了一件奇怪的事情：他突然感到，他两个钟头一直想得那么容易、那么理所当然的事却是不可能的。他该怎样进去，怎么向他们打招呼，怎样承受那些问题，怎么回答他们？当他不得不说他是从母亲那里偷着逃出来的时候，怎样去忍受他们的第一瞥目光？怎么去解释他闯下的大祸，他自己都无法理解的行动？这当儿里面有一扇门开了，突然，一种愚蠢的恐惧攫住了他：马上要有人出来了。他拔腿就跑，也不辨东南西北。

跑到公园前他停住脚步，因为那儿一片黑暗，他猜想不会有什么人能看见他。也许他可以在那里坐下来，安静地思考思考，好好休息休息，弄清楚他的遭遇。他畏葸地走了进去。前面有几盏灯亮着，照得嫩叶闪耀出阴森的水光，呈现出晶莹剔透的碧绿；往后，走下山丘，那儿的一切像一堆郁闷的、黑色的发酵物似的团聚在早春之夜的晦暝里。埃德加怯生生地从一些人身边溜了进去，他们都坐在电灯光下聊天或看书。他要独自待着。可是，就是在没有灯光的甬道暗处也不宁静。这里的一切都是怕光的，声音微弱，都在喁喁私语，其中更混杂着风吹树叶的沙沙声，远处脚步的拖沓声，压低嗓门的耳语声和某种欢愉的、呻吟的、充满恐惧的喘息声，这些声音是人和动物以及不肯安睡的大自然同时发出来的。这是一种危险的不安，一种压抑的、隐蔽的、令人畏惧的谜一样的不安。林中地下也有某种声音，这也许是同春天连在一起的蛰动声。这个无依无靠的孩子害怕得要命。

在昏黑的暗处，他蜷缩在一条椅子上，在考虑他到家后该讲些什么。可是，每当他要集中思想时，它就从身旁滑了过去。他不由自主地老在谛听黑暗中低沉的响动，神秘的声音。这黑暗是多么可怕呀，可又是多么迷惘、神秘的美啊！把所有这些窸窣声、沙沙声、嗡嗡声都混在一起的是动物还是人，或者仅仅是风的魔手？他谛听着。是风，它不安静地在林中穿行，但也是人——现在他看清楚了——是相互搂抱着的对对情侣，他们从山下灯光通明的城市走上来，他们谜一般地在这里出现，使黑暗也活跃起来。他们要干什么？他无法理解。他们彼此不说话，因为他听不到说话声，只有脚踩在鹅卵石上发出的沙沙声。他时而看到他们的身形在光亮处像影子一样地一掠而过，都是紧紧地搂得像一个人似的，这和先时他看到他母亲同男爵的情形一样。这个秘密，这个巨大的、闪光的和充满不祥的秘密，这里也有啊。现在他听到越来越近的脚步声和一种压低了的笑声。他感到恐惧，怕走近来的人在这儿发现他，于是他又往暗处缩了缩。这时从不辨五指的黑暗中有两个人摸索着往山上走，并没有看见他。他们搂抱着走了过去，埃德加松了一口气，可是他们突然停了下来，就站在他的椅子跟前。他们把脸贴在一起，埃德加什么也看不清楚，他只听到从女人嘴里发出来的喘气声，男的则喃喃着一种火热的、荒唐的话语。他打了个欢愉的寒战，恐惧之中有一种压抑的预感。他俩停了一分钟，随后鹅卵石在他们脚下发出沙沙的声音，脚步不久就在黑暗中消失了。

埃德加一阵颤抖。现在血又在血管里翻腾起来，比以前任何时候都更加炽热。在这纷扰的黑暗之中他突然感到寂寞难忍。不可遏止的需求主宰了他，他需要亲切的声音，需要拥抱，需要明亮的房间和他所爱的人。他觉得，这纷扰的夜晚的全部黑暗仿佛都沉到了他的心灵深处，进出他的胸膛。他跳了起来。回家，回家，回到家里，什么地方都行，在温暖、明亮的房间里，与亲人在一起。他们对他能怎么样呢？打也好，骂也好，自从他感受到了这种黑暗的滋味和寂寞的恐惧以来，他什么都不怕了。

这种想法驱使他往前走去，不知不觉他突然站在祖母寓所的门前了，手又重新摸着冰冷的门铃。他看到，现在窗户透过绿阴闪着光亮，在想象中，看到每扇明亮的玻璃后面的熟悉的房间里都有人在里面。这种亲昵感使他感到幸福，这种乍到的安适感使他与他所爱的人靠近了。如果说他还在犹豫的话，那只是为了更亲切地享受这种预感。

这时在他身后响起一声刺耳的尖叫：

“埃德加，他在这儿！”

祖母的女仆看见了他，向他扑来，抓住他的手。里面的门开了，一只狗跳到他面前汪汪直叫，屋里的人拿着灯走了出来，他听到欢叫声和惊叹声，呼喊和脚步混成一片的嘈杂声，越来越近。现在他认出来了，最前面的是祖母，她张开了胳膊，在她后面竟是他的母亲，他以为自己是在做梦。他的眼睛哭肿了，他颤抖着，畏葸地处在这激动的感情中间，他无所措手足，不知该做什么，该说什么，甚至连他感觉到什么也不清楚：是恐惧还是幸福。

最后的梦

事情原来是这样的：他们早就在这儿找他、等他很长时间了。他母亲尽管在气头上，却也对这激动的孩子破门而出感到惊慌，她叫人在塞默林到处寻找。正当大家都激动不安，纷纷做出各种危险的猜测时，有位先生带来消息说，他三点钟前后在车站售票处见到过这孩子。人们很快从车站得知埃德加买了一张去巴登的车票。她毫不迟疑地立即去追赶他，并事先电告巴登和维也纳他父亲处。一片忙乱和激动，两个钟头以来，一切都为寻找这个逃亡者而忙乱着。

现在他们牢牢地抓住了他，但并不是用暴力。他怀着一种受到抑制的胜利感被领进房间里。可是使他奇怪的是，他没有受到他们的严厉斥责，他在他们眼里看到的是欢欣和爱抚。就算是斥责吧，这种假装的生气，也只是一转眼的工夫。随后祖母又含泪搂抱着他，没有人再说他的过错了，他感到围绕他的是一种奇怪的关怀。这时女仆脱下他的上衣，给他拿来一件暖和的。祖母问他饿不饿，需要些什么。他们都很关心地挤过来围着他，但是当他们看到他的窘态时，就不再问他什么了。他快意地重新感觉到了那种曾受他藐视但却是不可缺少的孩子的感情。他对自己近来的自负傲慢感到羞愧难当，现在他得到的特殊宠爱，是他用自己的孤独所赢得的虚假快乐换来的啊！

隔壁房间里的电话铃响了，他听到他母亲在接电话，听到她说的几个字：“埃德加……回来了……到这儿来……坐末班车。”埃德加感到奇怪的是，她不再对他火冒三丈，只是搂抱着他，用奇怪的、欲言又止的目光望着他。他越来越懊悔，最好能避开这里祖母、姑妈的悉心关怀，进去请她原谅，十分恭顺地、单独一个人对她说，他要重新成为一个听话的孩子。可当他轻轻站起来时，祖母稍感惊慌地问道：

“你要到哪儿去？”

他羞愧地站着。他只要一动，他们就为他感到害怕。他把他们大家都给吓怕了，怕他再度逃走。他们怎么能够理解，对这次逃跑，他自己比任何人都感到后悔呢！

饭桌摆好了，给他端来一份赶做的晚饭。祖母坐在他身边，两眼一直不离开他。她和姑妈以及女仆静静地把他围住，他在这种温暖的气氛里感到十分安适。只有母亲没有进来，这使他惶惑。要是她知道他现在是多么低声下气的话，那她准会来的！

这时从外面传来辚辚的车声，随即在门前停了下来。其他人都惊讶起来，埃德加也感到不安。祖母走了出去，黑暗中，各种声音传来传去，他突然知道他父亲来了。埃德加羞怯地发觉，他现在又是一个人独自在房间里。即使是这短暂的孤独也使他感到慌乱。他父亲是严厉的，他是他唯一真正害怕的人。埃德加细心地谛听，他父亲好像很激动，说话声音很高，很恼火。这中间，听见他祖母和他母亲的令人宽慰的声音，显然她俩要他说话温和些。但是父亲的声音一直是生硬的，像他正在走来的脚步声一样，这脚步越来越近，已经到了旁边的一个房间，来到门前，现在门打开了。

他父亲个子很高，埃德加此刻在父亲面前觉得说不出的渺小。他走了进来，满脸火气，看来确实正在气头上。

“这是怎么回事，你这小子竟然逃跑了？你怎么能这样使你母亲担惊受怕？”

他的声音很愤怒，双手急剧地摆动着。现在他母亲轻轻走了进来，脸上罩了一层暗影。

埃德加没有回答。他想必须为自己辩解，可是他该怎么讲他被骗被打的事呢？父亲会理解吗？

“呶，你不会说话？是怎么回事？你可以慢慢地说！你有什么不对的地方？你逃跑总得有个理由嘛！有人委屈了你？”埃德加在犹豫。回忆使他又愤恨起来，差点儿要说了。这时他看到他母亲在父亲背后做了个奇怪的动作，他的心静了下来。母亲的这种动作开头他并不理解，可现在她在看着他，眼里流露出乞求的神情。她轻轻地、非常轻地把手指放在嘴上，做了个不要说的动作。

孩子感到，突然间一种温暖的感情，一种巨大的狂喜流过他的全身。他明白了她要他保守秘密，他觉得他那小小的嘴唇可以决定一个人的命运。她信赖他，他全身浸透着骄傲。猝然之间，他产生了一种自我牺牲的勇气，他要加重自己的过错，为了表明自己是多么值得信赖，自己是一个好汉。他鼓起勇气说：

“没有，没有……没有什么理由。妈妈对我非常好，可是我淘气，是我自己做错了……我……我逃跑了，因为我害怕。”

他父亲愕然地望着他。他一切都料到了，唯独没有料到这么个供词。他的愤怒无从发作。

“呶，你承认了错误，这很好。那我今天就不再谈这件事了。我想你得找个时间好好想想！不许再发生这样的事情。”

他站在那儿望着他，现在他的声音温和得多了。

“你脸色多么苍白啊。可是我觉得你又长高了一截。我希望你不要再耍小孩脾气了，你已经不是一个毛孩子，该懂得些事体了！”

埃德加一直都在望着他母亲。他觉得她的眼里闪着亮光，或许这是灯光的反射？不，那是湿润而晶莹的泪花，她的嘴上泛起一丝微笑，表明她对他的感激。他们现在把他带去睡觉，可他不再因为他们让他孤零零一个人在那里而感到悲哀了。他有多少东西，有多少丰富多彩的东西要思索啊。近日来在他生活中初次感受到的巨大的痛苦消失得无影无踪，他预感到未来的生活是神秘的，他有点陶醉了。在漆黑的夜里，窗外的树木在窸窣作响，但他不再感到恐惧。自从他知道生活是多么丰富以来，他对它就不再感到焦躁不安。他仿佛觉得今天是头一次看到赤裸裸的现实，这现实不再被童年的千百个谎言所遮蔽，而是呈现出它全部难以想象的、危险的未来。他从来没有想到，多姿多彩的生活中痛苦和欢乐竟然到处可以相互转换。而一想到他面前还有许多这样的时光，生活还深藏不露地等待着他惊喜地去揭开它的面纱时，他就感到快乐。现实生活的绚丽多彩，和对于多姿多彩的现实生活的朦胧预感的突然袭来，使他第一次相信他理解了人的本质，即使他们彼此充满敌意，他们也都相互需求，被他们所爱又是多么甜蜜啊。让他带着仇恨去想某件事，某个人，这是不可能的，他对什么都不悔恨，就是对男爵，那个勾引者，他的势不两立的敌人也不怨恨，他对他有了一种新的感激之情，因为他给他打开了通向感情世界的大门。

在黑暗中去想这一切是甜蜜的，令人神往的。他昏昏欲睡，从迷梦中轻轻浮现出各种模糊不清的景象。这时他觉得门突然开了，好像有人轻轻走了进来。开头他不大相信，他太困了，怎么也睁不开眼睛。这时他觉得有人喘着气，用自己的脸柔和地、温暖地、甜蜜地揉擦着他的脸。他知道这是他母亲，她现在在吻他，用手在抚摩他的头发。他感到了亲吻，他感觉到她的泪水。他温柔地回答了母亲的爱抚，把这当作是和解，当作是对他的沉默的答谢。直到以后，多年以后他才认识到这泪水是一个老之将至的人的誓言。从现在起，她只属于他，属于她的孩子，这意味着她放弃风流生涯，意味着她与自己的欲念诀别。他不知道她也感激他，是他把她从一种无益的艳遇中拯救了出来；她就用这种拥抱把爱的既苦又甜的重负留给了他，像是一笔遗产。此刻，孩子对这一切还不理解，但是他觉得能这样被爱是太幸福了，他感到这种爱又把他同世界上最伟大的秘密交织在一起。

她从他身上松开了手，她的嘴唇离开了他的嘴唇，身影轻轻消失了，却留下一片温暖，他的嘴唇上还留有一股气息。一种甜蜜的欲望使他渴望温柔嘴唇的再度轻吻和亲切的拥抱，但是这种令人渴求的秘密的遐思美想业已被睡眠的阴影笼罩。几个小时以来的景象，又一次五彩缤纷地飞掠而过，他青年时代的书本又一次诱惑地翻了开来。随后孩子沉入睡乡，他生活中更为深沉的梦开始了。

此刻，只有这两个孩子在自己房间里。灯已经关了，她们之间是一片黑暗，只有两张床隐隐约约地有些发白。她们两人的呼吸非常轻微，别人还真以为她们已经睡着了呢。

“嗨！”一个孩子发声道。这是那个十二岁的女孩。她怯生生地在黑暗中轻声唤另一个。

“什么事？”另一张床上的姐姐答道。她也只不过比妹妹大一岁。

“你还醒着哪，这太好了。我……想跟你说点事……”

另外一个没有反应。只听到床上窸窸窣窣的声音。姐姐坐了起来，望着这边床上，期待着妹妹要说什么事，可以看到她的眼睛亮晶晶地闪着。

“你知道吗……我想跟你说……不过还是你先告诉我，你不觉得最近几天我们的小姐跟往常有点不一样吗？”

姐姐犹豫起来，在思索。“对，”她说，“不过我不知道到底是怎么回事。她不像以前那么严厉了。最近我有两天没做作业，她也没说什么。另外，她有点那样，我不知道怎么说。我觉得，她好像不管我们了。她总是在一边坐着，也不像以前那样跟我们玩了。”

“我觉得，她很伤心，又不想让人知道。现在她钢琴也不弹了。”

又是一阵沉默。

接着，姐姐提醒妹妹说：“你刚才想告诉我什么事？”

“是的，不过你对谁也不能说，真的，不能对任何人说，不能对妈妈说，也不能对你的好朋友说。”

“不说，我不说！”姐姐已经有些不耐烦了，“到底是什么事呀！”

“好吧……就是刚才，我们回来睡觉的时候，我突然想到我还没有向小姐道‘晚安’呢。这时我已脱鞋了，可我还是到那边她的房间去了。你知道吗，我是轻轻地、蹑手蹑足地过去的，想吓唬她一下。我小心翼翼地打开房门，开始我还以为她不在房间里呢，灯开着，可是没有看见她。突然——我吓了一大跳——我听见有人在哭。这下我发现，她躺在床上，没脱衣服，脑袋埋在枕头里。她哭得全身抽搐，吓得我恨不得缩成一团。可是她没有发现我。于是我又把门轻轻关上。我哆嗦得太厉害了，得在外面站一会儿，定定神。在门外我还清楚地听见她的哭声，我就赶紧跑了回来。”

她们两人又不吱声了。随后，其中一个非常小声地说：“可怜的小姐！”这颤抖的声音在屋里回旋，像一个正在消逝的低沉的音符。又是一片寂静。

“我真想知道，她为什么要哭？”妹妹开口说，“这些天她又没跟别人吵架，妈妈也没再没完没了地数落她，而我们两个肯定没有惹她生气。那她干吗哭得这么伤心呢？”

“我倒是有点儿明白。”姐姐说。

“那是为什么，告诉我，是为什么？”

姐姐犹豫了一下，最后说：“我想，她在恋爱了。”

“恋爱？”妹妹惊讶得跳了起来，“恋爱？爱上谁了？”

“难道你一点都没发现？”

“该不会是奥拓吧？”

“不会？难道他没爱上她吗？从他上大学以来，在咱们家已经住了三年了，以前从来没有陪过我们，而这几个月他突然天天来，那是为什么？小姐来我们家之前，他不论对我还是对你有过一点儿亲切的表示吗？可是现在，他整天围着你我转。我们老是与他巧遇，在人民公园，或者在城市公园，或者在普拉特[1]，凡是小姐带我们去的地方，总是会与他巧遇。你真的从来没有觉得这有点奇怪吗？”

妹妹听了大吃一惊，结结巴巴地说：

“对……对，这些我当然也注意到了。不过我总是想，这……”

她的声音变调了，没有再往下说。

“起先我也是这么想的。我们女孩子总是那么傻。不过我总算还是及时觉察到，他不过是拿我们做挡箭牌而已。”

现在两人都沉默了。这次对话似乎已经结束。两人都陷入沉思，或者也许已经进入梦乡了。

这时，妹妹又在黑暗中无可奈何地说了句：“那她为什么还要哭呢？他是喜欢她的呀。过去我一直以为，恋爱肯定是非常美好的。”

“我不知道，”姐姐十分茫然地说，“我原先也是这么想的，恋爱准是一件非常美好的事。”

然后，从疲倦困乏的嘴里又一次轻轻地、遗憾地飘出一句：“可怜的小姐！”

屋里终于寂静无声了。





第二天早上，她们不再谈论这件事了，但是两人都相互感觉得到，她们的思想都是围着同一件事情在转。她们两人互不搭理，都想回避对方。但是，当她们两人从侧面打量她们的女教师的时候，两人的目光又不由自主地相遇了。在饭桌上，她们观察奥拓，觉得这位在她们家住了多年的表哥，竟像是陌生人似的。她们并不和他说话，不过，在低垂的眼帘下，她们老是斜着眼睛，留神他是不是对小姐有所暗示。两个女孩的心都难以平静。今天她们也不去玩了，精神非常紧张，为了想对这个秘密探出个究竟，都心不在焉地摆弄着一些东西。晚上，她们中的一个只是淡淡地问了句，好似她自己并没把这事放在心上：“你又发现什么了吗？”——“没有。”另一个回了一句，接着便转过身去。她们两人都有点怕谈这件事似的。这样持续了几天。在默默的观察中，在拐弯抹角的侦探中，两个孩子不安地感觉到，在不知不觉中她们已接近了那个闪烁不定的秘密。

几天之后，一个孩子终于在饭桌上发现，女教师悄悄向奥拓挤了挤眼，而他则点了下头作为回应。女孩激动得发抖了。她的手在桌子底下悄悄摸了下姐姐的手。当姐姐转脸看她时，她冲着姐姐亮了一下眼睛。姐姐马上明白了这个暗示，也立即变得不安起来。

她们正要从饭桌边站起身来，女教师便对姑娘们说：“到你们自己的屋子去吧，去玩一会儿。我有点头疼，想休息半小时。”

两个孩子垂着眼睛，小心翼翼地相互碰了下手，好似在相互提醒。女教师刚走开，妹妹就蹦到姐姐跟前说：“注意，这会儿奥拓要到她房里去了。”

“当然，所以她才将我们支开的！”

“我们应当到她门口去偷听！”

“那要是有人来呢？”

“谁会来呀？”

“妈妈呗。”

妹妹吓了一跳，“对呀，那……”

“你知道吗，我有办法了！我呢，在门口偷听，你留在外面走廊上，要是有人来，就给我一个信号。这样，我就保险了。”

妹妹一脸的不高兴。“到时候你什么都不会告诉我！”

“一定全都告诉你！”

“真的，全都告诉我？……可别忘了，是全部呀！”

“肯定，人格担保。你听见有人来，就咳一声。”

两人在走廊上等着，哆哆嗦嗦地，心情十分激动，心跳也加速了。会发生什么事呢？两个孩子紧紧地挨在一起。

听见脚步声了，姐妹俩就马上闪开，躲进暗处。一点不错，果然是奥拓。他抓住门把，进屋后就把房门关上了。这时姐姐一个箭步跟了上去，耳朵紧贴门上，屏住呼吸，窃听屋里的动静。妹妹望着她，好眼馋。好奇心使她惴惴不安，她擅自离开了指定的岗位，悄悄溜了过来，可是被姐姐生气地赶了回去。她只好又在外面等着。两分钟，三分钟，她觉得简直像是一个世纪。她难以按捺住焦躁情绪，像是热锅上的蚂蚁来回转动。姐姐什么都能听到，而她却什么都不知道。她又气又急，都快要哭了。这时，那边第三个房间里有扇门关上了。她咳了一声，两人赶忙走开，进了自己的房间，气喘吁吁地站了一会儿，心跳得很厉害。

接着，迫不及待的妹妹催促说：“好啦……快告诉我吧！”

姐姐脸上现出严肃的神情，最后终于十分不解地、像是自言自语地说：“我真不明白这是怎么回事！”

“什么事？”

“这事真奇怪。”

“什么……是什么呀？”妹妹急匆匆地吐出这几个字。这时，姐姐试着回忆所听到的东西，妹妹过来挨着她，紧挨着她，生怕听漏一个字。

“这事非常奇怪……和我想象的完全不一样。我猜，他进房后一定是想拥抱她或者吻她，因为她对他说：‘别这样，我有很要紧的事和你谈。’钥匙插在里面的匙孔里，我什么也看不见，不过倒可以听得十分清楚。奥拓接着说：‘出什么事啦？’真的，我从来没有听见过他这么说话，你知道，他平时说话声音总是很大，一副大大咧咧的样子。这回他可是有些低声下气，所以我马上就觉得，他好像有些害怕。她肯定也察觉到了，他在撒谎，因为接着小姐就很小声地说了句：‘这事你早就知道了。’——‘不，我什么都不知道。’——‘真的吗？’小姐问道——她是这么伤心，伤心极了——‘那你为什么突然回避我？这八天来你没跟我说过一句话，你尽可能地躲着我，你也不跟孩子们一起走了，也不去公园了。对于你，难道我一下子变得这么陌生了吗？噢，你早就知道，因此才突然离我远远的。’他沉默了一会，然后说：‘我快要考试了，功课很忙，没时间再做别的，不这样不行。’这时候她又开始哭泣了，然后边哭边对他说，不过语气非常温和，并且怀着善意：‘奥拓，你干吗要撒谎呢？你还是说实话吧，你实在不该对我撒谎呀！我对你并没有提出任何要求，不过关于这件事，我们两人总应当说清楚吧，你知道我要对你说什么的，从你的眼睛里我已经看出来了。’——‘说……什么呀？’他结结巴巴地说，语气非常软弱。这时她就说……”

由于过分激动，姑娘一下子浑身战栗，再也说不下去了。妹妹更紧地挨着她。“什么呀……她又说什么了？”

“小姐说：‘我已经有了你的孩子！’”

妹妹像闪电似的，一下跳了起来，说：“孩子！孩子！这不可能呀！”

“可是小姐是这么说的。”

“你肯定没有听清楚。”

“没错，绝对没错！奥拓还把这句话重复了一遍；和你一样，他也跳了起来，还喊着：‘孩子！’小姐沉默了好长时间之后，问道：‘现在该怎么办？’后来……”

“后来怎么样？”

“后来你就咳了一声，我只好走开了。”

妹妹非常不安，两眼直愣愣地说：“孩子！这是不可能的。她的这个孩子在哪儿呢？”

“我也不知道。这也正是我不明白的问题。”

“也许在家里……在来我们这里之前。为了我们，妈妈当然不会允许她把孩子带来的。所以她才这么伤心。”

“得了吧，那时候他还根本不认识奥拓呢！”

两人又沉默了，一筹莫展，苦苦地左思右想，希望能弄明白。为此，两人都很苦恼。妹妹终于又说话了：“有个孩子，这完全不可能！她怎么会有孩子呢？她还没有结婚，只有结过婚的人才会有孩子，这点我是知道的。”

“也许小姐是结过婚的。”

“你别傻帽儿了，好不好，总不会是和奥拓吧。”

“为什么……？”

姐妹俩面面相觑，不知所措。

“我们可怜的小姐。”其中一个悲伤地说。她们两人不断地重复着这句话，最后变成了一声同情的叹息。这期间，她们两人的好奇心像火苗似的，在不断蹿升。

“不知道是女孩还是男孩？”

“谁知道呢！”

“你觉得怎么样……要是我去问问她……非常非常的……小心……”

“你疯了！”

“为什么？她跟我们很好呀。”

“你想到哪儿去了！这种事她是不会对我们说的。在我们面前她什么都不会说。要是我们进了她屋里，他们总是立即中止谈话，在我们面前换个话题，胡扯一通，好像我们还是小孩似的，我今年都十三岁了。你没必要去问她，对我们她总是撒谎。”

“可是，我实在很想知道这事。”

“你以为我不想知道？”

“你知道吗，其实我最不理解的是，奥拓竟然不知道这件事。要是自己有个孩子，自己总是应该知道的吧，就像人人都知道自己有父母一样。”

“他是装的，这个流氓，他老是装蒜。”

“不过这事他总不会装吧。就是……就是……只是他想耍弄我们的时候才装假……”

正在这时候，女教师进来了。两姐妹立即打住，装出在做作业的样子。但是，她们两人都从旁边窥察她。她的眼睛好像哭红了，声音也比平时低沉，而且有些颤抖。两个孩子非常安静。突然她俩以十分敬畏的目光怯生生地抬头看着女教师。她们心里老在想着这件事：‘她有个孩子，因此才如此悲伤。’想着想着，她们自己也伤感起来了。

第二天在饭桌上，她们十分意外地听到一个消息：奥拓要离开她们家了。他对舅父解释说，考试临近了，他该加紧复习功课，在这里干扰太多。他想到外面租一间房子，住一两个月，考完以后再回来。

两姐妹听到这么一番话，内心万分激动。她们料想，这一切与昨天她们听到的那番谈话之间肯定有着某种秘密的联系，凭自己敏锐的本能，她们感觉到，这是他胆怯的表现，是逃避行为。当奥拓向她们两人告别的时候，她们竟很没有礼貌地转过身去。可是，她们两人十分注意观察他站在女教师面前的神情。小姐的嘴唇抽搐一下，但却安详地一语不发，把手伸给他。

这几天两个孩子完全变了。她们不玩，也不笑，眼睛里也失去了往日那种活泼欢快、无忧无虑的光彩。她们的内心十分不安，无所适从，对周围所有的人她们都抱着极其不信任的态度。她们不再相信别人对她们说的话，在每句话后面她们都能洞察到谎言和阴谋。她们成天睁大眼睛，察言观色，注意周围的一举一动，捕捉人们的表情、脸上的抽搐、说话的语调。她们像影子似的猫在人家后面，她们在门外窃听，总想抓住点什么。她们竭力想从肩上摆脱这些秘密织成的黑暗罗网，或者至少可以从一个网眼里往这个现实世界瞥上一眼。过去的那种幼稚的信念，那种快快乐乐、无忧无虑的盲目轻信，从此已从她们身上掉落。随后，她们从被这些秘密压得又闷又憋的气氛中预感到山雨欲来的征兆，她们生怕错过这一瞬间。自从她们知道，周围充满谎言，自己也就变得坚韧，工于心计，甚至变得狡诈和善于说谎了。在父母面前，她们装得稚气天真，转眼就变得极其机智灵活。她们全部天性都化作了神经质的骚动不安，过去温顺柔和的眼睛现在变得火辣辣的，深沉莫测。她们一直在不停地侦察和窥视，但孤立无援，因此她们相互之间便更加相亲相爱。有时候，由于对感情的无知，仅仅为了满足烈火灼燃时对柔情蜜意的渴望，突然间她们会相互狂热地拥抱或者泪流满面。她们的生活中看似无缘无故的突然之间充满危机。

现在她们才知道有种种折磨人的事，对其中的一件她们感受最深。她们默默地、不言不语地打定主意，一定要让这位伤心至极的女教师快活一点。她们极为用功，认真做作业，互相帮助，安安静静，不发怨言，对老师可能提出的愿望和要求都事先做到。可是小姐对此毫无察觉，这使她们非常难过。在最近这段时间里，小姐完全变了。有时候两姐妹中的一个和她说话，她竟会一阵战栗，仿佛是从梦里惊醒的。她的目光总要先搜索一会儿才从远处收回来。她一坐就是几小时，似梦似幻地凝视着前方出神。姑娘们走路蹑手蹑脚，以免惊扰她。她们朦胧而神秘地感觉到，她此刻正在思念她那不知远在何方的孩子呢！她们内心深处日益萌发的女性的柔情，使她们越发喜欢这位现在变得如此温和、如此柔情的小姐了。她往日那种轻快、自信的脚步现在变得犹豫、谨慎了，她的动作也小心翼翼，拘谨稳重。从这一切变化中，她们感到她有一种隐蔽的悲伤。她们从未见她哭过，但是她的眼睑老是红红的。她们知道，小姐不愿意在她们面前流露自己的痛苦，因此她们也无法帮助她，这时她们两人感到一筹莫展。

有一次，当小姐将脸转向窗外，拿起手绢擦眼睛的时候，妹妹突然鼓起勇气，抓住她的手说：“小姐，最近这些时候您总是那么伤心，该不会是我们惹您生气了吧，是吗？”

小姐感动地看着她，用手抚摸她柔软的头发。“不，孩子，不是，”她说，“绝对不是你们。”说着，她温柔地吻了一下孩子的额头。

两个孩子的静观和洞察细致入微，凡在她们视线范围内发生的事情，一无遗漏。就在这几天，她们中的一个有次突然闯进屋去，听见一句话。仅仅只有一句，因为父母立即就缄口不语了，但是现在每一个字都会在两姐妹心里引起千百个猜测。“我也已经发现有些反常，”妈妈说，“我要找她来问问。”起先，这孩子以为是说她自己呢，几乎有点担心害怕，就赶忙跑去找姐姐商量对策，请求援助。可是，中午的时候她们发现，父母一直以审视的目光盯着小姐那张恍惚迷离、神不守舍的脸，然后又相互交换了眼色。

吃完饭，母亲随口对小姐说：“请您一会儿到我房里来一下，我有话和您说。”小姐娓娓点了一下头。姑娘们吓得直打颤，她们觉得，这会儿要出事了。

小姐一进房去，两个姑娘随即跟了过去。把耳朵贴在门上，察看各个角落，偷听和窥视，这些行为，对她们来说现在已经成为理所当然的事了。她们根本不再觉得这样做有什么不光彩，有什么放肆，她们只有一个想法：要掌握别人不让她们见到的一切秘密。于是她们便肆意偷听。但是，她们只能听到窃窃细语的声音，而她们自己却神经质地浑身直打颤，她们生怕什么都听不见了。

这会儿屋里有一个声音变得越来越大，这是她们母亲的声音，听起来恶狠狠的，像吵架一样。

“您以为大家都是瞎子，都没有觉察到这样的事吗？我可以想象，以您这样的思想和品德，您是怎样来完成您的职责的。我竟相信了这样一个人，将孩子委托于她。天知道，您是怎样耽误我的女儿的……”

小姐好像回辩了几句，但是她说得太轻，孩子们什么也听不见。

“借口，借口！任何一个轻浮女人总是能找到借口的。碰上一个男人就委身，什么都不加考虑。其余的事就等老天爷来帮忙。这样的人还想当教师，来教育人家的姑娘，这简直是恬不知耻。您总不会以为，在这种情况下我还会将您继续留在家里吧？”

孩子们在门外偷听，身上一阵阵打着寒噤。她们什么也没听懂，但是听到她们母亲怒气冲冲的声音，她们感到很害怕。此刻，小姐剧烈的低声抽泣就是唯一的回答。泪水涌出了孩子们的眼眶，而她们的母亲似乎火气越来越大。

“现在您是只知道哭了，不过我是不会因此而心软的。对像您这样一号人，我绝不同情。您现在怎么办与我毫无关系。您自己肯定知道，您该去找谁。对此我也不屑一问。我只知道，这么一个卑劣的毫无责任心的人在我家就是多待一天，我也不能容忍。”

“妈妈这样和她说话太卑鄙了。”姐姐咬牙切齿地说。

妹妹让这句大胆的批评吓了一跳。“可是，我们一点也不知道，小姐到底干了些什么事。”她结结巴巴地抱怨说。

“肯定没干什么坏事。小姐不会做坏事的。妈妈不了解她。”

“是啊，看她哭成这样，真让我害怕。”

“是的，这真可怕。不过，你看妈妈对她吼成那样，真是卑鄙，我告诉你，这很卑鄙。”

她踩着脚，眼里充满泪水。这时，小姐进屋来了，她显得十分疲惫。

“孩子们，今天下午我有点事，你们两人自己待着，我可以信得过你们吧？晚上我再来看你们。”

她一点没有觉察到孩子们激动的神情，她走了。

“你看见了吗？她眼睛都哭肿了。我真不明白，妈妈怎么能这样对待她。”

“可怜的小姐！”

这句充满同情、令人落泪的话又在屋里回旋。两个孩子愣愣地站在屋里。这时，妈妈进屋来了，问她们是不是愿意同她一起坐车出去转转。孩子们搪塞着，她们怕妈妈。可是，同时她们又非常生气，要辞退小姐的事妈妈对她们竟然只字不提。她们宁愿单独留在家里。她们像两只燕子，在这个窄小的笼子里飞来飞去，谎言和沉默的气氛真会让她们窒息。她们反复思考着，是否应当到小姐房里去，问问她，和她谈谈这件事，告诉她，妈妈冤枉她了，劝她留下来。可是，她们怕小姐又会因此而难受。何况，她们自己也感到害羞，因为她们所知道的这一切，都是悄悄躲在一边偷听来的。她们必须装傻，装得和两三个星期之前一样傻。所以，她们就只能自个儿待在房里，度过整个长得没有边际的下午，含着眼泪思索着，耳边始终回荡着那些可怕的声音：母亲那么凶狠、残忍、气鼓鼓的申斥和女教师悲痛欲绝的哭泣……

晚上，小姐匆匆地到她们房里来，向她们道了晚安。孩子们看见她走出去时难过得直哆嗦，她们多么想再同她说点什么啊！可是现在小姐已经走到门口，没想到她又突然转过身来——好像是被孩子们无声的愿望拉回来的——她眼里闪着泪水，湿润而忧郁。她抱住两个孩子，孩子们猛烈地抽泣起来，她再一次吻了她们，便匆匆走了出去。孩子们站在那儿，泪如雨下。她们感到，这是诀别。

“我们再也看不到她了！”一个哭着说。

“瞧着吧，明天我们放学回来她就不在这儿了。”

“也许我们以后能去看看她，那时候，她一定也会让我们看她的孩子的。”

“肯定，她多好啊！”

“可怜的小姐！”这一次是她们对自身命运的叹息。

“你能想象吗，没有她会怎样呢？”

“我绝不会再喜欢别的小姐的。”

“我也是。”

“谁也不会对我们这么好，而且……”

她不敢再说下去了。自从她们知道她有一个孩子之后，一种下意识的女性柔情使她们对女教师格外敬重。她们两人总是想着这件事，但现在已经不再是出于孩子气的好奇心，而是出于深切的感动和同情。

“咳，你听着！”一个孩子说。

“什么事？”

“你知道吗，我非常想在小姐走之前再让她高兴一下，这样也好让她知道，我们是非常喜欢她的，我们不像妈妈。你愿意吗？”

“那还用问！”

“我想了一下，她不是非常喜欢白玫瑰吗，所以我想，你猜怎么，明天早上我们上学之前就去买几枝来，稍后再放到她屋里去。”

“那什么时候放呢？”

“吃午饭的时候。”

“中午吧。”

“那时候她肯定已经走了。这样吧，我宁愿一早就出去，很快把花买回来，不让别人知道，然后就送到她房间里去。”

“好，我们明天早早起床。”

她们取来存钱罐，将所有的钱都倒了出来，一分不留。此时此刻，她们想到自己还有机会向小姐表示默默的、无私的爱意，她们心里就倍感欣慰。





第二天，她们起得很早。当她们用微微颤抖的手拿着盛开的美丽的玫瑰去敲小姐的房门时，屋里无人答应。她们以为小姐还睡着呢，便轻手轻脚地溜进屋去。可是屋里空无一人，床上的被子叠得整整齐齐，显然无人睡过，屋里的东西十分凌乱。在深色桌布上放了几封信。

两个孩子大为吃惊。出什么事了？

“我去找妈妈。”姐姐果断地说。她倔强地站在母亲面前，目光阴沉、毫无畏惧地责问道：“我们的小姐在哪里？”

“她该在她自己的房间里吧！”母亲十分诧异地说。

“她的房间是空的，床没有睡过，昨天晚上她肯定就走了。为什么谁都不告诉我们？”

母亲根本没有注意到孩子说话时的那种凶狠的、挑战的口气。她吓得脸色煞白，立即到父亲的房里。父亲迅速跑进小姐的房间。

他一个人在屋里待了很久。来报信的这个孩子一直用愤懑的目光盯着母亲。母亲看起来很激动，但她的眼睛却不敢与孩子的目光相对。父亲从小姐的房里出来了，脸色灰白，手中拿着一封信。他和母亲回到自己房里，并且用极小的声音在与母亲说话。孩子们站在门外，突然，她们不敢偷听了。她们怕父亲发怒。他现在的这副样子是她们从来没有见过的。

此刻母亲从房里出来了，眼睛哭得红红的，显得六神无主的样子。孩子们好像是受了恐惧的驱使，下意识地向她走去，还想问个明白。可是母亲很严厉地说：“快上学去吧，已经不早了。”

这时，孩子们不得不走了。在学校里坐了四五个小时，像做梦似的夹在其他孩子中间，什么也没有听进去。一放学，她们就拼命往家跑。

家中一切照旧，只是大家似乎心里都有个可怕的念头。没有一个人说话，不过所有的人，甚至连佣人都怀着一种奇特的目光。母亲向孩子们迎过来，看来她准备跟她们说点什么。她开口说：“孩子们，你们的这位女教师不再回来了，她……”

她毕竟没敢把话说完。两个孩子的目光如此闪亮，如此咄咄逼人，如此可怕，直逼她们母亲的眼睛，以致她竟不敢再向她们撒谎了。她转身就走，急急忙忙逃回自己的房间。

下午，奥拓突然出现了。他是被人叫来的，因为有一封信是给他的。他的脸色十分苍白，神不守舍地在屋里时走时站，谁都不肯跟他说话，大家都在回避他。这时，他看见两姐妹蹲在墙角，便走过去，想跟她们打招呼。

“别碰我！”一个姑娘说，并对他感到万分厌恶。另一位则冲他啐了一口唾沫。他狼狈不堪，不知所措，又在屋里转了一会儿便走了。

没有人跟孩子说话，她们相互间也不交谈。她们像是笼中的动物，苍白，不安，一筹莫展。她们在各个房间里走来走去，两人常碰到一起，相互看着对方哭肿的眼睛，相对无语。现在她们什么都知道了。她们知道，别人都在欺骗她们，谁都可能卑鄙无耻，谎话连篇。她们也不再爱自己的父母了，她们不再相信他们。她们明白，以后对谁都不能信任，可怕的生活的全部重担今后都将落在她们自己瘦弱的肩上。她们仿佛从舒适欢乐的童年一下掉进了深渊。她们至今都不能理解发生在她们身边的这件可怕的事，但她们的思想恰恰就卡在这当口上，几乎将她们窒息而死。她们的面颊烧得通红，她们的目光充满凶狠和愤怒。她们走来走去，在寂寞中她们的心冷得像结了冰似的。谁也不敢跟她们说话，甚至连她们的父母也不例外，她们看人的样子非常可怕。她们不停地走来走去，这正是她们内心焦躁和骚动的反映。她们彼此不说话，两人心里却有和衷共济、休戚与共的感觉。沉默，这穿不破、猜不透的沉默，以及这没有呐喊和眼泪的痛楚是如此深沉，以致她们对每个人都感到陌生和危险。无人亲近她们，通向她们心灵的道路已经中断，也许好多年都不会通畅。她们周围的人都觉得她们是敌人，是坚定的、绝不原谅别人的敌人。因为从那天起，她们已经不再是孩子了。

就在这天下午，她们长大了好几岁。只是到了晚上，当她们单独待在黑暗的房间里时，才会再度产生儿童的恐惧：对孤独的恐惧，对死者画像的恐惧，以及对许多说不清的事物充满预感的恐惧。全家人一片慌张和忙乱，竟然没人想起给她们的房间生火。她们两人冷得爬到一张床上，用瘦弱的胳膊互相紧紧抱住，两个修长的尚未发育成熟的身体依偎在一起，好似在恐惧中寻找救援。可是，她们依然都不敢开口，但是妹妹此刻终于哭了，姐姐立即跟着猛烈地抽泣起来。她们紧紧地抱在一起哭，两人脸上热泪滚滚，从缓缓滴落到畅快直流。她们胸贴着胸，紧紧搂在一起，一声高一声低，彼此应和着对方的悲泣。她们两人有着相同的痛苦，成了同一个在黑暗中哭泣的身体。她们现在已经不再是为那个不幸的女教师而哭泣，也不是为她们即将失去父母而哭泣，而是因为一种剧烈的恐惧感震撼了她们，尤其是因为对这个陌生世界可能发生的一切感到恐惧，对于这个世界今天她们才向它投去可怕的一瞥。她们对自己正在进入的生活感到恐惧。这生活就像一片幽暗的树林，轰然耸立在她们面前，阴森可怕，望而生畏，可是她们又必须去穿越。渐渐地，她们两人混乱的恐惧变得越来越朦胧，像梦幻一样；她们的哭泣声也越来越微弱；她们两人的呼吸也缓缓地汇成一气，如同方才的眼泪一样。就这样，她们终于进入了梦乡。

一个陌生女人的来信


韩耀成　译

著名小说家R到山上去休息了三天，今天一清早就回到维也纳。他在车站上买了一份报纸，刚刚瞥了一眼报上的日期，就记起今天是他的生日。他马上想到，已经四十一岁了。他对此并不感到高兴，也没觉得难过。他漫不经心地窸窸窣窣翻了一会儿报纸，便叫了一辆小汽车回到寓所。仆人告诉他，在他外出期间曾有两人来访，还有他的几个电话，随后便把积攒的信件用盘子端来交给他。他随随便便地看了看，有几封信的寄信人引起他的兴趣，他就把信封拆开；有一封信的字迹很陌生，写了厚厚一叠，他就先把它推在一边。这时茶端来了，于是他就舒舒服服地往安乐椅上一靠，再次翻了翻报纸和几份印刷品；然后点上一支雪茄，这才拿起方才搁下的那封信。

这封信约莫有二十多页，是个陌生女人的笔迹，写得龙飞凤舞，潦潦草草，与其说是封信，还不如说是份手稿。他不由自主地再次把信封捏了捏，看看有什么附件落在里面没有。但是信封里是空的，无论信封上还是信纸上都没有寄信人的地址，也没有签名。“奇怪。”他想，又把信拿在手里。“你，与我素昧平生的你！”信的上头写了这句话作为称呼，作为标题。他的目光十分惊讶地停住了：这是指的他，还是指的一位臆想的主人公呢？突然，他的好奇心大发，开始念道：





我的孩子昨天去世了——为挽救这个幼小娇嫩的生命，我同死神足足搏斗了三天三夜，他得了流感，可怜的身子烧得滚烫，我在他床边坐了四十个小时。我用冷水浸过的毛巾，敷在他烧得灼手的额头上。白天黑夜都握着他那双抽搐的小手。第三天晚上我全垮了。我的眼睛再也抬不起来了，眼皮合上了，连我自己也不知道。我在硬椅子上坐着睡了三四个小时，就在这中间，死神夺去了他的生命。这逗人喜爱的可怜的孩子，此刻就在那儿躺着，躺在他自己的小床上，就和他死的时候一样；只是把他的眼睛，把他那聪明的黑眼睛合上了，把他的两只手交叉着放在白衬衫上，床的四个角上高高点燃着四支蜡烛。我不敢看一下，也不敢动一动，因为烛光一晃，他脸上和紧闭的嘴上就影影绰绰的，看起来就仿佛他的面颊在蠕动，我就会以为他没有死，以为他还会醒来，还会用他银铃似的声音对我说些甜蜜而稚气的话语。但是我知道，他死了，我不愿意再往床上看，以免再次怀着希望，也免得再次失望。我知道，我知道，我的孩子昨天死了——在这个世界上我现在只有你，只有你了，而你对我却一无所知，此刻你完全感觉不到，正在嬉戏取闹，或者正在跟什么人寻欢作乐，调情狎昵呢。我现在只有你，只有与我素昧平生的你，我始终爱着的你。

我拿了第五支蜡烛放在这里的桌子上，我就在这张桌上给你写信。因为我不能孤零零地一个人守着我那死去的孩子，而不倾诉我的衷肠。在这可怕的时刻要是我不对你诉说，那该对谁去诉说！你过去是我的一切，现在也是我的一切！也许我无法跟你完全讲清楚，也许你不了解我——我的脑袋现在沉甸甸的，太阳穴不停地在抽搐，像有槌子在擂打，四肢感到酸痛。我想，我发烧了，说不定也染上了流感。现在流感挨家挨户地蔓延，这倒好，这下我可以跟我的孩子一起去了，也省得我自己来了结我的残生。有时我眼前一片漆黑，也许这封信我都写不完——但是我要振作起全部精力，来向你诉说一次，只诉说这一次，你，我亲爱的，与我素昧平生的你。

我想同你单独谈谈，第一次把一切都告诉你，向你倾吐；我的整个一生都要让你知道，我的一生始终都是属于你的，而对我的一生你却始终毫无所知。可是只有当我死了，你再也不用答复我了，现在我的四肢忽冷忽热，如果这病魔真正意味着我生命的终结，这时我才让你知道我的秘密。假如我会活下来，那我就要把这封信撕掉，并且像我过去一直把它埋在心里一样，我将继续保持沉默。但是如果你手里拿到了这封信，那么你就知道，那是一个已经死了的女人在这里向你诉说她的一生，诉说她那属于你的一生，从她开始懂事的时候起，一直到她生命的最后一刻。作为一个死者，她再也别无所求了，她不要求爱情，也不要求怜悯和慰藉。我要求你的只有一件事，那就是请你相信我这颗痛苦的心匆匆向你吐露的一切。请你相信我讲的一切，我要求你的就只有这一件事：一个人在其独生子去世的时刻是不会说谎的。

我要向你吐露我的整个的一生，我的一生确实是从我认识你的那一天才开始的。在此之前我的生活郁郁寡欢、杂乱无章，它像一个蒙着灰尘、布满蛛网、散发着霉味的地窖，对它里面的人和事，我的心里早已忘却。你来的时候，我十三岁，就住在你现在住的那所房子里，现在你就在这所房子里，手里拿着这封信——我生命的最后一丝气息。我也住在那层楼上，正好在你对门。你一定记不得我们了，记不得那个贫苦的会计师的寡妇（她总是穿着孝服）和那个尚未完全发育的瘦小的孩子了——我们深居简出，不声不响地过着我们小市民的穷酸生活——你或许从来没有听到过我们的名字，因为我们房间的门上没有挂牌子，没有人来，也没有人来打听我们。何况事情已经过去很久了，过了十五六年了，不，你一定什么也不知道，我亲爱的，可是我呢，啊，我激情满怀地想起了每一件事，我第一次听说你，第一次见到你的那一天，不，是那一刻，我现在还记得很清楚，仿佛是今天的事。我怎么会不记得呢，因为对我来说世界从那时才开始。请耐心，亲爱的，我要向你从头诉说这一切，我求你听我谈一刻钟，不要疲倦，我爱了你一辈子也没有感到疲倦啊！

你搬进我们这所房子来以前，你的屋子里住的那家人又丑又凶，又爱吵架。他们自己穷愁潦倒，但却最恨邻居的贫困，也就是恨我们的穷困，因为我们不愿跟他们那种破落无产阶级的粗野行为沆瀣一气。这家男人是个酒鬼，常打老婆；哐啷哐啷摔椅子、砸盘子的响声常常在半夜里把我们吵醒，有一回那女人被打得头破血流，披头散发地逃到楼梯上，那个喝得酩酊大醉的男人跟在她后面狂呼乱叫，直到大家都从屋里出来，警告那汉子，再这么闹就要去叫警察了，这场戏才算收场。我母亲一开始就避免和这家人有任何交往，也不让我跟他们的孩子说话，为此，这帮孩子一有机会就对我进行报复。要是他们在街上碰见我，就跟在我后边喊脏话，有一回还用硬实的雪球砸我，打得我额头上鲜血直流。全楼的人都本能地恨这家人。突然有一次出了事——我想，那汉子因为偷东西给逮走了——那女人不得不收拾起她那点七零八碎的东西搬走，这下我们大家都松了口气。楼门口的墙上贴出了出租房间的条子。贴了几天就拿掉了，消息很快从清洁工那儿传开，说是一位作家，一位文静的单身先生租了这套房间。那时我第一次听到你的名字。

这套房间给原住户弄得油腻不堪，几天之后油漆工、粉刷工、清洁工、裱糊匠就来拾掇房间了，敲敲锤锤，又拖地、又刮墙，但我母亲对此倒很满意，她说，这下对门又脏又乱的那一家终于走了。而你本人在搬来的时候我还没有见到你的面：全部搬家工作都由你的仆人照料，那个个子矮小、神情严肃、头发灰白的管事的仆人，他轻声细语地、一板一眼地以居高临下的神气指挥着一切。他使我们大家都很感动，首先，因为一位管事的仆人在我们这所郊区楼房里，是件很新奇的事，其次他对所有的人都非常客气，但并不因此而降格把自己等同于一个普通仆人，和他们好朋友似的山南海北地谈天。从第一天起他就把我母亲看作太太，恭恭敬敬地向她打招呼，甚至对我这个丑丫头，也总是既亲切又严肃。每逢他提到你的名字，他总带着某种崇敬，带着一种特殊的尊敬——大家马上就看出，他对你的关系远远超出了普通仆人的程度。为此我多么喜欢他、多么喜欢这个善良的老约翰啊！虽然我忌妒他时时可以在你身边侍候你。

我把一切都告诉你，亲爱的，把所有这些鸡毛蒜皮的、简直是可笑的小事都告诉你，为的是让你了解，从一开始你对我这个又腼腆、又胆怯的孩子就具有那样的魔力。在你本人还没有闯入我的生活之前，你身上就围上了一圈灵光，一道富贵、奇特和神秘的光华——我们所有住在这幢郊区小楼里的人（这些生活天地非常狭小的人，对自己门前发生的一切新鲜事总是十分好奇的），都在焦躁地等着你搬进来。一天下午放学回家，看到楼前停着搬家具的车，这时对你的好奇心才在我心里猛增。家具大都是笨重的大件，搬运工已经抬到楼上去了，现在正在把零星小件拿上去；我站在门口望着，对一切都感到很惊奇，因为你所有的东西都那样稀奇，我还从来没有见过；有印度神像，意大利雕塑，色彩鲜艳的巨幅绘画，最后是书，那么多、那么好看的书，以前我连想都没有想到过。这些书都堆在门口，仆人在那里一本本拿起来用小棍和帚仔仔细细地掉书上的灰尘。我好奇地围着那越堆越高的书堆蹑手蹑脚地走着，你的仆人并没有叫我走开，但也没有鼓励我待在那里；所以我一本书也不敢碰，虽然我很想摸一摸有些书的软皮封面。我只好从旁边怯生生地看看书名：有法文书、英文书，还有些书的文字我不认识。我想，我会看上几个小时的；这时我母亲把我叫进去了。

整个晚上我都没法不想你；而这还是在我认识你之前呀。我自己只有十来本便宜的、破硬纸板装订的书，这几本书我爱不释手，一读再读。这时我在冥思苦索：这个人会是什么样子呢？有那么多漂亮的书，而且都看过了，还懂得所有这些文字，他还那么有钱，同时又那么有学问。想到那么多书，我心里就滋生起一种超脱凡俗的敬畏之情。我在心里设想着你的模样：你是个老人，戴了副眼镜，留着长长的白胡子，有点像我们的地理教员，只是善良得多，漂亮得多，温和得多——我不知道，为什么我那时就肯定你是漂亮的，因为当时我还把你想象成一个老人呢。就在那天夜里，我还不认识你，我就第一次梦见了你。

第二天你搬来了，但是无论我怎么窥伺，还是没能见你的面——这又更加激起了我的好奇心。终于在第三天我看见了你，真是万万没有想到，你完全是另一副模样，和我孩子气的想象中的天父般的形象毫无共同之处。我梦见的是一位戴眼镜的慈祥的老人，现在你来了——你，你的样子还是和今天一样，你，岁月不知不觉地在你身上流逝，但你却丝毫没有变化！你穿了一件浅灰色的迷人的运动服，上楼梯的时候总是以你那种无比轻快的、孩子般的姿态，老是一步跨两级。你手里拿着帽子，我以无法描述的惊讶望着你那表情生动的脸，脸上显得英姿勃发，一头秀美光泽的头发：真的，我惊讶得吓了一跳，你是多么年轻，多么漂亮，多么修长笔挺，多么标致潇洒。这事不是很奇怪吗？在这第一秒钟里，我就十分清楚地感觉到，你是非常独特的，我和所有别的人都意想不到地在你身上一再感觉到：你是一个具有双重人格的人，是个热情洋溢、逍遥自在、沉湎于玩乐和寻花问柳的年轻人，同时你在事业上又是一个十分严肃、责任心强、学识渊博、修养有素的人。我无意中感觉到后来每个人都在你身上感觉到的印象，那就是你过着一种双重生活，它既有光明的、公开面向世界的一面，也有阴暗的、只有你一人知道的一面——这个最最隐蔽的两面性，你一生的秘密，我，这个着了魔似的被你吸引住的十三岁的姑娘，第一眼就感觉到了。

现在你明白了吧，亲爱的，当时对我这个孩子来说，你是一个多大的奇迹，一个多么诱人的谜呀！一个大家对他怀着敬畏的人，因为他写过书，因为他在那另一个大世界里颇有名气，现在突然发现他是个英俊潇洒、像孩子一样快乐的二十五岁的年轻人！我还要对你说吗，从这天起，在我们这所楼里，在我整个可怜的儿童天地里，没有什么比你更使我感兴趣的了，我把一个十三岁的姑娘的全部犟劲，全部缠住不放的执拗劲一股脑儿都用来窥视你的生活，窥视你的起居了。我观察你，观察你的习惯，观察到你这儿来的人，这一切非但没有减少，反而更增加了我对你本人的好奇心，因为来看望你的客人形形色色，三教九流，这就反映了你性格上的两重性。到你这里来的有年轻人，你的同学，一帮衣衫褴褛的大学生，你跟他们有说有笑，忘乎所以；有时又有一些坐小汽车来的太太；有一回歌剧院的经理、那位伟大的乐队指挥来了，过去我只是怀着崇敬的心情远远地见到过他站在乐谱架前；到你这里来的人再就是些还在商业学校上学的小姑娘，她们扭扭捏捏地倏的一下就溜进了门去。总而言之，来的人里女人很多，很多。这一方面我没有什么特别的想法，就是一天早晨我去上学的时候，看见一位太太头上蒙着面纱从你屋里出来，我也并不觉得这有什么特别——我才十三岁呀，我以狂热的好奇心来探听和窥伺你的行动，这在孩子的心目中还并不知道，这种好奇心已经是爱情了。

但是，我亲爱的，那一天，那一刻，我整个地、永远地爱上你的那一天、那一刻，现在我还记得清清楚楚。我和一个女同学散了一会儿步，就站在大门口闲聊。这时开来一辆小汽车，车一停，你就以你那焦躁、敏捷的姿态——这姿态至今还使我对你倾心——从踏板上跳了下来，要进门去。一种下意识逼着自己为你打开了门，这样我就挡了你的道，我们两人差点撞个满怀，你以那种温暖、柔和、多情的眼光望着我，这眼光就像是脉脉含情的表示，你还向我微微一笑——是的，我不能说是别的，只好说：向我脉脉含情地微微一笑——并用一种极轻的、几乎是亲昵的声音说：“多谢啦，小姐！”

事情的经过就是这样，亲爱的；可是从此刻起，从我感到了那柔和的、脉脉含情的目光以来，我就属于你了。后来不久我就知道，对每个从你身边走过的女人，对每个卖给你东西的女店员，对每个给你开门的侍女，你一概投以你那拥抱式的、具有吸引力的、既脉脉含情又撩人销魂的目光，你那天生的诱惑者的目光。我还知道，在你身上这目光并不是有意识地表示心意和爱慕，而是因为你对女人所表现出的脉脉含情，所以你看她们的时候，不知不觉之中就使你的眼光变得柔和而温暖了。但是我这个十三岁的孩子却对此毫无所感：我心里像团烈火在燃烧。我以为你的柔情只是给我的，只是给我一人的，在这瞬间，我这个尚未成年的丫头的心里，已经感到自己是个女人，而这个女人永远属于你了。

“这个人是谁？”我的女友问道。我不能马上回答她。我不能把你的名字说出来：就在这一秒钟里，这唯一的一秒钟里，我觉得你的名字是神圣的，它成了我的秘密。“噢，一位先生，住在我们这座楼里。”我结结巴巴、笨嘴笨舌地说。“那他看你的时候你干吗要脸红啊？”我的女朋友使出了一个爱打听的孩子的全部恶毒劲冷嘲热讽地说。正因为我感到她的嘲讽触到了我的秘密，血就一下子升到我的脸颊，感到更加火烧火燎。我狼狈之至，态度变得甚为粗鲁。“傻丫头！”我气冲冲地说。我真恨不得把她勒死。但是她却笑得更响，嘲弄得更加厉害，直到我感到盛怒之下泪水都流下来了。我就把她甩下，独自跑上楼去。

从这一秒钟起，我就爱上了你。我知道，许多女人对你这个被宠惯了的人常常说这句话。但是我相信，没有一个女人像我这样盲目地、忘我地爱过你，我对你永远忠贞不渝，因为世界上任何东西都比不上孩子暗地里悄悄所怀的爱情，因为这种爱情如此希望渺茫，曲意逢迎，卑躬屈节，低声下气，热情奔放，它与成年妇女那种欲火中烧的、本能地挑逗性的爱情并不一样。只有孤独的孩子才能将他们的全部热情集中起来：其余的人在社交活动中滥用自己的感情，在卿卿我我中把自己的感情消磨殆尽，他们听说过很多关于爱情的事，读过许多关于爱情的书。他们知道，爱情是人们的共同命运。他们玩弄爱情，就像玩弄一个玩具，他们夸耀爱情，就像男孩子夸耀他们抽了第一支香烟。但是我，我没有一个可以向他诉说我的心事的人，没有人开导我，没有人告诫我，我没有人生阅历，什么也不懂：我一下栽进了我的命运之中，就像跌入万丈深渊。在我心里生长、迸放的就只有你，我在梦里见到你，把你当作知音：我父亲早就故世了，我母亲总是郁郁寡欢，悲悲戚戚，她靠养老金过活，生性懦怯，掉片树叶还生怕砸了脑袋，所以我和她并不十分相投；那些开始沾上了行为不端这坏毛病的女同学又使我感到厌恶，因为她们轻佻地玩弄那在我心目中视为最高的激情的东西——因此我把原先散乱的全部激情，把我那颗压缩在一起而一再急不可待地想喷涌出来的整个心都一股脑儿向你掷去。在我的心里你就是——我该怎么对你说呢？任何比喻都不为过分——你就是一切，是我整个生命。人间万物所以存在，只是因为都和你有关系，我生活中的一切，只有和你相连才有意义。你使我整个生活变了个样。原先我在学校里学习并不太认真，成绩也是中等，现在突然成了第一名，我读了上千本书，往往每天读到深夜，因为我知道，你是喜欢书的；突然我以近乎有点顽固的劲头坚持不懈地练起钢琴来了，使我母亲大为惊讶，因为我想，你是喜欢音乐的。我把自己的衣服刷得干干净净，缝得整整齐齐，好在你面前显得干净利索，让你喜欢；我那条旧学生裙（是我母亲的一件家常便服改的）的左侧打了一个四方的补丁，我感到难看极了。我怕你会看见这个补丁，因而瞧不起我；所以我上楼的时候，总是把书包压在那个补丁上，我吓得直哆嗦，生怕被你看出来。但是这是多傻啊：你后来再也没有，几乎是再也没有看过我一眼。

再说我，我整天都在等着你，窥伺你的行踪，除此之外可以说是什么也没做。我们家的门上有一个小小的黄铜窥视孔，从这个小圆孔里可以看到对面你的房门。这个窥视孔——不，别笑我，亲爱的，就是今天，就是今天，我对那些时刻也并不感到羞愧！——这个窥视孔是我张望世界的眼睛，那几个月，那几年，我手里拿了本书，整个下午整个下午地坐在那里，坐在前屋里恭候你，生怕妈妈疑心，我的心像琴弦一样绷得紧紧的，你一出现，它就不住地奏鸣。我时刻为了你，时刻处于紧张和激动之中，可是你对此却毫无感觉，就像你对口袋里装着的绷得紧紧的怀表的发条没有一丝感觉一样。怀表的发条耐心地在暗中数着你的钟点，量着你的时间，用听不见的心跳伴着你的行踪，而在它滴答滴答的几百万秒之中，你只有一次向它匆匆瞥了一眼。我知道你的一切，了解你的每一个习惯，认得你的每一条领带、每一件衣服，不久就认识并且能够一个个区分你那些朋友，还把他们分成我喜欢的和我讨厌的两类：我从十三岁到十六岁，每一小时都是生活在你的身上的。啊，我干了多少傻事！我去吻你的手摸过的门把手，捡一个你进门之前扔掉的雪茄烟头，在我心目中它是神圣的，因为你的嘴唇在上面接触过。晚上我上百次借故跑到下面的胡同里，去看看你那一间屋子亮着灯，这样虽然看不见你，但是清清楚楚地感觉到你在那里。你出门去的那几个星期——我每次见那善良的约翰把你的黄旅行袋提下楼去，我的心便吓得停止了跳动——那几个星期我活着像死了一样，毫无意义。我满脸愁云，百无聊赖，茫然若失，不过我得时时小心，别让母亲从我哭肿了的眼睛上看出我心头的绝望。

我知道，我现在告诉你的，全是些怪可笑的感情波澜，孩子气的蠢事。我该为这些事而害臊，但是我并不感到羞愧，因为我对你的爱情从来没有像在这种天真的激情中更为纯洁，更为热烈的了。我可以对你说上几小时，说上好几天，告诉你，我当时是怎么同你一起生活的，而你呢，连我的面貌还不认识，因为每当我在楼梯上碰到你，而又躲不开的时候，由于怕你那灼人的眼光，我就低头打你身边跑走，就像一个人为了不被烈火烧着，而纵身跳进水里一样。我可以对你说上几小时，说上好几天，告诉你那些你早已忘怀的岁月，给你展开你生活的全部日历；但是我不愿使你厌倦，不愿折磨你。我要讲给你听的，只有我童年时期最最美好的那次经历，我请你不要嘲笑我，因为这是一件微乎其微的小事，但是对我这个孩子来说，这可是件天大的大事。一定是个星期天。你出门去了，你的仆人打开房门，把那几条他已经拍打干净的、沉重的地毯拽进屋去。他，这个好人，干得非常吃力，我一时胆大包天，走到他跟前，问他要不要我帮他一把。他很惊讶，但还是让我帮了他，这样我就看见了你的寓所的内部，你的天地，你常常坐的书桌，桌上的一个蓝水晶花瓶里插着几朵鲜花，看见了你的柜子，你的画，你的书——我只能告诉你，我当时怀着多么大的崇敬，甚至虔诚的仰慕之情啊！对你的生活我只是匆匆地偷望了一眼，因为约翰，你那忠实的仆人，是一定不会让我仔细观看的，可是就是这么看了一眼，我就把整个气氛吸进了胸里，这就有了入梦的营养，就能无休止地梦见你，无论醒着还是睡着。

这，这飞快的一分钟，它是我童年时代最最幸福的时刻。我要把这时刻讲给你听，好让你这个并不认识我的人终于能开始感觉到有一个生命在依恋着你，并为你而消殒。这个最最幸福的时刻我要告诉你，还有那个时刻，那个最最可怕的时刻也要告诉你，可惜这两个时刻是互相紧挨着的。为了你的缘故——我刚才已经对你说过——我把一切都忘掉了，我没有注意我的母亲，对任何人都不关心。我没有注意到，一位年纪稍长的先生，一位因斯布鲁克的商人，我母亲的远亲，常常到我们家里来，每回都待得很久，是的，这倒使我感到很高兴，因为他有时带我母亲去看戏，这样我便可以独自待在家里，想着你，守候着你，这可是我的最大最大的、我的唯一的幸福！一天，母亲郑重其事地把我叫到她房间里，说要跟我一本正经地谈一谈。我的脸都吓白了，听到自己的心突然怦怦直跳：她会不会感觉到什么，看出了什么苗头？我马上想到的就是你，就是这个秘密，这个把我和世界联系在一起的秘密。但是妈妈自己却感到不好意思，她温柔地吻了我一两下（她平素是从来不吻我的），把我拉到沙发上挨她坐着，然后吞吞吐吐、羞怯地开始说，她的亲戚是个鳏夫，向她求婚，而她呢，主要是为了我，就决定答应他的要求。一股热血涌到我的心头：我内心里只有一个念头，我的全部心思都在你的身上。“我们还住在这儿吧？”我结结巴巴地勉强说出这句话来。“不，我们要搬到因斯布鲁克去，斐迪南在那里有座漂亮的别墅。”别的话我什么也没有听见。我觉得眼前发黑。后来我知道，当时我晕倒了；我听见母亲对等候在门后的继父悄声说话，我突然伸开双手往后一仰，随后就像块铅似的摔倒了。以后这几天里发生的事情，我，一个不能自己做主的孩子，是如何反抗她那说一不二的意志的，这些我都无法向你描述了：就是现在，一想到这件事，我正在写信的手还发抖呢。我真正的秘密是不能泄露的，因此我的反抗就显得纯粹是耍牛脾气，故意作对，成心别扭。谁也不再跟我说了，一切都在暗地里进行。他们利用我上学的时间搬运行李：等我回到家里，总是不是少了这样，就是卖了那件。我看着我们的屋子，我的生活变得零落了，有一次我回家吃午饭的时候，搬家具的人正在包装东西，把什么都搬走了。空空荡荡的屋子里放着收拾好了的箱子，以及母亲和我各人一张行军床：我们还要在这里睡一夜，最后一夜，明天就动身到因斯布鲁克去。

在这最后的一天，我怀着一种突然的果断心情感觉到，没有你在身边，我是不能活的。除了你，我想不出别的什么解救办法。我当时心里是怎么想的，在那绝望的时刻我究竟能不能头脑清楚地进行思考，这些我永远也说不出来，可是我突然站了起来，身上穿着学生装——我母亲不在家——走到对门你那里去。不，我不是走去的：我两腿发僵，全身哆嗦着，被一种磁石一般的力量吸到你的门口。我已经对你说过，我自己也不知道，我想干什么：跪在你的脚下，求你收留我做个女仆，做个奴隶，我怕你会对一个十五岁的姑娘的这种纯真无邪的狂热感到好笑的，但是——亲爱的，要是你知道，我当时如何站在冰冷的楼道里，由于恐惧而全身僵硬，可是又被一种捉摸不到的力量推着朝前走；我又是如何把我的胳膊，那颤抖着的胳膊，可以说是硬从自己身上扯开，抬起手来——这场搏斗虽只经历了可怕的几秒钟，但却像是永恒的——用手指去按你门铃的电钮，要是你知道了这一切，你就不会再笑了。那刺耳的铃声至今还在我的耳朵里回响，随之而来的是沉寂，之后——这时我的心脏停止了跳动，我全身的血液凝固了——我只是竖起耳朵听着，你是不是来开门。

但是你没有来。谁也没有来。那天下午你显然出去了，约翰可能是为你办事去了；于是我就蹒跚地——单调刺耳的门铃声还在我的耳边震响——回到我们满目凄凉、空空如也的屋子里，筋疲力尽地一头倒在一条花呢旅行毯上，这四步路走得我疲乏之至，仿佛在深深的雪地里走了好几个小时似的，虽然疲惫不堪，可是他们把我拉走之前我要见到你、跟你说话的决心依然在燃烧，并未熄灭。我向你发誓，这里面并没有一丝情欲的念头，我当时还不懂，除了你之外，我什么都不想：我只想见到你，只还想见一次，紧紧地抱着你。于是整整一夜，这漫长的、可怕的整整一夜，亲爱的，我都在等待着你。母亲刚一上床睡着，我就蹑手蹑脚地溜到前屋里，侧耳倾听，你什么时候回家。整整一夜我都在等待着，而这可是一个冰冷的一月之夜啊！我疲惫不堪，四肢疼痛，想坐一坐，可是屋里连张椅子都没有了，于是我就平躺在冷冰冰的地板上，从房门底下的缝隙里嗖嗖地吹进股股寒风。我的衣服穿得很单薄，又没有拿毯子，躺在冰冷的地板上，浑身骨节眼里都感到刺痛；我倒是不想要暖和，生怕一暖和就会睡着，就听不到你的脚步声了。这是很难受的，我的两只脚痉挛了，紧紧蜷缩在一起，我的胳膊颤抖着：我只好一次又一次地站起来，在这漆黑的夜里，可真把人冻死了。但是我等待着，等待着，等待着你，宛如等待着我的命运。

终于——大概已经是凌晨两三点钟了吧——我听见下面开大门的声音，接着就有上楼梯的脚步声。顿时我身上的寒意全然消失，一股热流在我心头激荡，我轻轻地开了房门，准备冲到你面前，伏在你的脚下……啊，我真不知道，我这个傻姑娘当时会干出什么事来。脚步声越来越近。烛光忽闪忽闪地照到了楼上。我抖抖索索地握着房门的把手。来的人果真是你吗？

是，是你，亲爱的——但你不是独自一人。我听到一阵挑逗性的轻笑，绸衣服拖在地上发出的窸窣声和你低声细语的说话声——你是带了一个女人回家来的……

我不知道，我是如何挨过这一夜的。第二天早晨八点钟，他们就把我拖往因斯布鲁克；我已经没有一丝力气来反抗了。





我的孩子已在昨天夜里去世了——如果我当真还要继续活下去的话，那我又将是孤苦伶仃的一个人了。明天要来人了，那些陌生的、黑炭似的大个儿笨汉子，他们将抬一口棺材来，收殓我那可怜的、我那唯一的孩子。也许朋友们也会来，送来花圈，但是鲜花放在棺材上又顶什么用？他们会来安慰我，对我说几句，说几句话；但是他们又能帮得了我些什么呢？我知道，这以后我又是孤零零一个人了。再也没有什么东西比在人群之中感到孤独更可怕的了。这一点我那时就体会到了，在因斯布鲁克度过的没有尽头的两年岁月里，即从我十六岁到十八岁的时候，像个囚犯，像个被摈弃的人似的生活在家里的两年时间里，就体会到了这一点。继父是个生性平和、寡言少语的人，对我很好；我母亲好像为了弥补她无意之中所犯的过失，所以对我的一切要求总是全部给予满足，年轻人围着我献殷勤，但是我都斩钉截铁地对他们一概加以拒绝。不和你在一起，我就不想幸福地、惬意地生活，我把自己埋进一个晦暗的、寂寞的世界里，自己折磨自己。他们给我买的新花衣服我不穿，我不肯去听音乐会，不肯去看戏，或者跟大家一起兴高采烈地去郊游。我几乎连胡同都不出：你会相信吗，亲爱的，我在这座小城里住了两年，认识的街道还不上十条？我悲伤，我要悲伤，看不见你，我就强迫自己过着清淡的生活，并且还以此为乐。再有，我怀着一股热情，只希望生活在你的心里，我不愿让别的事情来转移这种热情。我独自一人坐在家里，一坐就是几小时，就是一整天，什么也不做，只是想着你，一次一次地、反反复复地重温对你的数百件细小的回忆，每次见你啦，每次等你啦，就像在剧院里似的，让这些细小的插曲一幕幕从我的心里闪过。因为我把往日的每一秒钟都回味了无数次，因此我的整个童年时期还都历历在目，那些逝去的岁月的每一分钟我都感到如此灼热和新鲜，仿佛是昨天在我身上发生的事。

那时我的整个身心全都用在了你的身上。你写的书我全都买了；要是报上登有你的名字，那这天就像节日一样。你相信吗，你的书里每一行我都能背下来，我一遍又一遍地把你的书读得滚瓜烂熟。要是有人半夜里把我从睡梦中叫醒，从你的书里抽出一行来念给我听，今天，隔了十三年，今天我还能接着念下去，就像在梦里一样：你的每一句话，对我来说都是福音书和祷告文。整个世界，只是和你有关，它才存在；我在维也纳的报纸上翻阅音乐会和首演的广告，心里只有一个想法，那就是哪些演出会使你感兴趣；一到黄昏，我就在远方陪伴着你：现在他进了剧场大厅，现在他坐下来了。这事我梦见过千百次，因为我曾经有一次，唯一的一次，在一次音乐会上见过你。

可是我说这些干什么呢，说一个被遗弃的孩子的这些疯狂的、自己糟蹋自己的，这些如此悲惨、如此绝望的狂热干什么呢？把这些告诉一个对此一无所感、毫无所知的人干什么呢？那时我确实不还是个孩子吗？我长到十七岁，十八岁了——年轻人开始在街上转过头来看我了，可是他们只能使我火冒三丈。因为想着和别人，而不是和你谈恋爱，即使只是拿恋爱开个玩笑，我也觉得简直是闻所未闻、难以理解的，在我看来，受勾引本身就已经犯了罪。我对你的激情始终犹如当年，只是随着我身体的发育和性欲的萌发而变得更加炽烈、更加肉感、更加女性罢了。当时在那个女孩子，那个去按你的门铃的女孩子的朦胧无知的意识中没能预感到的东西，现在成了我的唯一的思想：把自己献给你，完全委身于你。

我周围的人认为我腼腆，都说我怕羞（我紧咬牙关，关于我的秘密，一个字也不露出来）。但是在我心里却滋长了钢铁般的意志。我的全部心思都集中在一点上：回到维也纳，回到你的身边去。我费了好大的劲，终于实现了自己的愿望，在别人看来，我的这个愿望也许是荒谬的，不可理解的。我的继父颇有资财，他把我当作他的亲生女。我直闹着要自己挣钱来养活自己，后来终于达到了这个目的。我来到维也纳的一个亲戚家，在一家服装店里当职员。

在一个雾蒙蒙的秋日，我终于，终于来到了维也纳！难道还要我告诉你，我到维也纳以后第一程路是往哪儿去的吗？我把箱子存放在火车站，跳上一辆电车——我觉得电车开得多慢呀，每停一站都使我感到恼火——一直奔到那座楼房前面。你的窗户亮着灯，我的整个心灵发出了动听的声音。这座城市，这座曾经如此陌生、如此毫无意义地在我四周喧嚣嘈杂的城市，现在才有了生气，我现在才重新复活，因为我感觉到你就在近旁，你，我那永恒的梦。我并没有感觉到，无论隔着多少峡谷，高山，河流，或是在你和我闪着喜悦光芒的目光之间只隔着一层透明的薄玻璃，我对于你的意识来说，实际上都是一样遥远的。我抬头仰望，仰望：这儿有灯光，这儿是楼房，你就在这儿，这儿就是我的世界。对于这一时刻，我已经做了两年的梦了，现在总算赐给了我，这个漫长的、柔和的、云遮雾漫的夜晚，我在你的窗前站了很久，直到你房里的灯熄灭以后，我才去寻找我的住处。

这以后，我每天晚上都这样站在你的房前。我在店里干活一直干到六点钟才结束，活计很重，很累，但我很喜欢，因为工作很杂乱，我对自己内心的不宁也就不那么感到痛楚了。等到卷帘式铁百叶窗在我身后哐当一声落了下来，我就直奔我心爱的目的地。只要看你一眼，只想碰见你一次，只想用我的目光远远地再次抚摸你的脸庞——这就是我唯一的心愿。大约一个星期之后，我终于遇见了你，而且恰恰在我没有预料到的那一瞬间：我正抬头朝你的窗户张望的时候，你横穿马路过来了。突然，我又变成了那个小姑娘，那个十三岁的小姑娘，我感到热血涌上我的面颊；违背我渴望看见你的眼睛的内心冲动，我下意识地低下了头，像是有人在追我似的，从你身边一溜烟似的跑了过去。后来我为自己这种女学生似的胆怯的逃遁而感到羞愧，因为现在我的目的是一清二楚的：我想遇见你，我在找你，过了那么多渴望的、难熬的岁月，我希望你能认出我来，希望你注意到我，希望你爱上我。

但是你好长时间都没有注意到我，虽然每天晚上，无论是纷飞的大雪，还是维也纳凛冽刺骨的寒风，我都站在你那条胡同里，我往往白等几小时，有时候等了半天以后，你终于在朋友的陪伴下从屋里走了出来，有两次我还看见你和女人在一起，当我看见一位陌生女人同你紧挽胳膊一起走的时候，我感觉到了自己的成人意识，我的心突然颤了一下，把我的灵魂也撕裂了，这时我感觉到对你有一种新的、异样的感情。我并没有吃惊，我在儿童时代就已经知道女人是陪伴你的常客，可是现在却使我突然感到有种肉体上的痛苦，我心里那根感情之弦绷得紧紧的，对你跟另一个女人的这种明显的、这种肉体上的亲昵感到非常敌视，同时自己也很想得到。我当时有种孩子气的自尊心，也许今天也还保留着，所以一整天没有到你的屋子跟前去：但是这个抗拒和愤恨的空虚的夜晚是多么可怕呀！第二天晚上，我又低声下气地站在你的房子跟前，等呀等，就像我的整个命运，都站在你那关闭的生活之前似的。

一天晚上，你终于注意到我了。我已经看见你远远地过来了，我就振作起自己的意志，别又躲开你。说也凑巧，有辆货车停在街上要卸货，因而把马路堵得很窄，你就只好紧挨着我的身边走过去。你那心不在焉的目光下意识地扫了我一眼，它刚遇到我全神贯注的目光，就立即变成了——回忆起心里的往事，使我猛然一惊！——你那种勾引女人的目光，变成了那温存的、既脉脉含情又撩人销魂的、那拥抱式的、盯住不放的目光，这目光从前曾把我这个小姑娘唤醒，使我第一次成了女人，成了正在恋爱的女人。有一两秒钟之久，你的目光就这样凝视着我的目光，而我的目光却不能，也不愿意离开你的目光——随后你就从我身边走了过去。我的心怦怦直跳；我下意识地放慢了脚步，出于一种无法抑制的好奇心，我转过头来，看见你停住了，正在回头看我。从你好奇地、饶有兴趣地注视着我的神态里，我立刻就知道：你没有认出我来。

你没有认出我来，那时候没有，永远，你永远也没有认出我来。亲爱的，我怎么来向你描述那一瞬间的失望呢——当时我是第一次遭受到没有被你认出来的命运啊，这种命运贯穿在我的一生中，并且还带着它离开人世；没有被你认出来，一直还没有被你认出来。我怎么来向你描述这种失望呢！因为你看，在因斯布鲁克的两年中，我时刻都想着你，什么也不做，只是想象我们在维也纳的第一次重逢，根据自己的情绪状态，做着最幸福的和最可怕的梦。如果可以这么说的话，一切我都在梦里想过了；在我心情阴郁的时候，我设想过，你会拒我于门外，你会鄙视我，因为我太卑微，太丑陋，太不顾羞耻。你各种各样的怨恨、冷酷、淡漠，这一切我在热烈的幻象中都经历过了——可是这一点，这最最可怕的一点，就是在我心情最阴郁、自卑感最严重的时候，也没有敢去考虑过：你根本丝毫没有注意到我的存在。今天我懂得了——啊，那是你教我懂得的！——少女和女人的脸在男人眼里一定是变化无常的，因为脸通常只是一面镜子，时而是热情的镜子，时而是天真烂漫的镜子，时而又是疲惫的镜子，镜子中的形象极易流逝，所以一个男人也就更加容易忘记一个女人的容貌，因为年龄就在这面镜子里带着光和影逐渐流逝，因为服装会把一个女人的脸一下打扮成这样，等会儿又变成那样。那些听天由命的人，她们才是真正的智者。可是当时我这个少女，我对你的健忘还不能理解，因为由于我自己毫无节制、时刻不停地想着你，所以就产生了一种幻景，以为你也一定常常想着我，在等着我；如果我知道，你的心里并没有我，压根儿连想都没有想过我，那我活着还有什么意思！你的目光使我清醒了，你的目光表示，你一点也不认识我了，关于你的生活和我的生活之间，你竟连一根蛛丝那样的些微记忆也没有了。面对这样的目光，我如梦初醒，第一次跌到了现实之中，第一次预感到了自己的命运。

你那时没有认出我来。两天以后我们又再次相遇，你的目光带着点亲昵的神情周身打量着我，这时你依旧没有认出我就是曾经爱过你的、是被你唤醒的那个姑娘，你只认出我是那个漂亮的、十八岁的姑娘，两天以前曾在同一地点同你迎面相逢。你亲切而惊讶地看着我，嘴角挂着一丝轻柔的微笑。你又从我的身边走过去，马上又放慢了脚步；我颤抖，我狂喜，我祈祷，但愿你来跟我打招呼。我感到，我第一次为你而充满了活力；我也放慢了脚步，没有躲开你。突然，我没有回头便感觉到你在我的身后，我知道，这回我可以第一次听到你对我说话的可爱的声音了。这种期待的心情几乎使我软瘫了，我担心自己可能不得不停下来，心里像有十五个吊桶，七上八下——这时你走到我旁边来了。你用你特有的那种轻松愉快的神情跟我攀谈，仿佛我们是早就认识的老朋友了——啊，你没有感觉出我这个人，你也从来没有感觉出我的生活！——你跟我说话的神态是那么富有魅力，那么泰然自若，甚至我也能够跟你答话了。我们一起走了一条胡同，这时你问我，是否愿意一起去吃饭。我说：“行。”我怎敢拒绝你呢？

我们一起在一家小饭馆里吃饭——你还记得这家饭馆在哪里吗？啊，不，你一定跟其他这样的晚餐分不清了，因为在你心目中，我算得了什么？只不过是数万个女人中的一个，许许多多不胜枚举的风流艳遇中的一桩罢了。你有什么好想起我来的：我说得很少，因为在你身边，听你跟我说话，我就感到无限幸福了。我不愿意由于一个问题，一句愚蠢的话而白白浪费一秒钟。我永远不会忘记感谢你的这个时刻，你的心里满满地盛着我的热情的崇敬，你的举止如此温存风雅，轻松愉快，识体知礼，毫无迫不及待的妄为，没有匆忙的谄媚讨好的表示，从第一个瞬间起，就亲切自重，如逢知己，我早就把自己的整个身心都献给你了，即便未下这个决心，但单凭你此刻的举止也会赢得我的心的。啊，你可不知道，我傻乎乎地等了你五年，你没有使我失望，你简直使我高兴得忘乎所以了！

天已经很晚了，我们起身离去。走到饭馆门口，你问我是否忙着回家，是否还有点时间。我怎么能瞒着你，怎么能不告诉你我乐意听从你的意愿呢！我说，我还有时间。随后，你稍稍迟疑了一下，就问，我是否愿意上你那里去聊一会儿。“好啊！”我自然而然地脱口而出，随后我立即发现，你对我如此迅速的允诺，感到有点儿难堪或者高兴，反正显然感到十分意外。今天我明白了你的这种惊异；我知道，一个女人，即使她心里火烧火燎的，想委身于人，但是她们通常总要否认自己有这种打算，还要装出一副惊恐万状或者怒不可遏的样子，非等男人再三恳求，说一通弥天大谎，赌咒发誓和做出种种许诺，这才愿意平息下来。我知道，也许只有那些吃爱情饭的妓女，或是幼稚天真、年未及笄的小姑娘才会兴高采烈地满口答应那样的邀请。但是在我心里，这件事只不过是——你怎么能料想得到呢——化成了语言的心愿，千百个白天黑夜所凝聚，而现在突然迸发的相思而已。总之，当时你很吃一惊，我开始使你对我发生兴趣了。我觉察到，我们一起走的时候，你一边说着话，一边带着某种惊异的神情从侧面打量着我。你的感觉，你那对于一切人性的东西具有魔术般的十拿九稳的感觉，在这里你立即在这位漂亮的、柔顺的姑娘身上嗅出了一种不同寻常的东西，嗅出了一个秘密。于是，你好奇心大发，我觉察到，你想从一连串拐弯抹角的、试探性的问题着手，来摸清这个秘密。可是我避开了你：我宁可显得傻里傻气的样子，也不愿对你泄露我的秘密。

我们上楼到你屋里。请原谅，亲爱的，要是我对你说，你不可能明白，这楼道，这楼梯对我来说意味着什么，当时我的心里充满了何等样的陶醉，何等样的迷乱，何等样的疯狂、痛苦，几乎是致命的幸福啊！我现在想起这些，还不禁泪湿衣襟，然而我已经没有眼泪了。你想一想吧，那里每一件东西都好像渗透了我的激情，每一样东西都是我童年时代、是我的憧憬的象征：那大门，我在前面等过你千百次的大门；那楼梯，我在那里倾听你的脚步声，并在那儿第一次看见你的楼梯；那窥视孔，通过这个小孔我看得神魂颠倒；你房门口铺的小地毯，有次我曾在上面跪过；那钥匙的响声，每回一听到这声音，我总是从我潜伏的地方猛地一跃而起。我的整个童年，我的全部激情都寄托在这几米大的空间里了，我的生命就在这里，而现在命运像暴风雨似的降落到我的头上来了，因为一切，一切都如愿以偿了，我和你在一起走，我和你在你的在我们的房子里走着。你想想吧——这话听起来毫无意思，可我不知道怎么用别的话来说——一直到你房门口为止，一切都是现实，都是一辈子沉闷的、日常的世界，从那儿起，孩子的仙境，阿拉丁[1]的王国就开始了；你想一想，这房门我曾急不可待地盯过千百回，如今我飘飘然地走了进去，你将会预料到——但仅仅是预料到，永远也不会完全知道，我亲爱的！——这转瞬即逝的一分钟从我的生活里带走了什么。

那个晚上，我在你身边整整待了一夜。你可没有想到，在这以前还从来没有一个男人触摸过我，没有一个男人紧贴着或者看见过我的身子哩。但是亲爱的，你又怎么会想到呢，因为我对你毫没反抗，我压制了因羞怯而产生的忸怩，只是为了使你无法猜到我对你的爱情的秘密，要是你猜了出来，准会把你吓一大跳的——因为你喜欢的只是轻松自在，嬉戏玩耍，怡然自得，你生怕干预别人的命运。你喜欢对所有的女人，像蜜蜂采花似的对世界滥施爱情，而不愿做出任何牺牲。假如我现在对你说，亲爱的，我对你委身的时候还是个处女，那么我求求你：不要误解我！我不埋怨你，你并没有引诱我，欺骗我，勾引我——是我，是我自己硬凑到你跟前、投入你的怀抱、栽进自己的命运中去的。我永远，永远不会埋怨你，不，我只有永远感谢你，因为对我来说那一夜是至极的欢乐，闪光的喜悦，飘飘欲仙的幸福。那天夜里我一睁开眼，感到你在我的身边，总是感到奇怪，星星怎么没有在我头上闪烁，因为我真觉得自己到了天上了——不，我从来没有后悔，我亲爱的，从来没有因为那一刻而后悔。我还记得：你睡着了，我听见你的呼吸，贴着你的身子，感到自己挨你那么近，在黑暗中我流出了幸福的泪水。

第二天一大早我就急着要走。我得到店里去，也想在仆人来到之前就走，可不能让他看见。当我穿好衣服站在你面前，你把我搂在怀里，久久端视着我；莫非在你心里激荡着某个模糊而遥远的回忆，或者你只是觉得我当时神采飞扬，容貌美丽呢？然后你在我嘴上吻了一下。我轻轻从你手里挣脱，想走掉。这时你问我：“你带几朵花去，好吗？”我说好吧。你就在书桌上的蓝水晶花瓶里（啊，这只花瓶我是认识的，小时候我曾偷看过一眼）取出四朵洁白的玫瑰给了我。连着几天我还不住地吻着这几朵玫瑰哩。

我们事前约好在另一个晚上见面。我去了，那晚又是那么美妙。你还赐给了我第三夜。后来你就对我说，你要出门了——噢，我从小就恨你的这种旅行！——你答应我，一回来就立即通知我。我给了你一个邮局待取的地址——我不愿把我的姓名告诉你。我保守着自己的秘密。你又给了我几朵玫瑰作为临别纪念——作为临别纪念。

这两个月里我每天都去问……唉，算了，向你描述这种期待和绝望的极度痛苦干什么呢！我不埋怨你，我爱你，爱的就是这个你：感情炽烈，生性健忘，一见倾心，爱不忠诚。我爱你这个人就是这个样，只是这个样，你过去一直是这个样，现在还是这个样。你早就回来了，从你亮着灯的窗户我断定你回来了，你没有给我写信。在我生命的最后时刻，我也没有收到你的一行字，你的一行字，而我却把自己的生命都给了你。我等着，绝望地等着。你没有叫我，没有给我写一行字……没有写一行字……





我的孩子昨天死了——他也是你的孩子呀。他也是你的孩子，亲爱的，这是那如胶似漆的三夜所凝结的孩子，这一点我向你发誓，人之将死，其言也真，我快踏上黄泉路了，是不会撒谎的。这是我们的孩子，我向你发誓，因为从我委身于你的那一刻起，到这孩子从我肚子里生出来这一段时间里，没有任何男人接触过我的身子。我的身子任你紧紧贴过之后，我就有了一种神圣的感觉：我怎么能把自己既给你，又给别人呢？你是我的一切，而别人只不过是从我生命边上轻轻擦过的路人。他是我们的孩子，亲爱的，是我那专一不二的爱情和你那漫不经心的、毫不在乎的、几乎是无意识的柔情蜜意所凝成的孩子，他是我俩的孩子，我俩的儿子，我俩唯一的孩子。那么你一定要问——也许吓一大跳，也许只是不胜惊愕——那么你一定要问，我的亲爱的，问我在这么多年的漫长岁月里，为什么不把这个孩子告诉你，一直到今天他躺在这里，躺在这里的黑暗里的时候才谈到他，而此刻他已准备去了，永远不再回来了，永远不再回来了！可是我又怎么能告诉你关于孩子的事呢！我这个与你素昧平生的女人，我这个心甘情愿地跟你过了销魂荡魄的三夜，而且毫无反抗地、甚至是渴求地向你敞开了自己心怀的陌生女人，对她你是永远也不会相信的，你永远不会相信，她这么个跟你短暂萍水相逢的无名女人，会对你这个不忠诚的男人忠贞不渝，你永远也不会毫无疑虑地承认这孩子是你的亲生骨肉！即使你觉得我的话满有道理，真假难分，你也不可能消除这种暗暗的怀疑：我很富有，为此你企图把你在另一次风流欢会时种下的这个孩子硬塞给我。这样你就会对我猜疑，在你和我之间就会产生一片阴影，一片飘浮不定、腼腆的怀疑的阴影。这我不愿意。再说，我了解你，非常了解你，比你对自己还了解得清楚，我知道，你这个人只喜欢爱情中无忧无虑，轻松自在，游戏玩耍，要是突然间成了父亲，突然间要对一个命运负责，那你一定会感到难堪而棘手的。你一定会觉得，好像我把你拴住了，而你这个人是只有在自由自在的情况下才能呼吸的。因为我把你拴住了，你一定会因此而恨我的——不错，我知道，你会违背你自己清醒的意志而恨我的。也许只有几小时，也许只有短短的几分钟，你会觉得我是个累赘，会恨我——但是我要保持我的自尊心，我要让你这一辈子想起我的时候没有一丝忧虑。我宁可独自承担一切，也不愿让你背上个包袱，我要使自己成为你所钟情过的女人中的独一无二的一个，让你永远怀着爱情和感激来思念她。可是当然，你从来也没有思念过我，你已经把我忘在九霄云外了。

我不埋怨你，我的亲爱的，不，我不埋怨你。如果我的笔下偶尔流露出几滴苦痛的话，那就请你原谅我，请你原谅我——我的孩子——我们的孩子死了，就躺在这里影影绰绰的烛光下；我冲上帝攥紧拳头，管他叫凶手，我的心绪阴郁，神志紊乱。请原谅我倾吐我的哀怨，原谅我吧！我知道，你是善良的，内心深处是乐于助人的，你帮助每一个人，就是素昧平生的人有求于你，你也给予帮助。你的恩惠非常奇特，它对每个人都是敞开的，因此谁都可以自取，两只手能抓多少就取多少，你的恩惠是博大的，是博大无际的，你的恩惠，但是，它是——请原谅我——懒散的。你的恩惠要人家提醒，要人自己去拿。你帮助人要人家叫你，求你，你帮助人是出于害羞，出于软弱，而不是出于快乐。容我坦率地对你说吧，你可以和别人共幸福，而不愿和人共患难。像你这样的人，即使是其中最有良心的人，求他也是很难的。有一次，那时我还是孩子，我从门上的窥视孔里看见有个乞丐按响了你的门铃，你给了他一点钱。还没等他开口向你要，你就迅速给了他，甚至给得很不少，可是你给他的时候心里有点害怕，是慌慌张张递给他的，好把他立即打发走，仿佛你怕看他的眼睛似的。你帮助人家的时候那种忐忑不安、羞羞答答、怕人感激的神态，我永远忘不了。因此我从来也不来求你。当然，我知道，那时即使你还拿不稳这是你的孩子，你也会帮助我的，你也一定会安慰我，给我钱，给我一笔数目相当可观的钱，可是你心里却总悄悄怀着焦躁的情绪，要把这件煞风景的事从你身上推得一干二净；是的，我相信，你甚至要说服我尽早把胎打掉。这是我顶顶害怕的事，因为你所希望的事，我怎么会不去做呢，我又怎么能拒绝你的要求呢！可是这孩子就是我的一切，他也确实是你的，他就是你，但已经不再是那个我无法驾驭的、幸福无忧的你了，而是那个永远——我这样认为——给了我的、禁锢在我的身体里、连着我生命的你了。现在我终于把你捉住了，我可以在自己的血管里感到你在生长，感到你的生命在生长，只要我心里忍不住了，我就可以用食品喂你，用乳汁哺你，可以轻轻抚摸你，温柔地吻你。你瞧，亲爱的，因此当我知道，我怀了你的孩子，我是多么幸福，因此我就没有把这事对你说：因为这样，你就再也不会从我身边逃走了。

当然，亲爱的，后来的生活也并不全是我原先所想的那种幸福的日子，也有的日子充满了恐惧和烦恼，充满了对人的卑鄙下流的憎恶。我的日子过得很艰难。为了不让我的亲戚发现我怀了孕，并把这事告诉我家里，因此临产前的几个月我不能再到店里去上班了。我不愿向我母亲要钱——我就把身边有的那点首饰卖掉，这样才勉强维持了分娩前那段时间的生活。分娩前一星期，一个洗衣女工从柜子里偷走了我剩下的最后几枚克朗，因此我只得进了一家妇产医院。只有那些身上分文不名的穷人，那些被抛弃、被遗忘的女人，在走投无路的时候才到那里去，置身于贫困的社会渣滓之中，这孩子，你的孩子，就是在那里呱呱坠地的。那儿真是叫人活不下去：陌生，陌生，一切都陌生，我们躺在那儿的人，互相也都是陌生的，大家寂寞孤独，彼此仇视，大家都是被贫困、被同样的痛苦踢进这间沉闷的、充满哥罗芳和血腥气的、充满叫喊和呻吟的产房里来的。穷人不得不忍受的轻薄，精神上和肉体上的羞辱，在那里我全受过了：我得跟那些娼妓、那些病人挤在一起，她们惯于对有同样命运的病人使坏；我忍受了年轻医生的玩世不恭的态度，他们脸上挂着一丝嘲讽的微笑，掀开我这个毫无反抗力的女人的被单，在身上摸来摸去，美其名曰检查；我忍受着女护理人员贪得无厌的私欲——啊，在那里，人的羞耻心被目光钉上了十字架，任凭语言的鞭笞。只有写着你的名字的那块牌子，在那里只有这块东西还是你自己，因为那床上躺着的，只不过是一块抽搐着的、任凭好奇的人东捏西摸的肉，只不过是一个供观赏和研究的对象而已——啊，那些妇女，那些在自己家里为守候着她们的温存爱抚的丈夫生孩子的妇女，她们不懂得举目无亲、不能防卫、像在实验桌上似的把孩子生下来是个什么滋味！要是我今天在哪本书里看到“地狱”这个词，我就仍然会不由自主地突然想到那间塞得满满的、水汽腾腾的，充满了呻吟、狂笑和惨叫的产房，那间宰割羞耻心的屠场，我就是在那儿遭的罪。

请原谅，请原谅我说了这些事。可是我就谈这一次，以后永远、永远不再说了。这些事十一年来我一句也没说过，不久我就将闭口不语，直到无垠的永恒，但是我得叫喊一次，嚷一次：为了这个孩子，我付出了多少昂贵的代价啊！这孩子就是我的幸福，如今他躺在那里，已经停止了呼吸。我已经忘掉了那些时刻，在孩子的笑容和声音里，在他的幸福中早就把它们忘在九霄云外了；但是现在孩子死了，痛苦又潜入了我的心头，这一次，就这一次，我得把它从心里倾吐出来。但是我并不是埋怨你，我只是埋怨上帝，是他让这些痛苦到处狂奔乱闯的。我不埋怨你，我向你发誓；我从来没有对你发过脾气。即使我腹痛得蜷缩起来的时候，即使在大学生触触摸摸般的目光下我羞愧得无地自容的时候，即使在痛苦撕裂我的灵魂的时候，我都没有在上帝面前控告过你；对于那几夜，我从来都没有后悔过，从来没有责骂过我对你的爱情，我始终都爱着你，一直为你所给我的那个时刻而祝福。假如由于那些时刻我还得再进一次地狱，而且事先知道我将受的苦，那么我还愿意再进一次，我亲爱的，愿意再进一次，再进一千次！





我们的孩子昨天死了——你从来没有见过他。这个活泼可爱的小人儿，你的骨肉，从来没有，连偶然匆匆相遇也未曾有过，就是擦身走过时他也没有碰到过你的目光。有了这个孩子，我就躲了起来，不见你的面；我对你的相思也不那么痛苦了，自从赐给我这个孩子以后，我觉得我爱你爱得没有先前那么狂热了，至少不像先前那样受爱情的煎熬了。我不愿把自己分开来，分给你和他两个人，所以我就没有把自己的感情倾注给你，而是一股脑儿全部给了这个孩子，因为你是个幸运儿，你的生活和我不沾边，而这孩子却需要我，我得抚养他，我可以吻他，可以搂着他。看样子我从由于想你——我的厄运——而陷入的神思恍惚的状态中解救出来了，我是由于这个另外的你，真正属于我的这个你而得救的——只有在很少很少的时候，我的感情才会低三下四地再到你的房前去。我只做一件事：在你生日的时候，我每次都送你一束白玫瑰，和当年我们一起过了第一个恩爱之夜以后，你送给我的一模一样。这十来年当中，你心里是否问过自己，这些鲜花是谁送来的？也许你也想到过你从前送过她这样的玫瑰的那个女人？我不知道，我也不想知道你的回答。我只是暗中把玫瑰给你递过去。一年一次，为了唤醒你对那一时刻的回忆——对我来说，这已经足够了。

你从来没有见过他，没有见过我们可怜的孩子——今天我责备自己，我一直把他对你隐瞒了，因为你是会爱他的。你从来没有见过他，没有见过这个可怜的男孩，从来没有见过他的微笑，每当他轻轻抬起眼睑，然后用他那聪明的黑眼睛——你的眼睛！——向我，向全世界投来一道明亮而欢快的光芒的时候，你从来没有见过他的微笑！啊，他是多么快活，多么可爱呀。在他身上天真地再现了你的全部轻快的性格，在他身上重演了你那敏捷的、驰骋的想象力。他可以接连几小时沉迷在他的玩意儿里，就像你游戏人生一样，然后他就竖着眉毛，一本正经地坐着看书。他越来越像你了；你所特有的那种既有严肃又有戏谑的性格上的两重性，已经明显地在他身上滋长起来了，他越是像你，我就越发爱他。他学习成绩很好，说起法文来真像只小喜鹊，他的作业本是全班最干净的，再说他的模样多好看，穿身黑天鹅绒衣服或是穿件白海员衫是多么帅气。无论走到哪里，他都是最雅致漂亮的；在格拉多[2]海滨，我跟他一起散步的时候，女人们都停下来，抚摸他那金色的长发；在塞默林[3]，他滑雪橇的时候，大家都朝他转过头来啧啧称羡。他是这么漂亮，这么娇嫩，这么惹人爱，去年他进了特莱茜娅寄宿中学[4]，穿了制服，身佩短剑，活像个十八世纪的王室侍从——可是他现在除了身上的一件衬衫之外，别无他物了，这可怜的孩子，他躺在这里，嘴唇苍白，双手交叉叠在一起。

也许你要问我，我怎么能够让孩子在奢华的环境中受教育的呢，怎么能够让他享受到上流社会光明、快活的生活的呢？亲爱的，我在黑暗中跟你说话；我没有廉耻了，我要告诉你，但你别吓坏了，亲爱的——我卖淫了。我倒不是那种街头野鸡，不是娼妓，但是我卖淫了。我有很阔的朋友，很阔的情人，先是我去找他们的，后来他们就来找我了，因为我非常之美——不知你注意到没有？每一个我向他委身的男人都喜欢我，他们大家都感谢我，都依恋我，都爱我——只有你不是，只有你不是，我的亲爱的！

我对你吐露了我卖淫的真情，你会看不起我吗？不会，我知道，你不会看不起我，我知道，你理解这一切，你也将会理解，我只是为了你，为了你的另一个“我”，为了你的孩子才走这一步的。在妇产医院的那间病房里，我就曾经领略过穷困的可怕，我知道，在这个世界上，穷人总是被践踏、被凌辱的，总是牺牲品，我不愿意，无论如何都不愿意让你的孩子，让你的这个开朗、美丽的孩子在社会深深的底层，在小胡同的垃圾堆里，在霉气熏天、卑鄙下流的环境中，在一间陋室的污浊的空气中长大成人。不能让他稚嫩的小嘴去说些俚言俗语，不能让他那雪白的身体去穿霉气熏人的、皱皱巴巴的寒酸的衣裳——你的孩子应该享有一切，世上的一切财富，人间的一切快乐，他应该重新升到你的地位，升到你的生活范围里去。由于这个原因，只是因为这个原因，我的亲爱的，我卖淫了。对我来说，这不是什么牺牲，因为大家通常称为名誉、耻辱的东西，对我来说全是空的：你不爱我，而我的身子又只属于你一个人，既然这样，那么我的身子不管做出什么事来，我也觉得是无所谓的了。男人的爱抚，甚至于他们内心深处的激情，都不能丝毫打动我的心灵，虽然我对他们之中的有些人也很敬重，由于他们的爱情得不到回报而对他们深表同情，这使我想起自己的命运，而内心常常感到深受震动。我所认识的那些男人，他们大家都对我很好，大家都很宠爱我，尊敬我。尤其是有位年纪较大的、丧了妻的帝国伯爵，就是他为我四方奔走，八方说情，好让特莱茜娅中学录取这个没有父亲的孩子，你的孩子——他像爱女儿那么爱我。他向我求过三四次婚——要是我答应了这门亲事，今天就是伯爵夫人了，就是蒂罗尔[5]某座迷人的王宫的女主人了，我就可以过着无忧无虑的生活，因为孩子有了一个慈祥的父亲，把他当作宝贝，而我身边就有了个文静、显贵和善良的丈夫——我没有答应，无论他催得多么急迫、频繁，也不论我的拒绝是多么伤他的心。也许我做了件蠢事，因为要不现在我便在什么地方过着安静、悠闲的生活了，而把这孩子，这可爱的孩子，带在我的身边，但是——我干吗不向你承认呢？——我不愿自己为婚姻所羁绊，为了你，我任何时候都要使自己是自由的。在我内心深处，在我的潜意识里，我一直还在做着那个陈旧的孩子梦：也许你会再次把我召唤到你的身边，哪怕只叫我去一小时。为了这可能的一小时，我把一切都推开了，只是为你而保持自己的自由，一听召唤，就扑到你的怀里。自从童年时代之后青春萌发以来，我的整整一生不外乎就是等待，等待你的意志！

这个时刻果真来到了。可是你并不知道，你没有觉察到，我的亲爱的！就在那个时刻你也没有认出我——永远，永远，你永远没有认出我！以前我常常遇见你，在剧院里，在音乐会上，在普拉特公园里[6]，在大街上——每次我的心都猛地一抽，但是你的眼光只在我身边一晃而过；当然，外表上我已经完全变成另外一个人了，我从一个腼腆的小姑娘变成了一位妇人，如像他们所说的，长得漂亮，衣着十分名贵考究，身边围了一帮仰慕者；你怎么会想到，我就是在你卧室里昏暗的灯光下的那个羞答答的姑娘呢！有时候跟我一起走的先生中有一位向你打招呼；你向他答谢，并对我表示敬意；可是你的目光是客气而生疏的，是赞赏的，但从来没有认出我的神情。生疏，可怕的生疏。我还记得，有一次你那认不出我来的目光——虽然我对此几乎已经习以为常了——使我像被火灼了一样痛苦不堪：我跟一位朋友一起坐在歌剧院的一个包厢里，而隔壁的包厢里就是你。序曲开始的时候，灯光熄灭了，你的面容我看不到了，只感到你的呼吸挨我很近，就像当年那个夜晚那样近，你的手，你那纤细、娇嫩的手，支撑在我们这两个包厢的铺着天鹅绒的栏杆上。一种强烈的欲望不断向我袭来，我想俯下身去卑躬屈节地吻一吻这只陌生的、如此可爱的手，过去我曾经领受过这只手的温存多情的拥抱的呀！我耳边音乐声浪起伏越厉害，我的欲望也越狂热，我不得不攥紧拳头，使劲控制住自己，我不得不强打精神，正襟危坐，一股巨大的魔力把我的嘴唇往你那只可爱的手上吸引过去。第一幕一完，我就求我的朋友跟我一起走。在黑暗中你如此生疏，如此贴近地挨着我，我再也忍受不住了。

但是这时刻来到了，又一次来到了，最后一次闯进了我这无声无息的生活之中。那差不多是正好一年以前，你生日的第二天。奇怪，我时时刻刻都在想着你，你的生日我每年都是过节一样来庆祝的。一大早我就出门去买了那些年年都让人给你送去的白玫瑰，作为对那个你已经忘却了的时刻的纪念。下午我带着孩子一起乘车出去，把他带到戴默尔点心铺[7]，晚上带他去看戏。我想让他从少年时代起就感觉到，他也应该感觉到，这一天是个神秘的节日，虽然他对这个日子的意义并不了解。第二天我和我当时的朋友，布吕恩的一位年轻、有钱的工厂主待在一起。我已经和他同居两年了，我是他的掌上明珠，他娇我宠我，也同别人一样要跟我结婚，而我也像对别人一样，好像莫名其妙地拒绝了他，尽管他馈赠厚礼给我和孩子，尽管他本人有点儿呆板，有点儿谦卑的样子，但心地善良，人还是很可爱的。我们一起去听音乐会，在那里碰到一帮兴高采烈的朋友，随后大家便到环城马路的一家饭馆去共进晚餐，在欢声笑语之中，我提议再到塔巴林舞厅去跳舞。本来我对这种灯红酒绿、醉生梦死的舞厅，夜间东游西逛的行为一向都很反感，平素别人提议到那儿去，我总是竭力反对的，但是这一次——我心里像有一种莫名的神奇力量，使我突如其来地、本能地做出了这个提议，在在座的人当中引起一阵激动，大家都兴高采烈地表示赞同——我却突然产生了一个无法解释的愿望，仿佛那里有什么特别的东西在等着我似的。他们大家都习惯于迎合奉承我，便迅速站起身来。我们大家一起来到舞厅，喝着香槟酒，突然我心里产生了一种从未有过的疯狂的然而又差不多是痛苦的兴致。我喝酒，跟着唱一些拙劣的、多情善感的歌曲，心里产生了一种想要跳舞、想要欢呼的欲望，几乎无法把它摆脱开。可是突然——我觉得仿佛有种什么冷冷的或者灼热的东西猛地放到我的心上——我竭力振作精神，正襟危坐：你和几个朋友坐在邻桌，用欣赏的、露着色眯眯的目光看着我，用那种每每把我撩拨得心旌飘摇的目光看着我。十年来你第一次又以你气质中所具有的全部本能的、沸腾的激情盯着我。我颤抖了。我举着的酒杯差一点儿从手中掉落下来。幸好同桌的人都没有注意到我心慌意乱的神态，它在音乐和欢笑的喧嚣中消失了。

你的目光越来越灼人，使我浑身灼烫如焚。我不知道，你是到底，到底认出我来了呢，还是把我当作另外一个女人，一个陌生女人，想把我弄到手？热血涌上了我的双颊，我心不在焉地和同桌的人答着话：你一定注意到了，我被你的目光弄得多么心慌意乱。你脑袋一甩，向我示意，别人根本没有觉察到，你示意我到前厅去一会儿。接着你就十分张扬地去付账，告别了你的朋友，走了出去，临走前又再次向我暗示，你在外面等着我。我浑身直哆嗦，像是发冷，又像发烧，我答不出话来，也控制不住冲动起来的热血。在这一瞬间正好有一对黑人，用鞋后跟踩得啪啪直响，嘴里发出尖声怪叫，开始跳一个奇奇怪怪的新舞蹈：所有的眼睛都注视着他们，而我正好利用这一瞬间。我站起身来，对我的朋友说，我马上就回来，说着就跟着你出来了。

你站在外面前厅里的衣帽间前面等着我。我一来，你的目光就亮了起来。你微笑着快步朝我迎来；我马上看出，你没有认出我来，没有认出从前的那个孩子，没有认出那个少女来，你又一次把我当成一个新欢，当成一个素不相识的人，想把我弄到手。“您也给我一小时行吗？”你亲切地问道——你那副十拿九稳的样子使我感觉到，你把我当作做夜间生意的野鸡了。“行。”我说，这是同样的一个颤抖的，但却是不言而喻地表示同意的“行”字，十多年前在灯光昏暗的马路上那位少女曾经对你说过这个字。“那么我们什么时候可以见面？”你问道。“您什么时候愿意就什么时候见。”我回答说——在你面前我不感到羞耻。你略为有点惊讶地望着我，眼睛里带着和当年完全一样的那种狐疑、好奇的惊讶，那时我的十分迅速的允诺也曾同样使你感到惊异。“您现在行吗？”你略为有些迟疑地问道。“行，”我说，“我们走吧。”

我想到衣帽间去取我的大衣。

这时我想起，存衣单还在我朋友那里哩，因为我们的大衣是存放在一起的。转去问他要吧，没有一大堆理由是不行的，另一方面，要我放弃同你在一起的时刻，放弃这个多年来我朝思暮想的时刻，我又不愿意。于是，我一秒钟也没迟疑：我只拿条围巾披在晚礼服上，走到外面湿雾弥漫的夜色中去了，根本没去管那件大衣，也没有去理会那个情意绵绵的好人。多年来我是靠他生活的，而我却当着他朋友的面使他成了个可笑的傻瓜，出他的洋相：他结识多年的情妇，一个陌生男人冲她吹了个口哨，就跑掉了。啊，我内心深处意识到，我对一位诚实的朋友所做的事是多么低贱下流、忘恩负义、卑鄙无耻啊，我感到，我做的事很可笑，我以自己的疯狂行为使一个善良的人受到了永久的、致命的精神创伤，我感到，我把自己的生活从正中间撕成了两半——同我急于再一次吻你的嘴唇，再一次听你温柔地对我说话相比，友谊对我来说算得了什么，我的存在又算得了什么！我就是如此地爱你，现在一切都过去了，都消逝了，此刻我可以告诉你了，我相信，哪怕我已经死在床上，假如你呼唤我，我就会立即获得一种力量，站起身来，跟着你走。

门口停了一辆车，我们把车开到你的寓所。我又听到了你的声音，感到你情意绵绵地就在我的身边，我感到如此陶醉，如此孩子气的幸福，简直不知所措，和当年完全一样。事隔十多年以后，我第一次重又登上了这楼梯——不，不说了，我无法向你描述，在那些瞬间，我对一切总是有着双重的感觉，既感觉到流去的岁月，又感觉到现时的光阴，而在这一切之中，只感觉到你。你的房间里变化不大，多了几幅画，添了几本书，有几处地方添了几件以前没有见过的家具，不过我对一切都感到十分亲切。书桌上放着花瓶，瓶里插着玫瑰，插着我的玫瑰，这是前一天你过生日的时候我送你的，以纪念一个女人，对于她你已经记不起来，也认不出来了，即使现在她正在你的身边，手拉着手，嘴唇贴着嘴唇，你也认不出她了。不管怎么说，这些鲜花你供养着，这使我心里高兴：这样总还有我心底的一片情分，还有我的一缕呼吸萦绕着你。

你把我搂在你的怀里。我又在你那里过了一个风流夜晚。不过我赤裸着身子的时候，你也没有认出我来。我幸福地承受着你娴熟的温存和情意，并且看到，你的激情对一个情人和一个妓女是没有区别的，你纵情恣欲，毫不在乎消耗掉自己大量元气。你对我这个从夜总会叫来的女人是如此温柔，如此多情，如此风雅和如此亲切敬重，而同时在消受女人的时候又是如此激情奔放；我陶醉在往日的幸福之中，我又感觉到了你这种独一无二的心灵上的两重性，在肉欲的激情之中含着意识的，亦即精神的激情，这种激情当年就已经使我这个女孩子对你俯首听命，难舍难分了。我从来没有见过一个男人在柔情蜜意之中，在那片刻之际是如此不要命，如此一览无遗地暴露自己的灵魂——当然，时过境迁，此事也就被无情无义地掷进无边无际的遗忘的汪洋大海里去了。不过我自己也忘了自己：此时在黑暗中挨着你的我到底是谁？我就是往昔那个感情炽烈的姑娘吗，就是你的孩子的母亲，就是这个陌生女人吗？啊，在这个销魂之夜，这一切是多么亲切，多么熟悉，又是多么新鲜。我祈祷，但愿这一夜永无尽头。

但是黎明来临了，我们起得很迟，你请我跟你一起去吃早餐。侍者老早就谨慎地摆好了茶，我们一起喝着，聊着。你又用那种非常坦率、亲切的知心人的态度跟我说话，又是不谈任何不得体的问题，对我这个人的情况一句也不打听。你没有问我的姓名，没有问我的住处；对你来说，这只不过又是春风一度，是件无名的东西，是一刻火热的时光在忘却的烟雾中消散得无影无踪。你说，你现在要出远门了，要到北非去两三个月；我在幸福之中颤抖起来了，因为这时我的耳边响起了一个声音：完了，完了，已经忘了！我真恨不得扑到你的膝下，大声呼喊：“带着我去，你终究会认出我来的，终究，终究，过了多年之后，你终究会认出我来的！”但是在你面前我是如此腼腆，如此胆怯，如此奴性十足，如此软弱。我只能说：“多遗憾啊。”你笑嘻嘻地看着我，说：“你真觉得遗憾吗？”

这时我野性突发。我站起来，盯着你，长时间地、紧紧地盯着你。接着我说：“我过去爱过一个人，他也老是出门旅行。”我盯着你，目光直刺你眼睛里的瞳仁。“现在，现在他会认出我来了！”我浑身战栗，心都快要跳出来了。可是你却对我微笑着，安慰我说：“会回来的。”“是的，”我回答说，“会回来的，不过到那时也就忘掉了。”

我跟你说话的样子，一定有点特别，一定很有激情。因为你站了起来，凝视着我，十分诧异，充满爱怜。你抓着我的肩膀。“美好的东西是忘不了的，我永远也忘不了你。”你说，同时低下头来，目光直射进我的心里，仿佛要把我的形象深深印在你的脑海里似的。我感到这目光透进了我的心灵，在探索、追踪，在吮吸我的整个生命，这时我以为，盲人终于、终于复明了。他要认出我了，他要认出我了！我的整个灵魂都沉浸在这个想法之中，颤抖了。

可是你并没有认出我。没有，你没有认出我，在你的心目中，我此刻比已往任何时候都更为陌生，因为否则——否则你就绝对不可能干出你几分钟以后所干的事来。你吻了我，又一次热烈地吻了我。我的头发乱了，我得把它重新整理好，我站在镜子前面，这时我从镜子里看到——我羞惊难言，几乎摔倒在地——我看到，你正小心翼翼地把几张大面值钞票塞进我的暖手筒里去。这一瞬间，我怎么会没有叫起来，没有给你一记耳光呢！——我，我从童年时代起就爱你了，我是你的孩子的母亲，而你却付给我钱，为了这一夜！在你的心目中我是一个塔巴林的妓女，只不过如此而已——你就付钱给我！被你忘了，这还不够，我还得受凌辱！

我迅速收拾我的东西。我要离去，马上离去。我的心都碎了。我伸手去拿我的帽子，帽子就搁在书桌上那只插着白玫瑰、插着我的白玫瑰的花瓶旁边。这时我心里又产生了一个强烈的、不可抗拒的希望：我要再来试一试，提醒你想起往事。“你愿意给我一朵你的那些白玫瑰吗？”“好啊。”说着，你立即取了一朵。“可是这些玫瑰也许是一个女人，一个爱你的女人给你的吧？”我说。“也许是，”你说，“我不知道。花是别人送的，我不知道是谁送的；正因为这样，我才如此喜欢这些花。”我凝视着你。“说不定也是一个已经被你忘却的女人送的呢！”

你不胜惊讶地望着。我死死地盯着你。“认出我吧，最后认出我来吧！”我的目光在呼喊。但是你的眼睛亲切地、莫名其妙地微笑着。你再一次吻我。可是你并没有认出我来。

我快步走到门口，因为我感觉到眼泪要涌出来了，可不能让你看见。我急忙奔了出去，跑得太急，在前屋差点儿同你的仆人约翰撞个满怀。他怯生生地忙不迭闪到一边，打开房门让我出去，就在这时——就在这一秒钟，你听见了吗？就在我眼噙泪水看着他、看着这位面容衰老的仆人的一秒钟，他的眼里突然一亮。在这一秒钟，你听见了吗？在这一秒钟，这位从我童年时代过后就一直没有见过我的老人认出了我。为了这个，我真要跪倒在他面前，吻他的手。我迅速从暖手筒里把钞票，把你用来鞭笞我的钞票扯出来，塞给了他。他哆嗦着，不胜惊讶地注视着我——在这一瞬间他比你在一生中对我的了解还多。所有的人都很娇惯我，大家都对我很好——只有你，只有你，只有你把我忘掉了，只有你，只有你从来没有认出我！





我的孩子死去了，我们的孩子——现在这个世界上，我除你之外再没有一个好爱的人了。但是对我来说你又是谁？你，你从来都没有认出我，你从我身边走过像是从一条河边走过，你踩在我身上如同踩着一块石头，你总是走啊，不停地走，却让我在等待中消磨一生。我曾经以为在这孩子身上可把你这个逃亡者抓住了。但是这毕竟是你的孩子：一夜之间他就残酷地离开我旅行去了，他把我忘掉了，永远不回来了。我又是孤单单的一个人了，比以往任何时候还孤单，我什么都没有，你的东西什么都没有了——再没有孩子了，没有一句话，没有一行字，没有一点回忆，假若有人在你面前提起我的名字，对你来说是生疏的，你也就这只耳朵进，那只耳朵出。我为什么不乐意死去，因为对你来说我已经死了？我为什么不走开，因为你已经离开了我？不，亲爱的，我不是埋怨你，我不愿把我的哀愁掷进你快乐的屋子里去。请不用担心我会继续来逼你——请原谅我，此刻孩子已经死了，孤零零地躺在那里，此刻我得让我的灵魂呼喊一次。只有这一次我必须得跟你说——说完我就默默地重新回到我的晦暗中去，就像我一直默默地在你身边一样。但是只要我活着，你就不会听到我这呼喊——只有我死了，你才会收到一个女人的这份遗嘱，这个女人她生前爱你胜过所有的人，而你始终没有认出她，她曾经一直等你的，而你从来没有召唤过她。也许，也许将来你会召唤我，而我将第一次没有忠实于你，那是因为我死了，再也不会听到你的召唤了：我没有留给你一张照片，没有留给你一件信物，就像你什么也没有留给我一样；你永远，永远也不会认出我了。我活着命运如此，死后命运也依然如此。在我生命的最后一刻，我不想叫你了，我去了，你连我的名字、我的面容都不知道。我死得很轻松，因为你在远处是不会感觉到的。倘若我的死会使你感到痛苦，那我就不会死了。

我写不下去了……我的脑袋里在嗡嗡直响……我四肢疼痛，我在发烧……我想，我得马上躺下。也许很快就过去了，也许命运会对我大发慈悲，我不必看着他们把孩子抬走……我写不下去了。永别了，亲爱的，永别了，我感谢你……不管怎么，事情这样还是好的……我要感谢你，直到我最后一口气。我感到很痛快：我把一切全对你讲了，现在你就知道，不，你只会感觉到，我曾经多么爱你，而你在这份爱情上却没有一丝累赘。我不会让你痛苦地怀念的——这使我感到安慰。在你美好、光明的生活里不会发生些微变化……我并不拿我的死来做任何有损于你的事……这使我感到安慰，你，我的亲爱的。

可是谁……现在谁会在你的生日老送你白玫瑰呢？啊，花瓶也将是空的了，我的一缕呼吸，我的心底的一片情分，往昔一年一度萦绕在你的身边，从此也即烟消云散了！亲爱的，听着，我求你……这是我对你的第一个，也是最后一个请求……请你做件让我高兴的事，你每逢生日——生日是一个想起自己的日子——都买些玫瑰来供在花瓶里。请你这样做，亲爱的，请你这样做吧，像别人一年一度为亲爱的亡灵做次弥撒一样。我可不再相信上帝了，所以不要别人给我做弥撒，我只相信你，我只爱你，我只想继续活在你的心里……啊，一年只要一天，悄悄地、悄悄地继续活在你的心里，就像过去我曾经活在你身边一样……我求你这样去做，亲爱的，这是我对你的第一个请求，也是最后一个……我感谢你……我爱你，我爱你……永别了……





他从颤抖着的手里把信放下，然后就久久地沉思。某种回忆浮现在他的心头，他想起了一个邻居的小孩，想起一位姑娘，想起夜总会的一个女人，但是这些回忆模模糊糊，朦胧不清，宛如一块石头，在流水底下闪烁不定，飘忽无形。影子涌过来，退出去，可是总构不成画面。他感觉到了一些藕断丝连的感情，却又想不起来。他觉得，所有这些形象仿佛都梦见过，常常在深沉的梦里见到过，然而仅仅是梦见而已。

他的目光落到了他面前书桌上的那只蓝花瓶上。花瓶是空的，多年来在他过生日的时候第一次是空的。他全身觳觫一怔：他觉得，仿佛一扇看不见的门突然打开了，股股穿堂冷风从另一世界嗖嗖吹进他安静的屋子。他感觉到一次死亡，感觉到不朽的爱情：一时间他的心里百感交集，他思念起那个看不见的女人，没有实体，充满激情，犹如远方的音乐。

月光巷


韩耀成　译

轮船为风暴所耽搁，很晚才在法国海港小城靠岸，因而未赶上开往德国的夜班火车。这样，未曾想到，竟在这个陌生的地方待了一天，晚上，除了在市郊一家娱乐中心听听女子乐队演奏的忧伤音乐或同几位萍水相逢的旅伴乏味地闲聊一阵之外，就别无其他有吸引力的活动了。旅店的小餐厅里烟雾弥漫，连空气都是油腻腻的，真让人难以忍受，何况纯净的海风在我唇上留下的一抹咸丝丝的清凉尚未消退，所以我更是倍感这里空气之污浊。于是我便走出旅店，沿着灯光明亮的宽阔的大街，信步走向有国民自卫军在演奏的广场，重新置身于懒洋洋地向前涌动的散步者的浪涛之中。起初，我觉得在这些对周围漠不关心、衣着外省色彩颇浓的人的洪流中，晃晃悠悠地随波逐流倒是颇为惬意，但是过不多久，我对于那种涌动的陌生人的浪涛，他们断断续续的笑声，那些紧盯着我的惊奇、陌生或者讥笑的目光，那种摩肩擦背的、不知不觉地推我往前的情景，那些从千百个小窗户里射来的灯光，以及刷刷不停的脚步声就无法忍受了。海上航行颠晃得厉害，我的血液里现在还骚动着一种晕乎乎、醉醺醺的感觉：脚下好似还在滑动和摇晃，大地似乎在喘息起伏，道路像在晃晃悠悠地飘上天空。这种喧闹嘈杂一下子弄得我头晕目眩，为了摆脱这种状况，我就拐进一条小街，连街名都没有看。从那里，我又拐进一条小巷，那无名的喧嚣这才渐渐平息下来。随后，我又漫无目的地继续走进那些血管似的纵横交错的小巷，进入这座迷宫。我离中心广场越远，这些小巷就越黑。这里已经没有大型弧光灯——宽阔的林荫大道上的月亮——的照耀了，透过微弱的灯光，我终于又能看见星星和披着黑幕的天空了。

我现在所处的位置大概离港口不远，在海员住宅区，因为我闻到了腐臭的鱼腥，闻到了被海浪冲上岸来的藻类散发出的甜丝丝的腐烂味，还有那种污浊的空气和密不通风的房间所特有的霉气，它潮湿地弥漫在各个角落里，一直要等到一场猛烈的暴风雨来临，才能让它们喘一口气。这捉摸不定的黑暗和意想不到的寂寞令我陶然，于是我便放慢脚步，仔细观察一条条各不相同的小巷：有的寂静无声，有的卖弄风情，但是所有的小巷全是黑黑的，都飘散着低沉的音乐声和说话声。这声音是从看不见的地方，是从屋宇里如此神秘地发出来的，以至于几乎猜不出隐秘的发声处，因为所有的房子都门窗紧闭，只有红色或黄色的灯光在闪烁。

我喜欢异国城市里的这些小巷，这个情欲泛滥的肮脏的市场，这些秘密地麇集着勾引海员的种种风情的场所。海员在陌生而危险的海上度过了许多寂寞之夜以后，来到这里过上一夜，在一小时之内就把他们许许多多销魂的春梦变为现实。这些小巷不得不藏在这座大城市的阴暗的一隅，因为它们厚颜无耻和令人难堪地说出了在那些玻璃窗擦得雪亮的灯火辉煌的屋子里，那些戴着各式各样假面具的体面人干的是些什么勾当。屋子的小房间里传出诱人的音乐，放映机映出刺眼的广告，预告即将上映的辉煌巨片，悬挂在大门门楣之下的小方灯眨巴着眼睛在亲切地向你问候，明明白白地邀你入内，透过半开的门户可以窥见戴着镀金饰物的一丝不挂的肉体在闪烁。咖啡馆里醉汉们大吵大嚷，赌徒们又喊又骂。海员们相遇都咧嘴一笑，他们呆滞的目光因即将享受的肉欲之欢而变得炯炯有神，因为这里什么都有：女人和赌博，佳酿和演出，肮脏的和高雅的风流艳遇。可是这一切都是羞答答的，奸诈地躲在假惺惺地垂下的百叶窗后面，全是在里面进行的，这种虚假的封闭性因其隐蔽和进出方便这双重诱惑而更加撩人。这些街道与汉堡、科伦坡、哈瓦那的街道差不多，就像大都市里的豪华大街都彼此相仿一样，因为上层和下层的生活，其形式各地都是相同的。这些不是老百姓的街道，是纵情声色、肉欲横流的畸形世界最后的奇妙的残余，是一片黝暗的情欲漫溢的森林和灌木丛，麇集着许多春情勃发的野兽。这些街道以其展露的东西使你想入非非，以其隐藏的东西让你神魂颠倒。你可以在梦里去造访这些街道。

这条小巷也是如此，进了这条小巷我感到一下就被它俘获了。于是我就跟在两个穿胸铠的骑兵后面去碰碰运气，他们挂在腰上的马刀碰在高低不平的路面上发出叮当的响声。几个女人在一家啤酒馆里喊他们，骑兵哈哈大笑，大声对她们开着粗鲁的玩笑。一个骑兵敲了敲窗户，随即就遭来一阵谩骂；骑兵继续往前走去，笑声也越来越远，一会儿我就听不见了。小巷里又没有了声息，几扇窗户在雾蒙蒙的黯淡的月光下闪着朦胧的灯光。我停下脚步，深深吸吮着夜的宁静。我觉得这宁静很奇怪，因为在它的后面有某种秘密、淫荡和危险的东西在微微作响。我清楚地感觉到，这种宁静是个骗局，在这条雾蒙蒙的黝暗的小巷里正弥散着世界上某种腐败之气。我站在那儿，倾听这空虚的世界。我已经感觉不到这座城市，这条小巷，以及它们的名称和我自己的名字，我只觉得，在这里我是外国人，已经奇妙地融进了一种我不知晓的东西之中，我没有打算，没有信息，也没有一点关系，可是我却充分感觉到我周围的黑暗生活，就像感觉到自己皮肤下面的血液一样。我只有这么种感觉：这一切都不是为我生发的，可是却又都属于我。这是一种最幸福的感觉，是由于漠不关心而得到的最深刻、最真切的体验所产生的，它是我内心生机勃勃的源泉，总让我莫名其妙地感到一种快意。正当我站在这条寂寞的小巷里聆听的时候，我仿佛期待着将会发生什么事似的，好把自己从患夜游症似的窃听人家隐私的感觉中推出来。这时我突然听见不知何处有人在忧郁地唱一首德国歌曲，《自由射手》[1]中那段朴素的圆舞曲：“少女那美丽的、绿色的花冠。”由于距离远或是被墙挡着的缘故，歌声很低，歌是女声唱的，唱得很蹩脚，可是这毕竟是德国曲调，在这里，在这世界上陌生的一隅听到用德文唱的这首歌，感到分外亲切。歌声不知是从何处飘来的，然而我却觉得它像一声问候，是几星期来我听到的第一句乡音。我不禁自问：谁在这里说我的母语？在这偏僻、荒凉的小巷里，谁的内心的回忆重新从心底唤起了这支凄凉的歌？我挨着一座座半睡的房子顺着歌声摸索着寻去。这些房子的百叶窗都垂落着，然而窗户后面却厚颜无耻地闪烁着灯光，有时还闪现出正在招客的手。墙外贴着一张张醒目的纸条，写着淡啤酒、威士忌、啤酒等饮料的名称，尽是些自吹自擂的广告，这说明，这里是一家隐蔽的酒吧，但是所有房子的大门都紧闭着，既拒人于门外，又邀你光顾。这时远处响起了脚步声，不过歌声一直未停，现在正用响亮的颤音唱着歌词的叠句，而且歌声越来越近：我找到了飘出歌声来的那所房子。我犹豫了片刻，随后便朝严严地垂着白色帘子的门走去。我正决意躬身进去的时候，走廊的暗影中突然有什么东西一动，是人影，显然正紧贴在玻璃窗上窥视，这时被吓了一大跳。此人的脸上虽然映着吊灯的红光，但还是被吓得刷白。这是个男人，他睁大眼睛盯着我，嘴里嘟哝着，像是说了句表示歉意的话，随即便在灯光昏暗的小巷里消失了。这种打招呼的方式也真怪。我朝他的背影望去，在光线微弱的小巷里，他的身影似乎还在挪动着，但是已经很模糊了。屋里歌声依旧，我觉得甚至更响了。我被歌声所吸引，于是便按动门把手开了门，快步走了进去。

像被一刀切断了似的，歌的最后一个字落了下来。我大吃一惊，觉得前面一片空虚，有一种含有敌意的沉默，仿佛我打碎了什么东西似的。渐渐地，我的目光才适应，发现这房间几乎是空空的，只有一张吧台和一张桌子，显然这里只是通往后面那些房间的前厅。后面的房间房门都半开着，灯光昏暗，床上铺得整整齐齐，单就这点，对于这些房间的原本用场就一目了然了。桌子前面，一位浓妆艳抹、面带倦容的姑娘支着胳膊，背倚桌子，吧台后面站着臃肿肥胖、脏兮兮黑乎乎的老板娘，她身边还有一位还算标致的姑娘。一进屋，我就向她们问了好，声音显得有点生硬，过了好一会儿才听到一句有气无力的回答。来到这空空的屋子，碰到如此紧张而冷淡的沉默，我感到很不舒服，真想立刻转身就走，可是我虽然尴尬，却又找不到什么借口，只好将就着在前面桌旁坐下。那姑娘这时才想起自己的职责，问我想喝点什么；听到她那生硬的法语，我马上就知道她是德国人。我要了啤酒，她拖着懒洋洋的步子去拿了啤酒来，这步子比她那浅薄的眼光更显得漠然和冷淡；她的眼睛有气无力地在眼皮底下微微闪着浊光，宛如行将熄灭的一对蜡烛。她按照这类酒吧的习惯，完全机械地在我的酒杯旁又为她自己放了一只杯子。在举杯为我祝酒时，她的目光空空地在我身上掠过：我这才有机会将她细细端详。她的脸倒还算漂亮，五官端正，但是好像是内心的疲惫使这张脸与面具相似，变得俗不可耐，面容憔悴，眼睑沉重，头发散乱；面颊被劣质化妆品弄得斑斑点点，已经开始凹陷，宽宽的皱痕一直伸到嘴角。衣服也是随随便便地披在身上，过量的烟酒使嗓音变得干涩而沙哑。总而言之，我感到这是一个疲惫不堪、麻木不仁、只是由于惯性才活着的人。我怀着拘谨而恐惧的心情向她提了一个问题。她回答的时候看都没看我，一副漫不经心的样子，毫无表情，几乎连嘴唇都没有动一下。我感到自己是不受欢迎的。老板娘在我身后打着哈欠，另一位姑娘坐在一角，眼睛朝这儿瞅着，似乎在等我叫她。我本想马上离开的，但我浑身发沉，另外好奇和恐惧心也把我吸引住了，使我像喝得醉醺醺的海员似的坐在这浑浊、闷热的空气里，因为淡漠也具有某种刺激性。

这时，我被身旁突然发出的一阵刺耳的笑声吓了一跳。与此同时，蜡烛的火苗也颤悠起来了：吹来一阵过堂风，我感觉到背后有人把门打开了。“你又来啦？”我旁边的女人用德语尖刻地嘲笑道，“你又绕着房子爬了，你这吝啬鬼？好吧，进来吧，我又不会揍你。”

她这样尖叫着打招呼，仿佛从胸中喷出一股火焰。我转过身来，先是朝她、随后又朝门口望了望。门还没有全开，我就认出了这颤颤悠悠的身影，认出了此人那唯唯诺诺的目光，他就是刚才像是贴在门上的那个人。他像个乞丐，怯生生地手里拿着帽子，被这刺耳的问候和哈哈大笑吓得直打哆嗦。这笑声犹如一阵痉挛，一下子把她笨重的身体都震得晃悠起来了，同时后面吧台那儿老板娘匆匆向她耳语了几句。

“坐那边，坐在法朗索瓦丝那里！”当这可怜人怯生生地拖着踢踢嗒嗒的步子走近她时，她大声呵斥道，“你没见我有客人吗！”

她用德语对他大声嚷嚷。老板娘和另一位姑娘听了都哈哈大笑，虽然她们什么也没听懂，不过看来她们是认识这位客人的。

“法朗索瓦丝，给他香槟，要贵的，给一瓶！”她笑着朝那边喊道，随后又冲他嘲讽地说，“要是嫌贵，那就去外面待着，你这可怜的吝啬鬼！你是想来白看我的吧，我知道，你是想来白捡便宜的。”

在这阵恶毒的笑声中，他长长的身躯好像融化了，背也驼了起来，一副忍气吞声的样子，仿佛要把这张脸藏起来似的，他伸手去拿酒瓶的时候，手抖得厉害，倒酒时把酒也洒到了桌上。他竭力想抬眼看看她的面孔，但是目光怎么也无法离开地面，一直盯着地上贴的瓷砖打转。现在，在灯光下我才看清他那张形容枯槁的面孔：疲惫不堪，毫无血色；潮湿、稀疏的头发贴在瘦骨嶙峋的头颅上；手腕松弛，像折断了似的——整个是一副有气无力的可怜相，但却心怀怨恨。他身上的一切都不对劲，都挪了位，而且蜷缩了。他的目光抬了一下，但马上又惊恐地垂了下去，眼睛里交织着一股恶狠狠的光。

“你别去理他！”姑娘以专横的口气用法语对我说，并紧紧抓住我的胳膊，像是要将我拉转身来似的，“这是我和他之间的旧账，不是今天的事。”随后她又龇着亮晶晶的牙齿，像要咬人似的冲他大声吆喝道：“尽管来偷听好了，你这老狐狸！你不是想听我说的话吗？我是说：我宁愿跳海，也不跟你走。”

老板娘和另一位姑娘又发出一阵哈哈大笑，笑得喘不过气来。看样子，对她们来说，这是一种寻常的逗乐，每天的笑料。可是，这时另一位姑娘突然做出温柔多情的样子，往他身上靠，并对他大献殷勤，发动攻势，他却吓得直打哆嗦，连拒绝的勇气都没有。看到这一切，我真有点毛骨悚然。每当他迷惘的目光以颇为愧赧又竭力讨好的神态看我的时候，我就感到心悸。我身边那个女人突然从松弛状态中惊醒过来，眼露凶光，连手都在颤抖，看到这副架势我很害怕。我把钱往桌上一扔，想走了，但是她没有拿钱。“要是他打扰你，我就把他，把这条狗撵出去。他必须照办。来，再跟我喝一杯。来！”她突然娇滴滴地做出一副媚态，紧紧倚在我身上，我立即就看出，这只不过是为了折磨别人而演的戏。她每做出一个狎昵的动作，就往那边瞧上一眼。我看到，她只要对我做出一个风骚的姿势，他全身就是一阵抽搐，仿佛在他身上放了一块烧红的烙铁似的。看到这种情景，真让人作呕。我不去理睬她，而是紧紧盯着他，现在气愤、恼怒、嫉妒和贪欲在他心里滋生，可是只要她一转过头来，他就赶忙弯下腰去，见此情景，我也感到不寒而栗。她紧紧地往我身上贴，我感觉到了她的身体，她那由于在这场恶毒的游戏中获得乐趣而颤抖的身体，她那散发着劣质脂粉味的刺眼的脸和她那松软的肉体的难闻的气味令我感到恐惧。为了避开她，我便拿出一支雪茄。正当我的目光在桌上寻找火柴时，她就向他发了话：“把火拿来！”

对她的这个厚颜无耻、蛮不讲理的命令，他竟百依百顺，这倒使我比他更为吃惊。见此情景，我就急忙自己找了火柴。可是，她的话竟像鞭子一样，啪的一下抽在了他身上。他拖着趔趄的脚步，蹒跚地走过来，把他的打火机放在桌上，动作非常之快，仿佛手碰了桌子就会被烧着似的。这瞬间，我的目光与他的相交叉，我看到，他的眼睛里隐含着无限的羞愧和切齿的愤恨。这卑躬屈节的目光刺痛了我这个男子汉和他的兄弟的心。我感到受了这女人的侮辱，也同他一起羞愧难当。

“非常感谢您，”我用德语说——她抽搐了一下——“本来就不该麻烦您的。”说着，我便向他伸出手去。他犹豫好一会儿之后，我才感到他湿润而瘦削的手指，突然间，他痉挛般地使劲握了握我的手，以表达他的感激之情。这瞬间，他的眼睛闪闪发亮，直视我的眼睛，但随即又低垂到松弛的眼睑下面去了。出于对那女人的反抗心理，我想请他坐到我们这边来。我的手大概流露出了邀请的姿势，因为这时她急忙冲他吼道：“你还是坐那儿去，别在这儿打扰！”

她那尖刻的声音和折磨人的恶行令我深恶痛绝。这烟味很浓的下等酒吧，这令人恶心的娼妓，这弱智的男人，这弥漫着啤酒、烟雾和劣质香水的气味对我有什么用？我渴望呼吸新鲜空气。我把钱推到她面前，正当她娇里娇气地挨近我的时候，我就站起身来，毅然躲开。我对参与这种侮辱人的缺德勾当极其厌恶，我以断然拒绝的态度清楚地表明，她的色相诱惑不了我。这时，她满脸怒容，嘴角起了一道皱褶，现出行将发作的神色，但她忍住没把话说出来，而心中的仇恨却一目了然。她猛地朝他转过身去，他见她这副横眉怒目的样子，被她的淫威吓得魂飞魄散，赶忙把手伸进口袋，哆哆嗦嗦地用手指头掏出一个钱包。匆忙之中他连钱包上的带子结都解不开，显然，现在他害怕单独同她待在一起。这是一只编织小包，上面嵌有玻璃珠珠，是农民和小老百姓用的。一眼就可看出，他不习惯乱花钱，不像那些把手伸进叮当作响的口袋，掏出一大把钱来往桌上一摔的海员；显然，他习惯于仔仔细细地点数，还要把钱用手指头夹着掂量一番。“瞧他为了这几个宝贝角子都抖成了什么样子！不觉得太慢了吗？你就等着吧！”她挖苦道，并往前逼进一步。他吓得直往后退，而她见他这副丧魂落魄的样子，便把肩膀一耸，眼里含着极其厌恶的神情说道：“我不拿你一分钱，你的钱让我恶心。我知道，你的几个宝贝小钱都是有数的，一个子儿也舍不得多花。只不过，”她突然拍了拍他的胸脯，“别让人把你缝在这儿的票子偷了去啊！”

果真，就像正在发作的心脏病患者突然抓住胸口一样，他那苍白而颤抖的手紧紧抓住外衣上的那个地方，他的手指下意识地在那儿摸了摸那个秘密的藏钱之处，这才放心地把手放下。“吝啬鬼！”说着，她啐了一口吐沫。这时，那备受折磨的人突然满脸通红，猛地把钱包摔给了另一位姑娘，从她身边冲出大门，像是从大火中逃了出来似的。那姑娘先是吓得大叫一声，随即便哈哈大笑。

她气得火冒三丈，眼露凶光，先还直愣愣地站了一会儿，随后就又松弛地耷拉下眼皮，筋疲力尽地弯下松弛下来的身体。在这一分钟里她看上去显得又老又疲倦。她现在投向我的目光里压抑着某种犹豫不决、茫然若失的神情。她站在这里，满脸羞愧，迟钝麻木，像个喝得烂醉醒过来的醉妇。“到了外面他会为他失去的钱而心痛的，也许会跑去报警，说我偷了他的钱。不过明天他又会到这儿来的。然而他休想得到我。谁都可以得到我，只有他不能！”

她走到吧台前，扔下几个硬币，咕噜噜一口气吞下一杯烈酒。她的眼里又露出了凶光，但很浑浊，像是蒙了一层愤怒和羞辱的泪水。看到她我感到十分恶心，对她没有丝毫同情。我道了声“晚安！”就走了。老板娘回了句“Bonsoir”[2]。那女人没有回过头来，只是发出一阵刺耳的、讥讽的大笑。

我出得门来，外面只有黑夜和天空，到处笼罩着闷热的昏暗，漠漠云层遮掩着无限遥远的月光。我贪婪地吸着微热的，但却沁人肺腑的空气，我为森罗万象的人生际遇感到无比惊奇，那种恐怖的感觉消散了。我又感到，每扇玻璃窗后面总在上演一出命运剧，每扇大门都展示着一场风流韵事，这个世界上的事真是千姿百态，无所不在，即便在这最最肮脏的一角也像在萤火虫闪烁不灭的光照下映现出种种窃玉偷香的悲剧。这是一种会使我无比陶醉，乃至流下眼泪的感觉。方才见到的那些令人厌恶的情景已经远去，紧张的情绪变成了舒心适意的倦意，渴望把这种种经历过的事情变成更美的梦。我的目光下意识地朝周围寻觅了一番，想在这纵横交错的迷宫似的小巷中找到回旅店的路。这时，一个人影趔趄着脚步，到了我身边，他准是悄没声地先走近来了。

“请您原谅，”我立刻就听出了这低三下四的声音，“我想，您找不到路了。能允许我……允许我给您指路吗？这位老爷是住在……？”

我说了旅店的名字。

“我陪您去……要是您允许的话。”他马上谦恭地加了一句。

恐惧又袭上我的心头。在我身边，蹑手蹑足、幽灵似的脚步在移动，虽然几乎听不见，但却紧紧地跟在我身边，还有这条海员巷的黝暗和对刚才所经历的事情的回忆，这一切渐渐为一种梦幻般的紊乱的感觉所代替，既无判断，也无反抗。我没有看到他的眼睛，但却感觉到他低三下四的目光，我还觉察到他的嘴唇在颤动；我知道，他想跟我说话，可是我既没有表示同意，也没有表示反对，我的感觉正处于昏昏沉沉的状态之中，我的好奇心同身体迷迷糊糊的感觉一起一伏地融合在一起。他轻轻地咳了好几次，我发觉，他的话被嗓子眼里的什么东西堵住了，那女人的残忍竟神秘莫测地转到了我身上，所以见他的羞耻感同急于要倾吐的心情在搏斗，我就感到暗自欣喜：我没有助他一臂之力，而是让沉默又厚又重地挡在我们之间，只听见我们杂乱的脚步声——他的脚轻轻地趿拉着，像老人一样，我的脚步故意踩得又重又响，仿佛要逃离这肮脏的世界似的。我感到我们之间的紧张气氛越来越强烈：这沉默充满了内心的尖声呼喊，好似一根绷得过紧的弦。后来他终于打破沉默，先是极其胆怯地说道：

“您……您……我的老爷……您在那屋里见到了蹊跷的一幕……请原谅……请原谅我又提起这件事……您一定觉得她很奇怪……觉得我很可笑……这女人……就是……”

他的话又停住了。他的喉咙像被什么东西紧紧哽住了。随后，他的声音变得很小，匆匆地悄声说道：“这女人……就是我的老婆。”这话惊得我差点儿跳了起来，因为他很抱歉似的连忙说：“就是说……以前是我的老婆……五年，是四年前……在我的老家黑森的格拉茨海姆……老爷，我不希望您把她想得很坏……她成了这样，也许是我的过错。以前她并不总是这样……是我……是我把她折磨成现在这样的……虽然她很穷，穷得连衣服都没有，她什么东西都没有，我还是娶了她……我呢，我很有钱……就是说颇有资产……不算很有钱……或者说至少那时……您知道，我的老爷……她说得对，我以前也许很节俭……但这是以前的事了，还在不幸发生之前，我诅咒这件事……我的父母亲都很节俭，大家都这样……每一分钱都是我拼命工作挣来的……她却过得很轻松，她喜欢漂亮的高档东西……但她很穷，为此我一再责骂她……我本不该这样的，现在我才知道，我的老爷，因为她骄傲自大，目空一切……您别以为她那副样子是真的，不，她是装出来的……是为了给人看的，她自己内心也很痛苦……她这样做只是……只是为了伤害我，为了折磨我……因为，因为她感到羞愧……或许她真的变坏了，但是我……我并不相信……因为，我的老爷，她这人以前是很好，很好的……”

他擦了擦眼泪，心情十分激动，便停了下来。我不由得看了他一眼，突然间，我不再觉得他可笑了，就连“我的老爷”这个在德国只有下等人才用的奇怪的、低三下四的称呼也不再觉得刺耳了。由于费劲说出了心里话，他的面孔显得十分舒展，现在他又迈着沉重的脚步踉踉跄跄地继续往前走去，但却目不转睛地盯着石铺的路面，仿佛在摇曳的灯光下费劲地读着从痉挛的喉咙里痛苦地吐出来刻在路面上的话。

“是的，我的老爷，”现在他深深地吸了口气，声音低沉，与刚才完全不同，就像发自一个较为温和的内心世界一样，“她原来非常好……对我也很好，我使她摆脱了贫困，她很感激……我也知道，她很感激……但是……我……乐意听感恩的话……一次又一次……一次又一次地听感恩的话……听到感恩的话，我心里很舒服……我的老爷，我感到自己比她强，心里就美滋滋的，舒坦极了……要是我知道，我是个坏人……为了不断听到她对我说感恩的话，我真愿把所有的钱都拿出来……她非常傲气，她发觉我要她感恩时，反而说得越来越少了……所以……也仅仅是这个原因，我的老爷，我就总是让她来求我……我从不主动给她钱……她要买件衣服，买条带子都得来向我乞求，我心里感到很惬意……我就这样折磨了她三年，而且越来越厉害……可是，我的老爷，这仅仅是因为我爱她……我喜欢她的傲气，可是我又总想打掉她的傲气，我真是个疯子，她一要什么东西，我就火冒三丈……但是，我的老爷，我这并不是真的……只要有机会侮辱她，我就快活得要命，因为……因为我根本就不知道，我是多么爱她……”

他又不说了。他蹒跚地走着。显然，他把我忘了。他不由自主地说着，像在梦里似的，而且声音越来越大。

“这事……这事我那时……在那个晦气的日子才明白……那天，她为她母亲要一点钱，只是很少、很少一点，我没有答应她……实际上钱我已经准备好了，但是我想让她再来……再来求我一次……啊，我说什么啦？……是的，那天晚上我回到家里，她已经走了，只在桌上留了一张字条，这时我才明白过来……‘你就留着你那些该死的钱吧，你的一个子儿我也不要了。’……字条上就写了这些，再没有一句别的话……老爷，三天三夜我就像发了疯一样。我请人到河里去找，到树林里去寻，给了警察好几百个马克……所有的邻居家我都去了，但是他们对我只是嘲笑和挖苦……一丝形迹都没发现……后来，另一个村的人告诉我，说他曾经见她在火车上同一个士兵在一起……她到柏林去了……当天我就赶了去……我放弃了我的收入……损失了几千马克……大家都偷我的东西，我的仆人、管家，大家都偷……但是，我向您起誓，我的老爷，我觉得这些都无所谓……我在柏林住了一个星期，终于在这个人流的旋涡里找到了她……我到了她那里……”他重重地吸了口气。

“我向您起誓，我的老爷……我没有对她说一句重话……我哭了……我跪了下来……我答应把钱……把我的全部财产都拿出来，让她掌管，因为那时我已经知道……没有她我就活不了。我爱她身上的每一根毛发……她的嘴……她的身体，爱她的一切……是我，是我一个人把她推下火坑的呀……我走进屋里时，她的脸一下变得刷白，像死人一样……我买通她的女房东，一个拉皮条的下流女人……她靠在墙上，脸色像墙上的白灰……她仔细地听着我说。老爷，我觉得……她，是的，她见到我几乎很高兴……可是我谈到钱的时候……我所以谈到钱，我向您起誓，只不过是为了向她表明，钱我已经不再考虑了……这时她却啐了一口……接着就……因为我一直还不想走……这时她就把她的情夫叫来，他们一起把我取笑了一通……可是，我的老爷，我还是老去那儿，每天都去。那儿的人把一切都告诉了我，我得知，那无赖把她扔了，她的生活非常困难，于是我又去那儿一次……一次又一次，老爷，可是她把我骂了一顿，并把我偷偷搁在桌上的钞票撕得粉碎，我再去那儿时，她已经走了……为了再找到她，我的老爷，我真是竭尽了全力！整整一年，这我可向您起誓，我不是在生活，而只是不停地在打听，我还雇了几个侦探，后来终于打探出，她到了那边，在阿根廷……流落……流落青楼……”他犹豫了片刻。说最后这个词的时候就像要断气一样。他的声音变得更低沉了。

“起初，我吓了一跳……但是后来我思忖，是我，就只是我，把她推下深渊的……我想，她受了多少苦啊，这可怜的女人……主要是因为她太傲……我找了我的律师，他给领事写了信，寄了钱去……没让她知道是谁寄的……只是要她回来。我接到电报，说一切都办得很顺利……我知道了她回来时坐的轮船……我就在阿姆斯特丹等着……我提前三天到了那里，真是心急如焚……轮船终于到了，才见到地平线上轮船冒出的烟，我就乐不可支，我觉得我简直无法等到轮船慢慢地、慢慢地驶近并靠岸了，船开得很慢，很慢，随后旅客从跳板上过来了，她终于，终于……我没有立即认出她……她的样子变了……脸上涂了脂粉，就是……就是这样，您所见的那副模样……她见我在等她……她的脸色变得煞白……幸好有两名海员把她扶住，要不然她就从跳板上摔下去了……她一上岸，我就走到她身边……我什么也没有说……我的喉咙像是卡住了……她也没有说话……也不看我……挑夫挑着行李走在前面，我们走着，走着……突然，她停住脚步，说……老爷，她说的话……让我心痛，听了真让人伤心……‘你还愿意让我做你的老婆？现在也还愿意吗？’……我握着她的手……她哆嗦着，但没有说话。可是我感觉到，现在一切又言归于好了……老爷，我是多么幸福啊！我把她领进房间以后，我就像个孩子似的围着她跳，还伏在她脚下……我一定说了些愚蠢透顶的话……因为她含着眼泪在微笑，并爱抚着我……当然是怯生生的……可是，老爷，我感到好适意啊……我的心融化了。我从楼梯上跑上跑下，在旅店里订了午餐……我们的婚宴……我帮她穿好结婚礼服……我们下楼，喝酒吃饭，好不快乐……噢，她快活得像个孩子，那么亲热和温厚，她谈论着我们的家……谈到我们要重新添置的各种东西……这时……”他突然粗着嗓门说，并且做了个手势，仿佛要把谁砸烂似的，“这时……这时来了一个茶房……一个卑鄙的小人……他以为我喝醉了，因为我发了疯似的，跳啊，笑啊，还笑着在地上打滚……我只是因为太高兴了啊……噢，高兴得不知所以，这时……我付了账，他少找我二十法郎……我把他斥责了一顿，并要他把钱补给我……他很尴尬，便搁下那枚金币……这时……这时她突然尖声大笑……我愣愣地盯着她，她的面孔已经变了样……一下子变得嘲讽、严厉和凶狠……‘你还是老样子……甚至在我们结婚的日子也一点没变！’她冷冷地说，语气那么锋利，那么……伤心。我心里感到惶恐，诅咒自己那么斤斤计较……我设法重新笑了起来……但是她的快乐情绪已经没有了……已经消失殆尽……她自己单独要了房间……对于她我没有什么东西舍不得的……夜里我独自躺在床上，心里盘算着第二天早上给她买些什么东西……作为礼物送给她……我要向她表明，我这人并不小气……再也不违背她的心意了。第二天一大早我就出去，给她买了手镯，然而，我回来走进她的房间……房里已经空了……同上次完全一样。我知道，桌上准留了字条……我走开了，向上帝祈祷，希望这次不是真的……但是……但是……桌上果真留了字条……上面写着……”他犹豫了。我下意识地停住脚步，望着他。他耷拉着脑袋，过了一会儿，他以嘶哑的声音低声说道：

“上面写着……‘让我安静吧。你让我感到恶心……’”

我们到了港口，突然，近处波涛拍岸的轰鸣打破了黑夜的沉寂。停泊在近处和远处的海轮宛如一只只黑色巨兽，都睁着亮晶晶的眼睛，不知从何处传来了歌声。什么东西都看不清楚，但却感觉到许多东西，一座人口稠密的城市正在沉睡，正在做着可怕的梦。在我身边，我感觉到这个人的影子，它幽灵似的在我脚前颤动，在摇曳的昏暗灯光中，时而拉长，时而缩短。我一句话也说不出，既想不出话来安慰他，也没有什么问题要问他，但是我感到他的沉默粘在了我身上，粘得很紧，使我感到压抑。突然，他颤战栗栗地抓住我的手臂。

“可是，没有她我是不会离开这儿的……我找了几个月才重新找到她……她在折磨我，但是，我会百折不挠地坚持下去的……我的老爷，我求您，请您跟她谈谈……我不能没有她，请把这话告诉她……我的话她不听……我再也不能这样活着了……我再也不能看着男人上她那儿去了……我再也不能在门口守着他们重新走出来……一个个喝得醉醺醺地哈哈大笑……这条巷里的人都认识我……他们只要看见我在那儿等着，就哈哈大笑……快把我弄疯了……可是，每天晚上我还是照样站在那儿……我的老爷。求求您……请您跟她谈谈……我是不认识您，但是，看在仁慈的上帝分上，请您跟她谈谈……”

我下意识地想从他手中把胳膊脱出来。我感到心里发毛。可是他却觉得我对他的不幸无动于衷，于是突然跪在街心，把我的脚抱住。

“我恳求您，我的老爷……您一定得跟她谈谈……您一定得……要不然定会发生可怕的事的……为了找她，我花掉了所有的钱，我不会让她留在这里……不会让她活着留在这里。我已经买了一把刀……我买了一把刀，我的老爷……我决不让她留在这里……决不让她活着留在这里……我受不了……请您跟她谈谈，我的老爷……”他像发了疯似的在我面前直打滚。就在这时，街上有两个警察朝这儿走来。我一把将他拉起。他直愣愣地盯着我看了一会儿，随后便用完全陌生的、干巴巴的声音说：

“顺着这条巷子，您在那儿拐进去，就到您住的旅店了。”他又一次愣愣地看着我，瞳孔好像融化了，白白的，空洞洞的，很是吓人。接着他就离开了。

我紧紧裹着大衣。我冷得发抖。我只感到疲倦，觉得醉醺醺的，昏沉而麻木，好似梦游一般，同时我又有一种不祥的预感。我想好好想一想，把这些事情思考一番，可是那疲倦却时时从我心头翻起黑浪，将我卷走。我摸索着回到旅店，往床上一倒，睡得沉沉的，像头牲畜。

第二天早晨，这件事情中到底哪些是梦幻，哪些是真的，我也弄不清了，而且我心中也有什么东西不让我去弄清楚。我醒得很晚，我是这座陌生城市里的陌生人。我去参观一座教堂，它的古代镶嵌艺术据说很有名。但是我的眼睛望着教堂，什么也没有看进去，昨天夜里所遇之事又浮现在我眼前，越来越清晰，而且轻而易举地推我去寻找这条小巷和那所房子。可是这些奇怪的小巷只有夜里才有生气，白天都戴着灰色的、冷冰冰的面具，只有熟悉的人才能认出面具下面的条条小巷来。我怎么找也没找到那条小巷。我又失望又疲惫地回到住处，脑子里总也摆脱不了那种种图像，不知是妄想中的还是回忆中的那些图像。

我乘坐的火车晚上九点开。我怀着遗憾的心情离开这座城市。挑夫扛起我的行李，在我前面朝车站走去。在一个十字路口，突然有什么东西使我转过头来：我认出了通向那座房子去的那条横着的小巷。我让挑夫等一下，就走过去再朝那条烟花巷看了一眼，挑夫先是有点吃惊，随后就调皮而会心地笑了。

巷子里黑黑的，同昨天一样，在淡淡的月光下我看见那座房子的玻璃门在闪闪发亮。我还想再走近一点，这时黑暗中出来一个身影，发出簌簌的声响。我感到不寒而栗。我认出了那个人，他正蹲在门槛上向我招手。我想走近一点，但是我心里发怵，所以赶紧逃走，怕被缠在这里，误了火车。

但是，后来在拐角处我正要转身时，又回头望了望。我的目光与他相遇时，他猛地一使劲，站了起来，朝大门撞去。他手里金属的亮光一闪，因为这时他飞快地打开了门，我从远处看不清他手里拿的到底是金币还是刀子，反正在月色中他手指缝里有亮晶晶的闪光……

看不见的藏品

——德国通货膨胀时期[1]的故事


韩耀成　译

列车开出德累斯顿两站，一位上了年纪的先生上了我们的车厢，谦恭有礼地向大家打过招呼，然后抬起眼，像对一位老朋友似的特地再次朝我点头致意。最初的一瞬间，我想不起他是谁了；可是待他微微含笑，正要说出他的姓名时，我立刻就想起来了：他是柏林最有名望的艺术古董商之一，和平时期[2]我常常到他店里去观赏和购买旧书和名人手迹。我们起先随便聊了些无关紧要的事。接着他忽然突如其来地说道：

“我得告诉您，我是刚从哪儿来的。因为这个故事可以说是我这个老古董商37年职业生涯中所遇到的最离奇的事。您本人大概也知道，自从货币的价值就像逸散的煤气荡然无存以来，艺术品市场上是什么情况：暴发户突然对哥特式的圣母像和15世纪印刷术发明初期的古版书，以及古老的蚀刻印制品和画像大为青睐；这帮人胃口之大你连变都变不过来，因此还不得不防范他们把屋里的东西一扫而光。他们恨不得连你袖口上的扣子和桌上的台灯都买了去。所以要搞到新的商品也就越来越难了——请原谅，我竟突然把这些我们一向对之心存敬畏的物品称之为商品——，但是这批兜里鼓鼓的土老鳖甚至已经让人习惯于把一部精美的威尼斯古版书仅仅视为一笔美金，把圭尔奇诺[3]的一幅素描看作是几张100法郎钞票的等价物。这帮突然出现的购买狂个个涎皮赖脸，死缠硬磨，你怎么拒绝阻挡都无济于事。所以我一夜之间就被敲骨吸髓，弄得一贫如洗。我们这家老店号是我父亲从祖父手里接过来的，如今店里只好卖些寒碜的下脚货，这都是些从前连北方的街头废品商贩都不屑放到他们手推车上去的破烂；目睹此情此景我羞愧难当，真恨不得将卷帘百叶窗放下，关门拉倒。

“在这种狼狈处境中，我想到，何不把我们的业务旧册簿拿来翻一翻，找出几位昔日的主顾，兴许还可以从他们那儿弄回几件副本呢。这种老主顾名录总像一片墓地，特别是现在这个时候，其实并不会给我多少引导。因为我们以前的主顾大多不得不早就把他们的藏品拍卖掉了，或者早已去世，对于剩下的少数几位，也不能抱有什么指望。这时我突然翻到一捆大概是我们最早的一位主顾的信件，此人我早就把他忘了，因为从1914年世界大战爆发以来，他再也未曾向我们订购或者咨询过什么。我们的通信几乎可以追溯到60年以前，这可没有一点儿夸张！他在我父亲和我祖父手里就买过东西，可是在我自己经手的37年里，我记不得他曾经来过我们店里。种种迹象表明，他一定是个古怪的旧式滑稽人物，是门采尔或者施皮茨韦格[4]笔下那种早已匿迹的德国人，他们有的还活到我们这个时代，在外省的小城镇有时还可见到，都成了稀有怪人。他手书的文本可说是书法珍品，写得干干净净，每笔款项下面都用尺子和红墨水画上横道，而且总要把数字写两遍，以免出现差错；再有，他还利用裁下的信笺空白页和翻过来的旧信封写信。凡此种种都表明，这个不可救药的外省人十分小家子气，是个狂热的节俭癖。这些奇特的文件除了他的签名之外，往往还署着他的各种繁冗的头衔：退休林务官兼经济顾问，退休少尉，一级铁十字勋章获得者。这位1870年[5]的耆宿，要是还活着的话，至少也有80岁高龄了。可是这位滑稽可笑、节俭入迷的人物作为古代版画收藏家却表现出不同凡响的聪慧、精邃的知识和高雅的情趣。于是我慢慢整理出他将近60年的订单，其中第一份订单还是用银币结算的。我发现，在一塔勒[6]还可以买一大批最精美德国木刻的那个时代，这位不显山露水的外省人定已悄没声儿地收藏了一批铜版画，和那些暴发户名噪一时的收藏相比，他的这些藏品却更令人刮目相看。因为在半个世纪里，他单在我们店里每次用不多的马克和芬尼[7]购得的东西积攒在一起，在今天恐怕已经价值连城了。除此之外，还可以想见，他在拍卖行和其他商号一定也捞到了不少便宜货。当然，从1914年以来再没有收到过他的订单。我对艺术品市场的行情十分熟悉，要说这样一批藏品无论公开拍卖或者私下出售，是一定瞒不过我的。如此说来，这位奇人想必现在还活着，或者这批藏品现在就在他的继承人手里。

“这件事情引起了我的兴趣，第二天，也就是昨天晚上，我立刻乘火车直奔萨克逊一座凋敝的外省小城镇而去。当我出了小火车站，信步走上主要大街时，我觉得在这些平庸、俗气、带着小市民趣味的房子当中，在其中的某个屋子里竟住着一位拥有保存得完整无损的伦勃朗[8]极其精美的画作、以及丢勒[9]和曼特尼亚[10]版画的人，这简直让人难以置信。我到邮局去打听，这里有没有一位叫这个名字的林务官或者经济顾问。当得知这位老先生确实还活着时，我真感到惊讶不已，于是，我在午饭前便动身前往他家，说实话，我心里真还有些忐忑不安呢。

“我毫不费劲就找到了他的住处。他的寓所在那种简陋的外省楼房的三层。这种楼房大概是在上世纪60年代由某位善于投机的泥瓦匠设计，匆忙地盖起来的。二层楼上住着一位老实的裁缝师傅；三楼的左侧挂着一块闪闪发亮的邮政局长的门牌，在右侧终于看到了写有这位林务官兼经济顾问姓名的瓷牌。我怯生生地按了一下门铃，立刻就出现一位头戴干净小黑帽的白发老妪。我把我的名片递给她，并问，能否跟林务官先生谈谈。她先是惊讶地、有些怀疑地看了看我，然后看了我的名片。在这座被世界遗忘的小镇上，在这么一幢老式的房子里，居然有人从外地来访，这可是一件大事。她和蔼地请我稍等，便拿着名片进屋去了。我听见她在屋里小声说着，接着突然听见一个响亮的男人声音大声地说：‘啊，R先生……从柏林来的，从那家大古董店来的……快请进，快请进……我很高兴！’这时，老夫人又急步来到门口，请我进屋。

“我脱下大衣，走进屋去。在这间陈设简单的屋子当中，站着一位身体还很硬朗的耄耋老人，他身板挺直，蓄着浓密的髭须，身着半军装式的镶边便服，热情地向我伸出双手。这个手势明白无误地表示出他喜悦的、自然流露的欢迎，可是这又与他站在那里呆滞的奇怪神情形成明显的反差。他一步也不向我迎来，我只好走到他跟前，心里略感诧异地去握他的手。可是当我要去握他的手时，我从这双手纹丝不动地所保持的水平姿势上发现，他的手不是在找我的手，而是在等待。一下子我全明白了：这是位盲人。

“我从小迎面看见瞎子心里就感到很不舒服。每当想到一个人活生生的，同时又知道，他对我没有我对他那样的感受时，心里总排遣不了羞惭和不是味儿的那种体悟。就是此刻，在我看到在他向上竖起的浓密的白眉毛下那双直愣愣凝视着虚空的瞎眼睛时，也得克服我心里最初的恐惧。可是这位盲人没让我长时间去发愣，因为我的手刚一碰到他的手，他就使劲将我的手握住，并且用热烈而愉快的响亮声音再次向我表示欢迎：‘真是稀客！’他笑容满面地对我说，‘确实是奇迹，柏林的大老板竟会光临寒舍……不过，俗话说得好，商人上门，可得多多留神！……我们家乡常说：来了吉卜赛，快快关上大门扎紧口袋！……是啊，我可以想象，您干吗来找我。在我们可怜的、衰落的德国，现在生意很不景气，没有买主了，于是大老板们又想起了他们的老主顾，又找他们的羔羊来了。不过，我怕您在我这儿交不到好运，我们这些可怜的吃养老金的老人，只要有口饭吃就心满意足了。你们现在把物价弄得疯涨，我们可是没法跟上……我们这样的人是永远被抛弃了。’

“我立即纠正他的话，说他误解了我的来意。我来这儿，并不是要向他兜售什么东西，我只不过是正好来到近处，不想错过这个来拜访他这位我们店号多年的老主顾和德国最大的收藏家之一的机会。我刚说出‘德国最大的收藏家之一’这句话，老人脸上就出现了奇怪的变化。他仍然直愣地、呆滞地站在屋子中间，但是现在他的脸上突然开朗了，而且现出内心深处有种自豪的神情。他转向他估计夫人所在的方位，仿佛想说：‘你听见了吗！’随后他转过脸对我说，声音里充满快乐，刚才说话时还显露出的那种军人的粗暴口气已经无影无踪，而是以和顺，甚至可说是轻柔的语调说：

“‘您这确实是太好了，确实太好了……不过也不会让你白来一趟的。我要给您看些东西，这可不是您每天都看得到的，即使是在您引以为豪的柏林……给您看几幅画，就是在阿尔贝特[11]和讨厌的巴黎也找不更好的了……可不是，60年下来，收集了各种各样的东西，这些宝贝可不是平时能在大街上随便见到的。路易丝，把柜子的钥匙给我！’

“这时，发生了一件意想不到的事。这位站在他旁边客气地微笑着，和蔼可亲地静听我们谈话的老太太，这时突然举起双手向我恳求，同时剧烈地摇着脑袋以示反对。起先我还不明白，她的这个信号这是什么意思。随后她先走到她丈夫跟前，双手轻轻地搭在丈夫肩上：‘可是，赫尔曼，你也不问问这位先生，现在有没有时间看你的藏品，现在到中午了。吃过午饭你得休息一小时，这是大夫特别要求的。等吃完饭你再把你那些东西让这位先生看，然后我们一起喝咖啡，这不是更好吗？那时安纳玛丽也在家，对这些东西她比我懂得多，她可以帮你的忙！’

“她刚说了这些话，似乎越过她毫无所知的丈夫，再次向我重复了那个急切恳求的手势。这下我明白她的意思了。我知道，她是让我不要答应马上就观赏他的藏画，所以我立即借口说，有人请我吃饭。我表示，能允许我观赏他的藏品，我感到莫大的快乐和荣幸，可是在三点以前几乎不可能，三点以后我将乐于再来。

“他生气了，就像是被人把最心爱的玩具拿走了的孩子。他转过身来咕哝着说道：‘当然，这些柏林的大老板总是忙得不可开交。可是这次您可得拿出点时间来，因为这些藏品不是三五幅画，而是27个收藏夹，每位大师一个，而且没有一个收藏夹没有装满。那么，说好下午三点；可得要准时，要不我们就看不完了。’

“他又朝空中向我伸出手来，‘您看吧，您会高兴——或者生气的。您越生气，我就越高兴。我们收藏家就是这样：一切都为我们自己，不为别人！’他再次使劲握了我的手。

“老太太一直把我送到门口。在这段时间里，我注意到她一直忧心忡忡，显出又尴尬又恐惧的神色。可是现在快到门口了，她就压低嗓子，结结巴巴地说道：‘你来我们家之前……可以让我女儿安纳玛丽……去接您吗？……由于种种原因……这样较为妥当……您大概是在旅馆里用饭吧？’

“‘是的。我很高兴，我会感到非常愉快的。’我说。

“果然，一小时以后，我在市场附近那家旅馆的小餐厅刚刚吃完午饭，就进来一位衣着朴素、不很年轻的姑娘，睁大眼睛往四处找人。我朝她走去，做了自我介绍，并告诉她，我已准备停当，可以马上跟她一起去看藏画。可是她的脸一下子突然涨得通红，表现出慌乱和尴尬的神情，就像她母亲先前那样。她恳请我，动身前能不能先跟我说几句话。我马上就看出，她很为难。每当她鼓起勇气，想要说话的时候，脸上忐忑不安、颤动不定的红晕便一直升到她的额头，一只手折卷着裙子。末了，她终于结结巴巴地开口了，这当间又一再沉入内心的慌乱：

“‘我母亲让我来找您的……她什么都跟我说了……我们对您有个很大的恳求……在您到我父亲那儿去之前，我们想先把情况告诉您……父亲当然要让您看他的藏品，可是这些藏品……这些藏品……已经不很全了……其中缺了好些……可惜，甚至缺了相当多……’

“这时，她不得不再喘口气，随后突然凝视着我，匆匆地说道：

“‘我必须坦诚地跟您说……您了解这个时代，您什么都会理解……战争爆发以后，父亲的双目完全失明，在此之前，他的视力就常出问题，后来因为激动，他的视力就完全丧失了——起先，尽管那时他已是76岁高龄了，他还是决意要到法国去打仗，后来德国军队没像1870年那样往前挺进，把他气得七窍生烟，这时他的视力就急剧下降。不过除了视力不济之外，他的身体还是十分硬朗的，直到不久前他还能一连散步几小时，甚至能去进行他喜爱的打猎。可是现在他不能出去散步了，他剩下的唯一的乐趣就是他的藏品，他每天都要欣赏……这就是说，这些藏品他是看不见了，他什么也看不见，可是每天下午他都要把所有的收藏夹拿出来，至少可以把这些画摸一摸，总是按照同样的顺序一张一张地摸，几十年来，他已经将这个顺序背熟了……现在他对别的东西已经没有兴趣，我得老给他念报上各种拍卖的消息，价格越涨，他越高兴……因为……对物价和时代父亲一点也不了解，这才是最可怕的……他不知道，我们已经失去了一切，他每月的养老金还维持不了两天的生活……再加上我妹夫又阵亡了，留下她和四个孩子……可是父亲对于我们这些物质上的困难却全然不知。起初我们省吃俭用，比从前更节省，但无济于事。后来我们就开始变卖东西——我们当然不碰他心爱的藏品……我们卖掉了仅有的那点首饰，可是，上帝呀，这又能卖多少钱！60年来父亲把能省下的每一芬尼全都用来买画了。有一天，家里再没有什么可卖的了……我们真不知道这日子怎么过下去。这时候……这时候，母亲和我就卖了一幅画。父亲要是知道，那是绝对不会允许的。他不知道，日子过得多么艰难，他根本想不到，在黑市上弄点儿食物有多难，他也不知道，我们已经战败了，阿尔萨斯和洛林已经割让出去[12]，我们再也不把报上的所有这些消息念给他听了，免得他激动。

“‘我们卖了一幅非常珍贵的画，一幅伦勃朗的蚀刻画。商人给我们出价好几千马克，我们本指望用这笔钱维持几年生活的，可是您知道，货币熔化起来有多快……我们把剩下的钱全部存进银行，可是两个月后就付之东流了。因此，我们只好再卖掉一幅，又卖掉一幅，商人总是很晚才把钱寄来，这时货币又已经贬值了。后来我们就拿到拍卖行去，可是尽管人家出价几百万，我们也还是受骗……等这几百万到我们手里，已经成了一堆分文不值的废纸。就这样，仅仅为了维持我们最可怜的生活，父亲收藏的珍品，连同几幅名画，全都渐渐流失了，而父亲对此却毫不知情。’

“‘所以您今天一来，我母亲就吓坏了……因为要是父亲给您打开那些收藏夹，那么事情就露馅儿了……每个旧画框，父亲一摸就知道。我们把复制品或者相似的画页放进画框，代替那些卖掉的画，这样他摸的时候，就不会有所觉察。只要他能触摸、能清点这些画页（这些画的顺序他已准确地熟记于心），那他就会感到跟从前睁着双眼欣赏这些作品的时候同样的高兴。而平时在这个小镇上，我父亲认为没有人配得上看他的宝贝……每一张画他都爱不释手，我相信，要是他知道，他这些画早就在他手底下流失了，他一定会心碎的。这些年来，自从德累斯顿铜版画陈列馆的前任馆长去世以后，您是第一位他愿意让看他的收藏夹的人。所以我请求您……’

“这位不再年轻的姑娘突然举起双手，眼里闪着晶莹的泪花。

“‘……我们请求您……别让他伤心……别让我们伤心……请您别把他这个最后的幻想毁掉，请您帮助我们，让他相信，所有他将向您描述的画还都存在……要是他猜到了真相，他就活不下去了。也许我们做的这件事对不起他，但是我们没有别的法子：人总得活啊……人的生命，我妹妹的四个孤儿，总比印在纸上的画重要吧……到今天，我们也一直没有夺走他的这个乐趣；每天下午能把他的收藏夹翻上三个钟头，跟每幅画都像跟人似的说说话，他就感到很快活。今天……今天说不定会是他最快活的日子。他盼了好些年，盼着有朝一日能给一位行家展示他心爱的宝贝；我请您……我举起双手恳请您，别毁掉他的快乐。’

“她这番话说得那样感人肺腑，我现在的复述，根本无法表达她的这种感情。上帝呀，作为商人，我见过许多人被通货膨胀卑鄙地洗劫一空，弄得倾家荡产，他们上百年祖传的珍宝被人用一个黄油面包就给骗走了——但是在这儿命运创造了一个特例，使我特别震撼。不言而喻，我答应她绝不吐露真情，并尽力帮忙。

“于是我们一起去她家——路上我十分愤怒地听说，人们用一丁点儿钱就骗了这两位可怜的无知女人，我心头就无名火起，但是这更坚定了我帮助她们到底的决心。我们走上楼梯，刚按响门铃，就听见屋里老人愉快而响亮的声音：‘进来！进来！’凭着盲人敏锐的听觉，他一定听见我们上楼的脚步声了。

“‘由于急着要让您看他的宝贝，赫尔曼今天中午一点儿都没睡。’老夫人笑着说。她女儿一个眼神就让她知道我答应了她们的请求，老太太也就把心放下了。桌上铺了一大堆收藏夹，正在等待。盲人一触到我的手，就抓住我的手臂，把我按在沙发椅上，连寒暄话都没说。

“‘好吧，现在我们马上就开始！——要看的东西很多，而柏林来的大老板又没有时间！这里第一个收藏夹里全是大师丢勒的作品，您自己将会确信，收集得相当齐全——而且一幅比一幅精美。喏，看看吧，您自己来判断！’——说着他打开了画夹中的第一幅，‘这是《大马》。’

“于是他便精心细致地，就像人家平时触碰到一件易碎的东西似的，用指尖小心翼翼地从收藏夹里取出一个嵌了一张泛黄的空白纸的画框。他激情满怀地把这张分文不值的废纸举在面前，凝视着，足有几分钟之久，可是并没有真正看见。他张开双手狂喜地把这张白纸举到眼前，整个脸上呈现出一位观赏者迷人地凝神专注的表情。可是他两颗瞎了的僵滞的眼珠，突然闪闪发亮，出现一缕智慧之光——是纸的反光，还是内心的喜悦所造成？

“‘怎么样，’他自豪地说，‘您什么时候见过比这印得更好的画吗？每个细部的线条多么锐利，轮廓多么清晰——我把这张画同德累斯顿的那幅做过比较，德累斯顿那张就显得呆板、木讷多了。再来看看它的来头！这儿——’他把画翻了过来，用指甲丝毫不差地指着这张空白纸上的一些地方，以至我下意识地朝那儿看去，看那儿是否真有标识——‘您看，这儿是那格勒的收藏章，这里是雷米和埃斯戴尔的收藏章。这些著名收藏家大概怎么也料想不到，他们的画居然来到了这间小屋里。’

“听到这位毫不知情的老人如此热情地赞赏一张完全空白的纸，我真感到不寒而栗。看见他用指甲精确到毫米不差地指着只在他的幻想中还存在的看不见的收藏家的标识，真让人感到十分怪异，心里直发毛。恐怖使得我的喉咙感到憋气，像是被绳子勒住了似的，我不知道该怎么回答才好。我迷惘地抬眼看着那两个女人，看见浑身颤抖、异常激动的老夫人又举起了恳求的双手。于是我让自己镇静下来，开始进入我的角色。

“‘简直是超群绝伦！’我终于结结巴巴地说道，‘这幅画的印制真可谓精美无比！’自豪感使得老人的整个脸上立刻显得神采奕奕。‘不过，这还不怎么样，’他得意扬扬地说，‘您得先看看《忧愁》[13]，或者这幅《基督受难》[14]，这幅画色彩之绚丽，印制之精致，世上无出其右者。您看这儿，’说着他的手指又轻盈地抚摸着一幅他想象中的画，‘色彩鲜艳，质感强烈，色调温暖。柏林的大老板们和博物馆的专家们见了不被震得瞠目结舌，惊得呆若木鸡才怪呢。’

“老人得意扬扬，滔滔不绝地说啊，讲啊，足有两个小时。我真无法向您描述，跟他一起观赏这100张或200张空白废纸或是拙劣的复制品有多么怪异，多么吓人！这些子虚乌有的画在这位可悲的毫不知情的老人记忆里可是货真价实，真真切切的，他可以毫无差错地按照精确的顺序赞美和描述每一幅画，精确地指出画上的每一个细部。这些看不见的藏品早已风流云散，荡然无存了，可是对于这位盲人，对于这位令人感动的受骗者来说，还实实在在收藏在那里。还完整无缺地存在着。他由幻觉产生的激情是如此感人肺腑，几乎连我也开始相信了。只有一次，他似乎有所察觉，这下，他那梦游者的沉稳和观赏的热情就被可怕地打破了：拿起伦勃朗的《安提俄珀》（这是一幅试印张，想必确实具有无可估量的价值），他又赞赏了印刷的清晰，同时他那感觉敏锐的、神经质的手指深情地将这幅画复绘一遍，随后又照着印象中的线条重新描画时，他那久经磨炼的触角神经在这张陌生的画页上却没有发现那些凹纹。这时他额头上突然掠过一片阴影，声音也变得慌乱了。‘这确实是……确实是《安提俄珀》吗？’他喃喃自语，神情显得有些尴尬。我立刻心生一计，急忙从他手里将这幅装了框的画页拿了过来，热情洋溢地把这幅我也能记得起来的蚀刻画的各种细节描绘一番。盲人的那张已经变得尴尬的脸重新松弛下来。我越赞扬，这位性格怪僻、已到风烛残年的老者就越显得亲切与随和，快乐与真挚。‘这才是行家啊！’他朝他的家人转过脸去，兴高采烈地、得意扬扬地说。‘终于，终于找到一位知音了。你们听听他说的，我这些画有多值钱。你们总是对我心存疑虑，责怪我把所有的钱都花在了收藏上。这倒是真的，60年来，我不喝啤酒，不抽烟，不旅行，不看戏，不买书，总是一个劲儿省，省下钱来买了这些画。等到有朝一日我不在人世了，你们将会看到——你们发了，成了全城的首富，富得跟德累斯顿最有钱的富人一样，那时候，你们还会为我干的蠢事高兴的。可是只要我活着，一幅画也不许拿出这屋子——你们得先把我抬出去，这才能动我的藏品。’

“他边说边用手指轻柔地抚摸那些早已没有藏品的空收藏夹，就像是抚摸有生命的东西似的。——对我来说，这是一个可怕但又感人的情景，因为在这战争年代里，我还从未在一个德国人的脸上见过如此完美、如此纯真的幸福表情。他身旁站着他的妻子和女儿，神秘地跟那位德国大师蚀刻画上的女人形象[15]极为相似。画上的女人前来瞻仰救世主的坟墓，站在挖开的空墓穴前，脸上的表情既惊恐又虔诚，还有见到奇迹时的狂喜。犹如那幅画上的女门徒被救世主神的预示映得神采奕奕一样，这两个日渐衰老、含辛茹苦、家徒四壁的小市民妇女脸上则感染着老人那天真烂漫、心花怒放的欢乐，她们一面欢笑，一面流泪，这样感人至深的情景我还从未见过。可是，老人对我的夸奖真是百听不厌，他不断把画页堆起，又翻开，如饥似渴地把我说的每一句话都吞进肚里。等到最后，这些骗人的收藏夹被推到一边，老人很不乐意地得把桌子腾出来喝咖啡的时候，对我来说倒是一次休息。可是我这心含内疚的放松又怎能与这位似乎年轻了三十岁的老人，与他激越高昂、升腾跌宕的欢乐情绪，与他的豪迈气魄相提并论！他讲了千百个买画淘宝的趣闻逸事，一再站起身来，不要别人帮忙，自己摸索着去抽出一幅又一幅画来：他像喝了酒似的兴奋和陶醉。可是等我末了说，我得告辞了，他简直大为惊吓，像个任性的孩子似的一脸恼怒，固执地跺着脚说：这可不行，还没看完一半呢。两个女人费了好大周折才让这位倔强的老人明白，他不能让我多耽搁了，要不然就会误了火车。

“经过激烈反对，最后他终于顺从了。告别的时候到了，他的声音变得非常柔和。他握住我的两只手，他的手指以一个盲人的全部表达力，亲热地顺着我的手一直抚摸到手腕，像是想更多地了解我，并向我表达言语所不能表达的更多的爱。‘您的光临给了我极大、极大的快乐。’他开口说，语气中透着从内心激起的感触，这是我永远不会忘怀的，‘终于又能和一位行家一起来欣赏我心爱的藏画，对我来说这真是件欣慰的事。我会让您看到，您没有白到我这个瞎老头这儿来。我让我太太作为证人，我在这儿当着她的的面答应您，我要在我的遗嘱上再加上一条：委托您久负盛名的字号来拍卖我的收藏。您该获此殊荣，来管理这批人所不知的宝藏，’——说到这里，他深情地把手放在这些早已洗劫一空的收藏夹上——‘直到它流散到世界各地之日。不过您要答应我编制一份精美的藏品目录：让它成为我的墓碑，更好的墓碑我也不需要。’

“我望了望他夫人和女儿，她们俩紧紧地挨在一起，有时会有一阵战栗从一人传给另一个人，仿佛两人是一个身体，因为受到同样的心灵震撼而在那里颤抖。我自己的心情十分庄严，因为这位令人感动的毫不知情的老人，委托我像保管一批珍宝似的保管他那看不见的、早已散失的藏品。我深受感动，答应了这件我永远也无法完成的事；老人瞎了的眼珠又为之一亮，我感到，他从内心渴望感觉到我的真实存在：我从他的和蔼可亲，从他心怀感激和诺言，用手指紧握我的手指的举止上，感觉到了他的这种渴望。

“两位女人送我到门口。她们不敢说话，因为老人听觉敏锐，会听见每一句话，但是她们热泪盈眶，她们的目光注视着我，充满感激之情。我神情恍惚，摸索着走下楼梯。我心里感到十分羞愧：我像童话里的天使踏进一个穷人家里，帮人做了一次虔诚的欺骗，肆无忌惮地撒谎，使一个瞎子在一小时内重见光明，而实际上我确实是个卑鄙的商贩，到这里来是想从别人手里狡猾地捞取几件珍贵的东西。可是我带走的却很多很多：在这麻木迟钝、毫无欢乐的时代，我又一次生动地感觉到了纯真的激情，一种心灵里充满阳光、完全献身于艺术的心醉神迷——对于这种精神状态我们这些人似乎早已忘怀了。我心里充满敬畏之情，——我无法用别的方式来表达——虽然我还因为不知原因而一直感到羞惭。

“我已经到了大街上，这时上面的窗户咔喇一响，我听见有人在喊我的名字：真的，老人非要朝他估摸我所去的那个方向用他失明的眼睛为我送行。他的身子探出窗外老远，他的妻女只好扶着他，以防意外。他挥动手绢，用男孩子快乐而爽朗的声音叫道：‘一路平安！’这是一个令我难以忘怀的情景：楼上窗口上露出一张白发老人快乐的笑脸，由一片善意的幻觉之白云从我们这个可憎的现实世界轻轻托起，高临于大街上那些郁郁寡欢、行色匆匆、忙忙碌碌的人群之上。我不觉又想起了那句真实的老话——我想，那是歌德说的——‘收藏家是幸福的人！’”

书商门德尔


罗炜　译

我于外出访友之后重返维也纳，遇到一场倾盆大雨。雨一阵紧似一阵，犹如湿淋淋的鞭子，抽得人们急忙逃到屋檐下，或躲进能避雨的处所。我也急急忙忙寻一处躲雨的地方。幸好，时下维也纳的街头小巷到处都有咖啡馆在恭候客人的光临——于是，我就躲进马路正对面的那家，头上的礼帽已经开始往下流水，肩膀更是淋得透湿。从屋内的陈设来看，这家市郊咖啡馆并未脱离其传统的、近乎千篇一律的模式，没有市内那些仿效德国的音乐演奏场之类的新时髦，这里洋溢着老维也纳的市民气息，来此落座的全是平头百姓，他们对报纸的消费多于点心。现在正值傍晚时分，本已混浊的空气仿佛又带着蓝色的烟圈组成的厚厚的大理石花纹，尽管如此，崭新的丝绒沙发、发亮的铝制收款台使咖啡馆依然显得清爽而洁净。我进来时很匆忙，故而没去细看门口的招牌，就算知道它的店名又有何用呢？——此时，我暖暖和和地坐在咖啡馆里，目光穿过淋着雨水的蓝玻璃窗不耐烦地向外张望，只恨这恼人的大雨下个不停，使我无法继续向前赶几公里的路。

如此一来，我只好无所事事地坐在那里，开始陷入一种懒散的迟钝状态，每家真正的维也纳咖啡馆都看不见地散发着麻醉剂似的慵困气氛。由于这种空虚的感觉，我逐一打量着这里的每个人，烟雾缭绕之中的灯光给他们的眼睛画上了一道病态的灰圈。我注视着收款台后面的那位小姐，看她如何机械地给每杯咖啡放上糖和小匙，然后，分发给侍者端走。我半梦半醒，无意识地看着墙上那些极其无关的广告。这样的昏昏沉沉简直令人感到惬意。但忽然间，我奇怪地从半梦半醒状态中完全清醒过来，我的心里开始了一阵莫名其妙的躁动，就像一阵轻微的牙痛，且还搞不清楚疼痛是源于左边还是右边，上颌还是下颌，我只感到一阵模模糊糊的紧张，一种心灵的不安。突然间——我自己也不明白是什么原因——我意识到，自己数年前肯定来过这里。因为，我觉得这里的墙壁、椅子、桌子以及这间陌生而又烟雾弥漫的房子与我都有着联系。

然而，我越想把握住这个回忆就越不能如愿以偿，它似乎在有意地捉弄我，竟一溜烟地缩了回去——犹如一只水母，蛰伏于意识的最底层，闪烁不定，触不到，抓不着。我的眼睛徒劳无益地凝视着室内陈设的每一件物品。显然，有些东西我并不熟悉，比如收款台配备了叮当作响的自动收款机，墙上仿紫檀木的棕色贴面，这一切想必是后来才添置的。可是确实，确实，这里我二十多年前曾经来过，这里有那个早已消逝的“我”留下的什么东西，就像钉入木头之中的钉子，藏在看不见的地方。我猛的一下振作起来，调动浑身的每一个感官，同时在屋子里和自己心里搜寻着——但真是要了命了！我无法找回这失踪的记忆，它淹没在我的心海里了。

我对自己很气恼，正如由于一次失败，人们认识到精神的力量并非万能和十全十美的时候，往往会十分气恼一样。但我内心仍旧怀有还能找回这个记忆的一线希望。我知道，我只要有一只小钩子就够了，因为我的记性生来就十分特别，既好又坏，既倔强固执，又有难以描述的忠诚。无论大事小事还是各色人等，无论阅读所得还是亲身经历，只要是重要的，它都一股脑儿吞进它那幽黑的仓库里，单凭意志的召唤而不施加压力，是一丁点儿也不会从冥府似的黑暗的仓库里拿出来的。是的，我只需抓住溜得最快的那根线索，一张明信片，信封上的几行字，一份让烟给熏黑的报纸，刹那间，被遗忘的往事如同咬住钓钩的鱼儿，就会真切而实在地蹦出奔流的混浊的水面。我随即便会知道一个人身上的全部细节，他的嘴，嘴一笑便会露出左边因牙齿脱落而留下的窟窿，断断续续的笑声，颤动的胡子，以及在笑声中显露出来的另一副新面孔——这所有的一切随即便完全在幻觉之中浮现于我的眼前，我想起了多年以前这个人对我讲过的每一句话。然而，为了真切地看到和感受往事的存在，我仍需借助于感官的刺激和来自现实的微小的帮助。于是我便双目紧闭，好竭力地思索，用那只神秘的钓钩把往事钩出来。可我一无所获！再度一无所获！全都掩埋了，全都遗忘了！对于长在两个太阳穴之间的这台差劲的、固执的记忆机器我感到无比的愤怒，恨不得拿拳头打自己的脑袋，这就好比是一台失灵的自动售货机，任你怎么摇它，就是不把你买的东西输出来。不，我再不能无动于衷地坐等下去了，这种身体内部的失灵令我气愤至极，我怒气冲天地站起来发泄心中的不快。然而，奇怪的是——我刚在咖啡馆里抬起脚，第一线荧光便闪烁在我的脑海里。走到收款台的右边时，我想起来了，从那儿一定可以进入一间没有窗户、只用人造光源照明的屋子。真的，没错。就是这间屋子，这间轮廓显得模糊的长方形后屋。这间游戏室，虽然室内的装潢与以前不同了，但却仍旧保持了原来的布局。我下意识地逐一环顾四周的物品，神经已开始欢乐起舞（我觉得自己马上就会知道一切了）。屋里两张台球桌闲置着，好似无声的绿色沼泽，墙角摆着几张牌桌，其中的一张是两位枢密官或教授下棋的桌子。而在紧挨铁炉的那个角落里，也就是到电话间去的地方，有一张小方桌。此时此刻，我终于彻底地顿悟了。我心里一热，高兴得全身一阵震颤，立即就想起来了：天啊，这可是门德尔，雅各布·门德尔，书商门德尔的位置啊！事隔二十年之后，我居然又重新来到了他的大本营——坐落在上阿尔泽街的格鲁克咖啡馆。雅各布·门德尔，我怎么会把他忘了那么久呢，真是不可思议，这个最最奇怪的人，这个富于传奇色彩的人，这个古怪的世界奇迹，在大学校园和敬仰他的那个圈子里是遐迩闻名的——他是图书魔术师和经纪人，他每天从早到晚坐在这里，从不间断，他是知识的象征，格鲁克咖啡馆的荣耀，我怎么会把他忘得一干二净呢！

顷刻间，他那清晰无误、栩栩如生的形象就出现在我的面前。我立刻真切地看到了他，他一如既往地坐在那张小方桌旁，脏兮兮的灰色大理石桌面上任何时候都堆满了书籍和杂志。他坚持不懈地坐在那里，毫不动摇。目光透过镜片像着了魔似的死死盯在一本书上，他坐在那里读书，口中叽里咕噜地念出声来，身体和未加精心修饰的、斑斑点点的秃头一起前后摇晃。这是他在东方犹太小学上学时养成的习惯。他待在这张桌子旁而且只在这张桌子旁阅读他的目录和书籍，正如犹太教法典学校的老师们教他的那样，小声地诵读，轻微地晃动着身子，好似一只荡来荡去的黑色摇篮。孩子通过这种有节奏的、施催眠术似的来回晃动，进入梦乡。因此，在那些虔诚的教徒们看来，懒散的身体通过自己的摇摆晃动，精神也就容易达到专心致志的境界。事实上，这位雅各布·门德尔对发生在他周围的任何事情均一律视而不见，充耳不闻。就在他旁边，打台球的人在大声喧哗吵闹，台球计分员跑前跑后，电话也叮零零地响个不停；有人忙着擦地，有人忙着生炉子，而他却毫无察觉。有一次，一个烧得通红的煤球从炉子里滚落出来，燃着了离他仅两步之远的镶木地板，冒起了黑烟，而且还有焦煳味，等到一位顾客闻到刺鼻的焦味，发现了危险，快步冲过来，急忙把火弄灭了才算了事，而雅各布·门德尔本人虽已为烟雾所困，却跟什么都没发生似的毫无感觉。他看书的时候就像别人祈祷、打台球以及喝醉酒的人两眼茫然望天发呆那样，其痴迷程度令我非常感动，以至于我日后所见的任何人读书的神态都显得极其一般。作为年轻人，我第一次在雅各布·门德尔这位矮小的加里西亚[1]的旧书商身上看到了那种全神贯注的巨大的奥妙，正是它造就了艺术家、学者，真正的智慧和完完全全的疯子，这种对书本的着魔给人带来了多少悲怆的幸福与不幸啊！

我同他的初次相识是经由大学里一位年长同事的引荐。我当时正致力于研究即使今天也不大为人熟知的帕拉切尔苏斯[2]派医生兼催眠术家梅斯梅尔[3]，但遗憾的是，收效甚微。因无法弄到有关的著作，我这涉世不深的新手便跑去找图书管理员帮忙，他却毫不客气地对我说了一通，称查找参考文献是我的事，他不管。这样，我的那位同事第一次对我提起了他的名字。他说：“我带你去找门德尔。”他向我许诺说：“他无所不知、无所不能，他可以从一家被人忘却的德文旧书店里为你找出最冷门的书来。他不仅是维也纳最能干的人，而且还是个怪人，是书籍领域里的一只濒临绝种的远古巨型爬行动物。”

于是，我们两人来到格鲁克咖啡馆，只见书商门德尔正坐在老地方，戴着眼镜，胡子拉碴，黑衣黑裤，摇晃着身子在念书，仿佛微风中的一簇黝黑的灌木丛。我们走到他的跟前，他也没有发觉。他只顾坐在那里念书，宝塔般的上身来回晃荡于桌子的上方，他那破旧的黑色双排扣大衣也在身后的衣帽钩上摇摆，口袋里塞满了杂志和卡片。我的朋友大声咳了几下，以向对方通报我们来了。但门德尔仍然毫不知觉，所戴眼镜的厚厚镜片已贴着书本子。最后，我的朋友像敲门似的使劲猛敲桌面——门德尔总算抬起头来凝视我们，他将笨重的金属镶边眼镜机械而迅速地往额头上一推，两道灰白色的眉毛竖了起来，眉毛下露出一双奇怪的眼睛，直瞪瞪地看着我们。那是一双黑色而警觉的小眼睛，敏捷、锐利，犹如蛇的舌头。我的朋友把我介绍给门德尔。我随即向他说明了我的请求。我首先——我的朋友执意让我采用这样的计谋——做出愤愤不已的样子，将那位不愿为我提供帮助的图书管理员狠狠抱怨了一顿。门德尔把身子往回靠了靠，小心翼翼地吐了一口唾沫。接着，他淡淡地一笑，操着浓重的东方口音说道：“他不愿意帮忙？不——他是没有能耐！他是外行，是头斗败的灰毛驴子。我认识他，真可惜，整整二十年了，可他直到今日仍不学无术。他们这号人只会领钱拿薪水！这帮博士大人，最好让他们去搬砖头，别让他们坐在书桌旁边。”

随着这番激烈的倾吐，坚冰也就打破了。他做了一个友善的手势，第一次请我坐在这张上面记满了各种事情的大理石方桌旁。坐在在此之前对我来说还是陌生的、向爱书人宣谕的祭坛旁，我赶紧不失时机地表明了自己的愿望：我想知道，与梅斯梅尔同时代人的有关磁力学的著作以及后人支持和反对梅斯梅尔的全部书籍和争论文章。我刚把话讲完，门德尔的左眼便眯缝了一下，像个瞄准目标就要射击的射手。不过，这一注意力高度集中的姿势确确实实只持续了一秒钟。紧接着他便迅速而流利地说出了二三十本书名，仿佛在念一张无形的图书目录似的，连每本书的出版地点、出版年月和大致的价格均说得清清楚楚。我惊得目瞪口呆。虽然思想上早有准备，结果仍旧出乎我的意料之外。不过，我的惊讶似乎让他感到惬意。因为，他旋即就在自己记忆的键盘上弹奏起关于我的主题的神奇书目变奏曲来了。他问我，是否也想了解一下梦游者的情况，了解一下催眠术的最初试验情况以及与加斯纳[4]驱魔术、基督教科学派[5]和勃拉瓦茨基[6]有关的情况？于是，他把人名、书名和内容描述再次如数家珍般地娓娓道来。此时此刻我才明白，我遇到的这位雅各布·门德尔是个记忆力无与伦比的奇才，确实是有两条腿的百科词典和包罗万象的图书目录。我迷迷糊糊地目不转睛地凝视着眼前的这位衣着寒酸甚至有些油污的加里西亚小个子书商，这个图书目录界的奇才。他在一口气举出约莫八十本书名之后，表面上装得毫不经意，实则内心颇为得意地拿起一块原本或许是白色的手绢擦擦眼镜。为了稍稍掩饰一下自己的诧异，于是我便怯生生地问他，这些书目中有哪几本他肯定能够弄到。“这个嘛，看看能搞到多少吧。”他喃喃地说道，“您明天再来一趟好了，我门德尔是会为您搞到一些的，东家没有西家有嘛。世上无难事，只怕有心人。”我彬彬有礼地表示感谢。可是，由于一味忙于客套而干了一桩大蠢事：我向他建议，把我想要的书写在一张纸条上。我的朋友在一旁见状赶紧用胳膊肘捅了我一下，以示警告。可是太迟了！门德尔已经向我投来了一瞥——这是怎样的一瞥啊！——既得意又感到受了屈辱，既讥讽又傲慢，简直就跟莎士比亚笔下高贵的君王、不可战胜的英雄麦克白投向不自量力、要他束手就擒的敌人麦克道夫那威严的一瞥一模一样。然后，他又笑了几声，脖子上的大喉结引人注目地上下滚动，仿佛艰难地咽下了一句粗话似的。不过，就算善良、正直的门德尔说出什么最最粗鲁的话来，那也自有他的道理。因为，只有不了解情况的人才会斗胆给他——雅各布·门德尔提出如此侮辱性的要求，要他写下书名，拿他当书店里的学徒或图书管理员看待，好像这个金刚钻般的无可比拟的脑袋什么时候需要过这种低劣的辅助手段似的。日后我才明白，自己当时出于礼貌而提的建议对这个古怪的天才的伤害该是多么重啊！因为雅各布·门德尔，这位衣衫不整、胡子拉碴、弯腰驼背、身材矮小的犹太人是记忆王国里的巨子。他灰白、肮脏并已长了老年斑的额头后面，好似有种看不见的文字把平素印在书籍封面上的每本书名，每个人名，都用钢水浇铸在那里一般。无论是昨天还是二百年前出版的新旧书籍，他全都了如指掌，均能准确无误地记得每本书的装帧、插图及其再版，任何作品，不管是他接触过的，还是从橱窗或图书馆里见到过的，他都看得清清楚楚，正如跟艺术家在创作时能清楚地看到自己内心中的别人看不见的形象一样。倘若累根斯堡一家旧书店的书目上标出某本书的价格是六马克，他便能马上记起，该书的另一个版本两年前曾在维也纳的一次拍卖中仅以四克朗成交，而且还记得当时的买主。是的，雅各布·门德尔从不忘记一个书名、一个数字，他熟悉图书世界这个永远动荡、不停翻转的宇宙里的每一株植物，每一只纤毛虫和每一颗星星。他的知识比各个专业的专家还要渊博，他对图书馆的精通胜过图书管理员，他凭借自己神奇的记忆力，对绝大多数图书公司的库存一清二楚，而它们的老板即使借助于一大堆纸条和卡片也望尘莫及。他之所以能如此，不是别的，正是那记忆的魔力，正是那无可比拟、只可用成百上千个实例来加以真实体现的记忆力。当然，这种记忆要训练和培养到如此正确无误的神奇的程度，永恒的秘诀只有一个：全神贯注。这也是任何追求完美造诣的秘诀。一旦走出书的天地，这个怪人对世界便一无所知。对他而言，全部的生活现象只有在被转换成铅字并被汇集到一本书里之后，才算得上是真实的存在。就拿这些书来说吧，即便他读它们，那也不是在读它们的意义、它们的精神内涵和情节，能唤起他的热情的仅仅只是书名、价格、样式以及封面。成百上千个书名和人名的索引铭刻在一只哺乳动物柔软的大脑皮层里，而非如平素那样写进图书目录之中，仅此而已，既无生产性，也无创造性。然而，就其盖世无双的完美无瑕来看，雅各布·门德尔对古旧书籍的特殊记忆力作为奇迹绝不亚于拿破仑对人的外表，梅佐方梯斯[7]对于语言，拉斯克[8]对国际象棋的开局，布索尼[9]对音乐的记忆力。如果请他去讲课或担任某个公职，这颗脑袋定会令成千上万的学生和学者在深受教诲之余感到震惊，它不仅使科学受益，而且也给我们称之为图书馆的公共宝库带来无可比拟的好处。可是，对于他这个矮小的、没有受过什么教育的，顶多只上过犹太小学的加里西亚的书商来说，上层社会的大门永远是关闭的。如此一来，他神奇的想象力就只能在格鲁克咖啡馆的那张大理石桌旁作为秘密学科发挥作用了。不过，等到有朝一日，有位伟大的心理学家降临人世时（我们的思想界还始终缺乏这样的巨匠），像布封[10]整理和分类那样，耐心而顽强地把我们称之为记忆力的这种神奇力量进行研究，将其种类、特点、原始形态及其变体逐一加以描述和说明的时候，他肯定不会漏掉雅各布·门德尔这位记忆书名及其价格的天才，这位古籍旧书学科里的无名大师。

就其职业来说，不知底里的人自然只会把雅各布·门德尔当作一个小书贩。每逢星期天，《新自由报》和《新维也纳日报》就会登出内容千篇一律的广告：“求购旧书，出价最高，随叫随到，门德尔，上阿尔泽大街”，接下来是电话号码，其实这是格鲁克咖啡馆的电话。他在书库里翻来找去，每周都要带上一个留大胡子的老伙计，两人一同把新收购到的书拖回到他的大本营，然后再从那里把书卖出去。由于他没有进行正规图书交易的正式许可证，故而一直干着小本买卖，获利甚微。大学生们把用过的教科书卖给他，经他转手，这些书从高年级传给低年级，此外，他还给人介绍和购买所需的作品，只收取极少的手续费。人们花很少的钱就可以从他那里得到不错的建议。不过，金钱在他的世界里并未占据一席之地。人们所看到的他永远都是那副老样子：总是穿着那套洗得退了颜色的衣服，早晨、下午和晚上全是啃两个面包，喝点牛奶了事，中午随便吃点人家替他从小饭馆里端来的东西。他不吸烟，也不爱玩，可以说他简直没有活着，唯有镜片后面的一双眼睛是活着的，它源源不断地用单词、书名和人名去喂那谜一般的东西——大脑。而那柔软的、可怕的物质则贪婪地把这些东西吸进去，如同久旱的草原上的草吸入成千上万滴雨水一样。他对各色人等不感兴趣，至于常人所有的种种欲求，也许他只知道一种，当然还是最最合乎人性的那一种——虚荣。如果有人在踏破铁鞋无觅处之后跑来向他请教，而他又能当即解此人的燃眉之急，那么，仅此一项才会令他感到快乐和满足，或许还有一件事，那就是维也纳城里城外有那么几十人尊重和需要他的知识。在每个硕大无朋的、我们称之为大城市的百万人口密集的岩体里，某些地方总免不了会蹦出几个小小的多棱镜来，它们用自己那微小的平面折射着这同一个宇宙。可是，绝大多数人却忽略了它们的存在，只有了解和热爱它们的行家，才懂得去珍视它们。图书业内的这帮行家里手没有不知道雅各布·门德尔的。正如有人要请教一段乐谱，便去音乐之友协会找奥泽比乌斯·曼季舍夫斯基帮忙一样，他头戴灰色小帽，置身于手稿与乐谱之中，为人热情友善，只要抬起眼睛，再困难的问题他也会伴随着微笑给予解决的。这又好比现在的人们，要想了解旧维也纳的戏剧与文化，就去请教格罗西大爷，同样，维也纳的几个坚定执着的爱书人，只要遇上什么特别的难题，他们必定信心十足地前往格鲁克咖啡馆请门德尔赐教。亲眼目睹门德尔如何为人排忧解难，更使我这个好奇的年轻人心中油然而生一种特殊的快感。如果递到他面前的是本无甚价值的书，他往往只把封面一合，嘀咕一声：“两克朗。”相反，如果送来的是某种珍本或孤本，他就肃然起敬，拿张纸来垫在下面，但见他刹那间面呈愧色，仿佛为自己脏兮兮、沾满墨迹的黑指甲感到难堪。然后，他小心翼翼地满怀异乎寻常的敬重之情，逐页逐页地翻看那稀世珍宝。此时此刻，无人能够惊动他，正如真正虔敬的教徒在祈祷时，谁也无法打搅他一样。说真的，他对书的端详、触摸、嗅闻和掂量，他所做的每一个细微的动作，无不体现着某种严守礼仪的意味，连先后顺序也严格按照宗教仪式上的规定。他那驼背摇来晃去，他的手挠着头发，口里叽里咕噜地冒出一连串奇怪的感叹词。先是一声长长的、大惊小怪的“啊”和“哦”，用以表示极度的赞赏；但当他发现某处缺张少页或被蠢虫蛀了时，便又惋惜地发出一阵“哎”或“哎呀”的惊叫来。最后，他充满敬意地将这本旧书放在手里掂了又掂，眯缝着眼睛，把鼻子伸到这个笨重的方块上面又闻又嗅，那种痴迷劲一点也不亚于多愁善感的女孩对晚香玉的怜爱。毋庸置疑，书的主人在这一不无烦琐的鉴定过程中必须具备足够的耐心。不过，检验结束之后，门德尔准保总会十分乐意甚至是兴奋不已地提供各种情况，少不了要东拉西扯地讲一些有关该书类似版本的逸事和价格方面的戏剧性变化。每到此时，他似乎变得开朗，变得年轻，变得活泼了，唯有一样事情会使他感到气愤：那就是某个初次打交道的人想要为他的这番评论支付报酬的时候。这时，他会十分屈辱地躲到一边去，就像画廊顾问在给来旅游的美国人做了一番讲解之后拒绝塞在他手里的小费一样。因为，在门德尔看来，得以亲手触摸一本宝贵的书，就像别人同女人的肌肤相亲。这样的时刻，是他柏拉图式的情爱之夜。只有书可以左右他，金钱对他永远无能为力。因此，好些大收藏家，其中包括普林斯顿大学的创始人，都曾想请他到他们图书馆来当顾问和采购员，但他们全是枉费心机——雅各布·门德尔拒绝了他们的美意。离开了格鲁克咖啡馆，他的生活就不堪设想。三十三年前，他离开东方，到维也纳来学习，想成为犹太教经师。当时，他还只是一个刚刚长出黑绒绒的胡子、头发曲鬈的猥琐的小伙子。可没过多久，他就离开了严厉的单一神耶和华，皈依形形色色的图书众神门下。那时，格鲁克咖啡馆是他最先找的落脚地。渐渐地，这里成为他的作坊，他的大本营，他的邮局，他的世界。就像一位天文学家，每晚孤独地坚守在自己的观象台上，通过望远镜的小圆孔观察夜空中的数不尽的星星，观察它们神秘莫测的运行，它们的纷繁交织、变化无定，它们的消失和重新闪现。雅各布·门德尔则是在这张方桌旁通过自己的那双戴了眼镜的眼睛，向另外一个也在同样永恒地运转着的空间眺望那个书籍的宇宙，我们世界之上的世界。

不用说，格鲁克咖啡馆的人都很敬重他。在我的眼里，该咖啡馆的荣誉更多的来自那张看不见的无形的讲台，而非来自《阿尔塞斯特》及《伊菲革涅亚》的作曲家、高贵的音乐家——克里斯托夫·维利巴尔德·格鲁克[11]的名字。他是这里的一件不可或缺的摆设，早已和那古老的樱桃木收款台、两张大修过的台球桌以及那把煮咖啡的铜咖啡壶融为一体，而他的桌子也得到类似圣物般的呵护。他有为数众多的顾客和前来求教的人，每次一来，店里的服务员就热情地敦促他们随便喝点什么。于是，他的学问本该赚取的钱，大部分实则装进了领班多依布勒那只挂在髋部的大皮包里。书商门德尔也因此得到诸多优厚的待遇。电话供他免费使用，有人为他保存信件，代订各种书刊。打扫厕所的忠厚女工帮他缝扣子、刷大衣，每星期还替他把一包脏衣服送到洗衣店去。只有他一个人可以享用别人替他到邻近饭馆里端来的午餐。老板斯坦德哈特纳先生每天早晨都要亲自走到桌前跟他打声招呼。当然，在大多数情况下，门德尔只顾着埋头看书，根本没有听见人家对他的问候。他每天早晨七点半准时走进这里，一直待到熄灯打烊方才离去。他从不和别的客人讲话，也不看报纸，世上的任何变化皆与他无关。有次，斯坦德哈特纳先生客气地问他，在电灯下看书是否比以前在暗淡、摇曳的煤气灯下看书要舒服些。他这才惊讶地抬头望着电灯泡发愣：对这一经过数日敲打折腾安装调试才得以实现的变化，他居然毫无察觉。唯有那黑纤毛虫般数不清的文字被那两只圆圆的镜片和那两个拼命吮吸着的发光晶状体过滤到他的大脑里，其余的一切都好似毫无意义的喧哗从他的身边消失。其实，在长达三十多年的时间里，也就是说在他精力充沛的岁月里，完全是在这里的这张方桌旁以阅读、比较和计算的方式中度过的，仿佛持续不停地做着一个永恒的、只为睡觉打断的长梦。

因此，当我看见雅各布·门德尔当年用以为人解答疑难的那张大理石方桌空空地宛如一块墓碑摆在这间屋子里时，心头不禁掠过一种恐惧。只到现在，自己年纪渐渐大了，我方才明白，有多少东西随着每个像门德尔这样的人的消失而消失了，尤其是在我们这个无可救药地变得越来越单调的世界里，所有独一无二的事物都显得日渐珍贵了。我当时还是一个不谙世事的年轻人，但凭借某种心灵的直觉，深深地喜欢上了这位雅各布·门德尔。而我居然会把他忘掉——当然是在战火纷飞的年代里[12]，是在对自己的创作投入像他那样的忘我精神进行工作的情况下。此时此刻，面对这张空荡荡的桌子，我感到自己有愧于它，同时，一股被它重新激起的好奇也从心底生发出来。

他究竟去了哪里呢？他到底出了什么事呢？我叫来侍从，向他打听。没有。他遗憾地表示，我不认识一个叫门德尔的先生，我们咖啡馆没有姓门德尔的先生来过。不过，领班也许知道。后者挺着个大肚子，慢腾腾地走了过来，迟疑片刻后思忖道：不知道。他也不认识一个叫门德尔的先生。不过，他说，我指的也许是曼德尔先生，即弗罗里安尼胡同里那个卖缝纫用品的曼德尔先生？我只觉得心头涌起一阵苦涩，感叹人生如过眼烟云：如果我们最后的足迹都已被脚后的风吹掉了，人活着还有什么意义？三十年了，也许是四十年，有个人在这几平方米的空间里呼吸、阅读、思考、说话，而仅仅只过了三四年，新法老上台，从此约瑟便没了音讯，格鲁克咖啡馆的人便再也不知道雅各布·门德尔，书商门德尔的情况了。我近乎恼怒地问领班，我是否可以找斯坦德哈特纳先生谈一谈，或者找在这里干了好多年的老伙计也行？哦，斯坦德哈特纳先生，天哪，他早就把这家咖啡店给卖掉了，他本人也已去世。那个老领班现住在克雷姆斯附近的庄园里。不，没有什么人在了……对了！对了——斯波席尔太太还在，就是那个扫厕所的女佣（人称巧克力老太）。但她肯定也不会记得起每一位顾客来了。我立刻说出自己的看法：雅各布·门德尔是不会被人忘记的，去替我把她找来吧。

斯波席尔太太顶着一头乱蓬蓬的白发，迈着有些水肿的双腿，走出了她那隐秘的工作场所，她还急急忙忙地拿着一条毛巾揩着通红的双手。显然，她刚才不是在清扫她的那间阴暗的小屋，就是在擦窗子。她显得有些手足无措，这使我马上意识到：如此突兀地把她叫到这家咖啡馆里高雅的场所，让大电灯泡照着，这令她很不自在。因此，她一开始便采取不信任的态度，小心翼翼地用眼睛从下而上地偷偷地打量着我。我又凭什么要她善待于我呢？然而，我刚一张口问起雅各布·门德尔的情况，她那双瞪得圆圆的、溢满泪水的眼睛便盯在了我的脸上，肩膀开始一阵阵抽搐。“老天爷啊，可怜的门德尔先生，竟然还会有人惦念着他！是呀，可怜的门德尔先生！”——她几乎感动得哭出声来了。老年人在有人提及他们的青春时代或某个美好的但却遗忘了的共同经历过的事情的时候，大都会变成这副样子的。我问他是否还活着。“哦，老天爷呀，可怜的门德尔先生肯定在五六年前，不，七年前就已经去世了。那真是个和气的好人啊。我想，我认识他的时间很长了，二十五年多了呀。我进店的时候，他早就来了。他们用那种方法害死他，真是可耻。”她越说越激动，还问我是不是他的亲戚。说实话，从来就没人关心过他，打听过他。她问我知不知道他究竟出了什么事？

不知道，我向她保证，我一无所知，并请她把事情的全部经过都告诉我。善良的老人显得有些胆怯和顾忌，她又开始用毛巾去擦她那双湿手。我明白了：厕所清洁工的身份，戴着肮脏的围裙，顶着一头乱蓬蓬的白发，置身于咖啡馆大堂里，令她感到难堪。此外，她还老是胆怯地环顾左右，看有没有侍从在偷听我们的谈话。于是，我向她提议，我们最好到游戏室门德尔的老地方那里去，并请她在那里把一切都告诉我。她感动得点头表示同意，并谢谢我善解人意。老太太在前，走起路来已经不大稳当，我紧随其后。那两个侍从向我们投来诧异的目光，他们觉出准有什么事，几个客人也惊奇地看着我们这两个年龄差别悬殊的人。我们来到门德尔的桌边之后，她向我讲述了雅各布·门德尔，书商门德尔走向毁灭的经过（部分细节我事后通过其他途径得到补充）。

事情是这样的，她说，他每天早上总是七点半来咖啡馆，即使战争爆发以后也不例外。一进屋就跟往常那样坐在老地方整天埋头研究。大家都感觉到并还常常议论说，他可能压根儿就不知道已经在打仗了。我知道，他从不看报纸，也不和别人说话。每逢卖报的吆喝着叫卖号外时，别人全都抢着去买，他却从未站起来过或用耳朵去听过。侍从弗兰茨（他是在戈尔利采[13]附近阵亡的）不见了，他也毫无觉察，斯坦德哈特纳先生的儿子在普热梅希尔[14]附近被俘，他一点都不知道，面包变得越来越难吃，他喝的只是用无花果制成的代用咖啡而不再是牛奶了，但他对此却没说过一句怨言。只有一次，他十分惊讶地发现，现在来访的大学生怎么这样少，仅此而已。——“老天爷呀，这可怜的人儿，除了他的书，任何别的事都不能叫他高兴，叫他发愁。”

可是，后来有一天，不幸的事情发生了。上午十一点，一个大晴天，一名警官带着个秘密警察进来问，有没有一个名叫雅各布·门德尔的人经常在我们这里出入，那秘密警察还亮了亮扣眼里的玫瑰花徽章。他们随即走到门德尔的桌旁，而后者还天真地以为，他们有书要卖或者有求于他。可是，他们立即要他跟他们走一趟，他就这样被带走了。这可真是咖啡馆有史以来的奇耻大辱。所有在场的人都走过来，围着可怜的门德尔先生。他站在两个警察之间，眼镜架在头发下面，眼睛不停地来回打量这两个人，弄不清他们究竟想要干什么。不过，她本人曾对那警官说，这肯定是个误会，门德尔先生可是个连只苍蝇也舍不得拍死的人呀。但那秘密警察马上大声呵斥，说她无权干涉他们执行公务。然后，他们把他带走了，很长时间他没有再露面，足有两年之久。她说，直到今天她仍搞不清楚，他们当时想从他身上得到什么。“但我敢对法官起誓，”老太太激动地说道，“门德尔先生是不会干坏事的。他们一定弄错了，我愿意为他作担保。这样对待一个可怜的、无辜的人，那简直是犯罪，是犯罪！”

善良的、令人感动的斯波席尔太太是对的。她令我大为感动。我们的朋友雅各布·门德尔的确没有做过任何坏事，但却干了一桩特殊的、令人感动的、即使是在那个疯狂的时代也全无可能的蠢事（全部细节我是后来才了解到的），之所以会这样，这只能解释为他对自己专业的彻底迷恋和不食人间烟火的生活方式。事情的经过是：负责监视与国外通邮的军事检查机关有一天截获了一张由某个叫雅各布·门德尔的人书写并署名的明信片，邮票已按规定贴足。但是，令人难以置信的是明信片是寄往敌国法国的，是寄给巴黎格雷涅尔沿河大街的书商让·拉波戴尔的。这个叫雅各布·门德尔的家伙在信上抱怨说，他虽已预付了全年的订费，却没有收到最近的八期《法国图书通报》。这张明信片落到一个下级检查官手里。此人身着蓝色战时后备军军服，一点也看不出他应征入伍前原是文科中学教师，个人爱好罗曼语言文学[15]。他觉得十分奇怪，心想，这是谁开的愚蠢的玩笑。他每周都要检查两千封信件，以找出可疑的文字和有间谍之嫌的措辞，但如眼前所见的这般荒唐事倒真还从未碰见过。居然有人胆敢无所顾忌地在信上署上自己的姓名、地址，从奥地利寄往法国，怡然自得地把一张寄往交战国去的明信片随手往邮筒里一扔，好像自一九一四年以来边界上并没有铁丝网严密封锁起来，法国、德国、奥地利和俄国在上帝创造的每个日子里也没有各自失去几千名男性公民似的。因此，他起初只把这件古怪的东西塞进写字桌的抽屉，并未向上级汇报这件荒唐事。可是，几周之后又来了一张由同一个雅各布·门德尔写的明信片，是寄给伦敦霍尔伯广场书商约翰·阿尔德里奇的，询问能否帮忙购买最后几期《古董杂志》，而且署的仍是那个雅各布·门德尔的名字，他还写了自己的详细地址，其天真无邪之状着实令人感动。如此一来，那位穿上了军服的文科中学教师可是有点坐不住了。这愚蠢的玩笑背后难道隐藏着什么不可告人的密码？于是，他站起身来，“啪”的一下把双脚后跟一并，向少校行了一个军礼，把两张明信片放到了少校的桌上。少校耸起肩膀说道：怪事！他首先通知警察局，要他们查一下是否真有雅各布·门德尔这个人。一小时以后，雅各布·门德尔便已落网。他对这突如其来的事情还莫名其妙，就稀里糊涂地被人带到了少校面前。少校拿出那两张神秘的明信片，问是不是他寄的。问话时的那种严厉的腔调，特别是因为他正读一份重要的图书目录时被打扰了，这使门德尔非常愤怒，态度近乎粗暴地吼道，这两张明信片当然是他写的。他说，付钱订了刊物，去索要的权利还是有的吧。坐在沙发椅上的少校身子一斜，侧向邻桌的少尉。两人会意地眨了眨眼睛：一个十足的傻瓜！接着，少校在心中盘算，是狠狠地把这个傻瓜训斥一顿就赶走完事呢，还是认真对待这件事。这类机关在遇到类似这种进退两难的尴尬情况时，几乎全都会决定先搞份备忘录再说。有个记录总不会错的。既于事无补，也于事无害，只不过是几百万张故纸堆里又多了一张写满不痛不痒之文字的纸片罢了。

然而，这一回却害了一个可怜的、蒙在鼓里的人。因为，在第二个问题开始时，厄运便已降临。他们首先要他报出自己的名字：雅各布，全名是贾因克夫·门德尔。职业：小商贩（他没有书商许可证，只有小贩证）。第三个问题导致了灾难：出生地。雅各布·门德尔说，出生在彼特里考附近的一个小地方。少校的眉毛竖了起来。彼特里考，这地方不就在离边境不远的俄属波兰境内吗？可疑！非常可疑！于是，他更为严厉地讯问，他是在何时获得奥地利国籍的。门德尔的眼睛惊诧地盯住他，目光暗淡：他不太明白。问他是否有证件，是在什么时候有的？他说，他只有小贩证，并没有别的证件。少校的眉头皱得越来越紧，要他务必讲清楚他的国籍到底是怎么一回事。他的父亲是干什么的，是奥地利人还是俄国人？雅各布·门德尔不慌不忙地答道：当然是俄国人。那他自己呢？啊呀，他本人已在三十年前就偷越俄国边境，一直生活在维也纳。少校愈发不安起来，问他，什么时候在此取得奥地利国籍的？门德尔反问道，问这干吗呢？他说，他从未关心过这类问题。这样看来，他仍是俄国公民啰？门德尔的心早已忍受不了这类乏味的问题了，他无所谓地回答道：“本来就是嘛。”

少校大惊失色，猛地将身子往后一仰，沙发椅随即发出咯吱咯吱的声响。原来真有其事啊！在一九一五年岁末的塔尔努夫战役[16]和大反攻之后的战争时期，一个俄国人居然可以在奥地利首都维也纳的城里自由自在地晃荡、无所顾忌地往法国和英国邮信，而警察局居然不闻不问。眼下，新闻界的那帮蠢驴正为康拉德·冯·霍岑道夫[17]没能立刻向华沙推进感到纳闷，总参谋部的人也感到奇怪，为什么部队的每次行动被间谍报告了俄国。这时少尉也站起身来，走到桌旁，原先的谈话变成了审讯。他们问他，作为外国人，为什么不立即去登记？门德尔还是没有回过神来，仍用他那唱歌般的犹太腔调答道：“我干吗要突然跑去登记呢？”少校认为，门德尔的反问是在向他们挑战，于是便用威胁的口气问他，看过通告没有？没有！连报纸也没有看过吗？没有！

由于紧张，雅各布·门德尔已经开始浑身冒汗，少校和少尉目不转睛地盯着他，好像他们的办公室里来了个外星人似的。随后便响起了拨电话的声音和打字机的吧嗒声，传令兵们跑进跑出。接着，雅各布·门德尔便被移送到驻地的部队监狱。后来，再由他们押往集中营。当他们命令他跟那两个士兵一起走的时候，他的两只眼睛还莫名其妙地直发愣。他不明白，他们想从他口里得到什么，他可是从来不识愁滋味的。那个戴着金色领章、说话粗鲁的家伙对他到底怀有什么恶毒的企图呢？他那书籍的高层世界里没有战争，没有误解，只有对数字和词汇、人名和书名的永恒的无休无止的求知欲。于是，他心平气和地夹在两名士兵之间走下楼去。直到警察局的人搜走了他大衣口袋里的几本书，并强行要他交出塞满百来张重要纸条及顾客地址的信夹时，他方才开始暴跳如雷地护住自己的东西，不让拿走。他们不得不拿绳子将他捆住。遗憾的是，他的眼镜，那使他得以眺望精神世界的魔镜，也不幸地于同一时刻落在地上摔成了碎片。两天之后，他身穿单薄的夏装，被押往科莫伦附近的一个专收俄国平民俘虏的集中营。

在以后的两年里，雅各布·门德尔远离自己心爱的书籍，身无分文，夹杂在这座巨大牢狱里那些冷漠、粗鲁、基本上是文盲的难友中间，被迫与他那超凡脱俗的、独一无二的书籍世界分离，就像折断了翅膀的雄鹰同超越尘世的苍穹隔绝那样。他在这所集中营里遭受到怎样的精神痛苦和肉体折磨——我们由于缺乏证人而不得而知。然而，从自身的疯狂之中清醒过来的世界已经逐渐地认识到，在这场战争所造成的全部残暴与罪孽里，最无意义、不明智，从而也最为道德所不能饶恕的，莫过于用铁丝网和高墙把那些无辜的早已过了工作年龄的平民集中囚禁起来。他们旅居在一个陌生的国家，并把那里当作故乡生活了多年，只因笃信客居的权利，笃信这种即便通古斯人[18]和阿劳干人[19]也恪守的神圣权利，因而耽误了及时出逃的机会——这是对文明的犯罪，无论是在法国、德国，还是在英国，乃至在我们疯狂的欧洲的每一寸土地上，都同样荒唐地犯下了这样的罪行。倘若不是一个真正奥地利式的偶然情况在那千钧一发之际，使他又重新回到他的世界的话，那么，雅各布·门德尔也许已像成百上千被围困在这堵高墙之内的无辜者那样变得精神失常，或者早在痢疾、虚弱和心灵的创伤等多重折磨下悲惨地走到了生命的尽头。原来，自门德尔失踪之后，常有一些地位显赫的顾客屡屡写信找他：如施蒂利亚州前总督、纹章学著作的狂热收藏家勋伯格伯爵；神学系前系主任、正在为奥古斯丁[20]著作做评注的西根费尔特；还有八十高龄但一直还在修改自己回忆录的退休海军上将艾德勒·冯·皮泽克——他们作为他的忠诚顾客，不断地给雅各布·门德尔往格鲁克咖啡馆写信，其中有几封转到了这位失踪者所在的那座集中营。在那里，它们落到碰巧萌发恻隐之心的上尉手里。上尉十分惊奇，想不到这个半瞎的、脏兮兮的、自眼镜被摔碎之后（他没钱配新的）总跟只没了眼睛的灰鼹鼠似的默默地蹲在角落里的犹太小矮子，竟然还认识这么多的达官显贵。能交这类朋友的人，肯定不是寻常之辈。于是，他允许门德尔给这些人写回信，并请他的保护人为他求情。这一请求十分奏效。显贵们和系主任拿出收藏家才有的那种精诚团结，大量动用了他们的各种关系，最后，在他们的联合担保下，历经两年多牢狱之苦的书商门德尔于一九一七年获释，重返维也纳，条件自然是每天都得去警察局报到。尽管如此，他终究获得了重返自由世界，重返他原先那狭小的阁楼的权利，他又能重新浏览他所心爱的图书橱窗，特别是又能重新回到他的旧地格鲁克咖啡馆了。

门德尔从地狱般黑暗世界重返格鲁克咖啡馆的时候，正直的斯波席尔太太正好在场。她向我描述了当时的情形。“有一天——耶稣，马利亚，约瑟！我想，我不敢相信我自己的眼睛了——门被人推开，您知道，只开了一条缝，他总是这样斜着身子进来的。这时可怜的门德尔先生跌跌撞撞地进了咖啡馆。他穿一件破旧的军大衣，上面打满了补丁，头上戴着什么，或许是人家扔掉的破帽子。脖子光秃秃地露在外面，看上去跟个死人似的，脸色灰白，头发也是灰白，瘦得叫人可怜。可是他进来了，就好像什么事都没发生过似的，他什么也不问，什么也不说，径直朝那张桌子走去。然后脱下大衣，只是不像从前那样灵活，还不停地喘着粗气。同往常相比，他这次一本书也没带——只一屁股坐下来，什么也不说，低着头发愣，目光茫然、呆板。我们给他拿来整整一捆从德国寄给他的邮件，他才慢慢地开始读起来。但他已不再是原来的他了。”

不，他不再是从前的他，不再是世界奇迹，也不再是各种图书神奇的目录柜了。当时见到过他的人都沉痛地向我讲述了他们的亲眼所见，内容完全一致。平素他那浏览书籍的目光是平静的，像在睡梦里似的，看来那种目光已无可挽回地被彻底摧毁了。是的，某种东西已经被完全粉碎了：可怖的血色彗星在其疯狂的运行过程中一定也猛然地撞到旁边那颗平静的、高悬于书籍天空中的最亮的星星上了。几十年来，他的两眼已经习惯了书本上的那些秀美的、无声的、细得跟昆虫腿似的铅印字，然而，在那座布满铁丝网的人类牢狱里，这双眼睛必定看见过什么恐怖的事情。因为，曾经是如此敏捷并闪烁过讥讽之光的两只瞳孔上现在笼罩着沉重的眼睑，从前是如此活泼的目光透过好不容易才用细绳又重新扎起来的眼镜，显得幽暗和疲惫，眼眶也是红红的。更为可怕的是在他的记忆力所构筑的这座奇妙的艺术建筑物，肯定有根梁柱坍塌了，从而导致整个结构陷入混乱状态。因为，我们的大脑是由最精细的组织构造的，是我们知识的精密仪器，它是那样的柔弱，以至于只要一根微血管被堵塞，一根神经受震动，一个细胞疲劳过度，简言之，一个诸如此类的小小的分子的错位，就足以使精神领域中最为辉煌的和谐之音哑然。门德尔的记忆本是独一无二的知识键盘，但是他回来的时候这些键都失灵了。间或有人前来向他请教，每当此时，他总是显出一副精疲力竭的样子，眼睛呆呆地凝视着人家，根本不能完全明白人家的来意，不是听错，就是忘了人家对他说的话——门德尔再不是从前的门德尔了，就像世界不再是从前的世界一样。以前读书时来回摇晃的那种专注神情消失得无影无踪，相反，在绝大多数时候，他一个人坐在那里发呆，眼镜也只是机械地冲着书本的方向，别人无法得知，他是真的在读书，还是在打盹。据斯波席尔太太讲，有好几次，他的头都重重地磕到了书上，竟然在大白天就昏昏沉睡了，有时他对着发出奇异臭味的乙炔灯一连几小时地发呆。这种灯就放在他面前的桌子上。不，门德尔已不再是从前的门德尔了，也不再是世界的一个奇迹了，相反，他变成了一个长着胡子，穿着衣服，疲惫不堪地喘着粗气的废物，无所事事地压在那张一度曾是玄妙无比的椅子上，他再也不是格鲁克咖啡馆的荣耀了。相反，是它的耻辱，是它的一块污渍，散发着恶心的臭气，外表令人厌恶。总之，他成了一只多余的、不受欢迎的寄生虫。

所以，他在咖啡馆的新主人那里也的确受到了与此相配的待遇。新老板叫弗罗里安·古特纳，雷茨人，因在饥荒的一九一九年做面粉和黄油的投机买卖暴富，用一张巧舌如簧之嘴说服了老实的斯坦德哈特纳先生，终于用顷刻间便贬值为一堆废纸的八万克朗现钞买下了格鲁克咖啡馆。他凭借自己一双结实的农夫之手立即行动，连忙对这家受人尊敬的老店进行一番装修改造，显得气派高雅。他抢在纸币贬值之前添置了崭新的靠背椅，并用大理石修了大门，为了要修一个有音乐伴奏的舞池，正在同隔壁那家饭馆磋商。在咖啡馆匆匆忙忙进行装潢美化的时候，这位加里西亚的寄食者对他来说当然就显得碍眼了。他从早到晚独占一张桌子不说，一整天的消费总共不过两杯咖啡和五个面包而已。当初，斯坦德哈特纳先生曾请他特别关照一下他的这位老主顾，并再三叮嘱，这位雅各布·门德尔是位多么不同凡响的重要人物，也就是说，他在转让财产的时候也把他作为必须接受的附属条件一同转让了。然而，弗罗里安·古特纳在为咖啡馆添置新家当及锃亮的铝质收款台的同时，也给自己安了一副赚钱人的世道里所特有的铁石心肠，只等找到借口，就把郊区陋室里的最后一点残余从他那已经变得气派豪华的店里清除出去。一次绝好的机会转瞬之间就来了，因为雅各布·门德尔的日子过得十分艰难。他在银行里的最后一点存款为通货膨胀的大潮彻底吞噬，他的顾客们也如鸟兽散去。要想重新一步一步从小书贩做起，上楼下楼，挨家挨户去收集旧书，然后强打精神沿街叫卖，对这个身心俱已疲惫不堪的人来说已经力不从心了。他穷困潦倒，这一点别人通过无数迹象已经觉察到了。他很少让人替他到饭馆去端食物了，即便是用于咖啡和面包的几个小钱，他赊欠的时间也越来越长，有次甚至拖了三个星期之久。领班当时就想把他撵到街上去。幸亏有忠厚老实的清洁女工斯波席尔太太可怜他，为他作保，他才得以免遭此等羞辱。

然而，不幸的悲剧还是在后来的一个月里发生了。新上任的领班在结账的时候已多次发现面包的数目总是不对，实际卖出的面包数量总是与收回的钱款不符。由于有个颤巍巍的老仆役曾三番五次地跑来向他告状，说门德尔欠了他半年的账一个铜子也没还给他，因此，新领班自然而然地便马上怀疑到了门德尔的头上。打这开始，领班格外留神。两天之后，他躲在挡炉板后面，便成功地将偷偷起身离开桌子走进前屋，飞快地从面包筐里抓了两个小面包，饥不择食地一下塞进嘴里的雅各布·门德尔当场抓获。结账的时候，门德尔声称没有吃过一个面包。现在，丢失面包的真相大白了。领班立即向古特纳先生通报此事，老板为找到了这一不易的托词心中大喜，他当着所有人的面对门德尔一顿怒斥，指责他的偷窃行为，还装得很大度，说不想马上叫警察。不过，他又命令门德尔马上从这里滚出去，永远也别想再来。雅各布·门德尔浑身颤抖，一言不发地从自己的座位上站起来，踉踉跄跄地离开了。

“真是凄惨极了。”斯波席尔太太是这样描述门德尔离去的情景的，“我永远不会忘记当时的情形，他站起来，把眼镜往额头上推了推，脸色白得像块毛巾。虽然是在一月，您知道，那一年特别冷，他却连大衣都没来得及穿。由于惊恐，他把书也忘在桌上。我是过后才发现的，立即就想给他送过去。可他已经跌跌撞撞地走到了门口。我不敢继续往大街上追，因为古特纳先生已站到了门边，还冲着他的后背大叫大嚷，致使行人都停下来看热闹。是的，这是一场奇耻大辱，我心里真是羞死了！仅仅为了几个小面包就把人赶走，要是老斯坦德哈特纳先生在这里，那是绝对不可能发生的事情，他甚至会免费让他吃一辈子。可是，现在的人啊，良心都叫狗给吃了。把个在这里日复一日地坐了三十多年的人撵出去——说实在的，真是可耻呀！我可不想在上帝面前为这事负责——绝不。”

这位善良的女人变得十分激动，像她这么大年纪的人都喜欢唠叨，因此，她来回重复着丢人和斯坦德哈特纳先生绝不会干出这种事情一类的话，终于迫使我不得不问她，我们的门德尔后来究竟怎样以及她是否又见过他。这下可好，她抖擞精神，变得比刚才更加激动起来。“每天，每一次，我从他桌子边走过的时候，我的心里都会咯噔一下。我常常不由自主地想，可怜的门德尔先生，他现在会在哪儿，我要是知道他住在哪里，我会去看他，给他捎点热菜热饭去。否则，他又该到哪儿去弄钱取暖吃饭呢？据我所知，他在这个世界上没有一个亲人。然而，我终究还是没有听到关于他的任何消息。我于是想，他肯定已经不在人世了，我再也见不着他了。我甚至考虑过，是不是让神父给他做次弥撒，因为他是个好人，我认识他可也有二十五年多了。

“可是，二月的一天早晨，七点半的时候，我正在擦黄铜窗框，突然（我是说，我吓了一跳），突然门开了，门德尔先生走了进来。您要知道，他平素进门时总是心不在焉地弯腰斜着进来的，但这次好像有点反常。我发现，他显得有些犹豫不决，眼睛一闪一闪的，我的上帝呀，瞧他那副模样，只剩下大腿和胡子了！我一见到他，我立刻就明白了：我马上想到，他什么都不知道，在大白天里出来四处梦游，他什么都忘了，忘记了小面包的事，忘记了古特纳先生，也忘记了他们是怎样可耻地把他轰走的，他连自己也不知道了。谢天谢地，古特纳先生还没过来，领班恰好也正喝着咖啡。我赶紧冲了过去，以便让他明白，他不该待在这里，免得又被那个粗鲁的家伙撵出去。”（说到这里，她胆怯地四下望了望，很快纠正了自己的用词）——“我指的是被古特纳先生。‘门德尔先生。’我这样喊他。他茫然地抬起头。就在这时，我的上帝啊，太可怕了，在这瞬间，他一定把一切都回想了起来，因为，他先是一惊，随后便开始发抖，不仅手指在抖，不，他全身都在抖，外人一看他的肩膀就可知道。他再次摇摇晃晃地往门口跑去。他在那里倒下了。我们赶紧打电话叫急救站派人把他抬走，他当时发着高烧。他于傍晚死去，医生说是得了肺炎。还说，他先前已经神志不清，他自己并不知道怎么会再次跑到我们这里来的。只有梦游者才会有这样的行为。我的上帝啊，如果一个人在一个地方日复一日地坐了三十六年，那张桌子可不就是他的家吗。”

我们作为认识过这位奇才的最后两人，还继续谈论了很长一段时间。尽管他的存在如沧海之一粟那样的渺小，但正是他使我在青年时代首次领略到了一种完全封闭式的精神生活——而她则是个目不识丁、终日劳累不堪的贫穷清洁女工，她与这位同处社会贫困底层的兄弟之间的联系仅仅在于她曾为他刷了二十五年的大衣、钉了二十五年的纽扣。然而，当我们共同坐在这张被遗弃的旧桌旁携手召唤他的亡灵时，却能彼此深刻理解。因此，回忆总会让人走到一起，而怀着爱的回忆则更具双重的凝聚力。突然，她停止了唠叨，思索着，说道：“耶稣啊，我真健忘——那本书我还留着呢，就是他当时忘在桌上的那本。我该把书拿到哪儿去还给他呢？事后根本无人来取，我想，就留着它作个纪念吧。这样做也没有什么不对，不是吗？”她快步跑回她的后屋，从里面取来了那本书。我努力克制着自己的微笑，因为命运总爱捉弄人，有时又爱讥讽，偏偏喜欢以恶作剧的方式给这样悲惨的事抹上一层滑稽可笑的色彩。这本书是海恩编的图书《德国色情和离奇文学书库》的第二卷，是每个藏书家都熟知的言情文学书目。恰恰是这本言情书目——每本书都有自己的命运——作为这位已故魔术大师最后的遗物，落到了这位没有文化的女工那双粗糙、红肿的手里，大概是把它作为祈祷书保留下来了。我竭力紧闭双唇，唯恐内心冲上来的微笑情不自禁地迸发出来，我的这一小小的犹豫使这位忠厚的女人迷惑不解。难道这是什么珍贵的东西，或者我认为她应该保留此物？

我亲切地同她握手。“您尽管放心地保存吧，倘若我们的老朋友门德尔得知，成千上万与他结下书缘的朋友之中，至少还有一个在怀念着他，他的在天之灵是会感到欣慰的。”然后，我起身告辞，在这位忠厚的老人面前，我感到羞愧。正是她，以一种朴素的、但却最有人情味的方式对死者贡献了永恒的忠诚。她虽然没有受过什么教育，但她至少保存了一本书，以便更好地纪念他。相反，我多年以来却一直把门德尔忘在了脑后，而恰恰是我应该明白，人们写书的目的只是为了超越自我，同别人建立联系，并保护自身以抵御一切生命的无情的敌手：被湮灭和被遗忘。

雷泼莱拉


关惠文　译

她有一个平民的名字，叫克莱岑莎·安娜·阿罗依佳·冯肯胡伯，今年三十九岁，生在齐勒塔尔一个小山村里，是个私生子。在她的身份证的“特征”一栏里画着一条表示“无”的斜线，但是，如果一定要警官描述她的特征，那么，只要很快地朝那一栏里瞥一眼就必定会看见这样的附注：像一匹骨骼宽大、精疲力竭的山区瘦马。因为在她那过分下垂的下唇轮廓上，在那张晒得黝黑的又长又尖的鸭蛋形脸上，在那忧郁的无光的眼神上，特别是在那蓬乱、厚密、一绺绺油滋滋地黏在前额的头发上，可以说有一些不可忽视的马的特征。她走路的姿态也不禁令人联想到阿尔卑斯山民的一匹驮马所生的傻骡子那样的耐力，它们总是在那里不分冬夏迈着同样笨重、迟缓的步子，拉着同样的木制大车，愁闷地沿着山间车路爬上爬下。干完活休息时，克莱岑莎常常胳膊肘稍稍张开一点，把松松地握在一起的长着大骨节的双手沉闷地往膝盖上一放，便出神地坐在那儿打起盹儿来，就像骡马站在马厩里，一切感官似乎都麻木不仁了。她身上的一切都是坚硬的，笨拙的，沉重的。她思想迟钝，往往百思不得其解：每一种新的思想，好像都必须很费劲地经过粗筛子才能一点一滴地进入她的脑海。可是一旦她最终接受了什么新的东西，她便顽强地如饥似渴地抓住它不放。她从来不读书，既不读报也不读祈祷书，写字很困难，她在厨房账本上写的歪歪扭扭的字母使人很奇怪地想到她本人那粗笨的遍身格外凹凸不平的体型，谁都看得出，她的体型连半点女性固有的特点也没有。她的声音像她的骨头、前额、两髋和双手一样硬，这声音虽然有蒂罗尔人重浊的喉音，但听起来总有些发涩，——本来这也不足为奇，因为克莱岑莎向来不对任何人说半句无用的话。没有一个人看见她笑过；从这里也可以看出她完全像个动物，因为，也许比丧失了语言还要残忍的是：对上帝的无意识的创造物说来，笑这种内心自然流露情感的表现，它们根本就不会。

作为一个私生子，她是社会抚养起来的，十二岁就自己谋生了，曾经在一个客店里当过清洁工，最后她在一家车夫小酒馆里因为干活肯吃苦，像牛一样顽强，被人看中了，便一步登天进了一家像样的旅馆，当了厨师。在那里，她每天清晨五点钟就起床干活，扫地，擦桌子，生火，灰，收拾屋子，做饭，发面，揉面擀面，又是洗又是涮，把锅碗瓢盆弄得噼啪乱响，一直忙到深夜。她从来不休假，除了上教堂做弥撒，从不上街：灶口那一小团火对她说来就是太阳，她一年到头劈的成千上万块木柴就是她的森林。

男人都不搅扰她，也许是因为这二十五年的繁重劳动使她丧失了女人的一切特征，也许是因为她执执拗拗、三言两语就回绝了男人的每次亲近。在以乡下女人和未出嫁的姑娘土拨鼠一般的直觉一点一滴积攒起来的金钱里，她找到了她唯一的欢乐，这样，到了老年也就用不着到救济院里再啃别人赏赐的酸面包了。

仅仅是为了钱，这个愚昧的生物三十七岁时也第一次离开了她的故乡蒂罗尔。一个来避暑的职业女经纪人看见她一天到晚都在厨房和客房里操劳不息，就以答应给她双倍的工资作为钓饵，把她带到维也纳去了。在火车里，一路上，克莱岑莎什么东西也不吃，跟谁也不说一句话，始终把那个装着她全部财产的沉甸甸的稻草筐横放在压得生疼的膝盖上，同路乘客亲切友好地想帮她把筐放在行李架上，她连理都不理，因为在她那笨拙的一团糨糊的农民脑子里，对大城市的唯一的概念就是欺骗和盗窃。到了维也纳，最初几天总得有人陪她到市场去才行，因为她害怕车辆，就像牛怕汽车一样。但等她认识了到市场去的那四条街，她就不需要人陪了，她挎着篮子慢腾腾地闷头从家门口走到菜摊，然后就回家，像在以前的灶台前一样在那个新灶台边扫地，生火，忙这忙那，看不出有什么变化。九点，按照乡下的习惯时间，她上床休息，像一头牲口似的张着嘴一直睡到第二天早上被闹钟吵醒。谁也不知道她对新的差事满意不满意，大概连她自己也不知道，因为她谁也不接近，只是用发音模糊的“好，好”来应答主人的吩咐，或者当她的看法不同时，只是惊愕地耸一耸肩膀。邻居和家里别的女仆根本不把她放在眼里，她那些爱说爱笑的女伴一双双嘲弄人的目光从她那冷漠的脸皮上扫过，就像水在光滑的皮革上滑下去一样。只是有一次。一个侍女模仿她的蒂罗尔方言嘲笑她，一步也不放松地捉弄这个闷声不响的人，她突然从炉灶里扯出一块带火的木柴向那个吓得嗷嗷直叫的女仆追去。从此以后，大家都躲着这个一脸怒气的女人，谁也不敢再讥笑她了。

但每个星期天，克莱岑莎都穿着满是皱褶、飞了边的裙子，戴着农民的平顶女帽到教堂去。只是她到维也纳后第一次获准外出时，曾试探着散过步。这是因为她不想坐电车，小心翼翼地游逛着，一直看着石头墙穿过一条条使她蒙头转向的街道走，她竟一直走到了多瑙河的河湾；在那里，她呆望着这奔腾的江流，觉得有点眼熟，当她返身回来，重步踏着原路走时，老是靠着房子，胆怯地避开大街，结果又走回去了。这第一次，也是唯一的一次试探性的漫步，显然是使她大失所望了，因为从此以后她再也没有离开过那座房子，每逢星期天她便坐在窗前，不是做针线活就是空手闲待着。所以，这个大城市并没有给她那像老式脚踏水磨一样的周而复始的日子带来任何变化，只是现在每到月底落到她那布满皱纹、多处烧焦过、撞得到处都是伤痕的手里的，是四张而不是两张贬了值的钞票。每次她都是长时间不信任地察看这些钞票，她笨手笨脚地把它们分开来，最后又几乎是温柔地把它们抹平了，然后才把这些新票子跟别的票子合在一起，放到她从乡下带来的那个黄色的小木箱里去。这个粗笨的小钱箱就是她的全部秘密，就是她生活的意义。夜里她总是把钥匙放在枕头底下。白天她把钥匙藏在什么地方，全家没有一个人知道。

这种特殊的人的本性就是这样（正如人们提到她时这么说的，虽然这种人性只是刚刚相当模糊、隐隐约约地从她的举止行为中显露出来）——但是，也许恰恰需要一个视而不见、听而不闻的人，才能忍痛在年轻的男爵封·弗××这个同样极特殊的家里当佣人。因为一般说来，那里的仆人只要按照契约规定的雇佣期限做满，就一天也忍受不了那吵闹的环境了。那被激怒的、简直是被逼到了发疯地步的喊声是女主人发出来的。这个爱森城一家殷实的工厂主的青春已过的女儿，她在一个疗养地认识了这位（出身没落贵族，家境窘困的）年轻的男爵，很快就同这个漂亮的贵族风度十足的浪荡哥儿结了婚。但是几乎连蜜月还没度完，这个新婚的女子就不得不承认，她的更看重为人可靠和精明强干的父母当初反对如此匆忙成婚是对的。因为抛开那无数被隐瞒的债务不谈，不久人们便发现了：这个很快就变得懒懒散散的丈夫对单身汉的种种娱乐要比对夫妻的本分感兴趣得多。他并不是不怀好意，甚至可以说在内心深处像一切放荡的人一样温和，然而照他的人生观来说那只不过是随随便便、无拘无束而已，他这个漂亮的半骑士的人物，像对待出身卑微的人们狭隘的吝啬心理一样鄙视任何有利可图的投资。他想过一种轻松愉快的生活，而她却想过莱茵河市民那种正派的有秩序的家庭生活：这使他感到很不舒服。尽管她很有钱，他也不得不为每笔较大的开销跟她讨价还价，他那会算计的妻子甚至拒绝满足他想盖赛马厩的最大心愿，于是，他看到已经没有理由再把这个粗俗的瘦得皮包骨的北德意志女人当妻子看待了，她那粗野的高腔他听起来是那样的不快。这样一来，如同人们常说的，他便让她坐冷板凳了，虽然没有露出丝毫严酷的表情，却毅然决然地把这个伤心失望的女人丢在一边不管了。要是她责备他，他就老老实实地听着，而且装出心有同感的样子，但她的这套经一念完，他就把这热情的劝诫连同他口里喷出的香烟烟雾全都吹得不见踪影了，照样毫无约束地干他爱干的事。这种圆滑的官样文章的对爱情的尊重比任何反抗都使这个失望的女人愤慨。因为面对他这有教养、不失礼、然而却十分令人讨厌的客客气气的态度，她无可奈何，所以便把堵在心口的愤怒无情地向别处发泄：她对仆人破口大骂，她那本来正当的，但在这里却是无来由的气愤竟一股脑儿倾泻在这些没有过失的人的头上。不可避免的后果是：两年之内她不得不更换使女有十六次之多，有一次甚至是在动手打了一架之后，这次吵架花了好多赔偿费才算了结了。

只有克莱岑莎一个人像风雨中拉出租车的马一样，毫不动摇地站在这暴风雨般的骚动之中。她不参与任何一派，不关心任何变化，好像没有发现跟她住一间下房的陌生的同伴不断地更换着呼唤用的名字、头发的颜色、身体的气味和言谈举止。因为她自己不跟任何人说话，不注意噼啪山响的关门声，被中断了的午餐，昏昏然、疯癫癫的吵闹。她冷漠地从厨房走到市场，再从市场走回厨房，干她的事：在一墙之隔以外发生的事，她一概不闻不问。像一个连枷坚持不懈地没有知觉地工作着，她一天一天地打发着时光，在大城市里的两年岁月就这样平平安安地从她身边流逝过去了，她的内心世界没有任何变化，只是她那只小木箱里摞起来的贬值钞票增高了二三厘米，到年底她用温润的手指一张一张数完这些钱时，发现离那神奇的一千已经不远了。

但偶然事件像金刚钻一样能穿透一切铜墙铁壁，而危险四伏、诡计多端的命运，常常会从完全意料不到的地点为自己开辟一条通向巉岩峭壁的大自然的道路，并震撼它的基础。在克莱岑莎的生活里，偶然事件发生的外部原因就像她本人不惹人注意一样，是披着一层外衣的：间断了十年以后，国家又心血来潮，要进行一次人口普查，为了精确地填写每人的情况，向各家各户分发了一张极复杂的登记表。男爵对仆人们那字体难看、仅仅发音正确的书写能力很不放心，他宁愿亲自动手填写表格。为了这件事，也把她叫到他房间去了。当他问起她的名字、年龄和出生地时，他发现，作为那个地区主人的热情的猎手和朋友，他恰恰常在她那个阿尔卑斯山的一角打羚羊，而且正是她家乡村落里来的一个向导陪了他两个星期之久。令人奇怪的是，说来说去原来这个向导恰巧还是克莱岑莎的舅舅，男爵的兴致上来了，竟因这个偶然的巧合又谈了好一会儿；谈着谈着又想起另一件愉快的事，那就是他当时正好在她当厨娘的那个旅馆里吃过一顿味道非常好的烤鹿肉——所有这一切都是琐事，但由于存在偶然机遇而显得格外特别，而对克莱岑莎来说简直就像一个奇迹，她在这里第一次见到了一个了解她家乡的人。她站在他面前，脸红红的，心情很激动，笨拙地受宠若惊地弯下腰去，这时他话题一转，开起玩笑来了，他学着蒂罗尔人的方言，连连问她会不会唱山歌，是不是像男孩子那样顽皮淘气等等。最后，因为自己心里着实高兴，他便按照农民最亲切的方式，用手掌朝她那硬邦邦的屁股上打了一巴掌，哈哈笑着打发她走了：“现在去吧，亲爱的克莱岑莎，看来还得给你两克朗，因为你是从齐勒塔尔来的。”

无疑，这件事就其本身的含义而言并不是感情冲动和值得注意的表现。但这五分钟的谈话对这个迟钝的人那鱼一般潜在感觉的影响，却像把一块石头投进了沼泽地一样：先是渐渐地懒懒地形成一些动荡的圆圈，然后这些圆圈就强有力地波动起来，慢慢地到达意识的边缘。这个终日闷声不响的女人，多年后竟然第一次跟这样一个人谈到了她自己，命运超出常规为她做了这样的安排：偏偏是这第一个跟她谈话的人，这个生活在这无情的骚乱状态之中的人，知道她家乡的山岭，甚至还吃过一次她亲手做的烤鹿肉，而且又像年轻人那样照她屁股上来了那么一巴掌；按照乡间的说法，这一巴掌本是以最简洁的方式向女人进行试探和求婚。虽然克莱岑莎连想都不敢想，现在这位衣着讲究的高贵的先生会真的是以这种方式向她提出类似的要求，但这种肉体上亲昵的举动确实相当有力地震动了她那沉睡的欲念。

这样，由于这次偶然事件的推动，在她的内心深处便开始出现了一种牵引和运动的过程，它一层一层地移动着，到了最后，一种新的感觉先是粗线条地接着便越来越清楚地显现出来了，好比突然认识到：有一条狗活动在它周围的所有那些两条腿的人中间，不料有一天，这些人之中的一个竟宣称做它的主人了；从这个时刻起，它就总跟随在他身后跑，向这位命运为它安排的上司摇着尾巴或汪汪叫着表示致意，它对他将心甘情愿地唯命是从，亦步亦趋地追随着他的足迹。跟这种情形完全一样，现在有一种新的东西渗入了克莱岑莎的麻木不仁的生活范围，从前这个范围里只有金钱、市场、灶台、厨房和床铺这五个惯常的概念，没有任何余地；这个新东西要求占有空间，它就干脆用力把从前的一切东西挤到一边去了。她怀着农民那种一旦把什么抓住就死也不肯放手的占有欲，把这个新东西深深地拉进她的肉体，一直拉到她那充满欲念的混乱而又迟钝的感官里。当然，经过一些时候，这个变化才明显地表现出来；最早的那些迹象一点也不显眼，比如：她男爵的衣服，刷他的鞋，总是热情洋溢，分外精心，而把男爵夫人的衣服和鞋帽全都转给了那个收拾屋子的使女去照应。另外，时常可以在过道和前室里见到她，刚刚听到外面门锁啪啦一响，她就赶忙喜滋滋地迎出去接他的大衣和手杖。伙食呢，她加倍上心，甚至特地为了搞到一盘烤鹿肉，不辞辛苦地一路打听去大市场的生道。就是在她那外罩的衣服上也看得出格外细心的征象。

过了一两周，她的新感觉的这些最初的苗头才好不容易从她的内心世界冲了出来。大概又过了好几周，第二个思想才从她一个内心冲动中滋生出来，从不稳定变得内容清楚，意义明确。这第二个感觉只不过是第一个感觉的补充而已：一种对男爵的妻子，对那个可以跟他一起住一起睡一起说话但对他却不像她自己那样虔心敬重的女人的仇恨，这种仇恨起初还是模模糊糊的，但慢慢地就变成了不加掩饰地、赤裸裸地流露在外的仇恨。也许是因为她——无意中，现在是更留神地——卷进了那神圣的主人受他疯女人无耻凌辱的一场叫人难为情的戏里去，也许是因为跟他的令人欣慰的亲近相比，对那个受北德思想束缚的女人傲气十足的疏远感觉更强烈，她总是突然之间便相当倔强地来对抗这个莫名其妙的女人，并且含着刺人的敌意没完没了地旁敲侧击、恶言恶语。因此，男爵夫人总得至少按两次铃，才能把故意慢腾腾、一脸不愿意的克莱岑莎唤来，而她那高高耸起的肩膀总是一开头就表示坚决顶牛了。什么差事和嘱托她都沉着脸接受，弄得男爵夫人根本不知道她到底明白了没有；如果为了慎重起见再问一遍，只能看到她不耐烦地点点头，或听到她鄙视地说一声“我听见了”作为回答。要么就是在夫人马上就要去看戏急匆匆地各屋跑来跑去时，一把重要的钥匙忽然不见了，过了半个钟头才意想不到地在一个角落里找着。夫人的信件和电话，一般她都置之脑后不理不睬；追问她时，她一点遗憾的表示也没有，只是气哼哼地生硬地回她一句“可巧我忘了”。她并不抬头看她的眼睛，说不定她正是怕抑制不住内心的仇恨。

在这段时间里，家里的种种不和总要引出男爵夫妇之间的一些不愉快的场面。那一周一周变得更加激动的夫人的兴奋心理很可能也跟克莱岑莎的不自觉地拨弄是非的怨气有关。由于漫长的孤独生活而变得神经脆弱，再加上她丈夫的冷淡和仆人们可恨的敌意所激起的愤怒，这个备受折磨的女人精神越来越失常了。给她用溴剂和烈性安眠药“维罗那尔”，也毫不见效；后来经过会诊，她的过分紧张的神经末梢分裂得更厉害了，她无缘无故地就会大哭大闹，歇斯底里发作一阵子，然而没有一个人对她表示一丝一毫的同情，也看不到一个好心人出面帮助她的迹象。末了，请来的大夫只好建议她到疗养院去休养两个月。这个建议被那位一向冷漠无情的丈夫突然如此热心地采纳了，结果弄得这位夫人又起了疑心；开初极力反对，但最后还是决定去了，让侍女陪伴她，而让克莱岑莎一个人留在这个宽大的寓所里侍候主人。把这位高贵的主人托付给她照顾的消息，就像给克莱岑莎打了一针兴奋剂，使她迟钝的感官兴奋起来。像人们摇动一只有魔力的瓶子一样，她整个生命的活力似乎都被猛烈地摇得混乱不堪了，这时便有一种秘密地沉在心底的热情浮了上来，她的一举一动全都焕然一新了。那神志不清的表现，那迟钝的动作突然开始从她那冻僵了的肢体中融化了，消失了；自从这通了电一般的消息出现以来，好像她的关节也灵活了，步子也又快又轻了。她在各间屋子里跑来跑去，在楼梯上跑上跑下，刚刚着手准备旅行，她就主动地装好了所有的箱子，亲手抱起这些箱子送到车里去。当深夜时分男爵从火车站回来时，他把手杖和大衣交到这个干完了活现在急忙来迎他的女人手里，轻松地叹了口气说：“总算打发走了！”这时，发生了一件值得注意的事。因为突然之间在克莱岑莎一向像动物一样从不发笑的多皱的双唇四周开始用力拉开来伸展出去了。嘴变歪了，咧开了，突然从她那痴呆呆的发光的脸中间儿涌现出一丝动物般无所约束的傻笑来。一看到这个情形，男爵都惊呆了，对这种使他极不舒服的亲昵表示他感到很羞愧，于是便一声不响地走进了他的房间。

但这刹那间的不舒服很快就过去了，翌日，这两个人，主人和女仆，就被一种无语相通的共同呼吸和快意的无拘无束连在一起了。夫人不在，好像头顶上的一团云消散了似的，整个气氛都换了样：这个摆脱了束缚的丈夫幸运地免除了不断做解释的义务，头一个晚上就很晚才回到家里，而克莱岑莎的默默无言的热心服侍恰好跟他夫人的能说会道的接待形成了鲜明的对比。克莱岑莎又激情满怀地投入了日常的劳作，她起得特别早，把一切都刷得闪闪发光，像着了魔似的把门窗的把手都擦得锃亮，仿佛变戏法般端上来了美味佳肴，尤其使男爵惊诧的是，他在头一顿午餐桌上发现专门为他选出了一套往常只在特别宴会时才从银器橱里取出来用的贵重的餐具。通常他并不留心，但现在他却没法不注意这个特殊的人表现出来的这种小心谨慎的、简直是体贴入微的照顾了；他一向心地善良，没有再掩饰他的满意心情。他翻动着她做的饭菜，时不时地说一两句亲切的话。而第二天早上，那天是他的命名日，当他看到一个做得非常艺术的、有他名字开头大写字母的、上面撒了糖的圆形大蛋糕时，他纵情大笑着对她说：“你会把我宠坏了的，岑莎！要是我夫人回来了的话，上帝保佑，我可怎么办呢？”

还好，他总算在一定程度上对自己约束了那么几天，然后才抛弃了最后的一些顾虑。他从她的多种表示看出她不会泄露机密，便又像单身汉那样开始在自己的寓所里过起舒舒服服的日子来了。妻子走后，他单独生活的第四天，他把克莱岑莎喊去，不做详细的说明，只是漫不经心地吩咐她晚上准备好一顿两个人的夜餐冷食就可以去睡觉了；其余一切都由他自己去办。她没有抬头看他，也没有眨一眨眼，很难猜得透这些话的本意是不是印入了她的大脑。但是，她对他的本来意图理解得多么好，他很快就又高兴又惊奇地发觉了，因为他深夜看完剧带着一个娇小的歌剧院女学生回来时不仅发现桌子整理得非常雅致，上面还点缀着鲜花，而且在他的卧室里见到旁边那张床也铺上了，真叫人喜欢得不得了，绸睡衣和他夫人的拖鞋也早早地准备下了。这个挣脱了枷锁的丈夫不免觉得这个女人如此心领神会地加意照顾真是有点好笑。这样，在这个忠实可靠的知情人面前的一切障碍便自行瓦解了。早上他拉铃唤她来，让她帮他的娇滴滴的小宝贝穿衣服；于是，二人之间的默契便完全建立起来了。

在这些日子里，克莱岑莎还得到了一个新的名字。那个活泼可爱的年轻的女演员，她正在学爱尔维拉女士的一段唱腔，总喜欢嬉皮笑脸地管她的情人叫唐璜，有一次她嘿嘿地笑着对他说：

“把你的雷泼莱拉[1]叫进来吧！”这个名字使他很开心，那是因为他老是那么怪声怪气地模仿这个枯瘦的蒂罗尔女人。于是，从此以后，他就只喊她雷泼莱拉了。克莱岑莎头一回听到这个名字时呆立在那里觉得很奇怪，但后来却喜欢上这个名字的好听的声音来，虽然这个名字的意思她一点儿也不了解。她兴高采烈地把这次重新命名看作是一次加封贵族称号：每当那个浪荡哥儿这样喊她的时候，她那薄薄的嘴唇就咧开来，露出一大排褐色的马一般的牙齿，显出低声下气的样子，活像一条狗摇着尾巴挤到跟前去听候这位高贵的可爱的主人的吩咐。

这个名字不过是一个人们取乐的插曲。但通过灵机一动的巧妙的构词，这个未来的歌剧女主角用这个名字给这个奇特的女人披上了一件真正神奇地合体的语言的外衣。因为跟达邦特[2]写的那个共享欢乐的同谋雷泼莱罗相似，这个不懂爱情的僵化了的老处女对她主人的寻花问柳同样感到了一种异常自豪的欢乐。难道她的快乐只是因为每天早上发现那个极端可恨的夫人的床时而被这个、时而被那个年轻的身体滚得乱糟糟的，留下了通奸的痕迹，或者说是因为在她的感官里也麻酥酥地接受了一种秘密的共同享乐么——不管怎么说，这个极虔诚极冷漠的老处女是表现出了一种尽心为她主人的那些风流韵事服务的热情。她那操劳过度的、由于几十年的劳动而失去性要求的身体，早就没有什么性冲动的压抑感了，几天以后她就眯缝着眼睛目送第二个，接着便是第三个女人走进了寝室，她高兴拉这个皮条，因此心里舒舒服服的，觉得很温暖：像泡菜汁一样，对这种色情气氛的了解和它的刺激性感的香水味影响了她沉睡的感官。克莱岑莎真的变成了雷泼莱拉，像那个快活的小伙子一样好动，活泼，有朝气；稀奇的特点显露出来，仿佛被这种难耐的同感所激起的不断上涨的热情驱赶着她一般，在她身上出现了各种小动作，狡猾的行为和为琐事盘算，出现了某些偷听、好奇、窥伺和鲁莽的行为。她在门边窃听，从锁孔偷看，又搜查房间又翻床，刚刚嗅到一个新的猎获物，就像有一种古怪的感情冲动出现了似的，在楼梯上跑上跑下。慢慢地，这种苏醒状态，这种好奇的、想看新鲜事儿的同情心理，使她脱离了先前那种像裹了一层木头外壳似的昏睡状态，变成一种有生气的人。使周围的人个个感到诧异的是她突然善于跟人交往了，她跟女仆们一起聊天，粗言粗语地跟邮差开玩笑，开始插进去跟女店员喋喋不休地说长道短。一天晚上，院子里的灯都熄了。女仆们听到对过房间那扇以往早已静默了的窗里有人在低声哼着一支奇特的歌曲：克莱岑莎在笨拙地操着半高的粗糙的嗓音唱着一支阿尔卑斯山里人的歌曲，就像她们那些深山牧女夜间在草场上哼唱一样。那单调的曲子是用完全破碎了的声音颠颤出来的，因为嘴唇不灵活而走了调，但是可以肯定：那声音是十分动人的，而且充满异乡的情调。自童年时代以来，克莱岑莎还是头一回又试着开口唱歌，而在那从与世隔绝的岁月的黑暗猛力向光明升起的结结巴巴的声音里，确实隐藏着一些扣人心弦的情感。

这个爱慕他的女人心中的这种奇妙的变化，她的那个不自觉的引发者男爵看到的比谁都少，因为有谁回身去看过自己的影子呢？你知道她总是尾随在后，跟着你的脚步一声不响地走，有时为了满足你还没有意识到的愿望，快步赶到你前面去，但是，你对她的一言一行的观察，对从这种异常变化中来的那个大写的“我”的认识，又是多么少啊！男爵没有发现克莱岑莎的变化，他只觉察到了她愿意伺候他，完全是默不作声的，令人信赖的，甚至可以说是肯于牺牲一切的。正是这样的默不作声，在一切二人独处的场合也保持这样心照不宣的距离，使他感到格外愉快；有时，他像抚爱一条狗似的随便跟她说上几句贴心的话，隔三岔五地也跟她开开玩笑，大大方方地拧一下她的耳垂，送给她一张钞票或戏票，——对他说来这都是小意思，是他无意中从背心衣袋里掏出来的，但对她却成了珍贵的纪念品，她怀着崇敬的心情把这些东西放在她那只小木箱里保存起来。慢慢地，他养成了习惯，老是当着她的面自言自语地考虑事儿，甚至把一些难办的事交给她去办，——他对她的信任越大，她便越感谢他，越热心服侍他。在她身上逐渐显露出一种奇异的侦察、寻找和感觉的本能，像狩猎般探察他的一切愿望，甚至把事情办在这些愿望表现出来之前；她的整个生命、追求和愿望仿佛离开了自己的肉体，转移到了他的肉体里去；一切她都用他的眼光来观察，用他的耳朵来倾听，出于一种近乎罪恶的热情，她跟他分享着他的一切喜悦和偷情的欢乐。每当一个新的女性跨进门来，她都显得很愉快，但又带着失望的神情，好像忍受着意料之中的侮辱，如果他晚上不带情人回来，那么，她从前那样昏睡的思想就会像先前只用两只手工作一样，敏捷地活动起来，于是便从她眼里一闪一闪地射出一道新的敏锐的光来。一个人本来像一匹终日奔走、劳累过度的驮马，现在醒来了，但这个人沉闷，孤僻，又狡猾又危险，整天冥思苦想，随时准备玩弄阴谋诡计。

有一天，男爵回来得比平常早，走到过道里他惊奇地停住了脚步：难道那怪声怪气的哧哧的嬉笑和哈哈的笑声，真的是从那间一向寂然无声的厨房里发出来的吗？而克莱岑莎，两手斜拽着围裙擦来擦去，从半开的门里蹭出来，显得很大胆，同时又很尴尬。“请原谅，尊贵的先生，”她不安地瞅着地面说，“糕点铺掌柜的女儿在屋里……一个漂亮的姑娘……她早就想跟您认识认识了。”男爵吃惊地抬起头来看了她一眼，不知怎样表态才好：是对她这厚颜无耻的亲热举动表示气愤呢，还是对她的好意的诱人上钩的行为表示感兴趣？最后还是他的男人的好奇心占了上风，他说：“叫她来让我看看吧！”

这个少女，是一个非常美丽的十六岁的金发女郎。雷泼莱拉好说歹说劝她过来，并且一再心急地向前推着她，她才红着脸走出门来，但一来到这位讲究的先生面前就又笨拙地转过身去了，实际上她在对面的店铺里是常常怀着半孩子气的钦佩心情观察他。男爵发现她很美，便请她到他屋里去一起喝茶。这个姑娘不知道可以不可以接受这个邀请，便回过身去找克莱岑莎；但她已经趁人不注意赶忙跑到厨房里边去了。这样一来，这个被诱进艳遇情境中的少女无可奈何，只好红着脸，好奇地接受了这个有危险性的邀请。

大自然的变化总是缓慢的，虽然有一种反常的荒唐的热情从这个思想僵化、感觉迟钝的生物体内唤起了某种精神活动，但克莱岑莎的这种新学会的偏狭的思想活动仍然超不出眼前的范围，好像一直离不开那动物的短视的本能一样。克莱岑莎像着了魔似的沉湎在痴情中，百般殷勤地服侍着她盲目迷恋的先生，竟把不在家的夫人忘得一干二净。因此，她的觉醒便显得更惊人了；男爵愁眉不展，一脸怒气，手里拿着一封信，走进来关照她把屋子收拾停当，因为他夫人明天就要从疗养院回来了；克莱岑莎脸色煞白，吓得目瞪口呆，一动不动地站在那里：这个消息好比一把钢刀捅进了她的心窝。她只是呆呆地，呆呆地瞪着眼睛出神，仿佛她什么也没有听懂。这一声霹雳使她的脸像被撕裂了似的，显得那样的不可名状，那样的吓人，男爵觉得有必要用一句亲切的话来安慰安慰她，他说：“我看得出，你也很不高兴，岑莎。可又有什么办法呢。”

于是，她那呆滞的脸上又有了一点生气。一阵剧烈的痉挛从内心深处出现了，它好像从五脏六腑中升上来一样，慢慢地把她刚才那苍白的脸颊染上了一层暗红色。有一种东西，好像被心脏激烈的跳动抽出来了似的，非常缓慢地涌了上来：咽喉被挤压得不停地颤抖。最后，它终于经过喉头，从紧咬的牙关瓮声瓮气地冲了出来，“也许……也许……会有办法的。”

这句话像一声致命的枪击，好不容易说了出来。克莱岑莎的扭歪的面孔同时现出恶狠狠、阴森森的坚决神情，男爵吓得一哆嗦，不由得惊诧地向后倒退了一步。但克莱岑莎又转过身去，开始抽风般气哼哼地擦她的小铜臼，好像故意要把自己的手指弄断似的乱戳。

随着夫人的归来，家里又起了风波：一扇扇门被摔得噼啪直响，像有一阵穿堂风无情地从各个房间疾驰而过，把那寻欢作乐的安逸气氛从这所住宅里横扫了出去。也许是因为邻居多嘴多舌给她写了信，她已经知道了丈夫怎样滥施家长的威权干了一些有失体统的事，或者在迎接她时，他那神经质的显而易见的心绪不佳惹恼了她，——不管怎么说，这两个月的疗养似乎对她那紧张得近于分裂的神经疗效很小，因为现在是恐吓和歇斯底里的大吵大闹代替了过去的那种无来由的哭喊和抽搐。他们的关系一天天坏下去。好几个星期之久，男爵都以他历来行之有效的彬彬有礼的态度勇敢地对抗夫人的谴责；等夫人拿离婚和给她父母写信来要挟他的时候，他才温和地支吾搪塞了她几句。但正是他的这种毫无作用的冷漠无情的态度促使他那悲伤的、被秘密的敌意包围着的夫人越来越深地陷在越来越容易冲动的心境之中。

克莱岑莎完全龟缩到她往日的沉默里去了。但这沉默已经变成进攻性和危险性的了。她的女主人到家时，她执意留在厨房，最后她被叫了出去，她仍然没有问候这个返回家来的女人。她倔强地端着肩膀，像木头似的站在那里，粗暴地回答着一切问题，结果那个暴躁的女主人很快就掉过脸去不理她了，但克莱岑莎却用一种特有的目光把她淤积在心的全部仇恨向着那个一无所知的女主人背后发泄了出去。她觉得她的贪求心理由于夫人的这次归来被非法地偷走了，热情服侍男爵所享受到的欢乐被剥夺了，她又被推回了厨房和灶台边，那个亲切的名字“雷泼莱拉”也被取缔了。因为男爵需要特别留神，不能在夫人面前表示出半点对克莱岑莎的好感。但有时，当他因为经过恼人的大吵大闹觉得累了，需要某种安慰，想透一透空气的时候，他就悄悄地跑到厨房里去找她，他在一个硬木凳上坐下，就会脱口说道：“我实在忍受不下去了。”

这位被她奉若神明的先生到她身边来，以便从过度紧张的处境中寻求解脱，这是雷泼莱拉最愉快的时刻。她从来都不敢回答或安慰他一句话，她坐在那里默默地想着自己的心事，只是有时用一种表示细心倾听的目光，又怜悯又痛苦地朝这位变成了奴隶的神看上一眼，这种无言的同情使他感到很舒畅。但过一会他离开了厨房，她便勃然大怒，又马上皱起眉头，她的手愤怒地重重地拍打着没有抵抗能力的猪肉，噼里啪啦地刷洗盘碗刀叉，发泄愤怒。

夫人归来后越来越郁闷的气氛终于酿成了一场风暴：在一次阴森可怖的吵闹中，男爵最后实在忍无可忍，蓦地摆脱了小学生般的恭顺、冷淡的态度，一跃而起，把门啪嚓一摔走了出去。“现在我真是够了！”他怒气冲冲地喊着，震得每间屋子的窗玻璃都颤巍巍地铮铮作响。还在盛怒未消、满脸涨得通红的时候，他就跑出来，进了厨房，冲着那个像一张拉满的弓似的发抖的克莱岑莎说：“马上去把我的箱子和猎枪拿来。我要打一个星期猎。在这个活地狱里，就是魔鬼也一天都忍受不下去；非得彻底完结不可了。”

克莱岑莎兴奋地瞧着他：现在，他又是她的主人了。于是格格地响起了粗野的笑声：“先生您是对的，是非得彻底完结不可了。”她满腔热忱，匆匆忙忙地走进一个个房间，飞快地从柜子里和桌子上抓着一切必备的东西。这个野人的每根神经都因情绪过分激动而不停地颤抖。然后，她便亲自把箱子和猎枪扛下去放在车子里。但当他想找一句话，对她的热心照料表示感谢时，他的目光却吓得缩了回去。因为在她那皱褶重叠的嘴唇上又出现了咧着大嘴的恶意的笑容，他一见她这样笑总不免大吃一惊。他一见她这样偷偷看他，便不由得想起一匹马在准备跳跃时那拳身勾腿的姿态。但这时她已经又俯下身来，亲昵得超出了主仆的界限，用沙哑的声音悄悄地说：“先生您一路保重，我会料理好一切的。”

三天以后，一封紧急电报把男爵从打猎的地方叫回来了。在火车站上迎接他的是他的表兄。第一眼，这个心神不宁的男爵就看出一定是发生了什么不幸的事，因为表兄的目光躲躲闪闪的。有些失常。听过几句事先斟酌好的话，他知道了：原来是人们早上发现他的妻子死在床上了，整个房间都充满了煤气。他表兄告诉他，遗憾的是已经排除了工作疏忽发生事故的可能，因为现在是五月份，煤气炉早就不用了，自杀的意图看得很清楚，就是不幸的死者夜里服了烈性安眠药“维罗那尔”。此外，那天晚上只有厨娘克莱岑莎一个人在家，据她说，她听见那个不幸的死者夜里还到前厅去过，显然是故意把关得好好的煤气罐打开了。根据这个陈述，陪同前来的法医也就宣布了排除任何事故的可能性，确认属于自杀。

男爵浑身哆嗦起来。当他表兄提到克莱岑莎的证词时，他觉得手上的血液都突然变冷了：一个不快的讨厌的想法像一阵恶心一样从他心里直往上涌。但他尽力把这种不断增长的恼人的感觉压了下去，任凭他的表兄把他带到家里。尸体已经抬走了，他的亲友脸色阴沉地坐在会客室里：他们的吊唁冷若刀光。他们以一种告发的口吻说：必须强调指出，这件“丑闻”可惜已经掩盖不住了。因为早上女仆就尖叫着“夫人她自杀了！”从楼上跌跌撞撞地跑了出去。他们还说，已经安排了一个不兴师动众的葬礼——那道寒气逼人的刀光又冲着他来了——，因为遗憾的是由于种种的传言早就引起了社会上的好奇心理，实在令人不快。死气沉沉的男爵心神不定地听着，不由自主地抬头朝那扇通往卧室的紧闭着的门望了一眼，又胆怯地把目光收了回去。有一种思想在他心中不停地痛苦地翻腾着，他想要理出一个头绪来，但这些空泛的、充满敌意的言语弄得他精神无法集中。这些亲友悲痛地唠唠叨叨地说着话，又围着他站了半个小时，才陆续向他道别而去。只有他一个人留在那间空荡荡的半明半暗的屋子里，像挨了一闷棍似的，浑身打颤，头痛腿软。

这时，有人敲了敲门。他吓得跳了起来，喊道：“进来！”话音未落，就从他背后传来了一种迟疑的脚步声，一种他很熟悉的沉重、缓慢、拖沓的脚步声。一阵恐惧突然向他袭来；他感到他的颈项好像被螺栓固定在那里似的僵直了，同时感到皮肤上有一股颤动不停的冰冷的寒气从太阳穴一直流到膝盖。他想转过身去，但肌肉不听使唤。他就这样停在屋中间了，浑身发抖，一言不发，两手僵直地垂着，同时他明确地意识到，这样知罪地站在那里毕竟显得太怯懦。但他使出了全身的气力也无济于事：周身的肌肉就是不听话。这时，从他身后传来了说话的声音，那语调十分镇静，讲的是最不动听最枯燥的话题：“我只是想问一问，先生您是在家里还是到外面去吃饭。”男爵颤抖得越来越凶，现在那股寒气已经进入了他的胸腔。他匆匆地张了三次嘴，终于憋出了这么一句话：“不，我现在什么也不吃。”于是那脚步声便拖拖沓沓地离开了房间。他没有勇气转过身去。他突然僵在那里了：一种厌恶感或一阵痉挛摇动着全身。他不禁猛的一动，直对着门跳了过去，哆哆嗦嗦地扭了一下门锁，心想：这样一来，那脚步，那像鬼一样跟在他身后的可恨的脚步，再也不会来到他身边了。然后，他跌坐在单人沙发上，想把一种自己本不想去触动、但却像蜗牛般一再冷丝丝黏滋滋在他心里向上爬的思想压下去。可是这个使他反感、连碰都不想碰的、被压抑的思想，却塞满了他的大脑，它是那样的不可抗御，那样的黏住不放，那样的令人厌恶；在整个不眠的夜里和以后的多少个小时包括他身穿黑衣进葬时默默地站在棺材前面的时刻，这个思想都一直伴随着他。





送葬后的第一天，男爵就匆匆离开了这个城市：现在他觉得一切人的面孔都是令人难以忍受的，在同情之中他们的目光全是在奇怪地观察，在痛苦地审讯（也许这只是他的感觉？）。就是那些死的物件也在愤怒地控诉：只要他不由自主地去拧那些门把手，住宅里、特别是那难闻的煤气味仿佛还附着在所有物体上的卧室里的每件家具，都在向外赶他。但他醒里梦里最无法忍受的可怕的情形却是他往日所信赖的那个女人的满不在乎和冷漠无情的态度，这个女人在空荡荡的屋子里走来走去，好像什么事情都没有发生一样。自从他表兄在火车站上提到她的名字那个时刻起，每次见到她，他都发抖。刚一听到她的脚步声，他便六神无主，想要逃避：他再也不愿见到，再也不能忍受这拖沓的不在意的步履，这冷冰冰的哑口无言的镇静神情了。他只要一想到她，一想到她那刺耳的声音，那浓密的头发，那阴郁的动物般残忍而又无知觉的本性，厌恶感便涌上心头，而在他的愤怒中也包含着对自己的愤怒，因为他没有力量像扯断一根绳索般勇猛地挣脱这勒在他脖子上的无形的枷锁。他只看到了这样一条出路：逃避。他一句话也没对她说，悄悄地装好了箱子，只留下了一张字迹潦草的纸条，说他到凯伦特恩他朋友那儿去了。

男爵整个夏天都不在。有一次为了清理遗产，他被火急地叫回了维也纳，但也宁肯秘密地归来，住在旅馆里，根本没让那个一直坐在家里静候他的讨厌的女人知道半点音信。克莱岑莎一点儿也不知道他在城里，因为她跟谁都不说话。她无所事事，像一只猫头鹰一样阴沉，终日呆呆地坐在厨房里。现在，上教堂不像从前一周一次了，而是一周两次，吩咐她差事，跟她结算账目，都是经过男爵的代理人：关于男爵本人，她丝毫消息也听不到。他不给她写一个字，也不托人向她转达一句话。她就这样一声不响地坐在那里等着，她的脸变得更严峻，更憔悴了，她的动作又像木墩子一样笨重了，她就这样望眼欲穿地等待着，在一种神秘的死水一潭般的处境里度过了好多星期。

但到了秋天，有一些紧急的事非办不可，男爵不能再继续休息下去了，他不得不回到家里来。刚到门口他就停住脚步，迟疑不前了。在他亲密的朋友周围度过了两个月的时光，几乎有许多事他都忘却了，但现在当他又亲身迎着他的恶魔——可能就是他的同谋——走去时，他又深切地感到了那种令人作呕的压抑心胸的抽搐。他上楼时越走越慢，每上一个梯阶，就感到有一只看不见的手向他喉咙抓来。最后，他只好拿出最大的毅力来强制自己僵硬的手指把钥匙插在锁孔里转动。

刚刚听到钥匙在锁孔里咔拉一响，克莱岑莎便欣喜若狂地从厨房里跑了出去。当她看见他时，她脸色苍白地站了一会儿，接着就好像不由自主似的俯下身去把他放在地上的手提包拿了起来。但她忘了说一句问候的话。他也一句话没有讲。她默默地把手提包提到他的屋里，男爵也默默地跟着她走了进去。他望着窗外，默默地等她离开了这个房间，然后他就赶快拧了一下门锁。

这便是她在几个月之后对他的第一次迎接。

克莱岑莎在等待着。男爵同样在等待着，看那种一见她就出现的厌恶的恐怖感会不会离去。但情况并没有好转。还没见到她，仅仅在外面听见她的脚步声从走廊里传来，他心中便不禁一颤，很不舒服。早餐他动也没动，一句话也不对她说，就早早地匆忙离家，在外面一直待到深夜，仅仅是为了避免跟她见面。他需要吩咐她做的那两三件事，他总是背过脸去才同她说的。他觉得跟这个魔怪呼吸同一个房间里的空气，简直能把人憋死。

这当儿，克莱岑莎整天默不作声地坐在她的矮板凳上。她不再给自己做饭了。什么东西她也吃不下去，任何人她都回避。她一味坐在那里，像一只意识到自己做了错事、被痛打过的狗一样，带着胆怯的目光等待着主人的第一声呼哨。她那迟钝的头脑不十分明白发生了什么事，只知道她的主人，她的神，在躲避她，不想要她了；只有这件事沉重地压在她的心上。

男爵归来的第三天，门铃响了。一个白发苍苍、仪表端庄的男人，脸刮得光光的，手里提着一个箱子，站在门前。克莱岑莎想把他赶走，但这个闯来的人却坚持说，他是新来的仆人，先生要他十点钟来，让她给通禀一声。克莱岑莎的脸色变得像石灰一样的白，她站了一会儿，张开的手指停在了空中。尔后，这只手便像一只被射死了的鸟一样突然落了下来。“你自己进去吧！”她气恼地对那个呆立在那里的人说，转身走进厨房，哐的一声关上了门。

这个仆人留下来了。从这一天起，主人就不需要再直接跟她说话了，对她的一切吩咐都是通过这个庄重的老管家。家里发生的事，她一概不知道，一切都像波浪越过岩石一样无情地越过她向前流去。

这种恼人的处境继续了两个星期，使她像得了一场大病一样变虚弱了。她的脸变得棱角格外分明，两鬓的头发也忽然白了许多。她的动作变得笨如顽石。她像一块木墩似的几乎总是默默地坐在她的矮木凳上，脑子空空地凝视着空空的窗户；但她要是干活的话，就像突然发起怒来，气得把什么都摔得噼啪乱响。

两个星期以后，那个仆人特地到主人屋里来了一次。他安安静静地等待了一会儿，男爵看出了他是想跟他说什么特别的事情，那个仆人已经向他告过一状了，用他的轻蔑的语气说，他对这个“蒂罗尔笨蛋”的阴郁的女人很不满，建议解雇她。但不知怎么触到了男爵的痛处，男爵起初对他的建议似乎充耳不闻。那回，这个仆人鞠了一躬就走了，而这一回他却顽固地坚持自己的见解，脸上现出羞惭、甚至窘迫的表情来，最后结结巴巴地说，尊贵的先生不要认为他太可笑……但是……他只能，他只能说……他怕她。这个沉默的阴险的女人是不可容忍的，男爵老爷根本不明白他在家里留着一个多么危险的人。

受到警告的男爵不由得警觉起来。男爵问他对这件事怎么想，他想对此说些什么？这时仆人总算拐弯抹角地说出了他的看法：很肯定的东西他现在固然说不出来，但他总有那么一个感觉，就是这个人是一只愤怒的野兽，很容易伤人的。比如昨天他想要让她做件事，刚转过身去跟她打了个照面，不料竟遇到了那样一种目光，当然对一瞥目光你是说不出多少名堂来的，但他觉得她好像要跳过来用手卡住他的脖子似的。所以现在他怕她，怕得连她做的饭都不敢碰了。“男爵大人根本不知道，”他这样结束他的话，“这是一个多么危险的人。她一句话也不说，她什么表示也没有，但我敢说，她说不定会杀人的。”男爵突然吃惊地向这个控告者望了一眼。莫非他听到了。什么？是谁暗中挑起了这种猜疑呢？他觉得他的手指颤抖起来了，他急忙把香烟放下，免得它在手中抖来抖去暴露出他情绪的激动。但老管家的脸是毫无恶意的，——不，他什么也不可能知道。男爵踌躇了一下。他紧张地思索了片刻，突然想到了他的隐秘的愿望，于是坚决地说：“要稍等一等。但是，要是她再对你粗暴无礼的话，你就直接辞退她好了，就说是我的意思。”

仆人鞠了一躬，走了。男爵如释重负，向椅背一靠。每当想到这个神秘的危险的人，他就会整日闷闷不乐。他考虑，最好是他不在家，也许在过圣诞节的时候，再辞退她。想到那期待之中的解脱，他心里十分愉快。是啊，这样是再好不过的，到圣诞节的时候，我不在家，他会更坚定。

但是第二天，他吃过饭刚刚走进他的房间，就听见有人敲门。他心不在焉地从报纸上抬起目光，不满地说：“进来！”于是，拖拖沓沓地传来了那一直萦绕在他睡梦中的沉重的可恨的脚步声。好像一个死人的头颅，脸色惨白，一张死板的面孔在那瘦削的黑色的身影上面不停地晃动，男爵不禁大吃一惊。当他见到这个内心受尽折磨的女人那小心翼翼的脚步恭顺地停在地毯边上时，在他的恐惧中便混进了某种同情的成分。为了掩饰他的精神恍惚，他竭力装出诚心诚意的样子。“喏，究竟怎么了，克莱岑莎？”他问。但话一出口，听起来就不像他预想的那样和蔼可亲；跟他的意愿相反，提这个问题的语调竟显得那样冷淡，那样心烦。

克莱岑莎纹丝未动。她呆呆地望着地毯。最后，就像用脚把什么障碍物踢开了似的，她终于说话了：“管家说不用我了。他说是先生您要解雇我。”

男爵心情痛苦地站起身来。事情来得这么快，真是出乎他的意料。因此，他便结结巴巴地兜起圈子来，说事情并没有那么严重，要她尽力跟那个老仆人和睦相处，照他说来，这类偶然发生的不和是很多的。

但克莱岑莎仍然站在那里，两肩耸得高高的，目不转睛地望着地毯，她像公牛般极其固执地低着头，对他的那些客套话只当耳边风，单单等着一句话。但这句话却一直没有出现。男爵很快就讨厌自己现在不得不在一个佣人面前扮演说客这个不光彩的角色了。等他终于因疲倦而住了声，克莱岑莎依然是那样倔强，那样缄默。过了一会，她才勉强冒出了这么一句话：“我只是想知道，是不是男爵大人亲自嘱咐过安东，让他解雇我。”

她说这句话，听起来真是又严厉，又倔强，又辛辣。听她这么一问，男爵好像心上被撞击了一下似的，每根神经都受了强烈的刺激。难道这是威胁吗？她是不是在向他挑战呢？突然之间，他心中的一切怯懦、一切同情都飞到了九霄云外，那长时间充塞他胸膛的整个的仇恨和厌恶，连同那想要彻底了结这件事的愿望，像火焰一般喷发出来。他的语声也忽然全部变了调，他以那种在部里养成的大胆处理公务的精神肯定地说：是，是，一点不错，事实上他是给了管家处理一切家务的全权。他本人倒希望她好，也愿意设法撤销这个解雇决定。但是，如果她今后还要执意对管家采取不友好的态度，那么，当然了，他也就不得不舍弃她的效劳了。

他奋然集聚起全部的毅力，决心不因任何隐晦的暗示或强求的言辞而畏葸不前，当他说到最后那句话的时候，他便对着那个被误认为来进行威胁的女人瞪了一眼，坚定地望着她。

但克莱岑莎现在胆怯地从地板上抬起的目光，只不过是一只受了致命伤的动物的目光而已，这只动物刚好看到一群猎犬从它眼前的树丛中窜了出来。“我很感谢……”她用相当微弱的声音说，“我就走……我不愿意再给先生您添麻烦……”

她没有回头再看一眼，只是垂着双肩，踏着僵直、笨重的步子，一步一步慢慢地走出门去。

晚上，男爵看完歌剧回来，伸手去取放在写字台上的新到的信件时，他发现那里摆着一个陌生的四方形的东西。点着了灯，他才看出那是一只农民做的小木板箱。箱子没有锁，里边整整齐齐地放着他从前送给克莱岑莎的全部小物件：从狩猎地寄来的几张明信片，两张戏票，一枚银戒指，她那一整叠长方形的钞票，中间还夹着一张快照。这张照片是二十年前在蒂罗尔拍摄的，很明显，她当时有点怕镁光灯，那双眼睛含着一种中了冷箭和被痛打过的神情，在痴呆地望着什么，跟她离别几小时前的眼神一模一样。

男爵茫然若失地把小木箱推到一边，走出去问老管家，克莱岑莎的这些东西怎么会放在了他的写字台上。管家立刻亲自去找他的那个仇敌，想要责问她。但是，不管是在厨房里，还是在别的房间里，都找不到克莱岑莎。第二天，警察报告：有一个大约四十岁的女人从多瑙河河湾的桥上跳河自杀了。这时，主仆二人也就不必继续查问雷泼莱拉逃到哪里去了。

国际象棋的故事


韩耀成　译

今天午夜有一艘巨型客轮将从纽约驶往布宜诺斯艾利斯。轮船即将起锚，此刻船上呈现一派常见的紧张和繁忙景象。到码头上来为朋友送行的客人拥挤不堪，歪戴着帽子的电报投递员穿过一个个休息室，高声喊着旅客的名字；有的旅客拽着箱子，手里拿着鲜花；孩子们好奇地在客轮的阶梯上跑上跑下，乐队不知疲倦地在甲板上卖劲地演奏。我站在上层甲板上同一位朋友聊天，稍稍避开这喧嚷的人群。这时，我们身旁闪光灯刺目地闪了两三下——大概是某位知名人士在起航前的一刻还在接受记者的快速采访和照相。我的朋友朝那边看了看，笑着说：“岑托维奇在您船上，他可是个罕见的怪物。”听了他的话，我脸上显然露出十分不解的表情，所以他接着便解释道：“米尔柯·岑托维奇是国际象棋世界冠军。他在美国从东到西的巡回比赛中取得全胜，现在要乘船到阿根廷去夺取新的胜利。”

经他一说，我真想起了这位年轻的世界冠军，甚至还记起了他一鸣惊人、名满天下的若干细节；我的朋友看报要比我仔细得多，所以能拿好些奇闻逸事来补充我所知道的那点细节。大约在一年以前，岑托维奇一下子就跻身于阿廖欣、卡帕布兰卡、塔尔塔柯威尔、拉斯克、波戈留波夫[1]等久负盛名的棋坛高手的行列。自从七岁神童列舍夫斯基[2]在一九二二年纽约国际象棋比赛中一鸣惊人以来，棋坛上还从来没有因哪位无名之辈闯入名声显赫的高手之中而引起那么大的轰动。因为岑托维奇的智力素质一开始绝不会预示他的前程会那么光彩夺目，平步青云。他不久就露馅了：这位国际象棋大师在日常生活中无论用哪种语言都写不出一句没有错误的句子，正如一位被他惹恼的棋手尖刻地嘲讽的那样，“在任何方面，他都全方位地缺乏教养”。他父亲是多瑙河上一名赤贫的南斯拉夫船夫，一天夜里小船被一艘运粮食的轮船撞翻，父亲遇难。当地那个偏僻小村里的神甫出于同情，便收养了这位当时才十二岁的孩子。这位好心的神甫想方设法给他辅导，以弥补这不爱说话、有点迟钝、脑门很宽的孩子在村校里未能学会的功课。

但是，神甫的心血全都是白费。米尔柯两眼瞪着那几个给他讲了上百次的字总还是不认识；课堂上讲的最最简单的东西，他那迟钝的脑袋也理解不了。他都十四岁了，算数还得靠扳手指头，读书看报对这个半大不小的男孩子来说那是特别费劲的事。但是，这倒不能说米尔柯不乐意或者脾气倔。让他干什么，他都乖乖地去干，担水，劈柴，下地干活，收拾厨房，要他干的事，他样样都干得很认真，尽管慢腾腾得让人恼火。不过，最使好心的神甫生气的，还是这怪癖的孩子对什么事都漠不关心。你不专门叫他，他就什么也不干。他从不提问题，不和别的孩子一起玩，不特别关照他干什么事，他自己从来不去找活干。家务一干完，米尔柯就坐在屋里发呆，目光空虚无神，就像牧场上的绵羊对周围发生的事情熟视无睹，无动于衷。晚上，神甫叼着农家的长烟斗，照例要同巡警队长杀三盘棋。这时，这位头发金黄的少年总是默默地蹲在一旁，沉重的眼皮下，那双眸子盯着画着格子的棋盘，好似昏昏欲睡、漫不经心的样子。

一个冬日的晚上，两位棋友正专心致志地在进行每天的对弈，这时从村道上飞快驶来一辆雪橇，叮叮当当的铃声越来越近。一个农民急匆匆地奔进屋来，他戴的帽子上已经积了一层白雪。他说，他的老母亲已经生命垂危，他恳请神甫尽快赶去，及时给她施行临终涂油礼。神甫毫不迟疑，当即随他前去。巡警队长杯里的啤酒还没喝完，他又点了一袋烟，正准备穿上他那双沉重的高腰皮靴回家的时候，忽然发现米尔柯的目光一动不动地紧紧盯着棋盘上刚开始的那局棋。

“嗨，你想把这盘棋下完吗？”巡警队长开玩笑说。他确信，这睡眼惺忪的小伙子连棋子都不会走。男孩怯生生地抬眼望着他，然后点了点头，就坐到神甫的位子上。走了十四步棋，巡警队长就输了，并且不得不承认，他的失败绝非是不小心走了昏着的原因。第二盘棋的结局也没有什么改观。

“真是出现了‘巴兰的驴子’[3]！”神甫回家以后惊奇地大叫起来。巡警队长对《圣经》不太熟悉，所以不懂这句话的意思。神甫便向他解释，说两千年前就发生过类似的奇迹：一头不会说话的牲口突然说出了智慧的话。尽管时间已晚，神甫还是忍不住要同他那半文盲的学生对弈一盘。米尔柯也是不费吹灰之力就把他赢了。他的棋下得坚韧、缓慢、果断，他那俯在棋盘上的宽阔的脑袋连抬都不抬一下。他的棋下得极其稳健，无懈可击；接连几天巡警队长和神甫都没能赢过他一盘。神甫收养的这个孩子在其他方面智商极低，对于这一点他比谁都更了解，也更能做出评判。现在他当真很想弄明白，这种单方面的奇特的才能究竟能在多大程度上经受住更为严格的考验。他让米尔柯到乡村理发师那儿去把乱蓬蓬的金黄色的头发理一理，好让他显得有几分样子，然后就坐雪橇带他到邻近的小镇上去。他知道，小镇广场上的咖啡店的一角常常聚集着一群瘾头很大的棋友，根据经验，他知道自己的棋不是这帮人的对手。这位头发金黄、脸颊红红的十五岁少年，今天身穿皮毛里翻的羊皮袄，脚蹬沉重的高腰皮靴。当神甫将他推进咖啡馆时，使得在座的棋友中激起不小的惊讶。进了咖啡馆，少年人怯生生地低垂着双眼，诧异地立在一角，直到人家叫他到一张棋桌上去，他才动窝。第一盘米尔柯输了，因为他在好心的神甫家里从未见过所谓西西里开局的下法。第二盘他就已经同镇上最优秀的棋手弈成和棋。从第三四盘开始，他就一个接一个地把所有对手杀得落花流水。

在南斯拉夫外省的小城里，激动人心的事情是很少发生的；所以这位农民冠军的初次亮相，对于聚集在那里的这帮绅士来说立即就成了轰动的新闻。大家一致决定，无论如何也得让这位神童在城里待到明天，以便把国际象棋俱乐部的其他成员都召集起来，尤其是好到城堡里去通知那位狂热的棋迷——西姆奇茨老伯爵。神甫以一种完全新的自豪心情打量着他所抚养的这个孩子，但是在为自己慧眼独具而感到乐不可支的时候，却不愿耽误自己的职责应做的主日礼拜[4]，于是表示同意把米尔柯留下来，做进一步的考验。于是年轻的岑托维奇由棋友出钱住进旅馆，当晚他第一次见到抽水马桶。第二天是星期日，下午棋室里挤满了人。米尔柯一动不动地在棋盘前坐了四个钟头，一言不发，连眼睛都不抬起来看一下，就一个接一个战胜了所有棋手。最后有人建议下一盘车轮战。大家解释了好一会儿，才让这位脑袋不开窍的少年明白，所谓车轮战，就是他一个人同时跟好几个棋手对弈。米尔柯一搞清楚这种下法，就进入状态，拖着他那双沉重的咯吱作响的靴子缓步从一张桌子走到另一张桌子，结果八盘棋他赢了七盘。

此后，大家进行了广泛的讨论。虽然严格说来这位新冠军并非本城居民，可是当地的民族自豪感却熊熊地点燃了。这么一来，地图上的这座迄今为止还几乎没有被人注意的小城，说不定会第一次获得向世界输送一位名人的荣誉呢。一位名叫科勒的经纪人平时专门介绍女歌星、女歌手到驻军歌舞剧场去演出，这时也表示，他在维也纳认识一位杰出的小个子国际象棋大师，只要有人提供一年的资助，他就准备把这位年轻人安排到那里去接受棋艺方面的专门培养。西姆奇茨伯爵六十年来天天下棋，还从未遇见过这么一个奇特的对手，当即便认捐了这笔款项。从这一天开始，这位船夫的儿子就春风得意，青云直上了，令世人为之惊讶不已。

半年以后，米尔柯便掌握了国际象棋技艺的全部奥秘。不过，他还有一个奇怪的弱点，这一弱点让他后来多次在行家面前露出马脚，并为他们所嘲笑。因为岑托维奇始终不会凭记忆下棋，用行话来说，就是不会下盲棋，即使下一盘也不行。他完全缺乏那种把棋盘置于无限的想象空间的能力。他面前总得有张画着六十四个黑白相间的方格的棋盘和三十二颗摸得着的棋子；在他享有世界声誉的时候，他还随身带着一副棋盘可以折叠的袖珍象棋，在他想把一盘名棋复盘或是解决某个问题时，直接就能具体看到棋子的位置。这点瑕疵本身是微不足道的，但却暴露出他缺乏想象力，这就像音乐界一位卓越的演奏家或指挥不打开乐谱就不能演奏或指挥一样。但是这个奇怪的缺憾并没有影响米尔柯令人惊讶的飞黄腾达。他十七岁就获得了十多个国际象棋奖，十八岁摘取匈牙利冠军，二十岁终于夺得世界冠军。那些棋风最凌厉的冠军在智力、想象力和勇气方面个个都要比他高出不知多少，可是在他坚韧而冷峻的逻辑面前却一一败下阵来，就像拿破仑败在慢腾腾的库图佐夫[5]手下，汉尼拔[6]败在费边·康克推多[7]手下一样，据李维[8]的记述，康克推多也是在小时候就表现出冷漠和低能的显著特点。于是，卓越的国际象棋大师的画廊里第一次闯进了一位与精神世界完全不沾边的人。要知道，画廊中的国际象棋大师的行列里汇聚了智力超凡的各种类型的人物——哲学家、数学家，以及计算精确、想象力丰富和往往富于创造性的人物——可是岑托维奇却只是个农村青年，他性格迟钝，寡言少语，即使是最精明的记者也休想从他嘴里套出一句有新闻价值的话来。当然，岑托维奇从不向报纸提供精练的警句格言，不久报上刊登了关于他这个人的大量逸事，这一点也就得到了弥补。在棋桌上，岑托维奇是无与伦比的大师，可是从他离开棋盘站起身来的一刻起，他就成了一个荒诞不经的、近乎滑稽可笑的人物，而且无可救药。尽管他穿了一身庄重的黑西服，打了豪华的领带，领带上别了一枚有点显摆的珍珠别针，尽管对指甲做了精心修剪，但是他的整个举止风度仍然是那个头脑简单、在村里替神甫打扫房间的乡下少年。他极其粗俗吝啬，贪得无厌，一心想方设法利用自己的天赋和声望去捞取一切可以捞取的金钱，那样子既笨拙又厚颜无耻，惹得棋界同行既好笑又好气。他从一座城市到另一座城市，总是下榻在最便宜的旅馆，只要答应给他报酬，即使是最寒碜的俱乐部，他也去下棋；他同意把自己的肖像印在肥皂广告上，甚至不顾竞争对手的嘲笑——他们深知，他是个三句话都写不好的草包——把自己的名字卖给一本叫作《国际象棋的哲学》的书，实际上为那个专门以逐利为目的的出版商撰写这本书的是一名加里西亚大学的学生，是个无名之辈。像所有性格坚韧的人一样，他也根本不懂得可笑一说；自从在世界比赛中取胜以来，他就自以为是世界上最重要的人物了，他觉得，所有那些绝顶聪明、才智过人、光灿夺目的演说家和著作家也都在他们各自的战场上被他一一斩于马下，尤其是他挣的钱比他们多，这个具体事实将他原来的犹豫不决变成了冷酷的、往往是拙劣地有意显露的趾高气扬。

“不过，这种平步青云怎么能不叫这空虚的脑袋感到飘飘然呢？”我的朋友说。他还给我讲了岑托维奇颐指气使、目空一切的可笑事例。“一个从巴纳特[9]来的二十一岁的乡巴佬，突然间在木棋盘上摆弄几下棋子，在一星期之内赚的钱就比他全村全年伐木和干重活辛辛苦苦挣的钱还多，他怎么能不踌躇满志，沾沾自喜呢？还有，要是一个人压根儿就不知道这个世界上曾经有过伦勃朗、贝多芬、但丁和拿破仑，那不是很容易把自己看作伟人吗？这小伙子那孤陋寡闻的脑袋里只知道一件事，那就是几个月来他从未输过一盘棋，而且正因为他不知道除了象棋和金钱之外，这个世界上还存在着其他有价值的东西，所以他完全有理由沉湎于飘飘欲仙的感觉之中。”

我的朋友讲的这些情况大大激起了我特殊的好奇心。我平生对患有各种偏执狂的人、一个心眼儿到底的人最有兴趣，因为一个人知识面越是有限，他离无限就越近；正是那些表面上看来对世界不闻不问的人，在用他们的特殊材料像蚂蚁一样建造一个奇特的、独一无二的微缩世界。因此我对自己的意图毫不隐晦：在开往里约热内卢的十二天航程中仔细观察这位智力单轨发展的奇怪标本。可是，朋友提醒我：“您的运气恐怕不会这么好。就我所知，迄今为止还没有一个人能从岑托维奇那里弄到一星半点可用作心理分析的材料。这个狡猾的乡巴佬虽然知识极其贫乏，但却非常聪明，从不暴露自己的弱点，其实他的办法极其简单，那就是除了从几家小旅店找来的境况与他相仿的几个同乡外，他不跟任何人说话。他只要感到有个有教养的人在场，就立刻爬进他的蜗牛壳；所以谁也无法夸口，说是曾经听到过他的一句蠢话，或是摸清了他缺乏教养到何种程度。”

确实，我的朋友说得不错。旅行的头几天的情况就表明，不硬着脸皮去纠缠就根本不可能接近岑托维奇。当然，这种死皮赖脸的事我是做不出的。有时他倒也走上上层甲板，但每次总是反背着双手，目中无人，显出一副陷入沉思的样子，宛如那幅名画上的拿破仑；此外，在甲板上散步本来很逍遥，可是他总是匆匆忙忙、风风火火的样子，想跟他搭句话，你得跟在他后面小跑步才行。他又从来不在休息室、酒吧和吸烟室露面；我向服务员悄悄打听过，得知他一天的大部分时间都待在自己的舱房里，在一个大棋盘上研究棋局或把下过的棋重新摆一摆。

他的防御技术比我想接近他的意愿还要巧妙，为此三天以后我真的开始生气了。我一生中还从未有机会同一位国际象棋大师结识，现在我越是竭力想赋予这种类型的人以普通人性，就越觉得难以想象，人的大脑怎么能一辈子都完全围着一个有六十四个黑白方格的空间转呢！根据自己的切身体验，我知道这种“国王的游戏”[10]具有神秘的魅力，在人所想出来的各种游戏中，唯有这种游戏绝对容不得半点偶然的随心所欲，它的桂冠只给予智慧，或者更确切地说，只给予某种特殊形式的天赋。那么，把国际象棋称作一种游戏，岂不是犯了侮辱性的限制之罪吗？它难道不也是一门学问，一种艺术，飘浮于这两者之间，就像穆罕默德的棺椁飘浮在天地之间一样？它难道不是一对对矛盾的无与伦比的结合吗？它是古老的，却又永远是崭新的；它在布局上是机械的，不过只有通过想象才能极尽其妙；它被限制在几何形的呆板的空间里，然而在其组合上却是无限的；它是不断发展的，但又是毫无创造性的；它是得不到结果的思想，是什么也算不出的数学，是没有作品的艺术，是没有物质的建筑，尽管如此，在其存在和此在方面却证明比所有的书籍和艺术作品更久长；它属于各个民族和各个时代，而且无人知晓，是哪位神灵把这种游戏带到人间来供人们消遣解闷，磨砺禀性，激励心灵的。它何处为始，何处是终？每个孩子都能学会它的初步规则，每个臭棋篓子都可以一试身手，然而就在这固定不变的小小的方块之内却会产生一类特殊的大师，与他们相比，所有其他的人都望尘莫及。他们只是在棋艺方面有天赋，他们是特殊的天才，在他们身上想象力、耐心和技巧也分配得十分精确，并一一起着作用，就像在数学家、诗人和音乐家身上一样，只不过层次和结合不同而已。从前观相术盛行的时候，要是加尔[11]解剖了象棋大师的颅脑就好了，这样就可确定，这些国际象棋天才的大脑灰质是否有一种特殊的曲纹，他们的颅脑里是否有一种比常人更发达的象棋肌或象棋突。像岑托维奇这样的棋手，在绝对迟钝的智力中散布着特殊的天赋，就像在一百公斤不含矿质的岩石中含有一条金脉一般！他这样的实例要是激发起那些观相术家的兴趣就好了。这样一种独一无二的天才游戏是定会造就出特殊的棋王来的，对于这一点，一般来说，我一直都很清楚，然而很难想象，甚至不能想象，一个思想活跃的人竟一辈子把自己的世界仅仅局限在黑白方格之间狭窄的单行轨上，只在三十二颗棋子前后左右的挪动中寻找成功的喜悦，一个人开局先走马而不走卒竟是件了不起的大事，能在棋谱的某个不起眼的地方提到一笔就意味着不朽——总之，一个人，一个会思想的人，十年，二十年，三十年，四十年如一日，将自己思想的全部张力一次又一次可笑地用在把木头棋子“王”逼到木制棋盘上的角落里去，而自己竟没有发狂！

现在，这么一位了不起的人，这么一个奇特的天才，或者说这么一个谜一般的傻瓜第一次离我那么近，在同一艘船上，相隔仅六个船舱，但是我真倒霉，我虽然对有关精神方面的事最好奇，而且这种好奇心往往会变成一种激情，尽管这样，我还是未能接近他。于是我就想出一些荒诞透顶的计谋：我假装要为一家重要报纸去采访他，以刺激他的虚荣心；要不我抓住他贪得无厌的心理，建议他到苏格兰去参加一场报酬颇丰的比赛。末了我想起猎人的一个非常灵验的办法：要把山鸡引过来，就学山鸡交尾时的叫声。那么要把象棋大师的注意力吸引到自己身上来，难道还有比自己去下棋更有效的高招吗？

我一生中从来就不是一个正经八百的国际象棋艺术家，其原因十分简单，那就是我总不把下棋当一回事，只不过是下着玩玩的；要是我坐下来下一小时棋，那可不是为了去劳神费脑，相反，是为了使紧张的脑子得到放松。我是本着“玩”[12]这个字的真正意义下棋的，而别人，那些真正棋手却是为了“较量”。下棋和谈恋爱一样，必须有个对手，而此刻我还不知道，除了我们，船上是否还有其他爱下国际象棋的人。为了把他们引出洞来，我就在吸烟室里设下一个简陋的圈套：我同我妻子在棋桌上对弈，尽管她的棋比我还臭。这样我们就像捕鸟人，网开一面，专等鸟儿来自投罗网。果然，我们走了还不到六个回合，有个人打旁边走过时就停了下来，还有一位请求我们允许他观战；最后来了一位我们所期盼的对手，他向我叫阵，要同我对弈一盘。他名叫麦克康纳，是苏格兰深井采油工程师，我听说，他在加利福尼亚钻探石油发了大财。从外表上看，麦克康纳体格粗壮，方方的腮帮结实坚硬，牙齿坚固，脸色很好，透着红润，大概是威士忌喝多了，至少这是一部分原因。引人注目的是他那宽阔的肩膀，真有点儿运动员的威武架势，可惜下棋的时候也锋芒毕露，因为这位麦克康纳先生是属于踌躇满志、极其自负的那种类型的人，即使是一盘无足轻重的棋，下输了，他也觉得是贬低了自己的人格。这位白手起家的大块头阔佬，生活中习惯于一意孤行，为自己的成功感到飘飘然，骨子里都渗透着顽固不化的优越感，因此他把任何阻力都看作是对他极不礼貌的反抗，几乎就等于是对他的侮辱。输了第一盘，他就沉下了脸，并且啰唆开了，蛮不讲理地说，这盘棋只是一时疏忽才输的，第三盘输了，他又把原因归之于隔壁船舱里声音太吵；他每输一盘棋，绝不肯就此罢休，必定立即要求再下一盘。起初我觉得这种顽固的虚荣心很好玩；后来我想，我的本意是把世界冠军吸引到我们桌上来，所以只把他的虚荣心看作是实现我的意图的一种不可避免的伴生现象。

第三天我的计划成功了，但也只是成功一半。无论是岑托维奇从上层甲板上看我们下棋，或是他只是偶尔光临一下吸烟室——反正，他一见我们这些门外汉竟在摆弄他的这门艺术，就下意识地走近了一步，从这个适当的距离朝我们的棋盘投来审视的一瞥。这时正好该麦克康纳走棋。这一步棋就足以让岑托维奇明白，对于他这位大师级的人来说，我们这点儿业余棋手的水平是不值得继续看下去的。就像我们在书店里人家向我们推荐一本蹩脚的侦探小说，我们看都不看一眼就露出不言而喻的表情将书搁在一边一样，现在他也以同样的表情从我们棋桌边走开，出了吸烟室。“他掂量了一下，觉得没意思。”我思忖，对他那种冷冰冰的、瞧不起人的目光心里有点生气。为了发泄一下我的气恼，我就对麦克康纳说：

“您这步棋大师似乎不怎么看得上眼。”

“哪个大师？”

我向他解释说，刚才从我们身边走过、并以鄙夷的目光看我们下棋的那位先生就是国际象棋大师岑托维奇。我还补充了一句，说，就让他去好了，我们两人认了，名人的鄙视不会使我们伤心的；穷人只有这点能耐。然而出乎我的意料，我随便这么一说，竟对麦克康纳先生产生了完全意想不到的作用。他立刻就激动起来，忘掉了我们的棋局，他的虚荣心上来了，激动得几乎可以听到脉搏怦怦跳动的声音。他说，他根本不知道岑托维奇在船上，无论如何岑托维奇得跟他下盘棋。他一生中还从来没有跟一位世界冠军下过棋，除了有次跟另外四十个人一起同世界冠军下过一盘车轮战。就是那盘棋也是够紧张的，当时他还差点儿赢了呢。他问我是否认识这位国际象棋冠军，我说不认识。他又问，我想不想去跟他打招呼，把他请到我们这儿来？我没有答应，因为据我所知，岑托维奇不怎么愿意结识新交。另外，对一位世界冠军来说，跟我们这些三流棋手下棋又有什么吸引力呢？

嗨，对于一个像麦克康纳这样虚荣心很强的人，我是不该说什么三流棋手之类的话的。他生气地往后一靠，陡然说，就他而言，他不信一位绅士客气地去请岑托维奇下棋，会遭他拒绝。应他之请，我给他简要描述了这位世界冠军的为人。听了以后他便满不在乎地撂下我们这盘棋，心急火燎地冲到上层甲板上去找岑托维奇。我又一次感到，这位宽肩膀的人一旦想要干什么事，是阻挡不了的。

我颇为紧张地等待着。十分钟以后，麦克康纳先生回来了，我觉得他不那么兴高采烈。

“怎么样？”我问。

“您说得不错，”他有点生气地回答，“他是个不怎么讨人喜欢的先生。我做了自我介绍，告诉他我是谁。他连手都没有伸给我。我试图让他明白，要是他跟我们下盘车轮战，我们船上所有的人都会感到骄傲，感到荣幸。妈的，他就是不答应。他说很遗憾，他同他的经纪人签了合同，合同特别规定，在整个这次巡回比赛期间，他不得下没有报酬的棋，而他的最低酬金是每盘二百五十美元。”

我笑了。“这点我倒从未想到，在黑白方格上挪动几下棋子竟是一桩进项那么多的买卖。那么，我想，您也就客客气气地告辞了吧。”

然而，麦克康纳仍然十分严肃地说：“棋局定在明天下午三点钟，就在这个吸烟室。我希望，不要让他不费吹灰之力就把我们杀得落花流水。”

“怎么？您同意给他二百五十美元了？”我惊诧地叫了起来。

“干吗不给？C’est son métier.[13]要是我牙痛，而船上碰巧有个牙科大夫，我也不会白要他给我拔牙呀。这人要价很高，这是对的。各行各业里货真价实的行家也都是生意人。在我来说，买卖说得越清楚越好。我宁愿付现金，也不愿求什么岑托维奇先生对我大发慈悲，到头来还得感谢他。再说，我在船上的俱乐部里有个晚上输掉的就超过二百五十美元，而这还不是同世界冠军下呢。对‘三流棋手’来说，败在岑托维奇手下也不算丢脸。”

我注意到，我说的“三流棋手”这句无辜的话竟深深伤害了麦克康纳的自尊心，我心里真觉得好笑。但是，既然他打算为这个玩笑付出昂贵的价码，那么对他的这种过分的虚荣心，我也就不好加以非议了，更何况他的虚荣心最终将介绍我去结识这个怪人呢。我们赶紧将这件行将发生的大事通知了迄今为止曾宣称自己是棋手的那四五位先生，并让人为即将举行的比赛做好准备，为了尽量不受过往旅客的干扰，不仅要把我们这张桌子，而且还要将紧挨着的几张桌子统统预先定好。

第二天，我们的人在约定时间全部到齐。中间那个席位正对国际象棋大师，当然是给麦克康纳留的。他一支接一支地抽着很冲的雪茄，以缓和内心的紧张，并一再焦急地看手表。这位世界冠军让大家足足等了他十分钟之久——根据我朋友所讲的故事，我早就预感到他会来这一手的——这样，他的出场就更显出稳操胜券的神态。他从容不迫、泰然自若地走到棋桌旁。他也不做自我介绍，一来就以乏味的专业语气讲了各项具体安排，他的这种无理行为似乎是说：“我是谁，你们都知道，至于你们是些什么人，我不感兴趣。”因为船上没有那么多棋盘，所以没法下车轮战，他就建议我们大家一起来下他一个人。他说，为了不打搅我们商量，每走一步棋，他就到这房间头上的另一张桌子上去。遗憾的是没有小铃，所以我们每走了一步，马上就要用匙子敲敲杯子。他建议，如果我们没有异议，每步棋的时间最多十分钟。我们像腼腆的小学生一样，对他的每项建议当然都表示同意。挑颜色时，岑托维奇猜得黑棋。他还站着就走了第一步，接着便立即转身走到他建议的位置上等候去了。他懒洋洋地往椅子上一靠，顺手拿起画报翻翻。

谈论这盘棋的本身，并没有多大意思。不言而喻，它的结局本在情理之中：以我们的彻底失败而告终，而且弈至第二十四回合就输掉了。一位世界冠军不费吹灰之力就横扫五六个中下流棋手，这事本身并不值得大惊小怪；令我们耿耿于怀的，只是岑托维奇盛气凌人的那副样子，他让我们大家清楚地感觉到，他轻而易举就把我们赢了。每次他都似乎只是漫不经心地朝棋盘上看一眼，懒洋洋地从我们身边走过，那神情就好像我们都是木头棋子似的。这种无理的姿态不由得叫人想起，有人朝癞皮狗扔去一根骨头，却不去看它一眼。其实照我看，他要是稍微通情达理一点，是可以指出我们的错误，或者说句客气话来对我们加以鼓励的。可是下完这盘棋，这个没有人性的国际象棋机器人连一个鼓励的字都没有说，在说了“将死了”之后就一动不动地站在桌子前等着，看我们是否还想跟他再下一盘。像人们对付厚颜无耻的粗鲁之辈一样，我站起来无可奈何地把手一摊，表明随着这桩美元交易的结束，至少就我来说，我们这场愉快的相识也就到此为止了。令我气恼的是，我身边的麦克康纳这时却声音沙哑地说道：“再下一盘！”

麦克康纳挑战性的话简直使我大吃一惊；事实上他此刻给人的印象是个正要出拳的拳击家，而不是温文尔雅的绅士。也许这是他对岑托维奇对待我们的那种让人受不了的态度的回敬，也许仅仅是他一碰就跳起来的那种病态的虚荣心在作怪——反正麦克康纳的性格全变了。他满脸通红，一直红到额头的发根；由于心里生气，他的鼻翼鼓鼓的；显然，他身上在冒汗；他紧紧咬着嘴唇，深深的皱纹从嘴角一直伸到雄赳赳地往前突出的下巴。我在他的眼睛里发现了遏制不住的激情的烈焰，我心里感到不安。这种烈焰通常只有玩轮盘赌的赌徒，如果他下了双倍赌注，但接连六七次就是没碰上他所押的那个颜色时才会出现。此刻我知道，这种狂热的虚荣心将使他同岑托维奇不停地对弈下去，按原来的赌注或者加倍，一直下到他至少赢一盘为止，即使要耗掉他全部资产也在所不惜。如果岑托维奇坚持奉陪到底，那么他就在麦克康纳身上发现了一个金窖，他在到达布宜诺斯艾利斯之前就可以从这个金窖里挖出好几千美金来。

岑托维奇一动不动。“请吧，”他客气地回答，“现在该诸位先生执黑了。”

第二局也没有什么改观，只不过又来了几位好奇者，所以我们这个圈子不仅扩大了，而且也活跃多了。麦克康纳两眼直愣愣地盯着棋盘，仿佛他要以赢棋的愿望对棋子施行催眠术似的；我感觉到，为了向对手这个冷血动物扯着嗓门欢叫一声“将死了”，即使牺牲一千美元，他也会兴高采烈的。奇怪的是，他那强忍的激动不知不觉中也感染了我们。现在，每走一步都要进行比第一局更为热烈的讨论，每次直到最后一刻，在大家都同意给信号叫岑托维奇到我们桌上来的时候，总还会有人对大家的意见提出异议。渐渐地，我们弈至第十七步了。这时出现了极为有利的局势，对此我们自己都感到惊奇，因为我们成功地把C线上的卒一直推进到倒数第二格的c2；只要将卒往前推进到c1，我们的卒就可以升变为一个新后了[14]。由于这个胜机过于一目了然，我们心里反倒不很踏实；我们大家都心存疑虑，担心这个表面上看来是我们取得的优势极可能正是岑托维奇故意给我们设下的圈套，因为他对棋局看得比我们远得多。但是无论我们大家怎么煞费苦心地探索和讨论，还是找不到这个暗藏的花招。最后，允许我们考虑的时间快完了，我们决定就冒险走这一着。麦克康纳的手指都碰到了卒，想把它推到最后一个方格里。这时他感觉到胳膊猛的一下被紧紧抓住，有人轻声而激动地对他耳语：“上帝保佑！不能走这着！”

我们大家都情不自禁地转过脸去。一位大约四十五岁上下的先生，瘦削的脸上轮廓分明，脸色像石灰一样，白得出奇，先前在甲板上散步时就引起过我的注意。几分钟前我们的全部注意力都集中在解决那步难棋，他大概就是那时来到我们这儿的。他感觉到我们的目光都在注视着他，便匆匆补充道：

“您现在如果把卒子升变为后，他马上就会用象c1来吃掉它，您再回马吃掉象。但是，这期间他把他的通路卒走到d7，威胁你们的车，你们即使跳马将军，也没有用，再走九到十步棋你们就输了。这同一九二二年皮斯吉仁大赛上阿廖欣与波戈留波夫交手时下的棋局几乎完全一样。”

麦克康纳大为诧异，其惊奇的程度绝不亚于我们。他放下手里的棋子，两眼紧紧盯着这位不速之客，这位像是从天而降、来助我们一臂之力的天使。一个能够预先计算出九步之后会有杀着的人，准是一流专家，说不定也是去参加这次国际象棋大赛的，没准还是冠军争夺者呢。他恰好在关键时刻突然到来并且伸出援助之手，这简直是异乎寻常的事。麦克康纳第一个回过神来。

“您有什么主意呢？”他激动地悄悄问道。

“卒子不要马上往前走，而是先避开！尤其要先把王从g8这个危险位置撤到h7。这样，他或许就转而进攻另一翼去了。不过您可把车从c8退到c4来阻挡；于是，他就得多走两步，丢掉一个卒，这样也就失去了优势。这么一来，盘面上就成了卒对卒，如果您防守不出破绽，就可以下成和棋。更高的奢望是达不到了。”

我们再次惊诧不已，啧啧称奇。他计算得那么精确和快速，真有点邪乎，这些步子他仿佛是照棋谱念的。真是意想不到，我们与世界冠军对弈的这盘棋在他的参与下，居然有下和的机会，怎么说也神了。我们大家不约而同地往旁边挪了挪，好让他看到棋盘。麦克康纳又问了一次：

“那么就把王从g8走到h7？”

“对！最要紧的是先避开！”

麦克康纳照此走了一着，我们敲了玻璃杯。岑托维奇迈着惯常的漫不经心的步子走到我们桌边，朝我们这步对着打量一眼，接着就把王翼的卒h2进到h4，同我们这位素不相识的救星所预言的完全一样。这位陌生人这时激动地悄声说：

“进车，进车，从c8进到c4，这样他就非得保卒不可。不过他这样走也无济于事！您马c3进d5，不用管他的通路卒，这样就重新建立了均势，随后就全力压过去，不用守了！”

我们不明白他所说的。对我们来说，他说的全是中文。[15]不过一旦对他着了迷，麦克康纳也就不假思索地照他的意见行棋。我们又敲了玻璃杯，把岑托维奇叫了过来。这回他第一次没有迅速做出决定，而是紧张地注视着棋盘。随后他下的那着棋正是这位陌生人先就向我们点明的。岑托维奇落子以后正转身要走，可是就在他尚未转身之前，发生了一件谁也没有意想到的新奇事。岑托维奇抬起眼睛，把我们每个人都打量一番；很显然，他是想找出那个一下子对他进行这么顽强抵抗的人来。

从这一瞬间起，我们心情之激动到了难以估量的程度。在此之前我们下棋的时候并没有抱多大的希望，现在我们都想煞煞岑托维奇的冷漠和傲慢。这个想法使我们大家热血沸腾，兴奋不已。但是，这时我们的新朋友已经对下一步棋做了安排，我们可以把岑托维奇叫来了。我拿起匙子敲玻璃杯的时候，手指都在发抖。现在我们第一个胜利已经到来了。岑托维奇此前一直是站着下棋的，现在他犹豫了好一阵，终于坐了下来。他坐下去的时候动作缓慢而迟钝；就这样，他与我们之间纯粹从身体上来说，他迄今为止的那种居高临下的架势没有了。我们迫使他至少在空间上同我们处于同一平面上。他考虑了很长时间，低垂的眼睛一动不动地紧盯棋盘，因此几乎连他黑眼睑下面的眼珠也看不到。在紧张的思考中，他的嘴慢慢地张开，这样就赋予他的圆脸以一种单纯的表情。岑托维奇考虑了几秒钟，然后走了一着棋，就站了起来。我们的朋友随即低声说道：

“这步棋是拖延战术！想得倒好！但是不要上他的当！逼他兑子，非兑不可，这样便是和棋了，现在神仙也帮不了他的忙。”

麦克康纳完全照他的意思走棋。接下来的几步双方你来我往，我们对此更是莫名其妙，实际上我们其余的人早就沦为了摆摆样子的龙套。大约弈了七个回合之后，岑托维奇经过长时间的思考，抬起头来说：“和了。”

一刹那室内鸦雀无声。我们突然听到海浪的喧啸，休息厅的收音机里传来爵士音乐，甲板上散步者的脚步声以及从窗缝里透进来的轻微的风声都听得清清楚楚。我们人人屏住呼吸，事情来得太突然，大家还没有回过神来，这位陌生人居然能将他的意志强加于世界冠军，把这盘已经输了一半的棋下和，这真使我们目瞪口呆。麦克康纳突然往后一靠，随着快乐的“啊！”的一声，他憋着的那口气咻的一下从嘴里吐了出来。我又对岑托维奇进行了观察。在下最后这几着棋的时候，我就觉得，他的脸色仿佛更加苍白了。但是他很善于控制自己，仍然保持着看起来满不在乎的木讷神情，一面用镇定的手归拾棋盘上的棋子，一面漫不经心地问道：

“先生们还想下第三盘吗？”

这个问题他纯粹是就事论事地从纯商业的角度提的。但奇怪的是，他提问时并没有看麦克康纳，而是抬起眼睛直接紧紧地盯着我们的救星。他准是从最后几着棋上认出了他事实上的、真正的对手，就像一匹马能从骑者更加稳健的骑姿上认出一位新的、更好的骑手来一样。无意中我们也随着他的目光急切地望着这位陌生人。可是陌生人尚未来得及考虑或答复，正陶醉在虚荣之中、万分激动的麦克康纳就已经以胜利的姿态在冲着他喊了：

“那当然！但是现在您得一个人跟他下！您一个人同岑托维奇对弈！”

然而，这时发生了一件未曾预料到的事情。很奇怪，这位陌生人还一直在紧张地盯着那张棋盘，而棋盘上的棋子已经收拾起来了。他感觉到所有人的眼睛都在注视他，而且人家又那么热情地在同他说话，不觉大为骇然，脸上现出十分慌张的神情。

“绝对不行，先生们，”他结结巴巴地说，显然有点惊惶失措，“这完全不可能……没有考虑的余地……我已经有二十年，不，是二十五年没有挨过棋盘了……我现在才看到，未得你们允许就参与你们的棋局，这样的举止是多么的不得体……请你们原谅我的冒失……我一定不再继续打搅了。”听了这话我们都很愕然，大家还没有回过神来，他已经转身离开了吸烟室。

“这根本不可能！”性格豪爽的麦克康纳用拳头捶着桌子吼道，“他说有二十五年没有下过棋了，绝对不可能！他每一着棋，每一步对着都预先算到五六步之外。这种本事绝非瞬息之间就可学会的。所以他说的绝无可能——是不是？”

最后这个问题麦克康纳是下意识地向岑托维奇提的。但是这位世界冠军不为所动，依然是冷冰冰的。

“对此我无法做出判断。但是不管怎么说，这位先生的棋下得有点奇怪，也很有意思，因此我也故意给了他一个机会。”说着，他便懒洋洋地站起身来，并以他讲究实际的方式补充道：

“如果这位先生或者在座的诸位先生明天想再下一局，那我从下午三点钟以后愿意奉陪。”

我们都忍不住轻声笑了。我们每个人都知道，岑托维奇绝不是慷慨地让给我们这位不相识的援手一个机会，他的这种说法无非是掩饰自己没有下好的一个幼稚的遁词而已。因此我们心里滋长起更加强烈的愿望，要亲眼看着把他这种盛气凌人的态度打掉。我们这些心平气和、懒懒散散的乘客心里一下子生起一股疯狂的、充满虚荣心的战斗豪情，因为如果正巧在我们这艘航行在汪洋中的船上能摘下国际象棋世界冠军头上的桂冠，这个记录定会由电讯迅速传遍全世界。这个想法很具挑战性，令我们为之着迷。另外，那种神秘而蹊跷的事也颇有刺激性：恰好在关键时刻我们的救星出乎意料地来介入我们的棋局，他那几乎有点怯生生的谦虚同那位职业棋手那种趾高气扬的神气正好形成对照。这位陌生人是谁？难道通过这里的这次偶然巧遇我们竟找到了一位尚未被发现的国际象棋天才？或是出于某种尚不清楚的原因，一位著名的国际象棋大师对我们隐瞒了自己的名字？我们兴奋地讨论了所有这些可能性。我们认为，为了把这个陌生人谜一般的胆怯和出人意料的自述同他精妙绝伦的棋艺联系在一起，即使是最最大胆的假设也不为过。不过有个问题我们大家的意见是一致的，那就是绝不放弃再杀一盘。我们决定，要不遗余力地促使我们的支援者第二天同岑托维奇对弈一盘，麦克康纳答应由他来承担这次比赛经济上的风险。这期间我们从乘务员那里了解到，我们不认识的这位先生是奥地利人，而我是陌生人的同乡，所以大家就委托我把大家的请求转达给他。

不用很长时间，我就在甲板上找到了匆匆溜掉的那位先生。他正躺在躺椅上看书。我在朝他走去之前，先抓住这个机会将他端详一番。他轮廓分明的脑袋枕在枕头上显得稍稍有些疲劳；这张还比较年轻的脸显得出奇的苍白，这再次引起我的特别注意；两鬓的头发雪白，白得闪闪发亮。不知是什么原因，我有这么个印象，觉得这个人准是突然变老的。我刚走到他跟前，他就很有礼貌地站起身来，介绍自己的姓名。我听了马上就觉得很熟悉，这是奥地利一家古老的名门望族的姓氏。我想起姓此姓的人中，有位是舒伯特[16]的密友，老皇帝[17]有位御医也出身于这个家族。我向B博士转达我们的请求，希望他接受岑托维奇的挑战，他听了显然感到非常惊讶。这表明，他根本不知道刚才与之对弈的是位世界冠军，而且是目前战绩最好的世界冠军，而那盘棋他却光荣地将对手顶住了。由于某种原因，我说的这个情况似乎对他产生了特殊的印象，因为他一再反反复复地问，我是否真有把握，他的对手确实是公认的世界冠军。我马上就发现，这个情况使得我的任务完成起来容易得多了，至于万一棋输了，经济上的风险将由麦克康纳来承担这件事，由于考虑到B博士比较敏感，所以觉得还是不对他说为好。经过好一阵犹豫，B博士最终答应比赛一次，不过他特别请我提醒其他几位先生，千万不要对他的棋艺抱过分的希望。

“因为，”他脸上带着沉思的微笑补充说，“我真不知道，我能不能正确地按照各种规则来下棋。我从中学时代起，也就是说自二十多年以来我连棋子都没有再摸过，请相信我，这绝不是假谦虚。就是在那个时候，我下棋也没有特殊的才华。”

他这话说得极其自然，使我对他的真诚没有一点儿怀疑。可是他对各个大师的每盘具体的棋局又记得那么清楚，对此我又不得不表露出我的惊讶；我说，无论怎么说，他至少在理论上对国际象棋总是做过很多研究吧。B博士又露出那奇怪的梦幻般的笑容。

“做过很多研究！——天知道，倒可以这么说，我对国际象棋做过许多研究。但那是在非常特殊的、是在史无前例的情况下发生的。这是一个相当复杂的故事，充其量只能把它当作我们这个可爱的伟大时代的一个小插曲。要是您有半小时耐心的话……”

他指了指旁边的一把躺椅。我愉快地接受了他的邀请。我们周围没有其他人。B博士把看书时戴上的老花镜摘下放于一边，开始说：

“承蒙您提到，您是维也纳人，还记得我们家的姓氏。不过我猜您准没听说过那个律师事务所。它起初是我父亲和我、后来是我单独主持的，因为我们不办理报上讨论的案件，我们的规矩是不接受新的当事人的委托。实际上我们已经不再从事正式的律师事务了。我们的业务只限于法律咨询，主要是受委托管理大修道院的财产，我父亲以前是天主教党的议员，所以同各大修道院关系很密切。此外，有些皇室成员的财产也委托我们管理。因为君主政体已经成了历史[18]，所以这方面的情况我们今天可以谈了。我们家族同皇室以及天主教会的联系从上两代就开始了，我叔叔是皇帝的御医，另一位叔叔是塞滕施特滕修道院院长。我们只是保持了这些联系。这是一种静悄悄的，我想说是一种无声的活动，因为当事人对我们家族历来都很信任，所以我们依旧做着这份工作。这个工作只要求严格的保密和可靠，此外并没有更多的要求，而先父正是具有这两种品质的典范；由于他的谨慎，所以无论是在通货膨胀的年代还是政权变革时期，实际上他都为当事人成功地保存了可观的财富。后来德国希特勒上台，开始掠夺教会和修道院的财产，于是德国那边就同我们进行各种谈判和交易，以通过我们的手保住他们的动产免遭没收，关于罗马教廷和皇室进行的某些秘密政治谈判，我们两人知道的比外界知道的要多得多。正因为我们事务所并不惹人注目，门上连牌子都不挂，外加我们两人都很小心谨慎，有意避免同保皇派来往，所以我们很保险，没有人擅自对我们进行调查。事实上在那些年里奥地利当局从未料到，皇室的秘密信使交接最重要的信件一直都是在我们设在五层楼上的那个不起眼的事务所里进行的。

“纳粹分子早在扩充军备，妄图征服世界之前，就开始在其邻国组织一支同样危险的和训练有素的军队——由受歧视、受冷落和受损害的人组成的军团。他们在每个机关企业里都设立了所谓的‘支部’；他们的坐探和间谍无处不在，包括在陶尔斐斯[19]和舒施尼格[20]的私人宅邸里。就是在我们这个很不起眼的事务所里也安插了他们的人，可惜我知道得太晚了。当然，此人只不过是个可怜而无能的办事员。他是一位神甫介绍来的，我雇用他的唯一目的，就是为了使我们事务所对外像是个正规机构的样子；实际上我们只用他办些无关紧要的差事，接接电话，整理整理文件，当然是那些无足轻重、不会引起怀疑的文件。他不许拆信件，所有的重要信件都是我亲手用打字机打的，不留副本；每份重要文件我都拿回家去；所有的秘密会谈全都挪到修道院院长办公室或我叔叔的诊室去进行。由于采取了这些预防措施，所有重大的事情这名坐探一件都未曾看到；但是由于发生一件不幸的偶然事件，这心怀叵测、追名逐利之徒一定发现我们不信任他，背着他做了种种很有意思的事。也许有次我们不在，信使没有按照约定称‘贝恩男爵’，而是一不小心说了‘陛下’这个词，要不就是这无赖非法拆看了信件——总之，在我怀疑他之前，他就从慕尼黑或柏林接受了监视我们的任务。一直到后来，我被捕入狱已经很久了，我才想起，开始的时候他工作马虎大意，而在最后几个月却忽然变得积极起来，而且好多次几乎是死皮赖脸地主动要求将我的信件送往邮局。我不能说我没有某些疏忽大意之处，但是那些伟大的外交家和将军到头来不也是被希特勒那套伎俩狠狠地耍弄了吗？盖世太保早就将我牢牢地盯住了，下面这件事就是最具体的证明：就在舒施尼格宣布下野的那个晚上，也就是希特勒进入维也纳的前一天[21]，我已经被党卫队逮捕了。幸好，我一听到舒施尼格的辞职演说，就把最最重要的文件全部烧毁了，余下的文件连同为证明几所修道院和两位大公爵存在国外的财产所不可缺少的凭据，我真是在冲锋队破门而入之前的最后一分钟将其统统塞在一只盛脏衣服的筐里，让我那年迈而可靠的女管家送到我叔叔那边去的。”

B博士停下来点了一支烟。借着闪烁的火光，我发现他的右嘴角神经质地抽搐了一下，这我先前就已经注意到了，现在我观察到，每隔几分钟就要抽搐一次。这只是微微抽动一下，就像拂过一丝微风，但是它却使这张脸显出引人注意的心神不安的神情。

“您大概在猜想，现在我要给您讲关于集中营的事——所有忠于我们古老的奥地利的人都被押解来关在那里——讲我在集中营里受到的侮辱、拷打和刑讯了吧。这样的事情并没有发生。我被列入另外一类。我没有被驱赶到那些不幸的人那儿去，纳粹分子对他们施行肉体和精神折磨，把长期积聚起来的仇恨一股脑儿都发泄在他们身上。我被归入另外一类人之中，这类人数量不多，纳粹分子想从他们身上逼取金钱或者重要情报。本来，盖世太保对我这个本不值一提的小人物当然毫无兴趣，但他们一定已经获悉，我们曾经是他们最顽强的敌人的财产代理人、经管人和亲信，他们指望从我身上榨取可以构成罪证的材料，既可用来反对修道院，证明它们非法牟利，也可用来反对皇室以及所有那些在奥地利不惜流血牺牲为维护君主王朝而竭尽全力的人。他们猜想——真的，这倒并非空穴来风——我们经手转移出去的那些资金，绝大部分还藏着，他们想夺过去，可又无从下手；所以他们当天[22]就把我抓了去，想用他们那套行之有效的方法迫使我供出这些秘密。他们想要在我这类人身上榨取金钱或者重要材料，所以没有把我们送进集中营，而是给我们以特殊待遇。您也许还记得，我们的首相[23]以及罗特席尔德男爵[24]——纳粹分子指望从他的亲属那里敲诈数百万——都没有被投进铁丝网围着的战俘营，而是表面上给予优待，被送进大都会饭店——同时也是盖世太保的总部——每人住一单间。我这个不起眼的小人物居然也得到了这种奖励。

“在饭店里住单间——这话本身听起来就极其人道，不是吗？可是请您相信我，他们没有把我们这些‘知名人士’塞进二十个人挤在一起的冰冷的木棚里，而是让我们住在供暖还不错的饭店单间里，这绝不是他们给予我们的一种更人道的待遇，而是挖空心思想出来的更加狡猾的方法。他们想从我们嘴里逼出他们所需要的‘材料’，采用的不是毒打或者用刑，而是以杀人不见血的方式，采用最最狡猾歹毒的隔离手段。他们并没有对我们怎么样，只是将我们置于完全的虚空里。大家都知道，像虚空那样对人的心灵所产生的那种压力是世界上任何东西都办不到的。他们把我们每个人分别关在一个完完全全的真空里，关进一间同外界绝对隔绝的房间里，不用拷打和冰冻从外部给我们压力，而是让我们从内心产生一种压力，最终砸开我们的两片嘴唇。乍一看，安排给我的房间绝对不能说不舒服。这房间有一扇门，一张床，一把沙发椅，一个洗脸盆，一扇上了栅栏的窗户。可是这扇门白天黑夜都是锁着的，桌上不许放纸和铅笔，窗户外面是一道防火墙；在我周围，甚至在我自己身上都是空无所有。我的每样东西都被搜走了：搜走手表，让我不知道时间；搜走铅笔，我就无法写东西；搜走小刀，使我无法割断动脉血管；就连抽支烟稍微提提神也不允许。除了不许说话、不许回答问题的看守，我见不到一张人的脸，听不到一点人的声音；从早晨到夜晚，从夜晚到早晨，眼睛、耳朵以及所有其他感官都得不到一丝养料，你成天寂寂一身，茕茕孑立，守着桌子、床、窗户、洗脸盆等四五件不会说话的东西，一筹莫展；你就像玻璃罩里的潜水员，身处寂静无声的黑黝黝的海洋里，甚至感觉到通向外部世界的绳索已经扯断，你永远不会被人从这无声的深底拉回到水面上去了。整天没什么事可做，没什么东西可听，没什么东西可看，你的周围到处是一片虚空，一片绵延不断的完全没有空间和时间的虚空。你走来走去，走去走来，来来回回，循环往复。但是，即使是看似毫无实体形迹的思想也需要一个支撑点啊，否则它就要开始旋转，就要毫无意义地围着自己转圈；思想也受不了虚空。你从早到晚期待着什么，可是什么也没有发生。你等啊，等啊，等啊，你想啊，想啊，想啊，直到太阳穴发痛。什么也没有发生。你仍是孤独一人。孤独一人。孤独一人。

“这样延续了十四天，我在时间之外，世界之外生活的十四天。要是当时爆发了战争，我也不会知道；我的世界就只有桌子、门、床、洗脸盆、沙发椅、窗户和墙这几样东西，我整天凝视着同一面墙上的同一张壁纸，久而久之，壁纸上锯齿形图案的每根线条都好似用刻刀刻进我大脑深处的褶皱里去了。后来，审讯终于开始了。突然来传我了，也弄不清那是白天还是夜里。他们喊了我的名字，押着我穿过几条走廊，也不知道要带我到哪里去；后来，在一个什么地方等着，也不知道那是什么地方，突然，又站在了一张桌子前面，桌旁坐着几个穿制服的人。桌上堆着一叠纸：那是档案，不知道里面是些什么材料。接着就开始提问，这些问题真真假假，有的单刀直入，有的阴险奸诈，有的声东击西，有的设置圈套；你回答问题的时候，陌生而恶毒的手指在翻材料，你不知道里面有些什么东西，陌生而恶毒的手指在审讯记录上写些什么，你不知道写的是什么。可是，对我来说，这次审讯中最可怕的是，我始终猜不出，也估计不到，盖世太保对我们事务所的事情确实已经知道了哪些，哪些想从我口里获取。我已经对您说过，在最后一刻让女管家把那些可以构成罪证的文件送到我叔叔那里去了。可是，他收到这些文件了？他没有收到？那个坐探办事员泄露了多少？他们截住了多少信件？这期间在我们代理的那些德国修道院也许已经敲开了某个糊涂神甫的嘴，那么到底逼出了多少秘密？他们问呀，问呀，没完没了地问。我给修道院买过哪些有价证券，同哪些银行有通信往来？我认不认识一位某某先生？我收到过瑞士或者某某地方的信件没有？我一点也估计不出，他们到底查到了多少问题，所以我每个回答关系都非常重大。要是我承认了他们尚未掌握的某件事，我也许就会无谓地使某人罹难；我要是什么都不承认，那就自己害了自己。

“不过，审讯还不是最可怕的。最可怕的是审讯以后回到我那虚空之中，回到那个有着同一张桌子、同一张床、同一个洗脸盆和同样的壁纸的同样的房间里。因为只要我单独一人的时候，我就要重新琢磨审讯的情况，思考怎么回答才最聪明，下次提审也许会因我说话不小心而引起他们的怀疑，如果这样，我该怎么说才能弥补。我仔细思量，反复琢磨，认真检查我向预审官说的每一句证词，把他们提出的每个问题和我回答的每一句话都简要重复一遍，想估量一下我说的话有哪些可能被记录在案。不过我知道，我永远也估计不出来，也不会知道。但是这些思想一旦在这虚无的空间里发动起来，就不停地在脑袋里转动，翻来覆去，循环往复，还不断地想出一些新的事情来，而且睡着了脑袋里还在转；每次审讯之后，我脑子里还在经历着那些提问，深究和折磨的煎熬，或许甚至比审讯时的折磨更为残忍，因为每次审讯一个小时就结束了，而审讯之后由于寂寞的无情折磨，脑袋所受的煎熬却是没有完结的时候。我的四周总是只有桌子、柜子、床、壁纸、窗户，没有任何分散我注意力的东西，没有书，没有报纸，没有陌生的面孔，没有可以记点东西的铅笔，没有可以用来玩的火柴，没有，没有，什么都没有。现在我才发觉，把人单独囚禁在饭店的房间里这一套做法用心何其险恶，对人精神上的摧残又何其厉害。要是在集中营里，也许得用小车推石头，推得两只手磨出血来，两只脚冻僵在鞋里，可能得二三十人挤在一个又臭又冷的小屋里。可是你能看到人的脸，可以将目光投向一片田地，一辆手推车，一棵树，一颗星星，以及别的什么东西，而这里呢，你周围都是同样的东西，始终都是这些东西，从来不会改变，真是可怕。这里没有什么东西可以使我分心，使我从自己的思想、从自己的胡思乱想、从自己病态地将审讯时的提问和自己的回答不断复述中解脱出来。而这一点恰恰正是他们打的如意算盘——他们要憋死你，要让你自己的思想来憋你，直到憋得你喘不过气来，你别无他法，最后只好向他们吐露真相，将他们想要的一切招供出来，归终把材料和人统统抛了出来。我渐渐感觉到，在这虚空的令人毛骨悚然的压力下，我的神经开始松弛了，我意识到这种危险，便把神经绷得紧紧的，我想，即使把每根神经都绷断，也要找到或者想出点事情来分散自己的注意力。为了使自己有点事做，我就试着把以前会背的东西，如民歌、儿歌、中学课本里的幽默故事、民法条款等，一一朗诵出来，并再复述一遍。后来我又试着演算，随便拿些数字来相加、相除，可是在虚空中我的记忆缺少附着力，没有能使我的思想集中在上面的东西。脑袋里老是出现和闪烁着这个想法：他们知道什么？我昨天说了些什么，下次又该说些什么？

“这种真是难以描述的状况延续了四个月。四个月，写起来容易，才不过两个字！说起来也容易：四个月，一共才四个音节。[25]嘴唇动一下就把这几个音发出来了：四个月！但是谁也无法描述、测定，谁也无法用直观例子向别人、也无法向自己说明，在没有空间、没有时间的情况下时间有多长，无法向别人讲清楚，这虚空，虚空，你周围的虚空是如何蛀食和摧毁你的心灵的，整日所见就只有桌子、床、洗脸盆和壁纸，屋里成天都是沉默，成天是同一个看守，他看都不看你一眼就把饭塞了进来，时时刻刻是同样的思想在虚空中围着你转啊转，直弄得你神经错乱，疯疯癫癫为止。我心里惴惴不安，从一些细小的征兆中我发觉自己的脑子混乱了。起先，在审讯的时候心里是清楚的，陈述冷静沉着，深思熟虑；哪些该说，哪些不该说，这种双重思维还在起作用。现在我连说最简单的句子都是结结巴巴的，因为我在作法庭陈述时，眼睛总像是着了魔似的愣愣地盯着那支往纸上做着记录的笔，仿佛我想追上自己说的话似的。我感觉到，我的力气越来越不济了，我感觉到，为了救我自己，我将会把自己所知道的一切，也许还有更多的东西全部交代出来，为了摆脱虚空的窒息，我将会出卖十二个人，供出他们的秘密，而我自己呢，除了片刻休息之外，什么好处也得不着，我感觉到这样的一刻越来越近了。一天晚上确已走到了这一步：在我快要憋死的当间，看守恰好给我送饭来，于是我就突然朝他背后喊：‘您带我去审讯！我什么都交代！什么都交代！我要交代文件在哪儿，钱在哪儿！我统统都交代，彻底交代！’幸好他没有听到更多的东西，或许他也不想听我说。

“在这极其艰难的时刻，发生了一件意想不到的事。这件事把我救了，至少在一段时间里把我救了。那是七月底一个乌云密布的阴沉沉的雨天：我所以还清楚地记得这个细节，那是因为我被押去审讯、穿过走廊时，雨水正噼噼啪啪地打在玻璃窗上。我得在预审的候审室里等着。每次带去受审都得等，让你等，这也是一种手法。首先，通过叫喊，通过深夜里突然把你从囚室里提溜去受审，让你的神经高度紧张起来，然后，等你做好审讯准备，思想和意志都振作起来准备反击时，他们又让你等着，毫无意义地、无缘无故地等着，一小时，两小时，三小时地等着，等得你身心交瘁。在星期四，七月二十七日，这一天他们让我等得特别长，让我在候审室站着等了两个小时；这个日期我所以还记得，那是有个特别原因的。在候审室里当然不许我坐，我在那里站了两个小时，腿都要站断了。候审室里挂了一本月历，我无法向您解释，在当时如饥似渴地向往着印刷的和手写的东西的情况下，我是如何目不转睛地，如何牢牢地紧盯着墙上‘七月二十七日’这几个字的；我仿佛把这几个字吞进了肚里，刻在了脑子里。随后我又等着，等着，眼睛注视着房门，看它什么时候终于会打开，同时心里在思考，审判官这次会问我什么问题，不过我也知道，他们问的问题可能和我准备的截然不同。但是不管怎么说，这种等待和站立的折磨同时也是一件好事，一种快乐，因为这间屋子怎么说也和我那间不一样，不一样，要稍微大一点，有两扇窗户，而我那间只有一扇，还有，这里没有床，没有洗脸盆，窗台上也没有那道明显的、我观察了几百万次的裂缝。房门油漆的颜色也不一样，靠墙放着另一把沙发椅，左边是一个档案柜，以及一个有挂钩的衣帽架，挂钩上挂着三四件湿军大衣，那是折磨我的刑警们的大衣。也就是说，我在这里可以看到一些新东西，同我那屋里不一样的东西，我那饥饿的眼睛终于又可以看到一些别的东西了，它们贪婪地盯着每一件东西。我细细察看这几件大衣上的每一个皱褶，譬如说，我看到一件大衣的湿领子上挂着一颗水滴，您听起来一定很好笑。我怀着莫名其妙的激动心情等待着，看这颗水滴最后会不会克服重力作用，继续长久地附着在衣领上——是的，凝视着这颗水滴，屏住呼吸对它凝视了数分钟之久，仿佛这颗水滴上悬挂着我的生命似的。后来水滴终于滚落下来了，我就开始数大衣上的纽扣，一件是八颗，另一件也是八颗，第三件是十颗，接着我又比较大衣的翻领；我饥渴难当的眼睛以一种我无法描述的贪婪触摸、把玩和抓住所有这些可笑的微不足道的小事。突然，我的目光呆呆地盯着一样东西。我发现，一件大衣的口袋鼓鼓的。我走近一些，凸起的东西呈长方形。从这一点我就看出这个略为有点鼓突的口袋里藏着的东西：一本书！我的双膝开始发抖：一本书！我已经有四个月手里没有拿过书了，光是想象一本书，想象书里可以看到一个挨一个的字排列成一本书的一行行，一页页，一张张，可以阅读和追踪别的一些新的、不熟悉的、可以分散注意力的思想，并将这些思想记在脑子里——光是这么一想。就令你心驰神往，销魂荡魄。我的眼睛像着了魔似的紧紧盯着那个小小的鼓突的地方，我的灼热的目光紧紧盯着那个不显眼的地方，仿佛想要在大衣上烧个窟窿似的。我终于无法抑制自己的贪欲；我下意识地一点点移近去。我思忖，这回至少可以隔着呢料拿手触摸一本书了。这个想法使我手指上的神经一直热到指甲上。几乎在不知不觉中，我往那儿越挨越近。幸好看守没有注意我这个肯定很奇怪的举动；也许他也觉得，一个人直直地站了两个小时以后，想稍微往墙上靠靠，这是很自然的。我终于站在挨大衣很近的地方了，我故意把双手反背着，以便人不知鬼不觉地碰到大衣。我触摸了呢料，透过面料我确实感觉到有个长方形的东西，这东西可以弯曲，而且还会窸窣作响——一本书！一本书！偷走这本书！这个念头像枪弹似的穿过我的脑子。也许会成功，你可以把书藏在囚室里，然后就读啊读，终于又可以读到书了！这个想法刚闪进我的脑袋，就像烈性毒药似的发生作用了：我耳朵里一下子嗡嗡直响，我的心怦怦直跳，双手冰凉，都不听使唤了。但是经过第一阵沉迷之后，我又轻轻地、巧妙地更往大衣挨近，两眼紧紧盯着看守，同时用藏在背后的双手把口袋里的那本书从下往上托起。接着将书一把抓住，再轻轻地、小心翼翼地一抽，突然，这本不很厚的小书就到了我的手里。现在我才为自己的行为感到后怕。但是我又不能再把书放回去了。可是把书往哪儿放呢？我把书从背后塞到裤子里，掖在系腰带的地方，再从那里将它慢慢挪到腰部，这样走路的时候我就可以像军人那样用手贴着裤缝，把书压住。现在该做第一次试验了。我离开衣架，一步，两步，三步。行。只要把手紧紧压着腰带，走路的时候就可以把书夹住。

“接着就开始审讯了。这次受审我付出的精力比哪次都多，因为这回我在回答问题的时候其实并没有把全部精力集中在我的口供上，而是首先一心想着要不露声色地把书夹住。幸好这次审讯很快就结束了，我安然将书带到我的房间——我不想详述种种细节来耽误您的时间，因为在走廊里书一下从裤子里滑了下来，真危险，我不得不假装一阵剧烈的咳嗽，咳得弯下腰去，把书重新安然塞回到腰带下。不过，当我带着这本书回到我的地狱里，终于独自一人、可又不再是独自一人的时候，我是什么样的心情啊！

“您大概会想，我一定立即抓起书来看了看，就读了起来。完全不是！首先我要品味一下阅读前的乐趣。我身边有了一本书，自己可以先去幻想一番，这本窃得的书最好是哪一类，这是一种故意延缓的、并且使我的神经奇妙地兴奋起来的快乐：首先这是一本印得很密的书，有很多很多字，有很多很多薄薄的书页，这样我就可以多读一些时间，再就是，我希望这是一本能够在精神上给我激励的作品，不是肤浅的、轻松的作品，而是本可以学习、可以背诵的作品，最好是诗歌，是歌德或荷马——这是个多么大胆的梦啊！可是我终于无法继续控制住自己的欲望和好奇心了。我往床上一躺——这样，万一看守突然把门打开，他也抓不住我的把柄——哆哆嗦嗦地从腰带下抽出书来。

“看了第一眼就使我大为扫兴，甚至感到极其恼怒：冒着那么大的危险窃得的这本书，积聚着那么热烈的期望的这本书只是一本棋谱，是一百五十盘名局汇编。要不是我的窗户闩着，关得严严实实的，我一怒之下不把书从窗户里扔出去才怪，我要这么一本毫无意义的书有什么用？我上中学时像大多数学生一样，无聊的时候偶尔也下棋玩玩。可是这本理论的东西我要它干吗？没有对手可不能下棋，更不用说没有棋子和棋盘了。我懊恼地把这本棋谱浏览了一下，心想说不定会发现什么可读的东西呢，譬如说一篇序言啦，一篇导读啦。但是除了一盘盘名局的光巴巴的正方形棋图以及棋图之下起先令我莫名其妙的符号，诸如a2—a3，Sf1—g3之外，其他什么也没有。这一切我觉得像是一种无法解开的代数方程式。后来我才渐渐地猜出，a、b、c这些字母代表经线，数字1至8代表纬线，两者相合就可以确定每个棋子的位置。这么一来，这些纯粹图解式的示意图毕竟获得了一种语言。我思忖，也许我可以在囚室里做一个棋盘，然后就照着棋谱把这些棋局摆一摆；像是上天的旨意，我床单的图案恰好是粗线条的方格子。把床单好好一叠，终于把它摺出六十四个方格来了。于是我就先把书藏在褥子底下，并将书的第一页撕掉。接着我就开始用我省下来的小块面包屑做成王、后等棋子的样子，不言而喻，棋子做得很可笑，很不完美。经过不断努力，我终于可以在方格床单上摆出棋谱上标明的各个位置了。我把这些可笑的面包屑棋子的一半涂上灰，使颜色深一些，以示区别。但是当我试图用这些棋子将一局棋从头到尾复盘时，起初我失败了。头几天我摆棋的时候，摆着摆着就乱套了，一局棋我就得摆五次，十次，二十次，每次都是从头摆起。不过世界上有谁像我这个虚空的奴隶拥有那么多无法利用的和毫无用处的时间呢？又有谁有那么多无法估量的欲望和耐心呢？六天以后我已经能完美地把这盘棋下完了，再过八天我连面包屑都不用放在床单上，就可以把棋谱上这一盘每步棋的位置记得清清楚楚，再过八天，连方格床单也用不着了。起先棋谱上a1、a2、c7、c8这些抽象的符号现在在我脑子里都自动变成了一个个看得见的形象化的位置。这个转化完全成功了：我将棋盘连同棋子都投影在我的脑袋里，光用棋界用语就能看到每步棋的位置，就像一位训练有素的音乐家，只要朝乐谱看上一眼，就足以听出各个声部以及和声来。又过了十四天，我已经能毫不费力地背下棋谱上的每一盘棋——用行话来说，就是下盲棋。现在我才开始懂得，我这次大胆的偷窃给我带来了无可估量的欣慰。因为我一下子有事做了——如果您愿意也可以说这是毫无意义、毫无用处的事，不过它确实摧毁了包围着我的虚空，有了一百五十盘棋的棋谱，我就有了一件神奇的武器来抵御令人窒息的时空的单调。为了使这项新找来的事儿始终保持它的魅力，从现在起我把每天的时间做了精确的划分：上午摆两盘，下午摆两盘，晚上再快速复一次盘。在此之前，我的日子像明胶一样无形无状地延伸着，现在可是填得满满的了，我有事做了，而又不感到疲倦，因为下棋具有一种奇妙的好处，可使智力专注于一个狭窄的范围里，不论如何费劲思考，脑子也不会松弛，相反，会更加增强大脑的灵活和张力。起初我只是机械地照着名局摆棋，在这过程中，在我心里慢慢开始出现一种对国际象棋的艺术妙趣横生的理解。我学会了进攻和防御的精微着法，行棋布阵的谋略和深邃的洞察力，我掌握了预先计算，互相呼应和巧妙应着等技巧，不久就能准确无误地识得每位国际象棋大师棋风的个人特点，就像一个人只消读几行诗就能确定该诗出自哪位诗人之手一样。这件事开始时纯粹是为了填满时间而干的，现在变成了享受，阿廖欣、拉斯克、波戈留波夫、塔尔塔柯威尔等伟大的国际象棋战略家的形象，宛若亲爱的朋友，都来到我这寂寞的斗室。棋局中无穷无尽的变化使这间不会说话的囚室每天都充满了生气，正是因为我的练习很有规律性，使我原本已经受了损害的思维能力又恢复了自信；我感觉到我的脑子又重新活跃和振奋起来了。而且由于不断进行思维训练，甚至还好像磨得更锋利了。我考虑问题的时候思路更清晰，思想更集中，这一点尤其是在审讯的时候得到了证明：不知不觉中，在棋盘上对付虚假的讹诈和暗藏的诡计方面达到了完美无缺的程度；从这时起提审的时候我再也不露出任何破绽，我甚至还觉得，盖世太保们渐渐开始带着某种敬意来观察我了。也许他们在暗暗自问，他们看着其他人都垮了，唯独我还在进行不屈不挠的反抗，这种力量是从哪些秘密源泉汲取的？

“这是我的幸福时光，我日复一日地将棋谱上的一百五十盘棋局系统地一一进行复盘，这段时间大约延续了两个半月至三个月。随后出乎意料，我又遇到了一个死点。突然之间我又重新面对一片虚空，因为我把每盘棋都从头到尾下了二三十次，这样，这些棋局就失去了新鲜的魅力，不再给人以惊喜，先前那种令人兴奋、令人激动的力量枯竭了。这些棋局的每一步我早已背得滚瓜烂熟，再一次又一次地将它们重复又有什么意思？刚一开局，这盘棋的进程就像自动在我心里展开了，已经不再有惊喜，不再有紧张，不再有任何问题了。为了使自己有事可做，为了给自己制造已经成了不可或缺的劳累，并分散自己的注意力，我真需要另一本汇集了别的棋局的书。可是这是完全不可能的，所以在这条奇怪的歧途上只有一条路：必须自己发明新的棋局来代替旧的棋局。我必须设法跟自己下，更确切地说，是向自己作战。

“我不知道，对于这种‘游戏中的游戏’——同自己对弈的精神状态您了解到何种程度。但是只要粗略一想，就足以明白，下国际象棋是一种纯粹的、没有偶然性的思维游戏，因此要跟自己对弈的想法从逻辑上来说是荒谬的。国际象棋的引人入胜之处，从根本上来说仅仅在于其战略是在两个不同的脑袋里不同地发展的，在这种精神战争中黑方并不知道白方的花招，所以不断想方设法去猜测和挫败其诡计，同时就白方而言，对于黑方的秘密意图它力图预先加以识破，给予反击。如果现在执黑和执白是同一个人，那情况就十分荒谬了：同一个大脑同时对一些事情既应该知道，又不应该知道，作为白方在行棋的时候，它能奉命忘掉一分钟前黑方的愿望和意图。这种双重思维其实是以意识的完全分裂为前提的，大脑的功能就像机械仪表一样，开关自如。想要自己战自己，这在国际象棋中是个悖谬，就像一个人想要跳过自己的影子一样。

“好了，说简短些吧，这种背理和荒谬之事我在绝望中竟试了几个月之久。可是，为了使自己不至于陷入完全精神错乱或者智力的彻底衰颓，除了去做这件荒唐事之外，我别无选择。我那可怕的处境逼得我不得不至少去试一试，把自己分裂成一个黑方我和一个白方我，要不然我就得被我周围恐怖的虚空压垮。”

B博士往躺椅上一靠，闭了一会儿眼睛。他仿佛要把令人心烦意乱的回忆强压下去似的。他左边嘴角上又出现了奇怪的抽搐，他无法控制的抽搐。接着，他在躺椅上把身子略为坐直一些。

“这样，到此为止，我希望已经把一切都向您讲得相当清楚了。但遗憾的是我自己也拿不准，其余的事是否也能那么清楚地说给您听。因为这件新工作要求脑子保持绝对的紧张，这就使它不能同时进行任何自我控制。我已经向您提到过，照我看，同自己对弈这本身就很荒谬绝伦；但是即使是荒唐事，面前总有一个实实在在的棋盘，那毕竟还有一个最小的机会，而棋盘这个真实的东西毕竟还容许保持一定的距离，允许享受物质上的治外法权。面对摆着真实的棋子的真实的棋盘，纯粹从身体方面来说，就可以一会儿站在桌子的这一边，一会儿站在桌子的另一边，以便一会儿从执黑的立场，一会儿从执白的立场来把握和运筹局势。但是像我这样迫不得已把向我自己进行的厮杀，要是您愿意的话，也可说是同我自己进行的厮杀投影在一个意想中的空间里。我被迫在脑子里清楚地把握住六十四个方格上每一边的阵势，此外不仅要计算出眼前的行棋，而且也要计算出对弈双方下几步可能要走的棋，确切地说，我要两倍、三倍地盘算，不，是六倍、八倍、十二倍地盘算，我要为每一个我，为黑方我和白方我预先想出四五步棋，我知道，这一切听起来是多么荒谬。请您原谅，我希望您仔细考虑一下我的这种疯癫状态。在抽象的幻想空间中下棋的时候，我作为白方棋手，同时又作为黑方棋手都得为各方预先算出四五步，也就是说，对于棋局发展进程中所出现的各种情况在一定程度上得预先跟两个脑子，跟白方的脑子和跟黑方的脑子配合好。但是即使是这种自我分裂在我这费解的试验中还不是最危险的，由于我独立想出了一些棋局，结果失去了立足之地，坠入了无底深渊。像我前几个星期所练习的那样，光是照名局来下，归终只不过是一种复制的成果，纯粹是对已有物质的重复，这并不比背诵诗歌或者默记法律条文更费劲，这是一种局限的、按部就班的活动，因而是一种绝妙的脑力训练。我上午练习两盘棋，下午练习两盘，这是规定的定额，没有一丝激动我就可以将它完成；这四盘棋是我的正常工作，再说，要是我在下棋的过程中走错了，或者走不下去了，总还可以向棋谱求教。所以对于我受了震惊的神经来说，这是很有疗效的，更能起镇静作用，因为照别人的棋局摆棋不会使自己卷进搏杀中去；管他是黑棋赢还是白棋赢，对我来说都无所谓，这是阿廖欣或波戈留波夫，是他们在争夺比赛的桂冠，而我本人，我的理智，我的心灵，仅仅是作为观众、作为行家里手在品味棋局的转折突变和赏心悦目。但是从我想跟自己搏杀的一刻起，我就下意识地开始向自己挑战了。两个我中的每一个我，黑棋我和白棋我，在互相竞争，为了自己的一方，每一个我都雄心勃勃，心浮气躁，想取胜，想赢棋；作为黑棋我每走一步心里就万分紧张，不知白棋我会怎么应对。我的两个我中的任何一个，要是另一个我走错一步棋就兴高采烈，得意扬扬，而同时对于自己的漏着则怒容满面，忧心如焚。

“这一切看起来毫无意思，事实上这种人为的精神分裂，这种意识分裂，它所带来的危险的心情激动，在正常人的正常状态下是难以想象的。但是，请您不要忘记，我是从正常状态下被强行拉出来的，是个囚犯，无辜遭到监禁，几个月来受尽别人精心策划的寂寞的折磨，早就要将他积聚起来的愤怒向任何东西发泄了。因为我没有别的东西，只有这种向自己进攻的游戏，所以便将我的愤怒，我的复仇欲望统统狂热地倾注到下棋中去。我心里有种东西自以为是，可是我又只有心里的另一个我是我能与之相搏的，所以我下棋时的激动几乎到了发狂的程度。开始我思考的时候还是不慌不忙，谨慎周到的，在一盘棋和另一盘棋之间还安排了休息时间，好让自己歇一歇，放松一下；可是渐渐地，我那被激动起来的神经就不容许我再等了。我的白棋我刚走一步，我的黑棋我就已毛毛腾腾地向前挺进了；一盘棋刚结束，我就向自己挑战，要下第二盘，因为我这两个我每次总有一个被另一个战胜而要求再下一盘，好扳回来。由于这种疯狂的贪婪心理，这几个月在我的囚室里我同自己究竟厮杀了多少盘，我连个大概数都说不出来——也许一千来盘，也许更多。这是一种我自己无法抗拒的癫狂；从早到晚，我什么也不想，想的只是象、卒、车、王和a、b、c，‘将死’和‘王车易位’等等，我整个身心都被逼到这个有格子的方块上去了，下棋的乐趣变成了下棋的欲望，下棋的欲望又变成了一种强制，一种棋瘾，一种疯狂的愤怒——不仅浸透在我清醒的时间里，而且也渐渐控制了我的睡眠。我思考的只能是下棋，只能是行棋，只能是下棋过程中出现的问题；有时我醒来，额头湿漉漉的，我断定，睡着了甚至还下意识地在继续下棋，要是我梦见了人，那这个梦一定仅仅是在动象、车的时候，在马往前跳或往后跳的时候做的。就是在被提审的时候，我也不再能明确地想到我的责任了；我感觉到，最近几次审讯的时候，我说的话一定相当的语无伦次，因为，因为审讯官们有时面面相觑，感到诧异不解。实际上，在审讯官们向我提问以及他们互相商量的时候，我心里涌动着那糟糕的欲望，只等着把我重新押回我的囚室去，好继续下棋，继续疯狂地下棋，重新下一盘，再下一盘。每次中断都会使我神经紊乱；就是看守来清扫囚室的一刻钟，给我送饭来的两分钟，也使我那狂热的急躁不安的心情大受折磨；有时候到了晚上我那盒饭还在那儿放着，碰都没有碰过，我下棋下得忘了吃饭。我肉体上能感觉到的唯有可怕的口渴；这大概是由于不停地思考，不停地下棋而上火了；一瓶水我两口就喝干了，就缠着看守，让他再给我水，但一会儿我又感到口干舌燥了。最后，下棋的时候——我从早到晚别的什么都不干——我的情绪竟激动到不再能够静静地坐上片刻的程度；我一面思考棋局，一面不停地走来走去，越走越快，棋局越是临近收尾，心情就越是急躁；那种赢棋、取胜的欲望，击败我自己的欲望，渐渐变成了一种愤怒。我焦躁不安，浑身颤抖，因为我身上一方的我总嫌另一方的我走棋太慢。一方就催促另一方；要是我身上一方的我觉得另一方的我应着不够快，我就开始骂自己：‘快，快！’或者‘往前，往前！’您也许觉得这很可笑吧。当然，我今天心里很清楚，我的这种状况完全是精神过分紧张导致的一种病态反映，对于这种病状我还找不到别的名称，只好把它叫作迄今医学上还不清楚的‘棋中毒’。后来，这种偏执的癫狂不仅开始侵蚀我的大脑，而且也开始侵蚀我的身体了。我消瘦了，睡不好觉，恍恍惚惚，每次醒来都要费好大的劲才能睁开沉甸甸的眼皮；有时我感到极度虚弱，连拿水杯手都抖得非常厉害，要费很大力气才能把杯子送到嘴边；但是一开始下棋，一股狂热的力量就来了：我紧握拳头走来走去，有时宛如透过一层红雾听见我自己的声音沙哑地、凶狠地冲着自己叫喊：‘将死了！’

“这种令人心惊胆战、难以描述的危机状况是如何出现的，我自己也说不清楚。我所知道的全部情况就是，一天早晨我醒来，觉得跟以往完全不一样。我全身像散了架似的软绵绵地躺着，舒适而安逸。一种深深的、适意的倦意，我几个月来未曾有过的倦意压着我的眼皮，是那么温暖、惬意，起先我犹犹豫豫，竟不愿把眼睛睁开。我醒着躺了几分钟，继续享受恬适的昏昏沉沉的境界，暖融融地躺着，感官陶醉在飘飘欲仙的快感之中。突然，我觉得似乎听见身后有声音，是活人的说话声，我这时心里的狂喜之情您是想象不出的，以往几个月，将近一年以来，除了法官席上那种生硬、凶狠、毒辣的话之外，我没有听到过别的声音。‘你在做梦，’我对自己说，‘你在做梦！千万不要睁开眼睛！让梦境再延续一会儿，要不然你又要看见围绕着你的那间该死的囚室，那把椅子、那个洗脸台和那图案永远不变的壁纸。你在做梦——继续做下去吧！’

“可是，好奇心还是占了上风。我慢慢地、小心翼翼地睁开眼。奇迹出现了：我处在另一个房间里，这房间比我饭店里的那间囚室宽大。窗户上没有加栅栏，阳光可以不受遮挡地照射进来，窗户外不是我那呆板的防火墙，一眼望去就可看到迎风摇曳的绿树，室内四壁光洁，雪白闪亮，我上面的天花板又白又高——真的，我躺在一张陌生的新床上，这确实不是梦，我身后有人的声音在低语。惊讶之余，我大概是不由自主地使劲动了一下，因为我马上就听到有人走来的脚步声。一个女人步履轻盈地走了过来，头发上罩着白软帽，是个看护，是护士。我惊奇得浑身打了一阵战栗：我已经有一年没有见过女人了。我愣愣地凝视着这个妩媚的身影，我的目光一定极为兴奋和狂热，因为走过来的护士急忙‘安静！请您安静！’地说着，让我平静下来。可是我只是聆听她的声音——这不是一个人在说话吗？再说还是一个柔和、温暖，简直可以说是甜美的女人的声音。真是不可思议的奇迹！我贪婪地望着她的嘴，一个人居然能怀着善意同别人说话，这在我这个在地狱里待了一年的人看来，简直是不可能的。护士朝我微笑——是的，她在微笑，居然还有人会善意地微笑——接着她把食指压着嘴唇，意思是让我别出声，然后就轻声地走了。但是我却不能听从她的命令。这个奇迹我还没有看够呢。我硬是想在床上坐起来，好看看她的背影，看看这个善良的人性之奇迹。我想在床沿上欠身坐起来，但未能做到。另外，我感觉到右手的手指和手腕那儿有点儿不对劲，有一个厚厚的大白卷，显然是用很多绷带包扎起来了。我惊奇地望着我手上厚厚的、奇怪的白色包扎，先是摸不着头脑，随后我慢慢开始明白了我在哪儿，并开始思索我自己究竟出了什么事。一定是他们把我打伤了，或者是我自己弄伤了手。我正躺在一家医院里。

“中午大夫来了。他是位和气的、年纪较大的先生。他知道我们家的姓，并非常尊敬地提到我当御医的叔叔，我马上就感觉到，他对我是一片好意。在随后的交谈中，他向我提出了各种各样的问题，尤其是一个使我感到惊讶的问题：我是不是数学家或者化学家。我说都不是。

“‘怪了，’他喃喃地说，‘您发烧的时候老是大声嚷着一些奇怪的公式——c3、c4什么的。我们大家都听不懂。’

“我向他打听，我究竟出了什么事。他意味深长地笑笑。

“‘不很严重。是神经急性刺激。’他先是小心翼翼地往四处看了看，然后轻声补充说，‘这毕竟是可以理解的。在三月十三日[26]之后，是吧？’

“我点点头。

“‘碰上他们使的这种方法，神经受点刺激并不奇怪，’他喃喃地说，‘您并不是第一个。不过您放心好了。’

“看到他悄悄叫我放心的那种态度以及他对我劝慰的目光，我知道，在他这儿我是非常安全的。

“两天以后，这位好心的大夫相当坦率地把事情发生的经过告诉了我。那天，看守听见我在囚室里大喊大叫，开始他以为有人进了我的屋，我在同此人吵架。他刚到房门口，我就朝他扑了过去，冲着他大喊大叫，嘴里喊着‘跑啊，你这恶棍，你这胆小鬼！’诸如此类的话，并想卡住他的脖子，最后我发了狂似的向他袭击，他不得不大喊救命。我正处于疯狂状态，后来他们就把我拖来让大夫检查，我大概突然挣脱了，就朝走廊里的窗户扑去，打破玻璃，把自己的手割破了——您看这里还有个很深的疤。在医院里的头几夜，我是在大脑极度兴奋的状态下度过的，不过现在他觉得我的意识完全清醒了。‘当然，’他悄悄补充说，‘这一点我还是不向这帮先生报告为好，否则到头来他们又要把您送回到那儿去了。请您相信我，我会尽力而为的。’

“这位乐于助人的大夫是怎么向那些折磨我的人汇报我的情况的，我不得而知。反正他达到了想要达到的目的：把我释放。可能是他说，我神经已经错乱，或者也许在此期间对盖世太保来说，我已经无足轻重了，因为希特勒在那以后已经占领了波希米亚[27]，这样，对他来说，奥地利事件就算了结了。这样，我就只需签个字，保证在十四天内离开我们的祖国。这十四天我为办理一个以前的世界公民今天出国所必需的成千项手续而奔忙：军方和警方的同意证明、税务证明、申请护照、办签证、办健康证明等等，因而没有时间对往事多加思考。看来我们大脑里有一些力量在神秘地起着调节作用，会自动排除那些使我们灵魂讨厌的和对我们灵魂具有危险的东西，因为每当我要回忆我被囚禁的那段日子，我的脑子就有几分糊涂；直到好几个星期以后，实际上是上了这艘船之后，我才重新找到勇气，静下心来思考自己身上所发生的事。

“现在您一定会理解，为什么我对您的朋友们的态度会那么不得体，或许还让人百思不得其解呢。我确实完全是闲逛偶然经过吸烟室才看见您的朋友们坐在那里下棋的；我又惊又怕，感觉到我的脚像长了根似的不由自主地站立在那里。因为我全忘了可以在一个真正的棋盘前用真正的棋子下棋，全忘了下棋的时候有两个完全不同的人真真切切互相面对面地坐着。我用了好几分钟才想起，这两个棋手在那里下的，其实同我在束手待毙的情况下跟我自己下了好几个月的那种棋是一回事。我发现，我疯狂地练习时所使用的那些密码只是这些骨制棋子的代替和象征；让我感到惊喜的是，棋子在棋盘上的移动同我在思维空间中假想的走步是一样的，正如一位天文学家用复杂的方法在纸上算出了一颗新行星，后来果真在天空中看到了这颗皎洁晶莹的星星的实体。我的惊喜同那位天文学家的惊喜大概很相似。我像是被磁铁吸住了，凝视着棋盘，望着那儿我的棋图——马、象、王、后、卒等木雕的真实棋子；为了看清这局棋的阵势，我不得不下意识地先将这些棋子从我那抽象的符号世界里退出来，进入活动棋子的世界中来。好奇心渐渐主宰了我，想观看两位棋手之间真正的较量。这就发生了很尴尬的事，我竟把礼数忘到了九霄云外，参与到你们的棋局中来了。但是您的朋友那步昏着像在我心里捅了一刀。我阻止他走那一步，这纯粹是一种本能行为，是感情冲动的表现，正如一个人看到一个孩子弓身挂在栏杆上，就不假思索地将他一把抓住一样。后来我才意识到，我一性急就贸然行事，这有多么唐突。”

我赶忙对B博士说，通过这件偶然的事能与他相识，我们大家都很高兴，对我来说，在听了他向我吐露种种情况后，要是在明天的临时棋赛上能见到他出场，定会兴趣倍增。B博士听了，做了个不安的动作。

“可别这么说，您真的不要对我抱过多的希望。对我来说，这不过是试一试罢了……试试我到底能不能正常地下棋，能不能用实实在在的棋子同一个活跃着生命力的人在真正的棋盘上对弈……因为我现在越来越怀疑我下过的几百盘，或许是数千盘棋是否真正符合国际象棋的规则，会不会仅仅是一种梦里的棋，一种谵妄棋，一种谵妄游戏，做这种游戏总像是在梦里一样，许多中间阶段都跳过去了。希望您不是当真指望让我不自量力，竟以为能与国际象棋大师，而且是当今世界第一高手较量一番，但愿您对此不要抱有认真的指望。使我感到兴趣并让我全力以赴的，仅仅是一种事后的好奇心，想证实一下我那时在囚室里是在下棋还是已经疯了，我当时是处在危险的暗礁之前，还是已经到了它的另一面——仅此而已，只是仅此而已。”

这时船尾响起了进晚餐的锣声。我们聊了几乎两个小时了，B博士对我讲的，要比我在这里归纳的多得多。我衷心向他表示感谢，并向他告辞。但是我刚走上甲板，他就从后面追了来，他激动地、甚至有点结结巴巴地补充说：

“还有件事！请您马上先转告诸位先生，免得我到时候显得没有礼貌；我只下一盘……就让这盘棋把旧账画上个句号——彻底了结，而不是新的开始……我不想第二次染上如痴如狂的棋瘾，这种棋瘾现在回想起来都感到胆战心惊……还有，还有，当时大夫警告过我……郑重其事地警告过我。对某种东西染上了瘾，永远存在着危险，中过棋毒的人即使已经治好了，最好还是不要挨近棋盘……所以，您明白——只下一盘棋，对我自己做个试验，绝不多下。”

第二天，在约定的时间三点钟，我们大家都准时聚集在吸烟室里。我们这边又增加了两位“国王游戏”的爱好者，他们是船上的高级海员，是专门向船上请了假来看比赛的。岑托维奇也没有像昨天那样让别人等他。按照规定挑好了棋子的颜色之后，这场值得纪念的、由Homo obscurissimus[28]对著名的世界冠军的国际象棋比赛就开始了。可是很遗憾，这盘棋只是为我们这些外行观众下的，其进展情况没有保存，没有载入国际象棋年鉴，就像贝多芬的一些钢琴即兴曲没有留下乐谱一样。尽管我们在以后的几个下午想一起根据记忆将这盘棋复原，结果是白折腾一场；也许在棋赛进行过程中我们对两位棋手倾注了过多的热情，因而忽视了棋局的进程。因为两位棋手在外表上表现出来的智力差异，在棋局进行过程中愈来愈在形体上显得清楚。岑托维奇这位行家在整个比赛时间里像块石头，一动不动，两眼低垂，紧盯棋盘；在他来说，思考的时候简直像要付出体力似的，使他全部器官不得不高度集中。相反，B博士的举止轻松自如，无拘无束。作为真正的业余爱好者，B博士的身体是完全放松的，就业余爱好者这个词的最美好的意义上来说，下棋只是游戏，是令人快乐的游戏。在头几步棋的间隙时间里，他在闲聊中给我们讲棋，并潇洒地点着一支烟，只有轮到他走的时候，他才往棋盘上看上一分钟。他每次都给别人这样的印象，仿佛他早就在等着对手的这步棋了。

开局的几步熟套棋下得相当快。到了第七或第八回合一个明确的计划好像才出来。岑托维奇考虑的时间越来越长，由此我们感到，争取优势的真正战斗开始了。说实话，局势的渐渐发展像真正比赛时的每盘棋一样，对我们这些外行来说是相当失望的。因为棋子越是相互交织，形成一个特殊图案，我们对真正的情况就越是捉摸不透。我们既搞不清这位棋手的目的何在，不明白另一位有何打算，也不知道两人之中哪位是先手。我们只看到一个个棋子像起重机似的在挪动，想砸开敌阵，但是他们这样来来往往有何战略意图，我们却不得而知，因为慎重的棋手每走一步都要预先推断出好几步。另外，我们渐渐感到一种令人瘫痪的疲倦，这主要是由于岑托维奇考虑的时间拖得没完没了引起的，这显然也开始激怒了我们的朋友。我心情不安地发现，这盘棋时间拉得越长，他在椅子上心神不宁地动得越厉害。由于烦躁不安，他一会儿一支接一支地抽着烟，一会儿又抓起铅笔记点什么。接着他又要了一瓶矿泉水，心急火燎地把水一杯杯灌下肚去；显然，他的推断要比岑托维奇快一百倍。每次，岑托维奇没完没了地考虑以后，决定用他笨重的手将一个子往前一挪，我们的朋友就像见到期待已久的事情终于发生了一样，随即微微一笑，马上就应了一着。他的判断力极其神速，脑袋里一定把对方的一切可能性都预先计算出来了；因此，岑托维奇思考的时间越长，他就越发心烦意乱，在等待的时候他的嘴边强压着一股子火气，几乎是一股子敌意。可是岑托维奇却仍然不慌不忙。他顽固地思索着，默不作声，棋盘上的棋子越少，他琢磨的时间就越长。到第二十四个回合就已足足下了两小时四十五分钟，我们大家已经坐得疲惫不堪，对棋台上的进展几乎无动于衷了。船上的高级海员一个已经走了，另一个拿着本书在看，只是在棋手走子的时候才抬头瞥上一眼。可是等到岑托维奇的一步棋一走，这时意想不到的事突然发生了。B博士一发现岑托维奇抓住马要往前跳，就像准备扑跳的猫一样弓缩着身子。他浑身开始发抖，岑托维奇的马一跳，他就把后狠狠地往前一推，以胜利的姿态大声说：“好！结束战斗！”说完便将身子往后一靠，双臂交叉搁在胸前，并以挑战的眼光看着岑托维奇。他的瞳孔里突然闪烁着一团灼热的光。

我们大家不由得都俯下身来看着棋盘，想搞清以胜利者的姿态高声宣布的这一步棋。第一眼看不出有什么直接的威胁。那么我们朋友的话一定是就局势的发展而言的，而这一发展我们这些考虑得不远的业余爱好者还计算不出来。听到那挑衅性的宣告，岑托维奇是我们中唯一不动声色的人；他平心静气地坐着，仿佛压根儿没有听见“结束战斗！”这句侮辱性的话似的。室内没有任何反应。因为我们大家下意识地屏住了呼吸，所以那只放在桌上做计时用的闹钟的滴答声一下子听得清清楚楚。三分钟，七分钟，八分钟——岑托维奇一动不动，可是我觉得，由于心里紧张，他厚厚的鼻孔似乎张得更宽了。对于这种默默的等待，我们的朋友似乎也同我们一样觉得难以忍受。他突然站了起来，开始在吸烟室里走来走去，起先走得很慢，后来越走越快，越走越快。我们大家都有些奇怪地望着他，不过谁也没有我着急，因为我注意到，虽然他走来走去显得很急，然而他的脚步所迈经的那个空间范围每次都是一样的，这就仿佛他在空荡荡的房间里每次都碰到一个看不见的障碍物，迫使他不得不往回走。我不禁打了个冷战，我发现，他这样走来走去，无意中重现了他从前那间囚室的尺寸：在他被囚禁的几个月中一定也是这样，双手抽搐，肩膀蜷缩，同关在笼子里的动物一样跑来跑去；他在那儿一定就是这样，就只能是这样来来往往跑了上千次，在他僵呆而兴奋的目光里闪烁着发狂的红光。不过他的思维能力看来尚未受到损伤，因为他不时烦躁地朝棋桌转过脸去，看看岑托维奇此刻是否做出了决定。九分钟，十分钟过去了。这时终于发生了我们之中谁也没有料到的事。岑托维奇缓缓抬起他那只一直一动不动地搁在棋桌上的手。我们大家都紧张地注视着他将作出的决断。然而岑托维奇没有走子，而是翻过手，手背果断地一推，将所有的棋子慢慢拨出棋盘。过了一会儿我们才明白：岑托维奇放弃了这盘棋。为了免得当着我们的面明显地被将死，他缴械了。难以置信的事发生了，世界冠军、无数次比赛的折桂者，在一个无名之辈面前，在一个已有二十年或者二十五年没有碰过棋盘的人面前卷起了旗帜。我们的这位匿名朋友，棋界的无名小卒，在公开比赛中战胜了当今世界国际象棋第一高手！

不知不觉中我们激动得一个个都站了起来。我们每个人都觉得，B博士一定会说点或做点什么来疏导一下我们快乐的受到惊吓的情绪。唯一纹丝不动地保持着镇定的便是岑托维奇。过了一阵，他抬起头来，用冷漠的目光望着我们的朋友。

“还下一盘吗？”他问道。

“当然。”B博士回答，他那种热情让我感到很不对头。我还没来得及提醒他自己下的“只下一盘”的决定，他就已经坐下了，并开始急急忙忙地把棋子重新摆好。他将棋子集拢的时候是那么激动，以致一个卒子两次从他哆哆嗦嗦的手指间滑到地上；我原先心里就极不好受，现在见他很不自然的激动神情，我心里非常害怕。因为他本是个文质彬彬、温文尔雅的人，现在显然兴奋过度；他嘴角上的抽搐也更频繁，他像发了高烧，全身不住地颤抖。

“别下了！”我在他耳边悄悄说，“现在别下了！您今天已经够了！对您来说，这太费神了。”

“费神！哈哈哈……”他恶狠狠地放声大笑，“要不是这么磨蹭，这期间我都可以下十七盘了！这么慢的速度，又不好睡着，这才是唯一让我费神的呢！——行了！这回您开棋吧！”

最后这几句话他是对岑托维奇说的，语调激烈，近乎粗鲁。岑托维奇静静地、泰然自若地望着他，但是他冷漠的目光似乎是一只攥紧的拳头。突然，两位棋手之间出现了新的情况：危险的紧张气氛和强烈的仇恨。现在已不再是两位互相一比高低的棋手，而是两个敌人，都发誓要把对方消灭。岑托维奇犹豫了很长时间才走第一步棋，我明显地感到，他是有意拖那么长时间的。显然，这位训练有素的战略家已经发现，恰恰是由于他下得慢才弄得对手筋疲力尽和烦躁不安的。因此他用了至少有四分钟，才走了一步最普通、最简单的开局棋：按常规把王前卒往前挪两格。我们的朋友立即以王前卒向迎，可是岑托维奇又做了一次没完没了的停顿，简直让人难以忍受；这就像天上划过一道强烈的闪电，大家心里怦怦直跳，等着惊雷，可是惊雷就是不下来。岑托维奇一动不动。他静静地、慢慢地思索着，我越来越确定地感觉到，他这慢是恶毒的；不过这倒给了我充裕的时间去对B博士进行观察。他刚把第三杯水喝下；我不由自主地想到，他给我讲过在囚室里感到一种发高烧似的口渴。这时他身上已经明显地出现了所有反常的激动的征兆；我看见他的额头潮湿了，手上的伤疤比先前更红更显著了。但是他还控制着自己。到了第四个回合，岑托维奇考虑起来又是没完没了，这下B博士沉不住气了。

“总得走棋呀！”

岑托维奇抬起头，冷冷地看着他。“据我所知，我们是约定的，每步棋有十分钟思考时间的呀！我下棋，原则上都不少于这个时间。”

B博士紧紧咬着嘴唇。我发现，在桌底下，他的脚烦乱地、越来越烦乱地摆来摆去往地板上蹭。我有一种预感，觉得他身上正在酝酿着某种荒唐的东西。这种预感压得我喘不过气来，使我自己也无法阻挡地变得越来越神经质了。事实上，下到第八个回合又发生了一个风波。B博士等啊等，等得越来越不能自制，他再也无法抑制自己的张力了；他坐在那儿不停地来回晃动，而且禁不住开始用手指头敲着桌子。岑托维奇抬起他那沉重的乡巴佬式的脑袋。

“可以请您别捶桌子吗？这对我是个打搅。这样我无法下棋。”

“哈哈！”B博士短短地笑了一声，“这一点倒是都看见了。”

岑托维奇涨红着脸，严厉而带着恶意地问道：“您这话是什么意思？”B博士又短短地、幸灾乐祸地笑了起来。“没有什么意思。只不过您显然非常不耐烦了。”

岑托维奇没有吭声，低下了脑袋。

过了七分钟他才走子。这盘棋就是以这种慢死人的速度继续进行着。岑托维奇常常在发愣，而且似乎越来越厉害，后来他总是到约定思考时间的最大限度时才决定走一步棋，而从一个间歇到另一个间歇，我们朋友的举止变得越来越奇怪。看来他似乎毫不关心这盘棋，而是在忙于别的事呢。他不再焦灼地跑来跑去，而是一动不动地坐在他的座位上。他的眼睛直瞪瞪地、几乎是迷乱地凝视着前面的虚空，不停地喃喃自语，说的话谁也不懂；他不是沉湎在没完没了的棋阵组合，就是在创造另一些新的棋局——我怀疑他是在想新棋局——因为在岑托维奇终于走了一步棋之后，每次都得别人提醒B博士，把他从心不在焉的状态中叫回来。随后他每次都只需一分钟了解一下局势；我越来越怀疑，处在这种突然剧烈发作的冷冰冰的精神错乱状态中，其实他早把岑托维奇和我们大家忘掉了。果然，下到第九个回合，危机就爆发了。岑托维奇刚一落子，B博士连棋盘都没有好好瞅一眼，便突然把他的象向前挺进三格，并喊了起来，声音大得把我们大家吓了一跳：

“将！将军！”

大家怀着希望看到一步妙着的心情，立即一齐注视着棋盘。但是一分钟以后所发生的情况，我们谁也没有料到。岑托维奇缓慢地、非常缓慢地抬起头，把我们这群人一个挨一个看了一遍，此前他从未这样做过。他显出一副得意扬扬的神气，他的嘴唇上渐渐开始浮现出一丝得意的、嘲讽的微笑。一直等到他把他这个我们仍不理解的胜利充分享受以后，才带着虚假的客套朝我们这帮人转过脸来。

“遗憾——我可看不出有‘将’的棋。也许哪位先生看出对我的王构成了将军？”

我们望着棋盘，随后又不安地看着B博士。岑托维奇的王格确实有一个卒保护着，挡住了对方的象，也就是说，对王构不成将军，这样的棋是孩子都能看得出的。我们心里都很不安。难道是我们的朋友情急之中走偏了一个子，走远了一格还是走近了一格？我们的沉默引起了B博士的注意。现在他眼睛盯着棋盘，开始急躁地、结结巴巴地说：

“但是王确实应该在f7上呀……它的位置错了，完全错了。您走错了！棋盘上所有的棋子位置全错了……这个卒应该在g5上，而不该在f4……这完全是另一盘棋呀……”

他突然顿住了。我使劲抓住他的胳膊，确切地说，我是在狠狠地掐他的胳膊，他虽然正处在激动不安的迷惘中，大概还是感觉到我在掐他。他转过脸来，像个梦游者似的紧紧望着我。

“您……想干什么？”

我只说了句“Remember！”[29]别的什么都没说，同时用手指触了触他手上的疤。他下意识地跟着我的动作做了一遍，目光呆滞地望着自己手上那道血红的伤痕。接着他突然开始颤抖起来，全身起了一阵寒战。

“上帝保佑，”他苍白的嘴唇悄声说道，“我说了什么荒唐话，做了什么荒唐事吗……到头来我又……？”

“没有。”我对他悄悄耳语，“但是您得立即中断这盘棋，现在是关键时刻。请您想一想大夫对您说的话！”

B博士猛地站了起来。“请原谅我的愚蠢的错误，”他以往日那种客客气气的声音说，并向岑托维奇鞠了一躬，“当然，刚才我纯粹是胡说八道。这盘棋理所当然是您赢了。”接着他又转向我们。“我也要请诸位先生原谅。不过我预先告诫过你们，要你们不要对我抱太多期望。请原谅我的出丑——这是我最后一次试下国际象棋。”他鞠了一躬就走了，他的神情和先前出现时一样，谦虚而神秘。只有我知道，此人何以再也不会去碰棋盘，而其他人还都有点迷惑不解地呆在那里，心里隐隐约约地感觉到，在千钧一发之际避免了一场极不愉快和极其危险的冲突。“Damned fool！”[30]麦克康纳在失望之余叽里咕噜地骂了一句。岑托维奇最后一个从座位上站起来，还朝那盘下了一半的棋看了一眼。

“可惜，”他大度地说，“这个进攻计划一点不坏。对一位业余爱好者来说，这位先生的天赋委实是异乎寻常的。”

THE BURNING SECRET


A PARTNER

THE engine gave a hoarse shriek as the express drew up at Semmering station. A moment of silence followed, during which the carriages rested in the translucent mountain air. The train belched forth a traveller or two and swallowed down a couple of fresh arrivals. Peppery exclamations shuttlecocked to and fro. Again the locomotive uttered a raucous cry as it started off, dragging a dark serpent behind it, to disappear into the tunnel’s maw. A healing peace once more pervaded the landscape, and the windswept atmosphere was good to breathe.

One of the men who had stepped out of the train was young, and of agreeable aspect. He was stylishly dressed and debonair, with an elasticity of gait which brought him to the cabstand well in advance of the other passengers. He engaged the solitary vehicle, and was conveyed without haste to the hotel he had selected. Spring was in the air. A few white clouds, glinting and glowing in the sky, such clouds as are seen only in the months of May and June, seemed to be playing at catch-ascatch-can in the blue, only to hide themselves from the observer’s eye behind the scaling mountains, there to embrace and flee, to wave a lilywhite hand, as it were, then to melt away into nothingness, reappear, and finally to settle down as night-caps on the neighbouring hills.

A restless, insurgent wind rustled among the lean and raindrenched trees, so that their limbs groaned, and thousands of waterdrops were scattered on the ground. Chill currents of snow-laden air descended from the peaks, until one caught one’s breath in the keen, sharp atmosphere. The heavens and the earth were both in a yeasty ferment of impatience. The cab rattled along to the accompaniment of the leisurely trot of the horses and the silvery tinkle of the bells with which the harness was adorned.

On arriving at the hotel the young man’s first move was to consult the list of guests. Not a name that he knew was to be found!

“What the devil have I come here for?” he communed. “No office could be worse than this lonesome place with not a soul for company. Obviously I am too early in the season or too late. My vacations never seem to strike it lucky. Not a creature of my acquaintance among the whole bally lot of them. At least one or two women might have graced the list, so that I could have whiled away my one short week in a mild flirtation.”

The youth, a scion of the minor Austrian nobility and employeem the Treasury, had decided to give himself this week’s holiday, not because he was in need of a rest but because his colleagues were off on a jaunt and he did not see why he should not follow their example. Though by no means lacking in philosophical capacity, Baron Otto von Sternfeldt was essentially of a sociable disposition, and was popular in the circles he frequented. He found solitude irksome, soon tired of his own company, and avoided every occasion for being alone since he felt scant inclination to get to know himself better. If his talents were to flourish, the warmth of his heart to glow into a flame, and his natural high spirits to find vent, he needed constantly to rub shoulders with men and women. By himself he felt cold and lifeless like a match unlighted in a box.

He now wandered aimlessly about in the empty lounge, disconsolately fingering the papers and magazines; then he tried the music-room and strummed a waltz on the piano, but his fingers were stiff and clumsy, refusing to impart the necessary swing and rhythm to the tune. Utterly depressed, he threw himself into an easy-chair and stared out of the window. The evening was drawing in, and grey mistwreaths lurked among the pines. For a full hour, he remained drearily watching the gathering shadows. Then he decided to go into the diningroom.

Very few tables were laid; and he cast a hasty glance at the persons sitting over their meal. Not a friend or an acquaintance to be seen! Ah, yes, over there was a face he knew—but it was merely that of a professional trainer to whom he gave a nod. Women there were none; not a sign of anything worth the attention of a charming young gentleman on pleasure bent. His vexation swelled into impatience.

Sternfeldt belonged to the category of those whose face is a fortune; one took a liking to him at first sight. He was always eager for new experiences, fresh adventures; he was never taken off his guard, because he kept perpetually on the alert to seize the skirts of happy chance; Cupid stood ready at his elbow to give him a hint at the first approach of amorous possibilities; he looked at every woman, be she the wife of a friend or the chambermaid who opened his bedroom door for him, with a searching eye which seemed to unclothe her. It is customary to call such men “Women hunters,” and there is much penetrating wisdom in the appellation, for they actually do possess many of the instincts of the huntsman, passionately stalking their prey, enjoying the excitement of bringing the quarry to bay, and revelling in the spiritual cruelty of the kill. They are perpetually ambushed for the spring, and refuse to give up the chase until the game is theirs. Passion swamps their whole being; not the passion of a lover, but the passion of a gambler, which is cool, calculating, and dangerous. Some continue thus their whole life long, persistent adventurers in the field of“love,” persons whose days are divided into countless petty and lustful episodes—a significant glance in passing, a suggestive smile, a touch of the knee to a neighbour at table—and the year is made up of hundreds of such days wherein sensuality is the main ingredient.

That evening, the baron found no one to take a hand in his favourite sport; and there is nothing so exasperating to the temper of a gamester as to sit with the cards in his hand awaiting the arrival of a partner. Otto asked the waiter to bring him a newspaper. His eyes ran down the columns and over the headlines; but his mind was elsewhere, and he read as though his senses were benumbed by drink.

Then a skirt rustled behind him, and he heard a clear voice say somewhat irritably and with an affectation of culture:

“Mais tais-toi donc, Edgar!”

A tall, finely built woman in a silk dress passed followed by a boy with a pale face and eyes filled with vague curiosity which seemed to caress his companion’s form. The couple sat down at a table reserved for them. Edgar was obviously on his best behaviour, and yet the restlessness in his dark eyes betrayed his real feelings. The lady—and she it was who absorbed the whole of the baron’s interest—was well groomed and dressed with taste. She was a type that the young man admired being a not too buxom Jewess just past the prime but not as yet blowzy, a woman still capable of passion, though keeping her natural sensuousness veiled behind an outward decorum. At first he was denied a look into her eyes, for she kept the lids resolutely lowered; but he could contemplate at leisure the arch of her brows meeting delicately over her finely chiselled nose, which, though it betrayed her race, gave a noble grace to a clear-cut and interesting profile. Her hair was as abundant and feminine as the other charms of the flesh, and swept in opulent waves over her head. She possessed the assurance of a woman whose beauty has been the open delight of everyone with whom she has come in contact. Her voice was soft and low as she gave her orders to the waiter and told her son, who was fiddling with his spoon and fork, to remember his manners and to sit still. Seemingly indifferent to what was going on around her she appeared to ignore the baron’s cautious scrutiny—though in reality her masked interest in him had been awakened by the fact that he was frankly interested in her.

The cloud upon the young man’s spirit had dispersed, and his face was serene. Lines and wrinkles of annoyance were smoothed away, his muscles became taut, the blood flooded his skin and gave it renewed life, his eyes sparkled. Having many a feminine attribute in his nature, he responded to the presence of an attractive woman, as a woman responds to the presence of a man. Sensuous pleasure stretched his energies to the full. The hunter scented the game. His eyes challenged hers to the tourney. But she, though giving him a furtive glance, refused to look him in the face and thus to pick up the gauntlet. It seemed to him, however, that a hint of a smile might be detected flitting around the corners of her mouth. He could not be sure, and this excited him the more. What contented him was the fact that she deliberately avoided his eyes. A good sign, he thought, for it might be interpreted as defiance and at the same time as embarrassment. Besides, her preoccupation with the child was too meticulous, and must undoubtedly be aimed at the onlooker. Nor was her conversation with the lad quite natural; she seemed, rather, to be talking at her observant neighbour. The forced repose of her manner was, Otto felt, the mark of an initial uneasiness.

His feelings were roused. The hunt was on. He lingered over his meal, staring at the woman incessantly during a full hour until at length he could have drawn every curve of her face, while his eyes had secretly caressed each nook and fold of her splendid body. A heavy shroud of darkness had fallen over the countryside, blotting out the forest whose trees continued to sob as though they were frightened children, for the rainclouds were stretching eager fingers towards them grey and full of menace. Shadows had gathered in the corners of the room, and an oppressive silence hung like a pall upon the groups clustered round the dining-tables. Sternfeldt noticed that the lady’s chatter with her son became more and more forced under the burden of this silence, became more and more artificial and soon would have to cease. A test occurred to his mind. He got up, and, walking very slowly, with his eyes glued on the window, he passed close to her without giving her a glance, and disappeared through the doorway. Suddenly he reappeared as if he had forgotten something and had come back to fetch it. She was caught in the trap, for he found that she had been gazing with lively interest at his retreating figure.

Baron Otto von Sternfeldt was enchanted at the success of his ruse, and waited patiently in the entrance hall. She soon came out of the dining-room holding her boy by the hand, fluttering the pages of some magazines as she passed the big hall table, and showed a few of the illustrations to the little boy. As if by chance, the baron too, approached the table, pretending he wanted to read a paper but in reality that he might get another glimpse into those lustrous eyes, perhaps, even, say a word or two....However, the woman turned abruptly away not deigning to give him so much as a glance. She tapped her son lightly on the shoulder, saying with affectionate decision.

“Viens, Edgar. Au lit!”

A trifle crestfallen, Otto stared after her. He had fully expected to make acquaintance that very night. The postponement was a disappointment. And yet, it must be agreed, the situation was not lacking in charm. A zest had been added to the adventure. The incident goaded him to enhance desire. He had to admit that a partner had come his way, and he could now play his hand.

FRIENDSHIP

When the baron stepped into the hall next morning, he saw the boy engaged in conversation with the two lift attendants who were showing him the pictures in one of Karl May’s juvenile books. Since his mother was not present, it might be inferred that she was still engrossed in the cares of her person. For the first time, Sternfeldt took conscious notice of the child, who appeared to be about twelve years old, underdeveloped, shy, nervous, jerky in his movements, and possessed of a pair of dark, roving eyes. Like so many youngsters of his age, he gave the impression of being scared, as if he had suddenly been roused from sleep and placed in unfamiliar surroundings. He was by no means plain, but his face was still undifferentiated; the struggle between the man that was to be and the child that had been was hardly begun; his features were moulded but not finally set; there was no clear line, no striking silhouette, only a pale and somewhat uncouth mass. In addition, being at the awkward age, his clothes did not seem to belong to him; his thin arms and frail legs were lost in the folds of jacket and trousers; he lacked interest in his appearance.

The lad created a very poor impression. He was constantly getting in the way. At one moment it was the hall-porter who pushed him aside; at another he would be mixed up in the revolving door. The outer world was unfriendly. But he tried to compensate for this by futile and incessant chatter with the hotel servants. When they had time they would endeavour to answer his numerous questions, but would break off as soon as possible and go about their business. The baron contemplated the boy, a compassionate smile curling his lips. Poor child, he examined everything with curiosity, only to be fobbed off with roughness. If another human eye caught his inquisitive look, he would cringe away, unhappy at being observed, miserable that he had been detected in the act of investigating. Sternfeldt was amused; he began to feel his interest waxing. Then a thought struck him: why not make friends with the lad and utilize this friendship in order to get acquainted with the mother? It was only fear that made the youngster so shy. Well, a fellow could try. Unobtrusively he followed Edgar, who had gone outside and was stroking the soft nose of a cab-horse. Ill-luck dogged him even in this innocent pastime, for the cabby unceremoniously ordered him to leave the beast alone. Ruffled and bored, Edgar was again reduced to standing about with his vacant expression of countenance, not knowing what next to be at.

The baron seized his chance, and said in a jovial voice:

“Well, young man, how do you like this place?”

The boy flushed, and looked up anxiously. He rubbed his hands on the seat of his trousers in his embarrassment. This was his first experience of a gentleman opening conversation with him.

“Very much, thank you,” he answered awkwardly, gulping down the last two words.

“You surprise me. I should say it was a rotten hole, especially for a young man such as you. What on earth can you find to do all day?”

The boy was still too flustered to find a speedy response. How was it possible that this stranger should take notice of a small boy about whom nobody ever bothered? He felt immensely shy and immensely proud likewise of what was happening to him. With an effort he pulled himself together.

“I like reading, and we go for walks. Sometimes we hire a carriage for a drive. I’ve been ill, and Mother brought me here for my health. The doctor said I was to sit about a lot in the sun.”

As he spoke, an accent of self-confidence came into his voice. Children are invariably proud of their illnesses, for they guess that the danger makes them doubly important to their relatives.

“Yes the sun is most beneficial for a young gentleman in your state of health. You ought to burn to a fine brown. But it’s not good to be sitting about all day. A big boy like you would do better to go for rambles on his own, to be a bit uppish, and to play all kinds of pranks. It seems to me you are too obedient and well behaved. You look like a regular bookworm, always going about with a ponderous tome tucked under your arm. When I think of the young scamp I was at your age...Why, d’you know, every evening I came home with torn breeches;a terrible pickle I was in. No use for a man to be too good.”

In spite of himself Edgar smiled, and on the instant his shyness vanished. He would have loved to respond to the baron’s advances, but was afraid of appearing cheeky. How friendly this smartly tailored gentleman was! It was splendid to be talking on equal terms with him. The boy’s pleasure in the encounter tied his tongue for very happiness. What would he not have given to find suitable words to continue the conversation! But his thoughts were in a whirl. As luck would have it, the hotel manager’s Saint Bernard loped by at this crucial moment. Then it stopped still, came to sniff both boy and man, allowed itself to be patted and fondled.

“D’you like dogs?” the baron inquired abruptly.

“Very much. Grandma has one at her place in Baden, and when we go there on a visit he spends the whole day with me. It’s topping. But we’re only there in summer.”

“I’ve a couple of dozen dogs on my estate, and maybe I’ll give you one, a brown chap with white ears, little more than a puppy, but well trained. How’d you like that?”

The lad blushed with delight.

“Fine!” he exclaimed spontaneously. But then a revulsion of feeling overtook him, and he stuttered bashfully: “But Mother will never agree. She hates dogs about the house, they make so much work.”

The baron chuckled, well pleased, for he had at length guided the talk on to the lady who interested him.

“Is your mother very strict?”

Edgar reflected for a moment, looked up at his new friend questioningly as if to see whether the stranger could be trusted, and then answered cautiously:

“No, can’t exactly say she’s strict. She lets me do anything I like just now because I’ve been ill. Perhaps she’d let me have a dog...”

“Shall I put in a good word for you?”

“Oh, golly!” cried the boy delightedly. “She’d be sure to agree. What’s the dog like? White ears, did you say? Can he beg and retrieve?”

“He can do any and every trick you can think of.”

It was tickling to Otto’s vanity to watch the spark he had kindled in the youngster’s eyes. All trace of shyness disappeared; and the child’s spontaneity, no longer crippled by anxiety and fear, bubbled up like a spring of fresh water. The awkward boy had been replaced by a natural and exuberant creature. If only the mother could prove similar to her son, thought the baron. A score of questions were showered upon him at this instant by the youth.

“What’s it called?”

“Caro.”

“Caro! Caro!”

Edgar seemed to revel in the word, and to be intoxicated with delight at having acquired a friend so unexpectedly. The baron himself was no little surprised at his easy conquest, and decided to strike while the iron was hot. He invited Edgar to go for a stroll, and the lad, who for weeks had hungered after companionship, was in the seventh heaven of delight. He gave free rein to his tongue, responding innocently to his new friend’s subtle questions and assumed interest. It was not long before the baron knew all he needed concerning the family: that Edgar was the only son of a Viennese lawyer belonging to the well-to-do Jewish stratum. Plying the boy with adroit questions, he further learned that the mother was not particularly pleased with their stay in Semmering, that she had grumbled at the lack of society. Moreover, it would appear from the evasive answers given by Edgar that Mother was not particularly fond of Father, so that Sternfeldt surmised the situation to a nicety. He felt almost ashamed of himself for extracting these scraps of information thus easily from his decoy who, unused to finding anyone interested in what he had to say, allowed himself to be inveigled into confidence after confidence. Edgar’s youthful heart beat quick with pride, especially when, in the course of the walk the baron took his arm affectionately. It was an infinite delight for the child to be seen in such company. Soon he forgot his juvenility, and prattled disingenuously as to an equal. His conversation proved him to be a bright lad, somewhat precocious intellectually as is usual with sickly children who pass a large part of their time among elders, and prone to like or to dislike persons and things to excess. He seemed, so far as his emotional life was concerned, to be unbalanced, feeling either hatred towards or passionate love for objects and individuals. The golden mean did not exist for him and his tender face would at times become contorted with the excess of his emotions. There was something wild and resilient in his mode of expression which coloured his words with fanatical ardour, and his gawkiness might possibly be explained as an outcome of a painfully repressed anxiety at the violence of his own passions.

The baron soon won Edgar’s confidence. In half an hour he held the child’s warm and palpitating heart in his hand. Children are so easily hoaxed, for grown-ups seldom try to ingratiate themselves and when they do they catch the innocents unawares. Sternfeldt merely had to think himself back into his own boyhood, and the puerile conversation immediately seemed the most natural in the world. Edgar, for his part, had by now quite accepted the elder man as a chum, and very soon lost any sense of inferiority. All he was aware of was that he had found a friend—and what a friend! His relatives and friends in Vienna were forgotten, his pals with their squeaky voices, their idiotic chatter, might never have existed! They were submerged beneath this new and unprecedented experience. He had become an intimate of the stranger, his wonderful friend; and he swelled with pride when at parting, he was invited to a further ramble on the morrow. They separated as brothers and this farewell was, perhaps, the most glorious of Edgar’s life. Children are so easily hoaxed....

Baron Otto von Sternfeldt grinned as Edgar ran off. An intermediary had been found. The boy would doubtless regale his mother to satiety with every word, every gesture of this amazing encounter. The woman-hunter preened himself upon the subtle compliments he had conveyed through the son to the mother. He had invariably spoken of her as “Your lovely mother”—Edgar would do what was necessary; he, the baron, need make no further advances. The charming unknown would come to him. Not requisite to lift a finger. The baron could muse over the landscape from morning to night, from night till morning...A child’s warm hands, he knew, were building a bridge between his heart and the heart of the woman he coveted.

TRIO

As was clearly demonstrated a few hours later, the baron’s plan proved highly successful. Intentionally he came rather late to luncheon;and the boy, who was already seated at table, sprang up to greet his new friend with enthusiasm. He plucked his mother’s sleeve, whispered a few words in her ear, and drew her attention to the baron with hands and eyes. The lady reproved him for his unseemly behaviour, blushing the while and evidently put out of countenance. Yet she could not help glancing in the young gentleman’s direction, and this gave her suitor an opportunity. He bowed respectfully—henceforward they “knew” one another, the necessary introduction had been made. She, in her turn, felt obliged to recognize his civility with a gracious nod, but for the remainder of the meal she kept her eyes glued to her plate. With Edgar it was otherwise. He was constantly spying in the baron’s direction, and once even went so far as to address his newly-found friend—for which piece of effrontery his mother reproved him smartly. So soon as luncheon was over, he was ordered to go upstairs and lie down. Edgar begged and prayed to be let off. In the end his mother permitted him to take leave of the baron. The latter spoke a few pleasant words to the lad, and Edgar’s eyes glistened with joy. Then, with a nonchalant air, the young man stood up, turned towards the neighbouring table, and, addressing the lady, complimented her upon having so intelligent and jolly a little chap as son, and referred to the pleasant morning he and Edgar had passed in one another’s company. Meanwhile the boy stood by, blushing with delight. The baron plied the lady with questions concerning Edgar’s health, so that in the end she was compelled to reply. Gradually, as the barriers were broken down, the two elders engaged in a lengthy conversation to which the boy listened entranced. Then Sternfeldt introduced himself formally, mentioning his name and title—to which, it would seem, the lady was not wholly indifferent. Take it all in all, she was most gracious in her manner towards her new acquaintance. Nevertheless, she soon moved to withdraw, excusing herself from further conversation because of her son’s delicate health.

The boy entered a lively protest, saying that he was not in the least tired, and was quite prepared to sit up throughout the afternoon and far into the night. But his mother had already proffered her hand to the baron who deferentially bent his head over it and kissed it gallantly.

That night Edgar slept badly. His brain was in a whirl of ecstasy and despair. Something new had suddenly entered his life. For the first time in his experience he had participated in the destinies of fully grown persons. As he swayed between sleep and waking he forgot his own childhood and deemed himself an adult. So far, his existence had not been a particularly happy one, since he was an only child and his health was constantly giving trouble. His parents had been the only target for his affections, and they paid little heed to him. The boy’s other companions were the household servants. Thus his feelings had been pent up to bursting point, and at the first chance were likely to overwhelm the object which seemed worthy of a great love. Edgar lay in the dark, happy but puzzled, wishing to laugh aloud and finding the tears streaming down his face. He loved his new friend more deeply than father, mother, or even God Almighty. An intense and passionate longing went up from his heart, and wove a glamour around the image of this fascinating companion.

“I’m certainly not worthy of his friendship,” he thought. “A kid like me, barely twelve, all my schooldays before me, sent off to bed long before anyone else thinks of going...What can I ever be to him? What have I to offer him?...”

This torturing sense of inability to show his friend what he felt made Edgar miserable. Before, when he had chummed up with a schoolfellow, he had always been able to show his liking by the gift of a stamp from his album, or some other object dear to a youthful heart. But now things of the sort seemed idiotic, utterly valueless. How could he present such paltry tokens of affections to his new friend? What means could he employ to show his regard? He was tormented by the recognition of his immaturity. How rotten to be nothing more than a kid of twelve! Never had he so yearned to be grown up, to be big and strong, to be a real man.

These uneasy musings were interwoven with premonitions of an awakening manhood, rosy dreams which passed gradually into the realm of sleep. But even as he slept, a contented smile played about his lips....Tomorrow he would see his friend again....Had they not fixed it up for a walk together?...

At seven he awoke with a start. Had he overslept himself? Quickly he got into his clothes, and ran to bid his mother the customary good morning. She was amazed to find him up so early. Usually it was all she could do to drag him out of his bed and get him washed and dressed in time for breakfast.

Before she could question him as to his unwonted behaviour, he had already bolted from the room. Forgetting all about breakfast, Edgar prowled up and down the lounge till nine eagerly watching the lift, determined not to miss his friend and the promised walk....

At last, a little before ten, Baron Otto von Sternfeldt strolled unconcernedly into the hall. The tryst had long since escaped his memory. But when the boy rushed up to him and passionately recalled the previous day’s promise, the baron proved affable, and cordially entered into Edgar’s plan, smiling the while at so excessive a demonstration of friendliness. Linking his arm in that of his companion, he sauntered to and fro, quietly but firmly refusing to quit the hall immediately. He seemed to be waiting for someone, and scanned both lift and doors attentively. Of a sudden he stiffened. Edgar’s mother sailed towards the twain with a smile of greeting. She fell in with the idea of a walk, and the three set out together.

This was far from being the treat Edgar had expected. He had reckoned upon a tete-a-tete, and was sorely disappointed. Biting his lips, the boy slouched sulkily in their wake. The promised walk, he thought, was his own special privilege. It had only been out of kindness that he had introduced his mother to this wonderful friend, but he could not conceive why he should share the baron’s friendship with anyone. A dash of jealousy intermingled with his loving adoration. He could not help noticing how attentive and considerate the man was towards this interloper....

As the trio made tracks for the woods, the talk was almost wholly directed towards Edgar. His frail health, his paleness, were commented upon by the woman with loving anxiety, while the baron insisted upon the sprightly wit and pleasant ways of his “Friend”, as it pleased him to call the lad. This created an idea of his own importance in Edgar’s mind, contributing to his sense of self-esteem—a dangerous feeling to arouse in a child’s heart. Thus flattered, he regained his good humour. Never before had people conceded him any rights. Now he felt he had been given his due. He was allowed to enter into the conversation on equal terms, instead of being told that little boys were to be seen but not heard. Moreover, he spoke of certain wishes he had long been forced to repress, and they were now given serious consideration. What was there to be surprised at that such treatment should make him feel grown up? Childhood with its artless dreams lay behind him, a relic of the past, discarded like a worn-out garment.

The lady invited Sternfeldt to share her table at luncheon. A casual acquaintanceship had ripened into friendship. Our trio was now in full swing, the voices of woman, man, and child mingling harmoniously together.

ATTACK

The hunter began to think that the time had come when he could bring his quarry to bay. A trio was not to his liking. Very pleasant as a temporary convenience doubtless, but it had served its turn and was not the object of his maneuvering. He knew that, as the saying runs, “Two’s company, three’s none”—that the presence of a third party makes it necessary for Eros to wear a mask, that, except in a duet, loving words lose their tang and the fire of an onslaught is chilled. Throughout their conversation she must never be allowed to forget what he was aiming at. He was sure she had already understood....

It did not seem to Otto at all improbable that his preoccupation with the lady would be crowned with success. She had reached an age when a woman may well regret having remained faithful to a husband she has never loved, an age when her mature beauty craves for one last acknowledgment, when a choice has to be made between the antagonistic forces constituted by motherhood and womanhood.Life, whose riddles had long since appeared to be solved, in this fateful hour poses a fresh question, and the magnetic needle of the will hovers between the hope of a final love-experience and quiet resignation. A matron has then to decide whether she is to live for herself or for her children, whether she is to be the devoted mother or the beloved woman. The baron, who credited himself with a profound knowledge of feminine psychology, believed he had struck up acquaintance with the lady precisely at the perilous hour when she would be obliged to decide the issue as between pleasure and duty. He noticed that in their talks she rarely mentioned her husband, who plainly could satisfy no more than the most superficial of her needs. She had expected marriage to give her an outstanding position in the world, but it had failed to do so; and, worse than this, her husband had little interest in their boy. A shade of melancholy and boredom veiled her lustrous eyes, darkening her life and blunting the edges of her sensibilities.

The baron made up his mind to set about his business of conquest without further ado, but he realized that he must not betray undue haste. Like an angler playing a fish, he wished to land his catch and at the same time to postpone the moment of netting, so as to be sure that his prey did not escape him. He would assume indifference, entice her into making the first advances; whereas in reality it was he who wooed her favours. Taking advantage of his social position, he resolved to treat her somewhat arrogantly so that she would feel her inferiority. It tickled his fancy, this thought that the glamour of an aristocratic name, the gloss of distinguished manners, would enable him to overcome her scruples and to clasp her beautiful body in his embrace.

The game was becoming an exciting one, and called for discretion. Otto spent that afternoon in his own room, well aware that he would be missed and his presence looked for. Yet, truth to tell, this deliberate absence did not so much affect the lady, who hardly noticed it, as the boy, for whom it constituted a martyrdom. Edgar felt utterly lost, utterly at a loose end. With boyish obstinacy he waited, throughout the creeping, dreary hours, for a glimpse of his friend. To have sought other recreations would have seemed to him a betrayal. He haunted the passages and stairs, and, as evening approached, his heart was filled with anguish. He began to imagine that some misfortune had overtaken the baron, or that he had given unwitting offense to his big friend. Impatient and alarmed, the boy felt his eyes brimming over with scalding tears.

At dinner, Baron Otto von Sternfeldt received a warm welcome. Edgar sprang up to greet him, and, to the astonishment of the other guests and to the distress of his mother, flung his arms passionately round the baron’s neck, exclaiming:

“Oh, where have you been? We’ve been looking for you everywhere.”

Frau Blumental reddened with vexation at being dragged into the business in this tactless fashion. She called her son to order.

“Sois sage, Edgar. Assieds-toi!”

The child obeyed, but continued to ply his questions, so that his mother again reprimanded him.

“You must remember that Baron von Sternfeldt is his own master and can do as he likes. Perhaps he finds our society boring.”

Admirable, thought Otto, she had included herself in the company, so that the reproach to her child became an indirect compliment to himself.

Our huntsman was again on the alert. He was indeed in luck to have thus easily found the spoor! With bright eyes, with a flush which brought the bloom on to his cheeks, he now talked easily and wittily. Like all strongly erotic persons, his eloquence grew as he felt himself appreciated by the object of his desire. He had a gift for anecdote and sprightly repartee which, after a couple of glasses of the champagne he had ordered in honour of the occasion, outstripped even his own expectations. Big-game hunts in India with an English nobleman—here, forsooth, was a splendid subject to captivate the interest of a woman for whom such exotic experiences were unattainable. Nevertheless, it was the boy who was the most impressed by these personal experiences, and not the woman. He sat enthralled, forgetting to eat or drink, lapping up every word that dropped from Sternfeldt’s lips. Who could ever have hoped to meet in the flesh a hero of dangerous exploits, and to hear the account of adventures so enchanting? Tiger hunts, brownskinned natives, Juggernaut cars crushing thousands of human bodies beneath their weight—of these Edgar had read in books. But he had never believed that such things actually existed. They had seemed no more than fairy-tales. Now they were proved to be true. Edgar’s eyes could not leave his friend’s face, or, alternatively, those marvelous hands whose fingers had pressed the trigger and had killed tigers. The boy hardly ventured a question, and, when he did, his voice trembled with excitement. His lively imagination quickly called up a picture of the baron perched aloft upon an elephant’s back, sitting in a purple howdah, to right and left swarthy men wearing magnificent turbans;the tiger snarling and showing its teeth; the jungle; blood oozing from the elephant’s neck where the great cat clawed. Even more interesting narratives were in store, for Sternfeldt told of how old and well-trained elephants were used as decoys to entrap wild ones. Edgar’s eyes sparkled....

Then, shattering his magic world, came the voice of his mother, saying, as she glanced at her watch:

“Neuf heures? Au lit, Edgar!”

The boy went pale with alarm. Bedtime is for every child a bugaboo, for it implies a putting to shame, is a public demonstration that adults look upon a boy or a girl of tender years as an inferior, as a creature in need of more sleep than their Olympian selves. Doubly poignant was the disgrace of such an implication at so unique, so interesting a moment as that which Edgar was experiencing.

“Oh, Mother, do let me hear just one more story about the elephant who...”

He was ready to beg and pray for her leniency, when it dawned upon him that the role of suppliant little accorded with his new status as grown-up. Too late! His mother, brushing his request aside, said severely:

“Non, Edgar, il se fait tard. Monte. Sois sage. Je te raconterai toutes les histoires de Monsieur le Baron demain.”

The child hesitated. Usually his mother saw him into bed. Still, he was not going to demean himself by begging a favour in front of this stranger. Not he! So Edgar merely asked:

“Promise, Mother, you’ll tell me everything, you won’t forget? All about the elephants...”

“Yes, yes.”

“To-night, when you come up?”

“Yes. Now run along with you.”

How Edgar managed to bid them good night without breaking down, he did not know. His throat ached with suppressed tears. Sternfeldt pulled a comical face which brought a grin to the lad’s mouth, but he had to make quick tracks for the exit in order to conceal the sobs which could no longer be kept in check.

ELEPHANTS

Frau Blumental remained below in converse with the baron, but their talk was no longer about elephants and big-game hunting. After Edgar had vanished through the doorway, they were both troubled, embarrassed, and the conversation began to flag. Otto suggested they should transfer to the lounge. Here they found a quiet corner. The young man ordered more champagne; and, after they had sipped a glass or two, their oppression evaporated and the talk took a dangerous turn. Baron Otto von Sternfeldt was not handsome. His youthful appearance and manly bearing, his energetic, sunburned face, his short-cropped hair, and his sprightly manner were, however, undeniably in his favour;and these were the characteristics which exercised their spell upon the lady. She allowed her gaze to dwell upon this comely companion, and no longer feared to meet his eyes.

Gradually a certain boldness entered his speech, which ruffled her sense of security as if a hand had been laid upon her, palpating her body desirously, so that the blood raced up into her face and beat feverishly in her temples. Then she would be reassured as he flung back his head and gave vent to a boyish laugh, scattering to the winds as a childish joke any suggestion of sensuousness that might have lurked in his words. At times she thought it advisable to reprove him for, his delicate effrontery but, coquettish by nature, she rather enjoyed the implication, and eagerly looked forward to his next move. The game caught her,too, in its meshes; and in the end she was led to follow his lead. Her eyes spoke flattering promises, her lips uttered encouraging words. She even allowed him to sit closer beside her, and she felt his warm breath upon her naked shoulder. Like all those who engage upon a game, they become so engrossed that they forgot the passage of time, and it was not until the hall-clock struck midnight that the woman rose in alarm.

Then only did she realize how far the young man’s advances had gone. This was not the first time she had played with fire, but hitherto she had never permitted things to reach such a stage. With horror it was borne in upon her that she was no longer fully mistress of herself, that something intangible was slipping from her grasp, that her senses were in a whirl. Her brain reeled, what with the wine, the momentary shock of anxiety, the ardent talk....

“Good night,” she said hastily. “See you to-morrow.”

Already she was stretching forth her hand in farewell. He, however, was not inclined to let her get away so easily. He retained her hand in his with gentle mastery, and bent his lips to it ceremoniously. But the conventional act of politeness assumed ampler form as he kissed her slender finger-tips and followed up his advantage as far as her wrist. When his moustache brushed the back of her hand, she shivered slightly and a feeling of warmth invaded her being, anguishing and ravishing at one, and the same time. Again the tell-tale blood coursed swiftly, setting her pulses throbbing. Anxiety, senseless anxiety, deprived her of selfcommand and she wrenched her hand away from his grasp.

“Stay a little while longer,” Otto pleaded.

But she was already half-way to the door, walking clumsily with an excess of speed. He was more than satisfied at this display of ungainliness, for it was a sure and certain sign that the excitement he had wished to arouse was responsible for her inelegant movements. For her part, all she could think of was to get away as quickly as possible from this man who might pursue and catch her. Yet another personality within made her sorry that he did not follow....What for years she had hoped might one day happen might very well have taken place at that perilous moment: an adventure. How she loved the hazard that word implied. Often before she had been on the brink, but always she had pulled up in time. Yet she desired nothing better than to be swept off her feet by a great passion. A mere flirtation seemed to her a paltry experience.

But Sternfeldt was too proud to seize the first favorable opportunity. He knew that his victory was secured, so why take advantage of a momentary weakness when a woman’s mind was confused by liquor to make a piratical onslaught and secure the prize? No, he must play fair; she should come to him of her own accord and when in full possession of her faculties. She could not escape him now, for the sweet intoxication had entered her soul.

As she got out of the lift, she pressed her hand upon her heart to stay its furious beating. She breathed a sigh that was partly one of relief at eluding a danger and partly one of regret that danger had not overtaken her. She felt dazed. With eyes downcast, swaying slightly like a drunken person, she groped her way along the passage to her room. Another sigh of relief as she felt the cold door-handle and turned it....Safe at last!

With stealthy tread she entered, and softly closed the door so as not to disturb the child. Then she shrank back in terror. What was that, stirring over there in the darkness? She twitched all over in alarm, was about to cry for help, when a sleep-weary voice asked:

“Is that you, Mummy?”

“What on earth are you up to there?” she cried, witching on the light and running towards the sofa.

Edgar lay huddled up among the cushions, but as she advanced he sat up drowsily. Her first thought was that her child was ill, and had crept into her room for aid. But Edgar said sleepily with a note of reproach in his voice:

“I waited and waited for you to come, and then I went to sleep.”

“What did you want?”

“To hear about the elephants.”

“Elephants? What elephants?”

But even as she spoke she remembered her promise. Poor innocent, he had slipped into her room so confident that she would be true to her word and tell him about the baron’s exploits, but she had failed him,and he had fallen asleep....No, this was absurd, after all; extravagantly foolish. She was outraged. Yet at bottom she was angry with herself, feeling ashamed and guilty.

“Go to your bed at once, you young scallawag,” she cried fiercely.

Edgar looked at her in amazement. What had he done to put her into such a tantrum? The child’s bewilderment only served to infuriate her the more.

“I told you to go to your own room. Go, at once,” she said savagely, feeling all the while how unjust she was.

Without a word, Edgar slunk away. He was desperately tired and only dimly realized that his mother had broken her promise and for some unaccountable reason was angry with him. The mists of sleep encompassed his mind, and he was in no state to rebel. Every sensation was blunted by fatigue, yet he was alert enough to blame himself for having fallen asleep when it was so important to keep awake, “like a silly kid,” he told himself reproachfully, as he drifted off into the Land of Nod. Since yesterday morning his childhood had become detestable to him.

SKIRMISHING

It was Sternfeldt’s turn to sleep badly that night. An interrupted love-adventure is not favourable to repose. A restless, dream-laden night made him regret not having seized the propitious moment...The shades of sleeplessness and discontent still shrouded his mind when, next morning, he came down on his way to breakfast. The boy, who for some time had been lying in ambush, made a passionate assault, flung his lean arms round his friend, and volleyed forth questions. How jolly to have this big friend all to himself and not have to share his treasure with Mother! She did not need to tell him the wonderful stories, she had broken faith; the hero himself would give an account of those enthralling adventures.

The baron was put out. He found the child’s constant spying most incommodious. The deluge of questions was intolerable. The passionate love bestowed on him by the boy was becoming a burden.It was a nuisance to have a twelve-year-old jackanapes perpetually at one’s heels. What he wanted was to get hold of the mother before she had cooled off. How could this aim be realized if the child was always hanging around? Uneasiness germinated in his mind. Had he done wisely to arouse Edgar’s tender emotions? Certainly it was going to prove difficult to free himself from this ubiquitous youth!

Still, it was up to him to try. He was expecting Frau Blumental to appear at about ten o’clock, and meanwhile he allowed the boy to besiege him with questions. They flowed over him like an avalanche, and he needed merely to put in a word here and there to keep the child happy. When the minute-hand was at the hour he made as if he suddenly recollected an appointment, and begged Edgar to run over to the opposite hotel to ask whether Count Grundheim, the baron’s cousin, had arrived.

Radiant that the message should be confided to his care Edgar sped off to inquire. How splendid to be of use to his friend! Eager to carry out his mission worthily, the boy bustled along—to the inconvenience and surprise of other visitors. He was keen on showing how smart a messenger he could be, and took no notice of their exasperated stares. The porter informed him that Count Grundheim had not yet arrived, and that, indeed, the gentleman’s coming had not, so far, ever been announced. Edgar returned on winged feet, bringing the tidings—but the lounge was empty, the baron was nowhere to be found. No answer came to a knock at his friend’s door. Dashing from hall to diningroom, from music-room to bar, he inquired from all and sundry whether they had seen Baron von Sternfeldt. Then he ran helter-skelter to his mother’s quarters—but she, too, had vanished. Coming downstairs once more, he asked the porter, who told him that the pair had gone out together a few minutes earlier. The child was dumbfounded.

Edgar awaited their return with all the patience he could muster. In his innocence, he suspected nothing untoward. They’d only be gone a very short while he was sure, for the baron would want to know whether Count Grundheim had come or not. Hour followed hour, and, as they did not return, the boy grew increasingly uneasy. Ever since the morning when his seductive stranger had entered his young life, he had been in suspense. The child mind is a fragile mechanism, and every passion leaves its imprint like a seal upon wax. Edgar’s eyelids began to quiver, his face became wan. He waited and waited; at first patiently, but anon becoming more and more excited, until at last he burst into tears. Even now his suspicions were not aroused. He possessed so blind a confidence in his new friend that he attributed everything to a misunderstanding. A doubt entered his mind. Might he not have interpreted the message falsely?

At last they came back, and stood talking pleasantly in the hall just as if nothing unusual had happened. They did not seem to have missed him. Without asking for the answer to his message, the baron said:

“We thought we’d meet you on the way, Eddie.”

Overcome with confusion at the thought that they had looked for him vainly, the child protested that he had run straight back along High Street. What direction had they taken? But Frau Blumental cut her son’s indiscreet questions short, saying:

“There, there now! Children must not try to put their fingers into every pie.”

Edgar went scarlet with mortification. It was the second time she had humiliated him in the presence of his friend. Why did she do this? What was the object’ of making him out to be the child he no longer felt himself to be? She must envy him so wonderful a friend and had probably planned to capture the baron for herself. How mean! Yes;and it was she, doubtless, who had deliberately led Sternfeldt in the wrong direction. But he was not going to let her misuse him whenever the fancy seized her. He’d show her! He made up his mind not to say a word to her during luncheon but only to address his friend.

This plan was difficult of execution. What he most feared happened: neither of them noticed his fit of the sulks. Worse still, they seemed to be unaware of his presence, though yesterday he had been the focus around which had concentrated their attention and interest. They talked over his head, joked and laughed as if he were non-existent. The blood welled up into his cheeks, he felt a lump in his throat which nearly suffocated him. Keenly aware of his impotence to create a more favourable atmosphere around his person, he sat mumchance while his mother stole his only friend away under his nose. He would have given almost anything to have the courage to stand up and thump the table with his fist—just to make them realize that he was there. But he did not dare to assert himself. He had to be content with laying down his knife and fork, and refusing to eat. In this demonstration, too, he was foiled for they were not aware of his self-imposed fast until the final course was being served. Then his mother inquired if he was not feeling well.“Ugh,” he thought, “She’s always fussing about my health. Otherwise she doesn’t care a scrap.” His answer was curt. “Not hungry,” was all he said—and she appeared satisfied. Still they continued to ignore him. The baron seemed totally to have forgotten his existence. Anyway, he never addressed a single word to the boy. Edgar’s eyes burned with partially suppressed tears, and he was forced to adopt the childish subterfuge of wiping his mouth in order to mop up with his table—napkin the water which coursed down his face. At last the meal was over; and, with a sigh of relief, he pushed back his chair, prepared to rush away from the table.

While they had been eating, his mother had proposed an excursion to Maria-Schutz. “So she’s determined not to leave me a minute alone with the baron,” thought the child. But worse was in store. As Edgar was making for the door, his mother called him back, saying:

“Edgar, you’ll be forgetting all you ever learned if you don’t set to work on your holiday tasks. You had better stay quietly at home, and get on with your schoolwork for an hour or so.”

Why was she set upon humiliating him before his friend, perpetually recalling him to the fact that he was a child? Edgar clenched his fists and turning on his heel, again made for the exit.

“Huffy? You take offence too easily, my son,” she said, smiling indulgently. Then, addressing the baron she added: “Do you find me too severe when I ask him to attend to his studies for an hour now and again?”

The baron’s reply was like an icy morsel of steel plunged into Edgar’s heart.

“Can’t for the life of me see what harm a few hours’ study could do.”

Was it a plot to get rid of him? Were they leagued against him? Edgar’s gorge rose.

“Dad said I wasn’t to do any lessons while I was here,” he declared. “Dad said I was to get well and strong.”

The child’s threatening aspect—or was it the reference to paternal authority?—seemed to produce an effect upon his antagonists. His mother drummed with her fingers on the table, and stared out through the window. An oppressive silence weighed upon the trio. After a prolonged pause, the baron said with a forced smile:

“Just as you please, Eddie. It’s not for me to preach; I was as lazy as you make ’em at your age, and failed in all my exams.”

But Edgar was long past being in a mood to respond to such pleasantries. He looked up at Sternfeldt with searching eyes, as though he would fain have penetrated to his friend’s innermost thoughts. What was happening? Something had changed. They were no longer the intimates they had been. Why! The child was too young to unravel the mystery. He lowered his eyes while his heart beat like a sledge-hammer. Doubt had entered his mind.

However, the mother relented, and said:

“All right, Edgar, lie down for half an hour. Then get ready to start. You shall come with us on the drive.”

THE BURNING SECRET

“How account for the change?” mused Edgar, as the three of them rolled along in a hired landau. “Why are they no longer the same to me as they were? Mother avoids my eves. I wonder why. Why is the baron always up to some foolery as if he wanted to amuse me? But I don’t want to be amused, I want him to treat me as he did man to man. They both seem to have got quite other faces. They don’t speak to me as they did yesterday and the day before. Mother’s lips are so red she must have painted them. She’s never done that. And he’s always frowning as though he were put out. But I can’t remember saying a single word that could have been taken amiss. Can’t think of any reason why...Besides, they’re not behaving to one another in the old way. One could think they were up to some game they were ashamed of. They’re hiding something. I feel sure. They’re not talking naturally as they did, they don’t laugh any more. There’s a secret they don’t want me to know about. I must, at any cost, find out what this secret is. Perhaps I know what it is already. It must be the one people are always trying to hide from me; the same as is hidden in books they forbid me to read, the same as when we go to the opera and a man and a woman hold out their arms to one another, hug one another. Then there was that French governess who did not hit it off with Dad and was given notice and sent away. All these things seem to hang together; but why, I wonder? Oh, if I could only know, just get hold of the key to the secret. Then I should no longer be a child, and have interesting things hidden from me. It’s a case of now or never. I’m going to snatch their secret from them....”

His brow puckered, giving his juvenile visage a quaintly old appearance. The beautiful landscape might just as well not have existed so far as he was concerned, for his whole mental energy was absorbed in trying to unravel the enigma. And yet the scene was an enchanting one. Mountains encircled with a ring of emerald trees, tender with their early spring foliage; valleys filled with wisps of iridescent mists dappled with golden sunshine. Edgar could only see his two companions opposite him, lolling on the comfortable seat of the carriage. He glared at them as though by the very force of his concentrated stare he could extract the secret from their eyes and hearts. Nothing is guaranteed to sharpen the intelligence quicker than a passion-laden suspicion; nothing is better calculated to ripen the infantile mind prematurely than the feeling that one is on the right scent without knowing what one is hunting. Children are often separated from what adults call “The real world” by a tenuous partition which a zephyr may blow down.

Edgar was convinced that he was nearer elucidating the mystery than he had ever been before; the solution seemed to be just under his hand. He was excited at the approach of discovery, and the solemnity of the occasion made him grave beyond his years. In his unconscious, he was aware that he had reached the frontiers of his childhood.

The couple ensconced in the back seat sensed opposition in the air without realizing that it emanated from Edgar. The roomy vehicle had suddenly grown too small for the three passengers. The intense scrutiny of the boy’s dark eyes made the two elders uncomfortable. They hardly ventured to utter a word, to exchange a glance. They could not get back to the gossamer-light tone of their previous discourse. No matter what topic they started, the conversation soon flagged.

The woman was more sensitive to the child’s mutism than Baron von Sternfeldt. She was alarmed at Edgar’s morose expression and started back in disgust when she detected upon the callow visage of her son the self-same grimace as that which her husband made when he was put out. Never before had Edgar shown any resemblance to his father. Particularly at such a moment as this was she loathed to be reminded of her husband. The child sitting there huddled upon the tiny seat seemed like a ghost, a reproachful guardian of her ways. She felt conscience-stricken. Suddenly Edgar glanced up, and looked her full in the eyes. Mother and son instantaneously lowered their lids. For the first time in their life together they were watching one another. This they both realized with anguish squeezing their hearts. Up till now they had blindly trusted each other; now a hedge of doubt and suspicion rose up between them. A latent hatred invaded them, a sensation so novel that neither admitted as yet that it existed.

All three were genuinely relieved when the horses drew up in front of the hotel. The drive had been wretched from start to finish, but none of them was frank enough to say so. Edgar was the first to jump out of the landau. Frau Blumental, saying she had a headache, made straight for her room. The boy and Otto were thus left alone. After paying the driver, Baron von Sternfeldt strode off towards the lounge, passing close to Edgar without so much as noticing the child’s presence. He had forgotten his little friend’s existence, and left the poor lad behind as if such an insignificant creature was of no more concern to him any more than the coachman on the box or the horses harnessed to the carriage.

Something broke inside Edgar’s head as that beloved and slender figure receded. Despair filled his heart at the thought that this wonderful friend had brushed past without a glance or a word. What could he have done to cause displeasure? The mantle of his newly acquired dignity slipped from his frail shoulders; he was no more than a small and helpless boy, as childlike and immature as he had been yesterday and during all the years that went before. With hesitating footsteps, his legs quailing beneath him, he followed in the baron’s wake, caught up the older man who was about to engage in the revolving door, and stuttered:

“What have I done? Please tell me. Why don’t you look at me any more? And Mother, too? Why are you and she always trying to get rid of me now? Am I a nuisance? Have I been naughty?”

Otto was alarmed at the tone of the child’s voice; it troubled him strangely, and he felt moved.

“Eddie, you silly old fool, don’t worry. I’m out of temper to-day, that’s all. You’ve not done anything. You’re a jolly little fellow, and I’m very fond of you.”

He rumpled the boy’s hair affectionately, but at the same time he averted his head so as not to look into those huge, imploring eyes which were now brimming over with tears. The game he was playing seemed to him paltry and unworthy. He was ashamed of having wrought havoc with a child’s innocent adoration. That was a mean thing to have done.

“Run along now, Eddie. We’ll meet again this evening on the old terms, and this misunderstanding will be forgotten.”

“And you won’t allow Mother to send me to bed so early, will you? Promise.”

“No, Eddie, trust me. But you’d better be getting to your room now. The dinner gong will be sounding soon, and we shan’t have washed and changed.”

For the time being, Edgar was comforted. He felt quite happy as he went upstairs. But soon his heart misgave him. He had grown years older since yesterday, and an unknown guest had taken up quarters in his mind: mistrust.

He waited. This was to be the ultimate test. The three of them sat together at the little dining-table. Nine o’clock struck, but Mother did not send him to bed. He became uneasy. Why to-day in particular was she allowing him to sit up beyond his wonted hour? Had the baron betrayed him? Bitterly did he now repent having run after his sometime friend and put in so urgent a plea. At ten his mother got up, and took leave of the baron. Strange, but the man, too, seemed in nowise taken aback by her breaking up the party thus early, and made no endeavour to keep her as he had done before. The child’s heart beat to suffocation.

Now for the test, thought Edgar. He made as if he had noticed nothing, and docilely followed his mother to the door. Arrived there, he suddenly raised his eyes and caught his mother in the act. She was smiling at the baron, an enigmatical smile, a smile of mutual understanding. So this was the explanation of her early withdrawal from the dining-room. The baron had cheated him. He was to be cajoled into obedience so that they might enjoy one another’s company unmolested.

“Cad,” muttered Edgar.

“What was that you said?” inquired his mother.

“Nothing,” he replied, between clenched teeth.

He too held a secret within his heart. Its name? Hatred, unbounded hatred for the two of them.

SILENCE

Edgar henceforward felt easy. His heart was overflowing with one undivided emotion: hatred, open enmity. He was now absolutely single-minded. Since he knew that his presence was irksome, he took a voluptuous pleasure in sticking to them like a leech. His energies were concentrated upon making their lives a burden to them. The baron was the first to feel the boy’s fangs.

Next morning, when Sternfeldt passed through the lounge throwing a friendly “Good morning, Eddie” to the child, the latter did not look up but muttered a cold, hard “Good morning” in return.

“Mother down yet?”

Edgar remained buried in the newspaper. “Don’t know,” he said carelessly.

The baron was surprised. What could this mean?

“Slept badly, Eddie?” he asked, facetiously.

“No,” answered the boy curtly, and buried his head still deeper in the periodical.

“Silly young ass,” murmured Otto, shrugging, and passing on his way.

War had been declared.

Towards his mother Edgar behaved with exaggerated politeness. A suggestion that it would be good for his health to play a game of tennis was courteously thrust aside. A fixed and rather bitter smile showed that he was no longer to be duped by such ruses. With assumed friendliness he remarked: “I’d rather go for a walk with you and Baron von Sternfeldt, Mummy.”

He glanced up at her as he spoke, and noticed her embarrassment. At length she said:

“Wait for me here,” and passed into the dining-room where breakfast was served for her.

He waited; but as he waited mistrust grew stronger within him. At last he decided to go outside where he could keep the front door under observation and all the other exits likewise. His instinct told him his enemies were likely to betray him again, and he was determined not to be caught napping. Books on Red Indians had taught him how to take cover, and he crept behind a wood-pile. He chuckled contentedly when, half an hour later his mother came stealthily out of one of the side with a superb bunch of red roses in her hand, and, close at her heels, the baron, the traitor.

Both appeared to be in fine fettle, to be enjoying the fact that they had given Edgar the slip, and could now relish their secret together, without the boy’s watchful eye perpetually upon them.

The moment had come for the young spy to act. He sauntered along the path towards the hotel as if he had not observed them, pretending he was engrossed in the bushes and birds, giving them ample time to compose their features after their initial surprise. Very deliberately the child drew nearer, and, when a few yards away, lifted mocking eyes towards them. Frau Blumental was the first to recover.

“Ah, there you are at last, Edgar. We’ve been hunting for you all over the place.”

“What a whopper,” thought the boy, as the lie slid easily off her tongue. But he kept himself in hand, and drew a veil over the intensity of his hate. They stood in a bunch, not knowing what to do next, each watching the other.

“Well, we’d better be starting,” said the woman, nervously plucking the head off one of the beautiful roses. Her sensitive nostrils quivered, and Edgar knew this was a sign that she was angry. The boy did not move. He continued to gaze indifferently aloft, into the blue firmament. At length they passed onward down the path, and he followed. One more endeavour on the baron’s part.

“There’s a tennis tournament this afternoon, Eddie. Don’t you want to be there?”

The boy looked at his interlocutor with unconcealed disgust, and did not deign to answer. He pursed up his lips as if about to whistle.

His presence weighed upon the two elders. They walked like convicts under guard. The child said nothing and did nothing, and yet his presence became more and more irksome as the minutes went by. He repelled their advances, their essays at conciliation. His eyelids stung with suppressed tears, his lips were drawn and sullen. Suddenly, feeling she could bear this furtive observation no longer, the mother ordered Edgar to go on in front.

“I can’t stand your dogging my steps like this. It makes me nervous.”

Obediently, the boy took the lead, but every once in a while he looked back to see if they were following, and would wait for them to catch up with him if they dawdled on the way.

His obstinate silence poisoned any pleasure they had hoped to derive from this stroll, and his hostile eyes dried up the words on their lips. Baron Otto von Sternfeldt did not venture to woo, and it was with impotent fury that he sensed the woman slipping from his grasp as the passion he had been at such pains to evoke cooled under the observation of this nerve-racking and detestable child. Every time they started to converse they became tongue-tied. In the end, the trio wandered aimlessly through the forest, wrapped in a shroud of silence, while the trees rustled above their heads and the sound of their own footsteps beat upon the air. The boy had successfully wet-blanketed their conversation.

A malevolent spirit had taken up its abode in the heart of each one of them. But the child was armed and invulnerable; he took a wild delight in the fact that he, whom they despised, remained unscathed by their wrath. It was sheer delight to see how mortified the baron was, how he resented such treatment. Edgar could guess the tenor of the curses that lay unuttered upon the man’s lips; he knew that his mother’s temper rising; he realized that they would have given almost anything to fall upon him tooth and nail, to get rid of him by hook or by crook. But he gave them no occasion to treat him harshly, behaving civilly, walking sedately before them. His hatred had reckoned upon hours of this martyrdom, and he was determined not to yield an iota of his advantage.

“let’s go back,” said Frau Blumental at last, exasperated, feeling she would have to scream if the tension continued.

“What a pity,” rejoined her son placidly, “It’s such a lovely afternoon.”

Both the elders noted that the lad was making fun of them. But neither dared a rebuke, for the youngster’s outward conduct was exemplary. In two days he had acquired a self-mastery beyond his years. Not a sign could be read upon that tender face...Without further discussion the trio made their way home. Alone in their suite, mother and son let fall the mask of reserve. She threw down her sunshade and gloves in a pet, thus revealing to Edgar’s watchful eyes that her nerves were on edge and that her emotions craved an outlet. Nothing better, thought the boy, than that she should give way to her exasperation. In order to provoke her he remained fidgeting about in her room. She walked feverishly to and fro, sat down, drummed with her fingers on the table, sprang to her feet again.

“How untidy your hair is,” she scolded. “Your hands are grubbywash them at once. It’s disgusting to go about in such a state. A boy of your age, too; aren’t you ashamed?”

Edgar grinned as he betook himself to the bathroom. “She can’t stand my being with her,” he reflected maliciously.

He knew now that they were frightened of him and his relentless eyes, that they dreaded the moment when the three of them were forced to share one another’s company. Proportionally as they grew uneasy, the boy grew happy and content. They were defenceless against the child’s tactics. Sternfeldt, still hoping to gain his end, was furious,and determined to pay the boy back at the first suitable opportunity. Frau Blumental was fast losing control. It was a relief to her feelings to rebuke Edgar and find fault at every turn. “Don’t fidget with your spoon,” she would say at table. “Where are your manners? You are not fit to take your meals among grown-ups.”

The boy grinned, and continued to grin with his head a little to one side. He knew well enough what lay behind such reproofs, and was proud at having provoked them. His expression was as calm and collected as that of a doctor by a patient’s bedside. Hate is an excellent master for teaching the young self-discipline. A day or two ago Edgar would have made scenes under such trying circumstances. Now he kept silent and always silent, until they both squirmed under his silence.

The meal over, Frau Blumental got up, and Edgar prepared to follow her in the most natural way in the world. She turned on him with the irritation of a horse pestered with flies, and said vehemently:

“Why do you cling to me in this silly fashion as if you were a baby of three? I don’t want you constantly hanging around, d’you hear? Children should not always be with their elders. Go and amuse yourself on your own for a bit. Read, or do anything else you have a fancy for, but for heaven’s sake leave me in peace. I’m fed up with you and your stupid, tiresome ways.”

So he had got her to speak frankly at last! Edgar continued to grin, whereas the baron and she seemed at a loss. The woman turned her back, furious with herself for having given the show away to the child, while Edgar said complacently:

“Dad does not wish me to wander about here alone. Dad made me promise to be careful and to stick by you.”

The word “Dad” seemed to exercise a paralysing effect upon the couple, and Edgar, therefore, took a fresh delight in stressing it. His father, he felt, must also have a place in this burning secret, must wield power over the twain from a distance, otherwise why should they look so distressed at the mere mention of his name. Without deigning to answer, the woman led the way from the dining-room. The baron followed. The boy brought up the rear, not humbly as an inferior, but with the air of a warder, hard, severe, ruthless. In fancy he held them on a chain whose links he could hear rattling and which was indestructible. Hate had steeled his childish strength. He, the innocent, was more invulnerable than they who were under the ban of their secret.

THE LIARS

Time pressed. No more than a few days remained of the baron’s holiday, and these he wished to use to the full. Open conflict with an obstinate and determined child was unthinkable. The only way out of their dilemma was through flight. An ignominious surrender, undoubtedly, but what other alternative could be found if they were to escape for a couple of hours from the boy’s tyrannical observation?

“Just run along to the post and get this letter registered there’s a dear,” said Frau Blumental affably to her son.

They were standing inside, while the baron was with-out, engaging the services of a cabby.

Edgar took the missive gingerly. His heart misgave him. Could this be another trap? Usually his mother sent the porter on such errands. He hesitated and then asked:

“You’ll wait for me, won’t you? Where shall I find you?”

“Here.”

“Honour bright?”

“Of course.”

“Promise not to start without me.”

This smacked rather of command than of supplication. Fancy his ordering his mother about! Their relationship had certainly altered considerably since the day before yesterday. He scampered off with the letter and collided with Otto as the latter was entering the hotel through the revolving door. For the first time since their estrangement the boy took the initiative and addressed the baron:

“I’m just going to the post. Back in half a tick. Mummy’s waiting for me. Please don’t start before I get back.”

“Naturally we shan’t,” murmured Sternfeldt, squeezing by.

Edgar made for the post office. Here he was held up by having to wait in line for a considerable time. Then the gentleman in front had a dozen or more questions to ask. At last came his turn. He did his business with the utmost dispatch and rushed back to the hotel, the receipt fluttering between his fingers. Just as he arrived, panting, within sight of the front door, he saw his mother and the baron driving off in the cab.

Anger arrested his headlong progress. He felt like throwing stones after the retreating pair. They had eluded his vigilance. How mean! What a beastly lie! He knew that his mother fibbed occasionally. But that she should break her pledged word—that was too much. His trust in her was shattered. Life had become an enigma. Words and promises were no better than soap bubbles; the merest prick annihilated them. The secret must be a terrible one, Edgar thought, if it made two grownups break faith with a child, if it made them lie, steal away as though they were criminals. The books he had read had told him of people who had cheated in order to gain wealth or power or a throne. But what could these two be after? Why did they try to elude him? What were they endeavouring to hide behind this veil of lies? Cudgel his brains as he might, Edgar could discover no solution. And yet he felt dimly that if he could answer the riddle he would find the “Open sesame” out of the realm of childhood and would enter the kingdom of an adult man. His fury at their behaviour made it impossible for him to think clearly, otherwise....

The forest, the dark and silent forest, would furnish an answer to his perplexities. He sought refuge in its cool shade, gave free vent to his sorrow, allowed the tears he had so far restrained to flow.

“liars. Rotters. Traitors. Cads.”

He felt that if he did not let go he would suffocate.

All the anger, the impatience, the inquisitiveness, the helplessness, the treason of the last few days burst through the dam of his childish controls and found relief in tears. But this fit of unrestrained weeping closed the door forever upon his childhood. The flood carried away all the trust, the love, the reliance, and the respect which had so far been the essential constituents of his life.

The boy who later re-entered the hotel was a changed being. He was collected and purposeful. First of all he sought his own room, and washed the traces of tears from eyes and cheeks. Then he made ready for a settlement of accounts as between himself and his two foes. This satisfactorily arranged, he was prepared to wait patiently for their return.

The lounge was full of guests when the culprits alighted from the cab. Two gentlemen were playing chess. A little coterie of ladies were chatting. Various other individuals were reading papers and periodicals. The child, alert, a trifle pale, had taken an armchair among these grownups. His mother and the baron were annoyed at meeting him so soon, and were about to proffer their excuses when Edgar cut them short with:

“Sir, I should like a few words with you.”

The baron was nonplussed. He felt as though he had fallen into a trap.

“Yes, yes,” he said, flustered. “later, a little later.”

But Edgar protested in a high-pitched voice, so that everyone could hear:

“No, I want to have a talk with you now. You’ve behaved like a cad. You told me a lie. You knew very well that my mother had promised to wait for me till I got back from the post. But...”

“Edgar,” cried his mother, rushing towards him.

All eyes were now concentrated upon the trio, and the child, feeling that his hour had come continued:

“I say it again so that everyone may hear. You lied, both of you—and that’s a mean thing, a caddish thing to do.”

Baron Otto von Sternfeldt went white under the barrage of eyes. Frau Blumental seized her son by the arm, saying hoarsely:

“Come, come up to your room at once or I’ll spank you in front of all these people....”

Edgar had by now quieted down. A pity, he thought, that his excitement had got the better of him. He felt annoyed with himself, for he had intended to keep more than usually calm while challenging the baron, whereas in actual fact his anger had overmastered him. Avoiding any display of haste, he now turned towards the lift in order to seek his own quarters. His mother, embarrassed by the scrutiny of so many quizzical eyes was stammering:

“Please excuse his execrable behaviour...I’m awfully sorry...After all, he is no more than a child....”

She detested scandal or even the lightest breath of gossip associated with her name, and she knew that the situation needed the utmost tact if she was to come out of it unscathed. To save her face, she was careful not to beat a hasty retreat, but inquired whether there were any letters for her. Then, calmly and deliberately, she made her way to the lift and went to her room. Nevertheless, she was aware of the fact that her withdrawal was accompanied by giggles and malicious whispers.

A serious situation invariably took her unawares and made her anxious. She recognized that in the circumstances she had been remiss, and she dreaded a confrontation with her child. So she loitered on the way. Edgar had donned a new visage since yesterday, a visage which paralysed her. Fear counselled her to have recourse to gentleness when dealing with her son. She realized that, if the issue was forced into the open, Edgar would prove the stronger....

Opening the door quietly, she found the boy sitting in her room. There was no sign of fear in the eyes he raised to the encounter; there was not even inquisitiveness. He appeared to be absolutely sure of himself. Assuming her most motherly manner, she asked:

“Edgar, what could you have been thinking of? You made me blush. A child has no business to behave so outrageously to a grown-up person. You’ll have to ask the baron’s pardon....”

“No,” he answered indifferently, gazing at the trees outside.

This involved her in a quandary. Nevertheless, she continued valiantly:

“What’s up, Edgar? You are so changed I hardly recognize you. You have always been such a sensible and well-mannered boy that it was a pleasure to be with you. And now, all of a sudden, you behave as if you were possessed of the devil. What’s your grievance against Baron von Sternfeldt? You seemed very fond of him, and he has been so kind to you....”

“Yes; but that was merely to get to know you.”

“Nonsense,” she said, much perturbed. “What maggot’s got hold of you?”

“He’s a liar and a cad. Everything he does is calculated beforehand. He is a vulgar beast. He wanted to get to know you and thought that the easiest way was to be civil to me, and to catch me by promising to give me a dog. I don’t know what he has promised you, nor why he is so friendly towards you. But I’m certain that he hopes to get something out of you, Mummy. He’s a rotter, a liar. You need only look at him to know what kind of beast he is. I hate him, yes, I hate him for his lies, his caddishness, his— ”

“But, Edgar, you must not speak like that...” she protested, while her heart told her that the child was right.

“You’ll never make me believe that he is anything but a cad. Can’t you see it for yourself? He’s afraid of me. Why should he be? He tries to hide his real motives from me. Why? Because he knows very well that I see through him, that I know him for what he is—a cad.”

“It’s not fair to say such things; really, it’s not fair.” Her mind had become a blank, and she could only reiterate the words “It’s not fair.”Panic seized her, but whether on the baron’s account or on the boy’s, she would have found it difficult to decide.

Edgar was well aware that he had made an impression.

He was tempted to lure her to his side and thus acquire a comrade to share in his hatred. He went over to where his mother was, put his arms round her, and said gently:

“Mummy darling, can’t you see for yourself that he’s a rotter? He has succeeded in changing you, in making you angry with me, because he wants you for himself alone. I’m sure he means to cheat you. Whatever he may have promised, he won t give—of that I am certain. Don’t trust him, Mummy. He’s cheated me, and he’ll cheat you. He’s a rotter, and no one ought to trust him.”

The child’s voice broke on the last words. It seemed as if she herself were speaking. And yet she felt ashamed to acknowledge that this youngster was right. She tried to maintain her dignity, as so many adults do, by assuming a lofty tone.

“Children are not the best judges in such matters. They don’t understand. This is no business of yours. All you have to do is to behave like a little gentleman...”

The tenderness vanished from Edgar’s countenance. He drew himself up, and said:

“Very well. You can’t say I failed to warn you.”

“So you are determined not to apologize?”

“Yes. Absolutely.”

They stood facing one another, and the woman felt that her authority was at stake.

“As you will, Edgar. You will have your meal served here. You will eat alone. And I shall not allow you to share our table until you have made suitable excuses. I’ll teach you your manners. You’ll not move from this room until I give you leave. Understand?”

Edgar grinned. This sardonic smile seemed to have become part of him. But he was vexed with himself for having warned her (who was just as flagrant a liar as the baron) against that “Vulgar beast’s”advances.

Meanwhile the lady had slammed the door behind her without a glance in his direction. She was awed by the child’s wrathful eyes. He had become uncanny, he knew too much, far more than it was desirable for him to know and to hear. He seemed to be an embodiment of her own conscience, a reproach and an admonition. Edgar had always been a plaything, an ornament to her life, a sweet and lovable object. Occasionally, it is true, he had proved a bit of a burden and a nuisance, but, taking the rough with the smooth, she had enjoyed his company, and their lives had run placidly side by side. For the first time the child had set up his will in opposition to her own. A breath of hate was now part of their relationship.

Yet even at this moment, as she made her way downstairs, she could hear the boy’s tender voice raised in warning against the man she was about to meet. She was unable to silence the inward monitor. As she passed a mirror on the landing, she stopped and contemplated her reflection. For long she looked at herself, deep, deep into her soul. Then she became aware of a smile playing about her lips, of her lips rounding themselves to pronounce a particular word—in the circumstances a dangerous word. Still the voice sounded within her; but she shrugged her shoulders as if shaking off an incubus, cast a bright glance at the answering image, smoothed her skirt, and marched off to her fate with the determination of a gambler staking his last gold piece upon the hazards of the game.

SHADOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT

A waiter brought up Edgar’s supper on a tray, made the boy as comfortable as possible, and then withdrew, closing the door behind him and turning the key in the lock. “Insufferable,” thought the boy, springing to his feet. To be bolted in as though he were a wild beast was too great an indignity. Could his mother really have brought this degradation upon him? His mind darkened as he meditated.

“I wonder what can be going on down there while I’m caged in this room. What are they talking about? Will their secret be disclosed, when I’m not there to share it with them? It’s awful to feel there’s a secret in the air, always when I’m with grown-ups. They shut me out, especially at night and talk in whispers if I drop in and take them unawares. I feel I’m on the track of their secret, and yet I just miss guessing what it’s all about. This isn’t the first time I’ve tried to understand. Those books I sneaked from Dad’s table and shelves! Only the trouble was that even when I had read them from cover to cover I never understood what they were driving at. There’s something that escapes me every time. How Emma, our parlourmaid, laughed at me when I begged her to explain a passage! Oh, I think it’s dreadful to be a child full of curiosity and not daring to ask questions. Grown-ups merely grin, and look down on a fellow as if he were a fool. But something tells me I’ll soon know everything there is to know. I’m not going to give in until I do....”

He strained his ears to catch a possible footstep. But only the breeze murmured in the foliage, swaying the branches and breaking the moonbeams into a thousand facets of light scattered among the shadows.

“They must be up to something they are ashamed of, otherwise why should they trouble to tell me such idiotic lies? I expect they’re having a good laugh at getting rid of me. Never fear, my turn will come. I’ve been a silly ass to allow them to lock me in. Ought to have stuck to them and never let them out of my sight. Grownups aren’t very clever at hiding what they are doing, and they’d be sure to give themselves away before long. They fancy we children go to sleep, and they forget that we know all kinds of dodges so as to overhear what they say and see what they do. We’re not so stupid as they imagine. When Aunt Clara had a baby two months ago they pretended to be ever so much surprised. But they had known about its coming ages before, and I knew too, because I heard them talking. This time also I’ll find out what Mother and the baron are hiding. I wish the doors were transparent so that I could watch them when they thought no one could see. I wonder if it would be a good move to ring for the chambermaid? She’d have to unlock the door to ask what I wanted. Then, before she knew what I was doing, I’d slip out...” No better not. That might give me away and show the servants how meanly I’m treated. No one must know, it would hurt too much, I couldn’t stand it. But to-morrow...”

A woman’s laugh floated up to him on the spring air, was that his mother? It might well be. She had plenty of reasons for being gay. Had she not locked him up, small and defenceless as he was, got rid of him thrown him into a corner like a bundle of dirty clothes? Stealthily creeping to the window, he peered out. A couple of girls were strolling by with their young men—no one else.

As he leaned on the sill, he noticed how close the window was to the ground; and, before he realized what he was doing, he had taken the plunge and landed in a bed of flowers. The slight noise he made passed unnoticed. He was free. Now he could go and spy upon his foes. In two days, this attitude of spying had become second nature to him who hitherto had been so candid and innocent. Careful to avoid making a sound, he prowled round the hotel, his heart beating furiously lest he should be discovered. Here was the dining-room. With the utmost precaution he pressed his face close to a window-pane: The pair were not there. He passed from window to window, not daring to enter the building in case he should stumble upon them in a passage or on the stair. He failed in his search and was in despair. Then, of a sudden, he saw two shadows issuing from a side door. He ducked so as not to be discovered. Yes, it was his mother accompanied by the inevitable baron.“Just in time,” thought the boy. “What are they talking about? Wish this rotten wind wouldn’t make such a row among the trees!” His mother laughed audibly. He had never heard her laugh like that; it sounded shrill, a trifle excited; most peculiar. Though Edgar felt alarmed at this unusual mirth, he was likewise reassured for, if she felt merry, there certainly could be no immediate danger threatening her. Nor could the matter the twain had in hand be anything of grave importance. Why, then, were they at such pains to hide it from him? Edgar felt rather disappointed at the thought that the secret was not something big, and worthy of the trouble he was taking to unravel it.

Whither could they be going at this hour of the night? High up in the sky a strong wind must be blowing for the clouds were racing by, obscuring the moon. So dark was it at times that one could not see the path, and then all at once the earth was radiant with clarity, and a silver sheen lay on leaf and blade. How strange, how eerie was the interplay of light and shade—like a nymph unveiling and veiling her beauties ere you could feast your eyes on her nakedness. Again the moon shone out, and Edgar saw two silhouettes—or, rather, one only, so closely were the couple walking together—making towards the forest. Why? Whither? The wind was busy among the firs.

“I’ll follow,” thought the child. “They’ll never hear my footsteps in such a din.”

Thrice blessed wind thus to muffle his movements! He slid from tree to tree, from shadow to shadow. Thrice cursed wind thus to muffle their words so that he could not hear what the enemy was talking about. If he once caught the subject of their conversation, he felt convinced that the secret would be his.

Unconcernedly, Frau Blumental and her cavalier went on their way, little suspecting the presence of a spy in their wake. They were entirely happy, and were lost to everything but the splendour of the night and their own growing interest in one another. How could they know that every step they took was dogged, and that eager eyes were watching them with hatred and curiosity?

Suddenly they stopped in the middle of the path. Edgar pressed his frail body against a tree. He gasped with anxiety. “Suppose they turn back, and Mother doesn’t find me in my room? She’ll guess I’ve been watching her, and then she’ll be so wary that I shall never discover their secret.” Happily at that moment the clouds scurried by, the moon shone, and the clearing was flooded with light. The boy saw that the baron was trying to entice the lady into a smaller and darker path which led up a little ravine. Edgar’s mother seemed to be saying “No,” but Sternfeldt urged her to consent. Why? What did he want of her? The books Edgar had read told of “Murders under cover of darkness”, of “Abduction”, of crimes innumerable. Could the baron be planning to kill her? Then here was the explanation, this was Sternfeldt had wanted to be alone with Mother, this was the reason he had induced Mother to turn the key on her own son. Should he seek help? Should he cry, “Murder”? He could not utter the syllables, for his lips were parched with excitement. So intense was his emotion that he found it difficult to keep his footing. He swayed; and, in order to steady himself, seized hold of a branch. It snapped with a loud report.

The two swung round in alarm and stared into the gloom. Edgar stood motionless, hardly daring to breathe. The silence of death lay upon the forest, for neither wind nor creature stirred. Then the woman said:

“Let us turn back.”

How scared she seemed. The baron, too, was frightened and fell in with her wishes. Linked in a close embrace they retraced their steps, slowly, engrossed in their own thoughts. Edgar, profiting by their absorption ran on all fours through the undergrowth, and arrived breathless at the hotel. Turning the key, he entered his room, undressed, and got into bed. He lay quiet for a while, recovering. Then he got up and went to the window, determined to witness their return. They must have walked very, very slowly. At long last he saw their shadows. They looked ghostly in the moonlight. Was the baron really a murderer in disguise? And had he, Edgar, prevented the bloody deed by breaking a dried and rotted branch? Again the moon shone brightly. Edgar had never seen an expression of such rapture on his mother’s face before. But the baron looked wooden and disappointed—probably because his wicked scheme had come to naught, thought the boy.

As they drew near to the hotel they wrenched themselves apart. Would they glance up? No! “They have quite forgotten me!” Then with a mixture of triumph and bitterness Edgar muttered: “But I haven’t forgotten you. You may fancy I am asleep or that I simply don’t exist at all. Just wait; I’ll show you how mistaken you are. I’m not going to let you out of my sight until I have snatched your secret from you. I’ll keep awake all right.”

The two stepped into the doorway. Again their shadows were united to form but one dark patch. Then the moonlight invaded the courtyard, until it looked like a field of untrodden snow.

A MIDNIGHT TUSSLE

With a catch in his breath, Edgar withdrew from the window. He was terribly shaken. Never had he been so near to discovering the riddle. Excitement, adventure, murder, betrayal, these had been no more than tales a boy reads of in books, dream events, unreal, unattainable. Now, of a sudden, he felt that this awful world of risk and enterprise had roped him in, had made of him a participant. He was alarmed and pleased at so unexpected an initiation.

“I wonder what kind of a man this is who has come into our lives....Can he really be a murderer? If not, why does he want to lure my mother into dark and lonely places?”

Something terrible seemed impending, and yet the boy did not know what steps to take in order to avert the evil. Of one thing he was certain: To-morrow he would write or wire to his father. But might not that be too late? Who could tell what would happen this very night? Mother had not come up to her room; she must still be with that wretch....

Between one door and the other of their rooms, which were in suite, was a small lobby. Here Edgar ensconced himself, determined not to miss his chance of hearing whatever happened in the corridor. At length he heard their steps. He strained every nerve to catch what they were saying and doing.

How slow they were—just as though they were climbing a mountain, not in the least as if they were making for their rooms, tired, after a pleasant evening together. They were constantly stopping and whispering. The boy trembled with mental torment. He would have given almost anything to hear what they were saying. Still, he knew they were coming his way. But, oh, how slowly! Now he could hear the baron pleading. Now his mother’s voice saying: “No. Not to-night. No.”

Edgar shivered. Every step that brought them nearer him caused him fresh agony. Then he heard the detested voice pleading:

“Please, please. Don’t say no. You’ve been so adorable the whole evening....”

And his mother, frightened, on the defensive, answering:

“I dare not. No, really, not to-night. I beg you, let me go.”

Again Edgar wondered what the baron wanted her to do and why his mother was so alarmed. Now they came to a standstill opposite the door behind which the child was lurking. He could hear them so clearly that they might have been in the same room with him.

“Come along, Mathilde, do! Please, please.”

His mother sighed; her protests became weaker. Hullo! What was happening? Frau Blumental did not enter her room, she passed along the passage. What did this mean? Why were they no longer talking together? Was it possible that the wretch had gagged her and was now in the act of throttling her?

Maddened with alarm, the child opened the door only a crack, but through this he could see what was going on. The baron had his arm round his mother’s waist and was cajoling her into acquiescence. She seemed to be nothing loath. Arrived at Sternfeldt’s door they stopped.

“Now he’s going to commit the crime,” thought the boy, his head filled with reminiscences of penny dreadful stories.

Banging the door behind him, he stampeded down the passage and butted in upon the lovers. His mother drew abruptly aside, alarmed by the sudden onslaught. Then she dropped as if in a faint, and was caught in the baron’s arms. At the same time, the baron became aware of two small fists pummelling his face, bashing his lips against his teeth, and nails scratching him like a cat’s claws. The alarmed woman quickly took to her heels, while the man hit back at his assailant before grasping who it was.

Edgar was only too conscious of the fact that his puny strength could not hold out against the vigorous onslaught of a man in the prime of life. Nevertheless he determined to do his best, and at least to show the intensity of his hatred. He banged away with all his might, his lips set firm, his teeth clenched. By now the baron had recognized the spy, and gave the lad a generous drubbing. He was furious at having his holiday ruined by this tiresome young monkey. Edgar suffered without uttering a sound. The struggle continued for several minutes in the dimly lighted passage until Sternfeldt, growing aware how ludicrous was this encounter between a man and a child, tried to seize Edgar by the nape and hold the boy at arm’s length. Feeling that he would be overpowered by the man’s superior strength and longer reach, the youngster turned savagely and clenched his teeth in Sternfeldt’s right hand. A low growl issued from the baron’s throat he relaxed his grip, and before he could recover his presence of mind Edgar was back in his own room and had bolted the door.

No one had been aware of this midnight affray. All were asleep. Everything was as still and silent as the tomb. Otto wiped the blood from his hand with a handkerchief. He peered uneasily into the dark recesses of the corridor. Not a soul to be seen! And yet, up there, was there not a light, flickering in the draught and a low, mocking laugh?

STORM

“Was it all a terrible dream?” Edgar asked himself when he awoke next morning. His head ached and as his eyes travelled down his body he saw that he had gone to sleep in his clothes. He jumped up, and ran to the looking-glass. There he was confronted with a pale, drawn face, tousled hair, a red swelling upon a smudgy forehead. With an effort the child collected his thoughts, trying to remember what had happened. Yes, he had come to fisticuffs with his enemy, out there in the passage, sometime after midnight; had then rushed back to his room; had thought of decamping; had been overwhelmed by fatigue; had thrown himself on to his bed without undressing; and had fallen into a restless sleep,full of nightmares and the stench of freshly spilled blood.

In the garden below he could hear the sound of foot-steps on the gravel; voices floated up to him; the sun was high in the heavens. It must be late. He consulted his watch, but found it had stopped.

In his excitement he had forgotten to wind it up. Curiously enough this uncertainty as to the hour disquieted him more than anything else. He quickly undressed, washed, and dressed himself again. Then he went downstairs, feeling slightly guilty and very much disturbed.

He found his mother sitting in the dining-room over her breakfast. Alone, thank goodness. It was a relief not to have to look upon that hated countenance....But Edgar was not quite sure of himself as he stepped up to the table and wished his mother “Good morning.”

She gave no response, continuing to stare fixedly out of the window. Her face was very pale, deep shadows lay around her eyes, and her delicate nostrils quivered as they invariably did when she was greatly moved. Edgar bit his lips. Her silence puzzled him. Did she know who had attacked Otto von Sternfeldt in the passage? Had he seriously damaged the baron? Doubts assailed him and tortured him. Her sightless, staring eyes alarmed him even more profoundly; he was afraid to move lest they should suddenly be turned upon him; he drank his coffee and ate his roll with as little movement as possible so as not to attract her attention. He thought she must be exceedingly angry. A quarter of an hour went by, while he waited for something to happen. Not a word was spoken. Then, still behaving as though he were not present, his mother got up and went out. What was he to do? Remain sitting at the table, or follow her? In the end, he decided upon the latter course. She continued to ignore him, so that he felt more and more humiliated. He lagged behind, not knowing whither to go. In the end, he went up to the suite he and his mother occupied—but found the outer door locked against him.

Yesterday’s hardihood had completely disappeared; he had not a notion what to do. Perhaps he had acted badly when he fell upon the baron tooth and nail. Could they be preparing some terrible retribution or a fresh humiliation? He was convinced they were concocting a plan, setting a trap for unwary feet. There was a feeling about these two as when a storm is brewing and flashes of lightning speed from cloud to cloud. This burden of misgiving weighed heavily upon his spirit throughout the morning, and it was a very small and diminished Edgar who finally presented himself at the luncheon table.

“Good day,” he said, once more endeavouring to break the silence which hung like a threatening cloud over his head.

She looked through him, and again made no answer. Edgar now recognized how terribly angry she was, so angry, indeed, that she did not venture to speak. Never had he roused her to such a pitch of exasperation. The boy’s heart sank; he was genuinely frightened. Hitherto when she had scolded him it was, rather, an affair of the nerves than of the emotions, a summer storm that was quickly over and followed by an indulgent laugh. To-day he felt that he had stirred her to the depths, had aroused something wild and untamed in her nature, and he trembled in face of the forces he had unleashed. Hardly a morsel of food could he swallow; his throat as dry, his lips were cracked. His mother seemed unaware of his desperate plight. But when the horrible meal at last came to an end and they rose from table, Frau Blumental turned casually to her son and said:

“Come to my room, Edgar. I wish to have a few words with you.”

No threat in her voice, thank goodness! But, oh, how icy and aloof was her demeanour. Her words fell over Edgar like a cold douche and made him shiver. His defiance oozed away. Like a whipped cur, the child followed his mother in silence to her room.

She prolonged Edgar’s martyrdom by sitting for a while without uttering a word. Through the open window came the joyous laughter of children at play; but Edgar’s heart beat to suffocation. Frau Blumental, too, was ill at ease, avoiding her son’s eyes even when she began to speak to him.

“I don’t intend to tell you what I think of your conduct, Edgar. The mere thought of it horrifies me. You will pay for the consequences. But you are certainly not fit to mix with grown-ups and sensible people. I have written to your father and told him that your unruly behaviour needs stricter discipline than I am able to provide. I have suggested he find you a tutor, or that he send you to a boarding-school, where you will be taught your manners. That is all. I myself shall not bother about you any more.”

Edgar’s head sank on his breast. He knew that this was only a prologue, and that worse was in store. Frau Blumental continued:

“You will have to apologize to Baron von Sternfeldt....”

The boy trembled; but she was adamant, and refused him a moment’s pause for a protest.

“The baron left this morning and you will write him a letter to my dictation....”

Again Edgar made as though to speak, and again his mother went on precipitately:

“Not a word! Sit down. There is a sheet of paper and a pen....”

Edgar looked up at her. He read decision in her hard eyes. Never had she looked like this. He seated himself at the table, took up the pen, and bowed his head low over the paper.

“Date it. Done? Leave a line. Good. Now write ‘dear Baron von Sternfeldt.’ Comma. Leave another line. A little to the right, begin, ‘I am sorry to learn that you have left Semmering,’ two m’s in Semmering. Got that? Very well. Continue the sentence, after a comma, and that ‘I cannot say good-bye to you personally but only by letter’; hurry up, no need to write as if you were doing a copy. Full stop. ‘Also, I want to ask your pardon for my unseemly conduct last night. Mother told you that I am convalescent after a severe illness and am easily overwrought. That makes me do things for which I am very sorry afterwards....’”

The bowed back straightened; Edgar turned round, defiance blazing up anew.

“That’s not true; I won’t write...”

“Edgar,” cried his mother threateningly.

“It’s not true. I’ve done nothing to be sorry for. I’ve done nothing naughty for which I need beg anyone’s pardon. All I did was to run to your side when you called for help.”

Her lips blanched; her nostrils quivered. “I called for help? You’re crazy.” Edgar sprang fiercely to his feet.

“Yes, you did, out there in the passage, last night, when he caught hold of you. ‘Let go of me. Leave me,’ you said so loud that I could hear the words quite plainly from my room.”

“You are lying, my poor child. The baron and I were not in the passage. He merely saw me to the landing.”

Such a brazen falsehood took the boy’s breath away. He was stunned, looking at her with scared eyes, and stammering:

“You...were...not in...the passage? And he...did not...take...hold of you? Forcibly....against your will...?”

She laughed; a cold, dry laugh.

“Must have been dreaming, my boy.”

This was too much for Edgar. He knew that grownups lied, that they used funny words to express what was not true, told fibs, had recourse to strange ambiguities. But anything as bold-faced as this he was utterly unprepared for.

“And is this huge bump on my forehead also a dream?”

“How am I to know what other young jackanapes you’ve been fighting with? Come now, I don’t want any back-talk from you. Sit down and write.”

She had gone very pale, and was making a great effort to remain calm.

But Edgar crumpled up; a last faint ember of credulity and trust in his elders was quenched. How could anyone trample on truth so ruthlessly? He would not believe that a monstrous lie such as this could go unscathed. He rallied his forces, became cool and collected and bitter. An ironical, bantering, and sarcastic tone entered his voice.

“So I’ve been dreaming, have I? All that happened in the passage, this bump on my forehead-just a dream! And of course you and he did not go for a walk in the moonlight. Neither did he try to get you down a small dark path in the forest. Oh, no, nothing of that is true, is it? But did you really fancy I was going to allow myself to be locked into my room like a naughty child? Not such an ass. I know what I know.”

He looked her squarely and pertly in the face, and this saucy expression cowed her for a moment. It was dreadful to see hatred gleaming from the eyes of her only child. Then her anger broke loose.

“Enough! Write what I tell you, immediately otherwise...”

“Otherwise what?” he demanded peremptorily.

“Otherwise I’ll beat you as if you were in very fact a little child.”

Edgar stepped close up to his mother a jeering and challenging laugh issuing from his mouth.

Her hand was already raised and came down in a resounding smack upon his head. He uttered a yell of rage and surprise. Then, like a drowning man whose ears are buzzing, whose hands vainly strive to find some flotsam whereon to cling, he struck out blindly. Something soft and yielding countered his fists. Again he struck, this time upwards towards a blanched face. A cry...

The scream of pain brought him to his senses. What had he done? Something terrible, something unforgivable. He had struck his mother. Frightened, ashamed, disgusted, he wished the floor would open and swallow him up. He must get away from those horrified eyes. Away...away. Edgar stumbled towards the door, down the stairs, through the hall, into the forest. Oh, to get away, far away! He rushed along as if pursued by a pack of hounds giving tongue.

REVELATION

At length Edgar halted. His limbs, his body trembled violently that he had to support himself against a tree. His breath came quickly and spasmodically. What was he to do? Where could he go? Impossible to remain here, almost within sight of the house which had been his temporary home. He was forsaken, helpless. The world was a harsh and unfeeling place. Even the trees which but yesterday afforded shelter from the sun and had clustered round him in brotherly affection, now stood aloof and looked down grimly. The unknown lay ahead of him. His loneliness amid the vastness of nature filled him with dread. Such solitude could not be borne, he must go somewhere and find a companion. He dared not seek out his father in Vienna, for Herr Blumental was a martinet and would insist upon Edgar’s prompt return to Semmering. This thought was intolerable. Better by far to be alone and to journey forth into the unexplored. He felt as if never again could he look his mother in the face without remembering that he had struck her with his fist.

But what about Grandma? She had always made much of him—such a kind old lady. Invariably she had been on his side when he had got into trouble at home. He could hide in her house in Baden until his parents’ anger had cooled off. From there he would write a long letter, begging Dad and Mummy to forgive him. All the pride had seeped out of him. He felt very small and helpless in the midst of this huge and antagonistic universe, and wanted nothing better than to become once again the child he had been a few days ago.

How did one get to Baden, he wondered. Pulling out a shabby purse which was his inseparable companion, he extracted a gold piece that had been given him for his birthday. How he had polished it every day with his grubby handkerchief, until it shone and shone again! He had never been able to make up his mind to spend it. Like a little sun it was. Lovely. Bright. Beautiful. Would it suffice to pay for his railway fare? Often and often he had travelled by train! Yet never had it entered his head to inquire how much a journey cost. For the first time in his short life he was up against reality. Things he had taken for granted apparently possessed a value of their own and could not be had for the asking. They needed to be paid for in hard cash. A short hour ago he thought himself so wonderfully clever, knowing all there was to know. But there were hundreds of problems and secrets that were a sealed book to him. He realized his shortcomings now. More and more did the sense of humiliation master him as he made his way to the station. Often and often he had dreamed of setting forth into the world to win his laurels, to become an emperor, a king, a famous soldier, a poet. Now that he had finally realized part of this dream, he felt exceeding small, and, as he fixed his eyes on the station building, his mind was wholly preoccupied with the question: “Shall I have enough to pay for my ticket?” The shining rails ran away into the infinite; not a soul could be seen on the platform or in the waiting-room. Edgar tiptoed up to the ticket office and asked softly and modestly how much it cost to go to Baden. A pair of surprised eyes looked through the little hole, and smiled not unkindly at the timid youngster.

“Half fare, or a whole?”

“Whole,” stammered Edgar, every atom of conceit punched out of him.

“Six crowns.”

“Please give me a ticket.”

He shoved the shining treasure across the diminutive counter, picked up the ticket and change. The piece of cardboard spelled freedom. He thrust the silver coins into his pocket, and listened well satisfied to the muffled clinking as they rattled together.

Only twenty minutes till the train was due. Edgar crept into a doorway so that no one should catch sight of him. A few passengers trailed in and wandered aimlessly about the platform. They failed to notice the runaway, though he himself felt as if all eyes were upon him. A whistle in the distance came as an immense relief to his suspense. Here was the train destined to convey him right away into the world. It was not until he had already stepped into a first-class carriage that he noticed he had been given a third-class ticket. So there were differences between travellers, he thought. Another initiation! His neighbours, when he had rectified his mistake, were a couple of Italian workmen, with calloused hands and rough voices. They had slung their tools on to the rack, and were sitting relaxed and listless. “They must have been working very hard, mused the child as one of them nodded off to sleep. I suppose they earned money for what they did. How much I wonder?”Money, then, was a thing one had to earn, that one was not automatically provided with. So far Edgar had taken his comfortable circumstances for granted, and had never given a thought to those abysses of misery which beset him on either hand. There were professions and trades to be followed, incomes to be earned—so many secrets he had never even noticed. He had learned much during his hour of solitude; and, as he cogitated these problems yet further and gazed at the fleeing landscape through the window, greater and greater illumination came to him. Gradually amid his gloomy anxiety, something seemed to grow, up and to blossom as he became conscious of the amazing kaleidoscope presented to him by life. He had run away because he was a coward and had been scared: true, but through his poltroonery he had come to taste the sweets of independence, he had come into contact with a reality he had hitherto completely ignored. Was he himself not just as great an enigma to his father and mother as the world had been to him? Quite possible. He saw with a new vision, as if manifold veils had been torn away from his eyes, as if the inside of things was being revealed to him, as if the secret of secrets was being disclosed. Houses flew past as though borne on the wings of the wind. Who were the people dwelling inside all these cottages and farmsteads, Edgar wondered. Were they rich or poor, happy or unhappy; were they full of uneasy longing as he was; did they want to know everything; were the children, like himself so far, merely playing with life? At the level crossings, the switchmen with their little flags were no longer the puppets he had always thought them, toy men, objects set up at those particular spots by chance. Edgar understood now that they had a function to perform, that they were fulfilling their destiny, had entered upon the struggle for life. The train gained in speed as it wound its way down the valley, leaving the high mountains behind. The contours were softened with the tender green of springtime. Only once did the fugitive look back at the high country he had left. The hills were blue distant, unattainable. As they receded more and more, and were swallowed up in the late afternoon fogs, it seemed to him that he had left childhood behind for ever in those remote and austere regions.

BEWILDERING DARKNESS

When at length he stood alone on the platform at Baden, watched the signal lights, and realized that night was upon him, his more hopeful and cheery mood petered out, and he felt an immense desolation descending upon him. While daylight lasted he had been surrounded by human beings; there were all manner of interesting things a small boy could do, sit on a bench and watch the passers-by, wander along streets looking into shop windows. But what was going to happen when everyone withdrew behind closed doors, when they retired to bed, went to sleep, while he, feeling guilty of wrong-doing, slunk about the empty streets, unwontedly alone and forsaken? He must seek shelter at once, not a minute to waste; of that he was profoundly convinced.

Without casting a look to right or to left he made a bee-line towards his grandmother’s villa. It lay back from the road in a garden sheltered by shrubberies and covered with ivy and other creepers. It peeped out white within its framework of green, a friendly, old-fashioned abode. Edgar looked over the hedge, feeling almost like a stranger. Nothing stirred, no lights shone from the windows; Grannie and her guests were probably sitting over their coffee on the lawn to the rear.

He already had his hand on the bell-pull, when an alarming thought entered his mind. So far his resolve to ask his dear Grannie for shelter had seemed quite natural to him. But suddenly he had a doubt. What excuse could he furnish for his unexpected arrival? How was he to answer her inevitable questions? He saw in fancy the old lady’s look of surprise when he told her that he had run away from his mother. Besides, he would have to confess having hit his mother, and the enormity of this crime weighed heavily upon him. A door banged. He started violently, and panic seized him. Suppose someone came out and caught him loitering! He scampered off, hardly knowing where his legs were taking him.

Arrived at the town-park gates, he came to a stop. Here it was very dark, and no one was to be seen. Perhaps he could find a vacant seat, sit down quietly, and think over the situation undisturbed. He slunk along a deserted alley-way. The trees looked ghostly in the dim light of the lamps, but farther on, up a little hill which he climbed, everything lay in darkness, the mist-laden gloom of a spring night. A solitary couple or two sat absorbed. He passed quickly by, for he wanted to be alone. But no solitude was to be found. Whispers could be heard coming from the shadowy depths of trees and bushes, borne upon the wind, mingling with the rustle of leaves and grass-blades; stealthy footsteps sounded along the paths, a sigh, a low laugh, mysterious, voluptuous. Did these murmurs come from human beings or from the beasts? Nature seemed wrapped in sleep, and yet all things were astir. A ferment of living matter was at work disquieting in the extreme to a highly-strung child. Could It all be part of the springtime?

Never had he felt smaller and more impotent, as he huddled upon a bench and tried to think out what he should do, and how explain his flight. But he found it impossible to concentrate his thoughts. In spite of his best endeavours, his ears were always pricked to catch the sound of those mysterious voices issuing from the gloom. The darkness was terrible and perplexing? yet how enigmatically beautiful! This rustling and soughing, this whirring and allurement, did it emanate from animals or from men? Or was it merely the breeze among the boughs? Edgar listened. Yes it was the wind shaking the leaves....No, it came from that couple over there, held in a tight embrace. Man and woman. They had strolled hither from the glare of the town, in order to be alone in the darkness. What were they up to? If he could only find an answer to that question he would find peace, and his tortured mind would be at rest. Two people, but so closely pressed together as to form but a single shadow-just as it had been with his mother and the baron...So the fateful secret clung to this place too? Footsteps drew nearer, a soft gurgle of laughter could be heard. Supposing this approaching couple should catch sight of him? He cowered farther back into the darkness. But they did not see him. They passed quietly by, wrapped in one another’s embrace. Edgar was beginning to breathe freely once more when they stopped, pressing their faces together, and a sigh of content escaped from the woman’s mouth. The man spoke a few rapid words. Edgar felt horribly frightened, and at the same time he thrilled with an unknown pleasure. A minute later the gravel crunched beneath their feet; the pair were swallowed up in the shadows. .

Edgar’s pulses beat furiously, and a sense of solitude gripped him. He longed to hear the sound of a friendly voice; to feel an affectionate hug; to see a lighted and familiar room, people he knew and loved. The uncanny darkness of the night had sunk into his very marrow. He would burst if he did not shake himself free.

Home! Home! A warm and lighted room! Persons he knew! All would be well, then. Nothing bad could happen if he were once with his own people. They might scold him or even beat him, he did not care so long as he had no more to dwell in darkness and solitude.

Hardly knowing what he did he ran on and on, till again he found himself in front of Grandma's house, with his hand ready to pull the bell. Through the curtain of greenery, he saw that the windows were alight;in imagination he pictured the familiar rooms, and their occupants. This proximity was a pleasure; and if he still hesitated to ring, it was merely to revel in his happiness, in the knowledge that he was near to those he loved and who loved him.

A shrill voice behind him brought him back to earth.

“Master Edgar, why, here you are at last!”

It was his Grannie’s housemaid who had come out for an airing. She ran up to the boy and gave him a hearty embrace. The doors, magically, swung open, the dogs dashed down the drive to bark a welcome, people were coming from the house with candles and lanterns, voices of mingled alarm and delight sounded in his ears, a friendly tumult of noises, shapes of persons he knew....His grandmother, who hugged him tight, and behind her—could he be dreaming?—his mother. Abashed, trembling, on the verge of tears, the boy stood stockstill, not knowing which way to turn or what to do. Was he frightened? Or was he happy?

THE LAST DREAM

Yes, it was his mother. Through inquiries made at Simmering station, she had traced the direction of his flight. She had wired to her husband in Vienna, to Grannie in Baden. He was expected. Why had he not arrived ? Frau Blumental, taking the express, had outstripped him. They led him in subdued triumph to the sitting-room. True, he was scolded; but the scoldings did not wound him, for in the eyes of those that scolded he saw nothing but joy and love. Even their assumed anger could not last; it fizzled out almost before the reprimand had been made. Now Grannie was hugging him again, and crying over him. No one reproached him. Wonderful! He felt as though he were a prisoner of love. The maid pulled off his thin coat and muffled him in a warm shawl; asked him if he were not hungry, or if there was anything she could bring him. He had hated being looked upon as a child; but now he revelled in the bliss of being cared for. The arrogance and presumption of the last few days vanished.

The telephone buzzed in the neighbouring room. His mother answered the call. “Yes...Edgar’s come...it’s all right... Why was she not furious with him, he wondered. Her dear eyes caressed him with a strange expression. His immediate impulse was to disregard all the coddling his Grannie and his Aunt Bertha were lavishing upon him and to throw himself into Mummy’s arms, to tell her how sorry he was, to promise anything she liked. He got up. But Grannie asked in alarm:

“Where are you going, pet?”

Anxious, were they, if he so much as moved? They fancied he was running away again. So he had given them all a jolly good fright? How could he ever make them understand that no one regretted this flight so much as he.

They served him an impromptu supper. Grannie sat by him, and never took her eyes off him. She and Auntie and the maid formed a loving circle round him. The warmth of their affection solaced him marvellously. But why was his mother not present? He felt uneasy at her absence. If she could only guess how utterly crushed he was...

A carriage drew up outside. Grannie left the room. Amid a medley of voices he recognized his father’s. Auntie and the maid had also gone out into the hall. Edgar was again alone, and again he was frightened by solitude. His father had always treated the boy with the utmost severity, and had made himself feared. Now Edgar listened to his father’s voice on the other side of the door. He appeared to be excited, and spoke in loud and angry tones. Grannie and Mummy seemed to be using their best endeavours to appease him. Resolute footsteps approached. The door opened.

Herr Blumental was a very tall man, so that Edgar felt as tiny as a doll when he was asked, in a harsh voice:

“What possessed you to run away and give your mother such a fright, you young scoundrel?”

The man was genuinely angry; but Mummy came in directly behind her husband. Her face was in shadow so that the boy could not take his cue from her and therefore, did not answer.

“Well? Lost your tongue? What was wrong? Own up, don’t be afraid. There must be some reason for running away. Anybody hurt your feelings?”

Edgar hesitated to reply. Anger and pique revived in him. Should he justify himself? He raised his eyes and looked at his mother. She was still in her husband’s huge shadow, but the boy saw her make an unwonted gesture. She slowly raised a finger to her lips, and her eyes implored silence.

The child’s heart warmed. He understood that she was begging him to keep her secret. How proud and happy he felt that she should ask him this service. Pulling himself together, he said:

“No, Dad! I was having a lovely time. Mummy was ever so good to me. But suddenly I felt I had to do something thoroughly naughty. So I ran away.”

Herr Blumental looked at his son dubiously. He had expected anything but this, and was disarmed by so abject a confession.

“Well,” he answered, “If you’re sorry, there’s no more to be said. Another time I trust you will reflect before behaving so rashly.” He gazed kindly down at the boy and his voice took on a softer tone. “You’re looking a bit pale, but you’ve grown a lot since you left home. Don’t be up to any more childish pranks. You are no longer a kid, and must try in future to be reasonable....”

Edgar gazed fixedly at his mother. There was a gleam in her eyes he had never seen before, they were moist and bright, while round her mouth played an elfin smile which seemed full of gratitude.

He was now sent off to bed, but he felt no resentment, neither did he mind being left alone once more. His head buzzed with thoughts. All the suffering of the last few days was swallowed up in the freshness and delight of this first real experience, and he looked forward undauntedly to further encounters with reality. The trees without soughed and swayed in the wind, but he was not saddened by the noise. Life was rich and manifold; he had seen it naked before him, bereft of lies and subterfuges, full of a perilous beauty. Hatred for persons or things seemed to him now a childish stupidity and misapprehension. Even the baron, his enemy, shared in the boy’s exuberant gratitude, because it had been through this false friend that the door into a wonderland of the emotions had been opened.

He lay in the dark, contented, proud, and happy. Sleep had almost enfolded him, when he became aware of someone moving softly in the room and of a hand gently stroking his hair. Tears dropped on to his cheeks...and, without a word, his mother kissed him fondly. Not until many years later did Edgar understand the full meaning of these tears and kisses. They were a vow that henceforward Mummy would devote all her energies, all her love to him; that there would be no more adventures in her life; that she had said farewell to the pleasures of the flesh. She was grateful to her child for saving her from a futile and unworthy liaison; and, in a bitter-sweet compunction, she pledged herself to her boy’s service. Though Edgar could not, child that he still was, grasp the significance of all this at the time, he nevertheless felt that it was glorious to be loved so much, and he surmised that in some incomprehensible manner such love was inextricably interwoven with the major secret of life.

After she had withdrawn and closed the door behind her, Edgar felt her presence and the warm glow of her lips upon his cheek. As he gradually dropped off to sleep, he drowsily wished he might often feel the pressure of soft lips against his own. A final and confused vision of the last eventful days swept before him; fate turned the pages of the Book of Youth; the child fell asleep, and the profound dream of life began to unfold itself.





THE GOVERNESS


THE two girls were alone in their room. The light had been extinguished, and all was dark except for a faint shimmer from the two beds. They were both breathing so quietly that they might have been supposed to be asleep.

“I say,” came a gentle, hesitating whisper from one of the beds. The twelve-year-old girl was speaking.

“What is it?” asked her sister, who was a year older. “I’m so glad you’re still awake. I’ve something to tell you.”

There was no answer in words, only a rustle from the other bed. The elder girl had sat up, and was waiting, her eyes a sparkle in the dim light.

“Look here, this is what I want to tell you. But, first of all, have you noticed anything funny about Miss Mann lately?”

“Yes,” said the other after a moment’s silence. “There is something, but I hardly know what. She’s not so strict as she used to be. For two days I haven’t done my exercises, and she never scolded me about it. I don’t know what’s happened, but she doesn’t seem to bother about us any more. She sits all by herself, and doesn’t join in our games as she used to.”

“I think she’s unhappy, and tries not to show it. She never plays the piano now.”

There was a pause, and then the elder girl spoke once more:

“You said you had something to tell me.”

“Yes, but you must keep it to yourself. You mustn’t breathe a word about it to Mother, or to your friend, Lottie.”

“Of course I won’t,” answered the other indignantly. “Do get on!”

“Well, after we’d come up to bed, it suddenly struck me that I’d never said good night to Miss Mann. I didn’t bother to put on my shoes again, and I tiptoed across to her room, meaning to give her a surprise.So I opened her door quietly, and for a moment I thought she wasn’t there. The light was on, but I couldn’t see her. Then suddenly—I was quite startled—I heard someone crying, and I saw that she was lying dressed on her bed, her head buried in the pillows. She was sobbing so dreadfully that it made me feel all queer, but she never noticed me. Then I crept out and shut the door as softly as I could. I stood outside there for a moment, for I could hardly walk, and through the door I could still hear her sobbing. Then I came back.”

Neither of them spoke for a moment. Then the elder girl said with a sigh:

“Poor Miss Mann!” and there was another pause.

“I wonder what on earth she was crying about,” resumed the younger girl. “She hasn’t been in any row lately, for Mother hasn’t been nagging at her as she always used to, and I’m sure we’ve not been troublesome. What can there be to make her cry?”

“I think I can guess,” said the elder.

“Well, out with it!”

The answer was delayed, but at length it came:

“I believe she’s in love.”

“In love?” The younger girl started up. “In love? Who with?”

“Haven’t you noticed?”

“You can’t mean Otto?”

“Of course I do! And he’s in love with her. All the three years he’s been living with us he never came for a walk with us until two or three months ago. But now he doesn’t miss a day. He hardly noticed either of us until Miss Mann came. Now he’s always fussing round. Every time we go out, we seem to run across him, either in the Park or in the Gardens or somewhere—wherever Miss Mann takes us. Surely you’ve noticed?”

“Yes, of course I’ve noticed,” answered the younger. “But I just thought...”

She did not finish her sentence.

“Oh, I didn’t want to make too much of it either. But after a time I was sure that he was only using us as an excuse.”

There was a long silence, while the girls were thinking things over.The younger was the first to resume the conversation. “But if so, why should she cry? He’s very fond of her. I’ve always thought it must be so jolly to be in love.”

“So have I,” said the elder dreamily. “I can’t make it out.”

Once more came the words, in a drowsy voice:“ Poor Miss Mann!”

So their talk ended for that night.

They did not allude to the matter again in the morning, but each knew that the other’s thoughts were full of it. Not that they looked meaningly at one another, but in spite of themselves they would exchange glances when their eyes had rested on the governess. At meals they contemplated their cousin Otto aloofly, as if he had been a stranger. They did not speak to him, but scrutinized him furtively, trying to discover if he had a secret understanding with Miss Mann. They had no heart in their amusements, for they could think of nothing but this urgent enigma. In the evening, with an assumption of indifference, one of them asked the other:

“Did you notice anything more to-day?”

“No,” said the sister, laconically.

They were really afraid to discuss the subject. Thus matters continued for several days. The two girls were silently taking notes, uneasy in mind and yet feeling that they were on the verge of discovering a wonderful secret.

At length, it was at supper, the younger girl noticed that the governess made an almost imperceptible sign to Otto, and that he nodded in answer. Trembling with excitement, she gave her sister a gentle kick under cover of the table. The elder looked inquiringly at the younger, who responded with a meaning glance. Both were on tenterhooks for the rest of the meal. After supper the governess said to the girls:

“Go to the schoolroom and find something to do. My head is aching, and I must lie down for half an hour.”

The instant they were alone, the younger burst out with:

“You’ll see, Otto will go into her room!”

“Of course,” said the other, “That’s why she sent us in here.”

“We must listen outside the door.”

“But suppose someone should come...”

“Who?”

“Mother.”

“That would be awful,” exclaimed the younger in alarm.

“look here, I’ll listen, and you must keep cavy in the passage.”

The little one pouted.

“But then you won’t tell me everything.”

“No fear!”

“Honour bright?”

“Honour bright! You must cough if you hear anyone coming.”They waited in the passage, their hearts throbbing with excitement. What was going to happen? They heard a footstep, and stole into the dark schoolroom. Yes, it was Otto. He went into Miss Mann’s room and closed the door. The elder girl shot to her post, and listened at the keyhole, hardly daring to breathe. The younger looked enviously. Burning with curiosity, she too stole up to the door, but her sister pushed her away, and angrily signed to her to keep watch at the other end of the passage. Thus they waited for several minutes, which to the younger girl seemed an eternity. She was in a fever of impatience, and fidgeted as if she had been standing on hot coals. She could hardly restrain her tears because her sister was hearing everything. At length a noise startled her, and she coughed. Both the girls fled into the schoolroom, and a moment passed before they had breath enough to speak. Then the younger said eagerly:

“Now then, tell me all about it.”

The elder looked perplexed, and said, as if talking to herself:

“I don’t understand.”

“What?”

“It’s so extraordinary.”

“What? What?” said the other furiously.

The elder made an effort:

“It was extraordinary, quite different from what I expected. I think when he went into the room he must have wanted to put his arms round her or to kiss her, for she said: ‘Not now, I’ve something serious to tell you.’ I couldn’t see anything, for the key was in the way, but I could hear all right. ‘what’s up?’ asked Otto, in a tone I’ve never heard him use before. You know how he generally speaks, quite loud and cheekily, but now I am sure he was frightened. She must have noticed that he was humbugging, for all she said was: ‘I think you know well enough.’—‘Not a bit.’—‘If so,’ she said in ever so sad a tone, ‘why have you drawn away from me? For a week you’ve hardly spoken to me; you avoid me whenever you can; you are never with the girls now;you don’t come to meet us in the Park. Have you ceased to care for me all of a sudden? Oh, you know only too well why you are drawing back like this.’ There was no answer for a moment. Then he said: ‘Surely you realize how near it is to my examination. I have no time for anything but my work. How can I help that?’ She began to cry, and while sobbing, she said to him gently: ‘Otto, do speak the truth. What have I done that you should treat me like this? I have not made any claim on you, but we must talk things out frankly. Your expression shows me plainly that you know all about...’”

The girl began to shake, and could not finish her sentence. The listener pressed closer, and asked:

“All about what?”

“All about our baby!”

“Their baby!” the younger broke out. “A baby! Impossible!”

“That’s what she said.”

“You can’t have heard right.”

“But I did. I’m quite sure. And he repeated it: ‘Our baby!’ After a time she went on: ‘what are we to do now?’ Then...”

“Well?”

“Then you coughed, and I had to bolt for it.” The younger was frightfully perplexed.

“But she can’t have a baby. Where can the baby be?”

“I don’t understand any more than you.”

“Perhaps she’s got it at home. Of course, Mother would not let her bring it here. That must be why she is so unhappy.”

“Oh, rot, she didn’t know Otto then!”

They pondered helplessly. Again the younger girl said:

“A baby, it’s impossible. How can she have a baby? She’s not married, and only married people have children.” “Perhaps she is married.”

“Don’t be an idiot. She never married Otto, any-how.”

“Well, then?”

They stared at one another.

“Poor Miss Mann,” said one of them sorrowfully.

They always seemed to come back to this phrase, which was like a sigh of compassion. But always their curiosity blazed up once more.

“Do you think it’s a boy or a girl?”

“How on earth can I tell?”

“What if I were to ask her, tactfully?”

“Oh, shut up!”

“Why shouldn’t I? She’s so awfully nice to us.”

“What’s the use. They never tell us that sort of thing. If they are talking about them when we come into the room they immediately dry up, and begin to talk rot to us as if we were still kids—though I’m thirteen. What’s the use of asking her, just to be humbugged?”

“But I want to know.”

“Well, of course, I should like to know too.”

“What bothers me is that Otto pretended not to know anything about it. One must know when one has a baby, just as one knows one has a father and mother.”

“Oh, he was only putting it on. He’s always kidding!”

“But not about such a thing. It’s only when he wants to pull our leg.”

They were interrupted by the governess coming in at that moment, and they pretended to be hard at work. But it did not escape them that her eyelids were red, and that her voice betrayed deep emotion. They sat perfectly quiet, regarding her with a new respect. “She has a baby,” they kept on thinking; “That is why she is so sorrowful.” But upon them, too, sorrow was stealing unawares.

At dinner next day, they learned a startling piece of news. Otto was going away. He had told his uncle that he had to work extra hard just before examination, and that there were too many interruptions in the house. He was going into lodgings for the next two months.

The girls were bubbling with excitement. They felt sure that their cousin’s departure must be connected in some way with the previous day’s conversation. Instinct convinced them that this was a coward’s flight. When Otto came to say good-bye to them they were deliberately rude, and turned their backs on him. Nevertheless, they watched his farewell to Miss Mann. She shook hands with him calmly, but her lips twitched.

The girls were changed beings these days. They seldom laughed, could not take pleasure in anything, were sad-eyed. They prowled restlessly about, and distrusted their elders, suspecting that an intention to deceive was lurking behind the simplest utterance. Ever on the watch, they glided like shadows, and listened behind doors, eager to break through the net which shut them off from the mystery—or at least to catch through its meshes a glimpse into the world of reality. The faith, the contented blindness of childhood, had vanished. Besides, they were continually expecting some new revelation, and were afraid they might miss it. The atmosphere of deceit around them made them deceitful. Whenever their parents were near, they pretended to be busily engaged in childish occupations. Making common cause against the world of grown-ups, they were drawn more closely together. A caressive impulse would often make them embrace one another when overwhelmed by a sense of their ignorance and impotence; and sometimes they would burst into tears. Without obvious cause, their lives had passed into a critical phase.

Among their manifold troubles, one seemed worse than all the rest. Tacitly, quite independently of one another, they had made up their minds that they would give as little trouble as they could to Miss Mann, now that she was so unhappy. They were extremely diligent, helping one another in their lessons; were always quiet and well behaved; tried to anticipate their teacher’s wishes. But the governess never seemed to notice, and that was what hurt them more than anything. She was so different now. When one of the girls spoke to her, she would start as though from slumber, and her gaze seemed to come back to them as if it had been probing vast distances. For hours she would sit musing, and the girls would move on tiptoe lest they should disturb her, for they fancied she was thinking of her absent child. In their own awakening womanhood, they had become fonder than ever of the governess, who was now so gentle towards them. Miss Mann, who had been lively, and at times a trifle overbearing, was more thoughtful and considerate, and the girls felt that all her actions betrayed a secret sorrow. They never actually saw her weeping, but her eyelids were often red. It was plain she wanted to keep her troubles to herself, and they were deeply grieved not to be able to help her.

One day, when the governess had turned away towards the window to wipe her eyes, the younger girl plucked up courage to seize her hand and say: “Miss Mann, you are so sad. It’s not our fault, is it?”

The governess looked tenderly at the child, stroked her hair, and answered:

“No, dear. Of course it is not your fault.” She kissed the little maid’s forehead.

Thus the girls were continually on the watch, and one of them, coming unexpectedly into the sitting-room, caught a word or two that had not been intended for her ears. Her parents promptly changed the conversation, but the child had heard enough to set her thinking.

“Yes, I have been struck by the same thing,” the mother had been saying. “I shall have to speak to her.”

At first the little girl had fitted the cap on her own head, and had run to consult her sister.

“What do you think the row can be about?”

But at dinner-time they noticed how their father and mother were scrutinizing the governess, and how they then looked significantly at one another. After dinner, their mother said to Miss Mann:

“Will you come to my room please? I want to speak to you.”

The girls were tremulous with excitement. Something was going to happen! By now, eavesdropping had become a matter of course. They no longer felt any shame; their one thought was to discover what was being hidden from them. They were at the door in a flash, directly Miss Mann had entered.

They listened, but all they could hear was a faint murmur of conversation. Were they to learn nothing after all? Then one of the voices was raised. Their mother said angrily:

“Did you suppose we were all blind—that we should never notice your condition? This throws a pretty light upon your conception of your duties as a governess. I shudder to think that I have confided my daughters’ education to such hands. No doubt you have neglected them shamefully...”

The governess seemed to break in here with a protest, but she spoke softly, so that the girls could not hear.

“Talk, talk! Every wanton finds excuses. A woman such as you gives herself to the first comer without a thought of the consequences. God will provide! It’s monstrous that a hussy like you should become a governess. But I suppose you don’t flatter yourself that I shall let you stay in the house any longer?”

The listeners shuddered. They could not fully understand, but their mother’s tone seemed horrible to them. It was answered only by Miss Mann’s sobs. The tears burst from their own eyes. Their mother grew angrier than ever.

“That’s all you can do now, cry and snivel! Your tears won’t move me. I have no sympathy with such a person as you are. It’s no business of mine, what will happen to you. No doubt you know where to turn for help, and that’s your affair. All I know is that you shan’t stay another day in my house.”

Miss Mann’s despairing sobs were still the only answer. Never had they heard anyone cry in this fashion. Their feeling was that no one who cried so bitterly could possibly be in the wrong. Their mother waited in silence for a little while, and then said sharply: “Well, that’s all I have to say to you. Pack up your things this afternoon, and come to me for your salary to-morrow morning. You can go now.”

The girls fled back to their own room. What could have happened? What was the meaning of this sudden storm? In a glass darkly, they began to have some suspicion of the truth. For the first time, their feeling was one of revolt against their parents.

“Wasn’t it horrid of Mother to speak to her like that ?” said the elder.

The younger was a little alarmed at such frank criticism, and stammered:

“But...but...we don’t know what she’s done.”

“Nothing wrong, I’m certain. Miss Mann would never do anything wrong. Mother doesn’t know her as well as we do.”

“Wasn’t it awful, the way she cried? It did make me feel so bad.”

“Yes, it was dreadful. But the way Mother shouted at her was sickening, positively sickening!”

The speaker stamped angrily, and tears welled up into her eyes.

At this moment Miss Mann came in, looking utterly worn out.

“Girls, I have a lot to do this afternoon. I know you will be good, if I leave you to yourselves? We’ll have the evening together.”

She turned, and left the room, without noticing the children’s forlorn looks.

“Did you see how red her eyes were? I simply can’t understand how Mother could be so unkind to her.”

“Poor Miss Mann!”

Again this lament, in a voice broken with tears. Then their Mother came to ask if they would like to go for a walk with her.

“Not to-day, Mother.”

In fact, they were afraid of their mother, and they were angry because she did not tell them that she was sending Miss Mann away. It suited their mood better to be by themselves. They fluttered about the room like caged swallows, crushed by the atmosphere of falsehood and silence. They wondered if they could not go to Miss Mann and ask her what was the matter; tell her they wanted her to stay, that they thought Mother had been horribly unfair. But they were afraid of distressing her. Besides they were ashamed, for how could they say a word about the matter when all they knew had been learned by eavesdropping? They had to spend the interminable afternoon by themselves, moping, crying from time to time, and turning over in their minds memories of what they had heard through the closed door—their mother’s heartless anger and Miss Mann’s despairing sobs.

In the evening, the governess came to see them, but only to say good night. As she left the room, the girls longed to break the silence, but could not utter a word. At the door, as if recalled by their dumb yearning, Miss Mann turned back, her eyes shining with emotion. She embraced both the girls, who instantly burst out crying. Kissing them once more, the governess hurried away.

It was obvious to the children that this was a final leave taking.

“We shall never see her again,” sobbed one.

“I know. She’ll be gone when we come back from school tomorrow.”

“Perhaps we shall be able to visit her after a time. Then she’ll show us the baby.”

“Yes, she’s always such a dear.”

“Poor Miss Mann!”

The sorrowful phrase seemed to hold a foreboding of their own destiny.

“I can’t think how we shall get on without her!”

“I shall never be able to stand another governess, after her.”

“Nor shall I.”

“There’ll never be anyone like Miss Mann. Besides...”

She did not venture to finish her sentence. An unconscious womanliness had made them feel a sort of veneration for Miss Mann, ever since they had known she had a baby. This was continually in their thoughts, and moved them profoundly.

“I say,” said one.

“Yes?”

“I’ve got an idea. Can’t we do something really nice for Miss Mann before she goes away, something that will show her how fond we are of her, and that we are not like Mother? Will you join in?”

“Rather!”

“You know how much she likes white roses. Let’s go out early tomorrow and buy some, before we go to school. We’ll put them in her room.”

“But when?”

“After school.”

“That’s no use, she’ll be gone then. Look here, I’ll steal out quite early, before breakfast, and bring them back here. Then we’ll take them to her.”

“All right, we must get up early.”

They raided their money-boxes. It made them almost cheerful, once more, that they would be able to show Miss Mann how much they loved her.

Early in the morning, roses in hand, they knocked at Miss Mann’s door. There was no answer.

Thinking the governess must be asleep, they peeped in. The room was empty; the bed had not been slept in. On the table lay two letters. The girls were startled. What had happened?

“I shall go straight to Mother,” said the elder girl. Defiantly, without a trace of fear, she accosted her mother with the words:

“Where’s Miss Mann?”

“In her room, I suppose.”

“There’s no one in her room; she never went to bed. She must have gone away last night. Why didn’t you tell us anything about it?”

The mother hardly noticed the challenging tone. Turning pale, she sought her husband, who went into Miss Mann’s room.

He stayed there some time, while the girls eyed their mother with gloomy indignation, and she seemed unable to meet their gaze.

Now their father came back, with an open letter in his hand. He, too, was agitated. The parents retired into their own room, and conversed in low tones. This time, the girls were afraid to try and overhear what was said. They had never seen their father look like that before.

When their mother came out, they saw she had been weeping. They wanted to question her, but she said sharply:

“Be off with you to school, you’ll be late.”

They had to go. For hours they sat in class without attending to a single word. Then they rushed home. There, a dreadful thought seemed to dominate everyone’s mind. Even the servants had a strange look. Their mother came to meet them, and began to speak in carefully rehearsed phrases:

“Children, you won’t see Miss Mann any more; she is...”

The sentence was left unfinished. So furious, so menacing, was the girls’ expression that their mother could not lie to them. She turned away, and sought refuge in her own room.

That afternoon, Otto put in an appearance. One of the two letters had been addressed to him, and he had been summoned. He too, was pale and uneasy. No one spoke to him. Everybody shunned him. Catching sight of the two girls sitting disconsolate in a corner of the room, he went up to them.

“Don’t you come near us!” both screamed, regarding him with horror.

He paced up and down for a while, and then vanished. No one spoke to the girls and they said nothing to one another. They wandered aimlessly from room to room, looking silently into one another’s tearstained faces when their paths crossed. They knew everything now. They knew that they had been cheated; they knew how mean people could be. They did not love their parents any more, did not trust Father or Mother any longer. They were sure they would never trust anyone again. All the burden of life pressed heavily upon their frail young shoulders. Their careless, happy childhood lay behind them; unknown terrors awaited them. The full significance of what had happened was still beyond their grasp, but they were wrestling with its dire potentialities., They were drawn together in their isolation, but it was a dumb communion, for they could not break the spell of silence. From their elders they were completely cut off. No one could approach them, for the portals of their souls had been closed—perhaps for years to come. They were at war with all around them. For, in one brief day, they had grown up!

Not till late in the evening, when they were alone in their bedroom, did there reawaken in them the child’s awe of solitude, the haunting fear of the dead woman, the terror of dread possibilities. It was bitterly cold; in the general confusion the heating apparatus had been forgotten They both crept into one bed, and cuddled closely together, for mutual encouragement as well as for warmth. They were still unable to discuss their trouble. But now, at length, the younger’s pent-up emotion found relief in a storm of tears, and the elder, too, sobbed convulsively. Thus they lay weeping in one another’s arms. They were no longer bewailing the loss of Miss Mann, or their estrangement from their parents. They were shaken by the anticipation of what might befall them in this unknown world into whose realities they had to-day looked for the first time. They shrank from the life into which they were growing up; from the life which seemed to them like a forest full of threatening shapes, a forest they had to cross. But by degrees this sense of anxiety grew visionary; their sobs were less violent, and came at longer intervals. They breathed quietly, now, in a rhythmical unison of peace. They slept.





LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN


R. the famous novelist, had been away on a brief holiday in the mountains. Reaching Vienna early in the morning, he bought a newspaper at the station, and when he glanced at the date was reminded that it was his birthday. “Forty-one!”—the thought came like a flash. He was neither glad nor sorry at the realization. He hailed a taxi, and skimmed the newspaper as he drove home. His man reported that there had been a few callers during the master’s absence, besides some telephone messages. A bundle of letters was awaiting him. Looking indifferently at these, he opened one or two because he was interested in the senders, but laid aside for the time a bulky packet addressed in a strange handwriting. At ease in an armchair, he drank his morning tea, finished the newspaper, and read a few circulars. Then, having lighted a cigar, he turned to the remaining letter.

It was a manuscript rather than an ordinary letter, comprising several dozen hastily penned sheets in a feminine handwriting. Involuntarily he examined the envelope once more, in case he might have overlooked a covering letter. But there was nothing of the kind, no signature, and no sender’s address on either envelope or contents.“Strange,” he thought, as he began to read the manuscript. The first words were a superscription:

“To you, who have never known me.” He was perplexed. Was this addressed to him, or to some imaginary being? His curiosity suddenly awakened he, read as follows:





My boy died yesterday. For three days and three nights I have been wrestling with Death for this frail little life. During forty consecutive hours, while the fever of influenza was shaking his poor burning body I sat beside his bed. I put cold compresses on his fore head; day and night, night and day. I held his restless little hands. The third evening,my strength gave out. My eyes closed without my being aware of it, and for three or four hours I must have slept on the hard stool. Meanwhile, Death took him. There he lies, my darling boy, in his narrow cot, just as he died. Only his eyes have been closed, his wise, dark eyes; and his hands have been crossed over his breast. Four candles are burning, one at each corner of the bed. I cannot bear to look, I cannot bear to move; for when the candles flicker, shadows chase one another over his face and his closed lips. It looks as if his features stirred, and I could almost fancy that he is not dead after all, that he will wake and with his clear voice will say something childishly loving. But I know that he is dead; and I will not look again, to hope once more, and once more to be disappointed. I know, now, my boy died yesterday. Now I have only you left in the world; only you, who do not know me; you, who are enjoying yourself all unheeding, sporting with men and things. Only you, who have never known me, and whom I have never ceased to love.

I have lighted a fifth candle, and am sitting at the table writing to you. I cannot stay alone with my dead child without pouring my heart out to someone; and to whom should I do that in this dreadful hour if not to you, who have been and still are all in all to me? Perhaps I shall not be able to make myself plain to you. Perhaps you will not be able to understand me. My head feels so heavy my temples are throbbing;my limbs are aching. I think I must be feverish. Influenza is raging in this quarter and probably I have caught the infection. I should not be sorry if I could join my child in that way, instead of making short work of myself. Sometimes it seems dark before my eyes, and perhaps I shall not be able to finish this letter; but I shall try with all my strength, this one and only time, to speak to you, my beloved, to you who have never known me.

To you only do I want to speak, that I may tell you everything for the first time. I should like you to know the whole of my life, of that life which has always been yours, and of which you have known nothing. But you shall only know my secret after I am dead, when there will be no one whom you will have to answer; you shall only know it if that which is now shaking my limbs with cold and with heat should really prove, for me, the end. If I have to go on living, I shall tear up this letter and shall keep the silence I have always kept. If you ever hold it in your hands, you may know that a dead woman is telling you her lifestory; the story of a life which was yours from its first to its last fully conscious hour. You need have no fear of my words. A dead woman wants nothing; neither love, nor compassion, nor consolation. I have only one thing to ask of you, that you believe to the full what the pain in me forces me to disclose to you. Believe my words, for I ask nothing more of you; a mother will not speak false beside the deathbed of her only child.

I am going to tell you my whole life, the life which did not really begin until the day I first saw you. What I can recall before that day is gloomy and confused, a memory as of a cellar filled with dusty, dull and cob-webbed things and people—a place with which my heart has no concern. When you came into my life, I was thirteen, and I lived in the house where you live to-day, in the very house in which you are reading this letter; the last breath of my life. I lived on the same floor, for the door of our flat was just opposite the door of yours. You will certainly have forgotten us. You will long ago have forgotten the accountant’s widow in her threadbare mourning, and the thin, half-grown girl. We were always so quiet, characteristic examples of shabby gentility. It is unlikely that you ever heard our name, for we had no plate on our front door, and no one ever came to see us. Besides, it is so long ago, fifteen or sixteen years. Impossible that you should remember. But I, how passionately I remember every detail. As if it had just happened, I recall the day, the hour, when I first heard of you, first saw you. How could it be otherwise, seeing that it was then the world began for me? Have patience awhile, and let me tell you everything from first to last. Do not grow weary of listening to me for a brief space, since I have not been weary of loving you my whole life long.

Before you came, the people who lived in your flat were horrid folk, always quarrelling. Though they were wretchedly poor themselves, they hated us for our poverty because we held aloof from them. The man was given to drink, and used to beat his wife. We were often wakened in the night by the clatter of falling chairs and breaking plates. Once, when he had beaten her till the blood came, she ran out on the landing with her hair streaming, followed by her drunken husband abusing her, until all the people came out on to the staircase and threatened to send for the police. My mother would have nothing to do with them. She forbade me to play with the children, who took every opportunity of venting their spleen on me for this refusal. When they met me in the street, they would call me names; and once they threw a snowball at me which was so hard that it cut my forehead. Everyone in the house detested them, and we all breathed more freely when something happened and they had to leave—I think the man had been arrested for theft. For a few days there was a “To Let” notice at the the main door. Then it was taken down, and the caretaker told us that the flat had been rented by an author, who was a bachelor, and was sure to be quiet. That was the first time I heard your name.

A few days later, the flat was thoroughly cleaned, and the painters and decorators came. Of course they made lot of noise, but my mother was glad, for she said that would be the end of the disorder next door. I did not see you during the move. The decorations and furnishings were supervised by your servant, the little greyhaired man with such a serious demeanour, who had obviously been used to service in good families. He managed everything in a most businesslike way, and impressed us all very much. A high-class domestic of this kind was something quite new in our suburban flats. Besides, he was extremely civil, but was never hail-fellow-well-met with the ordinary servants. From the outset he treated my mother respectfully, as a lady; and he was always courteous even to little me. When he had occasion to mention your name, he did so in a way which showed that his feeling towards you was that of a family retainer. I used to love good old John for this, though I envied him at the same time because it was his privilege to see you constantly and to serve you.

Do you know why I am telling you these trifles? I Want you to understand how it was that from the very beginning your personality came to exercise so much power over me when I was still a shy and timid child. Before I had actually seen you, there was a halo round your head. You were enveloped in an atmosphere of wealth, marvel and mystery. People whose lives are narrow, are avid of novelty; and in this little suburban house we were all impatiently awaiting your arrival. In my own case, curiosity rose to fever point when I came home from school one afternoon and found the furniture van in front of the house. Most of the heavy things had gone up, and the furniture removers were dealing with the smaller articles. I stood at the door to watch and admire, for everything belonging to you was so different from what I had been used to. There were Indian idols, Italian sculptures, and great, brightly-coloured pictures. Last of all came books, such lovely books, many more than I should have thought possible. They were piled by the door. The manservant stood there carefully dusting them one by one. I greedily watched the pile as it grew. Your servant did not send me away, but he did not encourage me either, so I was afraid to touch any of them, though I should have so liked to stroke the smooth leather bindings. I did glance timidly at some of the titles; many of them were in French and in English, and in languages of which I did not know a single word. I should have liked to stand there watching for hours, but my mother called me and I had to go in.

I thought about you the whole evening, although I had not seen you yet. I had only about a dozen cheap books, bound in worn cardboard. I loved them more than anything else in the world, and was continually reading and re-reading them. Now I was wondering what the man could be like who had such a lot of books, who had read so much, who knew so many languages, who was rich and at the same time so learned. The idea of so many books aroused a kind of unearthly veneration. I tried to picture you in my mind. You must be an old man with spectacles and a long, white beard, like our geography master, but much kinder, nicer-looking, and gentler. I don’t know why I was sure that you must be handsome, for I fancied you to be an elderly man. That very night, I dreamed of you for the first time.

Next day you moved in; but though I was on the watch I could not get a glimpse of your face, and my failure inflamed my curiosity. At length I saw you, on the third day. How astounded I was to find that you were quite different from the ancient godfather conjured up by my childish imagination. A bespectacled, good-natured old fellow was what I had anticipated; and you came looking just as you still look, for you are one on whom the years leave little mark. You were wearing a beautiful suit of light-brown tweeds, and you ran upstairs two steps at a time with the boyish ease that always characterizes your movements. You were hat in hand, so that, with indescribable amazement, I should see your bright and lively face and your youthful hair. Your handsome, slim, and spruce figure was a positive shock to me. How strange it was that in this first moment I should have plainly realized that which I and all others are continually surprised at in you. I realized that you are two people rolled into one: that you are an ardent, lighthearted youth devoted to sport and adventure; and at the same time, in your art, a deeply read and highly cultured man, grave, and with a keen sense of responsibility. Unconsciously I perceived what everyone who knew you came to perceive, that you led two lives. One of these was known to all, it was the life open to the whole world; the other was turned away from the world, and was fully known only to yourself. I, a girl of thirteen, coming under the spell of your attraction, grasped this secret of your existence, this profound cleavage of your two lives, at the first glance.

Can you understand, now, what a miracle, what an alluring enigma, you must have seemed to me, the child? Here was a man whom everyone spoke of with respect because he wrote books, and because he was famous in the great world. Of a sudden he had revealed himself to me as a boyish, cheerful young man of five-and-twenty. I need hardly tell you that henceforward in my restricted world, you were the only thing that interested me; that my life revolved round yours with the fidelity proper to a girl of thirteen. I watched you, watched your habits, watched the people who came to see you—and all this increased instead of diminishing my interest in your personality, for the two-sidedness of your nature was reflected in the diversity of your visitors. Some of them were young men, comrades of yours, carelessly dressed students with whom you laughed and larked. Some of them were ladies who came in motors. Once the conductor of the opera—the great man whom before this I had seen only from a distance, baton in hand-called on you. Some of them were girls, young girls still attending the commercial school, who shyly glided in at the door. A great many of your visitors were women. I thought nothing of this, not even when, one morning,as I was on my way to school, I saw a closely veiled lady coming away from your flat. I was only just thirteen, and in my immaturity I did not in the least realize that the eager curiosity with which I scanned all your doings was already love.

But I know the very day and hour when I consciously gave my whole heart to you. I had been for a walk with a schoolfellow, and we were standing at the door chattering. A motor drove up. You jumped out, in the impatient, springy fashion which has never ceased to charm me, and were about to go in. An impulse made me open the door for you, and this brought me in your path, so that we almost collided. You looked at me with a cordial, gracious, all-embracing glance, which was almost a caress. You smiled at me tenderly—yes, tenderly is the word—and said gently, nay, confidentially: “Thanks so much.”

That was all. But from this moment, from the time when you looked at me so tenderly, so tenderly, I was yours. Later, before long indeed, I was to learn that this was a way you had of looking at all women with whom you came in contact. It was a caressive and alluring glance, at once enfolding and disclothing, the glance of the born seducer. Involuntarily you looked in this way at every shopgirl who served you, at every maidservant who opened the door to you. It was not that you consciously longed to possess all these women, but your impulse towards the sex unconsciously made your eyes melting and warm whenever they rested on a woman. At thirteen, I had no thought of this; and I felt as if I had been bathed in fire. I believed that the tenderness was for me, for me only; and in this one instant the woman was awakened in the half-grown girl, the woman who was to be yours for all future time.

“Who was that?” asked my friend. At first, I could not answer. I found it impossible to utter your name. It had suddenly become sacred to me, had become my secret. “Oh, it’s just someone who lives in the house,” I said awkwardly. “Then why did you blush so fiery red when he looked at you?” inquired my school fellow with the malice of an inquisitive child. I felt that she was making fun of me, and was reaching out towards my secret, and this coloured my cheeks more than ever. I was deliberately rude to her: “You silly idiot,” I said angrily—I should have liked to throttle her. She laughed mockingly, until the tears came into my eyes from impotent rage. I left her at the door and ran upstairs.

I have loved you ever since. I know full well that you are used to hearing women say that they love you. But I am sure that no one else has ever loved you so slavishly, with such doglike fidelity, with such devotion, as I did and do. Nothing can equal the unnoticed love of a child. It is hopeless and subservient; it is patient and passionate;it is something which the covetous love of a grown woman, the love that is unconsciously exacting can never be. None but lonely children can cherish such a passion. The others will squander their feelings in companionship, will dissipate them in confidential talks. They have heard and read much of love, and they know that it comes to all. They play with it like a toy; they flaunt it as a boy flaunts his first cigarette. But I had no confidant; I had been neither taught nor warned, I was inexperienced and unsuspecting. I rushed to meet my fate. Everything that stirred in me, all that happened to me, seemed to be centred upon you, upon my imaginings of you. My father had died long before. My mother could think of nothing but her troubles, of the difficulties of making ends meet upon her narrow pension, so that she had little in common with a growing girl. My school fellows, half-enlightened and half-corrupted, were uncongenial to me because of their frivolous outlook upon that which to me was a supreme passion. The upshot was that everything which surged up in me, all which in other girls of my age is usually scattered, was focused upon you. You became for me—what simile can do justice to my feelings? You became for me the whole of my life. Nothing existed for me except in so far as it related to you. Nothing had meaning for me unless it bore upon you in some way. You had changed everything for me. Hitherto I had been indifferent at school, and undistinguished. Now, of a sudden, I was the first. I read book upon book, far into the night, for I knew that you were a booklover. To my mother’s astonishment, I began, almost stubbornly, to practise the piano, for I fancied that you were fond of music. I stitched and mended my clothes, to make them neat for your eyes. It was a torment to me that there was a square patch in my old school-apron (cut down from one of my mother’s overalls). I was afraid you might notice it and would despise me, so I used to cover the patch with my satchel when I was on the staircase. I was terrified lest you should catch sight of it. What a fool I was! You hardly ever looked at me again.

Yet my days were spent in waiting for you and watching you. There was a judas in our front door, and through this a glimpse of your door could be had. Don’t laugh at me, dear. Even now, I am not ashamed of the hours I spent at this spy-hole. The hall was icy cold, and I was afraid of exciting my mother’s suspicions. But there I would watch through the long afternoons, during those months and years, book in hand, tense as a violin string, and vibrating at the touch of your nearness. I was ever near you, and ever tense; but you were no more aware of it than you were aware of the tension of the main spring of the watch in your pocket, faithfully recording the hours for you, accompanying your footsteps with its unheard ticking and vouchsafed only a hasty glance for one second among millions. I knew all about you, your habits, the neckties you wore; I knew each one of your suits. Soon I was familiar with your regular visitors, and had my likes and dislikes among them. From my thirteenth to my sixteenth year, my every hour was yours. What follies did I not commit? I kissed the door-handle you had touched; I picked up a cigarette-end you had thrown away, and it was sacred to me because your lips had pressed it. A hundred times, in the evening, on one pretext or another, I ran out into the street in order to see in which room your light was burning, that I might be more fully conscious of your invisible presence. During the weeks when you were away (my heart always seemed to stop beating when I saw John carry your portmanteau downstairs), life was devoid of meaning. Out of sorts, bored to death, and in an ill-humour, I wandered about not knowing what to do, and had to take precautions lest my tear-dimmed eyes should betray my despair to my mother.

I know that what I am writing here is a record of grotesque absurdities, of a girl’s extravagant fantasies. I ought to be ashamed of them; but I am not ashamed, for never was my love purer and more passionate than at this time. I could spend hours, days, in telling you how I lived with you though you hardly knew me by sight. Of course you hardly knew me, for if I met you on the stairs and could not avoid the encounter, I would hasten by with lowered head, afraid of your burning glance, hasten like one who is jumping into the water to avoid being singed. For hours, days, I could tell you of those years you have long since forgotten; could unroll all the calendar of your life: but I will not weary you with details. Only one more thing I should like to tell you dating from this time, the most splendid experience of my childhood. You must not laugh at it, for, trifle though you may deem it, to me it was of infinite significance.

It must have been a Sunday. You were away, and your man was dragging back the heavy rugs, which he had been beating, through the open door of the flat. They were rather too much for his strength, and I summoned up courage to ask whether he would let me help him. He was surprised, but did not refuse. Can I ever make you understand the awe, the pious veneration, with which I set foot in your dwelling, with which I saw your world—the writing-table at which you were accustomed to sit (there were some flowers on it in a blue crystal vase), the pictures, the books? I had no more than a stolen glance, though the good John would no doubt have let me see more had I ventured to ask him. But it was enough for me to absorb the atmosphere, and to provide fresh nourishment for my endless dreams of you in waking and sleeping.

This swift minute was the happiest of my childhood. I wanted to tell you of it, so that you who do not know me might at length begin to understand how my life hung upon yours. I wanted to tell you of that minute, and also of the dreadful hour which so soon followed. As I have explained, my thoughts of you had made me oblivious to all else. I paid no attention to my mother’s doings, or to those of any of our visitors. I failed to notice that an elderly gentleman, an Innsbruck merchant, a distant family connection of my mother, came often and stayed for a long time. I was glad that he took mother to the theatre sometimes, for this left me alone, undisturbed in my thoughts of you, undisturbed in the watching which was my chief, my only pleasure. But one day my mother summoned me with a certain formality, saying that she had something serious to talk to me about. I turned pale, and felt my heart throb. Did she suspect anything? Had I betrayed myself in some way? My first thought was of you, of my secret, of that which linked me with life. But my mother was herself embarrassed. It had never been her way to kiss me. Now she kissed me affectionately more than once, drew me to her on the sofa, and began hesitatingly and rather shamefacedly to tell me that her relative, who was a widower, had made her a proposal of marriage, and that, mainly for my sake, she had decided to accept. I palpitated with anxiety, having only one thought, that of you. “We shall stay here, shan’t we?” I stammered out. “No, we are going to Innsbruck, where Ferdinand has a fine villa.” I heard no more. Everything seemed to turn black before my eyes. I learned afterwards that I had fainted. I clasped my hands convulsively, and fell like a lump of lead. I cannot tell you all that happened in the next few days; how I, a powerless child, vainly revolted against the mighty elders. Even now, as I think of it, my hand shakes so that I can scarcely write. I could not disclose the real secret, and therefore my opposition seemed ill-tempered obstinacy. No one told me anything more. All the arrangements were made behind my back. The hours when I was at school were turned to account. Each time came home some new article had been removed or sold. My life seemed falling to pieces; and at last one day, when I returned to dinner, the furniture removers had cleared the flat. In the empty rooms there were some packed trunks, and two camp-beds for Mother and myself. We were to sleep there one night more, and were then to go to Innsbruck.

On this last day I suddenly made up my mind that I could not live without being near you. You were all the world to me. It is difficult to say what I was thinking of and whether in this hour of despair I was able to think at all. My mother was out of the house. I stood up, just as I was, in my school dress, and went over to your door. Yet I can hardly say that I went. With stiff limbs and trembling joints, I seemed to be drawn towards your door as by a magnet. It was in my mind to throw myself at your feet, and to beg you to keep me as a maid, as a slave. I cannot help feeling afraid that you will laugh at this infatuation of a girl of fifteen. But you would not laugh if you could realize how I stood there on the chilly landing, rigid with apprehension, and yet drawn onward by an irresistible force; how my arm seemed to lift itself in spite of me. The struggle appeared to last for endless, terrible seconds;and then I rang the bell. The shrill noise still sounds in my ears. It was followed by a silence in which my heart well-nigh stopped beating, and my blood stagnated, while I listened for your coming.

But you did not come. No one came. You must have been out that afternoon, and John must have been away too. With the dead note of the bell still sounding in my ears, I stole back into our empty dwelling, and threw myself exhausted upon a rug, tired out by these few paces as if I had been wading through deep snow for hours. Yet beneath this exhaustion there still glowed the determination to see you, to speak to you, before they carried me away. I can assure you that there were no sensual longings in my mind; I was still ignorant, just because I never thought of anything but you. All I wanted was to see you once more, to cling to you. Throughout that dreadful night I waited for you. Directly my mother had gone to sleep, I crept into the hall to listen for your return. It was a bitterly cold night in January. I was tired, my limbs ached, and there was no longer a chair on which I could sit; so I lay upon the floor, scourged by the draught that came under the door. In my thin dress I lay there, without any covering. I did not want to be warm, lest I should fall asleep and miss your footstep. Cramps seized me, so cold was it in the horrible darkness; again and again I had to stand up. But I waited, waited, waited for you, as for my fate.

At length (it must have been two or three in the morning) I heard the house-door open, and footsteps on the stair. The sense of cold vanished, and a rush of heat passed over me. I softly opened the door, meaning to run out, to throw myself at your feet....I cannot tell what I should have done in my frenzy. The steps drew nearer. A candle flickered. Tremblingly I held the door-handle. Was it you coming up the stairs?

Yes, it was you, beloved; but you were not alone. I heard a gentle laugh, the rustle of silk, and your voice, speaking in low tones. There was a woman with you....

I cannot tell how I lived through the rest of the night. At eight next morning, they took me with them to Innsbruck. I had no strength left to resist.





My boy died last night. I shall be alone once more, if I really have to go on living. To-morrow, strange men will come, black-clad and uncouth, bringing with them a coffin for the body of my only child. Perhaps friends will come as well, with wreaths—but what is the flowers on a coffin? They will offer consolation in one phrase or another. Words, words, words! What can words help? All I know is that I shall be alone again. There is nothing more terrible than to be alone among. human beings. That is what I came to realize during those interminable two years in Innsbruck, from my sixteenth to my eighteenth year, when I lived with people as a prisoner and an outcast. My stepfather, a quiet, taciturn man, was kind to me. My mother as if eager to atone for an unwitting injustice, seemed ready to meet all my wishes. Those of my own age would have been glad to befriend me. But I repelled their advances with angry defiance. I did not wish to be happy, I did not wish to live content away from you; so I buried myself in a gloomy world of self-torment and solitude. I would not wear the new and gay dresses they bought for me. I refused to go to concerts or to the theatre, and I would not take part in cheerful excursions. I rarely left the house. Can you believe me when I tell you that I hardly got to know a dozen streets in this little town where I lived for two years? Mourning was my joy; I renounced society and every pleasure, and was intoxicated with delight at the mortification I thus super added to the lack of seeing you. Moreover, I would let nothing divert me from my passionate longing to live only for you. Sitting alone at home, hour after hour and day after day, I did nothing but think of you, turning over in my mind unceasingly my hundred petty memories of you, renewing every movement and every time of waiting, rehearsing these episodes in the theatre of my mind. The countless repetitions of the years of my childhood from the day in which you came into my life have so branded the details on my memory that I can recall every minute of those long-passed years as if they were yesterday.

Thus my life was still entirely centred in you. I bought all your books. If your name was mentioned in the newspaper the day was a red-letter day. Will you believe me when I tell you that I have read your books so often that I know them by heart? Were anyone to wake me in the night and quote a detached sentence, I could continue the passage unfalteringly even to-day, after thirteen years. Your every word was Holy Writ to me. The world existed for me only in relationship to you. In the Viennese newspapers I read the reports of concerts and first nights, wondering which would interest you most. When evening came, I accompanied you in imagination, saying to myself: “Now he is entering the hall; now he is taking his seat.” Such were my fancies a thousand times, simply because I had once seen you at a concert.

Why should I recount these things? Why recount the tragic hopelessness of a forsaken child? Why tell it to you, who have never dreamed of my admiration or of my sorrow? But was I still a child? I was seventeen; I was eighteen; young fellows would turn to look after me in the street, but they only made me angry. To love anyone but you, even to play with the thought of loving anyone but you, would have been so utterly impossible to me, that the mere tender of affection on the part of another man seemed to me a crime. My passion for you remained just as intense, but it changed in character as my body grew and my senses awakened, becoming more ardent, more physical, more unmistakably the love of a grown woman. What had been hidden from the thoughts of the uninstructed child, of the girl who had rung your doorbell, was now my only longing. I wanted to give myself to you.

My associates believed me to be shy and timid. But I had an absolute fixity of purpose. My whole being was directed towards one end—back to Vienna, back to you. I fought successfully to get my own way, unreasonable, incomprehensible though it seemed to others. My step father was well-to-do, and looked upon me as his daughter. I insisted, however, that I would earn my own living, and at length got him to agree to my returning to Vienna as employee in a dressmaking establishment belonging to a relative of his.

Need I tell you whither my steps first led me that fog autumn evening when, at last, at last, I found myself back in Vienna? I left my trunk in the cloak-room, and hurried to a tram. How slowly it moved! Every stop was a renewed vexation to me. In the end, I reached the house. My heart leapt when I saw a light in your window. The town, which had seemed so alien, so dreary, grew suddenly alive for me. I myself lived once more, now that I was near you, you who were my unending dream. When nothing but the thin, shining pane of glass was between you and my uplifted eyes, I could ignore the fact that in reality I was as far from your mind as if I had been separated by mountains and valleys and rivers. Enough that I could go on looking at your window. There was a light in it; that was your dwelling; you were there; that was my world. For two years I had dreamed of this hour, and now it had come. Throughout that warm and cloudy evening I stood in front of your windows, until the light was extinguished. Not until then did I seek my own quarters.

Evening after evening I returned to the same spot.

Up to six o’clock I was at work. The work was hard, and yet I liked it, for the turmoil of the show-room masked the turmoil in my heart. The instant the shutters were rolled down, I flew to the beloved spot. To see you once more, to meet you just once, was all I wanted; simply from a distance to devour your face with my eyes. At length, after a week, I did meet you, and then the meeting took me by surprise. I was watching your window, when you came across the street. In an instant, I was a child once more, the girl of thirteen. My cheeks flushed. Although I was longing to meet your eyes, I hung my head and hurried past you as if someone had been in pursuit. Afterwards I was ashamed of having fled like a schoolgirl, for now I knew what I really wanted. I wanted to meet you; I wanted you to recognize me after all these weary years, to notice me, to love me.

For a long time you failed to notice me, although I took up my post outside your house every night, even when it was snowing, or when the keen wind of the Viennese winter was blowing. Sometimes I waited for hours in vain. Often, in the end, you would leave the house in the company of friends. Twice I saw you with a woman, and the fact that I was now awakened, that there was something new and different in my feeling towards you, was disclosed by the sudden heart-pang when I saw a strange woman walking confidently with you arm-in-arm. It was no surprise to me, for I had known since childhood how many such visitors came to your house; but now the sight aroused in me a definite bodily pain. I had a mingled feeling of enmity and desire when I witnessed this open manifestation of fleshly intimacy with another woman. For a day, animated by the youthful pride from which, perhaps, I am not yet free, I abstained from my usual visit; but how horrible was this empty evening of defiance and renunciation! The next night I was standing, as usual, in all humility, in front of your window; waiting, as I have ever waited, in front of your closed life.

At length came the hour when you noticed me. I marked your coming from a distance, and collected all my forces to prevent myself shrinking out of your path. As chance would have it, a loaded dray filled the street, so that you had to pass quite close to me. Involuntarily your eyes encountered my figure, and immediately, though you had hardly noticed the attentiveness in gaze, there came into your face that expression with which you were wont to look at women. The memory of it darted through me like an electric shock—that caressive and alluring glance, at once enfolding and disclothing, with which, years before, you had awakened the girl to become the woman and the lover. For a moment or two your eyes thus rested on me, for a space during which I could not turn my own eyes away, and then you had passed. My heart was beating so furiously that I had to slacken my pace; and when, moved by irresistible curiosity, I turned to look back, I saw that you were standing and watching me. The inquisitive interest of your expression convinced me that you had not recognized me. You did not recognize me, either then or later. How can I describe my disappointment? This was the first of such disappointments: the first time I had to endure what has always been my fate; that you have never recognized me. I must die, unrecognized. Ah, how can I make you understand my disappointment? During the years at Innsbruck I had never ceased to think of you. Our next meeting in Vienna was always in my thoughts. My fancies varied with my mood, ranging from the wildest possibilities to the most delightful. Every conceivable variation had passed through my mind. In gloomy moments it had seemed to me that you would repulse me, would despise me, for being of no account, for being plain, or importunate. I had had a vision of every possible form of disfavour, coldness, or indifference. But never, in the extremity of depression, in the utmost realization of my own insignificance, had I conceived this most abhorrent of possibilities—that you had never become aware of my existence. I understand, now (you have taught me!) that a girl’s or a woman’s face must be for a man something extraordinarily mutable. It is usually nothing more than the reflection of moods which pass as swiftly as an image vanishes from a mirror. A man can readily forget a woman’s face, because age modifies its lights and shades, and because at different times the dress gives it so different a setting. Resignation comes to a woman as her knowledge grows. But I, who was still a girl, was unable to understand your forgetfulness. My whole mind had been full of you ever since I had first known you, and this had produced in me the illusion that you must have often thought of me and waited for me. How could I have borne to go on living had I realized that I was nothing to you, that I had no place in your memory? Your glance that evening, showing me as it did that on your side there was not even : gossamer thread connecting your life with mine, meant for me a first plunge into reality, conveyed to me the first intimation of my destiny.

You did not recognize me. Two days later, when our paths again crossed, and you looked at me with an approach to intimacy, it was not in recognition of the girl who had loved you so long and whom you had awakened to womanhood; it was simply that you knew the face of the pretty lass of eighteen whom you had encountered at the same spot two evenings before. Your expression was one of friendly surprise, and a smile fluttered about your lips. You passed me as before, and as before you promptly slackened your pace. I trembled, I exulted, I longed for you to speak to me. I felt that for the first time I had become alive for you; I, too, walked slowly, and did not attempt to evade you. Suddenly, I heard your step behind me. Without turning round, I knew that I was about to hear your beloved voice directly addressing me. I was almost paralysed by the expectation, and my heart beat so violently that I thought I should have to stand still. You were at my side. You greeted me cordially, as if we were old acquaintances—though you did not really know me, though you have never known anything about my life. So simply charming was your manner that 1 was able to answer you without hesitation. We walked along the street and you asked me whether we could not have supper together. I agreed. What was there I could have refused you?

We supped in a little restaurant. You will not remember where it was. To you it will be one of many such. For what was I? One among hundreds; one adventure, one link in an endless chain. What happened that evening to keep me in your memory? I said very little, for I was so intensely happy to have you near me and to hear you speak to me. I did not wish to waste a moment upon questions or foolish words. I shall never cease to be thankful to you for that hour, for the way in which you justified my ardent admiration. I shall never forget the gentle tact you displayed. There was no undue eagerness, no hasty offer of a caress. Yet from the first moment you displayed so much friendly confidence, that you would have won me even if my whole being had not long ere this been yours. Can I make you understand how much it meant to me that my five years of expectation were so perfectly fulfilled?

The hour grew late, and we came away from the restaurant. At the door you asked me whether I was in any hurry, or still had time to spare. How could I hide from you that I was yours? I said I had plenty of time. With a momentary hesitation, you asked me whether I would not come to your rooms for a talk. “I shall be delighted,” I answered with alacrity, thus giving frank expression to my feelings. I could not fail to notice that my ready assent surprised you. I am not sure whether your feeling was one of vexation or pleasure, but it was obvious to me that you were surprised. To-day, of course, I understand your astonishment. I know now that it is usual for a woman, even though she may ardently desire to herself to a man, to feign reluctance, to simulate alarm in indignation. She must be brought to consent by urgent pleadings, by lies, adjurations, and promises. I know that only professional prostitutes are accustomed to answer such an invitation with a perfectly frank assent-prostitutes, or simple-minded, immature girls. How could you know that, in my case, the frank assent was but the voicing of an eternity of desire, the uprush of yearnings that had endured for a thousand days and more?

In any case, my manner aroused your attention; I had become interesting to you. As we were walking along together, I felt that during our conversation you were trying to sample me in some way. Your perceptions, your assured touch in the whole gamut of human emotions,made you realize instantly that there was something unusual here;that this pretty, complaisant girl carried a secret about with her. Your curiosity had been awakened, and your discreet questions showed that you were trying to pluck the heart out of my mystery. But my replies were evasive. I would rather seem a fool than disclose my secret to you.

We went up to your flat. Forgive me, beloved, for saying that you cannot possibly understand all that it meant to me to go up those stairs with you—how I was mad, tortured, almost suffocated with happiness. Even now I can hardly think of it without tears, but I have no tears left. Everything in that house had been steeped in my passion; everything was a symbol of my childhood and its longing. There was the door behind which a thousand times I had awaited your coming; the stairs on which I had heard your footsteps, and where I had first seen you; the judas through which I had watched your comings and goings; the doormat on which I had once knelt; the sound of a key in the lock, which had always been a signal to me. My childhood and its passions were nested within these few yards of space. Here was my whole life, and it surged around me like a great storm, for all was being fulfilled, and I was going with you, I with you, into your, into our house. Think (the way I am phrasing it sounds trivial, but I know no better words) that up to your door was the world of reality, the dull everyday world which had been that of all my previous life. At this door began the magic world of my childish imaginings. Aladdin’s realm. Think how a thousand times, I had had my burning eyes fixed upon this door through which I was now passing, my head in a whirl, and you will have an inkling—no more—of all that this tremendous minute meant to me.

I stayed with you that night. You did not dream that before you no man had ever touched or seen my body. How could you fancy it, when I made no resistance, and when I suppressed every trace of shame, fearing lest I might betray the secret of my love? That would certainly have alarmed you; you care only for what comes and goes easily, for that which is light of touch, is imponderable. You dread being involved in anyone else’s destiny. You like to give yourself freely to all the world but not to make any sacrifices. When I tell you that I gave myself to you as a maiden, do not misunderstand me. I am not making any charge against you. You did not entice me, deceive me, seduce me. I threw myself into your arms; went out to meet my fate. I have nothing but thankfulness towards you for the blessedness of that night. When I opened my eyes in the darkness and you were beside me, I felt that I must be in heaven, and I was amazed that the stars were not shining on me. Never, beloved, have I repented giving myself to you that night. When you were sleeping beside me, when I listened to your breathing, touched your body, and felt myself so near you, I shed tears for very happiness.

I went away early in the morning. I had to go to my work and I wanted to leave before your servant came. When I was ready to go, you put your arm round me and looked at me for a very long time. Was some obscure memory stirring in your mind; or was it simply that my radiant happiness made me seem beautiful to you? You kissed me on the lips, and I moved to go. You asked me: “Would you not like to take a few flowers with you?” There were four white roses in the blue crystal vase on the writing-table (I knew it of old from that stolen glance of childhood), and you gave them to me. For days they were mine to kiss.

We had arranged to meet on a second evening. Again it was full of wonder and delight. You gave me a third night. Then you said that you were called away from Vienna for a time—oh, how I had always hated those journeys of yours!—and promised that I should hear from you as soon as you came back. I would only give you a poste-restante address, and did not tell you my real name. I guarded my secret. Once more you gave me roses at parting—at parting.

Day after day for two months I asked myself...no, I will not describe the anguish of my expectation and despair. I make no complaint. I love you just as you are, ardent and forgetful, generous and unfaithful. I love you just as you have always been. You were back long before the two months were up. The light in your windows showed me that, but you did not write to me. In my last hours I have not a line in your handwriting, not a line from you to whom my life was given. I waited, waited despairingly. You did not call me to you, did not write a word, not a word....

My boy who died yesterday was yours too. He was your son, the child of one of those three nights. I was yours, and yours only from that time until the hour of his birth. I felt myself sanctified by your touch, and it would not have been possible for me then to accept any other man’s caresses. He was our boy, dear; the child of my fully conscious love and of your careless, spendthrift, almost unwitting tenderness. Our child, our son, our only child. Perhaps you will be startled, perhaps merely surprised. You will wonder why I never told you of this boy; and why, having kept silence throughout the long years, I only tell you of him now, when he lies in his last sleep, about to leave me for all time—never, never to return. How could I have told you? I was a stranger, a girl who had shown herself only too eager to spend those three nights with you. Never would you have believed that I, the nameless partner in a chance encounter, had been faithful to you, the unfaithful. You would never without misgivings, have accepted the boy as your own. Even if, to all appearance, you had trusted my word, you would still have cherished the secret suspicion that I had seized an opportunity of fathering upon you, a man of means, the child of another lover. You would have been suspicious. There would always have been a shadow of mistrust between you and me. I could not have borne it. Besides, I know you. Perhaps I know you better than you know yourself. You love to be care-free, light of heart, perfectly at ease; and that is what you understand by love. It would have been repugnant to you to find yourself suddenly in the position of father; to be made responsible, all at once, for a child’s destiny. The breath of freedom is the breath of life to you, and you would have felt me to be a tie. Inwardly, even in defiance of your conscious will, you would have hated me as an embodied claim. Perhaps only now and again, for an hour or for a fleeting minute, should I have seemed a burden to you, should I have been hated by you. But it was my pride that I should never be a trouble or a care to you all my life long. I would rather take the whole burden on myself than be a burden to you; I wanted to be the one among all the women you had intimately known of whom you would never think except with love and thankfulness. In actual fact, you never thought of me at all. You forgot me.

I am not accusing you. Believe me, I am not coming. You must forgive me if for a moment, now and again, it seems as if my pen had been dipped in gall. You must forgive me; for my boy, our boy, lies dead there beneath the flickering candles. I have clenched my fists against God, and have called him a murderer, for I have been almost beside myself with grief. Forgive me for complaining. I know that you are kindhearted, and always ready to help. You will help the merest stranger at a word. But your kindliness is peculiar. It is unbounded. Anyone may have of yours as much as he can grasp with both hands. And yet, I must own, your kindliness works sluggishly. You need to be asked. You help those who call for help; you help from shame, from weakness, and not from sheer joy in helping. Let me tell you openly that those who are in affliction and torment are not dearer to you than your brothers in happiness. Now, it is hard, very hard, to ask anything of such as you, even of the kindest among you. Once, when I was still a child, I watched through the judas in our door how you gave something to a beggar who had rung your bell. You gave quickly and freely, almost before he spoke. But there was a certain nervousness and haste in your manner, as if your chief concern were to be speedily rid of him; you seemed to be afraid to meet his eye. I have never forgotten this uneasy and timid way of giving help, this shunning of a word of thanks. That is why I never turned to you in my difficulty. Oh, I know that you would have given me all the help I needed, in spite of a doubt that my child was yours. You would have offered me comfort, and have given me money, an ample supply of money; but always with a masked impatience, a secret desire to shake off trouble. I even believe that you would have advised me to rid myself of the coming child. This was what I dreaded above all, for I knew that I should do whatever you wanted. But the child was all in all to me. It was yours; it was you reborn—not the happy and carefree you, whom I could never hope to keep; but you, given to me for my very own, flesh of my flesh, intimately intertwined with my own life. At length I held you fast; I could feel your life-blood flowing through my veins; I could nourish you, caress you, kiss you, as often as my soul yearned. That was why I was so happy when I knew that I was with child by you and that is why I kept the secret from you. Hence forward you could not escape me; you were mine.

But you must not suppose that the months of waiting passed so happily as I had dreamed in my first transports. They were full of sorrow and care, full of loathing for the baseness of mankind. Things went hard with me. I could not stay at work during the later months, for my stepfather’s relatives would have noticed my condition, and would have sent the news home. Nor would I ask my mother for money; so until my time came I managed to live by the sale of some trinkets. A week before my confinement, the few crown-pieces that remained to me were stolen by my laundress, so I had to go to the maternity hospital. The child, your son, was born there, in that asylum of wretchedness, among the very poor, the outcast, and the abandoned. It was a deadly place. Everything was strange, was alien. We were all alien to one another, as we lay there in our loneliness, filled with mutual hatred, thrust together only by our kinship of poverty and distress into this crowded ward, reeking of chloroform and blood, filled with cries and moaning. A patient in these wards loses all individuality, except such as remains in the name at the head of the clinical record. What lies in the bed is merely a piece of quivering flesh, an object of study....

I ask your forgiveness for speaking of these things. I shall never speak of them again. For eleven years I have kept silence, and shall soon be dumb for evermore. Once, at least, I had to cry aloud, to let you know how dearly bought was this child, this boy who was my delight, and who now lies dead. I had forgotten those dreadful hours, forgotten them in his smiles and his voice, forgotten them in my happiness. Now, when he is dead, the torment has come to life again; and I had, this once, to give it utterance. But I do not accuse you; only God, only God who is the author of such purposeless affliction. Never have I cherished an angry thought of you. Not even in the utmost agony of giving birth did I feel any resentment against you; never did I repent the nights when I enjoyed your love; never did I cease to love you or to bless the hour when you came into my life. Were it necessary for me, fully aware of what was coming, to relive that time in hell, I would do it gladly, not once, but many times.

Our boy died yesterday, and you never knew him. His bright little personality has never come into the most fugitive contact with you, and your eyes have never rested on him. For a long time after our son was born, I kept myself hidden from you. My longing for you had become less overpowering. Indeed, I believe I loved you less passionately. Certainly, my love for you did not hurt so much, now that I had the boy. I did not wish to divide myself between you and him, and so I did not give myself to you, who were happy and independent of me, but to the boy who needed me, whom I had to nourish, whom I could kiss and fondle. I seemed to have been healed of my restless yearning for you. The doom seemed to have been lifted from me by the birth of this other you, who was truly my own. Rarely, now, did my feelings reach out towards you in your dwelling. One thing only—on your birthday I have always sent you a bunch of white roses, like the roses you gay after our first night of love. Has it ever occurred to you, during these ten or eleven years, to ask yourself who sent them? Have you ever recalled having given such roses to a girl? I do not know, and never shall know. For me it was enough to send them to you out of the darkness; enough, once a year, to revive my own memory of that hour.

You never knew our boy. I blame myself to-day for having hidden him from you, for you would have loved him. You have never seen him smile when he first opened his eyes after sleep, his dark eyes that were your eyes, the eyes with which he looked merrily forth at me and the world. He was so bright, so lovable. All your lightheartedness and your mobile imagination were his likewise—in the form in which these qualities can show themselves in a child. He would spend entranced hours playing with things as you play with life; and then, grown serious, would sit long over his books. He was you, reborn. The mingling of sport and earnest, which is so characteristic of you, was becoming plain in him; and the more he resembled you, the more I loved him. He was good at his lessons, so that he could chatter French like a magpie. His exercise books were the tidiest in the class. And what a fine, upstanding little man he was! When I took him to the seaside in the summer, at Grado, women used to stop and stroke his fair hair. At Semmering, when he was tobogganing, people would turn round to gaze after him. He was so handsome, so gentle, so appealing. Last year, when he went to college as a boarder, he began to wear the collegiates’ uniform of an eighteenth-century page, with a little dagger stuck in his belt—now he lies here in his shift, with pallid lips and crossed hands.

You will wonder how I could manage to give the boy so costly an upbringing, how it was possible for me to provide for him an entry into this bright and cheerful life of the well-to-do. Dear one, I am speaking to you from the darkness. Unashamed, I will tell you. Do not shrink from me. I sold myself. I did not become a streetwalker, a common prostitute, but I sold myself. My friends, my lovers, were wealthy men. At first I sought them out, but soon they sought me, for I was (did you ever notice it?) a beautiful woman. Everyone to whom I gave myself was devoted to me. They all became my grateful admirers. They all loved me—except you, except you whom I loved.

Will you despise me now that I have told you what I did? I am sure you will not. I know you will understand everything, will understand that what I did was done only for you, for your other self, for your boy. In the lying-in hospital I had tasted the full horror of poverty. I knew that, in the world of the poor, those who are downtrodden are always the victims. I could not bear to think that your son, your lovely boy, was to grow up in that abyss, amid the corruptions of the street, in the poisoned air of a slum. His delicate lips must not learn the speech of the gutter; his fine, white skin must not be chafed by the harsh and sordid underclothing of the poor. Your son must have the best of everything, all the wealth and all the lightheartedness of the world. He must follow your footsteps through life, must dwell in the sphere in which you had lived.

That is why I sold myself. It was no sacrifice to me, for what are conventionally termed “Honour” and “Disgrace” were unmeaning words to me. You were the only one to whom my body could belong, and you did not love me, so what did it matter what I did with that body? My companions’ caresses, even their most ardent passion, never sounded my depths, although many of them were persons I could not but respect, and although the thought of my own fate made me sympathize with them in their unrequited love. All these men were kind to me; they all petted and spoiled me; they all paid me every deference.One of them, a widower, an elderly man of title, used his utmost influence until he secured your boy’s nomination to the college. This man loved me like a daughter. Three or four times he urged me to marry him. I could have been a countess to-day, mistress of a lovely castle m Tyrol. I could have been free from care, for the boy would have had a most affectionate father and I should have had a sedate, distinguished, and kind-hearted husband. But I persisted in my refusal though I knew it gave him pain. It may have been foolish of me. Had I yielded, I should have been living a safe and retired life somewhere, and my child would still have been with me. Why should I hide from you the reason for my refusal? I did not want to bind myself. I wanted to remain free—for you. In my innermost self in the unconscious, I continued to dream the dream of my childhood. Some day, perhaps you would call me to your side, were it only for an hour. For the possibility of this one hour I rejected everything else, simply that I might be free to answer your call. Since my first awakening to womanhood, what had my life been but waiting, a waiting upon your will?

In the end, the expected hour came. And still you never knew that it had come! When it came, you did not recognize me. You have never recognized me, never, never. I met you often enough, in theatres, at concerts, in the Prater, and elsewhere. Always my heart leapt but always you passed me by, unheeding. In outward appearance I had become a different person. The timid girl was a woman now; beautiful, it was said; decked out in fine clothes; surrounded by admirers. How could you recognize in me one whom you had known as a shy girl in the subdued light of your bedroom? Sometimes my companion would greet you, and you would acknowledge the greeting as you glanced at me. But your look was always that of a courteous stranger, a look of deference, but not of recognition—distant, hopelessly distant. Once, I remember, this non-recognition, familiar as it had become, was a torture to me. I was in a box at the opera with a friend, and you were in the next box. The lights were lowered when the Overture began. I could no longer see your face, but I could feel your breathing quite close to me, just as when I was with you in your room; and on the velvet-covered partition between the boxes your slender hand was resting. I was filled with an infinite longing to bend down and kiss this hand, whose loving touch I had once known. Amid the turmoil of sound from the orchestra, the craving grew even more intense. I had to hold myself in convulsively, to keep my lips away from your dear hand. At the end of the first act, I told my friend I wanted to leave. It was intolerable to me to have you sitting there beside me in the darkness, so near, and so estranged.

But the hour came once more, only once more. It was all but a year ago, on the day after your birthday. My thoughts had been dwelling on you more than ever, for I used to keep your birthday as a festival. Early in the morning I had gone to buy the white roses which I sent you every year in commemoration of an hour you had forgotten. In the afternoon I took my boy for a drive and we had tea together. In the evening we went to the theatre. I wanted him to look upon this day as a sort of mystical anniversary of his youth, though he could not know the reason. The next day I spent with my intimate of that epoch, a young and wealthy manufacturer of Brunn, with whom I had been living for two years. He was passionately fond of me, and he, too, wanted me to marry him. I refused, for no reason he could understand, although he loaded me and the child with presents, and was lovable enough in his rather stupid and slavish devotion. We went together to a concert, where we met a lively company. We all had supper at a restaurant in the Ringstrasse. Amid talk and laughter, I proposed that we should move on to a dancing-hall. In general, such places, where the cheerfulness is always an expression of partial intoxication, are repulsive to me, and I would seldom go to them. But on this occasion some elemental force seemed at work in me, leading to make the proposal, which was hailed with acclamation by the others. I was animated by an inexplicable longing, as if some extraordinary experience were awaiting me. As usual, everyone was eager to accede to my whims. We went to the dancing hall, drank some champagne, and I had a sudden access of almost frenzied cheerfulness such as I had never known. I drank one glass of wine after another, joined in the chorus of a suggestive song, and was in a mood to dance with glee. Then, all in a moment, I felt as if my heart had been seized by an icy or a burning hand. You were sitting with some friends at the next table, regarding me with an admiring and covetous glance, that glance which had always thrilled me beyond expression. For the first time in ten years you were looking at me again under the stress of all the unconscious passion in your nature. I trembled, and my hand shook so violently that I nearly let my wineglass fall. Fortunately my companions did not notice my condition, for their perceptions were confused by the noise of laughter and music.

Your look became continually more ardent, and touched my own senses to fire. I could not be sure whether you had at last recognized me, or whether your desires had been aroused by one whom you believed to be a stranger. My cheeks were flushed, and I talked at random. You could not help noticing the effect your glance had on me. You made an inconspicuous movement of the head, to suggest my coming into the ante-room for a moment. Then, having settled your bill, you took leave of your associates and left the table, after giving me a further sign that you intended to wait for me outside. I shook like one in the cold stage of a fever. I could no longer answer when spoken to, could no longer control the tumult of my blood. At this moment, as chance would have it, a couple of Negroes with clattering heels began a barbaric dance to the accompaniment of their own shrill cries. Everyone turned to look at them, and I seized my opportunity. Standing up, I told my friend that I would be back in a moment, and followed you.

You were waiting for me in the lobby, and your face lighted up when I came. With a smile on your lips, you hastened to meet me. It was plain that you did not recognize me, neither the child nor the girl of old days. Again, to you, I was a new acquaintance. “Have you really got an hour to spare for me?” you asked in a confident tone, which showed that you took me for one of the women whom anyone can buy for a night. “Yes,” I answered; the same tremulous but perfectly acquiescent“Yes” that you had heard from me in my girlhood, more than ten years earlier, in the darkling street. “Tell me when we can meet,” you said.“Whenever you like,” I replied, for I knew nothing of shame where you were concerned. You looked at me with a little surprise, with a surprise which had in it the same flavour of doubt mingled with curiosity which you had shown before when you were astonished at the readiness of my acceptance. “Now?” you inquired, after a moment’s hesitation. “Yes,” I replied, “let us go.”

I was about to fetch my wrap from the cloak-room, When I remembered that my Brunn friend had handed in our things together, and that he had the ticket. It was impossible to go back, and ask him for it, and it seemed to me even more impossible to renounce this hour with you to which I had been looking forward for years. My choice was instantly made. I gathered my shawl around and went forth into the misty night, regardless not only, of my cloak, but regardless, likewise, of the kind—hearted man with whom I had been living for years—regardless of the fact that in this public way, before his friends I was putting him into the ludicrous position of one whose mistress abandons him at the first nod of a stranger. Inwardly, I was well aware how basely and ungratefully I was behaving towards a good friend. I knew that my outrageous folly would alienate him from me for ever and that I was playing havoc with my life. But what was his friendship, what was my own life, to me when compared with the chance of again feeling your lips on mine of again listening to the tones of your voice. Now that all is over and done with I can tell you this, can let you know how I loved you. I believe that were you to summon me from my death-bed I should find strength to rise in answer to your call.

There was a taxi at the door, and we drove to your rooms. Once more I could listen to your voice, once more I felt the ecstasy of being near you, and was almost as intoxicated with joy and confusion as I had been so long before. I cannot describe it all to you, how what I had felt ten years earlier was now renewed as we went up the wellknown stairs together; how I lived simultaneously in the past and in the present, my whole being fused as it were with yours. In your rooms, little was changed. There were a few more pictures, a great many more books, one or two additions to your furniture—but the whole had the friendly look of an old acquaintance. On the writing-table was the vase with the roses—my roses, the ones I had sent you the day before as a memento of the woman whom you did not remember, whom you did not recognize, not even now when she was close to you, when you were holding her hand and your lips were pressed on hers. But it comforted me to see my flowers there, to know that you had cherished something that was an emanation from me, was the breath of my love for you.

You took me in your arms. Again I stayed with you for the whole of one glorious night. But even then you did not recognize me. While I thrilled to your caresses it was plain to me that your passion knew no difference between a loving mistress and a meretrix, that your spendthrift affections were wholly concentrated in their own expression. To me, the stranger picked up at a dancing-hall, you were at once affectionate and courteous. You would not treat me lightly, and yet you were full of an enthralling ardour. Dizzy with the old happiness, I was again aware of the two-sidedness of your nature, of that strange mingling of intellectual passion with sensual, which had already enslaved me to you in my childhood. In no other man have I ever known such complete surrender to the sweetness of the moment. No other has for the time being given himself so utterly as did you who, when the hour was past, were to relapse into an interminable and almost inhuman forgetfullness. But I, too, forgot myself. Who was I, lying in the darkness beside you? Was I the impassioned child of former days; was I the mother of your son; was I a stranger? Everything in this wonderful night was at one and the same time entrancingly familiar and entrancingly new. I prayed that the joy might last for ever.

But morning came. It was late when we rose, and you asked me to stay to breakfast. Over the tea, which an unseen hand had discreetly served in the dining-room, we talked quietly. As of old, you displayed a cordial frankness; and, as of old, there were no tactless questions, there was no curiosity about myself. You did not ask my name, nor where I lived. To you I was as before a casual adventure, a nameless woman, an ardent hour which leaves no trace when it is over. You told me that you were about to start on a long journey, that you were going to spend two or three months in northern Africa. The words broke in upon my happiness like a knell: “Past, past, past and forgotten!” I longed to throw myself at your feet, crying: “Take me with you, that you may at length come to know me, at length after all these years!” But I was timid, cowardly, slavish, weak. All I could say was: “What a pity!” You looked at me with a smile: “Are you really sorry?”

For a moment I was as if frenzied. I stood up and looked at you fixedly. Then I said: “The man I love has always gone on a journey.” I looked you straight in the eyes. “Now, now,” I thought, “Now he will recognize me!” You only smiled, and said consolingly: “One comes back after a time.” I answered: “Yes, one comes back, but one has forgotten by then.”

I must have spoken with strong feeling, for my tone moved you. You, too, rose, and looked at me wonderingly and tenderly. You put your hands on my shoulders:

“Good things are not forgotten, and I shall not forget you.” Your eyes studied me attentively, as if you wished to form an enduring image of me in your mind. When I felt this penetrating glance, this exploration of my whole being, I could not but fancy that the spell of your blindness would at last be broken. “He will recognize me! He will recognize me!”My soul trembled with expectation.

But you did not recognize me. No, you did not recognize me. Never had I been more of a stranger to you than I was at that moment, for had it been otherwise you could not possibly have done what you did a few minutes later. You had kissed me again, had kissed me passionately. My hair had been ruffled, and I had to tidy it once more. Standing at the glass, I saw in it—and as I saw, I was overcome with shame and horror—that you were surreptitiously slipping a couple of banknotes into my muff. I could hardly refrain from crying out; I could hardly refrain from slapping your face. You were paying me for the night I had spent with you, me who had loved you since childhood, me the mother of your son. To you I was only a prostitute picked up at a dancing hall. It was not enough that you should forget me; you had to pay me, and to debase me by doing so.

I hastily gathered up my belongings, that I might escape as quickly as possible; the pain was too great. I looked round for my hat. There it was, on the writing table, beside the vase with the white roses, my roses. I had an irresistible desire to make a last effort to awaken your memory. “Will you give me one of your white roses?”—“Of course,”you answered, lifting them all out of the vase. “But perhaps they were given you by a woman, a woman who loves you?”—“Maybe,” you replied, “I don’t know. They were a present, but I don’t know who sent them; that’s why I’m so fond of them.” I looked at you intently: “Perhaps they were sent you by a woman whom you have forgotten!”

You were surprised. I looked at you yet more intently. “Recognize me, only recognize me at last!” was the clamour of my eyes. But your smile, though cordial, had no recognition in it. You kissed me yet again, but you did not recognize me.

I hurried away, for my eyes were filling with tears, and I did not want you to see. In the entry, as I precipitated myself from the room, I almost cannoned into John, your servant. Embarrassed but zealous, he got out of my way, and opened the front door for me. Then, in this fugitive instant, as I looked at him through my tears, a light suddenly flooded the old man’s face. In this fugitive instant, I tell you, he recognized me, the man who had never seen me since my childhood. I was so grateful that I could have kneeled before him and kissed his hands. I tore from my muff the banknotes with which you had scourged me, and thrust them upon him. He glanced at me in alarm—for in this instant I think he understood more of me than you have understood in your whole life. Everyone, everyone, has been eager to spoil me;everyone has loaded me with kindness. But you, only you, forgot me. You, only you, never recognized me.





My boy, our boy, is dead. I have no one left to love; no one in the world, except you. But what can you be to me—you who have never, never recognized me, you who stepped across me as you might step across a stream, you who trod on me as you might tread on a stone, you who went on your way unheeding, while you left me to wait for all eternity? Once I fancied that I could hold you for my own; that I held you, the elusive, in the child. But he was your son! In the night, he cruelly slipped away from me on a journey; he has forgotten me, and will never return. I am alone once more, more utterly alone than ever. I have nothing, nothing from you. No child, no word, no line of writing, no place in your memory. If anyone were to mention my name in your presence, to you it would be the name of a stranger. Shall I not be glad to die, since I am dead to you? Glad to go away, since you have gone away from me?

Beloved, I am not blaming you. I do not wish to intrude my sorrows into your joyful life. Do not fear that I shall ever trouble you further. Bear with me for giving way to the longing to cry out my heart to you this once, in the bitter hour when the boy lies dead. Only this once I must talk to you. Then I shall slip back into obscurity, and be dumb towards you as I have ever been. You will not even hear my cry so long as I continue to live. Only when I am dead will this heritage come to you from one who has loved you more fondly than any other has loved you, from one whom you have never recognized, from one who has always been awaiting your summons and whom you have never summoned. Perhaps, perhaps when you receive this legacy you will call to me; and for the first time I shall be unfaithful to you, for I shall not hear you in the sleep of death. Neither picture nor token do I leave you, just as you left me nothing, for never will you recognize me now. That was my fate in life, and it shall be my fate in death likewise. I shall not summon you in my last hour; I shall go my way leaving you ignorant of my name and my appearance. Death will be easy to me, for you will not feel it from afar. I could not die if my death were going to give you pain.

I cannot write any more. My head is so heavy; my limbs ache; I am feverish. I must lie down. Perhaps all will soon be over. Perhaps, this once, fate will be kind to me, and I shall not have to see them take away my boy....I cannot write any more. Farewell, dear one, farewell. All my thanks go out to you. What happened was good in spite of everything. I shall be thankful to you till my last breath. I am so glad that I have told you all. Now, you will know, though you can never fully understand, how much I have loved you; and yet my love will never be a burden to you. It is my solace that I shall not fail you. Nothing will be changed in your bright and lovely life. Beloved, my death will not harm you. This comforts me.

But who, ah who, will now send you white roses on your birthday? The vase will be empty. No longer will come that breath, that aroma, from my life, which once a year was breathed into your room. I have one last request—the first, and the last. Do it for my sake. Always on your birthday—a day when one thinks of oneself—get some roses and put them in the vase. Do it just as others, once a year, have a Mass said for the beloved dead. I no longer believe in God, and therefore I do not want a Mass said for me. I believe in you alone. I love none but you. Only in you do I wish to go on living – just one day in the year, softly, quietly, as I have always lived near you. Please do this, my darling, please do it...My first request, and my last....Thanks, thanks...I love you, I love you....Farewell.....

The letter fell from his nerveless hands. He thought long and deeply. Yes, he had vague memories of a neighbour’s child, of a girl, of a woman in a dancing-hall—all was dim and confused, like a flickering and shapeless view of a stone in the bed of a swiftly running stream. Shadows chased one another across his mind, but would not fuse into a picture. There were stirrings of memory in the realm of feeling, and still he could not remember. It seemed to him that he must have dreamed of all these figures, must have dreamed often and vividly—and yet they had only been the phantoms of a dream. His eyes wandered to the blue vase on the writing-table. It was empty. For years it had not been empty on his birthday. He shuddered, feeling as if an invisible door had been suddenly opened, a door through which a chill breeze from another world was blowing into his sheltered room. An intimation of death came to him, and an intimation of deathless love. Something welled up within him; and the thought of the dead woman stirred in his mind, bodiless and passionate, like the sound of distant music.





MOONBEAM ALLEY


STORMY weather had delayed the ship, so that the evening was far advanced before she came to port on the French coast. Having missed the train which was to have carried me farther on my journey, I had a whole twenty-four hours on my hands. How could I best while away the time, marooned as I was in this unknown coast-town? There did not seem to be much doing. Melancholy strains of dance music issued from a dubious looking haunt—not particularly attractive, I thought. The alternative would be to spend the interlude in desultory converse with my fellow-passengers. In the dining-room of the third-rate hotel where we put up, the air was thick with the smell of burned fat and tobacco smoke. Besides, it was an ill-kept and dirty place, its filthiness rendered all the more intolerable since for many days now I had enjoyed the pure ocean breezes and felt the salt, sweet taste of sea-spume upon my lips. I decided to go for a stroll along the broad main street leading to a square where the local band was giving a concert. It was pleasant to allow oneself to be carried gently along by the stream of idlers who, having done their work for the day, were taking the air after a wash and brush-up followed by a cosy meal at a provincial fireside. After a while, however, the jostling of the crowd and its empty laughter vexed me sorely; I found it exasperating to be gaped at because I happened to be a stranger in their midst; the physical proximity of so many unknown human beings was nauseating in the extreme.

The voyage had been far from calm, and the movement of swelling waters was still in my veins. Under foot the earth seemed to be heaving and rolling, the whole street and the skies swayed like a see-saw. I felt giddy and in order to escape, I ducked my head and plunged down a side street without taking the trouble to decipher its name. This led me into an even narrower thoroughfare where the din of music and mob was muffled almost to extinction. One street opened out of another like the anastomoses of arteries and veins. They were less well lighted the farther I withdrew from the central square which was brightly illuminated with arc-lamps. Overhead the stars could be distinguished, now that my eyes were no longer dazzled by the glare. How dark the intervening spaces of heaven appeared as I gazed upward!

This must be “Sailor-town,” quite near the harbour for my nostrils were tickled with the stench of rotting fish and seaweed and tar, with the indescribable odour issuing from badly ventilated houses wherein the air remains stagnant until it is swept away by a health bringing gale. Such twilight as hung over these alleyways was healing to my mind. It was delightful to be alone. I slackened my pace, studied the narrow streets each of which was different from the others, being here coquettish or amorous, there wrapped in inviolable peace. All, however, were dark, and filled with the soft murmur of voices and music which arose from nowhere in particular, but from unseen springs deep within the houses. Doors and windows were tightly shut, and the only lights were red or yellow lanterns hanging from a porch at rare intervals.

I have a special predilection for such quarters in unknown towns, these foul market-places of the passions, filled with temptations for men who sail the seas and who turn in here for a night of pleasure, hoping to realize their dreams in one short hour on land. These places are obliged to tuck themselves away out of sight in the less “respectable”areas of the town, because they tell a plain tale which the snug and well-built houses of the elect hide behind a hundred veils. Tiny rooms are crowded with dancing couples; glaring placards lure into the picture-houses, square-faced lanterns twinkle in doorways and beckon unambiguously to the passerby. Drunken voices clamour from behind the red-curtained windows of drinking booths. Sailors grin at one another when they meet, their eyes are greedy with expectation, for here they may find women and gambling, drink and display, adventure that is sordid or worth the risk. But these allurements are discreetly housed behind drawn blinds. You have to go inside to find them out, and the mystery only serves to enhance the lure. Similar streets and alleys exist in Hamburg and Colombo and Havana and Liverpool, just as in these cities the broad avenues and boulevards where the wealthy forgather are likewise to be found, for the upper stratum of life and the lower bear a close resemblance everywhere in the matter of form. These disorderly streets are strange vestiges of an unregulated world of the senses, where impulses continue to discharge themselves brutally and without rein;they are a gloomy forest of the passions, a covert full of manifestations of our instinctive and animal existence; they stimulate by what they disclose, and allure by the suggestion of what they hide. They haunt our dreams.

A sensation of being trapped in this maze overwhelmed me. I had chanced to follow a couple of cuirassiers who, with swords clanking along the uneven pavement, were taking a stroll. Some women on the booze in a bar shouted coarse jokes as the pair sauntered by; shrieks of laughter, a finger knocking on the window, an oath from within—and then the men went on. Soon the ribald mirth grew so faint that I could barely catch the sound. Silence closed round me, a few windows were dimly lighted, the watery moon shone through the mist. I breathed my fill of the stillness, which was almost uncanny, seeing that behind it lurked a universe of mystery, sensuousness, and peril. The silence was a lie, for it covered the accumulated filth of a whole world. I stood listening, and peering into the void. All sense of the town, the street, its name, and even my own name vanished; I was cut adrift, my body in some miraculous way had been taken possession of by a stranger, I had no activity in view, no reason for being where I was, no relationship to my surroundings—and yet I was acutely conscious of the seething life that beset me on all sides; it flowed through my veins as if it were my own blood. Nothing that was happening was doing so on my account, though everything was germane to myself. An inexpressibly delightful, feeling that I was not a participator was accompanied by the conviction that I was in for an experience which would bore down into the deepest springs of my being—a feeling which, whenever it comes to me, suffuses me with a pleasure that emanates from communion with the unconscious.

As I stood thus expectant, listening into the void, a voice came to me from a distance, muffled by intervening walls, but unmistakably singing in German. A simple melody, indeed; the “Schoner, gruner Jungfernkranz” from Weber’s Freischutz. A woman’s voice badly trained, but German, yes indeed, German. Strange to hear one’s own tongue in so out-of-the-way a corner; and friendly, homely, at the same time. Poorly as the air was sung, it held a greeting from the land of my birth. Who can speak German here, who can be moved to hum this innocent refrain? Straining my ears against house after house, I reached one where there was a glimmer in one of the windows, and the shadow of a hand silhouetted against the blind. All doors were shut, and yet invitation to enter was to be deciphered on every brick and lintel. Nearer and nearer I approached the sound. This was the house! I hesitated a moment, and then pushed my shoulder against the door, having drawn aside a curtain which shielded the interior from draughts. On the threshold I entered a man whose face was reddened by the hanging lamp, and was livid with fury. He scowled at me, murmured an apology, and thrust past me into the alley. “Queer customer,” thought I, gazing after him. Meanwhile the voice continued singing; clearer than before it seemed to me. I boldly entered.

The song was cut off sharp, as with a knife. A terrible silence compassed me about, giving me the impression that I had destroyed something. Gradually my eyes grew accustomed to the dim lighting, and I found that the room was scantily furnished with a little bar at one end, a table, a couple of chairs—obviously a mere waiting-room for the true business of the establishment which went on in the background. Nor was it difficult to guess what the real business was, for along a passage there were many doors, some of them ajar, leading into bedrooms in which beneath deeply shaded lamps double beds were to be discerned. A girl was seated on a bench leaning her elbows on the table; she was heavily made up, and appeared extremely tired. Behind the bar was a blowzy woman, slatternly and fat, with a second girl, a rather pretty lass, at her side. My good evening fell flat and was not echoed back to me for a considerable time. It was eerie to have stepped into this silence of the desert, and I wished to get clear away. Yet, since there did not seem to be adequate reason for absconding, I took a place at the table and resigned myself to the inevitable.

Suddenly remembering her business in life, the girl got up and asked me what I wished to drink, and I recognised at once by her guttural pronunciation of the French words that she hailed from Germany. I ordered beer, which she fetched and brought to me, shuffling her feet in slovenly fashion, thus betraying even greater indifference than did her lack-lustre eyes. Following the custom of such haunts, she placed another glass next mine and sat down before it. She raised her glass with a nod of greeting in my direction, but she gazed through and beyond me. I had a good look at her. A beautiful face still, with regular features; but it had grown like a mask, since the inner fires were quenched. There was a touch of coarseness about it, the skin and muscles were lax, the lids heavy, the hair unkempt, and two furrows had already formed on either side of the mouth. Her dress was disorderly, her voice husky from too much smoking and beer-drinking. Here undubitably was a fellow-mortal who was weary unto death, and who only continued having out of long-established habit. Embarrassed and horrified, I asked her a question. She answered without looking at me and scarcely moving her lips. I guessed that my coming was unwelcome. The elder woman behind the bar yawned prodigiously, the younger girl slouched in a corner, as if waiting for me to call her. If I could have got away, I should have done so precipitately. But my limbs were like lead and I sat on inert, chained by disgust and curiosity, for, to speak frankly, this indifference stirred me strangely.

The girl next me suddenly burst into a fit of shrill laughter. Simultaneously, the flame of the lamp flickered in a draught of cold air coming through the open doorway.

“So you’ve come back,” said the girl in German.

“Creeping round the house again, you mean skunk. Oh, come along in—I shan’t do you any harm.”

I turned first to the speaker whose mouth seemed to be spewing forth fire, and then to the door. Slinking in was the individual who had scuttled away on my entry. He was a cringing creature holding his hat in his hand like a beggar, trembling under the douche of words that had greeted him, writhing beneath the torrential flow of mirthless laughter, and rendered even more uneasy by the way in which, from behind the bar, the hostess was whispering to the girl.

“Go and sit down beside Francoise,” the young woman said hectoringly. “Can’t you see I’ve got a gentleman customer?”

She spoke to him exclusively in the German tongue, while the hostess and the younger girl split their sides with laughter though they could not understand a word she said. The man was evidently a habitue.

“Give him a bottle of champagne, Francoise, the most expensive brand,” she yelled mockingly. “And if it’s too dear for you, my man, you’ve only got to stay outside and not come bothering us. You’d like to have me for nothing I know, and anything else you could get without paying you’d grab. Ugh, you filthy beast.”

The tall figure crumbled under the lash of this tongue. Like a whipped cur, he sidled up to the counter and with a trembling hand he poured the wine into a glass. He evidently wanted to look at the slattern who was abusing him, and yet he was unable to lift his gaze from the floor. The lamplight caught his face, and I saw before me an emaciated visage, with damp locks of hair sticking in wisps on the brow. His limbs were slack, as if broken at the joints. He was a pitiable object, devoid of strength and yet not wholly lacking in a kind of vicious courage. Everything about him was askew; and the eyes he raised for a flash did not look straight, but were shifty and full of a wicked light.

“Don’t bother about him,” said the girl to me in her ponderous French and seizing me roughly by the arm as though she wanted me to turn away from my contemplation. “It’s an old story between him and me. Doesn’t date from yesterday!” She bared her teeth like a vixen ready to bite, and snarled: “You just listen to what I tell you, old fox. I’d rather fling myself into the sea than go with you. Got it?”

Again the sally was applauded by shouts of laughter from behind the bar. The pleasantry seemed to be a joy which was daily renewed. Then a horrible thing happened. The younger wench put her arms round the man in simulated affection and caressed him tenderly. He winced under her touch, and glanced at me, anxious and cringing. At the same moment the woman next me threw off her inertia as if she had just awakened from profound sleep, and her countenance was so contorted with malevolence, her hands trembled so violently, that I could bear the scene no longer. Throwing some coins upon the table, I rose to go. But she detained me, saying:

“If he’s bothering you, I’ll chuck him out, the swine. He’s jolly well got to do what he’s told. Come, let’s drink another glass together.”

She pressed up against me with assumed ardour, and I knew at once that she was playing a game in order to torment the man, for she kept on glancing in his direction out of the corner of her eyes. Disgust filled me when I saw how, with every endearment she lavished upon me, the poor wretch shrank together as if branded with a red-hot iron. I could not take my eyes off him, and I shivered when it became evident what a storm of rage, jealousy, and desire was brewing within him. Yet, every time the girl looked towards him, he ducked his head in fear. She sidled closer, and I could feel her body quivering with pleasure as she pursued her wicked game. The scent of cheap powder and unwashed skin was sickening, and in order to keep her at a distance I took a cigar out of my case. Before I had time to light it, the girl was screaming.

“Here, you, bring a light, and be quick about it.”

It was horrible to make myself a party to her machinations by allowing the man to serve me, and I made what haste I could to find a match for myself. But her orders has already whipped the poor devil into activity, and he shuffled up to the table with the necessary kindling material. Our eyes crossed, and in his I read abysmal shame mingled with pusillanimous bitterness. This look touched a brotherly chord in me and made me vibrate in sympathy with his humiliation. I said in German:

“Thank you, Sir; but you should not have bothered.”

I offered him my hand. He hesitated for a moment, then my fingers were squeezed between his bony fists. Gratitude shone from his eyes during the second he fixed me, but soon he lowered his puffy lids. Defiance made me want to invite him to sit with us, and I had probably made a gesture of invitation for, ere the words dropped from my lips, the woman had said harshly:

“Back to your place, at once, and don’t come bothering round here again.”

I was nauseated by her strident voice and her whole demeanour. Why should I worry my head about this repulsive harlot, this weak-minded wench, this sewer of beer and cheap scent and tobacco-smoke? I longed for a breath of fresh air. I pushed the money towards her, stood up, and, when she tried to detain me with her endearments, I moved resolutely towards the exit. I could not participate in the humiliation of a fellow creature, and I made it clear to the girl that her charms had no attractions for me. An angry flush spread over her face and neck, fierce words trembled on her lips; but she did not speak. She merely turned to the man and looked at him so meaningly that with the utmost speed he sought to do her unspoken bidding. His fingers shot down into his pocket, and he drew forth a purse. He was evidently frightened at being left alone with her, and in his excitement fumbled with the opening. I guessed that he was not accustomed to spending money freely, he had none of the generous way of a sailor who flings his coins carelessly about. This man was used to counting money carefully, and to testing the pieces between his fingers before paying them away—as he now paid for his champagne.

“look how he’s trembling because he has to part with some of his beloved pence,” she cried tauntingly, stepping nearer to him. “Too slow, I tell you. Just wait till I...”

He shrank back in fear. When she saw how frightened he was, she shrugged her shoulders and said jeeringly, and with an indescribable expression of disgust on her face:

“I’m not going to take anything away from you. I spit on your money. It is all counted beforehand I know; never a farthing too much must be allowed to leave your purse. But,” and she tapped him on the chest, “What about the bit of paper you’ve so carefully stitched into your waistcoat lining?”

His hand went to his side as if he were seized with a spasm of the heart. Having felt the place, his face, which had gone ashen pale, resumed its normal hue and his hand dropped away again.

“Miser,” she screamed.

At this the martyr turned, flung the purse and its contents into the younger girl’s lap, and rushed out as if the place were on fire. At first the girl gave a shriek of alarm, then, realizing what the man had done she broke into peal upon peal of piercing laughter.

The woman stood for a moment rigid, her eyes sparkling with wrath. Then her lids closed, and her body went limp. She looked old and tired. A forlorn and dipping figure swayed before me.

“He’ll be weeping over his lost money, out there. May even go to the police-station and tell them we’ve stolen it To-morrow he’ll be here again. But he won’t get me, no that he won’t. I’ll give myself to anyone who offers, but never to him.”

She stepped up to the bar and gulped down a glass of neat brandy. The wickedness still glinted in her eyes but it was misty now as if shining from behind a veil of tears. My gorge rose as I looked at her, so that I could find no compassion in my heart.

“Good evening,” I said as I took my leave.

“Bon soir,” answered the hostess, without a glance in my direction.

Shrill and mocking laughter followed me into the street.

As I stepped forth into the alley, it seemed to me darker than ever, closed in by the starless sky and the night; but soon the pale moon shone down again, bringing me infinite alleviation. I took a deep breath, and the horror left me. Now I could once more relish the amazing tangle of human destinies; and a feeling of beatitude, akin to tears, filled me at the thought that behind every window fate was waiting, that at the opening of every door an experience was ready for the taking, that the multitudinous happenings of this world are ever present for those who choose to observe them, that even the foulest hovel is bursting with newly generated life like dung filled with the larvae that will become shining beetles. The unsavoury encounter was no longer repulsive to me. On the contrary, the suspense it had produced in my mind now relaxed into an agreeable sensation of lassitude, and my sole desire was to convert my adventure into beautiful dreams. I cast a searching eye up and down the narrow street, wondering which direction would lead me back to the hotel. A shadow fell across my path.

“Beg pardon, Sir,” said a familiar whining voice in my native tongue, “But I’m afraid you will have some difficulty in finding your way out of the maze. May I act as guide, Sir? Your hotel, Sir?”

I gave him the name.

“Yes, Sir, I know it, Sir. Will you allow me to accompany you,Sir?” he asked apologetically.

A shudder crept over me. It was horrible to have this slouching, ghostlike creature walking by my side, noiselessly, as if on stockinged feet. My perception of the gloom in the alleyways of the sailors’ quarter, the memory of my recent experience, were spontaneously replaced by a state of confused reverie. I knew that my companion’s eyes still held the same meek expression, that his lips still twitched nervously, that he wanted to talk. But I did not wish to rouse myself from the inertia of mind which enfolded me, in order to take any active interest in the fellow. He hemmed, words choked in his throat, and I felt a cruel pleasure in not coming to his aid. Repulsion at the recollection of that dreadful woman spread through me like a miasma, and I was glad the man’s shame should be wrestling with his spiritual need for explanation. No, I did not help him; but allowed a heavy curtain of silence to hang black and awesome between us. My footsteps rang out clear and youthful in contrast to his muffled and aged tread. The tension between his soul and mine grew stronger every minute. The silence became strident with unspoken words. At last the string, stretched to breaking-point, snapped, and he blurted out:

“You have...you have just witnessed a strange scene, Sir. I beg you to forgive me, Sir, if I refer to it...but it must have appeared very peculiar to you, Sir, and you must think me a ludicrous fellow, but you see, Sir, the woman...well, she is....”

He had got stuck again. His throat worked. Then, in a very small voice, he said hastily:

“She’s my wife, Sir...”

I must have shown surprise, for he hurriedly continued as if wishing to excuse himself.

“That is to say, Sir, she was my wife, five, no four years ago at Geratzheim in Hesse where I have my home. Please, Sir, you really must not think badly of her. It’s probably my fault that she has become what she is.. She was not always thus. But I...I teased and plagued her. You see, Sir, I married her in spite her abject poverty. Why, she had hardly a chemise to her back, nothing, nothing at all. Whereas I am well-to-do, or rather I am comfortably off...at least I had a pretty competence in those days...and I was, perhaps—she is right—I was thrifty...yes, I was thrifty even before our great misfortune. But you see, Sir, my father and mother were so, and the whole family a bit on the stingy side. Besides, I worked hard for every penny I earned. She was fond of pretty things, and, being poor, she had nothing but what I gave her. I was constantly reminding her of this. Oh, I know it was wrong of me—I’ve had time to learn that since the catastrophe—for she was proud, very proud. Please don’t run away with the idea that she is naturally of such a disposition as you witnessed this evening. Far from it, Sir; that’s all make-believe. She hurts herself in order to make me suffer in order to torture me, and because she is ashamed of her own doings, of her present mode of life. Maybe she has gone to the bad, but I...I refuse to accept such a notion...for I remember how good, how very good she used to be, Sir.”

His excitement made him pause, both in speech and walk, while he wiped his eyes. I looked at him in spite of myself. He no longer appeared to be a figure of fun, and I was no longer annoyed by his constant repetition of the obsequious “Sir.” The energy he had put into phrasing his explanation had transfigured his countenance. We started forward again, and he kept his eyes downcast as if reading his story printed upon the pavement. He sighed heavily, and his voice took on a sonorous tone very different from the querulous sound I had come to expect from him.

“Yes, Sir, she was good—good, and kind to me as well—she was grateful for having been raised out of her misery. I knew how thankful she was...but I wanted to hear her say so...always and always again...I could not listen too often to the verbal expression of her gratitude. You see, Sir, it is so wonderful to feel that someone considers you to be better than you really are. I would willingly have parted with all my money just to hear her say those few words, everlastingly renewed...but she had her proper pride, and she found it increasingly difficult to acknowledge her debt to me, especially when I made a claim upon her in the matter and almost ordered her point-blank to pronounce the words I longed to hear....And so, Sir, I insisted that she ask me for everything she wanted, for every dress, for every scrap of ribbon....Three years I tortured her thus, and her martyrdom grew worse as the time went by. And believe me, Sir, it was all because I loved her so desperately. I loved her proud bearing, and yet I wished to humiliate her. Oh, fool that I was! I pretended to be vexed when she asked for a hat, or any other trifle she took a fancy for; while all the time I was in the seventh heaven of delight at being given an opportunity to gratify her—and at the same time to make her eat humble-pie. In those days, Sir, I did not realize how dear she was to me....”

Again he stopped, and reeled in his gait. He had forgotten my existence, and spoke henceforward as if in a hypnotic trance.

“I only discovered how greatly I loved her on the day—the accursed day—when she begged me to give her something to help her mother out of a difficulty, and I refused. It was an insignificant sum....I had actually put the money aside for the purpose...but I longed for her to ask me again...and then, when I came home I found a letter on the table and learned that she had gone...All she wrote was: ‘Keep your damned money. I’ll never ask you for another penny.’ That’s all. Nothing more. I was like one demented for three days and three nights. I had the river dragged and the forest scoured; indeed I paid hundreds over to the authorities in the hope of discovering her whereabouts. I even confided my troubles to the neighbours—but they merely laughed me to scorn. No trace, no trace at all. Months later, I learned that someone had seen her in the train, accompanied by a soldier...a train going to Berlin. That very day I went to the capital, leaving my business to take care of itself. Thousands did I lose in the process. My farm labourers, my manager, my...oh, everyone profited by my absence to line his pockets. But I assure you, Sir, I remained indifferent to these losses...I stayed a week in Berlin...and, at last, I found her....”

He panted slightly, and then continued:

“I assure you, Sir, I never said a harsh word to her...I wept...I knelt before her...I offered her anything she pleased....She would hence forward be the mistress of all I possessed—for I had come to realize that life without her was impossible....I loved every hair on her head, her mouth, her body, every part and particle of her being. I bribed the landlady (she was, in fact, a procuress, what they call a ‘white-slave trader’) generously and thus managed to see poor Lise alone. Her face was like chalk; but she listened to me, oh, Sir I believe she really listened to me as if pleased, pleased to see me. But when I began to speak of the money it was necessary to pay—and after all, Sir, you will agree that we were obliged to discuss such practical issues—she merely called her fancy—man on to the scene, and the two of them laughed me out of countenance. I did not lose sight of her, Sir, but returned to the charge day after day. The other lodgers told me that the cur had left her, utterly unprovided for. So I sought her out yet again; but she tore up the notes I gave her, and the next time I came—she was gone. Oh, Sir, you can have no idea of what I did to trace her. I followed her for a year, paying agents here and agents there. At last I discovered that she had gone to Argentina...and...and...that she was in...a house...of ill-fame.”

Again he hesitated, and the last two words seemed to stick in his throat. His voice became sombre as he went on:

“At first I could hardly believe my ears...then I reflected that I was to blame, I, only I, because I had humiliated her. And I thought how terribly she must be suffering, she so proud, as I well knew her to be. I got my solicitor to write to the consul out there and I sent money. But she was not to be told from whom it came. The sum was more than sufficient to bring her home again. Soon I got a cable that the scheme had worked, and that the boat would reach Amsterdam on such a date. Well, so great was my impatience that I got there three days too soon. When I saw the smoke in the distance, it seemed to me I could not wait till the ship slowly entered port and came alongside the quay. At last I caught a glimpse of her at the tail of the other passengers, hardly recognizable at first, so heavily was she made up. When she saw me waiting for her, she blanched even under her paint, and tottered so that two ‘Sailors had to support her. No sooner had she stepped to land than I was at her side. I could not speak, my throat felt so dry. She, too, said nothing, and did not look at me. I motioned to a porter to carry the luggage, and we started for the hotel. Suddenly she turned to me and said...oh, Sir, if you could have heard her voice, so sad I thought my heart would break...‘do you want me still as your wife, after...?’ I could only clasp her hand...She trembled violently, but spoke no more. I felt that now all would be well....Ah, Sir, how happy I was. When we got to our room, I danced for joy, I knelt at her feet babbling out the most absurd things—at least I fancy my words must have been rather funny, for she smiled through her tears and stroked my hair—hesitatingly, of course. Her endearments did me good, my heart overflowed. I rushed up and down stairs ordering dinner—I called it our wedding feast. I helped her to change her dress, and then we went down and ate and drank, a merry meal I assure you, Sir. She was like a child, so warm and affectionate, speaking of our home and how everything would start fresh....Then...”

The man’s voice became rasping, and he made a gesture as if he were strangling someone.

“Then...the waiter...a mean and vulgar cur...believed me to be the worse for drink because I laughed so much and had carried on in such a boyish fashion and all because I was so happy, oh, so happy....Well, I paid the bill and he, as I said, thinking me drunk, cheated me out of twenty francs in giving me the change. I called the fellow back, and demanded my due. He looked sheepish, and laid the money by my plate...” Then...quite suddenly...Lise began to laugh. I stared at her perplexed...and her face was completely changed...mocking, hard, angry. ‘The same as ever...even after our wedding feast,’ she said coldly—and yet her voice was full of pity. I cursed myself for having been so particular...but I tried to laugh the matter off....Her gaiety had disappeared...It was dead and gone....She insisted upon being given a separate room....I was in a mood to grant every request...and lay alone, open-eyed, through the night, thinking what I should get her on the morrow...a handsome gift, that would show her I was no longer stingy...at least where she was concerned. Early next morning I was abroad...I bought a bracelet...and took it to her in her room...but she was no longer there...she had gone...as she had gone before. I looked round for a note...praying it would not be there, yet knowing that it would inevitably be awaiting me and there it was, sure enough, on the dressing-table and on it was scribbled...”

He hesitated. I stood still, looking into his martyred face. The man bowed his head, and whispered hoarsely:

“She had written...‘Leave me in peace. You are utterly repulsive to me.’”

Our walk had led us to the harbour; and, in the distance, the silence was broken by the roar of the Atlantic breakers on the coast. The vessels, their lights shining like the eyes of huge animals, swung at their anchors. A song floated to me from afar. Nothing was very clear. I seemed to feel presences rather than see them. The town was sleeping and dreaming an immense dream. By my side I distinguished the ghostly shadow of the man growing uncannily large and then dwindling to dwarfed proportions in the flickering lamp-light. I was not inclined to speak, or to offer consolation, or to ask questions. The silence stuck to me heavy and oppressive. Suddenly he seized my arm and said quaveringly:

“But I’m determined not to leave this town without her....After many months of search I found her....I am invulnerable to the martyrdom she is putting me through...I beseech you, Sir, to have a word with her...she refuses to listen if I speak...I must get her to come back....Oh, won’t you tell her she ought to? Please, Sir, have a try....I can’t go on living like this. I can’t bear any longer to see other men go in there, knowing she is giving herself to them, while I wait in the street till they come down again, laughing and tipsy. The whole neighbourhood knows me by now, and the people make mock of me when they see me waiting out on the pavement....I shall go mad, but I must keep my vigil without fail....Oh, Sir, I do beg of you to speak to her....You are a stranger, I know, but for God’s sake, Sir, have a word with her. Someone from her own country might influence her in this foreign land.”

I wished to free my arm from the man’s convulsive grip. Loathing and disgust alienated my sympathies. When he felt that I was trying to get away, he flung himself on to his knees in the middle of the street and clasped my legs.

“I conjure you, Sir, to speak to her; you must, you must—or something terrible will happen. All my money’s gone in tracing her, and I’m not going to leave her here...not alive. I’ve bought a knife. Yes, Sir, I’ve got a knife. I won’t let her stay here; at least not alive; I could not bear it. Oh, speak to her, Sir, I beg and pray you to have a talk with her....”

He crouched like a maniac before me. At that moment two policemen turned into the street. I dragged him violently to his feet. He looked at me blankly for a moment, and then said in an utterly changed voice: “Take the first turning on your right, and the hotel is about halfway down.”

Once more he stared at me with eyes wherein the pupils seemed to have melted away into a bleak, white void. Then he vanished.

I hugged myself in my coat, for I was shivering. I was tired; and sleep, a kind of drunken sleep, black and feelingless, claimed me. I wanted to think, to turn these things over in my mind, but sleep was ruthless and would not be put off. I got to my hotel, fell on to the bed, and slept like an animal.

In the morning it was hard to disentangle dream from reality, and something within me urged me not to try and find out. I woke late, a stranger in a strange city, and visited a church far-famed for its mosaics. But my eyes were blind to such sights. The night’s adventure rose vividly before my mind, and unconsciously my feet sought that alleyway and that house. But such thoroughfares do not become alive until after dark. During the daytime they wear cold, grey masks, and it is only those who know them well who are able to recognize one from another. Search as I might, I did not find the street I wanted. Weary and disappointed I returned to the hotel, followed by pictures that were either the figment of a disordered brain, or the remembrance of reality.

The train was scheduled to leave at nine o’clock that evening. I felt sorry to quit. A porter carried my bags to the station. Then, at a crossing, I recognized the street leading to that house. Telling the man to wait a minute, I went to cast a final glance at the site of my adventure, leaving the fellow smirking in a knowing way.

Yes, here it was, dark as last night, with the moonlight shining on the window-panes, and outlining the door. I was drawing nearer, when a figure emerged from the shadows. I recognized the German cowering on the threshold. He beckoned for me to approach. But mingled horror and fear made me take to my heels. I did not wish to be delayed, and to miss my train.

At the corner I turned for another look. As my eyes fell upon the poor devil he sprang up and made for the entry. He pushed the door open, and a piece of metal shone in his hand. Was it money or a knifeblade that glittered so treacherously in the moon beams?





THE INVISIBLE COLLECTION


AN EPISODE OF THE INFLATION PERIOD IN GERMANY

AT the first junction beyond Dresden, an elderly gentleman entered our compartment, smiled genially to the company, and gave me a special nod, as if to an old acquaintance. Seeing that I was at a loss, he mentioned his name. Of course I knew him! He was one of the most famous connoisseurs and art-dealers in Berlin. Before the war, I had often purchased autographs and rare books at his place. He took the vacant seat opposite me, and for a while we talked of matters not worth relating. Then, changing the conversation, he explained the object of the journey from which he was returning. It had, he said, been one of the strangest of his experiences in the thirty-seven years he had devoted to the occupation of art-pedlar. Enough introduction. I will let him tell the story in his own words, without using quote-marks—to avoid the complication of wheels within wheels.

You know [he said] what has been going on in my trade since the value of money began to diffuse into the void like gas. War-profiteers have developed a taste for old masters (Madonnas and so on), for incunabula, for ancient tapestries. It is difficult to satisfy their craving;and a man like myself, who prefers to keep the best for his own use and enjoyment, is hard put to it not to have his house stripped bare. If I let them, they would buy the cuff-links from my shirt and the lamp from my writing-table. Harder and harder to find wares to sell. I’m afraid the term “Wares” may grate upon you in this connexion, but you must excuse me. I have picked it up from customers of the new sort. Evil communications....Through use and wont I have come to look upon an invaluable book from one of the early Venetian presses much as the philistine looks upon an overcoat that cost so or so many hundred dollars, and upon a sketch by Guercino as animated by nothing more worthy of reverence than the transmigrated soul of a banknote for a few thousand francs.

Impossible to resist the greed of these fellows with money to burn. As I looked round my place the other night, it seemed to me that there was so little left of any real value that I might as well put up the shutters. Here was a fine business which had come down to me from my father and my grandfather; but the shop was stocked with rubbish which, before 1914, a street-trader would have been ashamed to hawk upon a hand-cart.

In this dilemma, it occurred to me to flutter the pages of our old ledgers. Perhaps I should be put on the track of former customers who might be willing to resell what they had bought in prosperous days. True, such a list of sometime purchasers has considerable resemblance to a battlefield laden with the corpses of the slain; and in fact I soon realized that most of those who had purchased from the firm when the sun was shining were dead or would be in such low water that it was probable they must have sold anything of value among their possessions. However, I came across a bundle of letters from a man who was presumably the oldest yet alive—if he was alive. But he was so old that I had forgotten him, since he had bought nothing after the great explosion in the summer of 1914. Yes, very, very old. The earliest letters were dated more than half a century back, when my grandfather was head of the business. Yet I could not recall having had any personal relationships with him during the thirty-seven years in which I had been an active worker in the establishment.

All indications showed that he must ave been one of those antediluvian eccentrics, a few of whom survive in those German provincial towns. His writing was copperplate, and every item in his orders was underlined in red ink. Each price was given in words as well as figures, so that there could be no mistake. These peculiarities, and his use of torn-out fly-leaves as writing paper, enclosed in a scratch assortment of envelopes, hinted at the penuriousness of a confirmed backwoodsman. His signature was always followed by his style and title in full: “Forest Ranger and Economic Councillor, Retired; Lieutenant,Retired; Holder of the Iron Cross First Class.” Since he was obviously a veteran of the war of 1870-71, he must by now be close on eighty.

For all his cheese-paring and for all his eccentricities, he had manifested exceptional shrewdness, knowledge, and taste as collector of prints and engravings. A careful study of his orders, which had at first totalled very small sums indeed, disclosed that in the days when a thaler could still pay for a pile of lovely German woodcuts, this country bumpkin had got together a collection of etchings and the like outrivalling the widely trumpeted acquisitions of war profiteers. Merely those which, in the course of decades, he had brought from us for trifling sums should be worth a large amount of money to-day; and I had no reason to suppose that he had failed to pick up similar bargains elsewhere. Was his collection dispersed? I was too familiar with what had been going on in the art trade since the date of his last purchase not to feel confident that such a collection could scarcely have changed hands entire without my getting wind of the event. If he was dead, his treasures had probably remained intact in the hands of his heirs.

The affair seemed so interesting that I set forth next day (yesterday evening) on a journey to one of the most out-of-the-way towns in Saxony. When I left the tiny railway station and strolled along the main street, it seemed to me impossible that anyone inhabiting one of these gimcrack houses, furnished in a way with which you are doubtless familiar, could possibly own a full of magnificent Rembrandt etchings together with an precedented number of Durer wood cuts and a complete collection of Mantegnas. However, I went to the post office to inquire, and was astonished to learn that sometime Forest Ranger and Economic Councillor of name I mentioned was still living. They told me how to find his house, and I will admit that my heart beat faster than usual as I made my way thither. It was well before noon.

The connoisseur of whom I was in search lived on the second floor of one of those jerry-built houses which were run up in such numbers by speculators during the sixties of the last century. The first floor was occupied by master tailor. On the second landing to the left was the name-plate of the manager of the local post-office while the porcelain shield on the right-hand door bore the name of my quarry. I had run him to earth! My ring was promptly answered by a very old, white-haired woman wearing a black lace cap. I handed her my card and asked whether the master was at home. With air of suspicion she glanced at me, at the card, and then back at my face once more. In this God-forsaken little town a visit from an inhabitant of the metropolis was a disturbing event. However, in as friendly a tone as she could muster, she asked me to be good enough to wait a minute or two in the hall, and vanished through doorway. I heard whispering, and then a loud, hearty, masculine voice: “Herr Rackner from Berlin, you say, the famous dealer in antiquities? Of course I shall be delighted to see him.” Thereupon the old woman reappeared and invited me to enter.

I took off my overcoat, and followed her. In the middle of the cheaply furnished room was a man standing up to receive me. Old but hale, he had a bushy moustache and was wearing a semi-military frogged smoking-jacket. In the most cordial way, he held out both hands towards me. But though this gesture was spontaneous and in no wise forced, it was in strange contrast with the stiffness of his attitude. He did not advance to meet me, so that I was compelled (I must confess I was a trifle piqued) to walk right up to him before I could shake. Then I noticed that his hand, too, did not seek mine, but was waiting for mine to clasp it. At length I guessed what was amiss. He was blind.

Ever since I was a child I have been uncomfortable in presence of the blind. It embarrasses me, produces in me a sense of bewilderment and shame to encounter anyone who is thoroughly alive, and yet has not the full use of his senses. I feel as if I were taking an unfair advantage, and I was keenly conscious of this sensation as I glanced into the fixed and sightless orbs beneath the bristling white eyebrows. The blind man, however, did not leave me time to dwell upon this discomfort. He exclaimed, laughing with boisterous delight:

“A red-letter day, indeed! Seems almost a miracle that one of the big men of Berlin should drop in as you have done. There’s need for us provincials to be careful, you know, when a noted dealer such as yourself is on the war-path. We’ve a saying in this part of the world:‘Shut your doors and button up your pockets if there are gipsies about!’ I can guess why you’ve taken the trouble to call. Business doesn’t thrive, I’ve gathered. No buyers or very few, so people are looking up their old customers. I’m afraid you’ll draw a blank. We pensioners are glad enough to find there’s still some bread for dinner. I’ve been a collector in my time, but now I’m out of the game. My buying days are over.”

I hastened to tell him he was under a misapprehension, that I had not called with any thought of effecting sales. Happening to be in the neighbourhood I felt loath to miss the chance of paying my respects to a long standing customer who was at the same time one of the most famous among German collectors. Hardly had the phrase passed my lips when a remarkable change took place in the old man’s expression. He stood stiffly in the middle of the room, but his face lighted up and his whole aspect was suffused with pride. He turned in the direction where he fancied his wife to be, and nodded as if to say, “D’you hear that?”Then, turning back to me, he resumed—having dropped the brusque, drill-sergeant tone he had previously used, and speaking in a gentle, nay, almost tender voice:

“How charming of you....I should be sorry, however, if your visit were to result in nothing more than your making the personal acquaintanceship of an old buffer like myself. At any rate I’ve something worth while for you to see-more worth while than you could find in Berlin in the Albertina at Vienna, or even in the Louvre (God’s curse on Paris!) A man who has been a diligent collector for fifty years, with taste to guide him, gets hold of treasures that are not to be picked up at every street-corner. Lisbeth, give me the key of the cupboard, please.”

Now a strange thing happened. His wife, who had been listening with a pleasant smile, was startled. She raised her hands towards me, clasped them imploringly, and shook her head. What these gestures signified was a puzzle to me. Next she went up to her husband and touched his shoulder, saying:

“Franz, dear, you have forgotten to ask our visitor whether he may not have another appointment; and, anyhow, it is almost dinner-time.—I am sorry,” she went on, looking at me, “That we have not enough in the house for an unexpected guest. No doubt you will dine at the inn.If you will take a cup of coffee with us afterwords, my daughter Anna Maria will be here, and she is much better acquainted than I am with the contents of the portfolios.”

Once more she glanced piteously at me. It was plain that she wanted me to refuse the proposal to examine the collection there and then. Taking my cue, I said that in fact I had a dinner engagement at the Golden Stag, but should be only too delighted to return at three, when there would be plenty of time to examine anything Herr Kronfeld wanted to show me. I was not leaving before six o’clock.

The veteran was as pettish as a child deprived of a favourite toy.

“Of course,” he growled, “I know you mandarins from Berlin have extensive claims on your time. Still, I really think you will do well to spare me a few hours. It is not merely two or three prints I want to show you, but the contents of twenty-seven portfolios, one for each master, and all of them full to bursting. However, if you come at three sharp, I dare say we can get through by six.”

The wife saw me out. In the entrance hall, before she opened the front door, she whispered:

“Do you mind if Anna Maria comes to see you at the hotel before you return? It will be better for various reasons which I cannot explain just now.”

“Of Course, of course, a great pleasure. Really, I am dining alone, and your daughter can come along directly you have finished your own meal.”

An hour later, when I had removed from the dining-room to the parlour of the Golden Stag, Anna Maria Kronfeld arrived. An old maid, wizened and diffident, plainly dressed, she contemplated me with embarrassment. I did my best to put her at her ease, and express my readiness to go back with her at once, if her father was impatient, though it was short of the appointed hour. At this she reddened, grew even more confused and then stammered a request for a little talk before we set out.

“Please sit down,” I answered. “I am entirely at your service.”

She found it difficult to begin. Her hands and her lips trembled. At length: “My mother sent me. We have to ask a favour of you. Directly you get back, Father will want to show you his collection; and the collection...the collection. Well, there’s very little of it left.”

She panted, almost sobbed, and went on breathlessly:

“I must be frank...” You know what troublous times we are passing through, and I am sure you will understand. Soon after the war broke out, my father became completely blind. His sight had already been failing. Agitation, perhaps, contributed. Though he was over seventy, he wanted to go to the front, remembering the fight in which he had taken part so long ago. Naturally there was no use for his services. Then, when the advance of our armies was checked, he took the matter very much to heart, and the doctor thought that may have precipitated the oncoming of blindness. In other respects, as you will have noticed, he is vigorous. Down to 1914 he could take long walks, and go out shooting. Since the failure of his eyes, his only pleasure is in his collection. He looks at it every day. ‘Looks at it,’ I say, though he sees nothing. Each afternoon he has the portfolios on the table, and fingers the prints one by one, in the order which many years have rendered so familiar. Nothing else interests him. He makes me read reports of auctions; and the higher the prices, the more enthusiastic does he become.

“There’s the dreadful feature of the situation. Father knows nothing about the inflation; that we are ruined; that his monthly pension would not provide us with a day’s food. Then we have others to support. My sister’s husband was killed at Verdun, and there are four children. These money troubles have been kept from him. We cut down expenses as much as we can, but it is impossible to make ends meet. We began to sell things, trinkets and so on, without interfering with his beloved collection. There was very little to sell, since Father had always spent whatever he could scrape together upon woodcuts, copperplate engravings, and the like. The collector’s mania! Well, at length it was a question whether we were to touch the collection or to let him starve. We didn’t ask permission. What would have been the use? He hasn’t the ghost of a notion how hard food is to come by, at any price; has never heard that Germany was defeated and surrendered Alsace-Lorraine. We don’t read him items of that sort from the newspapers!

“The first piece we sold was a very valuable one, a Rembrandt etching, and the dealer paid us a long price, a good many thousand marks. We thought it would last us for years. But you know how money was melting away in 1922 and 1923. After we had provided for our immediate needs, we put the rest in a bank. In two months it was gone! We had to sell another engraving, and then another. That was during the worst days of inflation and each time the dealer delayed settlement until the price was not worth a tenth or a hundredth of what he had promised to pay. We tried auction-rooms, and were cheated there too, though the bids were raised by millions. The million- or milliard-mark notes were waste-paper by the time we got them. The collection was scattered to provide daily bread, and little of that.

“That was why Mother was so much alarmed when you turned up to-day. Directly the portfolios are opened, our pious fraud will be disclosed. He knows each item by touch. You see, every print we disposed of was immediately replaced by a sheet of blank cartridge-paper of the same size and thickness, so that he would notice no difference when he handled it. Feeling them one by one, and counting them, he derives almost much pleasure as if he could actually see them. He never tries to show them to anyone here, where there is no connoisseur, no one worthy to look at them; but he loves each of them so ardently that I think his heart would break if he knew they had been dispersed. The last time he asked someone to look at them, it was the curator of the copper-plate engravings in Dresden, who died years ago.

“I beseech you”—her voice broke—“Not to shatter his illusion, not to undermine his faith, that the treasures he will describe to you are there for the seeing. He would not survive the knowledge of their loss. Perhaps we have wronged him; yet what could we do? One must live. Orphaned children are more valuable than old prints. Besides, it has been life and happiness to him to spend three hours every afternoon going through his imaginary collection, and talking to each specimen as if it were a friend. To-day may be the most enthralling experience since his sight failed. How he has longed for the chance of exhibiting his treasures to an expert! If you will lend yourself to the deception...”

In my cold recital, I cannot convey to you how poignant was this appeal. I have seen many a sordid transaction in my business career,have had to look on supinely while persons ruined by inflation have been diddled out of cherished heirlooms which they were compelled to sacrifice for a crust. But my heart has not been utter calloused, and this tale touched me to the quick. I need hardly tell you that I promised to play up.

We went to her house together. On the way I was grieved (though not surprised) to learn for what preposterously small amounts these ignorant though kind-hearted women had parted with prints many of which were extremely valuable and some of them unique. This confirmed my resolve to give all the help in my power. As we mounted the stairs we heard a jovial shout: “Come in! Come in!” With the keen hearing of the blind he had recognized the footsteps for which he had been eagerly waiting.

“Franz usually takes a siesta after dinner, but excitement kept him awake to-day,” said the old woman, with a smile as she let us in. A glance at her daughter showed her that all was well. The stack of portfolios was on the table. The blind collector seized me by the arm and thrust me into a chair which was placed ready for me.

“Let’s begin at once. There’s a lot to see, and time presses. The first portfolio contains Durers. Nearly a full set, and you’ll think each cut finer than the others. Magnificent specimens. Judge for yourself.”

He opened the portfolio as he spoke saying:

“We start with the Apocalypse series, of course.” Then, tenderly, delicately (as one handles fragile and precious objects), he picked up the first of the blank sheets of cartridge-paper and held it admiringly before my sighted eyes and his blind ones. So enthusiastic was his gaze that it was difficult to believe he could not see. Though I knew it to be fancy, I found it difficult to doubt that there was a glow of recognition in the wrinkled visage.

“Have you ever come across a finer print? How sharp the impression. Every detail crystal-clear. I compared mine with the one at Dresden; a good one, no doubt, but ‘fuzzy’ in contrast with the specimen you are looking at. Then I have the whole pedigree.”

He turned the sheet over and pointed at the back so convincingly that involuntarily I leaned forward to read the non-existent inscriptions.

“The stamp of the Nagler collection, followed by those of Remy and Esdaille. My famous predecessors never thought that their treasure would come to roost in this little room.”

I shuddered as the unsuspecting enthusiast extolled the blank sheet of paper; my flesh crept when he placed a finger-nail on the exact spot where the alleged imprints had been made by long-dead collectors. It was as ghostly as if the disembodied spirits of the men he named had risen from the tomb. My tongue clave to the roof of my mouth—until once more I caught sight of distraught countenances of Kronfelds’ wife and daughter. Then I pulled myself together and resumed my role. With forced heartiness, I exclaimed:

“Certainly you are right. This specimen is peerless.”

He swelled with triumph.

“But that’s nothing,” he went on. “Look at these two the Melancholia, and the illuminated print of the Passion. The latter, beyond question, has no equal. The freshness of the tints! Your colleagues in Berlin and the custodians of the public galleries would turn green with envy at the sight.”

I will not bore you with details. Thus it went on, a paean, for more than two hours, as he ransacked portfolio after portfolio. An eerie business to watch handling of these two or three hundred blanks, to chime in at appropriate moments with praise of merits which for the blind collector were so eminently real that again and again (this was my salvation) his faith kindled my own.

Once only did disaster loom. He was “Showing” me first proof of Rembrandt’s Antiope, which must have been of inestimable value and which had doubtless been sold for a song. Again he dilated on the sharpness of the print as he passed his fingers lightly over it the sensitive tips missed some familiar indentation. His face clouded, his mouth trembled, and he said:

“Surely, surely it’s the Antiope? No one touches the wood-cuts and etchings but myself. How can it have got misplaced?”

“Of course it’s the Antiope, Herr Kronfeld,” I said, hastening to take the “Print” from his hand to expatiate upon various details which my own remembrance enabled me to conjure up upon the blank surface.

His bewilderment faded. The more I praised, the more gratified he became, until at last he said exultantly to the two women:

“Here’s a man who knows what’s what! You have been inclined to grumble at my ‘Squandering’ money upon the collection. It’s true that for half a century and more I denied myself beer, wine, tobacco, travelling, visits to the theatre, books, devoting all I could spare to these purchases you have despised. Well, Herr Rackner confirms my judgment. When I am dead and gone, you’ll be richer than anyone in the town, as wealthy as the wealthiest folk in Dresden, and you’ll have good reason for congratulating yourself on my ‘craze’. But so long as I’m alive, the collection must be kept together. After I’ve been boxed and buried, this expert or another will help you to sell. You’ll have to, since my pension dies with me.”

As he spoke, his fingers caressed the despoiled portfolios. It was horrible and touching. Not for years, not since 1914, had I witnessed an expression of such unmitigated happiness on the face of a German. His wife and daughter watched him with tear-dimmed eyes, yet ecstatically, like those women of old who—affrighted and rapturous—found the stone rolled away and the sepulchre empty in the garden outside the wall of Jerusalem. But the man could not have enough of my appreciation. He went on from portfolio to portfolio from “Print” to “Print”, drinking in my words, until, outwearied, I was glad when the lying blanks were replaced in their cases and room was made to serve coffee on the table.

My host, far from being tired, looked rejuvenated. He had story after story to tell concerning the way he had chanced upon his multifarious treasures, wanting in this connexion, to take out each relevant piece once more. He grew peevish when I insisted, when his wife and daughter insisted, that I should miss my train if he delayed me any longer....

In the end he was reconciled to my going, and we said good-bye. His voice mellowed; he took both my hands in his and fondled them with the tactile appreciation of the blind.

“Your visit has given me immense pleasure,” he said with a quaver in his voice. “What a joy to have been able at long last to show my collection to one competent to appreciate it. I can do something to prove my gratitude, to make your visit to a blind old man worth while. A codicil to my will shall stipulate that your firm, whose probity everyone knows, will be entrusted with the auctioning of my collection.”

He laid a hand lovingly upon the pile of worthless portfolios.

“Promise me they shall have a handsome catalogue. I could ask no better monument.”

I glanced at the two women, who were exercising the utmost control, fearful lest the sound of their trembling should reach his keen ears. I promised the impossible, and he pressed my hand in response.

Wife and daughter accompanied me to the door. They did not venture to speak, but tears were flowing down their cheeks. I myself was in little better case. An art dealer, I had come in search of bargains. Instead, as events turned out, I had been a sort of angel of good-luck, lying like a trooper in order to assist in a fraud which kept an old man happy. Ashamed of lying, I was glad that I had lied. At any rate I had aroused an ecstasy which seems foreign to this period of sorrow and gloom.

As I stepped forth into the street, I heard a window and my name called. Though the old fellow could not see me, he knew in which direction I should walk, and his sightless eyes were turned thither. He leaned out so far that his anxious relatives put their arms round him lest he should fall. Waving a handkerchief, he shouted:

“A pleasant journey to you, Herr Rackner.”

His voice rang like a boy’s. Never shall I forget that cheerful face, which contrasted so grimly with the careworn aspect of the passers-by in the street. The illusion I had helped to sustain made life good for him. Was it not Goethe who said:

“Collectors are happy creatures”?





BUCHMENDEL


HAVING just got back to Vienna, after a visit to an out-of-theway part of the country, I was walking home from the station when a heavy shower came on, such a deluge that the passers-by hastened to take shelter in doorways, and I myself felt it expedient to get out of the downpour. Luckily there is a cafe at almost every street corner in the metropolis, and I made for the nearest, though not before my hat was dripping wet and my shoulders were drenched to the skin. An old-fashioned suburban place, lacking the attractions (copied from Germany) of music and a dancing-floor to be found in the centre of the town; full of small shopkeepers and working folk who consumed more newspapers than coffee and rolls. Since it was already late in the evening, the air, which would have been stuffy anyhow, was thick with tobacco-smoke. Still, the place was clean and brightly decorated, had new satin-covered couches, and a shining cash-register, so that it looked thoroughly attractive. In my haste to get out of the rain I had not troubled to read its name-but what matter? There I rested, warm and comfortable, though looking rather impatiently through the blue-tinted window panes to see when the shower would be over, and I should be able to get on my way.

Thus I sat unoccupied, and began to succumb to that inertia which results from the narcotic atmosphere of the typical Viennese cafe. Out of this void, I scanned various individuals whose eyes, in the murky room, had a greyish look in the artificial light; I mechanically contemplated the young woman at the counter as, like an automaton, she dealt out sugar and a teaspoon to the waiter for each cup of coffee; with half an eye and a wandering attention I read the uninteresting advertisements on the walls—and there was something agreeable about these dull occupations. But suddenly, and in a peculiar fashion, I was aroused from what had become almost a doze. A vague internal movement had begun; much as a toothache sometimes begins, without one’s being able to say whether it is on the right side or the left, in the upper jaw or the lower. All I became aware of was a numb tension, an obscure sentiment of spiritual unrest. Then, without knowing why, I grew fully conscious. I must have been in this cafe once before, years ago, and random associations had awakened memories of the walls, the tables, the chairs, the seemingly unfamiliar smoke-laden room.

The more I endeavoured to grasp this lost memory, the more obstinately did it elude me; a sort of jellyfish glistening in the abysses of consciousness, slippery and unseizable. Vainly did I scrutinize every object within the range of vision. Certainly when I had been here before the counter had had neither marble top nor cash register; the walls had not been panelled with imitation rosewood; these must be recent acquisitions. Yet I had indubitably been here, more than twenty years back. Within these four walls, as firmly fixed as a nail driven up to the head in a tree, there slung a part of my ego, long since overgrown. Vainly I explored, not only the room, but my own inner man, to grapple the lost links. Curse it all, I could not plumb the depths!

It will be seen that I was becoming vexed, as one is always out of humour when one’s grip slips in this way, and reveals the inadequacy, the imperfections, of one’s spiritual powers. Yet I still hoped to recover the clue. A slender thread would suffice, for my memory is of a peculiar type, both good and bad; on the one hand stubbornly untrustworthy, and on the other incredibly dependable. It swallows the most important details, whether in concrete happenings or in faces, and no voluntary exertion will induce it to regurgitate them from the gulf. Yet the most trifling indication—a picture postcard, the address on an envelope, a newspaper cutting—will suffice to hook up what is wanted as an angler who has made a strike and successfully imbedded his hook reels in a lively, struggling, and reluctant fish. Then I can recall the features of a man seen once only, the shape of his mouth and the gap to the left where he had an upper eye-tooth knocked out, the falsetto tone of his laugh, and the twitching of the moustache when he chooses to be merry, the entire change of expression which hilarity effects in him. Not only do these physical traits rise before my mind’s eye, but I remember,years afterwards, every word the man said to me, and the tenor of my replies. But if I am to see and feel the past thus vividly, there must be some material link to start the current of associations. My memory will not work satisfactorily on the abstract plane.

I closed my eyes to think more strenuously, in the attempt to forge the hook which would catch my fish. In vain! In vain! There was no hook, or the fish would not bite. So fierce waxed my irritation with the inefficient and mulish thinking apparatus between my temples that I could have struck myself a violent blow on the forehead, much as an irascible man will shake and kick a penny-in-the-slot machine which when he has inserted his coin, refuses to render him his due.

So exasperated did I become at my failure, that I could no longer sit quiet, but rose to prowl about the room. The instant I moved, the glow of awakening memory began. To the right of the cash-register, I recalled, there must be a doorway leading into a windowless room, where the only light was artificial. Yes, the place actually existed. The decorative scheme was different, but the proportions were unchanged. A square box of a place, behind the bar—the card room. My nerves thrilled as I contemplated the furniture, for I was on the track, I had found the clue, and soon I should know all. There were two small billiard-tables, looking like silent ponds covered with green scum. In the corners, card-tables, at one of which two bearded men of professorial type were playing chess. Beside the iron stove, close to a door labelled“Telephone,” was another small table. In a flash, I had it! That was Mendel’s place, Jacob Mendel’s. That was where Mendel used to hang out, Buchmendel. I was in the Cafe Gluck! How could I have forgotten Jacob Mendel. Was it possible that I had not thought about him for ages, a man so peculiar as well nigh to belong to the Land of Fable, the eighth wonder of the world, famous at the university and among a narrow circle of admirers, magician of book-fanciers, who had been wont to sit there from morning till night, an emblem of bookish lore, the glory of the Cafe Gluck? Why had I had so much difficulty in hooking my fish? How could I have forgotten Buchmendel?

I allowed my imagination to work. The man’s face and form pictured themselves vividly before me. I saw him as he had been in the flesh, seated at the table with its grey marble top, on which books and manuscripts were piled. Motionless he sat, his spectacled eyes fixed upon the printed page. Yet not altogether motionless, for he had a habit (acquired at school in the Jewish quarter of the Galician town from which he came) of rocking his shiny bald pate backwards and forwards and humming to himself as he read, There he studied catalogues and tomes, crooning and rocking, as Jewish boys are taught to do when reading the Talmud. The rabbis believe that, just as a child is rocked to sleep in its cradle, so are the pious ideas of the holy text better instilled by this rhythmical and hypnotizing movement of head and body. In fact, as if he had been in a trance, Jacob Mendel saw and heard nothing while thus occupied. He was oblivious to the click of billiard-balls, the coming and going of waiters, the ringing of the telephone bell; he paid no heed when the floor was scrubbed and when the stove was refilled. Once a red-hot coal fell out of the latter, and the flooring began to blaze a few inches from Mendel’s feet; the room was full of smoke, and one of the guests ran for a pail of water to extinguish the fire. But neither the smoke, the bustle, nor the stench diverted his attention from the volume before him. He read as others pray, as gamblers follow the spinning of the roulette board, as drunkards stare into vacancy; he read with such profound absorption that ever since I first watched him the reading of ordinary mortals has seemed a pastime. This Galician second-hand book dealer, Jacob Mendel, was the first to reveal to me in my youth the mystery of absolute concentration which characterizes the artist and the scholar, the sage and the imbecile; the first to make me acquainted with the tragical happiness and unhappiness of complete absorption.

A senior student introduced me to him. I was studying the life and doings of a man who is even to-day too little known, Mesmer the magnetizer. My researches were bearing scant fruit, for the books I could lay my hands on conveyed sparse information, and when I applied to the university librarian for help he told me, uncivilly, that it was not his business to hunt up references for a freshman. Then my college friend suggested taking me to Mendel.

“He knows everything about books, and will tell you where to find the information you want. The ablest man in Vienna, and an original to boot. The man is a saurian of the book-world, an antediluvian survivor of an extinct species.”

We went, therefore, to the Cafe Gluck, and found Buchmendel in his usual place, bespectacled, bearded, wearing a rusty black suit, and rocking as I have described. He did not notice our intrusion, but went on reading, looking like a nodding mandarin. On a hook behind him hung his ragged black overcoat, the pockets of which bulged with manuscripts, catalogues, and books. My friend coughed loudly, to attract his attention, but Mendel ignored the sign. At length Schmidt rapped on the table-top, as if knocking at a door, and at this Mendel glanced up, mechanically pushed his spectacles on to his forehead, and from beneath his thick and untidy ashen-grey brows there glared at us two dark, alert little eyes. My friend introduced me, and I explained my quandary, being careful (as Schmidt had advised) to express great annoyance at the librarian’s unwillingness to assist me. Mendel leaned back, laughed scornfully, and answered with a strong Galician accent:

“Unwillingness, you think? Incompetence, that’s what’s the matter with him. He’s a jackass. I’ve known him (for my sins) twenty years at least, and he’s learned nothing in the whole of that time. Pocket their wages that’s all such fellows can do. They should be mending the road, instead of sitting over books.”

This outburst served to break the ice, and with a friendly wave of the hand the bookworm invited me to sit down at his table. I reiterated my object in consulting him; to get a list of all the early works on animal magnetism, and of contemporary and subsequent books and pamphlets for and against Mesmer. When I had said my say, Mendel closed his left eye for an instant, as if excluding a grain of dust. This was, with him, a sign of concentrated attention. Then, as though reading from an invisible catalogue, he reeled out the names of two or three dozen titles, giving in each case place and date of publication and approximate price. I was amazed, though Schmidt had warned me what to expect. His vanity was tickled by my surprise, for he went on to strum the keyboard of his marvellous memory, and to produce the most astounding bibliographical marginal notes. Did I want to know about sleepwalkers, Perkins’s metallic tractors, early experiments in hypnotism, Braid, Gassner, attempts to conjure up the devil, Christian Science, theosophy, Madame Blavatsky? In connexion with each item there was a hailstorm of book-names, dates and appropriate details. I was beginning to understand that Jacob Mendel was a living lexicon, something like the general catalogue of the British Museum Reading Room, but able to walk about on two legs. I stared dumbfounded at this bibliographical phenomenon, which masqueraded in the sordid and rather unclean domino of a Galician second-hand book dealer, who after rattling off some eighty titles (with assumed indifference but really with the satisfaction of one who plays an unexpected trump), proceeded to wipe his spectacles with a handkerchief which might long before have been white.

Hoping to conceal my astonishment, I inquired:

“Which among these works do you think you could get for me without too much trouble?”

“Oh, I’ll have a look round,” he answered. “Come here to-morrow and I shall certainly have some of them. As for the others, it’s only a question of time, and of knowing where to look.”

“I’m greatly obliged to you,” I said; and, then, wishing to be civil, I put my foot in it, proposing to give him a list of the books I wanted. Schmidt nudged me warningly, but too late. Mendel had already flashed a look at me—such a look, at once triumphant and affronted, scornful and overwhelmingly superior—the royal look with which Macbeth answers Macduff when summoned to yield without a blow. He laughed curtly. His Adam’s apple moved excitedly. Obviously he had gulped down a choleric, an insulting epithet.

Indeed he had good reason to be angry. Only a stranger, an ignoramus, could have proposed to give him, Jacob Mendel, a memorandum, as if he had been a bookseller’s assistant or an underling in a public library. Not until I knew him better did I fully understand how much my would-be politeness must have galled this aberrant genius—for the man had and knew himself to have, a titanic memory wherein, behind a dirty and undistinguished-looking forehead, was indelibly recorded a picture of the title-page of every book that had been printed. No matter whether it had issued from the press yesterday or hundreds of years ago, he knew its place of publication, its author’s name and its price. From his mind, as if from the printed page, he could read off the contents, could reproduce the illustrations; could visualize, not only what he had actually held in his hands, but also what he had glanced at in a bookseller’s window; could see it with the same vividness as an artist sees the creations of fancy which he has not yet reproduced upon canvas. When a book was offered for six marks by a Regensburg dealer, he could remember that, two years before, a copy of the same work had changed hands for four crowns at a Viennese auction and he recalled the name of the purchaser. In a word: Jacob Mendel never forgot a title or a figure; he knew every plant, every infusorian, every star, in the continually revolving and incessantly changing cosmos of the book-universe. In each literary speciality, he knew more than the specialists; he knew the contents of the libraries better than the librarians; he knew the book-lists of most publishers better than the heads of the firms concerned—though he had nothing to guide him except the magical powers of his inexplicable but invariably accurate memory.

True this memory owed its infallibility to the man’s limitations, to his extraordinary power of concentration. Apart from books, he knew nothing of the world. The phenomena of existence did not begin to become real for him until they had been set in type, arranged upon a composing stick, collected and, so to say, sterilized in a book. Nor did he read books for their meaning, to extract their spiritual or narrative substance. What aroused his passionate interest, what fixed his attention, was the name, the price, the format, the title-page Though in the last analysis unproductive and uncreative, this specifically antiquarian memory of Jacob Mendel, since it was not a printed book-catalogue but was stamped upon the grey matter of a mammalian brain, was, in its unique perfection, no less remarkable a phenomenon than Napoleon’s gift for physiognomy, Mezzofanti's talent for languages, Lasker’s skill at chess-openings, Busoni's musical genius. Given a public position as teacher, this man with so marvellous a brain might have taught thousands and hundreds of thousands of students, have trained others to become men of great learning and of incalculable value to those communal treasure-houses we call libraries. But to him, a man of no account, a Galician Jew, a book-pedlar whose only training had been received in a Talmudic school, this upper world of culture was a fenced precinct he could never enter; and his amazing faculties could only find application at the marble-topped table in the inner room of the Cafe Gluck. When, some day, there arises a great psychologist who shall classify the types of that magical power we term memory as effectively as Buffon classified the genera and species of animals, a man competent to give a detailed description of all the varieties, he will have to find a pigeon-hole for Jacob Mendel, forgotten master of the lore of bookprices and book-titles, the ambulatory catalogue alike of incunabula and the modern commonplace.

In the book-trade and among ordinary persons, Jacob Mendel was regarded as nothing more than a secondhand book dealer in a small way of business. Sunday after Sunday, his stereotyped advertisement appeared in the “Neue Freie Presse” and the “Neues Wiener Tagblatt.”It ran as follows: “Best prices paid for old books, Mendel, Obere Alserstrasse.” A telephone number followed, really that of the Cafe Gluck. He rummaged every available corner for his wares, and once a week, with the aid of a bearded porter, conveyed fresh booty to his headquarters, and got rid of old stock—for he had no proper bookshop. Thus he remained a petty trader, and his business was not lucrative. Students sold him their textbooks, which year by year passed through his hands from one “Generation” to another; and for a small percentage on the price he would procure any additional book that was wanted. He charged little or nothing for advice. Money seemed to have no standing in his world. No one had ever seen him better dressed than in the threadbare black coat. For breakfast and supper he had a glass of milk and a couple of rolls, while at midday a modest meal was brought him from a neighbouring restaurant. He did not smoke; he did not play cards; one might almost say he did not live, were it not that his eyes were alive behind his spectacles, and unceasingly fed his enigmatic brain with words, titles, names. The brain, like a fertile pasture, greedily sucked in this abundant irrigation. Human beings did not interest him, and of all human passions perhaps one only moved him, the most universal—vanity.

When someone, wearied by a futile hunt in countless other places, applied to him for information, and was instantly put on the track, his self-gratification was overwhelming; and it was unquestionably a delight to him that in Vienna and elsewhere there existed a few dozen persons who respected him for his knowledge and valued him for the services he could render. In every one of these monstrous aggregates we call towns, there are here and there facets which reflect one and the same universe in miniature—unseen by most, but highly prized by connoisseurs, by brethren of the same craft, by devotees of the same passion. The fans of the book-market knew Jacob Mendel. Just as anyone encountering a difficulty in deciphering a score would apply to Eusebius Mandyczewski of the Musical Society, who would be found wearing a grey skull-cap and seated among multifarious musical MSS., ready, with a friendly smile, to solve the most obstinate crux;and just as, to-day, anyone in search of information about the Viennese theatrical and cultural life of earlier times will unhesitatingly look up the polyhistor Father Glossy; so, with equal confidence did the bibliophiles of Vienna, when they had a particularly hard nut to crack, make a pilgrimage to the Cafe Gluck and lay their difficulty before Jacob Mendel.

To me, young and eager for new experiences, it became enthralling to watch such a consultation. Whereas ordinarily, when a would-be seller brought him some ordinary book, he would contemptuously clap the cover to and mutter, “Two crowns”; if shown a rare or unique volume, he would sit up and take notice, lay the treasure upon a clean sheet of paper; and, on one such occasion, he was obviously ashamed of his dirty, ink-stained fingers and mourning finger-nails. Tenderly, cautiously, respectfully, he would turn the pages of the treasure. One would have been as loath to disturb him at such a moment as to break in upon the devotions of a man at prayer; and in very truth there was a flavour of solemn ritual and religious observance about the way in which contemplation, palpation, smelling, and weighing in the hand followed one another in orderly succession. His rounded hack waggled while he was thus engaged, he muttered to himself, exclaimed “Ah”now and again to express wonder or admiration, or “Oh, dear” when a page was missing or another had been mutilated by the larva of a bookbeetle. His weighing of the tome in his hand was as circumspect as if books were sold by the ounce, and his snuffling at it as sentimental as a girl’s smelling of a rose. Of course it would have been the height of bad form for the owner to show impatience during this ritual of examination.

When it was over, he willingly, nay enthusiastically, tendered all the information at his disposal, not forgetting relevant anecdotes, and dramatized accounts of the prices which other specimens of the same work had fetched at auctions or in sales by private treaty. He looked brighter, younger, more lively at such times, and only one thing could put him seriously out of humour. This was when a novice offered him money for his expert opinion. Then he would draw back with an affronted air, looking for all the world like the skilled custodian of a museum gallery to whom an American traveller has offered a tip—for to Jacob Mendel contact with a rare book was something sacred, as is contact with a woman to a young man who has not had the bloom rubbed off. Such moments were his platonic love-nights. Books exerted a spell on him, never money. Vainly, therefore, did great collectors (among them one of the notables of Princeton University) try to recruit Mendel as librarian or book-buyer. The offer was declined with thanks. He could not forsake his familiar headquarters at the Cafe Gluck. Thirty-three years before, an awkward youngster with black down sprouting on his chin and black ringlets hanging over his temples, he had come from Galicia to Vienna, intending to adopt the calling of rabbi; but ere long he forsook the worship of the harsh and jealous Jehovah to devote himself to the more lively and polytheistic cult of books. Then he happened upon the Cafe Gluck, by degrees making it his workshop, headquarters, post-office—his world. Just as an astronomer, alone in an observatory, watches night after night through a telescope the myriads of stars, their mysterious movements, their changeful medley, their extinction and their flaming-up anew, so did Jacob Mendel, seated at his table in the Cafe Gluck, look through his spectacles into the universe of books, a universe that lies above the world of our everyday life, and, like the stellar universe, is full of changing cycles.

It need hardly be said that he was highly esteemed in the Cafe Gluck, whose fame seemed to us to depend far more upon his unofficial professorship than upon the godfathership of the famous musician, Christoph Willibald Gluck, composer of Alcestis and Iphigenia. He belonged to the outfit quite as much as did the old cherry wood counter, the two billiard-tables with their cloth stitched in many places, and the copper coffee-urn. His table was guarded as a sanctuary. His numerous clients and customers were expected to take a drink “For the good of the house,” so that most of the profit of his far-flung knowledge flowed into the big leathern pouch slung round the waist of Deubler, the waiter. In return for being a centre of attraction, Mendel enjoyed many privileges. The telephone was at his service for nothing. He could have his letters directed to the cafe, and his parcels were taken in there. The excellent old woman who looked after the toilet brushed his coat, sewed on buttons, and carried a small bundle of underlinen every week to the wash. He was the only guest who could have a meal sent in from the restaurant; and every morning Herr Standhartner, the proprietor of the cafe, made a point of coming to his table and saying “Good morning!”—though Jacob Mendel, immersed in his books, seldom noticed the greeting. Punctually at half-past seven he arrived, and did not leave till the lights were extinguished. He never spoke to the other guests, never read a newspaper, noticed no changes; and once, when Herr :Standhartner civilly asked him whether he did not find the electric light more agreeable to read by than the malodorous and uncertain kerosene lamps they had replaced, he stared in astonishment at the new incandescent bulbs. Although the installation had necessitated several days’ hammering and bustle, the introduction of the glow-lamps had escaped his notice. Only through the two round apertures of the spectacles, only through these two shining and sucking lenses, did the milliards of black infusorians which were the letters filter into his brain. Whatever else happened in his vicinity was disregarded as unmeaning noise. He had spent more than thirty years of his waking life at this table, reading, comparing, calculating, in a continuous waking dream, interrupted only by intervals of sleep.

A sense of horror overcame me when, looking into the inner room behind the bar of the Cafe Gluck, I saw that the marble-top of the table where Jacob Mendel used to deliver his oracles was now as bare as a tombstone. Grown older since those days, I understood how much disappears when such a man drops out of his place in the world, were it only because, amid the daily increase in hopeless monotony, the unique grows continually more precious. Besides, in my callow youth a profound intuition had made me exceedingly fond of Buchmendel. It was through the observation of him that I had first become aware of the enigmatic fact that supreme achievement and outstanding capacity are only rendered possible by mental concentration, by a sublime monomania that verges on lunacy. Through the living example of this obscure genius of a second-hand book dealer, far more than through the flashes of insight in the works of our poets and other imaginative writers, had been made plain to me the persistent possibility of a pure life of the spirit, of complete absorption in an idea, an ecstasy as absolute as that of an Indian yogi or a medieval monk; and I had learned that this was possible in an electric-lighted cafe and adjoining a telephone box. Yet I had forgotten him, during the war years, and through a kindred immersion in my own work. The sight of the empty table made me ashamed of myself, and at the same time curious about the man who used to sit there.

“What had become of him?” I called the waiter and inquired.

“No, Sir,” he answered, “I’m sorry, but I never heard of Herr Mendel. There is no one of that name among the frequenters of the Cafe Gluck. Perhaps the head-waiter will know.”

“Herr Mendel?” said the head-waiter dubiously, after a moment’s reflection. “No, Sir, never heard of him. Unless you mean Herr Mandl, who has a hardware store in the Florianigasse?”

I had a bitter taste in the mouth, the taste of an irrecoverable past. What is the use of living, when the wind obliterates our footsteps in the sand directly we have gone by? Thirty years, perhaps forty, a man had breathed, read, thought, and spoken within this narrow room;three or four years had elapsed, and there had arisen a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. No one in the Cafe Gluck had ever heard of Jacob Mendel, of Buchmendel. Somewhat pettishly I asked the headwaiter whether I could have a word with Herr Standhartner, or with one of the old Staff.

“Herr Standhartner, who used to own the place? He sold it years ago, and has died since....The former head-waiter? He saved up enough to retire, and lives upon a little property at Krems. No, Sir, all of the old lot are scattered. All except one, indeed, Frau Sporschil, who looks after the toilet. She’s been worked under the late owner, I know. likely to remember your Herr Mendel. hardly know one guest from another.”

I dissented in thought.

“One does not forget a Jacob Mendel so easily!”

What I said was:

“Still, I should like to have a word with Frau Sporschil, if she has a moment to spare.”

The “Toilettenfrau” (known in the Viennese vernacular as the“Schocoladefrau”) soon emerged from the basement, white-haired, run to seed, heavy-footed wiping her chapped hands upon a towel as she came. She had been called away from her task of cleaning up, and was obviously uneasy at being summoned into the strong light of the guestrooms—for common folk in Vienna, where an authoritative tradition has lingered on after the revolution, always think it must be a police matter when their “Superiors” want to question them. She eyed me suspiciously, though humbly. But as soon as I asked her about Jacob Mendel, she braced up, and at the same time her eyes filled with tears.

“Poor Herr Mendel...so there’s still someone who bears him in mind?”

Old people are commonly much moved by anything which recalls the days of their youth and revives the memory of past companionships. I asked if he was still alive.

“Good Lord, no. Poor Herr Mendel must have died five or six years ago. Indeed, I think it’s fully seven since he passed away. Dear, good man that he was; and how long I knew him, more than twentyfive years; he was already sitting every day at his table when I began to work here. It was a shame, it was the way they let him die.”

Growing more and more excited, she asked if I was a relative. Didn’t I know what had happened to him?

“No,” I replied, “And I want you to be good enough to tell me all about it.”

She looked at me timidly, and continued to wipe her damp hands. It was plain to me that she found it embarrassing, with her dirty apron and her tousled white hair, to be standing in the full glare of the cafe. She kept looking round anxiously, to see if one of the waiters might be listening.

“let’s go into the card-room,” I said, “Mendel’s old room. You shall tell me your story there.”

She nodded appreciatively, thankful that I understood and led the way to the inner room, a little shambling in her gait. As I followed, I noticed that the waiters and the guests were staring at us as a strangely assorted pair. We sat down opposite one another at the marble topped table, and there she told me the story of Jacob Mendel’s ruin and death. I will give the tale as nearly as may be in her own words, supplemented here and there by what I learned afterwards from other sources.

“Down to the outbreak of war, and after the war had begun, he continued to come here every morning at half past seven, to sit at this table and study all day just as before. We had the feeling that the fact of a war going on had never entered his mind. Certainly didn’t read the newspapers, and didn’t talk to anyone except about books. He paid no attention when (in the early days of the war, before the authorities put a stop to such things) the newspaper-vendors ran through the streets shouting, ‘Great Battle on the Eastern Front’ (or wherever it might be),‘Horrible Slaughter,’ and so on; when people gathered in knots to talk things over, he kept himself to himself; he did not know that Fritz, the billiard-marker, who fell in one of the first battles, had vanished from this place; he did not know that Herr Standhartner’s son had been taken prisoner by the Russians at Przemysl; never said a word when the bread grew more and more uneatable and when he was given bean-coffee to drink at breakfast and supper instead of hot milk. Once only did he express surprise at the changes, wondering why so few students came to the cafe. There was nothing in the world that mattered to him except his books.

“Then disaster befell him. At eleven one morning, two policemen came, one in uniform, and the other a plainclothes man. The latter showed the red rosette under the lapel of his coat and asked whether there was a man named Jacob Mendel in the house. They went straight to Herr Mendel’s table. The poor man, in his innocence, supposed they had books to sell, or wanted some information; but they told him he was under arrest, and took him away at once. It was a scandal for the cafe. All the guests flocked round Herr Mendel, as he stood between the two police officers, his spectacles pushed up under his hair, staring from each to the other bewildered. Some ventured a protest, saying there must be a mistake—that Herr Mendel was a man who wouldn’t hurt a fly; but the detective was furious, and told them to mind their own business. They took him away, and none of us at the Cafe Gluck saw him again for two years. I never found out what they had against him, but I would take my dying oath that they must have made a mistake. Herr Mendel could never have done anything wrong. It was a crime to treat an innocent man so harshly.”

The excellent Frau Sporschil was right. Our friend Jacob Mendel had done nothing wrong. He had merely (as I subsequently learned) done something incredibly stupid, only explicable to those who knew the man’s peculiarities. The military censorship board, whose function it was to supervise correspondence passing into and out of neutral lands, one day got its clutches upon a postcard written and signed by a certain Jacob Mendel, properly stamped for transmission abroad. This postcard was addressed to Monsieur Jean Labourdaire, Librairie, Quai de Grenelle, Paris—to an enemy country, therefore. The winter complained that the last eight issues of the monthly “Bulletin bibliographique de la France” had failed to reach him, although his annual subscription had been duly paid in advance. The jack-in-office who read this missive (a high-school teacher with a bent for the study of the Romance languages, called up for “War-service” and sent to employ his talents at the censorship board instead of wasting them in the trenches) was astonished by its tenor. “Must be a joke,” he thought. He had to examine some two thousand letters and postcards every week, always on the alert to detect anything that might savour of espionage, but never yet had he chanced upon anything so absurd as that an Austrian subject should unconcernedly drop into one of the imperial and royal letterboxes a postcard addressed to someone in an enemy land, regardless of the trifling detail that since August 1914 the Central Powers had been cut off from Russia on one side and from France on the other by barbed-wire entanglements and a network of ditches in which men armed with rifles and bayonets, machine-guns and artillery, were doing their utmost to exterminate one another like rats. Our schoolmaster enrolled in the Landsturm did not treat this first postcard seriously, but pigeon-holed it as a curiosity not worth talking about to his chief. But a few weeks later there turned up another card, again from Jacob Mendel, this time to John Aldridge, Bookseller, Golden Square, London, asking whether the addressee could send the last few numbers of the “Antiquarian” to an address in Vienna which was clearly stated on the card, The censor in the blue uniform began to feel uneasy. Was his “Class” trying to trick the schoolmaster? Were the cards written in cipher? Possible, anyhow; so the subordinate went over to the major’s desk, clicked his heels together, saluted, and laid the suspicious documents before“Properly constituted authority.” A strange business, certainly. The police were instructed by telephone to see if there actually was a Jacob Mendel at the specified address, and, if so, to bring the fellow along. Within the hour, Mendel had been arrested, and (still stupefied by the shock) brought before the major, who showed him the postcards, and asked him with drill sergeant roughness whether he acknowledged their authorship. Angered at being spoken to so sharply, and still more annoyed because his perusal of an important catalogue had been interrupted, Mendel answered tartly:

“Of course I wrote the cards. That’s my handwriting and signature. Surely one has a right to claim the delivery of a periodical to which one has subscribed?”

The major swung half-round in his swivel-chair and exchanged a meaning glance with the lieutenant seated at the adjoining desk.

“The man must be a double-distilled idiot,” was what they mutely conveyed to one another.

Then the chief took counsel within himself whether he should discharge the offender with a caution, or whether he should treat the case more seriously. In all offices, when such doubts arise, the usual practice is, not to spin a coin, but to send in a report. Thus Pilate washes his hands of responsibility. Even if the report does no good, it can do no harm, and is merely one useless manuscript or typescript added to a million others.

In this instance, however, the decision to send in a report did much harm, alas, to an inoffensive man of genius, for it involved asking a series of questions, and the third of them brought suspicious circumstances to light.

“Your full name?”

“Jacob Mendel.”

“Occupation ?”

“Book-pedlar” (for, as already explained, Mendel had no shop, but only a pedlar’s licence).

“Place of birth?”

Now came the disaster. Mendel’s birthplace was not far from Petrikau. The major raised his eyebrows. Petrikau, or Piotrkov, was across the frontier, in Russian Poland.

“You were born a Russian subject. When did you acquire Austrian nationality? Show me your papers.”

Mendel gazed at the officer uncomprehendingly through his spectacles.

“Papers? Identification papers? I have nothing but my hawker’s licence.”

“What’s’ your nationality, then? Was your father Austrian or Russian?”

Undismayed, Mendel answered:

“A Russian, of course.”

“What about yourself?”

“Wishing to evade Russian military service, I slipped across the frontier thirty-three years ago,

and ever since I have lived in Vienna.”

The matter seemed to the major to be growing worse and worse.

“But didn’t you take steps to become an Austrian subject?”

“Why should I?” countered Mendel. “I never troubled my head about such things.”

“Then you are still a Russian subject?”

Mendel, who was bored by this endless questioning, answered simply:

“Yes, I suppose I am.”

The startled and indignant major threw himself back in his chair with such violence that the wood cracked protestingly. So this was what it had come to! In Vienna, the Austrian capital, at the end of 1915, after Tarnow, when the war was in full blast, after the great offensive, a Russian could walk about unmolested, could write letters to France and England, while the police ignored his machinations. And then the fools who wrote in the newspapers wondered why Conrad von Hotzendorf had not advanced in seven-leagued boots to Warsaw, and the general staff was puzzled because every movement of the troops was immediately blabbed to the Russians.

The lieutenant had sprung to his feet and crossed the room to his chief’s table. What had been an almost friendly conversation took a new turn, and degenerated into a trial.

“Why didn’t you report as an enemy alien directly the war began?”

Mendel, still failing to realize the gravity of his position, answered in his singing Jewish jargon:

“Why should I report? I don’t understand.”

The major regarded this inquiry as a challenge, and asked threateningly:

“Didn’t you read the notices that were posted up everywhere ?”

“No.”

“Didn’t you read the newspapers?”

“No.”

The two officers stared at Jacob Mendel (now sweating with uneasiness) as if the moon had fallen from the sky into their office. Then the telephone buzzed, the typewriters clacked, orderlies ran hither and thither, and Mendel was sent under guard to the nearest barracks, where he was to await transfer to a concentration camp. When he was ordered to follow the two soldiers, he was frankly puzzled, but not seriously perturbed. What could the man with the gold-lace collar and the rough voice have against him? In the upper world of books, where Mendel lived and breathed and his being, there was no warfare, there were no misunderstandings, only an ever-increasing knowledge of words and figures, of book-titles and authors’ names. He walked good-humouredly enough downstairs between the soldiers, whose first charge was to take him to the police station. Not until, there, the books were taken out of his overcoat pockets, and the police impounded the portfolio containing a hundred important memoranda and customers’ addresses, did he lose his temper, and begin to resist and strike blows. They had to tie his hands. In the struggle, his spectacles fell off, and those magical telescopes, without which he could not see into the wonder world of books, were smashed into a thousand pieces. Two days later, insufficiently clad (for his only wrap was a light summer cloak), he was sent to the internment camp for Russian civilians at Komorn.

I have no information as to what Jacob Mendel suffered during these two years of internment, cut off from his beloved books, penniless, among roughly nurtured men, few of whom could read or write, in a huge human dunghill. This must be left to the imagination of those who can grasp the torments of a caged eagle. By degrees, however, our world, grown sober after its fit of drunkenness, has become aware that, of all the cruelties and wanton abuses of power during the war, the most needless and therefore the most inexcusable was this herding together behind barbed-wire fences of thousands upon thousands of persons who had outgrown the age of military service, who had made homes for themselves in a foreign land, and who (believing in the good faith of their hosts) had refrained from exercising the sacred right of hospitality granted even by the Tunguses and Araucanians-the right to flee while time permits. This crime against civilization was committed with the same unthinking hardihood in France, Germany, and Britain, in every belligerent country of our crazy Europe.

Probably Jacob Mendel would, like thousands as innocent as he, have perished in this cattle-pen, have gone stark mad, have succumbed to dysentery, asthenia, softening of the brain, had it not been that, before the worst happened, a chance (typically Austrian) recalled him to the world in which a spiritual life became again possible. Several times after his disappearance, letters from distinguished customers were delivered for him at the Cafe Gluck. Count Schonberg, sometime lord lieutenant of Styria, an enthusiastic collector of works on heraldry; Siegenfeld, the former dean of the theological faculty, who was writing a commentary on the works of St. Augustine; Edler von Pisek, an octogenarian admiral on the retired list, engaged in writing his memoirs—these and other persons of note, wanting information from Buchmendel, had repeatedly addressed communications to him at his familiar haunt, and some of these were duly forwarded to the concentration camp at Komorn. There they fell into the hands of the commanding officer, who happened to be a man of humane disposition, and was astonished to find what notables were among the correspondents of this dirty little Russian Jew, who, half-blind now that his spectacles were broken and he had no money to buy new ones, crouched in a corner like a mole, grey, eyeless, and dumb. A man who had such patrons must be a person of importance, whatever he looked like. The C.O. therefore read the letters to the short-sighted Mendel, and penned answers for him to sign—answers which were mainly requests that influence should be exercised on his behalf. The spell worked, for these correspondents had the solidarity of collectors. Joining forces and pulling strings they were able (giving guarantees for the “Enemy alien’s” good behaviour) to secure leave for Buchmendel’s return to Vienna in 1917, after more than two years at Komorn—on the condition that he should report daily to the police. The proviso mattered little. He was a free man once more, free to take up his quarters in his old attic, free to handle books again, free (above all) to return to his table in the Cafe Gluck. I can describe the return from the underworld of the camp in the good Frau Sporschil’s own words:

“One day—Jesus, Mary, Joseph; I could hardly believe my eyes—the door opened (you remember the way he had) little wider than a crack, and through this opening he sidled, poor Herr Mendel. He was wearing a tattered and much-darned military cloak, and his head was covered by what had perhaps once been a hat thrown away by the owner as past use. No collar. His face looked like a death’s head, so haggard it was, and his hair was pitifully thin. But he came in as if nothing had happened, went straight to his table, and took off his cloak, not briskly as of old, for he panted with the exertion. Nor had he any books with him. He just sat there without a word, staring straight in front of him with hollow, expressionless eyes. Only by degrees, after we had brought him the big bundle of printed matter which had arrived for him from Germany, did he begin to read again: But he was never the same man.”

No, he was never the same man, not now the miraculum mundi, the magical walking book-catalogue. All who saw him in those days told me the same pitiful story. Something had gone irrecoverably wrong;he was broken; the blood-red comet of the war had burst into the remote, calm atmosphere of his bookish world. His eyes, accustomed for decades to look at nothing but print, must have seen terrible sights in the wire-fenced human stockyard, for the eyes that had formerly been so alert and full of ironical gleams were now almost completely veiled by the inert lids, and looked sleepy and red-bordered behind the carefully repaired spectacle-frames. Worse still, a cog must have broken somewhere in the marvellous machinery of his memory, so that the working of the whole was impaired; for so delicate is the structure of the brain (a sort of switchboard made of the most fragile substances, and as easily jarred as are all instruments of precision) that a blocked arteriole, a congested bundle of nerve-fibres, a fatigued group of cells, even a displaced molecule, may put the apparatus out of gear and make harmonious working impossible. In Mendel’s memory, the keyboard of knowledge, the keys were stiff, or—to use psychological terminology—the associations were impaired. When, now and again, someone came to ask for information, Jacob stared blankly at the inquirer, failing to understand the question, and even forgetting it before he had found the answer. Mendel was no longer Buchmendel, just as the world was no longer the world. He could not now become wholly absorbed in his reading, did not rock as of old when he read, but sat bolt upright, his glasses turned mechanically towards the printed page, but perhaps not reading at all, and only sunk in a reverie. Often, said Frau Sporschil, his head would drop on to his book and he would fall asleep in the daytime, or he would gaze hour after hour at the stinking acetylene lamp which (in the days of the coal famine) had replaced the electric lighting. No, Mendel was no longer Buchmendel, no longer the eighth wonder of the world, but a weary, worn-out, though still breathing, useless bundle of beard and ragged garments, which sat, as futile as a potato-bogle, where of old the Pythian oracle had sat; no longer the glory of the Cafe Gluck, but a shameful scarecrow, evil-smelling, a parasite.

That was the impression he produced upon the new proprietor, Florian Gurtner from Retz, who (a successful profiteer in flour and butter) had cajoled Standhartner into selling him the Cafe Gluck for eighty thousand rapidly depreciating paper crowns. He took everything into his hard peasant grip, hastily arranged to have the old place redecorated, bought fine-looking satin-covered seats, installed a marble porch, an was in negotiation with his next-door neighbour to buy a place where he could extend the cafe into a dancing-hall. Naturally while he was making these embellishments, he was not best pleased by the parasitic encumbrance of Jacob Mendel, a filthy old Galician Jew, who had been in trouble with the authorities during the war, was still to be regarded as an “Enemy alien,” and, while occupying a table from morning till night, consumed no more than two cups of coffee and four or five rolls. Standhartner, indeed, had put in a word for this guest of long standing, had explained that Mendel was a person of note, and, in the stock-taking, had handed him over as having a permanent lien upon the establishment, but as an asset rather than a liability. Florian Gurtner, however, had brought into the cafe, not only new furniture, and an upto-date cash register, but also the profit-making and hard temper of the post-war era, and awaited the first pretext for ejecting from his smart coffee-house the last troublesome vestige of suburban shabbiness.

A good excuse was not slow to present itself. Jacob Mendel was impoverished to the last degree. Such banknotes as had been left to him had crumbled away to nothing during the inflation period; his regular clientele had been killed, ruined, or dispersed. When he tried to resume his early trade of book-pedlar, calling from door to door to buy and to sell, he found that he lacked strength to carry books up and down stairs. A hundred little signs showed him to be a pauper. Seldom, now, did he have a midday meal sent in from the restaurant, and he began to run up a score at the Cafe Gluck for his modest breakfast and supper. Once his payments were as much as three weeks overdue. Were it only for this reason, the head-waiter wanted Gurtner to “Give Mendel the sack.” But Frau Sporschil intervened, and stood surety for the debtor. What was due could be stopped out of her wages!

This staved off disaster for a while, but worse was to come. For some time the head-waiter had noticed that rolls were disappearing faster than the tally would account for. Naturally suspicion fell upon Mendel, who was known to be six months in debt to the tottering old porter whose services he still needed. The head-waiter, hidden behind the stove, was able, two days later, to catch Mendel red-handed. The unwelcome guest had stolen from his seat in the card-room, crept behind the counter in the front room, taken two rolls from the bread basket, returned to the card-room, and hungrily devoured them. When settling-up at the end of the day, he said he had only had coffee; no rolls. The source of wastage had been traced, and the waiter reported his discovery to the proprietor. Herr Gurtner, delighted to have so good an excuse for getting rid of Mendel, made a scene, openly accused him of theft, and declared that nothing but the goodness of his own heart prevented his sending for the police.

“But after this,” said Florian, “You’ll kindly take yourself off for good and all. We don’t want to see your face again at the Cafe Gluck.”

Jacob Mendel trembled, but made no reply. Abandoning his poor belongings, he departed without a word.

“It was ghastly,” said Frau Sporschil. “Never shall I forget the sight. He stood up, his spectacles pushed on to his forehead, and his face white as a sheet. He did not even stop to put on his cloak, although it was January, and very cold. You’ll remember that severe winter, just after the war. In his fright, he left the book he was reading open upon the table. I did not notice it at first, and then, when I wanted to pick it up and take it after him, he had already stumbled out through the doorway. I was afraid to follow him into the street, for Herr Gurtner was standing at the door and shouting at him, so that a crowd had gathered. Yet I felt ashamed to the depths of my soul. Such a thing would never have happened under the old master. Herr Standhartner would not have driven Herr Mendel away for pinching one or two rolls when he was hungry, but would have let him have as many as he wanted for nothing,to the end of his days. Since the war, people seem to have grown heartless. Drive away a man who had been a guest daily for so many, many years. Shameful! I should not like to have to answer before God for such cruelty!”

The good woman had grown excited, and, with the passionate garrulousness of old age, she kept on repeating how shameful it was, and that nothing of the sort would have happened if Herr Standhartner had not sold the business. In the end I tried to stop the flow by asking her what had happened to Mendel, and whether she had ever seen him again. These questions excited her yet more.

“Day after day, when I passed his table, it gave me the creeps, as you will easily understand. Each time I thought to myself: ‘where can he have got to, poor Herr Mendel?’ Had I known where he lived, I would have called and taken him something nice and hot to eat-for where could he get the money to cook food and warm his room? As far as I knew, he had no kinsfolk in the wide world. When, after a long time, I had heard nothing about him, I began to believe that it must be all up with him, and that I should never see him again. I had made up my mind to have a mass said for the peace of his soul, knowing him to be a good man, after twenty-five years’ acquaintance.

“At length one day in February, at half-past seven in the morning, when I was cleaning the windows, the door opened, and in came Herr Mendel. Generally, as you know, he sidled in, looking confused, and not ‘quite all there’; but this time, somehow, it was different. I noticed at once the strange look in his eyes; they were sparkling, and he rolled them this way and that, as if to see everything at once; as for his appearance, he seemed nothing but beard and skin and bone. Instantly it crossed my mind: ‘He’s forgotten all that happened last time he was here; it’s his way to go about like a sleepwalker noticing nothing; he doesn’t remember about the rolls, and how shamefully Herr Gurtner ordered him out of the place, half in mind to set the police on him.’ Thank goodness, Herr Gurtner hadn’t come yet, and the head-waiter was drinking coffee. I ran up to Herr Mendel, meaning to tell him he’d better make himself scarce, for otherwise that ruffian” [she looked round timidly to see if we were overheard, and hastily amended her phrase], “Herr Gurtner, I mean, would only have him thrown into the street once more. ‘Herr Mendel,’ I began. He started, and looked at me. In that very moment (it was dreadful), he must have remembered the whole thing, for he almost collapsed, and began to tremble, not his fingers only, but to shiver and shake from head to foot. Hastily he stepped back into the street, and fell in a heap on the pavement as soon as he was outside the door. We telephoned for the ambulance, and they carried him off to hospital, the nurse who came saying he had high fever directly she touched him. He died that evening. ‘double pneumonia,’ the doctor said, and that he never recovered consciousness—could not have been fully conscious when he came to the Cafe Gluck. As I said, he had entered like a man walking in his sleep. The table where he had sat day after day for thirty-six years drew him back to it like a home.”

Frau Sporschil and I went on talking about him for a long time, the two last persons to remember this strange creature, Buchmendel:I to whom in youth the book-pedlar from Galicia had given the first revelation of a life wholly devoted to the things of the spirit; she, the poor old woman who was caretaker of a cafe-toilet, who had never read a book in her life, and whose only tie with this strangely matched comrade in her subordinate, poverty-stricken world had been that for twenty-five years she had brushed his overcoat and had sewn on buttons for him. We, too, might have been considered strangely assorted, but Frau Sporschil and I got on very well together, linked, as we sat at the forsaken marble topped table, by our common memories of the shade our talk had conjured up—for joint memories, and above all loving memories, always establish a tie. Suddenly, while in the full stream of talk, she exclaimed:

“lord Jesus, how forgetful I am. I still have the book he left on the table the evening Herr Gurtner gave him the key of the street. I didn’t know where to take it. Afterwards, when no one appeared to claim it, I ventured to keep it as a souvenir. You don’t think it wrong of me, Sir?”

She went to a locker where she stored some of the requisites for her job: and produced the volume for my inspection. I found it hard to repress a smile, for I was face to face with one of life’s little ironies. It was the second volume of Hayn’s Bibliotheca Germanorum erotica et curiosa, a compendium of gallant literature known to every bookcollector. “Habent sua fata libelli!” This scabrous publication, as legacy of the vanished magician had fallen into toil worn hands which had perhaps never held any other printed work than a prayer-book. Maybe I was not wholly successful in controlling my mirth, for the expression on my race seemed to perplex the worthy soul, and once more she said:

“You don t think it wrong of me to keep it, Sir?”

I shook her cordially by the hand.

“Keep it, and welcome,” I said. “I am absolutely sure that our old friend Mendel would be only too delighted to know that someone among the many thousands he has provided with books, cherishes his memory.”

Then I took my departure, feeling a trifle ashamed when I compared myself with this excellent old woman, who, so simply and so humanely, had fostered the memory of the dead scholar. For she, uncultured though she was, had at least preserved a book as a memento;whereas I, a man of education and a writer, had completely forgotten Buchmendel for years—I, who at least should have known that one only makes books in order to keep in touch with one’s fellows after one has ceased to breathe, and thus to defend oneself against the inexorable fate of all that lives—transitoriness and oblivion.





LEPORELLA


CRESCENTIA ANNA ALOISIA FINKENHUBER was thirty-nine years of age, and had been born (an illegitimate child) in a mountain hamlet not far from Innsbruck. Under the rubric “Special Peculiarities”in her identity paper as servant-maid was drawn a line signifying“None”; but if the officials who fill in such documents were obliged to enter characterological details, there would certainly have been written here: “looks like an over-driven, bony, lean mountain nag.” Beyond question there was something horse-like in the aspect of the cumbrous lower lip; in the elongated and sharply bounded oval of the brownish visage; in the dull eyes almost denuded of lashes; and, above all, in the coarse hair, plastered on to the forehead with pomade. Her gait, too, was as stiff and reluctant as that of a mule, one of those unhappy beasts which winter after summer and summer after winter, have to carry loads of wood up and down the same rough and stony or muddy track way. When freed from the halter of toil, Crescenz, clasping her bony fingers and sticking out her elbows in ungainly fashion, would usually sit down and fall into a doze, no more lightened by intelligence than that of one of the aforesaid mules standing patiently in its stable when the day’s work was done. Everything about her was hard, wooden and heavy. Thought, with her, was a slow process. A new idea made its way into her mind with much difficulty, as if it had to traverse the meshes of a choked sieve; but, once she had grasped it, she retained it as a miser clings to a coin. She never read, not even the newspaper or her prayerbook. Writing was a great labour to her, and the awkwardly-formed letters in her marketing-book reminded one of her own clumsy and angular figure, which was utterly lacking in feminine charm. As hard as her bones, her forehead, her hips, and her knuckles, was her voice, which, despite the guttural Tyrolese accent, creaked like the hinges of a rusty iron gate. Nor was this rustiness surprising, for Crescenz never uttered a superfluous word. No one had seen her laugh. In this respect, likewise, she resembled the lower animals; for more cruel even than the denial of speech to those we term “Dumb beasts” is the denial of laughter, that free and joyful vent to the emotions.

Being a bastard, she had been brought up at the charge of the community, and at the age of twelve had been sent out to service, at first as maid-of-all-work in a restaurant; but then, having gained a good character by her indomitable and almost bestial diligence, as cook-general to a second-rate hotel on one of the main routes of travel. Rising daily at five, Crescenz slaved, swept, scrubbed, did the rooms, lighted fires, cooked, kneaded and baked, washed and ironed, till late at night. She never asked for a day out; never went into the street, except to church and back. The kitchen-fire was her sun, and her only acquaintance with the forest came from splitting thousands upon thousands of billets every year in order to feed the flames.

Men did not trouble her: maybe because, as previously explained, twenty-five years spent as a robot had rubbed off the very inadequate feminine graces which Mother Nature had bestowed on her; maybe because she so fiercely repelled any amorous advances. Her only pleasure was found in the amassing of money, for she had the magpie hoarding-instincts of the peasant, and dreaded lest, when she grew old, she would once more be forced to accept the unwelcome lot of being dependent upon the community. The bitter bread of public charity would have choked her.

Nothing but the lust for gain had, when she was thirty-seven lured this dull being from her Tyrolese homeland. The manageress of an employment agency, spending a summer holiday in the Tyrol, was amazed by Crescenz’s berserker rage for work, and told her that in Vienna she could get twice her present earnings.

On the railway journey, Crescenz maintained her usual taciturnity, seated in solemn silence while holding in her lap the wicker basket which contained all her worldly possessions, though her knees ached beneath its weight. Some of her fellow-travellers, friendly and companionable, offered to put it in the rack, but the dour woman snapped a refusal, for, in her peasant mind, cheating and theft were the only associations with the great city to which she was journeying. In Vienna it was some days before she could make her way alone to market, for at first the traffic frightened her almost out of her poor wits. But once she had grown familiar with the four streets she had to traverse, she became independent, and trotted safely to the market and back carrying a basket on her arm. In her new place, she swept, scrubbed, lighted the fires, and did the rooms, just as before. At nine, the customary hour in the Tyrol, she went to bed, and slept like an animal with her mouth wide open, until she was called in the morning. No one could tell whether she liked her new situation; perhaps she herself did not know. Her reserve was unbroken. She acknowledged orders with a monosyllabic “Right” ; or, if in a refractory mood with a shrug of the shoulders. She ignored her fellow-servants, being, as a rule absolutely indifferent to their inclination to tease and to make fun of her. Once only, when another maid, a cheerful Viennese girl, persistently mocked her Tyrolese accent, Crescenz lost patience. In a fury she snatched a burning log from the stove, and, brandishing this dangerous weapon, rushed at her tormentress, who fled shrieking with dismay. Thenceforward no one ventured to gibe.

Every Sunday morning, dressed in her voluminous skirt and wearing a Tyrolese head-dress, she went to Mass. Once only, being given a day off, she tried a walk through Vienna. She would not take a tram, and her peregrinations in the bewildering streets brought her, at length, to the Danube. After staring at the current as if it were a familiar friend, she turned about and retraced her steps, sedulously avoiding the busier highways. This first excursion must have been a disappointment, for it was never repeated. She preferred to spend her free Sundays doing needlework, or sitting idly at a window. Thus her coming to the metropolis wrought no change in the treadmill of her life, except that at the end of each month four blue bank notes instead of two were put into her toilworn, withered, and calloused hands. These notes were always suspiciously scrutinized. Each was separately folded and smoothed out, before being stacked with the others and laid to rest in the yellow box of carved wood which she had brought with her from the village. This clumsy little treasure-chest contained the innermost purpose of her life.At night she always had the key under her pillow. No one in the house knew where it was kept in the daytime.

Such were the characteristics of this weird human being (for“Human being” we must call her, although the human attributes were queerly obscured); and perhaps a more normal woman could not have long endured to stay as a servant in the remarkable household of young Baron von Ledersheim. The atmosphere was so quarrelsome that in general the domestics were quick to give notice. The hysterical scoldings of their mistress were more than they could bear. The elderly daughter of an more extremely rich manufacturer, she had made the baron’s acquaintance at a health-resort. Though he was many years younger than herself, and his birth was nothing to boast of, while he was up to his ears in debt he was a handsome fellow, with distinguished manners and willing enough to marry money. Things were speedily arranged between the pair, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the lady’s parents, who were on the look-out for more solid advantages than Baron von Ledersheim could offer. Before the honeymoon was over, Baroness von Ledersheim was to learn that her father and mother had been right. The young husband had by no means finished sowing his wild oats, and was more interested in this form of agriculture than in the fulfillment of his conjugal duties. Nor had he even made a clean breast of it as to the amount of his debts.

Good-natured in a way, a pleasant companion like most libertines, he had no principles, and considered any attempt to regulate his expenditure to be the outcome of plebeian prejudices. The husband wanted to remain a dissolute spendthrift, after marriage as before; the wife wanted an orderly domestic life such as she had been used to in her parental home at Essen. This bourgeoisdom jarred on his aristocratic nerves. Since, wealthy though she was, she tried to draw the pursestrings tight, and refused to finance his pet scheme of building and running a racing-stable, his response to her “Meanness” was, as far as husbandly relations went, to ignore his North-German bride, whose dictatorial ways and harsh voice became increasingly offensive to him. As the saying goes, he “Shelved” her, without obvious brutality, but in a way which caused her grievous disappointment. When she reproached him he listened courteously and with apparent sympathy, but as soon as the sermon was over he blew away her exhortations as unconcernedly as the smoke of his cigarette, and continued to follow his own bent. This seeming amiability was more galling than open resistance. Since she was disarmed by his unfailing civility, her suppressed wrath found vent in other directions, and, above all, in railing at the servants, with reason or without. In less than two years, she had changed her domestic staff no less than sixteen times, having once used violence, and had to pay heavy compensation in order to avoid a lawsuit and public scandal.

Crescenz was the only one of the servants who could endure these storms of scolding unmoved, and stood stolidly while they raged, looking like a cab-horse in the rain. She never took sides, was unaffected by the frequent changes in the staff, hardly seemed to notice that her associates in the servants’ hall varied continually in name, aspect, and character. For she never passed the time of day with her workmates, was indifferent to the passionate slamming of doors, the frequent interruptions at mealtimes, her mistress’s fainting-fits and hysterical outbursts. She went on with her daily marketing expeditions and her work in the kitchen, unconcerned as to anything that happened outside the daily round of toil. Hard and insensitive as a flail, she threshed on as day followed day, and two years of her life in the metropolis passed by without effecting the slightest change in her mentality. As far as externals were concerned, the only difference to be noticed was that the pile of blue banknotes in her cash box had grown thicker by an inch;and that, when (licking her finger to facilitate the process) she counted them at the second year’s end, she found she was very close to the aim of her desire, the magical figure of a thousand.

But chance works with diamond-drills; and fate, cunning of hand, often produces strange modifications even in the rockiest of natures. In Crescenz’s case the manifest cause of change was as commonplace as she herself seemed. At the close of a ten-year cycle, the government was taking a new census and a complicated census-paper had to be filled in every dwelling-home. The baron, who had good reason to know that most of his domestics were unskilled in the use of the pen, decided to tabulate the information himself, and, in due course, Crescenz was summoned to his writing-table. When he asked her full name, age, and birthplace, the first item and the third proved of unexpected interest to the master of the house. A keen sportsman, he had often stayed with an old college-friend who was the owner of a Tyrolese shooting; and he had once done a fortnight’s mountaineering in pursuit of chamois, accompanied by a guide, Finkenhuber by name, who turned out to have been Crescenz’s uncle. Ledersheim had taken a fancy to the man. This fact, and his knowledge of the cook’s native village, led to a conversation between master and maid, with the resulting further disclosure that, in the inn where she had formerly worked, the baron had once partaken of an extraordinarily good haunch of venison. Trifling matters, no doubt; but the long arm of coincidence handles such trifles, and to Crescenz who for the first time encountered in Vienna a person acquainted with her home, they seemed wonderful. Her face flushed with unwonted excitement, she stood in front of the baron, curtseying in ungainly fashion, and highly flattered when he proceeded to crack jokes with her, asking her with an assumed Tyrolese accent, whether she knew how to yodel—and the like. At length entering into the spirit of the game, he spanked her with peasant familiarity on her hard behind, saying: “Be off with you now, my good Cenzi, and let me get on with my job; but take these two extra crowns with you because you hail from the Zillertal.”

The master had not shown any deep feeling. Nothing, one might have thought, to stir the old maid to the depths. But on her dull and unimpressionable nature those few minutes’ talk had the effect of a stone thrown into a stagnant pool, forming circular waves which moved, slowly widening, to lap upon the margin of consciousness. Not for years upon years had the taciturn creature had any sort of personal relations with one of her fellows; and it seemed to her almost uncanny that the first to show a friendly interest in her, from among the millions who lived in this wilderness of bricks and mortar, should be a man who knew her own mountains, and had actually eaten venison cooked there by her own hands. Super added came the clout upon the backside, which, to her peasant mind was a laconic invitation to the woman in her. Even though Crescenz did not make so bold as to fancy that the elegantly dressed and distinguished gentleman actually coveted her wizened body, still the physical familiarity stirred her slumbering senses.

Thus, thanks to this encounter, there began in the woman’s inmost being a transformation, obscure at the outset, but growing continually more definite—and culminating in a new feeling, akin to that sudden recognition which leads a dog to single out one from among the innumerable bipeds that surround it, and to look upon him thenceforward as master, nay as god. The dog thus transformed follows its master everywhere, wriggles with delight and wags a friendly tail when meeting him again after an absence, obeys, fetches, and carries with slavish subservience. Into the narrow chambers of Crescenz’s mind, which had hitherto been completely filled with a bare half-dozen of ideas—money, marketing, kitchen-fire, church, and bed—there had suddenly been thrust a new element, which demanded accommodation, and roughly elbowed the previous occupants aside. With the “Havingness” that makes the peasant so reluctant to surrender anything that has once been gripped, she interpolated this new element sedulously into the confused world of her lethargic impulses. It was a little while, of course, before the change in her habits became fully manifest, and the initial signs of the transformation were obscure. For instance, she brushed the baron’s clothes and cleaned his shoes with meticulous care, while leaving the baroness’s dresses and footgear to the lady’s maid to look after. Then she would often scurry forth into the hall the instant she heard the baron’s latch-key in the lock, eager to relieve him of hat, coat, and stick. In the kitchen, she worked harder than ever, and would sometimes laboriously ask her way to the big market, in search of a haunch of venison. She also began to pay more attention to the niceties of dress.

A week or two elapsed before this first shoot of her new feelings showed its leaves plainly above the ground. Several more weeks were needed until a second shoot pushed up from the seedling, and assumed a definite tint. The second feeling was the obvious complement of the first, hatred for the baroness, for the wife who could live with the baron, sleep with him, speak to him whenever she pleased, but nevertheless did not revere the master as she herself, Cenzi, did. It may have been because (having now learned to take notice) she had been shocked by one of the scenes in which the infuriated wife “Slanged” her husband unmercifully, or it may have been because she had become aware how painfully the cold and arrogant manners of the North German mistress contrasted with the geniality of the Viennese master of the house—in any case Crescenz began, in manifold ways, to show that she had conceived a spite against the baroness. Brigitta von Ledersheim had always to ring twice, at least, before Crescenz would deign to answer the bell; and then the maid came with irritating slowness and obvious reluctance. Her raised shoulders produced the same impression as the turning back of its ears by a stubborn and vicious horse, a conviction of insuperable antagonism. She said nothing in response to her mistress’s orders, so that the baroness never knew whether she had been understood and would be obeyed. A repetition produced only a contemptuous nod, or a “I heard you all right,” in her broad peasant accent. Again, just before a visit to the theater, when the mistress was dressing, the key of a drawer containing some indispensable trinket would have gone astray—to be discovered in a corner of the room after half an hour’s frantic search. Crescenz made a point of failing to deliver telephone messages to the baroness, and when scolded for the omission would pertly reply “I just forgot.” She never looked her mistress squarely in the face, perhaps, from fear lest her loathing should peep out.

Meanwhile these domestic discomforts led to continually more violent scenes between husband and wife—for there can be little doubt that the maid’s state of mind and uncivil manners reacted on the mistress to increase the latter’s uncontrol. Brigitta’s nerves had been overstrained by too long a period of spinsterhood; she had been further embittered by her husband’s neglect and by her failure to hit it off even with her servants; so that she now grew more and more unbalanced. The bromides and the veronal she took to relieve insomnia made matters worse; but no one sympathized with the poor woman in her nervous crises, or tried to help her to live more hygienically and to regain selfmastery. A neurologist whom she consulted advised a couple of months’ stay in a sanatorium, and her husband endorsed the proposal with such injudicious enthusiasm that the baroness at first refused to consider it. In the end, however, she gave way. She would take the lady’s maid with her, while Crescenz would be left alone to look after the baron in the roomy flat.

The news that the care of her beloved master was to be left wholly in her hands had an electrifying effect on Crescenz. She seemed to have been given the contents of a magic phial—a philtre which stirred the lees of her undischarged passions and modified her behaviour. Her limbs were no longer stiff and ungainly; she moved lightly, easily, and swiftly. When the time came for the baroness’s journey, the maid ran from room to room, packed the trunks without waiting to be told, shouldered them like a porter, and carried them down to the cab. When, late in the evening, the baron returned from seeing his wife off at the station, handed hat and overcoat to the expectant Crescenz, and, with a sigh of relief, said: “Well, I’ve got her safely away!”—a remarkable thing happened. Crescenz, as already explained, resembled the lower animals, in that she never laughed. But now her lips were animated by an unfamiliar phenomenon. Her mouth broadened into a grin so unrestrained that Ledersheim, to whom the awkward servant maid’s expression of countenance came as a painful surprise, felt ashamed of having been so open with a menial, and went into his bedroom without saying another word.

The discomfort lasted for a fleeting moment, and during the next few days master and maidservant were united in the enjoyment of a precious sense of quietude and agreeable ease. The wife’s exit from the scene had cleared the atmosphere. Rudolf freed from the burden of responsibility, and from the perpetual risk of being called to account for his movements came home late next evening, and Crescenz’s silent adoration was a welcome contrast to the loquacious inquisitiveness with which Brigitta was wont to receive him. Crescenz devoted herself to her work with more than customary zeal, got up earlier than usual, polished the furniture till you could see your face in it, was never satisfied with the brightness of the door-handles, provided exceptionally tasty meals—and, greatly to the baron’s surprise, served them on a dinner-set which was supposed to be kept for great occasions. Though as a rule he was blind to such matters, he could not but notice the peculiar and delicate attentions of this strange maidservant, and, being a good-natured fellow at bottom, he expressed his gratification. He praised her culinary skill, and, in a day or two, when his birthday came round and Crescenz had made him a jam tart in which the pastry was decorated with his initials and the family coat-of-arms, he said with a smile: “You are spoiling me, Cenzi. But what the devil shall I do when the mistress comes home again?”

To the inhabitants of other lands, such free and easy ways, such want of reserve in the remarks of a master to a servant, may seem incredible, but there was nothing out of the ordinary in them as far as pre-war Austria was concerned. They were, in fact, manifestations of the boundless contempt of the aristocracy for the mob, a contempt in witness whereof the gentry rode with a loose rein. Just as an archduke, stationed in some out-of-the-way Galician town, would send his orderly to the brothel to fetch him a bedfellow, and having satisfied his desires, would hand the girl over to the underling—regardless of the salacious gossip that would ensue when the cits got wind of the affair—so a man of title who was out shooting would be more inclined to hobnob over luncheon with his loader or his groom, than to be friendly with a university professor or a wealthy man of business. But these ostensibly democratic relationships, easy-going though they seemed, must not be taken at their face value; the master remained the master, and knew how to keep his distance once more, the instant he rose from his meal. Since, however, the minor gentry were always inclined to ape the manners of the feudal aristocracy, the baron made no bones about speaking derogatorily of his wife to a country wench who was in her service, assured that she would never give him away but failing to realize what a profound impression his words were producing in her simple mind.

All the same, he imposed some vestiges of restraint upon his tongue and his general behaviour for a few days. Then feeling confident that he could trust her, he began, unheeding dangerous possibilities, to resume bachelor habits. This was his own house, his wife was away, and he could amuse himself as he pleased. One day towards the close of the first week he spent as a grasswidower, he rang for Crescenz, and,as if the matter were of no moment, told her that that evening she was to lay a cold supper for two, and to go to bed without waiting up for his return. He would himself see to everything when he came in.

“Very good, Sir,” answered Crescenz, without the smallest change of expression to show that she understood what lay behind. But that she was sharper of wit than she seemed was plain to the amused Rudolf when, returning towards midnight accompanied by one of the young ladies of the opera, he found the supper-table decked with flowers;and, on going into his bedroom, discovered, not only that his own bed had been made ready as usual, but that the adjoining bed had been invitingly turned down, and that one of his wife’s silk nightgowns and her slippers were laid out ready for use. The husband whose marriage vows sat so lightly on his conscience could not but laugh at the length to which this extraordinary abigail was prepared to go in her attentions. Thenceforward she was his acknowledged confederate, and next morning he had no hesitation in ringing for Crescenz to act as lady’s maid to his light-of-love.

It was at this juncture that Crescenz was rechristened. The budding diva was understudy for the role of Donna Elvira, and found it congenial to call her lover Don Juan. On her next visit to the flat, she said merrily:

“Don Juan, I wish you’d send for that Leporella of yours.”

The name took his fancy, were it only for the reason that it was too grotesquely misapplicable to the withered Tyrolese peasantwoman, and from that time on he always addressed her as Leporella. Crescenz, though startled at first by her new appellation, accepted it as a compliment. She knew nothing of its Don Giovannesque associations, but it was euphonious to her untutored ears and her vanity was tickled that her master should give her a pet-name. Whenever she heard the impudent call “leporella!” her thin lips parted in a smile that showed her horse-like teeth; and, obsequiously, she hastened to fulfil the commands of her liege lord.

The name had been lightly chosen, and I have called it misapplicable. Nevertheless, it hit the mark, for “leporella,” like her namesake Leporello, was a sympathetic accomplice. An old maid who had known nothing of love, she took a vicarious pride in her lusty young master’s adventures. No matter whether the delight came from knowing that the detested baroness’s bed was dishonoured almost every night by some new illicit occupant, or from an imaginary participation in these sensuous pleasures—there could be no question as to its existence. Her bony frame, wasted and wizened by decades of arduous toil until it had been almost completely desexualized, thrilled with bawdy pleasure at sight of a second and then a third fleeting occupant of Baroness von Ledersheim’s rightful couch. Her confederateship and the unfamiliar erotic atmosphere were powerful stimulants to her slumbering senses. Crescenz became really and truly Leporella, became, like Leporello in Da Ponte’s libretto, vigorous and sprightly. Un-accustomed qualities, stirred up from the depths by this ardent co-partnership came to the surface, petty wiles and artifices, an inclination to spy and eavesdrop. She listened at the door, squinted through the keyhole, buzzed eagerly hither and thither, until her curiosity and alertness transformed what had been little better than an automaton into living flesh and blood. To the astonishment of the neighbours, Crescenz became sociable;she gossiped with the servants, cracked jokes with the postman, began to talk of miscellaneous subjects with the market-women. Then, one evening, when the lights in the attic (where the servants’ quarters were) had been extinguished, the maids in the rooms on the opposite side of the court heard a remarkable humming from her window usually so silent. Clumsily, mezzo voce, she was singing one of those folk-songs which dairymaids sing in Alpine pastures. Monotonously she produced the air, with untrained lips and vocal cords, like a child fingering the keys of a neglected piano-the effect being simultaneously touching and repulsive. Not since early youth had she tried to sing, but now something that came from the darkness of forgotten years seemed to be struggling towards the light.

This extraordinary transformation was least obvious to the man who had brought it about—for who troubles to notice his own shadow? We see, of course, with half an eye, how it dogs our footsteps, or sometimes runs in advance (like a wish of which we are not yet fully aware); but how rarely do we heed its parody of our form, or recognize in it a caricature of our personality. All that Ledersheim noticed in Crescenz was that she seemed ever ready to serve him diligently, silently, and self-sacrificingly. Her mute worship was agreeable to him. From time to time, as if patting a dog, he said a friendly word or two; sometimes he jested with her, took her good-naturedly by the ear, gave her a banknote or a theatre ticket-trifles he extracted from his waistcoat-pocket, but, for her, treasures of inestimable value, which she hoarded as relics in her cashbox. Gradually it became a habit with him to think aloud in her presence, and even to entrust her with difficult commissions; and the more marked these signs of his confidence, the more slavish became her devotion. She tried to anticipate his desires;to enter into his being as the executant of his will; to see with his eyes, hear with his ears; to enjoy his pleasures and share in his conquests. She beamed when a new bedfellow accompanied him on his return, and was visibly disappointed if he came back alone. Her brain now worked as unceasingly as aforetime her hands had done, and a new light of understanding sparkled in her eyes. The overdriven beast of burden had developed into a human being; though still reserved, tight-lipped, crafty, and dangerous, meditative and much occupied, restless and rancorous.

Once, when the baron came home earlier than usual, he was amazed on entering the hall to hear from behind the door of the kitchen, where inviolable silence usually prevailed, the noise of sniggering. The door was half-open, and in the aperture Leporella showed herself, rubbing her hands on her apron, simultaneously cheeky and embarrassed.

“Beg pardon, Sir, for being so free,” she said, with downcast eyes;“But I’ve got the pastrycook’s daughter in there; she’s such a pretty girl, and she’d be main glad to make your acquaintance.”

Ledersheim stared at Crescenz, not knowing whether to reject these impudent advances forthwith, or whether to grasp at the skirts of happy chance and accept the impromptu bawd’s offer. In the end, desire stirred within him, and got the upper hand.

“let’s have a look at the beauty,” he replied.

The girl, a fair-haired hussy of sixteen, whom Leporella had limed with flattering tales, emerged from the kitchen, blushing and giggling, and, revolving awkwardly showed off her charms to the stylish gentleman whom she had often furtively admired from the shop across the way. The baron was pleased with her looks, and invited her to drink tea with him in his room. She glanced towards Crescenz for a pointer, but Crescenz had vanished, and the pastrycook’s daughter, thus inveigled into an adventure, inquisitive and excited (for all her blushes and embarrassment), felt she had no option out to accept the invitation.“Will you walk into my parlour?” said the spider to the fly!

But nature makes no leaps. Although, under stress of a warped passion, a measure of spiritual mobility had resulted in this ossified personality, the new but limited thought-processes did not enable Crescenz to look ahead. She remained as unimaginative as the lower animals, whose actions are guided by short-sighted instincts. Concerned only with the longing to serve the master whom she loved with the fidelity of a dog, she completely forgot the absent wife. It came, therefore, like a bolt from the blue when, one morning the baron with knitted brows and holding a letter in his hand entered the kitchen and told her to devote the day to a general house-cleaning, for next afternoon his wife would be back from the sanatorium. Crescenz turned livid at the news, standing open-mouthed with the horrified aspect of one who has been stabbed. She stared dumbly at her master, until the baron, wishing her to pull herself together, said:

“You don’t look best pleased Cenzi; but there’s nothing we can do about the matter!”

At this her rigid countenance began to stir, as though something were at work in the depths. A wave seemed to rise from her inwards, and her pale cheeks flushed dark red. Her throat twitched, and, with immense difficulty she got out the words:

“After all...one might...one might...surely...”

She choked, and did not finish the sentence. Her face was contorted with malice, and so sinister was her expression, that it was Ledersheim’s turn to be frightened, and he shrank back in alarm. But Crescenz had resumed her work, and was scouring a copper saucepan with a violence that threatened to take the skin off her fingers.

With the return of the mistress, the sense of comfort that had prevailed during her absence was dispelled. Once more began the regime of banging doors and causeless scoldings. Maybe some of the neighbours had sent her anonymous letters to inform her of her husband’s “Goings-on” during her absence, or maybe the lack of warmth in his welcome had been enough to disclose the state of his feelings; in any case, she seemed worse instead of better for her two months’ treatment, since outbursts of weeping alternated with menaces and hysterical scenes. The relations between the couple grew more intolerable day by day. For a few weeks the baron confronted the storm of reproaches, answering evasively and consolingly, with his habitual civility, when she threatened to sue for a divorce or to write to her parents. But this indifferent attitude had an evil effect upon her. She was beginning to believe herself surrounded by secret enemies, and her nervous excitement verged upon persecution mania.

Crescenz had put on her old armour of silence. But now this silence became aggressive and menacing. When her mistress returned, she remained in the kitchen, from which she would not emerge even when summoned to welcome the baroness home. She stood like a figure carved out of wood, her shoulders raised stubbornly, giving such curt answers to questions that the impatient mistress soon ceased asking any and turned away, while Crescenz glared at her unsuspecting back with venom and hatred. Her avarice made her feel that she had been robbed by this return of the mistress of the house, had been deprived of the joys of companionable service and thrust back to toil in the kitchen, while her pet-name of Leporella had been stolen from her. For the baron was careful, in his wife’s presence, to avoid showing any marks of sympathy for Crescenz. Now and again, however, exhausted by the scenes the baroness made, and wanting to draw a breath of relief, he would steal into the kitchen, plump down on one of the hard wooden stools, and exclaim with a groan:

“I can’t stand it any longer!”

These moments in which her idolized master sought refuge in her sympathy were the happiest known to Leporella. She never dared to answer or to attempt consolation, but remained dumb, while looking compassionately at her enslaved god. This soundless sympathy did Ledersheim good for a time. But as soon as he left the kitchen, his worries came back to him with a rush, while Crescenz wrung her hands in impotent fury, or tried to work off her rage by a vengeful scouring of pots and pans and a polishing of silver.

At length the sultry atmosphere of the baroness’s return broke in a terrible storm. During one of the scenes, the baron lost patience, and, abandoning his customary attitude of courteous indifference (that of a schoolboy who is being scolded), he flung out of the room, and, before banging the door so that every window in the flat rattled, he yelled:

“I’m absolutely fed up.”

His face blue with wrath, he burst into the kitchen and shouted to the trembling Crescenz:

“Pack my portmanteau at once and take down my gun-case. I shall go for a week’s shooting. The devil himself could not stick it in such a hell as this.”

Crescenz looked up at him, her eyes shining with enthusiasm. He was master once more, had asserted himself! With a hoarse laugh she said:

“Quite right, Sir. Time and more to put a stop to this!”

Quivering with zeal, she hastened from room to room and got together all he could possibly want for the expedition. She carried portmanteau and gun-case to the cab. But when he was about to say a word of thanks, he was startled by her aspect. Her pinched lips were parted in the malicious smile which always alarmed him, reminding him as it did of what a beast of prey looks like when about to spring. But she curtsied becomingly, and, as he drove off, whispered with an air that was only impertinent because of the intimacy it implied:

“Have a good time, Sir, while you’re away. I’ll tend to everything.”

Three days later the baron was recalled by a laconic wire:

“Essential return home instantly.”

The cousin who had sent it met him at the station, and Ernst’s face was enough to show Rudolf that something terrible had happened. After a futile attempt to “Break the news,” he told the baron that Baroness von Ledersheim had been found dead in bed that morning, with the room full of gas from the unlighted gas-heater. Accident was out of the question. The death must have been intentional, for the gas-heater had not been used throughout the summer, and the weather was still warm. Besides, overnight the dead woman had taken a dozen or more tablets of veronal. Furthermore, Crescenz, the cook, who had been alone in the house with her mistress, testified to having heard the latter go into the dressing-room presumably in order to turn on the master-tap of the gas-stove which for safety was placed there instead of in the bedroom. In view of these facts, the police surgeon had certified the death to be suicidal.

The baron’s hands trembled. When his cousin mentioned Crescenz’s report, his flesh crept, for a distressing thought flashed into his mind. But he repressed the tormenting idea and silently accompanied Ernst to the flat. The corpse had already been removed. His relatives hostile of mien, were awaiting him in the drawing-room, and their condolences were icy. As if accusingly, they “Felt it their duty” to inform him that there would be no possibility of hushing up the scandal, for in the morning the servantmaid had rushed out on to the public staircase screaming, “The missus has killed herself!” They had arranged for a quiet funeral, but already “Society folk” were saying illnatured things. Rudolf listened confusedly, raised his eyes involuntarily towards the door leading from sitting-room into bedroom, and then quickly looked back at the floor. There was that haunting thought he wanted to think out to its logical conclusion-but this idle and hostile chatter made connected thinking impossible. For half an hour his relatives stayed, black-a-vised and reproachful; then, one after another, they bade farewell, leaving Rudolf alone in the darkening chamber stricken by the unexpected blow; with aching head and weary limbs. He still stood, too listless even to sit down.

Someone knocked at the door.

“Come in!” he cried.

The door behind him opened, and there was a sound of hesitating, shuffling footsteps-footsteps he recognized. He was horrified, had a feeling of strangulation in his throat and of goose-flesh all over his body and limbs. He tried to turn round, but his muscles would not obey his will. Thus he remained standing in the middle of th room, tremulous, silent, hands clenched, while fully aware how contemptible must be the aspect of this guilty silence. Then, still from behind, came in a dry, indifferent, matter-of-fact tone, the words:

“I only come to ask whether the master will dine at home or out.”

The baron trembled even more violently, and the icy chill gripped him at the heart. He made three attempts before he could answer:

“Thanks, I want nothing to eat.”

The shuffling footsteps receded before he found courage to look round. Then his immobility was broken. He shook like an aspen leaf, but had strength to leap towards the door and turn the key in the lock, resolved to hinder the re-entry of those detestable and ghostly footsteps. Then he flung himself on the sofa, and vainly tried to strangle the loathsome thought which obtruded itself into his reluctant mind. It was an obsession which kept him awake the livelong night, and would not leave him even when day returned, nor when, clad in the customary suit of solemn black, he stood as chief mourner at the head of his deceased wife’s coffin.

Directly the funeral was over the baron fled from the capital. He could not bear the way in which his friends and relatives looked at him. Their sympathy was tinged with an inquisitorial demeanour—or did he only fancy this to be so? Fancied or real, it was insupportable. Even inanimate objects looked at him accusingly. Every piece of furniture in the flat, and especially those in the bedroom (where the sickly-sweet odour of gas lingered), repelled him whenever he entered the place. But the insufferable hag-riding, whether by night or by day, was the imperturbability of his sometime confidante, who went about her business in the empty dwelling as if nothing untoward had happened. Since that moment at the station when his cousin had mentioned her name, he dreaded contact with her. Whenever he heard her step, it was difficult for him to control the impulse to run away. He was nauseated by the though of her: her harsh voice; her greasy hair; her dull, bestial pitilessness. Rage over-mastered him because he lacked strength to rid himself of the incubus, to tear the stranglehold of her fingers from his throat. His only resource was flight. He packed his trunk secretly, without saying a word to her; and stole away, having scribbled a note to the effect that he was going to stay with friends in Carinthia.

He did not return till the summer was over, except for one brief visit necessitated by matters connected with his late wife’s property. Then he stayed at a hotel, to avoid, having to set eyes upon the bird of evil omen at the flat. Crescenz, who kept herself to herself, never knew that he had been in Vienna. Unoccupied, gloomy as an owl, she spent her days in the kitchen, but went twice to Mass (instead of once only, as previously). The baron’s solicitor provided her with funds and checked her accounts. Of her master she heard not a word, for he neither wrote to her nor sent a message. During this time of silent waiting, her face grew harsher and leaner, her movements became wooden as of old. Thus the months passed for her in a strange condition of rigid apathy.

In the autumn, however, the baron was recalled to the flat by urgent business. He stood hesitant on the threshold. Many weeks spent with intimate friends had enabled him to forget a good deal; but now that he was about to see again in the flesh the woman who had perhaps been his accomplice, he was agitated and near to vomiting, as he had been the day after his wife’s death. Step by step, as he mounted the stairs, it seemed to him that an invisible hand was gripping his throat. He moved slower and slower and had to summon all his forces before he could bring himself to turn his latch-key in the lock.

At the sound, Crescenz rushed out of the kitchen in astonishment. When she saw her master, she urned pale and then, as if making an obeisance, stooped to pick up the hand-valise he had put down in the entry. She forgot to say a word of welcome, and the baron was equally remiss. No “Good day” passed his lips. Silently she carried the valise into his bedroom, and silently he followed. In silence he waited, looking out of the window, till she had left the room. Then he hurriedly locked the door.

That was their only greeting after his long absence.

Crescenz waited. The baron waited too, in the hope that these paroxysms of horror at sight of her would cease to trouble him. But there was no improvement. Even before he saw her, when he merely heard her shuffling footsteps in the passage, he became giddy and had a sensation of nausea. He could not eat a morsel of the breakfast she prepared for him. Morning after morning, he slipped from the house as soon as he was dressed, and did not return till late at night, his object being to avoid a glimpse of her, and to be out of hearing of her movements. The few orders he was obliged to give were given without looking at her. He was choked by the air she breathed.

Crescenz, for her part, spent her days sitting mumchance upon her stool in the kitchen. She did not trouble to prepare food for herself, having no appetite; and she would not say a word to anyone. She sat, timidly awaiting the master’s whistle, like a whipped cur that recognizes it has done wrong. How, precisely, she could have been at fault, she was too stupid to guess. All she knew was that her master, her god, had turned his face away from her, and that his displeasure was agony.

Th days after the baron’s return, the door-bell rang. A grey-haired man, with a quiet demeanour, clean-shaven, carrying a hand-bag, stood on the landing. Crescenz waved him away, but the newcomer explained that he was the valet, that the Herr Baron had ordered him to come at ten, and that Crescenz must announce him. She turned as white as chalk, and stood stock-still for a moment, hand raised and fingers outspread. Then this hand dropped like a winged bird.

“Go and announce yourself,” she said snappishly to the astonished valet, turned on her heel, and retreated into the kitchen, slamming the door behind her.

The manservant stayed on. Thenceforward Rudolf had no need to say a word to Crescenz, giving his orders through the instrumentality of this quiet fellow, who was elderly, and accustomed to service in the best families. Crescenz no longer knew what went on in the flat outside the kitchen, the life of the place flowing over her head like deep water over a stone.

This distressing state of affairs lasted a fortnight, and had upon Crescenz the effect of a wasting disease. Her face fell away, and the hair on her temples turned grey. If her movements had before been wooden, now she seemed turned into stone. She sat motionless as an idol, staring vacantly out of the window; but when she had work to do, she did it in furious, quasi-maniacal out-bursts.

When the fortnight was up, the manservant came one morning unsummoned into the master’s study, and waited discreetly to indicate that he had a communication to make. Once before he had ventured to complain about the offensive manners of the “Tyrolese baggage”, as he disdainfully called her, and had advised her being given notice. On that occasion, however, the baron, feeling sorry for Crescenz, had refused to act on the suggestion. The valet did not dare to press the point. This time, however, the man was more urgent in his representations. When Rudolf said that Crescenz had been a long time in his service, and he saw no adequate ground for dismissing her, the valet, instead of taking no for an answer, looked perplexedly at the baron, reiterated his request, and then, with considerable embarrassment, said:

“Sir, I’m afraid you’ll think me a fool, but the fact is...I’m afraid of the woman....She’s furtive, malicious....The Herr Baron really does not realize how dangerous a person he has as member of his household.”

Ledersheim was alarmed in spite of himself. But the information was too vague.

“Anton,” he said, you must speak more plainly, if I’m to do what you want.”

“Well, Herr Baron, I really can’t say anything definite. What I feel is that Crescenz is like a wild beast, or a beast only half-tamed; and that at any moment she might do me, or you, Sir, a mischief. Yesterday, when I was giving her your orders, she looked at me...it was something more than a look...she glared at me as if about to spring upon me and fix her teeth in my throat. I’m really afraid, Sir, to eat the food she cooks. She might poison me, or you, Sir, any day. The Herr Baron really doesn’t know how dangerous she is. It’s not what she says. She says nothing. But I’m positive she’s ripe for committing a murder.”

Rudolf looked at the accuser in alarm. Had the man heard some gossip? Had he conceived any definite suspicion? Rudolf became aware that his fingers were trembling, and he laid his cigar on the ash-tray, lest this tremor should betray him. But Anton’s face was impassive, and conveyed no sign of unuttered knowledge. The baron hesitated. The valet’s advice marched with his own wishes. He would like to get rid of Crescenz.

“I don’t want to be precipitate,” he said. “Perhaps you are right, but wait a little longer. If she is rude to you again, you can give her notice without consulting me, saying, of course, that you do so on my orders.”

“Very good, Sir,” answered Anton, and the baron went out with a sense of relief—though anything that reminded him of this enigmatical creature poisoned the day for him. The best thing would be, he thought, if Crescenz could be cleared out of the house while he was away—at Christmas, perhaps. The thought of being freed from the incubus did him a lot of good. Christmas would be most suitable. He was going to spend Christmas with friends.

The very next morning, however, immediately after breakfast, when he had seated himself in his study, there came a knock at the door. Unthinkingly he looked up from his newspaper, and called:

“Come in!”

Thereupon, with the hard yet shuffling step he had come to loathe, she entered, the figure that haunted his dreams. He was startled at the change in her. Always ill-favoured, her bony, wasted visage now looked like a death’s-head above her black garments. His detestation was tinged with compassion when he noticed how the down-trodden woman stopped short at the edge of the carpet, too humble to advance nearer. To hide his own emotion, he spoke as unconcernedly as possible:

“What is it, Crescenz?”

Yet, for all he could do, his tone, instead of being cordial, was repellent and angry.

Crescenz did not move, but stared gloomily at the carpet. After a long pause, she managed (like one kicking, something out of the way) to eject the words:

“Anton...Anton says that the Herr Baron gives me notice.”

Genuinely distressed, Rudolf von Ledersheim rose to his feet. He had never intended matters to take so swift a course. Stammeringly he explained that Anton ha been too precipitate. Everything could be smooth over if she could manage to be a little less cross-grained towards the valet. Servants must behave decently to one another; and so on.

Crescenz stood unheeding, her eyes boring into th carpet, her shoulders stubbornly raised, her head hanging disconsolately. She was awaiting a word that did not come. When at last, out of humour at having to assume an apologetic role towards a domestic, he stayed the flow of his eloquence, she still had no answer but mutinous silence.

After this awkward pause had lasted two or three minutes, she said:

“What I want to know is, whether the master himself told Anton to give me notice.”

She flung the words at him, fiercely, morosely. Was there an implied threat? A challenge? Both his cowardice and his sympathy took wings and vanished. Hatred for this woman, which had been accumulating for weeks and months, burst the dams and overflowed. His one desire was to see the last of her. With an abrupt change of tone, he assumed the cutting and circumstantial manner he had learned to use on occasions when he had been an under-secretary of State, and replied:

“Yes, Crescenz, such is the fact. To save trouble, I have put Anton in charge of household affairs. If he has given you notice, you must go. Unless, indeed, you can bring yourself to behave decently to him. Then I might say a word for you, and ask him to overlook your past boorishness. Otherwise, you’ll have to leave; and the sooner the better.”

If she meant to threaten him, she should get as good as she gave! He would stand no nonsense!

But the look which Crescenz now raised from the carpet had no menace in it. Merely that of a hunted beast, which sees the pack break from the coppice where it is about to take refuge.

“Thank you, Sir,” she said in a broken voice. “I’ll leave at once. I don’t want to be a trouble to you.”

Slowly turning, she shuffled out of the room.

That evening when, having returned from the opera, the baron went into his study to look at the letters delivered during the afternoon, he saw on the table an unfamiliar object-an oblong box of peasant workmanship. It was not locked. The contents, carefully arranged, were the trifles Crescenz had received from him: a few postcards sent when he had been away shooting, two theatre tickets, a silver ring. Besides these there was a pile of banknotes (the savings of a lifetime), and a snapshot taken in Tyrol twenty years before. In it her eyes, dazzled by the flashlight, had the distressful and whippedcur expression with which she had received his confirmation of her dismissal.

Much perplexed, the baron rang for Anton to ask why on earth Crescenz had placed her belongings on his study-table. The valet went to call his enemy to account. But Crescenz was not to be found in the kitchen, in her attic bedroom, or anywhere else in the building. Not until next day, when they read a news-item in the paper to the effect that a woman about forty years of age had drowned herself in the Danube, did master and man know what had become of Leporella.

THE RUNAWAY

ONE night during the summer of 1918, a fisherman, in his boat on Lake Geneva, not far from the little Swiss town of Villeneuve, caught sight of something unusual on the surface of the water. Drawing nearer to this object he perceived it to be a raft made of beams roughly tied together, which a naked man was awkwardly trying to paddle forward by means of a plank. The paddler was cold and exhausted, and the amazed fisherman was touched to pity. He helped the shivering voyager on board his own boat, wrapped him in some nets which were the only available covering, and tried to open up a conversation. But the rescued stranger, cowering in the bottom of the boat, answered in a tongue of which the fisherman could not recognize a syllable. Giving up the attempt as a bad job, the latter hauled in the net he had come to examine, and rowed with steady strokes towards the land.

When the outline of the shore grew plain in the gathering light of dawn, the naked man began to look more cheerful. A smile played about the large mouth half hidden in an exuberant and disorderly growth of moustache and beard. Pointing shoreward, he repeatedly exclaimed-half questioningly and half exultantly—a word which sounded like“Rossiya.” His tone grew ever more confident and more joyful as the boat came nearer to the land. At length the keel grated on the beach. The fisherman’s womenfolk, who ran down to help in the landing of the night’s catch, dispersed with cries of alarm, like Nausicaa’s maidens of old when they caught sight of the naked Ulysses. At the strange tidings of what the fisherman had found in the lake, the other men of the village flocked to the strand, among them the mayor of the little place. This worthy fellow, self-important and full of the dignity of office, called to mind all the instructions that had come from headquarters during the four years of the war. Convinced that the newcomer must be a deserter from the French shore of the lake, he promptly endeavoured to make a formal inquiry, but was soon baffled by an impenetrable obstacle—they could not understand one another. To all questions the stranger (rigged out by now in an old pair of trousers and a coat found for him by one of the villagers) made no other answer than his own query, “Rossiya? Rossiya?” uttered in imploring but ever more faltering tones. A trifle annoyed at his failure, the mayor strode off towards the court-house, signing imperatively to the refugee to follow. Amid the babble of the youngsters; who had by now assembled, the bare-footed man, his borrowed habiliments flapping loose about him, did as he was bid, and thus came to the court-house, where he was placed in safe custody. He made no protest; uttered no word; but his face was once more overcast with gloom, and he stooped timidly as if in expectation of a blow.

The news of the fisherman’s remarkable haul soon spread to the neighbouring hotels. Well-to-do visitors, delighted to hear of something which would help them to while away an hour, came in great numbers to inspect the wild man. A lady offered him some sweets, but with monkey-like suspicion he refused to touch them. A visitor with a camera took a snapshot. Crowding round the raree-show they all chattered merrily. At length there arrived upon the scene the manager of one of the largest hotels in the vicinity, a man who had lived in many lands and was a good linguist. He tried the stranger, who was by now bewildered and even frightened, in one tongue after another-German, Italian, English, and finally Russian. At the first word of Russian, the poor fellow started, and instantly plucked up heart. His homely but good-natured countenance was split by a smile reaching from ear to ear. Instantly, and with confident mien he began to pour out his history. It was long and confused and was not in all points intelligible to the chance interpreter. But substantially the story ran as follows.

He had fought in Russia. One day he and a thousand others had been packed into railway carriages, and had travelled a vast distance by train. Then they had all embarked on a ship, and had made a yet longer journey, a voyage across seas on which it was so hot that—as he phrased it—his very bones had been grilled. At length they had landed. Another railway journey, and immediately after leaving the train they had been sent to storm a hill. Of this fight he could say little, for at the very outset he had gone down with a bullet in the leg.

To the auditors, taking up the story as interpreted sentence after sentence by the hotel manager, it was at once obvious that this refugee had belonged to one of the Russian divisions sent across Siberia and shipped to France from Vladivostock. Curiosity mingled with compassion, and everyone wanted to know what had induced the man to start on the remarkable journey that had led him to the lake.

With a smile that was frank, and yet not free from cunning, the Russian explained that while in hospital with his wound he had asked where Russia was, and the general direction of his home had been pointed out to him. As soon as he was able to walk, he had deserted, and had guided his homeward course by sun and stars. He had walked by night; and by day, to elude the patrols, he had hidden in haystacks. For food, he had gathered fruit, and had begged a loaf of bread here a there. At length, after ten nights march, he had reached this lake. Now his tale grew confused. He was a Siberian peasant; his home was close to Lake Baikal; he could make out the other shore of Lake Geneva, and fancied that it must be Russia. He had stolen two beams from hut, and, lying face downwards on these and using board as a paddle, he had made his way far across the lake when the fisherman had found him. He finished his story with the eager question:

“Shall I be able to reach home to-morrow?”

The translation of this inquiry provoked an outburst of laughter from those whose first thought was “Poor simpleton!” But their second thought was tinged with sympathy, and everyone contributed a trifle when a collection was made for the timid and almost tearful deserter.

But now a police official of high rank, summoned by telephone from Montreux, put in an appearance, and with no small difficulty drew up a formal report. Not only was the chance-found interpreter often out of his depth, but the Siberian’s complete lack of culture imposed a barrier between his mind and that of these westerners. He knew little more of himself than that his name was Boris; he could give no surname. He had lived with his wife and three children fifty versts from the great lake. They were the serfs of Prince Metchersky (he used the word “Serfs”, although it is more than half a century since serfdom was abolished in Russia).

A discussion concerning his fate now ensued, while, with bowed shoulders and depressed visage, he stood among the disputants. Some considered that he ought to be sent to the Russian embassy in Berne, but others objected that this could only lead to his being shepherded back to France. The police official explained how difficult it was to decide whether he was to be treated as a deserter, or simply as a foreigner without identification papers. The relieving officer of the district was prompt to explain that this wanderer had certainly no claim to food and lodging at the cost of the local community. A Frenchman excitedly intervened, saying that the case of this wretched absconder was plain that enough: let him be put to work, or sent back across the frontier. Two women protested that the poor man was not to blame for his misfortunes; it was a crime to tear people away from their homes, and to convey them into foreign land. Political quarrels were imminent when an old gentleman, a Dane, suddenly declared his willingness to pay for the stranger’s keep throughout the ensuing week; meanwhile the local authorities could discuss matters with the Russian embassy. This unexpected solution put an end to the official perplexities, and made the lay controversialists forget their differences.

While the argument had been waxing hot, the timid eyes of the runaway had been riveted on the lips of the hotel manager, as the only person in the medley who could make his fate known to him. In a dull fashion, he seemed to understand the complications his coming had aroused. Now, when the tumult of voices ceased, he raised his clasped hands beseechingly towards the manager’s face, like a woman praying before a holy image. All were touched by the gesture. The manager cordially assured him that he could be quite easy in his mind. He would be allowed to stay here for a time. No one would harm him, and his wants would be supplied in the village hostelry. The Russian wanted to kiss the manager’s hand, but the latter would not permit the unfamiliar form of thanksgiving. He took the refugee to the inn were bed and board were to be provided, gave the man reiterated assurances that all was well, and, with a final nod of friendly leave-taking, made his way back to the hotel.

The runaway stared after the manager’s retreating form, and his face clouded over once more at the loss or the only person who could understand him. Regardless of those who were watching his strange demeanour with amusement, he followed the manager with his eyes until his friend vanished into the hotel some way up the hill. Now one of the onlookers touched the Russian compassionately on the shoulder, and pointed to the door of the inn. With hanging head the runaway entered his temporary abode. He was shown into the tap-room, and seated himself at the table, where the maid in welcome, served him with a glass of brandy. Here, overcast with gloom, he spent the rest of the morning. The village children were continually peeping at him through the window; they laughed, and they shouted to him from time to time, but he paid no heed. Customers looked at him inquisitively; but all the time he sat with his eyes fixed on the table, shame-faced and shy. When dinner was served, the room was filled with merry talkative people; but the Russian could not understand a word of their conversation. Painfully aware that he was a stranger among strangers, he was practically deaf and dumb amid folk who could all exchange ideas in lively fashion. His hands were so tremulous that he could hardly eat his soup. A tear coursed down over his cheek, and dropped heavily on to the table. He glanced timidly round. The other guests noticed his distress, and a silence fell upon the company. He was overwhelmed with shame; his unkempt head drooped nearer and nearer to the black wooden table.

He stayed in the tap-room till evening. People came and went, but he was no longer aware of them nor they of him. He continued to sit in the shadow of the stove, resting his hands on the table. Everyone had forgotten his presence. When, in the gloaming, he suddenly rose and went out, nobody marked his going. Like a dumb beast, he walked heavily up the hill to the hotel, and stationed himself humbly, cap in hand just outside the main door. For a whole hour he stood there without claiming notice from anyone. But at length this strange figure, stiff and black like a tree-trunk rooted in front of the brightly lit entrance to the hotel, attracted the attention of one of the porters, who went to fetch the manager. A flicker of cheerfulness came once more into the Siberian’s face at the latter’s first words.

“What do you want, Boris?” asked the manager kindly.

“Beg pardon, Sir,” said the runaway haltingly. “All I want to know is...whether I may go home.”

“Yes, Boris, of course you may go home,” said the manager with a smile.

“To-morrow?”

The other grew serious. The word was said so imploringly that the smile vanished.

“No, Boris, not yet....Not till the war is over.”

“How soon? When will the war be over?”

“God knows! No man can say.”

“Must I wait all that time? Can’t I go sooner?”

“No, Boris.”

“Is my home so far away?”

“Yes.”

“Many days’ journey?”

“Many, many days.”

“But I can walk there. I’m a strong man. I shan’t get tired.”

“You can’t do that, Boris. There’s another frontier to cross before you can get home.”

“A frontier?” He looked perplexed. The word had no meaning for him.

Then, with his marvellous persistency he went on:

“I can swim across.”

The manager could hardly restrain a smile. But he was grieved at the other’s plight, and he said gently:

“No, Boris, you won’t be able to do that. A frontier means a foreign country. The people who live there won’t let you through.”

“But I shan’t do them any harm. I’ve thrown away my rifle. Why should they refuse to allow me to go back to my wife, when I beg them to let me pass for Christ’ sake?”

The manager’s face became still graver. Bitterness filled his soul.

“No,” he said, “They will not let you pass, Boris, not even for Christ’s sake. Men no longer hearken to Christ’ words.”

“But what am I to do, Sir? I cannot stay here. No one understands what I say, and I do not understand anyone.”

“You’ll learn to understand them in time.”

“No, Sir.” He shook his head. “I shall never be able to learn. I can only till the ground, nothing more. What can I do here? I want to go home! Show me the way!”

“There isn’t any way, Boris.”

“But, Sir, they can’t forbid my going back to my wife and children! I’m not a soldier any more!”

“Yes, Boris, they can forbid you.”

“But the Tsar? Surely he will help me?” This was a sudden thought. The runaway trembled with hope, and mentioned the Tsar with intense veneration.

“There is no Tsar now, Boris. He has been deposed.”

“No Tsar now?” He stared vacantly at the manager. The last gleam of hope was extinguished, and the spark faded from his eyes. He said wearily: “So I can’t go home?”

“Not yet. You must wait, Boris.”

“Will it be long?”

“I don’t know.”

The face in the darkness grew ever more despondent.

“I have waited so long! How can I wait any longer? Show me the way. I will try.”

“There is no way, Boris. They will arrest you at the frontier. Stay here, and we will find you something to do.” “They don’t understand me here, and I can’t understand them,” he faltered. “I can’t live here! Help me, Sir!”

“I cannot, Boris.”

“Help me, Sir, for Christ’s sake! Help me, for otherwise I have no hope.”

“I cannot help you, Boris. Men can no longer help one another.”

The two stood gazing into each other’s eyes. Boris twisted his cap between his fingers.

“Why did they take me away from home? They said I had to fight for Russia and the Tsar. But Russia is a long way off, and the Tsar...what did you say they had done to the Tsar?”

“They have deposed him.”

“Deposed?” He repeated the word vaguely. “What am I to do, Sir? I must get home. My children are crying for me. I cannot live here. Help me, Sir, please help me!”

“I cannot, Boris.”

“Can no one help me?”

“No one, now.”

The Russian hung his head still more sadly. Suddenly he spoke in a dull tone:

“Thank you, Sir,” and therewith turned on his heel and departed.

Slowly he walked away down the hill. The manager watched him as he went, and wondered why he did not enter the inn, but passed onwards down the steps leading to the lake. With a sigh, the kindhearted interpreter went back to his work in the hotel.

As chance would have it, the very same fisherman who had rescued the living Siberian from the lake found the drowned man’s naked body in the morning. The runaway had carefully folded the borrowed coat and trousers, had laid them on the shore with the borrowed cap, and had marched down into the water, nude as he had come forth from it. Since the foreigner’s name was unknown, no memorial but a nameless wooden cross could be erected over his grave.





THE ROYAL GAME


THE big liner, due to sail from New York to Buenos Aires at midnight, was filled with the activity and bustle incident to the last hour. Visitors who had come to see their friends off pressed hither and thither, page-boys with caps smartly cocked slithered through the public rooms shouting names snappily, baggage, parcels and flowers were being hauled about, inquisitive children ran up and down companion-ways, while the deck orchestra provided persistent accompaniment. I stood talking to an acquaintance on the promenade deck, somewhat apart from the hubbub, when two or three flash-lights sprayed sharply near us, evidently for press photos of some prominent passenger at a lastminute interview. My friend looked in that direction and smiled.

“You have a queer bird on board, that Czentovic.”

And as my face must have revealed that the statement meant nothing to me he added, by way of explanation, “Mirko Czentovic, the world chess champion. He has just finished off the U.S.A. in a coast-tocoast exhibition tour and is on his way to capture Argentina.”

This served to recall not only the name of the young world champion but also a few details relating to his rocket-like career; my friend a more observant newspaper reader than I, was able to eke them out with a string of anecdotes. At a single stroke, about a year ago, Czentovic had aligned himself with the solidest Elder Statesmen of the art of chess, such as Alekhin, Capa-blanca, Tartakover, Lasker, Boguljobov; not since the appearance of the nine-year-old prodigy, Reshevsky, in New York in 1922, had a newcomer crashed int the famed guild to the accompaniment of such widespread interest. It seems that Czentovic’s intellectual equipment, at the beginning, gave small promise of so brilliant a career. The secret soon seeped through that in his private capacity this champion wasn’t able to write a single sentence in any language without misspelling a word, and that, as one of his vexed colleagues, wrathfully sarcastic, put it, “He enjoys equal ignorance in every field of culture.” His father, a poverty-stricken Yugoslavian boatman on the Danube, had been run down in his tiny vessel one night by a grain steamer, and the orphaned boy, then twelve, was taken in charge by the pastor of their obscure village out of pity. The good man did his level best to instill into the indolent, slowspeaking, low-browed child at home what he seemed unable to grasp in the village school.

But all efforts proved vain. Mirko stared blankly at the writing exercise just as if the strokes had not already been explained a hundred times; his lumbering brain lacked every power to grasp even the simplest subjects. At fourteen he still counted with his fingers, and it was only by dint of great strain that he could read in a book or newspaper. Yet none could say that Mirko was unwilling or disobedient. Whatever he was told to do he did: fetched water, split wood, worked in the field, washed up the kitchen, and he could be relied upon to execute—even if with exasperating slowness—every service that was demanded. But what grieved the kindly pastor most about the blockhead was his total lack of co-operation. He performed no deed unless specially directed, asked no questions, never played with other lads, and sought no occupation of his own accord; after Mirko had concluded his work about the house, he would sit idly with that empty stare one sees with grazing sheep, without participating in the slightest in what might be going on. Of an evening, while the pastor sucked at his long peasant pipe and played his customary three games of chess with the policesergeant, the fair-haired dull-wit squatted silent alongside them, staring from under his heavy lids, seemingly sleepy and indifferent, at the checkered board.

One winter evening, while the two men were absorbed in their daily game, a rapid crescendo of bells gave notice of a quickly approaching sleigh. A peasant, his cap covered with snow, stamped in hastily to tell the pastor that his mother lay dying and to ask his immediate attendance in the hope that there was still time to administer extreme unction. The priest accompanied him at once. The police-sergeant, who had not yet finished his beer, lighted a fresh pipe preparatory to leaving, and was about to draw on his heavy sheepskin boots when he noticed how immovably Mirko’s gaze was fastened on the board with its interrupted game.

“Well, do you want to finish it?” he said jocularly, fully convinced that the sleepyhead had no notion of how to move a single piece. The boy looked up shyly, nodded assent, and took the pastor’s place. After fourteen moves the sergeant was beaten and he had to concede that his defeat was in no wise attributable to avoidable carelessness. The second game resulted similarly.

“Balaam’s ass!” cried the astounded pastor upon his return, explaining to the policeman, a lesser expert in the Bible, that two thousand years ago there had been a like miracle of a dumb being suddenly endowed with the speech of wisdom. The late hour notwithstanding, the good man could not forgo challenging his half-illiterate helper to a contest. Mirko beat him too, with ease. He played toughly, slowly, deliberately, never once raising bowed broad brow from the board. But he played with irrefutable certainty, and in the days that followed neither the priest nor the policeman was able to win a single game.

The priest, best able to assess his ward’s various short comings, now became curious as to the manner in which this one-sided singular gift would resist a severer test. After Mirko had been made somewhat presentable by the efforts of the village barber, he drove him in his sleigh to the near-by town where he knew that many chess-players—a cut above him in ability, he was aware from experience—were always to be found in the cafe on the main square. The pastor’s entrance, as he steered the straw-haired, red-cheeked fifteen-year-old before him, created no small stir in the circle; the boy, in his sheepskin jacket (woollen side in) and high boots, eyes shyly downcast, stood aside until summoned to a chess-table.

Mirko lost the first encounter because his master had never employed the Sicilian defence. The next game, with the best player of the lot, resulted in a draw. But in the third game and the fourth and all that came after he slew them, one after the other.

It so happens that little provincial towns of Yugoslavia are seldom the theatre of exciting events; consequently, this first appearance of the peasant champion before the assembled worthies became no less than a sensation. It was unanimously decided to keep the boy in town until the next day for a special gathering of the chess club and, in particular, for the benefit of Count Simczic of the castle, a chess fanatic. The priest, who now regarded his ward with quite a new pride, but whose joy of discovery was subordinate to the sense of duty which called him home to his Sunday service, consented to leave him for further tests. The chess group put young Czentovic up at the local hotel, where he saw a water-closet for the first time in his life. The chess-room was crowded to capacity on Sunday afternoon. Mirko faced the board immobile for fours, spoke no word, and never looked up; one player after another fell before him. Finally a multiple game after was proposed; it took a while before they could make clear to the novice that he had to play against several contestants at one and the same time. No sooner had Mirko grasped the procedure than he adapted himself to it, and trod slowly with heavy, creaking shoes from table to table, eventually winning seven of the eight games.

Grave consultations now took place. True, strictly speaking, the new champion was not of the town, yet the innate national pride had received a fillip. Here was a chance, at last, for this town, so small that its existence was hardly suspected, to put itself on the map by sending a great man into the world. A vaudeville agent named Koller who supplied the local garrison cabaret with talent, offered to obtain professional training for the youth from a Viennese expert whom he knew, and to see him through for a year if the deficit were, made good. Count Simczic who in his sixty years of daily chess had never encountered so remarkable an antagonist, signed the guarantee promptly. That day marked the opening of the astonishing career of the Danube boatman’s son.

It took only six months for Mirko to master every secret of chess technique, though with one odd limitation which later became apparent to the votaries of the game and caused many a sneer. He never was able to memorize a single game, or, to use the professional term, to play blind. He lacked completely the ability to conceive the board in the limitless space of the imagination. He had to have the field of sixtyfour black and white squares and the thirty-two pieces tangibly before him; even when he had attained international fame he carried a folding pocket board with him in order to be able to reconstruct a game or work on a problem by visual means. This deficit, in itself not important, betrayed a want of imaginative power and provoked animated discussions among chess enthusiasts similar to those in musical circles when it discovers that an outstanding virtuoso or conductor is unable to play or direct without a score. This singularity, however, was no obstacle to Mirko’s stupendous rise, At seventeen he already possessed a dozen prizes, at eighteen he won the Hungarian mastery, and finally, at twenty, the championship of the world. The boldest experts, everyone of them immeasurably his superior in brains, imagination, and audacity, fell before his tough, cold logic as did Napoleon before the clumsy Kutusov and Hannibal before Fabius Cunctator, of whom Livy records that his traits of phlegm and imbecility were already conspicuous in his childhood. Thus it occurred that the illustrious gallery of chess masters, which included eminent representatives of widely varied intellectual fields—philosophers, mathematicians, constructive, imaginative, and often creative talents—was invaded by a complete outsider, a heavy, taciturn peasant from whom not even the cunningest journalists were ever able to extract a word that would help to make a story. Yet, however he may have deprived the newspapers of polished phrases, substitutes in the way of anecdotes about his person were numerous, for, inescapably, the moment he arose from the board at which he was the incomparable master, Czentovic became a grotesque, an almost comic figure. In spite of his correct dress, his fashionable cravat with its too ostentatious pearl tie-pin, and his carefully manicured nails, he remained in manners and behaviour the narrow-minded lout who was accustomed to sweeping out the priest’s kitchen. He utilized his gift and his fame to squeeze out all the money they would yield, displaying petty and often vulgar greed, always with a shameless clumsiness that aroused his professional colleagues’ ridicule and anger. He travelled from town to town, stopped at the cheapest hotels, played for any club that would pay his fee, sold the advertising rights in his portrait to a soap manufacturer,and oblivious of his competitors’ scorn—they being aware that he hardly knew how to write-attached his name to a Philosophy of Chess that had been written by a hungry Galician student for a businessminded publisher. As with all leathery dispositions, he was wanting in any appreciation of the ludicrous; from the time he became champion he regarded himself as the most important man in the world, and the consciousness of having beaten all those clever, intellectual, brilliant speakers and writers in their own field and of earning more than they, transformed his early unsureness into a cold and awkwardly flaunted pride.

“And how can one expect that such rapid fame should fail to befuddle so empty a head?” concluded my friend who had just advanced those classic examples of Czentovic’s childish lust for rank.“Why shouldn’t a twenty-one-year-old lad from the Banat be afflicted with a frenzy of vanity if, suddenly, by merely shoving figures around on a wooden board, he can earn more in a week than his whole village does in a year by chopping down trees under the bitterest conditions? Besides, isn’t it damned easy to take yourself for a great man if you’re not burdened with the slightest suspicion that a Rembrandt, a Beethoven, a Dante, a Napoleon, ever even existed? There’s just one thing in that immured brain of his—the knowledge that he hasn’t lost a game of chess for months, and as he happens not to dream that the world holds other values than chess and money, he has every reason to be infatuated with himself.”

The information communicated by my friend could not fail to excite my special curiosity. I have always been fascinated by all types of monomania, by persons wrapped up in a single idea; for the stricter the limits a man sets for himself, the more clearly he approaches the eternal. Just such seemingly world-aloof persons create their own remarkable and quite unique world-in-little, and work, termite like, in their particular medium. Thus I made no bones about my intention to examine this specimen of one-track intellect under a magnifying glass during the twelve-day journey to Rio.

“You’ll be out of luck,” my friend warned me. “So far as I know, nobody has succeeded in extracting the least bit of psychological material from Czentovic. Underneath all his abyssmal limitations this sly farm-hand conceals the wisdom not to expose himself. The procedure is simple: except with such compatriots of his own sphere as he contrives to meet in ordinary taverns he avoids all conversation. When he senses a person of culture he retreats into his shell; that’s why nobody can plume himself on having heard him say something stupid or on having sounded the presumably bottomless depths of his ignorance.”

As a matter of fact, my friend was right. It proved utterly impossible to approach Czentovic during the first few days of the voyage, unless by intruding rudely, which, of course, isn’t my way. He did, sometimes, appear on the promenade deck, but then always with hands clasped behind his back in a posture of dignified self-absorption, like Napoleon in the familiar painting; and, at that, those peripatetic exhibitions were carried off in such haste and so jerkily that to gain one’s end one would have had to trot after him. The lounges, the bar, the smoking-room, saw nothing of him. A steward of whom I made confidential inquiries revealed that he spent the greater part of the day in his cabin with a large chess-board on which he recapitulated games or worked out new problems.

After three days it angered me to think that his defence tactics were more effective than my will to approach him. I had never before had a chance to know a great chess-player personally, and the more I now sought to familiarize myself with the type, the more incomprehensible seemed a lifelong brain activity that rotated exclusively about a space composed of sixty-four black and white squares. I was well aware from my own experience of the mysterious attraction of the royal game, which among all games contrived by man rises superior to the tyranny of chance and bestows its palm only on mental attainment, or rather on a definite form of mental endowment. But is it not an offensively narrow construction to call chess a game? Is it not a science, a technique, an art, that sways among these categories as Mahomet’s coffin does between heaven and earth, at once a union of all contradictory concepts: primeval yet ever new; mechanical in operation yet effective only through the imagination; bounded in geometric space though boundless in its combinations; ever-developing yet sterile; thought that leads to nothing;mathematics that produce no result; art without works; architecture without substance, and nevertheless, as proved by evidence, more lasting in its being and presence than all books and achievements; the only game that belongs to all peoples and all ages; of which none knows the divinity that bestowed it on the world, to slay boredom, to sharpen the senses, to exhilarate the spirit? One searches for its beginning and for its end. Children can learn its simple rules, duffers succumb to its temptation, yet within this immutable tight square it creates a particular species of master not to be compared with any other—persons destined for chess alone, specific geniuses in whom vision, patience, and technique are operative through a distribution no less precisely ordained than in mathematicians, poets, composers, but merely united on a different level. In the heyday of physiognomical research a Gall would perhaps have dissected the brains of such masters of chess to establish whether a particular coil in the grey matter of the brain, a sort of chess muscle or chess bump was more conspicuously developed than in other skulls. How a physiognomist would have been fascinated by the case of a Czentovic where that which is genius appears interstratified with an absolute inertia of the intellect like a single vein of gold in a ton of dead rock! It stands to reason that so unusual a game, one touched with genius, must create out of itself fitting matadors. This I always knew, but what was difficult and almost impossible to conceive of was the life of a mentally alert person whose world contracts to a narrow, black-andwhite one-way street; who seeks ultimate triumphs in the to-and-fro, forward-and-backward movement of thirty-two pieces; a being who, by a new opening in which the knight is preferred to the pawn, apprehends greatness and the immortality that goes with casual mention in a chess handbook-of a man of spirit who, escaping madness, can unremittingly devote all of his mental energy during ten, twenty, thirty, forty years to the ludicrous effort to corner a wooden king on a wooden board!

And here for the first time, one of these phenomena, one of these singular geniuses (or shall I say puzzling fools?) was close to me, six cabins distant, and I, unfortunate, for whom curiosity about mental problems manifested itself in a kind of passion, seemed unable to effect my purpose. I conjured up the absurdest ruses: should I tickle his vanity by the offer of an interview in an important paper, or engage his greed by proposing a lucrative exhibition tour of Scotland? Finally it occurred to me that the hunter’s never-failing practice is to lure the woodcock by imitating its mating cry, so what more; successful way was there of attracting a chess master’s attention to myself than by playing chess?

At no time had I ever permitted chess to absorb me seriously, for the simple reason that it meant nothing to me but a pastime; if I spend an hour at the board it is not because I want to subject myself to a strain but, on the contrary to relieve mental tension. I “Play” at chess in the literal sense of the word, whereas to real devotees it is serious business. Chess, like love, cannot be played alone, and up to that time I had no idea whether there were other chess lovers on board. In order to attract them from their lairs I set a primitive trap in the smoking-room in that my wife (whose game is even weaker than mine) and I sat at a chessboard as a decoy. Sure enough, we had made no more than six moves before one passer-by stopped, another asked permission to watch, and before long the desired partner materialized. MacIver was his name; a Scottish foundation-engineer who, I learned, had made a large fortune boring for oil in California. He was a robust specimen with an almost square jaw and strong teeth, and a rich complexion pronouncedly rubicund as a result, at least in part surely, of copious indulgence in whisky. His conspicuously broad, almost vehemently athletic shoulders made themselves unpleasantly noticeable in his game, for this MacIver typified those self-important worshippers of success who regard defeat in even a harmless contest as a blow to their self-esteem. Accustomed to achieving his ends ruthlessly, and spoiled by material success, this massive self-made man was so thoroughly saturated with his sense of superiority that opposition of any kind became undue resistance if not insult. After losing the first round he sulked and began to explain in detail, and dictatorially, that it would not have happened but for a momentary oversight; in the third he ascribed his failure to the noise in the adjoining room; never would he lose a game without at once demanding revenge. This ambitious crabbedness amused me at first, but as time went on I accepted it as the unavoidable accompaniment to my real purpose—tempt the master to our table.

By the third day it worked—but only half-way. It may be that Czentovic observed us at the chess-board through a window from the promenade deck or that he just happened to be honouring the smokingroom with his presence; anyway, as soon as he perceived us interlopers toying with the tools of his trade, he involuntarily stepped a little nearer and, keeping a deliberate distance, cast a searching glance at our board. It was MacIver’s move. This one move was sufficient to apprise Czentovic how little a further pursuit of our dilettantish striving was worthy of his expert interest. With the same matter-of-course gesture with which one of us disposes of a poor detective story that has been proffered in a library—without even thumbing its pages—he turned away from our table and left the room. “Weighed in the balance and found wanting,” I thought, slightly stung by the cool, contemptuous look, and to give vent to my ill-humour in some fashion, I said to MacIver, “Your move didn’t seem to impress the master.”

“Which master?”

I told him that the man who had just walked by after glancing disapprovingly at our game was Czentovic, international chess champion. I added that we would be able to survive it without taking his contempt too greatly to heart; the poor have to cook with water. But to my astonishment these idle words of mine produced quite an unexpected result. Immediately he became excited, forgot our game, and his ambition took to an almost audible throbbing. He had no notion that Czentovic was on board: Czentovic simply had to give him a game;the only time he had ever played with a champion was in a multiple game when he was one of forty, even that was fearfully exciting, and he had come quite near winning. Did I know the champion personally?—I didn’t.—Would I not invite him to join us? I declined on the ground that I was aware of Czentovic's reluctance to make new acquaintances. Besides, what charm would intercourse with third-rate players hold for a champion?

It would have been just as well not to say that about third-rate players to a man of MacIver’s brand of conceit. Annoyed, he leaned back and declared gruffly that, as for himself, he couldn’t believe that Czentovic would decline a gentleman’s courteous challenge; he’d see to that. Upon getting a brief description of the master’s person he stormed out, indifferent to our un-finished game, uncontrollably impatient to intercept Czentovic on the deck. Again I sensed that there was no holding the possessor of such broad shoulders once his will was involved in an undertaking.

I waited, somewhat tensed. Some ten minutes elapsed and MacIver returned, not in too good humour, it seemed to me.

“Well?” I asked.

“You were right,” he answered, a bit annoyed. “Not a very pleasant gentleman. I introduced myself and told him who I am. He didn’t even put out his hand. I tried to make him understand that all of us on board would be proud and honoured if he’d play the lot of us. But he was cursed stiff-necked about it; said he was sorry but his contract obligations to his agent definitely precluded any game during his entire tour except for a fee. And his minimum is $250 per game.”

I had to laugh. The thought would never have come to me that one could make so much money by pushing figures from black squares to white ones. “Well, I, hope you took leave of him with courtesy equal to his.”

MacIver, however, remained perfectly serious. “The match is to come off at three to-morrow afternoon. Here in the smoking room. I hope he won’t make mincemeat of us easily.”

“What! You promised him the $250?” I cried quite taken aback.

“Why not? It’s his business. If I had a toothache and there happened to be a dentist aboard, I wouldn’t, expect him to extract my tooth for nothing. The man’s right to ask a fat price; in every line the big shots are the best traders. So far as I’m concerned, the less complicated the business, the better. I’d rather pay in cash than have your Mr. Czentovic do me a favour and in the end have to say ‘Thank you.’ Anyway, many an evening at the club has cost me more than $250 without giving me a chance to play a world champion. It’s no disgrace for a third-rate player to be beaten by a Czentovic.”

It amused me to note how deeply I had injured MacIver’s self-love with that “Third-rate”. But as he was disposed to foot the bill it was not for me to remark on his wounded ambition which promised at last to afford me an acquaintance with my odd fish. Promptly we notified the four or five others who had revealed themselves as chess-players of the approaching event and reserved not only our own table but the adjacent ones so that we might suffer the least possible disturbance from passengers strolling by.

Next day all our group was assembled at the appointed hour. The centre seat opposite that of the master was allotted to MacIver as a matter of course; his nervousness found outlet in the smoking of strong cigars, one after another, and in restlessly glancing ever and again at the clock. The champion let us wait a good ten minutes—my friend’s tale prompted the surmise that something like this would happen—thus heightening the impressiveness of his entry. He approached the table calmly an imperturbably. He offered no greeting. “You know who I am and I’m not interested in who you are” was what his discourtesy seemed to imply, but he, began in a dry, businesslike way to lay down the conditions. Since there were not enough boards on the ship for separate games he proposed that we should play against him collectively. After each of his moves he would retire to the end of the room so that his presence might not affect our consultations. As soon as our countermove had been made we were to strike a glass with a spoon, no table-bell being available. He proposed, if it pleased us ten minutes as the maximum time for each move. Like timid pupils we accepted every suggestion: un-questioningly. Czentovic drew black at the choice of colours, while still standing he made the first counter-move, then turned at once to go to the designated waiting place where he reclined lazily while carelessly examining an illustrated magazine.

There is little point in reporting the game. It ended, as it could not but end, in our complete defeat, and by the twenty-fourth move at that. There was nothing particularly astonishing about an international champion wiping off half a dozen mediocre or sub-mediocre players with his left hand; what did disgust us, though, was the lordly manner with which Czentovic caused us to feel, all too plainly, that it was with his left hand that, we had been disposed of. Each time he would give a quick, seemingly careless look at the board, and would look indolently past us as if we ourselves were dead wooden figures; and this impertinent proceeding reminded one irresistibly of the way one throws a mangy dog a morsel without taking the trouble to look at him. According to my way of thinking, if he had any sensitivity he might have shown us our mistakes or cheered us up with a friendly word. Even at the conclusion this sub-human chess automaton uttered no syllable, but, after saying “Mate,” stood motionless at the table waiting to ascertain whether another game was desired. I had already risen with the thought of indicating by a gesture—helpless as one always remains in the face of thick-skinned rudeness—that as far as I was concerned the pleasure of our acquaintance was ended now that the dollars-and-cents part of it was over, when, to my anger, MacIver, next to me, spoke up hoarsely: “Revanche!”

The note of challenge startled me; MacIver at this moment seemed much more like a pugilist about to put up his fists than a polite gentleman. Whether it was Czentovic’s disagreeable treatment of us that affected him or merely MacIver’s own pathological irritable ambition, suffice it that the latter had undergone a complete change. Red in the face up to his hair, his nostrils taut from inner pressure, he breathed hard, and a sharp fold separated the bitten lips from his belligerently projected jaw. I recognized with disquiet that flicker of the eyes that connotes uncontrollable passion such as seizes players at roulette when the right colour fails to come after the sixth or seventh successively doubled stake. Instantly I knew that this fanatical climber would, even at the cost of his entire fortune, play against Czentovic and play and play and play, for simple or doubled stakes, until he won at least a single game. If Czentovic stuck to it, MacIver would prove a gold-mine that would yield him a nice few thousands by the time Buenos Aires came in sight.

Czentovic remained unmoved. “If you please,” he responded politely. “You gentlemen will take black this time.”

There was nothing different about the second game except that our group became larger because of a few added onlookers, and livelier, too. MacIver stared fixedly at the board as if he willed to magnetize the chess-men to victory; I sensed that he would have paid a thousand dollars with delight if he could but shout “Mate” at our cold-snouted adversary. Oddly enough, something of his sudden excitement entered unconsciously into all of us. Every single move was discussed with greater emotion than before; always we would wrangle up to the last moment before agreeing to signal Czentovic to return to the table. We had come to the seventeenth move and, to our own surprise, entered on a combination which seemed staggeringly advantageous because we had been enabled to advance a pawn to the last square but one; we needed but to move it forward to c1 to win a second queen. Not that we felt too comfortable about so obvious an opportunity; we were united in suspecting that the advantage which we seemed to have wrested could be no more than bait dangled by Czentovic whose vision enabled him to view the situation from a distance of several moves. Yet in spite of common examination and discussion, we were unable to explain it as a feint. At last, at the limit of our ten minutes, we decided to risk the move. MacIver’s fingers were on the pawn to move it to the last square when he felt his arm gripped and heard a voice, low and impetuous, whisper, “For God’s sake! Don’t!”

Involuntarily we all turned about. I recognized in the man of some forty-five years, who must have joined the group during the last few minutes in which we were absorbed in the problem before us, one whose narrow sharp face had already arrested my attention on deck strolls because of its extraordinary, almost chalky pallor. Conscious of our gaze, he continued rapidly:

“If you make a queen he will immediately attack with the bishop, then you’ll take it with your knight. Meantime, however, he moves his pawn to d7, threatens your rook, and even if you check with the knight you’re lost and will be wiped out in nine or ten moves. It’s practically the constellation that Alekhin introduced when he played Boguljobov in 1922 at the championship tournament at Pistany.”

Astonished, MacIver released the pawn and, like the rest of us, stared amazedly at the man who had descended in our midst like a rescuing angel. Anyone who can reckon a mate nine moves ahead must necessarily be a first-class expert, perhaps even a contestant now on his way to the tournament to seize the championship, so that his sudden presence, his thrust into the game at precisely the critical moment,partook almost of the supernatural.

MacIver was the first to collect himself. “What do you advise?” he asked suppressedly.

“Don’t advance yet; rather a policy of evasion. First of all, get the king out of the danger line from g8 to h7. Then he’ll probably transfer his attack to the other flank. Then you parry that with the rook, c8 to c4; two moves and he will have lost not only a pawn but his superiority, and if you maintain your defensive properly you may be able to make it a draw. That’s the best you can get out of it.”

We gasped, amazed. The precision no less than the rapidity of his calculations dizzied us; it was as if he had been reading the moves from a printed page. For all that, this unsuspected turn by which, thanks to his cutting in, the contest with a world champion promised a draw, worked wonders. Animated by a single thought, we moved aside so as not to obstruct his observation of the board.

Again MacIver inquired: “The king, then; to h7?”

“Surely. The main thing is to duck.”

MacIver obeyed and we rapped on the glass. Czentovic came forward at his habitual even pace, his eyes swept the board and took in the countermove. Then he moved the pawn h2 to h4 on the king’s flank exactly as our unknown aid had predicted. Already the latter was whispering excitedly:

“The rook forward, the rook, to c4; then he’ll first have to cover the pawn. That won’t help him, though. Don’t bother about his pawns but attack with the knight c3 to d5, and the balance is again restored. Press the offensive instead of defending.”

We had no idea of what he meant. He might have been talking Chinese. But once under his spell MacIver did as he had been bidden. Again we struck the glass to recall Czentovic. This was the first time that he made no quick decision; instead he looked fixedly at the board. His eyebrows contracted involuntarily. Then he made his move, the one which our stranger had said he would, and turned to go. Yet before he started off something novel and unexpected happened. Czentovic raised his eyes and surveyed our ranks; plainly he wanted to ascertain who it was that offered such unaccustomed energetic resistance.

From this moment our excitement grew immeasurably. Thus far we had played without genuine hope, but now every pulse beat hotly at the thought of breaking Czentovic's cold disdain. Without loss of time our new friend had directed the next move and we were ready to call Czentovic back. My fingers trembled as I hit the spoon against the glass. And now we registered our first triumph. Czentovic, who hitherto had executed his purpose standing, hesitated, hesitated and finally sat down. He did this slowly and heavily, but that was enough to cancel—in a physical sense if in no other—the difference in levels that had previously obtained. We had necessitated his acknowledgment of equality, spatially at least. He cogitated long, his eyes resting immovably on the board so that one could scarcely discern the pupils under the heavy lids, and under the strained application his mouth opened gradually, which gave him a rather foolish look. Czentovic reflected for some minutes, then made a move and rose. At once our friend said half audibly:

“A stall! Well thought out! But don’t yield to it. Force an exchange, he’s got to exchange, then we’ll get a draw and not even the gods can help him.”

MacIver did as he was told. The succeeding manoeuvres between the two men—we others had long since become mere supernumeraries—consisted of a back-and-forth that we were unable to comprehend. After some seven moves Czentovic looked up after a period of silence and said, “Draw.”

For a moment a total stillness reigned. Suddenly one heard the rushing of the waves and the jazzing radio in the adjacent drawingroom; one picked out every step on the promenade outside and the faint thin susurration of the wind that carried through the windowframes. None of us breathed; it had come upon us too abruptly and we were nothing less than frightened in the face of the impossible: that this stranger should have been able to force his will on the world champion in a contest already half lost. MacIver shoved himself back and relaxed, and his suppressed breathing became audible in the joyous “Ah” that passed his lips. I took another look at Czentovic. It had already seemed to me during the later moves that he grew paler. But he understood how to maintain his poise. He persisted in his apparent imperturbability and asked, in a negligent tone, the while he pushed the figures off the board with a steady hand:

“Would you like to have a third game, gentlemen?”

The question was matter-of-fact, just business. What was noteworthy was that he ignored MacIver and looked straight and intently into the eyes of our rescuer. Just as a horse takes a new rider’s measure by the firmness of his seat, he must have become cognizant of who was his real, in fact his only, opponent. We could not help but follow his gaze and look eagerly at the unknown. However, before he could collect himself and formulate an answer, MacIver in his eager excitement, had already cried to him in triumph:

“Certainly, no doubt about it! But this time you’ve got to play him alone! You against Czentovic!”

What followed was quite extraordinary. The stranger, who curiously enough was still staring with a strained expression at the bare board, became affrighted upon hearing the lusty call and perceiving that he was the centre of observation. He looked confused.

“By no means, gentlemen,” he said halting, plainly perplexed.“Quite out of the question. You’ll have to leave me out. It’s twenty, no, twenty-five years since I sat at a chess-board and...and I’m only now conscious of my bad manners in crashing into your game without so much as a by your leave....Please excuse my presumption. I don’t want to interfere further.” And before we could recover from our astonishment he had left us and gone out.

“But that’s just impossible!” boomed the irascible MacIver, pounding with his fist. “Out of the question that this fellow hasn’t played chess for twenty-five years. Why, he calculated every move, every counter move, five or six in advance. You can’t shake that out of your sleeve. Just out of the question—isn’t it?”

Involuntarily, MacIver turned to Czentovic with the last question. But the champion preserved his unalterable frigidity.

“It’s not for me to express an opinion. In any case there was something queer and interesting about the man’s game; that’s why I purposely left him a chance.”

With that he rose lazily and added, in his objective manner: “If he or you gentlemen should want another game to-morrow, I’m at your disposal from three o’clock on.”

We were unable to suppress our chuckles. Everyone of us knew that the chance which Czentovic had allowed his nameless antagonist had not been prompted by generosity and that the remark was no more than a childish ruse to cover his frustration. It served to stimulate the more actively our desire to witness the utter humbling of so unshakable an arrogance. All at once we peaceable, indolent passengers were seized by a mad ambitious will to battle, for the thought that just on our ship, in mid ocean, the palm might be wrested from the champion—a record that would be flashed to every news agency in the world—fascinated us challengingly. Added to that was the lure of the mysterious which emanated from the unexpected entry of our saviour at the crucial instant, and the contrast between his almost painful modesty and the rigid self-consciousness of the professional. Who was this unknown? Had destiny utilized this opportunity to command the revelation of a yet undiscovered chess phenomenon? Or was it that we were dealing with an expert, who, for some undisclosed reason, craved anonymity? We discussed these various possibilities excitedly; the most extreme hypotheses were not sufficiently extreme to reconcile the stranger’s puzzling shyness with his surprising declaration in the face of his demonstrated mastery. On one point, however, we were of one mind:to forgo no chance of a renewal of the contest. We resolved to exert ourselves to the limit to induce our godsend to play Czentovic the next day, MacIver pledging himself to foot the bill. Having in the meantime learned from the steward that the unknown was an Austrian, I, as his compatriot, was delegated to present our request.

Soon I found our man reclining in his deck-chair, reading. In the moment of approach I used the opportunity to observe him. The sharply-chiselled head rested on the cushion in a posture of slight exhaustion; again I was struck by the extraordinary colourlessness of the comparatively youthful face framed at the temples by glistening white hair, and I got the impression, I cannot say why, that this person must have aged suddenly. No sooner did I stand before him than he rose courteously and introduced himself by a name that was familiar to me as belonging to a highly respected family of old Austria. I remembered that a bearer of that name had been an intimate friend of Schubert, and that one of the old Emperor’s physicians-in-ordinary had belonged to the same family. Dr. B. was visibly dumbfounded when I stated our wish that he should take Czentovic on. It proved that he had no idea that he had stood his ground against a champion, let alone the most famous one in the world at the moment. For some reason this news seemed to make a special impression on him, for he inquired once and again whether I was sure that his opponent was truly a recognized holder of international honours. I soon perceived that this circumstance made my mission easier, but sensing his refined feelings, I considered it discreet to withhold the fact that MacIver would be a pecuniary loser in case of an eventual defeat. After considerable hesitation Dr. B. at last consented to a match, but with the proviso that my fellow-players be warned against putting extravagant hope in his expertness.

“Because,” he added with a clouded smile, “I really don’t know whether I have the ability to play the game according to all the rules. I assure you that it was not by any means false modesty that made me say that I hadn’t touched a chess-man since my college days, say more than twenty years. And even then I had no particular gifts as a player.”

This was said so simply that I had not the slightest doubt of its truth. And yet I could not but express wonderment at his accurate memory of the details of positions in games by many different masters;he must, at least, have been greatly occupied with chess theory. Dr. B. smiled once more in that dreamy way of his.

“Greatly occupied! Heaven knows it’s true enough that I have occupied myself with chess greatly. But that happened under quite special, I might say unique, circumstances. The story of it is rather complicated and it might go as a little chapter in the story of our agreeable epoch. Do you think you would have patience for half an hour...?”

He waved towards the deck-chair next to his, I accepted the invitation gladly. There were no near neighbours. Dr. B. removed his reading spectacles, laid them to one side, and began.

“You were kind enough to say that, as a Viennese, you remembered the name of my family. I am pretty sure, however, that you could hardly have heard of the law office which my father and I conducted—and later I alone—for we had no cases that got into the papers and we avoided new clients on principle. In truth, we no longer had a regular law practice but confined ourselves exclusively to advising, and mainly to administering the fortunes of the great monasteries with which my father, once a Deputy of the Clerical Party, was closely connected. Besides—in this day and generation I am no longer obliged to keep silence about the Monarchy—we had been entrusted with the investment of the funds of certain members of the Imperial family. These connections with the Court and the Church—my uncle had been the Emperor’s household physician, another was an abbot in Seitenstetten—dated back two generations; all we had to do was to maintain them, and the task allotted to us through this inherited confidence—a quiet, I might almost say a soundless, task—really called for little more than strict discretion and dependability, two qualities which my late father possessed in full measure; he succeeded, in fact, through his prudence in preserving considerable values for his clients through the years of inflation as well as the period of collapse. Then, when Hitler seized the helm in Germany and began to raid the properties of churches and cloisters, certain negotiations and transactions, initiated from the other side of the frontier with a view to saving at least the movable valuables from confiscation, went through our hands and we two knew more about sundry secret transactions between the Curia and the Imperial house than the public will ever learn of. But the very inconspicuousness of our office—we hadn’t even a sign on the door—as well as the care with which both of us almost ostentatiously kept out of Monarchist circles, offered the safest protection from officious investigations. In fact, no Austrian official had ever suspected that during all those years the secret couriers of the Imperial family delivered and fetched their most important mail in our unpretentious fourth floor office.

“It happened that the National Socialists began, long before they armed their forces against the world, to organize a different but equally schooled and dangerous army in all contiguous countries—the legion of the unprivileged, the despised, the injured. Their so-called ‘cells’ nested themselves in every office, in every business; they had listening-posts and spies in every spot, right up to the private chambers of Dollfuss and Schuschnigg. They had their man, as alas! I learned only too late, even in our insignificant office. True, he was nothing but a wretched, ungifted clerk whom I had engaged, on the recommendation of a priest, for no other purpose than to give the office the appearance of a going concern;all that we really used him for were innocent errands, answering the telephone, and filing papers, that is to say papers of no real importance. He was not allowed to open the mail. I typed important letters myself and kept no copies. I took all essential documents to my home, and I held private interviews nowhere but in the priory of the cloister or in my uncle’s consultation-room. The measures of caution prevented the listening-post from seeing anything that went on; but some unlucky happening must have made the vain and ambitious fellow aware that he was mistrusted and that interesting things were going on behind his back. It may have been that in my absence one of the couriers made a careless reference to ‘His Majesty’ instead of the stipulated ‘Baron Fern,’ or that the rascal opened letters surreptitiously. Whatever the reason, before I had so much as suspected him he managed to get a mandate from Berlin or Munich to watch us. It was only much later, long after my imprisonment began, that I remembered how his early laziness at work had changed in the last few months to a sudden eagerness when he frequently offered, almost intrusively, to post my letters. I cannot acquit myself of a certain amount of imprudence, but after all, haven’t the greatest diplomats and generals of the world too been out-maneuvered by Hitler’s cunning? Just how precisely and lovingly the Gestapo had long been directing its attention to me was manifested tangibly by the fact that the S.S. people arrested me on the evening of the very day of Schuschnigg’s abdication, and a day before Hitler entered Vienna. Luckily I had been able to burn the most important documents upon hearing Schuschnigg’s farewell address over the radio, and the other papers, along with the indispensable vouchers for the securities held abroad for the cloisters and two archdukes, I concealed in a basket of laundry which my faithful housekeeper took to my uncle. All of this almost literally in the last minute before the fellows stove my door in.”

Dr. B. interrupted himself long enough to light a cigar. I noticed by the light of the match a nervous twitch at the right corner of his mouth that had struck me before and which, as far as I could observe, recurred every few minutes. It was merely a fleeting vibration, hardly stronger than a breath, but it imparted to the whole face a singular restlessness.

I suppose you expect that I’m going to tell you about concentration camp to which all who held faith with our old Austria were removed;about the degradations, martyrings and tortures that I suffered there. Nothing of the kind happened. I was in a different category. I was not put with those luckless ones on whom they released their accumulated resentment by corporal and spiritual degradation, but rather was assigned to that small group out of which the National Socialists hoped to squeeze money or important information. My obscure person in itself meant nothing to the Gestapo, of course. They must have guessed, though, that were the dummies, the administrators and confidants, of their most embittered adversaries, and what they expected to compel from me was incriminating evidence, evidence against the monasteries to support charges of violation by those who had selflessly taken up the cudgels for the Monarchy. They suspected, and not without good reason, that a substantial portion of the funds that we handled was still secreted and inaccessible to their lust for loot—hence their choice of me on the very first day in order to force the desired information by their trusted methods. That is why persons of my sort, to whom they looked for money or significant evidence, were not dumped into a concentration camp but were sorted out for special handling. You will recall that our Chancellor, and also Baron Rothschild, from whose family they hoped to extort millions, were not planted behind barbed wire in a prison camp but, ostensibly privileged, were lodged in individual rooms in a hotel, the Metropole, which happened to be the Gestapo headquarters; the same distinction was bestowed on my insignificant self.

“A room to oneself in a hotel—sounds pretty descent doesn’t it? But you may believe me that they had not in mind a more decent but a more crafty technique when, instead of stuffing us ‘prominent’ ones in blocks of twenty into icy barracks, they housed us in tolerably heated hotel rooms, each by himself. For the pressure by which they planned to compel the needed testimony was to be exerted more subtly than through common beating or physical torture: by the most conceivably complete isolation. They did nothing to us; they merely deposited us in the midst of nothing, knowing well that of all things the most potent pressure on the soul of man is nothingness. By placing us singly, each in an utter vacuum, in a chamber that was hermetically closed to the world without, it was calculated that the pressure created from inside, rather than cold and the scourge, would eventually cause our lips to spring apart.

“The first sight of the room allotted to me was not at all repellent. There was a door, a table, a bed, a chair, a wash-basin, a barred window. The door, however, remained closed night and day; the table remained bare of book, newspaper, pencil, paper; the window gave on a brick wall; my ego and my physical self were contained in a structure of nothingness. They had taken every object from me: my watch, that I might not know the hour; my pencil, that I might not make a note; my pocket-knife, that I might not sever a vein; even the slight narcotic of a cigarette was forbidden me. Except for the warder, who was not permitted to address me or to answer a question, I saw no human face, I heard no human voice. From dawn to night there was no sustenance for eye or ear or any sense; I was alone with myself, with my body and four or five inanimate things, rescuelessly alone with table, bed, window, and basin. One lived like a diver in his bell in the black ocean of this silence—like a diver, too, who is dimly aware that the cable to safety has already snapped and that he never will be raised from the soundless depths. There was nothing to do, nothing to hear, nothing to see; about me; everywhere and without interruption, there was nothingness, emptiness without space or time. I walked to and fro, and with me went my thoughts to and fro, to and fro, ever again. But even thoughts, insubstantial as they seem require an anchorage if they are not to revolve and circle around themselves; they too weigh down under nothingness. One waited for something from morn to eve and nothing happened. Nothing happened. One waited, waited, waited; one thought, one thought, one thought until one’s temples smarted. Nothing happened. One remained alone. Alone. Alone.

“That lasted for a fortnight, during which I lived outside of time, outside the world. If war had broken out then I would never have discovered it, for my world comprised only table, door, bed, basin, chair, window and wall every line of whose scalloped pattern embedded itself as with a steel graver in the innermost folds of my brain every time it met my eye. Then, at last, the hearings began. Suddenly I received a summons; I hardly knew whether it was day or night. I was called and led through a few corridors, I knew not whither; then I waited and knew not where it was, and found myself standing at a table behind which some uniformed men were seated. Piles of papers on the table, documents of whose contents I was in ignorance; and then came the questions, the real ones and the false, the simple and the cunning, the catch questions and the dummy questions; and whilst I answered, strange and evil fingers toyed with papers whose contents I could not surmise, and strange evil fingers wrote a record and I could not know what they wrote. But the most fearsome thing for me at those hearings was that I never could guess or figure out what the Gestapo actually knew about the goings on in my office and what they sought to worm out of me. I have already told you that at the last minute I gave my housekeeper the really incriminating documents to take to my uncle. Had he received them? Had he not received them? How far had I been betrayed by that clerk? Which letters had they intercepted and what might they not already have screwed out of some clumsy priest at one of the cloisters which we represented?

“And they heaped question on question. What securities had I bought for this cloister, with which banks had I corresponded, do I know Mr. So-and-so or do I not, had I corresponded with Switzerland and with God-knows-where? And not being able to divine what they had already dug up, every answer was fraught with danger. Were I to admit something that they didn’t know I might be unnecessarily exposing somebody to the axe, if I denied too much I harmed myself.

“The worst was not the examination. The worst was the return from the examination to my void, to the same room with the same table,the same bed, the same basin, the same wall-paper. No sooner was I by myself than I tried to recapitulate, to think of what I should have said and what I should say next time so as to divert any suspicion that a careless remark of mine might have aroused. I pondered, I combed through, I probed, I appraised every single word of testimony before the examining officers. I restated their every question and every answer that I made. I sought to sift out the part that went into the protocol, knowing well that it was all incalculable and unascertainable. But these thoughts, once given rein in empty space, rotated in my head unceasingly, always starting afresh in ever-changing combinations and insinuating themselves into my sleep.

“After every hearing by the Gestapo my own thoughts took over no less inexorably the martyrizing questions, searchings and torments, and perhaps even more horribly, for the hearings at least ended after an hour, but this repetition, thanks to the spiteful torture of solitude, ended never. And always the table, chest, bed, wallpaper, window;no diversion, not a book or magazine, not a new face, no pencil with which to jot down an item, not a match to toy with—nothing, nothing, nothing. It was only at this point that I apprehended how devilishly intelligently, with what murderous psychology, this hotel-room system was conceived. In a concentration camp one would, perhaps, have had to wheel stones until one’s hands bled and one’s feet froze in one’s boots; one would have been packed in stench and cold with a couple of dozen others. But one would have seen faces, would have had space, a tree, a star, something, anything, to stare at, while here everything stood before one unchangeably the same, always the same, maddeningly the same. There was nothing here to switch me off from my thoughts, from my delusive notions, from my diseased recapitulating. That was just what they purposed: they wanted me to gag and gag on my thoughts until they choked me and I had no choice but to spit them out at last, to admit-admit everything that they were after, finally to yield up the evidence and the people.

“I gradually became aware of how my nerves were slacking under the grisly pressure of the void and, conscious of the danger, I tensed myself to the bursting point in an effort to find or create any sort of diversion. I tried to recite or reconstruct everything I had ever memorized in order to occupy myself—the folk songs and nursery rhymes of childhood, the Homer of my high-school days, clauses from the Civil Code. Then I did problems in arithmetic, adding or dividing, but my memory was powerless without some integrating force. I was unable to concentrate on anything. One thought flickered and darted about: how much do they know? What is it that they don’t know? What did I say yesterday—what ought I to say next time?

“This simply indescribable state lasted four months. Well, four months; easy to write, just about a dozen letters! Easy to say, too: four months, a couple of syllables. The lips can articulate the sound in a quarter of a second: four months. But nobody can describe or measure or demonstrate, not to another or to himself, how long a period endures in the spaceless and timeless, nor can one explain to another how it eats into and destroys one, this nothing and nothing and nothing that is all about, everlastingly this table and bed and basin and wall-paper, and always that silence, always the same warder who shoves the food in without looking at one, always those same thoughts that revolve around one in the nothingness, until one becomes insane.

“Small signs made me disturbedly conscious that my brain was not working right. Early in the game my mind had been quite clear at the examinations; I had testified quietly and deliberately; my twofold thinking—what should I say and what not?—had still functioned. Now I could no more than articulate haltingly the simplest sentences, for while I spoke my eyes were fixed in a hypnotic stare on the pen that sped recordingly across the paper as if I wished to race after my own words. I felt myself losing my grip, I felt that the moment was coming closer and closer when, to rescue myself, I would tell all I knew and perhaps more; when, to elude the strangling grip of that nothingness, I would betray twelve persons and their secrets without deriving any advantage myself but the respite of a single breath.

“One evening I really reached that limit: the warder had just served my meal at such a moment of desperation when I suddenly shrieked after him: ‘Take me to the Board! I’ll tell everything! I want to confess! I’ll tell them where the papers are and where the money is! I’ll tell them everything! Everything!’ Fortunately he was far enough away not to hear me. Or perhaps he didn’t want to hear me.

“An event occurred in this extremest need, something unforeseeable, that offered rescue, rescue if only for a period. It was late in July, a dark, ominous, rainy day: I recall these details quite definitely because the rain was rattling against the windows of the corridor through which I was being led to the examination. I had to wait in the ante-room of the audience chamber. Always one had to wait before the session; the business of letting one wait was a trick of the game. They would first rip one’s nerves by the call, the abrupt summons from the cell in the middle of the night, and then, by the time one was keyed to the ordeal with will and reason tensed to resistance, they caused one to wait, meaningless meaningful waiting, an hour, two hours, three hours before the trial, to weary the body and humble the spirit. And they caused me to wait particularly long on this Thursday, the 27th of July; twice the hour struck while I attended, standing, in the ante-room; there is a special reason, too, for my remembering the date so exactly.

“A calendar hung in this room—it goes without saying that they never permitted me to sit down; my legs bored into my body for two hours—and I find it impossible to convey to you how my hunger for something printed, something written, made me stare at these figures, these few words, ‘27 July,’ against the wall; I wolfed them into my brain. Then I waited some more and waited and looked to see when the door would open at last, meanwhile reflecting on what my inquisitors might ask me this time, knowing well that they would ask me something quite different from that for which I was schooling myself. Yet in the face of all that, the torment of the waiting and standing was nevertheless a blessing, a delight, because this room was, after all, a different from my own, somewhat larger and with two windows instead of one, and without the bed and without the basin and without that crack in the window-sill that I had regarded a million times. The door was painted differently, a different chair stood against the wall, and to the left stood a filing cabinet with documents as well as a clothes—stand on which three or four wet militia coats hung—my torturers’ coats. So that I had something; new, something different to look at, at last something different for my starved eyes, and they clawed greedily at every detail.

“I took in every fold of those garments; I observed for example, a drop suspended from one of the wet collars and, ludicrous as it may sound to you, I waited in an inane excitement to see whether the drop would eventually detach itself and roll down or whether it would resist gravity and stay put; truly, this drop held me breathless for minutes, as if my life had been at stake. It rolled down after all, and then I counted the buttons on the coats again, eight on one, eight on another, ten on the third, and again I compared the rank marks; all of these absurd and unimportant trifles toyed with, teased, and pinched my hungry eyes with an avidity which I forgo trying to describe. And suddenly I saw something that paralysed my gaze. I had discovered a slight bulge in the side-pocket of one of the coats. I moved closer to it and thought that I recognized, by the rectangular shape of the protrusion, what this swollen pocket harboured: a book! My knees trembled: a book!

“I hadn’t had a book in my hand for four months, so that the mere idea of a book in which words appear in orderly arrangement, of sentences, pages, leaves, a book in which one could follow and stow in one’s brain new, unknown, diverting thoughts, was at once intoxicating and stupefying.

Hypnotized, my eyes rested on the little swelling which the book inside the pocket formed; they glowered at the spot as if to burn a hole in the coat. The moment came when I could no longer control my greed;involuntarily I edged nearer. The mere thought that my hands might at least feel the book through the cloth made the nerves of my fingers tingle to the nails. Almost without knowing what I did, I found myself getting closer to it.

“Happily the warder ignored my singular behaviour; indeed it may have seemed to him quite natural that a man wanted to lean against a wall, after standing erect for two hours. And then I was quite close to the coat, my hands purposely clasped behind me so as to be able to touch the coat unnoticed. I felt the stuff and the contact confirmed that here was something square, something flexible, and that it crackled softly-book, a book! And then a thought went through me like a shot:steal the book! If you can turn the trick, you can hide the book in your cell and read, read, read-read again at last. The thought, hardly lodged in me, operated like a strong poison; at once there was a singing in my ears, my heart hammered, my hands froze and resisted my bidding. But after that first numbness I pressed myself softly and insinuatingly against the coat; I pressed—always fixing the warder with my eye—the book up out of the pocket, higher and higher, with my artfully concealed hands. Then: a tug, a gentle, careful pull, and in no time the little book was in my hand. Not until now was I frightened at my deed. Retreat was no longer possible. What to do with it? I shoved the book under my trousers at the back just far enough for the belt to hold it, then gradually to the hip so that while walking I could keep it in place by holding my hands on the trouser-seams, military fashion. I had to try it out, so I moved a step from the clothes-stand, two steps, three steps. It worked. It was possible to keep the book in place while walking if I but kept pressing firmly against my belt.

“Then came the hearing. It demanded greater attention than ever on my part, for while answering I concentrated my entire effort on securing the book inconspicuously rather than on my testimony. Luckily this session proved to be a short one and I got the book safely to room, though it slipped into my trousers most dangerously while in the corridor on my way back and I had to simulate a violent fit of coughing as an excuse for bending over to get it under my belt again. But what a moment; that, as I bore it back into my inferno, alone at last yet no longer alone!

“You will suppose, of course, that my first act was to seize the book, examine it and read it. Not at all! I wanted, first of all, to savour the joy of possessing a book; the artificially prolonged and nerveinflaming desire to day-dream about the kind of book I would wish this stolen one to be: above all, very small type, narrowly spaced, with many, many letters, many, many thin leaves so that it might take long to read. And then I wished to myself that it might be one that would demand mental exertion, nothing smooth or light; rather something from which I could learn and memorize, preferably—oh, what an audacious dream!—Goethe or Homer. At last I could no longer check my greed and my curiosity. Stretched on the bed so as to arouse no suspicion in case the warder might open the door without warning, tremblingly I drew the volume from under my belt.

“The first glance produced not merely disappointment but a sort of bitter vexation, for this booty, whose acquirement was surrounded with such monsterous danger and such glowing hope, proved to be nothing more than a chess anthology, a collection of one hundred and fifty championship games. Had I not been barred, locked in, I would in my first rage, have thrown the thing through an open window; for what was to be done—what could be done—with nonsense of the kind? Like most of the other boys at school, I had now and then tried my hand at chess to kill time. But of what use was this theoretical stuff to me? You can’t play chess alone, and certainly not without chess-men and a board. Annoyed I thumbed the pages, thinking to discover reading matter of some sort, an introduction, a manual; but besides the bare rectangular reproductions of the various master games with their symbols a1-a2, Kt.-f1-Kt.-g3, etc.-to me then unintelligible, I found nothing. All of it appeared to me as a kind of algebra the key to which was hidden. Only gradually I puzzled out that the letters a, b, c stood for the vertical rows, the figures 1 to 8 for the rows across, and indicated the current position of each figure; thus these purely graphic expressions did, nevertheless, attain to speech.

“Who knows, I thought, if I were able to devise a chess-board in my cell I could follow these names through; and it seemed like a sign from heaven that the weave of my bedspread disclosed a coarse checker-work. With proper manipulation it yielded a field of sixty-four squares. I tore out the first leaf and concealed the book under my mattress. Then, from bits of bread that I sacrificed, I began to mould king, queen, and the other figures (with ludicrous results, of course), and after no end of effort I was finally able to undertake on the bedspread the reproduction of the positions pictured in the chess book. But my absurd bread-crumb figures, half of which I had covered with dust to differentiate them from ‘white’ ones, proved utterly inadequate when I tried to pursue the printed game. I was all confusion in those first days; I would have to start a game afresh five times, ten times, twenty times. But who on earth had so much unused and useless time as I, slave of emptiness, and who commanded so much immeasurable greed and patience!

“It took me six days to play the game to the end with out an error, and in a week after that I no longer required the chess-men to comprehend the relative positions and in just one more week I was able to dispense with the bedspread; the printed symbols, a1, a2, c7, c8, at first abstractions to me, automatically transformed themselves into visual plastic positions. The transposition had been accomplished perfectly. I had projected the chess-board and its figures within myself and, thanks to the bare rules, observed the immediate set-up just as a practised musician hears all instruments singly and in combination upon merely glancing at a printed score.

“It cost me no effort, after another fortnight, to play every game in the book from memory or, in chess language, blind; and only then did I begin to understand the limitless benefaction which my impertinent theft constituted. For I had acquired an occupation—a senseless, a purposeless one if you wish—yet one that negated the nothingness that enveloped me; the one hundred and fifty championship games equipped me with a weapon against the strangling monotony of space and time.

“From then on, to conserve the charm of this new interest without interruption, I divided my day precisely: two games in the morning, two in the afternoon, a quick recapitulation in the evening. That served to fill my day which previously had been as shapeless as jelly; I had something to do that did not tire me, for a wonderful feature of chess is that through confining mental energy to a strictly bounded field the brain does not flag even under the most strained concentration; rather it makes more acute its agility and energy. In the course of time the repetition of the master games, which had at first been mechanical, awakened an artistic, a pleasurable comprehension in me. I learned to understand the refinements, the tricks and feints in attack and defence; I grasped the technique of thinking ahead, planning combinations and riposting, and soon recognized the personal note of each champion in his individual method as infallibly as one spots a particular poet on hearing only a few lines. That which began as a mere time-killing occupation became a joy, and the personalities of such great chess strategists as Alekhin, Lasker, Boguljobov and Tartakover entered into my solitude as beloved comrades.

“My silent cell was constantly and variously peopled, and the very regularity of my exercises restored my already impaired intellectual capacity; my brain seemed refreshed and, because of constant disciplined thinking, even keenly whetted. My ability to think more clearly and concisely manifested itself, above all, at the hearings;unconsciously I had perfected myself at the chess-board in defending myself against false threats and masked dodges, from this time on I gave them no openings at the sessions and I even harboured the thought that the Gestapo men began, after a while, to regard me with a certain respect. Possibly they asked themselves, seeing so many others collapse, from what secret sources I alone found strength for such unshakable resistance.

“This period of happiness in which I played through the one hundred and fifty games in that book systematically, day by day, continued for about two and a half to three months. Then I arrived unexpectedly at a dead point. Suddenly I found myself once more facing nothingness. For by the time that I had played through each one of these games innumerable times, the charm of novelty and surprise was lost, the exciting and stimulating power was exhausted. What purpose did it serve to repeat again and again games whose every move I had long since memorized? No sooner did I make an opening move than the whole thing unravelled of itself; there was no surprise, no tension, no problem. At this point I would have needed another book with more games to keep me busy, to engage the mental effort that had become indispensable to divert me. This being totally impossible, my madness could take but one course: instead of the old games I had to devise new ones myself. I had to try to play the game with myself or, rather, against myself.

“I have no idea to what extent you have given thought to the intellectual status of this game of games. But one doesn’t have to reflect deeply to see that if pure chance can determine a game of calculation, it is an absurdity in logic to play against oneself. The fundamental attraction of chess lies, after all, in the fact that its strategy develops in different wise in two different brains, that in this mental battle Black,ignorant of White’s immediate manoeuvres, seeks constantly to guess and cross them, while White, for his part, strives to penetrate Black’s secret purposes and to outstrip and parry them. If one person tried to be both Black and White you have the preposterous situation that one and the same brain at once knows something and yet does not know it;that, functioning as White’s partner, it can instantly obey a command to forget what, a moment earlier as Black’s partner, it desired and plotted. Such cerebral duality really implies a complete cleavage of the conscious, a lighting up or dimming of the brain function at pleasure as with a switch; in short, to want to play against oneself at chess is about as paradoxical as to want to jump over one’s own shadow.

“Well, briefly, in my desperation I tried this impossibility, this absurdity, for months. There was no choice but this nonsense if I was not to become quite insane or slowly to disintegrate mentally. The fearful state that I was in compelled me at least to attempt this split between Black ego and White ego so as not to be crushed by the horrible nothingness that bore in on me.”

Dr. B. relaxed in his deck-chair and closed his eyes for a minute. It seemed as if he were exerting his will to suppress disturbing recollection. Once again the left corner of his mouth twitched in that strange and evidently uncontrollable manner. Then he settled himself a little more erectly.

“Well, then, I hope I’ve made it all pretty intelligible to this point. I’m sorry, but I doubt greatly that the rest of it can be pictured quite as clearly. This new occupation, you see, called for so unconditional a harnessing of the brain as to make any simultaneous self-control impossible. I have already intimated my opinion that chess contest with oneself spells nonsense, but there is a minimal possibility for even such an absurdity if a real chess-board is present, because the board, being tangible, affords a sense of distance, a material extraterritoriality. Before a real chess-board with real chessmen you can stop to think things over, and you can place yourself physically first on this side of the table, then on the other, to fix in your eyes how the scene looks to Black and how it looks to White. Obliged as I was to conduct these contests against myself—or with myself, as you please—on an imaginary field, so I was obliged to keep fixedly in mind the current set-up on the sixty four squares, and besides, to make advance calculations as to the possible further moves open to each player, which meant—I know how mad this must sound to you—imagining double, triply, no, imagining sextuply, duodecibly for each one of my egos, always four or five moves in advance.

“Please don’t think that I expect you to follow through the involutions of this madness. In these plays in the abstract space of fantasy I had to figure out the next four or five moves in my capacity of White, likewise as Black, thus considering every possible future combination with two brains, so to speak, White’s brain and Black’s brain. But even this auto-cleaving of personality was not most dangerous aspect of my abstruse experiment; rather it was that with the need to play independently I lost my foothold and fell into a bottomless pit. Then mere replaying of championship games, which I had been indulging in during the preceding weeks, had been, after all, no more than a feat of repetition, a straight recapitulation of given material and, as such, no greater strain than to memorize poetry or learn sections of the Civil Code by heart; it was a delimited, disciplined function and thus an excellent mental exercise. My two morning games, my two in the afternoon, represented a definite task that I was able to perform coolly; it was a substitute for normal occupation and, moreover, if I erred in the progress of a game or forgot the next move, I always had recourse to the book. It was only because the replaying of others’ games left my self out of the picture that this activity served to soothe and heal my shattered nerves; it was all one to me whether Black or White was victor, for was it not Alekhin or Boguljobov who sought the palm, while my own person, my reason, my soul derived satisfaction as observer, as fancier of the niceties of those jousts as they worked out. From the moment at which I tried to play against myself I began, unconsciously, to challenge myself. Each of my egos, my Black ego and my White ego, had to contest against the other and become the centre, each on its own, of an ambition, an impatience to win, to conquer, after each move that I made as Ego Black I was in a fever of curiosity as to what Ego White would do. Each of my egos felt triumphant when the other made a bad move and likewise suffered chagrin at similar clumsiness of its own.

“All that sounds senseless, and in fact such a self-produced schizophrenia, such a split consciousness with its fund of dangerous excitement, would be unthinkable in a person under normal conditions. Don’t forget, though that I had been violently torn from all normality, innocently charged and behind bars, for months martyrized by the refined employment of solitude—a man seeking an object against which to discharge his long-accumulated rage. And as I had nothing else than this insane match with myself, that rage, that lust for revenge, canalized itself fanatically into the game. Some-thing in me wanted to justify itself, but there was only this other self with which I could wrestle; so while the game was on, an almost maniac excitement waxed in me. In the beginning my deliberations were still quiet and imposed; I would pause between one game and the next so as to recover from the effort;but little by little my frayed nerves forbade all respite. No sooner had Ego White made a move than Ego Black feverishly plunged a piece forward; scarcely had a game ended but I challenged myself to another, for each time, of course, one of my chess-egos was beaten by the other and demanded satisfaction.

“I shall never be able to tell, even approximately, how many games I played against myself during those months in my cell as a result of this crazy insatiability; a thousand perhaps, perhaps more. It was an obsession against which I could not arm myself; from dawn to night I thought of nothing but knights and pawns, rooks and kings, and a b and c, and ‘Mate!’ and ‘Castle’; my entire being and every sense embraced the checkered board. The joy of play became a lust for play;the lust for play became a compulsion to play, a frenetic rage, a mania which saturated not only my waking hours but eventually my sleep, too. I could think only in terms of chess, only in chess moves, chess problems; sometimes I would wake with a damp brow and become aware that a game had unconsciously continued in my sleep, and if I dreamt of persons it was exclusively in the moves of the bishop, the rook in the advance and retreat of the knight’s move.

“Even when I was brought before the examining Board I was no longer able to keep my thoughts within the bounds of my responsibilities; I’m inclined to think that I must have expressed myself confusedly at the last sessions, for my judges would glance at one another strangely. Actually I was merely waiting, while they questioned and deliberated, in my cursed eagerness to be led back to my cell so that I could resume my mad round, to start a fresh game, and another and another. Every interruption disturbed me; even the quarter-hour in which the warder cleaned up the room, the two minutes in which he served my meals, tortured my feverish impatience; sometimes the midday meal stood untouched on the tray at evening because the game made me forgetful of food. The only physical sensation that I experienced was a terrible thirst; the fever of this constant thinking and playing must already have manifested itself then; I emptied the bottle in two swallows and begged the warder for more, and nevertheless felt my tongue dry in my mouth in the next minute.

“Finally my excitement during the games rose—by that time I did nothing else from morning till night—to such a height that I was no longer able to sit still for a minute; uninterruptedly, while cogitating on a move, I would walk to and fro, quicker and quicker, to and fro, to and fro, and the nearer the approach to the decisive moment of the game the hotter my steps; the lust to win, to victory, to victory over myself increased to a sort of rage; I trembled with impatience, for the one chess-ego in me was always too slow for the other. One would whip the other forward and, absurd as this may seem to you, I would call angrily,‘quicker, quicker!’ or ‘Go on, go on!’ when the one self in me failed to riposte to the other’s thrust quickly enough. It goes without saying that I am now fully aware that this state of mine was nothing less than a pathological form of overwrought mind for which I can find no other name than one not yet known to medical annals: chess poisoning.

“The time came when this monomania, this obsession, attacked my body as well as my brain. I lost weight, my sleep was restless and disturbed, upon waking I had to make great efforts to compel my leaded lids to open; sometimes I was so weak that when I grasped a glass I could scarcely raise it to my lips, my hands trembled so; but no sooner did the game begin than a mad power seized me: I rushed up and down, up and down with fists clenched, and I would sometimes hear my own voice as through a reddish fog, shouting hoarsely and angrily at myself,‘Check!’ or ‘Mate!’

“How this horrible, indescribable condition reached its crisis is something that I am unable to report. All that I know is that I woke one morning and the waking was different from usual. My body was no longer a burden, so to speak; I rested softly and easily. A tight, agreeable fatigue, such as I had not known for months, lay on my eyelids; the feeling was so warm and benignant that I couldn’t bring myself to open my eyes. For minutes I lay awake and continued to enjoy this heavy soddenness, this tepid reclining in agreeable stupefaction. All at once I seemed to hear voices behind me, living human voices, low whispering voices that spoke words; and you can’t possibly imagine my delight, for months had elapsed, perhaps a year, since I had heard other words than the hard, sharp, evil ones from my judges. 'You’re dreaming,’ I said to myself. ‘You’re dreaming! Don’t, in any circumstances, open your eyes. Let the dream last or you’ll again see the cursed cell about you, the chair and wash-stand and the table and the wall-paper with the eternal pattern. You’re dreaming—keep on dreaming!’

But curiosity held the upper hand. Slowly and carefully I raised my lids. A miracle! It was a different room in which I found myself, a room wider and more ample than my hotel cell. An unbarred window emitted light freely and permitted a view of trees, green trees swaying in the wind, instead of my bald brick partition; the walls shone white and smooth, above above me a high white ceiling. I lay in a new and unaccustomed bed and—surely, it was no dream—human voices whispered behind me.

“In my surprise I must have made an abrupt, involuntary movement, for at once I heard an approaching step. A woman came softly, a woman with a white head-dress, a nurse, a Sister. A delighted shudder ran through me: I had seen no woman for a year. I stared at the lovely apparition, and it must have been a glance of wild ecstasy, for she admonished me, ‘quiet, don’t move.’ I hung only on her voice, for was not this a person who talked! Was there still somebody on earth who did not interrogate me, torture me? And to top it all—ungraspable wonder!—a soft, warm, almost tender woman’s voice. I stared hungrily at her mouth, for the year of inferno had made it seem to me impossible that one person might speak kindly to another. She smiled at me—yes, she smiled; then there still were people who could smile benevolently—put a warning finger to her lips, and went off noiselessly. But I could not obey her order; I was not yet sated with the miracle. I tried to wrench myself into a sitting posture so as to follow with my eyes this wonder of a human being who was kind. But when I reached out to support my weight on the edge of the bed something failed me. In place of my right hand, fingers, and wrist I became aware of something foreign—a thick, large, white cushion, obviously a comprehensive bandage. At first I gaped uncomprehendingly at this bulky object, then slowly I began to grasp where I was and to reflect on what could have happened to me. They must have injured me, or I had done some damage to my hand myself. The place was a hospital.

“The physician, an amiable elderly man, turned up at noon. He knew my family and made so genial an allusion to my uncle, the Imperial household doctor, as to create the impression that he was well disposed towards me. In the course of conversation he put all sorts of questions, one of which, in particular, astonished me: Was I a mathematician or a chemist? I answered in the negative.

“‘Strange,’ he murmured. ‘In your fever you cried out such unusual formulas, c3, c4. We could make nothing of it.’

“I asked him what had happened to me. He smiled oddly.

“‘Nothing too serious. An acute irritation of the nerves,’ and added in a low voice, after looking carefully around, ‘And quite intelligible, of course. Let’s see, it was March 13, wasn’t it!’

“I nodded.

“‘No wonder, with that system,’ he admitted. ‘You’re not the first. But don’t worry.’ The manner of his soothing speech and sympathetic smile convinced me that I was in a safe haven.

“A couple of days thereafter the doctor told me quite of his own accord what had taken place. The warder had heard shrieks from my cell and thought, at first, that I was disputing with somebody who had broken in. But no sooner had he shown himself at the door than I made for him, shouted wildly something that sounded like ‘Aren’t you ever going to move, you rascal, you coward?’ grasped at his windpipe, and finally attacked him so ferociously that he had to call for help. Then when they were dragging me, in my mad rage, for medical examination, I had suddenly broken loose and thrust myself against the window in the corridor, thereby lacerating my hand—see this deep scar. I had been in a sort of brain fever during the first few days in the hospital, but now he found my perceptive faculties quite in order. ‘To be sure,’ said he under his voice, it’s just as well that I don’t report that higher up or they may still come and fetch you back there. Depend on me, I’ll do my best.’

“Whatever it was that this benevolent doctor told my torturers about me is beyond my knowledge. In any case, he achieved what he sought to achieve: my release. It may be that he declared me irresponsible, or it may be that my importance to the Gestapo had diminished, for Hitler had since occupied Bohemia, thus liquidating the case of Austria. I had merely to sign an undertaking to leave the country within a fortnight, and this period was so filled with the multitude of formalities that now surround a journey—military certificate, police, tax and health certificates, passport, visas—as to leave me no time to brood over the past. Apparently one’s brain is controlled by secret, regulatory powers which automatically switch off whatever may annoy or endanger the mind, for every time I wanted to ponder on my imprisonment the light in my brain seemed to go off; only after many weeks, indeed only now, on this ship, have I plucked up enough courage to pass in review all that I lived through.

“After all this you will understand my unbecoming and perhaps strange conduct to your friends. It was only by chance that I was strolling through the smoking-room and saw them sitting at the chessboard; my feet seemed rooted where I stood from astonishment and fright. For I had totally forgotten that one can play chess with a real board and real figures, forgotten that two physically separate persons sit opposite each other at this game. Truly it took me a few minutes before I remembered that what those men were playing was what I had been playing, against myself during the months of my helplessness. The cipher-code which served me in my worthy exercises was but a substitute, a symbol for these solid figures; my astonishment that this pushing about of pieces on the board was the same as the imaginary fantastics in my mind must have been like that of an astronomer who, after complicated paper calculations as to the existence of a new planet, eventually really sees it in the sky as clear white, substantial body. I stared at the board as if magnetized, and saw there my setup, knight, rook, king, queen, and pawns, as genuine figures carved out of wood. In order to get the hang of the game I had voluntarily to transmute it from my abstract realm of numbers and letters into the movable figures. Gradually I was overcome with curiosity to observe a real contest between two players. Then followed that regrettable and impolite interference of mine with your game. But that mistaken move of your friend’s was like a stab at my heart. It was pure instinct that made me hold him back, a quite impulsive grasp like that with which one involuntarily seizes a child leaning over a banister. It was not until afterwards that I became conscious of the impropriety of my intrusiveness.”

I hastened to assure Dr. B. that we were all happy about the incident to which we owed his acquaintance and that, after what he had confided in me, I would be doubly interested in the opportunity to see him at tomorrow’s improvised tournament.

“Really, you mustn’t expect too much. It will be nothing but a test for me—a test whether I—whether I’m at all capable of dealing with chess in a normal way, in a game with a real board with substantial chess-men and a living opponent—for now I doubt more than ever that those hundreds, they may have been thousands, of games that I played were real games according to the rules, and not merely a sort of dreamchess, fever-chess, a delirium in which, as always in dreams, one skips intermediate steps. Surely you do not seriously believe that I would measure myself against a champion, that I expect to give tit for tat to the greatest one in the world. What interests and fascinates me is nothing but the humous curiosity to discover whether what went on in my cell was chess or madness, whether I was then at the dangerous brink or already beyond it—that’s all, nothing else.”

At this moment the gong summoning passengers to dinner was heard. The conversation must have lasted almost two hours, for Dr.B. had told me his story in much greater detail than that in which I assemble it. I thanked him warmly and took my leave. I had hardly covered the length of the deck when he was alongside me visibly nervous, saying with something of a stutter:

“One thing more. Will you please tell your friends beforehand, so that it should not later seem discourteous, that I will play only one game....The idea is merely to close an old account—a final settlement, not a new beginning....I can’t afford to sink back a second time into that passionate play-fever that I recall with nothing but horror. And besidesbesides, the doctor warned me, expressly warned me. Everyone who has ever succumbed to a mania remains for ever in jeopardy, and a sufferer from chess poisoning—even if discharged as cured—had better keep away from a chess-board. You understand, then—only this one experimental game for myself and no more.”

We assembled in the smoking-room the next day promptly at the appointed hour, three o’clock. Our circle had increased by yet two more lovers of the royal game, two ship’s officers who had obtained special leave from duty to watch the tourney. Czentovic, too, not as on the preceding day, was on time. After the usual choice of colours there began the memorable game this homo obscurissimus against the celebrated master.

I regret that it was played for thoroughly incompetent observers like us, and that its course is as completely lost to the annals of the art of chess as are Beethoven’s improvisations to music. True, we tried to piece it together from our collective memory on the following afternoons but in vain; very likely, in the passion of the moment we had allowed our interest to centre on the players rather than on the game. For the intellectual contrast between the contestants became physically plastic according to their manner as the play proceeded. Czentovic, the creature of routine, remained the entire time as immobile as a block, his eyes unalterably fixed on the board; thinking seemed to cost him almost physical effort that called for extreme concentration on the part of every organ. Dr. B., on the other hand, was completely slack and unconstrained. Like the true dilettante, in the best sense of the word, to whom only the play in play—the diletto—gives joy, he relaxed fully,explained moves to us in easy conversation during the early intervals, lighted a cigarette carelessly, and glanced at the board for a minute only when it came his turn to play. Each time it seemed as if he had expected just the move that his antagonist made.

The perfunctory moves came off quite rapidly. It was not until the seventh or eighth that something like a definite plan seemed to develop. Czentovic prolonged his periods of reflection; by that we sensed that the actual battle for the lead was setting in. But, to be quite frank, the gradual development of the situation represented to us lay observers, as usually in tournament games, something of a disappointment. The more the pieces wove themselves into a singular design the more impenetrable became the real lie of the land. We could not discern what one or the other rival purposed or which of the two had the advantage. We noticed merely that certain pieces insinuated themselves forward like levers to undermine the enemy front, but since every move of these superior players was part of a combination that comprised a plan for several moves ahead, we were unable to detect the strategy of their back-and-forth.

An oppressive fatigue took possession of us, largely because of Czentovic’s interminable cogitation between moves, which eventually produced visible irritation in our friend too. I observed uneasily now the longer the game stretched out, he became increasingly restless, moving about in his chair, nervously lighting a succession of cigarettes, occasionally seizing a pencil to make a note. He would order mineral water and gulp it down, glass after glass; it was plain that his mind was working a hundred times faster than Czentovic’s. Every time the latter, after endless reflection, decided to push a piece forward with his heavy hand, our friend would smile like one who encounters something long expected and make an immediate riposte. In his nimble mind he must have calculated every possibility that lay open to his opponent;the longer Czentovic took to make a decision the more his impatience grew, and during the waiting his lips narrowed into an angry and almost inimical line. Czentovic, however, did not allow himself to be hurried. He deliberated, stiff and silent, and increased the length of the pauses the more the field became denuded of figures. By the forty-second move, after one and a half hours, we sat limply by, almost indifferent to what was going on in the arena. One of the ship's officers had already departed, another was reading a book and would look up only when a piece had been moved. Then, suddenly at a move of Czentovic’s, the unexpected happened. As soon as Dr. B. perceived that Czentovic took hold of the bishop to move it, he crouched like a cat about to spring. His whole body trembled and Czentovic had no sooner executed his intention than he pushed his queen forward and said loudly and triumphantly, “There! That’s done with!”, fell back in his chair, his arms crossed over his breast and looked challengingly at Czentovic. As he spoke his pupils gleamed with a hot light.

Impulsively we bent over the board to figure out the significance of the move so ostentatiously announced. At first blush no direct threat was observable. Our friend’s statement, then, had reference to some development that we short-thoughted amateurs could not prefigure. Czentovic was the only one among us who had not stirred at the provocative call; he remained as still as if the insulting “Done with” had glanced of him unheard. Nothing happened. Everybody held his breath and at once the ticking of the clock that stood on the table to measure the moves became audible. Three minutes passed, seven minutes, eight minutes—Czentovic was motionless, but I thought I noticed an inner tension that became manifest in the greater distension of his thick nostrils.

This silent waiting seemed to be as unbearable to our friend as to us. He shoved his chair back, rose abruptly and began to traverse the smoking room, first slowly, then quicker and quicker. Those present looked at him wonderingly, but none with greater uneasiness than I, for I perceived that in spite of his vehemence this pacing never deviated from a uniform span; it was as if, in this awful space, he would each time come plump against an invisible cupboard that obliged him to reverse his steps. Shuddering, I recognized that it was an unconscious reproduction of the pacing in his erstwhile cell; during those months of incarceration it must have been exactly thus that he rushed to and fro, like a caged animal; his hands must have been clenched and his shoulders hunched exactly like this; it must have been like this that he pelted forward and back a thousand times there, the red lights of madness in his paralysed though feverish stare. Yet his mental control seemed still fully intact, for from time to time he turned impatiently towards the table to see if Czentovic had made up his mind. But time stretched to nine, then ten minutes.

What occurred then, at last, was something that none could have predicted. Czentovic slowly raised his heavy hand, which, until then, had rested inert on the table. Tautly we all watched for the upshot. Czentovic, however, moved no piece, but instead, with the back of his hand pushed, with one slow determined sweep, all the figures from the board. It took us a moment to comprehend: he gave up the game. He had capitulated in order that we might not witness his being mated. The impossible had come to pass: the champion of the world, victor at innumerable tournaments, had struck his colours before an unknown man, who hadn’t touched a chess-board for twenty or twenty-five years. Our friend the anonymous, the ignotus, had overcome the greatest chess master on earth in open battle.

Automatically, in the excitement, one after another rose to his feet;each was animated by the feeling that he must give vent to the joyous shock by saying or doing something. Only one remained stolidly at rest:Czentovic. After a measured interval he lifted his head and directed a stony look at our friend.

“Another game?” he asked.

“Naturally,” answered Dr. B. with an enthusiasm that was disturbing to me, and he seated himself, even before I could remind him of his own stipulation to play only once, and began to set up the figures in feverish haste. He pushed them about in such heat that a pawn twice slid from his trembling fingers to the floor; the pained discomfort that his unnatural excitement had already produced in me grew to something like fear. For this previously calm and quiet person had become visibly exalted; the twitching of his mouth was more frequent and in every limb he shook as with fever.

“Don’t,” I said softly to him. “No more now; you’ve had enough for to-day. It’s too much of a strain for you.”

“Strain! Ha!” and he laughed loudly and spitefully. “I could have played seventeen games during that slow ride. The only strain is for me to keep awake.—Well, aren’t you ever going to begin?”

These last words had been addressed in an impetuous, almost rude tone to Czentovic. The latter glanced at him quietly and evenly, but there was something of a clenched fist in that adamantine stubborn glance. On the instant a new element had entered: a dangerous tension a passionate hate. No longer were they two players in a sporting way; they were two enemies sworn to destroy each other. Czentovic hesitated long before making the first move, and I had a definite sensation that he was delaying on purpose. No question but that this seasoned tactician had long since discovered that just such dilatoriness wearied and irritated his antagonist. He used no less than four minutes for the normal, the simplest of openings, moving the king’s pawn two spaces. Instantly our friend advanced his king’s pawn, but again Czentovic was responsible for an eternal, intolerable pause; it was like waiting with beating heart for the thunder-clap after a streak of fiery lightning, and waiting—with no thunder forthcoming. Czentovic never stirred. He meditated quietly, slowly, and as I felt, increasingly, maliciously slowly—which gave me plenty of time to observe Dr. B. He had just about consumed his third glass of water; it came to my mind that he had spoken of his feverish thirst in his cell. Every symptom of abnormal excitement was plainly present: I saw his forehead grow moist and the scar on his hand become redder and more sharply outlined. Still, however, he held himself in rein. It was not until the fourth move, when Czentovic again pondered exasperatingly, that he forgot himself and exploded with, “Aren’t you ever going to move?”

Czentovic looked up coldly. “As I remember it, we agreed on a tenminute limit. It is a principle with me not to make it less.”

Dr. B. bit his lips. I noticed under the table the growing restlessness with which he lifted and lowered the sole of his shoe, and I could not control the nervousness the that overcame me because of the oppressive prescience of some insane thing that was boiling in him. As a matter of fact, there was a second encounter at the eighth move. Dr. B., whose self-control diminished with the increasing periods of waiting, could no longer conceal his tension; he was restless in his seat and unconsciously began to drum on the table with his fingers. Again Czentovic raised his peasant head.

“May I ask you not to drum. It disturbs me. I can’t play with that going on.”

“Ha, ha,” answered Dr. B. with a short laugh, “One can see that.”

Czentovic flushed. “What do you mean by that?” he asked, sharply and evilly.

Dr. B. gave another curt and spiteful laugh. “Nothing except that it’s plain that you’re nervous.”

Czentovic lowered his head and said nothing. Seven minutes elapsed before he made his move, and that was the funereal tempo at which the game dragged on. Czentovic became correspondingly stonier;in the end he utilized the maximum time before determining on a move, and from interval to interval the conduct of our friend became stranger and stranger. It appeared as if he no longer had any interest in the game but was occupied with something quite different. He abandoned his excited pacing and remained seated motionlessly. Starring into the void with a vacant and almost insane look, he uninterruptedly muttered unintelligible words; either he was absorbed in endless combinations or—and, this was my inner suspicion—he was working out quite other games, for each time that Czentovic got to the point, a move he had to be recalled from his absent state. Then it took a minute or two to orient himself. My conviction grew that he had really forgotten all about Czentovic and the rest of us in this cold aspect of his insanity which might at any instant discharge itself violently. Surely enough, at the nineteenth move the crisis came. No sooner had Czentovic executed his play than Dr. B., giving no more than a cursory look at the board, suddenly pushed his bishop three spaces forward and shouted so loudly that we all started.

“Check! Check, the king!”

Every eye was on the board in anticipation of an extraordinary move. Then, after a minute, there was an unexpected development. Very slowly Czentovic tilted his head and looked—which he had never done before—from one face to another. Something seemed to afford him a rich enjoyment, for little by little his lips gave expression to a satisfied and scornful smile. Only after he had savoured to the full the triumph which was still unintelligible to us did he address us, saying with mock deference:

“Sorry—but I see no check. Perhaps one of you gentlemen can see my king in check!”

We looked at the board and then uneasily over at Dr. B. Czentovic’s king was fully covered against the bishop by a pawn—a child could see that—thus the king could not possibly be in check. We turned one to the other. Might not our friend in his agitation have pushed a piece over the line, a square too far one way or the other? His attention arrested by our silence, Dr. B. now stared at the board and began, stutteringly:

“But the king ought to be on f7—that’s wrong, all wrong—Your move was wrong! All the pieces are misplaced-the pawn should be on g5 and not on g4. Why, that’s quite a different game – that’s—”

He halted abruptly. I had seized his arm roughly, or rather I had pinched it so hard that even in his feverish bewilderment he could not but feel my grip. He turned and looked at me like a somnambulist.

“What—what do you want?”

I only said “Remember!” at the same time lightly drawing my finger over the scar on his hand. Automatically he followed my gesture, his eyes fixed glassily on the blood-red streak. Suddenly he began to tremble and his body shook.

“For God’s sake,” he whispered with pale lips. “Have I said or done something silly? Is it possible that I’m again...?”

“No,” I said, in a low voice, “But you have to stop the game at once. It’s high time. Recollect what the doctor said.”

With a single movement Dr. B. was on his feet. “I have to apologize for my stupid mistake,” he said in his old, polite voice, inclining himself to Czentovic. “What I said was plain nonsense, of course. It goes without saying that the game is yours.” Then to us: “My apologies to your gentlemen, also. But I warned you beforehand not to expect too much from me. Forgive the disgrace-it is the last time that I yield to the temptation of chess.”

He bowed and left in the same modest and mysterious manner in which he had first appeared before us. I alone knew why this man would never again touch a chess-board, while the others, a bit confused, stood around with that vague feeling of having narrowly escaped something uncomfortable and dangerous. “Damned fool,” MacIver grumbled in his disappointment. Last of all, Czentovic rose from his chair, half glancing at the unfinished game.

“Too bad,” he said generously. “The attack wasn’t at all badly conceived. The man certainly has lots of talent for an amateur.”
