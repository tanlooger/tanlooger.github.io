第一章　卧室里的画


有一个男孩名叫尤斯塔斯·克拉伦斯·斯克罗布，他真的是名副其实[1]。他的父母叫他尤斯塔斯·克拉伦斯。他的老师叫他斯克罗布。我不知道他的朋友怎么叫他，因为他没有朋友。对于他的父母，他不称呼他们“父亲”和“母亲”，而是管他们叫哈罗德和艾伯塔。他们俩是很现代、很新潮的人。他们都是素食主义者，不抽烟，不喝酒，还穿一种特殊的内衣。他们家里的家具很少，床上没什么衣服，家里的窗户也总是开着。

尤斯塔斯·克拉伦斯喜欢动物，尤其是被钉在纸板上的甲虫尸体。他还喜欢看知识性的书，要是有插图就更好了，那些画着谷物升降机，或者一些肥胖的外国小孩在模范学校做操的书总是深得他心。

尤斯塔斯·克拉伦斯不喜欢他的表亲们，佩文西家的四个孩子——彼得、苏珊、艾德蒙和露西，但是听到艾德蒙和露西要来他家住一阵子时，他心里倒是欢喜得很，因为他内心深处其实很喜欢发号施令、恃强凌弱。虽然他个子矮小，打起架来连露西都敌不过，更别提艾德蒙了，但是他知道，作为主人，在自己家里要让客人不好过的法子可多着哩。

艾德蒙和露西并不想和哈罗德姨夫及艾伯塔姨妈住在一起，但是实在是没办法。那年夏天，他们的父亲要去美国讲学，得在那里待上十六个礼拜，母亲也跟着去了，因为她已经十年都没有真正的假期了。彼得在为一个考试刻苦努力，他即将和柯克教授一起度过假期，接受他的指导。在很久之前的战争时期，孩子们在柯克教授的大房子里曾经有过一段奇遇。如果柯克仍然住在那幢房子里，他准会让他们全住下。但是后来他不知怎的变穷了，住在一个小木屋里，只有一个空余的卧室。如果把其他三个孩子都带到美国去的话，花费就太大了，所以最后只有苏珊去了。

大人们觉得苏珊是家里最漂亮的那个，学校的功课又不好（虽然她年纪也不小了）。母亲说苏珊“去一趟美国能比两个小的收获更多”。艾德蒙和露西努力不去嫉妒苏珊的好运气，但是要在姨妈家度过一个暑假实在是太可怕了。“我更倒霉，”艾德蒙说，“起码你还有间自己的屋子，我却要和那个讨厌鬼尤斯塔斯住在一个房间里。”

故事要从一天下午说起，艾德蒙和露西好不容易能待在一起，享受难得的独处时光。他们谈论的当然是那个只属于他们的秘密国度——纳尼亚。我想我们之中的大多数都有一个自己的秘密国度，但大多都只是虚构的罢了。在这方面，艾德蒙和露西可比其他人幸运多了。他们的秘密国度是真实存在的，而且他们已经去了两次，不是在游戏中去的，也不是在梦里去的，而是在现实中真正地去了。当然，他们是通过魔法到那里的，也只有魔法才能把他们带到纳尼亚。他们承诺，差不多是承诺，有一天他们还会回到纳尼亚。所以你能想象，他们一逮到机会，就开始谈论纳尼亚的种种。

他们俩待在露西的房间里，坐在她的床边，盯着对面墙上的一幅画。这是他们在这个房子里唯一喜欢的一幅画了。艾伯塔姨妈一点儿也不喜欢这幅画（这就是为什么把它远远地放在楼上的小屋子里的原因），但是她又不能扔了它，因为这是一个她不想得罪的人送给她的结婚礼物。

这幅画画的是一艘船，那艘船正径直向你驶来。船头镀了一层金，就像一个张开大口的龙头。那艘船只有一根桅杆，扬着一张大大的方帆，帆的颜色是饱满艳丽的紫色。船的两侧——“龙”的镀金“双翼”——是绿色的。碧蓝的海水正把船推到浪尖，近处的滚滚浪潮裹着波纹和气泡，向你扑面而来。这艘船分明正乘风破浪，急速行进，左舷微微倾斜。（顺便说一句，如果你打算完整地读完这个故事，却还没弄清楚这是什么意思的话，你最好在脑中有这么一个概念：在船上向前面看，船的左侧是左舷，船的右侧是右舷。）阳光倾泻在船的左舷那一面，那一面的海水是碧绿中带着紫色。船的另一面，由于船的阴影投射下来，海水是深蓝色的。

“问题是，”艾德蒙说，“看着一艘纳尼亚的船，却不能去纳尼亚，是不是更糟糕？”

“看着也好啊，”露西说，“这艘船是地地道道的纳尼亚船啊。”

“还在玩你们的老游戏呢？”尤斯塔斯·克拉伦斯一直在门外偷听，现在笑嘻嘻地进来了。去年他在佩文西家住了一段时间，那时他偷听到了他们都在谈论纳尼亚，他还喜欢用这事来调侃他们。他当然觉得这些都是他们凭空编造出来的。他对这些故事不以为然，其实是因为他太蠢了，不会自己编故事。

“这里不欢迎你。”艾德蒙粗鲁地说。

“我想作一首打油诗，”尤斯塔斯说，“大概是这样的：

“有一群孩子天天谈论纳尼亚，

变得越来越古怪……”

“纳尼亚和古怪可不押韵。”露西说道。

“这叫半谐音[2]。”尤斯塔斯说。

“千万别问他半谐音是什么，”艾德蒙说，“他就是想要你问这个问题好让他显摆呢，你什么都不说，他反倒能识趣地走开。”

大多数男孩子遭受这样的对待时，都会选择走开或者发起怒来。尤斯塔斯可不会这样做。他就是咧着嘴笑，继续在这里晃来晃去，不一会儿又开始喋喋不休。

“你喜欢这幅画吗？”尤斯塔斯问道。

“拜托，千万不要让他开始说艺术什么的。”艾德蒙急忙说。

但是露西是个真诚的孩子，她已经开口回答了：“我喜欢，我非常喜欢这幅画。”

“这幅画烂透了。”尤斯塔斯说。

“你出去就看不到了。”艾德蒙说。

“你为什么喜欢这幅画？”尤斯塔斯问露西。

“嗯……”露西答道，“我喜欢这幅画是因为那艘船看起来就像真的在动，水也十分逼真，海浪看起来也像在上下翻涌。”

尤斯塔斯当然有不少话可以回答这个问题，但是他什么也没说。因为在他盯着这幅画的时候，那海浪看起来真的此起彼伏。他只坐过一次船（也只是到怀特岛），还晕了船。那画里的海浪让他又犯恶心了。他脸都绿了，试着再看了一眼那幅画。结果，三个孩子都对着那幅画看得目瞪口呆。

你这么读着书，可能会觉得他们看到的场景太难以置信，但是，就算亲眼见到，你也同样不会相信。画里的东西在动。那看起来也不像电影，因为颜色太逼真、太纯净了，就像是在露天的环境下一样。船头扎进海浪里，激起了一大朵浪花，然后又越过浪花，这才让船首次显现出了船尾和甲板。又一朵浪花迎面袭来，船头翘了起来，船尾和甲板又不见了。这时，原本一直好好地放在艾德蒙身旁床上的练习本开始哗啦啦地翻页，慢慢升空，直飞到他后面的墙上去了。露西的头发肆意地扫在她的脸旁，就像大风天里那样。这确实是一个大风天，但是风竟是从画里吹来的。随风而来的是阵阵响声——海浪发出的沙沙声、海水拍打船侧的啪啪声、船身发出的嘎吱声，还有狂风和海水那气势雄浑的咆哮声。而让露西真正相信她不是在做梦的是一股气味，那浓烈的咸涩的海水气味。

“停下！”尤斯塔斯气急败坏地吼道，声音里透露出恐惧和愤怒，“这又是你们玩的蠢把戏。停下，否则我要告诉艾伯塔了——哎哟！”

露西和艾德蒙可比他更习惯冒险。但是，就在尤斯塔斯叫了一声“哎哟”的时候，他们也像尤斯塔斯·克拉伦斯一样喊了一声“哎哟”。一大片又冷又咸的海水从画的右侧破框而出，不仅让他们浑身湿透，还让他们喘不过气来。

“我要砸了这烂东西！”尤斯塔斯尖叫着。几乎在同一时间，尤斯塔斯扑向那幅画，而艾德蒙从他身后跳起来，警告他小心一点儿别犯蠢，毕竟艾德蒙对魔法略知一二。露西从另一边抓住尤斯塔斯，却被拽着往前冲去。这时，不知是他们三人变小了还是那幅画变大了，尤斯塔斯跳起来想把画从墙上扯下来，却发现自己正站在画框上。在他面前的不是玻璃，而是真正的大海，海风和海浪像冲击石头一样冲击着画框。他吓得不知所措，抓住身边跳起来的艾德蒙和露西。他们挣扎着喊叫了一小会儿，正当他们觉得已经找到了平衡的时候，一个蓝色的巨浪从他们四周涌起，把他们都卷入了大海。海水灌进了尤斯塔斯的嘴里，他那绝望的叫喊顿时停止了。

露西暗自庆幸，还好她去年夏天努力学游泳。确实，如果用慢一点儿的划水动作，她会游得更好，而且那海水比在画上看起来可要冷多了。不过，她还是像所有穿着衣服落入深水的人的做法一样，保持冷静，踢掉鞋子。她紧闭着嘴，睁大眼睛。他们离船已经很近了，露西看到绿色的船舷高耸在他们上方，船上的人们站在甲板上看着她。然后，不出所料，尤斯塔斯在恐慌中一把抓住了她，两人一起沉入了大海。

他们重新浮上水面的时候，她看到一个白色的人影从船舷上跳入了水中。艾德蒙正在她近旁踩着水，抓着尤斯塔斯的双臂，尤斯塔斯还在大声号叫。这时，有个人从另一边伸出手臂托住了她，这个人似曾相识。船上有许多人在叫喊，船舷上人头攒动，有人从船上扔绳子下来。艾德蒙和那个陌生人正把绳子往她身上系。之后好像隔了很久，她的脸都发青了，牙齿也开始打战。而实际上这段时间没多久，他们只是在等待合适的时机把她送上船又不致让她在船边上磕碰。尽管他们已经拼尽全力，她站上甲板的时候膝盖上还是有了擦伤，身上湿漉漉的，全身瑟瑟发抖。接着，艾德蒙被拉了上来，再后面是悲惨的尤斯塔斯，最后是那个陌生人——一个比她年长几岁的金发男孩。

“凯……凯……凯斯宾！”露西喘过气来一声惊叹。原来是凯斯宾——凯斯宾是纳尼亚的年轻国王，他们上次来纳尼亚时帮助他登上了王位。艾德蒙也马上认出了他。他们三个人高兴坏了，满心愉快地相互握手，轻拍对方的后背。

“你这位朋友是谁？”凯斯宾立刻转过身来满面笑容地看着尤斯塔斯问道。与尤斯塔斯年龄相仿的男孩若是遇到这样浑身湿透的情况，都有理由哭闹一番，但是尤斯塔斯哭得尤其厉害，他大喊大叫：“让我走，让我回去，我不喜欢这样！”

“让你走？”凯斯宾说，“你能走去哪儿？”

尤斯塔斯冲到船舷上，期望看到那幅画的画框悬在海面上方，或是看一眼露西的房间。但是他看到的只有携着水沫的蓝色海浪，还有那淡蓝色的天空，一望无际。他沮丧无比，我们或许也没法责怪他。他立马感到一阵恶心。

“嘿！莱尼，”凯斯宾对一名船员说，“给两位陛下拿点儿香料酒。你们刚从水里上来，该喝点儿东西暖暖身子。”他用陛下来称呼艾德蒙和露西，是因为早在他之前，他们俩跟彼得和苏珊就是纳尼亚的国王和女王了。纳尼亚的时间和我们这里的时间不一样。如果你从这里去纳尼亚待上一百年，你回到我们这个世界的时候还是你离开那天的同一时间。如果你在这个世界待一周再回到纳尼亚，兴许在纳尼亚已经过去一千年了，也可能只过去了一天，又或者一点儿没变。你只有到了那里才知道。因此，上次佩文西家的孩子们第二次来到纳尼亚时，就像是（对纳尼亚的人们来说）亚瑟王返回英国的传说成真了一样。我觉得这样的事越快越好。

莱尼拿来了盛着热气腾腾的香料酒的酒壶和四个酒杯。这对他们来说真是再好不过了，露西和艾德蒙刚抿了一小口，就感觉温暖一直蔓延到了趾尖。可是尤斯塔斯一脸怪相，把酒一口喷了出来，他又觉得恶心了，开始放声大哭，问他们有没有丰树牌含维生素的营养食品，能不能用蒸馏水来调制，还坚持要在下一站下船。

“老兄，你可给我们带来了一个有趣的船员。”凯斯宾窃笑着对艾德蒙耳语道。但是他还没来得及继续说，尤斯塔斯又发作了。

“哎呀！啊！那是什么东西啊！快把那讨厌的东西带走！”

这次，他倒真有理由感到些许意外。确实有一只奇怪的东西从船尾的舱室里出来，正在慢慢地向他们走来。也许你可以叫它——事实上它确实是——一只老鼠。这只老鼠竟然用后腿站立，大约有两英尺高，头上戴着一个细细的金环，那金环绕过一边耳朵的下方，绕到另一边耳朵的上方，金环里插着一根长长的深红色羽毛。（因为老鼠毛色很深，差不多是黑色的，所以它这样的装束可以说是很大胆、很引人注目的了。）它的左爪搁在剑柄上，那把剑和它的尾巴差不多长。它在摇摇晃晃的甲板上庄严地走来，不仅走得很平稳，仪态还很优雅。露西和艾德蒙立马认出了他，他就是雷佩契普，纳尼亚会说话的走兽中最英勇的老鼠将领。他在第二次柏卢纳战役中赢得了不朽的荣誉。露西特别希望自己能把雷佩契普搂在怀里，抱抱他，她过去一直有这个想法。但是她很清楚，她永远没法享受这样的快乐，因为这会让雷佩契普深深地感到自己被冒犯了。所以，她单膝跪下来和他说话。

雷佩契普伸出他的左腿，缩回他的右腿，弯下腰亲吻了露西的手。站直后，他搓了搓自己的胡须，尖着嗓子说：

“恭迎女王陛下，恭迎艾德蒙国王。”他又鞠了一躬，“两位陛下的到来让这次伟大的冒险变得非常圆满。”

“啊，把这东西拿走，”尤斯塔斯号啕大哭，“我讨厌老鼠。我受不了会表演的动物，又愚蠢又粗俗，还自作多情。”

“我是不是该这么想，”雷佩契普盯着尤斯塔斯好一会儿之后对着露西说，“这个一点儿也不懂礼貌的人是受陛下保护的？因为，如果不是这样的话……”

这时露西和艾德蒙都打了个喷嚏。

“我真是太傻了，让你们湿漉漉地站在这儿，”凯斯宾说，“到下面来换身衣服。露西，我把我的房间让给你，但是我们船上恐怕没有女孩子的衣服。你得凑合穿我的衣服了。雷佩契普，好伙计，给我们带路吧。”

“为了方便一位女士，”雷佩契普说，“就算是自己的荣誉也要放在一边——至少暂时是这样的。”说到这里，他瞪了一眼尤斯塔斯。但是凯斯宾催促他们往前走，露西不一会儿就发现自己走到了船尾的舱室里。她立马就爱上了这里。从这里的三扇窗户向船尾看，那里是打着漩涡的蓝色海水。桌子的三侧围着几条长凳，凳子上放着衬垫，头顶吊着精美的银灯（她一下子就认出这是矮人的手艺，因为它太精致了），门上方的墙上是狮王阿斯兰的平面金像。这些她都只来得及匆匆扫了一眼，凯斯宾就把右舷侧的门打开了，对她说：“露西，这是你的房间。我给自己找几件干衣服。”他边说边在一个柜子里翻找，“找完我就出去，好让你换身衣服。你把湿衣服扔在门口就行，我让人拿去厨房烘干。”

露西觉得待在凯斯宾的房间自在得很，好像已经在这里住过几个星期了似的。她不会因为船身的摇晃发愁，因为她以前在纳尼亚当女王的时候可没少出海航行。船舱很小，但是很明亮，挂满了镶板画（画了各种各样的鸟兽、深红色的龙，还有葡萄藤），而且一尘不染。凯斯宾的衣服对露西来说太大了，可她好歹能凑合着穿。他的鞋子、拖鞋和长筒靴都太大，但是她不介意赤着脚在船上走。她穿完衣服后看向窗外湍急的水流，深深地吸了口气，知道要度过一段愉快的时光了。

第二章　黎明踏浪号


“啊，露西，你可来了，”凯斯宾说，“我们正等着你呢。这是船长，德里宁大人。”

一个深色头发的男人单膝跪下，亲吻了她的手。另外在场的人只有雷佩契普和艾德蒙。

“尤斯塔斯在哪里？”露西问。

“他在床上呢，”艾德蒙说，“我觉得我们帮不上他什么忙，你对他好一点儿，只能让他觉得更不舒服。”

“还有，”凯斯宾说，“我们得说说话。”

“天哪，我们真得好好说说话，”艾德蒙说，“先说说时间。按照我们那里的时间来算，自从我们在你加冕礼前离开纳尼亚，已经过去一年了。在纳尼亚过去了多少时间？”

“正好三年。”凯斯宾说。

“一切都好吗？”艾德蒙问。

“你想，要不是一切都好，我还能离开我的王国在这里航海吗？”凯斯宾国王说，“好得不得了。台尔马人、矮人、说话的走兽、半人马还有其他人都不惹事了。我们去年夏天在前线把那些滋事的巨人打得落花流水，现在他们对我们俯首称臣。我不在的时候，有一个厉害的人当摄政王，就是矮人杜鲁普金，你记得他吗？”

“亲爱的杜鲁普金，”露西说，“我当然记得。再没有比他更好的人选了。”

“女王陛下，他忠诚得像獾，又英勇得像……老鼠一样。”德里宁说。他原本想说“像狮子一样”，但是看到雷佩契普的眼睛牢牢地盯着他，就立马改了口。

“这艘船正在往哪儿开？”艾德蒙问。

“嗯……”凯斯宾说，“这说来就话长了。也许你们还记得我小时候，我那个篡权夺位的叔叔米拉兹想要除掉我父亲的七位朋友（他们原本应该会支持我的），把他们派到孤独群岛以外的东部海域，探索那里的未知之境。”

“我记得，”露西说，“他们再也没有回来。”

“是的。在我的加冕礼的当日，经过阿斯兰的允许，我发誓，一旦纳尼亚全境和平，我就亲自向东出海航行一年零一天来寻找我父亲的朋友们。若是知道了他们的死讯，我会尽我所能为他们报仇。他们是雷维廉勋爵、伯恩勋爵、阿尔格兹勋爵、马夫拉蒙勋爵、奥克特西安勋爵、雷斯蒂玛勋爵，还有——哎呀，还有一个我记不住名字了。”

“陛下，是罗普勋爵。”德里宁说。

“对对对，就是罗普勋爵。”凯斯宾说，“这就是我此行的主要目的，但是雷佩契普有着更远大的理想。”所有人都看向了那只老鼠。

“我理想远大，”他说，“虽然我身材矮小。为什么我们不能去东方的世界尽头？我们会在那里发现什么？我希望能找到阿斯兰的国度。伟大的狮王总是从东方来，远渡重洋到我们这里。”

“我觉得，这倒是一个好主意。”艾德蒙充满敬意地说。

“但是你觉得，”露西说，“阿斯兰的国度是那种国家吗——我的意思是说，那种能坐船到达的国家？”

“女王陛下，我也不知道，”雷佩契普说，“但是我还在摇篮里的时候，一位树神对我唱过这样一首诗：

在水天相接的地方，

在海水香甜的地方，

雷佩契普不要彷徨，

大胆追寻你心所想，

那就是世界的东方。

“我不知道那是什么意思，但是我一生都始终铭记着这首诗。”

短暂的沉默后，露西问道：“凯斯宾，我们现在到哪儿了？”

“船长知道得比我清楚。”凯斯宾说。于是德里宁把航海图拿出来铺在桌子上。

“我们在这里，”他指着一个地方说，“也就是我们今天中午所在的位置。我们从凯尔帕拉维尔出发，稍稍偏北顺风航行，第二天就到了加尔马。我们在一个港口待了一周，因为加尔马的公爵为陛下举行了一场盛大的比赛，陛下把许多骑士都打下马来——”

“德里宁，我自己也摔得够惨，现在身上还有瘀青呢。”凯斯宾插嘴道。

“——还把许多骑士都打下马来，”德里宁咧嘴笑着又重复了一遍，“我们以为，如果陛下娶了公爵的女儿，公爵大人会很高兴，但是这件事最后不了了之了。”

“她是斜视眼，脸上还有雀斑。”凯斯宾说。

“哦，可怜的姑娘。”露西说道。

“然后我们从加尔马出发，”德里宁继续说，“接下来的两天，大部分时候海上都是风平浪静的，我们只能划桨。后来终于又起风了，我们在离开加尔马的第四天到达了泰瑞宾西亚。那里的国王警告我们不要登陆，因为泰瑞宾西亚爆发了瘟疫。我们快速绕过了那里的海角，在一个远离城市的小海湾停下来，补给了些水。我们又停歇了三天，直到来了一阵东南风，我们才出发前往七岛。接下来的第三天，我们被一伙海盗追上（看船上的装备是泰瑞宾西亚人），但是看到我们全副武装，那船上的人朝两边射了几箭之后就离开了……”

“我们当时就应该追上他们，登上他们的船，把那些龟孙子全都绞死。”雷佩契普说。

“五天以后，我们看见了缪尔岛，你们知道，这是七岛中最西边的一座岛。我们划过海峡，在黄昏时分到达了布伦岛的红湾港。我们在那儿受到了盛情的宴请，尽情地享用了食物和水。六天前我们离开了红湾港，之后一路疾行，所以我估计，我们差不多后天就能到孤独群岛了。算起来，我们总共已经出海快三十天了，从纳尼亚出发在海上航行了四百多里格[1]。”

“我们到了孤独群岛之后呢？”露西问。

“陛下，没有人知道，”德里宁答道，“除非孤独群岛上的人能告诉我们。”

“当年他们可没法告诉我们。”艾德蒙说。

“看来，”雷佩契普说，“真正的冒险在到了孤独群岛之后才开始呢。”

这时，凯斯宾提议晚饭前带着他们在船上四处参观一下，但是露西良心上过不去，说：“我觉得我真得去看看尤斯塔斯了，你们也知道，晕船很难受的。如果有我的那个药瓶，兴许还能治好他。”

“还真的有，”凯斯宾说，“我都忘了。当时你把它留下了，我想这应该算是王室的宝物，就把它带来了——如果你觉得它值得被浪费在晕船这种事上的话，我就拿来。”

“只要一滴就够了。”露西说。

凯斯宾打开了长凳下面的一个储物柜，拿出了一个美丽的钻石小药瓶，露西清楚地记得这个药瓶。“女王陛下，你把这药瓶收回去吧。”他说。接着他们走出船舱，来到了阳光下。

甲板上桅杆前后靠近船头和船尾的地方有两个又大又长的舱口。两个舱口都敞开着，天气好的时候它们都会被打开，好让阳光和空气进入船舱。凯斯宾带领他们走下楼梯，进入后面的舱口，他们进了舱里才发现，原来这地方左右两边都有划桨用的长凳，光线从桨孔透进来，在舱顶雀跃地舞蹈。当然，凯斯宾的船可不像那种靠奴隶划桨的船一样可怕。只有在没风的天气，或是进出海港时，船桨才用得上，而且每个人都会轮流来划桨（雷佩契普除外，因为他的腿太短了）。船两边的长凳下，空间都空出来给桨手放脚。但是中间那块地方却像个地窖，一直深到船的龙骨，里面塞满了各种各样的东西——一袋袋面粉、一桶桶水和啤酒、一桶桶猪肉、一罐罐蜂蜜、一瓶瓶的酒、苹果、坚果、奶酪、饼干、萝卜、培根。舱顶——也就是甲板下面——挂着火腿和一串串洋葱，还有那些不用值班躺在自己的吊床里休息的哨兵。凯斯宾带他们跨过一条条长凳来到船尾。虽然对他来说是跨，对露西来说就是连跨带跳，对雷佩契普来说就是跳远了。他们就这样来到了一面有门的隔墙。凯斯宾打开门，带他们进入了一间船舱，这间船舱就在甲板舱下方的船尾部分。这间舱室当然算不上好，舱顶很低，墙壁像漏斗似的向内倾斜，所以地面的面积很小。虽然有一扇厚玻璃窗，但是没法打开，因为窗户在水下。就在这时，随着船身的颠簸，窗户一会儿在阳光的照射下透射着金光，一会儿在海水的映衬下氤氲着绿意。

“艾德蒙，你得和我在这儿住了，”凯斯宾说，“我们睡吊床，把床位留给你的亲戚吧。”

“陛下，我请求您——”德里宁说。

“不，不，同船船员，”凯斯宾说，“我们已经商量好了。你和莱斯（莱斯是大副）要开船，要费心劳累很多个晚上，我们却只是在那儿唱歌讲故事，所以你和莱斯得住上面左舷的船舱。艾德蒙国王和我在这下面躺着就够舒服了。这个陌生人怎么样了？”

尤斯塔斯面色发青，满脸愁容，问他们风暴是否有减弱的迹象。但是凯斯宾说：“什么风暴？”德里宁不禁大笑起来。

“小殿下，哪有什么风暴？”他叫起来，“这是再好不过的天气了。”

“他是谁？”尤斯塔斯生气地说，“让他走。他的声音让我的头都快炸了。”

“尤斯塔斯，我给你带了点儿东西，会让你好受些。”露西说。

“哎呀，走开，别烦我。”尤斯塔斯咆哮道。但是他还是从她的药瓶里取了一滴药。虽然他说这东西很恶心（她一打开瓶子，船舱里就弥漫着好闻的味道），但是他吞下去之后脸色明显变好了。而且他一定觉得好一些了，因为他不再为了所谓的风暴和头疼哭号，而是开始要求上岸，还说，一到港口他就要向大英领事馆提请“对他们进行裁决”。雷佩契普问他裁决是怎么回事，怎么提请（他还以为这是什么发起决斗的新方式）。尤斯塔斯只能说：“真新鲜，这都不懂。”最后，他们终于成功地让尤斯塔斯相信，他们已经在尽快地赶往他们知道的最近的陆地了，而且他们没法把他送回剑桥了——就是哈罗德叔叔住的地方——这和把他送到月球上去一样难。接着，他满不情愿地答应换上早已为他准备好的干净衣服，来到了甲板上。

凯斯宾现在带他们在船上四处参观，尽管大部分地方他们都已经看过了。他们来到了船头的船楼，看到一位瞭望员站在镀金龙脖子里面的一个小架子上，从张开的龙口向外注视着。船楼里就是船上的厨房和水手长、木匠、厨师、弓箭手头头的住处。如果你觉得厨房在船头很古怪，而且以为烟囱里冒出的炊烟是往后飘的，那你心里想的一定是一艘顶风行驶的轮船。而帆船却是靠后面来的风推动的，所以什么臭味都尽往前面吹。他们被带到了桅顶的观测台上，一开始，人在上面来回晃动，往下看甲板又远又小，让人觉得十分惊恐。站在那里你会知道，如果你掉下去，不一定会掉到甲板上，说不定还会掉进海里。接着他们被带到了船尾，莱斯正在和另一个人一起值班掌舵，舵后的龙尾扬起，镀满金粉，里面半围着一圈小长凳。这艘船的名字叫“黎明踏浪号”，和我们这里的船比起来，真是小巫见大巫，甚至比不上彼得当至尊王，露西和艾德蒙统治纳尼亚时的那些方帆帆船、快速大帆船、宽身帆船和西班牙大帆船。到了凯斯宾祖先统治时期，几乎所有的航海事业都绝迹了。凯斯宾的叔叔，也就是篡位者米拉兹送七勋爵出航时，只能买了一艘加尔马的船，还专门雇了加尔马的水手来操纵。现在，凯斯宾又开始教纳尼亚人航海。黎明踏浪号是他迄今为止造出的最好的船，她太小了，桅杆前面的一边是船载救生艇，另一边是鸡笼（露西负责喂鸡），这两边和中央舱口之间留给甲板的空隙就没有多少了。但是她是同类船中的美女，水手们她说是一位“小姐”，她的线条优美，颜色纯正，每一处梁柱、缆绳、钉子都精美无比。当然，尤斯塔斯对这些毫无兴趣，只顾着吹嘘那些客轮、汽艇、飞机和潜艇（艾德蒙低声咕哝道：“说得好像他真的懂这些一样。”）。露西和艾德蒙对黎明踏浪号很是满意。他们回到船尾的室舱享用晚餐时，看着夕阳染红了西边的整片天空，感受着船身的晃动，品尝着唇齿间的咸味，想象着东方的未知之境，露西高兴得都快说不出话了。

尤斯塔斯心里的想法最好用他自己的话来说，因为第二天早上他们全取回自己的干衣服后，他拿出了一本小小的黑色笔记本和一支铅笔，开始写日记。他一直随身带着这本笔记本，里面记录着他的分数。尽管他不在乎任何课程本身，他对分数倒是在意得很，甚至还会跑去跟人家说：“我得了这么高的分，你得了几分？”但是在黎明踏浪号上，他似乎不太可能得到多少分数，所以他就开始写日记了。这是他的第一篇日记。

如果这不是梦的话，我已经在这艘可怕的船上待满二十四小时了。骇人的风暴一直很猖獗（还好我没晕船）。巨浪不停地迎面打过来，有无数次我看见船都快沉下去了。其他人对此都装作毫不在意，要么是他们在虚张声势，要么就像哈罗德所说的，普通人做的最懦弱的事之一就是对事实视而不见。他们用这样的破船出海真是疯了。这船比救生艇大不了多少。当然，船内的装潢十分原始。没有像样的酒吧，没有无线电，没有卫生间，也没有躺椅。我昨天晚上被硬拖着走遍了这艘船，凯斯宾卖弄他这艘可笑的玩具小船的样子真叫人厌恶，好像这是“玛丽皇后号”邮轮似的。我试图告诉他真正的船该是什么样，但是他太愚钝了。艾德蒙和露西当然也不会支持我。我觉得像露西这样的小孩子意识不到危险，艾德蒙就是在拍凯斯宾的马屁，跟这里的其他人一样使劲巴结他。他们都叫他国王。我说我是一个共和主义者，但是他竟然问我那是什么意思！他看起来什么都不懂。更别说我还被安排到了这艘船上最差的一个船舱，完全就是个地牢。露西倒是被安排到甲板上单独住一整间，跟这艘船的其他地方比起来，那个房间算是最好的了。凯斯宾说，那是因为她是女孩子。我试着让他明白艾伯塔所说的，这样做完全是在贬低女孩子，但是他太愚钝了。然而，他应该知道，如果我再继续住在那个洞里，我会生病的。艾德蒙说我们不能抱怨，因为凯斯宾自己也跟我们合住，把房间让出来给露西。好像这样一来不是更挤、更糟了似的。差点儿忘了说，这里有一种鼠类的东西，十分放肆无礼。别人要是喜欢，大可以容忍，但是如果他这样对我，我会立马拧断他的尾巴。这里的食物也很可怕。

尤斯塔斯和雷佩契普之间的冲突比预料中来得更早。第二天晚饭前，其他人都围坐在桌前等着（人们在海上时，胃口总是格外好），尤斯塔斯冲进来，紧搓着手大喊大叫：

“那小畜生差点儿要了我的命，我坚持一定要对他严加看管。凯斯宾，我可以起诉你。我可以命令你把它消灭掉。”

这时，雷佩契普来了。他的剑已经拔了出来，胡须直起来，凶神恶煞的样子，但是他仍旧保持着礼貌。

“各位，抱歉，”他说，“特别请女王陛下原谅我。如果我知道他要在这里避难，我就应该再多等段时间让他改正。”

“到底怎么了？”艾德蒙问。

事情是这样的：雷佩契普永远觉得船开得不够快，总爱远远坐在前面龙头旁边的舷墙上。他爱在那里望着东方，用他尖锐的声音温柔地唱着那首树神给他编的歌。他从来不紧紧抓着什么，无论船身怎样倾斜，他都能轻松地保持平衡，可能是他把长尾巴拖在舷墙里侧的甲板上才能坐稳吧。船上的所有人都熟悉了他的这个习惯，而且水手们都喜欢他这个习惯，因为大家值班巡视的时候一个人负责瞭望，另一个能有个人说说话。我也不知道尤斯塔斯究竟为什么溜出来，一路步履维艰、磕磕绊绊地走到船头（他还在晕船呢）。也许他期待能看到陆地，又或许他想在厨房转悠转悠，讨点儿东西吃。不管怎样，他一看见拖在地上的长尾巴——可能是因为太诱人了——他马上就想，要是能抓住那条尾巴，把雷佩契普转个一两圈，然后跑开大笑，该有多开心啊。一开始计划进行得很顺利。这只老鼠不比一只大猫重多少，尤斯塔斯一下就把他从栏杆上拽了下来。他四肢张开、嘴巴张大的样子看起来蠢极了（尤斯塔斯心想）。不幸的是，雷佩契普一生战斗无数，从来不会不知所措，也不会忘记自己的本领。被拽住尾巴在空中打转，要拔出剑来可真不太容易，但是他做到了。还没来得及反应，尤斯塔斯的手就被猛戳了两下，痛得他松开了尾巴。那老鼠立马像球似的在甲板上弹开，站稳了身子面对着他，一支又长又尖、亮晃晃的、像烤肉叉子似的可怕家伙，就在他的肚子边来回挥动。（在纳尼亚，这对于老鼠来说可不算是攻击别人腰带以下部位的犯规行为，因为他最高也只能够到这儿了。）

“住手，”尤斯塔斯气急败坏地说，“走开，放下那把东西，太不安全了。我让你住手。我要告诉凯斯宾，我要封住你的嘴，把你捆起来。”

“胆小鬼！你干吗不拔出你自己的剑！”老鼠吱吱地叫，“拔出剑来和我决斗，否则我就用剑面把你打得青一块紫一块。”

“我没有剑，”尤斯塔斯说，“我爱好和平，我不信仰斗争。”

“你的意思是不是，”雷佩契普抽回自己的剑，严肃地说，“你不打算答应和我决斗？”

“我不知道你是什么意思，”尤斯塔斯护着自己的手说，“如果你开不起玩笑的话，我也懒得为你伤脑筋。”

“那你就受我这一剑吧，”雷佩契普说，“还有这一剑——好让你懂点儿礼貌——知道该怎么样尊重一位骑士——和一只老鼠——以及老鼠的尾巴——”他每说一句，就用剑面打一下尤斯塔斯。他的剑是用矮人炼出来的精炼钢薄片制造的，又像桦条一样灵活有力。尤斯塔斯当然没在学校受过体罚，这是他第一次遭受这样的对待，所以尽管还在晕船，他还是一溜烟逃离了船头，穿过甲板，撞开了船尾的舱门——雷佩契普还在后面紧追不舍。对尤斯塔斯来说，那把剑和雷佩契普的追赶一样让他热得发烫，说不定他心里的那股感觉也是热得发烫哩。

结果他俩之间的问题很快就解决了。因为尤斯塔斯很快就意识到了，所有人都把决斗这件事情认真对待，凯斯宾要主动借给他一把剑，德里宁和艾德蒙在讨论是不是该给他增加点儿限制条件，因为他的个头比雷佩契普大太多了。他悻悻地道了个歉就和露西一起走开了。给手清洗包扎后，他就回到了自己的铺位，小心翼翼地侧身躺下了。

第三章　孤独群岛


“前面有陆地。”船头的瞭望员喊了一声。

露西一直在船尾跟莱斯聊天，听到这声喊就急匆匆地走下楼梯，跑了过来。路上艾德蒙跟上了她，等他们到了船头，发现凯斯宾、德里宁和雷佩契普都已经在那里了。那是一个清冷的早晨，天空颜色暗淡，深蓝色的大海上白色的浪花泛着水沫。右舷船头外的不远处，就是孤独群岛中最近的一座——费利梅斯岛，它就像是大海上的一座小绿山，这座岛后面更远一点儿的地方，就是它的姊妹岛多恩岛的灰色斜坡。

“费利梅斯岛一点儿没变！多恩岛也是！”露西拍着手说，“哦——艾德蒙，上次过后，我跟你有多久没见到这些岛了！”

“我一直无法理解它们为什么是纳尼亚的领土，”凯斯宾说，“是至尊王彼得征服了这里吗？”

“不，不是，”艾德蒙说，“在我们统治纳尼亚之前，这里就属于纳尼亚了——那还是白女巫统治纳尼亚的时候呢。”

（顺便说一下，我也没听说过这些遥远的岛是怎么成为纳尼亚的国土的；如果我知道了的话，要是故事真的有趣，我也许会把它写进别的书里。）

“陛下，我们就在这里靠岸吗？”德里宁问。

“我觉得在费利梅斯岛登陆可能不是个好主意，”艾德蒙说，“在我们那会儿，这里几乎没人居住，现在看起来依然这样。大部分人都住在多恩岛，还有一小部分住在阿芙拉岛——就是第三座岛，你们现在还看不到。人们只在费利梅斯岛上放放羊。”

“看来，我们得绕过这个海角了，”德里宁说，“我们要到多恩岛上岸，那么得划桨了。”

“真遗憾我们不能去费利梅斯岛了，”露西说，“我还想再去那儿走走呢。那座岛很孤独——一种美好的孤独，那里长满了野草和三叶草，海风柔和地吹着。”

“连我都想舒展舒展我的腿了，”凯斯宾说，“我跟你说，我们划小船上岸，再让人把小船划回来，这样我们就能走着穿过费利梅斯岛，让黎明踏浪号在岛的那头接我们，怎么样？”

如果凯斯宾像这次航行之后那样有经验，他就不会提出这样的想法了。但是在当时，这个主意看起来太棒了。

“哎呀，就这么定了。”露西说。

“你来吗？”凯斯宾对已经包扎好手到甲板上来的尤斯塔斯说。

“只要能离开这该死的船，干什么都行。”尤斯塔斯说。

“该死的？”德里宁说，“你是什么意思？”

“在我们那种文明的地方，”尤斯塔斯说，“船都是很大的，你在船上时根本不会感觉到自己在海上。”

“既然如此，我看你还是待在岸上好了。”凯斯宾说，“德里宁，你能让他们把小船放下来吗？”

于是，国王、老鼠、佩文西兄妹和尤斯塔斯一行人都上了小船，划到了费利梅斯岛的沙滩上。小船把他们留在岸上后，又划回了大船，他们都转过身来环顾四周，黎明踏浪号看上去那么小，他们都不禁感到惊讶。

露西当然是光着脚的，她游泳时就把鞋子给踢掉了。但是你要是打算走在软绵绵的草地上，不穿鞋也没什么难的。能再次上岸，闻到土地和野草的香味，真叫人心里高兴，哪怕开头踏在土地上好像还在船里那样天旋地转。如果你在海上，往往有一阵子会有这种感觉。这里比船上暖和多了，他们走过沙地时，沙子擦过露西的趾尖，她觉得舒服极了。云雀也在歌唱。

他们来到了内陆，登上了一个低矮但是陡峭的山坡。在山顶，他们回头看到黎明踏浪号就像一只亮闪闪的虫子，正划着桨缓缓地向西北方向爬行。等到他们越过山脊，船就看不见了。

多恩岛就在眼前了，它与费利梅斯岛隔着一条约一英里宽的海峡，它后面的左边就是阿芙拉岛。他们一眼就能看到多恩岛上白色的小镇——狭港。

“喂！这是什么？”艾德蒙突然问。

在他们往下走的一个绿色的峡谷那儿，有六七个模样粗野的大汉坐在一棵树下，全副武装。

“别告诉他们我们是谁。”凯斯宾说。

“陛下，为什么不能告诉他们？”答应坐在露西肩膀上的雷佩契普说。

“我刚刚才想到，”凯斯宾说，“这里的人很久没有收到过纳尼亚的音信了，也许他们已经不再承认我们的君主地位了。所以，要是被人知道我是纳尼亚的国王，可能不太安全。”

“陛下，我们有剑。”雷佩契普说。

“嗯，我知道我们有剑，”凯斯宾说，“但是如果我们要再次征服这三座岛，我们得带一支大军前来。”

这时，他们已经离那些陌生人很近了，其中一个黑头发的大个子对他们喊：“早上好啊。”

“早上好，”凯斯宾说，“孤独群岛现在还有统治者吗？”

“当然有了，”那个人说，“是冈帕斯总督。总督在狭港。不过你们可以留下来和我们一起喝酒。”

凯斯宾谢过了他，尽管他和其他人都不太喜欢这些新结识的人的长相。他们都坐了下来。但是酒杯还没来得及举到嘴边，这个黑发男人就对他的同伴点了点头，以迅雷不及掩耳之势把他们一行五人给控制住了。他们挣扎了一阵，但是形势不利，完全敌不过对方。不一会儿，他们几人的武器就被缴去了，双手被绑到背后。只有雷佩契普还在抓着他的人手里挣扎，对人一阵猛咬。

“塔克斯，小心那只畜生，”他们的头头说，“别弄伤了他。我觉得他能卖个好价钱。”

“懦夫！胆小鬼！”雷佩契普吱吱大叫，“要是你够胆，就把我松开，把我的剑还回来。”

“哟！”奴隶贩子（这群人就是奴隶贩子）吹了声口哨，“它还会说话呢！我从来没见过。我不吹牛，他起码能卖到两百月牙。”月牙就是他们那里的货币，一月牙大概值三分之一英镑。

“原来你是干这个的，”凯斯宾说，“你是个绑匪，还是个奴隶贩子。我希望你以此为荣。”

“好了好了，”奴隶贩子说，“别再开口教训我了。你要是乖乖的，就能舒服点儿，知道了吗？我做这个不是为了寻开心。我也像其他人一样要谋生活。”

“你要把我们带去哪里？”露西好不容易才开口问。

“去狭港，”奴隶贩子说，“明天有集市。”

“那里有英国领事馆吗？”尤斯塔斯问。

“有什么？”那人问。

还没等尤斯塔斯解释清楚，那奴隶贩子就说：“行了，这样乱七八糟的胡话我听够了。老鼠倒是很有趣，但是这只说得太烦了。伙计们，我们走。”

接着他们四个被绑在了一起，虽然动作算不得粗暴，但是仍旧绑得很结实。他们被押着往岸边走去。雷佩契普被握在手上。他们威胁他说要把他的嘴绑起来，吓得他不敢再咬人，但是他一直喋喋不休。露西很好奇，这只老鼠和奴隶贩子说这些话，他们怎么受得了。但是那奴隶贩子倒是一点儿也不嫌烦，只是在雷佩契普停下来歇一歇的时候说一声“继续说”，偶尔还会加上句“他就像在说戏”。或者，“啊呀，我都忍不住要想，他真的明白自己说的话呀！”又或者是，“这是你们谁教他的吗？”这彻底激怒了雷佩契普，到最后，他把那一大堆想说的话都憋了回去，开始一言不发。

他们来到了多恩岛那侧的岸边，发现了一个小村庄，沙滩上还停着一艘大艇，不远处还有一艘又脏又破的船。

“年轻人，”奴隶贩子说，“你们不要没事找事，我们就不会为难你们了。都上船吧。”

这时，一个有胡子的俊美男子从一个房子里走出来（我觉得是个客栈），说：“哟，普格，又是你常卖的那种货？”

那个叫普格的奴隶贩子毕恭毕敬地鞠了一躬，用谄媚的声音说：“是的，请大人您尽管选。”

“那个男孩子你卖多少钱？”那人指着凯斯宾问。

“哎呀，”普格说，“我就知道大人您眼光好，一挑就挑中个最好的。什么次等货都瞒不过您的眼睛。那个男孩子，我自己也挺中意的，我有点儿喜欢他。我就是个软心肠的人，我就不应该干这个行当。当然啦，对于大人您这样的顾客来说——”

“你这烂人，到底多少钱，”那位大人毫不客气地说，“你觉得我想听你那些肮脏的废话吗？”

“三百月牙，大人，这是给尊敬的大人您的价钱，要是别人的话——”

“我给你一百五十月牙。”

“哦，求求你，”露西插话进来，“不管怎么样，不要把我们分开。你不知道——”但是她立马止住了，因为她看出即使到了这个地步，凯斯宾还是不想暴露身份。

“好了，一百五十，”那位大人说，“至于你，小姐，抱歉我不能把你们都买下来。普格，把我买的那个男孩子放开吧。还有——你手上还有其他人，好好对待他们，不然有你好看。”

“好吧！”普格说，“跟我做同样行当的人里面，还有人比我对自己的货物更好的吗？没有吧？就是因为我对他们像对待自己的孩子一样。”

“听起来像真的一样。”那人冷酷地说。

可怕的时刻终于到了。凯斯宾被松了绑，他的新主人说：“小伙子，往这里走。”露西一下子哭了起来，艾德蒙却一脸茫然。凯斯宾回过头来，说：“打起精神来，我相信到最后一切都会好起来的。再见。”

“好了，小姐，”普格说，“别再哭了，再哭这张脸就毁了，明天还要去集市呢。你乖乖的，没什么好哭的，知道吗？”

接着他们被送到了一艘奴隶船上，被带到了一个又长又黑的地方，一点儿也不干净。那里还关着很多不幸的人。普格是一个海盗，出没在附近岛屿，抓了很多人，刚刚回来。孩子们没碰到一个认识的人，那些被关着的人大部分都是加尔马人和泰瑞宾西亚人。他们都坐在稻草堆里，想着凯斯宾怎么样了，还要让尤斯塔斯停止抱怨，好像人人都有错，只有他自己无辜似的。

凯斯宾这会儿可比他们过得有趣多了。那个买走他的人带他穿过村子里两排房子中间的一条小巷，走到了村子后面的一块空地上，然后转过身来面对着他。

“孩子，你不用怕我，”他说，“我会好好对你的。我是因为你的长相才买下你的，你让我想起了一个人。”

“大人，能告诉我是谁吗？”凯斯宾说。

“你让我想起了我的主人，纳尼亚的凯斯宾国王。”

这让凯斯宾决定孤注一掷。

“大人，”他说，“我就是你的主人。我就是纳尼亚的凯斯宾国王。”

“你说得这么随意，”那人说，“我怎么知道这是不是真的呢？”

“首先是因为我的脸，”凯斯宾说，“其次，我能在六次之内猜中你是谁。你是被我叔叔米拉兹派出海的七位勋爵之一，我此次出来就是为了寻找他们的。他们是阿尔格兹、伯恩、奥克特西安、雷斯蒂玛、马夫拉蒙，还有……还有……我忘了其他的人了。最后，如果大人您能给我一把剑的话，我能在任何人身上通过正当的决斗来证明我就是凯斯宾，老凯斯宾国王的儿子，纳尼亚的合法国王，凯尔帕拉维尔城堡的主人，孤独群岛的君王。”

“天哪，”那人惊呼，“这声音和说话的方式简直和他父亲一个样。我的国王——陛下——”他在这片土地上跪下来亲吻了凯斯宾的手。

“大人您赎我们花的钱会从国库里补偿给您的。”凯斯宾说。

“陛下，那钱还没到普格的口袋里呢，”伯恩勋爵说，他就是伯恩勋爵本人，“而且我相信那钱永远不会是他的。我已经向这里的总督提议过很多次了，让他取缔这里邪恶的人口交易。”

“伯恩勋爵，”凯斯宾说，“我们得谈谈这些岛的状况。但是您能不能先说说自己的故事？”

“陛下，我的故事很短，”伯恩说，“我和其他六位同伴一起来到这里，爱上了岛上的一个女孩，也厌倦了航海。再者，只要您的叔叔还在执政，回到纳尼亚去也没有意义。所以我就结了婚，从那以后就定居在这里了。”

“这个冈帕斯总督怎么样？他还承认纳尼亚的国王是这里的君主吗？”

“他嘴巴上是这么说的，什么事都是以国王的名义进行。可是，要是看到真正的纳尼亚国王活生生地出现在这里，他可不会高兴。要是陛下您手无寸铁地单独去见他——他不会否认他忠诚，但是他会假装不相信你。陛下您的生命就会受到威胁。陛下在附近的海域可有什么追随者？”

“我的船正绕行在这个岛的周围，”凯斯宾说，“如果要打起来的话，我们有三十个人的兵力。要不要把我的船开过来攻打普格，把我的朋友从他那里救出来？”

“我建议您不要这么做，”伯恩说，“一旦打起来，会有两三艘船从狭港开过来援救普格。陛下您必须虚张声势，表现得比真实情况要厉害，还要以国王之名对他们进行威慑。可不能硬碰硬地打。冈帕斯是个胆小鬼，他会被吓住的。”

又一阵讨论之后，凯斯宾和伯恩走到了村子西边不远处的海岸上，凯斯宾在那里吹响了自己的号角。（这不是苏珊女王用的那支纳尼亚魔法号角，凯斯宾把那支魔法号角留给了摄政王杜鲁普金，以备国王不在时有什么急需。）德里宁正在瞭望，等待着信号，立即听出了国王的号角，于是黎明踏浪号开始驶向海岸。救生艇又被派了出来，不一会儿凯斯宾和伯恩勋爵就在甲板上向德里宁解释了目前的情势。德里宁像凯斯宾一样，想把黎明踏浪号开到奴隶船边上，然后登上那艘船。但是伯恩同样不同意他的想法。

“船长，我们沿着这条海峡直下，”伯恩说，“绕到阿芙拉岛，我的宅邸就在那里。但是首先要把国王的旗帜升起来，挂起所有的盾牌，尽可能多地把人派到桅顶的观测台上。等到左舷船头向着公海开出五箭之地后，就发出一些信号。”

“发信号？给谁？”德里宁说。

“哎呀，给那些我们根本没有的船，如果冈帕斯以为我们还有其他的船，那应该对我们有利。”

“哦，我懂了，”德里宁搓着手说，“那他们就会解读我们的信号。我该在信号里说什么呢？就说全体舰队包围阿芙拉岛南部，集合在——”

“伯恩斯丹，”伯恩勋爵说，“好极了。就算有什么船，从狭港也看不到凯斯宾的整个航程。”

想到还在奴隶船上受煎熬的其他人，凯斯宾为他们感到难过，但是他又忍不住觉得那一天余下的时间过得十分愉快。他们转向右舷绕过了多恩岛的东北端，又转向左舷绕过了阿芙拉岛的一端，下午很晚（由于他们全得靠划桨）才进入了阿芙拉岛南部海岸上的一个港口。伯恩的土地在这里向海边倾斜。那是一片幸福又丰饶的封地，那里的人们大多都在田间干活，都是自由人。他们从这里上岸，来到了一处有廊柱的低矮房子里。那房子俯瞰大海，他们就在那里享受了皇家盛宴。伯恩和他亲切的妻子以及快乐的女儿一起款待了他们，大家十分尽兴。天黑以后，伯恩派了一位信使乘小船去多恩岛，为第二天做一些准备（他没具体说是什么准备）。





第四章　凯斯宾之举


第二天早晨，伯恩勋爵一早就来拜访他的客人了。用完早餐，他要求凯斯宾命令每个人都全副武装。“最重要的是，”他又补充说，“每样东西都要整整齐齐，擦得干干净净，就像是，今天早晨尊贵的国王之间要在天下人面前进行大战的第一场战役。”这些都按照要求办妥后，凯斯宾和他的手下以及伯恩和他的几个手下就分作三船，向狭港出发了。国王的旗帜在船尾飘扬，他的号兵都同他在一起。

他们到达狭港的码头时，凯斯宾看见一大群人聚集在一起来迎接他们。“我昨晚捎来口信就是为了这个，”伯恩说，“他们都是我的朋友，都是诚实的人。”凯斯宾一踏上海岸，人群就开始欢呼呐喊：“纳尼亚！纳尼亚！国王万岁！”同时——也是按照伯恩的信使的意思——城里的很多地方都响起了钟声。接着凯斯宾让人举旗开道，吹响小号，每个人都拔出了剑，脸上挂着欣喜又威风凛凛的神情。他们沿着街道向前行进，街面都在震动。他们的盔甲闪闪发亮（那天早上天气晴朗），晃得人不敢直视。

一开始，只有那些被伯恩的信使通知过的人在喝彩欢呼，那些人知道将要发生的事，并且迫不及待地期盼事情的发生。但是接着孩子们都欢呼着加入进来，因为他们喜欢行进的队列，却没怎么见过。然后，上学的孩子们也都欢呼着加入进来，因为他们也喜欢行进的队列，而且他们觉得，越是吵闹和骚乱，他们这个早晨就越有可能不用去上学了。接着，老妇人们都把她们的头探出了门窗，开始唠唠叨叨、欢呼雀跃，因为她们看到了国王，总督跟他比起来算什么？出于同样的原因，那些年轻的女人也都凑了过来，而且她们觉得凯斯宾和德里宁还有其他的人都太英俊了。于是，那些年轻的男人又都加入进来，看看年轻的女人都在看什么。所以，等到凯斯宾到达城堡大门时，几乎整个城里的人都在呐喊。冈帕斯正坐在城堡里，为一堆账目、表格和规章制度焦头烂额，他听到了外面的吵闹声。

凯斯宾的号兵在城堡门口吹响号角，大喊一声：“为纳尼亚的国王打开城门，国王来见他信赖而心爱的臣仆，孤独群岛的总督。”那时候，岛上的什么事都做得马马虎虎、懒懒散散。只有一扇边门被打开了，从里面出来了一个头发乱蓬蓬的人，他头上没戴头盔，而是戴着一顶旧旧的帽子，手里握着一支生锈的旧矛。他惊愕地看着这些身上亮闪闪的人，只是咕哝了一句：“布棱……见……大任。”（他的意思是——“你们不能见大人。”）“没有预约不见，只有每月的第二个星期六的晚上九点到十点之间才能见。”

“你这走狗，在纳尼亚的国王面前还不快脱帽！”伯恩勋爵雷霆大怒，用戴着金属护手的手敲了他一下，把他的帽子都打飞了。

“这是干吗？”那个守门人问，但是没有人理他。凯斯宾的两个手下穿过了边门，摆弄了好一阵门闩才终于打开了大门（因为所有东西都是生锈的）。接着，国王和他的手下大步走进了中庭。总督的几个护卫正在那里闲荡，还有一些人从各个门廊冲了出来（大多数人还擦着嘴）。尽管他们的盔甲丢人现眼，但是如果有人带领他们，或者他们明白了眼前的状况，可能就会掀起一场大战了，所以情势很危急。凯斯宾不给他们任何考虑的时间。

“你们的队长在哪儿？”他问。

“要是你听得懂我的意思，那我就算是这里的队长吧。”有一个年轻人懒洋洋地说。他打扮得很华丽，身上也没穿盔甲。

“我们希望，”凯斯宾说，“如果可能的话，本王这次亲自访问我国领土孤独群岛，对我的臣民来说是一件欢天喜地的事，而不是一件充满恐惧的事。要不是这样，我倒想批评批评你们的盔甲和武器的状况。但实际上，我原谅你们这一点了。去开一桶酒，让大家为我们祝酒。但是明天中午，我希望在这里看到他们拿出士兵的样子来，不要像流浪汉一样。违者一律以触犯王上论罪。”

那个队长瞠目结舌，但是伯恩立即大喊：“为我们的国王欢呼！”那些士兵一头雾水，唯独听懂了要喝酒，就一起欢呼起来。接着，凯斯宾命令他手下的大部分人留在中庭。他和伯恩、德里宁还有另外四个人一起进入了大厅。

孤独群岛的总督远远地坐在桌子一端，身边是他的各种秘书。冈帕斯看起来就是个暴脾气，他的头发以前是红色的，现在多半都变成了灰色。发现有陌生人进来，他抬起头看了一眼，又马上低下头去看文件，不假思索地说：“没有预约不见，只有每月的第二个星期六的晚上九点到十点之间才能接见。”

凯斯宾对伯恩点了点头，就站到了一边。伯恩和德里宁向前一步，一人抓住桌子的一端。他们举起桌子就把它扔向了大厅的一旁，桌子翻倒了，信件、卷宗、墨水瓶、钢笔、封蜡和文件撒了一地。接着，他们的手像钢钳似的牢牢地把冈帕斯从椅子上揪了起来，虽然动作不算粗鲁，但还是一下把他扯到了椅子前四英尺开外的地方。凯斯宾坐在椅子上，把他出鞘的剑放在了膝上。

“大人，”他盯着冈帕斯说，“你可不像我们想象中的那样欢迎我们啊。我是纳尼亚的国王。”

“信里面没提到这件事啊，”总督说，“记录里也没有。我们没收到关于这件事的通知。完全不合规矩。要是你们有什么请求，我倒是很乐意考虑——”

“我们来这里是为了视察阁下您的工作的，”凯斯宾继续说，“有两件事情我特别要求你解释。第一点，根据记录，我发现这些岛屿已经大约有一百五十年没有向纳尼亚的国王进贡了。”

“这件事情我们会在下个月的参议会上提出来讨论，”冈帕斯说，“如果有人提议成立一个调查委员会，在明年的第一次大会上汇报这些岛屿的财政历史，说明当时为什么……”

“我还发现，我国的法律里面写得清清楚楚，”凯斯宾继续说，“如果没有按时进贡，那么这笔账就要算到孤独群岛的总督头上，从总督的私人腰包里掏。”

听到这里，冈帕斯立马上心了。“哎呀，那实在是不可能，”他说，“我付不起这么多钱……呃……陛下您一定是在开玩笑。”

他其实暗自在想，有什么办法能摆脱这些不请自来的客人。如果他知道凯斯宾只有一条船，而且只有这一条船的随从，他一定会当面说些好听话，暗地里则希望在晚上把他们包围起来统统杀掉。但是他昨天看见一条战舰沿着海峡驶来，还看见它打了信号，他心想应该是打给同伙的。那会儿他还不知道这是国王的船，因为风不够大，旗帜没展开，看不见金色的狮像，所以他就等着看事情的发展。现在他想象着凯斯宾在伯恩斯丹有一整支舰队。冈帕斯怎么也不会想到，有人竟然会带着五十人不到的队伍进入狭港，拿下这些岛屿。因为这绝对不是他自己的作风。

“第二点，”凯斯宾说，“我想知道为什么你会允许这种毫无人性的奴隶贸易在这里滋长，这完全与我们的古老传统背道而驰。”

“这是必要的，无法避免，”总督说，“我向您保证，这是这些岛屿经济发展不可或缺的部分，我们现在的繁荣昌盛都是靠它。”

“你们要奴隶有什么用？”

“陛下，出口啊，大部分都卖到了卡罗门。我们还有其他的市场。我们是这种贸易的重要中心。”

“也就是说，”凯斯宾说，“你不需要他们。告诉我，除了把钱赚到普格这种人口袋里，他们还有其他的用处吗？”

“陛下您还年轻，”冈帕斯露出一种父亲般的微笑说，“您理解不了其中包含的经济问题。我有数据，我有图表，我还有——”

“虽然我年轻，”凯斯宾说，“但是我相信我像阁下您一样了解奴隶贸易的本质。我没看见它给这些岛带来了肉、面包、啤酒、葡萄酒、木材、卷心菜、书、乐器、马匹、盔甲或者其他任何值得拥有的东西。不论是不是如此，奴隶贸易必须停止。”

“但是，这就是倒退了，”冈帕斯倒吸了一口凉气，“您不懂进步吗？不懂发展吗？”

“我看到过进步和发展的萌芽状态，”凯斯宾说，“在纳尼亚，我们管这叫‘走歪’，这买卖必须停止。”

“我没法负责实施任何这类措施。”冈帕斯说。

“很好，那么，”凯斯宾说，“我们这就罢了你的职。伯恩勋爵，过来。”冈帕斯还没反应过来，伯恩就已经跪下了，把双手放在国王的双手间，宣誓根据纳尼亚的古老传统、公理、惯例和法律统治孤独群岛。凯斯宾又说：“我想我们不再需要总督了。”于是他封伯恩为公爵——孤独群岛的公爵。

“至于你，我的大人，”他对冈帕斯说，“我原谅你拖欠进贡。但是明天中午之前，你和你的家人必须搬出城堡，这里现在是公爵的住所了。”

“听着，这样也好，”冈帕斯的一位秘书说，“但是如果你们不再演戏，我们就来做点儿小交易。我们面前的问题是——”

“问题是，”公爵说，“你们这群乌合之众想要毫发无伤地离开，还是想挨顿揍再走。你们自己选。”

等到这件事情圆满解决之后，凯斯宾下令备马。马倒是有几匹，虽然喂养得不好，但凯斯宾和伯恩、德里宁，还有其他几个人骑上马就往城里赶，直奔奴隶市场。奴隶市场在一个长长的矮房子里，离港口很近。他们走进去一看，那里就像一个拍卖场。那里有一大群人，普格站在台上，扯着他的粗嗓门大喊：

“先生们，这是二十三号。身体健康的泰瑞宾西亚庄稼人，适合当矿工或者桨手，不到二十五岁，一颗坏牙也没有。好家伙，这肌肉真结实。塔克斯，把他的衣服脱了，好让诸位先生看看。这肌肉！看看他的胸脯。角落里那位先生出十个月牙。先生您一定是在开玩笑。十五！十八！有人为二十三号出价十八个月牙。还有更高的吗？二十一。谢谢您，先生。有人出价二十一——”

然而，普格一看到一群穿着盔甲的人铮铮作响地走上平台，立马就打住了，吓得瞠目结舌。

“所有人，向纳尼亚的国王下跪。”公爵说。所有人都听到了外面叮叮当当的马铃声和马蹄声。许多人听说了他们登陆的传闻和城堡里发生的事。大多数人都服从了命令，那些没下跪的人也被身旁的人拉了下来。还有一些人欢呼起来。

“普格，因为你昨天攻击了王室成员，你得为此偿命，”凯斯宾说，“不过我原谅你的愚昧无知。一刻钟以前，我们国土上的奴隶贸易已经被全部禁止。我宣布，这个市场上的所有奴隶都自由了。”

他举起手，止住了奴隶们的欢呼，然后说：“我的朋友们在哪里？”

“那个可爱的小女孩和漂亮的男孩子吗？”普格谄媚地笑着说，“哎呀，他们一下子就被买走了……”

“凯斯宾，我们在这儿，我们在这儿。”露西和艾德蒙一起大喊。“陛下，谨候差遣。”雷佩契普从另一个角落尖声叫道。他们都已经被买走了，但是他们的买主还留在这里想买其他奴隶，所以他们还没有被带走。人群自动散开，好让他们三个人出来，他们与凯斯宾热烈地握手问候。两个卡罗门的商人立马走上前来。卡罗门人面色黝黑，留着长胡子。他们穿着飘逸的长袍，戴着橙色的头巾。他们是聪明智慧、腰缠万贯、礼貌谦恭又残酷无情的古老民族。他们毕恭毕敬地向凯斯宾鞠了个躬，对他大加赞美，都是些繁荣的源泉灌溉了贤德的花园之类的话，不过他们的意图当然是把付出去的钱再要回来。

“先生们，这样才公平，”凯斯宾说，“今天买了奴隶的人务必把钱拿回去。普格，把你收的钱都拿出来，一小滴都不能剩。”（一小滴等于四十分之一个月牙。）

“好心的陛下，你真的想把我变成穷光蛋吗？”普格哭诉道。

“你这一生都在把自己的幸福建立在别人的痛苦之上，”凯斯宾说，“就算你变成了穷光蛋，那也比做奴隶强。不过，我的另一个朋友在哪里？”

“哦，他呀？”普格说，“欢迎你把他带走。他终于要脱手了，真高兴。我有生之年从来没在市场上看到过这么销不出去的人。最后我给他定价五个月牙，这样都没人要。把他当作买其他奴隶的赠品，还是没有人要。人家碰都不愿意碰他，看都不看他一眼。塔克斯，把那个绷着脸的带出来。”

于是尤斯塔斯就被带了出来，他确实绷着个脸，因为虽然没有人想被当作奴隶卖掉，但被当成没人想买的粗使奴隶也许更让人恼火。他走向凯斯宾，说：“我知道了，又是这样。我们在这儿当俘虏，你倒自个儿快活去了。我想，你还没找到英国领事馆。当然没找到。”

那天晚上，他们在狭港的城堡里举行了盛宴。接着，雷佩契普向大家鞠了一躬，说：“明天我们就要开始真正的冒险了！”说完，他就去睡觉了。但是第二天根本没走成。因为他们将要离开所有的已知的陆地和海域，必须做好万全的准备。黎明踏浪号里的东西被清空了，搁在滚轴上，由八匹马拖着往岸上运，每一寸船身都由最好的造船工匠进行检修。接着，“她”再下水，尽可能多地装了食物和水——也就是二十八天的量。就算是这样，艾德蒙也沮丧地发现，他们最多只能往东航行两个星期就得放弃寻找了。

这期间，凯斯宾又不失时机地把凡是找得到的狭港最老的船长都找来，问他们关于东边陆地的信息，甚至是听来的传闻。他把城堡里的麦芽酒拿出来，一壶壶倒给那些饱经风霜，长着短短的灰白胡须、澄澈蓝眼睛的老人，从他们那里听来了不少夸张的奇谈。但是那些看起来最诚实的人却说不出孤独群岛以东还有什么陆地。还有很多人认为，如果你向东航行得太远了，就会撞进一个茫茫不见陆地的大海，卷进海浪，永远困在世界的尽头的漩涡里——“我猜想，这就是陛下您的朋友掉到海底的地方。”其他人则只有一些不着边际的故事，比如住着无头人的岛屿、漂浮的岛、海上龙卷风、沿着水面燃烧的火焰之类的。只有一个人说了让雷佩契普喜出望外的话：“再过去，就是阿斯兰的国度了。不过那儿比世界的尽头还要远，你们到不了那儿。”但是大家再问他问题的时候，他又说这不过是从他父亲那儿听来的。

伯恩只能告诉他们，他看见他的六位同伴开船往东去了，之后他们就杳无音信了。他与凯斯宾一起站在阿芙拉岛的制高点向东俯瞰大海的时候说了一番话。“我早晨经常来这里，”公爵说，“看着太阳从海面升起，有时候太阳看起来只有几英里远。我也想知道我的朋友们怎么样了，想知道地平线后面到底是什么。最大的可能是什么也没有，但是我总是羞愧于我留在了这里。可是我希望陛下您不要去。我们这里需要您的帮助。关闭奴隶市场可能会创造一个新的世界，我预料我们和卡罗门之间将有一场大战。我的王，请您三思。”

“公爵大人，我发过誓，”凯斯宾说，“再说了，我要怎么跟雷佩契普交代？”





第五章　暴风雨来临


他们登陆三周后，黎明踏浪号才被拖出了狭港的港口。他们进行了庄严的道别，一大群人聚集在一起送行。凯斯宾向孤独群岛的居民做最后的演讲，与公爵和他的家人告别时，引来了欢呼，也触动了泪水。那艘船却不为所动，紫色的帆怡然自得地轻轻摆动，渐渐远离海岸。凯斯宾的号声从船尾隔着海水传来，越来越渺茫，所有人都沉默了。接着，她到了风中，风帆鼓起，拖船也解开缆绳开始往回划。当第一个真正的海浪从黎明踏浪号的船头下涌起，船又变得生气勃勃起来。不值班的人走下甲板，德里宁站在船尾楼开始第一班瞭望。黎明踏浪号掉转船头向东，绕着阿芙拉岛的南部开走了。

接下来的几天过得很愉快。露西觉得自己是世界上最幸运的女孩，因为她每天早上醒来都看到水面阳光的倒影在自己屋子的天花板上跳舞，环顾四周，都是她从孤独群岛得来的好东西——橡胶长靴、中筒靴、披风、皮上衣还有围巾。然后，她会走上甲板，从船头望向海面。每天早晨，海水都是明亮的蓝色，她呼吸的空气也日益温暖起来。接着，她就开始吃早餐，她这样的好胃口只有在海上的人才会有。

很多时候，她都坐在船尾的小凳子上和雷佩契普下棋。看雷佩契普举棋子的样子真是有趣极了。棋子对他来说太大了，他要把棋子走到棋盘中间，就得踮着脚尖用双爪举起棋子。他是一个高手，只要记得自己在下棋，他往往会赢。但是露西时不时地也会赢，因为这只老鼠会做出荒唐的举动，比如把马送到王后和车的两面夹击中去。他这么做是因为忘了这是在下棋，以为这是一场真正的战役，就让骑士做了他自己在这种情况下一定会做的事，因为他脑子里满是敢死队、视死如归、背水一战之类的东西。

但是愉快的日子没过多久。一个夜晚，露西正站在船尾悠闲地看着船身开过海面留下的水沟痕迹。突然，西边天空一大片云急速地堆积起来。接着，云中间豁开了一个口子，黄色的夕阳从里面倾泻而下。他们身后的海浪看起来形状诡异，海面一片淡褐色，一片土黄色，像脏帆布似的。空气变得冷飕飕的。船也开始不安分了，似乎察觉到了身后的危险。船帆一会儿平软无力，一会儿又疯狂地鼓动。露西注意到了这些，正奇怪这风声中传来的凶兆，就听到德里宁大喊：“全员到甲板上集合！”一时间所有人都忙得不可开交。舱口盖钉上扣板封死了，厨房里的火也熄灭了，有人爬到高处去收帆。他们还没来得及做完所有的事，风暴就来袭了。露西看到，他们船头前的海面上劈开了一个巨大的峡谷，他们往下冲了进去，那里面比她想象得还要深。灰色的巨大波浪比桅杆还要高，径直朝他们冲过来，看起来是必死无疑了，不料船却一下被抛上了浪尖。接着船开始打转。水像瀑布似的倾泻到甲板上。船首楼和船尾楼像两座孤岛隔海相望，中间隔着波涛汹涌的海水。桅杆高处的水手们把身子躺在帆桁上，想努力控制住船帆。一根断了的绳索随风从斜里挺出，像根拨火棍一样又直又硬。

“陛下，快下来。”德里宁嚷道。露西知道像自己这样没出过海的人对于船员们来说是个麻烦，于是准备听他的话下来。但是，这做起来有点儿难。黎明踏浪号向右舷偏得厉害，甲板也倾斜得像一个屋顶。她只能四处爬，爬到梯子的顶部，一把抓住栏杆。这时有两个人爬上梯子，她就站在一边，然后尽快地爬下了楼梯。又一个浪穿过甲板打到梯子底部，直接没过了她的肩膀，幸亏她抓得紧才没被冲倒。虽然她浑身都已经被水沫和雨水淋得湿漉漉的，但是这个浪更冷。接着她就奔向舱门冲了进去，把飞快涌进黑暗里的风浪那吓人的景象暂时关在了门外，却挡不住外面可怕又混乱的咯吱声、哼哼声、噼啪声、咔嗒声、呼啸声、轰隆声，这些声音比在船尾楼上听着更加让人惊恐不安。

接下来的日子，就这样日复一日地闹下去，直到人们都记不清它们是从哪一天开始的。舵柄上一直值守着三个人，三个人需要尽全力才能掌控好船的航向。抽水机也需要人看守。所有人都没法休息。厨房没法开火，东西也没法弄干，还有一个人掉下了船，再也找不到了，太阳也从未露面。

当这一切都结束时，尤斯塔斯在日记里写上了下面的文字：

九月三日

过了这么久，今天终于可以写日记了。我们在飓风中度过了十三个日日夜夜。虽然其他人都说只有十二天，但是我知道是十三天，因为我一直在仔细地数数。和一群数数都数不对的人一起冒着危险航行真是开心啊！这段时间真是太可怕了，一个个巨浪不停地打过来，我们全身都湿透了，也吃不到一餐正经的饭，更不用说给别人发信号求救了，因为这里连无线电甚至火箭都没有。这些都证明了我之前一直跟他们说的，用这样一个又小又烂的“浴缸”出海真是疯了。就算是和像样的正经人出来也够糟的了，更何况我现在正和披着人皮的魔鬼在一起。凯斯宾和艾德蒙对我太残忍了。我们的桅杆折断那晚（现在那里只剩下一根树桩了），我很不舒服，他们还逼我上甲板去像个奴隶似的工作。露西还多管闲事，说雷佩契普很想去，只是他太小了。我猜想她是没看到，那个小畜生做的一切都只是为了炫耀。就算她年纪还小，这点儿判断力她也应该有。今天，这艘该死的船终于平稳下来了，太阳也出来了，我们一直在唠叨该做点儿什么。我们的食物还够吃十六天，虽然大部分都很难吃。（家禽都被冲到海里去了，就算它们没被冲下去，这风暴也会让它们不再下蛋。）真正的麻烦是水。有两个桶好像被撞出了裂缝，里面的水已经漏完了。（这就是纳尼亚人的效率。）因为水的供给不足，我们每天只喝半品脱的水，也只够十二天的量。（船上还有很多朗姆酒和葡萄酒，但是他们也知道，喝了这些只会更渴。）

如果可以的话，最明智的做法当然是立即掉头往西去孤独群岛。但是我们到这里花了十八天，狂风吹着船疯了似的往前开。就算我们遇上了东风，开回去也要花更长的时间。再说了，现在一点儿刮东风的迹象都没有——实际上根本没有风。如果划船回去，那会花上很长的时间，而且凯斯宾说大家不能靠着每天半品脱的水划桨。我很确定，这句话是错的。我试图解释流汗会让人觉得凉爽，所以划桨的水手不需要那么多水。但是他根本不在乎我说的话，他想不出该怎么回话的时候经常这样。其他人都投票赞成继续往前开，希望能找到陆地。我觉得我有责任指出，我们不知道前方有没有陆地，我努力让他们知道这样一厢情愿是很危险的。他们没有去想一个更好的办法，反而还有脸来问我有什么提议。所以我只是冷静沉着地告诉他们，我被绑架到这里，还未经我的同意就被硬拖着加入了这愚蠢的航行，帮他们走出困境可不是我的事。





九月四日

还是风平浪静。晚餐的口粮只有一点点儿，而且我分到的最少。凯斯宾分食物的时候总是耍点儿滑头，以为我看不出来！露西不知怎的想分给我一点儿她自己的食物，来补偿一下我，但是艾德蒙又自以为是地来多管闲事，不让她分给我。太阳很毒辣，整个晚上都渴得不行。





九月五日

还是风平浪静，而且还很热。整天都觉得身体虚弱，我肯定发烧了。当然，他们不会有在船上备一个体温计的意识。





九月六日

可怕的一天。我晚上醒来，知道自己发烧了，必须得喝点儿水。任何医生都会这么说。天知道，我是绝对不会设法得到什么不公平的好处的，但是我做梦也没想到，船上配给水的方式竟然还适用于一个病人。事实上，如果不是我觉得把其他人叫醒太自私的话，我就会把他们叫起来，问他们要点儿水。所以我就自己起来，拿上我的杯子，踮着脚走出了我们睡觉的黑洞。为了不吵到凯斯宾和艾德蒙，我小心翼翼的，因为自从天热缺水以来，他们就没睡过好觉。不管别人对我好不好，我总是在考虑别人的感受。我顺利地进了大房间，要是这也叫一个房间的话。这里面放着划桨的长凳和行李。房间的一端放着水。一切都进行得很顺利。但是我还没来得及舀满一杯水，那个小特务雷佩就抓住了我。我试图解释，说我是到甲板上来透透气的（水的事情跟他又没有关系），但是他问我为什么拿着杯子。他声音太大了，整条船上的人都被吵醒了。他们对我真的很过分。我问他们，为什么雷佩契普半夜三更在水桶旁边鬼鬼祟祟，任何一个人都会这样问。他就说，他个子太小了，在甲板上派不上什么用场。他每天晚上来看水，就能多一个人去睡觉。他们这一套不公平的做法又来了：他们都相信他说的话，你又能怎样呢？

我必须得道歉，否则这个危险的小畜生就要拿他的剑指着我了。接着凯斯宾就露出了他的真面目——一个残忍的暴君，大声地告诉所有人，以后任何被抓住“偷”水的人都要“受两打”。我不知道这是什么意思，后来艾德蒙解释给我听，我才知道这是从佩文西家的孩子们看的书里来的。

凯斯宾这么装模作样地恐吓之后，又改变了语气，对我俨然一副恩赐的态度，说他对我爱莫能助，因为所有人都像我一样觉得发烧了，但是我们都要努力挺过去，等等之类的话。自以为是的讨厌鬼。我今天一整天都待在床上。





九月七日

今天有一点儿风了，但还是西风。靠着一部分帆往东行驶了几英里，他们把帆装在德里宁所谓的应急桅杆上，也就是把船首斜桅竖直了绑（他们叫“捆”）在桅杆断掉的桩子上。仍旧渴得要命。





九月八日

还在往东航行。我现在整天都赖在我的床铺上，在那两个恶魔回来睡觉之前，我除了露西一个人也看不到。露西把她的水分给了我一点儿。她说女孩子不像男孩子那么容易感到口渴。我经常这么想，但是这一点应该让海上更多的人知道。





九月九日

看到了陆地，那是东南方向远处的一座高山。





九月十日

那座山越来越大，越来越清晰，但还是很远。不知有多久没看见海鸥了，今天第一次看到。





九月十一日

抓到了一些鱼，他们把它们当晚餐吃了。晚上七点左右，在这个山岛一个海湾水深三英寻[1]的地方抛了锚。那个白痴凯斯宾不让我们上岸，因为天快黑了，他害怕野人和野兽。今晚配给了额外的水。

在这个岛上将要发生的事情会大大地关系到尤斯塔斯，比和其他任何人的关系都要大。但是这没法用他自己的话说出来，因为在九月十一日之后，他有很长时间都忘了写日记了。

早晨，天空昏暗低沉，但是天气很热，这群冒险者发现自己身处的海湾被悬崖峭壁所包围，就像是挪威峡湾一样。在他们面前，海湾滩头上有一些平地，上面长满了树木，看上去像是香柏，从树林中穿出来一条激流。再远一点儿有一块险峻的峭壁，顶上是参差不齐的山脊，山脊后面是朦胧的群山，被灰压压的云遮住了，看不见山顶。近处海湾两边的峭壁被一条条的白练切割开来。大家都知道那是瀑布，虽然距离比较远，看不出来水流的运动，也听不到水声。整个地方都非常寂静，海湾的水面平静得像镜子一样，映出了峭壁上的每一处细节。这样的场景从图片里看起来非常漂亮，要是身临其境就显得有些压抑了。这个地方并不欢迎外来的访客。

整条船上的人乘上两艘小船上了岸，每个人都畅快地在河里喝水、洗澡。他们吃了饭，休息了一会儿之后，凯斯宾派回去四个人看船，一天的工作就这么开始了。要做的事情很多。水桶要搬到岸上来，坏掉的桶能修的要修一修，然后再装满水；要是有树——最好是松树——就得伐倒用来做一根新桅杆。船帆要修好。还要组织一支狩猎队，岛上出产什么野物就打什么野物。衣物要洗干净修补好。还有船上数不清的破损处要修。他们几乎快要认不出这就是离开狭港时那艘华丽雄伟的黎明踏浪号了——现在远远地看起来才更像。她看起来就像一艘破旧不堪、褪了色的废船，任何人都会把她当作一堆沉船的残骸。船员们也不见得有多好——他们苍白瘦削，因为缺少睡眠而眼睛发红，还穿得破破烂烂的。

尤斯塔斯躺在一棵树下，听见了所有这些计划，他的心不由得沉了下去。难道不休息了吗？他们期盼已久终于到达了陆地，似乎第一天就准备跟在海上时一样干活。于是他想到了一个绝妙的点子。没人看着他，大家都在讨论他们的船，好像他们真的喜欢这破东西似的。他干吗不悄悄溜走呢？他可以在内陆溜达溜达，在山上找一个凉快通风的地方美美地睡上一觉，直到其他人结束一天的劳动再去找他们。他以为这对他有好处。不过他要十分小心，得一直看得见海湾和船，保证自己能找到回去的路。他才不愿意流落在这个地方呢。

他立马就开始实施自己的计划。他悄悄地从所在的地方站起来，从树林里溜走。他小心翼翼地走得很慢，还装出漫无目的的样子，以便让看见他的人以为他只是在散步而已。他很惊讶地发现自己身后的对话声很快就听不见了，树林变得很沉寂、温暖，一片深绿色。很快，他觉得自己可以鼓起勇气，快速坚决地大步往前走了。

没过多久他就走出了树林。他眼前的地面变成了陡坡。草又干又滑，但是他手脚并用还能应付得来。虽然他气喘吁吁，不停地擦汗，但还是坚持不懈地稳步往上爬。顺便提一句，这就说明了他的新生活还是给他带来了一些好处的，虽然他自己不这么觉得。以前的尤斯塔斯，哈罗德和艾伯塔的儿子，爬上十分钟就会放弃了。

慢慢地，中途休息了几次后，他爬上了山脊。他原本以为在这里能看到岛屿中心，但是云层已经变得很低很近，一片雾海迎面滚滚而来。他坐下来回头看。他站在那么高的地方，脚下的海湾看上去很小，几英里的海面尽收眼底。群山间的雾气将他包围，浓厚却不湿冷。他躺下来，翻来翻去，找了个最舒服的姿势开始享受。

但是他并没有享受到，或者说没有享受多久。他人生中第一次开始感到孤单。一开始这种感觉很细微。然后他就开始担心是不是错过了时间。周围一点儿声音也没有。突然，他意识到自己可能已经躺了几个小时了。其他人可能已经走了！也许他们是故意让他一个人走散好把他一个人留在这里！他惊慌地一下子蹿起来，往山下奔去。

一开始他想走快点儿，不料滑倒在了陡峭的草坡上，溜了几英尺远。他觉得可能这一下让他往左偏了太多——他爬上来的时候能看见那边的悬崖。于是他又往上攀爬，尽可能靠近他猜想的出发点。接着，他重新往下走，靠着右边。接下来，情况似乎明朗起来。他小心翼翼地走着，因为他只能看见前面一码远的地方，而且周围仍旧是鸦雀无声。他内心一直有个声音在说：“快点，快点，快点。”但是他只能谨慎地慢慢走，这让他十分不悦，因为他越来越相信自己是被丢下了。如果他了解凯斯宾和佩文西家的孩子，就会知道，他们绝不可能做出这样的事情来。但是他已经说服了自己，认为他们都是披着人皮的魔鬼。

“终于到了！”尤斯塔斯滑下一个满是细碎石子的斜坡（他们管这叫碎石坡），发现自己已经到了平地上。“那么，那些树在哪里？前面有一片黑的东西。哎，我觉得雾在散去。”

确实如此。光线越来越强，闪得他眨眼睛。雾散了。他在一个完全不认识的峡谷里，海也看不见了。

第六章　尤斯塔斯的历险


那会儿，其他人都在河里洗脸洗手，基本上都在为晚餐和休息做准备。三个最好的弓箭手都钻进了海湾北面的山坡，带着两只野山羊满载而归，羊肉正在火上烤着。凯斯宾命人搬了一桶阿钦兰的烈酒上岸。喝那酒得兑点儿水，所以这一桶就够所有人喝了。目前为止，这项工作很顺利，这顿饭也吃得很愉快。吃完第二份羊肉之后，艾德蒙才说：“尤斯塔斯那讨厌鬼在哪里？”

这时，尤斯塔斯环顾这不知名的峡谷。这峡谷又窄又深，被悬崖峭壁所包围，就像是一个巨大的深沟或者战壕。地上铺满了石头，绿草却还是繁密茂盛。尤斯塔斯看见到处都是焦黑的斑块，跟干燥的夏日里铁路路堤两边的斑块一样。离他大约十五码的地方，有一个清透澄澈、水面光滑的池塘。一开始，峡谷里什么也没有，不见动物的踪影，没有鸟，连只虫子都见不着。阳光直射下来，狰狞的峰峦俯瞰着峡谷边缘。

尤斯塔斯当然意识到了，在浓雾里，自己从山脊下来的时候走错了路，爬到山脊的另一边去了。于是他立马回头，想着要走回去。但是他回头一看，立马吓得一阵哆嗦。显然，他运气极好，才能找到唯一的一条下来的路——一条长长的绿色小道，又陡又窄，两边耸立着悬崖峭壁。没有其他回去的路。他现在已经看到这条路有多难走了，他还回得去吗？光是想到这儿就让他头晕目眩。

他再次转过身，想着不管怎样还是先好好喝点儿这池塘里的水吧。但是就在他转身的一刹那，还没来得及往峡谷里迈出一步，他就听到了身后有声响。那声音很小，但是因为周围太过安静，听上去很响。他吓得一动不动，在原地僵了一会儿后，才扭过脖子往后看去。

在崖底，他左手不远的地方有一个又低又黑的洞穴——可能是通往某个山洞的入口。两缕细烟从洞里冒出来。黑洞底下松散的石头在移动（那就是他听到的声音），好像有什么东西在它们后面的黑暗里爬行。

确实有什么东西在爬。更糟的是，那东西要出来了。艾德蒙或是露西肯定一眼就能认出这东西，你也认得出，但是尤斯塔斯从没看过对的书。有一个东西从山洞里出来了，尤斯塔斯想都没想到过这样的东西——铅灰色的长鼻子，暗红色的眼睛，没有羽毛也没有毛皮，又长又软的身体拖在地上，像蜘蛛一样的腿，弯起来抬得比背还高，凶残的爪子，像蝙蝠一样的翅膀在石头上发出刺耳的噪音，它的尾巴拖得老长，两个鼻孔里冒出缕缕烟气。他从没对自己说过“龙”这个词。就算他说过，眼前这景象也让他没法接受。

但是，如果他对龙略知一二，也许就会对这条龙的行为感到一点儿奇怪。它没有坐起来拍打它的双翼，也没有从嘴里喷出火焰。鼻孔里冒出来的烟就像是快要熄灭的火冒出来的烟。它看上去没有注意到尤斯塔斯，径自缓慢地向水塘爬去，还歇了很多次。尤斯塔斯尽管害怕，但还是不免觉得它是只又老又悲哀的生物。他不知道自己敢不敢往山上冲，但是如果他弄出声响，它可能会回过头来看，还可能会活下来。也许它当下只是在装装样子呢。不管怎么说，拼命爬上山，企图逃离一只会飞的怪物，这又有什么用呢？

它到了水塘边，把自己可怕的布满鳞片的下巴滑到了沙砾上准备喝水。但是它还没来得及喝水，就发出了呱呱的叫声，也像响亮的哭号。一阵抽搐后，它翻了个身，便一动不动，一只爪子还悬在半空。它的嘴巴大张着，从里面流出了暗红色的血液。从它鼻孔中冒出的烟一时间化为了黑色，随风飘走了。接着它就再也没有动静了。

尤斯塔斯好长时间不敢动弹。这也许是那畜生的诡计，为了引诱旅行者们走向灭亡。但是也不能一直在那等着。于是尤斯塔斯往前走了一步，又走了两步，然后又停下来了。龙还是一动不动，他还注意到它眼睛里红色的火焰也已经消失了。最后尤斯塔斯终于走到了它跟前。他现在肯定它已经死了。他战栗着摸了它一下，什么事都没发生。

尤斯塔斯悬着的心终于可以放下来了，他差点儿笑出声来。他得意地觉得好像是自己和那条龙一番打斗后亲手杀了它，而不是仅仅在一旁看着它死去。他跨过了龙的尸体，走向池塘边开始喝水，因为他快受不了那灼热的天气了。他听到了一声雷响，但是并不觉得奇怪。雷声过后，太阳立马消失了，他还没喝完水，豆大的雨滴就砸了下来。

这个岛上的气候真的是太恼人了。不一会儿，尤斯塔斯就浑身湿透了，眼睛什么也看不清了，欧洲可从没下过这样的雨。这雨要是不停，就没法爬出山谷。他看到了唯一一处有遮蔽的地方，朝那里狂奔过去，那就是龙穴。他在那里就地躺下，使劲地喘着气。

我们大多数人都知道龙的巢穴里会有什么，但是，我之前也说过，尤斯塔斯只看那些错的书。那些书大多是关于进出口、政府、资金外流这些事的，不怎么写龙。就是因为如此，他对自己躺着的地面感觉怪怪的，但是又摸不着头脑。有些地方不像石头，因为有很多刺；也不像荆棘，因为太硬了。那上面好像还有很多又圆又扁的东西，他一动就开始叮当作响。借着洞口的光，他看得清清楚楚。当然，我们都能提前说出来那些东西是什么。尤斯塔斯也发现了，那些都是财宝，有皇冠（就是那些有刺的东西）、硬币、戒指、手镯、金锭、杯子、餐盘和宝石。

尤斯塔斯（不像大多数男孩那样）从来没看重过财宝，但是他立马就明白了，在这个他通过露西卧室里的画误打误撞进入的新世界中，这些东西能派上什么用场。“他们这儿不用交税，”他说，“也不用把财宝缴纳给政府。要是有些这东西，我就能在这儿过上逍遥日子啦——也许我可以去卡罗门。它听起来是这些国家里面最靠谱的了。不知道我能带上多少？那个手镯——里面的那些东西大概是钻石——我要戴在自己的手腕上。太大了，不过我可以一直把它推到手肘以上，这样就不显大了。然后把我的口袋装满钻石——那比装金子容易多了。不知道这该死的雨什么时候停下来。”他在那堆财宝中找了一处比较舒服一点儿的地方安心等待，那里大多是硬币。但是巨大的惊吓之后，尤其是走了一段山路后再受一场大惊，会让人觉得非常疲惫。尤斯塔斯就这么睡着了。

尤斯塔斯睡得正香，打着呼噜，而其他人正吃完了晚餐，开始为他担心。他们大喊：“尤斯塔斯！尤斯塔斯！喂——”他们嗓子都喊哑了，凯斯宾吹响了号角。

“他不在附近，不然他早就听到了。”露西急得脸色惨白。

“这讨厌鬼，”艾德蒙说，“他这样溜走，到底要干什么？”

“但是我们必须得想办法，”露西说，“他可能走丢了，或者掉进了洞里，也可能被野人抓走了。”

“还可能死在野兽口中了。”德里宁说。

“啊呀，要是真死了就好了。”莱斯咕哝道。

“莱斯大人，”雷佩契普说，“你从没说过一句有失身份的话。那人虽然不是我的朋友，但是他是女王陛下的亲人。而且他是我们的一员，我们得找到他，如果他死了我们还要替他报仇，这关乎我们的荣誉。”

“我们当然得找到他（如果我们找得到的话），”凯斯宾疲倦地说，“这就是让人讨厌的地方。这意味着我们要组织一个搜索队，还有无穷无尽的麻烦。尤斯塔斯这个烦人精。”

这时，尤斯塔斯还在呼呼大睡。手臂上的一阵刺痛惊醒了他。月光从洞口照进来，财宝堆成的床看起来变得更加舒服了：实际上他几乎感觉不到它的存在。一开始，他对自己手臂上的疼痛感到莫名其妙。不一会儿，他突然觉得胳膊肘上方的镯子变得异常的紧。他睡着的时候手臂一定是肿起来了（那是他的左手臂）。

他移动自己的右臂，想去摸一摸自己的左臂，但是还没挪动一英尺，他就停了下来，惊恐地咬紧了嘴唇。因为他看到，在他面前靠右一点儿的地方，月光把洞里照得清清楚楚，有一个形状可怕的东西在移动。他认得出那个形状：那是一只龙爪。他挪动自己手臂的时候，那东西也在动；他一停下，那东西也停了下来。

“哎呀，我真是犯蠢，”尤斯塔斯心想，“那畜生当然会有同伴了，它就躺在我边上。”

好一会儿，他丝毫不敢动。他看到眼前升起了两缕细烟，在月光下是黑色的，就像另一条龙死前鼻孔里冒出来的烟。他惊恐得屏住了呼吸。那两缕烟消失了。过了一会儿，他屏不住了，就偷偷地把气呼出来，那两缕烟立马又出现了。但是，直到现在尤斯塔斯还没发现真相。

不一会儿，他就决定要小心地往左边缓缓移动，想办法偷偷溜出这个山洞。也许那条龙已经睡着了——不管怎么样，这是他唯一一次逃走的机会。当然，他向左边逃走之前往左边看了一眼。哎呀，太可怕了！那边也有一只龙爪。

假如这时有谁看见尤斯塔斯流眼泪，决不会怪他。当他看到自己的眼泪溅落在面前的财宝上有这么大的时候，非常吃惊。他的眼泪好像还很烫，冒着热气。

但是哭也没用。他必须想办法从这两条龙中间爬出去。他伸出自己的右臂。龙的前肢和右爪也做出了同样的动作。接着他想，试试看左臂会怎么样。结果那边的龙的前肢也动了一下。

这两条龙，一边一条，不管他做什么都跟着学！他吓丢了魂，干脆赶快逃走。

他冲出山洞，旁边的财宝丁零当啷，哗啦哗啦地响，金子相互碰撞，石头相互摩擦，他以为那两条龙都追着他，不敢往后看。他跑向水塘。那条死去的龙形态扭曲，躺在月光下显得格外瘆人，但是他几乎没注意到。他想躲进水里。

但是，当他到达水塘边缘时，发生了两件事情。首先，他猛然醒悟到自己刚刚一直在用四肢奔跑，这就像一个晴天霹雳——他到底为什么会这样？还有，当他俯向水面时，另一条龙正从水塘里盯着他。他想了片刻，立马意识到了真相。水里的龙是他自己的倒影。这已经是毋庸置疑的事实了。他动它也动，他张嘴闭嘴它也一样张嘴闭嘴。

他睡着的时候竟变成了一条龙。他贪婪地睡在龙的财宝上，心中满是龙一般的残暴想法，他变成了一条龙。

那一切事情就都说得通了。洞里他的身旁没有两条龙。左右两边的龙爪是他自己的左右爪。那两缕细烟是从他自己的鼻孔里冒出来的。至于他左手臂上（那曾经是他的左手臂）的疼痛，他现在眯着左眼能看清到底是怎么回事了。那个手镯套在男孩子的上臂正合适，对于龙粗壮的前肢来说就太小了。它深深地勒进了他带鳞的肉里，弄得两边的肉都肿胀了起来，阵阵颤动。他用自己的龙牙撕扯那里，但是弄不下来。

虽然很疼，但是他最先感到的是一阵轻松。这下没什么可怕的了。他自己就是最可怕的东西，这世界上除了骑士（而且不是所有的骑士）没人敢攻击他了。他可以报复凯斯宾和艾德蒙了。

但是他想到这里就意识到自己根本不想这么做。他想跟他们做朋友。他想回到人类中间去，和他们一起说说笑笑，分享一切。他意识到自己是一个脱离了人类的怪物。他感受到了一阵可怕的孤独。他开始明白，其他人根本不是魔鬼。他开始怀疑自己是不是自己想象当中的好人。他渴望听到他们的声音。要是现在能听到一句好话，即便是雷佩契普说出来的，他也会感激涕零。

想到这里，这条以前是尤斯塔斯的可怜的龙就放声哭泣起来。一条威武的龙，在月色下的荒芜峡谷中号啕大哭，这场景和声音真是难以想象。

最后，他决定想办法找到回到岸边的路。他现在意识到，凯斯宾不可能已经开船丢下他了。他确信，自己总有办法让人知道他是谁。

他喝了一大口水，然后（我知道这听起来很吓人，但是你仔细想想就不吓人了）他把那条死龙吃得几乎一点儿不剩。他吃了一半才意识到自己正在做什么。因为，你想啊，尽管他的想法是尤斯塔斯的想法，他的口味和肠胃却是龙的。而龙最喜欢吃的就是新鲜的龙肉了。所以你在同一个地方几乎同时找不到两条龙。

接着，他转身爬出山谷。他开始爬时身子一跳。但是他一起跳，就发现自己飞了起来。他几乎忘了自己的双翼，这对他来说是个意外的惊喜——他很久没有收获惊喜了。他飞上高空，看到无数的山峰在月光中铺展在他下面。他看见海湾就像是一块银色的平板，黎明踏浪号停泊在那里，海滩边的树林里闪烁着篝火。他从高空一个滑翔，向着他们俯冲下去。

露西睡得正香，她原本在熬夜，等待搜索队的归来，希望能听到关于尤斯塔斯的好消息。搜索队由凯斯宾带领，回来得很晚，大家个个疲惫不堪。他们带回来的消息也让人担心。他们没找到尤斯塔斯的踪迹，但是在一个山谷里看到了一条死龙。他们努力往好的方面想，每个人都向其他人保证，这附近不太可能有其他的龙了，那条龙是在下午三点左右死掉的（他们在那会儿看到了它），不可能在几个小时前吃人。

“除非他吃了那个小鬼，结果就死了，那小鬼可以毒死任何东西。”莱斯说。但是他说得很小声，没有人听见。

可是，露西在深夜被人轻声叫醒，发现全员都紧凑在一起窃窃私语。

“怎么了？”露西说。

“我们必须要坚定，”凯斯宾说，“一条龙刚刚飞过树梢，停落在海滩上。恐怕它就在我们和船之间。用箭对龙来说完全没用。而且龙也根本不怕火。”

“要是陛下您允许的话……”雷佩契普开口说道。

“不，雷佩契普，”国王坚决地说，“你不能和它单打独斗。除非你保证这件事听我的，否则我就让人把你绑起来。我们只要盯紧点儿，天一亮，我们就去海滩和它打一仗。到时候我带头，艾德蒙国王在我右边，德里宁大人在我左边。没有其他要安排的了。再过几个小时天就亮了。这一个小时之内，我们好好吃一顿，把剩下的酒也喝了。不过我们不能发出声音。”

“也许它会走开的。”露西说。

“那就更糟了，”艾德蒙说，“这样我们就不知道它在哪里了。如果房间里有只黄蜂，我都要看得见它才放心。”

那天晚上余下的时间他们过得糟透了。上饭时，尽管他们知道得吃点儿东西，但是却发现没什么胃口。好像过了很久很久，天渐渐亮起来，鸟儿到处叽叽喳喳，周围的世界比夜晚时来得更加湿冷。凯斯宾说：“朋友们，我们动手吧。”

他们都站起来，拔出自己的剑，紧紧围在一起，把露西围在中间，雷佩契普则站在露西肩上。这样比干等着好多了，而且每个人都觉得其他人比平时更亲近可爱了。不一会儿他们就开始前进了。他们来到树林边，这时天色也已经亮了不少。那条龙就躺在那里的沙滩上，它身形巨大，样貌可怕，周身隆起，像一条巨大的蜥蜴，又像一条灵活的鳄鱼，还像一条长脚的蛇。

可是，那条龙看到他们的时候，并没有起身喷出火和烟，而是往后退了几步——几乎可以说是摇摇晃晃——退到了海湾的浅滩上。

“它干吗这样摇头？”艾德蒙说。

“它现在在点头。”凯斯宾说。

“它的眼睛里有什么东西流出来了。”德里宁说。

“哎呀，你们看不出来吗，”露西说，“它在哭。那些流出来的东西是它的眼泪。”

“我可不会相信，陛下，”德里宁说，“鳄鱼就是这样让你放下戒备的。”

“你说这话的时候它在摇头，”艾德蒙注意到，“它好像在说‘不’。看，它又摇头了。”

“你觉得它听得懂我们说话吗？”露西问道。

那条龙猛地点了点头。

雷佩契普从露西肩上溜下来，走上前去。

“嘿，龙，”他尖声说道，“你听得懂话吗？”

龙点了点头。

“你会说话吗？”

那龙摇了摇头。

“那么，”雷佩契普说，“询问关于你的事也没什么用。但是如果你发誓做我们的朋友的话，就把你的左前腿举过头顶。”

龙照做了，但是它的动作很笨拙，因为那个金镯子把它的腿箍得又痛又肿。

“哎呀，看哪，”露西说道，“它的腿受伤了。可怜的家伙——它可能就是因为这个在哭呢。也许它想让我们帮它疗伤，就像安德鲁克斯与狮子的故事一样。”

“露西，小心点儿，”凯斯宾说，“这条龙很聪明，但是它也有可能是个骗子。”

但是露西已经跑上前去了，雷佩契普立马紧紧跟上，用他的小短腿奋力地跑着。接着，两个男孩子和德里宁当然也跟了上去。

“给我看看你可怜的爪子，”露西说，“也许我能治好它。”

尤斯塔斯变成的龙马上欣然伸出了自己正在痛的腿，它还记得自己变成龙之前，露西用甜香酒治好了他晕船的毛病。但是这次他失望了。那神奇的药只是稍稍减轻了肿胀和疼痛，却没法熔解金子。

大家都围在旁边看着露西为它疗伤，凯斯宾突然惊叫道：“看！”他正盯着那个镯子。





第七章　尤斯塔斯脱离险境


“看什么？”艾德蒙问。

“看那金子上的图案。”凯斯宾说。

“一把锤子，上面有一颗星状的钻石，”德里宁说，“哎呀，我之前看到过。”

“看到过！”凯斯宾说，“哎呀，你当然看到过，这是纳尼亚一个大家族的标志。这是奥克特西安勋爵的臂环。”

“你这坏蛋，”雷佩契普对龙说，“你吃了一个纳尼亚的勋爵？”然而，龙使劲地摇摇头。

“或许，”露西说，“它就是奥克特西安勋爵——只不过被施了魔法变成了龙。”

“那倒也未必，”艾德蒙说，“龙都爱收藏金子。不过我觉得，奥克特西安很可能就在这座岛上。”

“你是奥克特西安勋爵吗？”露西问龙。它悲伤地摇了摇头。露西又问：“那你是被施了魔法吗——我的意思是，你是一个人吗？”

它一个劲儿地猛点头。

接着又有人问——事后大家还争论到底是露西先说的还是艾德蒙先说的——“你不……不会是尤斯塔斯吧？”

尤斯塔斯直点那颗可怕的龙头，尾巴重重地击打着海面。大家都纷纷后退（还有些水手破口大骂，我就不写下来了），躲避他眼里流下来的巨大而滚烫的泪水。

露西努力安慰他，甚至鼓起勇气亲吻他长满鳞片的脸。几乎所有人都说“真倒霉”。有几个人跟尤斯塔斯保证，他们会支持他。还有很多人说，肯定有什么办法能帮他解开魔法，不消几天就会好的。当然，他们都等不及要听他的故事了，但是他没法说话。接下来的几天，尤斯塔斯好多次想在沙滩上给他们写下自己的经历。可惜，他一次都没有成功过。一开始，尤斯塔斯不知道该怎么直接讲故事，因为他从来没看过对的书。其次，龙爪上的肌肉和神经从来没学过写字，再说龙爪本来就不是用来写字的。结果，他还没来得及写完，潮水就来了，冲走了他写下的字，只留下他踩过或是尾巴不经意抽在地上的痕迹。人们看到的就是下面这个样子——小点代表被他抹掉的字：

我……我是说龙洞因为它……死了，雨很……醒来，能……从手臂摘下，哎呀烦死了……

不过，大家心里都明白，尤斯塔斯变成龙之后性格反倒好多了。他总想帮大家的忙。他飞遍整座岛，发现到处是山，只有野山羊和成群的野猪栖居在这里。他带回了许多死羊和死猪，给船上供应食物。他还是一个非常人道的杀手，因为他只要一甩尾巴就能杀死一只猎物，所以那些猎物还没反应过来就已经死了（可能到现在都还不知道自己已经死了）。当然，他自己也吃掉一些猎物，但总是独自一个人吃。因为他现在是一条龙，喜欢吃生肉，但是他没法忍受别人看到他吃得一片狼藉的样子。有一天，他回来的时候飞得又慢又累，但是扬扬得意，原来他在一个遥远的山谷里连根拔起了一棵很高的松树，把它带回了营地，可以用来做船的主桅。有时下过雨后，夜晚会变得寒冷，他就成了大家的暖炉，大家都会过来背靠在他暖和的身侧，身子就被烘得又干又暖。他一喷气，就能燃起最厉害的火焰。有时，他还会让一些人坐在他背上，带着他们去看翠绿的山坡、岩石山岭、坑状的狭窄山谷在他们下面旋转，还能看见远处东方地平线上的一个深蓝色斑点，那可能是块陆地。

被别人喜爱（这对他来说是很新鲜的事）和喜爱别人所带来的愉悦让尤斯塔斯不再绝望。因为做一条龙实在是太令人郁闷了。他每次从山间的湖泊飞过，都会被水里自己的倒影吓一跳。他讨厌自己巨大的蝙蝠似的翅膀、锯齿状的背脊，还有那尖锐弯曲的爪子。他甚至有点儿害怕一个人待着，但是和别人待在一起他又觉得难为情。晚上，要是不用当别人的热水袋，他就会偷偷从营地溜走，在树林和海之间找块地方像蛇一样蜷曲起来躺下。这种时候，雷佩契普经常安慰他，这让他感到非常意外。围坐在篝火旁的人群气氛愉快，这只高尚的老鼠会从那里悄悄离开，在龙头旁边坐下，看准风向，避开龙呼吸时鼻子里冒的烟。他告诉尤斯塔斯，发生在他身上的事情是命运无常，要是尤斯塔斯到他纳尼亚的房子里（那其实不是一个房子，而是一个洞，连一颗龙头都放不下，更别说龙的身体了），他就可以给他看很多君主、国王、公爵、骑士、诗人、情人、天文学家、哲学家和魔法师的例子，他们也曾从成功跌入窘境，其中很多人后来都重新站了起来，从此幸福地生活。也许，这些话在当时并不能让人感到欣慰，但都是出于好意，尤斯塔斯永远不会忘记。

当然，有一个问题一直像一片阴云笼罩在大家心上：他们要出航的时候，这条龙该怎么办？他在的时候，他们都尽量不说这事，但是他总是能不经意地听到一些话，比如：“他塞得进甲板的一侧吗？我们得把所有的存货放在另一侧的甲板下面，好让船保持平衡。”或者，“拖着他走可以吗？”又或者，“他能一直飞下去吗？”还有（这是最常听见的），“我们该怎么喂他呢？”可怜的尤斯塔斯越来越明白，自从他第一天上船，他就是一个十足的麻烦，现在他变成了一个更大的麻烦。这想法深入了他的头脑，就像那手镯嵌入了他的前腿。他知道，用自己尖利的牙齿去撕扯只会把情况变得更糟，但是他有时会忍不住这样做，尤其是在炎热的夜晚。





大约是他们在龙岛上岸后的第六天清晨，艾德蒙正好醒得早。天空慢慢显出了灰色，所以看得见身边和海滩之间的树干，不过别的方向看不见。他醒来的时候觉得自己好像听到了有什么东西在动，于是就用胳膊肘把自己支撑起来看看周围。不一会儿，他好像看见一个黑色的人影正在树林靠海的那边走动。他脑海中一下子就闪出一个念头：“我们真的能确定这个岛上没有当地人吗？”接着他又想那个人可能是凯斯宾——他的个头和凯斯宾差不多——但是他知道凯斯宾一直睡在他旁边，而且可以看出没有动过。他确认了一下，自己的剑还在，于是就起来一探究竟。

他轻轻地走到树林边，那个黑色的人影还在那里。他这下看清楚了这个人的个头，比凯斯宾小，又比露西大。他没有跑走。艾德蒙拔出自己的剑，正准备和他大打出手，却听见那陌生人轻声说道：“艾德蒙，是你吗？”

“是我。你是谁？”他说。

“你不认识我了？”那人说，“是我，尤斯塔斯啊。”

“天哪，”艾德蒙说，“还真是。我亲爱的伙计……”

“嘘。”尤斯塔斯说着还蹒跚了一下，似乎快要摔倒了。

“喂！”艾德蒙扶住他说道，“你怎么了？你生病了吗？”

尤斯塔斯沉默了好久，艾德蒙以为他晕过去了。但是他终于开口说道：“太可怕了。你不知道……不过现在都好了。我们能去哪里说说话吗？我现在还不想看见其他人。”

“当然了，你想去哪里都可以，”艾德蒙说，“我们可以到那边的石头上坐坐。啊呀，我见到你……呃……原来的你，真是太高兴了。你一定受苦了。”

他们走过去，坐在石头上向海湾对面望去，天色越来越亮，星星也消失了，只留下一颗低近地平线的星星独自闪烁在天空中。

“等到我能告诉其他人了，这一切都过去了，我再告诉你我是怎么变成一……一条龙的，”尤斯塔斯说，“顺便告诉你，直到那天早晨我出现在这里，你们都说‘龙’这个词，我才知道这是一条龙。我想告诉你我是怎么变回来的。”

“你说吧。”艾德蒙说。

“嗯，昨天，我度过了最痛苦的一晚，那可恶的臂环把我折磨死了……”

“现在好了吗？”

尤斯塔斯笑了，艾德蒙从没听到过尤斯塔斯这样笑。尤斯塔斯轻而易举地把手镯从手臂上褪了下来。“看，在这儿，”他说，“就我来说，要是有谁喜欢就拿去吧。对了，就像我说的，我当时正醒着，躺在那儿想自己究竟会有什么样的下场，然后——不过我得先提醒你，这可能只是个梦，我不太确定。”

“继续说。”艾德蒙耐着性子说。

“啊呀，不管怎么样，我抬起头看见了我意想不到的东西：一只巨大的狮子朝我慢慢走过来。奇怪的是，昨晚明明没有月亮，那狮子站的地方却洒着月光。它走得越来越近，我害怕极了。你可能会觉得，作为一条龙，打败一头狮子简直轻而易举。但是我对它不是那种害怕，我不怕它吃掉我，我就是觉得很恐惧——不知道你能不能理解。总之，他就这么走近我，直视着我的眼睛。我紧闭双眼，但是没什么用，因为它让我跟着它。”

“你是说它说话了？”

“我不知道。既然你提到了，我觉得它应该没有说话。反正它就是告诉我了。我知道我必须照做，所以我就站起来跟着它走。它带我走了很远的路，到了深山里。不管这狮子走到哪里，它身边都笼罩着月光。最后我们到了一座我从来没见过的山顶，那座山顶上有一个花园——有树啊，水果啊，各种各样的东西应有尽有。花园的中间有一口井。

“我知道那是一口井，因为可以看见不断有水泡从底下冒上来。这口井比大多数的井都要大——就像一个很大的圆形浴盆，大理石的台阶延伸到里面。水清澈见底，我想要是能进去洗个澡，我腿上的疼痛应该能减轻不少。但是那头狮子告诉我必须先脱衣服。再提醒你一下，我不知道它有没有说话。

“我正准备说我没法脱衣服，因为我根本就没穿，却一下想到龙跟蛇很像，而蛇可以蜕皮。啊呀，我就想，狮子说的话肯定就是这个意思。于是我开始抓扯自己的皮肤，我的鳞片就开始往下掉，落得遍地都是。于是我就抓得更深一点儿，这下，不光我的鳞片开始往下掉，连我的整个皮肤都被剥掉了，就像大病初愈的时候一样，好像自己就是一只香蕉。不一会儿，我就从这张皮里面出来了。我看到它就在我脚边，看上去很恶心。那感觉真是太妙了。于是我就走到井里去洗澡。

“就在我准备把脚放进水里时，我往下看了一眼，发现自己的皮肤还是像刚才那样又硬又粗糙，还皱巴巴的，长满了鳞片。‘哎呀，没事，’我说，‘我只是在原来那件衣服里面还穿了一件小点儿的，这件我也得脱掉。’于是我又开始抓扯自己的皮肤，这层里面的皮也剥掉了，我走出来，把它放在刚刚那张皮的边上，然后下井去洗澡。

“唉，同样的事情又发生了。我暗自想：天哪，我到底要脱掉几层皮？因为我很想洗洗我的腿，所以我又开始抓扯，像前两次一样脱掉了第三层皮，然后走了出来。但是我一看水里自己的倒影，就知道事情还是不妙。

“于是那狮子就说——不过我不知道它有没有说话——‘你得让我帮你脱衣服。’我跟你说实话，我害怕它的爪子，但是我当时快要崩溃了，所以我就仰天平躺下来，让它帮我脱。

“它一开始就撕扯得很深，我觉得好像渗到心窝里去了。它开始把皮肤剥下来的时候，我疼得要死，我从来没这么痛过。但是我之所以能忍下来，是因为把皮剥掉的感觉真是太畅快了。要是你剥掉过伤口上的痂，就知道那是什么感觉了。痛得不行——但是看到它脱落，心里真有种说不出的高兴。”

“我知道那种感觉。”艾德蒙说。

“嗯，它马上就脱掉了我那该死的皮肤，放在了草地上。之前的三次我以为自己已经把外面的皮肤都脱掉了，只不过那三次都不痛。这次剥下来的皮肤厚了很多，颜色也更黑，上面的疙瘩也更加明显。而我本身却变得像剥了皮的枝条一样光滑而柔软，整个人也小了一圈。然后它抓住我把我扔进了水里，其实我不太喜欢它这么做，因为我没有皮肤了，脆弱得很。下水以后我疼痛难忍，但是只过了一小会儿，就变得舒服极了。我刚刚开始游泳和泼水就发现我的手臂一点儿也不疼了。很快我就知道了原因，我又变回一个人了。要是我告诉你我的手臂怎么样了，你一定会觉得我在骗人。我知道我的手臂上没有一点儿肌肉，和凯斯宾的比起来简直太弱了，但是看到它们，我高兴得不得了。

“过了一会儿，狮子把我带出来，给我穿好了衣服……”

“给你穿衣服？用它的爪子给你穿吗？”

“这个嘛，我倒记不清了。但是它不知怎地就做到了，给我穿上了新衣服——其实就是我身上的衣服。接着我突然就回到了这里，所以我觉得这一定是个梦。”

“不，那不是梦，”艾德蒙说。

“为什么不是？”

“首先，你确实穿着这身衣服。还有，你从……嗯，一条龙，变回了现在的样子。”

“那你觉得这是怎么回事？”尤斯塔斯问。

“我觉得你应该是看到了阿斯兰。”艾德蒙说。

“阿斯兰！”尤斯塔斯说，“自从我们上了黎明踏浪号，我已经几次听到人们提起这个名字了。而且不知道为什么，我觉得我很讨厌这个名字。不过我当时看什么都不顺眼。那个，我想道个歉。恐怕我之前一直都太差劲了。”

“没关系，”艾德蒙说，“跟你比起来，我第一次来纳尼亚的时候还要糟糕得多。你只是个笨蛋，我当时却是个叛徒。”

“好吧，那你还是不要跟我说这件事了，”尤斯塔斯说，“可是阿斯兰是谁？你认识他吗？”

“这个嘛——他认识我，”艾德蒙说，“他是伟大的狮王，是大海外面的帝王之子，他曾经救过我，救过纳尼亚。我们都看见过他。露西看到的次数最多。我们现在去往的地方可能就是阿斯兰的国度。”

两人沉默了一会儿。最后的那颗明星也不见了。由于右边的山脉挡着，他们看不见日出，但是他们知道太阳正在升上来，因为他们头顶的天空和面前的海湾都被染成了玫瑰色。他们后面的林子里传来鹦鹉之类的鸟儿的鸣叫，他们听到了树林中的骚动，最后凯斯宾的一声号角打破了清晨的宁静，营地里的人都起来活动了。

人们正围在篝火旁吃早餐，看见艾德蒙和变回原样的尤斯塔斯走来，都兴高采烈。当然，大家都听他说了前半段的故事，想着奥克特西安勋爵是不是在几年前就死在了另一条龙的口中，又或者，那条老龙是不是就是奥克特西安勋爵本人。尤斯塔斯当时在洞里把口袋塞满了珠宝，现在都随着他那时穿的衣服一起不见了。但是也没人想回到那个山谷里去拿些财宝，至少尤斯塔斯不想。

几天之后，黎明踏浪号就重新安上了桅杆，重新油漆了一遍，还装满了补给品，已经蓄势待发准备起航了。他们上船之前，凯斯宾让人在面对海湾的一处峭壁上刻下了这些话：

龙岛

由纳尼亚国王凯斯宾等人于其执政第四年发现。

根据推测

奥克特西安勋爵卒于此地。

现在说“从那时起尤斯塔斯变了个人”，可谓恰到好处，而且非常接近事实。要是严格准确一点儿说，那就是他从那时起开始变为一个不一样的人。他有时也会故态复萌，很多时候还是很讨人厌。其中的大部分，我就不多提了。总之，他开始慢慢变好了。

奥克特西安勋爵的臂环却一波三折。尤斯塔斯不想留着它，就送给了凯斯宾。凯斯宾又送给了露西。露西也不想要。“好吧，那就随它去吧。”凯斯宾说着就把它抛向了空中。当时他们正站着看壁上的铭文。那臂环被抛了上去，在阳光下闪闪发亮，接着，像个正中目标的铁环一样，径直套中了岩石上一个突出的小角，挂在了半空中。从下面爬上去摘不到它，从上面往下爬也摘不到它。就我所知，它现在还挂在那里，可能会永远这样挂着。





第八章　两次脱险


从龙岛起航时，黎明踏浪号上的每个人都意气风发。他们一离开海湾，就遇上了顺风，第二天一早就到了那片不知名的陆地上。在尤斯塔斯还是条龙时，有些人骑在他身上飞过山头的时候看到过这里。这座低矮的绿岛无人居住，只有兔子和几只山羊。但是根据岛上石屋的废墟和火烧过发黑的地方来看，他们推测这里不久之前还有人。岛上还有一些骨头和损坏的武器。

“这准是海盗干的。”凯斯宾说。

“也有可能是龙。”艾德蒙说。

他们还在沙滩上找到了一艘皮艇，或者说皮筏子，除此之外就没有其他发现了。这艘皮艇用枝条搭框架，外面包着兽皮。船很小，只有四英尺长，里面的船桨和船的大小相称。他们觉得，这艘船要么是给小孩子做的，要么那个地方的人是矮人。雷佩契普决定留着这艘船，因为对他来说大小正好，于是这艘皮艇就被送上了大船。他们把这片陆地叫作焦岛，还没到中午就开船离开了。

之后的五天，他们都顺着东南偏南的风前进，看不见陆地，也看不见鱼，连海鸥都没有。一天，一场大雨一直下到了下午。尤斯塔斯和雷佩契普下棋，因为输了两局，又摆起了臭脾气。艾德蒙说，要是他们当时能和苏珊一起去美国就好了。露西在船尾向窗外望去，说：“嘿！我觉得雨停了。不过那是什么？”

他们听到立马站起来爬上了船尾楼，发现雨已经停了，而正在值班的德里宁也正向后紧紧盯着什么。准确一点儿说，他盯着好几个东西。那些东西看起来有点儿像光滑的圆石头，排成一条线，每个石头之间都隔了约莫四十英尺。

“那不可能是石头，”德里宁说，“五分钟前还没有那些东西呢。”

“刚刚有一个消失了。”露西说。

“是啊，现在又有一个新的出现了。”艾德蒙说。

“还在靠近我们。”尤斯塔斯说。

“该死！”凯斯宾说，“那东西整个都往这边来了。”

“陛下，那东西的速度比我们快得多，”德里宁说，“不消一分钟，它就追上我们了。”

他们都屏住了呼吸，不管是在陆地上还是在海上，被一个不知道是什么的东西追赶总归不是好事。但是，那东西一露头，竟比大家的猜想还要糟糕得多。突然，在离他们左舷一个板球场长度的地方，一个骇人的脑袋钻出了海面。那颗脑袋上一块绿一块红，布满了紫色的疹子——除了贝类附着的地方——脑袋上面没长耳朵，形状则像一个马头。它巨大的眼睛可以观察黑暗的海底，张开的嘴巴里长着两排鱼一样尖利的牙齿。他们本以为脑袋下面是一根巨大的脖子，但是看着那脖子没完没了地伸出海面，所有人都知道了那不是脖子，而是它的身体。最后他们终于看出来了，那是一条巨大的海蛇。在这之前，他们中的许多人都想着，要是能瞧一瞧海蛇就好了，多么愚蠢荒唐啊！它巨大的尾巴时不时地伸出海面，从远处就能清清楚楚地看见上面的褶皱。现在，它的头已经远远地高出了船桅。

大家连忙拿起武器，可是什么也做不了，因为那怪物远在他们的攻击范围之外。“射击！射击！”弓箭手头领喊道。有一些人遵照命令做了，但是海蛇的皮像钢板似的，箭只是轻轻地擦过去了。好一会儿，大家一动不动，提心吊胆，盯着它的眼睛和嘴巴，不知道它会往哪里猛扑过来。

但是它没有扑过来，而是把脑袋沿着桅杆的帆桁探过船身。这会儿它的头就在桅顶观测台的边上，它不停地往前伸，把头伸到了右舷墙的上方。接着，又开始往下伸——不是伸向站满了人的甲板上，而是伸向了海里。这下，整条船都在蛇身的弧圈里了。紧接着，这个弧圈开始收紧。原本在右舷一侧的蛇身都快碰到黎明踏浪号的舷侧了。

这时，尤斯塔斯（之前一直努力好好表现，不过后来的那场雨和棋又把他打回了原形）生平第一次做出了一件勇敢的事。此时，他正佩带着一把凯斯宾借给他的剑。正当蛇身快接近右舷舷侧时，他一跃而起跳上了舷墙，用尽全力砍向它。结果，他什么都没做成，只是让凯斯宾那把第二好的剑粉身碎骨，不过这对一个新手来说无可厚非。

要不是那时雷佩契普大声喊道：“别打！推！”别人早就跟他一起动手了。雷佩契普居然劝人不要打，这真是太不寻常了。眼下明明情况危急，大家还是被引得转过身去看他。他一下就跳上舷墙，挡在前面，把他毛茸茸的后背倚在海蛇长满鳞片又黏糊糊的巨大身躯上，开始使劲往外推。很多人一下明白过来他想干吗，也冲向船的两边这样做。不一会儿，那海蛇的头又露了出来，不过这次是从左舷侧露出来的，背对着他们，这下大家都明白是怎么回事了。

那畜生竟然把身子绕成一个圈箍在了黎明破浪号上，还把圈越收越紧。等到它缠得够紧——啪的一声——船就会变成一摊碎片浮在海面上，它就能在水里把他们一个一个地收拾了。他们要想活命，只能想办法把这个圈往后推，让它从船尾滑出去，要不然就（换种办法）把船往前推，脱出这个圈。

雷佩契普独自去推当然没什么用，简直无异于他想举起一座大教堂，其他人把他推到一边的时候，他已经竭尽全力了。一时间，除了露西和雷佩契普（他已经晕过去了），全船的伙计们已经沿着两侧的舷墙排成了两列，相互之间前胸贴着后背，让所有人的重量都落到了最后那个人的身上，拼了命地推。他们熬了几秒钟（痛苦得像过了几个小时），可是什么变化也没有。他们的关节咯咯作响，汗如雨下，累得气喘吁吁。接着他们感觉船开始动了。他们看见蛇绕成的圈离桅杆远了一点儿，但是与此同时，那个圈也缩小了许多。不料，危险已经近在眼前。他们不知能不能让船尾楼顺利地从这个圈里脱出，这个圈是不是已经太紧了。是啊，这个圈刚好套进来。海蛇靠在船尾楼的栏杆上休息。船尾楼上一下子蹿出许多人，这下就好多了。海蛇的身体太低了，他们可以在船尾楼上站成一列一起用力推。他们满心以为离胜利不远了，可是，大家突然想起来了，黎明踏浪号高耸的雕花船尾，那个龙尾，要把蛇身从那里推出去是绝对不可能的。

“拿把斧头来，”凯斯宾嘶吼道，“继续用力推！”露西知道每样东西摆在哪儿，她正站在甲板上抬头观察着船尾楼上的状况，听到凯斯宾的话，她立马下去拿上了斧头，急匆匆地爬上了船尾楼的楼梯。结果她刚到上面，就听见一声轰然巨响，像是大树倒下来的声音。接着，船开始摇晃，往前急冲了出去。原来就在那一刻，海蛇把圈一下子收紧了，也许是因为它被推得太猛了，也可能是它一时犯蠢，整个雕花船尾都被折断了。这下，船终于逃脱了它的束缚。

其他人都筋疲力尽，只有露西看见他们身后几码远的地方，海蛇的身体弯成的圈一下子缩小了，扑通一下淹没在了水中。露西一直说，她看见那条海蛇的脸上露出了白痴般的满足表情（当然，她那时非常激动，那也许只是她的想象罢了）。毋庸置疑的是，这条海蛇太蠢了，它没来追船，反而把头转过去开始嗅探自己的身体，以为在那里能找到船的残骸似的。但是，黎明踏浪号已经乘着清风逃之夭夭了，大家在甲板上坐的坐，躺的躺，喘着气呻吟着。过了一会儿，他们才开始谈论这件事，嘲笑起这条蛇来。甜酒端上来时，他们热烈欢呼，大家都称赞尤斯塔斯和雷佩契普很英勇（虽然没帮上什么忙）。

接着他们又在海上航行了三天，放眼望去，只看得到无边无际的天和海，其他什么也没有。第四天，刮起了北风，海面开始升高，到中午的时候，狂风大作。就在那时，他们看见左舷船头方向有一块陆地。

“陛下，请您恩准，”德里宁说，“让我们划桨过去，把船停在海湾里，去那儿避避风，等到风停了再说。”凯斯宾答应了。不过顶着大风划桨，他们晚上才终于到达了那片陆地。他们驶入了一个天然的港湾，刚一抛锚，天色就暗了下来。但是当天晚上没有人上岸。第二天早上，他们发现自己身处一个绿色的港湾中，那里凹凸不平，看起来冷冷清清的，斜坡通向一个岩石山峰。山峰的北侧，大风呼啸，云朵被挟卷着滚滚而来。他们把小船放到水面上，把空水桶全部装在船上。

“德里宁，我们到哪条河里打水？”凯斯宾一边在船尾座板坐下，一边说，“看起来有两条河汇入这个海湾。”

“陛下，哪条都行，”德里宁说，“不过我觉得去右舷那边的那条河会更近一点儿——就是东边那条。”

“要下雨了。”露西说。

“真的下雨了！”艾德蒙说，这时雨滴已经砸下来了，“我说，我们去另一条河打水吧。那里有树，我们能躲躲雨。”

“是啊，我们去那边吧，”尤斯塔斯说，“我们没必要淋雨。”

但是德里宁一直稳稳地往右舷划船，就像那些讨厌的人开车一样，尽管旁边有人跟他们说开错了路，他们还是以每小时四十英里的速度一股脑往前开。

“德里宁，他们说的是对的，”凯斯宾说，“你怎么不掉头去西边那条河呢？”

“陛下您说了算。”德里宁有点儿不快地说。他昨天为天气担心了一整天，也不喜欢没什么出海经验的人给他提意见。但是他还是改变了航向，事后证明了他这么做是对的。

他们打完水，雨也停了。凯斯宾、尤斯塔斯、佩文西家的孩子和雷佩契普决定走上山顶，从那上面四处看看。山坡上到处都是粗草和欧石南，他们艰难地往上爬，一路上既没看见人，也没看见野兽，只看到了海鸥。他们到达山顶时，发现这是一个很小的岛屿，面积不过二十英亩。从这个高度俯瞰，海面比从黎明踏浪号的甲板，甚至桅顶观测台上看去都要显得更宽阔、更荒凉。

“喂，真是疯了，”尤斯塔斯看着东方的地平线对露西低声说道，“我们根本不知道会到哪里去，却这么一直往前航行。”但是他说这些只是出于习惯，并不是像以前那样故意惹人讨厌。

冷飕飕的风还在不断地从北面吹过来，山上太冷了，根本待不住。

“我们回去别走原来那条路了，”他们往回走时露西说，“我们往前走一点儿，沿着另一条河下山，就是德里宁想去的那条河。”

大家都同意这么做，大约十五分钟后，他们已经到了另一条河的源头。这里比他们预想的还要有趣。一个深深的山间小湖，四周都是悬崖，只在靠海的一边留下一个窄窄的口子，水就从这里流向大海。到了这里，风终于吹不到他们了，大家都在悬崖上的欧石南丛中坐下休息。

所有人都坐下来了，但是其中一个人却又很快跳了起来，原来是艾德蒙。

“这岛上尽是些尖利的石头，”他在欧石南丛里摸索着说，“那可恶的东西在哪儿？……啊，我找到了……啊呀！这根本不是石头，是剑柄。不，天哪，这是一把完整的剑，这上面的铁锈怎么这么厚啊。一定落在这儿好多年了。”

“看它的样子，这也是把纳尼亚的剑。”凯斯宾说。这时大家都围拢过来看。

“我也坐在了什么东西上，”露西说，“硬硬的。”大家过去一看，原来是一副盔甲的残片。这时，大家都趴在地上，在欧石南丛中到处摸索。他们一个接一个地搜出了头盔、匕首还有几枚硬币。不是卡罗门的新月，而是真正的纳尼亚的“狮子”和“树”。你在海狸大坝或者柏卢纳的市场上随处都可以见到这样的货币。

“看样子，这可能是我们要寻找的七勋爵之一留下的全部东西了。”艾德蒙说。

“我也是这么想的，”凯斯宾说，“我在想这是哪一位勋爵。从匕首上看不出来他的身份。我还想知道他是怎么死的。”

“还有，我们怎么为他报仇。”雷佩契普补充道。

艾德蒙是这群人里面唯一一个读过几个侦探故事的人，他一直在思考。

“看这里，”他说，“这件事非常蹊跷。他不可能是在打斗中丧命的。”

“为什么？”凯斯宾问。

“这里没有骨头，”艾德蒙说，“如果是敌人，就会带走盔甲，留下尸体。但谁听说过有人打赢了之后却带走尸体留下盔甲的？”

“也许他是被野兽吃掉了。”露西提出。

“这野兽也太聪明了，”艾德蒙说，“还会把人的盔甲脱下来。”

“也许是一条龙？”凯斯宾说。

“不可能，”尤斯塔斯说，“龙可办不到。我是知道的。”

“好吧，无论如何，我们还是先离开这里吧。”露西说。艾德蒙提出骨头的问题后，她再也不想坐下来了。

“听你的，”凯斯宾边起身边说，“我觉得这些东西一件也不值得带走。”

他们下山来到湖边，绕到了水往外流的小口子那里，站在那儿望着深深的湖水，周围都是悬崖。要是天很热的话，肯定会有一些人忍不住下水洗个澡，而且大家都会喝水喝个痛快。其实，即便只是这样不热的天气，尤斯塔斯已经准备弯腰用手舀水喝了，不过雷佩契普和露西不约而同地大叫了一声：“看！”他顿时忘了喝水，往他们指的地方看去。

水池底是灰蓝色的大石块砌成的，湖水清澈透明。池底分明躺着一个真人大小的人像，而且是金子做的。它的脸朝下，手臂高举过头顶。正当他们看着它时，云层散开了，阳光照耀下来。金色的人像从头到脚被照得金光闪闪。露西觉得这是她见过的最美丽的雕像了。

“好！”凯斯宾吹了一声口哨说，“这倒值得一看！不知道我们能不能把它捞上来？”

“陛下，我们可以潜水下去打捞。”雷佩契普说。

“没用的，”艾德蒙说，“不管怎么说，要是这是真的纯金的话就太重了，根本捞不上来。而且，这水池估计有十二到十五英尺那么深。不过，稍微等一下。幸亏我还带着一支矛。我们来看看这水池到底有多深。凯斯宾，我身子探向水面的时候，抓住我的手。”于是凯斯宾拉着他的手，艾德蒙则往前斜身子，开始把他的矛往水里伸。

矛伸进水里还不到一半，露西就说：“我根本不相信这雕像是金子做的。只是因为光线的缘故。你的矛看起来也是金色的。”

艾德蒙突然松开了他的矛，几个人立马异口同声地问道：“怎么了？”

“我拿不住了，”艾德蒙喘着气说，“好像太沉了。”

“它现在沉到底了，”凯斯宾说，“露西是对的。它看起来和雕像的颜色一样。”

但艾德蒙觉得自己的靴子好像有些不对劲，他正弯下身子看，却一下子又绷直了身体，用尖锐的声音大叫：“后退！离水面远点儿！你们都后退！马上！！”

他的声音让人不敢不依他的话。他们都后退了，眼睛都盯着艾德蒙。

“看，”艾德蒙说，“看我的靴尖。”

“它们看起来有点儿发黄。”尤斯塔斯开口说道。

“它们变成金子了，纯金的，”艾德蒙立马打断了他，“看看，摸一摸，皮革已经从靴子上脱离了，像铅一样重。”

“阿斯兰在上！”凯斯宾说，“你的意思该不会是……”

“是的，我就是这个意思，”艾德蒙说，“这水会把东西变成金子。它把矛变成了金子，所以矛才会变得那么沉。而且我的靴尖只是稍微沾到了点儿水，就变成了金子，还好我没光着脚。底下那个可怜的家伙——唉，你们知道是怎么回事了吧？”

“所以那根本不是一座雕像。”露西低声说道。

“对，现在整件事情真相大白了。他在一个大热天来到了这里。他在悬崖上脱掉了衣服，就是我们刚刚坐着的地方。他的衣服要么腐烂掉了，要么被鸟儿叼去铺在窝里了。但是盔甲还留在那里。然后他就潜进了水里，结果……”

“别说了，”露西说，“太可怕了。”

艾德蒙说：“好险啊。”

“确实好险啊，”雷佩契普说，“任何人的手指、脚、胡须或者尾巴，都随时可能滑进水里。”

“虽然如此，”凯斯宾说，“我们还是试验一下吧。”他弯下腰，折下一根欧石南的花枝。接着，他小心翼翼地跪在水池旁边，拿着花枝在水中轻轻蘸了一下。他放进去时是欧石南，拿出来时却是个一模一样的纯金欧石南模型，轻重软硬都像铅一般。

“拥有这个岛的国王，”凯斯宾缓慢地说，他说话时激动得脸都涨红了，“马上就会成为世界上最富有的国王。我宣布，这片土地永远归纳尼亚所有。以后，这里就叫作金水岛。并且，我要求你们所有人对此保密。不能让别人知道这件事。连德里宁也不能告诉——泄密者处死，听见了吗？”

“你在跟谁说话？”艾德蒙说，“我可不是你的下属。要反过来才对。我是纳尼亚旧时的四位君主之一，你应该效忠于我哥哥至尊王。”

“所以呢，艾德蒙国王？”凯斯宾把手放在他的剑柄上说道。

“哎呀，你们俩，都别再吵了，”露西说，“跟男孩子一起，就是这点最讨厌了。你们都是喜欢虚张声势、恃强凌弱的白痴——唉！……”她突然不出声了，而是倒吸了一口气。接着，其他人都看到了她所看到的东西。

他们上方的灰色山坡上——因为欧石南还没开花，所以看上去是灰色的——一头巨大的狮子缓缓走过，人们从来没见过这么大的狮子。它没有发出声音，也没有看向他们。太阳这时分明被云层挡住了，可是它浑身闪着金光，就像在阳光的照耀下似的。事后，露西形容这个场景：“它的个头有大象那么大。”但是另一回她又说：“它的个头跟拉货车的马一样大。”但是它的个头大小不重要。没人敢问这是什么。他们都知道这就是阿斯兰。

没有人看到他去了什么地方，也不知道他是怎么去的。他们面面相觑，就像刚刚从睡梦中醒来。

“我们刚刚在说什么？”凯斯宾问道，“我是不是表现得像个浑蛋？”

“陛下，”雷佩契普说，“这是一个被诅咒的地方。我们快点儿回船上吧。如果我有荣幸为这个岛屿命名的话，我会叫它死水岛。”

“雷佩契普，这倒是个好名字，”凯斯宾说，“但是我现在才想起来，我也不知道为什么。不过天气似乎好转了，我想德里宁大概愿意起航了。我们有太多的事要跟他说了。”

但实际上他们没有多少要说的，因为过去那一个小时的记忆已经变得模模糊糊的了。

“几位殿下上船时好像都着了魔似的。”几个小时后德里宁对莱斯这样说。那时，黎明踏浪号正在海上航行，而死水岛已经落到地平线之下，看不见了。“他们在那里遇上什么事了。我只知道一件事，他们觉得找到了我们正在寻找的七勋爵之一的尸体。”

“真的吗，船长？”莱斯说道，“那这下已经找到三个了。还剩四个。以这样的速度，我们可能过了新年就可以马上回家了。这倒也是一件好事。我的烟快抽完了。晚安，船长。”





第九章　声音的岛屿


刮了好久的西北风，现在开始刮西风了。每天早晨，当太阳从海面上升起时，黎明踏浪号的弧形船头就正好把太阳分成了两半。有些人觉得太阳看起来比在纳尼亚看上去来得更大，但其他人不这么觉得。他们顺着一股温和而平稳的风不断前行，既没有看到鱼和海鸥，也看不到船和海岸。他们的储备又快用完了。他们不禁在心里想，也许他们来到了一片没有尽头的大海。但是就在他们觉得还可以冒险继续东行的最后一天，天刚刚亮，一块云朵似的低地就出现在了太阳和他们之间。

下午三点左右，他们把船停靠在一个宽阔的海湾里，登上了那片低地。这个地方和他们以前见过的完全不同。他们穿过沙滩后，发现这里沉寂又空旷，好像无人居住似的，但是他们面前的草坪非常平整，草又短又滑，就像那些英式大房子周围有十个园丁照看的草坪一样。这里有许多树，一棵棵相隔均匀，地上也没有残枝落叶。时而传来鸽子咕咕的叫声，但除此之外就没有别的声音了。

过了一会儿，他们来到了一条又长又直的沙子铺成的小路上，上面没有一棵杂草，路的两边都是树木。在这条路的另一端，他们看到了一所房子——长长的一排，灰色的房子，在午后的阳光下显得格外宁静。

他们刚走上这条小路，露西就发现她的鞋里有一块小石头。在这个陌生的地方，如果她把石头拿出来时让别人等等她，也许是比较明智的做法。但她没有。她悄悄地走到后面，坐下来脱鞋。她的鞋带打了个结。

她还没解开鞋带，别人已走到前面老远了。等她把那块石头拿出来，再把鞋子穿上时，她已经听不见他们的声音了。但她马上又听到了别的声音。那声音不是从房子那边传来的。

她听到的是一阵阵砰砰的重击声。听起来像几十个强壮的工人在使劲地用巨大的木槌砸地面。那声音很快离她越来越近。她已经背靠着一棵树坐在了地上，因为她爬不上那棵树，所以她没有其他办法，只能坐在那里一动不动，紧紧地贴在树上，希望自己不会被看到。

砰，砰，砰……不管是什么东西，总之现在一定很近了，她都能感觉到地面的晃动了。但她什么也看不见。她想，那个东西——或者那些东西——一定就在她身后。但是，她面前的小路上又开始砰砰作响。她知道那东西就在那条路上，不仅仅是凭声音判断出来的，她还看到了沙子飞扬起来，就像地面被重重地打了一拳。但她看不见是什么东西在敲打地面。接着，所有的砰砰声都聚集在离她二十英尺远的地方，然后戛然而止。接着传来了说话声。

这实在是太可怕了，因为她根本一个人都看不见。那整个公园一样的地方看起来仍旧像他们刚刚登陆时那样安静而空旷。然而，离她只有几英尺远的地方，一个声音说话了。说的是：“伙计们，我们的机会来了。”

顿时，其他的声音齐声回答：“听啊。听啊。他说‘我们的机会来了’。头儿，说得好。你这句话说得可太对了。”

“我的意思，”第一个声音继续说，“就是，我们到岸边去，拦住他们，别让他们上船，每个人都拿好武器。他们如果要出海就抓住他们。”

“对，就得这么干，”其他的声音都喊道，“头儿，你这个办法真是妙极了。头儿，继续说。这个办法再好不过了。”

“那么，动起来，伙计们，拿出劲头来，”第一个声音说，“我们出发吧。”

“头儿，说得太对了。”其他人说，“这个命令真是棒极了。我们自己也正想这么说呢。我们走吧。”

突然，又响起了砰砰的声音——一开始很响，但很快声音就越来越弱，最后在去往海边的路上消失了。

露西知道，没有时间坐着想这些看不见的怪物到底是什么了。砰砰声一消失，她就站起来，飞快地沿着小路跑，想赶紧追上其他人。无论如何得警告他们一下。

当这一切发生的时候，其他人已经到了房子那儿。那是一栋低矮的建筑——只有两层楼高，是用圆润好看的石头砌成的，有许多窗户，常春藤在墙上半遮半掩。一切都是那么的宁静。尤斯塔斯说：“我觉得这是所空房子。”但凯斯宾默默地指了指从烟囱里冒出来的烟。

他们发现了一个敞开着的大门，于是穿过门，走进了一个铺着石块的庭院。在这里，他们第一次觉察到这个岛有些古怪。院子的中央有一个水泵，水泵下面有一个水桶。这没什么奇怪的。但水泵的把手正在上下移动，可是并没有人动它。

“这里有魔法在起作用。”凯斯宾说。

“机械装置！”尤斯塔斯说，“我相信我们终于来到了一个文明的地方。”

这时露西满头大汗地在他们身后跑进院子里，气喘吁吁。她压低嗓门，轻声告诉他们自己刚才听到的事情。他们有点儿明白了，就连他们之中最勇敢的人也神色凝重起来。

“看不见的敌人，”凯斯宾喃喃自语，“不让我们上船。这可难办了。”

“露，你不知道他们是什么怪物吗？”艾德蒙问道。

“艾德，我都看不见他们，怎么知道他们是什么？”

“他们的脚步声听起来像是人类的吗？”

“我没有听到脚步声——只听到说话声和一种可怕的撞击声以及砰砰声——就像一个木槌。”

“我在想，”雷佩契普说，“要是用剑刺进他们的身体，我们是不是就能看见他们了？”

“看来我们得弄明白这件事，”凯斯宾说，“不过我们还是从大门出去吧，水泵那里有个人听得到我们说话。”

他们出来后回到了那条小路上，那里有树遮挡，他们一行人看起来不那么显眼。“这样做其实没什么用，”尤斯塔斯说，“你想躲开那些你看不见的人。其实他们可能就在我们旁边。”

“那么，德里宁，”凯斯宾说，“要是我们放弃这条小船，去海湾的另一边，向黎明踏浪号发出信号，让他们把船开过来接我们，怎么样？”

“陛下，这里的水对黎明踏浪号来说太浅了。”德里宁说。

“我们可以游泳。”露西说。

“各位殿下，”雷佩契普说，“请听我说。面对一个看不见的敌人，要是想偷偷摸摸地躲开，那是不可能的。要是他们想跟我们打起来，我们肯定跑不了。不管怎么样，我宁愿跟他们正面对战，也不想让他们抓住尾巴。”

“我觉得雷佩这次说得对。”艾德蒙说。

“当然，”露西说，“如果莱斯和黎明踏浪号上的人看到我们在岸上打斗，他们就能帮帮我们了。”

“但如果他们看不到敌人，就不会知道我们在打斗，”尤斯塔斯可怜兮兮地说，“他们会认为我们只是在对着空气舞剑玩。”

他说完，大家都沉默了。

“好了，”最后凯斯宾说话了，“我们动手吧。我们必须面对他们。大家互相握握手——露西，把箭上弦——其他所有人，把剑拔出来——现在就开始吧。也许他们会选择谈判。”

他们回海滩的时候，草地和大树都异常平静。他们到了那儿，看见船好端端地在原来的地方，光滑的沙滩上一个人也没有。不止一个人怀疑，露西告诉他们的一切是不是她臆想出来的。可是他们还没走到沙地上，空气中就有一个声音说话了：“别再走了，各位大人，别再往前走了，”这声音说，“我们得先和你们谈谈。我们有五十多个人，手里都拿着武器。”

“听啊，听啊，”其他的声音齐声喊道，“这是我们的头儿。他的话不会有假。他说的是实话，真的。”

“我看不见这五十位勇士。”雷佩契普说。

“对，没错，”那个头儿说，“你看不见我们。为什么会看不见呢？因为我们是隐形的。”

“继续说，头儿，继续说，”其他的声音说，“你的话说得太好了。这答案再好不过了。”

“安静，雷佩，”凯斯宾说，接着他用更响亮的声音说：“隐形人，你们想要干什么？我们做了什么得罪你们了？”

“我们要找那个小女孩帮我们做件事。”头儿的声音说。（其他人解释说，他们也正想这么说。）

“小女孩！”雷佩契普说，“这位小姐可是一位女王。”

“我们不知道什么女王，”头儿说，（“我们不知道，我们不知道。”其他人附和道。）“但是我们需要她办点儿事。”

“什么事？”露西说。

“如果这会威胁到女王陛下的尊严或安全的话，”雷佩契普又说道，“我们会誓死和你们战斗到底，我们战死前能杀掉多少人一定惊掉你们的下巴。”

“好吧，”头儿说，“这件事说来话长。要不我们坐下来说？”

这一提议得到了其他声音的热烈赞同，但是纳尼亚的人们依然站着。

“好吧，”头儿说，“事情是这样的。很久以前，这个岛属于一个伟大的魔法师。我们都是——或许不妨说，我们是——他的仆人。好吧，长话短说，我说的这个魔法师，他让我们做一些我们不喜欢做的事情。为什么不喜欢呢？因为我们不想做。于是，这个魔法师就大发雷霆。我该告诉你们，因为他是这个岛的主人，不习惯有人违抗他的命令。你知道吗，他特别直率。让我看看我刚说到哪儿了？哦，对了，这个魔法师接着就上楼去了（你们得知道，因为他把所有有魔法的东西都放在楼上，而我们都住在楼下），他上楼之后就给我们下了咒。这个咒语会把人变丑。在我看来，你们看不见我们真该谢天谢地，如果你们现在看见我们的模样，绝对不会相信我们变丑之前长什么样。你们真的不会相信。我们当时丑成那样，看着彼此都觉得无法忍受。然后我们做了什么？好吧，我来告诉你们我们做了什么。我们一直等到这个魔法师大概睡午觉了，就蹑手蹑脚地上楼去看他的魔法书，看看我们能不能破解这个把人变丑的魔法，真是胆大包天。但是我们当时都冒着冷汗直打哆嗦，我没有骗你。不过，不管你们信不信，我向你们保证，我们找不到什么咒语可以帮我们摆脱丑陋。时间就这样过去了，我们担心这位老先生随时可能醒来——我浑身是汗，我没有骗你——好吧，长话短说，不管我们做得对不对，最后我们看到了一个可以让人隐形的咒语。我们宁愿变成隐形的，也不想继续如此丑陋。为什么？因为我们觉得这样更好。我的小女儿和这位小女孩差不多年纪，她被下咒之前多甜美啊，虽然现在——还是少说为妙——嗨，我的小女儿念了咒语，因为咒语只能让一个小女孩或者魔法师自己来念，否则就不起作用。为什么不起作用呢？因为什么也不会发生。于是我的克莉普西念了这个咒语，我应该告诉你们她念得棒极了，而我们都像希望的那样，变成隐形的了。我向你保证，不用看到彼此的脸真是一种解脱。无论如何，一开始是这样的。不过，我们最终还是厌倦了隐形。还有另外一件事。我们没想到，这个魔法师（就是我刚才说的那个）也不见了。从那以后我们再也没见过他。所以我们不知道他是死了还是离开了，或者他只是坐在楼上，我们看不见他而已，也许是下楼了，在那里隐身了。而且，相信我，用耳朵根本听不出来，因为他总是光着脚到处走，跟大猫似的不发出声音。我坦率地告诉你们吧，我们的神经根本承受不了。”

头儿说的故事就是这样，只不过被我缩短了，因为我忽略了其他声音说的话。实际上，他每说六七个字，他们就要打断他说话，表示赞同和鼓励，让纳尼亚人都快不耐烦了。故事说完后，大家沉默了许久。

“可是，”露西终于开口说道，“这一切跟我们有什么关系呢？我不是很明白。”

“哎呀，天哪，我不会漏说了重点吧？”头儿的声音说。

“你漏了，你漏了，”其他声音热情澎湃地吼道，“谁都会说漏。继续说，头儿，继续说。”

“好吧，我不用把整个故事再讲一遍吧？”头儿的声音说。

“不用，当然不用。”凯斯宾和艾德蒙说。

“那么，概括地说，”头儿的声音说，“我们等了这么久，终于等到了一个从外面来的漂亮的小女孩，就是你，小姐——希望你愿意上楼，找到魔法书里破解隐身术的咒语，然后念出来。我们都发过誓，第一批登陆这个岛的陌生人（我是说，如果其中有一个漂亮的小女孩的话，如果没有就是另外一回事了），除非帮我们解开咒语，否则我们不会让他们活着离开。所以，诸位，如果这个小女孩不帮我们办到的话，我们只能忍痛杀了你们。可以说，这只是个交易，希望你们不要见怪。”

“我没看见你们的武器，”雷佩契普说，“武器也是隐形的吗？”他还没说完，大家就听到嗖的一声，只见身后的一棵树上扎着一支矛，还在颤动着。

“那是支矛。”头儿的声音说。

“是啊，头儿，是啊，”其他人说，“你说得太好啦。”

“它是从我手里扔出去的，”头儿的声音继续说，“一旦离开我们，它们就能被看到。”

“可是，你们为什么要我去做这件事呢？”露西问道，“为什么你们自己的人不去？你们之中没有女孩吗？”

“我们不敢，我们不敢，”所有的声音都说，“我们不会再上楼了。”

“换句话说，”凯斯宾说，“你们不敢让自己的姐妹和女儿们面对这样的危险，却要这位小姐去冒险！”

“说得对，说得对，”所有的声音都兴高采烈地说，“你说得太好了。啊，你肯定受过些教育。谁都看得出来。”

“哼，真是太离谱了……”艾德蒙开口了，但露西打断了他的话。

“我要在晚上上楼，还是在白天？”

“噢，白天，当然是白天，”头儿的声音说，“不是晚上。没人要求你那样做。摸着黑上楼，啊？”

“好吧，那我答应你们。”露西说。“不，”她转身对其他人说，“别想着阻拦我。难道你们看不出来这样没用吗？他们有几十个人。我们不能和他们打起来。反过来还有一线生机。”

“但是那里有一个魔法师！”凯斯宾说。

“我知道，”露西说，“但是也许他并不像他们说的那么坏。难道你们没看出来这些人不太勇敢吗？”

“他们肯定不太聪明。”尤斯塔斯说。

“露，听我说，”艾德蒙说，“我们不能让你去做这么危险的事。你去问雷佩契普，我肯定他也会这么说。”

“但这是为了救你们，也是为了救我自己，”露西说，“我跟大家一样，不想被人用看不见的剑剁成碎片。”

“女王陛下说得对，”雷佩契普说，“如果我们打一仗，保证能救得了女王陛下，那我们现在要做的事就很简单了。可是在我看来，我们保证不了。他们要求她做的事也绝不会有损女王陛下的尊严，而且这是一种高尚英勇的行为。如果女王有心去冒险见见那位魔法师，我不反对。”

大家都知道雷佩契普天不怕地不怕，所以他能大言不惭地说出这些话。而总是胆小害怕的男孩子们却涨红了脸。尽管如此，道理这么清楚，他们也只能让步了。他们宣布决定时，那些隐形的人发出了响亮的欢呼声，头儿就邀请纳尼亚人一起吃晚饭，庆祝一晚（其他人也都热烈地表示支持）。尤斯塔斯并不想接受邀请。但是露西说：“我肯定他们不是坏人。他们根本不像坏人。”其他人也都同意她说的话。于是，伴随着巨大的砰砰声，他们都回到了那所房子里。他们到院子里时，地上的石板和回声把这声音变得更响了。





第十章　魔法师的书


隐形人盛情款待了他们的客人。看着盘碟上了桌子，却不见有人端着，真是太有趣了。你一定会觉得隐形的手端盘子一定是水平地往前移，即便只是这样也够有趣的了。可情况不是这样的。大大小小的盘子是蹦蹦跳跳地沿着长长的餐厅前进。盘子每跳一下，就蹦到离地十五英尺高的地方，接着又开始往下掉，突然停在离地大约三英尺的地方。要是盘子里装着汤或者炖菜，那可就糟糕了。

“我对这些人开始好奇了，”尤斯塔斯低声对艾德蒙说，“你觉得他们到底是不是人类？在我看来，他们倒更像是大蚱蜢或者大青蛙。”

“看起来真是这样。”艾德蒙说，“但是不要跟露西提蚱蜢什么的。她不太喜欢昆虫，尤其是大昆虫。”

要是这顿饭没那么混乱，或者对话不总是意见一致，那就会好多了。那些隐形人对什么事都意见一致。而且他们说的总是一些显而易见的事儿，比如：“我总是说，要是一个人饿了，就会想吃点儿食物。”或者是：“天要黑了，一到晚上总是要天黑。”甚至会说：“你们从海上过来。海水是湿湿的吧？”露西正好可以从座位上看见通往楼梯口的漆黑走道，她忍不住往那里看，心里想着明天早晨走上楼梯会看见什么。不过从其他方面来说，这顿饭也还不错。有蘑菇汤、煮鸡、煮火腿、鹅莓、红醋栗、凝乳、奶油、牛奶和蜂蜜酒。其他人都喜欢蜂蜜酒，但尤斯塔斯事后很后悔自己喝了酒。

第二天早晨露西醒来时，心情就像准备去考试或者看牙医似的。这是一个美好的早晨，蜜蜂在她的窗边嗡嗡作响，草坪看起来很像英格兰的某个地方。她起床穿衣，尽量像平时一样吃早餐、说话。吃完早餐，“头儿”告诉她应该上楼做些什么。于是，她向其他人告别，什么话也没说，走到楼梯口，头也不回地上楼了。

幸好，楼梯上很亮。因为第一段楼梯上面就有一扇窗户对着她。她走在那段楼梯上，一直能听到楼下大厅里一个老式立钟发出的嘀嗒声。她走到了楼梯间的平台上，左转走上了第二段楼梯。在那之后，她再也听不见钟的声音了。

她到了楼上。只见一条又长又宽的走廊，另一头远远地有一扇大窗户。显然，这条走廊贯穿了整座房子。走廊上有雕花，镶着木板，还铺着地毯，两边开了很多扇门。她一动不动地站着，这里听不见老鼠的吱吱声，听不见苍蝇的嗡嗡声，也听不见窗帘晃动的声音，什么声音都没有——只听见她自己怦怦的心跳声。

“左边最后一个门。”她对自己说。要走到最后一扇门确实有点儿难。要走到那里，她得经过一个又一个的房间。魔法师可能在其中的任何一间屋子里，他有可能睡着，也有可能醒着，或者是隐身的，甚至可能已经死了。但是她不能再想这种事了。她开始艰难地前进。地毯特别厚，她走在上面悄无声息。

“现在还没什么好怕的。”露西告诉自己。这条走廊十分静谧，洒满了阳光，不过有点儿太安静了。要是门上没有涂着深红色的奇怪标志就好了。那些标志歪歪扭扭的，看上去很复杂，显然有什么意义，而且很可能不是什么好的含义。要是墙上没有挂着那些面具，那也会好一些。说起来那些面具也不丑——或者说没那么丑——但是那些空空的眼窝看起来确实有点儿瘆人。要是你任由自己想象，你很快就会想，只要你转身背对着这些面具，它们就会做些什么事。

大概走过了六扇门之后，她真被吓了一大跳。那一瞬间，她几乎可以肯定，有一张长着胡子的邪恶小脸从墙上冒出来，对她做了个鬼脸。她逼自己停下来看看。那根本不是一张脸，而是一面小镜子，大小和形状都正好和她的脸差不多。镜子上面盖着头发，下面垂着胡须。所以你照镜子的时候，那头发和胡子就像长在你脸上一样。“我走过去的时候恰好用余光扫到了镜子里的自己，”露西自言自语道，“原来就是这么回事。这也没什么嘛。”但是她不喜欢自己的脸配上那头发和胡子的样子，于是继续往前走。（我不是魔法师，所以不知道带胡子的镜子是用来做什么的。）

露西还没走到左边的最后一扇门，就开始怀疑，她往前走的时候，这条走廊是不是变长了，这是不是也是房子的魔法。不过，她最终还是走进了那扇门。门是开着的。

那是一个很大的房间，有三面大窗户，书从地板上一直摞到了天花板。露西从来没见过这么多书，有小巧的，有笨重的，还有比你见过的任何教堂的《圣经》都要大的。这些书都是皮面精装的，闻起来就有一种古老、博学的味道，而且还带着魔法气质。但是之前已经有人告诉她了，她不用操心这些书。因为那本书，那本魔法书，就在房间正中的一张书桌上。她知道她得站着读（反正那里没有椅子），而且她读的时候还得背对着门。于是她马上转身去关门。

但是这门关不上。

有些人可能觉得露西不该去关门，但我觉得她这么做是对的。她说，如果她能关上门，她就不会担心了，但要站在这样一个地方，还要背对着一扇敞开的门，心里就会发毛。要是我肯定也会有这种感觉。但是没有办法。

还有一件事让她伤透了脑筋，那就是这本书太大了。那个“头儿”没告诉她，那个让人现形的咒语在书里的哪个位置。她问起来的时候，他甚至感到非常惊讶。他想让她从头开始看，直到找到那个咒语为止。显然他从来没有想过用其他方法从书里找到这个咒语。“我可能得花上几天甚至几个礼拜才能找到！”露西看着那本巨大的书说，“我觉得我好像已经在这个地方待了好几个小时了。”

她走到书桌前，把手放在书上。她的手指刚碰到书就一阵刺痛，好像这本书带电似的。她用力去翻书，但是一开始打不开。不过，这仅仅是因为它被两个铅扣给扣住了，她一解开铅扣，书很容易就被打开了。这本书真是太奇怪了！

这本书是手写本，不是印刷本。书上字迹清晰，笔法匀称，向下的笔画厚重有力，向上的笔画轻描淡写。字体很大，比印刷的看起来更舒服。因为太好看了，露西盯着它看了整整一分钟，忘记读了。纸张又脆又滑，散发着一股香味。页边的空白处和每个咒语开头的彩色大写字母旁边，都配上了图片。

这本书没有扉页，也没有书名，开头就是咒语。前面的几条都无关紧要，有治疗疣子的（在月光下用银盆洗手），有治牙痛和抽筋的，还有一个捕捉蜂群的咒语。那个牙痛的人的图片是如此逼真，要是你盯着看的时候太长了，自己的牙齿也会疼起来。第四个咒语周围点缀着金色的蜜蜂，看起来就像是真的在飞。

露西看第一页看得入迷了，但是等她翻过一页，发现第二页也同样有趣。“但我必须得往下翻。”她告诉自己。她继续翻看了三十页左右，如果她记得住的话，就可以学会如何找到宝藏，如何记起忘记了的事情，如何忘记想忘记的事情，如何判断一个人是不是在说真话，如何召唤（或驱散）风、雾、雪、冰雹和雨，如何用魔法催眠和如何让人变笨。她读得越久，照片就越精彩，越逼真。

然后她翻到一页，那上面的图画如此绚丽，几乎叫人没法注意到上面的字。但她还是注意到了开头的那些话。这样写道：美貌超群绝伦灵方。露西把脸贴近那页纸，盯着上面的图画。那些图画原本看起来拥挤不堪，模糊不清，但是她发现她现在可以看得很清楚了。第一张图是一个女孩站在书桌前读着一本巨大的书。那个女孩穿得和露西一模一样。在下一张图里，露西（图画中的女孩就是露西自己）站着，张着嘴吟诵着什么，脸上的表情很可怕。在第三幅画中，那个获得了绝世美貌的女子向她走来。奇怪的是，原本这些图画都很小，但是图片里的露西现在看起来和真正的露西一样大了。她们互相对视了一会儿，真正的露西就把目光移开了，因为那个露西的美貌让她目眩神迷，不过她还是能在那张漂亮的脸上看到自己的影子。这会儿，所有的图画都朝她一窝蜂拥过来。她看见自己在卡罗门的比武大会上坐在高高的宝座之上，世界上所有的国王都为她的美貌而战。接着，比武大会变成了真的战争，纳尼亚、阿钦兰、台尔马、卡罗门、加尔马和泰瑞宾西亚都生灵涂炭，一片荒芜，这些国家的国王、公爵和贵族们都为赢得她的青睐而大打出手。然后画面突然变了，露西回到了英国，她仍旧是一个绝世美人。苏珊也从美国回来了，她曾经一直是家里最漂亮的一个。画中的苏珊看上去和真的苏珊完全一样，只是表情很难看。苏珊嫉妒露西令人目眩神迷的美貌，但这一点儿也不重要，因为现在没有人在乎苏珊了。

“我要念这句咒语，”露西说，“我不管。我一定要念。”她说她不管，是因为有一种强烈的感觉告诉她不能这么做。

但是，当她回去看咒语的开头时，发现原本只有字的地方出现了一张巨大的狮子脸，阿斯兰正凝视着她。画中的他金光闪闪，仿佛正从书页中向她走来。事实上，她也不确定他是不是真的没动。无论如何，她知道他脸上的表情是什么意思。他咆哮着，露出了锋利的牙齿。她害怕极了，马上翻过了那一页。

过了一会儿，她又看见了一个咒语，可以让人知道朋友对自己的看法。其实露西非常想试试刚才那个让人变得美艳绝伦的咒语。所以她觉得为了弥补刚刚没有念那条咒语，她一定要念这一条。她急急忙忙地念了咒语（我绝不会告诉你们咒语的内容），因为她怕自己又改变主意。然后她就等着看有什么事情发生。

结果什么也没发生，她就开始看这些图画。突然，她看到了她想都没想到过的画面——一辆火车的三等车厢里坐着两个女学生。她马上就认出了她们。她们是马乔里·普雷斯顿和安妮·费瑟斯通。不过这不仅仅是一幅画。画面在动。她能看到窗外的电线杆飞驰而过。然后她渐渐听到了她们的对话（就像打开了收音机一样）。

“这学期我可以经常和你待在一起吗？”安妮说，“还是说你还要继续和露西·佩文西一起鬼混。”

“你说鬼混是什么意思。”马乔里说。

“哦，你知道是什么意思，”安妮说，“上个学期你对她很上心呢。”

“不，我没有，”马乔里说，“我可没那么傻。她倒不是个坏孩子。但学期结束之前我对她就已经很厌倦了。”

“好吧，无论哪个学期你都再也不会有这个机会了！”露西喊道，“当面一套背后一套的坏蛋！”但她的声音让她马上意识到，她正在和一幅画说话，而真正的马乔里远在另一个世界。

“哼，”露西自言自语地说，“我之前不知道她这么坏。上个学期我为她做了各种各样的事情，在其他女孩不愿意和她一块儿的时候，我一直和她在一起。她也知道这一点。她却偏偏去找安妮·费瑟斯通！我不知道我的朋友们是不是都一个样？还有很多其他的图画。我不看了。我不看，我不看。”她努力地翻过那一页，但一大滴愤怒的眼泪猝不及防地落在了书页上。

在下一页她看到一个咒语，上面写着“用以提神”。这里的画更少，但很漂亮。露西发现自己读的更像是一个故事，而不是咒语。这个故事足足有三页，她还没读完这一页，就已经忘记自己在读书了。她沉浸在这个故事里，好像这是真的，所有的图画也仿佛都是真的。当她读到第三页故事结束的地方，她说道：“这是我读过的最可爱的故事。哦，我真希望我能一直读下去，读上个十年。至少我要再读一遍。”

但这时，这本书的一些魔法开始起作用了。这本书没法往回翻。右边的书页，也就是后边的书页可以往前翻动，但是左边的书页翻不动。

“啊呀，太可惜了！”露西说，“我好想再读一遍呀。好吧，至少我得把它记住。让我想想……这个故事写的是……是……天哪，这些东西又开始消失了。连最后一页都变成空白了。这本书真是太奇怪了。我怎么忘记了呢？这个故事里有一个杯子、一把剑、一棵树、一座青山，我只知道这么多了。但是我记不起来了，怎么办呀？”

她永远也记不起来了。从那以后，要是露西说一个故事是好故事，那这个故事一定是让她想起了她记不起来的这个魔法书里的故事。

她继续往下翻，惊奇地发现有一页根本没有图画，不过开头的字句倒写着：隐形事物现形法。她先看了一遍，把难认的字仔细确认了一遍，然后大声念了出来。她一念出来，就知道这咒语开始起作用了，因为她念的时候，书页顶部的大写字母就开始有颜色了，空白的地方也开始出现图画了。就像用隐形的墨水写字，然后放在火上烤，字就会渐渐出现。只是这不像柠檬汁（这是最原始的隐形墨水）那种暗黑色，而是纯金的、碧蓝的和鲜红的颜色。这些图画古怪得很，里面有许多人物的样子露西都不大喜欢。于是她心想：“我大概不只让那些隐身人现形了，应该是让所有的东西都现形了。这个地方一定有很多其他隐形的东西在晃来晃去呢。我还不确定是否想看到他们呢。”

就在这时，她听到身后一阵轻柔而有力的脚步声，沿着走廊传过来。当然，她还记得他们告诉她，魔法师光着脚，走起路来跟猫一样没有声音。转过身去总比有什么东西在你身后偷偷摸摸的好。露西转过了身。

接着她的脸上露出了笑容，一时间（当然她不知道），她看上去几乎和那个画里的露西一样美丽，她高兴得轻叫了一声，伸出胳膊向前跑去。原来门口站着的是狮王阿斯兰，他是所有至尊王中最至高无上的国王。他切切实实地在这里，身上温暖极了，他由着露西亲吻自己，把脸埋进他亮闪闪的鬃毛里。他的身体里发出低沉的地震般的声音，露西居然觉得他在咕噜咕噜地叫。

“啊，阿斯兰，”她说，“你来了，真是太好了。”

“我一直在这里，”他说，“只不过你让我现形了。”

“阿斯兰！”露西略带责备地说，“别开我玩笑了。好像我真能让你现形似的！”

“真的，”阿斯兰说，“你以为我不会遵守我自己定的规则吗？”

停顿了一会儿，他又说话了。

“孩子，”他说，“我想你刚刚一直在偷听。”

“偷听？”

“你偷听了你那两个同学关于你的对话。”

“哦，那个呀？我从没想过那是偷听，阿斯兰。那不是魔法吗？”

“用魔法监视别人，就像用其他办法监视别人一样。你错看了你的朋友。她很软弱，但是她爱你。她害怕那个大一些的女孩子，所以才说了违心的话。”

“我觉得我忘不掉我听到的她说的话。”

“不，不会的。”

“哦，天哪，”露西说，“我把一切都搞砸了吗？你的意思是，如果我没偷听，我们就会一直是朋友——而且是真正的好朋友，也许我们一辈子都是朋友——但现在这已经不可能了。”

“孩子，”阿斯兰说，“我以前难道没有跟你说过吗？谁也无法知道未来会发生什么事。”

“阿斯兰，你跟我说过，”露西说，“对不起。但是，请你……”

“亲爱的，继续说。”

“我还能再读一遍那个故事吗，那个我记不住的故事？你能给我讲一遍吗，阿斯兰？哦，讲嘛，讲嘛，讲嘛。”

“好，我会给你讲很多很多年。但是现在，过来吧。我们得去见见这座房子的主人。”





第十一章　欢天喜地笨蛋瓜


露西跟着狮子出去，来到走廊上，她看见一个穿着红色长袍的老人，赤着脚朝他们走来。他的白发上戴着橡树叶编成的花冠，胡须垂到了腰带，拄着一根雕工奇妙的手杖。他看见阿斯兰就深深地鞠了一躬，说：“欢迎您光临寒舍。”

“柯瑞金，我让你在这里管这些愚蠢的东西，你感到厌烦了吗？”

“不，”魔法师说，“他们确实很笨，但是不会做出什么有害的事情。我倒开始有点儿喜欢这些怪物了。我一直等着有一天能用智慧，而不是这种粗暴的魔法来管他们，可能我有时候等得有点儿不耐烦了。”

“柯瑞金，慢慢来。”阿斯兰说。

“是，慢慢来，”他回答说，“您打算在他们面前露露面吗？”

“不，”狮子轻吼道，（露西想）这大概和笑是一个意思吧，“我会把他们吓坏的。就是等到星星都老了，在岛上退休了，他们也还没有厉害到能接受这样的场面呢。今天日落之前，我必须去拜访矮人杜鲁普金，他正坐在凯尔帕拉维尔的城堡里数着他的主人凯斯宾回家的日子。露西，我要把你们的经历都告诉他。别这么伤心。我们不久就会见面的。”

“阿斯兰，求你了，”露西说，“不久是多久？”

阿斯兰说：“不管多长时间，我都说不久。”接着他马上消失了，剩下露西和那个魔法师在一起。

“他走了！”他说，“你我一样沮丧。一直都是这样，你留不住他，他不像是头温驯的狮子。你觉得我的书怎么样？”

“其中有些部分很不错，”露西说，“你一直都知道我在那里吗？”

“嗯，我当然知道，我让那些笨蛋变成隐身人的时候，就知道你不久就会来破解咒语。不过我不确定你哪天会来。今天早晨我也没有特意留心。你看，这咒语让我也隐形了，隐形之后我总是昏昏欲睡。嗨——呵——我又在打哈欠了。你饿吗？”

“嗯，好像有点儿，”露西说，“我不知道现在几点了。”

“来，”魔法师说，“对阿斯兰来说，多长时间都算是不久。而在我家，只要肚子饿了，就算一点钟。”

他带着她沿着走廊走了一小段路，打开了一扇门。进门以后，露西发现自己在一间满是阳光和鲜花的房间里。他们进来时桌子上面是空的，但那肯定是一张有魔法的桌子，老人念了一句咒语，桌布、银器、餐盘、杯子和食物就都出现了。

“希望你喜欢吃这些东西，”他说，“我尽量给你弄了些你家乡的食物，而不是你最近吃到的那些。”

“好可爱啊。”露西说。确实如此：一个热腾腾的煎蛋卷、冷羊肉、青豆、一个草莓冰淇淋、佐餐柠檬水，还有一杯巧克力。但是魔法师自己只喝葡萄酒，只吃面包。他没什么让人害怕的，露西和他很快就像老朋友一样聊起天来。

“这个咒语什么时候开始起作用？”露西问，“他们马上就能现形了吗？”

“是啊，他们现在都已经现形了。但他们可能都睡着了，他们中午总要休息一下。”

“现在他们已经现形了，你还要让他们继续丑陋下去吗？你能把他们变回以前的样子吗？”

“嗯，这是个相当微妙的问题，”魔法师说，“你知道吗，只有他们自己觉得自己原来长得很好看。他们说自己被变丑了，我可不这么觉得。许多人可能会说他们变得好看多了。”

“他们很自负吗？”

“是的。或者说只有笨蛋头头是这样，而且他把剩下的人也带坏了。他们总是相信他说的每一个字。”

“我们也注意到了。”露西说。

“是的，从某种程度上说，没有他我们会过得更好。我当然可以把他变成别的东西，甚至可以对他们施咒，让他们不相信他说的话。但我不喜欢那样做。对他们来说，崇拜他总比不崇拜任何人来得好。”

“他们不崇拜你？”露西问。

“哦，不，”魔法师说，“他们不崇拜我。”

“你为什么要把他们变丑——我是说，他们所谓的变丑？”

“好吧，他们不听话。他们的工作是照看花园和栽培食物——他们以为那些都是为我做的，但其实都是为了他们自己。如果我不逼他们做，他们根本不会去做。当然，要打理花园就需要水。在半英里之外的山上有一汪美丽的清泉。一条小溪从泉水中流出来，正好穿过花园。我只是让他们用这小溪里的水，没有让他们一天两三次地提着水桶去打泉水。要是这样长途跋涉，他们恐怕该累坏了，水也会洒出来一半。但他们不明白。最后他们断然拒绝了我。”

“他们愚蠢到了这种地步吗？”露西问。

魔法师叹了口气：“他们给我带来的麻烦，说了你也不信。几个月前，他们都是在晚饭前把盘子和刀子洗干净，他们说这样可以节省时间，免得吃了饭再洗。我还碰到过他们在种煮熟的土豆，说是免得挖起来之后再煮。有一天，猫钻进了牛奶房，他们出动了二十个人把所有的牛奶往外搬，没人想到去把猫赶出来。我看你吃好了。既然那些笨蛋现在已经现形了，我们就去看看他们现在的模样吧。”

他们走进另一个房间，里面都是些擦得铮亮、让人摸不着头脑的仪器，如星盘、太阳系仪、计时器、诗行表、诗律表和经纬仪。他们来到窗口时，魔法师说：“在那儿。你要看的笨蛋在那儿。”

“我没看见任何人，”露西说，“那些蘑菇一样的是什么东西？”

她指的这些东西到处都是，铺满了草地。它们的确很像蘑菇，但又太大了——蘑菇柄大约有三英尺高，蘑菇盖的直径差不多也是三英尺。她仔细一看，发现蘑菇柄不连在蘑菇盖中间，而是连在了一侧，看上去不太对称。而且每个蘑菇柄根部都好像有什么东西，像个小包裹似的躺在草地上。其实，她越看这些东西越不像蘑菇。蘑菇盖也不像她之前以为的那么圆。直里比横里长，一头比另一头宽。个数很多，可能有五十多个。

钟敲了三下。

一件离奇的事情发生了。每个“蘑菇”都突然一下子颠倒了过来。那些蘑菇柄下面的小包裹原来是头和身体。蘑菇柄就是腿。但每个身子并不是长着两条腿，而只有一条粗短的腿（不像只有一条腿的人那样长在一边），腿下面长着一只巨大的脚——脚趾很宽，微微向上翘起，看起来就像一艘小独木舟。这下，她马上就明白了为什么他们看起来像蘑菇。他们平躺在地上，那条腿朝空中伸直，巨大的脚丫被撑在半空。后来她才知道，这是他们平常的休息方式。因为这只脚可以遮雨遮阳，独脚怪躺在自己的脚下就像躺在帐篷里一样。

“啊呀，好有趣，好有趣，”露西大笑道，“是你把他们变成这样的吗？”

“对，是的，我把那些笨蛋变成了独脚怪。”魔法师说。他也在大笑，笑得眼泪都出来了。“但是你看。”他补充道。

这值得一看。当然，这些独脚怪不能像我们这样走路或奔跑。他们走路全靠跳，就像跳蚤和青蛙那样。你看他们跳得多好啊，每只大脚都像一个弹簧。露西昨天听到的莫名其妙的砰砰声，其实就是他们蹦蹦跳跳发出来的声音。

现在他们正往四面八方跳，互相喊着：“嘿，伙计们！我们现形啦。”

“我们现形了，”一个戴着红色流苏帽子的人说，他显然是独脚怪的头儿，“我想说的是，伙计们都现形了，我们才能看到彼此。”

“啊，就是，就是，头儿，”其他的人都叫道，“说得太对了，你真是头脑最清醒的人了。你真是说到点子上了。”

“那个小女孩趁着魔法师措手不及成功了，”独脚怪的头儿说，“这次我们打败了他。”

“我们也正想这么说呢，”其他的人齐声说道，“头儿，你今天比以往更强了。继续说，继续说。”

“他们竟然敢这样说你？”露西说，“昨天他们好像还很怕你。难道他们不知道你有可能在听吗？”

“这就是这些笨蛋的有趣之处，”魔法师说，“一会儿把我说得好像掌控一切，什么都听得到，是一个很危险的人。一会儿又觉得可以用他们的雕虫小技骗过我——我的老天！”

“他们必须得变回原来的样子吗？”露西问道，“啊呀，如果让他们维持这个样子，不会显得很无情吧。他们真的很介意吗？他们看起来很开心。我是说，看他们跳来跳去的样子。他们以前是什么样子？”

“普通的矮人，”他说，“离你们纳尼亚的矮人可差远了。”

“把他们变回原样真的太可惜了，”露西说，“他们这么有趣，而且也挺好看的。如果我跟他们说了，你觉得会有什么影响吗？”

“我觉得肯定会有——如果你能让他们听进去。”

“你愿意和我一起去试试吗？”

“不，不。我不在你会顺利得多。”

“非常感谢你的午餐。”露西说着，迅速转过身去。她跑下楼梯，那天早晨她爬上这个楼梯时还紧张得要命。没料到她在楼梯下撞到了艾德蒙。所有的人都陪着他在那儿等着，露西看到他们焦急的脸，意识到自己已经把他们忘到了脑后，心里就感到一阵歉疚。

“没事了，”她喊道，“一切都好了。魔法师是个大好人，我还看见了阿斯兰。”

说完，她像一阵风似的从他们身边跑进了花园。这里的空气中回响着独脚怪的叫喊声，地面被跳得直震动。他们看见她的时候，气氛更加热烈了。

“她来了，她来了，”他们喊道，“让我们一起为她欢呼。啊！她骗过了那个老头儿，她成功了。”

“我们非常遗憾，”独脚怪的头儿说，“我们不能让你看看我们被丑化之前的样子，因为你不会相信这样的差别，这是事实，因为我们现在真是太丑了，所以我们不会欺骗你。”

“啊，说得对，头儿，说得对，”其他人附和着，像许多玩具气球一样弹跳着，“你说得太对了，你说得太对了。”

“可我觉得你们一点儿也不丑，”露西大声喊道，努力让大家都听见她说的话，“我觉得你们挺好看的。”

“听她说，听她说，”独脚怪们说，“小姐，你说得对。我们很好看。没有更好看的人了。”他们毫不惊奇地说了这话，似乎没有注意到他们改变了主意。

“她是在说，”独脚怪的头儿说，“在我们变丑之前，我们是多么好看。”

“头儿，你说得对，你说得对，”其他人又开始喊叫，“她也是这么说的。我们也亲耳听到了。”

“我没有，”露西大声叫道，“我说你们现在很好看。”

“她是这么说的，”独脚怪的头儿说，“她说我们以前很好看。”

“他们俩说得都对，他们俩说得都对，”独脚怪们说，“你们俩说到一块儿去了。你们说的总是对的。他们说得太好了。”

“可我们说的意思恰恰相反。”露西不耐烦地跺着脚说。

“是啊，当然，是这样的，”独脚怪们说，“一点儿也不相反。你们两个都继续说。”

“你们真是要把人逼疯了。”露西说，干脆放弃了跟他们争论。但是独脚怪们似乎都很满足。她想，总体上来说，这次对话还算成功。

那天晚上大家睡觉前又发生了一件事，让独脚怪们对自己只有一只脚的状况更加满意了。凯斯宾和所有的纳尼亚人都尽快回到了岸边，告诉莱斯和黎明踏浪号上的其他人发生了什么事，那会儿他们都已经担心坏了。当然，独脚怪们也一起去了，他们像足球似的蹦蹦跳跳，一路上还在不断地大声赞同彼此说的话，直到尤斯塔斯说：“我希望魔法师能让他们静音，而不是隐形。”（他很快就对他说的话感到后悔了。因为他要跟他们解释静音的意思就是听不见声音。虽然他费了好大的力气，还是不确定那些独脚怪有没有听懂。最让他生气的是，他们最后还说：“啊，他不能像头儿一样把事情说明白。但是年轻人，你会知道的。听听我们头儿说话吧。他会让你知道该怎么说话。他就是你该学习的榜样！”）他们来到海湾的时候，雷佩契普想到了一个绝妙的主意。他把自己的小船放到了水里，坐在里面划桨，独脚怪们看得很感兴趣。然后，他站了起来，说：“尊敬而机智的独脚先生们，你们不需要船。你们只需要用你们的脚就可以了。你们要尽量轻轻地在水面上跳，看看会发生什么。”

独脚怪的头儿踌躇不前，警告其他人他们会发现水是湿漉漉的。但有一两个年轻人几乎立马就去试了。接着，又有几个人效仿他们，最后所有人都去了。他们都在水面上跳了起来。独脚怪的单脚可以当作天然的筏或船。雷佩契普教他们如何为自己砍一根粗糙的木桨，他们学会了之后就在海湾和黎明踏浪号周围划来划去，就像一支小船队，每艘小船的一端都站着一个胖胖的矮人。他们举行了比赛，大船上放下来一瓶瓶酒给他们做奖品。水手们靠在两侧船舷看着，笑得肚子都疼了。

这些笨蛋对他们的新名字“独脚怪”也很满意，这在他们看来是个厉害的名字，尽管他们压根读不准这个名字。“这个名字说的就是我们，”他们吼道，“笃脚乖，脚怪独，怪独脚。我们称呼自己的叫法就在舌尖上。”但是他们很快就把它和他们的旧名字混淆了，最后决定把自己叫作“笨蛋瓜”，这个名字可能会用上几个世纪。

那天晚上，所有的纳尼亚人都和魔法师一起在楼上用餐，露西注意到，她现在不再害怕了，整个顶楼看上去就不一样了。门上的符号仍旧很神秘，但现在看来，它们似乎能让人感觉到友好和愉快，甚至连那面长胡子的镜子也显得很滑稽，变得一点儿也不可怕了。晚餐时，每个人都靠魔法吃到了自己喜欢的食物和饮料。晚饭后，魔法师施了一个实用而精彩的魔法。他在桌子上放了两张空白的羊皮纸，要求德里宁准确地叙述他们目前为止的所有航程。德里宁一边说，纸上就一边线条清晰地出现他描述的内容。最后两张纸都变成了一幅壮丽的东海地图，标示出了加尔马、泰瑞宾西亚、七岛、孤独群岛、龙岛、焦岛、死水岛，还有笨蛋们的地方，大小和位置都完全正确。它们是那些海域有史以来的第一批地图，比那些此后不施魔法做出来的好多了。在这些地图上，虽然城镇和山乍看和普通地图上的没什么不同，但是魔法师借给他们一个放大镜之后，他们就看到，这上面完完全全是真实原物的微缩景观，虽然很远，但是可以清楚地看到狭港的城堡、奴隶市场和街道，就像透过望远镜看过去似的。唯一的缺点是大部分岛屿的海岸线都是不完整的，因为地图只显示了德里宁亲眼所见的东西。地图制作完成后，魔法师自己保留了一幅，把另一幅送给了凯斯宾。这幅地图现在还挂在他凯尔帕拉维尔的仪器馆里。但是，魔法师也没法告诉他们再往东去的海洋和陆地是什么情况。不过，他告诉他们，大约七年前，一艘纳尼亚的船在这里停靠，雷维廉勋爵、阿尔格兹勋爵、马夫拉蒙勋爵和罗普勋爵都在船上。因此他们推断，他们看到的躺在死水里的金人一定是雷斯蒂玛勋爵。

第二天，魔法师用魔法修补了黎明踏浪号被海蛇破坏的船尾，还在船上装满了实用的礼物。分别时，大家都友好极了，下午两点出发时，所有的笨蛋瓜都跟着黎明踏浪号划到了港口，欢呼不断，直到船上的人听不见他们的声音。





第十二章　黑暗岛


经过这番冒险，他们乘着柔和的微风，往南偏东的方向航行了十二天。天空大多时候是晴朗的，空气温暖，看不见鸟或鱼，只有一次，有一条鲸鱼在右舷侧的远处喷水。这段时间，露西和雷佩契普下了很多回棋。到了第十三天，艾德蒙在桅顶观测台看到了左舷船头的海面上有一块黑压压的大山似的东西。

他们改变航向，往这片陆地驶去，主要是靠划桨，因为风力不足，不能向东北行驶。夜幕降临时，离那里还有很长一段路，于是他们划了整整一夜。第二天早上，天空很晴朗，但是海面上十分平静。那块黑压压的东西就在前面，虽然离他们近了很多，看起来大了很多，但还是模模糊糊的。有些人以为它还很远，有些人却觉得他们进入了一团迷雾。

大约在那天上午九点钟左右，突然一下子，他们隔得很近才发现那根本不是一块陆地，甚至不是一团普通的雾。那是一片黑暗。这很难描述，但是如果你想象自己正看着一个铁路隧道的入口——这条隧道要么是太长了，要么是太曲折了，所以你看不见远处尽头的光线，你就会明白它是什么样子了。过隧道是什么样你应该知道。刚刚你还在几英尺外看到光天化日之下的铁轨、枕木和碎石，不一会儿就到了一个光线昏暗的地方。然后，突然之间，也没有一条明显的分界线，这一切就在无边的黑暗之中消失得无影无踪。这里也一样。在船头前几英尺的地方，他们还看得见碧绿的海水。再往前一点儿的地方，水面是灰白色的，就像傍晚时的样子。但是，再前面就是彻底的黑暗了，仿佛无月无星的黑夜。

凯斯宾大声命令水手长把船往后划。这时，除了那些划桨的人外，所有人都冲向船头往前望去。但是他们什么也看不到。他们身后是大海和太阳，前面是黑暗。

“我们要进去吗？”凯斯宾终于问道。

“我不建议这么做。”德里宁说。

“船长说得对。”几个水手说。

“我觉得他是对的。”艾德蒙说。

露西和尤斯塔斯虽然没有说话，不过在事情似乎就要做出决定的紧要时刻，他们心里很高兴。但突然，雷佩契普清晰的声音打破了沉默。

“为什么不进去？”他说，“有人能跟我解释为什么吗？”

没有人急于解释，于是雷佩契普继续说：“如果这话是农民或奴隶说出来的，我可能会认为这个建议是出于怯懦。但我希望在纳尼亚永远不要有这样的传说，一群正值大好年纪的王公贵族因为害怕黑暗而退缩了。”

“但是穿过那片黑暗有什么用处呢？”德里宁问。

“用处？”雷佩契普说，“船长，用处？如果你的意思是填满我们的肚皮或钱包，我承认这根本没用。据我所知，我们启航不是为了去寻找有用的东西，而是寻求荣誉和冒险。眼下就是我听说过的最伟大的一次冒险，如果我们在这里回头，我们的荣誉就要受损。”

几个水手压低嗓门，听起来像是在说“荣誉个鬼”，但凯斯宾说：“啊呀，雷佩契普，你真是麻烦。我倒有点儿希望我们当时把你留在家里了。好吧！既然你都这么说了，我想我们只好继续往前了。除非露西不愿意去？”

露西其实心里很不情愿，但是她大声说：“我愿意去。”

“陛下至少会下令点灯吧？”德里宁说。

“当然。”凯斯宾说，“千万要点灯，船长。”

于是，船尾、船头和桅顶上的三盏灯都亮了，德里宁在船的中部点了两个火把。这些灯火在阳光下看起来黯淡无光。接着，除了那些被留在下面划桨的人，所有的人都奉命到了甲板上，全副武装，拔出剑守在战斗岗位上。露西和两个弓箭手被派到桅顶观测台上，他们都把箭上弦，把弓拉满。莱斯站在船头，拿着测绳准备测水深。雷佩契普、艾德蒙、尤斯塔斯和凯斯宾穿着盔甲和他在一起，身上闪闪发光。德里宁掌着舵。

“现在，以阿斯兰的名义，前进！”凯斯宾喊道，“把桨划得慢一点儿、稳一点儿。每个人都安静别出声，听候命令。”

随着船员们开始划桨，黎明踏浪号嘎吱一声，开始缓慢前进。露西站在桅顶观测台上，在船开进黑暗的那一刻看到了奇妙的景象。船尾还沐浴在阳光下，船头已经不见了。她看着船消失在黑暗中。刚刚那镀金的船尾、蔚蓝色的大海和天空都还在光天化日之下，眨眼间海面和天空就都消失了。船尾的灯原本毫不起眼，这会儿却成了唯一能指示船尾的标记。她能看到德里宁在灯前伏着身子掌舵的黑影。在她下面，那两个火把在甲板上照亮了两小块亮处，火光在剑和头盔上闪烁，前面的船头上还有一片亮光。另外，她上方的桅顶灯照亮了观测台，看上去像是一小方明亮的世界，孤独地在黑暗中漂浮着。而灯光则阴森森的，很不自然，就像白天不该点灯的时候必须得点灯一样。她还发现自己很冷。

谁也不知道他们到底在黑暗中航行了多久。只有桨架嘎吱嘎吱的声音和桨哗啦哗啦的划水声能证明船在移动。艾德蒙从船头张望，除了他前面水面上灯光的倒影，什么也看不见。这灯光的倒影看上去黏糊糊的，船头激起的波纹看上去又重又小，毫无生气。随着时间的流逝，除了划桨的人，所有的人都冷得发抖。

突然，不知从什么地方——这会儿已经没有人还分得清方向了——传来了一声喊叫，那声音听起来不像人的声音，或者是因为太害怕变得不像人的声音了。

凯斯宾的嘴巴太干了，但是他还是努力地想说话，这时只听到雷佩契普那尖利的声音，在那片寂静中听起来格外响亮。

“谁在叫？”他尖声说，“如果你是我们的敌人，我们不会怕你；如果你是我们的朋友，这就让你的敌人尝尝我们的厉害。”

“行行好！”那声音叫道，“行行好！即使只是一个梦，也行行好吧。让我上船吧。带我走吧，就算你们把我打死也行。但是，行行好吧，不要再消失了，不要再把我留在这可怕的地方。”

“你在哪里？”凯斯宾大声喊道，“上船吧，欢迎你。”

又传来了一声叫喊，不知道是出于高兴还是害怕，于是他们知道有人正向他们游来。

“伙计们，准备把他拉起来。”凯斯宾说。

“是，是，陛下。”水手们说。几个人拿着缆绳挤在左舷舷墙边，还有一个人身体探出船侧，手里拿着火把。一张粗野的惨白的脸从漆黑的水里露了出来，接着，十几只善意的手经过一番拉扯把这个陌生人拉到了船上。

艾德蒙觉得从来没有见过长相这么粗野的人。虽然他看上去不太老，但他的头发却乱糟糟的，白白的一团，他的脸瘦削而憔悴，他的衣服只是一些湿漉漉的破布。但是，最容易注意到的是他的眼睛，张得老大，看起来像没有眼皮似的，眼神直勾勾的，好像被吓得非常痛苦。他的脚一踏上甲板，就说：“飞啊！飞啊！乘着船飞啊！划啊，划啊，想活命就赶紧划啊，离开这该死的海岸！”

“冷静一下，”雷佩契普说，“告诉我们有什么危险。我们一般都不飞。”

那个陌生人之前没注意到这儿有只老鼠，一听到老鼠的声音吓坏了。

“尽管如此，你还是得从这里飞走。”他气喘吁吁地说，“这是一个让人的梦成真的岛。”

“这是我很久以来一直在找的那个岛，”一个水手说，“我想如果我们在这里上岸，我就会发现我和南希结婚了。”

“我会发现汤姆又活了。”另一个说。

“傻瓜！”那人怒气冲冲地跺着脚说，“我就是听说了这些才会来到这里，结果我宁可淹死，或者最好压根就没出生。你们听见我说什么了吗？明白吗，在这里，梦会变成真的，会变成现实。不是白日梦，是梦。”

大伙沉默了半分钟，接着，只听见盔甲咣锵咣锵，全体船员迅速地从主舱口滚下来，急匆匆地开始划桨，好像他们从来没有划过桨似的。德里宁把舵柄来了个大转弯，水手长把桨划得奇快无比。因为在那半分钟里，每个人都回想起了他们曾经做过的梦——那些梦把人吓得不敢再次入睡——他们意识到如果在一个梦会成真的地方登陆，后果将不堪设想。

只有雷佩契普仍无动于衷。

“陛下，陛下，”他说，“您打算容忍这种反抗您的旨意临阵脱逃的行为吗？这是恐慌，这是溃败！”

“划，划，”凯斯宾吼道，“拼命划。德里宁，船头没问题吧？雷佩契普，随你怎么说。有些事是没有人能对付得了的。”

“那么，还好我不是一个人。”雷佩契普生硬地鞠了一躬说。

露西在高处听到了这一切。一瞬间，她想起了曾经极力想忘掉的一个梦，鲜活得仿佛她刚刚从那个梦中醒来。原来在他们身后，在那个岛上，黑暗中竟是那么回事！那一刻，她想下楼到甲板上去，跟艾德蒙和凯斯宾在一起。但是有什么用呢？如果梦开始成真，她一到他们那里，艾德蒙和凯斯宾自己也可能变成可怕的怪物。她紧紧抓住观测台的栏杆，努力稳住自己。他们正拼命地划回有光的地方，一会儿就没事了。哎呀，但愿现在就没事了！

虽然划桨发出了很大的声响，但船只周围仍然是一片寂静。大家都知道，最好不要去听，不要竖起耳朵听这片黑暗中的任何声音。但是大家都忍不住去听。很快每个人都听到了动静。每个人听到的声音都不同。

“你听见那里有一个声音像……像一把巨大的剪刀在咔嚓咔嚓响吗？”尤斯塔斯问莱斯。

“嘘！”莱斯说，“我听见它们爬上了舷侧。”

“它们就像要停在桅杆上了。”凯斯宾说。

“哎！”一个水手说，“开始敲锣了。我就知道他们会敲锣。”

凯斯宾尽量不去看任何东西，尤其是不回头看身后的东西，他径直往船尾德里宁那里走去。

“德里宁，”他低声说，“我们进来时划了多久？我的意思是到我们救起那个陌生人的地方为止。”

“大概五分钟，”德里宁悄悄地说，“怎么了？”

“我们往外划了不止五分钟了。”

德里宁的手在舵柄上颤抖，一股冷汗从他脸上流下来。船上的每个人都开始这么想。“我们出不去了，我们出不去了，”划桨的人呜咽道，“他转错了方向。我们一直在原地打转。我们再也出不去了。”那个陌生人原本一直蜷缩成一团躺在甲板上，这下他突然坐起来，发出恐怖的尖声大笑。

“永远出不去了！”他大声喊道，“没错。当然啦。我们永远也逃不出去了。我真傻，以为他们会就这么轻易地放我走。不，不，我们永远也出不去了。”

露西把头靠在桅顶观测台的边缘，悄悄地说：“阿斯兰，阿斯兰，你要是爱我们，就帮帮我们吧。”那片黑暗没有丝毫变化，不过她开始感觉好了一点儿，尽管只是很少很少的一点儿。“毕竟，我们还没有真的出什么事呢。”她想。

“看！”莱斯在船头嘶哑地嚷道。前面有一小点儿光，接着他们看见一大束光照到了船身上。周围仍旧是一片漆黑，但是整艘船就像被探照灯照亮了似的。凯斯宾眨了眨眼睛，凝视四周，只见同伴们的脸上都带着狂热而专注的表情。每个人都盯着同一个方向：大家身后都有一个轮廓分明的影子。

露西顺着光束看去，立刻看到光束里面有什么东西。起初，它看起来像个十字架，接着看起来像一架飞机，然后看起来像一个风筝，最后，它的翅膀在头顶呼呼作响，原来是一只信天翁。它绕着桅杆飞了三圈，然后停在船头的镀金龙头上休息了片刻。它发出一串响亮悦耳的声音，好像在说什么话，但没人听得懂。然后，它展开翅膀飞了起来，在前面偏向右舷慢慢地飞行。德里宁把它认作一个好向导，便跟着它飞行的方向掌舵。但除了露西以外，谁也不知道它绕着桅杆盘旋时悄声对她说：“亲爱的，勇敢一些。”她确信那就是阿斯兰的声音，它说话间还有一股香味朝她扑面而来。

不一会儿，前方的那片黑暗变成了一片灰暗，他们还不敢有所期待，就忽而发现已经到了阳光下，回到了温暖的蓝色世界中。一下子，大家都意识到再也不用害怕了，其实也没有发生什么可怕的事情。他们眨了眨眼睛，环顾四周。船身明亮的颜色让他们大吃一惊：他们原先以为那片黑暗会附在白色、绿色和金色的地方，留下一些尘垢或浮渣。然后他们一个接一个地笑了。

“我想我们就像一群傻瓜。”莱斯说。

露西飞快地来到甲板上，发现大家都围着那个陌生人。他高兴得久久说不出话来，只能望着大海和太阳，摸着舷墙和绳子，好像在确认自己真的醒了，眼泪顺着他的面颊簌簌地滚落下来。

“谢谢你们，”他终于说，“你们把我救出了……还是不说那些事了。你们是谁？我是纳尼亚的台尔马人，当年我还有些身价时别人叫我罗普勋爵。”

“我，”凯斯宾说，“我是纳尼亚的国王凯斯宾，我此行就是为了寻找你和你的同伴，你们都是我父亲的朋友。”

罗普勋爵跪下来，吻了吻国王的手。“陛下，”他说，“您是这个世界上我最想见到的人。恳请陛下赐恩。”

“什么事？”凯斯宾问道。

“别把我带回这个地方。”他指着船尾的方向说。大伙都往那里看，但是只看到了碧蓝的大海和明亮的蓝天。黑暗岛和那里的黑暗已经永远地消失了。

“怎么会这样！”罗普勋爵叫道，“你们让黑暗消失了！”

“我觉得不是因为我们。”露西说。

“陛下，”德里宁说，“现在这会儿的风是往东南方向吹的。要不要我叫我们可怜的伙伴们开船启航？启航之后，有空的人都去吊床上睡觉吧。”

“好，”凯斯宾说，“还有，让大家痛快地喝酒吧。嗨哟，我觉得我能整整睡上一天一夜呢。”

于是整个下午他们都顺着风往东南方向航行，大家都兴高采烈的。但是谁也没有注意到那只信天翁是什么时候消失的。





第十三章　三个沉睡的人


风一刻也没有停过，但是一天比一天小，最后所谓浪花不过是海面上荡起的涟漪而已。船一直在滑行，就像行驶在平静的湖面上似的。每天晚上，他们都看见新的星辰在东方升起，没人在纳尼亚见到过这样的星星。也许，就像露西想的那样，任何人的肉眼都根本没见过吧，这让她既高兴又害怕。那些新的星星又大又明亮，夜晚也很温暖。他们大多数人都睡在甲板上，一直聊到深夜，或是在船舷望着船头激起的泡沫翩然起舞。

一天傍晚，景色美得不可思议，夕阳显出绯红带紫的颜色，晚霞把天空渲染得更加广阔。右舷的船头那边出现了一块陆地。它越来越近，他们身后的余晖映得这个新地方的岬角看起来像着火了似的。不一会儿，他们就沿着这块陆地的海岸航行了，西面的岬角在他们身后慢慢升起，黑色轮廓衬着红色的天空，轮廓分明，仿佛硬纸板剪影一般。这时，他们才看清这地方是什么样子。这里没有山，只有许多不是很陡的小山，山坡像枕头一样。陆地上传来一种诱人的气味，露西说是“一股隐隐约约的紫色气味”，艾德蒙说她是在瞎扯（莱斯也这么觉得），但凯斯宾说：“我懂你的意思。”

他们的船开了很久，经过一个又一个小岬角。他们盼着能找到一个深水港，但最后只能找了一个又宽又浅的海湾将就一下。虽然外边的海面上平静得很，但是到了岸边，难免有海浪拍打着沙滩，他们没能按照他们的想法把黎明踏浪号开进很里面的地方。他们没法子，只能在离海滩还有好一段路的地方抛了锚，然后划着小船，跌跌撞撞地上了岸，弄得浑身湿漉漉的。罗普勋爵留在黎明踏浪号上。他希望再也不要见到岛屿。他们在岛上的时候，海浪声一直不绝于耳。

有两个人被留下来看守小船，凯斯宾带着其他人往里面走，但是他们没走多远，因为时间已经晚了，马上就要天黑了，来不及继续探索。不过他们也没必要冒险走得太远。滩头有一处平地，上面没有路，也没有足迹，看不出有人居住的迹象。他们的脚下是茂盛而坚韧的草地，到处点缀着一种低矮的灌木，艾德蒙和露西觉得是欧石南。尤斯塔斯对植物学颇有些了解，他说这不是欧石南，也许他说对了，不过这种灌木和欧石南很相似。

他们走到离海岸一箭之遥的地方，德里宁说：“看！那是什么？”大家都停住了脚步。

“是大树吗？”凯斯宾说。

“我觉得是塔。”尤斯塔斯说。

“也可能是巨人。”艾德蒙低声说。

“要知道是什么就得进去看看。”雷佩契普说着就拔出了剑，气势汹汹地走在大伙前面。

“我觉得是个废墟。”他们走得更近时，露西说。目前为止她是猜得最接近的一个了。他们看到了一个宽阔的长方形空间，地上铺着光滑的石头，周围是灰色的柱子，但没有屋顶。一张长长的桌子从一端延伸到了另一端，上面铺着一块深红色的桌布，几乎垂到了石板地面上。桌子两边放着许多把石椅，雕刻得精致华美，铺着丝质的坐垫。餐桌上摆放着一桌从未见过的美味佳肴，即使是至尊王彼得在凯尔帕拉维尔执政时也没出现过这样的宴席。有火鸡、鹅和孔雀，有野猪头和鹿肉。有各种各样的馅饼，有的形状像满帆的船，有的像龙，有的像大象。有冰布丁，有颜色鲜艳的龙虾，有亮闪闪的三文鱼，有坚果、葡萄、菠萝、桃子、石榴、甜瓜和西红柿。还有金酒壶、银酒壶和精巧的玻璃酒杯。果实和美酒的香味就像快乐的祝福一样向他们迎面扑来。

“哇！”露西说。

他们越走越近，大家都安静地不出声。

“可是客人在哪儿呢？”尤斯塔斯问道。

“先生，我们倒是愿意当客人。”莱斯说。

“看！”艾德蒙厉声喊道。他们正站在柱子中间的石板地面上。大家都看向艾德蒙指的地方。椅子上好像有东西。在桌子的一端和旁边的两个座位上有什么东西，好像有三个呢。

“那些是什么？”露西轻声问道，“看起来像三只海狸坐在那儿。”

“也可能是一个大鸟巢。”艾德蒙说。

“我看更像一个干草堆。”凯斯宾说。

雷佩契普跑上前，跳到椅子上，又从那里跳到桌子上，沿着桌面继续往前跑，像个舞者一样敏捷地在镶着宝石的杯子、堆得像塔一般高的水果和象牙盐瓶之间穿行。他径直跑到那团神秘的灰色物体前，看一看，摸一摸，接着叫道：“我看这些东西不会打架。”

这时，大家都走近一看，发现那三把椅子上坐着三个人。只有凑近了仔细看，才能认出他们来。他们的头发是灰色的，一直盖过眼睛，差不多把脸都遮住了。他们的胡子延伸到桌子上，四处攀爬，像荆棘似的缠绕着餐盘和酒杯，最后一大团毛发缠在一起，从桌子边缘往下拖到了地面。他们的头发一直挂到了椅背上，把他们整个都藏起来了。事实上，这三个人全身都布满了毛发。

“死了吗？”凯斯宾说。

“陛下，我觉得没死。”雷佩契普用两只爪子撩开乱糟糟的头发，举起他们其中一个人的一只手，“这只手是温热的，他的脉搏还在跳。”

“这只也是，还有这只。”德里宁说。

“哎呀，他们只是睡着了。”尤斯塔斯说。

“不过，睡了很长时间，”艾德蒙说，“才让头发都长成了这样。”

“他们这样睡觉想必是中了魔法，”露西说，“我们一走上这个岛，我就觉得这里充满了魔法。哦！你们觉不觉得我们到这里就是来打破魔咒的？”

“我们可以试试。”凯斯宾说，一面摇醒那三个睡着的人中离他最近的一个。一时间，大家都以为他就要成功了，因为那人深吸了一口气，嘟囔了一句：“我再也不往东走了。划船回纳尼亚去。”但是他立刻又陷入了更深的沉睡当中：他沉重的脑袋冲着桌子垂下来，无论怎么叫都叫不醒了。第二个人的情况也差不多。“我们不是注定要过动物一样的生活的。趁着还有机会去东方吧，到太阳后面的地方去。”说完他也不省人事了。第三个人只说了一句：“请给我芥末。”立马又酣睡过去。

“唉？划船回纳尼亚？”德里宁说。

“是啊，”凯斯宾说，“德里宁，你说得对。我想我们这次远寻要结束了。让我们来看看他们的戒指。对，这些就是他们的图章。这是雷维廉勋爵，这是阿尔格兹勋爵，这是马夫拉蒙勋爵。”

“但是我们叫不醒他们，”露西说，“我们该怎么办？”

“请陛下宽恕，”莱斯说，“但是为什么不一边讨论一边用餐呢？这样美味的晚餐可不是每天都有。”

“千万不能吃！”凯斯宾说。

“对，没错，”几个水手说，“这里到处都是魔法。我们还是尽快回船上比较好。”

“没错，”雷佩契普说，“这三位勋爵就是因为吃了这些食物才沉睡了七年之久。”

“为了保命，我还是不去碰这些食物了。”德里宁说。

“天马上就要黑了。”莱斯说。

“回船上吧，回船上吧。”一些人嘀咕道。

“我真心觉得，”艾德蒙说，“他们说得对。我们可以明天再决定拿这三个沉睡的人怎么办。我们不敢吃这些东西，在这里过夜没有意义。这里充满了魔法和危险的气味。”

“我完全赞同艾德蒙国王的意见，”雷佩契普说，“这是从船上全员的角度出发。但是就我自己来说，我要坐在这张桌子上直到太阳升起。”

“到底为什么？”尤斯塔斯说。

“因为，”老鼠说，“这是一次非常伟大的冒险，对我来说。要是我因为害怕留下一个未解的谜，就这样回到纳尼亚，这个问题可比面临危险要严重得多。”

“雷佩，我和你一起吧。”艾德蒙说。

“我也留下。”凯斯宾说。

“还有我。”露西也说道。接着尤斯塔斯也自告奋勇留了下来。对于他来说，这是非常勇敢的举动。因为在他登上黎明踏浪号之前，他从来没有读到过这样的事，甚至都没有听说过，所以他的处境比其他人更难了。

“我恳求陛下……”德里宁刚开口，就被凯斯宾打断了。“不，我的勋爵，”凯斯宾说，“你应该回到船上，我们五个人今天一直闲着，但是你已经劳累了一整天。”他们争论了许久，但是最后还是凯斯宾说了算。暮色渐浓，船员们向岸边行进，五个留下来的人中，除了雷佩契普，其他人都觉得胃里冷冰冰的。

他们花了好长时间在这张危险的桌子上挑座位。可能每个人都是出于同一个原因，不过没人说出来。因为这实在是个令人讨厌的选择。没有人能忍受一整夜都坐在那三个长毛怪旁边，就算他们没有死，照常理来说，也不是活的。另一方面，要是远远地坐在桌子的另一头，随着夜色越来越深，就越来越看不见他们，没法知道他们是不是有动静，也许在半夜两点钟就一点儿也看不见他们了。不，不该想这样的事。于是他们绕着桌子走了一圈又一圈，说着：“这儿怎么样？”或者说：“要不坐远一点儿。”或者“为什么不坐在这一边？”到最后，他们终于决定坐在中间，但是离那三个睡着的人比那头更近一些。差不多十点钟了，天几乎已经黑了。那些陌生的新星座在东方的天空中发光。如果这些星座是在纳尼亚的天空看到过的豹子、船或者其他老朋友，露西倒会更加喜欢。

他们把自己裹在披风里，静静地坐着等待。一开始他们还试着说说话，但是聊不起来。于是他们就只是干坐着。他们的耳边一直是海浪拍打沙滩的声音。

过了几个小时，感觉就像过了几个世纪，他们都知道自己刚才在打瞌睡，但是又猛地都醒了过来。星星的位置和他们之前看到的完全不同。天空一片漆黑，只有东方有着一点儿朦胧的灰色。他们很渴，浑身冰冷又僵硬。但是没有人说话，因为这会儿终于有事情发生了。

他们前面的柱子外边有一处小山的斜坡。这时山坡上开了一扇门，门口透出了亮光，一个人走了出来，门在他身后又关上了。那人拿着一盏灯，这盏灯是他们唯一能看清楚的东西。那个人慢慢地越走越近，最后站在了他们对面。这会儿，他们看到那人是一个高挑的女孩，穿着一件蓝色的长袍，露着手臂。她没戴帽子，黄发披在背后。他们看着她，觉得生平第一次知道了什么是真正的美女。

她手里拿着的那盏灯原来是一支插在银烛台上的长长的蜡烛，她把它放在了桌子上。如果夜里早些时候刮过海风的话，这会儿也肯定已经停了，因为蜡烛的火焰是笔直的，就像点在一个紧闭门窗、拉着窗帘的房间里似的。桌子上的金银器皿被烛火照得闪闪发光。

露西发现桌子上放着一样东西，之前她一直没注意到。那是一把石刀，锋利如钢，看起来古老却又杀气腾腾。

直到这会儿也没有人开口说话。雷佩契普先站了起来，凯斯宾也跟着他站了起来，接着其他人都站了起来，因为他们觉得她是位高贵的女士。

“旅人们，你们远道而来，到这阿斯兰的餐桌前，”那女孩说，“为什么不吃不喝呢？”

“小姐，”凯斯宾说，“我们不敢吃这些食物，因为我们觉得我们的朋友就是吃了这些食物才中了魔法，长眠不醒的。”

“他们根本没有尝过这些食物。”她说。

“请你告诉我们，”露西说，“他们怎么了？”

“七年前，”那女孩说，“他们乘船来到这里，船帆破破烂烂的，船骨也快要散架了。船上还有几个水手。他们来到这张桌子前，有个人说：‘这是个好地方，我们收起帆，再也不用划桨，坐在这里安度以后的日子吧！’第二个人说：‘不，我们重新上船吧，去纳尼亚，到西边去，也许米拉兹已经死了。’第三个人貌似非常专横，跳起来说：‘不，苍天在上，我们是男人，是台尔马人，我们不是畜生。我们应该干什么呢？我们只能不断地探险。反正我们也活不久了。我们还是用剩下的时间去太阳后面的无人之境一探究竟吧。’说着他们就争吵起来，他拿起桌子上的石刀，一副要和同伴们大干一架的样子。但是他不应该碰这把刀。他的手一握住刀柄，他们三个人就全都昏睡了过去。只有解除了魔法，他们才能醒过来。”

“这把石刀是用来干吗的？”尤斯塔斯问道。

“你们都不知道吗？”那女孩说。

“我……我觉得，”露西说，“我之前见过这样一把刀。很久以前，白女巫在石桌上杀死阿斯兰用的刀就长这样。”

“就是这把，”女孩说，“这把刀被带到这里，永远保存起来作为纪念。”

刚才这一会儿，艾德蒙看上去越来越局促不安。这时，他开口说：“听着，我希望我不是一个胆小鬼——要是吃了这些食物，我是说——我不是有意冒犯。但是我们在这一路上经历了很多奇怪的冒险，有时候事情不像表面上看起来那么简单。当我看着你的脸时，我忍不住会相信你说的一切。但是这样的事情往往会在碰到女巫的时候发生。我们怎么才能知道你是我们的朋友呢？”

“你没法知道，”那女孩说，“信不信由你。”

过了一会儿，雷佩契普小声说道：“陛下，麻烦您帮我从那个酒壶里倒一杯酒，那个壶太大了，我拿不起来。我要为这位小姐祝酒。”

凯斯宾照他说的做了，于是小老鼠就站在桌子上，用小爪子举起金杯，说：“小姐，为你干杯。”接着他就吃起了冷孔雀肉，不一会儿，大家都跟着一起开怀大吃。大家都饿坏了。即使这些食物不适合大早上吃，可算作一顿宵夜却是棒极了。

“为什么这叫阿斯兰的餐桌？”不一会儿露西问道。

“这是阿斯兰吩咐摆在这里的，”姑娘说，“是为了那些远道而来的人准备的。有人管这个岛叫世界尽头，因为即使你还可以走得更远，但这里就是尽头的起点。”

“但是这些食物是怎么保鲜的呢？”尤斯塔斯提了一个实际的问题。

“每天都会被吃掉，然后再另做一桌菜，”女孩说，“之后你就知道了。”

“那我们该拿这几个沉睡的人怎么办？”凯斯宾问道，“在这几位朋友生活的世界里（说到这里，他向尤斯塔斯和佩文西兄妹点了点头），有一个故事说到，一位王子或国王来到一座城堡，那里所有的人都昏睡不醒。在那个故事里，只有他亲吻了公主，才能解除魔咒。”

“但在这儿，”女孩说，“情况是不一样的。在这里，只有解除了魔咒，才能亲吻公主。”

“那么，”凯斯宾说，“以阿斯兰的名义，告诉我怎么立刻开始做这件事情。”

“我父亲会教你的。”女孩说。

“你父亲！”每个人都说，“他是谁？他在哪里？”

“看。”女孩说着，转过身来，指着山坡上的门。他们现在可以看得清楚一些了，因为他们讲话的时候，星星已经变得黯淡了，东方灰色的天空被白光撕开了巨大的口子。





第十四章　世界尽头的起点


那扇门又慢慢地打开了，门口出现一个跟那个女孩一样又高又直的身影，但却没有那么苗条。他没有拿灯，但身上似乎发着光。当他走近时，露西看到那似乎是一个老人。他的银色胡须垂到他的光脚前，头发垂到脚后跟，他身上的长袍像是用银色的羊毛制成的。他看上去那么温和，又那么严肃，于是大家都默默地站了起来。

但是老人没有和他们说话，而是站在桌子的另一边面对着他的女儿。接着他们两人举起手臂，转身面向东方，然后保持那个姿势开始唱歌。我希望我能把这首歌写下来，但在场的人没一个能记住这首歌。露西后来说那首歌的声调很高，甚至有些尖厉，但是悦耳动听。“是一种冷调的歌，一种清晨的歌。”他们唱歌时，东方天空中的灰云开始消散，透出白光的口子越开越大，直到天空变成一片雪白，海面开始闪烁着银光。过了很久（但那两个人一直在唱歌），东方天空开始泛红，最后，太阳跃出海面，阳光直射在桌面上，照在金银器皿和石刀上。

在此之前，这些纳尼亚人有一两回想过，日出的时候这里海面上的太阳看起来是不是比纳尼亚的太阳大一些。这下他们确定了，确实如此。阳光洒在露水和餐桌上，比他们以往看见的晨光耀眼得多。艾德蒙事后说：“虽然旅途上发生了很多听起来更加激动人心的事情，但那一刻才真的是最让人心潮澎湃的。”他们知道，他们真的已经到达了世界尽头的起点。

这时，似乎有什么东西正从冉冉升起的太阳的中心飞向他们，但当然，没人能一直盯着太阳看个清楚。但是不一会儿，空气中到处都是声音——唱着那父女俩正在唱的那首歌，但是音调乱多了，而且唱的语言也没人听得懂。没过多久，他们就看见了是谁发出这些声音的。那是一群又大又白的鸟，估计有成百上千只，它们停得到处都是：草地上，人行道上，桌子上，你的肩上，你的手上，你的头上，看起来就像下了一场大雪。因为，就像雪一样，它们不仅让所有的东西都变成了白色，还把所有东西的形状都变得模糊不清。但露西从遮住她的鸟翼缝隙间看到，一只鸟飞向老人，嘴里叼着什么东西，如果不是一块烧红的炭，看上去倒像一个小水果，应该是炭，因为那东西亮得让人无法直视。鸟把它放在了老人的嘴里。

接着，这群鸟停止了歌唱，在餐桌上似乎忙得不可开交。但是当它们从餐桌上飞起来的时候，桌上但凡能吃能喝的东西都不见了。成百上千只鸟吃完就飞起来了，把骨头、果皮、壳之类不能吃不能喝的东西都带着，飞向了日出的方向。但是因为这会儿它们不再唱歌，所以拍打着的翅膀让空气都一阵颤抖。那张桌子已经被清空了，干干净净的，而纳尼亚的三位老勋爵还在沉睡。

这时，那位老人终于转身面向大家，向他们表示欢迎。

“先生，”凯斯宾说，“您能不能告诉我们，怎样才能解除这三个纳尼亚勋爵沉睡的魔咒。”

“孩子，我很乐意告诉你，”老人说，“要打破这一魔咒，你们必须航行到世界的尽头，或者尽可能靠近那里，然后至少把一个伙伴留在那里，再回到这里。”

“留下的那个伙伴怎么办？”雷佩契普问。

“他必须进入最东边的地方，永不返回这个世界。”

“那正是我的心愿。”雷佩契普说。

“先生，我们现在离世界尽头很近了吗？”凯斯宾问道，“您了解更东边的海和陆地吗？”

“我很久以前看见过，”老人说，“不过是从高处看到的。我不清楚那些水手需要知道的事情。”

“你是说你当时在空中飞？”尤斯塔斯脱口而出。

“孩子，我当时在高空中，”老人回答说，“我叫拉曼杜。不过我看你们面面相觑，好像没听说过我的名字。也难怪，早在你们懂事之前，我就已经不是一颗星星了，所有的星座都变了。”

“天哪，”艾德蒙低声说，“他是一颗退休的星星。”

“你不再是星星了吗？”露西问。

“孩子，我是一颗正在休息的星星。”拉曼杜回答说，“当我最后一次落下的时候，我已经老得不像样了，于是我被带到了这个岛上。我现在已经不像当时那么老了。每天早晨都有一只鸟从太阳山谷里给我送来一颗火莓，每吃一颗我就年轻一点儿。当我变得像刚出生的孩子一样年轻时，就会重新升上天空（我们是在世界的最东边），再次在高空跳起舞来。”

“在我们的世界里，”尤斯塔斯说，“星星就是一颗巨大的火球。”

“孩子，即使在你们的世界里，星星的真身也不是一团火球，那不过是它的组成部分而已。在这个世界里，你们已经遇见过一颗星星了，你们应该见过柯瑞金了吧？”

“他也是一颗正在休息的星星吗？”露西说。

“说起来，情况倒不完全一样，”拉曼杜说，“他被发配去管那些笨蛋，算不上是休息。可以称之为惩罚。如果当时没出事的话，他原本可能会在冬天的南方天空中闪耀几千年。”

“先生，他犯了什么事？”凯斯宾问道。

“孩子，”拉曼杜说，“你是个凡人，不该知道星星犯过什么错。不过算了，我们谈论这些事是在浪费时间。你们决定了吗？要不要继续把船往东边开，留下一个人，再回到这里来，以此来打破魔咒？还是你们要往西边去？”

“陛下，当然，”雷佩契普说，“这没什么好犹豫的吧？显然，把这三位勋爵从魔咒中解救出来也是我们此行目的的一部分。”

“我也这么想，雷佩契普，”凯斯宾答道，“就算不是为了救他们，但如果可以把黎明踏浪号开到世界的尽头，而我们不去，我也会很伤心的。不过我替我们的船员想一下。他们签字画押是来寻找七位勋爵的，不是为了到达世界的尽头。如果我们从这里向东航行，那就是去找寻地球的边缘，极东之地。没有人知道那有多远。他们是勇敢的伙计，但我清楚地知道有迹象表明他们中的一些人已经厌倦了这次航行，渴望着能返回到纳尼亚。我认为，如果他们不同意，我就不该再继续往前航行了。还有可怜的罗普勋爵。他已经崩溃了。”

“孩子，”星星拉曼杜说，“就算你希望这么做，带着不愿去或者被骗去世界尽头的人，你们到了那里也没用。这样是没法破解魔咒的。他们必须知道他们要去哪里，还有为什么去。可是你说的崩溃的人是谁？”

凯斯宾把罗普勋爵的事告诉了拉曼杜。

“我可以把他最需要的东西给他，”拉曼杜说，“在这个岛上是可以一直沉睡毫无限制，梦中一点点儿脚步声都听不到。就让他坐在这三个人的旁边，喝得不省人事，在这里等你们回来。”

“啊，那我们就这么办吧，凯斯宾，”露西说，“我肯定这也正是他想要的。”

这时，一阵脚步声和说话声打断了他们。德里宁和剩下的船员们都来了。他们看见拉曼杜和他的女儿，满脸惊讶地停下来。他们发现这两个人显然是什么重要人物，于是一个个都脱帽致敬。一些水手满脸遗憾地看着桌上的空盘和空酒壶。

“大人，”凯斯宾对德里宁说，“请派两个人回到黎明踏浪号上给罗普勋爵带个信。告诉他，他以前同船的伙伴都在这里沉睡很久了——而且不会做梦——他也可以来这里睡觉。”

接着，凯斯宾让其余的人坐下来，跟他们解释眼前的情况。他说完后大家沉默了良久，有些人在低声谈论。这时弓箭手的头领站起来说道：“陛下，我们有些人一直想问，我们掉头之后怎么回家呢？不管是在这里掉头也好，还是在其他什么地方掉头也好。这一路上吹的都是西风和西北风，只有偶尔是风平浪静的。如果回去的时候还是如此，我们怕是没希望回到纳尼亚了。我们要是一路划桨，船上的补给品也没多大把握能够维持这段行程。”

“没出过海的人才会说出这种话，”德里宁说，“这些海域在夏末总会刮西风，但是过了年风向就变了。我们往西开会遇上不少顺风，会多到我们烦。”

“大人，确实如此，”一位出生在加尔马的老水手说，“在一月和二月，东边的天气总是很恶劣。还有，陛下，请您宽恕，如果让我来指挥这艘船，我就让大家在这里过冬，三月再启程回家。”

“你们在这里过冬的话吃什么呢？”尤斯塔斯问道。

“这张餐桌，”拉曼杜说，“每天日落时都会摆满一桌国王的盛宴。”

“这就对了！”几个水手说。

“陛下，先生们，女士们，”莱斯说，“我只想说一件事。这次出海，我们中没有一个是被逼来的。我们都是自愿来的。有些人在这里死死地盯着那张餐桌，心里琢磨着国王的盛宴，当初我们从凯尔帕拉维尔出发的时候，他们还在大声谈论着冒险，发誓不到世界尽头就绝不回家。有些人站在码头上，愿意抛弃一切和我们一起出海。当时，人们觉得黎明踏浪号上的一个船舱服务员的铺位比骑士的腰带还要宝贵。我不知道你们有没有听懂我的话。我想说的是，如果我们回到家，说我们到达了世界尽头的起点，但是不够胆继续往前走，那我们看起来就像那些笨蛋瓜一样愚蠢了。”

一些水手听了这番话欢呼起来，可是还有些人说这话倒也不错。

“情况似乎不太妙，”艾德蒙悄悄地对凯斯宾说，“要是一半的人都退缩了，我们该怎么办？”

“等一下，”凯斯宾轻声回答，“我还有一招。”

“你不打算说点儿什么吗，雷佩？”露西小声说道。

“不，陛下为什么要这么想呢？”雷佩契普用大多数人都听得见的声音说，“我有自己的计划。要是可以的话，我就乘黎明踏浪号往东去。如果不行，我就划自己的小船去。如果我的小船沉了，我就用我的四只爪子游过去。要是我游不动了，还没到阿斯兰的国度，或者被大瀑布冲下世界的边缘，我沉下去的时候也要面对日出的方向，到时就让佩比西克当纳尼亚会说话的老鼠的首领。”

“说得好，说得好，”一个水手说，“我想说的也一样，除了小船那一部分，因为我坐不下。”说完他又低声加了一句，“我不能不如一只老鼠。”

这时，凯斯宾忽然跳了起来。“朋友们，”他说，“我觉得你们还没有完全理解我们的意思。你们说得好像我们低声下气地求你们和我们同船出海呢。不是这样的。我们和我们的国王与女王，他们的亲戚，优秀的骑士雷佩契普爵士，还有德里宁勋爵，都有到达世界尽头的使命。我们很乐意从你们这些愿意去的人当中挑选我们认为能担起如此崇高使命的人。我们可没说谁都能参加。因此，我们现在要让德里宁勋爵和莱斯大人慎重地考虑你们当中谁在战斗中最顽强，谁是技巧最熟练的海员，谁的血统最纯正，谁最忠诚，谁的生活作风最清白，然后把这些人的名字列个名单给我们。”他停顿了一下，然后语速很快地继续往下说，“阿斯兰在上！”他大声说道，“你们以为看到世界尽头的特权是轻轻松松就能得到的吗？每一个跟我们一起出海的人都能把黎明踏浪号的称号传给他的后代。我们回到凯尔帕拉维尔的时候，每个人都将分得大量的黄金或土地，够过一辈子富足的生活。现在，你们所有人都在岛上散开。半小时后，我就会让德里宁勋爵把名单交给我。”

说罢，大家都默不作声，船员们鞠了一躬就离开了。他们往不同方向散去，但大多都三五成群地说着话。

“现在要说罗普勋爵的事了。”凯斯宾说。

他转向餐桌首席，却看见罗普已经在那里了。刚刚在大家讨论的时候他已经到了，坐在阿尔格兹勋爵边上，他一直默不作声，没人注意到他。拉曼杜的女儿站在他身边，好像刚刚扶他坐上椅子。拉曼杜站在他身后，双手放在罗普灰白的头上。即使是在阳光下，老人的手上依然发出微弱的银光。罗普憔悴的脸上顿时露出了笑容。他把一只手伸向露西，另一只手伸向凯斯宾。一时间，他似乎要说些什么。接着，他的笑容明朗起来，似乎体会到了一种美妙的感觉。他的嘴里发出一声满足的长叹，头往前一倾就睡着了。

“可怜的罗普，”露西说，“我很高兴。他一定经历了许多可怕的事情。”

“别想了。”尤斯塔斯说。

与此同时，也许是因为岛上的魔法，凯斯宾的演讲开始按照他的想法起效了。很多人刚刚还对继续远航焦虑不已，这会儿却生怕自己没被选中。当然，随着越来越多的水手宣称下定决心请求出海，剩下不想继续远航的人觉得他们人数越来越少，感到越来越不自在了。所以半个小时还不到，就有几个人对德里宁和莱斯“拍马屁”（至少我学校里的人就用这种说法），想要获得一个好的评价。很快就只剩下三个不想去的人了，这三个人正在努力地说服别人留下来。没过多久，只剩下一个人了。最后，他开始害怕就自己一个人被留下来，于是也改变了主意。

半小时到了，他们都列队回到阿斯兰的餐桌前，站在桌子的一端，德里宁和莱斯走过去和凯斯宾坐到一起，开始向他汇报。凯斯宾接受了所有的人，只留下了最后一刻改变主意的那个人。他的名字叫皮顿克林，其他人都出发去寻找世界尽头的时候，他一直待在那个星岛上，他特别希望自己当时能和他们一起走。他不喜欢跟拉曼杜和拉曼杜的女儿说话（他们也不喜欢和他说话），而且那里总是下雨，尽管餐桌上每天晚上都有丰盛的宴席，他却不怎么想吃。他说，他一个人和那四位沉睡的勋爵一起坐在餐桌前（不管刮风下雨都是如此），真是感到毛骨悚然。其他人回来后，他觉得自己被孤立了，于是他在到达孤独群岛时离开了回家的船队，去了卡罗门居住，他在那里讲述自己在世界尽头的奇遇，说到最后连自己都信以为真了。所以从某种意义上说，他从此也算得上生活得很幸福。但是他看见老鼠就受不了。

那天晚上，他们一起在柱子间的大餐桌上大吃大喝。第二天早晨，就在那些大鸟飞来又飞走的时候，黎明踏浪号再次扬帆起航。

“小姐，”凯斯宾对拉曼杜的女儿说，“等我破除了魔咒，希望能再和你谈谈。”她看着他微微一笑。





第十五章　最后一片大海的奇观


他们离开拉曼杜所在的岛后不久，就开始感到已经把船开出了这个世界。一切都不同了。第一件事就是，大家都发现自己睡觉需要的时间变短了。他们都不想上床，也不想多吃，甚至都不太愿意说话，要说也是轻声细语的。第二件事是亮光。这里太亮了。每天早晨太阳升起的时候，就算没有平时的三倍大，也有两倍大。每天早晨，那些巨大的白鸟都用人类的声音唱着谁也听不懂的歌，飞往阿斯兰的餐桌去吃早餐，这些鸟从他们的头顶掠过，然后消失在船尾（露西觉得最奇怪的就是这点了）。不一会儿，它们又飞回来，消失在东方。

“水多么清澈美丽啊！”第二天下午早些时候，露西靠在左舷上自言自语地说。

确实如此。第一件引起她注意的是一个黑色的小东西，大约有一只鞋那么大，速度和船一样快，一路跟着船。一时间她以为那东西是浮在水面上的。但接着，海面上又漂来了一小块厨师刚从厨房扔出来的陈面包。那块面包好像快要撞上那个黑色的东西了，但是没撞上，而是从它上面漂过，露西这才知道那个黑色的东西并不在水面上。接着，那个黑色的东西突然变得很大，一会儿又恢复到原来的大小。

这下，露西想到她在别的地方看到过这样的景象——要是她能记起在哪儿看到的就好了。她一手撑着头，板着脸，伸着舌头使劲想。最后终于想起来了。是啊！这就和阳光明媚的时候你从火车上往外看的景象一样。你看见自己那节车厢的黑影和火车一样快地奔跑在田野上。火车开进路堑的时候，那黑影会突然一下靠近你，同时还会变大，沿着路堑边的草地一路奔跑。等到火车开出路堑的时候，猛地一下，黑影又会变回原来的大小，继续沿着田野奔跑。

“这是我们的影子！是黎明踏浪号的影子，”露西说，“我们的影子在海底奔跑。它越过山坡的时候会变大。要是这样的话，水一定比我想象的还要清澈哩！天哪，我一定看到很深很深的海底了。”

她刚说完，就意识到自己不知不觉看了好久的那一大片银色实际上是海底的沙子。那些或深或浅的斑块不是海面上的光影，而是海底的东西哩。比如说现在，他们正在经过一大片紫绿色的东西，中间有一条弯弯曲曲的浅灰色宽带。既然现在她知道这是海底的东西，看起来就更清楚了。她能看到那一小片黑色的东西比其他的东西要高得多，而且还轻轻地摆动着。“就像风中的树，”露西说，“我相信这些东西真的是树。这是一个海底森林。”

他们从那片森林上方经过，这时，那条灰色的带子和另一条灰色的带子交会了。“要是我在下面就好了，”露西想，“那条带子就像是一条林间的路。两条带子交会的地方就是一个十字路口。啊，我真希望我在下面啊。嗨！这片森林就快走完啦。我相信那条带子就是一条路！我还能看见它穿过空旷的沙地呢。它的颜色变了，边缘还标着虚线。也许那是石头。这会儿它又变宽了。”

但它并没有真的变宽，而是离得更近了。她意识到这一点，因为船影经过的时候，那条路仿佛朝船身冲了过来。她现在确定这是一条路了，这条路开始变得弯弯曲曲。显然，它是一条爬上一座陡峭的小山的路。当她侧着头向后看时，就像从山顶往下看一条蜿蜒的路一样。她甚至可以看到阳光穿过深深的海水，照耀在树木繁茂的山谷中。在最远处，一切都化成一团朦朦胧胧的绿色。但有些地方——据她看，是照着阳光的地方——倒是深蓝色的。

但是，她不能花很多时间回头看，因为前面的景象简直是惊心动魄。显然，这条路已经通向了山顶，接着笔直向前。路上还有许多小斑点在来回移动。这时，幸亏阳光充足——阳光照射到海底时仍然很亮，有一样奇妙无比的东西映入眼帘。那东西凸起来，边缘参差不齐的，颜色像珍珠，又像象牙。她差不多就在那东西的正上方，起初几乎看不出那是什么。但当她看到它的影子时，就知道是什么东西了。阳光照过露西的肩膀，所以那东西的影子就在它后面的沙地上。她看着它的形状，清楚地看到那是高塔、尖塔、宣礼塔和圆顶的影子。

“哎呀！原来是一座城市，也可能是一座巨大的城堡，”露西自言自语地说，“但不知道为什么它会建在一座高山顶上？”

很久以后，她已经回到了英国，和艾德蒙谈论这些奇遇的时候，他们想到了一个原因，我很确定这原因是对的。在大海里，越深的地方就越黑暗，越寒冷。乌贼、海蛇和海怪之类危险的生物就出没在那种又黑又冷的地方。山谷就是荒蛮危险的地方。海人们对山谷的感觉就和我们对大山的感觉一样，他们对大山的感觉就和我们对山谷的感觉一样。高处（或者，用我们的话说就是“在浅的地方”）才是温暖又安全的地方。海里那些胆子大的猎人和勇敢的骑士会去深海里探险，但他们会回到高处安心休息，和别人社交、议事、娱乐、唱歌、跳舞。

他们已经开过了这座城市，海底还在往上升，现在离船底只有几百英尺了。那条路已经不见了。他们在一个公园似的旷野上方航行，上面点缀着一片片色彩鲜艳的植被。接着，露西差点儿激动得尖叫起来——她看见了人。

一共有十五到二十个人，全都骑在海马上——不是你在博物馆里看到的那种小海马，而是身材比他们还高大的马。露西想，他们一定是贵族，因为她能看到水中一些人的额头上金光闪闪，他们肩膀上还飘动着翠绿色或橘红色的彩带。突然，露西说：“哦，这些鱼真烦人！”原来是一群肥肥的小鱼，挡在了她和海人之间。虽然它们挡住了她的视线，却让她看到了一件顶有趣的事情。

突然，一条她从未见过的凶猛小鱼从下面蹿上来，猛地咬住了一条肥肥的小鱼，死死地叼在嘴里，飞速地沉了下去。那些海人都坐在他们的马上，抬头看着眼前发生的事情。他们好像有说有笑。刚刚那条捕猎的鱼还没带着猎物回到他们身边，就又有一条同类的鱼从海里蹿上来。露西差不多可以断定，就是人群中间那个骑着海马的大块头把猎鱼放出来的，他刚才好像一直把鱼放在手里或者手腕上。

“我敢说，”露西说，“这是一个狩猎队。或者更像一个用鹰狩猎的团队。是的，就是这样。他们手腕上带着这些凶悍的小鱼骑马出来，就像我们在凯尔帕拉维尔当国王和王后的时候。然后他们就会放飞猎鱼——也许我应该说放游猎鱼——去捕捉猎物。”

她突然不说话了，因为眼前的景象变了。那些海人注意到了黎明踏浪号。那群鱼四处乱窜，那些人也正往上面来，看看这个挡住太阳的黑色庞然大物是什么。这时他们已经离海面很近了，如果他们在露天，不是在水里，露西都可以和他们对话了。这群人里面有男有女。每个人都戴着一种冠冕，很多人都戴着珍珠项链。他们没穿其他的衣服。他们身体的颜色像是陈年的象牙，头发是深紫色的。国王就在最中间（没人会弄错这一点），他骄傲而凶狠地盯着露西，手里挥着一支矛。他的骑士和他是一样的动作。那些女士则是一脸惊讶。露西觉得他们肯定从来没见过船，也没见过人类。当然了，他们生活在世界尽头以外的海域，从来没有船来到过这里，怎么可能见过呢？

“你在盯着什么看，露？”她身边响起一个声音。

露西正沉浸在她眼前的景象中，听到声音吓了一跳。她转过身来，发现自己保持一个姿势倚在栏杆上太长时间，手臂已经僵了。在她身边的是德里宁和艾德蒙。

“看。”她说。

他们两人都看了一眼，但德里宁马上低声说：“陛下，马上转过身来——对，背对着大海。不要表现得看起来像在讨论什么重要的事情。”

“为什么，怎么了？”露西边照做边问。

“不要让水手们看到这景象，”德里宁说，“否则会有人爱上海里的女人，或者爱上海底世界，为此从船上跳下去。我以前听说在陌生的海域发生过这样的事情。看到这些人总是会倒霉。”

“但是我们以前认识他们，”露西说，“之前在凯尔帕拉维尔，那时我的哥哥彼得还是至尊王。他们来到海面上，为我们的加冕典礼唱歌。”

“我想那一定是另一种海人，露。”艾德蒙说，“那些人可以生活在空气中，也可以生活在水中。我觉得这些人不能在空气中生活。看他们的样子，要是他们办得到的话，早就露出海面攻击我们了。他们看起来非常凶狠。”

“不管怎么说……”德里宁还没说完，就听到两种声音。先是一声扑通的落水声。接着便从观测台传来一声喊：“有人落水了！”一时间，每个人都忙得不可开交。有些水手急匆匆爬上去收帆，其他的水手急忙跑下去划桨，莱斯正在船尾楼值班，他开始用力转舵，好把船转回来救那个落水的人。但是这时，大家都发现落水的严格来说根本不是人，而是雷佩契普。

“那只老鼠真见鬼！”德里宁说，“他惹的麻烦比船上其他人加起来的都多。要是有什么坏事，他准有份！就应该把他铐起来，绑在龙骨上，然后再把他放逐到荒岛上，剃掉他的胡须。谁看得见那个小浑蛋？”

德里宁嘴上说着这些狠话，但是不代表他真的不喜欢雷佩契普。恰恰相反，他非常喜欢雷佩契普，所以怕雷佩契普出事，他发脾气是因为害怕——就像你的母亲会因为你跑到马路上迎上汽车生你的气，但是陌生人就不会这样。当然，没有人担心雷佩契普溺水，因为他水性很好。但是，那三个清楚水下情况的人，却担心着那些海人手中锋利的长矛。

几分钟后，黎明踏浪号掉过头来，大家都看见了水里的一团黑乎乎的东西，那就是雷佩契普。他激动得吱吱喳喳说个不停，但是他的嘴里灌满了水，谁也听不懂他在说些什么。

“如果我们不让他闭嘴，他就会把整件事情捅出来。”德里宁叫道。为了阻止事情发生，他冲到船舷，亲自放下一根缆绳，对水手们喊道：“好了，好了。回到你们的位置上去吧。捞一只老鼠而已，不用帮忙。”雷佩契普沿着绳子往上爬，不像平时那样敏捷，因为他的毛都浸湿了，身子很沉。这时，德里宁弯下腰悄悄地对他说：“不要说。一句话都别说。”

但是，浑身湿透的老鼠爬上了甲板，却表现得对海人丝毫不感兴趣。

“甜的！”他吱吱地叫，“甜的，甜的！”

“你在说什么？”德里宁生气地问，“而且你也用不着把水全抖在我身上。”

“我说水是甜的，”老鼠说，“又甜又新鲜。这水不是咸的。”

一时间，谁也没反应过来这事多么重要。但是，雷佩契普又一次重复了那古老的预言：

在海水香甜的地方，

雷佩契普不要彷徨，

大胆追寻你心所想，

那就是世界的东方。

于是大家终于都明白了。

“莱斯，给我拿一个水桶过来。”德里宁说。

他拿到水桶，放进水里又吊起来。桶里的水像玻璃一样闪闪发光。

“陛下您想不想先尝尝？”德里宁对凯斯宾说。

国王两手捧着水桶，把它举到嘴边，抿了一口，又深深地喝了一大口，然后抬起了头。他的脸都变了。不仅眼睛更亮了，整个人都显得容光焕发。

“是的，”他说，“这水是甜的。这才是真正的水啊。我不确定喝了这水会不会死。但是我现在知道这水的滋味了，死也值了。”

“这是什么意思？”艾德蒙问道。

“它——它比任何东西都更像光。”凯斯宾说。

“正是这样，”雷佩契普说，“可以喝的光。我们现在一定很靠近世界尽头了。”

大家都沉默了片刻。露西跪在甲板上，从桶里舀水喝。

“我从来没尝到过这么好的东西，”她喘着气说，“不过，啊呀——太香浓了。我们现在什么都不用吃了。”

船上的每个人都轮流喝了一通。他们沉默了很长时间。他们觉得这水太妙了，而且特别香浓，都快承受不住了。不久，他们发现了另一件事。正如我之前说过的，自从他们离开拉曼杜所在的岛，光线就太强了——太阳太大（虽然不是太热），海面太亮，天空太耀眼。现在，虽然光线没有变暗——就算有变化也是变强了——但是他们可以忍受了。他们可以眼睛一眨不眨地直视太阳。他们能注视比以前见过的更强烈的亮光。甲板、船帆、他们自己的脸和身体都变得越来越明亮，每根缆绳都闪闪发光。第二天早晨，太阳升起的时候已经是原来大小的五六倍了，他们使劲地盯着它，甚至能看到从那里飞过来的鸟的羽毛。

那天，船上几乎没有人说一句话，直到晚餐时间（没有人想吃晚饭，对他们来说喝那水就足够了）德里宁说：“我想不通。明明一丝风都没有，船帆挂着一动不动，海面也平静得像个池塘，我们的船却开得飞快，好像后面有大风吹着一样。”

“我也一直在想这件事，”凯斯宾说，“我们一定是遇上了强大的水流。”

“嗯，”艾德蒙说，“如果世界真的有边缘，而我们正在接近它的话，情况就不太妙了。”

“你的意思是说，”凯斯宾说，“我们的船可能会——呃，就这样从边缘掉下去？”

“对，对，”雷佩契普拍着他的爪子叫道，“我经常这样想象——世界就像一个大圆桌，各大洋的水无穷无尽地从边缘流下去。在我们经过边缘的时候，船会翻过来，然后一直急速地往下冲。”

“啊？你觉得底下等着我们的是什么呢？”德里宁说。

“也许是阿斯兰的国度，”老鼠眼神发光地说，“或许根本就没有底。我们可能会永远往下掉。但不管怎么样，只要能去世界边缘的外面看上一眼，付出任何代价都值得。”

“但是你听我说，”尤斯塔斯说，“这全是胡说八道。世界是圆的——我是说，圆得像个球，不像一张桌子。”

“我们的世界是这样的，”艾德蒙说，“但这个世界也是这样吗？”

“你的意思是说，”凯斯宾问，“你们三个来自一个圆圆（圆得像个球）的世界，却从来没有告诉过我这件事！你们真是太不厚道了。我们的童话故事里提到过这样的世界，我一直非常喜欢。我从来不相信真的有圆球形的世界。但我一直希望有，而且我一直渴望生活在这样一个世界。哦，我愿意付出任何代价——我想知道为什么你们能进入我们的世界而我们却从来不能进入你们的世界？我要是有机会去就好了！住在像球一样的地方一定很刺激。你有没有去过那些人们倒着走路的地方？”

艾德蒙摇了摇头。“事情并不是这样的，”他加了一句，“你要是到了圆球形的世界，也没什么特别让人激动的事情。”





第十六章　世界的尽头


除了德里宁和佩文西兄妹，船上只有雷佩契普发现了那些海人。他一看到海王挥舞着他的长矛，就觉得受到了威胁和挑战，于是当即潜入水中，想要一决胜负。他一下水就发现海水非常新鲜，那股兴奋劲分散了他的注意力，他还没来得及想起那些海人，露西和德里宁就把他拉到一边，警告他不要提到他看见的一切。

事实证明，他们根本用不着担心，因为此时黎明踏浪号正在海面上滑行，这片海域看上去似乎无人居住。除了露西以外，没有人看到那些海人，连她也只是短短地瞥到一眼。第二天整个上午，他们都在相当浅的水里航行，海底长满了杂草。就在中午之前，露西看见一大群鱼在杂草上游过。它们都吃个不停，朝着同一个方向游动。“它们像一群羊似的。”露西心想。突然，她在鱼群中看到了一个小海女，和她差不多年纪。那个小海女看起来文静又孤独，手里拿着一把弯钩似的东西。露西觉得这个女孩一定是牧羊女——或者说是一名牧鱼女，那群鱼就像在牧场中进食的牲畜群似的。鱼群和那个女孩都离水面很近。那个女孩在浅水里滑行，而露西则靠在舷墙上。两人正好面对面，那女孩抬起头，直直地盯着露西的脸。她们没法和对方说话，不一会儿，海女就落到船后面了。但是露西永远不会忘记她的脸。她的表情不像其他海人那样害怕或愤怒。露西很喜欢那个女孩，她觉得那个女孩也一定很喜欢她。就在那一刻，她们不知怎的就成了朋友。不管是在那个世界还是在任何其他地方，她们应该都没有机会再见面了。但是万一她们真的见面了，一定会伸出手冲向对方。

接下来好多天横桅索上没有风，船头也没有泡沫，黎明踏浪号平稳地向东滑行，穿过了一片平静的海面。光线每天每时都变得更加强烈，但是他们仍旧受得了。没有人吃饭或睡觉，也没有人想吃饭睡觉。但他们从海里打起一桶又一桶亮晶晶的水，这水比酒更浓，比普通的水更湿润、更清澈。他们默默地干杯，然后一饮而尽。有一两个水手在启航时已经上了年纪，现在却每天越来越年轻。船上的每个人都非常喜悦和兴奋，但是却并不想说话。越往前航行，他们话说得越少，后来几乎都像是在说悄悄话似的。最后那片大海的寂静笼罩着他们。

“大人，”有一天凯斯宾对德里宁说，“你看前面是什么？”

“陛下，”德里宁说，“白茫茫的一片。从北向南，我放眼看去全是白茫茫的。”

“我看到的也是这样，”凯斯宾说，“我想象不出来那是什么东西。”

“陛下，如果我们在纬度高一点儿的地方，”德里宁说，“我会说那应该是冰。但是这里不可能有冰。虽然如此，我们最好还是派人去划桨，别让船随着水流漂了。不管那是什么东西，我们都不能以这种速度撞上去！”

于是大家照德里宁说的去划桨，让船开得越来越慢。等他们靠近了，那团白色的东西仍旧那么神秘。要说是陆地的话，这也一定是一片奇怪的陆地，因为它看起来就像水一样光滑，还和水面一样高。他们贴近它的时候，德里宁使劲转舵，让黎明踏浪号朝南，这样舷侧就对着水流，再划桨沿着那片白色的边缘往南开。他们正这么做，却意外有了个重大的发现：这道水流只有大约四十英尺宽，而其余的海水还是静得像一片池塘。对船员们来说，这真是个好消息。他们已经开始想若返程回到拉曼杜所在的岛上，得一路划桨逆流而上，那可要累坏了。（怪不得刚刚那个牧鱼的海女很快就落到后面去了，因为她不在水流里。如果她顺着水流的话，就能和船一样快地往东边来了。）

不过，还是没有人知道这些白色的东西是什么。于是他们放下小船，派人去查探一番。那些留在黎明踏浪号上的人可以看到，小船一下就扎进了那一片白茫茫的东西里。接着，他们清楚地听到小船里的人（透过平静的水面）大惊小怪的说话声。然后，莱斯在小船的船头测了水深，大家安静了一小会儿。之后，他们划着小船回来，船里好像有很多那种白色的东西。大家都挤到舷侧去听他们带回来的消息。

“陛下，是百合！”莱斯站在船头喊道。

“你说什么？”凯斯宾问道。

“盛开的百合花，陛下，”莱斯说，“跟池塘和花园里的一样。”

“看！”露西站在小船的船尾说，她湿漉漉的胳膊里捧满了白色的花瓣和扁扁的宽叶子。

“莱尼，水有多深？”德里宁问。

“船长，真是有趣，”莱斯说，“水还是很深。足足有三英寻半。”

“这些不可能是真正的百合花，不是我们说的那种百合花。”尤斯塔斯说。

这些可能不是百合花，但是和百合花像极了。他们商量了一下，又把黎明踏浪号掉头开进水流中，继续往东行驶，开始穿过百合花湖，或者也叫银海（这两个名字他们都用过，但是银海这个说法沿用了下来，凯斯宾的地图上现在标的也是这个名字）。这时，他们这次远航最稀奇的部分开始了。没过多久，他们驶过的那片广阔的海域就变成了西地平线上一条细细的蓝边。他们周围都是白茫茫的一片，还闪烁着微弱的金色。只有船身排开百合花，在船尾处留下一条水路，像深绿色的玻璃一样闪闪发光。

仔细看看，这最后的一片海很像北极。如果他们的眼睛现在不是像鹰一样厉害，太阳照在这白茫茫的一片上时，尤其是在清晨太阳最大的时候，他们根本受不了。每天傍晚，那白茫茫的一片让白天变得更长了。这片百合花似乎没有尽头。连绵的百合花每天都飘出一股露西觉得难以形容的气味。虽然很香，但是没有香得过浓或让人昏昏欲睡，而是一种清新、狂野又孤独的香味，好像会侵入你的大脑，让你觉得自己有力气跑上山，或者能够和一头大象搏斗。她和凯斯宾都对对方说：“我觉得我受不了了，但是我又不想离开这股香味。”

他们经常测水深，但是过了好几天水才变浅。之后，水越来越浅。有一天，他们不得不划船离开水流，像蜗牛似的划桨前进。很快，他们就发现黎明踏浪号没法再继续往东开了。事实上，多亏了巧妙的处理，他们才使她免于搁浅。

“把小船放下来，”凯斯宾叫道，“把大家都叫到船尾来。我得说几句话。”

“他打算怎么办？”尤斯塔斯低声对艾德蒙说，“我觉得他眼神怪怪的。”

“我觉得我们看起来可能也一样。”艾德蒙说。

他们到船尾集合，很快所有人都挤在梯脚处，听国王讲话。“朋友们，”凯斯宾说，“我们已经完成了你们上船的使命。七位勋爵都有了下落。既然雷佩契普爵士发誓绝不回去，你们回到拉曼杜所在的岛上时，雷维廉勋爵、阿尔格兹勋爵和马夫拉蒙勋爵一定都已经醒了。德里宁大人，我把这艘船交给你，命令你以最快的速度开回纳尼亚，记住不要在死水岛登陆。让我的摄政王，矮人杜鲁普金，把我承诺的奖赏赐给我所有同船的伙伴。他们当之无愧。如果我回不来，我的遗嘱是让摄政王、科内留斯大人、特鲁佛汉特和德里宁勋爵共同选举出纳尼亚的新国王……”

“可是，陛下，”德里宁打断他说，“您是要退位吗？”

“我要和雷佩契普一起去看世界的尽头。”凯斯宾说。

水手们发出一阵惊讶的低语声。

“我们要用小船，”凯斯宾说，“在这么平静的海上你们用不着，到了拉曼杜所在的岛上你们一定要再造一条小船。那么……”

“凯斯宾，”艾德蒙突然厉声说道，“你不能这么做。”

“当然，”雷佩契普说，“陛下您不能这么做。”

“确实不能。”德里宁说。

“不能吗？”凯斯宾严厉地说，一时间看起来就像他叔叔米拉兹一样。

“请陛下宽恕，”莱斯在下面的甲板上说，“可是如果我们当中有一个人这么做，就叫作擅离职守。”

“莱斯，你虽然为我效劳多年，但是说这种话未免也太放肆了。”凯斯宾说。

“不，陛下！他说得一点儿没错。”德里宁说。

“阿斯兰在上，”凯斯宾说，“你们应该是我的臣民，不是我的老师。”

“我不是你的臣民，”艾德蒙说，“我说你不能这么做。”

“又是不能，”凯斯宾说，“你说这话什么意思？”

“陛下息怒，我们的意思是这么做不妥，”雷佩契普深深地鞠了一躬说，“您是纳尼亚的国王。如果您不回去，您就是对您所有的臣民失信了，尤其是对杜鲁普金。您不是一个普通人，不能对这些冒险沾沾自喜。如果陛下听不进去，那么船上所有的人都只能和我一起拿走您的武器，把您绑起来，直到您醒悟过来，这是我们真正的忠心。”

“说得对，”艾德蒙说，“就像尤利西斯想接近塞壬[1]时，别人对他做的那样。”

凯斯宾已经把手放到了剑柄上。这时，露西说：“你几乎答应过拉曼杜的女儿说会回去。”

凯斯宾停顿了一下。“哦，对。确实有这回事。”他说道。他犹豫不决地站了一会儿，然后对着船员们大声喊道：“好吧，听你们的吧。探险结束了。我们都回去吧。把小船再收上来。”

“陛下，”雷佩契普说，“不是都回去。我，我之前说明过……”

“安静！”凯斯宾雷霆大怒，“我已经受过你们的教训了，但是我不愿再受捉弄。难道没人让这老鼠闭嘴吗？”

“陛下答应过，”雷佩契普说，“要为纳尼亚会说话的兽类做一个好君王。”

“会说话的兽类，是的，”凯斯宾说，“我可没说包括那些说个没完的兽类。”他生气地下了梯子，走进船舱，砰地关上了门。

但是过了一会儿，别人去找他的时候，发现他的脸色都变了，面色苍白，眼里还含着泪水。

“我真是不中用，”他说，“尽管我做事很执拗，还喜欢摆架子，可是我本该举止得体。阿斯兰跟我谈过了。不——我不是说他真的在这里。首先，船舱太小，也容不下他。但是墙上那个金狮子的头活过来了，还对我说了些话。他的眼睛实在太可怕了。倒不是说他对我很粗暴——只是一开始有点儿严厉。但是不管怎么说还是很可怕。他说……他说……哦，我受不了了。这是他说的最糟糕的事了。你们都要继续往前——雷佩、艾德蒙、露西和尤斯塔斯，我却要回去。孤零零一个人。得马上回去。这一切还有什么用呢？”

“凯斯宾，亲爱的，”露西说，“你知道我们迟早要回到自己的世界。”

“是啊，”凯斯宾抽泣着说，“但没想到这么快。”

“你回到拉曼杜所在的岛上后就会感觉好些的。”露西说。

过了一会儿，他又高兴起来。但对他们任何一方来说，分开都是痛苦的，我还是不细说了。下午两点钟左右，他们准备了充足的粮食和水（尽管他们认为他们既不需要吃东西也不需要喝水），把雷佩契普的小艇放下来后，他们就划着小船离开了黎明踏浪号，穿过那片无穷无尽的百合花海。黎明踏浪号飘扬着所有的旗帜，挂着盾牌，隆重地给他们送行。他们坐在小船里，周围都是百合花，抬头仰望又高又大的黎明踏浪号，觉得她看起来亲切极了。他们目送着大船掉头，开始慢慢地向西边划去，驶离了他们的视线。露西虽然流了几滴眼泪，但是她并没有你想象的那么难受。这里的亮光、宁静、银海散发出来那扣人心弦的香味，甚至是这种孤独感（虽然这么说有点儿奇怪），都让人激动不已。

他们不用划船，水流一直带着他们往东漂去。他们都不睡觉，也不吃东西。那天整个晚上和第二天整整一天，他们一直都在向东滑行。直到第三天破晓，光线强烈得就算你我戴上墨镜也受不了，他们见到了前面的奇观。仿佛有一堵青灰色的、颤动的、闪闪发光的墙挡在他们和天空之间。接着太阳升起来了，他们透过那堵墙看到了初升的太阳，太阳折射出奇幻的七彩光芒。这下他们明白了，那堵墙其实是一道又长又高的波浪——一道固定在一个地方的波浪，就像时常可以在瀑布边上看到的水流一样。它看起来大约有三十英尺高，而水流正带着他们迅速地向它滑行。你可能以为他们会想到有危险。但是他们没有。我觉得任何人在那种情况下都不会想到危险。因为他们不仅看到了海浪背后的景象，还看到了太阳背后的景象。如果他们的眼睛没有经过最后那片海水的强化，他们甚至连太阳都没法去看。但是现在他们可以看到升起的太阳，看得很清楚，还看到了太阳外面的景象。他们往东边看，看见太阳后面有一列山脉。那山脉太高了。他们看不见顶，也有可能是他们忘了。谁也不记得看到那个方向有天空。那些山一定是在世界之外。因为任何山峰即便是只有它几十分之一的高度，山上也应该有冰雪。但这些山放眼看去都是温暖的绿意，遍布森林和瀑布，无论多高的地方都是如此。突然，从东方吹来一阵微风，把浪尖吹成了泡沫的形状，周围平静的海水也泛起了波澜。这景象只持续了一秒钟左右，但是这三个孩子永远也不会忘记那一刻的感受。风中夹杂着一种气味和一阵声音。那是一阵悦耳的声音，艾德蒙和尤斯塔斯之后对此绝口不提。露西只想得出这一句：“真是让人心碎啊。”我说：“为什么，这声音有那么伤感吗？”露西说：“伤感？不是。”

小船上的每个人都深信自己看到了世界尽头阿斯兰的国度。

就在这时，嘎吱一声，船搁浅了。现在水已经太浅了。“就从这儿，”雷佩契普说，“我要一个人继续前进了。”

没有人试图去阻拦他，因为一切都像是命运的安排，或者是曾经发生过一样。他们帮他把小艇放在水面上。然后他放下了自己的剑（他说：“我用不着了。”），远远地把它扔向了百合花盛开的海那边。那把剑落下水，笔直地插在那儿，只有剑柄还露在水面上。他和他们告别的时候努力装出为他们难过的样子，但其实他高兴得都要发抖了。露西第一次也是最后一次做了她一直想做的事，把他抱在怀里爱抚了一阵。然后他迫不及待地坐进了自己的小艇，拿起船桨，顺着水流漂走了，在百合花丛的衬托下显得黑黑的。但是海浪上没有百合花，而是一个光滑的绿色坡面。小艇航行得越来越快，顺利地冲上了海浪的坡面。刹那间，他们看见了小船的轮廓和坐在上面的雷佩契普的轮廓。然后他们马上就不见了，从此以后再没有人敢真正自称看见过老鼠雷佩契普。但是我相信他平安地到达了阿斯兰的国度，一直活到了现在。

太阳升起的时候，世界外面的山渐渐消失了。波浪还在，但它后面只剩下了蓝天。

孩子们下了船，蹚着水走——他们不是走向海浪，而是往南走，左边是水墙。他们没法告诉你为什么要这么做，这是他们的命运。虽然他们在黎明踏浪号上已经感觉到自己长大了，他们也确实长大了，但现在他们的感觉却恰恰相反，他们相互手拉着手穿过百合花丛。他们一点儿也不觉得累。海水很温暖，而且越来越浅。最后，他们来到了干沙地上，接着又来到了草地上，那是一大片又细又短的草，几乎和银海一样高，往四面八方铺开，连个鼹鼠丘都没有。

当然，就像在一块没有树木的平地上一样，看起来天空好像在他们眼前和草地相接。但是，他们往前走去，却有了一个最离奇的印象：在这里，天空好像真的和地面连接在一起了。那像是一堵蓝色的墙，非常明亮，但是真实而坚固，像极了玻璃。很快他们就确定了。他们现在已经离它很近了。

但是在他们和天空之间的草地上，有一个白色的东西，即使他们的眼睛已经像鹰一样厉害，也没法盯着它看。他们走近一看，发现是一只小羊。

“来吃早饭吧。”小羊奶声奶气地说。

他们这才注意到草地上有火，上面烤着鱼。他们坐下来吃鱼，这是这么多天以来他们第一次觉得饿。这是他们吃过的最美味的食物。

“小羊，请你告诉我，”露西说，“这条路能去阿斯兰的国度吗？”

“这条路不是给你们走的，”小羊说，“你们得从自己的世界到阿斯兰的国度去。”

“什么！”艾德蒙说，“从我们的世界能到阿斯兰的国度吗？”

“所有的世界都能通到我的国度。”小羊说。但是，他一边说着，雪白的毛发就变成了金褐色，他的身形也变了。原来他就是阿斯兰，他高高地耸立着，鬃毛闪闪发光。

“啊，是阿斯兰，”露西说，“你能告诉我们怎样从我们的世界进入你的国度吗？”

“我将不断告诉你，”阿斯兰说，“但我不会告诉你这条路有多长，只能告诉你这条路横跨了一条河。但是不要害怕，因为我是个厉害的造桥人。现在过来吧，我会打开天空的门，把你们送回家。”

“阿斯兰，”露西说，“在我们走之前，你能不能告诉我，我们什么时候能再回到纳尼亚来？求你了。对了，请你一定、一定、一定让这一天快点儿到来啊。”

“亲爱的，”阿斯兰温柔地说，“你和你哥哥永远不会回到纳尼亚来了。”

“啊，阿斯兰！”艾德蒙和露西都绝望地说。

“孩子们，你们已经长大了，”阿斯兰说，“你们现在必须得回到自己的世界了。”

“你知道的，不是纳尼亚，”露西抽泣着说，“而是你。我们在那里见不到你。要是永远见不到你，我们该怎么活？”

“但是你会见到我的，亲爱的。”阿斯兰说。

“难道……你也在那儿吗？”艾德蒙说。

“是的，”阿斯兰说，“但是我在那里有另一个名字。你们得学会知道我那个名字。你们在这里了解了我一点，到了那里就会了解我更多，这就是把你们带到纳尼亚的原因。”

“尤斯塔斯也不会回到这里来了吗？”露西说。

“孩子，”阿斯兰说，“你真的需要知道吗？来吧，我要打开天空的门了。”刹那间，蓝色的墙开了一道裂缝（就像窗帘被拉开一样），天外射来一束耀眼的白光，他们摸到了阿斯兰的鬃毛，感受到狮子在亲吻他们的额头，转眼间却发现自己已经回到了剑桥艾伯塔姨妈家的卧室里。

还有两件事需要说明一下。第一件事是凯斯宾和他的手下都安全回到了拉曼杜所在的岛上。三位勋爵从沉睡中醒了过来。凯斯宾娶了拉曼杜的女儿，最后他们都回到了纳尼亚。她成了伟大的王后，当了母亲，又当了祖母，她的后人们成了伟大的国王。另一件事是，在我们的世界里，没过多久人人都开始说尤斯塔斯长进了不少，还有人说“你绝不会知道他原来是那样一个孩子”。只有艾伯塔姨妈说他变得普普通通，让人讨厌，一定是被佩文西家的孩子影响了。

CHAPTER ONE:

THE PICTURE IN THE BEDROOM


THERE was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it. His parents called him Eustace Clarence and masters called him Scrubb. I can’t tell you how his friends spoke to him, for he had none. He didn’t call his Father and Mother “Father” and “Mother,” but Harold and Alberta. They were very up-to-date and advanced people. They were vegetarians, non-smokers and teetotallers and wore a special kind of underclothes. In their house there was very little furniture and very few clothes on beds and the windows were always open.

Eustace Clarence liked animals, especially beetles, if they were dead and pinned on a card. He liked books if they were books of information and had pictures of grain elevators or of fat foreign children doing exercises in model schools.

Eustace Clarence disliked his cousins the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. But he was quite glad when he heard that Edmund and Lucy were coming to stay. For deep down inside him he liked bossing and bullying; and, though he was a puny little person who couldn’t have stood up even to Lucy, let alone Edmund, in a fight, he knew that there are dozens of ways to give people a bad time if you are in your own home and they are only visitors.

Edmund and Lucy did not at all want to come and stay with Uncle Harold and Aunt Alberta. But it really couldn’t be helped. Father had got a job lecturing in America for sixteen weeks that summer, and Mother was to go with him because she hadn’t had a real holiday for ten years. Peter was working very hard for an exam and he was to spend the holidays being coached by old Professor Kirke in whose house these four children had had wonderful adventures long ago in the war years. If he had still been in that house he would have had them all to stay. But he had somehow become poor since the old days and was living in a small cottage with only one bedroom to spare. It would have cost too much money to take the other three all to America, and Susan had gone.

Grown-ups thought her the pretty one of the family and she was no good at school work（though otherwise very old for her age）and Mother said she “would get far more out of a trip to America than the youngsters.” Edmund and Lucy tried not to grudge Susan her luck, but it was dreadful having to spend the summer holidays at their Aunt’s. “But it’s far worse for me,” said Edmund, “because you’ll at least have a room of your own and I shall have to share a bedroom with that record stinker, Eustace.”

The story begins on an afternoon when Edmund and Lucy were stealing a few precious minutes alone together. And of course they were talking about Narnia, which was the name of their own private and secret country. Most of us, I suppose, have a secret country but for most of us it is only an imaginary country. Edmund and Lucy were luckier than other people in that respect. Their secret country was real. They had already visited it twice; not in a game or a dream but in reality. They had got there of course by Magic, which is the only way of getting to Narnia. And a promise, or very nearly a promise, had been made them in Narnia itself that they would some day get back. You may imagine that they talked about it a good deal, when they got the chance.

They were in Lucy’s room, sitting on the edge of her bed and looking at a picture on the opposite wall. It was the only picture in the house that they liked. Aunt Alberta didn’t like it at all（that was why it was put away in a little back room upstairs）, but she couldn’t get rid of it because it had been a wedding present from someone she did not want to offend.

It was a picture of a ship—a ship sailing straight towards you. Her prow was gilded and shaped like the head of a dragon with wide-open mouth. She had only one mast and one large, square sail which was a rich purple. The sides of the ship—what you could see of them where the gilded wings of the dragon ended—were green. She had just run up to the top of one glorious blue wave, and the nearer slope of that wave came down towards you, with streaks and bubbles on it. She was obviously running fast before a gay wind, listing over a little on her port side. （By the way, if you are going to read this story at all, and if you don’t know already, you had better get it into your head that the left of a ship when you are looking ahead, is port, and the right is starboard.）All the sunlight fell on her from that side, and the water on that side was full of greens and purples. On the other, it was darker blue from the shadow of the ship.

“The question is,” said Edmund, “whether it doesn’t make things worse, looking at a Narnian ship when you can’t get there.”

“Even looking is better than nothing,” said Lucy. “And she is such a very Narnian ship.”

“Still playing your old game?” said Eustace Clarence, who had been listening outside the door and now came grinning into the room. Last year, when he had been staying with the Pevensies, he had managed to hear them all talking of Narnia and he loved teasing them about it. He thought of course that they were making it all up; and as he was far too stupid to make anything up himself, he did not approve of that.

“You’re not wanted here,” said Edmund curtly.

“I’m trying to think of a limerick,” said Eustace. “Something like this:

“Some kids who played games about Narnia

Got gradually balmier and balmier—”

“Well Narnia and balmier don’t rhyme, to begin with,” said Lucy.

“It’s an assonance,” said Eustace.

“Don’t ask him what an assy-thingummy is,” said Edmund. “He’s only longing to be asked. Say nothing and perhaps he’ll go away.”

Most boys, on meeting a reception like this, would either have cleared out or flared up. Eustace did neither. He just hung about grinning, and presently began talking again.

“Do you like that picture?” he asked.

“For heaven’s sake don’t let him get started about Art and all that,” said Edmund hurriedly, but Lucy, who was very truthful, had already said,“Yes, I do. I like it very much.”

“It’s a rotten picture,” said Eustace.

“You won’t see it if you step outside,” said Edmund.

“Why do you like it?” said Eustace to Lucy.

“Well, for one thing,” said Lucy, “I like it because the ship looks as if it was really moving. And the water looks as if it was really wet. And the waves look as if they were really going up and down.”

Of course Eustace knew lots of answers to this, but he didn’t say anything. The reason was that at that very moment he looked at the waves and saw that they did look very much indeed as if they were going up and down. He had only once been in a ship（and then only as far as the Isle of Wight）and had been horribly seasick. The look of the waves in the picture made him feel sick again. He turned rather green and tried another look. And then all three children were staring with open mouths.

What they were seeing may be hard to believe when you read it in print, but it was almost as hard to believe when you saw it happening. The things in the picture were moving. It didn’t look at all like a cinema either; the colours were too real and clean and out-of-doors for that. Down went the prow of the ship into the wave and up went a great shock of spray. And then up went the wave behind her, and her stern and her deck became visible for the first time, and then disappeared as the next wave came to meet her and her bows went up again. At the same moment an exercise book which had been lying beside Edmund on the bed flapped, rose and sailed through the air to the wall behind him, and Lucy felt all her hair whipping round her face as it does on a windy day. And this was a windy day; but the wind was blowing out of the picture towards them. And suddenly with the wind came the noises—the swishing of waves and the slap of water against the ship’s sides and the creaking and the overall high steady roar of air and water. But it was the smell, the wild, briny smell, which really convinced Lucy that she was not dreaming.

“Stop it,” came Eustace’s voice, squeaky with fright and bad temper.“It’s some silly trick you two are playing. Stop it. I’ll tell Alberta—Ow!”

The other two were much more accustomed to adventures, but, just exactly as Eustace Clarence said “Ow,” they both said “Ow” too. The reason was that a great cold, salt splash had broken right out of the frame and they were breathless from the smack of it, besides being wet through.

“I’ll smash the rotten thing,” cried Eustace; and then several things happened at the same time. Eustace rushed towards the picture. Edmund,who knew something about magic, sprang after him, warning him to look out and not to be a fool. Lucy grabbed at him from the other side and was dragged forward. And by this time either they had grown much smaller or the picture had grown bigger. Eustace jumped to try to pull it off the wall and found himself standing on the frame; in front of him was not glass but real sea, and wind and waves rushing up to the frame as they might to a rock. He lost his head and clutched at the other two who had jumped up beside him. There was a second of struggling and shouting, and just as they thought they had got their balance a great blue roller surged up round them, swept them off their feet, and drew them down into the sea. Eustace’s despairing cry suddenly ended as the water got into his mouth.

Lucy thanked her stars that she had worked hard at her swimming last summer term. It is true that she would have got on much better if she had used a slower stroke, and also that the water felt a great deal colder than it had looked while it was only a picture. Still, she kept her head and kicked her shoes off, as everyone ought to do who falls into deep water in their clothes. She even kept her mouth shut and her eyes open. They were still quite near the ship; she saw its green side towering high above them, and people looking at her from the deck. Then, as one might have expected, Eustace clutched at her in a panic and down they both went.

When they came up again she saw a white figure diving off the ship’s side. Edmund was close beside her now, treading water, and had caught the arms of the howling Eustace. Then someone else, whose face was vaguely familiar, slipped an arm under her from the other side. There was a lot of shouting going on from the ship, heads crowding together above the bulwarks, ropes being thrown. Edmund and the stranger were fastening ropes round her. After that followed what seemed a very long delay during which her face got blue and her teeth began chattering. In reality the delay was not very long; they were waiting till the moment when she could be got on board the ship without being dashed against its side. Even with all their best endeavours she had a bruised knee when she finally stood, dripping and shivering, on the deck. After her Edmund was heaved up, and then the miserable Eustace. Last of all came the stranger—a golden-headed boy some years older than herself.

“Ca—Ca—Caspian!” gasped Lucy as soon as she had breath enough. For Caspian it was; Caspian, the boy king of Narnia whom they had helped to set on the throne during their last visit. Immediately Edmund recognized him too. All three shook hands and clapped one another on the back with great delight.

“But who is your friend?” said Caspian almost at once, turning to Eustace with his cheerful smile. But Eustace was crying much harder than any boy of his age has a right to cry when nothing worse than a wetting has happened to him, and would only yell out, “Let me go. Let me go back. I don’t like it.”

“Let you go?” said Caspian. “But where?”

Eustace rushed to the ship’s side, as if he expected to see the picture frame hanging above the sea, and perhaps a glimpse of Lucy’s bedroom. What he saw was blue waves flecked with foam, and paler blue sky, both spreading without a break to the horizon. Perhaps we can hardly blame him if his heart sank. He was promptly sick.

“Hey! Rynelf,” said Caspian to one of the sailors. “Bring spiced wine for their Majesties. You’ll need something to warm you after that dip.” He called Edmund and Lucy their Majesties because they and Peter and Susan had all been Kings and Queens of Narnia long before his time. Narnian time flows differently from ours. If you spent a hundred years in Narnia, you would still come back to our world at the very same hour of the very same day on which you left. And then, if you went back to Narnia after spending a week here, you might find that a thousand Narnian years had passed, or only a day, or no time at all. You never know till you get there. Consequently, when the Pevensie children had returned to Narnia last time for their second visit, it was（for the Narnians）as if King Arthur came back to Britain, as some people say he will. And I say the sooner the better.

Rynelf returned with the spiced wine steaming in a flagon and four silver cups. It was just what one wanted, and as Lucy and Edmund sipped it they could feel the warmth going right down to their toes. But Eustace made faces and spluttered and spat it out and was sick again and began to cry again and asked if they hadn’t any Plumptree’s Vitaminized Nerve Food and could it be made with distilled water and anyway he insisted on being put ashore at the next station.

“This is a merry shipmate you’ve brought us, Brother,” whispered Caspian to Edmund with a chuckle; but before he could say anything more Eustace burst out again.

“Oh! Ugh! What on earth’s that! Take it away, the horrid thing.”

He really had some excuse this time for feeling a little surprised. Something very curious indeed had come out of the cabin in the poop and was slowly approaching them. You might call it—and indeed it was—a Mouse. But then it was a Mouse on its hind legs and stood about two feet high. A thin band of gold passed round its head under one ear and over the other and in this was stuck a long crimson feather. （As the Mouse’s fur was very dark, almost black, the effect was bold and striking.）Its left paw rested on the hilt of a sword very nearly as long as its tail. Its balance, as it paced gravely along the swaying deck, was perfect, and its manners courtly. Lucy and Edmund recognized it at once—Reepicheep, the most valiant of all the Talking Beasts of Narnia, and the Chief Mouse. It had won undying glory in the second Battle of Beruna. Lucy longed, as she had always done, to take Reepicheep up in her arms and cuddle him. But this, as she well knew, was a pleasure she could never have: it would have offended him deeply. Instead, she went down on one knee to talk to him.

Reepicheep put forward his left leg, drew back his right, bowed, kissed her hand, straightened himself, twirled his whiskers, and said in his shrill, piping voice:

“My humble duty to your Majesty. And to King Edmund, too.”（Here he bowed again.）“Nothing except your Majesties’ presence was lacking to this glorious venture.”

“Ugh, take it away,” wailed Eustace. “I hate mice. And I never could bear performing animals. They’re silly and vulgar and—and sentimental.”

“Am I to understand,” said Reepicheep to Lucy after a long stare at Eustace, “that this singularly discourteous person is under your Majesty’s protection? Because, if not—”

At this moment Lucy and Edmund both sneezed.

“What a fool I am to keep you all standing here in your wet things,” said Caspian. “Come on below and get changed. I’ll give you my cabin of course, Lucy, but I’m afraid we have no women’s clothes on board. You’ll have to make do with some of mine. Lead the way, Reepicheep, like a good fellow.”

“To the convenience of a lady,” said Reepicheep, “even a question of honour must give way—at least for the moment—” and here he looked very hard at Eustace. But Caspian hustled them on and in a few minutes Lucy found herself passing through the door into the stern cabin. She fell in love with it at once—the three square windows that looked out on the blue, swirling water astern, the low cushioned benches round three sides of the table, the swinging silver lamp overhead（Dwarfs’ work, she knew at once by its exquisite delicacy）and the flat gold image of Aslan the Lion on the forward wall above the door. All this she took in in a flash, for Caspian immediately opened a door on the starboard side, and said, “This’ll be your room, Lucy. I’ll just get some dry things for myself—” he was rummaging in one of the lockers while he spoke—“and then leave you to change. If you’ll fling your wet things outside the door I’ll get them taken to the galley to be dried.”

Lucy found herself as much at home as if she had been in Caspian’s cabin for weeks, and the motion of the ship did not worry her, for in the old days when she had been a queen in Narnia she had done a good deal of voyaging. The cabin was very tiny but bright with painted panels（all birds and beasts and crimson dragons and vines）and spotlessly clean. Caspian’s clothes were too big for her, but she could manage. His shoes, sandals and sea-boots were hopelessly big but she did not mind going barefoot on board ship. When she had finished dressing she looked out of her window at the water rushing past and took a long deep breath. She felt quite sure they were in for a lovely time.





CHAPTER TWO:

ON BOARD THE DAWN TREADER


“AH, there you are, Lucy,” said Caspian. “We were just waiting for you. This is my captain, the Lord Drinian.”

A dark-haired man went down on one knee and kissed her hand. The only others present were Reepicheep and Edmund.

“Where is Eustace?” asked Lucy.

“In bed,” said Edmund, “and I don’t think we can do anything for him. It only makes him worse if you try to be nice to him.”

“Meanwhile,” said Caspian, “we want to talk.”

“By Jove, we do,” said Edmund. “And first, about time. It’s a year ago by our time since we left you just before your coronation. How long has it been in Narnia?”

“Exactly three years,” said Caspian.

“All going well?” asked Edmund.

“You don’t suppose I’d have left my kingdom and put to sea unless all was well,” answered the King. “It couldn’t be better. There’s no trouble at all now between Telmarines, Dwarfs, Talking Beasts, Fauns and the rest. And we gave those troublesome giants on the frontier such a good beating last summer that they pay us tribute now. And I had an excellent person to leave as Regent while I’m away—Trumpkin, the Dwarf. You remember him?”

“Dear Trumpkin,” said Lucy, “of course I do. You couldn’t have made a better choice.”

“Loyal as a badger, Ma’am, and valiant as—as a Mouse,” said Drinian. He had been going to say “as a lion” but had noticed Reepicheep’s eyes fixed on him.

“And where are we heading for?” asked Edmund.

“Well,” said Caspian, “that’s rather a long story. Perhaps you remember that when I was a child my usurping uncle Miraz got rid of seven friends of my father’s（who might have taken my part）by sending them off to explore the unknown Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands.”

“Yes,” said Lucy, “and none of them ever came back.”

“Right. Well, on, my coronation day, with Aslan’s approval, I swore an oath that, if once I established peace in Narnia, I would sail east myself for a year and a day to find my father’s friends or to learn of their deaths and avenge them if I could. These were their names: the Lord Revilian, the Lord Bern, the Lord Argoz, the Lord Mavramorn, the Lord Octesian, the Lord Restimar, and—oh, that other one who’s so hard to remember.”

“The Lord Rhoop, Sire,” said Drinian.

“Rhoop, Rhoop, of course,” said Caspian. “That is my main intention. But Reepicheep here has an even higher hope.” Everyone’s eyes turned to the Mouse.

“As high as my spirit,” it said. “Though perhaps as small as my stature. Why should we not come to the very eastern end of the world? And what might we find there? I expect to find Aslan’s own country. It is always from the east, across the sea, that the great Lion comes to us.”

“I say, that is an idea,” said Edmund in an awed voice.

“But do you think,” said Lucy, “Aslan’s country would be that sort of country—I mean, the sort you could ever sail to?”

“I do not know, Madam,” said Reepicheep. “But there is this. When I was in my cradle a wood woman, a Dryad, spoke this verse over me:

“Where sky and water meet,

Where the waves grow sweet,

Doubt not, Reepicheep,

To find all you seek,

There is the utter East.”

“I do not know what it means. But the spell of it has been on me all my life.”

After a short silence Lucy asked, “And where are we now, Caspian?”

“The Captain can tell you better than I,” said Caspian, so Drinian got out his chart and spread it on the table.

“That’s our position,” he said, laying his finger on it. “Or was at noon today. We had a fair wind from Cair Paravel and stood a little north for Galma, which we made on the next day. We were in port for a week, for the Duke of Galma made a great tournament for His Majesty and there he unhorsed many knights—”

“And got a few nasty falls myself, Drinian. Some of the bruises are there still,” put in Caspian.

“—And unhorsed many knights,” repeated Drinian with a grin. “We thought the Duke would have been pleased if the King’s Majesty would have married his daughter, but nothing came of that—”

“Squints, and has freckles,” said Caspian.

“Oh, poor girl,” said Lucy.

“And we sailed from Galma,” continued Drinian, “and ran into a calm for the best part of two days and had to row, and then had wind again and did not make Terebinthia till the fourth day from Galma. And there their King sent out a warning not to land for there was sickness in Terebinthia, but we doubled the cape and put in at a little creek far from the city and watered. Then we had to lie off for three days before we got a southeast wind and stood out for Seven Isles. The third day out a pirate（Terebinthian by her rig）overhauled us, but when she saw us well armed she stood off after some shooting of arrows on either part—”

“And we ought to have given her chase and boarded her and hanged every mother’s son of them,” said Reepicheep.

“—And in five days more we were in sight of Muil, which, as you know, is the westernmost of the Seven Isles. Then we rowed through the straits and came about sundown into Redhaven on the isle of Brenn, where we were very lovingly feasted and had victuals and water at will. We left Redhaven six days ago and have made marvellously good speed, so that I hope to see the Lone Islands the day after tomorrow. The sum is, we are now nearly thirty days at sea and have sailed more than four hundred leagues from Narnia.”

“And after the Lone Islands?” said Lucy.

“No one knows, your Majesty,” answered Drinian. “Unless the Lone Islanders themselves can tell us.”

“They couldn’t in our days,” said Edmund.

“Then,” said Reepicheep, “it is after the Lone Islands that the adventure really begins.”

Caspian now suggested that they might like to be shown over the ship before supper, but Lucy’s conscience smote her and she said, “I think I really must go and see Eustace. Seasickness is horrid, you know. If I had my old cordial with me I could cure him.”

“But you have,” said Caspian. “I’d quite forgotten about it. As you left it behind I thought it might be regarded as one of the royal treasures and so I brought it—if you think it ought to be wasted on a thing like seasickness.”

“It’ll only take a drop,” said Lucy.

Caspian opened one of the lockers beneath the bench and brought out the beautiful little diamond flask which Lucy remembered so well. “Take back your own, Queen,” he said. They then left the cabin and went out into the sunshine.

In the deck there were two large, long hatches, fore and aft of the mast, and both open, as they always were in fair weather, to let light and air into the belly of the ship. Caspian led them down a ladder into the after hatch. Here they found themselves in a place where benches for rowing ran from side to side and the light came in through the oarholes and danced on the roof. Of course Caspian’s ship was not that horrible thing, a galley rowed by slaves. Oars were used only when wind failed or for getting in and out of harbour and everyone（except Reepicheep whose legs were too short）had often taken a turn. At each side of the ship the space under the benches was left clear for the rowers’ feet, but all down the centre there was a kind of pit which went down to the very keel and this was filled with all kinds of things—sacks of flour, casks of water and beer, barrels of pork, jars of honey, skin bottles of wine, apples, nuts, cheeses, biscuits, turnips, sides of bacon. From the roof—that is, from the under side of the deck—hung hams and strings of onions, and also the men of the watch off-duty in their hammocks. Caspian led them aft, stepping from bench to bench; at least, it was stepping for him, and something between a step and a jump for Lucy, and a real long jump for Reepicheep. In this way they came to a partition with a door in it. Caspian opened the door and led them into a cabin which filled the stern underneath the deck cabins in the poop. It was of course not so nice. It was very low and the sides sloped together as they went down so that there was hardly any floor; and though it had windows of thick glass, they were not made to open because they were under water. In fact at this very moment, as the ship pitched they were alternately golden with sunlight and dim green with the sea.

“You and I must lodge here, Edmund,” said Caspian. “We’ll leave your kinsman the bunk and sling hammocks for ourselves.”

“I beseech your Majesty—” said Drinian.

“No, no shipmate,” said Caspian, “we have argued all that out already. You and Rhince,”（Rhince was the mate）“are sailing the ship and will have cares and labours many a night when we are singing catches or telling stories, so you and he must have the port cabin above. King Edmund and I can lie very snug here below. But how is the stranger?”

Eustace, very green in the face, scowled and asked whether there was any sign of the storm getting less. But Caspian said, “What storm?” and Drinian burst out laughing.

“Storm, young master!” he roared. “This is as fair weather as a man could ask for.”

“Who’s that?” said Eustace irritably. “Send him away. His voice goes through my head.”

“I’ve brought you something that will make you feel better, Eustace,” said Lucy.

“Oh, go away and leave me alone,” growled Eustace. But he took a drop from her flask, and though he said it was beastly stuff（the smell in the cabin when she opened it was delicious）it is certain that his face came the right colour a few moments after he had swallowed it, and he must have felt better because, instead of wailing about the storm and his head,he began demanding to be put ashore and said that at the first port he would “lodge a disposition” against them all with the British Consul. But when Reepicheep asked what a disposition was and how you lodged it（Reepicheep thought it was some new way of arranging a single combat）Eustace could only reply, “Fancy not knowing that.” In the end they succeeded in convincing Eustace that they were already sailing as fast as they could towards the nearest land they knew, and that they had no more power of sending him back to Cambridge—which was where Uncle Harold lived—than of sending him to the moon. After that he sulkily agreed to put on the fresh clothes which had been put out for him and come on deck.

Caspian now showed them over the ship, though indeed they had seen most of it already. They went up on the forecastle and saw the lookout man standing on a little shelf inside the gilded dragon’s neck and peering through its open mouth. Inside the forecastle was the galley（or ship’s kitchen）and quarters for such people as the boatswain, the carpenter, the cook and the master-archer. If you think it odd to have the galley in the bows and imagine the smoke from its chimney streaming back over the ship, that is because you are thinking of steamships where there is always a headwind. On a sailing ship the wind is coming from behind, and anything smelly is put as far forward as possible. They were taken up to the fighting-top, and at first it was rather alarming to rock to and fro there and see the deck looking small and far away beneath. You realized that if you fell there was no particular reason why you should fall on board rather than in the sea. Then they were taken to the poop, where Rhince was on duty with another man at the great tiller, and behind that the dragon’s tail rose up, covered with gilding, and round inside it ran a little bench. The name of the ship was Dawn Treader. She was only a little bit of a thing compared with one of our ships, or even with the cogs, dromonds, carracks and galleons which Narnia had owned when Lucy and Edmund had reigned there under Peter as the High King, for nearly all navigation had died out in the reigns of Caspian’s ancestors. When his uncle, Miraz the usurper, had sent the seven lords to sea, they had had to buy a Galmian ship and man it with hired Galmian sailors. But now Caspian had begun to teach the Narnians to be sea-faring folk once more, and the Dawn Treader was the finest ship he had built yet. She was so small that, forward of the mast, there was hardly any deck room between the central hatch and the ship’s boat on one side and the hen-coop（Lucy fed the hens）on the other. But she was a beauty of her kind, a “lady” as sailors say, her lines perfect, her colours pure, and every spar and rope and pin lovingly made. Eustace of course would be pleased with nothing, and kept on boasting about liners and motorboats and aeroplanes and submarines（“As if he knew anything about them,” muttered Edmund）, but the other two were delighted with the Dawn Treader, and when they returned aft to the cabin and supper, and saw the whole western sky lit up with an immense crimson sunset, and felt the quiver of the ship, and tasted the salt on their lips, and thought of unlands on the Eastern rim of the world, Lucy felt that she was almost too happy to speak.

What Eustace thought had best be told in his own words, for when they all got their clothes back, dried, next morning, he at once got out a little black notebook and a pencil and started to keep a diary. He always had this notebook with him and kept a record of his marks in it, for though he didn’t care much about any subject for its own sake, he cared a great deal about marks and would even go to people and say, “I got so much. What did you get?” But as he didn’t seem likely to get many marks on the Dawn Treader he now started a diary. This was the first entry.

“August 7th. Have now been twenty-four hours on this ghastly boat if it isn’t a dream. All the time a frightful storm has been raging（it’s a good thing I’m not seasick）. Huge waves keep coming in over the front and I have seen the boat nearly go under any number of times. All the others pretend to take no notice of this, either from swank or because Harold says one of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes to Facts. It’s madness to come out into the sea in a rotten little thing like this. Not much bigger than a lifeboat. And, of course, absolutely primitive indoors. No proper saloon, no radio, no bathrooms, no deckchairs. I was dragged all over it yesterday evening and it would make anyone sick to hear Caspian showing off his funny little toy boat as if it was the Queen Mary. I tried to tell him what real ships are like, but he’s too dense. E. and L., of course, didn’t back me up. I suppose a kid like L. doesn’t realize the danger and E. is buttering up C. as everyone does here. They call him a King. I said I was a Republican but he had to ask me what that meant! He doesn’t seem to know anything at all. Needless to say I’ve been put in the worst cabin of the boat, a perfect dungeon, and Lucy has been given a whole room on deck to herself, almost a nice room compared with the rest of this place. C. says that’s because she’s a girl. I tried to make him see what Alberta says, that all that sort of thing is really lowering girls but he was too dense. Still, he might see that I shall be ill if I’m kept in that hole any longer. E. says we mustn’t grumble because C. is sharing it with us himself to make room for L. .As if that didn’t make it more crowded and far worse. Nearly forgot to say that there is also a kind of Mouse thing that gives everyone the most frightful cheek. The others can put up with it if they like but I shall twist his tail pretty soon if he tries it on me. The food is frightful too.”

The trouble between Eustace and Reepicheep arrived even sooner than might have been expected. Before dinner next day, when the others were sitting round the table waiting（being at sea gives one a magnificent appetite）, Eustace came rushing in, wringing his hand and shouting out:

“That little brute has half killed me. I insist on it being kept under control. I could bring an action against you, Caspian. I could order you to have it destroyed.”

At the same moment Reepicheep appeared. His sword was drawn and his whiskers looked very fierce but he was as polite as ever.

“I ask your pardons all,” he said, “and especially her Majesty’s. If I had known that he would take refuge here I would have awaited a more reasonable time for his correction.”

“What on earth’s up?” asked Edmund.

What had really happened was this. Reepicheep, who never felt that the ship was getting on fast enough, loved to sit on the bulwarks far forward just beside the dragon’s head, gazing out at the eastern horizon and singing softly in his little chirruping voice the song the Dryad had made for him. He never held on to anything, however the ship pitched, and kept his balance with perfect ease; perhaps his long tail, hanging down to the deck inside the bulwarks, made this easier. Everyone on board was familiar with this habit, and the sailors liked it because when one was on look-out duty it gave one somebody to talk to. Why exactly Eustace had slipped and reeled and stumbled all the way forward to the forecastle（he had not yet got his sea-legs）I never heard. Perhaps he hoped he would see land, or perhaps he wanted to hang about the galley and scrounge something. Anyway, as soon as he saw that long tail hanging down—and perhaps it was rather tempting—he thought it would be delightful to catch hold of it, swing Reepicheep round by it once or twice upside-down,then run away and laugh. At first the plan seemed to work beautifully. The Mouse was not much heavier than a very large cat. Eustace had him off the rail in a trice and very silly he looked（thought Eustace）with his little limbs all splayed out and his mouth open. But unfortunately Reepicheep, who had fought for his life many a time, never lost his head even for a moment. Nor his skill. It is not very easy to draw one’s sword when one is swinging round in the air by one’s tail, but he did. And the next thing Eustace knew was two agonizing jabs in his hand which made him let go of the tail; and the next thing after that was that the Mouse had picked itself up again as if it were a ball bouncing off the deck, and there it was facing him, and a horrid long, bright, sharp thing like a skewer was waving to and fro within an inch of his stomach.（This doesn’t count as below the belt for mice in Narnia because they can hardly be expected to reach higher.）

“Stop it,” spluttered Eustace, “go away. Put that thing away. It’s not safe. Stop it, I say. I’ll tell Caspian. I’ll have you muzzled and tied up.”

“Why do you not draw your own sword, poltroon!” cheeped the Mouse. “Draw and fight or I’ll beat you black and blue with the flat.”

“I haven’t got one,” said Eustace. “I’m a pacifist. I don’t believe in fighting.”

“Do I understand,” said Reepicheep, withdrawing his sword for a moment and speaking very sternly, “that you do not intend to give me satisfaction?”

“I don’t know what you mean,” said Eustace, nursing his hand. “If you don’t know how to take a joke I shan’t bother my head about you.”

“Then take that,” said Reepicheep, “and that—to teach you manners—and the respect due to a knight—and a Mouse—and a Mouse’s tail—” and at each word he gave Eustace a blow with the side of his rapier, which was thin, fine dwarf-tempered steel and as supple and effective as a birch rod. Eustace（of course）was at a school where they didn’t have corporal punishment, so the sensation was quite new to him. That was why, in spite of having no sea-legs, it took him less than a minute to get off that forecastle and cover the whole length of the deck and burst in at the cabin door—still hotly pursued by Reepicheep. Indeed it seemed to Eustace that the rapier as well as the pursuit was hot. It might have been red-hot by the feel.

There was not much difficulty in settling the matter once Eustace realized that everyone took the idea of a duel seriously and heard Caspian offering to lend him a sword, and Drinian and Edmund discussing whether he ought to be handicapped in some way to make up for his being so much bigger than Reepicheep. He apologized sulkily and went off with Lucy to have his hand bathed and bandaged and then went to his bunk. He was careful to lie on his side.





CHAPTER THREE:

THE LONE ISLANDS


“LAND in sight,” shouted the man in the bows.

Lucy, who had been talking to Rhince on the poop, came pattering down the ladder and raced forward. As she went she was joined by Edmund, and they found Caspian, Drinian and Reepicheep already on the forecastle. It was a coldish morning, the sky very pale and the sea very dark blue with little white caps of foam, and there, a little way off on the starboard bow, was the nearest of the Lone Islands, Felimath, like a low green hill in the sea, and behind it, further off, the grey slopes of its sister Doorn.

“Same old Felimath! Same old Doorn,” said Lucy, clapping her hands. “Oh—Edmund, how long it is since you and I saw them last!”

“I’ve never understood why they belong to Narnia,” said Caspian.“Did Peter the High King conquer them?”

“Oh no,” said Edmund. “They were Narnian before our time—in the days of the White Witch.”

（By the way, I have never yet heard how these remote islands became attached to the crown of Narnia; if I ever do, and if the story is at all interesting, I may put it in some other book.）

“Are we to put in here, Sire?” asked Drinian.

“1 shouldn’t think it would be much good landing on Felimath,” said Edmund. “It was almost uninhabited in our days and it looks as if it was the same still. The people lived mostly on Doorn and a little on Avra—that’s the third one; you can’t see it yet. They only kept sheep on Felimath.”

“Then we’ll have to double that cape, I suppose,” said Drinian, “and land on Doorn. That’ll mean rowing.”

“I’m sorry we’re not landing on Felimath,” said Lucy. “I’d like to walk there again. It was so lonely—a nice kind of loneliness, and all grass and clover and soft sea air.”

“I’d love to stretch my legs too,” said Caspian. “I tell you what. Why shouldn’t we go ashore in the boat and send it back, and then we could walk across Felimath and let the Dawn Treader pick us up on the other side?”

If Caspian had been as experienced then as he became later on in this voyage he would not have made this suggestion; but at the moment it seemed an excellent one. “Oh do let’s,” said Lucy.

“You’ll come, will you?” said Caspian to Eustace, who had come on deck with his hand bandaged.

“Anything to get off this blasted boat,” said Eustace.

“Blasted?” said Drinian. “How do you mean?”

“In a civilized country like where I come from,” said Eustace, “the ships are so big that when you’re inside you wouldn’t know you were at sea at all.”

“In that case you might just as well stay ashore,” said Caspian. “Will you tell them to lower the boat, Drinian?”

The King, the Mouse, the two Pevensies, and Eustace all got into the boat and were pulled to the beach of Felimath. When the boat had left them and was being rowed back they all turned and looked round. They were surprised at how small the Dawn Treader looked.

Lucy was of course barefoot, having kicked off her shoes while swimming, but that is no hardship if one is going to walk on downy turf. It was delightful to be ashore again and to smell the earth and grass, even if at first the ground seemed to be pitching up and down like a ship, as it usually does for a while if one has been at sea. It was much warmer here than it had been on board and Lucy found the sand pleasant to her feet as they crossed it. There was a lark singing.

They struck inland and up a fairly steep, though low, hill. At the top of course they looked back, and there was the Dawn Treader shining like a great bright insect and crawling slowly north-westward with her oars. Then they went over the ridge and could see her no longer.

Doorn now lay before them, divided from Felimath by a channel about a mile wide; behind it and to the left lay Avra. The little white town of Narrowhaven on Doorn was easily seen.

“Hullo! What’s this?” said Edmund suddenly.

In the green valley to which they were descending six or seven rough-looking men, all armed, were sitting by a tree.

“Don’t tell them who we are,” said Caspian.

“And pray, your Majesty, why not?” said Reepicheep who had consented to ride on Lucy’s shoulder.

“It just occurred to me,” replied Caspian, “that no one here can have heard from Narnia for a long time. It’s just possible they may not still acknowledge our over-lordship. In which case it might not be quite safe to be known as the King.”

“We have our swords, Sire,” said Reepicheep.

“Yes, Reep, I know we have,” said Caspian. “But if it is a question of re-conquering the three islands, I’d prefer to come back with a rather larger army.”

By this time they were quite close to the strangers, one of whom—a big black-haired fellow—shouted out, “A good morning to you.”

“And a good morning to you,” said Caspian. “Is there still a Governor of the Lone Islands?”

“To be sure there is,” said the man, “Governor Gumpas. His Sufficiency is at Narrowhaven. But you’ll stay and drink with us.”

Caspian thanked him, though neither he nor the others much liked the look of their new acquaintance, and all of them sat down. But hardly had they raised their cups to their lips when the black-haired man nodded to his companions and, as quick as lightning, all the five visitors found themselves wrapped in strong arms. There was a moment’s struggle but all the advantages were on one side, and soon everyone was disarmed and had their hands tied behind their backs—except Reepicheep, writhing in his captor’s grip and biting furiously.

“Careful with that beast, Tacks,” said the Leader. “Don’t damage him. He’ll fetch the best price of the lot, I shouldn’t wonder.”

“Coward! Poltroon!” squeaked Reepicheep. “Give me my sword and free my paws if you dare.”

“Whew!” whistled the slave merchant（for that is what he was）.“It can talk! Well I never did. Blowed if I take less than two hundred crescents for him.” The Calormen crescent, which is the chief coin in those parts, is worth about a third of a pound.

“So that’s what you are,” said Caspian. “A kidnapper and slaver. I hope you’re proud of it.”

“Now, now, now, now,” said the slaver. “Don’t you start any jaw. The easier you take it, the pleasanter all round, see? I don’t do this for fun. I’ve got my living to make same as anyone else.”

“Where will you take us?” asked Lucy, getting the words out with some difficulty.

“Over to Narrowhaven,” said the slaver. “For market day tomorrow.”

“Is there a British Consul there?” asked Eustace.

“Is there a which?” said the man.

But long before Eustace was tired of trying to explain, the slaver simply said, “Well, I’ve had enough of this jabber. The Mouse is a fair treat but this one would talk the hind leg off a donkey. Off we go, mates.”

Then the four human prisoners were roped together, not cruelly but securely, and made to march down to the shore. Reepicheep was carried. He had stopped biting on a threat of having his mouth tied up, but he had a great deal to say, and Lucy really wondered how any man could bear to have the things said to him which were said to the slave dealer by the Mouse. But the slave dealer, far from objecting, only said “Go on” whenever Reepicheep paused for breath, occasionally adding, “It’s as good as a play,” or, “Blimey, you can’t help almost thinking it knows what it’s saying!” or “Was it one of you what trained it?” This so infuriated Reepicheep that in the end the number of things he thought of saying all at once nearly suffocated him and he became silent.

When they got down to the shore that looked towards Doorn they found a little village and a long-boat on the beach and, lying a little further out, a dirty bedraggled looking ship.

“Now, youngsters,” said the slave dealer, “let’s have no fuss and then you’ll have nothing to cry about. All aboard.”

At that moment a fine-looking bearded man came out of one of the houses（an inn, I think）and said:

“Well, Pug. More of your usual wares?”

The slaver, whose name seemed to be Pug, bowed very low, and said in a wheedling kind of voice, “Yes, please your Lordship.”

“How much do you want for that boy?” asked the other, pointing to Caspian.

“Ah,” said Pug, “I knew your Lordship would pick on the best. No deceiving your Lordship with anything second rate. That boy, now, I’ve taken a fancy to him myself. Got kind of fond of him, I have. I’m that tender-hearted I didn’t ever ought to have taken up this job. Still, to a customer like your Lordship—”

“Tell me your price, carrion,” said the Lord sternly. “Do you think I want to listen to the rigmarole of your filthy trade?”

“Three hundred crescents, my Lord, to your honourable Lordship, but to anyone else—”

“I’ll give you a hundred and fifty.”

“Oh please, please,” broke in Lucy. “Don’t separate us, whatever you do. You don’t know—” But then she stopped for she saw that Caspian didn’t even now want to be known.

“A hundred and fifty, then,” said the Lord. “As for you, little maiden, I am sorry I cannot buy you all. Unrope my boy, Pug. And look—treat these others well while they are in your hands or it’ll be the worse for you.”

“Well!” said Pug. “Now who ever heard of a gentleman in my way of business who treated his stock better than what I do? Well? Why, I treat ’em like my own children.”

“That’s likely enough to be true,” said the other grimly.

The dreadful moment had now come. Caspian was untied and his new master said, “This way, lad,” and Lucy burst into tears and Edmund looked very blank. But Caspian looked over his shoulder and said, “Cheer up. I’m sure it will come all right in the end. So long.”

“Now, missie,” said Pug. “Don’t you start taking on and spoiling your looks for the market tomorrow. You be a good girl and then you won’t have nothing to cry about, see?”

Then they were rowed out to the slave-ship and taken below into a long, rather dark place, none too clean, where they found many other unfortunate prisoners; for Pug was of course a pirate and had just returned from cruising among the islands and capturing what he could. The children didn’t meet anyone whom they knew; the prisoners were mostly Galmians and Terebinthians. And there they sat in the straw and wondered what was happening to Caspian and tried to stop Eustace talking as if everyone except himself was to blame.

Meanwhile Caspian was having a much more interesting time. The man who had bought him led him down a little lane between two of the village houses and so out into an open place behind the village. Then he turned and faced him.

“You needn’t be afraid of me, boy,” he said. “I’ll treat you well. I bought you for your face. You reminded me of someone.”

“May I ask of whom, my Lord?” said Caspian.

“You remind me of my master, King Caspian of Narnia.”

Then Caspian decided to risk everything on one stroke.

“My Lord,” he said, “I am your master. I am Caspian, King of Narnia.”

“You make very free,” said the other. “How shall I know this is true?”

“Firstly by my face,” said Caspian. “Secondly because I know within six guesses who you are. You are one of those seven lords of Narnia whom my Uncle Miraz sent to sea and whom I have come out to look for—Argoz, Bern, Octesian, Restimar, Mavramorn, or—or—I have forgotten the others. And finally, if your Lordship will give me a sword I will prove on any man’s body in clean battle that I am Caspian the son of Caspian, lawful King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel, and Emperor of the Lone Islands.”

“By heaven,” exclaimed the man, “it is his father’s very voice and trick of speech. My liege—your Majesty—” And there in the field he knelt and kissed the King’s hand.

“The moneys your Lordship disbursed for our person will be made good from our own treasury,” said Caspian.

“They’re not in Pug’s purse yet, Sire,” said the Lord Bern, for he it was. “And never will be, I trust. I have moved His Sufficiency the Governor a hundred times to crush this vile traffic in man’s flesh.”

“My Lord Bern,” said Caspian, “we must talk of the state of these Islands. But first what is your Lordship’s own story?”

“Short enough, Sire,” said Bern. “I came thus far with my six fellows, loved a girl of the islands, and felt I had had enough of the sea. And there was no purpose in returning to Narnia while your Majesty’s uncle held the reins. So I married and have lived here ever since.”

“And what is this governor, this Gumpas, like? Does he still acknowledge the King of Narnia for his lord?”

“In words, yes. All is done in the King’s name. But he would not be best pleased to find a real, live King of Narnia coming in upon him. And if your Majesty came before him alone and unarmed—well he would not deny his allegiance, but he would pretend to disbelieve you. Your Grace’s life would be in danger. What following has your Majesty in these waters?”

“There is my ship just rounding the point,” said Caspian. “We are about thirty swords if it came to fighting. Shall we not have my ship in and fall upon Pug and free my friends whom he holds captive?”

“Not by my counsel,” said Bern. “As soon as there was a fight two or three ships would put out from Narrowhaven to rescue Pug. Your Majesty must work by a show of more power than you really have, and by the terror of the King’s name. It must not come to plain battle. Gumpas is a chicken-hearted man and can be over-awed.”

After a little more conversation Caspian and Bern walked down to the coast a little west of the village and there Caspian winded his horn. （This was not the great magic horn of Narnia, Queen Susan’s Horn: he had left that at home for his regent Trumpkin to use if any great need fell upon the land in the King’s absence.）Drinian, who was on the lookout for a signal, recognized the royal horn at once and the Dawn Treader began standing in to shore. Then the boat put off again and in a few moments Caspian and the Lord Bern were on deck explaining the situation to Drinian. He, just like Caspian, wanted to lay the Dawn Treader alongside the slave-ship at once and board her, but Bern made the same objection.

“Steer straight down this channel, captain,” said Bern, “and then round to Avra where my own estates are. But first run up the King’s banner, hang out all the shields, and send as many men to the fighting top as you can. And about five bowshots hence, when you get open sea on your port bow, run up a few signals.”

“Signals? To whom?” said Drinian.

“Why, to all the other ships we haven’t got but which it might be well that Gumpas thinks we have.”

“Oh, I see,” said Drinian rubbing his hands. “And they’ll read our signals. What shall I say? Whole fleet round the South of Avra and assemble at—?”

“Bernstead,” said the Lord Bern. “That’ll do excellently. Their whole journey—if there were any ships—would be out of sight from Narrowhaven.”

Caspian was sorry for the others languishing in the hold of Pug’s slave-ship, but he could not help finding the rest of that day enjoyable. Late in the afternoon（for they had to do all by oar）, having turned to starboard round the northeast end of Doorn and port again round the point of Avra, they entered into a good harbour on Avra’s southern shore where Bern’s pleasant lands sloped down to the water’s edge. Bern’s people, many of whom they saw working in the fields, were all freemen and it was a happy and prosperous fief. Here they all went ashore and were royally feasted in a low, pillared house overlooking the bay. Bern and his gracious wife and merry daughters made them good cheer. But after dark Bern sent a messenger over by boat to Doorn to order some preparations（he did not say exactly what）for the following day.





CHAPTER FOUR:

WHAT CASPIAN DID THERE


NEXT morning the Lord Bern called his guests early, and after breakfast he asked Caspian to order every man he had into full armour.“And above all,” he added, “let everything be as trim and scoured as if it were the morning of the first battle in a great war between noble kings with all the world looking on.” This was done; and then in three boatloads Caspian and his people, and Bern with a few of his, put out for Narrowhaven. The King’s flag flew in the stern of his boat and his trumpeter was with him.

When they reached the jetty at Narrowhaven, Caspian found a considerable crowd assembled to meet them. “This is what I sent word about last night,” said Bern. “They are all friends of mine and honest people.” And as soon as Caspian stepped ashore the crowd broke out into hurrahs and shouts of, “Narnia! Narnia! Long live the King.” At the same moment—and this was also due to Bern’s messengers—bells began ringing from many parts of the town. Then Caspian caused his banner to be advanced and his trumpet to be blown and every man drew his sword and set his face into a joyful sternness, and they marched up the street so that the street shook, and their armour shone（for it was a sunny morning）so that one could hardly look at it steadily.

At first the only people who cheered were those who had been warned by Bern’s messenger and knew what was happening and wanted it to happen. But then all the children joined in because they liked a procession and had seen very few. And then all the schoolboys joined in because they also liked processions and felt that the more noise and disturbance there was the less likely they would be to have any school that morning. And then all the old women put their heads out of doors and windows and began chattering and cheering because it was a king, and what is a governor compared with that? And all the young women joined in for the same reason and also because Caspian and Drinian and the rest were so handsome. And then all the young men came to see what the young women were looking at, so that by the time Caspian reached the castle gates, nearly the whole town was shouting; and where Gumpas sat in the castle, muddling and messing about with accounts and forms and rules and regulations, he heard the noise.

At the castle gate Caspian’s trumpeter blew a blast and cried, “Open for the King of Narnia, come to visit his trusty and well-beloved servant the governor of the Lone Islands.” In those days everything in the islands was done in a slovenly, slouching manner. Only the little postern opened, and out came a tousled fellow with a dirty old hat on his head instead of a helmet, and a rusty old pike in his hand. He blinked at the flashing figures before him. “Carn—seez—fishansy,” he mumbled（which was his way of saying, “You can’t see His Sufficiency”）. “No interviews without ’pointments ’cept ’tween nine ’n’ ten p.m. second Saturday every month.”

“Uncover before Narnia, you dog,” thundered the Lord Bern, and dealt him a rap with his gauntleted hand which sent his hat flying from his head.

“’Ere? Wot’s it all about?” began the doorkeeper, but no one took any notice of him. Two of Caspian’s men stepped through the postern and after some struggling with bars and bolts（for everything was rusty）flung both wings of the gate wide open. Then the King and his followers strode into the courtyard. Here a number of the governor’s guards were lounging about and several more（they were mostly wiping their mouths）came tumbling out of various doorways. Though their armour was in a disgraceful condition, these were fellows who might have fought if they had been led or had known what was happening; so this was the dangerous moment. Caspian gave them no time to think.

“Where is the captain?” he asked.

“I am, more or less, if you know what I mean,” said a languid and rather dandified young person without any armour at all.

“It is our wish,” said Caspian, “that our royal visitation to our realm of the Lone Islands should, if possible, be an occasion of joy and not of terror to our loyal subjects. If it were not for that, I should have something to say about the state of your men’s armour and weapons. As it is, you are pardoned. Command a cask of wine to be opened that your men may drink our health. But at noon tomorrow I wish to see them here in this courtyard looking like men-at-arms and not like vagabonds. See to it on pain of our extreme displeasure.”

The captain gaped but Bern immediately cried, “Three cheers for the King,” and the soldiers, who had understood about the cask of wine even if they understood nothing else, joined in. Caspian then ordered most of his own men to remain in the courtyard. He, with Bern and Drinian and four others, went into the hall.

Behind a table at the far end with various secretaries about him sat his Sufficiency, the Governor of the Lone Islands. Gumpas was a bilious looking man with hair that had once been red and was now mostly grey.He glanced up as the strangers entered and then looked down at his papers saying automatically, “No interviews without appointments except between nine and ten p.m. on second Saturdays.”

Caspian nodded to Bern and then stood aside. Bern and Drinian took a step forward and each seized one end of the table. They lifted it, and flung it on one side of the hall where it rolled over, scattering a cascade of letters, dossiers, ink-pots, pens, sealing-wax and documents. Then, not roughly but as firmly as if their hands were pincers of steel, they plucked Gumpas out of his chair and deposited him, facing it, about four feet away. Caspian at once sat down in the chair and laid his naked sword across his knees.

“My Lord,” said he, fixing his eyes on Gumpas, “you have not given us quite the welcome we expected. We are the King of Narnia.”

“Nothing about it in the correspondence,” said the governor. “Nothing in the minutes. We have not been notified of any such thing. All irregular. Happy to consider any applications—”

“And we are come to inquire into your Sufficiency’s conduct of your office,” continued Caspian. “There are two points especially on which I require an explanation. Firstly I find no record that the tribute due from these Islands to the crown of Narnia has been received for about a hundred and fifty years.”

“That would be a question to raise at the Council next month,” said Gumpas. “If anyone moves that a commission of inquiry be set up to report on the financial history of the islands at the first meeting next year, why then …”

“I also find it very clearly written in our laws,” Caspian went on,“that if the tribute is not delivered the whole debt has to be paid by the Governor of the Lone Islands out of his private purse.”

At this Gumpas began to pay real attention. “Oh, that’s quite out of the question,” he said. “It is an economic impossibility—er—your Majesty must be joking.”

Inside, he was wondering if there were any way of getting rid of these unwelcome visitors. Had he known that Caspian had only one ship and one ship’s company with him, he would have spoken soft words for the moment, and hoped to have them all surrounded and killed during the night. But he had seen a ship of war sail down the straits yesterday and seen it signalling, as he supposed, to its consorts. He had not then known it was the King’s ship for there was not wind enough to spread the flag out and make the golden lion visible, so he had waited further developments. Now he imagined that Caspian had a whole fleet at Bernstead. It would never have occurred to Gumpas that anyone would walk into Narrowhaven to take the islands with less than fifty men; it was certainly not at all the kind of thing he could imagine doing himself.

“Secondly,” said Caspian, “I want to know why you have permitted this abominable and unnatural traffic in slaves to grow up here, contrary to the ancient custom and usage of our dominions.”

“Necessary, unavoidable,” said his Sufficiency. “An essential part of the economic development of the islands, I assure you. Our present burst of prosperity depends on it.”

“What need have you of slaves?”

“For export, your Majesty. Sell ’em to Calormen mostly; and we have other markets. We are a great centre of the trade.”

“In other words,” said Caspian, “you don’t need them. Tell me what purpose they serve except to put money into the pockets of such as Pug?”

“Your Majesty’s tender years,” said Gumpas, with what was meant to be a fatherly smile, “hardly make it possible that you should understand the economic problem involved. I have statistics, I have graphs, I have—”

“Tender as my years may be,” said Caspian, “I believe I understand the slave trade from within quite as well as your Sufficiency. And I do not see that it brings into the islands meat or bread or beer or wine or timber or cabbages or books or instruments of music or horses or armour or anything else worth having. But whether it does or not, it must be stopped.”

“But that would be putting the clock back,” gasped the governor.“Have you no idea of progress, of development?”

“I have seen them both in an egg,” said Caspian. “We call it ‘Going Bad’ in Narnia. This trade must stop.”

“I can take no responsibility for any such measure,” said Gumpas.

“Very well, then,” answered Caspian, “we relieve you of your office. My Lord Bern, come here.” And before Gumpas quite realized what was happening, Bern was kneeling with his hands between the King’s hands and taking the oath to govern the Lone Islands in accordance with the old customs, rights, usages and laws of Narnia. And Caspian said, “I think we have had enough of governors,” and made Bern a Duke, the Duke of the Lone Islands.

“As for you, my Lord,” he said to Gumpas, “I forgive you your debt for the tribute. But before noon tomorrow you and yours must be out of the castle, which is now the Duke’s residence.”

“Look here, this is all very well,” said one of Gumpas’s secretaries,“but suppose all you gentlemen stop play-acting and we do a little business. The question before us really is—”

“The question is,” said the Duke, “whether you and the rest of the rabble will leave without a flogging or with one. You may choose which you prefer.”

When all this had been pleasantly settled, Caspian ordered horses, of which there were a few in the castle, though very ill-groomed, and he, with Bern and Drinian and a few others, rode out into the town and made for the slave market. It was a long low building near the harbour and the scene which they found going on inside was very much like any other auction; that is to say, there was a great crowd and Pug, on a platform, was roaring out in a raucous voice:

“Now, gentlemen, lot twenty-three. Fine Terebinthian agricultural labourer, suitable for the mines or the galleys. Under twenty-five years of age. Not a bad tooth in his head. Good, brawny fellow. Take off his shirt, Tacks, and let the gentlemen see. There’s muscle for you! Look at the chest on him. Ten crescents from the gentleman in the corner. You must be joking, sir. Fifteen! Eighteen! Eighteen is bidden for lot twenty-three. Any advance on eighteen? Twenty-one. Thank you, sir. Twenty-one is bidden—”

But Pug stopped and gaped when he saw the mail-clad figures who had clanked up to the platform.

“On your knees, every man of you, to the King of Narnia,” said the Duke. Everyone heard the horses jingling and stamping outside and many had heard some rumour of the landing and the events at the castle. Most obeyed. Those who did not were pulled down by their neighbours. Some cheered.

“Your life is forfeit, Pug, for laying hands on our royal person yesterday,” said Caspian. “But your ignorance is pardoned. The slave trade was forbidden in all our dominions quarter of an hour ago. I declare every slave in this market free.”

He held up his hand to check the cheering of the slaves and went on,“Where are my friends?”

“That dear little gel and the nice young gentleman?” said Pug with an ingratiating smile. “Why, they were snapped up at once—”

“We’re here, we’re here, Caspian,” cried Lucy and Edmund together and, “At your service, Sire,” piped Reepicheep from another corner. They had all been sold but the men who had bought them were staying to bid for other slaves and so they had not yet been taken away. The crowd parted to let the three of them out and there was great hand-clasping and greeting between them and Caspian. Two merchants of Calormen at once approached. The Calormen have dark faces and long beards. They wear flowing robes and orange-coloured turbans, and they are a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel and ancient people. They bowed most politely to Caspian and paid him long compliments, all about the fountains of prosperity irrigating the gardens of prudence and virtue—and things like that—but of course what they wanted was the money they had paid.

“That is only fair, sirs,” said Caspian. “Every man who has bought a slave today must have his money back. Pug, bring out your takings to the last minim.”（A minim is the fortieth part of a crescent.）

“Does your good Majesty mean to beggar me?” whined Pug.

“You have lived on broken hearts all your life,” said Caspian, “and if you are beggared, it is better to be a beggar than a slave. But where is my other friend?”

“Oh him?” said Pug. “Oh take him and welcome. Glad to have him off my hands. I’ve never seen such a drug in the market in all my born days. Priced him at five crescents in the end and even so nobody’d have him. Threw him in free with other lots and still no one would have him. Wouldn’t touch him. Wouldn’t look at him. ‘Tacks, bring out Sulky.”

Thus Eustace was produced, and sulky he certainly looked; for though no one would want to be sold as a slave, it is perhaps even more galling to be a sort of utility slave whom no one will buy. He walked up to Caspian and said, “I see. As usual. Been enjoying yourself somewhere while the rest of us were prisoners. I suppose you haven’t even found out about the British Consul. Of course not.”

That night they had a great feast in the castle of Narrowhaven and then, “Tomorrow for the beginning of our real adventures!” said Reepicheep when he had made his bows to everyone and went to bed. But it could not really be tomorrow or anything like it. For now they were preparing to leave all known lands and seas behind them and the fullest preparations had to be made. The Dawn Treader was emptied and drawn on land by eight horses over rollers and every bit of her was gone over by the most skilled shipwrights. Then she was launched again and victualled and watered as full as she could hold—that is to say for twenty-eight days. Even this, as Edmund noticed with disappointment, only gave them a fortnight’s eastward sailing before they had to abandon their quest.

While all this was being done Caspian missed no chance of questioning all the oldest sea captains whom he could find in Narrowhaven to learn if they had any knowledge or even any rumours of land further to the east. He poured out many a flagon of the castle ale to weather-beaten men with short grey beards and clear blue eyes, and many a tall yarn he heard in return. But those who seemed the most truthful could tell of no lands beyond the Lone Islands, and many thought that if you sailed too far east you would come into the surges of a sea without lands that swirled perpetually round the rim of the world—“And that, I reckon, is where your Majesty’s friends went to the bottom.” The rest had only wild stories of islands inhabited by headless men, floating islands, waterspouts, and a fire that burned along the water. Only one, to Reepicheep’s delight, said,“And beyond that, Aslan’s country. But that’s beyond the end of the world and you can’t get there.” But when they questioned him he could only say that he’d heard it from his father.

Bern could only tell them that he had seen his six companions sail away eastward and that nothing had, ever been heard of them again. He said this when he and Caspian were standing on the highest point of Avra looking down on the eastern ocean. “I’ve often been up here of a morning,” said the Duke, “and seen the sun come up out of the sea, and sometimes it looked as if it were only a couple of miles away. And I’ve wondered about my friends and wondered what there really is behind that horizon. Nothing, most likely, yet I am always half ashamed that I stayed behind. But I wish your Majesty wouldn’t go. We may need your help here. This closing the slave market might make a new world; war with Calormen is what I foresee. My liege, think again.”

“I have an oath, my lord Duke,” said Caspian. “And anyway, what could I say to Reepicheep?”





CHAPTER FIVE:

THE STORM AND WHAT CAME OF IT


IT was nearly three weeks after their landing that the Dawn Treader was towed out of Narrowhaven harbour. Very solemn farewells had been spoken and a great crowd had assembled to see her departure. There had been cheers, and tears too, when Caspian made his last speech to the Lone Islanders and parted from the Duke and his family, but as the ship, her purple sail still flapping idly, drew further from the shore, and the sound of Caspian’s trumpet from the poop came fainter across the water, everyone became silent. Then she came into the wind. The sail swelled out, the tug cast off and began rowing back, the first real wave ran up under the Dawn Treader’s prow, and she was a live ship again. The men off duty went below, Drinian took the first watch on the poop, and she turned her head eastward round the south of Avra.

The next few days were delightful. Lucy thought she was the most fortunate girl in the world, as she woke each morning to see the reflections of the sunlit water dancing on the ceiling of her cabin and looked round on all the nice new things she had got in the Lone Islands—seaboots and buskins and cloaks and jerkins and scarves. And then she would go on deck and take a look from the forecastle at a sea which was a brighter blue each morning and drink in an air that was a little warmer day by day. After that came breakfast and such an appetite as one only has at sea.

She spent a good deal of time sitting on the little bench in the stern playing chess with Reepicheep. It was amusing to see him lifting the pieces, which were far too big for him, with both paws and standing on tiptoes if he made a move near the centre of the board. He was a good player and when he remembered what he was doing he usually won. But every now and then Lucy won because the Mouse did something quite ridiculous like sending a knight into the danger of a queen and castle combined. This happened because he had momentarily forgotten it was a game of chess and was thinking of a real battle and making the knight do what he would certainly have done in its place. For his mind was full of forlorn hopes, death-or-glory charges, and last stands.

But this pleasant time did not last. There came an evening when Lucy, gazing idly astern at the long furrow or wake they were leaving behind them, saw a great rack of clouds building itself up in the west with amazing speed. Then a gap was torn in it and a yellow sunset poured through the gap. All the waves behind them seemed to take on unusual shapes and the sea was a drab or yellowish colour like dirty canvas. The air grew cold. The ship seemed to move uneasily as if she felt danger behind her. The sail would be flat and limp one minute and wildly full the next. While she was noting these things and wondering at a sinister change which had come over the very noise of the wind, Drinian cried,“All hands on deck.” In a moment everyone became frantically busy. The hatches were battened down, the galley fire was put out, men went aloft to reef the sail. Before they had finished the storm struck them. It seemed to Lucy that a great valley in the sea opened just before their bows, and they rushed down into it, deeper down than she would have believed possible. A great grey hill of water, far higher than the mast, rushed to meet them;it looked certain death but they were tossed to the top of it. Then the ship seemed to spin round. A cataract of water poured over the deck; the poop and forecastle were like two islands with a fierce sea between them. Up aloft the sailors were lying out along the yard desperately trying to get control of the sail. A broken rope stood out sideways in the wind as straight and stiff as if it was poker.

“Get below, Ma’am,” bawled Drinian. And Lucy, knowing that landsmen—and landswomen—are a nuisance to the crew, began to obey. It was not easy. The Dawn Treader was listing terribly to starboard and the deck sloped like the roof of a house. She had to clamber round to the top of the ladder, holding on to the rail, and then stand by while two men climbed up it, and then get down it as best she could. It was well she was already holding on tight for at the foot of the ladder another wave roared across the deck, up to her shoulders. She was already almost wet through with spray and rain but this was colder. Then she made a dash for the cabin door and got in and shut out for a moment the appalling sight of the speed with which they were rushing into the dark, but not of course the horrible confusion of creakings, groanings, snappings, clatterings, roarings and boomings which only sounded more alarming below than they had done on the poop.

And all next day and all the next it went on. It went on till one could hardly even remember a time before it had begun. And there always had to be three men at the tiller and it was as much as three could do to keep any kind of a course. And there always had to be men at the pump. And there was hardly any rest for anyone, and nothing could be cooked and nothing could be dried, and one man was lost overboard, and they never saw the sun.

When it was over Eustace made the following entry in his diary:

“September 3. The first day for ages when I have been able to write. We had been driven before a hurricane for thirteen days and nights. I know that because I kept a careful count, though the others all say it was only twelve. Pleasant to be embarked on a dangerous voyage with people who can’t even count right! I have had a ghastly time, up and down enormous waves hour after hour, usually wet to the skin, and not even an attempt at giving us proper meals. Needless to say there’s no wireless or even a rocket, so no chance of signalling anyone for help. It all proves what I keep on telling them, the madness of setting out in a rotten little tub like this. It would be bad enough even if one was with decent people instead of fiends in human form. Caspian and Edmund are simply brutal to me. The night we lost our mast（there’s only a stump left now）, though I was not at all well, they forced me to come on deck and work like a slave. Lucy shoved her oar in by saying that Reepicheep was longing to go only he was too small. I wonder she doesn’t see that everything that little beast does is all for the sake of showing off. Even at her age she ought to have that amount of sense. Today the beastly boat is level at last and the sun’s out and we have all been jawing about what to do. We have food enough, pretty beastly stuff most of it, to last for sixteen days. （The poultry were all washed overboard. Even if they hadn’t been, the storm would have stopped them laying.）The real trouble is water. Two casks seem to have got a leak knocked in them and are empty.（Narnian efficiency again.）On short rations, half a pint a day each, we’ve got enough for twelve days.（There’s still lots of rum and wine but even they realize that would only make them thirstier.）

“If we could, of course, the sensible thing would be to turn west at once and make for the Lone Islands. But it took us eighteen days to get where we are, running like mad with a gale behind us. Even if we got an east wind it might take us far longer to get back. And at present there’s no sign of an east wind—in fact there’s no wind at all. As for rowing back, it would take far too long and Caspian says the men couldn’t row on half a pint of water a day. I’m pretty sure this is wrong. I tried to explain that perspiration really cools people down, so the men would need less water if they were working. He didn’t take any notice of this, which is always his way when he can’t think of an answer. The others all voted for going on in the hope of finding land. I felt it my duty to point out that we didn’t know there was any land ahead and tried to get them to see the dangers of wishful thinking. Instead of producing a better plan they had the cheek to ask me what I proposed. So I just explained coolly and quietly that I had been kidnapped and brought away on this idiotic voyage without my consent, and it was hardly my business to get them out of their scrape.

“September 4. Still becalmed. Very short rations for dinner and I got less than anyone. Caspian is very clever at helping and thinks I don’t see! Lucy for some reason tried to make up to me by offering me some of hers but that interfering prig Edmund wouldn’t let her. Pretty hot sun. Terribly thirsty all evening.

“September 5. Still becalmed and very hot. Feeling rotten all day and am sure I’ve got a temperature. Of course they haven’t the sense to keep a thermometer on board.

“September 6. A horrible day. Woke up in the night knowing I was feverish and must have a drink of water. Any doctor would have said so. Heaven knows I’m the last person to try to get any unfair advantage but I never dreamed that this water-rationing would be meant to apply to a sick man. In fact I would have woken the others up and asked for some only I thought it would be selfish to wake them. So I just got up and took my cup and tiptoed out of the Black Hole we slept in, taking great care not to disturb Caspian and Edmund, for they’ve been sleeping badly since the heat and the short water began. I always try to consider others whether they are nice to me or not. I got out all right into the big room, if you can call it a room, where the rowing benches and the luggage are. The thing of water is at this end. All was going beautifully, but before I’d drawn a cupful who should catch me but that little spy Reep. I tried to explain that I was going on deck for a breath of air（the business about the water had nothing to do with him）and he asked me why I had a cup. He made such a noise that the whole ship was roused. They treated me scandalously. I asked, as I think anyone would have, why Reepicheep was sneaking about the water cask in the middle of the night. He said that as he was too small to be any use on deck, he did sentry over the water every night so that one more man could go to sleep. Now comes their rotten unfairness: they all believed him. Can you beat it?

“I had to apologize or the dangerous little brute would have been at me with his sword. And then Caspian showed up in his true colours as a brutal tyrant and said out loud for everyone to hear that anyone found‘stealing’ water in future would ‘get two dozen’. I didn’t know what this meant till Edmund explained to me. It comes in the sort of books those Pevensie kids read.

“After this cowardly threat Caspian changed his tune and started being patronizing. Said he was sorry for me and that everyone felt just as feverish as I did and we must all make the best of it, etc., etc. Odious stuck-up prig. Stayed in bed all day today.

“September 7. A little wind today but still from the west. Made a few miles eastward with part of the sail, set on what Drinian calls the jury mast—that means the bowsprit set upright and tied（they call it ‘lashed’）to the stump of the real mast. Still terribly thirsty.

“September 8. Still sailing east. I stay in my bunk all day now and see no one except Lucy till the two fiends come to bed. Lucy gives me a little of her water ration. She says girls don’t get as thirsty as boys. I had often thought this but it ought to be more generally known at sea.

“September 9. Land in sight; a very high mountain a long way off to the southeast.

“September 10. The mountain is bigger and clearer but still a long way off. Gulls again today for the first time since I don’t know how long.

“September 11. Caught some fish and had them for dinner. Dropped anchor at about 7 P.M. in three fathoms of water in a bay of this mountainous island. That idiot Caspian wouldn’t let us go ashore because it was getting dark and he was afraid of savages and wild beasts. Extra water ration tonight.”





What awaited them on this island was going to concern Eustace more than anyone else, but it cannot be told in his words because after September 11 he forgot about keeping his diary for a long time.

When morning came, with a low, grey sky but very hot, the adventurers found they were in a bay encircled by such cliffs and crags that it was like a Norwegian fjord. In front of them, at the head of the bay, there was some level land heavily overgrown with trees that appeared to be cedars, through which a rapid stream came out. Beyond that was a steep ascent ending in a jagged ridge and behind that a vague darkness of mountains which ran into dull-coloured clouds so that you could not see their tops. The nearer cliffs, at each side of the bay, were streaked here and there with lines of white which everyone knew to be waterfalls, though at that distance they did not show any movement or make any noise. Indeed the whole place was very silent and the water of the bay as smooth as glass. It reflected every detail of the cliffs. The scene would have been pretty in a picture but was rather oppressive in real life. It was not a country that welcomed visitors.

The whole ship’s company went ashore in two boatloads and everyone drank and washed deliciously in the river and had a meal and a rest before Caspian sent four men back to keep the ship, and the day’s work began. There was everything to be done. The casks must be brought ashore and the faulty ones mended if possible and all refilled; a tree—a pine if they could get it—must be felled and made into a new mast; sails must be repaired; a hunting party organized to shoot any game the land might yield; clothes to be washed and mended; and countless small breakages on board to be set right. For the Dawn Treader herself—and this was more obvious now that they saw her at a distance—could hardly be recognized as the same gallant ship which had left Narrowhaven. She looked a crippled, discoloured hulk which anyone might have taken for a wreck. And her officers and crew were no better—lean, pale, red-eyed from lack of sleep, and dressed in rags.

As Eustace lay under a tree and heard all these plans being discussed his heart sank. Was there going to be no rest? It looked as if their first day on the longed-for land was going to be quite as hard work as a day at sea. Then a delightful idea occurred to him. Nobody was looking—they were all chattering about their ship as if they actually liked the beastly thing. Why shouldn’t he simply slip away? He would take a stroll inland, find a cool, airy place up in the mountains, have a good long sleep, and not rejoin the others till the day’s work was over. He felt it would do him good. But he would take great care to keep the bay and the ship in sight so as to be sure of his way back. He wouldn’t like to be left behind in this country.

He at once put his plan into action. He rose quietly from his place and walked away among the trees, taking care to go slowly and in an aimless manner so that anyone who saw him would think he was merely stretching his legs. He was surprised to find how quickly the noise of conversation died away behind him and how very silent and warm and dark green the wood became. Soon he felt he could venture on a quicker and more determined stride.

This soon brought him out of the wood. The ground began sloping steeply up in front of him. The grass was dry and slippery but manageable if he used his hands as well as his feet, and though he panted and mopped his forehead a good deal, he plugged away steadily. This showed, by the way, that his new life, little as he suspected it, had already done him some good; the old Eustace, Harold and Alberta’s Eustace, would have given up the climb after about ten minutes.

Slowly, and with several rests, he reached the ridge. Here he had expected to have a view into the heart of the island, but the clouds had now come lower and nearer and a sea of fog was rolling to meet him. He sat down and looked back. He was now so high that the bay looked small beneath him and miles of sea were visible. Then the fog from the mountains closed in all round him, thick but not cold, and he lay down and turned this way and that to find the most comfortable position to enjoy himself.

But he didn’t enjoy himself, or not for very long. He began, almost for the first time in his life, to feel lonely. At first this feeling grew very gradually. And then he began to worry about the time. There was not the slightest sound. Suddenly it occurred to him that he might have been lying there for hours. Perhaps the others had gone! Perhaps they had let him wander away on purpose simply in order to leave him behind! He leaped up in a panic and began the descent.

At first he tried to do it too quickly, slipped on the steep grass, and slid for several feet. Then he thought this had carried him too far to the left—and as he came up he had seen precipices on that side. So he clambered up again, as near as he could guess to the place he had started from, and began the descent afresh, bearing to his right. After that things seemed to be going better. He went very cautiously, for he could not see more than a yard ahead, and there was still perfect silence all around him. It is very unpleasant to have to go cautiously when there is a voice inside you saying all the time, “Hurry, hurry, hurry.” For every moment the terrible idea of being left behind grew stronger. If he had understood Caspian and the Pevensies at all he would have known, of course, that there was not the least chance of their doing any such thing. But he had persuaded himself that they were all fiends in human form.

“At last!” said Eustace as he came slithering down a slide of loose stones（scree, they call it）and found himself on the level. “And now, where are those trees? There is something dark ahead. Why, I do believe the fog is clearing.”

It was. The light increased every moment and made him blink. The fog lifted. He was in an utterly unknown valley and the sea was nowhere in sight.





CHAPTER SIX:

THE ADVENTURES OF EUSTACE


AT that very moment the others were washing hands and faces in the river and generally getting ready for dinner and a rest. The three best archers had gone up into the hills north of the bay and returned laden with a pair of wild goats which were now roasting over a fire. Caspian had ordered a cask of wine ashore, strong wine of Archenland which had to be mixed with water before you drank it, so there would be plenty for all. The work had gone well so far and it was a merry meal. Only after the second helping of goat did Edmund say, “Where’s that blighter Eustace?”

Meanwhile Eustace stared round the unknown valley. It was so narrow and deep, and the precipices which surrounded it so sheer, that it was like a huge pit or trench. The floor was grassy though strewn with rocks, and here and there Eustace saw black burnt patches like those you see on the sides of a railway embankment in a dry summer. About fifteen yards away from him was a pool of clear, smooth water. There was, at first, nothing else at all in the valley; not an animal, not a bird, not an insect. The sun beat down and grim peaks and horns of mountains peered over the valley’s edge.

Eustace realized of course that in the fog he had come down the wrong side of the ridge, so he turned at once to see about getting back.But as soon as he had looked he shuddered. Apparently he had by amazing luck found the only possible way down—a long green spit of land, horribly steep and narrow, with precipices on either side. There was no other possible way of getting back. But could he do it, now that he saw what it was really like? His head swam at the very thought of it.

He turned round again, thinking that at any rate he’d better have a good drink from the pool first. But as soon as he had turned and before he had taken a step forward into the valley he heard a noise behind him. It was only a small noise but it sounded loud in that immense silence. It froze him dead-still where he stood for a second. Then he slewed round his neck and looked.

At the bottom of the cliff a little on his left hand was a low, dark hole—the entrance to a cave perhaps. And out of this two thin wisps of smoke were coming. And the loose stones just beneath the dark hollow were moving（that was the noise he had heard）just as if something were crawling in the dark behind them.

Something was crawling. Worse still, something was coming out. Edmund or Lucy or you would have recognized it at once, but Eustace had read none of the right books. The thing that came out of the cave was something he had never even imagined—a long lead-coloured snout, dull red eyes, no feathers or fur, a long lithe body that trailed on the ground, legs whose elbows went up higher than its back like a spider’s cruel claws, bat’s wings that made a rasping noise on the stones, yards of tail. And the lines of smoke were coming from its two nostrils. He never said the word Dragon to himself. Nor would it have made things any better if he had.

But perhaps if he had known something about dragons he would have been a little surprised at this dragon’s behaviour. It did not sit up and clap its wings, nor did it shoot out a stream of flame from its mouth. The smoke from its nostrils was like the smoke of a fire that will not last much longer. Nor did it seem to have noticed Eustace. It moved very slowly towards the pool—slowly and with many pauses. Even in his fear Eustace felt that it was an old, sad creature. He wondered if he dared make a dash for the ascent. But it might look round if he made any noise. It might come more to life. Perhaps it was only shamming. Anyway, what was the use of trying to escape by climbing from a creature that could fly?

It reached the pool and slid its horrible scaly chin down over the gravel to drink: but before it had drunk there came from it a great croaking or clanging cry and after a few twitches and convulsions it rolled round on its side and lay perfectly still with one claw in the air. A little dark blood gushed from its wide-opened mouth. The smoke from its nostrils turned black for a moment and then floated away. No more came.

For a long time Eustace did not dare to move. Perhaps this was the brute’s trick, the way it lured travellers to their doom. But one couldn’t wait forever. He took a step nearer, then two steps, and halted again. The dragon remained motionless; he noticed too that the red fire had gone out of its eyes. At last he came up to it. He was quite sure now that it was dead. With a shudder he touched it; nothing happened.

The relief was so great that Eustace almost laughed out loud. He began to feel as if he had fought and killed the dragon instead of merely seeing it die. He stepped over it and went to the pool for his drink, for the heat was getting unbearable. He was not surprised when he heard a peal of thunder. Almost immediately afterwards the sun disappeared and before he had finished his drink big drops of rain were falling.

The climate of this island was a very unpleasant one. In less than a minute Eustace was wet to the skin and half blinded with such rain as one never sees in Europe. There was no use trying to climb out of the valley as long as this lasted. He bolted for the only shelter in sight—the dragon’s cave. There he lay down and tried to get his breath.

Most of us know what we should expect to find in a dragon’s lair, but, as I said before, Eustace had read only the wrong books. They had a lot to say about exports and imports and governments and drains, but they were weak on dragons. That is why he was so puzzled at the surface on which he was lying. Parts of it were too prickly to be stones and too hard to be thorns, and there seemed to be a great many round, flat things, and it all clinked when he moved. There was light enough at the cave’s mouth to examine it by. And of course Eustace found it to be what any of us could have told him in advance—treasure. There were crowns（those were the prickly things）, coins, rings, bracelets, ingots, cups, plates and gems.

Eustace（unlike most boys）had never thought much of treasure but he saw at once the use it would be in this new world which he had so foolishly stumbled into through the picture in Lucy’s bedroom at home.“They don’t have any tax here,” he said, “And you don’t have to give treasure to the government. With some of this stuff I could have quite a decent time here—perhaps in Calormen. It sounds the least phoney of these countries. I wonder how much I can carry? That bracelet now—those things in it are probably diamonds—I’ll slip that on my own wrist. Too big, but not if I push it right up here above my elbow. Then fill my pockets with diamonds—that’s easier than gold. I wonder when this infernal rain’s going to let up?” He got into a less uncomfortable part of the pile, where it was mostly coins, and settled down to wait. But a bad fright, when once it is over, and especially a bad fright following a mountain walk, leaves you very tired. Eustace fell asleep.

By the time he was sound asleep and snoring the others had finished dinner and become seriously alarmed about him. They shouted, “Eustace! Eustace! Coo-ee!” till they were hoarse and Caspian blew his horn.

“He’s nowhere near or he’d have heard that,” said Lucy with a white face.

“Confound the fellow,” said Edmund. “What on earth did he want to slink away like this for?”

“But we must do something,” said Lucy. “He may have got lost, or fallen into a hole, or been captured by savages.”

“Or killed by wild beasts,” said Drinian.

“And a good riddance if he has, I say,” muttered Rhince.

“Master Rhince,” said Reepicheep, “you never spoke a word that became you less. The creature is no friend of mine but he is of the Queen’s blood, and while he is one of our fellowship it concerns our honour to find him and to avenge him if he is dead.”

“Of course we’ve got to find him（if we can）,” said Caspian wearily.“That’s the nuisance of it. It means a search party and endless trouble. Bother Eustace.”

Meanwhile Eustace slept and slept—and slept. What woke him was a pain in his arm. The moon was shining in at the mouth of the cave, and the bed of treasures seemed to have grown much more comfortable: in fact he could hardly feel it at all. He was puzzled by the pain in his arm at first, but presently it occurred to him that the bracelet which he had shoved up above his elbow had become strangely tight. His arm must have swollen while he was asleep（it was his left arm）.

He moved his right arm in order to feel his left, but stopped before he had moved it an inch and bit his lip in terror. For just in front of him, and a little on his right, where the moonlight fell clear on the floor of the cave, he saw a hideous shape moving. He knew that shape: it was a dragon’s claw. It had moved as he moved his hand and became still when he stopped moving his hand.

“Oh, what a fool I’ve been,” thought Eustace. “Of course, the brute had a mate and it’s lying beside me.”

For several minutes he did not dare to move a muscle. He saw two thin columns of smoke going up before his eyes, black against the moonlight; just as there had been smoke coming from the other dragon’s nose before it died. This was so alarming that he held his breath. The two columns of smoke vanished. When he could hold his breath no longer he let it out stealthily; instantly two jets of smoke appeared again. But even yet he had no idea of the truth.

Presently he decided that he would edge very cautiously to his left and try to creep out of the cave. Perhaps the creature was asleep—and anyway it was his only chance. But of course before he edged to the left he looked to the left. Oh horror! There was a dragon’s claw on that side too.

No one will blame Eustace if at this moment he shed tears. He was surprised at the size of his own tears as he saw them splashing on to the treasure in front of him. They also seemed strangely hot; steam went up from them.

But there was no good crying. He must try to crawl out from between the two dragons. He began extending his right arm. The dragon’s fore-leg and claw on his right went through exactly the same motion. Then he thought he would try his left. The dragon limb on that side moved too.

Two dragons, one on each side, mimicking whatever he did! His nerve broke and he simply made a bolt for it.

There was such a clatter and rasping, and clinking of gold, and grinding of stones, as he rushed out of the cave that he thought they were both following him. He daren’t look back. He rushed to the pool. The twisted shape of the dead dragon lying in the moonlight would have been enough to frighten anyone but now he hardly noticed it. His idea was to get into the water.

But just as he reached the edge of the pool two things happened. First of all, it came over him like a thunder-clap that he had been running on all fours—and why on earth had he been doing that? And secondly, as he bent towards the water, he thought for a second that yet another dragon was staring up at him out of the pool. But in an instant he realized the truth. The dragon face in the pool was his own reflection. There was no doubt of it. It moved as he moved: it opened and shut its mouth as he opened and shut his.

He had turned into a dragon while he was asleep. Sleeping on a dragon’s hoard with greedy, dragonish thoughts in his heart, he had become a dragon himself.

That explained everything. There had been no two dragons beside him in the cave. The claws to right and left had been his own right and left claws. The two columns of smoke had been coming from his own nostrils. As for the pain in his left arm（or what had been his left arm）he could now see what had happened by squinting with his left eye. The bracelet which had fitted very nicely on the upper arm of a boy was far too small for the thick, stumpy foreleg of a dragon. It had sunk deeply into his scaly flesh and there was a throbbing bulge on each side of it. He tore at the place with his dragon’s teeth but could not get it off.

In spite of the pain, his first feeling was one of relief. There was nothing to be afraid of any more. He was a terror himself now and nothing in the world but a knight（and not all of those）would dare to attack him. He could get even with Caspian and Edmund now—

But the moment he thought this he realized that he didn’t want to. He wanted to be friends. He wanted to get back among humans and talk and laugh and share things. He realized that he was a monster cut off from the whole human race. An appalling loneliness came over him. He began to see that the others had not really been fiends at all. He began to wonder if he himself had been such a nice person as he had always supposed. He longed for their voices. He would have been grateful for a kind word even from Reepicheep.

When he thought of this the poor dragon that had been Eustace lifted up its voice and wept. A powerful dragon crying its eyes out under the moon in a deserted valley is a sight and a sound hardly to be imagined.

At last he decided he would try to find his way back to the shore. He realized now that Caspian would never have sailed away and left him. And he felt sure that somehow or other he would be able to make people understand who he was.

He took a long drink and then（I know this sounds shocking, but it isn’t if you think it over）he ate nearly all the dead dragon. He was halfway through it before he realized what he was doing; for, you see, though his mind was the mind of Eustace, his tastes and his digestion were dragonish. And there is nothing a dragon likes so well as fresh dragon. That is why you so seldom find more than one dragon in the same country.

Then he turned to climb out of the valley. He began the climb with a jump and as soon as he jumped he found that he was flying. He had quite forgotten about his wings and it was a great surprise to him—the first pleasant surprise he had had for a long time. He rose high into the air and saw innumerable mountain-tops spread out beneath him in the moonlight. He could see the bay like a silver slab and the Dawn Treader lying at anchor and camp fires twinkling in the woods beside the beach. From a great height he launched himself down towards them in a single glide.

Lucy was sleeping very soundly for she had sat up till the return of the search party in hope of good news about Eustace. It had been led by Caspian and had come back late and weary. Their news was disquieting. They had found no trace of Eustace but had seen a dead dragon in a valley. They tried to make the best of it and everyone assured everyone else that there were not likely to he more dragons about, and that one which was dead at about three o’clock that afternoon（which was when they had seen it）would hardly have been killing people a very few hours before.

“Unless it ate the little brat and died of him: he’d poison anything,” said Rhince. But he said this under his breath and no one heard it.

But later in the night Lucy was wakened, very softly, and found the whole company gathered close together and talking in whispers.

“What is it?” said Lucy.

“We must all show great constancy,” Caspian was saying. “A dragon has just flown over the tree-tops and lighted on the beach. Yes, I am afraid it is between us and the ship. And arrows are no use against dragons. And they’re not at all afraid of fire.”

“With your Majesty’s leave—” began Reepicheep.

“No, Reepicheep,” said the King very firmly, “you are not to attempt a single combat with it. And unless you promise to obey me in this matter I’ll have you tied up. We must just keep close watch and, as soon as it is light, go down to the beach and give it battle. I will lead. King Edmund will be on my right and the Lord Drinian on my left. There are no other arrangements to be made. It will be light in a couple of hours. In an hour’s time let a meal be served out and what is left of the wine. And let everything be done silently.”

“Perhaps it will go away,” said Lucy.

“It’ll be worse if it does,” said Edmund, “because then we shan’t know where it is. If there’s a wasp in the room I like to be able to see it.”

The rest of the night was dreadful, and when the meal came, though they knew they ought to eat, many found that they had very poor appetites. And endless hours seemed to pass before the darkness thinned and birds began chirping here and there and the world got colder and wetter than it had been all night and Caspian said, “Now for it, friends.”

They got up, all with swords drawn, and formed themselves into a solid mass with Lucy in the middle and Reepicheep on her shoulder. It was nicer than the waiting about and everyone felt fonder of everyone else than at ordinary times. A moment later they were marching. It grew lighter as they came to the edge of the wood. And there on the sand, like a giant lizard, or a flexible crocodile, or a serpent with legs, huge and horrible and humpy, lay the dragon.

But when it saw them, instead of rising up and blowing fire and smoke, the dragon retreated—you could almost say it waddled—back into the shallows of the bay.

“What’s it wagging its head like that for?” said Edmund.

“And now it’s nodding,” said Caspian.

“And there’s something coming from its eyes,” said Drinian.

“Oh, can’t you see,” said Lucy. “It’s crying. Those are tears.”

“I shouldn’t trust to that, Ma’am,” said Drinian. “That’s what crocodiles do, to put you off your guard.”

“It wagged its head when you said that,” remarked Edmund. “Just as if it meant No. Look, there it goes again.”

“Do you think it understands what we’re saying?” asked Lucy.

The dragon nodded its head violently.

Reepicheep slipped off Lucy’s shoulder and stepped to the front.

“Dragon,” came his shrill voice, “can you understand speech?”

The dragon nodded.

“Can you speak?”

It shook its head.

“Then,” said Reepicheep, “it is idle to ask you your business. But if you will swear friendship with us raise your left foreleg above your head.”

It did so, but clumsily because that leg was sore and swollen with the golden bracelet.

“Oh look,” said Lucy, “there’s something wrong with its leg. The poor thing—that’s probably what it was crying about. Perhaps it came to us to be cured like in Androcles and the lion.”

“Be careful, Lucy,” said Caspian. “It’s a very clever dragon but it may be a liar.”

Lucy had, however, already run forward, followed by Reepicheep, as fast as his short legs could carry him, and then of course the boys and Drinian came too.

“Show me your poor paw,” said Lucy, “I might be able to cure it.”

The dragon-that-had-been-Eustace held out its sore leg gladly enough, remembering how Lucy’s cordial had cured him of seasickness before he became a dragon. But he was disappointed. The magic fluid reduced the swelling and eased the pain a little but it could not dissolve the gold.

Everyone had now crowded round to watch the treatment, and Caspian suddenly exclaimed, “Look!” He was staring at the bracelet.





CHAPTER SEVEN:

HOW THE ADVENTURE ENDED


“LOOK at what?” said Edmund.

“Look at the device on the gold,” said Caspian.

“A little hammer with a diamond above it like a star,” said Drinian.“Why, I’ve seen that before.”

“Seen it!” said Caspian. “Why, of course you have. It is the sign of a great Narnian house. This is the Lord Octesian’s arm-ring.”

“Villain,” said Reepicheep to the dragon, “have you devoured a Narnian lord?” But the dragon shook his head violently.

“Or perhaps,” said Lucy, “this is the Lord Octesian, turned into a dragon—under an enchantment, you know.”

“It needn’t be either,” said Edmund. “All dragons collect gold. But I think it’s a safe guess that Octesian got no further than this island.”

“Are you the Lord Octesian?” said Lucy to the dragon, and then, when it sadly shook its head, “Are you someone enchanted—someone human, I mean?”

It nodded violently.

And then someone said—people disputed afterwards whether Lucy or Edmund said it first—“You’re not—not Eustace by any chance?”

And Eustace nodded his terrible dragon head and thumped his tail in the sea and everyone skipped back（some of the sailors with ejaculations I will not put down in writing）to avoid the enormous and boiling tears which flowed from his eyes.

Lucy tried hard to console him and even screwed up her courage to kiss the scaly face, and nearly everyone said “Hard luck” and several assured Eustace that they would all stand by him and many said there was sure to be some way of disenchanting him and they’d have him as right as rain in a day or two. And of course they were all very anxious to hear his story, but he couldn’t speak. More than once in the days that followed he attempted to write it for them on the sand. But this never succeeded. In the first place Eustace（never having read the right books）had no idea how to tell a story straight. And for another thing, the muscles and nerves of the dragon-claws that he had to use had never learned to write and were not built for writing anyway. As a result he never got nearly to the end before the tide came in and washed away all the writing except the bits he had already trodden on or accidentally swished out with his tail. And all that anyone had seen would be something like this—the dots are for the bits he had smudged out—

I WNET TO SLEE... RGOS AGRONS I MEAN DRANGONS CAVE CAUSE IT WAS DEAD AND AINING SO HAR... WOKE UP AND COU... GET OFFF MI ARM OH BOTHER …

It was, however, clear to everyone that Eustace’s character had been rather improved by becoming a dragon. He was anxious to help. He flew over the whole island and found that it was all mountainous and inhabited only by wild goats and droves of wild swine. Of these he brought back many carcasses as provisions for the ship. He was a very humane killer too, for he could dispatch a beast with one blow of his tail so that it didn’t know（and presumably still doesn’t know）it had been killed. He ate a few himself, of course, but always alone, for now that he was a dragon he liked his food raw but he could never bear to let others see him at his messy meals. And one day, flying slowly and wearily but in great triumph, he bore back to camp a great tall pine tree which he had torn up by the roots in a distant valley and which could be made into a capital mast. And in the evening if it turned chilly, as it sometimes did after the heavy rains, he was a comfort to everyone, for the whole party would come and sit with their backs against his hot sides and get well warmed and dried; and one puff of his fiery breath would light the most obstinate fire. Sometimes he would take a select party for a fly on his back, so that they could see wheeling below them the green slopes, the rocky heights, the narrow pitlike valleys and far out over the sea to the eastward a spot of darker blue on the blue horizon which might be land.

The pleasure（quite new to him）of being liked and, still more, of liking other people, was what kept Eustace from despair. For it was very dreary being a dragon. He shuddered whenever he caught sight of his own reflection as he flew over a mountain lake. He hated the huge bat-like wings, the saw-edged ridge on his back, and the cruel, curved claws. He was almost afraid to be alone with himself and yet he was ashamed to be with the others. On the evenings when he was not being used as a hot-water bottle he would slink away from the camp and lie curled up like a snake between the wood and the water. On such occasions, greatly to his surprise, Reepicheep was his most constant comforter. The noble Mouse would creep away from the merry circle at the camp fire and sit down by the dragon’s head, well to the windward to be out of the way of his smoky breath. There he would explain that what had happened to Eustace was a striking illustration of the turn of Fortune’s wheel, and that if he had Eustace at his own house in Narnia（it was really a hole not a house and the dragon’s head, let alone his body, would not have fitted in）he could show him more than a hundred examples of emperors, kings, dukes, knights, poets, lovers, astronomers, philosophers, and magicians, who had fallen from prosperity into the most distressing circumstances, and of whom many had recovered and lived happily ever afterwards. It did not, perhaps, seem so very comforting at the time, but it was kindly meant and Eustace never forgot it.

But of course what hung over everyone like a cloud was the problem of what to do with their dragon when they were ready to sail. They tried not to talk of it when he was there, but he couldn’t help overhearing things like, “Would he fit all along one side of the deck? And we’d have to shift all the stores to the other side down below so as to balance,” or, “Would towing him be any good?” or “Would he be able to keep up by flying?” and（most often of all）, “But how are we to feed him?” And poor Eustace realized more and more that since the first day he came on board he had been an unmitigated nuisance and that he was now a greater nuisance still. And this ate into his mind, just as that bracelet ate into his foreleg. He knew that it only made it worse to tear at it with his great teeth, but he couldn’t help tearing now and then, especially on hot nights.





About six days after they had landed on Dragon Island, Edmund happened to wake up very early one morning. It was just getting grey so that you could see the tree-trunks if they were between you and the bay but not in the other direction. As he woke he thought he heard something moving, so he raised himself on one elbow and looked about him: and presently he thought he saw a dark figure moving on the seaward side of the wood. The idea that at once occurred to his mind was, “Are we so sure there are no natives on this island after all?” Then he thought it was Caspian—it was about the right size—but he knew that Caspian had been sleeping next to him and could see that he hadn’t moved. Edmund made sure that his sword was in its place and then rose to investigate.

He came down softly to the edge of the wood and the dark figure was still there. He saw now that it was too small for Caspian and too big for Lucy. It did not run away. Edmund drew his sword and was about to challenge the stranger when the stranger said in a low voice, “Is that you, Edmund?”

“Yes. Who are you?” said he.

“Don’t you know me?” said the other. “It’s me—Eustace.”

“By jove,” said Edmund, “so it is. My dear chap—”

“Hush,” said Eustace and lurched as if he were going to fall.

“Hello!” said Edmund, steadying him. “What’s up? Are you ill?”

Eustace was silent for so long that Edmund thought he was fainting; but at last he said, “It’s been ghastly. You don’t know... but it’s all right now. Could we go and talk somewhere? I don’t want to meet the others just yet.”

“Yes, rather, anywhere you like,” said Edmund. “We can go and sit on the rocks over there. I say, I am glad to see you—er—looking yourself again. You must have had a pretty beastly time.”

They went to the rocks and sat down looking out across the bay while the sky got paler and paler and the stars disappeared except for one very bright one low down and near the horizon.

“I won’t tell you how I became a—a dragon till I can tell the others and get it all over,” said Eustace. “By the way, I didn’t even know it was a dragon till I heard you all using the word when I turned up here the other morning. I want to tell you how I stopped being one.”

“Fire ahead,” said Edmund.

“Well, last night I was more miserable than ever. And that beastly arm-ring was hurting like anything—”

“Is that all right now?”

Eustace laughed—a different laugh from any Edmund had heard him give before—and slipped the bracelet easily off his arm. “There it is,” he said, “and anyone who likes can have it as far as I’m concerned. Well, as I say, I was lying awake and wondering what on earth would become of me. And then—but, mind you, it may have been all a dream. I don’t know.”

“Go on,” said Edmund, with considerable patience.

“Well, anyway, I looked up and saw the very last thing I expected: a huge lion coming slowly towards me. And one queer thing was that there was no moon last night, but there was moonlight where the lion was. So it came nearer and nearer. I was terribly afraid of it. You may think that, being a dragon, I could have knocked any lion out easily enough. But it wasn’t that kind of fear. I wasn’t afraid of it eating me, I was just afraid of it —if you can understand. Well, it came close up to me and looked straight into my eyes. And I shut my eyes tight. But that wasn’t any good because it told me to follow it.”

“You mean it spoke?”

“I don’t know. Now that you mention it, I don’t think it did. But it told me all the same. And I knew I’d have to do what it told me, so I got up and followed it. And it led me a long way into the mountains. And there was always this moonlight over and round the lion wherever we went. So at last we came to the top of a mountain I’d never seen before and on the top of this mountain there was a garden—trees and fruit and everything. In the middle of it there was a well.

“I knew it was a well because you could see the water bubbling up from the bottom of it: but it was a lot bigger than most wells—like a very big, round bath with marble steps going down into it. The water was as clear as anything and I thought if I could get in there and bathe it would ease the pain in my leg. But the lion told me I must undress first. Mind you, I don’t know if he said any words out loud or not.

“I was just going to say that I couldn’t undress because I hadn’t any clothes on when I suddenly thought that dragons are snaky sort of things and snakes can cast their skins. Oh, of course, thought I, that’s what the lion means. So I started scratching myself and my scales began coming off all over the place. And then I scratched a little deeper and, instead of just scales coming off here and there, my whole skin started peeling off beautifully, like it does after an illness, or as if I was a banana. In a minute or two I just stepped out of it. I could see it lying there beside me, looking rather nasty. It was a most lovely feeling. So I started to go down into the well for my bathe.

“But just as I was going to put my feet into the water I looked down and saw that they were all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as they had been before. Oh, that’s all right, said I, it only means I had another smaller suit on underneath the first one, and I’ll have to get out of it too. So 1 scratched and tore again and this underskin peeled off beautifully and out I stepped and left it lying beside the other one and went down to the well for my bathe.

“Well, exactly the same thing happened again. And I thought to myself, oh dear, how ever many skins have I got to take off? For I was longing to bathe my leg. So I scratched away for the third time and got off a third skin, just like the two others, and stepped out of it. But as soon as I looked at myself in the water I knew it had been no good.

“Then the lion said—but I don’t know if it spoke—‘You will have to let me undress you.’ I was afraid of his claws, I can tell you, but I was pretty nearly desperate now. So I just lay flat down on my back to let him do it.

“The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart. And when he began pulling the skin off, it hurt worse than anything I’ve ever felt. The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off. You know—if you’ve ever picked the scab of a sore place. It hurts like billy-oh but it is such fun to see it coming away.”

“I know exactly what you mean,” said Edmund.

“Well, he peeled the beastly stuff right off—just as I thought I’d done it myself the other three times, only they hadn’t hurt—and there it was lying on the grass: only ever so much thicker, and darker, and more knobbly-looking than the others had been. And there was I as smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been. Then he caught hold of me—I didn’t like that much for I was very tender underneath now that I’d no skin on—and threw me into the water. It smarted like anything but only for a moment. After that it became perfectly delicious and as soon as I started swimming and splashing I found that all the pain had gone from my arm. And then I saw why. I’d turned into a boy again. You’d think me simply phoney if I told you how I felt about my own arms. I know they’ve no muscle and are pretty mouldy compared with Caspian’s, but I was so glad to see them.

“After a bit the lion took me out and dressed me—”

“Dressed you. With his paws?”

“Well, I don’t exactly remember that bit. But he did somehow or other: in new clothes—the same I’ve got on now, as a matter of fact. And then suddenly I was back here. Which is what makes me think it must have been a dream.”

“No. It wasn’t a dream,” said Edmund.

“Why not?”

“Well, there are the clothes, for one thing. And you have been—well, un-dragoned, for another.”

“What do you think it was, then?” asked Eustace.

“I think you’ve seen Aslan,” said Edmund.

“Aslan!” said Eustace. “I’ve heard that name mentioned several times since we joined the Dawn Treader. And I felt—I don’t know what—I hated it. But I was hating everything then. And by the way, I’d like to apologize. I’m afraid I’ve been pretty beastly.”

“That’s all right,” said Edmund. “Between ourselves, you haven’t been as bad as I was on my first trip to Narnia. You were only an ass, but I was a traitor.”

“Well, don’t tell me about it, then,” said Eustace. “But who is Aslan? Do you know him?”

“Well—he knows me,” said Edmund. “He is the great Lion, the son of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea, who saved me and saved Narnia. We’ve all seen him. Lucy sees him most often. And it may be Aslan’s country we are sailing to.”

Neither said anything for a while. The last bright star had vanished and though they could not see the sunrise because of the mountains on their right, they knew it was going on because the sky above them and the bay before them turned the colour of roses. Then some bird of the parrot kind screamed in the wood behind them, they heard movements among the trees, and finally a blast on Caspian’s horn. The camp was astir.

Great was the rejoicing when Edmund and the restored Eustace walked into the breakfast circle round the camp fire. And now of course everyone heard the earlier part of his story. People wondered whether the other dragon had killed the Lord Octesian several years ago or whether Octesian himself had been the old dragon. The jewels with which Eustace had crammed his pockets in the cave had disappeared along with the clothes he had then been wearing: but no one, least of all Eustace himself, felt any desire to go back to that valley for more treasure.

In a few days now the Dawn Treader, remasted, repainted, and well stored, was ready to sail. Before they embarked Caspian caused to be cut on a smooth cliff facing the bay the words:

DRAGON ISLAND

DISCOVERED BY CASPIAN X, KING OF NARNIA, ETC.

IN THE FOURTH

YEAR OF HIS REIGN.

HERE, AS WE SUPPOSE, THE LORD OCTESIAN

HAD HIS DEATH

It would be nice, and fairly nearly true, to say that “from that time forth Eustace was a different boy”. To be strictly accurate, he began to be a different boy. He had relapses. There were still many days when he could be very tiresome. But most of those I shall not notice. The cure had begun.

The Lord Octesian’s arm ring had a curious fate. Eustace did not want it and offered it to Caspian and Caspian offered it to Lucy. She did not care about having it. “Very well, then, catch as catch can,” said Caspian and flung it up in the air. This was when they were all standing looking at the inscription. Up went the ring, flashing in the sunlight, and caught, and hung, as neatly as a well-thrown quoit, on a little projection on the rock. No one could climb up to get it from below and no one could climb down to get it from above. And there, for all I know, it is hanging still and may hang till that world ends.





CHAPTER EIGHT:

TWO NARROW ESCAPES


EVERYONE was cheerful as the Dawn Treader sailed from Dragon Island. They had fair winds as soon as they were out of the bay and came early next morning to the unknown land which some of them had seen when flying over the mountains while Eustace was still a dragon. It was a low green island inhabited by nothing but rabbits and a few goats, but from the ruins of stone huts, and from blackened places where fires had been, they judged that it had been peopled not long before. There were also some bones and broken weapons.

“Pirates’ work,” said Caspian.

“Or the dragon’s,” said Edmund.

The only other thing they found there was a little skin boat, or coracle, on the sands. It was made of hide stretched over a wicker framework. It was a tiny boat, barely four feet long, and the paddle which still lay in it was in proportion. They thought that either it had been made for a child or else that the people of that country had been Dwarfs. Reepicheep decided to keep it, as it was just the right size for him; so it was taken on board. They called that land Burnt Island, and sailed away before noon.

For some five days they ran before a south-southeast wind, out of sight of all lands and seeing neither fish nor gull. Then they had a day that rained hard till the afternoon. Eustace lost two games of chess to Reepicheep and began to get like his old and disagreeable self again, and Edmund said he wished they could have gone to America with Susan. Then Lucy looked out of the stern windows and said:

“Hello! I do believe it’s stopping. And what’s that?”

They all tumbled up to the poop at this and found that the rain had stopped and that Drinian, who was on watch, was also staring hard at something astern. Or rather, at several things. They looked a little like smooth rounded rocks, a whole line of them with intervals of about forty feet in between.

“But they can’t be rocks,” Drinian was saying, “because they weren’t there five minutes ago.”

“And one’s just disappeared,” said Lucy.

“Yes, and there’s another one coming up,” said Edmund.

“And nearer,” said Eustace.

“Hang it!” said Caspian. “The whole thing is moving this way.”

“And moving a great deal quicker than we can sail, Sire,” said Drinian. “It’ll be up with us in a minute.”

They all held their breath, for it is not at all nice to be pursued by an unknown something either on land or sea. But what it turned out to be was far worse than anyone had suspected. Suddenly, only about the length of a cricket pitch from their port side, an appalling head reared itself out of the sea. It was all greens and vermilions with purple blotches—except where shellfish clung to it—and shaped rather like a horse’s, though without ears. It had enormous eyes, eyes made for staring through the dark depths of the ocean, and a gaping mouth filled with double rows of sharp fish-like teeth. It came up on what they first took to be a huge neck, but as more and more of it emerged everyone knew that this was not its neck but its body and that at last they were seeing what so many people have foolishly wanted to see—the great Sea Serpent. The folds of its gigantic tail could be seen far away, rising at intervals from the surface. And now its head was towering up higher than the mast.

Every man rushed to his weapon, but there was nothing to be done, the monster was out of reach. “Shoot! Shoot!” cried the Master Bowman, and several obeyed, but the arrows glanced off the Sea Serpent’s hide as if it was iron-plated. Then, for a dreadful minute, everyone was still, staring up at its eyes and mouth and wondering where it would pounce.

But it didn’t pounce. It shot its head forward across the ship on a level with the yard of the mast. Now its head was just beside the fighting top. Still it stretched and stretched till its head was over the starboard bulwark. Then down it began to come—not onto the crowded deck but into the water, so that the whole ship was under an arch of serpent. And almost at once that arch began to get smaller: indeed on the starboard the Sea Serpent was now almost touching the Dawn Treader’s side.

Eustace（who had really been trying very hard to behave well, till the rain and the chess put him back）now did the first brave thing he had ever done. He was wearing a sword that Caspian had lent him. As soon as the serpent’s body was near enough on the starboard side he jumped on to the bulwark and began hacking at it with all his might. It is true that he accomplished nothing beyond breaking Caspian’s second-best sword into bits, but it was a fine thing for a beginner to have done.

Others would have joined him if at that moment Reepicheep had not called out, “Don’t fight! Push!” It was so unusual for the Mouse to advise anyone not to fight that, even in that terrible moment, every eye turned to him. And when he jumped up on to the bulwark, forward of the snake,and set his little furry back against its huge scaly, slimy back, and began pushing as hard as he could, quite a number of people saw what he meant and rushed to both sides of the ship to do the same. And when, a moment later, the Sea Serpent’s head appeared again, this time on the port side, and this time with its back to them, then everyone understood.

The brute had made a loop of itself round the Dawn Treader and was beginning to draw the loop tight. When it got quite tight—snap!—there would be floating matchwood where the ship had been and it could pick them out of the water one by one. Their only chance was to push the loop backward till it slid over the stern; or else（to put the same thing another way）to push the ship forward out of the loop.

Reepicheep alone had, of course, no more chance of doing this than of lifting up a cathedral, but he had nearly killed himself with trying before others shoved him aside. Very soon the whole ship’s company except Lucy and the Mouse（which was fainting）was in two long lines along the two bulwarks, each man’s chest to the back of the man in front, so that the weight of the whole line was in the last man, pushing for their lives. For a few sickening seconds（which seemed like hours）nothing appeared to happen. Joints cracked, sweat dropped, breath came in grunts and gasps. Then they felt that the ship was moving. They saw that the snake-loop was further from the mast than it had been. But they also saw that it was smaller. And now the real danger was at hand. Could they get it over the poop, or was it already too tight? Yes. It would just fit. It was resting on the poop rails. A dozen or more sprang up on the poop. This was far better. The Sea Serpent’s body was so low now that they could make a line across the poop and push side by side. Hope rose high till everyone remembered the high carved stern, the dragon tail, of the Dawn Treader. It would be quite impossible to get the brute over that.

“An axe,” cried Caspian hoarsely, “and still shove.” Lucy, who knew where everything was, heard him where she was standing on the main deck staring up at the poop. In a few seconds she had been below, got the axe, and was rushing up the ladder to the poop. But just as she reached the top there came a great crashing noise like a tree coming down and the ship rocked and darted forward. For at that very moment, whether because the Sea Serpent was being pushed so hard, or because it foolishly decided to draw the noose tight, the whole of the carved stern broke off and the ship was free.

The others were too exhausted to see what Lucy saw. There, a few yards behind them, the loop of Sea Serpent’s body got rapidly smaller and disappeared into a splash. Lucy always said（but of course she was very excited at the moment, and it may have been only imagination）that she saw a look of idiotic satisfaction on the creature’s face. What is certain is that it was a very stupid animal, for instead of pursuing the ship it turned its head round and began nosing all along its own body as if it expected to find the wreckage of the Dawn Treader there. But the Dawn Treader was already well away, running before a fresh breeze, and the men lay and sat panting and groaning all about the deck, till presently they were able to talk about it, and then to laugh about it. And when some rum had been served out they even raised a cheer; and everyone praised the valour of Eustace（though it hadn’t done any good）and of Reepicheep.

After this they sailed for three days more and saw nothing but sea and sky. On the fourth day the wind changed to the north and the seas began to rise; by the afternoon it had nearly become a gale. But at the same time they sighted land on their port bow.

“By your leave, Sire,” said Drinian, “we will try to get under the lee of that country by rowing and lie in harbour, maybe till this is over.”Caspian agreed, but a long row against the gale did not bring them to the land before evening. By the last light of that day they steered into a natural harbour and anchored, but no one went ashore that night. In the morning they found themselves in the green bay of a rugged, lonely-looking country which sloped up to a rocky summit. From the windy north beyond that summit clouds came streaming rapidly. They lowered the boat and loaded her with any of the water casks which were now empty.

“Which stream shall we water at, Drinian?” said Caspian as he took his seat in the stern-sheets of the boat. “There seem to be two coming down into the bay.”

“It makes little odds, Sire,” said Drinian. “But I think it’s a shorter pull to that on the starboard—the eastern one.”

“Here comes the rain,” said Lucy.

“I should think it does!” said Edmund, for it was already pelting hard. “I say, let’s go to the other stream. There are trees there and we’ll have some shelter.”

“Yes, let’s,” said Eustace. “No point in getting wetter than we need.”

But all the time Drinian was steadily steering to the starboard, like tiresome people in cars who continue at forty miles an hour while you are explaining to them that they are on the wrong road.

“They’re right, Drinian,” said Caspian. “Why don’t you bring her head round and make for the western stream?”

“As your Majesty pleases,” said Drinian a little shortly. He had had an anxious day with the weather yesterday, and he didn’t like advice from landsmen. But he altered course; and it turned out afterwards that it was a good thing he did.

By the time they had finished watering, the rain was over and Caspian, with Eustace, the Pevensies, and Reepicheep, decided to walk up to the top of the hill and see what could be seen. It was a stiffish climb through coarse grass and heather and they saw neither man nor beast, except seagulls. When they reached the top they saw that it was a very small island, not more than twenty acres; and from this height the sea looked larger and more desolate than it did from the deck, or even the fighting-top, of the Dawn Treader.

“Crazy, you know,” said Eustace to Lucy in a low voice, looking at the eastern horizon. “Sailing on and on into that with no idea what we may get to.” But he only said it out of habit, not really nastily as he would have done at one time.

It was too cold to stay long on the ridge for the wind still blew freshly from the north.

“Don’t let’s go back the same way,” said Lucy as they turned;“let’s go along a bit and come down by the other stream, the one Drinian wanted to go to.”

Everyone agreed to this and after about fifteen minutes they were at the source of the second river. It was a more interesting place than they had expected; a deep little mountain lake, surrounded by cliffs except for a narrow channel on the seaward side out of which the water flowed. Here at last they were out of the wind, and all sat down in the heather above the cliff for a rest.

All sat down, but one（it was Edmund）jumped up again very quickly.

“They go in for sharp stones on this island,” he said, groping about in the heather. “Where is the wretched thing?... Ah, now I’ve got it... Hullo! It wasn’t a stone at all, it’s a sword-hilt. No, by jove, it’s a whole sword; what the rust has left of it. It must have lain here for ages.”

“Narnian, too, by the look of it,” said Caspian, as they all crowded round.

“I’m sitting on something too,” said Lucy. “Something hard.” It turned out to be the remains of a mail shirt. By this time everyone was on hands and knees, feeling in the thick heather in every direction. Their search revealed, one by one, a helmet, a dagger, and a few coins; not Calormen crescents but genuine Narnian “Lions” and “Trees” such as you might see any day in the market-place of Beaversdam or Beruna.

“Looks as if this might be all that’s left of one of our seven lords,” said Edmund.

“Just what I was thinking,” said Caspian. “I wonder which it was. There’s nothing on the dagger to show. And I wonder how he died.”

“And how we are to avenge him,” added Reepicheep.

Edmund, the only one of the party who had read several detective stories, had meanwhile been thinking.

“Look here,” he said, “there’s something very fishy about this. He can’t have been killed in a fight.”

“Why not?” asked Caspian.

“No bones,” said Edmund. “An enemy might take the armour and leave the body. But who ever heard of a chap who’d won a fight carrying away the body and leaving the armour?”

“Perhaps he was killed by a wild animal,” Lucy suggested.

“It’d be a clever animal,” said Edmund, “that would take a man’s mail shirt off.”

“Perhaps a dragon?” said Caspian.

“Nothing doing,” said Eustace. “A dragon couldn’t do it. I ought to know.”

“Well, let’s get away from the place, anyway,” said Lucy. She had not felt like sitting down again since Edmund had raised the question of bones.

“If you like,” said Caspian, getting up. “I don’t think any of this stuff is worth taking away.”

They came down and round to the little opening where the stream came out of the lake, and stood looking at the deep water within the circle of cliffs. If it had been a hot day, no doubt some would have been tempted to bathe and everyone would have had a drink. Indeed, even as it was, Eustace was on the very point of stooping down and scooping up some water in his hands when Reepicheep and Lucy both at the same moment cried, “Look,” so he forgot about his drink and looked into the water.

The bottom of the pool was made of large greyish-blue stones and the water was perfectly clear, and on the bottom lay a life-size figure of a man, made apparently of gold. It lay face downwards with its arms stretched out above its head. And it so happened that as they looked at it, the clouds parted and the sun shone out. The golden shape was lit up from end to end. Lucy thought it was the most beautiful statue she had ever seen.

“Well!” whistled Caspian. “That was worth coming to see! I wonder, can we get it out?”

“We can dive for it, Sire,” said Reepicheep.

“No good at all,” said Edmund. “At least, if it’s really gold—solid gold—it’ll be far too heavy to bring up. And that pool’s twelve or fifteen feet deep if it’s an inch. Half a moment, though. It’s a good thing I’ve brought a hunting spear with me. Let’s see what the depth is like. Hold on to my hand, Caspian, while I lean out over the water a bit.” Caspian took his hand and Edmund, leaning forward, began to lower his spear into the water.

Before it was half-way in Lucy said, “I don’t believe the statue is gold at all. It’s only the light. Your spear looks just the same colour.”

“What’s wrong?” asked several voices at once; for Edmund had suddenly let go of the spear.

“I couldn’t hold it,” gasped Edmund, “it seemed so heavy.”

“And there it is on the bottom now,” said Caspian, “and Lucy is right. It looks just the same colour as the statue.”

But Edmund, who appeared to be having some trouble with his boots—at least he was bending down and looking at them—straightened himself all at once and shouted out in the sharp voice which people hardly ever disobey:

“Get back! Back from the water. All of you. At once!!”

They all did and stared at him.

“Look,” said Edmund, “look at the toes of my boots.”“They look a bit yellow,” began Eustace.

“They’re gold, solid gold,” interrupted Edmund. “Look at them. Feel them. The leather’s pulled away from it already. And they’re as heavy as lead.”

“By Aslan!” said Caspian. “You don’t mean to say—?”

“Yes, I do,” said Edmund. “That water turns things into gold. It turned the spear into gold, that’s why it got so heavy. And it was just lapping against my feet（it’s a good thing I wasn’t barefoot）and it turned the toe-caps into gold. And that poor fellow on the bottom—well, you see.”

“So it isn’t a statue at all,” said Lucy in a low voice.

“No. The whole thing is plain now. He was here on a hot day. He undressed on top of the cliff—where we were sitting. The clothes have rotted away or been taken by birds to line nests with; the armour’s still there. Then he dived and—”

“Don’t,” said Lucy. “What a horrible thing.”

“And what a narrow shave we’ve had,” said Edmund.

“Narrow indeed,” said Reepicheep. “Anyone’s finger, anyone’s foot, anyone’s whisker, or anyone’s tail, might have slipped into the water at any moment.”

“All the same,” said Caspian, “we may as well test it.” He stooped down and wrenched up a spray of heather. Then, very cautiously, he knelt beside the pool and dipped it in. It was heather that he dipped; what he drew out was a perfect model of heather made of the purest gold, heavy and soft as lead.

“The King who owned this island,” said Caspian slowly, and his face flushed as he spoke, “would soon be the richest of all Kings of the world. I claim this land forever as a Narnian possession. It shall be called Goldwater Island. And I bind all of you to secrecy. No one must know of this. Not even Drinian—on pain of death, do you hear?”

“Who are you talking to?” said Edmund. “I’m no subject of yours. If anything it’s the other way round. I am one of the four ancient sovereigns of Narnia and you are under allegiance to the High King my brother.”

“So it has come to that, King Edmund, has it?” said Caspian, laying his hand on his sword-hilt.

“Oh, stop it, both of you,” said Lucy. “That’s the worst of doing anything with boys. You’re all such swaggering, bullying idiots—oooh!—” Her voice died away into a gasp. And everyone else saw what she had seen.

Across the grey hillside above them—grey, for the heather was not yet in bloom—without noise, and without looking at them, and shining as if he were in bright sunlight though the sun had in fact gone in, passed with slow pace the hugest lion that human eyes have ever seen. In describing the scene Lucy said afterwards, “He was the size of an elephant,” though at another time she only said, “The size of a cart-horse.”But it was not the size that mattered. Nobody dared to ask what it was. They knew it was Aslan.

And nobody ever saw how or where he went. They looked at one another like people waking from sleep.

“What were we talking about?” said Caspian. “Have I been making rather an ass of myself?”

“Sire,” said Reepicheep, “this is a place with a curse on it. Let us get back on board at once. And if I might have the honour of naming this island, I should call it Deathwater.”

“That strikes me as a very good name, Reep,” said Caspian, “though now that I come to think of it, I don’t know why. But the weather seems to be settling and I dare say Drinian would like to be off. What a lot we shall have to tell him.”

But in fact they had not much to tell for the memory of the last hour had all become confused.

“Their Majesties all seemed a bit bewitched when they came aboard,” said Drinian to Rhince some hours later when the Dawn Treader was once more under sail and Deathwater Island already below the horizon. “Something happened to them in that place. The only thing I could get clear was that they think they’ve found the body of one of these lords we’re looking for.”

“You don’t say so, Captain,” answered Rhince. “Well, that’s three. Only four more. At this rate we might be home soon after the New Year. And a good thing too. My baccy’s running a bit low. Good night, Sir.”





CHAPTER NINE:

THE ISLAND OF THE VOICES


AND now the winds which had so long been from the northwest began to blow from the west itself and every morning when the sun rose out of the sea the curved prow of the Dawn Treader stood up right across the middle of the sun. Some thought that the sun looked larger than it looked from Narnia, but others disagreed. And they sailed and sailed before a gentle yet steady breeze and saw neither fish nor gull nor ship nor shore. And stores began to get low again, and it crept into their hearts that perhaps they might have come to a sea which went on forever. But when the very last day on which they thought they could risk continuing their eastward voyage dawned, it revealed, right ahead between them and the sunrise, a low land lying like a cloud.

They made harbour in a wide bay about the middle of the afternoon and landed. It was a very different country from any they had yet seen. For when they had crossed the sandy beach they found all silent and empty as if it were an uninhabited land, but before them there were level lawns in which the grass was as smooth and short as it used to be in the grounds of a great English house where ten gardeners were kept. The trees, of which there were many, all stood well apart from one another, and there were no broken branches and no leaves lying on the ground. Pigeons sometimes cooed but there was no other noise.

Presently they came to a long, straight, sanded path with not a weed growing on it and trees on either hand. Far off at the other end of this avenue they now caught sight of a house—very long and grey and quiet looking in the afternoon sun.

Almost as soon as they entered this path Lucy noticed that she had a little stone in her shoe. In that unknown place it might have been wiser for her to ask the others to wait while she took it out. But she didn’t; she just dropped quietly behind and sat down to take off her shoe. Her lace had got into a knot.

Before she had undone the knot the others were a fair distance ahead. By the time she had got the stone out and was putting the shoe on again she could no longer hear them. But almost at once she heard something else. It was not coming from the direction of the house.

What she heard was a thumping. It sounded as if dozens of strong workmen were hitting the ground as hard as they could with great wooden mallets. And it was very quickly coming nearer. She was already sitting with her back to a tree, and as the tree was not one she could climb, there was really nothing to do but to sit dead still and press herself against the tree and hope she wouldn’t be seen.

Thump, thump, thump... and whatever it was must be very close now for she could feel the ground shaking. But she could see nothing. She thought the thing—or things—must be just behind her. But then there came a thump on the path right in front of her. She knew it was on the path not only by the sound but because she saw the sand scatter as if it had been struck a heavy blow. But she could see nothing that had struck it. Then all the thumping noises drew together about twenty feet away from her and suddenly ceased. Then came the Voice.

It was really very dreadful because she could still see nobody at all. The whole of that park-like country still looked as quiet and empty as it had looked when they first landed. Nevertheless, only a few feet away from her, a voice spoke. And what it said was:

“Mates, now’s our chance.”

Instantly a whole chorus of other voices replied, “Hear him. Hear him. ‘Now’s our chance’, he said. Well done, Chief. You never said a truer word.”

“What I say,” continued the first voice, “is, get down to the shore between them and their boat, and let every mother’s son look to his weapons. Catch ’em when they try to put to sea.”

“Eh, that’s the way,” shouted all the other voices. “You never made a better plan, Chief. Keep it up, Chief. You couldn’t have a better plan than that.”

“Lively, then, mates, lively,” said the first voice. “Off we go.”

“Right again, Chief,” said the others. “Couldn’t have a better order. Just what we were going to say ourselves. Off we go.”

Immediately the thumping began again—very loud at first but soon fainter and fainter, till it died out in the direction of the sea.

Lucy knew there was no time to sit puzzling as to what these invisible creatures might be. As soon as the thumping noise had died away she got up and ran along the path after the others as quickly as her legs would carry her. They must at all costs be warned.

While this had been happening the others had reached the house. It was a low building—only two stories high—made of a beautiful mellow stone, many-windowed, and partially covered with ivy. Everything was so still that Eustace said, “I think it’s empty,” but Caspian silently pointed to the column of smoke which rose from one chimney.

They found a wide gateway open and passed through it into a paved courtyard. And it was here that they had their first indication that there was something odd about this island. In the middle of the courtyard stood a pump, and beneath the pump a bucket. There was nothing odd about that. But the pump handle was moving up and down, though there seemed to be no one moving it.

“There’s some magic at work here,” said Caspian.

“Machinery!” said Eustace. “I do believe we’ve come to a civilized country at last.”

At that moment Lucy, hot and breathless, rushed into the courtyard behind them. In a low voice she tried to make them understand what she had overheard. And when they had partly understood it even the bravest of them did not look very happy.

“Invisible enemies,” muttered Caspian. “And cutting us off from the boat. This is an ugly furrow to plough.”

“You’ve no idea what sort of creatures they are, Lu?” asked Edmund.

“How can I, Ed, when I couldn’t see them?”

“Did they sound like humans from their footsteps?”

“I didn’t hear any noise of feet—only voices and this frightful thudding and thumping—like a mallet.”

“I wonder,” said Reepicheep, “do they become visible when you drive a sword into them?”

“It looks as if we shall find out,” said Caspian. “But let’s get out of this gateway. There’s one of these gentry at that pump listening to all we say.”

They came out and went back on to the path where the trees might possibly make them less conspicuous. “Not that it’s any good really,” said Eustace, “trying to hide from people you can’t see. They may be all round us.”

“Now, Drinian,” said Caspian. “How would it be if we gave up the boat for lost, went down to another part of the bay, and signalled to the Dawn Treader to stand in and take us aboard?”

“Not depth for her, Sire,” said Drinian.

“We could swim,” said Lucy.

“Your Majesties all,” said Reepicheep, “hear me. It is folly to think of avoiding an invisible enemy by any amount of creeping and skulking. If these creatures mean to bring us to battle, be sure they will succeed. And whatever comes of it I’d sooner meet them face to face than be caught by the tail.”

“I really think Reep is in the right this time,” said Edmund.

“Surely,” said Lucy, “if Rhince and the others on the Dawn Treader see us fighting on the shore they’ll be able to do something.”

“But they won’t see us fighting if they can’t see any enemy,” said Eustace miserably. “They’ll think we’re just swinging our swords in the air for fun.”

There was an uncomfortable pause.

“Well,” said Caspian at last, “let’s get on with it. We must go and face them. Shake hands all round—arrow on the string, Lucy—swords out, everyone else—and now for it. Perhaps they’ll parley.”

It was strange to see the lawns and the great trees looking so peaceful as they marched back to the beach. And when they arrived there, and saw the boat lying where they had left her, and the smooth sand with no one to be seen on it, more than one doubted whether Lucy had not merely imagined all she had told them. But before they reached the sand, a voice spoke out of the air.

“No further, masters, no further now,” it said. “We’ve got to talk with you first. There’s fifty of us and more here with weapons in our fists.”

“Hear him, hear him,” came the chorus. “That’s our Chief. You can depend on what he says. He’s telling you the truth, he is.”

“I do not see these fifty warriors,” observed Reepicheep.

“That’s right, that’s right,” said the Chief Voice. “You don’t see us. And why not? Because we’re invisible.”

“Keep it up, Chief, keep it up,” said the Other Voices. “You’re talking like a book. They couldn’t ask for a better answer than that.”

“Be quiet, Reep,” said Caspian, and then added in a louder voice,“You invisible people, what do you want with us? And what have we done to earn your enmity?”

“We want something that little girl can do for us,” said the Chief Voice.（The others explained that this was just what they would have said themselves.）

“Little girl!” said Reepicheep. “The lady is a queen.”“We don’t know about queens,” said the Chief Voice.（“No more we do, no more we do,” chimed in the others.）“But we want something she can do.”

“What is it?” said Lucy.

“And if it is anything against her Majesty’s honour or safety,” added Reepicheep, “you will wonder to see how many we can kill before we die.”

“Well,” said the Chief Voice. “It’s a long story. Suppose we all sit down?”

The proposal was warmly approved by the other voices but the Narnians remained standing.

“Well,” said the Chief Voice. “It’s like this. This island has been the property of a great magician time out of mind. And we all are—or perhaps in a manner of speaking, I might say, we were—his servants. Well, to cut a long story short, this magician that I was speaking about, he told us to do something we didn’t like. And why not? Because we didn’t want to. Well, then, this same magician he fell into a great rage; for I ought to tell you he owned the island and he wasn’t used to being crossed. He was terribly downright, you know. But let me see, where am I? Oh yes, this magician then, he goes upstairs（for you must know he kept all his magic things up there and we all lived down below）, I say he goes upstairs and puts a spell on us. An uglifying spell. If you saw us now, which in my opinion you may thank your stars you can’t, you wouldn’t believe what we looked like before we were uglified. You wouldn’t really. So there we all were so ugly we couldn’t bear to look at one another. So then what did we do? Well, I’ll tell you what we did. We waited till we thought this same magician would be asleep in the afternoon and we creep upstairs and go to his magic book, as bold as brass, to see if we can do anything about this uglification. But we were all of a sweat and a tremble, so I won’t deceive you. But, believe me or believe me not, I do assure you that we couldn’t find anything in the way of a spell for taking off the ugliness. And what with time getting on and being afraid that the old gentleman might wake up any minute—I was all of a muck sweat, so I won’t deceive you—well, to cut a long story short, whether we did right or whether we did wrong, in the end we see a spell for making people invisible. And we thought we’d rather be invisible than go on being as ugly as all that. And why? Because we’d like it better. So my little girl, who’s just about your little girl’s age, and a sweet child she was before she was uglified, though now—but least said soonest mended—I say, my little girl she says the spell, for it’s got to be a little girl or else the magician himself, if you see my meaning, for otherwise it won’t work. And why not? Because nothing happens. So my Clipsie says the spell, for I ought to have told you she reads beautifully, and there we all were as invisible as you could wish to see. And I do assure you it was a relief not to see one another’s faces. At first, anyway. But the long and the short of it is we’re mortal tired of being invisible. And there’s another thing. We never reckoned on this magician（the one I was telling you about before）going invisible too. But we haven’t ever seen him since. So we don’t know if he’s dead, or gone .away, or whether he’s just sitting upstairs being invisible, and perhaps coming down and being invisible there. And, believe me, it’s no manner of use listening because he always did go about with his bare feet on, making no more noise than a great big cat. And I’ll tell all you gentlemen straight, it’s getting more than what our nerves can stand.”

Such was the Chief Voice’s story, but very much shortened, because I have left out what the Other Voices said. Actually he never got out more than six or seven words without being interrupted by their agreements and encouragements, which drove the Narnians nearly out of their minds with impatience. When it was over there was a very long silence.

“But,” said Lucy at last, “what’s all this got to do with us? I don’t understand.”

“Why, bless me, if I haven’t gone and left out the whole point,” said the Chief Voice.

“That you have, that you have,” roared the Other Voices with great enthusiasm. “No one couldn’t have left it out cleaner and better. Keep it up, Chief, keep it up.”

“Well, I needn’t go over the whole story again,” began the Chief Voice.

“No. Certainly not,” said Caspian and Edmund.

“Well, then, to put it in a nutshell,” said the Chief Voice, “we’ve been waiting for ever so long for a nice little girl from foreign parts, like it might be you, Missie—that would go upstairs and go to the magic book and find the spell that takes off the invisibleness, and say it. And we all swore that the first strangers as landed on this island（having a nice little girl with them, I mean, for if they hadn’t it’d be another matter）we wouldn’t let them go away alive unless they’d done the needful for us. And that’s why, gentlemen, if your little girl doesn’t come up to scratch, it will be our painful duty to cut all your throats. Merely in the way of business, as you might say, and no offence, I hope.”

“I don’t see all your weapons,” said Reepicheep. “Are they invisible too?” The words were scarcely out of his mouth before they heard a whizzing sound and next moment a spear had stuck, quivering, in one of the trees behind them.

“That’s a spear, that is,” said the Chief Voice.

“That it is, Chief, that it is,” said the others. “You couldn’t have put it better.”

“And it came from my hand,” the Chief Voice continued. “They get visible when they leave us.”

“But why do you want me to do this?” asked Lucy.

“Why can’t one of your own people? Haven’t you got any girls?”

“We dursen’t, we dursen’t,” said all the Voices. “We’re not going upstairs again.”

“In other words,” said Caspian, “you are asking this lady to face some danger which you daren’t ask your own sisters and daughters to face!”

“That’s right, that’s right,” said all the Voices cheerfully. “You couldn’t have said it better. Eh, you’ve had some education, you have. Anyone can see that.”

“Well, of all the outrageous—“ began Edmund, but Lucy interrupted.“Would I have to go upstairs at night, or would it do in daylight?”

“Oh, daylight, daylight, to be sure,” said the Chief Voice. “Not at night. No one’s asking you to do that. Go upstairs in the dark? Ugh.”

“All right, then, I’ll do it,” said Lucy. “No,” she said, turning to the others, “don’t try to stop me. Can’t you see it’s no use? There are dozens of them there. We can’t fight them. And the other way there is a chance.”

“But a magician!” said Caspian.

“I know,” said Lucy. “But he mayn’t be as bad as they make out. Don’t you get the idea that these people are not very brave?”

“They’re certainly not very clever,” said Eustace.

“Look here, Lu,” said Edmund. “We really can’t let you do a thing like this. Ask Reep, I’m sure he’ll say just the same.”

“But it’s to save my own life as well as yours,” said Lucy. “I don’t want to be cut to bits with invisible swords any more than anyone else.”

“Her Majesty is in the right,” said Reepicheep. “If we had any assurance of saving her by battle, our duty would be very plain. It appears to me that we have none. And the service they ask of her is in no way contrary to her Majesty’s honour, but a noble and heroical act. If the Queen’s heart moves her to risk the magician, I will not speak against it.”

As no one had ever known Reepicheep to be afraid of anything, he could say this without feeling at all awkward. But the boys, who had all been afraid quite often, grew very red. None the less, it was such obvious sense that they had to give in. Loud cheers broke from the invisible people when their decision was announced, and the Chief Voice（warmly supported by all the others）invited the Narnians to come to supper and spend the night. Eustace didn’t want to accept, but Lucy said, “I’m sure they’re not treacherous. They’re not like that at all,” and the others agreed. And so, accompanied by an enormous noise of thumpings（which became louder when they reached the flagged and echoing courtyard）they all went back to the house.





CHAPTER TEN:

THE MAGICIAN’S BOOK


THE invisible people feasted their guests royally. It was very funny to see the plates and dishes coming to the table and not to see anyone carrying them. It would have been funny even if they had moved along level with the floor, as you would expect things to do in invisible hands. But they didn’t. They progressed up the long dining-hall in a series of bounds or jumps. At the highest point of each jump a dish would be about fifteen feet up in the air; then it would come down and stop quite suddenly about three feet from the floor. When the dish contained anything like soup or stew the result was rather disastrous.

“I’m beginning to feel very inquisitive about these people,” whispered Eustace to Edmund. “Do you think they’re human at all? More like huge grasshoppers or giant frogs, I should say.”

“It does look like it,” said Edmund. “But don’t put the idea of the grasshoppers into Lucy’s head. She’s not too keen on insects; especially big ones.”

The meal would have been pleasanter if it had not been so exceedingly messy, and also if the conversation had not consisted entirely of agreements. The invisible people agreed about everything. Indeed most of their remarks were the sort it would not be easy to disagree with:“What I always say is, when a chap’s hungry, he likes some victuals,” or“Getting dark now; always does at night,” or even “Ah, you’ve come over the water. Powerful wet stuff, ain’t it?” And Lucy could not help looking at the dark yawning entrance to the foot of the staircase—she could see it from where she sat—and wondering what she would find when she went up those stairs next morning. But it was a good meal otherwise, with mushroom soup and boiled chickens and hot boiled ham and gooseberries, redcurrants, curds, cream, milk, and mead. The others liked the mead but Eustace was sorry afterwards that he had drunk any.

When Lucy woke up next morning it was like waking up on the day of an examination or a day when you are going to the dentist. It was a lovely morning with bees buzzing in and out of her open window and the lawn outside looking very like somewhere in England. She got up and dressed and tried to talk and eat ordinarily at breakfast. Then, after being instructed by the Chief Voice about what she was to do upstairs, she bid goodbye to the others, said nothing, walked to the bottom of the stairs, and began going up them without once looking back.

It was quite light, that was one good thing. There was, indeed, a window straight ahead of her at the top of the first flight. As long as she was on that flight she could hear the tick-tock-tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hall below. Then she came to the landing and had to turn to her left up the next flight; after that she couldn’t hear the clock any more.

Now she had come to the top of the stairs. Lucy looked and saw a long, wide passage with a large window at the far end. Apparently the passage ran the whole length of the house. It was carved and panelled and carpeted and very many doors opened off it on each side. She stood still and couldn’t hear the squeak of a mouse, or the buzzing of a fly, or the swaying of a curtain, or anything—except the beating of her own heart.

“The last doorway on the left,” she said to herself. It did seem a bit hard that it should be the last. To reach it she would have to walk past room after room. And in any room there might be the magician—asleep, or awake, or invisible, or even dead. But it wouldn’t do to think about that. She set out on her journey. The carpet was so thick that her feet made no noise.

“There’s nothing whatever to be afraid of yet,” Lucy told herself. And certainly it was a quiet, sunlit passage; perhaps a bit too quiet. It would have been nicer if there had not been strange signs painted in scarlet on the doors—twisty, complicated things which obviously had a meaning and it mightn’t be a very nice meaning either. It would have been nicer still if there weren’t those masks hanging on the wall. Not that they were exactly ugly—or not so very ugly—but the empty eye-holes did look queer, and if you let yourself you would soon start imagining that the masks were doing things as soon as your back was turned to them.

After about the sixth door she got her first real fright. For one second she felt almost certain that a wicked little bearded face had popped out of the wall and made a grimace at her. She forced herself to stop and look at it. And it was not a face at all. It was a little mirror just the size and shape of her own face, with hair on the top of it and a beard hanging down from it, so that when you looked in the mirror your own face fitted into the hair and beard and it looked as if they belonged to you. “I just caught my own reflection with the tail of my eye as I went past,” said Lucy to herself. “That was all it was. It’s quite harmless.” But she didn’t like the look of her own face with that hair and beard, and went on.（I don’t know what the Bearded Glass was for because I am not a magician.）

Before she reached the last door on the left, Lucy was beginning to wonder whether the corridor had grown longer since she began her journey and whether this was part of the magic of the house. But she got to it at last. And the door was open.

It was a large room with three big windows and it was lined from floor to ceiling with books; more books than Lucy had ever seen before, tiny little books, fat and dumpy books, and books bigger than any church Bible you have ever seen, all bound in leather and smelling old and learned and magical. But she knew from her instructions that she need not bother about any of these. For the Book, the Magic Book, was lying on a reading-desk in the very middle of the room. She saw she would have to read it standing（and anyway there were no chairs）and also that she would have to stand with her back to the door while she read it. So at once she turned to shut the door.

It wouldn’t shut.

Some people may disagree with Lucy about this, but I think she was quite right. She said she wouldn’t have minded if she could have shut the door, but that it was unpleasant to have to stand in a place like that with an open doorway right behind your back. I should have felt just the same. But there was nothing else to be done.

One thing that worried her a good deal was the size of the Book. The Chief Voice had not been able to give her any idea whereabouts in the Book the spell for making things visible came. He even seemed rather surprised at her asking. He expected her to begin at the beginning and go on till she came to it; obviously he had never thought that there was any other way of finding a place in a book. “But it might take me days and weeks!” said Lucy, looking at the huge volume, “and I feel already as if I’d been in this place for hours.”

She went up to the desk and laid her hand on the book; her fingers tingled when she touched it as if it were full of electricity. She tried to open it but couldn’t at first; this, however, was only because it was fastened by two leaden clasps, and when she had undone these it opened easily enough. And what a book it was!

It was written, not printed; written in a clear, even hand, with thick downstrokes and thin upstrokes, very large, easier than print, and so beautiful that Lucy stared at it for a whole minute and forgot about reading it. The paper was crisp and smooth and a nice smell came from it; and in the margins, and round the big coloured capital letters at the beginning of each spell, there were pictures.

There was no title page or title; the spells began straight away, and at first there was nothing very important in them. They were cures for warts（by washing your hands in moonlight in a silver basin）and toothache and cramp, and a spell for taking a swarm of bees. The picture of the man with toothache was so lifelike that it would have set your own teeth aching if you looked at it too long, and the golden bees which were dotted all round the fourth spell looked for a moment as if they were really flying.

Lucy could hardly tear herself away from that first page, but when she turned over, the next was just as interesting. “But I must get on,” she told herself. And on she went for about thirty pages which, if she could have remembered them, would have taught her how to find buried treasure, how to remember things forgotten, how to forget things you wanted to forget, how to tell whether anyone was speaking the truth, how to call up（or prevent）wind, fog, snow, sleet or rain, how to produce enchanted sleeps and how to give a man an ass’s head（as they did to poor Bottom）. And the longer she read the more wonderful and more real the pictures became.

Then she came to a page which was such a blaze of pictures that one hardly noticed the writing. Hardly—but she did notice the first words.They were, An infallible spell to make beautiful her that uttereth it beyond the lot of mortals. Lucy peered at the pictures with her face close to the page, and though they had seemed crowded and muddlesome before, she found she could now see them quite clearly. The first was a picture of a girl standing at a reading-desk reading in a huge book. And the girl was dressed exactly like Lucy. In the next picture Lucy（for the girl in the picture was Lucy herself）was standing up with her mouth open and a rather terrible expression on her face, chanting or reciting something. In the third picture the beauty beyond the lot of mortals had come to her. It was strange, considering how small the pictures had looked at first, that the Lucy in the picture now seemed quite as big as the real Lucy; and they looked into each other’s eyes and the real Lucy looked away after a few minutes because she was dazzled by the beauty of the other Lucy; though she could still see a sort of likeness to herself in that beautiful face. And now the pictures came crowding on her thick and fast. She saw herself throned on high at a great tournament in Calormen and all the Kings of the world fought because of her beauty. After that it turned from tournaments to real wars, and all Narnia and Archenland, Telmar and Calormen, Galma and Terebinthia, were laid waste with the fury of the kings and dukes and great lords who fought for her favour. Then it changed and Lucy, still beautiful beyond the lot of mortals, was back in England. And Susan（who had always been the beauty of the family）came home from America. The Susan in the picture looked exactly like the real Susan only plainer and with a nasty expression. And Susan was jealous of the dazzling beauty of Lucy, but that didn’t matter a bit because no one cared anything about Susan now.

“I will say the spell,” said Lucy. “I don’t care. I will.” She said I don’t care because she had a strong feeling that she mustn’t.

But when she looked back at the opening words of the spell, there in the middle of the writing, where she felt quite sure there had been no picture before, she found the great face of a lion, of The Lion, Aslan himself, staring into hers. It was painted such a bright gold that it seemed to be coming towards her out of the page; and indeed she never was quite sure afterwards that it hadn’t really moved a little. At any rate she knew the expression on his face quite well. He was growling and you could see most of his teeth. She became horribly afraid and turned over the page at once.

A little later she came to a spell which would let you know what your friends thought about you. Now Lucy had wanted very badly to try the other spell, the one that made you beautiful beyond the lot of mortals. So she felt that to make up for not having said it, she really would say this one. And all in a hurry, for fear her mind would change, she said the words（nothing will induce me to tell you what they were）. Then she waited for something to happen.

As nothing happened she began looking at the pictures. And all at once she saw the very last thing she expected—a picture of a third-class carriage in a train, with two schoolgirls sitting in it. She knew them at once. They were Marjorie Preston and Anne Featherstone. Only now it was much more than a picture. It was alive. She could see the telegraph posts flicking past outside the window. Then gradually（like when the radio is “coming on”）she could hear what they were saying.

“Shall I see anything of you this term?” said Anne, “or are you still going to be all taken up with Lucy Pevensie.”

“Don’t know what you mean by taken up,” said Marjorie.

“Oh yes, you do,” said Anne. “You were crazy about her last term.”

“No, I wasn’t,” said Marjorie. “I’ve got more sense than that. Not a bad little kid in her way. But I was getting pretty tired of her before the end of term.”

“Well, you jolly well won’t have the chance any other term!” shouted Lucy. “Two-faced little beast.” But the sound of her own voice at once reminded her that she was talking to a picture and that the real Marjorie was far away in another world.

“Well,” said Lucy to herself, “I did think better of her than that. And I did all sorts of things for her last term, and I stuck to her when not many other girls would. And she knows it too. And to Anne Featherstone of all people! I wonder are all my friends the same? There are lots of other pictures. No. I won’t look at any more. I won’t, I won’t”—and with a great effort she turned over the page, but not before a large, angry tear had splashed on it.

On the next page she came to a spell “for the refreshment of the spirit”. The pictures were fewer here but very beautiful. And what Lucy found herself reading was more like a story than a spell. It went on for three pages and before she had read to the bottom of the page she had forgotten that she was reading at all. She was living in the story as if it were real, and all the pictures were real too. When she had got to the third page and come to the end, she said, “That is the loveliest story I’ve ever read or ever shall read in my whole life. Oh, I wish I could have gone on reading it for ten years. At least I’ll read it over again.”

But here part of the magic of the Book came into play. You couldn’t turn back. The right-hand pages, the ones ahead, could be turned; the left-hand pages could not.

“Oh, what a shame!” said Lucy. “I did so want to read it again. Well, at least I must remember it. Let’s see... it was about... about... oh dear, it’s all fading away again. And even this last page is going blank. This is a very queer book. How can I have forgotten? It was about a cup and a sword and a tree and a green hill, I know that much. But I can’t remember and what shall I do?”

And she never could remember; and ever since that day what Lucy means by a good story is a story which reminds her of the forgotten story in the Magician’s Book.

She turned on and found to her surprise a page with no pictures at all; but the first words were A Spell to make hidden things visible. She read it through to make sure of all the hard words and then said it out loud. And she knew at once that it was working because as she spoke the colours came into the capital letters at the top of the page and the pictures began appearing in the margins. It was like when you hold to the fire something written in Invisible Ink and the writing gradually shows up; only instead of the dingy colour of lemon juice（which is the easiest Invisible Ink）this was all gold and blue and scarlet. They were odd pictures and contained many figures that Lucy did not much like the look of. And then she thought, “I suppose I’ve made everything visible, and not only the Thumpers. There might be lots of other invisible things hanging about a place like this. I’m not sure that I want to see them all.”

At that moment she heard soft, heavy footfalls coming along the corridor behind her; and of course she remembered what she had been told about the Magician walking in his bare feet and making no more noise than a cat. It is always better to turn round than to have anything creeping up behind your back. Lucy did so.

Then her face lit up till, for a moment（but of course she didn’t know it）, she looked almost as beautiful as that other Lucy in the picture, and she ran forward with a little cry of delight and with her arms stretched out. For what stood in the doorway was Aslan himself, The Lion, the highest of all High Kings. And he was solid and real and warm and he let her kiss him and bury herself in his shining mane. And from the low, earthquake-like sound that came from inside him, Lucy even dared to think that he was purring.

“Oh, Aslan,” said she, “it was kind of you to come.”

“I have been here all the time,” said he, “but you have just made me visible.”

“Aslan!” said Lucy almost a little reproachfully. “Don’t make fun of me. As if anything I could do would make you visible!”

“It did,” said Aslan. “Do you think I wouldn’t obey my own rules?” After a little pause he spoke again.

“Child,” he said, “I think you have been eavesdropping.”

“Eavesdropping?”

“You listened to what your two schoolfellows were saying about you.”

“Oh that? I never thought that was eavesdropping, Aslan. Wasn’t it magic?”

“Spying on people by magic is the same as spying on them in any other way. And you have misjudged your friend. She is weak, but she loves you. She was afraid of the older girl and said what she does not mean.”

“I don’t think I’d ever be able to forget what I heard her say.”

“No, you won’t.”

“Oh dear,” said Lucy. “Have I spoiled everything? Do you mean we would have gone on being friends if it hadn’t been for this—and been really great friends—all our lives perhaps—and now we never shall.”

“Child,” said Aslan, “did I not explain to you once before that no one is ever told what would have happened?”

“Yes, Aslan, you did,” said Lucy. “I’m sorry. But please—”

“Speak on, dear heart.”

“Shall I ever be able to read that story again; the one I couldn’t remember? Will you tell it to me, Aslan? Oh do, do, do.”

“Indeed, yes, I will tell it to you for years and years. But now, come. We must meet the master of this house.”





CHAPTER ELEVEN:

THE DUFFLEPUDS MADE HAPPY


LUCY followed the great Lion out into the passage and at once she saw coming towards them an old man, barefoot, dressed in a red robe. His white hair was crowned with a chaplet of oak leaves, his beard fell to his girdle, and he supported himself with a curiously carved staff. When he saw Aslan he bowed low and said,

“Welcome, Sir, to the least of your houses.”

“Do you grow weary, Coriakin, of ruling such foolish subjects as I have given you here?”

“No,” said the Magician, “they are very stupid but there is no real harm in them. I begin to grow rather fond of the creatures. Sometimes, perhaps, I am a little impatient, waiting for the day when they can be governed by wisdom instead of this rough magic.”

“All in good time, Coriakin,” said Aslan.

“Yes, all in very good time, Sir,” was the answer. “Do you intend to show yourself to them?”

“Nay,” said the Lion, with a little half-growl that meant（Lucy thought）the same as a laugh. “I should frighten them out of their senses. Many stars will grow old and come to take their rest in islands before your people are ripe for that. And today before sunset I must visit Trumpkin the Dwarf where he sits in the castle of Cair Paravel counting the days till his master Caspian comes home. I will tell him all your story, Lucy. Do not look so sad. We shall meet soon again.”

“Please, Aslan,” said Lucy, “what do you call soon?”

“I call all times soon,” said Aslan; and instantly he was vanished away and Lucy was alone with the Magician.

“Gone!” said he, “and you and I quite crestfallen. It’s always like that, you can’t keep him; it’s not as if he were a tame lion. And how did you enjoy my book?”

“Parts of it very much indeed,” said Lucy. “Did you know I was there all the time?”

“Well, of course I knew when I let the Duffers make themselves invisible that you would be coming along presently to take the spell off. I wasn’t quite sure of the exact day. And I wasn’t especially on the watch this morning. You see they had made me invisible too and being invisible always makes me so sleepy. Heigh-ho—there I’m yawning again. Are you hungry?”

“Well, perhaps I am a little,” said Lucy. “I’ve no idea what the time is.”

“Come,” said the Magician. “All times may be soon to Aslan; but in my home all hungry times are one o’clock.”

He led her a little way down the passage and opened a door. Passing in, Lucy found herself in a pleasant room full of sunlight and flowers. The table was bare when they entered, but it was of course a magic table, and at a word from the old man the tablecloth, silver, plates, glasses and food appeared.

“I hope that is what you would like,” said he. “I have tried to give you food more like the food of your own land than perhaps you have had lately.”

“It’s lovely,” said Lucy, and so it was; an omelette, piping hot, cold lamb and green peas, a strawberry ice, lemon-squash to drink with the meal and a cup of chocolate to follow. But the magician himself drank only wine and ate only bread. There was nothing alarming about him, and Lucy and he were soon chatting away like old friends.

“When will the spell work?” asked Lucy. “Will the Duffers be visible again at once?”

“Oh yes, they’re visible now. But they’re probably all asleep still; they always take a rest in the middle of the day.”

“And now that they’re visible, are you going to let them off being ugly? Will you make them as they were before?”

“Well, that’s rather a delicate question,” said the Magician. “You see, it’s only they who think they were so nice to look at before. They say they’ve been uglified, but that isn’t what I called it. Many people might say the change was for the better.”

“Are they awfully conceited?”

“They are. Or at least the Chief Duffer is, and he’s taught all the rest to be. They always believe every word he says.”

“We’d noticed that,” said Lucy.

“Yes—we’d get on better without him, in a way. Of course I could turn him into something else, or even put a spell on him which would make them not believe a word he said. But I don’t like to do that. It’s better for them to admire him than to admire nobody.”

“Don’t they admire you?” asked Lucy.

“Oh, not me,” said the Magician. “They wouldn’t admire me.”

“What was it you uglified them for—I mean, what they call uglified?”

“Well, they wouldn’t do what they were told. Their work is to mind the garden and raise food—not for me, as they imagine, but for themselves.They wouldn’t do it at all if I didn’t make them. And of course for a garden you want water. There is a beautiful spring about half a mile away up the hill. And from that spring there flows a stream which comes right past the garden. All I asked them to do was to take their water from the stream instead of trudging up to the spring with their buckets two or three times a day and tiring themselves out besides spilling half of it on the way back. But they wouldn’t see it. In the end they refused point blank.”

“Are they as stupid as all that?” asked Lucy.

The Magician sighed. “You wouldn’t believe the troubles I’ve had with them. A few months ago they were all for washing up the plates and knives before dinner: they said it saved time afterwards. I’ve caught them planting boiled potatoes to save cooking them when they were dug up. One day the cat got into the dairy and twenty of them were at work moving all the milk out; no one thought of moving the cat. But I see you’ve finished. Let’s go and look at the Duffers now they can be looked at.”

They went into another room which was full of polished instruments hard to understand—such as Astrolabes, Orreries, Chronoscopes, Poesimeters, Choriambuses and Theodolinds—and here, when they had come to the window, the Magician said, “There. There are your Duffers.”

“I don’t see anybody,” said Lucy. “And what are those mushroom things?”

The things she pointed at were dotted all over the level grass. They were certainly very like mushrooms, but far too big—the stalks about three feet high and the umbrellas about the same length from edge to edge. When she looked carefully she noticed too that the stalks joined the umbrellas not in the middle but at one side which gave an unbalanced look to them. And there was something—a sort of little bundle—lying on the grass at the foot of each stalk. In fact the longer she gazed at them the less like mushrooms they appeared. The umbrella part was not really round as she had thought at first. It was longer than it was broad, and it widened at one end. There were a great many of them, fifty or more.

The clock struck three.

Instantly a most extraordinary thing happened. Each of the“mushrooms” suddenly turned upside-down. The little bundles which had lain at the bottom of the stalks were heads and bodies. The stalks themselves were legs. But not two legs to each body. Each body had a single thick leg right under it（not to one side like the leg of a one-legged man）and at the end of it, a single enormous foot—a broad-toed foot with the toes curling up a little so that it looked rather like a small canoe. She saw in a moment why they had looked like mushrooms. They had been lying flat on their backs each with its single leg straight up in the air and its enormous foot spread out above it. She learned afterwards that this was their ordinary way of resting; for the foot kept off both rain and sun and for a Monopod to lie under its own foot is almost as good as being in a tent.

“Oh, the funnies, the funnies,” cried Lucy, bursting into laughter. “Did you make them like that?”

“Yes, yes. I made the Duffers into Monopods,” said the Magician. He too was laughing till the tears ran down his cheeks. “But watch,” he added.

It was worth watching. Of course these little one-footed men couldn’t walk or run as we do. They got about by jumping, like fleas or frogs. And what jumps they made!—as if each big foot were a mass of springs. And with what a bounce they came down; that was what made the thumping noise which had so puzzled Lucy yesterday. For now they were jumping in all directions and calling out to one another, “Hey, lads! We’re visible again.”

“Visible we are,” said one in a tasselled red cap who was obviously the Chief Monopod. “And what I say is, when chaps are visible, why, they can see one another.”

“Ah, there it is, there it is, Chief,” cried all the others. “There’s the point. No one’s got a clearer head than you. You couldn’t have made it plainer.”

“She caught the old man napping, that little girl did,” said the Chief Monopod. “We’ve beaten him this time.”

“Just what we were, going to say ourselves,” chimed the chorus.“You’re going stronger than ever today, Chief. Keep it up, keep it up.”

“But do they dare to talk about you like that?” said Lucy. “They seemed to be so afraid of you yesterday. Don’t they know you might be listening?”

“That’s one of the funny things about the Duffers,” said the Magician. “One minute they talk as if I ran everything and overheard everything and was extremely dangerous. The next moment they think they can take me in by tricks that a baby would see through—bless them!”

“Will they have to be turned back into their proper shapes?” asked Lucy. “Oh, I do hope it wouldn’t be unkind to leave them as they are. Do they really mind very much? They seem pretty happy. I say—look at that jump. What were they like before?”

“Common little dwarfs,” said he. “Nothing like so nice as the sort you have in Narnia.”

“It would be a pity to change them back,” said Lucy. “They’re so funny: and they’re rather nice. Do you think it would make any difference if I told them that?”

“I’m sure it would—if you could get it into their heads.”

“Will you come with me and try?”

“No, no. You’ll get on far better without me.”

“Thanks awfully for the lunch,” said Lucy and turned quickly away. She ran down the stairs which she had come up so nervously that morning and cannoned into Edmund at the bottom. All the others were there with him waiting, and Lucy’s conscience smote her when she saw their anxious faces and realized how long she had forgotten them.

“It’s all right,” she shouted. “Everything’s all right. The Magician’s a brick—and I’ve seen Him—Aslan.”

After that she went from them like the wind and out into the garden. Here the earth was shaking with the jumps and the air ringing with the shouts of the Monopods. Both were redoubled when they caught sight of her.

“Here she comes, here she comes,” they cried. “Three cheers for the little girl. Ah! She put it across the old gentleman properly, she did.”

“And we’re extremely regrettable,” said the Chief Monopod, “that we can’t give you the pleasure of seeing us as we were before we were uglified, for you wouldn’t believe the difference, and that’s the truth, for there’s no denying we’re mortal ugly now, so we won’t deceive you.”

“Eh, that we are, Chief, that we are,” echoed the others, bouncing like so many toy balloons. “You’ve said it, you’ve said it.”

“But I don’t think you are at all,” said Lucy, shouting to make herself heard. “I think you look very nice.”

“Hear her, hear her,” said the Monopods. “True for you, Missie. Very nice we look. You couldn’t find a handsomer lot.” They said this without any surprise and did not seem to notice that they had changed their minds.

“She’s a-saying,” remarked the Chief Monopod, “as how we looked very nice before we were uglified.”

“True for you, Chief, true for you,” chanted the others. “That’s what she says. We heard her ourselves.”

“I did not,” bawled Lucy. “I said you’re very nice now.”

“So she did, so she did,” said the Chief Monopod, “said we were very nice then.”

“Hear ’em both, hear ’em both,” said the Monopods. “There’s a pair for you. Always right. They couldn’t have put it better.”

“But we’re saying just the opposite,” said Lucy, stamping her foot with impatience.

“So you are, to be sure, so you are,” said the Monopods. “Nothing like an opposite. Keep it up, both of you.”

“You’re enough to drive anyone mad,” said Lucy, and gave it up. But the Monopods seemed perfectly contented, and she decided that on the whole the conversation had been a success.

And before everyone went to bed that evening something else happened which made them even more satisfied with their one-legged condition. Caspian and all the Narnians went back as soon as possible to the shore to give their news to Rhince and the others on board the Dawn Treader, who were by now very anxious. And, of course, the Monopods went with them, bouncing like footballs and agreeing with one another in loud voices till Eustace said, “I wish the Magician would make them inaudible instead of invisible.”（He was soon sorry he had spoken because then he had to explain that an inaudible thing is something you can’t hear, and though he took a lot of trouble he never felt sure that the Monopods had really understood, and what especially annoyed him was that they said in the end, “Eh, he can’t put things the way our Chief does. But you’ll learn, young man. Hark to him. He’ll show you how to say things. There’s a speaker for you!”）When they reached the bay, Reepicheep had a brilliant idea. He had his little coracle lowered and paddled himself about in it till the Monopods were thoroughly interested. He then stood up in it and said, “Worthy and intelligent Monopods, you do not need boats. Each of you has a foot that will do instead. Just jump as lightly as you can on the water and see what happens.”

The Chief Monopod hung back and warned the others that they’d find the water powerful wet, but one or two of the younger ones tried it almost at once; and then a few others followed their example, and at last the whole lot did the same. It worked perfectly. The huge single foot of a Monopod acted as a natural raft or boat, and when Reepicheep had taught them how to cut rude paddles for themselves, they all paddled about the bay and round the Dawn Treader, looking for all the world like a fleet of little canoes with a fat dwarf standing up in the extreme stern of each. And they had races, and bottles of wine were lowered down to them from the ship as prizes, and the sailors stood leaning over the ship’s sides and laughed till their own sides ached.

The Duffers were also very pleased with their new name of Monopods, which seemed to them a magnificent name though they never got it right. “That’s what we are,” they bellowed, “Moneypuds, Pomonods, Poddymons. Just what it was on the tips of our tongue to call ourselves.” But they soon got it mixed up with their old name of Duffers and finally settled down to calling themselves the Dufflepuds; and that is what they will probably be called for centuries.

That evening all the Narnians dined upstairs with the Magician, and Lucy noticed how different the whole top floor looked now that she was no longer afraid of it. The mysterious signs on the doors were still mysterious but now looked as if they had kind and cheerful meanings, and even the bearded mirror now seemed funny rather than frightening. At dinner everyone had by magic what everyone liked best to eat and drink, and after dinner the Magician did a very useful and beautiful piece of magic. He laid two blank sheets of parchment on the table and asked Drinian to give him an exact account of their voyage up to date: and as Drinian spoke, everything he described came out on the parchment in fine clear lines till at last each sheet was a splendid map of the Eastern Ocean, showing Galma, Terebinthia, the Seven Isles, the Lone Islands, Dragon Island, Burnt Island, Deathwater, and the land of the Duffers itself, all exactly the right sizes and in the right positions. They were the first maps ever made of those seas and better than any that have been made since without magic. For on these, though the towns and mountains looked at first just as they would on an ordinary map, when the Magician lent them a magnifying glass you saw that they were perfect little pictures of the real things, so that you could see the very castle and slave market and streets in Narrowhaven, all very clear though very distant, like things seen through the wrong end of a telescope. The only drawback was that the coastline of most of the islands was incomplete, for the map showed only what Drinian had seen with his own eyes. When they were finished the. Magician kept one himself and presented the other to Caspian: it still hangs in his Chamber of Instruments at Cair Paravel. But the Magician could tell them nothing about seas or lands further east. He did, however, tell them that about seven years before a Narnian ship had put in at his waters and that she had on board the lords Revilian, Argoz, Mavramorn and Rhoop: so they judged that the golden man they had seen lying in Deathwater must be the Lord Restimar.

Next day, the Magician magically mended the stern of the Dawn Treaderwhere it had been damaged by the Sea Serpent and loaded her with useful gifts. There was a most friendly parting, and when she sailed, two hours after noon, all the Dufflepuds paddled out with her to the harbour mouth, and cheered until she was out of sound of their cheering.





CHAPTER TWELVE:

THE DARK ISLAND


AFTER this adventure they sailed on south and a little east for twelve days with a gentle wind, the skies being mostly clear and the air warm, and saw no bird or fish, except that once there were whales spouting a long way to starboard. Lucy and Reepicheep played a good deal of chess at this time. Then on the thirteenth day, Edmund, from the fighting-top, sighted what looked like a great dark mountain rising out of the sea on their port bow.

They altered course and made for this land, mostly by oar, for the wind would not serve them to sail northeast. When evening fell they were still a long way from it and rowed all night. Next morning the weather was fair but a flat calm. The dark mass lay ahead, much nearer and larger, but still very dim, so that some thought it was still a long way off and others thought they were running into a mist.

About nine that morning, very suddenly, it was so close that they could see that it was not land at all, nor even, in an ordinary sense, a mist. It was a Darkness. It is rather hard to describe, but you will see what it was like if you imagine yourself looking into the mouth of a railway tunnel—a tunnel either so long or so twisty that you cannot see the light at the far end. And you know what it would be like. For a few feet you would see the rails and sleepers and gravel in broad daylight; then there would come a place where they were in twilight; and then, pretty suddenly, but of course without a sharp dividing line, they would vanish altogether into smooth, solid blackness. It was just so here. For a few feet in front of their bows they could see the swell of the bright greenish-blue water. Beyond that, they could see the water looking pale and grey as it would look late in the evening. But beyond that again, utter blackness as if they had come to the edge of moonless and starless night.

Caspian shouted to the boatswain to keep her back, and all except the rowers rushed forward and gazed from the bows. But there was nothing to be seen by gazing. Behind them was the sea and the sun, before them the Darkness.

“Do we go into this?” asked Caspian at length.

“Not by my advice,” said Drinian.

“The Captain’s right,” said several sailors.

“I almost think he is,” said Edmund.

Lucy and Eustace didn’t speak but they felt very glad inside at the turn things seemed to be taking. But all at once the clear voice of Reepicheep broke in upon the silence.

“And why not?” he said. “Will someone explain to me why not.”

No one was anxious to explain, so Reepicheep continued:

“If I were addressing peasants or slaves,” he said, “I might suppose that this suggestion proceeded from cowardice. But I hope it will never be told in Narnia that a company of noble and royal persons in the flower of their age turned tail because they were afraid of the dark.”

“But what manner of use would it be ploughing through that blackness?” asked Drinian.

“Use?” replied Reepicheep. “Use, Captain? If by use you mean filling our bellies or our purses, I confess it will be no use at all. So far as I know we did not set sail to look for things useful but to seek honour and adventure. And here is as great an adventure as ever I heard of, and here, if we turn back, no tittle impeachment of all our honours.”

Several of the sailors said things under their breath that sounded like“Honour be blowed”, but Caspian said:

“Oh, bother you, Reepicheep. I almost wish we’d left you at home. All right! If you put it that way, I suppose we shall have to go on. Unless Lucy would rather not?”

Lucy felt that she would very much rather not, but what she said out loud was, “I’m game.”

“Your Majesty will at least order lights?” said Drinian.

“By all means,” said Caspian. “See to it, Captain.”

So the three lanterns, at the stern, and the prow and the masthead, were all lit, and Drinian ordered two torches amidships. Pale and feeble they looked in the sunshine. Then all the men except some who were left below at the oars were ordered on deck and fully armed and posted in their battle stations with swords drawn. Lucy and two archers were posted on the fighting-top with bows bent and arrows on the string. Rynelf was in the bows with his line ready to take soundings. Reepicheep, Edmund, Eustace and Caspian, glittering in mail, were with him. Drinian took the tiller.

“And now, in Aslan’s name, forward!” cried Caspian. “A slow, steady stroke. And let every man be silent and keep his ears open for orders.”

With a creak and a groan the Dawn Treader started to creep forward as the men began to row. Lucy, up in the fighting-top, had a wonderful view of the exact moment at which they entered the darkness. The bows had already disappeared before the sunlight had left the stern. She saw it go. At one minute the gilded stern, the blue sea, and the sky, were all in broad daylight: next minute the sea and sky had vanished, the stern lantern—which had been hardly noticeable before—was the only thing to show where the ship ended. In front of the lantern she could see the black shape of Drinian crouching at the tiller. Down below her the two torches made visible two small patches of deck and gleamed on swords and helmets, and forward there was another island of light on the forecastle. Apart from that, the fighting-top, lit by the masthead light which was only just above her, seemed to be a little lighted world of its own floating in lonely darkness. And the lights themselves, as always happens with lights when you have to have them at the wrong time of day, looked lurid and unnatural. She also noticed that she was very cold.

How long this voyage into the darkness lasted, nobody knew. Except for the creak of the rowlocks and the splash of the oars there was nothing to show that they were moving at all. Edmund, peering from the bows, could see nothing except the reflection of the lantern in the water before him. It looked a greasy sort of reflection, and the ripple made by their advancing prow appeared to be heavy, small, and lifeless. As time went on everyone except the rowers began to shiver with cold.

Suddenly, from somewhere—no one’s sense of direction was very clear by now—there came a cry, either of some inhuman voice or else a voice of one in such extremity of terror that he had almost lost his humanity.

Caspian was still trying to speak—his mouth was too dry—when the shrill voice of Reepicheep, which sounded louder than usual in that silence, was heard.

“Who calls?” it piped. “If you are a foe we do not fear you, and if you are a friend your enemies shall be taught the fear of us.”

“Mercy!” cried the voice. “Mercy! Even if you are only one more dream, have mercy. Take me on board. Take me, even if you strike me dead. But in the name of all mercies do not fade away and leave me in this horrible land.”

“Where are you?” shouted Caspian. “Come aboard and welcome.”

There came another cry, whether of joy or terror, and then they knew that someone was swimming towards them.

“Stand by to heave him up, men,” said Caspian.

“Aye, aye, your Majesty,” said the sailors. Several crowded to the port bulwark with ropes and one, leaning far out over the side, held the torch. A wild, white face appeared in the blackness of the water, and then, after some scrambling and pulling, a dozen friendly hands had heaved the stranger on board.

Edmund thought he had never seen a wilder-looking man. Though he did not otherwise look very old, his hair was an untidy mop of white, his face was thin and drawn, and, for clothing, only a few wet rags hung about him. But what one mainly noticed were his eyes, which were so widely opened that he seemed to have no eyelids at all, and stared as if in an agony of pure fear. The moment his feet reached the deck he said:

“Fly! Fly! About with your ship and fly! Row, row, row for your lives away from this accursed shore.”

“Compose yourself,” said Reepicheep, “and tell us what the danger is. We are not used to flying.”

The stranger started horribly at the voice of the Mouse, which he had not noticed before.

“Nevertheless you will fly from here,” he gasped. “This is the Island where Dreams come true.”

“That’s the island I’ve been looking for this long time,” said one of the sailors. “I rockon I’d find I was married to Nancy if we landed here.”

“And I’d find Tom alive again,” said another.

“Fools!” said the man, stamping his foot with rage. “That is the sort of talk that brought me here, and I’d better have been drowned or never born. Do you hear what I say? This is where dreams—dreams, do you understand—come to life, come real. Not daydreams: dreams.”

There was about half a minute’s silence and then, with a great clatter of armour, the whole crew were tumbling down the main hatch as quick as they could and flinging themselves on the oars to row as they had never rowed before; and Drinian was swinging round the tiller, and the boatswain was giving out the quickest stroke that had ever been heard at sea. For it had taken everyone just that half-minute to remember certain dreams they had had—dreams that make you afraid of going to sleep again—and to realize what it would mean to land on a country where dreams come true.

Only Reepicheep remained unmoved.

“Your Majesty, your Majesty,” he said, “are you going to tolerate this mutiny, this poltroonery? This is a panic, this is a rout.”

“Row, row,” bellowed Caspian. “Pull for all our lives. Is her head right, Drinian? You can say what you like, Reepicheep. There are some things no man can face.”

“It is, then, my good fortune not to be a man,” replied Reepicheep with a very stiff bow.

Lucy from up aloft had heard it all. In an instant that one of her own dreams which she had tried hardest to forget came back to her as vividly as if she had only just woken from it. So that was what was behind them, on the island, in the darkness! For a second she wanted to go down to the deck and be with Edmund and Caspian. But what was the use? If dreams began coming true, Edmund and Caspian themselves might turn into something horrible just as she reached them. She gripped the rail of the fighting-top and tried to steady herself. They were rowing back to the light as hard as they could: it would be all right in a few seconds. But oh, if only it could be all right now!

Though the rowing made a good deal of noise it did not quite conceal the total silence which surrounded the ship. Everyone knew it would be better not to listen, not to strain his ears for any sound from the darkness. But no one could help listening. And soon everyone was hearing things. Each one heard something different.

“Do you hear a noise like... like a huge pair of scissors opening and shutting... over there?” Eustace asked Rynelf.

“Hush!” said Rynelf. “I can hear them crawling up the sides of the ship.”

“It’s just going to settle on the mast,” said Caspian.

“Ugh!” said a sailor. “There are the gongs beginning. I knew they would.”

Caspian, trying not to look at anything（especially not to keep looking behind him）, went aft to Drinian.

“Drinian,” he said in a very low voice. “How long did we take rowing in?—I mean rowing to where we picked up . the stranger.”

“Five minutes, perhaps,” whispered Drinian. “Why?”

“Because we’ve been more than that already trying to get out.”

Drinian’s hand shook on the tiller and a line of cold sweat ran down his face. The same idea was occurring to everyone on board. “We shall never get out, never get out,” moaned the rowers. “He’s steering us wrong. We’re going round and round in circles. We shall never get out.” The stranger, who had been lying in a huddled heap on the deck, sat up and burst out into a horrible screaming laugh.

“Never get out!” he yelled. “That’s it. Of course. We shall never get out. What a fool I was to have thought they would let me go as easily as that. No, no, we shall never get out.”

Lucy leant her head on the edge of the fighting-top and whispered,“Aslan, Aslan, if ever you loved us at all, send us help now.” The darkness did not grow any less, but she began to feel a little—a very, very little—better. “After all, nothing has really happened to us yet,” she thought.

“Look!” cried Rynelf’s voice hoarsely from the bows. There was a tiny speck of light ahead, and while they watched a broad beam of light fell from it upon the ship. It did not alter the surrounding darkness, but the whole ship was lit up as if by searchlight. Caspian blinked, stared round, saw the faces of his companions all with wild, fixed expressions. Everyone was staring in the same direction: behind everyone lay his black, sharply edged shadow.

Lucy looked along the beam and presently saw something in it. At first it looked like a cross, then it looked like an aeroplane, then it looked like a kite, and at last with a whirring of wings it was right overhead and was an albatross. It circled three times round the mast and then perched for an instant on the crest of the gilded dragon at the prow. It called out in a strong sweet voice what seemed to be words though no one understood them. After that it spread its wings, rose, and began to fly slowly ahead, bearing a little to starboard. Drinian steered after it not doubting that it offered good guidance. But no one except Lucy knew that as it circled the mast it had whispered to her, “Courage, dear heart,” and the voice, she felt sure, was Aslan’s, and with the voice a delicious smell breathed in her face.

In a few moments the darkness turned into a greyness ahead, and then, almost before they dared to begin hoping, they had shot out into the sunlight and were in the warm, blue world again. And all at once everybody realized that there was nothing to be afraid of and never had been. They blinked their eyes and looked about them. The brightness of the ship herself astonished them: they had half expected to find that the darkness would cling to the white and the green and the gold in the form of some grime or scum. And then first one, and then another, began laughing.

“I reckon we’ve made pretty good fools of ourselves,” said Rynelf.

Lucy lost no time in coming down to the deck, where she found the others all gathered round the newcomer. For a long time he was too happy to speak, and could only gaze at the sea and the sun and feel the bulwarks and the ropes, as if to make sure he was really awake, while tears rolled down his cheeks.

“Thank you,” he said at last. “You have saved me from... but I won’t talk of that. And now let me know who you are. I am a Telmarine of Narnia, and when I was worth anything men called me the Lord Rhoop.”

“And I,” said Caspian, “am Caspian, King of Narnia, and I sail to find you and your companions who were my father’s friends.”

Lord Rhoop fell on his knees and kissed the King’s hand. “Sire,” he said, “you are the man in all the world I most wished to see. Grant me a boon.”

“What is it?” asked Caspian.

“Never to bring me back there,” he said. He pointed astern. They all looked. But they saw only bright blue sea and bright blue sky. The Dark Island and the darkness had vanished for ever.

“Why!” cried Lord Rhoop. “You have destroyed it!”

“I don’t think it was us,” said Lucy.

“Sire,” said Drinian, “this wind is fair for the southeast. Shall I have our poor fellows up and set sail? And after that, every man who can be spared, to his hammock.”

“Yes,” said Caspian, “and let there be grog all round. Heigh-ho, I feel I could sleep the clock round myself.”

So all afternoon with great joy they sailed southeast with a fair wind. But nobody noticed when the albatross had disappeared.





CHAPTER THIRTEEN:

THE THREE SLEEPERS


THE wind never failed but it grew gentler every day till at length the waves were little more than ripples, and the ship glided on hour after hour almost as if they were sailing on a lake. And every night they saw that there rose in the east new constellations which no one had ever seen in Narnia and perhaps, as Lucy thought with a mixture of joy and fear, no living eye had seen at all. Those new stars were big and bright and the nights were warm. Most of them slept on deck and talked far into the night or hung over the ship’s side watching the luminous dance of the foam thrown up by their bows.

On an evening of startling beauty, when the sunset behind them was so crimson and purple and widely spread that the very sky itself seemed to have grown larger, they came in sight of land on their starboard bow. It came slowly nearer and the light behind them made it look as if the capes and headlands of this new country were all on fire. But presently they were sailing along its coast and its western cape now rose up astern of them, black against the red sky and sharp as if it was cut out of cardboard, and then they could see better what this country was like. It had no mountains but many gentle hills with slopes like pillows. An attractive smell came from it—what Lucy called “a dim, purple kind of smell”, which Edmund said（and Rhince thought）was rot, but Caspian said, “I know what you mean.”

They sailed on a good way, past point after point, hoping to find a nice deep harbour, but had to content themselves in the end with a wide and shallow bay. Though it had seemed calm out at sea there was of course surf breaking on the sand and they could not bring the Dawn Treader as far in as they would have liked. They dropped anchor a good way from the beach and had a wet and tumbling landing in the boat. The Lord Rhoop remained on board the Dawn Treader. He wished to see no more islands. All the time that they remained in this country the sound of the long breakers was in their ears.

Two men were left to guard the boat and Caspian led the others inland, but not far because it was too late for exploring and the light would soon go. But there was no need to go far to find an adventure. The level valley which lay at the head of the bay showed no road or track or other sign of habitation. Underfoot was tine springy turf dotted here and there with a low bushy growth which Edmund and Lucy took for heather. Eustace, who was really rather good at botany; said it wasn’t, and he was probably right; but it was something of very much the same kind.

When they had gone less than a bowshot from the shore, Drinian said, “Look! What’s that?” and everyone stopped.

“Are they great trees?” said Caspian.

“Towers, l think,” said Eustace.

“It might be giants,” said Edmund in a lower voice.

“The way to find out is to go right in among them,” said Reepicheep, drawing his sword and pattering off ahead of everyone else.

“I think it’s a ruin,” said Lucy when they had got a good deal nearer, and her guess was the best so far. What they now saw was a wide oblong space flagged with smooth stones and surrounded by grey pillars but unroofed. And from end to end of it ran a long table laid with a rich crimson cloth that came down nearly to the pavement. At either side of it were many chairs of stone richly carved and with silken cushions upon the seats. But on the table itself there was set out such a banquet as had never been seen, not even when Peter the High King kept his court at Cair Paravel. There were turkeys and geese and peacocks, there were boars’ heads and sides of venison, there were pies shaped like ships under full sail or like dragons and elephants, there were ice puddings and bright lobsters and gleaming salmon, there were nuts and grapes, pineapples and peaches, pomegranates and melons and tomatoes. There were flagons of gold and silver and curiously-wrought glass; and the smell of the fruit and the wine blew towards them like a promise of all happiness.

“I say!” said Lucy.

They came nearer and nearer, all very quietly.

“But where are the guests?” asked Eustace.

“We can provide that, Sir,” said Rhince.

“Look!” said Edmund sharply. They were actually within the pillars now and standing on the pavement. Everyone looked where Edmund had pointed. The chairs were not all empty. At the head of the table and in the two places beside it there was something—or possibly three somethings.

“What are those?” asked Lucy in a whisper. “It looks like three beavers sitting on the table.”

“Or a huge bird’s nest,” said Edmund.

“It looks more like a haystack to me,” said Caspian.

Reepicheep ran forward, jumped on a chair and thence on to the table, and ran along it, threading his way as nimbly as a dancer between jewelled cups and pyramids of fruit and ivory salt-cellars. He ran right up to the mysterious grey mass at the end: peered, touched, and then called out:

“These will not fight, I think.”

Everyone now came close and saw that what sat in those three chairs was three men, though hard to recognize as men till you looked closely. Their hair, which was grey, had grown over their eyes till it almost concealed their, faces, and their beards had grown over the table, climbing round and entwining plates and goblets as brambles; entwine a fence, until, all mixed in one great mat of hair, they flowed over the edge and down to the floor. And from their heads the hair hung over the backs of their chairs so that they were wholly hidden. In fact the three men were nearly all hair.

“Dead?” said Caspian.

“I think not, Sire,” said Reepicheep, lifting one of their hands out of its tangle of hair in his two paws. “This one is warm and his pulse beats.”

“This one, too, and this,” said Drinian. “Why, they’re only asleep,” said Eustace.

“It’s been a long sleep, though,” said Edmund, “to let their hair grow like this.”

“It must be an enchanted sleep,” said Lucy. “I felt the moment we landed on this island that it was full of magic. Oh! do you think we have perhaps come here to break it?”

“We can try,” said Caspian, and began shaking the nearest of the three sleepers. For a moment everyone thought he was going to be successful, for the man breathed hard and muttered, “I’ll go eastward no more. Out oars for Narnia.” But he sank back almost at once into a yet deeper sleep than before: that is, his heavy head sagged a few inches lower towards the table and all efforts to rouse him again were useless. With the second it was much the same. “Weren’t born to live like animals.Get to the east while you’ve a chance—lands behind the sun,” and sank down. And the third only said, “Mustard, please,” and slept hard.

“Out oars for Narnia, eh?” said Drinian.

“Yes,” said Caspian, “you are right, Drinian. I think our quest is at an end. Let’s look at their rings. Yes, these are their devices. This is the Lord Revilian. This is the Lord Argoz: and this, the Lord Mavramorn.”

“But we can’t wake them,” said Lucy. “What are we to do?”

“Begging your Majesties’ pardons all,” said Rhince, “but why not fall to while you’re discussing it? We don’t see a dinner like this every day.”

“Not for your life!” said Caspian.

“That’s right, that’s right,” said several of the sailors.

“Too much magic about here. The sooner we’re back on board the better.”

“Depend upon it,” said Reepicheep, “it was from eating this food that these three lords came by a seven years’ sleep.”

“I wouldn’t touch it to save my life,” said Drinian.

“The light’s going uncommon quick,” said Rynelf.

“Back to ship, back to ship,” muttered the men.

“I really think,” said Edmund, “they’re right. We can decide what to do with the three sleepers tomorrow. We daren’t eat the food and there’s no point in staying here for the night. The whole place smells of magic—and danger.”

“I am entirely of King Edmund’s opinion,” said Reepicheep, “as far as concerns the ship’s company in general. But I myself will sit at this table till sunrise.”

“Why on earth?” said Eustace.

“Because,” said the Mouse, “this is a very great adventure, and no danger seems to me so great as that of knowing when I get back to Narnia that I left a mystery behind me through fear.”

“I’ll stay with you, Reep,” said Edmund.

“And I too,” said Caspian.

“And me,” said Lucy. And then Eustace volunteered also. This was very brave of him because never having read of such things or even heard of them till he joined the Dawn Treader made it worse for him than for the others.

“I beseech your Majesty—” began Drinian.

“No, my Lord,” said Caspian. “Your place is with the ship, and you have had a day’s work while we five have idled.” There was a lot of argument about this but in the end Caspian had his way. As the crew marched off to the shore in the gathering dusk none of the five watchers, except perhaps Reepicheep, could avoid a cold feeling in the stomach.

They took some time choosing their seats at the perilous table. Probably everyone had the same reason but no one said it out loud. For it was really a rather nasty choice. One could hardly bear to sit all night next to those three terrible hairy objects which, if not dead, were certainly not alive in the ordinary sense. On the other hand, to sit at the far end, so that you would see them less and less as the night grew darker, and wouldn’t know if they were moving, and perhaps wouldn’t see them at all by about two o’clock—no, it was not to be thought of. So they sauntered round and round the table saying, “What about here?” and “Or perhaps a bit further on,” or, “Why not on this side?” till at last they settled down somewhere about the middle but nearer to the sleepers than to the other end. It was about ten by now and almost dark. Those strange new constellations burned in the east. Lucy would have liked it better if they had been the Leopard and the Ship and other old friends of the Narnian sky.

They wrapped themselves in their sea cloaks and sat still and waited.At first there was some attempt at talk but it didn’t come to much. And they sat and sat. And all the time they heard the waves breaking on the beach.

After hours that seemed like ages there came a moment when they all knew they had been dozing a moment before but were all suddenly wide awake. The stars were all in quite different positions from those they had last noticed. The sky was very black except for the faintest possible greyness in the east. They were cold, though thirsty, and stiff. And none of them spoke because now at last something was happening.

Before them, beyond the pillars, there was the slope of a low hill. And now a door opened in the hillside, and light appeared in the doorway, and a figure came out, and the door shut behind it. The figure carried a light, and this light was really all that they could see distinctly. It came slowly nearer and nearer till at last it stood right at the table opposite to them. Now they could see that it was a tall girl, dressed in a single long garment of clear blue which left her arms bare. She was bareheaded and her yellow hair hung down her back. And when they looked at her they thought they had never before known what beauty meant.

The light which she had been carrying was a tall candle in a silver candlestick which she now set upon the table. If there had been any wind off the sea earlier in the night it must have died down by now, for the flame of the candle burned as straight and still as if it were in a room with the windows shut and the curtains drawn. Gold and silver on the table shone in its light.

Lucy now noticed something lying lengthwise on the table which had escaped her attention before. It was a knife of stone, sharp as steel, a cruel-looking, ancient-looking thing.

No one had yet spoken a word. Then—Reepicheep first, and Caspian next—they all rose to their feet, because they felt that she was a great lady.

“Travellers who have come from far to Aslan’s table,” said the girl.“Why do you not eat and drink?”

“Madam,” said Caspian, “we feared the food because we thought it had cast our friends into an enchanted sleep.

“They have never tasted it,” she said.

“Please,” said Lucy, “what happened to them?”

“Seven years ago,” said the girl, “they came here in a ship whose sails were rags and her timbers ready to fall apart. There were a few others with them, sailors, and when they came to this table one said, ‘Here is the good place. Let us set sail and reef sail and row no longer but sit down and end our days in peace!’ And the second said, ‘No, let us re-embark and sail for Narnia and the west; it may be that Miraz is dead.’ But the third, who was a very masterful man, leaped up and said, ‘No, by heaven. We are men and Telmarines, not brutes. What should we do but seek adventure after adventure? We have not long to live in any event. Let us spend what is left in seeking the unpeopled world behind the sunrise.’ And as they quarrelled he caught up the Knife of Stone which lies there on the table and would have fought with his comrades. But it is a thing not right for him to touch. And as his fingers closed upon the hilt, deep sleep fell upon all the three. And till the enchantment is undone they will never wake.”

“What is this Knife of Stone?” asked Eustace.

“Do none of you know it?” said the girl.

“I—I think,” said Lucy, “I’ve seen something like it before. It was a knife like it that the White Witch used when she killed Aslan at the Stone Table long ago.”

“It was the same.,” said the girl, “and it was brought here to be kept in honour while the world lasts.”

Edmund, who had been looking more and more uncomfortable for the last few minutes, now spoke.

“Look here,” he said, “I hope I’m not a coward—about eating this food, I mean—and I’m sure I don’t mean to be rude. But we have had a lot of queer adventures on this voyage of ours and things aren’t always what they seem. When I look in your face I can’t help believing all you say: but then that’s just what might happen with a witch too. How are we to know you’re a friend?”

“You can’t know,” said the girl. “You can only believe—or not.”

After a moment’s pause Reepicheep’s small voice was heard.

“Sire,” he said to Caspian, “of your courtesy fill my cup with wine from that flagon: it is too big for me to lift. I will drink to the lady.”

Caspian obeyed and the Mouse, standing on the table, held up a golden cup between its tiny paws and said, “Lady, I pledge you.” Then it fell to on cold peacock, and in a short while everyone else followed his example. All were very hungry and the meal, if not quite what you wanted for a very early breakfast, was excellent as a very late supper.

“Why is it called Aslan’s table?” asked Lucy presently.

“It is set here by his bidding,” said the girl, “for those who come so far. Some call this island the World’s End, for though you can sail further, this is the beginning of the end.”

“But how does the food keep?” asked the practical Eustace.

“It is eaten, and renewed every day,” said the girl. “This you will see.”

“And what are we to do about the Sleepers?” asked Caspian. “In the world from which my friends come”（here he nodded at Eustace and the Pevensies）“they have a story of a prince or a king coming to a castle where all the people lay in an enchanted sleep. In that story he could not dissolve the enchantment until he had kissed the Princess.”

“But here,” said the girl, “it is different. Here he cannot kiss the Princess till he has dissolved the enchantment.”

“Then,” said Caspian, “in the name of Aslan, show me how to set about that work at once.”

“My father will teach you that,” said the girl.

“Your father!” said everyone. “Who is he? And where?”

“Look,” said the girl, turning round and pointing at the door in the hillside. They could see it more easily now, for while they had been talking the stars had grown fainter and great gaps of white light were appearing in the greyness of the eastern sky.





CHAPTER FOURTEEN:

THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE WORLD


SLOWLY the door opened again and out there came a figure as tall and straight as the girl’s but not so slender. It carried no light but light seemed to come from it. As it came nearer, Lucy saw that it was like an old man. His silver beard came down to his bare feet in front and his silver hair hung down to his heels behind and his robe appeared to be made from the fleece of silver sheep. He looked so mild and grave that once more all the travellers rose to their feet and stood in silence.

But the old man came on without speaking to the travellers and stood on the other side of the table opposite to his daughter. Then both of them held up their arms before them and turned to face the east. In that position they began to sing. I wish I could write down the song, but on one who was present could remember it. Lucy said afterwards that it was high, almost shrill, but very beautiful, “A cold kind of song, an early morning kind of song.” And as they sang, the grey clouds lifted from the eastern sky and the white patches grew bigger and bigger till it was all white, and the sea began to shine like silver. And long afterwards（but those two sang all the time）the east began to turn red and at last, unclouded, the sun came up out of the sea and its long level ray shot down the length of the table on the gold and silver and on the Stone Knife.

Once or twice before, the Narnians had wondered whether the sun at its rising did not look bigger in these seas than it had looked at home. This time they we certain. There was no mistaking it. And the brightness of its ray on the dew and on the table was far beyond an. morning brightness they had ever seen. And as Edmund said afterwards, “Though lots of things happened on that trip which sound more exciting, that moment was really the most exciting.” For now they knew that they had truly come to the beginning of the End of the World.

Then something seemed to be flying at them out of the very centre of the rising sun: but of course one couldn’t look steadily in that direction to make sure. But presently the air became full of voices—voices which took up the same song that the Lady and her Father were singing, but in far wilder tones and in a language which no one knew And soon after that the owners of these voices could be seen. They were birds, large and white, and they came by hundreds and thousands and alighted on everything; on the grass, and the pavement, on the table, on your shoulders, your hands, and your head, till it looked as if heavy snow had fallen. For, like snow, they not only made everything white but blurred and blunted all shapes. But Lucy, looking out from between the wings of the birds that covered her, saw one bird fly to the Old Man with something in its beak that looked like a little fruit, unless it was a little live coal, which it might have been, for it was too bright to look at. And the bird laid it in the Old Man’s mouth.

Then the birds stopped their singing and appeared to be very busy about the table. When they rose from it again everything on the table that could be eaten or drunk had disappeared. These birds rose from their meal in their thousands and hundreds and carried away all the things that could not be eaten or drunk, such as bones, rinds, and shells, and took their flight back to the rising sun. But now, because they were not singing, the whir of their wings seemed to set the whole air a-tremble. And there was the table pecked clean and empty, and the three old Lords of Narnia still fast asleep.

Now at last the Old Man turned to the travellers and bade them welcome.

“Sir,” said Caspian, “will you tell us how to undo the enchantment which holds these three Narnian Lords asleep.”

“I will gladly tell you that, my son,” said the Old Man. “To break this enchantment you must sail to the World’s End, or as near as you can come to it, and you must come back having left at least one of your company behind.”

“And what must happen to that one?” asked Reepicheep.

“He must go on into the utter east and never return into the world.”“That is my heart’s desire,” said Reepicheep.

“And are we near the World’s End now, Sir?” asked Caspian. “Have you any knowledge of the seas and lands further east than this?”

“I saw them long ago,” said the Old Man, “but it was from a great height. I cannot tell you such things as sailors need to know.”

“Do you mean you were flying in the air?” Eustace blurted out.

“I was a long way above the air, my son,” replied the Old Man. “I am Ramandu. But I see that you stare at on another and have not heard this name. And no wonder, for the days when I was a star had ceased long before any of you knew this world, and all the constellations have changed.”

“Golly,” said Edmund under his breath. “He’s a retired star.”

“Aren’t you a star any longer?” asked Lucy.

“I am a star at rest, my daughter,” answered Ramandu. “When I set for the last time, decrepit and old beyond all that you can reckon, I was carried to this island. I am not so old now as I was then. Every morning a bird brings me a fire-berry from the valleys in the Sun, and each fire-berry takes away a little of my age. And when I have become as young as the child that was born yesterday, then I shall take my rising again（for we are at earth’s eastern rim）and once more tread the great dance.”

“In our world,” said Eustace, “a star is a huge ball of flaming gas.”

“Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is but only what it is made of. And in this world you have already met a star: for I think you have been with Coriakin.”

“Is he a retired star, too?” said Lucy.

“Well, not quite the same,” said Ramandu. “It was not quite as a rest that he was set to govern the Duffers. You might call it a punishment. He might have shone for thousands of years more in the southern winter sky if all had gone well.”

“What did he do, Sir?” asked Caspian.

“My son,” said Ramandu, “it is not for you, a son of Adam, to know what faults a star can commit. But come, we waste time in such talk. Are you yet resolved? Will you sail further east and come again, leaving one to return no more, and so break the enchantment? Or will you sail westward?”

“Surely, Sire,” said Reepicheep, “there is no question about that? It is very plainly part of our quest to rescue these three lords from enchantment.”

“I think the same, Reepicheep,” replied Caspian. “And even if it were not so, it would break my heart not to go as near the World’s End as the Dawn Treader will take us. But I am thinking of the crew. They signed on to seek the seven lords, not to reach the rim of the Earth. If we sail east from here we sail to find the edge, the utter east. And not one knows how far it is. They’re brave fellows, but I see signs that some of them are weary of the voyage and long to have our prow pointing to Narnia again. I don’t think I should take them further without their knowledge and consent. And then there’s the poor Lord Rhoop. He’s a broken man.”

“My son,” said the star, “it would be no use, even though you wished it, to sail for the World’s End with men unwilling or men deceived. That is not how great unenchantments are achieved. They must know where they go and why. But who is this broken man you speak of?”

Caspian told Ramandu the story of Rhoop.

“I can give him what he needs most,” said Ramandu. “I this island there is sleep without stint or measure, and sleep in which no faintest footfall of a dream was ever heard. Let him sit beside these other three and drink oblivion till your return.”

“Oh, do let’s do that, Caspian,” said Lucy. “I’m sure it’s just what he would love.”

At that moment they were interrupted by the sound of many feet and voices: Drinian and the rest of the ship company were approaching. They halted in surprise whey they saw Ramandu and his daughter; and then, because these were obviously great people, every man uncovered his head. Some sailors eyed the empty dishes and flagons on the table with eyes filled with regret.

“My lord,” said the King to Drinian, “pray send two men back to the Dawn Treader with a message to the Lord Rhoop. Tell him that the last of his old shipmates are here asleep—a sleep without dreams—and that he can share it.”

When this had been done, Caspian told the rest to sit down and laid the whole situation before them. When he had finished there was a long silence and some whispering until presently the Master Bowman got to his feet, and said:

“What some of us have been wanting to ask for a long time, your Majesty, is how we’re ever to get home when we do turn, whether we turn here or somewhere else. It’s been west and northwest winds all the way, barring an occasional calm. And if that doesn’t change, I’d like to know what hopes we have of seeing Narnia again. There’s not much chance of supplies lasting while we row all that way.”

“That’s landsman’s talk,” said Drinian. “There’s always a prevailing west wind in these seas all through the late summer, and it always changes after the New Year. We’ll have plenty of wind for sailing westward; more than we shall like from all accounts.”

“That’s true, Master,” said an old sailor who was a Galmian by birth. “You get some ugly weather rolling up from the east in January and February. And by your leave, Sire, if I was in command of this ship, I’d say to winter here and begin the voyage home in March.”

“What’d you eat while you were wintering here?” asked Eustace.

“This table,” said Ramandu, “will be filled with a king’s feast every day at sunset.”

“Now you’re talking!” said several sailors.

“Your Majesties and gentlemen and ladies all,” said Rynelf, “there’s just one thing I want to say. There’s not one of us chaps as was pressed on this journey. We’re volunteers. And there’s some here chat are looking very hard at that table and thinking about king’s feasts who were talking very loud about adventures on the day we sailed from Cair Paravel, and swearing they wouldn’t come home till we’d found the end of the world. And there were some standing on the quay who would have given all they had to come with us. It was thought a finer thing then to have a cabin boy’s berth on the Dawn Treader than to wear a knight’s belt. I don’t know if you get the hang of what I’m saying. But what I mean is that I think chaps who set out like us will look as silly as—as those Dufflepuds—if we come home and say we got to the beginning of the world’s end and hadn’t the heart to go further.”

Some of the sailors cheered at this but some said that that was all very well.

“This isn’t going to be much fun,” whispered Edmund to Caspian.“What are we to do if half those fellows hang back?”

“Wait,” Caspian whispered back. “I’ve still a card to play.”

“Aren’t you going to say anything, Reep?” whispered Lucy.

“No. Why should your Majesty expect it?” answered Reepicheep in a voice that most people heard. “My own plans are made. While I can, I sail east in the Dawn Treader. When she fails me, I paddle east in my coracle. When she sinks, I shall swim east with my four paws. And when I can swim no longer, if I have not reached Aslan’s country, or shot over the edge of the world in some vast cataract, I shall sink with my nose to the sunrise and Peepiceek will be head of the talking mice in Narnia.”

“Hear, hear,” said a sailor, “I’ll say the same, barring the bit about the coracle, which wouldn’t bear me.” He added in a lower voice, “I’m not going to be outdone by a mouse.”

At this point Caspian jumped to his feet. “Friends,” he said, “I think you have not quite understood our purpose. You talk as if we had come to you with our hat in our hand, begging for shipmates. It isn’t like that at all. We and our royal brother and sister and their kinsman and Sir Reepicheep, the good knight, and the Lord Drinian have an errand to the world’s edge. It is our pleasure to choose from among such of you as are willing those whom we deem worthy of so high an enterprise. We have not said that any can come for the asking. That is why we shall now command the Lord Drinian and Master Rhince to consider carefully what men among you are the hardest in battle, the most skilled seamen, the purest in blood, the most loyal to our person, and the cleanest of life and manners; and to give their names to us in a schedule.” He paused and went on in a quicker voice,“Aslan’s mane!” he exclaimed. “Do you think that the privilege of seeing the last things is to be bought for a song? Why, every man that comes with us shall bequeath the title of Dawn Treader to all his descendants, and when we land at Cair Paravel on the homeward voyage he shall have either gold or land enough to make him rich all his life. Now—scatter over the island, all of you. In half an hour’s time I shall receive the names that Lord Drinian brings me.”

There was rather a sheepish silence and then the crew made their bows and moved away, one in this direction and one in that, but mostly in little knots or bunches, talking.

“And now for the Lord Rhoop,” said Caspian.

But turning to the head of the table he saw that Rhoop was already there. He had arrived, silent and unnoticed, while the discussion was going on, and was seated beside the Lord Argoz. The daughter of Ramandu stood beside him as if she had just helped him into his chair; Ramandu stood behind him and laid both his hands on Rhoop’s grey head. Even in daylight a faint silver light came from the hands of the star. There was a smile on Rhoop’s haggard face. He held out one of his hands to Lucy and the other to Caspian. For a moment it looked as if he were going to say something. Then his smile brightened as if he were feeling some delicious sensation, a long sigh of contentment came from his lips, his head fell forward, and he slept.

“Poor Rhoop,” said Lucy. “I am glad. He must have had terrible times.”

“Don’t let’s even think of it,” said Eustace.

Meanwhile Caspian’s speech, helped perhaps by some magic of the island, was having just the effect he intended. A good many who had been anxious enough to get out of the voyage felt quite differently about being left out of it. And of course whenever any one sailor announced that he had made up his mind to ask for permission to sail, the ones who hadn’t said this felt that they were getting fewer and more uncomfortable. So that before the half-hour was nearly over several people were positively“sucking up” to Drinian and Rhince（at least that was what they called it at my school）to get a good report. And soon there were only three left who didn’t want to go, and those three were trying very hard to persuade others to stay with them. And very shortly after that there was only one left. And in they end he began to be afraid of being left behind all on his own and changed his mind.

At the end of the half-hour they all came trooping back to Aslan’s Table and stood at one end while Drinian and Rhince went and sat down with Caspian and made their report; and Caspian accepted all the men but that one who had changed his mind at the last moment. His name was Pittencream and he stayed on the Island of the Star all the time the others were away looking for the World’s End, and he very much wished he had gone with them. He wasn’t the sort of man who could enjoy talking to Ramandu and Ramandu’s daughter（nor they to him）, and it rained a good deal, and though there was a wonderful feast on the Table every night, he didn’t very much enjoy it. He said it gave him the creeps sitting there alone（and in the rain as likely as not）with those four Lords asleep at the end of the Table. And when the others returned he felt so out of things that he deserted on the voyage home at the Lone Islands, and went and lived in Calormen, where he told wonderful stories about his adventures at the End of the World, until at last he came to believe them himself. So you may say, in a sense, that he lived happily ever after. But he could never bear mice.

That night they all ate and drank together at the great Table between the pillars where the feast was magically renewed: and next morning the Dawn Treader set sail once more just when the great birds had come and gone again.

“Lady,” said Caspian, “I hope to speak with you again when I have broken the enchantments.” And Ramandu’s daughter looked at him and smiled.





CHAPTER FIFTEEN:

THE WONDERS OF THE LAST SEA


VERY soon after they had left Ramandu’s country they began to feel that they had already sailed beyond the world. All was different. For one thing they all found that they were needing less sleep. One did not want to go to bed nor to eat much, nor even to talk except in low voices. Another thing was the light. There was too much of it. The sun when it came up each morning looked twice, if not three times, its usual size. And every morning（which gave Lucy the strangest feeling of all）the huge white birds, singing their song with human voices in a language no one knew, streamed overhead and vanished astern on their way to their breakfast at Aslan’s Table. A little later they came flying back and vanished into the east.

“How beautifully clear the water is!” said Lucy to herself, as she leaned over the port side early in the afternoon of the second day.

And it was. The first thing that she noticed was a little black object, about the size of a shoe, travelling along at the same speed as the ship. For a moment she thought it was something floating on the surface. But then there came floating past a bit of stale bread which the cook had just thrown out of the galley. And the bit of bread looked as if it were going to collide with the black thing, but it didn’t. It passed above it, and Lucy now saw that the black thing could not be on the surface. Then the black thing suddenly got very much bigger and flicked back to normal size a moment later.

Now Lucy knew she had seen something just like that happen somewhere else—if only she could remember where. She held her hand to her head and screwed up her face and put out her tongue in the effort to remember. At last she did. Of course! It was like what you saw from a train on a bright sunny day. You saw the black shadow of your own coach running along the fields at the same pace as the train. Then you went into a cutting; and immediately the same shadow flicked close up to you and got big, racing along the grass of the cutting-bank. Then you came out of the cutting and—flick!—once more the black shadow had gone back to its normal size and was running along the fields.

“It’s our shadow!—the shadow of the Dawn Treader,” said Lucy.“Our shadow running along on the bottom of the sea. That time when it got bigger it went over a hill. But in that case the water must be clearer than I thought! Good gracious, I must he seeing the bottom of the sea; fathoms and fathoms down.”

As soon as she had said this she realized that the great silvery expanse which she had been seeing（without noticing）for some time was really the sand on the sea-bed and that all sorts of darker or brighter patches were not lights and shadows on the surface but real things on the bottom. At present, for instance, they were passing over a mass of soft purply green with a broad, winding strip of pale grey in the middle of it But now that she knew it was on the bottom she saw it much better. She could see that bits of the dark stuff were much higher than other bits and were waving gently. “Just like trees in a wind,” said Lucy. “And I do believe that’s what they are. It’s a submarine forest.”

They passed on above it and presently the pale streak was joined by another pale streak. “If I was down there,” thought Lucy, “that streak would be just like a road through the wood. And that place where it joins the other Would be a crossroads. Oh, I do wish I was. Hallo! the forest is coming to an end. And I do believe the streak really was a road! I can still see it going on across the open sand. It’s a different colour. And it’s marked out with something at the edges—dotted lines. Perhaps they are stones. And now it’s getting wider.”

But it was not really getting wider, it was getting nearer. She realized this because of the way in which the shadow of the ship came rushing up towards her. And the road—she felt sure it was a road now—began to go in zigzags. Obviously it was climbing up a steep hill. And when she held her head sideways and looked back, what she saw was very like what you see when you look down a winding road from the top of a hill. She could even see the shafts of sunlight falling through the deep water onto the wooded valley—and, in the extreme distance, everything melting away into a dim greenness. But some places—the sunny ones, she thought—were ultramarine blue.

She could not, however, spend much time looking back; what was coming into view in the forward direction was too exciting. The road had apparently now reached the top of the hill and ran straight forward. Little specks were moving to and fro on it. And now something most wonderful, fortunately in full sunlight—or as full as it can be when it falls through fathoms of water—flashed into sight. It was knobbly and jagged and of a pearly, or perhaps an ivory, colour. She was so nearly straight above it that at first she could hardly make out what it was. But everything became plain when she noticed its shadow. The sunlight was falling across Lucy’s shoulders, so the shadow of the thing lay stretched out on the sand behind it. And by its shape she saw clearly that it was a shadow of towers and pinnacles, minarets and domes.

“Why!—it’s a city or a huge castle,” said Lucy to herself “But I wonder why they’ve built it on top of a high mountain?”

Long afterwards when she was back in England and talked all these adventures over with Edmund, they thought of a reason and I am pretty sure it is the true one. In the sea, the deeper you go, the darker and colder it gets, and it is down there, in the dark and cold, that dangerous things live—the squid and the Sea Serpent and the Kraken. The valleys are the wild, unfriendly places. The sea-people feel about their valleys as we do about mountains, and feel about their mountains as we feel about valleys. It is on the heights（or, as we would say, “in the shallows”）that there is warmth and peace. The reckless hunters and brave knights of the sea go down into the depths on quests and adventures, but return home to the heights for rest and peace, courtesy and council, the sports, the dances and the songs.

They had passed the city and the sea-bed was still rising. It was only a few hundred feet below the ship now. The road had disappeared. They were sailing above an open park-like country, dotted with little groves of brightly-coloured vegetation. And then—Lucy nearly squealed aloud with excitement—she had seen People.

There were between fifteen and twenty of them, and all mounted on sea-horses—not the tiny little sea-horses which you may have seen in museums but horses rather bigger than themselves. They must be noble and lordly people, Lucy thought, for she could catch the gleam of gold on some of their foreheads and streamers of emerald or orange-coloured stuff fluttered from their shoulders in the current. Then:

“Oh, bother these fish!” said Lucy, for a whole shoal of small fat fish, swimming quite close to the surface, had come between her and the Sea People. But though this spoiled her view it led to the most interesting thing of all. Suddenly a fierce little fish of a kind she had never seen before came darting up from below, snapped, grabbed, and sank rapidly with one of the fat fish in its mouth. And all the Sea People were sitting on their horses staring up at what had happened. They seemed to be talking and laughing. And before the hunting fish had got back to them with its prey, another of the same kind came up from the Sea People. And Lucy was almost certain that one big Sea Man who sat on his sea-horse in the middle of the party had sent it or released it; as if he had been holding it back till then in his hand or on his wrist.

“Why, I do declare,” said Lucy, “it’s a hunting party. Or more like a hawking party. Yes, that’s it. They ride out with these little fierce fish on their wrists just as we used to ride out with falcons on our wrists when we were Kings and Queens at Cair Paravel long ago. And then they fly them—or I suppose I should say swim them—at the others. How—”

She stopped suddenly because the scene was changing. The Sea People had noticed the Dawn Treader. The shoal of fish hard scattered in every direction: the People themselves were coming up to find out the meaning of this big, black thing which had come between them and the sun. And now they were so close to the surface that if they had been in air, instead of water, Lucy could have spoken to them. There were men and women both. All wore coronets of some kind and many had chains of pearls. They wore no other clothes. Their bodies were the colour of old ivory, their hair dark purple. The King in the centre（no one could mistake him for anything but the King）looked proudly and fiercely into Lucy’s face and shook a spear in his hand. His knights did the same. The faces of the ladies were filled with astonishment. Lucy felt sure they had never seen a ship or a human before—and how should they, in seas beyond the world’s end where no ship ever came?

“What are you staring at, Lu?” said a voice close beside her.

Lucy had been so absorbed in what she was seeing that she started at the sound, and when she turned she found that her arm had gone “dead” from leaning so long on the rail in one position. Drinian and Edmund were beside her.

“Look,” she said.

They both looked, but almost at once Drinian said in a low voice:

“Turn round at once, your Majesties—that’s right, with our backs to the sea. And don’t look as if we were talking about anything important.”

“Why, what’s the matter?” said Lucy as she obeyed.

“It’ll never do for the sailors to see all that,” said Drinian. “We’ll have men falling in love with a sea-woman, or falling in love with the under-sea country itself, and jumping overboard. I’ve heard of that kind of thing happening before in strange seas. It’s always unlucky to see these people.”

“But we used to know them,” said Lucy. “In the old days at Cair Paravel when my brother Peter was High King. They came to the surface and sang at our coronation.”

“I think that must have been a different kind, Lu,” said Edmund.“They could live in the air as well as under water. I rather think these can’t. By the look of them they’d have surfaced and started attacking us long ago if they could. They seem very fierce.”

“At any rate,” began Drinian, but at that moment two sounds were heard. One was a plop. The other was a voice from the fighting-top shouting, “Man overboard!” Then everyone was busy. Some of the sailors hurried aloft to take in the sail: others hurried below to get to the oars; and Rhince, who was on duty on the poop, began to put the helm hard over so as to come round and back to the man who had gone overboard. But by now everyone knew that it wasn’t strictly a man. It was Reepicheep.

“Drat that mouse!” said Drinian. “It’s more trouble than all the rest of the ship’s company put together. If there is any scrape to be got into, in it will get! It ought to be put in irons—keel-hauled—marooned—have its whiskers cut off. Can anyone see the little blighter?”

All this didn’t mean that Drinian really disliked Reepicheep. On the contrary he liked him very much and was therefore frightened about him, and being frightened put him in a bad temper—just as your mother is much angrier with you for running out into the road in front of a car than a stranger would be. No one, of course, was afraid of Reepicheep’s drowning, for he was an excellent swimmer; but the three who knew what was going on below the water were afraid of those long, cruel spears in the hands of the Sea People.

In a few minutes the Dawn Treader had come round and everyone could see the black blob in the water which was Reepicheep. He was chattering with the greatest excitement but as his mouth kept on getting filled with water nobody could understand what he was saying.

“He’ll blurt the whole thing out if we don’t shut him up,” cried Drinian. To prevent this he rushed to the side and lowered a rope himself, shouting to the sailors, “All right, all right. Back to your places. I hope I can heave a mouse up without help.” And as Reepicheep began climbing up the rope—not very nimbly because his wet fur made him heavy—Drinian leaned over and whispered to him,

“Don’t tell. Not a word.”

But when the dripping Mouse had reached the deck it turned out not to be at all interested in the Sea People.

“Sweet!” he cheeped. “Sweet, sweet!”

“What are you talking about?” asked Drinian crossly. “And you needn’t shake yourself all over me, either.”

“I tell you the water’s sweet,” said the Mouse. “Sweet, fresh. It isn’t salt.”

For a moment no one quite took in the importance of this. But then Reepicheep once more repeated the old prophecy:

“Where the waves grow sweet,

Doubt not, Reepicheep,

There is the utter East.”

Then at last everyone understood.

“Let me have a bucket, Rynelf,” said Drinian.

It was handed him and he lowered it and up it came again. The water shone in it like glass.

“Perhaps your Majesty would like to taste it first,” said Drinian to Caspian.

The King took the bucket in both hands, raised it to his lips, sipped, then drank deeply and raised his head. His face was changed. Not only his eyes but everything about him seemed to be brighter.

“Yes,” he said, “it is sweet. That’s real water, that. I’m not sure that it isn’t going to kill me. But it is the death I would have chosen—if I’d known about it till now.”

“What do you mean?” asked Edmund.

“It—it’s like light more than anything else,” said Caspian.

“That is what it is,” said Reepicheep. “Drinkable light. We must be very near the end of the world now.”

There was a moment’s silence and then Lucy knelt down on the deck and drank from the bucket.

“It’s the loveliest thing I have ever tasted,” she said with a kind of gasp. “But oh—it’s strong. We shan’t need to eatanything now.”

And one by one everybody on board drank. And for a long time they were all silent. They felt almost too well and strong to bear it; and presently they began to notice another result. As I have said before, there had been too much light ever since they left the island of Ramandu—the sun too large（though not too hot）, the sea too bright, the air too shining. Now, the light grew no less—if anything, it increased—but they could bear it. They could look straight up at the sun without blinking. They could see more light than they had ever seen before. And the deck and the sail and their own faces and bodies became brighter and brighter and every rope shone. And next morning, when the sun rose, now five or six times its old size, they stared hard into it and could see the very feathers of the birds that came flying from it.

Hardly a word was spoken on board all that day, till about dinner time（no one wanted any dinner, the water was enough for them）Drinian said:

“I can’t understand this. There is not a breath of wind. The sail hangs dead. The sea is as flat as a pond. And yet we drive on as fast as if there were a gale behind us.”

“I’ve been thinking that, too,” said Caspian. “We must be caught in some strong current.”

“H’m,” said Edmund. “That’s not so nice if the World really has an edge and we’re getting near it.”

“You mean,” said Caspian, “that we might be just—well poured over it?”

“Yes, yes,” cried Reepicheep, clapping his paws together. “That’s how I’ve always imagined it—the World like a great round table and the waters of all the oceans endlessly pouring over the edge. The ship will tip up—stand on her head—for one moment we shall see over the edge—and then, down, down, the rush, the speed—”

“And what do you think will be waiting for us at the bottom, eh?” said Drinian.

“Aslan’s country perhaps,” said the Mouse, its eyes shining. “Or perhaps there isn’t any bottom. Perhaps it goes down for ever and ever. But whatever it is, won’t it be worth anything just to have looked for one moment beyond the edge of the world.”

“But look here,” said Eustace, “this is all rot. The world’s round—I mean, round like a ball, not like a table.”

“Our world is,” said Edmund. “But is this?”

“Do you mean to say,” asked Caspian, “that you three come from a round world（round like a ball）and you’ve never told me! It’s really too bad of you. Because we have fairy-tales in which there are round worlds and I always loved them. I never believed there were any real ones. But I’ve always wished there were and I’ve always longed to live in one. Oh, I’d give anything—I wonder why you can get into our world and we never get into yours? If only I had the chance! It must be exciting to live on a thing like a ball. Have you ever been to the parts where people walk about upside-down?”

Edmund shook his head. “And it isn’t like that,” he added. “There’s nothing particularly exciting about a round world when you’re there.





CHAPTER SIXTEEN:

THE VERY END OF THE WORLD


REEPICHEEP was the only person on board besides Drinian and the two Pevensies who had noticed the Sea People. He had dived in at once when he saw the Sea King shaking his spear, for he regarded this as a sort of threat or challenge and wanted to have the matter out there and then. The excitement of discovering that the water was now fresh had distracted his attention, and before he remembered the Sea People again Lucy and Drinian had taken him aside and warned him not to mention what he had seen.

As things turned out they need hardly have bothered, for by this time the Dawn Treader was gliding over a part of the sea which seemed to be uninhabited. No one except Lucy saw anything more of the People, and even she had only one short glimpse. All morning on the following day they sailed in fairly shallow water and the bottom was weedy. Just before midday Lucy saw a large shoal of fishes grazing on the weed. They were all eating steadily and all moving in the same direction. “Just like a flock of sheep,” thought Lucy. Suddenly she saw a little Sea Girl of about her own age in the middle of them—a quiet, lonely-looking girl with a sort of crook in her hand. Lucy felt sure that this girl must be a shepherdess—or perhaps a fish-herdess—and that the shoal was really a flock at pasture.Both the fishes and the girl were quite close to the surface. And just as the girl, gliding in the shallow water, and Lucy, leaning over the bulwark, came opposite to one another, the girl looked up and stared straight into Lucy’s face. Neither could speak to the other and in a moment the Sea Girl dropped astern. But Lucy will never forget her face. It did not look frightened or angry like those of the other Sea People. Lucy had liked that girl and she felt certain the girl had liked her. In that one moment they had somehow become friends. There does not seem to be much chance of their meeting again in that world or any other. But if ever they do they will rush together with their hands held out.

After that for many days, without wind in her shrouds or foam at her bows, across a waveless sea, the Dawn Treader glided smoothly east. Every day and every hour the light became more brilliant and still they could bear it. No one ate or slept and no one wanted to, but they drew buckets of dazzling water from the sea, stronger than wine and somehow wetter, more liquid, than ordinary water, and pledged one another silently in deep draughts of it. And one or two of the sailors who had been oldish men when the voyage began now grew younger every day. Everyone on board was filled with joy and excitement, but not an excitement that made one talk. The further they sailed the less they spoke, and then almost in a whisper. The stillness of that last sea laid hold on them.

“My Lord,” said Caspian to Drinian one day, “what do you see ahead?”

“Sire,” said Drinian, “I see whiteness. All along the horizon from north to south, as far as my eyes can reach.”

“That is what I see too,” said Caspian, “and I cannot imagine what it is.”

“If we were in higher latitudes, your Majesty,” said Drinian, “I would say it was ice. But it can’t be that; not here. All the same, we’d better get men to the oars and hold the ship back against the current. Whatever the stuff is, we don’t want to crash into it at this speed!”

They did as Drinian said, and so continued to go slower and slower. The whiteness did not get any less mysterious as they approached it. If it was land it must be a very strange land, for it seemed just as smooth as the water and on the same level with it. When they got very close to it Drinian put the helm hard over and turned the Dawn Treader south so that she was broadside on to the current and rowed a little way southward along the edge of the whiteness. In so doing they accidentally made the important discovery that the current was only about forty feet wide and the rest of the sea as still as a pond. This was good news for the crew, who had already begun to think that the return journey to Ramandu’s land, rowing against stream all the way, would be pretty poor sport.（It also explained why the shepherd girl had dropped so quickly astern. She was not in the current. If she had been she would have been moving east at the same speed as the ship.）

And still no one could make out what the white stuff was. Then the boat was lowered and it put off to investigate. Those who remained on the Dawn Treader could see that the boat pushed right in amidst the whiteness. Then they could hear the voices of the party in the boat（clear across the still water）talking in a shrill and surprised way. Then there was a pause while Rynelf in the bows of the boat took a sounding; and when, after that, the boat came rowing back there seemed to be plenty of the white stuff inside her. Everyone crowded to the side to hear the news.

“Lilies, your Majesty!” shouted Rynelf, standing up in the bows.

“What did you say?” asked Caspian.

“Blooming lilies, your Majesty,” said Rynelf. “Same as in a pool or in a garden at home.”

“Look!” said Lucy, who was in the stern of the boat. She held up her wet arms full of white petals and broad flat leaves.

“What’s the depth, Rynelf?” asked Drinian.

“That’s the funny thing, Captain,” said Rynelf. “It’s still deep. Three and a half fathoms clear.”

“They can’t be real lilies—not what we call lilies,” said Eustace.

Probably they were not, but they were very like them. And when, after some consultation, the Dawn Treader turned back into the current and began to glide eastward through the Lily Lake or the Silver Sea（they tried both these names but it was the Silver Sea that stuck and is now on Caspian’s map）the strangest part of their travels began. Very soon the open sea which they were leaving was only a thin rim of blue on the western horizon. Whiteness, shot with faintest colour of gold, spread round them on every side, except just astern where their passage had thrust the lilies apart and left an open lane of water that shone like dark green glass. To look at, this last sea was very like the Arctic; and if their eyes had not by now grown as strong as eagles’ the sun on all that whiteness—especially at early morning when the sun was hugest—would have been unbearable. And every evening the same whiteness made the daylight last longer. There seemed no end to the lilies. Day after day from all those miles and leagues of flowers there rose a smell which Lucy found it very hard to describe; sweet—yes, but not at all sleepy or overpowering, a fresh, wild, lonely smell that seemed to get into your brain and make you feel that you could go up mountains at a run or wrestle with an elephant. She and Caspian said to one another, “I feel that I can’t stand much more of this, yet I don’t want it to stop.”

They took soundings very often but it was only several days later that the water became shallower. After that it went on getting shallower. There came a day when they had to row out of the current and feel their way forward at a snail’s pace, rowing. And soon it was clear that the Dawn Treader could sail no further east. Indeed it was only by very clever handling that they saved her from grounding.

“Lower the boat,” cried Caspian, “and then call the men aft. I must speak to them.”

“What’s he going to do?” whispered Eustace to Edmund. “There’s a queer look in his eyes.”

“I think we probably all look the same,” said Edmund.

They joined Caspian on the poop and soon all the men were crowded together at the foot of the ladder to hear the King’s speech.

“Friends,” said Caspian, “we have now fulfilled the quest on which you embarked. The seven lords are all accounted for and as Sir Reepicheep has sworn never to return, when you reach Ramandu’s Land you will doubtless find the Lords Revilian and Argoz and Mavramorn awake. To you, my Lord Drinian, I entrust this ship, bidding you sail to Narnia with all the speed you may, and above all not to land on the Island of Deathwater. And instruct my regent, the Dwarf Trumpkin, to give to all these, my shipmates, the rewards I promised them. They have been earned well. And if I come not again it is my will that the Regent, and Master Cornelius, and Trufflehunter the Badger, and the Lord Drinian choose a King of Narnia with the consent—”

“But, Sire,” interrupted Drinian, “are you abdicating?”

“I am going with Reepicheep to see the World’s End,” said Caspian.

A low murmur of dismay ran through the sailors.

“We will take the boat,” said Caspian. “You will have no need of it in these gentle seas and you must build a new one on Ramandu’s island. And now—”

“Caspian,” said Edmund suddenly and sternly, “you can’t do this.”

“Most certainly,” said Reepicheep, “his Majesty cannot.”

“No indeed,” said Drinian.

“Can’t?” said Caspian sharply, looking for a moment not unlike his uncle Miraz.

“Begging your Majesty’s pardon,” said Rynelf from the deck below,“but if one of us did the same it would be called deserting.”

“You presume too much on your long service, Rynelf,” said Caspian.

“No, Sire! He’s perfectly right,” said Drinian.

“By the Mane of Aslan,” said Caspian, “I had thought you were all my subjects here, not my schoolmasters.”

“I’m not,” said Edmund, “and I say you can not do this.”

“Can’t again,” said Caspian. “What do you mean?”

“If it please your Majesty, we mean shall not,” said Reepicheep with a very low bow. “You are the King of Narnia. You break faith with all your subjects, and especially with Trumpkin, if you do not return. You shall not please yourself with adventures as if you were a private person. And if your Majesty will not hear reason it will be the truest loyalty of every man on board to follow me in disarming and binding you till you come to your senses.”

“Quite right,” said Edmund. “Like they did with Ulysses when he wanted to go near the Sirens.”

Caspian’s hand had gone to his sword hilt, when Lucy said, “And you’ve almost promised Ramandu’s daughter to go back.”

Caspian paused. “Well, yes. There is that,” he said. He stood irresolute for a moment and then shouted out to the ship in general.

“Well, have your way. The quest is ended. We all return. Get the boat up again.”

“Sire,” said Reepicheep, “we do not all return. I, as I explained before—”

“Silence!” thundered Caspian. “I’ve been lessoned but I’ll not be baited. Will no one silence that Mouse?”

“Your Majesty promised,” said Reepicheep, “to be good lord to the Talking Beasts of Narnia.”

“Talking beasts, yes,” said Caspian. “I said nothing about beasts that never stop talking.” And he flung down the ladder in a temper and went into the cabin, slamming the door.

But when the others rejoined him a little later they found him changed; he was white and there were tears in his eyes.

“It’s no good,” he said. “I might as well have behaved decently for all the good I did with my temper and swagger. Aslan has spoken to me. No—I don’t mean he was actually here. He wouldn’t fit into the cabin, for one thing. But that gold lion’s head on the wall came to life and spoke to me. It was terrible his eyes. Not that he was at all rough with me—only a bit stern at first. But it was terrible all the same. And he said—he said—oh, I can’t bear it. The worst thing he could have said. You’re to go on—Reep and Edmund, and Lucy, and Eustace; and I’m to go back. Alone. And at once. And what is the good of anything?”

“Caspian, dear,” said Lucy. “You knew we’d have to go back to our own world sooner or later.”

“Yes,” said Caspian with a sob, “but this is sooner.”

“You’ll feel better when you get back to Ramandu’s Island,” said Lucy.

He cheered up a little later on, but it was a grievous parting on both sides and I will not dwell on it. About two o’clock in the afternoon, well victualled and watered（though they thought they would need neither food nor drink）and with Reepicheep’s coracle on board, the boat pulled away from the Dawn Treader to row through the endless carpet of lilies. The Dawn Trader flew all her flags and hung out her shields to honour their departure. Tall and big and homelike she looked from their low position with the lilies all round them. And even before she was out of sight they saw her turn and begin rowing slowly westward. Yet though Lucy shed a few tears, she could not feel it as much as you might have expected. The light, the silence, the tingling smell of the Silver Sea, even（in some odd way）the loneliness itself, were too exciting.

There was no need to row, for the current drifted them steadily to the east. None of them slept or ate. All that night and all next day they glided eastward, and when the third day dawned—with a brightness you or I could not bear even if we had dark glasses on—they saw a wonder ahead. It was as if a wall stood up between them and the sky, a greenish grey, trembling, shimmering wall. Then up came the sun, and at its first rising they saw it through the wall and it turned into wonderful rainbow colours. Then they knew that the wall was really a long, tall wave—a wave endlessly fixed in one place as you may often see at the edge of a waterfall. It seemed to be about thirty feet high, and the current was gliding them swiftly towards it. You might have supposed they would have thought of their danger. They didn’t. I don’t think anyone could have in their position. For now they saw something not only behind the wave but behind the sun. They could not have seen even the sun if their eyes had not been strengthened by the water of the Last Sea. But now they could look at the rising sun and see it clearly and see things beyond it. What they saw—eastward, beyond the sun—was a range of mountains. It was so high that either they never saw the top of it or they forgot it. None of them remembers seeing any sky in that direction. And the mountains must really have been outside the world. For any mountains even a quarter of a twentieth of that height ought to have had ice and snow on them. But these were warm and green and full, of forests and waterfalls however high you looked. And suddenly there came a breeze from the east, tossing the top of the wave into foamy shapes and ruffling the smooth water all round them. It lasted only a second or so but what it brought them in that second none of those three children will ever forget. It brought both a smell and a sound, a musical sound Edmund and Eustace would never talk about it afterwards. Lucy could only say, “It would break your heart.”“Why,” said I, “was it so sad?”“Sad!! No,” said Lucy.

No one in that boat doubted chat they were seeing beyond the End of the World into Aslan’s country.

At that moment, with a crunch, the boat ran aground. The water was too shallow now for it. “This,” said Reepicheep, “is where I go on alone.”

They did not even try to stop dim, for everything now felt as if it had been fated or had happened before. They helped him to lower his little coracle. Then he took off his sword（“I shall need it no more,” he said）and flung it far away across the lilied sea. Where it fell it stood upright with the hilt above the surface. Then he bade them good-bye trying to be sad for their sakes; but he was quivering with happiness. Lucy, for the first and last time, did what she had always wanted to do, taking him in her arms and caressing him. Then hastily he got into his coracle and took his paddle, and the current caught it and away he went, very black against the lilies. But no lilies grew on the wave; it was a smooth green slope. The coracle went more and more quickly, and beautifully it rushed up the wave’s side. For one split second they saw its shape and Reepicheep’s on the very top. Then it vanished, and since that moment no one can truly claim to have seen Reepicheep the Mouse. But my belief is that he came safe to Aslan’s country and is alive there to this day.

As the sun rose the sight of those mountains outside the world faded away. The wave remained but there was only blue sky behind it.

The children got out of the boat and waded—not towards the wave but southward with the wall of water on their left. They could not have told you why they did this; it was their fate. And though they had felt—and been—very grown-up on the Dawn Treader, they now felt just the opposite and held hands as they waded through the lilies. They never felt tired. The water was warm and all the time it got shallower. At last they were on dry sand, and then on grass—a huge plain of very fine short grass, almost level with the Silver Sea and spreading in every direction without so much as a molehill.

And of course, as it always does in a perfectly flat place without trees, it looked as if the sky came down to meet the grass in front of them. But as they went on they got the strangest impression that here at last the sky did really come down and join the earth—a blue wall, very bright, but real and solid: more like glass than anything else. And soon they were quite sure of it. It was very near now.

But between them and the foot of the sky there was something so white on the green grass that even with their eagles’ eyes they could hardly look at it. They came on and saw that it was a Lamb.

“Come and have breakfast,” said the Lamb in its sweet milky voice.

Then they noticed for the first time that there was a fire lit on the grass and fish roasting on it. They sat down and ate the fish, hungry now for the first time for many days. And it was the most delicious food they had ever tasted.

“Please, Lamb,” said Lucy, “is this the way to Aslan’s country?”

“Not for you,” said the Lamb. “For you the door into Aslan’s country is from your own world.”

“What!” said Edmund. “Is there a way into Aslan’s country from our world too?”

“There is a way into my country from all the worlds,” said the Lamb; but as he spoke his snowy white flushed into tawny gold and his size changed and he was Aslan himself, towering above them and scattering light from his mane.

“Oh, Aslan,” said Lucy. “Will you tell us how to get into your country from our world?”

“I shall be telling you all the time,” said Aslan. “But I will not tell you how long or short the way will be; only that it lies across a river. But do not fear that, for I am the great Bridge Builder. And now come; I will open the door in the sky and send you to your own land.”

“Please, Aslan,” said Lucy. “Before we go, will you tell us when we can come back to Narnia again? Please. And oh, do, do, do make it soon.”

“Dearest,” said Aslan very gently, “you and your brother will never come balk to Narnia.”

“Oh, Aslan!!” said Edmund and Lucy both together in despairing voices.

“You are too old, children,” said Aslan, “and you must begin to come close to your own world now.”

“It isn’t Narnia, you know,” sobbed Lucy. “It’s you. We shan’t meet you there. And how can we live, never meeting you?”

“But you shall meet me, dear one,” said Aslan.

“Are—are you there too, Sir?” said Edmund.

“I am,” said Aslan. “But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there.”

“And is Eustace never to come back here either?” said Lucy.

“Child,” said Aslan, “do you really need to know that? Come, I am opening the door in the sky.” Then all in one moment there was a rending of the blue wall（like a curtain being torn）and a terrible white light from beyond the sky, and the feel of Aslan’s mane and a Lion’s kiss on their foreheads and then—the bark bedroom in Aunt Alberta’s home at Cambridge.





Only two more things need to be told. One is that Caspian and his men all came safely back to Ramandu’s Island. And the three lords woke from their sleep. Caspian married Ramandu’s daughter and they all reached Narnia in the end, and she became a great queen and the mother and grandmother of great kings. The other is that back in our own world everyone soon started saying how Eustace had improved, and how “You’d never know him for the same boy”: everyone except Aunt Alberta, who said he had become very commonplace and tiresome and it must have been the influence of those Pevensie children.
