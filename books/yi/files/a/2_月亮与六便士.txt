第一章


毋庸讳言，当我初次结识查尔斯·斯特里克兰时，并未看出他有何过人之处。然而，现在大多数人都认识到了他的伟大。我所说的伟大，并非官运亨通的政客或者立功受奖的军人所赢得的那种伟大，因为这些人的伟大只关乎于他们的地位，而无涉于个人的品性。一旦时过境迁，他们身上的光环也就褪去了。人们通常会发现一位卸职的首相想当年无非是个夸夸其谈的政客，没有一兵一卒的光杆司令现在也只不过是市肆中气短的英雄。但是查尔斯·斯特里克兰的伟大却是货真价实的，可能你不喜欢他的艺术，但不管怎样你无法拒绝由它所唤起的兴趣。他的作品能吸引你的目光，触动你的心弦。他受人讥讽的时代已经过去了，而且对他的辩护不再被看作是古怪的行径，对他的赞颂也不再被认为是反常的表现。瑕不掩瑜，甚至他的缺点在人们的眼中也变得理所应当。他在艺术领域的地位尚无定论，或许崇拜者的恭维和贬损者的蔑视都很任性随意，但有一点却毋庸置疑，那就是他秉具的天赋。在我看来，对于艺术，最有趣的东西就是艺术家的个性。如果个性非凡，即使这个艺术家有再多的缺点，我也愿意原谅。我认为委拉斯开兹[1]是个比艾尔·格列柯[2]更优秀的画家，可是他的画风和题材司空见惯，缺乏新鲜感，不免让人们对他的崇拜大打折扣。而那位来自克里特岛[3]的画家格列柯，他的作品充满肉欲和悲剧的情调，仿佛作为永恒的牺牲把自己灵魂的神秘奉献出来。艺术家们，无论是画家、诗人或是音乐家，会用他们或者崇高、或者美妙的作品来装点世界，满足人们审美的需要，但这又类同于人的性本能，美妙的同时又不无野蛮粗暴。伟大的艺术家会将作品与其个人本身的伟大才能一同展现出来，寻找艺术家的秘密有种阅读侦探小说般让人欲罢不能的感觉，又如同宇宙充满了奥秘，迷人之处在于无法找到答案。即便是斯特里克兰最不起眼的作品也在暗示着他那怪异、复杂、受折磨的个性。毫无疑问，正是这些特点使得那些不喜欢他的作品的人也无法对这些画作漠然视之。同样也正是因为这一点，才会有那么多人对他的生活和性格感到兴奋和好奇，激发了他们浓厚的兴趣。

直到斯特里克兰去世四年后，莫里斯·休瑞写了一篇文章，发表在《法兰西信使》上，正是这篇文章才使得这位默默无闻的画家不致湮没，而且为后来的那些囿于传统的评论家们开辟了一条新的道路。在法国，长期以来没有哪位评论家像休瑞那样具有无可争辩的权威性，他的观点绝对让人印象深刻。他对斯特里克兰的赞誉似乎有些过头，但后来人们对这位画家的评价证明他的话所言非虚。今天斯特里克兰的名声正是建立在他当初的判断之上，这位画家的声名鹊起可以说是艺术史上最具浪漫色彩的事件之一。某些画家傲慢地宣称外行们根本不懂绘画艺术，所以俗人要表达对画作欣赏的最好方式就是闭嘴和掏出支票，我对这种说法不能认同，因为艺术是感情的表达，而感情是人类共通和能够理解的。所以，艺术只有艺术家才能鉴赏的说法，就如同精妙的手艺只有能工巧匠才能完全理解一样荒诞不经。但是我也承认，对绘画技巧缺乏实际知识的评论家很少能对画作提出真正有价值的看法，而我自己对绘画就一无所知。幸运的是，在这方面我不必冒妄加评论的风险，因为我的朋友爱德华·勒加特先生，既是一位有能力的作家，又是一位造诣颇深的画家，在他的一本小书[4]中，对斯特里克兰的作品做了充分的探讨，此书的文风优美，堪称典范，令人难过的是，这种文风在英国的大部分地区远不如在法国那样受到推崇。

莫里斯·休瑞在他那篇著名的文章中对查尔斯·斯特里克兰的生平做了简介，旨在吊足读者好奇的胃口。在对艺术表现出的冷峻的感情之下，他却表达出了真诚的渴望，呼唤人们对一个极具原创精神的天才要给予明智的关注。但是，休瑞是个撰稿的高手，他不会不知道“好奇之心，人皆有之”的道理，他用这种方式轻易地达到了预期的效果。当那些过去与斯特里克兰有过接触的人——有些作家在伦敦时就认识他，有些画家在蒙特马特尔咖啡馆和他见过面——惊讶地发现，原来他们以为他不过是个失败的画家，现在却好像换了个人似的，成了一个真正的天才，并与他们失之交臂。他的名字开始出现在法国和美国杂志刊登的一系列文章中，某个人会撰写对他的回忆文章，另一个人会撰写对他画作的鉴赏文章，这些文章增加了斯特里克兰的名声，但却勾起了公众的好奇心，而又无法完全满足他们的好奇。有关斯特里克兰的文章很受读者欢迎，勤奋的维特布瑞希特—洛特霍尔兹在他鸿篇巨制的专著[5]里开列了一张书单，列举出富有权威性的一些文章。

编造神话的能力是人类所固有的，在那些出类拔萃的人的生涯中，无论发生的是令人惊讶的事件还是神秘的事件，都会被人们津津乐道，人们还热衷发明一种传奇，并且狂热地笃信不移。它是用一种浪漫对平庸生活进行的抗议。传奇中的种种事件已然成为英雄走向不朽最可靠的通行证。沃尔特·雷利爵士[6]在人们的记忆中被奉为神圣，与其说是因为他发现了很多领地，并以英国的名字命名的丰功伟绩，还不如说是因为他把披风铺在地上让伊丽莎白女王踏过去的小插曲。一个惯于冷嘲热讽的哲学家想到这点时，会哑然失笑。查尔斯·斯特里克兰生前默默无闻，一生树敌颇多而交友甚少，那些为他著书立说的人要用活跃的想象去弥补所收集资料的不足也就毫不为奇了。但显而易见的是，尽管人们对斯特里克兰生平事迹知道得并不多，但足够浪漫的文人骚客从中可以找到大量铺陈敷衍的材料，他的生活中有不少离奇可怕的事件，他的性格里也有反常粗暴的一面，他的命运中又不乏悲壮凄怆的遭遇。经过一段时间，便从这材料中产生了一个传奇，即使是睿智的历史学家对这种传奇也不敢贸然抨击。

然而，一个明智的历史学家本应该讲求准确，但罗伯特·斯特里克兰牧师显然不属此类。他宣称写他父亲的传记[7]是为了“消除某些街谈巷议的误解”，尤其是关于他父亲后半生的谬种流传，已经“给活着的亲人带来很大痛苦”。显而易见，众所周知的对斯特里克兰生平的种种描述，都让一个体面的家庭蒙羞。我是带着一种消遣娱乐的心情来读这本传记的，而且暗自庆幸，这本书写得毫无生气，枯燥乏味。斯特里克兰先生在书中被刻画成一个模范丈夫和好父亲，一个脾气随和、做事勤勉、品行端正的谦谦君子。这位当代的牧师在做《圣经》诠释学[8]的研究时，已经获得了某种令人吃惊的、顾左右而言他的能力，其精妙之处在于，作为一个尽职的儿子，罗伯特·斯特里克兰牧师在“诠释”乃父生前种种事迹时，总能很方便地找到某些细节，使他能够在时机成熟时在教会获得显要职位，甚至我都似乎看到了他肌肉结实的小腿上俨然已经套上了主教的绑腿。虽然这事做起来需要巨大的勇气，也会冒一定的风险，因为在斯特里克兰声誉日隆时，那些普遍被人接受的传说，并没有对他的名声带来好的影响。他的艺术对很多人有那么大的吸引力，或者是因为人们对他的性格很憎恶，或者是对他的死充满同情。斯特里克兰儿子的这部为父亲粉饰的传记，不啻给其父的崇拜者们浇了一头冷水。在这部传记出版后，人们还在对此书议论纷纷之际，斯特里克兰一生中最重要的作品之一——《撒玛利亚的女人》[9]旋即被卖给了克里斯蒂[10]拍卖行，可最后拍出的价钱比九个月前少了235英镑就并非偶然了。那时，一位有名的收藏家购得了这幅画，但他突然离世，所以这幅画又重新被拍卖。如果人类非凡的造就神话史诗的能力无法消除某种影响，即一个故事不能满足人类的猎奇心的话，光凭查尔斯·斯特里克兰的力量和独创性，是远远不能使得其画作的价钱前后差别有如此之大的。幸亏没过多久，维特布瑞希特—洛特霍尔兹博士的作品就问世了，最终让所有的艺术爱好者们打消了顾虑。

维特布瑞希特—洛特霍尔兹博士属于这样一类历史学家的学派：认为人性要多坏就有多坏，可以说没有最坏只有更坏。当然，比起那些成心把传奇性的大人物写成道貌岸然的君子，使人败兴的作家来说，这一派历史学家的著作肯定能给读者带来更大的乐趣。对我而言，如果把安东尼和克里奥佩特拉[11]之间仅仅写成经济上的联盟，我会感到遗憾的。同样要让我相信提比略[12]和英王乔治五世一样是无可指摘的君主的话，恐怕要拿出比现存材料更多的证据来证明，谢天谢地，目前似乎还没有。维特布瑞希特—洛特霍尔兹博士正是用了这样的逻辑来评论罗伯特·斯特里克兰牧师所写的传记，这部天真的传记让人们对于那位不幸的人儿难免会产生某种同情。牧师为顾及体面故意闪烁其词的地方，被攻击为虚伪；大肆渲染的地方，被严责为谎言；而保持沉默的地方又被诟病为背叛。对于传记作者来说，作品中的这些小过失应该受到指责，但是对于传记主人公的儿子而言，又情有可原。倒霉的是，盎格鲁—撒克逊民族似乎也因此受到牵连，被非难为假装正经、弄虚作假、狂妄自大、欺骗成性、狡猾成精，甚至烹饪也一塌糊涂。我个人认为，斯特里克兰牧师在驳斥已深入人心的，说他父母之间“不太愉快”的论调时，实在过于草率。他在传记中引用一封查尔斯·斯特里克兰从巴黎寄来的信件，把他的妻子描述为“一个优秀的女人”，而维特布瑞希特—洛特霍尔兹博士把这封信的原件复制了出来，原来段落中这句话的原意是这样的：“让上帝诅咒我的妻子吧，她可真是一个‘优秀得可以’的女人，我真希望她能下地狱。”牧师对于不受欢迎的证据这样来处理，即使在教会鼎盛的时代，似乎也大为不妥。

维特布瑞希特—洛特霍尔兹博士是查尔斯·斯特里克兰热情的崇拜者，他如果要想为斯特里克兰进行粉饰不会有丝毫危险。但是，他目光敏锐，对于所有隐藏在天真无邪表象下卑劣的动机都能明察秋毫。他既是一个精神病理学家，又是艺术的研究者，没有什么潜意识下的秘密能够瞒得了他，没有哪个探究秘密的人能够像他那样在平凡物体中看出更深的意义。这个探秘的人看出了不便言传的东西，而精神病理学家看到了无法说出的东西。我们看到这位博学的作家热衷于搜寻出每一件让这位主人公丢脸的逸闻逸事，不免让人啧啧称奇。每当他找出某件主人公冷酷无情或卑鄙自私的例子，他的心就会对他多一份热情，而且在找到某件被遗忘的故事，能够用来嘲弄罗伯特·斯特里克兰牧师的一片孝心时，他就会像宗教法庭[13]的法官审判异教徒那样兴高采烈。他那孜孜不倦的精神着实令人赞叹，没有什么琐事能够在他的笔下漏掉，如果查尔斯·斯特里克兰有一笔洗衣费用没有付清，细节就会被详细地[14]记录下来；如果他欠别人半克朗的钱没有偿还，这笔债务的每一个细节绝不会被漏掉。





第二章


关于查尔斯·斯特里克兰的著述已经够多的了，似乎不用我再增加笔墨加以赘述。况且，能够树立起一个画家丰碑的应该是他的作品。但是，事实上我比大多数人都更熟悉和了解他，我初次遇见他是在他成为画家之前。他在巴黎的那段困难岁月里，我经常和他见面，但如果不是为了躲避战争的烽火而来到塔希提岛的话，我也没有想到会把对他的回忆诉诸笔端。众所周知，在塔希提岛他度过了他生命中的最后几年，在岛上我碰巧也遇到了一些很熟悉他的人，于是我发现自己正是那个可以阐明他悲剧人生中最为湮没阶段的人。如果坚信斯特里克兰的伟大是对的，那么作为一个亲身接触过他，并对他很了解的人，我个人的叙述就不能说是多余的了。假如有个人跟艾尔·格列柯像我同斯特里克兰一样熟稔，为了读到这个人写的关于格列柯的回忆录，我们为什么舍不得花些时间呢？

但是，我不会以这些借口为自己辩解。我忘了是谁曾经建议过，为了让灵魂受益，一个人每天应该做两件不喜欢的事情。说这话的人是个智者，这句话本身也是个格言，我一丝不苟地遵守。所以每天硬着头皮起床，逼着自己睡觉。在本性上我是一个严格的苦行主义者，我每周都会让肉体经受一次更加严酷的磨难。我没有漏读过一期《泰晤士报》的文学增刊。试想每天洋洋万言的书籍被写出来，作者们满怀希望地看着它们出版，惴惴不安地等待着命运的安排，这也是有益身心的磨炼。若一本书能够从书堆中脱颖而出，这希望会是多么的渺茫！那些所谓成功的书也只不过是季节性的。只有天知道作者遭受了多少痛苦，历经了多少苦难，承受了多少伤心，才能侥幸给读者几个小时的休闲，或者打发掉他们在旅途中的单调与乏味。我可以从书评中作出判断，这些书中很多都是作者精心的力作，有些是殚精竭虑，有些甚至是终其一生的呕心沥血之作。我从中得到的教训是，作者应该从创作的喜悦和放下沉重的思想包袱中获得回报，对于其他别的东西都可以漠然待之，根本不用去在乎什么赞扬或责难、成功或失败。

现在战争来了，随之而来的是一种新的态度。年轻人已经求助于我们过去不了解的神祇，已经有可能看到那些继我们之后的年轻人活动的方向了。年轻的一代，他们意识到了力量与喧嚣，不再敲门，蜂拥而至，占据了我们的座位。空气中吵吵闹闹，充斥着他们的喊叫。某些老一代人，模仿着年轻人滑稽的行为，努力说服自己他们尚未落伍，他们用最高音量大声叫喊，但是他们口中犹如战斗时的呐喊已经变得空洞；他们就像可怜的荡妇，试图用眉笔、化妆和脂粉，靠尖声的媚笑来唤回青春的幻影；聪明一点的则做出优雅的姿态。在他们多少有点抑制的微笑中有着某种放纵的讥讽，因为他们还记得自己也曾经把稳坐钓鱼台的一代踩在脚下，那一代人也曾高声喊叫，也曾带着这种讥讽，他们也曾预见这些勇敢的火炬手们有朝一日会让位于人。世上没有什么终极箴言，当尼尼微城[15]把自己的伟大吹上天时，新的福音[16]已经作古。那些说豪言壮语的人以为他们的话很新颖，可实际上这些话前人已经说过百遍，连腔调都几乎没有变化。钟摆来回摇摆，这一循环永不停歇。

有时，一个人在一个时代活了相当长的时间，而且有了一定地位，当进入另一个时代，他会感到陌生，而这种违和感呈现了人类喜剧中最为奇特的景象。比如，今天还有谁想得到乔治·克雷布[17]呢？这位当时著名的诗人，大家一致认为他是个天才，而由于现代生活的复杂性进一步加强，这种一致公认的情况变得比较罕见了。他从亚历山大·蒲柏[18]那一派学得写诗的技巧，用押韵的双行体形式创作道德故事。后来，法国爆发了大革命和拿破仑战争，诗人们都开始作新歌、唱新曲了，可克雷布先生还是继续用押韵的双行体写他的道德故事，我认为他肯定已经读过那些年轻人所写的搅动世界的诗歌了，而且我还能想象得到，他会认为这些新诗肤浅贫乏。当然，这些新诗大多的确如此。但是济慈和华兹华斯的颂歌，还有柯勒律治的一两首诗歌，以及雪莱的更多的几首诗歌，发现了前人所未探及的广袤的精神领域。克雷布先生虽然已经过气，但他仍然继续用押韵的双行体写他的道德故事。我也曾断断续续地读过一些年轻一代的作品，在他们当中，可能有更加热烈的济慈和更加空灵的雪莱，他们已经发表了很多被世人所愿意记忆的作品，但我说不好这一点。我欣赏他们的诗艺——他们的青春已经很完美，再说什么前途无量似乎已经荒唐。我惊叹于他们风格的恰如其分，但是虽然他们用词丰富（从词汇量上看，似乎在摇篮里时，他们就翻读过罗杰的《词汇宝典》了），在我看来，他们的诗歌却言之无物：在我脑海中，他们知道得太多，感受得太明显，他们轻拍我后背的亲密劲儿或者全身扑向我怀中的热烈情感，我还真受不了；他们的激情有点贫血，他们的梦想有点平淡枯燥。我不喜欢他们。我也已经过气，我也会继续用押韵的双行体来写道德故事，但是，如果说我这么做只是为了自娱自乐的话，我就会是天大的傻瓜了。





第三章


但是，我上面所说这些话只是一个铺垫。

我写第一本书时还很年轻，受到命运的垂青，我的处女作甫一问世便引起轰动，各色人等竞相与我结识。

我刚被引介到伦敦的文人圈子里时，自己既热切又羞怯，回忆起当时的情景还难免有些许的忧郁。很长时间我都没有光顾那个圈子了，如果现在很多小说里描写的是真实的，则如今已经今非昔比了。圈子所在的地点也不同了，切尔西和布鲁姆斯伯里取代了汉普斯特德、诺丁山门和肯辛顿的高街。那时，不到四十岁就出名就会被认为是出类拔萃，而现在超过了二十五岁才出名会让人觉得很荒唐。我想在那些日子里我们有点羞于表露自己的感情，害怕过分张扬会引起嘲笑。我不相信在放浪形骸的文人圈里会有什么严谨的纯洁文化，但我也不记得那时会有在今天似乎大行其道的滥交。我们把怪诞的行为遮上一层体面缄默的幕布，并不认为这是虚伪的。我们讲话含蓄，并不直截了当，而且那时女人也没有完全取得独立自主的地位。

我住在维多利亚火车站附近，记得我不得不坐公交车走很远的路，才能到达热情好客的文人圈子人们的家里。在怯懦心理作祟下，我要在街上来回徘徊几次，才能鼓起勇气按响门铃。随后，惶恐不安地被领进一个透不过气、高朋满座的房间。我被介绍给一个又一个名人雅士，他们对我的书的褒奖之词更让我局促不安。我觉得他们指望我说些妙言隽语，但我直到聚会结束，也没有想出什么风趣的话来，我只好用端茶倒水，把切得乱七八糟的黄油面包递给别人来掩饰我的尴尬。我不想让人注意到我，这样我就能放松地观察这些赫赫有名的人物和聆听他们睿智有趣的谈话。

我记得聚会上有一些身材高大，腰板笔直，大鼻子而眼神放光的女人，穿着如同甲胄的服装；也有一些身材矮小，像小老鼠一样的老处女，说话细声细气，眼睛滴溜乱转。我一直既好奇又好笑，她们始终戴着手套去吃抹着黄油的面包片，随后，我又观察到她们在以为没人注意的时候，把手指上的残留物往椅子上揩，那种漠然的劲头让我着实佩服。这种行为肯定对家具不好，但我也能想到，当轮到这家的女主人回访她们家的时候，她也会对她朋友家的家具实施同样的报复手段的。有些女人穿着时髦，她们说她们怎么也看不出为什么一个人写出一部小说就要穿得邋里邋遢。如果你身材很好为什么不去尽量展现呢？一双小脚上穿着时尚的鞋子，绝不会让编辑拒绝采用你的稿子。但是，另外一些女人打扮很轻浮，她们身着“艺术的织品”，戴着蛮荒风格的珠宝首饰。男士们的打扮很少有怪里怪气的，他们尽可能地让自己看上去不像作家，希望别人把他们看作是老于世故的人，无论走到哪里，都像城市里公司的高管。他们总显得有点疲态，我过去压根儿不认识什么作家，我发现他们很奇怪，但是我认为对我来说，他们似乎不太真实。

我记得那时我总觉得他们的谈话不同凡响，他们中的一个同行弟兄刚一转身，他们便会用幽默的谈吐将他刺得体无完肤，让我听得瞠目结舌。艺术家有着世上别的行当的人无法比拟的优势，他们不仅可以嘲笑他们朋友的外貌和性格，还可以嘲笑他们的作品。他们的谈锋所向机智锐利，口若悬河，让我自叹弗如。在那些日子里，聊天要像艺术一样养成，一句巧妙的对答会大受赏识，远远超过锅下荆棘燃烧时的噼啪声受到的关注。格言警句那时还不是笨伯们机械模仿的工具，彬彬有礼的闲谈中随便用上几句便会妙趣横生。令人难过的是，我现在丝毫不记得那些灵光闪烁的妙语了。然而，当谈到我们所从事的艺术的另一面——作为交易的细节来时，我认为那种交谈到头来也不会让人舒服。我们品评完最近一本新书的成就后，就会自然而然地猜测这本书卖出了多少册，作者得到了多少预支稿费，最终他可能会得到多少收益。随后，我们还可能谈到这家出版商，那家出版商，把一家出版商的慷慨和另一家的吝啬做对比。我们还会争论是应该把稿子交给一个版税丰厚的出版商好，还是交给一个会“推广”，彰显书稿价值的出版商好；有些出版商广告做得差，而另外一些则很不错；有些出版商很老套，而另外一些则很摩登。再后来，我们还会谈到代理商以及他们能够为我们争取到的利益，也会谈到各种类型的编辑和他们欢迎哪类稿件，一千字他们能给多少稿费，以及他们付稿费是及时或是拖拉。这些对我来说，都非常具有浪漫的意味，它给了我一种成为某个神秘兄弟会成员的亲密感。





第四章


那时没有谁比萝丝·沃特福德对我更好的了。她身上结合了男性的才智和女性的任性，她写的那些小说很独特，而且读后让人心绪不宁。正是在她的家里，有一天我遇见了查尔斯·斯特里克兰的妻子。那天沃特福德小姐正在举办茶会，她那小房间比平时更为拥挤，每个人似乎都在聊天，而我则安静地坐着，觉得有些尴尬。我性格太内向，所以无法加入任何一堆人的谈话，他们好像都在专注于谈论自己的事情。沃特福德小姐是一位相当不错的女主人，看见了我的窘态就径直朝我走来。

“我想让你和斯特里克兰太太说会儿话，”她说，“她对你的书可是推崇备至。”

“她是干什么的？”我问道。

我意识到自己的孤陋寡闻，如果斯特里克兰太太是位很有名气的作家，我想在我和她说话之前也要把情况摸清楚。

萝丝·沃特福德为了加强她回答的效果，故意把眼帘一垂，装出一本正经的样子。

“她经常举办午餐聚会，你只要别那么腼腆，她会邀请你的。”

萝丝·沃特福德是个玩世不恭的女子，她把生活看成是写小说的机会，把大家作为她小说的素材。如果大家显示出欣赏她的才能，她就会时不时地邀请他们到她的府上，适度破费地款待他们一番。她对大众对名人们崇拜的弱点既感到快乐，又有点鄙夷，但不管怎样，在他们面前她扮演着端庄得体的知名女作家的角色。

我被领到斯特里克兰太太面前，我们在一起聊了有十分钟的时间。除了她的声音很悦耳外，我没发现她有什么特别之处。她在威斯敏斯特有一栋房子，能够看到尚未竣工的大教堂，因为我们住在同一个街区，所以便觉得亲近了一层。对于所有那些住在泰晤士河和圣詹姆斯公园之间的居民来说，陆海军商店就是连接他们的纽带。斯特里克兰太太要了我的地址，几天之后我便收到了她午餐会的邀请。

我的约会很少，所以便欣然接受了邀请。我到得有点晚了，因为我害怕到得太早，所以绕着大教堂走了三圈，进屋时我发现聚会的人已经到齐了。沃特福德小姐已经在那儿了，还有杰伊太太、理查德·特维宁、乔治·罗德也已落座，我们都是作家。那是早春晴朗的一天，大家的兴致很高，我们谈论了很多的事情。来之前，沃特福德小姐甚是纠结，是照她青春年少时的唯美主义打扮呢，她过去参加各种聚会常常要身着淡绿，手持一朵水仙；还是照她成熟女性仪态万方，穿着高跟鞋和巴黎款的女装，戴着一顶新帽子打扮呢。结果她的打扮介于两者之间，这反而让她有了更高的兴致，我还从未听过她用如此俏皮刻薄的语言谈论我们共同的朋友。杰伊太太清楚语不惊人死不休是机智的灵魂，她用比耳语高不了多少的声音发表高见，羞得雪白的桌布也会染上玫瑰色的红晕。理查德·特维宁滔滔不绝地发表着奇谈怪论，而乔治·罗德意识到不必再展示他口吐莲花的才华了，所以只管张开大嘴，不断地往里填上食物。斯特里克兰太太说得不多，但是她有一种可爱的本事，让谈话围绕共同的话题，一旦谈话出现冷场，她就会插入适当的话语使谈话再次进行下去。她这一年三十七岁，身材较高，体态丰满，却不显得肥胖；她说不上漂亮，但是她的面容招人喜爱，也许这要归功于她善良、褐色的双眸。她的肤色不太好，一头乌发梳理得很精巧。她是三个女人中唯一一个没有化妆的，与其他人形成鲜明对照的是，她似乎更为淳朴和自然。

餐厅的布置很符合那个时代的品位，非常朴素，高高的木制白色护墙板，绿色的墙纸上挂着惠斯勒的蚀刻画，用四四方方的黑色框架镶嵌着。绿色的窗帘上有着孔雀图案的设计，笔直地悬挂着，地毯也是绿色的，图案是白色的小兔在枝繁叶茂的树林里追逐嬉戏——显然是受到威廉·莫里斯的影响。壁炉架上摆着白釉蓝彩陶器。彼时，在伦敦一定会有五百家餐厅都是如此一模一样的格调，这种风格雅致，富有艺术气息，但是也有一些沉闷。

当我们离开时，我和沃特福德小姐一路同行，天气很不错，再加上她戴着新帽子提高了兴致，我们决定漫步穿过圣詹姆斯公园。

“刚才的聚会真不错。”我说。

“你觉得饭菜可口吧？我告诉过她，如果她想让作家们登门，就一定得让他们吃好。”

“让人佩服的建议，”我答道，“可是为什么她想跟作家们来往呢？”

沃特福德小姐耸了耸肩。

“她觉得作家有意思，她想赶潮流，我想她很单纯。可怜的人儿，她认为我们都很了不起，反正请我们去吃午餐会让她很开心，对我们也没有坏处，就冲这一点，我就喜欢她。”

现在回想起来，无论是远离尘嚣居于汉普斯特德庙堂之高的雅士，还是处于切恩街寒酸画室的文人，那些追逐名人的人想方设法要把他们揭个底儿朝天，而我认为斯特里克兰太太是这群人中最不会伤害到人的那一类。她还是少女时是在安静的乡下度过的，从穆迪图书馆借来的书不仅给她带来了不少浪漫故事，而且带来了关于伦敦的浪漫遐想。她对阅读有着真正的激情（在她这一类人中是很少见的，大部分人对作者本人的兴趣浓于对作品的兴趣，对画家的好奇甚于对其画作的品鉴），她为自己创设了一个想象中的世界，在那里她生活得自由自在，那种自由是她在日常的现实世界中绝对无法获得的。当她开始了解了作家们之后，就好像她亲自登上了舞台去历险，而不是在舞台脚灯的另一头遥望舞台上的演出。她看见这些作家粉墨登场，真正感到了自己生活的圈子扩大了很多，因为她不仅亲自款待了他们，而且在他们封闭的幽居中拜访他们。她接受了这些人游戏人生的种种规则，并认为这些规则对于作家们来说是天经地义的，但她自己片刻也没有想到要按照他们的规则去调整自己的行为。他们的伦理标准稀奇古怪，就像他们身着的奇装异服，他们的理论和悖论狂野不羁，如同某种娱乐让她觉得趣味盎然，但是对她的信念没有一丝一毫的影响。

“有没有一位斯特里克兰先生呢？”我问道。

“哦，当然有，他在城里做事，我想他是个证券经纪人，他这人非常古板无趣。”

“他俩感情好吗？”

“他们彼此相敬如宾，如果你在他们家吃晚餐你就会遇见他，但斯特里克兰太太不常请人吃晚餐。他很安静，对文学或者艺术没有一丁点儿兴趣。”

“为什么讨人喜欢的女人总是嫁给乏味的男人啊？”

“因为有头脑的男人是不会娶讨人喜欢的女人的。”

我对这话想不出怎么回答好，所以我又问斯特里克兰太太是否有孩子。

“对，她有一个儿子和一个女儿，他俩都在上学。”

这个话题已经没什么可说的了，我们又开始谈起了别的事情。





第五章


在整个夏天，我和斯特里克兰太太见面的次数不算少，我时不时就会去他们家享用令人愉快的小型午餐，还有大型的茶会。我们彼此相处愉快，那时我还很年轻，也许她喜欢这样的想法——要指导我在文学创作的艰苦道路上走好最初的几步，而我也很高兴能有人分享我的小烦恼，能够专注地倾听和给我一些合理的建议。斯特里克兰太太天生富有同情心，这是一种迷人的本领，但是有时会被那些知道自己有这种本领的人滥用，当他们知道了自己朋友的不幸，会像饿虎扑食一般地扑上去，施展自己的灵巧与机敏。同情心像油井一样喷涌而出，肆意播撒着，但却恰恰忘了他们的同情有时会让不幸的人感到尴尬。有的人胸襟上已经洒满了泪水，我就别用我的泪水给人添乱了。斯特里克兰太太对自己的这种长处运用得就很得体，你会觉得接受她的同情反而给她帮了忙，在年轻的热情冲动中，我把我的发现讲给萝丝·沃特福德听，她说道：

“牛奶很好喝，尤其是加上一滴白兰地，但家养的奶牛巴不得把牛奶挤出来，被奶水充得肿胀的奶头很不好受。”

萝丝·沃特福德有一条“毒舌”，没人能像她那样说出这么尖酸刻薄的话来，但另一方面，也没人像她那样干出那么漂亮的事情来。

在斯特里克兰太太身上还有另外一种我喜欢的东西，她能很雅致地布置环境。她的家里总是整洁和欢快，朵朵鲜花把周遭变得很喜庆，客厅里的印花布尽管设计庄重，但是明快而漂亮。食物摆在充满艺术气息的小餐厅里吊人胃口，桌子看上去也很别致。两个女佣很是利落、顺眼。饭菜烹饪得相当不错，斯特里克兰太太是个优秀的持家主妇，对此大家不可能视而不见。你还能确定她是个令人佩服的母亲。在客厅里有她一双儿女的照片。她的儿子名叫罗伯特，是个十六岁的少年，正在拉格比上学。你能看到他穿着法兰绒衣服，头戴板球帽，而另一张照片上则身穿燕尾服，系着直立的领子。他像他母亲，生着光洁的前额，一双好看的、沉思的眼睛，看上去干净、健康又端正。

“我知道他不算很聪明，”一天当我正在端详这张照片的时候，她说，“但我知道他心地善良，性格也招人喜欢。”

斯特里克兰太太的女儿十四岁，她的头发像她的母亲一样浓密乌黑，长发垂肩，也同她的母亲一样，面容和善而安静，眼睛清澈明亮。

“他们俩跟你简直是一个模子刻出来的。”我说。

“没错，我觉得他们更像我，不太像他们的父亲。”

“为什么你从不让我见见他呢？”我问道。

“你想见他？”

她微笑着说，她的微笑真的很甜蜜，而且脸上还泛起了些许的红晕。像她这样年龄的女人动不动就脸红，似乎并不常见。也许她的天真正是她最招人喜欢的地方。

“你知道，他一点文学细胞都没有，”她说，“他完全是个俗人。”

她这么说没有贬损的意思，反而是充满爱意，好像坦承她丈夫的缺点，就可以保护他不受她朋友的嘲弄似的。

“他在证券交易所上班，是个地地道道的证券经纪人，我想他会让你闷得要死的。”

“他让你也觉得很闷吗？”

“你瞧，我正好是他的妻子，我非常爱他。”

她笑着想掩盖她的不好意思，我想她可能担心我会说出一番打趣的话来，她的这种坦白，肯定会引出萝丝·沃特福德挖苦的话来。她踌躇了一会儿，眼神变得更加温柔了。

“他不会假装是个天才，他甚至在证券交易所里也挣不到很多的钱，但他人真的很好，很善良。”

“我想我也会喜欢他的。”

“找时间我会邀请你来和我们一起共进晚餐的，但我得提醒你，是你自己要冒这个风险的，如果你度过一个非常乏味的晚上，你可怨不得我。”





第六章


但是，当我最终见到查尔斯·斯特里克兰的时候，在那种情况下，我不仅结识了他本人，还结识了其他的人。一天上午，斯特里克兰太太让人给我送来一张便条，上面说当天晚上她办一个晚餐聚会，其中一位客人来不了了，她问我是否愿意补缺。她写道：

别说我言之不预，你会厌烦得要死的。从头到尾这都会是个乏味的聚会，但是如果你愿意来，我会不胜感激，而且你我可以聊会儿天。

似乎别无选择，我只能接受。

当斯特里克兰太太把我介绍给她的丈夫时，他漫不经心地跟我握了握手。斯特里克兰太太快乐地转向他，试图跟他开一个小玩笑。

“我请他来，就是给他看看，我的确有个丈夫。我觉得他开始时很是怀疑这一点呢。”

斯特里克兰先生礼貌而短暂地笑了一下，这种笑正是人们假装承认可笑，而实际上他们看不出有什么可笑，又不能明说的敷衍。别的客人陆续到来，主人忙着招呼他们，于是我被晾在了一边。终于等到我们聚齐了，在餐桌边等着宣布晚餐开始，这时我一边和身边一位叫我“关照”的女客聊天，一边思忖，文明人竟会运用这样一种奇怪的、别出心裁的创意，把短暂的生命浪费在这类冗长乏味的活动上。你会纳闷这类聚会为什么女主人会不厌其烦地邀请客人们来，而为什么客人们也不辞劳苦地有请必到。聚会上有十个人，这些人见面时冷淡相对，分手时如释重负。当然，这种聚会纯粹是为了社交。斯特里克兰一家“欠”了很多人的晚餐，哪怕这些人他们丝毫不感兴趣，为了还人情的缘故，他们不得不邀请这些客人来，而这些客人也往往会接受。为什么？为了避免吃饭时，只是夫妇俩相对的乏味，为了让他们的用人休息一下，因为没有原因拒绝，因为他们被“欠”了一顿晚餐。

餐厅很拥挤，让人感到不便。在座的有一位王室法律顾问[19]和他的妻子，一位政府官员和他的妻子，斯特里克兰的姐姐和她丈夫——麦克安德鲁上校，一位议员的妻子。正是因为这位议员大人不能离开议会，我才接到替补的邀请。这些客人的身份都很高贵，他们也很自命不凡。这些太太们做派很足，不太讲究自己的衣着，她们也深知自己的地位，也就不主动去取悦别人。男人们志得意满，总之所有的人都显出心满意足、兴旺发达的样子。

每个人本能地都希望宴会别冷场，所以说话的声调都比正常情况下略高，结果房间里充斥着吵吵嚷嚷的声音。但是，没有大家一起谈论一件事的时候，每个人都在和他的邻座交谈，喝汤、吃鱼和品小菜时和右手边的人交谈，吃烤肉、甜点和开胃小吃时和左手边的人交谈。他们谈论政治形势、高尔夫、他们的孩子，以及最近上演的新戏，他们还谈论皇家学院展出的画作、天气，以及度假的计划。没有片刻的停歇，所以噪声变得更大了。斯特里克兰太太兴许暗自庆幸她举办的聚会获得成功。她的丈夫举止得体，也许他的话不多，我感觉晚宴快结束时，坐在他两旁的女客脸上都露出了倦怠的神色。她们一定觉得他也不轻松，有那么一两次，斯特里克兰太太有些焦虑的目光落在他身上。

最后，她起身带着女士们离开了餐厅，斯特里克兰在她身后关上了门，走到桌子的另一头，坐在了王室法律顾问和政府官员中间，他把波尔图葡萄酒挨个给客人满上，又递给我们每人一根雪茄烟。王室法律顾问对葡萄酒的品质大加赞赏，斯特里克兰告诉我们他从哪里搞到的这种酒。我们又开始谈论起了酿酒和烟草。王室法律顾问跟我们聊起了一桩他正在办的案子，上校谈起了打马球的事。我没什么可聊的，所以安静地坐着，礼貌性地表现出对谈话很感兴趣的样子，因为我知道这些人都跟我毫不相干，所以很放松地观察上了斯特里克兰。他比我料想的还要高大，我不知道为什么我以前想象他身材瘦小，其貌不扬。实际上他生得魁梧壮实，大手大脚。笨拙地穿着晚礼服，难免给你这种想法——一个马夫为了这个场合特意衣冠楚楚了一番。他有四十岁，不好看，也谈不上难看，因为他的五官还算端正，但是似乎都比一般人大了一号，所以看上去有些粗笨。他的胡子刮得精光，那张大脸看上去光秃秃的，让人不怎么舒服。他的头发是红色的，剪得很短，他的小眼睛是蓝色或者灰色的，他看上去相貌平平。我不再纳闷为什么斯特里克兰太太谈到他时有些难为情，对于一个想在艺术和文学圈子里获得一席之地的女人来说，他很难为她增光添彩。很显然他也没有社交的天赋，但这种天赋也并非人人都有，他甚至没有什么奇行怪癖，能够使他脱离庸庸碌碌之辈，他就是一个善良、乏味、诚实、普通的男人。有人兴许会羡慕他身上的优秀品质，但一定不会愿意和他做伴。他是一个微不足道的人，他可能是一个有价值的社会成员，一个好丈夫和好父亲，一个诚实的经纪人，但是没有理由在他的身上浪费时间。





第七章


社交季节接近它枯燥无味的尾声，我认识的每个人都在安排离开伦敦去度假。斯特里克兰太太正打算带着她的家人到诺福克海滨度假，以便孩子们在海中嬉戏，她的丈夫能打打高尔夫。我们彼此道别，安排在秋季再见。可当我在城里的最后一天，从商店里出来时，碰上了她和她的两个孩子。跟我一样，在离开伦敦之前，再最后买些东西。我们几个人又热又累，我提议我们一块儿走，到公园里吃点冷饮。

我觉得斯特里克兰太太很高兴让我看看她的孩子们，于是她欣然接受了邀请。这两个孩子比起照片里样子更引人注目，她有理由以他们为傲，我的年纪也很轻，不会让他们感到和我在一起不好意思，他们开心地聊了一件事又聊起另一件事。两个孩子都特别可爱，健康活泼。我们在树荫下小憩，感到十分惬意。

一个小时之后，他们挤上一辆马车回家去了，我悠闲地踱步走向俱乐部，我也许感到了点孤独，我想正是我无意瞥见的这种温馨的家庭生活让我有点妒忌。他们似乎彼此真心相爱，他们讲些只有自己人才能听得懂的笑话，能够让他们开怀大笑，而外人却莫名其妙。也许查尔斯·斯特里克兰按照能说会道的标准来看，确实是个沉闷的男人，但他的智力应付起周围的一切还是绰绰有余，就像是某种护照，不仅能保证在成功的道路上通行无阻，也能保证在幸福的门槛上不被拦住。斯特里克兰太太是个迷人的女人，而且还很爱他。我想象得出他们的生活不会受到外部风险的困扰，诚实、体面。而且，因为两个上进、招人喜欢的孩子，显而易见他们注定能继承和发扬这家人的地位和传统。斯特里克兰夫妇会不知不觉变老，他们会看到他们的一双儿女到了一定年龄，按照生命的进程结婚生子——这个漂亮的女儿，未来会是健康孩子们的母亲；这个儿子，会成为一个英俊的男子汉，显然还可能成为一名军人。最后，这对夫妇会过上有尊严的、富裕的退休生活，受到子孙后代的爱戴，过完这段幸福的、能发挥余热的生活之后，他们年事已高，会安然离世。

这无疑是无数夫妻生活故事的翻版，这种生活模式给人一种家庭的温馨。它会提醒你，生活就像一条平静的小溪，在郁郁的树荫下，舒缓而蜿蜒地流过绿油油的草原，最后奔向浩瀚的大海。但是，大海是那么的安静，那么的沉寂，那么的漠然，你会突然被某种模糊不清的不安所困扰，也许这只是我天性中的某种怪念头，甚至在那些日子里也很强烈。我觉得这种生活，绝大多数人所共有的这种生活，一定缺失了某种东西。我承认这种生活的社会价值，我也看到了它井然有序的幸福，但是在我的血液中有某种狂热，渴望一种更加狂野的生命历程。于我而言，在如此安详的快乐中，似乎有某种警示。在我内心深处渴望过一种更加冒险的生活，只要我的生活能有所变化——变迁和无法预见的刺激，我已做好充分准备去面对崎岖的岩石和布满暗礁的海滩。





第八章


在阅读我写下的关于斯特里克兰一家人的文字时，我意识到他们似乎不是形象鲜明的。要使书中的人物活灵活现，就要加诸众多性格特征，而我却没能这样做。我知道这个错在我。我绞尽脑汁想记起那些能够使他们生动起来的癖性，我觉得如果老是想着言辞的技巧或者浓笔重墨地描写某种怪癖，我应该能让他们不同凡响，像我现在这种写法，他们就像旧挂毯上的人物，无法把他们和背景区分开来，在远处望去，似乎失去了他们的轮廓，所以到头来除了一片赏心悦目的色彩，你什么也没有看到。我唯一的借口就是他们给我的印象就是如此，他们本身就是模糊不清的。你会发现有些人的生活就是社会有机体的一部分，他们存在于这个有机体内，也只有依靠这个有机体才能生活，他们就像身体里的细胞，是最基本的东西，但是只要他们保持健康，就会被吞没在重大的整体之中。斯特里克兰一家是属于中产阶级中普通的家庭。一位可爱的、好客的女主人，对文艺界的小名人有着无害的狂热；一位沉闷的男主人，在慈悲的上帝安排给他的那种生活状态中恪守职责；一双面容姣好、健康的儿女。没有什么比这再普通不过的了，我不知道在他们身上有什么东西能激起人们好奇的关注。

当我后来反思所发生的一切时，我扪心自问，是否我过于愚钝没有看出在查尔斯·斯特里克兰身上至少有些与众不同的东西呀。也许吧，从那时到现在已经过去了这么多年，在这段时间里，我对人性有了更深的认识。但是，即使今天我的阅历更丰富了，我相信我对他们的判断和我第一次遇见斯特里克兰一家时也不会有什么不同。可因为我已经认识到人类是变幻莫测的，今天的我就不会那么大吃一惊了。而那一年的早秋，当我回到伦敦时，我被听到的消息吓了一大跳。

我回来还不到一天呢，就在杰尔敏大街上偶遇了萝丝·沃特福德。“你看上去喜气洋洋的，”我说，“有什么开心事吗？”

她微笑着，眼睛里闪烁着我早已熟知的刻毒。这意味着她又听到了某位朋友的丑闻了，这位女文人的本能是很警觉的。

“你已经见过了查尔斯·斯特里克兰，对吧？”

不仅她的脸，就连她的整个身子，都给人一种幸灾乐祸窃喜的感觉。我点了点头。我很好奇是不是这个倒霉蛋在证券交易所蚀了老本儿，或者被小公交车给撞了。

“难道不是太吓人了吗？他扔下老婆跑了。”

沃特福德小姐当然觉得她不能在杰尔敏大街的马路牙子上对这个主题来发挥太多，所以，就像一个艺术家所做的那样，仅仅把简单的事实抛出来，而后又声明她不知道具体细节，但是我想让她多讲一些，觉得不值一提的环境不应妨碍她给我讲述故事。但是她固执地不肯多讲。

“我跟你说了我什么都不清楚。”她说，以此来打发令我激动的问题。随后，她轻快地耸了耸肩，话中有话地说：“我认为城里茶社的某个年轻姑娘也离开了。”

她冲我笑了一笑，号称自己和牙医已经约好了，便神气十足地扬长而去。这个消息与其说让我难过，不如说让我感兴趣。在那些日子里，我第一手的生活阅历还很少，因此在我碰到这样一件我在书本里才能阅读到的故事时，觉得激动不已。我承认岁月已经能让现在的我适应我的熟人中出现这类事情了。但是，那时我还是有点震惊，斯特里克兰已经四十岁了，我认为像他这样年纪的人再牵扯到这种爱情瓜葛中未免令人作呕。特别是我年轻时有点目空一切，把三十五岁作为上限，到了这个年龄一个男人不应该再像个傻瓜一样陷入爱情不能自拔。这个消息让我个人有些不安，因为我在乡下时给斯特里克兰太太写了一封信，告诉了她我回来的日子，并且补充道除非我收到她表示反对的回信，否则我会在某一天约她一起喝茶的。今天正好是约定的日子，我也没有收到来自斯特里克兰太太的只言片语。她想见我还是不想见我呢？很有可能那段时间斯特里克兰太太正处于天塌地陷的阶段，她早把我信的事儿给忘了。也许我应该更明智点儿不要去。另一方面，她可能希望这事不要张扬出去，在我这方面，如果给出任何信号，表明我已经知道了这件离奇的事，可能会很草率。我一方面害怕伤害一位善良女人的感情，另一方面，也害怕真去了她家，反而会伤害她，我在去与不去之间纠结。我觉得她一定处于痛苦中，我不忍心看见她受苦而爱莫能助，但是，在我的内心中，却渴望看到她如何处理这件事，这种想法让我感到有点羞愧，我不知道该怎么办好了。

最后，我突然想到我可以去她的府上，好像什么事都没发生。我让女佣转达一声，问问斯特里克兰太太是否方便见我，这样可以给她一个机会把我打发走。但是，当我向女佣说出我肚子里早已准备好的话时，我还是感到了无地自容般的尴尬。我在黑黢黢的过道里等着回话，鼓起了全部的勇气才没中途溜掉。女佣回来了，她的神情，在我激动的猜想中，表明已经完全知道了这家人的不幸。

“请您这边走，先生。”她招呼道。

我跟着她走进了客厅。窗帘半拉着让房间变得更暗，斯特里克兰太太背对光线坐着。她的姐夫，麦克安德鲁上校，站在壁炉的前面，让没有燃旺的炉火烤着他的背。我暗自思忖，我的到访似乎非常尴尬，我能想象到我的到来让他们感到有些吃惊，斯特里克兰太太只是因为忘记了把和我定的约会延期才让我进来的。我感觉到上校因为我的打扰而有些生气。

“我不太肯定，你是不是等着我来。”我说，故意装作若无其事的样子。

“当然我在等你，安妮马上会端上茶来。”

即使在黑暗的房间里，我也看到斯特里克兰太太的眼睛哭肿了，脸上满是泪痕，她的皮肤本来就不太好，现在变成了土黄色。

“你还记得我的姐夫吧，对吗？就在假期之前，你们在晚宴上见过。”

我们握了握手，我觉得很难为情，一时想不出什么话说，但是，斯特里克兰太太给我救了场。她问我整个夏天我自己都在做些什么，在这个话题的帮助下，我想方设法地找了些话说，直到女佣把茶端了上来。上校要了一杯苏打威士忌。

“你最好也来一杯吧，艾米[20]。”他说。

“不，我还是要茶吧。”

这是表示发生了不幸事的第一次暗示。我故意不做理会，尽量和斯特里克兰太太东拉西扯。上校仍然站在壁炉前面，一言不发。我考虑应该尽早体面地离开，同时我也问自己斯特里克兰太太让我进来究竟出于什么考虑。在夏天度假前撤掉的花儿和其他的一些小摆设，现在没有被放回原位，房间里显得凄苦和毫无生气，而在以前，这间屋子似乎总是会显得友好温暖。它给人一种很奇怪的感觉，好像墙的另一面正停放着一个死人。我把茶喝完了。

“你想抽支香烟吗？”斯特里克兰太太问道。

她四下里找了找烟盒，可没有找到。

“恐怕是没有烟了。”

突然她泪如泉涌，匆忙走出了客厅。

我吃了一惊，猜想以前雷打不变的都是她丈夫买烟，现在屋里竟然没烟了，让她又不知不觉地想到了他，她过去唾手可得的东西现在失去了，这种新感觉给了她当头一棒。她意识到美好的旧时光一去不复返了，我们的社交体面可能难以为继了。

“我敢说你想让我走了。”我一边对上校说着，一边站起身来。

“我估计你已经听说了那个无赖把她给抛弃的事了。”上校爆发般地吼着。

我迟疑了一下。

“你知道有人就是爱说三道四，”我回答道，“有人含含糊糊地告诉我这儿出了点事。”

“他跑了。跟一个女人去了巴黎，他一个便士也没给艾米留下。”

“我感到很难过。”我说道，往下又不知道该怎么说了。

上校一口气把威士忌灌了下去。他个头很高，瘦瘦的，大约五十岁的年纪，胡须向下垂着，头发花白，他有一双浅蓝色的眼睛，一张小嘴。从上次见他起，我就记得他一脸傻气，总是很骄傲地告诉别人，在他离开军队以前，一周总要打三次马球，十年都没间断过。

“我想斯特里克兰太太现在不想让我打扰她吧，”我说，“您能告诉她我是多么为她难过吗？如果有什么事需要我帮忙，我将乐意效劳。”

他没理会我的话。

“我不知道以后她怎么办，还有这两个孩子，难道让他们喝西北风吗？十七年了。”

“什么十七年了？”

“他们结婚十七年了，”他没好气地说，“我压根就不喜欢他，当然，既然他是我的连襟，我尽量维持面上的关系。你认为他是个绅士吗？她根本就不应该嫁给他。”

“他俩的夫妻关系真的就完了，没有挽回的余地了吗？”

“她唯一可做的就是跟他离婚。你进来时我正跟她说到这一点。‘把离婚申请交上去吧，我亲爱的艾米，’我说，‘你得为你自己想想，为孩子们想想。’他最好别让我看见，否则我非得把他千刀万剐不可。”

我忍不住想到麦克安德鲁上校要想这么做可不大容易，因为斯特里克兰给我很深的印象是他体格强壮。但我也没说什么。当激愤的道德手无缚鸡之力地去直接惩罚罪恶，这是件多么痛苦不堪的事情。我打定主意再次打算告辞时，斯特里克兰太太又走了进来，她已经揩干了眼泪，在脸上扑了粉。

“对不起，我没控制住，”她说，“我很高兴你没走。”

她坐了下来。我还是压根不知道说些什么好。要提及与我完全不相干的事，我还真不知道怎么开口。我那时还不知道女人身上摆脱不掉的那种毛病——总是热衷和任何一个愿意倾听的人去讨论她们的私事。斯特里克兰太太似乎在努力控制着自己。

“人们都在议论这件事吗？”她问道。

我有点不知所措，她好像认定我完全知道了她的家门不幸。

“我只是刚刚回来，就见到了萝丝·沃特福德一个人。”

斯特里克兰太太拍了一下手。

“一字不落地告诉我她都说了些什么。”看见我有点犹豫不决，她坚持让我说，“我特别想知道她都跟你说了什么。”

“你知道人们说闲话的样子，她这个人也不靠谱，对吧？她说你的丈夫离开了你。”

“就这些吗？”

我不愿意重复萝丝·沃特福德在和我分手时，暗示茶社里的一个姑娘也同时离开了的话，我于是只能撒了个谎。

“她没说他和谁一起走的吗？”

“没说。”

“这就是我想知道的了。”

我有点迷惑不解，但不管怎样，我明白现在可以告辞了。当我和斯特里克兰太太握手道别时，我告诉她如果有需要我的地方，我很乐意为她效劳。她苍白的脸上露出了一丝微笑。

“十分感谢，我不知道有谁能替我做什么。”

我太过羞怯，没能表达出我的同情。我转身向上校告别，他没有跟我握手。

“我也要走了，如果你走维多利亚大街，我和你一块儿走走。”

“好吧，”我说，“走吧。”





第九章


“这是件可怕的事。”我们刚一走到街上，上校就开口说道。

我这才意识到他要跟我一起走是为了跟我再度讨论这件事，显然他已经跟他的妻妹讨论好几个小时了。

“我们不知道那个女人是谁，你知道，”他说，“我们就知道那个无赖去巴黎了。”

“我原以为他们夫妇俩感情很好呢。”

“是不错，唉，就在你来以前，艾米还说他们结婚以后从未红过脸呢，你了解艾米，世上绝无仅有的好女人。”

既然人家已经把这些秘密告诉了我，我想我多问几个问题也无妨了。

“你的意思是说，她事前没怀疑过什么吗？”

“一点儿也没有，他在八月份还跟她和孩子们一起在诺福克度假呢。他和往常一样，我和我妻子还跟他们一起待了两三天，我跟他一块儿打了高尔夫呢。他九月份回到城里，好替换他的合伙人，让人家也去度假。艾米和孩子们仍然留在乡下，因为他们租了六周的房子，在租期快到的时候，艾米写信给他，告诉她回伦敦的日期。他从巴黎写了回信，说他已经下定决心不再和她一起生活了。”

“他解释原因了吗？”

“我亲爱的伙计，他什么解释也没说，我看了这封信，不超过十行字。”

“这真是怪了。”

这时我们碰巧得过马路了，过往的车辆把我们的话打断了。麦克安德鲁上校跟我说的话似乎难以让人置信，我怀疑斯特里克兰太太出于个人的原因，对上校隐瞒了部分事实真相。很显然，一个男人结婚十七年，不会无缘无故抛弃他的妻子离家出走的，其中一定有让斯特里克兰太太怀疑他们婚姻生活中不如意的地方。上校这时赶上了我。

“当然，他根本无法解释，除了他承认和一个女人私奔了。我想他以为艾米自己能发现呢，他就是这么个东西。”

“斯特里克兰太太打算怎么办？”

“嗯，首先我们要找到证据，我打算亲自去趟巴黎。”

“他的生意怎么办？”

“这正是他城府很深的地方，一年来，他逐步把生意越缩越小。”

“他告诉了他的合伙人他打算离开吗？”

“没说一个字。”

麦克安德鲁上校对生意上的事情只了解个大概，而我则一窍不通。所以我不是很明白斯特里克兰是在什么条件下丢下他的生意一走了之。我了解到的是，那个被甩了的合伙人十分生气，威胁要打官司。等到把这件事弄妥当，好像这位合伙人要从口袋里破费四百到五百英镑。

“幸运的是，这房子里的家具都在艾米的名下，不管怎样，她多少还能留下点儿东西。”

“你刚才说的她一个便士也没得到，这话可是真的？”

“当然是真的，她自己手里还有两三百英镑，还有这些家具。”

“那她靠什么生活呀？”

“只有上帝知道。”

事情变得似乎愈发的复杂了，而上校的骂骂咧咧和怒火冲天把我搞得一头雾水，而不是把情况搞得更清楚了。让我高兴的是，当看到陆海军商店钟表的指针时，他记起和人约好在俱乐部打牌的事儿，于是他和我分了手，抄近道穿过了圣詹姆斯公园。





第十章


一两天以后，斯特里克兰太太派人给我送来一张纸条，问我是否能在晚饭后去看看她。我到了她家，只有她一个人，她身着黑色的衣服，朴素得近于苦行，让人想起她目前遭遇变故后的孤寂。我因为不谙世故，所以很吃惊，尽管她悲痛的感情是真实的，但就在这种情况下，她也能够按照得体观念，使自己的衣着符合她所扮演的角色。

“你说过如果我想让你做任何事，你都不会介意的，是不是？”她问道。

“千真万确。”

“你愿意去趟巴黎，去见见查理[21]吗？”

“我吗？”

我吃了一惊。我想我和他只见过一次，我不知道她想让我干什么。

“弗雷德本打算要去，”弗雷德就是麦克安德鲁上校，“但我确信他去不合适，他只会把事情弄得更糟，我不知道还有谁能帮我。”

她的声音有点颤抖，我觉得我要是有片刻的犹豫也是一种残忍。

“但是我和你丈夫说过的话不超过十句，他不认识我。他可能只会让我滚开的。”

“那对你也没有伤害呀。”斯特里克兰太太笑着说。

“那你究竟想让我去干什么呢？”

她没有直接回答。

“我觉得他不认识你反而是个优势，你知道，他对弗雷德从来没有好感，他觉得他是个傻瓜；他不理解军人。弗雷德爱意气用事，如果他们大吵一通，事情反而不好办了。如果你说你是代表我去的，他是不会拒绝同你谈谈的。”

“我同你们认识的时间不长，”我答道，“我不想刺探与我不相关的事，但我看不出能指望谁来处理这样一件事，除非他能了解所有的细节。再者说了，你为什么不亲自去一趟呢？”

“你忘了他可不是一个人。”

我没再说什么。我好像看见我正在拜访查尔斯·斯特里克兰，递上我的名片，看见他走进房间，用食指和拇指夹着我的名片。

“请问您有何贵干？”

“我来是为了您太太的事儿。”

“真的，当你年龄再大一点，你无疑就会学到事不关己高高挂起的好处了。如果你识趣，把头稍微向左边转一下，你就会看到那扇门。再会。”

我可以预见，当我出门的时候，很难再保持体面尊严了。我真希望我还没有回伦敦，等斯特里克兰太太解决了她的难题后我再回来。我偷偷地瞄了她一眼，她正陷于沉思中，但是她马上抬头看着我，深深地叹了口气，微微笑了一下。

“真是太出乎意料了，”她说，“我们结婚有十七年了，我做梦也没想到查理会是这样一种人，会迷恋上某个女人。我们一直相处得很好。当然，我有很多的兴趣爱好，而他不能分享。”

“你发现了谁？”——我不太清楚自己怎么能说得更明白些——“那个人是谁？就是他和谁一起私奔了？”

“没有，好像没人知道。这点挺奇怪。一般来说，如果一个男人爱上了某个女人，人们一定会看到他们出双入对的，一起吃个午饭或者别的什么事情。妻子的朋友们总是会来告诉她一声的。我没有得到任何警示——什么都没有。他的那封来信好像一个晴天霹雳，我原以为他一直特别幸福哩。”

她开始哭了，可怜的女人，我也为她感到非常难过。但是，一会儿以后，她变得更加镇静了。

“让别人看笑话，对自己没好处。”她擦干了泪水说道，“唯一要做的事是决定什么是万全之策。”

她继续说着，有点语无伦次，一会儿说刚刚过去的事，一会儿又说他们初次的相遇和结婚后的事，但是现在我才开始在脑海中形成他们生活连贯的画面。这些画面也似乎证明了我以前的猜测是正确的。斯特里克兰太太是一位驻印度文官的女儿，她的父亲退休之后，一家人定居在偏远的乡下。但每年的八月，她父亲都会带着家人来到伊斯特本[22]换换空气；就是在那儿，她正当二十岁的芳龄时遇见了查尔斯·斯特里克兰，当年他二十三岁。他们在一起玩网球，一起在海滨大道上散步，一起听黑人流浪歌手唱歌；在他正式求婚前的一个星期她就下决心和他在一起了。他们定居在伦敦，先是住在汉普斯特德区，后来，当他的经济状况好转后，他们就搬到城里来了，两个孩子随后陆续降生。

“他似乎非常喜欢两个孩子，即使他厌倦了我，我也奇怪他怎么会舍得离开孩子，一切都是那么不可思议，直到现在我也无法相信这是真的。”

最后，她给我看了那封他写给她的信，我本来对这封信就很好奇，只是不敢贸然提出来想看这封信。

我亲爱的艾米：

我想你会发现房子里的一切我都安排好了。我已经转告了安妮你的指示。当你们到家的时候，晚饭已经为你和孩子们准备好了。我不会在家里迎接你们了。我已经下定决心跟你分开过了，我将在今天上午去巴黎。我到的时候会把这封信寄出去。我不会回去了，我的决定是不可改变的。

你永远的

查尔斯·斯特里克兰

“没有一句话的解释或者歉疚的表示，你难道不认为这个人太没人情味了吗？”

“在这种情况下，这封信是挺奇怪的。”我回答说。

“只有一个解释，那就是他已经不再是他自己了。我不知道这个女人是谁，她已经把他牢牢掌控了，但是她已经把他变成了另外一个人，显然这不是一朝一夕了。”

“你这么想，有什么证据吗？”

“弗雷德已经发现了。我丈夫每周总有三四个晚上说去俱乐部打桥牌，弗雷德认识这家俱乐部的一个成员，跟那人说起查尔斯是个打桥牌的好手时，那人很吃惊。他说他从没见查尔斯去过棋牌室，现在再清楚不过了，当我以为查尔斯在俱乐部打桥牌时，他正跟那个女人在一起。”

我沉默了一会儿，然后我想到了孩子们。

“一定很难跟罗伯特解释这件事吧。”我说道。

“哦，我还没跟他俩提一个字呢，你知道，我们是在他俩不得不返校的头一天回到城里的。我稳住了情绪，告诉他们父亲因为生意上的事外出了。”

斯特里克兰太太遭受突然的打击，心里藏着这个秘密，还能举止得体，装作若无其事的样子，这真是难为她了。而且，她还要把注意力放在把一切事情安排妥当，把两个孩子安心打发走，对她来说，也真不容易。斯特里克兰太太的话音又哽咽了。

“我可怜的宝贝们，他们以后该怎么办呀？这让我们可怎么活呀？”

她挣扎着想控制着自己的情绪，我看见她的手抽搐般地一会儿攥着，一会儿又松开，这种痛苦真是万箭穿心呀。

“如果你认为我去巴黎有好处，我当然会去，但是你必须确切地告诉我，你想让我做什么。”

“我想让他回家。”

“我听麦克安德鲁上校的意思，你已经决定和他离婚了。”

“我绝不会和他离婚。”她咬牙切齿地回答，“把我的话告诉他，他永远别想和那个女人结婚，我和他一样执拗，我永远不会和他离婚，我要为我的孩子着想。”

我想她补充的这番话是为了向我解释她的态度，但是我认为这种态度与其说是母爱，还不如说是很自然的嫉妒心。

“那你还爱他吗？”

“我不知道，我就想让他回来。如果他回来了，我会既往不咎。毕竟我们结婚十七年了，我是个心胸宽阔的女人，只要我不知道他干了什么，我不会介意他的行为的。他一定也知道他对那个女人的迷恋不会持续多久的。如果他现在回来了，一切都会风平浪静的，没人知道究竟是怎么回事。”

斯特里克兰太太这样介意流言蜚语，多少让我心底有点发凉。因为我不知道别人的看法在一个女人的生活中竟然起到这么大的作用，这种在乎给她们那种最深沉的感情投下了一抹不真诚的阴影。

斯特里克兰现在住在哪儿大家是知道的。他的合伙人写了一封言辞激烈的信，派人送到了他有存款的银行，在信中合伙人奚落他像老鼠一样躲了起来。而斯特里克兰也写了一封冷嘲热讽的回信，告诉他的合伙人在哪儿可以准确无误地找到他，目前他好像住在旅馆里。

“我从来没听说过这家旅馆，”斯特里克兰太太说，“不过弗雷德很清楚，他说这家旅馆很贵。”

她的脸涨得通红。我猜测她似乎看到她丈夫正安顿在一间豪华套房里，在一家又一家讲究的饭店里吃饭，她的脑海中浮现她丈夫正在花天酒地，白天去马场，晚上去剧场。

“他这个岁数，不能这么折腾下去了，”她说，“说到底，他也四十岁了，一个小伙子这样做，我还能理解，但他这个岁数的男人，孩子都快成人了，还这样做，岂不是很可怕！再说身体也受不了哇。”

愤怒和悲悯在她的心中斗争着。

“告诉他，我们的家在呼唤他回来。家里一切照旧，可一切又完全不同了。没有他我活不下去。我迟早会自杀的。跟他谈谈过去，谈谈我们共同的经历。当孩子们问起他来，我可怎么说呀？他的房间和他离开时一模一样，正等着他回来。我们大家也正等着他回来。”

现在她明白无误地告诉了我，见到斯特里克兰我应该怎么说。她甚至想到了斯特里克兰会怎么说，告诉了我如何周全地回答。

“你一定会尽力帮我的，是吧？”她可怜巴巴地说，“把我现在的处境告诉他。”

我明白她希望我竭尽所能地唤起他的同情心，她的眼泪一个劲儿地往下落，我被深深地打动了，我对斯特里克兰的冷酷无情义愤填膺，我答应她会尽我的全力把他带回来。我同意第二天就动身，在巴黎一直待到事情多少有些进展再说。这时，天色渐渐暗了下来，在经过了感情大起大落后，我们两人都有点精疲力竭，于是我向她告辞了。





第十一章


在路上，我又把这次的使命考虑了一番，还是有点忐忑不安。现在既然我可以从斯特里克兰太太痛不欲生的现场中解脱出来，就可以更加冷静地梳理一下这件事了。让我想不透的是她行为上的矛盾，她是很不幸，可是为了激起我的同情，她竟然能够在不幸上作秀。很显然她已经为哭哭啼啼做好了准备，因为事先她已经备好了一大堆手帕。我虽然佩服她的深谋远虑，但再回想起来，她的泪水也许就不那么打动人了。我甚至都不能断定，她希望她丈夫回家，是因为她爱他，还是因为她害怕被流言蜚语所淹没。我还怀疑她由于爱的痛苦，那份受到侮辱的爱，在她那受到打击的破碎的心中还能否保持忠贞，也许正掺杂着受伤的虚荣。想到这一点让我很烦躁，好像玷污了我年轻的心灵。那时我还没有洞察人的本性是多么的矛盾，我也不知道在真诚之中有多少是在故作姿态，在高贵中藏着多少卑劣，或者在堕落中也能发现美德。

但是，我这趟差事多少还是有些冒险的成分，当我快到巴黎时，精神反而振奋了起来。从戏剧的角度来看，我对自己所扮演的角色很开心，受朋友所托，要把一位误入歧途的丈夫带回到他宽宏大量的妻子身边。我决定第二天傍晚再去找斯特里克兰，因为我本能地觉得见他的那一时刻必须仔细选择，在我看来，在午饭前想唤起各种感情是不太可能达到效果的。那时我自己的心里就不断充满爱情的遐想，但直到下午茶的时候，才能想象到婚姻的幸福。

我在自己住的旅馆里打听查尔斯·斯特里克兰所住的地方，得知他住的旅馆名叫比利时旅馆，但是多少让我感到有些意外的是，门房说他从未听说过这家旅馆，我原来从斯特里克兰太太那儿听说的是一家很大的、奢华的旅馆，位于瑞沃利路的后面。我们一起查阅了旅馆指南大全，发现叫这个名字的旅馆只有一家，位于莫伊内斯路。旅馆所在地区比较偏僻，甚至都称不上体面。我摇了摇头。

“我敢说不是这家。”我说。

门房耸了耸肩膀。在巴黎叫这个名字的旅馆只此一家。我突然想到，斯特里克兰本来是要隐匿他的地址的。在给他的合伙人我所知道的这个地址时，他也许就想捉弄一下他。我不知道为什么冒出了一个念头，斯特里克兰的恶作剧正符合他的幽默感，让一个怒火冲天的证券经纪人奔到巴黎，在一个下流街区名声很坏的房子里出尽洋相。尽管如此，我想最好还是亲自去看看。第二天大约六点钟，我叫了辆马车驶向莫伊内斯路。在街角我就下了车，因为我想步行到那家旅馆，先观察一下再进去。这条街道，两旁布满为穷人开设的小商店，大约在街道的中间位置，我沿街走下来的左手边就是比利时旅馆。我自己住的旅馆虽然已经挺普通的，但如果和这间旅馆相比，可以称得上是金碧辉煌了。它是一座高高的、破败的建筑，已经很多年没有粉刷过了，脏兮兮的模样反而衬托着两边其他房屋看上去整齐和干净。肮脏的窗户都紧闭着。不会是这儿的，查尔斯·斯特里克兰应该和勾引他的不知名的女子住在充满罪恶感的豪华旅馆中，为了那个女人他抛弃了荣誉和责任。我很恼火，因为觉得我也被捉弄了。我几乎打算不再打听一下就转身离去，但我还是进去了，只是为了能够回头告诉斯特里克兰太太我已经尽力了。

旅馆的门在一家小商店的一侧，门开着，一进门就看见一块牌子：前台在二楼[23]。我沿着狭窄的楼梯走上去，在楼梯平台看到一个用玻璃围起来的小隔间，里面放了一张桌子和几把椅子，外面放了一条长凳，也许晚上守门人就在上面度过了许许多多难熬的夜晚。四下没人，但是在一个电铃的下面写着侍者[24]的字样，我按了铃，马上来了一位侍者。他是一个年轻人，贼眉鼠眼，一脸晦气，身着短袖上衣，脚穿毡子拖鞋。

我不知道为什么我要让询问听上去尽可能的轻松。

“碰巧有位叫斯特里克兰的先生住在这儿吗？”我问道。

“三十二号房间，在六层。”

我很吃惊，半天没说出话来。

“他在吗？”

侍者看了看前台[25]挂钥匙的木板。

“他房间的钥匙没在那儿，你自己上去看看吧。”

我想还是多问一下好。

“夫人在吗？[26]”

“就先生一个人住这儿。[27]”

当我上楼梯时，侍者满脸狐疑地看着我。楼梯黑黢黢的，空气又不流通。一股污浊的霉味扑面而来。走到三层时，一个女人穿着睡衣，头发乱蓬蓬的，打开门一声不吭地看我走了过去。终于我爬到了六楼，敲了敲门牌号是三十二号的房门。里面有动静，随后房门打开了一半，查尔斯·斯特里克兰站到了我面前。他没说话，显然没认出我来。

我告诉了他我的姓名，尽量摆出一副大大咧咧的样子。

“你不记得我了，我七月份曾荣幸地跟你共进过晚餐。”

“进来吧，”他轻快地说，“见到你很高兴，坐吧。”

我进了屋，才发现房间很小，在法国被称为路易·菲利浦款式的家具把房间挤得满满的。有一张大木床，床上是鼓鼓囊囊的鸭绒被，还有一个大立柜，一张圆桌，一个很小的洗脸架，两把软座椅子，包着红色棱纹平布[28]。每件东西都是脏兮兮和破破烂烂的。麦克安德鲁上校煞有介事地描述的那种穷奢极欲，没有丝毫的痕迹。斯特里克兰把占据了一张椅子的衣服扔到了地上，我坐到了椅子上。

“我能为你效劳吗？”他问道。

在这间狭小的房子里，他似乎比我记忆中的斯特里克兰还要高大。他穿了件旧的诺福克夹克，好几天没修边幅了。我上次见他时，他的衣着起码还够整洁，但看上去挺拘谨；现在，穿得邋里邋遢，看上去却特别休闲随意。我不知道他听了我早已打好腹稿的话会作何反应。

“我受你妻子之托前来看你。”

“我正打算在晚饭之前出去喝一杯呢，你最好也跟我一起来，你喜欢喝苦艾酒吗？”

“我能喝一点儿。”

“那就走吧。”

他戴上了一顶圆顶礼帽，这帽子也急需刷洗了。

“我们可以吃晚饭，你知道，你还欠我一顿晚饭呢。”

“当然了，你是一个人吗？”

我暗自得意，我把这个最重要的问题自自然然地提出来了。

“哦，没错，事实上，我已经有三天都没跟人说过话了。我的法语也不是特别灵光。”

我在他的前面走下楼梯，暗自思忖那位茶社里的年轻姑娘出了什么状况，他们吵架了吗？或者他的热乎劲已经过去了？就目前的情景来看，他处心积虑地准备了一年，然后不顾一切地一猛子扎到巴黎来，似乎不太可能呀。我们步行到克里舍林荫大道，然后在一家大咖啡馆外的人行道上拣了张桌子坐下来。





第十二章


在这个钟点儿，克里舍林荫大道已经人满为患了。只需要发挥一点儿想象力，就能够在过往行人中发现不少庸俗小说中的人物。有职员，有女店员，有从巴尔扎克[29]书中走出来的老家伙们；还有各行各业的成员，无论男女，他们在利用人性的弱点牟利。在巴黎比较穷困的地区，大街上熙熙攘攘，充满活力，让人血脉贲张，却也准备了斯特里克兰这么一个出人意料的人物。

“你对巴黎很熟吗？”我问道。

“不熟，我们度蜜月时来过，从那以后就再也没来过。”

“你究竟怎么找到你住的这家旅馆的？”

“别人给我推荐的，我想找家便宜的旅馆。”

苦艾酒端上来了，我们故作庄重地把水滴到正在溶化的糖上。

“我想我最好马上就告诉你我来见你的原因。”我多少还是带些窘态地说。

他的眼睛眨了眨。

“我知道迟早有人会来的，我收到了艾米的很多来信。”

“那你一定很清楚地知道我要说什么了。”

“我没读那些信。”

我点上一支烟，让自己有时间考虑一下。我现在真的不知道如何来完成自己的使命了。我事先安排好的一套雄辩的说辞，哀婉的也罢，愤激的也罢，似乎在克里舍林荫大道有点不合时宜了。突然，斯特里克兰咯咯笑了起来。

“这可是件苦差事，不是吗？”

“哦，我不知道。”我回答道。

“嗯，听我说，你干脆竹筒倒豆子都说出来吧，然后，我们好好玩一个晚上。”

我迟疑不决。

“你脑子里闪过这样的念头没有，你妻子现在痛苦极了？”

“她会挺过去的。”

我简直无法形容他说这话时罕见的冷酷无情。他的回答让我语塞和不安，不过我尽量不表现出来。我采用了我的叔叔亨利——一位牧师，每次在他为候补副牧师协会向亲戚们募捐时，都会用的口吻说道。

“你不介意我实话实说吧？”

他笑着摇了摇头。

“你这样对待她，良心上过得去吗？”

“过不去。”

“你对她有什么不满意的地方吗？”

“根本没有。”

“那么，经过了十七年的婚姻生活，你又没发现她有任何错误，你就这样把她抛弃，岂不是太过分啦？”

“是很过分。”

我吃惊地瞥了他一眼。我说的话他全都认账，好像釜底抽薪，让我所处的形势复杂起来，且不说变得荒唐可笑了。我原来准备晓之以理，动之以情，循循善诱，连唬带吓，规劝告诫；如果需要的话，甚至破口责骂，大发脾气，冷嘲热讽。但是如果罪人对他所犯罪恶供认不讳，忏悔无误，接受祷告的牧师还有什么可说的，还有什么可做的呢？我对他这种人毫无经验，我自己的人生阅历好像与当下的情景格格不入。

“还有什么话要说吗？”斯特里克兰问道。

我设法动了动嘴皮子。

“好吧，如果你承认了，似乎就没有什么可多说的了。”

“我想也没有了。”

我觉得我执行这差事的策略不太高明，我显然有点窝火。

“别的都不说了，你总不能一分钱不留，就把你的妻子甩了呀。”

“为什么不能？”

“那她靠什么过日子呀？”

“我已经供养她十七年了，为什么她就不能自己养活自己，做个改变呢？”

“她做不到嘛。”

“那就让她试试。”

当然，我还有很多话可以应对。我可以说说女人的经济地位，男人如果接受了婚姻，他就必须履行的责任和义务，无论这种契约是公开的还是默认的，以及其他的很多话，但我觉得只有一点才是真正有意义的。

“你不再爱她了吗？”

“一点儿也不爱了。”他回答道。

这件事对所有的相关方都非常严重，但是他回答问题的态度却是轻松愉快、厚颜无耻的，我只得咬紧嘴唇，不让自己笑出来。我提醒自己他的所作所为是令人厌恶的，我努力激起自己出于道德上的义愤。

“他妈的，你总得为你的孩子想想。他们从未伤害过你，他们并没有要求你把他们带到这个世界上来。如果你把一切都扔下不管的话，他们只好流落街头了。”

“他们已经过了那么多年衣食无忧的日子了，享的福超过了大多数的孩子。再说，也有人会照顾他们的，真到了那一步，麦克安德鲁一家人会资助他们上学的费用的。”

“难道你不喜欢他们吗？他们是多么可爱的孩子呀，你的意思是说，你不再想和他们有任何的瓜葛了吗？”

“当他们还是小孩子的时候，我很喜欢他们，但是现在他们已经长大了，我对他们就没什么特殊的感情了。”

“你真没有人性。”

“我说也是。”

“你似乎没有一丁点儿的羞愧。”

“我没有。”

我试图再换一种方式。

“每个人都会说你是个猪狗不如的家伙。”

“让他们去说吧。”

“你难道就不怕大家在背后戳你的脊梁骨？”

“不怕。”

他简短的回答充满了傲慢，使我的问题，尽管是自然而然的，却听起来很荒谬。我反思了一两分钟。

“我很好奇如果一个人明知道别人都在非议他，他还能心安理得地生活下去？你确定这些闲话不会让你开始觉得担忧吗？人人都会有某种良知，迟早你也会良心发现的，假如你的妻子死了，你的内心不会受到悔恨的折磨吗？”

他没有回答，我等了一会儿，希望他能开口。最终还是我自己打破了沉默。

“你还有什么要说的吗？”

“我要说的只有一句，你是个该死的傻瓜。”

“不管怎样，大家会迫使你抚养妻儿的。”我反唇相讥，多少有点恼羞成怒了，“我料想法律也会为他们提供保护的。”

“法律能在石头里榨出油来吗？我没有钱，我只有大约一百镑了。”

我开始比来之前更摸不着头脑了，从他所住的旅馆上看，他目前窘迫的境地倒是不假。

“当你花光了这点钱，你打算怎么办？”

“再去挣点儿。”

他相当冷静，他的眼角一直保持着嘲讽的微笑，使我说的全部话好像很愚蠢。我停顿了一会儿，考虑我下面最好再说些什么。但这次他却先开口了。

“艾米为什么不可以再嫁人呢？相对来说，她的年龄还算年轻，长得也不错。我可以肯定地说，她是个优秀的妻子，如果她想跟我离婚，我不会介意给她提供必要的借口。”

此时轮到我微笑了，他很狡猾，但最终狐狸的尾巴还是露了出来，这才是他的目的所在。出于某种原因，他必须把他和一个女人已经私奔的事实掩盖起来，而且千方百计地把她藏在了某处。我斩钉截铁地说：

“你的妻子说了，无论你用什么样的手段都不能诱使她同你离婚，她已经下定决心了。你还是彻底死了这条心吧。”

他大吃一惊地看着我，这表情显然不是装出来的。他嘴角的微笑消失了，十分严肃地说道：

“可是，我亲爱的朋友，我不会在意的。她同意离婚还是不同意离婚，跟我没有一点儿关系了。”

我笑了起来。

“哦，算了吧，你没有必要把我们当傻子。我们碰巧知道你和一个女人私奔了。”

他愣了一下，然后突然爆发出一阵大笑。

他的笑声如此放肆，引来了坐在我们周围人的目光，有些人也跟着笑了起来。

“我没看出来这事有什么好笑的。”

“可怜的艾米。”他笑容未消地说。

随后，他的脸变成一副不屑和鄙夷的样子。

“女人就是头发长见识短，可怜的脑袋瓜里只容得下一件事：爱情！永远是爱情。她们认为男人离开她们只是因为他想要别的女人。你认为我是这样的傻瓜吗，会因为另外一个女人而重蹈覆辙？”

“你的意思是，你不是因为另外一个女人而抛弃你的妻子？”

“当然。”

“你敢发誓吗？”

我不知道为什么我会这样要求他，这话说得太没水平了。

“我发誓。”

“那么，看在上帝的分上，你究竟为什么离开她？”

“我想画画。”

我盯着他看了好长时间。我搞不明白，我想他是疯了。别忘了我那时还很年轻，在我眼里，他是一个中年人，我除了目瞪口呆外，什么也记不得了。

“但是你都四十岁了。”

“我想到的是，这正是开始画画的好时候。”

“你以前画过画吗？”

“在小时候，我特别想成为一名画家，但我的父亲让我学做生意，他说学艺术挣不着钱。一年前，我开始画了一些画，在过去的一年中，我一直坚持去夜校学习画画。”

“斯特里克兰太太认为你在俱乐部玩桥牌的时候，你实际上是去了那里？”

“是的，就是这么回事。”

“那你为什么不跟她说实话？”

“我希望有点自己个人的空间。”

“你现在会画了吗？”

“还不太会，但我一定会的。这就是我来这儿的原因。我在伦敦无法得到我想要的，也许在这儿可以。”

“你认为像你这个年龄学画画还能学出来吗？大多数人在十八岁就开始学画了。”

“我要是十八岁时开始学，会比现在学得快些。”

“究竟是什么使你认为你有这方面的天赋呢？”

他没有马上回答，他的目光落在了过往的人群上，但我觉得他并没真正在看。过了一会儿，他答非所问地说道：

“我必须要画画。”

“你这岂不是在撞大运吗？”

这时他看着我，眼中有种奇怪的东西，让我感到很不舒服。

“你多大了？二十三？”

这个问题在我看来有点跑题，很自然我应该有时间抓住生活中的种种机遇。但是他是个青春已逝的男人，是有了受人尊敬地位的证券经纪人，有了妻子和两个孩子的中年男人了，对我来说可能是很自然的道路，对他来说就很荒诞了。我希望我能表现得公平些。

“当然奇迹也许会发生，你可能会成为一个伟大的画家。但是你必须承认这样的机会只有百万分之一。如果到头来，你不得不承认你把事情弄得一团糟，后悔可就来不及了。”

“我必须要画画。”他又重复了一遍。

“如果你至多只能成为三流画家，你觉得放弃现有的这一切值得吗？毕竟，如果你从事别的什么行业，做得不够好也无关紧要，只要你衣食无忧，就会过得很舒服。但是，如果做个艺术家那就另当别论了。”

“你这个该死的傻瓜。”他说。

“我看不出来你为什么说我傻，除非我傻在说出了显而易见的真相。”

“我告诉你我必须要画画，我自己控制不了自己，一个人落到水里，他如何游泳，姿势好看难看根本没有关系，他必须挣扎出水，否则就会被淹死。”

在他的声音中，能听出某种激情，我不由自主地被感动了，似乎能够感觉到在他的身体里有种激昂的力量在斗争，能够感觉到某种东西非常强大，压倒一切，紧紧地把控着他，违背他的意愿。我无法理解，他真的好像被魔鬼附了体。我觉得魔鬼会突然转过身撕碎了他。但是，他看上去再普通不过了，我的眼睛好奇地打量他，但没有让他感到尴尬。我想知道一个陌生人会怎么看待他：穿着破旧的诺福克夹克和戴着脏兮兮的圆顶礼帽坐在那儿；他的裤子肥大而皱皱巴巴，两只手也不干净；没有修边幅的下巴上都是红色的胡茬，小眼睛，大鼻子咄咄逼人，面容既粗野又粗糙。他的嘴很大，嘴唇很厚，很性感。不行，我无法给他定位。

“你不会回到你妻子身边了吗？”我最后又问道。

“绝不。”

“她愿意忘了所发生的一切，重新开始，她决不会责怪你半句的。”

“让她见鬼去吧。”

“如果人们认为你是个十足的无赖你不会在意吗？如果你的妻儿不得不去沿街乞讨，你也不会在意吗？”

“完全不在意。”

我沉默了片刻，为了让我的下一句话更加有分量，我尽可能一字一顿地说。

“你是个天底下最卑鄙的男人。”

“既然你已经把压在心头的话都倒了出来，那么让我们一起去吃晚餐吧。”





第十三章


我敢说要是拒绝这个建议会是更合乎情理的。我觉得也许我本应表现出愤怒的姿态来，我也确实感到愤怒。我能肯定，如果我向麦克安德鲁上校报告说，我严词拒绝和斯特里克兰这样的人坐在同一张桌子前吃饭，起码上校会高看我几眼的。但是，害怕不能把这种义正词严有效地实施下去，而且这种担心总是让我羞于故作大义凛然之态。我也深知，我的各种情绪对于斯特里克兰肯定不会有丝毫的影响，这样尤其使我不好意思再说什么了。只有诗人和圣人才会在柏油路上浇水，满怀信心地期望能长出百合花来回报他们的辛劳。

我付了我们喝咖啡的钱，同他向一家便宜的餐馆走去。餐馆拥挤而热闹，在这儿我们吃得很开心。我俩的胃口都很好，我是因为年轻，他是因为没心没肺。随后我们去了一家酒馆喝咖啡和甜酒。

这次巴黎之行的使命，我该说的话已经全都说了。虽然我觉得我不再坚持下去，对斯特里克兰太太来说多少有些背叛之嫌，但我面对斯特里克兰的冷漠只能缴械投降。这个使命要求有女性的性格，同样的事情要热情不减地重复三遍。聊以自慰的是，搞清楚了斯特里克兰葫芦里到底卖的什么药，对我来说也是有用的。而他所想的这件事让我也更感兴趣。但要搞清楚这一点也并非易事，因为斯特里克兰不是一个能说会道的人，他表达自己的想法似乎有些困难，好像言辞不是阐释他思想活动的媒介一样。你只能通过老套的词句、俚语和模糊、不完整的手势去猜测他的想法和意图。然而，虽然他说不出什么有意义的话，但是在他的个性上有某种东西，让人感觉他绝非一个平淡乏味之人，也许这就是他的真诚。虽说他是第一次来巴黎（我没算他和他妻子度蜜月来的那次），但他对巴黎的一切似乎根本没放在眼里，有些景象一定让他觉得新奇，但他坦然接受，一点也不吃惊。我来巴黎已经一百次了，但每一次来都兴奋和激动，每次走在巴黎的大街上都会感觉行走在冒险的边缘。而斯特里克兰却能保持平常心。现在回想这件事，我认为除了某种能让他灵魂不安的景象，他对一切都视而不见。

后来又发生了一件很荒唐的事。在酒馆里有很多妓女，有些和男人们坐在一起，另外一些自己待着。我们进去没多久，我就注意到有个妓女正在瞟着我们。当她和斯特里克兰目光相遇时，她向斯特里克兰做了个笑脸，而我认为斯特里克兰根本没注意她。过了一会儿，她出去了，但没多久又回来了，在路过我们桌子时，很礼貌地请我们给她买点什么喝的。她坐了下来，我开始跟她聊天，但显而易见她的兴趣在斯特里克兰身上。我跟她解释说，斯特里克兰的法语也就会几个词。她试图和他交谈，一半比画，一半用混杂的法语，不知什么原因，她觉得这样斯特里克兰会更容易懂，有时还用上几个英语中的词句。只能用她自己的话表达时，她就让我翻译给斯特里克兰听，急切地问我斯特里克兰的回答是什么意思。斯特里克兰的脾气很好，也有一些兴致，但他的冷漠也显而易见。

“我想你把她征服了。”我笑着说。

“我并不感到得意。”

要是换了我，我会感到有些尴尬，不会那么平静。她有一双含笑的眼睛和迷人的嘴唇，很年轻。我很好奇她在斯特里克兰身上发现了什么吸引她的东西。她一点儿也不避讳她的想法，让我如实地翻译过去。

“她想让你跟她一起回家。”

“我不会招惹任何女人。”他答道。

我把他的回答尽量翻得不那么生硬。我好像都觉得拒绝这种邀请实在有些不太礼貌。于是我向她解释，他拒绝的原因是因为他兜里没钱。

“但是我喜欢他，”她说，“告诉他我是因为爱。”

当我把这话翻译给斯特里克兰听的时候，他不耐烦地耸了耸肩。

“告诉她滚一边去。”他说。

他的态度让他的回答意思很清楚了，那个女孩突然把头往后一甩。也许她化了妆的脸也红了一下。她站起身来。

“这位先生太不懂礼貌了。[30]”

她走出了小酒馆。我也有几分恼火。

“我看你没有必要侮辱她吧，”我说，“毕竟，她这样做是看得起你呀。”

“这种货色让我恶心。”他没好气地说。

我好奇地看着他，在他的脸上真出现了厌恶的表情，但是这张脸终究是一个粗野和肉欲男人的脸，我猜想这个女孩就是被这张脸上的粗野劲儿吸引过去的。

“我可以把伦敦所有我想要的女人都搞到手，我来这儿可不是为了这个。”





第十四章


在我回伦敦的路上，脑袋里都是斯特里克兰的形象。我试图把要向斯特里克兰太太汇报的情况按顺序捋了一遍。情况并不令人满意，我也无法想象她能对我满意，因为我自己对自己都不能满意。斯特里克兰令我困扰，我不能理解他的动机。当我问他最初究竟是什么让他有了当画家的想法，他不能或不愿告诉我，我自己也猜不出。我想说服自己，也许是在他迟钝的大脑里，逐渐萌生了模模糊糊的反叛的想法，但有一点又说不通的是，事实上他从未表现出对他单调的生活不耐烦。假如他被无法忍受的无聊所控制，从而决定要当个画家，仅仅以此摆脱种种令人厌烦的纽带，这还好理解，也符合常识。但是确切地说，我认为符合常识这一点恰恰是他身上所没有的。最后，因为我是比较罗曼蒂克的，我想出了一种解释，尽管这种解释我自己也觉得有点牵强，但还算是唯一能让我满意的。这个解释是这样的：我自问是不是在他灵魂深处有某种根深蒂固的创作本能，他生活的环境把这种本能掩盖了，让人看不清楚。但是它持续不断地顽强生长，就像生命组织中癌细胞的生长，直到最后它占据了他的整个生命机体，迫使他不可遏止地采取行动。如同杜鹃鸟把蛋下到其他鸟的巢中，当孵出雏鸟后，杜鹃的雏鸟会把异母兄弟们用肩膀挤出鸟巢，最后把为它遮风避雨的鸟巢也破坏殆尽。

但是创作的本能攫住了这个乏味的证券经纪人，这是件多么匪夷所思的事啊，它会导致他自身的毁灭，也许也会导致依靠他生活的人的不幸。不过，相比于上帝之精神对人的控制，倒也说不上多么的大惊小怪。上帝对那些权高位重、家财万贯的人以不懈的警觉去追踪他们，最后征服他们，促使他们放弃世俗的欢愉和对女人的贪爱，甘心到寺庙中过凄苦冷清的苦行僧的生活。皈依可以任何形态出现，也可以通过多种方式实现。有些人需要突然降临的巨变，就像岩石被咆哮的激流冲击成碎片；但有些需要渐变，就像岩石被永不停歇的滴水慢慢磨平。斯特里克兰有着狂热者的直截了当和使徒的狂热不羁。

但是，我的思想是讲求实际的，一切还需拭目以待。斯特里克兰所执着的这股激情还需用作品来检验。当我问他，他在伦敦夜校的同学如何评价他的绘画时，他笑着回答说。

“他们认为它是个笑话。”

“在这儿，你已经开始在哪家画室正式学习了吗？”

“是的，有个无耻的家伙今天上午还来过我这儿——我说的是那个老师，你知道，当他看见我的画作后，仅仅扬了扬眉毛就走掉了。”

斯特里克兰咯咯笑了起来。他似乎没有感到沮丧，同行的意见对他毫无影响。

在我和他打交道的过程中，最让人头疼的就是这一点。当有人说他们不在乎别人怎么看他们的时候，大部分人是在自欺欺人。一般来说，他们的意思只是想随心所欲，我行我素，私下以为没人会懂他们的异想天开。最极端的情况下，他们只是得到了几个身旁人的支持，就愿意去干冒天下之大不韪的事情。如果一个人的反传统就是他这个圈子的常规的话，被世人看作是异端也没有什么了不起。相反，他还可以扬扬自得，可以有标榜自我满足的勇气，而不必冒什么风险。但是，获得认可的想法可能是受了教化之人最根深蒂固的愿望了。正如一个反传统的女人，当她暴露在违反习俗礼规后的唇枪舌剑之下，没有谁能像她跑得那样快去寻求体面尊严作为她的盾牌。我绝不相信有人告诉我，他们不在乎同行的意见。他们真正的意思是，他们只是不怕别人对他们小过失的责难，而这些小过失他们原以为没人会发现。

让人大跌眼镜的是，这儿还真有这么一个真心不介意人们怎么看待他的人。因此，常规的习俗拿他毫无办法。他就像一个浑身涂满了油的拳击手，你根本没法抓住他。这就给了他一种自由，而让别人火冒三丈。我记得我跟他说：

“你听我说，如果每个人都像你那样做事，这世界岂不乱套了。”

“你说的这是什么蠢话。并非每个人都想像我一样做事，绝大多数人对于所做普通寻常事都是心满意足的。”

听到这话，我立马想挖苦他一下。

“你显然不相信这样一句格言：好人立行，行为世范。”

“我以前从未听过这样的话，但是这是一派胡言。”

“好吧，我告诉你这话是康德说的。”

“我才不在乎是谁说的，总之是一派胡言。”

对于这样一个人，你不能指望可以有效地唤起他的良知。就像没有一面镜子，你不可能照见自己的形象一样。我把良知看作是个人的卫士，用以维护社会赖以存在和演进而制定的种种规则。它是我们所有人心灵的警察，设置在那里监视我们不要违反法律，它是间谍，坐在中心堡垒的一端，刺探自我意识的活动。人们希望获得同胞们认可的愿望是如此的强烈，害怕别人舆论批评过于猛烈，以至于他自己会把敌人引进到自己的门内。于是它就会不停地监视着，总是警觉要维护主人的利益，但凡有人想不随大多数人的脚步，哪怕这种想法还在萌芽状态，它都要连根拔除。它会迫使他把社会的利益置于自己的利益之上。它是非常牢固的纽带，使个人依附于整体，人们向社会利益卑躬屈节，说服自己个人利益比它渺小得多，使自己成为良知的奴隶，他把良知置于崇高地位。最后，就像一个弄臣奉承放在他肩头的皇家权杖一样，他为自己能对良知足够敏感而自豪。随后，他会用恶毒的话语去攻击那些没有认识到良知占统治地位的人，因为现在作为社会的一分子，他充分并确切地认识到，想要反社会，个人根本没有力量。当我看到斯特里克兰对他的行为肯定会引起的斥责真的无动于衷的时候，我只好战战兢兢地退缩回来，好像被一个非人形的怪物吓破了胆。

当我和他道晚安时，他对我说了最后几句话：

“告诉艾米，老缠着我是没有用的。我要换旅馆了，所以她找不到我了。”

“以我个人的印象，好像是她要摆脱你。”我说。

“我亲爱的伙计，我只希望你能使她看清这一点。但是女人都很蠢。”





第十五章


当我到达伦敦的时候，发现有一封急件在等着我，要求我在晚饭后尽可能早地去斯特里克兰太太家一趟。等我到了她家，我发现她和麦克安德鲁上校及他的妻子在一起。斯特里克兰太太的姐姐比她大得多，姐俩长得很像，但她姐姐显老得多。这个女人摆出一副精明能干的样子，仿佛整个大英帝国都在她的囊中。高级军官的太太们都自认为属于上流阶层。她仪态万方，但良好的教养也无法掩饰她的偏见，如果你不是个军人的话，你可能就是个站柜台的小商贩。她讨厌近卫军军官，认为他们盛气凌人，她不屑于谈论他们的太太，认为她们出身低微。她的衣服样式古板，但价格不菲。

斯特里克兰太太看上去很紧张。

“好吧，把你的消息跟我们说说吧。”她说。

“我见到你丈夫了，恐怕他已经下定决心不回来了。”我停顿了一会儿，“他想画画。”

“你说什么？”斯特里克兰太太喊道，惊得目瞪口呆。

“你一点儿也不知道他对画画很上心吗？”

“他一定是疯了。”上校嚷嚷道。

斯特里克兰太太眉头紧锁了一小会儿，她在记忆中努力寻找着蛛丝马迹。

“我记得在结婚前，他常常带着一个颜料盒，四下闲逛。但你可能从未见过那种涂鸦，要多难看有多难看，我们经常打趣他，他绝对没有那方面的天赋。”

“当然了，那只是一个借口。”麦克安德鲁太太说。

斯特里克兰太太陷入了沉思，很显然，她对我说的一切理不清头绪。现在她已经把客厅收拾得差不多了，她天生的主妇本能使她从又惊又气中恢复了过来。客厅不再是冷冷清清的样子，像是一个带家具的房子很长时间等着出租——当灾难降临之后，我第一次登门时注意到客厅给人的感觉。但是，现在我在巴黎和斯特里克兰见过面，我很难想象他曾在这样的环境中生活过。我认为几乎无法让他们认识到，实际上在斯特里克兰身上有种异于常人的东西。

“但是，如果他想成为一名艺术家，他为什么不直接说出来？”最后，斯特里克兰太太问道，“我想我绝不会不支持他这种——这种志向的。”

麦克安德鲁太太咬紧嘴唇。我能想象她从不看好她妹妹同文人们结交，她说到“文艺”时，总带有嘲弄的口吻。

斯特里克兰太太继续说道：

“毕竟，如果他有任何天赋，我肯定是第一个鼓励他的。我不介意做出牺牲。我更愿意嫁给一个画家，而不是一个证券经纪人。如果不是为了孩子们，我一切都不会计较，我会很开心地住在切尔西一个破旧的画室里，就像我住在这所房子里一样开心。”

“亲爱的，我没有耐心听你说下去了，”麦克安德鲁太太喊道，“你不会想说，对这派胡言，你信以为真了吧？”

“但我认为这是真的。”我淡淡地插话说。

她又好气又好笑地看着我。

“一个正常的男人不会在他四十岁的年纪丢掉生意，抛弃他妻子和孩子，想成为一名画家的，除非有个女人搅和在里面。我料想他遇见了一个你的——艺术家朋友，是她给他洗了脑。”

在斯特里克兰太太苍白的两颊突然出现了一抹红晕。

“那女的长得什么样？”

我迟疑了一下，我知道我给他们准备了一颗重磅炸弹。

“根本没有什么女人。”

麦克安德鲁上校和他的妻子不约而同地表示这难以置信，而斯特里克兰太太一下子跳了起来。

“你的意思是说你根本没见到她？”

“没人可见呀，他只是一个人。”

“那是不符合情理的。”麦克安德鲁太太喊道。

“我就知道应该自己亲自去的，”上校说，“我敢跟你们打赌，我会尽快把那个女人找出来的。”

“我真希望你自己过去，”我用尖刻的口吻回答道，“你会看见你的每一个假设都是站不住脚的，他并没有住在一个豪华的旅馆，他住在一个极其寒酸的小房间里。他离开家绝不是为了过上花天酒地的生活，他手上几乎没有什么钱了。”

“你认为他会不会做了什么我们不知道的事情，因为怕警察找上门，而躲起来避风头？”

这一暗示使所有人心中燃起了一丝希望，但我认为这是无中生有。

“如果真是这样，他不会蠢到给他的合伙人留地址，”我尖酸地反驳道，“不管怎么说，有一件事我敢肯定，他没有跟任何人私奔，他没有恋爱，他的脑子里根本没这种东西。”

当他们在考虑我说的话时，又是好一阵沉寂。

“好吧，如果你说的是真的，”最后麦克安德鲁太太说，“事情还不像我想的那样糟。”

斯特里克兰太太瞥了我一眼，但什么话也没说。她脸色现在非常苍白，她好看的额头发暗，向下低垂着。我看不出她脸上的表情，麦克安德鲁太太继续说道：

“如果仅仅是一时的异想天开，他会回来的。”

“你干吗不去找他呀，艾米？”上校试着说，“你完全可以和他在巴黎住上一年呀，我们来照看孩子们，我敢说他很快就会厌倦的，迟早他会主动回到伦敦来的，一场风波就会过去了。”

“换了我，我就不会这么做。”麦克安德鲁太太说，“我会把他想要的绳子放得长长的，到时候他就会夹着尾巴乖乖地回来，舒舒服服地再次安顿下来。”麦克安德鲁太太冷冷地看着她的妹妹，“和他一起生活时，也许有时你太不明智了，男人们都是奇怪的动物，女人必须学会如何管控他们。”

麦克安德鲁太太和其他的女人一样，抱有相同的看法，男人都是畜生，总想抛弃依恋他们的女人，但是如果他真这样做了，女人更难辞其咎。感情不能被理智所理解是有理由的。[31]

斯特里克兰太太的目光慢慢地从一个人身上转到另一个人身上。

“他再也不会回来了。”她说。

“哦，亲爱的，记着我们刚才说的话，他过去舒服惯了，有人照料他的起居，在他厌倦了在一个肮脏旅馆住在一个肮脏房间之后，你认为他还能坚持多久？另外，他也没有钱了，他不得不回来。”

“原来我觉得只要他是和某个女人跑了，就还有一线希望。我认为这种事情不会有结果，不出三个月他就会对那个女人烦得要死，但如果他的离家不是因为爱上了某人，那就完了。”

“哦，我认为你说得太‘玄乎’了。”上校说道，他用这个词来表示他的不屑，如果他觉得有什么东西和职业传统格格不入的话，他一律冠以“玄乎”一词。“你别信这个，他会回来的，就像多萝西[32]所说的，我敢说让他在外面放纵一阵子，也不会糟到哪里去的。”

“但是我不想让他回来了。”她说。

“艾米！”

愤怒攫住了斯特里克兰太太的心，一阵心头发凉的、突然的怒气让她的脸色变为惨白。她说得很快，几乎没有喘息的机会。

“如果他死心塌地地爱上某个女人，而且和她私奔，我都可以原谅。我想这很自然，我不会真的责怪他。我会想他是被人勾搭走的。男人们是那么软弱，女人们是那么无耻。但是，现在情况不同了，我恨他，我现在绝不会原谅他了。”

麦克安德鲁上校和他的妻子开始一起劝说她，他们感到很吃惊，告诉她说她疯了。他们无法理解她的想法。斯特里克兰太太绝望地转向我说：

“你难道不明白我的意思吗？”她哭喊道。

“我不能确定。你的意思是说，如果他为了一个女人离开你，你可以原谅他，但如果他为了一个理想离开你，你就不能原谅了。因为你觉得你和前者可以势均力敌，而对于后者，你就无能为力了，是吗？”

斯特里克兰太太幽怨地看了我一眼，没有作答。也许我的话切中要害。她继续用低沉和颤抖的声音说道：

“我从未想到我可能像恨他一样恨过一个人呢。你知道，我一直安慰我自己，无论这事持续多久，最终他是想要我的。我知道如果他不久于人世，他会派人来找我，我也马上会去；我会像母亲一样照顾他，直到最后一刻，我会告诉他没关系的，我永远爱着他，我会原谅他所做的一切。”

我总是受不了一个充满激情的女人在她所爱的人弥留之际表现出的宽宏大量的样子。有时好像她们不愿意爱人们的寿命太长，以免耽误她们演出一场绝妙好戏的机会。

“但是现在—现在一切都完了。我现在对他，就像对一个陌路人一样没有丝毫感情了。我想让他在悲惨、贫困和饥饿中死去，死时身边没有一个朋友。我希望他身患肮脏的疾病慢慢烂掉。我和他的关系算是彻底完了。”

我想不妨趁这个机会把斯特里克兰的建议说出来。

“如果你想跟他离婚，他非常愿意配合你，使其成为可能。”

“我为什么要给他自由？”

“我想他并不想要什么自由，他只是想离婚可能对你更方便些。”

斯特里克兰太太不耐烦地耸了耸肩。我觉得我对她有点失望。我那时对人性的期望比现在要高，当我发现在如此迷人的女人身上竟然有这么强烈的报复心时，我沮丧透了，我还没认识到人性中各种品性如此地混杂。现在我完全明白了，卑鄙和崇高、恶毒和慈悲、憎恶和喜爱能够在同一个人心中并行不悖。

我不知道还能说些什么，如果能减轻此时此刻正折磨斯特里克兰太太的屈辱感，我想我一定会想方设法去尝试的。

“你知道，我不能肯定你丈夫对自己的行为是否能够完全负责任，我认为他已经不是原来的他了，他好像被某种力量所控制了，这种力量正利用他来完成自己的目标，在它的掌控中，他很无助，就像在蜘蛛网中的一只苍蝇。好像有人给他施加了魔咒。我想起了那些奇怪的故事，说一个人的灵魂进入了另一个人的身体里，把原来那个人的灵魂驱赶了出来。新的灵魂在身体里并不安分，还有能力做一些神秘的变形。要是在过去，他们会说查尔斯·斯特里克兰被魔鬼附身了。”

麦克安德鲁太太把她衣服的下摆捋直，金镯子滑落到了手腕上。

“你说的这些话对我来说太离奇了点儿，”她尖酸地说，“我不否认，也许艾米对她丈夫有点太放任了。如果她不是那么忙于自己的事情，我无法相信她不会怀疑到事情有些异样。我认为如果阿列克[33]心里藏着什么事儿，不出一年多，我保准儿能察觉出来。”

上校茫然四顾，我很好奇，这世上还有没有人像他那样看上去那么纯真，却好像受了不白之冤。

“但是不可否认的是，查尔斯·斯特里克兰就是个没心没肺的畜生。”她严肃地看着我说，“我可以告诉你为什么他抛弃了他的妻子——纯粹是因为自私，再也找不出其他原因了。”

“那肯定是最简单的解释了。”我说，但我想这种解释等于什么都没解释。最后，我站起身来，说我累了，准备要走，斯特里克兰太太没做任何挽留。





第十六章


接下来发生的事表明斯特里克兰太太是个很有个性的女人，她把所遭受的痛苦隐藏得不露痕迹。她很精明地看到，对于不幸如果没完没了地说个没完，别人很快就会觉得乏味厌烦，因为任何人都会主动回避所看见的愁苦。每当她出门——因为同情她的不幸，她的朋友们都会急切地安慰她——她的行为举止总是无可挑剔。她很有勇气，但不刻意表现；快乐，但不显得肆无忌惮；她似乎更加焦虑地听别人诉说烦恼，而不是讨论她自己的不幸。每当说起她丈夫的时候，她总是带着同情的口吻。一开始的时候，她对他的这种态度让我很困惑，有一天她对我说：

“你知道，你跟我说查尔斯是一个人在巴黎，我敢肯定你弄错了。从我所得到的某些消息上看——虽然我不能把消息的来源告诉你——我确信他不是一个人离开英格兰的。”

“要是那样的话，他确实很有天分来隐藏他的行踪。”

她把目光避开了我，脸色有点红。

“我的意思是，如果有人跟你谈起这事，如果他们说他和某个人私奔了，请你别否认这种说法。”

“当然我不会否认。”

她改变了话题，好像这是件对她无关紧要的事情。不久我就发现，在她的朋友中间流传着一个特别的故事。他们说查尔斯·斯特里克兰迷上了一位法国女舞蹈家，他是在帝国大剧院看芭蕾舞时，第一次见到她，后来就陪着她一起去了巴黎。我不知道这种说法从何而来，但匪夷所思的是，斯特里克兰太太由此赚取了人们的同情，与此同时，还赢得了很多声望。这为她决定今后要从事的行业也会有些用处。麦克安德鲁上校说她已经身无分文并非夸大其词，对她来讲，尽快地独立谋生显得很必要。她已经拿定主意，可以挣她所熟悉的作家们的钱。于是立马开始学习速记和打字。作为一个打字员，她的教育背景使她能够比一般人更有效率，而有关她的故事使她能够招揽来更多的生意。她的朋友们承诺把他们的作品送到她这儿来，而且还关照她的生意，把他们的朋友也推荐给她。

麦克安德鲁一家没有孩子，家境也好，便承担起了抚养孩子们的责任，而斯特里克兰太太只需自给自足就够了。她把房子出租，家具也卖了，在威斯敏斯特的两个小房间里安顿了下来，开始面对崭新的世界。她的办事效率很高，这就保证了她的生意注定会成功。





第十七章


这件事大约过去五年之后，我决定去巴黎住一段时间。我在伦敦住腻了，对日复一日地做同样的事情烦透了。我的朋友们波澜不惊地追求着事业，他们不再带给我惊喜，当我遇见他们的时候，我都能知道他们会说些什么，甚至他们的绯闻都乏善可陈。我们就像有轨电车，沿着轨道从一站驶向另一站，甚至都能数得清所运载的乘客数目。生活被安排得太井井有条，太一成不变了，而我却感到恐慌。我退掉了我的小公寓，卖掉了几件物品，决定开始新的生活。

在离开前，我登门拜访了斯特里克兰太太。我有段时间没见她了，我注意到她身上的变化。她不仅老了，瘦了，皱纹也多了，而且我觉得她连性情都变了。她的生意做得有声有色，现在昌赛利巷有了一间铺面，她自己很少打字了，时间主要花在校对她雇佣的四个女孩所打出的成品上。她想把打字稿弄得精致些，很多地方利用了蓝和红两种色系，她把稿件用浅色的粗纸装订起来，乍看上去隐约像有水印的丝绸。她给人打的稿件以整齐和准确而名声在外。她挣了些钱，但总觉得自己糊口谋生有失身份，在别人面前抬不起头来，所以常常不忘提醒你，她实际上是大家闺秀出身。她在谈话中总忍不住带出她所认识的名人的名字，让你知道她的社会地位并没有降低。她有点耻于谈论做生意的勇气和能力，但会开心地表示，第二天晚上她会和住在南肯辛顿的某位王室法律顾问一起共用晚餐。她很高兴地告诉你她的儿子在剑桥大学读书，伴随着笑声，她会提到她女儿刚刚被邀请参加舞会，而且各种各样的舞会应接不暇。我想我说了句不动脑子的话。

“她会接管你的生意吗？”我问。

“哦，不会，我是不会让她干这行的。”斯特里克兰太太回答道，“她长得那么漂亮，我敢肯定她会嫁个好人家的。”

“我早该想到的，女儿嫁个金龟婿对你会大有帮助。”

“好几个人都说她应该登台表演，但是我当然不会同意，我认识所有的著名戏剧家，如果我愿意，明天就能帮她弄到个角色，但是我不喜欢她和三教九流的人混在一起。”

斯特里克兰太太这种孤芳自赏的态度让我有点齿冷。

“你后来有你丈夫的消息吗？”

“没有，我一个字也没听说，也许已经死了也未可知。”

“我在巴黎可能会碰到他，你愿意让我替你去了解一下他的情况吗？”

她犹豫了一会儿。

“如果他真的很困难，我倒是准备给他点儿帮助。我会给你一笔钱，当他需要的时候，你可以逐步给他。”

“你真是太好了。”我说道。

但是我知道她提供帮助并不是出于菩萨心肠。有人说遭受苦难能使人性高贵，这话不对，有时幸福倒是可以，但是遭受苦难，对于大多数人来讲，只会使人变得心胸狭隘，报复心强。





第十八章


事实上，我到巴黎十四天后，就遇到了斯特里克兰。

我很快就在达姆路一所房子的五层楼上租到一小间公寓，然后又花几百法郎在二手货市场买了足够的家具，使房间满足了居住的需要。我安排门房每天早上帮我煮咖啡，这样可以保证房间的整洁。安顿下来之后，我就去拜访我的老朋友迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫。

迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫是这样一个人，根据人们的不同性格特点，人们会对他做出不同的判断，有的人会鄙夷地一笑，有的人会尴尬地耸耸肩。造化把他塑造成一个滑稽人物。他是个画家，但是很蹩脚，我在罗马结识的他，他的那些画我至今还记得。他真的甘于平庸，而且乐此不疲。他的灵魂因为热爱艺术而悸动，他描摹悬挂在斯巴格纳广场上贝尼尼[34]式建筑楼梯两旁的画作，一点儿也不怕别人说描摹得明显失真。他的画室里满是各种画布，有的画着头戴尖顶帽、蓄着小胡须、大眼睛的农民群像；有的画着衣服破破烂烂的一群顽童；还有的画着穿鲜艳裙子的女人们。有时他们在教堂的台阶上懒洋洋地躺着，有时在万里无云碧空下的柏树林里嬉戏，有时在文艺复兴时期建筑风格的井栏边谈情说爱，还有时跟在牛车的旁边，慢慢地穿过意大利的田野。他们被仔细地勾勒，认真地上了油彩，一张照片的精确程度也不过如此。一位住在美第奇别墅中的画家把他称为“巧克力盒子画家[35]”，乍一看他的画作，你可能会认为莫奈[36]、马奈[37]以及其他印象派画家在这个世界上压根就没存在过。

“我从不冒充自己是个伟大的画家，”他说，“我不是米开朗琪罗，不，我不是，但我有自己的一套，也有人买我的画。我把浪漫带到了千家万户。你知道，他们不仅在荷兰买我的画，而且在挪威、瑞典和丹麦，都在买我的画。大多数的买家都是商人和有钱的生意人。你无法想象在这些国家，冬天漫长、黑暗和阴冷，他们喜欢我画中意大利的景象，认为意大利就跟我的画一样，也完全符合他们的想象，在我来这儿之前，我想象中的意大利也是这样的。”

我想正是这种景象老是在他的脑海中晃动，让他眼花缭乱，无法看清真实的情况。尽管事实很残酷，他一如既往地用心灵之眼看待意大利，满眼的浪漫侠盗和美丽的废墟。这就是他用他的画所描绘的理想——尽管可怜、庸俗和陈腐，但终究还是理想，这笃定无疑地赋予了他性格中一种讨人喜欢的特质。

也正是因为这一点，我觉得迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫不仅对我来说，就是对别人来说也一样，仅仅就是一个被挖苦的对象。对他的画，同行们公开蔑视，但是他能挣来大钱，所以他们也毫不犹豫、心安理得地花他的钱。他很慷慨大方，那些手头拮据的人，一方面嘲笑他竟然会幼稚地相信他们困苦的故事，一方面又厚颜无耻地向他借钱。他还多愁善感，很容易动感情，感情中有某种荒唐的东西，所以你可以接受他的好意，但绝不会感恩。从他身上弄钱就像抢劫一个孩子那样容易，你瞧不起他是因为他是个大傻帽。我试想，一个扒手，很为他的手脚麻利而沾沾自喜，可要是一个粗心的女人，竟然会把装满珠宝首饰的花哨钱包落在马车里，让他无用武之地，这会让他愤愤不平的。至于斯特罗伊夫，造化弄人把他塑造成了笑柄，一方面又没有让他变得感觉迟钝。他在各种嘲笑中饱受煎熬，实际的挖苦和善意的取笑都让他痛苦不堪，但是似乎他又很愿意给他们提供这种机会，所以对他的讽刺挖苦就从未停止过。他不断地受到伤害，可天性又是如此的善良，所以从不记恨别人。就像毒蛇咬了他一口，但他从不吸取教训，刚从伤痛中恢复过来，马上又会温柔地把毒蛇揽入怀中。他的生活是场悲剧，但是用打打闹闹的滑稽剧的形式写成的。因为我没有嘲笑过他，所以他对我感激涕零，过去可没少往我富有同情的耳朵里灌输他一长串的烦恼事。最悲惨的是，这些烦恼都是荒诞不经的，所以他讲得越悲惨，你就越忍不住想笑出声来。

然而，虽说他是个蹩脚的画家，但他对艺术的感觉还是非常细腻的，如果有机会跟他一起去画廊，你总会有不少的收获。他对艺术充满热情，而他对艺术的批评又一针见血。他信仰天主教，不仅对古典派大师的作品有真知灼见，对现代派画家的作品也有很强的鉴赏力。他能很快地发现一个天才，而且毫不吝惜他的赞誉之词。我认为在我认识的人中，再没有谁比他的判断更为准确的了。他所受到的艺术熏陶比大多数的画家都要多，他不像这些画家对同源的其他艺术那样无知，他对音乐和文学很有品位，使他对绘画有着深刻和不拘一格的领悟。对于我这样的年轻人，他的意见和指导具有旁人无法比拟的价值。

离开罗马后，我还和他保持着通信联系，每过一两个月就会收到他的长信，用奇怪的英语写成，读他的信，就好像在眼前生动地浮现出他语无伦次、热情四溢、手舞足蹈地说话的样子。在我来巴黎前的一阵子，他娶了一个英国女人，现在定居在蒙特马特尔区，我们有四年未见了，我也从未和他的妻子谋过面。





第十九章


我事先没告诉斯特罗伊夫我要到巴黎来，当我按响他画室的门铃后，他本人过来开的门，他没有马上认出我来。随后，他惊喜地喊叫起来，一把把我拉进了屋里。受到如此热切的欢迎是件很开心的事。他的妻子坐在炉子边做着针线活，当我进来时，她站起身来。斯特罗伊夫向她介绍我。

“你不记得了吗？”他对她说，“我以前经常跟你谈起他。”随后又转向我：“你干吗不提前告诉我你要来这儿？你来这儿多久了？打算待到什么时候？为什么你不早来一个小时，我们一起吃晚饭？”

他连珠炮似的向我发问，把我安顿到一把椅子上，不住地拍打我的肩膀，好像我是个坐垫一样，把雪茄塞到我手上，又是让我吃小点心，又是让我喝葡萄酒。他一刻也不让我得闲。因为发现家里没有威士忌酒了，他难过得不得了，又想着给我煮咖啡，绞尽脑汁想尽可能地为我做点什么。他容光焕发，满脸是笑，仿佛每个汗毛孔都洋溢着快乐。

“你一点儿没变。”我边打量着他，边笑着说。

他还是我记忆中的那副可笑的模样。他是个矮胖的男人，两条小短腿，还是很年轻——他可能还不到三十岁——但是过早地秃顶了。他的脸滚圆，面色红润，皮肤很白，脸颊红通通，双唇也很红，眼睛也是又蓝又圆。他戴着一副大的金边眼镜，眉毛很淡，以至于都看不见它们。他的形象使你想到了鲁本斯画笔下快乐的肥胖商人。

我告诉他我打算在巴黎住上一段时间，已经租了一间小公寓。他狠狠地责怪了我一番，说为什么不早点儿告诉他，也许他自己会帮我找一间更好的公寓，还可以借给我家居用品——难道我真的花了一大笔冤枉钱去买这些东西了吗？——而且他还可以帮我搬家。他真的觉得我不够意思，因为我没有给他机会让他来帮一下我。与此同时，斯特罗伊夫太太坐在那儿安安静静地补袜子，一句话也没说，嘴角上挂着静静的微笑，在听斯特罗伊夫滔滔不绝地唠叨着。

“你瞧，我结婚了，”他突然说，“你觉得我太太怎么样？”

他笑容满面地看着她，推了推鼻梁上的眼镜，汗水使它不停地往下滑。

“你叫我怎么回答你的问题呢？”我笑着说。

“可不是嘛，迪尔柯。”斯特罗伊夫太太笑着插话道。

“可是你不觉得她太棒了吗？我告诉你，老朋友，别再耽误了，也赶紧结婚吧。我现在是世界上最幸福的人了。你看她坐在那儿，这难道不就是幅活生生的画吗？像不像夏尔丹[38]的画，啊？我见过世界上所有的漂亮女人，可从来没见过哪个女人比迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫太太更美丽。”

“如果你还不住嘴，我可要走了。”

“我的小乖乖。[39]”他说道。

她有点脸红了，为他语气中的激情而难为情。斯特罗伊夫曾在他的多封信中告诉我，他非常爱他的妻子。现在我也能看出他的目光几乎片刻不离她的左右。我不能确定她是否爱他。这个可怜的傻瓜[40]，他不是个能激起女人爱情的人，但是在她眼里的微笑是含着爱意的，也可能她的矜持掩盖了她深深的感情。她不是倾国倾城的美女，可他就是情人眼里出西施，但是她却有一种端庄的秀美。她的个头不低，一身剪裁得体的朴素衣衫掩盖不住她美丽的身段。她的这种身材可能对雕塑家比服装商更有吸引力。她的头发是褐色的，而且很浓密，发式很简单；她的脸色很苍白，五官周正而不是那么惊艳；她有一双灰色的眼睛。她差一点就与美貌失之交臂，也许就是差这么一点儿，连漂亮也称不上了。但是，斯特罗伊夫把她比作夏尔丹画笔下的人物也并非没有道理，她让我好奇地想起了那位伟大画家笔下不朽的人物形象——欢快的家庭主妇戴着女式帽子，腰间围着围裙。我能想象她安静地在锅碗瓢盆中忙碌着，像执行仪式一般做着家务，从而赋予这些家务一种崇高意义。我不认为她聪明或者活泼有趣，但是在她庄重与专注的神情里有某种说不上的东西，激起了我的兴趣，她的矜持中也有一种神秘感。我很好奇她为什么会嫁给了迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫，虽说她是英国人，但我无法确切地给她定位，她出身于怎样的社会阶层，有什么样的教养，或者在婚前她的生活状态是什么样的，这些都不是很明显。她的话不多，可一旦说起话来，声音很悦耳，举止也很自然。

我问斯特罗伊夫现在是否还在画画。

“画画？我现在画得可比以前好多了。”

我们正坐在画室里，他手一挥，让我看画架上一幅尚未完成的画作。我有点吃惊，他正在画一组意大利的农民，他们穿着坎帕尼亚大区[41]传统的服装，在罗马教堂的台阶上懒洋洋地斜躺着。

“这是你现在正在画的？”我问道。

“是的，我在这儿也跟在罗马一样能找到模特儿。”

“你难道不认为他画得很美吗？”斯特罗伊夫太太问道。

“我的傻夫人认为我是个了不起的艺术家。”他说道。

他表示歉意的笑声掩饰不住内心的喜悦。他的目光停留在自己的画上。当斯特罗伊夫评价别人的作品时，他批判性的感觉非常准确和不拘一格，而对自己的作品，尽管陈腐平凡，俗不可耐，他却自鸣得意，沾沾自喜，这真叫人不可思议。

“把你更多的画作给他看看吧。”她说道。

“我要拿出来吗？”

虽然迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫遭受了那么多来自他朋友们的讽刺挖苦，但还是渴望别人的赞许和有着很幼稚的自我满足，无法抑制展示他作品的冲动。他又拿出了一幅画，画上两个卷毛头发的意大利顽童正在玩弹子游戏。

“他们不是很可爱吗？”斯特罗伊夫问道。

接下来，他又给我看了更多的画。我发现即使在巴黎，他也还是一直在画那些陈腐不堪、花里胡哨的画，和他多年前在罗马时画的别无二致。这些画看上去都很虚假、缺乏真诚、劣质鄙俗，但是从做人上，没有谁能比得上迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫那样的诚实、真挚和直率。世上有谁能解决得了这种矛盾呢？

我不知道为什么脑子里突然冒出了一个问题，于是问道：

“我说，你是否碰巧遇到过一个叫查尔斯·斯特里克兰的画家？”

“你的意思不是说你认识他吧？”斯特罗伊夫喊道。

“那人是个畜生。”他的妻子说道。

斯特罗伊夫笑了笑。

“我可怜的宝贝。[42]”他走到她的身边，拿起她的双手吻了一下。“她不喜欢他。你竟然认识斯特里克兰，这是多么奇怪的事呀！”

“我就是不喜欢不懂礼貌的人。”斯特罗伊夫太太说道。

迪尔柯仍然在笑着，转过身对我解释说：

“你知道，有一天我请他来这儿，想给他看看我的画。他来了，我给他看了我所有的画。”

斯特罗伊夫尴尬地迟疑了一会儿，我不知道为什么他又开始讲述让他难堪的往事了；他觉得很难为情地讲完了它。“他看了看我的画作，什么也没说。我以为他要保留他的判断直到看完所有的才说。最后，我说：‘瞧，就是这些了！’他却说：‘我来是想让你借我二十法郎。’”

“迪尔柯还真就给他了。”他的妻子愤怒地说。

“我被吓了一跳，我不喜欢拒绝别人。他把钱放进兜里，仅仅点了点头，说了声‘谢谢！’，然后就走了。”

迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫在讲这件事的时候，他那圆圆的、傻里傻气的脸上挂着茫然而惊诧的神情，由不得你不想笑出声来。

“如果他说我的画不好，我不会介意的，可他什么也没说——一个字都没说。”

“你还有脸说这事，迪尔柯。”他的妻子说道。

可悲的是，无论是谁听了这个故事，都会被这个荷兰人所扮演的滑稽可笑的人物逗乐，而不会对斯特里克兰对待他的粗暴行为生气。

“我希望我一辈子也不会再见到他。”斯特罗伊夫太太说道。

斯特罗伊夫笑起来，耸了耸肩膀。他已经恢复了好脾气。

“事实上他是个了不起的艺术家，一个非常伟大的艺术家。”

“你是说斯特里克兰吗？”我叫道，“我们说的一定不是同一个人。”

“身材高大，留着红胡须，查尔斯·斯特里克兰，一个英国佬。”

“当我认识他时，他还没有胡须，但如果留起了胡须，那一定会是红色的。我正在谈到的这个人仅仅在五年前才开始画画。”

“那就对了，他是个伟大的艺术家。”

“不可能。”

“我可曾有过看走眼的时候？”迪尔柯问我，“我告诉你他是个天才，我对此深信不疑，一百年之后如果还有人能记起你和我，那完全是因为我们认识查尔斯·斯特里克兰的缘故。”

我很吃惊，与此同时，我又万分激动，我突然回忆起了我最后一次和他谈话时的情景。

“从哪儿可以看到他的作品？”我问，“他出了名没有？他现在住在哪儿？”

“不，他还没出名。我认为他还没卖出过一张画。当你同别人说起他时，他们只会嘲笑他。不过我知道他是个伟大的艺术家。毕竟，他们还嘲笑过马奈呢。柯罗[43]也是一张画没卖掉过。我不知道他住在哪里，但我能带你见到他，每天晚上七点钟，他都会到克里舍大街的一家咖啡馆去。如果你愿意，我们明天可以去那里。”

“我不敢肯定他是否愿意见我，我想我会让他记起一段他更愿意忘记的时光。但我还是会去的。有没有可能见到他的任何画作呢？”

“从他那儿不太可能。他不会给你看的。有一个我认识的小画商，他那儿有那么两三幅。但必须由我陪你去才行，要不你不会理解他的画的，我必须亲自给你讲解一下。”

“迪尔柯，你简直让我没耐心了，”斯特罗伊夫太太说，“他那么对待你，你怎么还这样谈论他的画作？”她又转向我说：“你知道吗，当一些荷兰人来这儿要买迪尔柯的画时，他总劝说他们去买斯特里克兰的画。他还坚持把斯特里克兰的画弄到这儿来给他们展示。”

“那你又是怎么看待斯特里克兰的画的？”我笑着问她。

“那些画糟糕透顶。”

“啊，亲爱的，你不懂。”

“那好，可你的那些荷兰同胞都对你大为光火，他们认为你正在跟他们开玩笑。”

迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫摘下了眼镜，把它们擦干净，他的红脸膛因为激动而发光。

“为什么你认为美——世界上最珍贵的东西——就像岸边的石头一样，让漫不经心的路人随随便便就能捡起来呢？美是一种绝妙和奇异的东西，艺术家通过心灵的折磨，在世界的一片混乱中才能找出来。当他把美创造出来以后，并非所有的人都能知道它。如果你想辨别出它，你必须重复艺术家的冒险。他歌唱给你的是美的旋律，你的内心若想再次听到它，就需要有知识、敏感和想象。”

“那为什么我总是认为你的画作是美的，迪尔柯？正是当我第一次看到它们时，我就深深地喜爱上它们了。”

斯特罗伊夫的嘴唇颤动了一下。

“去睡吧，我亲爱的，我要陪我的朋友出去走走，随后我就回来。”





第二十章


迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫答应第二天傍晚来接我，然后领我到斯特里克兰最可能出现的那家咖啡馆去。我饶有趣味地得知，这家咖啡馆正是上次我来巴黎找他时，我们俩一起喝苦艾酒的那家咖啡馆。事实上，他从未改变他那懒散的习惯，在我看来，这习惯正体现了他的个性。

“他在那儿。”当我们走到咖啡馆跟前时，斯特罗伊夫冲我说道。

虽然已是十月份了，但傍晚还是很温暖，摆在人行道上的桌子旁坐满了人，我用目光扫视了一下，没有看到斯特里克兰。

“看，那边，在角上。他正在下棋呢。”

我这才注意到，一个人正俯身看着棋盘，我能看见的只是一顶大毡帽和一把红胡须。我们穿过好几张桌子，走到他跟前。

“斯特里克兰。”

他抬起头来。

“嘿，胖子，你有什么事？”

“我带了一位老朋友来看你。”

斯特里克兰瞟了我一眼，显然没认出我来，他的目光又转到了棋盘上。

“先坐下，别作声。”他说道。

他走了一步棋，注意力马上又专注到了下棋上。可怜的斯特罗伊夫忧心忡忡地看了我一眼，但是我一点儿也没感到不安。我点了些喝的，安安静静地等着斯特里克兰下完这盘棋。我很乐见有这样的机会能够很放松地端详他。我确实已经认不出他来了。首先，他留起了红胡须，乱蓬蓬的，好像从未修剪过，遮住了他大部分的脸，头发也很长；但最让人感到吃惊的变化是他瘦了很多，这就使他的大鼻子显得傲慢地凸出来，也更凸显了颧骨，同时使得双眼似乎更大了。而他的太阳穴凹陷，身体形如枯槁。他还穿着五年前我见他时的同一件衣服，衣服已经破旧不堪，污渍点点，很多地方露出了线头，穿在身上松松垮垮，晃里晃荡，好像是别人的衣服。我还注意到了他的手，脏兮兮的，指甲很长，筋骨毕露，又大又有力，但我却记不清他的双手还曾这么匀称。他坐在那儿，留给我一个很特别的印象，他的注意力全在棋局上——一个孔武有力的印象，我无法理解为什么他的消瘦反而使这种印象更为突出。

又走了一步棋之后，他马上把身子向后一靠，用一种好奇和出神的目光紧紧地盯着对手。他的对手是一个胖胖的、满脸胡须的法国人，这个法国人考虑了一下棋局的形势，随后突然笑呵呵地骂了一句，做了一个无奈的手势，把棋子一拢，扔进了棋盒里。他口无遮拦地骂了斯特里克兰几句。然后又叫来侍者，付了两个人的酒钱，起身离开了。这时，斯特罗伊夫拉着椅子往桌子前凑了凑。

“现在，我想我们可以谈谈了。”他说道。

斯特里克兰的目光落在了他身上，目光里闪着某种恶意的揶揄。我敢肯定他正在搜肠刮肚地找一些嘲笑的词句，但可能一时没有找到，所以被迫沉默了一会儿。

“我带了一位老朋友来看你。”斯特罗伊夫满脸堆笑地把刚才的话又重复了一遍。

斯特里克兰若有所思地看了我将近一分钟，我没说话。

“我这辈子从没见过他。”他说道。

不知道为什么，当他说这话的时候，我的的确确地捕捉到他眼里闪过一丝已经认出我的微光。此时的我，已经不像多年前那么动不动就会轻易感到窘迫了。

“我前几天见到你妻子了，”我说，“我敢肯定你愿意听听她的近况。”

他干笑了一下，眼里闪着光。

“我们曾经一起度过了一个开心的晚上，”他说，“那是多久以前的事了？”

“五年了。”

他又要了一杯苦艾酒。斯特罗伊夫还在喋喋不休地解释他和我是怎么遇见的，而且机缘巧合地发现，我们俩都认识斯特里克兰，我不知道斯特里克兰是否在听，因为他好像还在沉思，有那么一两次他瞥了我几眼，但似乎大部分时间他都在想自己的事。当然，要是没有斯特罗伊夫的唠唠叨叨，场面会很尴尬。半个小时以后，荷兰人看了看他的手表，说他有事必须得走了。他问我是否和他一起走，我想，就我一个人，兴许还能从斯特里克兰那儿多掏点儿东西出来，所以我回答说我再待会儿。

等胖子斯特罗伊夫走了以后，我说道：

“迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫认为你是个伟大的艺术家。”

“你以为我他妈的在乎这话吗？”

“你能让我看看你的画吗？”

“我为什么要让你看？”

“说不定我有意买下一幅呢？”

“说不定我无意卖给你呢。”

“那你过得不错吧？”我笑着问道。

他咯咯地笑了起来。

“你看我像吗？”

“你看上去都快饿死了。”

“我就是快饿死了。”

“那么来吧，我们一起去吃点东西。”

“你为什么要邀请我？”

“肯定不是出于慈善的目的。”我冷冷地回答，“你饿死，饿不死，跟我没半点关系。”

他的双眼又在放光了。

“那就走吧，”他站起来说，“我还真想大吃一顿呢。”





第二十一章


我让他把我带到一家他选定的餐馆，在路上我买了一份报纸。当他为晚餐点菜的空当，我把报纸支在一瓶圣·卡尔米尔酒上，开始读了起来。我们相对无言，我能感觉到他时不时地看我几眼，但是我没有理会，打算迫使他先开口。

“报纸上有什么新闻？”在快接近这顿沉默的晚餐尾声的时候，他开腔了。

我感觉好像从他的口吻中听出他有点恼火。

“我向来喜欢读有关戏剧的评论[44]。”我说道。

我把报纸折叠上，放到我的一边。

“我已经享用完我的晚餐了，挺不错的。”他说道。

“我看我们就在这儿喝咖啡吧，怎么样？”

“好的。”

我们点着了雪茄，我默不作声地吸了一口。我注意到他的目光时不时地落在我身上，脸上挂着不易察觉的、觉得有趣的微笑。我耐心地等着他开口。

“自从上次见面后，你都在做些什么？”他终于忍不住开口问道。

我没有太多的话要说，无非是辛苦的写作，单调的生活，有时倒是也在某些方面搞点试验，或者某个方向上做点尝试，逐渐获得了书本和人性上的知识。我小心翼翼地一句话也不去问斯特里克兰，他的情况如何，我表现出对他一点儿兴趣也没有，最后，我的策略见了效。他开始谈自己的情况了，但是，他实在没有语言天赋，在他断断续续的表述中，我大致了解了他所经历的事，空缺的部分需要我自己靠想象力弥补。对于一个我非常感兴趣的人，只能听到点到为止的内容，这件事还真有点吊人胃口，就好像读一本残缺不全的书稿，还要捋清各种关系和事件。我得到的总体印象是，这个人的生活好像就是在跟各式各样的、更多的艰难困苦作着斗争，我更深刻地认识到，这些艰难困苦对于大多数人来说都是可怕和难以忍受的，但是对他来说，没有一丝一毫的影响。斯特里克兰和大多数的英国人不一样，因为他对舒适的生活完全无所谓，让他一辈子都住在一个破破烂烂的小房间里也不会让他烦恼，他完全不需要周围满是华美的东西。我料想他绝对没有注意到，当我第一次去找他时，他所住房间的墙纸是多么的肮脏。他甚至都不愿坐在一把安乐椅上，坐在没扶手的椅子上倒让他更轻松自在。他的胃口很好，但根本不在乎吃的是什么，只要是吃的，他狼吞虎咽地能够果腹就行。有时断了顿，他似乎还有挨饿的本领。我了解到，大约有半年的时间，他都靠每天一块面包、一瓶奶活着。他本来是一个沉湎于声色犬马的人，但面对各种诱惑又可以丝毫不动心。他不把生活的困顿看成是艰苦。他在生活态度上有种令人难忘的东西，他过的全然是一种精神生活。

当他把从伦敦带来的一小笔钱花完的时候，他也没有气馁沮丧和惊慌失措。他一张画也卖不出去，我认为他也根本没想去卖。他开始用某种方式挣了点小钱。他自我解嘲地告诉我，有段时间他曾经给那些想见识巴黎夜生活的伦敦人做导游，正好这个职业很适合他冷嘲热讽的脾气。在另一方面，他广泛了解和熟悉了这个城市中那些不体面的街区。他告诉我说，他得花数个小时在玛德莲大街走来走去，希望能受雇于那些想看法律所禁止的东西的英国佬，最好是带有几分醉意的人。运气好时，他能挣上一笔可观的小费。可后来，他那破破烂烂的衣服吓跑了观光客们，他找不到有足够冒险精神把自己交到他手上的客人了。随后，他碰巧也干过翻译专卖药品广告的活儿，这些药品要在英国作广告进行推销。在一次罢工期间，他还受雇做过房屋粉刷匠。

与此同时，他从未停止过他的艺术创作。但是不久以后，他厌烦了去各家画室画画，完全把自己关在了房间里创作。他从未像那时那样穷困潦倒，连买画布和颜料的钱都没有，至于别的东西，他倒是真的不需要。就我所能了解到的，他在绘画上遇到了很大困难，因为他不愿意接受任何人的帮助，所以把大量时间浪费在了自己摸索如何解决技巧上的难题，而这些难题几代以前的前辈们已经都一一解决了。他的目标是某种我不知道的东西，也许他自己也说不清楚。我过去有过对他的这种印象，而现在更加强烈了：他是被什么东西迷住了心窍。他似乎很不正常，不愿意把他的画作示人，在我看来，好像因为他自己对它们也不是真的感兴趣。他生活在梦中，现实被他视若无物。我有这样的感觉，他把自己狂暴个性的所有力量都施加到了画布上，在他的努力下，一切东西显然都被赋予了斯特里克兰思想的眼睛所看到的内容，最后完成的可能都不再是一幅画了。我知道他很少能把一件事做完，画画也一样，一阵激情燃烧完之后，也许就把一切都撂在那儿了。他对他所做的一切从来没满意过：同困扰他思想的幻象相比，他的画作根本不值一提。

“为什么你从不把你的作品送去展览？”我问，“我想你还是愿意听听人们的看法吧。”

“你会听吗？”

他说这话时的不屑一顾劲儿，我简直无法形容。

“你难道不想出名吗？那是大多数艺术家都很热衷的事呀。”

“妇人之见，如果你根本不在乎个别人对你作品的看法，你又怎么会在乎一群人对你的看法呢？”

“我们并非所有人都是理性的动物呀。”我笑着说。

“谁又成就了名声？是批评家、作家、证券经纪人，还是女人？”

“当你想到你不认识的一些人，一些从未见过的人从出自你手的画作中感受到了各种情感，细微而又充满激情，你难道不会感到欣喜和有成就感吗？每个人都喜欢展示力量，打动人的灵魂，让他们怜悯或害怕，我想不出能有什么比这更绝妙地展示力量的方式了。”

“一场滑稽戏。”

“那么你为什么对画得好还是不好，还是会介意呢？”

“我不介意，我只想把我看到的画下来。”

“如果我在一个荒岛上写作，唯一能确定的是，只有我自己能看到自己写下的东西，我怀疑我是否能坚持写下去。”

斯特里克兰很长时间没说话，但是他的眼睛奇怪地闪亮着，仿佛看见了某种点燃了灵魂，让他神魂颠倒的东西。

“有时我也想过一座迷失在无边无际大海上的荒岛，在岛上我可以住在隐秘的山谷、奇异的参天大树间，周围的一切都寂静无声。在那里，我认为可以发现我想要的东西。”

其实，他并没有真正地像这样表达，他用了各种手势，而不是形容词，讲得磕磕巴巴没有一句完整的话。我是用了我自己的语言，把我认为他想说的话给转述了出来。

“回首过去的五年，你认为值得吗？”我问道。

他看着我。我知道他没明白我的意思，便解释道：

“你放弃了安逸舒适的家和像普通人一样的幸福生活，你本来日子过得相当不错，而你在巴黎似乎日子都快过不下去了。如果时光能够倒流，你还会那样去做吗？”

“当然还会那样。”

“你知道你至今还没问任何有关你妻子和孩子的情况吗？你从来都不想他们吗？”

“不想。”

“我希望你他妈的别一个词一个词地往外蹦。你难道对你带给他们的所有不幸就没片刻的懊悔吗？”

他咧开嘴笑了笑，摇了摇头。

“我原以为你有时会忍不住想想过去的事，我的意思不是过去七八年前的事，还要再早一些，比如当你第一次遇见你的妻子，你爱上了她，后来又娶了她。难道你记不得你把她紧紧搂入怀中的喜悦了吗？”

“我从不回忆过去，对我来说，唯一重要的事情就是永恒的现在。”

我对这个回答思考了一会儿，也许这话说得含含糊糊，但我隐隐约约明白了他的意思。

“你幸福吗？”我问道。

“是的。”

我又沉默了。在沉思中我看着他，他也目不转睛地看着我，没过一会儿，嘲弄的意味又在他的眼睛里闪光。

“恐怕你对我有些看法吧？”

“废话，”我马上回答道，“我对蟒蛇没有什么看法，反过来，我对它的心理活动倒是很感兴趣。”

“你对我的兴趣纯粹是出于职业的角度吗？”

“纯粹是。”

“你不反对我是理所当然的，因为你的性格也很卑鄙。”

“兴许这就是你为什么觉得和我在一起很惬意的原因。”我反击道。

他干笑了一下，什么话也没说。我真希望我知道能够描述他微笑的方法，我觉得他的笑一点儿也不吸引人，但是能让他容光焕发，改变他脸上通常总是阴沉的表情，让他看上去不再那么充满恶意和刻薄。那是一种慢慢的微笑，从眼角开始，有时也在眼角结束。那是一种满是肉欲的微笑，既不残酷也不友善，但是不禁让人想到半人半兽的森林之神兽性的喜悦。正是这种微笑促使我问他：

“自从你来到巴黎以后，你又恋爱过吗？”

“我可没时间干这种胡闹的事。生命短暂，没有时间既谈恋爱又搞艺术。”

“你的样子可不像个六根清净的隐士呀。”

“所有这类事都让我恶心。”

“人性是个累赘，不是吗？”我说道。

“你干吗冲着我傻笑？”

“因为我信不过你说的话。”

“那你就是个该死的傻瓜。”

我没说话，仔细地打量起他来。

“你想骗我有什么用？”我说道。

“我不明白你的意思。”

我笑了。

“让我告诉你吧。我能想象得到，有好几个月了，那种事确实没进到你脑子里，然后你能说服自己已经永远地跟它绝缘了，你为自己获得了自由而欢呼，你觉得你能控制自己的灵魂。你似乎可以昂首挺胸地在星辰中漫步。可是后来，你突然觉得无法再忍受了，你注意到你的双脚其实一直走在烂泥沼中，你甚至还想在里面打个滚儿，你去找女人，粗野、低贱、俗气的女人，她兽性十足，可怕的性欲露骨地表现，你就像野兽一样把她扑倒，你喝得烂醉，直到怒不可遏。”

他一动不动地盯着我，我也盯着他的眼睛，我非常缓慢地说道：

“我还要告诉你，这一切似乎荒诞不经，当你完事以后，你觉得自己格外的纯洁。你感觉就像灵魂出窍，无形缥缈。你能够触碰到美，好像它是一个摸得着的东西，你觉得你可以和微风亲密私语，和冒出嫩叶的树木交流，和波光粼粼的河流对话。你觉得自己就像上帝一样。你能跟我解释一下这种感觉吗？”

他目不转睛地看着我的眼睛，直到我把话说完，然后才扭过脸去。在他的脸上有一种奇怪的表情，我想那应该是一个人受尽折磨后要死去时的表情。他沉默不语，我知道我们的谈话结束了。





第二十二章


我在巴黎安顿下来，开始着手写一部剧本。我的生活过得非常规律，上午写作，下午在卢森堡公园徜徉，或者在大街上散步。我每天花好几个小时在罗浮宫，它是所有的美术馆中最友好的，也是最便于沉思默想的。有时也去码头逛逛，随便翻翻我并不打算买的旧书，再随意读上几页，这样我就可以泛泛地熟悉一下我想了解的很多作家。傍晚的时候，我去看朋友，经常去斯特罗伊夫夫妇家，有时还在他们家蹭顿简单的晚饭。迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫自夸他的意大利菜做得很拿手，我也不得不承认，他的意大利通心粉做得确实比他画的画要好得多，那简直就是为国王做的御膳。他用大盘子盛上满满的通心粉，再配上多汁的西红柿。然后我们一起享用自家烤制的好吃的面包，喝上一瓶红葡萄酒。我和布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫也逐渐熟络起来。我想也许因为我是英国人，而她在这儿认识的英国人很少，所以她很高兴见到我。她很招人喜欢和简单纯朴，但总是寡言少语，而且，不知道为什么，总给我一种印象，她好像在掩饰着某种东西。但我想这也许是她生性拘谨的缘故，而且在她啰里啰唆、心直口快的丈夫的反衬下，她的这种缄默更显得突出了。迪尔柯从不掩饰任何事情，他会当众讨论最隐秘的事情，而全然没有意识到这点。有时他会让他的妻子感到难为情。有一次我看见她脸上终于挂不住了，因为她丈夫坚持要告诉我他曾经服了泻药，而且把这事的细节描述到了栩栩如生的地步。他讲述他遭罪的样子还特别一本正经，让我都笑出了眼泪，这就更给斯特罗伊夫太太火上浇油了。

“你好像就喜欢把自己弄成一个傻瓜似的。”她说道。

看到他太太真的生气了，他的圆眼睛瞪得更圆了，眉毛也不知所措地皱了起来。

“亲爱的，我惹你生气了吗？我下次再也不吃泻药了，这都怪我肝火太盛的缘故，我整天坐着，运动也不够，都三天了，我还没……”

“看在上帝的分上，你能不能闭嘴呀。”她打断了他的话，气得眼泪在眼眶里打转。

他的脸色也沉下来了，噘着嘴，就像一个受了批评的孩子。他给了我一个求助的眼神，好让我给和和稀泥，但我实在控制不了自己，笑得直不起腰来。

有一天，我们去了一个画商那里，斯特罗伊夫认为在他的店里至少有斯特里克兰的两三幅画，斯特罗伊夫觉得他还可以给我讲讲。但当我们到了店里的时候，画商告诉我俩，斯特里克兰自己又把画拿走了，他也不知道什么原因。

“不要以为我会为这事上火，我代卖它们全是看在斯特罗伊夫先生的面子上，我说会尽量把这些画卖掉，但说真的——”他耸了耸肩，“我对年轻人是有兴趣的，但是你自己也知道[45]，斯特罗伊夫先生，你也认为他们当中不会有什么天才。”

“我以我的名誉担保，如今没有谁的绘画天赋能像斯特里克兰那样让我更信服了，记着我的话，你丢掉了一桩好买卖。终究会有那么一天，那几张画会比你店里所有的画加在一起都更有价值。你还记得莫奈吧，当时出一百法郎都没人买他的画，可现在它们值多少了？”

“你说得没错。可当时有一百个像莫奈一样棒的画家，同莫奈一样卖不出他们的画，他们的画今天还是一文不值，这你怎么解释？画家只有画得好才能成名吗？别相信这种鬼话，再说[46]，你的这位朋友画得好，这一点还没得到证明呢，没人说他画得好，只有您，斯特罗伊夫先生除外。”

“那么，你说说，你怎么辨认一个画家画得好不好？”迪尔柯问道，他的脸都气红了。

“只有唯一的途径——看他是否成功。”

“市侩。”迪尔柯喊道。

“但是你想想过去的那些伟大的艺术家们吧——拉斐尔、米开朗琪罗、安格尔[47]、德拉克罗瓦[48]——他们都取得了成功。”

“我们走吧，”斯特罗伊夫对我说，“否则我会杀了这家伙。”





第二十三章


我经常可以见到斯特里克兰，而且还时不时地跟他一起下棋。这家伙的脾气变化无常。有时坐在那里，安静而又茫然，目中无人；有时兴致来了，他会用自己特有的结结巴巴的方式跟人聊天。他虽然说不出机智诙谐的话来，但几分蛮不讲理的讽刺挖苦倒也效果明显，而且总是怎么想的就怎么说，不打半分折扣。他毫不顾忌别人的感受，而且以刺伤别人的感情为乐。他不断刻薄地打击迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫，惹得斯特罗伊夫怒气冲冲地甩手而去，发誓再也不跟他说话了。但是在斯特里克兰身上好像有种坚实的力量，吸引着这个肥胖的荷兰人屡屡打破他的誓言，最后又乖乖回来了，像只笨狗一样摇尾乞怜，纵然他知道迎接他的唯一问候就是当头一棒。

我不知道为什么斯特里克兰倒能容得下我，我们之间的关系很特殊。有一天他让我借给他五十法郎。

“这真是让我连做梦也没想到的事。”我回应道。

“为什么没想到？”

“这叫我有点不爽。”

“我快揭不开锅了。你知道。”

“我不在乎。”

“如果我快饿死了，你也不在乎？”

“我干吗要在乎？”我反问道。

他盯着我看了有一两分钟，一面揪着他乱蓬蓬的胡须。我笑着看着他。

“有什么好笑的？”他说，眼睛里有点冒火。

“你可太单纯了。既然你眼里没责任和义务，自然也没人有责任和义务帮你。”

“我要是付不起房租，被赶了出来，走投无路去上吊，你看着心里不会不舒服吗？”

“一点儿也不会。”

他咯咯笑了起来。

“你就吹吧，要是我真的上了吊，你会后悔一辈子的。”

“那就试试，我们走着瞧。”我反击道。

他的目光中露出一丝微笑，默默地搅和着他的苦艾酒。

“你想下棋吗？”我问道。

“我不反对。”

我们摆好棋子，棋盘就绪后，他用舒心的目光打量了一下棋盘。对于好下棋的人来说，当你看到兵马已经就位，摆开一副厮杀的架势，一种满足感总会油然而生。

“你当真认为我会借给你钱吗？”我问道。

“我看不出你有不借的理由。”

“你让我有点吃惊。”

“为什么？”

“发现你在内心深处还是多愁善感的，这一点让我有些失望。如果你没有天真地想唤起我的同情心，我可能会更喜欢你一些。”

“如果你被我打动了，我会瞧不起你的。”他回答道。

“这就好多了。”我笑出了声来。

我们开始下棋，注意力都集中在了棋局上。下完一局后，我对他说：

“你听我说，如果你真的揭不开锅了，让我看看你的画吧，要是有我喜欢的，我可以买上一两幅。”

“见你的鬼去吧。”他回答道。

他站起身来，拔腿要走。我拦住了他。

“你还没付你的苦艾酒钱呢。”我笑着说。

他骂了我一句，扔下钱，扭头离开了。

从那以后，我有好几天没看见他，但有一天傍晚，当我正坐在咖啡馆里读报纸的时候，他走过来坐在了我旁边。

“你最终还是没上吊呀。”我说道。

“没有。我找了一个活儿。我正在给一个退休的管子工画肖像，能挣二百法郎。[49]”

“你是怎么揽到这笔买卖的？”

“我常去买面包那家店的女主人推荐了我。这个人告诉她，他正在找能给他画肖像的人。我给了她二十法郎作为回报。”

“是个怎样的人？”

“没得挑。他长着一张像羊腿一样的大红脸，在他的右脸颊有一颗大大的痣，痣上还长着长长的毛。”

斯特里克兰兴致很高。当迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫走进来在我们身边落座后，他开始用放肆的玩笑话又攻击起他来。斯特里克兰有一种技能，当然这种技能我是绝不应该赞扬的，他总能找到这位不幸的荷兰人最薄弱的地方加以攻击。斯特里克兰不仅把讽刺作为轻剑准确地一剑封喉，而且用谩骂作为大头棒劈头盖脸一阵痛击。这打击来得无缘无故，让斯特罗伊夫不知所措，完全失去了抵抗的能力，像一只受了惊的小羊，毫无目标地东逃西窜。他吓坏了，也吓蒙了，最后，眼泪扑簌簌地从眼中滚落下来。最糟的是，虽然你会痛恨斯特里克兰，觉得这出戏很可怕，但又不可能不哈哈大笑。迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫是一个倒霉蛋，他发自肺腑的真挚感情往往让人觉得滑稽可笑。

然而，尽管如此，当我回想起在巴黎的那个冬天时，迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫给了我最温暖舒心的回忆。在他的小屋子里，总有一种宾至如归的亲切感，他和他妻子构成一幅图画，让我的想象力充满感激地停留，他对他妻子淳朴的爱有着一种细腻的优雅。他的表现虽然荒谬，但他感情的真挚会激起人们的同情。我能理解他的妻子对他的感受，我也高兴地看到她对他的温柔情感。如果她有幽默感，当她看到他把她放到宝座上，作为偶像一样虔诚地顶礼膜拜的话，她一定会觉得好笑的，但即使她开口大笑，在开心的同时，内心也会被感动。他对她的爱永远不会改变，虽然有一天她会变老，失去丰满的身段和秀美的容貌，对他来说，她始终是年轻的模样，绝不会有丝毫的变化。在他的眼中，她永远是世界上最可爱的女人，在他们平凡的生活中，始终有一种令人愉快的优雅。他们只有一间画室、一间卧室和一间小厨房。斯特罗伊夫太太自己承担下了所有的家务活，当迪尔柯在画他那不怎么样的画时，她去市场买菜，做午饭，缝缝补补，像只小蜜蜂一样在整个白天忙忙碌碌；在晚上，她会坐在画室里，一边又拿起了针线活，一边听着迪尔柯演奏音乐，虽然我敢肯定，她根本听不懂这音乐的内容。他演奏得很有水平，但总是投入了过多的感情，在他的音乐中，倾注了他所有的诚实、多愁善感和充满活力的灵魂。

他们的生活是田园诗式的，成功地体现出了独特的美。虽然与迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫相联系的每件东西都被赋予了滑稽的色彩，但给这种生活增添了奇妙的音符，如同一个不可调和的变调，反而在某种程度上增加了生活的现代性和人性化。又如同在一个肃穆的场景中冒出了一句粗俗的笑话，加强了所有美中所包含的辛酸与辛辣。





第二十四章


就在圣诞节来临前，迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫过来找我，邀请我和他一起过节。他对圣诞节有种挺有特点的多愁善感，想和朋友们一起用合适的仪式来度过。我们俩都有两三周没见过斯特里克兰了，我是因为有一些朋友来巴黎玩了一阵子，我忙于陪他们；而斯特罗伊夫是因为和他大吵了一架，这次架吵得比以往厉害得多，他已经下定决心和他一刀两断了。斯特里克兰太不可理喻了，斯特罗伊夫发誓绝不再和他说一句话。但是，这个季节又触动了他感情中柔软的地方，他实在不忍心让斯特里克兰独自一个人过圣诞节。斯特罗伊夫推己及人地把自己的感情也等同于他了，他不能忍受在圣诞节这样一个理应相互恩爱的节日里，让这位画家一个人孤零零地被抛弃，独自悲伤。斯特罗伊夫在他的画室里安放了一棵圣诞树，我猜想我们能在上面找到一些可笑的小礼物，它们悬挂在喜庆的树枝中间。但是他不好意思再去见斯特里克兰了，因为这么容易就原谅斯特里克兰带给他的侮辱，未免太低三下四了，所以他希望当他决定和斯特里克兰重归于好时，我能够在场。

我们一起走到了克里舍大街，但斯特里克兰没在咖啡馆里。天气已经太冷，不能坐在外面了，我们在里面找了一个皮长凳坐下来。咖啡馆里又热又闷，空气因烟雾缭绕而变得灰蒙蒙的。虽然我们没见着斯特里克兰，但很快看到了偶尔和他下棋的一位法国画家，我和这位画家多少还算认识，他坐到了我们的桌子前。斯特罗伊夫问他近来是否见到过斯特里克兰。

“他病了，”他说，“你不知道？”

“病得厉害吗？”

“很厉害，据我所知。”

斯特罗伊夫的脸色变得煞白。

“为什么他不写信告诉我呀？我还和他吵架，我真是太蠢了！我们必须马上去看看他，他身边肯定没人照顾。他住在哪儿呀？”

“我不知道。”那位法国人说道。

我们发现没人知道在哪儿能找到他。斯特罗伊夫变得越来越难过了。

“他可能死了，没人会知道一点消息的，太可怕了。我受不了这个念头，我们必须马上找到他。”

我试图让斯特罗伊夫明白，漫无目的地在巴黎瞎找一个人是很荒唐的，我们必须首先有一个计划。

“是的，但也许就在我们想办法的时候，他可能快咽气了，当我们到那儿时，一切都为时已晚了。”

“你安静地坐会儿，让我们想想办法。”我不耐烦地说道。

我唯一知道的地址就是比利时旅馆，但斯特里克兰已经离开那里很久了，那里的人估计记不得他了。而且他有着奇怪的想法，不想让人知道他的行踪。所以，在离开那家旅馆的时候，不太可能会告诉人家他搬到了何处。再说了，这都是五年多以前的事了。但是我敢肯定的是，如果他还继续光顾他住在那家旅馆时常去的咖啡馆的话，就不会搬得很远的，因为这家咖啡馆对他来说，可能是最方便去的。突然，我想到了通过他买面包的那家店主人，他揽到了一桩给人画肖像的活儿。我灵机一动：问问这家面包店的主人，可能会找到他的地址。我叫人拿来一本电话簿，开始查找面包店。在那个地区附近有五家面包店，唯一要做的就是挨家询问。斯特罗伊夫不太情愿地陪着我，他自己的计划是在与克里舍大街相连的大街上都跑跑，见到每家旅馆都进去问问斯特里克兰是否住在那里。不管怎么说，我的具有常识性的计划更有效。在第二家面包店，我们问到的一位在柜台后面的女人承认她认识斯特里克兰，虽然她不能确定他具体住在哪儿，但她能肯定就在面包店对面的三栋楼里的一栋。幸运再次垂青了我们，就在我们尝试的第一栋楼里，门房告诉我们，在楼的最顶层可以找到他。

“好像他生病了吧。”斯特罗伊夫说道。

“好像是的，”门房冷冰冰地回答，“事实上[50]，我好几天都没看到他了。”

斯特罗伊夫在我前面跑上了楼梯，当我爬到顶层时，看见他正在和一个穿着衬衫的工人讲话。在我到之前，斯特罗伊夫敲了一扇门，开门的正是这个工人，他指了指旁边的一扇门，认为住在那间房里的是一位画家，他似乎有一周没见着他了。斯特罗伊夫刚要敲门，又转过身来对我做了一个无助的手势，我看得出他有些惊恐不安。

“要是他死了怎么办？”

“他不会死的。”我说道。

我敲了敲门，没人应声。我试着拧了拧门把手，发现门没锁。我走了进去，斯特罗伊夫紧跟着我。房间里漆黑一片，我只能分辨出这是间阁楼，屋顶是倾斜着的，从天窗上透过一丝微弱的亮光，并不比房间里的昏暗亮多少。

“斯特里克兰。”我叫道。

没人回答，气氛相当的神秘，我好像能感觉到斯特罗伊夫在我身后，双腿哆嗦成了筛糠。一时间，我犹豫是不是该划根火柴，我隐约感觉到在角落里有张床，我想知道在火柴光下，会不会发现床上躺着个死人。

“你没有火柴吗？你这傻瓜。”

从黑暗中传来斯特里克兰刺耳的呵斥声，吓了我一跳。

斯特罗伊夫吓得喊了出来。

“哦，我的上帝呀，我以为你已经死了。”

我划着了一根火柴，四下打量想找一根蜡烛，借助火柴短暂的微光，我看到这是间很小的公寓，半间卧室，半间画室，除了一张床以外，几乎没什么家具，画布对着墙壁，一个画架、一张桌子和一把椅子。地板上没有地毯，也没有壁炉。在桌子上乱七八糟地堆放着颜料盒、调色刀和各种杂物，好在还有一小截蜡烛。我点着了它，看见斯特里克兰正躺在床上，因为床对于他的个头来说太小了，他躺得很不舒服，为了取暖，他把所有衣服都盖在了身上。很显然，只要瞅一眼，就知道他在发着高烧。斯特罗伊夫走到床前，激动得嗓子都沙哑了。

“噢，我可怜的朋友，你怎么了？我真不知道你病了。你为什么不告诉我呀？你知道我会为你做任何事情的。你还在为争吵而生我的气吗？我真的不是想惹你生气，我错了，我说的那些冒犯你的话真是愚蠢透顶。”

“见你的鬼去吧。”斯特里克兰说道。

“现在，你先冷静点儿，我帮你躺得舒服点儿。没人照顾你吗？”

斯特罗伊夫惊愕地环顾着这间肮脏的阁楼，他想帮着整整被褥。斯特里克兰费劲地呼吸着，气呼呼地一声不吭。他恶狠狠地看了我一眼，我十分安静地站在那儿，端详着他。

“如果你想为我做点事，可以给我弄点牛奶去，”他终于开口道，“我已经有两天没有出门了。”

在床边，有一个盛牛奶的瓶子，现在已经空了，在一张报纸上还有一些面包屑。

“你吃过东西吗？”我问道。

“什么也没吃。”

“有多长时间了？”斯特罗伊夫嚷嚷道，“你的意思是你已经有两天都没吃没喝了？太可怕了。”

“我喝过一点水。”

他的目光停留在一个大水罐上，这个水罐他一伸手就能够到。

“我马上去买，”斯特罗伊夫说，“你还要别的什么东西吗？”

我建议他再买一个暖水瓶、一串葡萄和一些面包。斯特罗伊夫找到这么一个发挥作用的机会很开心，他噔噔地跑下了楼梯。

“他妈的傻瓜。”斯特里克兰嘟囔道。

我摸了摸他的脉搏，脉跳得很快而且很弱。我问了他一两个问题，他都不回答，当我继续追问时，他生气地把脸转向了墙壁。我唯一能做的就是静静地等待。大约过了十分钟，斯特罗伊夫气喘吁吁地回来了。除了我建议要买的那些东西，他还买了蜡烛、肉汁和酒精灯。他是一个很能干的人，没有片刻耽误他就把面包和牛奶准备好了。我又量了量斯特里克兰的体温，有一百零四度[51]，他病得着实不轻。





第二十五章


过了一会儿，我们离开了斯特里克兰的住处。迪尔柯回家去吃晚饭，我说好去找一个大夫，带他去看看斯特里克兰的病。但当我们走到大街上，从憋闷的阁楼出来，刚呼吸了一口新鲜空气，这个荷兰人就恳求我马上跟他回他的画室。显然他脑子里有了什么想法，但还没告诉我。他坚持说很有必要让我陪着他，因为医生此刻能做的事比我们已经做的多不了哪里去。我只好同意。当我们进门的时候，布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫正在摆桌子，已备好了晚餐。迪尔柯走上前去，抓着她的双手。

“亲爱的，我想求你为我做点事情。”他说道。

她看着他，严肃中透着快乐，这正是她的迷人之处。他红色的脸膛因为汗水而闪亮，一副可笑的激动的样子，在他圆圆的、好像受到惊吓的眼睛里透着一种急切的光芒。

“斯特里克兰病得很厉害，他可能快死了，自己待在一间脏兮兮的阁楼里，身边没一个人照料他，我想求你让我把他带到这儿来。”

她很快抽回了双手——我从来没见过她动作如此的迅速——脸也红了。

“噢，不行。”

“哦，我亲爱的，不要拒绝吧，我真的无法忍受把他一个人丢在那儿，想到那种情景，我睡觉都闭不上眼睛。”

“我不反对你去照顾他。”

她的声音冷冷的，拒人于千里之外的感觉。

“可是他快死了。”

“让他死去吧。”

斯特罗伊夫倒吸了一口气，抹了一把脸。他转向我寻求支持，可我不知说什么好。

“他是一个伟大的艺术家。”

“关我什么事？我恨他。”

“哦，亲爱的，我的宝贝，你不会是这个意思吧，我恳求你让我把他带到这儿来吧。我们能让他舒服些，也许我们还能救他的命。他不会给你添什么麻烦的，我来做一切事情，我们在画室里给他安张床，我们不能让他像条狗一样死去呀，那也太没人性了。”

“他干吗不去医院？”

“医院！他需要有充满慈爱的双手来照料，他必须得到精心护理才行。”

我很吃惊地看到她被打动了，她继续摆桌子，但双手在颤抖。

“我没有耐心听你叨叨，如果是你病了，你觉得他会伸出一根手指头来帮你吗？”

“那有什么关系？我有你照料我呀，没必要让他来帮我。再说了，我和他不一样，我是微不足道的。”

“你连一只杂种小狗的志气都没有！你躺在地上，让人从你身上践踏过去。”

斯特罗伊夫笑了笑，觉得明白他妻子这种态度的原因了。

“哦，我可怜的宝贝，你还想着那天他来我们家看我画的事呀。如果他觉得我的画画得不怎么样，这又有什么关系？我让他看我的画，这事本来做得就不够聪明，我也敢说这些画确实不怎么样。”

他可怜巴巴地环顾了一下画室。在画架上还有一幅完成了一半的画——一个笑着的意大利农民，正拿着一大串葡萄放到一个黑眼睛姑娘的头上。

“即使他不喜欢你的画，也应该有礼貌些，没有必要侮辱你。他表现得很鄙视你，而你还在舔他的手。哦，我恨死他了。”

“亲爱的，他很有天分，你不会认为我觉得自己也有吧，我倒是希望我有。但是我知道当我看见这种天分时，我从心底里尊重它，它是世界上最不可思议的东西，可对拥有它的人，天分又是巨大的负担。我们应该对他们非常容忍，非常有耐心。”

我站在一旁，被这家庭中的一幕弄得有些尴尬。我搞不清楚为什么斯特罗伊夫坚持让我和他一起回来。我看到他的妻子都快被气哭了。

“不仅因为他是个天才，我才求你让我把他带来的，而且因为他是个人呀，他贫病交加。”

“我绝不会让他进我们家门的——绝不。”

斯特罗伊夫转向了我。

“告诉她这是件生死攸关的事情，无论如何不能把他扔在那个悲惨的老鼠洞里不管。”

“在这儿照料他要容易得多，这谁都能看出来，”我说，“但显而易见的是也会很不方便。我知道得有人不分昼夜地陪着他。”

“我亲爱的，你不是个偷懒怕麻烦的人呀。”

“如果他来了，我就走。”斯特罗伊夫太太疯了似的说道。

“我都认不出你了，你本来那么善良，那么心肠软。”

“噢，看在老天爷的分上，你别再逼我了，你把我都快逼疯了。”

终于她的眼泪流了下来，她一屁股瘫坐到了椅子上，用双手蒙住了脸，肩膀剧烈地抽动着。过了一会儿，迪尔柯双膝跪在了她的身边，双臂抱着她，亲吻她，叫着她的各种昵称，说来就来的眼泪在他的双颊上流淌。过了一会儿，她从他的怀抱中挣脱出来，擦干了眼泪。

“让我一个人待会儿吧。”她的口气不那么恶狠狠的了，然后对着我，努力想挤出一丝微笑：“让你见笑了，真不知你会把我看成什么样的人了？”

斯特罗伊夫困惑地看着她，一时有点手足无措。他的眉头紧锁，红色的嘴巴噘着，他的怪样子让我想起了一只受到惊吓的豚鼠。

“那么，你还是坚决不同意喽，亲爱的？”他最终说道。

她有气无力地挥了一下手，似乎已经精疲力竭了。

“这间画室是你的，这里的一切都属于你。如果你想把他带到这儿来，我怎么能拦得住呢？”

在他的圆脸上，突然闪现了微笑。

“那就是说你同意了？我就知道你会的，哦，我亲爱的宝贝。”

突然，她又克制住自己，用暗淡的眼神望着他，她十指交叉地把手放到胸口上，好像心脏跳动得让人无法忍受。

“哦，迪尔柯，自从我们在一起，我从来没要求过你为我做什么。”

“你知道，在世上没有任何事情我不会为你做。”

“我乞求你别把斯特里克兰带到咱们家来。其他任何人你都可以带来，小偷、醉鬼、街头流浪汉，我向你保证，我会开心地为他们做一切事情，但我恳求你别把斯特里克兰带来。”

“可是为什么呀？”

“我害怕他，我不知道为什么，但他身上有种东西吓着我了，他会给我们带来伤害的，我知道的，我感觉到了。如果你非要把他带来不可，结局只能很悲惨。”

“可你这话多么不理性呀！”

“不，不。我知道我是对的。可怕的事情会降临到我们身上。”

“就因为我们做了一件好事？”

她现在又气喘吁吁了，脸上出现了难以名状的恐惧。我不知道她的想法，觉得她被某种无形的、可怕的东西所占据，失去了自我控制的能力。她本来一贯那么冷静，而现在的惊恐不安让人感到吃惊。斯特罗伊夫盯着她看了好一会儿，既困惑不解，又惊慌失措。

“你是我的妻子，是我在世上最亲的人，在没有征得你完全同意之前，没人会来咱们家。”

她闭了一会儿眼睛，我想她都快晕倒了，我对她有点失去了耐心，我以前从没怀疑过她竟是一个神经质的女人。这时，我再次听到斯特罗伊夫的声音响了起来，似乎打破了这阵奇怪的沉默。

“你以前没有过痛苦万分的经历，而有人曾经向你伸出过援手吗？你知道这帮助意味着什么。当你有这样的机会时，你难道不愿意也帮助别人吗？”

这些话虽然很普通，但在我的心里，觉得在这番话里有着劝诫的意味。我笑了。但我大吃一惊地发现这些话对布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫产生了效果。她惊跳了一下，长久地盯着她的丈夫，而此时斯特罗伊夫的眼睛却盯着地面。我搞不懂为什么他看上去有些窘迫。斯特罗伊夫太太的脸颊上又泛起了淡淡的红晕，而接下来她的脸又变白了——变得惨白，让人觉得好像血液一下子从她的身体表面被抽干了，甚至她的双手也变得苍白无色。一阵颤抖像打摆子一样掠过她的全身，画室的沉寂似乎凝结成了冰块，几乎成了触手可及的东西。我大惑不解。

“把斯特里克兰带到这儿来吧，迪尔柯，我会尽力照顾他的。”

“我的宝贝。”他笑了。

他想再次把她揽入怀中，但她躲避了他。

“别在生人面前卿卿我我的，迪尔柯，”她说，“那会让我觉得自己是个傻瓜。”

她的举止再次变得十分正常，没人能够看出就在刚才她还经历着情绪的大起大落。





第二十六章


第二天，我们就去给斯特里克兰搬家，要劝说他跟我们来需要足够的坚持和更多的耐心，可他真的病得太厉害了，无法对斯特罗伊夫的恳求和我的决心做出有效的抵抗。我们给他穿好衣服，在此期间，尽管他很虚弱，也还不住嘴地咒骂着，我们给他弄下楼，扶进马车，终于到了斯特罗伊夫的画室。当我们到达的时候，斯特里克兰也快筋疲力尽了，一言不发地允许我们把他抬到了床上。他已经病了六周，一度看上去好像活不过几个小时了，但我坚信正是有了荷兰人的顽强坚持，他才在鬼门关边上走了一圈。我以前还未见过谁病得如此之重，他没有让人觉得难伺候，也没有动不动就发脾气，正相反，他从不抱怨，从不提什么要求，绝对的安静。然而，他好像对别人对他的照料心生怨恨；当别人问他感觉怎么样或需要点什么的时候，他总是报以嘲弄、冷笑或者咒骂。我觉得他实在是可恶，等他刚刚脱离危险，我就毫不犹豫地告诉了他我的想法。

“你去下地狱吧。”他回答得倒也干脆。

迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫完全放弃了他所有的工作，充满怜悯而又无微不至地护理着斯特里克兰。他照顾病人时，动作敏捷灵巧，让他尽量舒服。而且他还能耍手腕成功地诱使斯特里克兰服下医生所开的药物，这是我所没有想到的。无论怎样的麻烦对于斯特罗伊夫来说都算不了什么。虽然他的收入对于维持他们夫妇两人的生活来说不至于捉襟见肘，但肯定日子也不能大手大脚地过。可是现在他购买起各种美味，无论是不合时令的还是价格奇高的，可以说是毫无节制地铺张，为的就是勾起斯特里克兰反复无常的胃口。我一辈子也不会忘记，为了劝说斯特里克兰多增加营养，他千方百计、不厌其烦地做工作的耐心。他从不计较斯特里克兰对他的粗暴，如果对方仅仅在生闷气，他就装作没看见；如果对方咄咄逼人，他只咯咯地笑两声。当斯特里克兰身体恢复一些了，在兴致高的时候，会拿嘲笑他取乐，他甚至故意做些荒唐的事情激起斯特里克兰对他的讽刺挖苦。然后，他会向我投来开心的一瞥，让我能够注意到病人的状况已经好多了。斯特罗伊夫实在是太崇高了。

但最让我吃惊的还是布兰奇。她证明了她不仅是一个有能力，而且是一个全身心奉献的护士。在她身上一点也看不出她曾经那么强烈地反对她丈夫想把斯特里克兰接到画室的愿望。病人需要照料的地方很多，她坚持尽自己的一份力量。她整理病人的床铺时，会在不打扰病人的情况下，尽可能麻利地更换床单。她帮他梳洗。当我赞扬她的能干时，她带着令人愉快的浅笑对我说，她曾经在医院工作过一段时间。她没有表现出丝毫曾深恶痛绝地恨过斯特里克兰的迹象，她跟他的话不多，但她很快就能提前知道他想要什么。有两周的时间需要有人整夜地陪护他，她和她丈夫两人轮班护理他。我很想知道，在漫漫长夜中，她坐在他的床边究竟在想什么。斯特里克兰是个很奇怪的家伙，当他躺在床上的时候，他比以往任何时候都要瘦，红胡须乱蓬蓬的，眼睛狂热地凝视空中，他的这场病使得眼睛更大了，而且闪烁着不自然的光芒。

“在晚上，他和你说过话吗？”有一次我问她。

“从来没说过。”

“你还像过去那样不喜欢他吗？”

“比以前更不喜欢了。”

她用安静的、灰色的眼睛看着我。她的表情是那么的安详，难以置信我曾目睹过她狂风暴雨般的感情宣泄。

“对你为他所做的一切，他曾经表示过感谢吗？”

“没有。”她笑着说。

“他这人真没人情味。”

“他可恶至极。”

当然，斯特罗伊夫对她很满意，她接受了他撂给她的负担，而且全身心地奉献，他无论怎么做都无法表示出对她的感激之情。但是，他对于布兰奇和斯特里克兰之间相互对待对方的行为感到有点疑惑。

“你知道吗，我曾经看见他们一起坐在那儿，好几个小时没说一句话。”

有那么一次，斯特里克兰身体已经好多了，再有一两天他就可以起床了，我和他们坐在画室里。迪尔柯和我在聊天，斯特罗伊夫太太在缝补衣服，我想我认出来了，她正缝补的衬衣是斯特里克兰的。斯特里克兰仰面朝天躺着，没有说话。我看见他的目光一度牢牢地固定在布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫身上，但里面包含着好奇的嘲弄。好像感觉到了有目光的凝视，布兰奇抬起了头，有一段时间，他们彼此凝视对方。我不是很理解她脸上的表情，她的眼睛里有一种奇怪的困惑，也许是——但是为什么呢？——警觉。过了一会儿，斯特里克兰把目光移开，悠闲地扫视着天花板，但是她还在继续凝视着他，这时她的表情就更加无法解释了。

几天以后，斯特里克兰开始下地，他现在只剩下皮包骨头，他的衣服看上去晃里晃荡，就像稻草人身上的破麻袋片。没修剪过的胡须和头发很长，五官本来看上去也总比常人的更大些，现在由于这场病好像更突出，让他显得更不同凡响。他的模样看上去怪怪的，但并不是很丑陋，他别别扭扭的体形给人一种威严伟岸的感觉。我不知道如何准确地描述他给我的印象，很明显，说是精神上的东西也不很确切，虽然屏蔽他精神的肉体好像几乎是透明的，因为在他的脸上有一种粗野的肉欲，而且，尽管这话听上去有些荒诞不经，好像他那种肉欲是精神上的，让人感到好奇。他身上有某种原始的东西，似乎有着大自然不可名状的力量，像是希腊神话中拟人化的，用半人半兽的形状体现出来的东西，诸如半人半兽的森林之神，半人半羊的农牧之神。我还想到了马尔塞亚斯[52]，他被天神活剥了皮，因为他竟敢和天神比赛唱歌。斯特里克兰似乎在心里有着奇怪的和弦，以及尚未试过的曲调，我也能预见到他受尽折磨和深感绝望的结局。我再次感到他被魔鬼附身了，但你又不能说这是邪恶的魔鬼，因为它只是一种原始的力量，在善与恶出现之前就已经存在了。

他依然很虚弱，还不能画画，他就在画室里安静地坐着，时间被阅读或者梦想所占据，但只有上帝才知道他所做的是什么梦。他喜欢看的书也很奇怪，有时我发现他正在细读马拉美[53]的诗歌，阅读的方法像个孩童，一字一句地诵读出声来，我很好奇从那些微妙的韵律和晦涩的诗行中，能唤起他什么样的奇怪情感。有时我发现他沉浸在加博里奥[54]的侦探小说当中，当我想到他对书籍的选择时，我自己都觉得好笑，这种选择充分体现了他稀奇古怪性格中不可调和的方方面面。你能很奇怪地注意到，甚至在他身体还很虚弱的时候，他也没有想到过让自己舒服一点儿。斯特罗伊夫懂得享受，在他的画室里摆放着一对沉重的、装有弹簧垫的扶手椅和一张很大的沙发床。斯特里克兰根本不靠近它们，他可不是故作姿态，好像严格奉行禁欲主义，他就是不喜欢它们。因为有一天我走进画室，就他一个人在，看见他坐在三条腿的凳子上，要不然他也会选择坐在厨房那种没有扶手的椅子上。看见他这样，经常让我很恼火，我从来没见过有人对他周遭的环境如此地漠不关心。





第二十七章


两三周过去了，有天上午，我的写作已经暂时告一段落，我想应该给自己放个假了，于是我去了罗浮宫。我在罗浮宫里闲逛，浏览我已经很熟悉的那些画作，任由我的想象和画作中所蕴含的感情随意嬉戏，我漫步在长长的画廊中，突然看到了斯特罗伊夫的身影。我禁不住微笑了，他的外表，矮矮胖胖，带着随时都会受到惊吓的神色，不能不让人暗自发笑。当我离他更近一些的时候，我发现他似乎十分沮丧，看上去愁眉苦脸的，但还是给人很滑稽的感觉，就像一个人穿着衣服掉进了水里，被人从死亡的边缘救了回来，惊魂未定，让人觉得他看上去就像个傻瓜。他转过身子，两眼盯着我，但我感觉他根本没在看我。在他眼镜后面，一双湛蓝的圆眼睛里露出受尽折磨的神色。

“斯特罗伊夫。”我叫道。

他吓了一跳，随后又笑了一下，可笑容是那么凄惨。

“你干吗失神落魄地在这儿闲逛？”我高兴地问道。

“我好长时间没来罗浮宫了，我想应该来看看他们是否在展览一些新的东西。”

“但是你告诉过我，你在这周必须要画完一幅画的呀。”

“斯特里克兰正在我的画室里画画呢。”

“嗯？”

“是我自己建议他那样做的。他的身体还不够强壮到能回自己的画室里作画。我原来想我们两个人可以一起在那儿作画，在拉丁区很多画家都是共用一间画室的，我觉得这会很有意思。我总是想，如果一个人画累了，有人能一起说说话，一定会是件很快乐的事。”

他说这些话时，说得很慢，每说一个句子就面露尴尬之色地停顿半晌，他用善良的、蠢乎乎的眼睛注视着我，眼里充满了泪水。

“我想我没听懂。”我说道。

“斯特里克兰不能跟别的人一起在画室作画。”

“他妈的，那是你的画室，他应该自己想办法。”

他可怜巴巴地看着我，嘴唇颤抖着。

“到底发生了什么事？”我问道，语气很不客气。

他迟疑了起来，脸也红了，他难过地瞟了一眼墙上的画。

“他不让我继续画画，叫我滚出去。”

“可是你为什么不叫他滚蛋呢？”

“他把我赶出来了，我总不能跟他打架呀，他把我的帽子从我身后扔了出来，然后锁上了门。”

我对斯特里克兰的行为怒火冲天，对迪尔柯也是哀其不幸，怒其不争。因为迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫扮演了这样一个荒诞的角色，让我忍不住想大笑一通。

“你的太太说了什么吗？”

“她出门去市场买东西去了。”

“他会让她进门吗？”

“我不知道。”

我困惑地瞪着斯特罗伊夫，他站在那儿活脱脱就像一个小学生，因为老师发现了他的错误，正在挨训。

“用我替你把他给赶走吗？”我问道。

他吓了一跳，泪光闪闪的脸变得通红。

“可别，你最好什么也别做。”

他冲我点了点头，然后走开了。很明显，出于某种原因，他不想继续讨论这件事了，我感到有些莫名其妙。





第二十八章


一周以后，我的困惑得到了解释。那天晚上，我在一家餐馆像往常一样独自吃完晚饭后，回到我的小公寓，坐在小客厅看书。十点钟左右，门铃喑哑地响了起来。我穿过门廊，打开了门，斯特罗伊夫正站在我的面前。

“我能进来吗？”他问道。

在楼梯口昏暗的灯光下，我看不清他的表情，但是听他的声音不对，让我有些吃惊。我知道他喝酒一向很有节制，否则我会以为他喝醉了。我把他引进我的起居室，让他坐下。

“感谢上帝，我总算找到你了。”他说道。

“出什么事了？”看到他情绪激动，我很吃惊地问他。

现在我能看清楚他了，按理说他平时穿戴得很整齐，但是现在他的衣装不整，看上去突然变得邋里邋遢了。我确信他在来前一直在喝酒。我笑了笑，开始对他的这副模样开起了玩笑。

“我不知道上哪儿好了，”他突然冒了这么一句，“我早些时候来过，但你不在。”

“我今天吃饭晚了。”我说道。

我改变了原来的看法，他并没有喝多，显然酒精不会让他这样如丧考妣。他的脸色通常是红扑扑的，现在奇怪地变成红一块、白一块，双手颤抖着。

“究竟发生了什么事？”我问道。

“我妻子离开我了。”

他都几乎说不成句了，稍微喘息了一会儿，泪水开始沿着圆圆的脸颊流了下来。我不知道说什么好，我最初的想法是，因为斯特罗伊夫对斯特里克兰哈巴狗似的迷恋，让她忍耐的极限到了头，而且被斯特里克兰的冷嘲热讽气昏了头，坚持要把他扫地出门。我知道，虽然斯特罗伊夫太太平时安静、端庄，但她也有脾气爆发的时候。如果斯特罗伊夫一再拒绝她的要求，她可能很容易就会离开画室，而且发誓永不回来。然而，这个小矮胖子是那样的痛苦万分，让我不好意思再取笑他。

“我亲爱的伙计，别那么垂头丧气，她会回来的，当女人在气头上，你不必把她们的话当真。”

“你不明白，她爱上了斯特里克兰。”

“什么！”我大吃一惊，但这想法稍微一过脑子，我就发现它太荒唐了。“你怎么能这么傻呀？你的意思不是说你在吃斯特里克兰的醋吧？”我几乎笑出了声，“你明知她见到他都犯恶心。”

“你不明白。”他呻吟道。

“你这头歇斯底里的蠢驴，”我有点不耐烦地说，“让我给你一杯苏打威士忌吧，喝下去你会好一些的。”

我料想出于这样或那样的原因——只有天知道，人们总是独出心裁地要折磨自己——迪尔柯正在胡思乱想，以为他的妻子在乎斯特里克兰。因为他自己经常犯错冒犯她，所以为了故意气他，她要想方设法地让他疑神疑鬼。

“听我说，”我说，“让我们一起回你的画室吧，如果你自己把事情弄糟了，你就必须自食其果，我陪你去负荆请罪，我绝对相信你妻子不是那种爱记仇的女人。”

“我怎么能回画室呢？”他有气无力地说，“他们在那儿，我把画室留给他们了。”

“这么说来，不是你妻子离开了你，而是你抛弃了你妻子。”

“看在上帝的分上，别这样跟我说话。”

我仍旧不能把他当回事，有一阵子我根本不相信他告诉我的一切。但他真真切切地痛不欲生。

“好吧，你来我这儿是想跟我谈谈这事，你最好原原本本地告诉我整件事的经过。”

“今天下午，我实在不能忍受下去了，我就去跟斯特里克兰讲，我想他的身体已经康复如初了，可以回他自己的住处了，我想要回我自己的画室。”

“世上只有斯特里克兰这种人，才需要人家明明白白地跟他摊牌，”我说，“他怎么说？”

“他笑了笑，你是知道他那种笑法的，好像不是因为他觉得好笑，而是因为你是个该死的傻瓜。他说他马上走，并开始收拾他的东西，你记得我从他的住处拿了一些必需品，我想他会用得上。然后，他向布兰奇要一张纸和绳子，打算打包走了。”

斯特罗伊夫停了下来，大口喘着气，我觉得他快晕过去了。这和我原以为他要告诉我的故事大相径庭。

她的脸色变得十分苍白，但还是拿来了纸和绳子。他什么也没说，一边打着包裹，一边吹着小曲，根本不搭理我们，眼睛里好像带着嘲讽的微笑。我的心像灌了铅一样沉重，我害怕有事情会发生，真希望我没说让他走的那些话就好了。他四下看了看，在找他的帽子。这时她开口说道：

“‘迪尔柯，我要和斯特里克兰一起走，’她说，‘我不能和你再继续生活下去了。’”

“我想开口说话，但说不出话来，斯特里克兰什么也没说，他继续吹着口哨，好像一切跟他无关。”

斯特罗伊夫再次停了下来，用手擦了擦脸。我一直静静地待着。现在我相信他说的话了，而且很震惊，但仍然无法理解。

接下来，他用颤抖的声音，伴随着泪如泉涌，告诉我他如何走到她的跟前，试图把她抱入怀中，但她向后退缩，乞求他不要碰她。他恳求她不要离开他，告诉她自己全身心地爱她，提醒她自己把一切都奉献给了她，说到了他们的生活是多么幸福。他没有对她生气，也不会责怪她的。

“请你让我安静会儿，迪尔柯，”她最后说，“难道你不明白我爱斯特里克兰吗？他去哪儿，我就去哪儿。”

“可是你要明白他绝不会让你幸福的，为了你自己的缘故，还是别走吧，你不明白等待你的会是一条什么样的道路。”

“那是你的错，你坚持要让他来的。”

他又转向了斯特里克兰。

“你可怜可怜她吧，”斯特罗伊夫恳求他说，“你不能让她做出这种疯狂的举动。”

“她可以自己选择，”斯特里克兰说，“我并没强迫她跟我走。”

“我的选择已经定了。”她用生硬的口气说道。

斯特里克兰这种很伤人的平静让斯特罗伊夫失去了最后的自控力。无名的怒火在心中燃烧，他不知道自己要做什么，只是向斯特里克兰扑了过去。斯特里克兰吃了一惊，踉跄地后退了几步，但是他即使大病初愈，也非常强壮。片刻之间，斯特罗伊夫还没明白怎么回事，就发现自己躺在了地上。

“你这个可笑的矬子。”斯特里克兰说道。

斯特罗伊夫从地上爬了起来，他注意到他的妻子站在那儿纹丝不动。在她的面前出尽洋相，更增加了他的羞辱感。他的眼镜在动手中被打掉了，他不能马上看清他们，布兰奇把眼镜捡起来，默默地递给了他。他好像突然意识到了自己的不幸，虽然他知道这样会让自己更加荒唐，但还是忍不住哭了起来。他把脸埋在手掌里。另外两人看着他一言不发，他们甚至没有从所站的地方挪动半步。

“噢，我亲爱的，”他最后呻吟着说，“你怎么能这么残忍？”

“我也控制不了自己，迪尔柯。”她回答道。

“我对你的崇拜超过对所有女人的崇拜。如果我做了什么让你不开心的事情，你为什么不告诉我？我可以改正呀，为了你我可以做任何事情。”

她没有回答，脸紧绷着。他看出来他只能让她讨厌。她穿上外套，戴上帽子，向房门走去。他看到她马上要走了，很快冲到她的跟前，在她的面前跪了下来，紧紧地抓住她的双手，他已经放弃了所有的自尊。

“噢，别走，我亲爱的，没有你我活不下去，我会杀了我自己的。如果我做了什么冒犯你的事，我乞求你的原谅。再给我一次机会吧，我会更加努力让你幸福。”

“起来，迪尔柯，你让自己成了一个十足的傻瓜。”

他摇摇晃晃地站了起来，但还是不让她走。

“你要去哪儿？”他匆忙问道，“你不知道斯特里克兰的住处是什么样子，你不能住在那儿，那地方太可怕了。”

“如果我自己都不在乎，我看不出和你有什么相干。”

“你再多等一分钟，容我把话说完，无论怎样，你不会吝惜这一点时间吧。”

“再说几句又有什么用？我已经下定决心了。无论你说什么也不能让我改变。”

他大口吸着气，把手放到胸口上，为了减轻心脏痛苦的悸动。

“我不是要你改变主意，我只是想让你再听我说几句话，这是我向你请求的最后一件事了，别拒绝我。”

她站住了，用沉思的目光打量了他一会儿，现在她看他的目光是那么的冷漠。她走回画室，斜靠在桌子上。

“说吧。”

斯特罗伊夫费了很大的劲儿，强打精神。

“你必须稍微理智些，你不能靠空气活着。你知道，斯特里克兰没有一分钱。”

“我知道。”

“你会陷入最可怕的贫困当中，连最基本的生活必需品都没法保证。你知道为什么他花了那么长时间才恢复了体力，他都饿得半死了。”

“我可以给他挣些钱花。”

“怎么挣？”

“我不知道，我会找到办法的。”

一个可怕的念头掠过了荷兰人的脑海，他哆嗦了一下。

“我想你一定是疯了，我不知道你中了什么邪。”

她耸了耸肩膀。

“现在我可以走了吗？”

“再等一秒钟。”

他疲惫地环顾他的画室，他曾经那么爱这间屋子，因为她的存在才使它充满了欢乐和家的感觉。他把眼睛闭上了一小会儿，然后，他长时间地凝望她，好像要把她的形象印在心里。他站起身来，拿上帽子。

“不，还是我走吧。”

“你走？”

她吓了一跳，不知道他是什么意思。

“想到你会住到那间可怕的、肮脏的阁楼，我无法忍受。毕竟，这儿是我的家，也是你的家。在这儿你会住得舒服些，至少你不会忍饥挨饿。”

他走向了他一直放钱的抽屉，拿了几张钞票。

“我想我给你留下一半我的钱。”

他把抽屉里的一半钱放在桌子上，斯特里克兰和斯特罗伊夫的妻子都没有说话。

然后，他又收拾了别的一些东西。

“你能帮我把我的衣服打包，再把它们交给门房吗？我明天会来取它们的。”他想挤出点微笑，“再见，我亲爱的。我很感激你在过去给我的幸福时光。”

他走了出去，并随手带上门。在想象中，我看到斯特里克兰把他的帽子扔在一张桌子上，随后坐下来，点上一支香烟。





第二十九章


我沉默了一会儿，脑子里想着斯特罗伊夫告诉我的这些事。我无法忍受他的懦弱，他也看出了我对他这一点很不以为然。

“你和我一样清楚斯特里克兰是怎样生活的，”他声音颤抖地说，“我不能让她住在那样的环境里——我绝对不能。”

“那是你的事。”我回答道。

“要换作你，你会怎么办？”他问道。

“她本来就应该睁着眼睛走路。如果她不得不忍受这些注定的不便，那是她自作自受。”

“我承认你说得对。但是，你知道，她不是你的爱人，你才会这样说。”

“你还爱她吗？”

“哦，比以往更爱了。斯特里克兰不是一个能让女人幸福的人。这事持续不了多久，我想让她知道我不会放弃她的。”

“那就是说，你还准备让她回来？”

“我一点儿也不犹豫，因为她会比过去更需要我。当她一个人受尽了屈辱，心都碎了的时候，如果没地方可去，那该多可怕呀。”

他似乎不再怨恨了。他这个样子我已经司空见惯了，正是因为这一点让我对他缺乏男人的血性有点生气。也许他也猜到了我的想法，所以他说：

“我不能指望她像我爱她那样去爱我。我是一个小丑，不是那种能让女人爱上的男人。我一直能明确的一点是，如果她爱上了斯特里克兰，我不能责怪她。”

“我还没见过比你更没有自尊心的男人呢。”我说道。

“我爱她胜过了我自己。在我看来，如果爱中还混杂着自尊心，似乎只是因为你最爱的是自己。不管怎么说，一个已婚的男人会移情别恋，这种事经常发生，激情一过，他终究会回到他妻子身边，她能让他回头，并再次接纳他，每个人都认为这是很自然的事。如果男人可以得到这种待遇，为什么女人就该是例外呢？”

“我敢说，这倒是很合逻辑，”我微笑着说，“但是大多数的男人都不会这么想，他们无法接纳出轨的妻子。”

然而，当我这么和斯特罗伊夫谈话时，我对整个事情的突如其来，还是多少有些疑惑。无法想象他事先没有警觉。我还记得我在布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫眼中看到的奇怪的神色，也许它能解释，她已经隐隐约约意识到了心中不断增加的情愫，这种感情让她很吃惊，自己也被吓着了。

“在今天以前，你就从没怀疑过他们之间有问题吗？”我问道。

他没有立刻答话。桌上有支铅笔，他拿起来随手在吸墨纸上画了一个头像。

“请你随便说吧，如果你不喜欢我向你发问的话。”我说道。

“我把话说出来还好受些。哦，如果你明白我心中可怕的痛苦的话，”他把铅笔一扔，“是的，我已经知道两周了，我在她意识到之前就知道了。”

“那你为什么不把斯特里克兰打发走？”

“我自己都无法相信，这似乎是不可能的。她都不愿看他一眼，真是意想不到，简直难以置信。我刚开始以为自己只是出于嫉妒，你是知道的，我这人一直挺爱嫉妒，但是我自己训练自己，绝不能表现出来。我对她认识的每一个人都嫉妒，我甚至还嫉妒过你。我知道她并不像我爱她那样爱我，这也很正常，不是吗？但是她能允许我爱她，这就足够让我幸福的了。为了让他们单独待在一起，我迫使自己好几个小时出去闲逛。我这样做是为了惩罚自己，因为这种疑神疑鬼贬低了我的品格。等我回来时，我感觉他们不想让我回来——倒不是斯特里克兰，我在不在，对他来说无所谓。而是布兰奇，我去亲吻她时，她浑身一哆嗦。最后，我都不知道自己该怎么办了。我知道如果我大吵大闹，他们只会嘲笑我。我觉得如果我闭嘴不说，假装没看见，一切可能会相安无事。我下定决心把他平平静静地打发走，不能有争吵。噢，如果你能知道我所受的痛苦就好了！”

接着他又告诉了我一遍他如何让斯特里克兰离开。他很小心地挑选合适的时机，努力让他的要求听起来是随口一说的。但是他无法控制声音的颤抖，他自己都觉得虽然他想尽量把话说得快活和友好，可话音中充满了酸酸的醋劲儿。他没有想到自己一说，斯特里克兰就同意了，开始收拾东西准备走。最让他意想不到的是，他的妻子也决定和斯特里克兰一起走。我现在看出来了，他真心地希望当时能管住嘴不说。他宁可选择嫉妒的折磨，也不愿忍受和他妻子分离的痛苦。

“我想杀了他，我只会做傻事，让自己像个傻瓜。”

他沉默了很长时间，接着又说了起来，我知道那些话一直郁积在他的心头。

“如果我只是耐心等待，也许不会发生后面这些事的。我真应该多些耐心的。哦，可怜的布兰奇，我把她都逼成什么样了？”

我耸了耸肩，但没吱声。我对布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫没什么同情，但如果告诉可怜的迪尔柯我对她的真实看法，只会徒增他的痛苦。

当他不住嘴地说的时候，其实已经到了筋疲力尽的阶段了。他控制不住自己，把当时的场景，每个人说的话，又一遍遍地复述。一会儿想起有什么还没告诉我，赶紧说一遍；一会儿又想跟我讨论，哪些话他该说，哪些话他不该说。他为自己的睁眼瞎而悲叹，一会儿后悔他做了这件事，一会儿又自责没去做那件事。时间越来越晚了，最后，我也同他一样疲惫不堪了。

“你现在打算做什么？”我最后说道。

“我还能做什么呀？我只能等，直到她把我招呼回去。”

“为什么你不到外地去散散心呢？”

“不行，不行，我必须在这儿候着，她什么时候需要我了，我就在附近。”

对于目前的状况，他似乎完全不知怎么办好了，根本没有计划。当我建议他应该上床休息了，他说睡不着；他想出去，在大街上溜达直到天亮。显然，他这种状态，我不能让他一个人独自行动。我说服他晚上就跟我待在一起，安排他睡我的床。在起居室里，我有一张沙发床，在上面我也能睡得很舒服。在我的坚持下，他现在已经彻底没有力气抗拒我的提议了。我给他服了足量的佛罗那[55]，让他可以人事不省地睡上几个小时，我想这是我能给他的最大帮助了。





第三十章


然而，我给自己准备的这张床并不像我料想的那样足够舒服，所以整个晚上我几乎没能睡着，脑海里满是这个不幸的荷兰人跟我说的那些话。我对布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫的行为并不感到有多么奇怪，因为我已经看出来她的出轨仅仅是肉体渴求的结果。我并不认为她曾经真正地关心过自己的丈夫，原来我以为她爱他，其实那只不过是对于舒适和爱抚出自女性本能的反应，大多数女人都把这种反应当成了爱情。这是一种被动的感情，能够被任何东西所唤醒，就像藤蔓可以攀附于任何树上一样。这种感情可以让一个姑娘嫁给任何一个想要她的男人，而且保证能够随之爱上他，世人都认可这种感情的力量，并且觉得这种方式是明智的。这是一种对安全的满足、对家业的骄傲、对被艳羡的喜悦、对家庭生活的满意所组成的感情，它只是被友善的虚荣所掩饰，而女人们还把它归因于精神上的价值。它是一种在激情面前会丧失抵抗力的感情。我怀疑甚至在一开始，布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫对斯特里克兰强烈的憎恶感中就隐隐约约掺杂着性吸引力的因素。可我又有何德何能，我应该去寻求解开这神秘的性的难题吗？也许斯特罗伊夫的激情唤起了，但没有满足她本性中的那个部分，她恨斯特里克兰是因为她觉得在他的身上有某种力量，正是她所需要的。我认为在她极力反对她丈夫想把斯特里克兰接到家里的愿望时，她并非虚情假意。虽然她不知道为什么，但她怕他。我还记得清清楚楚，她预见到了灾难的降临。我莫名其妙地感觉到，她对斯特里克兰的恐惧是对自己的恐惧的移植，因为他是那么奇怪地困扰她。他的外表狂野和粗俗，眼睛里透着冷漠，嘴唇上显着肉欲，身材高大、壮硕；他给人一种热情不羁的印象，也许她也感到了在他的身上有种邪恶的气质，这种气质是世界仍在混沌初期野蛮人身上所具有的，那时物质还和大地保持着早期的联系，而物质似乎还拥有自身的精神。如果他完全影响了她，她就不可避免地或是爱他或是恨他，她选择了后者。

随后，我能想象到每天和病人的亲密接触，奇怪地打动了她。她抬起他的头喂他食物，他的头给她的手以沉重感；喂完他后，她擦拭他充满肉欲的嘴唇和红胡须。她擦洗他的四肢，上面覆盖着浓密的汗毛；在她擦干他双手的时候，虽然他很虚弱，但双手依然结实，筋骨有力。他的手指很长，典型的艺术家的手指，多才多艺，灵巧别致。我不知道这些手指激起了她多么慌乱的想法。他很安静地睡着，没有一丝的动作，好像他已经死去。他就像森林中的某种野兽，在长时间的追逐后静静地歇息。她想知道在他的梦中会有怎样的景象。他梦到仙女飞越希腊的森林，而森林之神在后面紧追吗？她在逃跑，脚底生风，绝望无助，而他一步步地赶了上来，直到她感觉到了脖子后面热乎乎的呼吸。她还在一声不吭地逃，他也在默默地追，最后当他抓住她时，激荡在她心中的，是恐惧还是狂喜？

布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫被欲念残酷地抓在了掌心。也许她还恨斯特里克兰，但是她更加渴望得到他，原来构成她生活的全部现在都变得无足轻重。她不再是那个复杂的女人了，既善良又爱使性子，既体贴又轻率，她是狂女美娜德[56]，是欲女。

但可能这只是我的想象。她或许只是厌倦了她的丈夫，出于并不热切的好奇而来到斯特里克兰身边，她或许对他并没有什么特别的感情，屈从于他的欲念只是由于他们的朝夕相处和她的闲散无聊，随后却发现她掉进了自己设计的陷阱里，根本没有力量挣脱。我怎么能了解在她平和的前额和那双冷静的灰眼睛后面，隐藏着什么样的想法和感情呢？

但是如果人这种生物是不可捉摸的，人们就无法确定别人的言行。所以，在布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫身上，她的行为还是完全可以解释通的。而在另一方面，我却无法理解斯特里克兰的做法了，我绞尽脑汁也想不通，他的所作所为和我对他的了解和认知背道而驰。他如此冷酷地背叛朋友的信任，无耻地满足自己一时的念头，不惜以别人的痛苦为代价，这些都毫不奇怪，因为他的本性就是如此，他是一个没有一丝一毫感恩之心的人，也没有任何的同情心。我们大多数人司空见惯的那些感情，在他身上根本不存在，如果你去指责他毫无感情，就会像因为老虎的残暴而去指责老虎一样荒唐。但我还是不能理解他怎么会打起了斯特罗伊夫太太的主意。

我无法相信斯特里克兰会爱上布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫，我不相信他还有爱的能力，这是一种以温柔为重要特质的感情，但是斯特里克兰无论是对他自己还是对别的人都没有温柔之情。爱情中需要有一种柔弱之感，需要有一种去保护的愿望，渴望展现好的一面和给予对方快乐—如果不是无私，那么无论如何也是一种千方百计要掩盖起来的自私；爱情有时还会缺乏自信。我无法想象在斯特里克兰身上会有这些特点。爱情需要专注，需要恋人完全忘我；即使是最远见卓识的人，虽然在理性上清楚，但在感性上也不会认识到爱情会有消亡的一天；明知爱情是虚幻的，是一场镜花水月，但实践上仍坚信爱情是具象的，他爱这场虚幻胜过现实。爱情可以使一个人超越自己，同时还可使人钻牛角尖而不能自拔，他不再是原来的自我，他不再是一个个人，而是一件东西，一个工具，在陌生的自我中要达到某种目的。恋爱时绝不会缺乏卿卿我我、多愁善感，而在我所认识的人中，斯特里克兰是最缺乏这种感情的。我不相信他会忍受爱情所带来的折磨，他也绝不会忍受爱情带给他的束缚。我相信他有能力把爱情这玩意儿从心底连根拔除的，虽然可能也会带来痛苦，让他留下满目疮痍、血流满地的场面，但却可以留住他自己也不知道是什么的、无法让人理解的、孜孜以求的东西。如果我完全成功地写下了斯特里克兰给我留下的复杂印象的话，我想我对他下面的评价不会显得唐突：我觉得他既伟大又渺小，爱情是不会发生在他身上的。

然而，我认为每个人对于爱情的理解来源于其自身的特质，因人而异。像斯特里克兰这样的人会按照自己特殊的方式去恋爱，想寻求对他感情的分析是徒劳的。





第三十一章


第二天，虽然我一再挽留斯特罗伊夫，他还是离开了。我提议我去给他取画室里的东西，可他坚持自己去。我想他可能希望他们没有想到把他的东西归置到一起，这样他兴许还有机会能再次见到他妻子，进而还有可能劝说她回到他身边。但是，他回到家后发现，他的一些随身行李[57]已经放在门房的小屋中等着他拿走，而且门房告诉他说布兰奇已经出门了。我想斯特罗伊夫抵制不了倾诉的诱惑，一股脑儿把他的麻烦事向门房述说。我后来确实也发现他跟他所认识的每一个人都倾诉，他期待能得到同情，结果只激起了他们的嘲笑。

他也光做些有失体面的事。他清楚他妻子购物的时间，一天，终于控制不住想见她的愿望，在街上拦住了她。她不想跟他说话，可他坚持要跟她谈谈。他仓促而结结巴巴地说了一些道歉的话，为自己对她做过的错事而乞求原谅；告诉她自己是真心实意地爱着她，恳求她回到自己身边。她没有回答，匆匆地赶路，并把脸扭到一边。我能够想象得到斯特罗伊夫迈动他那小胖腿努力赶上她的步伐，匆忙中一边喘着粗气，一边告诉她自己现在多么悲惨，乞求她可怜可怜他。他承诺，如果她能原谅他，他会为她做任何事。他提出带她出门旅行，告诉她斯特里克兰很快就会厌倦她。当他向我没完没了地重复这一幕令人作呕的场景时，我简直气炸了肺。他表现得既无理智又无尊严。凡是叫他妻子鄙视他的事情，他简直一件也没落下。女人对一个仍然爱着她，可是她已经不再爱的男人可以表现得比任何人都残忍；她那时不再善良，甚至不再容忍，只有被刺激起来的疯狂，布兰奇突然停下了脚步，用尽全力扇了她丈夫一个大耳光，然后利用他愣神的空当抽身，跑到通向画室的楼梯上，整个过程一言不发。

当他向我叙述这一切时，手放在脸颊上，好像还在体味那一巴掌的滋味；眼睛里露出痛苦和迷惘的神色，那痛苦让人心软，那迷惘让人感到滑稽可笑。他就像一个受了重罚的小学生，虽然我很为他难过，但还是忍不住哈哈大笑。

接下来的日子里，他在她购物必经的街道上踯躅，有时会站在拐角处，在她经过的时候，在一旁默默注视。他不敢再跟她说话了，但是希望把内心的呼唤用他那对圆圆的眼睛表露出来。我猜想他有某种想法，希望她能看见他悲惨的样子，而后打动她。但是她绝对没有表现出她看到了他的丝毫痕迹，也根本没有改变她出行的时间和路线。我觉得在她的冷漠中有某种残忍，也许她从所施加给斯特罗伊夫的折磨中得到了快感，我真不明白为什么她对他恨之入骨。

我苦口婆心地劝斯特罗伊夫行为举止要理智和得体些，他的这种没骨气的窝囊劲儿只能使事情变得更糟。

“你这样下去根本于事无补，”我说，“依我看，如果你能劈头盖脸打她一顿，才显得你更明智。她就不会像现在这样对你瞧不上眼了。”

我建议他回家乡去待上一段时间。他经常跟我谈起他的家乡——荷兰北部某个地区一座安静的小镇，现在他父母还居住在那里。他们家不富裕，父亲是个木匠，一家人住在一座古老的红色墙砖的小屋中，整洁干净，旁边一条运河缓缓地流过。小镇的街道宽阔和空旷。两百多年来，这个地方渐渐走向消亡，但栋栋房屋还保持着当年朴实而雄伟的模样。过去富商们把货物运送到遥远的东印度群岛之后，就会在这里过着宁静和优裕的生活。如今虽然往昔的风光不再，在走向衰败的过程中，他们仍然保持着辉煌岁月的优雅。你能够沿着运河徜徉，直到你来到广阔的绿色田野，这里随处可见散落的风车，还有黑白相间的牛群，在懒洋洋地吃着草。我想身处在这样的环境，再带着童年时的回忆，迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫会忘了他的不幸。但是，他不愿回去。

“当她需要我时，我必须在这儿，”他反复说，“如果有什么可怕的事情发生，而我又不在她身边的话，这事不敢想象。”

“你觉得会发生什么事？”我问道。

“我不知道，但我害怕。”

我耸了耸肩。

尽管这样痛苦不堪，迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫仍然让人觉得好笑。如果他憔悴些和消瘦些兴许还会激起人们的同情，可他偏偏不是这类人，他依旧胖胖的，他圆圆的红脸蛋就像熟透的苹果般闪亮。他过去穿戴很讲究，现在还继续穿着整齐的黑外套，戴着圆顶礼帽，但帽子总是比他的大脑袋小一号，但仍不失一副衣冠楚楚、踌躇满志的样子；还是大腹便便，悲伤在他身上没有体现出任何效果，他看上去比以往更像一个发了横财的商人。一个人的外表和他的灵魂如此地不匹配实在是件很苦恼的事。迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫有着罗密欧[58]一样的激情，却生就了一副托比·培尔契爵士[59]的皮囊。他的天性温柔和慷慨，然而却总是把事情搞砸；他能真正领略美的东西，一旦搞起创作，又只能归于平庸；他有着特殊的细腻感情，外表却很粗俗；处理别人的事情时，很有策略，处理自己的事情时，却往往束手无策。造化弄人呀，她把那么多相互矛盾的元素捏合到一个人身上，并让他直面宇宙的无情时茫然失措，好像开了一个残酷而又现实的玩笑。





第三十二章


我有好几个星期没见到斯特里克兰了，我实在是讨厌他，如果有机会，我会很开心告诉他这一点，但我也犯不上为了这个目的而到处找他。我还是有点羞于假装道德卫士，义愤填膺地去指责别人。但这里面总有点自鸣得意的成分，好像在让一个有幽默感的人感到很难堪。除非我真的动起火来，我是不肯让别人拿自己当笑话看的。在斯特里克兰身上有种与生俱来的擅于冷嘲热讽的东西，这样使我对任何故作姿态的言行都很小心谨慎。

但是有一天晚上，当我路过克里舍大街时，在那家斯特里克兰经常光顾而我现在尽量回避的咖啡馆前，冷不丁和他打了个照面。他身旁有布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫相陪，正要走向斯特里克兰最常落座的角落。

“这段日子你他妈的跑哪儿去了？”他说，“我还以为你离开巴黎了呢。”

这种套近乎的方式正好证明了他很清楚我不想跟他讲话，他这种人也不值得花时间跟他讲什么礼貌。

“不，”我说，“我没走。”

“那为什么在这儿见不到你了？”

“在巴黎不止有一家咖啡馆，无论在哪家咖啡馆都可以打发闲散时光。”

这时布兰奇伸出手来，跟我说了句“晚上好”寒暄的话。我不知道为什么我原以为她会有某种改变，而事实上，她还是穿着她过去常穿的那件灰衣服，整洁、合体，前额光洁，眼神平静，就跟我以前见她在画室里忙家务时一模一样。

“来下一盘棋吧。”斯特里克兰说道。

不知道为什么我当时没有想到任何借口拒绝，我一脸不高兴地跟着他们走到斯特里克兰常坐的那张桌旁，他要了棋盘和棋子。他们两人对于这次的不期而遇没有任何大惊小怪，我也只能装作若无其事的样子。斯特罗伊夫太太带着神秘莫测的神情观察着棋局，一言不发，过去她也总是寡言少语。我看着她的嘴角，想找出能够流露她心境的线索；我观察着她的眼睛，想探查某种讲述的目光，隐含着沮丧或是凄苦；我打量她的前额，想发现表明感情已经流逝的皱纹。但她的脸就像戴着面具，什么表情也没有。她的双手一动不动地放在膝盖上，一只手松松地握着另一只手。从我听到的一些事我知道她是个性情暴烈的女人，她在街上曾给了迪尔柯恶狠狠的一记耳光，而这个男人过去是那么全心全意地爱着她，这说明她喜怒无常、冷酷无情。她抛弃了在她丈夫庇护下的温暖安全的家，抛弃了衣食无忧、舒适安逸的生活，奔向她自己也能看得清的极其危险的境地。这一切表明她渴望冒险，即使过紧巴巴的日子也在所不惜，后一点从她照料家务，喜爱做一个好的家庭主妇上看一点也不足为奇。她是一个性格复杂的女人，她的性格和她娴静端庄的外表形成了鲜明的对比。

我被这次相遇也搞得心情激动，虽然脑海中思潮翻滚，但我还是想法把注意力集中到我正下的这盘棋上来，每次下棋，我总是千方百计要下赢斯特里克兰，因为他是一个对落败的对手总是很鄙视的玩家；他获胜后的兴高采烈、得意扬扬总是使失败的一方更加难以忍受。而另一方面，如果他下输了，他倒是能心情不错地坦然处之，在下棋方面，他是一个不错的输家，糟糕的赢家。有人认为只有在下棋的时候，才能最清楚地观察一个人的性格，这倒是可以从斯特里克兰的例子上得到些许微妙的推论。

当我们下完棋的时候，我叫来侍者付了账，然后就离开了。这场会面没出现什么戏剧性场面，没有一句话让我玩味，没有什么结论让我肯定地得出。这反而勾起了我的好奇心。我不明白他们如何相处，但凡有可能，我宁愿灵魂出窍，化身成精灵去窥探他们在画室单独相处时，做了些什么，又说了些什么。总而言之，尽管我充分发挥了想象力，但到头来还是一头雾水。





第三十三章


两三天后，迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫又登门拜访了我。

“我听说你见了布兰奇了。”他说道。

“你究竟从哪儿得到的消息？”

“有人告诉我，说看见你和他们坐在一起，你为什么不告诉我？”

“我想要是告诉了你，只会让你更受伤。”

“伤了我又能怎样？你得知道，有关她的最微不足道的事情我也想听。”

我做好了他开始向我发问的准备。

“她看上去怎么样呀？”他问道。

“一点儿也没变。”

“她看上去幸福吗？”

我耸了耸肩。

“我怎么知道？我们在咖啡馆里，当时我跟斯特里克兰正在下棋，我根本没机会跟她说话。”

“哦，但是你从她的脸上看不出来吗？”

我摇了摇头，只能再次重复她没有说一句话，没有做出一个能暗示的姿势表明她的感情。他应该比我更清楚她的自控能力是多么的强大，他情绪激动地紧握双手。

“啊，我真是害怕，我知道一定会出事，一定会出可怕的事，而我无法阻止。”

“会出什么事？”我问道。

“噢，我不知道。”他呻吟道，一边用双手把头紧紧抱住，“我预见到某种可怕的灾难即将发生。”

斯特罗伊夫一向情绪容易激动，现在简直有些精神失常，已经失去了理智。我想很可能布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫会无法忍受和斯特里克兰继续生活下去，但是最虚假的一句格言说什么“自作自受”，可生活的经验告诉我，人们不断地去做注定会导致灾难的事情，然而总有机会能够让他们成功躲过因他们的错误所造成的结果。当布兰奇和斯特里克兰吵了架之后，她只能不得不离开他，而她的丈夫还在谦卑地等着她，打算原谅并忘记她所做的一切。而我对她是不准备给予多少同情的。

“你知道，爱她的人不是你呀。”斯特罗伊夫说道。

“不管怎么说，我们没法证明她是不幸的，我们所知道的是，他们也许会安顿下来，过上跟大多数夫妇一样的家庭生活。”

斯特罗伊夫用他那对愁苦的眼睛看了我一眼。

“当然，这跟你没任何关系，但对我来说，这至关重要，甚至是生死攸关。”

如果我当时表现得不耐烦或者心不在焉，是有点对不住斯特罗伊夫的。

“你愿意帮我做点事吗？”斯特罗伊夫问道。

“当然愿意。”

“你能为我给布兰奇写封信吗？”

“你自己为什么不写？”

“我一封又一封地给她写信，我没指望她会回信，我想她甚至都没读那些信。”

“你没考虑到女人的好奇心吗？你认为她能抵抗得住读信的诱惑吗？”

“她能——至少对我的信，她能。”

我快速地看了他一眼。他低下了眼帘，他的这句回答在我看来有种奇怪的低三下四的感觉。他意识到，她对待他是如此的冷漠和不屑一顾，看见他的笔迹激不起她任何的好奇心。

“你真的相信她还会回到你身边吗？”我问道。

“我想让她知道，如果事情糟到了不可收拾的地步，她还能指望我。这就是我想让你告诉她的。”

我拿过来一张纸。

“你究竟让我写些什么呢？”

下面就是我写的内容：

亲爱的斯特罗伊夫太太：

迪尔柯希望我转告你，如果任何时候你需要他，他都会因能有为你效劳的机会而不胜感激的。他没有因为所发生的事对你怀恨在心，他对你的爱没有丝毫改变。在下述地址你总是会找到他的。





第三十四章


然而，虽然我和斯特罗伊夫一样坚信，斯特里克兰和布兰奇之间的关系会走向灾难性的结局，我却没有料到事情是以一种悲剧的形式收场。夏天到了，天气湿热难耐，让人喘不上气来，甚至到了晚上也没有任何凉爽能让人缓解一下厌倦的神经。被阳光普照的街道似乎把大白天炙烤的热气又返还了回来，行人拖着疲惫的双腿在街道上蹒跚而行。我又有好几个星期没有见到斯特里克兰了，时间和精力被别的事情所占据，所以没有再想他和他的那些事。迪尔柯，总是带着他徒劳的悲伤，也开始让我厌烦了，所以我也尽量回避着他。他的事也够让人败兴了，我不想在他的麻烦中卷入更深。

一天上午，我正坐在房间里写作，身上还穿着睡衣。我的思绪在漫游，我想到了布列塔尼阳光明媚的海滩，还有大海的清新。身边放着门房给我端来的盛咖啡牛奶[60]的空碗和一小块吃剩下的羊角面包[61]。我胃口不太好，没有吃完。隔壁房间里，门房正在放掉我浴缸中的水。这时，门铃突然响了起来，我让门房先去开门，一会儿我就听见斯特罗伊夫的声音问我是否在家。我没有站起身，大声招呼他进来，他很快地走进房间，走近我坐的桌子旁。

“她自杀了。”他声音嘶哑地说道。

“你说什么？”我吓了一大跳，大声喊道。

他动了动嘴唇，好像在说话，可根本没有声音发出来。他像个白痴一样，叽里咕噜地说了一通。我的心都快跳出胸膛，不知为什么，我突然冒起火来。

“看在上帝的分上，你稳住点神，伙计，”我说，“你刚才究竟说了些什么？”

他用双手做了几下绝望的姿势，但是嘴里还是没有说出话来。他可能遭受打击变成了哑巴。我不知道我是怎么了，我抓住他的肩膀用力摇晃他。现在回想起来，我为自己像个傻子似的举动感到恼火，我猜想可能是连续几个晚上没有休息好，让我的神经也在不知不觉中快要崩溃了。

“让我坐下来。”他上气不接下气地说道。

我给他倒了一杯圣加尔米尔[62]矿泉水让他喝下去，我把水杯端到他的嘴边，就像在喂一个孩子。他一饮而尽，有些洒在他T恤衫的前襟上。

“谁自杀了？”

我不知道我为什么这样问，因为我显然知道他指的是谁。他努力定了定神，恢复了常态。

“他们昨晚吵了一架，他离家出走了。”

“她死了吗？”

“没有，他们把她送到了医院。”

“那你究竟在说些什么？”我不耐烦地喊道，“为什么你要说她自杀了？”

“别跟我嚷嚷，如果你这样跟我讲话，我什么都跟你讲不清楚。”

我紧握双拳，想控制住我的怒火，我努力摆出一副笑脸来。

“对不起，不着急，慢慢说，你是好样的。”

他的那双在眼镜后面的圆圆的蓝眼睛惊恐万状，他戴的放大镜片又扭曲了它们。

“今天早上门房上楼送信，按门铃后，里面没人回答。可她听见有人在里面呻吟。门没有锁，她就进去了。布兰奇正躺在床上，她的状况很不好，桌子上放着一瓶草酸。”

斯特罗伊夫用双手蒙住脸，一边前后摇晃着身体，一边呻吟。

“她的意识还清醒吗？”

“是的，哦，如果你知道她遭了怎样的罪就好了，我真受不了了，受不了了。”

他变得声嘶力竭起来。

“他妈的，你有什么受不了的，”我不耐烦地喊，“她自作自受。”

“你怎么能这样残忍？”

“你都做了些什么？”

“他们叫了医生，也通知了我，还报了警。我已经给了门房二十个法郎，告诉她如果有什么事，就马上派人告诉我。”

他停顿了有一分钟之久，我看得出来，他下面不得不告诉我的话是很难启齿的。

“当我过去的时候，她还是不跟我说话，她告诉他们让我走开。我发誓说我原谅了她所做的一切，但她不听我说。她还试图把头往墙上撞。医生跟我说我不能和她待在一起。她也不停地说：‘让他走开！’我走开了，一个人在画室里干等着。随后救护车来了，他们把她抬到担架上，他们让我躲到厨房里，以免让她知道我还在屋里。”

我一边穿衣服——因为斯特罗伊夫希望我和他一起立即去医院——他一边告诉我他已经为他妻子安排了单间病房，这样她至少可以不用住进空气污浊、人员混杂的大病房。在我们去的路上，他又向我解释了希望我去的原因；如果她仍然拒绝见他，也许她会同意见我。他恳求我去反复跟她解释，他依旧爱着她，他不会责备她一个字的，只是渴望能够帮助她，他对她没有别的企图，在她好了以后，绝不劝说她回到他的身边，她完全是自由的。

但是，当我们到达医院的时候，发现这是一栋孤零零、毫无生气的建筑，仅仅看上一眼都会使人心里憋得慌。我们被人从一间办公室支到另一间办公室，爬过无数的楼梯，穿过长长的、空旷的走廊之后，终于找到了负责病人的大夫，他告诉我们病人的病情很重，当天不能见任何人。这个大夫是个小个子，蓄着胡须，穿着白大褂，态度很生硬。很显然他把病人就看作一个个病例，而把焦急的家属们看成讨厌的麻烦事，必须强硬地公事公办。而且，对他来说，这事太平常了，不过是一个歇斯底里的女人和她的情人吵了一架，服了毒，这种事每天都在不断地发生。刚开始的时候，他以为迪尔柯就是制造这场灾难的罪魁祸首，对他声色俱厉，态度很不好。当我解释说，他只是那个憋屈的丈夫，急切地想原谅出轨的妻子以后，这个大夫突然用一种探寻的目光，很好奇地打量他。我似乎看到了目光后面揶揄的意味。倒也不假，斯特罗伊夫确实长着一副受欺骗丈夫的窝囊相。大夫微微地耸了耸肩。

“暂时还没有生命危险。”他说道，算是回答了我们的问题，“我们还不知道她到底服了多少，也许经过一场虚惊，她会好起来的。女人们总是没完没了地为了爱情自杀，但通常她们又会小心翼翼地让自杀不成功，一般情况下，她们只是摆出一种姿态让她们的情人怜惜或者害怕罢了。”

在他的口吻中有一种冷漠的蔑视，对他而言，很显然布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫只是当年在巴黎企图自杀的一个案例，作为一个数字仅仅加在统计表中就够了。他很忙，不能在我们身上浪费更多的时间了，他告诉我们，如果在第二天的某个时候来，也许布兰奇会好一些的，这样她的丈夫就有可能见见她。





第三十五章


我都几乎不知道我们怎么挨过的那一天。斯特罗伊夫不能忍受一个人落单，我自己在想方设法分散他注意力的努力中也搞得筋疲力尽。我带他到罗浮宫，他假装在看画，但我看得出他的思想一刻也没离开他的妻子。我强迫他吃点东西，午饭之后，我又劝他躺下休息，但他根本没睡着。他乐意接受我的邀请来我的公寓住几天，我给了他一些书让他读，可读不了一两页，他就会把书放下，满眼愁苦地盯着空中愣神。在晚上，我们玩了无数局的皮克牌。为了不让我的努力白费而使我产生失望之感，他强打起精神，好像玩得津津有味的样子。最后我给他喝了口安眠药水，尽管睡得不踏实，但他总算进入了梦乡。

当我们再次去医院的时候，我们找到了一位护士，她告诉我们布兰奇似乎有了一点好转。随后她走进病房问病人是否愿意见她丈夫，我们听见在她住的房间传出了声音，一会儿护士出来告诉我们，病人不想见任何人。我们事先已经告诉护士，如果她拒绝见迪尔柯的话，再问问她是否愿意见我，但是她也拒绝见我。迪尔柯的嘴唇颤抖着。

“我不敢太强求了，”护士说，“她太虚弱了，也许过个一两天她会改变主意的。”

“有她想见的别的什么人吗？”迪尔柯问道，他的声音低得几乎成了耳语。

“她说她只想一个人静静地待着。”

迪尔柯的双手奇怪地动着，好像两只手跟身体没什么关系，只是自己不自觉地晃动着。

“你能去告诉她，如果她想见别的什么人的话，我会把他带来吗？我只希望她能幸福。”

护士用她那宁静、善良的眼睛看着他，这双眼睛已经见惯了世间的所有恐惧和痛苦，但是眸中也充满了没有罪恶世界的幻景，所以保持着宁静和安详。

“她稍微冷静下来以后，我会告诉她的。”

迪尔柯心里充满了悲悯和怜爱，恳求护士马上把这个口信带给布兰奇。

“这可能会治好她的，我乞求您现在就去问吧。”

带着一丝同情的微笑，护士又转身走进了病房。我们听到了她压低的声音，随后，我听到了一个辨认不出的声音回答道：

“不，不，不。”

护士再次出来，摇了摇头。

“刚才说话的是她吗？”我问道，“她的声音听上去怎么那么奇怪？”

“好像她的声带被草酸烧坏了。”

迪尔柯发出了一声压抑的哀号。我让他先走，在医院入口处等着我，因为我还想跟护士说几句话。他什么也没问，一声不吭地走了。他似乎完全失去了意志力，就像一个听话的孩子。

“她告诉过你她为什么要这么做吗？”我问道。

“没有，她不想说话，静静地仰面躺着，好几个小时都一动不动。但她一直在流泪，枕头都湿透了。她太虚弱了，用不了手绢，任泪水在脸庞滑落。”

这番话让我的心弦突然一紧，当时我恨不得立马杀了斯特里克兰，当我和护士说再见的时候，我知道自己的声音也在颤抖。

我发现迪尔柯正在台阶上等我，他的眼神很茫然，好像什么也没看见，直到我碰了碰他的胳膊，才注意到我已经来到他身旁。我们默默地并肩走着，我在努力想象究竟发生了什么，逼得布兰奇这个可怜的人走了这么可怕的一步。我料想斯特里克兰已经知道布兰奇出了事，因为警察局肯定已经派人找过他了，他也一定做了陈述。我不知道他现在在哪儿，我猜他已经回到了那间做他画室的破败的阁楼。很奇怪她并不希望见到他，也许她拒绝让人叫他来，是因为她清楚他不会来的。我想知道，她看到了什么样的一个残酷的无底深渊，在恐惧和绝望之中，她才不想再活下去了。





第三十六章


接下来的一周也很糟糕，斯特罗伊夫一天要去两次医院打听他妻子的情况，她仍然拒绝见他。开始的时候他能松一口气，满怀希望地离开，因为院方告诉他，她的病情似乎正在好转。可随后，他又陷入绝望之中，因为医生最担心的并发症果然发生了，恢复的希望变得渺茫。那位护士虽然对他的痛苦充满同情，但也没有什么话可以安慰他。那个可怜的女人安静地躺着，不想说话，眼睛直勾勾的，好像她正在看着即将到来的死神，她可能也就剩一两天的时间了。一天晚上，已经不早了，斯特罗伊夫来找我，我心里清楚他是要告诉我她的死讯。他已经完全垮了，往日滔滔不绝的饶舌终于消失得无影无踪，一句话也不说，疲惫地一屁股坐到了沙发上。我觉得也找不出什么安慰的话来，于是我让他安静地倒在沙发上。如果我这时找本书去看，我怕他误会我没心没肺，所以我坐在窗子前，点着了烟斗，直到他想开口说话。

“你对我真的很好，”他终于开腔了，“大家对我都很好。”

“别瞎说了。”我有点尴尬地说道。

“在医院里，他们告诉我可以在那儿等，还给了我把椅子，我就坐在病房门外，当她已经失去意识的时候，他们说我可以进去了。她的嘴和下巴都被草酸烧坏了。看到她可爱的皮肤上疤痕累累真是件可怕的事情。她死得很安详，所以直到护士告诉我，我才知道她已经死了。”

他实在是太累，连哭泣的力气都没有了。他四肢无力地仰面躺着，好像所有的力量都从他的躯体中抽干了，一会儿工夫就沉沉地睡着了，这还是他一周以来第一次自然的睡眠。造化有时残酷，有时又怜悯。我给他盖上被子，关了灯。清晨，当我醒来的时候，他仍然在睡着。他一夜都没翻身，金边眼镜还架在他的鼻梁上。





第三十七章


布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫的死因为情况特殊，需要办理所有烦人的手续，但最后我们还是得到允许把她埋葬了。就迪尔柯和我两个人护送灵柩运往墓地。我们去的时候就是平常走路的速度，可回来的路上，马儿一路小跑，因为车夫不断抽打着两匹马，让我心中涌起了莫名的恐怖感，似乎车上的人要抖动肩膀把死人摆脱掉一样。时不时地我能看到我们前面摇摇晃晃的柩车，我们的车夫吆喝着他的一对马儿，免得我们落后太远。我自己也暗自思忖，想把这件事从我的脑海中赶出去。我对这件跟我实际上关系不大的悲剧开始感到厌烦了。我假装跟自己说，我要没话找话是为了分散斯特罗伊夫的注意力，实际上谈点别的话题也是为了让自己能松口气。

“你没想过你最好能离开一段时间吗？”我说，“你现在在巴黎也没有什么可牵挂的了。”

他没作声，但我继续无情地追问下去。

“你对眼前的日子有什么计划吗？”

“没有。”

“你一定得理清头绪振作起来。为什么不到意大利去重新开始画画呢？”

他又一次没有作答，但是我们马车的车夫出来救了我的驾。他让马儿步伐放慢了一会儿，斜过身子开始说话。我听不清他在说什么，于是我把头伸出了车窗外。车夫想知道我们在哪儿落脚，我告诉他等我一分钟。

“你最好来跟我一起吃午饭吧，”我对迪尔柯说，“我告诉他在皮卡尔广场把我们放下吧。”

“我还是不去了，我想回我的画室。”

我犹豫了片刻。

“你想让我陪你一起去吗？”我随后问道。

“不用，我更想一个人回去。”

“那好吧。”

我给车夫指示了要走的方向，在再次的沉寂中，马车拉着我们继续走着。迪尔柯在那个悲惨的上午，也就是他们把布兰奇送进医院的那天之后，再也没回过他的画室。我很高兴他没让我陪着他，在他家门口我和他分了手，我如释重负地走开了。在巴黎的街道上，我又涌起了新的喜悦，用微笑的双眼看着周围来来往往、匆匆而过的人们。天空晴朗，阳光明媚，我觉得自己充溢着生活的欢愉，我无法自禁，就是开心。我把斯特罗伊夫和他的悲伤从脑海中抛到了九霄云外，我要尽情地享受生活。





第三十八章


我有将近一周的时间没有见到斯特罗伊夫了。一天晚上七点刚过，他来找我，约我外出吃饭。他身着重孝，在圆顶礼帽上系着一条宽宽的黑丝带，甚至在手绢上也镶着黑边，他悲哀的打扮暗示着在一场灾难中，他失去了在世界上的所有亲戚，甚至连最远房的表亲也失去了。但是他那丰满、红润、胖嘟嘟的脸颊使得他的孝服穿在身上有点不太协调。想想也真是残忍，天大的不幸已经降临在他的身上，可他看上去还是有点滑稽可笑。

他告诉我他已经决定离开这座城市了，虽说不是去我所建议的意大利，但是他终于决定离开这伤心之地，回到荷兰去。

“我明天就走了。这也许是我们最后一次见面了。”

我说了一句恰当但又略带反驳的话，听后，他惨淡地笑了笑。

“我已经有五年没回过家了。我想我已经把家都忘了，似乎已经远离父辈的祖屋那么久了，一想到要重回故里还有点不好意思。但现在我觉得它是我唯一的避难之所。”

他现在是遍体鳞伤，在他的思想中，渴望回到温柔母亲爱的怀抱。多年来他所忍受的挖苦嘲笑现在似乎已经压垮了他，而布兰奇的背叛又给了他最后致命的一击，一下子击垮了他尚能开心面对冷嘲热讽的心理承受力，对那些嘲笑他的人他再也不能赔着笑脸了。他成了社会的弃儿。他向我讲述在红砖房里度过的孩童时光，讲述他母亲对家庭卫生、整洁有序的执着，她的厨房出奇的干净，厨具锃光瓦亮。每件器具都一向各归其位，每一个角落都一尘不染。洁净，的的确确已经成了她的癖好。我仿佛看见了一位干净利索的小个老太太，脸上红扑扑的像苹果，长年累月，从早到晚地忙活，把屋子收拾得整整齐齐、利利索索。他的父亲是个瘦削的老头，一生的工作和操劳后，双手筋骨毕露，骨节粗大。老人家不爱说话，为人正直。在傍晚，他会大声读报，而此时他的妻子和女儿（现在已经嫁给一艘小渔船的船长了），不愿浪费片刻的时间，正埋头做着针线活儿。这座小城镇多年来一直没有什么改变，远远落在了文明前进步伐的后面，这里的人们年复一年地生活，直到死神的来临，死神就像一位老朋友，带给那些终日辛苦劳作的人们最后的安息。

“我父亲本来希望我像他那样成为一名木匠，我们家有五代了，子承父业，一直都从事着这个行当。也许这才是生活的智慧——沿着父辈的足迹走下去，而不要左顾右盼。但我还是个小男孩的时候，我说要娶住在我们家隔壁的，做马具的手艺人的女儿为妻。她是一个有一双湛蓝眼睛的小姑娘，亚麻色的头发上扎着小辫。她也会把我的屋子收拾得干净利落，井井有条，我也会有一个儿子继承我的买卖。”

斯特罗伊夫轻轻叹了口气，又不作声了。他的思绪也许停留在了刚才他所描述的画面上，他已经放弃的这种安定的生活，此时又让他充满了留恋。

“这世界是艰难和残酷的，我们生在人间，可没人知道我们为什么在这儿。我们死后，同样也没人知道我们到何处去。我们必须谦卑，我们必须看见静处之美，在生活中不要显山露水，以免引起命运的关注；让我们去简单、淳朴的人那里寻求爱情吧，他们的无知比起我们所有知识都宝贵；让我们安安静静，偏安于一隅而知足常乐吧，就像无知的人那样温顺和驯良，那就是生活的智慧。”

在我看来，这番话是他意志消沉的自白，我不同意他这种自暴自弃的看法，但是我没有反驳他，保留我的看法没有说出来。

“究竟是什么原因使你觉得要当一个画家的？”我问道。

他耸了耸肩。

“我碰巧有那么点画画的小才能，我在上学时，因为绘画还拿过一些奖。我可怜的母亲对我的天分感到十分骄傲，她还给我买了一盒水彩颜料作为礼物，把我的速写拿给牧师、医生和法官看。他们把我送到阿姆斯特丹想争取获得奖学金，我还真拿到了。可怜的人呀，她真的特为我自豪，但一想到要和我分离，她的心都快要碎了，可她还是面带笑容，不想在我面前露出伤感。她很开心她的儿子会成为一名艺术家。他们省吃俭用给我提供生活费，当我的第一幅画公开展出的时候，为了亲眼看一下，他们全都来到了阿姆斯特丹，我的父亲、母亲和妹妹都来了。当我母亲看到我的画时，忍不住哭出了声。”说到这里，斯特罗伊夫善良的双眼中也闪耀着泪光，“直到现在，在我们家老屋的每一面墙上，都有一幅我的画作，而且用漂亮的金边镶嵌在画框中。”

他因为幸福的自豪感而脸色通红，我又想起了他那些毫无生气的景物画，画上打扮奇特的农民、柏树和橄榄树诸如此类。在一座农舍的墙上，这些装在耀眼金边框中的画，看上去与周边环境是多么格格不入呀。

“我那位亲爱的母亲，她认为把我培养成了一名艺术家是一件多么了不起的事呀。但是，不管怎么说，也许如果我父亲的愿望能够实现，我现在不过是个诚实木匠的话，说不定对我来说会更好一些。”

“既然你现在知道艺术还能给人们的生活带来什么，你还打算过另外一种生活吗？你会放弃艺术曾带给你的那些快乐吗？”

“艺术是世界上最伟大的东西。”他停顿了一下，然后说道。

他若有所思地看了我一会儿，似乎有些迟疑，但终于开口说：

“你知道我去找过斯特里克兰了吗？”

“你去找过他？”

我很震惊，原以为看一眼斯特里克兰都会让他受不了。斯特罗伊夫淡淡地笑了一下。

“你已经知道我这个人有点没皮没脸。”

“你这话是什么意思？”

他给我讲述了一个奇异的故事。





第三十九章


在我们一起埋葬了可怜的布兰奇后，我和斯特罗伊夫分了手，他怀着沉重的心情走进了自己的房子。有某种东西驱使他走进画室，也许是某种莫名的、自我折磨的愿望，然而他同样害怕能够预见到的痛苦。他拖着沉重的步伐走上楼梯，双脚似乎不愿意往前挪动。在门外，他徘徊了很长时间，想鼓足勇气进去，可感到一阵强烈的恶心袭来，甚至有种冲动，想跑下楼梯追上我，恳求我陪他一起进屋。他还有一种感觉好像有人在画室里，他清楚地记得，上了楼以后，他以前有多次在平台上要停留一两分钟，以平静自己的呼吸，现在想想多么荒谬可笑呀，他因为急不可耐地想见到布兰奇，呼吸反而更加急促了。见到她是一种喜悦，哪怕千百遍也不厌倦，甚至他离开布兰奇才不过一小时，好像他们已经分开有一个月了，一想到要见到她也会激动万分。突然之间，他无法相信她已经死了，也许所发生的事情只是一场梦，一场可怕的噩梦。以前当他转动钥匙，打开房门的时候，他会看见她略微弯着身子，探过桌子，就像夏尔丹的名画《餐前祈祷》[63]中的女人一样姿态优雅。这幅画在他的眼中，一直是那么精美。他急忙从口袋里掏出钥匙，打开房门，走了进去。

公寓看上去仍像有人住着，妻子的整洁利落是让他非常开心的特点之一，他自己生长的环境使得他对于别人的井井有条有着温柔、喜欢的认同之感。当他看到她本能地愿意把每件东西都放在合适的地方，这种天性让他心里感到些许温暖。卧室看上去好像她刚刚离开的样子，几支化妆笔整齐地放在梳妆台上，每把梳子旁边都放着一支。画室里有人已经整理过她度过最后一晚的床，她的睡衣放在一个小盒子里，摆在枕头上面。这一切让人无法相信她再也不会回到这间屋子里来了。

他觉得有点口渴，走进厨房想找点水喝。厨房里也一样的整齐有序，在架子上，放着她和斯特里克兰吵架那天晚上用来盛晚餐的盘子，它们被仔细地洗过。刀叉都放进了抽屉里，吃剩的一块奶酪用器具罩了起来，一个锡铁盒子里放着一块面包。她天天都要去市场，只买些必需品，所以没有隔夜的东西剩下。斯特罗伊夫从进行调查的警察那儿得知，那天晚饭后不久，斯特里克兰就从房子里出来了。而布兰奇还能像往常一样刷洗东西，让他感到有点不寒而栗。她做事有条不紊，显然她的自杀也经过深思熟虑。她的自控能力让人觉得可怕。一阵突如其来的撕心裂肺的痛笼罩了他全身，他的膝盖一软，几乎要摔倒了。他走回卧室，一头栽倒在床上。他哭喊着，叫着她的名字：

“布兰奇，布兰奇。”

想到她所遭的罪，让斯特罗伊夫肝肠寸断，无法忍受。他的眼前突然出现了幻景——她正站在厨房里——厨房比橱柜也大不了多少——正在清洗盘子和杯子，擦拭刀叉和汤勺，把刀具在刀板上快速地蹭了两下，使刀更快更亮。然后把它们各就各位，把水槽也拾掇利索，洗碗布挂起来晾干——洗碗布还在那儿，一块灰色的、用旧了的布头。最后环顾四周，看看每件东西是否都干净了，都利索了。他仿佛看见她脱下了套袖，解下了围裙——围裙就挂在门后的钉上——然后拿上一瓶草酸，走进了卧室。

痛苦使他从卧室的床上跳起来，来到了画室。房间很暗，因为窗帘已经拉下，把大窗户遮得严严实实。他很快地把窗帘拉了上去，但是当他迅速地看了一眼这个曾带给他无限幸福的地方后，忍不住呜咽出了声。这儿什么都没改变，斯特里克兰对周围的环境一向熟视无睹，他住在别人的画室里也没想到要去改变什么。这间画室经过精心布置，很富有艺术情调。在四面的墙上挂着一些旧织锦，钢琴上罩着一块丝绸，虽然很漂亮，但有些褪色。在房间的一角摆放着米洛的维纳斯女神像[64]，另一边是美第奇的维纳斯雕像[65]。这里摆着一个意大利式的小柜橱，上面是代尔夫特[66]的陶器，那儿又挂着一幅浮雕作品。一个漂亮的金色画框里，镶嵌着委拉斯开兹的《教皇英诺森十世像》复制品，这是斯特罗伊夫在罗马时描摹下来的，放在那儿最有装饰效果的是斯特罗伊夫自己的画作，所有的画都装嵌在富丽堂皇的画框中。斯特罗伊夫一向对自己的品位沾沾自喜，他对这间充满浪漫格调的画室总是欣赏不已—虽然现在看到它，好像心头插了把匕首。没有多寻思自己的状态，他还是把一张路易十五时代的桌子——这是他的宝贝之一——稍微挪了一下位置。突然他发现有一张画布面对着墙，这张画布比他习惯用的画布大得多，他很好奇为什么那儿会有这么一张画布。他走过去，把它翻过来，看看上面画了些什么，这是一张裸体画。他的心开始怦怦跳起来，因为他马上猜到那一定是斯特里克兰的一张画。他愤怒地把它往墙上摔去——他把这幅画留在这儿算什么意思？——但是他的动作使得画掉到了地上，画面向下。不管是谁的画，他不能把它留在尘土中，他又把它捡了起来，这时他的好奇心占了上风，他想还是要心平气和地看看它，所以把它展平放到画架上。随后，他后退了几步，为了可以放松地欣赏一番。

他倒吸了一口凉气，画上一个女人正躺在沙发上，一只胳膊枕在头下，另一只搭在身体上，一条腿弯曲着，另一条腿向前伸展，这个姿势很经典。斯特罗伊夫的头嗡的一下，画上的裸体女人是布兰奇。悲伤、嫉妒和愤怒在他的心头翻滚，他声嘶力竭地大喊了一声，气得说不出话来，攥紧拳头，向看不见的敌人示威似的挥舞着，他扯着嗓子喊叫着，几近疯狂，他无法忍受这奇耻大辱，这也太过分了。他发疯似的四下看看，试图找到某件工具，想把这幅画劈成碎片，不能让它多存在一分钟。但他发现没有现成的工具能实现这个目的，于是他又在绘画工具堆里乱翻一通，可怎么也找不到一件能用的东西，他失去了理智。最后，他终于找到了他想要找的东西—一把大刮刀，他猛地扑向它，发出了一声胜利的呼喊，手里紧紧抓住它，像举着一把短剑冲向了那幅画。

当斯特罗伊夫告诉我这件事时，他变得跟这事正在发生一样的激动，他一把抓起我俩之间桌子上的餐刀，挥舞着，他抬起胳膊要好像要刺过来。然后，放开了手，让餐刀咣当一声掉到地上，他看着我，怯生生地笑了笑，没有继续讲下去。

“快说呀。”我催促道。

“我不知道自己怎么了。我一心想在画上戳个大洞，我已经举起胳膊准备全力一击，可突然我似乎明白了它。”

“明白了什么？”

“这幅画，它是一件艺术品，我不能碰它，我害怕了。”

斯特罗伊夫再次沉默了，他的嘴大张着，眼睛死死地盯着我，又圆又蓝的眼珠都快瞪出来了。

“它是一幅伟大的、绝代的画作，我被一阵后怕所笼罩，刚才我几乎犯下了要命的罪恶，为了看得更清楚我把它挪动了一下，脚踩到了那把大刮刀，我战栗了。”

我真的觉得某种感情控制住了他，我对他也有了一种奇怪的印象。就好像我被突然转移到了另外一个价值观完全不同的世界。我漠然不知所措地站在那儿，就像一个陌生人，在这片土地上，人们对平常熟悉的一切所做出的反应，与他原来所知道的截然不同了。斯特罗伊夫想跟我继续谈论那幅画，但他的语句不再连贯，我不得不去猜测他的意思。斯特里克兰已经挣脱了曾捆绑他的种种束缚，他没有找到，正如俗语所说，他原来的自己，而是一个新生的灵魂，带着不可置疑的力量。不仅仅是他的画的主题，虽然内涵丰富、个性独特，却展现出了大胆的简洁；也不仅仅是他的画风，虽然女人的裸体带有强烈的肉欲，但也蕴藏着某种神奇的东西；更不仅仅是他的画的密度感，你能够感到那肉体上所具有的重量；画上还有一种精神层面的东西，让人不安而又新奇，引导人的想象沿着笃定的途径行进，又把人引进暗淡而空旷的太空，只有永恒的星星在闪亮，在这里，所有的灵魂都是赤裸裸的，人们心怀恐惧地去探险，期冀发现各种新的神秘。

如果说上面的文字我好像在卖弄辞藻，那实在是因为斯特罗伊夫用了这些修辞比喻。（我们难道不知道人们在感情激昂的那一刻，会很自然地用上小说中的文字来表达吗？）斯特罗伊夫正试图表达一种他以前从来不曾了解的感情，不知道怎么用正常的词汇表达出来。他如同神秘主义者正力图描述一种不可言喻的东西。但是，于我而言，我明白了一个事实：人们动不动就谈论美，而对这些谈论美的词句并没有感觉，他们把美这个词用得漫不经心，让美失去了力量。美这个词所代表的本质，被成百上千琐屑的东西所享用，由此被剥夺了原有的尊严。他们把一件衣服、一只狗、一篇布道词都用美来形容，而当他们与真正的美面对面时，也无法认出它来了。他们试图遮蔽自己毫无价值的思想还加以虚假的浮夸，反而使他们的感受力变得迟钝起来，就像江湖骗子，他们伪造一种有时他们能够感受得到的精神力量，他们如此滥用这种力量以至于最终失去了它。但是，斯特罗伊夫，这个冥顽不化、不可征服的傻瓜，对美有一种热爱和理解，它们是诚实和真挚的，就如同他真诚的灵魂。美对他的意义就如上帝对虔诚的信仰者一样，当他看见美时，是充满敬畏的。

“当你看见斯特里克兰时，你跟他说了些什么？”

“我请求他和我一起到荷兰去。”

他的话让我有点目瞪口呆，我只能傻呵呵地看着他。

“我们俩都爱布兰奇，在我母亲的房子里会有他住的一个房间的，我觉得在他的周围如果是些贫穷、淳朴的人，会对他的心灵大有好处的，而且我想他或许会从他们那里学到某些东西，这些东西对他会很有用途。”

“他怎么说？”

“他笑了笑，我想他认为我十分愚蠢，他说他还有别的事情要做，没那么多闲工夫。”

我真希望斯特里克兰能用别的套话来表明他的拒绝。

“他把那张画着布兰奇的画送给了我。”

我很想知道斯特里克兰为什么要这样做，但是我没问出口，有一阵子我俩谁都没说话。

“你的所有东西都打点好了吗？”我最后问道。

“我找了个犹太人，他给我凑了个整数，用一笔钱把东西都买去了。我只带我的画作回家，除了这些画，还有一箱衣服和一些书，我此刻在世界上一无所有了。”

“我很高兴你要回家了。”我说道。

我觉得他是有机会把过去的一切慢慢淡忘的，我希望现在看上去似乎是无法忍受的悲伤，随着时间的流逝会渐渐减轻，人类固有的忘却的能力会帮助他再一次振作起来，挑起生活的重担。他仍然年轻，过上几年，当他回首不堪的往事时，生活中虽然有哀伤，但也有快乐。迟早他会在荷兰再娶一位诚实的姑娘，我敢肯定他会获得幸福的，当我想到在他老死之前，他会画上许许多多蹩脚的画作时，我忍不住微笑了起来。

第二天，我把他送走，斯特罗伊夫回荷兰了。





第四十章


接下来的一个月，各种事情把我的时间都占满了，我也看不见任何一个和这件令人悲伤的事件有关系的人了，我的脑海里不再想着这个事件。但是有一天，当我正走在路上，低头专注地寻思某件事时，我跟斯特里克兰竟然打了个照面。看到他的面孔，使我回忆起了所有我希望忘记的可怕的事情，因此内心突然涌起了一阵厌恶。但假装看不见，又未免有点孩子气，所以我朝他点了点头，快步继续走我的路。然而，没过一会儿，我觉得有只手落在了我的肩膀上。

“你真的是行色匆匆呀。”他热忱地说道。

这是他典型的为人处世的方式，别人越不想搭理他，他越对人家客气友好。从我对他打招呼的冷漠态度，他清楚地知道我实在不愿意理他。

“我是很忙。”我简短地回答道。

“我和你一路走吧。”他说。

“为什么？”我问道。

“因为有你作陪我高兴呀。”

我没有回答，他一声不吭地走在我旁边，我们就这样一直走着，大约走了四分之一英里的路，我开始感到有点滑稽可笑了。最后我们路过一家文具店，我突然想起来也许我该买些纸了，这也正好是摆脱他的一个借口。

“我得进去一下，”我说，“再见。”

“我在这儿等你。”

我耸了耸肩，便走进了文具店。我一来想到法国纸不怎么好用，二来我的盘算也落空了，我没必要买一些我用不上的东西徒增负担，我随口询问了几件东西，明知这家店提供不了。然后，不一会儿就走出来，回到了街上。

“你买到你要买的东西了吗？”他问道。

“没有。”

我们继续沉默地走着，随后走到了几条街交叉的地方，我在路口停住了脚步。

“你走哪条路？”我问道。

“你走哪条我就走哪条。”他笑着说。

“我要回家了。”

“我跟你回家，抽上一袋烟。”

“那你总得等人家邀请你呀。”我生硬地顶道。

“要是我知道有被邀请的可能，我会等着的。”

“你看到前面的那堵墙了吗？”我指着前面的墙说道。

“看到了。”

“要是你能看到的话，我想你也应该看出我不想跟你一道了。”

“说实话，我猜到了这一点。”

我忍不住咯咯笑了起来。这是我性格上的一个缺点，我无法让自己讨厌一个让我发笑的人。但马上又收住笑，板起了脸。

“我觉得你这人特别可恶，简直就是最让人憎恶的野兽，倒了八辈子血霉让我碰上了你。你为什么愿意找一个不喜欢你和鄙视你的人做伴呢？”

“我亲爱的伙计，你还真以为我他妈那么在乎你是怎么看我的吗？”

“真是见鬼，”我说道，因为感觉到我的动机站不住脚，我更粗暴了，“我不想认识你。”

“你怕我会把你带坏了吗？”

他的口气让我觉得非常滑稽可笑，我知道他正从侧面看着我，带着一脸讽刺的坏笑。

“我想你手头又紧了吧？”我傲慢地说道。

“我要是还有运气从你这儿借到钱，我他妈的不是个傻瓜吗？”

“如果你不得不让自己奉承人的话，说明你已经落魄到家了。”

他咧开嘴笑了。

“只要我给你机会，时不时地让你得到好东西，你就不会不喜欢我的。”

我不得不咬紧嘴唇，才让自己没笑出声来。他说的话虽然可恨，但也有一定道理。我性格中另一个缺点，就是我喜欢跟棋逢对手的人[67]打交道，不管这人道德上多么堕落。我开始觉得我对斯特里克兰的厌恶只能够单靠我这方面的努力才能维持。我意识到自己道德上的弱点了，但是也看出我对他的非难有些故作姿态，而且我还知道，如果我自己都感觉到了这一点，斯特里克兰敏锐的天性同样也会发现它的，他肯定正在偷偷地笑我呢。我没有接他的话，耸了耸肩，没有再说什么，让他在这场斗嘴中占了上风。





第四十一章


我们到了我住的房子，我不想让他跟我一起进来，但在上楼梯时没吱声。他跟着我，紧跟着我的脚步进了房间。他以前没有来过，可他对我煞费苦心布置算得上赏心悦目的房间根本没瞟上一眼。看到桌子上有一个装烟丝的锡铁盒，他掏出烟斗，径自装上了烟丝。他坐在了唯一一把没有扶手的椅子上，身子向后一靠，椅子的前腿跷了起来。

“如果你想让自己待得舒服些，为什么不坐在一把扶手椅上？”我没好气地说道。

“你干吗关心我舒不舒服？”

“我并不关心，”我回敬道，“我只关心我自己的感受，看到一个人坐在一把不舒服的椅子上，我会感到不舒服的。”

他咯咯笑了起来，但没动身子，安静地抽着烟，不再留意我，好像沉浸在了自己的冥想中。我很想知道他为什么来我的公寓。

在作家身上有种让人困惑的东西，作家的本能会使得他对人性中的种种怪癖感兴趣，而且兴趣盎然得道德感都无力抵制住这种专注劲儿，直到长期的习惯形成自然，应该具有的道德判断的敏感性都变得迟钝了。他自己也意识到，在观察思考让他有点吃惊的邪恶时，会有种艺术上的满足感。但是，作家的真诚会使他承认，他对某些行为的批评远不像对它们的好奇和要探究原因的动机来得强烈。创作出一个恶棍，符合逻辑而且全方位的这样一个人物形象，对于作家来说有着吸引力，但对于法律和秩序来说是背道而驰的。我料想莎士比亚精心创作伊阿古[68]时，可能比披着月光带着遐想，想象着苔丝德蒙娜[69]这个人物更加有热情。也许正是在创作这些恶棍时，作家满足了扎根于自己内心的邪恶本能。这种本能在一个文明的世界中，人们在行为举止和风俗习惯上都会迫使它隐藏在潜意识最神秘的角落。作家能使他笔下的人物有血有肉，栩栩如生，就是把自己无法表露出的部分本能融入了人物刻画。作家的心满意足正是来源于这种天性解放的感觉。

作家更关注了解，而不是判断。

在我的内心中，对斯特里克兰有种彻头彻尾、毫不掺假的恐惧，与之如影随形的是对发现他动机的冷冷的好奇。他让我困惑，而且我也急切地想弄明白他自己怎么看待那场他亲手造成的悲剧，而悲剧所涉及的人对他曾那么好。我大胆地使用“手术刀”开始剖析。

“斯特罗伊夫告诉我，你画他妻子的那幅画作是你有史以来所有作品中最好的。”

斯特里克兰把烟斗从嘴里拿了下来，眼睛发光地微笑着。

“我画那幅画就是为了好玩。”

“为什么你把这幅画给了斯特罗伊夫？”

“我画完它，它对我就没有任何意义了。”

“你知道斯特罗伊夫差点儿就毁掉它吗？”

“这画完全不能令人满意。”

他沉默了一小会儿，接着再次把烟斗从嘴里拿出来，咯咯笑了起来。

“你知道那个小个子来找过我吗？”

“他说的那些话就一点没打动你？”

“没有，我觉得都他妈的是些蠢话和婆婆妈妈的话。”

“我猜你已经忘记是你毁掉了他的生活，是吗？”我质问道。

他若有所思地搓了搓满是胡须的下巴。

“他是个蹩脚的画家。”

“但他是个好人。”

“也是一个优秀的厨子。”斯特里克兰不无嘲弄地补充道。

他的冷酷无情到了没人性的地步，在愤怒之下，我不打算委婉地说出我的话了。

“仅仅是好奇，我希望你能告诉我，你对布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫的死真的没有感到过丝毫的内疚吗？”

我观察他的脸，想找出神情改变的迹象，但发现他的脸色根本没有变化。

“我干吗要内疚？”他问道。

“让我给你摆摆事实，当你奄奄一息的时候，是迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫把你带到自己的家里，他像母亲般地照料你，为你牺牲了自己的时间、舒适和钱财，把你从死神手里硬生生地拽了回来。”

斯特里克兰耸了耸肩。

“这个荒唐的小个子喜欢为别人做这样一些事，那是他的生活方式。”

“就算你不用对他千恩万谢，难道你就可以从他身边抢走他的老婆吗？在你出现以前，他们生活幸福，为什么你不能让人家好好过自己的日子？”

“你凭什么认为他们生活幸福？”

“那是显而易见的。”

“你倒是个目光敏锐的家伙，你认为在他为她做了那件事后，她还能原谅他吗？”

“你这话什么意思？”

“你真的不知道他为什么娶了她吗？”

我摇了摇头。

“她曾是某个罗马小王子的家庭教师，这家人的儿子诱奸了她。她原以为他会娶她，可他们把她赶出了家门，干脆不闻不问了。当时她快要临产了，走投无路下她企图自杀，斯特罗伊夫发现了她，并娶了她。”

“这倒是真像他，我不知道有谁比他更富有同情心的了。”

我过去常常纳闷，这么不般配的一对怎么成了一家子，但这个原因是我做梦也没想到的。也许这正是迪尔柯对他妻子的爱如此特殊的缘故吧，我已经注意到了在迪尔柯的这份感情中，有某种远远超越激情的东西。我也还记得我过去总是想象，在她的内向中掩盖着我所不了解的事情。但是现在我恍然大悟，她希望隐藏的不仅仅是一个羞耻的秘密。她的安静就像孕育在某个岛上空阴沉的乌云，这种安静很快就会被横扫一切的飓风所打破。她的欢快是一种绝望中的欢快。斯特里克兰打断了我的沉思，他说了一句玩世不恭，但很深刻，显然从观察中得来的话，让我吃了一惊。

“一个女人能够原谅男人给她造成的伤害，”他说，“但她一定不会原谅男人因为她的缘故而做出的牺牲。”

“你当然不会冒让跟你有关系的女人怨恨的风险的，这点上你倒是可以很踏实放心。”我回敬道。

他的嘴角露出一丝微笑。

“为了一个机智的反驳，你总是准备牺牲你的原则。”他也反击道。

“那个孩子后来怎么样了？”

“哦，在他们结婚三四个月后出生了，是个死胎。”

接下来，我问了似乎最困扰我的那个问题。

“你能告诉我，为什么你竟然会去招惹布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫吗？”

他很长时间没有吭声，我差点又重复一遍我的问题。

“我怎么知道？”他最后终于开口了，“她不能忍受看我一眼，这让我觉得有趣。”

“我明白了。”

他突然大为光火。

“他妈的，我就是想要她。”

但是，很快他又平静下来，看着我笑了笑。

“起初，她简直吓坏了。”

“你告诉她你想要她了？”

“根本不需要，她知道。我没告诉她一个字，她怕得要死，但最后我得到了她。”

我不知道在他跟我讲述的方式中有什么东西让我奇怪，但这种东西与众不同地暗示着他欲望的强烈。这种东西令人不安，相当可怕。他的生活不一般，好像与物质的东西相隔离，但是又似乎他的身体时不时地要向精神实施报复，他身体中的森林之神会突然占了上风，他在本能的魔爪中变得毫无抵抗之力，任由本性中原始的力量攻城略地，他的灵魂中没有给谨慎或者感恩留有一席之地。

“但是你为什么要把她拐走呢？”我追问道。

“我没有，”他皱着眉头说，“当她说要跟我走时，我几乎和斯特罗伊夫一样吃惊。我告诉过她，当我对她不再需要以后，她就必须得走开。她说愿意冒这个险。”他又停顿了一下，“她有一个完美的身体，我想给她画一张裸体画，当我画完这幅画以后，我就对她失去了兴趣。”

“而她却是全心全意地爱着你呀。”

他一下跳了起来，在我的小房间里走来走去。

“我不想要爱情，我没时间谈情说爱。这是人性的弱点。我是个男人，有时我想要一个女人。当我满足了我的激情后，就准备做其他的事情了。我无法克服欲望，但是我憎恨它。欲望禁锢了我的精神，我期待有朝一日能从全部欲望中挣脱出来，让我没有阻碍地去工作。因为女人除了爱什么都不会干，所以她们会把爱情放到一个可笑的重要地位上，她们还想说服我们相信爱情是生命的全部。而实际上爱情是生活中无足轻重的一部分。我懂得情欲，那是正常和健康的。而爱情则是一种疾病。女人是我享乐的工具，我才没有耐心成为她们所要求的帮手、伴侣、陪同呢。”

我以前从没听到斯特里克兰一口气说这么多话，他说得还义正词严。但是，不管是在这里，还是在别的地方，我都不能假装这是他一点不差的原话；他的词汇量不大，也没有天赋去架构句子，所以我不得不连猜带蒙，利用他说出的感叹词、他脸上的表情、手势和陈词滥调把他的意思拼凑起来。

“你应该生活在一个女人们都是奴隶，而男人们都是奴隶主的时代。”我说道。

“我恰恰就是一个完全正常的男人。”

听他一本正经地说完这句话，我忍不住笑出了声。但是他接着说下去，边说边在房间里来回走动，就像笼中的野兽，一心想把他的感受表达出来，可是发现很难让所说的连贯起来。

“当一个女人爱你的时候，直到她占有了你的灵魂才能心满意足。因为她是弱者，所以具有强烈的统治欲，不把你完全占有和统治，她就不会甘心。她的思想狭隘，所以对不能掌握的抽象之物就深恶痛绝，满脑子都是物质的东西，对男人的理想充满妒忌。而男人的灵魂在宇宙的最高处徜徉，她却寻求用收支账本把他囚禁在日常生活的圈子中，你还记得我妻子吗？我看出布兰奇一点一点地施展出她所有的伎俩，带着无限的耐心，她准备诱捕我，囚禁我。她想把我拉下来直至和她一样的水平，她对我什么也不关心，只想让我成为她的猎物。她愿意为我做世界上所有的事情，除了一个我真正想要的事情：那就是让我一个人待着。”

我沉默了一会儿。

“当你离开她的时候，你指望她会做什么？”

“她可以回到斯特罗伊夫身边去呀，”他没好气地说，“他也时刻准备接纳她呢。”

“你真没人性，”我回答道，“跟你再提这些事也没用，就像跟与生俱来就眼瞎的人描述各种颜色一样。”

他在我的椅子边停住脚步，站在我面前俯视我，带着一副轻蔑而又惊诧的神情，我看出了他神情后面的心思。

“你真的他妈的那么关心布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫的死活吗？”

我对他的问题认真地考虑了一下，因为我想真实地回答它，无论如何是发自我灵魂的真实想法。

“如果我说她死了对我没有造成什么影响的话，那只能说明我自己没有什么同情心。生活原本给了她那么多东西，我认为她的生命最后以那么残忍的方式被夺走，是一件可怕的事情。说来也惭愧，因为我确实不是太关心。”

“你没有勇气把你真正想说的说出来。生命是没有价值的，布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫不是因为我离开她而自杀，而是因为她是一个愚蠢的、无法求得平衡的女人。但是我们谈论她已经够多的了，她完全是个微不足道的女人，来吧，我给你看看我的画。”

他说话的口吻，好像我是个需要分散一下注意力的孩子。我很恼火，与其说是跟他生气，还不如说是跟自己较劲。我又想到了斯特罗伊夫夫妇。他们本来在蒙特马特尔那间温馨的画室里过着幸福的生活，这一对夫妇是那么单纯、善良和好客，然而这种幸福却被无情的命运打击得支离破碎，我认为这是件残酷的事情。而最为残酷的是，这场悲剧实际上没有对人们的生活产生多大的影响，日出日落，生活照旧，没有人因为这件悲惨的事生活得更糟糕。我还想过，就连迪尔柯，这个感情波动很大，而情感深度不够的男人，也会很快把事情淡忘。然而布兰奇的生命，当初怀着光明的希望和美妙的梦想走进生活，可如今好像她从未存在过一样，一切看上去都是那么虚无和愚蠢。

斯特里克兰已经拿起帽子，站在那儿看着我说：

“你来吗？”

“你干吗要跟我套近乎？”我问他，“你明知道我憎恶和鄙视你。”

他开心地呵呵笑了起来。

“你是唯一跟我吵架，而我又他妈的一点儿也不在乎你是怎么看我的人。”

因为突然的愤怒，我觉得我的双颊都红了。但没法让他明白，由于他冷酷无情的自私，可以让别人怒火中烧。我恨不得一下子刺穿他那副冷漠的甲胄，但是我也知道，归根结底，他的话不无道理。也许，我们没有意识到，实际上我们很重视自己对别人的影响，通过评估他们会怎样看待我们对他们的意见，来判断自己的影响力。同理，会憎恶那些我们对他们无法产生影响的人，我想这是人类自尊上最疼痛的伤口，但是，我不会让他看出来，因为他的言行，我火冒三丈了。

“一个人可能对别人完全无视吗？”我说，与其说是讲给他听，不如说是讲给自己听的，“你要存在，就得依靠别人。想只为自己，只依靠自己活着的企图是荒谬的。早晚有一天，你会生病、疲惫和老去，随后，你会爬着回到人群当中。你在内心渴望别人的抚慰和同情时，你不感到羞愧吗？你正在尝试一种不可能的事情，你身上的人性迟早会向往人类共同的纽带的。”

“跟我来，去看看我的画吧。”

“你想到过死亡吗？”

“我干吗要想？死不死无所谓。”

我凝视着他。他站在我的面前，一动不动，眼睛里带着一丝嘲笑。但是除了这些，一时之间我好像看出了端倪，一个炙热的、饱受折磨的灵魂，目标是更为伟大的东西，它超越了与肉体捆绑在一起的，能够被领略的任何东西。我瞥见的是对某种无法描述的事物的热烈追求。我看着眼前这个衣衫褴褛的人，他的大鼻子和闪亮的眼睛，他的红胡须和乱蓬蓬的头发。我猛然有了一个奇想，外表只是一个躯壳，在我面前呈现的是一个脱离了肉体的灵魂。

“我们走吧，去看看你的画作。”我说道。





第四十二章


我不知道为什么斯特里克兰会突然提出要让我看看他的画作，但我对有这样的机会还是欢迎的，从一个人的作品中可以洞察这个人本身。在社会交往中，他留给你的印象是他希望世人可以接受的表象，你要真正了解他，只能通过他的一举一动来推断，只能通过他无意识的表现，和他脸上露出的，连自己都没察觉到稍纵即逝的表情来判断。有时人们把一副假面具戴得炉火纯青，时间一久，连他们也觉得自己成了所扮演的人。但是，在他的书里或画里，一个真实的人会毫无防范地交出自己的全部，他的矫饰只会暴露他的空虚。上了漆的木板条看上去像铁条，但终归是木板条。矫饰出来的个性无法掩盖思想的平庸。对于敏锐的观察者而言，一个人创作出的，哪怕是最漫不经心的作品，也会泄露他灵魂最深处的秘密。

当我沿着斯特里克兰住的房子那似乎没有尽头的楼梯向上爬的时候，我得承认我的心情还是有些激动的。我好像正踏在通往令人吃惊的冒险之旅的门槛上，我好奇地四下打量着这个房间，它比我记忆中的还要狭小窘迫，可以说是家徒四壁。真不知道我那些号称需要宽敞工作室的朋友们会怎么想，他们发誓说，除非满足他们喜欢的所有条件，否则无法进行创作。

“你最好站在那儿。”他说，并指向一个地点，也许他认为在那儿，我能有一个最佳的视角，更好地欣赏他给我展示的画作。

“我猜，你不想让我开口吧。”我说道。

“不想，你真该死，我想让你管住自己的舌头。”

他把一幅画放在画架上，让我看上一两分钟，然后把它拿下来，换上另外一幅画。我觉得他大约让我看了三十幅画作，这些画作是他在六年间一直创作的成果。他没有卖掉一幅画，这些画的尺寸大小不一，最小的是些静物画，最大是些风景画，还有六七张肖像画。

“就是这些了。”他最后说道。

我希望能够说，我立刻就认识到了这些画的美妙和非凡的原创性。如今我又再次看过其中很多画作，其余的通过仿制品我也不陌生了，可让我吃惊的是，当我第一眼看到它们的时候，居然感到十分失望。我当时根本没有感受到真正的艺术品会带给人的特殊的激动，斯特里克兰的画作带给我的印象就是让我困惑不安。而实际上，我当时根本没想到要买上几幅，这是至今都让我自责的事，我错过了千载难逢的机会。这些画的大部分现在都已经经过各种途径进入博物馆了，剩下的画被一些富有的业余收藏者如获至宝地收藏。我试图为自己开脱，我认为自己的品位还是不错的，但是也意识到了缺乏创新性。我对绘画知之甚少，我只是沿着别人已开拓出的道路信步走下去。在当时，我对印象派大师的作品佩服得五体投地，期盼能拥有一幅西斯莱[70]和德加[71]的作品，我对马奈也崇拜有加，他的《奥林匹亚》在我看来似乎是现代最伟大的画作了，而《草地上的早餐》也深深地打动了我，这些作品在我眼中似乎是空前绝后了。

我不想描述那些斯特里克兰给我展示的画了，因为对画的描述总是很乏味，更何况，这些画现在对于所有喜欢艺术的人来说，都已经不再陌生了。如今他的影响如此巨大，已经对现代绘画艺术产生了不可忽视的作用，他属于第一批探索那种画风的一代巨匠，现在很多人对这种画风已经做了分析，所以大家都熟悉了。斯特里克兰的画，如果是第一次见着，确实要做好心理准备。大家别忘了，我以前从没见过这种画风。首先，我似乎对他技巧的笨拙吃惊不小，习惯了老一辈大师的画风，坚信安格尔[72]才是近代最伟大的画家，我那时认为斯特里克兰画得太差了，我对他所崇尚的简洁一无所知。我还记得他画了一个静物画，在盘子上的几个橘子，我看到时很错愕，因为盘子画得不圆，橘子也不对称。他的肖像画也比真人的尺寸稍大，这种技巧让人觉得肖像看上去很别扭。在我的眼中，这些肖像的面孔就像是卡通人物的脸，这种画风对我来说是全新的。风景画就更让我觉得困惑不解了，有两三幅画画的是枫丹白露的树林和巴黎的几条街道，我的第一感觉就是这些画可能是一位喝醉了的马车夫画的。我彻底被搞糊涂了，在我看来，画的色彩也格外的粗糙。我头脑中的想法是，整幅画就是一出惊人的、莫名其妙的闹剧。现在回想起来，我对斯特里克兰的敏锐印象更为深刻了，他从一开始就看出了在艺术上会有一场革命，他在一开始就认识到的天才般的绘画技法，现在已得到全世界的公认。

然而，虽说我感到困惑和不安，但我不能不说，对他的画我还是印象深刻的。即使我对这种画风懵懂无知，但也强烈感觉到，这些画在努力表达自己，真的很有力量。我很激动，也很有兴致。我觉得这些画好像在向我倾诉什么东西，某种很重要的东西，我需要知道，但是我又说不出它是什么。在我看来，它们好像很丑，却又暗示着一个重大的秘密，而不是直接明示。它们很奇怪地撩拨人的心弦，给了我一种我分析不出来的感情；它们所表达的东西是任何言辞也无力说出口的。我想象斯特里克兰一定是在物质层面的东西里，隐隐约约看到了某种精神的含义，这种精神上的含义如此奇异，以至于他只能用晦涩的象征来暗示和表达，好像他在宇宙的混沌中发现了一种新的图案，在笨拙地试图描绘出来，因为力不从心，心灵上充满了痛苦，我看见一个饱受折磨的精神正奋力寻求表达上的释放。我转向他说道：

“我不知道你的媒介手段是否搞错了？”我说道。

“你到底什么意思？”

“我认为你正在试图表达什么，我不是很清楚那是什么，但是我怀疑，用绘画的方式来表达，是不是最佳的方法。”

我原以为当我看到他的画，会找到线索去理解他怪异的性格，结果我想错了。这些画只增加了原来就填满我心中的震惊，我比以前更加困惑了。只有一件事似乎我搞清楚了——也许这甚至也是想象——那就是他正激情满满地坚持获得自由，从束缚他的力量中挣脱出来。但是这种力量是什么，自由的底线又在哪里，依然模糊不清。我们生活在世界上，每个人都是单枪匹马地战斗。他被囚禁在一个铜塔里，只能通过一些符号和他的同胞交流，这些符号没有共同的价值，所以它们的意义是模糊不定的。我们可怜巴巴地想把自己心中的财富传达给别人，但是别人没有力量来接收它们，所以我们只能孤独地前行。虽然并着肩，但心却没有在一起，无法了解我们的同胞，也不能被我们的同胞所了解。我们就像生活在某个国家的人，但是对该国的语言不太会说，尽管有美丽景色和深刻思想要交流，可只能按照会话手册上的句型只言片语地交流，造成交流的平常乏味。他们脑子里充满着各种想法，可只能告诉你“园丁的姑姑有把雨伞在屋子里”[73]一类的话。

我对这些画的最后的印象是，为了表达心里的某种状态，画家付出了巨大的努力，我觉得要想寻得解释，就必须在那些最为困惑我的东西上下功夫。显然易见，色彩和形式对于斯特里克兰来说有一种意义，而且对他自身来说是非同寻常的，他处于无法忍受的状态下，一定要把他感受到了的东西传达出去。他只带着这种目的去创作。如果能够更接近他所寻求的、未知的那种东西，他会毫不犹豫地简化和扭曲色彩与线条。事实对他来说毫无意义，因为在大量不相关事件的表象下，他要寻找某种对他来说更加有意义的东西。好像他已经明晰了宇宙的灵魂，受到驱使要表达出来。虽然这些画让我困惑和感到混乱，但我不能不被画中显然流露出来的感情所感动。而且，不知道为什么，我觉得自己的感情也发生了变化，对斯特里克兰的感情产生了我从未料到会经历的情况——对他充满了怜惜与同情。

“我认为我现在知道了，对于布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫，你为什么会屈从你的感情了。”我对他说道。

“为什么？”

“我认为你的勇气丧失了，你身体的软弱和你的灵魂进行了交流。我不知道什么样的无限渴求控制了你，使得你被迫走上危险而孤独的求索之路，你指望的目的是能够最终从折磨你的精神中得到解脱。我看见你好像是永恒的朝圣者，走向某个也许根本不存在的圣地。我不知道你的目的地是怎样神秘莫测的极乐世界，你自己知道吗？也许它就是你寻找的真理和自由，一瞬间，你觉得你能够在爱情中找到解脱。我认为你疲惫的灵魂寻求在一个女人的怀抱中得到安息，而当你发现根本得不到安息时，你就开始恨她，你对她没有怜悯之情，因为你对自己都没有怜悯之心。你把她杀死只是出于恐惧，因为你还在为你刚刚死里逃生的危险而颤抖呢。”

他干笑了一下，又用手捋了捋胡须。

“你真是一个可怕的感伤主义者，我可怜的朋友。”

一个星期以后，我偶然听说，斯特里克兰已经去了马赛。以后我再也没见到他。





第四十三章


回过头看，我认识到我写下的有关查尔斯·斯特里克兰的所有文字，看上去一定不会令人十分满意。我已经把自己知道的一些事件记录了下来，但是它们还是模糊不清的，因为我不知道导致这些事件的原因。其中最不可思议的就是斯特里克兰决心要成为一名画家，似乎很随意，虽然在他的生活环境和成长历程中一定会有原因的，但我却一无所知。从他的谈话中，我又没能收集到任何信息。如果我正在写一本长篇小说，与其去记叙我所知道的关于这人令人好奇的个性，还不如去虚构一些描述他心灵变化的材料，我认为可以描写他在很小的时候，就对这行有着强烈兴趣，但是被他父亲的愿望所扼杀，或者因为要养家糊口而牺牲；我应该描写他对生活中的种种约束不耐烦，在他对艺术的激情和他身份地位所要肩负起的责任之间冲突不断，这样还能唤起读者对他的同情。这样我就能把他塑造成一个个性更加鲜明的人物。兴许读者有可能在他身上看到一个新的普罗米修斯[74]的影子，这样可能就会有机会创作出这个英雄的现代版，为了给人类谋幸福而甘愿承受各种天谴的痛苦，这一直是能打动人心的主题。

在另一方面，我也可以从婚姻关系的影响中找到他绘画的动机，可能有多种方式来处理这个故事。由于他的妻子爱结交一些作家、画家，与这些艺术家熟络起来以后，使得他潜在的绘画天分能够得以展示，或者可能是家庭不和谐，使得他把精力转移到自己身上。还有就是因为爱上了另外一个女人，激情把闷烧在心底的暗火扇成了明亮的火焰。而且，我认为也可以把斯特里克兰太太刻画成完全不同的模样，我可以罔顾事实把她描写成一个唠唠叨叨、乏味的女人，或者把她塑造成个性偏执，对精神生活毫无追求的女人。我甚至可以把斯特里克兰的婚姻写成是一种长期的折磨，只有逃离才是唯一可能的解决办法。我想可以强调斯特里克兰对他那不般配的妻子的耐心和同情，使得他不愿意摆脱身上的枷锁。我当然还可以根本不提那两个孩子的事。

如果想把故事写得引人入胜，我也可能会写到某种机缘下，他结识了一个老画家，此人在年轻时，或由于家境贫困，或由于渴望商业上的成功，而错误地虚掷了才华，而他看到斯特里克兰身上具有的他年轻时浪费的潜力和可能性，于是影响斯特里克兰放弃一切，追随艺术这个神圣的君主。我会浓笔重墨地描写这位成功的老画家。他富有而受人尊敬，然而他知道，如果他能过上另一种生活，可能会更好，但他已经没有力量去追求了。如果这样一种写法，讽刺的意味会更强。

事实却格外枯燥无味，斯特里克兰，一个刚离校门的年轻人，轻松自然地进了一家证券经纪交易所，没感到有何不妥。直到结婚，他都过着像同行们一样的普通生活，在交易所里做上几笔不大不小的交易，对德比赛马和牛津、剑桥两校的划艇比赛也很有兴趣，充其量对比赛结果下上一两镑的赌注。我认为他在业余时间还会去打打拳击，在他家壁炉上放着郎格瑞夫人[75]和玛丽·安德森[76]的照片，有空也翻翻《笨拙》和《体育时代》，去汉普斯特德跳跳舞。

有很长一段时间我没见过他了，不过没什么关系。这些年里，他一直在为熟练掌握一门困难的艺术而苦苦挣扎，日子过得单调乏味，为了挣钱养家，也不断采取一些权宜之计，我不知道能有什么东西好写。记述他，实际上就是记述他看见的，发生在别人身上的事，我不认为这些事对他的性格会有任何影响。如果要写一部以现代巴黎为背景的冒险小说，他倒可能积累了丰富的素材。但是，他还是保留着超然物外的态度，从他的谈话中我们判断，这些年没有发生让他印象特别深刻的事情。也许当他去巴黎时，年纪已经不小了，不会成为花天酒地环境的受害者。看上去似乎奇怪，他留给我的印象是这个人不善实际，有一说一。我猜想他的生活在这段时间很浪漫，但他自己当然看不出来有什么浪漫的。可能为了实现生活中的浪漫，在你身上必须要有像演员那样的东西。而且，要能够跳出自身之外，你必须观察自己的行为，而且要抱着独立和专注的兴趣去观察。但是没人比斯特里克兰更一根筋的了，我不知道谁比他有更强的自我意识。不幸的是，我无法描述他在攀登艺术高峰的途中，如何历经艰难险阻，才成功登顶的。因为如果我能够写出他在失败面前无所畏惧，用不懈的努力和勇气扼住绝望的喉咙，面对自我怀疑——这一艺术家最大的敌人时，能够顽强地坚持不放弃。这样去写，我会激起人们对这样一个缺乏迷人之处的人物的同情，我完全清楚这一点，可我手中没有材料去这样描述，我从没见过斯特里克兰是如何工作的，我知道别的人也没见过。他的斗争与挣扎是他个人的秘密，如果在他的画室里，在孤寂中他曾绝望地和上帝的天使扭打在一起的话，他是不允许别人探测到他的痛苦的。

当我写到他和布兰奇·斯特罗伊夫的关系时，我对一些只能根据事实整理出来的片段感到懊恼。为了让我的故事连贯，我本该描述一下他们悲剧性结合的进程，但是我对他们一起生活的三个月一无所知。毕竟，一天有二十四个小时，感情的高峰只有在稀少的间隔才能达到，而他们怎么度过剩下的时间，我只能靠想象了。当光线尚在室内，只要布兰奇的气力还能挺得住，我想斯特里克兰就会一直画下去；当她看见他全身心都沉浸在工作中，也一定会惹得她生气。那个时候，对他而言，作为情妇，她已不再存在，她只是一个模特。随后，有很长时间他们生活在一起，而没有多少话，这种状况一定吓坏了她。当斯特里克兰暗示，她之所以委身于他是因为她要报复迪尔柯·斯特罗伊夫，想找到一种胜利的感觉，因为他是在她走投无路的情况下向她伸出了援手。他的这种暗示为很多阴暗的揣度打开了大门，我希望这种暗示不是真的，对我来说，它似乎过于可怕。但是谁能测量出人心的微妙呢？那些只希望从人心里寻到高尚的情操和正常感情的人当然是猜不透的。当布兰奇看到，斯特里克兰除了偶尔会迸发出片刻激情，大多数时间对她都是冷淡的，心中一定充满了痛苦。甚至在我提到的激情时刻，她也认识到，对于他来说，她不是个有血有肉的人，而是一个他取乐的工具；他还是一个陌生人，她试图用一切可怜的手段想把他和自己维系在一起，努力用舒适的生活网罗住他，但她殊不知他根本不在乎安逸的生活。她不辞辛苦地给他做他爱吃的东西，却不知道他对食物的好坏根本无所谓。她害怕让他一个人待着，总是无微不至地呵护他。当他的激情休眠的时候，她寻求去激起它，因为那时至少她还产生一种把他控制在手的幻觉。也许她动动脑筋也会想到，她锻造的锁链只会唤起他摧毁束缚的本能，就像厚玻璃窗户会使你的手指头发痒，想找半块砖头把它砸破；但是她的内心缺乏足够的理性，使得她继续一段她明知是致命的旅程。她一定很不幸福，但是爱情的盲目使她相信自己渴望的东西是真实的，她的爱情是那么伟大，对她来说，似乎不可能不会唤醒同样的爱来回报她。

然而，我对斯特里克兰性格的研究，还有一个缺憾，它比对很多事实不了解还要严重得多。因为他和女人们的关系是如此惹人注目和突出，所以我写了很多，而实际上它们只是他生活中并不太重要的部分。而具有讽刺意味的是，它们却悲剧性地影响了其他人的生活。他真实的生活由梦想和巨量艰辛工作组成。

小说的虚构也正是在此处。因为在男人身上，一般说来，爱情只不过是每天各种事务中所发生的一段小插曲而已，小说中却要强调它，把它放在重要位置上，对于实际生活，这是不真实的。男人们几乎都不会把它看作是世界上最重要的事，不过这些男人也不是很有生活情趣的人；甚至于那些把爱情看得很重的女人，对这些男人也看不起。女人们会被男人们奉承，被撩拨得春心萌动，但她们有一种不安的感觉，觉得自己是可怜的人。甚至在恋爱期间短暂的间隔，男人们也会做其他一些能分散他注意力的事情，比如对从事谋生的买卖投入精力，专注于体育活动，对艺术兴趣盎然。在大多数情况下，他们把自己的不同活动分别安排在不同的领域里，他们从事一项活动，就会暂时把另一项活动排除在外。他们有一种能力，在某个时间段，他们会全神贯注地干一件已经占据了身心的工作，如果做一件工作的时间和精力被另一件工作所侵占，他们就会非常恼火。作为情人，男人和女人的区别就是，女人可以全天候地沉湎于爱情，而男人只是有时有晌地顾及一下它。

斯特里克兰的性欲只占他生活中的一小部分，它无关紧要，有时还很烦人，他的灵魂目标在是其他地方。他也有狂野的激情，偶尔欲望也会充满他的身体，迫使他放浪形骸，纵欲狂欢一回。但他憎恨这种本能夺走了他自我控制的能力，我都想到了，他甚至还憎恨在他淫荡时必不可少的伴侣。当他重新控制自己后，看到他刚享用完的女人，会不寒而栗。然后，他的思想会在天堂中安静地飘荡，他对那个女人感到恐怖，也许就像画上的蝴蝶，在花丛上翩翩起舞，可分明感觉到它是一只肮脏的蛹，蝴蝶只是胜利地从它的蛹里飞出。我认为艺术是性本能的表现形式。当在那不勒斯海湾金黄的月光下看到一位可爱的女人，同样的感情会在男人们的心中被激起，还有提香[77]的《墓穴》就是在这种本能的驱动下创作出来的。有可能斯特里克兰憎恨这种性欲的释放，因为这种感觉和他从艺术创作中获得的满足感相比，在他看来似乎是粗野的。因为我描述的这个男人是残忍、自私、野蛮和放荡的，而他同时还是一个伟大的艺术家，对我来说，好像也觉得很不可思议，但事实就是如此。

他生活得很拮据，甚至比一个工匠还穷。他工作得很辛苦，对大多数人追求的雅致和美好的生活一点儿也不放在心上。他对名和利都不在乎。你都无法赞扬他抵制了诱惑，大多数人为了和这个世界妥协，必须接受这些诱惑的支配，而他压根就没有感觉到诱惑，妥协的念头也就绝不可能闪过脑海。他生活在巴黎，却比生活在底比斯沙漠中的隐士还要孤独。他对同伴们一无所求，除了告诉他们让他一个人待着。他一心都扑在他的目标上，为了追求这个目标，他愿意牺牲的不仅仅是他自己——这一点很多人倒是都能做到——而且还有别人。他生活在自己的幻境中。

斯特里克兰是一个令人嫌恶的人，但是我仍然认为他是一个伟大的人。





第四十四章


对画家们的艺术有怎样的评论具有某种重要性，斯特里克兰对于过去伟大的艺术家们有何看法，我应该把自己所知道的都写出来，很自然地放到书中。但是恐怕我不值得把它们记下来，因为斯特里克兰不是一个健谈的人，他没有什么才能把自己的话用能让听众记住的词句突出体现。他并不机智，但幽默中充满讥讽，如果我能成功地再现他说话方式的话，这些都能看到。他对别人观点的反驳十分粗鲁，有时因为实话实说，惹人发笑，但这也是幽默方式的一种。正是因为斯特里克兰的幽默与众不同而显得更有力量，如果大家都这样说的话，它也就失去了让人觉得好玩的效果了。

我不得不说，斯特里克兰不是一个有大智慧的人，他对绘画艺术的一些看法也不比普通人高明多少。我从没听他评论过一些和他风格类似画家的作品——比如说塞尚[78]，或者凡·高[79]的作品，我甚至非常怀疑他是否看过这些画家的作品。他对印象派画家的作品也兴趣不大，虽然他们的绘画技巧让他印象深刻，但我想象他肯定认为这些人对待艺术创作的态度是平庸的。当斯特里克兰对莫奈的出类拔萃大加评论时，他却说：“我更喜欢温特尔哈尔特[80]的作品。”但是，我敢说他说这话是为了气人，如果真是这样的话，他做到了。

让我感到失望的是，不能记录他在评论老一辈大师们时的放纵言论。他的性格太古怪，如果他对这些人的评论是令人无法容忍的，我觉得倒能使他的形象更完整些。我认为需要把他归类为对前辈们的艺术，爱用一些荒诞理论妄加评论的人，但事实上我的希望幻灭了，我得承认他对他们的看法与一般人没有什么两样。我认为他根本不知道艾尔·格列柯，他对委拉斯开兹青睐有加，尽管怀有某种厌烦不耐的情绪。夏尔丹的作品能使他愉悦，伦勃朗[81]的作品能够让他狂喜。他描述伦勃朗的作品留给他的印象时，话说得非常粗俗，让我不能重复。唯一令他感兴趣的画家是老布鲁盖尔[82]，这完全出乎我的意料。我当时对这位画家了解不多，而斯特里克兰又没有能力把自己的想法解释清楚，我现在还能记得他关于这位画家所说的下面这句话，是因为他说得过于粗俗，词不达意，不能让人满意。

“他还可以，”斯特里克兰说，“我敢打赌他发现了画画如下地狱。”

后来在维也纳，我看到彼得·布鲁盖尔的几幅画作，我想我才理解了为什么这位画家会引起斯特里克兰的关注，因为他也是一个对世界有着自己独特幻象的画家。我在当时记了大量的笔记，打算写一些关于他的文字，但是后来我的笔记遗失了，现在留下的只是一种感情的回忆了。彼得·布鲁盖尔似乎把他的同类看成是怪诞的，他对他们奇形怪状的样子很生气，生活是一种混沌，充满了滑稽可笑与肮脏卑鄙的事情，只能给人们提供笑料，然而，这种笑也是一种哀伤的笑。布鲁盖尔给我的印象是，他想用一种手段努力表达只适合于另一种方式表达的感情，正是这一点，在模模糊糊的意识里激起了斯特里克兰的同感。也许他们两人正试图用绘画表达思想，而实际上这些思想更适合用文学的方式来表达。

斯特里克兰这个时候一定接近四十七岁了。





第四十五章


我前面已经说过，要不是一次冒险的旅程把我带到了塔希提岛，我毫无疑问绝对不会写这本书的。查尔斯·斯特里克兰走过了很多地方，最后来到了塔希提岛，正是在那里他画了很多画，这些画作牢固地奠定了他后来的声誉。我想没有哪个艺术家能够完全实现他魂牵梦萦的理想，而斯特里克兰不断地受到他纠结于技巧的困扰，在表达用他思想的眼睛所看到的幻景时，也许还不如别的画家。只有在塔希提岛，周边的环境更适合他。他发现在他的周围，足以激发他灵感的事件很多，而且对于他的创作很有效果，他后期的画作至少给出了他苦苦追寻的东西的暗示。这些画作提供了某种新颖而奇异的想象空间，好像在遥远的国度，他的精神脱离了躯壳，游游荡荡寻找着安身之所，最后终于能够用肉身做衣。借用一句老生常谈的话，在这里，他找到了自己。

我来到这个偏远的小岛，应该能够马上唤起我对斯特里克兰的兴趣，这似乎是自然而然的事，但是当时我正在创作的作品占据了我全部精力，我得把所有不相关的事情都抛到脑后。直到来到这儿好几天以后，我才想起这个地方和他有着千丝万缕的联系，毕竟我已经有十五个年头没有见过他，距离他去世也有九年了。然而，我现在都觉得，本来我以为到了塔希提岛，我会把对我来说一些紧迫和重要的事情都从头脑中赶出去，可甚至都过了一周，我发现让自己冷静清醒、有条不紊可不是件容易的事。我还记得第一个早晨我醒得很早，当我走到宾馆的露台上时，四周静悄悄的，一个人也没有。我绕着厨房溜达了一圈，厨房锁着门，在门外的一条长凳上，一个当地的侍者正在睡觉，看来一时半会儿我还吃不上早餐，所以我漫步到了海滨的道路上。中国人已经在店铺里忙碌起来了。天空中还泛着黎明前的鱼肚白，环礁湖上笼罩着死一般的沉寂。十英里之外是莫里阿岛，像座圣杯形状的巍峨要塞，护卫着自己的秘密。

我完全不能相信自己的眼睛。自从我离开威灵顿后，日子过得似乎与众不同和非同一般。威灵顿是一座整洁的英格兰小城，位于南部海岸，属于海港城镇，我在海上航行了三天后，开始下起了暴风雨，乌云在空中翻滚，相互追逐。后来，大风减弱了，大海变得安静、湛蓝。太平洋比别的海洋更加荒凉寂寥，海面看上去更加宽阔，即使最普通的航行也会有种冒险的感觉，你呼吸的空气中好像有灵丹妙药，让你精神气爽地准备面对突发事件。它不会赐予凡夫俗子了解任何事物的能力，当你隐约感到进入了一个金色的想象中的国度时，船已经接近了塔希提岛。莫里阿岛是塔希提岛的姊妹岛，当这个小岛进入视线时，会看到它危崖耸立，气势宏伟，突然从荒无人烟的海面上神秘地突兀而起，好像神奇的魔杖唤出的虚无缥缈的织锦。小岛巉岩嶙峋，有如蒙特塞拉特山[83]被移到太平洋中，你可能会想象波利尼西亚的骑士们正在守卫着它，同时还在举行神秘的异教仪式，但不会让一般人知道。随着距离的接近，这座岛正在揭开面纱，露出它的美丽，你可以看见它可爱顶峰的更加清晰的轮廓，但当你航行路过它时，它还要保守秘密。于是，你看到，它黑黢黢地不可冒犯，似乎用一种多石的、不可接近的冷峻把自己拢在一起。船只驶到近处，如果你想在珊瑚礁寻觅一个入口，它就会突然从人们的视线里消失，这一点儿也不奇怪。映入你眼帘的仍是太平洋的一片茫茫碧波，寂寥无垠。

塔希提岛是一座高耸出海面的岛屿，岛上树木郁郁葱葱，暗绿色的深褶使你猜到那是一条条寂静的峡谷，在阴暗峡谷的深处神秘莫测，沿着峡谷流淌着冰冷的潺潺溪水。你会觉得在这个树木遮天蔽日的地方，远古时代以来，生活就按照古老的方式一直延续至今而未改变。甚至在这里，你能感到某种东西是悲伤和可怕的，但这种印象很快就会烟消云散，反而使你更加敏锐地感到要及时行乐。就好像快乐的一群人对于小丑的插科打诨哈哈大笑时，在小丑的眼中你会发现悲伤的神色。他的嘴角在微笑，他的笑话更可笑，因为他在和大笑的人互动交流时，发现自己内心无法忍受的孤独越发强烈。塔希提岛在微笑，亲切而友好，就像一个可爱的女人优雅地彰显她的迷人与美丽。当船进到位于帕皮提的港口时，那种身心得以抚慰的感觉简直无与伦比，美妙极了。停泊在码头的双桅纵帆船整齐、干净，海湾环抱的小镇洁白、文雅，而凤凰木在蔚蓝的天空下却红得刺目，像激情的呼喊一般，极力炫示自己鲜艳的色彩。它们有着放浪形骸的肉欲，让你喘不上气来。当船靠近码头的时候，穿过码头蜂拥到岸边的人们兴高采烈而又彬彬有礼，他们大声喊叫，开心地挥舞着手臂。这是一片褐色面孔的海洋，你会有这样一种印象：在炎炎碧空下，色彩在移动。每件事都是在奔忙中完成的，无论是从船上卸行李，还是海关的通关，似乎每个人都在冲你微笑。天气很热，光线照得人睁不开眼，而各种色彩又让人头晕目眩。





第四十六章


我到塔希提岛不久，就遇见了尼科尔斯船长。有一天上午，我正在宾馆的露台上吃早餐，他走过来并做了自我介绍。他早就听人说过我对查尔斯·斯特里克兰感兴趣，打过招呼后，就跟我说他来是为了谈谈斯特里克兰的事。就像在英格兰的乡下一样，塔希提岛的人喜欢张家长李家短地聊闲天，有那么一两次我打听过斯特里克兰的画，这消息很快就传开了。我问初次见面的船长是否吃过了早餐。

“是的，我早就喝了咖啡，”他回答道，“不过我倒是不介意喝上点威士忌。”

我招呼一个中国侍者过来。

“你是不是认为现在喝酒太早了点？”船长说道。

“你和你的肝好好商量一下，然后再决定吧。”我回答说。

“我其实平时滴酒不沾。”他一边给自己斟了大半杯加拿大克拉伯牌威士忌，一边说道。

当他笑的时候，露出的牙齿有的豁着，有的发黄了。他是一个很瘦削的人，个头比中等略低，灰白头发剪得很短，嘴上的灰白胡子短而粗，看得出来，他有好几天没有修边幅了，脸上的皱纹很深，长期暴露在太阳下面，脸被晒成了古铜色。他长着一双蓝色的小眼睛，眼珠令人吃惊的灵活，我的手哪怕稍微一动，它们就能快速地跟着动，看上去让人感觉这人是个老江湖了。但是，在那一刻他倒是全心全意地对我，而且一副哥们义气的模样。他穿着一身破旧的卡其布套装，双手看上去真应该好好洗一洗了。

“我和斯特里克兰很熟，”他一边向后靠在椅子上点亮我递给他的雪茄烟，一边说道，“通过我，他才来到这个岛上。”

“你在哪儿遇见他的？”我问道。

“在马赛。”

“你在马赛做什么？”

他冲我讨好地笑了笑。

“嗯，我想那时我正处于困境。”

从我这位朋友现在的这副模样来看，他的窘况依然没有改善。我准备和他交个朋友，培养一下感情，和这些海滨白人游民打交道，你总要付出点小代价才能和他们处得不错。他们很容易接近，交谈时总是很友善；他们很少摆架子，给他们买杯酒肯定就能让他们掏心掏肺，你不用费力和他们套近乎，如果你能认真地听他们天南海北地一通胡扯，你不仅能赢得他们的信任，而且还能让他们心怀感激。他们把聊闲天看作是生活中很大的乐趣，因此，他们往往用神侃证明他们教养的优异，他们当中的大多数人都是娱乐别人的侃爷。这些人的阅历很广，再加上想象力丰富，所以还是能侃出一些东西来的，不能说他们的话中没有吹嘘和欺骗的成分，但他们对法律能保持起码的尊重，尤其当法律能够得到有力的支持时，更是如此。跟他们一起玩扑克牌是危险的，但是他们的不老实反而给这种世界上最棒的游戏增添了特殊的刺激。在我离开塔希提岛之前，我和尼科尔斯船长已经很熟悉了，和他交往，我赚大了，我不认为掏钱请他抽雪茄、喝威士忌（他从不喝鸡尾酒，因为他是个滴酒不沾的人嘛）做了冤大头。有时他还会客客气气地跟我借上几美元，好像是给我面子，就这样这几美元从我兜里转到了他的口袋中。不管怎么说，这些付出对于他带给我的乐趣还是值得的。他其实是我的债主，如果我的良心坚持以死板的方式来处理这本书的写作，为了不跑题而寥寥几行字就把他打发掉的话，我会觉得对不起他的。

我不知道尼科尔斯船长最初为什么要离开英格兰，这件事他闭口不谈，跟他这种脾气的人相处，一些单刀直入的问题是非常欠考虑的。他的言谈中隐约透露出他受了不白之冤。毫无疑问，他把自己看成是非正义的受害者。我的想象总把这事跟诈骗和暴力之类的事相联系。当他说在英格兰的一些地方当局执法过于机械时，我总是充满同情地表示认可。我很高兴地看到，尽管在故土他经历了种种不愉快，但没有损伤他热情洋溢的爱国主义，他频频宣称英格兰是世界上最好的国家，觉得在美国人、殖民地人、达哥人[84]、荷兰人或是卡纳加人[85]面前，他还是高人一等的。

但我不认为他是个幸福的人。他患有消化不良症，人们经常看见他含着助消化的药片，在上午他的胃口通常很糟糕，但是光这一痛苦并不能损害他的精神，更令他痛苦的是生活的不如意。八年前，他草率地娶了老婆。对于有些男人，仁慈的上帝已经毫无疑问地判定他们过单身生活，但是他们有的人由于任性，有的人由于拗不过环境，却违背了上帝的意旨。没有什么事比结了婚但还做光棍这件事更令人同情的了，而尼科尔斯船长恰恰就碰上了这样的倒霉事。我见过他妻子，她是一个二十八岁的女人。我觉得有一类人，她们的年龄总是存疑，因为看上去她和二十岁时也没有什么不同，到了四十岁，看上去也不怎么老。她就是属于此类看不出年龄的女人。她留给我的印象是浑身上下都紧绷绷的：相貌平平的脸蛋，薄薄的嘴唇，看上去是紧绷绷的；皮肤包着骨头，是紧绷绷的；微笑是紧绷绷的；头发是紧绷绷的；衣服也是紧绷绷的。她穿的白色斜纹布衣服全然穿出了黑色孝衣的效果，我无法想象，尼科尔斯船长出于什么原因娶了她，而且娶过门之后竟然没有抛弃她，也许他时常打算抛弃她，可他的悲哀之处就在于总也不成功，不管他跑到多远的地方，也不管他的藏身之地是多么隐秘，我能肯定，尼科尔斯太太，就像命运一样，不屈不挠地如影随形，就像良知一样，毫无恻隐之心，很快就能找到他，黏上他。如同因离不开果，他也无法逃离她。

这个老江湖，就像艺术家，也许还有绅士一样，不属于哪一个阶级。他不会对无业游民的粗鲁[86]感到难堪，也不会对王公贵族的繁文缛节表示嘉许。但是尼科尔斯太太属于很有教养的阶层，最近名声日隆，被众人称为下中阶层。实际上，她的父亲是个警察，我敢肯定是办事很有效率的那一类，我不知道她为什么抓住船长不放手，但我肯定那不是因为爱情。我从未听她说过话，也许私下里她也挺能说。不管怎样，尼科尔斯船长怕她怕得要死。有时，他和我坐在宾馆的露台上，他也能感觉出她正走在外面的路上，她没搭理他，好像他完全不存在，只是镇定地踱来踱去。紧接着，一阵奇怪的不安笼罩着船长，他看了看表，发出一声叹息。

“好了，我该回去了。”他说道。

这个时候，什么俏皮话、什么威士忌都留不住他了。但他还是个男人，能够以大无畏的气概面对飓风和台风，只要有一把手枪，他会毫不犹豫地和十二个手无寸铁的黑人战斗。有时，尼科尔斯太太会派她的女儿，一个脸色苍白，但又阴沉着脸的七岁小女孩来宾馆。

“妈妈找你。”她带着哭腔说道。

“好的，好的，乖乖。”尼科尔斯船长赶忙答道。

他立马站起身来，陪着女儿沿路回去了。我想这是精神战胜物质的明证，所以我的跑题，至少还是有些寓意的好处的。





第四十七章


我试图把尼科尔斯船长告诉我的有关斯特里克兰的很多事情连接起来，在此我用最佳的顺序把它们好好梳理一下。船长和斯特里克兰的相识，是我和斯特里克兰在巴黎见了最后一面之后，大约是那年冬天的后半段。他俩认识之前的几个月，斯特里克兰怎么打发日子的我就不知道了，但我料想他的生活一定过得很艰辛，因为尼科尔斯船长第一次见到他是在夜晚收容所里，当时在马赛有一场罢工，而斯特里克兰已经山穷水尽身无分文，好像也不可能挣到一笔小钱来勉强糊口了。

夜晚收容所是一个石头砌成的大建筑，如果提供的证件齐全，他们就能说服管事的修道士相信他们都是能工作的人，那么穷人和流浪汉在这里就可以得到一张床，免费住上一周。在等着收容所大门开放的时候，尼科尔斯船长注意到了人群中斯特里克兰高大的身材和古怪的外表。人们无精打采地干等着，一些人来来回回地溜达，一些人斜靠在墙上，还有一些人坐在马路牙子上，脚耷拉在排水沟里。当他们排队鱼贯而入办公室时，尼科尔斯船长听到那位正验看斯特里克兰证件的修道士跟他用英语说了几句话，但船长没有找到机会和他说话。因为当船长一进入公共休息室，一位用胳膊夹着一大本圣经的修道士就跟着进来了，修道士登上房间尽头的讲坛开始布起道来，而那些悲惨的流浪汉们不得不忍受布道，作为他们住宿的代价。船长和斯特里克兰被分到了不同的房间里，第二天清晨大约五点钟，一个身材结实的修道士就把他们从床上叫了起来。当船长叠好被子洗完脸后，斯特里克兰已经不见了。尼科尔斯船长在凛冽的寒风中在街上逛了一个小时，然后走到一个水手们经常聚会的地方——维克托·耶鲁广场，在这儿他又发现了斯特里克兰，他正靠在一座雕像的底座上打盹呢。为了弄醒他，船长踢了他一脚。

“醒醒，来吃早饭吧，伙计。”他说道。

“滚一边去。”斯特里克兰不满地回答道。

我辨认出了我朋友有限的词汇量，这正是他常用的语气，我准备把尼科尔斯船长看作一个值得信赖的见证人了。

“一个子儿也没有了吧？”船长问道。

“滚你妈的蛋。”斯特里克兰回敬道。

“跟我走吧，我会给你弄点早饭的。”

经过片刻犹豫，斯特里克兰急忙站了起来，两人一起向面包救济所走去。在那里，饥饿的人会得到一片楔形的面包，他们必须在救济所里吃完，面包不允许带走。吃完面包，他们来到汤粥救济所，每天十一点到四点之间，可以在这儿领到一碗稀糊糊的咸粥，但只能喝一周。两个救济所的建筑相隔很远，只有快饿死的人才会忍不住两头跑。他们吃完早饭，查尔斯·斯特里克兰和尼科尔斯船长就算认识了，因此也开始了两人奇怪的交往。

他俩一起在马赛度过了大约四个月的时间，生活波澜不惊，没什么冒险活动——如果你脑海中的冒险就是指出人意料或者惊险刺激的事件的话。他们每天忙于挣点钱，晚上能找个地儿睡觉，找点吃的能够减弱饥饿的痛苦。但是，写到这儿我真希望能画出几幅图画，色彩丰富，活泼生动，尼科尔斯船长生动的叙述提供了想象的空间。他叙述他们两人在这个海港下层生活中的种种冒险经历，完全可以写成一本极有趣味的书，各种各样的人物竞相登场，学生们可以很容易地找到材料，编辑成一本全面的关于流浪汉的大辞典。然而，我用几个段落写写就已经心满意足了，我从他俩身上得到这种印象，生活是紧张、粗野、野蛮、色彩丰富和活泼的。而我所知道的马赛这座城市，人群熙熙攘攘，阳光明媚，到处是舒适的宾馆和人满为患的餐馆，有钱人充斥其中，可他们平淡无奇、庸庸碌碌，与他俩的生活相比，他们的生活黯然失色。所以，那些亲眼见过尼科尔斯船长描绘给我听的景象的人真是值得羡慕啊。

当夜晚收容所的门不再向斯特里克兰和尼科尔斯船长开放的时候，这两个人寻求住到“硬汉”比尔那里去。“硬汉”比尔是一家水手寄宿旅馆的老板，他是个身材魁梧，有着一双大拳头的黑白混血儿。他给失业的水手提供食物和住处，直到他们在船上找到活干为止。他们住在比尔那里有一个月了，在这儿投宿的还有另外十几个人，什么瑞典人、黑人、巴西人，大家睡在这栋房子的两个空荡荡房间的地板上，每个人睡的位置是比尔分配的。每天大家都跟着他一起到维克托·耶鲁广场去，这儿也是船长们找人手的地方。比尔娶了一个肥胖而又邋遢的美国女人，老天知道她怎么沦落到了这步田地。每天借宿的人都要轮流帮她做些家务活，斯特里克兰给“硬汉”比尔画了一幅肖像，作为免除做家务和寄宿费的代价，尼科尔斯船长认为这是一个聪明之举。在这场交易中，“硬汉”比尔不仅支付了画布、颜料和画笔的费用，而且还给了斯特里克兰一磅走私的烟草。就我所知，这幅画可能还在装饰着那栋摇摇欲坠的小楼房的客厅，这栋楼房就在拉·乔利埃特码头附近，我想这幅画现在能卖到一千五百英镑了。斯特里克兰的想法是先搭船前往澳大利亚或者新西兰，然后再转途到萨摩亚或塔希提岛。我不知道他怎么想到去南太平洋的，虽然我还记得他长久以来魂牵梦萦的梦想就是到一座小岛上去，小岛郁郁葱葱，阳光明媚，四周环海，海水比北部纬度的任何海洋都要湛蓝。我想他和尼科尔斯船长摽在一起，就是因为后者对南太平洋的大部分水域都很熟悉。也恰恰是尼科尔斯船长说服他，如果去了塔希提岛，他会更舒适些。

“你知道，塔希提岛是法国人的领土，”尼科尔斯船长跟我解释说，“而法国人办事不是他妈的那么机械。”

我想我明白了他话中的含意。

斯特里克兰没有什么证件，但是只要有钱可赚（“硬汉”比尔会把在船上找到差事的水手第一个月的薪水揣入自己的腰包），这事对于“硬汉”比尔来说根本不是事儿，当时正好他给提供食宿的一群人中，有个英国司炉工死了，“硬汉”比尔就把他的证件给了斯特里克兰。斯特里克兰和尼科尔斯船长两个人打算往东去，可不巧当时只有在向西航行的船上能有找到差事的机会。斯特里克兰两次拒绝在开往美国的船上所提供的职位，一次拒绝了开往纽卡斯尔煤船[87]上的职位。“硬汉”比尔可没有耐心对待这种执拗，因为结果只能让他破财。他一分钟也没多耽搁就把斯特里克兰和尼科尔斯船长赶出了他的家门，他俩再一次流落街头了。

“硬汉”比尔提供的伙食谈不上丰盛，你从餐桌前站起身来几乎和坐下去时一样的饥饿，但是有好几天，他们都有理由后悔没能在那里再待下去，他们领教了饥饿的真正滋味。汤粥救济所和夜晚收容所都对这俩人关上了大门，他们只能靠在面包救济所里得到的一块面包果腹。找到能睡觉的地方，倒头就睡，有时睡在火车站岔道上的空车皮里，有时睡在仓库后面运货的大车里；但天气刺骨的寒冷，在迷迷糊糊打了一两个小时的盹后，他们又会回到大街上流浪。让他们感到最难受的是没有烟抽，对尼科尔斯船长来说，更是如此。他会到小酒馆里去捡前一天晚上闲逛的人扔掉的烟屁股和雪茄头。

“我用烟斗吸过更糟糕的杂七杂八的玩意儿。”他补充了一句，故作深沉地耸了耸肩，一边从我递给他的烟盒里拿了一大把雪茄，然后，把一支烟叼到嘴上，剩下的装入口袋。

偶尔他俩也能挣到一点儿钱，有时一艘邮轮停靠码头，尼科尔斯船长有办法和船上的计时员套套近乎，成功地为他俩找到一份装卸工的活儿。有时碰上一艘英国船，他们会偷偷溜进前甲板下面的水手舱，混在水手堆里开心地大吃一顿。当然这么做也有风险，如果撞上船上管事的，就会被从舷梯上轰下来，为了催他们快滚，屁股上还免不了会挨上几脚。

“肚子吃饱了，屁股上挨上一脚也算不上什么伤害，”尼科尔斯船长说道，“从我个人的角度上看，我从不把它往坏处想，管事的不得不考虑船上的纪律。”

我的脑海出现了一幅活灵活现的画面，尼科尔斯船长在愤怒的大副抬脚之前，飞快地沿着狭窄舷梯屁滚尿流地跑了下来，但是，就像一个真正的英国人，对英国商船队的纪律严明还是满心欢喜的。

他们经常能在鱼市找到一些零活干干。还有一次，码头上卸下了很多箱橘子，他们把这些箱子装到卡车上，每人各自挣到了一法郎。一天他们撞上了大运，有一家寄宿店的老板揽到一单生意，要给一艘从马达加斯加开来，绕过好望角的货轮刷油漆，他们站在悬挂在船体一侧的厚木板上，花了好几天的时间给生锈的船体刷上油漆，这情景一定很合斯特里克兰习惯冷嘲热讽的胃口。我问尼科尔斯船长，斯特里克兰在这些困顿的日子里，有什么样的反应。

“从没听他说过一句丧气话，”船长回答道，“他有时脾气会不太好，但是我们从早到晚没吃上一口，我们没能谈妥价钱在中国佬的店里睡上一晚的时候，他都像蟋蟀一样蹦蹦跳跳。”

对此，我一点儿也不感到吃惊，因为斯特里克兰正是一个超然物外的人，就是在最容易丧失勇气的情况下也能坦然处之。这到底是由于灵魂的平和，还是矛盾的对立，就很难说清了。

“中国佬厕所”是海滨游民们给一家位于布特里路附近寒碜小客栈的称呼，这家店是一个独眼的中国人开的。六个铜板可以睡在一张小床上，三个铜板睡在地板上。在这里，他们结交了不少和他们一样穷困潦倒的人。当他们身无分文，夜晚也格外寒冷的时候，他们高兴地向白天挣到一个法郎的人借些钱，支付住宿费。这些流浪汉一点儿也不吝啬，只要他们有了点儿钱，会毫不犹豫地和大家分享。他们来自世界上的不同国家，但是大家都是见面熟，因为他们觉得自己是某个国度的自由人，这个国度的疆界包括了他们所在的国家，这个伟大的国度名叫安乐乡。

“但是，我想如果斯特里克兰被惹翻了，他可不是个善茬。”尼科尔斯船长若有所思地说，“有一天，我们在广场上碰到了‘硬汉’比尔，他向查理索要给他的那些证件。”

“如果你想要的话，你最好亲自来我住的地方拿。”查理说道。

“‘硬汉’比尔可是个霸道的家伙，他不是很喜欢查理的样子，所以他开始咒骂查理，把肚子里所有脏话的存货都抖了出来，所以只要‘硬汉’比尔开始张嘴骂人，还是值得一听的。查理耐着性子听了一会儿，然后向前走了几步，凑到他的跟前说道：‘给我滚远点，你他妈的这头蠢猪。’他说的话不多，但说话的方式着实吓人，‘硬汉’比尔没再说一个字，你能看见他脸色变得蜡黄，掉头离开了，好像突然记起他有一个约会。”

按照尼科尔斯船长的叙述，斯特里克兰当时骂人的话和我所写出的并不完全一样，考虑到这本书打算作为家庭读物，我想还是最好，哪怕是牺牲点儿真实性，也要把他嘴里说出的话稍作改动，变成雅俗共赏的字眼，这样才适合在家庭圈子里传阅。

话又说回来，“硬汉”比尔可不是个受了一个普通水手的侮辱而忍气吞声的人，他的威势全仰仗他是个狠角色的名声，最初有一个，后来又有一个住在“硬汉”比尔寄宿店的水手告诉他俩，“硬汉”比尔发誓要把斯特里克兰做掉。

一天晚上，尼科尔斯船长和斯特里克兰正坐在布特里路的一家小酒吧里。布特里路是一条狭窄的街道，街道两旁全是一间间的平房，每个平房就一个单间，它们就像拥挤集市上的摊位或者马戏团里关动物的笼子。在每一个门口都能看见一个女人，有的懒洋洋地靠在门框上，自己哼着小曲或者用沙哑的嗓音招呼着路人，还有的无精打采地看着画报。她们当中有法国人、意大利人、西班牙人、日本人，还有各种肤色的人，有的胖，有的瘦，脸上涂着厚厚的脂粉，眉毛描得很重，嘴唇也抹得鲜红，你能看出岁月在她们脸上刻下的痕迹，堕落放荡后留下的疤痕。有的人穿着黑色的内衣和肉色长袜，有的人头发卷曲，染成了黄色，穿着短短的薄纱连衣裙，像个小姑娘似的。透过开着的门，你能看到屋里的红砖地，一张大木床，牌桌上摆着大口水罐和脸盆。形形色色的人沿着街道在闲荡——邮轮上的印度水手，瑞典三桅帆船上的金发北欧人，军舰上的日本人，英国的水手，西班牙人，法国巡洋舰上英俊的水兵，美国货船上的黑人。白天，这条小街脏乱不堪，可到了夜晚，在小屋里的灯光照耀下，这条街竟然有种罪恶的美丽。丑恶的淫欲弥漫在空气中，压抑而可怕，然而在这幅挥之不去，困扰你的景象中有种神秘的东西，你会感到有一种说不出来的原始力量把你推开，却同时又吸引着你。在这里，一切文明的体面都荡然无存，你感觉人们在和阴郁的现实面对面地打交道，氛围立刻变得紧张和充满悲剧性。

在斯特里克兰和尼科尔斯船长就座的酒吧里，有一架自动钢琴声音很大地播放着舞曲，屋子四周人们都围坐在桌子旁，这边有六七个水手醉醺醺地大喊大叫，那边有一群士兵。在屋子中央，人们一对对挤在一起跳舞。胡子拉碴的水手，脸被晒得黢黑，用粗糙结实的大手紧紧地搂着舞伴，女人们身上只穿了内衣。时不时，两个水手也起身跳起舞来。喧闹声震耳欲聋，人们唱着、喊着、笑着；当一个男人长时间地亲吻坐在他腿上的女孩时，那些英国水手像叫猫似的喊叫，就更加重了屋里的嘈杂。空气很浑浊，男人们沉重的大皮靴踩踏出的尘土，抽烟喷出的烟雾，搞得到处乌烟瘴气。屋里很热，吧台后面坐着一个女人正在给孩子喂奶。侍者身材矮小，有着一张扁平、长满雀斑的脸，端着摆了啤酒杯的托盘，急匆匆地来来回回跑。

过了一会儿，“硬汉”比尔在两个身材高大的黑人陪同下，走了进来。一眼就可以看出来他有好几分醉意了，是故意来找事的。他摇摇晃晃地撞到了一张桌子，三个士兵正坐在桌子边，打翻了一杯啤酒，双方发生了激烈的争吵。酒吧的老板走上前来，命令“硬汉”比尔离开，老板的块头也很大，习惯上容不得他的顾客闹事。“硬汉”比尔迟疑着，这个店主不是个他轻易敢动的主儿，因为他有警察撑腰，比尔骂了一句，想转身离开。突然，他看见了斯特里克兰，东倒西歪地走到他跟前，一句话没说，他嘬了一口痰，吐了斯特里克兰一脸。斯特里克兰抄起酒杯向他扔去，跳舞的人都突然停下不动了，片刻之间，屋里变得鸦雀无声。随着“硬汉”比尔扑向斯特里克兰，所有人身上好斗的欲望都被激发了，一会儿工夫，酒吧里开始了一场混战，桌子被掀翻了，杯子掉到地上摔得粉碎，地狱似的吵闹。女人们四散奔向大门，有的躲到吧台后面。路人从街上蜂拥进来，你能听见咒骂声一片，拳击声、喊叫声四起，在屋子中央，十几个人正全力扭打在一起。突然，警察冲进来了，所有的人都争先恐后地往门口蹿，当酒吧或多或少不那么混乱了，人们发现“硬汉”比尔正躺在地板上，失去了知觉，头上裂了一道大口子。尼科尔斯船长生拉硬拽地把斯特里克兰拖到街上，后者的胳膊上有一道伤口，正流着血，衣服也被撕扯得破烂不堪。尼科尔斯船长自己脸上也满是鲜血，他的鼻子上挨了一拳。

“我想你最好在‘硬汉’比尔出院之前离开马赛。”当他们回到“中国佬厕所”寄宿店清洗血迹时，尼科尔斯船长对斯特里克兰说道。

“这比斗鸡带劲多了。”斯特里克兰说。

我好像看见他脸上露出了讥讽的微笑。

尼科尔斯船长忧心忡忡，因为他知道“硬汉”比尔的恶毒。斯特里克兰两次让这个混血儿吃了亏。而这个混血儿在清醒的时候，可是要小心提防的，他会伺机而动，他会不慌不忙地下黑手。说不定哪天晚上，斯特里克兰背上就会挨上一刀，一两天之后，一个无名海滨游民的尸体就会被从港口的脏水里打捞上来。尼科尔斯第二天傍晚去“硬汉”比尔的寄宿店打探消息，他还在医院，但他的妻子已经去看过他了，据她说比尔发下了毒誓，一旦他出了院，就会杀了斯特里克兰。

一周过去了。

“那就是我常说的话，”尼科尔斯船长回忆说，“你要是揍一个人，就要把他揍得半死，这样才会有点时间让你看一下形势，考虑一下下一步该怎么走。”

那时，斯特里克兰还是很有些运气的，一艘开往澳大利亚的船派人到“水手之家”找一个司炉工，取代原来的司炉工。原来的司炉工在船过直布罗陀海峡时精神错乱，纵身跳下了轮船。

“你一刻也别耽误，快到码头去，我的伙计。”尼科尔斯船长对斯特里克兰说道，“正好你有证件，赶紧在合同上签上名吧。”

斯特里克兰立即就出发了，那是尼科尔斯船长见他的最后一面。船只在港口停留六个小时。当天傍晚时分，尼科尔斯船长看着轮船烟囱中冒出的烟渐渐消失，船穿过冬天的大海，劈波斩浪向东而去。

我已经尽我所能，把所有细节都叙述出来了，因为我想把这些生动的故事和我亲眼所见的斯特里克兰在阿什利花园的生活做对比，那时他整天忙于股票生意，但是我又清楚尼科尔斯船长是个满嘴跑火车的家伙，我敢说他告诉我的这些事，可能一句真话都没有，如果我了解到他一辈子都没见过斯特里克兰，他对马赛的熟悉来自于杂志，我也毫不吃惊。





第四十八章


我原打算到这儿就结束我这本书的内容，我最初的想法是，在书的开头部分叙述斯特里克兰在塔希提岛上的最后岁月，以及他可怕的死亡。然后再倒叙，讲述我所知道的他早年的生活，这是我的初衷，倒不是我任性，而是因为我想让斯特里克兰带着我所不了解的，他孤独心灵中的幻想出发到一个未知的岛屿，这座岛屿能够点燃他的想象力。我喜欢他的这样一幅画面，在四十七岁的年纪开始画画，而这个年龄大多数男人已经安顿下来，在老婆孩子热炕头的舒服生活中度日，可他却在寻找一个新世界。我好像能够看见他伫立在船头，目光凝视灰蒙蒙的大海，迎面是凛冽的北风，浪花四溅，远眺渐渐消失的法国海岸线，命中注定他再也看不见这些景象了。我想他的举止中有种豪迈气概，心灵中有种无畏精神。我希望这样来做结尾，留下某种希望，这样写似乎强调了人类不可征服的精神，但是我发现自己无法驾驭它，某种程度上，我不能很好地理清这个故事，尝试了一两次以后，我不得不放弃了；我在故事的开头就用了通常的方式，并暗自决定我只讲述我所知道的斯特里克兰的生活，我所了解的事实怎样，就按顺序把它原原本本地写出来。

对于那些现在看来只是不完整片断的事实，我就力求站在一名生物学家的角度，从一根骨头上，不仅要重构一个已经灭绝了的动物的外表，还要还原它的生活习性。斯特里克兰没有给在塔希提岛上跟他有联系的人留下任何特殊的印象，对他们来说，他只不过是个经济上持续窘迫的游民，能够多少让人注意的是，他能画几幅画的特殊才能，而这些画对于他们来说，是荒诞不经的。直到他死了若干年以后，来自巴黎和柏林画商的代理人们来寻找可能仍然遗留在岛上他的画作，岛上的人才知道，在他们当中曾经生活过一位伟大的人物，他们才想起来，如果当初他们能花一点点钱买上几幅他的画，现在可值相当一大笔钱了，他们简直无法原谅自己白白让这样一个好机会溜掉了。岛上有一位犹太生意人名叫科恩，用不同寻常的方式弄到过斯特里克兰的一幅画。科恩是个法国籍的小老头，有着一双柔和、善良的眼睛和令人愉快的微笑，半是商人，半是水手，自己有一艘快艇，他开着快艇勇敢地在包莫图斯群岛、马克萨斯和塔希提群岛之间来回穿梭，给当地运去需要的商品，带回椰子干、贝壳和珍珠。我想去找他，因为有人告诉我他有一颗很大的黑珍珠，他愿意很便宜地出手，但是当我发现，他的要价还是超出了我的支付能力时，我开始跟他谈论起斯特里克兰来了，发现他跟斯特里克兰很熟。

“你知道，我对他感兴趣是因为他是个画家，”他告诉我，“没有多少画家肯到我们岛上来，我很可怜他，因为他是个蹩脚的画家，我给了他第一份工作。我在半岛上有一个种植园，想请一个白人做监工。除非你有一个白人监督着本地人，否则的话，这些当地人从来不出活儿。我对他说：‘你会有很多时间画画，你能挣上一笔钱。’我知道他都快饿死了，但我还是给了他不错的薪水。”

“我想他不会是一个很令人满意的监工。”我笑着说。

“我已经够体谅他了，我一向对艺术家充满同情，你知道，我们家的传统就是这样。但是他只干了几个月，当攒够钱可以买颜料和画布的时候，他就离开了我。那时，有个地方让他着迷，他想离开跑到树林里去。但我还能时不时地看到他，每隔几个月他就会在帕皮提露面，待上一小段时间；一旦他从某个人那里搞到钱，就会再次消失。来帕皮提的几次中，有一次他来找我，请求我贷给他二百法郎的款子，他看上去有一周都没吃上饭了，我不忍心拒绝他，当然了，我也从没指望我的钱还能回来。哦，一年之后，他又一次来找我，随身还带着一幅画，他没有提欠我钱的事儿，但是他说：‘这儿有一幅你种植园的画，我专门为你画的。’我看了看这幅画，不知道说什么好，可我还是谢了他。他走了以后，我把这幅画拿给我妻子看。”

“‘你瞧这幅画怎么样？’”我问道。

“‘你别问我，我根本看不懂它，我这辈子从没见过这种东西。’‘那我们拿它怎么办呢？’我问妻子。‘我们绝不能把它挂起来。’她说道，‘别人会笑话我们的。’因为我妻子没有扔东西的习惯，这是她的癖好，所以她把它拿到阁楼上，扔进了杂物堆中。接下来，你自己都可以想象，就在战争爆发前，我哥哥在巴黎给我写信，信上说：‘你知道一个生活在塔希提岛上的英国人的事吗？好像他是个天才，他的画现在能卖大价钱，看看你能不能弄到他画的任何东西，把它寄给我，我们有钱可赚。’于是，我对我妻子说：‘那幅斯特里克兰送我的画怎么样了？有可能还在阁楼上吗？’‘百分之百在，’她回答说，‘我是绝不扔任何东西的，这一点你是知道的，这是我的癖好。’我们爬到阁楼上——我们住在这栋房子里已经有三十年了，在这三十年中我都不知道我们积攒下了多少破烂——终于在一堆杂物中找到了那幅画。我又一次端详这幅画，说道：‘谁会想到我们在半岛种植园里的监工，我还借过他二百法郎，竟然是个天才？你能看出这幅画哪点画得好吗？’‘我看不出来，’她说道，‘它一点也不像我们的种植园，而且我也从来没见过长着蓝叶子的椰子树，但是在巴黎的那些人都疯了，也许你哥哥能把它卖上个二百法郎，正好抵上你借给斯特里克兰的钱。’无论如何，我们把它打包寄给了我哥哥。最后，我们收到一封他的回信。你猜他信上写了什么？‘我收到了你寄来的画，’他说，‘我得实话实说，一开始我还以为你在跟我开玩笑，为这样一幅画，我真不应该花上邮寄费，我忐忑不安地把它拿给曾向我说起这事的先生看。当他说这幅画是个杰作，愿意出价三万法郎买它时，你能想象出我的震惊吗？我敢说我要是出再高的价他也会接受的，可是说实话，当时我被惊得目瞪口呆，脑筋根本转不过来了，在我回过神之前，我就接受了他的报价。’”

随后，科恩先生又说了几句让人刮目相看的话。

“我真希望可怜的斯特里克兰还活着呢，当我把二万九千八百法郎卖他画的钱给他时，真不知道他会说些什么。”





第四十九章


我住在鲜花宾馆，约翰逊太太是这家宾馆的女老板，她总是向人诉说她痛失良机的悲伤故事。在斯特里克兰死后，他的一些遗物在帕皮提的市场上被拍卖。她亲自跑了一趟，因为在拍卖品中有一个美国造的炉子她想要，她付了二十七法郎购得这个炉子。

“那儿还有十几幅画，”她告诉我，“但是这些画都没画框，没人想要它们，有些画最多十法郎就卖掉了，但大多数画只卖到五六个法郎，你想想看，如果我当初买下它们，现在就成富婆了。”

但是蒂亚瑞·约翰逊无论在什么情况下也成不了富婆的，她存不住钱。她的母亲是一个当地的女人，父亲是一个定居在塔希提岛上的英国船长。当我认识她时，她已经有五十岁上下，但看上去更老，非常的富态，个头高大，特别胖，如果不是一张脸上透出慈祥，而且充满善意的话，看上去会是威风凛凛的。她的胳膊就像小羊腿，乳房就像两棵巨大的洋白菜，大脸盘子满是肥肉，给你一种印象，几乎像是不太雅观的裸体，肥肥的下巴一层叠着一层，我都不知道究竟有多少层。肥大的下巴都垂到了宽宽的胸脯上。她通常穿着粉色的罩衫，整天戴着一顶大草帽。但是当她把头发松垂下来的时候——她时不时地这样做，因为她对自己的头发很是自鸣得意——你能看到她的头发很长，乌黑而且卷曲着；她的眼睛还保持青春色彩和活泼灵动，她的笑声是我所听到过的笑声中最吸引人的，刚开始笑的时候，好像喉咙中有颗位置较低的珍珠，然后笑声越来越大，直到她整个硕大的身躯都开始在晃动了。她平生有三爱——笑话、葡萄酒和帅哥。能结识她，真是三生有幸。

她还是岛上最好的厨师，喜欢美食。从早到晚，你都能看见她坐在厨房的矮椅子上，一名中国厨师和两三个当地的女孩围着她转，她一边在发号施令，一边同所有各色人等聊着天，还一边品尝她设计出的各种美食。当她想对一位朋友表示一下敬意的时候，会亲自下厨露上两手。好客是她的天性，但凡鲜花宾馆有一口吃的，岛上的人就不用担心晚饭没有着落。她绝对不会因为客人付不起账单而把他们赶出宾馆。她总有一种希望，当他们能付得起的时候，他们一定会付清的。有一次一个住店的男人落魄了，她一连好几个月给这个人提供食宿。当一个中国洗衣工因为这个客人付不起洗衣费而拒绝再给他洗衣服时，她把他的衣服和自己的衣服裹在一起送到洗衣房。她无法容忍这位贫穷的家伙穿着脏衬衣出门。她说，既然他是个男人，而男人非抽烟不可，她每天会给他一法郎去买烟。她对这个客人和那些一周一次准时付账单的客人一样和蔼客气。

她的年龄和过度肥胖使她不能再谈情说爱了，但她对年轻人的恋爱和浪漫事却格外感兴趣，认为情欲是饮食男女天然的需要，甚至还时刻准备着以自己这方面丰富的阅历作为箴言总结和行为榜样。

“我还不到十五岁的时候，我父亲就发现我有了一个情人。”她说，“他是热带鸟号船上的三副，长得很帅气。”

她轻轻叹了口气，他们说女人总是会念念不忘她的第一个情人。然而，也许她是个例外，不能总记得清他的模样。

“我父亲是个明智的人。”

“他做了什么了？”我问道。

“他几乎把我揍个半死，差点要了我的命。后来，他又把我嫁给了约翰逊船长，我并不介意，虽然他岁数要大得多，当然了，他长得也很不错。”

蒂亚瑞——她父亲给她取的这个名字，意思是白色的、有香味的花朵，这里的人们告诉你，如果你闻过一次它的花香，最终总会被吸引到塔希提岛，无论你漂泊得有多远——蒂亚瑞对斯特里克兰记得非常清楚。

“他过去有时来这儿，我也曾见他在帕皮提来回溜达，我挺可怜他，他那么瘦，口袋里从来没有半毛钱。只要我听说他在镇上，我经常会派侍者去找他，让他来和我一起吃饭。我也给过他一两份工作，但他坚持不了多久，过一段时间他就想重返丛林，说不定哪天早上自己说回就回了。”

斯特里克兰在离开马赛大约六个月后来到了塔希提岛，他在一艘从奥克兰开往旧金山的帆船上做水手。他到达时，随身带着一盒颜料、一个画架和十几张画布。他口袋里有一些英镑，是他在悉尼打零工挣的，他在镇外一个当地人的房子里租了一个小房间。我认为在他踏上塔希提岛的那一刻，他找到了家的感觉。蒂亚瑞告诉我，有一次斯特里克兰对她说：

“我一直在擦洗甲板，突然间有个家伙对我说：‘嗨，就在那儿。’我抬起头，看到一片岛的轮廓，我马上知道那个地方就是我这辈子一直在苦苦寻找的地方，当我们靠得近了一些的时候，我似乎认出了它。有时候当我在岛上四处溜达的时候，周围的一切都是那么熟悉，我敢发誓我以前一定在这儿生活过。”

“有时，这个小岛确实能给人这种感觉，”蒂亚瑞说道，“我就听说过，一些船正在上货，有些水手登岸待上几个小时后，就再也没有回到船上。我还听说有些人来这儿任职一年，他们对这个地方骂骂咧咧，离开时发下毒誓，宁可上吊也不回来了。可再过六个月，你却会再次看到他们上岸，而且他们会告诉你他们在别的地方简直生活不下去。”





第五十章


我有种看法，一些人出生在了本不属于他们的地方。偶然的事件把他们置于特定的环境中，但是他们对于他们自己都不知道的家园总有一种思乡之情。对于出生地而言，他们反而成了陌生人，从孩童时期他们就熟知的铺满落叶的小巷，或者他们曾经玩耍过的熙熙攘攘的街道，对他们来说，都只不过是人生旅途中的一站罢了。在他们的亲友中度过了整个人生，却还形单影只，在他们熟悉的场景中仍感到孤独落寞。也许正是这种陌生感，使得人们满世界去寻找某种永恒的东西，这种永恒的东西成为他们的依附之所。说不定某种根深蒂固的返祖现象驱策着浮萍般的漫游者重回故地，这块土地是他的祖先在远古时代一片混沌中离开的。有时一个人碰巧来到一个冥冥之中他感到是自己所属的地方，这儿是他寻找的家园，他在前所未见的场景中驻扎下去，在他从未见过的人当中安顿下来，好像他从出生的那一刻起，就跟这些人很熟悉。最后，就是在这儿，他找到了安息之所。

我给蒂亚瑞讲了一个我在圣托马斯医院所认识的人的故事。他是一个犹太人，名叫亚伯拉罕。他是个一头金发、相当结实的年轻人。性格腼腆，十分谦逊，但是他有很突出的能力。他是带着奖学金进入医院实习的，在五年的课程学习中，囊括了所有他有资格参评的奖项。他先后当了住院内科医生、住院外科医生。他的才华有目共睹，得到大家的一致认可。最后，他被选举进了医院的领导层，事业蒸蒸日上，只要世事可料，就完全可以肯定，他会爬到这个行业的最高层，各种荣誉和财富在向他招手。在他就任新的岗位之前，他希望去度个假，由于他自己没钱，他在一艘开往黎凡特[88]的不定期货轮找了个住船医生的临时活儿。一般来说，这种货轮上是没有医生的，只因这家医院一位资深的医生认识这条航线上的主管，于是亚伯拉罕利用这层便利条件得到了这个职位。

几周之后，医院当局就接到了亚伯拉罕的辞职信，宣称放弃多少人梦寐以求的职位。大家在震惊之余，传闻沸沸扬扬。无论什么时候，只要有人做出什么出人意料的举动，他身边的人就会把这种举动归因于最难以置信的动机。但是，准备填补亚伯拉罕位置的大有人在，很快他就被人们遗忘了。从此以后，他也杳无音讯，就像在地球上消失了一般。

过了大约十年，有一天上午，我乘船去亚历山大港。按照吩咐我和其他乘客一起排队等着医生的检查。这个医生是个矮壮的人，穿得破破烂烂。当他脱掉帽子的时候，我注意到他的头已经全秃了。一闪念间，我觉得以前好像在哪里见过他。突然，我记起来了。

“亚伯拉罕。”我叫道。

他满脸困惑地转向我，随后，也认出了我，一把抓住了我的手。我们两个一通他乡遇故知的惊喜表白之后，知道我打算在亚历山大港待一个晚上，亚伯拉罕邀请我和他一起去一家英国人的俱乐部共进晚餐。到了晚上，我们再次碰面的时候，我表示在这儿遇见他让我感到很吃惊，他现在的职位很低微，而且好像日子过得也很窘迫。接下来，他向我讲述了自己的故事。当他出发去地中海度假的时候，本是打算度完假后，就回伦敦到圣托马斯医院上班。一天清晨，当船停泊在亚历山大港，他从甲板上眺望这座城市，在阳光中，城市呈现一片白色，码头上熙熙攘攘；他还看到穿着破烂长袍[89]的当地人，从苏丹来的黑人，吵吵闹闹成群结队的希腊人和意大利人，戴着塔布什帽[90]、表情严肃的土耳其人。在阳光和蓝天下，他心中有种东西触动了自己，这种东西他说不清，道不明，他说道，就像平地里的一声惊雷。然后，他好像不满意这种说法，他又说，像某种天启。这种东西在他心中纠结，突然他感到一阵狂喜，一种美妙的、自由的感觉，觉得回到了故国家园，当时当地，他很快就下定了决心，要在亚历山大港度过他的余生。他没费什么周折就离开了那艘船，二十四小时后，带着他的所有行李物品，他已经到了岸上。

“船长一定觉得你完全疯了。”我笑着说。

“我不在乎别人怎么想，好像不是我自己在行动，而是我灵魂中更为强大的东西在驱使我这样做。我四下观望，觉得应该去一家小希腊旅馆，好像我知道路怎么走，你知道，我直接就走到了那里，当我看见这家旅馆时，我马上就认出了它。”

“你以前来过亚历山大港？”

“没来过，我以前从没离开过英格兰。”

很快他在一个政府服务部门找到了工作，从那以后他就一直待在那里了。

“你后悔过吗？”

“没有，一分钟也没有过，我的收入仅够糊口，但是我很满足。我别无所求，只希望这样生活，直到我死去，我过着一种自己想要的生活。”

第二天我就离开了亚历山大港，也快忘了亚伯拉罕的事了，直到不久前，我和从事医疗行当的另外一位老朋友吃饭时，才又想了起来。我这位老朋友叫艾列克·卡米歇尔，当时回来在英国短期度假，我在街上偶然遇见了他，并祝贺他因为战时卓越的贡献而获封爵士称号。我们俩打算找一天晚上好好叙叙旧，我答应和他一块儿吃个饭，他也提议为了不被打扰，别的人他都不叫了，就我们俩。他在安妮女王大街有一栋古老的漂亮房子，作为一个品味高雅的人，他把房子拾掇得让人艳羡。在餐厅四周的墙上，我看见一幅迷人的贝洛托[91]的画，还有两幅让我羡慕不已的佐范尼[92]的画。他的妻子个头高挑，身着金光闪闪的衣服，长相讨人喜欢，跟我打了个招呼就离开了。我笑着打趣他说，和我们俩还是医学院的穷酸学生时相较，他已经是鸟枪换炮，今非昔比了。我们俩上学时如果能在位于威斯敏斯特桥大街的一家寒酸的意大利小餐馆里撮上一顿，都觉得太过奢侈。现在，艾列克在六七家医院做特聘医生，我想他一年能收入一万英镑，他的爵士封号只不过是众多荣誉的开端罢了，以后这样的荣誉肯定会滚滚而来。

“我混得不错，”他说，“不过，奇怪的是，我所得到的这一切归于一次好运气。”

“你这话是什么意思？”

“好吧，你还记得亚伯拉罕吧？他本来是前途无量的，我们还是学生时，他的成绩一直压着我，我孜孜以求的各种奖项和奖学金都被他拿了。我总是落后他一步，如果他继续干下去，我今天的位置就是他的了。这家伙简直就是拿手术刀的天才，没人能跟他一决高下。他被任命为圣托马斯医院的主治医生时，我根本还没有机会进入医院，我只能做个全科医生，你也知道全科医生当时是什么样的状态，我甚至都无法逃脱全科医生最终的老路。但是亚伯拉罕给我让出了位置，我得到了那份本属于他的工作。从那以后，我就时来运转了。”

“这倒真是这么回事。”

“这就是运气，我想亚伯拉罕不定自己纠结什么事呢，可怜的家伙，他从此一蹶不振了。他在亚历山大港的医疗部门找了一份工作——检疫员之类的活儿，挣个三核俩枣的。有人告诉我说，他和一个又老又丑的希腊娘们生活在一起，生了六七个长得疙里疙瘩的孩子。我觉得，事实上，光是脑子好使还不够，起决定作用的还是性格，亚伯拉罕性格上就有缺陷。”

性格？我应该能想到，正是因为太有性格了，所以只经过半个小时的思考，就把一个好端端的事业给扔了。因为你看到了另一种生活方式更加有意义，而且它要求有更多的性格，才绝不会后悔所迈出的突然的一步。但是我什么也没说，而艾列克·卡米歇尔继续若有所思地说：

“当然啦，如果我假装为亚伯拉罕所做的一切感到惋惜的话，我就太虚伪了，毕竟，我从中得到太多的好处。”他抽着一支长长的克罗纳牌雪茄烟，惬意地吐着烟圈，“但是，如果不是从个人的角度考虑这个问题，我还是为这个天才的荒废感到难过，一个人把生活搞成这样一团乱麻，似乎是糟糕透顶的事情。”

我倒是想知道亚伯拉罕是否真的把生活搞成了一团乱麻。做自己最想做的事，在某种条件下，过一种让自己最开心的生活，自己始终处于淡泊宁静之中，难道就是生活成了乱麻吗？而且，成为一名年收入一万英镑的著名外科医生，再娶上一个漂亮的太太，难道就是成功的标志吗？我想这取决于你对生活赋予什么意义，取决于你对社会应尽什么义务，取决于你对自己有什么要求。然而，我再次保持了缄默，因为我怎么可以和一名爵士去争辩什么呢？





第五十一章


当我跟蒂亚瑞讲了这个故事后，她称赞了我的精明。我俩正在剥豆子，有好一段时间，我俩都在默默地干手里的活儿。一会儿后，因为她的眼睛总是瞄着厨房里的事情，看到那个中国厨师的某个举动让她大为不满，便转向他连珠炮似的大骂了一阵子，而那个中国佬也不甘示弱，为自己申辩着，接着更为激烈的争吵爆发了。他们是用本地话唇枪舌战，我虽然学过一些本地话，但也就能听懂十几个词，听上去好像世界很快就到末日了。可不大会儿工夫，又恢复了和平，蒂亚瑞给了这个厨子一支香烟，他们俩悠闲地抽起了烟。

“你知道吗？ 是我给他找了个老婆。”蒂亚瑞突然开口说道，一张大脸盘子上堆满了笑容。

“这个厨子吗？”

“不是，是斯特里克兰。”

“可是他已经有妻子了。”

“他也这么说，可我告诉他，他老婆在英格兰，而英格兰远在天边呢。”

“这倒是。”我回答道。

“当他需要颜料或烟草，或者缺钱时，每隔两三个月就要来一次帕皮提，随后就像一条丧家之犬似的游荡，我很可怜他。我这儿有个女孩名叫爱塔，是帮我打扫房间的，还是我的一个远房亲戚，她的父母都去世了，所以我把她接来跟我一起生活。斯特里克兰过去时不时地来我这儿撮上一顿饱饭，或者跟我的某个伙计下下棋。我注意到每次他来时，她都看着他。于是我就问她，是不是喜欢上他了。她说很喜欢他。你知道这些女孩子的脾气，她们总是愿意和一个白人走在一起。”

“她是本地人吗？”我问道。

“是的，她身上没有一滴白人的血液。嗯，我跟她谈完后，就派人去找斯特里克兰，然后我对他说：‘斯特里克兰，你是时候该安顿下来了，像你这样年纪的男人不应该老去找那些码头边上的女人鬼混了。这些女人不是什么好东西，跟她们在一起对你没什么好处。你又没钱，一份工作你从来没做到超过一两个月的，现在也没人愿意雇你了。你说可以跟一两个本地人老是住在丛林里，他们也高兴和你住在一起，因为你是个白人，但是这对于一个白人来说是不体面的。现在你听我说，斯特里克兰。’”

在她的话中，蒂亚瑞一会儿说法语，一会儿又说英语，因为她两种语言都运用自如。她用一种唱歌的腔调说着双语，听上去倒也悦耳。你会觉得如果一只鸟儿能说英语的话，它一定也是用的这种腔调。

“‘现在，你说，你把爱塔娶了怎么样？她是个好姑娘，只有十七岁，她不像别的那些女孩子和人随便乱搞——什么船长啦，或者大副啦，是的，她也绝没有被本地的男人碰过。她是很自爱的，你知道。[93]奥阿胡号船上的事务长在上次船停泊在这儿时跟我说，在各个群岛上，没有比爱塔更好的姑娘了。对她来说，也该安顿下来了，而且，那些船长们、大副们喜欢时不时地换一下口味，给我干活的女孩我从不让她们干太久。就在你来半岛前不久，爱塔在塔拉瓦奥河畔搞到一块土地，就是靠卖收获的椰干——现在价钱不错——你们也能过上蛮舒服的生活。那儿还有座房子，你不是一直都想有个地方画画吗，你觉得怎么样？’”

蒂亚瑞停下来，喘了口气，接下去说：

“就是在那个时候，他告诉我在英格兰他有个妻子。‘我可怜的斯特里克兰，’我对他说，‘他们在某处都有个妻子，那也是他们通常要来这些岛上的原因。爱塔是个聪明的姑娘，她不指望你在市长面前跟她举行结婚仪式，她是个新教教徒，你知道新教教徒不像天主教教徒把这些仪式看得那么重要。’”

“随后，他又说：‘但是爱塔觉得这事怎么样？’‘好像她对你很迷恋[94]哩，’我说，‘如果你愿意，她愿意嫁给你。用我叫她过来吗？’斯特里克兰很滑稽地咯咯笑了起来，就像他一贯干巴巴的笑，我把爱塔叫了过来，这个小野丫头，她知道我正在跟斯特里克兰说些什么，我用眼角的余光扫视着她，她假装在熨烫给我洗的一件罩衫，可耳朵一直在听着这边。她笑嘻嘻地走过来，但我还是能看出来她有点害羞，而斯特里克兰看着她，没有说话。”

“她好看吗？”我问道。

“还不错，但是你可能已经看过她的肖像了。他一遍又一遍地画她，有时她身上围着一件帕利欧[95]，有时一丝不挂。是的，她还是挺漂亮的，而且她会做饭，我亲手教她的厨艺。我看出斯特里克兰也想到了这点，所以我对他说：‘我给她的薪水不低，而且她把这些钱都存了起来，她认识的那些船长和大副们也时不时地给她一些小玩意儿，她已经存了好几百法郎了。’”

“他捋着那把大红胡子，笑了。”

“‘好吧，爱塔，’他说道，‘你愿意让我做你的丈夫吗？’”

“她一句话也没说，但就是咯咯地笑。”

“‘不过我告诉你，我可怜的斯特里克兰，这姑娘挺迷恋[96]你的。’”我说道。

“‘我会打你的。’”他看着这姑娘说道。

“‘如果你不打我，我怎么知道你爱我呢？’她回答道。”

蒂亚瑞中断叙述，对我又回忆起了她自己的故事。

“我的第一任丈夫，约翰逊船长，过去常常每隔一段时间就打我一次。他是个身高六英尺三英寸的英俊爷们，每当他喝醉了的时候，他自己都控制不了自己，有那么一段时间，好些天我全身上下都是青一块紫一块的。噢，可当他死去的时候，我还是哭得昏天黑地的。我想我这辈子也不会从这个打击中恢复过来了。但是，直到我嫁给了乔治·瑞尼以后，我才真正明白我失去了什么。除非你和某个男人一起过日子，你才能知道这个男人到底怎么样，我受到任何一个男人的欺骗，也没像乔治·瑞尼骗我的那样深。他也是个长相不错、身材挺拔的男人，他和约翰逊船长差不多高，看上去也足够强壮，但这些都是表面现象，他从不喝酒，从没动过我一根手指头，他就像个传教士，我和每一艘停泊在岛上的轮船的官员们谈情说爱，而乔治·瑞尼从不说什么。最后，我对他实在是烦透了，就跟他离了婚。像他那样的丈夫有什么好处？有些男人对待他们妻子的方式太可怕了。”

我安慰了蒂亚瑞一番，并满是同情地说道，男人们都是骗子，然后，让她接下去把斯特里克兰的故事讲完。

“‘好吧，’我对他说，‘这事也不必太匆忙，花点时间好好考虑考虑。爱塔在厢房有一间很不错的小屋，你可以和她先同居一个月，看看到底喜不喜欢她。你还可以在这儿吃饭。到了月末，如果你决定要娶她，就可以和她一起离开，到她那块土地上定居下来。’”

“嗯，后来他同意了我的建议。爱塔继续在我这儿清理房间，也正像我对他说的，我给他提供一日三餐，我教给爱塔做上一两道他喜欢的菜。他没有花很多时间去画画，大部分时间都是在山丘上游荡，还有在溪流中洗澡。有时坐在码头上眺望环礁湖。在日落时分，他会走到海边，遥望莫里阿岛。他常常还会在礁石上钓鱼，喜欢在港口那儿溜达，跟当地人聊天。他是个挺不错的家伙，很安静。每天晚饭后，他会和爱塔一起回到厢房。我看出来他心底渴望离开这儿回到丛林中去。于是到了月末的时候，我问他有什么打算。他说如果爱塔愿意走，他也愿意和她一起走。所以，那天晚上，我亲自下厨，给他们俩准备了婚礼晚宴，我给他们做了豌豆汤、葡萄牙风味的[97]大龙虾、咖喱饭和椰子沙拉——你还从来没尝过我做的椰子沙拉呢，是吧？在你走之前，我一定给你做一顿——后来，我还给他们做了冰激凌，我们大家都喝了香槟酒，然后又喝了甜酒。哦，我拿定主意要把婚礼办得像那么回事。后来我们在客厅里跳舞。我那时还不是太胖，我一直喜欢跳舞。”

鲜花旅馆的客厅并不大，有一架立式小钢琴，一套红木家具，上面覆盖着烙花丝绒罩子，沿着墙壁整整齐齐地摆了一溜儿。在圆桌上放了几本相册，在墙上挂着蒂亚瑞和她的第一任丈夫约翰逊船长的放大照片。尽管蒂亚瑞现在又老又胖，偶尔我们也会把布鲁塞尔地毯卷起来一起跳舞，伴奏的是一台留声机里发出的叽叽呀呀的音乐。在露台上，空气中弥漫着浓浓的野草花香，头顶上，是南十字星[98]在万里无云的夜空中闪烁。

蒂亚瑞回忆起那次过去很久的聚会脸上仍洋溢着开心的笑容。

“我们一直玩到凌晨三点，上床睡觉的时候，每个人都喝得迷迷糊糊的。我告诉他们可以坐我的小马车走，一直走到大路走不通的地方。因为接下来，他们有很长的一段路要徒步走。爱塔的土地就在大山的山坳里。他们天一亮就上路了，我派去送他们的伙计直到第二天才赶回来。”

“没错，斯特里克兰就这样把婚给结了。”





第五十二章


我想接下来的三年，是斯特里克兰生命中最幸福的时光。爱塔的房屋坐落在离塔希提岛环岛路八公里左右的地方，到达那儿，要走一条弯弯曲曲的小道，小道周围是郁郁葱葱的热带参天大树，遮天蔽日。房屋是一座平房，由原木搭建而成，没有做任何粉刷，有两个房间，房屋外有一个小凉棚，用作了厨房。屋里没有什么家具，地上铺着席子当床用，还有一把摇摇椅，放在了露台上。紧挨着房屋四周长满了芭蕉树，巨大的芭蕉叶斑驳残破，就像一个落难的女皇穿着破破烂烂的衣服。在房屋后面还有一棵梨树，结满了鳄梨，还有椰子树，结出的椰子给了这片土地资金来源。爱塔的父亲生前在土地的周围还种了一圈巴豆，它们长得茂盛异常，色彩斑斓，生机勃勃，像一团火焰把这片土地围了起来。一棵杧果树生长在房屋前，在屋前空地边缘有两棵姊妹树，开着火焰色红花，火红的花朵和椰子树上金黄的椰果争奇斗艳。

斯特里克兰就以这片土地上的产品为生，很少再到帕皮提去了。在住处不远，有一条小溪流，他常在里面洗澡。偶尔会从上游过来一群鱼，这个时候当地人会拿着长矛，聚集在溪流的旁边发出震耳叫喊，刺穿这些惊恐万状的鱼，这些鱼本来是要匆匆忙忙地游向大海的。有时斯特里克兰也去礁石上，回来时常带着一筐个头不大五颜六色的鱼。爱塔会用椰子油把这些小鱼煎了，或者配上一只大龙虾。有时，她还会做上一顿美味的螃蟹，这些大个的陆地蟹会在你的脚下急急忙忙地跑来跑去。在大山上，生长着很多野生的橘子树，爱塔时不时地会和两三个村里妇女搭伴上山，采摘很多绿色的、甜美多汁的野果子，满载而归。而后，椰子成熟了，到了采摘的时节，她的堂兄弟姐妹，或者表兄弟姐妹们（就像所有的当地人一样，爱塔有一大堆的亲戚）会爬到树上，把大个的、熟透的椰子扔下来。他们把这些椰子劈开，把它们放到太阳底下晒干。随后，他们把椰干取出放在袋子中。接下来，妇女们把这一袋袋椰干运到住在环礁湖附近村子的商人那里，他会把大米、肥皂和肉罐头，乃至一小笔钱换给这些妇女。有时，邻村有宴会的话，就会宰杀一头猪。然后人们就会去这个村子，大家大吃一顿，吃得都快吐了，接下来就是跳舞，唱赞美诗。

但是，斯特里克兰住的房子离村子很远。塔希提岛的人很懒散，他们喜欢旅行，喜欢拉家长里短，可他们不爱走路，所以可能有好几周，斯特里克兰和爱塔两人都是独自待着。他作画，阅读，傍晚天黑下来的时候，他们俩一起坐在露台上，边抽着烟，边欣赏夜景。后来，爱塔怀了孩子，一个老妇人过来帮她接生，帮爱塔生完孩子后老太太就留了下来。不久，这个老妇人的孙女也过来跟她待在一起，再后来，一个年轻人也来了——没人知道他从哪儿来，跟哪个人有关系——但是他无忧无虑地安顿了下来，和他们住在了一起。





第五十三章


一天正当我把蒂亚瑞告诉我的有关斯特里克兰的事情往一块儿拢的时候，我听见她喊道：“你瞧，那就是布鲁诺船长。[99]”她接着说，“他对斯特里克兰很了解，他还去过他们家呢。”

我看见一个中年法国男人，留着一把大黑胡须，一些已经变得花白，脸膛被太阳晒得黢黑，一双大眼睛炯炯有神。他身上穿着一套整洁的帆布衣服。其实在午餐时，我就留意他了，一个名叫阿林的中国侍者告诉我，他是当天乘从包莫图斯来的船上岸的。蒂亚瑞把我介绍给了他，他递给我一张名片。名片很大，上面印着“勒内·布鲁诺[100]”，名字下面印着“外贸号船长[101]”。我和蒂亚瑞当时坐在厨房外面的小露台上，蒂亚瑞正为一个打扫房间的女孩裁剪衣服。他过来和我们坐在了一起。

“是的，我和斯特里克兰挺熟。”他说，“我很喜欢下棋，他也一直很喜欢这个游戏。我因为生意的缘故一年要来塔希提岛三四次，如果他也在帕皮提的话，就会过来和我下上几盘。他后来结婚了。”——说到这里，布鲁诺船长笑了起来，耸了耸肩膀——“最后[102]，他和那个蒂亚瑞介绍给他的姑娘住在了一起，他还邀请我去看他，我是那场婚礼晚宴的客人之一。”他看了一眼蒂亚瑞，两个人都放声大笑起来。“结婚以后，斯特里克兰就不怎么常去帕皮提了，大约一年以后，我碰巧不得不去岛上他住的那一带办事，具体是什么事我忘了。我办完事后，对自己说：‘哎，我干吗不去看看可怜的斯特里克兰呢？’我问了一两个当地人是否认识他，才发现他竟然住在离我这儿不超过五公里的地方，所以我就去了。我永远不会忘记那次拜访留给我的印象。我住在一个环状珊瑚岛上，在岛的低地部分，带状的陆地被一个环礁湖所围绕。这个岛的美丽之处在于海洋和天空，还有环礁湖水不同的颜色，以及椰子树林的优雅；但是斯特里克兰住的地方有种伊甸园的美，啊，我真希望你能看到那个地方摄人心魄的美，一处远离尘嚣的幽静之所，头顶蓝天，四周是种类繁多、郁郁葱葱的大树。那里是色彩的盛宴，香味弥漫，凉风习习，任何词语都无法描绘出这个人间仙境。他住在这里，忘却了这个世界，也被这个世界所忘却。我料想在一个欧洲人的眼中，那个地方土得掉渣，脏得要命，房屋破破烂烂，一点儿也不干净。当我走近时，看见三四个当地人正躺在露台上，你知道当地人喜欢在一起扎堆，有一个年轻男人四仰八叉地躺在那里抽烟，他身上除了一件帕利欧什么也没穿。”

所谓帕利欧就是一长条棉布，红色或者蓝色，上面印着白色的图案，它围在腰间，悬挂到膝盖上。

“一个女孩，可能有十五岁左右吧，正在用露兜树叶编织一顶草帽，一个老太太正盘着腿抽一杆烟袋。后来我又看见了爱塔，她正在给一个新生儿喂奶，另一个孩子光溜溜地在她脚旁玩耍。当她看见我的时候，就招呼斯特里克兰出来。他应声向门口走来，也是除了帕利欧什么都没穿。他的样子与众不同，红胡子，头发乱蓬蓬的，胸毛很浓密。他的脚磨出了厚茧，伤痕累累，所以我知道他总是光着脚走路。他变得比当地人还像当地人。看上去他见到我很高兴，告诉爱塔杀只鸡来款待我。然后他把我领进屋，给我看进门时他正在创作的一幅画。在屋的一角有一张床，中间是一个画架，上面挂着画布。因为我可怜他，所以我曾花过一小笔钱买过他的一些画，后来我把其中的一些画送给了我在法国的朋友们。虽说我当初买这些画是出于同情，但是随着在生活中对这些画的耳闻目染，我开始喜欢上了它们。的确，我发现了这些画中所蕴含的奇特的美。那时大家都认为我疯了，可事实证明我是对的，我是岛上第一个能欣赏他绘画的人。”

他幸灾乐祸地冲着蒂亚瑞笑了笑，惹得她又懊悔不已地把老故事跟我们重复了一遍：在拍卖时，她怎样根本没理睬斯特里克兰遗物中的那些画，却花二十七法郎买了一个美国造的炉子。

“你现在还有这些画吗？”我问布鲁诺船长。

“是的，我打算一直留着它们，直到我女儿到了出嫁的年龄，我再把它们卖了，把卖画的钱给女儿做嫁妆。”

然后，他又继续跟我们讲述他对斯特里克兰的那次拜访。

“我绝对忘不了我和他一起度过的那个晚上。我原本打算在他那儿只待一个小时的，可他坚持留我过夜。我犹豫了一会儿，说实在话，我不是太喜欢那些垫子的模样，他建议我就睡在它们上面。但我耸了耸肩膀，还是留了下来。当时我正在修建在包莫图斯岛上的房屋，我已经在比垫子更硬的木板床上睡了好几个星期，除了灌木丛，没有什么可遮风避雨的。至于那些蚊虫小咬，我粗糙的皮肤足以阻挡它们的恶意骚扰。”

“当爱塔准备晚饭的时候，我们下到溪流中去洗澡。吃完晚饭，我们坐到露台上，一边抽烟，一边聊天。那个年轻的男人拉着手风琴，他演奏的都是十几年前音乐厅里流行的曲调，在远离文明数千英里的热带小岛上，这些曲调听上去怪怪的。我问斯特里克兰和这些混杂的人住在一起是否会让他觉得困扰。没有，他说道，他可喜欢唾手可得的这些模特啦。过了一会儿，在一阵阵大声的哈欠连天后，那些当地人都离开去睡觉了，就剩下斯特里克兰和我单独待着。我无法向你描述那里夜晚的宁静有多么深沉，在包莫图斯我住的那个岛上，从来没有像那里的夜晚那么全然的寂静，在我住的岛上，夜晚会听见海岸上各种各样动物窸窸窣窣的动静，所有的小贝壳类动物也到处爬，一点儿也不消停，还有那爱闹动静的陆地蟹东奔西跑。在环礁湖中，时不时能听见鱼儿跃起的声音，有时还能听见一阵水花四溅的声音，好像一条棕色的鲨鱼把所有的鱼儿惊得四下逃散。而最重要的是，就像时间永不停息一样，是浪花一遍又一遍拍打礁石的喧嚣声。然而，在斯特里克兰住的地方没有一点儿声音，空气中飘散着夜晚开放的白色花朵的香味。夜晚是如此的美妙，以至于你的灵魂似乎都不能忍受肉体的禁锢了，你觉得它已经做好了在空灵虚幻的空气中飘荡而去的准备，进而死神也成了你的至爱亲朋。”

蒂亚瑞叹了一口气。

“啊，我真希望我能再回到十五岁的年纪。”

这时，她看见一只猫正企图偷吃厨房餐桌上放着的一盘对虾，伴随着敏捷的手势和一连串的破口大骂，一本书飞向了那只猫，正砸在它逃窜的尾巴上。

“我问他和爱塔在一起是否幸福。”

“‘她从不干涉我，’他说，‘她给我准备一日三餐，照看小孩子，我说什么她都照做，她给了我能从一个女人那儿得到的一切。’”

“‘你就从来没对离开欧洲感到后悔吗？有时你会不会怀念巴黎或者伦敦街上的灯光，怀念你朝夕相处的朋友和伙伴？还有一些我不知道的东西[103]，比如剧院和报纸之类，还有小公共汽车轧在鹅卵石铺就的街道上的隆隆声，这些你都怀念过吗？’”

他沉默了好长时间，然后他说道：

“‘我会待在这儿，直到我死去。’”

“‘但是你从没感到过烦闷或者孤独吗？’”我问道。

“他咯咯笑了起来。”

“‘我可怜的朋友[104]，’他说道，‘很显然你不知道作为一名艺术家意味着什么。’”

布鲁诺船长转向我，温和地一笑，在他黑黑的、善良的眼睛里闪烁着奇特的光辉。

“他这么说，对我可不公正，因为我也知道怀揣梦想是怎么回事。我也有我的幻想。在我的方式上，我也是一名艺术家。”

我们又都沉默了一会儿，蒂亚瑞从她那宽大的口袋里摸出了一大把香烟，她递给我们每人一支。我们三个人都抽上了烟。最后，她开口说道：

“既然这位先生[105]对斯特里克兰感兴趣，为什么你不领他去见见库特拉斯医生呢？这位医生能给他讲讲有关斯特里克兰生病和去世的一些情况。”

“乐意之至。[106]”船长看着我说道。

我谢了他。他看了看手表。

“六点半了，如果你不介意现在就走的话，我们可以在家里找到他。”

我马上站起身来，我们沿着通往医生家的路走去。他住在城镇外面，而鲜花旅馆也在城镇的边缘了，所以我们很快就到了乡下。宽宽的路两旁长满了茂密的花椒树，路两边还有很多种植园，种满了椰子树和香子兰。海盗鸟在棕榈树的叶子间发出尖叫声。我们路过一座石桥，桥下是浅浅的河水，我们停留了几分钟，看着当地的小孩们在河里嬉戏。他们争相追逐，边尖叫，边欢笑，而棕色的身体湿漉漉的，在阳光下一闪一闪。





第五十四章


当我们一路走去的时候，我思索着斯特里克兰的状况。最近我听说了不少有关他的情况，但最让我关注的还是这个环境。在这里，这个遥远的岛屿上，他似乎不会引起人们的丝毫厌恶，相反还会赢得同情，这与在他家乡的情景迥然不同。他的奇行怪癖能够被容忍，被接受。对于这里的人们——无论当地人还是欧洲人，他是个怪人，但是他们对于种种怪人都习以为常了，所以对他也就见怪不怪了。这个世界上本来充满了怪人，这些人常有非常之举，也许这里的人能够理解，一个人不是他自己想成为那样的人，而是他必须是那样的人。在英格兰和法国，他好比是方楔子被敲进了圆窟窿，总是与大众格格不入，而在这里，有着各种形状的窟窿，任何形状的楔子都能找到合适的窟窿。我并不认为他在这儿脾气就变得温和了，就不那么自私或者残忍了，我只能说这儿的环境更加适宜他了。如果他最初就在这样的环境中度过一生的话，他在别人眼中也不会是那么糟糕的人，他在这儿收到了在他自己人那里既没有指望，也绝不会想到的东西——那就是同情。

我试图告诉布鲁诺船长，我心中充满了某种让我吃惊的东西。他一时半刻并没有回答我。

“这一点儿也不奇怪，不管怎么样，我都应该对他有着同情，”他最后说道，“因为，虽然可能我们俩都不知道具体是什么东西，但我们的目标是同样的。”

“这到底是什么东西呀，像你和斯特里克兰是截然不同的两个人，竟然会目标一致？”我笑着问道。

“美。”

“太高深了。”我嘀咕了一句。

“你知道陷入爱情之中的人是什么样的吗？他们除了爱情，对世界上的其他任何事情都视而不见，充耳不闻。他们不再是自己的主人，而是像在大帆船的木凳上被锁住的奴隶，在身不由己地划着船。牢牢捆绑住斯特里克兰的激情，就像专断的爱情一样，而且还有过之而无不及。”

“听你这么说，多奇怪呀！”我回答道，“因为老早以前，我认为他是被魔鬼附身了呢。”

“斯特里克兰内心的激情正是一种创造美的激情，让他不得安生。它催促他不得不东奔西走。他就像一个永恒的朝圣者，魂牵梦萦的是那一块圣地，而心中盘踞的魔鬼又是那么无情。有那么一些人，他们追求真理的欲望是如此强烈，以至于为了获得真理，他们不惜把他们世界的基础掀得天翻地覆。斯特里克兰就是这样的人，只不过在他那里，美取代了真理的位置，我对他唯一的感觉就是深深的同情。”

“这听上去也挺奇怪。一个曾被斯特里克兰深深伤害过的人也跟我说过，他对斯特里克兰有着很多同情。”我沉默了一会儿，“我很想知道你是否已经找到了对一个人的解释，而这个人对我来说，似乎一直也无法解释。你是怎么想到这些道理的？”

他笑着转向我说：

“我没告诉过你，以我的方式，我也是个艺术家吗？我自己认识到，同我一样的欲望也在他心中涌动，但是他的媒介是绘画，而我的媒介是生活。”

后来布鲁诺船长又给我讲了一个故事，这个故事在此我要重述一遍。因为哪怕就是从对比的角度出发，它也会为我对斯特里克兰的印象中增添些东西。在我看来，这个故事本身也有美的内涵。

布鲁诺船长是布列塔尼人，曾经在法国海军里当过兵。他结婚以后就离开了军队，定居在靠近坎佩尔的一栋不大的房产中，打算就这样平平安安地度过余生。但是替他打理一切投资的代理人生意失败，突然之间，他发现自己已经身无分文。他和他妻子都不愿在本来还享有一定身份地位的地方，过一种赤贫的生活。当他在海上当兵时，他曾坐着军舰巡游过南太平洋，于是他决定去那里碰碰运气。他花了好几个月的时间在帕皮提实施计划和积累经验，再后来，他从在法国的一位朋友那里借了一笔钱，他在包莫图斯群岛中买了一个岛屿，岛上有一片环形的陆地，在陆地中间是一个很深的环礁湖。岛上没有人住，只覆盖着灌木丛和野生番石榴[107]，带着一个大无畏的女人——他的妻子，还有几个当地人，踏上了这块土地，开始修建房屋，清理灌木丛，以便种上椰子树。二十年光阴荏苒，现在那个荒芜的小岛已经变成了小花园。

“一开始，那是一项艰巨而又令人担忧的工程，我们两个人都拼死拼活地工作。每天天一亮我就起床了，清除灌木，种植作物，修缮房屋，到了晚上，我一倒在床上，就像一条死狗一样一觉睡到早晨。我妻子工作得跟我一样辛苦。后来，我们又有了孩子，第一胎是个儿子，接下来又生了个女儿。我和我妻子把我们所知道的全部知识都教给他们。我们有一架钢琴，是从法国托运过来的。她教他们弹钢琴和说英语，而我教他们拉丁文和数学，我们一块儿读历史书。孩子们能划小船，像当地人一样游泳很棒，对岛上的一切都了然于心。我们种下的各种树木蓬勃生长，在礁石上养殖的贝类繁衍得也很快。我这次到塔希提岛来是为了买一艘纵帆船。用这艘船我能捞到足够多的蚌类，说不准能把买船的钱赚回来，谁知道呢？我可能捞到一些珍珠呢。我已经白手起家了。我也创造了美。啊，你不了解，当看到这些高大挺拔的大树，想想它们每一棵都是我亲手种下的，那是一种什么样的心情。”

“我问一个你曾经问过斯特里克兰的同样问题：你一点儿也不后悔离开法国，一点儿也不怀念你布列塔尼的老家吗？”

“有那么一天，当我的女儿嫁了人，我的儿子娶了妻，能够取代我在岛上的位置的时候，我和老伴会回到故土，在我出生的老屋中度过我们最后的岁月。”

“你那时再回首过去，会感到生活很幸福。”我说道。

“那是肯定的[108]，在我那个小岛上，日子过得很平淡，我们和外界相隔遥远——试想一下，要来到塔希提岛，我得在海上航行四天——但是在那里我们非常开心。只有少数人能够尝试一种工作，还能取得非凡成就。我们的生活简单和淳朴。我们不会受到野心的撺掇，如果说我们也有自豪的话，那就是仅仅靠我们的双手，我们就能有这么多的成果。我们既不会有恶意的困扰，也不会有嫉妒的抨击。啊，我亲爱的先生[109]，也许有人认为‘劳动带来幸福’是句毫无意义的空话，但对我来说，这句话有着最为重大的含义，因为我就是这样一个幸福的人。”

“我敢肯定，这句话对你恰如其分，你理应得到幸福。”我笑着说。

“我希望自己也能这么想。我不知道自己积了什么德，得到了这样一位好妻子，她是我绝佳的朋友和帮手，绝妙的爱人，也是孩子们的完美母亲。”

船长的这一番话，在我的头脑中浮现了一种新的人生观，我思索了好一会儿。

“很显然，在那种生活条件下，你们还取得了成功，你们夫妇俩一定有强烈的意愿和坚强的意志。”

“可能是这样吧，但是如果没有另外一种因素，我们也可能一事无成。”

“那是什么因素？”

他停下了脚步，带有某种戏剧色彩地张开了双臂。

“相信上帝，没有这个信仰我们早就迷失了。”

说话间，我们来到库特拉斯医生家门前。





第五十五章


库特拉斯医生是位法国老先生，身材高大，体型肥硕，他身体的形状就像一个巨大的鸭蛋。一对蓝色的敏锐的眼睛充满善意，目光时不时志得意满地落在便便大腹上。他的脸膛红彤彤的，头发全白，他是一个第一眼就能让人萌生好感的人。他在一间屋子里接待了我们，这间屋子要是放在法国偏僻小镇上，可能有一栋房子那么大，屋里的一两件波斯小摆件看上去怪怪的。他用双手握住了我的一只手——他的双手很大——很热情地打量了我一番，然而在目光中透出了精明。当他和布鲁诺船长握手的时候，他礼貌地问候了船长的妻子和孩子们[110]。有好几分钟的时间，大家都在寒暄客套，又聊了一些岛上的家长里短，以及今年椰子和香草果的收成等，接下来我们提起了这次拜访的正题。

我现在无法把库特拉斯医生的原话一字一句地复述出来，只能用我自己的话表述了，因为他的讲述绘声绘色，经我一转述，反而失去了趣味，这是一种遗憾。他的嗓音低沉而洪亮、富有磁性，和他庞大的身躯倒也匹配，语气语调活灵活现，很有戏剧效果。听他的讲述，就像成语所说，惟妙惟肖，甚至比看一场好看的戏剧还要精彩得多。

事情的经过大概是这样的。库特拉斯医生有一天去塔拉瓦奥看一个生病的老女酋长。他把这个胖老太太描述得绘声绘色。她躺在一张巨大的床上，抽着香烟，身边围着一群黑皮肤的侍从。给她看完病后，他被领进另一间屋子，招待他吃饭——生鱼片、煎香蕉、小鸡，还有一些他搞不清的东西[111]，是典型的土生土长当地人[112]的饭菜。当他正在吃饭的时候，看见一个年轻的小姑娘眼泪汪汪地被人从门口赶开了。当时他也没在意，但等他出了门，登上马车准备回家的时候，又看见了她，就站在不远的地方。她用一种愁眉苦脸的神情望着他，而且泪水像小溪似的从脸颊滑落。他问旁边的人她怎么回事。有人告诉他，这姑娘从山上下来的，想请他去给一个生了病的白人看病。他们已经告诉她不能打扰医生。他把她叫过来，亲自问她想干什么。她告诉他，是爱塔派她来的，爱塔以前在鲜花旅馆干过，说“红胡子”病了。她塞给他一张皱巴巴的报纸，当他打开报纸，发现里面夹着一张一百法郎的钞票。

“‘红胡子’是谁呀？”他问一个路边站着的人。

那人告诉他，他们这样叫一个英国人，是个画家，他和爱塔住在离这里大约七公里的山谷里。从这些人的描述中，他知道了“红胡子”就是斯特里克兰。但是去那里只能步行，所以他不可能说去就去，这也是为什么他们要把这小姑娘赶走的原因。

“坦白地说，”医生转向我说道，“我当时很犹豫。我可不愿意在一条很难走的羊肠小道上，去品味颠簸来回十四公里的味道，而且当天晚上我是不可能赶回帕皮提了。再加上我对斯特里克兰也没有什么好感。他是一个闲散、没用的恶棍，宁愿和一个当地的女人同居，也不像我们这些人那样靠工作为生。我的上帝呀[113]，我怎么知道有一天整个世界得出了他是个天才的结论呢？我问小姑娘他是否病得很重，为什么不能到镇子上找我来看病。我还问她到底他是怎样的病情。她不回答，我又追问她，也许口吻显得很生气，但她只是眼睛盯着地面，又开始哭了起来。然后我只好耸了耸肩。不管怎么说，也许出于医生的职责，我只能跑一趟了，我很不高兴地吩咐她在前面带路。”

当他到达的时候，情绪很明显变得更糟。他走得满身大汗，又累又渴。爱塔正在等着他来，沿着小道走出一小段路迎接他。

“在我给任何病人看病之前，先去给我拿点喝的，否则我都渴死了。”他大声喊道，“看在上帝的分上[114]，给我拿个椰子来。”

爱塔喊了一声，一个男孩跑了出来，他三下两下就爬到了树上，很快扔下一个熟透的椰子。爱塔在上面开了个洞，医生痛痛快快地吸了一气椰子水。随后他给自己卷了根香烟，觉得心情好多了。

“好了，告诉我‘红胡子’在哪儿吧？”他问道。

“他在屋里，正在画画呢。我没告诉他你要来。进去吧，去看看他。”

“但是，他说过哪儿不舒服吗？如果他身体好得还能画画，他的身体就应该足够支撑他去塔拉瓦奥找我看病，省得我跑了这该死的一路。该不是觉得我的时间没他的时间值钱吧？”

爱塔没有吭声，但和男孩一起跟着他走向了屋子。带他来的那个小女孩此时正坐在露台上，这儿还躺着一个老太太，背对着墙，正在卷当地人吸的纸烟。爱塔指了指门，医生有点恼火，也好奇为什么他们的行为那么古怪。进了屋门，医生发现斯特里克兰正在清洗调色板，在画架上还有一幅画。斯特里克兰只穿着帕利欧，正背对着门站着，听到靴子的响声后，他转过身来，满脸愠色地对着医生。他看见医生很吃惊，对有人闯入有点生气。然而，医生倒吸了一口凉气，双脚像钉子一样钉在了地板上。他惊得目瞪口呆，这是他完全没有意料到的，全身被恐惧所笼罩。

“你没敲门就进来了，”斯特里克兰说，“有什么我能为你效劳的吗？”

医生回了回神，但是费了很大力气才能开口说话，他的所有不快都烟消云散了，他感到——哦，对，我不能否认[115]——他觉得心中涌出了无限怜悯。

“我是库特拉斯医生，我在塔拉瓦奥给女酋长看病，爱塔派人找到了我，让我来给你看看病。”

“她这个人他妈的是个傻瓜。我就是最近有点疼痛，也有点发烧，但是没什么大不了的，很快就过去了。下次有人再去帕皮提的话，我打算让人给我捎点奎宁来。”

“你还是自己照照镜子吧。”

斯特里克兰笑着瞟了他一眼，走到挂在墙上的镜子前。镜子很廉价，用一个小木框镶嵌着。

“怎么了？”

“你没看见你脸上奇怪的变化吗？你没看见你的五官都肿胀了起来，这副模样——叫我怎么描述它呢？——书上叫它‘狮子脸’。我可怜的朋友[116]，难道一定要我给你指出来，你患上了一种可怕的疾病吗？”

“我吗？”

“当你在镜子里看你自己时，你看到的是典型的麻风病人的外表。”

“你是在开玩笑。”斯特里克兰说道。

“我也希望是在开玩笑。”

“你是打算告诉我，我患上了麻风病吗？”

“很不幸，这已经是不容置疑的事了。”

库特拉斯医生给很多病人宣判过死刑，可每次这样做时他都无法克服心中充满的恐惧。他觉得这些被判了死刑的病人会把自己和医生相比较，想到医生身心健康，对生活享有无法估量的特权，他们一定总是会又气又恨。斯特里克兰一言不发地看着他，在他脸上看不出任何感情的变化，但这张脸已经被可恶的疾病折磨得变了形。

“他们知道吗？”他最后问道，指了指在露台上的那些人，现在这些人坐在那里，一反往日的热闹，出现了非同寻常的、难以理解的沉默。

“这些当地人对这个病的症状都很了解，”医生说道，“他们害怕告诉你。”

斯特里克兰向门口走去，并向外张望。在他脸上一定有某种可怕的东西，因为突然之间，他们都放声大哭，如丧考妣，而且声音越来越高，哀号声不断。斯特里克兰没有说话，看了他们一会儿，又重新走回屋里。

“你认为我还能活多久？”

“谁知道呢？有时这种病能存活二十年。如果早一些死，反而是上帝发了慈悲呢。”

斯特里克兰走到画架前，若有所思地看着伫立在那儿的那幅画。

“你走了很长的一段路才来到这里。带来重要消息的人应该得到回报，这是恰如其分的。把这幅画拿走吧，现在它对你来说什么都不是，但是可能有那么一天，你会很高兴能够拥有它。”

库特拉斯医生推辞说，他来这儿不需要报酬，他已经把那一百法郎退还给了爱塔，但是斯特里克兰坚持让他收下这幅画。随后，他们俩一起出门来到露台。那些当地人的抽泣声更加厉害了。

“安静，女人，擦干你的眼泪，”斯特里克兰对着爱塔说，“没有什么大不了的，我很快就会离开你了。”

“他们不会把你弄走吧？”她喊道。

那个时候，在群岛上对麻风病病人还没有严格的隔离措施，如果病人自己愿意，他们可以自由活动。

“我将要到大山里面去。”斯特里克兰说道。

爱塔站起身，脸冲着他。

“如果别人选择离开，让他们走好了，可是我不会离开你的，你是我的男人，我是你的女人，如果你离开了我，我会吊死在屋后的那个大树上。我对上帝发誓，我说到做到。”

她说这话的时候，语气中有种不屈不挠的倔强劲儿。她已经不再是那个驯服、软弱的土著小姑娘了，而是一个意志坚定的女人，已经发生了脱胎换骨的变化。

“为什么你要跟我待在一起呢？你可以回到帕皮提去，很快你就能找到另一个白人做丈夫。家里的这个老太太可以照料孩子们，而且蒂亚瑞看到你回去会很高兴的。”

“你是我的男人，我是你的女人。无论你去哪儿，我都跟着你。”

片刻之间，斯特里克兰的铁石心肠被动摇和软化了，眼睛里噙着泪，慢慢地顺着脸颊流了下来。过了一会儿，他又露出了他惯有的那种讥讽的微笑。

“女人真是奇怪的动物。”他对库特斯拉医生说道，“你可以像狗一样对待她们，你可以鞭打她们直到你的胳膊变酸，但她们仍然爱着你。”他耸了耸肩膀，“当然了，基督教认为她们也是有灵魂的，这真是荒唐透顶的异想天开。”

“你在跟医生说些什么呢？”爱塔疑虑重重地问道，“你不会离开吧？”

“如果你不愿意让我走，我就留下吧，可怜的孩子。”

爱塔一下子在他面前跪倒了，用双臂环抱着他的双腿，亲吻着它们。斯特里克兰看着库特拉斯医生，微微笑了一下。

“到了最后，她们还是会抓住你，在她们的手掌心中你是无力挣脱的。无论是白皮肤还是棕色皮肤的女人，她们全都一个样。”

库特拉斯医生觉得，在这场可怕的灾难面前，说些表示遗憾的话反而是荒唐的，于是他打算告辞了。斯特里克兰把塔内，那个摘椰子的男孩叫过来，让他给医生带路送回村里。库特拉斯医生停顿了一会儿，然后好像自言自语似的对我说道：

“我不喜欢他，我已经告诉过你，我对他没有什么好感。但是当我慢慢走在回塔拉瓦奥的路上，也不由得对他坚忍的勇气产生了钦佩之情。面对着也许是人类最可怕的疾病，他还能保持镇定和勇敢。当塔内跟我分手时，我告诉他，我会派人送些药过去，可能多少会有些用场。但是我不指望斯特里克兰会高兴服用这些药，当然，更不奢望他服用后病情能有好转。我还让小男孩给爱塔捎个了信，无论什么时候她派人来找我，我都会去的。生活是艰辛的，造化有时竟以折磨自己的儿女取乐。带着一种沉重的心情，我驾车回到了我在帕皮提温暖舒适的家。”

有很长一段时间，我们谁都没有说话。

“但是爱塔后来并没有派人来找过我，”终于医生又继续开口说了下去，“也碰巧我有很久没有再去岛的那个地区了，所以也没有斯特里克兰的消息。有那么一两次我听说爱塔为了买一些画画的材料来帕皮提，但是我都没有碰到过她。我再次去塔拉瓦奥之前，已经有两年多的时间过去了，我又一次给那位上了年纪的女酋长看过病后，我问他们是否听说了斯特里克兰的任何消息。这个时候，他得麻风病的消息已经传遍了各处。起初，是那个小男孩塔内离开那所房子，后来又过了一小段时间，那个老太太和她的孙女也离开了。那里就剩下斯特里克兰和爱塔，以及他们的孩子了。没人敢靠近他们的种植园。因为，正如你所知，当地人对这种病有种真切的恐惧，而且，要是在过去，只要发现有人得了这种病，病人都会被杀死。但有时，村里的男孩子们爬上小山丘的时候，会看见那个满脸大红胡子的白人也在山丘上溜达。孩子们会吓得四下逃散。有时，爱塔会趁着夜色来到村子里，敲开杂货店的门，购买各种她急需的东西。她清楚当地村民看待她就像看待斯特里克兰一样充满可怕的厌恶，所以爱塔都躲着他们走。有一次，有几个女人壮起胆子走到比平常更靠近种植园的地方，正瞅见她在小溪中洗衣服，她们向她扔石头。从那以后，村民们让开杂货店的人给爱塔捎口信：如果她再用那条小溪的话，村里的男人们会去把她的房屋烧掉。”

“这些畜生。”我说道。

“别这么说，我亲爱的先生[117]，人都一样。恐惧使他们变得残忍……我决定去看看斯特里克兰，当我给女酋长看完病后，我让一个男孩给我指了路，但没人肯陪我一道去，我只好一个人硬着头皮摸索前行了。”

当库特拉斯医生到达种植园的时候，一种不安的情绪笼罩在心头。虽然走路走得很热，但不禁打了个寒战。在空气中有种充满敌意的东西，让他迟疑着裹足不前，而且他觉得看不见的力量正挡在路中间，无形的手似乎正在把他往回拽。现在没人敢靠近来捡拾椰子，所以椰子已经在地上腐烂了，每一处都是荒凉破败的景象。灌木丛正在蚕食着平整出来的土地，看上去好像原始森林很快就会重新占领这块土地，而这块土地肯定是以前费了九牛二虎之力才开垦出来的。他隐隐约约感觉到，这里就是痛苦的居留地。当他接近这所房屋时，他被一阵超凡脱俗的沉寂所震慑。起初他以为房子已经被废弃了，可紧接着他看见了爱塔。她正盘腿坐在倾斜的、作为厨房用的小棚子里，眼睛盯着锅里煮着的一大堆东西，在她身旁，一个小男孩正在泥土中静静地玩着。当她看见医生时，并未露出微笑。

“我来看看斯特里克兰。”他说道。

“我去告诉他一声。”

她走向房屋，上了几层通向露台的台阶，然后进了屋里。库特拉斯医生跟着她，但是在屋外面等她的手势招呼再进屋里。当她开门的时候，他闻见了一股腥甜气味，在麻风病人居住的地区总是有这种令人作呕的气味。他听见她在说话，紧接着又听到了斯特里克兰的回答，但是他都快认不出这个声音了，它变得沙哑和模糊不清。库特拉斯医生扬了一下眉毛，他判断疾病已经侵袭到了病人的声带。随后，爱塔出来了。

“他不想见你，你只好走了。”

库特拉斯医生坚持要见一下斯特里克兰，但她不让他进屋。库特拉斯医生耸了耸肩，考虑了一会儿，就转身走开了。她跟他一道走了出来，他觉得爱塔也想让他赶紧离开。

“难道压根就没有什么需要我帮忙的吗？”他问道。

“你可以给他送一些颜料来，”她说，“别的他就不需要什么了。”

“他还能画画呀？”

“他正在屋里的墙壁上画画呢。”

“对你来说，生活太可怕了，我可怜的孩子。”

这时，她终于露出了笑容，在她的眼睛里有一种超越了人类之爱的光辉。库特拉斯医生开始被它吓了一跳，后来很吃惊，进而又产生了敬畏之情。他发现自己说不出话来。

“他是我男人。”她说道。

“你另一个孩子在哪儿？”他问道，“我上次来这儿的时候，你有两个孩子的。”

“是的。另一个孩子死了，我们把孩子埋葬在那棵杧果树下面了。”

爱塔陪他走了一小段路，她说她必须回去了。库特拉斯医生明白她是怕走得太远，万一碰上从村里出来的人就麻烦了。他又一次告诉她，如果她需要他，只需派人送个口信，他立刻就会来的。





第五十六章


两年多的时间过去了，或者是三年，在塔希提岛时间不知不觉就过去了，要把时间算得准确是件困难的事。但是库特拉斯医生最终得到一个别人捎来的信息：斯特里克兰快要死了。爱塔在路上拦了一辆往帕皮提送邮件的马车，请求赶车的人立即去趟医生那儿，告诉他这个消息。但是当消息送达的时候，医生出门了。直到晚上，他才收到这个消息。因为太晚了，已经不可能启程出发，所以等到第二天天刚破晓，医生才动身。他先赶到塔拉瓦奥，然后最后一次徒步走七公里，踏上通往爱塔家的小路。路两边的野草疯长，把小路都快遮住了，很明显有不少年头这条小径都没人走过，找到路都不太容易了。有时，他不得不沿着小溪的岸边深一脚浅一脚地走；有时，他又不得不拨开茂密、长满荆棘的灌木丛艰难前行。好几次他不得不爬过岩石，为了躲开悬挂在他头顶树上的马蜂窝。周围万籁俱寂。

最后，他到了原木原色建成的小屋前，才如释重负地叹了口气。小屋现在显得更加的破旧，而且还脏兮兮的；但是这儿也有着相同的、让人无法忍受的沉寂。他向露台走去，看到一个小男孩在阳光底下无忧无虑地玩耍着，一看见他走近便飞快地跑掉了，对这个孩子来说，陌生人就像敌人一样。库特拉斯医生有着某种感觉，这个孩子正在一棵大树后面打量他。屋门大开着。他喊了一声，但没人应答。他走上前，又在门上敲了几下，还是没人应声。他转动门把手，径直走了进去。一阵恶臭扑面而来，让他快吐了出来。他把手绢捂到鼻子上，硬着头皮继续往前走去。屋里的光线很暗，刚从阳光灿烂的地方进来，有那么一会儿，他什么也看不见。当他的眼睛慢慢适应了屋里的光线的时候，他吓了一跳。他都有点搞不清楚身在何处了，好像突然进入了一个魔幻世界，恍惚间他好像看到了一大片原始森林，还有赤身露体的人们在树下行走。随后，他看出来了，这些原来都是在墙上画的画。

“我的上帝[118]，但愿太阳没把我晒昏。”他小声咕哝道。

有人稍微动了一下，吸引了他的注意力，他看见爱塔正躺在地板上，无声地抽泣着。

“爱塔，”他叫道，“爱塔。”

她没搭理，恶臭再一次差点把他熏晕过去，他赶忙点上了一支方头雪茄。这时，眼睛慢慢适应了黑暗，而当他盯着满是绘画的墙壁时，心中的情感像潮水般汹涌而来，虽然他完全不懂绘画，但是这些画中有某种与众不同的东西深深地感染着他。从地板到屋顶，所有墙壁上都画满了奇怪的、精心构思的画作，这些画有着用语言无法描述的壮观与神秘。库特拉斯医生觉得呼吸急促，喘不上气，内心充满他无法理解或者无从分析的感情，他感觉到敬畏和欣喜，就像一个人在混沌初开睁眼看世界的感觉。那画的气势磅礴，充满肉欲，又激情无限；然而，它又含着某种令人恐惧的东西，让人心惊肉跳。它是一个人的杰作，这个人已经钻研到大自然最隐秘的深处，洞悉了大自然既美丽又让人恐惧的秘密；它是一个人的杰作，这个人知道了一般人所不了解的邪恶的东西。画里还透着原始和可怕的东西，是不属于这个尘世凡间的。他的脑海中浮现出了模模糊糊的黑色魔法世界，既是美丽的，也是下流的。

“我的上帝[119]，这是天才呀。”

这句话道出了实情，但当时他自己都不知道自己说了什么。

随后，他的目光落到角落中垫子铺就的床上，他走了过去，看到了一个可怕的、残缺不全的、阴森的东西，那正是斯特里克兰。他已经死了。库特拉斯医生用了极大的意志力，俯身去观察这具死去多时、令人恐惧的尸体。突然他被吓得毛骨悚然，恐惧攫住了心脏，因为他分明感觉到身后有人。那人是爱塔，他根本没听见她走过来，她就站在他旁边，正在看他所观察的尸体。

“我的老天爷，我差点吓疯了。”他说道，“你快把我吓得魂飞魄散了。”

他又看了看那具尸体，这个曾经属于一个可怜男人的肉身，随后，他在惊愕中后退了几步。

“可是他已经眼瞎了呀。”

“是的，他眼睛瞎了快一年了。”





第五十七章


这时候，我们的谈话被库特拉斯太太的出现打断了，她出去串门了。她走进来，就像一只风帆鼓鼓的小船。她是风风火火、威风八面的人物，又高又胖，胸围很宽，腰身很圆，但胸前让人吃惊地用束腰勒得紧紧的，她长着显眼的鹰钩鼻子，双下巴，身体挺得很直。热带的气候容易使人慵懒，可她没有屈服于慵懒，一刻也没闲着，而是与这个区域的人形成鲜明对比，她顽固地更加活跃，更加爱热闹，更加爱拍板，而在热带气候下的人们不大可能会是她那副样子。她显然还是一个滔滔不绝的健谈者，到家后，就一口气也不停地讲着奇闻逸事和家长里短。她的出现，使我们刚才的谈话变得似乎很遥远和不真实了。

一会儿后，库特拉斯医生对我说道：

“斯特里克兰送给我的那幅画，我还挂在书房[120]里呢，”他说，“你愿意看看吗？”

“乐意之至。”

我们站起身，他领着我走到环绕房屋的露台上。我们停下脚步，看了一会儿花园中遍布各处的姹紫嫣红的鲜花。

“很长时间了，我脑海里的回忆总是挥之不去，我老想着斯特里克兰在他屋里墙壁上所绘的非比寻常的装饰画。”他若有所思地说道。

我脑子里也正想着它。在我看来，似乎斯特里克兰最后终于完成了自己想表达的所有东西。他静静地工作，知道那是他最后的机会。我想他一定用画作讲出了他对生活的理解，对世界的预言。我还想到，也许在这儿他最终找到了平静，附在他身体里的恶魔也最终被驱逐了。他的一生就是为这幅作品所做的痛苦准备，随着壁画的大功告成，安息终于降临到他那远离尘嚣而又饱受折磨的灵魂上了。他愿意拥抱死亡，因为他已经完成了他的使命。

“壁画的主题是什么？”我问道。

“我说不清。它很奇怪又很有想象力，是世界创立之初的景象，是亚当和夏娃所在的伊甸园——我怎么知道呢？[121]——它是对人体之美的赞美诗，无论是男人的，还是女人的；它是对大自然的讴歌，大自然既崇高又冷漠，既可爱又残酷。它给了你一种空间无限、时间永恒的可怕感觉。因为他画的这些树是我每天都能见到的，什么椰子树呀、榕树呀、火焰花呀、鳄梨呀，但在他的画笔下，这些树都大不一样了，好像它们有一种精神和神秘，而这种精神和神秘是我苦苦追寻而又求之不得的。画的色彩也是我常见的颜色，然而又有所不同，每种色彩都有自己独特的意义。还有画上裸体的男男女女，他们就是泥土，就是上帝造人时所用的泥土，可同时，他们身上又有了某种神圣的东西。你看见了人身上的原始本能赤裸裸地展现在你面前，你害怕了，因为你分明看见了你自己。”

库斯特拉医生耸了耸肩膀，露出笑容。

“你可能会笑话我，我是个物质主义者，我也是个粗俗、肥胖的人——有点像福斯塔夫[122]，对不对？——抒情诗的模式不适合我，我把自己搞得很可笑，但是我以前从来没有见过一幅画作能给我留下如此深的印象。说老实话[123]，这种感觉跟我走进罗马西斯廷教堂的感觉如出一辙。在那所小教堂里，我也是对在穹顶上作画的画家之伟大心怀敬畏，那就是天才，让人惊叹和折服，我觉出了自己的渺小和微不足道。然而，你对迈克尔·米开朗琪罗的伟大还是有心理准备的，而我对斯特里克兰的壁画是毫无准备的。在塔拉瓦奥上面大山的峡谷中，在远离文明的、当地人的小木屋里，看到这些画后所带给我的巨大震撼是可想而知的。迈克尔·米开朗琪罗起码还是心智健全、身体健康的。他的那些伟大的作品有着崇高的宁静。但是在这儿，虽然我看到的也有美，但还有让人心神不宁的东西。我不知道这种东西到底是什么，它让我觉得不安。给我的感觉好像是你正坐在一个你明知道空无一人的房间的隔壁，可就是不知道为什么，你心头有一种可怕的感觉：那个房间有人。你自己责怪自己，你知道那只不过是你神经过敏——然而，然而……过了一小会儿，几乎不可能去抵抗紧紧扼住你的恐惧，你在无形恐惧越抓越紧的掌心中是那么的无助。是的，我必须得承认，当我听说那些奇异的杰作被毁掉的时候，我完全不感到遗憾。”

“被毁掉了？”我喊道。

“是呀。[124]难道你不知道？”

“我怎么会知道？我真的从来没听人说过这件作品；可是我原以为它或许落到了某位私人收藏家的手中，甚至直到现在，也没有一个斯特里克兰绘画作品的目录。”

“当他变瞎了以后，他就坐在那两间他作画的房间里，坐上一个小时又一个小时，用已经失去视力的眼睛看着他的作品，他看到的东西也许超过了以前生活中曾经看到过的一切。爱塔告诉我说，他从不抱怨他的命运，也从未失去过勇气。到了最后时刻，他的思想保持着安详和不受外界干扰。然而，他让她做出承诺，当她埋葬他以后——我告诉过你我亲手给他挖了坟墓吗？因为没有一个当地人敢接近那所受到感染的房子，我们埋了他，她和我，用三条缝在一起的帕利欧把他包裹起来，把他埋在了杧果树下——他让她保证，她会一把火烧了房子，什么也不要留下，直到一切在地上化为灰烬，不剩一根木棍。”

我有好一阵子没有说话，因为我在想着心事。后来，我说道：

“那么说，一直到最后，他还是老样子。”

“你能理解吗？我必须告诉你，我认为劝说她不要烧掉房子是我的责任。”

“后来你真去劝说她了吗？”

“是的，因为我知道房子里有一个天才的作品，我认为我们没有权利剥夺世界欣赏它的机会。但是爱塔不听我的。她已经做出了承诺。我不能留在那儿去目睹这种野蛮行径，我也是后来听说她所做的一切。她把煤油倒在了干燥的地板和露兜树叶编织的垫子上，然后就点了一把火。不一会儿工夫，什么也没剩下，除了还在冒烟的灰烬。一个伟大的艺术杰作不复存在了。”

“我认为斯特里克兰自己也知道那是幅杰作。他已经取得了想要的成就，他的生活圆满了。他创造了一个世界，看见这个世界很美好，随后，在骄傲和蔑视当中，他又亲手毁掉了它。”

“不过，现在该让你看看我的画了。”库特拉斯医生一边说，一边继续向前走。

“后来爱塔和他们的孩子怎么样了？”

“他们去了马克萨斯群岛，她在那儿有一些亲戚。我听说后来那个男孩子在一艘喀麦隆的纵帆船上当水手。人们说他长得非常像他的父亲。”

到了一扇门前，这门连着露台和医生的诊室，他又停下来，笑着说：

“那是一幅水果静物画。你也许认为它不太适合挂在医生的诊室里。但我的太太不愿意把它挂在客厅里，她说这画给人一种猥亵感。”

“一幅水果静物画！”我吃惊地喊了出来，心想它怎么会给人那种感觉。

我们走进了诊室，我的目光立刻落到了那幅画上面，我端详了它好长一段时间。

画上有一堆杧果、香蕉、橘子，以及其他一些我不知道的东西。乍一看，它就是一幅正儿八经的静物画，在一个漫不经心的人看来，它完全可以在后印象派的画展中展出，作为这个流派非常优秀，但不是太杰出的代表。但是，也许后来它会时常在记忆中浮现，他也好奇为什么会这样，我认为他以后也绝不可能会完全忘记它。

它的色彩是如此的奇怪，以至于言语都无法形容这些色彩给了人多么不安的感情，阴沉的蓝色很晦暗，就像精雕细琢的天青石[125]碗，然而还有一种颤动的光泽，让人感到神秘生命的悸动；还有紫色，像腐烂的生肉，看上去很恐怖，却又带着发热的、肉欲的激情，唤起了人们对海利欧加巴鲁斯[126]治下的罗马帝国模模糊糊的回忆；红色，很耀眼，就像冬青树上的浆果——让人想起英格兰的圣诞节和皑皑白雪，一派喜庆，还有孩子们的嬉戏——但画家又运用自己的魔笔，使这种光泽柔和下来，让它呈现出有如乳鸽胸脯一样的柔嫩，叫人神怡心驰；深黄色，随着一种不自然的激情死而复苏，变成了一种绿色，就像春天般的芬芳，又像山涧溪水溅起水花般的清纯。谁能说得清楚怎样的痛苦幻想才能创作出这样的水果？它们属于赫斯珀里得斯[127]在波利尼西亚果园中的果实吧，在这些水果中，有种奇怪的、活生生的东西，好像它们是在世界尚处于黑暗的历史阶段创造出来的，在那个阶段东西还没有固定的形状。这些水果过于丰盛了，它们带有浓郁的热带气息，它们似乎具有一种独特的忧郁激情，那是施加了魔法的水果，吃上一口，也许就可以打开只有上帝知道的灵魂秘密的大门，进入想象中的神秘宫殿。它们孕育着无法预知的危险，吃了它们会把一个人变成野兽或者神仙。所有健康和自然的东西，所有淳朴人们简单的欢乐，幸福的关系，都要在惊慌中躲开它们，然而，它们又有一种可怕的吸引力，就像能明辨善与恶的智慧树上的果实一样，它们是可怕的，能把人带入未知的可能中。

最后，我转身离开。我觉得斯特里克兰已经把他的秘密带入到坟墓当中去了。

“嗨，雷内，亲爱的，”[128]这时传来库特拉斯太太欢快的大声呼唤，“你一直都在干吗呢？这儿有开胃酒[129]，问问那位先生[130]是否愿意喝几杯奎奎纳杜邦内特酒。”

“非常愿意，夫人。[131]”我边说边走了出来，回到露台上。

画的魔咒被打破了。





第五十八章


到了我跟塔希提岛说再见的时候了。按照岛上好客的习俗，凡是跟我有过交往的人都会送给我礼物——用椰树叶编织的篮子，露兜树叶编织的垫子、扇子等。蒂亚瑞送给我三颗小珍珠，还有用她胖乎乎的双手做的三罐番石榴酱。邮船在从惠灵顿到旧金山的航行途中，要在塔希提岛停留二十四个小时，此时，船拉响了汽笛，提醒乘客们赶紧登船了。蒂亚瑞把我紧紧抱在她那宽阔的胸口之间，我感觉到自己似乎沉入了波涛汹涌的大海，而且把她红红的嘴唇压在了我的唇上，泪水在她的眼眶中打转。当船喷着蒸汽缓缓驶出环礁湖，小心翼翼地绕过湖口的礁石，然后驶向茫茫大海，一种悲怆之情在我心中油然而生。微风拂面，吹来陆地上舒爽的气息。塔希提岛在视线中越来越远，我也清楚我应该和它永远不会再见了，我生命中的一章已经翻过了页，我觉得离无从逃避的死神又近了一小步。

一个月过后没多久，我就又回到了伦敦。在处理完某些不得不立即办的事情之后，想到斯特里克兰太太也许会愿意听听她丈夫最后岁月的故事，我给她写了一封信。战前我很长一段时间没看见她了，所以我不得不在电话号码簿上寻找她的地址。她定了一个见面的时间，于是我去了她现在住的，在坎普顿山的一栋整齐利落的小房子。这个时候，她已经快六十岁了，但是保养得很好，没人会把她当成五十好几的人。她的面容，虽然瘦削但没有多少皱纹，属于那种岁月只留下了优雅而没有雕刻沧桑的类型，所以你会猜想她年轻时一定很好看，比她实际相貌要漂亮得多。她的头发还没有完全灰白，梳理得很精致，黑色长裙也很入时。我记得听人说过她的姐姐，麦克安德鲁太太，比她的丈夫还多活了几年，死后把所有财产都留给了斯特里克兰太太。看到这栋房子的外表和开门用人整洁的打扮，我能判断出这笔遗产数目不菲，足够让这个寡妇过着体面的舒适生活。

我被领进客厅的时候，发现斯特里克兰太太正有一位客人。当我发现这个人的身份后，就知道通知我这个时候来不是没有原因的。这位客人是冯·布舍·泰勒先生，一个美国人，斯特里克兰太太一边向他展现迷人的满含歉意的笑容，一边向我详细地介绍了他的情况。

“你知道，我们英国人孤陋寡闻，真是太可怕了。如果我不得不做些解释的话，您一定要原谅我。”随后，她转过身对着我说：“冯·布舍·泰勒先生是著名的美国评论家，如果你没读过他的书的话，说明你的教育还有缺憾，你得立即补上这一课。他正打算写有关亲爱的查理的一些东西。他来拜访正是问我有没有可以帮助他的地方。”

冯·布舍·泰勒先生人很瘦，脑袋却挺大，秃头，脑门突出，头皮闪闪发亮；在宽阔的前额之下，是一张黄黄的，有着很深皱纹的脸，看上去很小。他很安静和彬彬有礼，他说话带着新英格兰地区的口音。他的言谈举止冰冷、死板，让我禁不住暗自思忖，究竟为什么他要忙活研究查尔斯·斯特里克兰呢。斯特里克兰太太一提到她丈夫的名字，就显出一副温情脉脉的样子，让我忍不住想笑。当他们两个人交谈的时候，我把我们落座的这间屋子好好打量了一番。斯特里克兰太太是个紧跟时代步伐的人。与阿什利花园客厅的装饰相比，风格全变了，原来墙上贴的莫里斯墙纸已经不见了，素气的印花棉布窗帘也不见了，在四面墙上阿伦德尔版画也拿掉了。现在这间屋子闪耀着光怪陆离的色彩，我想知道她是否知道那些不同的色彩，对她来说是赶时髦，实际上来自于南太平洋岛上一个可怜画家的梦境。她自己解答了我这个疑问。

“你用的这些靠垫多棒呀！”冯·布舍·泰勒先生说道。

“您喜欢它们吗？”她笑着问道，“巴克斯特[132]设计的，您知道。”

然而，在墙上，挂着很多斯特里克兰最好作品的彩色复制品，是柏林一家出版社的创新。

“你正在看我的画。”她说道，并顺着我的目光望去，“当然了，我没法搞到原作，但是有这些也挺不错啦。出版社亲自送给我的，它们给我带来了巨大的安慰。”

“生活中有了它们，可以说是赏心悦目。”冯·布舍·泰勒先生说道。

“是的，它们非常具有装饰的效果。”

“那就是我深信不疑的看法之一，”冯·布舍·泰勒先生说道，“伟大的艺术总是有装饰的效果。”

他们的目光落在一幅画上，画上一个裸体女人正在给一个婴儿喂奶，一个女孩跪在他们的脚边，正举着一支鲜花给那个无动于衷的婴儿。远处一个满脸皱纹、骨瘦如柴的丑老太婆正在看着他们，那是斯特里克兰所画的“神圣家庭”[133]版本。我怀疑一家人坐在一起的人物，原型是在塔拉瓦奥上面大山中的一家人，画上的女人和孩子是爱塔和他的第一个儿子，我暗自思量，斯特里克兰太太是否想到过这一层事实。

我们继续着谈话。我对冯·布舍·泰勒先生说话的滴水不漏感到惊奇，凡是会引起哪怕是一丁点儿尴尬的话题，他都回避掉了。同时我也惊奇于斯特里克兰太太说话的圆滑，尽管她说的话没有一个字是假的，但是话里话外透着她和她丈夫的关系总是很融洽。最后，冯·布舍·泰勒先生站起身来准备告辞，他握着女主人的一只手，他向她说了一大篇文雅。虽然可能有点太咬文嚼字的感谢话，然后就离开了我们。

“我希望他没有让你感到厌烦，”当门在他身后关上了以后，她说道，“当然，有时这也是桩麻烦事儿，但是我觉得能够给人们提供一些查理的情况是我义不容辞的责任。这也是作为一个天才的妻子理所应当的责任。”

她用她那双讨人喜欢的眼睛看着我，还是那么坦诚、那么富有同情心，和二十多年前没有什么两样。我有点怀疑她是不是把我当成了傻瓜。

“想必你已经不再做打字的生意了吧？”我问道。

“哦，那是当然，”她漫不经心地答道，“我开办那个生意主要是因为兴趣，而不是别的什么原因。而且我的孩子们也劝说我把它卖掉，他们认为太耗费我的精力和体力了。”

我明白斯特里克兰太太已经忘了她曾经为生计做过不大体面的营生。她有这样一种真切的本能，那就是好女人只有依靠别人的钱生活，对她来说才是真正体面的事。

“他们现在都在家，”她说道，“我想他们愿意听听你要讲述的有关他们父亲的情况。你应该还记得罗伯特吧？我很高兴地告诉你，他已经被推荐获得陆军十字勋章了。”

她走到门边，喊了他们一声。随即进来了一个身穿卡其布军服的高个男子，脖子上系着牧师戴的硬领，英俊而且很有派头，一双直率的眼睛仍然和他还是个孩子的时候一模一样。他的身后跟着他的妹妹，她这时一定和我初次结识她母亲时她母亲的年龄相仿。她长得很像斯特里克兰太太，也给人一种印象，那就是她身为姑娘时，长得一定比她实际上漂亮得多。

“我估计你完全记不得他们了，”斯特里克兰太太说道，骄傲地笑了笑，“我女儿现在是罗纳尔森太太了，她丈夫是炮兵团的少校。”

“他是纯粹从士兵一步步升上来的，你知道。”罗纳尔森太太快活地说道，“那就是为什么他还只是个少校的原因。”

我仍然记得很久以前，我对她的预测，她一定会嫁给一个军人的。这是不可避免的事。她现在的举止做派俨然一副军人家属的样子，她一方面对人彬彬有礼、和蔼可亲，另一方面又很难掩饰她内心的信念，她就要与众不同，而罗伯特活泼风趣。

“真是缘分，您这次来，正好赶上我也在伦敦，”他说，“我只有三天的假期。”

“他老是着急回去。”他的母亲说道。

“好吧，这话倒是真的，我得承认，我在前线过得很棒，我交了很多好朋友，那真是一流的生活状态。当然，战争是可怕的，是要死人的，但是它也培养了人最好的品质，这一点毋庸置疑。”

接下来，我告诉了他们我所了解的查尔斯·斯特里克兰在塔希提岛的情况。我想没有必要提爱塔和她孩子的事情，除了这个事实，剩下的我都一五一十地告诉了他们。当我讲到他的惨死后，就没有再往下说了。有那么一两分钟，我们都沉默了。后来，罗伯特·斯特里克兰划着一根火柴，点亮了一支香烟。

“上帝的磨盘磨得很慢，但会磨得很细。”他说道，显得有点玩深沉。

斯特里克兰太太和罗纳尔森太太低着头，带着些许虔诚的表情，我敢肯定，这种表情表明她们认为罗伯特刚讲的话来自《圣经》[134]。的确，我就不相信罗伯特·斯特里克兰就没有她们俩的那种错觉。不知为什么，我突然想到了斯特里克兰和爱塔生的那个儿子。他们告诉我，他是个快乐、开朗的年轻人。在我的脑海中，仿佛看见他正在纵帆船上工作，他上身什么也没穿，只在下身套了一件粗蓝布工装裤；夜晚，船在清风的吹动下，轻快地滑行；水手们聚集在上层甲板上，船长和押运员懒洋洋地坐在帆布躺椅上，抽着他们的烟斗。斯特里克兰和爱塔的儿子正在和另外一个小伙子跳舞，在手风琴呼哧带喘的音乐伴奏下，舞跳得很狂野。头顶上是蓝天，还有满天星斗，以及空旷无垠的太平洋。

《圣经》中的一句话滑到了嘴边，但是我还是管住了舌头，因为我知道，牧师们认为俗人要是在他们的自留地上窃取果实，是有那么一点亵渎上帝的。我的叔叔亨利，在威特斯泰堡教区做了二十七年牧师，在这些场合下，会习惯性地说，恶魔要干坏事，总是要引用《圣经》上的话。他一直念念不忘一个先令能买十三只大牡蛎的日子。





译后记


当《月亮与六便士》一书的最后一行终于翻译完成时，不但让我亲身体会到“译事三难”，更加体会到我国近代翻译家严复的那句名言“一名之立，旬月踟蹰”所说的个中滋味。为了找到一个可能谈不上传神，但能比较好达意的措辞、句子，我确实也曾搜肠刮肚、夜不能寐；当有了一个比较让自己满意的翻译结果时，我也毫不顾及左右，或拍案，或抚额，或自言自语，或哑然失笑。但不管怎么说，对这部经典作品的翻译，既可以说是对自己的一个挑战，又可以说是圆了自己的一个梦。

回想二十多年前，在大学的英美文学课上，虽然老师对毛姆的作品有过简单的介绍，但给自己留下的印象并不太多。后来，自己又读了英语专业的硕士研究生，导师会对英美经典文学作品进行导读、分析，学生们讨论、撰写读书笔记。在那个时候，我第一次真正开始接触毛姆的原作。但说实话，那时对他的作品真谈不上喜爱，反而觉得他啰里啰唆，动辄就开始讲上一通大道理，文字也晦涩难懂，远不及海明威的作品简洁、有趣。再后来，自己当了大学老师，开始讲英美文学，因为毛姆在我学生时代给我留下了阴影，所以，即使选读中有毛姆的作品，也往往故意绕过——反正是选读，让学生读哪篇作品或者自己讲哪篇作品，自己说了算。除了英美文学，我还讲英语写作和翻译，甚至主编了英汉翻译教材。当时，圈子里有这样一句戏言，想来不无道理，这句话的大意是：“大学教师做不了翻译的去讲翻译理论，讲不了翻译理论的去编翻译教材。”自己硕士学的是英美文学，而且还编了翻译教材，但竟然没有翻译过英语文学作品，说起来底气确实有点不足，而第一次做翻译，就翻译当学生时就发怵的毛姆，这不能不说是个挑战。

虽说没翻译过文学作品，但并不是说这些年自己纯粹在“纸上谈兵”，我十年前在北京师范大学又攻读了比较教育专业的博士，所以，有关教育教学的译著也有了两本，相关学术文章翻译了不下数十篇。但学术翻译与文学翻译毕竟有着很大差别，所幸的是，原来教给学生的那些翻译技巧无论是对学术翻译还是文学翻译，毕竟还是有很多共通之处的，在遣词造句上对于自己翻译这本书，还是有很大帮助的。也许我个人的成长经历中，也跟书中主人公斯特里克兰四十岁开始学画画有着类似的地方。从不好的方面来看，叫走了很多弯路；从好的方面来说，叫大器晚成。1980年代，我高考考上大专，读的是机械制造专业，后来在工厂干了整整八年。如同斯特里克兰干的是证券经纪，心中念念不忘的是绘画。我那时虽然画的是机械制图，但心中念念不忘我的文学梦。因为我有一个爱阅读的母亲。在我还不识字时，包括四大名著在内的众多小说，已经被母亲作为睡前读物都读给了我听。按照现在学前教育学的观点，这些小说对我幼小的心灵来说，显然是“少儿不宜”的。但多少次我就在母亲的碎碎念中进入了梦乡，一个文学梦也许在那时就扎了根。同样，翻译文学作品和自己创作小说又是两码事。但这次翻译过程中遇到瓶颈时，我忍不住在微信朋友圈中吐槽：“等翻完毛姆的这部长篇小说，我也尝试创作一部。某种程度上说，写小说比译小说似乎更为简单。”显然，我那时觉得写小说可以天马行空，率性而为，而译小说必须人云亦云，不可造次。现在回想起来，翻译未尝不是一种创作。这种语言上的再创作，也可以说是圆了我的一个文学梦。

好在翻译时，不知所云的时候并不多。倒不是自己的学问有多大的长进，而是随着岁月流逝，阅历渐长，年龄早已不惑，正向知天命逼近，对于毛姆在书中夹叙夹议的、年轻时觉得深奥莫测的话，终于有了切身的体会，难免心有戚戚焉，所以理解起来并不难了。这时，我才体会到，毛姆先前在德国海德堡学哲学，后来在英国的圣托马斯医院学医学，在他的书中既有对人性的剖析，又有对人生的感慨，那是有着深厚的根基的。想当年自己做学生时年轻不更事，所以觉得毛姆的那些大道理既玄虚，又面目可憎，实在是自己的浅薄。在这本书中，我们不难感受到毛姆艺术修养的深厚。书中提到的西方著名艺术家有十多位，诗人、作家七八位，引用希腊神话、莎士比亚戏剧中的人物近十位，多处用到法文、希腊文、拉丁文等。每一次为注释去寻找相关资料，都会让自己的知识面得到拓宽，艺术修养得到加深。

当然，这本经典作品，早先有大翻译家傅惟慈先生的译本，近有苏福忠先生的译本。但正如我上面所言，翻译也是一个再创作的过程，而且经典重译也总能发现以前译本的疏漏之处，不是说后生可畏，能够超越前辈，而是确实是站在巨人肩膀上的缘故。这次的译本主要是中英双语对照读物，所以从语言学习的角度出发，我尽量直译，在句子结构和顺序上没有做大的调整，主要就是考虑到这一点。也就是说，尽量求其“信”，力图能够“达”，至于“雅”，可能是我力不能逮了。

这本书大部分是我暑假陪年迈父母在山东某地海边度假时完成的，那是一段很放松的时光；一部分是在开学后在白天工作之余挑灯夜战完成的，那是一段很忙碌的时光；最后的一千多字，是我陪爱人不是在医院，就是在去医院的路上，抽空揣摩，每天找机会翻译一两百字，整整一个星期才完成的，那是一段焦虑的时光。至于这本书翻译得好与坏，只好交给时光去检验了。

Chapter I


I confess that when first I made acquaintance with Charles Strickland I never for a moment discerned that there was in him anything out of the ordinary. Yet now few will be found to deny his greatness.I do not speak of that greatness which is achieved by the fortunate politician or the successful soldier；that is a quality which belongs to the place he occupies rather than to the man；and a change of circumstance reduces it to very discreet proportions.The Prime Minister out of office is seen, too often, to have been but a pompous rhetorician, and the General without an army is but the tame hero of a market town.The greatness of Charles Strickland was authentic.It may be that you do not like his art, but at all events you can hardly refuse it the tribute of your interest.He disturbs and arrests.The time has passed when he was an object of ridicule, and it is no longer a mark of eccentricity to defend or of perversity to extol him.His faults are accepted as the necessary complement to his merits.It is still possible to discuss his place in art, and the adulation of his admirers is perhaps no less capricious than the disparagement of his detractors；but one thing can never be doubtful, and that is that he had genius.To my mind the most interesting thing in art is the personality of the artist；and if that is singular, I am willing to excuse a thousand faults.I suppose Velasquez was a better painter than El Greco, but custom stales one's admiration for him：the Cretan, sensual and tragic, proffers the mystery of his soul like a standing sacrifice.The artist, painter, poet, or musician, by his decoration, sublime or beautiful, satisfes the aesthetic sense；but that is akin to the sexual instinct, and shares its barbarity：he lays before you also the greater gift of himself.To pursue his secret has something of the fascination of a detective story.It is a riddle which shares with the universe the merit of having no answer.The most insignifcant of Strickland's works suggests a personality which is strange, tormented, and complex；and it is this surely which prevents even those who do not like his pictures from being indifferent to them；it is this which has excited so curious an interest in his life and character.

It was not till four years after Strickland's death that Maurice Huret wrote that article in the Mercure de France which rescued the unknown painter from oblivion and blazed the trail which succeeding writers, with more or less docility, have followed. For a long time no critic has enjoyed in France a more incontestable authority, and it was impossible not to be impressed by the claims he made；they seemed extravagant；but later judgements have confirmed his estimate, and the reputation of Charles Strickland is now firmly established on the lines which he laid down.The rise of this reputation is one of the most romantic incidents in the history of art.But I do not propose to deal with Charles Strickland's work except in so far as it touches upon his character.I cannot agree with the painters who claim superciliously that the layman can understand nothing of painting, and that he can best show his appreciation of their works by silence and a cheque-book.It is a grotesque misapprehension which sees in art no more than a craft comprehensible perfectly only to the craftsman：art is a manifestation of emotion, and emotion speaks a language that all may understand.But I will allow that the critic who has not a practical knowledge of technique is seldom able to say anything on the subject of real value, and my ignorance of painting is extreme.Fortunately, there is no need for me to risk the adventure, since my friend, Mr.Edward Leggatt, an able writer as well as an admirable painter, has exhaustively discussed Charles Strickland's work in a little book 1 which is a charming example of a style, for the most part, less happily cultivated in England than in France.

Maurice Huret in his famous article gave an outline of Charles Strickland's life which was well calculated to whet the appetites of the inquiring. With his disinterested passion for art, he had a real desire to call the attention of the wise to a talent which was in the highest degree original；but he was too good a journalist to be unaware that the“human interest”would enable him more easily to effect his purpose.And when such as had come in contact with Strickland in the past, writers who had known him in London, painters who had met him in the cafés of Montmartre, discovered to their amazement that where they had seen but an unsuccessful artist, like another, authentic genius had rubbed shoulders with them, there began to appear in the magazines of France and America a succession of articles, the reminiscences of one, the appreciation of another, which added to Strickland’s notoriety, and fed without satisfying the curiosity of the public.The subject was grateful, and the industrious Weitbrecht-Rotholz in his imposing monograph 2 has been able to give a remarkable list of authorities.

The faculty for myth is innate in the human race. It seizes with avidity upon any incidents, surprising or mysterious, in the career of those who have at all distinguished themselves from their fellows, and invents a legend to which it then attaches a fanatical belief.It is the protest of romance against the commonplace of life.The incidents of the legend become the hero's surest passport to immortality.The ironic philosopher refects with a smile that Sir Walter Raleigh is more safely enshrined in the memory of mankind because he set his cloak for the Virgin Queen to walk on than because he carried the English name to undiscovered countries.Charles Strickland lived obscurely.He made enemies rather than friends.It is not strange, then, that those who wrote of him should have eked out their scanty recollections with a lively fancy, and it is evident that there was enough in the little that was known of him to give opportunity to the romantic scribe；there was much in his life which was strange and terrible, in his character something outrageous, and in his fate not a little that was pathetic.In due course a legend arose of such circumstantiality that the wise historian would hesitate to attack it.

But a wise historian is precisely what the Rev. Robert Strickland is not.He wrote his biography 3 avowedly to“remove certain misconceptions which had gained currency”in regard to the later part of his father’s life, and which had“caused considerable pain to persons still living.”It is obvious that there was much in the commonly received account of Strickland’s life to embarrass a respectable family.I have read this work with a good deal of amusement, and upon this I congratulate myself, since it is colourless and dull.Mr.Strickland has drawn the portrait of an excellent husband and father, a man of kindly temper, industrious habits, and moral disposition.The modern clergyman has acquired in his study of the science which I believe is called exegesis an astonishing facility for explaining things away, but the subtlety with which the Rev.Robert Strickland has“interpreted”all the facts in his father’s life which a dutiful son might fnd it convenient to remember must surely lead him in the fullness of time to the highest dignities of the Church.I see already his muscular calves encased in the gaiters episcopal.It was a hazardous, though maybe a gallant thing to do, since it is probable that the legend commonly received has had no small share in the growth of Strickland’s reputation；for there are many who have been attracted to his art by the detestation in which they held his character or the compassion with which they regarded his death；and the son’s well-meaning efforts threw a singular chill upon the father’s admirers.It is due to no accident that when one of his most important works, The Woman of Samaria，4 was sold at Christie’s shortly after the discussion which followed the publication of Mr.Strickland’s biography, it fetched￡235 less than it had done nine months before, when it was bought by the distinguished collector whose sudden death had brought it once more under the hammer.Perhaps Charles Strickland’s power and originality would scarcely have suffced to turn the scale if the remarkable mythopoeic faculty of mankind had not brushed aside with impatience a story which disappointed all its craving for the extraordinary.And presently Dr.Weitbrecht-Rotholz produced the work which fnally set at rest the misgivings of all lovers of art.

Dr. Weitbrecht-Rotholz belongs to that school of historians which believes that human nature is not only about as bad as it can be, but a great deal worse；and certainly the reader is safer of entertainment in their hands than in those of the writers who take a malicious pleasure in representing the great fgures of romance as patterns of the domestic virtues.For my part, I should be sorry to think that there was nothing between Antony and Cleopatra but an economic situation；and it will require a great deal more evidence than is ever likely to be available, thank God, to persuade me that Tiberius was as blameless a monarch as King George V.Dr.Weitbrecht-Rotholz has dealt in such terms with the Rev.Robert Strickland's innocent biography that it is difficult to avoid feeling a certain sympathy for the unlucky parson.His decent reticence is branded as hypocrisy, his circumlocutions are roundly called lies, and his silence is vilifed as treachery.And on the strength of peccadilloes, reprehensible in an author, but excusable in a son, the Anglo-Saxon race is accused of prudishness, humbug, pretentiousness, deceit, cunning, and bad cooking.Personally I think it was rash of Mr.Strickland, in refuting the account which had gained belief of a certain“unpleasantness”between his father and mother, to state that Charles Strickland in a letter written from Paris had described her as“an excellent woman，”since Dr.Weitbrecht-Rotholz was able to print the letter in facsimile, and it appears that the passage referred to ran in fact as follows：God damn my wife.She is an excellent woman.I wish she was in hell.It is not thus that the Church in its great days dealt with evidence that was unwelcome.

Dr. Weitbrecht-Rotholz was an enthusiastic admirer of Charles Strickland, and there was no danger that he would whitewash him.He had an unerring eye for the despicable motive in actions that had all the appearance of innocence.He was a psycho-pathologist as well as a student of art, and the subconscious had few secrets from him.No mystic ever saw deeper meaning in common things.The mystic sees the ineffable and the psycho-pathologist the unspeakable.There is a singular fascination in watching the eagerness with which the learned author ferrets out every circumstance which may throw discredit on his hero.His heart warms to him when he can bring forward some example of cruelty or meanness, and he exults like an inquisitor at the auto da fé of an heretic when with some forgotten story he can confound the flial piety of the Rev.Robert Strickland.His industry has been amazing.Nothing has been too small to escape him, and you may be sure that if Charles Strickland left a laundry bill unpaid it will be given you in extenso, and if he forebore to return a borrowed half-crown no detail of the transaction will be omitted.





Chapter II


When so much has been written about Charles Strickland, it may seem unnecessary that I should write more. A painter's monument is his work.It is true I knew him more intimately than most：I met him first before ever he became a painter, and I saw him not infrequently during the diffcult years he spent in Paris；but I do not suppose I should ever have set down my recollections if the hazards of the war had not taken me to Tahiti.There, as is notorious, he spent the last years of his life；and there I came across persons who were familiar with him.I fnd myself in a position to throw light on just that part of his tragic career which has remained most obscure.If they who believe in Strickland's greatness are right, the personal narratives of such as knew him in the flesh can hardly be superfluous.What would we not give for the reminiscences of someone who had been as intimately acquainted with El Greco as I was with Strickland？

But I seek refuge in no such excuses. I forget who it was that recommended men for their soul's good to do each day two things they disliked：it was a wise man, and it is a precept that I have followed scrupulously；for every day I have got up and I have gone to bed.But there is in my nature a strain of asceticism, and I have subjected my fesh each week to a more severe mortifcation.I have never failed to read the Literary Supplement of The Times.It is a salutary discipline to consider the vast number of books that are written, the fair hopes with which their authors see them published, and the fate which awaits them.What chance is there that any book will make its way among that multitude？And the successful books are but the successes of a season.Heaven knows what pains the author has been at, what bitter experiences he has endured and what heartache suffered, to give some chance reader a few hours'relaxation or to while away the tedium of a journey.And if I may judge from the reviews, many of these books are well and carefully written；much thought has gone to their composition；to some even has been given the anxious labour of a lifetime.The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of his thoughts；and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.

Now the war has come, bringing with it a new attitude. Youth has turned to gods we of an earlier day knew not, and it is possible to see already the direction in which those who come after us will move.The younger generation, conscious of strength and tumultuous, have done with knocking at the door；they have burst in and seated themselves in our seats.The air is noisy with their shouts.Of their elders some, by imitating the antics of youth, strive to persuade themselves that their day is not yet over；they shout with the lustiest, but the war-cry sounds hollow in their mouth；they are like poor wantons attempting with pencil, paint, and powder, with shrill gaiety, to recover the illusion of their spring.The wiser go their way with a decent grace.In their chastened smile is an indulgent mockery.They remember that they too trod down a sated generation, with just such clamour and with just such scorn, and they foresee that these brave torchbearers will presently yield ；their place also.There is no last word.The new evangel was old when Nineveh reared her greatness to the sky.These gallant words which seem so novel to those that speak them were said in accents scarcely changed a hundred times before.The pendulum swings backwards and forwards.The circle is ever travelled anew.

Sometimes a man survives a considerable time from an era in which he had his place into one which is strange to him, and then the curious are offered one of the most singular spectacles in the human comedy. Who now, for example, thinks of George Crabbe？He was a famous poet in his day, and the world recognized his genius with a unanimity which the greater complexity of modern life has rendered infrequent.He had learnt his craft at the school of Alexander Pope, and he wrote moral stories in rhymed couplets.Then came the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, and the poets sang new songs.Mr.Crabbe continued to write moral stories in rhymed couplets.I think he must have read the verse of these young men who were making so great a stir in the world, and I fancy he found it poor stuff.Of course, much of it was.But the odes of Keats and of Wordsworth, a poem or two by Coleridge, a few more by Shelley, discovered vast realms of the spirit that none had explored before.Mr.Crabbe was as dead as mutton, but Mr.Crabbe continued to write moral stories in rhymed couplets.I have read desultorily the writings of the younger generation.It may be that among them a more fervid Keats, a more ethereal Shelley, has already published numbers the world will willingly remember.I cannot tell.I admire their polish—their youth is already so accomplished that it seems absurd to speak of promise-I marvel at the felicity of their style；but with all their copiousness（their vocabulary suggests that they fngered Roget's Thesaurus in their cradles）they say nothing to me：to my mind they know too much and feel too obviously；I cannot stomach the heartiness with which they slap me on the back or the emotion with which they hurl themselves on my bosom；their passion seems to me a little anaemic and their dreams a trife dull. I do not like them.I am on the shelf.I will continue to write moral stories in rhymed couplets.But I should be thrice a fool if I did it for aught but my own entertainment.





Chapter III


But all this is by the way.

I was very young when I wrote my frst book. By a lucky chance it excited attention, and various persons sought my acquaintance.

It is not without melancholy that I wander among my recollections of the world of letters in London when first, bashful but eager, I was introduced to it. It is long since I frequented it, and if the novels that describe its present singularities are accurate much in it is now changed.The venue is different.Chelsea and Bloomsbury have taken the place of Hampstead, Notting Hill Gate, and High Street, Kensington.Then it was a distinction to be under forty, but now to be more than twenty-fve is absurd.I think in those days we were a little shy of our emotions, and the fear of ridicule tempered the more obvious forms of pretentiousness.I do not believe that there was in that genteel Bohemia an intensive culture of chastity, but I do not remember so crude a promiscuity as seems to be practised in the present day.We did not think it hypocritical to draw over our vagaries the curtain of a decent silence.The spade was not invariably called a bloody shovel.Woman had not yet altogether come into her own.

I lived near Victoria Station, and I recall long excursions by bus to the hospitable houses of the literary. In my timidity I wandered up and down the street while I screwed up my courage to ring the bell；and then, sick with apprehension, was ushered into an airless room full of people.I was introduced to this celebrated person after that one, and the kind words they said about my book made me excessively uncomfortable.I felt they expected me to say clever things, and I never could think of any till after the party was over.I tried to conceal my embarrassment by handing round cups of tea and rather ill-cut bread-and-butter.I wanted no one to take notice of me, so that I could observe these famous creatures at my ease and listen to the clever things they said.

I have a recollection of large, unbending women with great noses and rapacious eyes, who wore their clothes as though they were armour；and of little, mouse-like spinsters, with soft voices and a shrewd glance. I never ceased to be fascinated by their persistence in eating buttered toast with their gloves on, and I observed with admiration the unconcern with which they wiped their fngers on their chair when they thought no one was looking.It must have been bad for the furniture, but I suppose the hostess took her revenge on the furniture of her friends when, in turn, she visited them.Some of them were dressed fashionably, and they said they couldn't for the life of them see why you should be dowdy just because you had written a novel；if you had a neat fgure you might as well make the most of it, and a smart shoe on a small foot had never prevented an editor from taking your“stuff.”But others thought this frivolous, and they wore“art fabrics”and barbaric jewellery.The men were seldom eccentric in appearance.They tried to look as little like authors as possible.They wished to be taken for men of the world, and could have passed anywhere for the managing clerks of a city firm.They always seemed a little tired.I had never known writers before, and I found them very strange, but I do not think they ever seemed to me quite real.

I remember that I thought their conversation brilliant, and I used to listen with astonishment to the stinging humour with which they would tear a brother-author to pieces the moment that his back was turned. The artist has this advantage over the rest of the world, that his friends offer not only their appearance and their character to his satire, but also their work.I despaired of ever expressing myself with such aptness or with such fuency.In those days conversation was still cultivated as an art；a neat repartee was more highly valued than the crackling of thorns under a pot；and the epigram, not yet a mechanical appliance by which the dull may achieve a semblance of wit, gave sprightliness to the small talk of the urbane.It is sad that I can remember nothing of all this scintillation.But I think the conversation never settled down so comfortably as when it turned to the details of the trade which was the other side of the art we practised.When we had done discussing the merits of the latest book, it was natural to wonder how many copies had been sold, what advance the author had received, and how much he was likely to make out of it.Then we would speak of this publisher and of that, comparing the generosity of one with the meanness of another；we would argue whether it was better to go to one who gave handsome royalties or to another who“pushed”a book for all it was worth.Some advertised badly and some well.Some were modern and some were old-fashioned.Then we would talk of agents and the offers they had obtained for us；of editors and the sort of contributions they welcomed, how much they paid a thousand, and whether they paid promptly or otherwise.To me it was all very romantic.It gave me an intimate sense of being a member of some mystic brotherhood.





Chapter IV


No one was kinder to me at that time than Rose Waterford. She combined a masculine intelligence with a feminine perversity, and the novels she wrote were original and disconcerting.It was at her house one day that I met Charles Strickland's wife.Miss Waterford was giving a tea-party, and her small room was more than usually full.Everyone seemed to be talking, and I, sitting in silence, felt awkward；but I was too shy to break into any of the groups that seemed absorbed in their own affairs.Miss Waterford was a good hostess, and seeing my embarrassment came up to me.

“I want you to talk to Mrs. Strickland，”she said.“She's raving about your book.”

“What does she do？”I asked.

I was conscious of my ignorance, and if Mrs. Strickland was a well-known writer I thought it as well to ascertain the fact before I spoke to her.

Rose Waterford cast down her eyes demurely to give greater effect to her reply.

“She gives luncheon-parties. You've only got to roar a little, and she'll ask you.”

Rose Waterford was a cynic. She looked upon life as an opportunity for writing novels and the public as her raw material.Now and then she invited members of it to her house if they showed an appreciation of her talent and entertained with proper lavishness.She held their weakness for lions in good-humoured contempt, but played to them her part of the distinguished woman of letters with decorum.

I was led up to Mrs. Strickland, and for ten minutes we talked together.I noticed nothing about her except that she had a pleasant voice.She had a flat in Westminster, overlooking the unfinished cathedral, and because we lived in the same neighbourhood we felt friendly disposed to one another.The Army and Navy Stores are a bond of union between all who dwell between the river and St.James's Park.Mrs.Strickland asked me for my address, and a few days later I received an invitation to luncheon.

My engagements were few, and I was glad to accept. When I arrived, a little late, because in my fear of being too early I had walked three times round the cathedral, I found the party already complete.Miss Waterford was there and Mrs.Jay, Richard Twining, and George Road.We were all writers.It was a fne day, early in spring, and we were in a good humour.We talked about a hundred things.Miss Waterford, torn between the aestheticism of her early youth, when she used to go to parties in sage green, holding a daffodil, and the flippancy of her maturer years, which tended to high heels and Paris frocks, wore a new hat.It put her in high spirits.I had never heard her more malicious about our common friends.Mrs.Jay, aware that impropriety is the soul of wit, made observations in tones hardly above a whisper that might well have tinged the snowy table-cloth with a rosy hue.Richard Twining bubbled over with quaint absurdities, and George Road, conscious that he need not exhibit a brilliancy which was almost a byword, opened his mouth only to put food into it.Mrs.Strickland did not talk much, but she had a pleasant gift for keeping the conversation general；and when there was a pause she threw in just the right remark to set it going once more.She was a woman of thirty-seven, rather tall, and plump, without being fat；she was not pretty, but her face was pleasing, chiefy, perhaps, on account of her kind brown eyes.Her skin was rather sallow.Her dark hair was elaborately dressed.She was the only woman of the three whose face was free of make-up, and by contrast with the others she seemed simple and unaffected.

The dining-room was in the good taste of the period. It was very severe.There was a high dado of white wood and a green paper on which were etchings by Whistler in neat black frames.The green curtains with their peacock design, hung in straight lines, and the green carpet, in the pattern of which pale rabbits frolicked among leafy trees, suggested the infuence of William Morris.There was blue delft on the chimneypiece.At that time there must have been fve hundred dining-rooms in London decorated in exactly the same manner.It was chaste, artistic, and dull.

When we left I walked away with Miss Waterford, and the fne day and her new hat persuaded us to saunter through the Park.

“That was a very nice party，”I said.

“Did you think the food was good？I told her that if she wanted writers she must feed them well.”

“Admirable advice，”I answered.“But why does she want them？”

Miss Waterford shrugged her shoulders.

“She finds them amusing. She wants to be in the movement.I fancy she's rather simple, poor dear, and she thinks we're all wonderful.After all, it pleases her to ask us to luncheon, and it doesn't hurt us.I like her for it.”

Looking back, I think that Mrs. Strickland was the most harmless of all the lion-hunters that pursue their quarry from the rarifed heights of Hampstead to the nethermost studios of Cheyne Walk.She had led a very quiet youth in the country, and the books that came down from Mudie's Library brought with them not only their own romance, but the romance of London.She had a real passion for reading（rare in her kind, who for the most part are more interested in the author than in his book, in the painter than in his pictures），and she invented a world of the imagination in which she lived with a freedom she never acquired in the world of every day.When she came to know writers it was like adventuring upon a stage which till then she had known only from the other side of the footlights.She saw them dramatically, and really seemed herself to live a larger life because she entertained them and visited them in their fastnesses.She accepted the rules with which they played the game of life as valid for them, but never for a moment thought of regulating her own conduct in accordance with them.Their moral eccentricities, like their oddities of dress, their wild theories and paradoxes, were an entertainment which amused her, but had not the slightest infuence on her convictions.

“Is there a Mr. Strickland？”I asked.

“Oh yes；he's something in the city. I believe he's a stockbroker.He's very dull.”

“Are they good friends？”

“They adore one another. You'll meet him if you dine there.But she doesn't often have people to dinner.He's very quiet.He's not in the least interested in literature or the arts.”

“Why do nice women marry dull men？”

“Because intelligent men won't marry nice women.”

I could not think of any retort to this, so I asked if Mrs. Strickland had children.

“Yes；she has a boy and a girl. They're both at school.”

The subject was exhausted, and we began to talk of other things.





Chapter V


During the summer I met Mrs. Strickland not infrequently.I went now and then to pleasant little luncheons at her fat, and to rather more formidable tea-parties.We took a fancy to one another.I was very young, and perhaps she liked the idea of guiding my virgin steps on the hard road of letters；while for me it was pleasant to have someone I could go to with my small troubles, certain of an attentive ear and reasonable counsel.Mrs.Strickland had the gift of sympathy.It is a charming faculty, but one often abused by those who are conscious of its possession：for there is something ghoulish in the avidity with which they will pounce upon the misfortune of their friends so that they may exercise their dexterity.It gushes forth like an oil-well, and the sympathetic pour out their sympathy with an abandon that is sometimes embarrassing to their victims.There are bosoms on which so many tears have been shed that I cannot bedew them with mine.Mrs.Strickland used her advantage with tact.You felt that you obliged her by accepting her sympathy.When, in the enthusiasm of my youth, I remarked on this to Rose Waterford, she said：

“Milk is very nice, especially with a drop of brandy in it, but the domestic cow is only too glad to be rid of it. A swollen udder is very uncomfortable.”

Rose Waterford had a blistering tongue. No one could say such bitter things；on the other hand, no one could do more charming ones.

There was another thing I liked in Mrs. Strickland.She managed her surroundings with elegance.Her fat was always neat and cheerful, gay with fowers, and the chintzes in the drawing-room, notwithstanding their severe design, were bright and pretty.The meals in the artistic little dining-room were pleasant；the table looked nice, the two maids were trim and comely, the food was well cooked.It was impossible not to see that Mrs.Strickland was an excellent housekeeper.And you felt sure that she was an admirable mother.There were photographs in the drawing-room of her son and daughter.The son-his name was Robert-was a boy of sixteen at Rugby；and you saw him in fannels and a cricket cap, and again in a tail-coat and a stand-up collar.He had his mother's candid brow and fine, reflective eyes.He looked clean, healthy, and normal.

“I don't know that he's very clever，”she said one day, when I was looking at the photograph，“but I know he's good. He has a charming character.”

The daughter was fourteen. Her hair, thick and dark like her mother's, fell over her shoulders in fne profusion, and she had the same kindly expression and sedate, untroubled eyes.

“They're both of them the image of you，”I said.

“Yes；I think they are more like me than their father.”

“Why have you never let me meet him？”I asked.

“Would you like to？”

She smiled, her smile was really very sweet, and she blushed a little；it was singular that a woman of that age should fush so readily. Perhaps her na?veté was her greatest charm.

“You know, he's not at all literary，”she said.“He's a perfect philistine.”

She said this not disparagingly, but affectionately rather, as though, by acknowledging the worst about him, she wished to protect him from the aspersions of her friends.

“He's on the Stock Exchange, and he's a typical broker. I think he'd bore you to death.”

“Does he bore you？”I asked.

“You see, I happen to be his wife. I'm very fond of him.”

She smiled to cover her shyness, and I fancied she had a fear that I would make the sort of gibe that such a confession could hardly have failed to elicit from Rose Waterford. She hesitated a little.Her eyes grew tender.

“He doesn't pretend to be a genius. He doesn't even make much money on the Stock Exchange.But he's awfully good and kind.”

“I think I should like him very much.”

“I'll ask you to dine with us quietly some time, but mind, you come at your own risk；don't blame me if you have a very dull evening.”





Chapter VI


But when at last I met Charles Strickland, it was under circumstances which allowed me to do no more than just make his acquaintance. One morning Mrs.Strickland sent me round a note to say that she was giving a dinner-party that evening, and one of her guests had failed her.She asked me to stop the gap.She wrote：

It’s only decent to warn you that you will be bored to extinction.It was a thoroughly dull party from the beginning, but if you will come I shall be uncommonly grateful.And you and I can have a little chat by ourselves.

It was only neighbourly to accept.

When Mrs. Strickland introduced me to her husband, he gave me a rather indifferent hand to shake.Turning to him gaily, she attempted a small jest.

“I asked him to show him that I really had a husband. I think he was beginning to doubt it.”

Strickland gave the polite little laugh with which people acknowledge a facetiousness in which they see nothing funny, but did not speak. New arrivals claimed my host's attention, and I was left to myself.When at last we were all assembled, waiting for dinner to be announced, I refected, while I chatted with the woman I had been asked to“take in，”that civilised man practises a strange ingenuity in wasting on tedious exercises the brief span of his life.It was the kind of party which makes you wonder why the hostess has troubled to bid her guests, and why the guests have troubled to come.There were ten people.They met with indifference, and would part with relief.It was, of course, a purely social function.The Stricklands“owed”dinners to a number of persons, whom they took no interest in, and so had asked them；these persons had accepted.Why？To avoid the tedium of dining tête-à-tête, to give their servants a rest, because there was no reason to refuse, because they were“owed”a dinner.

The dining-room was inconveniently crowded. There was a K.C.and his wife, a Government official and his wife, Mrs.Strickland's sister and her husband, Colonel MacAndrew, and the wife of a Member of Parliament.It was because the Member of Parliament found that he could not leave the House that I had been invited.The respectability of the party was portentous.The women were too nice to be well dressed, and too sure of their position to be amusing.The men were solid.There was about all of them an air of well-satisfed prosperity.

Everyone talked a little louder than natural in an instinctive desire to make the party go, and there was a great deal of noise in the room. But there was no general conversation.Each one talked to his neighbour；to his neighbour on the right during the soup, fish, and entrée；to his neighbour on the left during the roast, sweet, and savoury.They talked of the political situation, and of golf, of their children and the latest play, of the pictures at the Royal Academy, of the weather, and their plans for the holidays.There was never a pause, and the noise grew louder.Mrs.Strickland might congratulate herself that her party was a success.Her husband played his part with decorum.Perhaps he did not talk very much, and I fancied there was towards the end a look of fatigue in the faces of the women on either side of him.They were fnding him heavy.Once or twice Mrs.Strickland’s eyes rested on him somewhat anxiously.

At last she rose and shepherded the ladies out of the room. Strickland shut the door behind her, and, moving to the other end of the table, took his place between the K.C.and the Government offcial.He passed round the port again and handed us cigars.The K.C.remarked on the excellence of the wine, and Strickland told us where he got it.We began to chat about vintages and tobacco.The K.C.told us of a case he was engaged in, and the Colonel talked about polo.I had nothing to say and so sat silent, trying politely to show interest in the conversation；and because I thought no one was in the least concerned with me, examined Strickland at my ease.He was bigger than I expected：I do not know why I had imagined him slender and of insignificant appearance；in point of fact he was broad and heavy, with large hands and feet, and he wore his evening clothes clumsily.He gave you somewhat the idea of a coachman dressed up for the occasion.He was a man of forty, not good-looking, and yet not ugly, for his features were rather good；but they were all a little larger than life-size, and the effect was ungainly.He was clean shaven, and his large face looked uncomfortably naked.His hair was reddish, cut very short, and his eyes were small, blue or grey.He looked commonplace.I no longer wondered that Mrs.Strickland felt a certain embarrassment about him；he was scarcely a credit to a woman who wanted to make herself a position in the world of art and letters.It was obvious that he had no social gifts, but these a man can do without；he had no eccentricity even, to take him out of the common run；he was just a good, dull, honest, plain man.One would admire his excellent qualities, but avoid his company.He was null.He was probably a worthy member of society, a good husband and father, an honest broker；but there was no reason to waste one's time over him.





Chapter VII


The season was drawing to its dusty end, and everyone I knew was arranging to go away. Mrs.Strickland was taking her family to the coast of Norfolk, so that the children might have the sea and her husband golf.We said good-bye to one another, and arranged to meet in the autumn.But on my last day in town, coming out of the Stores, I met her with her son and daughter；like myself, she had been making her fnal purchases before leaving London, and we were both hot and tired.I proposed that we should all go and eat ices in the park.

I think Mrs. Strickland was glad to show me her children, and she accepted my invitation with alacrity.They were even more attractive than their photographs had suggested, and she was right to be proud of them.I was young enough for them not to feel shy, and they chattered merrily about one thing and another.They were extraordinarily nice, healthy young children.It was very agreeable under the trees.

When in an hour they crowded into a cab to go home, I strolled idly to my club. I was perhaps a little lonely, and it was with a touch of envy that I thought of the pleasant family life of which I had had a glimpse.They seemed devoted to one another.They had little private jokes of their own which, unintelligible to the outsider, amused them enormously.Perhaps Charles Strickland was dull judged by a standard that demanded above all things verbal scintillation；but his intelligence was adequate to his surroundings, and that is a passport, not only to reasonable success, but still more to happiness.Mrs.Strickland was a charming woman, and she loved him.I pictured their lives, troubled by no untoward adventure, honest, decent, and, by reason of those two upstanding, pleasant children, so obviously destined to carry on the normal traditions of their race and station, not without significance.They would grow old insensibly；they would see their son and daughter come to years of reason, marry in due course-the one a pretty girl, future mother of healthy children；the other a handsome, manly fellow, obviously a soldier；and at last, prosperous in their dignifed retirement, beloved by their descendants, after a happy, not unuseful life, in the fullness of their age they would sink into the grave.

That must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace. It reminds you of a placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vasty sea；but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indifferent, that you are troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness.Perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share of the great majority, something amiss.I recognized its social values, I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course.There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights.In my heart was a desire to live more dangerously.I was not unprepared for jagged rocks and treacherous shoals if I could only have change-change and the excitement of the unforeseen.





Chapter VIII


On reading over what I have written of the Stricklands, I am conscious that they must seem shadowy. I have been able to invest them with none of those characteristics which make the persons of a book exist with a real life of their own；and, wondering if the fault is mine, I rack my brains to remember idiosyncrasies which might lend them vividness.I feel that by dwelling on some trick of speech or some queer habit I should be able to give them a signifcance peculiar to themselves.As they stand they are like the fgures in an old tapestry；they do not separate themselves from the background, and at a distance seem to lose their pattern, so that you have little but a pleasing piece of colour.My only excuse is that the impression they made on me was no other.There was just that shadowiness about them which you fnd in people whose lives are part of the social organism, so that they exist in it and by it only.They are like cells in the body, essential, but, so long as they remain healthy, engulfed in the momentous whole.The Stricklands were an average family in the middle class.A pleasant, hospitable woman, with a harmless craze for the small lions of literary society；a rather dull man, doing his duty in that state of life in which a merciful Providence had placed him；two nice-looking, healthy children.Nothing could be more ordinary.I do not know that there was anything about them to excite the attention of the curious.

When I reflect on all that happened later, I ask myself if I was thick-witted not to see that there was in Charles Strickland at least something out of the common. Perhaps.I think that I have gathered in the years that intervene between then and now a fair knowledge of mankind, but even if when I first met the Stricklands I had the experience which I have now, I do not believe that I should have judged them differently.But because I have learnt that man is incalculable, I should not at this time of day be so surprised by the news that reached me when in the early autumn I returned to London.

I had not been back twenty-four hours before I ran across Rose Waterford in Jermyn Street.

“You look very gay and sprightly，”I said.“What's the matter with you？”

She smiled, and her eyes shone with a malice I knew already. It meant that she had heard some scandal about one of her friends, and the instinct of the literary woman was all alert.

“You did meet Charles Strickland, didn't you？”

Not only her face, but her whole body, gave a sense of alacrity. I nodded.I wondered if the poor devil had been hammered on the Stock Exchange or run over by an omnibus.

“Isn't it dreadful？He's run away from his wife.”

Miss Waterford certainly felt that she could not do her subject justice on the kerb of Jermyn Street, and so, like an artist, flung the bare fact at me and declared that she knew no details. I could not do her the injustice of supposing that so trifling a circumstance would have prevented her from giving them, but she was obstinate.

“I tell you I know nothing，”she said, in reply to my agitated questions, and then, with an airy shrug of the shoulders：“I believe that a young person in a city tea-shop has left her situation.”

She fashed a smile at me, and, protesting an engagement with her dentist, jauntily walked on. I was more interested than distressed.In those days my experience of life at frst hand was small, and it excited me to come upon an incident among people I knew of the same sort as I had read in books.I confess that time has now accustomed me to incidents of this character among my acquaintance.But I was also a little shocked.Strickland was certainly forty, and I thought it disgusting that a man of his age should concern himself with affairs of the heart.With the superciliousness of extreme youth, I put thirty-five as the utmost limit at which a man might fall in love without making a fool of himself.And this news was slightly disconcerting to me personally, because I had written from the country to Mrs.Strickland, announcing my return, and had added that unless I heard from her to the contrary, I would come on a certain day to drink a dish of tea with her.This was the very day, and I had received no word from Mrs.Strickland.Did she want to see me or did she not？It was likely enough that in the agitation of the moment my note had escaped her memory.Perhaps I should be wiser not to go.On the other hand, she might wish to keep the affair quiet, and it might be highly indiscreet on my part to give any sign that this strange news had reached me.I was torn between the fear of hurting a nice woman's feelings and the fear of being in the way.I felt she must be suffering, and I did not want to see a pain which I could not help；but in my heart was a desire, that I felt a little ashamed of, to see how she was taking it.I did not know what to do.

Finally it occurred to me that I would call as though nothing had happened, and send a message in by the maid asking Mrs. Strickland if it was convenient for her to see me.This would give her the opportunity to send me away.But I was overwhelmed with embarrassment when I said to the maid the phrase I had prepared, and while I waited for the answer in a dark passage I had to call up all my strength of mind not to bolt.The maid came back.Her manner suggested to my excited fancy a complete knowledge of the domestic calamity.

“Will you come this way, sir？”she said.

I followed her into the drawing-room. The blinds were partly drawn to darken the room, and Mrs.Strickland was sitting with her back to the light.Her brother-in-law, Colonel MacAndrew, stood in front of the freplace, warming his back at an unlit fre.To myself my entrance seemed excessively awkward.I imagined that my arrival had taken them by surprise, and Mrs.Strickland had let me come in only because she had forgotten to put me off.I fancied that the Colonel resented the interruption.

“I wasn't quite sure if you expected me，”I said, trying to seem unconcerned.

“Of course I did. Anne will bring the tea in a minute.”

Even in the darkened room, I could not help seeing that Mrs. Strickland's face was all swollen with tears.Her skin, never very good, was earthy.

“You remember my brother-in-law, don't you？You met at dinner here, just before the holidays.”

We shook hands. I felt so shy that I could think of nothing to say, but Mrs.Strickland came to my rescue.She asked me what I had been doing with myself during the summer, and with this help I managed to make some conversation till tea was brought in.The Colonel asked for a whisky-and-soda.

“You'd better have one too, Amy，”he said.

“No；I prefer tea.”

This was the frst suggestion that anything untoward had happened. I took no notice, and did my best to engage Mrs.Strickland in talk.The Colonel, still standing in front of the freplace, uttered no word.I wondered how soon I could decently take my leave, and I asked myself why on earth Mrs.Strickland had allowed me to come.There were no fowers, and various knick-knacks, put away during the summer, had not been replaced；there was something cheerless and stiff about the room which had always seemed so friendly；it gave you an odd feeling, as though someone were lying dead on the other side of the wall.I fnished tea.

“Will you have a cigarette？”asked Mrs. Strickland.

She looked about for the box, but it was not to be seen.

“I'm afraid there are none.”

Suddenly she burst into tears, and hurried from the room.

I was startled. I suppose now that the lack of cigarettes, brought as a rule by her husband, forced him back upon her recollection, and the new feeling that the small comforts she was used to were missing gave her a sudden pang.She realized that the old life was gone and done with.It was impossible to keep up our social pretences any longer.

“I dare say you'd like me to go，”I said to the Colonel, getting up.

“I suppose you've heard that blackguard has deserted her，”he cried explosively.

I hesitated.

“You know how people gossip，”I answered.“I was vaguely told that something was wrong.”

“He's bolted. He's gone off to Paris with a woman.He's left Amy without a penny.”

“I'm awfully sorry，”I said, not knowing what else to say.

The Colonel gulped down his whisky. He was a tall, lean man of ffty, with a drooping moustache and grey hair.He had pale blue eyes and a weak mouth.I remembered from my previous meeting with him that he had a foolish face, and was proud of the fact that for the ten years before he left the army he had played polo three days a week.

“I don't suppose Mrs. Strickland wants to be bothered with me just now，”I said.“Will you tell her how sorry I am？If there's anything I can do, I shall be delighted to do it.”

He took no notice of me.

“I don't know what's to become of her. And then there are the children.Are they going to live on air？Seventeen years.”

“What about seventeen years？”

“They've been married，”he snapped.“I never liked him. Of course he was my brother-in-law, and I made the best of it.Did you think him a gentleman？She ought never to have married him.”

“Is it absolutely fnal？”

“There's only one thing for her to do, and that's to divorce him. That's what I was telling her when you came in.‘Fire in with your petition, my dear Amy，'I said.‘You owe it to yourself and you owe it to the children.'He’d better not let me catch sight of him.I’d thrash him within an inch of his life.”

I could not help thinking that Colonel MacAndrew might have some difficulty in doing this, since Strickland had struck me as a hefty fellow, but I did not say anything. It is always distressing when outraged morality does not possess the strength of arm to administer direct chastisement on the sinner.I was making up my mind to another attempt at going when Mrs.Strickland came back.She had dried her eyes and powdered her nose.

“I'm sorry I broke down，”she said.“I'm glad you didn't go away.”

She sat down. I did not at all know what to say.I felt a certain shyness at referring to matters which were no concern of mine.I did not then know the besetting sin of woman, the passion to discuss her private affairs with anyone who is willing to listen.Mrs.Strickland seemed to make an effort over herself.

“Are people talking about it？”she asked.

I was taken aback by her assumption that I knew all about her domestic misfortune.

“I've only just come back. The only person I've seen is Rose Waterford.”

Mrs. Strickland clasped her hands.

“Tell me exactly what she said.”And when I hesitated, she insisted.“I particularly want to know.”

“You know the way people talk. She's not very reliable, is she？She said your husband had left you.”

“Is that all？”

I did not choose to repeat Rose Waterford's parting reference to a girl from a tea-shop. I lied.

“She didn't say anything about his going with anyone？”

“No.”

“That's all I wanted to know.”

I was a little puzzled, but at all events I understood that I might now take my leave. When I shook hands with Mrs.Strickland I told her that if I could be of any use to her I should be very glad.She smiled wanly.

“Thank you so much. I don't know that anybody can do anything for me.”

Too shy to express my sympathy, I turned to say good-bye to the Colonel. He did not take my hand.

“I'm just coming. If you're walking up Victoria Street, I'll come along with you.”

“All right，”I said.“Come on.”





Chapter IX


“This is a terrible thing，”he said, the moment we got out into the street.

I realized that he had come away with me in order to discuss once more what he had been already discussing for hours with his sister-in-law.

“We don't know who the woman is, you know，”he said.“All we know is that the blackguard's gone to Paris.”

“I thought they got on so well.”

“So they did. Why, just before you came in Amy said they'd never had a quarrel in the whole of their married life.You know Amy.There never was a better woman in the world.”

Since these confdences were thrust on me, I saw no harm in asking a few questions.

“But do you mean to say she suspected nothing？”

“Nothing. He spent August with her and the children in Norfolk.He was just the same as he'd always been.We went down for two or three days, my wife and I, and I played golf with him.He came back to town in September to let his partner go away, and Amy stayed on in the country.They'd taken a house for six weeks, and at the end of her tenancy she wrote to tell him on which day she was arriving in London.He answered from Paris.He said he'd made up his mind not to live with her any more.”

“What explanation did he give？”

“My dear fellow, he gave no explanation. I've seen the letter.It wasn't more than ten lines.”

“But that's extraordinary.”

We happened then to cross the street, and the traffc prevented us from speaking. What Colonel MacAndrew had told me seemed very improbable, and I suspected that Mrs.Strickland, for reasons of her own, had concealed from him some part of the facts.It was clear that a man after seventeen years of wedlock did not leave his wife without certain occurrences which must have led her to suspect that all was not well with their married life.The Colonel caught me up.

“Of course, there was no explanation he could give except that he'd gone off with a woman. I suppose he thought she could fnd that out for herself.That's the sort of chap he was.”

“What is Mrs. Strickland going to do？”

“Well, the frst thing is to get our proofs. I'm going over to Paris myself.”

“And what about his business？”

“That's where he's been so artful. He's been drawing in his horns for the last year.”

“Did he tell his partner he was leaving？”

“Not a word.”

Colonel MacAndrew had a very sketchy knowledge of business matters, and I had none at all, so I did not quite understand under what conditions Strickland had left his affairs. I gathered that the deserted partner was very angry and threatened proceedings.It appeared that when everything was settled he would be four or fve hundred pounds out of pocket.

“It's lucky the furniture in the fat is in Amy's name. She'll have that at all events.”

“Did you mean it when you said she wouldn't have a bob？”

“Of course I did. She's got two or three hundred pounds and the furniture.”

“But how is she going to live？”

“God knows.”

The affair seemed to grow more complicated, and the Colonel, with his expletives and his indignation, confused rather than informed me. I was glad that, catching sight of the clock at the Army and Navy Stores, he remembered an engagement to play cards at his club, and so left me to cut across St.James's Park.





Chapter X


A day or two later Mrs. Strickland sent me round a note asking if I could go and see her that evening after dinner.I found her alone.Her black dress, simple to austerity, suggested her bereaved condition, and I was innocently astonished that notwithstanding a real emotion she was able to dress the part she had to play according to her notions of seemliness.

“You said that if I wanted you to do anything you wouldn't mind doing it，”she remarked.

“It was quite true.”

“Will you go over to Paris and see Charlie？”

“I？”

I was taken aback. I refected that I had only seen him once.I did not know what she wanted me to do.

“Fred is set on going.”Fred was Colonel MacAndrew.“But I'm sure he's not the man to go. He'll only make things worse.I don't know who else to ask.”

Her voice trembled a little, and I felt a brute even to hesitate.

“But I've not spoken ten words to your husband. He doesn't know me.He'll probably just tell me to go to the devil.”

“That wouldn't hurt you，”said Mrs. Strickland, smiling.

“What is it exactly you want me to do？”

She did not answer directly.

“I think it's rather an advantage that he doesn't know you. You see, he never really liked Fred；he thought him a fool；he didn't understand soldiers.Fred would fly into a passion, and there'd be a quarrel, and things would be worse instead of better.If you said you came on my behalf, he couldn't refuse to listen to you.”

“I haven't known you very long，”I answered.“I don't see how anyone can be expected to tackle a case like this unless he knows all the details. I don't want to pry into what doesn't concern me.Why don't you go and see him yourself？”

“You forget he isn't alone.”

I held my tongue. I saw myself calling on Charles Strickland and sending in my card；I saw him come into the room, holding it between fnger and thumb：

“To what do I owe this honour？”

“I've come to see you about your wife.”

“Really. When you are a little older you will doubtless learn the advantage of minding your own business.If you will be so good as to turn your head slightly to the left, you will see the door.I wish you good afternoon.”

I foresaw that it would be diffcult to make my exit with dignity, and I wished to goodness that I had not returned to London till Mrs. Strickland had composed her diffculties.I stole a glance at her.She was immersed in thought.Presently she looked up at me, sighed deeply, and smiled.

“It was all so unexpected，”she said.“We'd been married seventeen years. I never dreamed that Charlie was the sort of man to get infatuated with anyone.We always got on very well together.Of course, I had a great many interests that he didn't share.”

“Have you found out who”-I did not quite know how to express myself-“who the person, who it is he's gone away with？”

“No. No one seems to have an idea.It's so strange.Generally when a man falls in love with someone people see them about together, lunching or something, and her friends always come and tell the wife.I had no warning-nothing.His letter came like a thunderbolt.I thought he was perfectly happy.”

She began to cry, poor thing, and I felt very sorry for her. But in a little while she grew calmer.

“It's no good making a fool of myself，”she said, drying her eyes.“The only thing is to decide what is the best thing to do.”

She went on, talking somewhat at random, now of the recent past, then of their frst meeting and their marriage；but presently I began to form a fairly coherent picture of their lives；and it seemed to me that my surmises had not been incorrect. Mrs.Strickland was the daughter of an Indian civilian, who on his retirement had settled in the depths of the country, but it was his habit every August to take his family to Eastbourne for change of air；and it was here, when she was twenty, that she met Charles Strickland.He was twenty-three.They played tennis together, walked on the front together, listened together to the nigger minstrels；and she made up her mind to accept him a week before he proposed to her.They lived in London, frst in Hampstead, and then, as he grew more prosperous, in town.Two children were born to them.

“He always seemed very fond of them. Even if he was tired of me, I wonder that he had the heart to leave them.It's all so incredible.Even now I can hardly believe it's true.”

At last she showed me the letter he had written. I was curious to see it, but had not ventured to ask for it.

My Dear Amy，

I think you will find everything all right in the flat. I have given Anne your instructions, and dinner will be ready for you and the children when you come.I shall not be there to meet you.I have made up my mind to live apart from you, and I am going to Paris in the morning.I shall post this letter on my arrival.I shall not come back.My decision is irrevocable.

Yours always，

Charles Strickland.

“Not a word of explanation or regret. Don't you think it's inhuman？”

“It's a very strange letter under the circumstances，”I replied.

“There's only one explanation, and that is that he's not himself. I don't know who this woman is who's got hold of him, but she's made him into another man.It’s evidently been going on a long time.”

“What makes you think that？”

“Fred found that out. My husband said he went to the club three or four nights a week to play bridge.Fred knows one of the members, and said something about Charles being a great bridge-player.The man was surprised.He said he'd never even seen Charles in the card-room.It's quite clear now that when I thought Charles was at his club he was with her.”

I was silent for a moment. Then I thought of the children.

“It must have been very diffcult to explain to Robert，”I said.

“Oh, I never said a word to either of them. You see, we only came up to town the day before they had to go back to school.I had the presence of mind to say that their father had been called away on business.”

It could not have been very easy to be bright and careless with that sudden secret in her heart, nor to give her attention to all the things that needed doing to get her children comfortably packed off. Mrs.Strickland's voice broke again.

“And what is to happen to them, poor darlings？How are we going to live？”

She struggled for self-control, and I saw her hands clench and unclench spasmodically. It was dreadfully painful.

“Of course I'll go over to Paris if you think I can do any good, but you must tell me exactly what you want me to do.”

“I want him to come back.”

“I understood from Colonel MacAndrew that you'd made up your mind to divorce him.”

“I'll never divorce him，”she answered with a sudden violence.“Tell him that from me. He'll never be able to marry that woman.I'm as obstinate as he is, and I'll never divorce him.I have to think of my children.”

I think she added this to explain her attitude to me, but I thought it was due to a very natural jealousy rather than to maternal solicitude.

“Are you in love with him still？”

“I don't know. I want him to come back.If he'll do that we'll let bygones be bygones.After all, we've been married for seventeen years.I'm a broad-minded woman.I wouldn’t have minded what he did as long as I knew nothing about it.He must know that his infatuation won’t last.If he’ll come back now everything can be smoothed over，and no one will know anything about it.”

It chilled me a little that Mrs. Strickland should be concerned with gossip, for I did not know then how great a part is played in women's life by the opinion of others.It throws a shadow of insincerity over their most deeply felt emotions.

It was known where Strickland was staying. His partner, in a violent letter, sent to his bank, had taunted him with hiding his whereabouts；and Strickland, in a cynical and humorous reply, had told his partner exactly where to fnd him.He was apparently living in an hotel.

“I've never heard of it，”said Mrs. Strickland.“But Fred knows it well.He says it's very expensive.”

She fushed darkly. I imagined that she saw her husband installed in a luxurious suite of rooms, dining at one smart restaurant after another, and she pictured his days spent at race-meetings and his evenings at the play.

“It can't go on at his age，”she said.“After all, he's forty. I could understand it in a young man, but I think it's horrible in a man of his years, with children who are nearly grown up.His health will never stand it.”

Anger struggled in her breast with misery.

“Tell him that our home cries out for him. Everything is just the same, and yet everything is different.I can't live without him.I'd sooner kill myself.Talk to him about the past, and all we've gone through together.What am I to say to the children when they ask for him？His room is exactly as it was when he left it.It's waiting for him.We're all waiting for him.”

Now she told me exactly what I should say. She gave me elaborate answers to every possible observation of his.

“You will do everything you can for me？”she said pitifully.“Tell him what a state I'm in.”

I saw that she wished me to appeal to his sympathies by every means in my power. She was weeping freely.I was extraordinarily touched.I felt indignant at Strickland's cold cruelty, and I promised to do all I could to bring him back.I agreed to go over on the next day but one, and to stay in Paris till I had achieved something.Then, as it was growing late and we were both exhausted by so much emotion, I left her.





Chapter XI


During the journey I thought over my errand with misgiving. Now that I was free from the spectacle of Mrs.Strickland's distress I could consider the matter more calmly.I was puzzled by the contradictions that I saw in her behaviour.She was very unhappy, but to excite my sympathy she was able to make a show of her unhappiness.It was evident that she had been prepared to weep, for she had provided herself with a suffciency of handkerchiefs；I admired her forethought, but in retrospect it made her tears perhaps less moving.I could not decide whether she desired the return of her husband because she loved him, or because she dreaded the tongue of scandal；and I was perturbed by the suspicion that the anguish of love contemned was alloyed in her broken heart with the pangs, sordid to my young mind, of wounded vanity.I had not yet learnt how contradictory is human nature；I did not know how much pose there is in the sincere, how much baseness in the noble, or how much goodness in the reprobate.

But there was something of an adventure in my trip, and my spirits rose as I approached Paris. I saw myself, too, from the dramatic standpoint, and I was pleased with my role of the trusted friend bringing back the errant husband to his forgiving wife.I made up my mind to see Strickland the following evening, for I felt instinctively that the hour must be chosen with delicacy.An appeal to the emotions is little likely to be effectual before luncheon.My own thoughts were then constantly occupied with love, but I never could imagine connubial bliss till after tea.

I inquired at my hotel for that in which Charles Strickland was living. It was called the H?tel des Belges.But the concierge, somewhat to my surprise, had never heard of it.I had understood from Mrs.Strickland that it was a large and sumptuous place at the back of the Rue de Rivoli.We looked it out in the directory.The only hotel of that name was in the Rue des Moines.The quarter was not fashionable；it was not even respectable.I shook my head.

“I'm sure that's not it，”I said.

The concierge shrugged his shoulders. There was no other hotel of that name in Paris.It occurred to me that Strickland had concealed his address, after all.In giving his partner the one I knew he was perhaps playing a trick on him.I do not know why I had an inkling that it would appeal to Strickland's sense of humour to bring a furious stockbroker over to Paris on a fool's errand to an ill-famed house in a mean street.Still, I thought I had better go and see.Next day about six o'clock I took a cab to the Rue des Moines, but dismissed it at the corner, since I preferred to walk to the hotel and look at it before I went in.It was a street of small shops subservient to the needs of poor people, and about the middle of it, on the left as I walked down, was the H?tel des Belges.My own hotel was modest enough, but it was magnificent in comparison with this.It was a tall, shabby building, that cannot have been painted for years, and it had so bedraggled an air that the houses on each side of it looked neat and clean.The dirty windows were all shut.It was not here that Charles Strickland lived in guilty splendour with the unknown charmer for whose sake he had abandoned honour and duty.I was vexed, for I felt that I had been made a fool of, and I nearly turned away without making an inquiry.I went in only to be able to tell Mrs.Strickland that I had done my best.

The door was at the side of a shop. It stood open, and just within was a sign：Bureau au premier.I walked up the narrow stairs, and on the landing found a sort of box, glassed in, within which were a desk and a couple of chairs.There was a bench outside, on which it might be presumed the night porter passed uneasy nights.There was no one about, but under an electric bell was written Gar?on.I rang, and presently a waiter appeared.He was a young man with furtive eyes and a sullen look.He was in shirt sleeves and carpet slippers.

I do not know why I made my inquiry as casual as possible.

“Does Mr. Strickland live here by any chance？”I asked.

“Number thirty-two. On the sixth foor.”

I was so surprised that for a moment I did not answer.

“Is he in？”

The waiter looked at a board in the bureau.

“He hasn't left his key. Go up and you'll see.”

I thought it as well to put one more question.

“Madame est là？”

“Monsieur est seul.”

The waiter looked at me suspiciously as I made my way upstairs. They were dark and airless.There was a foul and musty smell.Three flights up a woman in a dressing-gown, with touzled hair, opened a door and looked at me silently as I passed.At length I reached the sixth foor, and knocked at the door numbered thirty-two.There was a sound within, and the door was partly opened.Charles Strickland stood before me.He uttered not a word.He evidently did not know me.

I told him my name. I tried my best to assume an airy manner.

“You don't remember me. I had the pleasure of dining with you last July.”

“Come in，”he said cheerily.“I'm delighted to see you. Take a pew.”

I entered. It was a very small room, overcrowded with furniture of the style which the French know as Louis Philippe.There was a large wooden bedstead on which was a billowing red eiderdown, and there was a large wardrobe, a round table, a very small washstand, and two stuffed chairs covered with red rep.Everything was dirty and shabby.There was no sign of the abandoned luxury that Colonel MacAndrew had so confdently described.Strickland threw on the foor the clothes that burdened one of the chairs, and I sat down on it.

“What can I do for you？”he asked.

In that small room he seemed even bigger than I remembered him. He wore an old Norfolk jacket, and he had not shaved for several days.When last I saw him he was spruce enough, but he looked ill at ease：now, untidy and ill-kempt, he looked perfectly at home.I did not know how he would take the remark I had prepared.

“I've come to see you on behalf of your wife.”

“I was just going out to have a drink before dinner. You'd better come too.Do you like absinthe？”

“I can drink it.”

“Come on, then.”

He put on a bowler hat much in need of brushing.

“We might dine together. You owe me a dinner, you know.”

“Certainly. Are you alone？”

I flattered myself that I had got in that important question very naturally.

“Oh yes. In point of fact I've not spoken to a soul for three days.My French isn't exactly brilliant.”

I wondered as I preceded him downstairs what had happened to the little lady in the tea-shop. Had they quarrelled already, or was his infatuation passed？It seemed hardly likely if, as appeared, he had been taking steps for a year to make his desperate plunge.We walked to the Avenue de Clichy, and sat down at one of the tables on the pavement of a large café.





Chapter XII


The Avenue de Clichy was crowded at that hour, and a lively fancy might see in the passers-by the personages of many a sordid romance. There were clerks and shopgirls；old fellows who might have stepped out of the pages of Honoré de Balzac；members, male and female, of the professions which make their proft of the frailties of mankind.There is in the streets of the poorer quarters of Paris a thronging vitality which excites the blood and prepares the soul for the unexpected.

“Do you know Paris well？”I asked.

“No. We came on our honeymoon.I haven't been since.”

“How on earth did you fnd out your hotel？”

“It was recommended to me. I wanted something cheap.”

The absinthe came, and with due solemnity we dropped water over the melting sugar.

“I thought I'd better tell you at once why I had come to see you，”I said, not without embarrassment.

His eyes twinkled.

“I thought somebody would come along sooner or later. I've had a lot of letters from Amy.”

“Then you know pretty well what I've got to say.”

“I've not read them.”

I lit a cigarette to give myself a moment's time. I did not quite know now how to set about my mission.The eloquent phrases I had arranged, pathetic or indignant, seemed out of place on the Avenue de Clichy.Suddenly he gave a chuckle.

“Beastly job for you this, isn't it？”

“Oh, I don't know，”I answered.

“Well, look here, you get it over, and then we'll have a jolly evening.”

I hesitated.

“Has it occurred to you that your wife is frightfully unhappy？”

“She'll get over it.”

I cannot describe the extraordinary callousness with which he made this reply. It disconcerted me, but I did my best not to show it.I adopted the tone used by my Uncle Henry, a clergyman, when he was asking one of his relatives for a subscription to the Additional Curates Society.

“You don't mind my talking to you frankly？”

He shook his head, smiling.

“Has she deserved that you should treat her like this？”

“No.”

“Have you any complaint to make against her？”

“None.”

“Then, isn't it monstrous to leave her in this fashion, after seventeen years of married life, without a fault to fnd with her？”

“Monstrous.”

I glanced at him with surprise. His cordial agreement with all I said cut the ground from under my feet.It made my position complicated, not to say ludicrous.I was prepared to be persuasive, touching, and hortatory, admonitory and expostulating, if need be vituperative even， indignant and sarcastic；but what the devil does a mentor do when the sinner makes no bones about confessing his sin？I had no experience, since my own practice has always been to deny everything.

“What, then？”asked Strickland.

I tried to curl my lip.

“Well, if you acknowledge that, there doesn't seem much more to be said.”

“I don't think there is.”

I felt that I was not carrying out my embassy with any great skill. I was distinctly nettled.

“Hang it all, one can't leave a woman without a bob.”

“Why not？”

“How is she going to live？”

“I've supported her for seventeen years. Why shouldn't she support herself for a change？”

“She can't.”

“Let her try.”

Of course there were many things I might have answered to this. I might have spoken of the economic position of woman, of the contract, tacit and overt, which a man accepts by his marriage, and of much else；but I felt that there was only one point which really signifed.

“Don't you care for her any more？”

“Not a bit，”he replied.

The matter was immensely serious for all the parties concerned, but there was in the manner of his answers such a cheerful effrontery that I had to bite my lips in order not to laugh. I reminded myself that his behaviour was abominable.I worked myself up into a state of moral indignation.

“Damn it all, there are your children to think of. They've never done you any harm.They didn't ask to be brought into the world.If you chuck everything like this, they'll be thrown on the streets.'

“They've had a good many years of comfort. It's much more than the majority of children have.Besides, somebody will look after them.When it comes to the point, the MacAndrews will pay for their schooling.”

“But aren't you fond of them？They're such awfully nice kids. Do you mean to say you don't want to have anything more to do with them？”

“I liked them all right when they were kids, but now they're growing up I haven't got any particular feeling for them.”

“It's just inhuman.”

“I dare say.”

“You don't seem in the least ashamed.”

“I'm not.”

I tried another tack.

“Everyone will think you a perfect swine.”

“Let them.”

“Won't it mean anything to you to know that people loathe and despise you？”

“No.”

His brief answer was so scornful that it made my question, natural though it was, seem absurd. I refected for a minute or two.

“I wonder if one can live quite comfortably when one's conscious of the disapproval of one's fellows？Are you sure it won't begin to worry you？Everyone has some sort of a conscience, and sooner or later it will fnd you out. Supposing your wife died, wouldn't you be tortured by remorse？”

He did not answer, and I waited for some time for him to speak. At last I had to break the silence myself.

“What have you to say to that？”

“Only that you're a damned fool.”

“At all events, you can be forced to support your wife and children，”I retorted, somewhat piqued.“I suppose the law has some protection to offer them.”

“Can the law get blood out of a stone？I haven't any money. I've got about a hundred pounds.”

I began to be more puzzled than before. It was true that his hotel pointed to the most straitened circumstances.

“What are you going to do when you've spent that？”

“Earn some.”

He was perfectly cool, and his eyes kept that mocking smile which made all I said seem rather foolish. I paused for a little while to consider what I had better say next.But it was he who spoke frst.

“Why doesn't Amy marry again？She's comparatively young, and she's not unattractive. I can recommend her as an excellent wife.If she wants to divorce me I don't mind giving her the necessary grounds.”

Now it was my turn to smile. He was very cunning, but it was evidently this that he was aiming at.He had some reason to conceal the fact that he had run away with a woman, and he was using every precaution to hide her whereabouts.I answered with decision.

“Your wife says that nothing you can do will ever induce her to divorce you. She's quite made up her mind.You can put any possibility of that defnitely out of your head.”

He looked at me with astonishment that was certainly not feigned.The smile abandoned his lips, and he spoke quite seriously.

“But, my dear fellow, I don't care. It doesn't matter a twopenny damn to me one way or the other.”

I laughed.

“Oh, come now；you mustn't think us such fools as all that. We happen to know that you came away with a woman.”

He gave a little start, and then suddenly burst into a shout of laughter. He laughed so uproariously that the people sitting near us looked round, and some of them began to laugh too.

“I don't see anything very amusing in that.”

“Poor Amy，”he grinned.

Then his face grew bitterly scornful.

“What poor minds women have got！Love. It's always love.They think a man leaves them only because he wants others.Do you think I should be such a fool as to do what I've done for a woman？”

“Do you mean to say you didn't leave your wife for another woman？”

“Of course not.”

“On your word of honour？”

I don't know why I asked for that. It was very ingenuous of me.

“On my word of honour.”

“Then, what in God's name have you left her for？”

“I want to paint.”

I looked at him for quite a long time. I did not understand.I thought he was mad.It must be remembered that I was very young, and I looked upon him as a middle-aged man.I forgot everything but my own amazement.

“But you're forty.”

“That's what made me think it was high time to begin.”

“Have you ever painted？”

“I rather wanted to be a painter when I was a boy, but my father made me go into business because he said there was no money in art. I began to paint a bit a year ago.For the last year I've been going to some classes at night.”

“Was that where you went when Mrs. Strickland thought you were playing bridge at your club？”

“That's it.”

“Why didn't you tell her？”

“I preferred to keep it to myself.”

“Can you paint？”

“Not yet. But I shall.That's why I've come over here.I couldn't get what I wanted in London.Perhaps I can here.”

“Do you think it's likely that a man will do any good when he starts at your age？Most men begin painting at eighteen.”

“I can learn quicker than I could when I was eighteen.”

“What makes you think you have any talent？”

He did not answer for a minute. His gaze rested on the passing throng, but I do not think he saw it.His answer was no answer.

“I've got to paint.”

“Aren't you taking an awful chance？”

He looked at me then. His eyes had something strange in them, so that I felt rather uncomfortable.

“How old are you？Twenty-three？”

It seemed to me that the question was beside the point. It was natural that I should take chances；but he was a man whose youth was past, a stockbroker with a position of respectability, a wife and two children.A course that would have been natural for me was absurd for him.I wished to be quite fair.

“Of course a miracle may happen, and you may be a great painter, but you must confess the chances are a million to one against it. It'll be an awful sell if at the end you have to acknowledge you've made a hash of it.”

“I've got to paint，”he repeated.

“Supposing you're never anything more than third-rate, do you think it will have been worth while to give up everything？After all, in any other walk in life it doesn't matter if you're not very good；you can get along quite comfortably if you're just adequate；but it's different with an artist.”

“You blasted fool，”he said.

“I don't see why, unless it's folly to say the obvious.”

“I tell you I've got to paint. I can't help myself.When a man falls into the water it doesn't matter how he swims, well or badly：he's got to get out or else he'll drown.”

There was real passion in his voice, and in spite of myself I was impressed. I seemed to feel in him some vehement power that was struggling within him；it gave me the sensation of something very strong, overmastering, that held him, as it were, against his will.I could not understand.He seemed really to be possessed of a devil, and I felt that it might suddenly turn and rend him.Yet he looked ordinary enough.My eyes, resting on him curiously, caused him no embarrassment.I wondered what a stranger would have taken him to be, sitting there in his old Norfolk jacket and his unbrushed bowler；his trousers were baggy, his hands were not clean；and his face, with the red stubble of the unshaved chin, the little eyes, and the large, aggressive nose, was uncouth and coarse.His mouth was large, his lips were heavy and sensual.No；I could not have placed him.

“You won't go back to your wife？”I said at last.

“Never.”

“She's willing to forget everything that's happened and start afresh. She'll never make you a single reproach.”

“She can go to hell.”

“You don't care if people think you an utter blackguard？You don't care if she and your children have to beg their bread？”

“Not a damn.”

I was silent for a moment in order to give greater force to my next remark. I spoke as deliberately as I could.

“You are a most unmitigated cad.”

“Now that you've got that off your chest, let's go and have dinner.”





Chapter XIII


I dare say it would have been more seemly to decline this proposal. I think perhaps I should have made a show of the indignation I really felt, and I am sure that Colonel MacAndrew at least would have thought well of me if I had been able to report my stout refusal to sit at the same table with a man of such character.But the fear of not being able to carry it through effectively has always made me shy of assuming the moral attitude；and in this case the certainty that my sentiments would be lost on Strickland made it peculiarly embarrassing to utter them.Only the poet or the saint can water an asphalt pavement in the confdent anticipation that lilies will reward his labour.

I paid for what we had drunk, and we made our way to a cheap restaurant, crowded and gay, where we dined with pleasure. I had the appetite of youth and he of a hardened conscience.Then we went to a tavern to have coffee and liqueurs.

I had said all I had to say on the subject that had brought me to Paris, and though I felt it in a manner treacherous to Mrs. Strickland not to pursue it, I could not struggle against his indifference.It requires the feminine temperament to repeat the same thing three times with unabated zest.I solaced myself by thinking that it would be useful for me to fnd out what I could about Strickland's state of mind.It also interested me much more.But this was not an easy thing to do, for Strickland was not a fuent talker.He seemed to express himself with diffculty, as though words were not the medium with which his mind worked；and you had to guess the intentions of his soul by hackneyed phrases, slang, and vague, unfinished gestures.But though he said nothing of any consequence, there was something in his personality which prevented him from being dull.Perhaps it was sincerity.He did not seem to care much about the Paris he was now seeing for the frst time（I did not count the visit with his wife），and he accepted sights which must have been strange to him without any sense of astonishment.I have been to Paris a hundred times, and it never fails to give me a thrill of excitement；I can never walk its streets without feeling myself on the verge of adventure.Strickland remained placid.Looking back, I think now that he was blind to everything but to some disturbing vision in his soul.

One rather absurd incident took place. There were a number of harlots in the tavern：some were sitting with men, others by themselves；and presently I noticed that one of these was looking at us.When she caught Strickland's eye she smiled.I do not think he saw her.In a little while she went out, but in a minute returned and, passing our table, very politely asked us to buy her something to drink.She sat down and I began to chat with her；but, it was plain that her interest was in Strickland.I explained that he knew no more than two words of French.She tried to talk to him, partly by signs, partly in pidgin French, which, for some reason, she thought would be more comprehensible to him, and she had half a dozen phrases of English.She made me translate what she could only express in her own tongue, and eagerly asked for the meaning of his replies.He was quite good-tempered, a little amused, but his indifference was obvious.

“I think you've made a conquest，”I laughed.

“I'm not fattered.”

In his place I should have been more embarrassed and less calm. She had laughing eyes and a most charming mouth.She was young.I wondered what she found so attractive in Strickland.She made no secret of her desires, and I was bidden to translate.

“She wants you to go home with her.”

“I'm not taking any，”he replied.

I put his answer as pleasantly as I could. It seemed to me a little ungracious to decline an invitation of that sort, and I ascribed his refusal to lack of money.

“But I like him，”she said.“Tell him it's for love.”

When I translated this, Strickland shrugged his shoulders impatiently.

“Tell her to go to hell，”he said.

His manner made his answer quite plain, and the girl threw back her head with a sudden gesture. Perhaps she reddened under her paint.She rose to her feet.

“Monsieur n'est pas poli，”she said.

She walked out of the inn. I was slightly vexed.

“There wasn't any need to insult her that I can see，”I said.“After all, it was rather a compliment she was paying you.”

“That sort of thing makes me sick，”he said roughly.

I looked at him curiously. There was a real distaste in his face, and yet it was the face of a coarse and sensual man.I suppose the girl had been attracted by a certain brutality in it.

“I could have got all the women I wanted in London. I didn't come here for that.”





Chapter XIV


During the journey back to England I thought much of Strickland. I tried to set in order what I had to tell his wife.It was unsatisfactory, and I could not imagine that she would be content with me；I was not content with myself.Strickland perplexed me.I could not understand his motives.When I had asked him what frst gave him the idea of being a painter, he was unable or unwilling to tell me.I could make nothing of it.I tried to persuade myself than an obscure feeling of revolt had been gradually coming to a head in his slow mind, but to challenge this was the undoubted fact that he had never shown any impatience with the monotony of his life.If, seized by an intolerable boredom, he had determined to be a painter merely to break with irksome ties, it would have been comprehensible, and commonplace；but commonplace is precisely what I felt he was not.At last, because I was romantic, I devised an explanation which I acknowledged to be far-fetched, but which was the only one that in any way satisfed me.It was this：I asked myself whether there was not in his soul some deep-rooted instinct of creation, which the circumstances of his life had obscured, but which grew relentlessly, as a cancer may grow in the living tissues, till at last it took possession of his whole being and forced him irresistibly to action.The cuckoo lays its egg in the strange bird's nest, and when the young one is hatched it shoulders its foster-brothers out and breaks at last the nest that has sheltered it.

But how strange it was that the creative instinct should seize upon this dull stockbroker, to his own ruin, perhaps, and to the misfortune of such as were dependent on him；and yet no stranger than the way in which the spirit of God has seized men, powerful and rich, pursuing them with stubborn vigilance till at last, conquered, they have abandoned the joy of the world and the love of women for the painful austerities of the cloister. Conversion may come under many shapes, and it may be brought about in many ways.With some men it needs a cataclysm, as a stone may be broken to fragments by the fury of a torrent；but with some it comes gradually, as a stone may be worn away by the ceaseless fall of a drop of water.Strickland had the directness of the fanatic and the ferocity of the apostle.

But to my practical mind it remained to be seen whether the passion which obsessed him would be justified of its works. When I asked him what his brother-students at the night classes he had attended in London thought of his painting, he answered with a grin：

“They thought it a joke.”

“Have you begun to go to a studio here？”

“Yes. The blighter came round this morning-the master, you know；when he saw my drawing he just raised his eyebrows and walked on.”

Strickland chuckled. He did not seem discouraged.He was independent of the opinion of his fellows.

And it was just that which had most disconcerted me in my dealings with him. When people say they do not care what others think of them, for the most part they deceive themselves.Generally they mean only that they will do as they choose, in the confdence that no one will know their vagaries；and at the utmost only that they are willing to act contrary to the opinion of the majority because they are supported by the approval of their neighbours.It is not diffcult to be unconventional in the eyes of the world when your unconventionality is but the convention of your set.It affords you then an inordinate amount of self-esteem.You have the self-satisfaction of courage without the inconvenience of danger.But the desire for approbation is perhaps the most deeply seated instinct of civilized man.No one runs so hurriedly to the cover of respectability as the unconventional woman who has exposed herself to the slings and arrows of outraged propriety.I do not believe the people who tell me they do not care a row of pins for the opinion of their fellows.It is the bravado of ignorance.They mean only that they do not fear reproaches for peccadilloes which they are convinced none will discover.

But here was a man who sincerely did not mind what people thought of him, and so convention had no hold on him；he was like a wrestler whose body is oiled；you could not get a grip on him；it gave him a freedom which was an outrage. I remember saying to him：

“Look here, if everyone acted like you, the world couldn't go on.”

“That's a damned silly thing to say. Everyone doesn't want to act like me.The great majority are perfectly content to do the ordinary thing.”

And once I sought to be satirical.

“You evidently don't believe in the maxim：Act so that every one of your actions is capable of being made into a universal rule.”

“I never heard it before, but it's rotten nonsense.”

“Well, it was Kant who said it.”

“I don't care；it's rotten nonsense.”

Nor with such a man could you expect the appeal to conscience to be effective. You might as well ask for a refection without a mirror.I take it that conscience is the guardian in the individual of the rules which the community has evolved for its own preservation.It is the policeman in all our hearts, set there to watch that we do not break its laws.It is the spy seated in the central stronghold of the ego.Man's desire for the approval of his fellows is so strong, his dread of their censure so violent, that he himself has brought his enemy within his gates；and it keeps watch over him, vigilant always in the interests of its master to crush any half-formed desire to break away from the herd.It will force him to place the good of society before his own.It is the very strong link that attaches the individual to the whole.And man, subservient to interests he has persuaded himself are greater than his own, makes himself a slave to his taskmaster.He sits him in a seat of honour.At last, like a courtier fawning on the royal stick that is laid about his shoulders, he prides himself on the sensitiveness of his conscience.Then he has no words hard enough for the man who does not recognize its sway；for, a member of society now, he realises accurately enough that against him he is powerless.When I saw that Strickland was really indifferent to the blame his conduct must excite, I could only draw back in horror as from a monster of hardly human shape.

The last words he said to me when I bade him good-night were：

“Tell Amy it's no good coming after me. Anyhow, I shall change my hotel, so she wouldn't be able to fnd me.”

“My own impression is that she's well rid of you，”I said.

“My dear fellow, I only hope you'll be able to make her see it. But women are very unintelligent.”





Chapter XV


When I reached London I found waiting for me an urgent request that I should go to Mrs. Strickland's as soon after dinner as I could.I found her with Colonel MacAndrew and his wife.Mrs.Strickland's sister was older than she, not unlike her, but more faded；and she had the effcient air, as though she carried the British Empire in her pocket, which the wives of senior officers acquire from the consciousness of belonging to a superior caste.Her manner was brisk, and her good-breeding scarcely concealed her conviction that if you were not a soldier you might as well be a counter-jumper.She hated the Guards, whom she thought conceited, and she could not trust herself to speak of their ladies, who were so remiss in calling.Her gown was dowdy and expensive.

Mrs. Strickland was plainly nervous.

“Well, tell us your news，”she said.

“I saw your husband. I'm afraid he's quite made up his mind not to return.”I paused a little.“He wants to paint.”

“What do you mean？”cried Mrs. Strickland, with the utmost astonishment.

“Did you never know that he was keen on that sort of thing？”

“He must be as mad as a hatter，”exclaimed the Colonel.

Mrs. Strickland frowned a little.She was searching among her recollections.

“I remember before we were married he used to potter about with a paint-box. But you never saw such daubs.We used to chaff him.He had absolutely no gift for anything like that.”

“Of course, it's only an excuse，”said Mrs. MacAndrew.

Mrs. Strickland pondered deeply for some time.It was quite clear that she could not make head or tail of my announcement.She had put some order into the drawing-room by now, her housewifely instincts having got the better of her dismay；and it no longer bore that deserted look, like a furnished house long to let, which I had noticed on my frst visit after the catastrophe.But now that I had seen Strickland in Paris it was diffcult to imagine him in those surroundings.I thought it could hardly have failed to strike them that there was something incongruous in him.

“But if he wanted to be an artist, why didn't he say so？”asked Mrs. Strickland at last.“I should have thought I was the last person to be unsympathetic to-to aspiration of that kind.”

Mrs. MacAndrew tightened her lips.I imagine that she had never looked with approval on her sister's leaning towards persons who cultivated the arts.She spoke of“culchaw”derisively.

Mrs. Strickland continued：

“After all, if he had any talent I should be the first to encourage it. I wouldn't have minded sacrifces.I'd much rather be married to a painter than to a stockbroker.If it weren't for the children, I wouldn't mind anything.I could be just as happy in a shabby studio in Chelsea as in this fat.”

“My dear, I have no patience with you，”cried Mrs. MacAndrew.“You don't mean to say you believe a word of this nonsense？”

“But I think it's true，”I put in mildly.

She looked at me with good-humoured contempt.

“A man doesn't throw up his business and leave his wife and children at the age of forty to become a painter unless there's a woman in it. I suppose he met one of your-artistic friends, and she's turned his head.”

A spot of colour rose suddenly to Mrs. Strickland's pale cheeks.

“What is she like？”

I hesitated a little. I knew that I had a bombshell.

“There isn't a woman.”

Colonel MacAndrew and his wife uttered expressions of incredulity, and Mrs. Strickland sprang to her feet.

“Do you mean to say you never saw her？”

“There's no one to see. He's quite alone.”

“That's preposterous，”cried Mrs. MacAndrew.

“I knew I ought to have gone over myself，”said the Colonel.“You can bet your boots I'd have routed her out fast enough.”

“I wish you had gone over，”I replied, somewhat tartly.“You'd have seen that every one of your suppositions was wrong. He's not at a smart hotel.He's living in one tiny room in the most squalid way.If he's left his home, it's not to live a gay life.He’s got hardly any money.”

“Do you think he's done something that we don't know about, and is lying doggo on account of the police？”

The suggestion sent a ray of hope in all their breasts, but I would have nothing to do with it.

“If that were so, he would hardly have been such a fool as to give his partner his address，”I retorted acidly.“Anyhow, there's one thing I'm positive of, he didn't go away with anyone. He's not in love.Nothing is farther from his thoughts.”

There was a pause while they refected over my words.

“Well, if what you say is true，”said Mrs. MacAndrew at last，“things aren't so bad as I thought.”

Mrs. Strickland glanced at her, but said nothing.She was very pale now, and her fne brow was dark and lowering.I could not understand the expression of her face.Mrs.MacAndrew continued：

“If it's just a whim, he'll get over it.”

“Why don't you go over to him, Amy？”hazarded the Colonel.“There's no reason why you shouldn't live with him in Paris for a year. We'll look after the children.I dare say he'd got stale.Sooner or later he’ll be quite ready to come back to London, and no great harm will have been done.”

“I wouldn't do that，”said Mrs. MacAndrew.“I'd give him all the rope he wants.He'll come back with his tail between his legs and settle down again quite comfortably.”Mrs.MacAndrew looked at her sister coolly.“Perhaps you weren't very wise with him sometimes.Men are queer creatures, and one has to know how to manage them.”

Mrs. MacAndrew shared the common opinion of her sex that a man is always a brute to leave a woman who is attached to him, but that a woman is much to blame if he does.Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point.

Mrs. Strickland looked slowly from one to another of us.

“He'll never come back，”she said.

“Oh, my dear, remember what we've just heard. He's been used to comfort and to having someone to look after him.How long do you think it'll be before he gets tired of a scrubby room in a scrubby hotel？ Besides, he hasn't any money.He must come back.”

“As long as I thought he'd run away with some woman I thought there was a chance. I don't believe that sort of thing ever answers.He'd have got sick to death of her in three months.But if he hasn't gone because he's in love, then it’s fnished.”

“Oh, I think that's awfully subtle，”said the Colonel, putting into the word all the contempt he felt for a quality so alien to the traditions of his calling.“Don't you believe it. He'll come back, and, as Dorothy says, I dare say he'll be none the worse for having had a bit of a fing.”

“But I don't want him back，”she said.

“Amy！”

It was anger that had seized Mrs. Strickland, and her pallor was the pallor of a cold and sudden rage.She spoke quickly now, with little gasps.

“I could have forgiven it if he'd fallen desperately in love with someone and gone off with her. I should have thought that natural.I shouldn't really have blamed him.I should have thought he was led away.Men are so weak, and women are so unscrupulous.But this is different.I hate him.I'll never forgive him now.”

Colonel MacAndrew and his wife began to talk to her together. They were astonished.They told her she was mad.They could not understand.Mrs.Strickland turned desperately to me.

“Don't you see？”she cried.

“I'm not sure. Do you mean that you could have forgiven him if he'd left you for a woman, but not if he's left you for an idea？You think you're a match for the one, but against the other you're helpless？”

Mrs. Strickland gave me a look in which I read no great friendliness, but did not answer.Perhaps I had struck home.She went on in a low and trembling voice：

“I never knew it was possible to hate anyone as much as I hate him. Do you know, I've been comforting myself by thinking that however long it lasted he'd want me at the end.I knew when he was dying he'd send for me, and I was ready to go；I'd have nursed him like a mother, and at the last I'd have told him that it didn’t matter, I’d loved him always, and I forgave him everything.”

I have always been a little disconcerted by the passion women have for behaving beautifully at the death-bed of those they love. Sometimes it seems as if they grudge the longevity which postpones their chance of an effective scene.

“But now-now it's fnished. I'm as indifferent to him as if he were a stranger.I should like him to die miserable, poor, and starving, without a friend.I hope he'll rot with some loathsome disease.I've done with him.”

I thought it as well then to say what Strickland had suggested.

“If you want to divorce him, he's quite willing to do whatever is necessary to make it possible.”

“Why should I give him his freedom？”

“I don't think he wants it. He merely thought it might be more convenient to you.”

Mrs. Strickland shrugged her shoulders impatiently.I think I was a little disappointed in her.I expected then people to be more of a piece than I do now, and I was distressed to fnd so much vindictiveness in so charming a creature.I did not realize how motley are the qualities that go to make up a human being.Now I am well aware that pettiness and grandeur, malice and charity, hatred and love, can find place side by side in the same human heart.

I wondered if there was anything I could say that would ease the sense of bitter humiliation which at present tormented Mrs. Strickland.I thought I would try.

“You know, I'm not sure that your husband is quite responsible for his actions. I do not think he is himself.He seems to me to be possessed by some power which is using him for its own ends, and in whose hold he is as helpless as a fy in a spider's web.It's as though someone had cast a spell over him.I'm reminded of those strange stories one sometimes hears of another personality entering into a man and driving out the old one.The soul lives unstably in the body, and is capable of mysterious transformations.In the old days they would say Charles Strickland had a devil.”

Mrs. MacAndrew smoothed down the lap of her gown, and gold bangles fell over her wrists.

“All that seems to me very far-fetched，”she said acidly.“I don't deny that perhaps Amy took her husband a little too much for granted. If she hadn't been so busy with her own affairs, I can't believe that she wouldn't have suspected something was the matter.I don't think that Alec could have something on his mind for a year or more without my having a pretty shrewd idea of it.”

The Colonel stared into vacancy, and I wondered whether anyone could be quite so innocent of guile as he looked.

“But that doesn't prevent the fact that Charles Strickland is a heartless beast.”She looked at me severely.“I can tell you why he left his wife-from pure selfshness and nothing else whatever.”

“That is certainly the simplest explanation，”I said. But I thought it explained nothing.When, saying I was tired, I rose to go, Mrs.Strickland made no attempt to detain me.





Chapter XVI


What followed showed that Mrs. Strickland was a woman of character.Whatever anguish she suffered she concealed.She saw shrewdly that the world is quickly bored by the recital of misfortune, and willingly avoids the sight of distress.Whenever she went out-and compassion for her misadventure made her friends eager to entertain her-she bore a demeanour that was perfect.She was brave, but not too obviously；cheerful, but not brazenly；and she seemed more anxious to listen to the troubles of others than to discuss her own.Whenever she spoke of her husband it was with pity.Her attitude towards him at frst perplexed me.One day she said to me：

“You know, I'm convinced you were mistaken about Charles being alone. From what I've been able to gather from certain sources that I can't tell you, I know that he didn't leave England by himself.”

“In that case he has a positive genius for covering up his tracks.”

She looked away and slightly coloured.

“What I mean is, if anyone talks to you about it, please don't contradict it if they say he eloped with somebody.”

“Of course not.”

She changed the conversation as though it were a matter to which she attached no importance. I discovered presently that a peculiar story was circulating among her friends.They said that Charles Strickland had become infatuated with a French dancer, whom he had frst seen in the ballet at the Empire, and had accompanied her to Paris.I could not find out how this had arisen, but, singularly enough, it created much sympathy for Mrs.Strickland, and at the same time gave her not a little prestige.This was not without its use in the calling which she had decided to follow.Colonel MacAndrew had not exaggerated when he said she would be penniless, and it was necessary for her to earn her living as quickly as she could.She made up her mind to proft by her acquaintance with so many writers, and without loss of time began to learn shorthand and typewriting.Her education made it likely that she would be a typist more effcient than the average, and her story made her claims appealing.Her friends promised to send her work, and took care to recommend her to all theirs.

The MacAndrews, who were childless and in easy circumstances, arranged to undertake the care of the children, and Mrs. Strickland had only herself to provide for.She let her fat and sold her furniture.She settled in two tiny rooms in Westminster, and faced the world anew.She was so effcient that it was certain she would make a success of the adventure.





Chapter XVII


It was about five years after this that I decided to live in Paris for a while. I was growing stale in London.I was tired of doing much the same thing every day.My friends pursued their course with uneventfulness；they had no longer any surprises for me, and when I met them I knew pretty well what they would say；even their love-affairs had a tedious banality.We were like tram-cars running on their lines from terminus to terminus, and it was possible to calculate within small limits the number of passengers they would carry.Life was ordered too pleasantly.I was seized with panic.I gave up my small apartment, sold my few belongings, and resolved to start afresh.

I called on Mrs. Strickland before I left.I had not seen her for some time, and I noticed changes in her；it was not only that she was older, thinner, and more lined；I think her character had altered.She had made a success of her business, and now had an offce in Chancery Lane；she did little typing herself, but spent her time correcting the work of the four girls she employed.She had had the idea of giving it a certain daintiness, and she made much use of blue and red inks；she bound the copy in coarse paper, that looked vaguely like watered silk, in various pale colours；and she had acquired a reputation for neatness and accuracy.She was making money.But she could not get over the idea that to earn her living was somewhat undignified, and she was inclined to remind you that she was a lady by birth.She could not help bringing into her conversation the names of people she knew which would satisfy you that she had not sunk in the social scale.She was a little ashamed of her courage and business capacity, but delighted that she was going to dine the next night with a K.C.who lived in South Kensington.She was pleased to be able to tell you that her son was at Cambridge, and it was with a little laugh that she spoke of the rush of dances to which her daughter, just out, was invited.I suppose I said a very stupid thing.

“Is she going into your business？”I asked.

“Oh no；I wouldn't let her do that，”Mrs. Strickland answered.“She's so pretty.I'm sure she'll marry well.”

“I should have thought it would be a help to you.”

“Several people have suggested that she should go on the stage, but of course I couldn't consent to that. I know all the chief dramatists, and I could get her a part tomorrow, but I shouldn't like her to mix with all sorts of people.”

I was a little chilled by Mrs. Strickland's exclusiveness.

“Do you ever hear of your husband？”

“No；I haven't heard a word. He may be dead for all I know.”

“I may run across him in Paris. Would you like me to let you know about him？”

She hesitated a minute.

“If he's in any real want I'm prepared to help him a little. I'd send you a certain sum of money, and you could give it him gradually, as he needed it.”

“That's very good of you，”I said.

But I knew it was not kindness that prompted the offer. It is not true that suffering ennobles the character；happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.





Chapter XVIII


In point of fact, I met Strickland before I had been a fortnight in Paris.

I quickly found myself a tiny apartment on the ffth foor of a house in the Rue des Dames, and for a couple of hundred francs bought at a second-hand dealer's enough furniture to make it habitable. I arranged with the concierge to make my coffee in the morning and to keep the place clean.Then I went to see my friend Dirk Stroeve.

Dirk Stroeve was one of those persons whom, according to your character, you cannot think of without derisive laughter or an embarrassed shrug of the shoulders. Nature had made him a buffoon.He was a painter, but a very bad one, whom I had met in Rome, and I still remembered his pictures.He had a genuine enthusiasm for the commonplace.His soul palpitating with love of art, he painted the models who hung about the stairway of Bernini in the Piazza di Spagna, undaunted by their obvious picturesqueness；and his studio was full of canvases on which were portrayed moustachioed, large-eyed peasants in peaked hats, urchins in becoming rags, and women in bright petticoats.Sometimes they lounged at the steps of a church, and sometimes dallied among cypresses against a cloudless sky；sometimes they made love by a Renaissance well-head, and sometimes they wandered through the Campagna by the side of an ox-wagon.They were carefully drawn and carefully painted.A photograph could not have been more exact.One of the painters at the Villa Medici had called him Le Ma?tre de la Bo?te à Chocolats.To look at his pictures you would have thought that Monet, Manet, and the rest of the Impressionists had never been.

“I don't pretend to be a great painter，”he said.“I'm not a Michael Angelo, no, but I have something. I sell.I bring romance into the homes of all sorts of people.Do you know, they buy my pictures not only in Holland, but in Norway and Sweden and Denmark？It's mostly merchants who buy them, and rich tradesmen.You can't imagine what the winters are like in those countries, so long and dark and cold.They like to think that Italy is like my pictures.That's what they expect.That’s what I expected Italy to be before I came here.”

And I think that was the vision that had remained with him always, dazzling his eyes so that he could not see the truth；and notwithstanding the brutality of fact, he continued to see with the eyes of the spirit an Italy of romantic brigands and picturesque ruins. It was an ideal that he painted-a poor one, common and shop-soiled, but still it was an ideal；and it gave his character a defnite charm.

It was because I felt this that Dirk Stroeve was not to me, as to others, merely an object of ridicule. His fellow-painters made no secret of their contempt for his work, but he earned a fair amount of money, and they did not hesitate to make free use of his purse.He was generous, and the needy, laughing at him because he believed so na?vely their stories of distress, borrowed from him with effrontery.He was very emotional, yet his feeling, so easily aroused, had in it something absurd, so that you accepted his kindness, but felt no gratitude.To take money from him was like robbing a child, and you despised him because he was so foolish.I imagine that a pickpocket, proud of his light fingers, must feel a sort of indignation with the careless woman who leaves in a cab a vanity-bag with all her jewels in it.Nature had made him a butt, but had denied him insensibility.He writhed under the jokes, practical and otherwise, which were perpetually made at his expense, and yet never ceased, it seemed wilfully, to expose himself to them.He was constantly wounded, and yet his good nature was such that he could not bear malice：the viper might sting him, but he never learned by experience, and had no sooner recovered from his pain than he tenderly placed it once more in his bosom.His life was a tragedy written in the terms of knock-about farce.Because I did not laugh at him he was grateful to me, and he used to pour into my sympathetic ear the long list of his troubles.The saddest thing about them was that they were grotesque, and the more pathetic they were, the more you wanted to laugh.

But though so bad a painter, he had a very delicate feeling for art, and to go with him to picture galleries was a rare treat. His enthusiasm was sincere and his criticism acute.He was catholic.He had not only a true appreciation of the old masters, but sympathy with the moderns.He was quick to discover talent, and his praise was generous.I think I have never known a man whose judgement was surer.And he was better educated than most painters.He was not, like most of them, ignorant of kindred arts, and his taste for music and literature gave depth and variety to his comprehension of painting.To a young man like myself his advice and guidance was of incomparable value.

When I left Rome I corresponded with him, and about once in two months received from him long letters in queer English, which brought before me vividly his spluttering, enthusiastic, gesticulating conversation. Some time before I went to Paris he had married an Englishwoman, and was now settled in a studio in Montmartre.I had not seen him for four years, and had never met his wife.





Chapter XIX


I had not announced my arrival to Stroeve, and when I rang the bell of his studio, on opening the door himself, for a moment he did not know me. Then he gave a cry of delighted surprise and drew me in.It was charming to be welcomed with so much eagerness.His wife was seated near the stove at her sewing, and she rose as I came in.He introduced me.

“Don't you remember？”he said to her.“I've talked to you about him often.”And then to me：“But why didn't you let me know you were coming？How long have you been here？How long are you going to stay？Why didn't you come an hour earlier, and we would have dined together？”

He bombarded me with questions. He sat me down in a chair, patting me as though I were a cushion, pressed cigars upon me, cakes, wine.He could not leave me alone.He was heart-broken because he had no whisky, wanted to make coffee for me, racked his brain for something he could possibly do for me, and beamed and laughed, and in the exuberance of his delight sweated at every pore.

“You haven't changed，”I said, smiling, as I looked at him.

He had the same absurd appearance that I remembered. He was a fat little man, with short legs, young still-he could not have been more than thirty-but prematurely bald.His face was perfectly round, and he had a very high colour, a white skin, red cheeks, and red lips.His eyes were blue and round too, he wore large gold-rimmed spectacles, and his eyebrows were so fair that you could not see them.He reminded you of those jolly, fat merchants that Rubens painted.

When I told him that I meant to live in Paris for a while, and had taken an apartment, he reproached me bitterly for not having let him know. He would have found me an apartment himself, and lent me furniture-did I really mean that I had gone to the expense of buying it？-and he would have helped me to move in.He really looked upon it as unfriendly that I had not given him the opportunity of making himself useful to me.Meanwhile, Mrs.Stroeve sat quietly mending her stockings, without talking, and she listened to all he said with a quiet smile on her lips.

“So, you see, I'm married，”he said suddenly；“what do you think of my wife？”

He beamed at her, and settled his spectacles on the bridge of his nose. The sweat made them constantly slip down.

“What on earth do you expect me to say to that？”I laughed.

“Really, Dirk，”put in Mrs. Stroeve, smiling.

“But isn't she wonderful？I tell you, my boy, lose no time；get married as soon as ever you can. I'm the happiest man alive.Look at her sitting there.Doesn't she make a picture？Chardin, eh？I've seen all the most beautiful women in the world；I've never seen anyone more beautiful than Madame Dirk Stroeve.”

“If you don't be quiet, Dirk, I shall go away.”

“Mon petit chou，”he said.

She flushed a little, embarrassed by the passion in his tone. His letters had told me that he was very much in love with his wife, and I saw that he could hardly take his eyes off her.I could not tell if she loved him.Poor pantaloon, he was not an object to excite love, but the smile in her eyes was affectionate, and it was possible that her reserve concealed a very deep feeling.She was not the ravishing creature that his love-sick fancy saw, but she had a grave comeliness.She was rather tall, and her gray dress, simple and quite well-cut, did not hide the fact that her figure was beautiful.It was a figure that might have appealed more to the sculptor than to the costumier.Her hair, brown and abundant, was plainly done, her face was very pale, and her features were good without being distinguished.She had quiet grey eyes.She just missed being beautiful, and in missing it was not even pretty.But when Stroeve spoke of Chardin it was not without reason, and she reminded me curiously of that pleasant housewife in her mob-cap and apron whom the great painter has immortalized.I could imagine her sedately busy among her pots and pans, making a ritual of her household duties, so that they acquired a moral signifcance；I did not suppose that she was clever or could ever be amusing, but there was something in her grave intentness which excited my interest.Her reserve was not without mystery.I wondered why she had married Dirk Stroeve.Though she was English, I could not exactly place her, and it was not obvious from what rank in society she sprang, what had been her upbringing, or how she had lived before her marriage.She was very silent, but when she spoke it was with a pleasant voice, and her manners were natural.

I asked Stroeve if he was working.

“Working？I'm painting better than I've ever painted before.”

We sat in the studio, and he waved his hand to an unfinished picture on an easel. I gave a little start.He was painting a group of Italian peasants, in the costume of the Campagna, lounging on the steps of a Roman church.

“Is that what you're doing now？”I asked.

“Yes. I can get my models here just as well as in Rome.”

“Don't you think it's very beautiful？”said Mrs. Stroeve.

“This foolish wife of mine thinks I'm a great artist，”said he.

His apologetic laugh did not disguise the pleasure that he felt. His eyes lingered on his picture.It was strange that his critical sense, so accurate and unconventional when he dealt with the work of others, should be satisfied in himself with what was hackneyed and vulgar beyond belief.

“Show him some more of your pictures，”she said.

“Shall I？”

Though he had suffered so much from the ridicule of his friends, Dirk Stroeve, eager for praise and na?vely self-satisfied, could never resist displaying his work.He brought out a picture of two curly-headed Italian urchins playing marbles.

“Aren't they sweet？”said Mrs. Stroeve.

And then he showed me more. I discovered that in Paris he had been painting just the same stale, obviously picturesque things that he had painted for years in Rome.It was all false, insincere, shoddy；and yet no one was more honest, sincere, and frank than Dirk Stroeve.Who could resolve the contradiction？

I do not know what put it into my head to ask：

“I say, have you by any chance run across a painter called Charles Strickland？”

“You don't mean to say you know him？”cried Stroeve.

“Beast，”said his wife.

Stroeve laughed.

“Ma pauvre chérie.”He went over to her and kissed both her hands.“She doesn’t like him.How strange that you should know Strickland！”

“I don't like bad manners，”said Mrs. Stroeve.

Dirk, laughing still, turned to me to explain.

“You see, I asked him to come here one day and look at my pictures. Well, he came, and I showed him everything I had.”Stroeve hesitated a moment with embarrassment.I do not know why he had begun the story against himself；he felt an awkwardness at fnishing it.“He looked at-at my pictures, and he didn't say anything.I thought he was reserving his judgement till the end.And at last I said：‘There, that's the lot！'He said：‘I came to ask you to lend me twenty francs.'”

“And Dirk actually gave it him，”said his wife indignantly.

“I was so taken aback. I didn't like to refuse.He put the money in his pocket, just nodded, said‘Thanks，'and walked out.”

Dirk Stroeve, telling the story, had such a look of blank astonishment on his round, foolish face that it was almost impossible not to laugh.

“I shouldn't have minded if he'd said my pictures were bad, but he said nothing-nothing.”

“And you will tell the story, Dirk，”Said his wife.

It was lamentable that one was more amused by the ridiculous figure cut by the Dutchman than outraged by Strickland's brutal treatment of him.

“I hope I shall never see him again，”said Mrs. Stroeve.

Stroeve smiled and shrugged his shoulders. He had already recovered his good-humour.

“The fact remains that he's a great artist, a very great artist.”

“Strickland？”I exclaimed.“It can't be the same man.”

“A big fellow with a red beard. Charles Strickland.An English-man.”

“He had no beard when I knew him, but if he has grown one it might well be red. The man I'm thinking of only began painting five years ago.”

“That's it. He's a great artist.”

“Impossible.”

“Have I ever been mistaken？”Dirk asked me.“I tell you he has genius. I'm convinced of it.In a hundred years, if you and I are remembered at all, it will be because we knew Charles Strickland.”

I was astonished, and at the same time I was very much excited. I remembered suddenly my last talk with him.

“Where can one see his work？”I asked.“Is he having any success？Where is he living？”

“No；he has no success. I don't think he's ever sold a picture.When you speak to men about him they only laugh.But I know he's a great artist.After all, they laughed at Manet.Corot never sold a picture.I don't know where he lives, but I can take you to see him.He goes to a café in the Avenue de Clichy at seven o’clock every evening.If you like we’ll go there tomorrow.”

“I'm not sure if he'll wish to see me. I think I may remind him of a time he prefers to forget.But I'll come all the same.Is there any chance of seeing any of his pictures？”

“Not from him. He won't show you a thing.There's a little dealer I know who has two or three.But you mustn't go without me；you wouldn't understand.I must show them to you myself.”

“Dirk, you make me impatient，”said Mrs. Stroeve.“How can you talk like that about his pictures when he treated you as he did？”She turned to me.“Do you know, when some Dutch people came here to buy Dirk's pictures he tried to persuade them to buy Strickland's？He insisted on bringing them here to show.”

“What did you think of them？”I asked her, smiling.

“They were awful.”

“Ah, sweetheart, you don't understand.”

“Well, your Dutch people were furious with you. They thought you were having a joke with them.”

Dirk Stroeve took off his spectacles and wiped them. His fushed face was shining with excitement.

“Why should you think that beauty, which is the most precious thing in the world, lies like a stone on the beach for the careless passer-by to pick up idly？Beauty is something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul. And when he has made it, it is not given to all to know it.To recognize it you must repeat the adventure of the artist.It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.”

“Why did I always think your pictures beautiful, Dirk？I admired them the very frst time I saw them.”

Stroeve's lips trembled a little.

“Go to bed, my precious. I will walk a few steps with our friend, and then I will come back.”





Chapter XX


Dirk Stroeve agreed to fetch me on the following evening and take me to the café at which Strickland was most likely to be found.I was interested to learn that it was the same as that at which Strickland and I had drunk absinthe when I had gone over to Paris to see him.The fact that he had never changed suggested a sluggishness of habit which seemed to me characteristic.

“There he is，”said Stroeve, as we reached the café.

Though it was October, the evening was warm, and the tables on the pavement were crowded. I ran my eyes over them, but did not see Strickland.

“Look. Over there, in the corner.He's playing chess.”

I noticed a man bending over a chess-board, but could see only a large felt hat and a red beard. We threaded our way among the tables till we came to him.

“Strickland.”

He looked up.

“Hulloa, fatty. What do you want？”

“I've brought an old friend to see you.”

Strickland gave me a glance, and evidently did not recognize me. He resumed his scrutiny of the chess-board.

“Sit down, and don't make a noise，”he said.

He moved a piece and straightway became absorbed in the game. Poor Stroeve gave me a troubled look, but I was not disconcerted by so little.I ordered something to drink, and waited quietly till Strickland had fnished.I welcomed the opportunity to examine him at my ease.I certainly should never have known him.In the frst place his red beard, ragged and untrimmed, hid much of his face, and his hair was long；but the most surprising change in him was his extreme thinness.It made his great nose protrude more arrogantly；it emphasized his cheek-bones；it made his eyes seem larger.There were deep hollows at his temples.His body was cadaverous.He wore the same suit that I had seen him in fve years before；it was torn and stained, threadbare, and it hung upon him loosely, as though it had been made for someone else.I noticed his hands, dirty, with long nails；they were merely bone and sinew, large and strong；but I had forgotten that they were so shapely.He gave me an extraordinary impression as he sat there, his attention riveted on his game-an impression of great strength；and I could not understand why it was that his emaciation somehow made it more striking.

Presently, after moving, he leaned back and gazed with a curious abstraction at his antagonist. This was a fat, bearded Frenchman.The Frenchman considered the position, then broke suddenly into jovial expletives, and with an impatient gesture, gathering up the pieces, fung them into their box.He cursed Strickland freely, then, calling for the waiter, paid for the drinks, and left.Stroeve drew his chair closer to the table.

“Now I suppose we can talk，”he said.

Strickland's eyes rested on him, and there was in them a malicious expression. I felt sure he was seeking for some gibe, could think of none, and so was forced to silence.

“I've brought an old friend to see you，”repeated Stroeve, beaming cheerfully.

Strickland looked at me thoughtfully for nearly a minute. I did not speak.

“I've never seen him in my life，”he said.

I do not know why he said this, for I felt certain I had caught a gleam of recognition in his eyes. I was not so easily abashed as I had been some years earlier.

“I saw your wife the other day，”I said.“I felt sure you'd like to have the latest news of her.”

He gave a short laugh. His eyes twinkled.

“We had a jolly evening together，”he said.“How long ago is it？”

“Five years.”

He called for another absinthe. Stroeve, with voluble tongue, explained how he and I had met, and by what an accident we discovered that we both knew Strickland.I do not know if Strickland listened.He glanced at me once or twice refectively, but for the most part seemed occupied with his own thoughts；and certainly without Stroeve's babble the conversation would have been diffcult.In half an hour the Dutchman, looking at his watch, announced that he must go.He asked whether I would come too.I thought, alone, I might get something out of Strickland, and so answered that I would stay.

When the fat man had left I said：

“Dirk Stroeve thinks you're a great artist.”

“What the hell do you suppose I care？”

“Will you let me see your pictures？”

“Why should I？”

“I might feel inclined to buy one.”

“I might not feel inclined to sell one.”

“Are you making a good living？”I asked, smiling.

He chuckled.

“Do I look it？”

“You look half starved.”

“I am half starved.”

“Then come and let's have a bit of dinner.”

“Why do you ask me？”

“Not out of charity，”I answered coolly.“I don't really care a twopenny damn if you starve or not.”

His eyes lit up again.

“Come on, then，”he said, getting up.“I'd like a decent meal.”





Chapter XXI


I let him take me to a restaurant of his choice, but on the way I bought a paper. When he had ordered our dinner, I propped it against a bottle of St.Galmier and began to read.We ate in silence.I felt him looking at me now and again, but I took no notice.I meant to force him to conversation.

“Is there anything in the paper？”he said, as we approached the end of our silent meal.

I fancied there was in his tone a slight note of exasperation.

“I always like to read the feuilleton on the drama，”I said.

I folded the paper and put it down beside me.

“I've enjoyed my dinner，”he remarked.

“I think we might have our coffee here, don't you？”

“Yes.”

We lit our cigars. I smoked in silence.I noticed that now and then his eyes rested on me with a faint smile of amusement.I waited patiently.

“What have you been up to since I saw you last？”he asked at length.

I had not very much to say. It was a record of hard work and of little adventure；of experiments in this direction and in that；of the gradual acquisition of the knowledge of books and of men.I took care to ask Strickland nothing about his own doings.I showed not the least interest in him, and at last I was rewarded.He began to talk of himself.But with his poor gift of expression he gave but indications of what he had gone through, and I had to fll up the gaps with my own imagination.It was tantalizing to get no more than hints into a character that interested me so much.It was like making one's way through a mutilated manuscript.I received the impression of a life which was a bitter struggle against every sort of diffculty；but I realized that much which would have seemed horrible to most people did not in the least affect him.Strickland was distinguished from most Englishmen by his perfect indifference to comfort；it did not irk him to live always in one shabby room；he had no need to be surrounded by beautiful things.I do not suppose he had ever noticed how dingy was the paper on the wall of the room in which on my frst visit I found him.He did not want arm-chairs to sit in；he really felt more at his ease on a kitchen-chair.He ate with appetite, but was indifferent to what he ate；to him it was only food that he devoured to still the pangs of hunger；and when no food was to be had he seemed capable of doing without.I learned that for six months he had lived on a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk a day.He was a sensual man, and yet was indifferent to sensual things.He looked upon privation as no hardship.There was something impressive in the manner in which he lived a life wholly of the spirit.

When the small sum of money which he brought with him from London came to an end he suffered from no dismay. He sold no pictures；I think he made little attempt to sell any；he set about finding some way to make a bit of money.He told me with grim humour of the time he had spent acting as guide to Cockneys who wanted to see the night side of life in Paris；it was an occupation that appealed to his sardonic temper and somehow or other he had acquired a wide acquaintance with the more disreputable quarters of the city.He told me of the long hours he spent walking about the Boulevard de la Madeleine on the look-out for Englishmen, preferably the worse for liquor, who desired to see things which the law forbade.When in luck he was able to make a tidy sum；but the shabbiness of his clothes at last frightened the sightseers, and he could not find people adventurous enough to trust themselves to him.Then he happened on a job to translate the advertisements of patent medicines which were sent broadcast to the medical profession in England.During a strike he had been employed as a house-painter.

Meanwhile he had never ceased to work at his art；but, soon tiring of the studios, entirely by himself. He had never been so poor that he could not buy canvas and paint, and really he needed nothing else.So far as I could make out, he painted with great diffculty, and in his unwillingness to accept help from anyone lost much time in finding out for himself the solution of technical problems which preceding generations had already worked out one by one.He was aiming at something, I knew not what, and perhaps he hardly knew himself；and I got again more strongly the impression of a man possessed.He did not seem quite sane.It seemed to me that he would not show his pictures because he was really not interested in them.He lived in a dream, and the reality meant nothing to him.I had the feeling that he worked on a canvas with all the force of his violent personality, oblivious of everything in his effort to get what he saw with the mind's eye；and then, having fnished, not the picture perhaps, for I had an idea that he seldom brought anything to completion, but the passion that fred him, he lost all care for it.He was never satisfied with what he had done：it seemed to him of no consequence compared with the vision that obsessed his mind.

“Why don't you ever send your work to exhibitions？”I asked.“I should have thought you'd like to know what people thought about it.”

“Would you？”

I cannot describe the unmeasurable contempt he put into the two words.

“Don't you want fame？It's something that most artists haven't been indifferent to.”

“Children. How can you care for the opinion of the crowd, when you don't care twopence for the opinion of the individual？”

“We're not all reasonable beings，”I laughed.

“Who makes fame？Critics, writers, stockbrokers, women.”

“Wouldn't it give you a rather pleasant sensation to think of people you didn't know and had never seen receiving emotions, subtle and passionate, from the work of your hands？Everyone likes power. I can't imagine a more wonderful exercise of it than to move the souls of men to pity or terror.”

“Melodrama.”

“Why do you mind if you paint well or badly？”

“I don't. I only want to paint what I see.”

“I wonder if I could write on a desert island, with the certainty that no eyes but mine would ever see what I had written.”

Strickland did not speak for a long time, but his eyes shone strangely, as though he saw something that kindled his soul to ecstasy.

“Sometimes I've thought of an island lost in a boundless sea, where I could live in some hidden valley, among strange trees, in silence. There I think I could fnd what I want.”

He did not express himself quite like this. He used gestures instead of adjectives, and he halted.I have put into my own words what I think he wanted to say.

“Looking back on the last fve years, do you think it was worth it？”I asked.

He looked at me, and I saw that he did not know what I meant. I explained.

“You gave up a comfortable home and a life as happy as the average. You were fairly prosperous.You seem to have had a rotten time in Paris.If you had your time over again would you do what you did？”

“Rather.”

“Do you know that you haven't asked anything about your wife and children？Do you never think of them？”

“No.”

“I wish you weren't so damned monosyllabic. Have you never had a moment's regret for all the unhappiness you caused them？”

His lips broke into a smile, and he shook his head.

“I should have thought sometimes you couldn't help thinking of the past. I don't mean the past of seven or eight years ago, but further back still, when you frst met your wife, and loved her, and married her.Don't you remember the joy with which you frst took her in your arms？”

“I don't think of the past. The only thing that matters is the everlasting present.”

I thought for a moment over this reply. It was obscure perhaps, but I thought that I saw dimly his meaning.

“Are you happy？”I asked.

“Yes.”

I was silent. I looked at him reflectively.He held my stare, and presently a sardonic twinkle lit up his eyes.

“I'm afraid you disapprove of me？”

“Nonsense，”I answered promptly；“I don't disapprove of the boa-constrictor；on the contrary, I'm interested in his mental processes.”

“It's a purely professional interest you take in me？”

“Purely.”

“It's only right that you shouldn't disapprove of me. You have a despicable character.”

“Perhaps that's why you feel at home with me，”I retorted.

He smiled dryly, but said nothing. I wish I knew how to describe his smile.I do not know that it was attractive, but it lit up his face, changing the expression, which was generally sombre, and gave it a look of not ill-natured malice.It was a slow smile, starting and sometimes ending in the eyes；it was very sensual, neither cruel nor kindly, but suggested rather the inhuman glee of the satyr.It was his smile that made me ask him：

“Haven't you been in love since you came to Paris？”

“I haven't got time for that sort of nonsense. Life isn't long enough for love and art.”

“Your appearance doesn't suggest the anchorite.”

“All that business flls me with disgust.”

“Human nature is a nuisance, isn't it？”I said.

“Why are you sniggering at me？”

“Because I don't believe you.”

“Then you're a damned fool.”

I paused, and I looked at him searchingly.

“What's the good of trying to humbug me？”I said.

“I don't know what you mean.”

I smiled.

“Let me tell you. I imagine that for months the matter never comes into your head, and you're able to persuade yourself that you've fnished with it for good and all.You rejoice in your freedom, and you feel that at last you can call your soul your own.You seem to walk with your head among the stars.And then, all of a sudden you can't stand it any more, and you notice that all the time your feet have been walking in the mud.And you want to roll yourself in it.And you fnd some woman, coarse and low and vulgar, some beastly creature in whom all the horror of sex is blatant, and you fall upon her like a wild animal.You drink till you're blind with rage.”

He stared at me without the slightest movement. I held his eyes with mine.I spoke very slowly.

“I'll tell you what must seem strange, that when it's over you feel so extraordinarily pure. You feel like a disembodied spirit, immaterial；and you seem to be able to touch beauty as though it were a palpable thing；and you feel an intimate communion with the breeze, and with the trees breaking into leaf, and with the iridescence of the river.You feel like God.Can you explain that to me？”

He kept his eyes fixed on mine till I had finished, and then he turned away. There was on his face a strange look, and I thought that so might a man look when he had died under the torture.He was silent.I knew that our conversation was ended.





Chapter XXII


I settled down in Paris and began to write a play. I led a very regular life, working in the morning, and in the afternoon lounging about the gardens of the Luxembourg or sauntering through the streets.I spent long hours in the Louvre, the most friendly of all galleries and the most convenient for meditation；or idled on the quays, fngering second-hand books that I never meant to buy.I read a page here and there, and made acquaintance with a great many authors whom I was content to know thus desultorily.In the evenings I went to see my friends.I looked in often on the Stroeves, and sometimes shared their modest fare.Dirk Stroeve flattered himself on his skill in cooking Italian dishes, and I confess that his spaghetti were very much better than his pictures.It was a dinner for a King when he brought in a huge dish of it, succulent with tomatoes, and we ate it together with the good household bread and a bottle of red wine.I grew more intimate with Blanche Stroeve, and I think, because I was English and she knew few English people, she was glad to see me.She was pleasant and simple, but she remained always rather silent, and, I knew not why, gave me the impression that she was concealing something.But I thought that was perhaps no more than a natural reserve accentuated by the verbose frankness of her husband.Dirk never concealed anything.He discussed the most intimate matters with a complete lack of self-consciousness.Sometimes he embarrassed his wife, and the only time I saw her put out of countenance was when he insisted on telling me that he had taken a purge, and went into somewhat realistic details on the subject.The perfect seriousness with which he narrated his misfortunes convulsed me with laughter, and this added to Mrs.Stroeve's irritation.

“You seem to like making a fool of yourself，”she said.

His round eyes grew rounder still, and his brow puckered in dismay as he saw that she was angry.

“Sweetheart, have I vexed you？I'll never take another. It was only because I was bilious.I lead a sedentary life.I don't take enough exercise.For three days I hadn't……”

“For goodness'sake, hold your tongue，”she interrupted, tears of annoyance in her eyes.

His face fell, and he pouted his lips like a scolded child. He gave me a look of appeal, so that I might put things right, but, unable to control myself, I shook with helpless laughter.

We went one day to the picture-dealer in whose shop Stroeve thought he could show me at least two or three of Strickland's pictures, but when we arrived were told that Strickland himself had taken them away. The dealer did not know why.

“But don't imagine to yourself that I make myself bad blood on that account. I took them to oblige Monsieur Stroeve, and I said I would sell them if I could.But really-”He shrugged his shoulders.“I'm interested in the young men, but voyons, you yourself, Monsieur Stroeve, you don't think there's any talent there.”

“I give you my word of honour, there's no one painting today in whose talent I am more convinced. Take my word for it, you are missing a good affair.Some day those pictures will be worth more than all you have in your shop.Remember Monet, who could not get anyone to buy his pictures for a hundred francs.What are they worth now？”

“True. But there were a hundred as good painters as Monet who couldn't sell their pictures at that time, and their pictures are worth nothing still.How can one tell？Is merit enough to bring success？Don't believe it.Du reste, it has still to be proved that this friend of yours has merit.No one claims it for him but Monsieur Stroeve.”

“And how, then, will you recognize merit？”asked Dirk, red in the face with anger.

“There is only one way-by success.”

“Philistine，”cried Dirk.

“But think of the great artists of the past-Raphael, Michael Angelo, Ingres, Delacroix-they were all successful.”

“Let us go，”said Stroeve to me，“or I shall kill this man.”





Chapter XXIII


I saw Strickland not infrequently, and now and then played chess with him. He was of uncertain temper.Sometimes he would sit silent and abstracted, taking no notice of anyone；and at others, when he was in a good humour, he would talk in his own halting way.He never said a clever thing, but he had a vein of brutal sarcasm which was not ineffective, and he always said exactly what he thought.He was indifferent to the susceptibilities of others, and when he wounded them was amused.He was constantly offending Dirk Stroeve so bitterly that he flung away, vowing he would never speak to him again；but there was a solid force in Strickland that attracted the fat Dutchman against his will, so that he came back, fawning like a clumsy dog, though he knew that his only greeting would be the blow he dreaded.

I do not know why Strickland put up with me. Our relations were peculiar.One day he asked me to lend him ffty francs.

“I wouldn't dream of it，”I replied.

“Why not？”

“It wouldn't amuse me.”

“I'm frightfully hard up, you know.”

“I don't care.”

“You don't care if I starve？”

“Why on earth should I？”I asked in my turn.

He looked at me for a minute or two, pulling his untidy beard. I smiled at him.

“What are you amused at？”he said, with a gleam of anger in his eyes.

“You're so simple. You recognize no obligations.No one is under any obligation to you.”

“Wouldn't it make you uncomfortable if I went and hanged myself because I'd been turned out of my room as I couldn't pay the rent？”

“Not a bit.”

He chuckled.

“You're bragging. If I really did you'd be overwhelmed with remorse.”

“Try it, and we'll see，”I retorted.

A smile fickered in his eyes, and he stirred his absinthe in silence.

“Would you like to play chess？”I asked.

“I don't mind.”

We set up the pieces, and when the board was ready he considered it with a comfortable eye. There is a sense of satisfaction in looking at your men all ready for the fray.

“Did you really think I'd lend you money？”I asked.

“I didn't see why you shouldn't.”

“You surprise me.”

“Why？”

“It's disappointing to fnd that at heart you are sentimental. I should have liked you better if you hadn't made that ingenuous appeal to my sympathies.”

“I should have despised you if you'd been moved by it，”he answered.

“That's better，”I laughed.

We began to play. We were both absorbed in the game.When it was fnished I said to him：

“Look here, if you're hard up, let me see your pictures. If there's anything I like I'll buy it.”

“Go to hell，”he answered.

He got up and was about to go away. I stopped him.

“You haven't paid for your absinthe，”I said, smiling.

He cursed me, fung down the money, and left.

I did not see him for several days after that, but one evening, when I was sitting in the café，reading a paper, he came up and sat beside me.

“You haven't hanged yourself after all，”I remarked.

“No. I've got a commission.I'm painting the portrait of a retired plumber for two hundred francs.”5

“How did you manage that？”

“The woman where I get my bread recommended me. He'd told her he was looking out for someone to paint him.I've got to give her twenty francs.”

“What's he like？”

“Splendid. He's got a great red face like a leg of mutton, and on his right cheek there's an enormous mole with long hairs growing out of it.”

Strickland was in a good humour, and when Dirk Stroeve came up and sat down with us he attacked him with ferocious banter. He showed a skill I should never have credited him with in fnding the places where the unhappy Dutchman was most sensitive.Strickland employed not the rapier of sarcasm but the bludgeon of invective.The attack was so unprovoked that Stroeve, taken unawares, was defenceless.He reminded you of a frightened sheep running aimlessly hither and thither.He was startled and amazed.At last the tears ran from his eyes.And the worst of it was that, though you hated Strickland, and the exhibition was horrible, it was impossible not to laugh.Dirk Stroeve was one of those unlucky persons whose most sincere emotions are ridiculous.

But after all when I look back upon that winter in Paris, my pleasantest recollection is of Dirk Stroeve. There was something very charming in his little household.He and his wife made a picture which the imagination gratefully dwelt upon, and the simplicity of his love for her had a deliberate grace.He remained absurd, but the sincerity of his passion excited one's sympathy.I could understand how his wife must feel for him, and I was glad that her affection was so tender.If she had any sense of humour, it must amuse her that he should place her on a pedestal and worship her with such an honest idolatry, but even while she laughed she must have been pleased and touched.He was the constant lover, and though she grew old, losing her rounded lines and her fair comeliness, to him she would certainly never alter.To him she would always be the loveliest woman in the world.There was a pleasing grace in the orderliness of their lives.They had but the studio, a bedroom, and a tiny kitchen.Mrs.Stroeve did all the housework herself；and while Dirk painted bad pictures, she went marketing, cooked the luncheon, sewed, occupied herself like a busy ant all the day；and in the evening sat in the studio, sewing again, while Dirk played music which I am sure was far beyond her comprehension.He played with taste, but with more feeling than was always justifed, and into his music poured all his honest, sentimental, exuberant soul.

Their life in its own way was an idyl, and it managed to achieve a singular beauty. The absurdity that clung to everything connected with Dirk Stroeve gave it a curious note, like an unresolved discord, but made it somehow more modern, more human；like a rough joke thrown into a serious scene, it heightened the poignancy which all beauty has.





Chapter XXIV


Shortly before Christmas Dirk Stroeve came to ask me to spend the holiday with him. He had a characteristic sentimentality about the day and wanted to pass it among his friends with suitable ceremonies.Neither of us had seen Strickland for two or three weeks-I because I had been busy with friends who were spending a little while in Paris, and Stroeve because, having quarrelled with him more violently than usual, he had made up his mind to have nothing more to do with him.Strickland was impossible, and he swore never to speak to him again.But the season touched him with gentle feeling, and he hated the thought of Strickland spending Christmas Day by himself；he ascribed his own emotions to him, and could not bear that on an occasion given up to good fellowship the lonely painter should be abandoned to his own melancholy.Stroeve had set up a Christmas-tree in his studio, and I suspected that we should both fnd absurd little presents hanging on its festive branches；but he was shy about seeing Strickland again；it was a little humiliating to forgive so easily insults so outrageous, and he wished me to be present at the reconciliation on which he was determined.

We walked together down the Avenue de Clichy, but Strickland was not in the café.It was too cold to sit outside, and we took our places on leather benches within.It was hot and stuffy, and the air was grey with smoke.Strickland did not come, but presently we saw the French painter who occasionally played chess with him.I had formed a casual acquaintance with him, and he sat down at our table.Stroeve asked him if he had seen Strickland.

“He's ill，”he said.“Didn't you know？”

“Seriously？”

“Very, I understand.”

Stroeve's face grew white.

“Why didn't he write and tell me？How stupid of me to quarrel with him！We must go to him at once. He can have no one to look after him.Where does he live？”

“I have no idea，”said the Frenchman.

We discovered that none of us knew how to fnd him. Stroeve grew more and more distressed.

“He might die, and not a soul would know anything about it. It's dreadful.I can't bear the thought.We must fnd him at once.”

I tried to make Stroeve understand that it was absurd to hunt vaguely about Paris. We must frst think of some plan.

“Yes；but all this time he may be dying, and when we get there it may be too late to do anything.”

“Sit still and let us think，”I said impatiently.

The only address I knew was the H?tel des Belges, but Strickland had long left that, and they would have no recollection of him.With that queer idea of his to keep his whereabouts secret, it was unlikely that, on leaving, he had said where he was going.Besides, it was more than fve years ago.I felt pretty sure that he had not moved far.If he continued to frequent the same café as when he had stayed at the hotel, it was probably because it was the most convenient.Suddenly I remembered that he had got his commission to paint a portrait through the baker from whom he bought his bread, and it struck me that there one might fnd his address.I called for a directory and looked out the bakers.There were fve in the immediate neighbourhood, and the only thing was to go to all of them.Stroeve accompanied me unwillingly.His own plan was to run up and down the streets that led out of the Avenue de Clichy and ask at every house if Strickland lived there.My commonplace scheme was, after all, effective, for in the second shop we asked at the woman behind the counter acknowledged that she knew him.She was not certain where he lived, but it was in one of the three houses opposite.Luck favoured us, and in the frst we tried the concierge told us that we should fnd him on the top foor.

“It appears that he's ill，”said Stroeve.

“It may be，”answered the concierge indifferently.“En effet, I have not seen him for several days.”

Stroeve ran up the stairs ahead of me, and when I reached the top floor I found him talking to a workman in his shirt sleeves who had opened a door at which Stroeve had knocked. He pointed to another door.He believed that the person who lived there was a painter.He had not seen him for a week.Stroeve made as though he were about to knock, and then turned to me with a gesture of helplessness.I saw that he was panic-stricken.

“Supposing he's dead？”

“Not he，”I said.

I knocked. There was no answer.I tried the handle, and found the door unlocked.I walked in, and Stroeve followed me.The room was in darkness.I could only see that it was an attic, with a sloping roof；and a faint glimmer, no more than a less profound obscurity, came from a skylight.

“Strickland，”I called.

There was no answer. It was really rather mysterious, and it seemed to me that Stroeve, standing just behind, was trembling in his shoes.For a moment I hesitated to strike a light.I dimly perceived a bed in the corner, and I wondered whether the light would disclose lying on it a dead body.

“Haven't you got a match, you fool？”

Strickland's voice, coming out of the darkness, harshly, made me start.

Stroeve cried out.

“Oh, my God, I thought you were dead.”

I struck a match, and looked about for a candle. I had a rapid glimpse of a tiny apartment, half room, half studio, in which was nothing but a bed, canvases with their faces to the wall, an easel, a table, and a chair.There was no carpet on the foor.There was no fre-place.On the table, crowded with paints, palette-knives, and litter of all kinds, was the end of a candle.I lit it.Strickland was lying in the bed, uncomfortably because it was too small for him, and he had put all his clothes over him for warmth.It was obvious at a glance that he was in a high fever.Stroeve, his voice cracking with emotion, went up to him.

“Oh, my poor friend, what is the matter with you？I had no idea you were ill. Why didn't you let me know？You must know I'd have done anything in the world for you.Were you thinking of what I said？I didn't mean it.I was wrong.It was stupid of me to take offence.”

“Go to hell，”said Strickland.

“Now, be reasonable. Let me make you comfortable.Haven't you anyone to look after you？”

He looked round the squalid attic in dismay. He tried to arrange the bedclothes.Strickland, breathing laboriously, kept an angry silence.He gave me a resentful glance.I stood quite quietly, looking at him.

“If you want to do something for me, you can get me some milk，”he said at last.“I haven't been able to get out for two days.”

There was an empty bottle by the side of the bed, which had contained milk, and in a piece of newspaper a few crumbs.

“What have you been having？”I asked.

“Nothing.”

“For how long？”cried Stroeve.“Do you mean to say you've had nothing to eat or drink for two days？It's horrible.”

“I've had water.”

His eyes dwelt for a moment on a large can within reach of an outstretched arm.

“I'll go immediately，”said Stroeve.“Is there anything you fancy？”

I suggested that he should get a thermometer, and a few grapes, and some bread. Stroeve, glad to make himself useful, clattered down the stairs.

“Damned fool，”muttered Strickland.

I felt his pulse. It was beating quickly and feebly.I asked him one or two questions, but he would not answer, and when I pressed him he turned his face irritably to the wall.The only thing was to wait in silence.In ten minutes Stroeve, panting, came back.Besides what I had suggested, he brought candles, and meat-juice, and a spirit-lamp.He was a practical little fellow, and without delay set about making bread-and-milk.I took Strickland's temperature.It was a hundred and four.He was obviously very ill.





Chapter XXV


Presently we left him. Dirk was going home to dinner, and I proposed to find a doctor and bring him to see Strickland；but when we got down into the street, fresh after the stuffy attic, the Dutchman begged me to go immediately to his studio.He had something in mind which he would not tell me, but he insisted that it was very necessary for me to accompany him.Since I did not think a doctor could at the moment do any more than we had done, I consented.We found Blanche Stroeve laying the table for dinner.Dirk went up to her, and took both her hands.

“Dear one, I want you to do something for me，”he said.

She looked at him with the grave cheerfulness which was one of her charms. His red face was shining with sweat, and he had a look of comic agitation, but there was in his round, surprised eyes an eager light.

“Strickland is very ill. He may be dying.He is alone in a filthy attic, and there is not a soul to look after him.I want you to let me bring him here.”

She withdrew her hands quickly-I had never seen her make so rapid a movement-and her cheeks fushed.

“Oh no.”

“Oh, my dear one, don't refuse. I couldn't bear to leave him where he is.I shouldn't sleep a wink for thinking of him.”

“I have no objection to your nursing him.”

Her voice was cold and distant.

“But he'll die.”

“Let him.”

Stroeve gave a little gasp. He wiped his face.He turned to me for support, but I did not know what to say.

“He's a great artist.”

“What do I care？I hate him.”

“Oh, my love, my precious, you don't mean that. I beseech you to let me bring him here.We can make him comfortable.Perhaps we can save him.He shall be no trouble to you.I will do everything.We'll make him up a bed in the studio.We can't let him die like a dog.It would be inhuman.”

“Why can't he go to a hospital？”

“A hospital！He needs the care of loving hands. He must be treated with infnite tact.”

I was surprised to see how moved she was. She went on laying the table, but her hands trembled.

“I have no patience with you. Do you think if you were ill he would stir a fnger to help you？”

“But what does that matter？I should have you to nurse me. It wouldn't be necessary.And besides, I'm different；I'm not of any importance.”

“You have no more spirit than a mongrel cur. You lie down on the ground and ask people to trample on you.”

Stroeve gave a little laugh. He thought he understood the reason of his wife's attitude.

“Oh, my poor dear, you're thinking of that day he came here to look at my pictures. What does it matter if he didn't think them any good？It was stupid of me to show them to him.I dare say they're not very good.”

He looked round the studio ruefully. On the easel was a half-fnished picture of a smiling Italian peasant, holding a bunch of grapes over the head of a dark-eyed girl.

“Even if he didn't like them he should have been civil. He needn't have insulted you.He showed that he despised you, and you lick his hand.Oh, I hate him.”

“Dear child, he has genius. You don't think I believe that I have it.I wish I had；but I know it when I see it, and I honour it with all my heart.It's the most wonderful thing in the world.It's a great burden to its possessors.We should be very tolerant with them, and very patient.”

I stood apart, somewhat embarrassed by the domestic scene, and wondered why Stroeve had insisted on my coming with him. I saw that his wife was on the verge of tears.

“But it's not only because he's a genius that I ask you to let me bring him here；it's because he's a human being, and he is ill and poor.”

“I will never have him in my house-never.”

Stroeve turned to me.

“Tell her that it's a matter of life and death. It's impossible to leave him in that wretched hole.”

“It's quite obvious that it would be much easier to nurse him here，”I said，“but of course it would be very inconvenient. I have an idea that someone will have to be with him day and night.”

“My love, it's not you who would shirk a little trouble.”

“If he comes here, I shall go，”said Mrs. Stroeve violently.

“I don't recognize you. You're so good and kind.”

“Oh, for goodness'sake, let me be. You drive me to distraction.”

Then at last the tears came. She sank into a chair, and buried her face in her hands.Her shoulders shook convulsively.In a moment Dirk was on his knees beside her, with his arms round her, kissing her, calling her all sorts of pet names, and the facile tears ran down his own cheeks.Presently she released herself and dried her eyes.

“Leave me alone，”she said, not unkindly；and then to me, trying to smile：“What must you think of me？”

Stroeve, looking at her with perplexity, hesitated. His forehead was all puckered, and his red mouth set in a pout.He reminded me oddly of an agitated guinea-pig.

“Then it's No, darling？”he said at last.

She gave a gesture of lassitude. She was exhausted.

“The studio is yours. Everything belongs to you.If you want to bring him here, how can I prevent you？”

A sudden smile fashed across his round face.

“Then you consent？I knew you would. Oh, my precious.”

Suddenly she pulled herself together. She looked at him with haggard eyes.She clasped her hands over her heart as though its beating were intolerable.

“Oh, Dirk, I've never since we met asked you to do anything for me.”

“You know there's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do for you.”

“I beg you not to let Strickland come here. Anyone else you like.Bring a thief, a drunkard, any outcast off the streets, and I promise you I'll do everything I can for them gladly.But I beseech you not to bring Strickland here.”

“But why？”

“I'm frightened of him. I don't know why, but there's something in him that terrifes me.He'll do us some great harm.I know it.I feel it.If you bring him here it can only end badly.”

“But how unreasonable！”

“No, no. I know I'm right.Something terrible will happen to us.”

“Because we do a good action？”

She was panting now, and in her face was a terror which was inexplicable. I do not know what she thought.I felt that she was possessed by some shapeless dread which robbed her of all self-control.As a rule she was so calm；her agitation now was amazing.Stroeve looked at her for a while with puzzled consternation.

“You are my wife；you are dearer to me than anyone in the world. No one shall come here without your entire consent.”

She closed her eyes for a moment, and I thought she was going to faint. I was a little impatient with her；I had not suspected that she was so neurotic a woman.Then I heard Stroeve's voice again.It seemed to break oddly on the silence.

“Haven't you been in bitter distress once when a helping hand was held out to you？You know how much it means. Wouldn't you like to do someone a good turn when you have the chance？”

The words were ordinary enough, and to my mind there was in them something so hortatory that I almost smiled. I was astonished at the effect they had on Blanche Stroeve.She started a little, and gave her husband a long look.His eyes were fxed on the ground.I did not know why he seemed embarrassed.A faint colour came into her cheeks, and then her face became white-more than white, ghastly；you felt that the blood had shrunk away from the whole surface of her body；and even her hands were pale.A shiver passed through her.The silence of the studio seemed to gather body, so that it became an almost palpable presence.I was bewildered.

“Bring Strickland here, Dirk. I'll do my best for him.”

“My precious，”he smiled.

He wanted to take her in his arms, but she avoided him.

“Don't be affectionate before strangers, Dirk，”she said.“It makes me feel such a fool.”

Her manner was quite normal again, and no one could have told that so shortly before she had been shaken by such a great emotion.





Chapter XXVI


Next day we moved Strickland. It needed a good deal of frmness and still more patience to induce him to come, but he was really too ill to offer any effective resistance to Stroeve's entreaties and to my determination.We dressed him, while he feebly cursed us, got him downstairs, into a cab, and eventually to Stroeve's studio.He was so exhausted by the time we arrived that he allowed us to put him to bed without a word.He was ill for six weeks.At one time it looked as though he could not live more than a few hours, and I am convinced that it was only through the Dutchman's doggedness that he pulled through.I have never known a more diffcult patient.It was not that he was exacting and querulous；on the contrary, he never complained, he asked for nothing, he was perfectly silent；but he seemed to resent the care that was taken of him；he received all inquiries about his feelings or his needs with a jibe, a sneer, or an oath.I found him detestable, and as soon as he was out of danger I had no hesitation in telling him so.

“Go to hell，”he answered briefy.

Dirk Stroeve, giving up his work entirely, nursed Strickland with tenderness and sympathy. He was dexterous to make him comfortable, and he exercised a cunning of which I should never have thought him capable to induce him to take the medicines prescribed by the doctor.Nothing was too much trouble for him.Though his means were adequate to the needs of himself and his wife, he certainly had no money to waste；but now he was wantonly extravagant in the purchase of delicacies, out of season and dear, which might tempt Strickland's capricious appetite.I shall never forget the tactful patience with which he persuaded him to take nourishment.He was never put out by Strickland's rudeness；if it was merely sullen, he appeared not to notice it；if it was aggressive, he only chuckled.When Strickland, recovering somewhat, was in a good humour and amused himself by laughing at him, he deliberately did absurd things to excite his ridicule.Then he would give me little happy glances, so that I might notice in how much better form the patient was.Stroeve was sublime.

But it was Blanche who most surprised me. She proved herself not only a capable, but a devoted nurse.There was nothing in her to remind you that she had so vehemently struggled against her husband's wish to bring Strickland to the studio.She insisted on doing her share of the offces needful to the sick.She arranged his bed so that it was possible to change the sheet without disturbing him.She washed him.When I remarked on her competence, she told me with that pleasant little smile of hers that for a while she had worked in a hospital.She gave no sign that she hated Strickland so desperately.She did not speak to him much, but she was quick to forestall his wants.For a fortnight it was necessary that someone should stay with him all night, and she took turns at watching with her husband.I wondered what she thought during the long darkness as she sat by the bedside.Strickland was a weird fgure as he lay there, thinner than ever, with his ragged red beard and his eyes staring feverishly into vacancy；his illness seemed to have made them larger, and they had an unnatural brightness.

“Does he ever talk to you in the night？”I asked her once.

“Never.”

“Do you dislike him as much as you did？”

“More, if anything.”

She looked at me with her calm gray eyes. Her expression was so placid, it was hard to believe that she was capable of the violent emotion I had witnessed.

“Has he ever thanked you for what you do for him？”

“No，”she smiled.

“He's inhuman.”

“He's abominable.”

Stroeve was, of course, delighted with her. He could not do enough to show his gratitude for the whole-hearted devotion with which she had accepted the burden he laid on her.But he was a little puzzled by the behaviour of Blanche and Strickland towards one another.

“Do you know, I've seen them sit there for hours together without saying a word？”

On one occasion, when Strickland was so much better that in a day or two he was to get up, I sat with them in the studio. Dirk and I were talking.Mrs.Stroeve sewed, and I thought I recognised the shirt she was mending as Strickland's.He lay on his back；he did not speak.Once I saw that his eyes were fxed on Blanche Stroeve, and there was in them a curious irony.Feeling their gaze, she raised her own, and for a moment they stared at one another.I could not quite understand her expression.Her eyes had in them a strange perplexity, and perhaps-but why？-alarm.In a moment Strickland looked away and idly surveyed the ceiling, but she continued to stare at him, and now her look was quite inexplicable.

In a few days Strickland began to get up. He was nothing but skin and bone.His clothes hung upon him like rags on a scarecrow.With his untidy beard and long hair, his features, always a little larger than life, now emphasised by illness, he had an extraordinary aspect；but it was so odd that it was not quite ugly.There was something monumental in his ungainliness.I do not know how to express precisely the impression he made upon me.It was not exactly spirituality that was obvious, though the screen of the flesh seemed almost transparent, because there was in his face an outrageous sensuality；but, though it sounds nonsense, it seemed as though his sensuality were curiously spiritual.There was in him something primitive.He seemed to partake of those obscure forces of nature which the Greeks personifed in shapes part human and part beast, the satyr and the faun.I thought of Marsyas, whom the god fayed because he had dared to rival him in song.Strickland seemed to bear in his heart strange harmonies and unadventured patterns, and I foresaw for him an end of torture and despair.I had again the feeling that he was possessed of a devil；but you could not say that it was a devil of evil, for it was a primitive force that existed before good and ill.

He was still too weak to paint, and he sat in the studio, silent, occupied with God knows what dreams, or reading. The books he liked were queer；sometimes I would find him poring over the poems of Mallarmé，and he read them as a child reads, forming the words with his lips, and I wondered what strange emotion he got from those subtle cadences and obscure phrases；and again I found him absorbed in the detective novels of Gaboriau.I amused myself by thinking that in his choice of books he showed pleasantly the irreconcilable sides of his fantastic nature.It was singular to notice that even in the weak state of his body he had no thought for its comfort.Stroeve liked his ease， and in his studio were a couple of heavily upholstered arm-chairs and a large divan.Strickland would not go near them, not from any affectation of stoicism, for I found him seated on a three-legged stool when I went into the studio one day and he was alone, but because he did not like them.For choice he sat on a kitchen chair without arms.It often exasperated me to see him.I never knew a man so entirely indifferent to his surroundings.





Chapter XXVII


Two or three weeks passed. One morning, having come to a pause in my work, I thought I would give myself a holiday, and I went to the Louvre.I wandered about looking at the pictures I knew so well, and let my fancy play idly with the emotions they suggested.I sauntered into the long gallery, and there suddenly saw Stroeve.I smiled, for his appearance, so rotund and yet so startled, could never fail to excite a smile, and then as I came nearer I noticed that he seemed singularly disconsolate.He looked woebegone and yet ridiculous, like a man who has fallen into the water with all his clothes on, and, being rescued from death, frightened still, feels that he only looks a fool.Turning round, he stared at me, but I perceived that he did not see me.His round blue eyes looked harrassed behind his glasses.

“Stroeve，”I said.

He gave a little start, and then smiled, but his smile was rueful.

“Why are you idling in this disgraceful fashion？”I asked gaily.

“It's a long time since I was at the Louvre. I thought I'd come and see if they had anything new.”

“But you told me you had to get a picture fnished this week.”

“Strickland's painting in my studio.”

“Well？”

“I suggested it myself. He's not strong enough to go back to his own place yet.I thought we could both paint there.Lots of fellows in the Quarter share a studio.I thought it would be fun.I've always thought it would be jolly to have someone to talk to when one was tired of work.”

He said all this slowly, detaching statement from statement with a little awkward silence, and he kept his kind, foolish eyes fxed on mine. They were full of tears.

“I don't think I understand，”I said.

“Strickland can't work with anyone else in the studio.”

“Damn it all, it's your studio. That's his look-out.”

He looked at me pitifully. His lips were trembling.

“What happened？”I asked, rather sharply.

He hesitated and flushed. He glanced unhappily at one of the pictures on the wall.

“He wouldn't let me go on painting. He told me to get out.”

“But why didn't you tell him to go to hell？”

“He turned me out. I couldn't very well struggle with him.He threw my hat after me, and locked the door.”

I was furious with Strickland, and was indignant with myself, because Dirk Stroeve cut such an absurd figure that I felt inclined to laugh.

“But what did your wife say？”

“She'd gone out to do some marketing.”

“Is he going to let her in？”

“I don't know.”

I gazed at Stroeve with perplexity. He stood like a schoolboy with whom a master is fnding fault.

“Shall I get rid of Strickland for you？”I asked.

He gave a little start, and his shining face grew very red.

“No. You'd better not do anything.”

He nodded to me and walked away. It was clear that for some reason he did not want to discuss the matter.I did not understand.





Chapter XXVIII


The explanation came a week later. It was about ten o'clock at night；I had been dining by myself at a restaurant, and having returned to my small apartment, was sitting in my parlour, reading.I heard the cracked tinkling of the bell, and, going into the corridor, opened the door.Stroeve stood before me.

“Can I come in？”he asked.

In the dimness of the landing I could not see him very well, but there was something in his voice that surprised me. I knew he was of abstemious habit or I should have thought he had been drinking.I led the way into my sitting-room and asked him to sit down.

“Thank God I've found you，”he said.

“What's the matter？”I asked in astonishment at his vehemence.

I was able now to see him well. As a rule he was neat in his person, but now his clothes were in disorder.He looked suddenly bedraggled.I was convinced he had been drinking, and I smiled.I was on the point of chaffng him on his state.

“I didn't know where to go，”he burst out.“I came here earlier, but you weren't in.”

“I dined late，”I said.

I changed my mind：it was not liquor that had driven him to this obvious desperation. His face, usually so rosy, was now strangely mottled.His hands trembled.

“Has anything happened？”I asked.

“My wife has left me.”

He could hardly get the words out. He gave a little gasp, and the tears began to trickle down his round cheeks.I did not know what to say.My frst thought was that she had come to the end of her forbearance with his infatuation for Strickland, and, goaded by the latter's cynical behaviour, had insisted that he should be turned out.I knew her capable of temper, for all the calmness of her manner；and if Stroeve still refused, she might easily have fung out of the studio with vows never to return.But the little man was so distressed that I could not smile.

“My dear fellow, don't be unhappy. She'll come back.You mustn't take very seriously what women say when they're in a passion.”

“You don't understand. She's in love with Strickland.”

“What！”I was startled at this, but the idea had no sooner taken possession of me than I saw it was absurd.“How can you be so silly？You don't mean to say you're jealous of Strickland？”I almost laughed.“You know very well that she can't bear the sight of him.”

“You don't understand，”he moaned.

“You're an hysterical ass，”I said a little impatiently.“Let me give you a whisky-and-soda, and you'll feel better.”

I supposed that for some reason or other-and Heaven knows what ingenuity men exercise to torment themselves-Dirk had got it into his head that his wife cared for Strickland, and with his genius for blundering he might quite well have offended her so that, to anger him, perhaps, she had taken pains to foster his suspicion.

“Look here，”I said，“let's go back to your studio. If you've made a fool of yourself you must eat humble pie.Your wife doesn't strike me as the sort of woman to bear malice.”

“How can I go back to the studio？”he said wearily.“They're there. I've left it to them.”

“Then it's not your wife who's left you；it's you who've left your wife.”

“For God's sake don't talk to me like that.”

Still I could not take him seriously. I did not for a moment believe what he had told me.But he was in very real distress.

“Well, you've come here to talk to me about it. You'd better tell me the whole story.”

“This afternoon I couldn't stand it any more. I went to Strickland and told him I thought he was quite well enough to go back to his own place.I wanted the studio myself.”

“No one but Strickland would have needed telling，”I said.“What did he say？”

“He laughed a little；you know how he laughs, not as though he were amused, but as though you were a damned fool, and said he'd go at once. He began to put his things together.You remember I fetched from his room what I thought he needed, and he asked Blanche for a piece of paper and some string to make a parcel.”

Stroeve stopped, gasping, and I thought he was going to faint. This was not at all the story I had expected him to tell me.

“She was very pale, but she brought the paper and the string. He didn't say anything.He made the parcel and he whistled a tune.He took no notice of either of us.His eyes had an ironic smile in them.My heart was like lead.I was afraid something was going to happen, and I wished I hadn't spoken.He looked round for his hat.Then she spoke：

“‘I'm going with Strickland, Dirk，'she said.‘I can't live with you any more.'

“I tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come. Strickland didn't say anything.He went on whistling as though it had nothing to do with him.”

Stroeve stopped again and mopped his face. I kept quite still.I believed him now, and I was astounded.But all the same I could not understand.

Then he told me, in a trembling voice, with the tears pouring down his cheeks, how he had gone up to her, trying to take her in his arms, but she had drawn away and begged him not to touch her. He implored her not to leave him.He told her how passionately he loved her, and reminded her of all the devotion he had lavished upon her.He spoke to her of the happiness of their life.He was not angry with her.He did not reproach her.

“Please let me go quietly, Dirk，”she said at last.“Don't you understand that I love Strickland？Where he goes I shall go.”

“But you must know that he'll never make you happy. For your own sake don't go.You don't know what you've got to look forward to.”

“It's your fault. You insisted on his coming here.”

He turned to Strickland.

“Have mercy on her，”he implored him.“You can't let her do anything so mad.”

“She can do as she chooses，”said Strickland.“She's not forced to come.”

“My choice is made，”she said, in a dull voice.

Strickland's injurious calm robbed Stroeve of the rest of his self-control. Blind rage seized him, and without knowing what he was doing he flung himself on Strickland.Strickland was taken by surprise and he staggered, but he was very strong, even after his illness, and in a moment, he did not exactly know how, Stroeve found himself on the foor.

“You funny little man，”said Strickland.

Stroeve picked himself up. He noticed that his wife had remained perfectly still, and to be made ridiculous before her increased his humiliation.His spectacles had tumbled off in the struggle, and he could not immediately see them.She picked them up and silently handed them to him.He seemed suddenly to realize his unhappiness, and though he knew he was making himself still more absurd, he began to cry.He hid his face in his hands.The others watched him without a word.They did not move from where they stood.

“Oh, my dear，”he groaned at last，“how can you be so cruel？”

“I can't help myself, Dirk，”she answered.

“I've worshipped you as no woman was ever worshipped before. If in anything I did I displeased you, why didn't you tell me, and I'd have changed.I've done everything I could for you.”

She did not answer. Her face was set, and he saw that he was only boring her.She put on a coat and her hat.She moved towards the door, and he saw that in a moment she would be gone.He went up to her quickly and fell on his knees before her, seizing her hands：he abandoned all self-respect.

“Oh, don't go, my darling. I can't live without you；I shall kill myself.If I've done anything to offend you I beg you to forgive me.Give me another chance.I'll try harder still to make you happy.”

“Get up, Dirk. You're making yourself a perfect fool.”

He staggered to his feet, but still he would not let her go.

“Where are you going？”he said hastily.“You don't know what Strickland's place is like. You can't live there.It would be awful.”

“If I don't care, I don't see why you should.”

“Stay a minute longer. I must speak.After all, you can't grudge me that.”

“What is the good？I've made up my mind. Nothing that you can say will make me alter it.”

He gulped, and put his hand to his heart to ease its painful beating.

“I'm not going to ask you to change your mind, but I want you to listen to me for a minute. It's the last thing I shall ever ask you.Don't refuse me that.”

She paused, looking at him with those reflective eyes of hers, which now were so indifferent to him. She came back into the studio and leaned against the table.

“Well？”

Stroeve made a great effort to collect himself.

“You must be a little reasonable. You can't live on air, you know.Strickland hasn't got a penny.”

“I know.”

“You'll suffer the most awful privations. You know why he took so long to get well.He was half starved.”

“I can earn money for him.”

“How？”

“I don't know. I shall fnd a way.”

A horrible thought passed through the Dutchman's mind, and he shuddered.

“I think you must be mad. I don't know what has come over you.”

She shrugged her shoulders.

“Now may I go？”

“Wait one second longer.”

He looked round his studio wearily；he had loved it because her presence had made it gay and home-like；he shut his eyes for an instant；then he gave her a long look as though to impress on his mind the picture of her. He got up and took his hat.

“No；I'll go.”

“You？”

She was startled. She did not know what he meant.

“I can't bear to think of you living in that horrible, filthy attic. After all, this is your home just as much as mine.You'll be comfortable here.You'll be spared at least the worst privations.”

He went to the drawer in which he kept his money and took out several bank-notes.

“I would like to give you half what I've got here.”

He put them on the table. Neither Strickland nor his wife spoke.

Then he recollected something else.

“Will you pack up my clothes and leave them with the concierge？I'll come and fetch them tomorrow.”He tried to smile.“Good-bye, my dear. I'm grateful for all the happiness you gave me in the past.”

He walked out and closed the door behind him. With my mind's eye I saw Strickland throw his hat on a table, and, sitting down, begin to smoke a cigarette.





Chapter XXIX


I kept silence for a little while, thinking of what Stroeve had told me. I could not stomach his weakness, and he saw my disapproval.

“You know as well as I do how Strickland lived，”he said tremulously.“I couldn't let her live in those circumstances-I simply couldn't.”

“That's your business，”I answered.

“What would you have done？”he asked.

“She went with her eyes open. If she had to put up with certain inconveniences it was her own look-out.”

“Yes；but, you see, you don't love her.”

“Do you love her still？”

“Oh, more than ever. Strickland isn't the man to make a woman happy.It can't last.I want her to know that I shall never fail her.”

“Does that mean that you're prepared to take her back？”

“I shouldn't hesitate. Why, she'll want me more than ever then.When she's alone and humiliated and broken it would be dreadful if she had nowhere to go.”

He seemed to bear no resentment. I suppose it was commonplace in me that I felt slightly outraged at his lack of spirit.Perhaps he guessed what was in my mind, for he said：

“I couldn't expect her to love me as I loved her. I'm a buffoon.I'm not the sort of man that women love.I've always known that.I can't blame her if she’s fallen in love with Strickland.”

“You certainly have less vanity than any man I've ever known，”I said.

“I love her so much better than myself. It seems to me that when vanity comes into love it can only be because really you love yourself best.After all, it constantly happens that a man when he's married falls in love with somebody else；when he gets over it he returns to his wife, and she takes him back, and everyone thinks it very natural.Why should it be different with women？”

“I dare say that's logical，”I smiled，“but most men are made differently, and they can't.”

But while I talked to Stroeve I was puzzling over the suddenness of the whole affair. I could not imagine that he had had no warning.I remembered the curious look I had seen in Blanche Stroeve's eyes；perhaps its explanation was that she was growing dimly conscious of a feeling in her heart that surprised and alarmed her.

“Did you have no suspicion before today that there was anything between them？”I asked.

He did not answer for a while. There was a pencil on the table, and unconsciously he drew a head on the blotting-paper.

“Please say so, if you hate my asking you questions，”I said.

“It eases me to talk. Oh, if you knew the frightful anguish in my heart.”He threw the pencil down.“Yes, I've known it for a fortnight.I knew it before she did.”

“Why on earth didn't you send Strickland packing？”

“I couldn't believe it. It seemed so improbable.She couldn't bear the sight of him.It was more than improbable；it was incredible.I thought it was merely jealousy.You see, I've always been jealous, but I trained myself never to show it；I was jealous of every man she knew；I was jealous of you.I knew she didn't love me as I loved her.That was only natural, wasn't it？But she allowed me to love her, and that was enough to make me happy.I forced myself to go out for hours together in order to leave them by themselves；I wanted to punish myself for suspicions which were unworthy of me；and when I came back I found they didn’t want me-not Strickland, he didn’t care if I was there or not, but Blanche.She shuddered when I went to kiss her.When at last I was certain I didn’t know what to do；I knew they’d only laugh at me if I made a scene.I thought if I held my tongue and pretended not to see, everything would come right.I made up my mind to get him away quietly, without quarrelling.Oh, if you only knew what I’ve suffered！”

Then he told me again of his asking Strickland to go. He chose his moment carefully, and tried to make his request sound casual；but he could not master the trembling of his voice, and he felt himself that into words that he wished to seem jovial and friendly there crept the bitterness of his jealousy.He had not expected Strickland to take him up on the spot and make his preparations to go there and then；above all, he had not expected his wife's decision to go with him.I saw that now he wished with all his heart that he had held his tongue.He preferred the anguish of jealousy to the anguish of separation.

“I wanted to kill him, and I only made a fool of myself.”

He was silent for a long time, and then he said what I knew was in his mind.

“If I'd only waited, perhaps it would have gone all right. I shouldn't have been so impatient.Oh, poor child, what have I driven her to？”

I shrugged my shoulders, but did not speak. I had no sympathy for Blanche Stroeve, but knew that it would only pain poor Dirk if I told him exactly what I thought of her.

He had reached that stage of exhaustion when he could not stop talking. He went over again every word of the scene.Now something occurred to him that he had not told me before；now he discussed what he ought to have said instead of what he did say；then he lamented his blindness.He regretted that he had done this, and blamed himself that he had omitted the other.It grew later and later, and at last I was as tired as he.

“What are you going to do now？”I said fnally.

“What can I do？I shall wait till she sends for me.”

“Why don't you go away for a bit？”

“No, no；I must be at hand when she wants me.”

For the present he seemed quite lost. He had made no plans.When I suggested that he should go to bed he said he could not sleep；he wanted to go out and walk about the streets till day.He was evidently in no state to be left alone.I persuaded him to stay the night with me, and I put him into my own bed.I had a divan in my sitting-room, and could very well sleep on that.He was by now so worn out that he could not resist my frmness.I gave him a suffcient dose of veronal to ensure his unconsciousness for several hours.I thought that was the best service I could render him.





Chapter XXX


But the bed I made up for myself was suffciently uncomfortable to give me a wakeful night, and I thought a good deal of what the unlucky Dutchman had told me. I was not so much puzzled by Blanche Stroeve's action, for I saw in that merely the result of a physical appeal.I do not suppose she had ever really cared for her husband, and what I had taken for love was no more than the feminine response to caresses and comfort which in the minds of most women passes for it.It is a passive feeling capable of being roused for any object, as the vine can grow on any tree；and the wisdom of the world recognizes its strength when it urges a girl to marry the man who wants her with the assurance that love will follow.It is an emotion made up of the satisfaction in security, pride of property, the pleasure of being desired, the gratification of a household, and it is only by an amiable vanity that women ascribe to its spiritual value.It is an emotion which is defenceless against passion.I suspected that Blanche Stroeve's violent dislike of Strickland had in it from the beginning a vague element of sexual attraction.Who am I that I should seek to unravel the mysterious intricacies of sex？Perhaps Stroeve's passion excited without satisfying that part of her nature, and she hated Strickland because she felt in him the power to give her what she needed.I think she was quite sincere when she struggled against her husband's desire to bring him into the studio；I think she was frightened of him, though she knew not why；and I remembered how she had foreseen disaster.I think in some curious way the horror which she felt for him was a transference of the horror which she felt for herself because he so strangely troubled her.His appearance was wild and uncouth；there was aloofness in his eyes and sensuality in his mouth；he was big and strong；he gave the impression of untamed passion；and perhaps she felt in him, too, that sinister element which had made me think of those wild beings of the world's early history when matter, retaining its early connexion with the earth, seemed to possess yet a spirit of its own.If he affected her at all, it was inevitable that she should love or hate him.She hated him.

And then I fancy that the daily intimacy with the sick man moved her strangely. She raised his head to give him food, and it was heavy against her hand；when she fed him she wiped his sensual mouth and his red beard.She washed his limbs；they were covered with thick hair；and when she dried his hands, even in his weakness they were strong and sinewy.His fngers were long；they were the capable, fashioning fngers of the artist；and I know not what troubling thoughts they excited in her.He slept very quietly, without a movement, so that he might have been dead, and he was like some wild creature of the woods, resting after a long chase；and she wondered what fancies passed through his dreams.Did he dream of the nymph fying through the woods of Greece with the satyr in hot pursuit？She fed, swift of foot and desperate, but he gained on her step by step, till she felt his hot breath on her chee；and still she fed silently, and silently he pursued, and when at last he seized her was it terror that thrilled her heart or was it ecstasy？

Blanche Stroeve was in the cruel grip of appetite. Perhaps she hated Strickland still, but she hungered for him, and everything that had made up her life till then became of no account.She ceased to be a woman, complex, kind, and petulant, considerate and thoughtless；she was a Maenad.She was desire.

But perhaps this is very fanciful；and it may be that she was merely bored with her husband and went to Strickland out of a callous curiosity. She may have had no particular feeling for him, but succumbed to his wish from propinquity or idleness, to fnd then that she was powerless in a snare of her own contriving.How did I know what were the thoughts and emotions behind that placid brow and those cool grey eyes？

But if one could be certain of nothing in dealing with creatures so incalculable as human beings, there were explanations of Blanche Stroeve's behaviour which were at all events plausible. On the other hand, I did not understand Strickland at all.I racked my brain, but could in no way account for an action so contrary to my conception of him.It was not strange that he should so heartlessly have betrayed his friends'confdence, nor that he hesitated not at all to gratify a whim at the cost of another's misery.That was in his character.He was a man without any conception of gratitude.He had no compassion.The emotions common to most of us simply did not exist in him, and it was as absurd to blame him for not feeling them as for blaming the tiger because he is ferce and cruel.But it was the whim I could not understand.

I could not believe that Strickland had fallen in love with Blanche Stroeve. I did not believe him capable of love.That is an emotion in which tenderness is an essential part, but Strickland had no tenderness either for himself or for others；there is in love a sense of weakness, a desire to protect, and eagerness to do good and to give pleasure—if not unselfishness, at all events a selfishness which marvellously conceals itself；it has in it a certain diffidence.These were not traits which I could imagine in Strickland.Love is absorbing；it takes the lover out of himself；the most clearsighted, though he may know, cannot realize that this love will cease；it gives body to what he knows is illusion, and, knowing it is nothing else, he loves it better than reality.It makes a man a little more than himself, and at the same time a little less.He ceases to be himself.He is no longer an individual, but a thing, an instrument to some purpose foreign to his ego.Love is never quite devoid of sentimentality, and Strickland was the least inclined to that infrmity of any man I have known.I could not believe that he would ever suffer that possession of himself which love is；he could never endure a foreign yoke.I believed him capable of uprooting from his heart, though it might be with agony, so that he was left battered and ensanguined, anything that came between himself and that uncomprehended craving that urged him constantly to he knew not what.If I have succeeded at all in giving the complicated impression that Strickland made on me, it will not seem outrageous to say that I felt he was at once too great and too small for love.

But I suppose that everyone's conception of the passion is formed on his own idiosyncrasies, and it is different with every different person. A man like Strickland would love in a manner peculiar to himself.It was vain to seek the analysis of his emotion.





Chapter XXXI


Next day, though I pressed him to remain, Stroeve left me. I offered to fetch his things from the studio, but he insisted on going himself；I think he hoped they had not thought of getting them together, so that he would have an opportunity of seeing his wife again and perhaps inducing her to come back to him.But he found his traps waiting for him in the porter's lodge, and the concierge told him that Blanche had gone out.I do not think he resisted the temptation of giving her an account of his troubles.I found that he was telling them to everyone he knew；he expected sympathy, but only excited ridicule.

He bore himself most unbecomingly. Knowing at what time his wife did her shopping, one day, unable any longer to bear not seeing her, he waylaid her in the street.She would not speak to him, but he insisted on speaking to her.He spluttered out words of apology for any wrong he had committed towards her；he told her he loved her devotedly and begged her to return to him.She would not answer；she walked hurriedly, with averted face.I imagined him with his fat little legs trying to keep up with her.Panting a little in his haste, he told her how miserable he was；he besought her to have mercy on him；he promised, if she would forgive him, to do everything she wanted.He offered to take her for a journey.He told her that Strickland would soon tire of her.When he repeated to me the whole sordid little scene I was outraged.He had shown neither sense nor dignity.He had omitted nothing that could make his wife despise him.There is no cruelty greater than a woman's to a man who loves her and whom she does not love；she has no kindness then, no tolerance even, she has only an insane irritation.Blanche Stroeve stopped suddenly, and as hard as she could slapped her husband's face.She took advantage of his confusion to escape, and ran up the stairs to the studio.No word had passed her lips.

When he told me this he put his hand to his cheek as though he still felt the smart of the blow, and in his eyes was a pain that was heartrending and an amazement that was ludicrous. He looked like an overblown schoolboy, and though I felt so sorry for him, I could hardly help laughing.

Then he took to walking along the street which she must pass through to get to the shops, and he would stand at the corner, on the other side, as she went along. He dared not speak to her again, but sought to put into his round eyes the appeal that was in his heart.I suppose he had some idea that the sight of his misery would touch her.She never made the smallest sign that she saw him.She never even changed the hour of her errands or sought an alternative route.I have an idea that there was some cruelty in her indifference.Perhaps she got enjoyment out of the torture she inflicted.I wondered why she hated him so much.

I begged Stroeve to behave more wisely. His want of spirit was exasperating.

“You're doing no good at all by going on like this，”I said.“I think you'd have been wiser if you'd hit her over the head with a stick. She wouldn't have despised you as she does now.”

I suggested that he should go home for a while. He had often spoken to me of the silent town, somewhere up in the north of Holland, where his parents still lived.They were poor people.His father was a carpenter, and they dwelt in a little old red-brick house, neat and clean, by the side of a sluggish canal.The streets were wide and empty；for two hundred years the place had been dying, but the houses had the homely stateliness of their time.Rich merchants, sending their wares to the distant Indies, had lived in them calm and prosperous lives, and in their decent decay they kept still an aroma of their splendid past.You could wander along the canal till you came to broad green felds, with windmills here and there, in which cattle, black and white, grazed lazily.I thought that among those surroundings, with their recollections of his boyhood, Dirk Stroeve would forget his unhappiness.But he would not go.

“I must be here when she needs me，”he repeated.“It would be dreadful if something terrible happened and I were not at hand.”

“What do you think is going to happen？”I asked.

“I don't know. But I'm afraid.”

I shrugged my shoulders.

For all his pain, Dirk Stroeve remained a ridiculous object. He might have excited sympathy if he had grown worn and thin.He did nothing of the kind.He remained fat, and his round red cheeks shone like ripe apples.He had great neatness of person, and he continued to wear his spruce black coat and his bowler hat, always a little too small for him, in a dapper, jaunty manner.He was getting something of a paunch, and sorrow had no effect on it.He looked more than ever like a prosperous bagman.It is hard that a man's exterior should tally so little sometimes with his soul.Dirk Stroeve had the passion of Romeo in the body of Sir Toby Belch.He had a sweet and generous nature, and yet was always blundering；a real feeling for what was beautiful and the capacity to create only what was commonplace；a peculiar delicacy of sentiment and gross manners.He could exercise tact when dealing with the affairs of others, but none when dealing with his own.What a cruel practical joke old Nature played when she fung so many contradictory elements together, and left the man face to face with the perplexing callousness of the universe.





Chapter XXXII


I did not see Strickland for several weeks. I was disgusted with him, and if I had had an opportunity should have been glad to tell him so, but I saw no object in seeking him out for the purpose.I am a little shy of any assumption of moral indignation.There is always in it an element of self-satisfaction which makes it awkward to anyone who has a sense of humour.It requires a very lively passion to steel me to my own ridicule.There was a sardonic sincerity in Strickland which made me sensitive to anything that might suggest a pose.

But one evening, when I was passing along the Avenue de Clichy in front of the café which Strickland frequented and which I now avoided, I ran straight into him.He was accompanied by Blanche Stroeve, and they were just going to Strickland’s favourite corner.

“Where the devil have you been all this time？”said he.“I thought you must be away.”

His cordiality was proof that he knew I had no wish to speak to him. He was not a man with whom it was worth while wasting politeness.

“No，”I said；“I haven't been away.”

“Why haven't you been here？”

“There are more cafés in Paris than one, at which to trife away an idle hour.”

Blanche then held out her hand and bade me good evening. I do not know why I had expected her to be somehow changed；she wore the same grey dress that she wore so often, neat and becoming, and her brow was as candid, her eyes as untroubled, as when I had been used to see her occupied with her household duties in the studio.

“Come and have a game of chess，”said Strickland.

I do not know why at the moment I could think of no excuse. I followed them rather sulkily to the table at which Strickland always sat, and he called for the board and the chessmen.They both took the situation so much as a matter of course that I felt it absurd to do otherwise.Mrs.Stroeve watched the game with inscrutable face.She was silent, but she had always been silent.I looked at her mouth for an expression that could give me a clue to what she felt；I watched her eyes for some tell-tale fash, some hint of dismay or bitterness；I scanned her brow for any passing line that might indicate a settling emotion.Her face was a mask that told nothing.Her hands lay on her lap motionless, one in the other loosely clasped.I knew from what I had heard that she was a woman of violent passions；and that injurious blow that she had given Dirk, the man who had loved her so devotedly, betrayed a sudden temper and a horrid cruelty.She had abandoned the safe shelter of her husband's protection and the comfortable ease of a well-provided establishment for what she could not but see was an extreme hazard.It showed an eagerness for adventure, a readiness for the hand-to-mouth, which the care she took of her home and her love of good housewifery made not a little remarkable.She must be a woman of complicated character, and there was something dramatic in the contrast of that with her demure appearance.

I was excited by the encounter, and my fancy worked busily while I sought to concentrate myself on the game I was playing. I always tried my best to beat Strickland, because he was a player who despised the opponent he vanquished；his exultation in victory made defeat more difficult to bear.On the other hand, if he was beaten he took it with complete good humour.He was a bad winner and a good loser.Those who think that a man betrays his character nowhere more clearly than when he is playing a game might on this draw subtle inferences.

When he had fnished I called the waiter to pay for the drinks, and left them. The meeting had been devoid of incident.No word had been said to give me anything to think about, and any surmises I might make were unwarranted.I was intrigued.I could not tell how they were getting on.I would have given much to be a disembodied spirit so that I could see them in the privacy of the studio and hear what they talked about.I had not the smallest indication on which to let my imagination work.





Chapter XXXIII


Two or three days later Dirk Stroeve called on me.

“I hear you've seen Blanche，”he said.

“How on earth did you fnd out？”

“I was told by someone who saw you sitting with them. Why didn't you tell me？”

“I thought it would only pain you.”

“What do I care if it does？You must know that I want to hear the smallest thing about her.”

I waited for him to ask me questions.

“What does she look like？”he said.

“Absolutely unchanged.”

“Does she seem happy？”

I shrugged my shoulders.

“How can I tell？We were in a café；we were playing chess；I had no opportunity to speak to her.”

“Oh, but couldn't you tell by her face？”

I shook my head. I could only repeat that by no word, by no hinted gesture, had she given an indication of her feelings.He must know better than I how great were her powers of self-control.He clasped his hands emotionally.

“Oh, I'm so frightened. I know something is going to happen, something terrible, and I can do nothing to stop it.”

“What sort of thing？”I asked.

“Oh, I don't know，”he moaned, seizing his head with his hands.“I foresee some terrible catastrophe.”

Stroeve had always been excitable, but now he was beside himself；there was no reasoning with him. I thought it probable enough that Blanche Stroeve would not continue to find life with Strickland tolerable, but one of the falsest of proverbs is that you must lie on the bed that you have made.The experience of life shows that people are constantly doing things which must lead to disaster, and yet by some chance manage to evade the result of their folly.When Blanche quarrelled with Strickland she had only to leave him, and her husband was waiting humbly to forgive and forget.I was not prepared to feel any great sympathy for her.

“You see, you don't love her，”said Stroeve.

“After all, there's nothing to prove that she is unhappy. For all we know they may have settled down into a most domestic couple.”

Stroeve gave me a look with his woeful eyes.

“Of course, it doesn't much matter to you, but to me it's so serious, so intensely serious.”

I was sorry if I had seemed impatient or fippant.

“Will you do something for me？”asked Stroeve.

“Willingly.”

“Will you write to Blanche for me？”

“Why can't you write yourself？”

“I've written over and over again. I didn't expect her to answer.I don't think she reads the letters.”

“You make no account of feminine curiosity. Do you think she could resist？”

“She could-mine.”

I looked at him quickly. He lowered his eyes.That answer of his seemed to me strangely humiliating.He was conscious that she regarded him with an indifference so profound that the sight of his handwriting would have not the slightest effect on her.

“Do you really believe that she'll ever come back to you？”I asked.

“I want her to know that if the worst comes to the worst she can count on me. That's what I want you to tell her.”

I took a sheet of paper.

“What is it exactly you wish me to say？”

This is what I wrote：

Dear Mrs. Stroeve，

Dirk wishes me to tell you that if at any time you want him he will be grateful for the opportunity of being of service to you.He has no ill-feeling towards you on account of anything that has happened.His love for you is unaltered.You will always fnd him at the following address.





Chapter XXXIV


But though I was no less convinced than Stroeve that the connexion between Strickland and Blanche would end disastrously, I did not expect the issue to take the tragic form it did. The summer came, breathless and sultry, and even at night there was no coolness to rest one's jaded nerves.The sun-baked streets seemed to give back the heat that had beat down on them during the day, and the passers-by dragged their feet along them wearily.I had not seen Strickland for weeks.Occupied with other things, I had ceased to think of him and his affairs.Dirk, with his vain lamentations, had begun to bore me, and I avoided his society.It was a sordid business, and I was not inclined to trouble myself with it further.

One morning I was working. I sat in my pyjamas.My thoughts wandered, and I thought of the sunny beaches of Brittany and the freshness of the sea.By my side was the empty bowl in which the concierge had brought me my café au lait and the fragment of croissant which I had not had appetite enough to eat.I heard the concierge in the next room emptying my bath.There was a tinkle at my bell, and I left her to open the door.In a moment I heard Stroeve’s voice asking if I was in.Without moving, I shouted to him to come.He entered the room quickly, and came up to the table at which I sat.

“She's killed herself，”he said hoarsely.

“What do you mean？”I cried, startled.

He made movements with his lips as though he were speaking, but no sound issued from them. He gibbered like an idiot.My heart thumped against my ribs, and, I do not know why, I few into a temper.

“For God's sake, collect yourself, man，”I said.“What on earth are you talking about？”

He made despairing gestures with his hands, but still no words came from his mouth. He might have been struck dumb.I do not know what came over me；I took him by the shoulders and shook him.Looking back, I am vexed that I made such a fool of myself；I suppose the last restless nights had shaken my nerves more than I knew.

“Let me sit down，”he gasped at length.

I flled a glass with St. Galmier, and gave it to him to drink.I held it to his mouth as though he were a child.He gulped down a mouthful, and some of it was spilt on his shirt-front.

“Who's killed herself？”

I do not know why I asked, for I knew whom he meant. He made an effort to collect himself.

“They had a row last night. He went away.”

“Is she dead？”

“No；they've taken her to the hospital.”

“Then what are you talking about？”I cried impatiently.“Why did you say she'd killed herself？”

“Don't be cross with me. I can't tell you anything if you talk to me like that.”

I clenched my hands, seeking to control my irritation. I attempted to smile.

“I'm sorry. Take your time.Don't hurry, there's a good fellow.”

His round blue eyes behind the spectacles were ghastly with terror. The magnifying glasses he wore distorted them.

“When the concierge went up this morning to take a letter she could get no answer to her ring. She heard someone groaning.The door wasn't locked, and she went in.Blanche was lying on the bed.She'd been frightfully sick.There was a bottle of oxalic acid on the table.”

Stroeve hid his face in his hands and swayed backwards and forwards, groaning.

“Was she conscious？”

“Yes. Oh, if you knew how she's suffering.I can't bear it.I can't bear it.”

His voice rose to a shriek.

“Damn it all, you haven't got to bear it，”I cried impatiently.“She's got to bear it.”

“How can you be so cruel？”

“What have you done？”

“They sent for a doctor and for me, and they told the police. I'd given the concierge twenty francs, and told her to send for me if anything happened.”

He paused a minute, and I saw that what he had to tell me was very hard to say.

“When I went she wouldn't speak to me. She told them to send me away.I swore that I forgave her everything, but she wouldn't listen.She tried to beat her head against the wall.The doctor told me that I mustn't remain with her.She kept on saying，‘Send him away！'I went, and waited in the studio.And when the ambulance came and they put her on a stretcher, they made me go in the kitchen so that she shouldn't know I was there.”

While I dressed-for Stroeve wished me to go at once with him to the hospital-he told me that he had arranged for his wife to have a private room, so that she might at least be spared the sordid promiscuity of a ward. On our way he explained to me why he desired my presence；if she still refused to see him, perhaps she would see me.He begged me to repeat to her that he loved her still；he would reproach her for nothing, but desired only to help her；he made no claim on her, and on her recovery would not seek to induce her to return to him；she would be perfectly free.

But when we arrived at the hospital, a gaunt, cheerless building, the mere sight of which was enough to make one's heart sick, and after being directed from this offcial to that, up endless stairs and through long bare corridors, found the doctor in charge of the case, we were told that the patient was too ill to see anyone that day. The doctor was a little bearded man in white, with an off-hand manner.He evidently looked upon a case as a case, and anxious relatives as a nuisance which must be treated with frmness.Moreover, to him the affair was commonplace；it was just a hysterical woman who had quarrelled with her lover and taken poison；it was constantly happening.At frst he thought that Dirk was the cause of the disaster, and he was needlessly brusque with him.When I explained that he was the husband, anxious to forgive, the doctor looked at him suddenly, with curious, searching eyes.I seemed to see in them a hint of mockery；it was true that Stroeve had the head of the husband who is deceived.The doctor faintly shrugged his shoulders.

“There is no immediate danger，”he said, in answer to our questioning.“One doesn't know how much she took. It may be that she will get off with a fright.Women are constantly trying to commit suicide for love, but generally they take care not to succeed.It's generally a gesture to arouse pity or terror in their lover.”

There was in his tone a frigid contempt. It was obvious that to him Blanche Stroeve was only a unit to be added to the statistical list of attempted suicides in the city of Paris during the current year.He was busy, and could waste no more time on us.He told us that if we came at a certain hour next day, should Blanche be better, it might be possible for her husband to see her.





Chapter XXXV


I scarcely know how we got through that day. Stroeve could not bear to be alone, and I exhausted myself in efforts to distract him.I took him to the Louvre, and he pretended to look at pictures, but I saw that his thoughts were constantly with his wife.I forced him to eat, and after luncheon I induced him to lie down, but he could not sleep.He accepted willingly my invitation to remain for a few days in my apartment.I gave him books to read, but after a page or two he would put the book down and stare miserably into space.During the evening we played innumerable games of piquet, and bravely, not to disappoint my efforts, he tried to appear interested.Finally I gave him a draught, and he sank into uneasy slumber.

When we went again to the hospital we saw a nursing sister. She told us that Blanche seemed a little better, and she went in to ask if she would see her husband.We heard voices in the room in which she lay, and presently the nurse returned to say that the patient refused to see anyone.We had told her that if she refused to see Dirk the nurse was to ask if she would see me, but this she refused also.Dirk's lips trembled.

“I dare not insist，”said the nurse.“She is too ill. Perhaps in a day or two she may change her mind.”

“Is there anyone else she wants to see？”asked Dirk, in a voice so low it was almost a whisper.

“She says she only wants to be left in peace.”

Dirk's hands moved strangely, as though they had nothing to do with his body, with a movement of their own.

“Will you tell her that if there is anyone else she wishes to see I will bring him？I only want her to be happy.”

The nurse looked at him with her calm, kind eyes, which had seen all the horror and pain of the world, and yet, flled with the vision of a world without sin, remained serene.

“I will tell her when she is a little calmer.”

Dirk, filled with compassion, begged her to take the message at once.

“It may cure her. I beseech you to ask her now.”

With a faint smile of pity, the nurse went back into the room. We heard her low voice, and then, in a voice I did not recognize, the answer：

“No. No.No.”

The nurse came out again and shook her head.

“Was that she who spoke then？”I asked.“Her voice sounded so strange.”

“It appears that her vocal cords have been burnt by the acid.”

Dirk gave a low cry of distress. I asked him to go on and wait for me at the entrance, for I wanted to say something to the nurse.He did not ask what it was, but went silently.He seemed to have lost all power of will；he was like an obedient child.

“Has she told you why she did it？”I asked.

“No. She won't speak.She lies on her back quite quietly.She doesn't move for hours at a time.But she cries always.Her pillow is all wet.She's too weak to use a handkerchief, and the tears just run down her face.”

It gave me a sudden wrench of the heart-strings. I could have killed Strickland then, and I knew that my voice was trembling when I bade the nurse good-bye.

I found Dirk waiting for me on the steps. He seemed to see nothing, and did not notice that I had joined him till I touched him on the arm.We walked along in silence.I tried to imagine what had happened to drive the poor creature to that dreadful step.I presumed that Strickland knew what had happened, for someone must have been to see him from the police, and he must have made his statement.I did not know where he was.I supposed he had gone back to the shabby attic which served him as a studio.It was curious that she should not wish to see him.Perhaps she refused to have him sent for because she knew he would refuse to come.I wondered what an abyss of cruelty she must have looked into that in horror she refused to live.





Chapter XXXVI


The next week was dreadful. Stroeve went twice a day to the hospital to inquire after his wife, who still declined to see him；and came away at frst relieved and hopeful because he was told that she seemed to be growing better, and then in despair because, the complication which the doctor had feared having ensued, recovery was impossible.The nurse was pitiful to his distress, but she had little to say that could console him.The poor woman lay quite still, refusing to speak, with her eyes intent, as though she watched for the coming of death.It could now be only the question of a day or two；and when, late one evening, Stroeve came to see me I knew it was to tell me she was dead.He was absolutely exhausted.His volubility had left him at last, and he sank down wearily on my sofa.I felt that no words of condolence availed, and I let him lie there quietly.I feared he would think it heartless if I read, so I sat by the window, smoking a pipe, till he felt inclined to speak.

“You've been very kind to me，”he said at last.“Everyone's been very kind.”

“Nonsense，”I said, a little embarrassed.

“At the hospital they told me I might wait. They gave me a chair, and I sat outside the door.When she became unconscious they said I might go in.Her mouth and chin were all burnt by the acid.It was awful to see her lovely skin all wounded.She died very peacefully, so that I didn't know she was dead till the sister told me.”

He was too tired to weep. He lay on his back limply, as though all the strength had gone out of his limbs, and presently I saw that he had fallen asleep.It was the frst natural sleep he had had for a week.Nature, sometimes so cruel, is sometimes merciful.I covered him and turned down the light.In the morning when I awoke he was still asleep.He had not moved.His gold-rimmed spectacles were still on his nose.





Chapter XXXVII


The circumstances of Blanche Stroeve's death necessitated all manner of dreadful formalities, but at last we were allowed to bury her. Dirk and I alone followed the hearse to the cemetery.We went at a foot-pace, but on the way back we trotted, and there was something to my mind singularly horrible in the way the driver of the hearse whipped up his horses.It seemed to dismiss the dead with a shrug of the shoulders.Now and then I caught sight of the swaying hearse in front of us, and our own driver urged his pair so that we might not remain behind.I felt in myself, too, the desire to get the whole thing out of my mind.I was beginning to be bored with a tragedy that did not really concern me, and pretending to myself that I spoke in order to distract Stroeve, I turned with relief to other subjects.

“Don't you think you'd better go away for a bit？”I said.“There can be no object in your staying in Paris now.”

He did not answer, but I went on ruthlessly：

“Have you made any plans for the immediate future？”

“No.”

“You must try and gather together the threads again. Why don't you go down to Italy and start working？”

Again he made no reply, but the driver of our carriage came to my rescue. Slackening his pace for a moment, he leaned over and spoke.I could not hear what he said, so I put my head out of the window；he wanted to know where we wished to be set down.I told him to wait a minute.

“You'd better come and have lunch with me，”I said to Dirk.“I'll tell him to drop us in the Place Pigalle.”

“I'd rather not. I want to go to the studio.”

I hesitated a moment.

“Would you like me to come with you？”I asked then.

“No；I should prefer to be alone.”

“All right.”

I gave the driver the necessary direction, and in renewed silence we drove on. Dirk had not been to the studio since the wretched morning on which they had taken Blanche to the hospital.I was glad he did not want me to accompany him, and when I left him at the door I walked away with relief.I took a new pleasure in the streets of Paris, and I looked with smiling eyes at the people who hurried to and fro.The day was fne and sunny, and I felt in myself a more acute delight in life.I could not help it；I put Stroeve and his sorrows out of my mind.I wanted to enjoy.





Chapter XXXVIII


I did not see him again for nearly a week. Then he fetched me soon after seven one evening and took me out to dinner.He was dressed in the deepest mourning, and on his bowler was a broad black band.He had even a black border to his handkerchief.His garb of woe suggested that he had lost in one catastrophe every relation he had in the world, even to cousins by marriage twice removed.His plumpness and his red, fat cheeks made his mourning not a little incongruous.It was cruel that his extreme unhappiness should have in it something of buffoonery.

He told me he had made up his mind to go away, though not to Italy, as I had suggested, but to Holland.

“I'm starting tomorrow. This is perhaps the last time we shall ever meet.”

I made an appropriate rejoinder, and he smiled wanly.

“I haven't been home for fve years. I think I'd forgotten it all；I seemed to have come so far away from my father's house that I was shy at the idea of revisiting it；but now I feel it's my only refuge.”

He was sore and bruised, and his thoughts went back to the tenderness of his mother's love. The ridicule he had endured for years seemed now to weigh him down, and the final blow of Blanche's treachery had robbed him of the resiliency which had made him take it so gaily.He could no longer laugh with those who laughed at him.He was an outcast.He told me of his childhood in the tidy brick house, and of his mother's passionate orderliness.Her kitchen was a miracle of clean brightness.Everything was always in its place, and nowhere could you see a speck of dust.Cleanliness, indeed, was a mania with her.I saw a neat little old woman, with cheeks like apples, toiling away from morning to night, through the long years, to keep her house trim and spruce.His father was a spare old man, his hands gnarled after the work of a lifetime, silent and upright；in the evening he read the paper aloud, while his wife and daughter（now married to the captain of a fishing smack），unwilling to lose a moment, bent over their sewing.Nothing ever happened in that little town, left behind by the advance of civilization, and one year followed the next till death came, like a friend, to give rest to those who had laboured so diligently.

“My father wished me to become a carpenter like himself. For five generations we've carried on the same trade, from father to son.Perhaps that is the wisdom of life, to tread in your father's steps, and look neither to the right nor to the left.When I was a little boy I said I would marry the daughter of the harness-maker who lived next door.She was a little girl with blue eyes and a faxen pigtail.She would have kept my house like a new pin, and I should have had a son to carry on the business after me.”

Stroeve sighed a little and was silent. His thoughts dwelt among pictures of what might have been, and the safety of the life he had refused flled him with longing.

“The world is hard and cruel. We are here none knows why, and we go none knows whither.We must be very humble.We must see the beauty of quietness.We must go through life so inconspicuously that Fate does not notice us.And let us seek the love of simple, ignorant people.Their ignorance is better than all our knowledge.Let us be silent, content in our little corner, meek and gentle like them.That is the wisdom of life.”

To me it was his broken spirit that expressed itself, and I rebelled against his renunciation. But I kept my own counsel.

“What made you think of being a painter？”I asked.

He shrugged his shoulders.

“It happened that I had a knack for drawing. I got prizes for it at school.My poor mother was very proud of my gift, and she gave me a box of water-colours as a present.She showed my sketches to the pastor and the doctor and the judge.They sent me to Amsterdam to try for a scholarship, and I won it.Poor soul, she was so proud；and though it nearly broke her heart to part from me, she smiled, and would not show me her grief.She was pleased that her son should be an artist.They pinched and saved so that I should have enough to live on, and when my first picture was exhibited they came to Amsterdam to see it, my father and mother and my sister, and my mother cried when she looked at it.”His kind eyes glistened.“And now on every wall of the old house there is one of my pictures in a beautiful gold frame.”

He glowed with happy pride. I thought of those cold scenes of his, with their picturesque peasants and cypresses and olive-trees.They must look queer in their garish frames on the walls of the peasant house.

“The dear soul thought she was doing a wonderful thing for me when she made me an artist, but perhaps, after all, it would have been better for me if my father's will had prevailed and I were now but an honest carpenter.”

“Now that you know what art can offer, would you change your life？Would you have missed all the delight it has given you？”

“Art is the greatest thing in the world，”he answered, after a pause.

He looked at me for a minute refectively；he seemed to hesitate；then he said：

“Did you know that I had been to see Strickland？”

“You？”

I was astonished. I should have thought he could not bear to set eyes on him.Stroeve smiled faintly.

“You know already that I have no proper pride.”

“What do you mean by that？”

He told me a singular story.





Chapter XXXIX


When I left him, after we had buried poor Blanche, Stroeve walked into the house with a heavy heart. Something impelled him to go to the studio, some obscure desire for self-torture, and yet he dreaded the anguish that he foresaw.He dragged himself up the stairs；his feet seemed unwilling to carry him；and outside the door he lingered for a long time, trying to summon up courage to go in.He felt horribly sick.He had an impulse to run down the stairs after me and beg me to go in with him；he had a feeling that there was somebody in the studio.He remembered how often he had waited for a minute or two on the landing to get his breath after the ascent, and how absurdly his impatience to see Blanche had taken it away again.To see her was a delight that never staled, and even though he had not been out an hour he was as excited at the prospect as if they had been parted for a month.Suddenly he could not believe that she was dead.What had happened could only be a dream, a frightful dream；and when he turned the key and opened the door, he would see her bending slightly over the table in the gracious attitude of the woman in Chardin's Benedicite, which always seemed to him so exquisite.Hurriedly he took the key out of his pocket, opened, and walked in.

The apartment had no look of desertion. His wife's tidiness was one of the traits which had so much pleased him；his own upbringing had given him a tender sympathy for the delight in orderliness；and when he had seen her instinctive desire to put each thing in its appointed place it had given him a little warm feeling in his heart.The bedroom looked as though she had just left it：the brushes were neatly placed on the toilet-table, one on each side of the comb；someone had smoothed down the bed on which she had spent her last night in the studio, and her nightdress in a little case lay on the pillow.It was impossible to believe that she would never come into that room again.

But he felt thirsty, and went into the kitchen to get himself some water. Here, too, was order.On a rack were the plates that she had used for dinner on the night of her quarrel with Strickland, and they had been carefully washed.The knives and forks were put away in a drawer.Under a cover were the remains of a piece of cheese, and in a tin box was a crust of bread.She had done her marketing from day to day, buying only what was strictly needful, so that nothing was left over from one day to the next.Stroeve knew from the inquiries made by the police that Strickland had walked out of the house immediately after dinner, and the fact that Blanche had washed up the things as usual gave him a little thrill of horror.Her methodicalness made her suicide more deliberate.Her self-possession was frightening.A sudden pang seized him, and his knees felt so weak that he almost fell.He went back into the bedroom and threw himself on the bed.He cried out her name：

“Blanche. Blanche.”

The thought of her suffering was intolerable. He had a sudden vision of her standing in the kitchen-it was hardly larger than a cupboard-washing the plates and glasses, the forks and spoons, giving the knives a rapid polish on the knife-board；then putting everything away, giving the sink a scrub, and hanging the dish-cloth up to dry-it was there still, a grey, torn rag.Then looking round to see that everything was clean and nice.He saw her roll down her sleeves and remove her apron-the apron hung on a peg behind the door-and take the bottle of oxalic acid and go with it into the bedroom.

The agony of it drove him up from the bed and out of the room. He went into the studio.It was dark, for the curtains had been drawn over the great window, and he pulled them quickly back；but a sob broke from him as with a rapid glance he took in the place where he had been so happy.Nothing was changed here, either.Strickland was indifferent to his surroundings, and he had lived in the other's studio without thinking of altering a thing.It was deliberately artistic.It represented Stroeve's idea of the proper environment for an artist.There were bits of old brocade on the walls, and the piano was covered with a piece of silk, beautiful and tarnished；in one corner was a copy of the Venus of Milo, and in another of the Venus of the Medici.Here and there was an Italian cabinet surmounted with Delft, and here and there a bas-relief.In a handsome gold frame was a copy of Velasquez'Innocent X.，that Stroeve had made in Rome, and placed so as to make the most of their decorative effect were a number of Stroeve's pictures, all in splendid frames.Stroeve had always been very proud of his taste.He had never lost his appreciation for the romantic atmosphere of a studio, and though now the sight of it was like a stab in his heart, without thinking what he was at, he changed slightly the position of a Louis XV.table which was one of his treasures.Suddenly he caught sight of a canvas with its face to the wall.It was a much larger one than he himself was in the habit of using, and he wondered what it did there.He went over to it and leaned it towards him so that he could see the painting.It was a nude.His heart began to beat quickly, for he guessed at once that it was one of Strickland's pictures.He fung it back against the wall angrily-what did he mean by leaving it there？-but his movement caused it to fall, face downwards, on the ground.No matter whose the picture, he could not leave it there in the dust, and he raised it；but then curiosity got the better of him.He thought he would like to have a proper look at it, so he brought it along and set it on the easel.Then he stood back in order to see it at his ease.

He gave a gasp. It was the picture of a woman lying on a sofa, with one arm beneath her head and the other along her body；one knee was raised, and the other leg was stretched out.The pose was classic.Stroeve's head swam.It was Blanche.Grief and jealousy and rage seized him, and he cried out hoarsely；he was inarticulate；he clenched his fsts and raised them threateningly at an invisible enemy.He screamed at the top of his voice.He was beside himself.He could not bear it.That was too much.He looked round wildly for some instrument；he wanted to hack the picture to pieces；it should not exist another minute.He could see nothing that would serve his purpose；he rummaged about his painting things；somehow he could not fnd a thing；he was frantic.At last he came upon what he sought, a large scraper, and he pounced on it with a cry of triumph.He seized it as though it were a dagger, and ran to the picture.

As Stroeve told me this he became as excited as when the incident occurred, and he took hold of a dinner-knife on the table between us, and brandished it. He lifted his arm as though to strike, and then, opening his hand, let it fall with a clatter to the ground.He looked at me with a tremulous smile.He did not speak.

“Fire away，”I said.

“I don't know what happened to me. I was just going to make a great hole in the picture, I had my arm all ready for the blow, when suddenly I seemed to see it.”

“See what？”

“The picture. It was a work of art.I couldn't touch it.I was afraid.”

Stroeve was silent again, and he stared at me with his mouth open and his round blue eyes starting out of his head.

“It was a great, a wonderful picture. I was seized with awe.I had nearly committed a dreadful crime.I moved a little to see it better, and my foot knocked against the scraper.I shuddered.”

I really felt something of the emotion that had caught him. I was strangely impressed.It was as though I were suddenly transported into a world in which the values were changed.I stood by, at a loss, like a stranger in a land where the reactions of man to familiar things are all different from those he has known.Stroeve tried to talk to me about the picture, but he was incoherent, and I had to guess at what he meant.Strickland had burst the bonds that hitherto had held him.He had found, not himself, as the phrase goes, but a new soul with unsuspected powers.It was not only the bold simplification of the drawing which showed so rich and so singular a personality；it was not only the painting, though the fesh was painted with a passionate sensuality which had in it something miraculous；it was not only the solidity, so that you felt extraordinarily the weight of the body；there was also a spirituality, troubling and new, which led the imagination along unsuspected ways, and suggested dim empty spaces, lit only by the eternal stars, where the soul, all naked, adventured fearful to the discovery of new mysteries.

If I am rhetorical it was because Stroeve was rhetorical.（Do we not know that man in moments of emotion expresses himself naturally in the terms of a novelette？）Stroeve was trying to express a feeling which he had never known before, and he did not know how to put it into common terms. He was like the mystic seeking to describe the ineffable.But one fact was made clear to me；people talk of beauty lightly, and having no feeling for words, they use that one carelessly, so that it loses its force；and the thing it stands for, sharing its name with a hundred trivial objects, is deprived of dignity.They call beautiful a dress, a dog, a sermon；and when they are face to face with Beauty cannot recognize it.The false emphasis with which they try to deck their worthless thoughts blunts their susceptibilities.Like the charlatan who counterfeits a spiritual force he has sometimes felt, they lose the power they have abused.But Stroeve, the unconquerable buffoon, had a love and an understanding of beauty which were as honest and sincere as was his own sincere and honest soul.It meant to him what God means to the believer, and when he saw it he was afraid.

“What did you say to Strickland when you saw him？”

“I asked him to come with me to Holland.”

I was dumbfounded. I could only look at Stroeve in stupid amazement.

“We both loved Blanche. There would have been room for him in my mother's house.I think the company of poor, simple people would have done his soul a great good.I think he might have learnt from them something that would be very useful to him.”

“What did he say？”

“He smiled a little. I suppose he thought me very silly.He said he had other fsh to fry.”

I could have wished that Strickland had used some other phrase to indicate his refusal.

“He gave me the picture of Blanche.”

I wondered why Strickland had done that. But I made no remark, and for some time we kept silence.

“What have you done with all your things？”I said at last.

“I got a Jew in, and he gave me a round sum for the lot. I'm taking my pictures home with me.Besides them I own nothing in the world now but a box of clothes and a few books.”

“I'm glad you're going home，”I said.

I felt that his chance was to put all the past behind him. I hoped that the grief which now seemed intolerable would be softened by the lapse of time, and a merciful forgetfulness would help him to take up once more the burden of life.He was young still, and in a few years he would look back on all his misery with a sadness in which there would be something not unpleasurable.Sooner or later he would marry some honest soul in Holland, and I felt sure he would be happy.I smiled at the thought of the vast number of bad pictures he would paint before he died.

Next day I saw him off for Amsterdam.





Chapter XL


For the next month, occupied with my own affairs, I saw no one connected with this lamentable business, and my mind ceased to be occupied with it. But one day, when I was walking along, bent on some errand, I passed Charles Strickland.The sight of him brought back to me all the horror which I was not unwilling to forget, and I felt in me a sudden repulsion for the cause of it.Nodding, for it would have been childish to cut him, I walked on quickly；but in a minute I felt a hand on my shoulder.

“You're in a great hurry，”he said cordially.

It was characteristic of him to display geniality with anyone who showed a disinclination to meet him, and the coolness of my greeting can have left him in little doubt of that.

“I am，”I answered briefy.

“I'll walk along with you，”he said.

“Why？”I asked.

“For the pleasure of your society.”

I did not answer, and he walked by my side silently. We continued thus for perhaps a quarter of a mile.I began to feel a little ridiculous.At last we passed a stationer's, and it occurred to me that I might as well buy some paper.It would be an excuse to be rid of him.

“I'm going in here，”I said.“Good-bye.”

“I'll wait for you.”

I shrugged my shoulders, and went into the shop. I refected that French paper was bad, and that, foiled of my purpose, I need not burden myself with a purchase I did not need.I asked for something I knew could not be provided, and in a minute came out into the street.

“Did you get what you wanted？”he asked.

“No.”

We walked on in silence, and then came to a place where several streets met. I stopped at the kerb.

“Which way do you go？”I inquired.

“Your way，”he smiled.

“I'm going home.”

“I'll come along with you and smoke a pipe.”

“You might wait for an invitation，”I retorted frigidly.

“I would if I thought there was any chance of getting one.”

“Do you see that wall in front of you？”I said, pointing.

“Yes.”

“In that case I should have thought you could see also that I don't want your company.”

“I vaguely suspected it, I confess.”

I could not help a chuckle. It is one of the defects of my character that I cannot altogether dislike anyone who makes me laugh.But I pulled myself together.

“I think you're detestable. You're the most loathsome beast that it's ever been my misfortune to meet.Why do you seek the society of someone who hates and despises you？”

“My dear fellow, what the hell do you suppose I care what you think of me？”

“Damn it all，”I said, more violently because I had an inkling my motive was none too creditable，“I don't want to know you.”

“Are you afraid I shall corrupt you？”

His tone made me feel not a little ridiculous. I knew that he was looking at me sideways, with a sardonic smile.

“I suppose you are hard up，”I remarked insolently.

“I should be a damned fool if I thought I had any chance of borrowing money from you.”

“You've come down in the world if you can bring yourself to fatter.”

He grinned.

“You'll never really dislike me so long as I give you the opportunity to get off a good thing now and then.”

I had to bite my lip to prevent myself from laughing. What he said had a hateful truth in it, and another defect of my character is that I enjoy the company of those, however depraved, who can give me a Roland for my Oliver.I began to feel that my abhorrence for Strickland could only be sustained by an effort on my part.I recognized my moral weakness, but saw that my disapprobation had in it already something of a pose；and I knew that if I felt it, his own keen instinct had discovered it too.He was certainly laughing at me up his sleeve.I left him the last word, and sought refuge in a shrug of the shoulders and taciturnity.





Chapter XLI


We arrived at the house in which I lived. I would not ask him to come in with me, but walked up the stairs without a word.He followed me, and entered the apartment on my heels.He had not been in it before, but he never gave a glance at the room I had been at pains to make pleasing to the eye.There was a tin of tobacco on the table, and, taking out his pipe, he flled it.He sat down on the only chair that had no arms and tilted himself on the back legs.

“If you're going to make yourself at home, why don't you sit in an arm-chair？”I asked irritably.

“Why are you concerned about my comfort？”

“I'm not，”I retorted，“but only about my own. It makes me uncomfortable to see someone sit on an uncomfortable chair.”

He chuckled, but did not move. He smoked on in silence, taking no further notice of me, and apparently was absorbed in thought.I wondered why he had come.

Until long habit has blunted the sensibility, there is something disconcerting to the writer in the instinct which causes him to take an interest in the singularities of human nature so absorbing that his moral sense is powerless against it. He recognizes in himself an artistic satisfaction in the contemplation of evil which a little startles him；but sincerity forces him to confess that the disapproval he feels for certain actions is not nearly so strong as his curiosity in their reasons.The character of a scoundrel, logical and complete, has a fascination for his creator which is an outrage to law and order.I expect that Shakespeare devised Iago with a gusto which he never knew when, weaving moonbeams with his fancy, he imagined Desdemona.It may be that in his rogues the writer gratifies instincts deep-rooted in him, which the manners and customs of a civilized world have forced back to the mysterious recesses of the subconscious.In giving to the character of his invention fesh and bones he is giving life to that part of himself which fnds no other means of expression.His satisfaction is a sense of liberation.

The writer is more concerned to know than to judge.

There was in my soul a perfectly genuine horror of Strickland, and side by side with it a cold curiosity to discover his motives. I was puzzled by him, and I was eager to see how he regarded the tragedy he had caused in the lives of people who had used him with so much kindness.I applied the scalpel boldly.

“Stroeve told me that picture you painted of his wife was the best thing you've ever done.”

Strickland took his pipe out of his mouth, and a smile lit up his eyes.

“It was great fun to do.”

“Why did you give it him？”

“I'd fnished it. It wasn't any good to me.”

“Do you know that Stroeve nearly destroyed it？”

“It wasn't altogether satisfactory.”

He was quiet for a moment or two, then he took his pipe out of his mouth again, and chuckled.

“Do you know that the little man came to see me？”

“Weren't you rather touched by what he had to say？”

“No；I thought it damned silly and sentimental.”

“I suppose it escaped your memory that you'd ruined his life？”I remarked.

He rubbed his bearded chin refectively.

“He's a very bad painter.”

“But a very good man.”

“And an excellent cook，”Strickland added derisively.

His callousness was inhuman, and in my indignation I was not inclined to mince my words.

“As a mere matter of curiosity I wish you'd tell me, have you felt the smallest twinge of remorse for Blanche Stroeve's death？”

I watched his face for some change of expression, but it remained impassive.

“Why should I？”he asked.

“Let me put the facts before you. You were dying, and Dirk Stroeve took you into his own house.He nursed you like a mother.He sacrifced his time and his comfort and his money for you.He snatched you from the jaws of death.”

Strickland shrugged his shoulders.

“The absurd little man enjoys doing things for other people. That's his life.”

“Granting that you owed him no gratitude, were you obliged to go out of your way to take his wife from him？Until you came on the scene they were happy. Why couldn't you leave them alone？”

“What makes you think they were happy？”

“It was evident.”

“You are a discerning fellow. Do you think she could ever have forgiven him for what he did for her？”

“What do you mean by that？”

“Don't you know why he married her？”

I shook my head.

“She was a governess in the family of some Roman prince, and the son of the house seduced her. She thought he was going to marry her.They turned her out into the street neck and crop.She was going to have a baby, and she tried to commit suicide.Stroeve found her and married her.”

“It was just like him. I never knew anyone with so compassionate a heart.”

I had often wondered why that ill-assorted pair had married, but just that explanation had never occurred to me. That was perhaps the cause of the peculiar quality of Dirk's love for his wife.I had noticed in it something more than passion.I remembered also how I had always fancied that her reserve concealed I knew not what；but now I saw in it more than the desire to hide a shameful secret.Her tranquillity was like the sullen calm that broods over an island which has been swept by a hurricane.Her cheerfulness was the cheerfulness of despair.Strickland interrupted my refections with an observation the profound cynicism of which startled me.

“A woman can forgive a man for the harm he does her，”he said，“but she can never forgive him for the sacrifces he makes on her account.”

“It must be reassuring to you to know that you certainly run no risk of incurring the resentment of the women you come in contact with，”I retorted.

A slight smile broke on his lips.

“You are always prepared to sacrifice your principles for a repartee，”he answered.

“What happened to the child？”

“Oh, it was still-born, three or four months after they were married.”

Then I came to the question which had seemed to me most puzzling.

“Will you tell me why you bothered about Blanche Stroeve at all？”

He did not answer for so long that I nearly repeated it.

“How do I know？”he said at last.“She couldn't bear the sight of me. It amused me.”

“I see.”

He gave a sudden fash of anger.

“Damn it all, I wanted her.”

But he recovered his temper immediately, and looked at me with a smile.

“At frst she was horrifed.”

“Did you tell her？”

“There wasn't any need. She knew.I never said a word.She was frightened.At last I took her.”

I do not know what there was in the way he told me this that extraordinarily suggested the violence of his desire. It was disconcerting and rather horrible.His life was strangely divorced from material things, and it was as though his body at times wreaked a fearful revenge on his spirit.The satyr in him suddenly took possession, and he was powerless in the grip of an instinct which had all the strength of the primitive forces of nature.It was an obsession so complete that there was no room in his soul for prudence or gratitude.

“But why did you want to take her away with you？”I asked.

“I didn't，”he answered, frowning.“When she said she was coming I was nearly as surprised as Stroeve. I told her that when I'd had enough of her she'd have to go, and she said she'd risk that.”He paused a little.“She had a wonderful body, and I wanted to paint a nude.When I'd fnished my picture I took no more interest in her.”

“And she loved you with all her heart.”

He sprang to his feet and walked up and down the small room.

“I don't want love. I haven't time for it.It's weakness.I am a man, and sometimes I want a woman.When I've satisfed my passion I'm ready for other things.I can’t overcome my desire, but I hate it；it imprisons my spirit；I look forward to the time when I shall be free from all desire and can give myself without hindrance to my work.Because women can do nothing except love, they’ve given it a ridiculous importance.They want to persuade us that it’s the whole of life.It’s an insignifcant part.I know lust.That’s normal and healthy.Love is a disease.Women are the instruments of my pleasure；I have no patience with their claim to be helpmates, partners, companions.”

I had never heard Strickland speak so much at one time. He spoke with a passion of indignation.But neither here nor elsewhere do I pretend to give his exact words；his vocabulary was small, and he had no gift for framing sentences, so that one had to piece his meaning together out of interjections, the expression of his face, gestures and hackneyed phrases.

“You should have lived at a time when women were chattels and men the masters of slaves，”I said.

“It just happens that I am a completely normal man.”

I could not help laughing at this remark, made in all seriousness；but he went on, walking up and down the room like a caged beast, intent on expressing what he felt, but found such diffculty in putting coherently.

“When a woman loves you she's not satisfed until she possesses your soul. Because she's weak, she has a rage for domination, and nothing less will satisfy her.She has a small mind, and she resents the abstract which she is unable to grasp.She is occupied with material things, and she is jealous of the ideal.The soul of man wanders through the uttermost regions of the universe, and she seeks to imprison it in the circle of her account-book.Do you remember my wife？I saw Blanche little by little trying all her tricks.With infnite patience she prepared to snare me and bind me.She wanted to bring me down to her level；she cared nothing for me, she only wanted me to be hers.She was willing to do everything in the world for me except the one thing I wanted：to leave me alone.”

I was silent for a while.

“What did you expect her to do when you left her？”

“She could have gone back to Stroeve，”he said irritably.“He was ready to take her.”

“You're inhuman，”I answered.“It's as useless to talk to you about these things as to describe colours to a man who was born blind.”

He stopped in front of my chair, and stood looking down at me with an expression in which I read a contemptuous amazement.

“Do you really care a twopenny damn if Blanche Stroeve is alive or dead？”

I thought over his question, for I wanted to answer it truthfully, at all events to my soul.

“It may be a lack of sympathy in myself if it does not make any great difference to me that she is dead. Life had a great deal to offer her.I think it's terrible that she should have been deprived of it in that cruel way, and I am ashamed because I do not really care.”

“You have not the courage of your convictions. Life has no value.Blanche Stroeve didn't commit suicide because I left her, but because she was a foolish and unbalanced woman.But we've talked about her quite enough；she was an entirely unimportant person.Come, and I'll show you my pictures.”

He spoke as though I were a child that needed to be distracted. I was sore, but not with him so much as with myself.I thought of the happy life that pair had led in the cosy studio in Montmartre, Stroeve and his wife, their simplicity, kindness, and hospitality；it seemed to me cruel that it should have been broken to pieces by a ruthless chance；but the cruellest thing of all was that in fact it made no great difference.The world went on, and no one was a penny the worse for all that wretchedness.I had an idea that Dirk, a man of greater emotional reactions than depth of feeling, would soon forget；and Blanche's life, begun with who knows what bright hopes and what dreams, might just as well have never been lived.It all seemed useless and inane.

Strickland had found his hat, and stood looking at me.

“Are you coming？”

“Why do you seek my acquaintance？”I asked him.“You know that I hate and despise you.”

He chuckled good-humouredly.

“Your only quarrel with me really is that I don't care a twopenny damn what you think about me.”

I felt my cheeks grow red with sudden anger. It was impossible to make him understand that one might be outraged by his callous selfishness.I longed to pierce his armour of complete indifference.I knew also that in the end there was truth in what he said.Unconsciously, perhaps, we treasure the power we have over people by their regard for our opinion of them, and we hate those upon whom we have no such infuence.I suppose it is the bitterest wound to human pride.But I would not let him see that I was put out.

“Is it possible for any man to disregard others entirely？”I said, though more to myself than to him.“You're dependent on others for everything in existence. It's a preposterous attempt to try to live only for yourself and by yourself.Sooner or later you'll be ill and tired and old, and then you'll crawl back into the herd.Won't you be ashamed when you feel in your heart the desire for comfort and sympathy？You’re trying an impossible thing.Sooner or later the human being in you will yearn for the common bonds of humanity.”

“Come and look at my pictures.”

“Have you ever thought of death？”

“Why should I？It doesn't matter.”

I stared at him. He stood before me, motionless, with a mocking smile in his eyes；but for all that, for a moment I had an inkling of a fiery, tortured spirit, aiming at something greater than could be conceived by anything that was bound up with the fesh.I had a feeting glimpse of a pursuit of the ineffable.I looked at the man before me in his shabby clothes, with his great nose and shining eyes, his red beard and untidy hair；and I had a strange sensation that it was only an envelope, and I was in the presence of a disembodied spirit.

“Let us go and look at your pictures，”I said.





Chapter XLII


I did not know why Strickland had suddenly offered to show them to me. I welcomed the opportunity.A man's work reveals him.In social intercourse he gives you the surface that he wishes the world to accept, and you can only gain a true knowledge of him by inferences from little actions, of which he is unconscious, and from fleeting expressions, which cross his face unknown to him.Sometimes people carry to such perfection the mask they have assumed that in due course they actually become the person they seem.But in his book or his picture the real man delivers himself defenceless.His pretentiousness will only expose his vacuity.The lath painted to look like iron is seen to be but a lath.No affectation of peculiarity can conceal a commonplace mind.To the acute observer no one can produce the most casual work without disclosing the innermost secrets of his soul.

As I walked up the endless stairs of the house in which Strickland lived, I confess that I was a little excited. It seemed to me that I was on the threshold of a surprising adventure.I looked about the room with curiosity.It was even smaller and more bare than I remembered it.I wondered what those friends of mine would say who demanded vast studios, and vowed they could not work unless all the conditions were to their liking.

“You'd better stand there，”he said, pointing to a spot from which, presumably, he fancied I could see to best advantage what he had to show me.

“You don't want me to talk, I suppose，”I said.

“No, blast you；I want you to hold your tongue.”

He placed a picture on the easel, and let me look at it for a minute or two；then took it down and put another in its place. I think he showed me about thirty canvases.It was the result of the six years during which he had been painting.He had never sold a picture.The canvases were of different sizes.The smaller were pictures of still-life and the largest were landscapes.There were about half a dozen portraits.

“That is the lot，”he said at last.

I wish I could say that I recognized at once their beauty and their great originality. Now that I have seen many of them again and the rest are familiar to me in reproductions, I am astonished that at frst sight I was bitterly disappointed.I felt nothing of the peculiar thrill which it is the property of art to give.The impression that Strickland's pictures gave me was disconcerting；and the fact remains, always to reproach me, that I never even thought of buying any.I missed a wonderful chance.Most of them have found their way into museums, and the rest are the treasured possessions of wealthy amateurs.I try to fnd excuses for myself.I think that my taste is good, but I am conscious that it has no originality.I know very little about painting, and I wander along trails that others have blazed for me.At that time I had the greatest admiration for the Impressionists.I longed to possess a Sisley and a Degas, and I worshipped Manet.His Olympia seemed to me the greatest picture of modern times, and Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe moved me profoundly.These works seemed to me the last word in painting.

I will not describe the pictures that Strickland showed me. Descriptions of pictures are always dull, and these, besides, are familiar to all who take an interest in such things.Now that his infuence has so enormously affected modern painting, now that others have charted the country which he was among the frst to explore, Strickland's pictures, seen for the frst time, would fnd the mind more prepared for them；but it must be remembered that I had never seen anything of the sort.First of all I was taken aback by what seemed to me the clumsiness of his technique.Accustomed to the drawing of the old masters, and convinced that Ingres was the greatest draughtsman of recent times, I thought that Strickland drew very badly.I knew nothing of the simplifcation at which he aimed.I remembered a still-life of oranges on a plate, and I was bothered because the plate was not round and the oranges were lop-sided.The portraits were a little larger than life-size, and this gave them an ungainly look.To my eyes the faces looked like caricatures.They were painted in a way that was entirely new to me.The landscapes puzzled me even more.There were two or three pictures of the forest at Fontainebleau and several of streets in Paris：my first feeling was that they might have been painted by a drunken cab-driver.I was perfectly bewildered.The colour seemed to me extraordinarily crude.It passed through my mind that the whole thing was a stupendous, incomprehensible farce.Now that I look back I am more than ever impressed by Stroeve's acuteness.He saw from the frst that here was a revolution in art, and he recognized in its beginnings the genius which now all the world allows.

But if I was puzzled and disconcerted, I was not unimpressed. Even I, in my colossal ignorance, could not but feel that here, trying to express itself, was real power.I was excited and interested.I felt that these pictures had something to say to me that was very important for me to know, but I could not tell what it was.They seemed to me ugly, but they suggested without disclosing a secret of momentous signifcance.They were strangely tantalizing.They gave me an emotion that I could not analyse.They said something that words were powerless to utter.I fancy that Strickland saw vaguely some spiritual meaning in material things that was so strange that he could only suggest it with halting symbols.It was as though he found in the chaos of the universe a new pattern, and were attempting clumsily, with anguish of soul, to set it down.I saw a tormented spirit striving for the release of expression.

I turned to him.

“I wonder if you haven't mistaken your medium，”I said.

“What the hell do you mean？”

“I think you're trying to say something, I don't quite know what it is, but I'm not sure that the best way of saying it is by means of painting.”

When I imagined that on seeing his pictures I should get a clue to the understanding of his strange character I was mistaken. They merely increased the astonishment with which he flled me.I was more at sea than ever.The only thing that seemed clear to me-and perhaps even this was fanciful-was that he was passionately striving for liberation from some power that held him.But what the power was and what line the liberation would take remained obscure.Each one of us is alone in the world.He is shut in a tower of brass, and can communicate with his fellows only by signs, and the signs have no common value, so that their sense is vague and uncertain.We seek pitifully to convey to others the treasures of our heart, but they have not the power to accept them, and so we go lonely, side by side but not together, unable to know our fellows and unknown by them.We are like people living in a country whose language they know so little that, with all manner of beautiful and profound things to say, they are condemned to the banalities of the conversation manual.Their brain is seething with ideas, and they can only tell you that the umbrella of the gardener's aunt is in the house.

The final impression I received was of a prodigious effort to express some state of the soul, and in this effort, I fancied, must be sought the explanation of what so utterly perplexed me. It was evident that colours and forms had a significance for Strickland that was peculiar to himself.He was under an intolerable necessity to convey something that he felt, and he created them with that intention alone.He did not hesitate to simplify or to distort if he could get nearer to that unknown thing he sought.Facts were nothing to him, for beneath the mass of irrelevant incidents he looked for something significant to himself.It was as though he had become aware of the soul of the universe and were compelled to express it.Though these pictures confused and puzzled me, I could not be unmoved by the emotion that was patent in them；and, I knew not why, I felt in myself a feeling that with regard to Strickland was the last I had ever expected to experience.I felt an overwhelming compassion.

“I think I know now why you surrendered to your feeling for Blanche Stroeve，”I said to him.

“Why？”

“I think your courage failed. The weakness of your body communicated itself to your soul.I do not know what infnite yearning possesses you, so that you are driven to a perilous, lonely search for some goal where you expect to find a final release from the spirit that torments you.I see you as the eternal pilgrim to some shrine that perhaps does not exist.I do not know at what inscrutable Nirvana you aim.Do you know yourself？Perhaps it is Truth and Freedom that you seek, and for a moment you thought that you might fnd release in Love.I think your tired soul sought rest in a woman's arms, and when you found no rest there you hated her.You had no pity for her, because you have no pity for yourself.And you killed her out of fear, because you trembled still at the danger you had barely escaped.”

He smiled dryly and pulled his beard.

“You are a dreadful sentimentalist, my poor friend.”

A week later I heard by chance that Strickland had gone to Marseilles. I never saw him again.





Chapter XLIII


Looking back, I realize that what I have written about Charles Strickland must seem very unsatisfactory. I have given incidents that came to my knowledge, but they remain obscure because I do not know the reason that led to them.The strangest, Strickland's determination to become a painter, seems to be arbitrary；and though it must have had causes in the circumstances of his life, I am ignorant of them.From his own conversation I was able to glean nothing.If I were writing a novel, rather than narrating such facts as I know of a curious personality, I should have invented much to account for this change of heart.I think I should have shown a strong vocation in boyhood, crushed by the will of his father or sacrificed to the necessity of earning a living；I should have pictured him impatient of the restraints of life；and in the struggle between his passion for art and the duties of his station I could have aroused sympathy for him.I should so have made him a more imposing fgure.Perhaps it would have been possible to see in him a new Prometheus.There was here, maybe, the opportunity for a modern version of the hero who for the good of mankind exposes himself to the agonies of the damned.It is always a moving subject.

On the other hand, I might have found his motives in the infuence of the marriage relation. There are a dozen ways in which this might be managed.A latent gift might reveal itself on acquaintance with the painters and writers whose society his wife sought；or domestic incompatibility might turn him upon himself；a love affair might fan into bright fame a fre which I could have shown smouldering dimly in his heart.I think then I should have drawn Mrs.Strickland quite differently.I should have abandoned the facts and made her a nagging, tiresome woman, or else a bigoted one with no sympathy for the claims of the spirit.I should have made Strickland's marriage a long torment from which escape was the only possible issue.I think I should have emphasized his patience with the unsuitable mate, and the compassion which made him unwilling to throw off the yoke that oppressed him.I should certainly have eliminated the children.

An effective story might also have been made by bringing him into contact with some old painter whom the pressure of want or the desire for commercial success had made false to the genius of his youth, and who, seeing in Strickland the possibilities which himself had wasted, infuenced him to forsake all and follow the divine tyranny of art. I think there would have been something ironic in the picture of the successful old man, rich and honoured, living in another the life which he, though knowing it was the better part, had not had the strength to pursue.

The facts are much duller. Strickland, a boy fresh from school, went into a broker's office without any feeling of distaste.Until he married he led the ordinary life of his fellows, gambling mildly on the Exchange, interested to the extent of a sovereign or two on the result of the Derby or the Oxford and Cambridge Race.I think he boxed a little in his spare time.On his chimney-piece he had photographs of Mrs.Langtry and Mary Anderson.He read Punch and the Sporting Times.He went to dances in Hampstead.

It matters less that for so long I should have lost sight of him. The years during which he was struggling to acquire profciency in a diffcult art were monotonous, and I do not know that there was anything signifcant in the shifts to which he was put to earn enough money to keep him.An account of them would be an account of the things he had seen happen to other people.I do not think they had any effect on his own character.He must have acquired experiences which would form abundant material for a picaresque novel of modern Paris, but he remained aloof, and judging from his conversation there was nothing in those years that had made a particular impression on him.Perhaps when he went to Paris he was too old to fall a victim to the glamour of his environment.Strange as it may seem, he always appeared to me not only practical, but immensely matter-of-fact.I suppose his life during this period was romantic, but he certainly saw no romance in it.It may be that in order to realize the romance of life you must have something of the actor in you；and, capable of standing outside yourself, you must be able to watch your actions with an interest at once detached and absorbed.But no one was more single-minded than Strickland.I never knew anyone who was less self-conscious.But it is unfortunate that I can give no description of the arduous steps by which he reached such mastery over his art as he ever acquired；for if I could show him undaunted by failure, by an unceasing effort of courage holding despair at bay, doggedly persistent in the face of self-doubt, which is the artist's bitterest enemy, I might excite some sympathy for a personality which, I am all too conscious, must appear singularly devoid of charm.But I have nothing to go on.I never once saw Strickland at work, nor do I know that anyone else did.He kept the secret of his struggles to himself.If in the loneliness of his studio he wrestled desperately with the Angel of the Lord he never allowed a soul to divine his anguish.

When I come to his connexion with Blanche Stroeve I am exasperated by the fragmentariness of the facts at my disposal. To give my story coherence I should describe the progress of their tragic union, but I know nothing of the three months during which they lived together.I do not know how they got on or what they talked about.After all, there are twenty-four hours in the day, and the summits of emotion can only be reached at rare intervals.I can only imagine how they passed the rest of the time.While the light lasted and so long as Blanche's strength endured, I suppose that Strickland painted, and it must have irritated her when she saw him absorbed in his work.As a mistress she did not then exist for him, but only as a model；and then there were long hours in which they lived side by side in silence.It must have frightened her.When Strickland suggested that in her surrender to him there was a sense of triumph over Dirk Stroeve, because he had come to her help in her extremity, he opened the door to many a dark conjecture.I hope it was not true.It seems to me rather horrible.But who can fathom the subtleties of the human heart？Certainly not those who expect from it only decorous sentiments and normal emotions.When Blanche saw that, notwithstanding his moments of passion, Strickland remained aloof, she must have been filled with dismay, and even in those moments I surmise that she realized that to him she was not an individual, but an instrument of pleasure；he was a stranger still, and she tried to bind him to herself with pathetic arts.She strove to ensnare him with comfort and would not see that comfort meant nothing to him.She was at pains to get him the things to eat that he liked, and would not see that he was indifferent to food.She was afraid to leave him alone.She pursued him with attentions, and when his passion was dormant sought to excite it， for then at least she had the illusion of holding him.Perhaps she knew with her intelligence that the chains she forged only aroused his instinct of destruction, as the plate-glass window makes your fingers itch for half a brick；but her heart, incapable of reason, made her continue on a course she knew was fatal.She must have been very unhappy.But the blindness of love led her to believe what she wanted to be true, and her love was so great that it seemed impossible to her that it should not in return awake an equal love.

But my study of Strickland's character suffers from a graver defect than my ignorance of many facts. Because they were obvious and striking, I have written of his relations to women；and yet they were but an insignificant part of his life.It is an irony that they should so tragically have affected others.His real life consisted of dreams and of tremendously hard work.

Here lies the unreality of fction. For in men, as a rule, love is but an episode which takes its place among the other affairs of the day, and the emphasis laid on it in novels gives it an importance which is untrue to life.There are few men to whom it is the most important thing in the world, and they are not very interesting ones；even women, with whom the subject is of paramount interest, have a contempt for them.They are fattered and excited by them, but have an uneasy feeling that they are poor creatures.But even during the brief intervals in which they are in love, men do other things which distract their minds；the trades by which they earn their living engage their attention；they are absorbed in sport；they can interest themselves in art.For the most part, they keep their various activities in various compartments, and they can pursue one to the temporary exclusion of the other.They have a faculty of concentration on that which occupies them at the moment, and it irks them if one encroaches on the other.As lovers, the difference between men and women is that women can love all day long, but men only at times.

With Strickland the sexual appetite took a very small place. It was unimportant.It was irksome.His soul aimed elsewhither.He had violent passions, and on occasion desire seized his body so that he was driven to an orgy of lust, but he hated the instincts that robbed him of his self-possession.I think, even, he hated the inevitable partner in his debauchery.When he had regained command over himself, he shuddered at the sight of the woman he had enjoyed.His thoughts foated then serenely in the empyrean, and he felt towards her the horror that perhaps the painted butterfy, hovering about the fowers, feels for the flthy chrysalis from which it has triumphantly emerged.I suppose that art is a manifestation of the sexual instinct.It is the same emotion which is excited in the human heart by the sight of a lovely woman, the Bay of Naples under the yellow moon, and the Entombment of Titian.It is possible that Strickland hated the normal release of sex because it seemed to him brutal by comparison with the satisfaction of artistic creation.It seems strange even to myself, when I have described a man who was cruel, selfish, brutal and sensual, to say that he was a great idealist.The fact remains.

He lived more poorly than an artisan. He worked harder.He cared nothing for those things which with most people make life gracious and beautiful.He was indifferent to money.He cared nothing about fame.You cannot praise him because he resisted the temptation to make any of those compromises with the world which most of us yield to.He had no such temptation.It never entered his head that compromise was possible.He lived in Paris more lonely than an anchorite in the deserts of Thebes.He asked nothing from his fellows except that they should leave him alone.He was single-hearted in his aim, and to pursue it he was willing to sacrifice not only himself-many can do that-but others.He had a vision.

Strickland was an odious man, but I still think he was a great one.





Chapter XLIV


A certain importance attaches to the views on art of painters, and this is the natural place for me to set down what I know of Strickland's opinions of the great artists of the past. I am afraid I have very little worth noting.Strickland was not a conversationalist, and he had no gift for putting what he had to say in the striking phrase that the listener remembers.He had no wit.His humour, as will be seen if I have in any way succeeded in reproducing the manner of his conversation, was sardonic.His repartee was rude.He made one laugh sometimes by speaking the truth, but this is a form of humour which gains its force only by its unusualness；it would cease to amuse if it were commonly practised.

Strickland was not, I should say, a man of great intelligence, and his views on painting were by no means out of the ordinary. I never heard him speak of those whose work had a certain analogy with his own-of Cézanne, for instance, or of Van Gogh；and I doubt very much if he had ever seen their pictures.He was not greatly interested in the Impressionists.Their technique impressed him, but I fancy that he thought their attitude commonplace.When Stroeve was holding forth at length on the excellence of Monet, he said：“I prefer Winterhalter.”But I dare say he said it to annoy, and if he did he certainly succeeded.

I am disappointed that I cannot report any extravagances in his opinions on the old masters. There is so much in his character which is strange that I feel it would complete the picture if his views were outrageous.I feel the need to ascribe to him fantastic theories about his predecessors, and it is with a certain sense of disillusion that I confess he thought about them pretty much as does everybody else.I do not believe he knew El Greco.He had a great but somewhat impatient admiration for Velasquez.Chardin delighted him, and Rembrandt moved him to ecstasy.He described the impression that Rembrandt made on him with a coarseness I cannot repeat.The only painter that interested him who was at all unexpected was Brueghel the Elder.I knew very little about him at that time, and Strickland had no power to explain himself.I remember what he said about him because it was so unsatisfactory.

“He's all right，”said Strickland.“I bet he found it hell to paint.”

When later, in Vienna, I saw several of Peter Brueghel's pictures, I thought I understood why he had attracted Strickland's attention. Here, too, was a man with a vision of the world peculiar to himself.I made somewhat copious notes at the time, intending to write something about him, but I have lost them, and have now only the recollection of an emotion.He seemed to see his fellow-creatures grotesquely, and he was angry with them because they were grotesque；life was a confusion of ridiculous, sordid happenings, a ft subject for laughter, and yet it made him sorrowful to laugh.Brueghel gave me the impression of a man striving to express in one medium feelings more appropriate to expression in another, and it may be that it was the obscure consciousness of this that excited Strickland's sympathy.Perhaps both were trying to put down in paint ideas which were more suitable to literature.

Strickland at this time must have been nearly forty-seven.





Chapter XLV


I have said already that but for the hazard of a journey to Tahiti I should doubtless never have written this book. It is thither that after many wanderings Charles Strickland came, and it is there that he painted the pictures on which his fame most securely rests.I suppose no artist achieves completely the realization of the dream that obsesses him, and Strickland, harassed incessantly by his struggle with technique, managed, perhaps, less than others to express the vision that he saw with his mind's eye；but in Tahiti the circumstances were favourable to him；he found in his surroundings the accidents necessary for his inspiration to become effective, and his later pictures give at least a suggestion of what he sought.They offer the imagination something new and strange.It is as though in this far country his spirit, that had wandered disembodied, seeking a tenement, at last was able to clothe itself in fesh.To use the hackneyed phrase, here he found himself.

It would seem natural that my visit to this remote island should immediately revive my interest in Strickland, but the work I was engaged in occupied my attention to the exclusion of whatever was irrelevant, and it was not till I had been there some days that I even remembered his connexion with it. After all, I had not seen him for fifteen years, and it was nine since he died.But I think my arrival at Tahiti would have driven out of my head matters of much more immediate importance to me, and even after a week I found it not easy to order myself soberly.I remember that on my first morning I awoke early, and when I came on to the terrace of the hotel no one was stirring.I wandered round to the kitchen, but it was locked, and on a bench outside it a native boy was sleeping.There seemed no chance of breakfast for some time, so I sauntered down to the water-front.The Chinamen were already busy in their shops.The sky had still the pallor of dawn, and there was a ghostly silence on the lagoon.Ten miles away the island of Murea, like some high fastness of the Holy Grail, guarded its mystery.

I did not altogether believe my eyes. The days that had passed since I left Wellington seemed extraordinary and unusual.Wellington is trim and neat and English；it reminds you of a seaport town on the South Coast.And for three days afterwards the sea was stormy.Grey clouds chased one another across the sky.Then the wind dropped, and the sea was calm and blue.The Pacifc is more desolate than other seas；its spaces seem more vast, and the most ordinary journey upon it has somehow the feeling of an adventure.The air you breathe is an elixir which prepares you for the unexpected.Nor is it vouchsafed to man in the flesh to know aught that more nearly suggests the golden realms of fancy than the approach to Tahiti.Murea, the sister isle, comes into view in rocky splendour, rising from the desert sea mysteriously, like the unsubstantial fabric of a magic wand.With its jagged outline it is like a Montserrat of the Pacific, and you may imagine that there Polynesian knights guard with strange rites mysteries unholy for men to know.The beauty of the island is unveiled as diminishing distance shows you in distincter shape its lovely peaks, but it keeps its secret as you sail by, and, darkly inviolable, seems to fold itself together in a stony, inaccessible grimness.It would not surprise you if, as you came near seeking for an opening in the reef, it vanished suddenly from your view, and nothing met your gaze but the blue loneliness of the Pacifc.

Tahiti is a lofty green island, with deep folds of a darker green, in which you divine silent valleys；there is mystery in their sombre depths, down which murmur and plash cool streams, and you feel that in those umbrageous places life from immemorial times has been led according to immemorial ways. Even here is something sad and terrible.But the impression is fleeting, and serves only to give a greater acuteness to the enjoyment of the moment.It is like the sadness which you may see in the jester's eyes when a merry company is laughing at his sallies；his lips smile and his jokes are gayer because in the communion of laughter he fnds himself more intolerably alone.For Tahiti is smiling and friendly；it is like a lovely woman graciously prodigal of her charm and beauty；and nothing can be more conciliatory than the entrance into the harbour at Papeete.The schooners moored to the quay are trim and neat, the little town along the bay is white and urbane, and the famboyants, scarlet against the blue sky, faunt their colour like a cry of passion.They are sensual with an unashamed violence that leaves you breathless.And the crowd that throngs the wharf as the steamer draws alongside is gay and debonair；it is a noisy, cheerful, gesticulating crowd.It is a sea of brown faces.You have an impression of coloured movement against the faming blue of the sky.Everything is done with a great deal of bustle, the unloading of the baggage, the examination of the customs；and everyone seems to smile at you.It is very hot.The colour dazzles you.





Chapter XLVI


I had not been in Tahiti long before I met Captain Nichols. He came in one morning when I was having breakfast on the terrace of the hotel and introduced himself.He had heard that I was interested in Charles Strickland, and announced that he was come to have a talk about him.They are as fond of gossip in Tahiti as in an English village, and one or two inquiries I had made for pictures by Strickland had been quickly spread.I asked the stranger if he had breakfasted.

“Yes；I have my coffee early，”he answered，“but I don't mind having a drop of whisky.”

I called the Chinese boy.

“You don't think it's too early？”said the Captain.

“You and your liver must decide that between you，”I replied.

“I'm practically a teetotaller，”he said, as he poured himself out a good half-tumbler of Canadian Club.

When he smiled he showed broken and discoloured teeth. He was a very lean man, of no more than average height, with grey hair cut short and a stubby grey moustache.He had not shaved for a couple of days.His face was deeply lined, burned brown by long exposure to the sun, and he had a pair of small blue eyes which were astonishingly shifty.They moved quickly, following my smallest gesture, and gave him the look of a very thorough rogue.But at the moment he was all heartiness and good-fellowship.He was dressed in a bedraggled suit of khaki, and his hands would have been all the better for a wash.

“I knew Strickland well，”he said, as he leaned back in his chair and lit the cigar I had offered him.“It's through me he came out to the islands.”

“Where did you meet him？”I asked.

“In Marseilles.”

“What were you doing there？”

He gave me an ingratiating smile.

“Well, I guess I was on the beach.”

My friend's appearance suggested that he was now in the same predicament, and I prepared myself to cultivate an agreeable acquaintance. The society of beach-combers always repays the small pains you need be at to enjoy it.They are easy of approach and affable in conversation.They seldom put on airs, and the offer of a drink is a sure way to their hearts.You need no laborious steps to enter upon familiarity with them, and you can earn not only their confidence, but their gratitude, by turning an attentive ear to their discourse.They look upon conversation as the great pleasure of life, thereby proving the excellence of their civilization, and for the most part they are entertaining talkers.The extent of their experience is pleasantly balanced by the fertility of their imagination.It cannot be said that they are without guile, but they have a tolerant respect for the law, when the law is supported by strength.It is hazardous to play poker with them, but their ingenuity adds a peculiar excitement to the best game in the world.I came to know Captain Nichols very well before I left Tahiti, and I am the richer for his acquaintance.I do not consider that the cigars and whisky he consumed at my expense（he always refused cocktails, since he was practically a teetotaller），and the few dollars, borrowed with a civil air of conferring a favour upon me, that passed from my pocket to his, were in any way equivalent to the entertainment he afforded me.I remained his debtor.I should be sorry if my conscience, insisting on a rigid attention to the matter in hand, forced me to dismiss him in a couple of lines.

I do not know why Captain Nichols first left England. It was a matter upon which he was reticent, and with persons of his kid-ney a direct question is never very discreet.He hinted at undeserved misfortune, and there is no doubt that he looked upon himself as the victim of injustice.My fancy played with the various forms of fraud and violence, and I agreed with him sympathetically when he remarked that the authorities in the old country were so damned technical.But it was nice to see that any unpleasantness he had endured in his native land had not impaired his ardent patriotism.He frequently declared that England was the fnest country in the world, sir, and he felt a lively superiority over Americans, Colonials, Dagos, Dutchmen, and Kanakas.

But I do not think he was a happy man. He suffered from dyspepsia, and he might often be seen sucking a tablet of pepsin；in the morning his appetite was poor；but this affliction alone would hardly have impaired his spirits.He had a greater cause of discontent with life than this.Eight years before he had rashly married a wife.There are men whom a merciful Providence has undoubtedly ordained to a single life, but who from wilfulness or through circumstances they could not cope with have fown in the face of its decrees.There is no object more deserving of pity than the married bachelor.Of such was Captain Nichols.I met his wife.She was a woman of twenty-eight, I should think, though of a type whose age is always doubtful；for she cannot have looked different when she was twenty, and at forty would look no older.She gave me an impression of extraordinary tightness.Her plain face with its narrow lips was tight, her skin was stretched tightly over her bones, her smile was tight, her hair was tight, her clothes were tight, and the white drill she wore had all the effect of black bombazine.I could not imagine why Captain Nichols had married her, and having married her why he had not deserted her.Perhaps he had, often, and his melancholy arose from the fact that he could never succeed.However far he went and in howsoever secret a place he hid himself, I felt sure that Mrs.Nichols, inexorable as fate and remorseless as conscience, would presently rejoin him.He could as little escape her as the cause can escape the effect.

The rogue, like the artist and perhaps the gentleman, belongs to no class. He is not embarrassed by the sans-gêne of the hobo, nor put out of countenance by the etiquette of the prince.But Mrs.Nichols belonged to the well-defned class, of late become vocal, which is known as the lower-middle.Her father, in fact, was a policeman.I am certain that he was an effcient one.I do not know what her hold was on the Captain, but I do not think it was love.I never heard her speak, but it may be that in private she had a copious conversation.At any rate, Captain Nichols was frightened to death of her.Sometimes, sitting with me on the terrace of the hotel, he would become conscious that she was walking in the road outside.She did not call him；she gave no sign that she was aware of his existence；she merely walked up and down composedly.Then a strange uneasiness would seize the Captain；he would look at his watch and sigh.

“Well, I must be off，”he said.

Neither wit nor whisky could detain him then. Yet he was a man who had faced undaunted hurricane and typhoon, and would not have hesitated to fght a dozen unarmed niggers with nothing but a revolver to help him.Sometimes Mrs.Nichols would send her daughter, a pale-faced, sullen child of seven, to the hotel.

“Mother wants you，”she said, in a whining tone.

“Very well, my dear，”said Captain Nichols.

He rose to his feet at once, and accompanied his daughter along the road. I suppose it was a very pretty example of the triumph of spirit over matter, and so my digression has at least the advantage of a moral.





Chapter XLVII


I have tried to put some connexion into the various things Captain Nichols told me about Strickland, and I here set them down in the best order I can. They made one another's acquaintance during the latter part of the winter following my last meeting with Strickland in Paris.How he had passed the intervening months I do not know, but life must have been very hard, for Captain Nichols saw him frst in the Asile de Nuit.There was a strike at Marseilles at the time, and Strickland, having come to the end of his resources, had apparently found it impossible to earn the small sum he needed to keep body and soul together.

The Asile de Nuit is a large stone building where pauper and vagabond may get a bed for a week, provided their papers are in order and they can persuade the friars in charge that they are working-men. Captain Nichols noticed Strickland for his size and his singular appearance among the crowd that waited for the doors to open；they waited listlessly, some walking to and fro, some leaning against the wall, and others seated on the kerb with their feet in the gutter；and when they fled into the offce he heard the monk who read his papers address him in English.But he did not have a chance to speak to him, since, as he entered the common-room, a monk came in with a huge Bible in his arms, mounted a pulpit which was at the end of the room， and began the service which the wretched outcasts had to endure as the price of their lodging.He and Strickland were assigned to different rooms, and when, thrown out of bed at fve in the morning by a stalwart monk, he had made his bed and washed his face, Strickland had already disappeared.Captain Nichols wandered about the streets for an hour of bitter cold, and then made his way to the Place Victor Gélu, where the sailor-men are wont to congregate.Dozing against the pedestal of a statue, he saw Strickland again.He gave him a kick to awaken him.

“Come and have breakfast, mate，”he said.

“Go to hell，”answered Strickland.

I recognized my friend's limited vocabulary, and I prepared to regard Captain Nichols as a trustworthy witness.

“Busted？”asked the Captain.

“Blast you，”answered Strickland.

“Come along with me. I'll get you some breakfast.”

After a moment's hesitation, Strickland scrambled to his feet, and together they went to the Bouchée de Pain, where the hungry are given a wedge of bread, which they must eat there and then, for it is forbidden to take it away；and then to the Cuillère de Soupe, where for a week, at eleven and four, you may get a bowl of thin, salt soup.The two buildings are placed far apart, so that only the starving should be tempted to make use of them.So they had breakfast, and so began the queer companionship of Charles Strickland and Captain Nichols.

They must have spent something like four months at Marseilles in one another's society. Their career was devoid of adventure, if by adventure you mean unexpected or thrilling incident, for their days were occupied in the pursuit of enough money to get a night's lodging and such food as would stay the pangs of hunger.But I wish I could give here the pictures, coloured and racy, which Captain Nichols'vivid narrative offered to the imagination.His account of their discoveries in the low life of a seaport town would have made a charming book, and in the various characters that came their way the student might easily have found matter for a very complete dictionary of rogues.But I must content myself with a few paragraphs.I received the impression of a life intense and brutal, savage, multi-coloured, and vivacious.It made the Marseilles that I knew, gesticulating and sunny, with its comfortable hotels and its restaurants crowded with the well-to-do, tame and commonplace.I envied men who had seen with their own eyes the sights that Captain Nichols described.

When the doors of the Asile de Nuit were closed to them, Strickland and Captain Nichols sought the hospitality of Tough Bill. This was the master of a sailors'boarding-house, a huge mulatto with a heavy fst, who gave the stranded mariner food and shelter till he found him a berth.They lived with him a month, sleeping with a dozen others, Swedes, Negroes, Brazilians, on the foor of the two bare rooms in his house which he assigned to his charges；and every day they went with him to the Place Victor Gélu, whither came ships’captains in search of a man.He was married to an American woman, obese and slatternly, fallen to this pass by Heaven knows what process of degradation, and every day the boarders took it in turns to help her with the housework.Captain Nichols looked upon it as a smart piece of work on Strickland’s part that he had got out of this by painting a portrait of Tough Bill.Tough Bill not only paid for the canvas, colours, and brushes, but gave Strickland a pound of smuggled tobacco into the bargain.For all I know, this picture may still adorn the parlour of the tumble-down little house somewhere near the Quai de la Joliette, and I suppose it could now be sold for fifteen hundred pounds.Strickland’s idea was to ship on some vessel bound for Australia or New Zealand, and from there make his way to Samoa or Tahiti.I do not know how he had come upon the notion of going to the South Seas, though I remember that his imagination had long been haunted by an island, all green and sunny, encircled by a sea more blue than is found in Northern latitudes.I suppose that he clung to Captain Nichols because he was acquainted with those parts, and it was Captain Nichols who persuaded him that he would be more comfortable in Tahiti.

“You see, Tahiti's French，”he explained to me.“And the French aren't so damned technical.”

I thought I saw his point.

Strickland had no papers, but that was not a matter to disconcert Tough Bill when he saw a profit（he took the first month's wages of the sailor for whom he found a berth），and he provided Strickland with those of an English stoker who had providentially died on his hands. But both Captain Nichols and Strickland were bound East, and it chanced that the only opportunities for signing on were with ships sailing West.Twice Strickland refused a berth on tramps sailing for the United States, and once on a collier going to Newcastle.Tough Bill had no patience with an obstinacy which could only result in loss to himself, and on the last occasion he flung both Strickland and Captain Nichols out of his house without more ado.They found themselves once more adrift.

Tough Bill's fare was seldom extravagant, and you rose from his table almost as hungry as you sat down, but for some days they had good reason to regret it. They learned what hunger was.The Cuillère de Soupe and the Asile de Nuit were both closed to them, and their only sustenance was the wedge of bread which the Bouchée de Pain provided.They slept where they could, sometimes in an empty truck on a siding near the station, sometimes in a cart behind a warehouse；but it was bitterly cold, and after an hour or two of uneasy dozing they would tramp the streets again.What they felt the lack of most bitterly was tobacco, and Captain Nichols, for his part, could not do without it；he took to hunting the“Can o’Beer”for cigarette-ends and the butt-ends of cigars which the promenaders of the night before had thrown away.

“I've tasted worse smoking mixtures in a pipe，”he added, with a philosophic shrug of his shoulders, as he took a couple of cigars from the case I offered him, putting one in his mouth and the other in his pocket.

Now and then they made a bit of money. Sometimes a mail steamer would come in, and Captain Nichols, having scraped acquaintance with the time-keeper, would succeed in getting the pair of them a job as stevedores.When it was an English boat, they would dodge into the forecastle and get a hearty breakfast from the crew.They took the risk of running against one of the ship's offcers and being hustled down the gangway with the toe of a boot to speed their going.

“There's no harm in a kick in the hindquarters when your belly's full，”said Captain Nichols，“and personally I never take it in bad part. An offcer's got to think about discipline.”

I had a lively picture of Captain Nichols fying headlong down a narrow gangway before the uplifted foot of an angry mate, and, like a true Englishman, rejoicing in the spirit of the Mercantile Marine.

There were often odd jobs to be got about the fsh-market. Once they each of them earned a franc by loading trucks with innumerable boxes of oranges that had been dumped down on the quay.One day they had a stroke of luck：one of the boarding-masters got a contract to paint a tramp that had come in from Madagascar round the Cape of Good Hope, and they spent several days on a plank hanging over the side, covering the rusty hull with paint.It was a situation that must have appealed to Strickland's sardonic humour.I asked Captain Nichols how he bore himself during these hardships.

“Never knew him say a cross word，”answered the Captain.“He'd be a bit surly sometimes, but when we hadn't a bite since morning, and we hadn't even got the price of a lie down at the Chink's, he'd be as lively as a cricket.”

I was not surprised at this. Strickland was just the man to rise superior to circumstances, when they were such as to occasion despondency in most；but whether this was due to equanimity of soul or to contradictoriness it would be diffcult to say.

The Chink's Head was the name the beach-combers gave to a wretched inn off the Rue Bouterie, kept by a one-eyed Chinaman, where for six sous you could sleep in a cot and for three on the floor. Here they made friends with others in as desperate condition as themselves, and when they were penniless and the night was bitter cold, they were glad to borrow from anyone who had earned a stray franc during the day the price of a roof over their heads.They were not niggardly, these tramps, and he who had money did not hesitate to share it among the rest.They belonged to all the countries in the world, but this was no bar to good-fellowship；for they felt themselves freemen of a country whose frontiers include them all, the great country of Cockaigne.

“But I guess Strickland was an ugly customer when he was roused，”said Captain Nichols, refectively.“One day we ran into Tough Bill in the Place, and he asked Charlie for the papers he'd given him.”

“‘You'd better come and take them if you want them，'says Charlie.

“He was a powerful fellow, Tough Bill, but he didn't quite like the look of Charlie, so he began cursing him. He called him pretty near every name he could lay hands on, and when Tough Bill began cursing it was worth listening to him.Well, Charlie stuck it for a bit, then he stepped forward and he just said：‘Get out, you bloody swine.'It wasn't so much what he said, but the way he said it.Tough Bill never spoke another word；you could see him go yellow, and he walked away as if he'd remembered he had a date.”

Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading I have thought it better, at the expense of truth, to put into his mouth expressions familiar to the domestic circle.

Now, Tough Bill was not the man to put up with humiliation at the hands of a common sailor. His power depended on his prestige, and frst one, then another, of the sailors who lived in his house told them that he had sworn to do Strickland in.

One night Captain Nichols and Strickland were sitting in one of the bars of the Rue Bouterie. The Rue Bouterie is a narrow street of one-storeyed houses, each house consisting of but one room；they are like booths in a crowded fair or the cages of animals in a circus.At every door you see a woman.Some lean lazily against the side-posts, humming to themselves or calling to the passer-by in a raucous voice, and some listlessly read.They are French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, coloured；some are fat and some are thin；and under the thick paint on their faces, the heavy smears on their eyebrows, and the scarlet of their lips, you see the lines of age and the scars of dissipation.Some wear black shifts and fesh-coloured stockings；some with curly hair, dyed yellow, are dressed like little girls in short muslin frocks.Through the open door you see a red-tiled foor, a large wooden bed, and on a deal table a ewer and a basin.A motley crowd saunters along the streets-Lascars off a P.and O.，blond Northmen from a Swedish barque, Japanese from a man-of-war, English sailors, Spaniards, pleasant-looking fellows from a French cruiser, Negroes off an American tramp.By day it is merely sordid, but at night, lit only by the lamps in the little huts, the street has a sinister beauty.The hideous lust that pervades the air is oppressive and horrible, and yet there is something mysterious in the sight which haunts and troubles you.You feel I know not what primitive force which repels and yet fascinates you.Here all the decencies of civilization are swept away, and you feel that men are face to face with a sombre reality.There is an atmosphere that is at once intense and tragic.

In the bar in which Strickland and Nichols sat a mechanical piano was loudly grinding out dance music. Round the room people were sitting at tables, here half a dozen sailors uproariously drunk, there a group of soldiers；and in the middle, crowded together, couples were dancing.Bearded sailors with brown faces and large horny hands clasped their partners in a tight embrace.The women wore nothing but a shift.Now and then two sailors would get up and dance together.The noise was deafening.People were singing, shouting, laughing；and when a man gave a long kiss to the girl sitting on his knees, cat-calls from the English sailors increased the din.The air was heavy with the dust beaten up by the heavy boots of the men, and grey with smoke.It was very hot.Behind the bar was seated a woman nursing her baby.The waiter, an undersized youth with a fat, spotty face, hurried to and fro carrying a tray laden with glasses of beer.

In a little while Tough Bill, accompanied by two huge Negroes, came in, and it was easy to see that he was already three parts drunk. He was looking for trouble. He lurched against a table at which three soldiers were sitting and knocked over a glass of beer.There was an angry altercation, and the owner of the bar stepped forward and ordered Tough Bill to go.He was a hefty fellow, in the habit of standing no nonsense from his customers, and Tough Bill hesitated.The landlord was not a man he cared to tackle, for the police were on his side, and with an oath he turned on his heel.Suddenly he caught sight of Strickland.He rolled up to him.He did not speak.He gathered the spittle in his mouth and spat full in Strickland's face.Strickland seized his glass and fung it at him.The dancers stopped suddenly still.There was an instant of complete silence, but when Tough Bill threw himself on Strickland the lust of battle seized them all, and in a moment there was a confused scrimmage.Tables were overturned, glasses crashed to the ground.There was a hellish row.The women scattered to the door and behind the bar.Passers-by surged in from the street.You heard curses in every tongue, the sound of blows, cries；and in the middle of the room a dozen men were fghting with all their might.On a sudden the police rushed in, and everyone who could made for the door.When the bar was more or less cleared, Tough Bill was lying insensible on the foor with a great gash in his head.Captain Nichols dragged Strickland, bleeding from a wound in his arm, his clothes in rags, into the street.His own face was covered with blood from a blow on the nose.

“I guess you'd better get out of Marseilles before Tough Bill comes out of hospital，”he said to Strickland, when they had got back to the Chink's Head and were cleaning themselves.

“This beats cock-fghting，”said Strickland.

I could see his sardonic smile.

Captain Nichols was anxious. He knew Tough Bill's vindictiveness. Strickland had downed the mulatto twice, and the mulatto, sober, was a man to be reckoned with.He would bide his time stealthily.He would be in no hurry, but one night Strickland would get a knife-thrust in his back, and in a day or two the corpse of a nameless beachcomber would be fshed out of the dirty water of the harbour.Nichols went next evening to Tough Bill's house and made inquiries.He was in hospital still, but his wife, who had been to see him, said he was swearing hard to kill Strickland when they let him out.

A week passed.

“That's what I always say，”refected Captain Nichols，“when you hurt a man, hurt him bad. It gives you a bit of time to look about and think what you'll do next.”

Then Strickland had a bit of luck. A ship bound for Australia had sent to the Sailors'Home for a stoker in place of one who had thrown himself overboard off Gibraltar in an attack of delirium tremens.

“You double down to the harbour, my lad，”said the Captain to Strickland，“and sign on. You've got your papers.”

Strickland set off at once, and that was the last Captain Nichols saw of him. The ship was only in port for six hours, and in the evening Captain Nichols watched the vanishing smoke from her funnels as she ploughed East through the wintry sea.

I have narrated all this as best I could, because I like the contrast of these episodes with the life that I had seen Strickland live in Ashley Gardens when he was occupied with stocks and shares；but I am aware that Captain Nichols was an outrageous liar, and I dare say there is not a word of truth in anything he told me. I should not be surprised to learn that he had never seen Strickland in his life, and owed his knowledge of Marseilles to the pages of a magazine.





Chapter XLVIII


It is here that I purposed to end my book. My first idea was to begin it with the account of Strickland's last years in Tahiti and with his horrible death, and then to go back and relate what I knew of his beginnings.This I meant to do, not from wilfulness, but because I wished to leave Strickland setting out with I know not what fancies in his lonely soul for the unknown islands which fred his imagination.I liked the picture of him, starting at the age of forty-seven, when most men have already settled comfortably in a groove, for a new world.I saw him, the sea grey under the mistral and foam-fecked, watching the vanishing coast of France, which he was destined never to see again；and I thought there was something gallant in his bearing and dauntless in his soul.I wished so to end on a note of hope.It seemed to emphasize the unconquerable spirit of man.But I could not manage it.Somehow I could not get into my story, and after trying once or twice I had to give it up；I started from the beginning in the usual way, and made up my mind I could only tell what I knew of Strickland's life in the order in which I learnt the facts.

Those that I have now are fragmentary. I am in the position of a biologist who from a single bone must reconstruct not only the appearance of an extinct animal, but its habits.Strickland made no particular impression on the people who came in contact with him in Tahiti.To them he was no more than a beach-comber in constant need of money, remarkable only for the peculiarity that he painted pictures which seemed to them absurd；and it was not till he had been dead for some years and agents came from the dealers in Paris and Berlin to look for any pictures which might still remain on the island, that they had any idea that among them had dwelt a man of consequence.They remembered then that they could have bought for a song canvases which now were worth large sums, and they could not forgive themselves for the opportunity which had escaped them.There was a Jewish trader called Cohen, who had come by one of Strickland's pictures in a singular way.He was a little old Frenchman, with soft kind eyes and a pleasant smile, half trader and half seaman, who owned a cutter in which he wandered boldly among the Paumotus and the Marquesas, taking out trade goods and bringing back copra, shell, and pearls.I went to see him because I was told he had a large black pearl which he was willing to sell cheaply, and when I discovered that it was beyond my means I began to talk to him about Strickland.He had known him well.

“You see, I was interested in him because he was a painter，”he told me.“We don't get many painters in the islands, and I was sorry for him because he was such a bad one. I gave him his frst job.I had a plantation on the peninsula, and I wanted a white overseer.You never get any work out of the natives unless you have a white man over them.I said to him：‘You'll have plenty of time for painting, and you can earn a bit of money.'I knew he was starving, but I offered him good wages.”

“I can't imagine that he was a very satisfactory overseer，”I said, smiling.

“I made allowances. I have always had a sympathy for artists.It is in our blood, you know.But he only remained a few months.When he had enough money to buy paints and canvases he left me.The place had got hold of him by then, and he wanted to get away into the bush.But I continued to see him now and then.He would turn up in Papeete every few months and stay a little while；he'd get money out of someone or other and then disappear again.It was on one of these visits that he came to me and asked for the loan of two hundred francs.He looked as if he hadn't had a meal for a week, and I hadn't the heart to refuse him.Of course, I never expected to see my money again.Well, a year later he came to see me once more, and he brought a picture with him.He did not mention the money he owed me, but he said：'Here is a picture of your plantation that I've painted for you.’I looked at it.I did not know what to say, but of course I thanked him, and when he had gone away I showed it to my wife.”

“What was it like？”I asked.

“Do not ask me. I could not make head or tail of it.I never saw such a thing in my life.‘What shall we do with it？'I said to my wife.‘We can never hang it up，'she said.‘People would laugh at us.'So she took it into an attic and put it away with all sorts of rubbish, for my wife can never throw anything away.It is her mania.Then, imagine to yourself, just before the war my brother wrote to me from Paris, and said：‘Do you know anything about an English painter who lived in Tahiti？It appears that he was a genius, and his pictures fetch large prices.See if you can lay your hands on anything and send it to me.There's money to be made.'So I said to my wife：‘What about that picture that Strickland gave me？’Is it possible that it is still in the attic？’‘Without doubt，’she answered，‘for you know that I never throw anything away.It is my mania.’We went up to the attic, and there, among I know not what rubbish that had been gathered during the thirty years we have inhabited that house, was the picture.I looked at it again, and I said：‘Who would have thought that the overseer of my plantation on the peninsula, to whom I lent two hundred francs, had genius？Do you see anything in the picture？’‘No，’she said，‘it does not resemble the plantation and I have never seen coconuts with blue leaves；but they are mad in Paris, and it may be that your brother will be able to sell it for the two hundred francs you lent Strickland.’Well, we packed it up and we sent it to my brother.And at last I received a letter from him.What do you think he said？‘I received your picture，’he said，‘and I confess I thought it was a joke that you had played on me.I would not have given the cost of postage for the picture.I was half afraid to show it to the gentleman who had spoken to me about it.Imagine my surprise when he said it was a masterpiece, and offered me thirty thousand francs.I dare say he would have paid more, but frankly I was so taken aback that I lost my head；I accepted the offer before I was able to collect myself.’”

Then Monsieur Cohen said an admirable thing.

“I wish that poor Strickland had been still alive. I wonder what he would have said when I gave him twenty-nine thousand eight hundred francs for his picture.”





Chapter XLIX


I lived at the H?tel de la Fleur, and Mrs.Johnson, the proprietress, had a sad story to tell of lost opportunity.After Strickland’s death certain of his effects were sold by auction in the market-place at Papeete, and she went to it herself because there was among the truck an American stove she wanted.She paid twenty-seven francs for it.

“There were a dozen pictures，”she told me，“but they were unframed, and nobody wanted them. Some of them sold for as much as ten francs, but mostly they went for fve or six.Just think, if I had bought them I should be a rich woman now.”

But Tiaré Johnson would never under any circumstances have been rich.She could not keep money.The daughter of a native and an English sea-captain settled in Tahiti, when I knew her she was a woman of fifty, who looked older, and of enormous proportions.Tall and extremely stout, she would have been of imposing presence if the great good-nature of her face had not made it impossible for her to express anything but kindliness.Her arms were like legs of mutton, her breasts like giant cabbages；her face, broad and feshy, gave you an impression of almost indecent nakedness, and vast chin succeeded to vast chin.I do not know how many of them there were.They fell away voluminously into the capaciousness of her bosom.She was dressed usually in a pink Mother Hubbard, and she wore all day long a large straw hat.But when she let down her hair, which she did now and then, for she was vain of it, you saw that it was long and dark and curly；and her eyes had remained young and vivacious.Her laughter was the most catching I ever heard；it would begin, a low peal in her throat, and would grow louder and louder till her whole vast body shook.She loved three things-a joke, a glass of wine, and a handsome man.To have known her is a privilege.

She was the best cook on the island, and she adored good food. From morning till night you saw her sitting on a low chair in the kitchen, surrounded by a Chinese cook and two or three native girls, giving her orders, chatting sociably with all and sundry, and tasting the savoury messes she devised.When she wished to do honour to a friend she cooked the dinner with her own hands.Hospitality was a passion with her, and there was no one on the island who need go without a dinner when there was anything to eat at the H?tel de la Fleur.She never turned her customers out of her house because they did not pay their bills.She always hoped they would pay when they could.There was one man there who had fallen on adversity, and to him she had given board and lodging for several months.When the Chinese laundryman refused to wash for him without payment she had sent his things to be washed with hers.She could not allow the poor fellow to go about in a dirty shirt, she said, and since he was a man, and men must smoke, she gave him a franc a day for cigarettes.She used him with the same affability as those of her clients who paid their bills once a week.

Age and obesity had made her inapt for love, but she took a keen interest in the amatory affairs of the young. She looked upon venery as the natural occupation for men and women, and was ever ready with precept and example from her own wide experience.

“I was not fifteen when my father found that I had a lover，”she said.“He was third mate on the Tropic Bird. A good-looking boy.”

She sighed a little. They say a woman always remembers her frst lover with affection；but perhaps she does not always remember him.

“My father was a sensible man.”

“What did he do？”I asked.

“He thrashed me within an inch of my life, and then he made me marry Captain Johnson. I did not mind.He was older, of course, but he was good-looking too.”

Tiaré-her father had called her by the name of the white, scented fower which, they tell you, if you have once smelt, will always draw you back to Tahiti in the end, however far you may have roamed-Tiaré remembered Strickland very well.

“He used to come here sometimes, and I used to see him walking about Papeete. I was sorry for him, he was so thin, and he never had any money.When I heard he was in town, I used to send a boy to fnd him and make him come to dinner with me.I got him a job once or twice, but he couldn't stick to anything.After a little while he wanted to get back to the bush, and one morning he would be gone.”

Strickland reached Tahiti about six months after he left Marseilles. He worked his passage on a sailing vessel that was making the trip from Auckland to San Francisco, and he arrived with a box of paints, an easel, and a dozen canvases.He had a few pounds in his pocket, for he had found work in Sydney, and he took a small room in a native house outside the town.I think the moment he reached Tahiti he felt himself at home.Tiaré told me that he said to her once：

“I'd been scrubbing the deck, and all at once a chap said to me：‘Why, there it is.'And I looked up and I saw the outline of the island. I knew right away that there was the place I'd been looking for all my life.Then we came near, and I seemed to recognize it.Sometimes when I walk about it all seems familiar.I could swear I've lived here before.”

“Sometimes it takes them like that，”said Tiaré.“I’ve known men come on shore for a few hours while their ship was taking in cargo, and never go back.And I’ve known men who came here to be in an offce for a year, and they cursed the place, and when they went away they took their dying oath they’d hang themselves before they came back again, and in six months you’d see them land once more, and they’d tell you they couldn’t live anywhere else.”





Chapter L


I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not.They are strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage.They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known.Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves.Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history.Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels that he belongs.Here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth.Here at last he fnds rest.

I told Tiaré the story of a man I had known at St.Thomas’s Hospital.He was a Jew named Abraham, a blond, rather stout young man, shy and very unassuming；but he had remarkable gifts.He entered the hospital with a scholarship, and during the fve years of the curriculum gained every prize that was open to him.He was made house-physician and house-surgeon.His brilliance was allowed by all.Finally he was elected to a position on the staff, and his career was assured.So far as human things can be predicted, it was certain that he would rise to the greatest heights of his profession.Honours and wealth awaited him.Before he entered upon his new duties he wished to take a holiday, and, having no private means, he went as surgeon on a tramp steamer to the Levant.It did not generally carry a doctor, but one of the senior surgeons at the hospital knew a director of the line, and Abraham was taken as a favour.

In a few weeks the authorities received his resignation of the coveted position on the staff. It created profound astonishment, and wild rumours were current.Whenever a man does anything unexpected, his fellows ascribe it to the most discreditable motives.But there was a man ready to step into Abraham's shoes, and Abraham was forgotten.Nothing more was heard of him.He vanished.

It was perhaps ten years later that one morning on board ship, about to land at Alexandria, I was bidden to line up with the other passengers for the doctor's examination. The doctor was a stout man in shabby clothes, and when he took off his hat I noticed that he was very bald.I had an idea that I had seen him before.Suddenly I remembered.

“Abraham，”I said.

He turned to me with a puzzled look, and then, recognizing me, seized my hand. After expressions of surprise on either side, hearing that I meant to spend the night in Alexandria, he asked me to dine with him at the English Club.When we met again I declared my astonishment at finding him there.It was a very modest position that he occupied, and there was about him an air of straitened circumstance.Then he told me his story.When he set out on his holiday in the Mediterranean he had every intention of returning to London and his appointment at St. Thomas's.One morning the tramp docked at Alexandria, and from the deck he looked at the city, white in the sunlight, and the crowd on the wharf；he saw the natives in their shabby gabardines, the blacks from the Sudan, the noisy throng of Greeks and Italians, the grave Turks in tarbooshes, the sunshine and the blue sky；and something happened to him.He could not describe it.It was like a thunder-clap, he said, and then, dissatisfed with this, he said it was like a revelation.Something seemed to twist his heart, and suddenly he felt an exultation, a sense of wonderful freedom.He felt himself at home, and he made up his mind there and then, in a minute, that he would live the rest of his life in Alexandria.He had no great difficulty in leaving the ship, and in twenty-four hours, with all his belongings, he was on shore.

“The Captain must have thought you as mad as a hatter，”I smiled.

“I didn't care what anybody thought. It wasn't I that acted, but something stronger within me.I thought I would go to a little Greek hotel, while I looked about, and I felt I knew where to find one.And do you know, I walked straight there, and when I saw it I recognized it at once.”

“Had you been to Alexandria before？”

“No；I'd never been out of England in my life.”

Presently he entered the Government service, and there he had been ever since.

“Have you never regretted it？”

“Never, not for a minute. I earn just enough to live upon, and I'm satisfed.I ask nothing more than to remain as I am till I die.I've had a wonderful life.”

I left Alexandria next day, and I forgot about Abraham till a little while ago, when I was dining with another old friend in the profession, Alec Carmichael, who was in England on short leave. I ran across him in the street and congratulated him on the knighthood with which his eminent services during the war had been rewarded.We arranged to spend an evening together for old time's sake, and when I agreed to dine with him, he proposed that he should ask nobody else, so that we could chat without interruption.He had a beautiful old house in Queen Anne Street, and being a man of taste he had furnished it admirably.On the walls of the dining-room I saw a charming Bellotto, and there was a pair of Zoffanys that I envied.When his wife, a tall, lovely creature in cloth of gold, had left us, I remarked laughingly on the change in his present circumstances from those when we had both been medical students.We had looked upon it then as an extravagance to dine in a shabby Italian restaurant in the Westminster Bridge Road.Now Alec Carmichael was on the staff of half a dozen hospitals.I should think he earned ten thousand a year, and his knighthood was but the frst of the honours which must inevitably fall to his lot.

“I've done pretty well，”he said，“but the strange thing is that I owe it all to one piece of luck.”

“What do you mean by that？”

“Well, do you remember Abraham？He was the man who had the future. When we were students he beat me all along the line.He got the prizes and the scholarships that I went in for.I always played second fddle to him.If he'd kept on he'd be in the position I'm in now.That man had a genius for surgery.No one had a look in with him.When he was appointed Registrar at St.Thomas's I hadn't a chance of getting on the staff.I should have had to become a G.P.，and you know what likelihood there is for a G.P.ever to get out of the common rut.But Abraham fell out, and I got the job.That gave me my opportunity.”

“I dare say that's true.”

“It was just luck. I suppose there was some kink in Abraham.Poor devil, he's gone to the dogs altogether.He's got some twopenny-halfpenny job in the medical at Alexandria-sanitary officer or something like that.I'm told he lives with an ugly old Greek woman and has half a dozen scrofulous kids.The fact is, I suppose, that it's not enough to have brains.The thing that counts is character.Abraham hadn't got character.”

Character？I should have thought it needed a good deal of character to throw up a career after half an hour's meditation, because you saw in another way of living a more intense signifcance. And it required still more character never to regret the sudden step.But I said nothing, and Alec Carmichael proceeded refectively：

“Of course it would be hypocritical for me to pretend that I regret what Abraham did. After all, I've scored by it.”He puffed luxuriously at the long Corona he was smoking.“But if I weren't personally concerned I should be sorry at the waste.It seems a rotten thing that a man should make such a hash of life.”

I wondered if Abraham really had made a hash of life. Is to do what you most want, to live under the conditions that please you, in peace with yourself, to make a hash of life；and is it success to be an eminent surgeon with ten thousand a year and a beautiful wife？I suppose it depends on what meaning you attach to life, the claim which you acknowledge to society, and the claim of the individual.But again I held my tongue, for who am I to argue with a knight？





Chapter LI


Tiaré，when I told her this story, praised my prudence, and for a few minutes we worked in silence, for we were shelling peas.Then her eyes, always alert for the affairs of her kitchen, fell on some action of the Chinese cook which aroused her violent disapproval.She turned on him with a torrent of abuse.The Chink was not backward to defend himself, and a very lively quarrel ensued.They spoke in the native language, of which I had learnt but half a dozen words, and it sounded as though the world would shortly come to an end；but presently peace was restored and Tiaré gave the cook a cigarette.They both smoked comfortably.

“Do you know, it was I who found him his wife？”said Tiaré suddenly, with a smile spread all over her immense face.

“The cook？”

“No, Strickland.”

“But he had one already.”

“That is what he said, but I told him she was in England, and England is at the other end of the world.”

“True，”I replied.

“He would come to Papeete every two or three months, when he wanted paints or tobacco or money, and then he would wander about like a lost dog. I was sorry for him.I had a girl here then called Ata to do the rooms；she was some sort of a relation of mine, and her father and mother were dead, so I had her to live with me.Strickland used to come here now and then to have a square meal or to play chess with one of the boys.I noticed that she looked at him when he came, and I asked her if she liked him.She said she liked him well enough.You know what these girls are；they're always pleased to go with a white man.”

“Was she a native？”I asked.

“Yes；she hadn't a drop of white blood in her. Well, after I'd talked to her I sent for Strickland, and I said to him：‘strickland, it's time for you to settle down.A man of your age shouldn't go playing about with the girls down at the front.They're bad lots, and you’ll come to no good with them.You’ve got no money, and you can never keep a job for more than a month or two.No one will employ you now.You say you can always live in the bush with one or other of the natives, and they’re glad to have you because you’re a white man, but it’s not decent for a white man.Now, listen to me, Strickland.’”

Tiaré mingled French with English in her conversation, for she used both languages with equal facility.She spoke them with a singing accent which was not unpleasing.You felt that a bird would speak in these tones if it could speak English.

“‘Now, what do you say to marrying Ata？She's a good girl and she's only seventeen. She's never been promiscuous like some of these girls-a captain or a frst mate, yes, but she's never been touched by a native.Elle se respecte, vois-tu.The purser of the Oahu told me last journey that he hadn't met a nicer girl in the islands.It’s time she settled down too, and besides, the captains and the first mates like a change now and then.I don’t keep my girls too long.She has a bit of property down by Taravao, just before you come to the peninsula, and with copra at the price it is now you could live quite comfortably.There’s a house, and you’d have all the time you wanted for your painting.What do you say to it？’”

Tiaré paused to take breath.

“It was then he told me of his wife in England.'my poor Strickland，'I said to him，'they've all got a wife somewhere；that is generally why they come to the islands. Ata is a sensible girl, and she doesn't expect any ceremony before the Mayor.She’s a Protestant, and you know they don’t look upon these things like the Catholics.’”

“Then he said：‘But what does Ata say to it？'‘It appears that she has a béguin for you，’I said.‘she’s willing if you are.Shall I call her？’He chuckled in a funny, dry way he had, and I called her.She knew what I was talking about, the hussy, and I saw her out of the corner of my eyes listening with all her ears, while she pretended to iron a blouse that she had been washing for me.She came.She was laughing, but I could see that she was a little shy, and Strickland looked at her without speaking.”

“Was she pretty？”I asked.

“Not bad. But you must have seen pictures of her.He painted her over and over again, sometimes with a pareo on and sometimes with nothing at all.Yes, she was pretty enough.And she knew how to cook.I taught her myself.I saw Strickland was thinking of it, so I said to him：‘I've given her good wages and she's saved them, and the captains and the frst mates she's known have given her a little something now and then.She's saved several hundred francs.'

“He pulled his great red beard and smiled.

“‘Well, Ata，'he said，'do you fancy me for a husband？'

“She did not say anything, but just giggled.

“‘But I tell you, my poor Strickland, the girl has a béguin for you，’I said.

“‘I shall beat you，'he said, looking at her.

“‘How else should I know you loved me，'she answered.”

Tiaré broke off her narrative and addressed herself to me refectively.

“My frst husband, Captain Johnson, used to thrash me regularly. He was a man.He was handsome, six foot three, and when he was drunk there was no holding him.I would be black and blue all over for days at a time.Oh, I cried when he died.I thought I should never get over it.But it wasn't till I married George Rainey that I knew what I'd lost.You can never tell what a man is like till you live with him.I've never been so deceived in a man as I was in George Rainey.He was a fne, upstanding fellow too.He was nearly as tall as Captain Johnson, and he looked strong enough.But it was all on the surface.He never drank.He never raised his hand to me.He might have been a missionary.I made love with the offcers of every ship that touched at the island, and George Rainey never saw anything.At last I was disgusted with him, and I got a divorce.What was the good of a husband like that？It's a terrible thing the way some men treat women.”

I condoled with Tiaré，and remarked feelingly that men were deceivers ever, then asked her to go on with her story of Strickland.

“‘Well，'I said to him，'there's no hurry about it. Take your time and think it over.Ata has a very nice room in the annexe.Live with her for a month, and see how you like her.You can have your meals here.And at the end of a month, if you decide you want to marry her, you can just go and settle down on her property.'

“Well, he agreed to that. Ata continued to do the housework, and I gave him his meals as I said I would.I taught Ata how to make one or two dishes I knew he was fond of.He did not paint much.He wandered about the hills and bathed in the stream.And he sat about the front looking at the lagoon, and at sunset he would go down and look at Murea.He used to go fishing on the reef.He loved to moon about the harbour talking to the natives.He was a nice, quiet fellow.And every evening after dinner he would go down to the annexe with Ata.I saw he was longing to get away to the bush, and at the end of the month I asked him what he intended to do.He said if Ata was willing to go, he was willing to go with her.So I gave them a wedding dinner.I cooked it with my own hands.I gave them a pea soup and lobster à la portugaise, and a curry, and a coconut salad-you’ve never had one of my coconut salads, have you？I must make you one before you go-and then I made them an ice.We had all the champagne we could drink and liqueurs to follow.Oh, I’d made up my mind to do things well.And afterwards we danced in the drawing-room.I was not so fat, then, and I always loved dancing.”

The drawing-room at the H?tel de la Fleur was a small room, with a cottage piano, and a suite of mahogany furniture, covered in stamped velvet, neatly arranged round the walls.On round tables were photograph albums, and on the walls enlarged photographs of Tiaré and her first husband, Captain Johnson.Still, though Tiaré was old and fat, on occasion we rolled back the Brussels carpet, brought in the maids and one or two friends of Tiaré’s, and danced, though now to the wheezy music of a gramophone.On the veranda the air was scented with the heavy perfume of the tiaré，and overhead the Southern Cross shone in a cloudless sky.

Tiaré smiled indulgently as she remembered the gaiety of a time long passed.

“We kept it up till three, and when we went to bed I don't think anyone was very sober. I had told them they could have my trap to take them as far as the road went, because after that they had a long walk.Ata's property was right away in a fold of the mountain.They started at dawn, and the boy I sent with them didn't come back till next day.

“Yes, that's how Strickland was married.”





Chapter LII


I suppose the next three years were the happiest of Strickland's life. Ata's house stood about eight kilometres from the road that runs round the island, and you went to it along a winding pathway shaded by the luxuriant trees of the tropics.It was a bungalow of unpainted wood, consisting of two small rooms, and outside was a small shed that served as a kitchen.There was no furniture except the mats they used as beds and a rocking-chair, which stood on the veranda.Bananas with their great ragged leaves, like the tattered habiliments of an empress in adversity, grew close up to the house.There was a tree just behind which bore alligator pears, and all about were the coconuts which gave the land its revenue.Ata's father had planted crotons round his property, and they grew in coloured profusion, gay and brilliant；they fenced the land with fame.A mango grew in front of the house, and at the edge of the clearing were two famboyants, twin trees, that challenged the gold of the coconuts with their scarlet fowers.

Here Strickland lived, coming seldom to Papeete, on the produce of the land. There was a little stream that ran not far away, in which he bathed, and down this on occasion would come a shoal of fish.Then the natives would assemble with spears, and with much shouting would transfx the great startled things as they hurried down to the sea. Sometimes Strickland would go down to the reef, and come back with a basket of small, coloured fsh that Ata would fry in coconut oil, or with a lobster；and sometimes she would make a savoury dish of the great land-crabs that scuttled away under your feet.Up the mountain were wild-orange trees, and now and then Ata would go with two or three women from the village and return laden with the green, sweet, luscious fruit.Then the coconuts would be ripe for picking, and her cousins（like all the natives, Ata had a host of relatives）would swarm up the trees and throw down the big ripe nuts.They split them open and put them in the sun to dry.Then they cut out the copra and put it into sacks, and the women would carry it down to the trader at the village by the lagoon, and he would give in exchange for it rice and soap and tinned meat and a little money.Sometimes there would be a feast in the neighbourhood, and a pig would be killed.Then they would go and eat themselves sick, and dance, and sing hymns.

But the house was a long way from the village, and the Tahitians are lazy. They love to travel and they love to gossip, but they do not care to walk, and for weeks at a time Strickland and Ata lived alone.He painted and he read, and in the evening, when it was dark, they sat together on the veranda, smoking and looking at the night.Then Ata had a baby, and the old woman who came up to help her through her trouble stayed on.Presently the grand-daughter of the old woman came to stay with her, and then a youth appeared-no one quite knew where from or to whom he belonged-but he settled down with them in a happy-go-lucky way, and they all lived together.





Chapter LIII


“Tenez, voilà le Capitaine Brunot，”said Tiaré，one day when I was fitting together what she could tell me of Strickland.“He knew Strickland well；he visited him at his house.”

I saw a middle-aged Frenchman with a big black beard, streaked with grey, a sunburned face, and large, shining eyes. He was dressed in a neat suit of ducks.I had noticed him at luncheon, and Ah Lin, the Chinese boy, told me he had come from the Paumotus on the boat that had that day arrived.Tiaré introduced me to him, and he handed me his card, a large card on which was printed René Brunot, and underneath, Capitaine au Long Cours.We were sitting on a little veranda outside the kitchen, and Tiaré was cutting out a dress that she was making for one of the girls about the house.He sat down with us.

“Yes；I knew Strickland well，”he said.“I am very fond of chess, and he was always glad of a game. I come to Tahiti three or four times a year for my business, and when he was at Papeete he would come here and we would play.When he married”-Captain Brunot smiled and shrugged his shoulders-“enfin, when he went to live with the girl that Tiaré gave him, he asked me to go and see him.I was one of the guests at the wedding feast.”He looked at Tiaré，and they both laughed.“He did not come much to Papeete after that, and about a year later it chanced that I had to go to that part of the island for I forget what business, and when I had fnished it I said to myself：‘Voyons, why should I not go and see that poor Strickland？’I asked one or two natives if they knew anything about him, and I discovered that he lived not more than fve kilometres from where I was.So, I went.I shall never forget the impression my visit made on me.I live on an atoll, a low island, it is a strip of land surrounding a lagoon, and its beauty is the beauty of the sea and sky, and the varied colour of the lagoon, and the grace of the coconut trees；but the place where Strickland lived had the beauty of the Garden of Eden.Ah, I wish I could make you see the enchantment of that spot, a corner hidden away from all the world, with the blue sky overhead and the rich, luxuriant trees.It was a feast of colour.And it was fragrant and cool.Words cannot describe that paradise.And here he lived, unmindful of the world and by the world forgotten.I suppose to European eyes it would have seemed astonishingly sordid.The house was dilapidated and none too clean.When I approached I saw three or four natives lying on the veranda.You know how natives love to herd together.There was a young man lying full length, smoking a cigarette, and he wore nothing but a pareo.”

The pareo is a long strip of trade cotton, red or blue, stamped with a white pattern. It is worn round the waist and hangs to the knees.

“A girl of ffteen, perhaps, was plaiting pandanus-leaf to make a hat, and an old woman was sitting on her haunches smoking a pipe. Then I saw Ata.She was suckling a new-born child, and another child, stark naked, was playing at her feet.When she saw me, she called out to Strickland, and he came to the door.He, too, wore nothing but a pareo.He was an extraordinary fgure, with his red beard and matted hair, and his great hairy chest.His feet were horny and scarred, so that I knew he went always barefoot.He had gone native with a vengeance.He seemed pleased to see me, and told Ata to kill a chicken for our dinner.He took me into the house to show me the picture he was at work on when I came in.In one corner of the room was the bed, and in the middle was an easel with the canvas upon it.Because I was sorry for him, I had bought a couple of his pictures for small sums, and I had sent others to friends of mine in France.And though I had bought them out of compassion, after living with them I began to like them.Indeed, I found a strange beauty in them.Everyone thought I was mad, but it turns out that I was right.I was his frst admirer in the islands.”

He smiled maliciously at Tiaré，and with lamentations she told us again the story of how at the sale of Strickland’s effects she had neglected the pictures, but bought an American stove for twenty-seven francs.

“Have you the pictures still？”I asked.

“Yes；I am keeping them till my daughter is of marriageable age, and then I shall sell them. They will be her dot.”

Then he went on with the account of his visit to Strickland.

“I shall never forget the evening I spent with him. I had not intended to stay more than an hour, but he insisted that I should spend the night.I hesitated, for I confess I did not much like the look of the mats on which he proposed that I should sleep；but I shrugged my shoulders.When I was building my house in the Paumotus I had slept out for weeks on a harder bed than that, with nothing to shelter me but wild shrubs；and as for vermin, my tough skin should be proof against their malice.

“We went down to the stream to bathe while Ata was preparing the dinner, and after we had eaten it we sat on the veranda. We smoked and chatted.The young man had a concertina, and he played the tunes popular on the music-halls a dozen years before.They sounded strangely in the tropical night thousands of miles from civilization.I asked Strickland if it did not irk him to live in that promiscuity.No, he said；he liked to have his models under his hand.Presently, after loud yawning, the natives went away to sleep, and Strickland and I were left alone.I cannot describe to you the intense silence of the night.On my island in the Paumotus there is never at night the complete stillness that there was here.There is the rustle of the myriad animals on the beach, all the little shelled things that crawl about ceaselessly, and there is the noisy scurrying of the land-crabs.Now and then in the lagoon you hear the leaping of a fsh, and sometimes a hurried noisy splashing as a brown shark sends all the other fsh scampering for their lives.And above all, ceaseless like time, is the dull roar of the breakers on the reef.But here there was not a sound, and the air was scented with the white fowers of the night.It was a night so beautiful that your soul seemed hardly able to bear the prison of the body.You felt that it was ready to be wafted away on the immaterial air, and death bore all the aspect of a beloved friend.”

Tiaré sighed.

“Ah, I wish I were ffteen again.”

Then she caught sight of a cat trying to get at a dish of prawns on the kitchen table, and with a dexterous gesture and a lively volley of abuse fung a book at its scampering tail.

“I asked him if he was happy with Ata.”

“‘she leaves me alone，'he said.‘she cooks my food and looks after her babies. She does what I tell her.She gives me what I want from a woman.'”

“‘And do you never regret Europe？Do you not yearn sometimes for the light of the streets in Paris or London, the companionship of your friends and equals, que sais-je？for theatres and newspapers, and the rumble of omnibuses on the cobbled pavements？'

“For a long time he was silent. Then he said：

“‘I shall stay here till I die.'

“‘But are you never bored or lonely？'I asked.

“He chuckled.

“‘mon pauvre ami，'he said.‘It is evident that you do not know what it is to be an artist.'”

Capitaine Brunot turned to me with a gentle smile, and there was a wonderful look in his dark, kind eyes.

“He did me an injustice, for I too know what it is to have dreams. I have my visions too.In my way I also am an artist.”

We were all silent for a while, and Tiaré fshed out of her capacious pocket a handful of cigarettes.She handed one to each of us, and we all three smoked.At last she said：

“Since ce monsieur is interested in Strickland, why do you not take him to see Dr. Coutras？He can tell him something about his illness and death.”

“Volontiers，”said the Captain, looking at me.

I thanked him, and he looked at his watch.

“It is past six o'clock. We should fnd him at home if you care to come now.”

I got up without further ado, and we walked along the road that led to the doctor's house. He lived out of the town, but the H?tel de la Fleur was on the edge of it, and we were quickly in the country.The broad road was shaded by peppertrees, and on each side were the plantations， coconut and vanilla.The pirate birds were screeching among the leaves of the palms.We came to a stone bridge over a shallow river, and we stopped for a few minutes to see the native boys bathing.They chased one another with shrill cries and laughter, and their bodies, brown and wet, gleamed in the sunlight.





Chapter LIV


As we walked along I refected on a circumstance which all that I had lately heard about Strickland forced on my attention. Here, on this remote island, he seemed to have aroused none of the detestation with which he was regarded at home, but compassion rather；and his vagaries were accepted with tolerance.To these people, native and European, he was a queer fsh, but they were used to queer fsh, and they took him for granted；the world was full of odd persons, who did odd things；and perhaps they knew that a man is not what he wants to be, but what he must be.In England and France he was the square peg in the round hole, but here the holes were any sort of shape, and no sort of peg was quite amiss.I do not think he was any gentler here, less selfsh or less brutal, but the circumstances were more favourable.If he had spent his life amid these surroundings he might have passed for no worse a man than another.He received here what he neither expected nor wanted among his own people-sympathy.

I tried to tell Captain Brunot something of the astonishment with which this flled me, and for a little while he did not answer.

“It is not strange that I, at all events, should have had sympathy for him，”he said at last，“for, though perhaps neither of us knew it, we were both aiming at the same thing.”

“What on earth can it be that two people so dissimilar as you and Strickland could aim at？”I asked, smiling.

“Beauty.”

“A large order，”I murmured.

“Do you know how men can be so obsessed by love that they are deaf and blind to everything else in the world？They are as little their own masters as the slaves chained to the benches of a galley. The passion that held Strickland in bondage was no less tyrannical than love.”

“How strange that you should say that！”I answered.“For long ago I had the idea that he was possessed of a devil.”

“And the passion that held Strickland was a passion to create beauty. It gave him no peace.It urged him hither and thither.He was eternally a pilgrim, haunted by a divine nostalgia, and the demon within him was ruthless.There are men whose desire for truth is so great that to attain it they will shatter the very foundation of their world.Of such was Strickland, only beauty with him took the place of truth.I could only feel for him a profound compassion.”

“That is strange also. A man whom he had deeply wronged told me that he felt a great pity for him.”I was silent for a moment.“I wonder if there you have found the explanation of a character which has always seemed to me inexplicable.How did you hit on it？”

He turned to me with a smile.

“Did I not tell you that I, too, in my way was an artist？I realized in myself the same desire as animated him. But whereas his medium was paint, mine has been life.”

Then Captain Brunot told me a story which I must repeat, since, if only by way of contrast, it adds something to my impression of Strickland. It has also to my mind a beauty of its own.

Captain Brunot was a Breton, and had been in the French Navy. He left it on his marriage, and settled down on a small property he had near Quimper to live for the rest of his days in peace；but the failure of an attorney left him suddenly penniless, and neither he nor his wife was willing to live in penury where they had enjoyed consideration.During his seafaring days he had cruised the South Seas, and he determined now to seek his fortune there.He spent some months in Papeete to make his plans and gain experience；then, on money borrowed from a friend in France, he bought an island in the Paumotus.It was a ring of land round a deep lagoon, uninhabited, and covered only with scrub and wild guava.With the intrepid woman who was his wife, and a few natives, he landed there, and set about building a house, and clearing the scrub so that he could plant coconuts.That was twenty years before, and now what had been a barren island was a garden.

“It was hard and anxious work at frst, and we worked strenuously, both of us. Every day I was up at dawn, clearing, planting, working on my house, and at night when I threw myself on my bed it was to sleep like a log till morning.My wife worked as hard as I did.Then children were born to us, first a son and then a daughter.My wife and I have taught them all they know.We had a piano sent out from France, and she has taught them to play and to speak English, and I have taught them Latin and mathematics, and we read history together.They can sail a boat.They can swim as well as the natives.There is nothing about the land of which they are ignorant.Our trees have prospered, and there is shell on my reef.I have come to Tahiti now to buy a schooner.I can get enough shell to make it worth while to fsh for it, and, who knows？I may fnd pearls.I have made something where there was nothing.I too have made beauty.Ah, you do not know what it is to look at those tall, healthy trees and think that every one I planted myself.”

“Let me ask you the question that you asked Strickland. Do you never regret France and your old home in Brittany？”

“Some day, when my daughter is married and my son has a wife and is able to take my place on the island, we shall go back and fnish our days in the old house in which I was born.”

“You will look back on a happy life，”I said.

“évidemment, it is not exciting on my island, and we are very far from the world-imagine, it takes me four days to come to Tahiti-but we are happy there.It is given to few men to attempt a work and to achieve it.Our life is simple and innocent.We are untouched by ambition, and what pride we have is due only to our contemplation of the work of our hands.Malice cannot touch us, nor envy attack.Ah, mon cher monsieur, they talk of the blessedness of labour, and it is a meaningless phrase, but to me it has the most intense signifcance.I am a happy man.”

“I am sure you deserve to be，”I smiled.

“I wish I could think so. I do not know how I have deserved to have a wife who was the perfect friend and helpmate, the perfect mistress and the perfect mother.”

I refected for a while on the life that the Captain suggested to my imagination.

“It is obvious that to lead such an existence and make so great a success of it, you must both have needed a strong will and determined character.”

“Perhaps；but without one other factor we could have achieved nothing.”

“And what was that？”

He stopped, somewhat dramatically, and stretched out his arm.

“Belief in God. Without that we should have been lost.”

Then we arrived at the house of Dr. Coutras.





Chapter LV


Dr. Coutras was an old Frenchman of great stature and exceeding bulk.His body was shaped like a huge duck's egg；and his eyes, sharp, blue, and good-natured, rested now and then with self-satisfaction on his enormous paunch.His complexion was florid and his hair white.He was a man to attract immediate sympathy.He received us in a room that might have been in a house in a provincial town in France, and the one or two Polynesian curios had an odd look.He took my hand in both of his-they were huge-and he gave me a hearty look, in which, however, was great shrewdness.When he shook hands with Capitaine Brunot he inquired politely after Madame et les enfants.For some minutes there was an exchange of courtesies and some local gossip about the island, the prospects of copra and the vanilla crop；then we came to the object of my visit.

I shall not tell what Dr. Coutras related to me in his words, but in my own, for I cannot hope to give at second hand any impression of his vivacious delivery.He had a deep, resonant voice, ftted to his massive frame, and a keen sense of the dramatic.To listen to him was, as the phrase goes, as good as a play；and much better than most.

It appears that Dr. Coutras had gone one day to Taravao in order to see an old chiefess who was ill, and he gave a vivid picture of the obese old lady, lying in a huge bed, smoking cigarettes, and surrounded by a crowd of dark-skinned retainers.When he had seen her he was taken into another room and given dinner-raw fish, fried bananas, and chicken-que sais-je, the typical dinner of the indigène-and while he was eating it he saw a young girl being driven away from the door in tears.He thought nothing of it, but when he went out to get into his trap and drive home, he saw her again, standing a little way off；she looked at him with a woebegone air, and tears streamed down her cheeks.He asked someone what was wrong with her, and was told that she had come down from the hills to ask him to visit a white man who was sick.They had told her that the doctor could not be disturbed.He called her, and himself asked what she wanted.She told him that Ata had sent her, she who used to be at the H?tel de la Fleur, and that the Red One was ill.She thrust into his hand a crumpled piece of newspaper, and when he opened it he found in it a hundred-franc note.

“Who is the Red One？”he asked of one of the bystanders.

He was told that that was what they called the Englishman, a painter, who lived with Ata up in the valley seven kilometres from where they were. He recognized Strickland by the description.But it was necessary to walk.It was impossible for him to go；that was why they had sent the girl away.

“I confess，”said the doctor, turning to me，“that I hesitated. I did not relish fourteen kilometres over a bad pathway, and there was no chance that I could get back to Papeete that night.Besides, Strickland was not sympathetic to me.He was an idle, useless scoundrel, who preferred to live with a native woman rather than work for his living like the rest of us.Mon Dieu, how was I to know that one day the world would come to the conclusion that he had genius？I asked the girl if he was not well enough to have come down to see me.I asked her what she thought was the matter with him.She would not answer.I pressed her, angrily perhaps, but she looked down on the ground and began to cry.Then I shrugged my shoulders；after all, perhaps it was my duty to go, and in a very bad temper I bade her lead the way.”

His temper was certainly no better when he arrived, perspiring freely and thirsty. Ata was on the look-out for him, and came a little way along the path to meet him.

“Before I see anyone, give me something to drink or I shall die of thirst，”he cried out.“Pour l'amour de Dieu, get me a coconut.”

She called out, and a boy came running along. He swarmed up a tree, and presently threw down a ripe nut.Ata pierced a hole in it, and the doctor took a long, refreshing draught.Then he rolled himself a cigarette and felt in a better humour.

“Now, where is the Red One？”he asked.

“He is in the house, painting. I have not told him you were coming.Go in and see him.”

“But what does he complain of？If he is well enough to paint, he is well enough to have come down to Taravao and save me this confounded walk. I presume my time is no less valuable than his.”

Ata did not speak, but with the boy followed him to the house. The girl who had brought him was by this time sitting on the veranda, and here was lying an old woman, with her back to the wall, making native cigarettes.Ata pointed to the door.The doctor, wondering irritably why they behaved so strangely, entered, and there found Strickland cleaning his palette.There was a picture on the easel.Strickland, clad only in a pareo, was standing with his back to the door, but he turned round when he heard the sound of boots.He gave the doctor a look of vexation.He was surprised to see him, and resented the intrusion.But the doctor gave a gasp, he was rooted to the foor, and he stared with all his eyes.This was not what he expected.He was seized with horror.

“You enter without ceremony，”said Strickland.“What can I do for you？”

The doctor recovered himself, but it required quite an effort for him to fnd his voice. All his irritation was gone, and he felt-eh bien, oui, je ne le nie pas-he felt an overwhelming pity.

“I am Dr. Coutras.I was down at Taravao to see the chiefess, and Ata sent for me to see you.”

“She's a damned fool. I have had a few aches and pains lately and a little fever, but that's nothing；it will pass off.Next time anyone went to Papeete I was going to send for some quinine.”

“Look at yourself in the glass.”

Strickland gave him a glance, smiled, and went over to a cheap mirror in a little wooden frame, that hung on the wall.

“Well？”

“Do you not see a strange change in your face？Do you not see the thickening of your features and a look-how shall I describe it？-the books call it lion-faced. Mon pauvre ami, must I tell you that you have a terrible disease？”

“I？”

“When you look at yourself in the glass you see the typical appearance of the leper.”

“You are jesting，”said Strickland.

“I wish to God I were.”

“Do you intend to tell me that I have leprosy？”

“Unfortunately, there can be no doubt about it.”

Dr. Coutras had delivered sentence of death on many men, and he could never overcome the horror with which it flled him.He felt always the furious hatred that must seize a man condemned when he compared himself with the doctor, sane and healthy, who had the inestimable privilege of life.Strickland looked at him in silence.Nothing of emotion could be seen on his face, disfgured already by the loathsome disease.

“Do they know？”he asked at last, pointing to the persons on the veranda, now sitting in unusual, unaccountable silence.

“These natives know the signs so well，”said the doctor.“They were afraid to tell you.”

Strickland stepped to the door and looked out. There must have been something terrible in his face, for suddenly they all burst out into loud cries and lamentation.They lifted up their voices and they wept.Strickland did not speak.After looking at them for a moment, he came back into the room.

“How long do you think I can last？”

“Who knows？Sometimes the disease continues for twenty years. It is a mercy when it runs its course quickly.”

Strickland went to his easel and looked refectively at the picture that stood on it.

“You have had a long journey. It is fitting that the bearer of important tidings should be rewarded.Take this picture.It means nothing to you now, but it may be that one day you will be glad to have it.”

Dr. Coutras protested that he needed no payment for his journey；he had already given back to Ata the hundred-franc note, but Strickland insisted that he should take the picture.Then together they went out on the veranda.The natives were sobbing violently.

“Be quiet, woman. Dry thy tears，”said Strickland, addressing Ata.“There is no great harm.I shall leave thee very soon.”

“They are not going to take thee away？”she cried.

At that time there was no rigid sequestration on the islands, and lepers, if they chose, were allowed to go free.

“I shall go up into the mountain，”said Strickland.

Then Ata stood up and faced him.

“Let the others go if they choose, but I will not leave thee. Thou art my man and I am thy woman.If thou leavest me I shall hang myself on the tree that is behind the house.I swear it by God.”

There was something immensely forcible in the way she spoke. She was no longer the meek, soft native girl, but a determined woman.She was extraordinarily transformed.

“Why shouldst thou stay with me？Thou canst go back to Papeete, and thou wilt soon find another white man. The old woman can take care of thy children, and Tiaré will be glad to have thee back.”

“Thou art my man and I am thy woman. Whither thou goest I will go too.”

For a moment Strickland's fortitude was shaken, and a tear flled each of his eyes and trickled slowly down his cheeks. Then he gave the sardonic smile which was usual with him.

“Women are strange little beasts，”he said to Dr. Coutras.“You can treat them like dogs, you can beat them till your arm aches, and still they love you.”He shrugged his shoulders.“Of course, it is one of the most absurd illusions of Christianity that they have souls.”

“What is it that thou art saying to the doctor？”asked Ata suspiciously.“Thou wilt not go？”

“If it please thee I will stay, poor child.”

Ata flung herself on her knees before him, and clasped his legs with her arms and kissed them. Strickland looked at Dr.Coutras with a faint smile.

“In the end they get you, and you are helpless in their hands. White or brown, they are all the same.”

Dr. Coutras felt that it was absurd to offer expressions of regret in so terrible a disaster, and he took his leave.Strickland told Tané，the boy, to lead him to the village.Dr.Coutras paused for a moment, and then he addressed himself to me.

“I did not like him, I have told you he was not sympathetic to me, but as I walked slowly down to Taravao I could not prevent an unwilling admiration for the stoical courage which enabled him to bear perhaps the most dreadful of human affictions. When Tané left me I told him I would send some medicine that might be of service；but my hope was small that Strickland would consent to take it, and even smaller that, if he did, it would do him good.I gave the boy a message for Ata that I would come whenever she sent for me.Life is hard, and Nature takes sometimes a terrible delight in torturing her children.It was with a heavy heart that I drove back to my comfortable home in Papeete.”

For a long time none of us spoke.

“But Ata did not send for me，”the doctor went on, at last，“and it chanced that I did not go to that part of the island for a long time. I had no news of Strickland.Once or twice I heard that Ata had been to Papeete to buy painting materials, but I did not happen to see her.More than two years passed before I went to Taravao again, and then it was once more to see the old chiefess.I asked them whether they had heard anything of Strickland.By now it was known everywhere that he had leprosy.First Tané，the boy, had left the house, and then, a little time afterwards, the old woman and her grandchild.Strickland and Ata were left alone with their babies.No one went near the plantation, for, as you know, the natives have a very lively horror of the disease, and in the old days when it was discovered the sufferer was killed；but sometimes, when the village boys were scrambling about the hills, they would catch sight of the white man, with his great red beard, wandering about.They fed in terror.Sometimes Ata would come down to the village at night and arouse the trader, so that he might sell her various things of which she stood in need.She knew that the natives looked upon her with the same horrified aversion as they looked upon Strickland, and she kept out of their way.Once some women, venturing nearer than usual to the plantation, saw her washing clothes in the brook, and they threw stones at her.After that the trader was told to give her the message that if she used the brook again men would come and burn down her house.”

“Brutes，”I said.

“Mais non, mon cher monsieur, men are always the same. Fear makes them cruel……I decided to see Strickland, and when I had fnished with the chiefess asked for a boy to show me the way.But none would accompany me, and I was forced to fnd it alone.”

When Dr. Coutras arrived at the plantation he was seized with a feeling of uneasiness.Though he was hot from walking, he shivered.There was something hostile in the air which made him hesitate, and he felt that invisible forces barred his way.Unseen hands seemed to draw him back.No one would go near now to gather the coconuts, and they lay rotting on the ground.Everywhere was desolation.The bush was encroaching, and it looked as though very soon the primeval forest would regain possession of that strip of land which had been snatched from it at the cost of so much labour.He had the sensation that here was the abode of pain.As he approached the house he was struck by the unearthly silence, and at frst he thought it was deserted.Then he saw Ata.She was sitting on her haunches in the lean-to that served her as kitchen, watching some mess cooking in a pot.Near her a small boy was playing silently in the dirt.She did not smile when she saw him.

“I have come to see Strickland，”he said.

“I will go and tell him.”

She went to the house, ascended the few steps that led to the veranda, and entered. Dr.Coutras followed her, but waited outside in obedience to her gesture.As she opened the door he smelt the sickly sweet smell which makes the neighbourhood of the leper nauseous.He heard her speak, and then he heard Strickland's answer, but he did not recognize the voice.It had become hoarse and indistinct.Dr.Coutras raised his eyebrows.He judged that the disease had already attacked the vocal cords.Then Ata came out again.

“He will not see you. You must go away.”

Dr. Coutras insisted, but she would not let him pass.Dr.Coutras shrugged his shoulders, and after a moment's reflection turned away.She walked with him.He felt that she too wanted to be rid of him.

“Is there nothing I can do at all？”he asked.

“You can send him some paints，”she said.“There is nothing else he wants.”

“Can he paint still？”

“He is painting the walls of the house.”

“This is a terrible life for you, my poor child.”

Then at last she smiled, and there was in her eyes a look of superhuman love. Dr.Coutras was startled by it, and amazed.And he was awed.He found nothing to say.

“He is my man，”she said.

“Where is your other child？”he asked.“When I was here last you had two.”

“Yes；it died. We buried it under the mango.”

When Ata had gone with him a little way she said she must turn back. Dr.Coutras surmised she was afraid to go farther in case she met any of the people from the village.He told her again that if she wanted him she had only to send and he would come at once.





Chapter LVI


Then two years more went by, or perhaps three, for time passes imperceptibly in Tahiti, and it is hard to keep count of it；but at last a message was brought to Dr. Coutras that Strickland was dying.Ata had waylaid the cart that took the mail into Papeete, and besought the man who drove it to go at once to the doctor.But the doctor was out when the summons came, and it was evening when he received it.It was impossible to start at so late an hour, and so it was not till next day soon after dawn that he set out.He arrived at Taravao, and for the last time tramped the seven kilometres that led to Ata's house.The path was overgrown, and it was clear that for years now it had remained all but untrodden.It was not easy to fnd the way.Sometimes he had to stumble along the bed of the stream, and sometimes he had to push through shrubs, dense and thorny；often he was obliged to climb over rocks in order to avoid the hornet-nests that hung on the trees over his head.The silence was intense.

It was with a sigh of relief that at last he came upon the little unpainted house, extraordinarily bedraggled now, and unkempt；but here too was the same intolerable silence. He walked up, and a little boy, playing unconcernedly in the sunshine, started at his approach and fed quickly away：to him the stranger was the enemy.Dr.Coutras had a sense that the child was stealthily watching him from behind a tree.The door was wide open.He called out, but no one answered.He stepped in.He knocked at a door, but again there was no answer.He turned the handle and entered.The stench that assailed him turned him horribly sick.He put his handkerchief to his nose and forced himself to go in.The light was dim, and after the brilliant sunshine for a while he could see nothing.Then he gave a start.He could not make out where he was.He seemed on a sudden to have entered a magic world.He had a vague impression of a great primeval forest and of naked people walking beneath the trees.Then he saw that there were paintings on the walls.

“Mon Dieu, I hope the sun hasn't affected me，”he muttered.

A slight movement attracted his attention, and he saw that Ata was lying on the foor, sobbing quietly.

“Ata，”he called.“Ata.”

She took no notice. Again the beastly stench almost made him faint, and he lit a cheroot.His eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, and now he was seized by an overwhelming sensation as he stared at the painted walls.He knew nothing of pictures, but there was something about these that extraordinarily affected him.From foor to ceiling the walls were covered with a strange and elaborate composition.It was indescribably wonderful and mysterious.It took his breath away.It flled him with an emotion which he could not understand or analyse.He felt the awe and the delight which a man might feel who watched the beginning of a world.It was tremendous, sensual, passionate；and yet there was something horrible there too, something which made him afraid.It was the work of a man who had delved into the hidden depths of nature and had discovered secrets which were beautiful and fearful too.It was the work of a man who knew things which it is unholy for men to know.There was something primeval there and terrible.It was not human.It brought to his mind vague recollections of black magic.It was beautiful and obscene.

“Mon Dieu, this is genius.”

The words were wrung from him, and he did not know he had spoken.

Then his eyes fell on the bed of mats in the corner, and he went up, and he saw the dreadful, mutilated, ghastly object which had been Strickland. He was dead.Dr.Coutras made an effort of will and bent over that battered horror.Then he started violently, and terror blazed in his heart, for he felt that someone was behind him.It was Ata.He had not heard her get up.She was standing at his elbow, looking at what he looked at.

“Good Heavens, my nerves are all distraught，”he said.“You nearly frightened me out of my wits.”

He looked again at the poor dead thing that had been man, and then he started back in dismay.

“But he was blind.”

“Yes；he had been blind for nearly a year.”





Chapter LVII


At that moment we were interrupted by the appearance of Madame Coutras, who had been paying visits. She came in, like a ship in full sail, an imposing creature, tall and stout, with an ample bust and an obesity girthed in alarmingly by straight-fronted corsets.She had a bold hooked nose and three chins.She held herself upright.She had not yielded for an instant to the enervating charm of the tropics, but contrariwise was more active, more worldly, more decided than anyone in a temperate clime would have thought it possible to be.She was evidently a copious talker, and now poured forth a breathless stream of anecdote and comment.She made the conversation we had just had seem far away and unreal.

Presently Dr. Coutras turned to me.

“I still have in my bureau the picture that Strickland gave me，”he said.“Would you like to see it？”

“Willingly.”

We got up, and he led me on to the veranda which surrounded his house. We paused to look at the gay fowers that rioted in his garden.

“For a long time I could not get out of my head the recollection of the extraordinary decoration with which Strickland had covered the walls of his house，”he said refectively.

I had been thinking of it too. It seemed to me that here Strickland had finally put the whole expression of himself.Working silently, knowing that it was his last chance, I fancied that here he must have said all that he knew of life and all that he divined.And I fancied that perhaps here he had at last found peace.The demon which possessed him was exorcized at last, and with the completion of the work, for which all his life had been a painful preparation, rest descended on his remote and tortured soul.He was willing to die, for he had fulflled his purpose.

“What was the subject？”I asked.

“I scarcely know. It was strange and fantastic.It was a vision of the beginnings of the world, the Garden of Eden, with Adam and Eve-que sais-je？-it was a hymn to the beauty of the human form, male and female, and the praise of Nature, sublime, indifferent, lovely, and cruel.It gave you an awful sense of the infinity of space and of the endlessness of time.Because he painted the trees I see about me every day, the coconuts, the banyans, the flamboyants, the alligator pears, I have seen them ever since differently, as though there were in them a spirit and a mystery which I am ever on the point of seizing and which for ever escapes me.The colours were the colours familiar to me, and yet they were different.They had a significance which was all their own.And those nude men and women.They were of the earth, the clay of which they were created, and at the same time something divine.You saw man in the nakedness of his primeval instincts, and you were afraid, for you saw yourself.”

Dr. Coutras shrugged his shoulders and smiled.

“You will laugh at me. I am a materialist, and I am a gross, fat man-Falstaff, eh？-the lyrical mode does not become me.I make myself ridiculous.But I have never seen painting which made so deep an impression upon me.Tenez, I had just the same feeling as when I went to the Sistine Chapel in Rome.There too I was awed by the greatness of the man who had painted that ceiling.It was genius, and it was stupendous and overwhelming.I felt small and insignifcant.But you are prepared for the greatness of Michael Angelo.Nothing had prepared me for the immense surprise of these pictures in a native hut, far away from civilization, in a fold of the mountain above Taravao.And Michael Angelo is sane and healthy.Those great works of his have the calm of the sublime；but here, notwithstanding beauty, was something troubling.I do not know what it was.It made me uneasy.It gave me the impression you get when you are sitting next door to a room that you know is empty, but in which, you know not why, you have a dreadful consciousness that notwithstanding there is someone.You scold yourself；you know it is only your nerves-and yet, and yet……In a little while it is impossible to resist the terror that seizes you, and you are helpless in the clutch of an unseen horror.Yes：I confess I was not altogether sorry when I heard that those strange masterpieces had been destroyed.”

“Destroyed？”I cried.

“Mais oui；did you not know？”

“How should I know？It is true I had never heard of this work；but I thought perhaps it had fallen into the hands of a private owner. Even now there is no certain list of Strickland's paintings.”

“When he grew blind he would sit hour after hour in those two rooms that he had painted, looking at his works with sightless eyes, and seeing, perhaps, more than he ever had seen in his life before. Ata told me that he never complained of his fate, he never lost courage.To the end his mind remained serene and undisturbed.But he made her promise that when she had buried him-did I tell you that I dug his grave with my own hands, for none of the natives would approach the infected house, and we buried him, she and I, sewn up in three pareos joined together, under the mango-tree-he made her promise that she would set fre to the house and not leave it till it was burned to the ground and not a stick remained.”

I did not speak for a while, for I was thinking. Then I said：

“He remained the same to the end, then.”

“Do you understand？I must tell you that I thought it my duty to dissuade her.”

“Even after what you have just said？”

“Yes；for I knew that here was a work of genius, and I did not think we had the right to deprive the world of it. But Ata would not listen to me.She had promised.I would not stay to witness the barbarous deed, and it was only afterwards that I heard what she had done.She poured paraffn on the dry foors and on the pandanus-mats, and then she set fre.In a little while nothing remained but smouldering embers, and a great masterpiece existed no longer.”

“I think Strickland knew it was a masterpiece. He had achieved what he wanted.His life was complete.He had made a world and saw that it was good.Then, in pride and contempt, he destroyed it.”

“But I must show you my picture，”said Dr. Coutras, moving on.

“What happened to Ata and the child？”

“They went to the Marquesas. She had relations there.I have heard that the boy works on one of Cameron's schooners.They say he is very like his father in appearance.”

At the door that led from the veranda to the doctor's consulting-room, he paused and smiled.

“It is a fruit-piece. You would think it not a very suitable picture for a doctor's consulting-room, but my wife will not have it in the drawing-room.She says it is frankly obscene.”

“A fruit-piece！”I exclaimed in surprise.

We entered the room, and my eyes fell at once on the picture. I looked at it for a long time.

It was a pile of mangoes, bananas, oranges, and I know not what；and at frst sight it was an innocent picture enough. It would have been passed in an exhibition of the Post-Impressionists by a careless person as an excellent but not very remarkable example of the school；but perhaps afterwards it would come back to his recollection, and he would wonder why.I do not think then he could ever entirely forget it.

The colours were so strange that words can hardly tell what a troubling emotion they gave. They were sombre blues, opaque like a delicately carved bowl in lapis lazuli, and yet with a quivering lustre that suggested the palpitation of mysterious life；there were purples, horrible like raw and putrid flesh, and yet with a glowing, sensual passion that called up vague memories of the Roman Empire of Heliogabalus；there were reds, shrill like the berries of holly-one thought of Christmas in England, and the snow, the good cheer, and the pleasure of children-and yet by some magic softened till they had the swooning tenderness of a dove's breast；there were deep yellows that died with an unnatural passion into a green as fragrant as the spring and as pure as the sparkling water of a mountain brook.Who can tell what anguished fancy made these fruits？They belonged to a Polynesian garden of the Hesperides.There was something strangely alive in them, as though they were created in a stage of the earth's dark history when things were not irrevocably fixed to their forms.They were extravagantly luxurious.They were heavy with tropical odours.They seemed to possess a sombre passion of their own.It was enchanted fruit, to taste which might open the gateway to God knows what secrets of the soul and to mysterious palaces of the imagination.They were sullen with unawaited dangers, and to eat them might turn a man to beast or god.All that was healthy and natural, all that clung to happy relationships and the simple joys of simple men, shrunk from them in dismay；and yet a fearful attraction was in them, and, like the fruit on the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they were terrible with the possibilities of the Unknown.

At last I turned away. I felt that Strickland had kept his secret to the grave.

“Voyons, René，mon ami，”came the loud, cheerful voice of Madame Coutras，“what are you doing all this time？Here are the apéritifs.Ask Monsieur if he will not drink a little glass of Quinquina Dubonnet.”

“Volontiers, Madame，”I said, going out on to the veranda.

The spell was broken.





Chapter LVIII


The time came for my departure from Tahiti. According to the gracious custom of the island, presents were given me by the persons with whom I had been thrown in contact-baskets made of the leaves of the coconut tree, mats of pandanus, fans；and Tiaré gave me three little pearls and three jars of guava-jelly made with her own plump hands.When the mail-boat, stopping for twenty-four hours on its way from Wellington to San Francisco, blew the whistle that warned the passengers to get on board, Tiaré clasped me to her vast bosom, so that I seemed to sink into a billowy sea, and pressed her red lips to mine.Tears glistened in her eyes.And when we steamed slowly out of the lagoon, making our way gingerly through the opening in the reef, and then steered for the open sea, a certain melancholy fell upon me.The breeze was laden still with the pleasant odours of the land.Tahiti is very far away, and I knew that I should never see it again.A chapter of my life was closed, and I felt a little nearer to inevitable death.

Not much more than a month later I was in London；and after I had arranged certain matters which claimed my immediate attention, thinking Mrs. Strickland might like to hear what I knew of her husband's last years, I wrote to her.I had not seen her since long before the war, and I had to look out her address in the telephone-book.She made an appointment, and I went to the trim little house on Campden Hill which she now inhabited.She was by this time a woman of hard on sixty, but she bore her years well, and no one would have taken her for more than ffty.Her face, thin and not much lined, was of the sort that ages gracefully, so that you thought in youth she must have been a much handsomer woman than in fact she was.Her hair, not yet very grey, was becomingly arranged, and her black gown was modish.I remembered having heard that her sister, Mrs.MacAndrew, outliving her husband but a couple of years, had left money to Mrs.Strickland；and by the look of the house and the trim maid who opened the door I judged that it was a sum adequate to keep the widow in modest comfort.

When I was ushered into the drawing-room I found that Mrs. Strickland had a visitor, and when I discovered who he was, I guessed that I had been asked to come at just that time not without intention.The caller was Mr.Van Busche Taylor, an American, and Mrs.Strickland gave me particulars with a charming smile of apology to him.

“You know, we English are so dreadfully ignorant. You must forgive me if it's necessary to explain.”Then she turned to me.“Mr.Van Busche Taylor is the distinguished American critic.If you haven't read his book your education has been shamefully neglected, and you must repair the omission at once.He's writing something about dear Charlie, and he's come to ask me if I can help him.”

Mr. Van Busche Taylor was a very thin man with a large, bald head, bony and shining；and under the great dome of his skull his face, yellow, with deep lines in it, looked very small.He was quiet and exceedingly polite.He spoke with the accent of New England, and there was about his demeanour a bloodless frigidity which made me ask myself why on earth he was busying himself with Charles Strickland.I had been slightly tickled at the gentleness which Mrs.Strickland put into her mention of her husband's name, and while the pair conversed I took stock of the room in which we sat.Mrs.Strickland had moved with the times.Gone were the Morris papers and gone the severe cretonnes, gone were the Arundel prints that had adorned the walls of her drawingroom in Ashley Gardens；the room blazed with fantastic colour, and I wondered if she knew that those varied hues, which fashion had imposed upon her, were due to the dreams of a poor painter in a South Sea island.She gave me the answer herself.

“What wonderful cushions you have，”said Mr. Van Busche Taylor.

“Do you like them？”she said, smiling.“Bakst, you know.”

And yet on the walls were coloured reproductions of several of Strickland's best pictures, due to the enterprise of a publisher in Berlin.

“You're looking at my pictures，”she said, following my eyes.“Of course, the originals are out of my reach, but it's a comfort to have these. The publisher sent them to me himself.They're a great consolation to me.”

“They must be very pleasant to live with，”said Mr. Van Busche Taylor.

“Yes；they're so essentially decorative.”

“That is one of my profoundest convictions，”said Mr. Van Busche Taylor.“Great art is always decorative.”

Their eyes rested on a nude woman suckling a baby, while a girl was kneeling by their side holding out a fower to the indifferent child. Looking over them was a wrinkled, scraggy hag.It was Strickland's version of the Holy Family.I suspected that for the fgures had sat his household above Taravao, and the woman and the baby were Ata and his frst son.I asked myself if Mrs.Strickland had any inkling of the facts.

The conversation proceeded, and I marvelled at the tact with which Mr. Van Busche Taylor avoided all subjects that might have been in the least embarrassing, and at the ingenuity with which Mrs.Strickland, without saying a word that was untrue, insinuated that her relations with her husband had always been perfect.At last Mr.Van Busche Taylor rose to go.Holding his hostess's hand, he made her a graceful, though perhaps too elaborate, speech of thanks, and left us.

“I hope he didn't bore you，”she said, when the door closed behind him.“Of course it's a nuisance sometimes, but I feel it's only right to give people any information I can about Charlie. There's a certain responsibility about having been the wife of a genius.”

She looked at me with those pleasant eyes of hers, which had remained as candid and as sympathetic as they had been more than twenty years before. I wondered if she was making a fool of me.

“Of course you've given up your business？”I said.

“Oh, yes，”she answered airily.“I ran it more by way of a hobby than for any other reason, and my children persuaded me to sell it. They thought I was overtaxing my strength.”

I saw that Mrs. Strickland had forgotten that she had ever done anything so disgraceful as to work for her living.She had the true instinct of the nice woman that it is only really decent for her to live on other people's money.

“They're here now，”she said.“I thought they'd, like to hear what you had to say about their father. You remember Robert, don't you？I'm glad to say he's been recommended for the Military Cross.”

She went to the door and called them. There entered a tall man in khaki, with the parson's collar, handsome in a somewhat heavy fashion，but with the frank eyes that I remembered in him as a boy.He was followed by his sister.She must have been the same age as was her mother when frst I knew her, and she was very like her.She too gave one the impression that as a girl she must have been prettier than indeed she was.

“I suppose you don't remember them in the least，”said Mrs. Strickland, proud and smiling.“My daughter is now Mrs.Ronaldson.Her husband's a Major in the Gunners.”

“He's by way of being a pukka soldier, you know，”said Mrs. Ronaldson gaily.“That's why he's only a Major.”

I remembered my anticipation long ago that she would marry a soldier. It was inevitable.She had all the graces of the soldier's wife.She was civil and affable, but she could hardly conceal her intimate conviction that she was not quite as others were.Robert was breezy.

“It's a bit of luck that I should be in London when you turned up，”he said.“I've only got three days'leave.”

“He's dying to get back，”said his mother.

“Well, I don't mind confessing it, I have a rattling good time at the front. I've made a lot of good pals.It's a frst-rate life.Of course war's terrible, and all that sort of thing；but it does bring out the best qualities in a man, there's no denying that.”

Then I told them what I had learned about Charles Strickland in Tahiti. I thought it unnecessary to say anything of Ata and her boy, but for the rest I was as accurate as I could be.When I had narrated his lamentable death I ceased.For a minute or two we were all silent.Then Robert Strickland struck a match and lit a cigarette.

“The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small，”he said, somewhat impressively.

Mrs. Strickland and Mrs.Ronaldson looked down with a slightly pious expression which indicated, I felt sure, that they thought the quotation was from Holy Writ.Indeed, I was unconvinced that Robert Strickland did not share their illusion.I do not know why I suddenly thought of Strickland's son by Ata.They had told me he was a merry, lighthearted youth.I saw him, with my mind's eye, on the schooner on which he worked, wearing nothing but a pair of dungarees；and at night, when the boat sailed along easily before a light breeze, and the sailors were gathered on the upper deck, while the captain and the supercargo lolled in deck-chairs, smoking their pipes, I saw him dance with another lad, dance wildly, to the wheezy music of the concertina.Above was the blue sky, and the stars, and all about the desert of the Pacifc Ocean.

A quotation from the Bible came to my lips, but I held my tongue, for I know that clergymen think it a little blasphemous when the laity poach upon their preserves. My Uncle Henry, for twenty-seven years Vicar of Whitstable, was on these occasions in the habit of saying that the devil could always quote scripture to his purpose.He remembered the days when you could get thirteen Royal Natives for a shilling.
